TWO HUNDRED WELL THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS TO APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT. A TODAY WHAT IS THE RESULT OF A NEGOTIATED AGREEMENT AMONG LEADERSHIP OF BOTH HOUSES IN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE. AS MANY OF YOU ARE WELL AWARE THEIR FAMILIES AND OVER THREE HUNDRED COMMUNITIES ACROSS OUR STATE WHO CANNOT DRINK. BAYS OR COOK WITH THE WATER THAT COMES OUT OF THEIR TAPS. ARSENIC LEAD URANIUM NITRATES CHROMIUM SIX IN T. C. P. ONE TWO THREE ARE JUST A FEW OF THE DEADLY CONTAMINANTS FOUND IN DRINKING WATER. THESE COMMUNITIES AND THEY'RE OFTEN LOW INCOME RESIDENTS HAVE LONG CALLED FOR THE CREATION OF A SUSTAINABLE FUNDING SOURCE. TO ADDRESS THE LONGSTANDING GAPS IN FUNDING NEEDED TO PROVIDE SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER. AFTER THREE YEARS OF RELENTLESS ADVOCACY COUNTLESS PRESS CONFERENCES COMMUNITY TOURS AND BUS TRIPS TO THE CAPITAL THE VOICES OF THESE FAMILIES HAVE FINALLY BEEN HEARD. SENATE BILL TWO HUNDRED REPRESENTS A COMPROMISE PLAN TO PROVIDE A LONG TERM. FOR SAFE DRINKING WATER. I PLUGGED THE GOVERNOR IN THE LEADERSHIP OF BOTH HOUSES FOR CRAFTING THIS SOLUTION AND HAVING THE COURAGE TO ADDRESS THIS CRISIS IN AN IMMEDIATE IMPACT FULL MANNER. SPECIFICALLY SB TWO HUNDRED WILL ESTABLISH THE SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER FUND UNDER THE DIRECTION OF THE STATE WATER BOARD. IN WILL TRANSCRIPT A HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR FROM THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND UNTIL THE YEAR TWENTY THIRTY TO PAY FOR SAFE DRINKING WATER SOLUTIONS IN DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. THE MEASURE REQUIRES THE WATER BOARD TO WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO DEVELOP AN ANNUAL EXPENDITURE PLAN ON HOW TO BEST ADMINISTER AND DISTRIBUTE FUNDING. IN A RESPONSIBLE COST EFFECTIVE MANNER THAT WILL PRIORITIZE SOLUTIONS FOR THOSE CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE MOST IMPACTED. BY UNSAFE IN ON AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER. IN DEVELOPING THE FUND EXPENDITURE PLAN THE WATER BOARD MUST CONSULT WITH AN VICE YOUR GROUP MADE UP OF WATER SYSTEM REPRESENTATIVES. pSERVED BY WATER SYSTEMS IN DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. ADDITIONALLY SENATE BILL TWO HUNDRED SPECIFIES THE NARROW. ALLOWABLE USES OF THIS FUNDING TO ENSURE FUNDS ARE SPENT IN A TRANSPARENT AND COST EFFECTIVE MANNER THAT ADDRESS THE ROOT BARRIERS TO PROVIDING SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER.

FINDING STATE NO SINGLE GROUP OF PEOPLE SHOULD BEAR A DISPROPORTIONATE SHARE OF THE NEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES FROM INDUSTRIAL GOVERNMENTAL OR COMMERCIAL OPERATIONS ARE POLICIES. AND SAFE DRINKING WATER DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTS PEOPLE OF COLOR THIS FUND PAIRED WITH APPROPRIATE ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS WILL WRITE THIS FUNDAMENTAL WRONG. CONCENTRATED ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION IN WATER CREATES HUMAN OF HEALTH BURDENS THE FINDINGS CONTINUE RESULTING IN COMMUNITIES WITH HIGHER RATES OF DISEASE SUCH AS ASTHMA HEART DISEASE AND CANCER. THE HUNDREDS OF RESIDENTS THAT YOU'VE SEEN IN YOUR COMMITTEE THIS YEAR AND IN YEARS PAST ADVOCATE FOR SAFE DRINKING WATER ONE DAY FIGHT INDUSTRIAL POLLUTION THE NEXT. BATTLE FOR CLEAN ENERGY THE DAY AFTER THAT -- AND STILL FACE DISPROPORTIONATE RATES OF CHRONIC AND ACUTE HEALTH IMPACTS. FINDINGS CONTINUE AGAIN THE CLIMATE CHANGE EXACERBATING THE WATER IMPACTS ON DISADVANTAGED ENVIRONMENTALLY BERMAN COMMUNITIES.

THAT I KNOW THERE ARE CERTAIN PEOPLE. WHO ARE IN THIS ROOM WHO? DID NOT LIKE THE WAY THIS BILL WAS FUND. BUT WE HAVE A VOTE ON THAT THAT OCCURRED IN THE ASSEMBLY A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO -- AND PEEP AND ANYBODY IS ENTITLED TO VOTE THE WAY THEY WANT TO VOTE BUT I'D LIKE YOU. TO PRIMARILY CONSIDER THE FACT THAT THIS IS A WAY THAT WE ASSURE CLEAN DRINKING WATER FOR THE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE IT. THAT'S WHAT THIS COMMITTEE IS FOR THE OUR AGAIN YOU'RE GOING TO VOTE THE WAY YOU'RE GOING TO VOTE BUT I WOULD SAY -- PLEASE VOTE WITH THAT CONSIDERATION RATHER THE CONSIDERATION OF HOW WE'LL ULTIMATELY FUNDED THIS. THROUGH THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND. THANK YOU ALL RIGHT COMMITTEES -- EXCUSE ME. ASSEMBLY MEMBER BAUER QUE HAN. YOU WERE FIRST THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. I'M. SO. THE CHAIR TOUCH A LITTLE BIT ON HOW THIS IS FUNDED WE HAD A HEARING. EARLIER IN THE YEAR ON CLEAN DRINKING WATER I THINK THAT. THE ENTIRE COMMITTEE THE ENTIRE BODY WANTS TO GET CALIFORNIA. TO SUPPORT CLEAN DRINKING WATER FOR EVERYBODY IT'S A TRAVESTY LEAVE ANYWHERE IN OUR STATE WERE CHILDREN CAN'T SAFELY BAY OF IN THE WATER -- AND SO I COMMEND YOU FOR YOUR WORK ON THIS FOR GETTING US THERE BUT I HAVE TO SAY THAT I REMAIN CONCERNED THAT WE HEARD IN THAT FIRST HEARING THAT. THERE AT LEAST 30% IF NOT MORE OF THE PROBLEM THAT HAS BEEN CREATED HAS BEEN CREATED BY POLLUTION. AND BY PEOPLE WHO HAVE POLLUTED OUR WATER. AND THAT THIS BILL LET THEM OFF SCOT FREE [inaudible] AND THAT. YOU KNOW I JUST WONDER HOW ALTHOUGH IT IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO TO CLEAN THE WATER AND GET CALIFORNIANS TO CLEAN THE DRINKING WATER AND THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT. HOW WE MOVED TO A PLACE WHERE WE NO LONGER HAVE PEOPLE POLLUTING OUR WATER IN PUTTING US IN THIS POSITION WHEN WE LET THEM OFF SCOT FREE? THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION THROUGH THE CHAIR. FIRST I DISAGREE WITH THAT CHARACTERIZATION NOTHING IN THIS BILL CHANGES EXISTING CALIFORNIA LAW WITH RESPECT TO ENFORCEMENT AGAINST POLLUTERS. THROUGH THE STATE WATER BOARD THROUGH THE REGIONAL WATER BOARDS -- THROUGH PRIVATE CIVIL ACTIONS PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION NOTHING IN THIS LEGISLATION CHANGES ONE IOTA EXISTING. RECOURSE TO LEGAL ENFORCEMENT INTO STATE ENFORCEMENT OF CLEAN SAFE DRINKING WATER LAWS NOTHING NOTHING CHANGED IN HERE WITH THE FIRST PART OF YOUR QUESTION. ASSEMBLY MEMBER I APPRECIATE IT I THINK THERE HAS BEEN SOME CONFUSION ABOUT THE NEXUS WITH USING G. G. R. OF FUNDING FOR THIS. IN HERE'S HOW I WOULD RESPOND THAT WOULD DRAG MEMBERS TO PAGE NINETEEN OF THE BILL -- OUR ASSOCIATE FROM [inaudible] LEGAL COUNSEL. MORE OR LESS. SHE'S OUR LEGAL COUNSEL THEM. LIMIT CHANGES EXACERBATING THE WATER IMPACTS ON DISADVANTAGE IN ENVIRONMENTALLY BURDENED COMMUNITIES BY REDUCING SURFACE WATER FLOWS ACCELERATING DECLINING GROUNDWATER BASINS AND CONTRIBUTING TO INCREASING CONCENTRATIONS OF ENVIRONMENTAL KAMAN CONTAMINATION. THE LANGUAGE GOES ON BUT TO ME THIS IS NOT A STRETCH AT ALL WE I THINK MANY OF A C. G. G. R. F.. TO PROTECT US FROM FUTURE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE THESE COMMUNITIES ARE THE CURRENT IMMEDIATE VICTIMS OF CLIMATE CHANGE. THIS IS USING R. G. G. R. F. FUNDS FOR FIRST AID EMERGENCY RESPONSE TO VICTIMS AND FOR THOSE WHO SAY WE SHOULD ONLY USE THAT MONEY TO LOOK TO FUTURE. POLLUTANTS TO FUTURE GREENHOUSE GAS GASES OR DISMISSIVE OF VICTIM COMMUNITIES TODAY THE SCIENCE IS CLEAR. AND I BELIEVE. YOUR SUPPORT FOR THIS WOULD BRING THAT FIRST AID TO OUR COMMUNITIES AND I THINK I MEAN THROUGH THE CHAIR I THINK IT'S CLEAR IN THE ANALYSIS TALKS ABOUT THAT. THE LEGISLATURE -- MADE SURE THEY DID YOUR OF COULD BE USED FOR ZILLIONS SEE FOR THINGS BEYOND WHAT IT WHEN ITS ORIGINAL FORM WAS CONTEMPLATED FOR AND I AGREE I THINK THIS FITS WITHIN THAT I GUESS MY CONCERN REMAINS THAT YES WE HAVE REGULATORY LAWS THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO STOP THE POLLUTION. IN OUR WATER CLEARLY THEY AREN'T WORKING. WE ARE WHERE WE ARE AND SO YOU KNOW I STILL THINK IT DOESN'T ADDRESS THE FACT THAT 30% OF THIS PROBLEM WAS CAUSED BY POLLUTERS AND A 100% IS BEING PAID I DO DRAFT. AND IF 30% WERE BEING PAID OUT OF A DIFFERENT SOURCE THE NOT CONTINUE TO DO THE GOOD WORK THAT YOU JEFF IS INTENDED -- FOR IN ADDITION I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT ACCOUNTABILITY AND OVERSIGHT OF THESE FUNDS THIS IS A CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATION WE'VE DONE THAT BEFORE AND WE'VE SEEN WHAT. PICKLE THAT HAS GOTTEN US IN -- AND I GUESS I'M CONCERNS THAT APPROPRIATING THESE FUNDS IN A CONTINUOUS FASHION WITHOUT PROPER OVERSIGHT TO ENSURE THAT IT IS ACHIEVING THE GOALS WE SET FOR IT IS -- SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE A PART OFTHE PACKAGE THE BILL THAT WE HAD PASSED OUT IS COMMITTEE THAT RELATED TO OVERSIGHT ACCOUNTABILITY I UNDERSTAND IT'S BEEN HELD. IN IS NOW TO YOUR BILL AND SEEING AS WE ARE DOING THIS ON AN EMERGENCY BASIS I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW THAT WE ARE ALSO. MAKING SURE THAT THESE FUNDS ARE BEING USED PROPERLY ON EMERGING FASHION AS WELL THANK YOU. AND I WOULD SAY I SHARE THAT CONCERN IN PRIORITY. AS MUCH IF NOT MORE THAN YOU DO BECAUSE OUR GOAL IS TO MAKE SURE THESE FUNDS. ACHIEVE THE INTENDED PURPOSE BUILT INTO THE BILL THAT WILL BE VOTED ON TODAY. INCLUDES AN ANNUAL ACCOUNTING. AN ANNUAL OVERSIGHT AND REPORTING TO THE LEGISLATURE SO I'M CONFIDENT THAT WE HAVE THE ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISMS BUILT INTO THIS THE WATER BOARD WILL BE ACCOUNTABLE. TO THE LEGISLATURE TO PROVIDE AN ANNUAL REPORT NOT ONLY OF THE PLAN THAT'S DEVELOPED FOR EXPENDITURES BUT ALSO HOW FUNDS ARE EXPENDED AND LET ME ADD TO THAT THAT SHOULD ANY OF YOU HAVE A CONCERN -- I CAN HOLD A HEARING. ANY TIME. WELL IF YOU IF ANY OF YOU BRING THAT CONCERN TO ME AND MY QUESTION IS GIVEN IN IT'S A CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATION WITH THAT WHAT DO WE DO WITH THAT REPORT WHAT IF WE FIND THAT THE WATER ISN'T BEING CLINTON THE WAY WE ANTICIPATED THE APPROPRIATION IS CONTINUOUS WITHOUT QUESTION. I GUESS THAT WOULD BE A QUESTION. THE LEGISLATURE OWES HOLDS THE POWER TO COME. EITHER THROUGH THE BUDGET OR THREE SEPARATE LEGISLATION IN ACCOUNTABILITY TO PULL AGENCIES IN FRONT OF US. YOU COULD CHANGE THE FUNDING MECHANISM THROUGH FUTURE LEGISLATION IF ACCOUNTABILITY SHOWS. THERE'S SOME KIND OF A GREGIS. MISAPPROPRIATION OR MISDIRECTION I WOULD HOPE WE WOULD ALL ENTER THIS TODAY WITH THE CONFIDENCE THAT WHAT WE'VE ACHIEVED IS HISTORIC BUT IT'S NOT FULFILLED INTEL THE CLEAN DRINKING WATER IS COMING OUT OF THE TAP. OF PEOPLE LIKE OUR WITNESS TODAY THAT WILL BE THE MEASUREMENT OF SUCCESS. I WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR THIS I KNOW THE OTHER STAKEHOLDERS WILL AND I WOULD EXPECT EVERYONE IN THE LEGISLATURE WOULD WANT. TO I WOULD LOOK AT IT A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY TODAY THROUGH THE LANDS OF AN ACHIEVEMENT. THAT IS ADDRESSING SOMETHING IS GONE UNADDRESSED SINCE THIS LEGISLATURE DETERMINED THAT ACCESS TO CLEAN SAFE DRINKING WATER IS A HUMAN RIGHT IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE'VE ESTABLISHED THE RIGHT. WE'VE GONE FOR YEARS WITHOUT FULFILLING THAT COMMITMENT. THIS BILL TODAY SENATE BILL TWO HUNDRED IS A GIANT STEP FORWARD TO GETTING CLEAN SAFE DRINKING WATER. TO OVER ABOUT A MILLION CALIFORNIANS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF MISTER MURATSUCHI THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS SHARE. I THANK YOU CEREMONY FOR CHAMPIONING THIS ISSUE -- LIKE A ONE OF THE MEMBERS OF THE AUDIENCE INDICATED TO YOU GOT THIS ACROSS THE FINISH LINE AND SO I MIGHT MY RESPECTS IT TO YOU I WILL BE VOTING FOR THIS BILL AND EIGHT YOU KNOW I ALONG WITH THAT MY COLLEAGUE. MS BARRICADE HAND I I'M NOT. TO YOU KNOW COMPLETELY HAPPY WITH ALL ASPECTS OF IT BUT YOU GOT IT DONE AND I I THINK LIKE YOU INDICATED THE BOTTOM LINE IS MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE. CLEANED -- AND SAFE DRINKING WATER FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS AND SO -- YOU DESERVE A YOU KNOW THE THE THE THE ACKNOWLEDGEMENT AND THE RESPECT FOR FOR CHAMPIONING THIS. YOU KNOW I I WANT -- TO YOU KNOW MAKE IT CLEAR FOR THE RECORD AS I DID ON THE FLOOR THE STATE ASSEMBLY THAT -- AYE I DO NOT PART OF THE THE GREENHOUSE GAS -- FUND -- YOU KNOW RATIONALIZATION -- BUT WE HAVE CROSS THAT BRIDGE AND AND YOU KNOW THIS IS THE LEGISLATURE AND SOMETIMES -- THE THE PROCESS IS MESSY BUT TO THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT WE GET IT DONE -- I ALSO SHARE -- MS BARRICADE ANSWER CONCERNS -- THAT -- BOTH OF US WE REALLY. GRILLED MISTER -- GARCIA ON YOU KNOW WHY IS IT THAT POLLUTERS SHOULD THE YOU KNOW WOULD NOT BE REQUIRED TO PAY MORE FOR THE CLEAN UP OF THE CLEAN DRINKING WATER AND AND YOU INDICATE I BELIEVE I HEARD YOU -- CLEARLY THAT THIS DOES NOT PREVENT US FROM GOING FORWARD -- CONTINUING TO WORK TO TO MAKE SURE THAT THE POLLUTERS PAY -- FOR THE THE PROBLEM THAT THEY'RE CREATING AND AND SO I THINK THAT IS -- YOU KNOW OUR CHALLENGE GOING FORWARD -- YEAH I I JUST WANTED TO DO A AND AND I I I HOPE THAT YOU WILL -- CONTINUE -- TO HI I WOULD LIKE TO WORK WITH YOU ON ON HOW DO WE GET THE POLLUTERS TO PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE ESPECIALLY WHERE. WE'RE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT -- IN NOT ONLY THE GREENHOUSE GAS. OF FUNDS BEING USED BUT ALSO THE GENERAL FUNDS -- THAT -- YOU KNOW. WE SHOULD HOLD THOSE THAT ARE CAUSING THE PROBLEM. ACCOUNTABLE OKAY THIS SENATOR IS HAS I THINK ANSWERED BOTH OF THOSE QUESTIONS AND SO IF YOU HAVE MORE TO ADD YOU CAN DO IT YOUR CLOTHES BUT I THINK YOU'VE ANSWERED BOTH OF THOSE QUESTIONS. A MISTER MATHIS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. CENTER MONEY OUT. WANT TO COMMEND YOU ON YOUR EFFORT ON THIS FIGHT -- WE HAVEN'T ALWAYS BEEN ON THE SAME SIDES OF IT. AND I DID VOTE NO AGAINST THE TRAILER BILL BECAUSE I DON'T THINK THE G. G. R. F. ON THE WAY THAT IT WAS DONE TAKING THE AGRICULTURAL MONIES AWAY -- WAS THE APPROPRIATE WAY. HOWEVER YOU AND I BOTH SHARED THE PASSION TO ENSURE THAT OUR COMMUNITIES THAT GET OVERLOOKED. GET THE RESOURCES THAT ARE NEEDED. THIS IS BEEN A LONG HARD FIGHT FOR MULTIPLE YEARS -- I KNOW THE PROPONENTS OF THE BILL WITH COMMUNITY WATER WE'VE GONE ROUND AND ROUND. BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY IT'S ABOUT PUTTING PEOPLE BEFORE POLITICS IN GETTING IT DONE FOR THE COMMUNITIES. I'M JUST HAPPY IT'S NOT A TAX SO I WILL BE VOTING. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER MATHIS MADAM VICE CHAIR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN -- SENATOR MINING I I THINK. WE ALL AGREE ON WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH HERE I THINK WHERE WE HAVE SOME DISAGREEMENT AS THE FUNDING THAT IT'S THAT IT'S BEING USED -- I REALLY AM HAVING A HARD TIME UNDERSTANDING THE JUSTIFICATION FOR USING CAP AND TRADE FUNDING FOR AN ISSUE LIKE THIS AND I WONDER -- IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK TO THAT AT ALL BECAUSE I'M SURE YOU HAVE. HEARD THE COMMENTS OUT THERE THAT THE STATE HAS A BUDGET SURPLUS -- WHY NOT TAP INTO THAT RATHER THAN USAGI OF FINES WHICH? IF YOU ASK ME IT'S A VERY WEAK LINK TO SUGGEST THAT THIS PROJECT WOULD REDUCE. GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS IT'S A IT'S A BIG STRETCH SO WHAT WOULD YOU JUST CARRIED IT -- EXPAND ON THAT BEAT BEFORE I HAVE A COUPLE OTHER QUESTIONS SURE THINK WELL AGAIN I APPRECIATE THE QUESTION IN. AGAIN TO ME IT'S NOT THAT BIG A STRETCH THE G. G. R. FUND. WELL IT'S DESIGNED TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. IT'S ALSO. PERFECTLY WITHIN THE AMBIT OF THAT FUNDING TO PROTECT VICTIMS OF CURRENT CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS. IT'S NOT ME IT'S SCIENCE THAT LINKS CONTAMINANTS IN WATER SYSTEMS TO DROUGHT DROUGHT CAUSED BY CLIMATE CHANGE WITH RESPECT TO KNOWN POLLUTERS NOTHING IN THIS BILL PREVENTS ENFORCEMENT OF EXISTING LAWS AND REGULATIONS. NOTHING PREVENTS THIS LEGISLATURE FROM CREATING NEW LAWS AND REGULATIONS ARE FOR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO CHOOSE TO GO AFTER POLLUTERS ALL OF THAT NONE OF THAT IS COMPROMISED BY THE LANGUAGE OF THIS BILL. BUT I THINK MORE BACK TO YOUR PARTICULAR QUESTION ABOUT THE NEXUS WE MAY HAVE TO AGREE TO DISAGREE ON THAT. I BELIEVE MUCH OF THOSE WHO LOOK TO G. G. R. F. IS PROTECTING US FROM FUTURE IMPACTS. ARE IGNORING THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT OUR CURRENT VICTIMS THIS BILL. PRIORITIZES THOSE COMMUNITIES IN IT IT CREATES A RECURRING FUND FOR TEN YEARS ONLY. THAT WE CAN'T PREDICT WHAT HAPPENS TO OUR GENERAL FUND BUDGET OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS. THIS GUARANTEES THAT THE INTENDED BENEFICIARIES OF ACHIEVING CLEAN SAFE DRINKING WATER WILL BE PROTECTED REGARDLESS OF EXIGENCIES. IN HOMAGE TO WE'VE ANSWERED THIS QUESTION TWICE THE SAME WAY -- WE DO WANT TO GET THIS BILL OUT QUICKLY SO WE CAN GET ON TO OTHER BUSINESS SO WE KNOW YOU CAN ALWAYS MAKE A COMMENT I'M JUST SAYING HE'S ANSWERED IT TWICE ALREADY. IF YOU NEED TO SAY ANYTHING MORE I CAN SAY IT WAS CLOSE. NOW IT'S FINE GOING TO YOU'RE NOT GOING TO WHATEVER YOU WANT TO SAY I'M FINE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I WAS TELLING HIM TO BE QUIET YOU. I GET IT ALL RIGHT -- SO. WE HAD AB ONE HUNDRED WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY THIS BILL RIGHT. WITH SOME WITH CHEN MINOR MINOR CHANGES BUT I NINETY BRALEY 5% OR MORE IS EXACTLY THE SAME BILL WHICH YOU'VE ALREADY HAD SEVERAL MEMBERS VOTE AGAINST AB ONE HUNDRED BECAUSE FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS THAT. THIS IS NOW AB ONE HUNDRED IN FRONT OF US AGAIN [inaudible] AND I JUST. I DON'T KNOW I'M SORRY MR CHAIRMAN I GUESS YOU JUST DIDN'T REALLY ANSWER THE QUESTION FOR ME TO SETTLE MY MIND IN THAT. THEY USE OF THIS FUNDING JUST SEEMS WHOLLY INAPPROPRIATE TO SUGGEST THAT IT WOULD REDUCE SIGNIFICANTLY ENOUGH TO JUSTIFY THE USE OF THESE FUNDS AS AS AS A KIND OF A SLUSH FUND. THAT SOMEHOW PEOPLE NOT TRUCKING WATER INTO THEIR COMMUNITY WOULD. CAUSE A REDUCTION ENOUGH TO JUSTIFY THIS I THINK IS LIKE SAYING IF YOU GIVE EVERY. GIVE EVERY SCHOOL KID AT A SCOOTER TO GO BACK AND FORTH TO SCHOOL THEN THAT WILL REDUCE THE NUMBER OF TRAPS TRIPS ARE PARENTS ARE MAKING. TO SCHOOL BACK ON BOARD TO PICK THEM UP THERE BY I MEAN I JUST I THINK IT'S A STRETCH. pIF YOU COULD. IF YOU COULD MAYBE DON'T WANT TO I MAYBE CAN'T BUT I REALLY WANT TO HEAR WHY WE ARE TAPPING INTO THESE. FUNDS THESE CAP AND TRADE FUNDS WHICH ARE SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED AND PROMISED THAT THEY WOULD GO TO SPECIFIC THINGS WHY WE ARE USING THAT RATHER THAN -- AT AND ALLOCATION OF FUNDS THAT ARE IN CURRENT EXISTENCE AND THAT WE COULD SET ASIDE RIGHT. IT BEGS THE QUESTION DO WE THINK IT'S ACTUALLY GOING TO COST MORE AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE NOT PUTTING HER DOLLAR LIMIT ON IT BECAUSE WE THINK IT'S GONNA END UP. IF YOU CAN ANSWER IF YOU CAN'T I UNDERSTAND NOW BUT I'LL BE BRIEF -- BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW THAT I CAN ADEQUATELY RESOLVE THE CONCERNS THAT YOU HAVE. I WILL SAY. THIS BILL PRESENTS A PATHWAY. TO ADDRESSING SUCH A CRISIS IN OUR STATE RIGHT NOW. AND IT DOES SO WITHOUT RAISING A TAX FOR A FEE WHICH WAS A STRONG INTEREST OF MANY MEMBERS OF BOTH OF OUR HOUSES. LEADERSHIP HAS AGREED UPON THIS I'VE OFFERED MY RECENT SWITCH DIDN'T INCLUDE TRUCKING OF BOTTLED WATER. THEY WENT MORE TO THE SCIENCE OF HOW STRESSED WATER SYSTEMS IN DROUGHT. PRODUCE MORE POLLUTANTS. THAT BECOME A HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF LESS WATER IN MAKE PREVIOUSLY DRINKABLE WATER. UNDRINKABLE THE CLEAR NEXUS TO CLIMATE CHANGE. IN OKAY SO THAT I DO ASK THAT ANYMORE QUESTIONS IN FUNDING BE ASKED BE ANSWERING YOUR CLOTHES THIS IS THREE TIMES THE SAME ANSWER. AND THAT'S OKAY BUT WE NEED TO GET ON TO OTHER PEOPLE HAVE QUESTIONS. I BELIEVE -- LET'S SEE WE'VE HEARD FROM YOU AND YOU SO THE NEXT IS -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA. THANK YOU AND I AND THEN OBERNOLTE IN ARAMBULA JUST A COMMENT AND FOR THE SAKE OF TIME NO ANSWER PLEASE. I NEEDED BUT YOU NOTICED YOU SET THAT -- PROGRESS IS GOING TO BE YOU AND WE HAVE CLEAN WATER COMING OUT OF THOSE TOUGH TO THESE COMMUNITIES AND AND I DO. I I DO SHARE THAT GOAL I THINK. I WANT TO ECHO SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT MY COLLEAGUE AT GOOD EARLIER ABOUT NOT JUST HAVING CLEAN WATER COME UP THE KEEPING THAT. AS CLEAN WATER NAY AND WITH THAT THAT WILL BE THE SUCCESS THAT I HOPE WE'RE WORKING. TOWARDS I UNDERSTAND THAT WE HAVE A SYSTEM RIGHT NOW WHERE WE COULD FINALLY -- TO BAD ACTORS ARE FOLKS WHO ARE RESPONSIBLE. BUT I THINK THE SENTIMENT IS THAT THAT THE SYSTEM HASN'T NECESSARILY BEEN WORKING THE WAY IT'S SUPPOSED. TO OUT THERE AND I THINK THAT THAT'S WHERE WE KEEP HARPING ON IT YOU KNOW CERTAIN INDUSTRIES ARE POLLUTERS -- AND THINGS THAT WE'VE HAD TIME AND OUT OF HERE TO GET THE VOTES DONE AND AND FIND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TO DAY IN THE ANSWERS THAT THE LEGISLATURE COULD COME BACK LATER IN THE CERTAIN. BUT PART OF THE PROBLEM IS THAT. THIS YEAR LAST YEAR SHOWS THAT WE DON'T ALWAYS HAVE THE APPETITE TO DO THE THINGS EITHER. AND SO -- I GET WERE OUT TODAY BUT IT DOES FEEL INCOMPLETE AND AND JUST FOR THE SAKE OF OF ON THE RECORD THAT THAT. IT DOESN'T ALWAYS FEEL SATISFACTORY IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO DELAY THE SOLUTION THAT THE WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE THAT NOW AND I WILL BE VOTING. FOR THIS BILL BUT I WOULD BE DISINGENUOUS IF I DIDN'T SAY THAT. THOSE ANSWERS ARE NOT ASSEMBLY. ANSWERS THAT I FIND TO BE TRUE BECAUSE THE STATUS QUO HASN'T BEEN WORKING. AND WE WOULDN'T BE HERE IF I HAD BEEN AND THE WILL OF THE LEGISLATURE IN THE POLITICAL. THIS IS NOT ALWAYS THERE BECAUSE IF NOT HERE TODAY I DON'T KNOW THAT IT'S GONNA BE HERE TOMORROW. ALL RIGHT -- MISTER MCNULTY AND THEN MISTER ARAMBULA THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I AM NOT GOING TO ASK YOU ABOUT YOUR OF ALTHOUGH I DO SHARE MIKE IN MY COLLEAGUES CONCERNS ABOUT THE SOURCE OF THE FUNDING AND I FRANKLY AM STRUGGLING WITH. WHETHER OR NOT THAT MERITS A VOTE IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL BECAUSE YOUR SERVING. A VERY DIRE NEED IN CALIFORNIA -- SO THE SOMETHING I'M THINKING ABOUT I WANTED TO ASK YOU ABOUT AN UNRELATED SECTION OF THE BILL WHICH IS SECTION. SEVEN AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I'M PUZZLED BY BECAUSE IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE REST OF THE BILL. SO CURRENT STATE LAW SAYS THAT IF YOU'RE GOING TO START A NEW PUBLIC WATER SYSTEM. THE STATE BOARD. CAN DENY YOUR APPLICATION BUT ONLY IF THERE'S A FINDING THAT YOU'RE UNABLE TO FULFILL YOUR MISSION EITHER FOR FINANCIAL REASONS OR FOR LACK OF ACCESS. TO A SAFE DRINKING WATER -- THIS BILLS PROPOSING TO REMOVE THAT REQUIREMENT AND LET THEM TO DIET WITHOUT CAUSE FOR ANY REASON I'M WONDERING WHAT THAT HAS TO DO WITH WHAT THE REST OF THE BILL'S ACCOMPLISHING THIS. THANK YOU I'M GONNA CHECK THAT TO OUR WITNESS HELD OUT A LACK. OF THE MY BEST SITTING THAT. ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS IS THAT SMALL WATER SYSTEMS JUST SIMPLY. AREN'T SUSTAINABLE EITHER FROM A LOT OF QUALITIES PERSPECTIVE OR TECHNICAL MANAGEMENT MANAGERIAL AND FINANCIAL CAPACITY. IN THE PROLIFERATION OF SMALL SYSTEMS. IT IS IS JUST EXACERBATES THIS ISSUE OVER THE OVER THE LONG TERM ESPECIALLY AND WE'RE LEFT WITH THE FINANCIAL BURDEN AS A STATE AND THAT'S THAT'S ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH TODAY. AND IF WE COULD STEM OF THAT KIND OF THAT THE PROLIFERATION STEM THAT TRENDTHEN WILL BE BETTER OFF ON KIND OF ON THE MEDIUM AND LONG TERM KIND OF FINANCIAL PATH. THE THE BILL DOES. REQUIRE THAT IF THAT THE THE BOARD FINDS THAT THERE'S ACCESS TO A NEARBY WATER SYSTEM. SO THE THE THE IDEA IS IF THERE'S A NEARBY WATER SYSTEM THAT'S A MORE SUSTAINABLE MECHANISM OF SECURING WATER TO THAT NEW COMMUNITY IN A NEW AREA. SO IT IS IT THERE THERE ARE CONDITIONS ATTACHED AND IT'S ALL KIND OF IN THE SERVICE OF CREATING A MORE SUSTAINABLE WATER INFRASTRUCTURE IN CALIFORNIA. I APPRECIATE THE RESPONSE I REPRESENT A VERY RURAL AREA THE STATE ARE THE SECOND LARGEST DISTRICT IN CALIFORNIA. AND MANY OF MY CONSTITUENTS DON'T HAVE THE LUXURY OF HOPE AGAIN TO AN EXISTING MUNICIPAL WATER SYSTEM AND A LOT OF TIMES WHEN WE HAVE THESE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT. ABOUT WATER SYSTEMS I THINK THAT RURAL CALIFORNIA IT GETS LOST IN THE DISCUSSION BECAUSE PEOPLE THAT REPRESENT URBAN AREAS I DON'T THINK THAT. THIS FEASIBLE FOR EVERYBODY SO IF YOU'RE GONNA MAKE A LITTLE DEVELOPMENT IN THE MIDDLE OF OF MY DISTRICT FOR EXAMPLE BUT SOMETIMES THE ONLY ALTERNATIVE IS EITHER HAVE EVERYONE ON THEIR OWN WHILE OR YOU INCORPORATE A SMALL MUNICIPAL WATER SYSTEM OR MAYBE THIRTY PROPERTIES. SHARE ACCESS TO A SINGLE WELL AND THERE'S A SETTLEMENT TO PAY FOR THAT AND SO I'M CONCERNED THAT MAYBE THIS IS CLOSING THE DOOR ON THAT AND WE'VE BEEN THROUGH THE DOWN THIS ROAD BEFORE A FEW YEARS AGO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HOLD WATER. AND AGAIN THE PERCEPTION IS THAT HOLD WATER IS NOT GOOD FOR PROVIDING SAFE -- AND HEALTHY DRINKING WATER TO CALIFORNIANS BUT THE NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES OF A LOT OF THESE REGULATIONS THAT WE PASSED IS THAT IT MAKES DEVELOPMENT. MUCH LESS LIKELY MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE AND A LOT OF THE AREAS OF THE STATE THAT WE NEED IT THE MOST. SO ARE I DO HAVE THAT CONCERN -- BUT I THANK YOU FOR ANSWERING THE QUESTION IF I COULD JUST BRIEFLY ADD. UP THE STATE WATER BOARD IS CURRENTLY DOING AN ASSESSMENT THE WATER SYSTEMS STATEWIDE THAT WILL INFORM THE PRIORITIZATION OF HOW THIS MONEY. IS ALLOCATED AND FOCUSED AND MORE CONSOLIDATION IS ONE OF THE PRIORITIES WHERE APPROPRIATE. WE RECOGNIZE IT'S NOT I ALSO REPRESENT A RURAL AREA SO IF IT'S MORE THAN A MILE CONNECTION THAT MAY NOT BE THE MOST ECONOMICAL WAY TO GO IT DOESN'T PROHIBIT. DEVELOPMENT THAT MIGHT RELY UPON. THE NEWLY DRILLED WELL OR CONNECTION WITH A SMALLER NUMBER OF USERS BUT THERE IS GONNA BE A PRIORITIZATION SWEARS HOUSE THIS MONEY BEST INVESTED TO SERVE THE MOST PEOPLE. AND I UNDERSTAND IT'S JUST THAT THE LANGUAGE IN CURRENT STATE CODE SAYS THAT CONNECTION HAS TO ANOTHER SYSTEM HAS TO BE FEASIBLE. AND THERE'S NO DEFINITION OF WHAT FEASIBLE MEANS SO THIS FEASIBLE ME IN. AND OUT LIKE IT WAS FEASIBLE TO SEND SOMEONE TO THE MOON LIKE THAT KIND OF FEASIBLE AS FEES WILL MEAN THAT IT'S NEXT DOOR -- AND I JUST BY BY GRANTING THE WATER BOARD. CARD WASH TO DENY THESE APPLICATIONS I FEEL LIKE WE'RE GIVING UP LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT OVER THE BOARD AND THAT'S WHY I WAS CONCERNED ABOUT IT. THANK YOU. I ALWAYS WANT TO GIVE FULL CREDIT TO MISTER OBERNOLTE FOR THOROUGHLY READING THE BELL AND BRINGING UP THESE ISSUES AND CERTAINLY -- THIS IS SOMETHING I'D BE GLAD TO TALK ABOUT NEXT YEAR AND AGAIN I'M WAITED READY TO HAVE OVERSIGHT HEARINGS. ARE WHENEVER THIS PROGRAM IS SUFFICIENTLY OFF THE GROUND AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS WANT IT. MR ARAMBULA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. CENTER MONNING FOUR YEARS AGO I BELIEVE YOU WORKED WITH MY PARENTS HELPING TO ADVOCATE FOR FARMWORKERS ON ISSUES JUST LIKE THIS.

AS WELL AS OUR SPEAKER IN OUR HOUSE AND THE PRO TEM WHO HAVE. REALLY MADE SURE THAT THIS BILL MEETS THE NEEDS OF ALL CALIFORNIANS AND IS REFLECTIVE OF ALL PARTS OF CALIFORNIA.

ALL RIGHT SENATOR -- PLEASE PROCEED THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS -- THERE'S BEEN CONVERSATION REACHED RECENTLY REGARDING THE FUNDING TO ENSURE ALL CALIFORNIANS RECEIVE SAFE AND RELIABLE DRINKING WATER IN THIS COMMITTEE JUST SPENT. A GOOD FORTY MINUTES -- DISCUSSING THAT FUNDING AND AND THE MECHANISM TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN. SO IT IT'S AN ISSUE THAT I'VE BEEN DEEPLY PASSIONATE ABOUT AND IT'S THE REASON THAT SB FOUR ONE FOUR IS BEFORE YOU TODAY. WORKS IN PARALLEL TO THESE OTHER EFFORTS AND SEEKS TO MAKE IMMEDIATE AND LASTING GOVERNANCE REFORMS. TO THE NEARLY THREE HUNDRED WATER SYSTEM STATEWIDE THAT THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD HAS IDENTIFIED THAT CHRONICALLY FAILED TO SERVE. CLEAN AND SAFE DRINKING WATER. THE SYSTEMS LACK THE FINANCIAL MANAGERIAL AND TECHNICAL RESOURCES NECESSARY TO ADDRESS ONGOING CONTAMINATION AND INFRASTRUCTURE ISSUES NECESSARY TO OPERATE HIGH FUNCTIONING WATER SYSTEMS. THE VAST MAJORITY OF THESE SYSTEMS ARE IN SMALL RURAL. CALIFORNIA SERVING DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES A SUSTAINABLE SOLUTION IS NEEDED TO ADDRESS THIS ONGOING HEALTH AND SAFETY CRISIS. TODAY LAWS HAVE BEEN PASSED THAT ADDRESS VARIOUS ELEMENTS OF THE WATER ACCESSIBILITY ISSUES HOWEVER IMMEDIATE AND LASTING CHANGES ARE NEEDED TO ADDRESS THE UNDERLYING ISSUES OF THESE FAILING SYSTEM. SB FOUR ONE FOUR PROPOSES TO MERGE THE SMALL NON COMPLIANT WATER SYSTEMS INTO LARGER MORE ROBUST PUBLIC WATER SYSTEMS THEY CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IMPROVED ECONOMIES OF CALE. STREAMLINED MANAGERIAL FUNCTIONS AND ENHANCED FINANCIAL CAPACITIES. THIS BILL IS DESIGNED TO COMPLEMENT EXISTING STATE BOARD CONSOLIDATION AUTHORITY INCLUDING THOSE IMPLEMENTED BY RECENT LEGISLATION AS WELL AS EFFORTS CONTEMPLATED BY THE LEGISLATURE. AND GOVERNOR AND GOVERNOR THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS AND IT WOULD ESTABLISH A NEW AND POWERFUL TOOL IN THE TOOLBOX. IN ADVANCE OF THE CONVERSATION TODAY I HAVE ALSO OFFERED UP AUTHORS AMENDMENTS IT WILL CROSS REFERENCE EXISTING POLICY AND PROCEDURES FOR THE STATE WATER BOARD TO DEVELOP. PROCEDURES FOR RESIDENTS OF A WATER SYSTEM TO PETITION FOR CONSOLIDATION INTO THE SMALL WATER AUTHORITY. I SIGNED FUNDING FOR DISSOLUTION INFORMATION PROCESSES AND INCORPORATED ADDITIONAL AREAS IN MEANS FOR PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT. WITH ME TO PROVIDE TESTIMONY TODAY ARE DANIELLE CODES OF EASTERN MUNICIPAL WATER DISTRICT AND DANIELLE BLANCHETTE OF CALIFORNIA MUNICIPAL. UTILITIES ASSOCIATION THE BILL SPONSORS. THANK YOU FOR MINUTES PER SIDE OKAY THANK YOU CHAIR QUIRK AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION OF SB FOUR FOURTEEN TODAY. I WOULD ESPECIALLY LIKE TO THANK SENATOR CAFIERO FOR LONG STANDING COMMITMENT TO THIS ISSUE. AS INDICATED I'M DANIEL COATS WITH EASTERN MUNICIPAL WATER DISTRICT OR A WATER WASTEWATER RECYCLED WATER PROVIDER TO NEARLY EIGHT HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND RESIDENTS IN WESTERN RIVERSIDE COUNTY. IS TRULY A CRISIS THAT ONE MILLION RESIDENTS -- CAN'T DRINK THERE'S WATER FROM THEIR TAPS DUE TO CONTAMINATION HOWEVER WE ARE PLEASED THAT THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR ARE IN THE PROCESS OF FINALIZING LONG TERM FUNDING SOLUTIONS ON ISSUE. WITH AN IMPLEMENTATION PLAN OF WHICH EASTERN IS IN FULL SUPPORT. WELL THE LEGISLATORS EFFORTS OFFER REMARKABLE PROGRESS TOWARDS ENSURING THAT ALL RESIDENTS IN THE STATE HAVE SAFE AND RELIABLE DRINKING WATER. WE BELIEVE THERE'S IMPORTANT ADDITIONAL STAFF. THAT WOULD ENSURE THERE'S A FULL PORTFOLIO SOLUTIONS AVAILABLE TO PROVIDE THE MOST SUSTAINABLE AND RELIABLE RESULTS POSSIBLE. WHAT THE STATE BOARD HAS EXISTING POWER TO CONSOLIDATE SYSTEMS ARE AUTHORITY IS CONSTRAINED IN SITUATIONS WHERE THERE IS NO VIABLE RECEIVING AGENCY? SB FOR FOURTEEN ADDRESSES THIS BY ALLOWING CHRONICALLY UNDER PERFORMING SYSTEMS TO DISSOLVE AND MERGE INTO VIABLE REGIONAL AGENCIES. WITH TECHNICAL FINANCIAL AND MANAGERIAL CAPABILITIES AND LOCAL REPRESENTATION. THIS IS ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH THE STATE BOARD ACTIVITY ACTIVATING A STEP BY STEP PROCESS WITH A DEFINED TIMELINE AND COMPETE COMMUNITY LEVEL ENGAGEMENT. FOR MORE ROBUST AND FUNCTIONAL SYSTEMS. AS AN ORGANIZATION EASTERN HAVE LONGSTANDING EXPERIENCE WITH CONSOLIDATING RIPARIAN SYSTEMS AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. M. AND WE HAVE USED THIS HISTORICAL BACKGROUND AS TO AND PROVIDE THE BACKGROUND FOR DEVELOPING SP. FOUR FOURTEEN WE'VE COLLECTIVELY CALLED THE COLLABORATED WITH MULTIPLE STAKEHOLDERS AND EXPERTS INCLUDING MUTUAL AND PRIVATE WATER COMPANIES ASSOCIATION CLASSICAL REPRESENTATIVES PUBLIC WATER PROVIDERS. ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ADVOCATES AND STATE FOR REPRESENTATIVES TO DEVELOP A BILL THAT NOT ONLY LOOKS. AT REGION LIES IN FILLING WATER SYSTEMS IT LOOKS AT THE UNDERLYING GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE OF THE SYSTEMS TO PROVIDE. THE LONG STANDING SUPPORT AND REASONABLE -- USES AND ABILITIES FOR THE SYSTEMS THE RESULT IS A BILL THAT WILL ULTIMATELY INSURED OF THOUSANDS OF FAMILIES WILL HAVE ACCESS TO SAFE AND RELIABLE DRINKING WATER FOR THESE REASONS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU. HOW MUCH TIME FILE ONE MINUTE AND FORTY SECONDS THAT I'M I'LL GIVE YOU ANOTHER TENANT? THANK YOU SO MUCH. CHAIR MEMBERS MY NAME IS DANIELLE BLESSED HIDING WITH THE CALIFORNIA MUNICIPAL UTILITIES ASSOCIATION WE ARE PROUD TO BE CO SPONSORS AND SUPPORTERS OF SB. FOUR FOURTEEN I'M AS NOTED BY THE AUTHOR AND ARE CO SPONSORED BENEFITS OF ESTABLISHING A SMALL SYSTEM WATER THIRTY ARE NUMEROUS. ON THIS BILL SAYS OF THE UNIQUE PROCESS FOR CONSOLIDATION. NOT A MERE OR SUPERSEDE EXISTING AUTHORITIES IF THE STATE WATER BOARD FINDS THAT THE CREATION OF A SMALL SYSTEM WATER AUTHORITY IS THE MOST APPROPRIATE SOLUTION. THE SUBSEQUENT PROCESS IS LOCALLY CONTROLLED AND TRANSPARENT WHICH WE BELIEVE IT'S CRITICAL TO LONG LASTING GOOD GOVERNANCE WE BELIEVE THAT CUSTOMERS CAN AND SHOULD FULLY PARTICIPATE IN DECISIONS RELATED TO THE DELIVERY OF SAFE DRINKING WATER IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. AND THE BILL HAS BEEN DRAFTED TO RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL STEPS. WE BELIEVE THAT BELIEVE THAT THIS TOOL IN THE TOOLBOX WILL EFFECTIVELY ADDRESS SYSTEMS THAT CANNOT BE CONSOLIDATED THROUGH OTHER MEANS. EVEN WITH THE RECENT EFFORTS BY THE STATE BOARD ON MANDATORY INVOLUNTARY CONSOLIDATIONS AS WAS NOTED. IN THE TESTIMONY ON SB TWO HUNDRED THEY'RE STILL -- HUNDREDS OF SYSTEMS AND A MILLION PEOPLE WITHOUT ACCESS TO SAFE DRINKING WATER EVERY DAY. OF I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT SB FOUR FOURTEEN WILL NOT DELAY EXISTING CONSOLIDATIONS AND IS NOT MEANT TO REPLACE OTHER AUTHORITIES. RATHER COMPLIMENT THEM AND ALLOW THE WATER BOARD TO SELECT THE OPTION THAT IS MOST APPROPRIATE FOR THE SITUATION. THE TIME IS NOW TO ADDRESS THESE CHALLENGES FACING OUR STATE WE ARE -- WE HAVE A FUNDING SOLUTION ON THE TABLE AND WE BELIEVE SB FOUR FOURTEEN PROVIDE THE SUSTAINABLE PATH FORWARD ON THE GOVERNANCE ISSUES. AND WE DRIVE OUT [inaudible] THANK YOU. YOU ARE ONLY THREE SECONDS OVER -- SHOW THOSE IN SUPPORT I SEE A LONG LINE AGAIN.

OPPOSITION VERY GOOD THANK YOU. PLEASE PROCEED YOU HAVE FOUR MINUTES. AT THE SCENE LEADERSHIP COUNCIL FOR JUSTICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY AND IT WILL. WE SUBMITTED A LETTER -- ALONG WITH CONSUMER ALLIED ORGANIZATIONS INCLUDING MANY WATER CENTER AND CLEAN WATER ACTION AND WE ARE EXTRAORDINARILY I THINK IT'S WE MAY HAVE MENTIONED EARLIER -- THANKFUL FOR THE CENTER COVER YEARS LEADERSHIP ON DRINKING WATER AND COMMITMENT TO THE ISSUE AND ALSO I'VE LEARNED THROUGH A COLLABORATION WITH THE CENTERS OFFICE. AND WITH THE SPONSORS THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS ISSUE AND ADDRESSING CONSOLIDATION AND ALL OF ITS DIFFERENT ITERATIONS -- WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH US CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE SPONSORS AND THE AND CENTERS OFFICE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE ADDRESSING THIS OPPORTUNITY. IN THIS NEED WE JUST DON'T FEEL THAT THIS IS THE RIGHT VEHICLE AND AS NOTED IN SOME OF OUR COMMENTS FEEL THAT THE PROCESS IS JUST TOO CUMBERSOME. WHICH CAN RESULT IN UNNECESSARY COSTS AND UNNECESSARY DELAY FOR SO MANY COMMUNITIES OF WAITED SO LONG FOR SAFE DRINKING WATER. PLEASE GO AHEAD. THANK YOU CHAIR AND MEMBERS JONATHAN NELSON WITH THAT COMMUNITY WATER SAID ARE -- WANT TO ECHO THE COMMENTS JUST MADE THAT WE ARE VERY GRATEFUL TO THE LEADERSHIP OF SENATOR CAFIERO ON SAFE WATER. I'M AND CLEARLY WE'VE SEEN -- THAT WHEN WE COME TOGETHER WE CAN MAKE TREMENDOUS PROGRESS SO IN THAT SPIRIT WHILE WE DO HAVE A CONTINUE TO HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THIS BUT WE WILL ALSO CONTINUE TO WORK TOGETHER -- AND THE DAY THE CONCERN THAT WE HAVE AGAIN IS THAT THIS. I WHILE THE INTENT IS RIGHT THE PROPOSAL IS A LITTLE TOO COMPLEX AND CUMBERSOME WERE WORRIED THAT WERE GOING TO CREATE A TOOL. ON THAT GOES IN THE TOOLBOX BUT THAT DOESN'T ACTUALLY GET USED AND WE HAVE TO CREATE A TOOL THAT'S GONNA BE USED. BECAUSE THERE ARE COMMUNITIES THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BENEFIT ROM THIS TYPE OF CONCEPT SO WE LOOK FOR TO WORKING WITH YOU -- AND TO GET THIS RIGHT BECAUSE WE NEED TO THANK YOU. THANK YOU ARM. OTHERS IN OPPOSITION -- JUST STAY THERE ARE WHAT THEY MAY BE QUESTIONS -- MARCH ASSEMBLY MEMBER MURATSUCHI AND THEN ASSEMBLY MEMBER BECKER. POWER QUE HAND AND THEN ANYONE AND THEN THE MADAM VICE CHAIR. SO I I I I HEAR THE OPPOSITION SAYING THERE YOU WANT TO CONTINUE TO WORK. OF AB BUT YOU KNOW I I KNOW A LOT OF TIMES. IF SOMETHING IS PASSED THEN PEOPLE SAY WELL WHY DO WE NEED TO DO IS WE WE ARE RATED PAT WITH DID SOMETHING LAST YEAR. AND AND SO NOW I AYE CAN YOU GIVE US A YOUR YOUR BEST EXAMPLES OF OF YOU KNOW. WHY YOU THINK THAT THIS MAY BE A TO COVER SOME -- TO TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE. SURE THE WE BELIEVE IT THE SPONSORS MENTION THAT THE STATE BOARD DOESN'T CURRENTLY HAVE THE TOOLS WE THINK THAT THE STATE BOARD THROUGH ESPECIALLY. INTO MINISTRY OF A STORY WHICH IS ACTUALLY -- SOMEWHAT IMPROVED THROUGH SB -- TWO HUNDRED THROUGH THROUGH THE ADMINISTRATIVE AUTHORITY AND THROUGH COLLABORATION WITH IMPACTED COMMUNITIES CAN CREATE -- THIS THIS ENTITY -- AND THAT THAT MAY BE A BETTER MECHANISM FOR DOING SO AND THAT THE THE TOOLS CURRENTLY EXIST AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT IN THE STATE'S IMPLEMENTATION. OF THE SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER FUND WE ARE INSURING IN CREATING THE OPPORTUNITIES TO ADDRESS CLEAN DRINKING WATER AND THE BEST WAY POSSIBLE FOR EACH COMMUNITY -- WE ALL KIND OF AGREE THAT THERE'S NO ONE SIZE FITS ALL SO I THINK ONE KIND OF FUNDAMENTAL DISAGREEMENT AS WE THINK THAT THERE ARE SUFFICIENT TOOLS AND STATE LAW AND THE ISSUE IS MAKING SURE THAT THEY'RE USED. CORRECTLY CAN A WITH THIS WITH COME INPUT FROM ALL OF US BUT ESPECIALLY THE SPONSORS WITHOUT SO MUCH ABOUT THIS. THERE'S A LOT OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT PROCESS THERE'S A LOT -- IT'S A BIT OF A GAME OF CHUTES AND LADDERS TO BORROW A TERM FROM. AN COULD COLLEAGUES IN DRINKING WATER THAT WORK TO COMMITTEE WATER CENTER FOR MANY YEARS. THAT THERE'S THE COMMUNITY COULD BE KIND OF IN GROUP IN WITH A REGIONAL CONSOLIDATION AND THEN YEARS DOWN THE LINE IT COULD THERE COULD BE A DETERMINATION THAT THAT. CAN REGIONAL ENTITY IS NOT SUSTAINABLE OVER THE LONG TERM AND THE AND THE THE PROGRAMMER PROCESS IS -- ABANDONED AND ARE BACK TO SQUARE ONE SO I WHAT WE'D LIKE TO SEE IS TO ENSURE THAT THERE'S A PRODUCT OF THEIR A ROBUST PROCESS OUT THE AT AT THE OUTSET. WERE DOING FEASIBILITY USING THE STATE BOARDS TOOLS CURRENTLY TO DO SO VISIBILITY ANALYSIS AND MAKE SURE THAT THE TOOL THAT WERE CHOOSING FROM THE OUTSET. IS GOING TO BE THE SOLUTION FOR THAT COMMUNITY IN THAT REGION. AND AND SO WHY DO YOU THINK THE THE CARD. IS SO EAGER SEND THAT SB TWO HUNDRED MAY PROVIDE ADDITIONAL TOOLS. TO TO TO MOVE IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION BUT IN THE THE COMBINATION OF SB TWO HUNDRED AND AND KIND OF COORDINATION WITH LEGISLATION THAT'S BEEN PASSED COME IN PAST YEARS THERE'S YOU KNOW SB EIGHTY EIGHT WAS. IS THE MANDATORY AUTHORITY FOR REGIONAL AND FISCAL CONSOLIDATION ALONG WITH SB FIVE FIVE TWO WHICH WAS ALSO WILK BILL THAT ALLOWED FOR ADMINISTRATORS -- AUTHORITY IN ADMINISTRATOR IN A TO GET NEW TOO MUCH TO THE WEEDS BUT AN ADMINISTRATOR COULD FOR EXAMPLE -- PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE MANAGERIAL SUPPORT FOR SEVERAL SYSTEMS AND IT MIGHT BE AND WE CAN ENVISION THAT THAT ADMINISTRATOR THAT THAT THE THAT ADMINISTRATORS A CUSTODIAN TO GET THE COULD SYSTEMS BACK IN. PLACE AND THEN THAT CONVERTS INTO A REGIONAL AUTHORITY FOR EXAMPLE WITH THE STATE'S EXISTING TOOLS THAT THERE BE A CONSOLIDATION AMONG THOSE SYSTEMS -- AND WITH OUT KIND OF THE PROCESS THAT NOW AGAIN THAT WE FEEL IS. TOO CUMBERSOME CURRENTLY AND FOUR ONE FOUR AND DOESN'T TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE TOOLS WE CURRENTLY HAVE -- THROUGH THE CHAIR MASS THE CENTER. TO ADDRESS THE ALL RIGHT SO ARE YOU HAVE A CHOICE EVENT NOW OR IN YOUR CLOTHES EITHER WAY IS FINE WITH ME I CAN DO IT IN MY CLOTHES. I'M I'M TAKING NOTES SO I CAN DO IT ALL TOGETHER FIVE LIKE TO I MAY HAVE FOLLOWED QUESTIONS ARE LIKELY HAD RESPOSTA. MAY HAVE FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS THANKS SENATOR RICHARD CHOI AND I'M I'M PREPARED TO TALK ABOUT IT RIGHT NOW SO LET ME JUST SAY pARE AVAILABLE TO THE STATE WATER BOARD ARE -- TO FORCE CONSOLIDATIONS WITH NEIGHBORING -- CONTIGUOUS BIGGER WATER SYSTEMS. THEY DON'T HAVE ANY AT THE READY TO GO OUT AND TO CONSOLIDATE THE INDEPENDENT -- INDIVIDUAL WATER SYSTEMS THAT YOU FIND IN RURAL CALIFORNIA AND SO WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS IT GIVES A MEDIC. FORTY UP BUT THEY HAVE TO GO THROUGH A LAUGH CALL LIKE PROCESS WHICH INCLUDES PUBLIC HEARINGS -- PUBLIC KNOWS IT PUBLIC NOTICE AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE COMMENTS -- THERE THEY ARE THERE IS ALSO A REQUIREMENT THAT THEY HAVE AN AN OPPORTUNITY TO VOTE FOR REPRESENTATIVES THAT WOULD BE ON THE BOARD. AS PART OF THIS CONSOLIDATED SYSTEM SO RIGHT NOW THEY THEY MAY HAVE NO BOARD MEMBERS BUT IF THE CONSOLIDATED THEY CAN BE FORCED TO HAVE -- UP PARTICIPATION AND SO ON IF THERE THE PROTECTIONS THAT ARE USUALLY IDENTIFIED AS IMPORTANT TO COULD TO PROTECT CONSUMERS -- THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HEARD AND HAVE MEETINGS AND TO BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WHAT IS BEING PLANNED AND SO -- IT'S IT IT IS CUMBERSOME BECAUSE THE PUBLIC PROCESS IS CUMBERSOME I MEAN THE RULES THAT WE HAVE TO FOLLOW UNDER THAT. THE BROWN ACT ARE -- FRANKLY MOST LOCAL GOVERNMENT PEOPLE SAY OUR PAIN RIGHT BUT THEY IT IT'S WHAT PROTECTS THE PUBLIC AND SO -- WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS IT CREATES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE WATER BOARD TO MAKE A DECISION ABOUT WHAT MAY BE IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THOSE PARTICULAR RESIDENTS? BUT THEN IT'S IT'S A PROCESS THAT THAT THAT ON THE LEFT THOSE HAVE TO GO THROUGH AS PART OF THAT AS PART OF THE OF MAKING IT HAPPEN. AND AND AND FRANKLY I AM IT'S MY MY BELIEF THAT THOSE THOSE PROCESSES ARE ARE TO PROTECT THAT THE RATE PAYERS AND THE CONSUMERS -- AND AND IF I COULD I THINK THAT THE ISSUE HERE IS THAT WE SOMETHING THAT'S GONNA LAST AND IT'S GOING TO ACTUALLY WORK AND THAT'S GOING TO BE FINANCIALLY FEASIBLE AND IT'S THE ECONOMIES OF SCALE THAT PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THESE. OUGHT TO BE CONSOLIDATED -- IT IS NOT A MANDATORY SYSTEM. IT IS A TOOL IN THE TOOLBOX AND THE WATER BOARD COULD DECIDE TO DO SOME OTHER PROCESS -- AND PART QUITE FRANKLY THAT THE THE RATE PAYERS MAY DECIDE THEY DON'T WANT TO BE CONSOLIDATED AS PART OF AT THE SAID THE SYSTEMS BUT IT LEAVES THAT IT LEAVES IT UP TO A PUBLIC AND PROCESS DID TO MAKE THAT DECISION SO. SO IS IT CUMBERSOME YES IS IT GOING TO COST MONEY YES IT IS BECAUSE ANYTIME YOU'RE GOING AND YOU'RE DOING A TAKEOVER. OF OF A SYSTEM -- YOU GOT TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE PROTECTING -- ALL THE CURRENT RATE PAYERS AND ANYBODY ELSE THAT WOULD BE CONSOLIDATED PART OF THE SYSTEM IS MY SECOND GORON READ WE NOW I RAN THIS IT WHEN I WAS IN THE ASSEMBLY AND GOT IT TO THE GOVERNOR'S DESK AND AND AND HE WANTED TO KNOW WHERE THE MONEY WAS GOING TO COME FROM IT AND WANTED THIS TO WORK ON THE FIX. WHICH IS THE AT THE SP -- ONE HUNDRED WHICH IS PART OF THAT PART OF THE FINANCING -- BETWEEN THE WATER BOND AND THE SP ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS THERE THERE THERE ARE RESOURCES TO BE ABLE TO MAKE MAKE THIS UP. THIS KIND OF CONSOLIDATION POSSIBLE FEASIBLE. AN ECONOMICALLY FEASIBLE THIS SUMMER I JUST I JUST WANTED. TO LET ANYBODY. AS ONE CHIANG. ALL THIS GOES NEXT TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT YES SO BETWEEN NOW AND THEN THERE'S TIME FOR EVERYONE TO WORK TOGETHER WE'VE JUST PUT OUT SB. TWO HUNDRED WHICH ADDRESSES SOME OF THE SAME ISSUES THE BE TIME TO MAKE SURE. THAT -- THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH SB TWO HUNDRED YOU WERE ASKING BEFORE WE DON'T WANT TO COME BACK TO THIS AGAIN THERE IS TIME IT GOES TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND I BELIEVE APPROPRIATIONS. SO THIS TIME TO WORK ON THIS BILL BEFORE IT GETS TO THE FLOOR THROUGH CHAIR THIS IS MY OPPORTUNITY I DON'T SIGNAL THAT'S OKAY I'M JUST SAYING I'D LIKE TO HAVE SOME QUESTIONS NO THAT'S OKAY YOU CAN ASK ALL THE QUESTIONS YOU WANT WHAT I WAS GONNA SAY IS. THERE IS TIME TO WORK ON THIS SOME MORE BUT THIS IS MY MY OPTED NO NO NO I'M JUST TELLING YOU THERE IS TIME WHICH IS GOOD THAT YOU'RE ASKING QUESTIONS THINK THAT'LL HELP YOU DECIDE WHAT TO WORK ON I APPRECIATE. ALL RIGHT SO SENATOR -- WHAT I'M HEARING A LOT IS AT THIS IS CUMBERSOME HEARING FROM BOTH SIDES OF THIS IS CUMBERSOME MEN AND AND -- AND SO A LOT OF TIMES WHEN I'M DEALING WITH A COMPLICATED ISSUE I LOOK TO WHO SUPPORTING AND HIS ACCOUNT'S. AND IT CONCERNS ME THAT ALL I SEE ARE THE WATER DISTRICTS THAT ARE SUPPORTING THIS. AND AND THE THE ADVOCACY THAT ARE OPPOSING THIS AND SO. I I'LL JUST LEAVE IT -- TO AND AS THAT AYE AYE. I YOU KNOW IN IN IN THE WORDS OF A TRIAL LAWYER AYE. THE THE THE OPPOSITION IS PLAN OF THAT. THE RESULT OUT OF MY MIND. AND I'LL LEAVE IT AT THAT THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT -- LET'S SEE WHO WAS AND WHO IS NEXT IT WAS SENT. TO I KNOW THERE'S ONE OTHER PERSON BEFORE I COME DOWN VICE CHAIR ALSO WANTED THAT WAS YOU ALL RIGHT. ASSEMBLY MIGHT ACTUALLY THERE IT'S OUR RUSSIAN JUST ASK MAYBE EXCEPT SO IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THE SENATE APPROPRIATIONS ESTIMATED ABOUT FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR THIS PROCESS TO HAVE THAT RIGHT. I'M NOT I I DON'T REMEMBER THAT OKAY THE TRUTH ANYBODY I CAN I CAN TELL YOU THAT WE HAD SOME NUMBERS FROM THE STATE WATER BOARD AS IT RELATES TO AB TWENTY FIFTY BUT WE'VE MADE SOME IMPORTANT IMPROVEMENTS THAT WE THINK WOULD REDUCE THOSE COSTS SO WE FEEL AS THOUGH. THE COSTS THAT WERE IN THE LATEST APPROPRIATIONS ANALYSIS WERE WERE MORE THAN WHAT THE BILL WOULD ACTUALLY COST TO IMPLEMENT. OKAY SO I GUESS YOU KNOW I GOING BACK AS YOU MENTIONED SB TWO HUNDRED INCLUDES IN AT THE ABILITY TO USE THESE TO YOUR OF FUNDS FOR THESE CONSOLIDATIONS WE JUST APPROVED WE JUST MOVE THAT BILL WHICH WOULD ALLOW FOR UP TO A HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS TO GET. CALIFORNIANS TO CLEAN DRINKING WATER IF THIS IS FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS OF THAT HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS WHICH IS TAKEN OUT FOR A CUMBERSOME BUREAUCRATIC PROCESS. BECAUSE I DON'T HALF THE MONEY. GOING TO THIS CONSOLIDATION PROCESS INSTEAD OF GETTING. OUR CONSTITUENTS TO CLEAN DRINKING WATER CAN YOU SPEAK TO THAT SO I CAN'T SPEAK TO THAT AND I CAN I CAN TURN IT OVER -- I THINK IT IS. IN ACCURATE TO SAY THAT THE SB TWO HUNDRED MANY WOULD FIND THIS. THIS WOULD PROBABLY BE A COMBINATION OF OF FUNDS THAT COME FROM -- BECAUSE THAT THE CONSOLIDATION IS ONE THING. RIGHT WHICH IS THE PROCESS FOR GETTING ALL OF THEM ON A ON ONE MANAGERIAL SYSTEM IN TECH TECHNICAL SYSTEM. AND THEN THERE'S THE ISSUE OF FIXING. THAT SYSTEMS THAT ARE CURRENTLY PROVIDING CONTAMINATED WATER AND THAT'S THE INFRASTRUCTURE. THAT NEEDS TO BE CHANGED OUT AND IT NEEDS TO BE REPAIRED AND SO -- AT SO YOU HAVE TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THE TWO AND IT'S MY BELIEF IS AYE RICK RECALLED THE BOND FUNDING -- WAS. FOR CONSOLIDATION BUT MAG MAY HAVE IT BACKWARDS IN THE SB TWO HUNDRED IS MORE FOR THE INFRASTRUCTURE -- AND SO SO WHATEVER THE AMOUNT IS. SO LET ME BACK UP AND JUST SAY YOU'RE LOOKING AT A CURRENT SITUATION. WHERE THERE ARE THERE'S NO MECHANISM? TO FORCE THE CONSOLIDATION [inaudible] OF THESE. SYSTEMS BETTER PROVIDING CONTAMINATED WATER. THERE IS NO MECHANISM. THIS IS A POTENTIAL MECHANISM AND WE WORKED REALLY HARD AT CREATING A SYSTEM. THE TREATS THE PEOPLE. DEREK CURRENTLY RECEIVING CONTAMINATED WATER WITH RESPECT. BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO BE INVOLVED IN A PROCESS IT'S GOING TO TAKE OVER THEIR WATER SYSTEM. AND THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO UNDERSTAND HOW THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN A PUBLIC PROCESS. AND TO BE ABLE TO THEN -- BE ENGAGED SO THAT THEY CAN ELECT. BOARD MEMBERS. THAT'S WHAT'S CUMBERSOME. BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO SO I DON'T I DON'T AGREE WITH THE ANALYSIS THAT IT'S CUMBERSOME I JUST I THINK IT'S PART OF A POLITICAL PROCESS BUT BUT IT PROVIDES THEM AND TREAT THEM WITH RESPECT SO THAT THEY CAN GET THEIR SYSTEM CLEANED UP SO THAT'S THAT'S ONE PIECE. IN TERMS OF THE FINANCING OUT OF I AM I PROBABLY GOT IT ALL PULLED UP SO WE CAN JUST GO BACK HAS. WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IS ESSENTIALLY ALLOCATING THOSE RESOURCES OVER FOUR YEARS SO WE ENVISION A LARGE? THAT PORTION THAT YOU'VE IDENTIFIED OVER FOUR YEARS SO IT'S NOT GONNA BE A ONE TIME. FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR ALLOCATION FROM THE HUNDRED THIRTY OR WHATEVER FUNDING SOURCES OUT THERE IT'S GOING TO BE. ALLOCATED OVER FOUR YEARS AS THIS PROCESS AND ROLLS. AND ROLLS AND WHAT I ALLUDED TO IN MY TESTIMONY IS THAT WE AREN'T JUST LOOKING AT A REGIONAL ALLIES A SITUATION WE'RE LOOKING TO REGION LIES OF WATER DISTRICTS. WE'RE LOOKING AT THE UNDERLYING GOVERNANCE WERE ACTUALLY FORMING NEW WATER SYSTEMS IT'S A NEW SYSTEM IN THE GUT AND AM. I KNEW PRINCIPLE ACT SO WHAT THE BILL DOES IT ESTABLISHES ALL THE POWERS THAT ARE NECESSARY FOR THE SYSTEMS TO BE SUCCESSFUL. WE'VE IT AND THEY'RE GOING TO BE SPECIAL DISTRICTS WE'VE HAD OUTLINED ALL THE TRANSPARENCY MECHANISMS THAT ARE NECESSARY WE HAD TO OUTLINE ALL THE ABILITIES THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH. AND THIS IS DONE THROUGH MULTIPLE ACTS BECAUSE WE ARE LOOKING AT CPUC REGULATED WATER SYSTEMS WERE LOOKING OUT PUBLIC WATER SYSTEMS ARE ALSO LOOKING AT MUTUAL WATER COMPANIES. SO WE'RE TAKING ALL THOSE DIFFERENT SYSTEMS TYPES DISSOLVING THEM AND THEN FORMING THEM INTO A NEW SYSTEM THROUGH A NEW PRINCIPAL ACT SO IT WELL IT APPEARS CUMBERSOME. IS ACTUALLY A ROAD MAP THAT PROVIDES VERY. DEFINED STEP BY STEP ACTIONS. AND I'M SORRY IF I MAY ADD WE DON'T HAVE TO ENVISION A FUTURE WHERE SOME SIT. FOR THESE DIFFERENT WATER SYSTEMS EVENTUALLY JOINED. WHERE IT PROVIDING A FUTURE WHERE THE SYSTEMS ARE TOO LARGE AND VIABLE AND TRANSPARENT? SO. AM I APPRECIATE THAT ACTUALLY APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS ABOUT GIVING. INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE SUFFERING FROM THIS CLEAN WATER PROBLEM CALIFORNIA VOICE AND I THINK THAT AND I APPRECIATE THAT. I GUESS WE JUST HAD A ROBUST CONVERSATION I THINK YOU WERE HERE FOR IT ON SB TWO HUNDRED ABOUT ALL OF OUR CONCERNS ABOUT USING TEACHER OF MONEY. TO GET TO CLEAN WATER AND THEN ALICE'S ON SB TWO HUNDRED ABSOLUTELY SAYS THAT. PROVIDE THE MONEY IS CONTINUOUSLY APPROPRIATED. BUT TO THE STATE WATER BOARD TO FIND THE FOLLOWING CONSOLIDATED WATER SYSTEMS TO FIND THIS PROCESS SO AGAIN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT USING DID YOUR OF FUNDS AND I THINK WE'RE GETTING FURTHER AND FURTHER AWAY FROM. OUR ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS AND TEACHES GIVES ME GREAT PIES. ALL RIGHT NOT A VICE CHAIR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN -- SO JUST IN LISTENING TO THE CONVERSATION ABOUT YOUR OWN COMMENTS ABOUT TREATING YOU KNOW THESE FOLKS WITH. RESPECT IN THE COMMENTS OF MY COMMITTEE MEMBERS TALKING ABOUT THIS BEING A TRANSPARENT PROCESS THE THING THAT STICKING WITH ME THE MOST IS IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THESE -- SMALL WATER AUTHORITIES COULD ISSUE BONDS WITHOUT VOTER APPROVAL [inaudible] WHY? YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE CONSOLIDATED YES SYSTEMS. YEAH THE BILL ENABLES THESE SYSTEMS TO PASS REVENUE BONDS AND THAT IS A METHOD I KNOW WHAT A REVENUE BOND IS WIRE WHEEL AGAIN IF YOU COULD JUST ANSWER. OKAY IT'S A METHOD OF FINANCING -- THAT IS WIDELY USED THROUGHOUT THE WATER AND WASTEWATER INDUSTRIES. AND DO YOU HAVE AN POWER THESE DISTRICTS TO UTILIZE. ALL THE TOOLS IN THE TOOLBOX TO ENSURE THERE IS THE ABILITY. TO PROVIDE THE INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE MOST TIMELY AND SENSITIVE MANNER BY BY PASSING THE VOTERS. THERE WE ARE SPEAKING OF A VERY DEFINED AND SMALL UNIVERSE THAT ARE ABLE TO UTILIZE ALL THE TOOL BOXES ARE ALL THE TOOLS IN THE TOOLBOX THAT CURRENT WATER AGENCIES UTILIZE. WE HAVE OVERSIGHT BUILT INTO THE BILL BY THE STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE BY THE LAUGH GO. BY ALL THESE DIFFERENT ENTITIES TO ENSURE AND AS WAS IDENTIFIED IN THE SENATE GOVERNANCE AND FINANCE HEARING ON AB. TWENTY FIFTY AT THIS TIME THERE IS NO KNOWN DEFAULT ON A REVENUE BOND. BUY PULP SO AGAIN I GO BACK. TO IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE SAYING AS LONG AS THE UNIVERSE IS VERY VERY SMALL IT'S OKAY TO NOT GO THROUGH THE NORMAL PROCESS AND OKAY TO BY PASS THE VOTERS WHICH IS NOT THE NORM. IN ANY OTHER CASE WHEN YOU'RE ISSUING BONDS AT THE VOTERS HAVE A CHOICE THAT VOTERS WOULD HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO CLAW THAT BACK BUT THEY WOULD HAVE TO DO THAT WITH THE REFERENDUM WHICH I THINK IS BACKWARDS IN IS NOT RESPECTFUL. TO THE PEOPLE THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO SERVE TO WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO IS WONDERFUL IT'S JUST THIS PARTICULAR PART WHERE YOU'RE SAYING BASICALLY IT'S JUST GONNA BE EASIER FOR US TO DO THIS IF WE JUST DON'T ALLOW THE VOTERS TO WAY AND I THINK THAT'S INAPPROPRIATE. AND I THINK IT'S AN ANSWER WRONG. SOUND [inaudible] I'M. ALSO I HAVE A QUESTION DON'T WE ALLOW ALL THE WATER DISTRICTS TO DO THIS TO HAVE REVENUE BONDS ALL THE SEWER DISTRICTS DON'T THEY ALL HAVE THIS A TOWARD. MY KNOWLEDGE THAT YEAH I MEAN CERTAINLY THE CITY OF HEY WHERE DO WE DID -- REVENUE BOND -- TO DO OUR SEWER SYSTEM THAT IS PAID FOR BY SEWER FEES IT'S NOT REQUIRED TO GO BEFORE THE VOTERS. OF SAME WITH THE S. F. P. YOU SEE WHICH AND AND OTHER AGENCIES -- THEY'RE ALLOWED TO FUND THAT THROUGH FEES. IT'S IT'S NORMAL HONEST ALL THE BIG WEATHER DISTRICTS DO IT OUR YOUR OBERNOLTE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I HAD A QUESTION ABOUT THE METHOD ON WHICH AB FORCIBLY CONSOLIDATE WATER SYSTEM IS VALUED. SO THE BILL HAS A SECTION ON THIS AND IT SAYS THAT TO VALUE IT YOU DO A DISTRESSED BUSINESS VALUATION. WHICH ARE MOST ACCOUNTS WILL BE FAMILIAR WITH YOU TAKE ALL THE ASSET YOU SUBTRACT ALL THE LIABILITIES BUT IT'S GOT. ANOTHER PART THAT SAYS THAT YOU ALSO SUBTRACT. THE COST REQUIRED TO BRING. NOT JUST THE EQUIPMENT BUT THE DRINKING WATER TREATED UP TO STATE STANDARDS. A ON OUR THAT CAUSED SOME CONCERN FOR ME BECAUSE IT'S NOT AN UNREASONABLE SITUATION TO THINK OF A WATER DISTRICT THE COULDN'T AFFORD. THE EQUIPMENT REQUIRED TO TREAT THE WATER UP TO THE STATE'S STANDARDS AND THAT'S WHY THEY'RE DISTRESSED IN THE FIRST PLACE IN FACT I HAD A MEETING IN MY DISTRICT OFFICE. ON FRIDAY WITH BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF A WATER DISTRICT THAT IS EXACTLY THAT SAME SITUATION SO I MEAN IF YOU SAY THAT. THE A A DISTRICT JUST BOUGHT A MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF EQUIPMENT. BUT THEY CAN'T AFFORD THE TEN MILLION DOLLARS IT WOULD TAKE. FOR THE EQUIPMENT -- TO TREAT THE ACROMION REMOVE CHROMIUM SIX OR URANIUM OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT -- TO SAY THAT THEY ARE WORTH NEGATIVE NINE MILLION DOLLARS DOESN'T SEEM RIGHT TO ME SO COULD YOU TALK A BIT ABOUT THAT METHOD EVALUATION BECAUSE I'M VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THAT. I GIVE IDENTIFIED THE METHOD -- CORRECTLY BUT WE DO BELIEVE THAT IN ANY SCENARIO THERE'S GOING TO HAVE TO BE -- SOME ENTITY THAT'S GOING TO HAVE TO BRING THAT SYSTEM UP TO COMPLIANCE AND SO SHOULD THAT SYSTEM GET VALUE. FOR WHAT IS ULTIMATELY GOING TO HAVE TO OCCUR. YEAH BUT YOU'RE SEIZING HIS PROPERTY. YOU'VE GOT LIKE THESE SMALL MUTUAL WATER COMPANIES MIGHT HAVE THEIR OWN SHAREHOLDERS THAT HAVE MADE AN INVESTMENT IN THIS. IN THIS WATER DISTRICT AND IT'S A STATE STANDARD IN MANY CASES THAT'S FORCING THE FINANCIAL DISTRESS ON THE WATER DISTRICTS ARE I'M VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THE FACT THAT YOU KNOW WE DECIDE AS A STATE WHAT OUR MINIMUM STANDARDS ARE. IF WE HAVE WATER DISTRICTS THEY'RE HAVING TROUBLE WE CREE GRANT FUNDS TO TELL THOSE WATER DISTRICT OUT THAT'S ALL WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE BUT TO SAY. TO THE EXISTING OWNERS OF THAT PROPERTY YOU GET NOTHING SEEMS TOTALLY WRONG TO ME. WELL I UNDERSTAND YOUR YOUR POSITION EXCEPT FOR THAT HAD THEY TAKEN. CARE OF THE PROBLEM THEN THEY WOULD BE PROVIDING CONTAMINATED WATER TO PEOPLE I MEAN THAT MEANS AND LET ME JUST TELL YOU THAT MANY OF THE COMMUNITIES IN MY DISTRICT. THEY ARE BEING PROVIDED WITH WATER THAT THEY CANNOT USE THEY GET CHARGED. MOM AND IN A COUPLE OF THE OF THE DISTRICTS IT'S IN EXCESS OF A HUNDRED DOLLARS SO THEY HAVE TO PAY FOR WATER THE DATE THEN CAN'T DRINKING CAN BE THEN. AND AND IT'S A IT'S A MINIMUM FEE AND SO PART OF THE CHALLENGE THAT WE HAVE IS HOW DO YOU. HOW DO YOU CREATE AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABLE TO INVEST RESPONSIBLY IN THOSE WATER SYSTEMS ONCE THEY'VE THEY'VE BEEN THE POINT WHEN SHE STARTED CONSOLIDATION PROCESS? AND IS ARE THEY ENTITLED TO GET PAID FOR SOMETHING -- THAT THAT IS NOT NOT MEETING STATE STANDARDS BY A LONG SHOT I THIS ISN'T EVEN CLOSE IT'S IT'S BY A LONG SHOT AND SO -- IT ACT THE PART OF THE IT'S PART OF THE REPERCUSSIONS OF IT AND AND WE WE WE DID IT THAT WAY SPECIFICALLY SO THAT WE ARE WE HAD WAITED TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THE INVESTMENTS IN IN. THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S GOING TO BE NEEDED. OKAY SO LET ME PROVIDE YOU A COUNTER EXAMPLE FROM MY DISTRICT -- I'VE WATER DISTRICT THAT HAS A CHROMIUM SIX PROBLEM. AND IT'S NATURALLY OCCURRING AND THEY DIDN'T USED TO HAVE A PROBLEM BECAUSE THE STATE STANDARDS WAS HIGHER DROP THAT USED TO BE AND AND SO EVERY TIME DETECTION TECHNOLOGY IMPROVES WE LOWER THE STATE'S STANDARDS SO WE'RE NOT LOWERED IT TO THE POINT WHERE. THEY HAVE A PROBLEM AND INVESTING. THIS PARTICULAR DISTRICT I THINK WE FOUND A WAY OUT FOR THEM BUT ORIGINALLY LOOKED LIKE INVESTING IN THE EQUIPMENT TO REMOVE THEIR CHROMIUM. SIX WAS WAS GOING TO BANKRUPT THE DISTRICT THERE'S NO WAY FOR THEM TO DO IT. THE SHARES OF STOCK IN THAT DISTRICT HAVE BEEN IN -- A FAMILY FOR GENERATIONS -- WAS LIKE THE GRANDPA SMITH STARTED YOU KNOW WHEN THE AREA WAS FIRST SETTLED TO SAY AND AND THEY MADE SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENT -- IN THE SYSTEM SINCE THEN TO SAY TO THAT FAMILY. THAT YOUR SHARES ARE WORTH NOTHING BECAUSE OF A DECISION THAT WE MADE HERE IN THIS BUILDING I THINK IS WRONG. SO THE REST OF THE VALUATION I THINK IT'S FAIR THAT PARTICULAR PART OF THE VALUATION HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS THE STATE OF REPAIR OF THE EQUIPMENT HAS NOTHING TO DO. WITH THE DUE DILIGENCE THAT THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF EXERCISE BECAUSE LIKE I SAID IT'S A DECISION THAT WE MADE HERE SO I I I OUR OUR TO RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE ON THAT POINT -- THAT'S ONE OF THE BIG CONCERNS THAT I HAVE THIS WITH WITH THIS BILL SOFTER RESPECTFULLY THE OPPOSITION I UNDERSTAND IT AND THE THE SOLUTION TO THAT IS THAT THEY DON'T GET CONSOLIDATED AND THAT THE FIGURE OUT ANOTHER SOLUTION TO BE ABLE TO COME. AT TO RESOLVE THE CHROMIUM SIX BECAUSE THIS IS AN OPTIONAL THIS IS AN OPTION IT'S NOT IT'S NOT MANDATORY YOU KEEP IT. HERE YOU KNOW YOU CAN BE YOU CAN BE CONSIDERED PART OF THE SYSTEM BUT THERE'S THIS WHOLE PUBLIC PROCESS THAT PEOPLE CAN EXTRACT THEMSELVES OUT OF OUT OF THAT. OUT OF THE CONSOLIDATION SO SO THERE'S OPTION I GUESS IS THE POINT IS MY POINT OKAY I'M NOT I'M NOT TRYING TO CHANGE YOUR OPINION NUMBER UNDERSTAND. THAT YOU'RE RIGHT AND I HOPE TO SOME OF THE ACTIONS WE'VE TAKEN TODAY CREATE ENOUGH FUNDING. SO THAT WE CAN SAVE A SMALL WATER DISTRICTS LIKE THAT. ONE YES WE REALIZE THAT IT'S GOING TO TAKE TEN MILLION DOLLARS OF EQUIPMENT WE REALIZE THAT YOU HAVE TO DOUBLE YOUR RATES TO PAY FOR THAT WHICH IS A SITUATION THAT THEY'RE IN. A HERE WE'RE GOING TO GIVE YOU A GRANT TO SOLVE YOUR PROBLEM I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE THAT HAPPEN BUT WE CAN'T BLAME THE DISTRICT FOR THAT IT'S NOT THEIR MISMANAGEMENT THE CAUSE THAT TO HAPPEN. YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S NATURALLY OCCURRING IN ITS RESULT OF US LOWERING THE STANDARDS SO -- YOU KNOW THAT THAT'S MY CONCERN AND I REALLY WISH THAT THAT PART WAS NOT IN THE VALUATION CALCULATIONS. TO VERY GOOD OUR OTHER QUESTIONS. ALL RIGHT MùT IT'S BEEN MOVED AND SECONDED A FIRST I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR BRINGING UP A LOT OF ISSUES AND QUESTIONS AND THAT'S WHY WE HAVE VERY. SO THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH -- SENATOR DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING IN ADDITION TO SAY ISSUE CLOSE I THINK I THINK I PRETTY MUCH HIT EVERYTHING I AM. LET ME JUST SAY THAT THAT I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH THE WITH THE OPPOSITION -- WE'VE HAD SOME SOME GOOD CONVERSATIONS -- AND MY MY GOAL IS TO BE ABLE TO GO BACK TO THESE -- FAMILIES THAT I'VE COME TO KNOW VERY WELL WHO ARE -- WHO REALLY ARE ARE LIVING IN -- LIVING IN THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE READ THAT THEY TURN ON THE WATER FAUCET AND NOT BE ABLE TO BE THERE TO DRINK IT. AND I WANT TO BE ABLE TO GO BACK TO THEM AND SAY WE HAVE SOME SOLUTIONS HERE AND THAT'S THE REASON WE'VE BEEN WORKING SO HARD ON THIS BILL SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- AGAIN THIS BILL GOES NEXT -- TO A LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND THEN APPROPRIATIONS SO IF PEOPLE HAVE ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS SUGGESTIONS PLEASE BRING THEM TO THE SENATOR. AND HER STAFF -- I AM GOING TO URGE AND I VOTE -- MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. THIS IS THIS IS ITEM NUMBER FOUR SB FOUR FOURTEEN GUY AT ALL.

OKAY I JUST WANT TO MENTION THAT THE REASON THE MEMBERS TO THE BELL REMOVE ITS JURISDICTION FROM THE ASSEMBLY GOVERNMENT. ORGANIZATION COMMITTEE THERE FOR GOES TO ASSEMBLY APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE AFTER THIS COMMITTEE SAU. A SENATOR PLEASE PROCEED. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS -- I'M HERE TO PRESENT ON SB. FIVE ONE THREE WHICH WILL HELP INSURE WATER TANKS REMAIN AVAILABLE FOR FAMILIES WHO ARE WITHOUT DRINKING WATER AS A RESULT OF A TRY WELL. IN CALIFORNIA OVER TWELVE HUNDRED FAMILIES HAVE NEEDED EMERGENCY WATER TANKS AS A RESULT OF CALIFORNIA'S HISTORIC DROUGHT. A COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS LIKE SELF HELP ENTERPRISES OFFER ASSISTANCETO FAMILIES IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY BY INSTALLING WATER TANKS. AS A TEMPORARY SOLUTION UNTIL GROUND WATER IN THE WELLS. RECHARGES OR UNTIL. A MORE PERMANENT SOLUTION OCCURS AS YOU ALTHOUGH GROUND WATER MOVES MUCH MORE SLOWLY THAN SURFACE WATER. AND IT TAKES TIME FOR GROUND WATER RECHARGE OF WELLS TO OCCUR. HOWEVER ALTHOUGH THE DROUGHT WAS DECLARED OVER IN APRIL TWENTY SEVENTEEN WATER SHORT SHORTAGE IS A CHRONIC SYMPTOM IN MY DISTRICT AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY. AND MANY FAMILIES WHO WENT DRY AFTER APRIL TWENTY SEVEN SEVENTEEN DID NOT QUALIFY FOR TEMPORARY WATER TANKS. THIS MEANS THAT MANY FAMILIES IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY WHO RELY ON WELLS FOR THEIR DRINKING. WATER ARE STILL IN NEED OF INTERMARRIAGE TANKS EVEN OF THE TRIBE HAS BEEN DECLARED OVER. SB FIVE THIRTEEN CODIFIES THAT FUNDING FOR WATER TANKS ARE AVAILABLE FOR ANY HOME IMPACTED BY TRY WELL OR DROUGHT IT CLARIFIES THAT STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD. MAY SOON PROVIDING FUNDING FOR WATER TANKS FOR HOMES WITH DRY WELLS OUTSIDE OF AN EMERGENCY. DROUGHT DECLARATION. THIS BILL ALSO CONFORMS TO TWO POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ALLOCATED FOR WATER TANKS AND INTERNALLY FOR MEASURES IN AB. SEVENTY FOUR OUR BUDGET BILL RECENTLY SIGNED BY GOVERNOR YOU SAM. UP WITHOUT THIRTY IN THE LAW THAT ALLOWS THIS PROGRAM TO ALLOCATE FUNDS TO HOMES OUTSIDE OF EMERGENCY SITUATIONS. COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS WILL REMAIN UNABLE TO OFFER FAMILIES THE COMFORT OF CLEAN AND SAFE WATER. THROUGH THESE AND FROM WATER TANKS ARE WITH ME TODAY I HAVE TAMMY MCVEIGH WITH SELF HELP ENTERPRISES. UP WE HAVE FOUR MINUTES FOR EACH SIDE -- FOR OPPOSITION IN SUPPORT PLEASE GO AHEAD. OKAY THANK YOU AB. MY NAME IS TAMMY MCVEIGH WITH SELF HELP ENTERPRISES AND I JUST WANT TO THINK CENTER HER DAUGHTER AND HER STAFF AND JUST BEING OUR CHAMPION AND LOOKING OUT FOR THESE RESIDENTS AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY WE CURRENTLY HAVE. ALMOST A HUNDRED FOLKS WITH OUR HOMES WITHOUT WATER RIGHT NOW AND WE ARE WORKING DILIGENTLY TO TRY AND PROVIDE THEM. EMERGENCY TANKS SO THESE FUNDS WOULD ASSIST US I THINK RIGHT NOW WE HAVE ABOUT A MILLION DOLLARS TO SERVE THOSE HUNDRED PEOPLE. AND SO ANY ADDITIONAL FUNDS WOULD. REALLY WORK FOR THEM AT SO ON BEHALF OF SELF HELP WE DO SUPPORT THIS BILL. I ALSO WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU GUYS THIS STORY -- AND TESTIMONY OF ONE OF OUR PARTICIPANTS. DO I HAVE A SECOND.

MRS BUT LANCE EXPLAINED HOW SHE HAD APPLIED MULTIPLE FOR MULTIPLE PERSONAL CREDIT CARDS AND HAD MAXED THEM ALL OUT JUST TO HAVE WATER BROUGHT TO HER HOME. FOR HER AND HER SON. THIS REQUIRED -- MISS LANCE ALSO LIVED IN MOBILE HOME IN RIDGECREST. AND SO SHE ONLY HAD SOME SO SORRY SHE ONLY HAD A SWAMP COOLER. AND SO SHE REQUIRED EXTRA WATER JUST TO KEEP THE HOME QUOTE. MY STAFF AND I WORKED DILIGENTLY TO TRY AND GET HER. APPLICATION MOVE FORWARD BUT WITH A LOT OF PROGRAMS THERE'S A LOT OF DOCUMENTATION IT'S REQUIRED SO IT DID TAKE SOME TIME. THIS BILL AND HAD TO RELY ON OTHERS IN ORDER TO GO GET THE DOCUMENTS THAT SHE NEEDED -- BY MARCH WE HAD RECEIVED EVERYTHING AND HAD AN APPROVAL THINK YOU. HAD AN APPROVAL YOU. NICE. TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THE DRILLING OF A NEW WELL DURING THIS TIME MISTER LANCE CHOSE TO USE HER FUNDS. FOR WATER INSTEAD OF HEALTH CARE. UNFORTUNATELY FOR MISS BLACK AND HER SON THE DECISION CAME IN A REALLY HIGH COST. IN A MYTH WILL HAVE PASSED AWAY DUE TO AN MATH HEALTHCARE NEEDS.

SO YEAH A AND YOU'VE WORKED VERY HARD ON THIS BILL OF THE TITLE IS COSMETIC FRAGRANCE AND FLAVOR INGREDIENTS RIGHT TO KNOW ACT OF TWENTY NINETEEN THANK YOU FOR ALL YOUR HARD WORK ON THIS YOU ARE WELCOME THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP MISTER CHAIR AND YOUR STAFF% WE GREATLY. APPRECIATE IT. AND YOU KNOW THE BEST LAID PLANS I WAS THE FIRST PERSON SIGNED IN TO GO FIRST AND IT JUST DIDN'T WORK OUT QUITE THAT WAY -- BUT GLAD TO BE HERE. I'M PLEASE THE FOLLOWING SEVERAL MONTHS OF GOOD FAITH NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE BILL'S SPONSORS AND INDUSTRY WE REACHED A COMPROMISE AND THE LEAD INDUSTRY ORGANIZATIONS HAVE MOVED TO A NEUTRAL POSITION AS YOU ALL KNOW SOMETIMES THAT IS NO SMALL FEAT. MEMBERS OF FIVE SEVEN FOUR IS A BALANCED MEASURE THAT EMPOWERS CONSUMERS PROVIDES APPROPRIATE BUSINESS PROTECTIONS AND ADVANCES PUBLIC HEALTH. SPECIFICALLY SB FIVE SEVENTY FOUR REQUIRES THE DISCLOSURE OF FRAGRANCE AND FLAVOR INGREDIENTS AND PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS THAT APPEAR ON DESIGNATED AN AUTHORITATIVE HAUSER CHEMICAL LIST. TO THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH THE P. H.. THIS BILL DOES NOT BAN ANY PRODUCT IN GREEN ORREQUIRE ADDITIONAL PRODUCT LABELING. I JUST CAN'T WAIT. I SAID OKAY. SB FIVE SOME FOUR ALSO PROTECTS TRADE SECRETS INCLUDING PRODUCT INGREDIENT FORMULAS SO THAT WE ARE PROTECTING VALUABLE RECIPES AND FORMULATIONS. MEMBERS IN CALIFORNIA TODAY THE PUBLIC KNOWS MORE ABOUT THE FRAGRANCE IGGY GRADIENTS AND CLEANING PRODUCTS THAN THOSE THAT WE USE TO CLEAN AND SENT OUR BODIES PUT ANOTHER WAY WE ACTUALLY KNOW MORE ABOUT THE FRAGRANCES IN FLOOR CLEANERS. DISINFECTANTS THAN WE DO IN SHAMPOOS DEODORANTS AND BODY SPRAYS WE ALSO KNOW VERY LITTLE ABOUT THE FLAVORS IN CHAP STICKS MOUTHWASH AND LIP GLOSSES AND I FORGOT MY LITTLE STRAWBERRY FIZZ LIP GLOSS THAT I USUALLY BRING AND I LEFT IT ON MY DESK BUT I WOULD LOVE TO KNOW. WHAT MAKES STRAWBERRY PHYS STRAWBERRY FEST? CURRENTLY NO STATE OR FEDERAL LAW REQUIRES A DISCLOSURE OF FRAGRANCE OR FLAVOR INGREDIENTS TO CONSUMERS OR REGULATORY AGENCIES NOT EVEN THE FDA. THIS LOOPHOLE ALLOWS CHEMICALS TO HIDE UNDER THE WORD FRAGRANCE OR FLAVOR ON THE LABELS OF BEAUTY AND PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS WITH LITTLE REGULATORY OVERSIGHT. OF THE SAFETY OF THOSE INGREDIENTS YOU COULD SEE FOR YOURSELF ON THE LABELS OF THE PRODUCTS THAT YOU USE EVERY MORNING AND NIGHT. THOUSANDS OF CHEMICALS ARE USED TO CREATE THE FRAGRANCES AND FLAVORS THE COMPRISED THE BEAUTY AND PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS WE USE EVERY DAY. SOME OF THESE CHEMICALS HAVE BEEN LINKED TO NEGATIVE HEALTH IMPACTS RANGING FROM ALLERGIC REACTIONS TO REPRODUCTIVE HARM AN INCREASED RISK OF BREAST CANCER. SB FIVE SEVENTY FOUR ONE POWER CONSUMERS TO MAKE EDUCATED DECISIONS ABOUT WHICH PRODUCTS TO USE WITH THEIR KIDS AND THEIR FAMILIES. WITH THIS BILL WE ARE RECOGNIZING THAT CONSUMERS AND WORKERS HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW WHAT INGREDIENTS ARE IN THE PRODUCTS THEY INTERACT WITH THAT WORK AND BRING HOME TO THEIR FAMILIES. SB FIVE SEVENTY FOUR ONE SURE THAT CALIFORNIA CONTINUES TO BE A NATIONAL AND GLOBAL LEADER ON PUBLIC HEALTH. THIS BILL IS BROADLY SUPPORTED BY LABOR PUBLIC HEALTH ENVIRONMENTAL MULTI ETHNIC AND CANCER PREVENT. PREVENTION ORGANIZATIONS IS IT ALL IT IS ALSO SUPPORTED BY DOZENS OF BUSINESSES THAT ARE FINDING MUCH SUCCESS IN DISCLOSING FRAGRANCE AND FLAVOR INGREDIENTS INCLUDING. PROCTER AND GAMBLE THE WORLD'S LARGEST CONSUMER PRODUCTS COMPANY AND UNILEVER THE SECOND LARGEST BEAUTY AND PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS COMPANY IN THE WORLD. HERE WITH ME IN SUPPORT IS SUSAN BLACK C. E. O. OF ECO PRODUCTS IN JANET NEWMAN DIRECTOR PROGRAM AND POLICY FOR BREAST CANCER PREVENTION PARTNERS. AND IS AVAILABLE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS. ALL RIGHTS YOU HAVE FOUR MINUTES PLEASE SAID TRY TO IT TWO MINUTES EACH SOUND ABOUT RIGHT YES. TAKE THE WHOLE FOR OKAY THAT'S FINE DO THAT. GOOD AFTERNOON A DOCTOR QUIRK IN MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY YES TM COMMITTEE. I'M SUSAN GRIFFIN BLACK I'M THE FOUNDER AND CO CEO OF E. -- PRODUCTS SINCE. NINETEEN NINETY FIVE WITH A STAFF OF TEN PEOPLE WE BEGAN MAKING BOTANICALLY BASED BATH AND BODY CARE PRODUCTS. IN A SMALL SPACE IN THE BAY AREA. TODAY WE ARE HUNDRED AND FIFTY STRONG. HAVE TWO BRANDS ONE IS EASY -- THE OTHER EVERYONE. AND YOU CAN FIND OUR PRODUCTS IN TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND POINTS OF DISTRIBUTION IN THE USA. WE ARE MAKERS WE CARE VERY DEEPLY ABOUT THE QUALITY AND SAFETY OF OUR INGREDIENTS AND HOW THEIR SOURCED. WE CARE DEEPLY ABOUT THE HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF EACH OTHER. AND OF OUR CUSTOMERS ONE OF THE THINGS WE'VE HEARD MOST OVER THE YEARS IS THAT WE HAVE THE BEST SMELLING PRODUCTS IN THE MARKET PLACE. SINCE THE BEGINNING OF OUR COMPANY WE PROVIDED FULL GRADIENT DISCLOSURE ON FRAGRANCE FLAVORS AND EVERY OTHER THING THAT GOES INTO MAKING OUR PRODUCTS. WITHOUT A MARKETING DEPARTMENT UNTIL ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO. AND WITHOUT OUTSIDE FINANCING INSTITUTIONAL FINANCING WE SUCCESSFULLY BUILT A COMPANY WHOSE REVENUE WAS FIFTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND WE'VE GROWN 20% YEAR OVER YEAR. ONE OF THE REASONS FOR OUR SUCCESS IS THAT WE'VE BEEN CUT WE'VE BECOME AND WE'VE ALWAYS BEEN AN ADVOCATE. FOR INGREDIENT TRANSPARENCY TO GIVE OUR CUSTOMERS THE ABILITY TO MAKE HEALTHIER CHOICES FOR THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES. OUR CUSTOMERS TRUST US AND WE VALUE EACH AND EVERYONE OF THEM. I'M HERE TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF SB. FIVE SEVENTY FOUR AND AS SENATOR LEAVE US SAID. FRAGRANCE AND FLAVOR CHEMICALS ARE USED IN THE MAJORITY OF PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS. YET THESE INGREDIENTS ARE HIDDEN FROM PUBLIC VIEW BECAUSE NO FEDERAL LAW REQUIRES THE DISCLOSURE OF ANY OF THESE FRAGRANCE AND FLAVOR INGREDIENTS. TO CONSUMERS MANUFACTURERS AND EVEN REGULATORY AGENCIES. THIS LABELING LOOPHOLE ALLOWS CHEMICALS LINKED TO HARM AND HUMAN IT TELL TO HARM HUMAN HEALTH. AND THE ENVIRONMENT. HENCE THE CONVERSATION THAT. CAME BEFORE THIS ONE IT'S ALL VERY INTER DEPENDENT YOU KNOW THESE CHEMICALS MAKE THEIR WAY INTO OUR WATER SYSTEMS AND THEY AFFECT EACH AND EVERYONE OF US IN IN MANY WAYS. ANYWAY THEY THEY ARE ABLE TO BE HIDDEN UNDER THE WORD FRAGRANCE OR FLAVOR WITHOUT REGULATORY IN OVERSIGHT. OF THE SAFETY OF THESE INGREDIENTS. IN ADDITION TO CHRONIC HEALTH CONCERNS RESEARCH SHOWS THAT UP SUFFERS FROM FRAGRANCE ALLERGIES TRANSLATING TO HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY THE LACK OF INGREDIENT. DISCLOSURE [inaudible] FORTUNATELY. THE SAFE AND CLEAN BEAUTY COMPANIES LIKE OURS REPRESENT THE FASTEST GROWING SEGMENT OF THE PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS MARKET. ESTIMATED TO GENERATE OVER TWENTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS. BY. TWENTY TWENTY FIVE WHY IS THIS TRUE. BECAUSE PEOPLE WANT TO KNOW. THIS IS NOT A TREND THIS IS TRUST PEOPLE VOTE WITH THEIR DOLLARS. THIS RAPID GROWTH IS DUE IN PART TO COMPANIES LIKE OURS WHO RESPONDING TO INCREASING CONSUMER DEMAND FOR INGREDIENT TRANSPARENCY. WE'RE SHOWING IT'S NOT ONLY POSSIBLE BUT PROFITABLE FOR COMPANIES TO BE TRANSPARENT. MORE THAN THAT IT IS SIMPLY THE RIGHT THING TO DO. IT IS A PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY ISSUE. MANY OTHER COMPANIES KEEP THEIR FRAGRANCE AND FLAVOR CHEMICALS HIDDEN FROM PUBLIC VIEW. QUITE SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY CAN. AND IT'S NOT RIGHT AND IT'S NOT FAIR THIS CREATES AN UNLEVEL PLAYING FIELD. WHERE SOME COMPANIES OFFER FULL INGREDIENT TRANSPARENCY AND OTHER COMPANIES ARE ALLOWED TO KEEP IT? A SECRET IT ALSO CREATES A BUYER BEWARE SITUATION FOR CONSUMERS AND WORKERS. HE AND THE THIRTY FIVE SAFE COSMETIC COMPANIES FROM THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. SUPPORTING THIS BILL BELIEVE THAT EVERYONE HAS A RIGHT TO KNOW WHAT HARMFUL INGREDIENTS. EXCUSE ME COULD YOU -- JUST YOU'RE. PEOPLE WANT TO KNOW WHAT IS IN THEIR PRODUCTS THAT THEY USE EVERY DAY. IT. IT IS NOT DIFFICULT TO DO THIS WE'VE BEEN DOING IT FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS. I AM IN FULL SUPPORT AND VERY THANKFUL TO SENATOR LEYVA THANK YOU THANK YOU -- OTHERS IN SUPPORT. TURN MEMBERS NIKITA CROWDED WITH THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL HERE IN SUPPORT. MITCH DYER WITH CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION ALSO IN SUPPORT. EMILY RASH WITH CAL PERK IN SUPPORT. HI LIANE TROUT NOT BEHALF OF BLACK WOMEN FOR WELLNESS AND CALIFORNIA LEAGUE OF CONSERVATION VOTERS IN SUPPORT. PAUL YOU ARE SITTING COUNTY SAN FRANCISCO IN SUPPORT. SUSAN LITTLE WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL WORKING GROUP IN SUPPORT. DEAL RICHTER ON BEHALF OF THE FRIENDS COMMITTEE ON LEGISLATION OF CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. THE SEVENTH FLEET FROM BREAST CANCER PREVENTION PARTNERS ON BEHALF OF THE OTHER. SEVENTY EIGHT GROUPS NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS IN ENVIRONMENT HEALTH WOMEN LABOR ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE AND OTHER GROUPS WHO COULD NOT BE HERE TODAY IN SUPPORT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ALL RIGHT -- QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. I MISSED MURATSUCHI THANK YOU VERY MUCH AS SEVERAL A OF A GRADE BELL I WILL BE SUPPORTING IT. I JUST WANT TO MENTION I HAVE ANOTHER -- TOXIC CHEMICALS IN COSMETICS BILL AND WOULD LOVE TO WORK WITH YOU ON ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU VERY MUCH HILL. MOVED TO APPROVE. ALL RIGHT WE HAVE MOTIONS SECOND. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. MR OBERNOLTE. THANK YOU MISTER I JUST HAD A QUESTION ABOUT LOGISTICS SO THE BILL REQUIRES THAT A MANUFACTURER WHOSE NAME APPEARS ON A LABEL. WOULD MAKE THESE DISCLOSURES IF THEIR PRODUCTS ARE SOLD IN CALIFORNIA SO IF YOU'RE A MANUFACTURER OF WHAT WAS A FIZZY CHAPSTICK -- MY STRAWBERRY FIFTH STRAWBERRY FOR THIS OKAY IN IN FLORIDA. AND YOU SOLD A BUNCH TO A DISTRIBUTOR WHO THEN DISTRIBUTED IN CALIFORNIA HOW WOULD USE THE MANUFACTURE KNOW. THAT YOUR PRODUCTS ARE BEING SOLD IN CALIFORNIA JUST WONDER IF IT'S A REASONABLE REQUIREMENTS YET THE MANUFACTURER MAY NOT NOW BUT IF YOU IF YOU WERE OPERATING IN CALIFORNIA. SO IT'S SATAN SO MY STRAWBERRY -- PHYS IS MADE BY VICTORIA'S SECRET SO IF THEY SELL THE PRODUCT IN ONE STATE AND IT GETS TAKEN CALIFORNIA WHICH WE KNOW THEY ALREADY OPERATE IN CALIFORNIA IT WOULD BE INCUMBENT UPON THE PERSON SELLING IT. TO KNOW THAT THEY HAVE TO ADD THAT TO THE LIST SO THE DISTRIBUTER THE DISTRIBUTER SO BUT IT THE THE BILL DOESN'T SAY THAT THE BILL SAYS THE MANUFACTURERS RESPONSIBLE. AM I WRONG IN THAT THEY CAN GO AHEAD I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER THAT THANK YOU JANET. SO SO THIS BILL AMENDS THE SAFE COSMETICS ACT WHICH CURRENTLY REQUIRES COMPANIES SELLING. COSMETICS WITH PROP SIXTY FIVE CHEMICALS IN THEIR PRODUCTS -- TO CALIFORNIANS TO REPORT THE PRESENCE OF THOSE CHEMICALS TO THE SAFE COSMETICS PROGRAM. AND AND THAT INCLUDES -- BUT WEB BASED SALES SO SO THE COMPANY IN FLORIDA SELLING SENATOR LEAVE US CHAPSTICK. IS REQUIRED TO DISCLOSE THE FRAGRANCE INGREDIENTS IN THEIR PRODUCTS IF THEY APPEAR ON THE DESIGNATED LEST. THE SAME AS A WEB BASED SELLER IN ISRAEL OR ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE WORLD SO THE CITY BECAUSE MEDICS PROGRAM -- ACTUALLY CONDUCTS OUTREACH TO THE COSMETICS INDUSTRY THE FOURTEEN THOUSAND COMPANIES THAT MAKE UP THE COSMETICS INDUSTRY TO INFORM THEM OF THEIR DUTY TO REPORT BUT THERE REGULATORY DIVISIONS WITHIN THOSE COMPANIES. SHOULD BE IT -- DO THE DUE DILIGENCE TO KNOW WHAT LAWS THE REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH IN THE STATES WHERE THEY CONDUCT COMMERCE. OKAY THE I MEAN THAT MIGHT BE TRUE FOR A LARGE COMPANY. BUT I'M I'M THINKING OF A SMALL MANUFACTURE THAT'S MAKING SOMETHING YOUR LOCALLY -- LOCAL PRODUCT IN FLORIDA OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT HI I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT WHAT THEY STILL BECAUSE IF YOU'VE GOT A WEB SALE TO AN ADDRESS IN CALIFORNIA OBVIOUSLY YOU KNOW THAT YOU HAVE SOLD IN CALIFORNIA BUT IF YOU JUST SELL A BUNCH OF THEM A THOUSAND OF THEM TO A DISTRIBUTOR. AND A DISTRIBUTOR GOES OFF AND DOES WHATEVER THEY DO I'M NOT SURE IT'S REASONABLE TO GO BACK AND SAY TO THE MANUFACTURER YOU HAVE BROKEN CALIFORNIA STATE LAW BECAUSE WE'VE DISCOVERED. ONE OF YOUR JERRY FIZZ CHOPSTICKS YOU KNOW IN A STORE IN CALIFORNIA. I DON'T KNOW THAT THE I DON'T KNOW THAT WOULD HAPPEN I DON'T KNOW WHO WOULD ENFORCE THAT WHO WOULD FIND THAT AND SAY THEY DIDN'T FIND THAT THE LIST FIND THE INGREDIENTS ON THE LIST I DON'T KNOW WHO THE ENFORCEMENT AGENCY WOULD BE. JUST TO ADD HERE -- FOR THE AUDIENCE WHO MAY NOT BE FAMILIAR WITH THE BILL WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT ADDING A LABEL ON THE PRODUCT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HAVING IT LISTED. AND SO IT CERTAINLY ANY THE NATIONAL DISTRIBUTORS WILL SIMPLY HAVE IT AND REGARDLESS FOR EXAMPLE OF VICTORIA'S SECRET. SELLS IT IN FLORIDA AND SOMEBODY BUYS IT THERE AND CELLS IN CALIFORNIA EVERYTHING'S TAKEN CARE OF BECAUSE THEY ALREADY HAVE THE DISCLOSURE ON THE WEBSITE. WHAT YOU'RE ASKING OF COURSE IS A MUCH MORE SIMPLE THING LIKE THERE'S AN INDEPENDENT DISTRIBUTOR IN FLORIDA? AND THEY DON'T KNOW THAT THEY HAVE TO PUT IT ON THE WEBSITE AND THEN IT GETS SENT OVER TO CALIFORNIA. I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT -- AND THAT LET'S THINK ABOUT IT -- I THINK YOU HAVE YOU KNOW YOU'VE RAISED AN ISSUE AND CERTAINLY FOR TO MANUFACTURER WHO'S. NOT NATIONAL AND SOMETHING STE WE SHOULD HAVE WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO THINK ABOUT WHAT WE WANT TO DO WITH THAT I THINK IT'S A VALID QUESTION. AND OUT. SHE WILL DO THAT WILL DO THAT. YEAH YOU'RE WELCOME IT'S SOMETIMES I THINK WE DON'T CONTEMPLATE EFFECT ON SMALL BUSINESSES WHO MIGHT NOT HAVE A FULL TIME GROUP PLANS OFFICER. AND IF THAT'S EASY TO DO BECAUSE YOU CAN JUST SET A THRESHOLD OF BY GROSS ANNUAL SALES OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT TO EXAMPLES PEOPLE. ARE GETTING THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT VERY GOOD. AS USUAL YOU RAISE GOOD QUESTIONS BY THE WAY I SHOULD SAY MR OBERNOLTE IS NOT ONLY RAISING GOOD QUESTIONS BUT HE'S A SUBSTITUTE. AND HE HE SEEMS TO KNOW AS MUCH AS ANYONE WHO SERVES ON THIS COMMITTEE INCLUDING ME AND I JUST WANT TO COMPLIMENT YOU FOR DOING YOUR HOMEWORK THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- SHOW NO MORE QUESTIONS I FORGOT TO ASK FOR OPPOSITION. I JUST TOOK THE WORD THAT THERE WASN'T ANY. BUT WE TRY TO BE TRUTHFUL AND HE LEYVA YEAH. ALL RIGHT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE WE HAVE OPPOSITION DID WE JUST GET A MOTION AND A SECOND YES SO. LOOKS LIKE WE CAN CALL THE ROLL. THIS IS ITEM NUMBER SEVEN SB. FIVE SEVENTY FOUR FIVE SEVENTY FOUR LEYVA DO YOU PASS AND RE REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS QUIRK HI QUIRK I MELENDEZ MELENDEZ AYE OBERNOLTE. OBERNOLTE NOT BOLD VOTING ARAMBULA. ARAMBULA I POWER QUE HAN. CRISTINA GARCIA. CRISTINA GARCIA HI HOLDEN MATHIS [inaudible] MATHIS I WHAT A TO G. ACT RIGHT TO CHECK HI. SIX VERY GOOD WE HAVE. SEVEN VOTES YOU'RE OUT AND WILL ALLOW HOLD IT OPEN FOR THE OTHER TWO MEMBERS VERY GOOD THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU MEMBERS -- AGAIN -- I'M SORRY SIX ABOUT. THE BILL AND I'M SORRY WE NEED. TO DO HERE. OKAY OKAY SENATOR WIENER IT'S GREAT TO HAVE YOU HERE PERFECT TIMING. THANK YOU. FOR THERE ARE THIS IS A SB ONE SIXTY SIX PROCESS WATER TREATMENT SYSTEMS BREWERIES. PLEASE PROCEED. WILL THING MICHAEL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF IT'S A GERMAN THANK YOU AND YOUR COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH US ON THIS BILL. AND I'M HAPPY -- TO EXCEPT THE AMENDMENTS TO TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS PROPOSED BY THE COMMITTEE AN ANALYSIS -- SP ONE SIXTY SIX WILL PROVIDE OUR BREWERIES WITH THE OPTION. NOT THE REQUIREMENT BUT THE OPTION -- TO REUSE WATER ON SITE FOR BOTH POTABLE AND NON POTABLE -- PURPOSES WHATEVER THEY CHOOSE -- ALTHOUGH THE DROUGHT -- IS TEMPORARILY OVER WE KNOW THAT UNFORTUNATELY THAT WILL NOT LAST BECAUSE WE HAVE A LONG TERM. STRUCTURAL WATER SHORTAGE IN CALIFORNIA WE BUILT A WATER SYSTEM FOR A MUCH TINIER STATE -- IN OUR STATE OF FORTY MILLION PEOPLE AND THERE IS NOT ENOUGH WATER IN THE LONG RUN AND WE NEED TO DO MORE -- TO BE EFFICIENT -- AND WE ALSO NEED TO CATCH UP. ON WATER REUSE COUNTRIES LIKE AUSTRALIA AND ISRAEL -- THAT -- HAVE A VERY VERY BAD -- PROBLEMS OF WATER HAVE MADE MUCH BETTER USE OF BUT HAVE DONE MUCH MORE WATER USE WE IN CALIFORNIA ARE BEHIND -- WE'RE GETTING BETTER BUT WITH A LOT MORE WORK TO DO. ALL RIGHT NOW -- IT TAKES ON AVERAGE BETWEEN FIVE AND SEVEN GALLONS OF WATER. TO PRODUCE ONE GALLON OF BEER -- BUT WE COULD RE USE THE SO CALLED PROCESS WATER SUCH AS THE WATER USED FOR CLEANING TANKS OR PACKAGING -- AND BY DOING THAT WE CAN CUT THOSE FIGURES AND HALF IN TERMS OF THE AMOUNT OF WATER PER GALLON OF BEER. UNFORTUNATELY THERE ARE CURRENTLY NO UNIFORM HEALTH AND SAFETY STANDARDS FOR ON SITE ONSITE PROCESS WATER. ARE RE USE SOMEONE EVER BREWERY THE SIDE THERE ARE -- BREWERIES THAT ARE WE USING WATER AND THAT'S TERRIFIC INTO DOING THE RIGHT THING. THEY HAVE TO RECREATE THE WHEEL IN TERMS OF THE PERMIT EVERY TIME BECAUSE THERE IS NO STANDARD APPROACH IN TERMS OF GETTING THAT PROMISE. BERMAN. I SAID THIS BILL WILL PROVIDE THAT GUIDANCE AND MAKE IT MORE EFFICIENT AND EASIER. OFFER BREWERIES TO BE ABLE -- TO IMPLEMENT THE SYSTEMS -- ONSITE PROCESS WATER REFUSAL WILL REMAIN COMPLETELY VOLUNTARY UNDER THE BILL. THE GOAL IS SIMPLY TO GIVE BROUGH REEVES A BETTER TOOL -- TO IMPLEMENT WATER USE. AS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE AND WITH ME HERE TODAY. IS UP PAULA KEY HOPE FROM THE SAN FRANCISCO PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. AND MELISSA AND WALKS IN ON BEHALF OF ANHEUSER BUSCH. THANK YOU SENATOR WINNER GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS PAULA KEY HOME THE DIRECTOR OF WATER RESOURCES WITH THE SAN FRANCISCO PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. OF SFPUC PC IS BEEN PROMOTING WATER CONSERVATION FOR MORE THAN TWENTY FIVE YEARS. TODAY OUR RESIDENTIAL PER CAPITA IS FORTY TWO GALLONS PER PERSON PER DAY AMONG THE LOWEST IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. HOWEVER WE RECOGNIZE THERE'S MORE OPPORTUNITIES TO USE WATER EFFICIENTLY. AND AS A SENATOR WIENER MENTIONED THERE'S SIGNIFICANT POTENTIAL -- TO SAVE WATER AND USE WATER EFFICIENTLY IN BREWERIES -- WE'VE HEARD FROM A NUMBER OF BROUGH REASON OUR COMMUNITY -- THAT ARE INTERESTED IN CONSERVING WATER AND RE USING PROCESS WATER ON SITE. AND SO WE RECENTLY DEVELOPED OUR OWN.

GOOD AFTERNOON GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS SEAN HIM WHEN I REPRESENT -- THE CALIFORNIA CRAPPER DISSOCIATION. WE'RE HERE TODAY TO REGISTER SIGNIFICANT CONCERN -- TO THE COMMITTEE REGARDING SENATE BILL. ONE SIXTY SIX OUR CONCERN CENTER RUN THE IMPACT SB ONE SIXTY SIX WILL HAVE ON THE NINE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY CRAFT VERSION STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AS WRITTEN SB ONE SIXTY SIX APPEARS TO REQUIRE THE STATE'S NINE HUNDRED EIGHTY CRAFT BREWS TO REGISTER WITH C. WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT. A PUBLIC HEALTH AT A COST OF TWELVE HUNDRED DOLLARS PER YEAR PER BREWERY. AS THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS STATES THERE IS ALREADY CONFUSION OVER THE NECESSITY OF CV PH REQUIREMENTS. WE REALLY REALLY WE FEEL VERY STRONGLY THIS SEEMS TO BE RESOLVED BEFORE THIS BILL MOVES TO THE ASSEMBLY. FOR ARM BEFORE IT'S CONSIDERED BY THE ENTIRE LEGISLATURE -- WE ALSO INTRODUCED AB SEVEN FORTY SIX EARLIER THIS YEAR EXCUSE ME WE SPONSORED WAS INTRODUCED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER JIM WOOD A TO ADDRESS THIS CONFUSION BY EXEMPTING BREWERIES FROM HAVING TO REGISTER. AS FOOD PROCESSORS ON THIS WOULD BRING BREEZE IN PARITY WITH WINERIES IN CALIFORNIA THEY ARE EXIT CURRENTLY EXEMPTED FROM FROM THIS REQUIREMENT. THIS REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS IN THIS FEE ON AN ANNUAL BASIS SO WE WERE SEEKING TO FIX THIS PROBLEM -- AND WE RAN INTO A SITUATION WHERE THERE IS A CONFLICTING MEASURE ON FOR THAT KIND OF WAS GOING. TO PUSH IT OUT A LITTLE BIT FURTHER -- SO WE JUST. FEEL LIKE WE NEED A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME TO REMOVE THESE THE CV PH REQUIREMENT ON CRAFT BREWERIES [inaudible] WORD. STRONGLY STRONGLY SUPPORTIVE OF THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES BEING THE ONE THE DRESSES REGULATIONS AND FORCES REGULATION SO. WAS MY COMMENTS TODAY AND REALLY REALLY REALLY ONE OF WITH THIS COMPANY DOLLAR FEE. FOR THAT'S LAVAN THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER WINNER -- FOR SO WE HAVEN'T RECEIVED A LETTER FROM YOU. NOW WE HAVEN'T RECEIVED A LETTER WOULD YOU MIND AS SUBMITTING ONE SO THAT THE DOCTOR CAN TAKE A LOOK AT YOUR CONCERN CERTAINLY AND WE WERE AWARE OF THAT WE APOLOGIZE FOR NOT GETTING HAVING THE TIME TO GET THAT LETTER ANTI. OKAY THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT OUR OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. NO OTHERS IN OPPOSITION -- LET'S SEE THEN WE WOULD ASK FOR QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. THE THANK YOU A SENATOR WIENER APPRECIATE. THE WORK YOU'RE DOING -- IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN I TRIED TO WORK ON THE IDEA OF FREE CYCLE WATER FOR BEER AFTER A TRIP TO US REALLY A I I IT DIDN'T GO ANYWHERE BUT I'M HAPPY THAT THE DISCUSSION IS BACK IN IN A DIFFERENT FORM -- AND WE'RE HAVING THAT DISCUSSION -- AND SO I WILL BE SUPPORTIVE OF YOUR BILL EXCITED I WAS EXCITED TO SEE THIS WHEN I GOT A BRIEF THIS THIS MORNING BY MY STAFF I WOULD LIKE TO BE ADDED ON AS A CO AUTHOR. BUT I DO HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT -- THE OPPOSITION AND WHILE WE DON'T HAVE A LETTER HAVE YOU HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK INTO THIS FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR FEE ISSUE AT ALL. YET SO ON I THANK YOU AND WE WOULD LOVE TO HAVE YOU AS A CO AUTHOR -- I WAS AWARE OF YOUR WORK WE REALLY APPRECIATE THAT ASSEMBLYMEMBER. ON THE FORGET THE SPECIFIC ISSUE I JUST WANT TO SPEAK GENERALLY WE HAVE BEEN ATTEMPTING TO WORK WITH THE CRAFT BREWERS THE ENTIRE YEAR -- MY STAFF HAS PUT ON ENDING TIME AND ENERGY INTO TRYING TO WORK WITH THE CRAFT BREWERS. AND IT IS CHAT WE JUST KEEP HITTING WALLS YOU'LL NOTICE THAT -- ANCHOR -- BREWERY IS A IS A SUPPORTER OF THE BILL WE HAVE -- I'VE SPOKEN WITH INDIVIDUAL CRAFT BREWERS WHO ARE VERY SUPPORTIVE BUT THE ASSOCIATION HAS ON OFFICE BE BLUNT BEEN EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO WORK WITH ME MADE CHANGES TO THE BILL WE TOLD WE EVEN REDUCE THE BILL TO A SPOT BILL. TO GET OUT OF THE SENATE AS A SIGN OF GOOD FAITH TO SAY WE WERE REDUCE IT -- TO A SPOT BILL WORK WITH YOU IN THE RE EXPANDED OUT AND WE WERE JUST UNABLE -- TO REALLY EFFECTIVELY WORK WITH THE ASSOCIATION I HOPE THAT THAT CHANGES I WANT TO BE ABLE TO WORK WITH THEM ON THIS. ON THIS BILL WILL WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THE MEMBERS OF THE INDUSTRY LIKE ANHEUSER BUSCH LIKE ANCHOR WHO'VE BEEN ARE WILLING TO WORK WITH US. THIS BILL DOES NOT REQUIRE REGISTRATION THE BILL APPLIES TO BREWERIES THAT ARE REGISTERED THIS BILL DOES NOT MANDATE THAT ANYONE REGISTER WITH CD PH. I'M AWARE OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOODS BILL -- WHICH I SUPPORT -- SO THAT THEY ARE NO LONGER CONSIDERED FOOD PROCESSORS -- AND AS THAT WE INDICATE THE CROPPERS EARLIER THIS WEEK WERE HAPPY TO WORK TO TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT I DON'T WANT THIS BILL TO IN ANY WAY COMPLEX WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOODS. BILL SO WE'RE COMMITTED TO MAKING SURE TO HARMONIZE A BECAUSE I AM SUPPORTIVE OF WHAT HE'S DOING. CONTROL PLAYERS WILL COME TO THE TABLE. TO FIND A SOLUTION BEFORE IT DOES HIT THE FLOOR I UNDERSTAND A CRAFT. BREWER HAS VERY DIFFERENT CONSTRAINTS THAT UNANSWERED BUSH OR EVEN AN ANCHOR THAT IS SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDDLE. OF THAT AND SO TWELVE HUNDRED DOLLARS A IS A PRETTY SIZEABLE DOLLAR AMOUNTS AND SO I DO APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S COMMITMENT TO WORK WITH YOU GUYS -- IN THE NEAR FUTURE TO FIND A SUITABLE SOLUTION FOR EVERYBODY. CERTAINLY AND AND MANY OF OUR MEMBERS -- ACTUALLY HAVE THE SYSTEMS IN OPERATION. SIERRA NEVADA BRING COMPANY BEING PROBABLY ONE OF THE LARGEST -- OUR ON SITE. TREATMENT SYSTEMS RUSSIAN RIVER BRING COMPANY THEY JUST BUILT THEIR BEAUTIFUL GIANT NEW VERY IN WINDSOR CALIFORNIA THEY HAVE ONE OF THE SYSTEMS BUT AND BY COMPANY NAME CAME RENOVATION. REPUBLIC BRING COMPANY SEISMIC BRING COMPANY STONE BRING OF ANY WE HAVE MANY MEMBERS I CAN DO THIS. MOST OF THEM ARE WELL ESTABLISHED BUSINESS SO WHEN WE SEE THE TWELVE HUNDRED DOLLAR FEE THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH WHICH IS. OF CONCERN IN THE COMMITTEES ANALYSIS WE JUST REALLY WANT TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE THE TIME TO CLEAR THAT UP TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT ISN'T THE CASE. THESE THINGS ARE HARD TO PUT BACK IN THE BOTTLE NO PUN INTENDED. ONCE THEY THEY GET A MOVE PASSED THE FOUR OF THE PERCEIVED GOVERNMENT SIGNATURE. ON AND AND WE REALLY DO HOPE TO WORK ON THIS BILL WITH THE AUTHOR YEAH. AND DAT JUST IT IS THE AND THEN MY COMMITTEE -- STAFF WILL MAKE SURE I'M CORRECT ABOUT THIS. NO ONE WHO IS ACCUSED ME IF A BREWERIES NOT RECYCLING WATER THEY CERTAINLY DO NOT HAVE TO PAY THE TWELVE HUNDRED DOLLAR FEE. IT'S ONLY THOSE THAT ARE DOING THE RECYCLING THAT PERHAPS UNDER THIS BILL WOULD HAVE TO AND YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE SURE -- SENATOR THAT THAT'S THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TO PAY THAT IS THAT CORRECT UNDER EXISTING LAW WE WITH THIS BILL DOES NOT MANDATE THAT THEY REGISTER OR PAY THE FEE -- THEY THEY WERE AND WHAT BUT WHATEVER NEEDS TO BE WORKED OUT AROUND CD PH BECAUSE LIKE I SAID I DO SUPPORT. A SUMMER WHAT'S BILL TO TRY TO GET CITY PH. OUT OF THAT IN TERMS OF CLASSIFICATIONS FOOD PROCESSORS -- AND SO WE WILL WORK WITH THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO ATTEMPT TO WORK WITH THE ASSOCIATION. TO RESOLVE -- THIS AND ANY OTHER ISSUE THAT WE CAN RESULT CURRENT SO THEN TO SUMMARIZE IF ASSEMBLY MEMBER. WOODS BILL IS PASSED. AND REACHES THE ARE GOVERNOR'S DESK AND OUR IS SIGNED. THEN IT WOULD BE VERY CLEAR THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TO PAY THE TWELVE HUNDRED DOLLARS PERIOD WHETHER THEY RECYCLE WATER OR NOT. IS THAT CORRECT. THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING OF THEIR STAFF IS. MAKING UP AHEAD GESTURE. THE PERHAPS STAFF YOU COULD SAY SOMETHING DIRECTLY. IT SURE SHOULD AB SEVENTY FORTY SEVEN FORTY SIX PASS. AS CURRENTLY WRITTEN. WE ARE PROCESSING WOULD BE EXEMPT FROM THE SHERMAN FOR DRUG COSMETIC ACT THEREBY ELIMINATING. YOUR PROCESSING FROM CBS'S PURVIEW SO THIS IS YOUR BILL SENATOR WIENER WOULD REQUIRE. ONLY MAKE THOSE BREWERIES THAT ARE LICENSED BY C. PH ELIGIBLE TO USE THE WATER RECYCLING. AS THE BILL AS DRAFTED SO I THINK I THINK THAT CAN BE RECONCILED. AM I JUST AMENDMENTS NEED TO BE WORKED OUT BETWEEN THE TWO BILLS YES AND WE ARE AND BECAUSE OUR BILL WAS DRAFTED BASED ON THE CURRENT LAW -- OBVIOUSLY ASSEMBLY MEMBER WHAT'S BILL IS MOVING ALONG PARALLEL TO OURS -- BUT WE WERE GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT OURS IS HARMONIZED WITH WHAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOOD IS DOING SO I DON'T THINK WE HAVE ANY DISAGREEMENT WITH THE ASSOCIATION ON ALL RIGHT SO I HAVE A QUESTION WHICH IS. IF YOU'RE GONNA USE RECYCLE WATER AND GET EVERYTHING DONE THE WAY IT'S JUST SAD. THEN WITH A COMPANY USING RECYCLED WATER HAVE TO PAY A TWELVE HUNDRED DOLLAR ANNUAL FEE. WITH THE WORDS BILL NOW. WHICH BILL NO SELF THAT PASSES. THEN IT IS VERY CLEAR THEY WILL NOT BE A FEE. THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING. AND IS THAT YOUR UNDERSTANDING AS WELL MY TECHNICAL EXPERTS RIGHT CENTER WINTERS BILL WOULD NOT IMPOSE A FEED IT WOULD NOT REQUIRE LICENSE JR. BUT THE BILL WOULD JUST NEED TO BE CORRECTED TO CLARIFY THAT THE AN ELIGIBLE BREWERY COULD USE THE ONSITE PROCESS WATER. WITHOUT HAVING TO BE LICENSED SO JUST CLARIFYING THE PURVIEW OF THE TWO STATE AND AND WE INTEND TO DO THAT. ALL RIGHT SELL IT IS CLEAR THE AMENDMENT THAT HAS TO BE TAKEN. ARM AND WE HAVE TO MAKE. SO I WILL GIVE YOU THE OPTION OF PERHAPS DOUBLE JOIN YOUR BILL WITH MR WORDS BECAUSE THEN IT WOULD BE VERY CLEAR THAT THEY BOTH HAVE TO PASS. AND TOGETHER WITH AN AMENDMENT IT WOULD BE VERY CLEAR THAT THEY WON'T HAVE TO PAY THAT FEE I KNOW THAT'S A BIG ASK BUT THAT'S A POSSIBILITY. I WOULD PREFER NOT. TO PLACE A LINK THE TWO BUT I'M REPRESENTING TO THE COMMITTEE THAT WE'RE GOING TO HARMONIZE OUR BILL WITH MR ALRIGHT LET YOU WILL FIND A WAY. WE WILL OUT ALL RIGHT THAT'S ONLY ONE OPTION THERE COULD BE ETHICS ALL RIGHT. ARM AND I WILL. TELL THE COMMITTEE THAT WE WILL FOLLOW THE BILL AND WORK WITH THE AUTHOR TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT HAPPENS WE WILL USE OUR EXPERTISE. AND MAKE SURE THAT YOUR CONCERNS ARE MATT -- THANK YOU.
