ALL HEARD OVER AND OVER AGAIN

ON THIS FLOOR THAT

01:04:37.206 --> 01:04:39.141
TRANSPORTATION IS THE ONE AREA

01:04:39.208 --> 01:04:40.643
IN CALIFORNIA WILL BE GONE IN

01:04:40.710 --> 01:04:41.677
THE WRONG DIRECTION IN TERMS OF

01:04:41.744 --> 01:04:44.046
GREENHOUSE GASES IT'S ALSO THE

01:04:44.113 --> 01:04:45.114
ONE AREA WHERE WE'VE GOT IN THE

01:04:45.181 --> 01:04:46.816
WRONG DIRECTION IN TERMS OF

01:04:46.882 --> 01:04:48.985
CONGESTION. WITH AREAS LIKE I

01:04:49.051 --> 01:04:50.953
LIVE IN LOS ANGELES HAVING SO

01:04:51.020 --> 01:04:52.855
MUCH CONGESTION THAT SOMETIMES

01:04:52.922 --> 01:04:53.923
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO GET AROUND

01:04:53.990 --> 01:04:55.992
AND FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE LIVING

01:04:56.058 --> 01:04:56.592
FURTHER AND FURTHER AWAY FROM

01:04:56.659 --> 01:04:57.793
WHERE THEY WORK IT BECOMES

01:04:57.860 --> 01:05:00.429
EXTREMELY PUNITIVE AN IMPACT ON

01:05:00.496 --> 01:05:02.198
THE QUALITY OF LIFE. IT'S ALSO

01:05:02.265 --> 01:05:03.833
A REASON PARKING IS ALSO IN

01:05:03.899 --> 01:05:05.368
CARS ARE ALSO ONE OF THE

01:05:05.434 --> 01:05:06.669
PRIMARY REASONS WHY IT'S

01:05:06.736 --> 01:05:08.337
DIFFICULT. TO BUILD HOUSING IN

01:05:08.404 --> 01:05:09.905
LOS ANGELES. I KNOW FOR MY

01:05:09.972 --> 01:05:11.274
YEARS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT THAT

01:05:11.340 --> 01:05:12.441
WHEN YOU GO TO BILL HOUSING

01:05:12.508 --> 01:05:14.243
REALLY OF ANY SCALE. THE FIRST

01:05:14.310 --> 01:05:14.910
THING PEOPLE IN THE

01:05:14.977 --> 01:05:16.846
NEIGHBORHOOD SAY IS. WE DON'T

01:05:16.912 --> 01:05:17.546
WANT THIS HOUSING PROJECT

01:05:17.613 --> 01:05:19.915
BECAUSE OF THE- CONGESTION

01:05:19.982 --> 01:05:23.286
BECAUSE OF THE PARKING IMPACTS.

01:05:23.352 --> 01:05:24.854
WE ALSO KNOW THAT ONE OF OUR

01:05:24.920 --> 01:05:26.422
GOALS TO SOLVE ALL OF THIS HAS

01:05:26.489 --> 01:05:28.024
BEEN TO TRY TO REDUCE VEHICLE

01:05:28.090 --> 01:05:30.826
MILES TRAVELED. AND YET WE

01:05:30.893 --> 01:05:32.662
CONTINUE. CONTINUE TO

01:05:32.728 --> 01:05:35.731
PRIORITIZE. PARKING IN CARS

01:05:35.798 --> 01:05:36.666
EVEN AT THE EXPENSE OF HUMAN

01:05:36.732 --> 01:05:39.702
BEINGS. IN THE UNITED STATES WE

01:05:39.769 --> 01:05:41.904
DEDICATE APPROXIMATELY A

01:05:41.971 --> 01:05:44.040
THOUSAND SQUARE FEET OF LAND

01:05:44.106 --> 01:05:44.840
FOR EVERY CAR THAT WE HAVE IN

01:05:44.907 --> 01:05:47.443
THE COUNTRY. AT THE SAME TIME

01:05:47.510 --> 01:05:48.978
WE DEDICATE ONLY EIGHT HUNDRED

01:05:49.045 --> 01:05:51.047
SQUARE FEET OF HOUSING FOR

01:05:51.113 --> 01:05:51.614
EVERY PERSON WE HAVE IN THE

01:05:51.681 --> 01:05:53.516
COUNTRY. THERE ARE SOME REALLY

01:05:53.582 --> 01:05:55.284
ASTOUNDING FACTS IN LOS ANGELES

01:05:55.351 --> 01:05:56.986
COUNTY PARKING MANDATES HAVE

01:05:57.053 --> 01:05:59.422
LED TO AN ASTONISHING TWO

01:05:59.488 --> 01:06:01.123
HUNDRED SQUARE MILES JUST OF

01:06:01.190 --> 01:06:03.059
PARKING. THAT'S FOUR TIMES AS

01:06:03.125 --> 01:06:04.660
MUCH LAND AS THE ENTIRE CITY OF

01:06:04.727 --> 01:06:08.497
SAN FRANCISCO. L. A. COUNTY HAS

01:06:08.564 --> 01:06:09.031
EIGHTEEN POINT SIX MILLION

01:06:09.098 --> 01:06:11.367

01:06:11.434 --> 01:06:14.170
TIME WE ALSO KNOW THAT WE HAVE.

01:06:14.236 --> 01:06:15.604
PARKING SPACES THAT ARE NOT

01:06:15.671 --> 01:06:17.073
USED TO MY IN MY OWN DISTRICT

01:06:17.139 --> 01:06:18.874
OFFICE IN BURBANK. I HAVE A

01:06:18.941 --> 01:06:21.043
PARKING LOT THAT IS USED FOR MY

01:06:21.110 --> 01:06:22.311
BUILDING THAT EVEN BEFORE COVE

01:06:22.378 --> 01:06:25.548
IT WAS MAYBE MAYBE A TEN FILLED

01:06:25.614 --> 01:06:27.249
THROUGHOUT THE DAY. OF THAT

01:06:27.316 --> 01:06:29.385
CITY STORE REQUIRES ANY NEW

01:06:29.452 --> 01:06:30.820
HOUSING UNIT TO ROUTE TO

01:06:30.886 --> 01:06:32.755
PROVIDE AT LEAST TWO PARKING

01:06:32.822 --> 01:06:34.690

01:06:34.757 --> 01:06:37.159
EMPTY PARKING LOTS ALL AROUND

01:06:37.226 --> 01:06:39.495
THEIR DOWNTOWN AREA. FORTINO

01:06:39.562 --> 01:06:40.896
ONE IS A COMMON SENSE BILL TO

01:06:40.963 --> 01:06:42.832
ALLOW THE BUILDERS OF NEW

01:06:42.898 --> 01:06:45.101
PROJECTS TO ALLOW DEVELOPERS TO

01:06:45.167 --> 01:06:48.537
RIGHT SIZE THE PARKING FOR

01:06:48.604 --> 01:06:49.572
THEIR PARTICULAR DEVELOPMENT.

01:06:49.638 --> 01:06:50.940
IT ALLOWS THEM TO LOOK AT WHO

01:06:51.006 --> 01:06:52.208
THEIR CUSTOMER IS GOING TO BE

01:06:52.274 --> 01:06:54.176
OR THEIR TENANT IS GOING TO BE.

01:06:54.243 --> 01:06:55.511
AND DECIDE FOR THEMSELVES HOW

01:06:55.578 --> 01:06:56.979

01:06:57.046 --> 01:06:59.048

01:06:59.115 --> 01:07:00.149

QUALITY TRANSIT PLACES WERE WE

01:07:02.184 --> 01:07:04.153

01:07:07.523 --> 01:07:09.558
MISTAKE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION

01:07:09.625 --> 01:07:10.993
DOES NOT WORK IN SPRAWLING

01:07:11.060 --> 01:07:12.461

01:07:29.278 --> 01:07:30.880
REASON WHY MANY HOUSING UNITS

01:08:11.253 --> 01:08:11.987

01:08:14.757 --> 01:08:15.958

01:08:18.027 --> 01:08:19.695
THE GOAL OF REMOVING EXCESSIVE

01:08:19.762 --> 01:08:22.164
PARKING REQUIREMENTS I FELT THE

01:08:22.231 --> 01:08:23.332
BILL STILL NEEDED MORE WORK

01:08:23.399 --> 01:08:25.935

JUSTICE GROUPS HAVE EXPRESSED

01:08:33.542 --> 01:08:34.910
VERY WHAT I THINK ARE VERY

01:08:34.977 --> 01:08:36.946
LEGITIMATE CONCERNS ABOUT THE

01:08:42.084 --> 01:08:43.352
WANT TO BE CLEAR I FULLY

01:08:43.419 --> 01:08:44.954
SUPPORT REMOVING PARKING

01:08:45.020 --> 01:08:46.889
MINIMUMS. BUT I ALSO SUPPORT

01:08:46.956 --> 01:08:48.691
POLICIES THAT MAXIMIZE DENSITY

01:08:48.757 --> 01:08:50.693

01:08:53.929 --> 01:08:57.533
VERY WORTHY GOALS THAT WE

01:09:00.469 --> 01:09:01.470
KIND OF POLICIES THAT WE NEED

01:09:05.274 --> 01:09:06.942
ADDRESS THE CLIMATE CRISIS BUT

01:09:07.009 --> 01:09:09.512
DE LINKING PARKING REDUCTIONS.

01:09:09.578 --> 01:09:10.980
FROM THE DENSITY BONUS

01:09:11.046 --> 01:09:13.182
FRAMEWORK WHICH THIS BILL DOES

01:09:13.249 --> 01:09:15.317
MEANS THAT WE FAIL TO CAPTURE.

01:09:15.384 --> 01:09:16.952
THE VALUE OF ANY BENEFIT THAT'S

01:09:17.019 --> 01:09:19.021
CONVEYED WE MISS OUT ON THE

01:09:19.088 --> 01:09:20.222
PRODUCTION OF NEW AFFORDABLE

01:09:20.289 --> 01:09:21.690
UNITS AND FOREGO THE

01:09:21.757 --> 01:09:23.826
POSSIBILITY TO GET MORE DENSITY

01:09:23.893 --> 01:09:26.862
NEAR TRANSIT. AND I BELIEVE

01:09:26.929 --> 01:09:27.963
THAT'S A MISSED OPPORTUNITY

01:09:28.030 --> 01:09:30.366
IT'S ALSO. TO THE DETRIMENT OF

01:09:30.432 --> 01:09:32.134
HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM SUCH

01:09:32.201 --> 01:09:34.270
AS L. A. X. TRANSIT ORIENTED

01:09:34.336 --> 01:09:36.372
COMMUNITY PROGRAM. WHICH IS

01:09:36.438 --> 01:09:37.439
DELIVERED THOUSANDS OF

01:09:37.506 --> 01:09:39.041
AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS NEAR

01:09:39.108 --> 01:09:40.676
TRANSIT IN THE PAST SEVERAL

01:09:40.743 --> 01:09:44.547
YEARS AS A TRADE OFF FOR LESS

01:09:44.613 --> 01:09:47.449
PARKING. SUPPORTING EQUITY AND

01:09:47.516 --> 01:09:48.150
INCLUSION WHILE REDUCING

01:09:48.217 --> 01:09:50.786
PARKING MINIMUMS WOULD BE A WIN

01:09:50.853 --> 01:09:53.389
FOR HOUSING AND THE ENVIRONMENT

01:09:53.455 --> 01:09:54.390
AND THAT'S WHAT I THINK WE

01:09:54.456 --> 01:09:56.292
SHOULD SEEK WITH THIS BILL. AND

01:09:56.358 --> 01:09:58.961
LEAVING THOSE BENEFITS BEHIND.

01:09:59.028 --> 01:10:00.496
UNDERMINE SOME OF THE VERY

01:10:00.563 --> 01:10:03.399
GOALS OF THE BILL. SO I AM BUT

01:10:03.465 --> 01:10:04.800
I VOTING FOR THE BILL TODAY

01:10:04.867 --> 01:10:06.068
BECAUSE I WANT TO ALLOW TIME

01:10:06.135 --> 01:10:07.636
FOR CRITICAL CONVERSATIONS TO

01:10:07.703 --> 01:10:09.071
TAKE PLACE THE AUTHOR VERY

01:10:09.138 --> 01:10:12.041
GRACIOUSLY HAS SAID THAT- SHE

01:10:12.107 --> 01:10:13.208
WILL ENTERTAIN THOSE

01:10:13.275 --> 01:10:15.778
CONVERSATIONS. OPPONENTS OF THE

01:10:15.844 --> 01:10:17.580
BILL SUPPORT REDUCE PARKING AS

01:10:17.646 --> 01:10:21.450
I DO. AND I BELIEVE THAT WITH

01:10:21.517 --> 01:10:23.719
SOME AMENDMENTS BOTH GOALS CAN

01:10:23.786 --> 01:10:25.854
BE ACHIEVED AND I HOPE TO SEE

01:10:25.921 --> 01:10:28.591
AN IMPROVED BILL OF- RETURNED

01:10:28.657 --> 01:10:31.093
AFTER IT'S BEEN AMENDED. I

01:10:31.160 --> 01:10:32.394

THIS MEASURE FOR ALL WITH AB

01:12:09.558 --> 01:12:11.093
FORTINO ONE WE'RE WOULD

01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:12.394
HOPEFULLY BE ABLE TO REFLECT

01:12:12.461 --> 01:12:13.162
SOMETHING THAT WE'VE ALREADY

01:12:13.228 --> 01:12:14.797
DONE IN THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO

01:12:14.863 --> 01:12:16.632
WHEN I WAS ON COUNCIL IN TWO

01:12:16.699 --> 01:12:17.466
THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN. WE

01:12:17.533 --> 01:12:20.202
ACTUALLY PASSED DESPITE MANY OF

01:12:20.269 --> 01:12:21.370
THE SAME CONVERSATIONS AND

01:12:21.437 --> 01:12:22.738
OBJECTIONS A VERY STRONG

01:12:22.805 --> 01:12:24.073
OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABLE TO

01:12:24.139 --> 01:12:25.674
REDUCE OUR PARKING MINIMUMS

01:12:25.741 --> 01:12:27.009
WHAT THAT WAS FOUNDED ON WITH A

01:12:27.076 --> 01:12:28.677
COUPLE OF PRINCIPLES ONE

01:12:28.744 --> 01:12:30.946
PARKING IS EXPENSIVE AND IT

01:12:31.013 --> 01:12:33.015
ADDS ACOSTA DIRECTLY IS BEING

01:12:33.082 --> 01:12:33.982
PASSED ON TO CONSUMERS AND THE

01:12:34.049 --> 01:12:36.785
RENTERS. TO PARKING IS

01:12:36.852 --> 01:12:38.620
SURPRISINGLY OVER ABUNDANT WHAT

01:12:38.687 --> 01:12:40.055
WE SAW IN THE DOWNTOWN SAN

01:12:40.122 --> 01:12:41.990
DIEGO PLANNING AREA WAS THAT

01:12:42.057 --> 01:12:42.991
UPON A RESIDENTIAL PARKING

01:12:43.058 --> 01:12:46.662
SURVEY 30% OF THE UNDERGROUND

01:12:46.729 --> 01:12:48.330
PARKING TIED TO THE UNITS ABOVE

01:12:48.397 --> 01:12:52.835
GROUND WITH UNUSED UNUSED AND

01:12:52.901 --> 01:12:54.336
WHAT TWENTY THOUSAND PROBABLY

01:12:54.403 --> 01:12:55.838
CLOSER TO SEVENTY THOUSAND

01:12:55.904 --> 01:12:56.972
DOLLARS FOR THOSE KINDS OF

01:12:57.039 --> 01:12:58.407
PARKING CONSTRUCTION COSTS.

01:12:58.474 --> 01:13:00.142
THAT IS SIGNIFICANT EXPENSE

01:13:00.209 --> 01:13:02.077
PASSED ON TO THE- RESPECTIVE

01:13:02.144 --> 01:13:04.346
OWNER PASSED ON TO THE RENTER

01:13:04.413 --> 01:13:05.814
SO WHAT WE CAN DO IS MAKE SURE

01:13:05.881 --> 01:13:07.015
THROUGH THIS BILL THE

01:13:07.082 --> 01:13:08.383
RETREATING PARKING WHAT IT WHAT

01:13:08.450 --> 01:13:09.952
IS WHICH IS A COMMODITY WHICH

01:13:10.018 --> 01:13:12.287
IS AMENITY WHICH IS A TWICE AND

01:13:12.354 --> 01:13:14.356
WE SHOULDN'T HAVE ARTIFICIAL

01:13:14.423 --> 01:13:15.824
MINIMUMS PLACED INTO ANY CODES

01:13:15.891 --> 01:13:17.259
RIGHT NOW. THAT ARE PUSHING

01:13:17.326 --> 01:13:18.327
SOME OF THE CHOICES BECAUSE

01:13:18.393 --> 01:13:19.661
SOME OF THOSE DON'T NEED TO BE

01:13:19.728 --> 01:13:21.263
USE THOSE COSTS DON'T NEED TO

01:13:21.330 --> 01:13:22.698
BE PASSED ON TO THE RENTERS IF

01:13:22.765 --> 01:13:23.766
WE MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE

01:13:23.832 --> 01:13:25.100
ALLOWING THE FLEXIBILITY WHAT

01:13:25.167 --> 01:13:26.535
YOU'RE GOING TO FIND IS THAT

01:13:26.602 --> 01:13:28.170
THE DEVELOPERS ARE GOING TO

01:13:28.237 --> 01:13:30.672
ACTUALLY DECIDE MAYBE I DO WANT

01:13:30.739 --> 01:13:32.374
ONE UNIT PER BEDROOM MAYBE I

01:13:32.441 --> 01:13:33.909
WANT TO ACTUALLY REDUCE IT TO

01:13:33.976 --> 01:13:35.677
YOU KNOW ZERO FOUR POINT FIVE.

01:13:35.744 --> 01:13:37.312
BECAUSE THE CHOICE IS GOING TO

01:13:37.379 --> 01:13:38.714
COME DOWN TO THE RENTER OR THE

01:13:38.781 --> 01:13:40.382
CONSUMER AND THEY'RE GOING TO

01:13:40.449 --> 01:13:41.583
CHOOSE WHETHER OR NOT THEY WANT

01:13:41.650 --> 01:13:43.452
THAT UNIT BECAUSE IT MAY OR MAY

01:13:43.519 --> 01:13:44.987
NOT HAVE PARKING AND THEY MAY

01:13:45.053 --> 01:13:46.155
OR MAY NOT WANT TO ASSUME SOME

01:13:46.221 --> 01:13:47.856
OF THAT EXPENSE AND WHEN YOU

01:13:47.923 --> 01:13:48.757
LOOK AT THAT AND THE CUMULATIVE

01:13:48.824 --> 01:13:50.192
EFFECT OVER ALL OF OUR

01:13:50.259 --> 01:13:51.527
RESIDENTIAL HOUSING SUPPLY.

01:13:51.593 --> 01:13:51.994
YOU'RE GOING TO SEE A

01:13:52.060 --> 01:13:53.862
SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE

01:13:53.929 --> 01:13:55.130
ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO MITIGATE

01:13:55.197 --> 01:13:57.266
AND POSSIBLY EVEN REDUCE SOME

01:13:57.332 --> 01:14:03.772
OF THE HOUSING COSTS. IT'S SO

01:14:03.839 --> 01:14:04.406
MANY CALIFORNIANS ARE PRESSURED

01:14:04.473 --> 01:14:05.207

BUILDING HIGHER DENSITY ALONG

TRANSIT IS A CRITICAL

01:15:35.597 --> 01:15:37.933
COMPONENT. NOT JUST FOR

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.435
INCREASING ACCESS AND USAGE OF

01:15:40.502 --> 01:15:42.504
TRANSIT. NOT ONLY FOR CREATING

01:15:42.571 --> 01:15:44.139
HIGHER DENSITY HOUSING WHICH WE

FAMILY. NAKED SPRAWLED OUT

01:16:01.957 --> 01:16:02.457
NEIGHBORHOODS WERE ACTUALLY

01:16:02.524 --> 01:16:05.794
BUILDING. MORE DENSELY ALONG

01:16:05.861 --> 01:16:07.930
THE TRANSIT QUARTERS BECAUSE-

01:16:07.996 --> 01:16:08.830
IT'S QUITE SIMPLY THE RIGHT

01:16:08.897 --> 01:16:11.400
THING TO DO. AND THE OTHER DAY

01:16:11.466 --> 01:16:14.069
I WAS DRIVING ALONG- FIVE

01:16:14.136 --> 01:16:16.238
EIGHTY. PASSING ALL OVER A LOT

01:16:16.305 --> 01:16:17.105
OF THESE DIFFERENT TOWNS THAT

01:16:17.172 --> 01:16:19.808
HAD. AND PUSH FOR LOBBIED FOR

01:16:19.875 --> 01:16:21.710
THESE WONDERFUL BART STATIONS.

01:16:21.777 --> 01:16:25.881
AROUND THE BAR STATIONS. THERE

01:16:25.948 --> 01:16:28.517
ARE NO HOUSING. A THIS COMPUTER

01:16:28.583 --> 01:16:29.718
A LAW TRANS LINES THROUGH

01:16:29.785 --> 01:16:32.821
CALIFORNIA BUS ONE. THROW CAL.

01:16:32.888 --> 01:16:35.924
SO I ALWAYS HAVING FROM SO

01:16:35.991 --> 01:16:37.726
COUNCIL LOCAL CONTROL. BUT I'LL

01:16:37.793 --> 01:16:40.095
TELL YOU TRANSIT ORDERS ARE NOT

01:16:40.162 --> 01:16:42.431
A LOCAL ASSET THE REGIONAL- AND

01:16:42.497 --> 01:16:45.701
ONLY BUILD TRANSIT AND WE BUILT

01:16:45.767 --> 01:16:46.902
TO. DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES

01:16:46.969 --> 01:16:48.136
THERE'S A RESPONSIBILITY ON

01:16:48.203 --> 01:16:50.205
EVERY COMMUNITY BUT ALONG THOSE

01:16:50.272 --> 01:16:53.175
TRANSIT LINES TO DO THEIR PART.

01:16:53.241 --> 01:16:54.476
TO RELIEVE THE PRESSURE ON

01:16:54.543 --> 01:16:56.678
HOUSING IN OUR STATE AND IN OUR

01:16:56.745 --> 01:17:00.315
COMMUNITIES AND FOR THAT REASON

01:17:00.382 --> 01:17:00.882
I STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS BILL

01:17:00.949 --> 01:17:03.051
THANK YOU. THANKS KALRA MISSED

THE AUTHOR OF THIS BILL AND I

01:17:11.727 --> 01:17:15.230
FEEL LIKE NINETY. OVER 95% OF

01:17:15.297 --> 01:17:16.465
THE TIME WE'RE VERY MUCH IN

01:17:16.531 --> 01:17:19.334
SYNC AND ALIGNED. AND THE VERY

01:17:19.401 --> 01:17:21.236
ARGUMENTS THAT WERE STATED

01:17:21.303 --> 01:17:23.438
RIGHT NOW BY COLLEAGUES FROM

01:17:23.505 --> 01:17:26.141
SAN JOSE OR SAN DIEGO OR OF LOS

01:17:26.208 --> 01:17:30.479
ANGELES AS WELL. I AGREE WITH.

01:17:30.545 --> 01:17:33.248
BUT IT'S VERY INTERESTING THAT

01:17:33.315 --> 01:17:33.815
THAT WE COME TO A DIFFERENT

01:17:33.882 --> 01:17:37.619
CONCLUSION. I DO NOT I I'M

01:17:37.686 --> 01:17:38.987
STRUGGLING WITH THIS BILL TO

01:17:39.054 --> 01:17:43.258
SEE HOW THIS WOULD INCENTIVIZE.

01:17:43.325 --> 01:17:45.761
MORE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT THAT

01:17:45.827 --> 01:17:48.964
WOULD ALLOW US TO PROVIDE THE

01:17:49.031 --> 01:17:51.099
NECESSARY HOUSING. FOR

01:17:51.166 --> 01:17:55.404
CONSTITUENTS WHEN YOU ALLOW A

01:17:55.470 --> 01:17:57.139
DEVELOPER TO DO WHATEVER IT IS

01:17:57.205 --> 01:17:58.607
THAT THEY'REGONNA DO THEY WILL

01:17:58.673 --> 01:18:01.176
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT BECAUSE

01:18:01.243 --> 01:18:05.180
THAT IS HOW. THEY WILL PROCEED

01:18:05.247 --> 01:18:08.784
WITH THEIR WORK. AT IT WE HAVE

01:18:08.850 --> 01:18:10.585
PLACED REGULATIONS FOR REASONS

01:18:10.652 --> 01:18:12.454
AND SO IF WE WANT TO MAKE

01:18:12.521 --> 01:18:14.890
CHANGES TO THE WAY OUR LOCAL

01:18:14.956 --> 01:18:16.792
JURISDICTIONS ADDRESS THE

01:18:16.858 --> 01:18:19.027
SHORTAGE OF HOUSING WE NEED TO

01:18:19.094 --> 01:18:21.163
LOOK AT INCENTIVES I WOULD HAVE

01:18:21.229 --> 01:18:23.365
SUPPORTED THIS BILL. OR I WOULD

01:18:23.432 --> 01:18:24.499
HAVE BEEN GREATLY COMFORTABLE

01:18:24.566 --> 01:18:26.802
WITH IT IF THERE WAS A FORMULA

01:18:26.868 --> 01:18:29.271
INCENTIVE ATTACHED TO CITIES TO

01:18:29.337 --> 01:18:32.174
ACCEPT THIS TO THEN GET CERTAIN

01:18:32.240 --> 01:18:35.177
TYPE FUNDING FOR MORE TRANSIT

01:18:35.243 --> 01:18:36.511
FOR MORE DEVELOPMENT OF TRANSIT

01:18:36.578 --> 01:18:38.513
HOUSING AND TRANSPORTATION IS

01:18:38.580 --> 01:18:41.917
COMPLETELY. INTERTWINED IN

01:18:41.983 --> 01:18:44.986
ORDER TO GET BETTER HOUSING

01:18:45.053 --> 01:18:46.521
ADOPTED WE NEED TO MAKE THE

01:18:46.588 --> 01:18:49.124
APPROPRIATE TRANSIT AND RAIL

01:18:49.191 --> 01:18:51.059
INVESTMENTS IN OUR LOCAL

01:18:51.126 --> 01:18:53.528
JURISDICTIONS AND TO BE QUITE

01:18:53.595 --> 01:18:55.430
FRANK I WANT ONE ONE OF THE

01:18:55.497 --> 01:18:57.933
COMMENTS I DIDN'T COMPLETELY

01:18:57.999 --> 01:18:59.701
AGREE WITH. CHANGES IN SAN

01:18:59.768 --> 01:19:02.104
FRANCISCO OR SAN DIEGO CANNOT

01:19:02.170 --> 01:19:03.839
BE APPLIED TO PLACES LIKE LOS

01:19:03.905 --> 01:19:07.042
ANGELES. IT IS THE THESE ARE

01:19:07.109 --> 01:19:09.211
VERY DIFFERENT AREAS WITH

01:19:09.277 --> 01:19:11.546
DIFFERENT CAPACITIES AND

01:19:11.613 --> 01:19:14.349
DIFFERENT ISSUES- SO I

01:19:14.416 --> 01:19:15.917
RESPECTFULLY WILL BE LAYING OFF

01:19:15.984 --> 01:19:17.252
OF THIS BILL TODAY I HOPE TO

01:19:17.319 --> 01:19:19.087
CONTINUE WORKING WITH THE

01:19:19.154 --> 01:19:21.156
AUTHOR AND OUR COLLEAGUES TO BE

01:19:21.223 --> 01:19:21.790
ABLE TO COME TO A PLACE WHERE I

01:19:21.857 --> 01:19:24.192
CAN SUPPORT. BUT I JUST SEE TOO

01:19:24.259 --> 01:19:25.527
MANY CONCERNS WITH THIS AND

01:19:25.594 --> 01:19:27.429
LAST BUT NOT LEAST I HAVEN'T

01:19:27.496 --> 01:19:28.630
SEEN THIS IN ANY OF THE

01:19:28.697 --> 01:19:30.899
ANALYSIS BUT THE REALITY FOLKS

01:19:30.966 --> 01:19:35.237
IS MOST AMERICANS RELY ON THEIR-

01:19:35.303 --> 01:19:37.205
ON THEIR SINGLE FAMILY HOMES.

01:19:37.272 --> 01:19:39.007
TO BE THEIR MAIN INVESTMENT

01:19:39.074 --> 01:19:41.042
OVER 70% OF AMERICANS TREAT

01:19:41.109 --> 01:19:44.045
THEIR HOMES AS THEIR PRIMARY

01:19:44.112 --> 01:19:46.915
SOURCE OF INVESTMENT. WHEN WE

01:19:46.982 --> 01:19:49.251
MAKE TOO MANY CHANGES LIKE THIS

01:19:49.317 --> 01:19:50.352
IT WILL EVENTUALLY START

01:19:50.418 --> 01:19:54.823
ERODING. THAT INVESTMENT I AM

01:19:54.890 --> 01:19:56.158
USING THIS ONLY AS A LAST

01:19:56.224 --> 01:19:57.559
ARGUMENT BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE

01:19:57.626 --> 01:19:59.127
THE DATE ON THIS TO FEEL VERY

01:19:59.194 --> 01:20:02.230
CONFIDENT TO SPEAK OF THIS BUT

01:20:02.297 --> 01:20:04.799
BUT AFTER YEARS OF LOOKING AT

01:20:04.866 --> 01:20:07.335
HOW THINGS WORK I AM CAN THAT

01:20:07.402 --> 01:20:08.870
THIS WILL AN EVENTUAL WEAR AND

01:20:08.937 --> 01:20:12.674
TEAR ON PEOPLE SINGLE FAMILY

01:20:12.741 --> 01:20:13.275
INVESTMENTS AND THAT CONCERNS

01:20:13.341 --> 01:20:18.280
ME. THANK YOU. THE TECHNICIAN

01:20:18.346 --> 01:20:19.614
IS THERE AND SEEING NO OTHER

01:20:19.681 --> 01:20:21.650
MEMBERS SEEKING RECOGNITION ON

01:20:21.716 --> 01:20:23.585
THE BILL MS FRIEDMAN YOU MAY

01:20:23.652 --> 01:20:25.487
CLOSE THANK YOU I REALLY

01:20:25.554 --> 01:20:26.721
APPRECIATE ALL OF THE ISSUES

01:20:26.788 --> 01:20:28.156
THAT WERE RAISED I APPRECIATE

01:20:28.223 --> 01:20:29.357
THE ROBUST DEBATE I DID WANT TO

01:20:29.424 --> 01:20:30.892
JUST MAYBE ANSWER A FEW OF THE

01:20:30.959 --> 01:20:34.563
CONCERNS FIRST OF ALL. IN TERMS

01:20:34.629 --> 01:20:36.097
OF TRANSIT INVESTMENTS LET'S

01:20:36.164 --> 01:20:37.632
ALSO KEEP IN MIND THAT THIS

01:20:37.699 --> 01:20:39.100
BILL ONLY AFFECTS AREAS WHERE

01:20:39.167 --> 01:20:40.535
WE HAVE ALREADY MADE. AS A

01:20:40.602 --> 01:20:42.404
STATE NOT THE REGION MAJOR

01:20:42.470 --> 01:20:44.039
INVESTMENTS IN THESE

01:20:44.105 --> 01:20:45.574
COMMUNITIES AND IN THESE HIGH

01:20:45.640 --> 01:20:47.609
QUALITY TRANSIT AREAS. THE BILL

01:20:47.676 --> 01:20:48.810
DOES NOT TAKE EFFECT IN AN AREA

01:20:48.877 --> 01:20:50.011
WHERE WE THINK WE MIGHT ONE DAY

01:20:50.078 --> 01:20:51.680
HAVE HIGH QUALITY TRANSIT TAKES

01:20:51.746 --> 01:20:53.448
AFFECTED AREAS THAT RIGHT NOW.

01:20:53.515 --> 01:20:55.350
A VERY HIGH LEVEL HIGH QUALITY

01:20:55.417 --> 01:20:57.052
TRANSIT WHERE WE'RE TRYING TO

01:20:57.118 --> 01:20:58.286
ATTRACT PEOPLE WHO WANT THE

01:20:58.353 --> 01:20:59.754
KIND OF LIFESTYLE WHERE MAYBE.

01:20:59.821 --> 01:21:01.456
THEY DON'T OWN THEIR OWN CAR OR

01:21:01.523 --> 01:21:02.257
MAYBE THEIR FAMILY OWNS ONE

01:21:02.324 --> 01:21:04.893
CAR. AND YET MOST LOCALITIES

01:21:04.960 --> 01:21:06.728
STILL REQUIRE DEVELOPERS

01:21:06.795 --> 01:21:08.196
REQUIRED THEM TO ADD MORE

01:21:08.263 --> 01:21:09.331
PARKING THE MOST DEVELOPERS

01:21:09.397 --> 01:21:11.533
OFTEN- THEY THEY NEED. LEADING

01:21:11.600 --> 01:21:14.636
TO. DEVELOPMENTS THAT HAVE.

01:21:14.703 --> 01:21:16.004
HALF EMPTY QUARTER EMPTY

01:21:16.071 --> 01:21:17.505
PARKING LOTS OFTEN RIGHT

01:21:17.572 --> 01:21:18.540
ADJACENT TO COMMERCIAL

01:21:18.607 --> 01:21:19.975
BUILDINGS THAT MIGHT HAVE A

01:21:20.041 --> 01:21:22.510
PARKING USED DURING THE DAY BUT

01:21:22.577 --> 01:21:23.678
EMPTY AT NIGHT. COMMUNITIES

01:21:23.745 --> 01:21:25.447
THAT HAVE HAD PROBLEMS WITH

01:21:25.513 --> 01:21:26.915
SPILLOVER PARKING WITH AREAS

01:21:26.982 --> 01:21:28.016
THAT ARE OLDER MAYBE THAT DON'T

01:21:28.083 --> 01:21:29.951
HAVE AS MANY PARKING LOTS HAVE

01:21:30.018 --> 01:21:31.553
SOLD THOSE THEY'VE SOLVE THEM

01:21:31.620 --> 01:21:34.356
WITH BETTER PARKING MANAGEMENT.

01:21:34.422 --> 01:21:34.956
THEY'VE SOLVE THEM WITH BETTER

01:21:35.023 --> 01:21:37.425
TRANSIT. BUT AREAS THAT HAVEN'T

01:21:37.492 --> 01:21:39.394
HAD THE PUSH TO DO THAT. HAVE

01:21:39.461 --> 01:21:41.329
GOT US WHERE WE ARE TODAY WHICH

01:21:41.396 --> 01:21:43.531
IS AN UNSUSTAINABLE SYSTEM WE

01:21:43.598 --> 01:21:45.667
HAVE GROWING TRAFFIC CONGESTION

01:21:45.734 --> 01:21:47.502
GROWING POLLUTION BAD AIR

01:21:47.569 --> 01:21:49.471
QUALITY TERRIBLE LAND USE

01:21:49.537 --> 01:21:51.973
PATTERNS WE HAVE TWO LITTLE

01:21:52.040 --> 01:21:53.942
GREEN SPACE TOO LITTLE HOUSING

01:21:54.009 --> 01:21:55.710
BECAUSE WE DEVOTE SO MUCH OF

01:21:55.777 --> 01:21:57.345
OUR LAND SO MUCH OF A REAL

01:21:57.412 --> 01:21:59.614
ESTATE. TO AUTOMOBILES RIGHT

01:21:59.681 --> 01:22:01.049
NEAR WHERE WE HAVE MADE MAJOR

01:22:01.116 --> 01:22:03.118
INVESTMENTS IN PUBLIC

01:22:03.184 --> 01:22:04.619
TRANSPORTATION NOW. THIS IS NOT

01:22:04.686 --> 01:22:07.255
A RADICAL IDEA THIS IDEA OF NOT

01:22:07.322 --> 01:22:08.023
REQUIRING THESE PARKING

01:22:08.089 --> 01:22:09.291
MINIMUMS HAS BEEN DONE IT'S

01:22:09.357 --> 01:22:10.659
BEEN DONE IN SAN DIEGO IT'S

01:22:10.725 --> 01:22:12.227
BEEN DONE IN SAN FRANCISCO WAS

01:22:12.294 --> 01:22:13.228
RECENTLY DONE BERKELEY IT WAS

01:22:13.295 --> 01:22:15.163
DONE IN BUFFALO NEW YORK ALMOST

01:22:15.230 --> 01:22:16.464
TEN YEARS AGO. AND WHAT

01:22:16.531 --> 01:22:18.600
HAPPENED WHAT HAPPENED WHEN

01:22:18.667 --> 01:22:20.101
THEY DID THIS GRAND EXPERIMENT.

01:22:20.168 --> 01:22:21.970
MOST DEVELOPERS MANY DEVELOPERS

01:22:22.037 --> 01:22:24.973
STILL BUILT PARKING PEOPLE WHO

01:22:25.040 --> 01:22:25.774
ARE BUILDING MARKET RATE

01:22:25.840 --> 01:22:27.676
HOUSING OFTEN STILL BUILT THE

01:22:27.742 --> 01:22:29.878
SAME AMOUNT OF PARKING. BUT

01:22:29.944 --> 01:22:31.546
WHERE DID IT MAKE A DIFFERENCE

01:22:31.613 --> 01:22:32.414
BUILDING FOR THAT MISSING

01:22:32.480 --> 01:22:33.915
MIDDLE PEOPLE WHO WANTED TO

01:22:33.982 --> 01:22:34.616
BUILD THE STUDENT HOUSING

01:22:34.683 --> 01:22:36.251
PEOPLE WHO WANTED TO BUILD THE

01:22:36.318 --> 01:22:38.253
SMALLER STARTER APARTMENTS.

01:22:38.320 --> 01:22:38.953
THEY REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF

01:22:39.020 --> 01:22:41.323
PARKING. AND WERE ABLE TO RENT

01:22:41.389 --> 01:22:43.792
THOSE UNITS FOR LESS.

01:22:43.858 --> 01:22:45.293
COMMERCIAL DEVELOPERS STARTED

01:22:45.360 --> 01:22:46.194
TO GET CREATIVE AND WORK

01:22:46.261 --> 01:22:47.929
TOGETHER SHARE PARKING LOTS

01:22:47.996 --> 01:22:48.730
THEY STARTED SEEING A LOT OF

01:22:48.797 --> 01:22:49.898
THAT IN BUFFALO WE'RE TO

01:22:49.964 --> 01:22:51.700
DEVELOPERS WOULD SAY. WE HAVE

01:22:51.766 --> 01:22:52.834
TO LOCK WITH BILL ONE LOCKED

01:22:52.901 --> 01:22:55.770
TOGETHER FOR PARKING. AND BUILD

01:22:55.837 --> 01:22:58.973
MIXED USE WITH HOUSING. NOW IN

01:22:59.040 --> 01:22:59.607
TERMS OF THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING

01:22:59.674 --> 01:23:02.577
ARGUMENT. THE REASON THAT WE

01:23:02.644 --> 01:23:03.678
ARE ABLE TO GIVE DENSITY

01:23:03.745 --> 01:23:05.380
BONUSES TO DEVELOPERS IN

01:23:05.447 --> 01:23:05.947
EXCHANGE FOR THEM BUILDING

01:23:06.014 --> 01:23:07.716
AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS THAT BY

01:23:07.782 --> 01:23:09.017
GIVING THEM HIGHER DENSITY

01:23:09.084 --> 01:23:10.752
WE'RE ADDING VALUE TO THOSE

01:23:10.819 --> 01:23:12.187
LOTS. WHEN THEY BUILD MORE

01:23:12.253 --> 01:23:13.922
UNITS THEY FOREVER HAVE A

01:23:13.988 --> 01:23:14.923
HIGHER RETURN ON THEIR

01:23:14.989 --> 01:23:16.524
INVESTMENT THEY CAN RENT THOSE

01:23:16.591 --> 01:23:18.426
APARTMENTS OVER TIME. WHEN WE

01:23:18.493 --> 01:23:20.495
GIVE THEM PARKING REDUCTIONS WE

01:23:20.562 --> 01:23:21.896
HAVE NOT ADDED THE VALUE YES

01:23:21.963 --> 01:23:23.498
WE'VE REDUCED MARGINALLY THE

01:23:23.565 --> 01:23:25.367
COST OF BUILDING THOSE UNITS.

01:23:25.433 --> 01:23:27.502
BUT THEY KNOW. WHAT MARKET RATE

01:23:27.569 --> 01:23:29.471
DEVELOPERS KNOW WHICH IS THAT

01:23:29.537 --> 01:23:30.572
THOSE UNITS WILL RENT FOR LESS

01:23:30.638 --> 01:23:33.708
MONEY IF THEY DON'T HAVE THOSE

01:23:33.775 --> 01:23:34.309
TWO PARKING SPACES AND WE ALL

01:23:34.376 --> 01:23:36.177
KNOW THAT. SO OFFERING THEM

01:23:36.244 --> 01:23:37.312
JUST A PARKING REDUCTION HAS

01:23:37.379 --> 01:23:38.613
NEVER RESULTED AS FAR AS I

01:23:38.680 --> 01:23:40.382
COULD SEE IN ONE UNIT OF

01:23:40.448 --> 01:23:42.417
AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THEY ARE

01:23:42.484 --> 01:23:43.985
TAKING A DENSITY BONUS FOR

01:23:44.052 --> 01:23:45.987
THOSE EXTRA UNITS THE PARKING

01:23:46.054 --> 01:23:48.289
REDUCTION IS OFFERED TO THEM TO

01:23:48.356 --> 01:23:49.257
SERVICE THAT HIGHER DENSITY

01:23:49.324 --> 01:23:51.626
ONLY. I ASK THE ADVOCATES SHOW

01:23:51.693 --> 01:23:53.161
ME A UNITS ONLY A PERKY A

01:23:53.228 --> 01:23:55.296
BUILDING. WHERE DEVELOPER ONLY

01:23:55.363 --> 01:23:56.564
TOOK THAT PARKING REDUCTION IN

01:23:56.631 --> 01:23:58.333
EXCHANGE FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING

01:23:58.400 --> 01:23:59.234
THEY COULDN'T SHOW ME ONE

01:23:59.300 --> 01:24:00.969
EXAMPLE OF THAT BECAUSE THE

01:24:01.035 --> 01:24:02.170
PARKING REDUCTION IS NOT THE

01:24:02.237 --> 01:24:03.838
PRIZE THE PRIZE IS THE EXTRA

01:24:03.905 --> 01:24:05.240
DENSITY. AND WE STILL ALLOW

01:24:05.306 --> 01:24:06.174
THAT UNDER THIS BILL THOSE

01:24:06.241 --> 01:24:09.310
DENSITY BONUSES STILL EXIST AND

01:24:09.377 --> 01:24:10.779
WHAT SAN DIEGO SHOWED THAT THEY

01:24:10.845 --> 01:24:11.679
STILL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT

01:24:11.746 --> 01:24:15.216
AND BUILT BUILT THEIR EVEN MORE

01:24:15.283 --> 01:24:16.651
AFFORDABLE UNITS. IN ADDITION.

01:24:16.718 --> 01:24:18.586
MANY OF THE SAME AREAS THAT

01:24:18.653 --> 01:24:19.454
HAVE HIGH QUALITY TRANSIT

01:24:19.521 --> 01:24:21.189
ALREADY HAVE INCLUSIONARY.

01:24:21.256 --> 01:24:23.124
ZONING ORDINANCES THAT REQUIRE

01:24:23.191 --> 01:24:24.859
AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN NEW UNITS

01:24:24.926 --> 01:24:26.561
IN NEW BUILDINGS. SO BY

01:24:26.628 --> 01:24:27.796
ALLOWING THE DEVELOPER TO

01:24:27.862 --> 01:24:29.164
REDUCE SOME OF THEIR COSTS BY

01:24:29.230 --> 01:24:31.032
REDUCING SOME OF THE PARKING.

01:24:31.099 --> 01:24:32.867
WE ARE ACTUALLY GOING TO GET

01:24:32.934 --> 01:24:34.135
MORE AFFORDABLE UNITS BECAUSE

01:24:34.202 --> 01:24:35.637
THEY ALREADY HAVE INCLUSIONARY

01:24:35.703 --> 01:24:37.672
ZONING REQUIREMENTS FOR INCLUDE

01:24:37.739 --> 01:24:40.175
FOR AFFORDABLE UNITS. I THINK

01:24:40.241 --> 01:24:41.776
THIS IS IMPORTANT POLICY I

01:24:41.843 --> 01:24:43.244
THINK THIS SHOWS OUR VALUE THAT

01:24:43.311 --> 01:24:44.045
WE'RE GOING TO PRIORITIZE

01:24:44.112 --> 01:24:46.347
PEOPLE OVER CARS AND THAT'S

01:24:46.414 --> 01:24:47.882
WHAT THIS BILL BILL IS ABOUT.

01:24:47.949 --> 01:24:49.451

EXCEEDS MANY OF THOSE STANDARDS.

01:42:43.524 --> 01:42:44.625
WE SHOULD USE SAN DIEGO'S

01:42:44.691 --> 01:42:46.560

AUTHOR DID A EXCELLENT JOB IN

01:43:46.086 --> 01:43:47.688
PRESENTING THE BILL AND THE

01:43:47.754 --> 01:43:50.190
REASONS WHY. THERE WAS A RIOT

01:43:50.257 --> 01:43:53.093
IN MY CITY- A YEAR AGO FROM

01:43:53.160 --> 01:43:56.430
SUNDAY- SOMETHING HAPPENED

01:43:56.496 --> 01:43:58.298
UNFORTUNATELY WAS AROUND THE

01:43:58.365 --> 01:44:00.767
SAME TIME AS GEORGE FLOYD. AND

01:44:00.834 --> 01:44:02.202
YOU KNOW I COME FROM A VERY

01:44:02.269 --> 01:44:04.905
SMALL CITY- LA MESA WITH HIGHER

SOMETHING THAT HE SHOULD NOT

01:44:11.678 --> 01:44:13.213
HAVE. THE RIGHT WAS A

01:44:13.280 --> 01:44:14.781
REGIONALES FOR SAN DIEGO CAME

01:44:14.848 --> 01:44:19.286
TO MY CITY. IT WAS HORRIFIC- IT

01:44:19.353 --> 01:44:21.221
STARTED OFF AS A VERY PEACEFUL

01:44:21.288 --> 01:44:21.888
PROTESTS BUT LATER IN THE

01:44:21.955 --> 01:44:23.790
EVENING PEOPLE CAME INTO THE

01:44:23.857 --> 01:44:27.861
CITY WITH OTHER OBJECTIVES. AND

01:44:27.928 --> 01:44:28.428
IT TURNED INTO A FULL SCALE

01:44:28.495 --> 01:44:32.599
RIOTS. I'M HAD THIS BILL BEEN

01:44:32.666 --> 01:44:34.401
AND AN AFFECTED PROBABLY WOULD

01:44:34.468 --> 01:44:37.070
NOT HAVE IMPACTED THE OUTCOME

01:44:37.137 --> 01:44:39.640
BECAUSE OUR POLICE OFFICERS DID

01:44:39.706 --> 01:44:43.377
WARN- THE RIOTERS. THAT THEY

01:44:43.443 --> 01:44:46.213
WERE TO DISPERSE- AND YET THEY

01:44:46.279 --> 01:44:47.314
STAYED IN UNFORTUNATELY THE

01:44:47.381 --> 01:44:48.548
ENDED UP BURNING DOWN SOME OF

01:44:48.615 --> 01:44:50.384
OUR BUILDINGS. BUT ONE OF

01:44:50.450 --> 01:44:53.820
THESE- PROJECTILE. WEAPONS WAS

01:44:53.887 --> 01:44:59.192
USED. AND HIT A WOMAN AND I.

01:44:59.259 --> 01:45:03.530
AND SHE IS BLIND IN THAT EYE.

01:45:03.597 --> 01:45:05.399
SO I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS

01:45:05.465 --> 01:45:07.367
BILL BECAUSE IT IS IMPORTANT

01:45:07.434 --> 01:45:09.336
THERE ARE FEWTHINGS IN THIS

01:45:09.403 --> 01:45:10.003
BILL THAT ARE EXTREMELY

01:45:10.070 --> 01:45:14.074
IMPORTANT. ONE IS TRAINING. YOU

01:45:14.141 --> 01:45:15.008
MUST MAKE SURE THAT YOU ARE

01:45:15.075 --> 01:45:17.944
TRAINED TO USE THESE WEAPONS.

01:45:18.011 --> 01:45:19.713
THE SECOND IS THAT YOU SHOULD

01:45:19.780 --> 01:45:22.382
NOT BE INDISCRIMINATELY USING

01:45:22.449 --> 01:45:25.118
THESE WEAPONS AND THE CROWDS.

01:45:25.185 --> 01:45:27.554
THE THIRD IS TRANSPARENCY IT IS

01:45:27.621 --> 01:45:29.623
EXTREMELY IMPORTANT THAT IF AN

01:45:29.690 --> 01:45:32.259
ACCIDENT OCCURS. THAT THERE IS

01:45:32.325 --> 01:45:35.629
A REPORT MADE IMMEDIATELY AND

01:45:35.696 --> 01:45:38.865
THAT CITIZENS ARE AWARE. SO I

01:45:38.932 --> 01:45:41.668
RISE IN SUPPORT AS SOMEONE WHO

01:45:41.735 --> 01:45:44.004
WAS ON CITY COUNCIL WHO HAD TO

01:45:44.071 --> 01:45:46.239
DEAL WITH THIS SITUATION A YEAR

01:45:46.306 --> 01:45:51.178
AGO FROM SUNDAY. IT'S NOT EASY

01:45:51.244 --> 01:45:53.580
DEALING WITH RIOTS ESPECIALLY

01:45:53.647 --> 01:45:54.715
WHEN YOU HAVE PEOPLE COMING

01:45:54.781 --> 01:45:56.583
FROM OUTSIDE TO PURPOSELY DO

01:45:56.650 --> 01:46:00.287
DAMAGE TO YOUR CITY. I FELT FOR

01:46:00.353 --> 01:46:01.955
OUR POLICE OFFICERS THAT DAY

01:46:02.022 --> 01:46:02.956
BECAUSE THEY WERE BEING

01:46:03.023 --> 01:46:05.792
PLUMMETED FOR HOURS WITH ROCKS

01:46:05.859 --> 01:46:09.696
AND BOTTLES. AND SO THIS DOES

01:46:09.763 --> 01:46:11.298
NOT TAKE AWAY THEIR ABILITY TO

01:46:11.364 --> 01:46:13.567
USE IT IF NECESSARY IT PROVIDES

01:46:13.633 --> 01:46:15.502
MORE STANDARDS AND TRAINING AND

01:46:15.569 --> 01:46:18.772
TRANSPARENCY IN THE END. AND

01:46:18.839 --> 01:46:19.606
THAT IS WHY I SUPPORT THIS

01:46:19.673 --> 01:46:22.209

LIKE MANY OF US IN THIS ROOM.

01:52:42.956 --> 01:52:44.591
THIS BILL DOES NOT TAKE AWAY A

01:52:44.657 --> 01:52:46.459
TOOL OUT OF THE TOOL KIT. IT

01:52:46.526 --> 01:52:48.161
RAISES THE STANDARD AND WE

01:52:48.228 --> 01:52:51.164

MY COLLEAGUES SUGGESTING THAT

COMMON SENSE PIECE OF

01:52:59.405 --> 01:53:01.040
LEGISLATION I THINK WE SHOULD

01:53:01.107 --> 01:53:02.509
TAKE IT EVEN FURTHER. BUT I'M

01:53:02.575 --> 01:53:04.310

KNOW IF I COULD- GIVE MUCH MORE

01:53:24.864 --> 01:53:26.499
THAN OUR NEWEST COLLEAGUE HAS

01:53:26.566 --> 01:53:29.435
GIVEN IN THAT BRIEF STATEMENT

01:53:29.502 --> 01:53:31.070
BUT I JUST WANT TO BE SURE

01:53:31.137 --> 01:53:32.105
PEOPLE UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY'RE

01:53:32.172 --> 01:53:33.640
VOTING ON NOTHING IN THIS BILL

01:53:33.706 --> 01:53:36.176
PROHIBITS THE USE OF LESS THAN

01:53:36.242 --> 01:53:38.645
LETHAL FORCE WEAPONS EVEN TEAR

01:53:38.711 --> 01:53:40.280
GAS WHICH I WOULD LIKE TO

01:53:40.346 --> 01:53:42.382
OUTLAW TO BE HONEST. BUT

01:53:42.448 --> 01:53:43.583
WORKING WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT IN

01:53:43.650 --> 01:53:47.654
FACT MY OWN POLICE CHIEF. PORAC

01:53:47.720 --> 01:53:49.455
THE UNION THAT REPRESENTS

01:53:49.522 --> 01:53:52.325
POLICE OFFICERS WE'VE TRIED TO

01:53:52.392 --> 01:53:55.628
ENSURE THAT IT IS DONE IN A WAY

01:53:55.695 --> 01:53:57.630
THAT PROTECTS PEOPLE AT A

01:53:57.697 --> 01:54:00.333
PROTEST. TO SUGGEST THAT YOUR

01:54:00.400 --> 01:54:02.535
PROTEST IN BECAUSE OF A

01:54:02.602 --> 01:54:03.703
THOUSAND PEOPLE AND SOMEBODY

01:54:03.770 --> 01:54:04.871
OVER THERE THERE IS A WATER

01:54:04.938 --> 01:54:07.507
BOTTLE NEAR A POLICE OFFICER

01:54:07.574 --> 01:54:08.374
THAT THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO

01:54:08.441 --> 01:54:10.343
SHOOT INDISCRIMINATELY RUBBER

01:54:10.410 --> 01:54:11.844
BULLETS ALONG THE ENTIRE CROWD

01:54:11.911 --> 01:54:14.047
IS RIDICULOUS I HOPE WE ALL

01:54:14.113 --> 01:54:15.448
BELIEVE IN THE FIRST AMENDMENT

01:54:15.515 --> 01:54:17.450
AND NOT. TO BELIEVE THAT WE

01:54:17.517 --> 01:54:19.552
SHOULD BE ABLE TO HAVE THAT

01:54:19.619 --> 01:54:22.388
RIGHT AND SHOULDN'T BE TARGETED

01:54:22.455 --> 01:54:24.357
BECAUSE SOMEBODY IN THE CROWD.

01:54:24.424 --> 01:54:26.626
HURLED A PLASTIC BOTTLE

01:54:26.693 --> 01:54:28.027
UNFORTUNATELY THAT'S WHAT

01:54:28.094 --> 01:54:30.496
HAPPENED LAST SUMMER. IT WASN'T

01:54:30.563 --> 01:54:32.332
JUST IN SAN DIEGO WE SAW IT

01:54:32.398 --> 01:54:33.900
HAPPEN TIME AND TIME AGAIN IN

01:54:33.967 --> 01:54:35.535
LA AND MY COLLEAGUE FROM

01:54:35.602 --> 01:54:37.570
SACRAMENTO IS HERE WE SAW A

01:54:37.637 --> 01:54:39.372
YOUNG WOMAN LOSE HER EYE HERE

01:54:39.439 --> 01:54:41.074
IN SACRAMENTO WE SAW

01:54:41.140 --> 01:54:43.142
JOURNALISTS GET SHOT IN THE

01:54:43.209 --> 01:54:44.944
GROWING QUITE HONESTLY I DON'T

01:54:45.011 --> 01:54:46.879
WANT TO KNOW WHAT HE LOST. IN

01:54:46.946 --> 01:54:49.983
LONG BEACH. THIS IS SERIOUS.

01:54:50.049 --> 01:54:51.951
AND THESE ARE NOT TARGETED AT

01:54:52.018 --> 01:54:53.753
INDIVIDUALS WERE NECESSARILY

01:54:53.820 --> 01:54:56.522
DOING ANYTHING WRONG. IF IN

01:54:56.589 --> 01:54:57.790
FACT SOMEBODY IS DOING

01:54:57.857 --> 01:54:59.025
SOMETHING WRONG A POLICE

01:54:59.092 --> 01:55:00.693
OFFICERS HAVE THE RIGHT TO USE

01:55:00.760 --> 01:55:02.962
THESE LESS THAN LETHAL WEAPONS

01:55:03.029 --> 01:55:05.398
AGAINST. THE INDIVIDUAL TO STOP

01:55:05.465 --> 01:55:06.933
THE CHARGE TO STOP BEING

01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:09.235
TARGETED. BUT THIS IS ABOUT

01:55:09.302 --> 01:55:11.137
PEACEFUL PROTESTERS PEOPLE WHO

01:55:11.204 --> 01:55:12.538
SHOWED UP TO EXPRESS THEIR

01:55:12.605 --> 01:55:14.274
FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS. AND

01:55:14.340 --> 01:55:15.975
CAN'T DO SO BECAUSE THEY'RE IN

01:55:16.042 --> 01:55:17.577
FEAR OF THEIR OWN LIFE FROM

01:55:17.644 --> 01:55:18.711
SOMETHING THAT QUITE HONESTLY

01:55:18.778 --> 01:55:20.513
COULD TAKE THEIR LIFE WE CALL

01:55:20.580 --> 01:55:22.415
THEM LESS THAN LETHAL. BUT WE

01:55:22.482 --> 01:55:23.750
KNOW THAT THEY'VE ACTUALLY

01:55:23.816 --> 01:55:27.487
CAUSED TO DEATH BEFORE. SO I

01:55:27.553 --> 01:55:28.187
FEEL LIKE THIS IS A BALANCE

01:55:28.254 --> 01:55:30.657
BILL. OBVIOUSLY I'VE BEEN

01:55:30.723 --> 01:55:33.059
WORKING WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT.

01:55:33.126 --> 01:55:35.328
YOU BELIEVE THAT I I'M CREDIBLE

01:55:35.395 --> 01:55:37.096
TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THEIR

01:55:37.163 --> 01:55:37.697
NEUTRAL PORAC IN THE POLICE

01:55:37.764 --> 01:55:39.632
CHIEFS. BUT IT'S TIME THAT WE

01:55:39.699 --> 01:55:41.401
INSURE THE PEOPLE STILL HAVE

FOR COMPLEX DYNAMIC. AND OFTEN

03:48:45.478 --> 03:48:47.146
VERY VERY TRAGIC. FOR THAT

03:48:47.213 --> 03:48:48.714
REASON EXISTING LAW ALREADY

EXCESSIVE FORCES AND FLEXIBLE

03:49:07.567 --> 03:49:08.835
AND ALSO MAY BE VERY UNFAIR.

03:49:08.901 --> 03:49:09.869
THE USE OF FORCE THAT COUNTERS

03:49:09.936 --> 03:49:12.872
ARE CHAOTIC CONFUSING. AND VERY

03:49:12.939 --> 03:49:14.340
DYNAMIC THEY HAPPEN VERY VERY

03:49:14.407 --> 03:49:17.009
FAST WHEN MULTIPLE AGENCIES ARE

03:49:17.076 --> 03:49:18.544
INVOLVED WHEN OTHER OFFICERS

03:49:18.611 --> 03:49:20.246

DISCIPLINE OF OFFICERS FOR

MISCONDUCT. INCLUDING THE

03:49:27.386 --> 03:49:28.588
CREATION OF A SYSTEM THAT

03:49:28.654 --> 03:49:29.689
INCLUDES THE POTENTIAL FOR

03:49:29.755 --> 03:49:31.491
DECERTIFICATION FOR NON

CRIMINAL LACKS BUT I ALSO FOR A

03:49:35.061 --> 03:49:36.462
SUPPORT. ALLOWING A MEASURE OF

FAILS TO INTERCEDE RECEIVED THE

03:49:47.507 --> 03:49:47.940
SAME PENALTY BECAUSE THE

03:49:48.007 --> 03:49:50.076
OFFICER WHO USES EXCESSIVE

03:49:50.143 --> 03:49:52.879
FORCE IS TO INFLEXIBLE. INSTEAD

03:49:52.945 --> 03:49:55.281
WE SHOULD ALLOW POLICE OFFICERS.

03:49:55.348 --> 03:49:57.016
EMPLOY TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE

03:49:57.083 --> 03:50:00.686
FACTIONS. OF THE FAILURE TO

PENALTY SHOULD BE ALSO NOTHING

03:50:10.396 --> 03:50:11.330
IN THE BILL PROHIBITS US

SITUATIONS THAT OCCURRED PRIOR

03:50:19.071 --> 03:50:21.007
TO JANUARY FIRST I BELIEVE

03:50:21.073 --> 03:50:22.575

THE BY THE- PRESENTATION

03:50:41.427 --> 03:50:43.596
BECAUSE IT WAS IN PUBLIC SAFETY

03:50:43.663 --> 03:50:44.697
THAT WE REMOVED ACCESSORY TO A

03:50:44.764 --> 03:50:47.900
CRIME. I WAS VERY CLEAR AT THAT

03:50:47.967 --> 03:50:50.436
POINT THAT THERE WAS AN ELEMENT

03:50:50.503 --> 03:50:53.172
OF THE BILL THAT WAS COMING OUT.

03:50:53.239 --> 03:50:55.208

UNDERSTAND AS WELL. SO EASY TO

03:51:14.961 --> 03:51:17.063
SAY THAT EXISTS. BUT IT'S NOT

03:51:17.129 --> 03:51:20.399
IN STATUTES. I THINK IT'S ALSO

RARE IN APPROPRIATIONS AND I'LL

06:55:06.581 --> 06:55:08.583
EXPLAIN WHY THIS IS NOT JUST A

06:55:08.650 --> 06:55:10.085
PROBLEM WITH HOMELESS IT'S NOT

06:55:10.151 --> 06:55:11.586

URINATE INTO A- A WATER BOTTLE

BECAUSE THERE'S NOWHERE FOR

USE THE RESTROOM QUITE FRANKLY-

06:55:26.701 --> 06:55:28.937
THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT THAT. IS

06:55:29.004 --> 06:55:31.239
A GENDER SPECIFIC AND THAT MEN

06:55:31.306 --> 06:55:33.074

06:55:33.141 --> 06:55:34.042
THEMSELVESIN A WAY WOMEN

06:55:50.091 --> 06:55:51.626
THIS IS JUST THE START TO

06:55:51.693 --> 06:55:53.962
UNDERSTAND. WHAT THE RIGHT TO

06:55:54.029 --> 06:55:55.330
USE RESTROOM SHOULD BE

06:55:55.397 --> 06:55:57.032
