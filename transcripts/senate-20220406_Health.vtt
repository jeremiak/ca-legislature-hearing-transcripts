THIS FORWARD. SOME OF THE TWO

00:24:44.349 --> 00:24:45.283
THINGS THAT REALLY STOOD OUT FOR

00:24:45.350 --> 00:24:47.252
ME FROM THE OPPOSITION IS THE

00:24:47.319 --> 00:24:49.421
FEAR THAT. THE PATIENTS WILL

00:24:49.487 --> 00:24:52.023
SUFFER FROM THIS AND THEN THE

00:24:52.090 --> 00:24:53.625
OTHER THING I HEARD VERY CLEARLY

00:24:53.692 --> 00:24:54.492
WAS PEOPLE APPRECIATE YOUR

00:24:54.559 --> 00:24:56.561
WILLINGNESS TO CONTINUE TO WORK

00:24:56.628 --> 00:24:58.296
WITH THE OPPOSITION SO I GUESS

00:24:58.363 --> 00:24:59.631
MY QUESTION IS DO YOU SHARE SOME

00:24:59.698 --> 00:25:01.433
OF THE CONCERNS ABOUT. PATIENTS

00:25:01.499 --> 00:25:03.535
HAVING ACCESS TO MEDICATIONS AND

00:25:03.602 --> 00:25:05.070
ARE YOU COMMITTED TO CONTINUE TO

00:25:05.136 --> 00:25:07.172
WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION SO

00:25:07.239 --> 00:25:09.441
IT'S BECAUSE OF MY CONCERN WITH

00:25:09.507 --> 00:25:10.876
PATIENTS ACT HAVING ACCESS TO

00:25:10.942 --> 00:25:12.244
MEDICATION THAT I'M RUNNING THIS

00:25:12.310 --> 00:25:14.412
BILL- AND SO I CERTAINLY SHARE

00:25:14.479 --> 00:25:16.047
THAT CONCERN AND I THINK THAT

00:25:16.114 --> 00:25:17.382
YOU KNOW AS IS EVIDENCED IN THE

00:25:17.449 --> 00:25:19.050
COMMENTS TODAY. BUT ALSO IN THE

00:25:19.117 --> 00:25:20.218
AMENDMENTS THAT I'M TAKING I

00:25:20.285 --> 00:25:22.153
WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH

00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:23.021
OPPOSITION. THANK YOU AND I'D

00:25:23.088 --> 00:25:24.489

OF THE TESTIMONY IT'S AN

00:25:33.231 --> 00:25:35.300
IMPORTANT CONVERSATION TO HOUSE-

00:25:35.367 --> 00:25:36.968

00:25:37.035 --> 00:25:39.404
REALLY FOCUSED ON PATIENT SAFETY

00:25:39.471 --> 00:25:41.539
AND ACCESS BUT- I HAVE A COUPLE

00:25:41.606 --> 00:25:43.375
OF QUESTIONS IF I MAY ASK. I

00:25:43.441 --> 00:25:44.576
THINK IT'S OPPOSITION I KNOW

00:25:44.643 --> 00:25:46.044
THAT THE WORSE OUR CONCERNS

00:25:46.111 --> 00:25:48.346
EXPRESSED ABOUT. OB PATIENT

00:25:48.413 --> 00:25:50.615
SAFETY AND DIAL. AND THE

00:25:50.682 --> 00:25:53.051
DELIVERY AND QUALITY CONTROL I

00:25:53.118 --> 00:25:55.153
WOULD LIKE TO SEE IF THEY CAN GO

00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:56.688
A LITTLE FURTHER AND- HIGHLIGHT

00:25:56.755 --> 00:25:59.991
SOME OF THOSE MECHANISMS THAT WE

00:26:00.058 --> 00:26:03.428
USE. THANK YOU. MMHM THANK YOU

00:26:03.495 --> 00:26:04.296
VERY MUCH- SO SPECIALLY

00:26:04.362 --> 00:26:06.498
PHARMACIES ARE NO DIFFERENT A

00:26:06.564 --> 00:26:09.401
PART OF THE SUPPLY CHAIN OF ANY

00:26:09.467 --> 00:26:10.302
OTHER AS COMPARED TO OTHER

00:26:10.368 --> 00:26:12.904
SUPPLY CHAIN- MEMBER IN THIS

00:26:12.971 --> 00:26:14.839
INSTANCE THEY HAVE TO FOLLOW THE

00:26:14.906 --> 00:26:17.042
SAME DRUG- TRANSLATION HERE TO

00:26:17.108 --> 00:26:18.910
ACT UP PROVISIONS AND CONGRESS

00:26:18.977 --> 00:26:22.514
THEY ARE ALSO REQUIRED TO COVER-

00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:23.848
TO MEET U. S. P. UNITED STATES

00:26:23.915 --> 00:26:25.984
PHARMACOPEIA STANDARDS FOR A

00:26:26.051 --> 00:26:27.352
QUALITY AND PROCESSING OF

00:26:27.419 --> 00:26:30.121
PRESCRIPTIONS- THEY ALSO HAVE

00:26:30.188 --> 00:26:32.190
MULTIPLE ACCREDITATIONS THAT

00:26:32.257 --> 00:26:35.160
THEY MUST MAINTAIN- SO THESE ARE

00:26:35.226 --> 00:26:36.394
NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED ACCORDED

00:26:36.461 --> 00:26:38.463
ACCREDITATION BODIES. THAT

00:26:38.530 --> 00:26:40.598
EVALUATE AND GRANT CERTIFICATION

00:26:40.665 --> 00:26:42.267
OR ACCREDITATION FOR THESE-

00:26:42.334 --> 00:26:45.337
SERVICES SO THE NOTION THAT

00:26:45.403 --> 00:26:47.172
THESE KINDS OF THESE THESE

00:26:47.238 --> 00:26:50.275
VENDORS ARE SOMEHOW LESS SAFE IS

00:26:50.342 --> 00:26:53.011
FRANKLY UNTRUE BECAUSE IN FACT

00:26:53.078 --> 00:26:55.647
DEPENDING ON THE DRUG OFTENTIMES

00:26:55.714 --> 00:26:57.749
THE PROVIDERS AND THE HOSPITALS

00:26:57.816 --> 00:26:59.150
WILL BE ACQUIRING THEIR DRUG

00:26:59.217 --> 00:27:01.319
SUPPLY FROM THE SAME VENDOR FROM

00:27:01.386 --> 00:27:02.554
SPECIALTY PHARMACY THIS IS

00:27:02.620 --> 00:27:03.922
BECAUSE THERE ARE DIFFERENT FTA

00:27:03.989 --> 00:27:05.790
REQUIREMENTS FOR CERTAIN DRUGS.

00:27:05.857 --> 00:27:07.225
AND ALSO THE MANUFACTURERS MAY

00:27:07.292 --> 00:27:08.927
IMPOSE CERTAIN LIMITATIONS ON

00:27:08.994 --> 00:27:10.729
DISTRIBUTION OF THEIR PRODUCTS

00:27:10.795 --> 00:27:13.732
SO THEY MAY CHOOSE TO LIMIT THEM

00:27:13.798 --> 00:27:15.033
TO CERTAIN SPECIALLY PHARMACIES

00:27:15.100 --> 00:27:17.535
BECAUSE IN FACT THEY ARE

00:27:17.602 --> 00:27:19.371
COMFORTABLE THAT THE SPECIALLY

00:27:19.437 --> 00:27:22.941
PHARMACY THAT IS PROVIDING THE-PRODUCT EXPENSING THE PRODUCT IS

00:27:23.008 --> 00:27:24.009
IN THE BEST POSITION TO MAINTAIN

00:27:24.075 --> 00:27:25.443
QUALITY STANDARDS AND

00:27:25.510 --> 00:27:28.013
DISTRIBUTION- I CAN ALSO SPEAK

00:27:28.079 --> 00:27:29.581
FROM EXPERIENCE HAVING VISITED A

00:27:29.647 --> 00:27:31.583
NUMBER OF DIFFERENT- FACILITIES

00:27:31.649 --> 00:27:34.319
THAT- THESE ARE JUST THROWN IN

00:27:34.386 --> 00:27:36.121
AN ENVELOPE OF THESE TRUCKS ARE

00:27:36.187 --> 00:27:37.255
NOT THROWN IN AN ENVELOPE AND

00:27:37.322 --> 00:27:39.691
SHIPPED TO A LOCATION- THEY ARE

00:27:39.758 --> 00:27:40.959
VERY SOPHISTICATED PROCESSES

00:27:41.026 --> 00:27:42.927
INVOLVED ESPECIALLY FOR-

00:27:42.994 --> 00:27:44.129
SHIPMENTS THAT ARE SENT FROM

00:27:44.195 --> 00:27:45.663
ACROSS THE COUNTRY LIKE I THINK

00:27:45.730 --> 00:27:46.398
ANOTHER WITNESS HAD MENTIONED

00:27:46.464 --> 00:27:49.501
THE YORK- WHAT HAPPENS IS THE

00:27:49.567 --> 00:27:50.135
SPECIALLY PHARMACIES WHEN THEY

00:27:50.201 --> 00:27:52.570
RECEIVE AN ORDER. WILL RUN A

00:27:52.637 --> 00:27:53.538
SERIES OF SOPHISTICATED

00:27:53.605 --> 00:27:57.909
ALGORITHMS TO DETERMINE. THE

00:27:57.976 --> 00:27:59.010
PATH OF TRANSIT. LITERALLY THREE

00:27:59.077 --> 00:28:01.112
OBVIOUSLY ERROR OR GROUND THEY

00:28:01.179 --> 00:28:03.014
WILL PACK ENOUGH- INSULATION AND

00:28:03.081 --> 00:28:05.717
OR OTHER PROTECTIVE MEASURES IN

00:28:05.784 --> 00:28:07.986
A PACKAGE TO ENSURE NOT ONLY

00:28:08.053 --> 00:28:09.454
WILL THE PRODUCT BE SAFE SAFE

00:28:09.521 --> 00:28:11.089
AND STABLE BY THE TIME IT

00:28:11.156 --> 00:28:12.590
ARRIVED AT THE LOCATION. BUT

00:28:12.657 --> 00:28:14.025
THAT IT WILL ALSO BE ABLE TO

00:28:14.092 --> 00:28:15.326
WITHSTAND SITTING OUT IN THE

00:28:15.393 --> 00:28:17.495
ELEMENTS FOR. UP TO A COUPLE OF

00:28:17.562 --> 00:28:19.130
DAYS IN SOME CASES SO AGAIN

00:28:19.197 --> 00:28:20.465
IT'LL DEPEND ON THE DRUG BUT

00:28:20.532 --> 00:28:22.400
UTMOST CARE IS TAKEN HERE AND-

00:28:22.467 --> 00:28:23.802
ANOTHER THING I'LL MENTION AS

00:28:23.868 --> 00:28:26.471
PURCHASED SAFETY. IT IS VERY

00:28:26.538 --> 00:28:28.540
MUCH AGAINST THE INTEREST OF

00:28:28.606 --> 00:28:29.874
ANYONE INVOLVED ESPECIALLY

00:28:29.941 --> 00:28:31.142
ESPECIALLY PHARMACIES TO RISK

00:28:31.209 --> 00:28:33.211
SPOILAGE OR WASTE OF THESE

00:28:33.278 --> 00:28:35.046
PRODUCTS THEY ARE VERY

00:28:35.113 --> 00:28:36.247
EXPENSIVE. AND IF THE DRUG IS

00:28:36.314 --> 00:28:37.215
SOMEHOW COMPROMISED BY THE TIME

00:28:37.282 --> 00:28:40.618
AND RIGHTS THE- THE CLINIC OR

00:28:40.685 --> 00:28:42.053
THE PROVIDER. THE LOSS OF THAT

00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:43.288
PRODUCT IS ON THE SPECIALLY

00:28:43.354 --> 00:28:45.256
PHARMACY SO IT'S NOT A VERY

00:28:45.323 --> 00:28:46.558
SUSTAINABLE MODEL. FOR THEM TO

00:28:46.624 --> 00:28:47.992
OPERATE IF THEY'RE LOSING TENS

00:28:48.059 --> 00:28:49.060
OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS OF

00:28:49.127 --> 00:28:51.162
DRUGS. ON A FREQUENT BASIS IT

00:28:51.229 --> 00:28:54.065
JUST IS NOT HAPPENING SO. I

00:28:54.132 --> 00:28:55.333
THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION I'M

00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:57.135
HAPPY TO ANSWER MORE. THANK YOU-

00:28:57.202 --> 00:28:59.237
AND I JUST WANT TO GO A LITTLE

00:28:59.304 --> 00:29:01.172
FURTHER BECAUSE I KNOW THAT THE

00:29:01.239 --> 00:29:01.973
SPECIALTY- PHARMACIES GET THE

00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:03.808
DRUGS AND THEN FROM MY TO HEARD.

00:29:03.875 --> 00:29:05.977
TESTIMONY SOMEONE SAID IT. AND

00:29:06.044 --> 00:29:07.178
IT GOES TO THE PATIENT AND THEN

00:29:07.245 --> 00:29:09.314
THE PATIENT. BRINGS IT TO THE

00:29:09.380 --> 00:29:11.349
HOSPITAL SO. CAN YOU HELP ME

00:29:11.416 --> 00:29:12.817
UNDERSTAND HOW DO YOU ENSURE

00:29:12.884 --> 00:29:15.753
THAT THE PATIENT. IS EQUIPPED TO

00:29:15.820 --> 00:29:18.456
HANDLE IT AND GET THE MEDICATION

00:29:18.523 --> 00:29:20.825
WHEN THEY NEED TO GET IT TO THE

00:29:20.892 --> 00:29:21.459
HOSPITAL'S. OF COURSE THANK YOU

00:29:21.526 --> 00:29:24.796
CENTER OF YOUR QUESTION. SO THE-

00:29:24.863 --> 00:29:26.731
THE HEALTH PLAN. WORKING WITH

00:29:26.798 --> 00:29:28.733
THEIR- SOMETIMES AS WITH AN

00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:31.102
INTEGRATED AS A PBM OR

00:29:31.169 --> 00:29:32.704
INTEGRATED SPECIALLY PHARMACY.

00:29:32.770 --> 00:29:33.972
WAR WITH THE SEPARATELY

00:29:34.038 --> 00:29:36.441
CONTRACTED ENTITY THAT WILL DO

00:29:36.508 --> 00:29:39.277
THAT FOR THEM- THEY- ARE ABLE TO

00:29:39.344 --> 00:29:40.578
DETERMINE THROUGH A NUMBER OF

00:29:40.645 --> 00:29:42.447
DIFFERENT DATA. FACTORS WHETHER

00:29:42.514 --> 00:29:44.115
OR NOT CERTAIN PATIENTS ARE.

00:29:44.182 --> 00:29:46.551
BETTER CANDIDATES FOR EASY

00:29:46.618 --> 00:29:47.952
REFERENCE BROWN BAGGING WHICH IS

00:29:48.019 --> 00:29:49.454
WHEN THE DRUG IS SENT TO THE

00:29:49.521 --> 00:29:51.055
PATIENT A PATIENT PRESIDENT. IT

00:29:51.122 --> 00:29:53.558
DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE TO RISK

00:29:53.625 --> 00:29:54.392
THE SAFETY OF THE PATIENT OR THE

00:29:54.459 --> 00:29:58.229
DRUG. TO USE THAT METHOD. IF

00:29:58.296 --> 00:29:59.197
THEY'RE NOT A GOOD CANDIDATE

00:29:59.264 --> 00:30:00.732
FORCIBLE CONSIDERING A NUMBER OF

00:30:00.798 --> 00:30:02.433
DIFFERENT FACTORS TO. KNOW ARE

00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:03.468
THEY PHYSICALLY CAPABLE OF

00:30:03.535 --> 00:30:05.003
HANDLING IT IS THE DRUG

00:30:05.069 --> 00:30:06.171
SOMETHING THAT COULD BE KEPT IN

00:30:06.237 --> 00:30:07.805
THE REFRIGERATOR. NOT SOMETHING

00:30:07.872 --> 00:30:09.607
THAT NEEDS SPECIAL COLD CHAIN

00:30:09.674 --> 00:30:12.310
HANDLING- OTHER FACTORS ARE THEY

00:30:12.377 --> 00:30:13.645
MENTALLY COGNIZANT DEPENDING ON

00:30:13.711 --> 00:30:15.280
THEIR CLAIMS HISTORY ARE THEY-

00:30:15.346 --> 00:30:16.080
YOU KNOW THE COGNITIVELY

00:30:16.147 --> 00:30:17.415
IMPAIRED OTHER OTHER CAT

00:30:17.482 --> 00:30:20.251
FACTORS. SO THIS ISN'T APPLY TO

00:30:20.318 --> 00:30:22.253
JUST ANY PATIENT OKAY. IT'S ONLY

00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:24.355
APPLIED IN THE CASE OF BROWN BAG

00:30:24.422 --> 00:30:26.391
ESPECIALLY TO THOSE PAGES THAT

00:30:26.457 --> 00:30:27.325
ARE BEST POSITIONED TO BE ABLE

00:30:27.392 --> 00:30:29.527
TO HANDLE THE WRONG MEDICATION.

00:30:29.594 --> 00:30:31.129
AS FOR WHITE BACKING. UNDER

00:30:31.196 --> 00:30:32.530
NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES IF THERE'S

00:30:32.597 --> 00:30:35.466
COOPERATION WITH THE PRESCRIBER.

00:30:35.533 --> 00:30:36.801
WHO WILL BE ACEPTING THE

00:30:36.868 --> 00:30:38.403
SHIPMENT AND THEN DISPENSING IT

00:30:38.469 --> 00:30:40.104
THE PICTURE WILL HAVE NO IDEA

00:30:40.171 --> 00:30:41.639
WHERE THE DRUG CAME FROM. IT

00:30:41.706 --> 00:30:42.740
SHOULDN'T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE

00:30:42.807 --> 00:30:44.008
WHETHER COMES FROM THE POSITIONS

00:30:44.075 --> 00:30:46.811
STOCK OR IF IT COMES FROM

00:30:46.878 --> 00:30:47.612
SHIPMENT. THAT CAME IN EARLIER

00:30:47.679 --> 00:30:50.248
THAT DAY OR THE DAY BEFORE. SO

00:30:50.315 --> 00:30:51.382
YOU SHOULD BE COMPLETELY

00:30:51.449 --> 00:30:55.086
SEAMLESS. THANK YOU L. YOU KNOW

00:30:55.153 --> 00:30:56.821
WHEN I HEAR THE DISCUSSION TODAY

00:30:56.888 --> 00:30:59.090
I MEAN I GUESS IT'S IMPORTANT IS

00:30:59.157 --> 00:31:00.825
A COMPLICATED ISSUE BUT ICAN

00:31:00.892 --> 00:31:02.460
SEE WHY THERE IS A PRACTICE OF

00:31:02.527 --> 00:31:04.095
THIRD PARTY VENDORS AND IT HAS

00:31:04.162 --> 00:31:06.497
TO DO WITH WITH COST SAVINGS IN

00:31:06.564 --> 00:31:08.233
AND FOR ME THE COST IS A REAL

00:31:08.299 --> 00:31:10.401
BIG BIG CONCERN BUT- I REALLY

00:31:10.468 --> 00:31:11.569
WOULD LIKE TO SEE FURTHER

00:31:11.636 --> 00:31:12.770
DISCUSSIONS GEARED TOWARDS

00:31:12.837 --> 00:31:15.173
REDUCING THE COST OF MEDICATIONS

00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:16.441
FOR PATIENTS I THINK TO ME

00:31:16.507 --> 00:31:17.408
THAT'S FROM STRUGGLING WITH

00:31:17.475 --> 00:31:20.178
BECAUSE- AGAIN THAT'S THE REASON

00:31:20.245 --> 00:31:21.813
THEY USE THE THIRD PARTY VENDORS

00:31:21.879 --> 00:31:23.414
AND I RECOGNIZE THAT THEY NOT

00:31:23.481 --> 00:31:25.984
BE. FOR HOSPITALS AND MAY NOT BE

00:31:26.050 --> 00:31:27.118
FISCALLY FEASIBLE SINCE THEY

00:31:27.185 --> 00:31:28.553
HAVE SUCH GREAT OVERHEAD AND

00:31:28.620 --> 00:31:29.654
QUALITY CONTROL I GUESS

00:31:29.721 --> 00:31:31.389
IMPLEMENTATION AND THINGS THAT

00:31:31.456 --> 00:31:33.424
THEY HAVE TO PAY OUT SO I

00:31:33.491 --> 00:31:34.492
RECOGNIZE THAT THAT MAY NOT BE

00:31:34.559 --> 00:31:36.628
FEASIBLE BRINGING THE COST DOWN-

00:31:36.694 --> 00:31:38.062
EQUAL TO THAT OF SPECIALTY

00:31:38.129 --> 00:31:40.131
PHARMACIES BUT I DO WANT

00:31:40.198 --> 00:31:42.133
PATIENTS TO WIN AND I THINK ALL

00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:43.368
OF US ARE HERE BECAUSE WE WANT

00:31:43.434 --> 00:31:46.337
PATIENTS TO WIN. AND SO- I'M NOT

00:31:46.404 --> 00:31:47.572
NECESSARILY SURE RIGHT AT THIS

00:31:47.639 --> 00:31:49.307
MOMENT THAT EITHER SIDE IS

00:31:49.374 --> 00:31:52.010
SATISFACTORY TO ME- ON ONE HAND

00:31:52.076 --> 00:31:53.478
WE HAVE THE PATIENT SAFETY IN

00:31:53.544 --> 00:31:54.879
TERMS OF LIKE STORING AND

00:31:54.946 --> 00:31:58.216
HANDLING AND MAKING SURE THAT

00:31:58.283 --> 00:31:59.117
PATIENTS GET THE MEDICATION.

00:31:59.183 --> 00:32:00.785
RIPPLED WITH YOU KNOW TIMELY

00:32:00.852 --> 00:32:02.053
ACCESS. BUT ON THE OTHER HAND WE

00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:03.421
HAVE THESE HIGH PRICES THAT MADE

00:32:03.488 --> 00:32:05.590
ME FAMILIES. AND FINANCIAL

00:32:05.657 --> 00:32:07.759
DISTRESS AND IT'S A REAL CONCERN

00:32:07.825 --> 00:32:09.627
YOU KNOW WHEN THE PRICES CAN BE.

00:32:09.694 --> 00:32:12.463
EXTREMELY HIGH. END SOUL YOU

00:32:12.530 --> 00:32:14.465
KNOW I APPRECIATE THAT THE-

00:32:14.532 --> 00:32:16.768
SENATOR. HER TESTIMONY SAYING

00:32:16.834 --> 00:32:18.469
THAT SHE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK

00:32:18.536 --> 00:32:20.104
WITH WITH THE WITH THE

00:32:20.171 --> 00:32:21.139
OPPOSITION. I MEAN I DO BELIEVE

00:32:21.205 --> 00:32:22.774
THAT THERE IS A MIDDLE GROUND

00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:24.242
SOMEWHERE I'M NOT SURE WHAT THAT

00:32:24.309 --> 00:32:25.977
MIDDLE GROUND IS. BUT I THINK

00:32:26.044 --> 00:32:27.512
THAT THERE'S OPPORTUNITIES TO

00:32:27.578 --> 00:32:28.513
CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD THIS

00:32:28.579 --> 00:32:30.682
BILL. AGAIN BUT I REALLY WANTED

00:32:30.748 --> 00:32:32.850
TO BE FOCUS ON HOW DO WE-

00:32:32.917 --> 00:32:34.085
PROVIDE THAT ACCESS BUT ALSO

00:32:34.152 --> 00:32:36.020
ENSURE THAT THE PRICING IS RIGHT

00:32:36.087 --> 00:32:37.588
AND THAT THESE FAMILIES.

00:32:37.655 --> 00:32:38.990
ESPECIALLY THOSE THAT DON'T HAVE

00:32:39.057 --> 00:32:40.158
HEALTH INSURANCE. ARE NOT LEFT

00:32:40.224 --> 00:32:42.560
HOLDING THE BAG SO TO SPEAK- AND

00:32:42.627 --> 00:32:44.128
THAT THEY ARE ABLE TO FEEL

00:32:44.195 --> 00:32:46.130
CONFIDENT THAT THEY CAN GET THIS

00:32:46.197 --> 00:32:47.165
MEDICATION AND THEY'RE NOT GONNA

00:32:47.231 --> 00:32:49.334
BREAK THE BANK CELL. I ALSO WANT

00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:50.401
TO THINK OUT THERE BECAUSE I

00:32:50.468 --> 00:32:52.804
KNOW SHE TOOK THE AMENDMENTS

00:32:52.870 --> 00:32:53.438
WHICH IS IMPORTANT. BUT AGAIN I

00:32:53.504 --> 00:32:54.205
THINK THERE'S STILL MORE

00:32:54.272 --> 00:32:55.640
CONVERSATIONS TO BE HAD AND I

00:32:55.707 --> 00:32:57.775
WOULD LIKE TO SEE A LITTLE BIT

MORE COLLABORATION ON BOTH

00:32:58.843 --> 00:33:00.011
SIDES. BUT I WILL SUPPORT THE

00:33:00.078 --> 00:33:01.312
BILL BECAUSE I THINK IT'S AN

00:33:01.379 --> 00:33:02.880
IMPORTANT CONVERSATION TO HAVE.

00:33:02.947 --> 00:33:03.581
AND I'M CONFIDENT THAT BOTH

00:33:03.648 --> 00:33:05.249
SIDES EQUALLY ARE HEARING THAT

00:33:05.316 --> 00:33:06.818

TAKING THE AMENDMENTS- WE DID

00:33:24.435 --> 00:33:26.170
TRY TO STRIKE A MIDDLE GROUND.

00:33:26.237 --> 00:33:27.505
MAYBE IT'S NOT THE FINAL MIDDLE

00:33:27.572 --> 00:33:29.574
GROUND- WHERE. WE CERTAINLY

00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:32.477

PLACE RIGHT TO GET TREATMENT.

00:33:44.589 --> 00:33:46.557
AND THE MEDICATION IS NOT THERE.

00:33:46.624 --> 00:33:48.793
RIGHT- IT'S UP. TO THAT'S A

00:33:48.860 --> 00:33:50.161
PROBLEM THAT THAT SAYS THAT THE

00:33:50.228 --> 00:33:52.397
COST TO THE PATIENT THAT'S A

00:33:52.463 --> 00:33:53.364
COSTLY FOR MEMBERS FOR ME THAT

00:33:53.431 --> 00:33:55.700
THAT. THE COST OF THE PATIENT

OVERLY RESTRICT THE ABILITY OF.

00:34:10.314 --> 00:34:11.783
THE PLAN AGAIN TO ADDRESS THE

00:34:11.849 --> 00:34:13.818
FINANCIAL COSTS TO. IF THEY CAN

00:34:13.885 --> 00:34:16.554

THE MEDICATION IN. THE

00:34:17.188 --> 00:34:18.489
PREPARATORY MATTER TO SAFE

00:34:18.556 --> 00:34:20.892
MANNER THAT HE COULD AT. THAT

00:34:20.958 --> 00:34:21.959
THAT THERE'S AN ALTERNATIVE SO

00:34:22.026 --> 00:34:24.929
THAT- SO THAT THEY DIDN'T

00:34:24.996 --> 00:34:25.530
ACTUALLY HAVE. THEY COULD USE

ANOTHER PHARMACY AND SO WE TRY

00:34:27.265 --> 00:34:28.399

CONTINUING LEGAL EDUCATION

01:21:48.270 --> 01:21:50.472
SOMETIMES THERE WERE SUBJECTS

THAT YOU THAT YOU DON'T NEED A

01:21:52.307 --> 01:21:53.408
LAWYER WASN'T RELEVANT THERE

01:21:53.475 --> 01:21:55.277
WERE OTHER PEOPLE IF SOMEONE'S

HARASSMENT ISN'T THAT DOESN'T

01:21:59.347 --> 01:22:00.548
HAVE TO BE. A LAWYER AND THE

01:22:00.615 --> 01:22:02.083
SAME IS TRUE IN MEDICAL

01:22:02.150 --> 01:22:03.551
EDUCATION AS A WHOLE IT DEPENDS

01:22:03.618 --> 01:22:06.554
ON WHAT IT IS AND IF A- YOU KNOW

01:22:06.621 --> 01:22:08.390
WITH SOMEONE WHO IS A- SAID

TRANS PERSON. IS GOING TO TALK

01:22:11.126 --> 01:22:12.494
TO PHYSICIANS ABOUT THE

01:22:12.560 --> 01:22:14.262
EXPERIENCE OF TRANS PATIENTS AND

01:22:14.329 --> 01:22:15.063
HOW TO BE SENSITIVE AND

01:22:15.130 --> 01:22:16.598
SUPPORTIVE BUT DOESN'T NEED TO

01:22:16.665 --> 01:22:18.566
BE A PHYSICIAN FOR EXAMPLE

01:22:18.633 --> 01:22:19.968
TWENTY SAMPLE OF ONE COMPONENT.

01:22:20.035 --> 01:22:25.140
OF TRAINING. A SUMMONS AND THIS

01:22:30.645 --> 01:22:31.479
RIGHT THAT HEARING ABOUT

EXPERIENCES CAN BE HELPFUL IN

01:22:32.614 --> 01:22:33.982
SAYING SO THAT PHYSICIANS ARE

01:22:34.049 --> 01:22:36.151
MINDFUL. WHEN THEY TREAT TGI

01:22:36.217 --> 01:22:37.819

TESTIMONY TODAY WE HEARD A THEME

01:23:17.392 --> 01:23:18.927

COUNTRY SO BECAUSE OF THAT THERE

01:23:41.316 --> 01:23:43.585
THERE'S NO ACCREDITATION BODY

01:23:43.651 --> 01:23:44.586

FIRST STATE TO DO THIS. I'M PART

01:23:48.256 --> 01:23:52.093
OF THE REASON THAT THIS BILL-

01:23:52.160 --> 01:23:53.661

01:24:24.426 --> 01:24:27.829
AND I'M PROUD THAT WE ARE. WELL

01:24:27.896 --> 01:24:30.265
OKAY SO I GUESS YOU KNOW FROM

01:24:30.331 --> 01:24:32.300
WHERE I SIT IT SOUNDS LIKE IT'S

01:24:32.367 --> 01:24:34.269
A BIT OF A WORK IN PROGRESS

01:24:34.335 --> 01:24:34.836
BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T REALLY

01:24:34.903 --> 01:24:37.405
IDENTIFIED WHO IS QUALIFIED TO

01:24:37.472 --> 01:24:39.574
DO THIS TYPE OF TRAINING OR WHO-

01:24:39.641 --> 01:24:46.714
WILL DO IT BUT THE BILL DOES.

01:24:46.781 --> 01:24:48.049
MAKE IT- A- TO NOT PROVIDE THIS

01:24:48.116 --> 01:24:52.253
. SO IT I FEEL A LITTLE LEGWORK

01:24:52.320 --> 01:24:54.389
I DON'T THINK IT'S A CRIME IT

01:24:54.456 --> 01:24:55.290
WOULD BE REFERRED TO PUBLIC

01:24:55.356 --> 01:24:57.091
SAFETY COMMITTEE OF OR I DON'T

01:24:57.158 --> 01:24:58.426
WELL I UNDERSTAND THAT BUT WERE

01:24:58.493 --> 01:25:00.295
VOTING ON WHAT'S BEFORE SAYING I

01:25:00.361 --> 01:25:01.329
THINK WE HAVE TO TAKE INTO

01:25:01.396 --> 01:25:02.397
CONSIDERATION EVERYTHING THAT'S

01:25:02.464 --> 01:25:03.364
IN THE ANALYSIS SOMEONE AND

01:25:03.431 --> 01:25:05.266
THINGS IT'S IN THE ANALYSIS IS

01:25:05.333 --> 01:25:07.735
ON THE FACT THAT YOU YOU KNOW FM

01:25:07.802 --> 01:25:10.371
A PROVIDER COULD GET INTO SOME

01:25:10.438 --> 01:25:12.340
TROUBLE AND E FINE A LARGE

01:25:12.407 --> 01:25:14.876
AMOUNT OF MONEY IF THEY DON'T

01:25:14.943 --> 01:25:19.380
PROVIDE- THIS TRAINING SO- WELL

01:25:19.447 --> 01:25:20.849
IF SOMETHING IS. WELL FIRST OF

01:25:20.915 --> 01:25:23.551
ALL AGAIN. WHAT OKAY AMENDED.

01:25:23.618 --> 01:25:25.253
BUT YES- WHAT WE DO MANDATE

01:25:25.320 --> 01:25:26.254
THINGS LIKE TRAINING YOU HAVE

01:25:26.321 --> 01:25:28.623
TO. DO IT AND THAT'S THAT'S THE

01:25:28.690 --> 01:25:30.592
PURPOSE OF A RIGHT BUT WE DON'T

01:25:30.658 --> 01:25:31.893
ENDORSE WE DON'T YET KNOW WHO'S

01:25:31.960 --> 01:25:33.361
QUALIFIED TO EVEN DO THIS

01:25:33.428 --> 01:25:37.499
TRAINING SO- MY FINAL. QUESTION

01:25:37.565 --> 01:25:45.206
WOULD BE- WHAT IF THE. MEDICAL

01:25:45.273 --> 01:25:48.276
PROVIDER HAS A DIFFERENT

01:25:48.343 --> 01:25:53.348
EVIDENCE BASED. OPINION DAN THE

01:25:53.414 --> 01:25:55.717
COMPETENCY TRAINERS LIKE WHAT IF

01:25:55.783 --> 01:25:57.685
WHAT IF THEY'RE NOT MATCHING UP

01:25:57.752 --> 01:25:59.721
WHAT I MEAN WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT

01:25:59.787 --> 01:26:00.955
THE MEDICAL PROVIDER HAS TO

01:26:01.022 --> 01:26:02.390
DEFER TO THE OPINION OF THE

01:26:02.457 --> 01:26:04.225
COMPETENCY TRAINER EVEN THOUGH

01:26:04.292 --> 01:26:06.694
ONE HAS GONE TO MEDICAL SCHOOL

01:26:06.761 --> 01:26:08.830
THE OTHER LIKELY HAS NOT. SO ARE

01:26:08.897 --> 01:26:10.465
YOU REFERRING TO RELIGIOUS

01:26:10.532 --> 01:26:13.167
OBJECTIONS TO TREAT NO PEOPLE NO

01:26:13.234 --> 01:26:15.036
BY THAT I DON'T KNOW WHAT

01:26:15.103 --> 01:26:16.604
YOU'RE- REFERRING TO BECAUSE WE

01:26:16.671 --> 01:26:18.840
HEAR THAT A LOT ABOUT- BY.

01:26:18.907 --> 01:26:19.841
HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS WHO FOR

01:26:19.908 --> 01:26:21.509
RELIGIOUS REASONS DON'T WANT TO

01:26:21.576 --> 01:26:24.012
TREAT LGBTQ PEOPLE. AND SURVEYS

01:26:24.078 --> 01:26:25.647
THEREFORE THE PLAN- NO I'M NOT

01:26:25.713 --> 01:26:27.715
AN EXEMPTION WHICH I DON'T AGREE

01:26:27.782 --> 01:26:29.117
WITH. NO I'M STE- NO I DIDN'T

01:26:29.183 --> 01:26:32.620
MEAN SOMEBODY WHO- I MEAN YOU

01:26:32.687 --> 01:26:34.656
KNOW A PHYSICIAN WHO MEETS WITH

01:26:34.722 --> 01:26:36.958
THE PATIENT AND HAS A DISCUSSION

01:26:37.025 --> 01:26:39.861
ABOUT- ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF

01:26:39.928 --> 01:26:41.396
TRANSITIONING OR EVEN JUST IN

01:26:41.462 --> 01:26:43.031
THE INITIAL STAGES LIKE. THE

01:26:43.097 --> 01:26:46.267
WITNESS WHO TESTIFIED TODAY-

01:26:46.334 --> 01:26:47.969
THAT YOU KNOW THE PHYSICIAN MAY.

01:26:48.036 --> 01:26:49.537
LISTENED EVERYTHING AND THINK

01:26:49.604 --> 01:26:51.773
YOU KNOW I'M NOT SURE THAT THIS

01:26:51.839 --> 01:26:57.478
PERSON IS- IS READY- TO MOVE

01:26:57.545 --> 01:27:00.048
PERHAPS TO THE NEXT STEP. SOME

01:27:00.114 --> 01:27:03.084
MORE- YOU KNOW DISCUSSION

01:27:03.151 --> 01:27:04.485
PERHAPS NEEDS TO TAKE PLACE AND

01:27:04.552 --> 01:27:05.820
SO WHAT IF THE COMPETENCY

01:27:05.887 --> 01:27:08.022
TRAINER SAYS NO THANK THAT'S

01:27:08.089 --> 01:27:09.390
THAT'S NOT HOW WE'RE GOING TO DO

01:27:09.457 --> 01:27:11.092
THIS THAT'S NOT THE WAY THE

01:27:11.159 --> 01:27:13.061
SYSTEM IS TO BE DONE I DON'T

01:27:13.127 --> 01:27:14.896
THINK SO THE COMPANY TRADE THIS

01:27:14.963 --> 01:27:16.664
COMPETENCY IF THERE. WAS ONE

01:27:16.731 --> 01:27:18.433
THERE ARE TRAININGS AND STANDARD

01:27:18.499 --> 01:27:20.535
WHEN THEIR MINDS ARE FORMULATED

01:27:20.602 --> 01:27:22.971
IT'S NOT ABOUT LIKE THIS IS HOW

01:27:23.037 --> 01:27:24.639
YOU PRACTICE MEDICINE IN TERMS

01:27:24.706 --> 01:27:27.075
OF LIKE YOU THIS IS WHEN YOU DO

01:27:27.141 --> 01:27:28.343
A PROCEDURE OR HOW YOU DO A

01:27:28.409 --> 01:27:30.612
PROCEDURE PHYSICIANS GET TRAINED

01:27:30.678 --> 01:27:31.779
AND PROVIDING GENDER AFFIRMING

01:27:31.846 --> 01:27:34.949
CARE AND NOT EVERY POSITION. IS

01:27:35.016 --> 01:27:37.986
TRAINED TO DO THAT AND THAT'S

01:27:38.052 --> 01:27:39.287
ONE OF THE REASONS THE OTHER

01:27:39.354 --> 01:27:41.489
PART OF THIS BILL IS REQUIRING

01:27:41.556 --> 01:27:42.190
THAT HEALTH PLANS IN THEIR

01:27:42.256 --> 01:27:44.759
NETWORK DIRECTORIES IDENTIFY WHO

01:27:44.826 --> 01:27:46.661
WERE THE PHYSICIANS THAT PROVIDE

01:27:46.728 --> 01:27:48.496
GENDER AFFIRMING CARE TO TRANS

01:27:48.563 --> 01:27:50.632
PEOPLE- DON'T HAVE TO GAS AND

01:27:50.698 --> 01:27:51.799
DON'T HAVE TO MAKE A THOUSAND

01:27:51.866 --> 01:27:53.434
PHONE CALLS THAT THEY CAN

01:27:53.501 --> 01:27:54.869
ACTUALLY SEE HERE THE PEOPLE WHO

01:27:54.936 --> 01:27:57.071
AGREE TO THAT WHO HAVE BEEN

01:27:57.138 --> 01:27:59.874
TRAINED- TO DO THAT. SO THIS IS

01:27:59.941 --> 01:28:01.676
ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT WHEN

01:28:01.743 --> 01:28:03.478
HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS ARE

01:28:03.544 --> 01:28:05.913
PROVIDING HEALTH CARE SERVICES-

01:28:05.980 --> 01:28:07.382
BUT THEY'RE DOING IT IN A WAY

01:28:07.448 --> 01:28:08.883
THAT UNDERSTANDS A TRANS PEOPLE

01:28:08.950 --> 01:28:10.752
EXIST A THIRD TITLE TO RESPECT

01:28:10.818 --> 01:28:15.390
THIS IS HOW YOU INTERACT. WITH

01:28:15.456 --> 01:28:18.493
THEM- AND SO FORTH- OKAY WELL- I

01:28:18.559 --> 01:28:21.362
THINK THAT'S- I THINK THAT'S ALL

01:28:21.429 --> 01:28:23.131
I HAVE RIGHT NOW THANK YOU

01:28:23.197 --> 01:28:27.802

HAD TO DO MY CME FOR MY LICENSE-

01:28:33.841 --> 01:28:35.309
BY CONTINUING EDUCATIONS

01:28:35.376 --> 01:28:38.746
DISCOURTESY USE- WAS ON A BILL

01:28:38.813 --> 01:28:40.948

01:28:41.015 --> 01:28:43.084
BODY HE WAS ON A SUICIDE AND SO-

01:28:43.151 --> 01:28:44.519

DO RIGHT WE PASS BILLS ABOUT

01:28:46.087 --> 01:28:48.256
WHAT WE THINK PROFESSIONALS CAN

01:28:48.322 --> 01:28:49.290
KNOW ABOUT OF THE WE SHOULD

01:28:49.357 --> 01:28:51.592
THINK THEY SHOULD KNOW MORE. AND

01:28:51.659 --> 01:28:53.027
THEN WE TRUST- THEIR

01:28:53.094 --> 01:28:55.596
PROFESSIONAL BODIES TO DEVELOP

01:28:55.663 --> 01:28:57.098
THOSE AND I THINK IT'S A GOOD

01:28:57.165 --> 01:28:59.300
IDEA YOU ALSO BRING TOGETHER A

01:28:59.367 --> 01:29:01.402
GROUP TO LOOK AT IT SO CENTER

TO BEGIN ANY KIND OF

01:29:12.447 --> 01:29:13.614
TRANSITIONING PROCESS THEY HAVE

KINDS OF EVALUATIONS THAT PEOPLE

01:30:37.131 --> 01:30:39.534
RECEIVE- WHEN THEY ARE

01:30:39.600 --> 01:30:41.636
CONSIDERING- TRANSITIONING. OF

01:30:41.702 --> 01:30:43.404
COURSE THIS BILL THIS BILL DOES

01:30:43.471 --> 01:30:47.308
NOT DEFINE. WHAT MEDICAL CARE IS

01:30:47.375 --> 01:30:50.511
DOES NOT- IT THIS BILL IS ABOUT

01:30:50.578 --> 01:30:53.815
ABOUT PROTOCOLS AND TRAINING AND

01:30:53.881 --> 01:30:56.450
CULTURAL COMPETENCY. THANK YOU

01:30:56.517 --> 01:30:57.985
AND I WOULD JUST TRY TO GET TO

01:30:58.052 --> 01:31:00.021
SEE SOME OF WHAT WE HEARD THAT

01:31:00.087 --> 01:31:01.622
MAY ALARM PEOPLE IS THAT PEOPLE

01:31:01.689 --> 01:31:02.790
JUST. CALLING ON THE PHONE AND

01:31:02.857 --> 01:31:04.625
GET PRESCRIPTIONS. SO DID SO

01:31:04.692 --> 01:31:05.760
FROM MY PERSPECTIVE HERE'S WHAT

01:31:05.827 --> 01:31:07.295
I KNOW AS A LICENSED PERSON

01:31:07.361 --> 01:31:08.429
WHO'S TRAINED OTHER LICENSE

01:31:08.496 --> 01:31:10.498
PEOPLE. IN ORDER TO GET. THE

01:31:10.565 --> 01:31:12.099
DIAGNOSIS OF GENDER DYSPHORIA

01:31:12.166 --> 01:31:13.701
YOU HAVE TO HAVE MULTIPLE

01:31:13.768 --> 01:31:15.837
MULTIPLE MEETINGS FOR THE MOST

01:31:15.903 --> 01:31:16.871
PART- BEFORE THE DIAGNOSIS IS

01:31:16.938 --> 01:31:19.607
GIVEN AND THEN. IN ORDER FOR THE

01:31:19.674 --> 01:31:22.276
TRANSITION TO OCCUR. THAT THAT

01:31:22.343 --> 01:31:26.013
THAT'S WHAT IT'S BASED ON- SO-

01:31:26.080 --> 01:31:28.115
IN AND I AGREE WE HEARD WE HEARD

01:31:28.182 --> 01:31:29.784
. WE HEARD A LOT OF WHAT YOU'RE

01:31:29.851 --> 01:31:31.118
TALKING ABOUT ABOUT PEOPLE

01:31:31.185 --> 01:31:32.320
DENYING PEOPLE'S EXISTENCE

01:31:32.386 --> 01:31:33.988
SAYING IT'S NOT REAL THING IT'S

01:31:34.055 --> 01:31:37.191
FAKE- AND I AND I GET THERE

01:31:37.258 --> 01:31:39.160
COULD BE DIFFERENCES OF OPINION

01:31:39.227 --> 01:31:40.962
BUT I THINK OUR JOB AS

01:31:41.028 --> 01:31:43.064
LEGISLATORS IS TO MAKE SURE OUR

01:31:43.130 --> 01:31:45.833
SYSTEMS ARE JUST- AND THAT'S

01:31:45.900 --> 01:31:48.169
THAT'S WHAT WE ARE WE'RE TRYING

01:31:48.236 --> 01:31:51.339
TO DO- SO. THIS BILL HAS NOTHING

01:31:51.405 --> 01:31:52.673
TO DO WITH MANDATING ANYTHING

01:31:52.740 --> 01:31:53.608
BUT THAT PEOPLE SHOULD KNOW

01:31:53.674 --> 01:31:56.978
ABOUT- WHO THEY SEE ANNA AND I

01:31:57.044 --> 01:31:58.246
FEEL LIKE A LOT OF THE

01:31:58.312 --> 01:32:00.114
OPPOSITION TESTIMONY. ACTUALLY

01:32:00.181 --> 01:32:01.749
SUPPORT YOUR BILL. THAT WE

01:32:01.816 --> 01:32:03.251
SHOULD HAVE MORE CONVERSATION

01:32:03.317 --> 01:32:04.752
THAT IT SHOULDN'T BE THAT

MORE TRAINING NOT LESS TRAINING

01:33:58.933 --> 01:34:00.735
IS THAT WE DON'T ACTUALLY

01:34:00.801 --> 01:34:03.571
DICTATE. WHO DOES THE TRAINING

01:34:03.637 --> 01:34:05.272
BECAUSE THAT IS THE MEDICAL

01:34:05.339 --> 01:34:07.708
COMMUNITY THAT DECIDES WHO IS

01:34:07.775 --> 01:34:09.677
THE RIGHT PERSON SO I'M NOT SURE

01:34:09.744 --> 01:34:11.545
THAT WE WOULD BE IN A POSITION

01:34:11.612 --> 01:34:13.180

PROFESSIONAL CAREER UP THERE ARE

01:34:23.624 --> 01:34:25.993
SO MANY REASONS TO HAVE

01:34:26.060 --> 01:34:27.928
ADDITIONAL TRAINING REGARDLESS

01:34:27.995 --> 01:34:29.797
OF WHAT OUR CAREER IS- AND I

01:34:29.864 --> 01:34:31.799
THINK THAT. IT IT YOU KNOW

INCLUDING A BROADER

01:34:33.701 --> 01:34:36.504
UNDERSTANDING I THINK IS THE

01:34:36.570 --> 01:34:39.807
RIGHT MEDICAL DIRECTION TO GO-

01:34:39.874 --> 01:34:42.676

EGGMAN ALLUDED TO THIS WE HAVE

01:35:06.200 --> 01:35:08.469

01:35:09.637 --> 01:35:11.672
REASON WE DO THIS IS BECAUSE

THERE IS ALWAYS MORE WE CAN

01:35:13.741 --> 01:35:16.143

ADVANCES. BUT THERE'S ALSO BEEN

01:41:27.214 --> 01:41:31.251
B. THE UGLY SIDE. AND IT'S SO

01:41:31.318 --> 01:41:32.686
IMPORTANT FOR COMMUNITIES HAVE

01:41:32.753 --> 01:41:34.188
CONFIDENCE IN THE HEALTH CARE

01:41:34.254 --> 01:41:37.090
SYSTEM. TO BELIEVE THAT THEY'RE

01:41:37.157 --> 01:41:38.592
GOING TO GET THE HIGHEST LEVEL

01:41:38.659 --> 01:41:40.227
OF CARE THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE

01:41:40.294 --> 01:41:42.196

EXAMPLE THAT. BLACK COMMUNITIES

01:41:46.633 --> 01:41:49.369
OFTEN HAVE LACK OF CONFIDENCE IN

01:41:49.436 --> 01:41:51.271
OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. WHICH

01:41:51.338 --> 01:41:53.640
THERE'S A REASON FOR THAT YOU

01:41:53.707 --> 01:41:54.408
LOOK AT TO SKI. OR OTHER

01:41:54.475 --> 01:41:56.643
SITUATIONS WHERE THE HEALTHCARE

01:41:56.710 --> 01:41:59.379
SYSTEM IS BADLY ABUSED- BLACK

01:41:59.446 --> 01:42:01.949
PEOPLE. AND SO WE SAW WHAT

01:42:02.015 --> 01:42:04.017
HAPPENED DURING COLLUDED. WHEN

01:42:04.084 --> 01:42:05.586
THERE WAS A LACK OF CONFIDENCE

01:42:05.652 --> 01:42:08.088
HESITANCY TO GET CARE AND THE

01:42:08.155 --> 01:42:11.091
DISPARATE IMPACTS AND HARMS.

01:42:11.158 --> 01:42:13.994
THAT WAS THE RESULT IT. WON'T

01:42:14.061 --> 01:42:15.596
LOOK AT. HELP HELP HEALTHCARE IS

01:42:15.662 --> 01:42:17.564
TREATED WOMEN OVER TIME WHETHER

01:42:17.631 --> 01:42:19.500
IT WAS INSTITUTIONALIZING. YOU

01:42:19.566 --> 01:42:21.101
KNOW WOMEN FOR BEING QUOTE

01:42:21.168 --> 01:42:24.571
UNQUOTE HYSTERICAL. THAT WAS.

01:42:24.638 --> 01:42:25.939
SEVEN FOR A LONG TIME UNTIL NOT

01:42:26.006 --> 01:42:28.108
THAT LONG AGO AND OTHER WAYS IN

01:42:28.175 --> 01:42:29.843
WHICH WOMEN HAVE BEEN

01:42:29.910 --> 01:42:31.211
MARGINALIZED IN THE HEALTH CARE

01:42:31.278 --> 01:42:33.981
SYSTEM. WE LOOK AT THE ISSUE OF

01:42:34.047 --> 01:42:36.283
LGBTQ COMMUNITY WERE USED TO BE

01:42:36.350 --> 01:42:39.319
YOU WERE YOUR LGBTQ. YOU COULD

01:42:39.386 --> 01:42:44.791
BE. THE WATER SHOCK THERAPY.

01:42:44.858 --> 01:42:46.527
INSTITUTIONALIZE SIMPLY FOR

01:42:46.593 --> 01:42:49.329
BEING WHO YOU ARE THAT WAS TO

01:42:49.396 --> 01:42:52.399
THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. AND THAT

01:42:52.466 --> 01:42:54.568
AND IT HAS CONSEQUENCES FOR THE

01:42:54.635 --> 01:42:55.969
HEALTH CARE SYSTEM DOESN'T SEE

01:42:56.036 --> 01:42:58.005
PEOPLE WHO THEY ARE AND TREAT

01:42:58.071 --> 01:42:59.940
THEM WITH BASIC RESPECT AND

01:43:00.007 --> 01:43:02.242
DIGNITY THAT RECOGNIZES THEM AS

01:43:02.309 --> 01:43:04.811
FULL HUMAN BEINGS AND THAT IS

01:43:04.878 --> 01:43:07.147

AND THEY'RE NOT GOING TO GO GET

01:43:29.069 --> 01:43:30.871
HEALTH CARE IF THEY BELIEVE THAT

01:43:30.938 --> 01:43:32.472
THEY'RE GOING TO BE TREATED

01:43:32.539 --> 01:43:35.576

ADMINISTERED AMENDMENT TO COMPLY

WITH THE LAWS IS CRITICALLY

02:10:59.418 --> 02:11:00.852
IMPORTANT TO US AND IT DOES

02:11:00.919 --> 02:11:02.387
ELIMINATE. SOME OF OUR

02:11:02.454 --> 02:11:03.388
OPPOSITION UNFORTUNATELY NOT ALL

02:11:03.455 --> 02:11:05.891
OF IT- AND THAT'S FOR SEVERAL

02:11:05.958 --> 02:11:09.194
REASONS FIRST WE DO HAVE A FILL

02:11:09.261 --> 02:11:10.829
. DIFFERENCE ON FORSTER COURSE

02:11:10.896 --> 02:11:11.830
MEDICATION AN OUTPATIENT

02:11:11.897 --> 02:11:14.032
SETTINGS. ALL RECENT INDIVIDUALS

02:11:14.099 --> 02:11:15.167
IN AN OUTPATIENT SETTING THIS

02:11:15.234 --> 02:11:17.302
BECAUSE THEY HAVE. CAPACITY TO

02:11:17.369 --> 02:11:18.136
MAKE MEDICAL DECISIONS ABOUT

02:11:18.203 --> 02:11:20.038
THEIR BODIES. ESPECIALLY WHEN IT

02:11:20.105 --> 02:11:20.939
COMES TO PSYCHOTROPIC

02:11:21.006 --> 02:11:22.841
MEDICATIONS OR MEDICATIONS WITH

02:11:22.908 --> 02:11:25.177
BLACK BOX LABELS. THAT HAVE SIDE

02:11:25.244 --> 02:11:26.912
EFFECTS. OTHER UNINTENDED

02:11:26.979 --> 02:11:28.847
CONSEQUENCES AND SOMETIMES

02:11:28.914 --> 02:11:30.249
INDIVIDUALS DON'T TAKE

02:11:30.315 --> 02:11:31.350
MEDICATION SIMPLY BECAUSE OF

02:11:31.416 --> 02:11:32.751
MISCOMMUNICATION WITH THEIR

02:11:32.818 --> 02:11:34.152
PSYCHIATRIST THE PRESCRIBING

02:11:34.219 --> 02:11:35.854
PHYSICIAN. OR VARIOUS OTHER

02:11:35.921 --> 02:11:38.457
REASONS- ANOTHER CONCERN WE HAVE

02:11:38.523 --> 02:11:40.158
WITH THIS BILL IS THE LACK OF A

02:11:40.225 --> 02:11:41.593
CLEAR FORTUNATE MECHANISM. WHEN

02:11:41.660 --> 02:11:42.928
THE STATE AUDITOR ISSUED ITS

02:11:42.995 --> 02:11:44.129
REPORT AND MADE THIS

02:11:44.196 --> 02:11:45.664
RECOMMENDATION THE AUDITORS

02:11:45.731 --> 02:11:46.999
SUGGESTED ALSO HAVE A CLEAR

02:11:47.065 --> 02:11:48.166
PORCELAIN MECHANISM FOR

02:11:48.233 --> 02:11:50.269
INDIVIDUALS TAKING OR- BE

02:11:50.335 --> 02:11:52.004
REQUIRED TO TAKE THESE

02:11:52.070 --> 02:11:52.938
MEDICATIONS. SPECIFICALLY WHAT

02:11:53.005 --> 02:11:54.506
WOULD HAPPEN TO AN INDIVIDUAL

02:11:54.573 --> 02:11:55.741
WHO IS REQUIRED TO SELF

02:11:55.807 --> 02:11:57.476
EMISSIONS MANY MEDICATION AND

02:11:57.542 --> 02:11:59.978
CHOSE NOT TO DO SO. WITH A FACE

02:12:00.045 --> 02:12:01.847
ADDITIONAL COURT HEARINGS WHAT

02:12:01.913 --> 02:12:03.181
INDIVIDUAL SHOW UP TO THEIR

02:12:03.248 --> 02:12:04.750
HOUSE AND ASK THEM IF THEY'RE

02:12:04.816 --> 02:12:08.587
TAKING MEDICATION. WHAT EXACTLY

02:12:08.654 --> 02:12:10.188
WOULD THAT LOOK LIKE. THE BILL

02:12:10.255 --> 02:12:11.690
AS IT'S TODAY. WOULD SEEM TO

02:12:11.757 --> 02:12:13.058
SUGGEST THAT SINCE IT'S PART OF

02:12:13.125 --> 02:12:14.293
THE TREATMENT PLAN AN INDIVIDUAL

02:12:14.359 --> 02:12:16.828
WOULD BE. OUT OF THE ACCORD WITH

02:12:16.895 --> 02:12:18.330
THEIR TREATMENT AND THEN WOULD

02:12:18.397 --> 02:12:19.698
BE SUBJECT POTENTIALLY TO A

02:12:19.765 --> 02:12:21.433
FIFTY ONE FIFTIES OR VARIOUS

02:12:21.500 --> 02:12:23.602
OTHER PROVISIONS WHERE. THEY

02:12:23.669 --> 02:12:25.337
COULD BE COMBINED WITH THEIR

02:12:25.404 --> 02:12:26.605
TREATMENT PLAN THEY COULD BE

02:12:26.672 --> 02:12:27.673
GOING TO OTHER MEETINGS THAT

02:12:27.739 --> 02:12:29.107

MEDICATION MAC MIGHT JUST BE THE

02:12:32.177 --> 02:12:33.445
ONLY ISSUE. AND SO I BRING THOSE

02:12:33.512 --> 02:12:35.247
CONCERNS TO THE COMMITTEE TODAY

02:55:45.668 --> 02:55:47.136
SEEKING AN ABORTION RIGHT THAT'S

02:55:47.203 --> 02:55:48.938
THE NUTS AND BOLTS OF IT. THERE

02:55:49.005 --> 02:55:50.673
ARE TWO SEPARATE PIECES AND ONE

02:55:50.740 --> 02:55:52.942
IS A WEBSITE AND ONE IN RIGHT ON

02:55:53.009 --> 02:55:55.378
THE FUNDING OKAY FOR THE

02:55:55.444 --> 02:55:58.781
FUNDING- PURSUANT TO THE

02:55:58.848 --> 02:56:00.416
LEGISLATURE MAKING THE

02:56:00.483 --> 02:56:04.086
PREPARATION FOR THE FUNDS- THESE

02:56:04.153 --> 02:56:08.324
FUNDS WOULD COULD BE ACCESSED BY

02:56:08.391 --> 02:56:09.959
. ANY WOMAN SEEKING AN ABORTION

02:56:10.026 --> 02:56:11.260
WHETHER SHE'S A CALIFORNIA

02:56:11.327 --> 02:56:13.229
RESIDENT OR NOT IS THAT CORRECT

02:56:13.296 --> 02:56:16.499
THE STATE FUNDS- WELL THAT IT

02:56:16.565 --> 02:56:17.867
THERE IS IT IS WE ANTICIPATE A

02:56:17.934 --> 02:56:19.702
FUND THE FUND WILL WOULD INCLUDE

02:56:19.769 --> 02:56:21.237
STATE RESOURCES AND THEN THEY

02:56:21.304 --> 02:56:23.272
WOULD INCLUDE- PHILANTHROPIC

02:56:23.339 --> 02:56:25.007
RESOURCES INCLUDING DONATIONS

02:56:25.074 --> 02:56:27.743
FROM INDIVIDUALS- RIGHT NOW IT

02:56:27.810 --> 02:56:30.746
APPEARS AS IT AS IF WE NEED TO

02:56:30.813 --> 02:56:32.148
SEGREGATE THOSE FUNDS BECAUSE

02:56:32.214 --> 02:56:32.982
THEY HAVE DIFFERENT

02:56:33.049 --> 02:56:35.584
CONSEQUENCES- AND IT'S OUR

02:56:35.651 --> 02:56:37.053
ANTICIPATION THE STATE FUNDS

02:56:37.119 --> 02:56:38.487
WOULD BE USED FOR STATE

02:56:38.554 --> 02:56:40.356
RESIDENTS IN THE PHILANTHROPIC-

02:56:40.423 --> 02:56:42.658
FUND WOULD BE USED FOR OUT OF

02:56:42.725 --> 02:56:47.630
STATE- FOR. ANYBODY WHO- IS

02:56:47.697 --> 02:56:50.066
ASKING THE FOR- SERVICES IN THE

02:56:50.132 --> 02:56:52.134
STATE OF CALIFORNIA OKAY THAT IS

02:56:52.201 --> 02:56:53.469
NOT OUTLINED IN THE BILL THOUGH

02:56:53.536 --> 02:56:56.138
THAT IS CORRECT ARE YOU PLANNING

02:56:56.205 --> 02:56:57.239
ON AMENDING IT YES. WE'RE

02:56:57.306 --> 02:56:58.741
WORKING ON ON EXACTLY HOW WE

02:56:58.808 --> 02:57:00.242
HAVE TO SET UP THE FUNDS IN

02:57:00.309 --> 02:57:02.311
ORDER TO COMPLY WITH. STATE LAW

02:57:02.378 --> 02:57:05.014
OKAY SO AT THIS POINT YOU'RE NOT

02:57:05.081 --> 02:57:06.182
CLEAR AS TO HOW. HE WOULD DO

02:57:06.248 --> 02:57:09.652
THAT. NO THIS TO AT THIS TIME

02:57:09.719 --> 02:57:11.287
IT'S CLEAR HOW WE WOULD DO THAT

02:57:11.354 --> 02:57:13.055
IT'S A QUESTION OF EXACTLY WHERE

02:57:13.122 --> 02:57:15.191
THE FUNDS WOULD BE AND HOW THEY

02:57:15.257 --> 02:57:20.529
WOULD BE ALLOCATED- ACTUALLY OF

02:57:20.596 --> 02:57:22.398
THIS WEEK OKAY THAT AND UNLESS

02:57:22.465 --> 02:57:25.368
UNLESS SOMEONE'S ASKING ASKING

02:57:25.434 --> 02:57:28.170
ME FOR THAT SORRY. S. S. S. IS

02:57:28.237 --> 02:57:29.672
VERY COMMON IN MANY BILLS WHEN

02:57:29.739 --> 02:57:31.374
YOU'RE STILL TRYING TO WORK OUT

02:57:31.440 --> 02:57:33.209
THE DETAILS OF IMPLEMENTATION IN

02:57:33.275 --> 02:57:38.047
BECAUSE OF OBVIOUSLY THIS WOULD

02:57:38.114 --> 02:57:41.684
BEEN MEETING WITH. YES FUNDS

02:57:41.751 --> 02:57:44.687
STATE AGENCIES TO. WE WANTED TO

02:57:44.754 --> 02:57:46.155
MAKE SURE THAT THE STRUCTURE WAS

02:57:46.222 --> 02:57:49.058
EXACTLY RIGHT AND WE'VE NOT

02:57:49.125 --> 02:57:51.327
LANDED ON THAT BUT WE HAD FOR

02:57:51.394 --> 02:57:52.428
EXAMPLE MEETING TODAY ON THE

02:57:52.495 --> 02:57:53.996
QUESTION AND SO WE WILL BE

02:57:54.063 --> 02:57:56.132
AMENDING IT SO THAT IT OUTLINES

02:57:56.198 --> 02:57:59.635
EXACTLY WHAT THE THAT DIFFERENCE

02:57:59.702 --> 02:58:02.838
IN ANY OTHER DIFFERENCES WE NEED

02:58:02.905 --> 02:58:04.040
FOR THE FUND TO BE ESTABLISHED

02:58:04.106 --> 02:58:06.675
APPROPRIATELY SO CAN I ASK-

02:58:06.742 --> 02:58:08.477
WHAT'S THE RUSH I MEAN IT THIS

02:58:08.544 --> 02:58:10.246
SEEMS COMPLICATED ON HOW YOU

02:58:10.312 --> 02:58:11.714
MIGHT COMPLICATED BECAUSE WE

02:58:11.781 --> 02:58:13.783
ALREADY HAVE FOR EXAMPLE- IF WE

02:58:13.849 --> 02:58:15.818
TAKES NOT A BELL STYLE NO IT'S

02:58:15.885 --> 02:58:17.620
NOT IN THE BILL YET BECAUSE- THE

02:58:17.686 --> 02:58:19.188
TODAY THIS THE FIRST HEARING

02:58:19.255 --> 02:58:21.223
ENDED. THAT'S WERE PART OF THE

02:58:21.290 --> 02:58:22.992
LEGISLATIVE PROCESSYOUR WE'RE

02:58:23.059 --> 02:58:24.326
GOING THROUGH THE PROCESS AND WE

02:58:24.393 --> 02:58:26.362
STILL HAVE OTHER COMMITTEES THAT

02:58:26.429 --> 02:58:27.997
WILL HAVE TO BE VITAL INTEREST I

02:58:28.064 --> 02:58:29.598
IF I GET THAT IN THE LEGISLATIVE

02:58:29.665 --> 02:58:31.567
PROCESS OFTENTIMES BILLS ARE

02:58:31.634 --> 02:58:32.568
AMENDED ALONG THE WAY

02:58:32.635 --> 02:58:34.336
DISSATISFIED THE CONCERNS OF THE

02:58:34.403 --> 02:58:36.238
COMMITTEE- MORE TO MAKE SURE

02:58:36.305 --> 02:58:37.807
THAT YOU HAVE IMPLEMENTATION

02:58:37.873 --> 02:58:42.445
MECHANISMS BUT BUT GENERALLY THE

02:58:42.511 --> 02:58:44.513
BILL IS- YOU KNOW GOT MORE. IS

02:58:44.580 --> 02:58:47.083
MORE COOKED THAN THIS BUT-

02:58:47.149 --> 02:58:48.784
THAT'S NEITHER HERE NOR THERE-

02:58:48.851 --> 02:58:50.686
SO YOU TURN OF MY BILLS THAT

02:58:50.753 --> 02:58:51.954
STILL NEED IMPLEMENTATION

02:58:52.021 --> 02:58:54.690
DETAILS. SO THE FUNDS COULD BE

02:58:54.757 --> 02:58:57.993
USED FOR- THOSE WHO COME TO

02:58:58.060 --> 02:59:00.196
CALIFORNIA FROM OUT OF STATE

02:59:00.262 --> 02:59:12.041
FOR- AN ABORTION. AND. I GUESS.

02:59:12.108 --> 02:59:14.009
RIGHT I KNOW YOU MADE MENTION

02:59:14.076 --> 02:59:17.780
DURING YOUR COMMENTS ABOUT- IT

02:59:17.847 --> 02:59:20.282
THERE SEEMS TO BE SOME SORT OF

02:59:20.349 --> 02:59:22.251
NATIONWIDE PRESS ON THIS BUT AT

02:59:22.318 --> 02:59:25.020
THIS POINT IN TIME THE TEXAS

02:59:25.087 --> 02:59:28.491
ABORTION BILL IS THE ONLY ONE

02:59:28.557 --> 02:59:30.793
THAT HAS WITH HELD- YOU KNOW

02:59:30.860 --> 02:59:34.263
LEGALLY I MEAN THAT'S IT SO I AM

02:59:34.330 --> 02:59:36.565
. I'M NOT SURE I UNDERSTAND WHAT

02:59:36.632 --> 02:59:38.033
YOU'RE SAYING THAT THE SUPREME

02:59:38.100 --> 02:59:39.435
COURT MAY RULE ON THIS BUT THEY

02:59:39.502 --> 02:59:41.137
HAVEN'T I DON'T KNOW THAT WE

02:59:41.203 --> 02:59:43.906
HAVE A CRYSTAL BALL AND COULD

02:59:43.973 --> 02:59:44.840
POSSIBLY KNOW WHAT THEY'RE GOING

02:59:44.907 --> 02:59:47.209
TO DO- BUT- A- I GUESS

02:59:47.276 --> 02:59:50.246
IRRESPECTIVE OF THAT- RIGHT YOU

02:59:50.312 --> 02:59:55.384
KNOW I. I GUESS PLANNED

02:59:55.451 --> 02:59:56.719
PARENTHOOD IS PROBABLY VERY

02:59:56.785 --> 02:59:57.887
HAPPY THAT YOU'RE BRINGING THIS

02:59:57.953 --> 02:59:59.088
BILL FORWARD BECAUSE THEY ARE

02:59:59.155 --> 03:00:00.890
THE ONES WHO STAND TO BENEFIT

03:00:00.956 --> 03:00:02.791
THE MOST- THANKS TO THE

03:00:02.858 --> 03:00:04.593
TAXPAYERS IN ANY PHILANTHROPIC

03:00:04.660 --> 03:00:07.796
EFFORTS- BUT I CANNOT SUPPORT A

03:00:07.863 --> 03:00:11.767
BILL THAT. SEEKS TO SNUFF OUT

03:00:11.834 --> 03:00:14.069
THE LIFE OF A HUMAN BEING THAT'S

03:00:14.136 --> 03:00:16.505
A PHILOSOPHICAL- DIFFERENCE

03:00:16.572 --> 03:00:18.541
OBVIOUSLY NUMBER I ALSO DON'T

03:00:18.607 --> 03:00:19.608
THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE THAT WE

03:00:19.675 --> 03:00:21.677
WOULD THAT THE TAXPAYERS OF

03:00:21.744 --> 03:00:24.146
CALIFORNIA WOULD WOULD PAY FOR

03:00:24.213 --> 03:00:26.015
THAT I JUST I JUST DON'T BELIEVE

03:00:26.081 --> 03:00:27.316
THAT'S THE PURPOSE OF THOSE

03:00:27.383 --> 03:00:29.351
THROUGH TWO THINGS COMBINED I'M

03:00:29.418 --> 03:00:30.719
SURE THIS COMES AS A SURPRISE TO

03:00:30.786 --> 03:00:32.421
YOU ON THAT I CAN'T SUPPORT THE

03:00:32.488 --> 03:00:34.523
BILL BUT I JUST. I WILL END MY

03:00:34.590 --> 03:00:39.828
COMMENTS BY SAYING THAT- I THINK

03:00:39.895 --> 03:00:42.231
. THIS PERHAPS THE GENESIS WAS

03:00:42.298 --> 03:00:43.532
THE GOVERNOR'S STATEMENT THAT HE

03:00:43.599 --> 03:00:45.668
WANTED CALIFORNIA TO BECOME THE

03:00:45.734 --> 03:00:47.536
ABORTION SANCTUARY WHICH I CAN

03:00:47.603 --> 03:00:49.471
THINK OF MANY MANY THINGS THAT

03:00:49.538 --> 03:00:50.306
WE SHOULD BE KNOWN FOR THAT IS

03:00:50.372 --> 03:00:53.309
NOT ONE OF THEM- BUT I YOU KNOW

03:00:53.375 --> 03:00:54.944
MY GUESS IS IT'S COMING FROM

03:00:55.010 --> 03:00:56.445
THAT AND THIS IS A WAY TO HELP

03:00:56.512 --> 03:00:59.548
IMPLEMENT HIS VISION- BUT IT IS

03:00:59.615 --> 03:01:02.451
NOT APPROPRIATE TO ASK- OTHER

03:01:02.518 --> 03:01:04.987
PEOPLE TO PAY FOR- SOMEONE

03:01:05.054 --> 03:01:09.058
ELSE'S ABORTIONS SO- I WILL NOT

03:01:09.124 --> 03:01:11.160
BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY.

03:01:11.227 --> 03:01:13.529
OKAY THANK YOU SIR MELENDEZ-

03:01:13.596 --> 03:01:15.998
CENTER WINNER. THANK YOU MISTER

03:01:16.065 --> 03:01:17.933
CHAIRMAN- I THINK THE TAXPAYERS

03:01:18.000 --> 03:01:21.036
SHOULD ABSOLUTELY BE SUPPORTING-

03:01:21.103 --> 03:01:23.472
PEOPLE'S ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE

03:01:23.539 --> 03:01:24.273
INCLUDING REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH

03:01:24.340 --> 03:01:27.910
CARE INCLUDING ABORTION- AND I

03:01:27.977 --> 03:01:30.512
AND I WAS OTHER STATES- MOVED

03:01:30.579 --> 03:01:33.249
TO- EFFECTIVELY BAN ABORTION I

03:01:33.315 --> 03:01:34.483
THINK OKLAHOMA IS THE LATEST

03:01:34.550 --> 03:01:38.654
ONE- AS WE SEE THE TRAIN WRECK

03:01:38.721 --> 03:01:40.522
THAT. IS THE UNITED STATES

03:01:40.589 --> 03:01:43.325
SUPREME COURT- I THINK I THINK

03:01:43.392 --> 03:01:46.262
IT'S CRITICAL AND LIFESAVING FOR

03:01:46.328 --> 03:01:48.163
CALIFORNIA TO PROVIDE A PLACE

03:01:48.230 --> 03:01:50.432
WHERE PEOPLE CAN COME AND SEE

03:01:50.499 --> 03:01:52.468
REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE IF

03:01:52.534 --> 03:01:54.370
THEY'RE BANNED AND CRIMINALIZED-

03:01:54.436 --> 03:01:56.705
DOING SO IN THEIR OWN- IN THEIR

03:01:56.772 --> 03:01:58.307
OWN STATE I'M PEOPLE DO ANY

03:01:58.374 --> 03:01:59.908
FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE ARE PEOPLE

03:01:59.975 --> 03:02:01.410
WHO HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF BEING

03:02:01.477 --> 03:02:03.579
ABLE TO FLY ACROSS THE COUNTRY

03:02:03.646 --> 03:02:05.281
AND GET A HOTEL ROOM AND PAY FOR

03:02:05.347 --> 03:02:07.016
CARE. NOT EVERYONE CAN DO THAT

03:02:07.082 --> 03:02:08.851
ABOUT THEIR PARTS OF CALIFORNIA

03:02:08.917 --> 03:02:09.585
WHERE PEOPLE STRUGGLE TO HAVE

03:02:09.652 --> 03:02:12.621
ACCESS SO I THINK THIS IS

03:02:12.688 --> 03:02:14.323
INCREDIBLY. IMPORTANT I THINK

03:02:14.390 --> 03:02:16.358
IT'S TERRIFYING WHAT'S HAPPENING

03:02:16.425 --> 03:02:18.761
AROUND THE COUNTRY IS ABSOLUTELY

03:02:18.827 --> 03:02:21.030
TERRIFYING THAT THEIR WOMEN IN

03:02:21.096 --> 03:02:22.264
THIS COUNTRY AND THEY ARE

03:02:22.331 --> 03:02:24.199
DISPROPORTIONATELY LOW INCOME

03:02:24.266 --> 03:02:26.402
PEOPLE ARE LOW INCOME WOMEN

03:02:26.468 --> 03:02:28.871
PEOPLE WHO AND PEOPLE OF COLOR.

03:02:28.937 --> 03:02:32.041
WHO ARE AND WHO ARE GOING TO BE.

03:02:32.107 --> 03:02:33.976
EFFECTIVELY FORCED BY THE STATE

03:02:34.043 --> 03:02:36.211
THEY LIVE IN- TO CARRY A

03:02:36.278 --> 03:02:38.314
PREGNANCY TO TERM THAT FOR

03:02:38.380 --> 03:02:41.750
WHATEVER REASON THERE AND DO NOT

03:02:41.817 --> 03:02:45.321
WANT TO CARRY TO TERM OR NOT. SO

03:02:45.387 --> 03:02:47.890
I'M IT IS LITERALLY. THEM

03:02:47.956 --> 03:02:49.491
COMMANDEER THEIR BODY AND

03:02:49.558 --> 03:02:52.461
TELLING THEM YOU MUST CARRY TO

03:02:52.528 --> 03:02:56.665
TERM. AND THAT IS NOT TO ME

03:02:56.732 --> 03:03:00.269
THAT'S NOT. AMERICAN THAT'S NOT

03:03:00.336 --> 03:03:02.838
WHAT THIS COUNTRY IS ABOUT- THIS

03:03:02.905 --> 03:03:06.608
IS COUNTRY IS ABOUT. FREEDOM AND

03:03:06.675 --> 03:03:09.078
IT IS ABOUT- PEOPLE MAKING THOSE

03:03:09.144 --> 03:03:12.848
DECISIONS FOR THEMSELVES- AND

03:03:12.915 --> 03:03:15.084
SO- I STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS

03:03:15.150 --> 03:03:19.054
BILL- I NOTICED THAT THE- CO

03:03:19.121 --> 03:03:22.825
AUTHOR LISTS ARE- ALL ONE GENDER

03:03:22.891 --> 03:03:25.060

03:03:34.970 --> 03:03:36.572
OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS

TWENTY MEMBERS FACING NONE-

03:03:40.342 --> 03:03:42.211
BUCKLEY IS EIGHT I THINK CENTER

03:03:42.277 --> 03:03:43.679
LEADER PROBABLY CAPTURED A LOT

03:03:43.746 --> 03:03:45.881

03:24:39.433 --> 03:24:41.402
THAT IF NECESSARY ONE CAN BE

03:24:41.469 --> 03:24:43.070
AVAILABLE. THROUGH THE TELLER

03:24:43.137 --> 03:24:44.205
MOTORS ARE CORRECT THAT IS

03:24:44.271 --> 03:24:45.606
CORRECT OKAY SO BECAUSE I'M

03:24:45.673 --> 03:24:47.375
THINKING LIKE IT'S IN THE ISSUES

03:24:47.441 --> 03:24:48.709
OF BEING OUT IN REMOTE AREAS

03:24:48.776 --> 03:24:50.344
PERHAPS THAT CLINIC WOULD OPT TO

03:24:50.411 --> 03:24:51.912
BE ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF

INCREASE PEOPLE'S ACCESS TO CARE

03:24:58.486 --> 03:24:59.353
JUST BECAUSE THEY'RE ABLE TO USE

03:24:59.420 --> 03:25:03.357
TELEHEALTH- IN MORE WAYS- AND

03:25:03.424 --> 03:25:05.192

EVIDENCE OF TO BE REQUIRING A

03:25:18.472 --> 03:25:20.541
HIGHER LEVEL DEGREE BUT THAT

03:25:20.608 --> 03:25:22.276
PERSON NOT BEING ON SITE BUT

03:25:22.343 --> 03:25:24.045
THAT WORK IS GOING ON. NOBODY

03:25:24.111 --> 03:25:26.147

PROFESSION. I THINK THIS IS

03:25:49.270 --> 03:25:50.671
ANOTHER STEP WE CAN TAKE FORWARD

03:25:50.738 --> 03:25:52.440

HAVING ARE IN THIS- ED TO BLOOD

03:27:12.520 --> 03:27:14.655
DONATION SITES. BUT FOR NOW I

03:27:14.722 --> 03:27:16.590

OTHER FOR BRING IT FORWARD. ANY

I WAS IN THE LEGISLATURE DID

03:27:29.703 --> 03:27:31.806
SERVE ON A BOARD OF A BLOOD

03:27:31.872 --> 03:27:34.542
BANK- AND- POSITION AND OF

03:27:34.608 --> 03:27:36.076
COURSE THOSE FAMILIAR WITH THE-

03:27:36.143 --> 03:27:38.212

OF COURSE THOSE CONCERNS NEED TO

03:27:49.790 --> 03:27:53.394
BE BACKED UP BY DATA. AND SO I

03:27:53.460 --> 03:27:55.095
CERTAINLY AGREE THAT WE DON'T

03:27:55.162 --> 03:27:56.964
HAVE TO BE LIKE EVERY OTHER

03:27:57.031 --> 03:27:59.233
STATE- THAT- WERE. WE CAN BE

03:27:59.300 --> 03:28:02.736
UNIQUE- BUT THAT EXPERIENCE AND

03:28:02.803 --> 03:28:03.370
ALL THOSE OTHER STATES CAN HELP

03:28:03.437 --> 03:28:05.573
INFORM. WHETHER WHAT WE'RE DOING

03:28:05.639 --> 03:28:08.442
IS IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE OR NOT.

03:28:08.509 --> 03:28:10.444
AND I THINK AT LEAST AND I

03:28:10.511 --> 03:28:11.946
APPRECIATE THAT RUBIO'S COMMENTS

03:28:12.012 --> 03:28:13.447
LIKE I I'VE BEEN CHALLENGE IN

03:28:13.514 --> 03:28:17.484
FINDING THE DATA. SHOWS THAT

03:28:17.551 --> 03:28:18.519
DOING THIS IS. RAISES A

03:28:18.586 --> 03:28:20.554
SIGNIFICANT SAFETY CONCERN OR

03:28:20.621 --> 03:28:21.288
EVEN A MINOR SAY CONCERN IN

03:28:21.355 --> 03:28:22.890
ADDITION THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING

03:28:22.957 --> 03:28:24.358
THIS ACTUALLY UNDER COVERT

03:28:24.425 --> 03:28:24.959
UNFORTUNATELY BECAUSE OF THE

03:28:25.025 --> 03:28:27.394
PANDEMIC OF BUT- AND WE HAVE NOT

03:28:27.461 --> 03:28:28.495
SEEN IT NOT ONLY OF COURSE AND

03:28:28.562 --> 03:28:30.798
DRESS THE COUNTRY BUT ALSO

03:28:30.865 --> 03:28:31.565
STEVEN HERE IN OUR STATE. I DO

03:28:31.632 --> 03:28:34.668

THAT- NO IT'S NOT QUITE THE SAME

03:28:38.339 --> 03:28:39.773
CIRCUMSTANCE FOR FEWER PATIENTS

03:28:39.840 --> 03:28:41.575
SAID CETERA SO MAYBE IT'S LESS

03:28:41.642 --> 03:28:43.177
LIKELY WILL PICK SOMETHING UP

03:28:43.244 --> 03:28:44.578
BUT WE STILL HAVEN'T SEEN THE

03:28:44.645 --> 03:28:46.113
SAFETY SIGNAL COMING UP SANDERS

03:28:46.180 --> 03:28:48.515
A- PERSON OF CONSENT TO CONCERN.

03:28:48.582 --> 03:28:50.017
I THINK THAT'S I THINK THAT'S

03:28:50.084 --> 03:28:52.152
THE CHALLENGE FOR- THE

03:28:52.219 --> 03:28:54.822
OPPOSITION IS THAT IF YOU KNOW

03:28:54.889 --> 03:28:56.724
CERTAINLY IF THERE IS. A SIGN OF

03:28:56.790 --> 03:28:58.325
A SAFETY CONCERN THEN CERTAINLY

03:28:58.392 --> 03:29:00.561
WE WANT TO ADDRESS THAT AND WE

03:29:00.628 --> 03:29:02.329
WANT TO BE SURE THAT WE MITIGATE

03:29:02.396 --> 03:29:03.764
THAT AND WE WILL BE DIFFERENT

03:29:03.831 --> 03:29:05.099
THAN OTHER STATES IF THAT'S

03:29:05.165 --> 03:29:06.333
WHAT'S NECESSARY IN ORDER TO

03:29:06.400 --> 03:29:08.035
PROTECT HIS ADDRESS AT SAFETY.

03:29:08.102 --> 03:29:08.669
BUT THIS POINT HAVE BEEN

03:29:08.736 --> 03:29:10.237
CHALLENGED IN TERMS OF FINDING

03:29:10.304 --> 03:29:12.740
THAT CONCERN. AND SO WITH THAT-

03:29:12.806 --> 03:29:14.541
WILL BE SUPPORTING- THIS BILL

03:29:14.608 --> 03:29:16.844
TODAY AND- SENATE GLAZER WHICH

03:29:16.911 --> 03:29:18.746
I'D LIKE TO CLOSE THE TICKET AT

03:29:18.812 --> 03:29:20.748

THAT I AM ALSO A DONOR- MANY

03:29:25.286 --> 03:29:26.787

03:29:26.854 --> 03:29:28.555
PATIENTS TO SAFETY REALLY IS THE

03:29:28.622 --> 03:29:30.291

THERE WAS ANY ENHANCE RISK I

03:29:35.162 --> 03:29:36.931
THINK WE WOULD ALL TAKE THAT

03:29:36.997 --> 03:29:38.799
SERIOUSLY. BUT THERE IS NO DATA

03:29:38.866 --> 03:29:39.366
THAT SHOWS THAT THERE IS A

03:29:39.433 --> 03:29:43.003
CONCERN- I WOULD NOTE THAT- IN

03:29:59.787 --> 03:30:01.322
THE NEED TO BE FILLED NO MORE

04:09:16.675 --> 04:09:17.709
SAYING THAT NOBODY'S HUNGRY IN

CONCERNS ME BECAUSE THAT'S

04:10:20.004 --> 04:10:21.172
BASICALLY OPEN ENDED THAT MEANS

04:10:21.239 --> 04:10:22.874
THIS MONEY CAN BE SPENT ON

YOUR BILL ABOUT BUILDING SECURE

04:10:34.719 --> 04:10:36.654
INFRASTRUCTURE CAN YOU DEFINE

04:10:36.721 --> 04:10:38.723
WHAT YOU MEAN BY THAT. WELL SURE

04:10:38.790 --> 04:10:42.193
WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE- ATTACKS

04:10:42.260 --> 04:10:45.964
MADE AGAINST PEOPLE WHO WORK IN

04:10:46.030 --> 04:10:49.267
CLINICS AND FACILITIES WHERE

04:10:49.334 --> 04:10:51.636
ABORTIONS ARE ACCESSIBLE. AND

04:10:51.703 --> 04:10:53.238
PART OF IT IS ABOUT MAKING SURE

04:10:53.304 --> 04:10:57.175
THAT PATIENTS AND CLINICIANS ARE

04:10:57.242 --> 04:11:00.545
SAFE WHEN THEY ARE GOING TO SEEK

04:11:00.612 --> 04:11:02.947

IT COULD BE REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH

04:11:05.517 --> 04:11:08.653
CARE ON THE SPECTRUM. SO WHAT

IN RIGHT NOW. IS THAT CORRECT.

04:11:19.764 --> 04:11:22.734
SO THAT WOULD BE OPEN TO YOUR

04:11:22.801 --> 04:11:24.335
POINT THAT THE PARTNERSHIP

04:11:24.402 --> 04:11:26.137

PROPAGANDA AGAINST- CLINICS THAT

OFFER ABORTION CARE OR ACCESS TO

04:11:53.932 --> 04:11:56.668
ABORTION CARE DOCTORS- OF THAT

04:11:56.734 --> 04:11:58.369
PROPAGANDA OR IS IT A DIFFERENT

04:11:58.436 --> 04:11:59.971
POINT OF VIEW WELL IT'S

04:12:00.038 --> 04:12:02.540
MISINFORMATION IF YOU SAY THAT

04:12:02.607 --> 04:12:04.242
X. OR Y. COULD HAPPEN IF YOU GO

04:12:04.309 --> 04:12:06.411
INTO THAT CLINIC THAT IS

04:12:06.478 --> 04:12:09.347
MISINFORMATION. OKAY WELL THAT'S

04:12:09.414 --> 04:12:11.983
OPEN TO INTERPRETATION-

PROVIDERS AND PATIENTS.

04:12:17.856 --> 04:12:19.057
PROVIDING MEDICALLY ACCURATE

04:12:19.123 --> 04:12:21.092
EDUCATION AND TRAINING TOOLS TO

04:12:21.159 --> 04:12:23.428
THE COMMUNITY- WHAT DOES THAT

04:12:23.495 --> 04:12:25.497
LOOK LIKE TO YOU PROVIDING

04:12:25.563 --> 04:12:27.332
MEDICALLY ACCURATE EDUCATION AND

04:12:27.398 --> 04:12:29.400
TRAINING TOOLS TO THE COMMUNITY

04:12:29.467 --> 04:12:31.603
IT LOOKS LIKE IN A CULTURALLY

04:12:31.669 --> 04:12:33.571
APPROPRIATE AND SENSITIVE WAY

04:12:33.638 --> 04:12:35.306
MAKING SURE THAT COMMUNITY

04:12:35.373 --> 04:12:38.009
MEMBERS HAVE ACCESS TO ACCURATE

04:12:38.076 --> 04:12:40.745
INFORMATION RELATIVE TO HOW THEY

04:12:40.812 --> 04:12:42.547
LIVE HOW THEY LOVE HOW THEY HAVE

04:12:42.614 --> 04:12:44.616
SEX HOW THEY TAKE CARE OF THEIR

04:12:44.682 --> 04:12:46.384
BODIES HOW THEY ENSURE THAT THEY

04:12:46.451 --> 04:12:49.554
ARE HEALTHY. BUT WE DON'T HAVE

04:12:49.621 --> 04:12:51.656
THAT ALREADY. IN SOME INSTANCES

04:12:51.723 --> 04:12:53.458
WE DON'T SOME COMMUNITIES MAY

04:12:53.525 --> 04:12:55.126
HAVE AN OVER ABUNDANCE OF THOSE

04:12:55.193 --> 04:12:57.328
RESOURCES OTHERS COMMUNITIES MAY

04:12:57.395 --> 04:12:59.998
NOT OR IT MAY NOT BE CONSISTENT

04:13:00.064 --> 04:13:02.267
FOR EXAMPLE. WE DO NOT HAVE

04:13:02.333 --> 04:13:04.369
CONSISTENT ACCESS TO CARE ON OUR

04:13:04.435 --> 04:13:06.404
SCHOOL CAMPUSES FOR K. THROUGH

04:13:06.471 --> 04:13:08.573
TWELVE STUDENTS SOME COMMUNITIES

04:13:08.640 --> 04:13:10.642
THAT MIGHT EIGHT HAVE. AN

04:13:10.708 --> 04:13:12.777
ABUNDANCE OF PRIVATE SCHOOLS ARE

04:13:12.844 --> 04:13:15.280
HIGHLY RESOURCE SCHOOL DISTRICTS

04:13:15.346 --> 04:13:17.148
MIGHT HAVE ACCESS TO CERTAIN

04:13:17.215 --> 04:13:20.218
CARE OTHER DISTRICTS MAY NOT. SO

04:13:20.285 --> 04:13:21.519
YOUR BILL THEN WOULD ALLOW

04:13:21.586 --> 04:13:23.555
FUNDING TO BE FUNNELED INTO THE

04:13:23.621 --> 04:13:24.923
SCHOOLS FOR THE PURPOSES OF

04:13:24.989 --> 04:13:26.724
PROVIDING ADEQUATE EDUCATION ON

04:13:26.791 --> 04:13:28.259
ATTAINING AN ABORTION I WAS

04:13:28.326 --> 04:13:30.828
USING AN EXAMPLE. ABOUT

04:13:30.895 --> 04:13:33.464
INCONSISTENCY AS IT RELATES TO

04:13:33.531 --> 04:13:35.500
ACCESS THIS IS ABOUT A PILOT

04:13:35.567 --> 04:13:39.037
PROGRAM FOR- ABORTION ACCESS TO

REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE NOT ON

04:13:41.005 --> 04:13:43.775
A SCHOOL CAMPUS WELL BUT I GUESS

04:13:43.841 --> 04:13:45.577
IT GOES BACK TO MY ORIGINAL

04:13:45.643 --> 04:13:47.378
QUESTION BECAUSE- IN THE BILL

04:13:47.445 --> 04:13:49.981
IT'S AS BUT NOT LIMITED TO. SO

04:13:50.048 --> 04:13:52.317
THE FUNDS COULD BE USED TO-

WHATEVER THE CASE MAY BE INTO

04:14:01.926 --> 04:14:04.796
THE SCHOOLS IN ORDER TO EDUCATE.

04:14:04.862 --> 04:14:08.633
KIDS ABOUT- ABORTION OR HOW TO

04:14:08.700 --> 04:14:10.568
GET IT OR WHAT'S MEDICALLY. I

04:14:10.635 --> 04:14:13.204
MEAN RIGHT BECAUSE IT'S AS BUT

04:14:13.271 --> 04:14:16.774
NOT LIMITED TO. WELL I MEAN I'M

04:14:16.841 --> 04:14:18.743
NOT LIMITED TO COULD INCLUDE A

04:14:18.810 --> 04:14:20.111
WHOLE BUNCH OF THINGS LIKE

04:14:20.178 --> 04:14:22.780
CREATING MATERIALS TO TELL YOU

04:14:22.847 --> 04:14:25.316
HOW YOU CAN GO TO MARS- BUT I

04:14:25.383 --> 04:14:26.884
WOULD POSIT THAT THAT'S NOT

ACCESS TO THESE RESOURCES

04:17:54.425 --> 04:17:55.526
