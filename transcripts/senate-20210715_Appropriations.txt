TO CONTINUE OPERATING OR PROVIDING SERVICES IT NO LONGER IS ABLE TO FINANCIALLY SUPPORT- SO THE CONCERN IS THAT THERE CAN BE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE. SAFETY OF THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH DOES ESTIMATE. OF POTENTIAL COST OF FOUR POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS UP FROM A SPECIAL. STATE HEALTH FACILITIES CITATION PENALTIES ACCOUNT FOR SIX MONTHS IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. AND THIS IS BASED ON THE ASSUMPTION OF THREE VOLUNTARY CLOSURES. OF INTERMEDIATE CARE FACILITIES. AND SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES BETWEEN NOW AND JULY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY TWO. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT WE'VE HEARD FOR FINANCE ANY QUESTIONS FROM MY COLLEAGUES. MISS BATES. YEAH ASSEMBLY MEMBER MURATSUCHI JUST A QUICK QUESTION ABOUT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S INVOLVEMENT YOU KNOW THAT THEY ARE ON THERE HAD BEEN AN OUTREACH TO THAT OFFICE BUT TO DATE I. HAVE NOT HEARD THAT THERE'S ANY RESPONSE IN TERMS OF THEIR ROLE IN ENFORCEMENT. OF ISSUES WITH NORTH WITH. ISSUES LIKE THIS YES THANK YOU SENATOR- WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO SPECIFICALLY ADDRESS THE PROVISIONS OF THE BILL THE BILL THAT DEALS WITH. THE IMPOSITION OF CONDITIONS OF SALE OF ACT OF HEALTHCARE FACILITIES FROM NONPROFIT TO FOR PROFIT- OWNERS. THE PARTICULAR- NURSING HOME IN ICF INVOLVED THAT THAT- INSPIRED THIS BILL- INVOLVED THAT KIND OF A SITUATION WHERE. THERE WAS A NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION THAT SOLD OUT FOR NURSING HOMES AND MEDICARE FACILITIES TO A. FOR PROFIT THAT FOR PROFIT. ANNOUNCED TO ALLOW YEAR THAT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE OF THE PANDEMIC THE LAST SEPTEMBER THAT THEY WANTED TO CONVERT- ONE OF THE FACILITIES INTO A- INTO LUXURY APARTMENTS AND- AND SO THAT IS THE- THE INVOLVEMENT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IN THIS. THE COMMISSION THANK YOU MISTER JONES HAS A QUESTION AS WELL THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MISTER MURATSUCHI A QUESTION AND CONCERN- YOUR YOUR WITH LEAD WITNESS AND DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ACTUALLY PICKED UP ON ON MY CONCERN AND THAT'S THE- ASSEMBLY APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE. PUT THE- FISCAL AFFECTED NEGLIGIBLE- BUT ALSO SAID ACTUAL COSTS ARE UNKNOWN. BUT POTENTIALLY COULD BE SIGNIFICANT DEPENDING ON A NUMBER OF FACILITIES THAT FILE FOR BANKRUPTCY BETWEEN. EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE BILL IN THE AND THE SUNSET AND THEN. AS WAS POINTED OUT A CITY PH CAME IN WITH AN ESTIMATE OF FOUR POINT- TWO MILLION DOLLARS- JUST WANTED TO KNOW IF YOU WANT TO SPEAK TO THAT DISPARITY IN THE- IN THOSEOPINIONS AND THE CONCERN IS. THAT THE ONLY EXEMPTION IS BANKRUPTCY DOES THIS NOT HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO FORCE. SOME OF THESE- FACILITIES IN THE BANKRUPTCY AND TO SEEK THAT PROTECTION THANK YOU SIR FOR YOUR QUESTION AS A- THE WITNESS IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL TESTIFIED TO. THESE NURSING HOMES AN INTERMEDIATE CARE FACILITIES THEY ARE BASICALLY GUARANTEED- AND COME WHETHER IT'S MEDICARE OR MEDICAID ALL IN TERMS OF THEIR THEIR CURRENT PATIENTS WHAT THIS BILL IS ASKING FOR IS A TEMPORARY. A TEMPORARY RELIEF THE TEMPORARY PEACE OF MIND FOR OUR MOST VULNERABLE- SENIORS- WE SAW THAT SENIORS LIVING IN NURSING HOMES DURING THE PANDEMIC AND ALL. HAVE BEEN AMONG THE MOST VULNERABLE DURING THE PANDEMIC AND IN FACT ACCOUNTED FOR ALMOST HALF OF ALL THE DOUBTS IN THE EARLY MONTHS OF THE OF THE PANDEMIC. THIS AGAIN I MEAN IT'S ONE IT IS WE LIMITED IT TO THE STATE OF EMERGENCY PERIOD- PUT BUT- TO ADDRESS CONCERNS RAISED IN THE SENATE HEALTH COMMITTEE THEY EVEN THEY THEY LIMITED THE- THE THEY THAT THEY SUNSET AT THE BILL UP FOR JULY FIRST OF NEXT YEAR AND SO. YOU KNOW WE BELIEVE THAT THE- NO LONGER RESPECT AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH- TO ADDRESS OUR CONCERNS- THAT THEY ARE. YOU KNOW PROJECTING A WORST CASE SCENARIO WHERE IF THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH WOULD HAVE TO INTERVENE WITH- WITH THE NURSING HOME OF ICY ALPS THAT- THAT MAY NOT BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO OPERATE WE. HAVEN'T SEEN YOU KNOW- MAY OF THIS- BANKRUPTCY OR VOLUNTARILY CLOSING DURING THE PANDEMIC- WE ARE ASKING FOR. THE BALANCING OF THE EQUITIES SO TO SPEAK IN IN IN TERMS OF.
