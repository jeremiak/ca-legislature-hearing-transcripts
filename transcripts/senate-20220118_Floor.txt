AS A STATE AUDITOR- IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA I RECOGNIZE AND- I THINK A LOT OF US IN OUR CONSTITUENTS RECOGNIZE THAT. MANY OF THE- GOOD POINTS OF CALIFORNIA GOVERNANCE- IS BECAUSE OF THE OVERSIGHT. THAT THE AUDITOR HAS BROUGHT TO BEAR. OVER HER TIME AS IS AS A STATE AUDITOR AND THE IMPROVEMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE IN THE DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS IN THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF STATE GOVERNMENT. AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS- THAT ISSUES LOOKED INTO AS WELL. ARE BECAUSE OF THE HONEST. AND FORTHRIGHT AND- CLEAR DIRECTION AND- PUT THINGS THAT SHE HAS POINTED OUT IN THESE AUDITS AND I MENTIONED- LAST YEAR THE YEAR BEFORE THE NEW GRAPHICS THAT THEY'RE USING IN THEIR REPORTS ARE INCREDIBLE- YOU KNOW I THINK THAT THAT BRINGS TO LIGHT AND MAKES IT EASY TO DIGEST SOME OF THESE REPORTS THAT ARE YOU KNOW VERY DETAIL ORIENTED- BUT I JUST WANT TO SAY PERSONALLY MISS HEALTH THANK YOU IT'S BEEN AN HONOR AND A PRIVILEGE TO WORK WITH YOU YOU ARE A CONSUMMATE PROFESSIONAL.

WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE TO THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THE STATE LEGISLATORS TO SELL RELY UPON YOU GODSPEED. THANK YOU SENATOR ALL. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT YOU KNOW IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE THAT IN DECEMBER OF THIS YEAR I WILL HAVE COMPLETED TEN YEARS ON THE- ON THE RED CARPET. I DISTINCTLY REMEMBER WALKING OUT OF THIS BUILDING THAT FIRST WEEK OF DECEMBER TWO THOUSAND TWELVE AND- TELLING MY POLITICAL TEAM. HOW FRIENDLY EVERYONE IN SACRAMENTO WAS AT WHICH POINT THEY LAUGHED AT ME. AND THEY PROBABLY TOLD ME THE SAME THING THAT OTHER FOLKS HAVE TOLD YOU. SENATOR IF YOU WANT A FRIEND TO GO GET A DOG. FIRSTLY I DIDN'T FIND THAT TO BE TRUE NOT IN THIS LEGISLATURE. AND CERTAINLY NOT IN THIS CHAMBER. AND NOT WITH MY FRIEND OUR STATE AUDITOR. ELAINE HOWLE. THE FIRST MEADOW LANE WHEN I WAS ASSIGNED. AS VICE CHAIR OF THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE AUDIT COMMITTEE IN ABOUT TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN. AND OVER THE NEXT SIX YEARS DURING MY TOUR IS VICE HERE ARE THE DISTINCT PLEASURE. WATCHING OUR STATE AUDITOR IN ACTION. I CAN HONESTLY SAY THAT IN ALL OF MY JOBS. IN THE MILITARY IN BUSINESS. IN LIVE NEVER HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF WORKING WITH THE PERSON MORE FOCUSED MORE HARD WORKING MORE PROFESSIONAL MORE PUBLIC SERVICE MINDED. AND MORE COURAGEOUS. THEN ELAINE HELL. SHE COULD CERTAINLY TALK TRUTH TO POWER. INFREQUENTLY DID FROM THE BOARD OF REGISTERED NURSING TO THE STATE BAR FROM DGS AND THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY TO CDC ARE FROM THE STATE LOTTERY IN FISCAL TO SEE ISSUE. WHEN YOU SEE AND THE ADMINISTRATION ITSELF. AND I GUESS I SHOULD ADD IN THE SECRETARY OF NATURAL RESOURCES. ALAIN TOOK THEM ON ALL OF THEM. PHRASES SUCH AS INADEQUATE OVERSIGHT SIGNIFICANT DELAYS BUDGET PRACTICES ARE MISLEADING FAILURE TO DISCLOSE TENS OF MILLIONS AND LACK OF TRANSPARENCY AND MANY OTHERS PEPPERED THE REPORT SHE ISSUED. CLEARLY ELAINE SPOKE AND THE REST OF US LISTENED. IN DOING SO SHE LIFTED ALL OF US UP AND MAKE THIS WORK JUST A LITTLE BIT HARDER. SHE WAS COMPLETELY DEVOTED TO HER JOB TO US AND TO THE PEOPLE OF THIS GREAT STATE. I RECALL A PARTICULARLY TURBULENT TIME FOR ELAINE THINK IT WAS IN ABOUT TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN. SHE WAS MOVING THROUGH THE REAPPOINTMENT PROCESS AS OUR STATE AUDITOR AND LYFT WAS NOT BEING PARTICULARLY KIND TO HER. ALESSER PERSON WOULD HAVE GIVEN UP. FRANKLY I THINK I WOULD HAVE WORK LEFT TO BE DONE THERE WERE PEOPLE LEFT TO SERVE AND THERE WERE THORNY ISSUES LEFT TO ADDRESS. OBVIOUSLY IT ALL WORKED OUT. SHE ACCEPTED THE REAPPOINTMENT THE CHALLENGES WERE RESOLVED UNFORTUNATELY FOR ALL OF US ELAINE CONTINUED HER EXTRAORDINARY PERFORMANCE AS OUR STATE AUDITOR. BUT FOR METHAT MOMENT IN TIME CLEARLY DEMONSTRATED THE TRUE MEASURE. OF ELAINE HOW AND THE TRUE MEANING OF THE PHRASE SERVICE BEFORE SELF. YOU KNOW FOR MANY OF US WE- SIMPLY PASSED THROUGH LIFE JENNIFER LUCKY IN THE END. WE'LL BE ABLE TO POINT TO ONE OR TWO THINGS WE TOUCH WHERE PERHAPS WE MADE AN IMPACT. BUT DURING THAT JOURNEY IF WE ARE REALLY VERY LUCKY. WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SERVE ALONGSIDE SOMEONE WHOSE WORK ACTUALLY CHANGE LIVES. WHOSE WORK DIRECTLY IMPACTED OUR COMMUNITIES AND CONSTITUENTS AND WHOSE WORK ACTUALLY MADE. OUR STATE A BETTER PLACE TO LIVE. IN MY CASE I DID. AND THAT PERSON WAS ELAINE HOW. SELAIN I CAN'T SEE YOU UP THERE BUT THANK YOU FOR SETTING THE BAR HIGH. THANK YOU FOR TOLERATING ME AS YOUR VICE CHAIR. AND THANK YOU FOR BEING MY FRIEND. THANK YOU SENATOR SENATOR LEVEL. WELL I THOUGHT I COULD TURN THAT AROUND IN EIGHT YEARS I HAVEN'T LEARNED THAT. STATE AUDITOR ELAINE HOWLE ONE OF MY PERSONAL HEROES WHEN I WAS ELECTED TO THE SENATE I'M EMBARRASSED TO SAY I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THERE WAS A THING AS A STATE AUDITOR. AND THEN I WAS PUT ON J. LACK AND I MET YOU. AND YOU ARE SO FASTIDIOUS AND IT'S ALWAYS THE FACTS MA'AM JUST THE FACTS. NEVER DOUBTED ANYTHING IN YOUR REPORTS BECAUSE YOU OVERTURNED EVERY POSSIBLE STONE. I GOT TO WHAT WE NEEDED WHAT FOR THE FACTS. WHEN I HEARD THAT YOU WERE RETIRING I'M OF COURSE HAPPY FOR YOU. BUT YOU ARE A GREAT LOSS TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER PRESIDENT MEMBERS UNDER CALIFORNIA'S GREEN CHEMISTRY PROGRAM- OF THE DEPARTMENT A TOXIC SUBSTANCE ROLL INCENTIVIZE HARMFUL CHEMICALS IN CONSUMER PRODUCTS WITH THE GOAL OF FINDING ALTERNATIVES IN DEVELOPING REGULATIONS DESIGNED TO PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH. UNFORTUNATELY AS WE DO WE HAVE THE SCREEN CHEMISTRY PROGRAMS NOW BEEN AROUND FOR MORE THAN A DECADE. AND NOT A SINGLE CHEMICAL IN A CONSUMER PRODUCT HAS BEEN SUBJECT TO REGULATORY RESPONSE UNDER THIS FRAMEWORK. THE PROGRAM HAS BEEN SLOW HI IS SO SLOW IN IN LARGE PART DUE TO DATA GAPS THAT HINDER INFORM DECISION MAKING IN THE INABILITY OF THE TSC. TO IDENTIFY CHEMICALS IN PRODUCTS WITHOUT DIRECTLY TESTING THEM OR DOING VERY TIME CONSUMING SEARCHES OR REQUESTS FOR DATA AND THERE'S A WHOLE REPORT ON THIS STATE THAT WE DRAFTED THIS BILL TO OUR RESPONSE TO- SO SAID SO THIS BILL SB FIVE OH TO IMPLEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS FROM. PUBLIC HEALTH INSTITUTES ANALYSIS OF THE GREEN CHEMISTRY PROGRAM UNDER THE GST TO IMPROVE ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY STREAMLINE PROCESSES AND GIVE THE DEPARTMENT AUTHORITY TO COLLECT ESSENTIAL PRODUCT INGREDIENT. DATA SPECIFICALLY THE BILL GRANTS DGSE CLEAR AUTHORITY TO OBTAIN PRODUCT AGREED DATA FROM MANUFACTURERS AND IF NEEDED. THE CHEMICAL SUPPLIERS REQUIRES THE DEPARTMENT TO ADOPT A SEVEN YEAR TIMELINE TO IDENTIFY AND ASSESS FIVE YEAR FIVE PRIORITY PRODUCTS INDUSTRY MINDS INFORMAL RESOLUTION APPEALS PROCESSES AND CREATES A FAST TRACK. PROCESS FOR WHEN EXISTING HIGH QUALITY STUDIES SUPPORT THE DEPARTMENT MOVING QUICKLY TO REGULATORY RESPONSIBLE TECH PUBLIC HEALTH. WE FIRST INTRODUCED THE BILL LAST SESSION WE WORKED WITH STAKEHOLDERS TO ADDRESS ALL CONCERNS RAISED BY THE OPPONENTS ARE VERY PLEASED TO SAY. THAT THE LANGUAGE OF THIS MEASURE REFLECTS THE COMPROMISE REACHED BETWEEN ALL STAKEHOLDERS IN THE BILL. HAS RECEIVED NO NO VOTED HAS NO OPPOSITION AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION DEBATE ON THIS ITEM ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM SENATOR TROUBLED. THANK YOU MESSAGE THREE THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT. I SEE THAT THIS BILL ALLOWS THE DTS SEEK TO IMPOSE FINES THAT CAN BE UP TO FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS PER DAY PER VIOLATION FOR ALLEGEDLY FAILING TO PROVIDE SPECIFIC INFORMATION TO THE D. T. S. C. WHILE I AGREE. THAT THEY SHOULD BE MAY ARE THAT WE SHOULD MAKE SURE THAT THE CALIFORNIA NOT BE EXPOSED TO DANGEROUS CHEMICALS I FEEL THAT A FIND COULD POTENTIALLY BE FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS ARE. BETTER FINE CAN POTENTIALLY BE FIFTY FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A DAY IS EXCESSIVE. SPECIALISES THE BILL SEEMS TO NOT PROVIDE ANY OPTION. FOR APPEAL. AB FOR THE FINE TO EITHER THE COURTS OR THE NEWLY CREATED BOARD OF ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY. WHICH IS TASKED WITH OVERSEEING THE DGSE. WITH ALL THAT IN MIND- HOW DID YOU COME UP WITH SUCH A HIGH FEE CAP IN WOULD YOU BE OPEN TO REDUCING IT- AND DO YOU ENVISION THERE BEING AN OPTION FOR PEOPLE TO APPEAL THE FINE. FOR BOCH CENTER HELLO YOU TAKE QUESTION HAVE YOU TAKE THE QUESTION THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR FOR THE QUESTION. YOU KNOW LOOK WE ARE THE THIS THERE'S A LONG NEGOTIATION THE CAME INTO PRODUCING THIS BILL- IN THE END OF THE DAY ARE YOU KNOW IT IT IS IT'S ARE STRONG WE GOT WE WERE TRYING TO GIVE SOME TEETH TO THE GREEN CHEMISTRY PROGRAM WE TOOK HIM IN IN LOTS AND LOTS OF INPUT FROM INDUSTRY IT'S WHY INDUSTRY IS NOT- IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL HI SO WE ARE WE'RE IN A PLACE WHERE WE REALLY WANT THERE TO BE SOME TEETH- IF A IF A PLAYER IS REPEATEDLY VIOLATING IS NOT PARTICIPATING IS NOT. BEING HELPFUL WE WANTED THERE TO BE SOME TEETH IN THE BILL HI TO ALLOW THE DEPARTMENT TO DO ITS JOB WHICH IS TO ENSURE THERE'S NOT DANGEROUS TOXIC CHEMICALS IN EVERYDAY PRODUCTS AS I SAY WE HAVE THIS BECOMES THE PROGRAM NOW FOR OVER A DECADE IN NOT A SINGLE THERE HASN'T BEEN A SINGLE MEANINGFUL REGULATORY ACTION TAKEN OR EVEN INVENT OR EVEN MEANINGFUL INVESTIGATION SO THAT'S WHAT THAT'S WHAT IT'S THERE FOR IT'S THERE TO GIVE THEM SOME SOME TEETH. ARE CERTAINLY HAPPY. TO TALK TO YOU I MEAN I YOU KNOW I. GET WE COULD TALK ABOUT A LOWER NUMBER- BUT BUT WHAT I DON'T WANT TO HAVE HAPPEN IS. IT THIS IS THEY SAY. VIA WE RESOLVE THE CORE CONCERNS OF THE FOLKS IN INDUSTRY. AND I JUST I DON'T WANT TO SEE US TAKE ACTION ON THE FLOOR TODAY THAT- THAT THEY THEY THEY MIGHT WEAKEN THE BILL AND HERE'S THE THING. SENATOR THE FOLKS WHO REPRESENT. ON THE MORE LEGITIMATE. OUR PLAYERS IN INDUSTRY I WERE FINE WITH THIS PARTLY BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO HELP BAD ACTORS- YOU KNOW THEY THEY THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT THE DATE YOU'RE THE FOLKS ARE PLAYING BY THE RULES. ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS THE MARKETS ARE A AND IN THE FOLKS THAT ARE BREAKING THE RULES ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE ADVANTAGES- AND THAT'S WHAT THIS FINE OF FORTY FOR EVENTUALLY DOES IT GIVES. THE DEPARTMENT THE ABILITY TO ENFORCE THE RULES WHICH AS I SAY INDUSTRY HAS AGREED TO SELL I ULTIMATELY IS ABOUT IT'S ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE ACROSS THE BOARD ACCOUNTABILITY. AND AND IF THE INDUSTRY PLAYERS THEMSELVES WHO IN THIS CASE WANT TO ENSURE THAT- THAT WE'RE NOT DOING ANYTHING THAT MIGHT HELP TO EMPOWER ABOUT ACTORS. IT SAYS FAR. QUESTION TO- OF TROUBLE CERTAINLY THANK YOU SENATOR BORDERS. THE PRESIDENT- QUESTION OF THE AUTHOR IF I MAY GENERALLY TAKE ANOTHER QUESTION YES HELLO. THANK YOU SO IT'S ONLY BECAUSE HE'S LEAVING AS SOON. SO THE DTS SEE- IF IN INTO GIVEN ANYWHERE FIND THE FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A DAY- WE'RE WITH THAT PENALTY GO WOULD GO TO THE T. S. C. OR WHERE WOULD THE MONEY GO. YEAH TYPICALLY- THERE'S A MECHANISM FOR THIS AND I'M I'M- IT. THERE THERE'S LIKE A FIND. YEAH RIGHT IS A DGSE FIND IT WOULD GO TO. I THEIR THEIR RULES THAT GOVERN. ITS USE IN BUT IT SEEMS LIKE SORT OF A TASK HE KNOWS MORE ABOUT THE KIND OF THE ACTUAL MECHANISM. OKAY I'LL WAIT FOR A CENTER WHAT COUNTS YOU TO MAKE A COMMENT- LAST QUESTION IS. IS IT THROUGH THE CHAIR OR THE PRESIDENT AGAIN- IS THERE A- OUT OF POCKET- CAPACITY IN THIS BILL. THAT WOULD ALLOW OUTSIDE PLAYERS TO INITIATE- THIS- FINANCIAL TRIGGER- IN A- IN A POP UP FORMAT. NO I DON'T I DON'T TO I DON'T THINK YOU'D SEE A NO OPPOSITION THIS BILL IF THERE WERE TWO SEVEN. YEAH NO NO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT ONLY THE DEPARTMENT COULD PURSUE. THANK YOU SENATOR VOTE. THANK YOU MISS PRESENT I DID HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE AUTHORED THAT BECAUSE OF THE GOOD SENATOR FROM THE VALLEY DIDN'T HAVE A MICROPHONE UP I DIDN'T HEAR WHETHER IT'S THE SAME QUESTION SO IF IT IS YOU DON'T HAVE TO ANSWER BUT I WAS CONCERNED USUALLY THERE IS AN APPEAL PROCESS AND I UNDERSTAND THE- COULD NOBLE INTENTION OF THIS BILL SOUTH FUNDING QUESTIONS BUT I DO THINK A PROCESS OF FULL VERY IMPORTANT. IN TERMS OF TRUST IN AN AGENCY WHEN HAVE SPECIFICALLY A BUREAUCRACY AND THEY GET TO LEVEL THE PINES AND THEY'LL FIND THAT DETERMINE WHETHER SOMEBODY OUT INTENTIONALLY VIOLATED LIKE THE BAD ACTORS DO BUT NOT HAVING AN APPEAL PROCESS WHEN YOU HAVE A BUREAUCRATIC PROCESS THAT THEY HAVE TO GO THROUGH IF TROUBLING. SO IS THERE A REASON THERE IS NOT AN APPEAL PROCESS AND IF YOU ALREADY ANSWERED THAT I APOLOGIZE. NO WE DIDN'T WE ACTUALLY INTO IT I MEAN WHAT I MEAN BECAUSE BROADLY SPEAKING IT IS. AS I SAY WE WERE ABLE TO SATISFY THE YOU KNOW THE COURT CONCERNS OF OUR FRIENDS IN INDUSTRY YOU. WORK IN THE SPACE. BOB YOU KNOW THERE IS THERE IS OBVIOUSLY YEAH THE DGSE HASTERT THERE THERE'S A PRETTY STRICT SET OF THE MINISTER OF OP PROCEDURES THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO FOLLOW- BEFORE. I IMPLEMENTING SOMETHING LIKE THIS BUT- I SUPPOSE IN THE END OF THE DAY IT'S JUST ABOUT IT'S YOU KNOW IF THE IF IT'S ENSURING THAT. THAT THIS PROGRAM ACTUALLY HAS TEETH YOU KNOW. I THINK THAT THE FEAR IS- AND I SAY THE FOLKS REPRESENT INDUSTRY ARE ARE ARE COMFORTABLE WITH THIS BILL. OUT BUT I THINK THE FEAR IS THAT THERE WILL BE A FEW ACTORS OUT THERE THAT WILL RUN THE PROCESS OUT. AND AND IF IT EVER MEMBERS JUST LET'S JUST REMEMBER THIS FEET OF FORTIES ONLY FOR DATA GATHERING. RIGHT SO IF YOU'RE THIS IS JUST ABOUT ENSURING. THAT THE THAT THAT THAT THE PLAYERS WHO ARE BEING REGULATED THIS PROGRAM ACTUALLY SHARING. THEIR DATA HIS LISTED OUT IN THE IN THE IN THE IN THE RECOMMENDATIONS THE REPORT AND IN THIS BILL. SO I HEAR YOU- BUT YOU KNOW IT BUT- IT BUT THERE THERE THERE THERE IS A- YEAH WHAT BE THE BILL TALKS ABOUT HOW THE- DEPARTMENT WOULD HAVE TO- YOU HAVE TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT. ARE THE NATURE OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES THE EXTENT OF THE VIOLATION HISTORY OF PREVIOUS VIOLATIONS. ON THE VIOLATOR'S ABILITY TO PAY THE PENALTY- THE DETERRENT EFFECT OF THE PENALTIES ARE ALL THINGS OF THE DEPARTMENTS TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT. IN MAKING THIS DECISION. I HAD. YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY IF THERE IF THEY WERE INTERACTING IN SOME KIND OF ARBITRARY AND CAPRICIOUS MANNER THERE'D BE A WAY. TO HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE THAT THIS WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT WE YEAH THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT. THAT THAT COULD BE ADDRESS ANOTHER WAY BUT I GUESS I WANTED BUT I DON'T WANT TO HAVE HAPPEN. IS NOW GO ANOTHER TWENTY YEARS WHERE EVERY GROUP KNOWS THAT THEY CAN JUST. APPEAL ARE WHEN IT WHEN THERE'S BEEN A WISE DECISION MADE BY THE BY THE DEPARTMENT AND ALL THE SUDDEN WE'RE TWENTY YEARS LATER WHENEVER TWO DECADES AND- AND ONCE AGAIN THERE'S NOT A SINGLE THING IS HAPPENING TO THE GREEN CHEMISTRY PROGRAM. I THANK YOU FOR THEIR DOUBTS ON MY OWN TIME- COLLEAGUES I. BECOME MORE MORE TROUBLED WITH THE AMOUNT. OF THE THIRTY THAT'S DELEGATED FROM. OUR LEGISLATIVE BODY AND I THINK SPECIFICALLY CALLED OUT IN. A PROPOSED REGULATIONS OF A PROCESS THAT MUST BE FOLLOWED. IN A DOZEN BECOME DISCRETIONARY ON THE PART OF A VERY LARGE BUREAUCRACY. WHO HAVE. INCREDIBLE AUTHORITY TO FOR TO FIND. AN INDIVIDUAL. COMPANY OR- WHOEVER FIVE FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A DAY. SO WITHOUT AN APPEAL PROCESS. OF FOR. SOMEONE WHO'S MADE OF SOME SORT OF A LAFAYETTE AND MINISTRY TO MISTAKE. IT FOR A VERY TROUBLING SO I THINK WHAT I'LL DO TODAY BECAUSE I BELIEVE. THAT THE INTENT HERE IS VERY. IMPORTANT THAT WITHOUT SOME UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESS C. AS IN IT. THE FAIR ENOUGH THAT'S BUILT INTO THAT- I'D GET ABSTAINED TODAY UNTIL I CAN TAKE. A LITTLE CLOSER LOOK AT THAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM. SENATOR KABIR. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT- I HAD NO INTENTION OF STANDING UP AND SPEAKING TODAY BUT- I JUST WANT TO TALK REAL BRIEFLY ABOUT THE REASON THAT THE GREEN CHEMISTRY COUNCIL WAS SET UP BECAUSE- I WHILE I AGREE THAT IN MANY INSTANCES I GET CONCERNED WITH THE AMOUNT OF AUTHORITY THAT WE GIVE TO OUR REGULATORY. ENTITIES I'M PRETTY MUCH UNFETTERED TO ADOPT REGULATIONS AND THEN TO IMPOSE THEM I DO GET CONCERNED ABOUT THAT AT TIMES THIS SITUATION IS REALLY DIFFERENT THE GREEN CHEMISTRY COUNCIL IS LOOKING AT AND ANALYZING CHEMICALS THAT WHEN PRODUCED INTO A PRODUCT ARE DETRIMENTAL TO THE HEALTH AND WELL BEING EITHER OF CHILDREN OR PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY AND THE REASON THAT THE GREEN CHEMISTRY COUNCIL WAS SET UP IN THE FIRST PLACE SO WITH ALL DUE RESPECT FOR THE CONCERNED ABOUT INADVERTENT ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESSES THAT'S JUST NOT GONNA HAPPEN IN THIS INSTANCE IT JUST ISN'T YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE PUTTING IN YOUR PRODUCTS YOU KNOW WHETHER IT HAS. CANCEROUS IMPACTS OR CAN CAUSE OTHER DISRUPTION OF THE- OF THE BODILY FUNCTIONS- THAT'S WITH THE GREEN CHEMISTRY COUNCIL WAS SET UP FOR AND THE REASON IS BECAUSE BACK IN THE DAY. THOSE THAT THE CHEMICAL **** COMPOSITIONS WOULD COME TO THE A AND I WAS IN THE ASSEMBLY AT THE TIME SO COME TO THE LEGISLATURE. AND WE WERE ASKED TO DETERMINE WHETHER WE SHOULD BAN THE USE OF THAT PARTICULAR CHEMICAL IN A PARTICULAR PRODUCT AND I NEVER SAT ON ANY OF THE COMMITTEES. THAT DID THE REVIEW OF THESE CHEMICALS AND YET THE BILL WOULD COME TO THE FLOOR AND I'D HAVE TO DECIDE WHETHER TO BAN THEM PERMANENTLY FROM ANY PRODUCT THAT WOULD COME INTO CALIFORNIA. IT WAS A VERY VERY DIFFICULT TASK AND IT REQUIRED US TO KNOW SOME PRETTY SOPHISTICATED SCIENCE INFORMATION WHICH IS WHY IT'S AT THE CHEMISTRY COUNCIL WAIT WE DECIDED THAT WE NEEDED A COUNCIL. OF EXPERTS THEY COULD LOOK AT THIS INFORMATION AND MAKE THE DECISION AND NOT HAVE IT COME TO THE FLOOR EVERY SINGLE- TIME THAT THERE WAS A CONCERN ABOUT CHEMICALS SO I'M GONNA SUPPORT THIS BILL I AM APPALLED THAT IN TEN YEARS THERE'S BEEN NO ADMINISTRATIVE ACTION TAKEN- EIGHT IT SAYS TO ME THERE'S A PROBLEM- HOPEFULLY. THIS WILL HELP TO RESOLVE SOME OF THAT SOME OF THOSE ISSUES BUT- BUT REALLY WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT IF. IF A PRODUCT GETS INTO PRODUCTION AND COMES TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT WE'RE PROTECTING- ARE RESIDENTS SINCE I WANT TO APPLY- MY GOOD SENATOR- FOM SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA I THINK HE'S DONE A GREAT JOB ON THIS HE WORKS REALLY HARD ON THESE AND THE FACT THAT THERE ISN'T. A GREAT OPPOSITION FROM ON THE THOSE THAT ARE REGULATED INDICATES THAT THERE'S A SWEET SPOT HERE AND I WANT TO ASK THAT YOU VOTE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. THANK YOU ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THE SIDE ON SENATOR BACK. THANKS I JUST WANTED TO TALK VERY BRIEFLY I TRY FIRST ACTIVISM EVER WAS ON THE TOXIC USE REDUCTION ACT IN MASSACHUSETTS BUT WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE AND THEN THE C. WORKER pTHE COMMUTER RIGHT TO KNOW ACT SO I DID NOT KNOW ACTUALLY. AT ALL REALLY ABOUT THE GREEN CHEMISTRY COUNCIL THE WORK HAD BEEN DONE BUT I THINK THE EVIDENCE SPEAKS FOR ITSELF TWELVE YEARS. WITHOUT A ENFORCEMENT ACTION OR TO HAVE THE EFFECT THAT SHOWS THAT WE NEED TO MAKE THESE CHANGES AND I WANT TO COMMEND THE AUTHORED I'M PROUD TO SUPPORT THIS BILL. THANK YOU ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. ON THE SIDE OF. THE FOR THE DISCUSSION OF RIGHTS HERE IN CHINO IN. GENERAL TO LOOK CLOSE APPRECIATE THE ROBUST DISCUSSION WEEK WE HAVE BEEN WORKING HARD TO GET TO THE SWEET SPOT THAT THEY MIGHT. MY FRIEND FROM- FROM SALINAS I SUGGEST. YOU KNOW TO REALLY THIS DECISION- IS A IT'S A YES OR NO QUESTION AS O WHETHER YOU PROVIDE THE DATA. AS AS- OUTLINED BY THE BILL- WE WORK CLOSELY WITH INDUSTRY ON THIS- THEY THEY FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH THE BILL. THIS IS ULTIMATELY ABOUT IMPROVING EFFICIENCY SO THAT WE- CAN MAKE SURE THE PRODUCTS ARE SAFER- IT'S ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT THIS CREE CHEMISTRY PROGRAM WHICH- WHICH WAS LAUNCHED WITH SO MUCH PROMISE. ACTUALLY HAS. SOME YOU KNOW IS IT HAS AS SOME AS SOME REAL. ENFORCEMENT POWER. AND SO I WANT TO THINK THE ALL THE SENATORS WHO SPOKE UP AND FOR THE ROBUST DISCUSSION. AND I JUST APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT FOR THIS MEASURE THAT WILL. MAKE OUR PRODUCTS SAFER. THANK YOU. THE ANSWER TO PLEASE GO THE ROLL ON FILE TWENTY NINE.

DUTY ZERO EMISSION TRUCKS IN ORDER TO ME CALIFORNIA'S CLIMATE AIR QUALITY IN THE REMISSION VEHICLE GOALS. EMISSIONS FROM THESE TRUCKS MAKE UP A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF HARMFUL AIR POLLUTION FOR EXAMPLE HEAVY DUTY TRUCKS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ABOUT 35% OF THE TOTAL STATEWIDE KNOCKED EMISSIONS. WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN I. ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM SENATOR NEWMAN. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT THAT I RISE IN SUPPORT OF SB FIVE FOUR TWO AND I COMMEND MY COLLEAGUE FROM SANTA BARBARA FOR BRING IT FORWARD. AS YOU'RE AWARE CALIFORNIA HAS ARTICULATED AMBITIOUS GOALS TOWARD REPUBLIC REDUCING OUR GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. AND SETTING AGGRESSIVE BUT ACHIEVABLE STANDARD FOR THE REST OF THE COUNTRY TO EMULATE ON THE WAY TOWARD CREATING THE KIND OF CLEAN. AN INNOVATIVE ECONOMY THAT THE CURRENT CLIMATE CRISIS DEMANDS. A KEY ELEMENT OF A LARGER PLAN IS A MANDATE TO THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD THROUGH GOVERNOR NUISANCE EXECUTIVE ORDER AND SEVEN NINE TWO ZERO. TO DEVELOP POLICIES TO TRANSITION ALL MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES TO ZERO EMISSIONS. BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE THIS IS. CHOSEN FOR MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY TRUCKS GENERATE A SIGNIFICANT SHARE OF HARMFUL AIR POLLUTION ACROSS THE STATE. EACH YEAR. BY WAIVING THE THREE POINT 9% A STATE SALES TAX FOR THE PURCHASE OF ZERO EMISSIONS TRUCKS SB FIVE FOUR TWO WILL FACILITATE THE TRANSITION. TO CALIFORNIA'S MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY VEHICLE FLEETS SUCCESSFULLY TRANSFORMING THE SECTOR TRANSPORTATION BY INCENTIVIZING THE PURCHASE. OF ZERO EMISSION TRUCKS OFFERS HUGE POTENTIAL FOR MITIGATING THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND IMPROVING AIR QUALITY ESPECIALLY FOR CALIFORNIA'S MOST IMPACTED. COMMUNITIES IT'S IMPORTANT CONSIDER THAT WHEN YOU PURCHASE A ZERO EMISSIONS BATTERY ELECTRIC VEHICLE A LARGE PART OF THE UP FRONT COST. IS FOR THE POWER IN THAT VEHICLE THAT COSTS ESPECIALLY MORE THAN OFFSET. BY THE REDUCED FUTURE COSTS ABOUT MAINTENANCE AND FUEL. WHEN THE REPLACEMENT IF YOU BUY BATTERIES OR FUEL CELLS IS THE MECHANISM FOR ELIMINATION OF GREENHOUSE GAS CREATED BY CONVENTIONAL VEHICLES. DEVISING MARKET BASED APPROACHES TO ELIMINATING SUCH UP FRONT COST BARRIERS. IS KEY TO BUILDING THE DECARBONISATION BY TRANSPORTATION SECTOR. AND WILL ENABLE MORE CALIFORNIANS TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS TRANSITION.

I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO AND I KNOW EVERYBODY IS WORKING ON A RENEWABLE ENERGY AND BUT THESE ARE- HEAVY DUTY DIESEL TRUCKS THAT TRANSPORT GOODS AND SERVICES AND I THINK THIS BILL UNILATERALLY- TRIES TO CHANGE THE WAY THAT CALIFORNIA WOULD OPERATE IN TRANS PORTING TESE GOODS- HAS THERE BEEN A STUDY DONE ON THE SIDE EFFECTS I GUESS YOU A COLUMN OR THE. THE THINGS THAT WE WILL HAVE TO DEAL WITH IF THIS BILL PASSES AND THE COSTS THAT WILL BE BORNE BY INDIVIDUALS WHO TRANSPORT THESE GOODS WHICH WILL ESSENTIALLY GO ON TO THE CONSUMER HAS THERE BEEN A STUDY DONE ON THE COST AND THE SIDE EFFECTS OF.

WITH ALREADY INFLATION RISING TREMENDOUSLY THESE COSTS WILL BE PASSED ON TO THE CONSUMER. THE PEOPLE. IN YOU KNOW EIGHT DOLLARS FOR BACON VERSUS THREE DOLLARS FOR BACON.

THIS TRANSPORTATION COSTS IS GOING TO HURT OUR CONSTITUENTS AT. ASPIRIN WILL THE INTO BE. GET A STEADY. TO FIND OUT HOW MUCH THIS IS GOING TO AFFECT THE COST OF REGULAR DATE FOOD ITEMS.

THAT HE WOULD HAVE SAY IN THOSE CONTRACTS OR WHAT HIS DIALOGUE WOULD BE BUT JUST AS IMPORTANT WHAT HIS ROOM WARDROBE WOULD BE HE INSISTED ON WARREN FIFTEEN HUNDRED DOLLAR SUITS SO EVERY TIME YOU SAW MISTER FORTY EIGHT IN A MOVIE. HE WAS ONE OF FIFTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS SUIT THAT TODAY WOULD PROBABLY BE CLOSE TO A FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR SUIT AND ALL THE MOVIES TO THIS- STUDIOS AGREE WENT ON BECAUSE HE WAS THE BIGGEST BOX OFFICE DRAW. AT THAT TIME AND HE A EXTREME- NEGOTIATING RIGHTS BECAUSE THEY KNEW HOW POWERFUL HE WAS AS FAR AS A BOXOFFICE DRAW WAS CONCERNED. AND AS STATED. IN NINETEEN SIXTY SEVEN. HE DID THROUGH THE MOST POWERFUL MOVIES NOT FOR AFRICAN AMERICANS BUT FOR ALL AMERICANS AND THAT IS GUESS WHO'S COMING TO DINNER TO SIR WITH LOVE IN THE HEAT OF THE NIGHT ONE OF THE CONDITIONS ON THE HEAT OF THE NIGHT WAS IN FEMININE PIECES I WILL NOT GO DOWN SOUTH OF THE MASON DIXON LINE BECAUSE OF WHAT HAD BEEN STATED BY MY COLLEAGUE WHO REPRESENTS A DISTRICT HE HAD BEEN SHOT AT. HE AND HARRY BELAFONTE AND HE INSISTED THAT HE WOULD NOT. GOAL SOUTH OF THE MASON DIXON LINE SO. THE TOWN OF SEPARATE- SUPPORTER I SHOULD SAY DAX IN THE MOVIE THIS IS PART OF MISSISSIPPI IT'S REALLY FAILED IN ILLINOIS' AND- THE FILM THAT IN ILLINOIS' BUT IT CAME TO A POINT IN THE MOVIE WHERE THEY DID NEED TO GO SOUTH. BECAUSE THEY NEEDED A SCENE IN THE COTTON FIELDS. AND BAY NEGOTIATED AND STUDY GOING TO MISSISSIPPI THEY WANT TO TENNESSEE- BUT IN GOING TO TENNESSEE THEY MADE SURE MR BELAFONTE WAS WELL PROTECTED. AT ALL SECURITY THAT HE NEEDED AND EVEN THE- PRODUCER AND THE DIRECTOR SAID. I WILL PROTECT YOU. I'M SORRY THAT. BUT I THINK IT'S MOST IMPORTANT ROLE PEOPLE FILLED UNDERSTAND IS THAT. HE PRETTY MUCH. HELPED BANKROLL THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT. IN THE FIFTIES AND THE SIXTIES THIS MAN PUT HIS CAREER AND HIS LIFE ON THE LINE TO STAND WITH DR KING. AND STAND WITH ALL THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT- LEADERS OF THAT TIME. IF YOU CAN SEE AND MANY OF THE MAJOR EVENTS IS A MARCH ON WASHINGTON YOU NAME IT. HARRY BELAFONTE SYDNEY PORTILLA A- SAMMY DAVIS JUNIOR. THEY WERE THERE. AND CITY CITY PARTY A WAS THE REASON WHY MANY OF THEM SHOWED UP JACKIE ROBINSON BECAUSE HE WAS THE FIRST TO SAY THAT IN AS- MY COLLEAGUE STATED HE WAS A MAN WITH LIMITED EDUCATION. HE DROPPED OUT OF SCHOOL AT THE AGE OF THIRTEEN WITH ONLY A YEAR AND A HALF OF FORMAL EDUCATION. BUT HE WAS PROBABLY THE ONE MOST ELOQUENT SPEAKERS EVER- ONE OF THE MOST ARTICULATE AND- ONE OF THE MOST DIGNIFIED AND HUMBLE. AND I REMEMBER THE OPPORTUNITY I HAD TO MEET MISTER BROWN- PORTILLA. AND EVERYBODY'S RUNNING AROUND. PERMISSION AROUND AT THE AREAS SAID NORMAN A CORNER IN THE BACKYARD ALL BY HIMSELF THIS UNASSUMING WAS A BIG EVENT FOR BARACK OBAMA AND I MADE MY WAY OVER THERE AND HE WAS IS GRACIOUS AND KIND. AND I'LL NEVER FORGET IT AND HE WAS A HUMBLE SPIRIT SO I'M JUST WANT TO STAND HERE AND PRECIADO ALL THAT MR BELAFONTE DID NOT ONLY. AS AN ACTOR BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY AS HUMAN MANDATARIO AS A INDIVIDUAL WHO STOOD UP FOR CIVIL RIGHTS FOR ALL PEOPLE OF ALL COLORS. AND HIS LEGACY WILL LIVE ON THE FAR BEYOND THE SILVER SCREEN BUT WHAT HE DID AND FELT TO MENTION ALSO. TEN YEARS AS THE U. S. I MEAN- BAHAMIAN- AMBASSADOR TO JAPAN. NOW A LOT OF FOLKS DON'T KNOW THAT HE WAS IT AND- **** TO JAPAN REPRESENTING THE BAHAMAS FOR TEN YEARS SO. HE WAS A DIPLOMAT- A LEGACY OF A MOVIE STAR BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY JUST. HUMBLE AND KIND INDIVIDUAL SO I SAID WE'D GERMAN AND MEMMIUS. MISS SYDNEY PORTILLA. THANK YOU CENTER BRADFORD CENTERS BE SURE HIS NAME IS FOR A FOUR SO CAN BE PROBABLY MEMORIALIZED AT CALIFORNIA STATE SENATE. MEMBERS WE'RE RETURNING TO PRIVILEGES OF THE FLOOR SENATOR WIENER THE FLOOR IS YOURS. BUT. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT OUR COLLEAGUES I RISE TODAY AS VICE CHAIR OF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE JEWISH CAUCUS- TO EXPRESS OUR COMMUNITIES HORROR DISCUSSED AND FEAR REGARDING THE ATTACK ON CONGREGATION BETH ISRAEL AND COLLEYVILLE TEXAS. ANTISEMITISM SOMETIMES REFERRED TO AS THE OLDEST TEACHER IT REARED ITS UGLY AND DESTRUCTIVE IN VICIOUS HAD YET AGAIN ON SATURDAY. I THINK THERE ARE TWO IMPORTANT THINGS TO NOTE HERE. ONE WHICH IS SURPRISING AND ONE WHICH IS NOT. THE FIRST THE PART THAT'S NOT SURPRISING. THAT THE WAY THAT THE ATTACKER GOT INTO THE SYNAGOGUE. WAS BECAUSE THE RABBI INVITED HIM AND BECAUSE HE LOOKED LIKE HE WAS IN DISTRESS AND IN NEED. THE RABBI SHOWED WILL RECALL TO CRIMINAL LAW I'M HEALING THE WORLD WHICH IS A CORE PILLAR OF JUDAISM. THAT WE MUST BE THERE FOR OUR FELLOW HUMAN BEINGS. AND THE ROB I INVITED HIM AND EVEN THOUGH HE WAS A PERSON WHO WAS POTENTIALLY GOING TO KILL THE RABBI AND MEMBERS OF HIS CONGREGATION. THE PART THAT IS SURPRISING IS THE WAY THAT THIS ENDED YES THANK YOU TO LAW ENFORCEMENT FOR BEING THERE AND FOR PRIORITIZING. OUR COMMUNITY. IT ENDED BECAUSE THE RABBI AND ONE OF THE CONGREGANTS HAD SECURITY TRAINING. AND SO THEY WERE ABLE TO FREE THEMSELVES AND ESCAPE BEFORE LAW ENFORCEMENT ONE N. THAT'S GREAT. THAT'S FANTASTIC ALL WE SAVE LIVES BUT YOU MIGHT ASK YOURSELF TRAINING. RABBIS ARE MANY FAMOUS FRIENDS TEACHERS SPIRITUAL ADVISERS. MANY MANY THINGS SECURITY EXPERTS IS NOT PROBABLY THE FIRST THING THAT COMES TO MIND WHEN YOU THINK OF A RABBI. THE REASON THIS RABBI AND ONE OF THE CONGREGANTS HAD SECURITY TRAINING. THAT'S BECAUSE IN THIS MODERN WORLD OF OURS. THAT TRAINING IS NOW ESSENTIAL FOR JEWISH INSTITUTIONS IT'S NOT OPTIONAL. IT'S ESSENTIAL. AND WHEN YOU GO TO SYNAGOGUE AND HAVE TO WALK THROUGH A METAL DETECTOR. IN SAN FRANCISCO OR IN OTHER PARTS OF THIS COUNTRY AROUND THE WORLD. YOU SEE THAT FIRST HAND. BECAUSE THE JEWISH COMMUNITY. CONTINUES TO BE UNDER ATTACK HERE IN THIS COUNTRY. AND AROUND THE WORLD. SYNAGOGUES JEWISH COMMUNITY CENTERS RICHARD GROCERY STORES JEWISH DAY SCHOOLS ALL OF THESE INSTITUTIONS ARE UNDER THREAT AND HAVE BEEN ATTACKED NINETY TEN YOU TO BE ATTACKED. THIS HAY AND THE VIOLENCE IS NOT NEW IT IS THOUSANDS OF YEARS OLD THAT'S WHY IT IS SOMETIMES REFERRED TO. AS THE OLDEST HATRED. AND IT IS STILL WITH US. OUR COMMUNITY IS STILL BEING SYSTEMATICALLY TARGETED. WITH VIOLENCE. WE ONLY HAVE TO LOOK AT IT HISTORY GOING THROUGH TODAY TO SEE WHAT THIS MEANS FOR JEWS THROUGHOUT HISTORY OUR COMMUNITY HAS BEEN EXPELLED FROM COUNTRY AFTER COUNTRY AFTER COUNTRY WE'VE BEEN SUBJECT TO FORCED CONVERSIONS. WE CAN BLAME FOR PANDEMICS WHETHER IT'S THE BUBONIC PLAGUE IN THE MIDDLE EAST AS WE WERE BLAMED FOR THAT WORKOVER NINETEEN. WE'VE BEEN SUBJECT TO PERON'S THE DESTRUCTION OF ENTIRE VILLAGES IN EASTERN EUROPE THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY MY FAMILY. CAME TO THIS COUNTRY AND I IMAGINE OTHER FAMILIES OF THE JEWISH MEMBERS OF THIS LEGISLATURE. SUBJECT TO MASSACRES FORCED RELOCATION INTO GHETTOS OF THAT HAS HAPPENED THROUGHOUT HISTORY GENOCIDE. AND THE TARGETING OF OUR INSTITUTIONS WITH VIOLENCE. WITH SWASTIKAS AND WITH OTHER VANDALISM WE SEE IT ON SOCIAL MEDIA. CONSTANTLY ANTI SEMITISM JUST CASUAL ANTISEMITISM ON SOCIAL MEDIA WE SEE IN OUR POLITICS TODAY IN THIS COUNTRY AND AROUND THE WORLD. WHERE PEOPLE WHO ARE RUNNING FOR OFFICER INVOLVED IN THE POLITICAL SYSTEM FEEL LIBERATED TO ATTACK JEWS. COLLEAGUES IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET WE PASSED A DRAMATIC INCREASE IN CALIFORNIA'S SECURITY NONPROFIT SECURITY GRANT PROGRAM BUT I WANT TO THANK MEMBERS OF THIS BODY AND THE ASSEMBLY AND THE GOVERNOR FOR MAKING THAT HAPPEN WE INCREASED AT THE FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS. AND THAT IS IT DOES A LIFESAVING DOLLARS FOR SYNAGOGUES OR CHURCHES AND MOSQUES FOR COMMUNITY CENTERS AND SO FORTH. BUT I HAVE TO SAY THAT EVEN THOUGH OUR JEWISH CAUCUS IS COMPLETELY COMMITTED TO CONTINUING. TO EXPAND AND TO RENEW THAT PART OF MONIES THAT ARE COMMUNITIES INSTITUTIONS AND OTHER COMMUNITIES INSTITUTIONS. ARE SAFE. BUT I HAVE TO SAY IT IS DEEPLY TRAGIC FOR OUR LEGISLATIVE JEWISH CAUCUS THERE'S SO MANY THINGS THAT WE NEED TO BE WORKING ON IT IS SO TRAGIC THAT THE TOP PRIORITY FOR OUR CAUCUS EVERY YEAR. IS FUNDING NONPROFIT SECURITY GRANTS OF ALL THE THINGS THAT THE JEWISH COMMUNITY WANTS TO WORK ON AND NEEDS TO WORK ON SUPPORTING CHILDREN SENIORS MAKING SURE THAT EVERYONE HAS FOOD ON THE TABLE. MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE THE HOMELESSNESS OF ALL THE THINGS THAT RISES TO THE TOP WIDE. BECAUSE OUR COMMUNITY IS LITERALLY UNDER PHYSICAL DURESS. IT'S A TRAGEDY BUT WE ARE COMMITTED TO THAT WORK. I WANT TO THANK MEMBERS OF THIS BODY WHO'VE BEEN SO SUPPORTIVE OF OUR COMMUNITY AND PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN SPEAKING OUT AGAINST THE ATTACKS ON OUR COMMUNITY. ANTISEMITISM MAY BE THE OLDEST HATRED. BUT NOTHING LASTS FOREVER. AND WE NEED TO ALL RECOMMIT TO ENDING AT ONCE AND FOR ALL THANK YOU. THANK YOU. MEMBERS IF THERE'S NO OTHER BUSINESS INTERACTIONS THE DOSES CLEAR MISTER PRESIDENT THANK YOU SO MUCH COLLEAGUES THANK YOU ALL AND THE OUR NEXT FOOR SESSION IS SCHEDULED FOR THIS THURSDAY JANUARY TWENTIETH TWENTY TWENTY TWO AT NINE AM.
