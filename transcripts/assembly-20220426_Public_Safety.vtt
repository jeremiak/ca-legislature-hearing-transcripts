A CRIME HAS BEEN COMMITTED

01:39:51.952 --> 01:39:53.220

APART IN ORDER TO PROVIDE

01:46:12.365 --> 01:46:14.101
THIS SERVICE BUT SAME TIME WE

01:46:14.167 --> 01:46:15.635
WANT TO CAPTURE THE LARGEST

01:46:15.702 --> 01:46:17.571
NUMBER VEHICLES NIGHT I ALMOST

01:46:17.637 --> 01:46:19.606
DON'T GO A DAY IN MY OFFICE

01:46:19.673 --> 01:46:21.041

CONSIDER THE COST OF ETCHING

01:46:30.117 --> 01:46:32.319
OR -- PROVIDING THAT BEEN ON

01:46:32.385 --> 01:46:33.920
A CALCULATOR WE SHOULD ALSO

01:46:33.987 --> 01:46:35.822
CONSIDER THE ONE THOUSAND TO

01:46:35.889 --> 01:46:36.990
FOUR THOUSAND DOLLAR COST OF

ADDRESSING EITHER RIGHT RIGHT

01:46:41.361 --> 01:46:42.963
SO NO I'M NOT AGAINST TRYING TO

01:46:43.830 --> 01:46:45.632
FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO SOMETHING

01:46:45.699 --> 01:46:47.334
ABOUT IT BECAUSE IT IS A HUGE

01:46:47.400 --> 01:46:49.169

01:47:04.117 --> 01:47:05.452
ALL OF THE ABOVE IS ON THE

01:47:05.519 --> 01:47:07.220

02:14:03.001 --> 02:14:05.637
WITHOUT AN ATTORNEY THIS IS VERY

02:14:05.704 --> 02:14:07.572
UNCOMMON AS YOU KNOW THE VAST

02:14:07.639 --> 02:14:09.241
MAJORITY OF CRIMINAL DEFENDANTS

02:14:09.307 --> 02:14:10.442
RECEIVE THE ASSISTANCE OF

02:14:10.509 --> 02:14:13.245
COUNSEL SECOND TO THE JUDGE

02:14:13.311 --> 02:14:14.746
WOULD HAVE TO FIND THAT HAVING

02:14:14.813 --> 02:14:16.515
TO TESTIFY IN A COURT ROOM

02:14:16.782 --> 02:14:19.117
WOULD HAVE TO SO SUBSTANTIAL

02:14:19.851 --> 02:14:21.420
HAVING A SUBSTANTIAL EFFECT ON

02:14:21.486 --> 02:14:22.621
THE SURVIVOR THAT THEY WOULD

02:14:22.687 --> 02:14:24.923
BE UNAVAILABLE AS A WITNESS

02:14:24.990 --> 02:14:26.658
UNLESS THEY ARE ABLE TO TESTIFY

02:14:26.725 --> 02:14:29.394
REMOTELY TO THAT END WHEN WE

02:14:29.461 --> 02:14:30.796
TALK ABOUT THE IMPACT ON THE

02:14:30.862 --> 02:14:32.230
SURVIVOR IT IS IMPORTANT THAT

02:14:32.297 --> 02:14:33.532
WE WERE STATE THE ELEMENTS

02:14:33.598 --> 02:14:35.834
OF CRIMINAL STALKING FIRST

02:14:35.901 --> 02:14:37.335
THE DEFENDANT IS ALLEGED TO

02:14:37.402 --> 02:14:39.371
HAVE REPEATEDLY HARASSED OR

02:14:39.438 --> 02:14:41.873
FOLLOWED THE SURVIVOR SECOND

02:14:41.940 --> 02:14:43.241
THE PERPETRATOR ALLEGEDLY

02:14:43.308 --> 02:14:45.177
MADE A CREDIBLE THREAT PLACING

02:14:45.243 --> 02:14:46.812
THE SURVIVOR IN FEAR OF THEIR

02:14:46.878 --> 02:14:49.014
SAFETY OR THE SAFETY OF THEIR

02:14:49.080 --> 02:14:51.283

BEEN REPEATEDLY HARASSED OR

02:14:53.051 --> 02:14:54.486
FOLLOWED BY A STRANGER AND

02:14:54.553 --> 02:14:56.655
THEN THREATENED BY THAT PERSON

02:14:56.888 --> 02:14:58.123
HOW WOULD YOU FEEL HAVING TO

02:14:58.190 --> 02:14:59.491
ANSWER QUESTIONS FROM THAT

02:14:59.558 --> 02:15:00.759
SAME PERSON WELL THEY WERE

02:15:00.826 --> 02:15:02.394
STANDING JUST A FEW FEET

02:15:02.461 --> 02:15:03.995
AWAY FROM YOU IN A COURT ROOM

02:15:05.564 --> 02:15:07.032
NO ONE SHOULD BE FORCED TO

02:15:07.098 --> 02:15:08.667
GO THROUGH THAT NOW LET'S

02:15:08.733 --> 02:15:10.268
TURN TO WHETHER REMOTE

02:15:10.335 --> 02:15:12.070
TESTIMONY IS ALLOWABLE UNDER

02:15:12.137 --> 02:15:13.138
THE SIXTH AMENDMENT OF THE

02:15:13.205 --> 02:15:15.006
UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION

02:15:15.440 --> 02:15:17.275
THE ANSWER IS CLEARLY YES

THE CASE LAW BOTH THE PRIM

02:15:20.679 --> 02:15:22.180
CORE OF THE UNITED STATES IN

02:15:22.247 --> 02:15:23.849
OUR OWN STATE COURT IS VERY

02:15:23.915 --> 02:15:26.418
CLEAR REMOTE TESTIMONY IS

02:15:26.485 --> 02:15:27.919
PERMISSIBLE UNDER THE SIXTH

02:15:27.986 --> 02:15:29.921
AMENDMENT SO LONG AS REMOTE

02:15:29.988 --> 02:15:31.423
TESTIMONY WILL FULFILL AN

02:15:31.490 --> 02:15:34.192
IMPORTANT PUBLIC POLICY INTEREST

02:15:34.793 --> 02:15:36.328
SO THE IMPORTANT QUESTION

02:15:36.394 --> 02:15:38.263
POSED TO THIS COMMITTEE BY AB

02:15:38.330 --> 02:15:40.665

AND MANY OTHER LEGAL CONTACTS

02:15:55.447 --> 02:15:56.982
IT IS APPARENT THAT OUR STATE

02:15:57.048 --> 02:15:58.183
HAS ALREADY FOUND THE STATE

02:15:58.250 --> 02:16:00.519

TESTIMONY IN THIS BILL IS NOT

02:16:24.643 --> 02:16:26.611
AN INNOVATION FOR TWO REASONS

02:16:27.145 --> 02:16:28.680
FIRST EXISTING LAW ALREADY

02:16:28.747 --> 02:16:30.415

PROCEDURES AS THIS EXISTING LAW

FOR A JUDGE TO STEP IN AND

02:17:47.959 --> 02:17:50.028
ACT WE SHOULD NOT BE IN THE

02:17:50.095 --> 02:17:52.764
BUSINESS OF ALLOWING A DEFENDANT

TESTIFY VIA CCTV THE IMPORTANT

02:19:59.057 --> 02:20:00.625
THING TO FOCUS ON AND WHY

02:20:00.692 --> 02:20:02.260
THIS IS ALLOWED AND WHY IT IS

02:20:02.327 --> 02:20:04.496
CONSTITUTIONAL IF WHAT ARE BILL

02:20:04.562 --> 02:20:06.397
ALREADY PROVIDES WHICH SHOWS

02:20:06.464 --> 02:20:07.499
THAT THERE IS AN IMPORTANT

02:20:07.565 --> 02:20:09.167
PUBLIC POLICY INTEREST IN

02:20:09.234 --> 02:20:11.703
PROTECTING STALKING VICTIMS AND

02:20:11.770 --> 02:20:13.471
THEN THE SECOND THING IS THERE

02:20:13.538 --> 02:20:15.373
HAS TO BE A FINDING THAT IT IS

02:20:15.440 --> 02:20:17.642
NECESSARY IN THAT PARTICULAR

02:20:17.709 --> 02:20:20.211
CASE AND SO THAT IS ALREADY

02:20:20.278 --> 02:20:22.514
BUILT INTO OUR PENAL CODE

02:20:22.580 --> 02:20:23.915
PENAL CODE SECTION THIRTEEN

02:20:23.982 --> 02:20:26.718
FORTY SEVEN -- THOSE FACTIONS

02:20:26.785 --> 02:20:28.920
THAT ALREADY WE HAVE -- THAT

02:20:28.987 --> 02:20:30.555
APPLIED FOR OTHER VICTIMS WE

02:20:30.622 --> 02:20:32.557
ARE SIMPLY MIRRORING THOSE

02:20:32.624 --> 02:20:34.826
SAME REQUIREMENTS AND SO WE ARE

02:20:34.893 --> 02:20:36.728
ALREADY HEARING TO THE RULES WE

02:20:36.795 --> 02:20:38.396
ARE HEARING TO THE CONSTITUTION

02:20:38.463 --> 02:20:40.131
AND WE ARE REQUESTING A VERY

02:20:40.198 --> 02:20:42.133
NARROW EXCEPTION FOR A GROUP

02:20:42.200 --> 02:20:44.135
OF VICTIMS ON WHO ARE NOT

02:20:44.202 --> 02:20:46.871
INCLUDED AND THIS PROTECTION

02:20:46.938 --> 02:20:48.940
IS NECESSARY BECAUSE STOCKING

02:20:49.007 --> 02:20:51.142
IS ONE OF THE MOST EMOTIONALLY

02:20:51.209 --> 02:20:53.111
AND PSYCHOLOGICALLY TRAUMATIZING

02:20:53.178 --> 02:20:55.446
CRIMES THAT CAN RESULT IN

02:20:55.513 --> 02:20:57.649
LASTING IMPACTS AFTER THE

02:20:57.715 --> 02:20:59.250
ACTUAL TIME CRIME HAS BEEN

02:20:59.317 --> 02:21:03.021
COMMITTED AND IT INHERENTLY

02:21:03.087 --> 02:21:04.889
INHERENTLY REQUIRES THAT THE

02:21:04.956 --> 02:21:06.925
VICTIMS HAD BEEN TRAUMATIZED

02:21:06.991 --> 02:21:08.660
ALREADY BASED ON THE DEFENDANT'S

02:21:08.726 --> 02:21:11.095
ACTIONS AND UNWANTED CONTACT

02:21:12.597 --> 02:21:15.500
SO -- WITH ME HERE TODAY --

02:21:15.767 --> 02:21:17.368
AND BEFORE -- BEFORE SHE DID SHE

02:21:17.435 --> 02:21:19.003

02:21:19.070 --> 02:21:21.339
OPPOSITION THEY HAVE FILED CASE

02:21:21.406 --> 02:21:23.741
LAW AGAINST THIS AND I I JUST

02:21:23.808 --> 02:21:25.210
WANNA MAKE SURE IT'S CLEAR THAT

02:21:25.276 --> 02:21:27.278
THOSE CASES ARE DISTINGUISHED

02:21:27.579 --> 02:21:30.048
-- BECAUSE AS LONG AS YOU HAVE

02:21:30.114 --> 02:21:31.950
THAT NECESSARY FINDING THAT

02:21:32.016 --> 02:21:34.219
REQUIREMENT THAT IT IS NECESSARY

02:21:34.285 --> 02:21:36.321
IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE WHICH

02:30:04.261 --> 02:30:05.930
TODAY I AM SPEAKING ON BEHALF

02:30:05.996 --> 02:30:08.366
OF THE ACLU CALIFORNIA ACTION

02:30:08.766 --> 02:30:10.601
IN REGRETFUL OPPOSITION TO THIS

02:30:10.668 --> 02:30:13.104
BILL WE UNDERSTAND AND

02:30:13.170 --> 02:30:14.872
APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S GOALS OF

02:30:14.939 --> 02:30:17.174
PROTECTING SURVIVORS OF STOCKING

02:30:17.508 --> 02:30:19.210
AND WE DO NOT WISH TO DIMINISH

02:30:19.276 --> 02:30:21.445
THESE GOALS BUT THESE CONCERNS

02:30:21.512 --> 02:30:23.114
MUST BE BALANCED AGAINST

02:30:23.180 --> 02:30:24.648
THE RIGHTS OF THE DEFENDANTS

02:30:24.715 --> 02:30:25.983
AND THE STATE'S INTEREST

02:30:26.050 --> 02:30:27.618
AN ACCURATE FACT FINDING

02:30:28.886 --> 02:30:31.389
THE US CONSTITUTION GUARANTEES

02:30:31.455 --> 02:30:32.790
THAT IN ALL PRIVATE CRIMINAL

02:30:32.857 --> 02:30:34.759
PROSECUTIONS THE ACCUSED SHALL

02:30:34.825 --> 02:30:36.794
ENJOY THE RIGHT TO BE CONFRONTED

02:30:36.861 --> 02:30:38.496
WITH WITNESSES AGAINST THEM

02:30:39.296 --> 02:30:40.664
THE RIGHT OF CONFRONTATION HAS

02:30:40.731 --> 02:30:42.700
LONG BEEN CONSIDERED ONE OF THE

02:30:42.767 --> 02:30:44.969
FUNDAMENTAL GUARANTEES OF LIFE

02:30:45.035 --> 02:30:46.871
AND LIBERTY THE U. S. SUPREME

02:30:46.937 --> 02:30:49.306
COURT HAS NOTED THAT FACE TO

02:30:49.373 --> 02:30:51.675
FACE CONFRONTATION ENHANCES THE

02:30:51.742 --> 02:30:54.111
ACCURACY OF FACT FINDING BY

02:30:54.178 --> 02:30:56.313
REDUCING THE RISK THAT A WITNESS

02:30:56.380 --> 02:30:58.015
WILL WRONGFULLY IMPLICATE AN

02:30:58.082 --> 02:31:00.084
INNOCENT PERSON AND THE COURT

02:31:00.151 --> 02:31:01.585
HAS BEEN CLEAR THAT THIS RIGHT

02:31:01.652 --> 02:31:03.554
SHOULD BE LIMITED ONLY IN NARROW

02:31:03.621 --> 02:31:06.590
CIRCUMSTANCES FOR THIS REASON

02:31:06.657 --> 02:31:08.159
CALIFORNIA HAS HISTORICALLY

02:31:08.225 --> 02:31:10.161
BEEN VERY CAUTIOUS ABOUT

02:31:10.227 --> 02:31:12.296
ENACTING LEGISLATION THAT COULD

02:31:12.363 --> 02:31:13.764
UNDERMINE THE CRIMINAL FACT

02:31:13.831 --> 02:31:15.800
FINDING PROCESS OR INADVERTENTLY

02:31:15.866 --> 02:31:17.902
LEAD TO WRONGFUL CONVICTIONS

02:31:18.702 --> 02:31:20.471
AB SEVENTEEN NINETIES BROAD

02:31:20.538 --> 02:31:22.506

02:31:22.573 --> 02:31:24.341
WITH THIS PREVIOUS APPROACH

02:31:26.811 --> 02:31:27.178
I'M

02:31:29.647 --> 02:31:31.649
THE CURRENT STATUTE EXPLICITLY

02:31:31.715 --> 02:31:34.218
LIMITS THE USE OF THE PROCEDURE

02:31:34.285 --> 02:31:36.854

EVEN THEN ONLY IN SPECIFIED

02:31:42.126 --> 02:31:44.361
CIRCUMSTANCES WHEN FACED

02:31:44.428 --> 02:31:45.796
WITH THE PREVIOUS PROPOSAL TO

02:31:45.863 --> 02:31:47.898
EXPAND THE STATUTE TO INCREASE

02:31:47.965 --> 02:31:49.633
THE AGE TO EVEN FIFTEEN THAT

02:31:49.700 --> 02:31:51.168
THE LEGISLATURE SPECIFICALLY

02:31:51.235 --> 02:31:53.170
REJECTED THE PROPOSAL AND

02:31:53.237 --> 02:31:54.705
INSTEAD DREW THE LINE AT

02:31:54.772 --> 02:31:57.007
THIRTEEN DETERMINING THAT AGE

02:31:57.074 --> 02:31:58.509
TO BE THE APPROPRIATE AGE AT

02:31:58.576 --> 02:32:00.377
WHICH TO LIMIT THE STATUTE

02:32:01.045 --> 02:32:03.380
IN CONTRAST THIS BILL TODAY

02:32:03.447 --> 02:32:05.616
WOULD EXPAND TO ANY AGE

02:32:06.217 --> 02:32:08.052
NOTABLY THE LINE OF THIRTEEN

02:32:08.118 --> 02:32:10.421
APPEARS IN MULTIPLE STATUTES

02:32:10.488 --> 02:32:11.922
THE STATE HAVING CHOSEN TIME

02:32:11.989 --> 02:32:14.191
AND TIME AGAIN TO TREAT CHILDREN

FOR COMMENTS MISTER CORK

02:33:18.689 --> 02:33:20.558
I HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE ACLU

02:33:21.258 --> 02:33:23.627
-- THE PERSON --

02:33:24.194 --> 02:33:26.630
TESTIFYING FOR THE BILL

02:33:27.031 --> 02:33:29.366
SAID THAT YOU CAN ONLY GET

02:33:29.433 --> 02:33:30.768
THIS PROTECTION OF REMOTE

02:33:30.834 --> 02:33:33.270
TESTIMONY IF THERE'S CLEAR AND

02:33:33.337 --> 02:33:36.040
CONVINCING EVIDENCE OF THAT

02:33:36.106 --> 02:33:37.408
THE PERSON WOULD BE HARMED

02:33:38.375 --> 02:33:39.843
-- IS THAT THE WAY YOU

02:33:39.910 --> 02:33:42.079
READ THE BILL AND IF SO

02:33:42.413 --> 02:33:43.647
WHY DO YOU OBJECT TO THAT

02:33:47.985 --> 02:33:49.520
-- I DO READ THE BILL AS

02:33:49.587 --> 02:33:52.623
PROVIDING -- IT AS

02:33:52.690 --> 02:33:54.725
A CASE BY CASE ANALYSIS

02:33:55.092 --> 02:33:56.527
WHICH OF COURSE IS AN

02:33:56.594 --> 02:33:58.262
APPROPRIATE APPROACH

02:33:58.596 --> 02:34:00.731
UNFORTUNATELY THIS BILL IS TOO

02:34:00.798 --> 02:34:02.933
BROAD IN ITS APPLICATION AS

02:34:03.000 --> 02:34:04.168
MY COLLEAGUE SAID WHERE THIS

02:34:04.234 --> 02:34:05.569
HAS BEEN CONSIDERED BEFORE

02:34:05.636 --> 02:34:08.305
IT HAS BEEN FOR CHILDREN WHO

02:34:08.372 --> 02:34:11.141
POSE A PARTICULAR VULNERABILITY

02:34:11.208 --> 02:34:13.177
-- IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES

02:34:13.577 --> 02:34:15.579
AND FACED PARTICULAR HARMS AND

02:34:15.646 --> 02:34:18.082
HAVING TO TESTIFY IN

02:34:18.148 --> 02:34:21.585
PERSON THIS BILL IS DIFFERENT

02:34:21.652 --> 02:34:23.220
THAN THESE PREVIOUS APPROACHES

02:34:23.287 --> 02:34:24.755
AND THAT IT WOULD EXPAND

02:34:25.155 --> 02:34:26.790
THIS PROCEDURE TO PEOPLE OF

02:34:26.857 --> 02:34:28.859
ANY AGE AND AS MY COLLEAGUE

02:34:28.926 --> 02:34:30.260
SAID THERE IS CONCERN THAT

02:34:30.327 --> 02:34:32.730
THIS WILL OPEN THE DOOR TO

02:34:32.796 --> 02:34:34.632
ADDITIONAL EXPANSIONS WHEN THIS

02:34:34.698 --> 02:34:36.033
IS A RIGHT THAT HAS BEEN VERY

02:34:36.100 --> 02:34:37.868
CAREFULLY AND CAUTIOUSLY LIMITED

02:34:37.935 --> 02:34:39.603
BY THE COURTS AND BY THIS

02:34:39.670 --> 02:34:42.840
LEGISLATURE IN THE PAST --

02:34:43.273 --> 02:34:45.676
WELL I WELL TWO THINGS

02:34:45.743 --> 02:34:47.211
ONE IS YEAH CLEARLY THE CASE

02:34:47.277 --> 02:34:48.512
FOR CHILDREN IS DIFFERENT I

02:34:48.579 --> 02:34:50.547
UNDERSTAND THAT BUT IF THERE'S

02:34:50.614 --> 02:34:52.850
CLEAR AND CONVINCING EVIDENCE

02:34:52.916 --> 02:34:55.753
THAT THE WITNESS WOULD BE HARMED

02:34:56.553 --> 02:34:59.790
-- BY GIVING IN PERSON TESTIMONY

02:35:00.257 --> 02:35:01.692
-- ISN'T THAT A REASON TO

02:35:01.759 --> 02:35:04.328
ALLOW THEM TO TESTIFY REMOTELY

02:35:06.296 --> 02:35:07.598
UNFORTUNATELY I THINK THE

02:35:07.665 --> 02:35:10.234
ANSWER IS NO -- THE CRIMINAL

02:35:10.300 --> 02:35:12.436
PROCESS IS VERY DIFFICULT IT

02:35:12.503 --> 02:35:14.138
IS VERY DIFFICULT FOR WITNESSES

02:35:14.204 --> 02:35:15.439
IT IS VERY DIFFICULT FOR

02:35:15.506 --> 02:35:17.074
SURVIVORS IT IS VERY DIFFICULT

02:35:17.141 --> 02:35:19.176
FOR DEFENDANTS AND NOT AS PART

02:35:19.243 --> 02:35:20.878
OF THE NATURE OF OUR EXISTING

02:35:20.944 --> 02:35:23.747
CRIMINAL SYSTEM -- AND WE CANNOT

02:35:23.814 --> 02:35:26.950
SEEK TO A ROAD THIS ESTABLISHED

02:35:27.017 --> 02:35:30.821
SYSTEM -- WHEN SURVIVORS

02:35:30.888 --> 02:35:33.424
-- ARE ARE HARMED OR

02:35:33.791 --> 02:35:36.326
FACE HARM BY HAVING TO TESTIFY

02:35:36.527 --> 02:35:38.062
AND IT'S AGAIN NOT TO DIMINISH

02:35:38.128 --> 02:35:40.664
THAT HARM NOT TO DISRESPECT

02:35:40.731 --> 02:35:42.900
THE EXPERIENCE OF SURVIVORS

02:35:43.300 --> 02:35:45.636
BUT THE RIGHTS OF DEFENDANTS

02:35:45.903 --> 02:35:47.771
AND THIS LONG ESTABLISHED

02:35:47.838 --> 02:35:49.339
RIGHT TO CONFRONTATION OF

02:35:49.406 --> 02:35:52.609
ONE'S ACCUSERS -- OUTWEIGHS

02:35:52.976 --> 02:35:55.979
THOSE -- THOSE HARMS

02:35:56.046 --> 02:35:57.981
SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS

02:35:58.515 --> 02:36:01.552
WILDER'S -- NEEDS TO BE CLEAR

02:36:01.618 --> 02:36:03.721
AND CONVINCING EVIDENCE YOUR

02:36:03.787 --> 02:36:05.656
FEELING IS THAT THIS WOULD

02:36:05.723 --> 02:36:07.091
REDUCE WELL AND I BELIEVE

02:36:07.157 --> 02:36:08.258
YOU'RE RIGHT IT WHICH PROBABLY

02:36:08.325 --> 02:36:09.426
SPREAD TO OTHER THINGS

02:36:09.493 --> 02:36:11.862
BESIDES THIS BUT YOU'RE SAYING

02:36:11.929 --> 02:36:14.698
THAT MOST WITNESSES --

02:36:15.933 --> 02:36:17.735
ARE SHAKEN BY THE PROCESS

02:36:17.801 --> 02:36:19.169
AND SO YOU COULD END UP WITH

02:36:19.236 --> 02:36:20.804
MOST WITNESSES TESTIFIED

02:36:20.871 --> 02:36:23.107
REMOTELY IS THAT THE CONCERN

02:36:25.309 --> 02:36:27.344
-- I YOU KNOW I CAN'T SAY IF IF

02:36:27.411 --> 02:36:29.113
MOST WITNESSES ARE ARE SHAKEN

02:36:29.179 --> 02:36:30.914
BUT WE NEED WE DO KNOW THAT

02:36:30.981 --> 02:36:32.983
THAT TESTIFYING EVEN TESTIFYING

02:36:33.050 --> 02:36:34.785
IN COMMITTEE CAN BE IT CAN BE

02:36:35.152 --> 02:36:37.387
DIFFICULT A DIFFICULT --

02:36:37.621 --> 02:36:39.790
EXPERIENCE FOR LOTS OF PEOPLE

02:36:40.424 --> 02:36:42.359
AND YET OUR CRIMINAL LEGAL

02:36:42.426 --> 02:36:44.895
SYSTEM IS IS BUILT ON THIS

02:36:44.962 --> 02:36:47.030
NOTION OF CONFRONTATION --

02:36:47.097 --> 02:36:49.833
EVEN WHEN IT IS UNCOMFORTABLE

02:36:49.900 --> 02:36:52.302
EVEN WHEN IT IS HARMFUL --

02:36:52.369 --> 02:36:53.237
AND WHERE THERE HAVE BEEN

02:36:53.303 --> 02:36:54.905
EXCEPTIONS IT HAS BEEN LIMITED

02:36:54.972 --> 02:36:57.975
TO CHILDREN -- WHO ARE

02:36:58.208 --> 02:37:00.010
AS WE ALL RIGHT NOW I UNDERSTAND

02:37:00.677 --> 02:37:02.546
VULNERABLE ALL RIGHT THANK YOU

02:37:04.114 --> 02:37:05.516

FOR BRINGING FOR THIS BILL

02:37:09.653 --> 02:37:11.355
I KNOW THAT IN THIS SPEND AT

02:37:11.421 --> 02:37:13.857
CHALLENGING I MY SENSE IS THAT

02:37:13.924 --> 02:37:16.660
-- THIS IS ACTUALLY VERY VERY

02:37:16.727 --> 02:37:19.496
NARROWLY DEFINED -- AS

02:37:19.563 --> 02:37:21.265
IT RELATES TO PRO PER DEFENDANTS

02:37:21.331 --> 02:37:22.065
THERE HAS TO BE CLEAR AND

02:37:22.132 --> 02:37:24.434
CONVINCING EVIDENCE AND -- THE

02:37:24.501 --> 02:37:27.171
VERY NATURE OF THE OF THE

02:37:27.237 --> 02:37:29.106
EDUCATE OF OF THE CRIME THAT'S

02:37:29.173 --> 02:37:31.275
BEING ADJUDICATED HAS TO DO WITH

02:37:31.341 --> 02:37:33.443
BEING IN THE PRESENCE OF THE

02:37:33.510 --> 02:37:36.013
WITNESS -- I THINK IT'S IRONIC

02:37:36.079 --> 02:37:38.582
QUITE FRANKLY THAT WE'RE HEARING

02:37:38.649 --> 02:37:40.984

LIKE THE FACT THAT IS SO VERY

02:37:52.062 --> 02:37:54.798
NARROWLY TAILORED MATTERS TO ME

02:37:55.299 --> 02:37:57.568
-- IT ALSO MATTERS TO ME THAT

02:37:57.634 --> 02:38:00.170
I DO THINK THAT A TECHNOLOGY

02:38:00.237 --> 02:38:02.039
AND COVE IT HAS SHOWN US THAT

02:38:02.406 --> 02:38:04.107

02:38:12.482 --> 02:38:14.351
USING THE TECHNOLOGY REMOTE

02:38:14.418 --> 02:38:15.586
TECHNOLOGY TO BE ABLE TO DO

02:38:15.652 --> 02:38:18.555
SELL -- AND I DO HAVE A CONCERN

02:38:18.622 --> 02:38:20.390
AS WE ALL SHOULD ABOUT THE

02:38:20.457 --> 02:38:22.259
SIXTH AMENDMENT -- AND THE

02:38:22.326 --> 02:38:24.695
CONFRONTATION CLAUSE TO I THINK

02:38:25.128 --> 02:38:27.798
THE CASE FIVE DEMONSTRATES

02:38:27.865 --> 02:38:28.932
AND KIND OF SHOWS THAT THERE

02:38:28.999 --> 02:38:31.001
ARE TWO COMPONENTS OF THAT ONE

02:38:31.068 --> 02:38:33.270
AROUND FACE TO FACE -- INNER

02:38:33.337 --> 02:38:35.105
AT BEING ABLE TO CONFRONT FOR

02:38:35.172 --> 02:38:36.573
A FACE TO FACE AND THE OTHER

02:38:36.640 --> 02:38:39.009
AROUND CROSS EXAMINATION AND

02:38:39.076 --> 02:38:41.211
-- AND I DO THINK THAT THERE

02:38:41.278 --> 02:38:43.380
IS AN ALLOWANCE WITH REMOTE

02:38:43.780 --> 02:38:45.449
-- IN THIS NARROWLY TAILORED WAY

02:38:45.515 --> 02:38:48.151
TO STILL BE ABLE TO HAVE THAT --

02:38:49.186 --> 02:38:52.089
THAT'S AT EXPERIENCE

02:38:52.155 --> 02:38:53.323
OF FACE TO FACE EVEN THOUGH

02:38:53.390 --> 02:38:55.058
IT IS REMOTE -- AS WE'VE

02:38:55.125 --> 02:38:56.460
DEMONSTRATED THROUGHOUT

02:38:56.827 --> 02:38:58.262
-- THROUGHOUT KOPET AND SO

02:38:58.328 --> 02:38:59.730
FOR THOSE REASONS I WILL BE

02:38:59.796 --> 02:39:01.498
SUPPORTING THIS BILL AND I

02:39:01.565 --> 02:39:03.333
WANTED TO ADD THANK YOU FOR

02:39:04.134 --> 02:39:05.168
BRINGING FORWARD SOMETHING

02:39:05.235 --> 02:39:06.770
THAT I THINK QUITE HONESTLY

02:39:06.837 --> 02:39:08.372
WILL BE SOMETHING THAT THE

02:39:08.438 --> 02:39:10.641
COURTS WILL HAVE TO TAKE INTO

02:39:10.707 --> 02:39:13.510
CONSIDERATION AND -- AND WE

02:39:13.577 --> 02:39:14.411
WILL LEARN MORE THROUGHOUT THE

02:39:14.478 --> 02:39:15.579
PROCESS BUT I THINK AT THIS

02:39:15.646 --> 02:39:17.848
POINT I DO THINK THAT IT'S

02:39:18.248 --> 02:39:20.083
A VALUABLE FOR OUR COMMUNITY

02:39:20.150 --> 02:39:21.285
TO PASS IT THROUGH TO THE

02:39:21.351 --> 02:39:22.986

I DO WANT TO DISCLOSE BY STATING

02:39:38.769 --> 02:39:40.537
IN A WHILE THE CONFRONTATION

02:39:40.604 --> 02:39:42.940

FOR FACE TO FACE CONFRONTATION

02:39:44.942 --> 02:39:46.076
IT IS A PREFERENCE I MUST

02:39:46.143 --> 02:39:47.778
OCCASIONALLY GIVE WAY TO

02:39:47.844 --> 02:39:50.247
CONSIDERATION A PUBLIC POLICY

THE NECESSITIES OF THE CASE

02:39:52.950 --> 02:39:54.584
AND THE SUPREME COURT OF THE

02:39:54.651 --> 02:39:56.320
UNITED STATES SAID UNEQUIVOCALLY

02:39:56.386 --> 02:39:57.654
THAT THE COMPETITION CLASSES

02:39:57.721 --> 02:39:59.056
NOT PROVIDE AN ABSOLUTE RIGHT

02:39:59.122 --> 02:40:00.891
TO FACE TO FACE CONFRONTATION

02:40:01.391 --> 02:40:02.926

DISCUSSION ABOUT ABOUT JUDGES

02:40:29.052 --> 02:40:30.787

WITH GIVING THEM THAT KIND OF

02:41:29.246 --> 02:41:31.782
LATITUDE ALMOST OPENING IT UP TO

02:41:31.848 --> 02:41:34.384
THREE STRIKES KIND OF --

THREE STRIKES -- JUDGES WOULD

02:41:56.840 --> 02:41:59.743
HARSH BUT NOT ONLY ON STOCKERS

02:41:59.810 --> 02:42:01.945
BUT -- ALLEGED STALKERS THEY

02:42:02.012 --> 02:42:03.613
WOULD HAVE BEEN UNBELIEVABLY

02:42:03.680 --> 02:42:05.382
HARSH ON THEM AND THEY WOULD

IT IS AND IF IT ISN'T THEN

02:42:45.856 --> 02:42:47.157

03:02:34.777 --> 03:02:35.811
COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR ANY

03:02:35.878 --> 03:02:38.981
QUESTIONS MISTER EXACTLY

03:02:39.882 --> 03:02:41.817
YEAH THERE ARE DEFINITELY

03:02:41.884 --> 03:02:43.319
SOME VERY SUPPORTABLE ASPECTS

03:02:43.385 --> 03:02:44.720
OF THIS THIS PARTICULAR

03:02:44.787 --> 03:02:46.889
PROPOSAL AND THIS BILL AND

03:02:46.955 --> 03:02:48.324
I I DO APPRECIATE THE FACT

03:02:48.390 --> 03:02:50.492
THAT WE'RE ADDRESSING IT --

03:02:51.827 --> 03:02:54.163
I ROUTE REGRETFULLY I'M NOT

03:02:54.229 --> 03:02:55.364
IN A POSITION TO ACTUALLY

03:02:55.431 --> 03:02:57.700
SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY BECAUSE

03:02:58.233 --> 03:02:59.068
FIRST OF ALL IT'S A VERY

03:02:59.134 --> 03:03:00.803
HIGH BAR TO BE CATEGORIZED

03:03:00.869 --> 03:03:02.638
AS WITH THE FELONY VERY

03:03:02.705 --> 03:03:04.173
HIGH BAR NINE HUNDRED FIFTY

03:03:04.239 --> 03:03:05.507
DOLLARS AN AGGREGATION OF

03:03:05.574 --> 03:03:07.343
HAVE A PROBLEM WITH BUT

03:03:08.177 --> 03:03:09.978
I DO IT WE TALKED ABOUT BALANCE

03:03:10.045 --> 03:03:12.381
AND I DO BELIEVE THE DIVERSION

03:03:12.448 --> 03:03:14.583
IS A VERY EFFECTIVE PATHWAY

03:03:14.650 --> 03:03:16.919
FOR MISDEMEANOR OFFENSES --

03:03:16.985 --> 03:03:18.854
BECAUSE IT IT DOES ADDRESS

03:03:19.655 --> 03:03:21.990
A REFORM ATTITUDE AND GIVES

03:03:22.057 --> 03:03:24.727
INCENTIVES AND REASONS TO BECOME

03:03:24.793 --> 03:03:26.261
A MORE COMPLIANT PERSON BUT I I

03:03:26.328 --> 03:03:27.529
DO BELIEVE THERE'S AN IMBALANCE

03:03:27.596 --> 03:03:29.198
OF JUSTICE WHEN THE CONVENTION

03:03:29.264 --> 03:03:30.766
WHEN A CONVICTION IS COMPLETELY

03:03:30.833 --> 03:03:33.202
DISMISSED AND THAT'S WHAT THIS

03:03:33.268 --> 03:03:36.071
BILL AS I UNDERSTAND IT WILL --

03:03:36.438 --> 03:03:38.574
WILL AFFORD THE OFFENDER AND

03:03:38.640 --> 03:03:40.709
NOT ONLY CAN ARE THEY ELIGIBLE

03:03:40.776 --> 03:03:42.511
FOR THIS -- THIS DIVERSION

03:03:42.578 --> 03:03:44.146
BUT THIRD OF ELIGIBLE FOR

03:03:44.213 --> 03:03:45.714
THIS DIVERSION ONCE A YEAR

03:03:46.515 --> 03:03:47.816
I THINK THAT THAT'S WAY TOO

03:03:47.883 --> 03:03:49.284
GENEROUS AND I I THINK THAT THAT

03:03:49.351 --> 03:03:51.353
AVOIDS THE BALANCE OF JUSTICE

03:03:51.787 --> 03:03:53.355
SO THERE THAT'S WHY I CAN'T

03:03:53.422 --> 03:03:56.191

MOVE THE BALL FORWARD RIGHT

03:04:25.320 --> 03:04:27.890

03:35:25.712 --> 03:35:26.713
PRESUMPTION THAT WHEN A JUVENILE

03:35:26.780 --> 03:35:28.582
COURT TERM EDUCATION THAT MEANS

03:35:28.882 --> 03:35:30.050

EDUCATE TO THEM BY A JUVENILE

03:35:33.287 --> 03:35:34.921

RECORD LESS THAT DISMISSAL I

03:35:38.025 --> 03:35:39.192
WOULD ENDANGER PUBLIC SAFETY

03:35:39.259 --> 03:35:40.961
FROM THE SAY THAT AGAIN THE THE

03:35:41.028 --> 03:35:42.562
JUDGE HAS DISCRETION IN A LESS

03:35:42.629 --> 03:35:44.998
THAT AND UNLESS THAT WE TAKE

03:35:45.065 --> 03:35:45.899

CLEARSIDE PODESTA FOLKS NOW I'M

03:35:47.968 --> 03:35:49.269

03:35:49.336 --> 03:35:50.437
SOMEONE MAKE SURE OF THE CLEAR

03:35:51.705 --> 03:35:54.141
I APOLOGIZE -- IT UNLESS THAT

03:35:54.207 --> 03:35:55.342
UNLESS THAT DISMISSAL WOULD

03:35:55.409 --> 03:35:56.910
ENDANGER PUBLIC SAFETY OR THERE

03:35:56.977 --> 03:35:58.345
ARE SOME WHO ARE NOW SAY THAT

03:35:58.412 --> 03:35:59.813
ONE MORE TIME BECAUSE OFTEN

03:35:59.880 --> 03:36:00.847
TIMES PEOPLE SAY WELL WHAT IF

03:36:00.914 --> 03:36:01.815
THIS PERSON GOES DOES THAT'S

03:36:01.882 --> 03:36:03.550
WHAT THIS PERSON BECOMES A

03:36:03.617 --> 03:36:05.852
THREAT UNLESS THAT DISMISSAL

03:36:06.219 --> 03:36:08.422
WOULD ENDANGER THE PUBLIC SAFETY

03:36:08.822 --> 03:36:10.390
THIRTY VERY CLEAR ABOUT THAT AND

03:36:10.457 --> 03:36:12.025
THERE ARE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN A

03:36:12.092 --> 03:36:14.728
JUVENILE ADJUDICATION -- AND

03:36:14.795 --> 03:36:16.930
A CONVICTION THAT HAPPENS --

03:36:16.997 --> 03:36:18.732
WHEN A PERSON IS AN ADULT THAT

03:36:18.799 --> 03:36:20.834
MEANS EIGHTEEN OR OVER BECAUSE A

03:36:20.901 --> 03:36:22.369
JUVENILE ADJUDICATION IS IS I'VE

03:36:22.436 --> 03:36:24.304
COME TO LEARN OVER THE YEARS --

03:36:24.371 --> 03:36:26.406
IT IS WHEN IT IS WHEN THEY DO

03:36:26.473 --> 03:36:28.175
IT ALL GOES BEFORE COURT THERE'S

03:36:28.241 --> 03:36:30.410
NO A JURY OF THEIR PEERS -- DID

03:36:30.477 --> 03:36:31.545
YOU KNOW SYSTEM IS SUPPOSED TO

03:36:31.611 --> 03:36:33.847
BE REHABILITATIVE BUT WHEN A

03:36:33.914 --> 03:36:35.515
JUVENILE GOES BEFORE A COURT THE

03:36:35.582 --> 03:36:38.051
COURT IN MY MIND IN MANY CASES

03:36:38.118 --> 03:36:39.286
DETERMINE THE JUVENILES DONE

03:36:39.353 --> 03:36:41.021
SOMETHING BECAUSE IT THE BURDEN

03:36:41.088 --> 03:36:43.090
RESPONSIBILITY IS TO DEVELOP

03:36:43.156 --> 03:36:45.592
THAT SAID -- THERE

03:36:45.659 --> 03:36:48.328
IS NO REHABILITATIVE PROCESS

03:36:48.762 --> 03:36:50.864
-- WHEN A PERSON IS INCARCERATED

03:36:52.165 --> 03:36:53.367
I WANT TO STATE THAT BECAUSE

03:36:53.834 --> 03:36:55.635
IT IS VERY DIFFERENT THAN IN

03:36:55.702 --> 03:36:58.238
ADULT COURT ADULT COURT -- IS

03:36:58.305 --> 03:36:59.940
IS IT WENT WHEN A PERSON GOES

03:37:00.006 --> 03:37:01.942
TO TRIAL IT IS BEFORE THE COURT

03:37:02.008 --> 03:37:04.111
IN IT IS DETERMINED BY IT BY A

03:37:04.177 --> 03:37:06.413
JURY OF THEIR PEERS SO AGENTS

03:37:06.480 --> 03:37:08.248
SO A PERSON HAS THE ABILITY TO

03:37:08.482 --> 03:37:09.649
PRESENT INFORMATION AND MAKE

03:37:09.716 --> 03:37:10.550
THE CASE TO A JURY OF THEIR

03:37:10.617 --> 03:37:12.119
PEERS NOW WE MAY HAVE A DETAILS

03:37:12.185 --> 03:37:14.221
OPTICAL DIFFERENCES ON HOW WE

03:37:14.287 --> 03:37:15.489
VIEW THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM

03:37:15.555 --> 03:37:17.290
BUT THOSE ARE FACTS WHAT WE

03:37:17.357 --> 03:37:18.425
WANT TO MAKE SURE IS THAT WHEN

03:37:18.492 --> 03:37:21.294
A INDIVIDUAL -- IN AND AND

03:37:21.361 --> 03:37:23.029
IS PRODUCTIVE AND I'M A STATE

03:37:23.096 --> 03:37:24.364
AGAIN IS NO LONGER A DANGER

03:37:24.431 --> 03:37:26.133
TO PUBLIC SAFETY THE DATA JUDY

03:37:26.199 --> 03:37:28.368
CATION COULD BE -- COULD BE

03:37:28.435 --> 03:37:30.203
REMOVED AND AND THAT GOES A LONG

03:37:30.270 --> 03:37:32.672
WAYS -- IT ALLOWS A PERSON TO

03:37:32.739 --> 03:37:34.007
POTENTIALLY LIST IN THE ARMY

03:37:34.241 --> 03:37:36.710

03:37:36.777 --> 03:37:39.179
GAIN -- AND EMPLOYMENT -- OUT

03:37:39.246 --> 03:37:40.213
OF STATE OR FACILITIES THAT

03:37:40.280 --> 03:37:41.248
REQUIRE A FEDERAL BACKGROUND

03:37:41.314 --> 03:37:42.983
CHECKS OR SECURE OPC --

03:37:43.049 --> 03:37:45.519

APPLIES TO CALIFORNIA SO IF

UP -- BUT I WE THINK THIS IS

03:37:58.799 --> 03:38:00.634
INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE

03:38:00.700 --> 03:38:02.636
ABILITY TO CLEAN ONE'S RECORDS

03:38:02.702 --> 03:38:03.737
IF THEY A PRODUCTIVE MEMBER

03:38:09.576 --> 03:38:11.912
FULFILLED AND IN HAVING THAT THE

03:38:11.978 --> 03:38:14.381

I WANTED I WANT TO SAY THAT IF

03:38:22.689 --> 03:38:24.191
IT IF THE JUDGE HAS DISCRETION

03:38:24.257 --> 03:38:25.325
