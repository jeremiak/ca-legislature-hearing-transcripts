01:10:36.498 --> 01:10:37.666

HEARD FROM OUR MAY BE HEARING

01:10:39.535 --> 01:10:41.403
FROM HERE MOMENTARILY. WE'D

01:10:41.470 --> 01:10:42.471
LIKE TO ARGUE THAT SOME OF THAT

01:10:42.538 --> 01:10:44.607
OPPOSITION IS ACTUALLY SHOWING

01:10:44.673 --> 01:10:46.542
THAT THEY SUPPORT THE PROGRAM

01:10:46.609 --> 01:10:48.277

UP RB AT VARIOUS IN VEHICLE

TECHNOLOGIES. HOWEVER THEY'RE

01:10:53.482 --> 01:10:54.817
BRINGING BAGGAGE TO THIS

01:10:54.883 --> 01:10:56.385
CONVERSATION LIKE WE ALL DO

01:10:56.452 --> 01:10:57.686
BASED ON THE BEHAVIOR OF THE

01:10:57.753 --> 01:10:59.622
PAST ACTIVITIES OR RECENTLY F

01:10:59.688 --> 01:11:01.857
THE AGENCY. AND WE THINK IT'S

01:11:01.924 --> 01:11:03.759
FAIR THAT OBVIOUSLY THEY WOULD

01:11:03.826 --> 01:11:04.727
ENTER THIS CONVERSATION

01:11:04.793 --> 01:11:06.762
THINKING ABOUT THE WAY IN WHICH

01:11:06.829 --> 01:11:08.130
THE ENERGY COMMISSION HAS BEEN

01:11:08.197 --> 01:11:10.065
WORKING ON THE PROGRAM SO FAR.

01:11:10.132 --> 01:11:11.800
HOWEVER WE BELIEVE THEY'VE GONE

01:11:11.867 --> 01:11:13.869
TOO FAR IN THEIR ASK THAT THE

01:11:13.936 --> 01:11:15.571
EXTREME CLARITY THEY'RE LOOKING

01:11:15.638 --> 01:11:17.106
FOR IN THIS LEGISLATION IS AN

01:11:17.172 --> 01:11:18.774
APPROPRIATE FOR THE LEGISLATURE

01:11:18.841 --> 01:11:21.010
TO PUSH FOR ANNABEL. AND

01:11:21.076 --> 01:11:22.344
EXTREME CLARITY LEAST IN OUR

01:11:22.411 --> 01:11:23.345
UNDERSTANDING IS TRYING TO GET

01:11:23.412 --> 01:11:24.980
DOLLAR AMOUNTS OR PERCENTAGES

01:11:25.047 --> 01:11:27.116
INTO THE BILL. THERE'S THREE

01:11:27.182 --> 01:11:28.817
CRITICAL REASONS WE WOULD ARGUE

01:11:28.884 --> 01:11:31.220
THAT THAT'S A PROBLEM. ONE IT

01:11:31.286 --> 01:11:32.655
OPENS UP THE DOOR FOR ANY OTHER

01:11:32.721 --> 01:11:34.223
TECHNOLOGY TO TRY TO COME IN

01:11:34.289 --> 01:11:36.925
AND GET ITS CARVE OUT ITS

01:11:36.992 --> 01:11:38.227
SPECIAL PIECE OR ITS PERCENTAGE.

01:11:38.293 --> 01:11:39.962
TO ENFORCE IS THE LEGISLATURE

01:11:40.029 --> 01:11:42.297
TO PRIDE TRY TO PICK WINNERS. I

01:11:42.364 --> 01:11:43.465
WILL REMIND YOU WHEN THIS

01:11:43.532 --> 01:11:44.733
PROGRAM WAS ORIGINALLY

01:11:44.800 --> 01:11:46.602
AUTHORIZED EVERYBODY THOUGHT

01:11:46.669 --> 01:11:47.803
EVERY SINGLE DOLLARS SHOULD BE

01:11:47.870 --> 01:11:50.272
SPENT. ON CELLULOSIC ETHANOL

01:11:50.339 --> 01:11:52.007
AND THAT WASN'T THE CASE. AND

01:11:52.074 --> 01:11:53.876
IT WAS GOOD THAT THE

01:11:53.942 --> 01:11:54.410
LEGISLATURE DID NOT PICK A

01:11:54.476 --> 01:11:56.745
WINNER. THIRD I THINK PEOPLE

01:11:56.812 --> 01:11:58.647
HAVE NOT ACTUALLY READ THE BILL

01:11:58.714 --> 01:12:00.516

TECHNOLOGY NEUTRALITY. BUT

01:26:18.172 --> 01:26:20.775
BECAUSE THIS PROGRAM IS THE

CREATING THE SAME PARTY

01:27:11.092 --> 01:27:12.026
LANGUAGE I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE

01:27:12.093 --> 01:27:13.428
CONFUSION IS BECAUSE WE'D LIKE

01:27:13.494 --> 01:27:14.529

LANGUAGE FOR LIGHT DUTY AS WE

01:27:17.465 --> 01:27:20.568
THERE'S NO- YOU KNOW. FOCUSING

IS TECH NEUTRAL- WE'VE- STATED

01:27:26.007 --> 01:27:26.874
THAT VERY CLEARLY IN THE

01:27:26.941 --> 01:27:28.910
LANGUAGE- AND IT DOESN'T TOUCH

01:27:28.977 --> 01:27:30.812
THE EXISTING 20% CARVE OUT FOR

01:27:30.878 --> 01:27:32.180
HYDROGEN FUELING INFRASTRUCTURE

01:27:32.246 --> 01:27:35.083
