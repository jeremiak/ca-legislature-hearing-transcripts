THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR IN SENATORS SLAM TODAY I'M HERE. TO PRESENT SB THREE HUNDRED THE SENTENCING REFORM ACT OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. SENSING SOMEONE TO DIE IN PRISON WITH THE BY THE DEATH PENALTY OR BY LIFE WITHOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF PAROLE SO WHAT. IS VIRTUALLY UNHEARD OF. IN MUCH OF THE WORLD. CALIFORNIA NOT ONLY REGULARLY IMPOSES THE SENTENCES BUT REQUIRES JUDGES. TO IMPOSE THEM FOR CERTAIN CATEGORIES OF OFFENSES EVEN ON DEPENDENTS WHO DID NOT KILL NOR INTEND FOR PERSON TO BE KILLED. CURRENT CALIFORNIA LAW MANDATES A SENTENCE. OF DEATH WIFE THE POSSIBILITY OF PAROLE FOR ANYONE CONVICTED OF MURDER ESPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES. EVEN IF THE PERSON DID NOT KILL ANYONE NOR INTEND FOR ANYONE TO DIE UNDER CURRENT LAW. IF A PERSON DIES DURING THE COURSE OF CERTAIN FELONIES. EVEN IF THE DEATH IS ACCIDENTAL THOSE WERE INVOLVED IN THE PHONE OR SUBJECT TO BE SEVERE PUNISHMENTS REGARDLESS OF THE ROLE IN THE PERSON'S DEATH THROUGH THEIR INTENT. ADDITIONALLY FOR ALL CRIMES IN THE SENTENCING SCHEME. IF ANY SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES FOUND TRUE. THE JUDGE HAS NO CHOICE. BUT TO SENTENCE A PERSON TO DEATH WELL WHAT. CURRENT LAW FORBIDS THE JUDGE FROM CONSIDERING WHETHER THESE PUNISHMENTS ARE FAIR IN ANY GIVEN CASE. THE MANDATED MINIMUM IS TO DIE BEHIND PRISON WALLS. WITHOUT ANY MEANS OF EARNING PAROLE. THE SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES SENTENCING SCHEME REFLECTS THE WORST TENDENCIES WITHIN OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM IN OVERWHELMINGLY IMPACTS PEOPLE OF COLOR. FOR EXAMPLE MORE THAN TWO THIRDS OF PEOPLE SERVING A WALK CALIFORNIA. ARE BLACK OR BROWN IN THE VAST MAJORITY HAD NO PRIOR CRIMINAL RECORD BEFORE BEING SENTENCED TO DIE IN PRISON. MOST WERE UNDER TWENTY FIVE YEARS OF AGE AT THE TIME OF THE OFFENCE. IN THE AVERAGE AGE OF THOSE SUCH SENTENCED IS NINETEEN YEARS OLD CURRENTLY. DECADES OF RESEARCH HAS FAILED TO SHOW ANY PUBLIC SAFETY BENNETT BENEFIT. M. L. WHAT FOR THE DEATH PENALTY ON THE CONTRARY SEVERE PUNISHMENTS LIKE THESE HAVE DRIVEN THE MASS INCARCERATION CRISIS THAT IS DESTROYING LIVES FAMILIES AND ENTIRE COMMUNITIES PARTICULARLY BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE LONG BEEN DEPRIVED OF SUPPORT OF INVESTMENTS AND PROGRAMS WERE BEING TARGETED. BY POLICING RACISM AND OPPRESSION. SB THREE HUNDRED WOULD SEEK TO FIX THIS OVERSIGHT IN OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM BY PREVENTING SOMEONE. WHO IS NOT THE ACTUAL KILLER. IT DOESN'T HAVE AN INTENT TO KILL FROM BEING PUNISHED IN THIS WAY. BY DEATH OR LIFE WITHOUT PAROLE. ADDITIONALLY SB THREE HUNDRED CREATE A PROCEDURE FOR THOSE PREVIOUSLY CONVICTED UNDER THE SENSING SCHEME. TO PETITION THE COURT FOR RESENTENCING. MY WITNESSES HERE TODAY OUR SYSTEM IMPACTED INDIVIDUALS WITH DEEPLY COMPELLING STORIES- HERE TO TESTIFY IS TO ENSURE THE FOUNDER OF THE FELONY MURDER ELIMINATION PROJECT.

THERE IS NOBODY ELSE CURATORS TYPE THANK YOU BUT THEMSELVES OUT OR WERE MOVING NOW TO OPPOSITION WE HAVE ONE PRIMARY WITNESS IN OPPOSITION TO IT SB THREE HUNDRED IT'S JOHN BROUGH ARE- YOU PREPARED FOR HIS TESTIMONY AT THIS POINT. GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS JOHN PRO HARD I'M AN ASSISTANT DISTRICT ATTORNEY IN ALAMEDA COUNTY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION WE URGE A NO VOTE ON SB THREE HUNDRED. THIS BILL ELIMINATES SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES FOR FELONY MURDER UNLESS THE PROSECUTION CAN PROVE THAT THE DEFENDANT WAS THE ACTUAL KILLER. OR ACTED WITH THE EXPRESS INTENT TO KILL. IT BEARS REMINDING OF THE TYPES OF CASES WHERE DEFENDANTS ARE SUBJECT TO FELONY MURDER SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCE FINDING EVEN WHERE THE PROSECUTION IS UNABLE TO PROVE WHETHER THE DEFENDANT WAS THE ACTUAL KILLER. OR ACTED WITH INTENT TO KILL. THESE CASES OFTEN ARISE WERE VICTIMS ARE SEXUALLY ASSAULTED BY MULTIPLE PERPETRATORS. CONSIDER A CASE FOR TWO DEFENDANTS KIDNAPPED AND BRUTALLY SEXUALLY ASSAULT THE VICTIM. ONE PERPETRATOR THEN KILLS THE VICTIM. THE PROSECUTION IS OFTEN IN THE POSITION OF BEING UNABLE TO PROVE WHICH DEFENDANT WAS THE ACTUAL KILLER. OR THAT THE NON KILLER HAD EXPRESSED INTENT TO KILL. THAT IS ONE REASON WHY THE VOTERS ENACTED PROPOSITION ONE FIFTEEN. TO ENSURE THAT MAJOR PARTICIPANTS IN VIOLENT FELONIES. ACTING WITH RECKLESS INDIFFERENCE TO HUMAN LIFE. COULD BE APPROPRIATELY PUNISHED FOR SUCH A VICIOUS MURDERS. THE RETROACTIVE PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL ARE TOO BROAD. IF HE PREVIOUSLY SENTENCED DEFENDANT CONVINCES A JUDGE TO DISMISS THE FELONY MURDER SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES. THAT SAME DEFENDANT WILL BE ENTITLED TO RESENTENCING ON ALL OTHER CHARGES. AT A MINIMUM THIS BILL SHOULD LIMIT RELIEF TO THE FELONY MURDER SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCE AT ISSUE. IT SHOULD PROVIDE THAT NO OTHER CRIMES SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES OR ENHANCEMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO BE SENTENCING. THIS BILL ALSO GOES TOO FAR. IT ALLOWS A JUDGE TO DISMISS ANY SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCE FUNDING NOT JUST ONE BASED UPON FELONY MURDER. THE AUTHORED KNOWLEDGES THAT THIS PROVISION IS INTENDED TO FACILITATE REQUESTS BY A DISTRICT ATTORNEY TO RECOMMEND RESENTENCING ON SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCE MURDERS PURSUANT TO PENAL CODE SECTION ELEVEN SEVENTY SUBSECTION D. THE VOTERS ALREADY SPOKE LOUDLY ON THIS ISSUE WITH THE PASSAGE OF PROPOSITION ONE FIFTEEN. WHEN THEY SAID THAT SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCE FINDINGS MAY NOT BE DISMISSED. AND THEY DECLARED QUOTE THE RIGHTS OF CRIME VICTIMS ARE TOO OFTEN IGNORED BY OUR COURTS EMPIRE STATE LEGISLATURE UNQUOTE. FOR THE MOST SERIOUS CRIME IN OUR STATE THAT IS FIRST DEGREE MURDER UNDER SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES. CRIME VICTIMS END OF VOTERS DESERVE A SYSTEM WERE FINE NOW THE OF JUDGMENTS ARE RESPECTED. AND NOT SUBJECT TO SECOND GUESSING DECADES LATER. WE OPPOSED PASSAGE OF THIS BILL AS WRITTEN THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU NOW WILL GO TO WITNESSES WANTING TO TESTIFY HERE AND ROOM FORTY TWO ALL THREE. I DON'T SEE A HERD OF FOLKS GOING TO THE MICROPHONE SO THERE'S NO ONE HERE LET'S GO TO OUR OVERFLOW ROOM TWENTY FORTY. I DON'T SEE ANYONE THERE EITHER MISTER MODERATOR CAN WE GOT OUR PHONE LINES INTO IF THERE'S ANYONE QUEUED UP IN OPPOSITION TO SB THREE HUNDRED. PINE FORTY PLEASE GO AHEAD. OKAY THERE'S ONE QUEUED UP ONE MOMENT PLEASE W. WITH US ONE MOMENT. ONE EIGHTY EIGHT PLEASE GO AHEAD. THE CALIFORNIA POLICE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION OPPOSED TO THE BILL AND PRINT THANKS. FOR ANYBODY ELSE IF YOU LIKE TO CURE PLEASE PRESS ONE FOLLOWED BY ZERO AT THIS TIME. PLEASE PRESS ONE FOLLOWED BY ZERO. MISTER CARELESS NO OTHER PARTICIPANTS QUEUING UP. THANK YOU WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS AS IT RELATES TO THAT SPEED THREE HUNDRED SENATOR WEAH. THE BILL HAS BEEN MOVED TO SENATORS SCANNER. THANK YOU CHAIR I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS BILL- CALIFORNIA IS A VERY INTERESTING STATE WHEN YOU LOOK AT OUR TRENDS IN INCARCERATION RATES IN OUR TRENDS IN THE LIFE SENTENCES THE SIGNING OF LIFE SENTENCES. JUST UNDER FORTY PERCENT. OF THE TOTAL NUMBER OF INCARCERATED PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA ARE SERVING SOME FORM OF A LIFE SENTENCE FORTY PERCENT. NOW IF YOU COMPARE THAT FOR EXAMPLE TO ARKANSAS AND MISSISSIPPI. ONLY 15% OF THEIR PRISON POPULATION HAS LICENSES AND IF YOU THINK WELL MAYBE THAT'S BECAUSE MORE OF THEM HAVE BEEN GIVEN A DEATH SENTENCE NO CALIFORNIA EXCEEDS BOTH OF THOSE STATES IN TERMS OF. THE- PROVIDING OF A DEATH SENTENCE SO. JUST FROM A PROPORTIONALITY WE HAVE FAR MORE PEOPLE. WHO WE SENTENCED FOR LIFE. NOW OR THE CRIME RATES IN TERMS OF THE MOST HEINOUS CRIMES WORST IN OUR STATE THAN THOSE STATES NO. SO WHY IS IT THAT WE HAVE SO MANY MORE PEOPLE SERVING LIFE. BECAUSE OF EXTREME SENTENCING THAT NOT ONLY THE LEGISLATURE BUT ALSO VOTERS ENACTED. DURING BUT YOU KNOW YOU CAN HAVE A HIGH PROFILE CRIME WHICH IS REALLY AWFUL. AND IT'S PUBLICIZED AGREED DEAL SOMEONE SEIZES UPON THAT DOESN'T INITIATIVE AND THEN WE VOTERS PASS WITHOUT REALIZING THE IMPLICATIONS. AND THE BROAD SWATH OF THE POPULATION THAT WE ARE THEN AFFECTING BY SUCH A SENTENCE. NOW FREE FACTORED JUVENILES CALIFORNIA'S MADE SOME REFORMS FOR CALIFORNIA HAD BY FAR THE HIGHEST NUMBER BOTH RON NUMBER AND PERCENT OF JUVENILES THAT WERE GIVEN A LIFE SENTENCE EXCEEDING LOUISIANA TEXAS AND GEORGIA. NOW IN THIS THERE ARE APPROPRIATE TIMES FOR A LIFE SENTENCE BUT I THINK THAT THIS REFORM IS VERY REASONABLE AND I'M IT DOESN'T SURPRISE ME FOR EXAMPLE THAT THE DA'S SUPPOSE HOWEVER. WHAT BENEFIT HAS IT HAD TO CALIFORNIA TO HAVE THAT PERCENT OF PEOPLE 40% OF OUR INCARCERATED POPULATION SERVE A LIFE SENTENCE IT'S EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE FOR US EXTREMELY. AND VERY LITTLE BENEFIT AND AGAIN IT IS APPROPRIATE IN THE MOST HEINOUS CRIMES AND FOR PEOPLE WITH INTENT TO COMMIT MURDER POTENTIALLY TO SERVE A LIFE SENTENCE HOWEVER WITH THE BILL BEFORE US DOES IS ALLOW THERE TO BE A DISTINCTION. THAT YOU MAY STILL GET A VERY LONG SENSE BUT THAT YOU WOULD NOT BE GIVEN LIFE UNLESS YOU MET CERTAIN. CRITERIA NOW. AGAIN WHY THE DAS FEEL THAT THEY NEED TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO GIVE A LIFE WITHOUT PAROLE FOR. THE PEOPLE WHO I MEAN THERE'S FIRST DEGREE MURDER CASES THAT GET LESS OF A SENTENCE THEN THIS THEN THE CORRECTION THAT THE SENATORS PROPOSED TO US- THIS BILL IS GOING TO BE HARD BECAUSE IT'S A TWO THIRDS VOTE BECAUSE IT WAS DONE BY AN INITIATIVE IN WHICH REQUIRES TWO THIRDS BECAUSE FOR US TO FIX. SOMETHING THAT WAS PASSED BY INITIATIVE REQUIRES TWO THIRDS BUT I HOPE THAT WERE AT THE PLACE WHERE WE CAN APPRECIATE. THAT LICENSES WHILE THEY SERVE A PURPOSE AND ARE APPROPRIATE OR NOT APPROPRIATE. ACTUALLY 440% OF OUR OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE IN PRISON IN CALIFORNIA. SO I APPRECIATE YOUR- BRINGING THE BILL. AND I HOPE THAT WE ARE ABLE I HOPE MY COLLEAGUES ARE ABLE TO. SEE THE WISDOM OF MAKING THIS CORRECTION THIS DOES NOT ELIMINATE LIFE SENTENCES. AND CERTAINLY THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO MIGHT FEEL THAT THEY COULD BENEFIT FROM THIS BUT WHO WON'T BECAUSE IT IS NARROWLY CRAFTED. BUT AGAIN I APPRECIATE YOUR BRINGING FORWARD. THANK YOU ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. SENATOR SENATOR OF AYE SURE OTRO BOOK. DO YOU HAVE A QUESTION AB WITH REGARDS AND I'M NOT SURE IF- SENATOR CORTESE CAN ANSWER THIS OR PERHAPS- WITH THE CHAIRS PERMISSION- SENATOR SKINNER BUT WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO THE PUBLIC WHO VOTED FOR THIS INITIATIVE- AND NOW WE ARE GOING TO BE VOTING ON THE POSSIBILITY OF OVERTURNING THEIR REQUEST THEIR DESIRE OF WHAT THEY VOTED. HOW DO YOU. HOW DO YOU ANSWER TO THE TO THE BORDERS OF CALIFORNIA. FIVE I THINK THE WAY WE ANSWERED TO THE VOTERS OF CALIFORNIA IS- PRECISELY. HOW CENTER SKINNER JUST EXPLAIN THIS TO THE SITUATION THAT WE'RE IN- THAT THE VOTERS. WITH GOOD INTENTION- PASSES REFERENDUM- WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT THE OUTCOMES WOULD BE- WOULD NOT WOULD NOT KNOW WHAT THE EVOLUTION WOULD BE OF THE LEGISLATURE'S OWN EFFORTS TO REFORM THE JUSTICE SYSTEM A TO THIS POINT- AND- THE TWO THIRDS REQUIREMENT OF THIS LEGISLATURE WAS PUT IN AS A SAFEGUARD- TO ANY CHANGES THAT WOULD BE MADE TO THE REFERENDUM- AND I TO. OF COURSE IMPRESSING ON THAT THIS IS ENOUGH OF A PROBLEM- THAT THE TWO THIRDS A REQUIREMENT SHOULD. BE MET IN THIS LEGISLATURE IF IT'S NOT- THEN THE ANSWER TO THE VOTERS IS GOING TO BE- WE CAN'T WE CAN'T CHANGE WHAT YOU ENACTED INTO LAW BY REFERENDUM- IT THIS DOES NOT TAKE AWAY SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES- I THINK A LITTLE BIT OF THE OPPOSITION TESTIMONY MAY HAVE BEEN MISLEADING FOR EXAMPLE THE EXAMPLE THAT I HEARD IF I WAS HEARING IT RIGHT OF SEXUAL ASSAULT. WHICH INSTRUCTION TO THE BILL IS CLEARLY CALLED OUT OF SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES AND NOT ONLY CALLED ON THE SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES BUT WOULD STILL REQUIRE LOCK. OR THE DEATH PENALTY SIMPLY BY THE ASSERTION OF THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY. IN IN THE IN THE PROSECUTION SO. MUCH OF WHAT THE VOTERS ENACTED HIS STANCE SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES STANDS- BUT I DO BELIEVE IF WE WENT BACK TO THE VOTERS TODAY AND ASKED THE FLIP QUESTION- WOULD WAS IT YOUR EXPECTATION. THAT THE OUTCOMES THAT WE'VE GOTTEN FROM THIS BILL WOULD BE AS THEY ARE THE TWO THIRDS OF THOSE. CONVICTED UNDER SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES I'LL WALK OR DEATH PENALTY TWO THIRDS OF THOSE WILL DIE IN PRISON ONE WAY OR THE OTHER WHO WILL NOT COME OUT OF PRISON OTHER THAN IN A CASKET. TWO THIRDS OF THOSE WILL BE PEOPLE OF COLOR. TWO THIRDS OF THOSE WILL BE UNDER THE AGE OF TWENTY FIVE THE AVERAGE AGE WILL BE NINETEEN- WE HAVE TO STEP IN IN DISMANTLE. WHATEVER IT IS THAT THAT IS CREATING THOSE OUTCOMES I DO NOT BELIEVE IT WAS INTO THE VOTERS TO CREATE THOSE OUTCOMES. OTHERWISE THE REFERENDUM WOULD HAVE BEEN. UNCONSTITUTIONAL IN ALL LIKELIHOOD CERTAINLY RACIST- ON ITS FACE BUT NOW WE KNOW OF WHAT THE ACTUAL OUTCOMES OF THIS LAW OR WE HAVE THE WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO LOOK AT ACTUAL OUTCOMES ACTUAL DATA- YEAH WE HAVE A PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCE RIGHT NOW AND I THINK IT'S PROBABLY. THE MOST COMPELLING- THE MOST COMPELLING REASON TO CORRECT. A WHAT I THINK SENATOR SKINNER'S ALLUDING TO A POINTING OUT. HIS SOMETHING THAT ABSOLUTELY NEEDS TO BE CORRECTED BECAUSE OF HER FINE WORK ON SB FOURTEEN THIRTY SEVEN- WE WE'VE ALREADY IT IN ESSENCE CORRECTED A FLAW IN THE FELONY MURDER. DR IN CALIFORNIA BUT WE HAVEN'T CORRECTED THE SAME FOR IN SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES. SO WE HAVE A PECULIAR SCENARIO. PERSONS WHO WERE NOT SENTENCED TO L. WALKER DEF- ARE ABLE TO PETITION COURTS FOR RELIEF BY SHOWING THAT THEY NEVER INTENDED TO KILL IN THE MET THE QUALIFICATIONS FOR RESENTENCING- BUT UNDER UNDER FELONY MURDER BUT UNDER SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES- THAT THAT REMEDY DOES NOT EXIST. SO HI THIS BILL WOULD WOULD WOULD BRING ALL THAT INTO ALIGNMENT- WITH THAT- MISTER CHAIRMAN I'M- AVAILABLE TO RESPOND TO ANY FAULT QUESTIONS OR IF- IF SENATOR- CHOI BOGUE- WOULD LIKE ADDITIONAL FOLLOW UP TO THAT. I WOULD DEFER TO NATASHA MINSKER WHO I INDICATED AT THE OUTSET IS AVAILABLE TO ANSWER. BUT LEGAL TECHNICAL QUESTIONS. I JUST HAVE ONE FOLLOW UP QUESTION ON ON. UNDER THE OPPOSITION'S WITNESSES- COMMENT WITH REGARD TO THIS BILL IS FOUND TO BE VERY BROAD AND NOT NEARLY ENOUGH TO- I'M% ASSUMING MEET THE INTENT OF YOUR OF YOUR INTENT OF YOUR BILL- HOW DO YOU RESPOND TO THAT. I HEARD THE OPPOSITION WITNESS- USING THE TERM BROAD WITH RIGHT REFERENCE TO THE RESENTENCING PETITION THAT'S CONTAINED IN THE BILL MMHM- WITH SOME CONCERN THAT- BUT FRANKLY I THOUGHT HIS. IS OPPOSITION STATEMENT WAS SO BROAD IT'S HARD TO TELL WHICH PART OF IT IS CONCERNED ABOUT TO BROAD IS YOU KNOW I SHOULD REALLY BE RESPONDING TO BE HONEST- BUT- BUT WE THINK IT'S AN APPROPRIATE. VETTED- OPPORTUNITY FOR PETITION FOR REDRESS- IN. BUT YOU KNOW THAT REDRESS WOULD STILL HAVE TO BE APPROVING UP IN A COURT OF LAW. THANK YOU. I JUST ONE LAST COMMENT- IT'S JUST REALLY SAD THAT IN OUR STATE. WE HAVE SO MANY CASES COMING IN FOURTH I MEAN THE NUMBERS ARE ALARMING- AND IT REALLY JUST MAKES ME THINK OF- WHERE WE ARE AS A CULTURE IN OUR STATE- AS A WHOLE- AND- IT COMING FROM A SMALL TOWN COMMUNITY CITY I JUST I'M VERY CONCERNED ABOUT. JUST THE BEHAVIOR HEALTH OF OUR STATE. D. THE CLIMATE THE CULTURAL CLIMATE THAT WE'RE LIVING IN I THINK IT'S WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. WE ARE DOING WHAT WE CAN TO SUPPORT- HEALTHY FAMILIES IN OUR COMMUNITIES- AND TO HELP CHANGE AND FOCUS ON QUALITY EDUCATION AS WELL TO BREAK BARRIERS. AND IN A CULTURE THAT IS. QUITE FRANKLY BROKEN BY THE MEANS OF THE STATISTICS THAT WERE PRESENTED TODAY- SPECIALLY BY SENATOR SKINNER. THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTERS CAN. THANK YOU TO YOUR APOLOGIES I WANTED TO JUST MAKE ONE OTHER COMMENT WE HAD A NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT CALLED IN WHO WE HAD SOME PEOPLE CALLED IN WHO INDICATED THEY HAD BEEN ABLE TO PETITION THE COURT AND BE RESENTENCED UNDER FOURTEEN THIRTY SEVEN WHICH IS A BILL I CARRIED THAT CORRECTED ARE FELONY MURDER LAW TO MAKE IT MORE TO CLARIFY THAT IN ORDER TO BE CHARGED WITH FELONY MURDER YOU HAD TO ACTUALLY HAVE A ROLE. IN THE DEATH OF THE PERSON- AND NOT BE JUST A BYSTANDER. NOW AS FAR THE SENATORS POINTED OUT WHO'S BROUGHT US THIS BILL THIS IS FIXING A PORTION OF. THAT FELONY MURDER LAW AROUND SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES NOW A NUMBER OF PEOPLE CALLED IN SO THE PEOPLE WHO CALLED IN AND SAID THEY HAD PETITIONED AND BENEFITTED FROM FOURTEEN THIRTY SEVEN. DID NOT FIVE WE'RE NOT A CONVICTED WITH THE SAME CIRCUMSTANCES AS WHAT SENATOR CORTESE SPRING BEFORE US. BUT WE ALSO HEARD IN THE WITNESSES WHO CALLED IN A NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO ARE NOW NO LONGER INCARCERATED BECAUSE THE GOVERNOR GAVE THEM A COMMUTATION TO A GOVERNOR LOOKED AND THOUGHT OUT OKAY THIS IS NOT APPROPRIATE THAT THEY HAD THIS LIFE SENTENCE. AND ANOTHER REASON THAT I WANTED TO- EXPRESS IN EFFECT THE SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL IS THAT WHILE I APPRECIATE AND THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR GOVERNORS TO HAVE SUCH A RULE I DON'T THINK A PERSON CIRCUMSTANCE SHOULD BE DEPENDENT SOLELY AND ONLY ON THE POWER OF A GOVERNOR TO COMMUTE. A SENTENCE ESPECIALLY WHEN WE HAVE 40% OF OUR PRISON POPULATION WAS ABOUT A HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE FOR SO 40% OF THAT IS- YOU DO THE MATH OF ABOUT FORTY THOUSAND PEOPLE SERVING LIFE SENTENCES THERE'S NO WAY ANY GOVERNOR CAN REVIEW THAT LEVEL OF POPULATION TO DETERMINE WHETHER. THEY WERE APPROPRIATELY SENTENCED SO WHAT THIS BILL DOES THIS DOES NOT GUARANTEE THAT PEOPLE WITH THIS SENTENCE WILL. HAPPY COURT FAVORABLY REVIEWED THEM IT JUST GIVES THEM THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABLE TO PETITION THE COURT. AND THE COURT THEN TO LOOK AT THE CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH ALLOWS THE DA'S TO COME FORWARD THE PROSECUTOR IT ALLOWS VICTIMS TO COME FORWARD IT ALLOWS EVERYONE TO COME FORWARD AND RE LOOK AT THE- CITY OUT. YOU KNOW WE DID THIS DID THE CRIME THE ROLE OF THAT PERSON IN THIS CRIME FIT THE PUNISHMENT THAT THEY RECEIVED RIGHT NOW THE COURT HAS NO CHOICE BECAUSE OF THE WORDING OF THE INITIATIVE IT IS ONLY ARE ENACTING THIS BILL THAT WOULD ALLOW BOTH GOING FORWARD AND PEOPLE WHO ARE CURRENTLY SERVING SUCH SENTENCES TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A REVIEW. OF WHETHER THAT SENTENCE WOULD BE APPROPRIATE TO OUR LANDS NOW SO I JUST WANTED TO MAKE THAT ADDITIONAL POINT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU YEAH SENATE SENATOR CALM WATER. I JUST WANTED TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD- AND WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE IS STILL A BURDEN OF PROOF THAT HAS TO BE MET THIS IS NOT OPENING THE FLOODGATES FOR FOLKS TO JUST. GET OUT BUT IT IS SORT OF. ASKING US TO RE THINK VERY LOW CRITERIA- THAT WE'VE PLACED- IN THE HANDS OF PROSECUTORS- FOR SO LONG- IN AIDING US IN KIND OF RETHINKING- YOU KNOW WHAT THRESHOLD SHOULD LOOK LIKE WHEN YOU'RE- INCARCERATING FOLKS. FOR LIFE- I WOULD ALSO ASK THEM HUMBLY SO IF- I COULD BE ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR WHEN THE TIME IS APPROPRIATE. THANK YOU YES SENATOR. BUT I WOULD BE HAPPY TO HAVE YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU HANFORD QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS. WELL SIR I DO WANNA THANK YOU FOR WAR I FIND TO BE A VERY COMMONSENSE MEASURE A MEASURE AS SENATOR SKINNER AND HAS CLEARLY STATED- IS NOT A GET OUT A GEO THE CARD IS JUST AN OPTION. IT'S AND I DON'T KNOW WHY WE ARE SO FEARFUL OF GIVING PEOPLE OPTIONS AND THE QUESTION WAS ASKED ADDS TO FIFTEEN TO BROAD WELL THAT'S THE CATCH PHRASE ON ANY REFORM THAT IS CALM BEFORE THIS LEGISLATIVE BODY SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE. ANY NIBBLING AROUND THE EDGES IS ALWAYS TOO BROAD FOR OUR D. A. SYSTEM NO MATTER WHAT IT IS BUT IF THIS WAS REALLY ABOUT JUSTICE. THE NEW NGUYEN BE JUST US ON LIFE WITHOUT PAROLE AND I MEAN JUST US I MEAN BLACK AND BROWN PEOPLE AND POOR THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE WHO ARE FACING THIS SENTENCE ARE POOR PEOPLE THERE'S NO WEALTHY PERSON IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHO'S ON DEATH ROW. LET'S BE CLEAR ABOUT THAT SO IT'S A POOR PEOPLE'S PUNISHMENT AND ALL THIS DOES IS GIVE A- COURT THE OPTION OF RESENTENCING REEVALUATING THAT CRIME WE'VE SEEN TOO MANY YOUNG PEOPLE THIS CALIFORNIAN AND IT IS THE ONLY STATE. ONE OF THE FEW STATES ARE THREE. N. FEW YOUR STATES ONE ONLY COUNTRY. THAT HOUSE L. Y. WE SEE PEOPLE FOR POLITE WHAT THE POSSIBILITY OF PRETTY. I WELL AS ARE MINORS. YOU GO TO THIRD WORLD COUNTRIES WHERE THEY DON'T SENTENCE KIDS AND PEOPLE TO DEATH R. OR FOR LIFE FOR PRESIDENT BUSH WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE SUCH A PROGRESSIVE LEADING STATE AND WE OFTEN SAY WITH THE NEXT COMING ATTRACTION I LIKE THAT COMMENT THE GOVERNOR STATES BUT- NOT WHEN IT COMES TO CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM. AND TO THE QUESTION OF OVERTURNING THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE I'VE DONE THIS LONG ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT THE MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA AND ACROSS THIS COUNTRY AND THIS IS NOT TO DISPARAGE OR BELITTLE THEM THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW TO PROPOSITIONS THERE ON THE BALLOT BECAUSE MOST OF US DON'T UNDERSTAND UNTIL THEIR PASSING SIR ALL WHILE. THIS IS UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE I DON'T UNDERSTAND. BECAUSE IF CRAP AND SET A WAY. THAT ARE SOLD MISLEADING TO VOTERS BACK. I GET MORE CALLS DURING ELECTION CYCLE OF WHAT PROPOSITION ABOUT FOR WHAT YOU CAN I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT CAN I GUARANTEE IF YOU PUT THE AVERAGE VOTER UNDER TRUTH SERUM FINISHED. THE MAJORITY OF THE STUFF THAT THEY'RE VOTING FOR. BECAUSE IT'S WRITTEN IN SUCH A WAY SO I DON'T THINK THE AVERAGE VOTER IT WAS CLEARLY EXPLAINED THAT SENATORS DEMONSTRATED WOULD ACT ALL- HAVE BOUGHT WHEN THEY VOTED FOR THIS A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO THAT IT WOULD LIMIT ONE'S ABILITY TO GET OUT OF JAIL AND SPEND THE REST OF YOUR LIFE WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT. FOLKS WHO WENT TO JAIL AS A NINETEEN YEAR OLDS AND YOU SPEND THE POSSIBILITIES OF YOUR LIFE WHEN YOU DIDN'T EVEN PULL THE TRIGGER SIMPLY BECAUSE YOU WERE IN THE CAR OR YOU WERE IN THE VICINITY AND YOU HAD NO INTENTIONS OF COMMITTING A CRIME WITHIN AWARE THAT A CRIME WAS GOING TO BE COMMENDED BUTTERICK THE WRONG PLACE AT THE WRONG TIME SO- I TOO WOULD LOVE TO BE ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR ON THIS MEASURE AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. AND WITHOUT. ANY FURTHER DO I WILL ALLOW YOU TO CLOSE. THE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- OF VERY HAPPY TO BRING YOU ON AS A- AS A- AUTHOR- I WANT TO THANK EVERYONE FOR THE SERIOUS DISCUSSION THIS MORNING IN A RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. BOTH. Q. CONSULTANT WE HAVE A MOTION BY SOONERS SKINNER IT'S A DO PASS RECOMMENDATION I'M I'M SORT BY CENTER WHEN I'M SORRY WE HAVE A MOTION IS TO PASS A REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS CONSULTANT PLEASE CALL THE ROLL ON S. B. UNDER. SB THREE HUNDRED BRADFORD REDFORD I INSURE. NO VOTE THE JOB OF NOT VOTING COM LAGER HI COMMA- I SKINNER. AYE SKINNER AYE WINNER. WHEN AYE THOSE FOUR ZERO FOUR ZERO THAT MEASURE PASSES THANK YOU SENATOR CORTESE'S WALL MOVING ON THEIR OWN TO SB THIRTY EIGHTY TWO I SEE CENTER CABALLERO. IS HERE. UPON THE PREPARATION OF POLL YOU YOU BEGIN ONCE WE'VE BEEN PROPER SENATE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I'M PLEASED TO PRESENT SB THREE EIGHTY TWO WHICH WOULD CLARIFY. THAT A RESTRAINING ORDER SHOULD BE ROUTINELY REQUESTED TO PROHIBIT A PREDATOR FROM CONTACTING BE EXPLOITED MINOR WHEN A SEXUAL PREDATOR IS TAKEN TO COURT AND CRIMINALLY CHARGED. I WANT TO START BY SAM HAPPY TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENT TO CHANGE DISTRICT ATTORNEY THE PROSECUTOR. ESTIMATES BY THE INTERNATIONAL LABOR ORGANIZATION REPORTED THERE ARE CLOSE TO TWENTY FIVE MILLION INDIVIDUALS BEING TRAFFICKED WORLDWIDE AND FOUR POINT EIGHT MILLION ARE VICTIMS OF SEXUAL EXPLOITATION AND IT'S ESTIMATED THAT OVER 99% OF THOSE VICTIMS ARE YOUNG WOMEN AND GIRLS. EXPERTS BELIEVE THE CALIFORNIA HAS THE HIGHEST INCIDENCE OF CHILD TRAFFICKING TRAFFICKING IN THE UNITED STATES STATE DUE TO OUR BUSY PORTS OF ENTRY HOWEVER IT'S HARD TO KNOW HOW MANY CHILDREN ARE VICTIMS DUE TO UNDER REPORTING. ADVOCATE INDICATE INDICATE THAT WHAT CRIMINAL CHARGES ARE BROUGHT AGAINST AN EXPLOITER AN OVERSIGHT OFTEN OCCURS THAT CAN HAVE DIRE CONSEQUENCES RESTRAINING ORDERS ARE NOT ROUTINELY REQUESTED WHICH DENIES THE TRAFFIC CHILD OR WOMAN. PROTECTION KEEPING CHILDREN AWAY FROM THEIR EXPLOITERS IS A LIFE AND DEATH MATTER AS THE AVERAGE AGE. AVERAGE LIFE EXPECTANCY OF AN EXPLOITED CHILD IS ONLY SEVEN YEARS. DUE TO THE HIGH INCIDENCE OF HOMICIDE DRUG OVERDOSE HIV AIDS SB TEAS AND SUICIDE. BEFORE THE PENAL CODE EXPLICITLY PERMITTED AND THERE FOR MOTIVATED PROSECUTORS AND JUDGES TO SEEK RESTRAINING ORDERS IN DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CASES THE LAW PERMITTED SUCH ORDERS TO ISSUE UNDER A GENERAL STATUTE PERMITTING CRIMINAL PROTECTIVE ORDERS. SUCH ORDERS IN DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CASES WERE RARE HOWEVER WHICH IS WHY THE LAW WAS AMENDED AND SPECIFICALLY THERE ARE NOW EIGHT EXPLICIT REFERENCES TO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDERS IN THE STATUTE AND THESE PROTECTIVE ORDERS ARE NOW ROUTINELY ISSUED WHICH SAVES LIVES. SB THREE EIGHTY TWO IS A SIMPLE CHANGE TO GIVE COMMERCIAL SEX SEXUAL EXPLOITATION VICTIMS THE RIGHT TO A PROTECTIVE ORDER AND CLARIFY THE CURRENT LAW PERMITS AND SET STANDARDS FOR THOSE ORDERS AS A PART OF A CRIMINAL PROSECUTIONS. GIVEN THE UNIQUE VULNERABILITY OF VICTIMS A MODEST CLARIFICATION OF CURRENT LAW IS LONG OVERDUE THANK YOU AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT IS MAGGIE KRAUSE. SENATOR MAKE CLARIFY SOMETHING QUICKLY. THE BILL IS ONE OF THE BILL WHICH WILL. CHAU OKAY PM ONE WITNESS IN SUPPORT TO DO ED HOURS WILL. YES.

DISPONIBILIDADE LAYERED WITH A TACTIC THAT TRAFFICKERS OFTEN EMPLOY MAKE IT EXCEPTIONALLY DIFFICULT FOR SURVIVORS TO BREAK FREE. EVEN AFTER THEIR TRAFFICKERS ARE ARRESTED. TRAFFICKERS USE. FORMS OF SOCIAL MEDIA FAMILY MEMBERS GETTING NETWORK INDIRECT COMMUNICATION TO CONTINUE THE CYCLE OF FEAR AND LOYALTY. EVEN WHEN. TRAVELERS ARE IN CUSTODY. IF SURVIVABLE BY JAM. MY LOOK TO CONSIDER AN ORDER THAT WOULD PROVE THE DEFENDANT FROM CON THE IT REMAINS THE COR THAT OTHER OUTLINED IN PENAL SECTION ONE THIRTY SIX POINT ZERO ARE ALSO AVAILABLE FOR CONSIDERATION IN CONTRACTING.

IS AVAILABLE NEW CASES. AND ACTUALLY SUMMARIZED ON PAGE FIVE OF THE ANALYSIS THE BILL ALSO PROVIDES IN ALL CASES OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING THE PROSECUTOR SHALL INQUIRE OF THE COURT WHETHER IT WILL ISSUE A RESTRAINING ORDER. THIS ENSURES THAT THE COURT CONSIDERED THE PICKING. THAT PROTECT THEM. REQUIRE THE COURT ISSUE ORDERS. IT DOESN'T EVEN THE FIVE TO ARGUE FOR THEIR ORDER.

NOBODY IS QUEUED UP AT THIS TIME THANK YOU NOW LET'S BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEES OR ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS AS IT RELATES TO. SB THREE EIGHT TWO. SENATOR CALM WATER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I. HAD A QUESTION REGARDING THE AMENDMENTS I HEARD. THE CONSULTANTS SAY THAT NO AMENDMENTS. FOR TAKEN AND THIS HEARING THAT'S BECAUSE THEY WERE TAKEN. BUT TO OKAY- AND THEN I'VE ALSO BEEN TOLD THAT. THOSE THAT WERE IN OPPOSITION BEFORE HAVE NOW COME OFTEN ARE NEUTRAL. DO WE KNOW OF THAT. SEVEN BUT IT SOUNDED LIKE IGN ASIO HERNANDEZ SAID FOR CA CJ ON THE PHONE. AND THEN- MY LAST QUESTION IS JUST- AS I WAS READING THROUGH THE BILL- AND THE ANALYSIS. I WAS WONDERING IF THERE IS ANY- CONSIDERATION THAT IS GIVEN BECAUSE I ALSO HEARD THAT IT'S NOT REQUIRED IT IS NOT MANDATORY BUT IT IS AN OPTION IT IS ANOTHER TOOL- THAT JUDGES HAVE AT THEIR DISPOSAL BUT I KNOW THAT IN MANY INSTANCES NOT IN ALL THOSE THAT ARE INVOLVED IN THIS KIND OF TRAFFICKING- ARE ALSO SORT OF VICTIMS ARE HAVE BEEN. VICTIMIZED BY THE SAME KIND OF BEHAVIOR AND CIRCUMSTANCES IN THE PAST- IT'S ALMOST ANALOGOUS TO CHILD SOLDIERS WHO ARE YOU KNOW PARTICIPATING IN CRIMINAL ACTIVITY AND- ARE CURRENTLY THEMSELVES BEING VICTIMIZED. SO I JUST DIDN'T KNOW- IF THERE'S ANY. REMEDY OF CONSIDERATION FOR SITUATIONS LIKE THE ACT OR IS IT SORT OF- INFERRED BY THE FACT THAT- THIS IS AN OPTION AT THE DISPOSAL RATHER THAN SOMETHING THAT IS- MANDATORY IF THAT MAKES SENSE. SO JUST A QUESTION- IS YOUR YOUR REFERENCE TO THAT THE ACCUSED OR TO THE VICTIM THE ACCUSED. I'M THIS THIS- THIS DOESN'T CHANGE THE RELATIONSHIPS- OR OR MAKE ANY- ASSUMPTION ABOUT THE ACCUSED- THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S THAT'LL BE PART OF I'M ASSUMING A CRIMINAL CASE WHERE- IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A DEFENSE BOB A POSSIBLE DEFENSE BOB YOU KNOW YEAH I WAS A VICTIM OF THIS ONCE AND SO THAT'S WHY I GOT INVOLVED IN IT- CERTAINLY THAT. I'VE I'VE NEVER HEARD THAT USE BUT I'M I'M I'M I'M ASSUMING THAT IT A CREATIVE- DEFENSE ATTORNEY COULD USE THAT WITH THIS HAS TO DO WITH IS THE CRIMINAL CASE AS IT COMES INTO COURT THE OF THE- ABILITY OF THE JUDGE TO UNDERSTAND THAT B. THAT THERE'S A PROCESS WHERE I THE JUDGE CAN ORDER A RESTRAINING ORDER PENDING THE OUTCOME OF THE CRIMINAL CASE. AND WHAT THAT DOES IS IT PROTECTS THE VICTIM. OR THE ALLEGED VICTIM IN THIS CASE- FROM BEING CONTACTED BY FROM BEING- APPROACHED OR IN ANY WAY INTIMIDATED BY. THE- THE PERPETRATOR AND BUT WHAT THE TESTIMONY AND THE INFORMATION THAT I RECEIVED FROM THE ADVOCATES IS THAT MANY TIMES- SEX TRAFFICKING IT INVOLVES. MORE THAN JUST THE INDIVIDUAL IT'S TRAFFICKING THAT THE VICTIM IT INVOLVES A WHOLE INFRASTRUCTURE IN PLACE WHERE THAT SEX SEX TRAFFICKER EVEN IF THEY'RE IN CUSTODY HAS THE ABILITY TO ASK PEOPLE TO CONTACT THE VICTIM- TO HAVE COMMUNICATION TO THREATEN THE VICTIM AND WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS TO MAKE SURE THAT. BECAUSE OF THE AGE OF THAT THEIR CHILDREN MANY OF THEM- THAT AND THEIR CHILDREN WHO BELIEVE THAT THEIR LOVED BY THE PERPETRATOR- THAT THAT WE HAVE AN INABILITY TO PROTECT THEM AND KEEP THEM. FROM HAVING CONTACT WITH SOMEONE WHO HAS ABUSED THEM SO THAT THEY CAN MOVE ONTO THEIR OWN RECOVERY SO THAT'S WHAT THAT'S THE THAT'S WHAT THIS IS THIS IS ABOUT IS- REMINDING THE COURT THAT THERE IS A TOOL IN THE TOOLBOX WHICH IS TO PROTECT THEM THE VICTIM IN THIS CASE AND IN A BUSY CRIMINAL COURT CALENDAR THIS IS EASY TO OVERLOOK YOU HAVE. YOU HAVE- THIS AWARENESS MUCH MORE IN A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CASE THEN YOU DO IN A CRIMINAL COURT. AND THE TEN YEARS IS THAT A COMMON LENGTH OF TIME HOW WAS THAT DECIDED YES THAT'S THAT'S THE LENGTH OF TIME THAT IT THAT'S IN THE STATUTE. IN OTHER WORDS WE'RE NOT CHANGING THAT. YOU ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS. BARTHAS COMMITTEE. HEARING NINE CENTER COPIER WHICH ALLOWED TO CLOSE THANK YOU MISTER MISTER CHAIR AND I. ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS. WE HAVE A TO PASS TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS WERE SEEKING A MOTION ON IT SB THREE EIGHT TWO ZERO MOTION. HELLO SIR MOVED SPIN MOVES BY SENATOR OF A CHOI BOLD. CONSULTANT PLEASE CALL THE ROLL ON SB THREE A TWO SB THREE EIGHTY TWO BRADFORD AYE BRADFORD AYE IT SHOWBOAT I JOBO GUY COM LONGER COME LONGER AYE SKINNER AYE SKINNER AYE WIENER. WHEN OUR EYES FIVE ZERO YOUR SENATOR CONGRATULATIONS VERY MUCH CONNECTION BOB I BELIEVE WE'RE GONNA TAKE SB. SEVEN FOUR EIGHT FIVE CENTER PORTANTINO. ONCE WE HAVE THE PODIUM STRICKEN FANS SO. WHEN YOU'RE READY SENATOR YOU MAY BEGIN THANK YOU THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I'M HERE TO PRESENT IS THE CHAIR SAID SB FIVE SEVEN FORTY EIGHT WHICH EXPANSIVE TYPE OF EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS COVERED BY PENAL CODE SIX TWO SIX TO INCLUDE CALIFORNIA'S PRIVATE NONPROFIT COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES. CURRENT LAW ONLY INCLUDES PUBLIC COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES AND PUBLIC AND PRIVATE K. TWELVE SCHOOLS INCLUSION OF PRIVATE NONPROFIT COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES IN PENAL CODE SIX TWO SIX WILL CREATE A CLEAR STANDARDS FOR THE ENFORCEMENT OF TRESPASSING AT PRIVATE NONPROFIT UNIVERSITIES THE BILL RECOGNIZES THAT THE NONPROFIT HIGHER EDUCATION SECTOR HAS SIMILAR RESPONSIBILITIES AND IT'S CONFRONTING SIMILAR PUBLIC SAFETY CHALLENGES AS THE PUBLIC- AS ITS PUBLIC COUNTERPARTS IT'S UNFORTUNATE. THAT WE HAVE TO WORRY SO MUCH ABOUT OUR INSTITUTIONS OF PUBLIC EDUCATION IN PUBLIC SAFETY MATTERS AS WE DO- TODAY AND SO THIS BILL SEEKS TO BRING EQUITY IT HAD IT WILL HELP CREATE SAFER COLLEGE CAMPUSES BY ENSURING THERE IS THE ABILITY TO ADEQUATELY ENFORCE TRESPASSING LAWS THE MAJORITY OF PRIVATE NONPROFIT COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES ARE RESIDENTIAL IN NATURE. AND HOW'S THE TRADITIONAL EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY FOUR YEAR OLD COLLEGE AGE GROUP AS WELL AS SOME GRADUATES AND FACULTY HOUSING THIS IS A MAJOR DIFFERENCE FROM TYPICAL PRIVATE BUSINESSES CURRENTLY PRIVATE NONPROFIT HIGHER EDUCATION TEST UTILITY YOUR LIFE THE SAME PEOPLE CODE SECTION THAT A PRIVATE BUSINESS USES NOT THAT OF THE PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES. THOUGH THEY PROVIDE A VERY DIFFERENT SERVICE THIS INCLUDES USE OF NO TRESPASSING LETTER SYNDICATE CONSENT AND HAS BEEN WITHDRAWN FROM AN INDIVIDUAL TO BE ON CAMPUS IN RECENT YEARS SOME DISTRICT ATTORNEYS OFFICES HAVE EXPRESSED RESERVATIONS ABOUT ISSUING TRESPASSING VIOLATIONS ON THE STRENGTH OF THESE LETTERS ENEA AB APPLICABILITY OF PENAL CODE SECTION SIX OH TWO THE PRIVATE NONPROFIT COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES. FURTHER TRESPASSING LETTERS MEANT TO SERVE A CONTINUING NOTICE. OF REVOCATION OF THE RIGHT TO OCCUPY PRIVATE PROPERTY HAVE BECOME IN IF IN CAMPUS COMMUNITIES DUE TO THE LACK OF CLEAR LEGAL GIDANCE ON ENFORCEMENT. THE LACK OF AN IMPORT EFFECTIVE ENFORCEMENT TOOL MEANS THAT INDIVIDUALS HAVE WHO HAVE BEEN ADVISED THAT PERMISSION TO USE THE CAMPUS HAS BEEN REVOKED SIMPLY RETURN TO CAMPUS. OFTEN ENGAGING IN THE SAME BEHAVIOR THAT CAUSED HER PERMISSION TO BE REVOKED UNTIL THEY ARE ASKED TO LEAVE AGAIN. THEY LEAVE ONLY TO RETURN AGAIN AND AGAIN REPEAT OFFENDERS LEARN THAT THEY ARE ABLE TO RETURN TO THESE CAMPUSES WITH LITTLE CONCERN. ABOUT CONSEQUENCES SB SEVEN FORTY EIGHT RECOGNIZES THAT PRIVATE COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO ENSURE THE PHYSICAL SAFETY OF THE CAMPUS COMMUNITY. AND THEY FACE SIMILAR PUBLIC SAFETY CHALLENGES AS THEIR PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION COUNTERPARTS. SB SEVEN FORTY EIGHT SIMPLY ASSESS PRIVATE NONPROFIT COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES BY EXPANDING PENAL CODESIX TWO SIX TO INCLUDE THEM AS WELL. AND THESE PROTECTIONS ARE ALREADY AFFORDED TO AS I SAID TO THE PUBLIC COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES AND PUBLIC PRIVATE. PUBLIC AND PRIVATE K. TWELVE SCHOOLS SO WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY ON BEHALF OF SOME FORTY EIGHT. IS RANDY BURBA CHIEF OF PUBLIC SAFETY AT CHAPMAN UNIVERSITY AND LAUREN SCHULTZ ALLER SENIOR ASSOCIATE BY PRO PRICE PROVOST INSTITUTION EQUITY IN ACCESS AT STANFORD UNIVERSITY AND OBVIOUSLY I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE WHEN APPROPRIATE. THANK YOU- SUMMARY PLEASE. QUEUE UP TO TWO PRIMARY WITNESSES THEY HAVE TWO MINUTES EACH THANK YOU. MY NAME IS RAINY BOURBON ACERS THE CHIEF OF PUBLIC SAFETY CHAPMAN UNIVERSITY ON BEHALF OF CHEN UNIVERSITY I SUPPORT THIS BILL AND HAVING BEEN A PAST PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA CALLED UNIVERSITY POLICE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION. AND REPRESENTING MANY COLLEAGUES I KNOW THERE IS BROAD SUPPORT FOR G. CENTER ACTORS AND TALKING WITH SOME OF MY COUNTERPARTS WHO WORKED IN THE PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS WHO ALREADY HAVE ACCESS TO THIS ADDITIONAL TOOL. IT IS EVIDENT THAT SIX POINT SIX MORE AFFECTED THAN SIX SO TOO BECAUSE IT ALLOWS FOR IMMEDIATE MITIGATION OF THREATENING SUSPICIOUS HAZARDOUS OR CRICKET ACTIVITIES ON CAMPUS AND WITH THE DIVINE GROUP AT LEAST SEVEN DAYS. ADDITIONALLY PROVIDES AN OPTION OF INTERNAL RESOLUTION WITHOUT REQUIRING AUTOMATIC PROCESSES SUCH AS PROSECUTION FOR TRADITIONAL SIX OH TWO INSTEAD ALLOWING CAMPUS RESOURCES AND PROCESSES TO BE ENACTED AND LEVERAGE TO RESOLVE THE EXISTING CONCERN. UNDERTAKEN NATIONAL MINISTRY OF ACTIONS TO SUPPORT EXTENDING THE STAY AWAY ORDER IS NECESSARY. THE BUILDING USED BOTTLE AND INTENTIONAL OPTIONS WITHIN SIX TWENTY SIX POINT FOR HER CAMPUS PERSONS AND. SIX TWENTY SIX POINT SIX FOR UNAFFILIATED PERSONS. ITOLD HER CAMPUS SAFETY. TO HELP. RIGHT OF CAMP OFFICIAL SUCH AS THE FAIR HUMAN. AND MANAGEMENT ALL MORE EFFECTIVELY. CHALLENGING IN PARTICULAR THE CHAMBER MOVED TO THIS IS IN BREAKING THE CYCLE REPEATED OF. IT'S MORE SO ST TIME AND MOST YOU'RE A- TYPICALLY IN THE MORNING. AND SUSTAINED. BY CERTAIN PERSONS. THEREBY REDUCING THE LIKELIHOOD OF REPEAT OFFENSES. THIS IS TRUE FOR STUDENT VERSUS DURING CONFRONTATIONS EMPLOYEE MISCONDUCT AND UNRELATED PERSONS WHO COME ON THE CAMPUS WITH THE INTENT TO ACT. UNLAWFULLY OR IN SOME. MANNER THERE ARE ALSO CASES WERE A THREAT MAY NOT RISE TO CRIMINAL LEVEL OR THE VICTIM IS NOT DESIROUS OF PROSECUTION. IN THESE CASES WITHOUT THE TOOLS PROVIDED SIX TWENTY SIX THERE WOULD BE NO RECOURSE TO MITIGATE POTENTIALLY ONGOING CONCERNING BEHAVIOR SHE- FINALLY IT'S PROVEN. PROVEN TOOL THAT ALREADY IS AVAILABLE PUBLIC GEN THREE TWELVE COMMUNITY COLLEGES CS USING UC'S. BECAUSE THIS TOOL CAN HELP PROTECT AND JEAN PAUL CONSTITUENTS INCLUDING MARGINALIZED MEANING THEY WERE SAFE. AS A MATTER EQUITY IT SHOULD BE AVAILABLE PRIVATE NONPROFIT INSTITUTIONS AS WELL. A STUDENT SHOULD NOT BE PENALIZED FOR WHERE THEY CHOSE TO ATTEND SCHOOL. THANK YOU FOR GIVING YOUR VALUABLE TIME. HERE MY SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL. THANK YOU WITNESS. GET MORE CARE BRADFORD COMMITTEE MAY NAY YOU FOR THIS. MY NAME LAWRENCE TALLER AND MISSING ASSOCIATE VICE PRO OF INSTITUTIONAL IT AND IT. I HER PRONOUNS I OVERSEE THE OFFICES THAT ADDRESS SEXUAL HARASSMENT IN ALL FORMS OF DISCRIMINATION ON OUR CAMPUS I AM SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF STANFORD IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL BECAUSE IT WOULD PROVIDE A MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE TOOLS TO PROTECT OUR CAMPUS FROM INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE ENGAGING AND DISTURBING BEHAVIORS CAUSING FEAR AND DESTRUCTION ON OUR CAMPUSES INCLUDING THOSE WHO ARE VIOLATING OUR HARASSMENT. AND DISCRIMINATION POLICIES I DO KNOW WE HAVE LEGAL OBLIGATIONS TO PROTECT OUR COMMUNITY FROM HARASSMENT AND DISCRIMINATION UNDER STATE AND FEDERAL LAWS EVEN WHEN THAT CONDUCT DOES NOT RISE TO THE LEVEL OF BEING A CRIME RIGHT NOW IT'S AN INDIVIDUAL BEING DISRUPTIVE ON OUR ON OUR CAMPUS PENAL CODE SECTION SECTION SIX OH TWO REQUIRES THAT WE FIRST INSTRUCTORS AND TO LEAVE AND IF THEY DO THE CLOCK RESETS ALLOWING THE INDIVIDUAL TO COME BACKAND CAUSE DESTRUCTION. DAY AFTER DAY OVER THE LAST YEAR SIMILAR TO WHAT WE ARE SEEING ACROSS MAJOR CITIES WE HAVE HAD INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE COME ONTO CAMPUS AND YELLED HATEFUL RACIAL EPITHETS AT STANFORD COMMUNITY MEMBERS WHO IDENTIFY AS API THIS LAW WOULD HELP US ADDRESS AND STOP THE TRAUMATIZING INCIDENCES. EIGHT THIS PAST YEAR WE HAD ST CODE RESTRICTIONS IN PLACE BUT NONETHELESS THE PERSON SHOWED UP WITHOUT A MASK AND LIKE TO APPROACH WOMEN AND HARASS THEM BY MAKING VIOLENT SEXUALLY AGGRESSIVE STATEMENT OUR STUDENTS WERE REALLY DISTRESSED THAT THE MOST WE CAN DO IS ASK HIM TO LEAVE EACH TIME WE SAW HIM THEY DID NOT UNDERSTAND WHY WHY WE COULD NOT DO MORE FOR THEM. THE RESTRAINING ORDER PROCESS REQUIRES THAT WE IDENTIFY A VICTIM BY NAME AFTER TO GO DOWN TO COURT AND TESTIFY AGAINST OF HARASSING INDIVIDUAL. I'M CHOI DONE A FIRE SOUTH OF THE VICTIM IN A RESTRAINING ORDER PROCESS FELT MORE FRIGHTENING AND ONE IS NOT AN OPTION THAT THEY WANTED TO PURSUE. THIS LEGISLATION WOULD PROVIDE A VERY NEEDED WINDOW OF TIME TO RESET BEHAVIORS. AND BREAK THE PATTERN. PUBLIC SAFETY THEY ALREADY HAVE THIS TOOL AN INDIVIDUAL TO ATTEND PRIVATE UNIVERSITY SHOULD NOT BE PROVIDED LESS FAVORABLE SAFETY OPTIONS IN THEIR CAMPUS COMMUNITIES.

SAME SCHOOL WHO TALKED ABOUT- THE CONCERNS THAT THEY HAVE- REGARDING THE RELATIONSHIP. THAT THE SCHOOL HAS DEVELOPED WITH THE NEIGHBORING COMMUNITIES AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS- AND HOW OFTEN TIMES FOLKS WHO LIVE IN THE NEIGHBORING AREA OF SOUTH LA- ARE. EITHER INTIMIDATED OR HARASSED FOR TREATED IN A WAY THAT SEEMS ON KIND BY STUDENTS- OF THE- LAW ENFORCEMENT ENTITY ON THE SCHOOL. AND IT MADE ME THINK OF WHEN I WAS GOING TO SCHOOL. AND RECOGNIZING THAT IT IS A SHORT CUT FOR MANY FOLKS WHO LIVE IN SOUTH LA- INSTEAD OF GOING AROUND THE ENTIRE CAMPUS OFTENTIMES COMMUNITY MEMBERS WOULD WALK THROUGH. BUT IT WAS ALSO EVIDENT THAT THEY READ THEIR BEING PROFILED OR SOMEONE WAS DETERMINING THAT THEY WERE NOT STUDENTS AT THE SCHOOL- AND THEY WOULD BE- STOPPED APPREHENDED- AND DID TOLD TO GET OFF THE CAMPUS- BY CAMPUS POLICE. AND SO I WAS JUST WONDERING- WHEN. WHAT THIS BILL WOULD DO- IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES FOR- THOSE. KINDS OF COMMUNITY MEMBERS- BECAUSE WHILE I AGREE STUDENTS SHOULD BE PENALIZED FOR WHERE THEY GO TO SCHOOL I ALSO AGREE THAT COMMUNITY MEMBERS SHOULD BE PENALIZED FOR WHERE SCHOOLS BEEN BUILT- AND HOW WE DEVELOP. RIGHTEOUS RELATIONSHIPS ARE HOW SCHOOLS DEVELOP RIGHT JUST RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEIR NEIGHBORING COMMUNITIES IS AS IMPORTANT AS MAKING SURE THAT THOSE THAT LIVE OR WORK OR ARE EDUCATED ON THE SCHOOL CAMPUSES ARE ALSO PROTECTED. SO I JUST WANTED TO HEAR FROM YOU TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS LAW WASN'T GOING TO DISPROPORTIONATELY CREATE OPPORTUNITIES FOR COMMUNITY MEMBERS ARE FOLKS THAT ARE DEEMED YOU KNOW INAPPROPRIATE TO BE ON CAMPUS- FROM BEING- UNDULY HARASSED. I THINK IT'S A IT'S AN EXCELLENT QUESTION AND CERTAINLY AN ISSUE THAT EVERY CAMPUS SHOULD BE COGNISANT OF- YOU KNOW COLLEGE CAMPUSES TRADITIONALLY ARE WELCOMING PLACES THEY HAVE. PUBLIC EVENTS IN THERE ARE GALLERIES THEY HAVE THEATER PRODUCTIONS- YOU'RE RIGHT PEOPLE DO YOU SHORT CUTS ACROSS CAMPUSES I DON'T THINK THAT'S THE INTENT OF THIS BILL AT ALL AND I THINK YOUR COMMENTS FOR THE- AICC YOU FOLKS WHO ARE LISTENING SHOULD TAKE IT TO HEART. TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE CAMPUSES DON'T UNDULY- PROFILE OR INTIMIDATE NEIGHBORHOOD FOLKS THIS BILL IS INTENDED FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE CAUSING HARM OR POTENTIAL HARM ON A CAMPUS THAT SOMEHOW MOSTLY ARE RELATED TO THAT CAMPUS WHETHER THAT'S A- DISGRUNTLED EMPLOYEE WHETHER THAT'S SOMEBODY WHO'S MADE THREATS. THIS GIVES PRIVATE COLLEGES THE SAME TOOLS THAT A PUBLIC UNIVERSITY HAS TO DEAL WITH THOSE ISSUES SO THAT'S WHAT THE INTENT OF THIS BILL IS BUT I THINK YOUR QUESTION IS TOTALLY GERMANE TO THE CAMPUS LIFE AN ATMOSPHERE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD DYNAMICS AND- YOU KNOW IS A GOOD. IS A GOOD STATEMENT TO HAVE THOSE COLLEGES BE THINKING ABOUT. I WAS PART OF. THE DAY AND- HI. I WOULD THINK YOU MISTER CHAIR THAT IN MANY INSTANCES AND I CAN THINK OF A NUMBER OF COLLEGES- THAT ARE WELL REGARDED WHERE TUITION IS INCREDIBLY HIGH. THEY HAVE VERY STRONG ALUMNI RELATIONS AND FOLKS GOOD SEND THEIR KIDS THERE BECAUSE THEY ARE EXPECTING M. S. STELLAR EDUCATION AND SAFETY. OFTEN HAPPEN TO BE UP IN. LOWER INCOME COMMUNITIES AND IS REALLY BECAUSE OF AL YOU OF THE LAND WAS SO LOW- YOU KNOW LONG TIME AGO. AND SO. IT'S WHILE WE UNDERSTAND THAT FOLKS ARE THERE YOU KNOW TO GET A GOOD EDUCATION AND IT HAPPENS TO BE A GREAT SCHOOL LOCATED IN I'M AN INTERESTING URBAN SPACE IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT THEY STILL HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO ENGAGE AND TO NOT PROFILE- AND TO NOT USE THIS AS AN ADDITIONAL TOOL- TO MAKE COMMUNITY MEMBERS FEEL DISCONNECTED- FROM A SCHOOL THAT HOPEFULLY WOULD WANT TO- YOU KNOW ADMIT THEM WHEN THEY'RE OF AGE TO GO TO THAT SCHOOL OR EVEN WORK THERE SO I JUST WANTED TO SHARE THAT BECAUSE- IT IT MADE ME THINK OF CONVERSATIONS I'VE HAD WITH STUDENTS ABOUT THE- ABOUT HOW COMMUNITY MEMBERS ARE FELT OR TREATED- BY THE INSTITUTIONS. THANK YOU DEFINITELY A FAIR COMMENT. SKINNER THANK YOU I MISTER CHAIR AND- FIVE WHEN I READ THE SYNOPSIS OF THE BILL IT DIDN'T OCCUR TO ME TO ASK A QUESTION THAT- THAT MS COM ORDERS ARE SENATOR. BASED AND- SO I GUESS I WOULD PUT IT A DIFFERENT WAY AND ASK THE AUTHOR WOOD THIS. WHEN I READ IT I WAS LIKE OKAY THIS IS JUST SAW. ALLOWING THE BENEFIT THAT OTHER. COLLEGE CAMPUSES HALF BUT- I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHETHER THIS. WOULD ALLOW FOR CAMPUS FOR EXAMPLE. TO IN EFFECT CLOSE ITSELF OFF IN OTHER WORDS ENACT A RULE SUCH THAT ONLY. STUDENTS REGISTERED STUDENTS AND- OUR CAMPUS STAFF WITH ID WOULD BE ABLE TO MOVE THROUGH A CAMPUS AND THE REASON I ASK IS INTERESTINGLY- THE SENATORS AT. I GAVE THE EXAMPLE OF U. S. C. AND WE'RE IT SITUATED- I CAN GIVE THE EXAMPLE OF THE COLLEGE IN MY OWN TOWN UC BERKELEY WHICH LITERALLY. UC BERKELEY IS AT TELEGRAPH AVENUE ENDS RIGHT UC BERKELEY. AND IN EFFECT IF YOU WERE WALKING ACROSS THE CAMPUS IT BEGINS AGAIN THOUGH NOT UNDER THE SAME NAME BUT UNDER THE NAME EUCLID AVENUE. ACROSS THE CAMPUS AND- THE ONLY WAY IF YOU'RE WALKING TO GET TO THOSE SPOTS QUICKLY IS TO GO THROUGH THE CAMPUS YOU YOU REALLY HAVE OTHERWISE YOU WOULD HAVE TO GO MANY MANY MANY BLOCKS OUT OF YOUR WAY. AND INTERESTINGLY DURING THE PANDEMIC. THE BECAUSE MOST PEDESTRIANS IN BERKELEY USE THAT ROUTE. THE DURING THE PANDEMIC THE CAMPUS. BASICALLY SAID WELL THEY'RE GOING TO CLOSE IT OFF SO THAT NO PUBLIC COULD WALK THROUGH. AND THERE WAS A HUGE UPROAR IN MY COMMUNITY BECAUSE OF COURSE THAT WOULD MAKE IT REALLY HARD TO GET. TO IT I MEAN THERE IT'S A SHOPPING DISTRICT IN SUCH- SO THE UNIVERSITY PULLED BACK BUT I'M JUST WONDERING WOOD. WITH THIS BILL ALLOW SUCH PROVISION BECAUSE I DID NOT LOOK AT IT FROM THAT LEADS WHY I THINK WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL THAT THE PICNIC IS DIFFERENT. THAN YOU KNOW NORMAL ACTIVITY AND COLLEGE CAMPUSES UNDER NORMAL ACTIVITY HAVE SPORTING EVENTS- WHICH THE PUBLIC HAS ACCESS TO THEY HAVE AS I SAID THEATER PRODUCTIONS- THEY HAVE FACILITIES THEY HAVE. THE YOU KNOW TRADITIONALLY COLLEGE CAMPUSES HAVE A VERY STRONG PUBLIC PRESENCE WITH THIS BILL IS DESIGNED TO DO IS TO DEAL WITH THAT PERSON WHO WAS BEING DISRUPTIVE ON A CAMPUS WHO POSES A THREAT. TO STUDENTS ON THAT CAMPUS AND I WOULD ARGUE THAT MANY OF THE PRIVATE COLLEGES ARE ACTUALLY MORE DIVERSE. STUDENT POPULATIONS UNFORTUNATELY IN OUR PUBLIC UNIVERSITY SO THIS IS PROTECTING ALL STUDENTS FROM THAT POTENTIAL HARMFUL ACT IT'S NOT GIVING THEM THE TOOLS TO BORDER. THEIR COLLEGE CAMPUSES FROM THE PUBLIC INTERACTION WHICH. IS NOT A NORMAL COURSE OF EVENTS ON DIFFICULT CAMPUSES. AND SO I THINK THAT'S A WE HAVE TO AT AND FOR EXAMPLE BERKELEY HAS THE TOOLS WERE STANFORD DOESN'T. CALCULATE CAL STATE LA HAS THE TOOL WHERE USC DOESN'T THIS IS JUST PROVIDING PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE THEIR STUDENTS SAFE. FROM THAT OF ABERRATION. PERSON WHO POSES OF IMMINENT THREAT TO THE WELFARE OF THOSE STUDENTS UNDER THE CURRENT SYSTEM THAT PERSON CAN KEEP COMING BACK AD INFINITUM. AND POTENTIALLY YOU KNOW WITH A WEAPON. AND HURT SOMEBODY AND SO THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS SEEKING TO DO IT'S NOT SEEKING TO PUT A WALL AROUND CAMPUS. THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS. BOB SENATOR I WOULD JUST GO BACK TO THE QUESTION THAT- CENTER COM MODERATES AS IT RELATES TO- USC IN THE SURROUNDING AREAS AND JUST USING THAT AS AN EXAMPLE AND YOUR RESPONSE WAS LESS THE DEFINITIVE OF WHAT I WOULD HAVE HOPED YOU SAID I HOPE THAT'S NOT THE INTENT VERSUS BEING DEFINITIVE TO SAY THAT IS NOT DOWN TO THAT IS IF I SAID HOPE IT THAT IS NOT OKAY. I WAS JUST TALKING TO A LITTLE CONCERNED THAT. YOU MIGHT NOT SURE. THE CONCERNS AT THE CENTRE REYES WILL BE ADDRESSED HERE SO LET'S. WE ALL WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. IT IS OPENS BECAUSE I'VE KNOWN THAT COMMUNITY SINCE I WAS A LITTLE KID AND YOU KNOW I. RELATIVES LIVED IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD AND YET. THE SUPPLY ON THAT CAMPUS AND WITHOUT ANY THOUGHTS AND FEARS OF BEING A ROUTE SO I HOPE THAT WOULD NOT BE THE CASE TODAY NOT. OKAY HEARING NO FURTHER QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS SENATOR WHICH ELECT CLOSE- I THINK THE CONVERSATION WAS VERY IMPORTANT I THINK THE COMMENTS WERE. QUITE GERMANE AND I HOPE. THE COLLEGES ON THE PHONE OR LISTENING YOU KNOW WE WANT OUR COLLEGES DID BE SAFE WELCOMING INSTITUTIONS TO SERVE THE YOUNG PEOPLE. AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. Q. WE A TO PASS TO REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON CORPORATIONS I DON'T KNOW IF WE'LL GET OUT OF THAT COMMITTEE BUT I- CAN WE GET A MOTION. FOUR SB SEVEN FOUR EIGHT. SO MOVED BY CENTER CAR MARKER.

WILL HELP US TO ADDRESS THE ONGOING- SPITE- WHICH HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR YEARS AND IS NOW ACCELERATING OF. OVERDOSE THE OVERDOSES AND OVERDOSE DEATHS IN CALIFORNIA. BY ALLOWING BUT NOT MANDATING. SAN FRANCISCO OAKLAND AND LOS ANGELES COUNTIES IF THEY DECIDE. NOT BE ABILITY TO AUTHORIZE OVERDOSE PREVENTION PROGRAMS ALSO KNOWN AS SAFE CONSUMPTION SITES- THIS SET CONSUMPTION SITES ARE PROGRAMS. WHERE AN INDIVIDUAL CAN USE A CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF STAFF WHO ARE TRAINED TO PREVENT AND TREAT OVERDOSES AND ALSO TO PREVENT HIV AND HEPATITIS INFECTION AND FACILITATE ENTRY INTO SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER TREATMENT AND OTHER RECOVERY SERVICES- AND OTHER SUPPORT SERVICES- SIX CONSUMPTION SITES ARE A CRITICAL INTERVENTION TO PREVENT OVERDOSE DEATHS. APPROXIMATELY ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY OF THESE SITES EXIST IN TEN COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD. THEY HAVE BEEN RIGOROUSLY STUDIED FOR YEARS AND THEY HAVE BEEN SHOWN OVER AND OVER AGAIN TO REDUCE HEALTH AND SAFETY PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH DRUG USE. INCLUDING PUBLIC DRUG USE. TO REDUCE SURRENDER LETTER. TO REDUCE HIV AND HEPATITIS INFECTIONS AND TO REDUCE OVERDOSE THOSE DEATHS. THAT IS ONE PER AND ONLY TURN YOUR CALL AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. MODERATOR OKAY. NINE ZERO AT AT THE ONE I AND SEVENTY- SIX CONSUMPTION SITES AROUND THE WORLD SOME OF WHICH HAVE BEEN IN PLACE FOR DECADES THERE HAS NEVER NOT ONCE BEEN A RECORDED ONLY NINETEEN BUSINESS TELLING SUCH SUPPLEMENTS KILEY I'M UNAVAILABLE TO TAKE YOUR CALL AT THE TONE PLEASE RECORD MY. BAT PERHAPS THE WATER TO QUIT. YOU YEAH. BLINDS YES THANK YOU THANK YOU. OKAY R. P. THOUSAND IMPORTANT POINTS I GOT INTERRUPTED AT THESE ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SITES AROUND THE WORLD THAT HAVE BEEN OPERATING FOR YEARS AND YEARS THERE HAS NEVER ONCE NOT ONCE BEEN RECORDED OVERDOSE DEATH. COMPARE THAT TO WHAT'S HAPPENING ON OUR STREETS RIGHT NOW WE'RE IN SAN FRANCISCO ALONE WE HAD SEVEN HUNDRED OVERDOSE DEATHS LAST YEAR. AND THE SAME IS HAPPENING AROUND THE STATE. BY THESE SITES. REDUCE THE SEARCH REDUCE EMERGENCY ROOM VISITS SO INSTEAD OF GOING TO AN EMERGENCY ROOM. PEOPLE ARE TAKING CARE OF THE REDUCES PRESSURE ON OUR HOSPITALS REDUCE HIS PARAMEDIC CALLS WE KNOW THAT IN MANY OF OUR CITIES ARE FOR OUR FIRE DEPARTMENT OR PARAMEDICS ARE HAVING TO SPEND A LOT OF TIME DEALING WITH DRUG USE ISSUES- THIS PREVENTS THOSE. WE NO FROM THE STUDY SAID OVERDOSE PREVENTION PROGRAM SAFE CONSUMPTION SITES I DO NOT INCREASE CRIME IN FACT THERE'S SOME INDICATION THAT THEY REDUCE CRIME IN THE SURROUNDING. AREA. THERE IS A REDUCTION IN SYRINGE LITTER WE KNOW THAT IT IS A PROBLEM WHEN PEOPLE USE SYRINGES AND DROP THEM. ON THE GROUNDS. AND THEY INCREASE ENTRY INTO RECOVERY PROGRAMS. MANY SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER TREATMENT ORGANIZATIONS ARE SUPPORTING THIS BILL. SIJSLING BECAUSE BY THESE SITES HELP TRANSITION PEOPLE INTO RECOVERY. WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE A CRISIS ON OUR HANDS WITH WITH SUBSTANCE USE AND OVERDOSE DEATHS THE PANDEMIC IS MAKING IT WORSE. TOM WE HAVE STAFF AND THAT IS WHY WE ARE SEEING RECORD OVER THOSE STUFFS AND CITIES AROUND CALIFORNIA. I WANT TO BE CLEAR ON SOME INCLUDING IN THE OPPOSITION. TALK AS THEY OFTEN DO THAT THIS IS SOMEHOW. GOING TO INCREASE DRUG USE OR FACILITATE DRUG USE OR NORMALIZED ARGUES WE NEED TO BE CLEAR THE DRUG USE IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW IT'S HAPPENING IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND PARTICULARLY HAPPENING ON OUR STREETS ON OUR SIDEWALKS IN FRONT OF PEOPLE'S HOMES IN PARKS. IN BUSINESSES BEHIND DUMPSTERS AND ALL SORTS OF PLACES WHERE IT IS ON SANITARY- AND UNHEALTHY. AND WE KNOW FROM INTERVIEWS- THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO INJECT IN PUBLIC PRECISELY BECAUSE- THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IF THEY OVERDOSE THAT PEOPLE WILL SEE THEM AND SOMEONE WILL BE ABLE TO SAVE THEM. WE KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING LET'S MAKE IT SAFER AND HEALTHIER BY GIVING PEOPLE THE ABILITY TO MOVE INSIDE INTO A CLEAN AND HEALTHY CITING. SO IF THEY DO OVERDOSE SOMEONE WILL BE THERE TO REVERSE THAT OVERDOSE OR TO SEND THEM TO AN ER- IF NECESSARY- AND LET'S HELP THEM DEVELOP THOSE RELATIONSHIPS WITH PEOPLE WHO CAN HELP GET THEM INTO.

ANDCOMMONS- WITH REGARDS TO THIS BILL- IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN GOVERNOR BROWN TO- VETOED A SIMILAR BILL- IN PART SEVERAL CONCERNS BUT ONE OF THE CONCERNS THAT THEY MENTIONED WAS THE UNITED STATES ATTORNEY GENERAL THREATENING SOME PROSECUTION DO WE KNOW WORK THE- IF. YOU HAVE RECEIVED ANY MESSAGING OR ANY INFORMATION AS FAR AS HOW THE NOTICES ATTORNEY GENERAL WOULD FEEL ABOUT. IMPLEMENTING THESE THIS BILL HERE IN CALIFORNIA. I YES EXCUSE ME- IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN- SADLY GOVERNOR AROUND I'VE ENORMOUS RESPECT FOR GOVERNOR BROWN BUT HE WAS JUST DEAD WRONG WHEN HE VETOED OUT OUR PARTICULAR BILL BY THEN ASSEMBLY MEMBER SUSAN EGGMAN- AND WITH A PRETTY MUCH A JUST SAY NO- MESSAGE WHICH- WE'VE KNOWN FOR FIFTY FOR FIFTY YEARS A PRACTICE JUST DOESN'T WORK. ON THAT WAS A- A THREAT FROM THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION- THE- THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION SUED PHILADELPHIA TRUMP ADMINISTRATION MADE THREATS AGAINST OUR CALIFORNIA- WE HAVE A NEW ADMINISTRATION NOW THAT TAKES A LOT MORE FORWARD LOOKING. APPROACH TO MANY HEALTH ISSUES AND SO WE HAVE NOT DONE OF ANY STATEMENTS- FROM THE BITING HARRIS ADMINISTRATION- BUT I SUSPECT. WE WILL HAVE A MORE- MORE OR LESS COST APPROACH BUT I WE HAVENO COMMUNITY. FROM THEM. KEEP IN MIND THAT WE'RE GOING THROUGH THIS WITH CANNABIS WHERE THERE WERE TIMES WHEN WE HAD HOSTILE FEDERAL ADMINISTRATIONS BUT WE STILL WERE ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD. AND DO WE HAVE ANY MODELS OF THIS BILL. IN PLACE IN OTHER STATES HERE IN THE US AND ALSO JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT THIS- THE TWO SIDES WOULD VIOLATE FEDERAL LAW. AND THAT IS CURRENTLY BEING LITIGATED AND THERE WAS A DISTRICT COURT DECISION IN PHILADELPHIA STATING THAT THEY DON'T VIOLATE FEDERAL LAW THAT'S BEEN DISPUTED ON APPEAL KNAUS- SO- IN TERMS OF OUR MODELS NO IT'S NEVER. BEEN IMPLEMENTED IN THE U. US IN IMPLEMENTER ON THE WORLD THERE IS ONE STUDY. THAT CAME OUT OF A- MORE OF AN UNDERGROUND SORRY THAT WAS NOT LEGAL. WE DON'T KNOW WHERE IT WAS- BUT THEY'D COLLECTED A LOT OF DATA I HAVE VERY POSITIVE RESULTS CONSISTENT WITH RESULTS THAT WE'VE SEEN AROUND THE WORLD. FIVE- I KNOW OVER THOSE DEATHS. REDUCING A HEALTH PROBLEMS. AND SO ON AND SO FORTH. DO YOU HAVE ANY DATA WITH REGARDS TO THE- SOCIAL CULTURAL- UNDERSTANDING YOUR PERCEPTIONS OF DRUG USE. AS FAR AS WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS- AS FAR AS HAS THE PERCEPTION OR THE ACCEPTANCE OF DRUG USE INCREASED DECREASED WITHIN THAT CULTURAL- SOCIETY OKAY I DON'T THINK THAT IT DID THE SITES INCREASE OR DECREASE- DESIRE RECEPTIVITY TO DRUG USE HAVING TO BE APPROACH HERE IS THAT DRUG USE IS WHAT IT IS. PEOPLE USE DRUGS FOR MANY MANY DIFFERENT REASONS- THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO WILL USE DRUGS THEIR WHOLE LIFE THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO VERY MUCH WANT TO STOP USING. DRUGS AND THE GOAL IS TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE REALITY OF THE WORLD BUT PEOPLE USE DRUGS WE TRIED TO THROW PEOPLE IN JAIL THAT DIDN'T WORK. WE TRIED TO BERATE PEOPLE TO JUST SAY NO THAT DIDN'T WORK- AND RECOGNIZING THE REALITY THE IDEA IS HOW DO WE MAKE IT SO THAT FEWER PEOPLE- OVERDOSE AND DIE SO THE FEWER PEOPLE GET HIV AND HEPATITIS. HOW DO WE MAKE IT TO THE PEOPLE ARE INJECTING ON THE SIDEWALK WHERE PEOPLE WALKING BY WITH THEIR CHILDREN- HOW DO WE HELP FACILITATE PEOPLE AND THE RECOVERY OF BALLOTS WHERE THEY WANT TO GO. AND THESE PROGRAMS HAVE SHOWN THAT THEY DO ALL OF THAT- AND SERVE I DON'T IT DOESN'T THERE'S NO INDICATION THAT IT INCREASES DRUG USE THERE IS AN INDICATION THAT IT HELPS THE PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE GET INTO RECOVERY. SO THEY USE DRUGS LESS OR MAYBE STOPPERS ARE LIKE. THE BILL DOES NOT MANDATE TREATMENT ONCE YOU'RE USING ARE YOUR ALLOWED TO USE WITHIN THESE FACILITIES RIGHT THE BILL IS NOT MANDATORY MEN- MANDATING TREATMENT- YOU KNOW IT IS IT IS NOT- FACTORS TYPICALLY- FOR MOST PEOPLE- THERE MIGHT BE. SOME EXTREME CASES WHERE- WHERE WHERE YOU HAVE TO CONSIDER DIFFERENT OPTIONS BUT FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE USING DRUGS. MANDATING TREATMENT ISN'T PROBABLY GOING TO HELP THEM WHAT DOES HELP THEM IS TO OFFER THEM RESOURCES AND SERVICES. AND TO STOP THEM FROM OVERDOSING AND DYING. YOU KNOW IT'S VERY INTERESTING BECAUSE I AM VERY MUCH. INTERESTED IN BEHAVIOR HEALTH AS AN UNDERLYING FACTOR IN MANY OF THE ISSUES THAT WE SEE ACROSS MANY. DEMOGRAPHICS AND- AGENCIES ENTITIES I AM WHAT HAVE YOU IN IN- IN THE U. S. AND THE WORLD BUT SPECIFICALLY SPEAKING WITH REGARDS TO THE U. S. AND I LOOK AT THE ISSUES RIGHT NOW AND I AM LOOKING TO APPROACH ISSUES IN A WAY THAT. TRIED TO TREAT. THE PROBLEMS AT THE ROOT OF THE PROBLEM AND. THIS AS YOU SAY IT IS A REALITY OF WHAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW UNFORTUNATELY AND I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW DO WE- HOW DO WE- WILL. REDUCE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE. GETTING INTO ARE BEING ADDICTED TO DRUGS. AND THE CONCERNS THAT I HAVE IT OUR WITH REGARDS TO CREATING. A CULTURE AND THIS IS WHY I ASKED ABOUT YOU KNOW THE DATA IN OTHER COUNTRIES IN THE PERCEPTION THE CULTURAL ACCEPTANCE OF. OF DRUG USE IS IT BECAUSE RIGHT NOW I THINK- IN MY MIND I SEE MANY PEOPLE WHO USE DRUGS ENTERING BECAUSE OF BEHAVIOR HELP IN TRYING TO DEAL WITH HIM BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE THE COPING SKILLS THEY HAVEN'T BEEN TAUGHT THE COPING SKILLS. TO DEAL WITH ISSUES AND SO THAT IS ONE VENUE THAT THEY USED TO. MEDICATE THEMSELVES ANYWAY- SO YOU SEE IT AS THE HEALTH PROBLEMS OF THE BEHAVIOR HEALTH PROBLEM. AND FOR SOME IT'S JUST SOMETHING THAT THEY DID BECAUSE IT WAS- YOU KNOW USE AMONGST THEIR THEIR PEERS- FROM THE THAT THEY JUST TRIED ONCE AND THEN BECAME ADDICTED TO. OUR EVENTUALLY SO THERE'S A LOT OF ISSUES THAT GO INTO THE DRUG USE. BUT THE CONCERN THAT I HAVE IS ONE. IS IT CREATING THESE SITES AND THE ALLOWING SOME OF THE POPULATION TO FEEL THAT IT IS OKAY IT WILL BE SAFE TO DO DRUGS OR TO EXPERIMENT BECAUSE THERE'S A SAFETY NET BEHIND IT- AND I'M NOT SURE WHETHER OR NOT IT WOULD AND I AND I DON'T KNOW THIS IS WHY I ASKED FOR FREE CITIES OR OR DATA ON THAT BUT I'M NOT SURE THAT. THIS WOULD. CURTAIL SOMEONE'S- FEAR OR I'M NOT SURE WHAT COULD HELP THEM NOT WANT TO PURSUE OR TRY DRUGS- IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT I WOULD BE COMPELLED TO USE OR OR OR DO BUT I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF INDIVIDUALS WITH DIFFERENT CULTURAL BACKGROUNDS AND LIFE EXPERIENCES THAT MIGHT BE MORE- RECEPTIVE TO- OR MORE. AB MUSIC RECEPTIVE AT MORE PRONE TO USE THEIR DRUGS I'M JUST CAN NERVOUS THAT THIS THAT THIS BILL IN PLACE WOULD MAKE IT A LITTLE EASIER FOR PEOPLE TO AT LEAST TRY AND NOT KNOWING THEIR GENETIC MAKEUP OR PRIEST DISPOSITION TO ADDICTION THAT THIS WOULD CREATE A CYCLE THAT WOULD MAKE- CERTAIN DESERT ERROR ISSUES A LITTLE OF THE ISSUE WORSE- THIS IS WHY I WAS ASKING WHETHER OR NOT YOU HAVE ANY DATA. ON WHETHER OR NOT CULTURALLY OR SO IN IN THERE IN THOSE COMMUNITIES ARE THIS COUNTRY'S THE DRUG USE INCREASED OR DECREASED AND THE PERCEPTION OF IT IF IT WAS. SOMETHING THAT WAS STILL. LOOKED UPON NEGATIVELY OR IF IT WAS LOOKED UPON AS SOMETHING IT'S OKAY. IF YOU'RE GONNA USE IT BECAUSE THERE'S A SAFETY NET THE HIGH DO YOU HAVE ANY. OR FOR. YEAH AND TO BE CLEAR WE ALL. PEOPLE TO BE HELL AND THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE YOU DRUGS OUT WANT TO STOP USING. AND THAT WE WANT WE WANT TO HELP THEM STOP USING BUT ABOVE ALL WE WANT THEM TO BE SAFE AND NOT DIE. AND WE HAVE TRIED THE APPROACHES OF THIS YEAR LECTURING PEOPLE AND TELLING THEM TO STOP USING- WE TRIED THE STRATEGY OF THROWING THEM IN JAIL. AND IT HASN'T WORKED YOU KNOW BECAUSE WE HAVE MORE. DRUG USE AND ADDICTION NOW THAN THAN IN THE PAST AND SO YOUR THIS IS ON. THE VERGE OF THE SITE DON'T. GET PEOPLE STARTED ON USING DRUGS THESE SITES ARE FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN FRANKLY USING PROBABLY FOR A WHILE. OFTEN ON OUR STREETS. THESE ARE PROBABLY YOU KNOW FOR SOME OF OUR MOST MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES OF DRUG USERS- AND THAT WERE OFFERING THEM A SERVICE. WHERE THEY CAN USE. IN A MUCH SAFER ENVIRONMENT- REDUCE THE RISK OF IN FACT. AND OVERDOSE DEATHS- AND GET ACCESS TO SERVICES AND IN THESE PROGRAMS NOT EVERYONE BUT A SIGNIFICANT PERCENTAGE. OF PEOPLE ULTIMATELY GO INTO RECOVERY SO THESE CENTERS. THESE SITES HELP PEOPLE AND TO RECOVER MAYBE THEY'LL DO IT THE FIRST TIME TO GO THERE MAYBE IT'LL BE THE FIFTIETH TIME TO GO THERE. BUT EVENTUALLY A GOOD NUMBER OF THEM WILL GOING TO RECOVERY AND THIS WILL HELP THEM DO SO AND WILL HELP KEEP THEM ALIVE. AS THEY MAKE THAT JOURNEY TOWARDS RECOVERY. I RESPECT THAT. THE INTENT. I'M JUST CONCERNED THAT HAVING THESE FACILITIES AND MAKING AB- OF MAKING THEM READILY AVAILABLE OR BEING APPROVED. CREATES A SENSE OUR PERCEPTION THAT IT'S OKAY TO TRY I'M AND I'M TALKING ABOUT THE I AND I KNOW THIS IS INTENDED FOR PEOPLE WHO'VE BEEN USING FOR A WHILE BUT- EVERYTHING THAT WE DO CREATE A CERTAIN. PERCEPTION OR CULTURAL ACCEPTANCE OF ISSUES AND I'M JUST CONCERNED THAT THISBILL. WOULD CREATE A PERCEPTION THAT IT'S OKAY. BECAUSE THERE'S A SAFETY NET- SO. I'M JUST CONCERNED ABOUT THE LONG TERM EFFECTS OF. EATING AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE WE THINK THAT IT'S OKAY TO TRY AND- BY PROVIDING BUT I DO RESPECT THE- INTENT OF TRYING TO SAVE LIVES BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT- BUT I'M JUST I'M A LITTLE HESITANT ABOUT THE- FORWARD THINKING AND- MORAL ACCEPTANCE OF DRUG USE- EVENTUALLY. I RESPECT THAT I HAVE A DIFFERENT DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE THANK THANK YOU SYNERGEN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN OF- THANK YOU CENTER WIN FOR BRINGING THE BILL THIS THESE QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER A PROGRAM LIKE THIS IN EFFECT. JUSTIFIES WERE- CREATES A PERMISSIVE CIRCUMSTANCE FOR ORTIZ SAYS TO A USER HEY IT'S OKAY TO USE- THESE ARE DIFFICULT OUTSIDE AS YOU QUESTIONS THAT WE ALL GRAPPLE WITH BECAUSE IT WILL BE FOR ONE WHEN I'VE LOOKED AT RESEARCH. THERE ARE VERY VERY FEW ADDICTS WHO IN ANY WAY OUR. PROUDER PLEASED TO BE AN ADDICT THAT MOST ADDICTS REALLY WOULD PREFER NOT TO BE NOW. IT THESE TYPE OF ADDICTIONS I THINK MOST OF US KNOW ARE REALLY HARD TO KICK. M. BUT THE THING THAT'S I FIND REALLY INTERESTING ABOUT THE RESEARCH IS THAT. THE TYPE OF INJECTABLE DRUGS THAT WOULD BE- SAFE IN THESE TYPE OF SETTINGS. THEIR USE HAS INCREASED ACROSS EVERY DEMOGRAPHIC IN THE U. S. IN THE LAST TWENTY YEARS EVERY DEMOGRAPHIC. IN INTERESTINGLY THE FOLKS THAT WOULD USE THE SITES ARE PEOPLE THAT BY AND LARGE DON'T HAVE A PLACE WHERE THEY CAN. USE IT'S NOT TO SAY THAT ANY USER SAY A WEALTHY USER IS ANY SAFER THEY CAN DIE OF AN OVERDOSE ALSO. BUT THEY THEY CAN BE AT HOME OR THEY CAN BE AMENDED IN OTHER WORDS THIS THESE TYPE OF SITES ARE REALLY MUCH MORE USED FOR USERS THAT. IN FACT HAVE NOWHERE ELSE TO GO AND POSSIBLY ARE USING MORE BECAUSE EITHER THEY LIVE ON THE STREET OR THEIR CIRCUMSTANCES ARE SUCH. AND THAT ITS POTENTIAL THAT BY THIS SUCH A SITE. THEY MAY USE LESS. THEY THEN HAVE ACCESS TO PEOPLE WHO COULD. PUT THEM ON A PATH TOWARDS TREATMENT THEY ALSO HAVE MORE ACCESS I MEAN THE OTHER RESEARCH SHOWS THAT FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU'RE A VERY LOW INCOME USER. IF YOU HAVE EATEN IF YOU'VE HAD NEW YOUR NUTRITION MET YOU USE LESS. THEY'RE ALL THESE FACTORS THAT CONTRIBUTE. TO- EITHER A PATHWAY TO GET OFF OF THE DRUG OR TO USE LESS OF IT. AND SUCH A SITE IN THE RESEARCH THAT I'VE LOOKED AT WOULD HELP FACILITATE THAT DOESN'T GUARANTEE IT BUT IT WOULD HELP FACILITATE IT. NOW THE OTHER THING IS THAT UNFORTUNATELY. OVERDOSES NOW BECAUSE OF THE WAY VERY SEIZE DRUGS ARE BEING SPIKED WHETHER WITH FAT NO OR OTHER MATERIALS. ARE ON THE RISE ALSO VERY SIGNIFICANTLY AND AGAIN OKAY OF CROSSED ALL DEMOGRAPHIC GROUPS. BUT THIS HAS THE HOPE FOR REDUCING THE DEATH BECAUSE- YOU KNOW ONCE A PERSON'S TED FROM AN OVERDOSE THERE IS NO HOPE OF GETTING THEM OVER THEIR ADDICTION HOWEVER. THERE IS STILL THE POSSIBILITY TO GET PASSED IN ADDICTION EVEN IF YOUR USER BUT NOT ONE TO VOTE DE AND IN SUCH A SITE THERE WOULD BE THE IMMEDIATE ACCESS TO THE- THE DRUGS NOR CAN AND SUCH THAT CAN HELP PREVENT OR STOP THE DEATH FROM THE OVERDOSE. SO I THINK THIS IS AN IMPORTANT. PILOT TWO AND IT WOULD GIVE US A LOT MORE INFORMATION THIS IS NOT ALLOWING THIS ACROSS THE WHOLE STATE BUT IT WOULD GIVE US MORE INFORMATION AS TO WHETHER THE FOLKS THAT UTILIZE SUCH A PILOT. ACTUALLY THEN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF MORE SERVICES TO GET OFF OF THEIR ADDICTION. AND YOU KNOW IF IT DOES NOT TURN OUT TO BE SO THAT'S THAT MUCH MORE INFORMATION WE HAVE- BUT I THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT ONE TO TRY- I WAS FRUSTRATED WHEN GOVERNOR BROWN. VETOED THE LAST BILL. AND- ALL OF HIS- REASONINGS I MEAN GOVERNOR BROWN HAS A- KIND OF DFFERENT ATTITUDE ON DRUG USE WHICH LOOK- I DON'T FAULT ANYONE FOR. I THINK ALL OF US WOULD PREFER THAT THERE NOT BE ANY ADDICTS OF ANY SORT WHETHER IT'S ALCOHOL INJECTABLE DRUGS OR ANY OTHER. HOWEVER WE DO KNOW THAT IT'S QUITE RAMPANT AND ESPECIALLY AN INJECTABLE DRUGS UNFORTUNATELY NOW AND ACROSS ALL DEMOGRAPHICS. AND THE THREAT OF. FEDERAL FEDS COMING DOWN US AT THE TIME WAS REAL IT WOULD BE LESS NOW IT'S NOT TO SAY THAT IT'S ABSOLUTELY THE MINUTES WERE IT'S STILL NOT FEDERAL LAW TO ALLOW BUT WE'RE THERE WOULD PROBABLY BE A DIFFERENT. PERSPECTIVE BUT WE WILL SEE BUT I THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT PILOT TO TRY BECAUSE IT WOULD GIVE US SOME INFORMATION AND WITHOUT ALL MOVE THE BILL. THANK YOU IN THE CAR A SENATOR CALM WATER THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I TOO WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL AND- I THINK I'M A CO AUTHOR I JUST WANTED TO ADD IT- IT'S- I THINK WE WANT TO BE OPERATIONAL WHEN WE TALK ABOUT. DRUG USE AND DRUG ADDICTION AND- PEOPLE NOT WANTING TO BE ON DRUGS. YOU KNOW THE REALITY IS THAT WHILE THERE ARE SOME FOLKS WHO ARE TRYING TO GET OFF THEIR ALSO FOLKS WHO ARE NOT. YOU KNOW WHO- LIKE DRUGS LIKE DOING DRUGS LIKE STAYING HIGH FOR WHATEVER THE REASON IS AND I THINK WHEN WE START HAVING THOSE DISCUSSIONS. IT MOVES FROM BEING- CONVERSATION AROUND POLICY. TO BEING ONE AROUND MORALITY. AND THAT ISN'T REALLY SOMETHING THAT. WE SHOULD BE IN THE BUSINESS OF TRYING TO LEGISLATE- THE MORALITY OF HOW FOLKS LIVE THEIR LIFE I THINK. WHEN WE'RE ASKING WHERE WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT DRUG USE AND ABUSE AND ADDICTION AND OVERDOSING. THEN WE'RE ESSENTIALLY PUSHING USERS WERE KEEPING THEM IN THE SHADOWS- AND NOT ALLOWING US TO HAVE HONEST CONVERSATIONS ABOUT PROGRAMMING AROUND SUPPORT AROUND HOW TO GET HELP- BECAUSE WE'RE NOT BEING HONEST ABOUT THE CHALLENGES THAT FOLKS ARE FACING AND THE IMPACT THAT DRUG USE AND ABUSE HAS ON COMMUNITIES I SUPPORT THE FACT THAT THIS IS A PILOT PROGRAM I THINK THERE'S A SUNSET OF IT. ON IT FOR TWENTY TWENTY SEVEN AND LET'S SEE WHAT WORKS BECAUSE WHAT ISN'T WORKING IS NOT TALKING ABOUT IT NOT FIGURING OUT WAYS TO DEAL WITH IT NOT MEETING PEOPLE WHERE THEY ARE WITH THEIR ADDICTION. AND ALLOWING- UNDERGROUND MARKET TO PROLIFERATE WHERE FOLKS ARE TAKING LOTS OF DRUGS TO THE SKINNER'S POINT AND ACTUALLY TAKING MORE BAD DRUGS- THAT ARE CUT WITH NASTY SUBSTANCES- THAT LEAD TO GREATER ADDICTION AND TO DEATH. AND BY NOT CREATING THESE KINDS OF SITES YOU ACTUALLY STILL CONTINUE TO PERMIT. DRUG USED TO HAPPEN WHERE YOU REALLY DON'T WANT TO SEE IT. IN FRONT OF CHILD CARE CENTERS ARE AT THE BUS STOP OUT IN THE OPEN- SO WHY DON'T WE ACKNOWLEDGE THE ADDICTION CRISIS THAT WE HAVE. AND TRY SOMETHING TRY AND APPROACH. TO FORCE THE ISSUE AROUND WHAT RECOVERY LOOKS LIKE WHAT ADDICTION LOOKS LIKE- YOU KNOW HOW TO MEET PEOPLE WHERE THEY ARE. THERE HAVE BEEN STUDIES THAT HAVE SHOWN IN OTHER COUNTRIES THAT WHEN YOU HAVE THESE KINDS OF SITES YOU ACTUALLY DO DECREASE. OR MENTAL BEHAVIOR AND ACTIVITY- AND THERE IS A GREATER ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF ABUSE AND THERE'S ACTUALLY GREATER INFUSION OF RESOURCES TO HELP DEAL WITH- BEHAVIORAL CHALLENGES AND ADDICTION. BUT IT DOESN'T HAPPEN WITHOUT THE KIND OF ACKNOWLEDGEMENT- AND SAVE SPACE FOR PEOPLE TO TALK ABOUT AND TO SHOW- YOU KNOW THEY'RE CRISIS- AND WE'VE BEEN. IT REMINDS ME ACTUALLY OF THE HEARING WE HAD RIGHT BEFORE BREAK- WITH FAMILIES TALKING ABOUT ADDICTION AND OVERDOSE AND MANY OF THOSE WERE STORIES OF FOLKS KIND OF IN THE SHADOWS. DEALING WITH DRUG USE AND THIS IS AN ATTEMPT TO REALLY YOU KNOW RECONCILE I THINK HOW WE CONTINUE TO CHASTISE FOLKS- FOR BAD DECISIONS THAT THEY MAKE OR FOR FRAILTIES THAT WE ALL- FIVE EIGHT. SO I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY I'M SUPPORTING THIS BILL ON MY JOINED ON AS A CO AUTHOR RECOGNIZING IN LOS ANGELES IN PARTICULAR WE HAVE HUGE HOT SPOTS. OF DRUG USE. AND WE HAVE GOT TO GET CONTROL OVER THAT IN THE CONTROL ISN'T CHARGING FOLKS WITH CRIMES AND PUTTING THEM IN JAIL AND PRISON WHERE THEY STILL HAVE ACCESS TO DRUGS THAT ARE WORSE- AND THE ANSWER ISN'T TO TURN A BLIND EYE AND SAY OKAY BECAUSE I DON'T DO IT. THAT MEANS IT ISN'T HAPPENING AND AS LONG AS IT'S NOT IN MY FAMILY THEN I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT- SO I THINK. WHILE I'M CERTAINLY YOU KNOW NOT A FAN. OF DRUG USE. I RECOGNIZE THAT WE- HAVE BEEN DENYING REALITIES OF IT FOR A REALLY LONG TIME. AND I'M INTERESTED IN. TRYING SOMETHING ELSE AS A SOLUTION- TO HELP CITIES THAT ARE CHALLENGED BY THIS- TO FIGURE OUT NEW WAYS OF DEALING WITH IT SO I AM SUPPORTING THE AUTHOR AND JUST WANTED TO SHARE BECAUSE I- REALLY HEAR WHAT YOU'RE SAYING ABOUT HOW DO WE CREATE A SPACE WHERE WE'RE NOT CONDONING DRUG USE- AND I DON'T THINK ANYONE IS CONDONING IT. BUT I CERTAINLY I HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IT'S A REALITY- AND THEN HOW DO I WORK TO TRY TO HELP ALL PARTIES INVOLVED. THE BYSTANDERS WHO WERE TRYING TO GO FROM POINT A TO POINT B. AND THE FOLKS WHO WERE USING AND ALSO THE FOLKS WHO WERE SELLING. AND LIKE THE FACT THAT WE DON'T HAVE THESE KINDS OF SPACES BECAUSE IT ALLOWS THEM TO HAVE A PROLIFERATION OF THEIR OWN BUSINESS- AND I THINK IN A WAY THIS ALSO ADDRESSES THAT TO. WHICH WE HAVE SEEN IN STUDIES FROM OTHER COUNTRIES SO. I JUST WANTED TO ADD THOSE COMMENTS AND THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. YES SIR. THE TROUBLE. SO THANK YOU FOR THOSE COMMENTS APRIL SHE THEM VERY MUCH AND I DO ONE AT A KNOWLEDGE YOUR EFFORT IN TRYING TO THINK CREATIVELY TO SOLVE AN ISSUE THAT IT IS AND I ACKNOWLEDGE VERY MUCH OF A REALITY OF WHAT WE HAVE- IN THAT AND I APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT IT'S A PILOT PROGRAM THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO IMPLEMENT IN ORDER TO GET MORE DATA AND MORE STUDIES ON. ON THE ISSUE- THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS THAT I DO APPRECIATE AND RESPECT IN THIS BILL I REALLY DO- IN MOST IN FROM THE EAST INTENT IN TRYING TO SOLVE AN ISSUE THAT IS VERY MUCH A- A HUGE PROBLEM FOR MANY FAMILIES AND MANY. COMMUNITY MEMBERS OUT LEGALLY AND ILLEGAL- MY APPROACH THOUGH OR MY CONCERN HOW IS A CONCERN I WOULD SAY WHAT IS A CONCERN IT IS AN APPROACH BUT- WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THE FACT THAT WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH TREATMENT CENTERS- IN. IN OUR STATE ARE IN THE COUNTRY TO TAKE CARE OF INDIVIDUALS FOR DEALING WITH ADDICTION- AND I AND I SPEAK THAT FROM. PERSONAL EXPERIENCE I REMEMBER. MEETING AT A YOUNG GENTLEMAN- I WAS HELPING HIM AND HE WAS TRYING TO GET INTO A FACILITY AND DID NOT HAVE ACCESS TAKE OUT THE FACILITIES IN OUR AREA WERE FULL- WHAT DO YOU SAY TO INDIVIDUALS WHO FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE. IN CREATING MORE TREATMENT CENTERS TO HELP PEOPLE- VERSUS CREATING. A PLACES TO. SAFELY USE TRUCKS. ON THANK YOU OPERATIVE BECAUSE I THINK WE'RE GONNA LOSE THE PHONE LINES AT SOME POINT- IT'S NOT MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE WE NEED MORE TREATMENT WE NEED TO DRAMATICALLY EXPAND ACCESS TO TREATMENT. THIS IS COMPLEMENTARY TO THAT THE GOAL HERE IS TO HELP TRANSITION PEOPLE INTO TREATMENT AS OF THE TWO GO HAND IN HAND- AND THAT'S WHY WE NEED BOTH IN MY VIEW. THANK YOU- ENOUGH FOR THE DESCRIPTION OF THE BETA SOON WHEN WE TALKED CLOSER RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU WE HAVE A TO PASS IN THIS BILL WILL BE REFERRED TO THE RE REFER TO THE FLOOR. CONSULTANT PLEASE CALL THE ROLL ON S. B. FIFTY SEVEN. SB FIFTY SEVEN BRADFORD BY FRED FRIED SHOBO NO NO TROUBLE NO CALM LONGER I HAVE A MARKER I SKINNER WIENER I WENT AWRY. THE ROLE OF THE MEASURE HAS FOUR VOTES WILL LEAVE THE ROLE OPEN FOR THE ABSENT MEMBER MEMBERS JUST TO LET YOU KNOW WE HAVE A HARD STOP AT TWELVE THIRTY WE STILL HAVE TWO MORE- MEASURES BEFORE US SO AN INTEREST OR TIME IF YOU CAN BE A LITTLE BIT MORE CONCISE WITH YOUR QUESTIONS OR STATEMENTS IT WOULD HELP US- MEET THAT DEADLINE OF TWELVE THIRTY- NEXT WE HAVE SB FIVE NINETEEN FIVE CENTER WINNER WHEN YOU'RE READY MISS WHEN YOU MAY BEGIN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN COLLEAGUES TODAY I'M PRESENTING SP FIVE NINETEEN WHICH WILL DECRIMINALIZE THE POSSESSION OF CERTAIN PSYCHEDELIC. DRUGS SOME OF THE SITE AND- SOME OF THE STOLEN. MDMA LSD ECONOMY AND- MASKELYNE AND IDLE GAMES FOR PEOPLE TWENTY ONE YEARS OR OLDER. SB FIVE NINETEEN DOES NOT AUTHORIZE DEDUCTION OR PERSONAL USE FOR ANYONE UNDER THE AGE OF TWENTY ONE AND ENSURES ACCOUNTABILITY. FOR ANYONE WHO GIVES PSYCHEDELICS TO MINORS. TO ENCOURAGE SAFER USE THE BILL ALSO DECRIMINALIZE DRUG TESTING KITS. AND PERMITS THE POSSESSION OF PARAPHERNALIA TO USING SUBSTANCES. AND ALSO EXPLAINED HIS CRIMINAL RECORDS FOR PEOPLE PART PREVIOUSLY CONVICTED OF POSSESSION AND PERSONAL USE. OF THESE SUBSTANCES. THE BILL WILL ALSO CREATE A WORKING GROUP TO PROVIDE RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE LEGISLATURE. ON HOW CALIFORNIA CAN REGULATE LEGAL ACCESS TO THESE SUBSTANCES- ARE GIVEN THEIR MEDICAL BENEFITS. FIFTY FIVE NINE IS A C. TOWARD THIS MAN THE FOR. AND RESET WAR ON- BECAUSE LUCKY PEOPLE FOR DRUG USE DOESN'T WORK- IN RECENT YEARS VARIOUS CITIES IN CALIFORNIA- AND OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY AND MOST RECENTLY OREGON HAVE DECRIMINALIZED PSYCHEDELICS- AND ALICE OREGON DID IT BY BALLOT MEASURE- OTHER COUNTRIES SUCH AS PORTUGAL HAVE DECRIMINALIZED DRUG USE AND POSSESSION- WE KNOW THAT- PSYCHEDELICS- OUR- CREW INCREASING NOTE THEY HAVE SIGNIFICANT. MEDICINAL BENEFITS PARTICULARLY AROUND MENTAL HEALTH AND ADDICTION SOME OF BEEN DEFINED BY THE FDA AS QUOTE BREAK THROUGH- DRUGS- AND SO THE WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS SAY LET'S NOT ARREST PEOPLE. FOR POSSESSING OR USING PSYCHEDELICS- LET'S ALLOW PEOPLE TO DO SO AND THEN LET'S TAKE STOCKS- IN TERMS OF HOW WE. MIGHT REGULATE- IN THE FUTURE. COLLEAGUES I RESPECT ASK YOUR I.

ABOUT THE PROVISIONS OF THE BILL. THAT AUTHORIZES ENABLES SOCIAL SHARING WHATEVER THAT PRECISELY MEANS- WHO YOU MAY REMEMBER IN THE MOST RECENT HEARING OF THE PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE- THERE WAS A BILL BY SENATOR MELENDEZ. IN WHICH THERE WERE OVER A HUNDRED WITNESSES. WHO HAD LOST A FAMILY MEMBER. THROUGH BASIC THROUGH SOCIAL SHARING THESE ARE NOT PEOPLE WHO HAD ADDICTIONS THESE WERE PEOPLE WHO- ASK FOR SOME KIND OF A DRUG COULD DEAL WHERE. SOME PARTICULAR ISSUE THEY WERE DEALING WITH HIM ON BE KNOWN TO THEM THERE WAS SHRAPNEL IN THE DRUGS CAN MAKE ALL RIGHT. READ OTHER COMMITTEE FOLLOW. PEOPLE FROM THE COMMUNITY CAN LOOK AT HER VERY YOUR SOLUTIONS IN THERE ARE A NUMBER OF SOLUTIONS TO DEAL WITH IT. WELL BUT WE ARE VERY VERY CONCERNED. ALL ABOUT ON MITIGATING SOCIAL SHARING WITHOUT SOME KIND OF OVERDOSE AND NO WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT PUTTING SOMEONE IN JAIL- BUT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT HAVING SOME KIND OF SAFETY SO THAT WE DON'T EVEN ABLE. FURTHER FOR CALYX BOB NO ONE CAN DOUBT READ THE FACTS OF THE ACTUAL BARRACKS PEOPLE CAN LOOK TO DIFFERENT REMEDIES BUT WE THINK BUT LEAVING. NO REMEDY- OR HAVING NO OVERSIGHT IS IT TRAGIC. MISTAKE THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS AN I WILL. THAT'S PRIMARY WITNESS NOW WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO WITH AND FORTY TWO OH THREE WHO ARE AND OPPOSITE OF S. B. FIVE NINE ARE THERE WITH ARE SOMEONE COME FOR PLAY. GOOD MORNING MY NAME TACK OUT I'M WITH THE INTERNET FAKE COLLEGE AS FOR AND THE CA EVERY EQUALITY I WAS ACTUALLY DO HERE TO SERVE AS THE SECONDARY PRIMARY WITNESS FOR THE OPPOSITION OF SB FIVE NINETEEN. GLORIA YEP TO MOUNT OKAY I'M- SB FIVE NINETEEN WHILE IT SEEMS INTENDED FOR GOOD SEEMS TO COME WITH A TON OF UNINTENDED HARMS WHILE STATING THAT IT'S DUE FOR HARM REDUCTION- IT'S WELL KNOWN THAT LOW INCOME AND IMPOVERISHED COMMUNITIES SUFFER THE GREATEST FROM DRUG EXPOSURE ABUSE AND ADDICTION IS ALSO WELL KNOWN THAT EXPOSURE COMES BY PRIMARY SOURCE AND THEN SECOND HAND USAGE IN MOST CASES- IT'S ALSO SCIENTIFICALLY PROVEN THAT PSYCHEDELICS OVER A TERM USE. TEND TO COST A SIDE EFFECT OF PERSISTENT PSYCHOSIS WHICH IS THE ACTUAL CONTRADICTORY EFFECT THEY WERE LOOKING FOR IN A MENTAL HEALTH CIRCUMSTANCE I'M COMING TO YOU NOT JUST AS A PRESIDENT OF A FAITH BASED COALITION WITHOUT THE DAUGHTER OF A FORMAL DRIP FROM REJECT ADDICT AND A PERSON WHO HAD TO GO THROUGH REHAB CIRCUMSTANCES AND I HAVE TO NOTATE. THAT THE BILL WHILE. THE WITH A THE RESPECT IN. THAT IT IS FOR- META USAGES ACTUALLY WRITTEN IN A WAY THAT IT. SERVES RECREATIONAL ESPECIALLY LEWIS TALKED SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THE SOCIAL SHARING ASPECT AND WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE IN A COMMUNITY. I REPRESENTED TO ME THAT ALSO SUFFERS THE LARGEST DISPROPORTIONATE INCARCERATION RATES AND THE DECRIMINALIZATION CARE GETS DANGLED IN FRONT OF US QUITE FREQUENTLY WHEN POOR POLICY GETS WRITTEN AND THEN THE POLICY COMES DOWN. AND WE SUFFERED THE LASTING LONG TERM EFFECTS OF IT SO IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE WE'RE LOOKING AT INCREASED ADDICTION MORE ACCESS TO DRUGEXPOSURE ARE ALSO LOOKING AT INCREASE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. WHERE INSTEAD OF THIS POLICY BEING CREATED A POLICY SHOULD HAVE BEEN CREATED OR POLICY SHOULD HAVE BEEN DESIGN IN THIS INSTANCE. TO ASSIST THESE COMMUNITIES WHO ALREADY SUFFER THESE THINGS EXCEPT FOR DECRIMINALIZING AND LETTING IT GO RAPID NO THE INTERNATIONAL FAITH BASED COALITION DOES NOT STAND TO REPRESENT THAT OUR PEOPLE SHOULD CONTINUE TO BE LOCKED UP. FOR THE USAGE OF SPECIFIC THREATS BUT WE ALSO REALIZE THAT THE APPROACH TO DRAG. REDUCTION IN HARM REDUCTION IS NOT MONOLITHIC AND SO MANY TIMES WE SEE THAT MONOLITHIC APPROACHES ARE BEING TAKEN. AND THEY SERVE AS A SURFACE LEVEL SOLUTION TO SOMETHING THAT IS COMPLETELY DEEPLY ROOTED IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE RUDY CRIMINALIZING THE USAGE OF PSYCHEDELICS ONE IN PARTICULAR THAT SERVES AS A DATE RAPE DRUG. IN A SOCIAL SHARING CIRCUMSTANCE WE CAN KIND OF SEE WHERE THAT CAN GO IN SOME INSTANCES. ON THE OTHER HAND OF THIS WE ALSO SEE THAT WE HAVE THE DECRIMINALIZATION OF SOMETHING THAT EVEN. YOU KNOW THE SENATE ARE PRESENTING IT HAS MADE A STATEMENT IS NOT REGULATED JUST YET THEY HAVE NO REGULATION TECHNIQUES. IN PLACE AS OF RIGHT NOW YOU DON'T LET A RABBIT DOG LOOSE AND THEN CHANGE IT AFTER IT'S BEEN SOMEBODY. THAT'S NOT HOW THAT GOES SO IF YOU'RE SAYING THAT THIS IS FOR MENTAL HEALTH CAPACITY. AT LEAST THE POLICY SHOULD CONVEY THAT THIS WOULD BE REGULATED OR OVERSEEN. BY MENTAL HEALTH AND THANK. THEIR ARE MET PER. IN OF PERPETUATE THE- YEAH. IS GOING TO BE SOMETHING THAT IS PERMISSIBLE. IT IS RECKLESS AT BEST AND FOR COMMUNITIES LIKE MINE THAT I COME FROM AS A CHILD OF A FORMER DRUG ADDICT. I'M A STATE AGAIN BUT IT IS COMPLETELY IRRESPONSIBLE OF US TO DEVELOP A POLICY THAT DOES NOT. GIVE US SOLUTIONS TO THE ISSUES THAT COMMUNITY ALREADY FACES THIS IS A BANDAID AND TYPICALLY WHEN YOU PUT A BANDAID ON A LARGE WOUND IT DOES NOT CLOSE. IT'S IN THE GETINFECTED AND UNFORTUNATELY THIS IS ONE OF THOSE TIMES WE'RE LOOKING AT A COMMUNITY LOOK. FACING YET ANOTHER INFECTION WITH NO TREATMENT OPTIONS BEING OFFERED.

I AM IN STRONG OPPOSITION TO THE SENATE BILL FIVE ONE NINE AS IT IS WRITTEN- SPECIFICALLY REGARDING ITS INCLUSION OF MASCULINE AND THE DISTANCE OF THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN MASCULINE AND PEYOTE IS VERY. SKEWED AND HARD TO DECIPHER- I AM URGING THE COMMITTEE FOR A NAY VOTE ON IT SENATE. BILL FIVE ONE NINE THANK YOU. YEAH MISTER SHARE THERE ARE NO PURCHASE Q. UP AT THE TIME.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND AGAIN A FINAL REMINDER PLEASE PRESS ONE FOLLOWED BY ZERO FOR IF YOU ARE IN OPPOSITION TO SB FIVE ONE NINE IF YOU WERE IN OPPOSITION ONLY TO SB. FIVE ONE NINE. AND MISTER KERR WE HAVE NOBODY ELSE QUEUING UP AT THIS POINT THANK YOU WE'LL BRING YOU BACK TO THE COMMITTEE AND THEIR QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS WHETHER COMMITTEE MEMBERS. YES OUR CENTER- TROUBLED. SO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- I LIKE TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD AND- I'VE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO MEET WITH SOME OF THE VETERANS- WHO ARE- IN A POSITION OF. USING THIS TYPE OF TREATMENT FOR THEIR DEPRESSION AND OUR STORIES WERE COMPELLING THEY WERE VERY I WAS VERY- I WAS HAPPY TO MEET THEM AND REALIZE THAT WE HAVE HOPE FOR MANY OF OUR VETERANS WERE SUFFERING FROM PTSD WITH REGARDS TO- TREATMENT- ALTERNATIVE TREATMENTS THAT YOU KNOW WHERE. THEY HAD TRIED I BELIEVE THEY WERE A HUNDRED AT. DIFFERENT TYPES OF TREATMENT THAT THEY WERE TRYING AND WAS A WORKING OR MEDICATIONS AND THEY FINALLY FOUND THE WAY TO DEAL WITH THAT WITH PTSD I THINK THAT THE EFFORT THERE- IS COMMENDABLE AND I AND I TRULY RESPECT THEIR- THEIR- THEIR DESIRE TO. CONTINUE IN THEIR HEALING PROCESS AND WILL TO SURVIVE- I'M ALSO ENCOURAGED TO SEE MANY OF THE STUDIES AND CLINICAL TRIALS AND BENEFITS OF THESE SPECIFIC DRUGS- HOWEVER THESE TRIALS WERE DONE UNDER THE DIRECTION AND CARE OF A MEDICAL PROFESSION PROFESSIONAL WITH THE DRUG IN AN ADULTERATED FORM AND WITH THE CORRECT DOSAGE WHICH WERE ALL THINGS THAT WE CANNOT GUARANTEE WITH BLANKET ORDERS CRIMINALIZATION AND- IN THIS BILL. TO THAT POINT I HAVE A QUESTION FOR YOU. I WOULD LIKE TO ASK IF YOU HAVE CONSIDERED STARTING TO ADDRESS THE LEGITIMATE MEDICAL USAGE FIRST. SIMILAR TO THE APPROACH THAT THE STATE TOOK WITH MEDICAL MARIJUANA. AND WAITING FOR THE RESULTS FROM THAT STUDY IN THIS BILL BEFORE FULLY DECRIMINALIZING ALL PERSONAL USAGE HERE AND- JUST TO BE CLEAR WITH MEDICAL CANNABIS WHEN VOTERS LEGALIZED. MEDICAL CANNABIS IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES IN CALIFORNIA. THAT THAT WAS NOT EVEN THOUGH YOU NEED A RECOMMENDATION FROM A PHYSICIAN FOR IT- IT DID NOT THE PRODUCT ITSELF IS NOT REGULATED IN TERMS OF ITS PURITY IT'S OUT OR WE DON'T GET THERE UNTIL TWENTY. TWENTY YEARS LATER WITH FULL LEGALIZATION- AND YOU KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE DERIVE ENORMOUS MEDICAL BENEFIT FROM THAT MEDICAL CANNABIS- IN TERMS OF HERE JUST TO BE CLEAR. ON ONE OF THE USES OF PSYCHEDELICS IS FOR MEDICINAL USE AND IT CAN BE VERY POWERFUL IN THERE ARE MANY STUDIES SHOWING THAT. ON RIGHT NOW BECAUSE PSYCHEDELICS- ARE WILL CONTINUE UNTIL THOSE CHANGES TO BE ILLEGAL. OTHER THAN WITH ONE EXCEPTION UNDER FEDERAL LAW- PHYSICIANS CANNOT BE INVOLVED THEY RISK. FEDERAL PROBLEMS WITH EIGHT IF THEY DO THAT SO SOME OF SAID WHY DON'T YOU REQUIRE SUPERVISION OF A PHYSICIAN- WE REALLY CAN'T DO THAT UNTIL THERE'S A CHANGE. IN FEDERAL LAW- AND SO ON WHAT WHAT WE ARE DOING IS SIMPLY DECRIMINALIZATION IT'S A FIRST STEP TO SAY WE'RE GONNA STOP ARRESTING PEOPLE. FOR POSSESSING OR USING- THESE SUBSTANCES- AND BECAUSE OF THAT IT TO WE RECORDED A DIFFERENTIATION BETWEEN MEDICAL USES AND OTHER USES. THAT WOULD BE REALLY YEAR HOW I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU WOULD EVEN DO THAT- IN A IN A DECRIMINALIZATION CONTACTS OF EX EXTREMELY HARD BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE THOSE BRIGHT LINES AROUND YOUR UNDER THE SUPERVISION. OF A PRESCRIPTION FROM A PHYSICIAN OR YOU DON'T- AND SO OUR APPROACH IS SAID LET'S TRY TO STOP ARRESTING PEOPLE FOR USING US FOR SETTING UP A TASK FORCE TO TALK ABOUT NEXT STEPS. AND WE HOPE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT COMES ALONG. OKAY HOW WOULD YOU ADDRESS THE CONCERNS THAT ARE UP WITH ONE OF THE- THE YOUNG LADY THAT SPOKE IN OPPOSITION A WITH REGARD TO HER COMMUNITY MEMBER AND NOT HAVING. THE SAFETY CARDS- AND HOW TO DEAL WITH THE- UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF THE CRIMINALIZING THESE TRUCKS- AND IDLE WHATEVER'S. EXPECT FOR THOSE COMMENTS AND- FOR THE YOU KNOW FOR THE JOURNEY AND THE CHALLENGES OF HER. OF HER I THINK SHE'S AT ONE OF OUR PARENTS- AND- DRUGS HAVE HAD HUGE IMPACTS IN IN VARIOUS. COMMUNITIES AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY WE'RE SEEING NOW THAT DRUGS ARE. YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF OPIOIDS IT'S EVERYWHERE- EVERY EVERY COMMUNITY EVERY- EVERY BACKGROUND EVERY ETHNICITY EVERY RACE- AND SO- IN TERMS OF. YOU KNOW GUARD WAS I JUST WANT TO BE REAL CLEAR- WEATHERED PSYCHEDELICS OR OTHER DRUGS. PEOPLE ARE USING THOSE DRUGS NOW AND HAVE BEEN FOR EVER I MEAN SOMETIMES AND WE HAD A LITTLE DIALOGUE ABOUT THIS BEFORE I CONCERNS AS A PERSPECTIVE. THAT IF YOU DECRIMINALIZE SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO BE AN INVITATION FOR PEOPLE TO USE. AND AS CENTER COM LONGER THINGS VERY ELOQUENTLY SAID BEFORE THAT IT'S JUST NOT. THE GUYS JUST NOT THE CASE- IF BANNING AND CRIMINALIZING DRUG POSSESSION. WORKED THEN WE WOULD BE AN NEVADA THERE'LL BE NO DRUG USE AT ALL IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. BECAUSE THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. ISN'T IT IF YOU IF YOU THINK CRIMINALIZATION OF DRUGS IS GOOD OF DRUG USE IS GOOD. THEN YOU WOULD YOU WOULD THINK THAT WERE THE ABSOLUTE BEST A PLUS COLD STARTS TO HIM BECAUSE- THE US HAS CRIMINALIZED DRUG USE- I MEAN JUST. IN AN EXTREME WAY. AND PEOPLE ARE STILL USING EVEN THAN THEY WERE. BEFORE AND SO BY THE CRIMINAL WE'RE NOT A INVITING PEOPLE TO USE. WERE TAKING INSTEAD OF A CRIMINAL APPROACH TO DRUG USE WE'RE TAKING A HEALTH APPROACH HELPING PEOPLE WHO NEED TO GET IN THE RECOVERY. ALLOWING PEOPLE TO USE SUBSTANCES ARE HELPFUL. TO THEM AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING. TO DO HERE SO IS THIS LIKE THE PERFECT GLOBAL SOLUTION TO EVERYTHING NOW I WOULD NEVER. STATE THAT WE NEED THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO START TAKING A MORE FORWARD LOOKING APPROACH. TO DRUGS IN GENERAL IN PARTICULAR AND TO PSYCHEDELICS SPECIFICALLY. BUT UNTIL THAT HAPPENS WHAT WE CAN DO AS CALIFORNIA IS TO STOP ARRESTING AND LOCKING PEOPLE UP FOR POSSESSING. AND USING THESE DRUGS. SO IN ORDER FOR SENATE JUST RIGHT SO I CAN UNDERSTAND. IN ORDER FOR THIS TO BE. ADAM IN ORDER FOR THIS TO BE IMPLEMENTED IN A IN A MEDICAL ENVIRONMENT WE HAVE TO DECRIMINALIZE IT FIRST ON THE FEDERAL LEVEL IS THAT CORRECT WOULD HAVE TO HAPPEN- IS THEY WOULD HAVE TO BE RESCHEDULING. OF THE DRUGS AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL AND I THINK OF THE DRUGS THAT WE INCLUDE YOUR ONLY ONE ACADEMY IN- A DOCTOR CAN PRESCRIBE ECONOMY BUT THAT'S THE ONLY ONE AND SO WE WOULD NEED TO HAVE FEDERAL RESCHEDULING OF MORE DRUGS INTO ONE PROVISION IN THIS BILL. IS THAT IF AND WHEN THERE IS FEDERAL RESCHEDULING A PARTICULAR SUBSTANCES CALIFORNIA WILL AUTOMATICALLY RESCHEDULE AS WELL AND AT THAT POINT- DOCTORS WOULD BE ABLE TO BE INVOLVED BUT WE'RE NOT THERE YET. OKAY AND THERE WAS A THERE WAS A COMMENT SOME. MAYBE WAS THE- I'M NOT SURE WHO MENTIONED THE FACT THAT ONE OF THE DRUGS THAT WERE. INCLUDED IN THIS WAS- SOME FORM OR LEVEL OF FENTANYL IS THAT. THAT I CAN'T CHATTER WAS OUT COMPLETELY. THERE'S A WRONG DID I MISUNDERSTAND ABSOLUTELY NOT IS NOT INCLUDED AS PART OF THOSE- YOU KNOW I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD BE ADDRESSING ARE PUTTING PEOPLE IN JAIL FOR USING PENCIL EITHER THAT'S A MAJOR HEALTH ISSUE. AND WE WANT TO HELP PEOPLE IT'S A SEPARATE ISSUE FROM WHAT'S BEFORE US TODAY- NO- AND SENT ALL THE LEASING A SENTINEL WHICH WE HEARD ABOUT WOULD CENTER MELENDEZ IS BILL WITH. OFFICE PERCOCET CENTEL'S ETCETERA- THAT'S NOT REALLY TO MY KNOWLEDGE A REAL ISSUE WITH WITH PSYCHEDELIC SO I CAN'T SAY IT'S NEVER HAPPENED BUT I THINK YOU'RE NOT IT'S NOT TYPICAL AT ALL TO SEE LACING OF PSYCHEDELICS- WITH- WITH RENTAL. AND HOW DO YOU RESPOND TO THE DRUG THAT- IS. USED DURING DAY OR DATE. THE THERE IS THERE A DRUG THAT WE X. FOR NEXT YEAR. WHICH IS LIKE A- WHAT WE THINK OF AS THE DATE RAPE. ROG I THINK SHE WAS REFERRING TO CADMIUM IF I'M NOT- MISTAKEN- AND I CAN KIND OF MEAN IS ALREADY SCHEDULED SO PHYSICIAN. CAN PRESCRIBE AND SO- YOU KNOW WE DID KEEP GHB OUT OF THE OUT OF THE BILL. TIME AND WHEN WE THINK OF. THE DATE RAPE DRUG STOCKS LIKE THE- BURKE BUT THE CULPRIT IN CHIEF SERVICE SPEAKING WE TALK ON BUT IT'S NOT INCLUDED IN THIS BILL. AND THEN MY LAST QUESTION I THINK WOULD BE- WITH REGARDS TO IN YOUR- IN YOUR MIND HOW DO WE- HOW DO WE RECIPROCATE THE EIGHT THE NOTION OF IT I KNOW. WE CAN TALK ABOUT MEDICAL. CANNABIS OR MARIJUANA BUT- THE FACT THAT IF YOU DECRIMINALIZE IT HERE WE STILL DON'T HAVE IT AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. THAT'S WHERE WE ARE TODAY WITH WITH CANNABIS IN CALIFORNIA- FOR ALMOST TWENTY FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS I THINK IT'S ABOUT TWENTY FIFTH ANNIVERSARY WE HAVE DID YOU KNOW FIRST MEDICAL AND THEN IT'LL BUT DON'T USE- AND- WE'VE AND SO IF A BUNCH OF STATES I THINK 40% OF THE US POPULATION NOW LIVES IN THE STATE. OF NEW YORK AND SOME OTHER- SEDUCTIONS WHERE IT'S LEGAL TO USE CANNABIS- AND CONGRESS HASN'T CAUGHT UP IN WHAT I DON'T GET ME STARTED ON THE LAUNDRY LIST. OF ISSUES WERE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S WAY BEHIND THE STATE'S- BUT AS US AS JUSTICE LOUIS BRANDEIS ONCE SAID THE STATES ARE THE LABORATORIES WE TRY THINGS OUT AND THEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ALTERNATELY COMES. ALONG SO IT WORKED OUT OKAY WITH CANNABIS I'M NOT SAYING FROM PERFECT HAVE BEEN SOME MOMENTS IN TIME WHERE THERE'S BEEN TENSION BUT ULTIMATELY WE HAVE A WHOLE ROBUST SYSTEM OF CANNABIS. IN THE STATE AND IT'S WORKING OKAY THE CULTIVATION THE SALE OF THE USE THAT CETERA. ON SO I KNOW THAT WE CAN DO IT. OKAY SO JUST FOR THE RECORD CENTER WIENER AYE APPRECIATE THE EFFORTS AND I UNDERSTAND AND RESPECT THE EFFORTS IN. THESE THAT THIS BILL IS INTENDED ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO SAVING THE LIVES OUR VETERANS AND OUR- I'M SURE OUR PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICERS AS WELL- I WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THIS BILL RIGHT NOW BUT I TRULY DO LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU- INCOMING. PERHAPS IN A WAY THAT WOULD BE ABLE TO MEET THE CONCERNS OF MY COMMUNITY MY DISTRICT- BUT I DO COMMEND YOU FOR THE WORK THAT YOU'RE DOING HERE AND TRYING TO THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX IN IN DEALING WITH BEHAVIOR HEALTH AND SAVING OUR VETERANS I TRULY TRULY APPRECIATE YOUR EFFORT IN THAT ENDEAVOR. THANK YOU THANK YOU ANSWER FROM MY TO SAY I KNOW YOU TAKING QUITE A BIT OF TIME ON THIS BILL AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT. THANK YOU. ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS FOR THE- I WOULD SAY I THINK MISS SKINNER MENTION FENTANYL IN RELATIONSHIP TO THE LAST BILL. THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN IT FOR. THERE WERE NO WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE OUR COLORS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. YOU CAN CHOOSE MEMBERS WE- A TO PASS TO THIS COMMITTEE ON. HEALTH EARN WE WERE LOOKING FOR THE MOTION ON THIS MEASURE. CENTER CAMARGO HAS MOVED THE S. P. FIVE ONE NINE CONSULTANT PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. SB FIVE ONE NINE SENATOR BRADFORD. ALL RIGHT BRADFORD AYE IT TO A VOTE NOW TROUBLE NO CALM WATER I FAMILIARIZE SKINNER WIENER RIGHT GENERAC. OUR MEMBERS WILL LEAVE THE- I AM OPEN FOR OUR OUR APPS TO MEMBER WE CURRENTLY AT THREE TO WARN. THREE HOURS NO ONE ON ONE NO MOVIE DROVE LAST MEASURE SB SEVEN TEN. FINE SENATOR BRADFORD TO. HOPEFULLY AS A STEP IN ORDER TO GO AND. IF I MAY I WILL PRESENT FROM RIGHT HERE TO SAVE SOME TIME WITH. THANK YOU SENATOR BRADFORD YOU MAY PRESENT YOUR BILL. SB SEVEN TEN THANK YOU. SB SIX SEVEN TEN IS JUST REPORT MEASURE THAT WOULD ADDRESS WHAT IS CLEARLY A CONFLICT OF INTEREST THAT. EXISTS BETWEEN PROSECUTORS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS WHO HAVE COMMITTED MISCONDUCT WHILE ON DUTY THIS BILL REQUIRED TO SECURE TURNING WHO HAS RECEIVED A MONETARY BENEFIT FROM AN ASSOCIATION THAT SOLELY REPRESENTS LAW ENFORCEMENT TO RECUSE HIMSELF. FROM THE INVESTIGATION CHARGING AND THE PROSECUTION OF OFFICERS THAT IS A MEMBER OF THAT ASSOCIATION- THIS BILL ONLY APPLIES IF THAT ASSOCIATION ALSO PROVIDES REPRESENTATION FOR THE OFFICERS. IN THE CRIMINAL CASE. AFTER RECUSING THEMSELVES THE ATTORNEY GENERAL WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR- PROSECUTE THE CASE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL FOR HIMSELF WITH COMP. THEN THE SPONSOR PROSECUTOR WILL BE A SIGN. BOTH STATE LAW AND THE STATE BAR. MARCH OF PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT ADDRESS HOW ATTORNEYS SHOULD RESPOND WHEN FACED WITH A CONFLICT OF INTEREST BUT THEY ARE UNCLEAR WITH THE SPECIFIC TYPE OF SITUATIONS. PROSECUTORS ARE SOME OF THE MOST POWERFUL ACTORS AND OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM AND THEIR ROLE IS UNIQUE AND UNLIKE ANY OTHER ELECTED OFFICIALS THEY CAN DETERMINE ONCE. FUTURE AS IT RELATES TO CRIMINAL PROSECUTION AND CONVICTION THEIR DUTY- IS TO FAIRLY AND IMPARTIALLY ENFORCE A LAW NOT SIMPLY MAKE POLICY CHOICES WHICH WE FIND OURSELVES IN MANY TIMES. FOR ALL THE TIMES ISSUE SIR DISTRICT ATTORNEY HOLD A FUNDAMENTAL ROLE- IN. HOLDING BAD OFFICERS ACCOUNTABLE YET POLICE OFFICERS IN THE STATE- SERIOUSLY HARM KILL PEOPLE ON A REGULAR BASIS AND VERY RARELY IF EVER ARE CHARGED LET ALONE PROSECUTED AND- BY TWENTY ONE TALK ABOUT THE NUMBER OF CONVICTIONS THAT WE FIND IN THAT AREA. AS A RESULT OUR COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE- AND RIGHTFULLY SO- HAVE GREAT DISTRUST WITH OUR DISTRICT ATTORNEYS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT IN THE SEARCHERS RELATIONSHIP THAT EXISTS BETWEEN THE TWO- SUPPOSED TO WIN AGAIN THOSE ASSOCIATIONS DONATE TO THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S AND IN FINANCING. THE COUNCIL- FOR THE BAD OFFICERS OFFICERS. THIS IS A CLEAR ETHICAL ISSUE AND OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM WILL BE A GREAT BENEFIT BY ADDRESSING THIS CONFLICT OF INTEREST. BY THIS BILL THERE'S NO PREVENT ANY FROM RECEIVING A FAIR AND IMPARTIAL TRIAL THIS BILL DOES NOT PREVENT LAW ENFORCEMENT UNIONS FROM DONATING TO THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY CANDACE NOR DOES IT FOR BED. DISTRICT ATTORNEY FROM ACCEPTING THOSE CONTRIBUTIONS IT ONLY REQUIRES THOSE ATTORNEYS TO RECUSE THEMSELVES. FROM THEIR CRIMINAL CASE REMOVING ANY OPPORTUNITY OF A BIAS IN- FAVORITISM WE HAVE TO DO THAT AS LOCAL STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTED OFFICIALS ALL THE TIME THERE IS A FINANCIAL BROKER CONFLICT ANYTHING THAT WE'RE DOING. TODAY TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT OF THIS IS DA- DIANA BECTON FROM- CONSEQUENCE TO. CONTRA COSTA COUNTY. DISTRICT ATTORNEY OF SOME SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY- TORY BERBERS CELLS ARE ABLE TO MORE MEMBERS OF THE PRO PROSECUTORS ALLIANCE FOR CALIFORNIA AND THE SPONSORS OF THIS BILL. AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. I'M SORRY I FAILED TO RECOGNIZE THAT I HAVE YOUR GAVEL- WILL NOW MOVE ON TO YOUR LEAD WITNESS- AND WE HAVE. DIANA BECTON AND TORY- PRAYER SALAZAR DIANA BECTON WOULD YOU LIKE TO- TO MAKE YOUR STATEMENT. YES THANK YOU- GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND THANK YOU TO THE CHAIR FOR CARRYING- THIS BILL MY NAME IS ZAINAB ECONOMIC FOUNDING MEMBER OF THE PROSECUTORS ALLIANCE OF CALIFORNIA AND WE ARE PROUD TO SPONSOR SB SEVEN TEN I AM THE ELECTED DISTRICT ATTORNEY OF CONTRA COSTA COUNTY. PRIOR TO BECOMING DISTRICT ATTORNEY AND SERVED FOR TWENTY TWO YEARS AT THE CONTRA COSTA COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT JUDGE HI I HAVE DEDICATED MY PROFESSIONAL LIFE TO ENSURING THAT THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM PROVIDES FAIR AND EQUAL ACCESS TO TALK. BUT THE SYSTEM DOESN'T. CHUNKS EFFECTIVELY THE PUMP DOES NOT TRUSTED AND HAVE FAITH IN ITS IMPARTIALITY. THE NATIONWIDE DEMONSTRATIONS OVER THE DEATH OF GEORGE COOLEY PRETTY ON THE TAYLOR AND COUNTLESS OTHERS. HAVE MADE IT CLEAR THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT FACES A CRISIS OF LEGITIMACY. IT'S NOT JUST THE POLICE IT'S ALSO THE PROSECUTORS AND THE COURT STRUCK FAILING TO HOLD THE POLICE ACCOUNTABLE WHEN THEY BREAK THE LAW. WHEN PEOPLE AND BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES FIGURE ABOUT ONE. HELD OFF TO JAIL FOR MINOR OFFENSES BUT WATCH POLICE OFFICERS KILLED MEMBERS OF THEIR COMMUNITIES WITHOUT FACING ANY CRIMINAL CONSEQUENCES. IT'S NOT SURPRISING THAT PEOPLE CONCLUDE THAT THE SYSTEM IS RIGGED AGAINST THEM. SB SEVEN TEN WILL ADDRESS ONE ALL TOO COMMON PRACTICE THAT CONTRIBUTE TO THIS PERCEPTION.

WONDERFUL GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS TORY REBELS ARE NINE ACCOUNTING MEMBER OF THE PROSECUTORS ALLIANCE OF CALIFORNIA AND A PROUD SPONSOR OF SB SEVEN TEN BY SENATOR RAPPER. I HAVE BEEN A MEMBER OF THE OFFICE FOR MORE THAN THIRTY YEARS AND IT SERVED AS A DISTRICT ATTORNEY OF SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY SINCE TWENTY FIFTEEN. I ECHO THE SENATOR'S NDA BECKONED COMMENTS ON THE NEED FOR THIS BILL AND WITH MY TESTIMONY WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE ARGUMENTS WE'VE HEARD IN OPPOSITION. THIS BILL NEARLY TAILOR TO A MAN I CAN STATE INTEREST ENSURING THE INTEGRITY OF OUR JUDICIAL SYSTEM AND FAIR TREATMENT FOR ALL VICTIMS AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS WHICH IS OUR NUMBER ONE PRIORITY. THE OPPOSITION CLAIMS THAT WE ARE INFRINGING. ON THEIR FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHT TO ENGAGE IN POLITICAL SPEECH. TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE CAMPAIGN OF A DISTRICT DISTRICT ATTORNEY CANDIDATE OF THEIR CHOICE. SB SEVEN TEN DOES NOT LIMIT THE ABILITY OF LAW ENFORCEMENT SITUATIONS TO CONTRIBUTE TO CANDIDATES. FOR PROSECUTOR OFFICES. DA CANDIDATE TO ACCEPT THE COUNTRY. THE BILL MERELY PROVIDES THAT IN CASES INVOLVING ALLEGED CRIMINAL CONDUCT BY ON DUTY PEACE OFFICERS. THE DHR HOUSTON'S FELL FROM THE INVESTIGATION AND PROSECUTION IF THE LAW ENFORCEMENT ASSOCIATION ALSO PROVIDES REPRESENTATION TO THE OPS DURING THE CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION. CONGRESSMAN BE MET. THIS GAVE A MONETARY TO DA DURING THE INVEST. AND THE ASSOCIATION IS PROVIDING REPRESENTATION TO THE AFTER BEING INVESTIGATED AND THE REMEDY IS SIMPLY REFUSAL OF THE DNA. TO ADVANCE A COMPELLING STATE INTEREST MAINTAINING PUBLIC CONFIDENCE IN THE INTEGRITY OF PROSECUTORS AND THEIR INVESTIGATION POLICE WRONGDOING. THE ACTOR PROSECUTORS CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT POSITION AND EXCELLING TO HOLD ACCOUNTABLE MEMBERS OF THE SAME ASSOCIATION. FOR SEEMINGLY CRIMINAL ACTS CORRODES PUBLIC TRUST IN AN INSTITUTION LEGITIMACY HINGES ON THE PUBLIC SPACE IN ITS FAIRNESS IMPARTIALITY. FINALLY THE OPPOSITION ALSO POINTS OUT THAT MEMBERS OF LEGISLATIVE BODIES DO NOT HAVE TO RECUSE THEMSELVES FROM VOTING ON ISSUES RELATED TO AND INDEED. THAT HAD DONATED TO THEIR CAMPAIGNS. BUT PROSECUTORS SERVE A PUBLIC DUTY DISTINCT FROM OTHER POLITICIANS. WEIRD MINISTRY YEARS OF JUSTICE NOT CRAFTERS A POLICY WE MUST HOLD ANYONE WHO BREAKS THE LAW ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR ACTIONS EVEN IF THEY ARE FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT. IT IS OF PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE FOR THE PUBLIC TRUST US TO CARRY OUT THOSE DUTIES FAIRLY AND IMPARTIALLY. SB. SEVEN TEN IS CRITICAL TO BUILDING THAT TRUST. THANK YOU IN ADVANCE FOR YOUR VOTED BY.

I AM. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WOULD YOU LIKE TO PROCEED PLEASE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS LARRY MORSE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION AND RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION TO SENATE BILL SEVEN TEN. L. SINGLED OUT DISTRICT ATTORNEYS AMONG ALL ELECTED OFFICIALS AS BEING INCAPABLE OF RECONCILING THEIR ETHICAL DUTIES WITH HAVING RECEIVED POLITICAL SUPPORT IN THIS CASE FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT ORGANIZATIONS. WHY WOULD BE AS BE HELD TO A DIFFERENT STANDARD THAN MEMBERS OF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE MANY OF WHOM ROUTINELY SOLICIT SIGNIFICANT CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS FROM A VAST ARRAY OF SPECIAL INTERESTS WHO HAVE BUSINESS IN THE LEGISLATURE. WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN AN ELECTED DA RECEIVING THE FINANCIAL SUPPORT OF A LAW ENFORCEMENT UNION IN HIS OR HER COUNTY AND THEN FAIRLY AND ETHICALLY ASSESSING A SUBSEQUENT BOB CERTAIN BALL SHOOTING CASE. AND A MEMBER OF THE LEGISLATURE ACCEPTING CONTRIBUTIONS THROUGHOUT HER OR HIS CAREER FROM SAY UTILITY INTERESTS AND THEN VOTING ON LEGISLATION REGULATING THOSE SAME UTILITY. PRACTICALLY SPEAKING NOT. WE WOULD NOT SUGGEST THAT JUST BECAUSE A MEMBER OF THE LEGISLATURE HAS TAKEN CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS FROM SPECIAL INTERESTS HERE SHE IS RENDERED INCAPABLE OF VOTING YES OR HER CONSCIENCE ON THE BILL AFFECTING NOT SPECIAL INTERESTS YET THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT THIS BILL TELLS ELECTED DISTRICT ATTORNEY. WHY IS THE BILL SINGLE OUT ONLY LAW ENFORCEMENT CONTRIBUTIONS THE SPONSORS OF THIS BILL HAVE BEEN ACTIVELY SUPPORTED BY DEFENSE MARKETERS BUT THE BILL DOES NOT PROHIBIT THEM FROM INVESTIGATING OR PROSECUTING AN OFFICER INVOLVED SHOOTING OVER THOSE SAME MEMBERS OF THE DEFENSE BAR HAVE A KEEN INTEREST IN WHETHER CHARGES WERE FILED. THIS WOULD SEEM TO BE IN THE GREAT JUST DOUBLE STANDARD AND FAST AS WE READ THE BILL IF THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY DID NOT RECEIVE POLITICAL CONTRIBUTIONS FROM A LOCAL PEACE OFFICERS ASSOCIATION OR DEPUTY SHERIFF'S ASSOCIATION BUT DID RECEIVE A CONTRIBUTION OR ACCESS STATEWIDE ASSOCIATION WHICH HAS MEMBERS OF BOTH THE LOCAL SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT AND LOCAL POLICE AGENCIES. THE DA WILL BE DEEMED TO HAVE A CONFLICT. OF INTEREST. PUT IT CONDUCTING BY SHOOTING INVESTING. IN ANY AGENCY THAT HAS OR ARE MEMBERS. UNDER THIS WHEN I OFFICER INVOLVED THE- A DIEGO BECOME TO IF OR HER. CONTRA TO THE WHAT IF ANY POLICE ASSOCIATIONS SUPPORTED HIS OR HER CANDIDACY AND IF THAT OFFICER WAS A MEMBER OF ANY OF. THE BILL IF APPROVED WOULD BE GUARANTEED THIS DRAMATICALLY INCREASE THE NUMBER OF OFFICER INVOLVED SHOOTING CASES THAT THE AG WILL SOON BE INVESTIGATING UNDER LAST YEAR'S AB FIFTEEN OH SIX. MOREOVER YOU ALMOST CERTAINLY HAVE SITUATIONS IN BOTH IN WHICH BOTH THE AG AND A LOCAL VA. RECEIVED CONTRIBUTIONS FROM PORAC- OTHER STATEWIDE LAW ENFORCEMENT ASSOCIATIONS. SUCH CASES CA WILL NOT BE ABLE TO CONDUCT THE L. I. S. INVESTIGATION NOR WILL THE ATTORNEY GENERAL WHO WILL THEN BE COMPELLED TO RETAIN A SPECIAL PROSECUTOR. TO CONDUCT THE INVESTIGATION. MISTER ATTORNEY DOESN'T WANT TO A CONTRA FROM SAFE ORGAN. AND HERE SHE CAN DECLINE BUT AS WOULD MEMBERS OF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE DISTRICT ATTORNEYS STRENUOUSLY OBJECT TO THE IMPLICATION THAT THEY CANNOT DESTROYERS ARE ELECTED DUTIES FAITHFULLY AND WITHOUT FEAR OR FAVOUR NO MATTER WHO HAS SUPPORTED THEIR CAMPAIGN FOR OFFICE. WE BELIEVE THIS BILL CREATES SIGNIFICANT CONSTITUTIONAL CHALLENGES AS WELL IN THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT CASES WOODLAND HILLS RESIDENTS ASSOCIATION ENFORCES CITY COUNCIL OF LOS ANGELES THE COURT NOTED THAT QUOTE. A LITTLE CONTRIBUTIONS INVOLVE EXERCISE OF FUNDAMENTAL FREEDOMS PROTECTED BY THE FIRST AMENDMENT TO THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION AND ARTICLE ONE pCONSTITUTION. IN THE WOODLAND HILLS CASE THE COURT REJECTED THE IDEA THAT ALEXIS CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS MUST BE RECUSED FROM VOTING ON THE DEVELOPMENT ISSUE. BECAUSE DEVELOPERS THAT DONATED TO THE COUNCIL MEMBERS CAMPAIGNS. IN REJECTING THIS CLAIM THE COURT SAID QUOTE DISQUALIFIER CITY COUNCIL MEMBER FROM ACTING ON THE DEVELOPMENT PROPOSAL BECAUSE THE DEVELOPER HAD MADE A CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTION ABOUT NUMBER WOULD THREATEN CONSTITUTIONALLY PROTECTED POLITICAL SPEECH AND ASSOCIATION FREEDOMS. END QUOTE WE SUPPORT THE TRANSPARENT AS- TRANSPARENCY AND REPORTING ALL CONTRIBUTIONS TO ELECTED OFFICIALS INCLUDING THE H. M. BELIEVE THE VOTERS DECIDE FOR THEMSELVES HAVE TO ASK JUST. AS THEY WOULD MEMBERS OF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE YEAH CANCEL ANYTIME AND IT MAXIMUM WHETHER. ANY OF. ARE TIED TO THOSE KIND OF. THIS BILL IS DANE ARBITRARY INCOME. AND LIGHTING ON KERR. AND WE WERE ASK BIRD- BOTH THANK. THANK YOU MISTER MORRIS FOR YOUR FREE TESTIMONY WOULD LIKE TO NOW MOVE TO ANY WITNESSES HERE IN ROOM FORTY TWO- THREE. ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES IN ROOM TWENTY FORTY WHO WAS TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION OF SB SEVEN TEN.

THANK YOU MODERATOR IF YOU WOULD PLEASE GIVE ME THE TOTAL NUMBER OF WAITING AT PEOPLE WAITING TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION PLEASE. WE HAVE NOBODY CUTE OUT. THANK YOU MODERATOR IF YOU WOULD PLEASE- CHECK THE LINE ONCE AGAIN TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE HEARD FROM ALL OPPOSITION WITNESSES.

THANK YOU MODERATOR- THANK YOU TO ALL OF OUR SUPPORT IN OPPOSITION WITNESSES SO WE WILL NOW BRING THE DISCUSSION BACK TO THE TO THE MEMBERS TO ANY OF OUR MEMBERS HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS AT THIS TIME. SEEN ON. SENATOR I BROUGHT FOR WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU I'M SURE AND I'M GOING TO THANK THE WITNESSES WHO ARE SPOKE IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE BUT I ALSO WANT TO THANK THE WITNESSES SPOKE IN OPPOSITION BECAUSE I THINK- HISTORY HAS PROVEN THAT- THAT THERE. IS A CLEAR NEED FOR THIS MEASURE- WE WOULD LIKE TO BELIEVE THAT- JUSTICE IS BLIND- BUT IT'S NOT. AND HISTORY HAS PROVEN THAT THERE IS AN INCESTUOUS RELATIONSHIP THAT HAS EXISTED BETWEEN. LAW ENFORCEMENT AND DH SINCE THE BEGINNING OF TIME. MANY OF THOSE INVESTIGATORS WHO WORK FOR THE DA ARE FORMER POLICE OFFICERS. MANY OF WHOM ARE FROM- FORMER MEMBERS OF THE UNION TO PROVIDE US. AND TO SAY THAT A CONFLICT OF INTEREST IS DIFFERENT OUR OUR SHOULD BE VIEWED AS THE SAME FOR STATE LEGISLATOR VERSES EIGHT DA IS. FAR FROM ACCURATE. WE HAVE A GREAT RESPONSIBILITY AS LEGISLATOR TO BE ON A LOCAL STATE OR FEDERAL LEVEL TO SHAKE LAW. BUT DA'S HAVE THE RIVER- THE UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY. TO AFFECT ONE'S LIFE FROM CRIMINAL STANDPOINT- FROM THE BILLY TO CHARGE AN INDIVIDUAL TO PROSECUTE INDIVIDUAL AND TO SENTENCE SOMEONE. TO LONG TERMS IN PRISON AND WE AS LEGISLATORS TO NOT HAVE THAT AUTHORITY. IT HAS ALSO BEEN PROVEN TO VOTERS INDIVIDUALS BOTH JUDGES. THAT I'VE TALKED TO ALONG THE WAY ONE WHICH WHO RESIGNED FROM THE BENCH BECAUSE OF THE SEARCHERS RELATIONSHIP HAT EXISTED BETWEEN. D. A.'S ON LAW ENFORCEMENT WORK HE COULD VERY RARELY EVER SEE. A CHARGE EVER BEING FOLLOWED BY A POLICE OFFICER WHO HAD UNJUSTLY USE FORCE OR KILLED SOMEONE. OR TAMPERED WITH EVIDENCE OR- BOB USED HE SHE'S. WHILE ON DUTY- TO VERY WERE- EVERY CHARGE LET PROSECUTING CONVICT. CASE IN POINT OVER THIRTEEN HUNDRED POLICE SHOOTINGS HAVE HAPPENED OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS DURING THAT PERIOD OF TIME. LESS THAN TEN WERE PROSECUTED AND ONLY ONE CONVICTED I DON'T CARE WHAT PROFESSION YOU AND NO ONE GETS IT RIGHT THAT MANY TIMES AND TO SAY THAT. ONLY TEN FOR FOLKS WERE WORTHY OF BEING PROSECUTED CLEARLY SPEAKS VOLUMES TO THE NEED. FOR THIS MEASURE AGAIN A PROVIDES BETTER GOVERNMENT IT PROVIDES TRANSPARENCY IT AND PROTECTS. US CITIZENS AND RESTORES CONFIDENCE THAT NO LONGER EXIST HERE. AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR OUR VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR WE HAVE A MOTION BY SENATOR WIENER TO MOVE THE BILL. THE MOTION.
