THAN WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN

00:08:33.279 --> 00:08:34.780
PREDICTED BECAUSE OF THE FIRST

NOT WITHSTANDING THIS IMPROVED

00:09:32.338 --> 00:09:34.473
FISCAL POSITION AS THE GOVERNOR

HIGHLIGHTED IN HIS INITIAL

00:09:36.108 --> 00:09:37.743
PROPOSAL WHICH WE WILL AGAIN

00:09:37.810 --> 00:09:40.613
HERE TODAY. THE RECOVERY IS ALL

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:44.050

00:09:44.116 --> 00:09:48.187

00:09:48.254 --> 00:09:49.956
INEQUALITIES IN OUR STATE

00:09:50.022 --> 00:09:51.390
INCREASING THE NUMBER OF

FAMILIES AND INDIVIDUALS WHO

00:09:53.392 --> 00:09:55.394

ECONOMICALLY. SO AS WE-

ALSO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE A

00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:30.062

WITH UPDATED CALCULATIONS.

00:16:37.663 --> 00:16:38.797
THIRTY INCREASE REVENUES ARE

00:16:38.864 --> 00:16:41.233
DUE LARGELY TO THREE FACTORS AS

00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:42.968
THE CHAIR STATE AND- THE LESS

00:16:43.035 --> 00:16:45.604
SEVERE DOWNTURN IF IT IS A LOT

00:16:45.671 --> 00:16:46.538
OF THEIR DOWNTURN. LARGELY

00:16:46.605 --> 00:16:48.807
INTACT- BECAUSE OF FEDERAL

00:16:48.874 --> 00:16:50.175
STIMULUS THAT WAS PROVIDED

00:16:50.242 --> 00:16:52.811
EARLY LAST YEAR- ALSO THERE WAS

00:16:52.878 --> 00:16:54.613
A SIGNIFICANT ON EQUAL SPREAD

00:16:56.448 --> 00:16:58.350
WHERE YOU SAW A LOT OF HIGHER

00:17:00.386 --> 00:17:02.388
PASS THAT AND MOVE TO TELEWORK.

00:17:02.454 --> 00:17:03.389
AND LOWER INCOME WORKERS WERE

00:17:03.455 --> 00:17:05.858
NOT THE HIGHER WAGE WORKERS- IN

00:17:05.924 --> 00:17:07.526
OUR STATE PAY MORE IN TAXES

00:17:07.593 --> 00:17:08.794

HANDOUT. AND HERE YES WE

00:33:54.065 --> 00:33:55.800
CALCULATE THAT THE GOVERNOR'S

00:33:55.867 --> 00:33:57.402
BUDGET REFLECTS ABOUT A FIFTEEN

00:33:57.468 --> 00:33:59.370
AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS ONE

00:33:59.437 --> 00:34:02.373
TIME SURPLUS. WHILE THIS IS

00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:04.776
QUITE LARGE IT IS NOTICEABLY

00:34:04.842 --> 00:34:06.477
DOWN FROM THE TWENTY SIX

00:34:06.544 --> 00:34:09.447
BILLION DOLLAR. WINDFALL THAT

00:34:09.514 --> 00:34:12.417
ARE NOVEMBER FISCAL OUTLOOK

00:34:12.483 --> 00:34:14.051
IDENTIFIED WERE ESTIMATED. WE

00:34:14.118 --> 00:34:16.687
REFERRED TO IT AS A WINDFALL I

00:34:16.754 --> 00:34:18.322
KNOW THIS IS BANNED THERE'S

00:34:18.389 --> 00:34:19.524
SOME DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT TO

00:34:19.590 --> 00:34:21.726
CALL IT WE DID REFER TO IT AS A

00:34:21.793 --> 00:34:24.429
WINDFALL. WE THOUGHT THAT HELPS

00:34:24.495 --> 00:34:26.764
EMPHASIZE THE ONE TIME NATURE

00:34:26.831 --> 00:34:29.000
OF THE SURPLUS AND ALSO IT'S

00:34:29.067 --> 00:34:30.835
SORT OF CONVEYS THE SENSE THAT

00:34:30.902 --> 00:34:32.837
IT'S MORE A FUNCTION OF

00:34:32.904 --> 00:34:35.807
REVENUES. NOT CLIMB JEAN IN THE

00:34:35.873 --> 00:34:37.175
WAY THAT THE TWENTY TWENTY

00:34:37.241 --> 00:34:39.043
BUDGET ACT THIS YEAR AND- MORE

00:34:39.110 --> 00:34:41.446
THAN IT DOES ANY KIND OF- YOU

00:34:41.512 --> 00:34:43.214
KNOW SEARCH ABOUT THE HISTORIC

00:34:43.281 --> 00:34:47.151
TRENDS SO. THAT'S THE- GOOD THE

00:34:47.218 --> 00:34:49.086
REASON WE CALL IT A WINDFALL

00:34:49.153 --> 00:34:52.123
AND- IT ONE OTHER THING IS

00:34:52.190 --> 00:34:53.724
NOTABLE ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE

00:34:53.791 --> 00:34:56.194
BETWEEN THE OFFICES OUR OFFICE

00:34:56.260 --> 00:34:56.994
IN THE ADMINISTRATION'S

00:34:57.061 --> 00:34:58.863
ESTIMATE OF THIS ONE FALL IS

00:34:58.930 --> 00:35:00.364
THAT WE HAVE VERY SIMILAR

00:35:00.431 --> 00:35:02.767
REVENUE ESTIMATES. IN FACT OVER

00:35:02.834 --> 00:35:04.435
THE THREE YEAR BUDGET WINDOW

00:35:04.502 --> 00:35:06.437
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IS HIGHER

00:35:06.504 --> 00:35:08.272
THAN OUR OFFICE BY ABOUT ONE

00:35:08.339 --> 00:35:10.107
POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS

00:35:10.174 --> 00:35:16.714
WHICH IS. REVENUES IN BUDGET.

00:35:16.781 --> 00:35:18.649
SO THAT LEAVES THE QUESTION AS

00:35:18.716 --> 00:35:19.951
WELL WHAT IS CAUSING THE

00:35:20.017 --> 00:35:21.385
DIFFERENCE AND I THINK THERE

00:35:21.452 --> 00:35:23.120
ARE THREE MAIN REASONS FOR YOU

00:35:23.187 --> 00:35:27.391
TO CONSIDER THE FIRST IS THAT.

00:35:27.458 --> 00:35:29.961
THE ADMINISTRATION- HAS HIGHER

00:35:30.027 --> 00:35:32.463
CAPITAL GAINS RELATED TAX

00:35:32.530 --> 00:35:34.665
REVENUES AND ALSO HAS A

00:35:34.732 --> 00:35:36.234
DIFFERENT INTERPRETATION OF THE

00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:38.769
RULES FOR WHEN A DEPOSIT OR A

00:35:38.836 --> 00:35:41.038
TRUE UP DEPOSIT UNDER THE

00:35:41.105 --> 00:35:43.274
PROVISIONS OF PROPOSITION CHIU

00:35:43.341 --> 00:35:44.709
FOR THE STATE'S RAINY DAY FUND

00:35:44.775 --> 00:35:46.444
AND DEBT REPAYMENT REQUIREMENTS

00:35:46.511 --> 00:35:48.646
AND SO AS A RESULT. OF THOSE

00:35:48.713 --> 00:35:52.583
pGAINS AND THE- DIFFERENT

00:35:52.650 --> 00:35:55.720
INTERPRETATION OF WHEN A TRUE

00:35:55.786 --> 00:35:57.088
UP- DEPOSIT IS REQUIRED. BERMAN

00:35:57.154 --> 00:35:58.689
A FINANCE HAS A FIVE POINT SIX

00:35:58.756 --> 00:36:02.860
BILLION- YEAH AND- USE THEIR

00:36:02.927 --> 00:36:06.531
WHICH DETRACTS FROM THE SURPLUS

00:36:06.597 --> 00:36:07.765
THROUGH THE WINDFALL. THE

00:36:07.832 --> 00:36:10.635
SECOND DIFFERENCE IS THE

00:36:10.701 --> 00:36:12.270
ADMINISTRATION HAS ABOUT TWO

00:36:12.336 --> 00:36:13.871
POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS AND

00:36:13.938 --> 00:36:15.072
HIGHER COLLUDED RELATED

00:36:15.139 --> 00:36:17.575
EXPENDITURES THAN WE HAVE IN

00:36:17.642 --> 00:36:20.545
OUR- HAD IN OUR FISCAL OUTLOOK.

00:36:20.611 --> 00:36:21.946
AND THEN THIRD THE

00:36:22.013 --> 00:36:23.648
ADMINISTRATION HAS AROUND TWO

00:36:23.714 --> 00:36:26.284
BILLION YEN HIGHER HEALTH AND

00:36:26.350 --> 00:36:28.486
HUMAN SERVICE RELATED EXPENSES

00:36:28.553 --> 00:36:30.454
PRIMARILY THE CASELOAD DRIVEN

00:36:30.521 --> 00:36:35.293
PROGRAMS. OKAY SO. MOVING TO

00:36:35.359 --> 00:36:38.162
THE NEXT SLIDE HERE THE TWO

00:36:38.229 --> 00:36:40.831
FIGURES ON THIS SLIDE- IT OFFER

00:36:40.898 --> 00:36:42.233
A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT WAYS TO

00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:44.402
THINK ABOUT HOW THE GOVERNOR IS

00:36:44.468 --> 00:36:46.537
ALLOCATING THE WINDFALL- THE

00:36:46.604 --> 00:36:48.706
TOP FIGURE THE USE OR THE DONUT

00:36:48.773 --> 00:36:51.642
SHAPED FIGURE- PROVIDES A BREAK

00:36:51.709 --> 00:36:54.378
OUT IN THE FOLLOWING WAY THE

00:36:54.445 --> 00:36:57.081
GOVERNOR HAS EIGHT POINT ONE

00:36:57.148 --> 00:36:59.483

SPECIAL FUNDS FOR ECONOMIC

00:37:11.062 --> 00:37:13.364
UNCERTAINTY. TWO POINT FIVE

TAX REFUNDS FOR LOW INCOME

00:37:21.906 --> 00:37:24.675
TAXPAYERS- THE GOVERNOR

00:37:24.742 --> 00:37:26.410
ALLOCATES ONE POINT THREE

00:37:26.477 --> 00:37:28.446
BILLION TO NEW ONGOING

00:37:28.512 --> 00:37:31.082

00:39:24.695 --> 00:39:25.796

00:39:43.547 --> 00:39:43.981
THE STATE'S HIGHER NEED

00:39:44.048 --> 00:39:47.351
STUDENTS. AND THEN LAST THE

00:39:47.418 --> 00:39:49.153
THERE IS TWO POINT TWO BILLION

00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:51.122
TO US FUND THE LOCAL CONTROL

00:39:51.188 --> 00:39:52.690
FUNDING FORMULA COST OF LIVING

00:39:52.757 --> 00:39:56.927
ADJUSTMENT. OUR OUR OVERALL

00:39:56.994 --> 00:39:58.662
VIEW OF THE PROPOSITION NINETY

00:39:58.729 --> 00:39:59.730
EIGHT PROPOSALS THAT IT DOES

00:39:59.797 --> 00:40:01.799
REFLECT A VERY REASONABLE NEXT

00:40:01.866 --> 00:40:04.068
OF ONE TIME AND ONGOING

00:40:04.135 --> 00:40:06.604
PROPOSALS. IN PARTICULAR THE

00:40:06.670 --> 00:40:10.074
SIGNIFICANT SHARE OF- ONE TIME

00:40:10.141 --> 00:40:12.343
AS PER ONE TIME SPENDING

00:40:12.409 --> 00:40:14.745
PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNOR. IS

00:40:14.812 --> 00:40:17.214
PRUDENT BECAUSE IT PROVIDES A

00:40:17.281 --> 00:40:19.049
AN IMPORTANT QUESTION. IN THE

00:40:19.116 --> 00:40:20.684
SENSE THAT IN THE EVENT THAT

00:40:20.751 --> 00:40:22.720
THERE IS A FUTURE VOLATILITY IN

00:40:22.787 --> 00:40:24.188
THE MINIMUM GUARANTEE AND THERE

00:40:24.255 --> 00:40:26.157
IS A SIGNIFICANT DROP IN IT IT

00:40:26.223 --> 00:40:28.425
WOULD INSULATE- PROGRAMS FROM

00:40:28.492 --> 00:40:32.263
HAVING TO BE CUT SO SOON SO- WE

00:40:32.329 --> 00:40:33.330
THINK THAT THE PROPOSAL IS

00:40:33.397 --> 00:40:35.733
GENERALLY- FINDING ABOUT THE

00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:37.902
RIGHT MIX OF ONE TIME VERSUS

00:40:37.968 --> 00:40:42.673
ONGOING. OKAY ARE MOVING TO THE

00:40:42.740 --> 00:40:44.341
NEXT SLIDE HERE IS WHERE WE GET

00:40:44.408 --> 00:40:47.478
INTO A DISCUSSION OF THIS THE

00:40:47.545 --> 00:40:49.747
STATE'S PROPOSAL IN LIGHT OF

00:40:49.814 --> 00:40:53.184
THIS GENERAL RELIEF PACKAGE AS

00:40:53.250 --> 00:40:54.218
THE TRIGGER MENTION MENTION.

00:40:54.285 --> 00:40:56.153
AND WE JUST KNOW THAT THE

00:40:56.220 --> 00:40:57.555
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WAS

00:40:57.621 --> 00:41:00.991
DEVELOPED- BEFORE YOU YOU KNOW

00:41:01.058 --> 00:41:01.692
INHERENTLY WAS DEVELOPED

00:41:01.759 --> 00:41:04.628
BEFORE- THAT'S THE MOST RECENT

00:41:04.695 --> 00:41:05.462
FEDERAL RELIEF PACKAGE WAS

00:41:05.529 --> 00:41:07.932
ADOPTED. AND SO IN LIGHT OF

00:41:07.998 --> 00:41:10.968
THAT WE DO THINK THAT YOU MAY.

00:41:11.035 --> 00:41:13.304
WANT TO CONSIDER OR DETERMINE

00:41:13.370 --> 00:41:16.073
HOW BEST TO TARGET STATE

00:41:16.140 --> 00:41:19.143
RESOURCES. SO THAT THEY ARE

00:41:19.210 --> 00:41:20.878
GOING TO PEOPLE THAT ARE IN

00:41:20.945 --> 00:41:22.847
LINE TO ALREADY RECEIVED A

00:41:22.913 --> 00:41:26.016
FEDERAL ASSISTANCE. AND

00:41:26.083 --> 00:41:26.784
SECONDLY KIND OF RELATED TO

00:41:26.851 --> 00:41:30.588
THAT. WE WOULD SAY. YOU KNOW

00:41:30.654 --> 00:41:32.523
THE U. S. AS YOU MOVE FORWARD

00:41:32.590 --> 00:41:34.525
IN THIS PROCESS THAT THE STATE

00:41:34.592 --> 00:41:36.560
WOULD WANT TO BE CAREFUL TO

00:41:36.627 --> 00:41:38.662
COMPLEMENT THE FEDERAL RELIEF

00:41:38.729 --> 00:41:40.865
PACKAGES RATHER THAN A

00:41:40.931 --> 00:41:44.401
DUPLICATE THE FEDERAL EFFORTS.

00:41:44.468 --> 00:41:46.237
SO S. AS WAS MENTIONED THE

00:41:46.303 --> 00:41:49.073
GOVERNOR IS ASKING FOR YOUR

00:41:49.139 --> 00:41:50.574
APPROVAL IN THE LEGISLATURE

00:41:50.641 --> 00:41:53.878
SOME MAJOR SPENDING PROPOSALS

00:41:53.944 --> 00:41:55.913
TO BE TAKEN ON AN IMMEDIATE

00:41:55.980 --> 00:41:57.715
BASIS OR AND EARLY ACTION

00:41:57.781 --> 00:42:00.050
BASIS. THE SOME OF THE USERS

00:42:00.117 --> 00:42:01.452
AROUND TWELVE POINT EIGHT

00:42:01.518 --> 00:42:03.554
BILLION DOLLARS WITH FIVE

00:42:03.621 --> 00:42:05.055
BILLION OF IT BEING IN THE

00:42:05.122 --> 00:42:07.391
IMMEDIATE ACTION CATEGORIES.

00:42:07.458 --> 00:42:10.160
AND CATEGORY AND WE DO HAVE

00:42:10.227 --> 00:42:12.930
SOME CONCERN ABOUT IT A COUPLE

00:42:12.997 --> 00:42:15.900
OF THESE- MENTION YOU KNOW THEY

00:42:15.966 --> 00:42:17.668
THE TWO BILLION FOR A

00:42:17.735 --> 00:42:20.337
RESUMPTION OF IN PERSON

00:42:20.404 --> 00:42:22.106
INSTRUCTION TO THE SCHOOLS.

00:42:22.172 --> 00:42:23.841
REYES IS A BIT OF CONCERN

00:42:23.908 --> 00:42:27.344
BECAUSE- YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT

00:42:27.411 --> 00:42:29.146
CERTAIN THAT THE DISTRICTS

00:42:29.213 --> 00:42:31.148
WOULD BE ABLE TO MEET THE

00:42:31.215 --> 00:42:33.417
VARIOUS REQUIREMENTS NECESSARY

00:42:33.484 --> 00:42:34.685
WITHIN THE TIME LINE AS

00:42:34.752 --> 00:42:37.187
PROPOSED AND YOU KNOW THE

00:42:37.254 --> 00:42:38.188
CONCERNED THEY'RE BEING WE

00:42:38.255 --> 00:42:40.157
WOULDN'T WANT TO DISSUADE SOME

00:42:40.224 --> 00:42:41.325
OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS FROM

00:42:41.392 --> 00:42:42.760
PARTICIPATING BECAUSE THEY

00:42:42.826 --> 00:42:44.895
BELIEVE THAT THEY WOULD NOT BE.

00:42:44.962 --> 00:42:46.864
ABLE TO ACHIEVE THE MILESTONES

00:42:46.931 --> 00:42:50.167
NECESSARY SO THAT'S A CONCERN

00:42:50.234 --> 00:42:52.436
WE HAVE ON THAT ONE. ON THE-

00:42:52.503 --> 00:42:54.171
TAX REFUNDS FOR LOW INCOME

00:42:54.238 --> 00:42:55.673
CALIFORNIANS AGAIN YOU KNOW

00:42:55.739 --> 00:42:58.175
THIS WAS DEVELOPED. BEFORE WE

00:42:58.242 --> 00:43:00.177
HAD THE FINAL SHOULD RELIEF

00:43:00.244 --> 00:43:03.414
PACKAGE AND SO YOU KNOW THE

00:43:03.480 --> 00:43:05.015
UNDER THAT PACKAGE MOST

00:43:05.082 --> 00:43:06.550
TAXPAYERS IN THE COUNTRY WILL

00:43:06.617 --> 00:43:08.786
RECEIVE A SIX HUNDRED DOLLAR

00:43:08.852 --> 00:43:11.555
STIMULUS CHECKS AND THAT'S THE

00:43:11.622 --> 00:43:14.892
AMOUNT OF THE- GOLDEN STATE

00:43:14.959 --> 00:43:16.327
STIMULUS PROGRAM AND SO. YOU

00:43:16.393 --> 00:43:17.494
KNOW YOU MAY WANT TO CONSIDER

00:43:17.561 --> 00:43:21.131
WAYS TO TARGET THOSE FUNDS TO.

00:43:21.198 --> 00:43:22.666
YOU KNOW PEOPLE THAT ARE NOT

00:43:22.733 --> 00:43:25.035
RECEIVING THAT KIND OF STUFF US

00:43:25.102 --> 00:43:27.705
FEDERAL SUPPORT. BUT THEN WHEN

00:43:27.771 --> 00:43:38.749
IT COMES. TO THE SMALL BUSINESS

00:43:38.816 --> 00:43:40.484
AND NONPROFIT THIS IS GROUP.

00:43:40.551 --> 00:43:42.119
AND THE FEE WAIVER- WE THINK

00:43:42.186 --> 00:43:44.421
THOSE ARE. REASONABLE YEAH-

00:43:44.488 --> 00:43:45.322
WORTH YOUR YOU KNOW WORTH YOUR

00:43:54.098 --> 00:43:55.833
MORE TIME TO CONSIDER THEM IN

00:43:55.899 --> 00:43:58.736
SO WE COULD FORWARD FOR YOU IS-

00:43:58.802 --> 00:44:00.337
A FRAMEWORK FOR THINKING ABOUT

00:44:00.404 --> 00:44:02.673
THEM REALLY IN THE FORM OF FOUR

00:44:02.740 --> 00:44:06.243
QUESTIONS WHICH ARE ARE-

POTENTIAL FOR SUCCESS OF THE

00:44:38.242 --> 00:44:43.447
PROPOSAL- SO THAT'S KIND OF A

00:44:43.514 --> 00:44:45.616

00:47:58.976 --> 00:48:05.649
CHAMBERLAIN AND AT FINANCE SURE.

00:48:05.716 --> 00:48:10.320
I GOOD GOOD MORNING- SO YOU'RE

00:48:10.387 --> 00:48:11.355
YOU'RE CORRECT WE ARE

00:48:11.421 --> 00:48:13.323
PROJECTING SLOWING GROWTH OF

00:48:13.390 --> 00:48:14.625
REVENUES OVER THE NEXT COUPLE

00:48:14.691 --> 00:48:17.694
YEARS THE REAL REASON IS THAT-

00:48:17.761 --> 00:48:19.830
HELLO I TAKE THE MAYES THERE'S

00:48:19.896 --> 00:48:21.131
TWO REASONS I GUESS. THAT I

00:48:21.198 --> 00:48:23.066
WOULD THAT WOULD POINT TO FIRST

00:48:23.133 --> 00:48:25.502
OF ALL- CAPITAL GAINS IS

00:48:25.569 --> 00:48:28.138
EXPECTED HIT A PEAK IN THE

00:48:28.205 --> 00:48:29.539
CURRENT CALENDAR YEAR SO IN THE

00:48:29.606 --> 00:48:31.308
END OF THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE

00:48:31.375 --> 00:48:32.576
CALENDAR WE EXPECT CAPITAL

00:48:32.643 --> 00:48:34.578
GAINS TO PEAK. AND EXPECT THEM

00:48:34.645 --> 00:48:35.979
TO BE DROPPING OFF AFTER AFTER

00:48:36.046 --> 00:48:38.348
THAT AND THIS IS BASED ON THE

00:48:38.415 --> 00:48:39.216
ASSUMPTION THAT THE STOCK

00:48:39.283 --> 00:48:41.852
MARKET. IS GOING TO BE IS

00:48:41.918 --> 00:48:44.621
HIGHLY VALUED AT THIS POINT AND

00:48:44.688 --> 00:48:48.191
THAT IT COULD- THE STOCK MARKET

00:48:48.258 --> 00:48:49.459
SHOULD GROW ONLY SLOWLY OVER

00:48:49.526 --> 00:48:50.527
THE COMING YEARS WITH IT WHICH

00:48:50.594 --> 00:48:52.362
I THINK IS CONSISTENT WITH

00:48:52.429 --> 00:48:55.232
WHAT. THE L. WAS ME ON THE

00:48:55.299 --> 00:48:57.768
OTHER THING IS THAT- AS AS

00:48:57.834 --> 00:49:03.707
ERICA HAS POINTED OUT. WE HAD-

00:49:03.774 --> 00:49:05.509
HELLO OF THE A LOT OF THE PAIN

00:49:05.575 --> 00:49:07.744
THAT FELT THIS. IN OF AMERICAN

00:49:07.811 --> 00:49:10.781
PAIN WAS AT THE WAS BY LOW WAGE.

00:49:10.847 --> 00:49:14.518
SO THAT- THE WAGE GROWTH ARE

00:49:14.584 --> 00:49:15.786
YOU ARE THE WAY TO CLIENTS THAT

00:49:15.852 --> 00:49:18.155
WE SAW WERE WAS REALLY. A FOCUS

00:49:18.221 --> 00:49:19.856
ON LOW WAGE EARNERS WHICH MEANT

00:49:19.923 --> 00:49:22.359
THAT- THE DISTRIBUTION OF

00:49:22.426 --> 00:49:26.063
INCOME BECAME OF MORE HAVE.

00:49:26.129 --> 00:49:28.665
BECAME MORE EXAGGERATED AND

00:49:28.732 --> 00:49:32.369
THAT THE- BETWEEN HIGH INCOME

00:49:32.436 --> 00:49:34.104
LOW INCOME DURING THIS PERIOD

00:49:34.171 --> 00:49:35.806
WE EXPECT SOME OF THAT- WIND

00:49:35.872 --> 00:49:38.575
AND OVER THE NEXT COUPLE YEARS.

00:49:38.642 --> 00:49:42.379
AS HAS A LOW WAGE EARNERS- WE

00:49:42.446 --> 00:49:44.815
HAVE RETURNED TO THEIR JOBS AND

00:49:44.881 --> 00:49:46.616
SO LONG THE WAGE GROWTH. OR

00:49:46.683 --> 00:49:48.418
LISA DID- SOMEWHAT HIGHER

00:49:48.485 --> 00:49:49.252
PERCENTAGES OF WAGE GROWTH IN

00:49:49.319 --> 00:49:50.721
COMING YEARS WILL BE LOW INCOME

00:49:50.787 --> 00:49:52.723
SO THOSE TWO FACTORS ARE GOING

00:49:52.789 --> 00:49:55.525
TO MEAN THAT- THAT WE WILL HAVE

00:49:55.592 --> 00:49:57.627
DROPPED A DROP IN CAPS GAINS

00:49:57.694 --> 00:49:59.229
AND WAGE GROWTH WE DO GET. IS

00:49:59.296 --> 00:50:00.330
GOING TO BE TAXED AT A LOWER

00:50:00.397 --> 00:50:03.066
RATE AND SO OVERALL- WE EXPECT

00:50:03.133 --> 00:50:08.472
REVENUES. TO GROW FAIRLY SLOWLY.

00:50:08.538 --> 00:50:09.072
I'M L. A. O. D. YOU WANT TO

00:50:09.139 --> 00:50:12.609
THAT- I'D BE TO THANK YOU MADAM

00:50:12.676 --> 00:50:15.912
CHAIR. SIMILAR TO. DEPARTMENT

00:50:15.979 --> 00:50:18.081
OF FINANCE I THINK IN OUR-

00:50:18.148 --> 00:50:19.950
MULTI YEAR OUTLOOK WE HAVE

00:50:20.016 --> 00:50:22.586
RELATIVELY GRADUAL APPRECIATION

00:50:22.652 --> 00:50:24.554
IN THE STOCK MARKET CERTAINLY

00:50:24.621 --> 00:50:27.457
THAT COULD BE. PROVEN TO BE

00:50:27.524 --> 00:50:29.793
WRONG IT COULD BE HIGHER- YOU

00:50:29.860 --> 00:50:32.329
COULD BE LOWER BUT WE SAT THE

00:50:32.396 --> 00:50:34.297
BEST THE BEST ESTIMATE IS TO

00:50:34.364 --> 00:50:35.532
KIND OF GO FROM WHERE WE ARE

00:50:35.599 --> 00:50:37.134
AND EXT EXPECT CUTS SOME

00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:39.469
GRADUAL APPRECIATION ONE THING

00:50:39.536 --> 00:50:41.638
WE DID IN OUR NOVEMBER FISCAL

00:50:41.705 --> 00:50:43.874
OUTLOOK IS ASKED A QUESTION.

00:50:43.940 --> 00:50:46.343
HOW MUCH ADDITIONAL REVENUE

00:50:46.410 --> 00:50:48.745
WOOD MISSTATED ORDER TO NOT

00:50:48.812 --> 00:50:51.281
HAVE THESE STRUCTURAL. DEFICITS

00:50:51.348 --> 00:50:54.584
EMERGE AND WHAT WE DETERMINED

00:50:54.651 --> 00:50:57.988
IN THAT EXERCISE WAS THAT WHILE

00:50:58.054 --> 00:51:00.357
YOU UNDOUBTEDLY WILL BE WRONG

00:51:00.424 --> 00:51:02.292
TO SOME DEGREE AS WE TRY TO

00:51:02.359 --> 00:51:04.428
FORECAST REVENUES BY THE

00:51:04.494 --> 00:51:06.329
LIKELIHOOD THAT WE WOULD HAVE

00:51:06.396 --> 00:51:08.698
ENOUGH NATURAL REVENUE GROWTH

00:51:08.765 --> 00:51:09.800
TO ELIMINATE THE STRUCTURAL

00:51:09.866 --> 00:51:11.568
DEFICIT JUST KIND OF ON THE

00:51:11.635 --> 00:51:14.204
NATURAL. WORLD IS UNLIKELY KIND

00:51:14.271 --> 00:51:16.339
OF OUTSIDE OF THE BEYOND THIS

00:51:16.406 --> 00:51:17.674
YOU KNOW STANDARD DEVIATION

00:51:17.741 --> 00:51:20.210
THAT WE WOULD EXPECT. AND

00:51:20.277 --> 00:51:25.215
EXPECT AS AS POSSIBLE OR LIKELY-

00:51:25.282 --> 00:51:26.616
THAT BEING SAID ONE OF THE

00:51:26.683 --> 00:51:28.752
ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSALS WAS

00:51:28.819 --> 00:51:32.823
TO. RETHINK THE SCAR STATUARY

00:51:32.889 --> 00:51:34.424
SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT TO SCHOOLS

00:51:34.491 --> 00:51:36.059
AND THAT WAS A SIGNIFICANT

00:51:36.126 --> 00:51:37.494
CONTRIBUTOR TO THE STRUCTURAL

00:51:37.561 --> 00:51:38.795
DEFICIT SO THE STRUCTURAL

00:51:38.862 --> 00:51:41.231
DEFICIT WOULD BE SMALLER NOW

00:51:41.298 --> 00:51:43.934
THAN WHAT WE WERE EXT YOU KNOW

00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:45.802
FORECASTING IN NOVEMBER. SO AS

00:51:45.869 --> 00:51:47.737
A RESULT OF THAT IT MIGHT BE

00:51:47.804 --> 00:51:50.140
SOMEWHAT- MORE LIKELY THAT ARE

00:51:50.207 --> 00:51:52.175
REVENUES WHICH OUTPERFORMED OUR

00:51:52.242 --> 00:51:54.110
BASELINE EXPECTATIONS ENOUGH TO

00:51:54.177 --> 00:51:55.378
ELIMINATE THE STRUCTURAL

00:51:55.445 --> 00:51:59.516
DEFICIT- BUT- YOU KNOW. BY AND

00:51:59.583 --> 00:52:01.184
LARGE I THINK- THE OTHER

00:52:01.251 --> 00:52:03.086
COMMENTS- BY MY COLLEAGUE FROM

00:52:03.153 --> 00:52:05.956
FINANCE PROBABLY ARE- IN LINE

00:52:06.022 --> 00:52:07.691
WITH IT THE WORK THAT YOU THAT

00:52:07.757 --> 00:52:09.125
WE WOULD HAVE AND I COULD OFFER

00:52:09.192 --> 00:52:10.393
THEM I DON'T KNOW IF MY

00:52:10.460 --> 00:52:11.828
COLLEAGUE BRIAN DEALER WHO

00:52:11.895 --> 00:52:13.630
OVERSEES OUR REVENUE

00:52:13.697 --> 00:52:18.201
FORECASTING- EFFORTS IT'S. IF

00:52:18.268 --> 00:52:20.403
HE WOULD WANT TO ADD ANYTHING.

00:52:20.470 --> 00:52:21.571
YEAH THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR

00:52:21.638 --> 00:52:22.672
GRANULAR WITH THE ALIEN JUST

00:52:22.739 --> 00:52:24.708
REAL QUICKLY JUST. TO GET A

00:52:24.774 --> 00:52:26.243
LITTLE BIT OF CONTEXT ON WHY WE

00:52:26.309 --> 00:52:28.445
MIGHT BE EXPECTING SOMEWHAT

00:52:28.512 --> 00:52:30.547
SLOWER ECONOMIC AND REVENUE

00:52:30.614 --> 00:52:32.215
GROWTH FOR THE FOR THE OUT

00:52:32.282 --> 00:52:34.618
YEARS. I THINK THE SIMPLE STORY

00:52:34.684 --> 00:52:37.120
IS THAT WE SEEN. A LARGE KIND

00:52:37.187 --> 00:52:39.222
OF DISLOCATION BOTH IN THE

00:52:39.289 --> 00:52:40.357
STATE'S LABOR MARKETS AND IN

00:52:40.423 --> 00:52:42.125
OUR- OKAY A SMALL BUSINESS

00:52:42.192 --> 00:52:45.529
COMMUNITY AND THE- WELL WE'VE

00:52:45.595 --> 00:52:49.032
SEEN THAT. RECOVER FASTER FROM

00:52:49.099 --> 00:52:51.501
THE DEPTHS OF THE TENDER EARLY

00:52:51.568 --> 00:52:52.168
PANDEMIC RECESSION THAN WE

00:52:52.235 --> 00:52:53.970
MIGHT HAVE EXPECTED THERE STILL

00:52:54.037 --> 00:52:55.572
ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE EMPLOYED

00:52:55.639 --> 00:52:57.140
THERE STILL ARE A LOT OF.

00:52:57.207 --> 00:52:58.975
BUSINESSES THAT ARE FACING

00:52:59.042 --> 00:52:59.910
SIGNIFICANT REVENUE LOSSES AND

00:52:59.976 --> 00:53:02.078
IT WILL TAKE A NUMBER OF YEARS

00:53:02.145 --> 00:53:05.115
FOR- THOSE ARE FACTS TO CORRECT

00:53:05.181 --> 00:53:06.917
AND FOR US TO GET BACK TO KIND

00:53:06.983 --> 00:53:11.221
OF PRE PANDEMIC ECONOMIC LEVELS.

00:53:11.288 --> 00:53:14.858
THANK YOU. I'M I NOTE THAT MR

00:53:14.925 --> 00:53:16.159
PADDICK IN YOUR SLIDES YOU

00:53:16.226 --> 00:53:18.194
REFERENCED A THAT IN THE

00:53:18.261 --> 00:53:19.796
NOVEMBER FORECAST YOU TALKED

00:53:19.863 --> 00:53:23.033
ABOUT THE STRUCTURAL. ACTED

00:53:23.099 --> 00:53:24.301
STRUCTURAL DEFICIT WHICH OF

00:53:24.367 --> 00:53:26.202
COURSE HAS BEEN REPEATED AND I

00:53:26.269 --> 00:53:27.871
DON'T NEED AN ANSWER NOW AND IT

00:53:27.938 --> 00:53:28.772
COULD HAVE BEEN IN THAT

00:53:28.838 --> 00:53:30.607
DOCUMENT I CAN LOOK BACK BUT I

00:53:30.674 --> 00:53:32.375
THINK THAT AT SOME POINT WE ARE

00:53:32.442 --> 00:53:33.643
GOING TO WANT TO HEAR

00:53:33.710 --> 00:53:36.479
CONCRETELY WHAT RECOMMENDATIONS

00:53:36.546 --> 00:53:39.149
ARE MIGHT BE HAVE. TO DO OUR

00:53:39.215 --> 00:53:41.618
BEST TO AVOID THAT STRUCTURAL

00:53:41.685 --> 00:53:42.686
DEFICIT BUT DON'T ADDRESS THAT

00:53:42.752 --> 00:53:44.888
NOW I'M JUST PUTTING THAT OUT

00:53:44.955 --> 00:53:49.926
IS AND- KIND OF. NOTE I HAVE

00:53:49.993 --> 00:53:53.163
TWO MORE QUESTIONS ONE IS THAT-

00:53:53.229 --> 00:53:55.465
THE PROPOSAL FROM THE FROM THE

00:53:55.532 --> 00:53:57.334
US FROM THE GOVERNOR INCLUDES A

00:53:57.400 --> 00:54:00.337
TRUE UP. TO OUR RESERVE STORE

00:54:00.403 --> 00:54:02.572
BUDGET STABILIZATION ACCOUNT.

00:54:02.639 --> 00:54:03.673
AND THAT'S THREE POINT TWO

00:54:03.740 --> 00:54:06.676
BILLION. NOW WE SUSPENDED LAST

00:54:06.743 --> 00:54:08.078
YEAR BECAUSE OF OUR

00:54:08.144 --> 00:54:09.346
UNDERSTANDING THAT WE WERE IN

00:54:09.412 --> 00:54:11.014
FISCAL EMERGENCY AND WE MIGHT

00:54:11.081 --> 00:54:13.350
BE IN A DEFICIT WE SUSPENDED.

00:54:13.416 --> 00:54:15.619
PUTTING THE DEPOSIT IN. ARE WE

00:54:15.685 --> 00:54:19.155
LEGALLY REQUIRED TO MAKE A TRUE

00:54:19.222 --> 00:54:24.094
UP DEPOSIT IN THIS CURRENT YEAR.

00:54:24.160 --> 00:54:26.529
MADAM CHAIR- I BELIEVE I READ

00:54:26.596 --> 00:54:28.131
IS THAT WE NEED TO MAKE THAT

00:54:28.198 --> 00:54:30.200
TRIP AND I AM GOING TO PASS

00:54:30.266 --> 00:54:32.135
THIS TO POLICE EMERGENCY FOR

00:54:32.202 --> 00:54:37.307
SOME MORE DETAILS. GOOD

00:54:37.374 --> 00:54:41.177
AFTERNOON. RESEARCHERS INCLUDES

00:54:41.244 --> 00:54:45.348
PART IN A FINANCE. I'M SORRY

00:54:45.415 --> 00:54:47.417
CAN YOU HEAR OTHER YEAH- YES SO

00:54:47.484 --> 00:54:50.053
WE ARE READING THE LAW IS THAT

00:54:50.120 --> 00:54:51.087
IT WHAT WE'RE DOING IS

00:54:51.154 --> 00:54:52.922
CONSISTENT WITH THE LAW AS IT

00:54:52.989 --> 00:54:54.924
STANDS ON SO WE BELIEVE IT'S A

00:54:54.991 --> 00:54:57.894
REASONABLE. EXPECTATION TO PUT

00:54:57.961 --> 00:55:01.064
THE OUT THIS TRANSFER INTO THE

00:55:01.131 --> 00:55:03.299
S. NINE AND IT'S FOUR POINT TWO

00:55:03.366 --> 00:55:04.234
BILLION IT WAS A BILLION FOR

00:55:04.300 --> 00:55:06.436
THE NINETEEN TWENTY TRUE UP AND

00:55:06.503 --> 00:55:08.405
FOR THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO

00:55:08.471 --> 00:55:09.305
TRUMPETS THREE POINT TWO

00:55:09.372 --> 00:55:11.541
BILLION DOLLARS FOR A TOTAL OF

00:55:11.608 --> 00:55:14.110
FOUR POINT TWO BILLION. THROAT

00:55:14.177 --> 00:55:16.813
THIS NOTE WE HAVE NOT- WE HAVE

00:55:16.880 --> 00:55:21.451
NOT- LIFTED THE ACTION ON A

00:55:21.518 --> 00:55:22.986
FISCAL EMERGENCY AND YOU DON'T

00:55:23.053 --> 00:55:25.755
HAVE TO RESPOND BUT IT WOULD

00:55:25.822 --> 00:55:27.424
SEEM TO ME THAT THE LEGAL READ

00:55:27.490 --> 00:55:30.226
M. WOULD HAVE TO BE BASED ON.

00:55:30.293 --> 00:55:32.195
THAT FACT THAT THE REASON WE

00:55:32.262 --> 00:55:34.864
DID NOT HAVE TO PUT THE DEPOSIT

00:55:34.931 --> 00:55:35.832
IN LAST YEAR'S BECAUSE WE

00:55:35.899 --> 00:55:37.133
SUSPENDED BASED ON IF IT'S

00:55:37.200 --> 00:55:39.536
GOING TO EMERGENCY WE'VE WE

00:55:39.602 --> 00:55:42.338
HAVE NOT ACTED TO DISMANTLE

00:55:42.405 --> 00:55:45.141
THAT DECLARATION BUT I'LL LEAVE

00:55:45.208 --> 00:55:49.546
THAT AGAIN IS JUST. A POINT- I

00:55:49.612 --> 00:55:50.947
WAS GOING TO ASK A QUESTION

00:55:51.014 --> 00:55:56.619
ABOUT- THE- B. CARES ACT MONEY

00:55:56.686 --> 00:55:58.288
AND THE FACT THAT THERE IS A

00:55:58.354 --> 00:56:00.924
SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF IT SIX

00:56:00.990 --> 00:56:03.093
POINT SEVEN BILLION FOR SCHOOLS

00:56:03.159 --> 00:56:06.162
AND- JUST HOW THAT OVERLAPS

00:56:06.229 --> 00:56:07.831
WITH WHAT THE GOVERNORS ASKING

00:56:07.897 --> 00:56:09.833
FOR EARLY ACTION BUT I IMAGINE

00:56:09.899 --> 00:56:11.668
OTHER MEMBERS WILL WANT TO GET

00:56:11.735 --> 00:56:12.869
INTO THAT IN MORE DETAIL SO

00:56:12.936 --> 00:56:15.205
I'LL LEAVE IT. AND LET THEM AND

00:56:15.271 --> 00:56:17.006
LET ME ASK MY LAST QUESTION

00:56:17.073 --> 00:56:20.410
WHICH IS THAT OUR- ACTION IN

00:56:20.477 --> 00:56:22.412
JUNE ON THE BUDGET FOR THIS

00:56:22.479 --> 00:56:24.647
CURRENT YEAR SUSPENDED SOME

00:56:24.714 --> 00:56:28.017
PROGRAMS BECAUSE OF OUR CONCERN

00:56:28.084 --> 00:56:30.153
THAT WE WOULD HAVE WE WOULD

00:56:30.220 --> 00:56:32.822
HAVE INADEQUATE REVENUES AND

00:56:32.889 --> 00:56:35.625
THESE SUSPENSIONS. IF THEY HAD

00:56:35.692 --> 00:56:38.194
IF THEY WERE HAD ACTUALLY GONE

00:56:38.261 --> 00:56:40.930
INTO EFFECT OR CUTS TO VERY

00:56:40.997 --> 00:56:42.932
CRITICAL PROGRAMS AND SERVICES

00:56:42.999 --> 00:56:46.703
SUCH AS BY H. S. S. OR IN HOME

00:56:46.770 --> 00:56:48.138
SUPPORT SERVICES ARE

00:56:48.204 --> 00:56:49.672
DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY

00:56:49.739 --> 00:56:51.508
PROVIDER PAYMENTS ARE MEDICARE

00:56:51.574 --> 00:56:54.511
PROVIDER RATES- ON VARIOUS

00:56:54.577 --> 00:56:56.412
THINGS LIKE THAT. ALL OF WHICH

00:56:56.479 --> 00:56:59.616
OF COURSE DURING A PANDEMIC ARE

00:56:59.682 --> 00:57:02.352
UNDER GREATER NEED THAN EVER-

00:57:02.418 --> 00:57:05.355
BUT WHAT I NOTE IS THAT AT THE

00:57:05.421 --> 00:57:08.892
SAME TIME THAT THIS WELL WE ARE

00:57:08.958 --> 00:57:11.027
NOT ACTING OR RATHER THIS

00:57:11.094 --> 00:57:12.262
PROPOSED BUDGET WOULD NOT

00:57:12.328 --> 00:57:14.597
SUSPENDED PROGRAMS IT DOES

00:57:14.664 --> 00:57:17.200
PROJECT SUSPENDING THEM IN THE

00:57:17.267 --> 00:57:19.335
YEAR FOLLOWING HOWEVER THE

00:57:19.402 --> 00:57:20.770
BUDGET THAT YOU AFTERWARDS

00:57:20.837 --> 00:57:22.739
GOVERNOR'S PRESENTED ALSO

00:57:22.806 --> 00:57:26.509
INCLUDES ESTABLISHING CAL TEAM.

00:57:26.576 --> 00:57:28.745
WHICH I INTENDED TO RETHINK

00:57:28.812 --> 00:57:30.580
AND ENHANCE MEDIC CAL BUT IT

00:57:30.647 --> 00:57:33.283
HAS A SIGNIFICANT ON GOING COST

00:57:33.349 --> 00:57:36.019
SO I WOULD LIKE TO JUST GET

00:57:36.085 --> 00:57:38.288
FROM D. O. F. WHY DOES THE

00:57:38.354 --> 00:57:40.290
ONGOING BUDGET STRUCTURE

00:57:40.356 --> 00:57:43.426
SUPPORT CAL AIMED. HOWEVER

00:57:43.493 --> 00:57:48.064
WOULD CONTINUE TO MAKE THE CUTS

00:57:48.131 --> 00:57:48.698
TO THE CRITICAL PROGRAMS THAT I

00:57:48.765 --> 00:57:50.767
REFERENCED. KAREN THANK YOU FOR

00:57:50.834 --> 00:57:52.869
THAT QUESTION MADAM CHAIR- I

00:57:52.936 --> 00:57:54.871
WOULD JUST SAY THAT IN IN LIGHT

00:57:54.938 --> 00:57:56.372
OF THE IMPROVE REVENUES WE DO

00:57:56.439 --> 00:57:58.842
DELAY- THE SCUTTLED SUSPENSIONS

00:57:58.908 --> 00:58:01.544
I THINK THEY ARE DELAYED RATHER

00:58:01.611 --> 00:58:05.348
THAN- TAKEN OFF- THE TOP TAKEN

00:58:05.415 --> 00:58:07.050
OFF THE TABLE BECAUSE OF THE

00:58:07.116 --> 00:58:08.351
OPERATING DEFICIT THAT WE

00:58:08.418 --> 00:58:10.320
FORESEE. IN THE FUTURE AND SO

00:58:10.386 --> 00:58:11.721
THAT THEY ARE A POTENTIAL

00:58:11.788 --> 00:58:13.923
SOLUTION AND- LIKE OTHER

00:58:13.990 --> 00:58:16.693
THINGS- THINGS WHICH THAT THE

00:58:16.759 --> 00:58:18.361
REVENUE PICTURE WILL CHANGE

00:58:18.428 --> 00:58:20.029
COME MAY AND AT THE MAY

00:58:20.096 --> 00:58:21.664
REVISION IT WILL TAKE A LOOK TO

00:58:21.731 --> 00:58:23.967
SEE WHAT'S WHAT IS AVAILABLE-

00:58:24.033 --> 00:58:25.869
BUT ASK YOUR SECOND POINT CAL

00:58:25.935 --> 00:58:28.204
AMES CAL AIM IS ONE OF FEW

00:58:28.271 --> 00:58:30.306
ONGOING EXPENDITURES THAT WE DO

00:58:30.373 --> 00:58:31.941
PROPOSED IN THE BUDGET. AND

00:58:32.008 --> 00:58:33.243
WHAT WE SEE THIS AS SOMETHING

00:58:33.309 --> 00:58:36.312
THAT IS REQUIRED NOW SO THAT WE

00:58:36.379 --> 00:58:37.780
CAN HAVE ON GOING SAVINGS IN

00:58:37.847 --> 00:58:40.083
THE FUTURE TO HELP REDUCE BOTH

00:58:40.149 --> 00:58:40.717
INCREASE THE QUALITY AND REDUCE

00:58:40.783 --> 00:58:43.253
THE COST. OF TAKING CARE OF

00:58:43.319 --> 00:58:45.355
POPULATION SO THAT IS WHY YOU

00:58:45.421 --> 00:58:50.293
SEE- KELLY. IN AS A PRIORITY IN

00:58:50.360 --> 00:58:51.728
THIS BUDGET. CERTIFIED OR STAND

00:58:51.794 --> 00:58:52.762
SO MY QUESTION ACTUALLY INTO

00:58:52.829 --> 00:58:55.098
PARTS IT WAS ONE AND THAT WAS

00:58:55.164 --> 00:58:57.700
THAT YES YOU DO DO YOU DO YOU

00:58:57.767 --> 00:58:58.968
CONTINUE THE PROGRAM

00:58:59.035 --> 00:59:00.503
SUSPENSIONS THERE JUST DELAYED

00:59:00.570 --> 00:59:01.738
FOR THE MOMENT HOWEVER YOU

00:59:01.804 --> 00:59:04.941
RECOMMEND. A BRAND NEW PROGRAM.

00:59:05.008 --> 00:59:07.810

00:59:07.877 --> 00:59:10.413
HIGHS G. OF COST. AND WHAT I

00:59:10.480 --> 00:59:11.881
UNDERSTAND THE ANSWER IS THAT

00:59:11.948 --> 00:59:13.283
BECAUSE THE ADMINISTRATION

00:59:13.349 --> 00:59:15.285
BELIEVES THAT CAL AIMS WILL

00:59:15.351 --> 00:59:18.888
REDUCE COSTS OVER TIME DID I.

00:59:18.955 --> 00:59:19.822

FINANCED IT YOU CAN. RESPOND TO

01:00:22.218 --> 01:00:24.220
OFFLINE AND THAT IS A NUMBER OF

01:00:24.287 --> 01:00:25.355
US ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE

01:00:25.421 --> 01:00:26.990
MONEY THAT IS IN THE BUDGET FOR

01:00:27.056 --> 01:00:29.359
WILDLAND FIRE AND WE WANT TO

01:00:29.425 --> 01:00:31.928
KNOW. FROM WHERE OUR LOCAL FIRE

01:00:31.995 --> 01:00:33.262
SAFE COUNCILS WHETHER THEY CAN

01:00:33.329 --> 01:00:35.398
APPLY WORDS JUST GOING THROUGH

01:00:35.465 --> 01:00:37.100
OTHER GOVERNMENT INSTITUTIONS

01:00:37.166 --> 01:00:39.869
AND THEY'RE AT MERCED UC AND

01:00:39.936 --> 01:00:41.671
CAL POLY THERE'S RESEARCH ON

01:00:41.738 --> 01:00:42.872
WILDLAND FIRE WOULD LIKE TO

01:00:42.939 --> 01:00:44.374
KNOW WHAT THEY'RE ELIGIBLE SO

01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:45.575
OFFLINE IF YOU COULD JUST LET

01:00:45.641 --> 01:00:48.444
US KNOW WHO'S ELIGIBLE FOR THAT

01:00:48.511 --> 01:00:49.879
MONEY OTHER THAN THAN CAL FIRE.

01:00:49.946 --> 01:00:52.081
BUT THE QUESTIONS THAT I WANT

01:00:52.148 --> 01:00:54.584
TO ASK MORE ABOUT EDUCATION AND

01:00:54.650 --> 01:00:56.853
THE CHAIR JUST TEED UP MARCH

01:00:56.919 --> 01:00:59.088
FIRST QUESTION PERFECTLY AND

01:00:59.155 --> 01:01:01.357
THAT IS IN THE GOVERNOR'S

01:01:01.424 --> 01:01:03.493
PROPOSED BUDGET IN THIS IS TO

01:01:03.559 --> 01:01:05.628
FINANCE IN THE GOVERNOR'S

01:01:05.695 --> 01:01:07.163
PROPOSED BUDGET THERE'S TWO

01:01:07.230 --> 01:01:09.132
BILLION FOR SCHOOL RE OPENING

01:01:09.198 --> 01:01:11.134
AND THEN THERE'S FOUR POINT SIX

01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:13.102
BILLION FOR ACADEMIC SUPPORTS

01:01:13.169 --> 01:01:15.238
WHICH AMAZINGLY ADDS UP TO SIX

01:01:15.304 --> 01:01:17.040
POINT SIX BILLION. AND THEN THE

01:01:17.106 --> 01:01:18.207
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FROM THE

01:01:18.274 --> 01:01:21.177
CARES ACT A COUPLE OF DAYS

01:01:21.244 --> 01:01:22.011
AFTER THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED HIS

01:01:22.078 --> 01:01:25.148
BUDGET- ALLOCATED SIX POINT

01:01:25.214 --> 01:01:26.315
SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS TO K.

01:01:26.382 --> 01:01:27.884
THROUGH TWELVE EDUCATION IN

01:01:27.950 --> 01:01:30.053
CALIFORNIA A TO FINANCED YOU

01:01:30.119 --> 01:01:32.588
CONTEMPLATE. OF THIS OF

01:01:32.655 --> 01:01:34.557
PLANTING SOME OF THE MONEY THAT

01:01:34.624 --> 01:01:38.895
YOU RECOMMENDED. FOR SCHOOLS

01:01:38.961 --> 01:01:40.196
HOW DOES IT FIT TOGETHER. THANK

01:01:40.263 --> 01:01:42.999
YOU FOR THAT. SENATOR AND I

01:01:43.066 --> 01:01:46.035
STATED EARLIER- WE DID NOT-

01:01:46.102 --> 01:01:48.171
INVISION OR INCLUDED THE

01:01:48.237 --> 01:01:50.773
FEDERAL STIMULUS AS PART OF-

01:01:50.840 --> 01:01:52.575
THE BASELINE FOR THE BUDGET.

01:01:52.642 --> 01:01:54.911
BECAUSE OF TIMING AND THAT THE

01:01:54.977 --> 01:01:55.978
TWO BILLION A FOUR POINT SIX

01:01:56.045 --> 01:01:59.048
BILLION- SUPPORT CREATED

01:01:59.115 --> 01:02:00.950
OBVIOUSLY NINE. I'M TIRED OF

01:02:01.017 --> 01:02:01.918
KNOWING WHAT THE FEDERAL

01:02:01.984 --> 01:02:03.853
GOVERNMENT WOULD SEND. STATES

01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:06.089
LET ALONE SENT TO CALIFORNIA

01:02:06.155 --> 01:02:09.192
SO- IT IN WE HAVE HEARD FROM

01:02:09.258 --> 01:02:10.326
MANY SCHOOLS THAT THE TWO

01:02:10.393 --> 01:02:11.527
MILLION ISN'T ENOUGH FOR THE

01:02:11.594 --> 01:02:12.995
FOUR POINT SIX BILLION IS ISN'T

01:02:13.062 --> 01:02:14.197
ENOUGH AND I THINK THAT AT THIS

01:02:14.263 --> 01:02:16.666
POINT. HOW WE SEE IT IS THAT

01:02:16.732 --> 01:02:19.435
THEY WOULD BE. COMPLEMENTARY SO

01:02:19.502 --> 01:02:20.470
ANY DOLLARS THAT THE STATE

01:02:20.536 --> 01:02:23.840
WOULD SPEND WOULD- ALSO BE.

01:02:23.906 --> 01:02:26.309
SUPPORTED BY FUTURE FEDERAL

01:02:26.375 --> 01:02:29.545
DOLLARS- AND THAT NUMBER JUST

01:02:29.612 --> 01:02:31.814
COINCIDENCE COINCIDENTALLY IS

01:02:31.881 --> 01:02:33.583
VERY SIMILAR BUT YOU'RE NOT

01:02:33.649 --> 01:02:35.785
CONTEMPLATING AMENDING YOUR

01:02:35.852 --> 01:02:38.454
RECOMMENDATIONS BASED ON THIS

01:02:38.521 --> 01:02:39.322
SIX POINT SEVEN BILLION

01:02:39.388 --> 01:02:42.625
ADDITIONAL MONEY THAT'S COME IN

01:02:42.692 --> 01:02:44.327
SINCE YOU PROPOSED. AGAIN I

01:02:44.393 --> 01:02:45.828
WOULD SAY THE THIS WAY THE

01:02:45.895 --> 01:02:47.230
VISION WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT THE

01:02:47.296 --> 01:02:48.798
FED GOVERNMENT WOULD BE FUNDING

01:02:48.865 --> 01:02:49.899
AND I THINK THAT WE NEED TO

01:02:49.966 --> 01:02:51.367
SPEND SOME TIME TO LOOK TO SEE

01:02:51.434 --> 01:02:53.636
WHAT- RESOURCES THE FEDERAL

01:02:53.703 --> 01:02:55.471
GOVERNMENT IS PROVIDING SO THAT

01:02:55.538 --> 01:02:56.639
WE CAN TAILOR THAT WITH OUR

01:02:56.706 --> 01:02:59.108
PROPOSAL- NOW AND INTO THE

01:02:59.175 --> 01:03:01.043
FUTURE WELL WHAT I WOULD SAY IS

01:03:01.110 --> 01:03:03.079
THAT- YOU OF ASK THE BUDGET

01:03:03.146 --> 01:03:05.248
COMMITTEE. TO DO EARLY ACTIONS

01:03:05.314 --> 01:03:07.116
WHICH WOULD REQUIRE US UNDER

01:03:07.183 --> 01:03:08.784
YOUR SCHEDULE TO ACT WITHIN THE

01:03:08.851 --> 01:03:10.052
NEXT TWO OR TWO AND A HALF

01:03:10.119 --> 01:03:12.121
WEEKS AND IT SEEMS TO US THAT

01:03:12.188 --> 01:03:12.889
THAT WOULD BE IMPORTANT

01:03:12.955 --> 01:03:15.358
INFORMATION TO HAVE. BEFORE WE

01:03:15.424 --> 01:03:17.627
WERE ASKED TO COMMIT BILLIONS

01:03:17.693 --> 01:03:19.295
OF DOLLARS SO I HOPE YOU WOULD

01:03:19.362 --> 01:03:21.364
JUST TAKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT-

01:03:21.430 --> 01:03:24.267
THE NEXT QUESTION I HAD- FOR

01:03:24.333 --> 01:03:26.903
FINANCE. IS THAT THERE WERE

01:03:26.969 --> 01:03:27.904
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF

01:03:27.970 --> 01:03:31.073
DEFERRALS TO COMMUNITY COLLEGES

01:03:31.140 --> 01:03:31.974
K. THROUGH TWELVE IN THE

01:03:32.041 --> 01:03:34.143
CURRENT BUDGET AND YOU PROPOSED

01:03:34.210 --> 01:03:36.779
PAYING OFF ROUGHLY TWO THIRDS

01:03:36.846 --> 01:03:38.915
OF IT. OF WHAT WAS YOUR NOW

01:03:38.981 --> 01:03:41.050
ASSISTS IN DECIDING HOW MUCH TO

01:03:41.117 --> 01:03:44.921
PAY OFF AND NOT TO ENTIRELY PAY

01:03:44.987 --> 01:03:47.056
OFF THE DEFERRALS. SURE AND I

01:03:47.123 --> 01:03:48.257
THINK THAT THE IDEA WAS TO PAY

01:03:48.324 --> 01:03:48.925
OFF AS MUCH AS WE COULD TO

01:03:48.991 --> 01:03:51.761
SUPPORT SCHOOLS CATER FOURTEEN.

01:03:51.827 --> 01:03:52.862
BUT ALSO TO ALLOW FOR SOME

01:03:52.929 --> 01:03:54.931
ADDITIONAL FINES SO UNDER

01:03:54.997 --> 01:03:57.333
PRESSURE PRIORITIES COULD BE

01:03:57.400 --> 01:04:00.069
ADDRESSED AS WELL. AND ARE YOU

01:04:00.136 --> 01:04:02.271
AWARE. OF DISTRICTS THAT ARE

01:04:02.338 --> 01:04:04.240
STRUGGLING WITH THE DEFERRAL

01:04:04.307 --> 01:04:07.410
PROD- PROCESS THAT. THIS MIGHT

PANDEMIC. THE BUDGET OUTLINED

01:07:35.184 --> 01:07:37.286
EXPECTATION THAT THE UNIVERSITY

TWO ACADEMIC YEAR. AT CURRENT

THIS YEAR TO NEXT YEAR- SO

01:07:55.004 --> 01:07:56.572
CERTAINLY I THINK THAT THAT IS

01:07:56.639 --> 01:07:57.940
ONE OF THE EXPECTATIONS OF THE

01:08:09.518 --> 01:08:11.921

UNDERSTANDING- ANOTHER

01:08:24.567 --> 01:08:25.734
COMPONENT I WOULD ADD IS THERE

01:08:25.801 --> 01:08:28.337
ARE RECENT CHANGES IN THE

01:08:28.404 --> 01:08:29.638
CORONAVIRUS RELIEF BILL. THAT

01:08:29.705 --> 01:08:33.075
ALTER THE ELIGIBILITY AND THE

OF WHAT THE STUDENT AID

01:08:39.849 --> 01:08:41.484
COMMISSION HAD BEEN LOOKING AT

01:08:41.550 --> 01:08:43.018
WHAT'S A LINING CAL GRANT

01:08:43.085 --> 01:08:44.854
ELIGIBILITY WITH FEDERAL

01:08:44.920 --> 01:08:47.456
ELIGIBILITY SO WITH THAT CHANGE

01:08:47.523 --> 01:08:48.991
IT MAY TAKE SOME TIME TO. WORK

01:08:49.058 --> 01:08:52.962
THROUGH THAT. AND SEE WHAT

01:08:53.028 --> 01:08:53.529
THOSE IMPACTS WOULD BE. OKAY

01:08:53.596 --> 01:08:56.432
THANK YOU MUCH AND THEN. ON TO

01:08:56.499 --> 01:08:59.101
THE OTHER MAJOR TOPICS-

01:08:59.168 --> 01:09:01.770
PROPOSAL TO REOPEN SCHOOLS AND

01:09:01.837 --> 01:09:02.805
I WOULD JUST SAY THE GOVERNOR

01:09:02.872 --> 01:09:04.673
SHOULD BE SALUTED FOR FORCING

01:09:04.740 --> 01:09:06.709
THE ISSUE AND THE FACT THAT.

01:09:06.775 --> 01:09:08.110
THERE ARE KIDS WITH SPECIAL

01:09:08.177 --> 01:09:11.280
NEEDS FOR FOSTER KIDS OR

01:09:11.347 --> 01:09:12.481
ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS

01:09:12.548 --> 01:09:14.450
RATHER THAN- FALLING BETWEEN

01:09:14.517 --> 01:09:16.685
THE CRACKS OF IT WE ALL

01:09:16.752 --> 01:09:18.721
STIPULATE THAT IN PERSON

01:09:18.787 --> 01:09:21.323
EDUCATION IS MUCH BETTER AND SO

01:09:21.390 --> 01:09:22.658
IT'S GOOD TO THE GOVERNOR'S

01:09:22.725 --> 01:09:24.460
DOING THIS BUT AS WE HEARD.

01:09:24.527 --> 01:09:26.495
FROM THE L. A. O. JUST A MOMENT

01:09:26.562 --> 01:09:28.964
AGO- THEY SAID IN THEIR

01:09:29.031 --> 01:09:31.066
PROPOSAL THAT THAT THEY HAD

01:09:31.133 --> 01:09:32.568
CONCERN ABOUT ON FEASIBLE

01:09:32.635 --> 01:09:34.603
TIMELINES ARE WITH REGARD TO

01:09:34.670 --> 01:09:36.338
THE RE OPENING PROPOSAL AND

01:09:36.405 --> 01:09:37.206
JUST IN THE LAST COUPLE OF

01:09:37.273 --> 01:09:39.141
DAYS. WE'VE HAD SOME BIG

01:09:39.208 --> 01:09:40.509
DISTRICTS INCLUDING THE LOS

01:09:40.576 --> 01:09:42.578
ANGELES UNIFIED THAT SAID THEY

01:09:42.645 --> 01:09:44.413
WILL NOT APPLY TO RE OPEN UNDER

01:09:44.480 --> 01:09:46.515
THE EXISTING DEADLINES I KNOW

01:09:46.582 --> 01:09:48.484
IN MY HOME COUNTY OF SANTA CRUZ

01:09:48.551 --> 01:09:49.552
IS THE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT

01:09:49.618 --> 01:09:51.687
ANNOUNCED THAT NONE OF THE

01:09:51.754 --> 01:09:53.722
DISTRICTS IN THE COUNTY FEEL

01:09:53.789 --> 01:09:55.190
THAT THIS WORKS FOR THEM AND

01:09:55.257 --> 01:09:57.159
THEY WILL NOT BE APPLYING. SO I

01:09:57.226 --> 01:09:59.461
WAS GONNA ASK FINANCE GIVEN THE

01:09:59.528 --> 01:10:01.497
L. A- SAYING THAT THEY THINK

01:10:01.564 --> 01:10:03.499
THAT DEADLINES ARE UNREASONABLE

01:10:03.566 --> 01:10:05.935
AND THE START OF SCHOOL

01:10:06.001 --> 01:10:07.236
DISTRICTS ACROSS THE STATE

01:10:07.303 --> 01:10:08.137
SAYING THEY'RE NOT GOING TO

01:10:08.203 --> 01:10:10.673
APPLY ARE YOU CONTEMPLATING

01:10:10.739 --> 01:10:14.176
ADJUSTING THE DEADLINES TO MAKE

01:10:14.243 --> 01:10:17.746
THIS PROGRAM WORK. THANK YOU

01:10:17.813 --> 01:10:18.814
FOR THAT QUESTION AND THE

01:10:18.881 --> 01:10:20.349
QUESTION THAT WE'VE RECEIVED

01:10:20.416 --> 01:10:22.484
QUITE A QUITE A BIT LATELY- I

01:10:22.551 --> 01:10:23.819
THINK THE TIMING OF IT IS

01:10:23.886 --> 01:10:26.055
OBVIOUSLY TO GET. KIDS BACK

01:10:26.121 --> 01:10:26.789
INTO SCHOOL TEACHERS BACK IN

01:10:26.855 --> 01:10:28.657
THE SCHOOL PRIOR TO THE END OF

01:10:28.724 --> 01:10:30.759
THE SCHOOL YEAR AND ULTIMATELY-

01:10:30.826 --> 01:10:33.696
HAVE. HAVE SIGNIFICANT TIME IN

01:10:33.762 --> 01:10:36.198
THE CLASSROOM- BUT IN REGARDS

01:10:36.265 --> 01:10:39.034
TO- THE ACTUAL TIMING OF THAT

01:10:39.101 --> 01:10:41.470
THAT'S ALL I WILL PASS THAT

01:10:41.537 --> 01:10:45.808
QUESTION TO JESSICA HOLMES. THE

01:10:45.874 --> 01:10:47.776
WHOLE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE-

01:10:47.843 --> 01:10:49.778
WE'VE RECEIVED FEEDBACK FROM

01:10:49.845 --> 01:10:51.447
MANY MANY ALLIGATORS YOU CAN

01:10:51.513 --> 01:10:53.649
IMAGINE ON THE PROPOSAL. AND I

01:10:53.716 --> 01:10:55.985
THINK THAT THE FEASIBILITY

01:10:56.051 --> 01:10:57.786
QUESTION AND IT'S REALLY

01:10:57.853 --> 01:11:00.723
DEPENDENT UPON THE DISTRICT.

01:11:00.789 --> 01:11:02.658
HOWEVER I WOULD ALSO BECAUSE IT

01:11:02.725 --> 01:11:04.493
THAT FIRST TIME I THINK WHO ARE

01:11:04.560 --> 01:11:06.028
PLANNING ON NOT APPLYING IT AND

01:11:06.095 --> 01:11:07.830
NOT AS MUCH OF THE TIME LINE

01:11:07.896 --> 01:11:09.164
ISSUE AS THERE ARE SOME OTHER

01:11:09.231 --> 01:11:10.399
ISSUES THAT THOSE DISTRICTS ARE

01:11:10.466 --> 01:11:12.167
FACING AND WE'RE CERTAINLY-

01:11:12.234 --> 01:11:13.369
TALKED WITH THEM TO TRY TO

01:11:13.435 --> 01:11:14.637
UNDERSTAND BETTER WHAT THEIR

01:11:14.703 --> 01:11:17.139
CONCERNS ARE. BUT BUT IN TERMS

01:11:17.206 --> 01:11:18.841
OF PINING WE DO HAVE TWO

01:11:18.907 --> 01:11:20.509
OPTIONS FOR SCHOOL DISTRICT ONE

01:11:20.576 --> 01:11:21.810
OF AN APPLICATION BY FEBRUARY

01:11:21.877 --> 01:11:22.911
FIRST THE OTHER THING

01:11:22.978 --> 01:11:24.546
APPLICATION BY MARCH FIRST IN

01:11:24.613 --> 01:11:26.148
RECOGNITION OF THE FACT THAT IT

01:11:26.215 --> 01:11:27.783
WILL TAKE. A LITTLE BIT MORE

01:11:27.850 --> 01:11:29.351
TIME TO GET THE THINGS IN PLACE

01:11:29.418 --> 01:11:30.552
THAT THEY NEED IN ORDER TO

01:11:30.619 --> 01:11:33.422
REOPEN. I THINK THE OTHER THING

01:11:33.489 --> 01:11:34.223
THAT WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT IS.

01:11:34.289 --> 01:11:35.791
YOU KNOW TO THE EXTENT THAT

01:11:35.858 --> 01:11:37.593
MONEY ENSURE THAT FOLKS ARE

01:11:37.660 --> 01:11:40.362
OPEN FOR IN PERSON INSTRUCTION-

01:11:40.429 --> 01:11:41.497
YOU KNOW. NOT ONLY IN THE

01:11:41.563 --> 01:11:43.399
FISCAL YEAR BUT IN THE FALL.

01:11:43.465 --> 01:11:44.466
THAT NEITHER EARLY AGE REALLY

01:11:44.533 --> 01:11:45.467
NEED TO START MAKING THOSE

01:11:45.534 --> 01:11:46.935
PLANS AND FIGURE OUT WHAT

01:11:47.002 --> 01:11:48.537
THEY'RE GOING TO DO NOW-

01:11:48.604 --> 01:11:50.406
BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT YOU KNOW

01:11:50.472 --> 01:11:51.974
DEPEND ON MAKING GOING TO IT'S

01:11:52.041 --> 01:11:53.776
GOING WE'RE GONNA BE

01:11:53.842 --> 01:11:54.276
TRANSITIONING OUT OF THE

01:11:54.343 --> 01:11:55.544
PANDEMIC. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE

01:11:55.611 --> 01:11:56.512
THAT THOSE VALUES ARE PREPARED

01:11:56.578 --> 01:11:58.781
WELL SO WE ARE ALL. I'M HAVING

01:11:58.847 --> 01:12:00.015
CONVERSATIONS WITH THE FOLKS

01:12:00.082 --> 01:12:01.216
WHO REACHED OUT TO TRY TO

01:12:01.283 --> 01:12:02.618
UNDERSTAND THEIR CONCERN BUT

01:12:02.685 --> 01:12:04.353
ALSO TO ENCOURAGE THEM. BACKING

01:12:04.420 --> 01:12:05.521
A REGARDLESS OF WHEN YOU THINK

01:12:05.587 --> 01:12:06.488
YOU'RE GOING TO RE OPEN NOW

01:12:06.555 --> 01:12:07.790
IT'S TIME TO START PLANNING FOR

01:12:07.856 --> 01:12:09.224
THAT TO ENSURE THAT KIDS CAN

01:12:09.291 --> 01:12:11.293
ACT WITH THAT. YOU KNOW IN THE

01:12:11.360 --> 01:12:12.594
CURRENT YEAR IN THE FALL. BUT

01:12:12.661 --> 01:12:14.630
THE CURRENT PROPOSAL JUST. A

01:12:14.697 --> 01:12:16.365
CONTEMPLATES RE OPENING IN THE

01:12:16.432 --> 01:12:18.734
NEXT TWO MONTHS AND- ISN'T

01:12:18.801 --> 01:12:20.536
NECESSARILY REWARDING PEOPLE

01:12:20.602 --> 01:12:23.238
THAT MIGHT BE MAKING SURE THEY

01:12:23.305 --> 01:12:24.473
RE OPEN IN THE FALL AND I

01:12:24.540 --> 01:12:26.375
THINK. ONE OF THE CONCERNS

01:12:26.442 --> 01:12:29.378
THAT'S COME UP. IS THAT.

01:12:29.445 --> 01:12:30.779
TEACHERS AND CLASSIFIED

01:12:30.846 --> 01:12:32.948
EMPLOYEES WANT TO BE VACCINATED

01:12:33.015 --> 01:12:33.682
BEFORE THEY GO IN THE

01:12:33.749 --> 01:12:36.719
CLASSROOM. AND RIGHT NOW THE

01:12:36.785 --> 01:12:38.320
SCHEDULE DOESN'T SYNC UP

01:12:38.387 --> 01:12:40.189
TOTALLY WITH THE ABILITY TO BE

01:12:40.255 --> 01:12:47.796
VACCINATED. SO IF THESE

01:12:47.863 --> 01:12:48.664
TIMELINE SLIP TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:12:48.731 --> 01:12:50.332
SCHOOLS DO IT IT ALSO ALLOWS.

01:12:50.399 --> 01:12:51.266

01:12:51.333 --> 01:12:52.735
AND THAT IS VERY AND- JUST SO

01:12:52.801 --> 01:12:53.702
THE I DON'T. THIS ONE LINE

01:12:53.769 --> 01:12:56.472
QUESTION. AND THEN THAT HAS TO

01:12:56.538 --> 01:12:58.474
DO WITH THE TIME LINES THAT YOU

01:12:58.540 --> 01:13:01.143
JUST SAID BECAUSE ANECDOTALLY.

01:13:01.210 --> 01:13:03.712
IT APPEARS THAT SCHOOLS THAT

01:13:03.779 --> 01:13:05.214
MIGHT BE ABLE TO APPLY RIGHT

01:13:05.280 --> 01:13:07.983
AWAY. OR MORE WELL TO DO FOR

01:13:08.050 --> 01:13:09.618

01:13:09.685 --> 01:13:11.253
SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT REPRESENT

01:13:11.320 --> 01:13:13.188

THAT THEIR FARTHER BACK IN LINE

01:13:17.392 --> 01:13:18.660
AND WOULD GET LESS MONEY UNDER

01:13:18.727 --> 01:13:19.762
THE CURRENT THINGS EVEN IF THE

01:13:19.828 --> 01:13:21.530
DEADLINES HOLD. THE GOVERNOR

01:13:21.597 --> 01:13:23.298
SAID AT HIS PRESS CONFERENCE

01:13:23.365 --> 01:13:25.067
THAT HE WANTS TO MAKE SURE.

01:13:25.134 --> 01:13:27.269
NOBODY IS DISADVANTAGED BASED

01:13:27.336 --> 01:13:29.071
ON THEIR ECONOMIC STATUS AS

01:13:29.138 --> 01:13:30.239

DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT THE

01:15:39.167 --> 01:15:44.139
BUCKLE. AT THIS IS A MASSIVE

01:15:44.206 --> 01:15:47.276
HISTORIC CONSEQUENCE. AND FOR

TO BE HELPFUL BUT ONE THING

01:15:57.452 --> 01:15:59.121
THAT CERTAINLY WOULD BE HELPFUL

01:15:59.187 --> 01:16:00.789
TO THE CANS OF THOUSANDS OF

01:16:00.856 --> 01:16:02.824
CALIFORNIANS WHO HAVE BEEN

01:16:02.891 --> 01:16:05.727
AGREED TO BY THE INABILITY OF

01:16:05.794 --> 01:16:08.563

01:16:08.630 --> 01:16:10.899
NOTWITHSTANDING WHATEVER HAS

01:16:10.966 --> 01:16:13.902
BEEN ATTEMPTED SO FAR. I DIDN'T

01:16:13.969 --> 01:16:16.271
SAY DONE I SAID IT KEPT IT. TO

01:16:16.338 --> 01:16:18.273

SAME VOLUME OF COMPLAINTS FROM

01:16:22.110 --> 01:16:26.848
OUR CITIZENS. AND UNEMPLOYMENT.

01:16:26.915 --> 01:16:28.884

01:16:28.951 --> 01:16:29.384
AMOUNT OF MONEY INTO THE

01:16:29.451 --> 01:16:35.824
POCKETS. BUT MAYBE CALIFORNIANS.

01:16:35.891 --> 01:16:40.262
AND DEPENDING ON FEDERAL HELP.

01:16:40.329 --> 01:16:42.097
IT'S KIND OF A HOLLOW PROMISE

01:16:42.164 --> 01:16:45.200
SO THE QUESTION TO FINANCE WHAT.

01:16:45.267 --> 01:16:47.769
KIND OF CHANGES BY BEING

01:16:47.836 --> 01:16:52.708

HELLO THIS SPECIFICALLY GIVEN

01:16:54.343 --> 01:16:56.712
EXAMPLE WHAT'S PROVOKED A LOT

01:16:56.778 --> 01:17:02.150
OF MY ANGST HERE. EARLY ON THE-

01:17:02.217 --> 01:17:05.354
REMEDY WAS TO TRANSFER NOW FROM

01:17:05.420 --> 01:17:06.989
OTHER AGENCIES AND TO. EIGHTY

01:17:07.055 --> 01:17:10.625
DATE. BUT THAT DIDN'T HELP MUCH

01:17:10.692 --> 01:17:11.760
BECAUSE THEY FOUND THOSE

01:17:11.827 --> 01:17:13.762
INDIVIDUALS HAD TO BE TRAINED.

01:17:13.829 --> 01:17:15.964
AND TO TRAIN THEM. THEY HAD TO

01:17:16.031 --> 01:17:17.632
TAKETHE INDIVIDUALS WHO WORK

01:17:17.699 --> 01:17:20.502
TRAINED OFF THEIR DUTY. THE

01:17:20.569 --> 01:17:24.539
BILL TRYING. THAT HAS CERTAINLY

01:17:24.606 --> 01:17:27.409

CHANGES TOP TO BOTTOM IN THAT

01:17:32.381 --> 01:17:35.283
ORGANIZATION. ARE GOING TO BE

01:17:35.350 --> 01:17:38.120
PROPOSED. AND I SUGGEST THAT WE

01:17:38.186 --> 01:17:40.756
THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD IN OUR

01:17:40.822 --> 01:17:44.126

01:17:55.404 --> 01:17:57.339
PAIN POINT FOR MANY MANY PEOPLE

OVERWHELMING AND I THINK THAT

01:18:07.249 --> 01:18:10.619
EDT AND UNEXPECTED- THERE WERE

01:18:10.685 --> 01:18:11.820
A LOT OF THINGS THAT WERE DONE

01:18:11.887 --> 01:18:13.722
TO PROVIDE RESOURCES TO BEEF UP

01:18:13.789 --> 01:18:15.390

REDIRECTION OF RESOURCES AS YOU

MENTIONED INCLUDING HIRING- AND

01:18:20.295 --> 01:18:21.997

01:18:32.374 --> 01:18:34.476
WAS A DIFFICULT SITUATION. AND

01:18:34.543 --> 01:18:36.078
NO EXCUSES BUT THE WORKLOAD WAS

01:18:36.144 --> 01:18:38.313
CRASHING- SINCE THEN THERE HAVE

01:18:38.380 --> 01:18:42.384

IN IN THE PEE WEE PROGRAM IN

01:18:44.352 --> 01:18:45.587

NOW SO THAT THEY COULD DEAL

01:19:52.954 --> 01:19:55.557
WITH THE CURRENT PROBLEMS BUT

01:19:55.624 --> 01:19:57.259
MORE OBVIOUSLY NEEDS TO BE DONE

TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE MORE

01:24:25.126 --> 01:24:27.228
SPECIFIC ELEMENTS OF WHAT THIS

01:24:27.295 --> 01:24:29.631
IS GOING TO BE. MY FUNDAMENTAL

01:24:29.697 --> 01:24:31.132
POINT AND IT FLIES TO ALL

01:24:31.199 --> 01:24:34.302
AGENCIES IT IS THE LEGISLATURE

01:24:34.369 --> 01:24:35.703
CANNOT BE PASSING THIS BUDGET.

01:24:35.770 --> 01:24:38.139
AND NOT BE VERY INSTRUCTIVE AND

01:24:38.206 --> 01:24:40.241
EXPLICITLY SO IF YOU WILL

01:24:40.308 --> 01:24:42.811
MANDATING OF THE ADMINISTRATION

01:24:42.877 --> 01:24:44.179
TO DO THIS THAT OR THE OTHER

01:24:44.245 --> 01:24:45.480
THING IN OTHER WORDS I DON'T

01:24:45.547 --> 01:24:47.248
WANT TO GIVE A BUNCH OF MONEY

01:24:47.315 --> 01:24:50.885
FOR FIRE. PREVENTION AND LET

01:24:50.952 --> 01:24:51.786
THE AGENCIES FIGURE OUT HOW TO

01:24:51.853 --> 01:24:53.955
SPEND. WE FOUND THAT THAT DID

01:24:54.022 --> 01:24:55.723
NOT WORK WHEN WE HAD THE FIRE

01:24:55.790 --> 01:24:58.560
TAX YEARS AGO. THE MONEY DIDN'T

01:24:58.626 --> 01:25:00.462
GO WHERE IT SHOULD HAVE. IT WAS

01:25:00.528 --> 01:25:04.666
A FAILURE. IT WAS NOT RENEWED

01:25:04.732 --> 01:25:05.900
BECAUSE IT WAS A FAVORITE WE DO

01:25:05.967 --> 01:25:08.803
A LOT OF IN THAT PATH AGAIN SO-

01:25:08.870 --> 01:25:10.638
LET'S JUST TRY TO GET BACK AND

01:25:10.705 --> 01:25:12.240
TALK SOME VERY SPECIFICS ABOUT

01:25:12.307 --> 01:25:13.341
THIS SO WE CAN DEAL WITH THAT

01:25:13.408 --> 01:25:15.176
AND THE SUBCOMMITTEE TO MORE

01:25:15.243 --> 01:25:16.144
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO TAKE

01:25:16.211 --> 01:25:17.779
TOO MUCH OF. ALL THE OTHER

01:25:17.846 --> 01:25:20.482
MEMBERS TIME I MAY HAVE SOME

01:25:20.548 --> 01:25:21.883
QUESTIONS LATER THE- LET'S TALK

01:25:21.950 --> 01:25:23.184
ABOUT EDUCATION JUST A MINUTE

01:25:23.251 --> 01:25:27.222
NOW. IT WAS A LITTLE CONCERNED

01:25:27.288 --> 01:25:28.656
ABOUT THE GENTLEMAN FROM THE

01:25:28.723 --> 01:25:30.892
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TALKING

01:25:30.959 --> 01:25:33.094
ABOUT DISTANT EDUCATION. AND

01:25:33.161 --> 01:25:34.429
FOR SOME OF OUR CILDREN THAT'S

01:25:34.496 --> 01:25:35.797
GOOD FOR SOME OF OUR CHILDREN

01:25:35.864 --> 01:25:40.401
THAT'S BAD. WHAT I'VE HEARD. IS

01:25:40.468 --> 01:25:44.873
THAT FOR MOST CHILDREN IT'S BAD.

01:25:44.939 --> 01:25:46.140
AND AT LEAST WE SHOULD BE

01:25:46.207 --> 01:25:48.343
GETTING BACK INTO OUR SCHOOL

01:25:48.409 --> 01:25:50.111
FACILITIES AS SOON AS WE CAN

01:25:50.178 --> 01:25:50.912
AND CERTAINLY THERE ARE

01:25:50.979 --> 01:25:53.314
LIMITATIONS IN CVS DOMINATING

01:25:53.381 --> 01:25:54.749
IN THE HEALTH OF OUR CHILDREN

01:25:54.816 --> 01:25:57.619
IS MOST IMPORTANT. BUT I DON'T

01:25:57.685 --> 01:26:00.288
THINK DISTANCE LEARNING IS THE

01:26:00.355 --> 01:26:02.757
WAY WE NEED TO GO IN THE FUTURE.

01:26:02.824 --> 01:26:04.626
AND WE ARE A CONSTRAINT AS MUCH

01:26:04.692 --> 01:26:08.429
AS WE CAN. FOR THE SCHOOL

01:26:08.496 --> 01:26:11.132
DISTRICT. THIS DISTANT LEARNING

01:26:11.199 --> 01:26:12.467
I WOULD IMAGINE IS GOING TO

01:26:12.534 --> 01:26:14.536
REQUIRE SOME CAPITAL OUTLAY

01:26:14.602 --> 01:26:16.704
EXPENDITURES. FOR NECESSARY

01:26:16.771 --> 01:26:19.974
EQUIPMENT. CAN ANYONE AND

01:26:20.041 --> 01:26:22.343
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TELL ME

01:26:22.410 --> 01:26:25.280

YOU'RE DOING. BUT THEN ANOTHER

01:26:33.421 --> 01:26:35.023
SPECIFIC QUESTION AND NOW THIS

01:32:26.173 --> 01:32:29.577
KNOWLEDGES THAT THE RECOVERY

01:32:29.644 --> 01:32:31.712

01:32:31.779 --> 01:32:35.182
TRUE IN DISTRICTS LIKE MY OWN.

FEW OTHER THINGS ARE ARE REALLY

01:32:40.655 --> 01:32:44.058
IMPORTANT TO MAKE THAT POINT-%

01:32:44.125 --> 01:32:47.361
LOW PAID WORKERS WORKING IN-

01:32:47.428 --> 01:32:49.563

01:32:53.601 --> 01:32:56.037
HIT. FOR MANY OF THEM THERE'S

01:32:56.103 --> 01:32:58.205
NO SAFETY NET. THE MAJORITY ARE

01:32:58.272 --> 01:33:00.508
PEOPLE OF COLOR IN THESE LOW

01:33:00.574 --> 01:33:04.779
PAID JOBS- PLAN IMPLIED BECAUSE

THEY CAN'T WORK FROM HOME-

01:33:06.447 --> 01:33:08.382
HARDEST HIT BECAUSE THEIR

01:33:08.449 --> 01:33:09.317
CHILDREN DIDN'T HAVE THE

01:33:09.383 --> 01:33:13.220
CONNECTIVITY IN THE DEVICES-

01:33:13.287 --> 01:33:14.689
AND THEN MY PARTICULAR- THERE

01:33:14.755 --> 01:33:17.758
ARE SAID TO BE ONE OUT OF THREE

01:33:17.825 --> 01:33:19.593
EVENTUALLY KNOWS. WHO ARE

01:33:19.660 --> 01:33:24.165
POSITIVE. HOMELESSNESS GROWING

01:33:24.231 --> 01:33:26.334
ENORMOUSLY AND HUNDREDS OF

01:33:26.400 --> 01:33:31.138
THOUSANDS. OF RENTERS WHO RUN

01:33:31.205 --> 01:33:33.808
THE RISK OF BECOMING HOMELESS.

01:33:33.874 --> 01:33:36.377
BUT THERE'S ONE IN PARTICULAR

01:33:36.444 --> 01:33:38.212
ONE GROUP IN PARTICULAR- THAT

01:33:38.279 --> 01:33:40.581
WORRIES ME THE MOST AND MANY OF

01:33:40.648 --> 01:33:41.549
US THE MOST AND THAT IS OUR

01:33:41.615 --> 01:33:44.618
SENIORS. MOST VULNERABLE WHEN

01:33:44.685 --> 01:33:46.520
THEY CAME TO THE PANDEMIC MOST

01:33:46.587 --> 01:33:49.690
VULNERABLE WHEN IT COMES TO

01:33:49.757 --> 01:33:51.425
THEIR LEVEL OF POVERTY. AND

01:33:51.492 --> 01:33:53.894
MOST VULNERABLE IF THEY ARE

01:33:53.961 --> 01:33:57.732
UNDOCUMENTED- IN C. JANUARY OF

01:33:57.798 --> 01:34:00.368
TWENTY TWENTY. THE GOVERNOR HAD

01:34:00.434 --> 01:34:03.070
IN THE PROPOSED INCLUDING

01:34:03.137 --> 01:34:04.705

UNDOCUMENTED SENIORS THAT LOW

01:34:06.807 --> 01:34:08.709
INCOME UNDOCUMENTED SENIORS WHO

ECONOMY AND TO OUR STATE FOR

01:34:13.180 --> 01:34:16.984
MANY MANY YEARS AND- BECAUSE OF

01:34:17.051 --> 01:34:20.554
THE PANDEMIC THAT WAS TAKEN OFF

01:34:20.621 --> 01:34:21.489
THE TABLE. AW AND SO MY

01:34:21.555 --> 01:34:24.425
QUESTION IS BECAUSE OF THE

01:34:24.492 --> 01:34:26.861
IMPACT OF THE PANDEMIC IN

01:34:26.927 --> 01:34:30.197

THE ADMINISTRATION EXPLAIN

01:34:32.867 --> 01:34:36.003
LEAVING THESE VULNERABLE. THIS

01:34:36.070 --> 01:34:37.838
VULNERABLE POPULATION WHICH IS

01:34:37.905 --> 01:34:40.107
APPROXIMATELY THIRTY THOUSAND

01:34:40.174 --> 01:34:42.376
ACROSS THE STATE WITH OUR

01:34:42.443 --> 01:34:45.012
HEALTH CARE COVERAGE. OF AND

01:34:45.079 --> 01:34:46.747
ESPECIALLY BECAUSE OF THE

01:34:46.814 --> 01:34:48.783
GOVERNOR'S CONCERN FOR OUR MOST

01:34:48.849 --> 01:34:52.286
VULNERABLE AND BECAUSE WE HAD-

01:34:52.353 --> 01:34:54.855
HE HAD MADE THE COMMITMENT TO

01:34:54.922 --> 01:34:56.857
THIS EXPANSION TO INCLUDE THEM

01:34:56.924 --> 01:34:59.794
UP PRIOR I UNDERSTAND AND I

01:34:59.860 --> 01:35:01.362
SOMEWHAT EXPECTED I DON'T MEAN

01:35:01.429 --> 01:35:04.131
TO PUT WORDS IN ANYBODY'S MOUTH

01:35:04.198 --> 01:35:05.433
AND DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE BUT-

01:35:05.499 --> 01:35:07.268

01:36:14.401 --> 01:36:16.403
COME TO UNDERSTANDING. AND

01:36:16.470 --> 01:36:18.839
AGREEMENT AT THE END- THAT

01:36:18.906 --> 01:36:22.543
REFLECTS- OUR OVERALL-

01:36:22.610 --> 01:36:26.480
PRIORITIES SO- THAT IS MARGIN

01:36:26.547 --> 01:36:28.582
STATE I THINK BUT- IN LINE WITH

01:36:28.649 --> 01:36:30.584
WHAT YOU SAID IT THIS IS NOT IS

01:36:30.651 --> 01:36:32.753
A NEW. AND THERE WILL BE BACK

01:36:32.820 --> 01:36:35.022
IN AND I'M THEIR MANY. THAT WE

01:36:35.089 --> 01:36:38.225
WOULD LIKE TO- SUPPORT THAT WE

01:36:38.292 --> 01:36:41.529
CAN'T AFFORD TO SUPPORT AT THIS

01:36:41.595 --> 01:36:42.997
POINT. WELL I THINK IT A MATTER

01:36:43.063 --> 01:36:43.931
OF WHAT THE PRIORITIES ARE AND

01:36:43.998 --> 01:36:45.232
I UNDERSTAND SO I THINK THE

01:36:45.299 --> 01:36:46.800
QUESTION THE CONVERSATION WILL

01:36:46.867 --> 01:36:51.605
BE ABOUT- WHAT ARE THE- WHAT

01:36:51.672 --> 01:36:53.207
MAKES YOU DECIDE THAT CERTAIN

01:36:53.274 --> 01:36:54.475
THINGS ARE PRIORITY OVER

01:36:54.542 --> 01:36:55.776
SOMETHING ELSE LIKE I SAID

01:36:55.843 --> 01:36:57.678
ESPECIALLY WITH REGARDS TO. OUR

01:36:57.745 --> 01:37:00.080
SENIORS- WHO NEED THAT

01:37:00.147 --> 01:37:02.016
PREVENTATIVE PRIMARY CARE SO

01:37:02.082 --> 01:37:04.018
THAT THEY AREN'T THE MOST

01:37:04.084 --> 01:37:06.320
VULNERABLE AND HIT THE HARDEST-

01:37:06.387 --> 01:37:08.689
I THINK ANOTHER AREA THAT THE-

01:37:08.756 --> 01:37:11.825
PLAN MINISTRATIONS- PROPOSAL-

01:37:11.892 --> 01:37:14.261
IS- EMPHASIZING IS JOB

01:37:14.328 --> 01:37:17.298
CREATION. AND I JUST WANT TO GO

01:37:17.364 --> 01:37:18.499
TO THE ISSUE OF THE CHALCONE

01:37:18.566 --> 01:37:23.137
PETE'S TAX CREDIT- EXPANSION-

01:37:23.204 --> 01:37:27.208
IT YOU KNOW IT MIGHT. UNDER IS

01:37:27.274 --> 01:37:29.777
OF RECENT KALKA BEATS TAX

01:37:29.843 --> 01:37:32.112
CREDIT RECIPIENTS ARE HIGHLY

01:37:32.179 --> 01:37:34.215
CAPITALIZED COMPANIES SUCH AS

01:37:34.281 --> 01:37:36.784
LUCID MOTORS HONDA NORTHRUP.

01:37:36.850 --> 01:37:38.953
GRUMMOND THAT DON'T NECESSARILY

01:37:39.019 --> 01:37:40.988
NEED THE MONEY. SO HOW DO WE

01:37:41.055 --> 01:37:43.090
TARGET OR PRIORITIZE A TAX

01:37:43.157 --> 01:37:44.758
CREDIT FOR COMPANIES FOR

01:37:44.825 --> 01:37:46.927
EXAMPLE THAT HAVE GONE THROUGH

01:37:46.994 --> 01:37:48.696
LAYOFFS AND THEREFORE. THEY

01:37:48.762 --> 01:37:50.931
WOULD BE BRINGING BACK WORKERS

01:37:50.998 --> 01:37:53.467
OR COMPANIES THAT ARE COMMITTED

01:37:53.534 --> 01:37:55.269
TO GOOD PAYING JOBS BECAUSE

01:37:55.336 --> 01:37:57.037
LORD KNOWS THAT IN CALIFORNIA

01:37:57.104 --> 01:38:01.275
WE HAVE. MILLIONS OF LITTLE.

01:38:01.342 --> 01:38:03.844
PAID NO WAY PAID JOBS AND THAT

01:38:03.911 --> 01:38:07.047
DOESN'T OUR ANY GOOD WHAT'S- WE

01:38:07.114 --> 01:38:10.918
HAVE TO A- BIG YOU KNOW THE OUT

01:38:10.985 --> 01:38:13.387
HOW TO SUBS. THE EMPLOYER IN

01:38:13.454 --> 01:38:20.127
THOSE CASES- SO I ONE- TO THE

01:38:20.194 --> 01:38:21.395
IF YOU COULD ADD THAT. HOW DO

01:38:21.462 --> 01:38:23.330
WE SURE THAT THESE TAX CREDIT

01:38:23.397 --> 01:38:25.065
WHEN WE'RE LOOKING TO EXPAND

01:38:25.132 --> 01:38:27.935
IT- FOUR TO A HUNDRED EIGHTY

01:38:28.002 --> 01:38:30.304
MILLION DOLLARS. HOW DO WE MAKE

01:38:30.371 --> 01:38:32.039
SURE THAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY

01:38:32.106 --> 01:38:34.942
GOING TO DO SOME GOOD. WITH

01:38:35.009 --> 01:38:38.345
THOSE TAX DOLLARS. YES AND AS

01:38:38.412 --> 01:38:39.847
YOU MENTIONED THE CAL COMPETE

01:38:39.913 --> 01:38:41.882
EXPANSION IS FOUR NINETY

01:38:41.949 --> 01:38:42.650
MILLION IN THE CURRENT YEAR AND

01:38:42.716 --> 01:38:43.917
ANOTHER NINETY MILLION BUDGET

01:38:43.984 --> 01:38:46.020
YEAR THERE'S ALSO TWO HUNDRED

01:38:46.086 --> 01:38:47.888
FIFTY MILLION AND A NEW GRANTS

01:38:47.955 --> 01:38:49.089
PROGRAM THROUGH CAL COMPETE.

01:38:49.156 --> 01:38:50.624
THAT SHOULD REALLY OPEN UP THE

01:38:50.691 --> 01:38:51.925
FIELD SO THAT MORE BUSINESSES

01:38:51.992 --> 01:38:53.294
THAT WOULD NOT OTHERWISE NOT

01:38:53.360 --> 01:38:56.163
HAVE APPLIED- CAN IT NOW

01:38:56.230 --> 01:38:58.098
BECAUSE THESE OF THE STATE THEY

01:38:58.165 --> 01:39:00.868
HAD LITTLE TAX PLAY- AMONG

01:39:00.934 --> 01:39:03.137
THINGS AND SO THE IDEA IS TO-

01:39:03.203 --> 01:39:05.839
REALLY X. THE CREDITS AND THE

01:39:05.906 --> 01:39:06.440
GRANTS THAT ARE- OUT THERE SO

01:39:06.507 --> 01:39:08.976
THAT. BUSINESS CANNOT TO SUCH A

01:39:09.043 --> 01:39:12.179
YOU MIGHT YOU- WHO MAKE ARE THE

01:39:12.246 --> 01:39:20.988
SMALLER- ALL ARE MOM AND POP

ELDERLY WHICH I BELIEVE IS

01:49:32.732 --> 01:49:34.601
TRUE. BUT WE ALSO HAVE OUR

01:49:34.668 --> 01:49:36.636
YOUNG FOLKS WHO. HAVE BEEN

01:49:36.703 --> 01:49:39.039

01:49:39.105 --> 01:49:41.875
AS A FATHER OF. THREE CHILDREN

01:49:41.942 --> 01:49:43.677
THAT ARE STILL ATTENDING TO IN

01:49:43.743 --> 01:49:46.112
COLLEGE AND ONE. IN MIDDLE

01:49:53.853 --> 01:49:55.655
SCHOOL NO DOUBT THEY NEED TO BE

01:49:55.722 --> 01:49:58.825
IT. LEARNING IN SCHOOL- BUT ONE

01:49:58.892 --> 01:49:59.426
OF THE PROBLEMS THAT WE HAVE

01:49:59.492 --> 01:50:00.794
WITH DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES

01:50:00.860 --> 01:50:02.495
SUCH AS- THE A BIG PART OF MY

01:50:02.562 --> 01:50:04.698
DISTRICT IS. BROADBAND NOW I

01:50:04.764 --> 01:50:06.900
KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF FEDERAL

01:50:06.967 --> 01:50:09.869
MONEY. THAT HAS BEEN- ALLOCATED

01:50:09.936 --> 01:50:11.604
TO BROADBAND BUT- AND WE'VE

01:50:11.671 --> 01:50:12.906
DONE LEGISLATION I'VE ACTUALLY

01:50:12.973 --> 01:50:14.541
WORKED ON IT MYSELF. BUT AT THE

01:50:14.607 --> 01:50:16.743
END OF THE DAY- IT IS A QUICK

01:50:16.810 --> 01:50:18.778
ENOUGH. THE BY THE TIME YOU

01:50:18.845 --> 01:50:21.014
BUILD THE INFRASTRUCTURE- TO

01:50:21.081 --> 01:50:22.315
GET WHERE WE'RE GOING THESE

01:50:22.382 --> 01:50:24.217
WE'VE LOST THESE KIDS- SO I

01:50:24.284 --> 01:50:26.152
WOULD I WOULD JUST. SHARE THAT

01:50:26.219 --> 01:50:27.220
I THINK THERE'S MAYBE SOME

01:50:27.287 --> 01:50:28.288
OPPORTUNITIES AND MAYBE A

01:50:28.355 --> 01:50:30.156
VOUCHER PROGRAM OR ACTUALLY

01:50:30.223 --> 01:50:32.392
HELP SOME OF THESE. PARENTS PAY

01:50:32.459 --> 01:50:34.327
FOR THEIR INTERNET- SO THEIR

01:50:34.394 --> 01:50:35.562
KIDS CAN ACTUALLY DISTANCE

01:50:35.628 --> 01:50:38.031
LEARN IN THESE AREAS WHERE THEY

01:50:38.098 --> 01:50:39.065
DON'T HAVE. A PERSONAL THEIR

01:50:39.132 --> 01:50:40.567
DISADVANTAGE IN THIS IS NOT

01:50:40.633 --> 01:50:44.537
JUST FOR RULERS. THIS IS FOR.

01:50:44.604 --> 01:50:45.538
PEOPLE THAT ARE. EVEN HAVE

01:50:45.605 --> 01:50:47.107
ACCESS DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY

01:50:47.173 --> 01:50:47.741
TO. PURCHASE IT WE SHOULD LOOK

01:50:47.807 --> 01:50:49.376
AT A VOUCHER PROGRAM- MAYBE RUN

01:50:49.442 --> 01:50:50.310
IT THROUGH THE SCHOOL SO THAT

01:50:50.377 --> 01:50:53.480
WE CAN. ALLOW THESE. STUDENTS

01:50:53.546 --> 01:50:55.048
TO A DISTANCE LEARN SO THAT'S

01:50:55.115 --> 01:50:56.683
ONE OF THE THINGS THT I.

01:50:56.750 --> 01:50:57.717
REALLY WOULD THINK WE SHOULD

01:50:57.784 --> 01:51:00.020
FOCUS ON. AS OUR IS THAT

01:51:00.086 --> 01:51:02.655

01:59:52.752 --> 01:59:55.154
ASKING ABOUT. WHETHER OR NOT-

01:59:55.221 --> 01:59:56.656
THE STIMULUS DOLLARS PROSUMER

01:59:56.722 --> 01:59:59.225

01:59:59.292 --> 02:00:01.327
BE DEPLOYED- IN IN TERMS OF

02:00:01.394 --> 02:00:03.596
SOME OF THE- MEDIATION TYPE

02:00:03.663 --> 02:00:04.630
WORK THAT WE WERE BOTH JUST

02:00:04.697 --> 02:00:07.533
TALKING ABOUT IS. IS JUST-

02:00:07.600 --> 02:00:09.502
STILL UNRESOLVED IN MY MIND SO-

02:00:09.569 --> 02:00:10.770
ITSELF DOESN'T SOUND LIKE

02:00:10.836 --> 02:00:11.837
YOU'RE TOO WORRIED ABOUT WHERE

02:00:11.904 --> 02:00:14.173
THE MONEY'S GONNA COME FROM SO-

02:00:14.240 --> 02:00:16.409
MAYBE THAT'S A NON ISSUE BUT-

02:00:16.475 --> 02:00:22.682
THANKS I'M STILL ON RESULT. ON

02:00:22.748 --> 02:00:23.683

02:00:23.749 --> 02:00:26.285
OF THE RISK. OF IS THERE A

02:00:26.352 --> 02:00:27.853
GONNA PULL BACK. MAYBE TO

02:00:27.920 --> 02:00:30.523
THIRTY THOUSAND FEET HERE- IN.

02:00:30.590 --> 02:00:31.857
BERMAN **** BECAUSE SIMPLY WITH

02:00:31.924 --> 02:00:35.394
REGARD TO TOO COLD A- NOT NOT

02:00:35.461 --> 02:00:36.395
ANYTHING ELSE IN OTHER WORDS I

02:00:36.462 --> 02:00:39.498
DON'T NEED A HI NEW HERE BUT I

02:00:39.565 --> 02:00:40.066
DON'T THINK I NEED A CIVICS

02:00:40.132 --> 02:00:41.767
LESSON ON- THAT'S

02:00:41.834 --> 02:00:42.368
RESPONSIBILITY FOR

02:00:42.435 --> 02:00:43.469

02:00:51.577 --> 02:00:55.281
QUESTION IN MY MIND. AS TO. YOU

02:00:55.348 --> 02:00:57.516
KNOW WHERE THE LINE IS DRAWN-

02:00:57.583 --> 02:00:59.352
AS WE PROCEED ON THIS BUDGET

02:00:59.418 --> 02:01:02.121
PATH. BETWEEN WHAT REMAINS THE

02:01:02.188 --> 02:01:02.688
RESPONSIBILITY OF THE

02:01:02.755 --> 02:01:06.225
LEGISLATURE. OF VERSES OF WHAT.

02:01:06.292 --> 02:01:09.228
CLEARLY FALLS IN. THE CATEGORY

02:01:09.295 --> 02:01:11.263
OF EMERGENCY EXECUTIVE POWERS

02:01:11.330 --> 02:01:12.999
FOR PUBLIC HEALTH POWERS. OF

02:01:13.065 --> 02:01:14.200
FOR EXAMPLE ISSUES AROUND

AROUND- DEPLOYMENT FOR

02:01:20.473 --> 02:01:22.074
COMMUNITIES OF CONCERN WOULD

02:01:22.141 --> 02:01:23.876
WOULD SEEM TO ME TO BE

02:01:23.943 --> 02:01:26.212
LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES THE

02:01:26.278 --> 02:01:27.747
POLICY QUESTIONS FOR THE

02:01:27.813 --> 02:01:30.449
LEGISLATURE- YOUR RESPECTIVE OF

02:01:30.516 --> 02:01:32.852

THOSE DOLLARS FOR MERCY

02:01:34.020 --> 02:01:36.622
PURPOSES- IN THE LARGER SCHEME

02:01:36.689 --> 02:01:37.790

02:01:37.857 --> 02:01:40.626
FROM THE L. A. O. WITH I HAVE

02:01:40.693 --> 02:01:41.727
TO BELIEVE AT SOME POINT

02:01:41.794 --> 02:01:43.462
SOMEBODY IN THE ALEJO'S OFFICE

02:01:43.529 --> 02:01:45.665
SAT DOWN AND STARTED TO. CHECK

02:01:45.731 --> 02:01:46.932

PROVIDED TO ME OBVIOUSLY TO

02:01:51.337 --> 02:01:54.640
OTHERS. OF WHICH- WOULD WOULD

02:01:54.707 --> 02:01:56.609
WOULD AT LEAST IN A TOP LINE

02:01:56.676 --> 02:01:58.277
SORT OF FASHION START TO

02:01:58.344 --> 02:02:00.379
SEPARATE THAT OUT IT JUST SEEMS

02:02:00.446 --> 02:02:03.149
TO ME THAT PROBABLY BECAUSE- OF

02:02:03.215 --> 02:02:07.019
A WHOLE BUNCH OF REASONS-

02:02:07.086 --> 02:02:08.988

CONTINUES BUT I ALSO WANT TO

02:02:20.266 --> 02:02:21.967
KNOW. WHERE THE LINE IS DRAWN

02:02:22.034 --> 02:02:23.269
AT SOME POINT IF THE

02:02:23.335 --> 02:02:25.404

THAT WE WERE SUGGESTING. THERE

02:16:58.843 --> 02:16:59.411
ARE SOME REASONS FOR NOT

02:16:59.477 --> 02:17:03.381
ENOUGH- NOT ENOUGH OF ABILITY

02:39:12.209 --> 02:39:14.278
THAT WHEN I LOOK AT THE FUNDING.

02:39:14.344 --> 02:39:16.380
I KNOW FIRE SAFE COUNCILS HAVE

02:39:16.446 --> 02:39:17.147

ELEMENT THAT IS. IMMUNITY ARMY

02:39:23.587 --> 02:39:25.689
A DIFFERENT APPROACH TO SAY

02:39:25.756 --> 02:39:28.759
WILDFIRE PREVENTION AND SIMPLY-

02:39:28.825 --> 02:39:30.527
LARGE SCALE FORESTRY MANAGEMENT

02:39:30.594 --> 02:39:34.131
IN 10% THE KIND OF WORK THAT

02:39:34.197 --> 02:39:36.266
HAPPENS AROUND COMMUNITIES LIKE

02:39:36.333 --> 02:39:37.701

02:39:50.714 --> 02:39:54.251
RECEIVED IT- SHORT SHRIFT. AND

02:39:54.318 --> 02:39:55.585
THIS BUDGET PROPOSAL DOESN'T

02:39:55.652 --> 02:39:59.122
SEEM TO BE ANY DIFFERENT. 4% I

02:39:59.189 --> 02:40:02.326
THINK OF THE TOTAL BILLION IS.

02:40:02.392 --> 02:40:03.460
WHEN YOU TOWARDS COMMUNITY

02:40:03.527 --> 02:40:06.430
HARDENING LOOKS LIKE ABOUT 96%

02:40:06.496 --> 02:40:08.699
TOWARDS A BROADER RANGE OF

02:40:08.765 --> 02:40:12.169
FORCE. AND FORESTRY HEALTH

02:40:12.235 --> 02:40:15.238

FUNDING IS NOT BEING GOING TO

02:40:30.854 --> 02:40:33.390
LARGE POPULATIONS THAT. AND SO

02:40:33.457 --> 02:40:34.558
I WANTED TO GET A LITTLE SENSE

02:40:34.624 --> 02:40:36.126

02:40:42.632 --> 02:40:45.435
COMMUNITY HARDENING AND WHY.

02:40:45.502 --> 02:40:47.270
WHY NOT TRY TO RESTORE SOME OF

02:40:47.337 --> 02:40:49.206
THE HISTORIC IMBALANCE THAT WE

02:40:49.272 --> 02:40:53.844

02:45:55.512 --> 02:45:56.046
SAYING FROM THE GREEKS THAT

02:45:56.112 --> 02:45:57.714
REALLY SPEAKS TO ME A

02:45:57.781 --> 02:45:59.215
CIVILIZATION'S GREAT WHEN ITS

02:45:59.282 --> 02:46:00.684
ELDERS PLANT TREES WHOSE SHADE

I AIN'T LOOKING CLOSELY THIS

02:46:03.586 --> 02:46:05.422
BUDGET IT SEEMS TO REFLECT THAT

02:46:05.488 --> 02:46:06.656
GENERAL LONG TERM IS TO

02:46:06.723 --> 02:46:08.458
APPROACH- THAT THAT I THINK IS

02:46:08.525 --> 02:46:10.427
SO IMPORTANT- WHILE ALSO

02:46:10.493 --> 02:46:12.662
CONVEYING A STRONG EMPATHY IS

02:46:12.729 --> 02:46:13.229
SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE

02:46:13.296 --> 02:46:15.632
NOTED- I WANTED TO TURN BACK

02:46:15.699 --> 02:46:17.934
TO. THE TOPIC OF EDUCATION AND

02:46:18.001 --> 02:46:20.270
SCHOOLS- NINETY TWO QUESTIONS

02:46:20.337 --> 02:46:21.438
ONE RELATED TO THE K. TO TWELVE

02:46:21.504 --> 02:46:23.807
PIECE AND ANOTHER RELATED TO

02:46:23.873 --> 02:46:27.110

COMMENTS- I'M A DAD TO PUBLIC

SCHOOL KIDS I'VE GOT A THIRD

02:46:32.549 --> 02:46:33.783
ONE THAT'LL DURING KINDERGARTEN

02:46:33.850 --> 02:46:35.952
NEXT FALL. HI THIS IS OBVIOUSLY

02:46:36.019 --> 02:46:38.221
PERSONAL TO ME. BUT I AM

02:46:38.288 --> 02:46:40.256
CONCERNED ABOUT MAYBE THE

02:46:40.323 --> 02:46:42.592
INFLEXIBILITY OF THE GOVERNOR'S

02:46:42.659 --> 02:46:44.127
APPROACH AND I JUST WANTED TO

02:46:44.194 --> 02:46:47.063
DIG IN A LITTLE BIT. THERE I'VE

02:46:47.130 --> 02:46:48.898
GOT SCHOOLS IN MY DISTRICT THAT

02:46:48.965 --> 02:46:49.866
TELL ME THEY'RE READY TO GO

02:46:49.933 --> 02:46:52.068
RIGHT NOW TO RE OPEN AND DO IN

02:46:52.135 --> 02:46:52.936
PERSON LEARNING THEY DON'T NEED

02:46:53.002 --> 02:46:54.471
MUCH AND AS WELL AS FAR AS

02:46:54.537 --> 02:46:56.306
RESOURCES. I'VE GOT SCHOOLS

02:46:56.373 --> 02:46:58.041
THAT TELL ME THAT THAT FOUR

02:46:58.108 --> 02:46:58.808
HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS SEVEN

02:46:58.875 --> 02:46:59.409
HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLAR AMOUNT I

02:46:59.476 --> 02:47:01.077
NOT GONNA BE NEARLY ENOUGH FOR

02:47:01.144 --> 02:47:03.179
THEM. I EASIEST TOO MUCH OF A

02:47:03.246 --> 02:47:05.281
ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH IN I

02:47:05.348 --> 02:47:06.349
GUESS I'D BE INTEREST IN

02:47:06.416 --> 02:47:07.851
PRACTICE IS SOMETHING THAT THAT

02:47:07.917 --> 02:47:09.452
CAN BE COMMUNICATED TO US.

02:47:09.519 --> 02:47:10.920
THROUGH THE BUDGET SUB ONE CAN

02:47:10.987 --> 02:47:13.957
MEET SUBCOMMITTEE- BUT- YOU

02:47:14.023 --> 02:47:15.091
KNOW WHAT WAS THE BASIS FOR

02:47:15.158 --> 02:47:16.593
THAT FIGURE IN THAT PARTICULAR

02:47:16.659 --> 02:47:18.328
AMOUNT OF TWO BILLION DOLLARS.

02:47:18.395 --> 02:47:19.362
AND THEN I GUESS THE OTHER

02:47:19.429 --> 02:47:21.531
RELATED QUESTION IS DOES THIS

02:47:21.598 --> 02:47:23.800
PARTICULAR PROGRAM. MAYBE

02:47:23.867 --> 02:47:25.869
PROVIDE THE WRONG INCENTIVES TO

02:47:25.935 --> 02:47:27.303
TRY TO RE OPENED EARLY RATHER

02:47:27.370 --> 02:47:29.606
THAN SAFELY- YOU KNOW YOU GET

02:47:29.672 --> 02:47:31.307
THIS POT OF MONEY FOR OPENING

02:47:31.374 --> 02:47:33.076
ON ON DEMAND AND- YES I THINK

02:47:33.143 --> 02:47:34.310
CENTER LAYERED COMMENTED QUITE

02:47:34.377 --> 02:47:35.879
ELOQUENTLY ON. SO THE PROBLEM

02:47:35.945 --> 02:47:36.613
WITH THE DEADLINES BUT BUT DOES

02:47:36.679 --> 02:47:37.781
THIS KIND OF THING I THINK AS

02:47:37.847 --> 02:47:39.916
FAR AS- INCENTIVES AND WE'RE-

02:47:39.983 --> 02:47:41.518
CREATING AN- INCENTIVE HERE FOR

02:47:41.584 --> 02:47:43.620
SCHOOLS TO OPEN. QUICKLY BUT

02:47:43.686 --> 02:47:45.688
MAYBE NOT NECESSARILY SAFELY

02:47:45.755 --> 02:47:47.490
AND IS THERE SOME FLEXIBILITY

02:47:47.557 --> 02:47:48.958
OUR WAY TO. TAILOR THIS A

02:47:49.025 --> 02:47:51.227
LITTLE BIT MORE BASED ON- THE

02:47:51.294 --> 02:47:53.329
DISTRICTS AND SO- I GUESS

02:47:53.396 --> 02:47:54.798
THAT'S MY FIRST QUESTION AND

02:47:54.864 --> 02:47:59.636
THEN- PERHAPS ALL. ALL AS MY

02:47:59.702 --> 02:48:01.004
SECOND QUESTION A MOMENT. THANK

02:48:01.070 --> 02:48:01.771
YOU THAT QUESTION AND I THINK

02:48:01.838 --> 02:48:03.606
THAT I WOULD UNDERSCORE THAT ON

02:48:03.673 --> 02:48:04.874
THE GOVERNOR MENTIONED AND IT

02:48:04.941 --> 02:48:06.009
IS FRESH HOW COMPANIES LAST

02:48:06.075 --> 02:48:07.577
WEEK AND- IF WE CAN'T BRING

02:48:07.644 --> 02:48:09.012
STUDENTS AND TEACHERS BACK.

02:48:09.078 --> 02:48:10.346
SAFELY TO SCHOOL THEN WE

02:48:10.413 --> 02:48:11.381
SHOULDN'T BRING THEM BACK

02:48:11.448 --> 02:48:12.582
SAFELY WE CAN BRING THEM BACK

02:48:12.649 --> 02:48:13.917
TO SCHOOL AND SO THAT THE

02:48:13.983 --> 02:48:16.886
DOLLARS THAT ARE PROVIDED A

02:48:16.953 --> 02:48:19.322
REALLY TO- GIVE IT. TO SUPPORT

02:48:19.389 --> 02:48:21.224
THE SCHOOLS IN WHATEVER IT IS

02:48:21.291 --> 02:48:22.759
THAT THEY THINK THEY NEED TO DO

02:48:22.826 --> 02:48:26.129
SO WHETHER IT'S P. P. AGAINST.

02:48:26.196 --> 02:48:29.032
BUT OTHER RESOURCES- IT'S

02:48:29.098 --> 02:48:31.434
TESTING OR CONTACT TRACING- WE

02:48:31.501 --> 02:48:32.735
WANTED TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE

02:48:32.802 --> 02:48:33.970
THAT TO THE SCHOOL SO

02:48:34.037 --> 02:48:35.638
ABSOLUTELY AGREE THAT STUDENTS

02:48:35.705 --> 02:48:37.373
AND TEACHERS. AND OTHER

02:48:37.440 --> 02:48:38.842
VIOLATIONS NOT BE GOING INTO AN

02:48:38.908 --> 02:48:40.176
UNSAFE ENVIRONMENT AND SO I

02:48:40.243 --> 02:48:41.077
JUST WANT TO. MAKE SURE THAT

02:48:41.144 --> 02:48:44.547
THAT. THAT UNDERSCORED- AND I

02:48:44.614 --> 02:48:47.917
THINK THAT THE PLANT WAS-

02:48:47.984 --> 02:48:50.320
INFORMED BY COMMUNICATION BACK

02:48:50.386 --> 02:48:52.222
AND FORTH AND CONTINUES TO BE

02:48:52.288 --> 02:48:53.223
INFORMED WITH THAT

02:48:53.289 --> 02:48:54.891
COMMUNICATION. WITH THE HOPE

02:48:54.958 --> 02:48:57.694
AND UNDERSTANDING THAT- LOCAL-

02:48:57.760 --> 02:48:59.629
LIAISE WILL DISTRICTS WILL DO

02:48:59.696 --> 02:49:00.497
WHAT THEY NEED FOR THEIR

02:49:00.563 --> 02:49:03.166
STUDENTS- AND THAT THAT THAT

02:49:03.233 --> 02:49:04.634
FLEXIBILITY REALLY DOES NEED TO

02:49:04.701 --> 02:49:06.369
BE THERE IT ISN'T A ONE SIZE

02:49:06.436 --> 02:49:08.104
FITS ALL. AND IT SHOULDN'T BE

02:49:08.171 --> 02:49:09.906
BECAUSE WE HAVE MILLIONS OF.

02:49:09.973 --> 02:49:12.876
KIDS ACROSS THOUSANDS- SCHOOLS-

02:49:12.942 --> 02:49:14.611
THAT NEED TO BE. THERE NEEDS

02:49:14.677 --> 02:49:15.845
NEED TO BE ADDRESSED SO JUST

02:49:15.912 --> 02:49:17.881
WANT TO. SAY THAT- YOU KNOW THE

02:49:17.947 --> 02:49:18.815

KNOW YOU KNOW THAT THEY HAVE A

02:51:33.716 --> 02:51:35.518
3% INCREASE BUT THAT I BELIEVE

02:51:35.585 --> 02:51:37.587
WAS ON TOP OF A TEN PERCENT.

02:51:37.654 --> 02:51:38.921
CUT FROM THE PREVIOUS BUDGET

02:51:38.988 --> 02:51:41.090
CYCLE- INSTILLING BACK I THINK

02:51:41.157 --> 02:51:43.693
THE BIG HAVE EIGHT SIGNIFICANT.

02:51:43.760 --> 02:51:46.095

BUDGET. I AND I KNOW FROM

02:51:49.499 --> 02:51:50.967
PERSONAL OBSERVATION THAT THAT

02:51:51.034 --> 02:51:52.368
OUR HIGHER EDUCATION

02:51:52.435 --> 02:51:53.369
INSTITUTIONS ARE PUBLIC AND

02:51:53.436 --> 02:51:54.470
UNIVERSITIES ARE FACING

02:51:54.537 --> 02:51:56.239

TO ADAPT TO NEW CHALLENGES- AND

SO WHILE I'M PLEASED TO SEE THE

02:52:03.880 --> 02:52:05.548
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET DOES NOT PLAN

02:52:05.615 --> 02:52:08.051
ANY TUITION INCREASES. I GUESS

02:52:08.117 --> 02:52:09.552
I'M CONCERNED THAT WE MAY NOT

02:52:09.619 --> 02:52:11.821
BE DOING ENOUGH OR OUR OUR

02:52:11.888 --> 02:52:13.656

BACK. AS AS I WOULD JUST THAT-

02:52:33.476 --> 02:52:34.711
THE PLAN WAS NOT NECESSARILY

02:52:34.777 --> 02:52:37.580
TO- RESTORE CUTS BUT TO REALLY

02:52:37.647 --> 02:52:39.582
HELP OR WE COULD AN OBVIOUSLY

02:52:39.649 --> 02:52:41.918
THREE PERCENT- BASED INCREASE.

02:52:41.984 --> 02:52:44.287
ALONG WITH- SEVERAL MORE I'M

02:52:44.353 --> 02:52:46.189

02:52:51.894 --> 02:52:53.629
ADDITIONAL GENERAL- ADDITIONAL

02:52:53.696 --> 02:52:54.931
FEDERAL FUNDING THAT'S COMING

02:52:57.834 --> 02:53:01.637
POINT NINE BILLION FOR THE UC

02:53:01.704 --> 02:53:03.372
CSU AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES

AGAIN THROUGH THIS BREEDING OF

02:53:14.350 --> 02:53:15.585
DIFFERENT TYPES OF FUNDING

02:53:15.651 --> 02:53:17.420

AND THAT THEY HAVE BEEN-

02:53:22.492 --> 02:53:23.593
DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED

02:53:23.659 --> 02:53:24.427

CALIFORNIANS- AND THEN IT TOO

02:55:02.491 --> 02:55:05.161
MIGHT. YOU KNOW WE STRUGGLE

02:55:05.228 --> 02:55:06.762
BETWEEN DOING THINGS TO THE

TRYING TO DO POLICY THAT

02:55:10.633 --> 02:55:13.002
REQUIRES FUNDING- SO I

02:55:13.069 --> 02:55:14.470
APPRECIATE HOW MUCH YOU PUT IN

02:55:14.537 --> 02:55:15.605
FOR MENTAL HEALTH BUT I THINK

02:55:15.671 --> 02:55:16.772
IF THERE'S ANY OTHER ISSUE

02:55:16.839 --> 02:55:19.976
THAT- IS ON THE FOREFRONT OF

02:55:20.042 --> 02:55:22.211
CALIFORNIA'S MIND BESIDES EDM

02:55:22.278 --> 02:55:23.946
AND THE ECONOMY CO IT IS THAT

02:55:24.013 --> 02:55:25.448
THE ISSUES AROUND MENTAL HEALTH

02:55:25.514 --> 02:55:27.283
AND HOMELESSNESS AND HOW THOSE.

02:55:27.350 --> 02:55:29.518
HOW THOSE INTERSECT SO- I KNOW

02:55:29.585 --> 02:55:30.953
MYSELF AND A LOT OF MY PEERS

02:55:31.020 --> 02:55:32.355
REALLY WANNA WORK ON THAT THIS

02:55:32.421 --> 02:55:33.322
YEAR AND LOOK FORWARD TO

02:55:33.389 --> 02:55:35.258
WORKING WITH THAT THE

02:55:35.324 --> 02:55:37.293
ADMINISTRATION SO. IF YOU NEED

02:55:37.360 --> 02:55:38.227
IDEAS PLEASE DON'T HESITATE TO

02:55:38.294 --> 02:55:40.630
REACH OUT- AND I THINK WE SEE

02:55:40.696 --> 02:55:42.098
IT WITH THE CHRONIC AND

02:55:42.164 --> 02:55:44.400
PERSISTENT POPULATION BUT THEN

02:55:44.467 --> 02:55:45.635
I WOULD OFFER THERE IS NOT ONE

02:55:45.701 --> 02:55:47.837
OF US. ATTENDING THIS. BUDGET

02:55:47.904 --> 02:55:49.105
HEARING RIGHT NOW WHO HAS NOT

02:55:49.171 --> 02:55:51.274
FELT AN INCREASE IN ANXIETY AND

02:55:51.340 --> 02:55:54.543
I'M EASE- UNKNOWN. AND SO YOU

02:55:54.610 --> 02:55:55.711
KNOW YOU PUT THAT ON TOP OF

02:55:55.778 --> 02:55:57.847
THAT BEING HOMELESS OR- LIVING

02:55:57.914 --> 02:56:00.216
IN AN ABUSIVE SITUATION AND WE

02:56:00.283 --> 02:56:00.783
JUST KNOW THAT JUST FOR THE

02:56:00.850 --> 02:56:02.318
GENERAL POPULATION. ISSUES

02:56:02.385 --> 02:56:03.486
AROUND MENTAL HEALTH WILL

02:56:03.552 --> 02:56:05.221
CONTINUE TO GROW SO AS MUCH AS

02:56:05.288 --> 02:56:07.924
WE CAN DO INTO THE SCHOOLS-

02:56:07.990 --> 02:56:10.893
IT'S GONNA BE REALLY IMPORTANT-

02:56:10.960 --> 02:56:12.628
AND THEN I GUESS JUST. JUST TO

02:56:12.695 --> 02:56:14.063
BE ABLE TO ASK THE KIND OF THE

02:56:14.130 --> 02:56:15.498
MIRACLE QUESTION IF WE DEAL.

02:56:15.564 --> 02:56:18.301
WITH STARKEY- SO. SOME OF THE

02:56:18.367 --> 02:56:20.069
EARLIER PREDICTIONS WERE I

02:56:20.136 --> 02:56:22.838
THINK TWENTY SIX BILLION FOR-

02:56:22.905 --> 02:56:24.707
THE WINDFALL AND NOW IT'S

02:56:24.774 --> 02:56:26.842
STANDARD FIFTEEN. HOW CONFIDENT

02:56:26.909 --> 02:56:28.077
ARE WE THAT IT'S NOT GOING TO

02:56:28.144 --> 02:56:30.179
GET EVEN FURTHER BY THE TIME

02:56:30.246 --> 02:56:32.381
THE MAY REVISE COMES AND THEN

02:56:32.448 --> 02:56:34.383
HOW WE MAKE THAT ADJUSTMENT.

02:56:34.450 --> 02:56:35.851
BUT I GUESS MY ON THE OTHER

02:56:35.918 --> 02:56:38.187
SIDE OF THAT QUESTION IS THE

02:56:38.254 --> 02:56:41.190
IDEA OF- IF WE GET A HUGE

02:56:41.257 --> 02:56:45.094
INFUSION OF FEDERAL FUNDS-

02:56:45.161 --> 02:56:46.495
WHERE THEN WOULD WE TAKE THE

02:56:46.562 --> 02:56:48.531
GENERAL FUND MONEY AND INFUSE

02:56:48.597 --> 02:56:50.433
IT BACK IN TO THE BUDGET WRITES

02:56:50.499 --> 02:56:51.834
A LETTER THAT SAYS KIND

02:56:51.901 --> 02:56:52.668
AMERICAN QUESTION MY IF YOU

02:56:52.735 --> 02:56:55.671
pMIGHT BE GETTING SOME MORE.

02:56:55.738 --> 02:56:59.041
WHERE MOST FOCUSED DO YOU THINK

02:56:59.108 --> 02:57:02.545
YOU WOULD YOU WOULD INVEST. I

02:57:02.611 --> 02:57:04.347
WOULD LIE IF I WON THE LOTTERY

02:57:04.413 --> 02:57:08.384
KIND OF QUESTION- IT WAS

02:57:08.451 --> 02:57:09.652
BILLIONS AND BILLIONS WERE NOT

02:57:09.719 --> 02:57:11.954
COUNTING ON RIGHT NOW WHAT WILL

02:57:12.021 --> 02:57:14.290
WE DO WITH OUR MONEY- I LOVE

02:57:14.357 --> 02:57:15.791
THE QUESTION I WOULD SAY THAT

02:57:15.858 --> 02:57:17.293
GENERALLY IF. WHEN THE FEDERAL

02:57:17.360 --> 02:57:18.461
GOVERNMENT DOES GIVE US MONEY

02:57:18.527 --> 02:57:20.396
WE DO LOOK FOR PLACES IF IT'S

02:57:20.463 --> 02:57:22.832
IF IT'S- POSSIBLE. TO BACK FILL

02:57:22.898 --> 02:57:23.899
FOR THE GENERAL FUND SO THAT WE

02:57:23.966 --> 02:57:25.735
CAN USE THOSE PRECIOUS DOLLARS

02:57:25.801 --> 02:57:29.405
ON ANOTHER- STATE PRIORITIES.

02:57:29.472 --> 02:57:31.774
OBVIOUSLY WE WANT TO MAXIMIZE

02:57:31.841 --> 02:57:33.275
ALL THE FEDERAL FUNDING GET

02:57:33.342 --> 02:57:34.643
WHENEVER. THE BILL AND THAT

02:57:34.710 --> 02:57:36.178
INCLUDES FOR THE EMERGENCY

02:57:36.245 --> 02:57:38.280
RESPONSE AND- OUR ARTICLE IN

02:57:38.347 --> 02:57:41.250
RESPONSE AND TRYING TO. GET

02:57:41.317 --> 02:57:42.885
BACK FEMA REIMBURSEMENTS FOR A

02:57:42.952 --> 02:57:43.853
LOT OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE

02:57:43.919 --> 02:57:45.955
SPENDING- STATE MONEY FOR UP

02:57:46.022 --> 02:57:48.958
FRONT- AND I GUESS YOUR

02:57:49.025 --> 02:57:51.460
QUESTION REALLY IS- IS YOU KNOW

02:57:51.527 --> 02:57:52.361
WHERE WHERE DO ALL OF OUR

02:57:52.428 --> 02:57:53.929
PRIORITIES LIE AND I WOULD SAY

02:57:53.996 --> 02:57:56.098
AGAIN THIS IS- A GIVE AND TAKE.

02:57:56.165 --> 02:57:58.334
AND DEFINITELY MUCH MORE

02:57:58.401 --> 02:57:59.502
CONVERSATION WILL OCCUR IN THE

02:57:59.568 --> 02:58:01.470
SPRING- BUT I DO WANT TO MAKE A

02:58:01.537 --> 02:58:05.041
POINT THAT- OUR OUR ECONOMICS-

02:58:05.107 --> 02:58:08.144
UNIT- HAS COME OUT WITH-

02:58:08.210 --> 02:58:10.046
ADDITIONAL REVENUES AND FROM

02:58:10.112 --> 02:58:12.214
DECEMBER ABOVE THE FORECASTED

02:58:12.281 --> 02:58:13.983
IN OUR CURRENT- THE- GOVERNOR'S

02:58:14.050 --> 02:58:16.052
BUDGET- AN ADDITIONAL TWO POINT

02:58:16.118 --> 02:58:18.054
FOUR BILLION. IN REVENUES FROM

02:58:18.120 --> 02:58:20.022
DECEMBER AGAIN ABOUT WHAT WE

02:58:20.089 --> 02:58:20.890
HAVE FORECASTED BUT I WOULD

02:58:20.956 --> 02:58:22.958
ALSO SAY IT'S VERY TENUOUS TO

02:58:23.025 --> 02:58:24.427
EXPECT THAT THAT WILL HAPPEN

AND- EXPENDITURES AND HAVE A

02:58:33.269 --> 02:58:35.271
MUCH BETTER SENSE- OF WHERE WE

02:58:35.337 --> 02:58:37.039
ARE AND WHAT WE CAN DO IF WE DO

02:58:37.106 --> 02:58:38.941
HAVE THAT- YOU KNOW IT

02:58:39.008 --> 02:58:40.242
ADDITIONAL WINDFALL ABOUT THE-

02:58:40.309 --> 02:58:42.078
THE FIFTEEN HOUR OR WHEN FALL

02:58:42.144 --> 02:58:43.846
SURPLUS EXTRA MONEY WHATEVER

02:58:43.913 --> 02:58:45.181
YOU WANNA CALL IT ABOVE. WHAT

02:58:45.247 --> 02:58:48.918
WE CURRENTLY. HAVE IN THE

02:58:48.984 --> 02:58:49.752
BUDGET AT FIFTEEN BILLION. AND

02:58:49.819 --> 02:58:50.920
THEN JUST A ONE FINAL. AND YOU

02:58:50.986 --> 02:58:52.588
ALL FOR ALL YOU WERE IN. THIS

02:58:52.655 --> 02:58:54.824
OVER SO AND A LOOK FORWARD TO.

02:58:54.890 --> 02:58:56.826
SPEAKING IN THE- SO HEARINGS

02:58:56.892 --> 02:58:58.494
BUT I WAS VERY OF THE

02:58:58.561 --> 02:59:00.062
GOVERNOR'S ALL THE SIXTY FIVE

02:59:00.129 --> 02:59:01.764
YEAR COULD HAVE A VACCINE NOW

02:59:01.831 --> 02:59:03.699
BUT- THAT YOU KNOW IT'S CREATED

02:59:03.766 --> 02:59:05.835
A BUNCH OF LOGISTICAL ISSUES I

02:59:05.901 --> 02:59:07.470
THINK. A LOT OF OUR- COUNTY

02:59:07.536 --> 02:59:09.205
LEVEL PUBLIC HEALTH DIRECTORS

02:59:09.271 --> 02:59:11.273
WHO ARE ALREADY. OVERWHELMED

02:59:11.340 --> 02:59:12.241
WITH THE PANDEMIC AND DEALING

02:59:12.308 --> 02:59:14.510
WITH. NOW WE HAVE A LOT OF

02:59:14.577 --> 02:59:17.079
FOLKS EXPECTING OUT- THE

02:59:17.146 --> 02:59:17.646
VACCINE SO I CERTAINLY HOPE

02:59:17.713 --> 02:59:19.415
THAT WE'RE GONNA. REALLY PUSH

02:59:19.482 --> 02:59:21.117
THOSE VACCINES OUT. TO MAKE

02:59:21.183 --> 02:59:22.518
SURE THAT WE GOT WHAT WE

02:59:22.585 --> 02:59:23.953
KEEPING OUR WORD AND NOT. A

02:59:24.019 --> 02:59:25.287
FURTHER DISAPPOINTING THE

02:59:25.354 --> 02:59:27.823
PUBLIC THANK. SURE AND I WOULD

02:59:27.890 --> 02:59:29.291
JUST HIGHLIGHT IS WITH THIS IS

02:59:29.358 --> 02:59:30.626
NOT DONE BEFORE AND THAT THAT

02:59:30.693 --> 02:59:31.694
IS MY MISTAKE IS THAT WE DO

02:59:31.760 --> 02:59:34.597
HAVE DOLLARS IN THE BUDGET THAT

02:59:34.663 --> 02:59:37.533
WE HAVE- BASICALLY ESTIMATED

02:59:37.600 --> 02:59:39.635
TOWARDS VACCINE DISTRIBUTION.

02:59:39.702 --> 02:59:41.070
AND OBVIOUSLY THERE NEEDS TO BE

02:59:41.137 --> 02:59:41.971
A LOT OF COORDINATION AND

02:59:42.037 --> 02:59:43.873
COMMUNICATION BETWEEN. THE

02:59:43.939 --> 02:59:45.774
STATE AND LOCALS AND IN REGARDS

02:59:45.841 --> 02:59:46.742

SYSTEM- AND WITH COUNTIES AND

02:59:59.155 --> 03:00:02.691

03:00:02.758 --> 03:00:04.093
SUCCESSFUL DISTRIBUTION OF

03:00:04.160 --> 03:00:05.861

03:05:34.423 --> 03:05:35.958
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE

03:05:36.024 --> 03:05:39.828
BE VERY. DELIBERATE ABOUT HOW

03:05:39.895 --> 03:05:42.130
WE TAKE IT THE REVENUE THAT WE

03:05:42.197 --> 03:05:45.133
HAVE NOW AND HOW WE INVESTED

03:05:45.200 --> 03:05:49.838
IN- IN OUR RESIDENTS SO THAT WE

03:05:49.905 --> 03:05:50.606
CAN GET THE BEST OUTCOME

03:05:50.672 --> 03:05:53.041
POSSIBLE. WE NEED TO WORK AS

03:05:53.108 --> 03:05:54.810
DILIGENTLY AS POSSIBLE TO PULL

03:05:54.877 --> 03:05:57.012
DOWN FEDERAL FUNDS THAT WE CAN

03:05:57.079 --> 03:05:58.914
AND THEN COME UP. TO GET

03:05:58.981 --> 03:06:00.883
TOGETHER- AND TO HELP TO

03:06:00.949 --> 03:06:02.150
STARTED DRESS SOME OF THESE

03:06:02.217 --> 03:06:04.553
ISSUES AND WE NEED TO- ENGAGE

03:06:04.620 --> 03:06:05.854
THE LEGISLATURE I JUST WANT TO

03:06:05.921 --> 03:06:07.189
SAY THAT BECAUSE ALL OF OUR

03:06:07.256 --> 03:06:08.123
DISTRICTS ARE A LITTLE BIT

03:06:08.190 --> 03:06:09.324
DIFFERENTLY AND WE'RE FACING

03:06:09.391 --> 03:06:11.026
THIS PANDEMIC A LITTLE BIT

03:06:11.093 --> 03:06:13.695
DIFFERENTLY AS WELL- N. AS A AS

03:06:13.762 --> 03:06:16.465
A FOOTNOTE- THIS IS REALLY BEEN

03:06:16.532 --> 03:06:19.501
A- A TOUGH YEAR. AND THE TOUGH

03:06:19.568 --> 03:06:20.836
YEAR HAS FALLING

03:06:20.903 --> 03:06:22.170
DISPROPORTIONATELY ON THE

03:06:22.237 --> 03:06:23.705
POOREST MEMBERS OF OUR

03:06:23.772 --> 03:06:26.008
COMMUNITY AND THE ONE SHINING

03:06:26.074 --> 03:06:29.077
LIGHT IS THE VACCINE. AND SO- I

03:06:29.144 --> 03:06:30.846
JUST WANT TO SAY THAT WE NEED

03:06:30.913 --> 03:06:33.415
TO DO A BETTER JOB BECAUSE AS I

03:06:33.482 --> 03:06:36.218
HAVE CALLED AROUND TO FIND OUT

03:06:36.285 --> 03:06:37.219
THE ACCESSIBILITY OF THE

03:06:37.286 --> 03:06:40.789
VACCINE- THERE IS CONFUSION.

03:06:40.856 --> 03:06:42.424
AND THERE'S DISAGREEMENT OVER

03:06:42.491 --> 03:06:44.793
HOW THE TIERED SYSTEM WORKS AND

03:06:44.860 --> 03:06:47.062
WOOD AND THAT IS THE ONE

03:06:47.129 --> 03:06:48.530
OPPORTUNITY WE HAVE TO SHOW

03:06:48.597 --> 03:06:49.698
THAT GOVERNMENT CAN FUNCTION

03:06:49.765 --> 03:06:50.899
WELL IN THAT WERE WORKING

03:06:50.966 --> 03:06:52.134
TOGETHER AND THAT WE'RE GOING

03:06:52.200 --> 03:06:53.602
TO GET THIS ONE RIGHT SO I WANT

03:06:53.669 --> 03:06:54.736
TO JUST SAY THAT BECAUSE I

03:06:54.803 --> 03:06:55.771
THINK THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY

03:06:55.837 --> 03:06:57.973
HERE. BUT WE HAVE TO BE VERY

03:06:58.040 --> 03:07:00.242
CLEAR ABOUT. WHO SHOULD BE

03:07:00.309 --> 03:07:01.443
RECEIVING THE VACCINE RIGHT NOW

03:07:01.510 --> 03:07:03.312
WE NEED TO MOVE WITH ALL DUE

03:07:03.378 --> 03:07:04.613
DELIBERATE SPEED TO MAKE SURE

03:07:04.680 --> 03:07:07.316
THAT THEY GET INTO PEOPLE'S

03:07:07.382 --> 03:07:07.916
ARMS SO I JUST SAY I'VE GOT I

03:07:07.983 --> 03:07:09.718
SOME QUESTION ABOUT. BUT BUDGET

03:07:09.785 --> 03:07:12.688

WAS HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS-

03:08:27.095 --> 03:08:28.096
THERE COULD BE SOME DUPLICATION

03:08:28.163 --> 03:08:29.264
IN THERE BUT I DON'T EXPECT

03:08:29.331 --> 03:08:30.766
THAT IT EXPECTED TO BE

03:08:30.832 --> 03:08:31.566
SOMEWHERE IN THAT ORDER OF

03:08:31.633 --> 03:08:33.602

AS IT RELATES TO THE SCORING

03:08:44.079 --> 03:08:46.815
CRITERIA. IT'S GOING TO BE ON

03:08:46.882 --> 03:08:48.583
THREE PRINCIPAL AREAS-

03:08:48.650 --> 03:08:50.018
GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION BASED

03:08:50.085 --> 03:08:51.787
ON THE CODE NINETEEN HEALTH AND

03:08:51.853 --> 03:08:54.122
SAFETY RESTRICTIONS- ACROSS THE

03:08:54.189 --> 03:08:56.058
STATE. THAT BENEFITS THE

03:08:56.124 --> 03:08:57.659
INDUSTRIES MOST IMPACTED BY THE

03:08:57.726 --> 03:08:59.494
PANDEMIC. AND THEN IT'S LOOKING

03:08:59.561 --> 03:09:01.196
OUT UNDER CENTER SEARCH SMALL

03:09:01.263 --> 03:09:03.632
BUSINESS GROUPS- ACROSS THE

03:09:03.699 --> 03:09:05.367
STATE SO THAT MIGHT BE.

03:09:05.434 --> 03:09:07.369
MAJORITY OWNED OR AROUND THE

03:09:07.436 --> 03:09:09.371
DAILY BASIS BY WOMEN MINORITIES

BUSINESSES LOCATED IN THE LOW.

03:09:15.510 --> 03:09:16.011
TO MODERATE INCOME IN RURAL

03:09:16.078 --> 03:09:17.579
AREAS. VERY GOOD THANK YOU I

03:09:17.646 --> 03:09:18.780
EXPECT TO HAVE A LITTLE BIT

03:09:18.847 --> 03:09:20.215
MORE DATA IN TERMS OF THE

03:09:20.282 --> 03:09:22.117
NUMBERS AYE AYE. THE PURPOSE OF

03:09:22.184 --> 03:09:24.252
THAT OBVIOUSLY IS TO FIX IT IS

03:09:24.319 --> 03:09:25.153
TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE RIGHT

03:09:25.220 --> 03:09:27.389
SIZE- WHETHER WE NEED TO ADD

03:09:27.456 --> 03:09:29.124
MORE MONEY TO PRODUCE. TO THIS

03:09:29.191 --> 03:09:30.826
PARTICULAR PROGRAM OR NOT.

03:09:30.892 --> 03:09:32.461
MOVING ON TO THE CAPTAIN PIZZA

03:09:32.527 --> 03:09:35.797
GRANT PROGRAM THIS THIS IS-

03:09:35.864 --> 03:09:36.765
ANTICIPATED BE A PROGRAM THAT

03:09:36.832 --> 03:09:39.067
WOULD HELP BUSINESSES THAT WANT

03:09:39.134 --> 03:09:42.938
TO EXPAND. AND CAN YOU DEFINE

03:09:43.004 --> 03:09:44.740
OR ELABORATE WHAT QUALIFIES AS

03:09:44.806 --> 03:09:46.374
A HIGH NEED HIGH OPPORTUNITY

03:09:46.441 --> 03:09:50.412
AREA- AND THEN MY SECOND

03:09:50.479 --> 03:09:56.651
CONCERN IS- IF IN FACT.

03:09:56.718 --> 03:09:59.054
COMPANIES COULD. OBTAIN A

03:09:59.121 --> 03:10:02.390
GRANT. AND HOW THAT HAVE NO OR

03:10:02.457 --> 03:10:04.292
LITTLE TAX LIABILITY IN THE

03:10:04.359 --> 03:10:05.494
STATE WHAT WOULD PREVENT THEM

03:10:05.560 --> 03:10:08.663
FROM. RECEIVING A GRANT AND

03:10:08.730 --> 03:10:09.297
THEN TURNING AROUND AND LEAVING

03:10:09.364 --> 03:10:16.271
THE STATE IN THE YEAR TWO. HI

03:10:16.338 --> 03:10:19.608
THIS IS GOING TO COME AGAIN- AS

03:10:19.674 --> 03:10:21.309
IT RELATES TO THE DEFINITION

03:10:21.376 --> 03:10:22.978
AND WE'RE STILL SORT OF WORKING

03:10:23.044 --> 03:10:25.480
THROUGH HOW I'M HOW PRECISELY

03:10:25.547 --> 03:10:26.948
DEFINED THAT WERE ACTUALLY SORT

03:10:27.015 --> 03:10:28.049
OF HOPING TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT

03:10:28.116 --> 03:10:30.752
FOR YOU- THE GUIDELINE PROCESS

03:10:30.819 --> 03:10:33.121
IN KALKAJI. THE IDEA HERE IS

03:10:33.188 --> 03:10:35.557
THAT- LOOKING AT REGIONS OF THE

03:10:35.624 --> 03:10:38.160
STATE THAT- YOU COULD USE

03:10:38.226 --> 03:10:39.661
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT HAVE BEEN

03:10:39.728 --> 03:10:42.597
LEFT BEHIND SORT OF EVEN PRIOR

03:10:42.664 --> 03:10:44.800
TO COVER NINETEEN AND- RECOVERY

03:10:44.866 --> 03:10:48.203
FROM THE- GREAT RECESSION AND

03:10:48.270 --> 03:10:50.372
THOSE AREAS WHERE WHERE WHERE

03:10:50.438 --> 03:10:52.707
THE- RECOVERY DIDN'T YOU KNOW

03:10:52.774 --> 03:10:54.576
MEET OUR ORDER WAS NOT

03:10:54.643 --> 03:10:55.777
CONSISTENT WITH THE REST OF THE

03:10:55.844 --> 03:10:57.245
STATE SO AND THEN THERE'S

03:10:57.312 --> 03:10:58.914
NUANCE AND THEIR ANSWER SO

03:10:58.980 --> 03:11:00.582
WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE THIS IS AS

03:11:00.649 --> 03:11:02.450
FLEXIBLE AS POSSIBLE THAT. YOU

03:11:02.517 --> 03:11:03.852
KNOW THAT EVEN IF IT'S IN AN

03:11:03.919 --> 03:11:05.921
INDUSTRIAL AREA NEAR LOW INCOME

03:11:05.987 --> 03:11:07.789
AREA THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY PUT

03:11:07.856 --> 03:11:09.257
SOMETHING IN BECAUSE FOLKS IN

03:11:09.324 --> 03:11:11.226
THOSE AREAS CAN'T GO TO WORK-

03:11:11.293 --> 03:11:12.627
JUST ACROSS THE STREET SO

03:11:12.694 --> 03:11:14.162
THERE'S CHALLENGES WITH GETTING

03:11:14.229 --> 03:11:16.598
TO SPUR SCRIPTED AMMAN SO WE'RE

03:11:16.665 --> 03:11:18.466
TRYING TO PUT OUT A DEFINITION

03:11:18.533 --> 03:11:19.935
TO SERVE THE INTENDED PURPOSE

03:11:20.001 --> 03:11:22.671
WITHOUT BEING OVERLY LIMITED-

03:11:22.737 --> 03:11:25.106
BY A STATUTE IN THE FUTURE- AND

03:11:25.173 --> 03:11:28.710
THEN- AB. FORGETTING YOUR OTHER

03:11:28.777 --> 03:11:32.547
QUESTION- I'M SORRY IT WAS THAT

03:11:32.614 --> 03:11:38.854
HAD TO DO WITH- THE FACT. THAT

03:11:38.920 --> 03:11:39.788
IF WE IN FACT. GRANT

03:11:39.855 --> 03:11:40.589
ACCOMPANIED DOESN'T PAY. IN THE

03:11:40.655 --> 03:11:41.790
STATE OF A GRAY TO COME THAT

03:11:41.857 --> 03:11:44.159
DOESN'T PAY TAXES IN THE STATE-

03:11:44.226 --> 03:11:45.460
WHAT WOULD KEEP THEM FROM

03:11:45.527 --> 03:11:46.995
LEAVING THE STATE NEAR TO ONCE

03:11:47.062 --> 03:11:49.297
THEY TAKE THE GRANT. USE IT AND

03:11:49.364 --> 03:11:51.466
THEN LEAVE. YEAH SO WE'RE WE'RE

03:11:51.533 --> 03:11:54.502
TRYING TO LOOK AT- RECAPTURE OR

03:11:54.569 --> 03:11:56.104
COLLECTION OPTIONS THAT CURRENT

03:11:56.171 --> 03:11:58.540
CAL COMPETES PROGRAM. DOES HAVE

03:11:58.607 --> 03:12:00.942
A RECAPTURE IF THEY DON'T NEED

03:12:01.009 --> 03:12:03.778
THAT- CRITERIA AS LAID OUT IN

03:12:03.845 --> 03:12:05.046
THE AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE STATE

03:12:05.113 --> 03:12:07.349
MORE BUSINESS. SO WHERE-

03:12:07.415 --> 03:12:09.017
LOOKING AT IT YOU KNOW. THE

03:12:09.084 --> 03:12:10.852
BEST WAYS TO GO ABOUT DOING

03:12:10.919 --> 03:12:13.221
THAT WHEN THE WHEN THE MET-

03:12:13.288 --> 03:12:17.559

03:12:17.626 --> 03:12:18.960
AGREED UPON- PLAN. VERY GOOD SO

03:12:19.027 --> 03:12:20.729

TOGETHER I BELIEVE THAT'S ONE

03:12:27.435 --> 03:12:28.003
OF THE ISSUES THAT WAS RAISED

03:12:28.069 --> 03:12:29.738

CONVERSATIONS ABOUT. ABOUT

03:12:34.709 --> 03:12:37.212
EXACTLY HOW THAT WOULD ROLL OUT

03:12:37.279 --> 03:12:38.980
AND WHAT KIND OF BUSINESSES

03:12:39.047 --> 03:12:40.081
COULD BENEFIT AND WHAT KIND OF

03:12:40.148 --> 03:12:42.617

COMMUNITY IN THE COMMUNITY THAT

03:13:36.237 --> 03:13:38.406

THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES

03:21:53.401 --> 03:21:54.535
BUDGET ESPECIALLY WE LOOK AT

03:21:54.602 --> 03:21:56.938
THE OUT YEAR PROJECTIONS- WHAT

03:21:57.004 --> 03:21:58.840
WE'VE DONE FOR MANY YEARS AS

03:21:58.906 --> 03:22:02.477

DO IS WE SUSPEND THOSE CUTS.

03:22:09.917 --> 03:22:12.787

LOOKING OUT YOUR PROJECTIONS.

03:22:29.337 --> 03:22:31.272
I'M NOT SURE IT'S NECESSARILY

03:22:31.339 --> 03:22:33.207
APPROPRIATE OR FAIR TO SAY THAT

03:22:33.274 --> 03:22:34.742
WELL ACTUALLY WHAT WE CAN DO IS

03:22:34.809 --> 03:22:37.778
NOT BUDGET ON THE IDEA THAT-

03:22:37.845 --> 03:22:38.980
YOU KNOW NEXT YEAR THE YEAR

03:22:39.046 --> 03:22:40.815

KNOW ON ALL THESE PROGRAMS ARE

03:22:44.085 --> 03:22:45.720
HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AND-

03:22:45.786 --> 03:22:47.121
AS THOSE PROGRAMS ARE.

03:22:47.188 --> 03:22:49.323
DESPERATELY NEEDED AND- SO WE

03:22:49.390 --> 03:22:50.658
SUSPEND THESE CUTS YEAR AFTER

03:22:50.725 --> 03:22:51.859
YEAR THAT'S APPROPRIATE THING

03:22:51.926 --> 03:22:54.195
TO DO BUT I JUST I. JUST

03:22:54.262 --> 03:22:55.596
CAREFUL THE NOMENCLATURE THAT

03:22:55.663 --> 03:22:59.901
WE'RE SUSPENDING. THE CUTS

03:22:59.967 --> 03:23:00.801
BECAUSE WHAT WE'RE REALLY DOING

03:23:00.868 --> 03:23:01.769
IS ONE WE DOES HAPPEN THOSE ARE

03:23:01.836 --> 03:23:02.770
TO BE CUT IN AND THEN SOMEONE'S

03:23:02.837 --> 03:23:03.938
GOT SAY WELL WE'LL NEED TO.

03:23:04.005 --> 03:23:05.573
SOME MORE. AND SO- AND AGAIN

03:23:05.640 --> 03:23:06.607
THIS IS PARTICULAR TO HEALTH

03:23:06.674 --> 03:23:07.742
AND HUMAN SERVICES I JUST WANNA

03:23:07.808 --> 03:23:08.776
MENTION THAT THE OTHER THING I

03:23:08.843 --> 03:23:10.278
ALSO DO WANT TO QUICKLY MENTION

03:23:10.344 --> 03:23:12.380
AS WELL IS- ON THE MEDICAL

03:23:12.446 --> 03:23:14.549
FRONT I REALLY DO APPRECIATE-

03:23:14.615 --> 03:23:16.317
THE- WHAT WE'RE TRYING O DO

03:23:16.384 --> 03:23:18.419
WITH CAL AIM. WHICH IS WHICH

03:23:18.486 --> 03:23:20.755
FUNDAMENTALLY IS TRYING TO

03:23:20.821 --> 03:23:21.989
IMPROVE OUR MEDICARE PROGRAM

03:23:22.056 --> 03:23:22.823
CERTAINLY YOU KNOW THEIR

03:23:22.890 --> 03:23:24.525
SPECIFICS THAT- LOOK FOR TO

03:23:24.592 --> 03:23:26.127
DIGGING INTO ONE EARNED AND THE

03:23:26.193 --> 03:23:27.962
SUBCOMMITTEE AND- PERHAPS SOME

03:23:28.029 --> 03:23:29.063
CHANGES OR TWEAKS THAT WE

03:23:29.130 --> 03:23:30.398
MIGHT. HEAR FROM DIFFERENT

03:23:30.464 --> 03:23:32.833
PEOPLE ABOUT IT. BUT I WOULD

03:23:32.900 --> 03:23:34.569
MAKE NOTE THAT PART OF THE

03:23:34.635 --> 03:23:36.037
ISSUE IN TERMS OF TIMING IS

03:23:36.103 --> 03:23:37.104
THAT NEAR THE WAIVERS FOR

03:23:37.171 --> 03:23:38.773
EXAMPLE WE GOT A WAIVER THAT WE

03:23:38.839 --> 03:23:40.441
GOT EXTENSION OR ELEVEN FIFTEEN

03:23:40.508 --> 03:23:41.742
WAIVER BUT THAT WILL. END THIS

03:23:41.809 --> 03:23:43.511
YEARS AGO WHEN YEAR EXTENSION.

03:23:43.578 --> 03:23:45.279
SO WE DO HAVE TO REPOSITION OUR

03:23:45.346 --> 03:23:46.747
MEDICAL PROGRAM ANYWAY BECAUSE

03:23:46.814 --> 03:23:47.648
OF THE NATURE OF THE WAIVERS

03:23:47.715 --> 03:23:49.317
THAT WERE. LOOKING FOR AND

03:23:49.383 --> 03:23:51.152
GETTING AND SO I CERTAINLY

03:23:51.218 --> 03:23:52.453
RECOGNIZE THAT SOME PEOPLE MA

03:23:52.520 --> 03:23:53.487
RAISE THE QUESTION OF WHY WE

03:23:53.554 --> 03:23:55.156
SPENDING MORE MONEY ON ON GOING

03:23:55.222 --> 03:23:56.857
ON MEDIC CAL BUT- I ACTUALLY

03:23:56.924 --> 03:23:58.225
THINK THAT THESE STEPS ARE

03:23:58.292 --> 03:23:59.660
REPOSITION MEDICAL PROGRAM TO

03:23:59.727 --> 03:24:00.528
HOPEFULLY ACTUALLY BE MORE

03:24:00.595 --> 03:24:01.896
EFFECTIVE AND MORE COST

03:24:01.963 --> 03:24:03.497
EFFICIENT GOING FORWARD. AND WE

03:24:03.564 --> 03:24:04.732
KNOW THAT AFTER CODE WE'RE

03:24:04.799 --> 03:24:05.900
GOING TO HAVE MORE MENTAL

03:24:05.967 --> 03:24:06.667
HEALTH ISSUES AND OTHER TYPES

03:24:06.734 --> 03:24:08.502
OF THINGS AS WELL. AND THERE'S

03:24:08.569 --> 03:24:09.437
AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO A BETTER

03:24:09.503 --> 03:24:11.372
JOB OF. DOING THAT SO I DO JUST

03:24:11.439 --> 03:24:12.773
WANT TO SAY THAT BUT WE LOOK

03:24:12.840 --> 03:24:16.410
FORWARD TO DIGGING INTO. THAT

03:24:16.477 --> 03:24:16.978
MORE IN DEPTH AND THE BUDGET

03:24:17.044 --> 03:24:17.612
SUB COMMITTEE. OBVIOUSLY WE'RE

03:24:17.678 --> 03:24:19.413
DEALING A PANDEMIC. AND

03:24:19.480 --> 03:24:20.615
CERTAINLY I THINK ONE OF OUR

03:24:20.681 --> 03:24:21.949
TOP PRIORITIES IS FIGURE OUT

03:24:22.016 --> 03:24:23.751
HOW DO WE CONTAIN THIS- THIS.

03:24:23.818 --> 03:24:24.785
COVERED VIRUS WHICH IS

03:24:24.852 --> 03:24:26.087
UNFORTUNATELY. TAKEN TO

03:24:26.153 --> 03:24:27.655
MOBILIZE A TO MAKE CALIFORNIANS

03:24:27.722 --> 03:24:29.991
IS DEVASTATED. FAMILIES OUR

03:24:30.057 --> 03:24:31.892
ECONOMY. HIS ABILITY GO TO

03:24:31.959 --> 03:24:33.995
SCHOOL PEOPLE GAME BE ABLE TO

03:24:34.061 --> 03:24:35.896
GO TO WORK BUSINESSES BEING

03:24:35.963 --> 03:24:37.932
OPEN- AND I'VE I RECOGNIZE

03:24:37.999 --> 03:24:39.667
THAT- YOU KNOW WE'VE GOTTEN

03:24:39.734 --> 03:24:41.602
MONEY FROM THE FED ZIDAN YEAH

03:24:41.669 --> 03:24:43.471
THE FIRST TEARS ACT AND OTHER

03:24:43.537 --> 03:24:44.639
TYPES OF THINGS WE'RE GONNA GET

03:24:44.705 --> 03:24:46.574
MORE MONEY. BUT AS WE ARE DOING

03:24:46.641 --> 03:24:48.476
OUR HEARINGS ALL RIGHT NOW HERE

03:24:48.542 --> 03:24:49.577

PLANNING THIS BUDGET WE DIDN'T.

03:24:51.379 --> 03:24:52.713
KNOW WHAT WAS GONNA HAPPEN THE

03:24:52.780 --> 03:24:53.848
SECOND STIMULUS WHICH BY THE

03:24:53.914 --> 03:24:55.149
WAY IS PASSED BY ABOUT LESS

03:24:55.216 --> 03:24:57.885
THAN TWO WEEKS AGO- WE- I THINK

03:24:57.952 --> 03:24:59.520
IT'S GONNA BE IMPORTANT THAT WE

03:24:59.587 --> 03:25:01.789
ACTUALLY HAVE. ACCURATE

03:25:01.856 --> 03:25:03.124
INFORMATION ABOUT EXACTLY HOW

03:25:03.190 --> 03:25:05.626
MUCH MONEY ACTUALLY WE AND WE

03:25:05.693 --> 03:25:07.061
ACTUALLY HAVE TO WORK WITH

03:25:07.128 --> 03:25:08.729
BETWEEN BOTH FEDERAL AND STATE

03:25:08.796 --> 03:25:09.997
AND CERTAINLY HELP HIM SERVE AS

03:25:10.064 --> 03:25:11.165
WE ALLOW FEDERAL MATCHING MONEY

03:25:11.232 --> 03:25:13.200
AND STUFF BUT TAX. THINGS SO WE

03:25:13.267 --> 03:25:16.103
KNOW WHETHER WE'RE DOING THE

03:25:16.170 --> 03:25:18.339
RIGHT AMOUNT AND- TEN AND SO I

03:25:18.406 --> 03:25:20.808

03:25:25.413 --> 03:25:26.480
YOU'RE GONNA MAKE ADJUSTMENTS

03:25:26.547 --> 03:25:27.615
IN MAY REVISED BUT WE'RE

03:25:27.682 --> 03:25:28.716
LOOKING AT SOME THINGS YOU

03:25:28.783 --> 03:25:30.484
WANNA MOVE OUT NOW. ARE CODED

03:25:30.551 --> 03:25:32.553

BE SHARING WITH THIS COMMITTEE

03:25:35.523 --> 03:25:37.291
AND OUR SUBCOMMITTEES. ON THE

03:25:37.358 --> 03:25:38.459
AMOUNT OF FEDERAL MONEY THAT

03:25:38.526 --> 03:25:40.194
WE'VE RECEIVED BOTH TO DATE AND

03:25:40.261 --> 03:25:44.065
WE ANTICIPATE. PARTICULARLY TO.

03:25:44.131 --> 03:25:45.299
IN MY MIND PUBLIC HEALTH

03:25:45.366 --> 03:25:46.333
BECAUSE THAT'S THE TIP OF THE

03:25:46.400 --> 03:25:47.868
SPEAR BUT ALSO THE OTHER THINGS

03:25:47.935 --> 03:25:49.804
AS WELL SO. YOU KNOW I GET IT

03:25:49.870 --> 03:25:51.172
YOU'RE SAYING NOW OKAY WE

03:25:51.238 --> 03:25:52.139
DEVELOP THIS BUDGET THAT'S

03:25:52.206 --> 03:25:53.040
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT I THINK OUR

03:25:53.107 --> 03:25:54.508
DISCUSSION ABOUT THE BUDGET

03:25:54.575 --> 03:25:56.110
CAN'T JUST BE CONSTRAINED ONLY

03:25:56.177 --> 03:25:57.078
TO WHAT'S BEING PROPOSED BY THE

03:25:57.144 --> 03:25:58.746
GOVERNOR AND WHAT WE ARE SPEND

03:25:58.813 --> 03:25:59.547
STATE MONEY ON. WE HAVE TO

03:25:59.613 --> 03:26:01.148
KNOW. THE COLLECTIVE AMOUNT OF

03:26:01.215 --> 03:26:03.184
MONEY THAT'S AVAILABLE SOME OF

03:26:03.250 --> 03:26:04.051
IT OF COURSE THE FEDERAL

03:26:04.118 --> 03:26:05.352
GOVERNMENT WILL SPECIFICALLY

03:26:05.419 --> 03:26:06.454
DESIGNATED FOR CERTAIN THINGS

03:26:06.520 --> 03:26:08.189
SO WE CAN'T REALLY CONTROL THAT

03:26:08.255 --> 03:26:09.156
BUT WE AT LEAST NEED TO KNOW

03:26:09.223 --> 03:26:11.859
WHAT. TOKEN CAN BOTH- FINANCE

03:26:11.926 --> 03:26:14.228
IN ELLO. SPEAK TO ARE YOU GOING

03:26:14.295 --> 03:26:15.296
TO BE WHEN YOU'RE AT A SUB

03:26:15.362 --> 03:26:17.131
COMMITTEE HEARINGS AND ALSO WE

03:26:17.198 --> 03:26:17.631
HAVE A BUDGET COMMITTEE

03:26:17.698 --> 03:26:19.500
HEARINGS. THEN WE'LL HAVE A

03:26:19.567 --> 03:26:21.035
MORE DETAILED CONVERSATION AND

03:26:21.102 --> 03:26:22.169
ACTUALLY GIVE US THAT

03:26:22.236 --> 03:26:23.504
INFORMATION WE HAVE THOSE

03:26:23.571 --> 03:26:26.907
HEARING SO WE CAN MAKE THE

03:26:26.974 --> 03:26:28.776
RIGHT DECISIONS. ON RESOURCES.

DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO.

IMPORTANT PART OF YOUR

03:28:56.857 --> 03:28:59.593

WEIGH IN ON THOSE CHOICES SO-

03:29:06.734 --> 03:29:07.868

COLLEAGUES FROM FROM THE L. A.

03:29:09.737 --> 03:29:13.274
WOULD WANT. TO SUPPLEMENT

ANYTHING AT SAID ON THAT. OKAY

03:29:19.480 --> 03:29:20.981
SO- AND I APPRECIATE THAT

03:29:21.048 --> 03:29:22.616
RESPONSE I THINK TO SAY NOW

03:29:22.683 --> 03:29:24.318
APROPOS TO WHAT- I THINK CENTER

03:29:24.385 --> 03:29:27.655
CRAZY ASKED A LITTLE EARLIER-

03:29:27.721 --> 03:29:30.190
IT IS THE- THIS BRANCHES JOB TO

03:29:30.257 --> 03:29:31.992
APPROPRIATE- AND WILD WE DON'T

03:29:32.059 --> 03:29:34.061
TECHNICALLY APPROPRIATE. THE

03:29:34.128 --> 03:29:37.631
FEDERAL MONEY DIRECTLY- I WOULD

03:29:37.698 --> 03:29:39.566
SAY THAT IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT

03:29:39.633 --> 03:29:41.001
ADMINISTRATION VIEW US AS

03:29:41.068 --> 03:29:43.237
PARTNERS AND DEBT ALLOCATION

03:29:43.304 --> 03:29:44.538
THAT IT'S NOT LIKE- IT'S

03:29:44.605 --> 03:29:45.706
FEDERAL MONEY AND THEREFORE WE

03:29:45.773 --> 03:29:47.241
CAN ALLOCATE THAT WE WANT TO

03:29:47.308 --> 03:29:48.943
WITHOUT TALKING TO YOU KNOW AT.

03:29:49.009 --> 03:29:50.277
YOU'LL YOU'LL LET US KNOW I'M

03:29:50.344 --> 03:29:50.878
SURE WE'RE GOOD PARTNERS IN

03:29:50.945 --> 03:29:53.013
THAT SENSE BUT- I THINK YOU

03:29:53.080 --> 03:29:54.248
KNOW WE NEED TO BE ENGAGED IN

03:29:54.315 --> 03:29:56.116
THOSE DECISIONS. RIGHT SO WE

03:29:56.183 --> 03:29:57.151
KNOW WE HAVE CERTAIN FEDERAL

03:29:57.217 --> 03:29:58.419
MONEY'S GOING AND WE'RE TRYING

03:29:58.485 --> 03:29:59.086
TO MAKE DECISIONS ON HOW

03:29:59.153 --> 03:30:01.255
ALLOCATE. DEL APPROPRIATE STATE

03:30:01.322 --> 03:30:02.923
MONEY WE DIDN'T NEED TO KNOW

03:30:02.990 --> 03:30:03.791
WHAT KIND OF DECISIONS THE

03:30:03.857 --> 03:30:05.159
ADMINISTRATION'S PLAN TO MAKE

03:30:05.225 --> 03:30:06.894
ON THE FEDERAL MONEY SO WE DO

03:30:06.961 --> 03:30:08.662
SO WE DON'T FIND OUT THAT- WE

03:30:08.729 --> 03:30:10.097
APPROPRIATE THE STATE MONEY AND

03:30:10.164 --> 03:30:11.298
NOW WE HAVE THIS MUCH GOING ON

03:30:11.365 --> 03:30:12.599
THE FEDERAL SIDE AND THEN

03:30:12.666 --> 03:30:14.201
THERE'S A HOLE SOMEWHERE ELSE.

03:30:14.268 --> 03:30:16.870
SO I THINK THAT. WE NEED TO BE

03:30:16.937 --> 03:30:18.339
LOOKING AT LANGUAGE REGARDING

03:30:18.405 --> 03:30:20.708
THAT AS WELL- I WOULD ALSO SAY

03:30:20.774 --> 03:30:22.076
THAT I KNOW EARLIER WE TALKED A

03:30:22.142 --> 03:30:23.544
LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT IS THAT

03:30:23.610 --> 03:30:25.212
TRAILER LYFT I DON'T I THINK

03:30:25.279 --> 03:30:26.981
THAT'S- RIGHT I THINK LAST YEAR

03:30:27.047 --> 03:30:28.682
WE SORT OF ACCEPTED IT BUT I

03:30:28.749 --> 03:30:30.050
HOPE THAT THIS YEAR WE REVISIT

03:30:30.117 --> 03:30:31.385
THAT AS WELL I THINK WE DO NEED

03:30:31.452 --> 03:30:33.187
MORE CONTROLS ON THE- ON THE-

03:30:33.253 --> 03:30:34.955
LEGISLATIVE SIDE. I WOULD POINT

03:30:35.022 --> 03:30:35.622

03:30:35.689 --> 03:30:37.558
EMERGENCY BUT THIS IS. AN

03:30:37.624 --> 03:30:39.259

03:30:42.262 --> 03:30:44.365

SPECIFIC THINGS I MAY DELVE

03:30:53.974 --> 03:30:55.776
INTO IT- SO FIRST OF ALL DID

03:30:55.843 --> 03:30:56.744
