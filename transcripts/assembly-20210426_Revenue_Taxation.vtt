YOU HAD MADE A HUNDRED THOUSAND

00:44:05.709 --> 00:44:06.276

THAT UP ON THAT INCOME AND I

00:44:18.889 --> 00:44:19.490
THINK THAT'S THE THAT'S THE

00:44:19.556 --> 00:44:25.362
FIRST. A IN CALIFORNIA THERE

00:44:25.429 --> 00:44:28.132
SHOULD HAVE BEEN AWFUL CAN- THE

00:44:28.198 --> 00:44:29.233
MAIN THE ONE QUESTION I HAVE

00:44:29.299 --> 00:44:31.702
AND- INSIDE A NEW CARL CARDIO.

00:44:31.769 --> 00:44:36.473
SO LETTER IT SAYS- IN REGARDS

00:44:36.540 --> 00:44:38.542
TO A 25% REDUCTION OVER A THREE

00:44:38.609 --> 00:44:39.576
MONTH PERIOD OF TIME OVER A

00:44:39.643 --> 00:44:41.545
QUARTER WHICH IS THE LANGUAGE I

00:44:41.612 --> 00:44:42.980
BELIEVE IN THE SECOND PPP

00:44:43.047 --> 00:44:46.517
ALONE- IS IT THERE ARE 25%

00:44:46.583 --> 00:44:48.452
REDUCTION PER QUARTER OR JUST

00:44:48.519 --> 00:44:49.286
25% REDUCTION IN GROSS

00:44:49.353 --> 00:44:52.022
RECEIPTS. YOUR OVER YOUR FROM

00:44:52.089 --> 00:44:53.924
THE PREVIOUS YEAR. ALL RIGHT SO

00:44:53.991 --> 00:44:59.730
MANY. NO NO I HAVE I'VE SEVERAL

00:44:59.797 --> 00:45:01.065
QUESTIONS SO I TRYING TO GO

00:45:01.131 --> 00:45:02.266
THROUGH THE ALL FIRST DIDN'T

00:45:02.332 --> 00:45:03.901
FOR THE CLARIFICATION PURPOSES

00:45:03.967 --> 00:45:07.237
WE DIDN'T DISPLAY WE HAD A AB

00:45:07.304 --> 00:45:08.072
EIGHTY THE SENATE SIDE WE IT

00:45:08.138 --> 00:45:09.740
BECAUSE WE GOT. BECAUSE THE

00:45:09.807 --> 00:45:11.341
BILL BILL MUCH AND WE GOT THE

00:45:11.408 --> 00:45:11.975
SENSE THAT WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO

00:45:12.042 --> 00:45:13.710
GET CLOSER TO FULL CONFORMITY

00:45:13.777 --> 00:45:17.714
WHICH WAS THE ORIGINAL GOAL- WE

00:45:17.781 --> 00:45:18.315
PULLED THE BILL WHEN WE GOT.

00:45:18.382 --> 00:45:18.949
THIS THAT WE COULD GET A LITTLE

00:45:19.016 --> 00:45:20.050
BIT MORE SO WE DIDN'T START

00:45:20.117 --> 00:45:22.086
LATE WE STARTED. WHEN OTHER

00:45:22.152 --> 00:45:24.121
STATES BEGAN BUT WE- WE WANTED

00:45:24.188 --> 00:45:25.089
TO GET AS CLOSE TO FULL

00:45:25.155 --> 00:45:26.957
CONFORMITY AS WE COULD GET FROM

00:45:27.024 --> 00:45:28.792
THE ADMINISTRATION- SO THAT'S

00:45:28.859 --> 00:45:30.294
THE FIRST THING. THE SECOND

00:45:30.360 --> 00:45:31.962
PART IS YES WE DID ONE FULL

00:45:32.029 --> 00:45:33.464
CONFORMITY THE REGIONAL BILL IS

00:45:33.530 --> 00:45:34.932
TWO BILLION WE HAVE NOT XBEE

00:45:34.998 --> 00:45:36.733
HAVE NOW EXPANDED UP TO SIX

00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:37.935
BILLION WHICH WILL ACTUALLY

00:45:38.001 --> 00:45:39.169
INCLUDE CLUED PER THE

00:45:39.236 --> 00:45:40.737
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE BETWEEN

00:45:40.804 --> 00:45:43.674
SEVENTY FIVE AND 85% OF THOSE

00:45:43.740 --> 00:45:45.175
WHO GOT THE LOANS. SO AND THEN

00:45:45.242 --> 00:45:48.078
ON THE 25% GROUP. THE 25% THE

00:45:48.145 --> 00:45:49.746
WAY WE'VE CHOSE IT WAS BECAUSE

00:45:49.813 --> 00:45:51.281
THE SECOND ROUND OF FUNDING

00:45:51.348 --> 00:45:54.418
REQUIRED THAT 25% LOSS. SO

00:45:54.485 --> 00:45:55.652
THAT'S HOW WE CAME TO THAT

00:45:55.719 --> 00:45:57.488
NUMBER WAS THAT. INSTEAD OF

00:45:57.554 --> 00:45:59.089
DOING WE HAD MANY INTEGRATIONS

00:45:59.156 --> 00:46:00.691
COME TO US MANY SUGGESTIONS

00:46:00.757 --> 00:46:02.226
FROM THE ADMINISTRATION.

00:46:02.292 --> 00:46:04.695
SELECTING INDUSTRIES NARROWING

00:46:04.761 --> 00:46:06.263
IT WE DIDN'T WANT TO DO THAT I

00:46:06.330 --> 00:46:07.297
DIDN'T WANT TO PUT THE MEMBERS

00:46:07.364 --> 00:46:08.932
BACK IN A SITUATION WERE

00:46:08.999 --> 00:46:11.468
PICKING. REALLY DEFINED WINNERS

00:46:11.535 --> 00:46:12.402
AND LOSERS WHERE WE WERE SAYING

00:46:12.469 --> 00:46:14.104
THAT IT WAS. OKAY FOR DOCTORS

00:46:14.171 --> 00:46:16.073
BUT NOT BE TITIAN'S OR WHATEVER

00:46:16.140 --> 00:46:17.307
THE CASE MAY BE OUR GOLF

00:46:17.374 --> 00:46:19.009
COURSES WE WOULD GET IT AND-

00:46:19.076 --> 00:46:20.511
ATTORNEYS WANT WHATEVER IT WAS

00:46:20.577 --> 00:46:22.379
WE WANTED TO MAKE IT. AS

00:46:22.446 --> 00:46:24.248
CONSISTENT. AS WELL AS

00:46:24.314 --> 00:46:26.250
CONSISTENT WITH THE FEDERAL LAW

00:46:26.316 --> 00:46:27.851
IS WE COULD AND- ON THE LAST

00:46:27.918 --> 00:46:29.286
POINT WE ARE NOT ACTUALLY

00:46:29.353 --> 00:46:30.821
TAXING THE GRANTS WE ARE

00:46:30.888 --> 00:46:33.390
DISALLOWING. THE DEDUCTION FOR

00:46:33.457 --> 00:46:34.858
THOSE PAYMENTS SO WE'RE NOT

00:46:34.925 --> 00:46:35.659
ACTUALLY TAXING GRANT SUGGESTS

00:46:35.726 --> 00:46:37.828
OKAY SO NOW YOUR NEXT QUESTION

00:46:37.895 --> 00:46:39.496
IS GO AHEAD. I'M GONNA KEEP

00:46:39.563 --> 00:46:44.268
TRYING TO RUN. NO I'VE AND THE

00:46:44.334 --> 00:46:45.736
REASON IT'S A IS THAT THE- WAS.

00:46:45.802 --> 00:46:46.737
IS A TWO FIVE PER READ. PER

00:46:46.803 --> 00:46:47.771
CORE. OR TWENTY FIVE PER RATE.

00:46:47.838 --> 00:46:50.374
YEAR OVER YEAR. I DON'T I'M NOT

00:46:50.440 --> 00:46:51.208
SURE FOR THE TWENTY PRIVATE

00:46:51.275 --> 00:46:52.776
ACTION A RECORDER YEAR YEAR BUT

00:46:52.843 --> 00:46:55.212
ANY KIND. WITH THE FEDERAL LAW

00:46:55.279 --> 00:46:56.113
WITH THE SECOND ROUND OF GRANTS

00:46:56.180 --> 00:46:57.181
IF I UNDERSTAND UP TO THE

00:46:57.247 --> 00:46:58.282
SECOND ROUND OF GRANTS THE

00:46:58.348 --> 00:47:00.184

ORANGES. I UNDERSTAND THE

00:47:05.155 --> 00:47:07.357
FORMULAS 25% RATE SO IF

00:47:07.424 --> 00:47:08.225
SOMEBODY WANTED TO GET THE

00:47:08.292 --> 00:47:10.160
SECOND PPP ALONE THEY WOULD HAD

00:47:10.227 --> 00:47:12.529

WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE WE'RE

00:50:34.197 --> 00:50:36.967
ALLOWING THE DEDUCTION. I JUST

00:50:37.033 --> 00:50:38.468
WANNA MAKE SURE LIKE WE- J. IS

00:50:38.535 --> 00:50:43.173
THAT CORRECT. YEAH THAT THAT'S

00:50:43.240 --> 00:50:44.841
EXACTLY CORRECT. THIS IS A TAX

00:50:44.908 --> 00:50:46.443
BENEFIT THAT WE ARE GIVING TO

00:50:46.510 --> 00:50:48.779
TAXPAYERS IN THE CONFORMITY AND

00:50:48.845 --> 00:50:51.281
SO INTENSE IT OFF IT'S NOT IT'S

00:50:51.348 --> 00:50:53.183
NOT HARMING THE REGISTRY SO

00:50:53.250 --> 00:50:54.951
THOSE WHO DON'T QUALIFY FOR THE

00:50:55.018 --> 00:50:55.752
CONFORMITY OR JUST GETTING

00:50:55.819 --> 00:50:56.887
TREATED THE WAY THEY WOULD

00:50:56.953 --> 00:50:59.389
NORMALLY BE TREATED UNDER UNDER

00:50:59.456 --> 00:51:02.292
TAX LAW. I THINK IF I CAN JUST

00:51:02.359 --> 00:51:04.027
ONE MORE ONE MORE QUESTION HOW

00:51:04.094 --> 00:51:07.230
MANY STATES- THAT HOW MANY

00:51:07.297 --> 00:51:09.499
STATES. ARE ALLOWING FULL

00:51:09.566 --> 00:51:11.902
CONFORMITY AND HOW MANY STATES

00:51:11.968 --> 00:51:15.739
ARE SAYING. THAT WERE USES 25%

00:51:15.806 --> 00:51:16.673
THRESHOLD. THE A HARD TO ANSWER

00:51:16.740 --> 00:51:18.108
RIGHT NOW BECAUSE SO MANY OF US

00:51:18.175 --> 00:51:19.576
FELL INTO THIS PROBLEM WITH THE

00:51:19.643 --> 00:51:21.578
U. S. TREASURY RIGHT SO WHEN WE

00:51:21.645 --> 00:51:23.547
FIRST STARTED THIS BILL.

00:51:23.613 --> 00:51:24.548
ALTHOUGH WE DID WE WERE NOT

00:51:24.614 --> 00:51:25.782
PROVIDING FULL CONFORMITY YOU

00:51:25.849 --> 00:51:26.716
WERE ALLOWED TO PROVIDE FULL

00:51:26.783 --> 00:51:28.919
CONFORMITY MOST STATES ARE A

00:51:28.985 --> 00:51:29.653
LOT OF STATES EXCEPT FOR A

00:51:29.719 --> 00:51:31.822
HANDFUL. HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR

00:51:31.888 --> 00:51:32.889
PERMISSION FROM THE U. S.

00:51:32.956 --> 00:51:35.125

WITHOUT LOSING OUR FEDERAL

00:51:37.527 --> 00:51:39.262
FUNDING. SO ANSWERING THAT

00:51:39.329 --> 00:51:40.397
QUESTION I DON'T THINK IT'S

00:51:40.464 --> 00:51:42.699

IT HONESTLY I THINK OR IF WE

00:51:45.335 --> 00:51:46.570
ANSWERED HONESTLY I THINK YOU

00:51:46.636 --> 00:51:47.270

00:51:47.337 --> 00:51:48.839
YOU'RE TRYING TO GET TO.

00:51:48.905 --> 00:51:50.540
BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T BECAUSE ALL

00:51:52.242 --> 00:51:53.844
IN BEING PUT ON HOLD. OTHER

00:51:53.910 --> 00:51:55.979
STATES ARIZONA OTHER STATES

00:51:56.046 --> 00:51:57.581
WERE PUT ON HOLD LIKE WE WERE.

00:51:57.647 --> 00:51:59.616
BECAUSE OF THE BECAUSE OF THE

00:51:59.683 --> 00:52:01.551
PASSING OF THE KOPET ACT. THE

00:52:01.618 --> 00:52:05.055

WHILE THE TAX DEDUCTION. IS NOT

00:57:54.037 --> 00:57:55.438
A TAX. IF YOU ARE NOT A TO IF

00:57:55.505 --> 00:57:57.040
YOU'RE DEDUCTING TEN THOUSAND

00:57:57.106 --> 00:57:58.908
DOLLARS COULD YOU GET A CREDIT

00:57:58.975 --> 00:58:00.410
OR DEBIT TAX DEDUCTION. AND

00:58:00.476 --> 00:58:02.045
THAT'S NOT ALLOWED THEN YOU'RE

00:58:02.111 --> 00:58:03.746

SO THERE IS. AN AMOUNT OF TAX

00:58:10.854 --> 00:58:14.724
THAT DOES HAPPEN- BUT- BECAUSE

00:58:14.791 --> 00:58:16.092
OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WE

00:58:16.159 --> 00:58:17.794
ARE IN RIGHT NOW. THERE IS A

INCOME AS WE'VE SEEN SIMILAR

01:17:24.006 --> 01:17:26.341
ITERATIONS OF A STIMULUS. CASH

01:17:26.408 --> 01:17:27.542
PAYMENTS GOING DIRECTLY TO

01:17:27.609 --> 01:17:29.211
INDIVIDUALS ON THIS WOULD BE A

01:17:29.277 --> 01:17:31.246
SIMILAR TYPE OF INTEGRATION OF

01:17:31.313 --> 01:17:32.180
THE THOUSAND DOLLAR BENEFITS

01:17:32.247 --> 01:17:34.116
AS- REFLECT IN THE COMING NOW

01:17:34.182 --> 01:17:34.983
SAYS THEIR NUMBER OF ISSUES

01:17:35.050 --> 01:17:36.284
THAT HAVE BEEN OUTLINED. I'M

01:17:36.351 --> 01:17:37.686
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT ESPECIALLY

01:17:37.753 --> 01:17:39.221
AS I'VE INTRODUCED THIS

01:17:39.287 --> 01:17:40.622
ACTUALLY FOR THE SECOND YEAR

01:17:40.689 --> 01:17:41.523
HAVE REQUESTED A SELECT

01:17:41.590 --> 01:17:43.091
COMMITTEE ON THIS TO HELP FOR

01:17:43.158 --> 01:17:44.693
THE IRON OUT SOME OF THE POLICY

01:17:44.760 --> 01:17:46.561
ISSUES. OF THIS COMMITTEE-

01:17:46.628 --> 01:17:47.629
STRIPPED OUT THE FUNDING

01:17:47.696 --> 01:17:49.598
MECHANISM TOWARDS IT- AND SO

01:17:49.664 --> 01:17:51.666
THIS PROVIDES US AN OPPORTUNITY

01:17:51.733 --> 01:17:52.534
TO TALK ABOUT THE POLICY ABOUT

01:17:52.601 --> 01:17:54.069
THE IMPLEMENTATION. WE GIVEN

01:17:54.136 --> 01:17:55.737
THAT OF THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD

01:17:55.804 --> 01:17:57.172
AND ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS

01:17:57.239 --> 01:17:58.573
AND HOW INDIVIDUALS WITHIN

01:17:58.640 --> 01:18:00.142
RECEIVE SUCH BASIC INCOME

01:18:00.208 --> 01:18:02.010
PAYMENTS- SO THAT IS THE

01:18:02.077 --> 01:18:03.311
PROPOSAL THAT WE HAVE BEFORE US

01:18:03.378 --> 01:18:05.047
WHICH IS THAT OF. AND GIVING

01:18:05.113 --> 01:18:06.214
THAT AUTHORITY TO THE FRANCHISE

01:18:06.281 --> 01:18:08.150
TAX BOARD ON THE ELIGIBILITY OF

01:18:08.216 --> 01:18:09.451
INDIVIDUALS TO RECEIVE THESE

01:18:09.518 --> 01:18:10.919
CASH PAYMENTS WORKING THAT

01:18:10.986 --> 01:18:12.587
THROUGH THIS COMMITTEE TO BEST

01:18:12.654 --> 01:18:13.755
DETERMINE WHAT THAT WOULD LOOK

01:18:13.822 --> 01:18:15.123
LIKE. AND WHETHER OR NOT THERE

01:18:15.190 --> 01:18:16.358
IS THE ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS

01:18:16.425 --> 01:18:17.993
AS REFLECT IN THE ANALYSIS

01:18:18.060 --> 01:18:19.661
DEMONSTRATES THAT OF THIS THIS

01:18:19.728 --> 01:18:21.596
CONFLICT WITH OTHER TYPE OF

01:18:21.663 --> 01:18:23.165
SOCIAL SAFETY NET PROGRAMS AND

01:18:23.231 --> 01:18:25.200
HAVE ANOTHER SIMILAR- SISTER

01:18:25.267 --> 01:18:26.401
BILL TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS

01:18:26.468 --> 01:18:27.702
DOES NOT COMPETE THAT STACKED

01:18:27.769 --> 01:18:29.304
WITH. ADDITIONAL PROGRAMS WE

01:18:29.371 --> 01:18:30.372
DON'T WANT THE UNINTENDED

01:18:30.439 --> 01:18:32.441
CONSEQUENCES INDIVIDUALS NOT TO

01:18:32.507 --> 01:18:34.409
BE ELIGIBLE FOR OTHER SOCIAL

01:18:34.476 --> 01:18:36.078
SAFETY NET PROGRAMS TO ALSO

01:18:36.144 --> 01:18:38.146
RECEIVE THESE PAYMENTS AS WELL

01:18:38.213 --> 01:18:40.015
TOO SO. AS WE HAVE THE BILL

01:18:40.082 --> 01:18:44.319
BEFORE US THAT'S TO GIVE THE

01:18:44.386 --> 01:18:44.820
FRANCHISE TAX BOARD THAT

01:18:44.886 --> 01:18:46.655
AUTHORITY. AND SO THE PROPOSAL.

01:18:46.721 --> 01:18:47.989
AS I UNDERSTAND IT IS THAT

01:18:48.056 --> 01:18:48.857
WOULD BE A THOUSAND DOLLAR

01:18:48.924 --> 01:18:50.792
MONTH PAYMENT FOR ANY

01:18:50.859 --> 01:18:52.894
CALIFORNIANS OVER THE AGE OF

01:18:52.961 --> 01:18:53.995
EIGHTEEN WITH SOME EXCLUSIONS

01:18:54.062 --> 01:18:57.065
BURNING MORE. THAT 2100% OR

01:18:57.132 --> 01:18:58.533
LESS OF THE MEDIAN RENTS FOR

01:18:58.600 --> 01:19:00.469
THE DISTRICTS SO- YOU MENTION

01:19:00.535 --> 01:19:02.137
THERE ISN'T A FUNDING MECHANISM

01:19:02.204 --> 01:19:02.704
AND IT IS SUBJECT TO

01:19:02.771 --> 01:19:04.840
APPROPRIATION BUT WHAT WHAT IS

01:19:04.906 --> 01:19:07.943
THE ESTIMATE OF. THE. ANNUAL

01:19:08.009 --> 01:19:09.845
COST OF A PROGRAM OF THAT. YOU

01:19:09.911 --> 01:19:11.613
SIGNIFICANT- AND THAT THAT IS

01:19:11.680 --> 01:19:12.914
PART OF THE CONVERSATION THAT

01:19:12.981 --> 01:19:14.449
WE THAT I HAVE BEFORE US WHICH

01:19:14.516 --> 01:19:15.851
IS TO HAVE A POLICY

01:19:15.917 --> 01:19:17.586
CONVERSATION TO SEE WHAT THE

01:19:17.652 --> 01:19:18.787
IMPLEMENTATION WILL LOOK LIKE

01:19:18.854 --> 01:19:20.288
AND WHAT THE COST WOULD BE THE

01:19:20.355 --> 01:19:22.457
DETERMINANT BUT HAN WHO WOULD

01:19:22.524 --> 01:19:24.159
BE ELIGIBLE FOR THAT TYPE OF

01:19:24.226 --> 01:19:25.660
CALIFORNIANS WHO WHAT TYPE OF

01:19:25.727 --> 01:19:26.595
CALIFORNIA'S ALREADY IN

01:19:26.661 --> 01:19:28.497
EXISTING PROGRAMS ALREADY HOW

01:19:28.563 --> 01:19:30.031
DOES THIS WORK IN IN

01:19:30.098 --> 01:19:32.167
COMPLEMENTARY WAS IT STACKED.

01:19:32.234 --> 01:19:33.902
ALSO IDENTIFYING WHAT OTHER

01:19:33.969 --> 01:19:35.303
LOCAL CITIES ARE DOING AND HOW

01:19:35.370 --> 01:19:37.606
THAT IS IN COMPLEMENT TO WHAT

01:19:37.672 --> 01:19:39.574
THEY'RE DOING AS WELL. SO IF MY

01:19:39.641 --> 01:19:40.942
MATH IS RIGHT AND IT MIGHT BE

01:19:41.009 --> 01:19:42.244
WRONG BUT IF MY MATH IS RIGHT I

01:19:42.310 --> 01:19:43.478
THINK THIS IS LIKE TWO HUNDRED

01:19:43.545 --> 01:19:44.513
BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR WHICH

01:19:44.579 --> 01:19:46.348
IS. THE CLEARLY WOULD BE A

01:19:46.414 --> 01:19:47.883
DOUBLING OF OUR STATE'S BUDGET

01:19:47.949 --> 01:19:49.284
IS THAT KIND OF BALLPARK WHAT

01:19:49.351 --> 01:19:50.652
DO YOU THINK IT IS IT IS A

01:19:50.719 --> 01:19:52.654
LARGE AMOUNT YES AND IT IS A

01:19:52.721 --> 01:19:54.356
SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT. YES AND

01:19:54.422 --> 01:19:55.957
THAT'S WHY I THINK- THAT I

01:19:56.024 --> 01:19:58.193
APPRECIATE THAT THE CHAIRS AND

01:19:58.260 --> 01:20:00.929
I'M TOTALLY STRIPPED. THAT'S

01:20:00.996 --> 01:20:01.663

01:20:58.753 --> 01:21:00.889
THE FIRST TIME THAT BRADY SO

01:21:00.956 --> 01:21:01.456
AND WE'VE SEEN A NUMBER OF

01:21:01.523 --> 01:21:03.959
OTHER PILOTS. IN MANY CITIES IN

01:21:04.025 --> 01:21:05.093
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA I'M

01:21:05.160 --> 01:21:07.829
GETTING AT HERE IS. E. ADD UP

01:21:07.896 --> 01:21:09.364
THE NUMBER OF EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD

01:21:09.431 --> 01:21:10.832
GRADUATES FROM ALL THESE

01:21:10.899 --> 01:21:11.866
DIFFERENT STATES I DON'T HAVE

01:21:11.933 --> 01:21:14.002
IT. IN CALIFORNIA IS OFFERING

01:21:14.069 --> 01:21:15.370
YOU TWELVE THOUSAND DOLLARS A

01:21:15.437 --> 01:21:17.038
YEAR TO COME HANG OUT HERE WE

01:21:17.105 --> 01:21:19.574
DON'T HAVE JOBS FOR THEM WE

01:21:19.641 --> 01:21:20.542
DON'T HAVE HOUSES FOR THEM.

01:21:20.609 --> 01:21:21.409
THAT'S PART OF THE POLICY

01:21:21.476 --> 01:21:23.078
DISCUSSION THAT YOU NEED TO

01:21:23.144 --> 01:21:25.847
HAVE ABOUT THIS- IS WHAT DO YOU

01:21:25.914 --> 01:21:27.382
DO WITH ALL OF THE PEOPLE THAT

01:21:27.449 --> 01:21:28.650
YOU ARE LOWERING FROM OTHER

01:21:28.717 --> 01:21:29.884
STATES THAT NOW BECOME

01:21:29.951 --> 01:21:32.087
CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS. THAT WE

01:21:32.153 --> 01:21:33.455
DON'T EVEN HAVE ENOUGH JOBS FOR

01:21:33.521 --> 01:21:35.323
THE ONES THAT WE HAVE HERE NOW.

01:21:35.390 --> 01:21:38.627
WE DON'T HAVE HOUSES WERE THE-ONES WE HAVE HERE NOW. SO THAT

01:21:38.693 --> 01:21:40.562
IS A HUGE CONCERN ESPECIALLY IF

01:21:40.629 --> 01:21:41.763
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A TWO

01:21:41.830 --> 01:21:43.431
HUNDRED BILLION DOLLAR PRICE

01:21:43.498 --> 01:21:45.000
TAG ON SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

01:21:45.066 --> 01:21:47.068
BECAUSE THE ONLY WAY TO GET TWO

01:21:47.135 --> 01:21:49.738
HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS IS TO.

01:21:49.804 --> 01:21:51.406
EXPAND THE ECONOMY THAT'S GONNA

01:21:51.473 --> 01:21:53.341
TAKE A WHILE GIVEN OUR

01:21:53.408 --> 01:21:54.776
CIRCUMVENT RESEARCH- I CURRENT

01:21:54.843 --> 01:21:57.946
CIRCUMSTANCES AND SO THAT'S NOT

01:21:58.013 --> 01:21:59.981
GONNA HAPPEN AND- YEAH IT

01:22:00.048 --> 01:22:01.816
FRANKLY TWELVE THOUSAND

01:22:01.883 --> 01:22:04.753
DOLLARS- YOU KNOW GIVING GIVING

01:22:04.819 --> 01:22:06.154
TO EIGHTEEN YEAR OLDS TWELVE

01:22:06.221 --> 01:22:06.821
THOUSAND DOLLARS TO DO WITH

01:22:06.888 --> 01:22:09.391
WHAT THEY WANT- IS KIND OF A

01:22:09.457 --> 01:22:11.860
RECIPE FOR SOCIAL DISASTER. AND

01:22:11.926 --> 01:22:13.695
SO I'M NOT GONNA BE SUPPORTING

01:22:13.762 --> 01:22:14.929
THIS ESPECIALLY IN ITS CURRENT

01:22:14.996 --> 01:22:17.365
FORM I WOULD BE I WOULD BE OPEN

01:22:17.432 --> 01:22:19.734
TO LISTENING TO SOMETHING ABOUT

01:22:19.801 --> 01:22:22.270
REPLACING SOME OF OUR CURRENT-

01:22:22.337 --> 01:22:24.939
THE ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS WITH

01:22:25.006 --> 01:22:26.875
SOMETHING LIKE THIS INSTEAD OF

01:22:26.941 --> 01:22:28.109
HAVING THIS MARY OUT OF

01:22:28.176 --> 01:22:30.111
ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS. BUT THE

01:22:30.178 --> 01:22:32.547
PRICE TAG IS TOO BIG TO LURE IS

01:22:32.614 --> 01:22:34.215
TOO BIG AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT

01:22:34.282 --> 01:22:35.684
FRANKLY THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF

01:22:35.750 --> 01:22:37.018
CALIFORNIA CAN'T HANDLE

01:22:37.085 --> 01:22:39.854

ENVIRONMENT AT THIS TIME SO. I

01:22:48.930 --> 01:22:49.431

DISTRICTS ALL OF US IS ALMOST

01:23:13.688 --> 01:23:15.790
SORT RIGHT THE NOTION THAT

WE'RE GOING TO. DO A PROGRAM

01:23:18.393 --> 01:23:20.161
AND ONE OF THE CHALLENGES OF

01:23:20.228 --> 01:23:22.397
THIS LEGISLATURE- AND THESE

01:23:22.464 --> 01:23:24.599
COMMENTS ARE DIRECTED AT THE

01:23:24.666 --> 01:23:27.435
AUTHOR OF A DESTRUCTIVE BOND.

01:23:27.502 --> 01:23:29.971
IS WE LOVE TO- MAKE LOFTY

01:23:30.038 --> 01:23:33.675
PROMISES TO OUR POLITICAL BASE

01:23:33.742 --> 01:23:34.943
PARTICULARLY MY COLLEAGUES

01:23:35.009 --> 01:23:36.611
THAT- MY PARTY THE DEMOCRATIC

01:23:36.678 --> 01:23:38.580
PARTY WE LOVE TO SUGGEST THINGS

01:23:38.646 --> 01:23:39.714
THAT THAT ARE TOTALLY NOT

01:23:39.781 --> 01:23:41.983
REALISTIC. RIGHT UNIVERSAL

01:23:42.050 --> 01:23:44.018
HEALTHCARE. SINGLE PAYER HERE

01:23:44.085 --> 01:23:45.320
IN CALIFORNIA'S EXAMPLE RIGHT

01:23:45.387 --> 01:23:47.422
JUST OUTRAGEOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY

01:23:47.489 --> 01:23:48.923
THAT THE STATE TAX SYSTEM

01:23:48.990 --> 01:23:51.359
WOULDN'T EVEN SUPPORT. NOT THAT

01:23:51.426 --> 01:23:53.461
IT'S NOT IMPORTANT DISCUSSION.

01:23:53.528 --> 01:23:54.396
RIGHT AT ITS CORE MAKING SURE

01:23:54.462 --> 01:23:56.464
THAT EVERY CALIFORNIA HAS

01:23:56.531 --> 01:24:00.769
HEALTH CARE. BOB IT'S SO. GIVEN

01:24:00.835 --> 01:24:02.404
THAT YOUR BILL DOESN'T HAVE

01:24:02.470 --> 01:24:04.406
FUNDING IN IT STRIP BY THIS

01:24:04.472 --> 01:24:05.874
COMMITTEE MY UNDERSTANDING IS

01:24:05.940 --> 01:24:09.043
THAT CORRECT CORRECT YEAH- I

01:24:09.110 --> 01:24:10.512
WANT I WANT TO TALK FOR MEN

01:24:10.578 --> 01:24:12.313
ABOUT I THINK WHAT YOUR CORE.

01:24:12.380 --> 01:24:14.149
VALUES RIGHT I THINK WHAT YOUR

01:24:14.215 --> 01:24:15.216
CORE VLUES YOU'RE TRYING TO

01:24:15.283 --> 01:24:16.885
MAKE CALIFORNIA MORE AFFORDABLE

01:24:16.951 --> 01:24:18.153
RIGHT BECAUSE I THINK WE ALL

01:24:18.219 --> 01:24:20.054
RECOGNIZE HOW UNAFFORDABLE

01:24:20.121 --> 01:24:22.056
CALIFORNIA CONTINUES TO BECOME

01:24:22.123 --> 01:24:24.526
THE COST OF HOUSING THE COST OF

01:24:24.592 --> 01:24:25.960
LIVING IN CENTER. AND THAT'S

01:24:26.027 --> 01:24:27.996
AND THAT THAT'S SOMETHING WON'T

01:24:28.062 --> 01:24:28.963
WORK WHERE I THINK WE'D FIND A

01:24:29.030 --> 01:24:31.399
LOT OF- COMMON GROUND EVEN EVEN

01:24:31.466 --> 01:24:32.867
WITH OUR FRIENDS ACROSS THE

01:24:32.934 --> 01:24:35.069
AISLE RIGHT HOW DO WE MAKE. THE

01:24:35.136 --> 01:24:37.238
ECONOMY CALIFORNIA WORK BETTER

01:24:37.305 --> 01:24:38.273
ONE OF MY COMPLAINTS IS A

01:24:38.339 --> 01:24:41.776
RURAL. CALIFORNIA IS THAT WE

01:24:41.843 --> 01:24:43.778
SPEND 90% OF OUR TIME HERE IN

01:24:43.845 --> 01:24:45.814
SACRAMENTO SOLVING URBAN

01:24:45.880 --> 01:24:48.049
PROBLEMS. RIGHT AND WHAT I MEAN

01:24:48.116 --> 01:24:51.052
BY THAT IS URBAN COMMUNITIES-

01:24:51.119 --> 01:24:52.253
DON'T BUILD ENOUGH HOUSING TO

01:24:52.320 --> 01:24:54.055
SUPPORT. THEIR COMMUNITIES

01:24:54.122 --> 01:24:55.890
THEIR WORK FORCE AND SUCH GREAT

01:24:55.957 --> 01:24:57.992
CREATE A SUPPLY DEMAND ISSUE

01:24:58.059 --> 01:24:59.828
DRIVE UP THE COST OF HOUSING.

01:24:59.894 --> 01:25:01.529
AND THE ANSWER TO THESE TYPES

01:25:01.596 --> 01:25:02.530
OF PROBLEMS IS ALWAYS YOU KNOW

01:25:02.597 --> 01:25:04.499
SUBSIDIES OR GOVERNMENT MONEY

01:25:04.566 --> 01:25:05.867
AND THINGS THAT THAT THAT

01:25:05.934 --> 01:25:07.969
FUNCTIONALLY. LONG TERM DON'T

01:25:08.036 --> 01:25:11.806
WORK. I'VE OFTEN I THOUGHT WE

01:25:11.873 --> 01:25:17.245
SHOULD RELITIGATE THE WAGE

01:25:17.312 --> 01:25:19.781
MAKE MINIMUM WAGE HAVE THE SAME

01:25:19.848 --> 01:25:23.384
BUYING POWER IN EVERY COMMUNITY.

01:25:23.451 --> 01:25:24.619
BECAUSE WE ALWAYS DO IS WE SELL

01:25:24.686 --> 01:25:26.354
WE PICK A NUMBER THAT WE THINK

01:25:26.421 --> 01:25:27.722
SOUNDS GOOD THE PEOPLE LIKE CAN

01:25:27.789 --> 01:25:29.824
WE GO WHAT THE FIGHT FOR TWELVE

01:25:29.891 --> 01:25:33.294
THE FIGHT FOR FIFTEEN THE FIGHT

01:25:33.361 --> 01:25:33.928
FOR TWENTY EIGHT. BUT WE NEVER

01:25:33.995 --> 01:25:35.630
HAVE AN HONEST DISCUSSION ABOUT

01:25:35.697 --> 01:25:37.665
WHAT IS FIFTEEN DOLLARS BUY. IN

01:25:37.732 --> 01:25:41.970
PALO ALTO. PURSES OUT WATER. OR

01:25:42.036 --> 01:25:45.874
VERSUS PLATTER- IT ENDS AND SO

01:25:45.940 --> 01:25:47.008
I THINK THAT'S THE DISCUSSION

01:25:47.075 --> 01:25:48.176
I'D LIKE TO ENGAGE WITH YOUR

01:25:48.243 --> 01:25:50.812
SAUSAGE HOW DO WE MAKE THINGS

01:25:50.879 --> 01:25:52.881
MORE EQUITABLE THROUGHOUT THE

01:25:52.947 --> 01:25:53.848
STATE RIGHT AND I THINK WE

01:25:53.915 --> 01:25:56.584
START BY NOT VIEWING POLICY

01:25:56.651 --> 01:25:57.619
HERE IN SACRAMENTO TO THE

01:25:57.685 --> 01:26:02.557
MYOPIC LENS OF- CITY. CITY FOLK

01:26:02.624 --> 01:26:08.596
CITY COMMUNITY. RIGHT- AND SO.

01:26:08.663 --> 01:26:09.697
I'M GONNA LISTEN TO THE REST OF

01:26:09.764 --> 01:26:11.099
THE DISCUSSION AND I'M GONNA

01:26:11.165 --> 01:26:12.834
TRY TO MAINTAIN AN OPEN HEART

01:26:12.901 --> 01:26:15.069
AND OPEN MIND ABOUT WHERE YOUR

01:26:15.136 --> 01:26:16.804
MOTIVATIONS ARE AND MAYBE KEEP

01:26:16.871 --> 01:26:19.774
THIS DISCUSSION GOING- BUT I

01:26:19.841 --> 01:26:21.309
GOTTA SAY THE NOTION OF A

01:26:21.376 --> 01:26:24.112
UNIVERSAL BASIC INCOME- I

01:26:24.178 --> 01:26:26.014
PERSONALLY DON'T THINK- MAKES

01:26:26.080 --> 01:26:29.083
LOTS OF SENSE I THINK IF WE'RE

01:26:29.150 --> 01:26:29.651
GONNA GO DOWN THAT ROUTE WE

01:26:29.717 --> 01:26:32.320
NEED TO. TAKE A DEEP LOOK AT

01:26:32.387 --> 01:26:34.756
ALL OF THE SAFETY NET PROGRAMS

01:26:34.822 --> 01:26:36.424
RIGHT IN THE FOR SPENDING MONEY

CURRENTLY ON SAFETY NET

01:26:37.959 --> 01:26:39.127
PROGRAMS THAT ARE EFFECTIVE OR

01:26:39.193 --> 01:26:40.762
DON'T WORK. FOR CALIFORNIANS

01:26:40.828 --> 01:26:42.096
THAT WE OUGHT TO TAKE THAT

01:26:42.163 --> 01:26:43.531
MONEY MAYBE WE ARE PUT INTO

01:26:43.598 --> 01:26:45.500
UNIVERSAL BASIC INCOME OR SOME

01:26:45.567 --> 01:26:48.002
OTHER- AVENUE WHICH WHICH WE

01:26:48.069 --> 01:26:50.171
CAN REALLY HELP PEOPLE. HAVE A

01:26:50.238 --> 01:26:52.206
MORE AFFORDABLE BETTER QUALITY

01:26:52.273 --> 01:26:53.708

THAT'S INSANE AND IT'S GOT TO

YEAH THIS IS A FAT FASTENING

01:28:21.562 --> 01:28:23.064
CONVERSATIONS SO I THINK THE

AUTHOR FOR AUTHORING THE BILL

01:28:25.299 --> 01:28:26.901

WHERE PEOPLE WORK- THAT HAVE

01:28:42.684 --> 01:28:43.951
DIED IN APPROPRIATIONS WHERE I

01:28:44.018 --> 01:28:47.288
EXPECT THIS BILL TO DIE- I

01:28:47.355 --> 01:28:48.122
DON'T KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO

01:28:48.189 --> 01:28:50.825

IS YOU KNOW I'M I'M LEARNING

01:29:10.912 --> 01:29:12.980
ABOUT IT. AND WE'RE SEEING

01:29:13.047 --> 01:29:14.482
DIFFERENT EXPERIMENTS WHICH I

01:29:14.549 --> 01:29:16.551
THINK IS A REALLY GOOD THING TO

01:29:16.617 --> 01:29:17.819
UNDERSTAND HOW IT IMPACTS

01:29:17.885 --> 01:29:21.122
COMMUNITIES AND SO- YOU KNOW I

01:29:21.189 --> 01:29:22.490
THINK IT'S VERY EARLY ON

01:29:22.557 --> 01:29:23.825
BECAUSE WE'RE JUST SEEN A YOU

01:29:23.891 --> 01:29:25.226
KNOW A GROWING OF THOSE

01:29:25.293 --> 01:29:27.228
EXPERIMENTS AROUND THE STATE SO

01:29:27.295 --> 01:29:29.097
YOU KNOW WE'VE SEEN ONE OR TWO

01:29:29.163 --> 01:29:30.098
BUT WE NEED TO SEE MANY MANY

01:29:30.164 --> 01:29:31.399
MORE. TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S

01:29:31.466 --> 01:29:33.134
RIGHT AS WELL AS WHAT'S RIGHT

01:29:33.201 --> 01:29:34.736
IN SPECIFIC COMMUNITIES AND

01:29:34.802 --> 01:29:37.105
WHAT WHAT HELPS PEOPLE. ON IN

01:29:37.171 --> 01:29:38.773
EACH COMMUNITY MY CONCERN ABOUT

01:29:38.840 --> 01:29:39.841
EIGHTEEN YEAR OLDS GOING WILD

01:29:39.907 --> 01:29:40.875

GET SOME HOUSING THAT'S WHAT

01:29:48.082 --> 01:29:50.284
PEOPLE WANT BASICALLY- IN

01:29:50.351 --> 01:29:53.688
MARIN. THEY'RE DOING ONE BASED

01:29:53.755 --> 01:29:56.290
ON LOW INCOME MOTHERS OF COLOR.

01:29:56.357 --> 01:29:59.260
AND I'M REALLY FASCINATED BY

01:29:59.327 --> 01:30:00.228
THIS THEY'RE GONNA CHOOSE A

01:30:00.294 --> 01:30:01.829
HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE. A LOT MORE

01:30:01.896 --> 01:30:04.766
QUALIFY AND THEIR BASE SEEN WHO

01:30:04.832 --> 01:30:06.434
CAN QUALIFY OFF OF WHAT'S

01:30:06.501 --> 01:30:07.802
CALLED THE SELF SUFFICIENCY

01:30:07.869 --> 01:30:09.370
STANDARD. DEVELOPED BY THE

01:30:09.437 --> 01:30:10.505
INSTITUTE CENTER FOR ECONOMIC

01:30:10.571 --> 01:30:12.273
DEVELOPMENT IN OAKLAND THE SELF

01:30:12.340 --> 01:30:13.441
SUFFICIENCY STANDARD FOR A

01:30:13.508 --> 01:30:14.408
FAMILY OF FOUR WITH TWO

01:30:14.475 --> 01:30:16.477
CHILDREN. IN MARIN IS A HUNDRED

01:30:16.544 --> 01:30:17.912
AND TWENTY NINE THOUSAND

01:30:17.979 --> 01:30:18.679
DOLLARS IT'S A VERY EXPENSIVE

01:30:18.746 --> 01:30:22.216
PLACE- SO WITH THIS EXPERIMENT

01:30:22.283 --> 01:30:25.820
THAT THEY'RE HAVING THAT THE-

01:30:25.887 --> 01:30:27.221
DATA SAID THAT THE PEOPLE WHO

01:30:27.288 --> 01:30:29.123
ARE GOING TO PARTICIPATE. YEAH

01:30:29.190 --> 01:30:30.458
THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO WANT TO

01:30:30.525 --> 01:30:31.492
GET SOME HEALTHY FOOD INTO

01:30:31.559 --> 01:30:33.294
THEIR CHILDREN'S YOU KNOW TIME

01:30:33.361 --> 01:30:35.496
IS. A SAFE PLACE FOR THEM TO

01:30:35.563 --> 01:30:38.699
LIVE- REALLY SOME BASIC THINGS

01:30:38.766 --> 01:30:40.234
HOPEFULLY THAT WILL ALSO CREATE

01:30:40.301 --> 01:30:42.170
A SAFETY NET FOR THEM BECAUSE

01:30:42.236 --> 01:30:43.037
WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF

01:30:43.104 --> 01:30:44.172
COSTS THAT COME OUT. FOR

01:30:44.238 --> 01:30:45.973
FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN. SO I'M

01:30:46.040 --> 01:30:47.475
I'M REALLY EXCITED TO SEE THESE

01:30:47.542 --> 01:30:49.877
DIFFERENT EXPERIMENTS POP UP

01:30:49.944 --> 01:30:51.679
ACROSS CALIFORNIA TO INFORM.

01:30:51.746 --> 01:30:53.247
BILLS LIKE YOURS I THINK SELECT

01:30:53.314 --> 01:30:54.982
COMMITTEE IS A GREAT WAY. TO

01:30:55.049 --> 01:30:56.884
FURTHER EXPLORE PROBABLY A

01:30:56.951 --> 01:30:58.920
LITTLE EARLY TO CREATE. A

01:30:58.986 --> 01:31:01.222
STATEWIDE ELIGIBILITY. BECAUSE

01:31:01.289 --> 01:31:03.524
I JUST DON'T KNOW. IF THAT'S IF

01:31:03.591 --> 01:31:04.926
THAT IS THE RIGHT APPROACH BUT

01:31:04.992 --> 01:31:06.260
AGAIN I DON'T THINK WERE FULLY

01:31:06.327 --> 01:31:07.395
INFORMED YET BUT LET'S MOVE

01:31:07.461 --> 01:31:08.863
THIS ALONG TO HAVE THAT

01:31:08.930 --> 01:31:12.400
CONVERSATION. RATHER THAN-

01:31:12.466 --> 01:31:13.901
CLOSE THE DOOR ON IT THANK YOU.

01:31:13.968 --> 01:31:16.537
HAPPY BIRTHDAY THANK YOU.

01:31:16.604 --> 01:31:20.641
ISRAEL THIS. THANK YOU- YOU

01:31:20.708 --> 01:31:22.677
KNOW I'VE STRUGGLED WITH THE

01:31:22.743 --> 01:31:25.012
CONCEPT OF A UNIVERSAL BASIC

01:31:25.079 --> 01:31:28.182
INCOME- I BELIEVE EVERYONE

01:31:28.249 --> 01:31:30.017
SHOULD HAVE A UNIVERSAL BASIC

01:31:30.084 --> 01:31:33.221
BUT I FEEL THAT- IT SHOULD BE

01:31:33.287 --> 01:31:35.823
THROUGH A GOOD JOB RATE AND WE

01:31:35.890 --> 01:31:37.725
WANT TO WORK YOU KNOW I

01:31:37.792 --> 01:31:38.559
REPRESENT A LOW INCOME

01:31:38.626 --> 01:31:41.128
DISTRICT- WHERE PEOPLE HAVE TO

01:31:41.195 --> 01:31:43.164
DRIVE HOURS TO GET TO WORK. TO

01:31:43.231 --> 01:31:47.568
GET A GOOD PAYING JOB- AND- AND

01:31:47.635 --> 01:31:50.905
BECAUSE OF THAT I KNOW THAT-

01:31:50.972 --> 01:31:52.506
PROGRAMS LIKE THIS COULD

01:31:52.573 --> 01:31:55.142
BENEFIT A LOT OF FAMILIES BUT-

01:31:55.209 --> 01:31:56.611
I STILL THINK THAT A GOOD JOB

01:31:56.677 --> 01:31:59.280
IS WHAT. WE NEED TO BE

01:31:59.347 --> 01:31:59.881
PROVIDING I KNOW THAT TAKES A

01:31:59.947 --> 01:32:03.951
LOT LONGER- AND- EVEN THOUGH AT

01:32:04.018 --> 01:32:05.686
I AM CONCERNED THAT THERE ISN'T

01:32:05.753 --> 01:32:07.889
A FUNDING SOURCE- AND SOME OF

01:32:07.955 --> 01:32:09.257
THE OTHER ISSUES THAT WERE

01:32:09.323 --> 01:32:11.492
BROUGHT UP IN THE ANALYSES- BUT

01:32:11.559 --> 01:32:13.527
I DO PLAN TO SUPPORT THE BILL.

TODAY TO KEEP THE CONVERSATION

01:32:16.063 --> 01:32:18.699

01:32:18.766 --> 01:32:21.435
ONE YEAR. BILL RIGHT THIS IS A

01:32:21.502 --> 01:32:23.504
POTENTIALLY MULTIPLE YEARS.

01:32:23.571 --> 01:32:25.907
ISSUE AND- YOU KNOW I COMMEND

01:32:25.973 --> 01:32:27.008

01:32:41.856 --> 01:32:42.924
THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS

01:32:42.990 --> 01:32:44.792
FORWARD IT'S SOMETHING THAT A

01:32:44.859 --> 01:32:46.193
LOT OF FOLKS DON'T UNDERSTAND.

01:32:46.260 --> 01:32:47.728
BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT THERE'S

01:32:47.795 --> 01:32:48.963
NOT REALLY A LOT OF DATA OUT

01:32:49.030 --> 01:32:51.399
THERE. THAT WE CAN TURN TO I

01:32:51.465 --> 01:32:53.134
THERE ARE SOME BAY AREA CITIES

01:32:53.200 --> 01:32:54.468
THAT HAVE STARTED VERY NEW

01:32:54.535 --> 01:32:56.771
PROGRAM STOCKTON I KNOW HAS THE

ONLY INCLUDES ONE YEAR'S WORTH

01:33:02.610 --> 01:33:05.746
OF DATA. SO JUST REAL QUICK I

01:33:05.813 --> 01:33:06.914
KNOW WE HAVE A OTHER BILLS TO

01:33:06.981 --> 01:33:08.883
HEAR- TO THE QUESTION A

01:33:08.950 --> 01:33:10.384
QUESTION OF THE AUTHORS HOW

01:33:10.451 --> 01:33:12.153
IMPORTANT. IS IT TO THE

01:33:12.219 --> 01:33:15.623
CONVERSATION THAT THIS BILL

01:33:15.690 --> 01:33:16.123
LEASES. GETS OUT OF THIS

01:33:16.190 --> 01:33:17.792
COMMITTEE. YES THANK YOU VERY

01:33:17.858 --> 01:33:19.593
MUCH AND HAVE A GRAYSON.

ABSOLUTELY I I'M NOT TRYING TO.

01:33:22.029 --> 01:33:24.565
MAKE ANY TYPE OF. A STATEMENT

01:33:24.632 --> 01:33:27.068
THAT THIS IS FULLY COOKED. IN

01:33:27.134 --> 01:33:28.336
FACT I SAID IN MY OPENING

01:33:28.402 --> 01:33:30.871
COMMENTS THAT. THE PRICE TAG

01:33:30.938 --> 01:33:33.007
WHICH STREET BECAUSE IT WAS.

01:33:33.074 --> 01:33:34.608
THIS IS NOT A FEASIBLE SOLUTION

01:33:34.675 --> 01:33:35.943
BUT LOOK AT WHAT WE'RE DOING

01:33:36.010 --> 01:33:37.178
RIGHT NOW. WE'RE HAVING

01:33:37.244 --> 01:33:39.513
DIALOGUE ABOUT THE POLICY OF

01:33:39.580 --> 01:33:41.449
BASIC INCOME. AND BY THE WAY

01:33:41.515 --> 01:33:42.984
WE'RE SEEING MANY ITERATIONS OF

01:33:43.050 --> 01:33:45.086
THIS IN OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES.

01:33:45.152 --> 01:33:47.221
AND WHY BECAUSE INDIVIDUALS ARE

01:33:47.288 --> 01:33:48.990
HURTING EVERY DAY CALIFORNIANS

01:33:49.056 --> 01:33:50.891
ARE HURTING IS THIS GOING TO BE

01:33:50.958 --> 01:33:52.059

01:33:55.997 --> 01:33:58.199
HAVING A DIALOGUE AND TO ALLOW

01:33:58.265 --> 01:34:00.301
FOR THE PUBLIC PROCESS. TO ALSO

01:34:00.368 --> 01:34:02.036
CURSED SUCHTHAT MEMBERS OF THE

01:34:02.103 --> 01:34:03.804
PUBLIC CAN ALSO SEE AND HEAR

01:34:03.871 --> 01:34:05.406
ABOUT THE POLICY CONVERSATION.

01:34:05.473 --> 01:34:07.108
THAT WE CANNOT JUST GO OUT AND

01:34:07.174 --> 01:34:08.676
MAKE THE STATEMENTS THAT YES

01:34:08.743 --> 01:34:10.011
THIS IS ABSOLUTELY GOING TO

01:34:10.077 --> 01:34:11.278
SOLVE ONE PROBLEM. AND WILL

01:34:11.345 --> 01:34:12.947
HAPPEN OVERNIGHT RATHER LOOK

DELIBERATE OF BODY AND HAVING

01:34:15.783 --> 01:34:17.251
QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS ABOUT.

01:34:17.318 --> 01:34:19.553
HOW THIS CAN ACTUALLY BE DONE

01:34:19.620 --> 01:34:20.521
HOW THE IMPLEMENTATION WITH

01:34:20.588 --> 01:34:21.689
IMPLICATION LOOK AT ONE OF THE

01:34:21.756 --> 01:34:23.057
DISTINCTIONS BEHALF WHICH FIND

01:34:23.124 --> 01:34:25.493
IT. AND HOW DOES THIS ADD UP

01:34:25.559 --> 01:34:27.094
GOING TO AFFECT IN COMPARISON

01:34:27.161 --> 01:34:28.496
TO SOME OTHER EXISTING PROGRAMS

01:34:28.562 --> 01:34:29.330
HAVE TO STRING SOME OTHER

01:34:29.397 --> 01:34:30.398
PROGRAMS OR NOT. AND THAT'S

01:34:30.464 --> 01:34:32.299
WHAT I WELCOME THE DIALOGUE

01:34:32.366 --> 01:34:33.801

THIS MOVE FORWARD AND THAT IS

01:34:34.702 --> 01:34:37.038
MY REQUEST. TO BE EQUALLY

01:34:37.104 --> 01:34:38.305
COMMITTED TO AS AN AUTHOR TO

01:34:38.372 --> 01:34:39.740
SAY THAT SHOULD THIS LEAVE THE

01:34:39.807 --> 01:34:40.708
COMMUNITY I'M ABSOLUTELY

01:34:40.775 --> 01:34:45.179

PILOTS PROGRAMS GOING ON AND I

01:34:57.758 --> 01:34:58.959
THINK ALL WITH A LITTLE

01:34:59.026 --> 01:35:00.294
DIFFERENTLY ONCE IN THIS

01:35:00.361 --> 01:35:02.096
CLEARLY IS NOT A ONE YOUR BILL

THERE'S A HUGE CONVERSATION IN

01:35:03.597 --> 01:35:04.799
THE AUTHOR IS VERY WELL AWARE

01:56:57.243 --> 01:56:59.345
LITTLE BETTER KIND OF WHAT YOUR

01:56:59.412 --> 01:57:03.049
GOALS ARE AND THE- THE BREATH

01:57:03.116 --> 01:57:05.885
OF THE POLICY HERE RIGHT I

01:57:05.952 --> 01:57:06.519
UNDERSTAND WE'RE LOOKING AT TAX

01:57:06.586 --> 01:57:09.021
EXPENDITURES- THINGS LIKE I

01:57:09.088 --> 01:57:10.723
ASSUME THE HOLLYWOOD TAX CREDIT

01:57:10.790 --> 01:57:13.159
THE TRACTOR TO ACTUALLY NOT THE

01:57:13.226 --> 01:57:15.228
HOLLYWOOD TAX CREDIT ANYTHING

01:57:15.294 --> 01:57:17.430
THAT HAS TO SUNSET ON IT. WE'RE

01:57:17.497 --> 01:57:19.399
NOT LOOKING AT IT WE'RE SIMPLY

01:57:19.465 --> 01:57:20.933
LOOKING AT THE ONES THAT WERE

01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:25.104
DONE PRIOR TO ASKING FOR SUNSET

01:57:25.171 --> 01:57:28.341
THAT ARE THEIR PERPETUALLY AND-

01:57:28.408 --> 01:57:31.611
I LOOK AT THIS BILL SHOULD

01:57:31.677 --> 01:57:32.845
SOMEONE COME UP. WITH A

01:57:32.912 --> 01:57:35.982
PROPOSAL TO CUT ANY OF THOSE-

01:57:36.048 --> 01:57:36.916
THAT THEY WERE I HOPE THEY

01:57:36.983 --> 01:57:40.753
WOULD WAIT. UNTIL WE GET THIS

01:57:40.820 --> 01:57:44.123
FULL REPORT ON THE- CORPORATE

01:57:44.190 --> 01:57:45.725
TAX BREAKS TO DO NOT HAVE

01:57:45.792 --> 01:57:46.592
SUNSETS BUT THAT'S WHAT WE'RE

01:57:46.659 --> 01:57:48.928
LOOKING AT IT THAT WAS TEN

01:57:48.995 --> 01:57:50.496
PROGRAMS BECAUSE WE'RE TAKING

01:57:50.563 --> 01:57:52.198
THAT AS CORPORATION.

01:57:52.265 --> 01:57:54.000
CONSIDERATION IS PROBABLY NINE

01:57:54.066 --> 01:57:57.437
NOW. AND ARE WE LOOKING ALSO

01:57:57.503 --> 01:58:00.273
AT- X. POLICY MORE GENERALLY

01:58:00.339 --> 01:58:03.376
LIKE- NO IT STARTED AT LEVI'S

01:58:03.443 --> 01:58:06.245
DI&lt;c.cyan&gt; AND ESSENTIALLY THE-&lt;/c&gt;

01:58:06.312 --> 01:58:07.980
WHAT THEY'LL SAY IS HERE'S WHAT

01:58:08.047 --> 01:58:10.716
ACROSS THE STATE. THESE ARE THE

01:58:10.783 --> 01:58:13.753
BENEFITS- LEGISLATURE YOU

01:58:13.820 --> 01:58:15.555
DECIDE WHAT YOU WANT TO DO NEXT

01:58:15.621 --> 01:58:17.590
THAT'S REALLY WHAT IT'S GOING

01:58:17.657 --> 01:58:19.392
TO COME UP WITH. SO IF I WERE

01:58:19.459 --> 01:58:20.393
TO SAY TO YOU THAT THAT THAT

01:58:20.460 --> 01:58:21.894
THAT STRIKES ME AS IT'S MAYBE

01:58:21.961 --> 01:58:23.930
DUPLICATIVE OF THE WORK WE DO

01:58:23.996 --> 01:58:26.466
HERE. IN THIS COMMITTEE NO

01:58:26.532 --> 01:58:28.301
BECAUSE OUR CHARGE WE ARE

01:58:28.367 --> 01:58:31.571
YOU'RE NOT LOOKED. AT IN DETAIL

01:58:31.637 --> 01:58:33.339
ABOUT WHAT THE BENEFITS ARE OF

01:58:33.406 --> 01:58:34.907
THESE PROGRAMS WE CLEARLY HAVE

01:58:34.974 --> 01:58:37.677
THE NUMBERS ON WHAT THE COST IS

01:58:37.743 --> 01:58:39.512
WHAT THE STATE SPENDING ON THEM

01:58:39.579 --> 01:58:41.147
WELL WE DON'T KNOW IS WHAT THE

01:58:41.214 --> 01:58:44.083
BENEFITS ARE. AND THAT'S VERY

01:58:44.150 --> 01:58:46.052
IMPORTANT. AND WE DON'T KNOW

01:58:46.118 --> 01:58:47.987
THAT BECAUSE- WE HAVE A WE

01:58:48.054 --> 01:58:49.722
DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THE

01:58:49.789 --> 01:58:51.691
UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA AND THE-

01:58:51.757 --> 01:58:53.226
WELL FOLKS THAT WE WORK THERE

01:58:53.292 --> 01:58:54.927
AND RIGHT WE'RE LOOKING AT THIS

01:58:54.994 --> 01:58:56.462
IS GOING TO TAKE TIME AND

01:58:56.529 --> 01:58:58.431
ENERGY AND- I DON'T THINK THAT

01:58:58.498 --> 01:59:00.266
THE STAFF HERE HAS THE BAND

01:59:00.333 --> 01:59:03.035
WITH TO DO IT. WE DID TALK TO

01:59:03.102 --> 01:59:04.103
THE L. A. O. ONE TIME ABOUT

01:59:04.170 --> 01:59:05.137
HAVING THEM DO IT THEY DIDN'T

01:59:05.204 --> 01:59:07.340
HAVE THE CAPACITY FOR IT- BUT

01:59:07.406 --> 01:59:08.975
THE REASON WE TAKEN OUT. THOSE

01:59:09.041 --> 01:59:10.576
WITH THE CENTS A DAY AND THOSE

01:59:10.643 --> 01:59:12.812
WITH METRICS IS BECAUSE- THERE

01:59:12.879 --> 01:59:14.480
WAS A BILL AT. EVENTUALLY THAT

01:59:14.547 --> 01:59:15.948
SAID THAT ALL POLICY THAT CAME

01:59:16.015 --> 01:59:17.550
THROUGH- ALL EXPENDITURES THAT

01:59:17.617 --> 01:59:18.951
CAME THERE HAD TO HAVE EIGHT.

01:59:19.018 --> 01:59:20.186
HAVE TO HAVE METRICS INCLUDED

01:59:20.253 --> 01:59:21.120
IN THERE OR THEY COULD BE

01:59:21.187 --> 01:59:22.054
PASSED OUT OF COMMITTEE WHICH A

01:59:22.121 --> 01:59:23.356
LOT OF PEOPLE COMPLAIN ABOUT

01:59:23.422 --> 01:59:24.457
ACTUALLY WHEN THEY COME TO

01:59:24.524 --> 01:59:26.292
COMMITTEE. SO ANYTHING THAT'S

01:59:26.359 --> 01:59:27.593
PASSED THAT HAS ALL THOSE

01:59:27.660 --> 01:59:29.395
METRICS RIGHT. WE ARE WE

01:59:29.462 --> 01:59:30.863
REQUIRE THAT THOSE METRICS BE

01:59:30.930 --> 01:59:33.299
PART OF THE BILL. AS IT PASSES.

01:59:33.366 --> 01:59:34.233
THESE ARE SOME BILLS THAT

01:59:34.300 --> 01:59:36.002
WARRANT DID NOT HAVE SENT THAT

01:59:36.068 --> 01:59:37.803
DAY OR METRIC REQUIREMENTS. AND

01:59:37.870 --> 01:59:41.173
SO THESE ARE BUT A LAYERS. AND

01:59:41.240 --> 01:59:42.575
MEASURE ALL ALONG THAT LINE OF

01:59:42.642 --> 01:59:43.543
THINKING THAT WHY DON'T WE JUST

01:59:43.609 --> 01:59:45.278
INSERT SUNSET DATE SUNDAY.

01:59:45.344 --> 01:59:46.946
EVERY TAX POLICY WE DO NOT

01:59:47.013 --> 01:59:48.047
ACTUALLY AT THAT WE DON'T KNOW

01:59:48.114 --> 01:59:49.148
THE PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE IT

01:59:49.215 --> 01:59:50.416
WE- WE HAVE THE- GUYS TO DO

01:59:50.483 --> 01:59:53.586
THAT TODAY WITH THIS COMMITTEE.

01:59:53.653 --> 01:59:54.754
YEAH WE DON'T. IF THAT'S I WANT

01:59:54.820 --> 01:59:55.655
TO BRING UP EACH ONE OF THOSE

01:59:55.721 --> 01:59:58.024
BILLS BUT SO. BUT IN ATHENS

01:59:58.090 --> 01:59:58.958
THIS WAS A WAY OF ACTUALLY

01:59:59.025 --> 02:00:00.860
GETTING A STUDY TO EVALUATE ALL

02:00:00.927 --> 02:00:01.761
OF THOSE THAT ALL OF THE

02:00:01.827 --> 02:00:04.397
ACTUAL. HOW IF THESE CUT BUT

02:00:04.463 --> 02:00:06.532
THE EFFICACY OF ART OF THE TAX

02:00:06.599 --> 02:00:08.401
CREDITS. BECAUSE WE DID NOT

02:00:08.467 --> 02:00:11.103
REQUIRE IT BEFORE. SO IT JUST

02:00:11.170 --> 02:00:11.938
IT GIVES ME PAUSE I MEAN THAT'S

02:00:12.004 --> 02:00:13.873
NOT THE WAY TO SKIN A CAT. I

02:00:13.940 --> 02:00:14.941
THINK IT IT LEADS US IN THE

02:00:15.007 --> 02:00:16.576
DIRECTION WELL. HEY IT'S

02:00:16.642 --> 02:00:18.911
SUGGESTS TO OUR CONSTITUENCIES

02:00:18.978 --> 02:00:20.580
AND EVEN WITHIN. OUR OWN

02:00:20.646 --> 02:00:22.214
INSTITUTION HERE- WHICH WORKED

02:00:22.281 --> 02:00:26.018
AT. THAT THERE'S A RIGHT ANSWER

02:00:26.085 --> 02:00:26.986
RIGHT RATHER THAN. I WOULD MAKE

02:00:27.053 --> 02:00:28.454
AN ARGUMENT THAT I ATTACHED

02:00:28.521 --> 02:00:29.355
POLICIES REALLY MATTER TRADE

02:00:29.422 --> 02:00:32.091
OFFS RIGHT- WHAT. ONE

02:00:32.158 --> 02:00:33.726
SUBCENTRAL CALIFORNIA'S MATE

02:00:33.793 --> 02:00:35.194
MAY DO WELL UNDER SOMETHING

02:00:35.261 --> 02:00:36.128
WHILE ANOTHER SUFFERS OR VICE

02:00:36.195 --> 02:00:39.265
VERSA- AND IT JUST GIVES ME A

02:00:39.332 --> 02:00:41.367
LITTLE BIT OF RESERVATION. THAT

02:00:41.434 --> 02:00:43.302
WE TRY TO OUT SOURCE OUR WORK

02:00:43.369 --> 02:00:46.138
HERE THE EGISLATURE- IT IN IN

02:00:46.205 --> 02:00:48.641
THE PURSUIT OF. AND BY NO MEANS

02:00:48.708 --> 02:00:50.009
LIMIT LET MEGO AHEAD SAY I

02:00:50.076 --> 02:00:51.344
AGREE WITH YOU. MORE

02:00:51.410 --> 02:00:53.079
INFORMATION IS BETTER THAT THE

02:00:53.145 --> 02:00:54.847
THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO ARGUMENT

02:00:54.914 --> 02:00:56.349
THAT WE SHOULDN'T. AVAIL

02:00:56.415 --> 02:00:57.950
OURSELVES OF THOSE RESOURCES I

02:00:58.017 --> 02:01:00.886
JUST DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND WHY

02:01:00.953 --> 02:01:01.554
WE NEED A BILL TO DO SO I GUESS.

02:01:01.621 --> 02:01:03.255
WELL WE DO BECAUSE WE DON'T

02:01:03.322 --> 02:01:05.091
HAVE THE BANDWIDTH AND FRANKLY.

02:01:05.157 --> 02:01:07.159
THIS WOULD BE AN INDEPENDENT.

02:01:07.226 --> 02:01:10.262
VALUATION YOU DON'T WANT THE

02:01:10.329 --> 02:01:11.764
LEGISLATURE WHICH MIGHT NEED

02:01:11.831 --> 02:01:15.668
TAXES MAKING THIS EVALUATION.

02:01:15.735 --> 02:01:17.069
IN FAIRNESS WE DO HAVE LOTS OF

02:01:17.136 --> 02:01:18.604
ELSE OFFICE THE WE HAVE THE

02:01:18.671 --> 02:01:20.106
STATE AUDITOR DAVE GRAHAM THEY

02:01:20.172 --> 02:01:22.208
DON'T HAVE THE CAPACITY WE ASK

02:01:22.274 --> 02:01:25.244
THEM LAST YEAR. WILL WE CAN

02:01:25.311 --> 02:01:26.512
INCREASE THEIR BUDGET INCREASE

02:01:26.579 --> 02:01:27.613
THE CAPACITY I'M JUST TELLING

02:01:27.680 --> 02:01:29.749
YOU WE DID GO TO THEM AND THEY

02:01:29.815 --> 02:01:31.050
DID NOT THE CAPACITY AND THE

02:01:31.117 --> 02:01:32.985
BUDGET FOR THEM TO DO IT WAS

02:01:33.052 --> 02:01:34.587
LARGER THAN THIS WAS ACTUALLY

02:01:34.654 --> 02:01:36.622
THE THIS WAS AN EFFICIENT WAY

02:01:36.689 --> 02:01:38.524
TO COLLECT THAT INFORMATION.

02:01:38.591 --> 02:01:42.595
AND BE. OSZYCE WHAT ARE DOLLARS.

02:01:42.662 --> 02:01:44.430
I AM STILL HAVE AN OBJECTIVE

02:01:44.497 --> 02:01:47.033
OPINION ANALYSIS. FOR THOSE

02:01:47.099 --> 02:01:48.634
THINGS THAT ARE NOT BEING WE'RE

02:01:48.701 --> 02:01:49.535
NOT REQUIRED TO HAVE AN

02:01:49.602 --> 02:01:51.337
ANALYSIS ORIGINALLY IS NOT AND

02:01:51.404 --> 02:01:52.371
IF WE WERE TO ASK ONE OF THOSE

02:01:52.438 --> 02:01:53.606
GROUPS TO DO IT SINCE THEY

02:01:53.673 --> 02:01:55.541
DON'T HAVE THE EXPERTISE THEY

02:01:55.608 --> 02:01:56.942
WOULD HAVE TO FARM IT OUT AS

02:01:57.009 --> 02:01:58.711
WELL YOU DON'T WANT TO HIRE A

02:01:58.778 --> 02:01:59.979
BUNCH TAX EXPERTS THAT YOU'RE

02:02:00.046 --> 02:02:02.281
GOING TO USE ONCE. SO EITHER

02:02:02.348 --> 02:02:04.684
WAY YOU'RE LIKELY TO THIS WAY

02:02:04.750 --> 02:02:05.985
IT'S TRANSPARENT WE KNOW WHO'S

02:02:06.052 --> 02:02:08.587
GOING TO DO IT IT'S A

02:02:08.654 --> 02:02:11.023
PARTICULAR BRANCH IF YOU SEE. I

CONSIDERATION FOR THIS POLICY

TO OPEN IT UP TO. A BROADER

02:02:19.065 --> 02:02:22.668
ARRAY OF TAX POLICY INCLUDING-

02:02:22.735 --> 02:02:24.103
YOU KNOW HOW WE EVALUATE OUR

02:02:24.170 --> 02:02:25.237
TAX SYSTEM YOU MIGHT BE

02:02:25.304 --> 02:02:26.572
INTERESTED TO SEE YOU KNOW

02:02:26.639 --> 02:02:29.308
WHAT- WHY NOT RELAYING THE

02:02:29.375 --> 02:02:30.443
TAXES IF THOSE ARE THE MOST

02:02:30.509 --> 02:02:33.379
EFFECTIVE. PLACES TO YEAH WE

02:02:33.446 --> 02:02:34.480
CAN LOOK AT A NEW BILL NEXT

02:02:34.547 --> 02:02:37.016
YEAR I'M RIGHT NOW WITH

02:02:37.083 --> 02:02:40.252
LIMITED-HEARINGS I'M GOING TO

02:02:40.319 --> 02:02:41.153
KEEP THIS BILL IS NARROW AS IT

02:02:41.220 --> 02:02:43.389
IS. BUT WE CAN TALK ABOUT THE

02:02:43.456 --> 02:02:44.990
FOR NEXT YEAR IT KEEP ME POSTED

APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING THIS

02:02:52.398 --> 02:02:53.365
BEFORE AND I THINK IT'S

02:02:53.432 --> 02:02:54.700
INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT FOR US TO

02:02:54.767 --> 02:02:55.968
HAVE SOME SENSE OF THE COST

02:02:56.035 --> 02:02:58.437
BENEFIT ANALYSIS- YOU KNOW FOR.

02:02:58.504 --> 02:03:00.139
PROGRAMS WHEN WE ACTUALLY DON'T

02:03:00.206 --> 02:03:01.507
RIGHT NOW AND- I'M A BELIEVER

02:03:01.574 --> 02:03:02.842
THAT. SOME OF THESE TAX

02:03:02.908 --> 02:03:04.243
EXPENDITURES WERE GONNA LOOK AT

02:03:04.310 --> 02:03:05.144
AND SAY OH MY GOD THAT IS A

02:03:05.211 --> 02:03:07.246
GREAT. USE OF CALIFORNIA FUNDS

02:03:07.313 --> 02:03:08.781
LET'S DOUBLE DOWN ON THAT AND

02:03:08.848 --> 02:03:09.882
MAYBE SOME OTHERS WE REALIZE

02:03:09.949 --> 02:03:11.183
THAT. NOT GET OUR MONEY BACK

02:03:11.250 --> 02:03:13.786
FOR THAT. CAN I JUST I'M ASK A

02:03:13.853 --> 02:03:16.288
QUESTION THE- SOME OF THE

02:03:16.355 --> 02:03:17.923
OPPOSITION AND MADE THE POINT

02:03:17.990 --> 02:03:19.391
THAT THEY WERE SUBJECTIVE

02:03:19.458 --> 02:03:20.960
EVALUATION METRICS WHICH-

02:03:21.026 --> 02:03:22.261
FRANKLY KNOWING YOU FIND SO

02:03:22.328 --> 02:03:23.863
MUCH HARD TO BELIEVE CAN YOU

02:03:23.929 --> 02:03:24.897
JUST GIVE US KIND OF THE ONE

02:03:24.964 --> 02:03:27.533
MINUTE. VERSION OF HOW THAT

02:03:27.600 --> 02:03:29.401
COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS. THE

02:03:29.468 --> 02:03:33.472
BENEFIT SIDE. IT'S SIDE IS

02:03:33.539 --> 02:03:35.841
GOING TO BE BY ITS NATURE.

02:03:35.908 --> 02:03:39.044
DIFFICULT IF IT WERE EASY WE

02:03:39.111 --> 02:03:41.781
COULD ASK THE AUDITOR TO DO IT-

02:03:41.847 --> 02:03:44.250
SO FOR EXAMPLE YOU WOULD SAY.

02:03:44.316 --> 02:03:46.318
WE HAVE A PRTICULAR TAX BREAK

02:03:46.385 --> 02:03:48.120
THIS IS WHAT IT COSTS THAT'S

02:03:48.187 --> 02:03:50.322
THE PART WE NOW. THE QUESTION

02:03:50.389 --> 02:03:52.892
WILL BE A FOR EXAMPLE IS

02:03:52.958 --> 02:03:54.827
COMPARABLE TO OTHER STATES IF

02:03:54.894 --> 02:03:57.730
IT'S LOWER. WE'LL FIND THAT N

02:03:57.797 --> 02:03:59.799
AND WE MIGHT THEN WORRIED THAT

02:03:59.865 --> 02:04:01.000
WE'RE GOING TO LOSE USINESS

02:04:01.066 --> 02:04:02.635
BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE A SIDE

02:04:02.701 --> 02:04:05.237
TAX BREAK IF IT'S MUCH HIGHER

02:04:05.304 --> 02:04:07.606
COMPARED TO OTHER STATES. THEN

02:04:07.673 --> 02:04:10.309
WE SHOULD. TAKE A LOOK FOR

02:04:10.376 --> 02:04:12.378
EXAMPLE AT THE CORPORATIONS

02:04:12.444 --> 02:04:15.080
THAT WOULD- BENEFIT FROM THIS

02:04:15.147 --> 02:04:16.982
TAX BREAK TO THEY LOCATE IN OUR

02:04:17.049 --> 02:04:18.450
STATE OR DO THEY GO SOMEWHERE

02:04:18.517 --> 02:04:21.620
ELSE. THAT'S WHAT WE WILL TRY

02:04:21.687 --> 02:04:23.155
THAT'S WHAT WILL BE DONE TO

02:04:23.222 --> 02:04:26.659
THAT EXTENT- AGAIN THE

02:04:26.725 --> 02:04:27.893

02:04:34.633 --> 02:04:36.468
OR NOT WE WANT TO PURSUE THOSE

02:04:36.535 --> 02:04:38.504
THERE WILL BE NO RECOMMENDATION

02:04:38.571 --> 02:04:39.805
THEY'LL SIMPLY PRESENT THE

02:04:39.872 --> 02:04:41.740

02:04:41.807 --> 02:04:44.476
