THOSE ARE ON THE THREE BILLS THAT WILL BE PRESENTED ON TODAY THANK YOU AND HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS I'M- TRYING BY MY COLLEAGUES AT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THANK YOU. THIS JUDY OF ANY COMMENTS HELLO. A GOOD MORNING CAROLINE SHE FROM THE L. A. OTIS HERE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS- THAT YOU ALL MAY HAVE. OKAY THANK YOU LET'S GO TO. MY COLLEAGUES THE QUESTIONS FROM THE- WITH. FOR I'M IF I CAN ASK THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ON- ON AB EIGHTY FOUR SB NINETY FIVE CERTAINLY- THERE IS THE- CLAIM THAT ANY FEDERAL TAX CREDITS- WOULD BE ALLOWED TO BE USED TO OFFSET THE COST HERE BUT THE ONE I LIKE TO GET YOUR RESPONSE IN TERMS OF- A SMALL BUSINESSES WHO MAY ACCESS THE FEDERAL TAX CREDITS TO OFFSET SOME OF THESE BECAUSE THEY WON'T HAVE THE IMMEDIATE CAPITAL. TWO US BAND IN THE PAYROLL COSTS- WITH THIS MANDATE AND THE FACT THAT IT'S ALSO RETROACTIVE ALSO CREATES ANOTHER IMAGE- ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN. COULD YOU ELABORATE ON TERMS OF HAL- HOW HOW WE SHOULD RECONCILE THAT. SURE MISTER BOND LET ME FIRST SAY THAT THIS IS NOT- ANYTHING NEW BUT THIS IS A CONTINUATION OF- OF WHAT WAS PROVIDED IN THE EXECUTIVE ORDER- MENTIONED EARLIER AS WELL AS IN- EIGHTY EIGHTEEN SIXTY SEVEN AND SO THIS IS A CONTINUATION OF THE EXPECTATIONS AND BUSINESSES- ALONG WITH- JUST AGAIN POINT OUT THE FEDERAL CREDIT WHICH IS QUITE GENEROUS IT PROVIDES A- DOLLAR FOR DOLLAR COMPENSATION. IN TERMS OF A TAX CREDIT- AND- UNDERSTAND A QUESTION IS THE UP FRONT COST AND I THINK THAT THAT NEEDS TO BE BALANCED WITH THE INTENT OF THE BILL WHICH IS REALLY TO STOP THE SPREAD OF KOBE IN THE WORKPLACE. AND TO ENCOURAGE THOSE TO TAKE- TIME OFF TO RECEIVE VACCINATIONS. SO IS IT THE POSITION OF THE MINISTRATION THAT A SMALL BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE THIS IS THIS IS AN IT IN ADDITION TO. WITH A FEDERAL- LEAVE AND ADDED IN ADDITION TO EVERY OTHER ADDITIONAL LEAVES THAT WERE FROM THAT WERE MANDATED. SELL YOU SAYING THAT A SMALL BUSINESS CAN CAN CLAIM THE FEDERAL TAX CREDIT FOR ALL THESE LEAVES NOW. I'M YEAH LET ME LET ME CLARIFY AND ALSO STATE THERE IS AN EXEMPTION IN THIS BILL OF FOR EMPLOYERS WHO HAVE TWENTY FIVE OR LESS EMPLOYEES AND JUST WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE FACT THAT- THERE IS WELL THERE'S A KNOWLEDGE MEANT THAT THIS IS A BIRD AND A FINANCIAL BURDEN ON SOME SMALL BUSINESSES SO I JUST WANT TO POINT THAT OUT AND I APOLOGIZE I DID NOT THINK THAT OUT OF MY EARLIER RESPONSE- BUT THAT IS RECOGNITION- OF SMALL BUSINESS IMPACT SMALL BUSINESS- AND IN REGARDS TO THE FEDERAL CREDIT THE FEDERAL CREDIT IS. IS PROVIDED PURSUANT TO- BOTH THE- THE FAMILY FIRST I RUN A VIRUS ACT AS WELL AS SUBSEQUENT FINANCIAL FIT FEDERAL STIMULUS- ACTS THAT PROVIDE CREDIT SO WHATEVER- BELIEVE IS PROVIDED PURSUANT TO THOSE BILLS- ARE THOSE ACTS WOULD RECEIVE THE FEDERAL CREDIT AND THIS THE CURRENT CREDIT- IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE EXTENSION OF THE FIGURE OUT OF THE FAMILY FIRST AFTER THAT WAS PROVIDED- BY THE. FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ON LAST YEAR. SO I GUESS MAYBE AT MOMENT LET ME A THIS AND I GUESS AND A DIFFERENT WAY MAYBE THAT WILL CLARIFY FOR ME. CAN A SMALL BUSINESS OR KIND OF BUSINESS THAT SAY THAT'S NOT EXEMPTED. CANVEY OFFSET. THE COST DOLLAR FOR DOLLAR. OF THIS NEW MANDATE WITH THE FEDERAL TAX CREDIT. WELL WILL THERE BE ADDITIONAL COSTS TO AN EMPLOYER THAT HAS TWENTY SIX EMPLOYEES. CHARS SO FOR EVERY EMPLOYER WHO PROVIDES A SICK LEAVE- ABOVE AGAINST ABOUT THAT TWENTY SIX TWENTY SIX EMPLOYEES THEY WILL RECEIVE A FEDERAL CREDIT- THAT A DOLLAR FOR DOLLAR WORTH THE COMPENSATION THAT WAS PROVIDED TO THE EMPLOYEE. BUT AS A COVER THAT I GUESS THE QUESTION IS DOES IT COVERED THIS ADDITIONAL MANDATE. YES SERVICE YES IT DOES OKAY FEDERAL CREDIT WOULD BE PROVIDED PURSUANT TO THIS BILL BECAUSE THIS BILL IS ALIGNED TO THE FEDERAL. OKAY AND THEN CAN CAN YOU JUST- I GUESS ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF PAGA AND WIDE THAT WAS INCLUDED IN THIS BILL. WITH THE NECESSARY. THEY HAVE A TO ADD LOCATION TO THIS. BILL SURE AND LET ME TURN THAT QUESTION OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE DANIEL BRANDON WHO MAY HAVE SOME MORE DETAILS ON PAGA. EIGHT YES DANIEL BRANDON WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND WE DON'T THAT THE LABOR CODE SECTION WOULD ALLOW IN PLACE FLEXIBLE PENALTIES. AND HOWEVER. VIGIL WOULD NEED TO ASK FOR THAT LEAD BEFORE ANY OF THE PENALTIES- APPLIED WE THINK THIS IS IMPORTANT TO BE ABLE TO PROTECT THE HEALTH OF THE WORKERS TO ENSURE THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO TAKE THIS TIME OFF. I THINK I'D A MESSAGE I THINK MY AND MY CONCERN IS QUITE INTELLIGENCE LOCALS CONTINUES TO HOLD THE BUDGET COMMITTEE CALL. IS THAT- THAT WE KNOW OUR SMALL BUSINESSES IN OUR COMMUNITY ARE STRUGGLING AND THIS IS AN ADDITIONAL MANDATE I DON'T BELIEVE- WILL BE COPIED THE WILL BE OVER OFFSET BY THE FEDERAL TAX CREDITS BECAUSE OF THE TIMING OF EVERYTHING AND THE UP FRONT COSTS AND LITIGATION ADDED TO AT THIS TIME IS- I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW WE JUST ADD MORE COSTLY LITIGATION. ON TO SMALL BUSINESSES TRYING TO SURVIVE. FIGURE MUCHAS CHAIR. THANK YOU. COOPER THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR IS THE FOLLOW UP ON- MY COLLEAGUES QUESTION SO WHAT ABOUT FOR EMPLOYER DID PROVIDE LEAVING JANUARY COULD BE EMPLOYER BE SUBJECT TO A LAWSUIT ON THE PART OF OUR CIVIL FOR CIVIL PENALTIES. LET ME JUST. MAKE ONE POINT AND I THINK I'LL TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE AS WELL- SO IF AN EMPLOYER PROVIDED PAID SICK OR SICK LEAVE. TO AN EMPLOYEE IN JANUARY OR BEYOND JANUARY UP UNTIL THEY'VE ACTIVATED THE SPELL IT WOULD GET CREDIT BASICALLY FOR THOSE HOURS. AND RECEIVED A CREDIT FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SO THOSE THOSE HOURS WOULD COUNT TOWARDS THAT THE PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL- I'M NOT SURE THAT SPECIFICALLY ANSWER YOUR QUESTION BUT I JUST WANT TO- UNDER SCHIANO UNDERSCORE THE FACT THAT THIS IS. A BILL THAT'S RETROACTIVE TO JANUARY ONE OF THIS YEAR. OKAY THANK YOU- WELL I APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S INTENT TO ENSURE THERE IS A GAP BETWEEN THE EXPIRATION. OF AB EIGHTEEN SIXTY SEVEN AT THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY. AND THE REINSTATEMENT OF CALIFORNIA'S PAID SICK LEAVE FOR ONE JERRY FIRST. I CONCERNED ABOUT THE RETROACTIVE CHANGE THE WALL SO. MANY THE SMALL BUSINESSES IN MY DISTRICT ARE CONCERNED ABOUT POTETIAL EMPLOYER LIABILITY. THIS ISSUE BEEN ADDRESSED IN THE BILL SO THAT THE BUSINESSES ARE NOT HELD RETRACT WITH VIABLE FOR PENALTIES FOR EXAMPLE. THEY DID NOT COMPETENT EMPLOYEE FOR PAID SICK LEAVE. DURING THE PAST TWO ONE HALF MONTHS. WHEN EMPLOYERS NOT HAVE A LEGAL OBLIGATION TO DO SO. THANK YOU MISTER COOPER DANIEL BRANDON WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. BELIEVE PROVIDED AND- IF. SO IF THE LEAVE PROVIDED BY THE EMPLOYER BETWEEN JACK. TIME THE BILL IS SIGNED IS THAT IS ELIGIBLE UNDER THIS PROGRAM THEN THE EMPLOYER WOULD GET CREDIT THE EMPLOYER WOULD ALSO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE RIGHT OR TO MEET THOSE REQUIREMENTS FOR K. IF THEY HADN'T DONE SO. WHAT I WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT AN EMPLOYER I'M SORRY IN AN EMPLOYEE WOULD HAVE TO MAKE THAT REQUEST. AFTER THIS LEGISLATION IS SIGNED AND THEN AN EMPLOYER WOULD HAVE TO NOT COMPLY AT THAT TIME BEFORE- CIVIL ACTION COULD BE TAKEN THANK YOU. UP BUT IF IT DOES BECOME AN ISSUE WITH THE AUTHOR COMMIT TO ADDRESSING THIS THE SPECIFIC ISSUES TO EMPLOYERS AREN'T HARM FOR THIS RETROACTIVELY. RETROACTIVITY IN THIS IMPORTANT IN IN MY BOOK. YEAH THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION- I I'LL HAVE TO GO BACK TO- HAVE A DISCUSSION IN TERMS OF HOW THE INTERACTION IS WITH MY COLLEAGUES BUT I HEAR I HEAR THE CONCERN- MISTER COOPER OKAY JUST IN A REALLY BIG ISSUE IS THAT A LOT OF US HAVE SMALL BUSINESSES IN OUR DISTRICT. INTERSPINOUS BEEN BEEN TOUGH ON THEM AND- YOU KNOW A LOT OF CLOSED IN THE ONE THE REMAINING- REALLY TEETERING ON THE BRINK OF SHUTTING DOWN SO- I THINK WE'VE GOT TO JUST BE VERY BALANCED IN OUR APPROACH TO MAKE SURE WE KEEP THE EMPLOY. A LARGE NUMBER OF CALIFORNIANS OF THANK YOU. YES I MAY I JUST ADD THAT- IN ISOLATION I UNDERSTAND I UNDERSTAND THE CONCERNS OF SOME OF THE MEMBERS. BUT I ALSO LIKE TO POINT OUT THE MANY- OF PROPOSALS THAT HAVE BEEN PASSED BY THE LEGISLATURE AND SIGNED INTO LAW BY THE GOVERNOR. THAT WOULD PROVIDE ADDITIONAL SMALL BUSINESS SUPPORTS INCLUDING FRANCE- ACCREDITS- THAT RELIEF IN OTHER FORMS. AND AGAIN THERE IS THAT EXEMPTION FOR SMALL BUSINESSES IN THIS BILL. WHICH I UNDERSTAND- ENCOMPASSES OVER CALIFORNIA SO JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT IN TOTALITY. THERE IS A PACKAGE OF- PROPOSALS THAT IS REALLY LOOKING AT. A TOTAL TOTAL NOT A TAX RELIEF AND- SUPPORT FOR SMALL BUSINESS THANK YOU. THANK YOU OTHER- QUESTIONS. COMMENTS THIS PRESS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- I THINK THAT THE WHAT I LIKE ABOUT THE BILL IS THAT IT DOES TRY TO FIND SOME BALANCE WE HAVE TO BE SURE THAT WE PROTECT OUR SMALL BUSINESSES BUT WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT. WE DO NOT DENY SICK LEAVE TO THOSE WHO ARE WORKING IN THE PUBLIC AND PUTTING THEIR THEIR LIFE IN DANGER FOR US WE ALSO WANNA MAKE SURE THAT I'M THAT SICK EMPLOYEES DON'T GO TO WORK SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT GOING TO RECEIVE ANY BENEFITS. OUGHT NOT SPECIFICALLY ON CARGO PLANES IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE WAS NO OUTPOURING OF PAGA LITIGATION OR FRIVOLOUS LAWSUITS AB EIGHTEEN SIXTY SEVEN OR THE FOOD WORKER EXECUTIVE ORDER- THE BILL BEFORE US SIMPLY EXTENDS EXISTING PRACTICE SO THE QUESTION THEN IS CAN CAN WOULD YOU CONFIRM THAT NO NEW PAGA RIGHTS OR OTHER PRIVATE RIGHTS OF ACTION OR AVENUES TOWARD LARGER WARDS HAVE BEEN CREATED IN THE BILL BEFORE US TODAY. YES AGAIN- HIGHLIGHT IN AGREE WITH- YOU IN REGARDS TO THAT THIS IS NOT ANYTHING NEW THIS IS A CONTINUATION OF- PROVISIONS THAT WERE PROVIDED IN AB EIGHTEEN SIXTY SEVEN. AND IT- THE- ALSO AGREED THAT THERE WAS NOT A SPIKE IN APOCALYPSE RELATED LITIGATION BUT I WILL TURN THE QUESTION VER FOR FURTHER DETAILS TO MY COLLEAGUE DANIEL BRANDON. THANK YOU MEMBER FOR THE QUESTION DANIELLE BRANDON AGAIN WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I'M LIKE MISLI HAD STATED AND WE'RE NOT AWARE OF- OF LARGE ON SET OF CLAIMS AS REGARDED THIS AND THEN PAGI GUEST. REALLY APPLIES IN CERTAIN AGREE JUST CASES AND EMPLOYERS ARE ALLOWED TO CURE THOSE VIOLATIONS BEFORE THE PENALTIES APPLY- WITH REGARD TO YOUR SPECIFIC SOME TALK THAT I MAY NEED TO DEFER TO THE LABOR COMMISSIONER IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING MORE SPECIFIC. ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU AND I ALSO WOULD ASK- IF YOU COULD PLEASE ELABORATE ON THE PAGA CLAIMS GOING FORWARD. DO THEY PENALIZE EMPLOYERS WHO HAVE MADE INSIGNIFICANT. OR GOOD FAITH ERRORS. THANK YOU DANIEL. GOD ANNA SORRY. MY APOLOGIES AND- THE BILL WOULD ALLOW AN EMPLOYEE TO REQUEST- TO BE MADE WHOLE UNDER THIS SPELL AT WHICH TIME THE EMPLOYER WOULD HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY BEFORE A CLAIM COULD BE FILED. THANK YOU AYE I THINK THAT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT- IN FINDING THAT BALANCE. THAT WE PROTECT OUR SMALL BUSINESSES THAT ARE THAT WOULD HAVE DONE SO MUCH DURING THIS PANDEMIC. BUT ALSO MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE PROTECTING OUR OUR EMPLOYEES WHO HAVE BEEN THE BACKBONE OF ALL THOSE JOBS THANK YOU. MYSTERONS. THANK YOU I'M THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. AND ON THE ISSUE OF- BUSINESSES WE KNOW THAT THE HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY HAS BEEN HIT PRETTY HARD ESPECIALLY IN- MY DISTRICT THE ASSEMBLY FORTY TH DISTRICT OF NOT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND WE KNOW THAT THAT THAT BUSINESSES IN GENERAL HAVE- SUFFERED- WE KNOW THAT SOME BUSINESSES HAVE GONE OUT OF BUSINESS DURING THIS- COVERT NINETEEN ERA. AND ORIGINALLY IN THIS BILL LAST YEAR WE HAVE PROTECTION FOR EMPLOYEES WITH FIVE HUNDRED EMPLOYEES OR LESS- AND NOW WE HAVE IN THEIR TWENTY FIVE EMPLOYEES OR LESS SO MY FIRST QUESTION IS GOING TO THE TWENTY FIVE EMPLOYEES OR LESS WHAT PERCENTAGE OF SMALL BUSINESSES DOES THAT REPRESENT HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. YES THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION- I BELIEVE THAT. AND I WILL TURN TO MY COLLEAGUE DANIEL RENDON FOR THE EXACT MEASURE BUT AGAIN THIS THIS BILL- WOULD REQUIRE ALL BUSINESSES. EXCEPT THOSE TWENTY WITH EMPLOYEES OF TWENTY FIVE OR LESS TO- PROVIDE THIS SICK LEAVE AND- DANIELLE RENDON CAN YOU PROVIDE SOME ADDITIONAL DETAILS IN REGARDS TO THE PERCENTAGE OF THE WHOLE THAT MAKES. IS THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION- I MAY HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT THE PERCENTAGE OF- THAT COVERS I BELIEVE IT IS ROUGHLY ABOUT 90% I AM. WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT FOLLOW UP AND- WHAT WAS THAT NUMBER MISTER. I WOULD LIKE AN APOLOGY IS THE MEMBER I WOULD LIKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET BACK TO YOU ON. GEN- AND CONFIRM I NEVER SO WE'RE NOT CLEAR ON WHAT PERCENT OF SMALL BUSINESSES THAT THAT 25% OF EMPLOYEES ACTUALLY AFFECTS. YES AT THIS TIME WE DON'T HAVE THAT FIGURE- WE CAN PROVIDE THAT TO YOU- THIS OF THIS COMMITTEE AFTER THE HEARING. THANK YOU- JUST BRING IT UP MISTER CHAIR AS FAR AS A BUSINESSES AND SECTORS THAT HAVE SORT OF BEEN HIT AND A LOT OF BUSINESSES CONTINUE TO GO OUT OF BUSINESS- BUT ALSO I WANT- YOU KNOW- CONFIRMATION THAT THIS- ACTUAL- BILL. THE WRITER BILL HERE TRAILER BILL WILL EXPIRE IN SEPTEMBER OF. TWENTY TWENTY ONE. YES THAT IS PRACTICE BUILT ON SITE AT THE END OF SEPTEMBER OF THIS YEAR. THANK YOU- AND WE CANNOT GET MAYBE AN EMAIL OR SOMETHING IN IN REAL TIME TO GIVE US THAT NUMBER OF THE- PERCENTAGES OF SMALL BUSINESSES THAT TWENTY FIVE EMPLOYEES OR LESS. ACTUALLY WILL COVER IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DEEPLY APPRECIATED THANK YOU MR JEFF. I THINK THE OTHER THING TO ADD WOULD JUST ALSO BE- TO PROVIDE CONTEXT AS THE- NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES WILL LOOK AT THE OTHER WITH THE NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES THAT THE BILL WILL COVER TO. BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THERE'S A- VERY LARGE NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES IN THE IN THE OTHER POCKET SELF. YES WE'LL GET THAT INFORMATION TO YOU. THANK YOU MISTER SMITH THANK YOU VERY MUCH ON UP NUMBER FOUR ON THE PROVISIONS OF THE SUMMARY SPECIFICALLY SAYS FIREFIGHTERS WOULDN'T COVER THE OTHER PUBLIC SAFETY AGENCIES IN THE STATE. BECAUSE I'M JUST THINKING OF YOUR DETECTIVE YOU DON'T JUST STOP AT FORTY HOURS ON A CASE YOU KEEP GOING UNTIL YOU. REACH A CONCLUSION TO THE CASE. BUT WHY DOES IT SAY JUST FIREFIGHTERS BUT NOT ALL PUBLIC SAFETY PERSONNEL. I HAD A QUESTION TO MY COLLEAGUE DANIEL RENDON THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU MEMBER FACT QUESTION DANIEL BRANDON I AM GOING TO HAVE TO AND GET BACK TO YOU WITH THAT QUESTION AS WELL AND WITH SPECIFICALLY WITH SAFETY- THE INTENT OF THE BILL IS THAT ALL EMPLOYEES ARE COVERED IF THEY WORK FOR AN EMPLOYER WITH MORE THAN TWENTY FIVE EMPLOYEES- AND SO I WILL FOLLOW UP SPECIFIC. OKAY. OTHER MISS RUBIO. THOSE ARE JUST MAKING A FOLLOW UP YES INCOME FROM MY FELLOW COLLEAGUES OF **** AND CO WE NEED AN ANSWER BECAUSE WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE VOTING ON THIS THIS AFTERNOON SO IF YOU COULD GET A ANSWER FOR VERBALLY BEFORE NOON TODAY SO WE CAN RESEARCH HAS. TO BE VERY HELPFUL THANK YOU. THANK YOU THIS RUBIO. THANK YOU MISTER TERRY THE IT'S THE EXACT SAME COMMENTER FOR EXPECTED TO VOTE ON THIS ITEM AT TWO AFTER TWO PM TODAY THAT INFORMATION SHOULD HAVE BEEN AVAILABLE FOR US THIS MORNING SOLD- I UNDERSTAND BAD THAT WERE BEING OFFERED THE INFORMATION AFTER THIS MEETING BY- SOMEBODY SHOULD HAVE THAT INFORMATION AVAILABLE HOPEFULLY BY THE TIME THE MEETING AND- THANK YOU. THANK YOU. MISFIRES THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN SO AS SOMEBODY WHO COMES FROM A SMALL BUSINESS PERSPECTIVE IN A WORLD I'M REALLY CONCERNED THAT WHEN ARE SMALL SMALL BUSINESSES AND BUSINESSES ACROSS CALIFORNIA HAVE REALLY STEPPED UP TO THE PLATE OVER THE LAST YEAR. I'VE HEARD STORIES FROM EMPLOYERS AND COMPANIES IN MY DISTRICT TO HAVE KEPT EMPLOYEES ON JUST SO THAT THEY WOULD EVEN THOUGH THEY HAD NO WORK JUST SO THEY COULD CONTINUE THEIR HEALTH INSURANCE. SO I'M REALLY CONCERNED THAT WE'RE NOT TAKING A BALANCED APPROACH APPROACH WITH THIS. I DO WANT TO KNOW THE WHAT HOW AND WHY WAS A TWENTY FIVE EMPLOYEE THRESHOLD DEEMED. THE CUT OFF. HIGHER COOLEY WITH A PERMANENT FINANCE- AGAIN IN RECOGNITION OF- THE FISCAL IMPACT ON SMALL BUSINESSES. THAT TWENTY FIVE EMPLOYEES OR LESS- WAS A POINT THAT SEEM TO COINCIDE WITH SOME OF THE SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION- PROPOSALS AT THE FEDERAL LAW OKAY- AND ENCOMPASSED- MANY OF THE SMALL BUSINESSES AGAIN WE'LL GET YOU THAT NUMBER BUT WITH IN CALIFORNIA. IT IS JUST CONCERNING THAT WE PICKED THIS NUMBER YET WE DON'T REALLY KNOW HOW IT IMPACTS THE VAST MAJORITY OF BUSINESSES. THANK YOU MISS MCCARTY. YEAH I KNOW THIS IS AN INFORMATIONAL HEARING WE'RE NOT VOTING AGES FLESHING OUT THE DETAILS AND I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT TWO THINGS WHICH I THINK ARE IMPORTANT- FIRST IS WORK IN THE MIDDLE OF PANDEMIC AND HOPEFULLY WILL BE OVER IN THE COMING MONTHS AND VACCINES ARE ROLLING OUT AND THINGS ARE CERTAINLY CHANGING AND WE DO HAVE AN END DATE FOR THIS POLICY AS MISTER. AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAMBAR DINO ASKS WHO WAS IT WAS REITERATED THAT WE DO HAVE AN END DATE FOR THIS. AND THEN I THINK TO NOTE. THAT IF YOU LOOK AT THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT ARE EMPLOYED BY SMALL BUSINESS AND KEEP IN THE UNITED STATES IN CALIFORNIA. THE MAJORITY OF THEM ARE FROM SMALLER BUSINESSES OF. LESS THAN FIFTEEN LESS THAN TEN LESS THAN FIVE. LAST YEAR WE HAD THE BIG CONTROVERSIAL DEBATE ON PAID FAMILY LEAVE. I BELIEVE THE FINAL- NUMBER WAS MUCH MUCH LOWER. SO BY THE FACT THAT WE'RE GOING UP TO TWENTY FIVE I THINK. HAS SOME RECOGNITION THAT THE SMALLER BUSINESSES WITH. THE MAJORITY OF ISN'T CALIFORNIA HAVE JUST A FEW EMPLOYEES AND THEY DON'T HAVE. PERSONNEL TO TEAMS IN PAYROLL- TEAMS AND CONSULTANTS ALL FIGURED OUT. SO I THINK BY THE FACT THAT WE ARE GOING TO TWENTY FIVE. IT'S A FAIR COMPROMISE HIS TO FALL BECAUSE ONE THERE A LOT OF PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA WHO ARE GOING TO GET SICK YOU CAN'T TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS BECAUSE THEY WORK. FOR AN EMPLOYER WITH UNDER TWENTY FIVE IN THE MAJORITY PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA. FRANKLY WON'T BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE BECAUSE THEY WORK FOR. AN EMPLOYER. THAT HAS FEWER THAN TWENTY FIVE EMPLOYEES SO- I THINK THAT- YOU KNOW MANY WOULD PUSH THE OTHER WAY THAT WE SHOULD GO DOWN TO FIVE OR LESS. OR EVEN FEWER SO I JUST THINK WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WE- RECONCILE THOSE TWO FACTS THANK YOU. THANK YOU OF MISTER BENNETT THE MISCREANTS. I DON'T QUESTION THEIR AGO BOB. I WOULD JUST LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT THE IMPORTANT THING HERE IS THAT WE'RE MAKING A GOOD FAITH EFFORT TO TRY TO PROTECT WORKERS AND STILL COME UP WITH SOME KIND OF BALANCE SAYS- MY COLLEAGUE- MENTIONED IN WHEN YOU HAVE PROTECTIONS BUILT IN FOR EXAMPLE. THE EMPLOYER CAN MAKE THE EMPLOYEE HOLE. ONE NOTIFIED OF AN ERROR MESSAGE- THAT I THINK REALLY INDICATES WE ARE MAKING A GOOD FAITH EFFORT. IT'S ONLY THE BAD ACTORS THAT YOU REALLY TRYING TO FORCES LEGISLATION DOWN AND MOST WORK SITUATIONS ONCE THIS LEGISLATION IS AFTER AND IT'S ONLY FOR EMPLOYERS OF TWENTY FIVE OR MORE- I THINK YOU YOU CAN CERTAINLY CALDERON- EVERYBODY THAT'S TRYING TO MAKE A GOOD FAITH EFFORT. WILL NOT GET TRIPPED UP WITH SOME TECHNICALITIES HERE THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU MISS KOREA THE MISSED MEDINA. THANKS TEST THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- AND THANK YOU MEMBERS. I THINK ALL OF US. IN THE PAST YEAR AS WE REACH THE ONE YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF OUR GOING INTO QUARANTINE AND- REALLY THAT THE IMPACT OF COPA NINETEEN WE HAVE ALL. KNOWN SOMEONE ESPECIALLY HERE IN THIS BODY IN THIS BUILDING THAT HAS BEEN COLD BUT POSITIVE WE HAVE ALL BEEN IMPACTED BY SOMEONE WHO HAS. UNFORTUNATELY PASSED AWAY BECAUSE OF CULVERT. I HAVE NOT BEEN VOCAL ABOUT THIS PUBLICLY BUT I HAVE ALSO LOST FAMILY BECAUSE OF COVERT NINETEEN AND IT IS. INCREDIBLY PAINFUL IT IS PAINFUL TO THINK ABOUT ESSENTIAL AND FRONTLINE WORKERS WHO ARE RISKING THEIR LIVES EVERY DAY WHO HAVE RISKED THEIR LIVES. EVERY DAY SO THAT THE MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIANS COULD STAY HOME AND QUARANTINE AND ISOLATE AND GET THEIR GROCERIES DELIVERED THEY'RE STILL A HUMAN BEING BEHIND THAT DELIVERY. THERE'S A HUMAN BEING BEHIND. SOMEONE WHO WAS STOCKING THE GROCERY STORE THERE IS A HUMAN BEING AT YOUR FAVORITE THAI RESTAURANT THAT YOU GET DELIVERED THROUGH YOUR FAVORITE APPS THAT CONTINUES TO BE EXPOSED EVERY SINGLE DAY. WE ARE DOING THE VERYBEST WE CAN TO HAVE BOTH PROTECTIONS FOR SMALL BUSINESSES WHICH WE WORKED REALLY HARD ON. END AND ALSO DO THE WORK NECESSARY THAT WE NEED TO DO TO ENSURE THAT CALIFORNIANS ARE PROTECTED OUR MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES IS NOT A CONVERSATION ABOUT EITHER AND I HAVE BEEN. I HAVE BEEN FRUSTRATED AND AMUSED AT THE SAME TIME. THAT THE CONVERSATIONS ARE SINGULAR IT'S EITHER BUSINESS OR IT'S EITHER WORKERS AND I'M HERE TO TELL YOU TODAY AND I WILL MOVE THIS FORWARD EVERY DAY THAT I CONTINUE TO SERVE IN THIS ASSEMBLY. THAT IT'S BOTH WE CAN DO BOTH WE CAN PROTECT OUR SMALL BUSINESSES WHICH ARE THE BACKBONE. OF THE CALIFORNIA AND THE AMERICAN ECONOMY ECONOMY BUSINESSES IN MY DISTRICT THAT I LOVE. AND THAT I DON'T WANT TO SEE SHUT DOWN. WHILE AT THE SAME TIME WE CAN PROTECT THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF THE WORKERS THAT MAKE OUR ECONOMY RUN WE CAN DO BOTH AND WE SHOULD. DO BOTH. I WENT TO REALLY QUICKLY ON TO THE S. P. A. DOT GOV WEBSITE AND I WAS ABLE TO LOOK UP NUMBERS FOR. A CALIFORNIA SMALL BUSINESSES AND IN FACT IS VERY IS LAID OUT VERY. VERY SIMPLY WANT TO TWENTY EMPLOYERS IN A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT- TYPES OF INDUSTRIES- TOTALING UP TO SIX HUNDRED AND FORTY THREE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY ONE. THIS INFORMATION IS READILY AVAILABLE FOR ALL OF US. I'M MORE THAN HAPPY TO ENSURE THAT OUR OUR BUDGET STAFF SINCE IT OUT TO THE YOU CAN MAKE A CONCISE DECISION INFILL TRUST AND DECISION THAT YOU'RE MAKING. ULTIMATELY KNOW THAT AT THE END OF THE DAY WHEN WE DID- AB EIGHTEEN SIXTY SEVEN. IT ONLY COVERED FIVE HUNDRED PLUS A SIMPLE- EMPLOYERS BECAUSE FEDERAL LAW COVERED LESS THAN FIVE HUNDRED. WE WERE WE WERE TRYING TO FIND THE SAFETY NET. FOR SMALL BUSINESSES AND ARE WORKING COMMUNITY TO ENSURE THAT THEY GET PROTECTED. THE BUSINESSES THAT HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED FOR TWENTY FIVE AND UNDER I AM NOT HAPPY WITH THAT NUMBER. SEVERAL PEOPLE AREN'T HAPPY WITH THAT NUMBER SOME PEOPLE ACTUALLY WANTED LESS FIRE UNLESS EXCEPTIONS. AND THAT'S OKAY WE CAME UP WITH TWENTY FIVE THE SMALL BUSINESS. ADMINISTRATION TITLES AT ONE TO TWENTY- STAFF. AND WE CAME TO AN AGREEMENT AND IT ISN'T PERFECT. BUT IT'S AN AGREEMENT THAT WE CAME UP WITH% THAT THIS BODY FEELS GOOD WITH THE SENATE BILLS GOOD WITH. AND HOPEFULLY THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE IS ALSO. IN A GOOD PLACE WITH. AN AYE SURE THAT TO SAY THAT. TWENTY FIVE AND UP COVERS TEN POINT FOUR MILLION WORKERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. BUT IT IS THE SMALL BUSINESSES AND I HOPE THAT EVERYONE THAT'S TALKING ABOUT SMALL BUSINESSES CAN COME TO THE TABLE AND WORK WITH ME SO THAT WE ENSURE THAT THOSE THAT ARE TWENTY FIVE AND UNDER ALSO HAVE PROTECTIONS. YOUR FAVORITE COFFEE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER IF ONE EMPLOYEE GETS. COVERED IN ITS COVERT POSITIVE AND THEN AND FAX THE OTHER WORKERS AND THEN POTENTIALLY HARMS THE HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF THE PEOPLE THAT ARE COMING IN TO GET THAT FAVORITE COFFEE GUESS WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. YOUR COFFEE SHOP IS GOING TO BE A HOT ZONE AND YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO SHUT DOWN. NONE OF US WANT THAT. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT ARE SMALL BUSINESSES ARE PROTECTED. THAT EMPLOYEES ARE PROTECTED. THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO CARE FOR A SICK FAMILY MEMBER. WE ARE ROLLING OUT THE VACCINES AND THERE'S ISSUES WITH VACCINE EQUITY THAT I'M SEEN IN MY COMMUNITY EVERY SINGLE DAY IN ANOTHER COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IT IS NOT AN EQUITABLE PROCESS WE ARE NOT DONE. WITH COLD IT. IT'S STILL SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE TO LIVE THROUGH. AND THERE IS A SUNSET DATE. TO BE SPECIFIC AND TO BE HELPFUL AND IT FALLS IN LINE WITH THE FEDERAL. GOVERNMENT GUIDELINES. EVERY BUSINESS IS ENTITLED TO A TAX CREDIT. OUR CHARGE IF YOU CARE ABOUT SMALL BUSINESSES AND I HOPE THAT YOU DO. IS HOW DO WE NOW ENSURE THAT THOSE TWENTY FIVE AND UNDER HAVE ACCESS TO THE SAME TAX CREDITS WHICH ARE AVAILABLE. THROUGH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT THEY MAY NOT KNOW ABOUT BECAUSE WE'RE NOT ADDRESSING IT THROUGH THIS. SO I WOULD URGE YOU TO SUPPORT THIS BILL. TO YES ASK YOUR QUESTIONS. BUT THEN UNDERSTAND THAT THE ANSWERS ARE THERE. AND THERE WE ARE WORKING REALLY HARD TO ENSURE THAT WE GET TO A GOOD PLACE. AND THAT ULTIMATELY EVEN THE SMALL BUSINESSES THAT ARE EXEMPTED FROM THIS BILL. HAVE THE SAME PROTECTIONS WHICH ARE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE UNDER FEDERAL GUIDELINES INTO THE END OF SEPTEMBER. THAT'S MY CHARGE AS WELL. BECAUSE I KNOW YOU DON'T ONLY CARE ABOUT THE BUSINESSES THAT ARE TWENTY FIVE AND MORE. THE BREAD THE BREAD AND BUTTER BUSINESSES IN OUR COMMUNITIES THAT MAKE OUR COMMUNITY THRIVES THE IMMIGRANT- YOU KNOW WHAT HOW CAN RESTAURANT IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD. THAT NEED SUPPORT THAT ONLY HAS TEN EMPLOYEES I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT IMMIGRANT OWNED SMALL BUSINESS RESTAURANT KNOWS. THAT THEY CAN STILL OFFER THEIR EMPLOYEE THOSE TWO WEEKS EVEN THOUGH IT'S NOT IN THIS BILL. AND IT IS OUR CHARGE TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE ACCESS TO THAT INFORMATION. SO I HOPE THAT ALL OF YOU THAT ARE SAYING YOU CARE ABOUT YOUR SMALL BUSINESSES. THAT YOU ALSO CARE ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT THEY GET THE INFORMATION- IT'S BEEN. A TOUGH YEAR MORE THAN HALF A MILLION AMERICANS HAVE LOST THEIR LIVES TO. THEN THE PANDEMIC MRE THAN HALF A MILLION. MORE THAN FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND OF THOSE LIVE HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND WE CAN DELIBERATE ALL WE WANT. FULLER STILL GETTING SICK AND PEOPLE ARE STILL DYING AND THEY ARE ESSENTIAL WORKERS IN MY COMMUNITY AND ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES THAT WE NEED TO PROTECT JUST AS WE ARE PROTECTING SMALL BUSINESSES WITH ALL THE SMALL BUSINESS RELIEF PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE PASSED ALREADY. WE CAN DO THE SAME FOR PEOPLE. BECAUSE WITHOUT PEOPLE. THOSE SMALL BUSINESSES DON'T SURVIVE THEY NEED EACH OTHER AND WE CAN DO BOTH. SO I URGE YOU TO PLEASE YES DO EVERYTHING WE POSSIBLY CAN TO PROTECT SMALL BUSINESS AND ENSURE THAT THEY DON'T CLOSE I WANT THAT. BUT I ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT NO ONE DIES ALONG THE WAY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MR MEDINA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. AND FOLLOWING UP ON MY COLLEAGUES FROM LOS ANGELES- OUR COMMUNICATION. ON ON PAID SICK LEAVE SO IN A PRACTICAL SENSE HOW ARE THE CHANGES AND BENEFITS COMMUNICATED TO EMPLOYEES AND EMPLOYERS ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO FOCUSES ON HUMAN RESOURCES. SO HOW DO WE COMMUNICATE HOW TO BUSINESSES AND EMPLOYEES I RECEIVED THE INFORMATION. ON THE CHANGES SURE. AGAIN THIS IS- THESE ARE NOT THESE ARE NOT NEW CHANGES THIS IS A CONTINUATION OF THE CURRENT PROGRAM BOTH AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL AND STATE LEVEL AND SO THE MEANS OF COMMUNICATION- SHOULD BE THE SAME AS IN THE BEGINNING FOR THE PREVIOUS PROGRAMS AND THAT WOULD BE- HUMAN RESOURCES IN- BUSINESSES- AS WELL AS- INFORMATION- FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS AND LABOR COMMISSIONER- THERE ARE. IO'S THAT ARE WORKING WITH STAKEHOLDER GROUPS AS WELL AND SO THERE ARE OTHER WAYS IN WHICH- FORMAL AND INFORMAL IN WHICH WORKERS AND WE SHOULD BE GETTING THIS INFORMATION A PLAYER SHOULD BE SHARING THAT INFORMATION OUT. AND THEN IS THERE A ROLE FOR THE STATE AND FOLLOWING UP WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE BENEFITS AND WHAT WOULD THAT ROLE BE. IN THE IMPLEMENTATION AND- FOLLOW UP. SURE PROBABLY SPEAKING- THE LABOR COMMISSIONER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ENFORCEMENT OF- LABOR LAWS AND THIS WOULD BE- INCLUDED UNDER THAT- I THINK FOR FURTHER DETAILS ALTERNATE QUESTION TO DANIEL BRANDON THANK YOU. YES DANIEL BRAND WITH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THE LABOR COMMISSIONER DOES HAVE THE ABILITY TO GO AND DO INVESTIGATIONS- FOR IN SITUATIONS WHERE A COMPLAINT ARISES WE JUST ALSO NOTE THAT TIME THERE RE CERTAIN PROTECTIONS. UNDER THE DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING AGAINST. OR OTHER- SUCH VIOLATIONS THANK YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU ISRAEL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I JUST WANT TO ACTUALLY STAND UP AND TALK ABOUT THE PROCESS AND REALLY APPRECIATE THE ENGAGEMENT THAT WE HAVE HAD SEVERAL OF US HAD ISSUES WITH WITH THE BILL IN ITS ORIGINAL FORM AND IN THE LAST TWO WEEKS WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH YOUR OFFICE AND MISS CREEL'S OFFICE TO TRYING TO GET SOME SOME- HELP FOR SOME OF THESE BUSINESSES AND SO JUST FOR THE REST OF OUR COLLEAGUES WE CAME UP WITH. WITH THE TWENTY FIVE AND UNDER- BUSINESS- ASSISTANCE BUT ALSO WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT THOSE MISSED THOSE BUSINESSES THAT HAVE TWENTY FIVE AND UNDER EMPLOYEES CAN ALSO GET HELP THEY HAVE TAX BREAKS FOR THIS IT IS NOT A PERFECT BILL AND WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT- WE HAD ASKED FOR MORE- MORE AMENDMENTS AND I'M YOU KNOW WE GOT THREE OUT OF THE FIVE REQUESTS THAT WE HAVE PUT IN AND WHICH I THINK IS YOU MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION OF CARS YOU KNOW- BUT NOT EVERYBODY'S GOING TO BE HAPPY AND I APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT WE HAVE BEEN WORKING TOGETHER- TO THAT END- I THINK THAT IN A GOOD NEGOTIATION PROCESS. BOTH SIDES ARE NEVER HAPPY AND I WANT TO JUST ACKNOWLEDGE THAT AT THE END WE ARE HELPING- BUSINESSES BUT WE'RE ALSO HELPING THOSE EMPLOYEES THAT DO SERVE OUR BUSINESS OUR OUR BUSINESS COMMUNITY AGAIN IT IS NOT A PERFECT ALIBIED UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND- DURING THE PANDEMIC NOTHING HAS BEEN ARE PREDICTABLE AND SO I DO APPRECIATE THE ENGAGEMENT THAT WE HAVE HAD WE STILL WOULD LIKE TO SEE SOME FURTHER- OF A COMPILE CONVERSATION ON THE RETROACTIVITY THAT'S BEEN A AN ISSUE FOR US AS WELL. BUT AGAIN I THINK THAT- WE HAVE BEEN NEGOTIATING IN GOOD FAITH AND I APPRECIATE ON THE COMMITTEE'S INVOLVEMENT AND THE RESPONSIVENESS THAT WE'VE HAVE HAD THANK YOU THANK YOU MISS RUBIO AND I THINK YOUR YOUR POINT IS WELL TAKEN I KNOW THAT THERE ARE OTHR COMMITTEE MEMBERS WHO DIDN'T WANT ANY EXEMPTIONS IN TERMS OF NUMBER EMPLOYEES SO I THINK YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THAT THIS IS. VERY MUCH A COMPROMISE AND IT'S A COMPROMISE THAT TRIES. TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT ON BUSINESS IS TWENTY FIVE AND OVER IN ALSO TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE WERE TWENTY FIVE AND UNDER. ARE ARE EXEMPTED AND REALLY ARE ARE GIVEN. TAX BREAKS AND GIVEN OPPORTUNITIES AND GIVEN THIS IS ON TOP OF THE GRANTS THAT WERE GIVING AS WELL SO. IT'S REALLY TRYING TO STRIKE A BALANCE AND BE SENSITIVE TO. I THINK EVERYONE'S NEEDS AND I THINK AS- MY COLLEAGUE FROM LA ALSO POINTED OUT. THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. BUSINESSES CONTINUE TO OPERATE AND THRIVE AT THE SAME TIME THAT. EMPLOYEES DON'T HAVE TO MAKE THIS CHOICE OF IF I'M SICK DO I DO I GO TO WORK I NEED THAT PAYCHECK SO AGAIN. WHAT WE TRY TO STRIKE THAT BALANCE I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THAT COMMENT AND- WELL WE KNOW THAT WILL BE CONTINUING THIS CONVERSATION ABSOLUTELY. MISTER CHAIR MAY I PROVIDE THE COMMITTEE WITH SOME FURTHER DETAILS IN REGARDS TO THEIR QUESTIONS REGULAR GREAT GO HEAD OKAY. SHARE BUT- WE UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY A MILLION SMALL BUSINESSES THAT WOULD BE EXEMPTED AS- IN REGARDS TO THE TWENTY FIVE EMPLOYEES OR LESS. THAT'S ABOUT TWO POINT FIVE MILLION- WORKERS IN THE STATE. OF ABOUT A TOTAL OF. AROUND NINETEEN MILLION- WORKERS TO JUST WANTED TO PROVIDE THAT FOR CONTEXT- BUT I ALSO- APPRECIATE THE STATEMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE IN REGARDS TO THE OVERALL AGAIN. OVERALL PACKAGE. OF SUPPORTS AND RELIEF THAT ARE. THAT THIS ADMINISTRATIONIS LEGISLATURE HAVE BEEN COMMITTED TO PROVIDING TO SMALL BUSINESS IN. REGARDS TO THE WAIVERS- SMALL BUSINESS GRANTS- SMALL SMALL BUSINESS- PAYMENT DEFERRALS FOR SALES AND USE TAXES AS WELL AS OTHER CREDITS- IT AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR HOLDING AND I'M STRUCTURE. THANK YOU MISLI OTHER. MISTER COOPER. JUST A COMMON MISTER CHAIR I THINK ABOUT PARTISAN WOULD GOTTEN ARGUE WITH- CALLING FROM- LA- BUBBLE HILLS THAT IT IT'S A BILL IS NOT THE BEST BILL BUT IT'S A IT'S A GOOD MIDDLE GROUND AND IN MY OPINION COULD HAPPEN A LONG TIME AGO BECAUSE WE LEFT THE ALL OF US DON'T DO A GOOD JOB OF COMMUNICATING AND TALKING ABOUT THIS IN THE BILL'S COMING IT'S A BIG IMPORTANT BILL ACTUALLY GET INTO IT. AND ALSO THE BILL COMES OUT THIS FORM THERE'S PUSH BACK BUT I THINK DIALOGUE HAS TO HAPPEN A LOT EARLIER IN SOME OF THESE BILLS IN THE SESSION THE OTHER SCOLDED BUT WE HAVE PLENTY OF TIME DURING CAUCUS AND OTHER MEETINGS TO REALLY TALK ABOUT THESE ISSUES AND WE HAVEN'T DONE THAT IN IN SHAME ON US WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. A LOT OF SUPERFLUOUS THINGS THAT REALLY DON'T. YOU SERVE THE PEOPLE WELL. AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE MORE BILLS THIS YEAR SO HOPEFULLY. LESS THIS WILL GAUGE AND MORE ROBUST DIALOGUE. BEFORE COMES BEFORE BEFORE WE HAD IF WE CAN. TRY TO RESOLVE SOME OF THESE THINGS AND- I KNOW TWENTY FIVE A GOOD NUMBER BUT- LET'S BE HONEST THERE. ARE SOME RESTAURANTS THAT EMPLOY TWENTY FIVE PEOPLE. FOR OPEN FROM LUNCHTIME TO DINNER. IT'S VERY EASY GO THAT TWENTY FIVE PERSON THING SO. I KNOW FINANCES QUOTED A NUMBER OF WHATEVER ONE MILLION BUT STILL. A LOT OF FAMILY OWNED RESTAURANTS. SMALL BUSINESSES. DO EMPLOY MORE THAN TWENTY FIVE PEOPLE. IN WORK SO THAT'S THAT'S THE TOUGH PART BECAUSE IT REALLY AFFECTS THEM AND- I HEAR. DAY IN AND DAY OUT OF. MY DISTRICT IS VERY DIVERSE. A LOT OF RESTAURANTS BEEN IMPACTED BY THIS SO. TWENTY FIVE GOOD. BUT IS STILL IN PATH ONE FOLKS THAT ARE GOING TO HAVE TROUBLE. THANK YOU MR. THANK THANK YOU MISTER FROM THE STRESS. TO OF FOLLOW UP AND JUST AS THE- OF CLARA. I DO WANT TO CONFIRM THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN. SIGNED BY PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN. WILL REIMBURSE COVERED EMPLOYERS FOR THE COST OF PROVIDING THE SICK LEAVE IS THAT CORRECT. THAT IS CORRECT- AND IT IS THIS UNDER THE SAME COMPENSATION TERMS THAT WAS PROVIDED UNDER THE ORIGINAL- FAMILY FIRST ACT. WHICH IS FIVE HUNDRED ELEVEN DOLLARS PER DAY WITH A CAP OF OVER JUST OVER FIVE THOUSAND SO YES THE CREDIT WILL BE A DOLLAR DOLLAR DOLLAR FOR DOLLAR COMPENSATION- CREDIT TO THE EMPLOYER. THANK YOU. OKAY MISTER COOPER THE MYSTERY SURE MR IS MORPHING TALKED EARLIER ABOUT THE PRIOR BILL AND IT JUST ANOTHER PART BILL IS NOT RETROACTIVE IN FACT HAD A TEN DAY FACING IS THAT CORRECT. FROM FINANCE. I BELIEVE THAT IS CORRECT SO I'M TO OPEN I HEARD SOME PEOPLE TALK ABOUT EARLIER YOU COMPARING APPLES AND ORANGES SO LIKE I SAID IT WAS A TEN DAY PHASE IN. AND NOT RETROACTIVE SO TO ME IN MY MIND THAT'S A BIG DIFFERENCE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. MISCREANT. I JUST WANTED TO ADD TO I BELIEVE WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE JUST SAID- REGARDING BEAT MICHAEL MY COLLEAGUES QUESTION- FOR EXAMINERS ARE ADDING. THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN IT ALSO INCLUDES WILL WE HAVE. EXCLUDED THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN INCLUDES ALL BUSINESSES INCLUDING THE ONES THAT ARE TWENTY FIVE AND UNDER WHICH WE ARE NOT. COVERING UNDER THIS PROPOSAL. SO AGAIN FOR EVERYONE THAT'S CONCERNED ABOUT SMALL BUSINESSES I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THE TWENTY FIVE AND UNDER. WHICH INCLUDE SMALL RESTAURANTS THAT ARE NOT OPERATING AT FULL CAPACITY. THAT DO NOT HAVE THE TWENTY FIVE AND UP THAT THEY WOULD TRADITIONALLY HAVE. BECAUSE OF CODE. BECAUSE OF CLOSURES BECAUSE OF ALL THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE EXPERIENCE IN THE LAST YEAR. SO I HOPE THAT THERE IS AN EFFORT IN THIS BODY. TO ALSO HELP THE TWENTY FIVE AND UNDER EVEN THOUGH WE ARE EXCLUDING THEM. KNOWING THAT THERE IS A FAT THERE IS FEDERAL SUPPORT FOR TAX CREDITS. SO THAT THOSE EMPLOYEES CAN ALSO. BE PROTECTED UNDER COVERT PAID SICK LEAVE. IT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE DOING IN THE STATE RIGHT NOW BUT IT IS AVAILABLE. AND I HOPE. THAT WE ALL DO THE WORK NECESSARY TO ENSURE THAT THOSE THAT ARE STILL. TWENTY FIVE AND UNDER NO. THAT THEY CAN STILL APPLY FOR THOSE TAX CREDITS THEY CAN STILL OPERATE AND THEY CAN STILL SUPPORT THEIR EMPLOYEES. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MAY I ADD TO THAT STATEMENT YES. YEAH OKAY AT YES AND I JUST WANT TO ALSO SAY THAT THE FEDERAL LAW IS ONLY FORTY EMPLOYERS A FIVE HUNDRED OR LESS AND THIS- SB NINETY FIVE NINETY. FIVE WHERE- APPLIES TO ALL EMPLOYERS- OVER TWENTY FIVE AND I'M TO THE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS POINTS. THOSE BUSINESSES AND BUSINESSES MAY STILL OFFER THE PAID SICK LEAVE AND RECEIVE THE FEDERAL CREDIT THEIR DOES NOT MANDATED TO DO SO. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER THIS IS MISTER RAMOS RIGHT OKAY YOUR VIEWS RISING ARE HEADING UP THANK YOU MISTER TRAVIS WANNA REITERATE- THE SUPPORT FOR OUR SMALL BUSINESS COMMUNITY OUT IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AS THEY CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD- AND MAKING SURE THAT WHEN WE STARTED OFF IT WAS FIVE HUNDRED BOYS ARE LESS NOW WE'RE AT TWENTY FIVE EMPLOYEES OR LESS AND I THINK THE- STAFF IN THE PRESENTERS FOR BRINGING BACK THAT INFORMATION ON THE SMALL BUSINESSES IN THE IMPACT THAT'S THERE. CERTAINLY WE ALSO WANT TO SPEAK UP FOR THE SMALL BUSINESSES THAT HAVE GONE OUT OF BUSINESS DURING COVERT NINETEEN AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUE TO WORKING WITH EVERYBODY IN THIS BODY TO MAKE SURE ALL EMPLOYEES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- I HAVE A SAFE AND SECURE PLACE TO WORK BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S A PLACE FOR THEM TO WORK AND SUPPORTING OUR BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA.

MISTER SINISTER BRAMBLE SPEAKING THIS MORNING ON BEHALF OF THE THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND TEN THOUSAND MEMBERS OF THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION JUST URGING THE SUPPORT FOR THE PAID SICK LEAVE PROPOSAL. SENATE BILL NINETY FIVE QUICK QUICK PERSONAL ANECDOTE MY HOUSEHOLD CONTRACTED COVERT NINETEEN AND CAME OUT ON THE OTHER SIDE THANKFULLY- I'M LUCKY TO BE ABLE TO WORK FROM HOME BUT MY WIFE WORKS IN THE PAYROLL OFFICE AT THE ELK GROVE UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. WORKERS NEED THEIR PAYCHECKS EVEN DURING THIS GLOBAL PANDEMIC SO SHE MUST REPORT TO WORK WHEN THE FIRST MEMBER OF OUR HOUSEHOLD MY DAUGHTER TESTED POSITIVE IN JANUARY OF THIS YEAR.

GOOD MORNING THIS IS ACTUALLY HOW CAN ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE FIRST AND FOREMOST WE WANT TO TAKE LEADERSHIP FOR DRAFTING MANY OF THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY CONCERNED ABOUT SB NINETY FIVE IN THE MARCH TWELFTH AMENDMENT THAT SPECIALLY THE EXEMPTION FOR OUR SMALLER. SAYS WE STILL HOWEVER HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE CONTINUED PRESSURE EXCUSE CALIFORNIA'S EMPLOYER IT IS A SAFETY NET FOR THE STATE OF THE NINETEEN RESPONSE ESPECIALLY THE MACALESTER REGULATION ALREADY MANDATES THAT ANY EMPLOYEE WITH KEPCO THE NINETEEN OR WHO HAS POTENTIALLY BEEN EXPOSED. MUST BE EXCLUDED WITH FULL PAY AND BENEFITS FOR A MINIMUM OF TEN DAYS MOST CONCERNING IS A PROVISION MAKING A SWEEP OBLIGATION RETROACTIVE TO JANUARY FIRST IN A TIME WHEN EMPLOYERS ARE CAREFULLY PLANNING HOW THEY WILL SPEND EVERY PENNY TO PREPARE FOR THE FUTURE AND ENSURE THEY CAN COVER PAYROLL AN EMPLOYER COULD BE INUNDATED WITH REQUESTS TO RETRACT THAT STATEMENT. WELL THERE ARE SOME FEDERAL TAX CREDIT MOST OF THE QUALIFYING REASONS ARE LIMITED FOR THE GENERAL TAX CREDIT TO TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS PER DAY FOR THE CALIFORNIA LAW HAS A FIVE HUNDRED ELEVEN DOLLARS PER K. CAP FOR EVERY SINGLE QUALIFYING RESENT. THE RETROACTIVE APPLICATION IS ALSO A MASSIVE ADMINISTRATIVE PART AND IT'S NOT CLEAR HOW TO RECONCILE THE SLOT WITH THE SITUATION WHERE AN EMPLOYEE WAS THAT JANUARY NEWS PTO SICK LEAVE OR VACATION AND NOW BECAUSE OF THEIR OWN LEAVE UNDER THIS LAW ANY ERROR IN APPLYING MATTER DISPUTE AS TO HOW MUCH AN EMPLOYEE WOULD BE- IT IS SUBJECT POSSIBLE PENALTIES. AND FINALLY WE HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT LIABILITY PENALTIES UNDER THE LABOR CODE ANY EMPLOYEE OR FORMER EMPLOYEE WHO BELIEVE THEY ARE NOW- TO RETROACTIVE PAYMENT COULD ALSO ARGUE THESE TRIGGERS PENALTIES UNDER THE LABOR CODE WHEN WE REQUESTED THAT THE BILL SPECIFICALLY SAY THAT EMPLOYER COULD NOT BE PENALIZED BASED ON THE RETROACTIVE NATURE THE BELT THAT REQUEST WAS DENIED. CALIFORNIA ALREADY LEADS THE NATION IN COVER NINETEEN RELATED EMPLOYMENT LAW IT'S AN EMPLOYER SIMPLY CANNOT TAKE WORK FINANCIAL HARDSHIP FOR THAT REASON WE RESPECTFULLY. OPPOSE SB NINETY FIVE.
