00:26:01.826 --> 00:26:03.929
DISTINCTION TO MAKE. THE WORK

AROUND NEW CONSTRUCTION IS THE

00:26:05.697 --> 00:26:06.531

FROM MY TWO THOUSAND NINE NANCY

00:30:20.218 --> 00:30:21.586
SKINNER- WHEN SHE WAS IN THE

00:30:21.653 --> 00:30:24.455
ASSEMBLY AB TWO SEVEN FIFTY

00:30:24.522 --> 00:30:24.956
EIGHT WE'VE GOT SEVERAL

00:30:25.023 --> 00:30:26.524
ITERATIONS OF THAT REPORTER

00:30:26.591 --> 00:30:28.126
THAT PLAN WHICH IS AN EXISTING

00:30:28.193 --> 00:30:29.861
BUILDING ENERGY EFFICIENCY

00:30:29.928 --> 00:30:31.296
STRATEGY FOR THE STATE SO THAT

00:30:31.362 --> 00:30:34.732
ALSO EXISTS WE'VE BEEN DRAWN ON

00:30:34.799 --> 00:30:36.868
THAT. AS WELL SO BUILDINGS AND

00:30:36.935 --> 00:30:37.936
BUILDING EMISSIONS AND ENERGY

00:30:38.002 --> 00:30:40.605
EFFICIENCY R. G. COMPLIMENTS

00:30:40.672 --> 00:30:41.606
KEY COMPONENTS TO THIS

00:30:41.673 --> 00:30:43.641
PROGRESS- AS YOU BOTH SAID

00:30:43.708 --> 00:30:45.977
SYSTEM OUR BUILDINGS EMISSIONS

00:30:46.044 --> 00:30:46.978
ARE 25% OF THE TOTAL IN THE

00:30:47.045 --> 00:30:49.948
STATE. OF THOSE A LITTLE LESS

00:30:50.014 --> 00:30:51.649
THAN HALF FOR DIRECT EMISSIONS

00:30:51.716 --> 00:30:52.784
AND SO THAT IS ONSITE

00:30:52.850 --> 00:30:54.452
COMBUSTION AND REFRIGERANTS

00:30:54.519 --> 00:30:56.020
THERE A MINUTE AFTER AT EACH

00:30:56.087 --> 00:30:57.722
BUILDING SO WE'VE LOOKED AT-

00:30:57.789 --> 00:30:59.524
THE LEGISLATION SUGGEST BOTH OF

00:30:59.591 --> 00:31:01.426
THOSE AS ORGANIZING PRINCIPLES

00:31:01.492 --> 00:31:02.794
WE LOOK AT MOST OF BOTH OF

00:31:02.860 --> 00:31:04.128
THOSE ASK BASED. ON THE

00:31:04.195 --> 00:31:07.532
DIFFERENCES ACTUALLY- IMPORTANT

00:31:07.599 --> 00:31:08.900
SO THAT ONE OF THE KEY

00:31:08.967 --> 00:31:10.268
TAKEAWAYS THAT ENERGY

00:31:10.335 --> 00:31:12.103
EFFICIENCY MAIN- CONTINUES TO

00:31:12.170 --> 00:31:14.072
BE CRUCIAL- IS A KEY GREENHOUSE

00:31:14.138 --> 00:31:16.040
GAS REDUCTION STRATEGY AND IT'S

00:31:16.107 --> 00:31:19.077
A STRATEGY TO. OPTIMIZE OUR OUR

00:31:19.143 --> 00:31:21.045
OVERALL STATEWIDE PATHWAY TO

00:31:21.112 --> 00:31:22.981
LOWER GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS.

00:31:23.047 --> 00:31:24.282
AND SECONDLY HIGHLY EFFICIENT

00:31:24.349 --> 00:31:25.783
ELECTRIC APPLIANCES IN

00:31:25.850 --> 00:31:28.086
PARTICULAR HE POPS ARE CRITICAL

00:31:28.152 --> 00:31:29.354
ESSENTIAL TO MEETING THE

00:31:29.420 --> 00:31:30.054
STATE'S CLEAN ENERGY AND

00:31:30.121 --> 00:31:32.357
CHRONICLES. LEVERAGING THE FACT

00:31:32.423 --> 00:31:33.224
THAT THE ELECTRIC SYSTEM IS

00:31:33.291 --> 00:31:35.026
ALREADY RAPIDLY DECARBONIZING

00:31:35.093 --> 00:31:36.694
AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO IN

00:31:36.761 --> 00:31:39.564
COMPLIANCE WITH OUR OUR PS AND

00:31:39.631 --> 00:31:41.165
SB ONE HUNDRED GOALS SO I'LL

00:31:41.232 --> 00:31:42.700
JUST GO OVER SOME CONCLUSIONS

00:31:42.767 --> 00:31:46.671
OF THE ASSESSMENT HERE- THE DO

00:31:46.738 --> 00:31:48.773
WE REALLY THINK IT'S- I'M SORRY

00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:52.510
THIS IS A- SORRY THIS HE'S GOT

00:31:52.577 --> 00:31:53.711
MIXED UP SOMEWHERE I'M NOT SURE

00:31:53.778 --> 00:31:56.114
HOW THAT HAPPENED BUT SORRY I

00:31:56.180 --> 00:31:57.815
MUST HAVE PUT AN END TO THEIR

00:31:57.882 --> 00:31:59.484
BY ACCIDENT SORRY ABOUT THAT NO

00:31:59.550 --> 00:32:04.756
PRO- YEP. OKAY AREA SO WE HAD

00:32:04.822 --> 00:32:07.091
AN THE REPORT ANALYZES SEVEN

00:32:07.158 --> 00:32:08.459
BROAD STRATEGIES SO

00:32:08.526 --> 00:32:09.727
ELECTRIFICATION IS REALLY

00:32:09.794 --> 00:32:10.995
PRINCIPLE AMONG THEM AND YOU'LL

00:32:11.062 --> 00:32:11.996
HEAR MORE ABOUT THAT FROM THE

00:32:12.063 --> 00:32:13.398
OTHER SPEAKERS FOR SURE.

00:32:13.464 --> 00:32:14.532
DECARBONISING ELECTRICITY

00:32:14.599 --> 00:32:15.800
GENERATIONS MENTIONED THAT

00:32:15.867 --> 00:32:17.402
ALREADY IT'S CRITICAL.

00:32:17.468 --> 00:32:18.670
DISTRIBUTED ENERGY RESOURCES

00:32:18.736 --> 00:32:21.906
CAN PROVIDE ADDITIONAL.

00:32:21.973 --> 00:32:23.675
REDUCTIONS IN GREENHOUSE GAS- A

00:32:23.741 --> 00:32:25.643
LOT OF THAT BUILDING CODES AND

00:32:25.710 --> 00:32:26.978
THERE ARE LOTS OF STATE

00:32:27.045 --> 00:32:28.579
PROGRAMS AND BEEN A PLACE FOR

00:32:28.646 --> 00:32:30.114
SOME TIME ON THAT FRONT.

00:32:30.181 --> 00:32:32.317
REFRIGERANT CONVERSION OVER TO

00:32:32.383 --> 00:32:34.252
LOWER GWP GREEN GLOBAL WARMING

00:32:34.319 --> 00:32:35.720
POTENTIAL FOR DRESS AND

00:32:35.787 --> 00:32:36.754
REDUCING LEAKAGE OF

00:32:36.821 --> 00:32:38.423
REFRIGERANTS IS ALSO A KEY

00:32:38.489 --> 00:32:40.892
STRATEGY AND WE ASSESS THE BAT

00:32:40.958 --> 00:32:42.660
IN THE REPORT AN INTEGRAL WAY.

00:32:42.727 --> 00:32:44.595
ENERGY EFFICIENCY AS A-

00:32:44.662 --> 00:32:45.596
CONTINUES TO BE RIGHT THERE AT

00:32:45.663 --> 00:32:46.431
THE TOP OF THE LOADING ORDER

00:32:46.497 --> 00:32:51.369
AND IT'S. ALSO JUST JOB ONE

00:32:51.436 --> 00:32:51.936
ACROSS THE ECONOMY WE S. THE

00:32:52.003 --> 00:32:54.339
MAN FLEX AS A STRAY TO USE THE

00:32:54.405 --> 00:32:56.741
CLEAN CLEAR MOLECULES AND CLEAN

00:32:56.808 --> 00:32:58.543
CLEAN ELECTRONS PARTICULAR WHEN

00:32:58.609 --> 00:32:59.844
THEY ARE AVAILABLE IN THE

00:32:59.911 --> 00:33:01.779
BRIDGE YEAH AND- TRY TO AVOID

00:33:01.846 --> 00:33:03.381
USING THE HIGHER CARBON

00:33:03.448 --> 00:33:06.884
ELECTRONS. SO THAT TIME IT IS

00:33:06.951 --> 00:33:08.486
REALLY IMPORTANT AND INCREASING

00:33:08.553 --> 00:33:09.687
IMPORTANCE TO UNDERPIN OUR

00:33:09.754 --> 00:33:11.255
RELIABILITY OF OUR GREAT IN THE

00:33:11.322 --> 00:33:12.690
STATE AND IS A KEY STRATEGY

00:33:12.757 --> 00:33:14.859
PRETTY CARBONIZATION AS WELL.

00:33:14.926 --> 00:33:15.727
AND THE GOVERNOR'S IN THE GAS

00:33:15.793 --> 00:33:17.195
SYSTEM YOU'LL HEAR SOME ABOUT

00:33:17.261 --> 00:33:20.231
AS WELL WE CAN'T SUBSTITUTE

00:33:20.298 --> 00:33:21.966
SOME OF THOSE MOLECULES SO

00:33:22.033 --> 00:33:23.434
EQUITY WE JUST HAVE TO FOCUS ON

00:33:23.501 --> 00:33:24.769
EQUITY AND HAS TO BE A

00:33:24.836 --> 00:33:25.937
FOUNDATION I'LL TALK ABOUT IT'S

00:33:26.003 --> 00:33:27.572
JUST VERY VERY BRIEFLY ABOUT.

00:33:27.638 --> 00:33:28.706
WHAT THAT MEANS BUT OUR

00:33:28.773 --> 00:33:30.141
PROGRAMS REALLY NEED TO FOCUS

00:33:30.208 --> 00:33:31.809
ON THE FOLKS WHO CAN'T AFFORD

00:33:31.876 --> 00:33:34.545
THE INVESTMENTS THAT WE WILL-

00:33:34.612 --> 00:33:37.281
THAT WILL BE- SUGGESTING AND-

00:33:37.348 --> 00:33:39.083
WE- CAN'T CONVERT THE PROGRAM.

00:33:39.150 --> 00:33:40.718
APPROACH TO START WITH UNDER

00:33:40.785 --> 00:33:41.919
RESOURCE COMMUNITIES AND

00:33:41.986 --> 00:33:43.121
ENCOURAGE THE MARKET TO SCALE

00:33:43.187 --> 00:33:44.989
UP FROM THERE I THINK THAT'S A-

00:33:45.056 --> 00:33:46.824
THAT THAT'S REALLY CRITICAL TO

00:33:46.891 --> 00:33:47.425
GET THE TECHNOLOGIES AT SCALE

00:33:47.492 --> 00:33:49.527
QUICKLY. IN THE SECTORS THAT

00:33:49.594 --> 00:33:51.562
CAN LEAST AFFORD THEM AND USE

00:33:51.629 --> 00:33:52.196
THAT AS A MARKET TRANSFORMATION

00:33:52.263 --> 00:33:53.798
STRATEGY. A DIRECT COMMUNITY

00:33:53.865 --> 00:33:55.900
ENGAGEMENT CANNOT EMPHASIZE THE

00:33:55.967 --> 00:33:57.301
NEED TO WORK THROUGH COMMUNITY

00:33:57.368 --> 00:33:58.503
BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND LOCAL

00:33:58.569 --> 00:34:00.171
GOVERNMENTS TO HELP THIS HAPPEN

00:34:00.238 --> 00:34:02.073
ACROSS THE STATE. AND THEN

00:34:02.140 --> 00:34:03.141
PROGRAM AND FINANCIAL

00:34:03.207 --> 00:34:05.476
MECHANISMS TO HELP MAKE ALL

00:34:05.543 --> 00:34:06.944
THIS HAPPEN. WE WILL NOT REACH

00:34:07.011 --> 00:34:09.814
OUR CLIMATE GOALS UNLESS WE

00:34:09.881 --> 00:34:10.381
LOOK AT IT THROUGH AN EQUITY

00:34:10.448 --> 00:34:12.483
LENS THAT'S A KEY TECHNOLOGIES

00:34:12.550 --> 00:34:13.584
HIGHLY EFFICIENT ELECTRIC

00:34:13.651 --> 00:34:14.786
APPLIANCES WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

00:34:14.852 --> 00:34:16.087
HE PUMPS FOR WATER AND SPACE

00:34:16.154 --> 00:34:18.089
HEATING INDUCTION STOVES.

00:34:18.156 --> 00:34:19.123
THAT'S NOT PART OF THE BUILDING

00:34:19.190 --> 00:34:20.758
CODE BUT IT'S ALSO A KEY.

00:34:20.825 --> 00:34:22.560
ENABLER IN SOME CASES WE'RE

00:34:22.627 --> 00:34:24.162
HERE WHERE WE'RE SEEING ACT TO-

00:34:24.228 --> 00:34:26.030
FULL EXPLICATION. AND ELECTRIC

00:34:26.097 --> 00:34:27.632
CLOTHES DRYER SIDEKICK OR HEAT

00:34:27.698 --> 00:34:28.599
PUMP CLOTHES DRIERS ARE NOT

00:34:28.666 --> 00:34:29.367
QUITE THERE YET BUT THEY'RE

00:34:29.434 --> 00:34:30.668
GETTING THERE. WILL BE A

00:34:30.735 --> 00:34:32.904
SOLUTION IN THE FUTURE- WE HAVE

00:34:32.970 --> 00:34:34.372
TO WORRY ABOUT THE PANELING THE

00:34:34.439 --> 00:34:36.741
PANELS AND WIRING. EXISTING

00:34:36.808 --> 00:34:37.642
BUILDINGS THAT UPGRADE COST IS

00:34:37.708 --> 00:34:40.044
NOT TRIVIAL- AND SOLAR IT WITH

00:34:40.111 --> 00:34:42.046
STORAGE NOW TO IMPROVE ITS

00:34:42.113 --> 00:34:42.980
FLEXIBILITY AND ITS

00:34:43.047 --> 00:34:45.249
DECARBONISATION ACT. IS ALSO AN

00:34:45.316 --> 00:34:47.084
ONGOING STRATEGY INCREASINGLY

00:34:47.151 --> 00:34:48.119
WITH STORAGE AVAILABLE IN THE

00:34:48.186 --> 00:34:51.589
MARKET. AND IT LOOKS LIKE

00:34:51.656 --> 00:34:52.657
STABILITY AS I SAID FINANCING

00:34:52.723 --> 00:34:55.259
MODELS WE DID THE NUMBERS ON

00:34:55.326 --> 00:34:57.028
HOW MUCH HOW MUCH MONEY

00:34:57.094 --> 00:34:58.496
ESSENTIALLY IT'S GOING TO COST

00:34:58.563 --> 00:34:59.530
TO UPGRADE THE EXISTING

00:34:59.597 --> 00:35:00.565
BUILDING STOCK ACROSS THE STATE

00:35:00.631 --> 00:35:02.533
WERE TALKING. IN THE ORDER OF

00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:03.034
THIRTY TO FORTY BILLION

00:35:03.100 --> 00:35:05.837
DOLLARS. OVER THE COURSE OF.

00:35:05.903 --> 00:35:07.271
THE NEXT TWENTY YEARS OR SO

00:35:07.338 --> 00:35:08.439
THAT'S A SUSTAIN INVESTMENT

00:35:08.506 --> 00:35:09.974
THAT WE NEED WE'RE NOT

00:35:10.041 --> 00:35:11.576
SUGGESTING THAT. THE THE BILL

00:35:11.642 --> 00:35:13.277
JUST ASSESSMENT RIGHT IT'S NOT

00:35:13.344 --> 00:35:14.445
IT'S NOT A RECOMMENDATION BUT I

00:35:14.512 --> 00:35:16.414
THINK THE- IDEA THERE WOULD BE

00:35:16.481 --> 00:35:17.181
THAT WE HAVE TO LEVERAGE

00:35:17.248 --> 00:35:19.083
PRIVATE INVESTMENT AND REALLY

00:35:19.150 --> 00:35:20.218
DO THAT HANDSHAKE BUT PUBLIC

00:35:20.284 --> 00:35:21.252
PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS AND FIGURE

00:35:21.319 --> 00:35:22.820
OUT WAYS. TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN

00:35:22.887 --> 00:35:24.489
IN PARTICULAR FOR LOW INCOME

00:35:24.555 --> 00:35:26.958
AND RENTERS. WORKING WITH THOSE

00:35:27.024 --> 00:35:27.458
SECTORS DIRECTLY TO FIND

00:35:27.525 --> 00:35:29.093
SOLUTIONS FOR THEM. ONE

00:35:29.160 --> 00:35:30.228
SOLUTION IS TERRACED ON BILL

00:35:30.294 --> 00:35:32.530
FINANCING WHICH IS A REALLY

00:35:32.597 --> 00:35:33.831
PRACTICAL SOLUTION THAT HELPS

00:35:33.898 --> 00:35:36.234
NEWS OFF BALANCE SHEET. CAPITAL

00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:37.301
BUT GETS THE RECOVERY ON THE

00:35:37.368 --> 00:35:41.472
UTILITY BILL. SO THAT'S A

00:35:41.539 --> 00:35:42.039
THAT'S A PROMISING SOLUTION

00:35:42.106 --> 00:35:43.040
HAVING SOME ARE TRACK NOW IN IN

00:35:43.107 --> 00:35:45.743
L. YEAH AND WE REALLY AS I SAID

00:35:45.810 --> 00:35:46.811
NEED TO FOCUS ON PUBLIC PRIVATE

00:35:46.878 --> 00:35:48.813
PARTNERSHIPS. SO I'M GONNA SHOW

00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:51.282
COUPLE PICTURES- BASICALLY THE

00:35:51.349 --> 00:35:52.416
TO THE IF YOU LOOK AT THE

00:35:52.483 --> 00:35:54.252
BOTTOM LINE THAT'S THE ONSITE

00:35:54.318 --> 00:35:56.654
EMISSIONS REDUCTION. GOAL OF

00:35:56.721 --> 00:35:58.089
40% BELOW NINETEEN NINETY

00:35:58.155 --> 00:35:59.223
LEVELS. AND IT REALLY ONLY OR

00:35:59.290 --> 00:36:02.226
TO- SCENARIOS TO PASSWORD

00:36:02.293 --> 00:36:03.794
STRATEGIES TO GET US THERE THE

00:36:03.861 --> 00:36:07.098
AGGRESSIVE ELECTRIFICATION AND

00:36:07.164 --> 00:36:07.532
EFFICIENT AGGRESSIVE

00:36:07.598 --> 00:36:08.866
ELECTRIFICATION WASTE THE

00:36:08.933 --> 00:36:10.501
LITTLE OF THE LIGHTER COLOR AT

00:36:10.568 --> 00:36:12.970
THE TOP IS THE REFRIGERANTS

00:36:13.037 --> 00:36:14.872
THAT ALSO NEED A SOLUTION TO

00:36:14.939 --> 00:36:15.540
LOWER THEIR GLOBAL WARMING

00:36:15.606 --> 00:36:17.842
POTENTIAL- BUT THOSE TWO- AND

00:36:17.909 --> 00:36:19.010
ALL THE STRATEGIES THAT ARE

00:36:19.076 --> 00:36:20.378
LISTED ARE THE TWO THAT REALLY

00:36:20.444 --> 00:36:22.346
GET US WHERE. TO GO TERMS OF

00:36:22.413 --> 00:36:24.015
REDUCING BUILDING RELATED

00:36:24.081 --> 00:36:26.851
EMISSIONS BOTH ONSITE AND

00:36:26.918 --> 00:36:28.486
SYSTEM WIDE AND THEN THIS ONE

00:36:28.553 --> 00:36:30.488
IS THE SAME SCENARIOS- AND IT

00:36:30.555 --> 00:36:31.956
LOOKS AT THE COST PER TIME IS

00:36:32.023 --> 00:36:34.458
THE RED LINE. AND THE SQUARES

00:36:34.525 --> 00:36:36.761
AND THEN THE OVERALL COSTS AND

00:36:36.827 --> 00:36:37.495
YOU KNOW YOU CAN SEE THOSE TWO

00:36:37.562 --> 00:36:39.697
SCENARIOS. HAVE A COST PER TON

00:36:39.764 --> 00:36:41.232
OF CARBON REDUCTIONS OF ABOUT A

00:36:41.299 --> 00:36:42.366
HUNDRED FORTY DOLLARS IN THE

00:36:42.433 --> 00:36:43.568
MID THIRTIES HIGH THIRTIES IN

00:36:43.634 --> 00:36:46.103
TERMS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF

00:36:46.170 --> 00:36:46.637
INVESTMENT NEEDED. TO MAKE

00:36:46.704 --> 00:36:48.105
THOSE HAPPEN HI ENERGY

00:36:48.172 --> 00:36:50.675
EFFICIENCY IS A NEGATIVE COST

00:36:50.741 --> 00:36:51.275
IT STILL WORKS REALLY WELL BUT

00:36:51.342 --> 00:36:52.209
THE SCALE OF IT PRETTY

00:36:52.276 --> 00:36:53.711
CARBONIZATION IS JUST NOT GONNA

00:36:53.778 --> 00:36:54.645
GET US THERE SO WE SHOULD DO

00:36:54.712 --> 00:36:57.582
THAT. BUT WE DO NEED TO FOCUS

00:36:57.648 --> 00:36:59.450
ON. FUEL SUBSTITUTION WITH

00:36:59.517 --> 00:37:02.486
CLEAN ELECTRICITY WHEREVER

00:37:02.553 --> 00:37:04.055
POSSIBLE SO EXISTING BUILDINGS

00:37:04.121 --> 00:37:05.823
THERE- LIST OF CHALLENGES HERE.

00:37:05.890 --> 00:37:07.158
THE TIMING CONSUMER

00:37:07.224 --> 00:37:09.226
FAMILIARITY. CAPITALS I

00:37:09.293 --> 00:37:11.829
MENTIONED. SOME SUPPLY CHAIN

00:37:11.896 --> 00:37:12.930
ISSUES PERHAPS THOSE ARE THOSE

00:37:12.997 --> 00:37:15.132
WILL GET WORKED OUT- AND

00:37:15.199 --> 00:37:17.902
ELECTRICITY AND NATURAL GAS

00:37:17.969 --> 00:37:18.436
RATES WANT TO SURE INSURE

00:37:18.502 --> 00:37:20.237
REALLY YOU SHOULD SEE SOME OF

00:37:20.304 --> 00:37:21.872
THE BENEFIT IS THERE FOR RIGHT

00:37:21.939 --> 00:37:26.444
THE CUSTOMER- SO- WITH THAT

00:37:26.510 --> 00:37:28.212
SEAT SO HERE THE CONCLUSIONS-

00:37:28.279 --> 00:37:28.946
SO WE NEED A LARGE SCALE

00:37:29.013 --> 00:37:31.315
DEPLOYMENT LIKE. THIS NEARLY

00:37:31.382 --> 00:37:32.850
CONSTRUCTION NEWLY CONSTRUCTED

00:37:32.917 --> 00:37:33.951
BUILDINGS IF YOU SUGGESTED YOUR

00:37:34.018 --> 00:37:36.354
HOLDEN HAVE THE LOWEST COST IN

00:37:36.420 --> 00:37:37.521
ARE REALLY SORT OF THE EASIER

00:37:37.588 --> 00:37:39.724
PART A PROBLEM. MAKING WILL

00:37:39.790 --> 00:37:42.226
CONTINUE TO ADVANCE THAT FRONT-

00:37:42.293 --> 00:37:44.929
SO EFFICIENCY AND PROVEN

00:37:44.996 --> 00:37:46.530
ABILITY CLOSE ALIGNMENT WITH

00:37:46.597 --> 00:37:47.498
THE CONVERSATION AND WILL

00:37:47.565 --> 00:37:49.700
CONTINUE TO BE SO. LARGE

00:37:49.767 --> 00:37:50.635
INVESTMENTS IN THE EXISTING

00:37:50.701 --> 00:37:53.037
BUILDINGS ARE NEEDED- AND

00:37:53.104 --> 00:37:54.839
FURTHER LONG TERM. RELIABILITY

00:37:54.905 --> 00:37:56.941
IMPACTS AS WELL NEED ASSESSING

00:37:57.008 --> 00:37:58.476
ARE BOTH ON THE GAS SIDE AND

00:37:58.542 --> 00:38:03.748
SIDE. THE BILL ASKS US TO DO.

00:38:03.814 --> 00:38:04.315
THAT WE BEGIN THAT WORK WITH

00:38:04.382 --> 00:38:04.849
THAT WILL CONTINUE NUMBER

00:38:04.915 --> 00:38:06.651
CERTAINLY CAN IS A KEY PART OF

00:38:06.717 --> 00:38:08.386
THIS A AS WELL AND THEN THE GAS

00:38:08.452 --> 00:38:09.887
SYSTEM ROLE ANY INCENTIVES NEED

00:38:09.954 --> 00:38:11.155
FURTHER REVIEWSUPPER GONNA

00:38:11.222 --> 00:38:13.090
REALLY SHIFT. FROM ONE FIELD TO

00:38:13.157 --> 00:38:15.893
ANOTHER WE HAVE TO CAREFULLY

00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:17.561
PLAN THAT OVER TIME SOME ABOUT

00:38:17.628 --> 00:38:19.497
SOMETHING ABOUT THAT. WOULD

00:38:19.563 --> 00:38:20.731
PROBABLY OTHERS SPEAKERS AS

00:38:20.798 --> 00:38:22.566
WELL AND PERHAPS THE DISCUSSION

00:38:22.633 --> 00:38:25.302
SO EQUITY IS CRITICAL-

00:38:25.369 --> 00:38:26.871
COLLABORATION A CAN'T EMPHASIZE

00:38:26.937 --> 00:38:28.406

HIGHLIGHTINGWHY- YOU KNOW

00:41:49.940 --> 00:41:50.708
BUILDING DECARBONIZATION IS A

00:41:50.774 --> 00:41:54.044
CRITICAL PIECE- L. THE FOLKS

00:41:54.111 --> 00:41:55.746
ALREADY HIGHLIGHTED THAT THAT

00:41:55.813 --> 00:41:57.081
DIRE SITUATION WHEN IT COMES TO

00:41:57.147 --> 00:41:58.749
WILDFIRES RIGHT BUT WHEN YOU

00:41:58.816 --> 00:41:59.350

00:41:59.416 --> 00:42:01.185
LOT OF PROJECTS. TO MAKE THINGS

00:42:01.252 --> 00:42:02.586
BETTER BUT ONE THING WHERE WE

00:42:02.653 --> 00:42:04.755
THINK BUILDING ELECTRIFICATION-

00:42:04.822 --> 00:42:06.357
AND SPECIFIC SPECIFICALLY HEAT

00:42:06.423 --> 00:42:08.158
PUMPS FOR SPACE HEATING. IS WE

00:42:08.225 --> 00:42:10.027
CAN ENSURE THAT FOLKS GET

WEATHER RIGHTS. LEAD VISION

00:42:11.862 --> 00:42:13.764
POLLUTION FREE HOME RIGHT. IF

00:42:13.831 --> 00:42:14.765
YOU INSTALL HEAT PUMP WITH

00:42:14.832 --> 00:42:16.734
ILLUSTRATION. THEN THAT'S ONE

00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:17.668
WAY TO ENSURE THAT FOLKS

00:42:17.735 --> 00:42:18.535

EXTREME HEAT AND AGAIN RIGHT IN

00:42:42.092 --> 00:42:42.960
THE PATH WICKS BUILDING

00:42:43.027 --> 00:42:44.662
LOCATION WE CAN KEEP UP SPACE

00:42:44.728 --> 00:42:46.830

00:49:35.939 --> 00:49:37.774
SCHOOL ESPECIALLY THOSE WITH

00:49:37.841 --> 00:49:39.776
LOW INCOME RESIDENTS HOMES AND

00:49:39.843 --> 00:49:40.911
REALLY ALLOWING AFFORDABLE

00:49:40.977 --> 00:49:42.112
HOUSING PROVIDERS TO MAKE

00:49:42.179 --> 00:49:45.782
ELECTRIFICATION OF UPGRADES BY

00:49:45.849 --> 00:49:48.151
TREATING IT AS A PUBLIC BENEFIT

00:49:48.218 --> 00:49:49.619
SO IT IS JUST ENSURING THAT WE

00:49:49.686 --> 00:49:52.422
HAVE ELECTRIFICATION FRIENDLY

00:49:52.489 --> 00:49:53.323

CONCLUSION I JUST WANT TO SAY

00:49:59.629 --> 00:50:01.932
THAT HEALTHY RECIPE AND ARMS

00:50:01.998 --> 00:50:04.434

00:50:04.501 --> 00:50:06.036
NOT FOR THE CONTACT WE HAVE

00:50:06.103 --> 00:50:07.771
KNOCKED WITH. THE ECONOMIC

00:50:11.208 --> 00:50:13.210
BY LOWER INCOME CALIFORNIANS WE

00:50:13.276 --> 00:50:13.677
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

00:50:13.744 --> 00:50:14.578
AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS

00:50:14.644 --> 00:50:16.012
PRIORITISED AS A MEANS TO

00:50:16.079 --> 00:50:17.447
EQUITABLY ELECTRIFYING OF

00:50:19.282 --> 00:50:21.151
EQUITABLE ALLOCATION POLICY.

00:50:21.218 --> 00:50:22.219

HEAT PUMP WATER HEATERS WHILE

00:55:55.785 --> 00:55:57.787
ARE VERY INNOVATIVE AND

00:55:57.854 --> 00:55:59.456
CERTAINLY THE MOST EFFICIENT

00:55:59.522 --> 00:56:01.558
WAY TO KEEP WATER. THEY'RE

00:56:01.624 --> 00:56:03.860
STILL IN TECHNOLOGY. AND JUST

00:56:03.927 --> 00:56:06.162
TO GIVE THE COMMITTEE A SCALE.

00:56:06.229 --> 00:56:06.996
EIGHT MILLION WATER HEATERS

BASE 90% OF THOSE ARE GAS

00:56:21.778 --> 00:56:23.747
FIRED. SO WE'RE LOOKING AT NINE

00:56:23.813 --> 00:56:25.248
BILLION WATER HEATERS TO

00:56:25.315 --> 00:56:26.483
CONVERT IN THE STATE OF

HEATERS BEING MANUFACTURED

00:56:30.720 --> 00:56:32.455
ANNUALLY YOU CAN SEE THERE'S A

00:56:32.522 --> 00:56:33.556
DELTA THERE THAT NEEDS TO BE

WAY THESE THAT THINK IT'S VERY

01:00:04.300 --> 01:00:06.069
IMPORTANT SLIDE THAT FRAME THE

01:00:06.135 --> 01:00:06.803
CONVERSATION ABOUT

01:00:06.869 --> 01:00:08.404
DECARBONIZATION IN THE TERMS

01:00:08.471 --> 01:00:12.408
THAT WE NEED TO DISCUSS SIMILAR

01:00:12.475 --> 01:00:13.276
TO A COMPLEX. OUR OBJECTIVE AND

01:00:13.343 --> 01:00:14.110
I'D LIKE TO DIRECT YOUR

CHARGES THE SUMMER ANALYSIS

01:00:20.083 --> 01:00:22.986
THAT ASKS THE QUESTION. WHAT T

01:00:23.052 --> 01:00:25.688
WILL TAKE FOR US. ON A GLOBAL

01:00:25.755 --> 01:00:28.458
SCALE. TO REACH THE GOAL OF

01:00:28.524 --> 01:00:30.960
LIMITING GLOBAL WARMING HAVE

01:00:31.027 --> 01:00:33.363
DEGREES AND THE CONCLUSION THAT

BLOOMBERG NEW ENERGY FINANCE.

01:00:37.100 --> 01:00:39.969
REACHED WAS THAT AS YOU CAN SEE

01:00:40.036 --> 01:00:41.070
ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE THE

01:00:41.137 --> 01:00:42.572
CONTRIBUTION OF BALLOT TRUMP'S

01:00:42.638 --> 01:00:44.874
OF MOLECULES. TO THE ENERGY

01:00:44.941 --> 01:00:49.312
MAKES IS ABOUT EQUAL BETTER

01:00:49.379 --> 01:00:50.113
BELIEVE IS VERY IMPORTANT TO

01:00:50.179 --> 01:00:51.180
KEEP THEM ALL BECAUSE I KNOW

01:00:51.247 --> 01:00:52.815
THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

01:00:52.882 --> 01:00:54.784
HAS SPENT A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT

01:00:54.851 --> 01:00:55.685
OF EFFORT BEEN ACCOMPLISHED A

01:00:55.752 --> 01:00:58.488
LOT. IN ADVANCE OF A GENDER

01:00:58.554 --> 01:01:01.157
OFTEN ALCOHOLS I BELIEVE THE

01:01:01.224 --> 01:01:02.725
FOR US TO BE SUCCESSFUL

01:01:02.792 --> 01:01:04.927
DEVELOPMENT SOLUTIONS THAT NOT

01:01:04.994 --> 01:01:06.763
ONLY LAW CALIFORNIANS REGION'S

01:01:06.829 --> 01:01:08.498
GOALS BUT THE ULTIMATE

01:01:08.564 --> 01:01:11.200
ULTIMATELY SERVE AS THE EXAMPLE

01:01:11.267 --> 01:01:13.069
OF THE MODEL AS A TEMPLATE FOR

01:01:13.136 --> 01:01:15.338
THE WORLD. WE NEED TO ADVANCE

01:01:15.405 --> 01:01:17.173
OUR ADOPTION OF THE MOLECULES

01:01:17.240 --> 01:01:18.808
AS VIGOROUSLY AS WE HAVE

01:01:18.875 --> 01:01:24.080
ADVANCED. PROBLEMS OF THESE

01:01:24.147 --> 01:01:26.582
SMALLER THIS IS FAIRLY BROAD

01:01:26.649 --> 01:01:29.085
SET OF THIS YEAR EMISSION AND

01:01:29.152 --> 01:01:31.587
THANK WILL NATURAL GAS FIVE.

01:01:31.654 --> 01:01:33.956
AND HYDROGEN THE BED BLACKBOOK

01:01:34.023 --> 01:01:35.058
THE BOTTLE OF WATER BOND IN

01:01:35.124 --> 01:01:37.827
SPECIFICALLY HYDROGEN. EXACTLY

01:01:37.894 --> 01:01:41.631
IS BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING

01:01:41.697 --> 01:01:42.999
THAT I THINK- YEAH WE CAN TAKE

01:01:43.066 --> 01:01:46.669
AWAY ASHRAMS BETH ALSO GREEN

01:01:46.736 --> 01:01:49.739
HYDROGEN UP OYSTER RAP OF THE

01:01:49.806 --> 01:01:51.207
CHART IN FRONT OF YOU IS NOT A

01:01:51.274 --> 01:01:52.675
FORECAST IT'S VERY ALLOCATE

01:01:52.742 --> 01:01:54.444
WHAT HAPPENS WHAT HAPPENED WITH

01:01:54.510 --> 01:01:56.646
THE RENEWABLE POWER PRICES IN

01:01:56.712 --> 01:01:57.713
CALIFORNIA OVER THE LAST

01:01:57.780 --> 01:02:00.349
DECADE. IT'S REMARKABLE THAT

01:02:00.416 --> 01:02:02.318
THEY DECLINE A FULL ORDER OF

01:02:02.385 --> 01:02:04.153
MAGNITUDE IN THE SPACE OF ABOUT

01:02:04.220 --> 01:02:06.489
DECADES. AND THAT IS THE SINGLE

01:02:06.556 --> 01:02:07.890
BIGGEST COMPONENT OF PASTA

01:02:07.957 --> 01:02:09.358
GREAT PACKAGE WAS AGREED

01:02:09.425 --> 01:02:12.261
HYDROGEN IS. IS TAKEN WATER AND

01:02:12.328 --> 01:02:14.263
USING POWER INCREASINGLY

01:02:14.330 --> 01:02:15.865
RENEWABLE POWER TO PRODUCE

01:02:15.932 --> 01:02:18.167
HYDROGEN SO AS RENEWABLE POWER

01:02:18.234 --> 01:02:20.570
PRICES DECLINE. SO DOES THE

01:02:20.636 --> 01:02:22.371
COST OF REPACKAGING MAKE IT

01:02:22.438 --> 01:02:25.675
AFFORDABLE FUEL. THANKS BYE

01:02:25.741 --> 01:02:28.644
WHICH IMPORTANT ELEMENT IN THIS

01:02:28.711 --> 01:02:31.280
LIGHT IS THAT- GREEN HYDROGEN

01:02:31.347 --> 01:02:33.015
CAN BE USED FOR YOU CAPITALIZE

01:02:33.082 --> 01:02:35.051
MULTIPLE SECTORS. AND AGAIN I

SLIDE YOU SEE ALL THE SECTORS

01:02:39.789 --> 01:02:40.756
BUT PRIVATE TREATMENT BE

01:02:40.823 --> 01:02:42.859
APPLICABLE IT IS THE PARALYZING

TRANSPORTATION. ESPECIALLY

01:02:45.495 --> 01:02:47.263
HEAVY DUTY TRANSPORTATION WHERE

01:02:47.330 --> 01:02:50.533
FUEL CELL ELECTRIC VEHICLES ARE

01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:52.802
THAT SOLUTION OF CHOICE. IT CAN

01:02:52.869 --> 01:02:55.104
ALSO BE USED AND THEY ARE WHY

01:02:55.171 --> 01:02:56.906
OUR WEEKS FOR THE PURPOSE OF

01:02:56.973 --> 01:02:59.075
THIS CONVERSATION IT CAN BE

01:02:59.142 --> 01:03:00.977
USED FOR ANY PURPOSE BUILDINGS

AND I'LL SHARE WITH YOU LATER

01:03:02.245 --> 01:03:07.016
ON SOME OF THE WORK ON. THEIR

01:03:07.083 --> 01:03:07.750
WEIGHT. AND IN OUR STATE NEXT I

01:03:07.817 --> 01:03:12.255
PLEASE. AS I TRIED TO SUMMARIZE

01:03:12.321 --> 01:03:13.990
IN THIS LIVE AT LEAST FOLLOW

01:03:14.056 --> 01:03:15.558

01:04:50.920 --> 01:04:52.321
POTENTIAL HYDROGEN LAST

01:04:52.388 --> 01:04:54.924
BUILDINGS OR H. TWO HYDROGEN

01:04:54.991 --> 01:04:56.759
ALL LET'S GO TO NEXT SLIDE

01:04:56.826 --> 01:05:00.429
PLEASE SO THEY CAN TAKE AWAY AS

01:05:00.496 --> 01:05:01.998
I'D LIKE TO LEAVE YOU WITH IS

01:05:02.064 --> 01:05:03.399
THAT WE BELIEVE THAT THE

01:05:03.466 --> 01:05:05.134
COMBINATION APPROACH NEEDS TO

01:05:05.201 --> 01:05:06.769
BE HOLISTIC AND WHAT THAT MEANS

01:05:06.836 --> 01:05:08.237
IS THAT BASICALLY WAS A

01:05:08.304 --> 01:05:11.974
TREMENDOUS FOR ALL FOUR THREE

01:05:12.041 --> 01:05:12.608
SCHEME TO PROVIDE YOU BUILDINGS

01:05:12.675 --> 01:05:13.876
WE BELIEVE THERE'S A ROLE FOR

01:05:13.943 --> 01:05:15.544
US TRONG AND FROM ALL ANGLES

01:05:15.611 --> 01:05:17.580
IN. APPRECIATION FOR EXISTING

01:05:17.647 --> 01:05:19.915
BUILDING STOCK WE BELIEVE THIS

01:05:19.982 --> 01:05:21.250
POLICYMAKERS SUPPOSED TO CAN

01:05:21.317 --> 01:05:23.919
EVEN PLAY ADVANCED JAVA AND ONE

01:05:23.986 --> 01:05:25.388
GOAL TO USE THAT WOULD BE ARE

01:05:25.454 --> 01:05:27.223
YOU WILL GUESS THAT. WOULD

01:05:27.290 --> 01:05:30.459
INCORPORATE MULTIPLE CLEAN

01:05:30.526 --> 01:05:31.394
GUEST BATH WAYS AND THE LAST

01:05:31.460 --> 01:05:33.262
BUT NOT THE LEAST WE BELIEVE

01:05:33.329 --> 01:05:34.563
AND FEEL STRONGLY THAT

01:05:34.630 --> 01:05:36.332
CALIFORNIA NEEDS STATEWIDE I

01:05:36.399 --> 01:05:38.601
DIDN'T STRATEGIES. WHICH IS

01:05:38.668 --> 01:05:39.769
GOING TO BE INTEGRATED ACROSS

01:05:39.835 --> 01:05:41.804
THE VARIOUS SOURCES OF FIBER

01:05:41.871 --> 01:05:44.140
JIM VERY ISSUES. AND ONE

01:05:44.206 --> 01:05:45.308
EXAMPLE OF THAT APPROACH THAT'S

01:05:45.374 --> 01:05:47.343
NOT BEING ACTIVELY DISCUSSED AT

01:05:47.410 --> 01:05:48.711
THE FEDERAL LEVEL AS WELL AS

01:05:48.778 --> 01:05:50.980
HERE IN CALIFORNIA. IS A

01:05:51.047 --> 01:05:51.781
CONVERSATION ABOUT INDUSTRIAL

01:05:51.847 --> 01:05:57.286
HUBS WHICH ARE AT THE POTENTIAL.

01:05:57.353 --> 01:05:58.154
FOR A LOT OF HYDROGEN SCALE HIM

01:05:58.220 --> 01:06:01.257
TO MEETING CALIFORNIA THANK YOU

01:06:01.324 --> 01:06:03.059
VERY MUCH FOR ATTENTION THANK

01:06:03.125 --> 01:06:05.261
YOU MISS FRIEDMAN WE APPRECIATE

01:06:05.328 --> 01:06:07.463
YOUR PRESENTATION AND CLEARLY

01:06:07.530 --> 01:06:09.065
HYDROGEN IS PART OF A

01:06:09.131 --> 01:06:10.333
CONVERSATION AND WE LOOK

01:06:10.399 --> 01:06:11.500
FORWARD TO MAYBE HAVING SOME

01:06:11.567 --> 01:06:12.468
QUESTIONS THAT'LL BRING US

01:06:12.535 --> 01:06:15.204
BACK. INTO THAT TOPIC WITH YOU

01:06:15.271 --> 01:06:17.440
AND OTHERS FINALLY WE HAVE

01:06:17.506 --> 01:06:19.442
DOCTOR MICHAEL WERE A OF THE

01:06:19.508 --> 01:06:20.743
WOODS INSTITUTE AT STANFORD

01:06:20.810 --> 01:06:22.678
UNIVERSITY WHO WILL DISCUSS THE

01:06:22.745 --> 01:06:24.280
CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES AS

01:06:24.347 --> 01:06:25.981
THE STATE FACES THIS

01:06:26.048 --> 01:06:28.617
DECARBONIZATION TRANSITION

01:06:28.684 --> 01:06:31.420
WELCOME. DOCTOR WERE THANK YOU

01:06:31.487 --> 01:06:32.588
VERY MUCH YOU'RE HOLDEN AND

01:06:32.655 --> 01:06:34.123
SHERRY THAT'S FOR INVITING ME

01:06:34.190 --> 01:06:36.525
TO TESTIFY- BEFORE THIS HEARING

01:06:36.592 --> 01:06:39.362
TODAY. WE RECENTLY COMPLETED

01:06:39.428 --> 01:06:42.798
ANALYSIS- FOCUSED ON THE COSTS

01:06:42.865 --> 01:06:45.935
OF DIFFERENT PATHWAYS. TO

01:06:46.001 --> 01:06:48.404
DECARBONISATION OF RESIDENTIAL

01:06:48.471 --> 01:06:50.272
BUILDINGS AND MORE GENERALLY

01:06:50.339 --> 01:06:52.608
THE GASTRO FUSION SYSTEM IN

01:06:52.675 --> 01:06:54.143
CALIFORNIA AND I'M GONNA SHARE

01:06:54.210 --> 01:06:55.945
SOME INCLUSIONS FROM NETWORK

01:06:56.011 --> 01:06:57.747
AND MAYBE EXTEND A LITTLE BIT-

01:06:57.813 --> 01:07:02.752
UPON THEM TODAY- OUR ANALYSIS

01:07:02.818 --> 01:07:05.287
TARGETED- YOU KNOW QUESTIONS

01:07:05.354 --> 01:07:07.289
AROUND WHAT RATED PACKS

01:07:07.356 --> 01:07:10.726
DIFFERENT PATHWAYS TO. NATURAL

01:07:10.793 --> 01:07:14.163
GAS SYSTEM DECARBONISATION-

01:07:14.230 --> 01:07:16.565
MIGHT HAPPEN SO WE EVALUATED

01:07:16.632 --> 01:07:19.802
FOUR SCENARIOS- THE FIRST LOOK

01:07:19.869 --> 01:07:21.404
AT TITLE TWENTY FOUR AND

01:07:21.470 --> 01:07:22.605
FOCUSED ON NEW BUILDINGS I

01:07:22.671 --> 01:07:24.640
WON'T DISCUSS THAT TODAY BUT

01:07:24.707 --> 01:07:26.675
THE REMAINING THREE FOCUSED ON

01:07:26.742 --> 01:07:28.144
THE EXISTING BUILDING FULLY

01:07:28.210 --> 01:07:30.780
ARMED PARTICULAR- WE TRY TO

01:07:30.846 --> 01:07:33.115
EVALUATE THE RATE IMPACTS TO

01:07:33.182 --> 01:07:35.084
REMAINING NATURAL GAS CUSTOMERS

01:07:35.151 --> 01:07:36.385
SO THAT THE FOLKS THAT ARE KIND

01:07:36.452 --> 01:07:38.320
OF LEFT BEHIND IN A GAS

01:07:38.387 --> 01:07:40.956
TRANSITION PERHAPS. OF THREE

01:07:41.023 --> 01:07:44.260
APPROACHES THE FIRST WAS A BAN

01:07:44.326 --> 01:07:46.529
ON THE SALE OF EXISTING POWER

01:07:46.595 --> 01:07:50.299
GAS APPLIANCES THE SECOND WAS-

01:07:50.366 --> 01:07:52.701
INCREASED USE OF. RENEWABLE

01:07:52.768 --> 01:07:56.872
NATURAL GAS HYDROGEN AND-

01:07:56.939 --> 01:07:58.407
SYNTHETIC NATURAL GAS IN THE

01:07:58.474 --> 01:07:59.542
EXISTING PIPELINE SYSTEM

01:07:59.608 --> 01:08:01.410
RECOGNIZING CONSTRAINTS ON THE

01:08:01.477 --> 01:08:03.746
SUPPLIES OF ALL THREE OF THOSE-

01:08:03.813 --> 01:08:08.050
RESOURCES AND THE THIRD WAS-

01:08:08.117 --> 01:08:10.152
STRATEGIC DECOMMISSIONING OF

01:08:10.219 --> 01:08:11.420
THE NATURAL GAS SYSTEMATIC

01:08:11.487 --> 01:08:12.755
GOING INTO PARTICULAR

01:08:12.822 --> 01:08:14.990
NEIGHBORHOODS AND USING

01:08:15.057 --> 01:08:17.793
SUBSIDIES AND VARIOUS OTHER

01:08:17.860 --> 01:08:19.995
APPROACHES ELECTRIFYING IN

01:08:20.062 --> 01:08:21.864
NEIGHBORHOOD IN ORDER TO THEN

01:08:21.931 --> 01:08:23.532
DECOMMISSIONING GAS SYSTEM THE

01:08:23.599 --> 01:08:25.501
LAST MILE OF GAS SERVICE WITHIN

01:08:25.568 --> 01:08:27.436
THAT NEIGHBORHOOD ONCE IT HAD

01:08:27.503 --> 01:08:30.306
COMPLETELY ELECTRIFIED AND I'LL

01:08:30.372 --> 01:08:31.474
JUST SUMMARIZE OUR CONCLUSIONS

01:08:31.540 --> 01:08:32.608
QUICKLY AND THEN AND THEN GO

01:08:32.675 --> 01:08:33.943
INTO THAT MORE DEEPLY IT THAT

01:08:34.009 --> 01:08:35.811
THERE ARE NOW THIS IS- SUGGESTS

01:08:35.878 --> 01:08:37.680
A COUPLE OF THINGS THE FIRST IS

01:08:37.746 --> 01:08:39.348
THAT BECAUSE OF SAFETY

01:08:39.415 --> 01:08:41.217
INVESTMENTS THAT ARE. ALREADY

01:08:41.283 --> 01:08:43.452
GOING TO OCCUR GAS RATES ARE

01:08:43.519 --> 01:08:45.054
GONNA INCREASE QUITE

01:08:45.120 --> 01:08:46.121
SUBSTANTIALLY OVER THE NEXT

01:08:46.188 --> 01:08:48.891
DECADE. AND THAT'S BAKED IN-

01:08:48.958 --> 01:08:49.592
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S

01:08:49.658 --> 01:08:51.360
ALREADY GONNA HAPPEN. AND IT

01:08:51.427 --> 01:08:52.394
NEEDS TO BE PART OF THE BASE

01:08:52.461 --> 01:08:54.296
PLAN UNDERSTOOD TO BE. PART OF

01:08:54.363 --> 01:08:56.065
THE BASE LINE SO. THEY'RE GOING

01:08:56.131 --> 01:08:57.500
TO BE IMPACTS BECAUSE AT THE

01:08:57.566 --> 01:09:00.336
END OF THE SAFETY- IMPROVEMENTS

01:09:00.402 --> 01:09:03.072
AFTER. BOTH SAN BRUNO AND LISA

01:09:03.138 --> 01:09:04.507
CANYON. THAT ARE GONNA RAISE

01:09:04.573 --> 01:09:05.908
COSTS AND ALREADY ARE RAISING

01:09:05.975 --> 01:09:07.843
COSTS FOR RATEPAYERS.

01:09:07.910 --> 01:09:09.945
INDEPENDENT OF ANY KIND OF-

01:09:10.012 --> 01:09:11.380
COSTS VARIATION ACROSS THE

01:09:11.447 --> 01:09:13.849
NATURAL GAS. THE SECOND MAIN

01:09:13.916 --> 01:09:15.184
CONCLUSION AND WE ARRIVED AT

01:09:15.251 --> 01:09:18.053
USING- WHEN I SHOULD SAY WE

01:09:18.120 --> 01:09:20.456
UTILIZED A MODIFIED VERSION OF

01:09:20.523 --> 01:09:23.492
THE E. THREE- NATURAL GAS RATE

01:09:23.559 --> 01:09:25.227
MODEL THAT WAS DEVELOPED FOR

01:09:25.294 --> 01:09:25.961
THE ENERGY COMMISSION AS PART

01:09:26.028 --> 01:09:26.862
OF ITS WORK ON BUILDING

01:09:26.929 --> 01:09:28.497
DECARBONIZATION EATERY WAS KIND

01:09:28.564 --> 01:09:30.566
OF NOT SURE MODEL WITH US. AND

01:09:30.633 --> 01:09:32.568
WE OP AND MODIFIED BOTTLE

01:09:32.635 --> 01:09:34.470
FURTHER TO UNDERTAKE THE

01:09:34.537 --> 01:09:35.938
NONSENSE. BUT THE OTHER MAIN

01:09:36.005 --> 01:09:37.673
CONCLUSION THAT WE COME TO YOU.

01:09:37.740 --> 01:09:38.974
IS THAT WHAT ALL THREE

01:09:39.041 --> 01:09:41.110
POLICIES- BUT I JUST I

01:09:41.176 --> 01:09:43.112
MENTIONED. HAVE THE POTENTIAL

01:09:43.178 --> 01:09:45.214
TO SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE.

01:09:45.281 --> 01:09:45.714
BUILDING GREENHOUSE GAS

01:09:45.781 --> 01:09:48.083
EMISSIONS. THEY HAVE WIDELY

01:09:48.150 --> 01:09:54.156
VARYING COSTS IN PARTICULAR-

01:09:54.223 --> 01:09:55.925
AND APPLIANCE FAN OR IN

01:09:55.991 --> 01:09:58.894
APPROACH INVOLVED BIOMETHANE

01:09:58.961 --> 01:10:00.796
JOHN GREEN HYDROGEN AND

01:10:00.863 --> 01:10:03.666
SYNTHETIC NATURAL GAS APPEAR TO

01:10:03.732 --> 01:10:05.167
RAISE RATES QUITE SUBSTANTIALLY

01:10:05.234 --> 01:10:06.802
ALSO WHILE PROVIDING

01:10:06.869 --> 01:10:08.837
SIGNIFICANT EMISSION REDUCTIONS

01:10:08.904 --> 01:10:11.307
BY CONTRAST STRATEGIC

01:10:11.373 --> 01:10:12.207
DECOMMISSIONING OF THE GAS

01:10:12.274 --> 01:10:15.144
SYSTEM COULD HAVE MINIMAL

01:10:15.210 --> 01:10:17.413
EFFECTS ON RATES AND AT THE

01:10:17.479 --> 01:10:19.214
SAME TIME PRODUCE LARGE

01:10:19.281 --> 01:10:20.282
EMISSION REDUCTIONS SO THAT

01:10:20.349 --> 01:10:23.285
SOUNDS LIKE AN OBVIOUS CHOICE

01:10:23.352 --> 01:10:24.386
BUT I THINK THERE ARE IT'S

01:10:24.453 --> 01:10:25.888
IMPORTANT RECOGNIZED A COUPLE

01:10:25.955 --> 01:10:30.826
OF- CABBIE OUTS ONE IS THAT. WE

01:10:30.893 --> 01:10:32.728
DON'T CONSIDER THE OTHER SIDE

01:10:32.795 --> 01:10:34.897
EQUATION RIGHT THE COSTS OF THE

01:10:34.964 --> 01:10:36.332
INCENTIVES THAT ARE GONNA BE

01:10:36.398 --> 01:10:40.636
NECESSARY TO WHO TO DRIVE-

01:10:40.703 --> 01:10:42.171
STRATEGIC DECOMMISSIONING WE

01:10:42.237 --> 01:10:45.975
ALSO- AND WE POINT TO THIS IN

01:10:46.041 --> 01:10:47.109
THE REPORT AND I WOULD ALSO

01:10:47.176 --> 01:10:48.143
RECOMMEND THE WORD THE RECENT

01:10:48.210 --> 01:10:49.745
MARKETABILITY CARBONIZATION

01:10:49.812 --> 01:10:52.581
COALITION ON THIS ISSUE WE ALSO

01:10:52.648 --> 01:10:53.382
DON'T CAREFULLY EXAMINE IN THIS

01:10:53.449 --> 01:10:56.051
WORK THE COMPLEXITY OF SUCH AN

01:10:56.118 --> 01:10:57.486
UNDERTAKING AND I THINK IT'S

01:10:57.553 --> 01:10:59.488
IMPORTANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT

01:10:59.555 --> 01:11:01.357
THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT

01:11:01.423 --> 01:11:03.959
COMPLICATIONS WITH HER SHE'S

01:11:04.026 --> 01:11:06.362
STRATEGIC TO COMMISSION

01:11:06.428 --> 01:11:08.931
RIDICULOUS OR- THERE NEEDS TO

01:11:08.998 --> 01:11:10.332
BE THERE ARE PROBABLY NEED TO

01:11:10.399 --> 01:11:13.736
BE- LEGAL CLARIFICATION. ON

01:11:13.802 --> 01:11:15.237
THAT YOU TO GAS UTILITIES

01:11:15.304 --> 01:11:17.373
OBLIGATION TO SERVE- ANY

01:11:17.439 --> 01:11:21.477
ABILITY- UTILITY TO SUBSTITUTE

01:11:21.543 --> 01:11:23.879
GAS OR ELECTRIC SERVICE FOR GAS

01:11:23.946 --> 01:11:25.748
SERVICE NOT THAT GETS INTO YOU

01:11:25.814 --> 01:11:26.982
KNOW QUESTIONS OF ENERGY LAW

01:11:27.049 --> 01:11:29.218
AND SECTION FORTY ONE IN THE

01:11:29.284 --> 01:11:31.420
UTILITY COAT. BUT I THINK. IT'S

01:11:31.487 --> 01:11:33.656
LIKELY THAT IN ORDER TO CREATE

01:11:33.722 --> 01:11:35.391
CERTAINTY FOR THE UTILITIES

01:11:35.457 --> 01:11:35.991
THAT WOULD HAVE TO MAKE THESE

01:11:36.058 --> 01:11:38.260
LARGE INVESTMENTS- WE NEED TO

01:11:38.327 --> 01:11:39.928
PROVIDE SOME SORT OF.

01:11:39.995 --> 01:11:43.465
CLARIFICATION FOR THEM THERE ON

01:11:43.532 --> 01:11:45.868
THE LEGAL SIDE- THE OTHER THE

01:11:45.934 --> 01:11:47.069
OTHER COMPLICATION THAT WE

01:11:47.136 --> 01:11:48.937
IDENTIFY AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO

01:11:49.004 --> 01:11:51.240
ADDRESS IS REALLY ABOUT CHOICE

01:11:51.306 --> 01:11:52.875
AND HALFPENNY THESE ARE MAJOR

01:11:52.941 --> 01:11:55.944
CHANGES IN THE WAIT ENERGY

01:11:56.011 --> 01:11:58.414
SERVICES ARE PROVIDED. AND WE

01:11:58.480 --> 01:12:00.382
POINT S. AS DO OTHERS TO THE

01:12:00.449 --> 01:12:01.684
SUCCESS OF THE SAN JOAQUIN

01:12:01.750 --> 01:12:03.719
VALLEY PILOTS. AND IMPORTANT

01:12:03.786 --> 01:12:05.854
EXAMPLES FOR EMPOWERING

01:12:05.921 --> 01:12:09.058
COMMUNITIES TO MAKE CHOICES

01:12:09.124 --> 01:12:10.926
ABOUT THEIR OWN ENERGY FUTURES

01:12:10.993 --> 01:12:15.764
AND- WE ARGUE THAT- THERE ISN'T

01:12:15.831 --> 01:12:16.999
THERE IN EVEN AS WE SEEK

01:12:17.066 --> 01:12:18.267
EFFECTIVE PATHWAYS TO MOVE

01:12:18.333 --> 01:12:20.502
FORWARD IT'S IMPORTANT. THAT

01:12:20.569 --> 01:12:22.938
THE STATE THE PC ENERGY

01:12:23.005 --> 01:12:25.040
COMMISSION- PARTNER WITH

01:12:25.107 --> 01:12:28.410
COMMUNITIES TO MAKE SURE THAT-

01:12:28.477 --> 01:12:31.180
THESE CHOICES ARE TAKEN- IN

01:12:31.246 --> 01:12:33.916
PARTNERSHIP WITH AN OPPORTUNITY

01:12:33.982 --> 01:12:35.818
TO HAVE PUBLIC DISCUSSION AND

01:12:35.884 --> 01:12:38.921
DEBATE AND- WITH SURE INCE'S

01:12:38.987 --> 01:12:41.690
BACKS FUNDING WILL BE

01:12:41.757 --> 01:12:44.026
FORTHCOMING TO ALLOW FOR

01:12:44.093 --> 01:12:46.495
EQUITABLE CONVERSION IF THAT'S

01:12:46.562 --> 01:12:48.897
THE CHOICE IT'S MADE THE LAST

01:12:48.964 --> 01:12:49.898
THING I'D SAY CONCLUSION IS

01:12:49.965 --> 01:12:52.101
THAT ONE IMPORTANT- ASPECT OF

01:12:52.167 --> 01:12:54.937
OUR EXAMINATION OF RATE IMPACTS

01:12:55.003 --> 01:12:58.373
IS THAT THEY CAN BE ADDED TO

01:12:58.440 --> 01:13:00.242
AND SO THERE ARE REAL CONCERNS

01:13:00.309 --> 01:13:01.877
ABOUT FOR TAKING IN ALL OF THE

01:13:01.944 --> 01:13:03.979
ABOVE STRATEGY WHEN IT COMES TO

01:13:04.046 --> 01:13:05.080
BUILDING DECARBONIZATION

01:13:05.147 --> 01:13:08.183
BECAUSE IF WE IF WE FOR

01:13:08.250 --> 01:13:11.053
EXAMPLE. ARE PURSUE A TOTAL

01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:12.387
TWENTY FOUR STRATEGY AND

01:13:12.454 --> 01:13:17.025
PURSUE- BROWN METHANE STRATEGY

01:13:17.092 --> 01:13:19.762
AND PURSUE AN APPLIANCE BRAND

01:13:19.828 --> 01:13:21.430
STRATEGY IT COSTS MAY BE ADDED

01:13:21.497 --> 01:13:24.266
AND WE MAY FIND THAT- RATE

01:13:24.333 --> 01:13:25.534
PAYERS WHO ARE UNABLE TO

01:13:25.601 --> 01:13:27.402
ELECTRIFY OR ENOUGH PERHAPS

01:13:27.469 --> 01:13:29.404
BECAUSE THEY ARE TENANTS AND

01:13:29.471 --> 01:13:32.708
LANDLORDS CHOOSE NOT TO. MY

01:13:32.775 --> 01:13:35.043
FACE ESCALATING RATE IMPACTS

01:13:35.110 --> 01:13:36.478
DUE TO THE SORT OF COMBINATION

01:13:36.545 --> 01:13:39.014
STRATEGY WHICH SO OUR

01:13:39.081 --> 01:13:40.315
CONCLUSION RECOMMENDATION IS

01:13:40.382 --> 01:13:41.483
THAT BRANCH GROANING OR

01:13:41.550 --> 01:13:43.218
STRATEGIC DECOMMISSIONING IS

01:13:43.285 --> 01:13:44.920
REALLY THE BEST STRATEGY AT

01:13:44.987 --> 01:13:46.221
THIS THIS POINT IN TIME TO

01:13:46.288 --> 01:13:48.023
EXAMINE. AND THAT WE SHOULD BE

01:13:48.090 --> 01:13:49.691
LOOKING FOR OPPORTUNITIES

01:13:49.758 --> 01:13:51.927
WITHIN THE GAS SYSTEM TO AVOID

01:13:51.994 --> 01:13:53.796
INVESTMENTS THAT ARE UPCOMING.

01:13:53.862 --> 01:13:58.200
BYE BYE- SELECTING AREAS WHERE

01:13:58.267 --> 01:13:59.501
WORST WE'RE DECOMMISSIONING

01:13:59.568 --> 01:14:01.203
COULD OCCUR AND ASSISTING

01:14:01.270 --> 01:14:03.038
HOMEOWNERS AND COMMERCIAL

01:14:03.105 --> 01:14:05.274
ENTITIES TO MAKE THE TRANSITION

01:14:05.340 --> 01:14:07.943
AS AS NECESSARY. WE CAN ALSO BY

01:14:08.010 --> 01:14:10.412
DOING THAT. TYLER APPROACH

01:14:10.479 --> 01:14:12.047
REALLY LEARN ABOUT WHAT THE

01:14:12.114 --> 01:14:13.882
BEST APPROACH IS ARE. I JUST

01:14:13.949 --> 01:14:16.185
INCLUDES- BY SAYING THAT WE'VE

01:14:16.251 --> 01:14:18.554
DONE THIS BEFORE IN CALIFORNIA

01:14:18.620 --> 01:14:19.588
THERE ARE NUMEROUS EXAMPLES

01:14:19.655 --> 01:14:21.356
FROM HISTORY MOST NOTABLY THE

01:14:21.423 --> 01:14:23.392
TRANSITION FOR MANUFACTURE GAS

01:14:23.458 --> 01:14:25.260
AND NATURAL GAS WORK MAJOR

01:14:25.327 --> 01:14:26.361
INTERVENTIONS BY UTILITIES WERE

01:14:26.428 --> 01:14:29.531
MADE- TO SORT OF SWITCH THE WAY

01:14:29.598 --> 01:14:30.799
THAT ENERGY SERVICES WERE BEING

01:14:30.866 --> 01:14:33.969
PROVIDED TO. OUR RESIDENTIAL

01:14:34.036 --> 01:14:35.971
AND COMMERCIAL CUSTOMERS. THERE

01:14:36.038 --> 01:14:38.507
ARE PRECEDENTS. THERE ARE

01:14:38.574 --> 01:14:40.108
CHALLENGING THEY REQUIRE

01:14:40.175 --> 01:14:41.577
SIGNIFICANT EFFORT IN

01:14:41.643 --> 01:14:42.578
COORDINATION BETWEEN LOCAL

01:14:42.644 --> 01:14:44.246
GOVERNMENTS UTILITIES THAT

01:14:44.313 --> 01:14:46.782
SERVE CUSTOMERS AND THE STATE

01:14:46.849 --> 01:14:47.950
AND WE'RE HOPEFUL THAT THAT CAN

01:14:48.016 --> 01:14:49.952
OCCUR. AND THEN WE CAN SEE A

01:14:50.018 --> 01:14:52.054
FUTURE WHERE OUR BUILDINGS- ARE

01:14:52.120 --> 01:14:53.956
DOING THEIR PART TO HELP US

01:14:54.022 --> 01:14:56.792
ACHIEVE OUR TWENTY THIRTY AND

01:14:56.859 --> 01:14:57.292
TWENTY FORTY FIVE CLIENT

01:14:57.359 --> 01:14:58.427
TARGETS THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

01:14:58.493 --> 01:15:00.662
THANK YOU DR LAURA AND I'D LIKE

01:15:00.729 --> 01:15:02.631
TO THANK ALL OF OUR PANELISTS

01:15:02.698 --> 01:15:04.566
FOR THEIR REALLY COMPREHENSIVE

01:15:04.633 --> 01:15:06.768
OVERVIEW. AND FOR HIGHLIGHTING

01:15:06.835 --> 01:15:08.770
THE WAYS THAT WE CAN ADDRESS

01:15:08.837 --> 01:15:10.873
MANY OF THESE CHALLENGES. MUCH

01:15:10.939 --> 01:15:12.040
OF THE FOCUS TODAY HAS BEEN ON

01:15:12.107 --> 01:15:13.876
BUILDING ELECTRIFICATION AS A

01:15:13.942 --> 01:15:18.547
SOLUTION. TO DECARBONISATION

01:15:18.614 --> 01:15:19.414
EFFORTS SO QUESTION THAT I LIKE

01:15:19.481 --> 01:15:20.816
TO THE MOVIES GET A STAR ON

01:15:20.883 --> 01:15:23.218
THIS- WOULD BE AND TO WHOEVER

01:15:23.285 --> 01:15:24.887
FEELS UNCOMFORTABLE JUMPING IN

01:15:24.953 --> 01:15:26.388
ANSWER TO. A SHOULD

01:15:26.455 --> 01:15:27.823
ELECTRIFICATION REMAIN A

01:15:27.890 --> 01:15:30.792
CENTRAL FOCUS IF WE'RE

01:15:30.859 --> 01:15:32.394
DISCUSSING EXISTING BUILDINGS

01:15:32.461 --> 01:15:34.029
HOW MIGHT OTHER SOLUTIONS LIKE

01:15:34.096 --> 01:15:36.131
ENERGY EFFICIENCY RETROFITS AND

01:15:36.198 --> 01:15:38.500
RENEWABLE GAS OR DOCTOR

01:15:38.567 --> 01:15:40.602
FRIEDMAN BROUGHT UP HYDROGEN BE

01:15:40.669 --> 01:15:41.904
IMPLEMENTED ALONGSIDE

01:15:41.970 --> 01:15:43.872
ELECTRIFICATION TO PROMOTE

01:15:43.939 --> 01:15:46.275
BUILDING DECARBONIZATION WITH

01:15:46.341 --> 01:15:47.576
THESE BE GOOD CONCURRENT

01:15:47.643 --> 01:15:56.218
INVESTMENTS WHY OR WHY NOT. AND

01:15:56.285 --> 01:16:00.355
THAT'S FOR WHOEVER'S JEREMY BUT

01:16:00.422 --> 01:16:02.190
I'M I'M WONDERING OUR JUST

01:16:02.257 --> 01:16:04.293
SORRY IN TERMS OF THE- JUST THE

01:16:04.359 --> 01:16:06.762
INTERACTION HERE SHALL WE ALL

01:16:06.828 --> 01:16:07.362
MAYBE PUT OUR CAMERAS ON SO WE

01:16:07.429 --> 01:16:08.797
CAN ALL KIND OF RESPOND PERHAPS

01:16:08.864 --> 01:16:13.201
ANYWAY WHO ARE SO I THINK I

01:16:13.268 --> 01:16:15.103
WANT TO KEEP SOMETHING THAT

01:16:15.170 --> 01:16:17.806
DOCTOR OR A SAD- WHICH IS THAT

01:16:17.873 --> 01:16:20.709
TIGHT COORDINATION IS REQUIRED-

01:16:20.776 --> 01:16:22.744
GEOGRAPHICALLY AND BY SECTOR

01:16:22.811 --> 01:16:23.712
WORKING WITH SPECIFIC PEOPLE

01:16:23.779 --> 01:16:25.380
THERE ON SPECIFIC YOU KNOW

01:16:25.447 --> 01:16:27.683
BUILDINGS LOADS THAT ARE ON- IN

01:16:27.749 --> 01:16:28.951
ONE GEOGRAPHICAL AREA SO WE CAN

01:16:29.017 --> 01:16:31.286
STRATEGICALLY- INVEST IN

01:16:31.353 --> 01:16:33.655
ELECTRIC SYSTEM- PRUNING COULD

01:16:33.722 --> 01:16:36.959
GAS SYSTEM THAT'S THE STRATEGY-

01:16:37.025 --> 01:16:40.295
AND THAT. DOING SO WILL

01:16:40.362 --> 01:16:43.465
POTENTIALLY ENABLE- ARE IN G.

01:16:43.532 --> 01:16:43.966
TO THE EXTENT THAT IT'S

01:16:44.032 --> 01:16:45.400
AVAILABLE AT SOME VOLUME TO

01:16:45.467 --> 01:16:46.868
FOCUS ON THE HARDEST TO

01:16:46.935 --> 01:16:49.371
ELECTRIFY SECTORS OUR OUR

01:16:49.438 --> 01:16:50.772
BUILDING THE CONVERSATION

01:16:50.839 --> 01:16:52.474
ASSESSMENT FOUND THAT THAT WAS

01:16:52.541 --> 01:16:53.408
AFFIXED A RELATIVELY EXPENSIVE

01:16:53.475 --> 01:16:55.577
STRATEGY- AND THAT THE VOLUME

01:16:55.644 --> 01:16:57.746
OF IT WAS NOT AS WE CURRENTLY

01:16:57.813 --> 01:16:59.614
UNDERSTAND THAT ENOUGH TO GET

01:16:59.681 --> 01:17:01.049
US THE BUGS THAT THAT

01:17:01.116 --> 01:17:05.187
THRESHOLD- BUT- THE HIGH VALUES

01:17:05.253 --> 01:17:07.489
THERMAL APPLICATIONS THAT ARE

01:17:07.556 --> 01:17:08.757
HARD TO ELECTRIFY ACROSS THE

01:17:08.824 --> 01:17:11.460
STATE PARTICULAR INDUSTRY- AND

01:17:11.526 --> 01:17:15.397
SOME OTHER- IN USES ARE. PLACES

01:17:15.464 --> 01:17:16.365
WHERE YOU KNOW WITHOUT

01:17:16.431 --> 01:17:17.966
GEOGRAPHICAL CORRECT YOU COULD-

01:17:18.033 --> 01:17:19.301
POTENTIALLY FOCUS THOSE QUEEN

01:17:19.368 --> 01:17:20.969
MOLECULES WHERE THEY ARE

01:17:21.036 --> 01:17:23.005
RUNNING THE MOST VALUE- SO

01:17:23.071 --> 01:17:25.974
AGAIN I CAN'T EMPHASIZE ENOUGH

01:17:26.041 --> 01:17:26.641
THAT THAT COMMUNITY BASED

01:17:26.708 --> 01:17:29.611
FIRST- AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND

01:17:29.678 --> 01:17:31.480
IN TIGHT GEOGRAPHICAL

01:17:31.546 --> 01:17:33.181
COORDINATION ACROSS THE STATE

01:17:33.248 --> 01:17:33.982
WITH THE RELEVANT UTILITIES

01:17:34.049 --> 01:17:35.584
OTHER STAKEHOLDERS IS REALLY

01:17:35.650 --> 01:17:40.822
KEY. FOR DOING THIS. IN AN

01:17:40.889 --> 01:17:42.024
OPTIMIZED WHAT THANK YOU

01:17:42.090 --> 01:17:44.426
PERSICA I LOOKED TO MY TO SEE

01:17:44.493 --> 01:17:51.700
IF ANYONE ELSE DR COURT. THIS

01:17:51.767 --> 01:17:54.603
IS THE CHAIR'S SEAT AND HE'S

01:17:54.669 --> 01:17:55.203
OBVIOUSLY A LOT TALLER THAN I

01:17:55.270 --> 01:18:00.208
HAVE. SO COMMISSION MCALLISTER

01:18:00.275 --> 01:18:02.677
YOU'RE THE PERSON I'D LIKE TO

01:18:02.744 --> 01:18:05.847
BRING THESE UP TO- FIRST OF ALL

01:18:05.914 --> 01:18:07.949
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT NATURAL GAS.

01:18:08.016 --> 01:18:10.585
THE DIFFICULTY WITH EVEN WITH

01:18:10.652 --> 01:18:11.987
PHASING OUT PERHAPS A

01:18:12.054 --> 01:18:14.289
PARTICULAR REGION IS THAT

01:18:14.356 --> 01:18:16.358
THERE'S A HUGE INFRASTRUCTURE

01:18:16.425 --> 01:18:17.359
BRINGING NATURAL GAS INTO THE

01:18:17.426 --> 01:18:21.029
STATE- IT CETERA THE COST OF

01:18:21.096 --> 01:18:23.665
NATURAL GAS FOR THE REMAINING

01:18:23.732 --> 01:18:24.199
CUSTOMERS IS JUST GOING TO

01:18:24.266 --> 01:18:27.402
EXPLODE AND SUPPOSE YOU WERE TO

01:18:27.469 --> 01:18:29.471
GET RID OF YOU KNOW HALF THE

01:18:29.538 --> 01:18:32.607
NATURAL GAS SYSTEM THE OTHER

01:18:32.674 --> 01:18:35.577
HALF WOULD JUST HAVE USED COSTS

01:18:35.644 --> 01:18:38.046
SO I THINK THERE'S A REAL

01:18:38.113 --> 01:18:40.982
CONCERN THAT HAS TO BE STUDIED

01:18:41.049 --> 01:18:44.453
DEEPLY TO UNDERSTAND THIS NOW I

01:18:44.519 --> 01:18:45.954
ALSO AGREE WITH YOU THAT

01:18:46.021 --> 01:18:47.522
RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS IS NOT

01:18:47.589 --> 01:18:50.192
GOING TO BE ENOUGH OF IT TO DO

01:18:50.258 --> 01:18:52.761
MORE THAN YOU KNOW REDUCE

01:18:52.828 --> 01:19:00.168
PERHAPS OVERALL- MIND- METHANE

01:19:00.235 --> 01:19:03.071
SOMEWHAT BUT NOT A WHOLE LOT- I

01:19:03.138 --> 01:19:04.806
DO THINK HYDROGEN IS A

01:19:04.873 --> 01:19:08.043
POTENTIAL ANSWER AND CERTAINLY

01:19:08.110 --> 01:19:09.878
YOU KNOW I WAS IN NEW ENGLAND

01:19:09.945 --> 01:19:10.912
WHEN THEY MADE THE TRANSITION

01:19:10.979 --> 01:19:15.851
FROM COAL GAS TO- NATURAL GAS

01:19:15.917 --> 01:19:17.219
AND THAT WAS EASY YOU KNOW THEY

01:19:17.285 --> 01:19:19.688
JUST A FEW VALVES WERE SWITCHED

01:19:19.754 --> 01:19:25.127
ON- THE HEATING SYSTEMS-

01:19:25.193 --> 01:19:26.761
COOKING SYSTEM AT CETERA WE

01:19:26.828 --> 01:19:27.996
DON'T KNOW WITH HYDROGEN WHAT

01:19:28.063 --> 01:19:29.598
IT'S GOING TO TAKE. WHETHER OR

01:19:29.664 --> 01:19:31.733
NOT WILL BE ABLE TO USE CURRENT

01:19:31.800 --> 01:19:32.267
INFRASTRUCTURE JUST MANY

01:19:32.334 --> 01:19:34.302
QUESTIONS. THAT NEED TO BE

01:19:34.369 --> 01:19:36.371
ANSWERED SO BEFORE WE START

01:19:36.438 --> 01:19:39.141
DOWN THAT PATH WE REALLY NEED

01:19:39.207 --> 01:19:44.579
TO DO A WHOLE LOT OF WORK. SO

01:19:44.646 --> 01:19:45.780
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE US SOME

01:19:45.847 --> 01:19:47.482
COMMENTARY AROUND THOSE ISSUES.

01:19:47.549 --> 01:19:50.118
SURE A GREAT GREAT THANK YOU

01:19:50.185 --> 01:19:51.620
VERY MUCH SO I WAS BASICALLY

01:19:51.686 --> 01:19:53.488
TRYING TO GET YOU TO ADDRESS

01:19:53.555 --> 01:19:56.424
THE ISSUE WELL ABSOLUTELY AND

01:19:56.491 --> 01:19:57.692
YOU BRING UP SOME SOME CRITICAL

01:19:57.759 --> 01:19:59.094
ISSUES AND THESE ARE NOT EASY

01:19:59.161 --> 01:20:00.929
ISSUES THERE ARE STICKY AND

01:20:00.996 --> 01:20:03.798
THEY DO REQUIRE A- SOCIETY

01:20:03.865 --> 01:20:04.900
LEVEL- YOU KNOW THESE ARE

01:20:04.966 --> 01:20:06.835
GENERATIONAL SHIFTS IN THE WAY

01:20:06.902 --> 01:20:08.336
WE DO THINGS IN CALIFORNIA

01:20:08.403 --> 01:20:09.504
ALONG THE LINES OF

01:20:09.571 --> 01:20:12.007
RESTRUCTURING ITSELF FOR. YOU

01:20:12.073 --> 01:20:14.309
KNOW- YOU KNOW THIS THESE ARE

01:20:14.376 --> 01:20:15.143
LARGE INFRASTRUCTURE

01:20:15.210 --> 01:20:17.078
TRANSITIONS THEY HAVE TO HAPPEN

01:20:17.145 --> 01:20:20.182
OVER MANY YEARS AND DECADES-

01:20:20.248 --> 01:20:22.250
AND SO. SO I AGREE WITH YOU

01:20:22.317 --> 01:20:23.785
KNOW I THINK OUR NOTICES SHOWS

01:20:23.852 --> 01:20:25.787
THAT- AND THAT'S IT IT

01:20:25.854 --> 01:20:27.822
CORRELATES- WELL WITH WHAT

01:20:27.889 --> 01:20:32.093
DOCTOR WERE PRESENTED- THAT

01:20:32.160 --> 01:20:33.895
THERE WERE LIKE ON A TRIP AND

01:20:33.962 --> 01:20:36.064
THIS IS A PRETTY ROBUST.

01:20:36.131 --> 01:20:38.700
CONCLUSION REGARDLESS OF THE

01:20:38.767 --> 01:20:40.635
CHANGES AN ABSOLUTE VOLUMES OF

01:20:40.702 --> 01:20:42.871
NATURAL GAS PROJECT READ THAT

01:20:42.938 --> 01:20:44.172
WITH LOTS OF ELECTRIFICATION

01:20:44.239 --> 01:20:45.540
INCLUDING ON THE TRANSPORTATION

01:20:45.607 --> 01:20:47.108
SIDE AS WELL AS ELECTRIFICATION

01:20:47.175 --> 01:20:49.711
OF BUILDINGS. THE THERE WILL BE

01:20:49.778 --> 01:20:51.746
SOME OPPORTUNITY FOR DOWNWARD

01:20:51.813 --> 01:20:53.148
PRESSURE ON ELECTRIC RATES

01:20:53.215 --> 01:20:54.282
RIGHT NOW LIKE THE BRITS ARE

01:20:54.349 --> 01:20:55.717
HIGH IN THE INVESTMENT UTILITY

01:20:55.784 --> 01:20:58.486
TERRITORIES WILL NOW- AND- GAS

01:20:58.553 --> 01:21:00.922
RATES ARE RELATIVELY. LOW AND

01:21:00.989 --> 01:21:02.257
SO WE'RE AT THIS POINT WHERE

01:21:02.324 --> 01:21:03.558
THERE'S NOT QUITE A LEVEL

01:21:03.625 --> 01:21:04.492
PLAYING FIELD THAT'S WHAT WE

01:21:04.559 --> 01:21:05.727
HAVE TO EMPHASIZE EFFICIENT I

01:21:05.794 --> 01:21:08.563
WENT TO THE KITCHEN- BUT- WE'RE

01:21:08.630 --> 01:21:09.731
ON A TRAJECTORY WHERE THE GAS

01:21:09.798 --> 01:21:10.765
RATES ARE LIKELY TO GO UP MORE

01:21:10.832 --> 01:21:12.400
QUICKLY THAN ELECTRIC RATES AND

01:21:12.467 --> 01:21:14.703
AT SOME POINT THOSE CROSS. SO

01:21:14.769 --> 01:21:16.371
AGAIN HAVE BEEN DOING THAT AND

01:21:16.438 --> 01:21:19.441
OPTIMAL WAY REQUIRES VERY A LOT

01:21:19.507 --> 01:21:21.977
OF ATTENTION- AND A LOT OF

01:21:22.043 --> 01:21:22.811
BOOKS LOCALIZER SPECIFIC

01:21:22.877 --> 01:21:24.579
PLANNING. BUT I WILL SAY JUST

01:21:24.646 --> 01:21:26.314
TO CONCLUDE WE ARE DOING A FAIR

01:21:26.381 --> 01:21:28.016
AMOUNT A LOT ACTUALLY- HYDROGEN

01:21:28.083 --> 01:21:29.317
ARE EMPTY AT THE ENERGY

01:21:29.384 --> 01:21:30.485
COMMISSION ON SOME OF THOSE

01:21:30.552 --> 01:21:32.053
ISSUES LIKE LANDING IN THE

01:21:32.120 --> 01:21:34.389
SYSTEM. ARE WORKING WITH SO CAL

01:21:34.456 --> 01:21:35.724
GAS ON ON SEVERAL PROJECTS

01:21:35.790 --> 01:21:36.725
THERE'S SOME REALLY GREAT STUFF

01:21:36.791 --> 01:21:39.494
ON HYDROGEN HAPPENING IN LA

01:21:39.561 --> 01:21:40.929
PARTICULARLY THE HIGH DEAL.

01:21:40.996 --> 01:21:41.863
THEY'RE MAKING SOME PROGRESS

01:21:41.930 --> 01:21:43.965
THERE- BUT AGAIN YOU KNOW IF

01:21:44.032 --> 01:21:44.899
WE'RE LIMITING THIS TO

01:21:44.966 --> 01:21:46.801
BUILDINGS- I THINK THEY'RE

01:21:46.868 --> 01:21:48.003
HARDLY CONVERSATION REALLY IS A

01:21:48.069 --> 01:21:50.205
BROADER MORE. IN THAT OTHER END

01:21:50.272 --> 01:21:51.606
USES- WILL KIND OF BE THE

01:21:51.673 --> 01:21:55.944
FIRST- GATEWAY TO. TO FINDING

01:21:56.011 --> 01:21:57.946
THOSE HIGH VALUE APPLICATIONS

01:21:58.013 --> 01:21:58.446
FOR HYDROGEN AND FOR OUR

01:21:58.513 --> 01:22:00.548
ENERGY. INDUSTRIAL AND

01:22:00.615 --> 01:22:07.689
TRANSPORTATION- THE WHITE ALL

01:22:07.756 --> 01:22:08.490
RIGHT I'LL JUST ONE FINAL O

01:22:08.556 --> 01:22:10.158
THIS THAT EXTREME AMOUNTS OF MY

01:22:10.225 --> 01:22:12.360
AND YOU BETTER KNOW WHAT YOU'RE

01:22:12.427 --> 01:22:14.296
DOING YOU TRY AND PHASE IT OUT

01:22:14.362 --> 01:22:17.532
WE ALL AGREE ON THAT- AND RIGHT

01:22:17.599 --> 01:22:19.367
NOW IT'S JUST A CONCEPT GOING

01:22:19.434 --> 01:22:21.269
TO BRING UP ONE OTHER POINT.

01:22:21.336 --> 01:22:23.271
YESTERDAY THE ENERGY INSTITUTE

01:22:23.338 --> 01:22:25.974
AT HAAS- SEVERIN BORENSTEIN AND

01:22:26.041 --> 01:22:29.277
JAMES BUSHNELL- GAVE A VERY.

01:22:29.344 --> 01:22:30.779
INTERESTING WEAPON ARE

01:22:30.845 --> 01:22:32.747
ESSENTIALLY IT WAS A SYMPOSIUM

01:22:32.814 --> 01:22:36.184
UNIVERSITY SYMPOSIUM LEVEL TALK

01:22:36.251 --> 01:22:38.853
ON THE SOCIAL MARGINAL COST OF

01:22:38.920 --> 01:22:59.474
ELECTRICITY VERSUS NATURAL GAS.

01:24:08.243 --> 01:24:10.011
C. I'LL SEND YOU ONE AS WELL

01:24:10.078 --> 01:24:11.679
BUT JUST ASKING I'VE NEVER

01:24:11.746 --> 01:24:14.249
GOTTEN A QUANTITATIVE ANSWER TO

01:24:14.315 --> 01:24:17.485
THAT QUESTION WHY IS THE PRICE

01:24:17.552 --> 01:24:19.888
TWICE AS HIGH IF WE UNDERSTOOD

01:24:19.954 --> 01:24:22.190
AT LEAST WITH OTHER STAND NOT

01:24:22.257 --> 01:24:22.724
THAT WE COULD NECESSARILY

01:24:22.791 --> 01:24:26.194
REDUCE IT. NOW THE- THE

01:24:26.261 --> 01:24:27.796
PROFESSORS BROUGHT ABOUT A

01:24:27.862 --> 01:24:29.497
NUMBER OF WAYS WHERE WE COULD

01:24:29.564 --> 01:24:33.034
FIX THE PROBLEM SO ONE OF THEM

01:24:33.101 --> 01:24:35.069
WAS JUST TO SUBSIDIZE THE COST

01:24:35.136 --> 01:24:36.604
OF ELECTRICITY FROM THE GENERAL

01:24:36.671 --> 01:24:38.573
FUND I DON'T THINK THEY'LL BE

01:24:38.640 --> 01:24:40.341
TOO MANY VOTES FOR THAT HERE.

01:24:40.408 --> 01:24:41.409
UNLESS YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE

01:24:41.476 --> 01:24:43.111
SOME SORT OF A SPECIAL SOURCE

01:24:43.178 --> 01:24:46.881
OF MONEY- IDEALLY IT WOULD BE

01:24:46.948 --> 01:24:47.849
FOR THE GREENHOUSE GAS

01:24:47.916 --> 01:24:49.517
REDUCTION FUNDS BUT WE ALREADY

01:24:49.584 --> 01:24:52.153
KNOW THERE ARE MANY MORE CALLS

01:24:52.220 --> 01:24:53.588
ON THAT MONEY THAN ACTUALLY

01:24:53.655 --> 01:24:57.192
EXIST ANOTHER WAY TO DO THIS

01:24:57.258 --> 01:25:01.663
WOULD BE DO- SIMPLY LOOK AT THE

01:25:01.729 --> 01:25:05.433
COST OF THE FIXED COST VERSUS

01:25:05.500 --> 01:25:07.702
VARIABLE COST SO ANYONE WHO IS

01:25:07.769 --> 01:25:09.938
USING ELECTRICITY WOULD PAY THE

01:25:10.004 --> 01:25:12.240
FIXED COST EVERY MONTH WHICH IS

01:25:12.307 --> 01:25:13.775
PRETTY HIGH IT'S ABOUT SEVENTY

01:25:13.842 --> 01:25:15.810
DOLLARS A MONTH BUT THEN YOUR

01:25:15.877 --> 01:25:17.278
VARIABLE COSTS WOULD GO DOWN

01:25:17.345 --> 01:25:19.047
BUT IT ANY RIGHT THAT WOULD

01:25:19.113 --> 01:25:20.448
HAVE THE EFFECT OF THE USE OF

01:25:20.515 --> 01:25:22.817
ELECTRICITY. BEING LESS

01:25:22.884 --> 01:25:25.453
EXPENSIVE YOUR YOUR LARGER COST

01:25:25.520 --> 01:25:27.755
IS PROBABLY THE FIXED COSTS AND

01:25:27.822 --> 01:25:29.757
THE USE WOULD BE THAN LESS

01:25:29.824 --> 01:25:30.625
EXPENSIVE YOU'D THEN BE ABLE

01:25:30.692 --> 01:25:33.595
TO. ELECTRICITY COULD COMPETE

01:25:33.661 --> 01:25:36.998
PRICE WISE. THAT WAS ONE OF

01:25:37.065 --> 01:25:41.336
THEIR SUGGESTIONS- FOUGHT SO.

01:25:41.402 --> 01:25:43.872
HOW DO WE GET THE RIGHT PRICE

01:25:43.938 --> 01:25:50.545
SIGNAL TO USERS OF ELECTRICITY.

01:25:50.612 --> 01:25:53.681
SO I'LL JUST VERY BRIEFLY-

01:25:53.748 --> 01:25:54.849
PROVIDED ONE COMMENT IN

01:25:54.916 --> 01:25:56.684
PARTICULAR OVER TO RESTAURANTS

01:25:56.751 --> 01:26:00.688
INTO A PERHAPS AS A AS WELL I

01:26:00.755 --> 01:26:02.223
WE'RE VERY FAMILIAR WITH WITH

01:26:02.290 --> 01:26:03.324
SEVEN TO WORK ON THIS I WOULD

01:26:03.391 --> 01:26:05.994
ACTUALLY HIGHLIGHTED SOME OF

01:26:06.060 --> 01:26:06.561
OUR BUILDING DECARBONIZATION

01:26:06.628 --> 01:26:10.365
WORK- FUND IT ALSO INTEGRATE

01:26:10.431 --> 01:26:11.666
WEEK YES WE INTEGRATE ENERGY

01:26:11.733 --> 01:26:14.836
COSTS THE REPORT AND- YEAH AND

01:26:14.903 --> 01:26:16.938
OUR OUR YOU KNOW I THINK THERE

01:26:17.005 --> 01:26:19.274
ARE THERE'S A VERY LEGITIMATE

01:26:19.340 --> 01:26:20.875
STRUCTURAL QUESTIONS HERE OF

01:26:20.942 --> 01:26:22.143
COURSE RATE MAKING IS THAT I'M

01:26:22.210 --> 01:26:23.678
AT THE RESTAURANT UNTIL THESE

01:26:23.745 --> 01:26:26.147
BY THE UC AND SO. I DO KNOW

01:26:26.214 --> 01:26:30.184
THAT THEY ARE. LOOKING AT SHE'S

01:26:30.251 --> 01:26:31.886
AROUND THIS TOPIC TODAY YEAH AS

01:26:31.953 --> 01:26:33.488
WELL AS ON BOTH ELECTRIC SIDE

01:26:33.555 --> 01:26:36.257
EMMA GAS SIDE- I GUESS I AM

01:26:36.324 --> 01:26:38.393
LOOKING AT SORT OF WHAT THE

01:26:38.459 --> 01:26:40.261
COMPONENTS OF THE RATE BASE ARE

01:26:40.328 --> 01:26:40.862
FOR PER NEW INSTALLATIONS OF

01:26:40.929 --> 01:26:42.664
GAS FOR EXAMPLE. DIGGING INTO

01:26:42.730 --> 01:26:44.098
SOME OF THOSE ISSUES THAT

01:26:44.165 --> 01:26:46.734
APPROACH- ARE REFERRED TO- BUT

01:26:46.801 --> 01:26:49.370
PRICING IS AN ONGOING- SORT OF

01:26:49.437 --> 01:26:50.305
YOU KNOW DANCE IN THIS

01:26:50.371 --> 01:26:51.806
REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT THAT-

01:26:51.873 --> 01:26:54.909
YOU KNOW MONOPOLY. THAT

01:26:54.976 --> 01:26:55.810
REGULATORY BUT I FULLY

01:26:55.877 --> 01:26:58.379
REGULATED AND IN THE END THEIR

01:26:58.446 --> 01:26:59.981
COMMISSIONS- HAVE TO WRESTLE

01:27:00.048 --> 01:27:01.416
WITH AND I THINK HAVING THIS

01:27:01.482 --> 01:27:03.051
BROADER CONVERSATION ABOUT OUR

01:27:03.117 --> 01:27:05.486
POLICY DIRECTION. WILL IS

01:27:05.553 --> 01:27:08.823
ESSENTIAL TO HELP PROVIDE A

01:27:08.890 --> 01:27:09.390
FRAMEWORK IN WHICH THAT CAN

01:27:09.457 --> 01:27:11.893
HELP WITH CLEAR INTENTION TO

01:27:11.960 --> 01:27:12.927
MEET OUR LONG TERM CARBON

01:27:12.994 --> 01:27:15.029
REDUCTION GOALS- AND YOU KNOW

01:27:15.096 --> 01:27:16.331
IN THE STATE WE HAVE ELECTRIC

01:27:16.397 --> 01:27:17.699
UTILITIES AND GAS UTILITIES AND

01:27:17.765 --> 01:27:19.934
THOSE TO SOMEHOW NEED TO HAVE A

01:27:20.001 --> 01:27:23.204
CROSSWALK. SO WHAT WITHOUT ANY

01:27:23.271 --> 01:27:24.906
PETS THAT'S GOING TO WEAR ON IT

01:27:24.973 --> 01:27:27.508
THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION

01:27:27.575 --> 01:27:29.177
RIGHT I'VE ONE LAST QUESTION

01:27:29.243 --> 01:27:32.046
THE AND THEN I'LL HOWEVER MY

01:27:32.113 --> 01:27:34.682
COLLEAGUES SO OKAY WITH THE

01:27:34.749 --> 01:27:37.085
COMPRESSOR RIGHT COULD COULD

01:27:37.151 --> 01:27:38.386
THAT TIME AND THERE'S A LOT I

01:27:38.453 --> 01:27:39.854
DIDN'T QUITE GIVE IT A FULL

01:27:39.921 --> 01:27:42.523
ANSWER THE SECOND ONE ONE THING

01:27:42.590 --> 01:27:44.859
IN RESPONSE TO ASSEMBLYMEMBER

01:27:44.926 --> 01:27:46.294
QUIRK'S QUESTION I THINK IT'S A

01:27:46.361 --> 01:27:47.862
REALLY VALID QUESTION AND

01:27:47.929 --> 01:27:49.364
THERE'S THAT SORT OF BASIC

01:27:49.430 --> 01:27:52.667
ISSUE AROUND. WHAT WE INCLUDE

01:27:52.734 --> 01:27:54.836
AN ELECTRIC RATES AND WHAT WE

01:27:54.902 --> 01:27:58.139
RECOVER FROM TAXPAYERS OTHER

01:27:58.206 --> 01:28:00.241
OTHER SOURCES IN OTHER WAYS

01:28:00.308 --> 01:28:03.211
AND- I THINK IT RELIGION THE

01:28:03.277 --> 01:28:03.878
QUESTIONS TO BE ASKED ABOUT

01:28:03.945 --> 01:28:06.080
WHETHER. EVERYTHING WE'RE

01:28:06.147 --> 01:28:07.415
GETTING FROM ELECTRIC RATES

01:28:07.482 --> 01:28:09.083
SHOULD BE THERE OR WHETHER YOU

01:28:09.150 --> 01:28:10.818
KNOW MAYBE THE GENERAL FUND IS

01:28:10.885 --> 01:28:12.153
THE RIGHT PLACE TO BE LOOKING

01:28:12.220 --> 01:28:13.621
OR THE G. CARE ACT AS YOU

01:28:13.688 --> 01:28:16.190
SUGGESTED ASSEMBLY MEMBER WORK-

01:28:16.257 --> 01:28:19.160
ANOTHER QUESTION THAT- I THINK

01:28:19.227 --> 01:28:21.462
WE NEED TO GET RIGHT. INVOLVES

01:28:21.529 --> 01:28:23.064
HOW THE TO THE STRUCTURE OF

01:28:23.131 --> 01:28:24.799
RATES AND HOW RATES ARE COVERED

01:28:24.866 --> 01:28:26.768
IN AND PROFESSOR BORNSTEIN AND

01:28:26.834 --> 01:28:27.735
BUSH KNOWLEDGE MADE SOME

01:28:27.802 --> 01:28:28.636
INTERESTING SUGGESTIONS THEY'VE

01:28:28.703 --> 01:28:29.570
ALSO MADE INTERESTING

01:28:29.637 --> 01:28:31.372
SUGGESTIONS PERSPECTIVE ST

01:28:31.439 --> 01:28:35.176
ENERGY RESOURCES. RECENTLY. AND

01:28:35.243 --> 01:28:36.310
I THINK ALL OF THIS ON YOU KNOW

01:28:36.377 --> 01:28:40.415
WITHOUT ENDORSING YOU I THINK

01:28:40.481 --> 01:28:41.983
WE NEED TO BE THINKING AS A

01:28:42.050 --> 01:28:43.685
STATE VERY CAREFULLY BECAUSE WE

01:28:43.751 --> 01:28:44.552
HAVE FACE SOME REALLY

01:28:44.619 --> 01:28:46.554
UNPRECEDENTED CRISES IN THE

01:28:46.621 --> 01:28:48.456
POWER SECTOR AS WE ALL NOW AND

01:28:48.523 --> 01:28:50.124
WE ALL HAD TO DEAL WITH OVER

01:28:50.191 --> 01:28:53.027
THE LAST FIVE TO TEN YEARS-

01:28:53.094 --> 01:28:54.996
DOES IT RAISE COSTS AND WE'RE

01:28:55.063 --> 01:28:57.065
APPROACHING IN A CERTAIN WAY-

01:28:57.131 --> 01:28:59.434
AND DOES HAPPEN THOSE COSTS ARE

01:28:59.500 --> 01:29:01.135
PASSED THROUGH TO RAISE RATES

01:29:01.202 --> 01:29:04.839
TO RATE PAYERS. AND SO I GUESS

01:29:04.906 --> 01:29:06.674
THE THING THAT I WOULD SAY THAT

01:29:06.741 --> 01:29:09.243
THE CLAIM THAT I WOULD STAKE IS

01:29:09.310 --> 01:29:10.878
THAT WE DO NEED TO BE THINKING

01:29:10.945 --> 01:29:13.848
HOLISTICALLY AND I WOULD JUST

01:29:13.915 --> 01:29:14.916
SAY THAT. MY SENSE IS NOT THE

01:29:14.982 --> 01:29:17.085
COMMISSION. RCT ENERGY

01:29:17.151 --> 01:29:18.352
COMMISSION THE P. YOU SEE ANY

01:29:18.419 --> 01:29:21.255
ISO. ARE WORKING TOGETHER TO

01:29:21.322 --> 01:29:22.924
TRY TO FIGURE THIS OUT AND TO

01:29:22.990 --> 01:29:23.958
THINK HOLISTICALLY ABOUT THIS

01:29:24.025 --> 01:29:26.661
PROBLEM. THE ON BOX FROM RATES

01:29:26.728 --> 01:29:28.429
THIS YEAR WHAT'S REALLY

01:29:28.496 --> 01:29:29.530
IMPORTANT IN FURTHERING THAT

01:29:29.597 --> 01:29:31.132
CONVERSATION. THE STAFF WHITE

01:29:31.199 --> 01:29:33.000
PAPER IN PARTICULAR ALSO WAS

01:29:33.067 --> 01:29:35.436
VERY HELPFUL. AND I LOOK

01:29:35.503 --> 01:29:36.971
FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO HAVE

01:29:37.038 --> 01:29:38.172
THAT CONVERSATION IN CALIFORNIA

01:29:38.239 --> 01:29:39.407
TRYING TO WORK TOWARD SOLUTIONS

01:29:39.474 --> 01:29:41.642
BUT IT IS NOT EASY YEAH AND-

01:29:41.709 --> 01:29:44.245
AND- THAT'S PROBABLY GOOD. YEAH

01:29:44.312 --> 01:29:46.280
I THINK WE CAN ALL GET RESERVE

01:29:46.347 --> 01:29:49.650
ID'S SO THE MUCH STATEMENT THE

01:29:49.717 --> 01:29:51.486
FACT THAT YOU KNOW THE RELATIVE

01:29:51.552 --> 01:29:52.787
TRAJECTORIES OF GAS ELECTRIC

01:29:52.854 --> 01:29:55.223
RATES- ACTUALLY CAME FROM THE

01:29:55.289 --> 01:29:57.325
WORK THAT WAS ELABORATE AROUND

01:29:57.391 --> 01:29:58.292
THAT ON BALK AT SOME OF THE

01:29:58.359 --> 01:29:59.293
WORK TO BE DONE. THE COMMISSION

01:29:59.360 --> 01:30:01.929
SO- SO I THINK THAT MIGHT BE

01:30:01.996 --> 01:30:03.931
THAT THE- THE ENERGY AGENCIES

01:30:03.998 --> 01:30:06.567
ARE ACUTELY AWARE OF THIS. AND

01:30:06.634 --> 01:30:09.771
THE ISSUE OF A LIABILITY THAT

01:30:09.837 --> 01:30:10.805
IS FUNDAMENTAL TO OUR YEAH AND

01:30:10.872 --> 01:30:12.974
IT GENERAL I PART OF THE HERE

01:30:13.040 --> 01:30:14.542
WILL BE POLITICAL AND WHATEVER

01:30:14.609 --> 01:30:18.012
WE DO- BUT WE'D WE'D APPRECIATE

01:30:18.079 --> 01:30:20.782
GETTING SOME INFORMATION FROM

01:30:20.848 --> 01:30:21.983
THE AGENCIES AND SOME

01:30:22.049 --> 01:30:23.785
SUGGESTIONS ON DIRECTIONS TO GO

01:30:23.851 --> 01:30:26.287
AND- WE DON'T HAVE THAT

01:30:26.354 --> 01:30:29.157
EXPERTISE HERE THE FINAL

01:30:29.223 --> 01:30:30.625
QUESTION I'M GONNA RAISE A

01:30:30.691 --> 01:30:32.527
CONCERN THAT I KNOW I'VE TALKED

01:30:32.593 --> 01:30:34.295
WITH THE CHAIROF THE

01:30:34.362 --> 01:30:36.397
COMMISSION A NUMBER OF TIMES

01:30:36.464 --> 01:30:39.433
YOU HAVE MANDATED- SOLAR ON NEW

01:30:39.500 --> 01:30:41.769
BUILDINGS. YOU'RE ABOUT TO

01:30:41.836 --> 01:30:43.838
MANDATE EVEN MORE SOLAR IF THE

01:30:43.905 --> 01:30:45.139
NEWS ARTICLES I'M READING ARE

01:30:45.206 --> 01:30:48.442
CORRECT THE PROBLEM IS AND I

01:30:48.509 --> 01:30:50.144
KNOW THE P. YOU SEE IS LOOKING

01:30:50.211 --> 01:30:53.080
AT. AT THE- AT THE WAY IN WHICH

01:30:53.147 --> 01:30:55.383
SUBSIDIZED BUT IT'S SUBSIDIZED

01:30:55.449 --> 01:30:58.519
TO A FAIRLY LARGE XM SEVERIN

01:30:58.586 --> 01:31:00.555
BORENSTEIN ESTIMATES THAT ITS

01:31:00.621 --> 01:31:02.356
TWO CENTS A KILOWATT HOUR NOW

01:31:02.423 --> 01:31:03.925
FOR EVERY CUSTOMER. FOR THE

01:31:03.991 --> 01:31:04.992
SUBSIDY SIMPLY FOR THE

01:31:05.059 --> 01:31:06.227
RESIDENTIAL MA'AM THAT WE'VE

01:31:06.294 --> 01:31:08.362
BEEN. DOING AND IT COULD BECOME

01:31:08.429 --> 01:31:10.565
A LOT LARGER AND I'M HOPING

01:31:10.631 --> 01:31:13.901
BEFORE YOU MAKE THIS DECISION

01:31:13.968 --> 01:31:15.403
TO FIRST OF ALL IT'S JUST.

01:31:15.469 --> 01:31:17.038
CHEAPER TO DO UTILITY SCALE

01:31:17.104 --> 01:31:21.375
SOLAR AND SO TO MANDATE IT

01:31:21.442 --> 01:31:22.844
DOESN'T ACTUALLY GIVE US MORE

01:31:22.910 --> 01:31:24.579
SOLAR ENERGY BECAUSE WE'VE

01:31:24.645 --> 01:31:26.881
ALREADY SAID WE'RE GOING TO. GO

01:31:26.948 --> 01:31:29.317
TO A 100% RENEWABLES RELATIVELY

01:31:29.383 --> 01:31:31.018
AND CHANCES ARE WE'RE GOING TO

01:31:31.085 --> 01:31:33.821
MOVE THAT DATE UP. EVEN CLOSER

01:31:33.888 --> 01:31:36.290
TO THE CURRENT TIME SO WE'RE

01:31:36.357 --> 01:31:37.158
GOING TO GO TO ALL RENEWABLE

01:31:37.225 --> 01:31:39.460
ENERGY WHY ARE WE THOUGHT WHY

01:31:39.527 --> 01:31:41.562
THEN ARE YOU AND MAYBE YOU'VE

01:31:41.629 --> 01:31:43.331
GOT A GOOD REASON I DON'T KNOW.

01:31:43.397 --> 01:31:44.966
WHY THEY'RE YOU MANDATING THAT

01:31:45.032 --> 01:31:46.868
THE B. BUT BE DONE IN THE MOST

01:31:46.934 --> 01:31:49.103
EXPENSIVE WAY POSSIBLE ONE OF

01:31:49.170 --> 01:31:50.771
OUR BIG PROBLEMS WITH

01:31:50.838 --> 01:31:53.574
CONVERTING OVER TO ELECTRICITY

01:31:53.641 --> 01:31:58.713
IS SIMPLY THE HIGH COST. SO

01:31:58.779 --> 01:31:59.480
THANKS FOR THAT QUESTION I'M

01:31:59.547 --> 01:32:00.815
I'M VERY FAMILIAR WITH THAT

01:32:00.882 --> 01:32:02.350
WITH PROFESSOR FOR INSTANCE-

01:32:02.416 --> 01:32:04.452
VIEWS ON THIS WE HAVE WE HAVE.

01:32:04.518 --> 01:32:05.152
SOME BACK AND FORTH

01:32:05.219 --> 01:32:07.421
PERIODICALLY ABOUT THIS- AND I

01:32:07.488 --> 01:32:09.624
AM. YOU KNOW AS THE LEAGUE

01:32:09.690 --> 01:32:10.691
COMMISSIONER ON THE BUILDING

01:32:10.758 --> 01:32:12.326
CODE NO I SHEPHERD THIS THESE

01:32:12.393 --> 01:32:14.395
PACKAGES EVERY THREE YEARS- AND

01:32:14.462 --> 01:32:16.864
WE JUST AS YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT.

01:32:16.931 --> 01:32:17.398
TWENTY TWENTY TWO BUILDING

01:32:17.465 --> 01:32:19.500
CHARACTER EXPANSE PEAVEY.

01:32:19.567 --> 01:32:21.369
REQUIREMENT MODESTLY BUT IT

01:32:21.435 --> 01:32:23.738
DOES EXPAND INTO SOME OF YOUR

01:32:23.804 --> 01:32:24.438
NON RESIDENTIAL SOME

01:32:24.505 --> 01:32:26.073
NONRESIDENTIAL CATEGORIES IN

01:32:26.140 --> 01:32:28.009
ADDITION TO THAT SINGLE FAMILY

01:32:28.075 --> 01:32:30.344
SO THERE ARE BENEFITS ACTUALLY

01:32:30.411 --> 01:32:31.646
TO DOING IT IN A DISTRIBUTED

01:32:31.712 --> 01:32:34.115
WAY VERSUS- UTILITY SCALE AND

01:32:34.181 --> 01:32:36.317
SO. AND THIS ISN'T AN EITHER OR

01:32:36.384 --> 01:32:37.885
IT'S- IT'S ABOUT WITH ME AND WE

01:32:37.952 --> 01:32:39.754
NEED WE NEED LARGE SCALE AND WE

01:32:39.820 --> 01:32:42.590
NEED DISTRICTS- AND- WE IN THE

01:32:42.657 --> 01:32:43.958
NEXT FINANCIAL INTO THE

01:32:44.025 --> 01:32:45.593
NONRESIDENTIAL CATEGORIES WE

01:32:45.660 --> 01:32:47.261
ACTUALLY HEAR THAT WITH BATTERY

01:32:47.328 --> 01:32:49.297
SYSTEMS. IN OUR ANALYSIS SHOWS

01:32:49.363 --> 01:32:50.498
THAT THIS IS VERY COST

01:32:50.564 --> 01:32:51.799
EFFECTIVE UNDER CURRENT RATES

01:32:51.866 --> 01:32:53.501
CERTAINLY FOR END USERS POSTS

01:32:53.567 --> 01:32:55.136
BOTH RESIDENTIAL. AND

01:32:55.202 --> 01:32:57.338
NONRESIDENTIAL- BUT THAT EVEN

01:32:57.405 --> 01:32:59.440
UNDER SO. WIDE ARRAY OF

01:32:59.507 --> 01:33:07.248
SCENARIOS FOR FUTURE RIGHTS.

01:33:07.315 --> 01:33:08.015
GIVEN GIVEN THAT THE DECLINING

01:33:08.082 --> 01:33:11.118
COSTS OF SOLAR THE IN DECLINE

01:33:11.185 --> 01:33:12.653
ACROSS THE STORE AS WELL THAT

01:33:12.720 --> 01:33:14.355
THIS WILL REMAIN THE CASE IN IN

01:33:14.422 --> 01:33:16.991
NEAR FUTURE IN IN THE LONG TERM

01:33:17.058 --> 01:33:18.426
WITH THE WITH THESE RESOURCE

01:33:18.492 --> 01:33:23.197
BEING YES THEY WERE SO I WILL

01:33:23.264 --> 01:33:24.231
JUST POINT OUT THERE IS A LOT

01:33:24.298 --> 01:33:25.766
OF FLEXIBILITY IN THE WAY THAT

01:33:25.833 --> 01:33:27.101
THOSE SORTS REQUIREMENTS

01:33:27.168 --> 01:33:29.036
INCLUDING OPINION STORAGE BE

01:33:29.103 --> 01:33:31.305
PARTICULARLY ARE FIVE AND SO IF

01:33:31.372 --> 01:33:33.341
THE BUILDING IS- HAS A

01:33:33.407 --> 01:33:35.343
FOOTPRINT WHAT DOESN'T. ALLOW

01:33:35.409 --> 01:33:37.345
FOR THAT MUCH SPACE AND THEY'RE

01:33:37.411 --> 01:33:38.412
TALKING ABOUT MULTI FAMILY AND

01:33:38.479 --> 01:33:40.881
NON RESIDENTIAL ALLOW FOR SOLAR

01:33:40.948 --> 01:33:42.016
ON THE ROOF AND THERE ARE SOME

01:33:42.083 --> 01:33:44.819
EXEMPTIONS THERE. ALSO THERE'S

01:33:44.885 --> 01:33:46.387
A COST EFFECTIVENESS OUT WHERE.

01:33:46.454 --> 01:33:47.521
CITY UTILITY OF A LOCAL

01:33:47.588 --> 01:33:49.090
GOVERNMENT FILES WITH US TO SAY

01:33:49.156 --> 01:33:50.758
HEY THAT'S NOT COST EFFECTIVE-

01:33:50.825 --> 01:33:52.793
SO. FOR EXAMPLE IT RATES REALLY

01:33:52.860 --> 01:33:57.365
JUST. NEVER WENT AWAY

01:33:57.431 --> 01:33:59.133
COMPLETELY DO I COMPLETELY THAT

01:33:59.200 --> 01:34:00.768
THERE CAN'T GET THEIR A THERE'S

01:34:00.835 --> 01:34:03.871
A PATHWAY ACTUALLY GET AN EXAM

01:34:03.938 --> 01:34:05.806
FOR THAT REQUIREMENT IN THE

01:34:05.873 --> 01:34:06.440
BUILDING CODE AND THAT'S WE DID

01:34:06.507 --> 01:34:07.274
THAT WE WORK THROUGH THAT AND

01:34:07.341 --> 01:34:09.343
SHE WITH STATE SO THERE'S A

01:34:09.410 --> 01:34:11.078
RESILIENCE TO HAVING

01:34:11.145 --> 01:34:13.247
DISTRIBUTED ENERGY RESOURCES-

01:34:13.314 --> 01:34:18.085
IF THAT DOES HAVE VALUE- AND SO

01:34:18.152 --> 01:34:19.587
OVER TIME AS WE HAVE BOTH SMALL

01:34:19.653 --> 01:34:21.255
SCALE DISTRIBUTED SOLAR

01:34:21.322 --> 01:34:24.392
STORAGE. AND AGREE THAT WE ALSO

01:34:24.458 --> 01:34:26.927
NEED LARGE SCALE- YEAH WHICH

01:34:26.994 --> 01:34:30.398
STORAGE AS WELL- WILL WILL BE-

01:34:30.464 --> 01:34:31.665
ON BOTH ENDS OF THE SYSTEM WILL

01:34:31.732 --> 01:34:34.969
HAVE MORE ROBUST- GREAT WELL DO

01:34:35.036 --> 01:34:37.838
YOU HAVE A STUDY THAT SHOWS

01:34:37.905 --> 01:34:40.307
WHAT THE SAVINGS ARE BY PUTTING

01:34:40.374 --> 01:34:42.510
IT ON A ROOF AS OPPOSED TO OUR

01:34:42.576 --> 01:34:44.145
OR AT LEAST THE COST TRADE OFFS

01:34:44.211 --> 01:34:45.479
BECAUSE FRANKLY I DON'T BELIEVE

01:34:45.546 --> 01:34:47.148
YOU'RE GOING TO BE SAFE ABLE TO

01:34:47.214 --> 01:34:48.883
SAVE MUCH IN TRANSMISSION AND

01:34:48.949 --> 01:34:50.818
DISTRIBUTION BECAUSE YOU HAVE

01:34:50.885 --> 01:34:52.720
THE LOCAL SOLAR IF ANYTHING

01:34:52.787 --> 01:34:54.121
THERE COULD BE ADDITIONAL COSTS

01:34:54.188 --> 01:34:56.023
BECAUSE YOU'RE GENERATING THAT

01:34:56.090 --> 01:34:58.092
AT THE WRONG TIME OF DAY. AND

01:34:58.159 --> 01:34:59.093
THE OTHER THING IS YOU'RE NOT

01:34:59.160 --> 01:35:00.961
GOING TO HAVE RENTAL HOMES LIKE

01:35:01.028 --> 01:35:03.931
THE ONE I LIVE IN I LIVE IN A

01:35:03.998 --> 01:35:05.499
LARGE RENTAL. APARTMENT AND

01:35:05.566 --> 01:35:06.967
YEAH BE SUBSIDIZING THE

01:35:07.034 --> 01:35:09.003
HOMEOWNERS AND I JUST DON'T

01:35:09.070 --> 01:35:10.471
THINK THAT'S FAIR BUT IF YOU

01:35:10.538 --> 01:35:12.106
CAN SHOW ME ECONOMICALLY WILL

01:35:12.173 --> 01:35:14.141
WORK PLEASE SEND ME THE

01:35:14.208 --> 01:35:17.845
INFORMATION 

01:35:17.912 --> 01:35:19.980
WE DO KNOW IS THAT FROM THE

01:35:20.047 --> 01:35:21.048
POINT OF VIEW OF THE CONSUMER

01:35:21.115 --> 01:35:27.788
UNDER A VAST ARRAY OF. SO- BUT

01:35:27.855 --> 01:35:29.557
I'M HAPPY TO ENGAGE IN A DEEPER

01:35:29.623 --> 01:35:31.659
DISCUSSION ABOUT THIS- WHAT IS

01:35:31.725 --> 01:35:34.728
THE TO STOP BECAUSE I THINK WE

01:35:34.795 --> 01:35:35.796
JUST GO BACK AND FORTH WITH

01:35:35.863 --> 01:35:37.164
THAT. WE NEED SOMETHING

01:35:37.231 --> 01:35:38.699
QUANTITATIVE BUT I WILL SAY

01:35:38.766 --> 01:35:40.401
THIS IS ONLY COST EFFECTIVE FOR

01:35:40.468 --> 01:35:43.037
THE PEOPLE TO BUY SOLAR BECAUSE

01:35:43.104 --> 01:35:44.705
OTHER PEOPLE PAY THE COSTS AND

01:35:44.772 --> 01:35:46.540
I THINK WE COULD GO BACK AND

01:35:46.607 --> 01:35:48.142
FORTH ON THIS BUT UNLESS WE GET

01:35:48.209 --> 01:35:50.411
SOMETHING QUANTITATIVE. I DON'T

01:35:50.478 --> 01:35:52.813
THINK WE HAVE AN ANSWER. AND IF

01:35:52.880 --> 01:35:54.715
I COULD I'M ACTUALLY I DON'T

01:35:54.782 --> 01:35:57.118
YEAH I THINK IT'S- A BIG DOCTOR

01:35:57.184 --> 01:35:59.420
COURT PUT A NICE FIVE POINT ON

01:35:59.487 --> 01:36:01.722
THAT AND I THINK IT IS REQUIRE

01:36:01.789 --> 01:36:02.289
FOR PROBABLY SOME ADDITIONAL

01:36:02.356 --> 01:36:04.592
CONVERSATION IF I COULD GO AND

01:36:04.658 --> 01:36:06.894
I AND I WILL GIVE. ALL OF YOU A

01:36:06.961 --> 01:36:07.995
CHANCE TO MAKE SOME CLOSING

01:36:08.062 --> 01:36:09.897
COMMENTS IF YOU CAN MAYBE HOLD.

01:36:09.964 --> 01:36:10.698
YOUR THOUGHT OF THAT BECAUSE I

01:36:10.764 --> 01:36:11.966
DO WANT TO TURN TO SOME OF THE

01:36:12.032 --> 01:36:13.000
OTHER MEMBERS WHO DO HAVE

01:36:13.067 --> 01:36:14.768
QUESTIONS THAT THEY'D LIKE TO

01:36:14.835 --> 01:36:17.371
DEPOSE AND SO SURE RIVAS THE

01:36:17.438 --> 01:36:24.145
FLOOR IS YOURS. I WANT TO THANK

01:36:24.211 --> 01:36:25.546
ALL THE PANELISTS TOWN FOR

01:36:25.613 --> 01:36:28.082
THEIR PRESENTATIONS AND- THIS

01:36:28.149 --> 01:36:30.184
OPPORTUNITY TO THINK OF WHAT.

01:36:30.251 --> 01:36:32.319
HOW DO WE DECARBONISE EXISTING

01:36:32.386 --> 01:36:34.255
BUILDINGS- THAT'S WHAT I'VE

01:36:34.321 --> 01:36:36.290
BEEN THINKING OF IN. YOU KNOW I

IN EXTREME HEAT- BELL BUT-

01:36:41.762 --> 01:36:44.098
STRATEGY FOR THE STATE- THANK

YOU TO JOSE- FOR BRINGING THAT

01:36:47.334 --> 01:36:50.971
UP- DURING HIS PRESENTATION OF

01:36:51.038 --> 01:36:52.640
BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN THINKING

01:36:52.706 --> 01:36:55.309
ABOUT HEAT THIS YEAR AND VERY

01:36:55.376 --> 01:36:57.478
TIMELY BECAUSE OF THE RECENT

01:36:57.545 --> 01:37:00.181
HEAT WAVES ALL OVER. I'M NOT

01:37:00.247 --> 01:37:02.583
JUST IN OUR STATE- BUT YOU KNOW

01:37:02.650 --> 01:37:03.784
IN OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY

01:37:03.851 --> 01:37:06.287
THAT. TRADITIONALLY DO NOT

01:37:06.353 --> 01:37:09.723
HAVE- EXTREME ENDS FOCUS MY

01:37:09.790 --> 01:37:13.127
COMMENTS ON THE COOLING SIDE OF

01:37:13.194 --> 01:37:16.163
D. CARBON IT DECARBONIZING

01:37:16.230 --> 01:37:18.032
BUILDINGS AND I KNOW SOME OF

01:37:18.098 --> 01:37:20.434
YOU TALKED ABOUT HEAT PUMPS AND

01:37:20.501 --> 01:37:25.139
OTHER ALTERNATIVES TO AIR

01:37:25.206 --> 01:37:28.275
A LOT OF- RESIDENTS. AND

01:37:28.342 --> 01:37:30.244
BUILDINGS THATDON'T HAVE AIR

01:37:30.311 --> 01:37:32.346
CONDITIONING RIGHT NOW AND I

01:37:32.413 --> 01:37:34.181
THINK OF THAT A LOT OF THE LOW

01:37:34.248 --> 01:37:36.517
INCOME HOUSEHOLDS- THAT ARE

01:37:36.584 --> 01:37:38.118
LEAST LIKELY TO HAVE

01:37:38.185 --> 01:37:40.754
UNFORTUNATELY HAVE ANY TYPE OF

01:37:40.821 --> 01:37:42.823
COOLING. I'VE AND- AND IF WE

01:37:42.890 --> 01:37:45.025

OKAY HOW DO WE PROVIDE COOLING.

01:37:47.228 --> 01:37:48.128
I DON'T THINK IT NECESSARILY

01:37:48.195 --> 01:37:49.496
HAS TO BE AIR CONDITIONING I

01:37:49.563 --> 01:37:51.999
THINK WE CAN ACHIEVE. BOTH

01:37:52.066 --> 01:37:53.634
GOALS RIGHT OF THE

01:37:53.701 --> 01:37:56.537
DECARBONIZING EXISTING

01:37:56.604 --> 01:37:59.773
BUILDINGS AND- PROVIDING.

01:37:59.840 --> 01:38:01.475
COOLING YOU KNOW AND I AND

01:38:01.542 --> 01:38:05.079
BECAUSE OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND

01:38:05.145 --> 01:38:08.682
THE HEALTH EFFECTS. OF SO OF IN

01:38:08.749 --> 01:38:12.987
TERMS OF YOU KNOW I THINK OF AN

01:38:13.053 --> 01:38:15.022
OPPORTUNITY OF EXISTING

01:38:15.089 --> 01:38:16.323
BUILDINGS MAYBE WHEN THEY'RE

01:38:16.390 --> 01:38:20.694
LOOKING TO UPGRADE OR THEY HAVE

01:38:20.761 --> 01:38:22.663
TO REPLACE THEIR EXISTING- AIR

01:38:22.730 --> 01:38:25.466
CONDITIONING SYSTEM WHAT CAN WE

01:38:25.532 --> 01:38:30.504
DO TO IN EITHER INCENTIVIZE OR

01:38:30.571 --> 01:38:33.274
PROMOTE- ANOTHER FORM OF

01:38:33.340 --> 01:38:36.477
CHOLINE OR DO WE NEED MORE

01:38:42.249 --> 01:38:43.751
OUR EXISTING AIR CONDITIONING

01:38:43.817 --> 01:38:45.919
SYSTEMS THAT'S THOSE ARE

01:38:45.986 --> 01:38:47.421
SYSTEMS THAT THERE HAS BEEN

01:38:47.488 --> 01:38:49.657
VERY LITTLE INNOVATION OVER THE

01:38:49.723 --> 01:38:51.392
YEARS RIGHT I IMAGINE THIS IS

01:38:51.458 --> 01:38:52.960

HE PUTS BASS AND ENCONTRA TO

01:40:40.300 --> 01:40:43.237
THE TRADITIONAL SO I THINK PER

01:40:43.303 --> 01:40:43.937
I BRING THAT UP TO THAT WHY

01:40:44.004 --> 01:40:46.840
THERE'S A FOCUS YOU KNOW ON

01:40:46.907 --> 01:40:47.775

FOR MISS KUMAR- WATER IN YOUR

01:42:21.635 --> 01:42:23.370
ESTIMATION THE MAJOR COST

01:42:23.437 --> 01:42:26.139
BARRIERS AND IMPACTS TO RENTERS

01:42:26.206 --> 01:42:28.275
AND LOW INCOME FAMILIES. AND

01:42:28.342 --> 01:42:30.911

SUGGEST OR ARE THERE ANY

01:42:39.586 --> 01:42:42.723
CHALLENGES TO DECARBONISING

01:42:42.789 --> 01:42:45.058
MULTI FAMILY HOMES FOR

01:42:45.125 --> 01:42:47.928
AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS. THAT

01:42:47.995 --> 01:42:48.428
CAN BE ADDRESSED BY THE

01:42:48.495 --> 01:42:55.602
LEGISLATURE. YET HERE ARE SOME

01:42:55.669 --> 01:42:57.671
OF THE MAJOR SEARCH ON THE NEW

01:42:57.738 --> 01:42:59.406
CONSTRUCTION SITE BE ARE SAYING

01:42:59.473 --> 01:43:01.174
THAT IT'S LARGELY COST NEUTRAL

01:43:01.241 --> 01:43:02.042
FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING

01:43:02.109 --> 01:43:04.244
DEVELOPERS TO DO THIS WORK AND

01:43:04.311 --> 01:43:05.812
ON THE NEW CAR- ON THE EXISTING

01:43:05.879 --> 01:43:07.347
BUILDING SIDE JUST A SHORT

01:43:07.414 --> 01:43:09.383
AMOUNT OF WORK AND THE LIMITED

01:43:09.449 --> 01:43:11.418
OPERATING BUDGET THAT THEY'RE

01:43:11.485 --> 01:43:13.353
ALL CHAD ITSELF POSES A

01:43:13.420 --> 01:43:16.623
PROBLEM. AND AS I SAID I THINK

01:43:16.690 --> 01:43:17.925
OF THE WEIGHT AFFORDABLE

01:43:17.991 --> 01:43:19.626
HOUSING FINANCING SYSTEM IS SET

01:43:19.693 --> 01:43:21.828
UP IS PROBLEMATIC AS WELL

01:43:21.895 --> 01:43:23.363
BECAUSE IN A LOT OF INSTANCES

01:43:23.430 --> 01:43:25.966
BRANCH YOU OF SWITCHING CAN GET

01:43:26.033 --> 01:43:28.268
COMPLICATED AND TRICKY WHERE

01:43:28.335 --> 01:43:30.203
ESPECIALLY IN CENTRAL DOMESTIC

01:43:30.270 --> 01:43:31.371
OPERATOR HEATING IS WHERE WE

01:43:31.438 --> 01:43:32.839
ARE SEEING AN ISSUE RIGHT NOW

01:43:32.906 --> 01:43:35.108
IN EXISTING BUILDINGS. SO TO

01:43:35.175 --> 01:43:37.177
REPLACE THAT THERE SEEMS TO BE

01:43:37.244 --> 01:43:39.646
A LOT MORE WORK THAT'S NEEDED

01:43:39.713 --> 01:43:41.748
AND LAUDABLE AS IT REALLY

01:43:41.815 --> 01:43:43.350
COMMITTED TO DOING THAT WORK

01:43:43.417 --> 01:43:44.651
AND I THINK ONE OF TE BIGGEST

01:43:44.718 --> 01:43:46.954
CHALLENGES JUST GETTING FUNDING

01:43:47.020 --> 01:43:48.221
TO COVER AT LEAST A PORTION OF

01:43:48.288 --> 01:43:51.124
IT. AND I WOULD SAY SO THE MAIN

01:43:51.191 --> 01:43:53.393
BATTERY ENERGY SOMETIMES A COST

01:43:53.460 --> 01:43:53.860
FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING

01:43:53.927 --> 01:43:55.929
PROVIDERS HAS JUST BEEN. YOU

01:43:55.996 --> 01:43:57.364

MYSTIC OPERATING SYSTEMS. AND

01:44:00.767 --> 01:44:02.469
DAUGHTERS DATA COMMITTEES IS

01:44:02.536 --> 01:44:03.537
JUST PROVIDING A LOT MORE

01:44:03.604 --> 01:44:05.806
FUNDING TO COVER THAT COST WHAT

01:44:05.872 --> 01:44:07.774
IT IS TO COVER GAPS FUNDING.

01:44:07.841 --> 01:44:09.610
AND AS I SAID PANEL UPGRADES

01:44:09.676 --> 01:44:12.212
AND TRANSFORM UPGRADE THROUGH

01:44:12.279 --> 01:44:14.514
EARLY OF COULD THE COST CAME TO

01:44:14.581 --> 01:44:16.116
SURFACE PROJECT APPEARS TO BE

01:44:16.183 --> 01:44:17.618
FEASIBLE AND WILL BE UTILIZED

01:44:17.684 --> 01:44:19.319
THAT. YOU KNOW THEY HAVE TO

01:44:19.386 --> 01:44:20.787
CHANGE THAT PROBLEM WHICH IN A

01:44:20.854 --> 01:44:22.389
LOT OF OLDER PROPERTIES WHICH

01:44:22.456 --> 01:44:24.124
IS A LOT OF EXISTING MULTI

01:44:24.191 --> 01:44:26.727
FAMILY STOCK. IT IS REALLY OLD

01:44:26.793 --> 01:44:28.528
AND FUNDS NEED TO BE UPGRADED

01:44:28.595 --> 01:44:29.997
AND WE'RE SEEING THAT THE COST

01:44:30.063 --> 01:44:31.698
IS JUST JUMPING ALL OVER THE

01:44:31.765 --> 01:44:33.233
PLACE SO WE DON'T HAVE A STEADY

01:44:33.300 --> 01:44:35.135
OP OPERATING UP AND LOOKED AT

01:44:35.202 --> 01:44:38.372
COST. AND WE ARE I THINK. WE

01:44:38.438 --> 01:44:42.242
HEARD IT BEFORE. I THINK REALLY

01:44:42.309 --> 01:44:43.744
ALSO FIGURING OUT YOU'RE NOT AN

01:44:43.810 --> 01:44:45.712
ELECTRIC FRIENDLY IT WOULD

01:44:45.779 --> 01:44:48.782
HELP. HONEST CONSIDER THAT LONG

01:44:48.849 --> 01:44:50.517
TERM OPERATING COST AND SEE

01:44:50.584 --> 01:44:53.120
POSITIVE OUT INCOME FLOW. AND

01:44:53.186 --> 01:44:54.488
THAT COULD REALLY MORE TO READ

01:44:54.554 --> 01:44:55.956
MOTIVATE THEM TO DO SOME OF THE

01:44:56.023 --> 01:44:58.125
WORK. ASK WOULD RESIDENTS I

01:44:58.191 --> 01:44:59.760
THINK THIS IS JUST A VERY

01:44:59.826 --> 01:45:01.294
CRITICAL UPGRADE AND CHANGE

01:45:01.361 --> 01:45:02.963
REQUESTS SPOKE ABOUT IT I THINK

01:45:03.030 --> 01:45:04.398
IT'S NO LONGER A QUESTION OF

01:45:04.464 --> 01:45:05.699
WHETHER WE CAN ELECTION FIVE

01:45:05.766 --> 01:45:07.401
THAT WE CAN. PUT IN SOME OF

01:45:07.467 --> 01:45:08.902
THESE ARE PLANS IS GENERALLY

01:45:08.969 --> 01:45:10.771
ESSENTIAL. FOR YOU KNOW LOW

01:45:10.837 --> 01:45:12.673
INCOME RENTERS TO JUST LIVE IN

01:45:12.739 --> 01:45:14.174
THEIR HOME ESPECIALLY AT A TIME

01:45:14.241 --> 01:45:15.609
LIKE THIS WHERE YOU KNOW GOING

01:45:15.676 --> 01:45:17.844
OUT IS NOT AN OPTION. FOR A LOT

01:45:17.911 --> 01:45:19.212
OF COMMUNITIES BECAUSE OF THE

01:45:19.279 --> 01:45:20.714
HEALTH CARE IS THAT GOING ON

01:45:20.781 --> 01:45:22.416
CLOSES EITHER BY FIRES ON

01:45:22.482 --> 01:45:24.484
MICHAEL WITH. SO A LOT OF.

01:45:24.551 --> 01:45:25.886
RESIDENTS I JUST SPENDING TIME

01:45:25.952 --> 01:45:27.854
MANAGEMENT I THINK. YOU KNOW IF

01:45:27.921 --> 01:45:29.322
THEY'RE NOT DOING THAT I THINGS

01:45:29.389 --> 01:45:30.757
LIKE INSTALLING HEAT BOUNDS OF

01:45:30.824 --> 01:45:36.563
INSTALLING. AT CONDITIONING I

01:45:36.630 --> 01:45:37.631
JUST THINK AND THIS TIME

01:45:37.698 --> 01:45:40.133
THEY'RE JUST FOR THE PAST LOW

01:45:40.200 --> 01:45:42.769
BASS SO I THINK EARLY GOOD

01:45:42.836 --> 01:45:45.539
TRAITS AND REALLY GOOD BATES

01:45:45.605 --> 01:45:47.507
THE WAY FARM TO THAT ACTIVITY

01:45:47.574 --> 01:45:51.278
AND. THEY WERE TRICKED HER PRE

01:45:51.344 --> 01:45:52.379
SHOULD MYSTERY IS ALL GOING BE

01:45:52.446 --> 01:45:54.147
CHAO ACROSS THE BOARD AND

01:45:54.214 --> 01:45:56.316
CERTAINLY PAYING ATTENTION TO

01:45:56.383 --> 01:45:59.252
THE- DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT IT

01:45:59.319 --> 01:46:00.821
COULD HAVE ON LOW INCOME

01:46:00.887 --> 01:46:02.489
FAMILIES AND RENTERS WHO

01:46:02.556 --> 01:46:04.558
CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT WE

01:46:04.624 --> 01:46:05.659
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE

01:46:05.726 --> 01:46:07.594
INTEGRATING PROPERLY IN THE

01:46:07.661 --> 01:46:09.663
MODELING AS WE GO FORWARD- I

01:46:09.730 --> 01:46:13.467
SEE NO OTHER CHERISHED IT'S

01:46:13.533 --> 01:46:15.769
THEIR PANEL JOSH GREEN NOT MASS

01:46:15.836 --> 01:46:18.171
MARRIAGES I JUST WANTED TO

01:46:18.238 --> 01:46:20.974
WEIGH AND- AND ECHO MY FELLOW

01:46:21.041 --> 01:46:24.010
PANELISTS UP REMARKS AS RELATES

01:46:24.077 --> 01:46:26.813
TO A MULTI FAMILY HOUSING- YOU

01:46:26.880 --> 01:46:27.948
KNOW WE OBVIOUSLY HAVE A QUICK

01:46:28.014 --> 01:46:30.317
MATH- THE PUMP- CENTRAL HEAT

01:46:30.383 --> 01:46:32.519
PUMP EQUIPMENT- THAT IS- BEING

01:46:32.586 --> 01:46:35.422
UTILIZED AND MULTI FAMILY-

01:46:35.489 --> 01:46:36.890
INSTALLATIONS NOT ONLY IN

01:46:36.957 --> 01:46:39.459
CALIFORNIA BUT- IN OTHER PARTS

01:46:39.526 --> 01:46:40.727
OF THE COUNTRY AND THERE'S SOME

01:46:40.794 --> 01:46:41.995
OTHER MANUFACTURERS AS WELL

01:46:42.062 --> 01:46:44.598
THAT. I HAVE A QUICK MATH- BUT

01:46:44.664 --> 01:46:46.399
THE UNDERLYING FINANCING AND

01:46:46.466 --> 01:46:48.368
WHEN I HAD REFERENCED- IN MY

01:46:48.435 --> 01:46:50.203
OPENING REMARKS AND THOSE

01:46:50.270 --> 01:46:53.607
INCENTIVES ARE KEY- BECAUSE IT

01:46:53.673 --> 01:46:55.275
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT NASCENT

01:46:55.342 --> 01:46:57.878
TECHNOLOGY BUT ALSO LIMITED- IN

01:46:57.944 --> 01:46:59.546
FIELD APPLICATIONS IN THESE

01:46:59.613 --> 01:47:00.547
INSTALLATIONS SO WE'RE STILL

01:47:00.614 --> 01:47:03.049
LEARNING. RIGHT AS AN INDUSTRY-

01:47:03.116 --> 01:47:04.417
AND ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU THINK

01:47:04.484 --> 01:47:06.887
ABOUT- GREAT ENABLE TECHNOLOGY

01:47:06.953 --> 01:47:08.822
THAT WOULD GO ALONG WITH THESE

01:47:08.889 --> 01:47:11.258
TYPES OF SYSTEMS- ESPECIALLY

01:47:11.324 --> 01:47:14.327
FOR LOAD SHIFTING- THAT- CAN

01:47:14.394 --> 01:47:15.862
CERTAINLY HELP THIS WITHOUT

01:47:15.929 --> 01:47:18.632
WRITTEN BALANCES THE PROVERBIAL

01:47:18.698 --> 01:47:20.634
ETCETERA BUT I JUST WANT TO

01:47:20.700 --> 01:47:21.635
HAVE A CERTAINLY ECHO AND

01:47:21.701 --> 01:47:23.970
REITERATE THAT THE FINANCING

01:47:24.037 --> 01:47:25.372
MECHANISMS AND FLEXIBILITY

01:47:25.438 --> 01:47:27.374
THERE ARE GOING TO BE AN VERY

01:47:27.440 --> 01:47:29.409
IMPORTANT- WE GET A LOT OF

01:47:29.476 --> 01:47:30.443
FEEDBACK IN THIS REGARD

01:47:30.510 --> 01:47:32.846
NATIONALLY WITH- ARCHITECTS

01:47:32.913 --> 01:47:34.481
SPECIFYING ENGINEERS THAT WE

01:47:34.548 --> 01:47:35.382
WORK WITH IN THE COMMERCIAL

01:47:35.448 --> 01:47:38.151
SECTOR- THAT'S KEY AND ONE OF

01:47:38.218 --> 01:47:41.922
THE THINGS. THAT- COMMISSIONER

01:47:41.988 --> 01:47:43.023
CALLOUS THERE TALKED EARLIER ON

01:47:43.089 --> 01:47:43.790
WITH PUBLIC PRIVATE

01:47:43.857 --> 01:47:46.693
PARTNERSHIPS- ONE OF THE THINGS

01:47:46.760 --> 01:47:49.162
THAT WE HAVE BEEN ASKED- TESTS

01:47:49.229 --> 01:47:51.064
TO EXPLORE AND THINK ABOUT. IT

01:47:51.131 --> 01:47:53.333
IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE ENERGY

01:47:53.400 --> 01:47:55.068
SERVICE COMPANY MODEL RIGHT

01:47:55.135 --> 01:47:57.971
ESCO MODEL IN TERMS OF- ENERGY

01:47:58.038 --> 01:48:00.240
EFFICIENCY UPGRADES TO

01:48:00.307 --> 01:48:01.474
BUILDINGS ARE MOSTLY IN THE

01:48:01.541 --> 01:48:02.642
COMMERCIAL SECTOR AND-

01:48:02.709 --> 01:48:04.277
PROVERBIAL MUSH MARKET RIGHT

01:48:04.344 --> 01:48:06.379
NOW A SIMPLE UNIVERSITIES

01:48:06.446 --> 01:48:08.315
SCHOOLS HOSPITALS IS THERE A

01:48:08.381 --> 01:48:11.184
ROLE FOR THAT TYPE OF-

01:48:11.251 --> 01:48:13.653
FINANCING. OF CORPORATE

01:48:13.720 --> 01:48:15.121
PARADIGM FOR MULTI FAMILY

01:48:15.188 --> 01:48:19.726
HOUSING ESPECIALLY FOR- SMALLER

01:48:19.793 --> 01:48:22.329
OWNERS OF MULTI FAMILY HOUSING-

01:48:22.395 --> 01:48:23.630
THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE AN

01:48:23.697 --> 01:48:26.299
INCENTIVIZED- IN TERMS OF A

01:48:26.366 --> 01:48:29.336
LEASING MODEL. SO AGAIN YOU

01:48:29.402 --> 01:48:31.171
KNOW FROM A FROM A MANUFACTURER

01:48:31.238 --> 01:48:33.206
STANDPOINT AND IN THE FIELD

01:48:33.273 --> 01:48:35.375
EXPERIENCE THAT WE HAVE NOW THE

01:48:35.442 --> 01:48:36.810
TECHNOLOGY IS THERE AND IT'S

01:48:36.877 --> 01:48:38.578
BEGINNING TO GROW AND ADAPT AND

01:48:38.645 --> 01:48:45.118
INNOVATE- BUT TO REALLY- MAKE

01:48:45.185 --> 01:48:46.286
UP BREAK AND A MULTI HOUSE IN

01:48:46.353 --> 01:48:49.789
OUR DAUGHTER INCOME TO- WITH

01:48:49.856 --> 01:48:51.258
WITH RENTERS WE'RE GOING TO

01:48:51.324 --> 01:48:53.960
NEED SOME MORE FLEXIBILITY ON

01:48:54.027 --> 01:48:54.995

RECOGNIZE THAT MOST OF THE

01:50:12.872 --> 01:50:13.873
DISCUSSION TODAY HAS BEEN ON

01:50:13.940 --> 01:50:15.475
THE RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL

01:50:15.542 --> 01:50:17.210
BUILDING SECTOR. THERE HAS

01:50:17.277 --> 01:50:20.080
BEEN- REPEATED MENTION- IN THIS

01:50:20.146 --> 01:50:21.147
DISCUSSION AND OTHER

01:50:21.214 --> 01:50:22.682
DISCUSSIONS ARE TAKING PLACE

01:50:22.749 --> 01:50:24.918
ABOUT THE MANUFACTURING. AND

01:50:24.985 --> 01:50:26.720
FOOD PROCESSING SECTOR A SECTOR

01:50:26.786 --> 01:50:28.188
THAT'S OFTEN REFERRED TO AS THE

01:50:28.254 --> 01:50:29.889
HARD TO ELECTRIFY SECTOR

01:50:29.956 --> 01:50:32.425
CALIFORNIA. ANDI REALLY WANT

01:50:32.492 --> 01:50:34.361
TO FOCUS MY COMMENTS ON THAT- I

01:50:34.427 --> 01:50:36.029
NOTICED BIG SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA

01:50:36.096 --> 01:50:37.931
GAS COMPANY HAS CONTINUED TO

01:50:37.998 --> 01:50:39.199
PRESS THE ISSUE OF

01:50:39.265 --> 01:50:39.899
DECARBONISATION OF THE

01:50:39.966 --> 01:50:42.836
PIPELINE. AS A SOLUTION AND I

01:50:42.902 --> 01:50:44.537
THINK I AGREE WITH MR QUIRK

01:50:44.604 --> 01:50:46.072
THAT IT MAY HAVE SOME.

01:50:46.139 --> 01:50:47.340
RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS MAY HAVE

01:50:47.407 --> 01:50:49.275
SOME LIMITED CAPACITY AND

01:50:49.342 --> 01:50:50.276
RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL

01:50:50.343 --> 01:50:53.213
BUILDINGS. IT IS NOT- RENEWABLE

01:50:53.279 --> 01:50:55.815
GAS IS NOT I REPEAT A SOLUTION

01:50:55.882 --> 01:50:57.784
IN THE MANUFACTURING SECTOR.

01:50:57.851 --> 01:51:00.153
RENEWABLE GASES FIVE TO TEN

01:51:00.220 --> 01:51:00.754
TIMES MORE EXPENSIVE

01:51:00.820 --> 01:51:02.555
CONTENTION. CONVENTIONAL FOSSIL

01:51:02.622 --> 01:51:04.457
GAS. AND IT'S JUST NOT AN

01:51:04.524 --> 01:51:06.559
ECONOMIC SOLUTION UNLIKE THE

01:51:06.626 --> 01:51:07.761
GAS COMPANY WE DON'T GET TO

01:51:07.827 --> 01:51:10.330
PASS ON A 100% OF OUR COPS. WE

01:51:10.397 --> 01:51:11.231
CERTAINLY DON'T GET A

01:51:11.297 --> 01:51:12.832
GUARANTEED RATE OF RETURN OF

01:51:12.899 --> 01:51:14.067
10% AND EVERY INVESTMENT YOU'VE

01:51:14.134 --> 01:51:16.202
MADE. IF WE DID WE WOULDN'T BE

01:51:16.269 --> 01:51:17.437
HAVING THIS DISCUSSION RIGHT

01:51:17.504 --> 01:51:19.272
NOW. WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO

01:51:19.339 --> 01:51:20.840
COMPETE AND SO IT'S GOING TO BE

01:51:20.907 --> 01:51:25.211
VERY IMPERATIVE AS. WE MOVE

01:51:25.278 --> 01:51:26.312
DOWN THIS PATH I SINGLE LECTURE

01:51:26.379 --> 01:51:27.647
CASE AND RENEWABLE ARE NOT

01:51:27.714 --> 01:51:28.815
SOLUTIONS IN THE HARD TO

01:51:28.882 --> 01:51:30.750
ELECTRIFY SECTOR BECAUSE OF

01:51:30.817 --> 01:51:32.519
COST AND OTHER CONSIDERATIONS.

01:51:32.585 --> 01:51:33.987
WE NEED TO FIND SOLUTIONS FOR

01:51:34.054 --> 01:51:35.889
THAT SECTOR THAT OUR ECONOMIC

01:51:35.955 --> 01:51:38.425
AN OLD LOVE THE SECTORS TO

01:51:38.491 --> 01:51:38.992
CONTINUE TO PROSPER HERE IN

01:51:39.059 --> 01:51:40.860
CALIFORNIA. I VERY MUCH

01:51:40.927 --> 01:51:42.228
APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO

01:51:42.295 --> 01:51:43.930
SHARE OUR VIEWS HOPEFULLY WE

01:51:43.997 --> 01:51:45.098
CAN MOVE FORWARD WITH THAT

01:51:45.165 --> 01:51:46.433
DISCUSSION RATHER THAN

01:51:46.499 --> 01:51:48.234
CONTINUING TO PLAY THIS GAME.

01:51:48.301 --> 01:51:49.936
THAT RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS AND

01:51:50.003 --> 01:51:51.938
DECARBONISATION PIPELINE IS

01:51:52.005 --> 01:51:54.507
GOING TO BE A- SOLUTION FOR US.

01:51:54.574 --> 01:51:56.576
AND THEN FINALLY ELECTRIC RATES

01:51:56.643 --> 01:51:58.311
ARE MORE THAN DOUBLE P. JUNE

01:51:58.378 --> 01:51:59.913
ELECTRIC RATES ARE QUICKLY

01:51:59.979 --> 01:52:01.147
MOVING TOWARDS THREE TIMES THE

01:52:01.214 --> 01:52:02.916
NATIONAL AVERAGE BUT THE-

01:52:02.982 --> 01:52:04.617
LATEST RATE INCREASE PROPOSALS

01:52:04.684 --> 01:52:06.486
THEY'VE UNVEILED IN THE CONCEPT

01:52:06.553 --> 01:52:08.922
OF UNDERGROUNDING TEN. THOUSAND

01:52:08.988 --> 01:52:09.823
MILES OF THEIR TRANSMISSION

01:52:09.889 --> 01:52:11.491
LINES. WHICH WILL COST AN

01:52:11.558 --> 01:52:12.792
ESTIMATED THIRTY BILLION

01:52:12.859 --> 01:52:14.327
DOLLARS THAT'S THE SAME PRICE

01:52:14.394 --> 01:52:15.462
TAG BUT I THINK YOU HEARD

01:52:15.528 --> 01:52:19.232
PROFESSOR LAURA. PUT ON- THE-

01:52:19.299 --> 01:52:20.233
ELECTRIFICATION OF ALL

01:52:20.300 --> 01:52:22.802
BUILDINGS IN THE STATE SO.

01:52:22.869 --> 01:52:24.437
THAT'S A HUGE CONCERN FOR US

01:52:24.504 --> 01:52:26.005
AND WE NEED TO GET ELECTRICITY

01:52:26.072 --> 01:52:27.040
PRICES UNDER CONTROL AS WELL

01:52:27.107 --> 01:52:31.711
THANK YOU. THANK YOU STE. OUR

01:52:31.778 --> 01:52:32.378
NEXT RECORD. THANK THANK YOU

01:52:32.445 --> 01:52:36.182
WELCOME A YOUR LINE IS OPEN

01:52:36.249 --> 01:52:37.817
THANK YOU GERALDINE ENSURE

01:52:37.884 --> 01:52:39.886
RIVAS- I'M PAUL BREMER WITH THE

01:52:39.953 --> 01:52:41.154
CALIFORNIA BUILDING INDUSTRY

01:52:41.221 --> 01:52:44.791
ASSOCIATION IN BACK IN TWO

01:52:44.858 --> 01:52:45.391
THOUSAND FOURTEEN CBRE

01:52:45.458 --> 01:52:47.227
SPONSORED STUDY THAT LOOKED AT

01:52:47.293 --> 01:52:48.728
THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION

01:52:48.795 --> 01:52:51.131
POTENTIAL OF NEW HOMES VERSUS

01:52:51.197 --> 01:52:53.533
EXISTING HOMES. MY IS THE CIVIC

01:52:53.600 --> 01:52:54.968
LEE- WE LOOKED AT THE

01:52:55.034 --> 01:52:56.536
GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTIONS THAT

01:52:56.603 --> 01:52:58.771
COULD BE MADE FROM A FIVE

01:52:58.838 --> 01:52:59.939
THOUSAND DOLLAR INVESTMENT IN A

01:53:00.006 --> 01:53:02.575
NEW HOME- BUILT IN TWO THOUSAND

01:53:02.642 --> 01:53:04.878
FOURTEEN- VERSUS A SIMILAR HOME

01:53:04.944 --> 01:53:07.247
IT WAS CONSTRUCTED IN NINETEEN

01:53:07.313 --> 01:53:07.914
NINETY AND THE RESULTS WERE

01:53:07.981 --> 01:53:10.083
STUNNING- THE FIVE THOUSAND

01:53:10.150 --> 01:53:11.818
DOLLAR INVESTMENT RESULTED IN

01:53:11.885 --> 01:53:17.223
EIGHT. TIMES THE GHG REDUCTIONS.

01:53:17.290 --> 01:53:17.824
AND THE OLDER HOME THEN IN THE

01:53:17.891 --> 01:53:19.325
NEW ONE. AND KEEP IN MIND THE

01:53:19.392 --> 01:53:21.895
STUDY WAS DONE EIGHT YEARS AGO-

01:53:21.961 --> 01:53:24.664
INTO GERMAN HOLDEN'S POINT- WE

01:53:24.731 --> 01:53:25.632
ONLY LOOKED AT ENERGY

01:53:25.698 --> 01:53:27.500
EFFICIENCY BACK THERE- I

01:53:27.567 --> 01:53:29.202
REALIZE A LECTOR VACATION HAS

01:53:29.269 --> 01:53:30.537
REALLY COME ON STRONG RECENTLY

01:53:30.603 --> 01:53:32.272
BUT- AT THE TIME WE DID THIS

01:53:32.338 --> 01:53:33.973
STUDY WE ONLY LOOKED AT ENERGY

01:53:34.040 --> 01:53:36.509
EFFICIENCY. AND KEEP IN MIND

01:53:36.576 --> 01:53:38.411
ALSO THAT THE CDC HAS UPDATED

01:53:38.478 --> 01:53:40.446
ITS ENERGY RAW STANDARDS THREE

01:53:40.513 --> 01:53:42.482
MORE TIMES- INCLUDING THE

01:53:42.549 --> 01:53:44.083
ROOFTOP SOLAR MANDATE THAT TOOK

01:53:44.150 --> 01:53:46.819
EFFECT. IN JANUARY OF TWENTY

01:53:46.886 --> 01:53:48.855
TWENTY SO- WHY WE'VE YET TO

01:53:48.922 --> 01:53:50.990
UPDATE THE STUDY I IT'S SAFE TO

01:53:51.057 --> 01:53:53.459
ASSUME. THAT THE SAME FIVE

01:53:53.526 --> 01:53:54.027
THOUSAND DOLLAR INVESTMENT

01:53:54.093 --> 01:53:56.029
TODAY WOULD READ FAR GREATER

01:53:56.095 --> 01:53:59.399
RESULTS- THAN IT DID IN TWO

01:53:59.465 --> 01:53:59.999
THOUSAND FOURTEEN NOW CAN WE

01:54:00.066 --> 01:54:02.202
REDO A FURTHER REDUCE GHG

01:54:02.268 --> 01:54:03.336
EMISSIONS A NEW HOMES OF

01:54:03.403 --> 01:54:05.305
COURSE- IT'S JUST GOING TO COST

01:54:05.371 --> 01:54:07.240
A LOT MORE- DUE TO DIMINISHING

01:54:07.307 --> 01:54:09.309
RETURNS. AND IS COMMISSION

01:54:09.375 --> 01:54:10.843
MCALISTER'S ALREADY SAID

01:54:10.910 --> 01:54:13.479
THERE'S ENORMOUS GHG REDUCTION

01:54:13.546 --> 01:54:14.781
POTENTIAL AND THE EXISTING

01:54:14.847 --> 01:54:16.816
BUILDING STOCK- WE ALREADY KNOW

01:54:16.883 --> 01:54:18.318
THAT AND IF THE STAFF IS

01:54:18.384 --> 01:54:22.488
POINTED. OUT IN THEIR-

01:54:22.555 --> 01:54:23.022
BACKGROUND PAPER THERE ARE

01:54:23.089 --> 01:54:24.357
SIMPLE IN VERY LOW THINGS THAT

01:54:24.424 --> 01:54:27.026
CAN BE TO REDUCE GHG EMISSIONS

01:54:27.093 --> 01:54:28.595
AND OLDER HOMES AND APARTMENTS-

01:54:28.661 --> 01:54:30.096
COCKING IN CEILING WINDOWS

01:54:30.163 --> 01:54:32.165
DOORS WALLS- PUTTING IN

01:54:32.232 --> 01:54:33.566
INSULATION WRAP ON THE WATER

01:54:33.633 --> 01:54:35.768
HEATER- AND CHECKING THE DUCKS

01:54:35.835 --> 01:54:38.771
SYSTEM- FOR LEAKS. ALL OF THESE

01:54:38.838 --> 01:54:41.307
ARE VERY LOW COST ITEMS BUT

01:54:41.374 --> 01:54:43.977
HAVE HUGE- REDUCTION POTENTIAL

01:54:44.043 --> 01:54:47.480
BOTH GHG- INTO YOUR ENERGY BILL

01:54:47.547 --> 01:54:48.881
AND REDUCING THE ENERGY BILL OF

01:54:48.948 --> 01:54:50.817
COURSE- MEANS MORE MONEY IN THE

01:54:50.883 --> 01:54:52.919
POCKET FOR THE CONSUMER- AND

01:54:52.986 --> 01:54:54.654
ALSO IS- COMMISSION MCALLISTER

01:54:54.721 --> 01:54:56.623
SAID. A COLLABORATION BETWEEN

01:54:56.689 --> 01:54:58.591
THE STATE AND THE STAKEHOLDERS

01:54:58.658 --> 01:55:00.526
ASSEMBLY KEY TO THE SUCCESS. WE

01:55:00.593 --> 01:55:02.929
NEED TO IMPLEMENT A WAY TO KEEP

01:55:02.996 --> 01:55:04.998
TRACK OF WHAT UPGRADES ARE

01:55:05.064 --> 01:55:06.532
BEING MADE TO THE EXISTING

01:55:06.599 --> 01:55:08.935
BUILDING STOCK- AND PERHAPS DO

01:55:09.002 --> 01:55:10.069
SOMETHING WHAT WE'RE ALREADY

01:55:10.136 --> 01:55:12.372
DOING IN TERMS OF OUR REGISTRY-

01:55:12.438 --> 01:55:13.906
WITH ENERGY EFFICIENCY IN NEW

01:55:13.973 --> 01:55:15.441
HOME CONSTRUCTION. BUT IF WE

01:55:15.508 --> 01:55:18.077
DON'T KEEP TRACK. OF WHAT WE'RE

01:55:18.144 --> 01:55:19.545
DOING IN THE EXISTING HOUSING

01:55:19.612 --> 01:55:21.481
STOCK TEN YEARS DOWN THE ROAD

01:55:21.547 --> 01:55:22.515
WE'RE GONNA BE WONDERING WHERE

01:55:22.582 --> 01:55:23.916
DO WE NEED TO BE- MAKING THE

01:55:23.983 --> 01:55:27.287
CHANGES AND WHAT CHANGES NEED

01:55:27.353 --> 01:55:28.121
TO BE MADE AND LASTLY WE ALSO

01:55:28.187 --> 01:55:29.222
NEED TO ENSURE THAT THE

01:55:29.289 --> 01:55:30.556
UPGRADES TO THE EXISTING

01:55:30.623 --> 01:55:32.492
BUILDINGS ARE CORRECTLY DONE

01:55:32.558 --> 01:55:34.360
AND ARE INSPECTED BY THE LOCAL

01:55:34.427 --> 01:55:35.962
BUILDING DEPARTMENTS. THIS IS

01:55:36.029 --> 01:55:37.630
BEEN ALL HORRIBLE PROBLEM OVER

01:55:37.697 --> 01:55:39.899
THE PAST DECADE- ABOUT TEN

01:55:39.966 --> 01:55:41.334
YEARS AGO- WE HELP THE

01:55:41.401 --> 01:55:43.336
CALIFORNIA BUILDING OFFICIALS-

01:55:43.403 --> 01:55:45.605
DO A SURVEY AND WE FOUND- THAT

01:55:45.672 --> 01:55:47.473
UP TO TEN THOUSAND. AIR

01:55:47.540 --> 01:55:49.208
CONDITIONING UNITS THAT WERE

01:55:49.275 --> 01:55:52.578
SOLD IN THE LA BASIN. FOUR

01:55:52.645 --> 01:55:53.212
HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE HAD PERMITS

01:55:53.279 --> 01:55:53.746
TAKEN OUT WHEN THEY WERE

01:55:53.813 --> 01:55:56.616
INSTALLED THAT'S LESS THAN 5%

01:55:56.683 --> 01:55:58.785
OF THE TOTAL- AND THAT NEEDS TO

01:55:58.851 --> 01:56:00.820
CHANGE SO IN CLOSING C. B. I

01:56:00.887 --> 01:56:02.221
LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING OUR

01:56:02.288 --> 01:56:03.890
