VAPING- BOTH THE BLACK MARKET.

00:43:27.571 --> 00:43:29.006
THERE REALLY HASN'T BEEN

00:43:29.073 --> 00:43:30.841
SIGNIFICANT IMPACT MADE BY LAW

00:43:30.908 --> 00:43:33.344

THAN THEY DID AWAY WITH BEANIE

00:43:39.016 --> 00:43:42.119
SO- I'M JUST TRY TO FIGURE OUT.

00:43:42.186 --> 00:43:43.554
GOING FORWARD WHAT IS A PLANT

00:43:43.620 --> 00:43:46.623
MAGES OFFICE TO DEAL WITH THAT.

00:43:46.690 --> 00:43:47.825

OF- LIKE TRONIC CIGARETTES AS

00:43:55.499 --> 00:43:58.335
WELL- THERE WAS I THINK A FAIR

00:43:58.402 --> 00:44:00.137
AMOUNTOF PUBLICITY ASSOCIATED

00:44:00.204 --> 00:44:01.438
WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S

00:44:01.505 --> 00:44:03.741
DECISION TO SUE JEWEL. FOR A

00:44:03.807 --> 00:44:06.643
VARIETY OF- VIOLATIONS OF STATE

00:44:06.710 --> 00:44:10.814
LAW WE DID THAT IN NOVEMBER WE

00:44:10.881 --> 00:44:14.051
ARE ALWAYS. TRIED IN AN

00:44:14.118 --> 00:44:16.620
EFFICIENT WAY TO- ENFORCE THE

00:44:16.687 --> 00:44:18.188
APPLICABLE LAWS AGAINST ALL

00:44:18.255 --> 00:44:19.590
TOBACCO PRODUCTS BUT ON THE

00:44:19.656 --> 00:44:20.924
VAPING ISSUES MOST OF IT IS NOT

00:44:20.991 --> 00:44:23.360
COMING FROM JEWEL BLACK MARKET.

00:44:23.427 --> 00:44:24.795
CANNABIS ANOTHER BLACK MARKET

00:44:24.862 --> 00:44:26.397
PRODUCTS THAT'S THAT'S THE CRUX

00:44:26.463 --> 00:44:29.767
OF THE PROBLEM CORRECT. WELL WE

00:44:29.833 --> 00:44:31.568
SOON ACTUAL BECAUSE WE HAVE A

00:44:31.635 --> 00:44:33.337
GOOD FAITH BELIEF THAT JEWEL

00:44:33.404 --> 00:44:35.806
HAS OPERATED OUT OF COMPLIANCE

00:44:35.873 --> 00:44:37.708
WITH A NUMBER OF CALIFORNIA

00:44:37.775 --> 00:44:40.344
LAWS THAT SAID THERE CERTAINLY

00:44:40.411 --> 00:44:42.946
ARE OTHER ENTITIES THAT ARE

00:44:43.013 --> 00:44:45.883
SELLING. TOBACCO PRODUCTS

00:44:45.949 --> 00:44:48.252
INCLUDING VAPING PRODUCTS-

00:44:48.318 --> 00:44:49.720
WITHOUT FULLY COMPLIED WITH

00:44:49.787 --> 00:44:51.522
CALIFORNIA LAW AND WE CONTINUE

00:44:51.588 --> 00:44:54.058
TO LOOK INTO ALL THAT ACTIVITY.

00:44:54.124 --> 00:44:55.793
MY HOPE IS THAT WE JUST TO DO A

00:44:55.859 --> 00:44:56.927
BETTER JOB OBVIOUSLY THE AG'S

00:44:56.994 --> 00:44:59.129

00:44:59.196 --> 00:45:01.165
THEIR LOT TO JUGGLE AND THE

00:45:01.231 --> 00:45:02.499
LOCALS THERE DOWN TO GROUND

00:45:02.566 --> 00:45:03.500
LEVEL THEY KNOW THAT THEIR

00:45:03.567 --> 00:45:05.269
THEIR NEIGHBORHOODS MISS FOSTER

00:45:05.335 --> 00:45:06.770
DOING SAID LEAD TO SEE MORE

00:45:06.837 --> 00:45:08.238
PUSH DOWN IT REALLY TIRESOME

00:45:08.305 --> 00:45:10.407
THESE FOLKS. THAT ARE MAKING A

00:45:10.474 --> 00:45:12.943
LOT OF MONEY OFF THESE. THE

FORFEITURE. AS IS THE EIGHTY

00:45:16.914 --> 00:45:19.650
THOUGHT ABOUT REALLY. DOING

THAT ARE GOING AFTER HIM THE

00:45:21.185 --> 00:45:22.519
SUBSTANTIAL WAY BECAUSE RIGHT

NOW THE FINES ARE VERY

00:45:23.253 --> 00:45:26.790

ASCERTAIN- THE- APPLICABLE LAWS

00:46:00.924 --> 00:46:01.358

OF CIGARETTES IN VAPING I'M I

00:46:22.813 --> 00:46:24.982

IN THE- AND THE SUBMISSIONS

00:46:32.890 --> 00:46:34.591
RIGHT NOW TO MAKE THIS ACTUALLY

EASIER FOR THE AG TO ENFORCE.

00:46:37.227 --> 00:46:38.529
AT THE END OF THE DAY A LOT OF

HAVE ONLY SO MANY AGENTS. THEY

00:46:52.309 --> 00:46:52.843
CAN GO OUT OF FORCE THESE LAWS

00:46:52.910 --> 00:46:54.511
AND DEAL WITH THIS SO. I JUST

00:46:54.578 --> 00:46:59.850

STREAMLINE ALL OF THAT AND

00:47:02.586 --> 00:47:07.891
ULTIMATELY. IF. OKAY ANY OTHER

00:47:07.958 --> 00:47:12.095
QUESTIONS MEMBERS. MR GALLAGHER

00:47:12.162 --> 00:47:12.629
LOOKS LIKE HE HAS A BRIEF

00:47:12.696 --> 00:47:17.000
QUESTION. YOUNG MY CAN MY

00:47:17.067 --> 00:47:17.768
CONCERN IS I MEAN CERTAINLY IS

00:47:17.834 --> 00:47:19.336
A GOOD PROGRAM- BUT I DON'T

00:47:19.403 --> 00:47:21.171
KNOW THERE'S BEEN A SUFFICIENT

00:47:21.238 --> 00:47:23.307
JUSTIFICATION FOR MOVING IT

00:47:23.373 --> 00:47:24.374
FROM THE FIRE MARSHALL TO THE

00:47:24.441 --> 00:47:27.044
AG'S OFFICE. AND LOOKED QUITE

00:47:27.110 --> 00:47:28.378
FRANKLY THE AG'S OFFICE IS

00:47:28.445 --> 00:47:30.247
HAVING A TROUBLE DOING THE

00:47:30.314 --> 00:47:30.847
THINGS THAT IS ALREADY TASKED

00:47:30.914 --> 00:47:33.183
WITH DOING PRIMARILY GETTING

00:47:33.250 --> 00:47:34.918
GUNS OUT OF THE HANDS OF FELONS

00:47:34.985 --> 00:47:36.954
AND OTHER PROHIBITED PERSONS.

00:47:37.020 --> 00:47:38.689
IS STILL WAY BEHIND ON THAT AND

00:47:38.755 --> 00:47:39.723
I WOULD MUCH RATHER SEE THEIR

00:47:39.790 --> 00:47:41.658
ATTENTION FOCUSED ON THE

00:47:41.725 --> 00:47:42.859
IMPORTANT ITEMS THAT HAS BEEN

00:47:42.926 --> 00:47:46.230
TASKED WITH AS OF TODAY RATHER

00:47:46.296 --> 00:47:47.631
THAN ADDING A PROGRAM AND I

00:47:47.698 --> 00:47:49.132
THINK IS- ASSEMBLY MEMBER

00:47:49.199 --> 00:47:50.534
COOPER IS POINTED OUT. THERE'S

00:47:50.601 --> 00:47:51.468
STILL A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS

00:47:51.535 --> 00:47:53.370
THAT NEED TO BE. I THINK FULLY

00:47:53.437 --> 00:47:55.105
FLESHED OUT BEFORE WE JUST HAND

00:47:55.172 --> 00:47:58.175
OVER- THIS PROGRAM I MEAN THERE

00:47:58.242 --> 00:48:00.577
IS THE- BLACK MARKET THE NO

00:48:00.644 --> 00:48:02.546
CANNABIS AS WELL WHAT'S GOING

00:48:02.613 --> 00:48:04.181
ON IN THE ENFORCEMENT OF THOSE

00:48:04.248 --> 00:48:06.817
THINGS- I THINK THE DISCUSSION

00:48:06.883 --> 00:48:08.418
ABOUT ASSETS ASSET FORFEITURE

00:48:08.485 --> 00:48:11.655
IS A GOOD ONE- AND SHOULD MAYBE

00:48:11.722 --> 00:48:13.557
BE PART OF THIS AS WELL- SO I

00:48:13.624 --> 00:48:14.758
DON'T I DON'T KNOW THAT I'M

00:48:14.825 --> 00:48:16.159
READY TO JUST. SAY YEAH LET'S

00:48:16.226 --> 00:48:17.961
GO AHEAD AND HAND OVER THIS

00:48:18.028 --> 00:48:18.829
PROGRAM WHEN AGAIN I DON'T

00:48:18.895 --> 00:48:19.896
THINK THERE'S BEEN THE

00:48:19.963 --> 00:48:21.798
SUFFICIENT SUFFICIENT

00:48:21.865 --> 00:48:23.267
JUSTIFICATION OR YOU KNOW THE

00:48:23.333 --> 00:48:26.103
BACKGROUND. AS TO HOW THIS

00:48:26.169 --> 00:48:26.670
COULD ALL WORK VERY

00:48:26.737 --> 00:48:28.839
COMPREHENSIVELY- IN THE AG'S

00:48:28.905 --> 00:48:34.678
OFFICE. APPARENTLY MR GARGAN I

00:48:34.745 --> 00:48:35.279
HAVE DIFFERENT DEFINITIONS OF

00:48:35.345 --> 00:48:42.386
BRIEF. MR BIGELOW. AND SO

00:48:42.452 --> 00:48:43.020
MISTER CHAIRMAN IF I CAN REALLY

00:48:43.086 --> 00:48:46.890
BRIEFLY- HAVE REALLY BRIEFLY I

00:48:46.957 --> 00:48:47.958
YOU KNOW I THINK ONE THING

00:48:48.025 --> 00:48:49.593
THAT'S BEEN OVERLOOKED IS- WITH

00:48:49.660 --> 00:48:52.629
THIS BILL- ME- I APPRECIATE THE

00:48:52.696 --> 00:48:55.065
CONCERNS ABOUT EFFICIENCIES-

00:48:55.132 --> 00:48:57.334
BUT CERTAINLY MODERNIZATION IS

00:48:57.401 --> 00:48:59.002
SOMETHING THAT I CARE ABOUT AND

00:48:59.069 --> 00:48:59.803
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE CURRENT

00:48:59.870 --> 00:49:01.772
PROCESS THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL

00:49:01.838 --> 00:49:04.608
HAS A PAPER FORM AND MANUALLY

00:49:04.675 --> 00:49:06.910
ENTERS MOST OF THIS DATA TO A

00:49:06.977 --> 00:49:08.779
SPREADSHEET AND SO THE IDEA

00:49:08.845 --> 00:49:10.714
BEHIND THIS IS THAT WHEN THE

00:49:10.781 --> 00:49:12.349
ATTORNEY GENERAL SHOULD ASSUME

00:49:12.416 --> 00:49:13.483
THIS RESPONSIBILITY. AND

00:49:13.550 --> 00:49:14.785
ADMINISTER THIS PROGRAM THEY

00:49:14.851 --> 00:49:17.587
WILL USE AN ELECTRONIC FORM-

00:49:17.654 --> 00:49:19.256
AND SO IN THE LONG TERM WE CAN

00:49:19.323 --> 00:49:22.759
BE CREATING IT IN EFFICIENCY-

00:49:22.826 --> 00:49:23.994
THAT IS GOING TO BE A HUGE

00:49:24.061 --> 00:49:26.396
BENEFIT FOR THIS ENTIRE PROCESS

00:49:26.463 --> 00:49:30.834
FOR STATE FOR TAXPAYERS- AND SO

00:49:30.901 --> 00:49:31.468
NAY APPRECIATE THE CONCERNS BUT

00:49:31.535 --> 00:49:32.069
I THINK THAT THIS IS A STEP IN

00:49:32.135 --> 00:49:35.005
THE RIGHT DIRECTION. WELL WE

00:49:35.072 --> 00:49:35.605
ALSO GOT A WORK ON BIRD MISTER

00:49:35.672 --> 00:49:37.040

KIND OF TRAILS AND WHAT'S BEING

00:49:40.210 --> 00:49:42.179

OFFICE HAS BEEN UNABLE TO

00:49:52.289 --> 00:49:53.256
REALLY PERFORM DOING THIS

00:49:53.323 --> 00:49:54.558
BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF FUNDING

00:49:54.624 --> 00:49:56.593
WITH RESPECT TO THIS YOU ALSO

00:49:56.660 --> 00:49:58.328

TO REVIEW A NUMBER THE

00:50:00.797 --> 00:50:02.032
