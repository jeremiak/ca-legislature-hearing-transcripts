ANY PROCEEDINGS REGARDING THE JUDICIAL REVIEW IF SENATOR ALAN MENTION WOULD HAVE TO BE REQUIRED TO BE RESOLVED WITHIN TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY DAYS WE UNDERSTAND IT ENSURING EQUITY IMPROVING AIR QUALITY AND PROVIDING ENVIRONMENTAL MITIGATIONS AND ROBUST PUBLIC OUTREACH ARE ESSENTIAL TOOLS TO SUCCESSFUL TRANSIT PROJECT DELIVERY THEY'RE ALSO VITAL ELEMENTS IN IN SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETING THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROCESS. UNFORTUNATELY COSTLY LITIGATION DELAYS AND PROJECT THROUGH THE PROJECT ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW PUT APPROVAL PROCESS DELAY PROJECT DELIVERY AND STALL THE IMPORTANT IMPROVEMENTS IN BENEFITS THAT THESE PROJECTS BRING.

WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEE STAFF EXCELLENT ANALYSIS AND SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS APPRECIATE HEARING THAT THE AUTHOR IS PLANNING ON TAKING THOSE AMENDMENTS UNFORTUNATELY WE ARE STILL OPPOSE THE BILL HOWEVER BECAUSE UNTIL IT IS AMENDED TO REMOVE THE TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY DAY. EXPEDITED JUDICIAL REVIEW PROVISION- THAT PROVISION. FIRESTICK WHAT CASE- SOMETHING TO THIS BILL INCLUDING APPEALED CONCLUDE.

SO FOR THOSE REASONS- DID USUALLY HELPFUL. REMAIN OPPOSED TO THE BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS GOOD MORNING MADAM. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS HI THIS IS RICHARD MARCUSSEN WITH THE WESTERN ELECTRICAL CONTRACTORS ASSOCIATION AND LIKE THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL WE HAVE NARAL OBJECTIONS TO PROVISIONS IN THE BILL. SB FORTY FOUR MAYBE A COMPLETELY LEGITIMATE PUBLIC POLICY BUT IS THE MEDIA HAS POINTED OUT RECENTLY AUTHORS WHO WANT TO ACCELERATE HOUSING. SEARCHES UNDER ALLEN ARE FORCED TO ACCEPT AMENDMENTS THAT CAN SUPPORT THE BEST POLICY INTENTIONS MAKE CONSTRUCTION MORE EXPENSIVE THAN ACTUALLY REDUCE EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR OTHERWISE QUALIFIED CONSTRUCTION WORKERS WHO ARE FORCED OUT OF WORK BECAUSE THEY HAVE NOT GRADUATED FROM A- CALIFORNIA APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM. THIS IS BECAUSE THE CONSTRUCTION UNIONS INSIST ON LANGUAGE LIKE THAT IN SB FORTY FOUR THAT MANDATES MINIMUM GRADUATION RATIOS ELIMINATES CERTIFIED PAYROLL RECORDS IN CERTAIN CASES AND BARS THE STATE LABOR COMMISSIONER FROM PROTECTING CONSTRUCTION WORKERS ON CERTAIN PROJECTS. AUTHORS WHO RESIST THESE PROVISIONS WILL SEE THEIR BILLS FAIL. AND ARE SOMETIMES PILLORIED BY THE PROPONENTS OF SKILLED AND TRAINED AND THERE'S NEVER BEEN ANY EVIDENCE THAT THIS POLICY THAT ORIGINATED WITH REFINERY TURNAROUNDS. ACTUALLY REDUCES INJURY IMPROVES QUALITY REDUCES COSTS EVEN COMES SOME CONSTRUCTION UNIONS QUESTION SKILLED AND TRAINED WHICH IS WHY CARPENTRY MASONRY OPERATING ENGINEERS AND THEIR RELATED SUBGRAPHS. CAPPED THEIR GRADUATION REQUIREMENTS 30% AND TEAMSTERS ARE COMPLETELY EXEMPT. SUPPORTERS ALTERNATELY SAY THE SKILLED AND TRAINED EITHER IMPROVE SAFETY OR INCREASES LOCAL HIRE ONE LEGISLATOR EVEN DECRIED SING VEHICLES WITH MEXICAN LICENSE PLATES AT SOME CONSTRUCTION SITES BUT THERE'S ZERO EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THESE CLAIMS. IT MAY BEHOOVE THE LEGISLATURE TO IMPOSE A MORATORIUM ON NEW SKILLED AND TRAINED MANDATES UNLESS AND UNTIL THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT ADDS VALUE TO CONSTRUCTION. AT THE VERY LEAST WE SUGGEST THAT YOU STOP NEW STATUTES THAT BAR THE STATE LABOR COMMISSIONER FROM PROTECTING CONSTRUCTION WORKERS THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU- NOW WE'RE READY FOR TESTIMONY FROM ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN. EITHER SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION ALL START WITH ANYONE IN THE HEARING ROOM. SEEN NONE OF REMOTE TESTIMONY LOCATION I DON'T SEE ANY MODERATOR CAN YOU PLEASE OPEN UP THE LINES FOR WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION.

MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS JOSHUA SHOP FOR THE SOLANO TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY IN SUPPORT OF SB FORTY FOUR THANK YOU. THERE S NO ONE ELSE TO SIGNAL BUT THEY WISH TO SPEAK THANK YOU NOW BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. OKAY ASSEMBLY MEMBER C. R. TELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS YET ANOTHER STREAMLINING PROCESS AND YOU'LL FIND THAT I AM SUPPORTIVE OF. ANYTHING WE CAN DO TO STREAMLINED PROCESS HE'S SO THAT PROJECTS THAT OUR PUBLIC BENEFIT WHICH JUST ABOUT INCLUDES EVERY PROJECT THAT GETS BUILT OTHERWISE IT WOULDN'T BE BILL. GETS DONE- I DO NOT AGREE WITH A LOT OF YOU KNOW SOME OF THE ANCILLARY THINGS THAT ARE IN HERE. HOWEVER I AGREE WITH THE TRYING TO STREAMLINE THE PROCESS BECAUSE THERE'S A PROPOSED PUBLIC THE TRANSIT PROJECTS THAT ARE INCLUDED IN HERE ARE. SUBSTANTIALLY IMPORTANT- TO THE BETTERMENT OF THAT PEOPLE'S LIVES THAT LIVE IN THOSE AREAS- THAT ARE AFFECTED BY THE LACK OF TRANSPORTATION- HOWEVER I DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO THINK IT'S A GREEN LIGHT AND I AGREE. I DID THAT BECAUSE I THINK THIS SHOULD BE DONE FOR EVERY PROJECT. BECAUSE FOR ME- WHEN YOU LOOK AT A COSTCO THAT GETS BUILT AND THEN HAS TO GO THROUGH A THREE YEAR LAWSUIT PROCESS BECAUSE THE SEQUEL- THERE THE PUBLIC BENEFIT TO THAT AREA IT THAT'S BEING LOST OUR JOBS- AIR QUALITY- WELL YOU KNOW JUST YOU NAME IT- AND YET. WE KEEP CARVING OUT FOR SPECIFIC. SPECIFIC GREEN THINGS BUT WE DON'T CARVE OUT FOR WE DON'T CREATE A PROCESS THAT IS ACTUALLY. BENEFICIAL. TODAY AND BECAUSE OF THAT BECAUSE IT STREAMLINES THE PROCESS IS BROKEN. AND AND I APPRECIATE YOU RECOGNIZING THAT IT IS BROKING AND BRING IT TO US. AND THAT WHILE IT IS KINDA NARROWED- I THINK ESPECIALLY IN LA'S CASE RIGHT NOW- WE NEED TO BE FOCUSED ON NOT GETTING THIS PROJECT DONE SO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING. THE SIMPSONS. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS HEY WE DON'T YET HAVE A QUORUM SO WE WILL VOTE ON THIS- AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME BUT WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE MY APPRECIATE APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS THE TESTIMONY APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS ASSEMBLY MEMBER- I WILL JUST SAY IT TO THE GENTLEMAN FROM THE CONTRACT ASSOCIATION AT THESE ARE. MASSIVE TRANSIT PROJECT IS NOT A HOUSING. BILL YOU KNOW I DON'T DISAGREE WITH SOME OF THE THINGS HE SAID WITH REGARDS TO THE- YOU KNOW THE BATTLE CURRENTLY UNDER WAY OVER OVER AND- YOU KNOW SOME OF THE LANGUAGE THAT. THAT HAS BEEN ADDED INTO VARIOUS BILLS BUT THE THESE ARE. AS WAS MENTIONED BY THE FOLKS MILLION AFTER THESE ARE THESE ARE BIG TRANSIT PROJECTS ALL OF THEM ARE BEING DONE BY PLA'S- SO- YOU KNOW. I'M NOT SURE THE HIS COMMISSARY PLIED TO THE KIND OF THINGS WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS HERE THIS BILL BUT- RESEARCHER YOUR RECOGNIZING WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND- AND- RESPECT YESTERDAY BUT WHEN THE TIME COMES. THANK YOU ALL RIGHT TODAY SHOVEL THE NEXT YES NEXT IS ITEM TWO SB EIGHTY THREE OKAY THANK YOU. HI THIS IS ANOTHER BILL- THAT- THIS RECEIVE STRONG BIPARTISAN SUPPORT- OVER IN THE SENATE- AND I THINK IT'S IT WAS RECOGNIZED BY THE SENATOR GROWTH HI I WAS A BILL THAT IS PERMISSIVE IT PROVIDES A VERY INTERESTING TOOL TO CITIES THAT ARE CURRENTLY REALLY STRUGGLING WITH- WITH ALL THE POLITICS ASSOCIATED WITH SEA LEVEL RISE SO LET ME GET INTO THIS- BUT LET ME START BY AT A VERY EXPRESS MY APPRECIATION AND MY ACCEPTANCE OF THE NIGHT OF THE AMENDMENTS SUGGESTED THE ANALYSIS THE ODD MORE SPECIFICITY. TO HELP US AROUND OUT THE PROGRAM AND I THINK THEY ALSO WHAT I REALLY I WAS TELLING MY STAFF ACTUALLY I'VE READ OVER THE MEN'S OF THESE ARE REALLY GOOD AMENDMENTS BECAUSE THEY- THEY- PAY FORCE. ANALYSIS YOU KNOW WE ALREADY HAVE A LIMIT OF IT BUT IT REALLY FOCUSES IN ON. THE IMPORTANCE OF OUR- INSURING THAT THIS DOESN'T LOSE ANY MONEY. FOR THE STATE OR FOR THE PUBLIC PURSE THE COST EFFECTIVENESS. THE PUBLIC BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH BUYING A PROPERTY AND ALSO. THE EXTENT TO WHICH- IT'S PART OF A- OF A OF A OF A LOCAL REGIONAL PLAN THAT'S COHERENT AND- IS- COME MORE COHERENTLY ADDRESSING THE IMPACTS OF SEA LEVEL RISE SO WE'RE SEEING SEA LEVEL RISE AS AN ISSUE. I'VE BEEN DOWN THE STATE OUR LA TIMES THAT A FASCINATING- SPECIAL SECTION ON THIS ISSUE- THE L. A. O. ESTIMATES AROUND EIGHT TO TEN BILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF EXISTING PROPERTIES LIKELY TO BE UNDER WATER BY TWENTY FIFTY. WHICH IS WILD TO THINK ABOUT MORE THAN A HUNDRED FIFTY BILLION DOLLARS IN PROPERTY COULD BE AT RISK OF FLOODING. BY- TWENTY BY. YEAH TWENTY ONE HUNDRED IS THAT THE AND HOW WAS IT- THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE LOOKING FOR WAYS TO ADDRESS THIS CRISIS- BOUNCING VERY LIMITED BUDGETS WITH FEW GOOD OPTIONS WITH THE NEEDS OF HOMEOWNERS. SO WHAT YOU'RE SEEING IS THE YOU HAVE AREAS THAT ARE ALREADY EXPERIENCING FLOODING THAT THE C. IS STARTING TO- TO RISE. AND- THE MORE FIND A COURSE THAT BUYING OUT LOCAL RESIDENTS RELOCATING THEM IT'S BEEN VERY CONTROVERSIAL IN SOME INSTANCES COST PROHIBITIVE- SO THERE'S A LOT OF POLITICS IN THESE TOWNS THOUGH RIGHT THE LOCAL HOMEOWNERS COME TO THE CITY COUNCIL THEY SAY YOU GET USED TO SPEND EVERY WAKING HOUR DOING EVERYTHING YOU POSSIBLY CAN SPENDING EVERY LAST DIME OF THE CITY BUDGET TO PROTECT MY HOME AND YOU CAN SEE WHY PEOPLE DO THAT THIS IS THEIR HOME IF SOMETHING THAT NEED IS INCREDIBLY MEANINGFUL TO THEM. AND CITIES ARE NOW FACED WITH THESE INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT CHOICES WHETHER HAVING TO CHOOSE BETWEEN BUIDING PUTTING MORE MONEY INTO A SEA WALL WHICH KEEPS COLLAPSING- TO PROTECT IT A STRETCH OF BEACH OF THE INSPECTOR HOME'S OR YOU SEE THAT MONEY GO TO THE FIRE DEPARTMENT OR TO YOU KNOW THE PARKS OR OR OR OTHER IMPORTANT LOCAL SERVICES. SO THIS IS THE THIS IS THE IN FACT THE TIMES HAD A LITTLE CHART WHERE YOU COULD FOLLOW THE DIFFICULT DECISION MAKING OF A CITY COUNCIL MEMBER TRYING TO BALANCE THE INTENSE LOCAL POLITICAL NEEDS YOUR BUDGETARY NEEDS. IT'S SUCH A- SO WHAT WITH THE IDEA HERE- IS THAT AND IF YOU THINK ABOUT THAT THE COST IN LIVES AND TREASURE THE COULD HAVE BEEN SAVED OF CALIFORNIA TAKING MORE ACTION DECADES AGO. AND TO BETTER MITIGATE AGAINST- THE THREAD OF DEVASTATING WILDFIRES. WHAT IF WE CREATE A FIND. A PERMISSIVE. THAT WOULD PROVIDE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WITH THE FINANCING OPTION. TO ALLEVIATE THE RISKS OF SEA LEVEL RISE WHILE PROTECTING BOTH PROPERTY OWNERS AND TAXPAYERS SO THE IDEA IS IT'S A REVOLVING LOAN FUND. IT WITH BASICALLY WOULD GO FOR THE MONEY WOULD GO TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO BUY PROPERTIES THAT WILL BE THREATENED IN IN A DECADE OR TWO. ARE THEY CAN ALLOW THE OWNERS TO SELL WHILE THE HOUSE STILL HAS VALUE. AND OF COURSE THESE ARE VERY OFTEN IS VERY ATTRACTIVE PROPERTIES RIGHT ON THE WATER. AND THEN THE GOT THE GOVERNMENT ENTITY CAN RENT OUT THE PROPERTYREPAYING THE LOAN. IN SOME CASES POTENTIALLY EVEN EARNING REVENUE. AND OF COURSE WE GET ONE OF THE KEY AMENDMENTS AT THE COMMITTEE ACCESS TO TAKE WAS THAT WE REALLY DO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S- THERE'S THE OTHER THIS THAT THE T. THIS PROCESS WILL GENERATE ENOUGH REVENUE TO REPAY THE LOAN BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT THIS TO BE A NET LOSS. TO TAXPAYERS MAYBE IN SOME CASES IT COULD EVEN BE A GAME. SO THEN WHEN THE PROPERTY IS THAT IT RISK. OF OF FLOODING FROM RISING SEA LEVELS IN THE HOUSE COULD BE DEMOLISHED OR RELOCATED. WITHOUT LOCAL RESIDENTS OR TAXPAYERS DURING THE COST. AND WITHOUT THE INCREDIBLE POLITICAL UPHEAVAL. AND THE AND THE IMPOSSIBLE SOPHIE'S CHOICES. THAT CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS ARE CURRENTLY BEING ASKED TO MAKE- IN CITIES UP AND DOWN THE STATE. TOTALLY PERMISSIVE. AND WE WERE STRUCTURE IN A WAY THAT IT WOULD BE EITHER COST NEUTRAL OR- OR OR HOPEFULLY A BENEFICIAL. SO I HAVE WITH ME TODAY JENNIFER SAVAGE WITH THE SURFRIDER FOUNDATION IN ISABELLA GONZALES POTTER WITH THE NATURE CONSERVANCY TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF ON BY WE WANNA SEE PERMISSIVE NOT JUST PERMISSIVE FOR THE CITY LIGHTS. BUT NO HOMEOWNER WOULD HAVE TO DO THIS IF THEY DON'T WANT TO RIGHTS OF A HOMEOWNER DECIDES THEY WANT TO STICK IT OUT IN THEIR HOME THERE'S NOTHING IN THIS BILL ACTUALLY NOTHING IN THIS BILL THAT WOULD REQUIRE THEM. TO SELL SO WITHOUT A LEFT TURN TO MY WITNESSES JENNIFER AND DIES ABOUT. THANK YOU SENATOR. OF BEFORE WE- HEAR THE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT- I'D LIKE TO ASK SECRETARY TO CALL ROLE WE HAVE A QUORUM. NO WE DON'T. TWO THREE. FIVE FIVE. NEED SIX OH I THOUGHT WE NEED TO FIVE OKAY. OKAY OKAY THEN I WILL DO THAT. OKAY THEN LET'S A MODERATOR CAN YOU PLEASE OPEN THE LINE FOR WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS THE SORT OF ON TALIBAN IN THE POLICY ASSOCIATE WITH THE NATURE CONSERVANCY- IN AN EFFORT TO BE A SHORT ON TIME HERE IN AVOID REDUNDANCIES AND SENATOR ALAN GIVE US THE TICKET OPENING ALL TRY TO KEEP MY REMARKS PRETTY SHORT. OF THE NATURE CONSERVANCY STRONGLY SUPPORTS SB EIGHTY THREE- SOME INTERESTING STATISTICS THAT I'D LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT IS THAT WITH THE PACIFIC OCEAN PROJECTED TO RISE NINE FEET IN SOME COASTAL AREAS OF CALIFORNIA BY TWENTY ONE HUNDRED WE NEED TO TAKE ACTION. TO PROTECT THE ENTIRE COAST WE ELEVEN DEPEND ON WHETHER DEVELOPED OR WILD WE MUST ALSO HELP OUR COMMUNITY THE LEVY EIGHT THE RISK OF RISING OCEAN LEVELS WHILE PROTECTING BOTH PROPERTY OWNERS AND NATURE. TNCS RECENT SCIENCE REPORT SHOWS 55% OF CALIFORNIA COASTAL HABITAT IN JEOPARDY FOR SEALABLE RIGHT THAT FIFTY FIVE PERCENT. WE BELIEVE THAT SB EIGHTY THREE WILL BE AN IMPORTANT TOOL TO HELP ADDRESS THE CLIMATE IMPACTS TO HABITAT IN THE STATE FUNDING COULD BE PRIORITIZED TO PROPERTIES THAT PROVIDE MULTI BENEFITS INCLUDING PROTECTING COASTAL HABITAT PROTECTING EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE OR PROTECTING PARKS AND OTHER OPEN SPACES- CALIFORNIA MUST ACT TO PROTECT COASTAL COMMUNITIES FROM CLIMATE CHANGE IN SB EIGHTY THREE DEMONSTRATES A NEW APPROACH TO ADDRESS THE AUTHORIZED- AND ADDS SENATOR ALLEN HAS NOTED IT HAD ENJOYED SOME BIPARTISAN SUPPORT. SO WE pLEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE AND URGE YOUR SUPPORT. FOR THE BILL TODAY THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MADAME CHIANG KAI MEMBERS JENNIFER. CALIFORNIA POLICY MANAGER FOR THE THIRD FOUNDATION. SURFRIDER THE NONPROFIT OR- THAT TO BEACH ACCESS AND COOK TO PRESERVATION. AND AS YOU HAVE HEARD THE CONSEQUENCES OF FAILING TO ADAPT IF YOU'LL RIDE TO BE PROFOUNDLY DAMAGING TO CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY OUR COASTAL COMMUNITIES. ARE INLAND COMMUNITIES RESIDENTS RELY ON THE BEACH TO ESCAPE SUMMER HEAT. AND TO OUR MARINE ENVIRONMENT. INTERCRATER STATED WITH EACH REPORT CALIFORNIA IS THE ONLY STATE THAT RENDON AND BECAUSE OF PRESERVATION PLANNING. SO WHILE THE STATE INTENTIONS WITHOUT EMPOWERING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO IMPLEMENT PROACTIVE ADAPTATION WE WILL BE WITH OUR BEACHES. EVEN THE MOST PROACTIVE JURISDICTIONS ARE CURRENTLY FAR BEHIND WHERE THEY NEED TO BE THIS IS LARGELY A RESULT OF NOT HAVING ENOUGH FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO PLAN APPROPRIATELY. AND WHEN YOU ADD IN THE OFTEN FRAUGHT NTURE OF LOCAL POLITICS. IT'S EASY TO SEE HOW CITIES AND COUNTIES ARE LEFT WITH FEW AGREEABLE OPTIONS REGARDING HOW TO HELP COOK THE PROPERTY OWNERS THE JACK IF YOU LOVE A CONTINUE TO RISE. THIS RESULT IN CONSTANT CONFLICT BETWEEN STATE GUIDANCE AND WHAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE WILLING AND ABLE TO DEAL. SB EIGHTY THREE WITH ALLEVIATE THE CONTENT BY ESTABLISHING A FUND FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT. AND INCREASE THEIR ABILITY TO STRATEGIZE IN WAYS NECESSARY TO PRESERVING CALIFORNIA POLITICOS AND MAINTAINING COASTAL ACCESS EQUITY INTO THE FUTURE. IT'S A TRULY FORWARD THINKING BILL IN A TIME WHEN LONG TERM PLANNING HAS BEEN IN SHORT BY. PROVIDING A REAL SOLUTION TO THE T. LEVEL RIGHT CRISIS WE APPRECIATE SENATOR ALLEN'S LEADERSHIP AND URGE YOUR ITEM. ON THE BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU. WE DON'T HAVE ANY OF. REGISTER AN OPPOSITE. BUT WILL NOW TAKE. I'M TED. FROM WITH.

OUR COASTAL WETLANDS STREAMS FOR IS ENDANGERED SPECIES HABITAT AGRICULTURAL LAND SCENIC VIEW SHEDS LOW COST RECREATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES. AND SO- YOU KNOW FOLKS MAY RECALL THAT THE BECAUSE THE COMMISSION HISTORICALLY WAS LIMITED IN ITS ABILITY TO ENFORCE I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT YOU ARE I HAVE ITEM THREE IS SB THREE FOUR SORRY I WAS DOING FOR THIRTY THREE OKAY YEAH I WOULD HAVE PREFERRED TO MAKE SURE EVERYONE KNOWS THAT THERE'S THROUGH ALL THIS YES. OKAY ONCE AGAIN ANOTHER BILL WOULD OFTEN THIS ALSO HAD STRONG BIPARTISAN SUPPORT THE SENATE THREE FORTY THREE THE TRUTH IN LABELING FOR RECYCLING MATERIAL RECYCLABLE MATERIAL SO LET ME START BY ACCEPTING THE- THE COMMITTEE'S ANALYSIS- AMENDMENTS AND I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR ITS STRONG AND DILIGENT WORK ON THE BILL. ON THE CHANGES THAT WERE LISTED I REFLECT ONGOING CONVERSATIONS WITH THE OPPOSITION. AND THEY HELP US TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT INDUSTRY HAS RAISED SO THIS IS A IS A SIMPLE MEASURE I KNOW I KNOW WE'RE ALL SUPPOSED TO WARY WHEN PEOPLE SAY THAT BUT BUT IT IS IT IS SO THE IDEA IS THAT WHEN THE CURRENT LAW PROHIBITS THE MANUFACTURE FOR MAKING UNTRUTHFUL ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS- SUCH AS RECYCLABLE IF AN ITEM IS NOT REALLY RECYCLABLE IN THE REAL WORLD. I'M SO YOU CANNOT WRITE THE WORD RECYCLABLE ON YOUR BOTTLE IF YA IF THE BOTTLES NOT REALLY RECYCLABLE AND YET- YOUR FOLKS YOU RIGHT WE'RE NOT ABLE TO PUT THE WORD RECYCLABLE ROUTINELY PUT THE RECYCLING SYMBOL ON THEIR ITEMS ARE BECAUSE THERE'S NO PROHIBITION. AGAINST THAT SO THIS BILL EXTENDS THIS PROHIBITION TO THE FOR THE USE OF THE CHASING ARROW. SYMBOL THAT RECYCLING SYMBOL THAT WE ALL KNOW. IF THE MATERIALS RECYCLE AND IT IT OFFERS CLEAR GUIDED ON WHAT IS. CONSTITUTES HERE'S THE SAD TRUTH MEMBERS. ARE LESS THAN 15% OF SINGLE USE PLASTIC IS ACTUALLY RECYCLED. IN OUR STATE AND WE ACTUALLY HAVE RELATIVELY HIGH NUMBERS COMPARED TO OTHER PLACES- NOW RECYCLING COSTS ARE NOW EXCUSE EXCEEDING THE SCRAP VALUE OF THE PLASTIC MITCHELL ITSELF AND THIS IS ONE OF THE REALLY IMPORTANT THINGS. THERE IS SO MUCH. ARE YOU FOLKS JUST DUTIFULLY PUT ALL THESE ITEMS IN THE BLUE BINS HOPING THAT THESE ITEMS WILL BE RECYCLED. IT'S CALLED WISH CYCLING. AND SOMETIMES- YOU KNOW THE OTHER DUTIES THERE'S FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS ON THE ON THEIR ON THEIR OF. PLASTIC MATERIALS THEY SEE THE RECYCLING SYMBOL I USED TO DO THIS ALL THE TIME I CAN TELL I LEARNED A LOT ABOUT THIS. MY NEWSPAPER I STILL READ THE YOU KNOW THE L. A. TIMES IN AT MY HOME AND THEY COME IN THIS LITTLE SLEEVE. AND THERE WAS A RECYCLING SYMBOL ON THERE. AND I WOULD ALWAYS DUTIFULLY SEPARATED OUT AND PUT IT RIGHT IN MY RECYCLING BIN BECAUSE IT HAD THE RECYCLING SYMBOL THERE. I WILL TURNS OUT THAT'S IT THAT'S A TYPE OF HIGHLY UNRESECTABLE PLASTIC IT IS TECHNICALLY RECYCLABLE UNDER THE BEST OF CONDITIONS AT A THOUSAND DEGREES AND SOME LAB IN. IN SAN MARINO BUT- BUT YOU KNOW THE OTHER DAY IT'S NOT IT'S NOT IT'S NOT RECYCLE THEIR NOT RECYCLED IN THE REAL WORLD AND IN FACT THOSE NEWSPAPER SLEEVES AND- SO MANY EXAMPLES OF THIS. ACTUALLY AN UPCOMING UP THE PROCESS. THE END UP- JAMMING UP THE MACHINES THEY END UP GETTING STUCK INTO THE PAPER. THEY ACTUALLY END UP MAKING THE WHOLERECYCLING SYSTEM MORE. EXPENSIVE AND LESS EFFICIENT. AND SO. THAT YOU KNOW. SO FIRST OF ALL IF A IF THE MATERIAL IS NOT ACTUALLY RECYCLABLE THEY HAVE TO GO THROUGH A WHOLE PROCESS. OUT THE RECYCLING. AT THE SORTING CENTERS. IF YOU HAVE A BIT OF ONE OF THE SENATE BEFORE. LET'S GO I IT'S A IT'S A I OPENING EXPERIENCE. AT THE ITEM ACTION HAS TO BE. PHYSICALLY REMOVED FROM THE CONVEYOR BELT OUT THE RECYCLING FACILITY AND THEN OF COURSE CARTED AWAY. TO A LANDFILL. I THE EXTRA THIS IS EXTRA WORK IT INCREASED THE RECRUITERS WASTE RATES IT. IT THE COST OF THE PROCESS TRULY MICHAEL MATERIAL. IT'S ALSO COURSE CONTAMINATED. THE- THE EXISTING RECYCLE MUCH OF ONE REASONS WHY CHINA. DECIDED TO END- THE IMPORTATION OF A RECYCLING MATERIAL ESPECIALLY IN THE AREA PAPER FOR EXAMPLE IS IT SO MUCH PLASTIC. WAS GETTING STUCK IN THE PAPER VEILS- THAT. THAT THE PAPER THE VALUE OF THOSE PAPER BALLOTS WAS JUST RENDERED- IS SUCH THAT IT JUST WASN'T. WORTH THEIR THEIR RECEIVING THEM ANYMORE. AND HERE'S THE THING IT'S ABOUT IT IS ALREADY HITTING YOUR- CONSTITUENTS. POCKETBOOKS A SURVEY RELEASED THIS YEAR BY THE CALIFORNIA CITIES FOUND THAT MORE THAN SEVEN OF TEN CITIES ANTICIPATE INCREASING WASTE COLLECTION RATES BY AS MUCH AS 20% MEMBERS. TO COVER THE COST OF MANAGING THE ADDITIONAL WASTE SIX COUNTY SACRAMENTO JUST RAISE THEIR RATES FOR TRASH COLLECTION I BELIEVE BY LITTLE OVER TEN DOLLARS NOW ON TOP OF AN ALREADY. AND IS SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT TEN DOLLARS A MONTH SO THE STRAIN ON LOCAL RECYCLING CONSUMERS MISTAKENLY BELIEVE THAT THE CHASING EURO SYMBOL IT OFTEN IN CIRCLES THE PLASTIC RESIN IDENTIFICATION CODE. MEANS THAT THE PRODUCT IS RECYCLABLE. HI SO. YOU KNOW. WE KNOW THAT THAT RECYCLING IS CONFUSING I'M THERE'S OF THERE WAS A STUDY THAT WAS TAKEN BY THE CONSUMER BRANDS ASSOCIATION THAT THAT FINDS IT MORE. THEY GIVE IT MERICAN FIND RECYCLING KNOWING HOW TO RECYCLE WHAT TO RECYCLE MORE CONFUSING THAN BUILDING IEA FURNITURE. DOING THEIR TAXES PLAYING THE STOCK MARKET OR UNDERSTANDING THEIR SPOUSE. SO THERE WE ARE WE WANT TO WE WANT TO CONFORM. THE RULES. SO THAT IF YOU CAN'T SAY THAT THE ITEMS RECYCLE IF YOU CAN'T PRINT THAT IF YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED UNDER OUR- UNDER OUR RULES TO PRINT PRINT TO PRINT THAT YOUR ITEM IS RECYCLABLE BECAUSE IS NOT TRULY RECYCLE IN THE REAL WORLD YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO SLAP. THE CHASING EURO SYMBOL THERE. ON TO THAT ITEM. SO I WITH ME TODAY WE HAVE HEIDI SANBORN FROM THE NATIONAL STEWARDSHIP ACTION COUNCIL. WHO ALSO CHAIRS THE STATEWIDE RECYCLING COMMISSION AND ALSO MARKET PRAYER. WHO'S HERE FROM REPUBLIC SERVICES YOU CAN GIVE. THAT THE GUY ON THE GROUND EXPERIENCE OF A WASTE HAULER WHO DEALS. WITH ALL OF THIS. MESS SO LET'S START WITH. WHAT PEOPLE. WOULD KNOW THANK IT WILL GO HEAD START WITH MARK SINCE HE'S HERE IN THE IN THE ROOM. ALL RIGHT- MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE US SENATOR ALAN- WE WANT TO THANK CENTER ALLEN FOR BRINGING THIS MEASURE FORWARD. AND APPRECIATE HIS EFFORTS TO MAKE RECYCLING MORE EFFECTIVE. REPUBLIC SERVICES- SUPPORTS SB THREE FORTY THREE A MEASURE THAT IS AS MUCH ABOUT TRUTH IN ADVERTISING. AS IT IS ABOUT IMPROVING CALIFORNIA'S RECYCLING SYSTEM. CALIFORNIA'S RECYCLING INFRASTRUCTURE IS ONE OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT IN THE WORLD BUT IN SPITE OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS BEING INVESTED. INTO THE SYSTEM AND INFRASTRUCTURE TO IMPROVE RECYCLING CONTAMINATION REMAINS ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT AND EXPENSIVE OBSTACLES. SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE AN EXTENSIVE MANUAL SORT LINES OPTICAL SORTER SCREEN SHREDDER'S BLOWERS AND OTHER ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES AND LOCAL JURISDICTIONS AND THEIR LOCAL HAULERS SPEND HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ANNUALLY EDUCATING CONSUMERS. ON WHAT IS RECYCLABLE IN AN EFFORT TO IMPROVE RECYCLING RATES AND REDUCE CONTAMINATION RECYCLING COSTS. WITH THOSE DOLLARS ARE WASTED IF PACKAGING- MATERIAL INCLUDING MARKINGS THAT FALSELY CLAIM THOSE PACKAGES OR MATERIALS ARE RECYCLABLE. FALSE CLAIMS OF RECYCLABILITY CONFUSE CONSUMERS WHO ALREADY STRUGGLE IDENTIFYING CORRECTLY WHAT SHOULD BE PLACED IN THE RECYCLING BIN I'M SURE ALL OF YOU HAVE YOUR OWN EXPERIENCE- AS WELL AS EXPERIENCE WITHIN YOUR FAMILIES. SENATE BILL FIVE THREE FORTY THREE IS FINAL MENTALLY ABOUT TRUTH IN ADVERTISING DON'T CLAIM YOUR PACKAGE OR MATERIAL IS RECYCLABLE ON THERE UNLESS THERE IS AN ACTUAL RECYCLABLE RECYCLING MARKET FOR THE MATERIAL. AND IT CAN BE READILY AND EFFECTIVELY REMOVED FROM THE WASTE STREAM. CENTER ALLEN TOOK MY EXAMPLE IN TERMS OF PLASTIC FILM- THOSE ARE REPEATED WITH OTHER KINDS OF CONTAINERS AND SOLID WASTE THAT CLAIM TO BE RECYCLING BUT IN FACT OR NOT. SB THREE FORTY THREE CENTS AN EFFECTIVE IN CLEAR STANDARD FOR RECYCLABILITY THE WILL INCREASE RECYCLING EFFICIENCIES IMPROVE CONSUMER CONFIDENCE IN RECYCLING AND WILL REDUCE RECYCLING RATES FOR RATE PAYERS LOCAL JURISDICTIONS AND RECYCLING. WE THANK YOU CENTER ALLEN AND WE URGE I DON'T. THANK YOU. NEXT WE HAVE HEIDI SANBORN ON THE LINE MODERATOR CAN YOU PLEASE OPEN THE LINE FOR HIGH MISS SAMPARK. THANK YOU KAREN MEMBERS MY NAME IS HEIDI SANBORN AND I AM THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE NATIONAL STEWARDSHIP ACTION COUNCIL A NONPROFIT THAT ADVOCATES FOR CIRCULAR ECONOMY AND A CO SPONSOR OF A THREE THREE FOUR THREE. I ALSO HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF SERVING AS CHAIR OF THE STATEWIDE COMMISSION ON RECYCLING MARKETS AND CURBSIDE RECYCLING A GROUP OF SEVENTEEN DIVERSE STAKEHOLDERS TO REPRESENT LOCAL GOVERNMENT WASTE HAULERS AN NGO. BUT IF CLASS WAS PROVIDING ADVICE THE STATE ON HOW TO REDUCE CONTAMINATION IN OUR RECYCLING SYSTEM. THE COMMISSION RELEASED THE PRELIMINARY REPORT LAST DECEMBER WITH NINETEEN UNANIMOUSLY ADOPTED POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS ONE OF WHICH RECOMMENDS TRUTHFUL LABELING TO REDUCE CONSUMER CONFUSION AND THE RESULTING CONTAMINATION. THE CHICKEN THERE- SYMBOL IS UNIVERSALLY UNDERSTOOD TO SYMBOLIZE RECYCLABILITY THE COMPANIES ARE CURRENTLY PUTTING THE SYMBOL ON TOPICS THAT CANNOT BE RECYCLED. THIS CREATES CONFUSION AND LYFT WHICH CYCLING RESULTING IN CONTAMINATION IN THE SYSTEM AND INCREASED. COSTS THAT ARE BORNE BY RATEPAYERS. ACCORDING TO CONSUMER SO. PRESENTED REUSE. AND CONFUSED REPORT ON THE FOR FIRST I U. S. RESPONSE SAID THAT RECYCLING IS NOT CONFUSING. CONSUMERS WANT TO DO THE RIGHT THING BUT THEY FEEL LIKE THEY WHEN THEY LEARNED THAT SOME PRODUCTS THE PACKAGING VERIFICATION ELIGIBLE AND ARE NOT RECYCLABLE AND THEY GET MAD AT GOVERNMENT FOR ALLOWING THE COMPANIES USE THE FOOTPATH DECEPTIVE LABELING. I THINK THREE FOUR THREE WILL STOP MISLABELING AND ALLOW CONSUMERS TO MAKE INFORMED PURCHASING DECISIONS BASED ON THE RESPECTABILITY OF THE ITEMS THEY PURCHASE. LASTLY WE ALL AGREE THAT NATIONAL HARMONIZE RULES ON LABELING WOULD BE BEST. HOWEVER CALIFORNIA SHOULD NOT BE HELD BACK BY OTHER STATES THAT ALLOW PEOPLE USING AND MISLEADING LABELING. CALIFORNIA'S DEMAND AND DESERVE THE TRUTH AND CALIFORNIA MUDSLIDE AND WE HOPE TO SET THE STANDARD FOR THE NATION. THAT'S NATIONAL ORGANIZATION A NATIONAL SEARCH ACTION COUNCIL COMMITTED TO HELPING INDUSTRY CREATE HARMONIZATION. BUT WE ALL THE FIRE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. I'M NEXT WE HAVE TO WITNESSES REGISTERED TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION. WE HAVE LAUREN AGUILAR FROM AMERICAN AND THE FLEXIBLE PACKAGING ASSOCIATION AND SHANNON CRAWFORD FROM THE PLASTICS INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION. MODERATOR Q. PLEASE OPEN UP THE LINES FOR THEM. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS SHANNON CRAWFORD AND I'M WITH THE PLASTICS INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION. WE REPRESENT LIKE THE ENTIRE SUPPLY CHAIN FROM PLASTIC MANUFACTURING IN THE UNITED STATES WHICH COVERS OVER SIXTY ONE THOUSAND COPIES IN CALIFORNIA. ABILITIES PRIMARY FOCUS OF OUR MEMBERS ARE FIFTEEN. MEMBERS ARE INTENT ON USING RECYCLED CONTENT IN CREATING AND MARKET A LOT LESS MATERIAL GOING TO LANDFILL. I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO EXPRESS OUR CONCERNS IT'S ESTATE THREE FORTY THREE BECAUSE ALTHOUGH UNINTENDED IT WILL RESULT IN LESS RECYCLING AND. MATERIAL FILLING THE LAND. PLEASE HAS STARTED AND CONVERSATION ON THE RIGHT NOT GONNA. CARD OR THE REST. THE CURRENT STANDARD DICTATE NICO SHOULD BE IN HIGH TRYING. DESPITE IN. ON BONNELL BRIDGES THINK YOU HOURS. I'M FOR. THIRTY EIGHT SO WHAT PART OF THE CODE BE PLACED INSIDE THREE CHASING. CREATING SIGNIFICANT SIGNIFICANT CONSUMER CONFUSION. I THINK COMMITTED TO SUPPORTING EFFORTS AT LEAST THIRTY. TO FOLLOW CALIFORNIA'S LEAD. AN UPDATE CURRENT. WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE AUTHORED WHICH ALLOW MEMBERS. HI FI UPDATE THEM ALL. UNDER SOME PARTICULAR AMENDMENT THEY ARE VERY CONCERNED REGARDING THE- LANGUAGE OF THIS% LEGISLATURE. WELL THE THIRD SUPPORT TO REDUCE CONTAMINATION WE CANNOT SUPPORT THREE THREE BECAUSE THE CRITERIA OUTLINED% TO DETERMINE RECYCLABILITY IS SEVERELY RESTRICTED. USING THAT CRITERIA ONLY PEACHY IN HDPE BOTTLES WOULD BE ACCEPTED AFTER CYCLE ACROSS EIGHT. PTP ONE PACKAGE SO MUCH OF CALIFORNIA'S FRESH PRODUCE WOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED RECYCLABLE AND NEITHER WOULD PROBABLY PROBABLY MUCHAS MATERIAL QUALITIES WHICH MAKE IT CONFIRM RENDON PROVIDING. IF YOU THINK YOU ARE. YEAH OMMITTEE WE PASSED AB FOURTH EIGHT. REQUIRED MUCH MICHAEL. CONTACT FORM HOWEVER THE BEFORE YOU GET IN THOSE NUMBER THANK AND IT WOULD ALL BE. MAKING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF AB FOUR. ALL WE DON'T. CAN ONLY BE ACHIEVED FINANCES UNDER AND- REPORTS OUR IF I JUST BUT MAY IT NEXT MONTH. TO DEVELOP MARKET MATURE NOT RESPECTFUL DAY ONE.

THANK YOU KAREN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS BORN ACTOR AND I'M HERE TODAY REPRESENTING AMERICAN WHICH IS THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE FOR PACKAGING AND THE ENVIRONMENT AND FTA THE FLEXIBLE PACKAGING ASIAN BOTH APPROPRIATIONS REPRESENT PACKAGING MATERIAL SUPPLIERS PACKAGING PRODUCERS AND CONSUMERS THAT COMPANIES I AM TESTIFYING TODAY IS CONCERNED BUT AT THE THREE FORTY THREE. MANY OF OUR MEMBERS ARE WORKING TO INCREASE THE RECYCLING IN THE REUSE OF THEIR PACKAGING WHAT YOU KNOW WITH THE GOAL OF THE AUTHOR GOLDIS COMMITTEE ANIMAL CALIFORNIA WE ALSO WANT MORE PACKAGES TO BE RECYCLED BUT AT THE END OF THE FIFTEEN EIGHTY THREE COMMISSION LIST OF RECYCLABLE ONLY FIFTEEN MATERIALS MAY SELECT WHICH CONSISTS OF EIGHT PAPER MATERIAL TO TOUCH THE GLASS YOU TYPE OF METAL DETECTOR PLASTICS AND ONE TYPE OF CULT CLASSIC. BASED ON THE CURRENT LANGUAGE OF SB THREE FORTY THREE WEEKS BACK OUR FACULTY REGENT SIMILAR AN EXTREMELY LIMITING WHAT IT'LL HAVE RESOUNDING IMPACT ON THE ABILITY OF THE STATE TO REACH THEIR 75% DIVERSION GOALS AND HINDER THE STATE'S ABILITY TO ADOPT AND IMPLEMENT A COMPREHENSIVE. CIRCULAR ECONOMY SOLUTIONS PACKAGING. CURRENTLY STATES WERE. THAT AGAIN. CODE FIRST PLASTIC. THE LOCATE INSIDE SHE EUROPE AND ALL. AT THREE THREE FORTY WOULD MAKE UNLAWFUL FOR MATURE NOT ON THE RECYCLE IT HAPPENS. WHICH WOULD FORCE TO THE OUTCOME WITH STATE IN IN THE END MANDATING CALIFORNIA ONLY PACKAGING PRODUCTS. SO WE HAVE BEEN WORKING- WE HAVE BEEN HAVING CONVERSATIONS WITH DOCTOR DOCTOR TO SEND THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE BILL IN ORDER FOR INDUSTRY TO WORK ON GETTING OTHER STATES LATE LAWS CHANGE. BY MEMBERS WON'T HAVE CONFLICTING PACKAGING REQUIREMENTS WOULD YOU WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR IN THE COMMITTEE FOR THOSE AMENDMENTS ARE LAID OUT OUT THIS IS A POSITIVE CHANGES AND WE KNOW THERE ARE MORE CHANGES TO COME TO GET. TO CREATE A SOLUTION THAT WILL POP CONTAMINATION IN THE CURBSIDE CAN HELP MARKET YOUR- CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TALK ABOUT AND I LOOK FORWARD. TO THE CONTINUED CONVERSATION DROP OFF. THANK YOU. NEXT WE'LL MOVE TO TESTIMONY FROM WITNESSES. IN SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION- WILL BE TAKING NAME AFFILIATION AND POSITION ON THE BILL.

THANK YOU- NEXT WILL TAKE QUESTIONS FOR THE AUTHOR FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA. I THINK ACTUALLY JUST A COMMENT AND IF THE BILL HASN'T BEEN WILLING TO MOVE THE BILL I DO APPRECIATE IT WORK I HAVE A LOT OF INTEREST IN THE DEFINITION OF RECYCLING THESE LABELS ARE MISLEADING. AND I WANT TO INCREASE OPPOSITION TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH YOU I KNOW YOU HAVE AN OPEN OFFICE AND I APPRECIATE THE IMMENSELY DAN I DO BELIEVE. OF REAL CONCERNS CAN BE ADDRESSED AND I JUST WANT TO SAY THERE WAS A COMMENT ABOUT THIS BILL LEADING TO MORE STEPPING LANDFILL THE REALITIES AT ALL MOST OF THE STUFF IS ALREADY BEING LANDFILLS OR BEING BURNED ARE BEING SHIPPED OUT OR PRETENDING RECYCLING. OUT THERE AND SO THAT'S A FALSE NARRATIVE THAT WE NEED TO GET BEYOND IT WOULD REALLY WANT TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM AND SO I DO APPRECIATE THE WORK I'M HOPEFUL THAT WE CAN GET THERE. AND I'LL BE TRACKING THIS ALONG THE WAY BUT AT THINKING JUST AGAIN WANT TO STRONGLY ENCOURAGE FOLKS TO HAVE A REAL DISCUSSION OF ABOUT THE SITUATION THAT WE HAVE OUT THERE 90% OF STUFF IS NOT BE RECYCLED CAN'T BE RECYCLED AND- A CAT. IF WE HAVE WE WILL HAVE TO KNOWLEDGE SHE IT WOULD HAVE A MARKET OR DIFFICULTY DOES NOT FIT WITHIN OUR ENVIRONMENTAL CLEAN ENERGY OR LIKE CLIMATE CHANGE GOALS IT'S NOT TECHNOLOGY THAT WE COULD USE AND WE NEED TO BE TAKING ALL THAT INTO ACCOUNT AS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WHAT'S RECYCLABLE AND HAVING A REAL CONVERSATION WITH. THE. COMMUNITY MEMBERS OUT THERE. THANK YOU. YES YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER WHAT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD- I I'VE FASCINATED BY THE OPPOSITION ARGUMENT HERE A SOME OF THEM AND- I KNOW YOU'RE WRKING WITH THEM IN A CRISPY SHEET THAT- YEAH I WAS I AM ALWAYS DILIGENT ABOUT TRYING TO FIGURE OUT OKAY. HOW HOW WHERE THINGS ARE SUPPOSED TO GO IN AND TRY TO DO THE RIGHT THING AND THE REALIZATION THAT THAT A LOT OF THESE PLASTICS ARE SIMPLY NOT RECYCLABLE. IS REALLY REALLY FRUSTRATING FOR PEOPLE TRYING TO DO THE RIGHT THING. I GUESS WHAT I FOUND INTERESTING ABOUT THE OPPOSITION ARGUMENT WAS THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO LABEL SOMETHING DIFFERENT FOR CALIFORNIA. THEN OTHER STATES AND I WOULD JUST SAY WHY DON'T YOU JUST DO THE RIGHT THING AND LABEL IT LIKE WE DO IN CALIFORNIA AND STOP BEING DISINGENUOUS WITH OTHER STATES. GO TO ONE SYSTEM WE'RE GONNA WITH THIS IS GOING TO BE WELL VETTED WE KNOW WHAT CAN BE RECYCLED NOT WHEN WE JUST DO ONE SYSTEM. AND HAVE EVERYBODY ADOPTED THEN YOU WON'T HAVE TO FIGHT LEGISLATION IN EVERY STATE. JUST BITE THE BULLET AND DO IT RIGHT THANKS AND I WOULD LOVE TO BE A CO AUTHOR THROUGH THIS BILL NOTHING. YES MURATSUCHI. THANK YOU I WANT TO ECHO ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOODS COMMENTS- ANOTHER EXAMPLE FOR CALIFORNIA SHOULD LEAD THE REST OF THE COUNTRY IN TERMS OF. TRUTH AND RECYCLING- YOU KNOW THIS IDEA OF WISHFUL RECYCLING IS A CONSTANT- THE SUBJECT OF DEBATE BETWEEN MYSELF AND MY WIFE. YOU KNOW SHE'S A HOME WHERE WE'RE ALWAYS TALKING ABOUT THE YOU KNOW HER FAVORITE WORD IS RECYCLE RECYCLE ANALYSTS JUST A- YOU KNOW A- PUT THIS IN THE RECYCLING BIN WHERE YOU KNOW I. AM AFRAID I AM ALWAYS JOKING THAT SHE'S GOING TO PUT ME IN THE RECYCLING BIN SUNDAY. BUT YEAH. YOU'RE MORE COMPOST. IT'S WHAT AND- ACTUALLY GREAT BILL AGAIN I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO BE ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BRINGING THIS FAR ASSEMBLY MEMBER SAY OUR TALK. SORRY IT ON THE I THINK RECYCLING IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE BIGGER CHALLENGES WE HAVE NATION. AND PART OF IT IS BECAUSE OUR APPROACH USED TO BE. THE STAFF WE DON'T WANT TO RECYCLE OR DON'T WANT TO DEVELOP THE TECHNOLOGY RECYCLE. WE JUST SHIPPED OTHER NATIONS AND HOPE THAT THEY WOULD DO SOMETHING WITH IT- AND THEY DID THEY PUT IT IN THE OCEAN SOON THEN FLOATED BACK ON THE OTHER. THAT'S RIGHT- SO WE'VE KIND OF LEARNED FROM THAT BUT- IN ORDER. FOR ME LOOKING THAT ENTIRE RECYCLING THING AND I'M GLAD TO SEE THE WASTE INDUSTRY IS FINALLY REPRESENTED. IN IN THIS CONVERSATION BECAUSE IN THE PAST WE'VE DONE SOME LEGISLATION. THAT THEY WERE ABSOLUTELY EXCLUDED FROM AND NOW WE HAVE LEGISLATION THAT WE'RE HAVING A HARD TIME- IN ACTING BECAUSE THEY ARE AN INTEGRAL PART OF IT AND WE JUST DON'T HAVE. THE CAPACITY. OR THE- TECHNOLOGY TO DOA CONFLICT WHAT WE WANTED TO ACCOMPLISH. BUT ONE OF MY QUESTIONS IS. SO YOU KNOW THE OTHER STATES THAT HAVE THIS PACKAGING YOU KNOW THAT THE LABELING REQUIREMENTS AND THINGS. IS THE ISSUE THAT IT'S SIMPLY NOT. ARE RECYCLABLE OR REUSABLE OR IS IT THAT. THE TECHNOLOGY THAT'S REQUIRED IS NOT NECESSARILY- YEAH IS COST EFFECTIVE AND THEREFORE WE DON'T USE IT- BECAUSE OTHER STATES MAY FIND IT IS COST EFFECTIVE FOR THEM AND THEY ARE USING IT AND THEY DO HAVE A WAY OF TAKING SOME OF THE THINGS WE CONSIDER NOT TO BE RECYCLABLE. AND RECYCLING AND RE USING THOSE MATERIALS AND BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL OF ARE ALSO IN CALIFORNIA IF WE'RE GOING TO SEPARATE OURSELVES FROM EVERYONE ELSE- THERE'S A COST TO DOING THAT AND THAT COST IS ADDED ON TO THE COST OF. LIVING HERE IN CALIFORNIA WHICH IS ALREADY HIGHER THAN A LOT OF DIFFERENT PLACES. AND THAT COST IS BORN- ESPECIALLY BY. YEAH YEAH YOU COMMUNITIES THAT ARE ARE- PREDOMINANTLY POOR. AND THEREFORE DON'T REALLY HAVE THE RESOURCES TO KEEP SPENDING MORE AND MORE MORE ON ON ON ON THEIR ON THEIR FOOD. SUPPLIES SO YOU KNOW THOSE ARE A COUPLE THINGS THAT CONCERN ME IS IT MAYBE YOU CAN ADDRESS THE FIRST ONE ABOUT- WHAT OTHER STATES ARE DOING. THAT WE MAY NOT BE DOING- SO WE CAN'T WE CONSIDER SOMETHING RECYCLABLE NOT RECYCLABLE WHILE THEY DO. YEAH SO. AND THEN I'D LOVE IT IF YOU COULD COULD. YOU HAVE REPEAT THAT THAT. THAT EQUITY QUESTION YES AT THE END BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW THAT I. FULLER ABOUT THE FIRST QUESTION. I'M SO. THAT WE YOUR CALIFORNIA ACTUALLY DOES HAVE ONE OF THE BEST SYSTEMS- IT'S A COMBINATION OF SEVERAL FACTORS IN. LARGELY THE SECOND WHEN YOU TALKED ABOUT IN TERMS OF. COST EFFECTIVENESS- AND THEN OF COURSE AND MARKETS RIGHT SO THAT THEY GO HAND IN HAND IF YOU CAN'T FIND IN A MARKET TO SELL THE PRODUCTS AND- YOU COULD SPEND VERY LITTLE ON RECYCLING AND IT STILL ISN'T GOING TO PENCIL OUT. RIGHT SO YOU'VE GOT IT YOU GOT IT YOU GOT TO STRIKE A BALANCE HERE. AND IN THE END OF THE DAY- THE MOST OF THE ITEMS THAT HAVE THE RECYCLING SYMBOL WITH THE THREE THREE SEVEN. NUMBER IN THE MIDDLE. MOST OF THEM ARE TECHNICALLY RECYCLABLE UNDER UNDER PERFECT CONDITIONS- BUT FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS IT'S JUST THEY ARE NOT BEING RECYCLED- IT IT IT'S ULTIMATELY IT'S AS YOU SAY IT'S A COMBINATION OF. OF COST EFFECTIVENESS TECHNOLOGY AND MARKETS. I'M YEAH THE SORTING SYSTEM. OBVIOUSLY IF WE HAD SOMETHING MORE COMPREHENSIVE I MEAN YOU KNOW FOLKS MAY KNOW THAT I'VE BEEN WORKING WITH A NUMBER OF YOU ONE ON UP ON A BROADER PLAY IN THIS AREA WITH SB FIFTY FOUR. FIVE AND THE IDEAS WITH THAT BILL THAT WE WOULD HAVE JUST. MORE SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTS IN THE SYSTEM WRIT LARGE AND THAT WOULD ACTUALLY HELP TO. TO CHANGE OUR SYSTEM SAYS THAT THERE. IS SUCH THAT WE WOULDN'T HAVE. QUITE THE SAME SORTING. AND RESTRUCTURING I CHALLENGES THAT THEY CURRENTLY MAKE SO MUCH OF RECYCLING COPS COST PROHIBITIVE- BUT WE DO HAVE ONE OF THE BEST SYSTEMS IN THE COUNTRY- YOU KNOW. THE I HAVEN'T. BEEN PRESENTED WITH A CASE WHERE THERE'S ANOTHER STATE THAT HAPPENS TO HAVE A VERY EFFECTIVE RECYCLING SYSTEM FOR A PARTICULAR RESIN TYPE. THAT WE DON'T HAVE. THAT THIS WOULD JAM UP. I'M I'M CERTAINLY HAPPY TO IF THERE IS A CASE OF LIKE THAT MAYBE WE CAN FIGURE OUT A WAY TO ENSURE THAT. BECAUSE I THINK I WANT TO DO IS JAM UP A GOOD. RECYCLING SYSTEM THAT MIGHT EXIST IN ANOTHER STATE MAYBE THERE'S A WAY WE COULD. YOU TWEAK THAT TWEET THE BILL TO ACCOMMODATE THAT WE DO HAVE LANGUAGE IN THE BILL IN ITS ITS ALLUDED TO ON PAGE TWO OF THE ANALYSIS WHICH- INVOLVES THESE THE- YOU KNOW IF A PRODUCER. CAN COME FORWARD. WITH THAT WITH SOME SORT OF PLAN- IF THEY IF THEY FEEL AS THOUGH- YOU KNOW THAT THERE THERE IS AN EMERGING MARKET FOR EXAMPLE IN ONE OF THESE OTHER RESIN TYPES. THAT HASN'T BEEN COVERED- BY THE BILL THEY CAN COME FOR WITH THE PLAN TO WORK WITH CAL RECYCLE TO GET. TO GET IT INCLUDED- SO THERE IS FLEXIBILITY THAT WE OFFER BUT WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT- THAT THE YEAR THE- THE ITEMS ARE REALLY BEING RECYCLED I MEAN BECAUSE ONLY- GARCIA'S ABSOLUTE RIGHT THIS IDEA THAT SOMEHOW THIS IS GOING TO LEAD TO MORE LANDFILLING. THE FACT IS ALL THIS ALL THIS THAT IS GOING TO LANDFILL ANYWAY AND IF ANYTHING ALL IT'S DOING IS MAKING IT LESS LIKELY. FOR THE ONES AND TWOS THAT REALLY ARE RECYCLABLE. THEY'RE ACTUALLY GETTING PROPERLY SORTED AND RECYCLED. AND THAT'S THAT'S THE SAD REALITY AND DONE ONE OF THE THINGS ABOUT RECYCLING YOU KNOW WHEN YOU GO TO A RECYCLING CENTER WHEN YOU GO TO ADOPT. YOU REALIZED THAT THE YOU KNOW YOU CAN SPEND SO MUCH TIME. JUST YOU'RE PERFECTLY CLEANING UP THEY'RE PEOPLE WHO WASH ALL THEIR AYE. BEFORE THEY PUT IN THE RECYCLING. TO THE CHANCE RECYCLE. IN AND THAT'S A GOOD THING TO DO BUT- YOU KNOW WHEN YOU GO TO THIS WHEN YOU WHEN YOU GO AND SEE THE SYSTEM WRIT LARGE YOU SEE HOW IT'S ALL. O THE CONVEYOR BELT TOGETHER. AND THERE'S JUST. THESE THESE MACHINES AND MAGNETS AND PEOPLE SORTING AND IT'S A IT'S A BALK SYSTEM- AND- YOU KNOW. IT'S IT IS TRUE THERE WILL PROBABLY BE A COUPLE LITTLE ITEMS THAT WILL NOT GET RECYCLED THAT WE'RE GONNA GET RECYCLED UNDER- IF AS A RESULT THIS BILL PASSING BUT THE FACT OF MATTER IS THE SYSTEM IS SO MASSIVE ITSELF MACRO. ON ALL THOSE ITEMS THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF THOSE THREE THREE SEVENS ARE NOT GETTING RECYCLED AND THEY'RE ACTUALLY MAKING IT HARDER TO RECYCLE THE ONES AND TWOS IF WE HAVE IF WE ARE IF OUR GOAL IS. ZERO WASTE AND RECYCLING EVERYTHING THEN THE TECHNOLOGIES FOR THOSE HAVE TO BE EMPLOYED IN OPEN WHEN THERE'S NO MARKET FOR THE TECHNOLOGY. THAT'S WHEN GOVERNMENT HAS TO STEP IN IF THAT'S THE IF IT'S IF IT'S THAT IMPORTANT FOR THE- PUBLIC. TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT I DO I WE NEED TO STOP SKIRTING AROUND THAT PART. WELL IN THAT POLICY HAS TO BE DEALT WITH SOME I APPRECIATE YOU ANSWERING THE QUESTION YOU DID ANSWER THAT ONE QUESTION WHICH IS YES THERE'S A LOT OF RECYCLE STUFF THAT WE JUST. CHOOSE NOT TO. ADD BASIC WHAT I WILL SAY ASSEMBLY MEMBER IS. TO THE EXTENT WE CAN. RIGHT IF WE DO WANNA RECYCLE EVERYTHING. THE PRODUCERS SHOULD BE SHIFTING TO THE HIGHLY RECYCLABLE RESIN TYPES RIGHT. SO THERE ARE LOTS AND LOTS OF PRODUCTS THAT COULD JUST AS EASILY BE MADE WITH A THREE AS WITH THE ONE. AND THERE ARE EXAMPLES OF PRODUCERS WHO HAVE SHIFTED FROM A ONE TWO OR THREE. SIMPLY FOR AESTHETIC REASONS. AND THAT DECISION. RENDERS THAT ITEM NON RECYCLABLE JUST LIKE THAT. WE SHOULD BE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN. TO INTO TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE TO ENCOURAGE PRODUCERS. WHO ARE IN THE PLASTIC SPACE TO BE. PRODUCING THEIR PRODUCTS USING THE ONES AND TWOS. WHICH ARE HIGHLY RECYCLABLE AND- OBVIOUSLY THAT'S A BIG PART OF THE GOAL OF FIFTY FOUR TO BE HONEST SB FIFTY FOUR BUT- BUT TO THE YOU TO THE EXTENT THAT THIS IS. IMPOSING SOME TRUTH IN LABELING. IF PRODUCERS DO CARE ABOUT REAL RECYCLABILITY IN AND SHOWING THAT FACE TO THE PUBLIC. I TO THE EXTENT THEY CAN DAY WELL UNDER THIS BILL START. USING MORE THE ONES AND TWOS RATHER THAN THE NON RECYCLABLE PLASTICS IS THERE A PRODUCT COST TO THEM. IT TOTALLY DEPENDS ON THE PRODUCT IT TOTALLY DEPENDS ON THE PRODUCT. ASSEMBLY MEMBER FLOOR SOMETIMES NO THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- CENTER I THINK IT'S PROBABLY SAFE TO SAY WHEN YOU FIRST GOT ELECTED THAT YOU WOULDN'T JUST GO DOWN RECYCLING PROBABLY WASN'T THE REASON I NOW FROM HOUSE I KNOW YOU HAVE. RUINED MY LIFE ABSOLUTELY BECOME RUSSIA AND I THINK IT'S KIND OF COOL- BECAUSE IT IS SUCH A HUGE PROBLEM AND YOU HAVE DONE AN INCREDIBLE JOB OF TRYING TO FIND BALANCE. SO I WANTED TO MAKE SURE- TO SAY THAT TO YOU PERSONALLY BECAUSE I DO BELIEVE THAT WHOLEHEARTEDLY WE'VE HAD MANY CONVERSATIONS ON MULTIPLE TRIPS TALK ABOUT THIS AMAZING TOPIC I AM CURIOUS THOUGH LIKE ON THE LIMITED RESIN A COUPLE TIMES YOU KNOW WHAT IT TAKES TO TAKE A QUARTER COULD NOT RECYCLE PRODUCT WE KNOW THAT WE CAN RECYCLE PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING IF WE REDUCE IT DOWN BACK DOWN TO. YOU KNOW PUREST FORM INTERESTED WE CAN INJECT THAT AGAIN AND MAKE A PRODUCT OUT OF THAT AGAIN. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE DO NOT HAVE A TON OF THOSE FACILITIES AVAILABLE TO DO THIS. AND THIS IS ONE THING THAT I AM VERY CONCERNED ABOUT IS AS WE REMOVE ALL THE STUFF FROM THE STREAM THAT I COMPLETELY AGREE THAT WE NEED TO. WE DO NOT HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE IN PLACE TO ACTUALLY DEAL WITH THIS TO TAKE THESE QUOTE UNQUOTE BECAUSE WE ALL KNOW THAT PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING IS RECYCLABLE TO A CERTAIN DEGREE WE CAN REDUCE THAT DOWN TO A PETROLEUM PRODUCT. AND REUSE IT AGAIN WE DO NOT HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO DO THAT WHICH IS WHY WE SHIP IT OVERSEAS AND LET THEM DEAL WITH IT. SO I AM CURIOUS WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON. TRYING TO BUILD UP THE INFRASTRUCTURE. WITHIN OUR STATE. TO DEAL WITH THIS BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT PART OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO FIX- I ACTUALLY AGREE- THERE THERE ISN'T INFRASTRUCTURE CHALLENGE- I GUESS ONE OF THE QUESTIONS BECOMES. TO WHAT EXTENT ESPECIALLY FOR THE FOR THE TECHNICALLY RECYCLABLE BUT VERY HARD TO RECYCLE PRODUCTS TO WHAT EXTENT IS IT WORTH. REALLY DOUBLING DOWN ON INVESTING IN THAT PARTICULAR TYPE OF STRUCTURE AS OPPOSED TO ENCOURAGING US PRODUCERS TO MOVE TO MORE RECYCLABLE PRODUCTS SO THAT'S ANOTHER PART OF THE COST BENEFIT BECAUSE THERE ARE AS I SAY. WELL YOU'RE RIGHT EVERYTHING TO SOME EXTENT IS RECYCLABLE LEAST THE ONES WITH THIS YOU KNOW THE RECYCLING SYMBOLS ON THEM. SOME ARE MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE TO RECYCLE. THAN OTHERS AND SO SHOULD WE BE MORE YAK SHIFTING PEOPLE TOWARD THE MORE RECYCLABLE STUFF. OUT TO THE EXTENT FEASIBLE- BUT YOUR UPS RIGHT THE RESEARCH IS A BIG PART OF THIS I THINK YOU KNOW ONE OF THE ONE OF THE THOUGHTS I THINK AS WE- ARE BUT WITH BILLS LIKE THIS BUT CERTAINLY- CERTAINLY WITH SB FIFTY FOUR. AB TEN EIGHTY- THE IDEA HAS BEEN TO TRY TO CREATE AN ATMOSPHERE. WHERE THERE'S A REAL INCENTIVE. ACTUALLY PRODUCE THEIR PRODUCTS WITH THE MIND TOWARD RECYCLING. AND AGAIN THE COLLECTION PROCESS IN THE SORTING PROCESS WITH THE MIND TOWARD RECYCLING. I'M SO YOU KNOW IT'S A IT'S A- AND I WILL SAY THERE ARE A LOT OF PLACES AROUND THE WORLD WITH THE FREELY TAKING MORE AGGRESSIVE ACTION IN THIS AREA WHERE THE- WHERE THE PRODUCERS. HAVE CREATED. COME HOLISTIC SYSTEMS. AND BECAUSE THEY KNOW THEIR OWN PRODUCTS THEY'RE ABLE TO- TO BUILD. A COLLECTION SORTING SYSTEM AND AN ULTIMATELY RECYCLING SYSTEM THAT THAT IS MORE COST EFFECTIVE. THAN THE SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE. SO BUT YOU KNOW I KNOW THIS INFRASTRUCTURE CONVERSATION IS HAPPENING IN A ROBUST MANNER- ON BOTH BOTH SIDES OF OUR BUILDING. AND IF IT IS ACTUALLY AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THE STORY- BUT THE PRODUCERS HAVE TO BE AT THE TABLE AND THEY HAVE TO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION. I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH THAT I THINK YOU KNOW I JUST I WAS USING MY BACKGROUND AND COMING FROM THE OUTSIDE WORLD. YOU THIS CHARACTERISES THE STICK APPROACH SEEMS TO REALLY WORK. AND I YOU KNOW IF WE CAN ENCOURAGE THE PRODUCERS THE MANUFACTURE OF THESE PRODUCTS AND COME ALONG LIKE A PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP TO BUILD THESE KIND OF INSTRUCTORS THAT ARE REQUIRED TO DO THIS. YES IT IS A TREMENDOUS COST TO RECYCLE SOME OF THE HARDER- PRODUCTS YOU KNOW WE UNDERSTAND THAT. BUT IF THE STATE IS GOING TO MAKE THIS A PRIORITY THEY WERE GOING TO DROP THESE MANDATES. BUT I THINK WE NEED TO PARTNER WITH OUR INDUSTRIES- AT A STATE. LEVEL TO GET THIS THESE INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THE FACILITIES UP AND RUNNING AS QUICK AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE OTHERWISE. WE'RE GONNA KEEP FIGHTING THE SAME BATTLE AND WE CAN KEEP WONDERING WHY NOTHING'S REALLY CHANGED AND PUTTING IT ALL ON THE BACK OF INDUSTRY FOR THE INDUSTRY TO DEAL WITH IT. I DON'T THINK IS THE RIGHT. WAY BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY BUT THE COST OF LIVING ISSUE. I MEAN THE OTHER DAY IF INDUSTRY HAS TO PAY X. AMOUNT DOLLARS MORE FREE PACKAGE TO PACKAGE SOMETHING THAT MY COMMUNITY BUYS- THAT IS PROBLEMATIC O I APPRECIATE YOUR EFFORTS IN THIS AND- LOOK FORWARD TO IT AS IT MOVES FORWARD. MY ITS OWNER IT BUT IF I MAY IT IS ALREADY ACOSTA LIVING ISSUE AND IT'S HITTING OUR CONSTITUENTS RIGHT NOW. I AS I MENTIONED SEVENTY SOMETHING LIKE SEVENTY PERCENT- A NEW A NEARLY THREE QUARTERS OF CITIES ARE ABOUT TO INCREASE THEIR RATES FOR WASTE COLLECTION.

ALL RIGHT WELL I MEAN I'VE I'VE READ IT AND PRESENT WHEN YOU'RE READY YEAH WE YOU KNOW WE DID HAVE A STRONG BIPARTISAN VOTE OVER IN THE ASSEMBLY ON THE SENATE SIDE BY FOR THIS BILL I BASICALLY THIS THIS- YOU KNOW- THE- SO. SO THE CODE THE BECAUSE THE COMMISSION IS TASKED WITH- ENFORCING THE COASTAL ACT- YOU. ORIGINALLY THEY ONLY GAVE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL THE RIGHT TO ENFORCE THE ACT. THEN SENATOR ATKINS I GUESS I SAID THAT TIME ASSEMBLYMEMBER ATKINS RAN A BILL THAT WOULD- GIVE. THE COASTAL ACT BECAUSE THE COMMISSION THE RIGHT TO ENFORCE ACCESS VIOLATIONS. I'M INTERESTINGLY THAT DRAMATICALLY DECREASED THE COST OF LITIGATION AND- AND DISPUTES. AND THEY ENDED UP RESOLVING A LOT OF DISPUTES MUCH MORE QUICKLY AND THIS IS BASICALLY THIS BASICALLY EXTENDS THE BILL TO INCLUDE- ALL VIOLATIONS OF THE COASTAL ACT. I BELIEVE BILL THAN A LOT OF PROTECTIONS WE WORK CLOSELY- YOU KNOW WITH THEM. AT THE CHERRY THE ASSEMBLY SIDE EFFECTS PRESENTS A COMMUNITY THAT OFTENTIMES. HAS CONFLICT WITH THE BECAUSE THE COMMISSION WE BUILT IN SOME SOME MORE PROTECTIONS FOR FOLKS WE PUT IN SOME- SOME LONGER TIME LINES. ARE GRACE PERIOD IT'S ADDRESS- BUT BUT ULTIMATELY THIS IS ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT OUR COASTAL ACT IS- IS EFFECTIVE. AND IT'S ALSO ABOUT- YOU KNOW IT'S ALSO ABOUT ABOUT IMPROVING EFFICIENCY AND LOWERING COSTS- OVER THE COMMISSION. I HAVE WITH ME HERE TODAY TO SUPPORT SPEAK OF THE BILL.

HAS ADMINISTRATIVE AND WE FORTY. BUT THE COMMISSION. FIVE BACK TWENTY TEN WE HAD A- OF ONE THOUSAND HUNDRED TWENTY OPENS. THAT NUMBER IS AN BALLOONED TO ALMOST TWENTY SEVEN HUNDRED AND IT'S GROWING EVERY YEAR BECAUSE IT TAKES SUCH A LONG TIME. TO RESOLVE THE VIOLATIONS IF THERE'S NO FINANCIAL CONSEQUENCE FOR SLOW WALKING AT. IN TWENTY FOURTEEN THE LEGISLATURE ALLOWED ADMIN PENALTIES FOR CALLS LIKE VIOLATIONS INVOLVING PUBLIC pBALANCED APPROACH WHEREBY FIND COULD ONLY BE IMPOSED BY A VOTE OF THE FULL COMMISSION IN A PUBLIC HEARING. DALY FINES ARE CAPPED AT FIVE YEARS EVEN FOR VIOLATIONS THAT HAVE PERSISTED FOR MUCH LONGER. AND IF YOU CAN BE AVOIDED BY RESOLVING THE VOLUNTARILY AND MINOR AMENDMENTS VIOLATIONS ARE NOT SUBJECT TO PENALTIES AT ALL. ROCKFEST WORKS WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO RESOLVE 95% OF THE ACTUAL CASES WE ADDRESS VOLUNTARILY WITH NO FINE. AVERAGE TIME IS DROPPED FROM ALMOST THREE YEARS THE THREE MONTHS MORE THAN A QUARTER ARE RESOLVED NOW IN LESS THAN THIRTY DAYS.

AND THE HORROR STORIES ABOUT HOW THIS GUY WAS GOING TO FALL AND YET THE ARGUMENT WAS. EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED IS IT REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF PENALTIES YEAH CLEANED UP THE ACCESS ISSUES. THE PERFORMANCE HAS BEEN EXACTLY WHAT WAS CAPS TO THE TIME.

ORGANIZATIONS THAT WERE CONCERNED ABOUT A STATE AND AGENCY THAT WOULD BE ON ACCOUNTABLE AND HAVING THIS NEW POWER TO LEVY SANCTIONS AND YOU TO GO FROM A VERY CONTROVERSIAL BILL TO- TO HAVING NO OPPOSITION I THINK IT'S JUST TESTAMENT TO THE FACT THAT THE PROCESS HAS WORKED THAT IN FACT BECAUSE THE COMMISSION HAS EXERCISED ITS POWER RESPONSIBLY AND HAS NOT ABUSED IT CONTRARY TO. THE INITIAL CONCERNS WHEN THE WHEN THE PROPOSAL WAS FIRST MADE IN SO. I WOULD. YOU TO SAY THAT THIS IS A GREAT EXAMPLE OF A- OF- IMPAIRING THE STATE AGENCY- AND IN A RESPONSIBLE WAY TO ENFORCE OUR R.

THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- CENTER I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO GO WITH THIS- AND I DO APPRECIATE THE HARD WORK I DO HAVE- MY OWN CONCERNS ABOUT THE COASTAL COMMISSION ESPECIALLY SINCE- THERE ARE PENDING LAWSUITS- WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE OCEANIA DOING WRITERS CLAIMS- WE WITH THE FRIENDS OF THE OCEANIC TONES AND WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THAT SITUATION I DO- DOES RAISE CONCERNS- FONG. OVER USE OF POWER FROM THE COASTAL COMMISSION.

TO SUPPORT THE ADOPTION OF ZERO EMISSION TRUCKS BUSES AND OFF ROAD VEHICLES. HYDROGEN FUEL CELLS ARE AN IDEAL ALTERNATIVE FUEL SOLUTION TO ELECTRIFY MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY COMMERCIAL VEHICLES. AND THESE VEHICLES ARE NECESSARY COMPONENT TO ACHIEVING CALIFORNIA'S CLIMATE AND AIR QUALITY GOALS. HOWEVER THERE EXISTS THE KNOWLEDGE GAP REGARDED THE HYDROGEN INFRASTRUCTURE THAT IS REQUIRED FOR CALIFORNIA TO MEET ITS CARBON NEUTRALITY GOALS. STATE AGENCIES ENERGY UTILITIES AND THE LEGISLATURE WAX SPECIFIC KNOWLEDGE OF THE AMOUNT OF HYDROGEN FUELING INFRASTRUCTURE AND HYDROGEN FUEL PRODUCTION NEEDED TO MEET CALIFORNIA'S CLEAN AIR GOALS. SENATE BILL SIX FORTY THREE WILL HELP BRIDGE THE KNOWLEDGE GAP AND ALLOW CALIFORNIA TO ADEQUATELY PLAN AND IMPLEMENT HYDROGEN FUEL CELLS AS AN ALTERNATIVE ENERGY SOURCE THE ASSESSMENT REQUIRED BY THIS BILL WILL FOCUS ON. THREE ITEMS FOR ITEMS PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION INFRASTRUCTURE DISPENSING AND DISTRIBUTION EQUIPMENT STORAGE EQUIPMENT SUPPORTING HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY AREAS OF COLLABORATION ACROSS HYDROGEN SECTORS FOR EXAMPLE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ONCE AGAIN PRODUCTION STORAGE AND DISTRIBUTION.

FRIEDMAN GARCIA MATHIS HI MATHIS AYE MCCARTY MURATSUCHI HIGH ROAD TO GI SO YOUR CHILD HI SO YOUR T&lt;c.cyan&gt; STONE STONE I&lt;/c&gt; WOULD. WOULD I. SEVEN ZERO SEVEN ZERO WILL LEAVE THAT OPEN UP FOR ONE OF YOUR MANAGER MEMBERS THANK YOU THANK YOU. C. NEXT WE HAVE ITEM SIX SB ONE PRESENTED BY OF SENATOR LAYERED WELCOME. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS- I'M PRESENTING US SENATE BILL ONE ON BEHALF OF THE SENATE PRO TEMPTODAY THING AND- I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY AND I'LL BEGIN BY ACCEPTING AS AUTHORS AMENDMENTS TO TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS THAT ARE RECOMMENDED BY THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. I THINK IF I COULD MAYBE BEGAN. IT IN A PERSONAL WAY WHEN I WAS A MEMBER OF THIS COMMITTEE- I INTRODUCED WHAT WAS I THINK THE FIRST BILL IN THE LEGISLATURE ON THE SUBJECT OF SEA LEVEL RISE. AND WHEN I DID THAT IT WAS DESIGNED TO ADD TO GENERAL PLANS ACROSS THE STATE FOR CITIES AND COUNTIES ALONG THE COAST OF PLANNING MEASURE FOR DOING SEA LEVEL RISE AND WHEN I GOT TO THE SENATE BOB WHICH OF COURSE WAS ON REASONABLE. AT THE TIME- THEY BASICALLY SAID HALF THE STAKEHOLDER SAID IF YOU DON'T HAVE A SPECIFIC BASELINE WE WON'T MOVE THIS BILL ALONG AND THE OTHER HALF OF THE STAKEHOLDER SAID WE WANT TO SPECIFIC BASELINE OR ELSE THIS BILL WAS IT MEANINGFUL I COULDN'T MOVE THE BILL OUT OF THE SENATE. AND THEN YOU FAST FOR TWO OR THREE YEARS AND I'M NATURAL RESOURCES SECRETARY IN CHARGE OF THE FIRST SCIENCE STUDY ON SEA LEVEL RISE WHICH ALLOWED US TO HAVE THE INFORMATION TO SET A BASELINE. AND WE DID THAT AND THE OTHER THING THAT WAS INTERESTING. IS WHEN WE- HAVE THE OCEAN PROTECTION COUNCIL MEETING. TO ACCEPT THAT SCIENTIFIC STUDY ON SEA LEVEL RISE IT WAS GAVELED TO ORDER AT NINE O'CLOCK WHEN THE TSUNAMI HIT THE CALIFORNIA COAST AT EIGHT AM THAT MORNING COMING FROM JAPAN. WHICH ACCENTUATED THE EXACT ISSUES OF SEA LEVEL RISE- BECAUSE- IT IS NOT JUST THE RISING SEASON IT'S BEEN EIGHT TO NINE INCHES SINCE THE OF THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION IN CALIFORNIA. IT'S THE EXTREME OF THAT THE EXTREME EVENT REALLY DRIVES IT HOME. AND THE OTHER PIECE OF IT IS THE CALIFORNIA COAST IS VERY DIFFERENT. SO IN THAT TSUNAMI- THERE WERE TWO PORTS THAT REALLY TOOK A MAJOR HIT CRESCENT CITY IN DEL NORTE COUNTY. AND SANTA CRUZ IN MY HOME CITY. AND TWO COMPLETELY DIFFERENT AREAS AND SO WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS SEA LEVEL RISE YOU HAVE SOME AREAS LIKE ASSEMBLY MEMBER MULLINS DISTRICT WHERE. IN PACIFICA APARTMENT BUILDINGS HAVE BEEN FALLING INTO THE SEA BECAUSE OF SANDY SOILS AND OTHER DISTRICTS THAT THAT SOME OF US REPRESENT THAT HAVE ROCKY PROMONTORY SORRY OF THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY WHICH HAS MARSHES AND PRESENTS HOLD DIFFERENT ISSUES. AND SO THE QUESTION IS HOW DO YOU ADDRESS IT AND THIS BILL IS THE NEXT STEP IN THAT CONTINUE ON. BECAUSE SB ONE ESTABLISHES FOR THE FIRST TIME IN CALIFORNIA LAW NEW PLANNING IMPLEMENTATION AND PUBLIC AGENCY COORDINATION REQUIREMENTS TO ADDRESS THE IMPACT OF SEA LEVEL RISE. REQUIRES THE COASTAL COMMISSION TO ADOPT AND PERIODICALLY UPDATE STANDARDS TO USE AND LOCAL AND REGIONAL COASTAL PLANNING IN ORDER TO. IDENTIFY ASSESS AND MITIGATE C. LEVEL RISE. IT ESTABLISHES A NEW CROSS GOVERNMENT COLLABORATIVE WITHIN THE OCEAN PROTECTION COUNCIL. TO ENSURE THE IMPACTS OF SEA LEVEL RISE ARE ANTICIPATED IN A DRESS BEYOND SIMPLY ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS BUT ALSO BY OUR TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE AGENCIES. AND FINALLY IT ESTABLISHES NEW FUNDING. CONTINGENT UPON APPROPRIATION IN THE ANNUAL BUDGET FOR STATE REGIONAL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO PLAN. FOR AND MITIGATE SEA LEVEL RISE BUT SEPARATELY IT EXPANDS THE EXISTING- ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE GRANT PROGRAM TO ENSURE THAT DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES MOST IMPACTED FROM SEA LEVEL RISE. HAVE A VOICE IN ACTIONS THAT THE GOVERNMENT TAKES TO ADDRESS THE CHALLENGE. AND SO- IT'S TEMPTING TO SEE SEA LEVEL RISE IS JUST ANOTHER ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUE BUT IN REALITY IT CUTS ACROSS MANY AREAS FROM TRANSPORTATION THE COMMERCE AND RECREATION- YEAH- IN MANY OF THE DISTRICTS OF PEOPLE SITTING ON THIS COMMITTEE AND IN MY DSTRICT- THE SEA LEVEL RISE AND CLIFF EROSION. WELL THE PRO TEM'S DISTRICT IT'S REALLY EVEN KILLED STROLLERS WALKING ON THE BEACH IT'S CUT OFF KEY RAIL TRANSPORTATION AND AS MR STONE MIGHT KNOW- I WAS ON THE CITY COUNCIL MAYOR IN SANTA CRUZ AND WE DESIGNED THE LIGHT HOUSE FIELD. STATE BEACH AND WE ALIENATED ONE OF THE SIGNIFICANT POLITICAL CONSTITUENTS AND SANTA CRUZ TO SURFERS BECAUSE WE WANTED TO MOVE TO ST BACK A LITTLE BIT FROM THE OCEAN. AND WE DID IN THE END AND THERE A COUPLE OF PLACES WHERE THE OCEAN AS HE RODE UP TO THE STREET THAT WE MOVE BACKED OVER THIRTY FIVE YEARS AGO SO THAT YOU CAN SEE. IT IN ONE LIFE HOW THAT HAPPENS AND SO SB ONE PRESENTS THIS COMMITTEE IN CALIFORNIA WITH AN OPPORTUNITY. TO GET OUT FRONT OF THIS IMPORTANT- OF CLIMATE CHANGE IN OUR MAGNIFICENT STATE. AND I WOULD RESPECT AND I'VE FOUGHT. OKAY THANK YOU. WE ARE READY. TO HEAR FROM WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL- WE HAVE UP TO WITNESSES- BY TELEPHONE MODERATOR Q. PLEASE OPEN UP THE LINES FOR SERRA A MEANS THAT DAY THE COASTAL COMMISSIONER AND JENNIFER SAVAGE FROM THE SURFRIDER FOUNDATION. GOOD MORNING MADAME CHIANG COMMITTEE MEMBERS JENNIFER SAVAGE CALIFORNIA POLICY MANAGER FOR THE THIRD BETTER FOUNDATION TO HARM SEALABLE RIFLE DUE TO CALIFORNIA PEOPLE ACADEMY IN OCEAN RIGHT THAT CAN MAKE CLEAR IN THE STATE- REPORT. IF WE DO NOT TAKE QUICK ACTION WE WILL DO THAT BEACHES AND HEALTH FRONTLINE COMMUNITIES ATTEND OUR ECONOMY AND ALLOW SOME OF THE MOST BIO DIVERSE COASTLINE IN THE WORLD TO DISAPPEAR. IN PRACTICAL TERMS THIS MEANS THE MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS CAN GET THE DIRTY WORK RECREATE ADMIRING OTHER WHAT I FIND JUST A MOMENT OUR TREASURE COAST LINE WILL NO LONGER HAVE BEACH IS TO GO TO. IT MEANS THAT THOSE WITH THE FEWEST OPTIONS WILL SEPARATE THE MOST DISLOCATION AND BY INCREASING BIODIVERSITY AT THE COOK TO ECOSYSTEMS MANAGEMENT HELP YOU LEVEL RISE WILL WASH AWAY OUR COUNTY BEACHES AND DOWN A ROCKY REEF. SOMETHING WE CANNOT LET HAPPEN IF WE ARE TO MEET OUR GOAL OF PROTECTING BIODIVERSITY TO THIRTY BY THIRTY AFTER. WE NEED SB ONE NOW THE BILL BUILT ON THE PRINCIPLE OF TREND LINES TAKE ACTION SIGNED BY SEVENTEEN STATE AGENCIES MISSIONS FACULTY LEVEL RIGHTS ISSUES ON THE FRONT LINES USING PROVEN INSTITUTIONS OF COOKERY COURSES MANAGEMENT AND PROVIDE DESPERATELY NEEDED ANNUAL FUNDING TO LOCAL REGIONAL AND TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS AND COMMUNITIES FACING EXISTENTIAL ADAPTATION CHALLENGES. THE LONGER WE FOR CO AND ASKING A PLANNING GOVERNANCE AND PHYSICAL ADAPTATIONS NECESSARY TO RESPOND TO RISING SEAS AND MORE EXPENSIVE THAT ADAPTATION WILL BECOME SB ONE GIVES US A SHOT IT STATING OUR BEACHES. BUILDING ON CUTS TO ACCESS EQUITY CONSERVING BIODIVERSITY PARKING ACOSTA CONNIE INTO THE FUTURE IN SHORT THE BILL WOULD ENSURE CALIFORNIA'S NOT DEFINING AND DEMOCRATIC BASE OUR CODE IS PROTECTED LIKE THE TREASURY DEBT. FOR ALL THE REASONS TODAY WE ASK FOR YOUR IPHONE ON SB. ONE THANK YOU. SIX WITNESS. GOOD MORNING. YES GOOD MORNING MY NAME MY NAME IS TERRY EVAN AT I'M ON TO HAVE TO AT ONE TWO. I THE IMPACT IT RIGHT ON IN A AND FOR NEED LEGAL AND POLICY REFORM FORGET YEARS SINCE I FIRST OF AS DURING LAW SCHOOL NOW I THE PRIVILEGE OF SERVING ON THE CALIFORNIA COAST OKAY AND THAT WAS THE OBSERVE COASTAL CLIMATE I NEEDS HI OUT ON THE BASIS THAT. WE KNOW IMPACT I'M NOT HAPPEN. ANGER AT THE FAR OFF TURN RIGHT INTO TWENTY FIFTY AND TWENTY ONE HUNDRED MIGHT IMPLY. BUT INSIDE ED PREDICTABLE EMERGENCIES ASSOCIATED WITH EXTREME WEATHER AND ULTRA HIGH TIDE EVENTS. I WANT TO SPEAK TODAY IN PARTICULAR ABOUT THE IMPACT UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR IN CALIFORNIA. MANY OF THEM HAVE BEEN EXCLUDED FROM COASTAL AREAS THROUGH STATE SANCTIONED EMINENT DOMAIN. RELEGATED TO AREAS VULNERABLE TO FLOODING THE REDLINING AND FEDERAL HOUSING PROJECTS AND ELEVEN LARGELY PARK FOR AREAS AND CAN ACT OF COASTAL AREAS. BY PUBLIC TRANSPORT BIKING OR WALKING. SEALEVEL RISE AND STATE ACTION OR INACTION INCLUDING WHAT THE COMMITTEE DOES TODAY. WILL PERPETUATE INEQUITIES AND DISPARITIES ARCTIC THAT IF WE DO NOT KNOW FOR IT WOULD COMPREHENSIVE REFORMS LIKE THAT AND I SEE ONE. LOWER INCOME RESIDENTS AND THOSE WHO LIVE IN RENTAL UNITS AND PLACES LIKE TO LOOK AT THAT IMPORT WHY NIIMI I'M MORE LIKELY TO BE DISPLACED BY FLOODING RELATED IMPACTS AS COMPARED TO PROPERTY OWNERS BECAUSE THEY LACKED THE FUNDS AN ABILITY. TO REBUILD AND HAVE LESS CONTROL OVER THEIR SAFETY AND OFTEN HAVE LIMITED ACCESS TO INSURANCE. IN AREAS VULNERABLE TO SEA LEVEL RISE LIKE THEM FUTURE- AND LONG BACH. HE WALKED FURTHER REDUCE ACCESS TO PUBLIC TRUST RESOURCES AND COASTAL RECREATION AREA. ALL RESIDENTS PARTICULARLY THOSE RESIDENTS LIVING AND LAND. THE MAY ACT THAT THE BEACH RARELY AND BUY POT BIKING OR WALKING. IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT SB ONE DOES NOT CREATE NEW OR ADDITIONAL AUTHORITY FOR THE COASTAL COMMISSION. IT SIMPLY CLARIFIES AND CODIFIES OUR EXISTING AUTHORITY OVER COASTAL HAZARDS BY SPECIFYING THE LEVEL RIGHT CAPTURED IN THE COASTAL ACT. AND IN DOING SO ESTABLISHING NEW FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES FOR STATE AND LOCAL AGENCIES TO PARTNER TO ADDRESS THE LEVEL RIGHTS. AT THE ONE ENACT THE FIRST COMPREHENSIVE PEOPLE RIGHT PROGRAM IN STATE GOVERNMENT AND ESTABLISH ITS FUNDING FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO COMMUNITIES TO PLANT CORN MEDICATE SEALEVEL RISE. IT WOULD MAKE UP TO ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AVAILABLE FOR LOCAL ADAPTATION IMPROPER PREPAREDNESS WORK. THIS FUNDING IS ESSENTIAL FOR THE COASTAL COMMISSION AND OUR PARTNER AGENCIES ACROSS THE STATE TO MAKE THEIR COMMUNITIES MORE RESILIENT TO FEEL ALL RIGHT. WE KNOW THAT ONE DOLLAR SPENT TODAY. NEXT YEAR THE FOLLOWING AN ADAPTATION OF PREPAREDNESS. CAN SAVE A SIX DOLLARS ON EMERGENCY RESPONSE DOWN THE LINE. SB ONE WOULD ALSO EXPLICITLY ADDS THE LEVEL RISE TO THE EPA ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE GRANT PROGRAM SENDING CRITICALLY NEEDED FUNDS TO DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. EVERY YEAR THAT WE CANNOT KICK OVER YET TIME THANK YOU IN MY LAP THAT. THANK EVERY YEAR THAT WE DO NOT TAKE ACTION TO PREPARE STATE PRETTY ALL RIGHT MEANS THE FAT OF OPPORTUNITIES AND CHOICES LAW. AND WE KNOW THAT THESE LOSSES WILL BE FELT MOST SHARPLY BY DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. I URGE YOUR SUPPORT FOR THAT NOW THANK YOU. THANK YOU. I'M WE DON'T HAVE ANY I WITNESSES REGISTERED IN OPPOSITION SO WE'LL NOW OPEN IT UP FOR ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION OF THIS BILL ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES IN THE HEARING ROOM C.

SB SIX NINETEEN WILL PROVIDE PROCESS FOR CITIES TO WORK WITH CAL RECYCLE TO GET WHEN YOU'RE RELIEF FROM PENALTIES. IF THEY HAVE MADE REASONABLE EFFORTS TO COMPLY. BUT NOT MET THE JNUARY FIRST TWO THOUSAND TWENTY TWO IMPLEMENTATION DEADLINE. IN BURBANK WE ARE WORKING ON STARTING A FOOD WASTE PROGRAM. IN OUR DOWNTOWN AND ESTABLISHING A COMPOST FACILITY AT OUR LANDFILL. BUT THERE'S MUCH MORE WORK TO BE DONE. ISSUES INCLUDE ESTABLISHING THE INFRASTRUCTURE ACTUALLY MOVE EVERY SEAFOOD WASTE. AS WELL SETTING BASELINES FOR THE GENERATORS LIKE RESTAURANTS WERE JUST STARTING O GET BACK TO. PRE CODE LEVEL OPERATIONS. AS WELL AS SETTING UP EFFECTIVE PUBLIC OUTREACH PROGRAMS TO ENSURE CONSTITUENTS KNOW WHAT IS COMING. AND HOW TO COMPLY. TO BE CLEAR SB SIX NINETEEN IS NOT ROLLING BACK AND REPEALING THE STATE'S ORGANIC WASTE DIVERSION REGULATIONS AND THE BILL HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANTLY REVISED SINCE. SINCE ITS ORIGINAL INTRODUCTION TO ADDRESS OPPOSITION CONCERNS. IT IS A GOOD MODIFICATION OF PUBLIC POLICY THAT MAKES SENSE. AND WILL STILL KEEP THE ULTIMATE GOAL INTACT THAT CONCLUDES MY COMMENTS AND I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME AND CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU I'M NEXT WE HAVE ONE WITNESS IN OPPOSITION. MIZUHO YEN YEN YEP.

THANK YOU ROOM I HAVE TALKED TO JURISDICTIONS FROM NORTH CULTURE SO CALL FROM COAST TO INLAND INCLUDING SOME OF THOSE THAT SAID YOUR SUPPORT LETTERS FOR SB SIX NINETEEN.

MUCH MORE OFTEN ICT POLITICAL FEAR ABOUT THE RACING COLLECTION HE- FOR INSTANCE ALONG THE STATE'S WEALTHIEST CITY HAVE A PROBLEM WITH RACING CHIU DOLLAR FIFTY CENTS A MONTH. FOR HEALTH HELP. YET ACCORDING TO LA TIMES THE TYPICAL AMERICAN ADULT WICKS ABOUT THE SWEET DOLLAR FIFTY CENTS WORTH OF FOOD EVERYDAY.

ANY QUESTIONS ASSEMBLY MEMBER C. ARE TOLD BY. SENATOR LARRY THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL AND WORKING WITH THE CALIFORNIA LEAGUE OF CITIES I KNOW THEY WERE. DESPERATELY TRYING TO ADDRESS- THIS THIS IS THE UNDERLYING BILL- EARLY ON- BECAUSE OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF IT AND ITS EFFECT ON CITIES- AND ALSO THAT THE OTHER. STAKEHOLDERS INVOLVED- IT AND I'M JUST I WOULD LIKE TO SUPPORT THIS BILL AND ALSO LIKE TO BE ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR. ON THIS ON THIS BILL AND BECAUSE I SUPPORT WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE BUT IT ALSO FALLS WOEFULLY SHORT OF ADDRESSING THESE ISSUES THAT THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE HAS- LAID UPON ON ON THE CITY'S- YEAH THERE ARE ISSUES WITH PROCARE THAT PROCUREMENT. OF THE ORGANIC MATERIAL- THAT HAVE. HAVE YET TO BE EVEN DISCUSSED. AND ALSO THE MANDATORY COLLECTION- FOR REMOTE LOOK AT JURISDICTIONS OR CITIES THAT. ARE OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE- THE LIFE BEING ONE OF THOSE CITIES. FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO COMPLY WITH THE ELEMENTS OF THIS ACTUALLY PUSHES THEM INTO AN AREA WHERE THERE BEING LESS ENVIRONMENTALLY. AND RESPONSIBLE THAN IF THEY WERE TO BE COMPLYING WITH THIS SO THOSE ARE OTHER THINGS THAT NEED TO BE DONE REPORTING TIMELINES ARE TOTALLY UNREALISTIC FOR THIS BILL- I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I THINK WE'VE LEARNED A LESSON AND ONE OF THE BILLS WERE GONNA HERE IN A LITTLE BIT. WHICH IS SB FIVE NINETY SIX THE PERFECT EXAMPLE. OF ENGAGING THE- INDUSTRIES THAT ARE INVOLVED IN TRYING TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN- EARLY ON IN OFTEN- TO GET THEIR INPUT ON WHAT WORKS AND WHAT DOESN'T. BECAUSE ULTIMATELY IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT THIS PROGRAM WORKS. AND AND SO I THINK- THERE'S A LESSON TO BE LEARNED THERE. AND I HOPE THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS PROBLEM BECAUSE- WE CAN DELAY THE IMPLEMENTATION A LITTLE BIT WITH THIS BILL. ARE SOME OF THE ELEMENTS OF IT. BUT IF WE DON'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT THE OTHER STUFF WE'RE GONNA BE RIGHT BACK HERE AGAIN NEXT YEAR TRYING TO DEAL WITH THE EXACT SAME PROBLEMS- SO I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT YOU TOOK THIS ON. AND AND WORKED WITH THE LEAGUE AND ADDRESS THIS ISSUE- WE HAVE MORE WORK TO DO ON IT AND I LOOK FORWARD TO BE ABLE TO WORK WITH YOUR OFFICE AND IN TRYING TO SUPPORT WHATEVER IT IS THAT. YOU WOULD LIKE TO DO IN THE FUTURE CONTINUE TO DO AND- YEAH TO ADDRESS THIS IT REALLY IMPORTANT ISSUE. SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER WHAT. I THANK YOU CENTER LAYER FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD- I MY HOME COUNTY CINEMA COUNTY HAD A ROBUST- COMPOST FACILITY- AT THE LANDFILL THAT OPERATED FOR OVER A DECADE- WE HAVE- IT WAS SHUT DOWN THERE WERE LAWSUITS NEIGHBORS DIDN'T LIKE IT- WE HAVE A CONTINUED GROWING PROBLEM WITH ORGANIC WASTE YOU CAN'T COMPOST AT ALL AT HOME YOU KEEP AND YET WERE UNDER UNDER SOME OF THESE CHALLENGES. JUST THIS MONTH NEGOTIATIONS FELL THROUGH FOR ANOTHER FACILITY TO BE OPENED UP THROUGH FINANCING SO- SO THESE YOU KNOW THERE ARE CITIES AND COUNTIES THAT ARE ABSOLUTE TRYING TO DO THE RIGHT THING CITING THESE FACILITIES IS CHALLENGING- BUILDING THEM IS COSTLY- WE WANT TO DO THE RIGHT THING AND WE'RE WE'VE BEEN TRYING SINCE YOU KNOW SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN WHEN LAWSUIT SHUT DOWN AT THE EXISTING FACILITIES SO I APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING THIS FORWARD. I AM ALSO IT'S A SHAME IT'S TAKEN FOUR YEARS FOR THE RAGS TO COME OUT I THINK- BUT THAT'S A WHOLE NOTHER ISSUE- BUT I APPRECIATE PROJECT WORK ON THIS THANK YOU. THANK YOU. WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE YES I THINK- THE COMMENTS GAVE TWO DISTINCT OUR PERSPECTIVES THE END OF THE GREAT THING IS THAT WHEN I STARTED DOING THIS BILL IT HAS MORPHED IN A COUPLE OF WAYS ONE IS TO DEAL JUST WITH THE PENALTIES SO THAT CITIES CAN STILL MAKE THE REASONABLE AFFECTED THOSE THAT HAVE INVESTED THEIR INVESTMENT IS STILL GOOD IN THEIR INVESTMENT IS STILL VALID. AND I OR WHETHER IT WAS PART OF THIS EFFORT BUT NOT THE FACT THAT TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS HAS GONE INTO THE BUDGET TO DO THIS WILL MAKE A FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE AND WE ARE STILL WORKING ON SOME OF THESE ISSUES AND WILL TAKE AMENDMENTS IN APPROPRIATIONS IF WE NEED TO DO OR FURTHER ON DOWN THE LINE. AND THERE MAY EVEN BE A NEED TO DO SOMETHING IF THE BUDGET- IS ADOPTED WITHOUT LANGUAGE IN THE TRAILER BILL TO DEAL WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THAT BUDGET FUNDING AND SO WE WILL USE THIS BILL TO ADDRESS ALL THOSE ISSUES ARE PER SHARE. AGAIN TAKING ME- THANK YOU WE HAVE A MOTION FROM ASSEMBLY MEMBER FLORISTS SECONDED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER SU CHI THE MOTION IS DUE PASSED TO APPROPRIATIONS SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL ON ITEM ELEVEN SB SIX NINETEEN BY SENATOR LAYERED MEMBERS RIVAS HI RIVERSIDE FLORA FLORA I CHAU.

NOW WILL GO BACK TO FILE ORDER. WE'RE ON ITEM SEVEN- SB FIVE NINETY SIX BY IT SENATOR BACK BECKER WELCOME TO NATURAL RESOURCES. THANK YOU JERRY THIS AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. THIS BILL IS ABOUT REDUCING GREENHOUSE GIMMICK EMISSIONS AND THE CEMENT AND CONCRETE SECTORS IN CALIFORNIA. CONCRETE AND CEMENT ARE VITAL FOR OUR ECONOMY IN FACT YOU ARE HERE TO MASON STEP RECENT STUDY ESTIMATED A CONCRETE ACCOUNTS FOR HALF THE WEIGHT OF EVERYTHING EVER MADE BY HUMANITY. IN OUR HISTORY. I'M FORTY IS ALSO A MAJOR SOURCE OF GREENHOUSE GASES ACCOUNTED FOR SEVEN PERCENT. OF CARBON EMISSIONS GLOBALLY. AND THE SECOND LEADING. SOURCE OF INDUSTRIAL MISSIONS HERE IN CALIFORNIA. MOOSE'S MISSIONS RUN 90% ACTUALLY COME FROM MAKING CEMENT WHICH IS THE GLUE THAT HOLDS CONCRETE TOGETHER. AND SINCE WE'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO BE INCREASING OUR USE OF CONCRETE CEMENT NOT DECREASING. ITS IMPORT WE FIGURED HOW TO TRANSITION- Q. MAKING IT WITH FAR LESS IMPACT ON OUR CLIMATE. GOOD NEWS IS THAT TECHNOLOGIES AND PROCESSES NOW EXIST FOR ACHIEVING LARGE REDUCTIONS IN EMISSIONS FROM CEMENT PRODUCTION. IN THE TO HAVE NOT BEEN DEPLOYED AT SCALE BECAUSE WE HAVE HAD THE RIGHT POLICIES IN PLACE TO BOTH ENCOURAGE EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS AND INCREASED DEMAND FOR LOW CARBON BUILDING PRODUCTS OF THIS BILL IS REALLY ABOUT ENCOURAGING THOSE EMISSIONS. ARE BACK WITH ANOTHER BILL WHICH IS OF THE DEMAND THE DEMAND SIDE FOR LOW CARBON. BUILDING PRODUCTS. EVERY WORD IN THIS BILL WE FOUND THIS MINISTRY TO BE A VERY WILLING PARTNER IN ACHIEVING THESE GOALS. AS LONG AS THEY CAN CREATE SUPPORTIVE POLICY ENVIRONMENT AND ADDRESS. BARRIERS THAT EXIST TODAY. EXACTLY CALIFORNIA NEVADA CEMENT ASSOCIATION PUBLISHES ON PAPER IN MARCH. FROM INJURIES COMMITMENT ACHIEVING CARBON NEUTRALITY. BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE AND IDENTIFYING OBSTACLES. SO THIS BILL AIMS TO CREATE THE RIGHT SUPPORT OF A POLICY ENVIRONMENT. TO ACHIEVE THAT GOAL OF CARBON NEUTRALITY BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE. AND IT DROVE THE STRATEGY FOR THE KEEPING THESE TARGETS WELL PROTECTING PRODUCERS. WHO DO SO FROM UNFAIR COMPETITION FROM OUT OF STATE PRODUCERS WILL NOT BE SUBJECT TO THE SAME RULES. THAT THE COMMITTEE- IN YOUR STEPS OPPOSED AMENDMENT TO CLARIFY THE CARD MAY ADJUST THE INTERIM TARGETS DURING THE TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT MID TERM CHECK AND NOT JUST PROPOSED TO AMEND THEM.

RECONNOITER THIS BILL IS ABOUT CREATING A POLICY ENVIRONMENT CONDUCIVE TO SHRINKING AND ULTIMATELY ELIMINATING AMOUNTS CARBON FOOTPRINT. THAT IS AN URGENT TASK CONCRETE IS THE MOST WIDELY CONSUMED MATERIAL ON EARTH AS A SENATOR NOTED CEMENT PRODUCTION ALONE CONTRIBUTES ABOUT 8% GLOBAL CO TWO OUTPUT. CEMEX FIGHT TO CALIFORNIA'S EMISSIONS PIPES MARC THAT IS OUR LARGEST INDUSTRIAL SOURCE OF CARBON POLLUTION AFTER OIL AND GAS AND OF COURSE GREENHOUSE GASES NO NO BORDER WE WILL REST MISSING OUR TARGETS IN A MEETING POLITICAL TO ESCALATING CLIMATE IMPACTS WE CONTINUE. TO OVERLOOK THE SECTOR. WE HAVE A COULD. INDUSTRY PARLANCE WE HAVE A CLEAR SO. THE BUILT OFF SUCCESS MODEL CALIFORNIA HAS EMPLOYED TO JUMPSTART INNOVATION IN OTHER SECTORS. BY SEVENTEEN THE GOLD CRITERIA IN LAYING OUT A PROCESS. WELL FORTY ROOM FOR AIR BEING STAKEHOLDERS TO PROVIDE INPUT ON THE BEST PASSPORT THROUGH WILL MAKE. THANKFULLY THAT PASSPORT IS COMING INTO FOCUS IMPROVED EFFICIENCY FUEL SEARCHING. INCREASED USE OF LESS POLLUTING EMISSIONS MATERIALS CAN ALL PROVIDE NEAR TERM PRODUCTION. WHILE FIGHTING INNOVATIONS IN TRANSFORM THE CARBON MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGIES HOLD. THE PROMISE TO ACHIEVE NET ZERO. PROBABLY NEEDED TO DEPLOYED THE COUNTRY WE HAVE LEFT FOR IT CLIMB. THAT IS WHAT FIVE NINE EXTRA. IT'S A FAIR AMOUNT TARGETS TO PROVIDE THE NEEDED CERTAINTY AND ECONOMIC INCENTIVES TO JUMPSTART INVESTMENT. ENSURES IMPORTS ARE COVERED TO PROVIDE A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD AND A PRIORITIZE ACTIONS THAT SERVE OTHER ESSENTIAL GOALS. SUCH AS IMPROVING LOCAL AIR QUALITY. LEVERAGING FEDERAL INCENTIVES TO SUPPORT ECONOMIC AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT. EVERYBODY HERE IS ALSO A FRAMEWORK THAT THE INDUSTRY IS READY TO EMBRACE AND INVEST IN THE MAKE CALIFORNIANS LOCALLY TO INCREASE DEMAND. KIND OF A SIGNIFICANT AND SHE MEANT AND ONE THAT IN OUR VIEW.

THANK YOU NEXT WILL MOVED TO QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE ALL START WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER MATHIS. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR SENATOR I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR. YOUR HARD WORKING IN EXPRESSLY MORE SO FOR WORKING WITH THE INDUSTRY- HERE TOO OFTEN THAN NOT WE SEE A LOT OF LEGISLATION THAT COMES UP WITH NEW REGULATIONS AND NEW THINGS. AND- WE DON'T ALWAYS SEE INDUSTRY SUPPORTING THE REGULATIONS THAT WERE PUTTING ON THEM AND WHEN WE DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE RECOGNIZE THAT AND THAT WE SUPPORT THAT BECAUSE A LOT OF TIMES I KNOW THE MEMBERS ON MY SIDE OF THE AISLE OR LIKE WHERE THE INDUSTRY GUYS AT WHAT'S GOING ON. IN SO I THINK IT'S WORTH WHILE TO KNOW YOUR HARD WORK IN GETTING THE INDUSTRY TO SUPPORT THIS- WE DO THIS A LOT OF THE AGRICULTURAL SIDE- WHERE A LOT OF MY WILL HOUSE AND BACKGROUND IS IN IN WHATEVER INDUSTRY SAYING HEY WE NEED YOUR HELP HERE THIS IS WHAT WE THINK WE CAN DO MOVING FORWARD IN THE LEGISLATOR. FOLLOWS THAT AND LISTENS TO THAT IT'S WORTH NOTING AND WORTH RECOGNIZING AND FOR THAT REASON I WILL BE SUPPORTING YOUR BILL. MOVING FORWARD THANK YOU. THANK YOU SOME REFERENCE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER FLORIDA. I THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR A CENTER AND I ALSO JUST KIND ON ECHO THE COMMENTS OF- MY COLLEAGUES. I THINK THIS IS THE- THE WAY OF THE FUTURE FOR INDUSTRIES WORKING TOGETHER WITH OUR ENVIRONMENTAL COMMUNITIES. TO DEVELOP SOLUTIONS THAT ARE SUSTAINABLE FOR EVERYBODY RIGHT. AND THIS IS SO EXCITING TO ME I MEAN YES COMING FROM AND I BACKGROUND WE'VE DONE THIS A LOT. WHEN I SPOKE WITH THE INDUSTRY THE SIEMENS FOCUSED ON THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE. I WAS INCREDIBLY ENCOURAGED THAT THEY WERE COMING TO THE TABLE THEY WERE BEING PROACTIVE HAVE A GREAT SO DO CARRIED LEGISLATION FOR THEM. SO I'M EXCITED TO SUPPORT THIS AND I THINK TO ALL THE OTHER INDUSTRIES OUT THERE. TAKE NOTE. BECAUSE THIS IS THE PATHWAY. ASSEMBLY MEMBER MURATSUCHI THANK YOU SENATOR BAKER I WANTED TO WELCOME YOU TO THE ASSEMBLY SIDE I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS ONE OF YOUR FIRST BILLS ON TO BE PRESENTING ON THE ASSEMBLY SIDE BUT- I'LL LOOK FORWARD TO. WORKING WITH YOU ON ON THIS AND MANY OTHER IMPORTANT BILLS THAT YOU'RE WORKING ON- I WANT TO. JOIN A THE BIPARTISAN APPRECIATION FOR YOU WORKING WITH THE- CALIFORNIA NEVADA CEMENT ASSOCIATION. AND I KNOW I NOTED THAT- IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS THAT- THE ASSOCIATION PUBLISHED A PAPER IN MARCH OF THIS YEAR AFFIRMING THE INDUSTRY'S COMMITMENT TO ACHIEVE CARBON NEUTRALITY BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE. AND AND SO LIKE I AGAIN I WOULD TO ECHO MY REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES IN THE- AND- THANKING THE ASSOCIATION FOR THEIR LEADERSHIP AND THEIR COMMITMENT TO. GET TO THIS IMPORTANT GOAL. I HAD A QUESTION. V. COMMITTEE AND ALSO IT'S ALSO TALKS ABOUT HOW. THERE WAS A- TWENTY NINETEEN REPORT CALIFORNIA CEMENT INDUSTRY FAILING TO FAILING THE CLIMATE CHALLENGE. WORD INDICATED THAT- THE CALIFORNIA CEMENT INDUSTRY. HAD THE SECOND HIGHEST CO TWO EMISSIONS INTENSITY AMONG THE COUNTRIES STUDIED. 57% HIGHER THAN THAT OF THE CEMENT INDUSTRY IN CHINA- DUE IN PART TO A HIGHER CLINKER TO CEMENT RACIAL I WAS WONDERING WHAT- WHAT CHINA IS DOING THAT WE'RE NOT DOING. I CAN SPEAK TO. I CAN'T SPEAK TO THE RATIO ITSELF- I WOULD SAY YOU KNOW THE ENERGY INTENSITY COMES FROM TWO PARTS ONE IS THE BUT 40% IS JUST BECAUSE VERY ENERGY INTENSIVE TO MAKE SO WHAT DO WE USE THAT AND I DON'T KNOW IF THAT ACTUALLY COUNTS FOR CHINA'S USE OF COAL IN MOST CASES TO MAKE- THEIR CEMENT. AND IT'S 60% IS THE PROCESS EMISSIONS SUCH AS THE PROSECUTION'S FOR MAKING A CEMENT AND THAT'S WHERE THE INNOVATION REALLY CAN COME IN IF YOU CAPTURE THAT CAN RESTORE THAT IN WILL BE ENCOURAGING THAT- IN THIS BILL SO- I CAN'T COME IN THE STUDY I DON'T KNOW IF THE WITNESSES ANY COMMENTS ON THAT BUT ICAN'T SAY I THINK THIS WILL MAKE US THE LEADER AND I'M VERY CONFIDENT THAT. WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEVEN COMMENT ON. WITNESS CERTAINLY. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO RESPOND. THAT REPORT THAT WAS RELEASED IN TWENTY NINETEEN PROVIDED SOME VERY MISLEADING INFORMATION AND UNEQUAL PERFORMANCE ARE UNABLE COMPARISONS TO THE TYPES OF CEMENT THAT'S PRODUCED IN CHINA VERSUS THE UNITED STATES. WE DO THINGS DIFFERENTLY HERE WE ALLOW THE CONCRETE PRODUCERS THAT BY CEMENT. TO ADD ADDITIONAL PRODUCTS TO REDUCE CARBON EMISSIONS THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN TO CALIFORNIA OR OTHER STATES SO IT'S REALLY TWO DIFFERENT TYPES OF PRODUCTION. SO IT'S AN UNFAIR COMPARISON ARE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MISTER MEMBERS SAY ARE TOP RIGHT I AGREE WITH EVERYTHING EVERYBODY HAS SAID ABOUT WORKING TOGETHER WITH THE INDUSTRY AND HOW MUCH EASIER THAT WITH THAT WORKS- AND IT ALSO IS BENEFICIAL TO ACTUALLY ACHIEVING SOME OF THESE GOALS WHETHER PEOPLE AGREE WITH THEM OR NOT- THOSE ARE THE GOALS AND- AND SO THE DAY I APPLAUD YOU FOR WORKING WITH THEM TO DO THAT- YOU KNOW ONE OF MY CONCERNS ALSO AND I THINK EVERYBODY SHOULD BE CONCERNED IS. IS TO AN AND I WOULD EXPECT THE CEMENT INDUSTRY WILL WILL HAVE A KEEN EYE TOWARD JUST AND THAT'S WHY IT'S IMPORTANT TO WORK WITH THEM IS IN IN OUR EFFORTS TO CREATE A MORE ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY CEMENT WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THE BUILDINGS LIKE THIS STATE OVERHEAD WHEN WE'RE HAVING EARTHQUAKES AND THINGS LIKE THAT- YOU SEE THE- THE EFFECTS OF SUB STANDARD CEMENT- PRODUCTS IN OTHER COUNTRIES WHEN THEY DO HAVE- DISASTERS THEY ARE MUCH LESS- RESILIENT THAN WE ARE. AND AND MUCH MORE LETHAL AND SO- AND I THINK THIS APPROACH ALLOWS THEM TO HAVE THAT INPUT AND BE ABLE TO- BALANCE THAT OUT WITHOUT HAVING A ONE SIDED APPROACH THAT LATER ON WE FIND OUT- WE'VE JUST WEAKENED THE INTEGRITY OF THE CEMENT PRODUCT AND- BEYOND- WHAT IS SAFE FOR OUR OUR PUBLICATIONS AT THE END OF THE DAY THAT SAFETY OF THE PUBLIC IS OF UTMOST IMPORTANCE SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR A BILL INTENDED SUPPORTED. TODAY BECAUSE OF THAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU ONE SENATOR BAKER YOU. BY A- FROM THE COMMITTEE. ON THIS BILL THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. SURE NOT JUST AT THE LAST MOMENT WHEN WE COME BACK WITH A CONCRETE BILL YOU'LL SEE. GENERALLY THE STATE PROCUREMENT PIECE OF IT. RUSSIAN MOVING FROM EXACTLY WHAT'S IN IT TO THE PERFORMANCE SPECIFICATIONS THAT'S REALLY WHAT'S IMPORTANT SO WE WANNA MAKE SURE. THAT THE PERFORMANCE OF THE SPECIFICATIONS ARE CLEAR AND THE SAFETY IS NOT COMPROMISED ANYWAY SO I APPRECIATE THAT. OVERALL IT'S JUST EXTREMELY. PLEASED WITH A BIPARTISAN SUPPORT AS WE WORK TO. DECARBONISE ONE OF THE HARDEST TO DECARBONISE INDUSTRIES AND AS CALIFORNIA GOES HOW GOES SO GOES THE COUNTRY. AND I THINK THIS WILL HAVE GLOBAL IMPACTS THANK YOU VERY MUCH I RESPECTFULLY QUESTION I VOTE. THANK YOU- I DON'T HAVE A MOTION FOR THE AGENTS OR DID I HAVE I'M SORRY. HI OKAY MATHIS.

PLEASE GO AHEAD AND START WHEN YOU'RE READY THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I GOOD MORNING- MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS SAID TODAY IN PRESENTING SENATE BILL SEVENTY SIX WHICH MAKES THE CLEAN TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM MORE EQUITY FOCUSED I WILL COOK WILL CHOIR COLLABORATIVE INTERAGENCY PLANNING TO EFFICIENTLY PROMOTE CLEAN TRANSPORTATION FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. SB TWO SEVEN TWO SIX WITH VANCE EQUITY BY SPECIFYING THAT AT LEAST 50% OF FUTURE CLEAN TRANSPORTATION DOLLARS BENEFIT INDIVIDUALS. AND DISADVANTAGED AND LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES AND REQUIRING DIRECT INVESTMENTS IN THOSE COMMUNITIES AS WELL. SB SEVENTY SIX ALSO ADDS MARKET STABILITY BY PRIORITIZING MULTI YEAR PROJECTS FOR CLEAN TRANSPORTATION FUNDING- IT ALSO PLANS FOR THE FUTURE OF CLEAN TRANSPORTATION BY CREATING A SUSTAINABLE TRANSPORTATION STRATEGY WHICH WILL IDENTIFY AND DEVELOP STRATEGIES TO ACHIEVE EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS GOALS. IT WILL TAKE A BROAD LOOK AT OUR CLEAN TRANSPORTATION OPTIONS INCLUDING BMT REJECT REDUCTION TRANSIT AND ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION. TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT TODAY IS MEREDITH ALEXANDER REPRESENTING CAL START AND BILL MCGOVERN THE POLICY DIRECTOR FOR THE COALITION FOR CLEAN AIR THANK YOU THANK YOU- WHY DON'T WE START WITH MR MCGOVERN SINCE HE'S PRESENT IN THE HEARING ROOM AS OUR FIRST WITNESS PLEASE GO AHEAD. ALL IF THAT'S YOUR PLEASURE MADAM CHAIR OF A CAL STAR IS THE SPONSOR SO I DEFER TO THEM EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE ON THE PHONE. OKAY GO AHEAD. SIR WE WILL SPEND START WITH. MEREDITH ALEXANDER. FROM CAL START MODERATED MORNING OPEN UP THE LINE YES THANK. PLEASE GO AHEAD MORNING CHAIR RIVAS AND NUMBERS. CAN YOU HEAR ME YES PLEASE PLEASE GO AHEAD. OKAY GREAT. ALEXANDER HERE POLICY DIRECTOR FOR CAL START- WE ARE THE SPONSOR AND SB SEVEN TWENTY SIX AND WE WISH TO THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP AND ALSO OF COURSE THE AUTHOR AND COMMITTEE STAFF WHO HAVE WORKED HARD ON THE POLICY A PLOW CAL STARTED A MEMBER BASED NONPROFIT WITH OVER TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY MEMBER COMPANIES DEDICATED TO TRANSFORMING THE TRANSPORTATION INDUSTRY THAT INCLUDE VEHICLE MANUFACTURED ZERO EMISSION TECHNOLOGY PROVIDERS. PUBLIC AND PRIVATE FLEETS AND MORE AND THE ENERGY COMMISSION CLEAN TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM HAS REALLY BEEN A CRITICAL ELEMENT OF OUR STATE TRANSPORTATION CLIMATE PROGRAMS AND IT IS A TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL PROGRAM THAT HELPED TO ADVANCE ADVANCED VEHICLE AND KILLING TECHNOLOGIES HOWEVER THE STATE HAS PASSED MANY LANDMARK CLIMATE LICENSE TO PROGRAM A STRETCH OF FABLESS I'M A FIFTEEN YEARS AGO WITH A DOCTOR AND BUSINESSMAN DATES FOR VEHICLES AND THAT SET VERY. SPECIFIC EMISSIONS REDUCTION TARGET. SO TO REFLECT THE REALITIES IT REALLY MAKE SENSE TO MODIFY THE STATUE THAT GUY THE PROGRAM TO ENSURE THAT- REFLECT OUR GOAL. AS WELL AS TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS AND MARKET TRENDS THIS BILL DOES JUST THAT. FOR EXAMPLE WE KNOW WE NEED TO RAPIDLY SCALE UP INFRASTRUCTURE FOR MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY THEIR EMISSION VEHICLES PATROL BEGAN COMING TO MARKET REALLY QUICKLY DUE TO THE ADVANCE CLEAN. FOR ALL. BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE STILL MAINTAINS NINE ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE FUNDING AND IS. TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL. MORE RECENT AMENDMENTS TAKEN ON THE BILL ADDRESSED THENEED TO ENSURE EQUITABLE ACCESS TO CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE AND CLEAN TRANSPORTATION. BY ENSURING THAT HALF OF PROGRAM FUNDS WILL BENEFIT THESE COMMUNITIES THREE THINGS LIKE REPLACING POLLUTING DIESEL VEHICLES ARE FOCUSING ON CHARGING FOR APARTMENT DWELLERS AMONG OTHER THINGS. IT FOR THESE REASONS THAT WE ARE VERY HAPPY TO SPONSOR THE BILL WE'RE COMMITTED TO CONTINUING DISCUSSIONS WITH THE ASSEMBLY AND STAKEHOLDERS TO MAKE FURTHER ENHANCEMENTS TO IT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND WE RESPECTFULLY. RESPECTFULLY AFTER I THAT. NEXT WITNESS THANKS MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS BILL MCGAVIN WITH THE COAST FOR CLEAN AIR AND ALSO TESTIFYING ON BEHALF OF OUR PARTNERS IN THE CHARGE AHEAD CALIFORNIA CAMPAIGN. COMMUNITIES FOR A BETTER ENVIRONMENT FOR THE GREEN LINING INSTITUTE. ENVIRONMENT CALIFORNIA AND THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL- ALL IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS LEGISLATION. AND WE REALLY WANT TO THANK CENTER GONZALEZ AND ALSO CAL STAR FOR WORKING WITH US ON THE EQUITY GUARANTEES. THAT WOULD ASSURE. THAT THIS FUNDING WILL BENEFIT OUR DISADVANTAGED AND LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES BECAUSE- ALL CALIFORNIANS DESERVE TO HAVE QUEEN TRANSPORTATION. AND CLEAN AIR AND- THE CENTRE GONZALEZ IS BEEN A CHAMPION IN TRYING TO CLEAN UP THE AIR PARTICULAR FROM GOODS MOVEMENT. ALL WHICH IS THE BIGGEST SOURCE OF AIR POLLUTION IN CALIFORNIA. AND THIS BILL WOULD HELP TO GET THOSE REDUCTIONS IN BOTH AIR POLLUTION AND GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. COMING FROM THE MOVEMENT OF GOODS AND THE MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO- WE APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY AND STRONG SUPPORT THE BILL. THANK YOU. WE HAVE TWO WITNESSES REGISTERED IN OPPOSITION UP THERESA COOK FROM THE CALIFORNIA HYDROGEN COALITION. AND MARGOT PARKES FROM THE WESTERN STATES PETROLEUM ASSOCIATION MODERATOR CAN YOU PLEASE OPEN UP THE LINES FOR WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU BOTH LINES ARE OPEN. THANK YOU CARE GOOD MORNING EVERYONE TERESA COOK ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA HYDROGEN COALITION OUR MEMBERS CONSISTENT FUEL CELL ELECTRIC VEHICLE MANUFACTURERS HYDROGEN FUEL PRODUCERS AND HYDROGEN FUEL RETAILERS AND WE HAVE CURRENTLY AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION ONNINETY SEVEN TWENTY FACT. WE APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S INTENT BUT OUT THREATEN HYDROGEN FUELING CONTINUES TO BE OMITTED FROM THE NEW SECTION THREE WHICH DIRECTS THE EASY- SPENDING ON THE WHOLE THE CHANGES TO THAT PROGRAM WITHOUT CONSIDERATION FOR HOW HYDROGEN FUELING INFRASTRUCTURE WILL BE SUPPORTED RISKS OUR COLLECTIVE ABILITY TO ENSURE EVERY CALIFORNIAN HAD ACCESS TO ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE. AND WITH A GREATER FINANCIAL BURDEN ON THE STATE AND REPAIRS IF WE CONTINUE DOWN THE ROAD OF RELYING ON A SINGLE ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE TECHNOLOGY FOR THOSE REASONS WE CONTINUE TO OPPOSE THE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU- OPERATIONS CONCERT. I'M IN THE MOOD ALRIGHT THANK YOU. NEXT WITNESS PLEASE GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MORNING AND MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE HARD PARTS THAT THE WESTERN CAPE DISAPPOINTMENT EDUCATION AND ALSO GOING INTO THE GAME WITH NEW COLORS AND MARK MENDED TECHNICIAN ON ATHLETE SEVEN TWENTY SIX AND WE ONLY AGREE WITH THE AUTHOR- ON THE INTENT AND THE BELL THAT COMPREHENSIVE IN ALIPAY- THAT AND A TRANSPORTATION PLAN. IT'S CRITICAL NEED OUR STATE'S CLINICAL THIS IS- CERTAINLY WITHOUT WITHOUT ARGUMENT AND WHAT WE BELIEVE IS THE WAY THE BILL CURRENTLY DRAFTED DOESN'T QUITE ACHIEVE THAT OUTCOME- FIRST ORDERED IN IN THE BELUM CALLING FOR NEW TRANSPORTATION SECTOR EMISSIONS REDUCTION GOAL THERE IS- SIGNIFICANT OVERLAP BETWEEN AND NEW GOAL AND INVESTING REGULATIONS AS ABOUT THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM WHICH REQUIRES EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS FROM ALL SECTORS. AT LOCAL LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD WHICH- MANDATE IMPROVEMENT- AND REDUCTIONS OF CARBON INTENSITY THANK YOU ALL AND WE'RE CONCERNED THAT ADDING A NEW GOAL WILL ONLY POTENTIALLY FURTHER COMPLICATE THE STATE CARBON GOLD AS IT RELATES TRANSPORTATION AND HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO INCREASE CRAP WITHOUT REALLY DELIVERING ANY MEASURABLE BENEFITS AND I THINK THAT THAT HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED I'M IN THE AUDITOR'S RECENT REPORT WHERE THEY CALLED INTO QUESTION SOME OF THE BENEFITS BEING GENERATED. BY THE STATE'S TRANSPORTATION PROGRAMS OVERSEEN BY THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD WE WOULD CERTAINLY ENCOURAGE- THE ANALYSIS AND HOW KIND AND THAT- I DON'T REPORT TO BE CONSIDERED PRIOR Q. AND CHANGES IN POLICY THAT CAN RESULT IN CHANGES AND. EXPENDITURE FOR THAT PROGRAM. ADDITIONALLY IT'S CRAP. I THINK IT'S BY THE AND MEANING ALL MENT BY AUTHORED AIR QUALITY. ARE HONE- IMPRO GREEN OUR ERIC. AND ANY TO BE PART THE PLAN TO BUILD OKAY VERY HEAVILY ON PART. I THINK. YOU NOW THAT THAT AND I THAT WHILE IS CERTAINLY POWER BEING OF THE AUTHORS OCT AND THE- TO MAKE THIS TECHNO NEUTRAL BELT THAT THERE ARE CHANGE THAT NEED. TO ALLOW THEM EXISTING TECHNOLOGY TODAY TO HELP MAKE AIR QUALITY IMPROVEMENT AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO. CONTINUING TO WORK ON THOSE CHIU PROPONENTS OF THE BELT- AND THINK.

I HAVE NO FURTHER COMMENT THANK YOU AT THIS TIME I THINK YOU WILL OPEN IT UP TO QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS WE'LL START WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER MATHIS. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- CENTER MAYBE BUT MY QUESTION IS KIND OF LEAN TO WHY THERE ISN'T LANGUAGE THAT REALLY SHOWS YOU'RE YOU'RE ACTUALLY TRYING TO SET THIS UP FOR A DIVERSIFIED CLEAN ENERGY PORTFOLIO. BECAUSE WE IT WE'VE ALL SEEN THE IN IN A LOT OF US GOT GOING BACK TO THE DAYS WHERE WE ALL HASHED OUT CAP AND TRADE IN WE SET A LOT OF THESE GOALS WE MADE DECISIONS WITH THE INDUSTRY SAYING HEY THIS IS% THE GOAL THIS IS WHERE WE WANT YOU TO ACHIEVE. AND LET'S MOVE FORWARD AND WORK TO THAT SOCIAL NGUYEN THE LANGUAGE. START TALKING ABOUT WELL LET'S SET A NEW GOAL. IT'S QUESTIONS COME UP WHEN THE LANGUAGE IS A VERY SPECIFIC A. AS WE'VE HEARD FROM THE OPPOSITION. YOU KNOW WE HAVE HYDROGEN FUEL FUTURES WE'VE JUST SEEN VEHICLES BREAK LAND MILES TRAVELED. FOR HYDROGEN CARS. CHAU CLEARLY THAT'S A VIABLE OPTION THAT'S NOT BEING DISCUSSED ENOUGH FRANKLY BUT BY THIS BODY BY OUR GOVERNOR IN WE'RE NOT HEARING ENOUGH ABOUT IT EVEN THOUGH WE CLAIM TO LEAD THE WAY- WE DON'T HEAR ENOUGH ABOUT. RENEWAL RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS THAT THEY WERE GETTING FROM HARVESTING- METHANE FROM DERRY DIED GESTURES. IN WHAT THAT CAN DO FOR LOCAL AND MEDIUM FLEETS IN THAT SPACE AND HOW THAT CAN REMOVE A LOT OF THE GREENHOUSE GASES FROM R. OR MEDIUM SIZED IN AND LOCAL FLEAS. IN REMOVED THE DIESEL IN THAT PART. CHAU WELL WHEN I SEE LANGUAGE THAT THAT FINE TUNES SOMETHING IN THIS SPACE AND A LOT OF MY COLLEAGUES WE WE'VE ALL WORKED VERY HARD ON THIS SOME OF US HAVE GONE OUT OF OUR WAY- BERMAN OF ENERGY HAS A FANTASTIC SCHOOL FOR LEGISLATORS IT'S- THE LEGISLATIVE ENERGY HORIZON IS TO DO THE REALLY DIES OF THE NUTS AND BOLTS AND THE POLICY ON THIS- SADLY THERE'S ONLY TWO PEOPLE. IN THE HUNDRED TWENTY OF US THE THAT I'VE ACTUALLY GRADUATED FROM THAT SCHOOL THIS MYSELF A LOT OF BURKE. AND WE LEARN THE FIVE NIGHTS ON THIS IS WHY WE WORK SO HARD ON THE CAP AND TRADE BILL THAT'S WHY WE STILL PUSH. TO ENSURE THERE IS THIS DIVERSIFIED PORTFOLIO. EIGHT IN. MY QUESTION FOR YOU CENTERS WHY THAT ISN'T SPELLED OUT HOW COME YOU HAVEN'T SPELLED OUT. YOU SAY YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THIS IS THIS IS DIVERSIFIED THAT WE'RE GONNA INCLUDE HYDROGEN THAT WE'RE GOING TO INCLUDE OTHER. ZERO EMISSION FUELS. BUT IT'S NOT SPECIFIED IN YOUR BILL SO WHY IS THAT. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION ASSEMBLY MEMBER- AND JUST FOR THE RECORD I'M A PORT SENATOR SO I REPRESENT ONE OF THE LARGEST PORTS IN THE STATE OF CALIFONIA. BEEN REPRESENTING THEM FOR OVER A DECADE WELL AWARE OF THE TECHNOLOGY DIVERSITY THAT WE WANT TO KEEP AND THIS BILL BASICALLY STATES THAT IT IS TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL. THAT STRATEGY THAT- THE OPPOSITION WAS SAYING THAT IS TO THE FOCUSED. WE ACTUALLY INCLUDED. A LANGUAGE THAT INCLUDES NEAR ZERO TECHNOLOGY AS ONE OF THE STRATEGIES THAT SHOULD BE S. AS IN THE TRANSPORTATION STRATEGY THIS IS SUSTAINABLE TRANSPORTATION STRATEGY SO IT'S TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL. AND THEN WE ALSO INCLUDED AMENDMENTS IN SENATE Q. R. THAT INCLUDED A SPECIFIED THAT THEIR THEIR RECENT SPORT RESOURCES BOARD SHALL CONSIDER INCLUDING EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS GOALS THAT'S NOT A REQUIREMENT. WELL THAT IS OF THE DRESS THE OPPOSITION CENTER THAT THAT'S FANTASTIC WE DID THE POINT IS YOU STILL HAVE CLEAR OPPOSITION. FROM INDUSTRIES IN THE RENEWABLE SPACE. SO THAT TELLS US THAT THERE'S MORE WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE AND MORE AMENDMENTS THE NEED TO GET DONE ON THIS. AND BEING THAT YOU DO REPRESENT THE PARTS I'M SURE YOU'RE AWARE THAT THE PORTS ARE FRANKLY TERRIFIED THAT THEY'RE GONNA HAVE A BILLION DOLLARS COST. AND HAVING TO GO TO A LECTURE FOR CATION- NGUYEN. IF WE DO A BETTER JOB AT THE LANGUAGE WE'RE PUTTING INTO OUR LEGISLATION. WE CAN SHOW THEM THAT YOU KNOW YES YOU CAN DO SOME ELECTRIC HERE. YOU CAN DO SOME HYDROGEN FUEL STUFF HERE. IF YOU'RE IN ONE MORE IN. DO YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO THE RENEWABLE. NATURAL GAS SITE HERE. SO IT IS VERY IMPERATIVE. THAT WE GET THESE THINGS RIGHT. BECAUSE WHEN IT COMES TO THESE THE DETAILS MATTER. INSULA INTEL I SEE THAT FINE I'D LANGUAGE AND SEE THIS OPPOSITION- THE THAT ANOTHER RENEWABLE FUEL SOURCE THAT THE FRANKLY IS ACTUALLY MORE VIABLE- THEN GOING STRAIGHT ELECTRIC VEHICLE- THE INTEL I SEE THAT I'M GONNA STAY OFF YOUR BILL. IN IN IF YOU'D LIKE SOME HELP PUTTING THAT TOGETHER A MORE THAN HELP HAPPY TO SIT DOWN AND TAKE PERSONAL TIME TO WORK WITH YOU ON THAT- BECAUSE I THINK WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO HERE IS IMPORTANT. BUT IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE GET IT CORRECT. YEAH AND WE ARE WORKING TOWARDS THAT SO THIS IS AGAIN VERY TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL AND I WOULD JUST. RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE WITH YOU KNOW SOME OF YOUR COMMENTS BUT- WELL TAKEN THANK YOU. HE NEXT ASSEMBLY MEMBER MURATSUCHI. THANK YOU CENTER I- COMPLETELY- SUPPORT- THE V. FOR ALL GOAL OF YOUR BELL- BUT I DID HAVE SOME QUESTIONS AS SIMILAR TO A MISTER MATHIS I REMEMBER. WHEN I WAS INVITED VIçT TO THE PORT OF LONG BEACH- WHERE- TOYOTA AND MARY NICHOLS ROLLED OUT- MODEL- HYDROGEN FUEL CELL HEAVY DUTY TRUCKS AS PART OF THE SOLUTION TO REALLY CLEAN UP THE AIR QUALITY AND- NO IN IN SOME OF THE HARDER NO THE MOST IMPACTED TO. MOST PUT- POLLUTED COMMUNITIES- IN IN YOUR DISTRICT- AND SO I WAS JUST I DON'T KNOW THE DETAILS A I DON'T REALLY. UNDERSTAND WHY THE- CALIFORNIA HYDROGEN COALITION IS IN OPPOSITION BUT I WOULD THINK THAT- THAT HYDROGEN THANK YOU HAVE A GREAT DAY FOR THE QUESTION AND I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND- YOU KNOW EVERYONE'S- I GUESS. QUESTIONS ABOUT WHY IT'S NOT EXPLICITLY pTECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO SAY IF THERE ARE OTHER TECHNOLOGIES ASIDE FROM JUST ELECTRIC THAT WE CAN DO SOMETHING IN THE AND IN THE INTERMEDIATE FOR WE ARE LOOKING AT HYDROGEN FUEL CELL RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS WITH HAPPY. THIS IS OPEN TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT OKAY- WE ACTUALLY HAVE HYDROGEN USERS THAT ARE IN OUR SUPPORT SUPPORT COALITION AS WELL SO YOU KNOW WE'RE LOOKING AT EVERYTHING HAVING DIESEL RIGHT NOW ON THIS ON THE ROADS IT'S JUST NOT ACCEPTABLE AND SO I THINK- TO MR GAVIN'S POINT AND TO- IS ALEXANDER'S POINT YOU KNOW WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT WERE OPEN- BUT WE NEED TO START MAKING THESE CHANGES. RIGHT AWAY SO CAN'T. YOU KNOW WICKS OF. IRAQ HELLO THANK YOU I LOOK FOR TO- THAT CLARIFICATION. ANOTHER POINT THAT WAS. RAISED IN THE- COMMITTEE ANALYSIS SO. YOU KNOW. UNDER THE HEADING OF THE QUESTION MARK ERROR DISTRICTS GIVEN SHORT SHRIFT IN THE STRATEGY. THAT YOU KNOW- MAKING THE POINT THAT THE OUR LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS LIKE THE SOUTH COAST AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT. YOU KNOW WE WHICH IS MUCH MORE- PLAYS A MUCH MORE SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN THE CAR MORE IT MORE YOUR ANOTHER- CLEAN VEHICLE PROGRAMS- IT IS THE IS THE INTENTTO GIVE IT TO. LESS OF A- OF A ROLE AS A CONSUL CONSULTATION ROLE RATHER THAN A COORDINATION ROLE. THAT WASN'T THE INTENT AT ALL AND SO I'M GLAD THAT THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS POINTED THAT OUT WE'RE HAPPY WE'VE BEEN ENGAGING WITH THEM AS WELL. AND SO WOULD LOVE TO YOU KNOW CONTINUE ENGAGING THEM AND ENSURE THAT THEY ARE PART OF THE PROCESS BECAUSE IT WAS A GOOD CALL OUT SO WE APPRECIATE THAT ARAFAT. WAS DEFINITELY BUT IF MR MCCABE AND I KNOW THAT HE'S HERE IF YOU'D LIKE TO ADD ANYTHING ELSE AS WELL. I KNOW HE'S BEEN OUR PARTNER- IN THIS AS WELL. WELL THANK YOU I WOULD JUST SAY- YOUR REITERATED THE CENTRE'S POINT THAT THE LANGUAGE IN THE BILL IS TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL. THERE'S NOTHING IN THERE THAT SAYS IT'S GOING TO BE ALL BATTERY ELECTRIC THAT DOESN'T APPEAR IN THE BILL. IT INCLUDES HYDROGEN HYDROGEN VEHICLES ARE ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES SO I YOU KNOW WE WOULDN'T SUPPORT IT OTHERWISE. SO IT IT'S OPEN TO THOSE TECHNOLOGIES THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA YEAH I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR. WORKING IN THIS SPACE WE SURE THAT CORRIDOR- AND- HEAVY POLLUTION ISSUES WITH ALL OF THE SO THAT WE HAVE OUT THERE SO THANK YOU FOR. DOING THIS WORK. MY QUESTION IS- ALL ALSO BASED ON THE ANALYSIS- SOME OF THE COMMENTS IN INDIA ANALYSIS AS WE'RE LOOKING AT. I HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN TO GET TO OUR GOAL TO KEEP OUR COMMUNITIES HEALTHIER. I GUESS THE QUESTION ABOUT VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED AND GETTING PEOPLE OUT OF THEIR CARS AND RIGHT NOW THAT'S NOT. THIS IS TO JUST FOCUS ON SAD'S- AND NOT ANY OF THAT THE OTHER PART OF THE STRATEGY SO JUST. WANTED TO YOUR COMMENT ON THAT ARE YOU LOOKING TO EXPAND AS THAT PART OF THE DISCUSSIONS OR- IS THAT A SEPARATE DISCUSSION IT'S ONE OF YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT. THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION I THINK IS ACTUALLY PART OF THE DISCUSSION AS WELL BECAUSE IT HISTORICALLY HASN'T BEEN CERVANTES ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION METHODS. IN ADDITION TO ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE MEDIUM HEAVY DUTY SPACE ENSURING THAT WE'RE GETTING OFF OF DIESEL TO ANOTHER TECHNOLOGY THAT WILL REDUCE EMISSIONS AND AIR POLLUTION SO. IT'S ALL PART OF THE- OF THE STRATEGY. WAS DEFINITELY. AND SO IS THAT IN THAT. LANGUAGE AT THAT'S ALL PART OF THE STRATEGY OR WE JUST ASSUMING THE- AGENCIES. ARE LOOKING UP WE'VE CALLED THAT OUT IN THIS AND THIS BILL TO BE A PART OF IT NOW THANK YOU. I BELIEVE WE DON'T HAVE ANY MORE QUESTIONS I WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE YEAH I WOULD SAY THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE QUESTIONS WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH MEMBER WOULD LIKE TO WORK WITH US I MEAN THE BOTTOM LINE IS. AGAIN I'VE GOT SOME OF THE WORST AIR POLLUTION AND- SOUTHEAST LOS ANGELES AND LONG BEACH. AND BEING A PART SENATOR THIS IS A VERY VERY IMPORTANT NOT JUST TO MY REGION BUT TO THE WHOLE STATE. SO WITH THAT RESPECT THE ASTRONOMICAL THANK YOU. THANK YOU- ACTUALLY WE DON'T HAVE A MOTION ON. KATE OF THE BILLS MOVE BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY SECONDED BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER GARCIA THE MOTION IS.

THIS PROGRAM WILL BE AS ACCESSIBLE TO AS MANY PRODUCERS AS POSSIBLE AND WILL NOT BE USED FOR INITIAL TALKS AT. THE PROJECT SHOULD RESULT IN REAL PERMANENT AND VERIFIABLE GREENHOUSE GAS REMOVAL. THERE ARE ALSO NEW TECHNOLOGIES EMERGING FOR DIRECTLY CAPTURING CARBON FROM THE ATMOSPHERE. WE SUPPORT SMALL SCALE TESTING THESE TECHNOLOGIES SO LONG AS THEY DO NOT NEGATIVELY IMPACT. NEIGHBORING COMMUNITIES AND THE ENVIRONMENT DO NOT IMPACT EXISTING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION REDUCTION EFFORTS.

THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR CENTER THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK ON THIS- I'VE SEEN FIRSTHAND IN IN MY DISTRICT THAT THE FIRES THAT I VISITED WHERE. YOU CAN PHYSICALLY SEE WHERE A FIRE IS JUST BROKE OFF A DRAWING EXTREMELY HIGH HEAT AND HIGH SPEED. AND THE BILL LITERALLY SEE A HOUSE THAT MEETS THESE REQUIREMENTS IT IS STILL STANDING IT'S LIKE WITHOUT A SCRATCH. RIGHT BY SAY THE- YEAH IT'S YOU KNOW THE- IN THE GARAGE THAT'S NOT ATTACHED WAS IT IN THE GARAGE IS MELTED TO THE GROUND. WHICH IS THE FRAME OF THE CAR LEFT THE BUT THE HOUSE IS IMMACULATE IT IS BECAUSE OF THE STANDARDS- THEY DO HAVE ONE QUESTION A I WOULD LIKE FOR YOU TO ADDRESS AND THAT IS THE CONCERNS OVER- YOU KNOW KINDA. ROBBING PETER TO PAY PAUL YOU KNOW IT'S A ARE WE PULLING AWAY FROM. THE PLANE THE DEAD TREES OUT IN ADDRESSING THE BARK BEETLE CRISIS AND EVERYTHING ELSE TO PAY FOR THIS THAT'S A CONCERN THAT'S BEEN OUT THERE AND I'D LOVE FOR YOU TO ADDRESS THAT- I. MIGHT MY PHILOSOPHY ON THIS IS WE SHOULD. PAY PAUL AND PETER AND- MANY OTHER PICTURE APOSTLE- THAT- THAT THERE SHOULDN'T BE INVESTMENT ALREADY WERE UNDER DOING IT MAY FEEL LIKE WE'RE THROWING EVERYTHING WE GOT IT WHILE FIRE BUT IN FACT THE RISKY TO CLIMBING IN A RECENT STUDY SAID AT LEAST THREE BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR SHOULD BE PUT INTO PREVENTION FROM STANFORD- AND RIGHT NOW WE'RE TO BILLION WHICH IS A LOT TO MARSHALL IS A LEGISLATURE BUT I DON'T INTENDED TO HAVE THIS BE DIVERSION THIS IS ABOUT ADDING FLEXIBILITY. AROUND THE FIRE PREVENTION- PROGRAM ESPECIALLY WITH CAL FIRE IN THEIR LOCAL ASSISTANCE GRANTS TO MAKE SURE THEY CAN DO. FIND WAYS TO GET INTO HARD TO REACH TERRITORIES IN PARTS ORANGE COUNTY L. A. COUNTY VENTURA COUNTY A LOT OF COMMITTEES HAVE BEEN TAKING ON THESE GRANTS BECAUSE- THEY ONLY SEE IT IS FUEL TREATMENT OR ITS CLEARANCE. SO WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO SORT OF DISENTANGLE THOSE POLITICS AND NOT MAKE PEOPLE FEARFUL OF STATE FUNDING IN THIS PLACE THAT IT'S JUST GONNA BE ABOUT. CLEARING TREES IN AREAS THAT HAVE SAY OAK WOODLANDS AND NEED THOSE TREES TO ACTUALLY BLOCK FIRES RIGHT SO. EXPANDING TO INCLUDE THINGS LIKE ROAD SIDE TREATMENT- TAKE REDEFINING CLEARANCE TO SOMETHING THAT IS MORE ABOUT INVASIVE SPECIES. I THINK IT'LL IT'LL HELP BUT I NO NO INTENT FOR DIVERSION JUST- JUST KIND OF. GET IN ESPECIALLY IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND THE CHAPARRAL ANY SORT OF ECOLOGICALLY SENSITIVE AREAS TO. TO BE PART OF IT TOO. SO PROCEDURE CONNAUGHT'S. SHARE YOUR ANSWER AND WOULD LIKE TO BE ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR- THANK YOU SIR. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER WHAT. THANK YOU SENATOR- IT'S A GREAT BEING ABLE TO PARTNER WITH YOU ON A LOT OF FIRE RELATED- AND PREVENTION RELATED- EFFORTS- THERE'S A LOT IN YOUR BILL THAT YOU DIDN'T TALK ABOUT. AND I KNOW THAT TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE BUT I WANT TO I WANT TO COMMEND YOU ON WHAT YOU HAVE INCLUDED IN THERE. I JUST HIGHLIGHT A COUPLE OF THOSE THINGS FOR THE FOR THE MEMBERS HERE. I GUESS REALLY APPROPRIATE FOR CAL FIRE I TO DEVELOP AN UPDATE SOME GUIDANCE AROUND- YOU KNOW THAT WHAT'S- APPROPRIATE REGIONAL- FUEL MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES. WHERE YOU LIVE IS QUITE DIFFERENT FROM WHERE I LIVE AND- THE LANDSCAPE IS DIFFERENT AND THE NEEDS ARE DIFFERENT. AND THE FACT THAT WE SEEM TO BE FOCUSING MORE ON THE NEEDS OF THE FOREST AND THINGS THAT I REPRESENT AND LESS ON THE CHAPARRAL AND SOME OF THE STATE THE LANDSCAPE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. I THINK NEEDS TO BE RECTIFIED- AND ALSO- ALSO APPRECIATE YOUR CALL OUT TO THE THAT CALIFORNIA'S BE. SHOULD GIVE US SOME REPORTS ON ON THE IMPACTS OF THE SB NINE ONE PROJECTS THAT THAT HAPPENED- THAT WAS A BILLION DOLLARS A BILLION DOLLARS OF INVESTMENT THERE AND- THAT THAT AND WE NEED TO KNOW DO.

TOO WOULD LIKE TO BE ADDED AS COOPER. THANK YOU. SOME MEMBER MERCY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH INTEREST AND I ALSO WOULD LIKE TO BE ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR TO YOU'RE IMPORTANT BILL HERE- BUT I BUT I DO HAVE CONCERNS LIKE I THINK A- YOU AND I. MAKE SURE THESE CONCERNS BUT- THE AND THE ONGOING DRUG. PUSH THROUGH THE REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT- REQUIREMENTS OF FOR HOUSING TO BE BUILT AND VERY HIGH FIRE. HAZARD SEVERITY ZONES- IT'S IT IS CONCERNING AND- I KNOW THAT THAT IS AS A WHOLE A SEPARATE SUBJECT BUT IT IS RELATED TO YOU TO THIS BILL AND THAT THE YOU KNOW THIS THIS COULD BE SEEN IN THIS COULD BE. USED AS A- AS A AS AN EXCUSE TO CONTINUE TO BUILD MORE AND VERY HIGH FIRE HAZARD. ZONES I WANTED TO. SEE IF YOU CAN SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT. I APPRECIATE THAT THAT- CAUTIOUSNESS AND- I WOULD NOT CERTAINLY WANT TO BE. PAVING THE WAY FOR MORE RISKY DEVELOPMENT IN THE STATE I. I KEEP TRYING TO WRESTLE WITH- WHAT DO YOU DO WITH THE PEOPLE WHO ALREADY LIVE THERE. RIGHT PEOPLE WHO LIVE WHERE I WOULDN'T SILMAR DEEP INTO PAYING- IN THE SAN GABRIEL MOUNTAINS OR IN THE NORTH COAST HER BRAIN OR WHATEVER IT IS AND- I THINK WE GOT A HARD NOSE COMMUNITIES. I THINK WE'VE GOT A- SORT OF SURGICALLY DEAL WITH EACH OTHER SYSTEMS BUT- WHAT I DON'T SEE HERE IS THAT BY EXPANDING THE BUILDING STANDARDS TO SAY HI FIRE ZONES. THAT THAT SHOULD THEN BE- SOME INFORMATICA. GO IN AND HAVE BREAKNECK BLIND GROWTH I THINK WE SHOULD BE FOCUSING ON INFILL AND- AND- AREAS WITHOUT. RISK SO- I APPRECIATE THE CAUTIOUSNESS AND- HOPEFULLY YOU'LL BE. MAKING SOME PROGRESS ON THAT THIS YEAR- MY BUILDING MAKE IT OUT OF OUR HOUSE BUT YOU HAVE ANOTHER ONE COMING YOUR WAY.
