00:23:42.554 --> 00:23:44.022
MIGHT HAVE SOME PROBLEMS HERE

00:23:44.089 --> 00:23:45.590

00:23:45.657 --> 00:23:48.960
GOVERNOR'S AUTHORITY. ALL THE

00:23:49.027 --> 00:23:50.061

RELUCTANT TO USURP LEGISLATIVE

00:23:52.664 --> 00:23:56.501

00:24:09.815 --> 00:24:12.250
THIS AGENCY IS RECORDED ALMOST

00:24:12.317 --> 00:24:14.786
A BLANK CHECK IN THE BUDGET. I

00:24:14.853 --> 00:24:21.326

FORWARD I WANTED TO ASK I AM

00:24:38.310 --> 00:24:39.544
ACTUALLY HAVE A QUESTION FOR

00:24:39.611 --> 00:24:41.847
THE AUTHOR- ABOUT SORT OF THE

00:24:41.913 --> 00:24:43.081
COORDINATED INTEGRATED

00:24:43.148 --> 00:24:45.951
APPROACH- THAT THIS OFFICE

00:24:46.017 --> 00:24:47.519
WOULD HAVE I THINK OFTEN TIMES

00:24:47.586 --> 00:24:49.054
WHEN WE'RE THINKING ABOUT AND

00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:51.556
TALKING ABOUT RACIAL EQUITY-

00:24:51.623 --> 00:24:52.657
WE'RE THINKING ABOUT THE TOP

00:24:52.724 --> 00:24:54.726
LINE ISSUES CRIMINAL JUSTICE

00:24:54.793 --> 00:24:57.429
HEALTH CARE RACIAL VIOLENCE BUT

00:24:57.495 --> 00:25:01.666
WE'VE NOTICED AND WE KNOW THAT-

00:25:01.733 --> 00:25:02.968
THEIR RACIAL INEQUITIES THAT

00:25:03.034 --> 00:25:03.869
HAPPENED IN EDUCATION AND

00:25:03.935 --> 00:25:05.270
TRANSPORTATION AND NOW

00:25:05.337 --> 00:25:06.771
INFRASTRUCTURE DOLLARS ARE

00:25:06.838 --> 00:25:09.040
GIVEN OUT. IN A DEVELOPMENT

00:25:09.107 --> 00:25:11.309
CONSTRUCTION HOUSING X. SENTARA

00:25:11.376 --> 00:25:16.248
AND- IT WOULD BE. I THINK THE

00:25:16.314 --> 00:25:18.116
STATE WOULD BE REMISS TO HAVE

00:25:18.183 --> 00:25:20.352
AN OFFICE A NEWLY CREATED

00:25:20.418 --> 00:25:23.154
OFFICE THAT OPERATES IN A SILO-

00:25:23.221 --> 00:25:25.056
AND THAT ISN'T LOOKING TO SORT

00:25:25.123 --> 00:25:27.792
OF INTEGRATE IN INFUSE- EITHER

00:25:27.859 --> 00:25:31.663
THESE KINDS OF- METRICS OR

00:25:31.730 --> 00:25:34.566
QUESTIONS OR BENCHMARKS THAT WE

00:25:34.633 --> 00:25:35.934
SHOULD REALLY BE APPLYING

00:25:36.001 --> 00:25:37.702
ACROSS THE BOARD IN ALL OF THE

00:25:37.769 --> 00:25:38.703
AGENCIES THAT ARE RUN BY THE

00:25:38.770 --> 00:25:40.872
STATE. SO I WAS WONDERING IF

00:25:40.939 --> 00:25:42.374
YOU COULD TALK A LITTLE BIT

00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:43.608
ABOUT THAT AND THEN GIVEN THE

00:25:43.675 --> 00:25:45.010
FACT THAT THERE WILL BE A

00:25:45.076 --> 00:25:46.578
SUNSET WITH SEVEN YEARS AND I

00:25:46.645 --> 00:25:47.479
CERTAINLY DON'T THINK THAT

00:25:47.545 --> 00:25:48.680
WE'RE GOING TO CURE AND THE

00:25:48.747 --> 00:25:49.881
CHALLENGES WITH OF RACIAL

00:25:49.948 --> 00:25:52.450
INEQUITY IN SEVEN YEARS. WHAT

00:25:52.517 --> 00:25:54.786
WOULD BE THE PLAN TO SORT OF-

00:25:54.853 --> 00:25:57.222
INTEGRATE YOU KNOW SO THAT IF

00:25:57.289 --> 00:25:58.623
IT DOES DISSOLVE THERE ARE

00:25:58.690 --> 00:26:00.325
STILL THE ELEMENTS OF THE

00:26:00.392 --> 00:26:03.128
OFFICE THAT ARE PERMEATING- YOU

00:26:03.194 --> 00:26:04.062
KNOW ACROSS ALL OF THE

00:26:04.129 --> 00:26:05.897
DEPARTMENTS. OF COURSE THERE IS

00:26:05.964 --> 00:26:07.232
AN OPPORTUNITY I'M SURE EXTEND

00:26:07.299 --> 00:26:09.267
THE SUNSET BUT IF THAT WERE NOT

00:26:09.334 --> 00:26:10.268
TO HAPPEN HOW WOULD WE MAKE

00:26:10.335 --> 00:26:11.536
SURE THAT WE'RE STILL ABLE TO

00:26:11.603 --> 00:26:14.172

WORK THAT WILL BE HAPPENING IN

00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:17.642
THIS OFFICE. I THINK YOU-

00:26:17.709 --> 00:26:19.411
CENTER CALLING FOR- FOR THE

00:26:19.477 --> 00:26:21.980
QUESTION- FIRST OF ALL- I THINK

00:26:22.047 --> 00:26:23.682
THE INTENT OF THE SUNSETS AS

00:26:23.748 --> 00:26:24.950
WORKING AS A IF I HAD A

00:26:25.016 --> 00:26:26.284
CONVERSATION WITH A CHAIR IS

00:26:26.351 --> 00:26:28.420
REALLY TO FOR- AND OPTING FOR

00:26:28.486 --> 00:26:30.488
REVIEW- TO EXAMINE THE

EFFECTIVENESS OF THE OFFICE SEE

00:26:32.090 --> 00:26:33.224
THERE'S ADJUSTMENTS WE NEED TO

00:26:33.291 --> 00:26:34.926
MAKE. TO THE LEGISLATION

00:26:34.993 --> 00:26:36.795
SOUNDING THIS OFFICE IN TERMS

00:26:36.861 --> 00:26:38.630
OF INSPECTORS MOVING FORWARD SO

00:26:38.697 --> 00:26:39.698
AT LEAST I CERTAINLY HOPE

00:26:39.764 --> 00:26:41.633
PERSONALLY THAT- THE PURPOSE OF

00:26:41.700 --> 00:26:43.568
THE SUNSET IS NOT TO TERMINATE

00:26:43.635 --> 00:26:45.203
THE OFFICE AT THAT TIME BUT TO

00:26:45.270 --> 00:26:47.038
IMPROVE IT AND AT NOW THAT WE

00:26:47.105 --> 00:26:49.107
HAD. THAT TIME LESSONS I DO

00:26:49.174 --> 00:26:50.275
APPRECIATE THE CHAIR WORKING

00:26:50.342 --> 00:26:52.143

00:26:52.210 --> 00:26:53.845
SUNSET TO GET SUFFICIENT TIME

00:26:53.912 --> 00:26:56.915
FOR THIS OFFICE TO. BE ABLE TO-

00:26:56.982 --> 00:26:58.249
LUNCH IT'S INITIAL WORK

00:26:58.316 --> 00:27:00.118
SUPPORTERS OPPORTUNITIES ENOUGH

00:27:00.185 --> 00:27:01.753
SO THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR A

00:27:01.820 --> 00:27:03.655
GOOD VALUE AND GOOD EVALUATION

00:27:03.722 --> 00:27:04.889
BUT YOU'RE YOU'RE NOT GONNA

00:27:04.956 --> 00:27:05.991
SOLVE SYSTEMIC RACISM IN SEVEN

00:27:06.057 --> 00:27:11.196
YEARS- AND NOT ALL. DEAL PART

00:27:11.262 --> 00:27:13.531
IS YOU MEANT IS THAT- TO A OF

00:27:13.598 --> 00:27:14.966
EXAMPLE DO AN OFF OF. EQUITY

00:27:15.033 --> 00:27:17.802
AND THE HEALTH HUMAN. AND

00:27:17.869 --> 00:27:19.738
HEALTH EQUITY BUT AGAIN THE

00:27:19.804 --> 00:27:21.906
SILO IN ISSUE IS VERY IMPORTANT

00:27:21.973 --> 00:27:23.475
SO FOR EXAMPLE WE CAN THINK

00:27:23.541 --> 00:27:25.510
ABOUT CERTAIN HOUSING POLICIES

00:27:25.577 --> 00:27:28.279
THEN UNDERMINING- ACTUALLY

00:27:28.346 --> 00:27:30.782
WEALTH'S. CONTINUATION BY THAT

00:27:30.849 --> 00:27:33.551
BY- ACTUALLY BLACK AMERICANS

00:27:33.618 --> 00:27:35.787
AND OTHER. ANGEL GROUPS AS WELL

00:27:35.854 --> 00:27:38.623
THEN WHICH THEN HAS.

00:27:38.690 --> 00:27:41.026
CONSEQUENCES FOR. NOT ONLY

00:27:41.092 --> 00:27:42.627

SO THESE. POLICIES IN ONE SILO

00:27:50.468 --> 00:27:51.569
CAN HAVE TREMENDOUS IMPACTS IN

00:27:51.636 --> 00:27:53.538
OTHERS AND I THINK THIS IS

00:27:53.605 --> 00:27:54.806
SOMETHING IS BEEN RECOGNIZED BY

00:27:54.873 --> 00:27:57.275

THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH'S

00:32:02.954 --> 00:32:04.922
POSSIBLY EVEN. THE ENTIRE

00:32:04.989 --> 00:32:07.759
BREADTH OF. DIVISIONS OF THE

00:32:10.628 --> 00:32:11.329
SEVEN MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS

WHICH OF COURSE WOULD GO TO THE

00:32:12.797 --> 00:32:13.498
ABOUT THE GOVERNOR AND THE

POLICY WITHIN THE DIVISIONS OF

THE STATE OR COULD THEY BE

00:32:28.313 --> 00:32:30.114
DIRECTED IT SEPARATELY TO

PASS THE LEGISLATURE. WELL I

00:32:35.153 --> 00:32:36.421
THINK THAT ANY REGULATORY BODY

00:32:36.487 --> 00:32:37.322
HAS TO WORK WITHIN THE

00:32:37.388 --> 00:32:39.657
CONSTRAINTS OF THE- THE CODE

00:32:39.724 --> 00:32:41.426
WHICH WE OF COURSE PASSES THE

00:32:41.492 --> 00:32:44.462
LEGISLATURE AND SO- IN MY EIGHT

00:32:44.529 --> 00:32:45.363
TIMES BODIES TO MAKE

00:32:45.430 --> 00:32:46.331
RECOMMENDATIONS AND THEN

00:32:46.397 --> 00:32:48.366
BETWEEN IT AND THE DIALOGUE

00:32:48.433 --> 00:32:50.001
BETWEEN NOT EXECUTIVE AND THE

00:32:50.068 --> 00:32:52.503
LEGISLATIVE- WE HAD A

00:32:52.570 --> 00:32:53.971
DISCUSSION ABOUT HOW WHAT WOULD

WE DO WITH THE WITH THAT

00:32:55.406 --> 00:32:57.709
PARTICULAR RECOMMENDATION AND-

00:32:57.775 --> 00:32:59.310
OFTENTIMES WE WILL ACT AS THE

00:32:59.377 --> 00:33:01.512
LEGISLATURE TO. EITHER PUSH THE

00:33:01.579 --> 00:33:02.880
ADMINISTRATION TO DO SOMETHING

00:33:02.947 --> 00:33:04.549
OR EVEN LIMITED MINISTRATION

00:33:04.615 --> 00:33:05.149
FROM DOING SOMETHING WE DON'T

00:33:05.216 --> 00:33:08.953
AGREE WITH SO I THINK THAT'S

00:33:09.020 --> 00:33:09.487
PART OF THE NORMAL POLICY

00:33:09.554 --> 00:33:10.121

WELL AS ALL THREE BRANCHES OF

00:33:24.268 --> 00:33:26.437
OUR GOVERNMENT. THAT THERE BE A

00:33:26.504 --> 00:33:28.506
FORMAL SYSTEM IN IT THIS WOULD

00:33:28.573 --> 00:33:30.842
ALL THIS BE LIKE A FRIENDLY I

00:33:30.908 --> 00:33:33.244
REQUEST FOR AMENDMENT. THAT AS

00:33:33.311 --> 00:33:35.446
THIS MOVES FORWARD TO

00:33:35.513 --> 00:33:38.516
APPROPRIATIONS. THAT IT BE

00:33:38.583 --> 00:33:39.717

00:33:39.784 --> 00:33:42.387
RECOMMENDATIONS TAKE A

00:33:42.453 --> 00:33:44.922
FORMALITY MEANING THAT IN ONE

00:33:44.989 --> 00:33:47.325

ANY RECOMMENDATIONS BE

00:33:51.329 --> 00:33:53.264
CONSOLIDATED SO WE THEY CAN BE

00:33:53.331 --> 00:33:54.499
KEPT TRACK OF BECAUSE MY

00:33:54.565 --> 00:33:56.434
CONCERN IS THAT A COMMISSION

00:33:56.501 --> 00:33:58.269
LIKE THIS IS GOING TO SIPHON

00:33:58.336 --> 00:34:01.339

00:34:01.406 --> 00:34:03.040
OVER SEVEN YEAR PERIOD OF TIME

00:34:03.107 --> 00:34:05.543
AND WE'RE THE PUBLIC AND OTHER

00:34:05.610 --> 00:34:07.512
MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE ARE

00:34:07.578 --> 00:34:08.813
NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO KEEP

00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:10.681
TRACK OF EXACTLY WHAT THIS IS

00:34:10.748 --> 00:34:12.216
BEING- HOW THIS IS BEING

00:34:12.283 --> 00:34:13.384
CONDUCTED IN A WAY THAT IS

00:34:13.451 --> 00:34:17.121
HOLISTIC AND COMPREHENSIVE. SO

00:34:17.188 --> 00:34:18.322
I'LL LEAVE THAT UP TO YOU IF

00:34:18.389 --> 00:34:20.158
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT YOU

CERTAIN CERTAINLY THE

00:34:22.927 --> 00:34:24.762
GOVERNMENT COMMISSIONED- ISSUED

00:34:24.829 --> 00:34:26.097
ITS RECOMMENDATION SHOULD BE A

00:34:26.164 --> 00:34:27.698
MATTER OF PUBLIC RECORD AND-

00:34:27.765 --> 00:34:29.000
STUDENTS HAVE TO BE ORGANIZED

00:34:29.067 --> 00:34:30.101
IN A WAY THAT COULD BE EASILY

00:34:30.168 --> 00:34:32.703
REFERENCED BY OTHERS- THOUGH

00:34:32.770 --> 00:34:34.138

DIALOGUE WITH YOU- THAT THAT

00:34:45.583 --> 00:34:47.585
BUT I WOULD IMAGINE ANY PUBLIC

COMMISSION PUTTING THIS ONE

00:34:48.553 --> 00:34:49.020

HAVE. HAS THE INSTRUMENTS THAT

00:35:23.387 --> 00:35:24.922

NEW COMMISSION- BECAUSE THIS IS

00:35:33.831 --> 00:35:36.968
