AND MEMBERS AND SANDERS -- AB FOR A TEAM WITH EXTENDING EVIDENTIARY PRIVILEGED COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN EMPLOYEE AND THE UNION REPRESENTATIVE. ALTHOUGH IT IS UNFORTUNATE MANY WORKS TODAY PACE ISSUES DISCRIMINATION EXPLOITATION HARASSMENT AND RETALIATION. EMPLOYEES ASSUME THAT SUCH COMMUNITY OF OFTENTIMES ASSUME THAT SUCH COMMUNICATION DISCUSS BUT THEIR OFFICIAL UNION REPRESENTATIVE IS CONFIDENTIAL THAT INFORMATION MAY NOT BE DISCLOSED THE EMPLOYER OTHER THIRD PARTIES. HOWEVER NO STATE STATUTE PROVIDES US COMMUNICATIONS WITH AN EVIDENTIARY PRIVILEGE NOTICE CASE I RECOGNIZE SUCH A PRIVILEGE. DOES EXTENZE INCIDENCES OF SEXUAL ASSAULT HARASSMENT AND DISCRIMINATION WHERE AN EMPLOYEE PREFERS TO APPROACH HIS OR HER YEAR REPRESENTATIVE. RATHER THAN THE HUMAN RESOURCES DEPARTMENT. PRISONERS ARE AN IMPORTANT THIRD PARTY WHEN THERE'S REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THE EMPLOYER DOES NOT HAVE THE BEST INTERESTS. OF THE EMPLOYEE IN MIND. DURING A TIME OF THE ME TOO MOVEMENT AS EMPOWER WOMEN AND OTHERS REPORT AND SPEAK OUT ABOUT HARASSMENT THE WORKPLACE ADDITIONAL CONFIDENTIAL HAVANESE REPORT THESE INCIDENCES ARE IN GREATER NEED. ADDITIONALLY AS YOU SEEN WORKER PROTECTIONS IN JEOPARDY DO THE FEDERAL POLICIES IN COURT RULINGS YOU MUST DO MORE AS A STATE TO PROTECT CALIFORNIA WORKERS. BY ALLOWING EVIDENTIARY PRIVILEGE TO WORKERS AND UNION REPRESENTATIVES WE CAN HELP TO ENSURE THE SAFE PRIVATE AND FULL DISCLOSURE OF BURKE PURRS WORKPLACE CONCERNS AND NEEDS. BUT BEING IN SUPPORT OUR STEVEN WEBER LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS RECORD ASKED ME AND JASON CON WELL REPRESENT REPRESENTATION SPECIALIST THE CALIFORNIA FACULTY ASSOCIATION. THANK YOU TO WITNESSES WHOEVER WANTS TO GO FIRST TWO MINUTES PLEASE WE DO KEEP TIME SO TRY TO KEEP AS CLOSE AS YOU CAN-[inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU A GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR JACKSON AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS JASON COMMA I'M A REPRESENTATIONS. CALIFORNIA FACULTY ASSOCIATION CFA IS A SPONSOR OF A CO SPONSOR OF THIS BILL. IN MY POSITION I RIVER REPRESENT FACULTY MEMBERS AND EMPLOYMENT IS BE TO THEIR EMPLOYER. AND WHEN I DISCUSS ISSUES WITH OUR MEMBERS I CAN TELL YOU THAT MOST MEMBERS ASSUME THAT SUCH COMMUNICATIONS ARE CONFIDENTIAL AND THAT THAT INFORMATION WILL NOT BE IN A THIS CLOSE TO THE EMPLOYER OR OTHER THIRD PARTIES. REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE UNION COMMUNICATE WITH OUR MEMBERS ON A NUMBER OF SENSITIVE ISSUES INCLUDING WORKPLACE DISCIPLINE GRIEVANCES SEXUAL ASSAULT HARASSMENT CIVIL RIGHTS VIOLATIONS AND ANYTHING ELSE YOU CAN THINK OF IT'S IMPORTANT FOR OUR WORK IN RESOLVING WORKPLACE PROBLEMS CHEN UNFILTERED CONVERSATIONS WITH OUR MEMBERS. THAT WE KNOW EVERYTHING INVOLVED IN A SITUATION. WE FREQUENTLY NEED TO GIVE A VERY BLUNT ADVICE TO OUR MEMBERS AND SOMETIMES WE LEARN SOME REALLY CONCERNING BEHAVIOR THAT OUR EMPLOYEES ENGAGE IN. IT IS ONLY BY EIGHT KNOWING THESE DETAILS THAT WE CAN ENCOURAGE A FAIR RESOLUTION. I'VE THREE RECENT AREAS TO SHARE WITH YOU THAT ILLUSTRATE THE NEED FOR PRIVILEGED COMMUNICATION BETWEEN UNION REPRESENTATIVES AND MEMBERS -- IN THE FIRST SCENARIO RECENTLY AT TWO SEPARATE ARBITRATIONS WE LEARNED THAT THE LONG BEACH STATE ADMINISTRATION AND THE SACRAMENTO STATE ADMINISTRATION COME THROUGH THE EMAILS OF FACULTY MEMBERS TO FIND THEIR CORRESPONDENCE WITH UNION REPRESENTED. REPRESENTATIVES AND OTHERS. THIS YEAR'S YOU LAWYER COMMENTED THAT THERE IS NO PRIVILEGE BETWEEN A MEMBER IN THERE SEE IF A LEADERS AND ADVOCATES. AND BY DENYING PRIVILEGE THE CSU WAS ABLE TO TAKE THESE EMAIL CORRESPONDENCES OUT OF CONTEXT I MIGHT ADD AND PRESENT THEM AT AN ARBITRATION. THE SECOND SCENARIO A CFA FIELD STAFF MEMBER AT SAN JOSE WAS SERVED WITH A SUBPOENA FOR ALL FOR EMAILS WITH THAT AGAIN WHO IS SERVICING THE CSU FOR CIVIL RIGHTS VIOLATIONS. THAT LITIGANT ENGAGED IN NUMEROUS EMAILS A CFA ABOUT HER EMPLOYMENT RIGHT AS A FACULTY MEMBER THIS YEAR'S YOU GOT ALL OF THEM BECAUSE THE FIELD STAFF MEMBER COULD NOT AVOID COMPLYING WITH THE SUBPOENA. AND THEN JUST RECENTLY ABOUT A MONTH AGO WE ARE ISSUED SUBPOENA BY LATE AGAIN ASKING FOR INFORMATION ABOUT GRIEVANCES FILED BY ANOTHER CFA MEMBER WHO WAS NOT INVOLVED IN LITIGATION. IF UNIONS COULD AFFORD AN ARMY OF IT LAWYERS THIS WOULD NOT BE AN ISSUE. REPRESENTATION BUT REPRESENTATION WORK IS PERFORMED BY FACTORY VOLUNTEERS AND TRAIN STAFF MOST OF WHOM ARE NOT ATTORNEYS. BUT TO MY COLLEAGUES ARE ATTORNEYS BUT I AM NOT AND THAT MEANS THAT THE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN MY COLLEAGUES IN MEMBERS IS PRIVILEGED COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN ME IN THOSE MEMBERS IS NOT. AND THAT MEANS THAT OUR MEMBERS. WE'LL HAVE PRIVILEGE ONLY IF THEY GET ASSIGNED THE RIGHT UNION REPRESENTATIVE. I THANK YOU A LOT OF TIMES TO OUR NEXT WITNESS THANK YOU. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS STEVEN WEBER AND THE LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS MANAGER WITH ASSN CALIFORNIA I WANNA BEGIN BY THANKING THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER KALRA FOR HIS LEADERSHIP ON THIS BILL. AND TAKING THE COMMITTEE CONSULTANT FOR THE CONTINUE DILIGENT WORK. THE COMMITTEE IS WELL AWARE OF THE PUBLIC POLICY CONCERNS A GIVE RISE TO A COULD TURN CLAIM PRIVILEGE. THE LEGISLATURE HAS DECIDED THEIR SUBSTANTIAL SOCIAL INTERESTS THAT JUSTICE IS BEST SERVED WHEN A CLIENT IS A TRUSTING RELATIONSHIP WITH THEIR ATTORNEY. THERE'S A COMPLETE TRANSFER INFORMATION WITHOUT THE CHILLING EFFECT BROUGHT UPON BY CONCERNS OF CONFIDENTIALITY. THAT SAME POLICY INTEREST EXISTS IN EMPLOYEE UNION REPRESENTATIVE RELATIONSHIP. WHEN A UNION REPRESENT EMPLOYEE GOING THROUGH A PROCESS THAT ARE LEGAL FRAMEWORK HAS CREATED? SIXTY VICE AND GUIDANCE OF THEIR UNION AGENT. THAT AGING IS LEGALLY REQUIRED TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE UNDER THE DOCTRINE OF FAIR REPRESENTATION. LIKE THE ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE THERE'S COMPELLING POLICY INTEREST IN ENSURING THAT EMPLOYEE CAN FREELY IN COMPLETELY SHARE PRIVATE INFORMATION OF THEIR CHOOSING WITH THEIR REPRESENTATIVE. WHEN IT WHEN EMPLOYEES A VICTIM OF HARASSMENT OR DISCRIMINATION THEY SHOULD BE ENTITLED TO SHARE THAT INFORMATION WITH THE REPRESENT OF THE DAY FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH? WITHOUT THE CONCERNED THEIR PRIVATE CONVERSATION HAD WELL SEEKING HELP COULD BE PUBLICLY REVEALED. CONFIDENTIALLY A COMPANY CHARITY CREATED BY THE PRIVILEGE WILL FURTHER THE SENSE OF TRUST BETWEEN THE POLICE AND THEIR UNION. ENCOURAGING COMPLETE SHARING OF INFORMATION WILL HELP UNION REPRESENTATIVES MAKE MORE COMPLETE AND ACCURATE RECOMMENDATIONS DISCOURAGING NUMBER TERM NON MERITORIOUS CASES. LEADING TO MORE EFFICIENT AND EQUITABLE EDUCATION. GIVEN INJURY PRIVILEGE CREATED MAYBE FOR A TEENS NARROWLY TAILORED. IT TOUCHES ARBITRATIONS OR THE COURT ADMINISTRATIVE BOARD OR AGENCY PROCEEDINGS. IN CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS IT DOES NOT ATTACH. THE COMMUNICATIONS IN FURTHERANCE OR EIGHT OF A CRIME OBVIOUSLY IT DOES NOT ATTACH. IF THE IF IT'S COMMUNICATION BETWEEN EMPLOYER UNION REPRESENTATIVE BUT OUTSIDE OF THE SCOPE OF THE ROLE OF REPRESENTING THE EMPLOYEE OR NOT TRANSMITTED IN CONFIDENCE. THAT IT DOES NOT ATTACH. IF IT'S AN EMPLOYER RUN WORKPLACE INVESTIGATION IT'S OUTSIDE OF THE SCOPE OF A BEFORE EIGHTEEN AND THE EVIDENCE FOR PRIVILEGE WOULD NOT ATTACH. AB FOURTEEN IS A TIGHTLY DRAFTED BILL BY ENCOURAGING COMPLETE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN EMPLOYED REPRESENTATIVE IT WILL BE TO SWIFTER MORE ACCURATE AND MORE JUST EDUCATED PROCESSES. I PROTECT BY PROTECTING TRUST ON POWER THOSE THAT ARE VICTIMS OF HARASSMENT OR DISCRIMINATION SEEK HELP. WE'RE GRATEFUL FOR THE COMMITTEES TIME AND RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A VOTE THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHER WITNESSES IF YOU JUST GIVE YOUR NAME AND AFFILIATION AND I'M SURE THIRTY QUESTIONS WILL BE INVITING YOU BACK TO THE TO THE SHOCK HOUSES THE SERVICE EMPLOYEES INTERNATIONAL UNION ALSO IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU. MICHAEL YOUNG WITH THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION WHEN THE CO SPONSORED THE BILL ALSO YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT PLEASE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS MEGAN SUPERS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS AND THE WRITERS GUILD OF AMERICA WEST IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ARE YOU GROWING WE HAVE THE CALIFORNIA FACULTY ASSOCIATION A CO SPONSOR AS RIVAL. THANK YOU. THE BAKER WITH THEIR NEW DISSOCIATES FOR THE PROFESSIONAL ENGINEERS IN CALIFORNIA GOVERNMENT IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU. JACK SOME OF THE CALIFORNIA NURSES ASSOCIATION HERE IN STRONG SUPPORT. THANK YOU. RIGHT NOW SOME WITH THE AMERICAN FEDERATION OF STATE COUNTY MUNICIPAL EMPLOYEES -- I JUST WANT TO REGISTER SUPPORT ON BEHALF OF ASKED ME COUNCIL FIFTY SEVEN WHICH IS WHEN THE CHRISTMAS. THANK YOU. SACRAMENTO MAY HAVE THE CALIFORNIA THAT A CONFERENCE OF OPERATING ENGINEERS HERE IN STRONG SUPPORT [inaudible] THANK YOU. BREMBO HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION IN STRONG SUPPORT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. IN STEP FORWARD. THE FUTURE MEMBERS TING HUTCHINGS REPRESENTING THE LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA CITIES IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL I'M YOU KNOW. PRIMARILY WE'RE CONCERNED THAT I UNDER THIS MEASURE THE STATE WOULD BEGRANTING A LEVEL OF A PRIVILEGE. YOU KNOW REALLY REALIZE FOR SPECIFIED PROFESSIONALS ATTORNEYS FOLKS IN THE MEDICAL PROFESSION AND YOU KNOW ALL OF WHICH REQUIRE SOME SORT OF AN OLD QUALIFICATION -- OTHER THAN FAMILIAL PRIVILEGE -- YOU KNOW SUCH AS A SPOUSE -- SECONDARILY OUR CONCERNS REALLY ALIGNED WITH THOSE OF FORMER GOVERNOR BROWN WHEN HE VETOED A SIMILAR MEASURE THAT -- DESPITE WHAT -- WAS ARTICULATED BY THE SPONSORS AND THAT WAS RESIDE IN THE ANALYSES WE DO BELIEVE THAT IT COULD -- INHIBIT AN AGENCY'S ABILITY TO CONDUCT INVESTIGATIONS INTO WORKPLACE MISCONDUCT -- YOU KNOW CITY OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT OR OTHER OTHER THINGS THAT THAT HAVE BECOME. QUITE HEIGHTENED OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS -- WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO TRY AND GIVE FOLKS THAT THAT WORK FOR OUR CITIES THE ABILITY. TO ASCERTAIN ALL THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE -- RATHER THAN -- HAVE OF FOLKS INVOKE A PRIVILEGE ON OTHERS THAT COULD BE WITNESSES TO A PARTICULAR SITUATION I YOU KNOW THAT THE SPONSORS HAD MENTIONED THAT YOU KNOW IT IS ASSUMED THAT -- PEOPLE THAT THAT WHEN THEY SPEAK TO THEIR SHOP STEWARD -- THAT -- THAT IT IS PROTECTED IT IS PRIVILEGE I THINK OF A MORE SIMPLE APPROACH WE DID BE SIMPLY TO EDUCATE YOUR EMPLOYEES -- THAT IT IS NOT PROTECTED WE THIS LEGISLATURE'S GRANTED THE ABILITY FOR UNION EMPLOYEE ORIENTATIONS FOR ALL EMPLOYEES -- COULD BE A PERFECT OPPORTUNITY TO WALK THROUGH SOME OF THE DO'S AND DON'TS -- GIVEN THAT WE HAVE THE ABILITY FOR OUR ARE. REPRESENTED MEMBERS TO TWO IN LESS THE SERVICES OF THEIR ATTORNEY -- WHERE THERE THAT IT PRIVILEGE IS -- ENJOYED -- SO WE DO FOR THOSE REASONS AGAIN WE BELIEVE MR MEASURES UNNECESSARY WILL INHIBIT INVESTIGATIONS IS NOT REQUIRE. ANY SPECIFIED EDUCATION A MINIMAL QUALIFICATIONS WITHOUT WORK. THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS IN OPPOSITION GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS LEAH SILVERTHORNE WITH CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE. CATCHING PROPOSES THIS BILL BECAUSE AS MY COLLEAGUE SUGGESTED IT WOULD EXTEND ABROAD PRIVILEGE TYPICALLY RESERVED FOR HIGHLY REGULATED INDUSTRIES SUCH AS LAWYERS DOCTORS THERAPISTS. AND FOR SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP SUCH AS SPOUSES DOMESTIC VIOLENCE WORKERS AND CLERGY. ADDITIONALLY UNLIKE THE ATTORNEY COMPLEX CLIENT PRIVILEGE WHICH HAS BEEN. EXPRESSED BY THE PROPONENTS BILLS DRAFTED SUCH THAT IT WOULD ALLOW UNION REPRESENTED TO PROHIBIT NON UNION EMPLOYEES WHO ARE NOT PART OF THAT EMPLOYEE AGENT RELATIONSHIP OF SPEAKING TO OTHERS. AND CAN ALSO INTERFERE WITH EMPLOYER INVESTIGATION AND ISSUE SUCH AS HARASSMENT. ATTORNEYS DOCTORS AND MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS ARE HIGHLY REGULATED BY THE STATES AND COURTS IN THE APPLICATION OF THE PRIVILEGE THE SCOPE OF THE PRIVILEGE AND COULD BE HAULED BEFORE THE COR A REGULATORY BODY IF THEIR CONDUCT IS NOT PROTECT THEIRCLIENTS. NO SUCH PROTECTION IS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS BILL IN ADDITION A PRIVILEGE SUCH AS THIS IS NARROWLY CIRCUMCISED IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSCRIBED. IN THE DIFFERENT DIFFERENT WORDS IN THE CONTEXT OF ITS. CLIENT PRIVILEGE [inaudible] MY INTO CONTEXT OF AN ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE FOR EXAMPLE TO ONLY THOSE COMMUNICATIONS NECESSARY FOR THE GIVING LEGAL ADVICE AND DOES NOT APPLY TO FAX UNDERLYING THE COMMUNICATIONS. NO SUCH NARROWING IS INCLUDED IN THIS BILL MANNER SOME GOOD PLANS IN THERE THEY COULD MAKE NOT GOING TO TODAY -- THIS POLICY REASONS THAT THE POLICY REASONS REYES BY THE PHONE IT'S NOT APPEAR TO RISE TO THE LEVEL OF THE SPECIAL ELATIONSHIP SUCH AS MARRIAGE RELIGION OR DOMESTIC ABUSE OR TRAUMA SITUATIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THE THE PRIVILEGES. CODIFIED STATUTE WILL ALSO LEAD TO DIFFICULTIES IN LITIGATION AND NOT LITIGATION LIKE BECAUSE WHERE IS MY PROPONENT SUGGESTED THAT THIS ONLY ATTACH IS IN LITIGATION ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS. IS NECESSARY TO CONTINUALLY ASSERT A PRIVILEGE IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN IT OR RISK WAIVER PRIOR TO THIS THE FILING OF A LITIGATION OR ARBITRATION. FOR THESE REASONS AND OTHERS CAL CHAMBER RESPECTFULLY OPPOSES A BEFORE EATING -- MUCH I I SWEAR THAT THE CHAMBER T. TEACHES ITS LOBBYIST TO SPEAK FASTER THAN A SPEEDING BULLET. WELL I THINK I CAUGHT MOST OF IT SO. THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION NAME AND AFFILIATION PLEASE HEAR ABOUT JUST AT THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF SCHOOL BUSINESS OFFICIALS. I WOULD LOVE TO AND THERE MAY BE A QUESTION FOR YOU BUT WE'RE NOT GOING TO CREATE ANY EXCEPTIONS AT THE MOMENT THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. AND I'M SURE MEMBERS MIKE BELOW FOR CIVIL JUSTICE ASSOCIATION IN A OPPOSITION THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS MARIA SPERBER ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. IN BREAKING WITH THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA HEALTHCARE DISTRICTS ALSO IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON JOSH DUGGAR REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES AND TODAY ON BEHALF OF COLLEAGUES AT THE SPECIAL DISTRICTS ASSOCIATION IN THE URBAN COUNTIES OF CALIFORNIA. OPPOSE FOR THE REASONS STATED THANK YOU THANK YOU WAS THERE ANYONE ELSE HERE IN OPPOSITION. ANYONE IN NEUTRALITY. ALL RIGHT SEEING NON -- SURE I SURE DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. ALL RIGHT WE'LL START WITH THE VICE CHAIR AND THEY WILL GO OVER TO SENATOR ON BURKE. I THINK MOST OF MY CONCERNS HAD PROBABLY ALREADY BEEN ARTICULATED BY FOLKS WHO MIGHT FALL ON THE OTHER SIDE ON THIS ISSUE -- I UNDERSTAND THE DESIRE TO HAVE -- UNION OFFICIALS AND WORKERS HAVE A FREE FLOW OF COMMUNICATION -- MY CONCERN THOUGH IS ELEVATING THAT TO A LEVEL THAT. IS NORMALLY AFFORDED TO PROFESSIONS LIKE MEDICINE OR LAW -- OR RELIGIOUS LEADERS. I'M AFRAID THAT IF WE WERE TO EXTEND IT. THEN THIS WOULD LITERALLY OPEN UP THE GATES FOR PRIVILEGES ACROSS THE BOARD. BECAUSE IF THIS WERE TO HAPPEN TODAY OR IS A MOVES THROUGH THE PROCESS -- WOULD NOT A NON REPRESENTED EMPLOYEE WHO SEEKS INFORMAL COUNSEL. FROM SOMEONE ALSO. USING THE SAME ARGUMENTATION. THAT I WANT TO HAVE THE FREE FLOW OF IDEAS IN SEEK ADVICE FROM THOSE IN A FORMAL OR INFORMAL CAPACITY. I DON'T KNOW WE COULD HOW WE COULD ARGUE. THAT NO THIS EXCLUSION IS GOOD BUT THIS ALLOWING ON REPRESENTED EMPLOYEES. FROM HAVING THAT SEEM FREE FLOW OF INFORMATION HOW WOULD BE ABLE TO STOP THAT EITHER. I THINK THIS IS. A UNIQUE SITUATION BUT THE CONSEQUENCES OF EXTENDING THIS PRIVILEGE I THINK COULD BE VERY DANGEROUS. BECAUSE I THINK WAS MENTIONED BEFORE. THIS IS BEEN. PRUDENCE AT CERTAIN -- CERTAIN PROTECTIONS HAVE BEEN PUT INTO PLACE. THEY ARE HIGHLY REGULATED THEY DO REQUIRE CREDENTIALS LICENSING SO ON AND SO FORTH. BUT UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES THOSE QUALIFICATIONS AND AND PROFESSIONAL REQUIREMENTS. DON'T DON'T APPEAR TO BE S. AS STRICT -- IS THERE ANOTHER WAY FORWARD. THAT CAN ALLOW FOR A FREE FLOW OF INFORMATION MAYBE I'LL ASK THE THE AUTHOR -- WHEN YOU WENT THROUGH THIS PROCESS DID YOU CONTEMPLATE ANY OTHER OPTION OTHER THAN? EXTENDING THE PRIVILEGE IN SUCH A WAY THAT WOULD BE MORE POWERFUL THAN THE EXISTING ATTORNEY CLIENT. THAT'S WHERE IT IS RIGHT NOW YOU'VE EXTENDED THAT PROTECTION. THAT IS NOT JUST HELD BY THE CLIENT IT'S NOW HELD BY. THE OTHER PRINCIPLE. AND THAT'S JUST THAT'S A STRIKING DEVIATION. OFF FROM THE ATTORNEY CLIENT RIGHT THERE SO YOU'RE ASKING FOR MORE PROTECTIONS THAN ARE GIVEN TO LEARN A PROFESSIONS. BUT IN THE PROCESS AND YOU THOUGHT OF ANY OTHER WAY THAT THIS. IS PROTECTIONS COULD BE ACCOMPLISHED WITHOUT. PLEASE. CHAIR. THANK YOU THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THINKING SENATOR -- I WANT TO START BY SAYING THAT. THIS IS NOT SOMETHING NEW. THIS PROVISIONS EXIT IS THIS A NUMBER OF OTHER STATES. OUT FOR FORTY YEARS IS BECAUSE THIS IN NEW YORK. AND I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS THE APPROPRIATE WAY TO APPROACH SYSTEM AND IT IS IT IS DISTINGUISHABLE FROM ATTORNEY CLIMBS ATTORNEY CLIENT THE ATTORNEY. HAS THAT SPECIFIC RESPONSIBILITY TO THAT CLIENT. AND IN THIS CASE BOTH THE UNION AGENT AND UP THE WORKER HOUSE BEING REPRESENTED. THERE'S NO DOUBT THE AGING ALSO HAS RESPONSIBLE THAT WORKER BUT THE THERE'S ALSO RESPONSIBILITY. TO THE LARGER ENTITY RIGHT AND SO. IN AND BUT WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO THE COMMENTS FROM UP OUR REPRESENT LEAGUE IS THAT THE CITIES. WHEN  WAS ON THE SOUND IS CITY COUNCIL? THE SUGGESTION THAT SOMEHOW. THE CITY WAS LOOKING OUT FOR THE BEST INTEREST OF THE EMPLOYEE. YOU KNOW I I JUST DON'T THINK IT'S FACTUAL I THINK WERE FINDING MORE MORE CONTENTION THAT'S EXISTING. BETWEEN OF THE MANAGEMENT WHETHER IT BE PRIVATE SECTOR OR PUBLIC AND THE WORKER AND SO THAT'S WHY THAT PROTECTION NEEDS TO BE THERE FOR BOTH. ENDS OF THIS COMMUNICATION BECAUSE OFTEN TIMES THE COMMUNICATIONS BEING USED AGAINST ALL WORKERS. WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO I THE CONTRACT NEGOTIATIONS ARE COMES DOWN TO A WHOLE WIDE SLEW OF ISSUES THAT NOW? ARE BEING MORE AND MORE THE THE AGGRESSIVELY OF CONFLICTED WITH THE IN IN THIS DAY AND AGE. THAT'S WHY I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS NARROWLY TAILORED AS NECESSARY FOR THE PURPOSE OF PROTECTING THAT RELATIONSHIP. HOW WOULD THIS BE DIFFERENT? IF YOU HAD AN ON REPRESENTED EMPLOYEE WHO SOUGHT THE INFORM INFORMAL COUNCIL. OUR REGARDING WORKPLACE ISSUE SHOULD THAT INDIVIDUAL BE AFFORDED PROTECTION TO PROMOTE. FREE DISCOURSE OF THOUGHTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS. THROUGH THE CHAIR AT OUT -- I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE UNION REPRESENTATIVE HAS A LEGAL OBLIGATIONS REPRESENT. MEMBERS AND NON MEMBERS ALL WORKERS ARE COVERED UNDER THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT SO REGARDLESS IF YOU'RE A MEMBER OF THE UNION OR IF YOU'RE NOT A MEMBER IF YOU'RE COVERED UNDER THAT. SELECT BARGAINING AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE THE YOUR PRESENT IT HAS A LEGAL OBLIGATION TO REPRESENT YOU IN THOSE MATTERS I THINK THAT'S A DISTINCTION FROM AN EMPLOYEE TALKING. TO SOME THIRD PARTY TO GET ADVICE WORDS -- TO TO TO GAUGE INTEREST OR THINGS LIKE THAT THAT THAT THAT A LEGAL OBLIGATION REPRESENTATION WOULDN'T EXIST IN THAT MATTER SO IT'S A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS SENATOR UMBERG. YOU RAISE AN INTERESTING POINT JUST -- SUMMER KALRA YOU'D SAID THAT THERE IS IF I UNDERSTOOD YOU CORRECTLY THERE IS A DUTY TO THE INDIVIDUAL WHO COMMUNICATES TO THE AGENT. IS THAT RIGHT THAT'S CORRECT AND THEN AT THAT AGING HAS A DUTY TO THE UNION AS WELL IS THAT RIGHT. AND SO IT IS IN IN THIS HYPOTHETICAL THAT'S A RESPONSIBILITY TO BUT NOT THAT THE PRIVILEGES NOT FOR THE I'M. I'M IN GENERAL THERE'S RESPONSIBILITY TO THE UNION BUT THIS CASE THAT THIS PRIVILEGES BETWEEN. IN REPRESENTATIVE AND THE WORKER HAND IN PLACE. AND SO IT'S A TWO WAY BE. A MOTHER BARBARA THERE'S THERE'S NOT EXPENSE A PRIVILEGE TO THE ENTIRE ORGANIZATION ALL THIS ALL THE WORKERS. OKAY LOOK LET ME ASK YOU A HYPOTHETICAL IT'S BASED ON REAL EVENTS. SO IF TO EMPLOYEES EMPLOYEE ONE LET'S ASSUME AS A WOMAN EMPLOYEE TO LET'S ASSUME IS A MAN. PLOY ONE REPORTS TO MANAGEMENT THAT EMPLOYEE TO IS CALLED HER SIX TIMES THE PREVIOUS DAY. FIVE TIMES A DAY BEFORE THAT FOUR TIMES THE BEFORE THAT SHE'S NOT RESPONDED EMPLOYEE TO HAS MADE. INAPPROPRIATE OVERTURES TO HER EMPLOYEE TO HIS VISITOR HOUSE A NUMBER OF TIMES THE LAST FOR FIVE DAYS. EMPLOYEE ONE THE WOMAN REPORTS AT THE MANAGEMENT MANAGEMENT. IS CONCERNED AND THEY DISCIPLINE EMPLOYEE TO EMPLOYEE TO GOES TO HIS UNION AGENT AND SAYS. I'M NOT HARASSING HER I DON'T CONSIDER THESE PHONE CALLS AND VISITS TO HER HOME TO BE HARASSMENT AND I INTEND TO CONTINUE TO DO EXACTLY THAT BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT IF I CONTINUE THIS BEHAVIOR THAT THIS WOMAN EVENTUALLY. WILL SEE THE LIGHT AND BASICALLY HAVE A RELATIONSHIP. SO THE QUESTION IS IS THE UNION AGENT WHO HAS RECEIVED THIS DISCLOSURE DOES HERE SHE HAVE ANY DUTY TO EMPLOYEE NUMBER. ONE SO IN OTHER WORDS DOES DOES THE UNION AGENT THEN HAVE ANY DUTY TO COME FORWARD. TO SAY THAT THIS EMPLOYEE IS GOING TO CONTINUE THIS BY ALL ACCOUNTS OTHER THAN UNION THE OTHER THAN EMPLOYEE TWOS. HARASSMENT OF EMPLOYEE NUMBER. ONE THERE'S NOT A IN THE PROPOSED BILL THERE'S THERE'S NOT A DUTY TO AN ACID BUT THE PRIVILEGE WOULD NOT ATTACHED IF THERE WAS IT WAS AN ON GOING -- CRIMES SO IF THERE WAS CITY ROSE LEVEL OF BEING CRIMINAL BY THEN DID YOU WOULDN'T HAVE A DUTY TO REPORT BUT THEY WERE THERE WOULD BE NO PROTECTION. UNDER THE PRIVILEGE EXIT THE THIS IS NOT A CRIME WELL IT COULD BE A CRIME THIS IS STALKING. WELL IT IS CLEAR THAT THE REFS BUT THERE'S THERE'S A THERE'S A QUESTION THERE AS TO WHAT LEVEL WHAT RISE THE LEVEL. OF A CRIME AND WHO MAKES THAT DETERMINATION. SO THE SECOND QUESTION THEN IS. IF IT EVEN ATTORNEY RECEIVES A COMMUNICATION AND THE ATTORNEY DISCLOSE IT RIGHT. SO BY THE WAY EVEN IF IT'S A AN OUT AND OUT THE THE ATTORNEY IS ONLY REQUIRED TO DISCLOSE IF THERE'S GOING TO BE IMMINENT BODILY HARM OR SOME OTHER. SERIOUS HARM. THERE'S NO INDICATION AS HARM HERE THE QUESTION IS IS LET'S SAY THAT UNION AGENT THEN SAYS YOU KNOW WHAT I AM GOING TO PROTECT EMPLOYEE NUMBER. ONE I'M GOING TO INFORM EMPLOYEE NUMBER ONE THAT THIS PERSON IS CAN GOING TO CONTINUE TO HARASS. YOU IS THERE ANY SANCTION THAT IS APPLIED TO THE UNION AGENT FOR EXAMPLE AN ATTORNEY WHO DISCLOSE AN ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE COMMUNICATION THEN CAN BE POTENTIALLY BEEN DISBARRED SO IS THERE ANY. SANCTION IT CAN BE APPLIED TO THE UNIONREPRESENTATIVE. NOT IT NOT IN THE LEGISLATION AND AS YOU POINT OUT CENTER THAT SANCTION WOULD COME FROM THE A PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATION -- NOT THROUGH THROUGH THAT ORGANIZATION NOT THROUGH THE LAW. WE HAVE A GOOD IF YOU'D LIKE CANCER THAT ARE ON BURKE MITCHELL CAST OF SERVICE EMPLOYEES INTERNATIONAL UNION WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO BOTH EMPLOYEES. AND THERE HAVE BEEN PLENTY OF INSTANCES WITH ONE EMPLOYEE HARASSING ANOTHER -- IF THE EMPLOYEE WHO IS THE HARASSERS BREAKING WORKPLACE RULES CLEARLY BROKEN APOSTLES WE DON'T HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO REPRESENT THAT PERSON IF THEY COMMIT CRIMES. ARE CLEARLY IN VIOLATION OF WORKS WE ADVISE THEM. ON CERTAIN. I'M. ADVICE TO SEIZE BEHAVIOR CERTAIN THINGS LIKE THAT BUT THEY'RE CLEARLY IN VIOLATION -- WE MAY ADVISE THEM THAT THEY'RE GOING TO GET TERMINATED OR WHATEVER GIVEN DIRECTION BUT WE ARE NOT. NECESSARILY. TO REPRESENT SOMEBODY WHO'S CLEARLY VIOLATING CERTAIN RULES BOSTIC'S AFTER OUR OBLIGATIONS TO BOTH EMPLOYEES. ALL RIGHT SO I I AM. I'VE TO THAT AND APPRECIATE YOU SAYING THAT APPARENTLY. IF IF I COULD ASK THE QUESTION MADAM CHAIR THEN. CERTAINLY THROUGH THE CHAIR. IF THEN SO UNDER THE SUN ARE YOU JUST DESCRIBED. THEN USING THE HYPOTHETICAL THAT I PROVIDED EMPLOYEE ONE BEING THE WOMAN WHO'S BEING IN MY VIEW HARASS EMPLOYED TO BEING THE HARASSER. THAT THE AGENT THE UNION AGENT THEN. WOULD BE ELIGIBLE WOULD BE -- AND WITH THERE'S A DUTY BUT THERE'D BE NO SANCTION IF THE UNION AGENT THEN INFORMED OTHERS OF THIS HARASSMENT IS GOING TO CONTINUE [inaudible] WELL. I WANT TO CLARIFY THAT THIS ONLY. DEALS WITH SUBPOENA POWERS. SO. I'M NOT ENTIRELY SURE YOUR WITH YOUR QUESTION AS I THINK. SO HERE'S OUR LET ME JUST CAPSIZE MY TWO CONCERNS CONCERN NUMBER ONE IS. IF IF NOT RISING TO THE LEVEL OF IMMINENT. HARM PHYSICAL HARM WHETHER OR NOT THERE THERE COULD BE SOME SORT OF MODIFICATIONS SO THAT TO THE EXTENT THAT. THE UNION AGENT RECEIVES COMMUNICATION THAT WOULD INDICATE THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE SOME OTHER CONTINUING HARM NUMBER ONE NOT RISE IN THE SAME LEVEL IS REQUIRED TO BE DISCLOSED BY AN ATTORNEY. AND THEN NUMBER TWO THAT SORT OF THE FLIP SIDE OF THIS IS IT IF THE IF THE COMMUNICATOR BELIEVES THAT THERE IS A PRIVILEGE THAT IS SACROSANCT -- THAT IF THAT UNION REP THEN REVEALS THAT INFORMATION FOR WHATEVER REASON THAT THERE BE SOME SANCTION OTHER THAN. THERE THERE BE SOME SANCTION PROVIDED IN THE LAW MUCH IS THERE IS FOR AN ATTORNEY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU I THINK INCLUDE CLARIFY FOR ME IF I'M WRONG I THINK WHAT YOU WOULD HAVE IN THIS INSTANCE IS THE AGENT SAYING. THERE IS NO PRIVILEGE HERE BECAUSE YOU WERE VIOLATING WORKPLACE RULES ENSURED A SUBPOENA ISSUE FOR THIS INFORMATION. OUR I WOULD HAVE TO RESPOND SO I THINK PART OF THIS IS THE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN AGENT AND WORKER. SO THAT THERE IS CLARITY AS TO WHAT THE AGENT CAN AND CANNOT DO BUT IF THE WORKER [inaudible] WORKPLACE RULES. POTENTIALLY ACTING IN A CRIMINAL MATTER THERE IS NO PROTECTION FOR A SUBPOENA AND IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN THE THE AGENT WOULD SO ADVISED THE WORKER THAT THERE IS NO SUCH PRIVILEGE ATTACHING TO THIS COMMUNICATION. AND WOULD YOU CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG ON THAT. I'M SURE I BELIEVE YOU'RE RIGHT AS IT RELATES TO CRIMINAL MATTERS YES. THE UNION DOES HAVE AN OBLIGATION REPRESENT THE EMPLOYEE THROUGH THE FOUR CORNERS THE CONTRACT TO A DEGREE BEEN SICK ISSUE AT THE WORKPLACE IS THAT YOU CAME IN LATE OR HERE'S AN ISSUE. LIKE THAT BUT ONCE IT WANTS TO ELEVATE SO CRIMINAL MATTER AT THE END THAT SEPARATE NOW I'D LIKE YOU TO RESPOND I THINK THAT THAT'S A FAIR QUESTION BY SENATOR UMBERG YOU'VE GOT. CONFLICTING ISSUES HERE BETWEEN. INDIVIDUAL A AN INDIVIDUAL BE BOTH SEEKING ASSISTANCE FROM THEIR AGENTS. I AM ASSUMING THEY'RE DIFFERENT AGENTS ARE NOT THE SAME WHAT IS THE ROLE IN THIS LEGISLATION IF ANY. OF THE AGENT THE SERVI ARMED. NOT VICTIMS INDIVIDUAL BE THE SECOND THE THE THE ONE WHO WAS ARGUABLY HARASSING WHICH IS ARGUABLY A CRIMINAL MATTER BUT LET'S SAY IT DOESN'T RISE QUITE TO THAT LEVEL BUT IT IS. A WORK FORCE VIOLATION WHAT IS A RESPONSIBILITY THE AGENT AT THAT POINT. I'M NOT SURE I FULLY UNDERSTAND IF IT RELATES TO A DUTY TO NOTIFY EMPLOYEE A OR IF IT'S A DUTY TO REPRESENT EMPLOYEE A I BELIEVE THAT YOU KNOW NO NO THE QUESTION IS IT REALLY EMPLOYEE BE. THE ONE WHO WAS ACKNOWLEDGE SHE'S GONNA KEEP MAKING THOSE PHONE CALLS BECAUSE THIS WOMAN JUST NEEDS MORE PERSISTENCE IN ORDER TO YOU KNOW. TO TO REALIZE WHAT A WONDERFUL IDEA THIS GUY IS -- BUT YOU'VE GOT SOMEONE WHO IS. VIOLATING YOUR RULES PROBABLY WORKPLACE ENGAGEMENT RULES AND CERTAINLY ARGUABLY THE TALKING. AS A CRIMINAL MATTER WHAT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THAT INDIVIDUAL'S AGENT. UNDER THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES. I BELIEVE IN YOU. AND THE REPRESENTED AT FROM FROM ATTY CORRECT CAN CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG I BELIEVE ASSUMING THAT EMPLOYEE BEES KINDA DOESN'T RISE TO CRIMINAL. RIGHT AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. NOW WE'RE JUST -- ISOLATING THIS TO A WORKPLACE ISSUE AND NOT A HYPOTHETICAL WORKPLACE ISSUE NOT I'M GOING TO MY CALL HER AGAIN TOMORROW BUT ISSUES THAT HAVE. HAPPENED IN THE PAST THAT I BELIEVE THE ONLY WOULD HAVE BEEN OUT WILL HAVE APPLICATIONS REPRESENT THAT EMPLOYEE OR WORKPLACE GRIEVANCES. AND WE'RE ALL SET THE LIST WE% HAVE TO REPRESENT EMPLOYEE A AS WELL. NOW IT'S TO THE EXTENT THAT EMPLOYEES BE KIND OF A RISE OF CRIMINAL THAT I BELIEVE AT THAT POINT IS WHEN OUR OBLIGATION -- TO TO WAIVE PRIVILEGE WOULDN'T% EXIST AS YOUR AS THE BILL IS CURRENTLY REPRESENTED BUT ASSUMING AGAIN THAT IS JUST A WORKPLACE ISSUE WORLD TO A WORKPLACE HARASSMENT SYSTEM HE THE INAPPROPRIATE EMAIL OR WENT TO AGREEMENTS PRICES. UNION WOULD STILL REPRESENT THAT EMPLOYEE IN THAT MANNER. EIGHT TO SET TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION ENTER OVER. I ASSUME THAT TO BE THE CASE. ONE SECOND I'M JUST CURIOUS AS TO HOW THIS WOULD PLAY OUT IN THE REAL WORLD WHERE YOU HAVE. TO EMPLOYEES BOTH UNION MEMBERS ONE HARASSING THE OTHER WHICH IS IS WAS POINT OUT NOT UNUSUAL SITUATION. THE BENCHER BY CONDEMNING THIS PRIVILEGE. PREVENT SOME PLAYERS ROUTINE ACCESS TO CONFIDENTIAL COMMUNICATIONS TO SUBPOENA POWERS. THERE ARE EVERY SINGLE DAY WITHIN UNIONS THERE ARE GRIEVANCES FROM ONE MEMBER TO ANOTHER THEIR ISSUES THAT THE UNION HAS PROCESSES FOR ASSAULTING -- THAT UP THAT THAT HAVE ACCOUNTABILITY STANDARDS THAT REPRESENTATION STANDARDS WHAT HAVE YOU SO THIS REALLY HAS MORE TO DO WITH THE ABILITY OF SUBPOENA POWERS BEING USED TO REVEAL THOSE KEYS COMMUNICATIONS. AN SO IT'S NOT MEANT TO HIDE CRIMINAL CONDUCT FOR CERTAIN AND THE REALITY IS THAT IF ANY INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYEE DOES TO THE MANAGEMENT AND PILES COMPLAIN. THOSE THOSE INVESTIGATIONS WILL PROCEED JUST AS THEY DO TODAY UNDER ORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES SO LAST COMMENT HERE AND THEN WE'RE GONNA GO TO SENATOR Y. CASKE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND JUST ADD A FINER POINT ON THIS ARE JUST A COUPLE OF THINGS HERE. ONE THE SCENARIO THAT YOU SPEAK TO IS NOT SPOKEN. REFERENCE IN THE BILL BECAUSE AS THE CHIEF THAT AUTHOR RIGHTFULLY POINTED OUT THE SITUATION TOOK PLACE ALL THE TIME THIS IS NOT AN ISSUE. WHERE WHICH WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THIS BILL PRIVILEGE? PROTECTS OR DOES NOT PROTECT. YOU A MEMBER THE PRIVILEGE. WE ARE SPEAKING TO IS TO PREVENT THE EMPLOYERS FROM USING AN END RUN AROUND. WORKPLACE RULES THAT HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED BY HERB THAT PREVENT. FIVE THE EMPLOYER FROM COMPELLING A UNION AGENT OR A MEMBER TO DISCLOSE WHAT -- INFORMATION -- IN A WORKPLACE SETTING WHAT EMPLOYERS ARE DOING IS TAKING THAT AND THEY ARE USING. THE DISCOVERY PROCESS IN LITIGATION TO GET AROUND THAT THIS ISSUE. REALLY IS FOCUSED ON THAT WHAT HAPPENS IN A SITUATION WHERE WE GO TO AN ADJUDICATORY ADJUDICATORY SETTING. AND I WORKERS. OR THE EMPLOYER IS LOOKING TO USED THE DISCOVERY PROCESS TO OBTAIN CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION ABOUT OUR MEMBERSHIP AND ENGAGEMENT. YOU KNOW WITH RESPECT THINGS LIKE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING ISSUES THAT ARE NOT GERMANE TO WORKPLACE INVESTIGATIONS THIS WOULD NOT IMPEDE AN EXISTING. THE EXISTING PROCESS FOR WORKPLACE INVESTIGATIONS BECAUSE EMPLOYERS CAN ALL ALREADY CAN NOT IN IN IN IN A WORKPLACE SETTING. COMPEL A UNION AGENT OR MEMBER UNDER THREAT OF PENALTY OR UNDER THREAT OF YOU KNOW TERMINATION -- THAT THAT TO TURN THIS INFORMATION OVER DISHES CLOSES THE LOOPHOLE THAT EXISTS WITH RESPECT TO LITIGATION. TO PREVENT EMPLOYERS FROM USING THE LITIGATION PROCESS TO DO SOMETHING THAT THEY CAN NOT DO IN THE EXISTING COLLECTIVE BARGAINING FRAMEWORK CONSTRUCTION WORK THANK YOU THANK YOU. SENATOR WHITE HOUSE CAN. AFTER I DID VOTE FOR THIS BILL LAST YEAR AND IT MAY IN FACT CLOSE A LOOPHOLE. THE V. THE EMPLOYER AND THE UNION REP BUT I'M CONCERNED IS THAT THERE'S NO SCOPE ON THIS PRIVILEGE. EVERYONE OF THE ATTORNEYS HERE THERE'S A CRIMINAL CASE WITH FIVE PEOPLE YOU'RE THE PUBLIC DEFENDER YOU GET ONE PERSON AND WE MAY HAVE DIFFERING OPINIONS. DIFFERENT IN OUR CLIENTS MAY HAVE DIFFERENT VIEWS AND THERE'S NOTHING IN HERE THAT LIMITS THAT'S GO FOR THE PRIVILEGE IN FACT IS THE VICE CHAIR SAYS YOU GIVE THE UNION REP. THE PRIVILEGE ALSO SO THAT'S A CONCERN TO ME AND THE OTHER CONCERN IS THAT YOU KNOW THESE UNION WRAPS. THERE. TELL ME YOUR SECRETS TELL ME EVERYTHING THEY COLLECT THESE THIS THIS CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION IS A WE SAKE DON'T TELL ME OR AS MY COLLEAGUE POINTED OUT I CAN BE SANCTIONED IF I USE THAT SO THERE'S NOTHING IN HERE. ABOUT THE EDUCATION FOR THE PREPARATION OR ALL THESE LITTLE CONCERNS. TELL ME YOUR STORIES TELL ME YOUR YOUR YOUR PROBLEMS AND AND DEAL WITH THESE. INTER COMPLEX WHEN THERE'S SOMETHING WITHIN THE EMPLOYEES THAT NOW THE WHOLE THE PRIVILEGE BEFORE THEY'VE NEVER PRIVILEGE NOW THEY HAVE A PRIVILEGE WHEN THEY SAY I DON'T NEED TO TELL YOU AND THAT'S A CONCERN THAT I DIDN'T CATCH LAST YEAR THE BOOK. SPOT AS OF THE THINK ABOUT JAIL IS CENTER LOOK AGAIN THIS IS. THERE ALREADY ARE THESE COMMUNICATIONS OCCURRING WITHIN THE CONTEXT YOU TO REPRESENTATION. AND THE UNIONS REPRESENT A NUMBER OF PEOPLE AND THERE'S A LOT OF ONE OFFS CONVERSATION ONE OF THAT A DRUG CONVERSATIONS. THIS REALLY HAS TO THE PRIVILEGE AGAIN AS WAS STATED BY MISTER ALLISON OF THE EMPLOYER HAVING ACCESS TO THESE COMMUNICATIONS RIGHT IT'S IT'S IT'S SPECIFIC TO THAT. IT'S NOT A MATTER OF YOU KNOW PEOPLE WHO THE THE UNION REPRESENTATIVE -- HAVING THESE CONVERSATIONS AND THEN THE SECOND. THIS THIS INFORMATION OTHERWISE IS NOT OUR THAT IS NOT OTHERWISE ATTAINABLE AT LEAST THROUGH. OF ANY FORCE PROCEDURE FROM THE EMPLOYER THAT IS THROUGH THAT SO THAT THESE COMMUNICATIONS IF SOMEONE SUBPOENAED. AND THESE COMMUNICATIONS ARE NOT PROTECTED THAT THAT IS THE I GET THIS PAIN APART MADAM CHAIR I GET TO SOON. APART BUT BUT WE KNOW IS ATTORNEYS IF SOMEBODY TELLS ME SOMETHING AND THERE'S A NON ATTORNEY ENDER THAT'S NOT A PRIVILEGED COMMUNICATION. JUST BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO BE ANOTHER TURNING IT HAVE TO BE A UNION REP. THERE'S NOTHING IN THIS BILL THAT EDUCATES THE DOOR A UNION REPRESENTATIVE SAID THAT'S NOT WHAT IS IT WHAT IS PRIVILEGE WHAT IS NOT PRIVILEGED WE KEEP GOING TO IT'S NOT A CRIME I GET THAT BUT THERE'S A BUNCH OF HARASSMENT IN. IN CHALLENGES IN THE WORK FORCE IF YOU'RE REPRESENTING EVERYBODY. THAT WE DON'T DO THAT IN THE LAW AND THE ON A PRIVILEGE WE REPRESENT ONE PERSON HEY YOU YOU RAISE A OF A GREAT POINT I WOULD NOTE THAT THE SCOPE REPRESENTATION IS DEFINED IN THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT. SO WHEN THE TWO PARTIES WHEN THE UNION AND THE MANAGEMENT -- ORGANIZATION SET THE TABLE THAT'S THE DOCUMENT THAT DEFINES OUR SCOPE REPRESENTATION AND IN OUR REPRESENTATION IS NARAL TO THE FOUR CORNERS THAT CONTRACT SO WHILE MIGHT NOT BE DELINEATED IN THE BILL. OBVIOUSLY YOU ONLY HAVE A UNION IN THE CONTEXT OF THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT AND THAT THE DOCUMENT YOU REFERRED TO FOR YOUR SCHOOL REPRESENTATION. AND AND MILLIONS ALL THE TIME. EDUCATE OUR STEWARDS AND EDUCATE -- ARE EVERYTHING IS STAFF WON THE CONTRACT IN IT IS WILL ASK HE'S NOT SHOULD ELABORATE AND SAY IT'S GOOD REPRESENTATION WILL ALSO BE DELINEATED AND THEIR COLLECTIVE BARGAINING STATUTES AS WELL SO. THOSE WILL BE THE DOCUMENTS THAT WOULD DELINEATE. OUR OBLIGATIONS TO THE EMPLOYEE WHICH WOULD BE NEGOTIATED WITH THE EMPLOYER. SO WOULD YOU BE. AND AND I UNDERSTAND THE CONCERN I THINK THE WITH THAT WERE KIND OF TALKING AT DIFFERENT LEVELS HERE WE'RE LOOKING AT THIS AS LAWYERS. YOU'RE LOOKING AT THIS AS THE RESPONSIBILITIES YOU HAVE PURSUANT TO A COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT WHICH ISN'T REFERENCED HERE. AND I WOULD LIKE TO SUGGEST THAT WORSE IS BILLS SUPPOSED TO GO NEXT. SENATE FLOOR -- WE NEED IT I THINK WE NEED TO CLARIFY THAT BECAUSE I THINK WE ALL SHARE THAT CONCERN AND AND SOME OF US HAVE STARTED FROM THIS PERSPECTIVE IN SOME OF OVER HERE. USING OUR EXPERIENCES LAWYERS WHERE WE DO A VERY SPECIFIC. NOT ONLY LIMITATIONS BUT SANCTIONS IF WE DON'T. RESPECT THAT RELATIONSHIP SO -- I WONDER IF WE COULD. PERHAPS. TIGHTEN THAT UP IF THAT IS THE I I I SHARE THAT CONCERN BUT I ALSO WAS FOCUSING ON THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING NATURE. IT SETS THE PARAMETERS BUT THAT'S NOT IT IS NOT CLEARLY SPECIFIED IN THE BILL MADAM CHAIR CENTERS I'M MORE THAN HAPPY TO TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS A WORK SPACE AND AND AND COME TO YOUR SPECIFIC OFFICES AS WE CONTINUE TO WORK TO CLARIFY. IT IS DIFFERENT THAN ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE I HAVE OBVIOUSLY VERY WELL AWARE. OF THE VERY -- ORTON A TRIP RELATIONSHIP TO THE ATTORNEY CLIENT. PRIVILEGE RIGHTFULLY HAS THIS IS A DIFFERENT KIND OF OF PRIVILEGE BUT I THINK THAT WOULD REQUIRE GREATER CLARITY THAN CURRENTLY EXISTS TO FOR THE COME FOR THE SENATE -- THE SENATORS AND SO I'M MORE THAN HAPPY TO GET YOU TO WORK ON THAT WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF YOUR YOUR STAFF IS I I THINK IT WOULD PROBABLY BE MOST HELPFUL IF YOU WORK DIRECTLY WITH OUR STAFF WE ALSO HEARD THIS BILL LAST YEAR -- IT DID GET TO THE GOVERNOR HE DID EXPRESS SOME CONCERNS AND I THINK THAT HAS -- IT ENGENDERED SOME ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS THAT I THINK ARE LEGITIMATE -- BUT I'M NOT BUT I DON'T THINK THAT'S WHAT YOU WERE ANTICIPATING TO BE A PROBLEM SO IF WE COULD PERHAPS I'M GONNA ALLOW A COMMENT FROM THE CHAMBER AND THEN FROM YOU AND THEN WORK. WITH YOUR SOME. THE WILLINGNESS WILL. PUT THIS OVER PERHAPS A WEEK AND WILL TRY TO CLEAN THIS UP BECAUSE I THINK WE'RE ALL. THE A LITTLE UNSURE OF WHAT THIS YOU. SHOULD LOOK LIKE EVEN THOUGH I KNOW. WHERE YOU WANT TO GO WITH THIS SO IF YOU'D LIKE TO MAKE A COMMENT? AND THEN WILL CLOSE WITH YOU SIR AND AND THEN WE'LL MOVE ON ABSOLUTELY A JUST OUTLOOK I WANT TO HAVE THE CHAMBER. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR TO CENTER WHITE HOUSE HE'S POINT I WANTED TO POINT OUT ALSO THAT UNLIKE THE ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE WHERE WE CANNOT ASSERT. THAT OUR CLIENTS CANNOT DISCLOSE THE COMMUNICATIONS THAT WE HAVE WITH THEM HERE IN THIS BILL THE CONTEMPLATION IS THAT EITHER PARTY CAN PROHIBIT THE OTHER PARTY FROM DISCLOSING THOSE CONVERSATIONS WITH ANOTHER CONCERN THAT WE SHOULD ADDRESS AS WE MOVE FORWARD [inaudible] OF RESPONSE. F. F. AS DAUGHTER POINTED OUT CERTAINLY WILLING TO WORK WITH THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE -- TO TIGHTEN THE LANUAGE ON THIS. THE IDEA IS UNIQUE BECAUSE THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING FRAMEWORK IS UNIQUE THE DUTY OF FAIR REPRESENTATION IS A IS A DOCTRINE THAT WE AS UNIONS HAVE TO HEAR TO THAT ATTORNEYS DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE. TO TO IT HERE TOO NOR DO ANY OTHER TYPES OF ALLEGES THAT HAVE BEEN -- GRANTED TO OTHER DIFFERENT CLASSIFICATIONS OR OR FAMILY MEMBERS OF LITIGANTS. YOU KNOW SO THIS IS A UNIQUE ISSUE CERTAINLY WILLING TO WORK WITH FOLKS BUT PART OF THE PROBLEM IS THAT. IT IN A SITUATION WHERE YOU HAVE SOMEONE IN A DEALING WITH A GAL WORKPLACE INVESTIGATION. IF A UNION ARE IS REPRESENTING ALL OF THE MEMBERS OF THE BARGAINING UNIT ONE MEMBER WANTS TO DISCLOSE INFORMATION OR AS WELL OKAY WITH. PRIVILEGE THAT APPLIES TO A CERTAIN ISSUE BUT IT HAS A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON EVERYONE ELSE IN THE BARGAINING UNIT. WE ARE ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR DEALING WITH THE AFTER EFFECTS OF THAT THAT'S A PRETTY UNIQUE. SITUATION THAT ISN'T CONSIDERED WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THE OTHER PRIVILEGES THAT HAVE BEEN GRANTED BY TWENTY SIX THAT YOU THINK UBER YOU AGREED I THINK THAT'S WHY WE NEED TO TIGHTEN THIS UP S THATWE RECOGNIZE THE UNIQUE NATURE OF THIS COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT. BUT ALSO PUT IN THE CONTEXT THAT MAKES SENSE. AS IT RELATES TO THE OTHER PRIVILEGES THAT EXISTS SO WITH THAT. IF WE COULD THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR TIME THINK THIS WAS A HELP A VERY HELPFUL DISCUSSION AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU TO GET THAT. CLARIFIED THANKS [inaudible] FOR PUBLICLY. IS ASSEMBLY MEMBER TING HERE BECAUSE I KNOW HE'S GOT OTHER THINGS THAT ARE A LITTLE BIT ON HIS MIND.
