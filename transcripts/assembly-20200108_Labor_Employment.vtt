CONVERSATION ABOUT SUCH AN

00:39:03.140 --> 00:39:05.710
IMPORTANT AND TIMELY ISSUE. AND

CONCERNS WITH THE AMENDED

00:40:32.863 --> 00:40:35.366

IN CALIFORNIA IS DIFFERENT THAN

00:40:43.574 --> 00:40:45.910
THAT AND FEDERAL LAW. SO THAT'S

00:40:45.976 --> 00:40:46.644

ALL OF THE LANGUAGE FROM THE

00:41:10.601 --> 00:41:11.268
EIGHTY A WOULD BE ABLE TO BE

00:41:11.335 --> 00:41:13.103

ALREADY IN THE LAW WE FEEL THAT

00:41:22.213 --> 00:41:24.915
THIS IS A LITTLE BIT TO LOOK AT

00:41:24.982 --> 00:41:26.183
IT BUT IF IT'S GOING TO- IT

00:41:26.250 --> 00:41:26.951
TAKE ON THE FEDERAL PROVISIONS

00:41:27.017 --> 00:41:28.485

INDIVIDUALS- THAT GET THAT

00:44:50.287 --> 00:44:52.489
RETURN TO THE WORKPLACE I DON'T

00:44:52.556 --> 00:44:54.391
KNOW ABOUT THIS DRUG AND WHAT

00:45:09.373 --> 00:45:14.011
CONCERN. ABOUT. EVEN JUST DRUG

00:45:14.078 --> 00:45:15.779
TESTING IF YOU STILL NEED. A

00:45:15.846 --> 00:45:16.680

00:45:16.747 --> 00:45:18.048
CONSTRUCTION SITES WE STILL

00:45:18.115 --> 00:45:18.782
NEED TO DO IT EVEN IF SOMEONE

00:45:18.849 --> 00:45:20.250
WAS OFF. OF A CERTAIN DRUG AND

00:45:20.317 --> 00:45:22.386
HAD REHABILITATED CONCEIVE LA

00:45:22.453 --> 00:45:23.954

00:45:27.257 --> 00:45:28.659
GAVE THOSE CHANCES TO

00:45:28.725 --> 00:45:30.694
REHABILITATE. BUT ONCE YOU GOT

00:45:30.761 --> 00:45:32.696

IN THE FIELD YOU START WORKING

00:45:38.669 --> 00:45:41.171
WITH HEAVY. DUTY MACHINERY IT

00:45:41.238 --> 00:45:43.841
WAS REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT-

00:45:43.907 --> 00:45:46.110
THAT YOU WERE CLEAR HEADED AND

PANEL AND HOPE WOULD BUILD MY

00:51:13.703 --> 00:51:14.638
WITNESS. COMMERCIAL PAINTER HIS

00:51:14.704 --> 00:51:16.440
NAME WAS STEVE. AND HE SAID

00:51:16.506 --> 00:51:17.908
THAT HE BECAME ADDICTED. TO

00:51:17.974 --> 00:51:26.983
PAIN. KILLERS AND HE WAS CASE

00:51:27.050 --> 00:51:31.855
IN IT HI UP TIME THE GUY. LIKE

00:51:31.922 --> 00:51:33.723
IT'S KIND OF A C<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt; AS I HIGH.&lt;/c&gt;</u>

00:51:33.790 --> 00:51:36.293
THE LAST FEW YEARS WE'VE SEEN

00:51:36.359 --> 00:51:38.662
THIS NEW DRUG THIS AND MAKE

00:51:38.728 --> 00:51:41.832
TEA. BEEPING AFFERENTS A BOX ON

00:51:41.898 --> 00:51:42.866
WHAT THE OTHER ONE THAT. NO

00:51:42.933 --> 00:51:44.768
TRACKS IN. A SHOW THAT HAS

00:51:44.835 --> 00:51:45.602
LOWER LEVELS AND THE

00:51:45.669 --> 00:51:48.104
INDIVIDUALS. DON'T GET HOT IT'S

00:51:48.171 --> 00:51:48.805
THE THING THAT THAT THE GUY

00:51:48.872 --> 00:51:50.040
WANTED TO DO EVERYDAY AS WAKE

00:51:50.106 --> 00:51:51.975
UP AND BE FUNCTIONING. GO TO

00:51:52.042 --> 00:51:53.810
WORK AND THE INDIVIDUAL. WORK

00:51:53.877 --> 00:51:56.246
FOR A COMMERCIAL PAINTER IT WAS

00:51:56.313 --> 00:51:58.582
A CONSTRUCTION WORKER HE'S HE

00:51:58.648 --> 00:51:59.749
HE HE A SHELL LIKE MANY PEOPLE

00:51:59.816 --> 00:52:01.685
MINISTRY OF THIS. NOT IS IN THE

00:52:01.751 --> 00:52:02.719
SAY IT'S A WONDER DRUG BUT IT'S

00:52:02.786 --> 00:52:04.154
ONE OF THE- GREAT TREAT

00:52:04.221 --> 00:52:05.922
PROMISING TREATMENTS WE HAVE

00:52:05.989 --> 00:52:06.490
ACROSS THE COUNTRY A LOT OF

00:52:06.556 --> 00:52:08.525
PEOPLE TO GET BACK. INTO

00:52:08.592 --> 00:52:09.593
SOCIETY GET BACK TO WORK AND

00:52:09.659 --> 00:52:10.594
THAT'S WHAT WE ARE ALL ABOUT SO

00:52:10.660 --> 00:52:12.829
I THINK THAT THERE. IS A SWEET

00:52:12.896 --> 00:52:14.464
SPOT THAT WE CAN WORK OUT WITH

00:52:14.531 --> 00:52:19.970
WITH THE- THE KID THE

00:52:20.036 --> 00:52:20.537
OPPOSITION AND THAT CONCERN

00:52:20.604 --> 00:52:24.074
OURS. NOT REALLY WORK CONCERNS

00:52:24.140 --> 00:52:26.309
BUT I'M- AND THEN THAT'S OF

00:52:26.376 --> 00:52:27.277
COURSE WITH THE- THE COMMITTEE

00:52:27.344 --> 00:52:28.778
AS WELL. AND I APPRECIATE THAT

00:52:28.845 --> 00:52:31.248
AND I THINK- THIS IS NOW I

00:52:31.314 --> 00:52:32.716
THINK THAT THE DEGREE NOT ONLY

00:52:32.782 --> 00:52:33.350
OF THE OPIOID CRISIS WHICH IS

00:52:33.416 --> 00:52:34.751
BEEN- TAKEN MANY YEARS TO GET

00:52:34.818 --> 00:52:36.686
US WHERE WE ARE BUT- THESE NEW

00:52:36.753 --> 00:52:38.121
TREATMENTS AND I THINK THAT-

00:52:38.188 --> 00:52:39.789
EMPLOYERS- THAT IS A SUMMARY

00:52:39.856 --> 00:52:40.457
JONES SAWYER SAID HAVING.

00:52:40.524 --> 00:52:42.626
WORKED IN THAT ARENA- THEIR

00:52:42.692 --> 00:52:43.727
NUMBER ONE PRIORITY IS SAFETY

00:52:43.793 --> 00:52:45.262
AND SOMETHING IF YOU'RE

00:52:45.328 --> 00:52:47.230
INTRODUCING SOMETHING NEW- TO A

00:52:47.297 --> 00:52:49.699
WORK SITE WHETHER TO MEDICATION

00:52:49.766 --> 00:52:51.401
OR TREATMENT WHAT HAVE YOU-

00:52:51.468 --> 00:52:53.737
IT'S A COMMON UPON THEM. DID TO

00:52:53.803 --> 00:52:55.138
DO THEIR DUE DILIGENCE TO

00:52:55.205 --> 00:52:55.939
CONTINUE TO MAKE SURE THEY HAVE

00:52:56.006 --> 00:52:57.073
A SAFER EXCITE. AND THAT'S WHY

00:52:57.140 --> 00:52:58.241
I THINK THE DIALOGUE AS TO WHAT

00:52:58.308 --> 00:52:59.943
THESE TREATMENTS ARE WHAT THEY

00:53:00.010 --> 00:53:01.845
DO WHAT THEY'RE PURPOSES. AND

00:53:01.912 --> 00:53:03.446
FINDING WAYS TO NARROW. THE

00:53:03.513 --> 00:53:04.915
FOCUS OF THE BILL AS MUCH AND

00:53:04.981 --> 00:53:07.217
IT ALREADY HAS AS YOU

00:53:07.284 --> 00:53:08.785
INDICATED- YOUR YOUR INTEREST

00:53:08.852 --> 00:53:10.754
IN CLARIFYING IT BROTHER DOES

00:53:10.820 --> 00:53:12.789
THAT. BUT I THINK THAT THE AYE

00:53:12.856 --> 00:53:13.790
AYES WHENEVER YOU'RE DOING

00:53:13.857 --> 00:53:14.658
SOMETHING NEW ESPECIALLY IN

00:53:14.724 --> 00:53:16.426
WHEN THEY CUT DEALS WITH.

00:53:16.493 --> 00:53:24.100
SOMETHING SO SIGNIFICANT AS.

00:53:24.167 --> 00:53:24.701
OPIATE ADDICTION. AND WORK. IF

00:53:24.768 --> 00:53:30.106
THE. TWO ISSUES THAT. DON'T

00:53:30.173 --> 00:53:32.509
WANT TO. RISE UP THAT DOESN'T

00:53:32.576 --> 00:53:33.843
REQUIRE. EDUCATION DIALOGUE.

00:53:33.910 --> 00:53:36.212
AND I DO THINK THAT THERE IS. A

00:53:36.279 --> 00:53:37.147
IN THE MIND TO BE HAD I THINK

00:53:37.213 --> 00:53:38.615
IT'S A PRETTY NARROW. NEEDLE TO

00:53:38.682 --> 00:53:39.649

00:53:44.988 --> 00:53:45.522
THAT MOVED TO STOP FOR A GIVEN

00:53:45.589 --> 00:53:51.027
THAT OPPORTUNITY. I AM A NDA

00:53:51.094 --> 00:53:53.930
THE ALSO. OKAY ABOUT THAT

00:53:53.997 --> 00:53:56.299
AMOUNT OF SECTOR IF WE CAN.

00:53:56.366 --> 00:53:56.900
CALL THE CALL THE ROLL ON THE

00:53:56.967 --> 00:54:00.604
