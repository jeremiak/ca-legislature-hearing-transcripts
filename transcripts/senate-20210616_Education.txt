ON JULY TWENTY SEVENTEEN A WOMAN DIED AFTER SHE FELL HUNDRED FIFTY FEET FROM A SEASIDE BLUFF IN SANTA CRUZ COUNTY WHEN THE GROUND BENEATH HER CRUMBLED THE CLIFF IN BATTERED BY WINTER STORMS AND COLLAPSED. ON FEBRUARY TWENTY NINETEEN SAN FRANCISCO A WOMAN A DOG WERE RESCUED ANOTHER WOMAN REMAIN TRAPPED AFTER THE EDGE OF A CLIFF COLLAPSED ON TOP OF THEM BEARING ONE VICTIM UNDER TONS OF DIRT. THE TRUMP WOMAN'S BODY WAS NEVER RECOVERED. AUGUST TWENTY NINETEEN IN MY OWN DISTRICT DOWN THE STREET FROM ME THREE PEOPLE WERE FATALLY CRUSHED WHEN A BLUFF COLLAPSED IN CITIES BEACH IN MY HOMETOWN THE VICTIMS ARE PART OF A LARGE FAMILY GATHERING THAT DAY. AND HOW THE BLUFF COLLAPSE A FEW SECONDS EARLIER. THE DEATH TOLL WOULD HAVE INCLUDED CHILDREN. AND ADDITION TO PUBLIC CAN. ERODING CLIFFS THREATENED EXTENSIVE CLIFFTOP DEVELOPMENT THROUGHOUT THE STATE INCLUDING HIGHWAYS RAILWAYS. WELL WASTE WATER OIL NATURAL GAS AND NUCLEAR FACILITIES UNIVERSITY SEVERAL CRITICAL MILITARY BASES. AND NO MORE STATE PARKS AND BEACHES. RECENT BLOOD FAILURES IN THE CITY OF DEL MAR IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY THREATEN THE LOS AND QUARTER REAL. THE REAL WAY THAT HAVE RESULTED IN MULTIPLE CLOSURES OF THE SECOND BUSIEST RECORDER IN THE COUNTRY IMPACTING COMMUTERS FOR TRANSPORT AND THE PORT OF SAN DIEGO AND THE STATE'S EONOMY. WHAT IS MISSING RIGHT NOW AS OUR UNDERSTANDING OF SCIENCE ARAMBULA FAILURES I UNDERSTAND THE PROCESS THAT DRIVES BLOOD FOR YOU YEARS NOT A LONG TERM PROCESS BUT THE IMMEDIATE WHEN CAN WE PREDICT WHEN THEY'RE GOING TO HAPPEN. BECAUSE IF YOU'RE AT THE BLEAK BEACH AND YOU'RE STANDING IN FRONT OF US IN ITS TEN SECONDS TO RUN INTO THE OCEAN YOU NEED SO LITTLE TIME AND WE'VE DONE THIS WITH EARTHQUAKES NOW I WANT TO DO THIS WITH MY FINGERS- WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE- IN THE CAR.

THANK YOU SURE LEYVA AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND THANKS TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER BOERNER HORVATH FOR INTRODUCING THIS BILL WE THINK IT CAN SIGNIFICANTLY ADVANCE RESEARCH ON THE DYNAMICS OF CLIFF COLLAPSE ALONG CALIFORNIA'S COAST LINES. MY COLLEAGUES GROUPS DR ADAM YOUNG WILL FUNDING FROM THE STATE PARKS OCEANOGRAPHY PROGRAM. HAS BEEN SERVING THE CLIFFS BETWEEN SAN DIEGO ON CEAN SIDE FOR SEVERAL YEARS USING LIDAR LIDAR IS THE SYSTEM THAT SCANS THE CLIFFS WITH THE LASER. CREATING A HIGHLY DETAILED SPATIAL MAPS WITH RESOLUTION MEASURED IN INCHES. THIS LETS US LEARN WHERE AND HOW OFTEN CLIP FAILURES OCCUR. DETECTING THE SMALL HARDLY NOTICEABLE ROCK FALLS ALL THE WAY TO THE MAJOR COLLAPSES WHICH THREATEN LIVES AND PROPERTY. WELL CALIFORNIA'S COASTLINES. WITH FUNDING FROM THIS BILL WE WOULD AIM TO GET A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE PROCESSES LEADING UP THE CLIFF FAILURES. BY DOING TWO THINGS FIRST WE WILL ACCELERATE THE COLLECTION OF THE SLIDE ARDAYDA. ALLOWING FOR MORE FREQUENT AND BETTER RESOLUTION SCANS OF THE CLIPS AND THEN ASSIMILATE THESE MEASUREMENTS INTO A GROWING HISTORICAL DATABASE TO LEARN WHERE AND WHEN FAILURES HAVE OCCURRED IN THE PAST AND WHERE THEY ARE MOST LIKELY TO OCCUR IN THE FUTURE. NO KEY GOAL IS TO FIND OUT IF ANY SIGNATURE EXISTS THAT COULD FORETELL OF HEIGHTENED RISK IN SPECIFIC LOCATIONS. SECONDLY WE WOULD INSTRUMENT KEY SITES WITH GEOTECHNICAL MONITORING TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPED CHURCH GROUPS IN THE PAST FEW YEARS. THAT CAN DETECT INFINITESIMAL THE FORMATIONS OF THE ROCKS. THESE ARE TECHNOLOGIES THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE UNTIL THE PAST FEW YEARS. AGAIN OUR GOAL IS TO LEARN HOW THE FORMATIONS ARE IMPACTED BY TIDES LARGE SERVE GROUNDWATER AND RAINFALL TO SEE IF WE CAN ANSWER THIS QUESTION OF WHETHER SIGNALS EXIST THAT CAN FORECAST WHERE AND WHEN. AN INCREASED RISK FOR COLLAPSE IS DEVELOPING.

ALL RIGHT WE ARE NOW MOVING TO OUR SECOND ITEM WHICH IS AB TWO FORTY FIVE WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER TO. ONCE WE ARE READY. FOR YOU PLEASE BEGIN WHEN YOU ARE READY. ASSEMBLY MEMBER MORNING MADAM CHAIR SENATORS- PREACHING YOUR CONSIDERATION OF AB TWO FORTY FIVE. TRANSGENDER NON BINARY STUDENTS FACE MANY BARRIERS AT SCHOOL AND IN THE WORKPLACE AND WE KNOW THAT IF A STUDENT DOESN'T HAVE AN UPDATED DIPLOMA OR TRANSCRIPT THEY CAN FACE CHALLENGES APPLYING FOR GRADUATE SCHOOL OR EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES. A COLLEGE DIPLOMA IS A REPRESENTATION OF YEARS OF HARD WORK AND ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT WHICH SHOULDN'T% CAUSE STRESS BY HAVING SOMEONE THAT NAME ON IT. THE DIPLOMA THAT HAS THE WRONG NAME ON IT CAN HAVE THE IMPACT OF OUTING SOMEONE WHO DOES NOT WISH TO BE OUTED OR MAY FEEL UNSAFE IN THEIR CURRENT SITUATION THIS BILL DOES TWO THINGS IT ALLOWS TRANSGENDER AND NON BINARY STUDENTS AT PUBLIC COLLEGES. TO HAVE THEIR CHOSEN NAME PRINTED ON THEIR DIPLOMA WHEN THEY GRADUATE AND SECONDLY IT CREATES A STANDARD PROCESS FOR UPDATING STUDENT RECORDS OF FORMER STUDENTS SO THAT THEIR NAME AND GENDER ARE ACCURATELY REFLECTED ON IMPORTANT RECORDS. THIS BILL THIS BUILDS ON THE AB SEVEN ELEVEN LAW SIGNED IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TO MAKE SURE THAT FORMER K. THROUGH TWELVE STUDENTS ARE ABLE TO UPDATE THEIR STUDENT RECORDS WE HEARD FROM COLLEGE STUDENTS FACING SIMILAR CHARGES AND SO I NEED TO EXTEND THIS POLICY. TRANSLITERATE FOLKS FACE LOTS OF BARRIERS THE NAME OF THE DIPLOMA SHOULD NOT BE ANOTHER THING THAT THEY WORRY ABOUT. AND WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO TURN IT OVER TO OUR MAIN WITNESS. ARE JOINED BY TIMMY MARTINTHE LEGISLATIVE MANAGER FOR EQUALITY CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU SIMPLY MEMBER. MS MARTIN ARE YOU ON THE LINE. I AM GOOD MORNING SHARING COMMITTEE MEMBERS ATTENDING MARTIN ON BEHALF OF EQUALITY CALIFORNIA. WE'RE PROUD TO BE HERE TODAY AS A CO SPONSOR OF EIGHTY TWO FORTY FIVE. WHICH IS THE AUTHOR MENTIONED WILL ENSURE THAT FORMER STUDENTS WILL BE ABLE TO OBTAIN ACADEMIC RECORDS THAT ACCURATELY REFLECTS THEIR LEGAL NAME AND GENDER. REGARDLESS OF WHEN THEY GRADUATED. IT ALSO QUITE SPECIFIED SENATE GRADUATING STUDENT MAY EASILY HAVE THEIR CHOSEN NAME LISTED ON THEIR DIPLOMA. WHICH IS THE CEREMONIAL BUT STILL PERSONALLY SIGNIFICANT DOCUMENT. AND WHEN AN ACCURATE INACCURATE DOCUMENT PUT TRANSGENDER AND NON BINARY STUDENTS AT RISK OF DISCRIMINATION AND HARM. WHEN THEY USE FOR EXAMPLE A TRANSCRIPT YOU APPLY FOR JOBS OR OTHER OPPORTUNITIES. AS THE AUTHOR HAD MENTIONED AND THEREBY COMPOUNDING THE VITAL BARRIERS. TO EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING THAT LGBTQ PLUS PEOPLE ALREADY FACE. DOES NOT COMMONSENSE BILL IT WILL ADDRESS INEQUITY THAT WORK BASED GUARD THE PRIVACY OF ALL GRADUATES INCLUDING TRANSGENDER AND NON BINARY RATCHET. AND ENSURE THE EDUCATIONAL. RECORDS ARE ACCURATE. RECALL TO A FAMILY CHIU WHO BEING AND SHE- FOR THE L. G. B. PLUS COMMUNITY. OFFERING EIGHTY TWO BY. WE ARE GRATEFUL FOR BECAUSE- THAT WOULD KIND OF GOVERNOR.

THERE IS NO ONE WHO IS SIGNALED THAT THEY WISH TO SPEAK VERY GOOD THANK YOU MR MODERATOR WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE TO HAVE ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS OR CONCERNS SENATOR PAM. I THANK YOU AND A SUMMER TO APPRECIATE YOU BRING THIS BILL FOR IT INSTANTLY VERY STRONGLY SUPPORT THE INTENT OF THE BILL AND THE PURPOSE OF THE BILL. I DID I DID JUST HAVE A BRIEF QUESTION DOES IT- AND- SINCE I WAS LOOKING AT SOME OF THE DOCUMENTS AND SO FORTH- WE CERTAINLY WANT TO MAKE. SO THIS IS REALLY ABOUT THE CHANGE IN NAME ON TRANSCRIPTS MOVING FORWARD AGAIN I THINK THAT WE NEED TO MAKE IT- STRAIGHT FORWARD AND SIMPLE FOR PEOPLE TO DO THAT WHO- TRANS AND- AND TO REFLECT THEIR IDENTITY- THE ONE. THE AREA OF CONCERN I. HAVE AND MAYBE IT'S ALREADY BEN ADDRESSED IS THAT. THESE TRANSCRIPTS ARE ALSO USED TO OFFER THINGS LIKE LICENSING AND SO FORTH AND SO I UNDERSTAND SOMEONE WHO'S TRANSGENDER. BUT DOES THIS BILL ALLOW SOMEONE WHO ISN'T THAT LET'S SAY JUST CHANGING FROM. PHYSICAL WE DON'T WANT IS SOMEONE CHANGE GOING BACK CHANGING A TRANSCRIPT TO ACTUALLY MAY BE THE SAME GENDER AND GENDER NAMES BUT THE PURPOSE OF. FRAUD IN ORDER FOR THEM TO TRY TO LET'S SAY INAPPROPRIATELY SECURE A LICENSE AND USE THAT AS EVIDENCE THAT DAY GRADUATED FROM. A CERTAIN SCHOOL OR SOMETHING AND SO THE HACK SOMEONE'S NAME FIND IT FIND A WAY TO CHANGE THEIR NAME AND THEN SAY HERE HERE'S MY TRANSCRIPT I GRADUATE FROM THIS PROFESSIONAL SCHOOL LABOR AND- PLEASE GIVE ME OF LICENSE SO. I JUST WANT TO MS OF SECURITY IT IS THE UNDERSTAND THAT THIS BILL DOES THIS BILL ACTUALLY RESTRICT THE NAME CHANGE TO PEOPLE CHANGE WHO WHO- TRANS GENDER. OR GENDER IDENTITY DIFFERENT VERSES- SOMEONE WHO JUST SIMPLY WANT TO CHANGE THE NAME AND READ. CHANGE THE NAME OF YOUR TRANSCRIPTS- AND- I REALIZE THAT ALSO BY THE WAY A LOT OF PEOPLE DO CHANGE NAMES. OTHER REASONS AS WELL SO. I HAVE TO ADMIT IS THE FOR TIME I'VE BEEN. THAT QUESTION- I THINK TALKING BY TWO SEPARATE THINGS ABI- TALKING ABOUT INDIVIDUALS WHO WISH TO CHANGE THEIR NAME FROM A FORMER DEBT NAME. SO ASSUMING THEY ARE THAT INDIVIDUAL THERE IS NO EXAMPLE OF FRAUD I SUSPECT WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. NO OBVIOUSLY FRAUD IS ON OUR MINDS BECAUSE WE'RE SEEING THAT A LOT OF CONTACTS AND- IN IF SOMEONE WERE TO TRY TO IMPERSONATE ANOTHER COLLEGE STUDENT AND GET A TRANSCRIPT. IN MY MIND THAT IS A DIFFERENT SET OF ISSUES AND WE'RE TRYING TO SOLVE HERE- PROBABLY A DIFFERENCE OF THE BILL'S DIFFERENT SORT OF POLICIES. I'M ASSUMING THAT OUR PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES. HAVE SAFEGUARDS IN PLACE TO MAKE SURE THAT- THAT THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN BUT HAPPY TO ASK MORE ABOUT WHAT THE STATE COURTS ARE TO ENSURE THAT- THAT SOMEONE CAN'T COME IN PERSON BECAUSE I SUSPECT THAT- IF THAT CAN HAPPEN. WHEN THE SITUATION CAN HAPPEN IN MANY SITUATIONS SOME COULD SAY- YOU KNOW I'M RICHARD PAN I GRADUATED FROM THIS UNIVERSITY EVEN THOUGH I'M NOT RICHARD PAN. SO I'M HAPPY TO LOOK INTO THAT BUT I DO SUSPECT IT'S A IT'S A BROADER ISSUE THAN WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO. WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS HERE. CORRECT AND NOTIFY IT'S THE SENATE PLAN IF I MAY. IF THE BILL GETS OUT OF COMMITTEE IS HEADED TO JUDICIARY WHICH I THINK MIGHT BE THEIR PURVIEW AND THEY MAY HAVE SOME. ANSWERS FOR YOU THERE HE WAS UNDERGOING ON THAT. SO I GUESS. AND I STRONGLY SUPPORT THAT WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO AND YES PEOPLE SHOULD BE ABLE TO CHANGE SO THAT THEIR DAD NAME DOESN'T SHOW UP ON THE TRANSCRIPT. I FULLY AGREE WITH THAT IN FACT- WHAT WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL. I JUST WANT TO. BE SURE WE LOOK AT THIS OTHER ISSUE- TO BE STRIPPED AND JUST. SO SURE THAT WHAT WERE. THE LANGUAGE IN THIS BILL WHICH INVOLVES CHANGING NAMES. IS THAT IT WOULD PROVIDE SUFFICIENT SECURITY SO THAT WE DON'T CREATE AN OPENING FOR- THE PERSON ATION ARE FRIED SO. IN TERMS OF LIKE THE DOCUMENTATION WHAT DOCUMENTATION YOU TO PROVIDE NOR TO CHANGE THE NAME AT CETERA- SO. CERTAINLY HOPE LEAVE THAT CAN BE ADDRESSED AND- JUDICIARY COMMITTEE- BUT I JUST WANT TO. BE SURE THAT WE'RE COVERING. THAT ISSUE I KNOW THAT'S NOT INTENDED TO THIS BILL THAT'S NOT PURPOSE OF THIS- IT'S JUST DOWN JUST WANNA BE SURE WE CAN. THAT BASED. SOMETHING YOU AND- SENATE. TO MOVE BILL TO PRO TIME THANK YOU WILL CERTAIN. ASK THE VERY. WE THE PROTECT AREN'T. AROUND THE IN GENERAL. THANK YOU CENTER PANTS UNDER GLAZER.

WELCOME ASSEMBLY MEMBER GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS I WANNA BEGIN BY ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS AS PROPOSED BY THE COMMITTEE. CALIFORNIA CURRENTLY HAS THE HIGHEST POPULATION OF MILITARY PERSONNEL AND SAN DIEGO IS HOME TO MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACTIVE DUTY NAVY AND MARINE CORPS SERVICE MEMBERS. SERVICE MEMBERS OFTEN TURN TO CALIFORNIA'S COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM TO PURSUE HIGHER EDUCATION OR JOB TRAINING PROGRAMS. IN AN EFFORT TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO MILITARY MEMBERS COMMUNITY COLLEGES HAVE OFFERED COURSES HOSTED ON MILITARY BASES. HOWEVER IN RECENT YEARS INCREASE SECURITY SCREENING HAS GREATLY REDUCED ACCESS TO THESE CLASSES FOR STUDENTS NOT LIVING ON BASE. AND AS A RESULT MANY CLASSES HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY CLOSED TO THE PUBLIC. BECAUSE CURRENT LAW DOES NOT ALLOW COMMUNITY COLLEGES. TO COLLECT APARTMENTS FOR CLASSES THAT ARE CLOSED TO THE PUBLIC THIS IS EFFECTIVELY LIMITED THE COURSE OFFERINGS AVAILABLE TO SERVICE MEMBERS. AB FIVE SEVEN SIX WOULD WAIVE THE OPEN COURSE PROVISIONS FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGE CLASSES PROVIDED TO ACTIVE DUTY MILITARY PERSONNEL ON MILITARY BASES. THIS WOULD AUTHORIZE THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS TO INCLUDE THE UNITS OF FULL TIME EQUIVALENT STUDENTS GENERATED IN THOSE CLASSES. FOR PURPOSES OF STATE APPORTIONMENT THIS BILL AIMS TO ENSURE MILITARY SERVICE MEMBERS AND THEIR FAMILIES HAVE ACCESS TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE COURSES. THEY MAY NOT OTHERWISE BE ABLE TO ACCESS TO THE WORK SCHEDULES FAMILY COMMITMENTS AND SERVICE REQUIREMENTS. WITH ME TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT IS MARK MCDONALD WAS SAN DIEGO COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT.

AND I WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT WE SUPPORT WE VERY MUCH SUPPORT THE GOAL OF THE BILL WHICH IS TO AFFORD IT AND GREATER OPPORTUNITY TO BE INVOLVED IN THE GOVERNANCE OF THEIR SCHOOL. AND IN FACT MANY CHARTER SCHOOLS REPORT THAT THEY HAVE EXISTING PROCESS USED IN PLACE TO ENSURE STUDENTS HAVE MEANINGFUL PARTICIPATION IN SCHOOL GOVERNANCE- HOWEVER CHARTER SHOOLS ARE UNIQUE AND- AT NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION AND ARE SUBJECT TO SOME DIFFERENT LAWS SUCH AS THE CORPORATIONS CODE. IN SCHOOL DISTRICTS FOR GOVERNANCE AND OPERATION. AND AS SUCH WE RECOMMENDED AMENDMENTS TO THE AUTHOR FIRST THE MODIFICATIONS TO THE BILL TO MAKE IT WORKABLE AND EFFECTIVE. WITH REGARD TO CHARTER SCHOOLS. OF PARA CAN TO CEASE. IS A SUGGEST AMENDMENT WE MADE IT CLEAR THAT YOU DO OF A- WORKMAN. DOES NOT. A MATERIAL REVIEW OF THE CHARTER UNDER THE CHARTER SCHOOL BOX OF MATERIAL REVISION TO A SCHOOL CHARTER MUST BE SUBMITTED AND APPROVED BY THE CHARTER SCHOOL AUTHORIZER. THIS IS A PROCESS THAT MAY TAKE AN EXTENSIVE AMOUNT OF TIME AND IT SOMETIMES BECAUSE FOR VOCAL BUTTE. THEREFORE WE FEEL CLARITY IS NEEDED TO ENSURE THAT IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NEW LAW DOES NOT REQUIRE SCHOOL JUDICIARY THE FORMAL MATERIAL REVISION PROCESS. ABSENCES CLARITY STUDENT PARTICIPATION COULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY DELAYED OR EVEN WORSE IF AN OPERATOR-FAILS TO RESPOND TO THE MATERIAL REVISION. IN PARTICIPATION WOULD BE SUSPENDED NEITHER OF THESE OUTCOMES WOULD FURTHER THE INTENT OF THE STEALTH SO THEREFORE WE ARE RESPECTFULLY REQUESTING THAT YOU ONLY APPROVED THE MEASURE WHICH AMENDMENTS NECESSARY TO ENSURE TECHNICAL ACCURACY.

SOME CONCERNS ARE YOU ARE YOU GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE CHARTER SCHOOLS TO TRY TO GET THERE A SUPPORT I KNOW THAT THEIR- AMENDMENTS SEEM TO BE. SOMEWHAT SIMPLE. RIGHT I CERTAINLY WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH OF THE CHARTER SCHOOLS I DO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT. THE COMMITTED TO THE COMMITTEE STAFF HAS WORKED WITH US AND WE'VE BEEN AWARE OF THIS- PARTICULAR CONCERN WE BELIEVE WE HAVE ADDRESSED IT- THEN I HOPE THAT THIS IS SIMPLY A MISUNDERSTANDING. A NUMBER ONE WE'VE EMPHASIZED THAT THE- STUDENT AS A NON VOTING MEMBER- TO PROTECT THEMSELVES FROM THE- THE LEGISLATION THAT- REQUIRES THAT OF THESE ENTITIES NON PROFIT ENTITIES NOT HAVE NON VOTING- MAY NOT ELECTED MEMBERSHIP HIM VOTING. ALSO SPECIFICALLY- WE BELIEVE THE BILL IS NOT A MATERIAL REVISION- TO- THE CHARTER SCHOOL AMENDMENT- THE BILL ONLY REQUIRES THAT THE STUDENT MEMBERS LISTED AS PART OF THE CHARTER DURING THE NEXT CHARTER RENEWAL. AND THIS BILL STATES THAT- TO INCLUDE AT THE NEXT CHARTER RENEWAL WITH THE CHARTERING AUTHORITY TO INCLUSION OF PEOPLE MEMBER AS A CHANGE TO THE GOVERNING BODY OF THE- OF THE CHARTER SCHOOL. IN THE MEANTIME ALSO CHARTER SCHOOL HAS TO DO IS PROVIDE A WRITTEN NOTICE WITHIN THIRTY DAYS- TO WHAT'S AUTHORIZERS. SO WORKING WITH COMMITTEE STAFF AT AND MY STAFF WE BELIEVE WE'VE ADDRESSED THAT CONCERN- BUT WE WILL CONTINUE CONVERSATIONS AND HOPES THAT- WHATEVER MISUNDERSTANDING WE HAVE THEIR- BUT ARE JUST NOT OUR INTENTION TO. HAVE THIS REQUEST WHICH I WOULD POINT OUT CAME FROM STUDENT BODY ORGANIZATIONS AROUND- CALIFORNIA AND I WANT TO RIGHT NOW PUBLICLY ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THIS IS THERE. A LEGISLATION THAT THEY CAME TO US WITH- AND- THE- I THINK VERY MUCH BELIEVE IN IN THIS LEGISLATION SO WE'VE TRIED TO ADDRESS ALL. THE CONCERNS WE HAVE NO INTENTION OF TRYING TO THROW AWAY LEGAL HARD HURDLE- AT CHARTER SCHOOLS IS A GO FOR. THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR CENTER GLAZER. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER- WELCOME TO THE WELCOME SENATE YOU'RE ENJOYING YEARS OF- I- IN GENERAL TERM I VERY MUCH SUPPORT YOU KNOW STUDENT REPRESENTATION IN FACT HAVE A BILL THAT A SECOND VOTING STUDENT REGENT TO THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AND IT SERVED AS A TRUSTEE OF THE STATE UNIVERSITIES WITH THE STUDENT. TRUSTEE ONE VOTING ONE NOT THAT WERE PROVIDED WONDERFUL ENRICHMENT TO OUR DISCUSSIONS I WAS A LITTLE CONFUSED AND- AND A COUPLE PLACES ONE IS I DIDN'T SEE THE SUIT ORGANIZATIONS LISTED AS SPONSORS YOU PENSION THEN WHAT WHAT'S THE ACTUAL FORMAL NAME OF THE GROUP THAT SPONSORING THE BILL THEN WELL IT WAS A IT WAS A VARIETY OF STUDENT ORGANIZATIONS THAT CAME TOGETHER CALIFORNIA STUDENT SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER SCHOOL BOARD ASSOCIATION- GENERATION UP. ARE TWO OF THE ORGANIZATIONS IN THIS VARIETY OF OTHER STUDENTS TO ORGANIZATIONS THAT- CAME TOGETHER- AND APPROACH ME WITH THIS GENERAL REQUEST TO- HAVE REPRESENTATION. BUT IT DOES SEEM AN- ADVOCATE. CAN A SCHOOL AT STUDENT REPRESENT TODAY. ABSENT YOUR- I'D THAT THEY CAN YES OKAY SO- THAT LOCAL CONTROL EXISTS RIGHT NOW FOR SCHOOL BOARDS IF THEY WANT TO BRING A STUDENT. I THINK I GUESS WHAT'S OF NOTE IN YOURS IS THAT YOU'RE NOT REALLY GIVING THEM THE POWER. UNIT SENATE CAN VOTE. EFFECT EIGHT AS I UNDERSTAND THE ANALYSIS. THEY'RE NOT ALLOWED TO CAST A VOTE THAT'S THE KIND OF CLOAK OF CONSEQUENTIAL LOADS THAT RIGHT. THEN AND THAT'S TRUE IN MANY SITUATIONS WHERE STUDENTS ARE MEMBERS OF THE BOARD- THEY THEY HAVE AN ADVISORY VOTE VOTE BUT THEY ARE ALLOWED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE CONVERSATIONS. YOU'RE ALLOWED TO PROVIDE STUDENT PERSPECTIVE- WHICH I THINK SCHOOL BOARDS MANY SCHOOL BOARDS FELL INTO. A VERY VALUABLE AT THE SAME TIME THERE ARE SOME COUNTY BOARD OF EDUCATION ACCESS- OR THAT- HAVE NOT OPEN THEMSELVES UP TO THAT KIND OF- INPUTTED THAT'S WHAT TO WHAT TO STUDENTS ARE TRYING TO ADDRESS IS TO HAVE SOME MECHANISM TO BE ABLE TO- ASKED FOR AND OBTAINED A AN ADVISORY VOTE DOWN TO AN OPPORTUNITY TO ACTUALLY BE THERE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE CONVERSATION. WHEN SENSITIVE TOPICS TO STUDENTS- INTEREST TO COME UP. WITH THAT THAT RIGHT WOULD EXIST TODAY UNDER A PUBLIC HEARING REQUIREMENTS WOULD NOT. END IN ANY SCHOOL BOARD THAT THAT. THAT THEY WOULD HAVE A HAVE A RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN TO SHARE THEIR OPINIONS SIX CERTAINLY THAT RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE- BUT IT CERTAINLY HAS MORE HEFT AND IT HAS- A MORE INFORMED MEMBER. IF IT IS SOMEBODY THAT CONSISTENTLY SITS AT THE GOVERNING BODY HEY HEARINGS HERE'S THE KIND THE OTHER KINDS OF ISSUES. RATHER THAN SOMEBODY THAT COMES IN ON ONE PARTICULAR ISSUE- DOESN'T HAVE ESTABLISHED RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE OTHER PEOPLE ON THE BOARD. I THINK WE- I THINK COMMON SENSE OF MOST OF THE TIME WOULD INDICATE THAT. PEOPLE THAT OUR REGULAR MEMBERS AND ATTEND REGULARLY- UNDERSTAND. ALL OF THE ISSUES ARE GOING TO BE MORE OR- LAW- THAN SOME WHO HAS NOT ABLE TO BE THERE. IT'S NOT TO ARE SOFT. AND IF I MAY CENTER AYE WITH THIS BILLS TO DO YOU WHAT YOU WERE SAYING IS CORRECT A CAN GO ATTACK. BUT THIS WOULD HAVE GIVE THEM THE BILL TO BE ON THE BOARD AND BE A PART OF OUR WHICH IS MORE INCLUSIVE THAN JUST ATTENDING THE MEETING YEAH AND I DO FIND THAT FAIRLY COMPELLING TO ME BECAUSE I RECOGNIZE THE VALUE THAT THAT BRINGS- BUT CERTAINLY WE WANT TO BE SURE THAT MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WITHIN THEIR OWN NUMBER THE BORDER NOT HAVE ACCESS TO ALL THE MATERIALS. AND ACCESS TO ALL THE MEMBERS- TO BE ABLE TO ENGAGE AND- BUT I DO THINK THAT THE- THE SEAT AT THE TABLE IS A VALUABLE THING. AND I GUESS SO I'M HAPPY TO LOSE ABILITY AND MOVE IT FORWARD THAT INDUSTRY SELLING THEM BUT I WOULD ALSO JOIN WITH MY COLLEAGUE IN ASKING THAT. EQUIPMENT MISUNDERSTANDING OR NOT I CERTAINLY WOULD LIKE TO SEE WORK OUT THESE ISSUES WITH THE CHARTER SCHOOL COMMUNITY AS WELL. AND SO I'M HOPING THAT BEFORE THE ISSUE COMES THE FLOOR THAT THAT THAT CAN BE SETTLED AND THEY AND THEY HAVE A NEW ENJOY MY SUPPORT THEY HAVE AND WITH THAT SHOT AND YOU'RE NOT BE TO MOVE THE PURPOSE ON. THANK YOU DO WE HAVE ANY OF THAT YES IS TRAUB. GOOD MORE. AS A MEMBER BY- THINK IT'S MUCH FOR BRING THIS. THIS FORD. I TO SAY IS A FORMER SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER. AND SOMEONE WHO WAS PRIVY TO HAVING ACTUALLY MY DAUGHTER SERVE ON THE SCHOOL BOARD AS A STUDENT REPRESENTATIVE FOR HER HIGH SCHOOL- I THINK. THIS IS AN IN A REALLY. GOOD EFFORT AND INTENT ON HAVING THAT. I DO HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF A CONCERN WITH THE MANDATE PART OF IT- BECAUSE I DO BELIEVE AS- SENATOR. GLAZER HAD MENTIONED EARLIER. IT IS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE TO. OUR STUDENTS AND OUR SCHOOL. BOARD MEMBERS TO CHOOSE TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT- AS IT STANDS RIGHT NOW WITH OUR STUDENTS BE ABLE TO PETITION. THE ABILITY TO BE ON THE BOARD AND BEYOND- NO A MEMBER I REPRESENTATIVE FOR THEIR SCHOOL DISTRICTS I DO BELIEVE THAT THAT IS ALREADY. ADDED THAT IN EFFECT. A POSSIBILITY IN OUR IN OUR IN OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS. AND I DO SHARE ALSO. SENATOR DOLLIES ADD CONCERNED WITH REGARDS TO- THE ISSUE AS FAR AS THE CHARTER SCHOOLS. AND THE LANGUAGE. SPECIFICALLY STATED TO BE ABLE TO ACCOMMODATE THERE ARE SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH THEY FUNCTION. AND I WOULD HATE TO. YOU KNOW FURTHER A- A BILL THAT WOULD INCAPACITATE. THEM FROM- BE ABLE TO CONDUCT A BET AS IS BECAUSE THEY HAVE WOULD HAVE TO WAIT FOR AB. FOR APPROVALS SO AM I AM GOING TO STAY OFF THIS BILL RIGHT AT THIS MOMENT- UNTIL WE HAVE THAT CLARIFICATION OF THE LANGUAGE BUT I DO LOOK FORWARD TO SUPPORTING IT IN THE FUTURE- AND LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING AS SOMETHING IT WITH THE CHARTER SCHOOLS BEING. ACCOMMODATED THERE- IN THAT IT BUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR REFORM EXCITED ABOUT THIS BILL AND I LOOK FORWARD TO AND HOPEFULLY SUPPORTING IN THE FUTURE. VERY GOOD AND BEFORE WE MOVED HERE CLOSER I WOULD JUST SAY FOR THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS WHAT THIS BILL DOES. IS IT REQUIRES THE BOARD TO ACCEPT THE STUDENT POSITION WITH A PETITION RIGHT NOW THEY DO NOT HAVE TO ACCEPT THE POSITION PETITION. SO THIS BILL WOULD MAKE IT THAT THE BOARD HAS TO ACCEPT THE PETITION. SO IT JUST GIVES THE STUDENTS A LITTLE MORE POWER. ALL RIGHT WITH THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND JUST LIKE TO ADDRESS TO THE TWO ISSUES THAT- YOU HAVE- BROUGHT UP HERE. A NUMBER ONE WITH THE ISSUE OF MANDATE- I THINK FROM THE STUDENTS PERSPECTIVE AND FROM THIS PERSPECTIVE OF CALIFORNIA. OF THE IDEA THAT WE ARE IN BRACING OF THE CONCEPT OF WE WANT TO HEAR FROM THE STUDENTS WERE AFFECTED BY A SCHOOL BOARD DECISION. RATHER THAN IT BEING JUST SIMPLY OPTIONAL FOR SCHOOL BOARD I THINK IT WOULD SPEAK- VOLUMES TO PROTECT THE STUDENTS THAT HAVE BEEN ADVOCATING FOR THIS AND OTHER STUDENTS SHOULD FOLLOW LIKE YOUR DAUGHTER WHO HAD THAT OPPORTUNITY- FOR. OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THROUGH THE SENATE AND THROUGH THE ASSEMBLY AND THE SIGNATURE OF THE GOVERNOR- TO SAY THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE WANT ALL SCHOOL BOARDS- TO INCLUDE. THAT PARTICULARLY WITH THE PROVISIONS THAT ARE IN HERE THAT MAKE SURE IT'S NOT% INAPPROPRIATE- IT'S A GOOD ADVISORY VOTE BUT IT INCLUDES THAT VOICE- THEN I THINK IN THIS TIME OF DIVISION THAT WE HAVE- THAT HAVING YOUNGER PEOPLE FEEL LIKE THEY'RE VALUED. BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS VALUABLE SO I THOUGHT I WOULD SPEAK TO THAT IS WHY THE MANDATE AS POSSIBLE. WE ALL KNOW THAT THERE ARE A VARIETY OF CULTURES IN IN THE- THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA ON COUNTY BOARD OF EDUCATION ACCESS- AND SOME OF THOSE ARE NOT AS WELCOMING OF STUDENTS VOICES AS OTHERS. AND THEN WITH REGARDS TO BOTH THE- THE ISSUES RAISED BY- CENTER DALIAN AND- SENATOR GLAZERS- I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT THE- CHARTER SCHOOLS ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN VERY PROFESSIONAL AND. AND COLLEGIAL IN TERMS OF WORKING WITH US- I THINK WE'VE A MAJOR GOOD FAITH EFFORT TRY TO WORK WITH THEM. I'VE BUT THAT STAFF OF YOUR COMMITTEE HERE THE EDUCATION COMMITTEE. HAS ALSO WORKED DILIGENTLY TO TRY TO ADDRESS OUR CONCERNS SO- WE HAVE MADE A GOOD FAITH EFFORT AND- WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THEM PROFESSIONALLY- IN THE HOPES THAT- WE ADDRESS. WHAT WHATEVER CONCERNS STILL SEEMS TO REMAIN THANK YOU. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER I THINK I HAVE ONE MORE COMMENT FROM ASSEMBLY MARK HUGHES CENTER GLAZER. THANK YOU CHAIR- THEY THE I JUST WANNA CLARIFY AMOUNT OF SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY. MY GENERAL PRACTICE IS DAY TO DEFERRED TILL THE LOCAL. SCHOOL BOARDS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS SOME OF BIG LOCAL CONTROL PERSON. AND I THINK THE CHALLENGE ON A BILL THAT MATCHES MY VALUES AND THINGS THAT I THINK THAT SHOULD BE DONE IT. TYPICALLY WE- WE WILL. I SUPPORT MANDATES WHEN WE HAVE A PROBLEM. WHEN SCHOOL BOARDS HAVE NOT DONE SOMETHING THAT THAT IT MATCHES YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO- AND IN THIS CASE IT'S A TOTAL AND CLEAR THAT WE HAVE PROBLEMS WERE SO THE STUDENTS HAVE PETITIONED AND THEY'VE THAT SCHOOL BOARDS A SAID NOW. BUT I DO RECOGNIZE THE UNIQUE BUT A PLACE THAT STUDENTS HAVE IN OUR WORLD. THEY DON'T HAVE THE SAME POWER ACCESS TRANSPORTATION IS THE COMMUNICATION IS A LOT OF ISSUES THAT. CAN CREATE IMPEDIMENTS TO REALLY. RAISING THOSE TYPES OF OBJECTIONS AND I THINK THOSE ARE STILL COMPELLING TO ME IN THIS CASE. I'M HAPPY TO MOVE THE BILL.
