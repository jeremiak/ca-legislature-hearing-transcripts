IS A QUORUM IS PRESENT WE HAVE ONE ITEM BEFORE TODAY BUT BEFORE WE DO THAT WE WILL ADOPT THE COMMITTEE RULES -- SHOW -- I'M SECRETARY PLEASE READ RULES. SENATOR BRADFORD HI. I CHANG. COMING I DON'T MIND. I DURAZO. RATHER I WAS SO. SO I MORALE. HI. I FORTINO [inaudible] FIVE OKAY THAT MEASURE IT PASSES WILL LEAVE THE ROLE OPEN FOR THOSE ABSENT MEMBERS TO ADD ON AS STATED WE HAVE ONE ITEM BEFORE TODAY AS THREE FIFTY ONE BY SENATOR HERTZBERG. TO MEASURE THAT WE HAVE HEARD BUT FIRST LET ME WELCOME THE NEW MEMBERS. TO THE COMMITTEE -- SENATOR ASOS CENTER CAP JARL THANK YOU. FOR BEING HERE AND SENATOR HERTZBERG WHEN YOU'RE READY YOU MAY PRESENT AS PROOF IF YOU WANT AND WELCOME I'M TREASURE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH IN HIS CHAIR OF A THERE'S A COUPLE OF CHANGES IN THIS BILL FROM WHAT IT WAS LAST YEAR BUT THE SAME MOST SIGNIFICANT IMPACTFUL CHANGE. IS THAT LAST YEAR HAD A DIFFERENT SPONSOR. LAST YEAR MY SPONSOR WAS A MEMBER OF THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION NOW MY SPONSOR IS THE TREASURER OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN THE SAME PERSON FIONA MAW. I READ THAT YOU CAN PROVE JUST THE FEELING OF AWE THE ORIGINAL. SO JUST REAL QUICKLY A PERFECTLY FOR THE NEW MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. HERE'S THE PROBLEM THAT WE FACE THAT WE'RE TRYING TO SOLVE. BASICALLY BECAUSE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SAYS THAT MARIJUANA IS A SCHEDULE ONE DRUG YOU CAN'T TAKE THE PROCEEDS AND PUT IT IN THE BANK BECAUSE IT'S CONSIDERED. SO NOW YOU'VE GOT A BANK THAT'S PART OF THE FEDERAL SYSTEM THAT DEALS WITH THE CLEARINGHOUSE ALIKE OR FEDERAL RESERVE INSURANCE. AND IT'S IT'S LIKE TAKING ILLEGAL DRUG MONEY SO THEY CAN'T DO IT SO WE HAVE -- I DON'T KNOW THIS FOR FACT STANDING TOTALLY MISTER MCGUIRE WHO SERVES THE NORTHERN PART OF THE STATE TOLD ME THAT HE THINKS THERE'S TWO BILLION DOLLARS BURIED IN BARRELS UP IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. FROM THIS BUSINESS BUT CERTAINLY IS A LOT OF CASH I MET A GENTLEMAN WHO CAME TO MY OFFICE IS IS HE'S GOT A TRACTOR TRAILER WITH FORTY MILLION DOLLARS CASH IT. YOU KNOW DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH IT SO THE QUESTION IS AS A GOVERNMENT WHAT DO WE DO IN OUR GOVERNMENT TO TRY TO ON THE ONE HAND TAKE WITH THE VOTERS HAVE SAID BY A WIDE MARGIN. INSTEAD WHAT WE WANT NO ONE TO BE LEGAL. AND IT'S INCONSISTENT WITH THE WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S ROLE AND HOW DO WE DEAL WITH THE MONEY. HOW DO WE PAY PEOPLE HOW DO WE PROVIDE SAFETY FOR WORKERS IN THE SYSTEM HOW DOES THE GOVERNMENT? GET GET ITS TAX MONEY HOW AS THE TREASURE WILL TELL YOU WE CREATE RECORDS AND THE LIKE SO WE CAME UP WITH THIS KIND OF HYBRID APPROACH WHICH WE CALL A LIMITED CHARTER BANK. IN ESSENCE WHAT IT IS IS THAT YOU CAN ONLY USE IT FOR A COUPLE OF PURPOSES IT DOESN'T SOLVE ALL THE PROBLEMS BUT IT SOLVES PART OF THE PROBLEMS. AND SO IF YOU LOOK AT THIS CHECK THE IDEA IS YOU OPEN A BANK ACCOUNT. ARM IN EUROPE ML ON A COMPANY WHATEVER AD YOU CAN PUT YOUR MONEY INTO THAT PLACE THERE'S NINE HUNDRED EIGHTY TWO BANK BRANCHES AROUND CALIFORNIA THEY'RE EMPTY THAT ARE CLOSE. TO THE IDEA OF JUST RENTING THOSE FOR NEW COMPANIES THAT WANT TO BE BANKS IS PRETTY SIMPLE THERE'S IT BE PRETTY EASY SHE'S NOT REALLY EXPENSIVE GONNA TAKE A LOT OF TIME. THE IDEA IS THAT MOVE URGENTLY THIS BILL MOVED ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE LAST TIME AND THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE ON THIS COMMITTEE AND ITS CHAIRMAN JOINED ON AS AS A CO AUTHOR IS PART OF THIS. BUT THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE BASICALLY FROM EVERYTHING I CAN DETERMINE INTERNALLY. COMMUNICATED WITH THE OTHER HOUSE AND TOLD THEM AN APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE I WAS TOLD TO HOLD THE BILL BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T WANT TO DEAL WITH THAT THEY FELT THAT THE REGULATORY SIDE SOME OF THE OTHER ISSUES WOULD BE TO CHALLENGE. AND I'M I DON'T DENY THAT THEY'RE CHALLENGING. BUT THE FLIP SIDE IS WE SEE STORIES OF PEOPLE GETTING KILLED AND MURDERED. IT AND THE LIKE BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE CARRYING CASH IT'S JUST CREATES A HUGE PROBLEM SO WE'RE TRYING TO CREATE UNTIL THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ACTUALLY LEGALIZES THE STUFF. A PLAUSIBLE IN A ROOM INTERREGNUM IF YOU WILL AND ABILITY TO HOLD THIS IN THIS TWILIGHT ZONE THAT WORKS. AND SO THE CONCEPT IS WHEN YOU GO TO A NORMAL BANK YOU KNOW YOU PUT YOUR MONEY IN AND THEY PAY THIS MUCH INTEREST DOWN HERE AND THEY LANDED OUT HERE AND THEY MAKE THEIR PROFIT ON INTEREST. YOU CAN'T LEND MONEY HERE SO WITH THE WAY THIS BANK ID IS A C. IDEAS IF YOU OPEN AN ACCOUNT OF MY CAR TO THREE THOUSAND BUCKS A MONTH TO HAVE AN ACCOUNT. WITH US LESS MONEY THAT WOULD COST YOU TO HOLD THE MONEY PAY FOR SECURITY DEAL WITH ALL THE STUFF. AND THEN WHAT WE WANT TO DO TO BE ABLE TO PUT LESS CASH IN THE SYSTEM IS THAT PEOPLE ARE PART OF THE SYSTEM CAN USE A CHECK. OUT WHAT WE CALL THEM THE CHECK IT HERE'S AN EXAMPLE BECAUSE WHAT WE'RE SAYING ON THE CHECK IS THIS CHECK IS ISSUED. BY THIS BANK DEPOSITS ARE CASH ONLY LIMITED CHARTER BANK OR CREDIT UNION AND NOBODY ELSE YOU COULDN'T TAKE THIS BANK AND SAY PUT IT. TO TO THE TO ME THIS CHECK AND PUT IT IN CHASE OR BANK OF AMERICA ONLY YOUR BANK OR ANOTHER BANK SO NOW THERE'S FOUR AREAS WE LOOK TO FIRST. IF YOUR LANDLORD LANDLORD HAS THREE TENANTS EACH ONE'S PAYING TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND A MONTH ALL THE SO THEY BRING IN TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND ON THE FIRST OF THE MONTH NOW THEY CAN WRITE A CHECK. AND TAKE THE MONEY NOW THE LANDLORD TO DO TWO THINGS ONE THE LAND I CAN OPEN ACCOUNT AT THE BANK. OKAY OR TWO CAN GO TAKE WHEN THEY WHEN THEY HAVE A PROPER ABILITY TO DO IT TAKE ALL THE CHECKS THE BANK CASH THEM AND THEN HAVE THEM OR HAVE THE BANKS WOULD ARMORED CAR TAKE THEM TO THEIR BANK. SECOND. I'M A PLUMBER. I HAVE -- I'M PROVIDING -- SERVICES TO A BUNCH OF THESE COMPANIES THAT DO YOU KNOW D THE PIPELINES FOR THE PLANTS RIGHT. IS IT MY DRIVER HAVE TO PICK UP CASH I GET PAID FOR BY CHECK AGAIN OPEN AN ACCOUNT HE JUST MANAGEMENT OF RISK AND THE LIKE. THIRD -- THE THE IDEA OF GOVERNMENTS WHICH IS THE MOST IMPORTANT WE SAW LAST YEAR NUMBER OF BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSALS I MET WITH THE HEAD OF THE E. D. MR HENNING. TELLING ME HOW HARD IT IS TO YOU KNOW HOW LONG IT TAKES TO COUNT THE CASH. THEY GOT UP WITH BULLET PROOF WINDOWS AND THEY GOT TO PAY THE HIGH WHICH OLD ACCOUNT TO MOVE THE MONEY NOW THE SUDDEN. YOU CAN PAY THE MONEY TO TO TO TO YOUR AGENCY'S WHETHER TO STATE AGENCY OR WHATEVER WHICH HOPEFULLY RESULTS IN US GETTING MORE REVENUE TO PAY. AND LASTLY ALTHOUGH WE PUT THIS BACK IN THE IDEA OF TO INVEST WITH THE TREASURER'S OFFICE IF YOU HAVE MONEY IN THE BANK AND YOU WANT TO GET. INTEREST WELL YOU ONLY INVESTING pSOLUTION SO IT'S CLOSE YOU ONLY CAN TRADE WITH YOURSELF. AND THE SECOND THING IS YOU HAVE TO A PRIVATE INSURANCE CAN'T USE FDIC YOU INSURE THE DEALS AND WE'VE TALKED SOME INSURERS ARE WILLING TO DO THAT. SO THE IDEA IS TO CREATE THIS LIMITED CHARTER BANK AND THEN ULTIMATELY WHAT WE DID THE ONLY OTHER CHANGE OTHER THAN THAT WE HAVE THE TREASURE NOW. IS WE ADDED THE SUNSET PROVISION OF THE RECOMMENDATION OF THE BANKING COMMISSION ON THE DEPARTMENT'S COLUMN OLD GUY REMEMBER THE OLD NAMES. WHO'S THAT WAS VERY SMART THEY DID WAS A SUNSET PROVISION MEANING THAT ONCE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DECIDES TO DO THIS. WE'VE GOT A SHOW A WINDOW THAT THESE BANKS HAVE TO THEN BECOME REGULAR RISE BANKS THEY CAN'T BE THESE LIMITED CHARTERED BANKS WHICH MAKES PERFECT SENSE THERE WERE ONLY INTENDED TO BE A BRIDGE. AND THE LAST THING ABOUT IT IS. THESE ARE NOT MORE GOVERNMENT'S GONNA GO AND HAVE TO OPEN A BANK AND STUFF LIKE THAT THEIR PRIVATE INVESTORS AND SO THE IDEA BEHIND CREATING LIMITED CHARTER BANK WAS. SOMEBODY COMES UP IN PACE WITH SOME ACROSS FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TO START A BANK THE INVESTMENT BANK THEY GET. THREE OUR CUSTOMERS FIVE HUNDRED CUSTOMERS THEY GOT A GOOD ACCOUNT AND THEN WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IS THE BIG ENTITIES GONNA COME IN BY A MOB. AND THE KEY THE GENIUS OF THIS THING THAT I THINK THAT'S SO IMPORTANT A SIDE WHICH THE TREASURES GONNA TALK ABOUT OF% KEEPING RECORDS. IS THAT WE DIDN'T INVENT SOMETHING BRAND NEW. WE BUILT THIS WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF BANKS SO FOR THE SHOP OCCASION STAYS THE SAME BOARD OF DIRECTORS OBLIGATION STAYS THE SAME AUDITING PROVISIONS STAY THE SAME. EVERYTHING ELSE WAS WHOLE BODY OF LAW THAT'S BEEN DEVELOPED WE COULD HAVE WRITTEN THE WHOLE THING AGAIN BUT WE PUT WE BASICALLY INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE TO THAT YOU GET TREATED LIKE A BANK. SO THAT THEN WHEN THE RECORDS AND HOW IT'S BEING TAKEN CARE OF AND ALL OF A SUDDEN CHART A CHASE COMES OVER AND SAYS THEY WANT TO BUY. SAY THE COMMA EURO DANK BANKYOU KNOW AND A YOU YOU GOT -- TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN DEPOSITS THEY WANT TO BUY THIS IT'S EASY FOR THEM TO BUY BECAUSE THEY UNDERSTAND THE SYSTEM BECAUSE ALREADY BANKING. THE IDEA WAS GREAT THE SHORT TERM SOLUTION. TO IT THE FACT THE MOST NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN A WAY THAT WORKS IF TEN DIFFERENT BANKS COME TOGETHER THEY CAN HAVE AN AGREEMENT AMONG THEMSELVES TO TRADE CHECKS. YOU KNOW AND THEN THE LAST THING OBVIOUSLY IS IF SOMEBODY IS A CUSTOMER FOR MARIJUANA THEY CAN OPEN UP AN ACCOUNT YOUR BANK PUT A THOUSAND AND GET A CREDIT CARD. AND THEN THEY CAN USE IT AT YOUR PLACE AND THEN ONLY ELECTRONICALLY TRANSFERS AGAIN. D. RISKING CURRY GENERAL PUBLIC SAFETY. LESS COSTS. EASY TO ROLL INTO A LARGER PICTURE BETTER RECORDS WITH THE TREASURE WE'LL TALK ABOUT ALL TURN OVER HERE NOW. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS AND CENTER HURTS FOR GLAD TO BE BACK HERE AGAIN TALKING ABOUT ONE OF MY FAVORITE TOPICS -- WHEN I WAS ON THE STATE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION -- I FOUND OUT THAT WE STARTED TRYING TO COLLECT CANNABIS REVENUES -- BACK. STARTING IN NINETEEN NINETY SIX BUT IT WAS REALLY INCONSISTENT BECAUSE THERE WEREN'T A LOT OF FOLKS -- REGISTERING TAKING UP THEIR SALES TAX PERMITS -- UNDERSTANDING HOW TO EVEN -- COMPLY AND SO WE SPENT A BETTER OF TWO YEARS GOING AROUND THE STATE TRYING TO ADVISE. OF FOLKS WHO HAD A DISPENSARY ABOUT THEIR OBLIGATION TO FILE. FOR THEIR SALES TAX PERMITS AND ACTUALLY HAVE TO FILE EITHER QUARTERLY OR MONTHLY -- THE ONES THAT DID NOT -- THE WAY WE WOULD AUDIT THEM IS WE WOULD STAND OUTSIDE OF THE DISPENSARY. COUPLE DAYS OF THE MONTH I'M SUPPOSED TO BE THREE DAYS OF THE MONTH AND THE COUNT HOW MANY PEOPLE WENT IN WE WOULD. ASSESS A DOLLAR AVERAGE DOLLAR AMOUNT MAYBE SIXTY DOLLARS PER PERSON WE WOULD EXTRAPOLATE BACK THREE YEARS ASSESSED INTEREST AND PENALTIES AND SEND THEM A BILL AND WE WOULD HOPE THAT THEY WOULD PAY. OUT NOT VERY EFFICIENT SO IT STARTED ME DOWN THIS ROAD OF WHY DON'T THEY HAVE BANKING -- VERY HARD TO AUDIT. CASH BUSINESSES AS WE ALL KNOW -- BUT RIGHT NOW MANY OF THESE BUSINESSES DON'T HAVE A BANK ACCOUNT SO THEY OPERATE AN ALL CASH -- THEY DON'T GIVE US RECORDS AS AUDITORS WHEN WE GO IN AND AUDIT THEM NECESSARILY -- BUT BE. PROBLEM IS THE SAFETY REQUIREMENTS OF MANY OF THESE FOLKS WHO DID PAY THEIR SALES TAXES WOULD COME TO OUR BOARD OF EQUALIZATION OFFICES WITH. DUFFEL BAG SOMETIMES SUITCASES OF CASH -- IT WASN'T SAFE IT WAS INEFFICIENT FOR OUR EMPLOYEES TO BE COUNTING. ON THIS HIGH AMOUNT OF CASH AND NOW WITH THE PASSAGE OF PROP SIXTY FOUR IT IS EXACERBATING. THE SITUATION BECAUSE NOT ONLY ARE THEY SUPPOSED TO PAY THEIR SALES TAXES BUT DISTRIBUTION TAX CULTIVATION TAX. AS WELL AS ANY OTHER LOCAL TAXES THAT MAY BE ASSESSED ON THIS INDUSTRY SO WE THINK THIS IS A GREAT A TEMPORARY SOLUTION -- WENT BACK TO DC TO TESTIFY BEFORE THE BANKING HOUSE SUBCOMMITTEE ABOUT A MONTH AGO -- BILLS ARE STARTING TO MOVE A LITTLE BIT LIKE THE PROBLEM UNDER BILL -- BUT IT'S GOING TO BE SLOW GOING SO -- WE DEFINITELY NEED A SOLUTION TEMPER SOLUTION UNTIL THE BANKS OPEN UP -- THEIR DOORS TO THIS INDUSTRY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS AMY JENKINS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CANNABIS INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION AND NUMEROUS INDIVIDUAL CLIENTS -- TO CONTINUE TO BE CHALLENGED BY THE LACK OF ACCESS TO BANKING IN CALIFORNIA -- THE ASSOCIATION HAS ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED MEMBERS AND THIS IS GENERALLY ONE OF THE TOP PRIORITIES THAT WE TALK ABOUT CONSISTENTLY. I WANT TO APPLAUD THE AUTHOR AND TREASURE MA FOR CONTINUING TO ADVOCATE AND WORK ON THIS ISSUE WE WERE PLEASED TO JOIN THE TREASURE IN DC -- WHEN SHE PRESENTED TESTIMONY -- TO THE HOUSE FINANCE COMMITTEE ON THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE AND WE'RE VERY APPRECIATIVE OF THE ON GOING WORK THAT'S BEING DONE HERE -- JUST TO PUT IT IN PERSPECTIVE AS YOU NOW AND AS THE TREASURE LOOTED -- WE WE DO WE ARE THIS THE SITUATION IS EXACERBATED WITH THE PASSAGE OF SIXTY FOUR AND ALL OF THE TAXES THAT THE COMPLAINT CANNABIS INDUSTRY IS REQUIRED TO PAY IN CALIFORNIA -- I WAS JUST SPEAKING TO A CLIENT OF MINE WHO IS ALSO A CCA AND A MEMBER IN THE AUDIENCE AND THEY RE MET ABOUT A MILLION DOLLARS IN CASH EVERY MONTH -- ADD TO THE STATE IF YOU THINK ABOUT THAT IT TRANSLATES TO OVER FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND TWENTY DOLLAR BILLS IN THE YEAR -- IT TAKES AN EXORBITANT AMOUNT OF TIME AND ENERGY AND STAFF THEY BURN THROUGH CASH COUNTING MACHINES I THINK ABOUT SIX A MONTH. AND SO ON IT'S A REAL TREMENDOUS PROBLEM -- AND THAT IS COUPLED WITH ALL OF THE PUBLIC SAFETY CONCERNS THAT ALSO HAVE BEEN CITED BY THE AUTHOR IN THE STREET STATE TREASURER I HEAR COUNTLESS INS INSTANCES WHERE -- THEY'VE BEEN FOLLOWED THERE HAS BEEN THEFT A LOT OF IT IS LARGELY UNREPORTED -- BUT THIS IS INDEED A VERY VERY SIGNIFICANT ISSUE FOR THE INDUSTRY WHICH IS WHY WE'RE PLEASED TO BE HERE TODAY AND STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS BILL THANK YOU. THIS ISN'T. STATE YOUR NAME YOUR ORGANIZATION OUR MEMBERS TRUST BUCKLEY ON BEHALF OF THE CITY OF SACRAMENTO IN SUPPORT. ALICIA PRIEGO HERE ON BEHALF OF EASE AND SUPPORT.

TEN MORE THAN COMPLAINTS STRICTER FROM ORIGIN HOUSE AND STRONG SUPPORT. MORE INTERNET AGNETA CAN AS BUSINESS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT. LASHANDRA REPRESENTINGTHE CAL ASIAN CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES AND SUPPORT. WHEN THIS IS AN OPPOSITION COMPORT? SCENE NINE HAVE QUESTIONS BY THE COMMITTEE [inaudible] SENATOR RAZA. TRYING TO UNDERSTAND HOW THIS WOULD WORK BUT I TOTALLY AGREE THAT WE NEED A MECHANISM AND WHO KNOWS WHEN IT'S GONNA. HAPPEN AT THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BUT I'M NOT QUITE SURE HOW THIS WORKS IS SO. IF I TAKE MY MONEY AS IT CANNABIS BUSINESS AND I I WANT TO PAY MY LANDLORD. AS YOU SAID. I'M GLAD TO BE A LANDMARK. AND SO I WRITE A CHECK OUT RIGHT FROM SUCH AND SUCH. CREDIT YOU. AND GIVE IT TO THE LANDLORD. DOESN'T HE HAVE TO LIKE AGREE THAT THIS IS A CREDIT UNION AND THAT HIS BANK. WILL. ACCEPT IT AS WELL BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO ME IS NOT JUST A MATTER OF WHO WE GIVE IT. TO BUT EACH OF THE INSTITUTIONS. THAT ARE RELATED TO THAT SO THE LANDLORD HAS HIS OWN BANK AND GORE CREDIT UNION. THE STATE HAS THEIR OWN BANK THE VENDORS HAVE THEIR OWN BANK SO. DON'T THEY ALL HAVE TO AGREE THAT THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE -- INSTANT BANKING INSTITUTION OTHERWISE IT DOESN'T WORK WELL HERE LET'S LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT LANDLORD PLACE OVER HERE -- IN YOU KNOW IN HIS HUNDRED THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT. BUILDING YOU'RE PAYING A HUNDRED THOUSAND A MONTH. FOR AND ON THE YEAH EVEN YOU PAM NORMALLY YOU'D YOU'D BRING IN CASH OR YOU'D MEET HIM AT THE BANK OR HIS REPRESENTATIVE AT THE BANK AND YOU GIVE THE BANK THE CASH IN THE BANK THE STATE USED TO DO THAT WITH A LITTLE RESET OF THE DESK. YOU PAY THE TAXES THEY TURN AROUND HANDS OF THE BANK YES LANDLORD WAY SO HAS TO ACCEPT IT. BUT LANDLORD WAY SO HE HAS ONLY TWO OPTIONS. ONE IF YOU ACCEPT YOUR CHECK RIGHT. HE CAN GO TO YOUR BANK. AT HIS CONVENIENCE THAT WAS A TIME WHEN HE HAS A SECURITY GUARD OR HE OURS AT A TRUCK CASH THAT CHECK AT YOUR BANK. GET THE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS AND THEN PUT IT IN THE ARMORED CAR OR THE TRUNK OF HIS CAR EVERY CHOOSE TO DO IT AND TAKE IT TO HIS BANK AND MAKE THE DEPOSIT IT'S A CONVENIENCE. FOR HIM AND HIS EMPLOYEES AND SAFETY AND THE LIKE. IF HE DOESN'T WANT TO TAKE IT HE DOESN'T HAVE TO TAKE IT OKAY BUT HE CAN'T DEPOSIT THIS INTO HIS BANK BUT WHAT LANDLORD WAY SO WE'LL PROBABLY DO. IS LANDED WAY SO BECAUSE HE'S GOT TEN CUSTOMERS LIKE YOU WHEN HE GETS A MILLION DOLLARS A MONTH. HERE'S ONE HANDLING MUH CASH HE GETS TEN CHECKS HE OPENS THOSE ACCOUNT AT CABALLERO -- THE CHARTER BANK AND THE PAUSES A MILLION DOLLARS IN HER ACCOUNT OKAY NOW IS THAT A MILLION DOLLARS IN IN IN HER BANK. SO WHAT DOES HE DO WITH THAT MILLION HE CAN EITHER TAKE WHAT HE WANTS TO BRING AN ARMORED CAR FOR MANAGEMENT PURPOSES. AND TAKE THAT MILLION FROM COLONIAL BANK LIMITED CHARTER. BANK AND TAKE IT TO BANK OF AMERICA WHERE EVERY TAKES IT TO OR WHAT YOU CAN DO IS. YOU CAN SAY OKAY I'VE GOT A TAX BILL OF A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS I'M GONNA PAY TAXES WITH IT. I'M GONNA BY STATE FARM WITH IT THAT'S TWO THOUSAND BILL I'M GOING TO PAY. SOME OTHER THINGS WITH IT NOW ONLY HAVE SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND LESS THAN A MINUTE TRANSFER THAT IT'S A CONVENIENCE MECHANISM THAT'S AN INNER ROOM DEAL THAT WE'RE PROVIDING FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE MANAGING THIS MUCH CASH. AND FROM THE STATE STANDPOINT. WE'RE REDUCING OUR EXPENSES BECAUSE IT'S SO EXPENSIVE THEY GOT A CASH LIKE WHEN YOU GET THIS MONEY THE COMMITMENT THAT CAT CAT LIKE THREE TIMES. TAKES LIKE THREE EMPLOYEES TWO DAYS TO COUNT THE MONEY AND THEN YOU GOTTA HAVE A BULLET PROOF STUFF AND EVERYTHING LIKE THAT. SO IT'S A LOT BETTER AND ALSO MAKES IT EASIER FOR PEOPLE TO PAY THEIR BILLS SO IT'S NOT BY ANY STRETCH OF IMAGINATION A PERFECT SOLUTION. IT'S A VERY SHORT TERM INTERIM THING OF WHAT IS A HORRIBLE SITUATION THAT'S THAT THAT I THINK IS THE BEST WAY TO EXPLAIN IT THAT'S OKAY. THE THOUGHT. YEAH I MEAN WE ANTICIPATE IF THIS BILL GETS THE COVERS US THAT THERE BE I DON'T KNOW TEN TWENTY BANKS. AROUND THE STATE THAT WOULD -- BE PART OF THIS NETWORK AND JUST LIKE YOU KNOW JUST LIKE YOU'RE WITH A NETWORK OF OF BANKSY'S WOULD BE ALSO A NETWORK UNTIL. THE BANKING INDUSTRY FULLY OPENS UP. AM I SURE [inaudible] YOUR QUESTION -- MORROW. I HAVE A QUESTION IF FARM BECAUSE YOU KNOW FEDERAL LAWS WERE. BILL A CHALLENGE HERE IF THEY DECIDE TO SOME. SO YOU HAVE YOUR MONEY IN A BANK. IN A FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS THERE ANY PROVISIONS IN YOUR BILL TO PROTECT [inaudible] A DEPOSITOR. IN CASE THE FEDS COMMAND. AND TRY TO SEIZE ASSETS EVEN. MAYBE SEASON THE ASSETS OF ANOTHER -- DEPOSITOR NOW BANK SO THOSE ARE PROVISIONS IN THAT BILL THAT GUARANTEES AND PROTECTS YOUR GUY HIS MONEY BUT THERE'S THERE'S TO PROVIDE A WAY HOW COULD THERE BE -- PROVISIONS TO PROTECT THOSE WHEN IT GOES AGAINST FEDERAL LAW THAT'S THE OKAY FIRST QUESTION IS WE'VE NEGOTIATED WITH THE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE. AND AS IT RELATES TO THE STATE'S MONEY WE'VE CHARACTERIZED THAT AS A TRUST FOR THE STATE'S MONEY SO THE STATE OWNS A PIECE OF THAT MONEY BECAUSE THE TAX REVENUE. SO WHAT WE DID WAS WE SAID THAT THAT MONEY WE WROTE THE PROVISIONS TO PROTECT THE STATE'S INTERESTS RIGHT AND GOVERNMENTS INTERESTS SO AT LEAST. OF THE MONEY THAT'S THERE LET'S ASSUME IS A HUNDRED THOUSAND LET'S ASSUME TWENTY THOUSAND OF ITS STATE STUFF WE SOUGHT TO PROTECT THAT THAT IS NOT THE THE THERE MONEY IT BELONGS TO THE STATES THAT'S A PIECE SECOND PIECE. IS THAT'S WHAT'S INSURANCE IS ABOUT LITERALLY THE INSURANCE INTERESTS OF EXPENSIVE I MEAN IN COLORADO THESE YOU KNOW SOME PEOPLE HAVE PHONY BANK ACCOUNTS RIGHT THE USE MANAGEMENT COMPANIES THESE ARE FRIENDS CREDIT CARD. ACCOUNTS THEY TRY. TO BASICALLY JIMMY AROUND TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO AVOID THE CASH THING BUT NONE OF IT'S LEGAL IT'S REALLY CHALLENGING. WE LOOK AT A WASHINGTON AT AT AT AT AT AT AT COLORADO AT SOME OF THE STATES THE WORKING ON THESE THINGS. AND IT'S GOING TO BE EXPENSIVE I MEAN YOUR INSURANCE MAYBE TWO THREE THOUSAND FOUR THOUSAND A MONTH THE HOLD THE ACCOUNT. PLUS YOU COULD BE TWO THREE THOUSAND A MONTH TO KEEP THE ACCOUNT SO AND THEN YOU COULD CRUSH A HUNDRED DOLLARS A CHECK. SO YOU'RE PAYING YOUR FEET COULD BE SEVEN EIGHT THOUSAND A MONTH -- TO HOLD A CHECKING ACCOUNT BUT THAT'S LESS THAN ALL THE OTHER INSURANCES AND EXPENSES YOU'RE SPENDING TO BE ABLE -- TO MANAGE THAT CASH AND ARE THEY REQUIRED. BY THE INSURANCE YES. YES IN THE FIELD. YES. AND THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER DAVE JONES -- STARTED OPENING UP -- YOU KNOW DIFFERENT TYPES OF INSURANCE -- TO TO HELP THESE BUSINESSES. HI ALL FIRST LET ME THANK YOU SENATOR HER TO BERGEN ENTREGAR MALL FOR THIS MEASURE BEFORE'S. BUT AS WE'VE HEARD IT'S NOT. A PERFECT SYSTEM FAR FROM IT. AND WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS. THE NEED TO ALLEVIATE HANDLING CASH BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY. YOUR DEPOSITORY IF IT'S NOT THIS INSTITUTION WILL STILL BE HANDLING CASH JUST AS THE STATE HANDLES CASH ON A DAILY BASIS SO. I JUST NEED TO UNDERSTAND IF WE CAN DO IT AS A STATE ENTITY. WE GO AND DEPOSIT THAT MONEY WHICH WE RECEIVE VERSES TO SCRIPT OR CASH INTO. THE STATE. COUNT WHICH WILL BE CASH WHY CAN'T INDIVIDU BUSINESS OPERATORS DO THE SAME BECAUSE IN ESSENCE. WERE DEPOSITING THE SAME SCHEDULE ONE MONEY THAT'S SUPPOSED TO BE. SUPPOSEDLY IS ILLEGAL. GOOD QUESTION THAT WAS MY QUESTION FIVE YEARS AGO AT A HEARING AND I SAID WHY DOES THE STATE. BOARD OF EQUALIZATION -- WHY ARE THEY ALLOWED TO EVEN DEPOSIT THE CASH WELL THE ANSWER IS IT'S CO MINGLED? SO IT'S NOT STRICTLY CANNABIS IT COULD BE OTHER CASH PAYING BUSINESSES AND THEREFORE WE CAN TAKE THE CASH AND THEN DEPOSITED IN BANK OF AMERICA. BUT IF YOU WANT TO DEPOSIT AND BANK OF AMERICA THAT IS ILLEGAL. I WOULD BE BUSINESS OPERATOR AND I HAD MULTIPLE BUSINESSES WHY COULDN'T I TOO COLD MINGLE MY DEPOSIT -- YOU COULD GO TO YOUR BANK BUT IF YOUR BANK ASKS YOU. WHERE IS THE MONEY FOMIN YOU LET THEM KNOW THEY MAY SHUT DOWN YOUR ACCOUNT ALL OF YOUR ACCOUNTS IN AND THAT'S WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THEY WOULDN'T SH SHUT DOWN THE STATE TO COUNT? AS WELL. I I DON'T WANT TO SAY WHAT I NORMALLY SAY ABOUT THE STATE BUT YES AND WE EVEN TRIED TO HAVE OUR STATE EMPLOYEES SIT AT THE BANK. BANK OF AMERICA IS OUR OFFICIAL BANK SIT THERE WITH THE COMPUTER THAT LOGS YOU WIN AND THEN WE JUST HAVE. BANK AMERICA TELLER. YOU KNOW COUNT ALL THE MONEY GIVE US A RECEIPT AND HAVE SOMEONE LOG BACK IN AND THEY SAID THAT THAT WAS NOT LEGAL WE HAD TO TAKE THE MONEY IN OUR OWN. BUILDING. COUNTS IT HOLD IT AND THEN DEPOSITED TO BACK AMERICA AND THAT WAS LEGAL. DON'T ASK ME. THANK YOU. US SINNERS BERG WOULD TALK TO CLOSE. AS THEY SAY AND YET A SHELL FTEN CORP THE END OF ALL YOUR HEAD I MEAN IT'S A LITTLE CRAZY IT'S HARD I MEAN. IT'S REALLY HARD. YEAH A LOT OF A GIVEN THE DICTIONARY IT'S IT'S HARD. I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO YOU KNOW INITIALLY THE THING THAT MOTIVATED ME IN IN THE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE TREASURE. IS IS THAT. YOU KNOW THAT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AT AND THE TREASURE THE TIME ONE TO A STATE BANK AND I FIGURED THAT TIME IT'S A GOOD WORK OUT A STATE BANK. YOU KNOW W. B. SMOKING MARIJUANA ANYMORE AND ANYWHERE WE CRAZY IT JUST WOULDN'T WORK TAKE FOREVER THIS WAS OKAY HOW COULD YOU ADOPT AN EXISTING SYSTEM AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE GET AS MUCH. AS A DIMENSION I WANTED MORE LIMITED IN CONVERSATION THE TREASURE SHE CAME WITH A RENTED SOME OTHER IDEAS ON WHAT A GREAT IDEA. YOU KNOW AND TRY TO MANAGE IT I THINK IT IF THIS THING WORKS IN THE NEAR TERM AND WE OPEN SOME OF THESE THINGS YOU'LL SEE SOME PEOPLE COME UP WITH CREATIVE IDEAS. OF CREDIT CARDS WITHIN THE BANKING SYSTEM AND SOME OTHER STUFF BUT RIGHT NOW WE WANT TO KEEP IT IS LIVE IT IS POSSIBLE. AT THE END AND TO TRY TO AT LEAST GET SOME MONEY OFF THE STREET AND SAW SOME DISCIPLINE AND SOME RECORD KEEPING IN THE PROCESS AND SOME MORE MONEY. INTO THE STATE AND LOCAL COFFERS FOR ALL THESE TAXES TO BE PAID. THANK YOU THE BILL HAS BEEN MOVED BY SENATOR CAFIERO.
