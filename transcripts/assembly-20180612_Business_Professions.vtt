00:57:00.583 --> 00:57:01.484
ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION IS NOT

00:57:01.551 --> 00:57:02.719
WITH THE SPUR.

00:57:02.786 --> 00:57:04.154
BUT INCIDENTS.

00:57:04.220 --> 00:57:04.754
THAT.

00:57:04.821 --> 00:57:06.923
STARTED THIS PROCESS THANK YOU

00:57:06.990 --> 00:57:09.159
I APPRECIATE THAT BACKGROUND AND

00:57:09.225 --> 00:57:11.094
THEN TO THE OPPOSITION. OF I

00:57:11.161 --> 00:57:14.497
MADE THE A COUPLE QUESTIONS THE.

00:57:14.564 --> 00:57:15.965
THE REASONABLY PRUDENT STANDARD

00:57:16.032 --> 00:57:17.801
IS COMMON IN THE LAW.

00:57:17.867 --> 00:57:18.935
MEAN THAT THAT'S WHAT YOU HAVE

00:57:19.002 --> 00:57:20.503
IS A STANDARD FOR DETERMINING IF

00:57:20.570 --> 00:57:22.238
REASONABLE APPROPRIATE ACTION

00:57:22.305 --> 00:57:23.439
WAS TAKEN A SPECIAL AND SOME HAS

00:57:23.506 --> 00:57:25.942
A DUTY OF CARE. AND I DO BELIEVE

00:57:26.009 --> 00:57:26.810
I'LL BE SURPRISED IF YOU WOULD

00:57:26.876 --> 00:57:27.877
DENY THAT HOME INSPECTORS A DUTY

00:57:27.944 --> 00:57:29.479
OF CARE.

00:57:29.546 --> 00:57:31.414
SO I'M AYE AYE.

00:57:31.481 --> 00:57:32.615
MORE OF A STATE I DON'T FIND

00:57:32.682 --> 00:57:34.250
PERSUASIVE THAT GOSH WE BE

00:57:34.317 --> 00:57:35.285
SUBJECT TO THE REASONABLY

00:57:35.351 --> 00:57:36.686
PRUDENT PERSON THEIR LOT WORSE

00:57:36.753 --> 00:57:38.721
STANDARDS AND THIS IS. FRANKLY

00:57:38.788 --> 00:57:40.123
THE STANDARD THAT IS SO COMMON

00:57:40.190 --> 00:57:41.891
BECAUSE IT IS REASONABLE IT

00:57:41.958 --> 00:57:43.259
ALLOWS A JURY IN A FAX SITUATION

00:57:43.326 --> 00:57:44.761
TO.

00:57:44.828 --> 00:57:47.530
TO DETERMINE UNDER THOSE FACTS

00:57:47.597 --> 00:57:49.265
SO I AM NOT CLEAR AT ALL ON WHY

00:57:49.332 --> 00:57:50.633
THAT IS SUCH A PROBLEM TO BE

00:57:50.700 --> 00:57:52.001
HELD TO THE SAME STANDARD THAT

00:57:52.068 --> 00:57:53.536
WE WOULD WANT ANYONE.

00:57:53.603 --> 00:57:54.904
WHO HAS A DUTY OF CARE CONTACT

00:57:54.971 --> 00:57:56.506
TO HAVE?

00:57:56.573 --> 00:57:59.209
AS PISSED A STRICT LIABILITY

00:57:59.275 --> 00:58:00.877
FOR EXAMPLE. CAN WHAT'S THE

00:58:00.944 --> 00:58:01.845
PROBLEM WITH A REASONABLY

00:58:01.911 --> 00:58:03.546
PRUDENT BEHAVIOR ON THE PART OF

00:58:03.613 --> 00:58:06.616
HOME INSPECTORS.

00:58:06.683 --> 00:58:08.384
THE SHOWS WERE SPECIFICALLY

00:58:08.451 --> 00:58:10.453
REQUIRED TO DO THIS.

00:58:10.520 --> 00:58:13.189
DONE IT AND.

00:58:13.256 --> 00:58:14.757
WE HAVE IN THE IN THE BNP CODE

00:58:14.824 --> 00:58:16.826
ALREADY WE HAVE A LIABILITY.

00:58:16.893 --> 00:58:19.429
AREA A RESPONSIBILITY TO ACT AS

00:58:19.495 --> 00:58:20.697
YOU SAID WE HAVE A

00:58:20.763 --> 00:58:21.764
RESPONSIBILITY REPORT ON

00:58:21.831 --> 00:58:23.132
MATERIAL DEFECTS THAT INVOLVE

00:58:23.199 --> 00:58:24.267
SAFETY AT.

00:58:24.334 --> 00:58:26.469
HABITABILITY DESIRABILITY AND

00:58:26.536 --> 00:58:27.770
VALUE OF THE PROPERTY.

00:58:27.837 --> 00:58:30.473
THIS IS SIMPLY ONE MORE SYSTEM

00:58:30.540 --> 00:58:32.208
MY POINT IS SIMPLY THAT.

00:58:32.275 --> 00:58:34.077
EVEN THE PEOPLE THAT WRITE THE

00:58:34.143 --> 00:58:36.079
ELECTRIC CODE. HAVE SAID THERE'S

00:58:36.145 --> 00:58:38.081
NO PROOF THAT SAYS THAT MOVING

00:58:38.147 --> 00:58:40.383
THE BONDING JUMPER FROM ONE

00:58:40.450 --> 00:58:42.185
PLACE ON THE SYSTEM TO ANOTHER

00:58:42.252 --> 00:58:44.387
DOES ANYTHING FOR SAFETY.

00:58:44.454 --> 00:58:45.188
AND.

00:58:45.288 --> 00:58:47.423
.

00:58:47.490 --> 00:58:49.259
RIGHT BY BASICALLY ADDING US TO

00:58:49.325 --> 00:58:50.727
THE LIST OF PEOPLE.

00:58:50.793 --> 00:58:51.794
THAN.

00:58:51.861 --> 00:58:54.631
IT IF IT DOES I THINK ALATORRE

00:58:54.697 --> 00:58:55.932
LIABILITY BECAUSE WE HAVE A

00:58:55.999 --> 00:58:57.634
SPECIFIC RESPONSIBILITY TO

00:58:57.700 --> 00:58:59.269
BEHAVE IN A SPECIFIC WAY. AND IF

00:58:59.335 --> 00:59:01.504
SOMEBODY CAN MAKE A CASE THAT

00:59:01.571 --> 00:59:02.972
FOR SOME REASON THAT WE SHOULD

00:59:03.039 --> 00:59:04.307
HAVE BEEN VISIBLE.

00:59:04.374 --> 00:59:07.110
THEN DENTAL WORK OR IN THE DEAL

00:59:07.176 --> 00:59:08.544
CAP AND THAT'S THAT'S WHAT THE

00:59:08.611 --> 00:59:10.580
FACT QUESTION ISN'T AND AT. THAT

00:59:10.647 --> 00:59:12.649
HAVE A JURY OR JUDGE YOU HAVE TO

00:59:12.715 --> 00:59:13.349
DECIDE.

00:59:13.416 --> 00:59:13.950
SO IT SOUNDS LIKE.

00:59:14.017 --> 00:59:15.752
YOU'RE.

00:59:15.818 --> 00:59:17.520
ISSUE IS POTENTIALLY ALSO WITH

00:59:17.587 --> 00:59:19.789
THE ACTUAL STATEMENT SO WOULD

00:59:19.856 --> 00:59:21.257
YOU FIND IS EITHER SOMEBODY'S

00:59:21.324 --> 00:59:22.592
GONNA MOVE INTO A HOME. OR

00:59:22.659 --> 00:59:24.227
PURCHASE A HOME IT USEFUL TO

00:59:24.294 --> 00:59:27.096
KNOW IF IT HAS CSSD.

00:59:27.163 --> 00:59:28.564
BUT IT MAY LEAVE LEAVE ASIDE THE

00:59:28.631 --> 00:59:30.033
STATEMENT THAT'S IN THE BILL

00:59:30.099 --> 00:59:31.334
THAT THAT MAY BE THAT YOU KNOW

00:59:31.401 --> 00:59:33.102
MANUFACTURERS THINK THIS IS THE

00:59:33.169 --> 00:59:34.170
WAY YOU SHOULD DO IT YOU. WOULD
