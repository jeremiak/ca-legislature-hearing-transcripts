THIS BUDGET INCLUDES A MULTI

00:57:32.415 --> 00:57:33.783

ACTION FOR WILDFIRE PREVENTION.

00:57:52.669 --> 00:57:55.705
CERTAINLY THAT I THINK FOR US

00:57:55.772 --> 00:57:57.440
TO HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN THE I

00:57:57.507 --> 00:57:58.474
WON'T SPEAK FOR THE OTHER

MEMBERS A LET THEM SPEAK FOR

00:57:59.475 --> 00:58:00.877
THEMSELVES BUT- I THINK THERE

00:58:00.944 --> 00:58:02.278
HAVE BEEN A NAME FROM WHAT I'VE

00:58:02.345 --> 00:58:04.247
HEARD FROM THEM. THAT THEY THE

00:58:04.314 --> 00:58:06.249
KEY COMPONENT OF THIS STRATEGY

00:58:06.316 --> 00:58:08.017
TO PREVENT WILDFIRES IS A

00:58:08.084 --> 00:58:09.986
SUSTAINABLE AND CONTINUOUS

WE'RE TRYING TO GET AT IS THAT

00:58:14.624 --> 00:58:16.759
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE NUMBERS

00:58:16.826 --> 00:58:17.994
FROM BUDGET YEAR TO BUDGET YEAR.

00:58:18.061 --> 00:58:19.362
EITHER CHANGES OR THERE TO BE

00:58:19.429 --> 00:58:20.663
TO BE DETERMINED AND I THINK

00:58:20.730 --> 00:58:21.397
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I'M

00:58:21.464 --> 00:58:25.301
TRYING TO. TO DELVE INTO- WHEN

00:58:25.368 --> 00:58:26.803

ISN'T A SPECIFIC APPROPRIATION

01:01:28.918 --> 01:01:30.653
FOR WATER STORAGE. HOWEVER ALL

EXPENDED YET BUT ARE IN THE

01:01:53.443 --> 01:01:55.411
PROCESS. SURE AND I AND I THINK

01:01:55.478 --> 01:01:58.448
THAT'S THE- PROBLEMATIC FOR

01:01:58.514 --> 01:01:59.949
MYSELF REVERTING THE CENTRAL

01:02:00.016 --> 01:02:01.884

01:02:17.433 --> 01:02:19.068
GUESS IS THE ADMINISTRATION'S

01:02:19.135 --> 01:02:21.871
SUPPORT OF USING SOME OF THAT

01:02:21.938 --> 01:02:28.311
MONEY FOR WATER STORAGE. YEAH I

01:02:28.377 --> 01:02:29.145

DETERMINED AND FUTURE TRAILER

01:07:03.018 --> 01:07:04.720
BILL LANGUAGE I THINK THAT'S I

01:07:04.787 --> 01:07:06.789
THINK A REOCCURRING THEME IN

01:07:06.856 --> 01:07:09.258
THIS AGREEMENT I THINK THAT'S

01:07:09.325 --> 01:07:09.892
THE CHALLENGE RIGHT NOW IS THAT

01:07:09.959 --> 01:07:13.529
WE HAVE. SOME SIGNIFICANT STAY

01:07:13.596 --> 01:07:16.165
PRIORITIES WHEN IT COMES TO.

01:07:16.232 --> 01:07:17.166
HELPING OUR SMALL BUSINESSES

01:07:17.233 --> 01:07:19.969
WITH WITH YOU AE- AND- FUND

01:07:20.035 --> 01:07:21.704
DEBT PAYMENTS AND THAT'S NOT

01:07:21.771 --> 01:07:24.039
HAPPENING AND THEN WE HAVE. A

01:07:24.106 --> 01:07:26.242
LOT OF- ACTUALLY A LACK OF

01:07:26.308 --> 01:07:27.443
CLARITY WHEN IT COMES TO WATER

01:07:27.510 --> 01:07:29.178
STORAGE WHICH I THINK HAS TO BE

01:07:29.245 --> 01:07:30.746
PART OF THE SOLUTION. IF WE'RE

01:07:30.813 --> 01:07:32.782
GOING TO PREPARE FOR DROUGHTS.

01:07:32.848 --> 01:07:35.284
IN THE FUTURE- AND WE NEED TO

01:07:35.351 --> 01:07:35.851
LEARN OUR LESSONS IN THAT

01:07:35.918 --> 01:07:37.887
MISSUS OPPORTUNITY AND OF

01:07:37.953 --> 01:07:39.221
COURSE WITH WHEN IT COMES TO

01:07:39.288 --> 01:07:41.023
YOU. BOB I PREVENTION THIS IS

01:07:41.090 --> 01:07:43.492
SOMETHING THAT- CLEARLY AS WE

01:07:43.559 --> 01:07:46.729
DO AS WE GO WE'RE GOING INTO A-

01:07:46.796 --> 01:07:48.364
A WILDFIRE SEASON THAT COULD BE

01:07:48.431 --> 01:07:49.965
VERY VERY CATASTROPHIC. I DON'T

01:07:50.032 --> 01:07:51.333
QUITE UNDERSTAND WHY THE

01:07:51.400 --> 01:07:55.171
NUMBERS KEEP FLUCTUATING- SO- I

01:07:55.237 --> 01:07:57.973
DO APPRECIATE- YOU PROVIDING

01:07:58.040 --> 01:08:00.109
THE ALLEYS SOME ANSWERS EVEN

01:08:00.176 --> 01:08:00.676
THOUGH I DON'T THINK THAT'S

01:08:00.743 --> 01:08:02.645
VERY CLEAR BUT- IT'S SOMETHING

01:08:02.711 --> 01:08:03.646
I THINK WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE

01:08:03.712 --> 01:08:07.082
TO FOCUS ON- AND I AND- YOU

01:08:07.149 --> 01:08:09.018
KNOW I CERTAINLY HAVE SOME

01:08:09.084 --> 01:08:10.920
SERIOUS RESERVATIONS- MOVING

01:08:10.986 --> 01:08:13.122
FORWARD BUT- I WANT TO THANK

01:08:13.189 --> 01:08:13.722
THE CHAIR FOR THE OPPORTUNITY.

01:08:13.789 --> 01:08:17.726
THANK YOU. THANK YOU GOING BACK

01:08:17.793 --> 01:08:18.894
TO COMMITTEE ANY OTHER

01:08:18.961 --> 01:08:25.468
QUESTIONS MR CARTER. YEAH ON

01:08:25.534 --> 01:08:28.237
THE AB IS PIGGY BACKING A

01:08:28.304 --> 01:08:30.306
LITTLE BIT ON. THE VICE

01:08:30.372 --> 01:08:32.374
CHAIRMAN'S COMMENTS ON THE AND

01:08:32.441 --> 01:08:33.943
QUESTIONS ON THE WILDFIRE

01:08:34.009 --> 01:08:36.445
PREVENTION FRONT I THINK IT'S

01:08:36.512 --> 01:08:39.081
IMPORTANT TO DISTINGUISH- A

01:08:39.148 --> 01:08:41.784
WILDFIRE PREPAREDNESS. FROM

01:08:41.851 --> 01:08:44.320
WILDFIRE PREVENTION THOSE ARE

01:08:44.386 --> 01:08:47.389
TWO DIFFERENT THINGS- AND

01:08:47.456 --> 01:08:50.693
CERTAINLY HIRING NEW. HIRING

01:08:50.759 --> 01:08:53.295
SEASONAL FIREFIGHTERS EARLIER

01:08:53.362 --> 01:08:55.498
IS A PROVIDE IS A- YOUR

01:08:55.564 --> 01:08:58.167
PREPAREDNESS THING HAVING MORE

01:08:58.234 --> 01:08:59.869
BUT YOU SEEN MONIES IN CALLOW

01:08:59.935 --> 01:09:01.637
YES TO RESPOND TO CATASTROPHIC

01:09:01.704 --> 01:09:04.907
WILDFIRE IS A PREPAREDNESS

01:09:04.974 --> 01:09:07.376
THING BUT IT IS NOT PREVENTION.

01:09:07.443 --> 01:09:08.878
THE ONLY SUREFIRE WAY TO DO

01:09:08.944 --> 01:09:11.413
PREVENTION IS TO REDUCE FUELS

01:09:11.480 --> 01:09:13.482
TO REDUCE FUEL LOADS THROUGH

01:09:13.549 --> 01:09:14.617
ALL THINGS WE TALKED ABOUT THE

01:09:14.683 --> 01:09:16.619
NEED. MANAGEMENT PROCESS

01:09:16.685 --> 01:09:18.787
PRESCRIBED BURNS THAT TYPE OF

01:09:18.854 --> 01:09:21.490
ACTIVITY AND THE FACT OF THE

01:09:21.557 --> 01:09:23.993
MATTER IS IN THIS BUDGET. THOSE

01:09:24.059 --> 01:09:25.794
ACTIVITIES PREVENTION

01:09:25.861 --> 01:09:27.229
ACTIVITIES IT'S TWO HUNDRED

01:09:27.296 --> 01:09:28.430
FIFTY EIGHT MILLION. IS NOT A

01:09:28.497 --> 01:09:30.533
BILLION LIKE THE GOVERNOR SAID

01:09:30.599 --> 01:09:32.268
AT THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR.

01:09:32.334 --> 01:09:34.136
IT'S NOT TWO BILLION LIKE HE

01:09:34.203 --> 01:09:37.740
SAID IN MAY. IS TWO HUNDRED

01:09:37.806 --> 01:09:38.841
FIFTY EIGHT MILLION THAT'S

01:09:38.908 --> 01:09:40.009
WHAT'S IN THIS BUDGET THAT

01:09:40.075 --> 01:09:40.876
WE'RE GOING TO BE VOTED ON

01:09:40.943 --> 01:09:42.545
TODAY IT'S TO ME IT'S NOT

01:09:42.611 --> 01:09:47.550
SUFFICIENT- AND THEN IT'S FIVE

01:09:47.616 --> 01:09:50.019
HUNDRED MILLION MAYBE. IN SOME

01:09:50.085 --> 01:09:52.955
FUTURE BUDGET YEAR. THAT THAT'S

01:09:53.022 --> 01:09:55.257
WHAT IT IS OKAY AND SO MY

01:09:55.324 --> 01:09:56.959
QUESTION A D. O. F. IN THIS IS

01:09:57.026 --> 01:09:59.094
REALLY SIMPLE WHY NOT DO A

01:09:59.161 --> 01:10:00.496
CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATION WE DO

01:10:00.563 --> 01:10:01.897
HAVE A WAY OF. MAKING A

01:10:01.964 --> 01:10:06.802
COMMITMENT TO SUSTAIN FUNDING

01:10:06.869 --> 01:10:08.804
DO A CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATION

01:10:08.871 --> 01:10:10.339
OF TWO HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT IF

01:10:10.406 --> 01:10:11.840
YOU LET'S SAY TWO HUNDRED FIFTY

01:10:11.907 --> 01:10:12.441
EIGHT MILLION THAT'S WHAT'S IN

01:10:12.508 --> 01:10:14.743
THIS BUDGET. FIVE YEAR

01:10:14.810 --> 01:10:17.446
CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATION OF TWO

01:10:17.513 --> 01:10:18.080
HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT MILLION WHY

01:10:18.147 --> 01:10:19.582
NOT DO. CONTINUOUS

01:10:19.648 --> 01:10:20.950
APPROPRIATION WHY ISN'T THAT

01:10:21.016 --> 01:10:22.518
THE APPROACH WHY ISN'T THAT

01:10:22.585 --> 01:10:26.755
BEFORE US TODAY. I'M CURRENTLY

01:10:26.822 --> 01:10:27.923
WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE

01:10:27.990 --> 01:10:29.091
AND I'LL TURN THIS QUESTION

01:10:29.158 --> 01:10:30.326
OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE IN A

01:10:30.392 --> 01:10:31.694
MOMENT BUT AGAIN JUST WANT TO

01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:33.562
POINT OUT THE FACT THAT THE ONE

01:10:33.629 --> 01:10:34.763
BILLION THAT WAS INCLUDED IN

01:10:34.830 --> 01:10:36.432
THE MAY REVISION WAS REALLY A

01:10:36.498 --> 01:10:41.170
MULTI YEAR- EFFORT- AND- THE

01:10:41.236 --> 01:10:43.405
SAME WITH US. SEVEN HUNDRED

01:10:43.472 --> 01:10:43.939
FIFTY EIGHT MILLION OVER

01:10:44.006 --> 01:10:46.141
MULTIPLE YEARS- TWO HUNDRED

01:10:46.208 --> 01:10:47.409
FIFTY EIGHT IN BUDGET YEAR- IN

01:10:47.476 --> 01:10:49.044
REGARDS TO A COMMITMENT WE HAVE

01:10:49.111 --> 01:10:50.346
BUILT IN THAT FIVE HUNDRED

01:10:50.412 --> 01:10:51.413
MILLION OBVIOUSLY THINGS MAY

01:10:51.480 --> 01:10:52.948
CHANGE IN THE FUTURE. BUT THE

01:10:53.015 --> 01:10:55.918
COMMITMENT IS TO FIND- IT AND

01:10:55.985 --> 01:10:57.252
MAKE THOSE INVESTMENTS IN IN

01:10:57.319 --> 01:10:58.854
THE- IN THE CURRENT YEAR AS AN

01:10:58.921 --> 01:11:00.356
EARLY ACTION BUDGET YEAR AS

01:11:00.422 --> 01:11:02.257
WELL AS BUDGET YEAR AND BEYOND.

01:11:02.324 --> 01:11:03.826
BUT I WILL. IT'S NOT A

01:11:03.892 --> 01:11:05.060
COMMITTED THOUGH UNLESS IT'S A

01:11:05.127 --> 01:11:07.062
CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATION AND

01:11:07.129 --> 01:11:08.664
RIGHT NOW IT'S NOT SO YOU CAN

01:11:08.731 --> 01:11:09.798
SAVE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION BUT

01:11:09.865 --> 01:11:12.101
THERE'S NO GUARANTEE THAT

01:11:12.167 --> 01:11:13.002
THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. AND

01:11:13.068 --> 01:11:14.503
THAT'S MY UESTION WHY ISN'T IT

01:11:14.570 --> 01:11:15.838
CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATION IF

01:11:15.904 --> 01:11:18.507
THIS IS A PRIORITY. WHY ISN'T A

01:11:18.574 --> 01:11:20.843
CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATIONS. WELL

01:11:20.909 --> 01:11:22.044
AND I WOULD SAY THAT THE BULK

01:11:22.111 --> 01:11:23.712
OF THE ON GOING COMMITMENTS

01:11:23.779 --> 01:11:24.880
THAT WE MAKE IN THE BUDGET ARE

01:11:24.947 --> 01:11:26.415
NOT CONTINUES APPROPRIATIONS

01:11:26.482 --> 01:11:27.716
THEY ARE BILLS IN OUR OUR

01:11:27.783 --> 01:11:29.451
SYSTEM AND THAT IS THAT

01:11:29.518 --> 01:11:31.153
GENERALLY THE TECHNICAL WAY OF

01:11:31.220 --> 01:11:33.989
DOING THAT- I DEFERRED TO

01:11:34.056 --> 01:11:35.758
STEVEN IN REGARDS TO A-

01:11:35.824 --> 01:11:36.925
CONTINUES APPROPRIATION BUT

01:11:36.992 --> 01:11:40.663
THAT IS- MORE. MORE UNUSUAL

01:11:40.729 --> 01:11:44.533
THAN HAVING- BUILT IN- FUNDING

01:11:44.600 --> 01:11:47.503
PER YEAR. STEPHEN VANCE WOULD

01:11:47.569 --> 01:11:48.837
DEPARTMENT FINANCE SO THAT THE

01:11:48.904 --> 01:11:50.572
ONE THING AID START CLARIFYING

01:11:50.639 --> 01:11:52.274
IS THE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY

01:11:52.341 --> 01:11:53.275
EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS IS

01:11:53.342 --> 01:11:56.111
ACTUALLY A ONE TIME. INCREASE

01:11:56.178 --> 01:11:57.246
SO THE AMOUNT THAT'S IN CAL

01:11:57.312 --> 01:11:59.248
FIRE'S BASED BUDGET FOR FIRE

01:11:59.314 --> 01:12:00.416
PREVENTION AND RESOURCE

01:12:00.482 --> 01:12:02.217
MANAGEMENT IS TWO HUNDRED AND

01:12:02.284 --> 01:12:05.154
TWO POINT SIX MILLION. SO THE

01:12:05.220 --> 01:12:05.688
TWO HUNDRED TWO POINT SIX

01:12:05.754 --> 01:12:08.090
MILLION PLUS THE TWO HUNDRED

01:12:08.157 --> 01:12:08.691
FIFTY EIGHT MILLION RESULTS IN

01:12:08.757 --> 01:12:10.225
ABOUT TWENTY. ABOUT FOUR AND

01:12:10.292 --> 01:12:11.994
SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS. IN THE

01:12:12.061 --> 01:12:13.262
CURRENT BUDGET FOR FIRE

01:12:13.328 --> 01:12:14.863
PREVENTION RESOURCE MANAGEMENT

01:12:14.930 --> 01:12:16.398
ACTIVITIES. SO THAT'S WHAT YOU

01:12:16.465 --> 01:12:18.233
HAVE IN THIS BUDGET. AND THEN

01:12:18.300 --> 01:12:19.301
IN TERMS OF THE CONTINUOUS

01:12:19.368 --> 01:12:20.102
PREPARATION- THAT'S THAT'S

01:12:20.169 --> 01:12:21.270
REALLY A BUDGET FRAMEWORK

01:12:21.336 --> 01:12:24.640
DISCUSSION- YEAH EIGHTH AND

01:12:24.707 --> 01:12:26.709
STRUCTURALLY WHO POINTED OUT.

01:12:26.775 --> 01:12:28.544
OUR GENERAL APPROACHES YOU KNOW

01:12:28.610 --> 01:12:29.111
WE MAKE COMMITMENTS FOR ALL

01:12:29.178 --> 01:12:31.513
THESE ONGOING PACKAGES- AND

01:12:31.580 --> 01:12:31.980
THAT'S KIND OF HOW THE

01:12:32.047 --> 01:12:35.584
TECHNICAL SYSTEM WORKS- SO I A

01:12:35.651 --> 01:12:36.552
LOT OF IT IS IT'S ME AGAINST

01:12:36.618 --> 01:12:37.653
BUDGET FRAMEWORK WE HAVE A LOT

01:12:37.720 --> 01:12:40.923
OF ONE TIME. REVENUE SO WE MAKE

01:12:40.989 --> 01:12:41.356
ONE TIME EXPENDITURE

01:12:41.423 --> 01:12:43.292
COMMITMENTS WITH THOSE. NOT

01:12:43.358 --> 01:12:45.494
IT'S NOT NEW BECAUSE SB NINE OH

01:12:45.561 --> 01:12:49.231
ONE. OUTLINED A FIVE YEAR. TWO

01:12:49.298 --> 01:12:50.432
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR

01:12:50.499 --> 01:12:53.302
AT LEAST OUT OF CAP AND TRADE-

01:12:53.368 --> 01:12:54.470
FOR WILDFIRE PREVENTION AND

01:12:54.536 --> 01:12:56.672
AGAIN I MEAN I GUESS. I'M USED

01:12:56.739 --> 01:12:58.607
TO IT YOUR BEFUDDLING THINGS. I

01:12:58.674 --> 01:13:00.843
MEAN YOUR BASE BUDGET FOR CAL

01:13:00.909 --> 01:13:02.211
FIRE IS NOT WILDFIRE

01:13:02.277 --> 01:13:04.313
PREVENTION. ITS OPERATING CAL

01:13:04.379 --> 01:13:06.482
FIGHTER. TO DO THE A TREMENDOUS

01:13:06.548 --> 01:13:07.850
JOB THAT THEY DO EVERY YEAR.

01:13:07.916 --> 01:13:10.452
FIGHTING FIRES AND PROTECTING

01:13:10.519 --> 01:13:11.587
US BUT THAT'S NOT PREVENTION.

01:13:11.653 --> 01:13:13.622
OKAY THE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY

01:13:13.689 --> 01:13:14.189
EIGHT MILLION IS WHAT'S IN

01:13:14.256 --> 01:13:15.390
THERE FOR PREVENTION. ALL

01:13:15.457 --> 01:13:16.859
RIGHT. AND I'M JUST SAYING IT

01:13:16.925 --> 01:13:17.726
SHOULD BE A CONTINUOUS

01:13:17.793 --> 01:13:20.028
APPROPRIATION. YOU GUYS ARE

01:13:20.095 --> 01:13:22.498
WILLING TO DO THAT. YOU COULD.

01:13:22.564 --> 01:13:23.432
BUT YOU'RE NOTWILLING TO DO

01:13:23.499 --> 01:13:25.067
THAT WHICH WHICH IS TROUBLING

01:13:25.134 --> 01:13:26.502
TO PEOPLE LIKE ME WHO DON'T

01:13:26.568 --> 01:13:28.470
WANT HAVE TO FIGHT EVERY YEAR.

01:13:28.537 --> 01:13:30.272
TO GET MONEY IN THIS BUDGET.

01:13:30.339 --> 01:13:31.640
FOR PREVENTION THAT NEEDS TO BE

01:13:31.707 --> 01:13:33.475
JUST AUTOMATIC OKAY THAT'S MY

01:13:33.542 --> 01:13:35.944
POINT. BUT LET'S GET TO THE

01:13:36.011 --> 01:13:36.845
SECOND QUESTION WHICH I THINK

01:13:36.912 --> 01:13:38.514
IS MORE IMPORTANT. THE NPR

01:13:38.580 --> 01:13:40.349
ARTICLE THAT CAME OUT OUTLINED

01:13:40.415 --> 01:13:41.917
HOW THIS JOB ISN'T GETTING DONE

01:13:41.984 --> 01:13:43.352
EVEN WITH THE MONEY THAT THE

01:13:43.418 --> 01:13:45.354
ADMINISTRATION IS. YET AND THAT

01:13:45.420 --> 01:13:47.356
THAT IS BEING. ALLOCATED BY THE

01:13:47.422 --> 01:13:48.857
LEGISLATURE AND SUPPOSED TO BE

01:13:48.924 --> 01:13:51.827
EXECUTED BY THE EXECUTIVE. TO

01:13:51.894 --> 01:13:53.829
GET THIS WORK DONE YOU TOUTED

01:13:53.896 --> 01:13:55.164
ON HOW MANY HOW MUCH ACREAGE

YOU'RE DOING NINETY THOUSAND.

01:13:56.932 --> 01:13:58.767
ACRES ACTUALLY WAS ONLY ELEVEN

01:13:58.834 --> 01:14:00.669
THOUSAND. SO WHAT IS GOING TO

01:14:00.736 --> 01:14:02.437
BE WHAT ALONG WITH THIS MONEY

01:14:02.504 --> 01:14:03.772
NOW THAT WE'RE ALLOCATING TWO

01:14:03.839 --> 01:14:04.673
HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT MILLION.

01:14:04.740 --> 01:14:06.542
HOW ARE YOU GOING TO ENSURE.

01:14:06.608 --> 01:14:09.077

DONE ACTUALLY. IS COMPLETED.

01:14:11.146 --> 01:14:12.714
AND THAT WE'RE NOT JUST HOW THE

01:14:12.781 --> 01:14:16.518
NUMBERS THAT ARE REAL. AS A

01:14:16.585 --> 01:14:18.787
POINT OF CLARIFICATION-

01:14:18.854 --> 01:14:20.689
CALIFORNIA'S ENTIRE BASE BUDGET

01:14:20.756 --> 01:14:22.357
IS NOT FIRE SUPPRESSION- IT'S

01:14:22.424 --> 01:14:25.260
NOT IT THERE IS A BASE BUDGET.

01:14:25.327 --> 01:14:26.862
THAT CALIFORNIA HAS FOR FIRE

01:14:26.929 --> 01:14:30.098
PREVENTION. AND MUCH OF THAT IS

01:14:30.165 --> 01:14:32.201
THE- RECENT YEARS HAS BEEN THE

01:14:32.267 --> 01:14:32.968
TWENTY MILLION THAT CAME FROM

01:14:33.035 --> 01:14:34.703
SB NINE A ONE BUT AS NOTED

01:14:34.770 --> 01:14:36.738
EARLIER A HUNDRED AND TWENTY

01:14:36.805 --> 01:14:38.373
FIVE MILLION OF THE ASK YOU

01:14:38.440 --> 01:14:40.542
KNOW NO ONE FUNDING. IS NOT YET

01:14:40.609 --> 01:14:42.878
IN THIS BUDGET BECAUSE THE CAP

01:14:42.945 --> 01:14:44.179
AND TRADE PLAN IS STILL GETTING

01:14:44.246 --> 01:14:46.481
FINALIZED SO THE TWO HUNDRED

01:14:46.548 --> 01:14:47.249
AND TWO POINT SIX MILLION THAT

01:14:47.316 --> 01:14:50.352
I CITED INCLUDES ABOUT SEVENTY

01:14:50.419 --> 01:14:52.020
FIVE MILLION OF THAT TWO

01:14:52.087 --> 01:14:53.222
HUNDRED MILLION BUT THE REST OF

01:14:53.288 --> 01:14:55.257
THAT IS BASED BUDGET IN

01:14:55.324 --> 01:14:57.259
CALIFORNIA'S BUDGET. FOR FIRE

01:14:57.326 --> 01:15:01.997
PREVENTION. IN TERMS OF. WORK

01:15:02.064 --> 01:15:03.932
GETTING DONE SO MY

01:15:03.999 --> 01:15:05.801
UNDERSTANDING IS CALIFORNIA IS

01:15:05.868 --> 01:15:08.203
AS CAL FIRE REPORTS TO US THE

01:15:08.270 --> 01:15:10.038
NINETY MILLION ERROR THE NINETY

01:15:10.105 --> 01:15:11.940
THOUSAND ACRE HI NUMBER WAS THE

01:15:12.007 --> 01:15:13.175
AMOUNT OF ACREAGE THAT WAS

01:15:13.242 --> 01:15:16.745
BEING. PROTECTED BY THE THIRTY

01:15:16.812 --> 01:15:17.613
FIVE PRIORITY PROJECTS THAT

01:15:17.679 --> 01:15:19.681
WERE DONE I IN MY UNDERSTANDING

01:15:19.748 --> 01:15:21.683
AGAIN AS CALIFORNIA REPORTS TO

01:15:21.750 --> 01:15:23.518
US WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT FUEL

01:15:23.585 --> 01:15:25.120
BREAKS IT'S NOT UNCOMMON BOTH

01:15:25.187 --> 01:15:26.655
TALK ABOUT TERMS OF ACREAGE

01:15:26.722 --> 01:15:27.656
PROTECTED AS WELL AS A

01:15:27.723 --> 01:15:29.458
CHRISTIAN. SO I THINK WHAT YOU

01:15:29.524 --> 01:15:30.425
HAVE THERE IS TWO DIFFERENT

01:15:30.492 --> 01:15:33.128
NUMBERS THAT ONE IS A GREAT

01:15:33.195 --> 01:15:33.762
STREET AND THE OTHER IS A CREEK

01:15:33.829 --> 01:15:38.100
PROTECTED. OR YOU CERTAINLY

01:15:38.166 --> 01:15:39.401
WERE TELLING THE PUBLIC THAT

01:15:39.468 --> 01:15:40.469
YOU WERE DOING A LOT MORE THAN

01:15:40.535 --> 01:15:42.771
WAS ACTUALLY DONE AND THAT'S

01:15:42.838 --> 01:15:43.939
THE POINT IS WE WANT TO ENSURE

01:15:44.006 --> 01:15:45.073
THAT THERE ARE TEETH THAT HAVE

01:15:45.140 --> 01:15:46.541
WE'RE GONNA ALLOCATE MONEY TO

01:15:46.608 --> 01:15:48.243
SOMETHING THAT WE WANT TO MAKE

01:15:48.310 --> 01:15:50.012
SURE THAT ACTUALLY GETS TO THE

01:15:50.078 --> 01:15:52.748
OBJECTIVE OF TREATING THE ACRES

01:15:52.814 --> 01:15:54.583
THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. AND

01:15:54.650 --> 01:15:55.651
THAT'S NOT EVEN GETTING TO

01:15:55.717 --> 01:15:57.286
WHERE EVERYBODY TALKS TO

01:15:57.352 --> 01:15:58.754
EVERYBODY EVERYBODY AGREES THAT

01:15:58.820 --> 01:16:00.722
WE NEED TO BE DOING FIVE

01:16:00.789 --> 01:16:02.925
HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES. A YEAR

01:16:02.991 --> 01:16:04.559
IF WE WANT TO GET ON TOP OF

01:16:04.626 --> 01:16:06.595
THIS PROBLEM. ASSEMBLY WAS

01:16:06.662 --> 01:16:08.430
MICHAEL LARA WAS QUOTED IN THAT

01:16:08.497 --> 01:16:10.599
FROM STANFORD THIS YEAR ONE OF

01:16:10.666 --> 01:16:11.934
THE LEADING EXPERTS ON THIS

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:13.602
THAT YOU NEED TO BE DOING FIVE

01:16:13.669 --> 01:16:15.804
HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES AND YOU

01:16:15.871 --> 01:16:17.339
WEREN'T EVEN DOING NINETY. SO

01:16:17.406 --> 01:16:19.141
THAT'S A PROBLEM AND I WANT TO

01:16:19.207 --> 01:16:19.741
ENSURE THAT WE'RE GONNA

01:16:19.808 --> 01:16:21.376
ALLOCATE RESOURCES THAT WE THAT

01:16:21.443 --> 01:16:23.745
WE NEED TO BE DOING. THEY ALSO

01:16:23.812 --> 01:16:25.180
SPEAKS TO IF WE NEED TO BE

01:16:25.247 --> 01:16:26.415
DOING MORE THAN THEY WISH TO DO

01:16:26.481 --> 01:16:28.450
A CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATION TO

01:16:28.517 --> 01:16:29.217
MAKE SURE THEY'RE SUSTAIN

01:16:29.284 --> 01:16:31.153
FUNDING FOR IT. SALAS AND WITH

01:16:31.219 --> 01:16:32.521
THAT I MEAN IT EBBS VERY

01:16:32.587 --> 01:16:34.790
PROBLEMATIC TO ME. THAT WE

01:16:34.856 --> 01:16:35.390
DON'T HAVE CONTINUOUS

01:16:35.457 --> 01:16:37.993
APPROPRIATION- INSURING A

01:16:38.060 --> 01:16:40.529
SUSTAINED FUNDING SOURCE FOR

01:16:40.595 --> 01:16:44.399
WILDFIRE PREVENTION. THANK YOU

01:16:44.466 --> 01:16:46.768

01:16:46.835 --> 01:16:49.771
THANK YOU I WANTED TO FOLLOW

01:17:11.093 --> 01:17:13.261
THAT- ALTHOUGH THERE IS A

01:17:13.328 --> 01:17:16.598
SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF FUNDING-

01:17:16.665 --> 01:17:17.399
BUT FORWARD IN THIS BUDGET

01:17:17.466 --> 01:17:19.835
THERE ARE. PRIORITIES FOR THE

01:17:19.901 --> 01:17:21.770
USE OF OUR FUNDS AS WELL AS

01:17:36.551 --> 01:17:38.553
LOWER THAN THEY WERE. IN THE

01:17:38.620 --> 01:17:40.589
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WHICH WAS UP

01:17:40.655 --> 01:17:41.323

FOOD OR THE FEDERAL TAX-

01:17:47.095 --> 01:17:48.130
INCREASES THAT WILL OCCUR

01:17:48.196 --> 01:17:49.765
BUSINESSES WILL NOT OCCUR FOR
