DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH EARLY ON

00:53:42.052 --> 00:53:44.554
THERE WAS A FOCUS ON SOCIAL

TO REALLY UNDERSTAND THAT WE

00:54:14.985 --> 00:54:16.753

00:54:31.401 --> 00:54:37.707
RANGE OF- OUTCOMES. ON AND- I'M

00:54:37.774 --> 00:54:39.776

HOME FOR BIGELOW ALL RIGHT. SO

00:56:02.025 --> 00:56:04.961
LET ME TALK ABOUT HOW I SEE THE

00:56:05.028 --> 00:56:08.231
CULTURE OF RACISM IN AMERICA. SO

00:56:08.298 --> 00:56:10.200
I AM AN EXPERT IT EATING GUMBO

00:56:10.266 --> 00:56:12.736

00:56:12.802 --> 00:56:15.205
MAKING UP IT WAS MY WIFE THE

00:56:15.271 --> 00:56:17.741
INTRODUCED ME TO GUMBO AND IF

00:56:17.807 --> 00:56:18.942
ANYBODY KNOWS ANYTHING ABOUT

00:56:19.008 --> 00:56:20.777
GUMBEL IS LOOKS DIFFERENT IN

00:56:20.844 --> 00:56:22.078
TASTE DIFFERENT DEPENDING UPON

00:56:22.145 --> 00:56:24.013
WHO'S MAKING IT AND WHAT PART OF

00:56:24.080 --> 00:56:25.215
THE COUNTRY. I THINK IT'S THE

00:56:25.281 --> 00:56:27.717
SAME THING WITH RACE AND RACES

00:56:27.784 --> 00:56:30.019
IN THE INGREDIENTS FOR BUMBLE IS

00:56:30.086 --> 00:56:32.288
ROOT VEGETABLES SAUSAGE CHICKEN

SEAFOOD IF YOU LAY POWDER

00:56:34.023 --> 00:56:35.759
DEPENDING UPON WHO'S MAKING IT

00:56:35.825 --> 00:56:37.227
WHAT PART OF THE COUNTRY SOME OF

00:56:37.293 --> 00:56:39.362
THAT HAS A LOT A LOT OF- TOMATO

00:56:39.429 --> 00:56:41.364
BASIC CETERA. WHAT IS THE

00:56:41.431 --> 00:56:43.700
INGREDIENTS TO THE CULTURE

00:56:43.767 --> 00:56:45.935
RACISM IN AMERICA IT INCLUDES

00:56:46.002 --> 00:56:48.972
THE ISN'T A COLUMN RACISM SEXISM

00:56:49.038 --> 00:56:50.907
CLASSISM AND COLORIST. AND I

00:56:50.974 --> 00:56:52.642
MENTION COLORISM BECAUSE NO

00:56:52.709 --> 00:56:53.977
MATTER WHAT ETHNICITY YOU

00:56:54.043 --> 00:56:55.278
TALKING ABOUT THERE IS

00:56:55.345 --> 00:56:57.347
DISCRIMINATION IN HEALTH

00:56:57.413 --> 00:57:01.017
OUTCOMES DIFFERENCE. BASED UPON

00:57:01.084 --> 00:57:02.118
YOUR SKIN COLOR. THEY WE MIX AND

00:57:02.185 --> 00:57:04.921
YOU KNOW. HUGE DOSE OF IGNORE

00:57:04.988 --> 00:57:07.290

DOGMA AND WE HAVE INGREDIENTS

00:57:09.993 --> 00:57:12.128
FOR AMERICAN CULTURE BREAKS IT'S

00:57:12.195 --> 00:57:13.797
EXPRESSED IN FELT DIFFERENTLY

00:57:13.863 --> 00:57:17.300
DONE SELF ON THE WEST EASE. BUT

00:57:17.367 --> 00:57:20.003
IT'S ALL GONE. SO LET'S TALK

00:57:20.069 --> 00:57:21.337
ABOUT THE PAST HOW DID ALL THIS

00:57:21.404 --> 00:57:25.208
COME ABOUT. WELL IF WE GO BACK

00:57:25.275 --> 00:57:26.843
CENTURIES IN THE SEVENTEEN

00:57:26.910 --> 00:57:28.545
HUNDREDS AND EIGHTEEN HUNDREDS

00:57:28.611 --> 00:57:29.946
THERE WAS A GENTLEMAN BY THE

00:57:30.013 --> 00:57:31.247

00:57:31.314 --> 00:57:32.816
CONSIDERED ONE OF THE FATHERS

00:57:32.882 --> 00:57:35.952
OF- OF PALEONTOLOGY. AND HE

00:57:36.019 --> 00:57:40.490
TAUGHT IN THE SCIENCE THAT ON.

00:57:40.557 --> 00:57:43.827
WHITES AND BLACKS WERE DIFFERENT

00:57:43.893 --> 00:57:45.795
IN THAT THERE WAS A HIERARCHY

00:57:45.862 --> 00:57:47.630
THAT WHITES WERE ON TOP FOLLOWED

00:57:47.697 --> 00:57:50.433
BY BLACKS FOLLOWED BY EIGHT. AND

00:57:50.500 --> 00:57:51.434
THEN YOU COULD MEASURE THE

00:57:51.501 --> 00:57:53.369
FACIAL ANGLE IN THE SCOPE

00:57:53.436 --> 00:57:56.973
CAPACITY. AND WROTE ATREUS IS

00:57:57.040 --> 00:57:59.576
CALLED THE NATURAL ORDER OF

00:57:59.642 --> 00:58:02.979
HUMAN BEANS DEEMING WHITE

00:58:03.046 --> 00:58:05.281
SUPERIA FOLLOWED BY BLACKS THE

00:58:05.348 --> 00:58:06.783
BEGINNING OF DEHUMANISATION SO

00:58:06.850 --> 00:58:09.252
WE TALK ABOUT RACISM BUT IT'S

00:58:09.319 --> 00:58:10.820
REALLY DEHUMANISATION. THERE WAS

00:58:10.887 --> 00:58:12.822
A PHYSICIAN BY THE NAME GEORGE

00:58:12.889 --> 00:58:15.758
KOFI WHO IS A FRENCH WAS ISSUED

00:58:15.825 --> 00:58:17.260
IN PARIS WHO TAUGHT MANY.

00:58:17.327 --> 00:58:18.862
AMERICAN PHYSICIANS HERE IN THIS

00:58:18.928 --> 00:58:21.931
COUNTRY AND NOT COOPERATING- WAS

00:58:21.998 --> 00:58:25.235
INVOLVED IN FOLLOWING A AFRICAN

NAME WAS TO TEACH APARTMENT PART

00:58:33.076 --> 00:58:34.978
OF THE COCHON TRY. AND HE WAS

00:58:35.044 --> 00:58:36.379
TRYING TO PROVE THAT HER BODY

00:58:36.446 --> 00:58:40.650
HABITAT. WAS INFERIOR IN CLOSE

00:58:40.717 --> 00:58:41.951
TO EIGHT HE FOLLOWED HER AROUND

00:58:42.018 --> 00:58:44.187
UNTIL SHE DIED. TOOK A BODY PART

00:58:44.254 --> 00:58:45.822
TO PUT HIM ON DISPLAY IN THE

RETURNS TO GET A PROPER BURIAL.

00:58:59.435 --> 00:59:01.838
WE HAVE DOCTOR SAM PART RIGHT

00:59:01.905 --> 00:59:03.439
BUT SAM CARTWRIGHT WAS A

00:59:03.506 --> 00:59:05.008
GRADUATE OF THE UNIVERSITY OF

00:59:05.074 --> 00:59:06.409
PENNSYLVANIA WHICH WAS THE FIRST

00:59:06.476 --> 00:59:07.744
MEDICAL SCHOOL IN THIS COUNTRY

00:59:07.810 --> 00:59:09.279
EVEN BEFORE HARVEY VERY

00:59:09.345 --> 00:59:11.681
PRESTIGIOUS. HE ARE GRADUATED

00:59:11.748 --> 00:59:13.349
FROM THE ANY WENT TO A SCHOOL

00:59:13.416 --> 00:59:18.521
DOWN IN. NEW WALLETS IN UGH IN

DEPARTMENT AT THE UNIVERSITY OF

00:59:25.995 --> 00:59:28.531
LOUISIANA. SO BLACK FOLKS WERE

00:59:28.598 --> 00:59:30.433
SPECIALTY NOW DURING THIS TIME

00:59:30.500 --> 00:59:32.001
THEY WERE SLAVES AND THEY WERE

00:59:32.068 --> 00:59:33.870
TREATED AS PROPERTY. THE SLAVE

00:59:33.937 --> 00:59:35.338
OWNERS WERE HAVING A PROBLEM

00:59:35.405 --> 00:59:36.906
BECAUSE THEY WERE RUNNING AWAY.

00:59:36.973 --> 00:59:38.474
THEY WENT TO THE UNIVERSITY HE

00:59:38.541 --> 00:59:40.977
DID A STUDY. TO FIND OUT WHY

00:59:41.044 --> 00:59:42.979
THAT WAS HAPPENING HE WROTE AN

00:59:43.046 --> 00:59:44.314
ARTICLE IN THE BOSE MEDICAL

00:59:44.380 --> 00:59:46.449
JOURNAL DECLARING THAT THE

00:59:46.516 --> 00:59:47.684
REASON WHY THEY WERE RUNNING

00:59:47.750 --> 00:59:49.485
AWAY IS BECAUSE THEY SUFFERED

00:59:49.552 --> 00:59:51.220
WITH THEM MENTAL DISEASE CALLED

00:59:51.287 --> 00:59:54.490
DRAKE DAMANIA RUN AWAY MATT. AND

00:59:54.557 --> 00:59:56.559
WHEN THIS LEYVA SAID YEAH BUT- I

00:59:56.626 --> 00:59:57.927
HIT THE TREATMENT WAS

00:59:57.994 --> 01:00:00.830
CONDESCENSION HIM A LITTLE TIME

01:00:00.897 --> 01:00:02.865
OFF DANCE ON SUNDAYS. AND

01:00:02.932 --> 01:00:04.167
INSPIRED TO DO AND THAT SOME OF

01:00:04.233 --> 01:00:05.435
THEM STILL RAN AWAY AND HE SAID

01:00:05.501 --> 01:00:08.237
A HA THOSE SLAVES HAVE ANOTHER

01:00:08.304 --> 01:00:10.540
MENTAL PROBLEM CALLED JUSTICE

01:00:10.606 --> 01:00:13.376
DIGIT AETHIOPICA. REBELLIOUSNESS

01:00:13.443 --> 01:00:15.645
NOW TOOK ME FIFTY YEARS TO FIND

01:00:15.712 --> 01:00:17.246
OUT WHAT I WAS SUFFERING FROM.

01:00:17.313 --> 01:00:20.083
BUT THE TREATMENT FOR THAT WAS

01:00:20.149 --> 01:00:22.251
MEDICAL WITH THE- HE WITH THE

01:00:22.318 --> 01:00:23.252
DEVIL OUT OF THEM THIS WAS A

01:00:23.319 --> 01:00:25.088
PHYSICIAN AND THAT WAS HIS

01:00:25.154 --> 01:00:27.390
TREATMENT WE HAVE DOCTOR SENT

01:00:27.457 --> 01:00:28.992
SAMUEL MORTON WHO WAS AT THE

01:00:29.058 --> 01:00:31.194
UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA WHO

01:00:31.260 --> 01:00:31.894
TAUGHT THE THEORY OF CRANEY

01:00:31.961 --> 01:00:35.198
OLOGY. IN UP OUR PHRENOLOGY

01:00:35.264 --> 01:00:37.266
MEASURING THE SKULL CAPACITY.

01:00:37.333 --> 01:00:39.302
THE FIRST EUROCENTRIC IQ TEST

01:00:39.369 --> 01:00:41.270
STATING THAT BLACKS WERE

01:00:41.337 --> 01:00:42.638
INFERIOR BECAUSE THEY HAD A

01:00:42.705 --> 01:00:45.074
SMALLER SCOPE CAPACITY THIS IS

01:00:45.141 --> 01:00:47.744
BEING TAUGHT IN THE UCS IN AND A

01:00:47.810 --> 01:00:49.512
MEDICAL SCHOOLS IN THIS COUNTRY.

01:00:49.579 --> 01:00:51.948
WE GOT DR JOSHUA NOT WHO IS ALSO

01:00:52.015 --> 01:00:55.018
A PHYSICIAN. AND LECTURER IN A

01:00:55.084 --> 01:00:57.086
SLAVE OWNER AND HE TAUGHT THE

01:00:57.153 --> 01:00:59.655
THEORY OF RICK WROTE ABOUT

01:00:59.722 --> 01:01:01.724
CALLED NUMEROLOGY IN WHICH SHE

01:01:01.791 --> 01:01:05.228
TAUGHT. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

01:01:05.294 --> 01:01:06.562
BLACKS AND WHITES. IN THE WE

01:01:06.629 --> 01:01:08.831
HAVE. DOCTOR J. MARION SIMS HE'S

01:01:08.898 --> 01:01:09.899
CONSIDERED THE FATHER OF

01:01:09.966 --> 01:01:13.236
GYNECOLOGY. WHO OPERATED ON

01:01:13.302 --> 01:01:15.505
BLACKS AND POOR WHITES TO

01:01:15.571 --> 01:01:17.073
DEVELOP A SURGICAL PROCEDURE

01:01:17.140 --> 01:01:21.344
WITHOUT. THE AID OF ANESTHESIA.

01:01:21.411 --> 01:01:23.379
THESE ARE JUST A FEW THERE WAS A

01:01:23.446 --> 01:01:25.248
BOOK WRITTEN BY HARRIET

01:01:25.314 --> 01:01:27.250
WASHINGTON CALLED MEDICAL

01:01:27.316 --> 01:01:29.886
APARTHEID THAT DOCUMENTED DOZENS

01:01:29.952 --> 01:01:32.355
AND DOZENS OF IN HUMAN

01:01:32.422 --> 01:01:35.058
EXPERIMENTATION. ON BLACKS

01:01:35.124 --> 01:01:37.927
THROUGHOUT SENTRIES SO IT'S NOT

01:01:37.994 --> 01:01:40.997
JUST ABOUT TO SKI IT'S ABOUT A-

01:01:41.064 --> 01:01:44.767
LEGACY AND HISTORY OF-

01:01:44.834 --> 01:01:49.472
EXPERIMENTATION. SO MONDAYS ARE

01:01:49.539 --> 01:01:50.039
IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES AND

01:01:50.106 --> 01:01:53.843
NINETEEN. NINETIES LITERATURE

01:01:53.910 --> 01:01:56.279
STARTED PUBLISHING OUTCOMES THAT

01:01:56.345 --> 01:01:58.381
WOULD BE DIFFERENT FOR BLACKS

01:01:58.448 --> 01:02:00.850
AND HISPANICS. AND THEY USED TO

01:02:00.917 --> 01:02:02.018
SAY WELL WE'RE NOT REALLY SURE

01:02:02.085 --> 01:02:04.120
WHY IT MUST HAVE SOMETHING TO DO

01:02:04.187 --> 01:02:05.154
MAYBE IT HAS TO DO WITH THAT

01:02:05.221 --> 01:02:08.291
GENETICS MAYBE IT HAS TO DO

01:02:08.357 --> 01:02:10.226
WITH- POOR COMMUNICATION. THIS

01:02:10.293 --> 01:02:12.328
WAS A STUDY IN NINETEEN NINETY

01:02:12.395 --> 01:02:13.429
NINE PUBLISHED IN THE NEW

01:02:13.496 --> 01:02:15.098
ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE IN

01:02:15.164 --> 01:02:17.166
WHICH THESE WITH THE ACT WHAT

01:02:17.233 --> 01:02:19.268
ACTUAL PARTICIPANTS THESE WERE

01:02:19.335 --> 01:02:21.404
ALL ACTORS WHO DRESSED UP LIKE

01:02:21.471 --> 01:02:23.773
PATIENTS THEY ALL HAD A SCRIPT

01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:26.342
EXACTLY THE SAME. THOUSANDS OF

01:02:26.409 --> 01:02:28.778
DOCTORS INTERVIEWED THEM AND IN

01:02:28.845 --> 01:02:30.179
THE END I ASKED WHAT IS THE

01:02:30.246 --> 01:02:32.014
DIAGNOSIS PHYSICIANS WELL

01:02:32.081 --> 01:02:33.416
TRAINED IN THIS COUNTRY THEY

01:02:33.483 --> 01:02:34.517
CAME UP WITH THE CORRECT

01:02:34.584 --> 01:02:35.985
DIAGNOSIS CARDIO VASCULAR

01:02:36.052 --> 01:02:38.287
DISEASE THEN THEY ASK WHAT DO

01:02:38.354 --> 01:02:42.825
YOU DO NEXT IN FOR SOME REASON.

01:02:42.892 --> 01:02:44.460
FOR THE BLACK PATIENTS SIXTY

01:02:44.527 --> 01:02:47.263
PERCENT. OF THESE PHYSICIANS

01:02:47.330 --> 01:02:49.532
RECOMMENDED THE PROPER TREATMENT

01:02:49.599 --> 01:02:51.134
LASTS FOR BLACKS THAN FOR

01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:54.270
WHITES. SO THAT PROMPTED. US

01:02:54.337 --> 01:02:55.538
STUDY BY THE INSTITUTE OF

01:02:55.605 --> 01:02:58.107
MEDICINE REPORT THAT CAME OUT IN

01:02:58.174 --> 01:02:59.876
TWO THOUSAND AND TWO. COATS I

01:02:59.942 --> 01:03:01.911
NEED FOR TREATMENT THIS WAS ONE

01:03:01.978 --> 01:03:03.880
OF THE STUDIES THEY LOOKED AT

01:03:03.946 --> 01:03:05.114
TWO HUNDRED TO OTHER STUDIES.

01:03:05.181 --> 01:03:07.350
DOCUMENTING THAT YES I NEED-

01:03:07.416 --> 01:03:09.318
TREATMENT IS TAKING PLACE IN THE

01:03:09.385 --> 01:03:11.220
HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. IN IS

01:03:11.287 --> 01:03:13.723
ACTUALLY BEING IMPLEMENTED BY

01:03:13.789 --> 01:03:16.726
PHYSICIANS. SO WHAT IS THE

01:03:16.792 --> 01:03:20.363
SCIENCE OF RACES. THERE IS A

01:03:20.429 --> 01:03:22.365
VIDEO THAT GOES WITH THIS I'M

01:03:22.431 --> 01:03:24.033
NOT GOING TO SHOW YOU ONE

01:03:24.100 --> 01:03:25.301
INTERNET THIS CALL CREATORS FOR

01:03:25.368 --> 01:03:27.870
CHANGE BUT THEY TALK ABOUT THE

01:03:27.937 --> 01:03:31.107
SIDE TO RACES. IN ORDER TO

01:03:31.174 --> 01:03:32.642
UNDERSTAND DECIDES WE HAVE TO

01:03:32.708 --> 01:03:35.144
UNDERSTAND COLLECTED TRUMP. WHAT

01:03:35.211 --> 01:03:36.245
IS COLLECTIVE TRAUMA IT'S A

01:03:36.312 --> 01:03:38.381
COMBINATION OF ETHNO HISTORIC

01:03:38.447 --> 01:03:40.416
TRAUMAS SUCH AS THAT SEEN WITH

01:03:40.483 --> 01:03:42.318
BLACKS IN SLAVERY NATIVE

01:03:42.385 --> 01:03:44.954
AMERICANS WITH GENOCIDE. THE

01:03:45.021 --> 01:03:46.956
HOLOCAUST X. CENTER MIX THAT

01:03:47.023 --> 01:03:49.125
WITH INTERGENERATIONAL RACISM

01:03:49.192 --> 01:03:51.294
AND CULTURAL DISCRIMINATION. AND

01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:53.329
THE SCIENCE CONCEPT OF

01:03:53.396 --> 01:03:56.432
EPIGENETICS WHICH IS BIOLOGY IN

01:03:56.499 --> 01:03:58.301
A MIXING WITH ENVIRONMENT THAT

01:03:58.367 --> 01:04:00.336
EXPRESSES JIM DIFFERENTLY AND WE

01:04:00.403 --> 01:04:02.471
WIND UP WITH MULTI GENERATIONAL

01:04:02.538 --> 01:04:04.707
SOCIAL INEQUITIES IN HEALTH

01:04:04.774 --> 01:04:07.076
DISPARITIES. HOW IS THAT

01:04:07.143 --> 01:04:09.712
MANIFEST PAST AND CURRENT EVENTS

01:04:09.779 --> 01:04:11.280
THAT INCREASE- INDIVIDUAL

01:04:11.347 --> 01:04:14.217
COLLECTIVE TOXIC STRESS OF

01:04:14.283 --> 01:04:18.554
CAUSING A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS-

01:04:18.621 --> 01:04:21.891
IN THE BEGINNING. I DON'T KNOW

01:04:21.958 --> 01:04:23.226
IF I WAS ABLE TO SHOW THE

01:04:23.292 --> 01:04:24.860
ORIGINAL SLIDE BUT IN JANUARY OF

01:04:24.927 --> 01:04:28.864
THIS YEAR. THE SAN DIEGO BOARD

01:04:28.931 --> 01:04:31.200
OF SUPERVISORS DECLARED RACISM A

01:04:31.267 --> 01:04:34.036
PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS HERE IN-

01:04:34.103 --> 01:04:38.107
SAN DIEGO. ONE RESEARCH IS IN

01:04:38.174 --> 01:04:40.209
THIS AREAS DR DAVID WILLIAMS

01:04:40.276 --> 01:04:42.178
HE'S AT THE HARVARD SCHOOL OF

01:04:42.245 --> 01:04:43.179
PUBLIC HEALTH HUNDREDS OF

01:04:43.246 --> 01:04:44.847
ARTICLES HE'S PUBLISHED IN THIS

01:04:44.914 --> 01:04:46.983
IS JUST ONE HE PUBLISHED TALKING

01:04:47.049 --> 01:04:49.285
ABOUT STRESS PATHWAYS THAT CAUSE

01:04:49.352 --> 01:04:50.987
DISCRIMINATION AND AFFECT YOUR

01:04:51.053 --> 01:04:53.956
HEALTH. ANY TALK ABOUT FIRST

01:04:54.023 --> 01:04:55.992
EXPOSURE TO STRESS GIVES RISE TO

01:04:56.058 --> 01:04:57.226
NEGATIVE EMOTIONAL STATES

01:04:57.293 --> 01:04:58.361
GENERATING PSYCHOLOGICAL

01:04:58.427 --> 01:05:00.930
DISTRESS ADVERSELY AFFECT HEALTH

01:05:00.997 --> 01:05:04.967
SUCH AS DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY.

01:05:05.034 --> 01:05:06.168
AND THEN BEHAVIORAL COPING

01:05:06.235 --> 01:05:08.037
RESPONSES TO MANAGE STRESS

01:05:08.104 --> 01:05:09.338
LEADING TO UNHEALTHY BEHAVIORS

01:05:09.405 --> 01:05:11.073
SUCH AS- DRUGS CIGARETTES

01:05:11.140 --> 01:05:13.442
ALCOHOL ABUSE AND POOR LIFESTYLE

01:05:13.509 --> 01:05:16.045
HABITS. IN THIRD THE

01:05:16.112 --> 01:05:17.280
PSYCHOLOGICAL AND BEHAVIORAL

01:05:17.346 --> 01:05:19.048
RESPONSES TO CHRONIC STRESS CAN

01:05:19.115 --> 01:05:21.651
LEAD TO PSYCHOLOGICAL SYSTEM

01:05:21.717 --> 01:05:24.120
CHANGES PHYSIOLOGICAL CHANGES

01:05:24.186 --> 01:05:28.324
THAT CAN CAUSE DISEASE. I'M

01:05:28.391 --> 01:05:30.626
GONNA TALK BRIEFLY ABOUT TO

01:05:30.693 --> 01:05:32.995
CONCEPTS ONE IS AT THE BOTTOM

01:05:33.062 --> 01:05:35.064
ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES

01:05:35.131 --> 01:05:36.999
CALLED ACES AND THE OTHERS OUR

01:05:37.066 --> 01:05:39.035
STATIC GLOW WHICH TO CHRONIC

01:05:39.101 --> 01:05:41.871
PHYSIOLOGICAL RESPONSE THAT YOUR

01:05:41.937 --> 01:05:43.739
BODY HAS TO LESS STRESS. AND

01:05:43.806 --> 01:05:45.308
WHEN THEY HAVE DONE STUDIES

01:05:45.374 --> 01:05:48.878
THEY'RE NOW FINDING OUT THAT ONE

01:05:48.944 --> 01:05:52.315
OF THE FIRST- STUDIES OF ACES

01:05:52.381 --> 01:05:54.717
WAS ACTUALLY DONE HERE IN. SAN

01:05:54.784 --> 01:05:57.186
DIEGO AND THEY FOUND THAT THE

01:05:57.253 --> 01:05:59.689
MORE ADVERSE EVENT YOU HAD TO

01:05:59.755 --> 01:06:02.158
OUR CHILDHOOD. THE GREATER

NUMBER OF DISEASES YOU HAD WHEN

01:06:04.460 --> 01:06:06.295
YOU OWED INCLUDING DIABETES AS

01:06:06.362 --> 01:06:08.397
MERRICK CETERA. THEY LOOKED AT

01:06:08.464 --> 01:06:10.199
IT BY RACE AND ETHNICITY BLACKS

01:06:10.266 --> 01:06:12.902
HISPANICS HAVE HIGH SCORES IN

01:06:12.968 --> 01:06:14.837
HIGH ALLOSTERIC LOAD LEVELS THEN

01:06:14.904 --> 01:06:16.305
ALL OF THE ETHNICITIES THIS

01:06:16.372 --> 01:06:18.274
CONTRIBUTES TEXAS DISEASE BURDEN

01:06:18.341 --> 01:06:20.343
SHORTER LIFE EXPECTANCIES SIX

01:06:20.409 --> 01:06:24.280
CETERA. THIS IS JUST. AN EXAMPLE

01:06:24.347 --> 01:06:26.882
OF WHAT THIS STUDY SHOWED THAT

01:06:26.949 --> 01:06:28.084
DEPENDED UPON THE NUMBER OF

01:06:28.150 --> 01:06:31.153
FACES AND YOU GO ACROSS ONE TWO

01:06:31.220 --> 01:06:32.755
THREE FOUR ACES YOU CAN SEE THE

01:06:32.822 --> 01:06:36.892
EXPONENTIAL INCREASE. IN THE-

01:06:36.959 --> 01:06:38.994
NUMBER OF EVENTS THAT HAPPEN

01:06:39.061 --> 01:06:41.163
LATER ON IT LIKE SUICIDE

01:06:47.103 --> 01:06:50.373
X. CETERA. AND HOW IS POSTULATED

01:06:50.439 --> 01:06:51.974
TO WORK IS THAT THESE ADVERSE

01:06:52.041 --> 01:06:53.809
CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES LEAD TO

01:06:53.876 --> 01:06:55.244

01:07:04.620 --> 01:07:08.958
PROBLEMS AND EARLY DEATH. WHAT

01:07:09.024 --> 01:07:12.027
IS OUR STATIC LOW. I LIST THE

01:07:12.094 --> 01:07:15.464
CONCEPT AVAILABLE SPACES IS HOW

01:07:15.531 --> 01:07:17.800
WE INTERNALIZE OUR ENVIRONMENT.

01:07:17.867 --> 01:07:19.235
WE MEASURE IT BY WHAT WE CALL

01:07:19.301 --> 01:07:22.004
ALICE STATIC. INVESTOR CHRONIC

01:07:22.071 --> 01:07:23.906

01:07:28.377 --> 01:07:30.513
AND AS YOU CAN SEE SOME OF THOSE

01:07:30.579 --> 01:07:33.015
MANY OF THE NEGATIVE SOCIAL

01:07:33.082 --> 01:07:35.117
DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH. INCREASE

01:07:35.184 --> 01:07:37.820
OUR STATIC LOW. VIOLENCE POOR

01:07:40.055 --> 01:07:42.091
FOR EMPLOYMENT POVERTY AND YES

01:07:42.158 --> 01:07:44.927
RACISM. NOW WE TALK ABOUT THE

01:07:44.994 --> 01:07:46.162
SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH

01:07:46.228 --> 01:07:48.297
BUT I'D LIKE TO SUGGEST HERE IN

01:07:48.364 --> 01:07:49.598
AMERICA MANY OF THE SOCIAL

01:07:49.665 --> 01:07:50.800
DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH THE

01:07:50.866 --> 01:07:52.568
RACIALIZED WE GOT STRUCTURAL

01:07:52.635 --> 01:07:55.404
RACIAL RACISM WHICH STRUCTURAL.

01:07:55.471 --> 01:07:57.440
AND RACIALIZED SOCIAL

01:07:57.506 --> 01:08:02.845

01:08:02.912 --> 01:08:04.580
PUBLIC HEALTH LITERATURE IN IN

01:08:04.647 --> 01:08:06.682
THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH LITERATURE

01:08:06.749 --> 01:08:07.249
THERE ARE MANY ARTICLES NOW

01:08:07.316 --> 01:08:09.718
COMING OUT TALKING ABOUT DALLAS

01:08:09.785 --> 01:08:13.289
LOAD AND HOW IT'S MEASURED IN

01:08:13.355 --> 01:08:14.190
TWO THOUSAND AND SIX THIS WAS

01:08:14.256 --> 01:08:15.124
ONE PUBLISHED IN THE JOURNAL OF

01:08:15.191 --> 01:08:16.926
PUBLIC HEALTH. IN WHICH THEY

01:08:16.992 --> 01:08:20.129
MEASURED ALLOSTERIC LOAD ARE NOT

01:08:20.196 --> 01:08:22.965
IN WHITES VERSUS BLACKS SOME OF

01:08:23.032 --> 01:08:25.401
THE PRIMARY STRESS BIOMARKERS

01:08:25.468 --> 01:08:30.239
INCLUDE. ENZYMES AND- PROTEINS

01:08:30.306 --> 01:08:32.842
SEARCHES- CORTISOL CATECHOLAMINE

01:08:32.908 --> 01:08:35.711
ANGIOTENSIN ENDOTHELIUM. AND

01:08:35.778 --> 01:08:37.079
SOME OF THE SECONDARY WAYS YOU

01:08:37.146 --> 01:08:38.581
CAN GET THAT THESE INCREASE

01:08:38.647 --> 01:08:40.549
INSIDES IS MEASURING YOUR BLOOD

01:08:40.616 --> 01:08:43.619
PRESSURE YES GLYCATED HEMOGLOBIN

01:08:43.686 --> 01:08:45.387
WHICH IS A. ONE C. A MEASURE OF

01:08:45.454 --> 01:08:48.457
EARLY DIABETES. LIPID LEVELS

01:08:48.524 --> 01:08:51.460
YOUR WAIST TO HIP RATIO ALBUMIN

01:08:51.527 --> 01:08:54.864
EXETER THESE ALL CLINICAL-

01:08:54.930 --> 01:08:56.799
BIOLOGICAL WAYS OF MEASURING

01:08:56.866 --> 01:08:58.834
ALICE STATIC LOW AND WHEN THEY

01:08:58.901 --> 01:09:00.302
DID THE STUDIES THEY FOUND THAT

01:09:00.369 --> 01:09:02.137
BLACKS AT HIGHER OUT OF A STATIC

01:09:02.204 --> 01:09:03.772
LOAD AND WIPED. AND MORE

01:09:03.839 --> 01:09:05.908
IMPORTANTLY FOR THE BLACK

01:09:05.975 --> 01:09:07.376
POPULATION WHEN THEY LOOK AT

01:09:07.443 --> 01:09:09.144
HISPANICS ASIANS WHITE SIX

01:09:09.211 --> 01:09:11.914
CETERA BLACKS WITH THE ONLY ONES

01:09:11.981 --> 01:09:13.282
TO HAVE BLACK FEMALES HAVE

01:09:13.349 --> 01:09:15.284
HIGHER I WAS STATUS QUO. THE

01:09:15.351 --> 01:09:21.156
BLACK. MALES I WAS THAT. WE LOOK

01:09:21.223 --> 01:09:22.958
AT YOU ESTIMATE IN MATTEL RATES

01:09:23.025 --> 01:09:25.194
BY RACE AND ETHNICITY. WE CAN

01:09:25.261 --> 01:09:27.997
SEE THAT FOR AFRICAN AMERICANS

01:09:28.063 --> 01:09:30.633
MATERNAL RATE IS TWO TO THREE

01:09:30.699 --> 01:09:32.434
SOMETIMES FOUR TIMES HIGHER.

01:09:32.501 --> 01:09:36.972
THAN HISPANIC IN. A WHITE

01:09:37.039 --> 01:09:39.341
POPULATIONS IN THE SAME FOR

01:09:39.408 --> 01:09:42.778
INFANT MORTALITY. AND THIS GOES

01:09:42.845 --> 01:09:47.082
ON YES AS THE- SOCIAL INCOME

01:09:47.149 --> 01:09:49.685
IMPROVES WITH THE JOB STATUS

01:09:49.752 --> 01:09:52.421
IMPROVES. THE INFANT MORTALITY

01:09:52.488 --> 01:09:54.156
AND MATERNAL RATES GO DOWN BUT

01:09:54.223 --> 01:09:56.058
WHEN WE COMPARE BLACKS TO THE

01:09:56.125 --> 01:09:58.827
SAME CLASS WE STILL SEE EVEN IT

01:09:58.894 --> 01:10:01.230
UP INCOME- OF BLACK MOTHERS AND

01:10:01.297 --> 01:10:03.332
WHAT NOT THIS DISPARITIES SO

01:10:03.399 --> 01:10:05.834
RACES INDEPENDENT FACTOR AND I

01:10:05.901 --> 01:10:06.769
THINK IT HAS TO DO WITH THAT

01:10:06.835 --> 01:10:08.737
ALICE STATIC LOAD. IN CHRONIC

01:10:08.804 --> 01:10:11.807
INTERMENT STRESS THAT BLACK

01:10:11.874 --> 01:10:15.244
WOMEN GO THROUGH. HERE IN SAN

01:10:15.311 --> 01:10:19.548
DIEGO COUNTY. NINE TWO ZERO

01:10:19.615 --> 01:10:23.218

ONE FIVE IS HE SAN DIEGO A BABY

01:10:25.087 --> 01:10:28.023
BORN IN THOSE ZIP CODES HAS A

01:10:28.090 --> 01:10:30.693

01:10:30.759 --> 01:10:31.260
EIGHTY FIVE YEARS IN EIGHTY

01:10:31.327 --> 01:10:36.465
YEARS. AT 921-149-2115 IS THE

01:10:36.532 --> 01:10:38.167
AREA WHERE I PRACTICE MEDICINE

01:10:38.233 --> 01:10:40.135
ITSELF THE SAN DIEGO AND THE

01:10:40.202 --> 01:10:41.770
LIFE EXPECTANCY AT BIRTH FOR A

01:10:41.837 --> 01:10:43.906
BABY BORN AND THAT ERROR IS

01:10:43.973 --> 01:10:45.174
SEVENTY NINE AND SEVENTY SEVEN

01:10:45.240 --> 01:10:47.843
YEARS. JUST BECAUSE WHERE YOU

01:10:47.910 --> 01:10:50.312
BELONG SO PLACE. HAS A VERY

01:10:50.379 --> 01:10:56.919
SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTED TO YELP. IF WE LOOK AT RACE. AND

01:10:56.986 --> 01:11:02.358
LONGEVITY THE OVERALL H. OF

01:11:02.424 --> 01:11:03.892
LONGEVITY IN THE UNITED STATES

01:11:03.959 --> 01:11:06.762
AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN TO SEVENTY

01:11:06.829 --> 01:11:08.297
EIGHT POINT SIX HOWEVER IF WE

01:11:08.364 --> 01:11:09.965
LOOK AT ASIANS WHO WAS EIGHTY

01:11:10.032 --> 01:11:12.267
SIX POINT FIVE HISPANICS EIGHTY

01:11:12.334 --> 01:11:14.637
TWO POINT EIGHT WHITE SEVENTY

01:11:14.703 --> 01:11:17.106
EIGHT POINT NINE NATIVE AMERICAN

01:11:17.172 --> 01:11:19.041
SEVENTY SIX POINT NINE IN BLACK

01:11:19.108 --> 01:11:21.877
SEVENTY FOUR POINT SIX SO ALL

01:11:21.944 --> 01:11:23.879
MINORITIES ARE NOT THE SAME SO

01:11:23.946 --> 01:11:25.981
YOU MAY ASK WHY ARE BLACKS AND

01:11:26.048 --> 01:11:28.684
NATIVE AMERICANS HELLO. I WANT

01:11:28.751 --> 01:11:30.352
TO GO BACK TO THAT HISTORY K.

01:11:30.419 --> 01:11:32.821
THAT COLLECTIVE TRAUMA THAT TOOK

01:11:32.888 --> 01:11:35.057
PLACE IT'S PUT THAT TRAUMA IN

01:11:35.124 --> 01:11:36.558
ALICE THAT EXPLODE HAS BEEN

01:11:36.625 --> 01:11:38.327
GOING ON MUCH LONGER IN THOSE

01:11:38.394 --> 01:11:42.097
COMMUNITIES THEN IN THE HISPANIC

01:11:42.164 --> 01:11:43.532
COMMUNITY. WHAT'S TAKING PLACE

01:11:43.599 --> 01:11:45.100
TODAY IN WHAT WE SEE IN THE

01:11:45.167 --> 01:11:46.902
HISPANIC COMMUNITY WE'RE

01:11:46.969 --> 01:11:48.237
BEGINNING TO SEE CHANGES IN

01:11:48.303 --> 01:11:49.705
THOSE NUMBERS IT IS GETTING

01:11:49.772 --> 01:11:51.173
WORSE BECAUSE OF THAT OUT

01:11:51.240 --> 01:11:53.308
NEGATIVE ALLOSTERIC LOW THIS

01:11:53.375 --> 01:11:57.446
TAKING PLACE THERE. IN IN

01:11:57.513 --> 01:12:00.315
SUMMARY HOW DOES THE INTERACTION

01:12:00.382 --> 01:12:00.916
OF GENES AND ENVIRONMENT TAKE

01:12:00.983 --> 01:12:04.119
PLACE. ON ON THE REF WE'RE

01:12:04.186 --> 01:12:05.154
TALKING ABOUT ESTIMATE

01:12:05.220 --> 01:12:07.156
CONTRIBUTION TO DISEASE WE SAY

01:12:07.222 --> 01:12:10.092
ABOUT 25% MAYBE BIOLOGY

01:12:10.159 --> 01:12:12.227
LIFESTYLE GREATER THAN 50%

01:12:12.294 --> 01:12:15.030
ENVIRONMENT 12% IN THE MEDICAL

01:12:15.097 --> 01:12:22.137
CARE 10% SO 10% YET WE SPEND 90%

01:12:22.204 --> 01:12:25.641
OF OUR MONEY ON MEDICAL CARE.

01:12:25.708 --> 01:12:27.810
AND SO WE PROBABLY NEED TO FOCUS

01:12:27.876 --> 01:12:33.515
MORE ON LIFESTYLE. AND LIFESTYLE

01:12:33.582 --> 01:12:37.820
ITSELF. IS INFLUENCED BY OUR

01:12:37.886 --> 01:12:39.288
ENVIRONMENT INTERACTS WITH OUR

01:12:39.354 --> 01:12:42.891
GENES SO IT'S EASY TO SAY FOR

01:12:42.958 --> 01:12:44.159
SOMEBODY IN LA HOYA I WANT YOU

01:12:44.226 --> 01:12:47.629
TO JOG YOU'RE A PERSONAL TRAINER

01:12:47.696 --> 01:12:50.432
- DO TWO LAPS OF SWIMMING VERSES

01:12:50.499 --> 01:12:52.534
ITSELF THE SAN DIEGO IT'S MUCH

01:12:52.601 --> 01:12:54.069
MORE DIFFICULT THE ENVIRONMENT

01:12:54.136 --> 01:12:57.406
NOT MAY NOT BE SAFE SO YOU HAVE

01:12:57.473 --> 01:12:59.975
ENVIRONMENT INFLUENCES ARE YOUR

01:13:00.042 --> 01:13:02.444
ABILITY TO EXECUTE A HEALTHY.

01:13:02.511 --> 01:13:04.179
LIFESTYLE AND THEN YOU THROW THE

01:13:04.246 --> 01:13:07.049
EPIGENETICS IN THERE WHICH IS.

01:13:07.116 --> 01:13:09.685
NOT THAT THERE'S A- NIGGLE GENE

01:13:09.752 --> 01:13:12.821
MAKE IN US HYPERTENSIVE. YES THE

01:13:12.888 --> 01:13:14.757
ENVIRONMENT AND RACISM AND

01:13:14.823 --> 01:13:16.358
STRUCTURAL ISSUES THAT WE'RE

01:13:16.425 --> 01:13:18.794
DEALING WITH. LEADING TO A

01:13:18.861 --> 01:13:20.295
MODIFICATION OF GENE EXPRESSION

01:13:20.362 --> 01:13:22.164
RATHER THAN ALTERATION IN THE

01:13:22.231 --> 01:13:26.835
CODE ITSELF. AND THIS IS JUST TO

01:13:26.902 --> 01:13:28.604
SHOW YOU THE IMPACT OF THE

01:13:28.670 --> 01:13:31.140
SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH.

01:13:31.206 --> 01:13:33.342
THIS IS SAYING THAT IN TWENTY

01:13:33.408 --> 01:13:35.577
NINETEEN. THE LIFE EXPECTANCY OF

01:13:35.644 --> 01:13:37.679
WHITE WAS SEVENTY EIGHT POINT

01:13:37.746 --> 01:13:39.915
EIGHT YEARS HISPANICS EIGHTY ONE

01:13:39.982 --> 01:13:42.017
POINT EIGHT YEARS AND BLACKS

01:13:42.084 --> 01:13:43.452
SEVENTY FOUR POINT FIVE YEARS

01:13:43.519 --> 01:13:46.555
WITH THE ONSET OF CODE VIA I

01:13:46.622 --> 01:13:49.758
THINK THE LIFE EXPECTANCY FOR

01:13:49.825 --> 01:13:50.392
TWENTY TWENTY WAS THE FIRST SIX

01:13:50.459 --> 01:13:51.360
EIGHT MONTHS. THERE WAS A

01:13:51.426 --> 01:13:54.229
DECREASE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN

01:13:54.296 --> 01:13:55.831
DECADES LOCKED THE LIFE

01:13:55.898 --> 01:13:59.234
EXPECTANCY FOR AMERICANS HOWEVER

01:13:59.301 --> 01:14:00.335
THE LOS FOUR WHITES WAS ONLY

01:14:00.402 --> 01:14:02.070
POINT EIGHT YEARS THE LOSS FOR

01:14:02.137 --> 01:14:04.039
HISPANICS WAS ONLY ONE POINT

01:14:04.106 --> 01:14:06.141
NINE YEARS IN THE LOS FOUR

01:14:06.208 --> 01:14:10.412
AFRICAN AMERICANS WAS TWO POINT

01:14:10.479 --> 01:14:13.682
SEVENTY. SO IN SUMMARY. WHY DID

01:14:13.749 --> 01:14:15.417
NOT COUNTY AND OTHER COUNTIES TO

01:14:15.484 --> 01:14:16.785
CLEAR RACISM A PUBLIC HEALTH

01:14:16.852 --> 01:14:19.855
CRISIS. AS A RESULT OF HISTORIC

01:14:19.922 --> 01:14:21.790
AND CURRENT RACISM BIAS

01:14:21.857 --> 01:14:23.358
DISCRIMINATION RACE AND

01:14:23.425 --> 01:14:25.227
ETHNICIT ARE SIGNIFICANT

01:14:25.294 --> 01:14:27.196
CONTRIBUTORS TO MOST OF THE

01:14:27.262 --> 01:14:28.931
SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH

01:14:28.997 --> 01:14:30.632
WHICH INCLUDE STE YOUR

01:14:30.699 --> 01:14:32.568
SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS THAT HELPS

01:36:32.086 --> 01:36:33.554
VERY WELL AND SO I'M NOT GOING

01:36:33.621 --> 01:36:35.189
TO GO INTO THE DIFFERENT

01:36:35.256 --> 01:36:36.590
ELEMENTS OF THE SOCIAL

01:36:36.657 --> 01:36:38.492
DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH. AND WE

01:36:38.559 --> 01:36:39.693
ALL KNOW THAT IT IMPACTS

01:36:39.760 --> 01:36:40.995
RESILIENCY WE KNOW THAT IMPACTS

01:36:41.061 --> 01:36:43.164
HEALTH EQUITY- BUT A PUBLIC

01:36:43.230 --> 01:36:45.299
HEALTH PRACTICE WE GET TO ASK

01:36:45.366 --> 01:36:47.434
THE QUESTIONS OF WHY DO CERTAIN

01:36:47.501 --> 01:36:50.571
HEALTH. OUTCOMES EXIST. AND MORE

01:36:50.638 --> 01:36:51.972
AND THE MORE WE ASKED THAT

01:36:52.039 --> 01:36:53.140
QUESTION THE MORE WE ASK WHY WHY

01:36:53.207 --> 01:36:55.009
WHY AND WE END UP PEELING IT

01:36:55.075 --> 01:36:57.745
BACK TO YOU SOCIAL DETERMINANTS

01:36:57.811 --> 01:36:59.213

STATUS FAMILY SOCIAL SUPPORT THE

01:37:04.385 --> 01:37:04.952
OTHER COMPONENTS THAT WE TALKED

01:37:05.019 --> 01:37:07.688
ABOUT BEFORE. AS WE LOOK AT THE

01:37:07.755 --> 01:37:08.956
EXAMPLES OF SOCIAL DETERMINES OF

01:37:09.023 --> 01:37:10.224
HEALTH WE SEE THAT NOT EVERY

01:37:10.291 --> 01:37:12.026
PERSON HAVE THE SAME CONDITIONS

01:37:12.092 --> 01:37:13.627
AND THESE CONDITIONS EXPLAIN IN

01:37:13.694 --> 01:37:15.429
PART WHY SOME INDIVIDUALS ARE

01:37:15.496 --> 01:37:17.298
HEALTHIER THAN OTHERS AND WHY

01:37:17.364 --> 01:37:19.066
INDIVIDUALS ARE MORE GENERALLY

01:37:19.133 --> 01:37:20.634
ARE NOT AS HEALTHY AS IT COULD

01:37:20.701 --> 01:37:23.337
BE. THE NATURE OF OUR WORK IN

01:37:23.404 --> 01:37:25.239
PUBLIC HEALTH RELIES HEAVILY ON

01:37:25.306 --> 01:37:27.107
SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH.

01:37:27.174 --> 01:37:28.142
MOST OF MY PRESENTATION WILL

01:37:28.209 --> 01:37:30.477
FOCUS ON HOW THE COUNTY USES A

01:37:30.544 --> 01:37:32.913
COLLECTIVE IMPACT APPROACH TO

01:37:34.915 --> 01:37:35.849
DETERMINES OF HEALTH AND

01:37:35.916 --> 01:37:38.052
INCREASE HEALTH AWARENESS. IN

01:37:38.118 --> 01:37:39.553
OUR COMMUNITIES THROUGH A HEALTH

01:37:39.620 --> 01:37:44.959
EQUITY LENS. WE START WITH THE

01:37:45.025 --> 01:37:46.026
THREE FOUR FIFTY MODEL BASED ON

01:37:46.093 --> 01:37:48.128
THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION

01:37:48.195 --> 01:37:48.662
THREE FOUR FIFTY MODEL THE

01:37:48.729 --> 01:37:50.231
COUNTY FOCUSES ON THREE

01:37:50.297 --> 01:37:52.266
BEHAVIORS. THIS INCLUDES POOR

01:37:52.333 --> 01:37:55.035
DIET LACK OF EXERCISING AND

01:37:55.102 --> 01:37:56.637

01:37:56.704 --> 01:37:58.405
THE OTHER SPEAKERSTHAT SOCIAL

01:37:58.472 --> 01:38:00.207
DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH DIRECTLY

01:38:00.274 --> 01:38:01.809
IMPACT THE THREE BEHAVIORS.

01:38:01.875 --> 01:38:03.811
THESE THREE BEHAVIORS LEAD TO

01:38:03.877 --> 01:38:06.080
FOR CHRONIC DISEASES CANCER

01:38:06.146 --> 01:38:07.414
HEART DISEASE STROKE TYPE TWO

01:38:07.481 --> 01:38:10.351
DIABETES AND LUNG DISEASE WHICH

01:38:10.417 --> 01:38:12.152
CONTRIBUTE TO MORE THAN HALF OF

01:38:12.219 --> 01:38:14.088
THE DEATHS IN SAN DIEGO EACH

01:38:14.154 --> 01:38:17.925
YEAR. CHRONIC DISEASES MAKE UP

01:38:17.992 --> 01:38:20.094
THE EIGHT OF THE TEN LEADING

01:38:20.160 --> 01:38:21.095
CAUSES OF DEATH IN SAN DIEGO

01:38:21.161 --> 01:38:25.266
COUNTY IN FACT IN THE YEAR OF

01:38:25.332 --> 01:38:26.900
200063% OF DEATHS IN SAN DIEGO

01:38:26.967 --> 01:38:30.070
COUNTY WERE DUE TO THESE FOR

01:38:30.137 --> 01:38:32.006
CHRONIC DISEASES. IF YOU LOOK

01:38:32.072 --> 01:38:34.074
SPECIFICALLY AT THE SEVENTY NINE

01:38:34.141 --> 01:38:35.175
ASSEMBLY DISTRICT WHICH INCLUDES

01:38:35.242 --> 01:38:36.844
PARTS OF CENTRAL SOUTHEAST AND

01:38:36.910 --> 01:38:38.979
NORTH CENTRAL REGIONS. THESE

01:38:39.046 --> 01:38:40.347
REGIONS HAVE SIMILAR PERCENTAGES

01:38:40.414 --> 01:38:42.916
IN TERMS OF DEATH WITH THE

01:38:42.983 --> 01:38:44.985
EXCEPTION OF SOUTH REGION. IN

DUE TO THESE CHRONIC DISEASES.

01:38:50.357 --> 01:38:51.325
MEANING THAT IN THE YEAR TWO

01:38:51.392 --> 01:38:53.961

01:39:56.156 --> 01:39:58.692
IS THE USER SELECTS A HEALTH

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT DISCHARGES.

01:40:30.357 --> 01:40:32.826
THE LIGHT BLUE SHOWS LOWER RATES

01:40:32.893 --> 01:40:34.261
FOLLOWED BY DARKER AREAS FOR

01:40:34.328 --> 01:40:37.931
HIGHER RATES. HERE CENTRAL AND

01:40:37.998 --> 01:40:39.400
EAST REGIONS HAVE THE HIGHEST

01:40:39.466 --> 01:40:44.371

01:40:44.438 --> 01:40:46.907
OF ANOTHER CONDITION CHRONIC

SHOW THE HIGH STREET FOLLOWED BY

01:40:53.380 --> 01:40:57.050
CENTRAL. THIS SYSTEM ALLOWS US

01:40:57.117 --> 01:40:59.186
TO DO A DEEPER DIVE ON ANY

DEEPER DIVE IN CENTRAL REGION

01:41:05.192 --> 01:41:06.894
AND WE CAN SEE THAT SOUTHEASTERN

01:41:06.960 --> 01:41:08.929
SAN DIEGO HAS THE HIGHEST RATE

01:41:08.996 --> 01:41:12.099
AMONG THE SUBREGIONAL AREAS IN

SHARED EARLIER WE CAN ALSO

01:41:18.439 --> 01:41:20.240
FILTER THE DATA BY GENDER THIS

01:41:20.307 --> 01:41:22.075

LENSES OF HEALTH EQUITY. BASED

01:41:52.573 --> 01:41:54.074
ON THIS DATA WE CAN SEE THAT

01:41:54.141 --> 01:41:56.143
UNCONTROLLED ASTHMA RATES ARE

01:41:56.210 --> 01:41:57.811
HIGHEST AMONG AFRICAN AMERICAN

THEM ABOUT HEALTHY EATING AND

01:56:02.255 --> 01:56:03.389

TEACHING THEM ABOUT THE DANGERS

01:56:08.561 --> 01:56:12.065
OF TOBACCO AND ALCOHOL THAT THEY
