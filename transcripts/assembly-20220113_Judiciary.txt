SPECIFICALLY THIS BILL ALLOWS THE NOTARY PUBLIC TO REGISTER WITH THE SECRETARY OF STATE TO PROVIDE ONLINE NOTARIZATION CLARIFIED IN ONLINE NOTE REPUBLIC MUST QUALIFY AS A TRADITIONAL NOTARY UNDER EXISTING LAW REQUIRES SECRETARY ACT BY JULY ONE TWENTY TWENTY THREE AS SPECIFIES THIS RULEMAKING PROCESS MUST ADDRESS ISSUES SUCH AS ELECTRONIC JOURNALS RETENTION AND STORAGE OF RECORDS SCRUTINY AND ENCRYPTION AND FEES THAT MAY BE CHARGED BY AN ONLINE NOTARY PUBLIC AND IT ONLINE NOTARY PLATFORM AMONG OTHERS INSUREDS COLLABORATION BY REQUIRING THE SECRETARY OF STATE THE CONSIDERED ABUSE OF STATE ENTITIES DEPARTMENTS AGENCIES AND THE PUBLIC AND DEVELOPING THE RULES.

OF OUR NOTARY SYSTEM FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS I'VE LEARNED HOW VITAL ACCESS TO NOTARIES CARBON DAY LIFE AND IT'S SUCH A NOTE SERVICES NOTARY PUBLICS PERFORM DURING THE PANDEMIC DESPONDENT CRISIS HAS HAS HIGHLIGHTED THE NEED FOR MORE CONVENIENT ALTERNATIVE FOR BOTH THOSE ACCESSING NOTARY. SERVICES AND NOTARIES OF THE SELVES COMMITTEE ON A PERSONAL NOTE DURING THE PANDEMIC MY OWN. WAS IN THE OFF. AND HE BEEN SUSPENDED ADDED TO RESEARCH PROBLEM. SHE WANTED TO LIVING TRY. BUT BECAUSE THE RULES OF THE HOSPITAL DOOR KOBE WE COULDN'T BRING A NOTARY A WITNESS FAMILY MEMBERS ALL LET AT THE SAME TIME. IT BECAME VERY DIFFICULT FOR US BECAUSE SHE WANTED TO GET IT DONE BECAUSE YOU WEREN'T SURE IF SHE WOULD SURVIVE.

THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE WE WILL GO MORE LINES IN QUEUE AT THIS TIME I THINK WHAT THE LINE THIRTY THREE. HI GOOD MORNING ANNA BACK ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS- WE HAVE CONCERNS WITH THE BILL AS IT STANDS- ESPECIALLY WITH REGARD TO ALLOW THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION AND- WE- ARE. CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUES THAT MAY ARISE BY- NOT ALLOWING- NOTARIZATION- HERE IN CALIFORNIA TO BE AUTHORIZED- THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. WHERE OF LINE TWENTY SIX GO AHEAD PLEASE. GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS THANK YOU ANTHONY HELTON WITH THE CALIFORNIA PLANT BUT BASS AND I WOULD JUST LIKE TO ECHO THE CONCERNS- STATED HERE BY- MY COLLEAGUES- PARTICULARLY WITH REGARD TO THE INTERSTATE RECOGNITION OF PROVISIONS WITHIN THE BILL- BUT ALSO WOULD LIKE TO- REITERATE- TO START OUR GRATITUDE THAT THE- YOU KNOW FOR THE WORK THAT YOU COMMITTEE AND THAT COMMITTEE STAFF INSURANCE. AND AUTHOR OF PUT INTO THE- THIS BILL SO FAR THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO WILL CONTINUE UNLESS YOU'RE A- SORRY ARE THERE MORE BECAUSE WE'RE NOT GONNA TAKE ANY DISCHARGED AS ELEVEN JUST AN INDICATION OF. SUPPORT FORCE SORRY INDICATION OF OPPOSITION OR CONCERNS. MR GERETS MIKE BULLARD I'M SORRY I MISSED BY A QUEUE THERE AND I THOUGHT I MIGHT SPEAK FOR JUST A MOMENT IF I COULD. MISTER BELOW ALL RIGHT BEHALF OF A LARGE COALITION OF BUSINESS GROUPS INCLUDING MORTGAGE BANKERS AND CREDIT UNIONS REALTORS LAND TITLE NOTARY PLATFORMS INCLUDING NOTARIZED AND DOCUSIGN THAT OUR CLIENTS THE NATIONAL NOTARY ASSOCIATION AND CALIFORNIA HAS GROWN SO CA CAN. WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK BRIEFLY AND REALLY WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE AND ESPECIALLY MISTER MAGNATES AND PURCHASED A HUGE AMOUNT OF WORK ON THIS BILL IS A DEDICATED COUNTLESS HOURS TO LISTENING TO THE VERY DISPARATE VIEWS CRAFTING THE LANGUAGE IN THE BILL AND CREATING A VERY COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS AND WE REALLY APPRECIATE IT. WE'RE NEITHER SUPPORTING NOR OPPOSING THE BILL WE CERTAINLY AGREE IT'S TIME TO JOIN THE DOZENS OF STATES WHICH PERMIT RON I DO WANT TO HIGHLIGHT OUR CONCERNS ABOUT SOME ISSUES WHICH WE STRONGLY BELIEVE SHOULD BE ADDRESSED AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD. SO ON A MACRO LEVEL OUR CONCERNS RELATE TO INTERSTATE RECOGNITION OF OUT OF STATE NOTARIAL ACTS AND THE BREADTH OF THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION CONTAINED IN THE BILL. STATE RECCA. WHISPER THORNY- ON THE LEGAL FRONT RIGHT NOW. DOCUMENTS THAT KNOWLEDGE TO OUT OF STATE INCLUDING THOSE USING REMOTE NOTARIZATION. ARE BEING RECORDED IN CALIFORNIA COUNTIES PURSUANT TO. CIVIL CODE SECTION ELEVEN EIGHTY NINE. IN THE CURRENT LANGUAGE IN THE BILL APPEARS TO TAKE A STEP BACK FROM THIS. LONG STANDING PRINCIPLE OF ACCEPTING NOTARIAL ACTS PERFORMED IN OTHER STATES. THAT IT WILL MAKE CALIFORNIA QUITE A DISTINCT OUT LIAR IN THIS REGARD. WE'RE VERY AFRAID THAT CONSUMERS AND BUSINESSES WILL NOT BE SERVED BY A POTENTIAL SUBSEQUENT LITIGATION CHALLENGING THE VALIDITY OF DOCUMENTS EXECUTED OUT OF STATE. IN SOME CASES THOSE DOCUMENTS MAY NOT BE OPERATIVE UNTIL YEARS AFTER THEY ARE EXECUTED. WE RECOGNIZE CALIFORNIA'S INTEREST IN CONSUMER PROTECTION BUT WE REALLY BELIEVE THAT THIS ISSUE SHOULD BE RESOLVED AS THE BILL PROCEEDS. AND ON THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION THAT OTHERS HAVE MENTIONED. WE THINK THE LANGUAGE SHOULD BE MORE NARROWLY CRAFTED ON ISSUES SUCH AS WHO HAS STANDING TO SUE AND RELATING DAMAGES TO HARM. THERE ARE MORE TECHNICAL- TARGETED ISSUES SUCH AS NOTARY EDUCATION FUNDING AND NO TO RETURN HOLES WHICH WE BELIEVE CAN BE ADDRESSED AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD. AGAIN WE THANK THE COMMITTEE COMMITTEE STAFF ESPECIALLY MISTER MAGNATE AND ESPECIALLY MISTER JONES SAWYER FOR HIS HARD WORK ON THIS WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD AND THANK YOU FOR. LISTENING THANK YOU ALL RIGHT ANYONE LSE WITH OPPOSITION OR CONCERNS BUT WE WILL. NOT BE TAKING TESTIMONY JUST AN INDICATION OF. OPPOSITION CONCERNS OR EVEN SUPPORT. WE DO HAVE ONE MORE LINE CUED UP IF YOU'D LIKE TO TAKE THAT. WE WERE LINE THIRTY FOUR GO AHEAD PLEASE. I CHAIR THE THROUGH THE- NOT REBEL BUT MCAFEE FIFTIETH BIRTHDAY NOTARIZED BY COMBINE OURSELVES WITH THE COMMENTS MADE BY- AND THEN NAY AND MICHAELA THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THIRD OVER THE LINES QUEUED UP AT THIS TIME. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU WE WILL THEN. BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE MISTER JOHN SORRY WANTED THANK YOU FOR TAKING THIS ON THE SUSPEND A SEVERAL YEAR JOURNEY THAT THIS COMMITTEE HAS BEEN WORKING ON. AND I THINK IT IS DEFINITELY TIME THAT CALIFORNIA TAKE ON THE REMOTE ONLINE NOTARIZATION. BUT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO DO CAREFULLY I KNOW A NUMBER OF OTHER STATES HAVE DONE IT BUT CALIFORNIA HAS LONG HAD. A DIFFERENT STANDARD FOR NOTORIOUS SERVICES AND APPROPRIATELY DIFFERENT SANDERS IT IS A LITTLE BIT MORE PROTECTIVE OF CONSUMERS AND THAT HAS SURVIVED SCRUTINY IT'S BEEN AROUND FOR QUITE SOME TIME IT WE ARE JUST INTENDING WITH THIS BILL TO CONTINUE THAT HIGH LEVEL OF PROTECTION FOR CONSUMERS OF SOME OF THE CONCERNS RAISED. I CANNOT REALLY AGREE WITH AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT AS WE GO THROUGH THIS AND THIS IS WHAT YOU CAN READ THIS IN THE ANALYSIS AS WELL. THAT WE ARE NOT TAKING A STEP BACKWARD IN IN FACT REALIGNING OURSELVES WITH WHAT OTHER STATES HAVE DONE AT A LOWER LEVEL OF PROTECTION FOR CONSUMERS THAT'S WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT. THERE ARE. PROBABLY SOME TECHNICAL ISSUES THAT THAT CAN BE RESOLVED OVER TIME. AS THIS WORKS THROUGH ITS PROCESS. AND SOME PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS OF COMMUNICATIONS AND MAKING SURE THAT THAT WE HAVE. THE ABILITY TO RECOGNIZE APPROPRIATE OUT OF STATE. NOTARIZATION AND MANAGE THE DOCUMENTS FROM THAT SO THAT I THINK THERE ARE SOME THINGS TO WORK ON BUT I'M- FOR ME I'M HAPPY WITH THE STATE OF THE BILL RIGHT NOW. I THINK IT IS WORTHY OF. MOVING OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE AND I CERTAINLY HOPE THAT WE DO AND IF WE DON'T THEN IT AT. THAT'S POTENTIALLY ANOTHER SET BACK AND THAT IN GETTING CALIFORNIA TODAY TO SET A BETTER STANDARD FOR REMOTE ONLINE NOTARIZATION AN AWFULLY OTHER STATES WILL. SHIFT AND FOLLOW OUR LEAD I THINK MORE APPROPRIATELY. GIVEN WHAT WE DO SO I THINK YOU YOU HAVE DONE YEOMAN'S WORK ON THIS MISTER JONES SAWYER. AND WITH YOUR PERSONAL STORIES WELL. ILLUSTRATES THE NEED AND NOT JUST DURING A PANDEMIC BUT OVERALL PEOPLE ARE MOVING ONLINE AND HAVE EXPECTATIONS FOR VERY SERVICES ONLINE. SO I THINK THAT'S- APPROPRIATE THE WAY TO GO AND MISTER MEG ATHENS. ANALYSIS REALLY POINTS TO THE ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP BOTH BY SUPPORTERS AND BY OPPOSITIONS AND SOME OF THE AREAS THAT THAT WE MAY NEED TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON BUT I THINK THIS IS A VERY APPROPRIATE THOUGH. AND I'M HAPPY THAT IT IS MOVING ON TO HAVE THOSE DISCUSSIONS AND I'M HOPING WE CAN MOVE THIS BILL TO THE FLOOR AND THEN OFF TO THE SENATE. SO OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS DISCOGRAPHY. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN- THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND I THINK IT'S VERY MUCH NEEDED- IT'S ABOUT TIME THAT WE'VE HAVE REMOTE ONLINE NOTARY- HAVE TO LONG IN THE IN THE MAKING I'M SURE- AS SO I APPRECIATE HIS HIS HARD WORK ON THIS- WHAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT. IS THAT THIS ACTUALLY MAY WITH THE CURRENT LANGUAGE WITHOUT DOING SOME TWEAKS. COULD ACTUALLY DISCOURAGE THE USE OF THIS TECHNOLOGY- AND ALLOW PEOPLE TO USE REMOTE ONLINE NOTARY. AND HERE'S WHAT I'M YEAH MR BELOW I THINK PRETTY APTLY OINTED OUT SOME OF THOSE THINGS ONE IS. WE ARE KIND OF STAND IN THE FACE OF FULL FAITH AND CREDIT CLAUSE THAT ALLOWS. YOU KNOW THINGS THAT WERE DONE IN OTHER STATES TO BE RECOGNIZED- IN CALIFORNIA AND IN FACT WE ALREADY DO THIS- WHEN PEOPLE WHEN PEOPLE. NOTARIZE DOCUMENTS OUT OF STATE. WE ACCEPT THOSE IN CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN A VALID NOTARIZATION OF SAID DEED. FOR INSTANCE- SO I DON'T SEE WHY WE WOULD NOT DO THAT IN THIS CASE WHEN SOMEBODY DOES USES REMOTE ONLINE NOTARY. TECHNOLOGY OUT OF STATE- TO ALSO FULLY ACCEPT THAT IN CALIFORNIA- THE OTHER PROBLEM IS. THE OPENING OF THIS BROUGHT PRIVATE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION- THAT WILL MAYBE DISCOURAGE PEOPLE FROM UTILIZING THIS IF THEY KNOW THE A ONE. ONE MISTAKE ONE- YOU KNOW NOT FOLLOWING ONE IOTA OF THE OF THE LAW SUBJECTS YOU TO BROAD. LITIGATION AND LIABILITY- WE MAY HAVE A LOT ACTORS WHO WON'T DECIDE TO DO REMOTE ONLINE NOTARY SERVICES- IN CALIFORNIA SO I THINK BOTH OF THOSE THINGS COULD BE AN IMPEDIMENT. AND THAT'S OF CONCERN THERE COULD BE IMPEDIMENT TO US UTILIZING WHAT I THINK WE ALL AGREE IS WHAT WE- WILL MORE OF THIS MORE AVAILABILITY OF THIS- IN CALIFORNIA. AND THEN LASTLY. I THINK IT COULD ACTUALLY BE A REALLY BIG IMPEDIMENT TO CONSUMERS AND I'LL I'LL GIVE AN EXAMPLE OF HOW I THINK THIS COULD. HURT CONSUMERS- YOU I HAVE AN OUT OF STATE LANDOWNERS A DEED SELLING IT TO A CONSUMER HERE IN CALIFORNIA WHO WHO WHO BUYS THAT PROPERTY- AND THAT IS DONE OUT OF STATE AND- BY REMOTE ONLINE NOTARY AND YEARS LATER SOMEONE COULD COME BACK AND SAY TO THAT CONSUMER HEY THAT WASN'T DONE. IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF CALIFORNIA LAW THAT'S THAT'S VOID. THAT DATE IS NO GOOD THAT'S A BIG PROBLEM FOR CONSUMERS IF THEY CAN'T HAVE TRUST IN THE FACT THAT WHEN SOMETHING IS SOLD TO THEM AND THEY UTILIZE YOU KNOW REMOTE ONLINE NOTARY THAT THAT'S NOT GOING TO BE A VALID- RECORDING AND GIVE THEM TITLE TO PROPERTY- SO THAT IS A REALLY BIG PROBLEM IF WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THAT AND I THINK IT'S IT REALLY ISN'T A BIG CHANGE THIS IS RECOGNIZING THAT WE'RE GOING TO ALLOW. REMOTE ONLINE NOTARY THIS DONE OTHER STATES TO BERECOGNIZED IN CALIFORNIA AS WELL- AND IT'S NOT LIKE THE STATE'S A REALLY LACKS PROTECTIONS. I REALLY DON'T EVERY SAY THIS DONE THIS HAS PROTECTIONS IN PLACE TO ENSURE THAT. THE PEOPLE HAT ARE DOING THIS ARE WHO THEY SAY THEY ARE. FACT THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT OF HAVING A NOTARY IN THE FIRST PLACE IS THAT YOU APPEAR. YOU CAN BE FOR THE PAIR BEFORE THE NOTARY PHYSICALLY. OR YOU CAN DO IT IN THE DIGITAL WORLD. ONLINE AND THEY ENSURE THAT YOU ARE IN FACT TO YOU SAY YOU ARE IN THIS IS YOUR SIGNATURE. AND AUTHENTIC TO AUTHENTICATE THE DOCUMENT- SO I DON'T THINK THERE REALLY IS ANY CONCERN ABOUT OTHER STATES. YOU KNOW SOMEHOW ALLOWING FOR FRAUDULENT DOCUMENTS TO BE RECORDED THEY HAVE PROTECTIONS AS WELL- IN PLACE SO. I WOULD REALLY HELP ME MAKE THAT CHANGE WE GO FOR A REALLY I WANT TO. BE SUPPORTER OF BRINGING THIS ONLINE BUT I WOULD HOPE THAT. YOU KNOW THE AUTHOR WOULD ENTERTAIN MAKING THOSE THOSE CHANGES TO JUST MAKE SURE THIS IS GONNA BE IS BROADLY AVAILABLE. AS POSSIBLE TO CONSUMERS WHICH IS WHAT I THINK- WE ALL WANT. THREE THANK YOU GERMAN BUT I DID WANT TO SAY. I'M VERY PROUD OF THE WORK THAT WAS DONE ON THIS- I THINK EVERYBODY RECOGNIZES THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE TO ADDRESS. AND THIS IS A LOT OF HARD WORK AND EVEN SPEAKING WITH AND HEARING THE OPPOSITION TODAY IT'S CLEAR THAT WE'RE ON THAT PATH THAT THIS WASN'T SOMETHING THAT WAS DONE BY ONE GROUP AND THAT'S THE END OF IT THIS WAS ABSOLUTE COLLABORATION AND I'M REALLY PROUD OF THE WORK THAT WAS DONE IN THAT REGARD- I THINK THAT. AS A CHAIR HAS MENTIONED THE PROTECTION OF THE CONSUMER IS AT THE TOP OF THE LIST BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING TO LOOK TO US TO MAKE SURE THAT WHATEVER POLICY WE DO PASS PROTECTS THE CONSUMER. AND IT'S MUCH EASIER FOR NO REASON THAN TO FOLLOW WHATEVER THE POLICY IS BUT OUR CONSUMERS RELY ON US TO PROVIDE THAT PROTECTION BUT JUST IN REVIEWING THE VERY EXTENSIVE- ANALYSIS AND IN SPEAKING WITH- THOSE IN SUPPORT IN THOSE WITH CONCERNS IT'S CLEAR THAT A LOT OF WORK HAS GONE INTO THIS AND- THIS IS WHAT THIS IS THE WAY POLICY SHOULD BE DONE. SO THANK YOU SO MUCH. OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS MR. THANK YOU- I HAVE TO START OUT WITH COMPLETELY AGREE I HAD TO DO THREE NOTARIES THIS YEAR- IN REGARDS TO- REAL ESTATE. AND WE'VE SEEN THAT ONLINE WOULD BE A LOT EASIER DUE TO THE FACT THAT- WITH COLD IN THERE TRYING TO HAVE SOMEONE COME TO YOUR HOUSE AND GOING SOMEWHERE. HOWEVER I DO HAVE THE CONCERNED- THAT SOME OF THE OTHERS HAVE SPOKEN ABOUT. AND SO WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO IS. BASICALLY NOT VOTE AT THIS POINT BUT I WANT TO THIS CONCERNS ADDRESSED- BECAUSE I DO THINK IT'S A GREAT HELP I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THOSE. ITEMS ARE TAKEN CARE OF SO THAT WAY I CAN FEEL A BENEFITING EVERYBODY. BUT THANK YOU FOR THIS BILL WILL. THANK YOU NO ONE ELSE. ALL RIGHT RESERVED JONES SAWYER YOU MAY CLOSE AT NIGHT I WANT TO THANK YOU NOT AND I WISH THAT THIS- COMMITTEE OR COMMITTEE MEMBERS COULD HAVE BEEN AT SOME OF OUR MEETINGS- THAT WE'VE HAD ON THIS BILL OF NOT ONLY WAS A COLLABORATIVE BUT- WHAT DO YOU FOR OR AGAINST IT WHEN YOU HAD A SPECIFIC CONCERN. EVERYBODY HAD INPUT AND EVERYBODY EQUAL INPUT AND WE TOOK EVERYONE'S CONCERNS ON THE RIGHT TO PRIVACY ON OUT OF STATE- ARE PROBABLY AT THE TOP OF THE LIST. FOR BOTH SIDES THAT WE NEED TO TRY TO WORK THROUGH THAT- IT IT AND SO I I'D MAKE A COMMITMENT THAT WE WILL- TO THOSE OTHER FORWARD AND IT NAY DEFICIT BECAUSE THIS NEEDS TO MOVE FORWARD ANYTHING TO GET DONE- WHAT THANK MR GALLAGHER FOR ADDING ANOTHER. SHE APPROACH ABOUT TO DEPICTING I NEED TO WORK ON- AND YOU BROUGHT UP ANOTHER POINT THAT I WILL. I WILL TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION AND- I WORK ON MAKING SURE THAT IT DOESN'T INHIBIT CONSUMERS FROM FROM UNIT AND SO FAR. I HEAR EVERYONE LOUD AND CLEARLY. AND AS YOU LISTEN TO EVEN THE OPPOSITION HOPEFULLY YOU HEARD. THAT I AM WILLING TO TRY TO WORK THROUGH AS MANY POSITIONS AS AS POSSIBLE- BUT FROM BUT FOR ME HERE'S MY BET. IS THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE TO IMPLEMENT THAT. THIS DISTINCT THE SECRETARY OF STATE. AND THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. ALSO NEED TO OPEN BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO IMPLEMENT THIS INSIGHT. I VALUE THEIR INPUT ALSO. ON FIFTY ATTORNEY GENERAL BELIEVES THIS IS CONSTITUTIONAL WE SHOULD MOVE FORWARD AND WE NEED TO HAVE THESE PROTECTIONS- HOPEFULLY EVERYONE'S. WE CAN BRING OUR BRING EVERYONE IN A ROOM SO WE CAN TRY TO HASH THAT OUT. ON THE- OF PRIVACY RIGHT ACTION AND THEN ON THE OTHER STATE THAT'S THE SECRETARY STATE WHO HAS TO- REALLY. AUTHORIZED PEOPLE BE ABLE TO DO THAT. AND WE HAVE TO LISTEN TO THEM AND- BASICALLY THERE ARE FOR CALI. AND THEY NOW HAVE THIS OFF JOB NOW AND WE WERE SHOULD.

BEFORE I BEGIN I'D LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF WORKING OVER THE INTERMITTENT A ON THE CURRENT VERSION OF THIS BILL AS WELL AS PENDING CLARIFYING AMENDMENTS THAT ADDRESS NOTE ALL OF THE OPPOSITION CONCERNS. SB FOURTEEN TENCENT SIX PROTECT HOMEOWNER RIGHT BY FIRST ENSURING THOSE IN CHARGE OF A CHOICE HAVE PROPER ETHICS AND HARASSMENT TRAINING. THE CALIFORNIA RESEARCH BURL STUDY HAS SHOWN THAT A TREE BOARD MEMBERS ARE LARGELY UNAWARE OF PRODUZIERT AND ETHICAL RESPONSIBILITIES. VALUENGINE OF THESE LAWS COST HOMEOWNER HR HOMEOWNERS. MONEY WHEN A BOARD MEMBER OR STAFF VIOLATES THE LAW. I UNDERSTAND THAT THE PLYMOUTH ARE CONCERNED THAT REQUIREMENT AT THE KEY TRAINING WOULD DETER HOMEOWNER FROM RUNNING FOR THEIR EIGHT CHOI REPORTS HOWEVER THAT DOES NOT APPEAR SO IN OTHER EXISTING CIRCUMSTANCES SUCH AS COACHING. THAT SAID I'M HAPPY TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH OPPOSITION. NEXT MY BILL ADDRESSES SOMETHING THAT HAS HAPPENED DURING THE PANDEMIC AND NATURAL DISASTERS. HOMEOWNERS IN MY DISTRICT AND BEYOND MY DISTRICT HAVE BEEN CHARGED FOR MINOR VIOLATIONS WHEN THEY HAVE BEEN QUARANTINED AND EVACUATED DURING STATES RUMORED HE'S- THIS BILL IS A COMMONSENSE MEASURE TO UPHOLD HUMAN RIGHTS PROTECT ALL PARTIES FROM HARM.

THANK YOU GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR LOUIS BROWN CALLING TODAY ON BEHALF THE COMMUNITY ASSOCIATIONS INSTITUTE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE ACTION COMMITTEE FIRST LET ME EXPRESS OUR APPRECIATION TO THE AUTHOR OUR PARTNERSHIP IN THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS AND MEETING WITH US ON OUR CONCERNS- WE DO STILL HAVE CONCERNS WITH THE BILL AS PROPOSED TO BE AMENDED ALTHOUGH THE MAINTENANCE DO- OF THE BILL IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION- I JUST LIKE TO RAISE TWO LARGER CONCERNS- AS WE CONTINUE TO LOOK AT SOME OF THE ISSUES DEALING. WITH H. AWAY- I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT EVERY TIME WE AT A COST- THOSE COSTS FORTY WE GET BORN BY THE HOMEOWNERS WITHIN A AND H. AWAY- HOAS ARE PUBLIC BENEFIT CORPORATIONS NONPROFIT. CORPORATIONS THAT OPERATE ON ZERO BASED BUDGET SPEND ANYTIME WE INCREASE THOSE COSTS BROGLIE BORN BY- THE HOMEOWNERS THROUGH INCREASED SEVERANCE WE LOOK AT SOMETHING LIKE MANDATORY TRAINING OR EDUCATION OR BOARD MEMBERS ARE WE ARE CONCERNED BECAUSE ON ANY GIVEN DAY WE DO I FIND IT VERY DIFFICULT TO FIND BOARD MEMBERS TO RUN FOR THE POSITION WE BELIEVE THAT YOU JUST. ADD NEW REQUIREMENTS ACOSTA THAT IT'LL MAKE IT THAT MUCH MORE DFFICULT SO WHAT WILL LIKELY HAPPEN IN THE ACTIVITY WHICH IS THE ASSOCIATION WILL BEAR THOSE COSTS. IN ORDER TO- MAKE IT AGAIN AS APPEALING AS POSSIBLE AFTER SOMEONE TO ASSUME THIS RESPONSIBILITY. AND THEN THAT JUST ADDS TO THE COST OF THIS AN OLD LEE BORN OUT BY THE HOMEOWNERSHIP WE LIKE TO TRY TO WORK WITH YOU THE AUTHOR TO FIND THE MIDDLE GROUND- ON THAT TYPE OF ISSUE- AND THEN AS IT GOES WITH OF RESTRICTING WHAT'S SO IF YOU CAN DO. YOU CAN REACH SPEEDS THEY COPY OF THE DNR'S THEY FIND THAT THEY RECEIVED A COPY AND THAT THEY'VE READ A COPY OF THE SPEECH IN ARE THEY KNOW THE RULES COMING INTO AN ASSOCIATION WHEN THEY BUY INTO AN ASSOCIATION SO WE START TO MAKE CHANGES TO THE T. EIGHTEEN R. FOR WE PROHIBIT SPECIFIC SECTIONS OF TEACHING ART. WE ARE CHANGING THE CONTRACTUAL RELATIONSHIP WITH ALL MEMBERS OF THE ASSOCIATION SO WHILE WE TRY TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE ISSUES OF A FEW- BECAUSE OF COVENANTS OR RESTRICTIONS IN THEIR IN THEIR- SPECIFICALLY TALKING ABOUT THE LANGUAGE WITHIN THE BILL REGARDING ROOMMATES ARE LONG TERM LODGERS. THAT HAS OTHER ISSUES INCREASE OTHER ISSUES FOR MEMBERS OF THE ASSOCIATION SO THERE ARE ALREADY PROCESS IN PLACE TO CHANGE THE CPR'S HOW TO CHANGE THE RULES- THAT AN ASSOCIATION ABIDES BY OR THAT PEOPLE BUY INTO AND SO WE ASK THAT. YOU KNOW WE'D BE VERY CAREFUL AS WE MOVE THROUGH THE PROCESS THAT YOU NEED TO BUILD THAT SEEK TO LIMIT THE OPPORTUNITY FOR AN ASSOCIATION TO HAVE RULES THAT PEOPLE OF BODY INTO AND THAT PEOPLE OF FIVE. TO WITHOUT WE WILL ASK FOR A NO VOTE TODAY BUT DO LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR IF THE BILL MOVES TO CONTINUE TO REFINE THE LANGUAGE THAT'S IN THE AMENDMENTS AND SEE IF WE CAN REACH COMMON.

THEY GO A LONG WAY IN IMPROVING THIS BILL. UNFORTUNATELY WE CONTINUE TO HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT IMPOSING FORMAL TRAINING REQUIREMENTS ON VOLUNTEER HOMEOWNERS HAS HOMEOWNER ASSOCIATIONS ALREADY STRUGGLE TO FIND PEOPLE TO SERVE ON A CHILLY BOARDS. WE ARE ALSO CONCERNED THAT ANY RESULTING INCREASE COSTS OF ASSOCIATIONS WILL RESULT IN INCREASED HOMEOWNER ASSESSMENTS. ADDITIONALLY WE BELIEVE MORE CLARIFICATION IS NEEDED IN THE BILL TO ENSURE THAT THERE ARE NO CANAD CERTAIN CONSEQUENCES TO AN HOAS ABILITY TO REGULATE SHORT TERM RENTALS CONSISTENT WITH EXISTING LAW. TO ENFORCE RESTRICTIONS IN SITUATIONS WHERE HOMEOWNER HAS A LARGER. AND TO ENFORCE VIOLATIONS THAT ARE NOT DUE TO OR IMPACTED BY A STATE OF EMERGENCY.

AWAY AND SERVED AS PRESIDENT AND I THINK THAT IS ONE OF MY CONCERNS LAST YEAR RAND AB FIVE A TO. ME ONLY TO BE ABLE TO. MAKE I EASIER TO RECOLLECT BOARD MEMBERS BECAUSE THERE IS NO BOARD MEMBERS AND I TEND TO JOKES SOMETIMES AS I HAD A RUN FOR SOMETHING TO GET OFF MY BOARD. AND- AND SO THAT'S WHERE I'M HERE ABOUT THEM THAT IS A CONCERN ESPECIALLY WITH- INFLATION IN THE PRICES OF- HOUSING GOING UP IS THAT- IF THERE'S A COST I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW YOU DON'T COST MAIN BIT MINIMUM BUT- IF IT GOES BACK TO THE- H. AWAY. MANAGEMENT TEAM EVENTUALLY IT'S GOING TO GO BACK WHEN THEY HAVE THEIR CONTRACT THE NEXT YEAR AND IS GOING TO COME BACK TO THEM AND I KNOW THAT WE'VE- I WAS GIVEN DIFFERENT TRAINING OPTIONS AND OVER THE YEARS I'VE ALWAYS ASKED HAS ANYONE EVER PICK THEM UP AND THEY HAVEN'T. SO THE I THINK THAT'S MY CONCERN IS- THAT IS GOING TO- EVEN PUSH BACK MORE AND TRYING TO GET GOOD QUALIFIED PEOPLE TO COME AS ALSO TAKING USUALLY IF YOU'RE DOING AN ETHICS CLASS THAT COULD BE A THREE HOUR ETHICS CLASS AND THAT MAY NOT SOUND LIKE A LOT. BUT WHEN PEOPLE ARE BUSY IT COULD BE SOMETHING THAT MIGHT JUST TO TEAR THEM SO. AT THIS TIME GOING TO VOTE NO BUT IF THERE'S THINGS YOU CAN WORK OUT- THAT WOULD BE GREAT. DEFTLY OFFICE. ON THE TOP OF HER. LIKE CONTINUE TO WORK ON FOR. AND ALSO. WE'RE BE THERE THE BEGINNING BUT THIS. THE BEGINNING OF THIS PROCESS SO I'M OPEN TO THAT. BUT JUST ONE THING I WANTED. TO REITERATE TO YOU TALK ABOUT THE INCREASED COST IF WE WERE TO- MAKE THIS ADDITIONAL TRAINING REQUIREMENTS. BUT I LOOK AT IT IS. YEAH MAYBE. IT MAY BE A SMALL INVESTMENT BECAUSE SAY IF YOU DON'T HAVE THIS TRAINING. EDUCATION REGARDING. ETHICS AND HARASSMENT. AT THAT AGE WHITE FACE TO THE LAWSUIT. THEY'RE GOING TO PAY. A LOT OF MONEY OUT. THIS LOOK TO PREVENT THAT RIGHT SO. WHO'S TO SAY THAT OKAY THIS YEAR. WE HAVE TWO OR THREE LAWSUITS BECAUSE- FOLKS WERE HARASSED. OR INTIMIDATED OR WHATEVER WANT TO CALL IT. BUT MAYBE COULD HAVE BEEN PREVENTED IF THAT TRAINING SO WHO'S TO SAY THAT. BECAUSE THE LOSS IS NOT WORKING WE'RE GOING TO WE'RE GOING TO RAISE IT. NEXT YEAR BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT WE HAVE TO COVER THIS ADDITIONAL COST SO. I LOOK AT THIS BILL AS A PREVENTATIVE MEASURE. TO HELP PROTECT THE HOMEOWNERS. ASSOCIATION FROM ANY FUTURE LAWSUITS BECAUSE TECHNICALLY. WHY NOT OUR BOARD MEMBERS WERE EDUCATED AND TRAINED IN THIS SO- THEY HAVE A BETTER CHANCE OF NOT OUR TO. SO JUST CONFIRM FOR. I THINK IT'S- THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION. COMMENTS IT WAS RODRIGUEZ OR THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND I THINK IT IS ABSOLUTELY APPROPRIATE I'VE INTERACTED WITH A NUMBER OF HOAS THROUGHOUT BY MY LIFE IT AND OFTEN TIMES THEY'RE VERY FRUSTRATING BECAUSE IT IS A LOT- OFTEN THE SAME PEOPLE AND I DO UNDERSTAND THE ISSUE ABOUT THE DIFFICULTY IN. IN RECRUITING BUT- OFTENTIMES THE SAME PEOPLE WITH WITHOUT THE SOPHISTICATION OF DEALING WITH. LOTS OF MONEY. AND NOT VERY CLEAR ON THEIR ETHICAL OBLIGATIONS AND THESE ARE PRIVATE ORGANIZATIONS. BUT IN A WAY THEY THEY OPERATE. I THINK AS WE WOULD EXPECT A PUBLIC. BODY TO OPERATE BECAUSE THE PEOPLE LIVING AND PAYING DUES AND THEN AND BEING SUBJECTED TO THAT THE HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION ESPECIALLY IN LARGE COMPLEXES WHERE IT'S DIFFICULT TO MANAGE SO FOR NOT WILLING TO SET AN APPROPRIATE STANDARD THEN THERE IS A LOT OF MISCHIEF THAT CAN HAPPEN AND IT IS IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION AND EVERYONE WHO IS PARTICIPATING IN IT TAT THE- THE THOSE OFFICERS ARE TRAINED THAT THEY UNDERSTAND THICAL OBLIGATIONS AND I DO AGREE WITH YOU THAT IT WILL SAVE A LOT OF GRIEF AND MONEY. DOWN THE LINE TO GO AHEAD WITH THAT STEP SO I THINK IT'S A VERY APPROPRIATE BILL. RIGHT AND WITH THAT YOU MAY CLOSE. WHAT THE RESTRICTIONS RIVAL THANK YOU OKAY SO WE DO HAVE A MOTION IS THEIR SECOND. AND A SECOND THANK YOU YOU MAY CLOSE THIS RODRIGUEZ. PERFECT REACTOR ABOUT THINKING THANK YOU MOTION TO SECOND THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS CALL THE ROLL PLEASE STONE HI STONE AYE GALLAGHER. NOW GALLAGHER NO. SENATE BONTA BONTA I DAVIS DAVIS NO KALRA. KALRA AYE KILEY KILEY NO MAIENSCHEIN REYES FIVE REYES AYE WICKS. THE BILL NEEDS TO MORE SO WE'LL PUT IT ON CALL THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT MS BIRKHEAD ALL OF NUMBER FOUR HR. SEVENTY EIGHT. FINE OKAY. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS- IT'S GOOD TO BE WITH YOU THIS MORNING AS I WAS THINKING ABOUT PRESENTING THIS RESOLUTION BEFORE YOU TODAY I REALIZE THAT MY ENTIRE LIFE I HAVE BENEFITTED FROM THE PRIVACY PROTECTIONS THAT WERE GRANTED IN ROE V. WADE I GIVEN BIRTH THREE TIMES HAD THREE LIVE BIRTHS FIVE THREE BEAUTIFUL CHILDREN. BUT ON MY JOURNEY TO BECOMING A MOTHER AT EVERY MOMENT IT WAS MY DECISION MY DECISION WHAT TO DO MY DECISION WHETHER TO HAVE THAT CHILD. AND THE FACT TODAY WE'RE LOOKING AT REMARKING ON THE FORTY NINTH ANNIVERSARY OF ROE V. WADE WHICH GUARANTEED WOMEN THAT RIGHT TO PRIVACY. AND WE MAY NOT MAKE IT TO THE FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY. WITH ROE V. WADE INTACT. WITH THAT RIGHT TO PRIVACY IT SAYS THAT THE DECISION. THAT A WOMAN MAKES ABOUT HER OWN BODY IS BETWEEN HER HER HEALTH CARE PROVIDER. AND WHOEVER SHE CHOOSES TO MAKE THAT DECISION WITH. I CAN THINK OF NOTHING MORE PRIVATE. THAN THOSE DECISIONS THAT ARE MADE WITH YOUR HEALTHCARE PROVIDER ABOUT WHAT YOU DO WITH YOUR OWN BODY AND THAT IS WHAT ROW GAVE TO WOMEN. GAVE WOMEN HARD FOUGHT EQUITY. THAT WE KNOW MAYBE TURNED BACKWARDS IF THE SUPREME COURT. OVERTURNS OR TAKES AWAY SOME OF THE RIGHTS GUARANTEED IN ROUTE. AND WE KNOW THAT STATES ACROSS THIS COUNTRY ARE WORKING TO TAKE THAT RIGHT AWAY. TWENTY SIX STATES ARE POISED TO BAN ABORTION ACCESS IF ROE V. WADE IS OVERTURNED NO AFFECTS THIRTY SIX MILLION WOMEN. THIS IS BEEN THE WORST YEAR IN HISTORY WHEN IT COMES TO THE PROTECTIONS IN ROE V. WADE MORE THAN A HUNDRED SIX ABORTION RESTRICTIONS HAVE BEEN ENACTED NINETEEN STATES INCLUDING TWELVE ABORTION BANS. SO WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE TODAY BY SAYING THE CALIFORNIA ASKS CONGRESS TO. MAKE A STATEMENT SUPPORTING ABORTION AND COMPREHENSIVE REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE IS CRITICAL TO THE FIGHT THAT WE HAVE BEFORE US. WITH THAT I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE WE HAVE MOLLY ROBSON FROM PLANNED PARENTHOOD ON THE PHONE HAVE ONE WITNESS ON THE PHONE OPERATOR WOULD YOU OPEN THE LINES FOR THE FIRST WITNESS. GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS PARENTHOOD AFFILIATES OF CALIFORNIA WE REPRESENT THE SEVEN AFFILIATES IN THE STATE TO PROVIDE HEALTH CARE- IN OVER A HUNDRED HEALTH CENTERS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. AT FIRST I WANT TO THANK ASSEMBLYMEMBER BARRICADE HAND FOR HER LEADERSHIP OPPORTUNITY RESOLUTION TO CELEBRATE THE FORTY NINTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE HISTORIC ROE V. WADE SUPREME COURT DECISION WHICH PROTECTS THE RIGHT TO ABORTION IN THE UNITED STATES. WE CELEBRATE THE SANTA EVER YEAR BOB THIS YEAR IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT AS THIS YEAR THERE THE CASE CURRENTLY BEFORE THE U. S. SUPREME COURT THAT DIRECTLY CHALLENGES THE LEGAL PROTECTION CRAFTED ROUTE. PENDING A DECISION FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER MENTIONED TWENTY SIX STATES ARE LIKELY TO BAN OR SEVERELY RESTRICT ABORTION. THE BACK HALF OF THE STATES IN THE UNITED STATES WOULD LOSE ACCESS TO ABORTION IMPACTING THIRTY SIX MILLION WOMEN AND MORE PEOPLE WHO ARE CAPABLE OF BECOMING PREGNANT. ROBI LATEST OFF THE FLOOR AND WE'RE FORTUNATE TO BE IN CALIFORNIA WITH LEADERS WHO STAND WITH PLANNED PARENTHOOD AND REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM ORGANIZATION I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT ABORTION IS HEALTH CARE AND ANYTHING LESS THAN EQUITABLE ACCESS WILL DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECT COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. SHE DOES NOT FOR ACCESS TO CARE AND THOSE IN RURAL AREAS OF OUR STATE. WE WILL NOT STOP FIGHTING TO PROTECT THE RIGHT TO ABORTION AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK TO EXPAND ACCESS NOT A FOR CALIFORNIANS BUT ALSO FOR THOSE WHO ARE GOING TO BE FOR FIFTY CARE HERE.

I'M A MOTHER OF SEVEN. AND AN ATTORNEY. I AM ALSO THE DIRECTOR OF OUTREACH AT THE RIGHT TO LIFE LEAGUE AMERICA'S FIRST PRO LIFE ORGANIZATION FOUNDED IN NINETEEN SIXTY SEVEN RIGHT HERE IN CALIFORNIA. I PRESUME YOU KNOW THAT THIS LEGISLATIVE BODY MADE ABORTION LEGAL IN CALIFORNIA FIFTY FIVE YEARS AGO SIX YEARS BEFORE ROE VERSUS WADE. THE SUPREME COURT DECISION IN JOBS WILL LIKELY SEND THE ISSUE BACK TO THE STATES HAVING NO IMPACT WHATSOEVER ON ABORTION IN CALIFORNIA. H. R. SEVENTY EIGHT IS YOUR RESPONSIBLE VIRTUE SIGNALING. THANKS TO BIDEN'S BLUE STATE BAILOUT CALIFORNIA NOW HAS A WHOPPING THIRTY ONE BILLION DOLLAR STATE SURPLUS AND ARE SENATE PRESIDENT PRO TEM TONI ATKINS ALREADY WANTS TO USE THIS SURPLUS TO PAY THE ABORTION INDUSTRY TO MAKE CALIFORNIA THE SANCTUARY ABORTION HUB OF THE NATION. PAYING TO FLY WOMEN TO CALIFORNIA TO GET FREE ABORTIONS HERE SUBSIDIZING THEIR LODGING HERE AND YES EVEN THEIR CHILD CARE HERE WHILE THEY'RE GETTING FREE ABORTIONS. THIS IS INSANITY THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA DO NOT WANT TO BANK ROLL EVERY ABORTION IN THE COUNTRY CALIFORNIANS ARE FLEEING THE STATE WE HAVE THE HIGHEST TAX RATE IN THE COUNTRY HOUSING IS TOTALLY UNAFFORDABLE FOR MANY BUSINESSES ARE SHUTTING DOWN OR LEAVING ORGANIZE SMASH AND GRAB GANGS ARE TERRORIZING SHOPPERS WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH POLICE TO KEEP PEOPLE SAFE HOMELESS ENCAMPMENTS ARE IN EVERY CITY UNDER FREEWAYS AND CALIFORNIA'S PUBLIC SCHOOLS ARE FAILING OUR CHILDREN THURMOND WOULD YOU STICK TO THE STUFF OUT CALIFORNIA. IS A DUMPSTER FIRE AND YOU HAVE CHOSEN TO SPEND FINITE TIME AND LIMITED LEGISLATIVE RESOURCES ON HR SEVENTY EIGHT A REAL RESOLUTION THAT DOES NOT AFFECT A SINGLE CALIFORNIA WOMAN IN ORDER TO PONTIFICATE ABOUT ABORTION THIS RESOLUTION ILLUSTRATES THIS BODIES INCREASINGLY DANGEROUS RELEVANCY AND ITS INABILITY TO RESPONSIBLY GOVERN CALIFORNIA WE OPPOSE HR SEVENTY EIGHT THANK YOU THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE IN THE HEARING ROOM. HELLO MY NAME IS ONE THAT SILLS AND I SERVICE A DIRECTOR OF CALIFORNIANS FOR LIFE I SPEAK IN OPPOSITION TO THIS RESOLUTION WHICH WAS SPONSORED BY OUR COUNTRY'S LARGEST ABORTION BUSINESS PLANNED PARENTHOOD. ABORTIONS ARE DONE AT PLANNED PARENTHOOD UP TO SIX MONTHS OF PREGNANCY WELL BEYOND BY ABILITY THIS IS A GRUESOME BARBARIC TO DAY PROCEDURE WHICH REQUIRES THE DECAPITATION. AND DISMEMBERMENT OF THE CHILD IN THE WOMB. IN H. R. IF H. R. SEVENTY EIGHT WAS CELEBRATING THE DISMEMBERMENT AND DECAPITATION OF SO CALLED. UNWANTED OR INCONVENIENT PUPPIES. WOULD YOU STILL SUPPORT THIS RESOLUTION SURELY WOMEN AND CHILDREN DESERVE BETTER THAN ABORTION. I HAVE READ THOUSANDS OF WOMEN WHO HAVE ARRIVED AT PLANNED PARENTHOOD THINKING THAT THEIR LIFE CIRCUMSTANCES WERE SO DIFFICULT THAT THEY WERE CONSIDERING ENDING THE LIFE OF THEIR CHILD. YET MANY WOMEN WILL CHANGE THEIR MIND WHEN GIVEN LEVINE HELP ASSISTANCE RESOURCES ENCOURAGEMENT. JUST THINK WHAT THIS YEAR'S BUDGET SURPLUS COULD DO TO ACTUALLY HELP WOMEN SOLVE THESE OFTENTIMES FIXABLE PROBLEMS RATHER THAN JUST PROMOTING MORE AND MORE APPROVED ABORTION. WE DON'T IN POVERTY BY KILLING MORE POOR CHILDREN. WOMEN COME OUT OF PLANNED PARENTHOOD WALKING WOUNDED SOME HURTING SO BADLY THERE ARE BARELY ABLE TO GET TO THE CAR LEAVING MANY WOMEN TO SUFFER FROM DEPRESSION ANXIETY PANIC ATTACKS NIGHTMARES DRUG ALCOHOL ADDICTIONS. AND THOUGHTS OF SUICIDE FOR YEARS TO COME ESPECIALLY WOMEN WHO ARE LIED TO AND TOLD. IT'S JUST A COUPLE OF CELLS. WE HEAR FOLLOW THE SCIENCE WELL SCIENCE PROVES THE HUMANITY OF THE CHILD IN THE WOMB EVERYONE HAS HEARD THE SOUND OF THE BABY'S HEART BEAT WE HAVE ALL SEEN THE ULTRASOUND IMAGES OF A BABY MOVING HIS OR HER ARMS AND LEGS HER FACE. ALL OF WHICH ARE UNDENIABLY HUMAN. MAY THE MEMBERS OF OUR LEGISLATURE BE ON THE POSITIVE LEVINE LIFESAVING PRO LIFE PRO WOMAN PRO SCIENCE SIDE OF HISTORY FOR ALL THESE REASONS WE URGE YOU TO VOTE NO ON HR SEVENTY EIGHT.

THAT HAS BEEN ADOPTED BY THIS COMMITTEE THANK YOUNG- MEMBERS APPRECIATE MR THANK YOU SO WE WILL NOW MOVE TO ITEM NUMBER ONE AB SIX SEVENTY SIX MR HOLDEN'S BILL THAT IS BEING PRESENTED BY MS BONTA. MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT AB SIX SEVEN SIX TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE AUTHOR ASSEMBLY MEMBER HOLDEN. THIS BILL WOULD TAKE WILL TAKE A NUMBER OF STEPS TO RECTIFY THE UNBALANCED RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FRANCHISEE AND FRANCHISOR OURS. IN TWENTY FIFTEEN ASSEMBLY MEMBER HOLDEN AUTHORED AB FIVE TWO FIVE WHICH MADE CALIFORNIA THE STANDARD BEARER ON FAIRNESS FOR THE FRANCHISOR AND FRANCHISEE RELATIONSHIP. MEMBER HOLDEN DECIDED TO TAKE ON THIS ISSUE BASED ON HIS OWN EXPERIENCE AS A FRANCHISEE. AND THE STORIES HE HEARD FROM CURRENT FRANCHISEES. PEOPLE DOING THEIR BEST TO RUN SMALL BUSINESSES DESPITE THE UNFAIR CONTRACTS THAT FIGHT THEY FIND THEMSELVES IN. AND DESPITE THE PROTECTIONS UNDER AB FIVE TWO FIVE THE PANDEMIC REVEALED. NEW PREDATORY BEHAVIOR WHICH MUST BE ADDRESSED. BETWEEN ADVOCATING RESPONSIBILITIES TO FRANCHISEES DURING THE COPA NINETEEN PANDEMIC. AND THE ELEVATION OF UNFIT AND THE REVELATION OF UNFAIR TESTAMENT OF FRANCHISEES OF COLOR. IT IS CLEAR FRANCHISEES NEED EIGHTY SIX SEVEN SIX. THIS BILL DOES MULTIPLE THINGS TO RESOLVE THESE ISSUES. IT EXPLICITLY PROHIBITS FRANCHISE ORES FROM INFLUENCING WHERE A FRANCHISEE CAN PURCHASE A FRANCHISE BASED OUT OF PROTECTED CLASSES SUCH AS RACE. RECENT LAWSUITS AGAINST MCDONALD'S BY AFRICAN AMERICAN FRANCHISEES. DETAILED THE ONGOING ISSUES. SOME FRANCHISORS HAVE LEVERAGE THE PANDEMIC TO SHIFT LIABILITY ON TO FRANCHISEES IN EXCHANGE FOR FINANCIAL HELP. THE BILL PROHIBITS THIS PRACTICE. CURRENTLY FRANCHISE ORES ARE UNILATERALLY DETERMINING THE- AMOUNT FRANCHISEES- WHEN AN AGREEMENT IS BEING TO TURN TERMINATED ON. OR NOT RENEWED. THIS BILL INCREASES FAIRNESS BY GIVING BOTH PARTIES SA. AB SIX SEVEN SIX WILL ALSO PROMOTE ADEQUATE THE QUICK DISCLOSURES AND ON. AND ENSURE THAT ALL FRANCHISORS AND FRANCHISEES IN CALIFORNIA. ARE COVERED BY THE LAW. ASSEMBLY MEMBER HOLDEN HAS SPENT YEARS DISCUSSING THIS ISSUE AND WILL CONTINUE TO ENGAGE ALL STAKEHOLDERS IN THE AMOUNTS TO COME. IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE WAS A LAST AT LETTER OF CONCERN WHICH IS ONLY MEMBER STAFF. IS REVIEWING TO EDGE THOSE FROM AND TIMELY. THANK YOU AND ON BEHALF OF THE AUTHOR I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS. I HAVE KEITH MILLER HERE PRESENTING REPRESENTINGFRANCHISEES HERE AS AWAY.

OUR FIRST WITNESS PLEASE. GOOD MORNING. YEAH AFTER THE MOVE UP- I GUESS MY KNEES AND BEG OR SO NO WORRIES IS NEEDED BUT THANK YOU SIR STONE VICE CHAIR ALLAGHER A MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME TODAY- HOPE ASSEMBLY MEMBER HOLDEN IS- WATCHING IN AND I THANK HIM FOR TAKING THE LEAD ON THE FRANCHISE ISSUES AND THANK YOU OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER BONTA FOR STEPPING IN TODAY MY NAME IS KEITH MILLER I'M HERE TODAY TO SUPPORT AB SIX SEVEN SIX ON BEHALF. OF ITS TO SPONSORS IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AT FOR MY ONSULTING COMPANY FRANCHISEE ADVOCACY CONSULTING TO BETTER ASSIST FRANCHISEES AND CONCENTRATE ON LEGISLATION TO PROTECT THE TRUE INVESTORS IN THE INDUSTRY I ALSO SERVED AS THE DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS AND ENGAGEMENT FOR THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF FRANCHISEES AND DEALERS BUT PROBABLY MOST IMPORTANTLY I'VE BEEN A SUBWAY FRANCHISEE IN CALIFORNIA SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT CURRENTLY WITH THREE LOCATIONS IN GRASS VALLEY AND OPPER. SO YES I HAVE SKIN IN THE GAME SO TO SPEAK. THE OF THIS BILL A SAMPLE IT'S TO BUILD ON AND BETTER CLARIFY WHAT WE'VE DONE IN THE PAST. PROVIDE BETTER- GREATER TRANSPARENCY AND ULTIMATELY BETTER PROTECT THE FRANCHISE INVESTORS IN THE STATE CALIFORNIA FRANCHISE LAW CAN'T BE WAIVED ON FRANCHISE LOCATIONS THAT ARE LOCATED IN THE STATE. NO MATTER WHERE THE INVESTORS ARE. WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT PROSPECTIVE FRANCHISEES BUYING INTO AN EXISTING FRANCHISE UNDERSTAND THE APPROVAL REQUIREMENTS AND THE FRANCHISE OR FOLLOWS THOSE STANDARDS. WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT FRANCHISEES ARE TREATED EQUALLY WITH RESPECT. TO APPROVAL OR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE NO MATTER WHAT THEIR CHARACTERISTICS ARE OR COMPOSITION OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD YES. WE NEED TO ENSURE THE FRANCHISE OR IS HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR VIOLATIONS OF THE STATE FRANCHISE LAWS IF ANY OFFICER AGENT OR EMPLOYEE VIOLATES A STATUTE. AND WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT DISCLAIMERS ARE NOT USED TO HIDE VIOLATIONS OF THE FRANCHISE LAW THESE ARE THE PRIMARY GOALS OF AB SIX SEVEN SIX. AS ALWAYS WE WILL WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION TO ANSWER AND CLARIFY QUESTIONS- TALK TO THEIR LOBBYIST ON FRIDAY AND I BELIEVE WE HAVE SOME LANGUAGE THAT WILL DO AFTER THIS COMMITTEE- TO HELP CLARIFY- AND WE CAN SOLVE THAT. BUT THE REALITY AS FRANCHISE OUTLETS IN CALIFORNIA SHOULD FALL UNDER THE LAW AND OFTEN THE OPPOSITION WILL THROW OUT THAT. IT'LL INCREASE LITIGATION FACT THE MAP AREAS FRANCHISEES RARELY HAVE THE RESOURCES TO DO LEGAL BATTLE AGAINST LARGE CORPORATION OF THE FRANCHISE BRAND. A FRIEND OF MINE SAID IT BEST MOST FRANCHISEES CAN'T AFFORD THE FREE CONSULTATION. IN CLOSING I LOOK FORWARD TO ANY CONTINUING DISCUSSION AND ASK REAR AYE VOTE TODAY THANK YOU.
