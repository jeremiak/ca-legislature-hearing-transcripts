STRENGTH ENCOURAGEMENT AND LOVE. AND I'M SO GRATEFUL THAT THEY CAN MAKE IT HERE TODAY. MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE BEFORE YOU TODAY. THIS IS A PIVOTAL TIME FOR TRANSPORTATION IN CALIFORNIA. OUR TRANSPORTATION LANDSCAPE IS UNDERGOING MASSIVE TRANSFORMATION DUE TO TECHNOLOGY AND NEW MOBILITY OPTIONS. ON TOP OF THAT CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING FACTORS. CALIFORNIA'S POPULATION IS AGING AND INCREASING CONGESTION AND LONG COMMUTES CONTINUE TO BE A REALITY STATEWIDE. THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR IS A MAJOR CONTRIBUTOR TO GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. FATALITIES AND SERIOUS INJURIES ON OUR ROADWAYS ARE INCREASING. AND FINALLY WITH CALIFORNIA BEING THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD COMES THE RESPONSIBILITY OF MOVING FREIGHT SAFELY AND EFFICIENTLY ALL MAINTAINING WHILE MINIMIZING ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS ESPECIALLY ON DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. SO ALL OF THIS ADDS UP TO BIG CHALLENGES AS WELL AS OPPORTUNITIES. I WILL TACKLE THESE ISSUES WITH A SENSE OF URGENCY. AND ARE WILL APPLY THE MANY EXPERIENCES AND LESSONS LEARNED OVER MY THREE DECADES IN FEDERAL STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT. AS WELL AS THE PRIVATE SECTOR TO BRING ABOUT BETTER MOBILITY OUTCOMES FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. INNOVATION IS A KEY COMPONENT OF OUR STRATEGY TO EXPAND THE ABILITY FOR ALL WHILE REDUCING TRANSPORTATION RELATED FATALITIES. AND WITH THE ERROR OF AUTONOMOUS AND CONNECTED VEHICLES UNFOLDING WE ARE CREATING A STATEWIDE POLICY FRAMEWORK. TO PLAN FOR THESE TECHNOLOGIES. IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO MENTION THAT HIGH SPEED RAIL IN SP ONE ARE BOOSTING THE ECONOMY BY EMPLOYING THOUSANDS ACROSS THE STATE AND HELPING SMALL BUSINESSES WORK ON IMPORTANT INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS. SB ONE IS ALLOWING US TO BRING OUR AGING TRANSPORTATION NETWORK TO STATE OF GOOD REPAIR. ALONG WITH IMPROVING TRANSIT SYSTEMS AND TRADE AND COMMUTE CORRIDORS. WE ARE KEEPING OUR PROMISE TO DO THIS AS EFFICIENTLY AS POSSIBLE. MODERNIZING THE DMV IS ALSO AN IMPORTANT PRIORITY FOR ME. I'M WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE DMV IS NEW LEADERSHIP TEAM TO IMPROVE THE DELIVERY OF SERVICES TO CALIFORNIANS ALL BECOMING A MORE EFFICIENT ORGANIZATION. MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THE TRANSPORTATION CHALLENGES BEFORE US ARE SIGNIFICANT. WE ARE AT A CRITICAL MOMENT WERE OUR COLLECTIVE ACTIONS AND DECISIONS WILL SHAPE THE ABILITY OF ALL CALIFORNIANS TO ACHIEVE A BETTER QUALITY OF LIFE. TO FULLY MEET THEIR MOBILITY NEEDS AND TO ENABLE OUR CITIZENS TO THRIVE IN A HEALTHY. SAFE AND PRODUCTIVE MANNER. I PLEDGE TO BRING A RELENTLESS FOCUS ON IMPROVING OUR TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM FOR THE BENEFIT OF ALL CALIFORNIANS.

TEAM EFFORTS. THAT COMMITMENT THAT YOU'VE MADE TO SERVE OUR STATE. I ALSO ENJOYED OUR CONVERSATION AND SOME. COMMON CONNECTIONS ALONG THE WAY IS YOU KNOW MY DISTRICT INCLUDES HIGHWAY ONE WHICH IS KIND OF AN ON GOING PROJECT FOR PROTECTING SAFETY IN. THAT VITAL THOROUGHFARE FOR NOT JUST TOURISM BUT ALSO WORK FORCE. WE TALKED SOME ABOUT AS WE GET MORE ENERGY EFFICIENT WITH THEIR VEHICLES MORE PEOPLE MOVING TO ZERO MISSIONAL LECTURED VEHICLES. HOW DO WE SUSTAIN SUPPORT FOR INFRASTRUCTURE I KNOW SB ONE. WAS OVERDUE IN IS BEING DIRECTED TO A TARGET PRIMARILY FIRST AND FOREMOST SAFETY REPAIRS TO PROTECT PUBLIC SAFETY BUT AS WE MOVE FORWARD HAD WE MEET THE CHALLENGE OF MAINTAINING THIS INFRASTRUCTURE WITH MORE FUEL EFFICIENT VEHICLES. AND HAD WE MAXIMIZE FEDERAL SUPPORT FOR OUR OUR NEEDS HERE IN CALIFORNIA. SENATOR YOU BIãU POINTED IT QUICKLY POINT OUT THE CONUNDRUM WITH RESPECT TO THE CURRENT GAS TAX BOTH THE STATE AND FEDERAL LEVEL WITH THE RISE OF ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES AND GREATER FUEL EFFICIENCY. THE CHALLENGE IS HOW DO YOU MAINTAIN THAT REVENUE BASE AND I THINK WHAT EVERYBODY CAN AGREE ON AMONG TRANSPORTATION STAKEHOLDERS AS WELL AS MEMBERS OF CONGRESS IN WASHINGTON. IS THAT IN THE LONG RUN THE GAS TAX IS NOT SUSTAINABLE AS A LONG TERM REVENUE SOURCE AND WE HAVE TO START LOOKING AT ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF REVENUE AND AS YOU POINTED OUT THE ROACH CHARGE SYSTEM. WHICH WAS PILOTED HERE IN CALIFORNIA A COUPLE YEARS AGO IS A POTENTIAL STRATEGY MOVING FORWARD. WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO IN THIS ROLE IS CONTINUE TO EXPLORE THAT FURTHER AS YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA. LAUNCH THE LARGEST PILOT PROGRAM A COUPLE YEARS AGO LARGEST IN THE NATION MUCH WAS LEARNED WE STILL HAVE MUCH MORE TO LEARN MORE RESEARCH NEEDS TO BE DONE AND SO I WANT TO WORK CLOSELY WITH CALTRANS IN THE CTC. ANOTHER INSTANT PARTIES TO SEE WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO LEARN MORE ABOUT A POTENTIAL ROAD CHARGE SYSTEM A BECAUSE THAT'S A THAT THAT IS A HUGE CHANGE IN DYNAMIC IF WE ARE EVER TO GO TO THAT. SYSTEM OF COLLECTING REVENUE FOR TRANSPORTATION PURPOSES BUT IT'S SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE. BECAUSE AGAIN YOUR POINT IS WELL WELL TAKEN THE GAS TAX IS NOT SUSTAINABLE THE LONG TERM WE HAVE TO START LOOKING AT OTHER ALTERNATIVES. CREATE WILL THANK YOU AND AGAIN CONGRATULATIONS IN I THINK I SPEAK FOR ALL OF US IN THE LEGISLATURE WE WANT TO SUPPORT YOU IN BEING SUCCESSFUL. YOUR SUCCESS WILL BE THAT OF ALL CALIFORNIANS.
