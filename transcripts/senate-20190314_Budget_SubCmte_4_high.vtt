00:14:26.098 --> 00:14:27.967
STEP IN A GREATER EXPANSION OF

00:14:28.033 --> 00:14:30.135
THE CALIFORNIA VOLUNTEERS.

00:14:30.202 --> 00:14:31.937
PROGRAM IN PARTICULAR --

00:14:32.004 --> 00:14:33.405
AS WAS MENTIONED --

00:14:33.472 --> 00:14:36.108
THAT THERE'S A NG FUND

00:14:36.175 --> 00:14:37.676
REQUIREMENT FOR THESE FUNDS AS

00:14:37.743 --> 00:14:39.878
COMPARED TO THE EXISTING PROGRAM

00:14:39.945 --> 00:14:41.213
THE MATCHING FUNDS THAT ARE

00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:42.047
REQUIRED TO BE PUT FORWARD BY

00:14:42.114 --> 00:14:42.681
THESE.

00:14:42.748 --> 00:14:44.083
NEW GRANTEES WOULD BE LOWER THAN

00:14:44.149 --> 00:14:45.317
HAS TRADITIONALLY BEEN TRUE WITH

00:14:45.384 --> 00:14:46.986
THIS PROGRAM IN WALL THERE MAY

00:14:47.052 --> 00:14:48.020
BE ARGUMENTS --

00:14:48.087 --> 00:14:49.688
THAT THAT COULD BE NECESSARY IN

00:14:49.755 --> 00:14:52.091
ORDER TO ENCOURAGE A GRANTEES TO

00:14:52.157 --> 00:14:54.260
FORM PROGRAMS AND AREAS WHERE

00:14:54.326 --> 00:14:55.594
THEY DIDN'T EXIST BEFORE.

00:14:55.661 --> 00:14:56.895
IN LIGHT OF THE FACT THAT THIS --

00:14:56.962 --> 00:14:58.330
IS BEING VIEWED AS A FIRST STEP

00:14:58.397 --> 00:15:00.232
TOWARDS GREATER EXPANSION OF

00:15:00.299 --> 00:15:03.002
THIS MIGHT BE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR

00:15:03.068 --> 00:15:04.803
THE STATE TO TEST OUT.

00:15:04.870 --> 00:15:06.605
WHAT KIND OF MODELS COULD WORK

00:15:06.672 --> 00:15:08.207
FOR GREATER EXPANSION IN IN

00:15:08.274 --> 00:15:09.908
PARTICULAR TESTING OUT WHETHER

00:15:09.975 --> 00:15:12.044
IF WE STICK WITH THE EXISTING

00:15:12.111 --> 00:15:16.749
MATCHING?

00:15:16.815 --> 00:15:17.983
WOULD THERE BE WITH THEIR STILL

00:15:18.050 --> 00:15:19.752
BE ENOUGH DEMAND AMONG GRANTEES

00:15:19.818 --> 00:15:21.654
TO FORM NEW PROGRAMS IN A FOR

00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:22.821
THAT WERE THE CASE.

00:15:22.888 --> 00:15:24.323
THEN THE STATE'S DOLLARS TOWARDS

00:15:24.390 --> 00:15:25.891
A GREATER EXPANSION WOULD GO

00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:27.159
FURTHER --

00:15:27.226 --> 00:15:29.695
IN COULD CREATE MORE SLOTS IN

00:15:29.762 --> 00:15:31.330
THE FUTURE.

00:15:31.397 --> 00:15:32.231
IF -- THE

00:15:32.298 --> 00:15:33.265
MATCHING FUNDS WERE A LITTLE BIT

00:15:33.332 --> 00:15:35.334
HIGHER ON THE LOCAL LEVEL SO

00:15:35.401 --> 00:15:35.868
IT'S SOMETHING TO CONSIDER

00:15:35.934 --> 00:15:37.903
MOVING FORWARD.

00:15:37.970 --> 00:15:39.738
COULD YOU RESPOND TO THAT SURE.

00:15:39.805 --> 00:15:41.707
SO I'VE BEEN IN THIS POSITION

00:15:41.774 --> 00:15:42.408
FOR TWELVE YEARS.

00:15:42.474 --> 00:15:44.576
WE HAVE CONSISTENTLY HAD

00:15:44.643 --> 00:15:46.745
PRIORITY POINTS GIVEN TO THOSE

00:15:46.812 --> 00:15:48.647
COUNTIES THOSE YOU OFTEN TEND

00:15:48.714 --> 00:15:49.481
COUNTIES.

00:15:49.548 --> 00:15:52.318
THAT ARE UNABLE TO PUT FORWARD A

00:15:52.384 --> 00:15:54.853
GRANT THAT EVER GETS FUNDED.

00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:55.721
AND THE REASON THEY DON'T GET

00:15:55.788 --> 00:15:57.356
FUNDED IT BECAUSE IS BECAUSE

00:15:57.423 --> 00:15:58.857
SIMPLY THERE ARE NOT MATCH

00:15:58.924 --> 00:15:59.892
DOLLARS AVAILABLE IN THEIR

00:15:59.958 --> 00:16:01.694
COMMUNITY.

00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:02.528
SO I'VE GOT.

00:16:02.594 --> 00:16:05.130
LIKE LIVING EXPERIENCE OF THIS.

00:16:05.197 --> 00:16:08.567
AND SO SO I WOULD ARGUE TO

00:16:08.634 --> 00:16:09.735
REALLY TACKLE THIS IS TO

00:16:09.802 --> 00:16:11.270
RECOGNIZE.

00:16:11.337 --> 00:16:13.639
AS WE HAVE THAT IN CERTAIN

00:16:13.706 --> 00:16:14.973
COMMUNITIES YOU NEED TO KICK

00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:17.009
START THIS YOU NEED TO BOTH

00:16:17.076 --> 00:16:18.410
DEVELOP THAT OPERATIONAL

00:16:18.477 --> 00:16:21.113
CAPABILITY OF NONPROFITS AND SAY

00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:23.382
WE'RE GOING TO AUGMENT THIS A

00:16:23.449 --> 00:16:24.216
BIT.

00:16:24.283 --> 00:16:25.851
OKAY TO ENSURE THAT YOU CAN GET

00:16:25.918 --> 00:16:27.586
THIS STARTED AND REALLY ADDRESS

00:16:27.653 --> 00:16:29.254
CRITICAL NEEDS IN YOUR COMMUNITY

00:16:29.321 --> 00:16:30.756
OUR RURAL COMMUNITIES ARE

00:16:30.823 --> 00:16:32.424
CENTRAL VALLEY NEEDS THESE KINDS

00:16:32.491 --> 00:16:33.659
OF RESOURCES.

00:16:33.726 --> 00:16:35.361
YOU'VE GOT HIGHER POVERTY RATES

00:16:35.427 --> 00:16:36.729
YOU'VE GOT JUST REALLY

00:16:36.795 --> 00:16:40.532
ENTRENCHED ISSUES AND NOT ENOUGHSTRONG NON PROFITS THEY CAN

00:16:40.599 --> 00:16:42.000
WRITE COMPETITIVE AMERICORPS

00:16:42.067 --> 00:16:44.036
GRANTS TO SECURE THE FUNDS THEY

00:16:44.103 --> 00:16:44.670
NEED.

00:16:44.737 --> 00:16:46.572
THAT'S THE PROBLEM WE'RE TRYING

00:16:46.638 --> 00:16:47.940
TO KIND OF SOLVE FOR ANNA ALSO

00:16:48.006 --> 00:16:51.043
COMMENT THAT WE HAVE RUN THIS BY

00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:52.778
ISSUE A BOX WE CAN ATTEST.

00:16:52.845 --> 00:16:55.447
BY THE GROUP OF CURRENT GRANT

00:16:55.514 --> 00:16:58.317
TEASE TO HELP THEM UNDERSTAND.

00:16:58.384 --> 00:17:00.819
OUR STRATEGY FOR THIS AND THEY

00:17:00.886 --> 00:17:02.621
ARE SUPPORTIVE OF THIS EVEN

00:17:02.688 --> 00:17:04.656
THOUGH THEY RECOGNIZE THAT THERE

00:17:04.723 --> 00:17:07.326
IS ADDITIONAL FUNDS BEING GIVEN.

00:17:07.393 --> 00:17:09.728
TO THIS DESERT OF SERVICE IN THE

00:17:09.795 --> 00:17:11.029
MIDDLE OF OUR STATE THAT

00:17:11.096 --> 00:17:12.564
DESPERATELY NEEDS THESE KINDS OF

00:17:12.631 --> 00:17:13.699
RESOURCES.

00:17:13.766 --> 00:17:15.033
AND WE NEED PEOPLE WITH IN THE

00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:19.805
CENTRAL VALLEY TO SERVE THEIR

00:17:19.872 --> 00:17:21.540
FELLOW COMMUNITY MEMBERS

00:17:21.607 --> 00:17:21.840
[inaudible]

00:17:21.907 --> 00:17:24.042
YES.

00:17:24.109 --> 00:17:25.411
DIRECTOR IDEA CERTAINLY HAVE A

00:17:25.477 --> 00:17:27.546
SYMPATHY BECAUSE I AM ORIGINALLY

00:17:27.613 --> 00:17:29.415
FROM IN FRONT FORMED THE CENTRAL

00:17:29.481 --> 00:17:32.351
VALLEY RIGHT BUT I MUST ADMIT.

00:17:32.418 --> 00:17:33.952
THERE ARE OTHER VALLEY'S.

00:17:34.019 --> 00:17:35.721
THAT SHOULD HAVE EQUAL STANDING

00:17:35.788 --> 00:17:37.656
THAT HAVE EQUAL PROBLEMS

00:17:37.723 --> 00:17:40.559
COACHELLA SACRAMENTO HAS KICKED

00:17:40.626 --> 00:17:42.428
TO THE NORTH SACRAMENTO ABOUT.

00:17:42.494 --> 00:17:43.362
AND DID.

00:17:43.429 --> 00:17:44.329
SOME CONCERN TO ME THAT YOUR

00:17:44.396 --> 00:17:46.098
FOCUS SO MUCH JUST ON THE QUOTE

00:17:46.165 --> 00:17:47.566
CENTRAL VALLEY.

00:17:47.633 --> 00:17:49.134
WHAT ABOUT OTHER AREAS I KNOW I

00:17:49.201 --> 00:17:50.736
APPRECIATE THE PEOPLE BEING UP

00:17:50.803 --> 00:17:52.638
IN PARADISE YEAH HUNDRED OF THEM

00:17:52.704 --> 00:17:55.507
DEVASTATED AREA HONOR THAT'S

00:17:55.574 --> 00:17:59.812
PARADISE ON SENATOR OF COURSE

00:17:59.878 --> 00:18:02.714
GOT FOLKS UP THERE BUT?

00:18:02.781 --> 00:18:03.749
I HATE TO SEE OTHERS EXCLUDED.

00:18:03.816 --> 00:18:04.516
AND THAT IS COMMON IN EQUITY

00:18:04.583 --> 00:18:06.118
BECAUSE SOME OF THE COUNTIES

00:18:06.185 --> 00:18:06.819
ALREADY.

00:18:06.885 --> 00:18:08.353
AS TO THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE THE

00:18:08.420 --> 00:18:10.122
THE HIGHER COST YEAR THAN THOSE

00:18:10.189 --> 00:18:13.025
WHO ARE COMING IN I THEY DON'T

00:18:13.091 --> 00:18:15.394
MIND THAT.

00:18:15.461 --> 00:18:17.229
WHAT DO YOU KNOW THAT FOR

00:18:17.296 --> 00:18:19.231
EXAMPLE IN BUTTE COUNTY --

00:18:19.298 --> 00:18:22.701
IT HAS POINT 6% OF THE STATE'S

00:18:22.768 --> 00:18:25.404
POPULATION BUT POINT 2% OF OUR

00:18:25.471 --> 00:18:26.738
AMERICORPS.

00:18:26.805 --> 00:18:29.141
RESOURCE SAID THEY ARE ACTUALLY.

00:18:29.208 --> 00:18:30.542
THEY HAVE A HIGHER THAN

00:18:30.609 --> 00:18:32.010
POPULATION PERCENTAGE OF

00:18:32.077 --> 00:18:33.312
AMERICORPS SLOTS THAT ARE

00:18:33.378 --> 00:18:35.113
AVAILABLE I'M NOT SAYING THAT

00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:37.182
THEY WOULDN'T BENEFIT FROM.

00:18:37.249 --> 00:18:39.284
THE EXPANSION OF THIS PROGRAM

00:18:39.351 --> 00:18:40.152
THE PARADISE FOLKS ARE NOT GOING

00:18:40.219 --> 00:18:41.453
TO PERMIT NO NO NO NO I'M I'M

00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:42.321
JUST LETTING YOU KNOW AS A

00:18:42.387 --> 00:18:43.822
COUNTY THAT WE'RE TRYING TO

00:18:43.889 --> 00:18:44.857
SERVE.

00:18:44.923 --> 00:18:46.058
AND AND THERE ARE THERE ARE SO

00:18:46.125 --> 00:18:47.559
MANY NEEDY COUNTIES FOR THIS

00:18:47.626 --> 00:18:48.594
RESOURCE.

00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:52.831
I DON'T DISAGREE WITH YOU SIR WE

00:18:52.898 --> 00:18:54.633
WE COULD AND SHOULD EXPAND THIS

00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:56.235
TO ALL HIGH NEED COUNTIES YOU

00:18:56.301 --> 00:18:57.603
KNOW HOWEVER WE WOULD WANTED TO

00:18:57.669 --> 00:18:58.637
FIND THIS.

00:18:58.704 --> 00:19:00.172
I THINK THIS WAS AN EFFORT ON

00:19:00.239 --> 00:19:01.473
THE GOVERNOR'S PARTED REALLY

00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:02.908
JUST TAKE.

00:19:02.975 --> 00:19:05.410
A LOOK AT A DECADES LONG PROB

00:19:05.477 --> 00:19:08.247
PROBLEM OF A LACK OF INVESTMENT

00:19:08.313 --> 00:19:10.415
A LACK OF CAPABILITY FROM ANY

00:19:10.482 --> 00:19:12.184
NON PROFITS IN THAT COMMUNITY

00:19:12.251 --> 00:19:13.886
AND SHEILA BOX WE CAN SPEAK AS

00:19:13.952 --> 00:19:15.087
SOMEONE WHO IS.

00:19:15.153 --> 00:19:17.155
WHO'S TRIED --

00:19:17.222 --> 00:19:18.924
TO PLACE PROGRAMS IN THAT

00:19:18.991 --> 00:19:21.994
COMMUNITY AND THESE THESE THIS-DESERT.

00:19:22.060 --> 00:19:24.530
AND HER CHALLENGES IN RAISING

00:19:24.596 --> 00:19:27.099
MATCH IT'S JUST BEEN SIGNIFICANT

00:19:27.165 --> 00:19:29.434
BUT I DON'T DISAGREE THERE'S

00:19:29.501 --> 00:19:30.435
OTHER NEEDS THAT ARE GOING ON

00:19:30.502 --> 00:19:32.471
THAT. TO YOUR POINT.

00:19:32.538 --> 00:19:37.276
BUT LET ME ASK ANALYST IS THAT.

00:19:37.342 --> 00:19:43.048
AS WE BUILD P. WEISS WE'RE

00:19:43.115 --> 00:19:44.683
CREATING FUTURE [inaudible]

00:19:44.750 --> 00:19:46.552
BUDGET OBLIGATIONS.

00:19:46.618 --> 00:19:48.754
AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS

00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:50.155
GOING TO DO SO MUCH.

00:19:50.222 --> 00:19:51.790
BUT TOO MANY TIMES CALIFORNIA

00:19:51.857 --> 00:19:53.759
DOES A GO IT ALONE OR GO BEYOND

00:19:53.825 --> 00:19:55.494
THE FEDERAL AND THAT DOESN'T

00:19:55.561 --> 00:19:58.230
THAT IMPACT OUR BUDGET TO SOME.

00:19:58.297 --> 00:20:01.567
SIGNIFICANT DEGREE ON OCCASION

00:20:01.633 --> 00:20:03.035
COULD THAT NOT BE THE CASE HERE.

00:20:03.101 --> 00:20:04.303
WE HAVE A KIND OF A CALIFORNIA

00:20:04.369 --> 00:20:07.406
LOAN PROGRAM.

00:20:07.472 --> 00:20:08.440
I'M NOT.

00:20:08.507 --> 00:20:09.741
SURE THAT THIS PROPOSED

00:20:09.808 --> 00:20:10.943
EXPANSION IS NECESSARILY

00:20:11.009 --> 00:20:12.844
CREATING KIND OF PERMANENT ANG

00:20:12.911 --> 00:20:15.180
GOING POSITIONS --

00:20:15.247 --> 00:20:16.748
IT WOULD BE COULD KIND OF KICK

00:20:16.815 --> 00:20:19.885
STARTING THESE NEW PROGRAMS --

00:20:19.952 --> 00:20:21.887
THAT WOULD HAVE A DEFINED

00:20:21.954 --> 00:20:23.422
TIMELINE AND AND THEN IF

00:20:23.488 --> 00:20:24.523
ADDITIONAL FUNDS WERE PROVIDED

00:20:24.590 --> 00:20:25.824
IN THE FUTURE --

00:20:25.891 --> 00:20:26.858
THAN THEY COULD CONTINUE MOVING

00:20:26.925 --> 00:20:28.627
FORWARD BUT I THINK THIS MONEY

00:20:28.694 --> 00:20:30.729
IS FOR KIND OF A DEFINED PROGRAM

00:20:30.796 --> 00:20:31.096
WITH A DEFINED.

00:20:31.163 --> 00:20:32.798
TIME I KNOW YOU I MEAN I GUESS

00:20:32.864 --> 00:20:34.566
IT'S ANOTHER QUESTION OF WHETHER

00:20:34.633 --> 00:20:35.067
OR NOT --

00:20:35.133 --> 00:20:36.535
PUTTING THIS FUNDING OUT THERE

00:20:36.602 --> 00:20:38.937
IN PARTICULAR SOME OF THE

00:20:39.004 --> 00:20:39.705
PARAMETERS AROUND THE LOCAL

00:20:39.771 --> 00:20:40.939
MATCH OTHER THINGS WHETHER OR

00:20:41.006 --> 00:20:42.107
NOT THAT CHANGES KIND OF THE

00:20:42.174 --> 00:20:42.908
PRESIDENT.

00:20:42.975 --> 00:20:44.276
MOVING FORWARD THE GRANTEES WILL

00:20:44.343 --> 00:20:45.277
EXPECT -- I

00:20:45.344 --> 00:20:47.446
THINK THAT THAT'S AN OPEN

00:20:47.512 --> 00:20:49.281
QUESTION AND ONE THAT ARE GOING

00:20:49.348 --> 00:20:49.915
TO BE.

00:20:49.982 --> 00:20:51.883
LIMITED TERM P. WISE OR

00:20:51.950 --> 00:20:53.452
PERMANENT P. WISE BECAUSE THAT'S

00:20:53.518 --> 00:20:54.820
IMPORTANT RIGHT THERE THEY'RE

00:20:54.886 --> 00:20:58.323
NOT SPECIFICALLY P. WISE ITS

00:20:58.390 --> 00:21:01.426
INVESTMENT --

00:21:01.493 --> 00:21:03.161
TO IT IS ONE YEAR FUNDING THAT

00:21:03.228 --> 00:21:04.529
CAN BE SPENT OVER A TWO YEAR

THE LINGUISTIC MAKE UP OF THAT

00:28:01.012 --> 00:28:02.047

00:28:03.815 --> 00:28:04.916
WHICH IN OUR CASE IS USUALLY

00:28:04.983 --> 00:28:06.184
SEVERAL YEARS BECAUSE THEY CAN

00:28:06.251 --> 00:28:07.786

00:29:30.969 --> 00:29:33.238
A PRETTY BIG TRUCK TO BE ABLE TO

TO ADDRESS FOR THEM.

00:29:34.272 --> 00:29:35.607

MORE AND MORE BECAUSE THIS IS A

00:29:48.586 --> 00:29:50.788
REALLY GREAT WAY TO PROVIDE

SERVICES COST EFFICIENTLY.

00:29:52.524 --> 00:29:54.726
BUT EFFECTIVELY WHILE ENGAGING

00:29:54.792 --> 00:29:56.161
THE COMMUNITIES WHO NEED THE

00:29:56.227 --> 00:29:57.729
SERVICES NOT DROPPING INTO DOING

00:29:57.795 --> 00:30:01.299
SOMETHING FOR THEM AND THEN

00:30:01.366 --> 00:30:02.667
WALKING AWAY.

I'M NOT SURE HOW WE DO THIS OR

00:30:20.051 --> 00:30:21.452
HOW YOU DO THIS BUT I I DO THINK

00:30:21.519 --> 00:30:23.821
THERE'S SOME VALUE OF TAKING A

00:30:23.888 --> 00:30:25.223
YOUNG PERSON FROM ORANGE COUNTY.

00:30:25.290 --> 00:30:27.158

CENTRAL VALLEY --

00:30:28.793 --> 00:30:29.827
AND I THINK THAT THERE'S SOME

00:30:29.894 --> 00:30:30.862
MUTUAL BENEFIT THERE I'M NOT

00:30:30.929 --> 00:30:33.932

00:30:33.998 --> 00:30:34.732
TWO IMPORTANT GOALS BUT JUST

00:30:34.799 --> 00:30:38.670

RECRUITMENT --

00:30:45.109 --> 00:30:47.745
OF THEIR MEMBERS SO WHAT'S --

00:30:47.812 --> 00:30:49.347
INTERESTING IS THERE ARE SOME

00:30:49.414 --> 00:30:52.217
PROGRAMS THAT MAY CHOOSE TO

00:30:52.283 --> 00:30:54.285
FOCUS PRIMARILY ON RECRUITS FROM

00:30:54.352 --> 00:30:55.753

STATEWIDE OR EVEN NATIONALLY SO

00:31:00.225 --> 00:31:02.493
THAT ISN'T A REQUIREMENT THAT IT

00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:04.028
COME FROM THE LOCAL COMMUNITY

00:31:04.095 --> 00:31:05.797

REGIONAL ACTION PLANS WILL

00:54:48.752 --> 00:54:49.986
IDENTIFY PROCESS IMPROVEMENTS

00:54:50.053 --> 00:54:51.521
BARRIERS TO PRODUCTION.

00:54:51.588 --> 00:54:53.256
AND OTHER ACTIVITIES NECESSARY

00:54:53.323 --> 00:54:54.991
TO INCREASE PRODUCTION.

00:54:55.058 --> 00:54:56.259
THE PLAN WILL ALSO IDENTIFY THE

00:54:56.326 --> 00:54:58.028
METHODOLOGY THAT WILL BE USED TO

00:54:58.094 --> 00:54:59.829
DETERMINE PRODUCTION REWARD

00:54:59.896 --> 00:55:01.264
AMOUNTS FOR JURISDICTIONS.

00:55:01.331 --> 00:55:02.666
IF A JURISDICTION IS IN A REGION

00:55:02.732 --> 00:55:04.334
OR COUNTY THAT IS NOT SUBMITTED

00:55:04.401 --> 00:55:06.102
A PLAN THE KIDS WITH THEIR OWN

METHODOLOGY TO DISTRIBUTE

INCENTIVE AWARDS TO THESE

00:55:13.209 --> 00:55:14.544
JURISDICTIONS.

00:55:14.611 --> 00:55:16.012
FINALLY THE REGIONAL PLAN IS THE

00:55:16.079 --> 00:55:17.313
MOST CRITICAL COMPONENT.

00:55:17.380 --> 00:55:19.416
OF THIS WE WANT TO INCENT LOCALS

00:55:19.482 --> 00:55:21.551
AND REGIONS TO WORK TOGETHER TO

00:55:21.618 --> 00:55:22.986
MEET THE INCREASED PRODUCTION

00:55:23.053 --> 00:55:24.721
AND INDICATE HOW THEY INTEND TO

00:55:24.788 --> 00:55:26.056
ACHIEVE THESE GOALS.

00:55:26.122 --> 00:55:27.557
REGION'S WILL DETERMINE THE

00:55:27.624 --> 00:55:30.427
METHODOLOGY TO AGREED UPON

00:55:30.493 --> 00:55:31.661
ACTIVITIES.

00:55:31.728 --> 00:55:33.496
AND I'D BE HAPPY TO TAKE ANY

00:55:33.563 --> 00:55:35.565
QUESTIONS IF YOU HAVE ANY

00:55:35.632 --> 00:55:35.865
[inaudible]

00:55:35.932 --> 00:55:37.734
OKAY.

00:55:37.801 --> 00:55:39.402
THE THE ADMINISTRATION'S A

00:55:39.469 --> 00:55:40.136
PROPOSED ON THE SERVER IT

00:55:40.203 --> 00:55:41.871
INCLUDES SEVERAL PIECES SOME

00:55:41.938 --> 00:55:43.573
THAT ARE AIMED AT INCREASING

00:55:43.640 --> 00:55:44.708
HOUSING PRODUCTION IN THE SHORT

00:55:44.774 --> 00:55:45.742
TERM AND SOME.

00:55:45.809 --> 00:55:46.910
AND INCREASING --

00:55:46.976 --> 00:55:48.044
PRODUCTION IN THE LONG TERM AS

00:55:48.111 --> 00:55:50.513
FAR AS THE SHORT TERM COMPONENTS.

00:55:50.580 --> 00:55:52.182
WE HAVE SEVERAL CONCERNS WITH

00:55:52.248 --> 00:55:53.750
THESE PROPOSALS --

00:55:53.817 --> 00:55:56.152
THE FIRST IS THAT THE STRATEGY

00:55:56.219 --> 00:55:57.520
THAT'S PROPOSED AN ESTABLISHING

00:55:57.587 --> 00:55:59.723
THE SHORT TERM GOALS A SEEMS TO

00:55:59.789 --> 00:56:01.391
BE A CONTINUATION OF THE STATE'S

00:56:01.458 --> 00:56:03.660
EXISTING STRATEGY THAT IT'S HAD.

00:56:03.727 --> 00:56:04.861
FOR A SEVERAL YEARS THROUGH THE

00:56:04.928 --> 00:56:06.029
HOUSING ELEMENT AND REGIONAL

00:56:06.096 --> 00:56:08.832
HOUSING NEEDS ALLOCATION ARENA

00:56:08.898 --> 00:56:09.666
PROCESS.

00:56:09.733 --> 00:56:10.900
IN OTHER IT'S NOT CLEAR THIS

00:56:10.967 --> 00:56:12.469
PROPOSAL KIND OF DIFFERENTIATES

00:56:12.535 --> 00:56:13.503
ITSELF FROM THAT PASSED STRATEGY

00:56:13.570 --> 00:56:14.070
THAT --

00:56:14.137 --> 00:56:16.172
RESEARCH BY OUR OFFICE AND

00:56:16.239 --> 00:56:18.241
ACADEMIC RESEARCHERS HAS FOUND

00:56:18.308 --> 00:56:21.211
HAS BEEN GENERALLY INEFFECTIVE

00:56:21.277 --> 00:56:22.345
IN ACHIEVING ITS GOALS.

00:56:22.412 --> 00:56:23.780
AND BECAUSE OF THAT WE WOULD

00:56:23.847 --> 00:56:24.948
SUGGEST THAT INSTEAD OF FOCUSING

00:56:25.014 --> 00:56:27.717
ON THESE SHORT TERM CHANGES A WE

00:56:27.784 --> 00:56:29.919
WE GREW THE ADMINISTRATION ALSO

00:56:29.986 --> 00:56:32.956
THAT THAT FOCUSING ON WAYS TO

00:56:33.022 --> 00:56:34.758
FURTHER IMPROVE THE EXISTING

00:56:34.824 --> 00:56:36.192
LONG TERM PLANNING STRUCTURE.

00:56:36.259 --> 00:56:37.527
A WOULD BE A BETTER USE OF THE

00:56:37.594 --> 00:56:38.962
LEGISLATURE'S EFFORT IN THIS

00:56:39.028 --> 00:56:41.197
AREA OUR OTHER CONCERN IS WITH

00:56:41.264 --> 00:56:42.532
THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION AND

00:56:42.599 --> 00:56:44.667
FUNDING SET ASIDE FOR A KIND OF

00:56:44.734 --> 00:56:46.603
INCENTIVE FUNDS TO CITIES AND

00:56:46.669 --> 00:56:47.303
COUNTIES.

00:56:47.370 --> 00:56:49.439
OF THE STATE HAS A TRIED SIMILAR

00:56:49.506 --> 00:56:50.940
APPROACHES IN THE PAST OF MAKING

00:56:51.007 --> 00:56:53.343
POTS OF FUNDING AVAILABLE FOR

00:56:53.409 --> 00:56:56.045
JURISDICTIONS TO ENCOURAGE THEM --

00:56:56.112 --> 00:56:56.646
TO APPROVE A PLAN FOR TO PROVE

00:56:56.713 --> 00:57:01.017
HOW REVIEW OF THIS PAST PROGRAMS --

00:57:01.084 --> 00:57:01.851
DOESN'T --

00:57:01.918 --> 00:57:04.053
DOESN'T SUGGEST THAT THEY HAD A

00:57:04.120 --> 00:57:05.822
A SIGNIFICANT MEASURABLE IMPACT

00:57:05.889 --> 00:57:07.457
ON THOSE LOCAL APPROVALS OF

00:57:07.524 --> 00:57:09.392
HOUSING BECAUSE OF THIS.

00:57:09.459 --> 00:57:10.226
WE THINK THAT THIS FIVE HUNDRED

00:57:10.293 --> 00:57:11.227
MILLION COULD ESSENTIALLY BE A

00:57:11.294 --> 00:57:13.563
PRETTY RISKY BET FROM THE

00:57:13.630 --> 00:57:14.964
LEGISLATURE'S PERSPECTIVE --

00:57:15.031 --> 00:57:16.399
YOU KNOW AN ALTERNATIVE USE OF

00:57:16.466 --> 00:57:17.734
THIS FUNDS FOR EXAMPLE --

00:57:17.801 --> 00:57:19.469
ALLOCATING THE FUNDING DIRECTLY

00:57:19.536 --> 00:57:20.837
FOR SUBSIDIES FOR CONSTRUCTION

00:57:20.904 --> 00:57:21.905
OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING WOULD

00:57:21.971 --> 00:57:23.740
YIELD A MORE CERTAIN BENEFIT

00:57:23.807 --> 00:57:25.341
MAYBE SOMETHING LIKE FIVE

00:57:25.408 --> 00:57:27.343
THOUSAND ADDITIONAL FOR DOUBLE

00:57:27.410 --> 00:57:28.611
UNITS ACROSS THE STATE --

00:57:28.678 --> 00:57:29.979
WALL WERE SKEPTICAL OF THE KIND

00:57:30.046 --> 00:57:31.114
OF THE SHORT TERM APPROACHES

00:57:31.181 --> 00:57:34.117
PRESENTED BY THE THE GOVERNOR WE

00:57:34.184 --> 00:57:35.318
DO AGREE.

00:57:35.385 --> 00:57:37.086
THAT IT WOULD BE WORTHWHILE.

00:57:37.153 --> 00:57:38.588
TO CONTINUE TO RETHINK THE LONG

00:57:38.655 --> 00:57:39.722
TERM PLANNING PROCESS SEES THE

00:57:39.789 --> 00:57:41.691
LEGISLATURE HAS TAKEN SEVERAL

00:57:41.758 --> 00:57:43.993
IMPORTANT STEPS IN THIS AREA IN

00:57:44.060 --> 00:57:45.061
RECENT YEARS.

00:57:45.128 --> 00:57:46.062
BUT WE DO THINK THAT THERE

00:57:46.129 --> 00:57:47.497
CONTINUE TO BE OPPORTUNITIES FOR

00:57:47.564 --> 00:57:49.199
ADDITIONAL IMPROVEMENT --

00:57:49.265 --> 00:57:51.100
AND WE DID ISSUE A REPORT ABOUT

00:57:51.167 --> 00:57:52.936
A MONTH AGO WERE WE OUTLINED A

00:57:53.002 --> 00:57:53.903
SEVERAL SUGGESTIONS THAT WE

00:57:53.970 --> 00:57:54.704
THINK WE TAKE IN THE

00:57:54.771 --> 00:57:56.339
CONSIDERATION OF FURTHER

00:57:56.406 --> 00:57:58.107
DISCUSSIONS FOR REFORMS. TO

00:57:58.174 --> 00:57:59.375
THOSE PLANNING PROCESSES AND I'D

00:57:59.442 --> 00:58:00.977
BE HAPPY TO GO INTO THOSE IF THE

00:58:01.044 --> 00:58:02.445
KID SUBCOMMITTEE.

00:58:02.512 --> 00:58:04.414
WOULD BE INTERESTED ONE TO SPEAK

00:58:04.480 --> 00:58:05.882
TO ONE PARTICULAR ELEMENT OF THE

00:58:05.949 --> 00:58:08.618
THE GOVERNOR'S LONG TERM CHANGES.

00:58:08.685 --> 00:58:13.323
ARE THE MINISTRATIONS PROPOSED --

00:58:13.389 --> 00:58:14.057
TYING.

00:58:14.123 --> 00:58:15.825
SB ONE LOCAL STREETS AND ROADS

00:58:15.892 --> 00:58:19.362
OF FUNDING TO A PROGRESS TOWARDS.

00:58:19.429 --> 00:58:21.064
MEETING THESE KIND OF LONG TERM.

00:58:21.130 --> 00:58:23.800
PLANNING GOALS --

00:58:23.867 --> 00:58:25.635
IN WALL --

00:58:25.702 --> 00:58:29.138
WELL WE AGREE THAT THIS IS A THE

00:58:29.205 --> 00:58:30.907
STATE DISCRETIONARY POT THAT THE

00:58:30.974 --> 00:58:33.243
STATE ALLOCATES AT THE CITIES.

00:58:33.309 --> 00:58:35.845
AND IN THAT RESPECT IT IT IT

00:58:35.912 --> 00:58:37.847
DOES PROVIDE A SIGNIFICANT

00:58:37.914 --> 00:58:39.115
OPPORTUNITY FROM THE STATE'S

00:58:39.182 --> 00:58:40.416
PERSPECTIVE IN TERMS OF IF WE

00:58:40.483 --> 00:58:41.951
ARE INTERESTED IN SHIFTING THE

00:58:42.018 --> 00:58:43.820
INCENTIVES AT THE LOCAL LEVEL IN

00:58:43.887 --> 00:58:44.587
THE AREA.

00:58:44.654 --> 00:58:47.257
OF HOUSING BUT AT THE SAME TIME

00:58:47.323 --> 00:58:48.992
THIS APPROACH COULD PRESENT

00:58:49.058 --> 00:58:51.194
SEVERAL DRAWBACKS.

00:58:51.261 --> 00:58:52.528
THE FIRST IS THAT --

00:58:52.595 --> 00:58:54.697
TYING.

00:58:54.764 --> 00:58:57.667
TYING THE SB ONE ALLOCATIONS TO

00:58:57.734 --> 00:59:00.937
A PROGRESS IN THE RENO PROCESS.

00:59:01.004 --> 00:59:02.438
SENSUALLY COULD BE ESSENTIALLY

00:59:02.505 --> 00:59:04.574
HOLDING CITIES AND COUNTIES

00:59:04.641 --> 00:59:06.309
ACCOUNTABLE FOR FACTORS THAT IN

00:59:06.376 --> 00:59:08.711
SOME CASES ARE BEYOND THEIR

00:59:08.778 --> 00:59:09.712
CONTROL --

00:59:09.779 --> 00:59:11.247
AND THIS IS PARTICULARLY TRUE IF

00:59:11.314 --> 00:59:13.983
THE SP ONE FUNDS ARE TIED TO

00:59:14.050 --> 00:59:16.185
MEETING PARTICULAR PRODUCTION --

00:59:16.252 --> 00:59:19.088
TARGETS --

00:59:19.155 --> 00:59:20.757
NO IN LOOKING AT THE DETAILS OF

00:59:20.823 --> 00:59:22.125
THE THE TRAILER BILL THAT THE

00:59:22.191 --> 00:59:24.027
ADMINISTRATION HAS PROPOSED IN

00:59:24.093 --> 00:59:25.828
THIS AREA IT APPEARS THAT THEY

00:59:25.895 --> 00:59:27.797
ARE ATTEMPTING TO TRY TO

00:59:27.864 --> 00:59:28.965
MITIGATE SOME OF THAT ISSUE.

00:59:29.032 --> 00:59:32.268
BY TYING THE SB ONE FUNDING MORE

00:59:32.335 --> 00:59:34.037
TO PROGRESS TOWARDS UP KIND OF

00:59:34.103 --> 00:59:35.438
PLANE ANGLES HAVING TO COMPLY

00:59:35.505 --> 00:59:36.940
HOUSING ELEMENT IN MAKING ZONING

00:59:37.006 --> 00:59:39.676
CHANGES BUT IT APPEARS AT LEAST --

00:59:39.742 --> 00:59:41.678
IN THE TRAILER BILL HERE --

00:59:41.744 --> 00:59:42.979
THAT THEY ARE KIND OF STOPPING

00:59:43.046 --> 00:59:45.114
SHORT AT LEAST NOW OF TYING IT

00:59:45.181 --> 00:59:46.349
DIRECTLY TO MEETING CERTAIN

00:59:46.416 --> 00:59:47.951
PRODUCTION GOALS SO THAT THE THE

00:59:48.017 --> 00:59:49.118
MINISTRATION MAYBE TAKEN SOME

00:59:49.185 --> 00:59:50.153
STEPS TO MITIGATE SOME OF THE

00:59:50.219 --> 00:59:51.120
CONCERNS THERE.

00:59:51.187 --> 00:59:53.756
ANOTHER ISSUE THOUGH IS THAT.

00:59:53.823 --> 00:59:54.891
YOU KNOW THIS PART OF FUNDING

00:59:54.958 --> 00:59:56.659
OBVIOUSLY WAS SET FORTH BY THE

00:59:56.726 --> 00:59:57.760
LEGISLATURE AND APPROVED BY THE

00:59:57.827 --> 00:59:59.896
VOTERS TO MEET ONE PURPOSE WHICH

00:59:59.963 --> 01:00:01.030
IS THE MAINTENANCE OF LOCAL

01:00:01.097 --> 01:00:02.498
STREETS AND ROADS --

01:00:02.565 --> 01:00:07.470
AND THAT BY TYING IT.

01:00:07.537 --> 01:00:10.573
YEAH THAT MAY IN NO IN GENERAL.

01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:11.641
INCREASING THE APPROVAL OF

01:00:11.708 --> 01:00:12.875
HOUSING ACROSS THE STATE MAY BE

01:00:12.942 --> 01:00:15.078
WORTHWHILE BUT ATTEMPTING TO DO

01:00:15.144 --> 01:00:16.346
BOTH OF THESE GOALS WITH ONE

01:00:16.412 --> 01:00:18.414
PART OF FUNDING KIND OF REDUCES

01:00:18.481 --> 01:00:20.316
THE STATE'S ABILITY TO ACHIEVE

01:00:20.383 --> 01:00:22.418
BOTH OF THOSE GOALS [inaudible]

01:00:22.485 --> 01:00:25.288
YES.

01:00:25.355 --> 01:00:26.489
ANALYSTS IS BROUGHT UP A POINT

01:00:26.556 --> 01:00:29.058
IT WAS IT IS MY INTENT TO SPEAK

01:00:29.125 --> 01:00:31.027
A LOT ABOUT.

01:00:31.094 --> 01:00:33.563
AS WE PROCEED TO THE BUDGET.

01:00:33.629 --> 01:00:37.433
THE IDEA OF PUNITIVE ACTION.

01:00:37.500 --> 01:00:40.136
WITH SB ONE FUNDS TO CITIES AND

01:00:40.203 --> 01:00:40.803
COUNTIES.

01:00:40.870 --> 01:00:43.172
IS A SERIOUS SERIOUS BREACH OF

01:00:43.239 --> 01:00:46.275
PROMISE AND FAITH. TO THE VOTERS.

01:00:46.342 --> 01:00:47.810
WE WERE TOLD [inaudible]

01:00:47.877 --> 01:00:50.179
IN.

01:00:50.246 --> 01:00:52.915
AND SB ONE AND THEN THEY

01:00:52.982 --> 01:00:54.384
REJECTED THE REFERENDUM.

01:00:54.450 --> 01:00:55.852
THAT MONEY IS GOING TO BE GOING

01:00:55.918 --> 01:00:57.453
TO YOU.

01:00:57.520 --> 01:00:59.989
AND NOW TO THREATEN TO WITHDRAW

01:01:00.056 --> 01:01:01.624
THAT.

01:01:01.691 --> 01:01:03.326
IF THEY DON'T MEET HOUSING GOALS

01:01:03.393 --> 01:01:04.927
AND I'M GONNA TALK A LOT MORE

01:01:04.994 --> 01:01:06.396
ABOUT THAT AS WE PROCEED.

01:01:06.462 --> 01:01:08.064
THAT'S UNCONSCIONABLE

01:01:08.131 --> 01:01:08.364
[inaudible]

01:01:08.431 --> 01:01:12.502
AND IF THIS IS TO HAPPEN.

01:01:12.568 --> 01:01:14.504
IT OUGHT NOT HAPPEN SIMPLY IN A

01:01:14.570 --> 01:01:16.472
TRAILER BILL.

01:01:16.539 --> 01:01:17.874
TRAILER BILLS HAVE BECOME A VERY

01:01:17.940 --> 01:01:20.009
CORRUPT WAY TO IMPLEMENT THE

01:01:20.076 --> 01:01:21.844
BUDGET.

01:01:21.911 --> 01:01:23.913
AND MY FEAR.

01:01:23.980 --> 01:01:25.681
AND THAT'S WHY BRING IT UP EVERY

01:01:25.748 --> 01:01:27.016
CHANCE I GET.

01:01:27.083 --> 01:01:29.719
THAT IDEAS LIKE THIS TEND TO

01:01:29.786 --> 01:01:30.887
JUST SLIP IN.

01:01:30.953 --> 01:01:32.288
THE TRAILER BILLS.

01:01:32.355 --> 01:01:33.322
THE LEGISLATURE NOW IS DOING

01:01:33.389 --> 01:01:36.325
MAJOR POLICY EVERY YEAR

01:01:36.392 --> 01:01:38.161
SUBSTANTIAL.

01:01:38.227 --> 01:01:39.562
AND TRAILER BILLS.

01:01:39.629 --> 01:01:41.998
AND EVERY YEAR WE ENTERTAIN MORE

01:01:42.065 --> 01:01:43.599
TRAILER BILLS I THINK WE'RE UP

01:01:43.666 --> 01:01:44.567
TO SEVENTY ONE POSSIBLE THIS

01:01:44.634 --> 01:01:45.001
YEAR.

01:01:45.068 --> 01:01:46.602
IT WON'T END UP BEING THAT MANY

01:01:46.669 --> 01:01:48.304
BUT IT'S CERTAINLY GOING TO BE

01:01:48.371 --> 01:01:50.373
AND THEN IN THE FORTIES.

01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:52.141
WE HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL.

01:01:52.208 --> 01:01:53.810
AND THERE HAVE BEEN OCCASIONS.

01:01:53.876 --> 01:01:54.577
SEVERAL.

01:01:54.644 --> 01:01:56.846
WHERE I'M SITTING ON A

01:01:56.913 --> 01:01:58.848
SUBCOMMITTEE OF THE BUDGET?

01:01:58.915 --> 01:02:00.016
AND THAT'S THE ONLY COMMITTEE

01:02:00.083 --> 01:02:02.485
WERE THIS MAJOR POLICY ISSUES

01:02:02.552 --> 01:02:05.054
GOING TO BE DISCUSSED.

01:02:05.121 --> 01:02:05.788
NOW THE ONE THAT.

01:02:05.855 --> 01:02:06.823
ANALYSTS SUGGEST WILL BE

01:02:06.889 --> 01:02:08.991
DISCUSSED A LOT OF OTHER PLACES

01:02:09.058 --> 01:02:10.059
I SURE YOU.

01:02:10.126 --> 01:02:11.828
BUT THAT'S NOT THE POINT WE HAVE

01:02:11.894 --> 01:02:13.729
TO BE VERY CAUTIOUS.

01:02:13.796 --> 01:02:15.698
ABOUT PROCESS. TO ENSURE THE

01:02:15.765 --> 01:02:17.066
PEOPLE CALIFORNIA KNOW WHAT'S

01:02:17.133 --> 01:02:22.171
GOING ON AND THE DAYS THE LOOSE

01:02:22.238 --> 01:02:22.839
WAY THAT WE USE TRAILER BILLS IS

01:02:22.905 --> 01:02:25.374
CERTAINLY PROBLEMATIC BUT

01:02:25.441 --> 01:02:27.243
GETTING BACK TO THIS POINT.

01:02:27.310 --> 01:02:28.244
I THINK WE DID A VERY GOOD TREAD

01:02:28.311 --> 01:02:30.680
VERY SOFTLY.

01:02:30.746 --> 01:02:32.448
ON ANY PUNITIVE ACTION.

01:02:32.515 --> 01:02:34.584
TOWARDS AREAS THAT DON'T MEET

01:02:34.650 --> 01:02:37.353
THEIR HOUSING REQUIREMENTS.

01:02:37.420 --> 01:02:38.621
IN ANOTHER ITEM I'M GOING TO

01:02:38.688 --> 01:02:40.423
EMPHASIZE A POINT THAT WILL

01:02:40.490 --> 01:02:41.757
RELATE TO THIS.

01:02:41.824 --> 01:02:43.860
THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR FOR A LET

01:02:43.926 --> 01:02:48.464
ME [inaudible] TO THAT.

01:02:48.531 --> 01:02:50.166
THANKS OF A FOLLOW ON THE CENTER

01:02:50.233 --> 01:02:52.435
NIELSEN QUESTION SO TELL ME HOW

01:02:52.502 --> 01:02:53.736
EXPLAINED TO VOTERS.

01:02:53.803 --> 01:02:56.339
THAT VOTED FOR SB.

01:02:56.405 --> 01:02:58.875
ONE THE NEXUS BETWEEN HOUSING IN

01:02:58.941 --> 01:03:03.679
AND WHAT THEY VOTED FOR AND SB.

01:03:03.746 --> 01:03:04.547
ONE SO WE BELIEVE THAT THERE'S A

01:03:04.614 --> 01:03:05.915
VERY STRONG NEXUS BETWEEN

01:03:05.982 --> 01:03:06.682
HOUSING AND TRANSPORTATION

01:03:06.749 --> 01:03:08.518
OBVIOUSLY NEED THE ROADS TO GET

01:03:08.584 --> 01:03:10.286
TO YOUR HOUSE AND TO YOUR WORK --

01:03:10.353 --> 01:03:11.387
BUT I DO WANT TO KNOW THAT TO

01:03:11.454 --> 01:03:13.055
THE SENATOR'S COMMENTS THAT WE

01:03:13.122 --> 01:03:14.824
HAVE WRITTEN IN A STAKEHOLDER

01:03:14.891 --> 01:03:16.526
PROCESS TO UNDERGO AN TO REVIEW

01:03:16.592 --> 01:03:17.727
THE TYPES OF FUNDS THAT WILL BE

01:03:17.793 --> 01:03:18.761
ELIGIBLE.

01:03:18.828 --> 01:03:20.429
WE'VE SPECIFICALLY IDENTIFIED

01:03:20.496 --> 01:03:21.931
THAT THIS PARTICULAR FUND

01:03:21.998 --> 01:03:24.967
HOWEVER I WOULD NOTE THAT THE

01:03:25.034 --> 01:03:27.937
THE REQUIRE.

01:03:28.004 --> 01:03:29.272
FACE CAN NOT HAVE THOSE FUNDS

01:03:29.338 --> 01:03:30.873
WITH HELD OUR ACTUAL

01:03:30.940 --> 01:03:32.241
REQUIREMENTS NOW THEIR CURRENT

01:03:32.308 --> 01:03:34.143
LAW THAT JURISDICTION'S ARE

01:03:34.210 --> 01:03:35.645
REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH ITS NOT

01:03:35.711 --> 01:03:37.346
ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS AND IT'S

01:03:37.413 --> 01:03:38.814
NOT PRODUCTION.

01:03:38.881 --> 01:03:40.850
GOALS AT THIS TIME SO SANTA THE

01:03:40.917 --> 01:03:42.552
CONCERNED HOW YOU DO EXPLAINED I

01:03:42.618 --> 01:03:43.986
WOULD SAY THAT THERE'S GOING TO

01:03:44.053 --> 01:03:45.421
BE INVOLVED STAKEHOLDER PROCESS

01:03:45.488 --> 01:03:47.590
AN OPPORTUNITY FOR LOCALS TO BE

01:03:47.657 --> 01:03:49.659
IN COMPLIANCE BEFORE THOSE FUNDS

01:03:49.725 --> 01:03:51.060
ARE WITHOUT.

01:03:51.127 --> 01:03:52.128
OKAY SO WHEN THE VOERS SAYS

01:03:52.195 --> 01:03:54.063
LOOK AT I THOUGHT SB ONE WAS

01:03:54.130 --> 01:03:55.731
ABOUT ROAD IMPROVEMENTS.

01:03:55.798 --> 01:03:57.533
AND I SEE THAT THE STATE IS

01:03:57.600 --> 01:03:58.935
USING IT FOR LEISURE ALL

01:03:59.001 --> 01:04:01.337
IMPORTANT I MEAN HOUSING IS VERY

01:04:01.404 --> 01:04:02.038
IMPORTANT.

01:04:02.104 --> 01:04:05.107
BOB USING FOR HOUSING

01:04:05.174 --> 01:04:05.408
[inaudible]

01:04:05.474 --> 01:04:06.275
AGAIN HOW.

01:04:06.342 --> 01:04:07.109
TELL ME I I GOT THE WHOLE

01:04:07.176 --> 01:04:08.477
STAKEHOLDER THING AND OTHERS ARE

01:04:08.544 --> 01:04:09.345
GOING.

01:04:09.412 --> 01:04:12.215
TO TALK ABOUT IT BUT YOU KNOW.

01:04:12.281 --> 01:04:13.549
TO THE VOTER IN GARDEN GROVE WHO

01:04:13.616 --> 01:04:15.785
VOTED FOR SB ONE BECAUSE FOLKS

01:04:15.851 --> 01:04:18.454
TOLD THAT PERSON THAT IT WAS

01:04:18.521 --> 01:04:20.389
GONNA BE USED TO ROADS. EIGHT I

01:04:20.456 --> 01:04:21.657
NEED THE THIRTY SECOND

01:04:21.724 --> 01:04:25.394
EXPLANATION AS TO WHAT THAT.

01:04:25.461 --> 01:04:27.530
NECKLACES ACKLES THAT DEBBIE DR

01:04:27.597 --> 01:04:28.598
HOUSING POLICY THE CIA JUST

01:04:28.664 --> 01:04:30.566
WANNA QUICK TOP LINE THIS IS TWO

01:04:30.633 --> 01:04:31.133
DIFFERENT PEOPLE'S RIGHT THE

01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:31.968
SHORT TERM SELECT OPTION AND

01:04:32.034 --> 01:04:33.903
THIS LONGER TERM SO THAT

01:04:33.970 --> 01:04:34.537
EVERYTHING WOULD THAT WOULD BE

01:04:34.604 --> 01:04:36.105
DISCUSSED MEDICAL POSSIBLE COME

01:04:36.172 --> 01:04:37.073
BACK TO YOU OFFER

01:04:37.139 --> 01:04:38.140
RECOMMENDATIONS IN ORDER TO

01:04:38.207 --> 01:04:39.242
ADOPT RIGHT.

01:04:39.308 --> 01:04:41.010
SO THERE'S A BLANK THE PROCESS

01:04:41.077 --> 01:04:43.679
BY WHICH ANY CONCERN VOTER COULD

01:04:43.746 --> 01:04:45.181
RAISE OR YOU KNOW THROUGHOUT

01:04:45.248 --> 01:04:46.949
THROUGHOUT THAT PROCESS AND TO

01:04:47.016 --> 01:04:47.483
BE ABLE.

01:04:47.550 --> 01:04:49.385
ROBUST DISCUSSION ABOUT WHETHER

01:04:49.452 --> 01:04:50.686
THAT MADE SENSE IN TERMS OF

01:04:50.753 --> 01:04:51.887
TRYING OTHER.

01:04:51.954 --> 01:04:53.422
YOU KNOW COMPLY TO OTHER STATE

01:04:53.489 --> 01:04:54.890
HOUSING LAWS TO CERTAIN FUNDING

01:04:54.957 --> 01:04:56.325
SOURCE SO I THINK THAT'S AN

01:04:56.392 --> 01:04:57.159
IMPORTANT POINT TO MAKE IN A

01:04:57.226 --> 01:04:58.628
MULTI YEAR DISCUSSION PROCESS

01:04:58.694 --> 01:05:00.496
NOTHING'S HAPPENING NOW IN THIS

01:05:00.563 --> 01:05:02.798
TRAILER BILL TO ENACT THAT.

01:05:02.865 --> 01:05:06.102
SO. TO THAT POINT RIGHT THERE

01:05:06.168 --> 01:05:08.904
ARE --

01:05:08.971 --> 01:05:11.173
COMPLIANCE WITH HAVING ABOUT

01:05:11.240 --> 01:05:12.174
HOUSING ELEMENT FOR LOTS OF

01:05:12.241 --> 01:05:14.377
HOUSING RESOURCES AND EVEN FOR

01:05:14.443 --> 01:05:14.944
ALREADY FOR SB ONE PLANNING

01:05:15.011 --> 01:05:15.611
GRANTS.

01:05:15.678 --> 01:05:17.280
THAT'S A THRESHOLD REQUIREMENT

01:05:17.346 --> 01:05:18.714
SO THIS IS A WHAT DOES SEEM YOU

01:05:18.781 --> 01:05:20.216
KNOW OBVIOUSLY A LOT OF THE

01:05:20.283 --> 01:05:23.419
CONVERSATIONS BEEN AROUND IN OH

01:05:23.486 --> 01:05:24.020
WOW THIS ONE IS GONNA TAKE ME

01:05:24.086 --> 01:05:25.321
THERE ACTUALLY IS A PRECEDENT

01:05:25.388 --> 01:05:27.023
FOR US TO SAY HEY YOU NEED TO BE

01:05:27.089 --> 01:05:27.723
COMPLIANT WITH CERTAIN ASPECTS

01:05:27.790 --> 01:05:29.158
OF HOUSING LAW.

01:05:29.225 --> 01:05:31.093
TRANSPORTATION LAW THAT EXISTS

01:05:31.160 --> 01:05:32.194
BECAUSE THEY ARE INTERCONNECTED

01:05:32.261 --> 01:05:34.997
IN THE PLANNING PROCESS RIGHT SO

01:05:35.064 --> 01:05:36.465
IF YOU'RE YOU'RE.

01:05:36.532 --> 01:05:37.366
YOUNG COMING YOUR NOSE AT LIKE

01:05:37.433 --> 01:05:38.634
THE HOUSING CORRECTION PROCESS

01:05:38.701 --> 01:05:39.235
BUT YOU WANT THOSE

01:05:39.302 --> 01:05:40.503
TRANSPORTATION DOLLARS OR VICE

01:05:40.569 --> 01:05:42.538
VERSA RIGHT --

01:05:42.605 --> 01:05:43.773
THAT COULD BE A ROBE A PART OF

01:05:43.839 --> 01:05:44.807
THE ROBUST DISCUSSION CYCLIC

01:05:44.874 --> 01:05:46.242
PROCESS BUT I THINK THE ANSWER

01:05:46.309 --> 01:05:47.810
IS NOTHING IS BEING DONE RIGHT

01:05:47.877 --> 01:05:49.545
NOW WE WANT TO DISCUSS THOSE IN

01:05:49.612 --> 01:05:51.614
A REAL HOLISTIC AND TRANSPARENT

01:05:51.681 --> 01:05:51.814
WAY.

01:05:51.881 --> 01:05:53.082
IN A LONG TERM PROCESS NO I I

01:05:53.149 --> 01:05:58.154
THINK THE DISCUSSION OF GET VERY

01:05:58.220 --> 01:06:01.257
ROBUST.

01:06:01.324 --> 01:06:01.557
SO.

01:06:01.624 --> 01:06:03.626
BUT I GUESS WE'RE NOT TRYING.

01:06:03.693 --> 01:06:05.995
TO SNEAK THAT IN HERE I TRAILER

01:06:06.062 --> 01:06:07.129
BILL THERE'S A LINK TO THE SOUL

01:06:07.196 --> 01:06:08.397
AND WHAT I'M SORRY GO AHEAD IF I

01:06:08.464 --> 01:06:09.231
MANAGING FOR THE PROVISION Là

01:06:09.298 --> 01:06:09.899
AND IN THE BILL ITSELF AND I CAN

01:06:09.965 --> 01:06:10.700
PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

01:06:10.766 --> 01:06:11.300
AFTER THIS.

01:06:11.367 --> 01:06:11.934
BUT IT'S ALSO MY UNDERSTANDING

01:06:12.001 --> 01:06:12.535
THAT THOSE FUNDS WOULD NOT BE

01:06:12.601 --> 01:06:13.969
TAKEN AND THEN USE ON HOUSING

01:06:14.036 --> 01:06:15.071
THEY WOULD BE TAKING AND THEN

01:06:15.137 --> 01:06:19.175
REINVESTED IN --

01:06:19.241 --> 01:06:22.311
TRANSPORTATION --

01:12:32.147 --> 01:12:33.982
UNFAIRNESS.

01:12:34.049 --> 01:12:37.219
AND DESTROYS VASE IN GOVERNMENT.

01:12:37.286 --> 01:12:39.354
AND IT TO ME THE HYPOCRISY OF A

01:12:39.421 --> 01:12:41.623
VERY WEALTHY COUNTY FOR EXAMPLE.

01:12:41.690 --> 01:12:43.459

01:12:58.874 --> 01:12:59.908
TALKED ABOUT IN THE EARLIER

01:12:59.975 --> 01:13:02.911
ISSUE IS AGAIN HOW MUCH OF THIS

01:13:02.978 --> 01:13:04.646
FUNDING IS NOT TARGETED AT

01:13:04.713 --> 01:13:06.048
HOUSING PRODUCTION.

01:13:06.115 --> 01:13:10.352
OR HOMELESSNESS AND THE USE OF

01:13:10.419 --> 01:13:12.154
SO MUCH MONEY --

01:13:12.221 --> 01:13:13.922
FOR GENERAL PURPOSES.

01:13:13.989 --> 01:13:16.125

01:13:19.461 --> 01:13:20.896
APPRECIATE.

01:13:20.963 --> 01:13:22.030
EVERYTHING THAT THE GOVERNOR AND

01:13:22.097 --> 01:13:23.766
YOU AND OTHERS ARE DOING TO COME

01:13:23.832 --> 01:13:24.867

01:13:24.933 --> 01:13:28.737
THE BEST IDEAS BUT THE ACTION OF

EMERGENCY ISSUES --

01:13:35.511 --> 01:13:37.780
AND I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY

01:13:37.846 --> 01:13:39.248
WE KEEP PUTTING SO MUCH.

01:13:39.314 --> 01:13:41.750
OF WHAT CITIES AND COUNTIES TO

01:13:41.817 --> 01:13:43.786

01:18:39.948 --> 01:18:41.750
SEE MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING WE

01:18:41.817 --> 01:18:43.085
WILL SEE THOUSAND ALL INCOME

01:18:43.151 --> 01:18:44.419
LEVELS --

01:18:44.486 --> 01:18:45.921
BUT WITH THEIR SPECIFIC REGARD

01:18:45.987 --> 01:18:46.555
TO SOME OF THE POLLS IN THE BILL

01:18:46.621 --> 01:18:47.823
THE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION

01:18:47.889 --> 01:18:48.890
DOLLARS FOR PLANNING WE'VE YOU

01:18:48.957 --> 01:18:50.559
THAT IS IT IS VERY IMPORTANT I'M

01:18:50.625 --> 01:18:51.726
COMES ON THE HEELS OF SB TO

01:18:51.793 --> 01:18:52.561
FUNDING --

01:18:52.627 --> 01:18:53.829
WERE YOU SEE ABOUT A HUNDRED

01:18:53.895 --> 01:18:54.362
MILLION DOLLARS OR TWENTY

01:18:54.429 --> 01:18:55.363
MILLION DOLLARS COME OUT THE

01:18:55.430 --> 01:18:57.065
PLANET IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT

01:18:57.132 --> 01:18:58.133
AND I THINK IT'S EVEN MORE

01:18:58.200 --> 01:18:59.301
IMPORTANT AND THAT THERE WERE

01:18:59.367 --> 01:19:00.502
TWO BILLS IT PASSED THIS

01:19:00.569 --> 01:19:02.204
LEGISLATURE BUT A YEAR AGO.

01:19:02.270 --> 01:19:05.107
I'M SB A FIVE FORTY IN AB

01:19:05.173 --> 01:19:05.607
SEVENTY THREE THOSE BILL

01:19:05.674 --> 01:19:06.441
STREAMLINED THE HOUSING APPROVAL

01:19:06.508 --> 01:19:07.943
PROCESS YOU FRONT LOAD ALL THE

01:19:08.009 --> 01:19:09.644
ENVIRONMENT REVIEW YOU PROVIDE

01:19:09.711 --> 01:19:11.513
CERTAINTY TO DEVELOPERS YOU DO

01:19:11.580 --> 01:19:12.981
SEEK WERE AND ON THE BACK AND

01:19:13.048 --> 01:19:14.416
YOU HAVE BY RIGHT PROPOSALS WERE

01:19:14.483 --> 01:19:16.151
USE HAND THEM AN APPLICATOR THEY

01:19:16.218 --> 01:19:16.618
GIVE AN APPLICATION.

01:19:16.685 --> 01:19:18.320
WE HAVE A PERMIT AND THE

01:19:18.386 --> 01:19:19.921
BUILDING OCCURS NOBODY'S USE

01:19:19.988 --> 01:19:21.089
THOSE TWO BILLS THAT WENT

01:19:21.156 --> 01:19:21.823
THROUGH THIS LEGISLATURE BECAUSE

01:19:21.890 --> 01:19:22.991
RELEASE ANY FUNDING SO WE WOULD

01:19:23.058 --> 01:19:24.292
GREATLY APPRECIATE THE

01:19:24.359 --> 01:19:25.093
GOVERNOR'S DESIRE TO PUT MONEY

01:19:25.160 --> 01:19:26.495
IN THERE --

01:19:26.561 --> 01:19:27.062
FOR PLANNING WE'RE GONNA SEE

01:19:27.129 --> 01:19:28.964
UNITS BUILT BASED ON THOSE TWO

01:19:29.030 --> 01:19:30.832
BILLS IF FOLKS GET MONEY TO DO

01:19:30.899 --> 01:19:32.134
THE PLAN ASSOCIATED WITH IT --

01:19:32.200 --> 01:19:37.906
BUT WE DO SHARE SOME OF THE

01:19:37.973 --> 01:19:40.709
CONCERNS ARE ARE OF PLANNING

01:19:40.775 --> 01:19:41.877
THAT'S GOING TO BE REQUIRED IT'S

01:19:41.943 --> 01:19:42.878
A LITTLE UNCLEAR HOW WE'RE GONNA

01:19:42.944 --> 01:19:44.379
BE ABLE TO DO THAT IN THAT VERY

01:19:44.446 --> 01:19:45.914
SHORT TIME FRAME --

01:19:45.981 --> 01:19:46.882
SO WE LOOK FOR TO DO SOME

01:19:46.948 --> 01:19:48.083
CONVERSATIONS OF THE GOVERNOR'S

01:19:48.150 --> 01:19:49.417
OFFICE ON THAT BECAUSE IF WE GET

01:19:49.484 --> 01:19:51.353
THIS LARGER READ A NUMBER OF FOR

01:19:51.419 --> 01:19:52.754
YOU KNOW FOR A COUPLE YEARS.

01:19:52.821 --> 01:19:54.623
WE WE WON'T HAVE THE ZONING IN

01:19:54.689 --> 01:19:55.557
OUR COMMITTEES NECESSARILY TO

01:19:55.624 --> 01:19:56.992
ABSORB THAT SO WE'RE GONNA GO

01:19:57.058 --> 01:19:58.326
HAVE TO DO SEQUEL WE'RE GOING TO

01:19:58.393 --> 01:19:59.427
MENTOR GENERAL PLAN HOW ARE WE

01:19:59.494 --> 01:20:00.395
IN A BILL TO DO ALL THAT IN A

01:20:00.462 --> 01:20:01.563
VERY SHORT TIME FRAME.

01:20:01.630 --> 01:20:02.430
SO WE CERTAINLY HAVE --

01:20:02.497 --> 01:20:03.632
CONCERNS WITH THAT --

01:20:03.698 --> 01:20:04.833
BUT ALSO THERE'S THIS

01:20:04.900 --> 01:20:05.901
FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE AND GET BACK

01:20:05.967 --> 01:20:07.402
TO CENTER NIELSEN COMMENTS ABOUT

01:20:07.469 --> 01:20:08.737
THE THE POLICY PROPOSALS THAT

01:20:08.803 --> 01:20:10.105
ARE HERE AND HOW YOU KNOW BIG

01:20:10.172 --> 01:20:11.273
THEY ARE AND HOW IT'S MUCH MORE

01:20:11.339 --> 01:20:12.674
THAN A TRAILER BILL.

01:20:12.741 --> 01:20:13.642
ON THE LANGUAGE IT'S A THE

01:20:13.708 --> 01:20:15.110
TRAILER NOW RUN THE COGS ON

01:20:15.177 --> 01:20:16.244
THAT'S GOING TO FUNDAMENTALLY

01:20:16.311 --> 01:20:17.646
CHANGE THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN

01:20:17.712 --> 01:20:19.114
CITIES COUNTIES AND COGS.

01:20:19.181 --> 01:20:20.615
AND THAT'S A DISCUSSION I THINK

01:20:20.682 --> 01:20:21.349
THAT WE WOULD CERTAINLY WANT TO

01:20:21.416 --> 01:20:23.051
HAVE A BECAUSE IT'S BEEN VERY

01:20:23.118 --> 01:20:24.519
COLLABORATIVE RELATIONSHIP NOW --

01:20:24.586 --> 01:20:26.221
IN THE FOR GONNA PUT THE COGS IN

01:20:26.288 --> 01:20:27.189
A POSITION WHERE THEY HAVE.

01:20:27.255 --> 01:20:28.123
YOU KNOW IT CAN SECOND GUESS

01:20:28.190 --> 01:20:29.591
ACTIONS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL I

01:20:29.658 --> 01:20:30.492
THINK THAT'S GONNA COMPLICATE

01:20:30.559 --> 01:20:32.027
THAT RELATIONSHIP BECAUSE OUR

01:20:32.093 --> 01:20:33.261
CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS AND CAN I

01:20:33.328 --> 01:20:34.129
CAN SUPERVISORS.

01:20:34.196 --> 01:20:35.497
SAID ON THAT VERY CAUGHT SO WE

01:20:35.564 --> 01:20:36.498
CERTAINLY WOULD HAVE CONTINUED

01:20:36.565 --> 01:20:37.966
CONVERSATIONS AROUND THAT AND

01:20:38.033 --> 01:20:40.202
THEN FINALLY THE LINKAGE BETWEEN

01:20:40.268 --> 01:20:42.571
HOUSING PRODUCTION OR HOUSING

01:20:42.637 --> 01:20:43.271
PLANNING AND ONE DOLLARS.

01:20:43.338 --> 01:20:44.339
AND WE DO SHARE THE CONCERNS

01:20:44.406 --> 01:20:49.344
THAT THE KIANA MENTIONED ---WE FEEL THAT IT WOULD BETRAY THE

01:20:49.411 --> 01:20:50.779
THE VOTERS AND GOVERNOR

01:20:50.845 --> 01:20:53.882
COMMITTED WERE THE LEGISLATURE

01:20:53.949 --> 01:20:55.116
OF BECAUSE WE NEED MORE HOUSING

01:20:55.183 --> 01:20:57.285
SUPPLY AND THERE'S A WAY TO DO

01:20:57.352 --> 01:20:58.620
IT -- AND WE

01:20:58.687 --> 01:20:59.187
WANT TO TAKE PART IN THAT SO

01:20:59.254 --> 01:21:01.790
THANK YOU.

01:21:01.856 --> 01:21:02.691
CHRISLEY ON BEHALF OF THE

01:21:02.757 --> 01:21:04.226
CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF

01:21:04.292 --> 01:21:05.860
COUNTIES I'M SURE A LOT OF THE

01:21:05.927 --> 01:21:07.495
CONCERNS MENTIONED BY PRIOR

01:21:07.562 --> 01:21:09.497
SPEAKERS BUT DID ONE ADULT A BIT

01:21:09.564 --> 01:21:11.833
A CONTEXT THERE'S A THIRD OF THE

01:21:11.900 --> 01:21:13.735
COUNTY STATEWIDE ARE UPDATING

01:21:13.802 --> 01:21:15.136
THEIR HOUSING ELEMENTS DO EITHER

01:21:15.203 --> 01:21:16.304
THIS YEAR.

01:21:16.371 --> 01:21:17.839
OR IN TWENTY TWENTY SO I THINK

01:21:17.906 --> 01:21:19.574
WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT HOW THAT

01:21:19.641 --> 01:21:20.675
PROCESS WHICH IS KIND OF THE

01:21:20.742 --> 01:21:23.044
ONGOING PLANNING PROCESS.

01:21:23.111 --> 01:21:24.813
WHICH CONTINUES INTERACTS WITH

01:21:24.879 --> 01:21:26.481
THIS NEW SHORT TERM PLANNING

01:21:26.548 --> 01:21:28.083
PROCESS OF FOLKS WILL BE HAVING

01:21:28.149 --> 01:21:29.918
HIGHER SIX CYCLE NUMBERS VERSES

01:21:29.985 --> 01:21:31.419
EVERYONE ELSE WILL HAVE

01:21:31.486 --> 01:21:32.520
DIFFERENT SORT OF FIFTH CYCLE

01:21:32.587 --> 01:21:34.789
NUMBERS THAT THIS NEW PROCESS.

01:21:34.856 --> 01:21:36.091
OUTLINED IN THE TRAILER BILL IS

01:21:36.157 --> 01:21:37.993
BASED UPON SO FOR THOSE MOSTLY

01:21:38.059 --> 01:21:39.661
RURAL COUNTIES I THINK THAT'S AN

01:21:39.728 --> 01:21:41.196
IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION.

01:21:41.263 --> 01:21:43.198
I'M WE ALSO ARE VERY SUPPORTIVE

01:21:43.265 --> 01:21:44.432
OF PLANNING FUNDING --

01:21:44.499 --> 01:21:46.735
FOLKS ARE VERY EAGER TO GET

01:21:46.801 --> 01:21:48.436
THEIR APPLICATIONS IN FOR SB TO

01:21:48.503 --> 01:21:49.671
PLANNING GRANTS WHICH ARE JUST

01:21:49.738 --> 01:21:51.873
ABOUT TO COME ONLINE NEXT MONTH

01:21:51.940 --> 01:21:53.408
SO MORE FUNDING --

01:21:53.475 --> 01:21:54.509
FOR THOSE IMPORTANT ACTIVITIES

01:21:54.576 --> 01:21:55.977
IS OBVIOUSLY HELPFUL FOR

01:21:56.044 --> 01:21:57.145
EVERYONE --

01:21:57.212 --> 01:21:58.813
ON THE SIDE OF THE FIVE HUNDRED

01:21:58.880 --> 01:22:00.248
MILLION DOLLARS I THINK IN

01:22:00.315 --> 01:22:02.050
COUNTY WORLD A LOT OF WHAT WE

01:22:02.117 --> 01:22:03.218
REALLY NEED.

01:22:03.285 --> 01:22:04.953
AFTER WE DO THAT PLANNING IS

01:22:05.020 --> 01:22:07.155
IMPLEMENTATION FUNDING SO DO WE

01:22:07.222 --> 01:22:09.357
NEED TO UPGRADE A SEWER PLANT OR

01:22:09.424 --> 01:22:11.192
BUILD A SEWER PLANT SO WE CAN

01:22:11.259 --> 01:22:12.360
HAVE DENSER HOUSING IN

01:22:12.427 --> 01:22:13.728
UNINCORPORATED NEIGHBORHOOD.

01:22:13.795 --> 01:22:15.497
DO WE NEED TO OFFSET SOME OF THE

01:22:15.563 --> 01:22:16.731
OTHER COST SO THAT IT

01:22:16.798 --> 01:22:18.133
DEVELOPMENT THAT WOULDN'T BE

01:22:18.199 --> 01:22:20.302
PROFITABLE MIGHT ACTUALLY BECOME

01:22:20.368 --> 01:22:21.736
PROFITABLE WITH THAT INVESTMENT

01:22:21.803 --> 01:22:23.204
AND SO I THINK THE FOCUS ON

01:22:23.271 --> 01:22:24.739
PLANNING IS GOOD.

01:22:24.806 --> 01:22:27.409
BUT IN THE END OF CORPORATE

01:22:27.475 --> 01:22:30.612
AREAS ESPECIALLY IN SURE --

01:22:30.679 --> 01:22:32.847
IS ALSO NECESSARY --

01:22:32.914 --> 01:22:34.516
WE LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING THAT

01:22:34.582 --> 01:22:36.318
BROADER CONVERSATION ABOUT

01:22:36.384 --> 01:22:37.819
UPDATING THE LONG TERM

01:22:37.886 --> 01:22:39.120
PRODUCTION GOALS.

01:22:39.187 --> 01:22:40.789
WE DO SHARE THE RETICENCE ABOUT

01:22:40.855 --> 01:22:42.257
LINKING TRANSPORTATION FUNDING

01:22:42.324 --> 01:22:44.159
WITH HOUSING FACTORS THAT ARE

01:22:44.225 --> 01:22:45.593
BEYOND LOCAL GOVERNMENT CONTROL

01:22:45.660 --> 01:22:47.629
AND APPRECIATE THE PIVOT TOWARDS

01:22:47.696 --> 01:22:49.197
PLANNING AND ZONING RATHER THAN

01:22:49.264 --> 01:22:50.865
PRODUCTION BUT AGAIN WE WANT TO

01:22:50.932 --> 01:22:53.735
BE AT THE TABLE FOR THAT AND

01:22:53.802 --> 01:22:54.369
LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH ALL

01:22:54.436 --> 01:22:55.270
OF YOU.

01:22:55.337 --> 01:22:56.538
I I APPRECIATE THE POINT YOU

01:22:56.604 --> 01:22:58.073
MADE ABOUT.

01:22:58.139 --> 01:22:59.240
SO I APPRECIATE THE POINT YOU

01:22:59.307 --> 01:23:02.143
MADE ABOUT OF YOU KNOW

01:23:02.210 --> 01:23:04.412
IMPLEMENTATION MONEY SO WITH THE

01:23:04.479 --> 01:23:05.180
STORE.

01:23:05.246 --> 01:23:08.450
I THINK ANY KIND OF CONNECTION --

01:23:08.516 --> 01:23:10.652
IS DIFFERENT FROM JUST GENERAL

01:23:10.719 --> 01:23:13.288
PURPOSES IF THERE'S A REAL NEXUS

01:23:13.355 --> 01:23:14.956
A REAL CONNECTION SO LIKE YOU

01:23:15.023 --> 01:23:16.424
SAID HOUSING.

01:23:16.491 --> 01:23:17.592
SO WE NEED.

01:23:17.659 --> 01:23:19.127
TO MODERNIZE OR RENOVATE OUR

01:23:19.194 --> 01:23:20.995
SEWAGE SYSTEM THAT MAKES A LOT

01:23:21.062 --> 01:23:24.032
OF SENSE TO ME BUT JUST TO USE

01:23:24.099 --> 01:23:25.333
IT.

01:23:25.400 --> 01:23:26.267
FOR BROADLY SOMETHING ELSE I

01:23:26.334 --> 01:23:28.136
SWEAR I HAVE A PROBLEM BUT THANK

01:23:28.203 --> 01:23:31.840
YOU VERY MUCH.

01:23:31.906 --> 01:23:33.274
GOOD AFTERNOON THREE ZERO COUNTY

01:23:33.341 --> 01:23:35.443
REPRESENTS OF CALIFORNIA ALSO

01:23:35.510 --> 01:23:37.212
ONE ECHO THE COMMENTS OF THE

01:23:37.278 --> 01:23:39.147
PREVIOUS SPEAKERS --

01:23:39.214 --> 01:23:40.749
AND POINT OUT THAT --

01:23:40.815 --> 01:23:42.350
IN THE WITH THE LA --

01:23:42.417 --> 01:23:47.355
WE AGREE THAT REALLY THE EFFORT --

01:23:47.422 --> 01:23:49.157
TO FIND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND

01:23:49.224 --> 01:23:51.059
HELPING WITH PLANNING BUT WE WE

01:23:51.126 --> 01:23:52.761
THINK THAT OUR TIME WHEN IN

01:23:52.827 --> 01:23:53.995
MONEY AND EFFORTS OF PARTY

01:23:54.062 --> 01:23:56.765
BETTER SPENT AT LOOKING AT THE

01:23:56.831 --> 01:23:58.466
LONG TERM GOALS AND RINA --

01:23:58.533 --> 01:24:00.201
THIS PROPOSAL ITSELF

01:24:00.268 --> 01:24:02.470
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT RINA IS FLAWED

01:24:02.537 --> 01:24:04.038
AND THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT THAT

01:24:04.105 --> 01:24:06.274
AND SO. TO BASS SHORT TERM

01:24:06.341 --> 01:24:08.276
PLANNING GOALS ON SOMETHING THAT

01:24:08.343 --> 01:24:10.211
WE KNOW IS FUNDAMENTALLY FLAWED

01:24:10.278 --> 01:24:12.714
AND WE NEED TO REVAMP SEEMS LIKE --

01:24:12.781 --> 01:24:14.616
SETTING UP LOCALS --

01:24:14.682 --> 01:24:15.850
FOR FOR FAILURE IN STATE WHY

01:24:15.917 --> 01:24:18.019
PRODUCTION OF HOUSING --

01:24:18.086 --> 01:24:19.187
FOR FAILURE --

01:24:19.254 --> 01:24:20.822
ADDITIONALLY OBVIOUSLY WE WOULD

01:24:20.889 --> 01:24:22.290
BE VERY OPPOSED TO ANY LINKAGE

01:24:22.357 --> 01:24:24.526
WITH THAT TRANSPORTATION FUNDING

01:24:24.592 --> 01:24:27.362
ESPECIALLY RURAL AREAS WHERE --

01:24:27.429 --> 01:24:28.463
OUR ROADS ARE IN.

01:24:28.530 --> 01:24:29.831
SERIOUS DISREPAIR AND SOME OF

01:31:10.531 --> 01:31:12.733
STATE THERE FOR A LITTLE MORE --

01:31:12.800 --> 01:31:14.802
ENFORCEMENT OR REVIEW AUTHORITY

01:31:14.869 --> 01:31:16.604
OVER -- THE

01:31:16.671 --> 01:31:17.972
REGIONAL GOVERNMENTS --

01:31:18.039 --> 01:31:19.907
ALLOCATION OF RENO AS WELL AS

01:31:19.974 --> 01:31:20.741
BILLS AND SOME ADDITIONAL

01:31:20.808 --> 01:31:22.210
METHODOLOGY THESE TO BE TAKEN

01:31:22.276 --> 01:31:23.444
INTO ACCOUNT WHEN THOSE THINGS

01:31:23.511 --> 01:31:27.849
WHEN WHEN THE ACTUAL.

01:31:27.915 --> 01:31:29.183
RINA NUMBERS ARE DEVELOP SO.

01:31:29.250 --> 01:31:29.917
I THINK PEOPLE MAY KNOW THIS BUT

01:31:29.984 --> 01:31:30.484
LIKE THE RENO ACTUAL READING

01:31:30.551 --> 01:31:31.352
NUMBERS WE GIVE THEM TO THE

01:31:31.419 --> 01:31:32.053
LARGE REGION THERE THEN

01:31:32.119 --> 01:31:33.154
DISPERSED AT THE LOCAL

01:31:33.221 --> 01:31:34.288
GOVERNMENT LEVEL.

01:31:34.355 --> 01:31:36.357
AND SO THESE BILLS RESPONDED TO

01:31:36.424 --> 01:31:37.124
I THINK --

01:31:37.191 --> 01:31:39.393
FROM CRITICISM AROUND HOUSE SOME

01:31:39.460 --> 01:31:41.062
OF THE PROPHECIES HAD WORKED.

01:31:41.128 --> 01:31:42.830
US IN EQUITY AND HOW THIS

01:31:42.897 --> 01:31:43.965
DISTRIBUTION SAID.

01:31:44.031 --> 01:31:44.565
AS OF NOW --

01:31:44.632 --> 01:31:46.133
AT THE REGIONAL GOVERNMENT LEVEL

01:31:46.200 --> 01:31:46.934
THEY WILL --

01:31:47.001 --> 01:31:47.501
HAVE TO KIND OF DEFEND THOSE

01:31:47.568 --> 01:31:50.905
NUMBER METHODOLOGY WE NOW GET

01:31:50.972 --> 01:31:52.506
THE ABILITY TO REVIEW THAT

01:31:52.573 --> 01:31:53.107
METHODOLOGY MAKE SURE IT IS

01:31:53.174 --> 01:31:53.975
SOUND.

01:31:54.041 --> 01:31:55.276
SO THE IDEA HERE IS WE SHOULD --

01:31:55.343 --> 01:31:56.911
REDCE THOSE INEQUITIES THAT

01:31:56.978 --> 01:31:57.945
OCCURRED --

01:31:58.012 --> 01:31:59.080
THROUGH THAT GREATER

01:31:59.146 --> 01:32:01.582
TRANSPARENCY SO THERE IS --

01:32:01.649 --> 01:32:03.150
SOME ADDITIONAL WORK LOVE YA WE

01:32:03.217 --> 01:32:04.852

NEED TO REVIEW THAT THOSE AND

01:32:06.654 --> 01:32:07.622
AND DEVELOP THOSE KIND OF

01:32:07.688 --> 01:32:09.156
METHODOLOGY SYSTEM THROUGHOUT

01:32:09.223 --> 01:32:10.324

PROGRAMS.

01:34:15.316 --> 01:34:15.783
SO THERE'S NO PROGRAMMATIC

01:34:15.850 --> 01:34:19.253
CHANGES.

01:34:19.320 --> 01:34:20.421
UNDER THIS MODEL OF LA --

01:34:20.488 --> 01:34:20.921

01:34:20.988 --> 01:34:21.822

TIES THE NEED OF THE LOWEST

01:34:31.365 --> 01:34:32.233
INCOME INDIVIDUALS IN THE

CITIZENS OF THIS PUSHES THE

01:34:33.734 --> 01:34:35.403

A GIVEN THE UNMET NEEDS THAT

01:34:39.907 --> 01:34:41.942
REMAINS FOR THE LOWEST INCOME WE

01:34:42.009 --> 01:34:43.010
THINK THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD

01:34:43.077 --> 01:34:45.212
PRIORITIZE --

01:34:45.279 --> 01:34:46.347

01:34:46.414 --> 01:34:49.083
YEAH.

01:34:49.150 --> 01:34:51.185
NO THIS JUST ILLUSTRATES A NEED

01:34:51.252 --> 01:34:52.820
THAT THIS IS.

01:34:52.887 --> 01:34:55.556
SORT OF SELF REFLECTION OF FOR A

01:34:55.623 --> 01:34:57.892
A CHART TO EXPLAIN.

01:34:57.958 --> 01:35:00.194
WHAT WHAT WE'RE DOING FOR THE

01:35:00.261 --> 01:35:01.729
LOWEST INCOME?

01:35:01.796 --> 01:35:02.963

01:35:03.030 --> 01:35:04.565
HOMELESSNESS WHAT WE'RE DOING

01:35:04.632 --> 01:35:04.899
FOR MODERATE.

01:35:04.965 --> 01:35:07.034
LEVELS OF THE VARIOUS PROGRAMS

01:35:07.101 --> 01:35:08.602
THAT EXIST THIS IS YOU DON'T

01:35:08.669 --> 01:35:10.638
NEED TO RESPOND TO THIS IT'S

01:35:10.704 --> 01:35:14.475
JUST SOMETHING THAT --

01:35:14.542 --> 01:35:15.009
ALL.

01:35:15.076 --> 01:35:15.843
PERHAPS IF YOU'VE GOT SOMETHING

01:35:15.910 --> 01:35:17.978
LIKE THAT TO EXPLAIN ALL THAT

01:35:18.045 --> 01:35:19.547
WOULD BE WONDERFUL.

01:35:19.613 --> 01:35:21.916
I THINK THAT'S A GREAT IDEA A

01:35:21.982 --> 01:35:22.116
GROUP.

01:35:22.183 --> 01:35:24.018
CAN JUST GET.

01:35:24.085 --> 01:35:26.120
GET STUCK IN A LOT OF SQUARES

01:35:26.187 --> 01:35:28.489
WITH MONIES AND THEN NOT KNOW

01:35:28.556 --> 01:35:32.393
EXACTLY WHAT IT ADDS UP.

01:35:32.460 --> 01:35:33.627
TO DEPARTMENT FINANCE I DON'T

01:35:33.694 --> 01:35:34.495
KNOW THE WE HAVE SOMETHING LIKE

01:35:34.562 --> 01:35:36.030
THAT PREPARED BUT IF WE DO A

01:35:36.097 --> 01:35:38.199
CHECK AND I'LL HAVE TO SEND THAT

01:35:38.265 --> 01:35:40.801
OVER TO STAFF.

01:35:40.868 --> 01:35:42.169
I REMEMBER ONCE --

01:35:42.236 --> 01:35:43.904
AND THE UNITED WAY BOARD TALKING

01:35:43.971 --> 01:35:46.474
ABOUT HOUSING NEEDS AND AND LA

01:35:46.540 --> 01:35:47.908
COUNTY.

01:35:47.975 --> 01:35:52.113
AND IF THERE WAS INFORMATION WE

01:35:52.179 --> 01:35:53.614
GOT INFORMATION ABOUT.

01:35:53.681 --> 01:35:54.882
THAT PRODUCTION OF HOUSING

01:35:54.949 --> 01:35:56.317
WASN'T.

01:35:56.383 --> 01:35:58.018
WASN'T AIMED AT MODERATE.

01:35:58.085 --> 01:36:00.020
INCOME LEVELS --

01:36:00.087 --> 01:36:01.689
AND THERE WAS ACTUALLY I WAS

01:36:01.755 --> 01:36:03.824
MORE STAGNATED THAN EVEN THE

01:36:03.891 --> 01:36:05.493
PRODUCTION OF LOW INCOME THE

01:36:05.559 --> 01:36:06.594
PROBLEM IS THAT THERE'S A

01:36:06.660 --> 01:36:08.062
GREATER NEED.

01:36:08.129 --> 01:36:10.397
AT THE LOW INCOME LEVEL BUT I

01:36:10.464 --> 01:36:11.866
REMEMBER THAT WAS THAT WAS A BIT

01:36:11.932 --> 01:36:14.135
OF A SURPRISE TO ME WHAT I I

01:36:14.201 --> 01:36:15.736
DON'T UNDERSTAND IS.

01:36:15.803 --> 01:36:17.104
REALLY WHAT'S THAT NEED AND SO

01:36:17.171 --> 01:36:22.476
MAYBE I WHY WOULD BE FOCUSED ON

01:36:22.543 --> 01:36:23.944
MODERATE INCOME.

01:36:24.011 --> 01:36:25.513
I I KNOW GENERALLY BUT NOT

01:36:25.579 --> 01:36:28.149
SPECIFICALLY WHY WOULD WE MAKE

01:36:28.215 --> 01:36:31.919
THAT A PRIORITY.

01:36:31.986 --> 01:36:33.621
SO IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING NOW IT'S

01:36:33.687 --> 01:36:38.926
MORE BECAUSE YEAH EVEN EVEN

01:36:38.993 --> 01:36:39.493
THOUGH WE'RE NOT THE

01:36:39.560 --> 01:36:41.228
ADMINISTERING ENTITY OF THIS

01:36:41.295 --> 01:36:43.464

01:36:48.536 --> 01:36:49.069
ON THE FROM A SOURCE BILL SO

01:36:49.136 --> 01:36:51.372
THAT ALLOCATED 15% TO ADDRESS

01:36:51.438 --> 01:36:52.606
KIND OF MIDDLE INCOME NEEDS THIS

01:36:52.673 --> 01:36:54.108
WOULD NOT GET AUGMENTATION FOR

01:36:54.175 --> 01:36:58.646
KIND OF THAT APPROACH --

01:36:58.712 --> 01:36:59.780
EM.

01:36:59.847 --> 01:37:00.781
THIS VERY HIGH LEVEL MOST

01:37:00.848 --> 01:37:01.715
PROGRAMS BOTH FEDERAL AND STATE

THROUGHOUT OUR STATE GIVEN HIGH

THEY CANNOT LIVE WHERE THEY WORK

01:37:15.196 --> 01:37:17.965
THAT IS PART OF THE ARGUMENT

01:37:18.032 --> 01:37:19.200
BEHIND A CERTAINLY --

01:37:19.266 --> 01:37:20.534
IT IS COMPLEMENTARY TO SOME OF

01:37:20.601 --> 01:37:21.936
THE OTHER PROGRAMS THAT

01:37:22.002 --> 01:37:25.206

SE ON THE VOTERS IS JUST A

01:42:28.408 --> 01:42:29.443

THE EXACT SAME THING.

01:42:32.579 --> 01:42:33.680
THAT WOULD BE A VIOLATION THE

01:42:33.747 --> 01:42:36.283

ENTITIES SUCH AS JOINT POWERS

01:42:39.453 --> 01:42:42.222
AGENCIES DO NOT HAVE TO ACTUALLY

GET VOTER APPROVAL FOR DEBT

01:42:43.423 --> 01:42:44.258
ISSUANCES.

01:42:44.324 --> 01:42:46.727

OKAY BUT THESE ARE STATE CREATED

01:42:48.962 --> 01:42:50.297
I'M THESE ARE CREATED BY LOCAL

01:42:50.364 --> 01:42:51.832
ENTITIES CITIES AND COUNTIES ARE

01:42:51.899 --> 01:42:53.467
AUTHORIZED TO CREATE THEM.

01:42:53.534 --> 01:42:54.268
AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS IS A

01:42:54.334 --> 01:42:57.471
PARTNER THE OTHER LOCAL AGENCIES --

01:42:57.538 --> 01:42:58.705

TAX TO THE FINANCING.

01:43:04.711 --> 01:43:05.846
SO LET'S COUNCILS OKAY WITH THIS

01:43:05.913 --> 01:43:07.014
NOW -- BOWL

01:43:07.080 --> 01:43:08.282
I THINK LEAD COUNSEL IN

ADMINISTRATION HAVE A

01:43:09.016 --> 01:43:09.750

01:43:51.224 --> 01:43:51.825
AND SO THEY'RE JUST FLAGGING

01:43:51.892 --> 01:43:55.495
THAT THERE'S A POTENTIAL FOR

01:43:55.562 --> 01:43:57.264

THOUGHT YOUR TYPE OF THE CALHOUN

01:50:44.938 --> 01:50:46.673
PROGRAM WHICH I REALIZE NOW IS

01:50:46.740 --> 01:50:52.679
PROBABLY. TO TO ITEMIZE BEFORE.

01:50:52.746 --> 01:50:53.980
I'M RIGHT OKAY LOCAL HOW THE

01:50:54.047 --> 01:50:55.582
JUST AND MY MY MISTAKE AT LOCAL

01:50:55.648 --> 01:50:56.016
HOUSING TRUST FUND.

01:50:56.082 --> 01:50:56.950
IS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT FIRST

01:50:57.017 --> 01:50:57.684
OF ALL --

01:50:57.751 --> 01:50:59.285
THE WAY THE IT IS THE IT IS

01:50:59.352 --> 01:50:59.953
GENERALLY A CITY OR COUNTY THAT

01:51:00.020 --> 01:51:01.087
APPLIES ALTHOUGH IT CAN BE A

01:51:01.154 --> 01:51:03.256
NONPROFIT AS WELL THAT OFTEN IS

01:51:03.323 --> 01:51:04.024
SORT OF AN OFFSHOOT OR CITY

01:51:04.090 --> 01:51:06.793
COUNTY BUT THEY THEY ARE.

01:51:06.860 --> 01:51:09.596
THEY HAVE AN IDENTIFY REVENUE

01:51:09.662 --> 01:51:10.997
SOURCE FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING

01:51:11.064 --> 01:51:12.232
AND WE ARE SORT OF MATCHING THAT

01:51:12.298 --> 01:51:14.334
RIGHT SO HERE'S THE ELIGIBILITY

01:51:14.401 --> 01:51:16.503
IS NOT JUST TO BE A CITY CAN OR

01:51:16.569 --> 01:51:18.271
NONPROFIT BUT IT IS ONE THAT HAS.

01:51:18.338 --> 01:51:19.806

HAVE A COMMERCIAL LINKAGE FEE

01:51:25.278 --> 01:51:27.013
WHEN.

01:51:27.080 --> 01:51:28.648
WHEN COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS ARE

01:51:28.715 --> 01:51:30.917

DEVELOPER PAYS A CERTAIN AMOUNT?

01:51:32.585 --> 01:51:33.787

BUILDING SO THAT'S A DEDICATED

01:51:37.490 --> 01:51:38.725
REVENUE SOURCE AND WE'RE THIS

01:51:38.792 --> 01:51:40.093
PROGRAM THE IDEA OF IT IS TO

01:51:40.160 --> 01:51:41.127
ENCOURAGE.

01:51:41.194 --> 01:51:42.429

01:51:46.466 --> 01:51:47.967
THEY ARE NON PROFITS OF LIKE A

01:51:48.034 --> 01:51:50.336
COUNTY LEVEL BUT THAT'S ACTUALLY

01:51:50.403 --> 01:51:52.705
FAIRLY UNUSUAL --

01:51:52.772 --> 01:51:53.907
AND THEN AGAIN THEY WOULD THEN

01:51:53.973 --> 01:51:55.508
ADMINISTER THE MONEY AND THAT

01:51:55.575 --> 01:51:56.776
MONEY CAN GO FOR HOMEOWNERSHIP

01:51:56.843 --> 01:51:58.578
OR RENTAL HOUSING SO UNLIKE CAL

01:51:58.645 --> 01:52:00.013

AS A RESULT OF THIS [inaudible]

02:00:05.131 --> 02:00:06.666
SOME.

02:00:06.732 --> 02:00:08.234
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN SO IN MY

02:00:08.301 --> 02:00:11.304
EXPERIENCE WITH REGARDS TO THE

02:00:11.370 --> 02:00:12.872

02:00:20.580 --> 02:00:22.148
POSITIONS.

02:00:22.214 --> 02:00:23.616
SO IN MY EXPERIENCE --

02:00:23.683 --> 02:00:24.917
WHEN YOU DO THE DEEPER DIVES

02:00:24.984 --> 02:00:26.385
INTO THE BUSINESS PROCESS

02:00:26.452 --> 02:00:27.587
ANALYSIS --

02:00:27.653 --> 02:00:29.722
YOU'RE ABLE TO IDENTIFY A LOT OF

02:00:29.789 --> 02:00:31.490
INEFFICIENCIES IN A PROCESS A

02:00:31.557 --> 02:00:32.425
LOT OF WASTE --

02:00:32.491 --> 02:00:33.759
SOME OF THE TYPICAL FORMS OF

02:00:33.826 --> 02:00:35.895
WAYS THAT WE SEE OUR EXTENSIVE

02:00:35.962 --> 02:00:38.130
REVIEW AND APPROVAL PROCESSES --

02:00:38.197 --> 02:00:39.732
INEFFECTIVE FILL OUT FORMS THAT

02:00:39.799 --> 02:00:41.033
HAVE A LOT OF DEFECTS ON THE

02:00:41.100 --> 02:00:42.668
FRONT END BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T

02:00:42.735 --> 02:00:44.136
BEEN ANALYZED FOR MANY YEARS AS

02:00:44.203 --> 02:00:47.006
FAR AS WHETHER OR NOT WE SHOULD --

02:00:47.073 --> 02:00:50.776
STAFF OR ACTUALLY SO OUT --

02:00:50.843 --> 02:00:52.278

INCREMENTAL IMPROVEMENTS AND

02:00:55.314 --> 02:00:56.949
CHANGES TO THOSE PROCESSES AND

02:00:57.016 --> 02:00:58.384
WHAT IT DOES IS IT --

02:00:58.451 --> 02:01:00.219
INCREASES STAFF TIME AND BE ABLE

02:01:00.286 --> 02:01:01.554
BEING ABLE TO WORK ON THE HIGHER

02:01:01.621 --> 02:01:03.589
PRIORITY WORK AND THAT'S WHAT WE

02:01:03.656 --> 02:01:05.191
MEAN BY IDENTIFYING THE FISH --

02:01:05.257 --> 02:01:06.592
INEFFICIENCIES --

02:01:06.659 --> 02:01:07.860
TYPICALLY WHAT WE DO WHEN WE

02:01:07.927 --> 02:01:09.929
STARTUP PROJECT AS WE WE ASK

02:01:09.996 --> 02:01:11.697

02:01:23.242 --> 02:01:24.410
PROCESSES AND REALIZE THE

02:01:24.477 --> 02:01:25.411
EFFICIENCIES.

02:01:25.478 --> 02:01:28.648
WE WERE ABLE TO REALLOCATE AND

02:01:28.714 --> 02:01:29.248
SHIFT THEM TO THAT PARTICULAR

02:01:29.315 --> 02:01:30.016
WORK.

02:01:30.082 --> 02:01:31.250
DOES THAT PROCESS --

THERE'S NO NEED?

02:01:51.570 --> 02:01:52.805
