Welcome to a joint select committee hearing a plastic pollution and its effect on the California coast my name is mark stone on the chair of select committee on coastal protection and access. To California's natural resources I am joined today by other something members. Assembly member Kevin McCarty who. Select committee on it what. I was waste reduction is waste reduction. This not committee on coastal protection we've done a number of things around threats to the cause of our men including classic ocean pollution things and so. As we can't really talk about plastic and pollution without. The waste management waste reduction issue and that's why Mister McCarty I decided it would be a good idea to do a joint hearing on that. We also have seventy members off Kalra and were Friedman who are joining us here today. So often times when we go out to the district with select committees are not. Always well attended by a legislator have some significant legislators and will give everyone a chance. To speak a little bit of logistics there some parking information on the table by the doors if you have not registered your vehicle using that parking information. You might end up with that ticket. So feel free to grab one of those and make sure that you are. Officially logged into the system so that you don't get a ticket restrooms are out to the left you'll notice we close the blinds behind this to the bill try to pay some attention to us and not to the incredible scene had is actually out though. Out the windows and out the door but feel free. To get up and move around. As necessary. So I just wanted to make sure that we frame this as talking about pollution in the marine environment and how we are responsible for waste reduction and from my standpoint. Waste reduction is really not only about the back and cleaning up what's there but trying to be responsible how we understand products product manufacturing. The whole retail chain so that every product especially with plastic plastic packaging war parts that are single use or short duration use. We have a way of collecting and managing that responsibly. If we doubt what we see often is that that ends up. In the creeks rivers and watersheds and ultimately out into the ocean and even though ram the Monterey Bay very proud that we have so many people willing to go out and do coastal cleanup days. Add we have been working with state parks. Because we have a lot of beach side state parks and the county cities to put their resources available to clean up the beach is it should not is an issue that should not always fall on the volunteers for the local jurisdictions to be responsible to clean up. Think we need a broader. Policies and and more comprehensive solutions where everyone is engaged in taking some responsibility for helping address the plastic waste problem. And so this is where we're going to explore a number of issues around the coastline look at some next steps and then take some public comment. So many turn the microphone over to coach chair this Mister McCarty and then ask the other so members to weigh in before we get to the past. Good morning thank you for all coming out. Today and then thank you -- Someone member stone for walk beautiful district and I don't think you could have picked a better location. No you don't trust has which is why you close the blinds behind this -- And you know you got you represent the coast here but it's important that we all on the coast. Forty million Californians whether or not you. Live in a coastal community as well. And that we want to make sure we preserve the coast for future generations but also in districts like mine we have. Rivers and streams and creeks and other plastic issues impact those areas and of course the end up and in the day in the ocean as well so -- I serve on the natural resources committee -- With you and I and I also chair of the select committee on waste reduction and recycling so -- Plastics and its impact the environment and recycling waste reduction all kind of go hand in hand. And this hearing today is an important opportunity. For us understand -- The the dynamics of the issue see here in California as well as a potential remedies that -- That would be key looking at ten twenty nineteen and beyond and I certainly look forward. To our panelists and our public discussion here today and to get a look for to today's here thank you. Thank you misread. Thank you I want to first thank the chairs -- Chair McCarty ensure stone for holding this hearing and inviting. Your colleagues and the public to join us I represent for cities in Los Angeles Los Angeles county including part of the city of Los Angeles. So will my district does not touch the coastline certainly my city does. Anna's chair McCarty said we all have ownership of the coastlines in California. The justice last week I was horrified to see a story in the LA times about how we are literally eating salt by eating plastic. Because of the amount of micro of micro pollution that's entered the food stream through salt and other products. So this is something that's on the mind of of myself and certainly of my constituents. Think we're starting to understand the scope of the problem in terms of the public understanding. But all of us are struggling to find solutions. With some concrete actions that we can take over the next legislative session next couple of years to start really tackling this problem. Thank you score. Thank you. Chair stone Chen McCarty and and my colleague summer Friedman -- Oskol representing some it is a twenty seven over the hill in San Jose. And my echo the comments of my colleagues here and this would add that -- As high as often times in the case special last -- Of input in in recent years -- Ill California's not only that in terms of trying to see what we can do to prevent Harmon -- In our own jurisdiction but really it. I think we have a responsibility to wrestle world should ever weekend in partnering up with so many others around the world are trying to deal. With the issue of our oceans event plastics -- Of from continuing. To invade our oceans -- Sea level rise and on and on and on these are issues that affect California and and all California's matter where they live. But it's also a global issue and I think it's one more area where we need to lead -- And as global leaders and and I'm grateful to be able to serve. A with leaders like those that are at the table here with me and and certainly -- I'm interested in learning from the folks committee speaking today -- And and I really appreciate these kinds hearings because it gives us opportunity when we're in our off season or not in the legislative cycle to repair what comes next what we need to do. To continue to to lead on our state for its of thank you. Thank you ending it is significant to have some Inland legislators here and and I know we have all worked. Very closely on some significant environmental policy. But it is true the Californians feel an owner it is a good resource it's part of Californians identity. And as a formal. Former California coastal commissioner when things we did find across the coast or across the state. Was people valued the regulatory scheme to protect access protect the beauty protect the ability for people to feel that ownership and be able to go to the coast and so. As we talk about coastal issues. We really are expanding beyond what just. The coastal jurisdictions thank but it's very very much. Eighty issue for the entire Population California. Right so our first panel will be discussing effective on the coast line. And we have UCSC professor mark car and I want to thank you CSE for hosting us today this is an incredible facility and and a great resource. We also have Amy will from from the Monterey Bay aquarium and hollywire from the ocean protection council and I will note that the ocean protection council be be. Here tomorrow so dates a couple days of oceans issue. Alright so professor Kerr thank you -- Let me start. Chair stone by thinking the chairs as well as the committees for the opportunity to to engage in this discussion. Today. When it came to identifying with the panelists we're going to do -- I again picked the short straw I am the one who is going to describe the significance of the problem. And then all the people who follow me are going to describe how they're contributing to the solution -- So I want to start my frame. And really the core of the problem is the ever growing amount of plastic that is produced in the world. By demand of consumers and so this graph shows the amount in million tons of plastic that is being generated globally over time and I want to point out in this figure. That by the year two thousand we were producing about two hundred million times. By twenty ten ten years later we are up to three hundred million. In only five years later we're up at four hundred million tons per year -- So it's not just that there's so much it's the fact that we're producing in more and more at an ever growing rate. And so of course with all that production. It we end up with debris material that that gets discarded in various ways and I want to point out in this figure that. Those the major producers and they're and also the major sources of debris include Asian comp countries like China and us the United States of America. Next slide please. And so with all that waste the to being generated -- By these countries. Of the fader that material -- Varies between recycling and other -- Consequences. This graph shows that over time the proportion that's actually being recycled. Is growing right and so by twenty fifteen roughly 20% of the waste that's being generated. Is actually being recycled -- Another 25% or more gets incinerated. But which is probably spooky in its own right. But notice that roughly 60% of the the plastic that's being produced is getting discarded either in the landfills or other fates -- And I'm one of those fades is the leader in coastal areas and so this graph shows again those countries. That have the largest country of coastal letter of plastic debris in the world. And noticed that the United States is generating on the order of two hundred and seventy five thousand tons per year of discarded plastic. Waste on and this is. Constrained to fifty kilometers along the coast line so much at that production is being -- Is being a weight that -- To to discarded on the coast line -- And so the question is how does all this plastic get into the ocean the vast vast majority of it comes from the land. Roughly aid is 7280% of ocean plastic debris. Comes from the land. The other -- about half of that importantly comes from debris associated with fishing fishing lines fishing that this is a big source of plastic debris. And then other -- Ocean based sources as vessels. But importantly. It's the vast majority of it comes from land and to important conduits by which plastic debris gets to the ocean. Is either through major river systems as illustrated here with this graph this photo of the Los Angeles river -- That transports much of that cools the letter to the coast line -- The other this the smaller micro plastics are also did cards through waste water systems that that -- That are not treated -- Because of the size of the material next. So what are the consequences of all of these plastics that are -- Moved and transported into the ocean so there's five major sort of categories of ecological consequences. One particularly important consequences entanglement -- And this tends to occur especially for large marine mammals -- And see birds as illustrated in these photos -- Much of that entanglement is is material that's lots from fishing. Again naps and lines next slide -- But another major -- Consequence is that direct ingestion of plastics by a wide variety of species. And then one of the the two big problems with all that ingestion. Is that it can a clue the digestive track so that animals can no longer properly digest material passage through their bodies. And as a consequence they die out right. The other is that the material may collect in their gods. And it takes up space that would otherwise be filled with nutrient rich food material. And as a consequence it greatly reduces the growth rate of organisms which again alternate reduces their reproductive potential and increases their likelihood of of Diane Next slide -- Then there is the the problem of contamination that was mentioned earlier. In this is where the plastic materials -- Actually our talks and toxicants -- And contaminants for organisms and I start with that image there which is -- Shows a a survey of the country PC bees -- Impeached plastic pellets around the world. PC bees are are linked to reproductive disorders increased risk of disease altering hormone levels in an organism and ultimately contributing directly to death. And and noticed that the the concentrations globally tend to be well below a hundred PC bees -- Plastic -- Pallets per area but look at San Francisco and Los Angeles as two of the highest -- Areas of concentration of these P. P. C.. P. skews me PCB laden pallets that and that mostly and up on coastal beaches -- And importantly it's the contaminants that are in the plastics themselves but also realize that plastics in here other contaminants. And make those available -- When they're to organisms when they're ingested as well next slide please -- In an annex or a and an example of that specifically because much of this stuff ends up on beaches. Is that it gets and consumed by all the all organisms that live within the the sandy beach area -- Which in turn are the major pray for many of the shore birds along the coast so this is the primary means by which plastic contaminants. Ultimately end up in birds like the greater share water through those what are called truth thick -- Interactions the consumption of prey that are are on contaminated to start with. Next slide please. And then that leads to other indirect consequences. As this stuff accumulates on beaches like beach rack kelp does as well. We go through -- Great efforts to remove it and clean it from the beach but that process itself actually disrupts that ecosystem. I mentioned all the organisms that live in those sandy beaches and when we go through and constantly just wrapped and removed -- That that San we impact the communities of organisms that live in the sand which again are wet those shore birds and other species are dependent upon. And finally -- A really important -- Consequence of plastic is as what is referred to of actor a transport factor of invasive species and this is because that those plastics can move great distances. Clearly from one side of the Pacific as we've seen from -- Fukushima. And as those plastics move they get colonized by organisms they transport those organisms to new places. That naturally would not. Get to and as a consequence there a means of transporting invasive species which then can alter communities at the recipient -- Ecosystems. So these are the the five primary ways that these various contaminants are all terrain -- Population individual organisms populations communities and entire ecosystems. Through these different kinds of interactions. And I think that's it for me. Having been the Debbie Downer of the panel. Great thank you and I think what we'll do is have each. First on the panel presents and then open it up for questions from. Assembly member [inaudible] Great. Whether pulling up my slides my name's Amy wohl from I'm from the Monterey Bay aquarium I do California ocean policy work there at the aquarium or here. In the bay in the world. And one moment please. Air I am so I am here today to share with Monterey Bay aquarium has gotten involved to help reduce ocean plastic pollution and to understand more about the impact it's having on the health of the ocean as well as our fresh water wildlife and ecosystems. The problem of plastic pollution becomes more vivid every day as a growing body of research is revealing how ubiquitous plastic has become in nature. And points to help businesses usual approach means more and more plastic will enter the environment in years to come. On the positive side of this issue is solvable. And as attention on it grows so does innovation in the public and private sector to move us to new more sustainable directions. Many of you have likely seen images of plastic soups like this one an even more disturbing photos of marine animals. I won't show days today but images like these have captured the public attention and started a global movement to prevent plastic pollution [inaudible] Next slide. This issue. Has definitely captured the attention of our visitors based on a two thousand eighteen survey over half of our visitors view plastic pollution is the biggest threat to ocean health and see taking action on this issue is a key key way to help the ocean. There are also been statewide surveys of California voters on this issue that showed that a majority of them are concerned about the impacts of plastic pollution. On our beaches and waterways. In fact a majority vote voters here in California res rejected a ballot proposal to appeal California's first in the nation statewide plastic bag law. And we also saw the passage of AB eighteen eighty four straws on request. Next slide. Media outlets like National Geographic can the sciences story of plastic pollution front and center in the public eye. Grassroots an NGO led campaigns on the issue continue to proliferate and now there are signs that heightened awareness by the public many of whom are consumers of plastic is inspiring change from the local to global level. Next slide. And what impact does all this plastic pollution having on marine life. Next slide. Scientists report that there's been an increase in the number of incidences between plastic and marine animals either by entanglement or ingestion as we just heard from professor car. That sometimes leads to mortality otherwise known as death. Nearly seven hundred marines beaches have been impacted by plastic over half of all individual sea turtles have ingested plastic. And it's estimated that by. Twenty twenty five or twenty fifty excuse me 95% of all sea birds live in just a plastic. Plastic is also affected at least twenty six species of cetaceans including the pilot well found struggling to swim in a tie can now this past June. Any Cropsey animal autopsy showed that it had seventeen pounds of plastic and stomach that made it impossible for the well to ingest food. An important area of future researches help plastic impacts these animals at the population level. Both today and into the future as the volume of plastic pollution grows. Another attribute of most plastic that is problematic or next yep thank you. The another attribute of most plastic that is problematic for the environment is that it does not biodegrade under natural conditions. They can break down into smaller and smaller pieces particles less than five millimeters in size or referred to as Michael plastic. Other types of Michael plastic like micro national waste management devices and flow into the water waste and land. Recent studies demonstrate that were only beginning to scratch the surface of the prevalence of Michael plastic in the ocean and its impact. We know that it can spread throughout the water column. From service to see floor and that organisms as small as plankton can ingest Michael plastic before being eaten by fish and other animals higher up the food chain. We want to learn more about this bioaccumulation of fact especially considering the plastic can contain toxic chemicals that may be absorbed into the tissues of marine organisms. There's a lot we still have to learn about these processes and so far many in the scientific community. Said the plastic in seafood for example does not yet pose a significant risk to human health. The more plastic that enters the ocean food web though the greater the urgency for answering these types of important questions. So what is the solution to the growing passed a pollution problem if there's anything positive to say about such a broad and complex challenges that there are lots of actions. Each of us can take to close the gap between protect production of plastic and recovery of it. And stem the flow of plastic into our ocean. The two over arching solutions the solutions strategies that in for my work at the aquarium our first. We have to turn down the Tanpa we deal with the mass. This means we need to address source reduction at the same time is we would prove waste management especially in the countries that are quote leaking the most plastic into the ocean. Number two now is a great time to innovate ways we can move from a linear lifecycle for plastic. The one to one that keeps the plastic we need the most in use for as long as possible. On living away from unnecessary single use. Monterey Bay aquarium is leading a consortium of twenty two aquariums across the United States brought together to increase our collective impact on ocean conservation. The partnership is adopted plastic pollution as its primary goal and last year all members aquariums pledge to live immediately eliminate all plastic straws for my food service. And take away bags from our gift shops and significantly reduce or eliminate plastic beverage bottles by. Twenty twenty Monterey Bay aquarium has already phase that are single use bottles along with other single use plastic items in our front of the house food service operations. Were also working with their food and retail service provider to reduce single use plastic in our gift store. We know this is an easy and that's why we are champion of business and government working to make incremental change. In the right direction we hope the more committed we are to change the more new and innovative solutions will emerge to solve the problem of ocean plastic pollution for good. Thank you for the opportunity to speak with you today. Thank you. These. Good morning thank you for having me here today -- I'm all the wire and the marine pollution program manager at the California ocean protection council -- And as the finder coming up I just to provide you got to the brief background on who the agent protection council is -- What we are a state agency this sort of nested within the natural resources agency -- And we work to protect the ocean for current and future generations -- We working for me in ways we recommend and implement policy. Abby leading promote coordination among state agencies. Mistaken leverage funding for research and making with the best available science. The OPC has been working on plastic pollution since -- Two thousand seven and today I'll be talking about some of our more recent work on the issue -- Before I died into what we see is been doing I know we've heard a lot about ecological impact of plastic and I wanted to briefly mention the economic impact of plastic the California -- Into twenty fifteen California communities were spending more than four hundred twenty eight million per year to clean up and control letter -- And in addition to that a lot of the litter cleanups are done using volunteers which cost them their time -- In the volunteer service -- The California adopt a highway participants is estimated at eighteen million annually. Enjoy this cost the state a lot of money -- So how are we going about addressing this issue. A and I'm going to cover if you policy initiatives today and the first is a twenty eighteen notion that our strategy and then I'll take a few minutes to talk about the trash amendments and packaging reform. Other twenty eighteen session letter strategy outlines OPC priorities and stakeholder actions to address social lettering California over the next six years -- And I just one other plastic pollution of the multi faceted problems of the strategy include action that a really wide variety of skills and scopes -- Essentially because no one solution is really going to just be the silver bullet that's all all of this -- So we want to include a wide range of which and annex side please. Overall the strategy has prioritized source reduction as the most effective and least costly. Costly method to reduce plastic pollution. And we define this as practices that reduce the amount of materials entering the waste stream am including changes in the design manufacture or a purchase or use of materials. Next slide please. Organizations can engage in source reduction at multiple points in the product life cycle -- Including making changes in the design institutional purchasing -- And distribution of items that commonly become plastic pollution -- In addition to this when you're sort of decision points model -- Governments can also make broad changes to waste management that encourage source reduction on a large scale. And for example implementing policies that will produce or to responsible for the end of life management -- And disposal ideally recycling or reuse of their products next by please. As part of the initial letter strategy the OPC is developed as priorities to address social letter -- And today it I've we have three categories listed out here -- In today and really just going to focus on the first one of land based sources division letter. This means -- Product to be calmly find that's rappers that sort of thing -- The uppity has identified -- Number priority actions to address this and I can't go through all of them but a few of them include permitting changes and state purchasing and service contracts to get combination letter items -- Out of the dining facilities and state buildings -- Promoting comprehensive waste management approaches to prevent the production of combination letter items through cal recycles packaging reform efforts. On and supporting policies that reduce expanded polystyrene letter -- Such as a provision in single use food service where -- Or including inclusion of expanded polystyrene in college like of packaging reform efforts. Under to provide a little bit more background on this OPC included -- Expanded polystyrene began in our two two thousand eight letters prodigy. And we've included in the twenty eight to twenty eighteen document for a few reasons -- The first is that when expanded polystyrene gets into environment it breaks into little pieces very quickly -- And it often mixes into sand and sediments that's very hard to clean up. And in its use as part of and recyclable you can technically recycled perfectly clean polystyrene phone but once it's contaminated food you really just have to go and felt -- So that's part of why we're continuing to prioritize if a policy action. Annex I please -- As I mentioned there's not a company there is in the silver bullet to address the issue of plastic pollution -- So we're taking comprehensive approach and working with -- Other state agencies I'm going to briefly touch on a couple of different policies that the state's working on and how we're working with them. And the first I'd like to talk about is the trash amendments and these are amendments that prohibits storm water systems. From just charging trash larger than by millimeters to waters of the state. On the trusted amendments were adopted by the state water board in twenty fifteen and we're now in the early stages of implementation -- And as part of that local governments are deciding how to comply. One thing the truck commitment has done is is that is taken the costs associated with uncontrolled. Uncontrolled trash and has made that explicit -- So local government are having to pay for a full capture system to catch this trash or they're having to pay for a number of other measures that would be equivalent installing a full capture system. We're interested in how the action the policies recommended in the letter strategy could potentially help to bring those costs to local governments down -- For example if a local government fan something like expanded polystyrene they no longer have to worry about cleaning it out of there catchments and there are starving systems -- In addition to this we a PC is also committed to exploring a priority action of on looking at methods for producers and the public to share responsibility to fund the cleanup of beaches in a lot of ways that are polluted with. Different types of plastic products -- So now I'm going to move to packaging form of this is an effort that is currently being undertaken by cover cycle to develop recommendations for how the state. Should proceed with a mandatory approach to decrease the generation of packaging waste and I'm and increase packaging reuse recycling and composting -- This will include pretty sure taking increased responsibility for the end of life their packaging. A part of like our cycles taking this on is that California has that some very aggressive waste diversion goals. And packaging makes up about a quarter of the way streaming California which is why it's a priority for cover cycle to address. Most of the items that are commonly found as plastic pollution fall under this broad category of packaging the cover cycle is looking at I'm in the stakeholders at we worked with on the letter strategy are really interested in using packaging reform to promote and achieve more comprehensive source reduction. Of plastic pollution -- As part of the strategy OPC is committed to finding a report that would synthesize lessons learned from waste management policies and tools and other countries -- It and develop recommendations for California with a focus on how to use those policies policies for source reduction -- The annex I please. Taken cleared I just like to add that we're at the beginning of the strategy implementation process -- And that its intended to six years and we're excited to move the city forward [inaudible] Great. Thank you all so much -- Just kind of a start of questions and the next panel is going to look a little bit more at some of the details a bit more locally but okay OPC even those California based of the seas done a very good job of building some linkages. Internationally on issues that you're familiar with the aquarium of course is an international organization and sits between. In a lot of ways government and industry since governments regulating industry producing the aquarium as a non governmental organization I think is a tremendous amount of influence it has done a lot around the world. And then of course. Our university system as represented here by professor car. Doing a lot of research and sort of looking globally I've I looked at the slides that you had Dr Kerr this is a question actually. For for any of you. And some of the other. Data that I've shown is that yes the US produces a lot of plastic China there some sources of plastic. But if you look at the rivers that are the major conduits for plastics a lot of those are in Southeast Asia. South America and other places. Sealed my question is so what for for us of California does plastic policy are we really going to have. That big of an impact on the amount of plastics that into the ocean. So I'll I'll take the first shot at responding to that. To the work that is -- Looked at the at the distribution of that of marine debris. Has shown that it's very strongly where it's produced -- And so so. While we may not affect the production of marine debris generated by China -- If we reduce them right amount of marine debris that's generated in the United States that'll have a direct impact. On marine debris here and a bright because it's it's being restricted. To those areas where it's it's largely generated. The other -- Evidence of that is it if you look across all the basins the ocean basins around the world. The ocean basin that by far has the greatest amount of marine debris is the north Pacific because it's it lies between China and the United States so that combined production and disposal of of waste material by our two countries. Have led to the greatest concentrate globally. In an offer because thank you other comes from palace Yeah. Hang on what we can. Still instrument. Embodying. McCarty I mean that that was I will admit that was a loaded question [inaudible] Okay okay I recommend that we focus on these issues from the whole state of California is the ocean especially areas where I represent Sacramento we have. Freaks the stranger have. Annual cleanups there we could see it first hand W. said how how the plastic that gets into the ocean is mainly land base as opposed to marines apart. So that from letter or mistakes people not discarding their their their recycles properly or maybe they do and it just falls off the trash truck and go so how does it. How does it? In a picture of how it all goes sideways. I think it's it's very difficult to pinpoint about level whether someone that actually just intentionally through it on the ground versus someone to put it in the trash can and then it fell out of the trash can lid being picked up and put into a truck or something -- That level of detail is hard to pin down -- But I think it's characterizing all of as intentional littering really isn't accurate a lot of the things that we find the call to clean up their relatively small. They're easy to lose track of and so I don't think that intentional littering is. The bulk of the problem. But to reinforce whether intentional or not it is letter. And that is the primary source of this. Material that ends up. In the fresh water systems in -- Systems and then ultimately is transported to the ocean. Getting at some point is that we're doing a great job recycling trying their best but you know it happens right makes up and stuff. Fall through the cracks the winning that struck me to the show. The amount of recycling maybe where the percentage of product is that we're recycling. Is significant but the amount of volume so much greater than it was twenty years ago exactly that and then maybe while we increase recycling participation by. 70% last twenty years would be look at the actual piece right in that. In the water ways it's it's worse than decades ago right so what are some of the what are some of the and we'll get to this next but from your perspective. Three what are some of the potential remedies that we see in. States jurisdictions across the globe. They can -- They can address this. So all start and then you two can certainly take off on this but as both of of panelists emphasized its the source it's the production of the material. Right that if if there is a way to curb the amount of plastic material that we consume that we use then that will be the most significant way to reduce the amount of material that. Ends up in the ocean. And by far that's it's going right at the source of the problem that is probably the strongest solution -- And then the other activities of of the amount of recycling like you said the amount of recycling we do -- Efforts to manage that material better -- Those will help but yeah and it's all a function of just how much of this stuff we're having to cope with it unit that's easy to say but what what does that mean in practical terms for a family [inaudible] Our family. Not might be my wife for two little girls [inaudible] By. You know food and products. To you no washer closer laundry and so forth so we're buying just consumption of stock. Does it is it choices that we're making the things differently or is it. Requiring manufacture things differently regarding to produce you know biodegradable containers that are so aye based don't nine what. What are the? Are the best solution. It I think it's gonna there's a lot of different ways we got into the problem with plastic being around everything that we use so I think there's a lot of families were going to get out of it so it is. It is both -- Consumers. Making the choices with their pocketbooks with their wallets and deciding what they're going to buy which will send a signal to the market that we we don't want everything wrapped in single use plastic all the time it's also. Things like the legislation that we've just passed around single reducing the use of straws as well as requiring that packaging be either recycling. Recyclable are composed ball as state facilities so there are different ways and I think that we Ana on a more global. Macro level of looking at our markets we to our businesses that we need some different choices there's not a a as Holly said a silver bullet right now there's not it. No one's invented -- A new kind of less problematic plastic just yet however. We can work towards those types of solutions. I just wanted to add that on there is I think a role for packaging redesign and source reduction a lot of what we find and beaches are things like bottle caps -- And if you can attach caps the bottle so that you don't end up having this lease cap on to you you know twisted off your model. It's a great way. To prevent that from getting was in the environment -- I know Assemblymember's down as authored some bills are not in the past [inaudible] The Friedman. I have two questions the first is -- Regulatory when an American ship or California ship were voter any vessel goes to see. To we have control over it regulatory relief once it gets outside of U. S. waters. Or they just can do whatever they want because they're no longer in U. S. waters to use you and if you don't know that's fine we can find out. Anybody now I do not no I I unfortunately do not know ninety my account of that's something I'm curious about. And secondly I'm wondering if any of you know of any analysis of cost I'm thinking about beverage bottles particularly beverage containers of cost between glass and plastic. And how that analysis breaks down you know including transportation and everything else that. The manufacturer the the bottlers have or have any data that's nobody did I don't expect it answer the question right now. But you know of any data that's available on that. You know I don't know whether that's been there's been analyses for then I suspect the next panel members. May be able to respond to that better actually okay and TM. What is that? The couple repairers ships are US flag there is some jurisdiction over a shift that is in international waters that is moving to the United States ships that are not US flag there is no guard little or no jurisdiction. So if there's an accident or a dumping of classics very little we can do about it. If that ship is on its way into US port there might be. More that can happen but once it to U. S. B. ship to they have to follow our rules even if they're in international waters it yes of its US flag. It is but most of the commerce is with ships that are not US Five this car. Thank you for the quick questions -- To the you know by I think a lot of this has to do both market based upon demand it also -- Dave your change -- Regulation can for some of that and I was very product number and found that it was on the council we're the first big city to ban. Single use plastic of all for all retail -- And we saw the results of that the band -- Polystyrene for take out -- The restaurants adapted very quickly and customers appreciated it -- And so. In that same vein. What as as we look at the regulatory side of a what of how we can force the issue? Because of the scale and the scope of the problem I think is waiting and waiting for a market based solution -- Isn't good enough -- End. Waiting just for individual behavior change when people are making consumer families witness who decisions. Yeah they might want to try to do the right thing as much as they can but and the day. They they have a limitation on how much they can pay for things and it the costs are skewed. Towards more by really friendly. Being more expensive and then there needs to be -- Some kind of up impact on market forces and so for this panel as well as the next may have some insight on this -- Are there. Technologies -- In and and send a card to touch on a little bit other some technologies. Alternatives to plastics that we're seeing that our scalable yet or we just because I know that there are some. Builders are starting to make some bottles at our plant days to stardom a surly make utensils what have you but I I don't believe it's scalable to the to the extent regular place. Plastic production and does regulation help get us there in terms of forcing the issue to create. That demand but because that's where the supply side innovation oftentimes comes from You can. Two of the ecologists will respond -- If. The is an excellent question and you nailed it on the head -- This question of of where do you where do the consumer behavior -- Solutions lie verses the regulatory the incentives and disincentives lie and so that analysis I think is critical -- And there are other fields fisheries management which is when I work in more -- Is really looks at the the potential importance of consumer decisions and where those are most effective rather relative to regulatory actions. On but I think the are you Asians that are emerging now are in fact scalable. And the the question is how do you scale them do you use that mechanism of consumer behavior. And or do you use the regulatory. And imagine might be a combination of both Alexakis wait for one or the other by itself and then -- Another another note that it seems quite apparent that it's really smaller plastics are plastic that are broken down into smaller pieces are causing. An enormous issues that just. But this really is laws -- Operationally it's easier to capture. Last night with water damage control and sounds a we have the scrubbers and you can see. It's picking up these larger pieces but clearly you know it it's bottle caps are small those the what does of the items that have a greater chance. Of of following through so I agree that -- Kind of focusing on ways to cut back on the need for some of those smaller plastics as summer stone is worked on and I know that -- There may be other areas in terms of the kind of plastics it that's used its ability to be able to break down exacerbate existing intact. I I think -- Would have an impact certainly on the oceans. Your first question I know there are -- Some innovation centers in California and that are doing materials innovation for plastic alternatives -- To the best of my knowledge none of those are scalable yet but it is an ongoing area of research and there's a lot of interest. And I think there's not a lot of answers on the micro. Plastics issue because there's it's a brand new issue and I think a lot a lot of research necessarily but the fact that they're finding micro. Plastics in bottled water people's blood streams lots of places that are alarming is something that. The is an issue we need to be talking about. An end what's interesting as well from you you referred correctly to the straw bale that it's more of a straw options bill. But the power of even though that's and options bill the power of having the conversation. There are. People across the country that are very worried about the straw band that came out of California. And the more they're talking about it is a strong bad starts to have the desired effect of making people think about whether they want. To use straws or not in fact we were in a restaurant last night and offered straws that we were told not plastic its cellulose. It wasn't it was plastic. But the there's lots of confusion but it is interesting just having a conversation and and the opportunity for people to take some responsibility and and some awareness. I think that's one of the biggest impacts that we can have by having these conversations. Yeah but we also have to be careful of how it's interpreted I'm I was really happy to hear that Starbucks was moving away from any classics Ross anywhere in the country. With a lot less thrilled about that when I found out they were individually wrapping all of their paper straws in plastic. Which they are have in which they are doing and so on is not I guess the message got partially there but yeah. That's interesting I I had. Right other questions from the assembly members. I think we'll move on that thank you very much to this panel that was very interesting and will call up. It'll be. After today from save our shores Tim guns rob from Santa Cruz County and Charles hug from Republic services. Please come and join us. Is. This your power plants Yes of everybody and see if -- The best the best [inaudible] Unless a Waldron member Reginald. Welcome so again with they would similarly just have the analyst give us their their perspectives on next steps that will will go in order. For the day Mister nonprofit Mister how good. So please welcome. The morning everyone and thank you assembly member stone and McCarty -- For inviting me here to speak this is a subject that's very near and dear to my heart as it's something that we work in every day -- I also have a strong background in plastics and plastic pollution having worked. For almost ten years -- With an organization called. Which is a spin off of eco designer bill McDonough for those of you may know that name -- Is so I've worked a long time on issues of plastic especially with the plastic -- Packaging sector -- But that's another story so they will stay focused on weight saver shorts is doing -- Next slide please -- Probably knew all of you from Santa Cruz and even though it's from other parts of the state may know then savor Chaudhry's. It's been around for forty years now this is our fortieth anniversary and we've been protecting being marine ecosystem along the central coast and particularly within the boundaries of that. Monterey Bay national marine sanctuary for those forty years for decades we've worked on everything from the original oil and gas drilling threat which we've now come full circle in our dressing again under. A small T. little any trump administration -- We are have also don't with. Cruise ships marine acoustics -- More recently the plastic pollution we've dealt with sand mining on your insurance and we take on most issues that affect that the health and well being of our coastal environment. Next line -- Last year two thousand seven we came out with a new vision twenty twenty five and strategy that will guide our work for at least the next ten years and possibly beyond. And when the strategy process we asked what conditions would we need to have a thriving Monterey Bay and we came up with the three pillars. That are guiding our strategies and tactics the habitats and living waters of course plastic pollution affects all three of those conditions next. So it the problem which is really become a crisis and I think it's elevated to the point of crisis on a global level next line. So back in the nineteen fifties plastics were first introduced into the world to and this is a picture from life magazine. Some of you were old enough to remember that publication many probably not -- And that this was you know like wow all excited American how his wife you're going to be. Free from washing dishes and making food and everything else we had plastics and processed food came on the market and life is good and wonderful and in sort of a convenience mindset really took hold to the consumer inconvenience mindsets next. But today we see a whole different picture we've gone and sort of these roughly sixty sixty five years from a love affair with plastics. To heed affair with plastic in in you know major super concern around the globe and protests and you know people demanding that we take action on this crisis that's taken over. Our globin in particular our most important resource the ocean. Next. So packaging is really sort of the poster child for our current economic system in consumer -- Economy which is basically a take make waste systems very winning your we take resources from the earth we turn it into a product we use it often for a very brief period of time. And we just throw it away except there is no away -- This is actually a can of what I think is the sad state of recycling especially in this country we have probably one of the worst -- Recycling rates in the world even though we are one of the most highly technologically involved countries -- You can see here 78% of the U. S. waste stream could be recycled that means there are actually. Techniques and across the seas that can recycle that material but we're only recycling around Is rounded up it's like -- Twenty seven again so we've gone from love to hate and here are some of the reasons why you know we have eight million metric tons of plastic going into or ocean. Every year we have -- Two point five billion metric tons of solid waste produced around the world every year -- It you know there's one study out there that. Not really tongue in cheek but I think not entirely accurate me I either because we actually don't know how many fish are in the scene but there's a study out there that says by twenty fifty if we keep on the path we're going to be more plastic than fish. Inner ocean -- Master here some later statistics from our data collection needs are twenty seventeen numbers. We see cigarette* you sure -- Up at the top and for those of you who don't know that is the plastic litter problem it's not a paper filter it's made of a polymer. They don't know exactly assembly but it's it's plastic pollution all those cigarette* we see. And I think that those are. Maybe not intended an instances of later but certainly thoughtless instances of later where people test. Done throw it. And we learned behavior for movies and TV and you know everything for your for decades and decades -- Yes let's get to the solutions which you know I think that has a lot to do with smart policy. So our theory of change and save our shores is based on awareness advocacy in action and those are the primary ways that we drive positive change. So often you know -- Our role is to make people aware of the issue and where of some of the solutions in ways that they can change their behavior we to a lot of that through formal education. We believe you know we have an opportunity to teach the next generation not. To climb onto the convenience lifestyle -- To better understand that there is no one way when we throw things away that there is -- Consequences and soon bill generations that have a greater environmental ethics and then we did in previous generations -- Advocacy -- We ever local lawmakers that city level regional county level and state level -- And we had a lot of success and sort of driving some of these policies to to be enacted especially in our local communities. Inter action you know all of it is action really but we also are able to turn out literally thousands like eleven thousand volunteers the year to help us. Do our education and outreach support or advocacy work in a lot of it to come out and clean up our shores we had. Over three thousand volunteers came out for one day on annual coastal cleanup day which is also international coastal cleanup day. In removed well over eleven thousand pounds of trash and like three hours that one day next. So some packaging bands that save our shores started without the local level ways. Able to get past in the in many of our incorporated cities and Santa Cruz in Monterey county as well as the counties themselves -- You know we've had polystyrene band going back from. To the twenty ten to one talk more about that some just gonna kind of glossed over that for now also plastic bags we were when in the first. Communities Santa Cruz and Monterey county center and incorporated areas that. Did a plastic bag band and I think we got something like fifty six ordinances passed in local regional area and then as we see that became a state wide success story. Anna. Sort of attacked by citizen support to make sure that we kept that law on the books and we're the only state that has it. And then -- We expanded our poly styrene ordinance in sap is Santa Cruz County to include other to go food service where like straw is -- Non recyclable are nine composed Monique you. On the Philippines. When you meet with? You can thank you -- In even stronger see we actually know what the state law. An option bill or whatever you call it in sacks Santa Cruz really do have a straw man is now in supposed to go. We can't. Give it out if it's not recyclable and compostable and then in the restaurants no it has to be on demand so in effect we have a strong band here next Of so -- Policy work really does pay office you can see. On the left -- Poly styrene numbers in two thousand eight before we had any kind of the ordinances we're about. Yes significant levels of trash collected. Going down down down. in or download data collection is in the normally where it has gone back up but we think this is a two year is where we did. We started our extreme clean up pro. Some of the caves and other you know areas along the shores that are hard to access up into the rocks and boulders more into the dunes and working with -- Even the am U. S. navy and cleaning some of their doing sites are we would get out. Yeah probably twenty five thousand pounds of trash from homeless camps to just abandon stuff for years and years and years. And then you know after extreme cleanups cleanup so went down you can see we're back to pretty low levels of poly styrene -- Mostly what we see here now chunks of it links probably from coolers and always sorts of things. And then -- In terms of bags it's a really clear. Success in terms of how policy helps and smart policy works. We didn't even have the bump up in the twenty thirteen twenty fourteen when you were doing are extreme cleanups. Next. So going forward we have some ambitious plans on the local level -- Which we hope will eventually go up to the state level we have six items that were targeting right now and we have already approach thingy -- Board of supervisors in Santa Cruz and the city council in Santa Cruz will be reaching out to the other incorporated areas and Santa Cruz probably before the end of this week and into monitoring. Next week and what we're asking for is. Some kind of a solution for the six problem so we have the tiny little toiletry bottles and we've all seen in hotels. They hardly even ever get used even if they do they're not for we used all of that is put into the trash every day thousands of bottles. Much of industry is already starting to move in the direction of eliminating those in favor of of well known and dispensers we have asked. For an ordinance in Santa Cruz County in the city and we will be in to these other jurisdictions. That the use of those in the hospitality industry be banned in favor of one mounted. Really pleased to say we have a board of super this initiative and the county. In will probably on an ordinance by the end of the year. In the company of the will is. What might be fun actually playing no real needed purpose and world -- It yet you know they cause a lot of problems in terms of being let go drifting in New York oceans and tangled the stuttering cetera -- Also ingestion where scan for a ban on the sale balloons on in the county. And we will start with the mylar balloons which are actually more problematic than simple latex but we'd like to see them all. Eliminated. Contact lenses and interesting when it came on our radar screen only about a month and a half two months Max ago and this was as a result of a study that came out I of all people the American chemistry council. And keep sort of playing with why would they put the study out and the only reason I can think of is to takes are to blame on industry or the focus off of industry as the problem and put it on consumers as the problem because the issue here is. That one out of five users of the daily disposables. Question down the toilet. We don't want that to happen because the water treatment facilities can't deal with that their screens at Saturn not small enough to collect and send these training at all. Maker plastic products. On their way for plastics even in their full state or being fly straight into our waterways and inter ocean. In becoming you know we we're not seeing it so much nobody's. Reporting the pick up of contact lenses honor they're so we'd like some kind of a take back. Current extended producer responsibility long time to deal with not taking contacts and we from people for sure. On the giving them away to take them back to drop them off and have the manufacturing deal with them. Micro fibers is kind of the newest thing on the radar screen this is little pieces sort of like -- Strand of hair that just flops off your Palmer base closings -- Every time that you wash it and so is simple solution there is installation of filters on washing machines -- You know even the more expensive ones are only about a hundred and fifty dollars so we're asking that. All commercial laundry facilities which would be the laundry service says laundromats dry cleaners -- Hospitality industry that still does their own laundry and apartment complexes with multiple laundry machines install filters on them so that we can begin to stop the flow of that through our waterways and into the ocean. Hi too many people today can't as a convenience have have bought your rank and espresso coffee tape machines were you put in a little tiny get you one Cup of coffee. You just dump the pod and in the trash. And those are not recyclable learning compostable and its first -- Does have a take back program so we're not targeting without those pod so much but the pods that are not recyclable are composed of only blank ban on the sale of those. In our community and then the whole the plastic bottles -- We know that in our communities most people are already using reusable drinking containers. Nine is we want to finally put a stop to the sale of those single use. The water bottles anything under a gallon [inaudible] And if I were clean it when being all beverage bottles all plastic beverage bottles but when we can put out hydration stations for people to go water we can't necessarily put them out for people that. We fail a coke or juice or something mobile for you. And Katharine for queen here -- So I'm gonna wrap it up there -- And if you have any morning join our campaign just contact me. Clean ups you can contact air. Volunteer so she it and then you know check out our website for what else we're doing thank you Thank you. This without her. What we're waiting for the presentational out I thought I'd ask? How many of you came here from out of town today? Quite a few. Well if you look around and as you ride you can see. Why were so Phillies fiercely protective of our local environment here we have? A lot at stake. And it's one of the big reasons why so many. Innovations environmental protection began right here in Santa Cruz County. And I'm gonna share a few of those with you today. Next slide please. We a one of the most comprehensive environmental education programs in this county that you'll find. Anywhere. Every child in school yes education in. Elementary school and beyond. They all learn to recycle it practices every day at school they all learn about. Composting their food waste many of them get to work in their school gardens and learn about the benefits of compost. We have a program through on you'll see us see where children can. Go out on a boat on the bay. And actually take up samples look at plankton under a microscope and see for themselves. The plastic pollution in our waters and learn about the impacts of that. So they get a very thorough understanding. Of how the way that they live their lives affects the environment around them. And that's something that they carry with them as they go through life [inaudible] Next line. We also do a lot to educate the general public we have newsletters that go out to every home and business several times year. We have constant ads in the print media. On TV and on radio if your local you probably hear these. Every day urging people not to litter remember to recycle and other versions of that and one of the challenges that all of us in coastal communities in particular have is. How do we educate the the hordes of visitors that we get especially in the summer? About respecting our local environment and what you see on the lower left there. Is an experiment we tried a few years ago using our buses as rolling billboards. And we had San and similar ones at on buses all over the county you could hardly miss them they were. Controversy all but to me that that was a good thing they got people's attention. Next slide please. Hey. As was mentioned earlier we are facing such a tsunami of plastic. That all our best efforts at recycling are not enough we have to go after the source. And we have done that in numerous ways locally and in the twenty but a few of those next. Poly styrene as was mentioned. It is a very difficult product to recycle properly. Because it's so frequently contaminated with food residue. Because of its lightweight its bulky miss it's low value. Economically and logistically just rarely makes sense to recycle if. So as Catherine mentioned. There's a taper. Off excellent. In -- Two thousand eight senators county was among the first to prohibit the use of styrofoam and food service. But we were still seeing it our parks on our beaches serve few years later we took the next step. Of saying are you cancel the stuff in our county anymore is people were going to the store and buying styrofoam cooler styrofoam cups other similar products. Taking it to the beach and leaving it there. We very rarely see that anymore as Catherine mansion. Prohibiting retail sales of poly styrene from products. Has. Almost completely solve that problem next please. Plastic bags Chen Cruz County was among the very first. To initiate a ban on single use plastic bags -- Because there was so little track record we weren't really sure what the impact is going to be so we sent teams out to local shopping areas to monitor. Our people handling this are they getting paper bags of the they buying bags are they doing with our they bring in their own. We found the remarkably within thirty days of the effective date of that ordinance. More than 90% of local shoppers were bringing their own backs. As in Santa of in a mitigation -- For we had some wonderful reusable bags made a here's an example it said. Organic cotton that. Grounded manufactured in the US made with non VOC a stack of these are in the back of the room so please help yourself to learn on their way out it's the best shopping bag you'll ever had. We've given out thousands of these. M. by our estimate we've reduce the use of single use plastic bags just in this little county. By a hundred million bags a year Thanks. For as Catherine mentioned -- Last year we took another significant step -- We told our food service businesses from now on everything you. Is guided the recyclable or compostable. Enemies recyclable by our standards so a controversial examples been the plastic straws Wilder. Made of a material that is technically recyclable because their small size and weight. They tend to slip through all the recycling machinery so practically. They're not recyclable they're no longer allowed you will no longer find plastics rose is Santa Cruz County businesses. Same is true of plastic stir state pencils -- You may not be aware that -- If you buy a Cup of coffee to go. That paper Cup is lined with plastic but not in Santa Cruz County. In there many other similar changes that we've implemented. Beginning almost two years ago now and it's been extremely effective. The excellent. I mentioned where we tend to innovate -- It's it's both a blessing and sometimes it occurs that there's so much. Support here for environmental protection that -- People -- Tend to give us kudos for about a week and then they want to know what else you got. So we're always looking to do more. And often because we go first. We hear from other cities counties other states even other countries how did you do this can I get a copy. How can we do that? In you should is duplicated many many times -- Ordinances that were first introduced in Santa Cruz County. Have been adopted in San Francisco Seattle. Boulder Colorado New York City many other places. Next slide please. I want to talk a little bit about working with big business sometimes when we talk about these issues we see them as the problem as the enemy. And I want to encourage people to think about the opportunities for partnerships. We have found that the leverage provided. By a well crafted initiative even at the local level even a small jurisdiction like this. Can have profound consequences and we have lots of examples of those and I just mention a couple here that I want to share with you -- When we introduce the bad I Poly starring from in food service? All local businesses got on board very quickly some of the national chains set up. Are we gonna do this. And we talked to the local managers and it's a you know we get this stuff from a warehouse at a Denver or Chicago or Dallas. Is sorted at the corporate level we have nothing to say about what we use. You're going to have to talk to the corporate office so we didn't that. And sometimes it was easy sometimes it was a struggle cold stone creamery was a struggle you may be familiar with them there at nationwide ice cream chain and at that time. They were serving all of their ice cream. And polystyrene foam balls and they like them they worked well they're cheap they were easy. But we told him we gotta get rid of them. And I I'll simplify a lot of backing for discussion. They finally called and said okay we're going to do it's a great. So you change out the supplies in your local store. The sudden -- That's too much trouble we're gonna change of all fourteen hundred stores nationwide. Because of a local ordinance. Senate he mentioned Starbucks we went through a similar process with them. More recently some of you may remember several years ago. Starbucks trumpeted as a nation initiative to recycle all of their products. And it was an abysmal failure stuff was actually going to the landfill. They were really embarrassed they failed burned. They were reluctant to go through that again. And yet they are serious about becoming more sustainable as many companies are some of them really just. Trying to do this as a marketing measure but many of them are serious and they just need a little help to figure out how. Knowing that about Starbucks we talk to their corporate office in Seattle and said look. We're introducing these new rules locally it's only gonna affect four stores in Santa Cruz County. Why don't you see this as an experiment? It'll work so well here. Maybe you can introduce some of this more broadly. Well it worked out very well and some of you probably saw their press release. A few months ago that based on their success in Santa Cruz County the rolling out these changes to more than twenty eight thousand stores around the world. As referred there still some glitches they still have some more work to do but they're making progress and we're happy to help them. Next slide please. Catherine mentioned some of the things in the pipeline and I'll tell you just a bit more about them -- One of our problems and she mentioned. Is those millions of little plastic bottles of personal care products in hotels and motels Mostra which get. Thrown away at the end of every day because it's not practical for housekeeping to determine whether they've been used or not is incredibly wasteful. On November twentieth we're going to be introducing an ordinance to require hotels and motels in Santa Cruz County. To switch to refill. Six we are confident that once this is implemented people everywhere else are going to say again. Why we think of that let's do that [inaudible] I am. We heard a little bit about plastic micro fibers. This may be in new issue to some of you. Most of our close these days are made of synthetic fibers and every time you do a load of laundry. As many as hundreds of thousands of micro fibers are shot by those close the passed right through waste water treatment plants out to the rivers lakes and oceans. What is Catherine mentioned there's a P. simple solution? They're already filters on the market they're easy to install their widely available they're very affordable. So we're going to be introducing an ordinance and to require the installation of these filters on washing machines we're going to begin with commercial establishments. And hopefully phase in all washing machines over the course of the next three years. And again it's something that we expect to see become widespread. And if you want to be as to the punch and do it at the state level I'd be happy to work with you. Next slide please. So there's more to come but I'm gonna start there but before I finish I want to offer a special thank you. The innovations that we've we've created in this county would not be possible without. Courageous political leadership. Some of you know the before you joined the assembly. Mark stone was a Santa Cruz County super in a lot of the measures that I've discussed happen under his leadership. Sir thank you for that mark. Alright thank you. Charles welcome. Thank you good morning. Assembly member stone. Cartier Friedman and Kalra on Chuck help get -- Director of government affairs for public services. On all dispensed with the usual company credits by simply saying that Republic services is a national solid waste services company. Appalling operations recycling operations composting operations in landfills across California. And plastics are a major part of what we what we do -- I'm very pleased to be invited here today -- As I guess the token waste management presenter -- Is specifically on that account I'll discuss the impacts that China swords -- Has on a recycling operations touch on recyclability. Excuse me plastics and briefly discuss policy options next slide please. Even before China -- Shut the door on recyclable commodities we're seeing a significant decline in class prices. Of 40% decline in. And cardboard. Late last year. China basically slammed the door on on mixed paper and many plastics do their restrictions on on cross contamination -- How does this relate to plastics are mature cover facilities are constructed to handle single products? For the most part -- Even was sources we have comical recycle so we must process and separate. And and turn into a recyclable commodity -- Cross contamination of recyclables or off spec plastics are largely responsible for contamination. In our paper loads -- Reducing the value and reducing recyclability of those materials. Slide three please. Shows you some of the trends that have occurred and materials management from our perspective -- This material trends of also increased contamination and the increase recycling costs And they've also increased consumer misunderstanding I think it was truly recyclable -- Is example newsprint has virtually disappeared it was a large part of our are wonderful recycling numbers that we've had in the past retributive to news print -- But newsprint is disappearing we're we're now reading are. Our news on our telephones and and we're not ordering or getting newspapers delivered -- HSDPA which is recycling which is a recycle commodity -- Is being replaced by lighter weight off spec PT. Hard to distinguish between the two and when you. Run those through a every facility it is virtually impossible. On ten cans of a replacement on recycled local PA a copolymer -- Pouches. And water bottles are increasingly being light weighted requiring more containers baton of recyclable materials recycle plastics. And again increasing shipping costs and processing because for us. Next slide please. China swords reduce contamination -- Late last year 25% in band all mixed paper. I'm driving costs across the board and recycling facilities -- Requiring increased -- Processing time slowing or or material recovery facilities lines down adding additional people to the pick lines -- And all these. Dramatically increased our costs. And while markets in Vietnam went in and with the market disappearing in China but will markets growing in Vietnam in India to some degrees help the prices -- Prices continue to be very very deflated for most commodities. Slide. Five I'm just a this is a brief summary of our really simplistic cost structure -- Our costs. Of our recycling programs that we pass on to rate payers are based on collection costs. Plus processing costs. Plus disposal of residuals. Minus commodity prices. When cost increases sales price decrease went up and operating loss preventing investment to newer? And better recycling infrastructure. Next slide please. This chart is from cal recycle and reflects the again the dramatic decline. In the China market for recyclable materials. And and we all know what we've heard the impact of China sorts on mixed papers and all but I I think what's striking here is well there weren't a lot of plastics going there. Those mark mark to virtually -- Been shut off completely. Next slide please. So. Can we recycle our way out of out of plastic pollution -- I would submit that the answer to that question is no. Not at least with our current economic model in our current -- Solid waste recycling infrastructure -- That model has been broken by by China's swords a minute somewhere is. Broken in a way that has made us rethink what we do and how we handle recycling -- Across the board not just in California but across the country -- We've. Become accustomed to shipping materials to to China with excessive amounts of contamination. And that is no longer a possibility. Sorry moving in non recyclable plastic contamination food contamination off specs plastic and any plastics three through -- Seven increases Acosta processing -- And the value of our commodities are be reduced at and at the same time the value of our materials are are are commodities are be reduced by at least half. So again this is a model that can survive from an economic perspective. And that means more of these recycled plastics wind up our landfills and increasingly high costs. And potentially more on our lands and in our waterways sisters costs increase and an illegal dumping -- Increases as well. A just single example of of a and I like to use the highlight this -- Very the flexible plastics are very large problem for us -- They're very light -- This certainly serve a useful purpose and I want to talk about flexible plastic sandwich bags would be an example -- Stretch plastic -- Around your the shrink wrap it goes around packaging -- They they serve useful commercial purposes there's no no doubt about that but these materials. All there are less than 4% of our commodities stroke or our waste stream. Are about 70% of our problems. And those problems again or cross contamination the fact that they're indistinguishable in optical sorters inner discs orders from paper -- Their let eight create literate our facilities -- And a increasingly create equipment failures are facilities particularly the shrink wrap materials which tend to get wrapped in toward discs orders and shut down our operations. Next slide please -- Our existing and and we saw earlier slide that somewhat resembles this but right now our our our existing plastic recycling system council. And in a significant way on a bottle bill one might many of our revenues a commensurate your recovery facilities are result of the bottle bill -- With merriment the minimum recycle content requirements and there are some some bands and most recently a state level the the single use plastic bag ban. Next slide please. So so policy considerations -- That that at least I would throughout forward for discussion today -- And whatever we do I I really do think we need to consider the true cost of recycling. In and focus our efforts on that which is is truly recyclable -- Consider minimum content were recycling opportunities -- Infrastructure and markets support that form for coverage -- Or that fails focus efforts on extended producer responsibility any PR. Reuse and and potentially mandatory take back programs. Of for the very very hard to manage materials -- User fees for disincentive certainly have something that we have talked about -- They can be a disincentive for they can also be used as incentives to support more effective and broader recycling programs -- And I think we we we can't state enough and I think you've seen it on many of the slides here from from this panel particularly. Consumer education is is is critical contamination issue starts -- In it and it is from our perspective it starts from from the generator of the waste -- We can we can certainly talk about how we must change the the plastics waste stream but again consumer consumer education on what they by. And how they treat their recyclables what they throw in the recycling bins is is really critical to our success recycling. Thank you [inaudible] Thank you. What what's interesting was a lot of the impetus here's Santa Cruz County for making some of these changes? Was fifteen years ago realization the landfill was going to close. Add. Try to find another site. In a small county which proved absolutely impossible. That force people to think differently about waste and waste management and ensuring that we had resources in the county instead of sending things out. Took responsibility. For what we were using how we were using at and that made it a lot easier to generate the political will for the plastic bag ban the polystyrene a number of those initiatives because I think the population. Woken up to taking responsibility. It's interesting China's kind of the same thing to us by closing those markets. It should be shameful that our solutions are shipping things off to other countries. Adding to their burdens just because of our convenient. And so the the current state I'm hoping in this is why it's very good having. This. Waste side focus on this panel we had lots of discussions around. Plus the pollution plastic products plastic is here to stay I don't think we're getting rid of it. But how we reduce it how we be responsible across the spectrum from manufacturing manufactured choices distribution choices which will have to do with the packaging and and distribution and then end of life. And finding a better way for everyone to take responsibility that's that was. Actually the impetus for getting things done here waking up because nobody wanted a landfill their backyard. And we're going to be shipping about a state bearing of stuff in the desert who knows what which is the all has catastrophic consequences. And so it's great to see some of those solutions politically some of those obviously are going to be easier. Than others but getting Californians to understand the impact of the decisions that they may. Have that we can't we we no longer have options just to take that stuff shipped away out of sight out of mind the take responsibility for what we what we use here. I think will be helpful. But difficult as we move through the process so that they get a I think you for offering solutions and looking at what's possible. And in and the difficult conversations of folks have and a member with the plastic bag band. Save our shores was helpful in putting data medially soon as that was proposed so I reduction in plastic bags in the environment long before the origins took a fact so again. That public education the discourse has a has its desired effect and in changing people's behavior. So other questions this Friedman I have a question I have a question about -- How Santa Cruz does enforcement with their local ordinances and I was thinking again about? Being last night at a restaurant which is literally on the pier. And being given without request plastic straws so it's one thing to have -- Businesses that are compliant because they want to be but what do you do about the out liars like that and do you have. You have some sort of enforcement mechanism and how does that work. We do. Of begin by saying in this particular case although I work for the county and the work is in the city. I'm going to be contacting my colleagues at the city when I leave here and left another something here for you to follow up on on and I do that all the time we do it for each other they called me as well. All of our ordinances included in for spent provisions penalties for violations. Our emphasis is more on education in compliance when we find problems we often learn that it's a new employee it's a misunderstanding so. Our first step is to try to help people comply -- But but there are sticks in the ordinances we can levy substantial penalties and on the rare occasions where we found reluctance the the knowledge of that has been a powerful incentive. We also have another very school available to us here. And that's are very environmentally conscious residents -- I guarantee you that a lot of local people if they stop in that same residents restaurant. Going to say what the heck are you doing. This is plastic this is not allowed you have to deal with this right now. And a lot of businesses that would be much more responsive to an average customer then they're going to be to a call for me. So we use all of those things and we really see very high levels of compliance This car. Thank you and and thanks the presentation -- And I think -- One of the well one of the common themes is. That. Local governance local regional actions are or in some ways kind of the the pilot programs or the the the experimental place where you can experiment whether it's just topics working with local governments trying something out doesn't work. Try something different -- And kind of having that opportunity for the laboratory but I think. A lot of the companies that are more forward thinking understand consumer preference -- And what's coming down the road and so if they see what's happening in Santa Cruz and Berkeley. That it's gonna mention happening in Francisco LA. San Jose and its attention compass in the California and so for a smart company will pay attention as a with a second this is where. A ventrally consumer choice is going to get as we get more educated as people have more options and choices they're gonna start making the choices that are good for themselves health wise. Good for the planet -- And what have you and so -- Even when we're doing our plastic bag and literally being internet goes this was before it was a fact giving reusable bags to people and explaining what was coming down the road in the red reality is that people. The card that you get some postal complain about a little bit about the initially that behavior changes. And then allows the state -- To use the path that you now have a couple together a bunch of local jurisdictions the now create the momentum to do it at a state level. And so I really appreciate. What you're doing? Here in this region as a really important laboratory for the nation. In terms of pushing forward things that yeah you know what tomorrow if we introduce in Sacramento will go through maybe not. But intentionally because the work you're doing allows us as legislators that. That certainly. You know want to move in the direction you're going. The ability to be able to point to data point to facts point to consumer choice -- In a very meaningful way some very grateful for that and so thank you for that as well as the industry respect that look you know and I think floor as question the prior. Panel about spot with those are all things that we have to be cognizant of because if we get these major retailers is major -- Companies to come on board that's huge and that creates momentum for others jump on board because obviously the the public publicity. And PR and people wanting to do the right thing well you know if a company like Starbucks gonna do then I feel better about Starbucks and going there as a consumer well guess what the other companies are charging. Too and so knowing the data on what the cost is to both of the the companies they're supplying the products. As well as to recyclers and the challenges they have because it's easy to say always recycle everything about solve the problem and and hearing the challenges with that helps us then it would be create policies a wall. Of the policies are created were really good twenty years ago they don't actually work today for the recyclers and other things that we can do better so I'm I I think this conversation's really helpful. For me Texas that that think about and how we move forward as a state but again encouraging that local -- Energy and the the the local activism is as important. For that question about the plastic and glass. They have been studies done. In in in these studies are mostly called life cycle assessments and life cycle cost assessments. In you know often plastic is going to turn out from the life cycle assessment to be the material of choice it's light weight it's an expensive. Theoretically it's recyclable you put all of those things into his study with boundaries that are set by. The researcher or that or the study conductor. In you can pretty much get the answer that you want. But in terms of plastic verse plastic is much later. Much less expensive. And so there's been this mass migration away from plot glass bottles to plastic bottles because it also reduces greenhouse gas when you're transporting. You know billions of glass bottles around the country and around the globe we're talking about you know heavy containers a lot more -- Energy for transport at center and the green greenhouse gases go up. Would actually require me using a glass bottle forty times. To equal the same greenhouse gas level in reductions is using one plastic bottles you have to recycle that glass forty we use that not recycling actually we use it. And I think the challenge there is that we've gone in this global economy. When I was a kid I used to take my coke bottles yes I drink coke as a kid? I used to take him back to the corner store put him in a little. You know look like a a crate you know with what's in it for each bottle. And they would take them to see that local bottling facility maybe thirty forty miles away washed and sterilised them in you know come back out on the market and they all looked can't. Cool all scratched up and cloudy and sort of fun you know. And no they can't do that they're about three glass manufacturers in the country. If you were gonna collect glass bottles and send them from Florida to Colorado where there is a glass re processor. Were talking a lot of money but we are seeing some some of the local breweries begin to do that especially in Colorado where they do have a glass facility. So they are often the furries themselves are taking them back re watching them in. Sterilizing them and putting them back out on the market but but the real you know who the real. Issue is greenhouse gasses associated with the heavier materials. Mr. card sure this. Couple observations first. So you use the examples of John which you said [inaudible] Tom. Ten year old twin girls let job which is -- And so you know the used to be of course this fire phone. Containers. But and now they transitioned at as you said but last night. So you go from really bad day kind of bad so they don't break down in that stuck in the sand. But there entities that. Cannot be recycled so. I guess that's a win but it's not. A perfect -- So just kind of you have to remind yourself that by making this transition from cold stone the same scenario there from the ice cream phone to that. Cardboard line thing that's not recyclable -- And and the issue that we're gonna face if. Any four of us I'm sure we support many measures have not offer them ourselves. Is -- When we try to get these things pass of the state level as? Like food containers with other compostable recyclable. If the cost passed on to consumers is going. To in our RD raising their gas taxes and you know and minimum wage increases and you hear from the opposition all these arguments left and right. So how do we respond to that are are there any examples for you. Is how much has that. Item of whatever product -- Gonna. Cost or has stayed the same. When we me EMTs efforts? That was a concern -- The availability -- Truly recyclable and compostable food service products was limited the quality was somewhat uneven -- Sometimes the performance left something to be desired I personally experience putting a compostable spoon and nobles super watching and Mel. We've come a long way. I mentioned the rules we implemented last year requiring all of those food service materials to be recyclable and compostable. Before we ever talk to the food service businesses we talk to the distributors that the wholesalers we let him know that this is common. Is this going to be a problem for you we one of them. Not a bit. This industry has just mushroomed. There's so many products available there are many to choose from. There available for every conceivable use they perform gray. And they're very affordable so that was an issue years ago but but I can confidently say it really isn't any longer. So on the app for example styrofoam. X. poly styrene only. Like sorry. He there are the restaurants whether it's you know. Panda express what have you the national chains date counter and say now that increases -- The cost to consumers. So. When they come out? I am and I and I can show you examples that are just as affordable we've we've done the homework and I can tell you that our order supervisors always ask that question. What's going to be the impact on local businesses how is this going to affect their class and I've learned to do my homework. So when I bring a measure forward like this I'm ready with a list of twenty products for or more. Learning. As well that are readily available and don't cost anymore. So we we hear a lot -- Predictions. There's often -- No accurate information behind so they really don't cost me more money and they are. Able to be utilized. With the consumer in the same. Manner not having you know I've I've. I've bought a little -- Pressed use the straws in it falls apart after like virus so please see you gotta make sure you. So I know they're they're probably iron in summer better than other fixing those things out. So. If they really are no cost difference why would they not just to the natural it doesn't help these restaurants to be using -- The single use things that. A third maybe of their customers look at so you know what I just don't like this someone. Like Starbucks are beginning to realize that. This is not just a way to look greener. Make people happier but it makes business sense. Inertia is N. issue people are afraid of change they're used to doing things the way that they've been doing them they've. Had these long established supply change they don't see any reason to do it any differently. And it's while we institute these men those problems and offer them solutions up front because we wanted to be easy for everybody. For example if I can. On the six initiatives that we are taking on currently. I am working with for students from Middlebury Middlebury institute friends International Studies and there graduate. Sustainability program in there doing exactly this kind of research how many companies so many individual businesses in the county or in the city jurisdiction will be affected. By this ordinance will it be a cost to them only be a cost savings are there alternatives how easy and they to come. About the work we're doing that research and bringing it forward -- You know one of the reasons we're likely to see. The ban on toiletry bottles that we've asked for is because that is a cost savings to businesses and they've already discovered some of this on their own and are moving in that direction so. That's almost a no brainer for work for you folks and in the legislature to to look at and saying we can actually help these. This industry get to cost savings faster -- You know they're the higher end hotels there have been surveys done where. They say their customers will feel if they the luxury of their own personal product that hasn't been touched by anybody else but you know that's pretty much just the really. Once used Cervantes [inaudible] Pretty high. And customer in. Most of them. I don't think or even really paying attention to it we're seeing these kinds of changes across most of the hotel chain so there. It. On the actual plan think about owners are south Asian some very but it is. To turn of deregulation into changing their business models so -- It may take a little bit of time but again Santa Cruz going first and working with local hotels motels you a lot of to a big tourism industry here. Helps so much to that have large conversation with their advocacy organization. And to talk a look they're doing it there how can we do this in a way that's most would you have any sense of the it not all business of the same so when we did. A poly styrene for take out in San Jose we did. Plastic bags we had a different time frame for the larger. One companies that I've economies of scale of the the franchises and the chains had up. Had up complies sooner the small mom and pop so they have not save a bridge yeah and so that we have any sense of that with recognize a love these there that. Some of the arguments of business they're not just all by you know just all made up just to resist change there are especially the smaller businesses are some. Tensions there apps and so whatever we can do to kind of smooth it out but make sure we don't take steps backward orders or stand still that we have to keep moving. Forward and so again I think what you're doing is really helpful. Edits learning experience to for the businesses when we did the original poly styrene bad for take out. There was a great deal of concern about existing product so we actually built in and implementation that was longer but we ask them to come back and apply [inaudible] Nobody did. So they were able actually to shift to the new product much more quickly than they thought they were and so part of the implementation is giving a little bit of leeway But working with with some parameters that that can work and I think the businesses and so at for future steps that were taken those issues didn't arise because of the experience. That the businesses here had and they understood that they could in fact implement. And then I would add the in in this particular case our very first step was to meet with the local hotel and motel owners managers. And that's what do you think about this how would this affect you what kind of problems might not be aware of what do you know that we don't know. And we always take that approach with on a blind side people we want to find workable solutions. At the same time you know like I said I've spent many years in my career actually working in corporate sustainability and have consulted to a lot of companies you produced. Some of the projects that. Now on this side of the fence I'm. Looking to help eliminate. But you know at some point where we do have to look at the economics you know we are our world is driven by an economy. And arguably it's not the right economic model right now but when we need to look at that we also need to keep. Firmly planted I think even have a claim it crisis and we have a plastic policing crisis. That it won't matter if there are businesses or if we have conveniences if our ocean dice we die. That is our most important resource and if we aren't willing to step up and make the hard decisions and forests businesses from time to time to make a hard choice [inaudible] While hopefully not until after I'm dead which is often a consolation having use since I've been working in this field for over thirty years that I'll be gone before it's really bad but it's going to get really bad if we don't make some pretty hard choices pretty fast. Right. I know we were just public comment yeah we want you to overcome it and we were quick thing up I want to just notice. Make the notion here that. If we're pushing for more compostable recycling single use products we run into the issue the recycling history and we're gonna have a not I'm vibrant -- Joining these to select committees because they're they're intertwined. Really big hearing -- Nearly twenty eighteen talking about this issues [inaudible] Select -- But that one of the issues is -- Is this the reality of what's happening with China in the global market so we could push. All these products to recycling. But then if we don't have a way. To have a viable recycling -- System in California that what is what is that mean. We have stacks of contaminated. Alex of contaminated material that we can't sell any place piling up -- Merger recovery facilities and and getting weathered in getting pushed to the point at some point in time where it's weathered it can't be recycled at all. That's what we've we've really seen when China soared initially had that's leveled out some the crisis is. Still here but it's it's it's smaller but that. Many like I couldn't see any better than you than you did it. We have to be careful what we ask for sometimes and and what would push into the recycling stream. I I guess the best advice I could give this let's be really good at this it and recycling the stuff that is recycle. And make those determinations then try to figure out other alternatives to push of the material. Street and good point okay so thank you for your patience. Select committee process is a way of getting information that's what we have the panels into the legislative contacts. So now is your opportunity is members of the public to breast to address us briefly your comments. And we take all of this and for we'll. On the slick committee websites will try to post -- Power points in as much information as we can so it becomes publicly available. As education for us as well as for our colleague so if anyone would like to addresses. This is your opportunity Nicole has the microphone. Good morning this is doctor cold executive director of Cochran product stewardship council -- I want to touch on the Starbucks items I thought that was pretty in. That a year and a half ago we had discussions with a company that was creating a silica based wind. Paper Cup they approached Starbucks as an alternative to the classic wine. And the biggest problem Starbucks love the bill of the idea that the biggest problem was. They couldn't. Get enough of a made. It was a demand problem is. Scalability and so and I and I suspect now they finally figured it out in this weather able rolled out nationwide vertical while. To get that rolled out so I'm glad to see if get witness plus going cut -- So -- Governor posters of counsel's in the PR expert we're here to help -- Assembly members are always open to come to see you help yell or if you need -- With any of these products as we look at it as absolutely have manufactures dealing with these products that end of life health and agree. To by a greener design and will have a better product overall at the end Thank you. Others raise your hands. Hi -- So this conversation has been focused on the individual consumer. Of as far as what we should do. What about -- Is a large usage of plastics a with AG every time I go past the fields and see that they're covered with plastic that our food is growing. In plastic. Of the medical waste industry is enormous. Of and electronics ayes something it is filled with plastic and we're not going to not use electronics. We're not gonna not buy. Foods that are grown in all this plastic but what's being done in our their figures comparing where -- That volume of waste such as AG medical industry and electronics with -- What consumers use safer takeout and plastic bags and? Bottles. Thanks action reaction is what what are you doing. About those more. What if your to me to be harder I don't know if they are larger not? Thank you yeah -- Good afternoon -- My name is Jeff Chester I'm representing Oceania Oceania is the largest conservation group -- Internationally that is what will focus specifically and exclusively on oceans ands and we're we're actually working on launching a global plastics -- Campaign -- And and actually Blake -- And I are here at the local level region both in -- Monterey as were based -- I also in the Monterey Bay charter school ocean garden -- Guardian coordinator -- Through the no -- National marine sanctuaries program where the school in in Monterey has actually made a three year commitment to go towards zero waste as a school -- And the kids are are extremely excited about it the kids get it right away and it's the parents we got to worry about -- Six are obviously a a huge problem for all the reasons people talk about I think we'd like to see kind of a an effort to move away from just the idea of disposable idea products in general -- Ends in -- Ultimately the the issue of of production and it had hit tackling not is is certainly the big -- One where we are we're in the U. K. or and the and the your and in Europe that they're now tackling it this problem in a comprehensive way rather than just looking at kind of one product at a time. They're doing a comprehensive -- Of solution or package that includes both in the phase outs of specific worst offender single use products as well as mandatory reductions and others as well as financial incentives to bring on more durables and reusable materials. And so you'll California has a history of doing comprehensive legislation like -- Assembly bill thirty two to address climate in legacy of California -- But so far the plastics work well we have made some aye thing major progress and emerge as a leader in some areas it has been too piecemeal and it is insufficient given the growth of the problem. And so we are are hoping to work -- And come together with various NGOs -- Very various businesses and hoping to see more of a coordinated effort in the California legislature to try to take a comprehensive approach to to these issues -- And and really didn't use the momentum that's building now to get more serious about this problem so thank you for keeping an eye on your agenda and we are we're here to help in this fight thank you very much. Hi good afternoon my class of environmental organization Californians against waste. For someone committee for having this hearing you've done a amazing job of keeping the drumbeat going both in the legislative action you've taken. This past year in the last few years and then having hearings and briefings and other things in Sacramento. I I think to to my to the point of my colleague from Oceania. We need to start looking at this comprehensively. We have a very big problem that seems intractable. And the way we handle these intractable problems is through comprehensive policies. And I it's more or less told the comments right I my mouth. But I think we as a society as a state need to start saying. We can't have an infinite growth and disposal plastics. We need to cap them out of classic we generate and reduce that over time. And you know it's it's the timing of this hearing. Is really appropriate -- Given that. Kind three major news stories in the past week -- One of the stories was about a week ago when they announced that they test the table salt. In 90% of the table salt they tested had micro plastic. A couple days ago there was ever a researcher that an ounce a the taste tested -- Stool samples and found 1100% of the stool samples. How plastic? Which might actually kind of be good news because at least a fleeting the system. And then the news today coming out of Europe is that they just adopted a comprehensive framework. To phase out the use of of single use products that have alternatives. And setting up a framework to reduce the ones that don't. And so I think there's a lot more work to do but it's it's a lot easier to do nothing and I commend you having this conversation and for keeping a dialogue going. Thank you. Good afternoon thank you so much for having this conference today my name is Rachel cap and I'm environmental projects coordinator for the city of what's involved. I've to comments about the trash provision first as my understanding of the trash provision how we are to quantify the water quality benefits of reducing trash that end up in a receiving waters. So it seems to me that something that we should really be focusing on are the types of persistent plastics that have chemicals that here to them. Or leach chemicals into our water such as cigarette* or agricultural plastics that carry the methyl bromide or other kinds of pollutants I'm out encourage that that be something that we look at as we go through our trash man that. Secondly I am now working on coordinating that at best management practices for our trash provision it kind of feels like throwing spaghetti at a wall and hoping that. Other departments and divisions within the city feel committed to our storm water program -- Primarily that has been a public works AB really heavy hitting area of so I would also encourage the state to think about ways to include our police or are parks and and make sure that we're looking at it and a city wide scale including enforcement. And code at enforcement is a huge issue in Watsonville and last but certainly not least I wanted to speak to the inclusivity of this movement. Specifically to any wall from reaching out to the disability community related to straws -- And to think about that with south county so. I'm a 100% on board with banning bottled water but we have people in our community who have come from places where you can't drink the water and so is to think of our community as being able to just immediately. Get rid of it you know we're not the community that's significantly a challenge for us so for us to really invite our whole community when we look at issues like these. And I really appreciate that thank you -- High -- My name's George on and chief scientist -- Edition its service to live here in Santa Cruz I want to pick up on what Jeff said -- Thank you mark for hosting this -- This panel this is critical. And energy Conservancy we worked worked on this issue for a number of years and a lot of beach cleanups but we've increasingly been focused on the question of waste management. And farther up the chain where the materials are coming from and it is absolutely critical to have the recycling industry in the room but the one group of folks that are not in this conversation right now are the producers of the materials the world talking about. At the end of the day the fundamental problem with plastics is it's not worth very much you see that coming through the recycling community it's the reason that it's easier to use plastic and glass or other things. And so we fundamentally have to get this question of the cost and the value of plastics and ultimately I think that brings us back to corporate responsibility an extended producer responsibility. And I think you'll be really great if we could figure out a re way to reset that conversation my understanding and I'm no expert. Is that has become very toxic in this country the responsibility in the context of plastics and ocean health would be really nice way to kind of reset the conversation. And figure out and really practical ways what is our shared responsibility and what is the private sector's responsibility here in solving this problem so I'd encourage you to go for to think about that way [inaudible] Thank you. Right no one else. Hey signal closing thoughts members. Well just getting back to the idea of cost and value you know earlier -- We heard the discussion about the cost municipalities of having to clean up. Through filtration -- The material that's going through their community through storm drains and streams. And yet that cost which is being paid for by taxpayers and ratepayers is not calculated when we talk about the cost to let's say business. And so re framing -- How we think of these I think is really important something that USCIS policy makers can maybe help? Figure out a way to do in right now Los Angeles is in the process of voting on measure W. which is a parcel tax for storm water clean out. And a lot of people say but I didn't because shin so -- There's a real inequity to how the costs -- It really are being borne by society you know particularly cities that -- A our coastal cities and have to pay a bigger burden of costs because they're the ones that are interacting with the ocean in a different way. So -- Trying to help -- Re adjust that and show those true cost like you were talking about because the amount of carbon coming out of trucks transporting glass but there's new data emerging about the amount of greenhouse gases that leak leak. Out of plastic bottles and that's never been calculated before so making sure that we have a really holistic -- View of the costs and that the costs are being -- Equitably dispersed -- And I think that the the manufacturing industry. They understand that where they're way ahead of us and that's why you see. Reactions to things like tethering bottle caps which would seem like such a no brainer to so many of us become huge bottles in Sacramento or a plastic bag ban or whatever else it is. So I I do think that it is -- Really -- An imperative of the legislature to try to get a better understanding of all of that. And it's great to see so many people being activated -- And I will say it's a lot easier for people in the coast who. Through education understand the issues but also see it in their backyards it's very different story if you're talking about going into other areas of the state that don't interact as much with the coastline. That I have their own economic that costs for them is a much higher percentage of their everyday lives so it hurts more. For them to deal with an issue that they see is very far away and remote. I don't understand so I I just put that out of some of the challenges that we all have to try to deal with when we put these policies forward and be very aware of I'm at the same time. As you so eloquently said we can't let that stop us because the survival of you know our planet is really at stake in that sounds very dramatic. But it's also true so -- I I do think that it's important to have these conversations and to try to kind of spread the message and I'm so glad to see National Geographic I just. Doing that I just wish more people actually read it -- But getting that message out there is something that California that when we bring these policies forward even if they fail we've started that conversation. You know having the conversation about straws made a lot of people start thing about structure ruling. And about plastic differently I bet you anything that the market for metal straws was instantly created you know which has its own. Of positive economic aside again shirt chair stone and McCarty for having this for allowing us to participate I've learned a lot today I want to thank all the panelists on that was so fast that I kept taking slides. And sending them off my poor legislative director -- But will be you know streaming this on all of our social media sites in trying to spread the word and I I really want to thank just the members of the public in the activists who do this you know out of passion and love -- Every single day because your work is I think starting to to turn the tide so thanks again. Thank you notice. There are yeah is one of the one at the moment thank you as chair stone Chen McCarty is as well as a colleague summer. Or Friedman -- And I really also want to thank the panelists I got a lot information today -- Of it's it's great to be able to do this we're not in session. Of only really have the time to let it -- To absorb the information think about it -- In and so it's a totally helpful and I think that -- You know when it comes. To quirk responsibility when it comes to what we can do is read as a legislature when it comes to consumer choice. I think that what we were that these kinds of conversations help to build a momentum. As alluded to but assembly Friedman with the apple plus extras in just having people talk about and then start making their own choices. Also adding the young people are gonna save us once again I think that you tend to see them. Carrying around water bottles much more and be more topple about this but we need to put in place. Of the environment -- To create that behavior change amongst all of us but especially our corporate partners that really needed. To step up and so I think that -- This is been very helpful for me and again to the chairs for organizing this. Sure yeah thank you again I that I know that this was an issue that -- We've been talking about in the natural resources policy committee legislation. Later plastic waste and recycling I think is important to have it together is certainly was in lightning. I to was -- Excited see the graduate students here they del. Went back to class -- Hopefully they'll be part of the solution -- Bringing some -- Remedies for us to to tackle -- Going forward and I I do think that there is a social consciousness going. Not not just dinner here in Santa Cruz but across California but even in areas that don't necessarily. See the beautiful coastline everyday to to know you know. My little -- Fourth grader a couple years ago to little project on on on on on on the impact of a plastic in the ocean into me to go to the store and buy. The six pack thinks for the plastic thing but on the beard that fix whatever Kansas so forth. And so she had a little turtle in her room and she put through their chance little. An eight year old thinking about these things and it's just -- It's very very powerful and I think it's important that we focus on the next generation because they're the ones that will be here. After us so -- Today give us -- Basically a stark reminder of what the issues are today in California across the globe but also. Some hope and some remedies from the local level -- That we can bring about through the rest of California so -- Look for to work with all you and future thank you. Thank you and just to briefly I think some of the synergies the comments that are there. The question really is the larger question so lot of the industrial agricultural are significant piece of it most of the thin film is is in fact agricultural and industrial. We just we had. Limited time but those are really also part of what the broader conversation is electronic disposal all of that a lot of local jurisdictions are taking on I think I would completely agree I think most of us agree. About this notion of extended produce responsibility. That's one of the reasons were holding these is. To broaden what we know bring more people into the conversation right now anything we do in the legislature that CPR is a two thirds vote. At mosa plastic stuff we can't even get. Forty one votes in our own house so our steps are dramatic and we need to engage more broadly engage with the industry gauge. Where we can to look for solutions that ultimately are implementable that's one of the reasons the legislature does smaller pieces because those? Are approachable as opposed to being of the something that is more comprehensive but ultimately those with the the answers we need to get to get to is a comprehensive conversation about. The broader cost societal cost economic cost of decisions that have been made and how we can support the economy but also protect the environment and every. Sector strata academy. Taking responsibility for its piece of a solution that ultimately is is the goal. But that's what these conversations lead to hopefully and I appreciate everybody coming out on a really beautiful day here in Santa Cruz tough duty I know. But I'll do it thank you all very much and we are adjourned
