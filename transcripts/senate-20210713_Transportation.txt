THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS. FIRST I'D LIKE TO START BY AGREEING TO THE AMENDMENT AS DISCUSSED IN SENATE ENERGY LAST WEEK. AND TO THOSE PROPOSED IN YOUR COMMITTEE TODAY. THESE AMENDMENTS FURTHER CLARIFIED THAT THE BILL DOES NOT MANDATE PO USED TO MAINTAIN PUBLICLY BUT PUBLIC CHARGERS THEY DON'T pCHARGES THEY MUST MAKE AVAILABLE AND MAKE A MINOR TECHNICAL CORRECTIONS TO THE BILL. I'D LIKE TO THINK THE CHEERS AND THE COMMITTEE STAFF AGAIN FOR THEIR WORK AND DEDICATION TO IMPROVING THE SPILL. AS WE HAVE SEEN DEMAND FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLES IS GROWING. WE HAVE SET STATEWIDE GOAL OF EIGHT MILLION EV'S BY TWENTY THIRD. IN ORDER TO SUPPORT OUR DRIVERS WILL NEED OVER ONE POINT TWO MILLION SHARED AND PRIVATE CHARGES TO ALL COME ONLINE. BUILD OUT OF THE V. CHARGERS IS OCCURRING IN MANY AREAS BUT WE ARE RELYING HEAVILY ON THE STATE'S ELECTRIC UTILITY OR I WILL USE. TO FILL THIS NEED. YOU MUST BE SURE THAT PEER USER FILLING THE GAP IN THEIR TERRITORIES AS WELL AS A SERVER A THIRD OF OUR STATE'S ELECTRIC CUSTOMERS. THIS WILL WILL DO JUST THAT BY REQUIRING ALL PEOPLE USE TO ENSURE PUBLIC CHARGING IS AVAILABLE IN THEIR TERRITORIES. AND IT GIVES THEM FULL LATITUDE ON HOW THEY MAKE THAT HAPPEN INCLUDING CHARGING CUSTOMERS FOR THE SERVICE OR WORKING WITH PRIVATE INDUSTRY TO FILL THE NEED. BECAUSE OF THE AMENDMENTS THERE IS NO OPPOSITION TO THIS BILLAND IT IS MY REQUEST OF THE MEMBERS WHEN I VOTE ON EIGHTY. SIX FORTY ONE. THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER AND WE HAVE- THE BILL MOVED BY SENATOR MCCASKEY I'M AT THIS TIME WE'LL TAKE YOUR LEAD WITNESS AND SUPPORT WE HAVE SCOTT WATCHED FROM THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF ELECTRICAL WORKERS HE'S HERE IN PERSON MR WATCH THE RED HEAD. GOOD MORNING- MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS GOT WHICH SHOULD BE AT THE STATE ASSOCIATION OF ELECTRICAL WORKERS. AS YOU KNOW EMISSIONS COMES FROM THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR- THIS LEGISLATURE HAS DONE AN ADMIRABLE JOB OF DIRECTING THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES. TO INVEST IN BUILDING. EVE YOU CHARGING STATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE ACROSS OUR ENTIRE SERVICE TERRITORY UNFORTUNATELY. THAT IS NOT THE CASE WITH MANY OF THE PUBLICLY OWNED UTILITIES. AND THE PRIVATE SECTOR PARTICULARLY IGNORES COMMUNITIES THAT ARE ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED IN AND ARE PREDOMINANTLY LOW INCOME. SO IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT WE DO NOT HAVE COMMUNITIES LEFT BEHIND. WE BELIEVE THAT EIGHTY SIX FORTY ONE IS ESSENTIAL TO ENSURE THAT ALL CALIFORNIANS HAVE ACCESS TO CLEAN ENERGY VEHICLES SO WE WOULD URGE YOU KNOW I'VE THANK YOU.

OKAY THAT'S OKAY OKAY WONDERFUL WE'RE GONNA GO AHEAD AND TAKE UP A FILE ITEM NUMBER THREE THAT IS AT FORTY THREE- AND OUR CHIEF CONSULTANT WILL BE PASSING OUT THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE ACCEPTED- SO ASSEMBLYWOMAN IF YOU'D LIKE TO GO AHEAD. THANK YOU THE CHAIR CHAIRWOMAN GONZALEZ AND MEMBERS OF FIRST I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND YOUR STAFF FOR YOUR WORK ON THIS BILL IN YOUR ASSISTANCE AND HELP- WE ARE GOING TO BE RUDE ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS AS OTLINED ON PAGES SIX AND SEVEN INCLUDING REMOVING THE SECTION RELATING TO SCHOOL ZONES. I ALSO WANT TO THANK OUR TRIPLE A FOR WORKING WITH OUR OFFICE SINCE MARCH ON TIGHTENING THE DEFINITIONS IN THE BILL TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T HAVE ANY UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. THE GOAL OF THIS BILL IS SIMPLY TO HELP CITIES HAVE MORE FLEXIBILITY WHEN THEY SET SPEEDLIMITS IN ORDER TO SAVE LIVES AND A CENTER TRAFFIC SAFETY RATHER THAN SPEED AS THE PRIMARY GOAL OF OUR SPEED LIMITS AND OF OUR ROADS. SO HOW DID THIS COME ABOUT SO I REPLIED WE USED TO BE ON THE CITY COUNCIL THE CITY OF GLENDALE WHICH IS A CITY THAT LIKE MANY OF OUR CITIES IN THE STATE HAS A TRAFFIC SAFETY PROBLEM WE HAVE AN UNUSUALLY HIGH AMOUNT OF PEDESTRIAN DEATHS EVERY SINGLE YEAR AND THE CITY HAS MADE TRAFFIC SAFETY A HIGH PRIORITY IN THE CITY FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS. INSTITUTING TRAFFIC CALMING MEASURES WORKING WITH THE PUBLIC DOING EDUCATION BUT ONE THING IS REALLY FRUSTRATED OR CITY WHICH IS BEING CONSTANTLY FORCED TO RAISE SPEED LIMITS TO ACCOMMODATE SPEEDING DRIVERS EVEN AS WE'RE TRYING TO PRIORITIZE ROAD SAFETY. AND THIS IS BECAUSE CALIFORNIA USES- A SYSTEM CALLED THE EIGHTY FIFTH PERCENTILE THAT FORCES CITIES TO THAT IN ORDER TO ENFORCE SPEED LIMITS THEY MUST HAVE THE SPEED LIMITS WITHIN THE EIGHTY FIFTH PERCENTILE OF HOW FAST DRIVERS ARE GOING. NOW IN THE AGE OF BOTH ONLINE- TELEPHONE APPS LIKE WAZE AND GOOGLE MAPS YOU HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE DRIVING THROUGH. NEIGHBORHOODS THAT THEY'RE UNFAMILIAR WITH. TRYING TO GET TO AND WORK OFTEN SEE. THROUGH THE NEIGHBORHOOD. WE ALSO HAVE A SITUATION WHERE CARS BECAUSE OF THE DESIGN IMPROVEMENTS OVER THE YEARS. MAKE IT EASIER FOR PEOPLE TO SPEAK WITHOUT FEELING LIKE THEY'RE GOING FAST YOU CAN GO VERY VERY FAST IN TODAY'S MODERN CARS AND HAVE ALMOST NO ROAD NOISE NO SENSE OF MOTION AND THIS ALSO ENCOURAGES PEOPLE FRANKLY TO SPEED. SO THE EIGHTY FIFTH PERCENTILE IT'S BEEN SOMETHING THAT'S VERY FRUSTRATING FOR ALL OF OUR CITIES WHICH IS WHY WE HAVE A HUGE. ROLL CALL OF CITIES WHO ARE SUPPORTING THIS BILL AND A TRAFFIC SAFETY GROUPS THAT ARE SUPPORTING THIS BILL. BECAUSE EVERY FEW MILES AN HOUR FASTER THAN A CAR GOES ALMOST EXPONENTIALLY INCREASES THE CHANCE OF SERIOUS INJURY OR DEATH FOR PEDESTRIAN WHO'S HIT BY THAT CAR. QUITE SIMPLY SPEED KILLS AND OUR CITIES NEED BETTER TOOLS SO THIS BILL. ARE WE OF MANY PEOPLE IN THE PAST IN THIS LEGISLATURE INTRODUCED BILLS TRYING TO DEAL WITH THE EIGHTY FIFTH PERCENTILE IN BIG REWRITE RARELY EVER SUCCEEDED. WE DID THE SAME THING TWO YEARS AGO AND TRIED TO DO A BILL REFORMING THE EIGHTY FIFTH PERCENTILE. THE FORMER CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE- IN THE ASSEMBLY SIDE- ASKED US INSTEAD OF INTRODUCING THE BILL TO FORM A TASK FORCE TO BRING ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS TOGETHER FOR THE FIRST TIME. TO DISCUSS THE EIGHTY FIFTH PERCENTILE AND HOW SPEED LIMITS RELATE TO TRAFFIC SAFETY. SO FOR THE AND IT WAS A REALLY WISE THING TO DO BECAUSE FOR THE FIRST TIME WE HAD A GROUP MADE UP OF FORMER OPPONENTS OF CHANGING THE POLICY. OF LAW ENFORCEMENT OF ROAD SAFETY ADVOCATES. OF JUST A WHOLE EVERY SINGLE TYPE OF STAKEHOLDER WAS INVOLVED IN THIS WORKING RIBBON THEY WORK FOR AN ENTIRE YEAR LOOKING AT ALL OF THE DATA FROM AROUND THE COUNTRY ON SPEED LIMIT SETTING. ON ROAD SAFETY. AND CAME UP WITH A LIST OF RECOMMENDATIONS. THAT ALSO ADDRESS PEOPLE'S CONCERNS. AND THIS BILL IS THE RESULT OF THAT VERY HARD WORK FROM MANY STAKEHOLDERS FROM ACROSS THE STATE FROM RURAL AREAS TO URBAN AREAS. ONLY FROM JOB VERY REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLE OF STAKE HOLDERS INCLUDING TRIPLE WAY. WHO WAS A WONDERFUL- ADVOCATE TO WORK WITH. THIS SO THIS BILL REALLY DOES WORK TO GIVE CITIES THE TOOLS IN THE RIGHT LOCATIONS UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES. TO NOT BE FORCED TO CONTINUALLY RAISE SPEED LIMITS AND IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES TO BE ABLE TO LOWER SPEED LIMITS BASED ON THINGS LIKE ACCIDENT DATA. AND VULNERABLE POPULATIONS IT'S A MODEST REFORM BUT ONE THAT'S VERY VERY MEANINGFUL. AND I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING A DISCUSSION AND I WOULD URGE AND I'VE- TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU ASSEMBLYWOMAN. OKAY IN SUPPORT YOU HAVE A- TWO PEOPLE THAT ARE LEAD TESTIMONY OF WITNESSES- YOU'VE GT TO DARNELL GROUPS BE. HARDER NOW KRISPY TRANSFORMING THE COASTLINE MODERATOR CAN YOU ENSURE THAT MR CHRISTIE IS ON THE LINE. GOOD MORNING- NAME ETERNAL GREAT BE EXPECTED DIRECTOR TRANSFORM. CAN ACCOUNT FOR NEARLY A THIRD OF ALL PRACTICALITY. EIGHTY FORTY THREE OF THE COMMENTS AND RULE THAT WILL ALLOW TRAFFIC ENGINEER COULD DRESS HI INJURY AND CRASH COURT OR BY LOWERING THE SPEED LIMIT. IT ALSO KEEP ANYTHING FROM BEING REQUIRED TO INCREASE THE LIMIT IN HIGH SPEED AND HIGH END RECORD OR- A TARGETED APPROACH AGAINST CITY THE FLEXIBILITY THEY NEED TO ADDRESS THEIR MOST DANGEROUS QUARTERS. COUNTRY DISCONNECTING THIS BE LIMITED JUDGMENTS ARE NOT ARBITRARY THEIR RESPONSE TO THE HIGH NUMBER. OF TRAFFIC FATALITIES AND INJURIES. WHERE YOU CAN BE LIMITED BY JUST BY HEALTHY HOUR. REDO INJURY BETWEEN EIGHT AND FIFTEEN. WELL TRY TO CALL ME IS IMPORTANT PART OF A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO KEEPING OUR STREETS SAFE. THAT TAKES TIME AND MONEY CURRENT LAW COURSES THAT YOU CAN CHOOSE BETWEEN STREET FEST YOU FAST AND A STREET THAT IS UNENFORCEABLE. THIS IS WHY WE KNOW THAT THIS IS A BOTH. A MEASURE OF COURAGE AND FAITH. BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH THE ECONOMIC TRAVEL WE'RE DOWN THIRTEEN POINT 2% NATIONWIDE. WITHOUT TRAFFIC SO IT GO UP THERE AND THE LARGEST INCREASES WERE IN THE BLACK COMMUNITY. WHERE THERE WERE 23% COMPARED TO SEVEN POINT 2% OVERALL. UNDER TWENTY NINETEEN GAINERS BY THE DINING COURT SMART WITH AMERICA FOUND THAT BLACK PEOPLE ARE ALMOST 50% MORE LIKELY THAN WHITE PEOPLE TO BE STRUCK AND KILLED BY DRIVER WHILE WALKING AND DISPARITY FOR INDIGENOUS PEOPLE LOOK UP TO THREE TIMES THAT HIGH. WHAT WE CAN STUDY FOUND THIRTY FIVE PERCENT. OF THE NATION'S MOST DANGEROUS ROADWAYS PEDESTRIAN BORDER LOW INCOME NEIGHBORHOODS. WHEN UCLA STUDY SHOWED THAT BLACK PEOPLE FACE DISPROPORTIONATE SAFETY OUTCOMES AND ALL TRANSPORTATION MODES PROFESSIONAL WALKING. BLACKENED COLLISION VICTIMS ARE MOST LIKELY TO HAVE BEEN KILLED AND LEAST LIKELY TO SURVIVE WITH NO INJURIES. CONVICTIONS THE OTHER RACIAL GROUPS IT REQUIRES SUPPORT THIS COMMONSENSE PUBLIC SAFETY MEASURE OPPOSED TO ENHANCE THE LOCAL COMMUNITY. AND WE BRING SAFETY TO ALL OF US THANK YOU. THANK YOU MR CRISPY OUR NEXT WE HAVE SELENA REYNOLDS FROM THE LA DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION SHE ALSO WAS ON THE CO HOST LINE MS REYNOLDS. GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN GONZALEZ MEMBERS THE LEADE REYNOLDS GENERAL MANAGER OF THE LOS ANGELES DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION SPEAKING IN STRONG SUPPORT OF EIGHTY FORTY THREE. DRIVERS KILLED NEARLY FOUR THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS CRASHES EVERY YEAR THREE TIMES THAT AMOUNT OR SEVERELY INJURED AND THE GOOD DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECT THE MOST VULNERABLE AMONG. CHILDREN OLDER ADULTS AND PEOPLE WALKING IN LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES OF COLOR FOR EXAMPLE IN LOS ANGELES DURING THE PANDEMIC TRAFFIC GOING TO GREECE AND SEVERE CRASHES WENT DOWN EXCEPT IN THE PREDOMINANTLY BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITY OF SOUTH LA. WHAT WAS NOT TRAFFIC VIOLENCE GROW BY TWENTY THREE PERCENT. KILLED AND ROBBED OF THE QUALITY OF LIFE. B. DETERMINES THE SEVERITY OF THE CRASH TO FIVE MILES AN HOUR CAN MEAN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH. THE CALIFORNIA WE DON'T LET PEOPLE TEXT AND DRIVE BECAUSE THE TRACTOR DRIVING SKILLS. WE DON'T ALLOW. DRINKING AND DRIVING BECAUSE DRUNK DRIVING. WE SAY WE DON'T LET THE TO BE. PUT UNDER CURRENT LAW IF ENOUGH DRIVERS. EXCEEDS LIMITS WE INCREASE THEM. IT DOES NOT MAKE SENSE SPEED LIMITS MUST BE SET TO BRING DRIVER BEHAVIOR IN LINE WITH THE PEOPLE. ROADWAY CONDITIONS AND THE LAW. CURRENT LAN IS FORCED ME TO RAISE THE LIMIT ON NEARLY TWO HUNDRED MILES OF STREETS OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS. JUST LAST WEEK I HAD TO RAISE THE SPEED LIMIT WHERE A MOTHER OF TWO WITH KILLED BY SPEEDING DRIVER. AFTER THE STREET BECAME UNENFORCEABLE AND DRIVERS CONTINUED SPEEDING RECKLESSLY UNITY. THE STATUS QUO IS NOT STAGNANT IT GIVES LICENSE TO LIFE THREATENING BEHAVIOR. THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES AIMS TO SORT OF BE THE SAVE LIVES MURDERED HEARING SOLUTIONS. IT'LL TAKE TIME AND MONEY TO BUILD. AS WE WORK TO IMPROVE OUR. SEVENTY FIVE HUNDRED MILE STREETS AND ALLEYS. SPEED LIMITS WILL CONTAIN TO RISE. AND MORE PEOPLE WILL. IF WE DON'T ACT NOW. AT FORTY THREE WITH AN END TO SENSELESS SPEED LIMIT INCREASES IT PROTECTS OUR MOST VULNERABLE. GIVE CITIES A BETTER WAY TO SET SAFETY LIMITS ARGUABLY STREETS AROUND SCHOOLS AND SENIOR CNTERS. AND COMMERCIAL AREAS WHERE MORE PEOPLE WALKING CONGREGATE. AB FORTY THREE WILL SAVE LIVES AND I URGE YOU YES. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTRIALS SO WE'VE CONCLUDED THE LEAD WITNESSES IN SUPPORT A MODERATOR TO HAVE ANYONE ELSE ON THE LINE IN SUPPORT. OF AB. FORTY THREE.

BIEBER SAFE STREETS LOS ANGELES- WHO IS ON THE COAST LINE MODERATOR CAN YOU ENSURE MR BEEPERS ON THE LINE. WHAT VEHICLE. I'M ON THE LINE. GREEK GO RIGHT AHEAD THANK YOU MISTER BEAVER. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE JV FOR EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR STEVE FOR ST LA REPRESENTING THE INTERESTS OF. CALIFORNIA'S TWENTY SEVEN MILLION LICENSED DRIVERS I AM ALSO SERVED AS A MEMBER OF THE ZERO FATALITIES TASK FORCE. MAYBE FORTY THREE WHILE WELL INTENDED SUFFERS FROM A FUNDAMENTAL ERROR OF COMPLETING LOWER SPEED LIMITS WITH LOWER SPEED. THE CASE OF EXPERIENCE IN RESEARCH INCLUDING STUDIES FROM THE FEDERAL HIGHWAY ADMINISTRATION SHOW. THAT LOWERING OR RAISING SPEED LIMITS HAS LITTLE TO NO EFFECT ON DRIVERS SPEEDS. EVEN THE REPORT BY THE EUROPEAN TALLAHASSEE FORCE CONCEDES THAT THE MOTION EXPECTED ABOUT A ONE TO TWO MILE PER HOUR CHANGING SPEEDS. AND EVEN THAT OVERSTATES THE EFFECT DARBUS BEACH MATCH THE WAY THE GOVERNMENT BUILT THE ROADWAY NOT THE NUMBER ON THE SIGN. SPEED LIMIT SET MORE THAN FIVE MILES AN HOUR DIFFERENCE FROM THIS DESIGN SPEED AS MEASURED BY SPEED SURVEY CAN BE DANGEROUS CAUSING INCREASE SPEED VARIATION WHICH LEADS TO INCREASED COLLISIONS. FURTHER FORCING DRIVERS TO HYPER FOCUS ON MAINTAINING AN UNCOMFORTABLE SPEED NOT ALIGNED WITH THE ROADWAY GEOMETRY BECAUSE INCREASED DRIVER'S DISTRACTION AND MORE DANGER FOR PEDESTRIANS AND BICYCLISTS. BLOWING AS BEING WITH IS NOT LOWER SPEED SIMPLY LOWERED THE BAR TO ENFORCEMENT MAKING VIOLATORS OUT OF THE VAST MAJORITY OF DRIVERS. SPEED LIMITS ARE SUPPOSED TO INDICATE WHO THE OUT LIARS ARE BUT WHEN THE SPEED LIMIT BY DEFINITION MAKES FIFTY SIXTY OR EVEN 80% OF DRIVERS OF THE VIOLATORS. THAT'S THE ONLY BECOMES MEANINGLESS ENDANGERED ENGENDERING DISRESPECT FROM THE MOTORING PUBLIC AND MAKING THE JOB OF THE POLICE MUCH MORE DIFFICULT. THANK YOU FOR CALLING THE POLICE TO ENFORCE UNREALISTICALLY LOW SPEED LIMITS OF ROADS THE TRUST BETWEEN GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND THE PUBLIC AT A TIME WHEN THE TRUST WHEN I TRUST HIS INSTRUCTIONS AND OUR SOCIETY CAN LITTLE AFFORD TO FURTHER DAMAGE TO. THIS FRAGILE RELATIONSHIP. IN CONCLUSION THAT WE CURRENTLY REMAIN IN OPPOSITION WE WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR AGREEING TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE'S PROPOSED AMENDMENTS INTENDED TO RESTRICT THE ABILITY TO REDUCE SPEED LIMITS AND TO NO MORE THAN TEN MILES PER HOUR BELOW THE MEASURED OPERATING SPEED. HOWEVER AN AMBIGUITY EXISTS TO SECTION SEVEN OF THE BILL WHICH MAY ALLOW GREATER VARIATION IN THE FORMAT. MILE PER HOUR REDUCTION UNFORTUNATELY AS OF THE TIME THIS HEARING WE DO NOT YET HAVE A COMMITMENT THE AUTHOR'S OFFICE THAT THE TEXT OPINION MATTERS WILL CLARIFY THIS AMBIGUITY WE THEREFORE TO MINIMUM ARE ASKING FOR THIS COMMITMENT. PRIOR TO PASSING THIS BILL OUT OF COMMITTEE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MR. WE APPRECIATE YOUR TIME. AS WELL- SO ANY. OTHER WITNESSES AND AN OPPOSITION TO AB. THREE ON THE LINE MODERATOR PLEASE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR LADIES AND GENTLEMEN IF YOU WISH TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION OF EIGHTY FORTY THREE YOU MAY PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME. IN ONE MOMENT WELL WE GOT TO THE LINE NUMBERS. ONE SIXTY FOR YOUR LINE IS OPEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. GOOD MORNING CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS THE LONGER ON BEHALF OF THE ACLU HELLO ACTIONS BY THAT DATE THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT COMMENT THE ONE. AT NINE FIFTY ONE POINT NINE IS OPEN TO. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING AMANDA BOTHERING WITH TRIPLE A LEGITIMATE A POSITION OF OPPOSING WITH THE MAN I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR HER STAFF AND HER STAFF FOR WORKING WITH US ON THE CELL. WITH THE AMENDMENTS TAKEN IN COMMITTEE AMANDA ARE. TRIPLE A WILL MOVE TO A POSITION OF NEUTRAL ON EIGHTY FORTY THREE THANK YOU. THERE ARE NO FURTHER COMMENTS THANK YOU OKAY THANK YOU MODERATOR- WE'VE CONCLUDED THE OPPOSITION- ON THE CONFERENCE LINE IS THERE ANYONE IN THE GALLERY IN OPPOSITION. C. NINE IN ROOM ONE TWELVE. EIGHTY NINE OKAY WE'LL TAKE THIS BACK TO MEMBERS FOR DISCUSSION SENATOR RUBIO. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- I REALLY DO THINK THIS IS A REALLY GOOD FELL ON NOT ONLY WILL I SUPPORT IT BUT I ALSO WANT TO BE A CO AUTHOR- YOU KNOW AND I DO APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT WAS DONE BY THE ZERO FATALITY TASK FORCE- I BELIEVE THIS BILL COMPLEMENTS. ANOTHER BILL THAT I THAT I HAVE WHICH IS SB SEVEN THIRTY FIVE WHICH ATTEMPTS TO REDUCE SPEEDS AROUND. SCHOOL ZONES AS A SCHOOL TEACHER FOR SEVENTEEN YEARS AND VICE PRINCIPAL. YOU KNOW I KEEP SHARING HOW I SAW SO MANY NEAR MISSES AND ONE CHILD IN PARTICULAR GET STRUCK AND IT'S ALWAYS UNFORTUNATE SO. WE DO NEED TO TRY AND MAKE STREETS SAFER FOR KIDS AND OUR COMMUNITY- I DO APPRECIATE THAT CITIES HAVE DISCRETION BASED ON. AND I BELIEVE THE AUTHOR SAID IT YOU KNOW THE RIGHT LOCATION AND UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES AND I DO BELIEVE THAT'S IMPORTANT FOR EACH CITY TO. TO REALLY ASSESS THEIR OWN COMMUNITY AND SEE WHERE THEY NEED S. I ALSO THINK THAT THAT THIS IS A MODEST APPROACH- YOU KNOW ANYTHING THAT WE CAN DO FOR OUR FAMILIES TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE SAFE I THINK IT'S ALWAYS A GOOD THING. I AM WE ALSO HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE WE LIVE SO FAR IN TERMS OF LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND STATES TRYING TO GET. PEOPLE OFF THE ROAD AND DRIVE I MEAN I'M SORRY RIDING BIKES AND WE EVEN. DESIGNED ROADS NOW MORE FRIENDLY TO TWO BIKES WHICH WE DIDN'T HAVE IN THE PAST AND WE ALSO HAVE TO. TAKE THAT INTO CONSIDERATION THAT THERE IS A LOT MORE PEOPLE BIKING AND WALKING AND THAT WAS OUR GOAL RIGHT TO GET PEOPLE OFF CAR SO I THINK THIS IS REALLY. JUST A GOOD APPROACH TO TRYING AND BE SAFE SO WITH THAT I WANT TO MOVE THE BILL THANK YOU THANK. YOU SENATOR RUBIO SENATOR AKOWSKI. I THINK MATT. MADAM I HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE AUTHOR. OF ON SOME OF THE POINTS THAT WERE RAISED BY THE- OPPOSITION IN PARTICULAR I'M READING- SECTION SEVEN. OF THE BILL ON PAGE NINE. AND I THINK WHAT THEY'RE- LOOKING AT IS IT STARTS AT. FIVE POINT NINETEEN. WHERE IT TAKES THE SPEED LIMIT NEEDS TO BE ROUNDED UP TO THE HIGHEST THE NEAREST FIVE MILES PER HOUR INCREMENTS BUT THE EIGHTY FIVE. EIGHTY FIFTH PERCENTILE SPEED. THE DEPARTMENT TRANSPORTATION A LOCAL AUTHORITY MAY DECIDE INSTEAD TO. ROUND DOWN THE SPEED LIMIT. TO THE LOWER FIVE MILES. PER HOUR INCREMENTS SO. I'M WONDERING. IF THIS POSTED SPEED LIMIT IS- THIRTY. N. N. THIS SPEED THEY DO THE TESTS AND EIGHTY FIFTEEN ECHOES. I UNDERSTAND. THIRTY TWO POINT NINE IS BELOW OR THIRTY TWO POINT FOUR IS BELOW THIRTY TWO AND A HALF SO THAT WOULD ROUND DOWN BUT IF IT GOES TO THIRTY FOUR OR THIRTY FIVE. WITH THIRTY FOUR POINT NINE NINE NINE. THE SAD. GIVE CALTRANS ANY TORY THIS STAY AT THE THIRTY RATHER THAN GOING TO THE- THIRTY FIVE. THAT QUESTION THE SENSE TO. I DIDN'T KNOW THAT THEY WERE B. MATH AS PART OF THIS QUIZ BUT I WILL DO MY BEST SO ARE YOU'RE ASKING UNDER OUR BILL OR UNDER THE CAR UNDER CURRENT LAW YOU'RE SO YOU'RE SAYING UNDER OUR BILL AND YOUR BILL WOULD GIVE THEM THE OPTION NOW OF STAYING AT THAT ORIGINAL SPEED LIMIT. OKAY SO IT'S MY UNDERSTAND IS LONG AS IT DOESN'T GO OVER THIRTY FIVE IT DOESN'T INCLUDE A FULL FIVE MILES RIGHT AND ACTUALLY AN ORIGINAL INCARNATION OF THE BILL DID GIVE THEM MORE FLEXIBILITY TO LOWER IT EVEN MORE. BUT BUT BASED ON CONCERNS WE MADE THAT. A LOT MORE YOU KNOW WE COMPROMISE AND MADE IT TO WHERE IT WASN'T AS LARGE OF A SWING. IN THE STAFF REPORT TO SAY GOOD JOB ABOUT TALKING THE CHALLENGE THAT WE HAVE ON LOWERING SPEED LIMITS- WE'RE AS THE OPPOSITION IN THE CRATE INDICATED THAT THERE'S NOW YOU COULD HAVE 6070% OF THE PEOPLE THAT MAYBE OUT LIARS. BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT THE STREETS DESIGNED- AND THAT WOULD CREATE THE STAFF REPORTS PARTS OUT MORE- PAST DISPARITY BETWEEN HOW FAST PEOPLE ARE DRIVING BECAUSE SOMEBODY'S GOING TWENTY MILES AN HOUR IN SOMEBODY'S GOING FORTY IN THE STREETS DESIGNED TO GO FORTY FIVE- CAN YOU ADRESS THAT CONCERN THAT THE OPPOSITION HAS. RAISED THAT WE MAY ACTUALLY INCREASE DISPARITY BECAUSE THE POSTED SIGN MAY BE- SIX IT IS SIGNIFICANTLY BELOW WHAT THE STREET DESIGN WAS AND WHAT THE DATA POINTS OUT OF HOW THE AVERAGE DRIVER DRIVES ALONG THE STREET SO I HAVE LOOKED AT SOME OF THE DATA THAT SUGGESTED THAT I ACTUALLY DON'T FIND IT VERY COMPELLING. THE IDEA THAT IF YOU HAVE A SPEED LIMIT THAT'S TWENTY FIVE MILES AN HOU AND PEOPLE FEEL COMFORTABLE GOING THIRTEEN YOU'VE GOT SOME GOING FORTY FIVE MEANS THAT YOU'RE GOING TO SOMEHOW COME OVER HERE AND SOMEONE ELSE. OR THEY'RE GOING AT SUCH DIFFERENT SPEEDS THAT CAUSES ACCIDENTS I PERSONALLY DON'T THINK IS REALLY BORN OUT IN THE DATA I- AND I THINK IT CERTAINLY WOULD BE IN A MUCH MORE EXTREME SITUATION SOMEBODY GOING THIRTY FIVE MILES AN HOUR FREEWAY WITH THE- SPEED LIMIT IS SIXTY FIVE MILES AN HOUR COULD INDEED POSE A DANGER. BUT ON CITY SREETS THAT ARE NORMALLY TWENTY FIVE THIRTY THIRTY FIVE MILES AN HOUR I JUST DON'T SEE THAT DISCREPANCY YOU KNOW WE'RE TALKING. A LOT OF AREAS THAT ARE HEAVILY POPULATED WHERE WOULD THIS PARTICULAR- SPEED LIMIT CHANGE WOULD AFFECT YOU KNOW THE BILL IS LIMITED TO BUSINESS DISTRICT IT'S LIMITED TO AREAS THAT ARE HIGH INJURY ALREADY IT'S LIMITED TO AREAS WHERE THERE'S A LOT OF PEDESTRIANS OR CYCLISTS. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE THESE HUGE VARIATIONS IN SPEED SORT OF PROGRAMMED INTO THOSE ROADS I CAN CERTAINLY SEE THAT IF ALL OF A SUDDEN OF A SECTION OF HIGHWAY WITH A SPEED LIMIT CHANGES. BUT I DON'T THINK THAT THOSE CONDITIONS EXIST WHERE THIS BILL. TAKES EFFECT. MA'AM I THE BECAUSE- I THINK I UNDERSTAND WHAT THE- WHAT THE- ADVOCATES AND THE AUTHOR IS GETTING AT IS THAT THIS IS A- RATHER THAN CHANGING THE STREET SCAPE. INDUSTRY ENGINEERING. I KNOW I COME FROM FREMONT. IT WAS DESIGNED. WITH THE IDEA THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO FREEWAYS AND THERE ARE PLENTY OF STREETS. WHERE YOU HAVE. FOUR LIGHTS AND YOU HAVE A- RIGHT HAND TURN LANE THAT YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO SLOW DOWN YOU CAN GO AT FORTY FIVE MILES AN HOUR BECAUSE- THEY WERE EXPECTING PEOPLE BE WHISTLING OFF. ONE FREEWAY TO GET TO THE OTHER SO. THAT'S WHAT THE BUILD COMMUNITY IS IN THE STAFF REPORT. SEEMS TO POINT OUT THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR. IN DETERMINING C. US. SPEED IS THE ST ENGINEERING AND WE HAVE A- OUR PREVIOUS CHAIR. HAS AUTHORED A BILL THAT IS GOT A BOAT LOAD OF MONEY THAT'S GOING INTO LOCAL. DISTRICTS RIGHT NOW AND THERE'S A LOT OF. BIKE LANES AND A LOT OF TRAFFIC CALMING THAT'S GOING ON- THAT'S- THAT'S CHANGING THAT STREETSCAPE THAT'S GOING TO. TO GET THE SAME RESULTS I THINK THAT THE AUTHORS TRYING TO GET TO. THE CHALLENGES THAT I'M HAVING IS THAT. THOUGH WHICH COMES FIRST THE APPLE OR THE- CHICKEN OR THE EGG DO WE CHANGE THE STREET SCAPE AND THEN REDUCE THE SPEEDS. ARE REDUCED TO SPEEDS. N. SITE PEOPLE AND- CREATE HIS DISPARITY SO THAT'S THAT'S- WHAT MY CONCERN IS IT'S NOT. IT'S NOT TRYING TO REDUCE THE THIRD OF THE DEATHS THAT OCCUR BY TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS RESULT OF SPEED. BECAUSE TWO THIRDS. ARE NOT BY SPEED SO WE GOT TO DEAL WITH THAT- WHAT HAS GIVEN ME- WE SPOKE WITH MANY AGENCIES. THE COMMITTEE MYSELF DIRECTLY- SPEAKING WITH MANY AGENCIES ONE IN PARTICULAR BAY AREA TRANSIT LOS ANGELES DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION. ARE OF COURSE NEED THE SOLUTION SO I THINK YOUR POINT WHAT THEY'RE LOOKING TO DO NOW AFTER THIS BILL IF IT SHOULD PASS A MOVE THROUGH AND BE SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR. IS TO CREATE NEW STREETSCAPE IN. NEW ENGINEERING AND DESIGNS AND PLANS. IN THEIR LOCAL. AND THAT'S WHAT THEY COMMITTED TO A SPA FOR PLACES LIKE SOUTH LOS ANGELES IT HAS SEEN. AN INCREASE IN FATALITIES- THAT DEFINITELY NEEDS THAT THE SPEEDS LOWERED WITH THE COMP AND THEN TO COMPLEMENT THE- THE- THE CHANGE IN ENGINEERING AND STREETSCAPE. THOUGH MORE BOLD- YOU KNOW MORE STREET BALTIMORE- EITHER YOU KNOW INFRASTRUCTURE CHANGES THAT WOULD HELP- EVEN FURTHER REDUCED SPEEDS IN AREAS THAT. MAYBE WERE INTENDED IT HISTORICALLY TO BE YOU KNOW FASTER SORT OF AREAS AROUND THREE WAYS IN WHICH ONE OF THEM ONE OF WHICH I LIVE. I THINK IT REALLY OKAY I THINK WE ALL HAVE THAT IN OUR DISTRICT RIGHT THANK YOU FOR THAT CLARIFICATION OF COURSE AND THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION AS SENATOR BECKER. THANK YOU. I THINK THE AUTHOR OF I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL I HAD A QUESTION AROUND. YOU IN GENERAL WE TRY TO. IF POSSIBLE DECREASE IN REACTION TO PEOPLE OF COLOR WITH PUBLIC SAFETY AND I'M JUST. HOW DO YOU THINK ABOUT THIS BILL IN TERMS OF- THE TEND TO BE HIGHER POLICE PRESENCE IN TERMS IN LOW INCOME NEIGHBORHOODS AND HOW THEY CAN ACTUALLY INCREASE INTERACTION AND- AND- MAYBE INCREASE FINDS AN INCREASE- YOU KNOW ROUTE RESULTING. SITUATIONS WITH PEOPLE OF COLOR HOW DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT IN THE CONTEXT OF THIS BILL. CHECK THE QUESTION AND THAT'S CERTAINLY THE CONCERN THAT THE ACLU I THINK WAS WAS VOICING. SO RIGHT NOW ON ANY GIVEN DAY WE ASSUME THAT ABOUT 15% OF PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY SPEEDING- THEY MAY NOT BE AGREE JUST A SPEEDING BUT THEY'RE SPENDING ENOUGH TO GET PULLED OVER BY LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND YET 50% OF PEOPLE DON'T GET PULLED OVER EVERY DAY- SO. IT MEANS TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU KNOW THIS WOULD INCREASE TICKETING REALLY THEY'RE GIVING TICKETS LEFT AND- POLICE OFFICERS HAVE ENOUGH PEOPLE TO TAKE IT- IT'S NOT GOING TO GIVE THEM SORT OF MORE PEOPLE BUT IT DOES. ALLOW FOR SIGNAL TO BE SENT- SO. I THINK FIRST OF ALL OUR PROBLEMS REALLY WITH THE FEE STRUCTURE THAT WE HAVE ON TRAFFIC TICKETS WHICH ARE VERY PUNITIVE IN VERY HIGH. AND DEFINITELY DISPROPORTIONATELY. HURT PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO PAY THOSE TICKETS AND THAT'S FOR ALL TRAFFIC INFRACTIONS ACROSS THE BOARD. AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD LOOK AT SEPARATELY JUST BECAUSE WE FEEL THAT. IN MANY CASES THE PENALTIES NOT FITTING THE CRIME DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE JUST SAY WE'RE JUST NOT GONNA TAKE IT ANYMORE I THINK WE SHOULD REALLY SHOULD TAKE A LOOK AT. WHAT WE'RE WHAT WE'RE CHARGING AND HOW MANY FEES ARE TACKED ON TO THESE TICKETS THAT YOU KNOW. MAYBE ORIGINALLY WERE FIFTY DOLLARS BUT THEN YOU START PUTTING COURT FEES IN THIS FEE AND THAT FEE. THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW THEY'RE THREE FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS NOT FOR A LOW INCOME PERSON IS REALLY HARD. THING TO OVERCOME SO I DO BELIEVE THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT THAT BUT I THINK THAT'S A SEPARATE ISSUE FROM THIS BILL. AND THEN SECONDLY THERE WAS A COMPANION BILL TO THIS ABOUT AUTOMATED SPEED ENFORCEMENT. THAT DID NOT MAKE IT THROUGH THE ASSEMBLY BUT I THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT PART. BECAUSE WHEN YOU HAVE THE AUTOMATED ENFORCEMENT PIECE YOU ARE ABLE TO REDUCE THOSE IN PERSON INTERACTIONS. AND THOSE TICKETS ARE MUCH LOWER THAN ANY TICKET THAT WILL BE GIVEN BY A LIVE OFFICER. SO I DO THINK THAT CITIES NEED TO BE MINDFUL OF WHERE THEY'RE ENFORCING THEY SHOULD CERTAINLY BE ENFORCING IN AREAS WHERE THEY'RE TRYING TO BRING THE SPEED LIMITS DOWN. THEY ALSO HAVE TOOLS AT THEIR DISPOSAL IN MY CITY OF GLENDALE IT'S VERY COMMON THAT THEY WILL GIVE WARNINGS TO PEOPLE ON THE FIRST OFFENSE WHEN IT COMES TO SPEEDING. BECAUSE THEY'RE REALLY TRYING TO DO AN EDUCATION OUTREACH AND THIS IS A POLICY. THAT THEY DID DELIBERATELY TALKED ABOUT WITH THE CITY COUNCIL THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE. NOT A- SPEED. BUT GOING. YOU KNOW. SEVEN TEN MILES AN HOUR OVER THE SPEED LIMIT IF THEY DON'T HAVE A PREVIOUS. INFRACTION IN A MANY TIMES IN GLENDALE THEY WILL GET A WARNING. SO THERE ARE POLICIES THAT CAN BE DONE BY CITIES WHO WANT TO ADDRESS. THIS CONCERN. BUT JUST BECAUSE WE ARE CHANGING THE THRESHOLD OF WHAT THE SPEED LIMIT IS. DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU'RE NECESSARILY GOING TO HAVE MORE OFFICERS ON THE STREET OR MORE ENFORCEMENT I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING TO REALLY BE MINDFUL OF- THERE DOES. THIS DOES THIS BILL ISN'T THERE'S AN IN NO WAY WILL ENCOURAGE CITIES TO GO OUT AND HIRE MORE MOTORCYCLE OFFICERS- SEND THEM TO DIFFERENT AREAS IT'S REALLY GOING TO BE THE SAME ENFORCEMENT IN THE SAME AREAS. BUT NOW THEY'LL HAVE THE TOOLS HOPEFULLY. TO SEND SIGNALS TO PEOPLE THAT THEY SHOULD BE DRIVING AT A LOWER RATE OF SPEED IN AN AREA. WHAT THANK YOU FOR THAT AND I MIGHT HOPE FOLKS WILL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE WARNINGS THAT YOU MENTION- AND I DO HAVE A COURT FEE WAIVER BILL THAT IS MAKING ITS WAY THROUGH OUR PROCESS HERE SO I APPRECIATE THAT- AS WELL ON- ON FEES- IN THE END- THAT YOU APPRECIATE YOU THINKING ABOUT THIS AND I DO BELIEVE WE SHOULD TRY TO A LOOK AT THAT WE TALK ABOUT AUTOMATED SPEED- THEN THAT'S FINE WE LOOK AT THAT IF IT DOES HAVE LOWER TICKETS BECAUSE WE KNOW THE RED LIGHT CAMERAS HAVE MASSIVE FINES. WHICH AGAIN ARE DEEPLY DEEPLY INEQUITABLE SO I APPRECIATE YOU- I DO THINK WE SHOULD LOOK AT THAT ALL IN THE FUTURE SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU IN A FIGHT MAY I CENTER BECKER THIS COMMITTEE I WOULD SAY DOES A PRETTY GOOD JOB OF ENSURING THAT WERE NOT BEING AS PUNITIVE BUT THAT WERE BEING- MORE EQUITABLE IN THE WAY THAT WE'RE- IMPLEMENTING FEE STRUCTURES- YOU'LL SEE THAT AND MANY OF THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS AND SO THE COMMITTEE CONSULTANTS HAVE DONE A GREAT JOB. OF THAT- I DON'T SEE ANY OTHER MIKES UP AT ALL JUST. CLOSE BY SAYING- YOU STARTED AT A VERY COLLABORATIVE SPACE AND THIS IS WHAT I APPRECIATE ABOUT THIS BILL THAT YOU HAD. STARTED WITH THE VISION ZERO TASK FORCE. COLLABORATIVE IN MANY SPACES EQUITY PARTNERS LAW ENFORCEMENT ALL THE PLAYERS WERE AT THE TABLE. AND WE HEARD FROM MANY OF THEM. AND AGAIN THIS IS HOPEFULLY WILL ENCOURAGE PLANS FOR THE LOCALS TO BE ABLE TO CHANGE THEIR STREETSCAPES IF THEY IF THEY NEED TO. WHICH IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS TO INTERCHANGE THE ENGINEERING IF NEED BE. TO ENSURE THAT REDUCING TRAFFIC FATALITIES. SO THANK YOU FOR THE BILL I SAID CERTAINLY SUPPORTED AND IF YOU'D LIKE TO CLOSE A FAMILY MEMBER WOULD LOVE TO HAVE THAT. I WOULD JUST SAY DO IT JUST TO KEEP IN MIND THAT THE SPEED LIMITS OUR- SERVER PURPOSE THEY'RE THERE FOR A REASON- AND- IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE REVIEW WHAT THEIR FUNCTION IS AND HOW THEY WORK. THE END ROADS WERE DESIGNED AT A TIME WHEN CARS WENT SLOWER. THEY FELT LIKE THEY WERE GOING FASTER THEY WERE FOR THE OCCUPANT. AND IT'S ABSOLUTELY IMPORTANT AS THE OPPOSITION RAISE THAT CITIES FOCUS ON ST ENGINEERING THAT IS KEY. BUT THERE'S NOTHING IN THE LAW NOW THAT REWARDS THAT INVESTMENT WOULD BE ABILITY TO CAPTURE LOWER SPEED LIMITS. ALONG WITH THAT AND ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT. MODALITIES NEED TO BE SEEN IN CONCERT TOGETHER. THE ENFORCEMENT THE EDUCATION. BUT ALSO. THE SPEED LIMITS THEY ALL HAVE A ROLE TO PLAY AND CITIES FOR YEARS HAVE BEEN STYMIED BY THIS. THIS BEING FORCED TO RAISE SPEED LIMITS TO ACCOMMODATE SPEEDING DRIVERS AND FASTER CARS. CARS AND FUEL MAKE THE ROOM FEEL SAFER THAN IT ACTUALLY IS. AND THE RESULT HAS BEEN ANINCREASE IN DEATHS PEDESTRIAN AND BICYCLIST DEATHS CONSISTENTLY. OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS. IF WE HAVE FOUR THOUSAND PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA DYING EVERY YEAR IN PLANE CRASHES WOULD PROBABLY GROUND THE FLEET IN A MINUTE. BUT SOMEHOW WE. ACCEPT THAT WHEN IT COMES TO PEDESTRIAN AND BICYCLE FATALITIES- AND WITH THAT I DID IS ONE PIECE OF THAT PUZZLE AND I URGE MY VOTE. THANK YOU THANK YOU SOMETHING MEMBER DO YOU HAVE A MOTION ON A. B. FORTY THREE. MOTION BY SENATOR RUBIO ALL RIGHT THANK YOU SENATOR- MISTER CHIEF CONSULTANT CAN YOU PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED AND REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS. CENTER CONSULTS FIVE DOLLARS I BATES. BATES I HELEN WHAT'S A LETTER. BECKER HI THERE I PUT EIGHTY CORTESE I. DALI DOLLY NO DOT. WHERE MELINDA'S. MAN NEWMAN HUMANITE RUBIO RUBIO HI SKINNER. NUMBER BY CAL SKI. WELL. SIX ONE OKAY SIX ONE WILL LEAVE THE BILL ON CALL THANK YOU AND WE HAVE OUR NEXT BILL ALSO BY ASSEMBLYWOMAN FRIEDMAN THAT'S VIOLATED NUMBER. TEN EIGHTY ELEVEN FORTY SEVEN. THANK YOU- IT INSTEAD MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS I WANT TO THANK YOU AND YOUR STAFF FOR YOUR HELP WITH THIS BILL. AB ELEVEN FORTY SEVEN TAKES A MULTI FACETED APPROACH TO CIRCLE FORNEY ON THE COURSE TO MEET ITS GREENHOUSE EMISSION REDUCTION TARGETS. BY MAKING CHANGES AT THE STATE LOCAL AND REGIONAL LEVEL TO PROVIDE TOOLS ACCOUNTABILITY AND INCENTIVES. TO METROPOLITAN PLANNING ORGANIZATIONS NPOS TO MEET THERE TWENTY TWENTY THREE REGIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION TARGETS. S. B. THREE SEVENTY FIVE BY DARRELL STEINBERG IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT ABOUT SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES WAS A FIRST OF ITS KIND AND GROUNDBREAKING LAW THAT RECOGNIZES THE CRUCIAL ROLE. OF INTEGRATING TRANSPORTATION LAND USE AND HOUSING DECISIONS TO MEET UR CLIMATE GOALS BASICALLY TO DESIGN OUR CITIES IN SUCH A WAY THAT WE GIVE PEOPLE MORE OPTIONS TO WALK AND BIKE. HOWEVER THE REPORTS FROM THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD THE LA- AND OTHERS HAS SAID THAT AS WELL INTENTIONED AS THAT BILL WAS IT'S NOT HASN'T YET ACHIEVED. REALLY AT SCHOOL AND OUR ADMISSIONS FROM TRANSPORTATION CONTINUE TO CLIMB. ELEVEN FORTY SEVEN REQUIRES THE NPOS TO CREATE A TWENTY TWENTY FIVE TARGET-ACTION PLAN TO DEVELOP AND IT ALSO DEVELOPS A BLOCK GRANT PROGRAM. TO PROVIDE FUNDING TO THOSE NPOS TO ACHIEVE THOSE GOALS. AND THE REASON WE LEAVE IT UP TO AND THEN HE OWES BECAUSE ADMISSION EMISSION REDUCTIONS ARE GOING TO LOOK VERY DIFFERENT IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY THAN THE LOOKING OVER LOS ANGELES. THEN LOOK IN SAN FRANCISCO ALL OF THESE COMMUNITIES HAVE WAYS OF REDUCING VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED. AND THIS BILL GIVES. THEM FUNDING TO HELP ACHIEVE THAT- THE BUDGET CONTAINED HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR BLOCK GRANTS TO IMPLEMENT. S. C. O. S. AND WE'RE IN DISCUSSIONS WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE BUDGET STUFF ABOUT THIS BILL. AND HOW IT INTERSECTS WITH THE BUDGET PROPOSAL. IF THE TRAILER BILLS VOTED ON LATER THIS WEEK WE WILL SUBMIT AMENDMENTS TO REMOVE THE BLOCK GRANT PROGRAM AND ALIGN THE BILL TO THE BUDGET ACTION SO WE'VE BEEN IN CONVERSATION WITH THE ADMINISTRATION. ABOUT HOW THIS BILL INTEGRATES WITH THEIR GOALS AND THEIR BUDGET. IN ADDITION WE PLAN ON PROVIDING AUTHORS AMENDMENTS TO THE SENATE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE THAT WILL ADJUST THE USE OF THE TERM VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED. TO CONSIDER ALL THE RAMIFICATIONS OF BMT REDUCTION ON JOBS IN THE ECONOMY AND LOW INCOME COMMUTERS. WITH THESE AMENDMENTS WE BELIEVE THAT THE OPPOSITION WILL HOPEFULLY GO NEUTRAL ON THE BILL. WE HAVE A GROUP OF BILLS HERE TO TALK TO US ABOUT THIS BILL BILL MCGEE EVEN FROM THE COALITION FOR CLEAN AIR. AND BILL HIGGINS FROM CAL COG IN SUPPORT WITH THAT IRISH AND I BOTH THINK THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER THAT FIRST MODERATOR WE HAVE MISTER BILL MCGOVERN. WITH THE COALITION FOR CLEAN AIR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR THIS IS BILL MCGOVERN WITH COALITION FOR CLEAN AIR AND WE STRONGLY SUPPORT. THE B. ELEVEN FORTY SEVEN BECAUSE IT WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE THE STATE'S EFFORTS. TO PROVIDE TRANSPORTATION CHOICES. THAT REDUCE HARMFUL AIR ND CLIMATE POLLUTION. AS WELL AS VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED. CALIFORNIA WELL WE'VE LED THE NATION IN APPLYING ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES TO VEHICLE ENGINES AND PROMOTING INNOVATION IN TRANSPORTATION FUELS. WE HAVE STRUGGLED TO ALIGN LAND USE. WITH THE NEED TO REDUCE VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED. AND ITS CORRESPONDING EMISSIONS THAT ARE CAUSING. THE TWIN CRISES OF AIR POLLUTION AND CLIMATE CHANGE. THE PASSAGE OF SB THREE SEVENTY FIVE- AS MISTREATMENT SAID. RAISED HOPES FOR A PARADIGM SHIFT BUT THAT WAS NOT A BIG DEAL BEING IT'S INTENDED CLIMATE HEALTH EQUITY AND CONSERVATION RESULTS. OF THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR IS THE LEADING SOURCE OF ERROR IN CLIMATE SOLUTION WE DO NEED TO REDUCE VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED AND THIS BILL WOULD MAKE THE FIRST REALLY IMPORTANT IMPROVEMENTS IN SP THREE SEVENTY FIVE. IN THE THIRTEEN YEARS SINCE IT IS PAST. IT WOULD GET THE BILL WITH THE DIFFERENT GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES TALKING TO EACH OTHER WHICH IS CRUCIAL. AND ALSO WELL I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF DISAGREEMENT ON THE ISSUE OF VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED SOMETHING THAT WE ALL AGREE ON IS THAT WE NEED MORE FUNDING. FOR SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES AND THIS BILL WOULD HAVE THE FUNDING AND DIRECTED IN THE RIGHT WAY. WE ALSO ARE IN SUPPORT OF FIFTEEN MINUTE COMMUNITIES AND- BICYCLE HIGHWAYS AND SO FOR ALL THOSE REASONS WE SUPPORT THIS BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU MR MCGOVERN- NEXT WE HAVE MISTER BILL HIGGINS FROM CAL COG. GOOD MORNING THIS IS BILL HIGGINS FROM THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION COUNCIL THE GOVERNMENT THAT REPRESENTS A REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION PLANNING AGENCIES ACROSS THE STATE AND ALSO ALL EIGHTEEN METROPOLITAN PLANNING ORGANIZATIONS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIRTY THREE SEVENTY FIVE. FIRST OF ALL WE WANT TO THANK ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRIEDMAN FOR HER LEADERSIP HER WILLINGNESS TO DIG DOWN IN HERE ALL THE PERSPECTIVES IT'S BEEN GREAT TO WORK WITH OUR WE HAVE HAD A FEW COMMANDMENTS POSITION FROM THE BEGINNING APPRECIATING HER WORK. BECAUSE OUR BOARDS ARE MADE UP OF CITY AND COUNTY OFFICIALS AND THEY HAD SOME CONCERNS AND WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THEM MY UNDERSTANDING IS WHAT THE AUTHORS AMENDMENT SUGGESTING THAT THOSE. WILL BE OUR CONCERNS WILL BE ADDRESSED AND WE'RE TAKING THE WIN LET IT OUT WE'RE TAKING THAT TO OUR BOARD AND I ANTICIPATE A CHANGE POSITION VERY SHORTLY BUT I WANTED TO SAY- ONE THING A COUPLE OF THE THINGS THAT THIS BILL REALLY DOES. THAT WORK CUT IT OUT FIRST OF ALL THE BLOCK GRANT PROGRAM THAT IN THE BUDGET THAT- SIMPLY MEMBER HAS BEEN LEADING ON IS ONE THING THAT WE'VE BEEN ASKING FOR TWELVE YEARS A LOT OF FOLKS THAT SAID WELL THREE SEVENTY FIVE DOING EVERYTHING THAT IT SHOULD. IT'S NEVER BEN FUNDED THE WAY IT'S ABOUT TO BE FUNDED AND WE ARE EXCITED TO SEE THE RESULTS. THE SECOND THING IS THOSE SMALL CHANGE IN THE LANGUAGE THAT DEALS WITH HOW THE STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNCIL WILL ANALYZE THE STATE TRANSPORTATION PLAN- AND IT IS IN A WAY THAT I. THINK IS REALLY RELEVANT TO THIS COMMITTEE- THE-STAKES. PLAN IS NOW UP THIS WEEK. STOCKMAN FOR OUR REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION PLAN FOR THIS YEAR THE CARD THE DIFFERENCES. WITH BOTH TRY AND ACHIEVE THE MOST WE CAN BUT IN A PICKLE CONSTRAINED DOCUMENT YOU CAN ONLY DO IT WITH THE EXPECTED REVENUES. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THIS BILL THAT IS ANALYZED THAT DIFFERENCE. AND TO GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE OF ONE OF THE THINGS OUR MEMBERS ARE STRUGGLING WITH- WE EMBRACE THE TRANSITION TO ELECTRIC VEHICLES. BUT WE'RE ALSO CONCERNED THAT IN OUR TRANSPORTATION PLANS THAT ARE ON THE BOOKS RIGHT NOW. WE'VE MADE SOME REVENUE ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT GAS TAXES THAT WON'T MATERIALIZES IN THE TRANSITION TO ELECTRIC VEHICLES. AND THERE'S NO BACK BILLING WHEN WE LOOK OUT IN THE OUT YEARS WE HAVE A LOT OF MITIGATION STRATEGIES THAT WE'RE THINKING ABOUT THAT WILL BE. AT THE STATE WILL BE ONE TO FOUR BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR SHORT ON BECAUSE THEY WILL BE THE GAS TAX REVENUES TO FILL IT OUT. WE THINK THAT- THIS STUDY WILL ALLOW US TO DO LIKE SOME OF THOSE ISSUES TO TALK ABOUT THOSE ISSUES SO THAT WE CAN PLAN AHEAD. SO THAT WE CAN HAVE A WELL FUNDED. SUSTAINABLE TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM NOT ONLY NOW BUT GOING TO TWENTY FORTY SO WE APPRECIATE- MISTREATMENT LEADERSHIP ON THAT. AND THANK YOU FOR OFFERING THIS BILL THANK YOU MR HIGGINS A PREACHER TESTIMONY. ALL RIGHT- WILL GO TO THE COASTLINE AGAIN I'M SORRY THE CONFERENCE LINE AGAIN IF THERE ARE ANY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT.

THAT AFTERNOON YEP GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND SENATORS THIS BILL AUTHORIZES LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO MAKE TEMPORARY SLOW STREETS PERMANENT. IN ADDITION AB SEVEN SEVEN THREE AUTHORIZES LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO ADOPT A RULE OR REGULATION TO DESIGNATE A LOCAL STREET WITHIN ITS JURISDICTION AS A SLOW STREET. THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES HAS IMPLEMENTED TEMPORARY PROGRAMS DURING THE COPA NINETEEN PANDEMIC THAT HAVE CREATED MORE THAN FIFTY MILES OF SLOW STREETS. FOR PEOPLE FOR THE RESIDENTS ESPECIALLY THAT NEED IT THE MOST- THIS IS BEEN A WINNING CONCEPT IT'S A CONCEPT THAT'S BEEN USED UTILIZED QUITE A BIT IN OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD- CREATING MORE OPEN SPACE FOR BICYCLING WALKING WHILE INCREASING OPPORTUNITIES FOR RECREATION. THOSE TWEETS PROGRAM HAS BEEN MET WITH AN OVERWHELMING DEMAND FROM THE RESIDENTS AND DOZENS OF NEIGHBORHOODS ARE WAITING ON LOCAL INSTALLATIONS TO CONTINUE AND EXPAND THIS PROGRAM AND TO REALIZE THE FULL LONG TERM BENEFITS- SLOW STREETS THE PERMANENCE AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL DOES- A.

FOLKS IN MY DISTRICT ON WHAT THEY CALL COMPLETE STREETS N. I THINK THIS IS A HUGE STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND- THE GOAL OF ROSSI COMPREHENSIVE INTEGRATIVE APPROACH TO MANAGING OUR STREETS A SHARED. PUBLIC SPACES FOR SOCIALISING RETREATING GET TO WORK SHOPPING AND GATHERING AND I HOPE AS WE LOOK AT THIS ISSUE EVEN GOING FOR THE FURTHER AS YOU WORK TO MAKE OUR STREETS SAFER AS WE'VE DONE WITH THIS BUILD ONE EARLIER TODAY. WE CAN ALSO MAKE THEM MORE ATTRACTIVE WE BETTER MANAGE STORMWATER INCREASE OUR NATURE OUR URBAN TREE CANOPY A NATIVE PLANTS- BEYOND SEE ALL KIND OF BENEFITS THAT WHEN WE MANAGE OUR STREETS AND PUBLIC SPACES. AS A SHARED ASSET THE BENEFIT OF FOR ALL NOT JUST AS CONDUITS FOR CAR TRUCK TRAFFIC SO AGAIN I COMMEND THE AUTHOR AND- I WILL MOVE THE BILL WHEN APPROPRIATE. THANK YOU SENATOR BAKER I DON'T SEE ANY OTHER MIKES UP- ASSEMBLYMEMBER NAZARIAN I JUST WANNA THANK YOU AS WELL FOR WORKING WITH OUR COMMITTEE AND THIS IS GOING TO BE A GREAT BENEFIT FOR MANY LOCATIONS I'D LIKE TO SEE THEM HISTORICALLY IN PLACES THEY HAVEN'T BEEN SO LIKE SOUTH LOS ANGELES OUT THESE DELAY- PLACES WHERE PEOPLE REALLY.

WE HAVE ASSEMBLY MEMBER LOWELL WHO IS ABOUT TO PRESENT FILE ITEM SEVEN AND I APOLOGIZE FOR GOING IN AND OUT OF ORDER BUT YOU KNOW IT'S VERY BUSY SEASON RIGHT NOW. ASSEMBLY MEMBER LOW WILL BE PRESENTING ON AB SEVEN TWO THREE WELCOME ASSEMBLY MEMBER. COMMITTING MADAM CHAIR AND COLLEAGUES THIS IS ASSEMBLY BILL SEVEN TWENTY THREE WHICH WOULD ALLOW THE DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES TO ESTABLISH A RECIPROCAL DRIVER'S LICENSE AGREEMENT. BETWEEN CALIFORNIA AND OTHER COUNTRIES. CLOSE TO THIRTY STATES ALREADY HAVE SUCH PROGRAMS IN PLACE I'M HOPE TO CREATE NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR COUNTRIES TO CREATE RECIPROCAL AGREEMENTS WITH ME TODAY IS THE STEAM CONSUL GENERAL OF JAPAN CONSUL GENERAL MYERS. WITH RESPECT WE ASKED RIVAL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- WE HAVE YES THE CONSUL GENERAL OF JAPAN TORU MEHTA. WE BELIEVE IS HERE IN PERSON. MR CONSUL GENERAL WELCOME THANK YOU FOR JOINING US IF YOU GO THROUGH THE- GO GO. BUT I'M SURE THE LOCAL COMMITTEE MEMBERS GOOD MORNING BUT I'M STILL REMINDED POSITIONAL DISCIPLINE IS OF A CISCO. I'M VERY MUCH HONORED AND GRATEFUL FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXPRESS THEIR OPINION ABOUT THE EIGHTY SEVEN TO THREE ON BEHALF OF THE JAPANESE GOVERNMENT. WHICH THAT WE EXPECT THAT IF THE BILL AB SEVEN TWENTY THREE HIS PAST OF THE BURDEN ASSOCIATED WITH GETTING DRIVER'S LICENSES REDUCED THE QUALITY OF LIVES OF JAPANESE PEOPLE LIVING IN CALIFORNIA AND CALIFORNIA PEOPLE LIVING IN JAPAN. FLUTE CERTAINLY REDUCED. WELL WE SAW IMPROVED QUALITY OF LIFE WOULD BE TO BE PROVED BY THE MALL AS A RESULT THIS DEPARTMENT BECAUSE MANY RELATIONS WILL BE STRENGTHENED IN THE AREAS OF BUSINESS TOURISM. AND MANY OTHERS. SYSTEM IS THE LARGEST FOREIGN INVESTOR IN CALIFORNIA. MANY JAPANESE BUSINESSPERSONS HAVE COME TO LIVE AND DO BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA. I HOPE THIS BILL IF IT COMES. INTO EFFECT. WILL FURTHER TO A GREAT JAPANESE COMPANIES AN INFANT INTO PRINTERS TO INVEST AND OPERATE IN CALIFORNIA. HELLO BOYS FOR THE CURRENT ONE AND CONFLICTS. BUT AS OF TODAY JAPAN HAS SYMBOLS HE'S WITH TWENTY NINE COUNTRIES AND REGIONS FULL RECIPROCAL PARTS OF THE ENGINE. OF THE EXAMINATION OF THE FULL DRIVER'S LICENSE. TO BURN AS EMBASSIES WITH THE SIX U. S. STATES NAMELY INDIANA OHIO VIRGINIA POLITE MARILYN AND WASHINGTON. THE LOCAL SIMS OF COMMERCE INDUSTRIES HAVE OPENLY EXPRESSED THEIR APPRECIATION FOR THE EXEMPTION THE FULL. THE JAPANESE GOVERNMENT IS VERY MUCH INTERESTED IN PURSUING SUCH INTIMACY WITH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. BUT I HOPE THIS BILL WOULD ENCOURAGE SUCH ANIMAL C. HOWEVER TAKING THIS OPPORTUNITY I'D LIKE TO DRAW THE ATTENTION O THE HONORABLE COMMITTEE MEMBERS TO THE FOLLOWING THREE POINTS.

THANK YOU SENATOR. SENATORS CHAIR AND MEMBERS- EIGHTY THIRTEEN OH TWO CODIFIES REGULATIONS THAT THE BUREAU OF CANNABIS CONTROL ADOPTED WITH RESPECT TO CANNABIS ADVERTISING ALONG HIGHWAYS. SPECIFICALLY THIS BILL WILL ALLOW CANNABIS LICENSEES TO ADVERTISE OR MARKET ONE OF BILLBOARDS ALONG THE HIGHWAY THAT IS FURTHER THAN FIFTEEN MILE RADIUS FROM CALIFORNIA VOTERS BORDER. WHICH IN PROP SIXTY FOUR STATES THE LICENSEE SHALL NOT ADVERTISE OR MARKET ON A BILLBOARD OR SIMILAR ADVERTISING DEVICE LOCATED ON INTERSTATE OR STATE HIGHWAY THAT CROSSES THE CALIFORNIA BORDER. THIS IS ALREADY PROBLEMATIC BECAUSE STATE HIGHWAYS DON'T CROSS THE BORDER. IN TWENTY NINETEEN THE BUREAU OF CANNABIS CONTROL CONCLUDED THE PROP SIXTY FOUR DOES NOT CLARIFY TO WHAT EXTENT SUCH PROHIBITIONS WOULD TAKE PLACE FELT THAT A FIFTEEN MILE RADIUS WAS APPROPRIATE. TWO THINGS I'D LIKE TO NOTE MY STAKEHOLDERS REACHED OUT TO SOME OF THE ORIGINAL DRAFTERS OF PROPOSITION SIXTY FOUR. TO SEE IF THEY COULD SHARE BACKGROUND AND WHY THE LANGUAGE WAS ADDED AND NONE COULD RECALL. MY SUPPORTERS AND I FIND IT DIFFICULT TO COMPREHEND THAT WE WOULD FORMALLY LEGALIZED INDUSTRY. BUT MAKE ADVERTISEMENT SO RESTRICTIVE THAT IT WOULD ESSENTIALLY PROHIBIT THEM FROM ADVERTISING ALTOGETHER. UNFORTUNATELY THE BUREAU'S REGULATIONS WERE CHALLENGED IN THE ST LOUIS OBISPO COURT WHICH RULED THAT THE BUREAU LACKED AUTHORITY IN IMPLEMENTING THESE REGULATIONS. MY SUPPORTERS AND I FUNDAMENTALLY DISAGREE ON THIS POINT WHICH IS WHY THIS BILL WILL FORMALLY CODIFY THESE REGULATIONS. I THOUGHT THE DECISION ISSUED BY THE JUDGE IN THE FORMER CASE PROHIBITS BILLBOARDS ALONG FOUR THOUSAND MILES OF INTERSTATE HIGHWAYS INCLUDING I. FIVE I. TEN AND I. EIGHTY. ADVERTISEMENT IS A LISLE ALLOWED ALONG ALL SEGMENTS OF I. FOUR OH FIVE I SEVEN TEN I. EIGHT EIGHTY FIVE FIVE EIGHTY HIGHWAY THIRTY SEVEN. CALIFORNIA STATE ROUTE.

YES ON AGAIN THANKS VERY MUCH FOR HEARING THIS BILL- I'D LIKE TO EMPHASIZE THAT. CHILDREN HAVE BEEN GETTING- MARIJUANA CANNABIS FOR YEARS FIVE A FORTY YEAR OLD DAUGHTER AND A THIRTY FOUR YEAR OLD SON MY DAUGHTER WAS EXPOSED TO CANNABIS WHILE IN HIGH SCHOOL BEING SOLD ON OUR CAMPUS MY SON WAS EXPOSED TO A MIDDLE SCHOOL. THIS IS BECAUSE WE HAVE AN ILLEGAL INDUSTRY. WE ARE PREVENTING THE LEGAL INDUSTRY WHICH DOES NOT SELL TO CHILDREN FROM FLOURISHING IF WE KEEP THIS BAN ON I. TEN I. EIGHTY I. FIVE. SO I WOULD JUST ASK YOU TO HELP US SUPPORT THE LEGAL INDUSTRY. I'LL ALSO POINT OUT THAT WHAT CAN BE PUT ON THESE BILLS BILLBOARDS IS HIGHLY REGULATED NOTHING THAT APPEAL TO CHILDREN CAN DO IT FURTHERMORE 72% OF THE PEOPLE WHO THE REGULATION IS SUCH THAT 72% AT LEAST OF THE PEOPLE WHO SEE THIS HAVE TO BE ADULTS- WE BELIEVE. THAT IT IS VERY ARD TO INTERPRET. A BILL WHICH AS YOU CAN ADVERTISE ON THE STATE HIGHWAY. THAT CROSSES THE BORDER WHEN NO STATE HIGHWAY DOES. WE DON'T THINK THAT WHOEVER PUT THAT IN. HAD ANY INTENTION OF ALLOWING- THE ADVERTISEMENTS ON THE FOUR OH FIVE FOUR EIGHTY EIGHTY BUT NOT ON EIGHTY FOUR NOT ON FIVE. SO WHAT'S THERE IT'S VERY HARD TO INTERPRET WE THINK THAT THE- AGENCY IN CHARGE GOT THIS RIGHT WHICH IS WHY WE'RE PROPOSING THIS. AND AGAIN WE DON'T KNOW WHAT WHOEVER PUT THAT IN HAD MINE BECAUSE IT SIMPLY WASN'T. PUT DOWN. HAVING GONE THROUGH A LEGISLATIVE PROCESS I DOUBT ANYTHING WITHOUT WORDING WOULD HAVE GOT THROUGH. SO I THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR ATTENTION- WHEN THERE WERE ALSO SOME STUDIES ABOUT THIS AND THAT AND CLAIMS- I COULD JUST SAY THAT CORRELATION IS NOT THE SAME AS CAUSATION. I CAN SAY THAT THERE ARE LOTS OF STUDIES THAT SHOW IN FACT THAT CANNABIS IS NOT- SOMETHING WHICH- ARE IMPAIRED DRIVERS SHOULD ANYWAY I LIKE THE WAY HAT- CANADA THAT ALCOHOL DOES. I COULD SURE USE STUDIES AND ALL SORTS OF THINGS BUT RIGHT NOW WHAT I'M ASKING IS THAT WE SUPPORT THE LEGAL INDUSTRY SO WILL OUT COMPETE THE ILLEGAL INDUSTRY WHICH SELLS TO OUR KIDS THAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE THANK YOU.

SEVENTY SIX SIX TO IMPROVE AND REFINE THE CALIFORNIA NEW MOTOR VOTER PROGRAM. TO ENSURE ITS CONTINUED SUCCESS AND EFFECTIVENESS WHEN CALIFORNIA LAUNCHED THE NEW MOTOR VOTER PROGRAM IN APRIL TWENTY EIGHTEEN IT BECAME THE LARGEST AND ONE OF THE FIRST STATES TO IMPLEMENT AUTOMATIC. VOTER REGISTRATION TO THE DMV. NEW MOTOR VOTER HAS MADE IT EASIER FOR ELIGIBLE VOTERS TO REGISTER OR UPDATE THEIR REGISTRATION WHEN COMPLETING A DRIVER'S LICENSE AND STATE IDENTIFICATION CARD APPLICATIONS. IT IS PLAYED AN INSTRUMENTAL ROLE IN CLOSING VOTER REGISTRATION GAPS. AS WELL AS IMPROVING THE ACCURACY OF VOTERS MAILING ADDRESSES WHICH IS CRUCIAL TO INCREASING ACCESS TO VOTE BY MAIL VOTING. BETWEEN APRIL TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN IN JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY ONE MORE THAN TWELVE MILLION NEW OR UPDATED VOTER REGISTRATIONS RESULTED FROM THE NEW MOTOR VOTER PROGRAM. DESPITE THE SUCCESSES CHALLENGES WITH MODERNIZING THE MOTOR VOTER REGISTRATION PROCESS. CONTINUE TO LIMIT THE PROGRAM'S EFFECTIVENESS. AT ITS HEART A. B. SEVENTY SIX WOULD. APPLY LESSONS LEARNED AND ADOPT FEDERAL MOTOR VOTER TIMELINES FOR CAP THE TRANSMITTAL. OF VOTER REGISTRATION INFORMATION FROM THE DMV TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE. AS WELL AS CODIFIED NUMBER BEST PRACTICES FROM THE ONGOING LEGAL SETTLEMENT INCLUDING DATA REPORTING ON PROCESSING TIMES. TRAINING OF DMV AND SECRETARY OF STATE STAFF. IN MAINTAINING COORDINATORS AT THE DMV AND SECRETARY OF STATE TO MONITOR COMPLIANCE WITH THE FEDERAL AND STATE. MOTOR VOTER LAWS. THIRTY SEVEN NINETY SIX WILL ENSURE THAT THE PROGRESS MADE UNDER OUR NEW MOTOR VOTER PROGRAM WILL CONTINUE. AND KEEP CALIFORNIA'S VOTER ROLLS ACCURATE AND UP TO DATE. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AND I VOTE ON EIGHTY SEVEN NINETY SIX AND WITH ME. OUR DOOR ROSE ON BEHALF OF THE LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS AND BRITNEY STONECIPHER.

THE BUILDER CENTRAL TO OUR SHARED MISSION BECAUSE LITERALLY STRETCHING OUT HELLO. CHUCK SPAN BUILDING ACCESS. AND ULTIMATELY. TO CREATE A MORE REPRESENTATIVE WILL ACTUALLY. QATAR HAS BEEN PRACTICE USUALLY TO COUNSEL MOTOR VOTER PROGRAM MOST OF WHICH YOU'VE BEEN INCREASED SINCE TWENTY EIGHTEEN PURSUANT TO LEGAL SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS CONTRACTUALLY SET TO EXPIRE IN EARLY TWENTY TWENTY TWO. THE NEW MOTOR VOTER PROGRAM TO STREAMLINE THE VOTER REGISTRATION PROCESS IT MADE IT MORE CONVENIENT TO REGISTER OR UPDATE VOTER REGISTRATIONS AND GOING THROUGH. A DRIVER'S LICENSE OR ID TRANSACTIONS AT THE DMV. SINCE THE ROLLOUT OF THE PROGRAM THREE YEARS AGO THERE'S BEEN ALMOST FOURTEEN MILLION NEW OR UPDATED VOTER REGISTRATION BUT THE IN THE INDIAN OCEAN ABOUT. TWELVE MILLION- MENTIONED IN THE LAST YEAR THAT INCLUDES ABOUT TEN AND A HALF MILLION UPDATED REGISTRATIONS IN ABOUT THREE AND A HALF MILLION NEW VOTERS BEING ADDED TO THE WALL. SO pUP THE HIGHEST THE REGISTRATION RATE IN RECENT HISTORY 88% OF OUR ELIGIBLE POPULATIONS. HOW DESPITE THESE ADVANCES. MORE THAN TWO MILLION ELEGY ADULTS REMAIN UNREGISTERED AND UNFORTUNATELY A DISPROPORTIONATE NUMBER THOSE PEOPLE ARE FROM UNDERREPRESENTED GROUPS SO. WE'VE GOT TO CLOSE THAT GAP TO REFLECT THE REALITY OF OUR STATE'S DIVERSE DEMOGRAPHICS TO MOVE. BEYOND WHAT YOU KNOW FOR DOMINO LIKE OLDER WHITE ACTOR. THE GUY WAS SURE THAT THE G. IN THE PROCESS CONTINUES TO IMPROVE THE ACCURACY OF OUR VOTER ROLLS SOMETHING THAT IS. INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT ACTUALLY IS MORE CALIFORNIA YOU KNOW. POSSIBLY ALL OF THOSE. SOON WE'RE GONNA BE RECEIVING ABOUT. WHICH IS TO BACKS ON THE- THESE SHOULD BE THE CATCH IS. I DON'T AGREE. WE GOT A THE MORE TOWARD MARK DEMOCRACY. SO WE URGE YOU TO APPEAR EITHER. THANK YOU. THANK MISS ROSE SWEEPING THE TESTIMONY AND NEXT WE HAVE BRITNEY'S STONECIPHER WITH THE ACLU IN SUPPORT OF SB. SEVEN NINETY SIX. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS BERNIE FOUND FAVOR AND I WITH ACLU OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA A PROUD CO SPONSOR OF EIGHTY SEVEN NINETY SIX. ACLU IN OUR PARTNERS HAS SPENT MANY YEARS ADVOCATING TO INCREASE THE FAIRNESS AND EFFICIENCY OF THE MOTOR VOTER SYSTEM. IN RECENT YEARS THE ADVOCACY HAS TAKEN THE FORM OF THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT THAT THE DMV AND THE SECRETARY OF STATE. UNDER THAT SETTLEMENT PNB AND THE SECTOR AND THEN PROVIDING DETAILED MONTHLY REPORT ABOUT THE PROCESSING OF VOTER REGISTRATION APPLICATIONS AT THE M. B. AS WELL AS REGULARLY. MEETING WITH THIS GUY THIS REPORT. THE TRANSPARENT AND ACCOUNTABILITY THAT THESE REQUIREMENTS HAVE CREATED A DMB. ALLOWED STAKEHOLDERS TO IDENTIFY COLLAPSE AND COLLABORATIVE LEE RESOLVED SYSTEMIC ISSUES THAT ARE DELAYING THE REGISTRATION. IT ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED CALIFORNIA'S COMPLIANCE WITH STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTIONS WELL. UNFORTUNATELY HOWEVER THESE REQUIREMENTS WHICH HAVE BEEN SO CRITICAL TO TRANSFORMING THE MOTOR VOTER PROGRAM INTO THE SUCCESS IT IS TODAY WILL EXPIRE IN EARLY TWENTY TWENTY TALE. EIGHTY SEVEN NINETY SIX WILL CODIFY BEST PRACTICES ALREADY IN PLACE AT THE DMV AND RESULT THAT CUSTOMER. AND CREATE MORE CLARITY AND CONSISTENCY ACROSS THE N. B. WORKSTREAM. EITHER COMMON SENSE PROVISIONS LIKE REQUIRING DMB TO CONTINUE TRACKING AND REPORTING REGISTRATION PROCESSING TIME. REQUIRING THE SECRETARY INDIAN B. TO TRAIN RELEVANT STUFF AND HOW THE MOTOR VOTER SYSTEM MARK. BY CLEARLY DEFINING TIMELINES FOR DMB TO PROCESS MOTOR VOTER RECORDS. THE BILL ALSO ENSURE THAT ELIGIBLE INDIVIDUALS ARE NOT DISENFRANCHISED BECAUSE A BACKLOG IN THE IN THE MAIL ROOM OR ADMINISTRATIVE RED TAPE.

WILL MODERNIZE THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION'S CLEAN TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM. BY REVISING THE PROGRAM TO SUPPORT INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS IN THE CLEAN TRANSPORTATION SECTOR INVESTMENTS IN OUR MOST POLLUTED AREAS. THE CLEAN TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM HAS BEEN A CRITICAL TOOL TO ADVANCING CLEAN VEHICLE TECHNOLOGY IN CALIFORNIA THE PROGRAM IS TECHNOLOGY AND FUEL NEUTRAL. AND IS MEANT TO DEPLOY INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES THAT TRANSFORM CALIFORNIA'S FUEL AND VEHICLE TYPES. EIGHTY THIRTEEN EIGHTY NINE WILL INCORPORATE PROGRAM CHANGES THAT WILL FOCUS INVESTMENTS IN. ONE ADDRESSING INFRASTRUCTURE GAPS IN THE IN THE CLEAN LIGHT DUTY VEHICLE MARKET TO SUPPORT INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THE EMERGING CLEAN MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY VEHICLE FREIGHT INDUSTRY. AND THREE DEDICATE 5050% OF FUNDING TO PROJECTS LOCATED IN AND BENEFITING DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES. CALIFORNIA HAS SOME OF THE WORST AIR QUALITY IN THE COUNTRY MANY OF THESE AIR POLLUTANTS COME FROM THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY AND THE SOUTH COAST AIR BASIN ARE CURRENTLY CLASSIFIED AS EXTREME NON ATTAINMENT AREAS THE WORST CLASSIFICATION. UNDER THE FEDERAL CLEAN AIR ACT MANY OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE SUCH AS THE BAY AREA AND SACRAMENTO RANGE FROM MODERATE TO SEVERE NON ATTAINMENT. CLEANING UP THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR IS AT THE INTERSECTION OF ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. URBANIZING THIS INDUSTRY WILL HELP CLEAN THE AIR FOR COMMUNITIES AND HELP THE STATE MEET ITS CLIMATE GOALS HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL TODAY IS MEREDITH ALEXANDER WITH CAL START. HIS ALEXANDER'S HERE AND PRESENT IN THE GALLERY A PLEASE PROCEED WITH ALEXANDER. GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN WALLIS AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS I'M HERE TO HELP XANDER POLICY DIRECTOR FOR CAL START HERE IS THE SPONSOR OF EIGHTY THIRTEEN EIGHTY NINE. FIRST WE WISH TO THANK SENATOR GONZALEZ FOR HER LEADERSHIP AND OF COURSE ASSEMBLY MEMBER RAY S. HER TEAM AND THE COMMITTEE STAFF WHO WORKED HARD WITH US ON THIS POLICY. CAN START AS A MEMBER BASED NONPROFIT WITH OVER TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY MEMBERS DEDICATED TO TRANSFORMING TRANSPORTATION. INCLUDING VEHICLE MANUFACTURERS ZERO EMISSION AN ALTERNATE FUEL PRODUCERS PUBLIC AND PRIVATE FLEETS AND MORE. THE ENERGY COMMISSION'S CLEAN TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM HAS BEEN A CRITICALELEMENT OF OUR STATE'S TRANSPORTATION CLEAN AIR AND CLIMATE PROGRAMS. IT IS TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL AND HAS HELPED ADVANCE VEHICLE AND FEELING TECHNOLOGIES HOWEVER WE PASSED MANY LANDMARK CLIMATE LAWS SINCE THE PROGRAM WAS ESTABLISHED ALMOST FIFTEEN YEARS AGO. AND WE'VE ADOPTED AMBITIOUS MANDATES FOR CLEAN VEHICLES AND VEHICLE EMISSIONS REDUCTION TARGETS. SO TO REFLECT THESE NEW REALITIES IT ONLY MAKES SENSE TO MODIFYING THE STATUTE GUIDING THIS PROGRAM TO ENSURE THAT IT REFLECTS OUR GOALS. AND MARKET TRENDS THIS BILL DOES JUST THAT. FOR EXAMPLE THIS BILL WILL ENSURE THAT WE'RE ABLE TO ACCELERATE ZERO EMISSION CAR TRUCK AND BUS ADOPTION. WHICH IS WHY MANY EVEY AND HYDROGEN FUEL CELL TRUCK AND BUS MANUFACTURERS SUPPORT THIS BILL. THIS BILL IS TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL AND FUEL NEUTRAL AND DOES NOT INCLUDE CARVE OUTS FOR SPECIFIC TECHNOLOGIES WHICH THE MAJORITY OF STAKEHOLDERS AGREE IS CRITICAL. THE RECENT AMENDMENTS TAKE AN ADDRESS THE NEED TO ENSURE EQUITABLE ACCESS TO CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE AND CLEAN TRANSPORTATION. BY ENSURING THAT HALF OF PROGRAM FUNDS WILL BENEFIT DISADVANTAGED AND LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES IT'S FOR THESE REASONS WE ARE HAPPY TO SPONSOR THIS BILL. WE'RE COMMITTED TO CONTINUING DISCUSSIONS WITH STAKEHOLDERS TO MAKE FURTHER ENHANCEMENTS WHILE KEEPING THE BILL TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL. THANK YOU AND. WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. PHONE.

THANK YOU. THANK YOU. AND WE HAVE NO FURTHER COMMENT IN QUEUE AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU WE WILL LOOK TO THE GALLERY TO SEE IF THERE'S ANYONE HERE IN PERSON THAT WISHES TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION. DO NOT SEE ANYONE NOR IAN ROOM ONE TWELVE. THEN WE WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY QUESTIONS- SENATOR WHITE COUNTY. YEAH THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I'M- THE STAFF REPORT HIGHLIGHTS ON PAGE FOUR UNDER A POINT NUMBER THREE- PROGRAM OUTCOMES AND POLICIES AND AS OF LAST MAY THEY INDICATE HOW MUCH IS IN REFUELLING INFRASTRUCTURE ALTERNATIVE FUEL VEHICLES AND THEN THEY HAVE ALTERNATIVE FUEL PRODUCTION THAT'S WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO FOCUS IN ON WHAT MY QUESTION IS 20% OF THE MONIES NOW I HAVE BEEN AWARDED TO. ALTERNATIVE FUEL PRODUCTION SO NOW I'M ON THE- PAGE ELEVEN OF THE BILL THIS IS STARTS UP WITH SECTION THREE WHICH- BEGINS WITH THIS INVESTMENT CYCLE IN TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY TWENTY FIVE TALKS ABOUT THE COMMISSION SHALL EXPEND 50% OF THE MONEY IS APPROPRIATED. THROUGH THIS ALTERNATIVE FUEL PUMP PRODUCT PROGRAMS THAT DIRECTLY BENEFIT OR SERVE RESIDENTS A DISADVANTAGE LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES AND LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS AND AT LEAST 50% OF THOSE LOW LOCATION BASED INVESTMENTS THAT CAN BE EXPANDED. IN DISADVANTAGED IN LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES SO I SEE THE VALUE IN THE LOCATION OF ZEV CHARGING STATIONS AND ALL THAT I'M LOOKING AT THE FUEL PRODUCTION BECAUSE AT LEAST. IN THE BAY AREA WE HAVE BECAUSE OF A COASTAL BREEZE WE HAVE A LOT OF AREAS WHERE THEY HAVE A REFINERY THAT DOESN'T ACTUALLY FALL INTO A QUOTE UNQUOTE. ENVIRO SCREEN DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES WERE TRYING TO GET DIFFERENT DIFFERENT DEFINITIONS SO THAT. AND THEN I GUESS AT SOME UNIVERSITIES OR SOMEBODY WHO'S LOOKING TO ALT TO DEVELOP ALTERNATIVE FUELS AND HAS. HAS INVESTED IN ALTERNATIVE FUELS THAT WAS WORKING WITH UC RIVERSIDE OR UC DAVIS FARMERS SAID THAT MIGHT NOT BE LOCATED IN THE QUOTE UNQUOTE. DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES BUT THAT'S THE FIGHT IS DEFINED BY THE BY THE ENVIRO SCREEN SO I'M- I'M WORRIED ABOUT IS THAT GOING TO IT I GUESS EITHER THE BILL WHAT I'M READING IT THIS WILL ASKING QUESTIONS THAT THEY WOULD NOT BE ENTITLED TO ANY OF THIS MONEY FOR THE ALTERNATIVE FUEL PRODUCTION. NOT THE BUT THE LOCATION OF THE THINGS BUT THE ACTUAL PRODUCTION BECAUSE SOME OF THAT STUFF. IS NOT EASY TO MOVE. AND I WOULD WONDER IF THE AUTHOR OR- THE- UPSTART. FOR HILLSIDE FAMILY MEMORY IF WOULD YOU LIKE TO RESPOND TO THAT IT'S A VERY GOOD QUESTION I WOULD ASK DAD TO MEREDITH ALEXANDER WOULD YOU ASSIST US WITH THAT PLEASE. SURE HAPPY TAIL HI AGAIN MEREDITH ALEXANDER FOR CAL STAR- THANK YOU SENATOR MURKOWSKI FOR THOSE QUESTIONS SO. ONE THING OF NOTE IS THAT THE CURRENT 20% REQUIREMENT. IS FOR LIGHT DUTY HYDROGEN FUELING- AND SO FUELING STATION LOCATED IN A DISADVANTAGE FOR LOW INCOME COMMUNITY. WOULD COUNT TOWARDS THAT 50% OF PHYSICAL INVESTMENTS LOCATED IN ONE OF THOSE COMMUNITIES SO. NOTEWORTHY THAT IT IS NOT JUST D. A. SEES AS DEFINED BY CAROLINE VIRUS SCREEN BUT ALSO LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES. AND WE RECOGNIZE THAT NOT ALL- PROGRAM EXPENDITURES YOU KNOW HOW THIS LOCATION BASED ELEMENT. AND SO THAT'S WHY WE'RE GIVING GUIDANCE TO THE COMMISSION BUT IF THIS IS SOME TANGIBLE LOCATION BASED INVESTMENT. BUT YOU LOOK AT ON BALANCE OVER MULTIPLE YEARS PUTTING 50% OF THE FUNDS INTO THOSE COMMUNITIES. SO WE HOPE THAT WILL STRIKE THE RIGHT BALANCE AND ENSURE THAT THOSE REALLY CRITICAL RESEARCH PROGRAMS AT THOSE UNIVERSITIES- THAT AREN'T TANGIBLE LOCATION BASED. WOULDN'T COUNT IN THAT CALCULATION- AND WE'RE ALSO PROVIDING IN THE BILL THAT BOTH THE EXISTING PROGRAM ADVISORY BOARD AND THE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES ADVISORY BOARD TO HELP THE COMMISSION. FURTHER INTERPRET- WHAT. QUALIFIES. FOR BOTH OF THOSE 50% PROVISIONS. OKAY YEAH BECAUSE I MEAN I GET THE HYDROGEN FUEL STATIONS THAT'S ALRIGHT BUT SOME OF THE ACTUAL PRODUCTION AND THAT RESEARCH PORTION OF THE PRODUCTION. I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT ANYBODY WOULD WANT TO STOP RIGHT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEIR CLOTHES AND SO. I FEEL A LITTLE BIT BETTER ON THAT- SINCE. WITH THAT CLARIFICATION AND I HOPE THAT EVERYBODY SEES THAT THAT'S THAT WE DON'T IMPEDE THAT. THE ALTERNATE FUEL PRODUCTION WHICH IS REALLY IMPORTANT FOR US TO MEET. THESE GOALS WHATEVER IT MAY BE. AND THE RESEARCH HAS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT. THANK YOU SENATOR ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. IS THERE A MOTION. SENATOR NEWMAN HAS MOVED- WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE FAMILY MEMBER RALF.

DESPITE THE ADVANCEMENTS IN TECHNOLOGY THE TRANSITION TO ZERO EMISSION DRAYAGE OPERATIONS WILL BE AN UP HILL BATTLE DUE TO THE PRICE DIFFERENTIAL BETWEEN DIESEL AND ZERO EMISSION TRUCKS.PROVIDING FUNDING TO OFFSET THE UP FRONT COSTS WILL BE CRITICAL.

CARBS PROJECT EIGHT HUNDRED AND IT SHOULD HAVE AN A. B. SIXTEEN TWENTY FOUR SEEK TO PROVIDE ESSENTIAL ASSISTANCE THAT IS NEEDED TO CLOSE THIS GAP AND MAKE THE NEW ZERO EMISSION DRAYAGE TRUCKS MORE AFFORDABLE.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR AND SENATORS. THE THIS COMMITTEE IS WELL AWARE OF THE MYRIAD OF WAYS IN WHICH THE DIGITAL DIVIDE HAS MANIFESTED ITSELF THROUGHOUT OUR STATE THIS PAST YEAR. WHETHER IT'S EDUCATION THE DIGITAL MARKETPLACE HEALTH CARE OR ACCESS TO GOVERNMENT SERVICES THE GATEWAY TO FUNDAMENTAL. FUNDAMENTAL RESOURCES IS INCREASINGLY ONLINE. SINCE TAKING OFFICE COMMONSENSE EXPANSION OF BROADBAND ACCESS BEEN HAS BEEN A PRIORITY OF MINE. I'M EXCITED TO BRING THAT WORKING KNOWLEDGE TO THE TABLE AS WE HAVE COLLABORATED BY CAMERA LAKE WITH THE ADMINISTRATION TO CLOSE THE DIGITAL DIVIDE. THE CONCEPT THE DIG ONCE IS NOT A NEW POLICY AREA FOR ME I'M BRINGING THIS PROPOSAL BEFORE YOU AGAIN BECAUSE UNFORTUNATELY SOME OF OUR STATE AGENCIES DO NOT RECOGNIZE THE URGENCY WITH WHICH WE MUST ROLL OUT. CRITICAL BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE. PUT SIMPLY AS WE UPGRADE OUR STATE ROADWAYS WE NEED TO DETERMINE HOW NOT IF BROADBAND IS A PART OF THE IMMINENT INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS. I CAN'T THINK OF A BETTER TIME TO LAY CON DO IT THEN WE HAVE THE GROUND ALREADY OPEN. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SPENDING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON MIDDLE MILE DEPLOYMENT WHICH IS EXCITING. BUT WE DON'T HAVE BUT WE DON'T WE HAVE A FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITY TO MAXIMIZE COST SAVINGS OPPORTUNITIES. IS IT TOO MUCH TO ASK THAT WE GET BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE DEPLOYMENT IN SYNC WITH PLANNED ROAD INFRASTRUCTURE UPGRADES. I'M ASKING FOR SIMPLE PLANNING WHERE STATE AGENCIES WHICH CAN REDUCE THE COST OF BROADBAND DEPLOYMENT BY 90% ACCORDING TO THE FEDERAL HIGHWAY ADMINISTRATION. ON THE LINE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT IS ERICA HOFFMAN WITH THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL BOARDS ASSOCIATION I RESPECTFULLY ASK HERE I GO. THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER- MODERATOR DO HAVE MISS HOFFMAN ON THE LINE.

HERE COMMITTED TO BROADBAND EXPANSION IN CALIFORNIA TO CLOSE THE DIGITAL DIVIDE AND IMPROVE LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALL STUDENTS- OTHER STATED GOALS NAVIGATE EDUCATION IN THE TIME OF THE CALL THAT. THE NEED FOR MORE BROADBAND ACCESS HAS BECOME ABUNDANTLY CLEAR. BROADBAND NETWORKS AND SERVICES ARE CRITICAL FOR EDUCATION BUT ALSO FOR HEALTHCARE TELEMEDICINE. PUBLIC SAFETY AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE WORLD COMMUNITIES IN LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS WITHOUT ACCESS TO HIGH QUALITY BROADBAND. ARE CURRENTLY AT A MEDIA DISADVANTAGED. SCHOOLS CONTINUE WITH VIRTUAL EDUCATION PROGRAM HOMEWORK AND SCHOOL RESEARCH PROJECT THAT ARE BASED ON THE DIGITAL PLATFORM. THOSE IN RURAL COMMUNITIES IN LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS NEED TO BE CONNECTED IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT STUDENTS HAVE ACCESS TO ALL APPROPRIATE EDUCATION PROGRAM. EIGHTY FORTY ONE WOULD ENSURE THAT AREAS WITH LITTLE ACCESS TO NECESSARY BROADBAND ARE PRIORITIZED AND ACCURATE AND UP TO DATE MAPPING OF SERVICES. IN AREAS IN THE STATE WILL ALLOW FOCUS WE PLACE ON THOSE AREAS WHERE SERVICES ARE NEEDED MOST. INCLUDING CONDUIT IN HIGHWAY CONSTRUCTION WILL FURTHER THE EXPANSION OF BOTH MIDDLE MILE AND LAST MILE PROJECT. ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU CONSIDER THE HIGH LEVEL OF HIGHWAY CONSTRUCTION CURRENTLY BEING UNDERTAKEN THROUGHOUT THE STATE. HE AT THE AIRPORT FINDING AND STREAMLINING PROCESSES TO HELP ACCELERATE BROADBAND DEPLOYMENT. IT'S STILL EIGHT INSURING THAT STATE AND FEDERAL BROADBAND FUNDING WILL BENEFIT COMMUNITIES OF NEED AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE FOR THESE REASONS WE ARE DRIVE OUT. ON EIGHTY FORTY ONE THANK YOU.
