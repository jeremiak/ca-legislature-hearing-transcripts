six counties I do have a power

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:51.217
point [inaudible]

00:05:51.284 --> 00:05:53.052
In.

00:05:53.119 --> 00:05:55.021
The city California's you know

00:05:55.088 --> 00:05:57.490
has made a commitment under the

00:05:57.557 --> 00:05:59.025
Lanham act to serve people

00:05:59.092 --> 00:06:01.794
throughout the state California

Rick.

00:06:03.029 --> 00:06:05.932
Com um and so what will into

And their families I'm in other

00:06:15.808 --> 00:06:19.545
states on their thing là this

00:06:19.612 --> 00:06:20.113
other states if you don't

00:06:20.179 --> 00:06:23.149
qualify for Medicaid you don't

00:06:23.216 --> 00:06:23.382
answer.

00:06:23.449 --> 00:06:25.151
Is.

00:06:25.218 --> 00:06:27.920
On your own for families that

00:06:27.987 --> 00:06:31.057
can be very challenging any

00:06:31.124 --> 00:06:37.363
numbers such actions or they can.

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:43.536
One third of many things that

00:06:43.603 --> 00:06:49.442
the rest of us take.

00:06:49.509 --> 00:06:51.878
For the mobile. Seven for

00:06:51.944 --> 00:06:53.546
members developmental

00:06:53.613 --> 00:07:01.521
disabilities.

00:07:01.587 --> 00:07:03.623
Until they got Irwin.

00:07:03.689 --> 00:07:11.497
In and the that's the earn so

00:07:11.564 --> 00:07:13.533
it's crucial.

00:07:13.599 --> 00:07:17.637
Birth out our work that we do

00:07:17.703 --> 00:07:19.539
that.

00:07:19.605 --> 00:07:23.576
Members come from.

00:07:23.643 --> 00:07:24.243
Some members come personal voice

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:29.382
found that we must attend.

00:07:29.448 --> 00:07:37.490
To the service must either it's

00:07:37.557 --> 00:07:41.527
I'm step.

00:07:41.594 --> 00:07:45.498
Those are at stake graphic in

00:07:45.565 --> 00:07:51.470
our area we have steps but not

00:07:51.537 --> 00:07:55.174
often entity.

00:07:55.241 --> 00:07:57.210
Talked with the state not aid in

00:07:57.276 --> 00:07:59.078
teas and the reason for this was

00:07:59.145 --> 00:07:59.645
that we are supposed to be

00:07:59.712 --> 00:08:00.313
nimble and flexible to the needs

00:08:00.379 --> 00:08:01.047
of our community.

00:08:01.113 --> 00:08:03.416
And sometimes people get a

00:08:03.482 --> 00:08:05.484
little frustrated because you go

00:08:05.551 --> 00:08:07.386
between regional centers and

00:08:07.453 --> 00:08:09.088
things might seem a little

00:08:09.155 --> 00:08:09.755
different now services once you

00:08:09.822 --> 00:08:11.524
receive them once you're found

00:08:11.591 --> 00:08:13.392
eligible under the Lanham acts

00:08:13.459 --> 00:08:15.094
so age three and up --

00:08:15.161 --> 00:08:15.595
You should be eligible

00:08:15.661 --> 00:08:17.129
throughout the state your

00:08:17.196 --> 00:08:18.931
services should transfer between

00:08:18.998 --> 00:08:19.332
regional centers.

00:08:19.398 --> 00:08:21.534
In the not so distant past

00:08:21.601 --> 00:08:23.436
regional centers what kind of

00:08:23.502 --> 00:08:25.204
coral or bicker over the money

00:08:25.271 --> 00:08:27.406
following the person and when

00:08:27.473 --> 00:08:28.941
did that money got transferred

00:08:29.008 --> 00:08:29.275
in the state.

00:08:29.342 --> 00:08:31.310
Several years back made a change

00:08:31.377 --> 00:08:33.379
where the regional centers are

00:08:33.446 --> 00:08:33.579
true.

00:08:33.646 --> 00:08:35.248
To at the end of the year so

00:08:35.314 --> 00:08:37.149
they should be no more issues

00:08:37.216 --> 00:08:37.817
around case transfers but I hear

00:08:37.884 --> 00:08:39.318
that there are still some

00:08:39.385 --> 00:08:41.087
challenges along those lines.

00:08:41.153 --> 00:08:43.089
Our philosophy at CRC to the

00:08:43.155 --> 00:08:44.957
greatest extent possible is just

00:08:45.024 --> 00:08:45.558
take the case we need to get

00:08:45.625 --> 00:08:49.028
families part of the services as

00:08:49.095 --> 00:08:51.163
quickly as possible [inaudible]

00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:52.999
I'm.

00:08:53.065 --> 00:08:53.633
In the Central Valley we have

00:08:53.699 --> 00:08:55.534
issues around transportation --

00:08:55.601 --> 00:08:57.503
Lack of social opportunities

00:08:57.570 --> 00:08:59.071
insufficient medical care

00:08:59.138 --> 00:09:01.374
providers are airy our our needs

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:03.175
can be very different from the

00:09:03.242 --> 00:09:05.077
needs of the rest of the state --

00:09:05.144 --> 00:09:07.179
Because we don't have all these

00:09:07.246 --> 00:09:09.181
connective tissue with bus lines

00:09:09.248 --> 00:09:11.217
and and high speed rail yet you

00:09:11.284 --> 00:09:13.085
know these things are coming and

00:09:13.152 --> 00:09:13.619
I know that you're on the

00:09:13.686 --> 00:09:15.288
transportation sub sub committee

00:09:15.354 --> 00:09:17.523
and more to come transportation

00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:19.125
is a huge issue in our area.

00:09:19.191 --> 00:09:21.027
People --

00:09:21.093 --> 00:09:21.594
Assume that we don't have

00:09:21.661 --> 00:09:23.396
housing issues here in the

00:09:23.462 --> 00:09:25.097
valley because we have lots of

00:09:25.164 --> 00:09:25.665
land and because we're a low

00:09:25.731 --> 00:09:27.500
income area but we have very

00:09:27.566 --> 00:09:29.435
similar issues to other parts of

00:09:29.502 --> 00:09:31.070
the state's.

00:09:31.137 --> 00:09:31.637
We have a low capacity for

00:09:31.704 --> 00:09:33.172
housing --

00:09:33.239 --> 00:09:35.207
There is housing that is being

00:09:35.274 --> 00:09:35.875
built for instance in Clovis but

00:09:35.942 --> 00:09:39.111
Fresno had made some changes in

00:09:39.178 --> 00:09:41.447
their housing and redevelopment

00:09:41.514 --> 00:09:41.781
and zoning --

00:09:41.847 --> 00:09:43.549
Look -- More

00:09:43.616 --> 00:09:45.651
to come on that and I know that

00:09:45.718 --> 00:09:47.820
that's not special instead is is

00:09:47.887 --> 00:09:49.722
all [inaudible]

00:09:49.789 --> 00:09:51.524
In.

00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:53.759
Bedroom apartment what washer

00:09:53.826 --> 00:09:57.863
and dryer the going rate the

00:09:57.930 --> 00:09:59.532
theft and Dahle.

00:09:59.598 --> 00:10:01.801
Which is a real I would consider

00:10:01.867 --> 00:10:05.905
once in could be hundreds or

00:10:05.972 --> 00:10:07.573
some.

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:09.976
Maybe nine hundred a month they

00:10:10.042 --> 00:10:11.744
count of for other things if

00:10:11.811 --> 00:10:12.278
trying to buy into a nice

00:10:12.345 --> 00:10:13.579
neighborhood.

00:10:13.646 --> 00:10:15.514
So they often in the

00:10:15.581 --> 00:10:16.082
neighborhoods that are more

00:10:16.148 --> 00:10:19.418
dangerous than they should be.

00:10:19.485 --> 00:10:23.456
If can get in at all because we

00:10:23.522 --> 00:10:25.391
in the back to get your about

00:10:25.458 --> 00:10:29.061
ours than Marler.

00:10:29.128 --> 00:10:31.097
What's in it is --

00:10:31.163 --> 00:10:33.399
So you can see that will talk

00:10:33.466 --> 00:10:35.501
about area Los Angeles there are

00:10:35.568 --> 00:10:37.303
very different than ours if we

00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:39.338
were to look assist as a whole.

00:10:39.405 --> 00:10:42.942
We may miss some of needs

00:10:43.009 --> 00:10:49.115
Central Valley of weren't

00:10:49.181 --> 00:10:51.050
promote independence

00:10:51.117 --> 00:10:53.185
employability care and support --

00:10:53.252 --> 00:10:55.354
We also have to access generic

00:10:55.421 --> 00:10:58.958
services this was an original

00:10:59.025 --> 00:10:59.625
intent of the letterman act that

00:10:59.692 --> 00:11:02.995
service coordination.

00:11:03.062 --> 00:11:05.164
The doctor immune [inaudible]

00:11:05.231 --> 00:11:15.007
Welcome.

00:11:15.074 --> 00:11:17.143
Please proceed thank you.

00:11:17.209 --> 00:11:19.178
I'm generic or services are

00:11:19.245 --> 00:11:19.779
requirement of the regional

00:11:19.845 --> 00:11:23.015
centers to access.

00:11:23.082 --> 00:11:25.418
So first five insurance medi cal

00:11:25.484 --> 00:11:27.186
funded services and school

00:11:27.253 --> 00:11:28.988
districts are things we must

00:11:29.055 --> 00:11:30.990
attend to before we can purchase

00:11:31.057 --> 00:11:32.992
of service --

00:11:33.059 --> 00:11:35.294
And with generic services

00:11:35.361 --> 00:11:37.229
sometimes people get confused

00:11:37.296 --> 00:11:39.165
about those --

00:11:39.231 --> 00:11:41.267
But it will as I said it was an

00:11:41.333 --> 00:11:43.202
original intent of Lanham act

00:11:43.269 --> 00:11:45.171
that the regional centers are

00:11:45.237 --> 00:11:45.838
service coordination entities.

00:11:45.905 --> 00:11:47.406
And that was our first and

00:11:47.473 --> 00:11:48.908
foremost I'm a borrowed from

00:11:48.974 --> 00:11:51.043
Star Trek our prime directive --

00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:53.212
Is service coordination so I

00:11:53.279 --> 00:11:53.846
have a slight later that shows

00:11:53.913 --> 00:11:55.114
you -- From

00:11:55.181 --> 00:11:55.648
the complex systems that

00:11:55.714 --> 00:11:57.416
families have to navigate and

00:11:57.483 --> 00:11:59.185
our job is to try to help them

00:11:59.251 --> 00:12:01.220
navigate complex systems.

00:12:01.287 --> 00:12:03.122
I wanted to bring your attention

00:12:03.189 --> 00:12:05.057
to community access services

00:12:05.124 --> 00:12:07.293
that senior CS engaged in at

00:12:07.359 --> 00:12:07.593
this time.

00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:09.228
We have a promo toward community

00:12:09.295 --> 00:12:11.130
navigator program which is

00:12:11.197 --> 00:12:11.664
working with our Spanish

00:12:11.730 --> 00:12:13.299
speaking among speaking

00:12:13.365 --> 00:12:15.101
communities this is headed up by

00:12:15.167 --> 00:12:17.203
my chief counselor ritual Hagens

00:12:17.269 --> 00:12:19.038
who's in the back --

00:12:19.105 --> 00:12:21.040
And these folks go into the

00:12:21.107 --> 00:12:23.042
homes they talk with the

00:12:23.109 --> 00:12:23.642
families about why they're not

00:12:23.709 --> 00:12:24.977
accessing services and what

00:12:25.044 --> 00:12:25.211
those.

00:12:25.277 --> 00:12:29.381
Challenges are and we're

00:12:29.448 --> 00:12:34.987
learning in some cultures --

00:12:35.054 --> 00:12:39.492
Feel somewhat ashamed perhaps in

00:12:39.558 --> 00:12:40.159
their community to have a family

00:12:40.226 --> 00:12:41.227
member board of the

00:12:41.293 --> 00:12:41.794
developmental disability.

00:12:41.861 --> 00:12:43.295
But we didn't understand then

00:12:43.362 --> 00:12:45.131
the deeper dive was even showing

00:12:45.197 --> 00:12:45.664
up to their house called

00:12:45.731 --> 00:12:47.266
attention to this and if you're

00:12:47.333 --> 00:12:49.201
talking about a clown system for

00:12:49.268 --> 00:12:51.103
instance this could change your

00:12:51.170 --> 00:12:51.604
standing in the clown.

00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:53.506
So it's very complex it's very

00:12:53.572 --> 00:12:55.141
important we have those

00:12:55.207 --> 00:12:57.076
community navigators helping us

00:12:57.143 --> 00:12:58.978
on this is the program for

00:12:59.044 --> 00:12:59.578
center of new Americans that

00:12:59.645 --> 00:13:01.013
we've --

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:03.149
Contracted with.

00:13:03.215 --> 00:13:03.749
I'm wearing gauging in person

00:13:03.816 --> 00:13:05.084
center practices training for

00:13:05.151 --> 00:13:05.618
all staff for our service

00:13:05.684 --> 00:13:06.986
providers families and

00:13:07.052 --> 00:13:09.021
individuals through Michael

00:13:09.088 --> 00:13:09.255
small.

00:13:09.321 --> 00:13:13.492
And I put a under liner rips and

00:13:13.559 --> 00:13:14.160
a river Berman in the back also

00:13:14.226 --> 00:13:17.463
helps us with the project.

00:13:17.530 --> 00:13:21.567
In control compensate for all

00:13:21.634 --> 00:13:23.836
staff at the for service for

00:13:23.903 --> 00:13:25.804
your through doctor Valerie

00:13:25.871 --> 00:13:29.642
about the vision ink we also

00:13:29.708 --> 00:13:31.510
don't ting called.

00:13:31.577 --> 00:13:32.077
Us and try to reach out to

00:13:32.144 --> 00:13:33.913
understand that neighborhoods so

00:13:33.979 --> 00:13:35.414
that we can have direct access

00:13:35.481 --> 00:13:35.948
individuals and families

00:13:36.015 --> 00:13:37.883
research here from their voice

00:13:37.950 --> 00:13:39.552
directly.

00:13:39.618 --> 00:13:41.587
These are just some examples of

00:13:41.654 --> 00:13:49.061
how we're trying dressed in

00:13:49.128 --> 00:13:53.432
meridian arc de.

00:13:53.499 --> 00:13:55.000
These are examples of services

00:13:55.067 --> 00:13:59.338
region centers provide spit care

00:13:59.405 --> 00:14:03.042
in op is Dave programs.

00:14:03.108 --> 00:14:11.817
Of schemes don't center one of

00:14:11.884 --> 00:14:13.752
the things we take pride in an

00:14:13.819 --> 00:14:19.625
at a rain my the mission back

00:14:19.692 --> 00:14:23.462
there.

00:14:23.529 --> 00:14:25.731
Started this night guys so you

00:14:25.798 --> 00:14:27.366
won T..

00:14:27.433 --> 00:14:29.602
Be helpful.

00:14:29.668 --> 00:14:33.839
Answer phones twenty four seven

00:14:33.906 --> 00:14:34.406
so we do not some people to

00:14:34.473 --> 00:14:41.680
voice mail.

00:14:41.747 --> 00:14:45.517
And one of the ages certainly

00:14:45.584 --> 00:14:45.718
made.

00:14:45.784 --> 00:14:49.588
A few to the desk you will be

00:14:49.655 --> 00:14:51.490
routed to a real person for

00:14:51.557 --> 00:14:55.494
intake and assessment this is a

00:14:55.561 --> 00:15:03.535
well known and in some vantage

00:15:03.602 --> 00:15:03.836
of the last.

00:15:03.902 --> 00:15:07.039
Of the in it's a very important.

00:15:07.106 --> 00:15:11.310
And a vote. 7% of the Chau pain

00:15:11.377 --> 00:15:13.212
need services beyond early start

00:15:13.279 --> 00:15:13.812
early intervention which is

00:15:13.879 --> 00:15:14.413
really exciting number that I

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:17.016
just heard from one of our city

00:15:17.082 --> 00:15:19.084
kids Clovis unified partners --

00:15:19.151 --> 00:15:21.320
So I can go into detail with us

00:15:21.387 --> 00:15:22.921
if you would like these are the

00:15:22.988 --> 00:15:23.555
criteria we also have a handout

00:15:23.622 --> 00:15:25.324
that was at the front table for

00:15:25.391 --> 00:15:27.026
what the criteria are.

00:15:27.092 --> 00:15:29.061
Now.

00:15:29.128 --> 00:15:29.662
If you weren't confused before

00:15:29.728 --> 00:15:31.163
for early start here are the

00:15:31.230 --> 00:15:33.465
rules for age three through

00:15:33.532 --> 00:15:35.134
adulthood.

00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:37.069
So once a child begins to turn

00:15:37.136 --> 00:15:38.937
three so you're not quite there

00:15:39.004 --> 00:15:39.238
yet -- We

00:15:39.305 --> 00:15:41.740
start assessing for went but

00:15:41.807 --> 00:15:43.709
what we fondly call Lanham

00:15:43.776 --> 00:15:45.577
eligibility.

00:15:45.644 --> 00:15:46.211
And that's what you're mostly

00:15:46.278 --> 00:15:49.848
clear with up to three calls to

00:15:49.915 --> 00:15:55.587
lex just the in app lapsed and

00:15:55.654 --> 00:15:55.788
then.

00:15:55.854 --> 00:15:59.525
The fifth.

00:15:59.591 --> 00:16:05.130
So there services.

00:16:05.197 --> 00:16:07.166
Persons planes so similar to

00:16:07.232 --> 00:16:09.201
support an election disability.

00:16:09.268 --> 00:16:15.107
Or some some with.

00:16:15.174 --> 00:16:17.209
With [inaudible]

00:16:17.276 --> 00:16:19.044
Ability.

00:16:19.111 --> 00:16:19.712
Do you have to have three out of

00:16:19.778 --> 00:16:21.380
seven what they call stone the

00:16:21.447 --> 00:16:23.349
regulations I hate using this

00:16:23.415 --> 00:16:25.084
term but that's and regulations

00:16:25.150 --> 00:16:25.684
substantially handicapping.

00:16:25.751 --> 00:16:27.386
Conditions which must be met.

00:16:27.453 --> 00:16:29.355
And thirty two thousand three

00:16:29.421 --> 00:16:31.123
legislation you used to be able

00:16:31.190 --> 00:16:31.790
to qualify with to out of seven

00:16:31.857 --> 00:16:32.358
but it was a cost savings

00:16:32.424 --> 00:16:33.392
measure by the state at that

00:16:33.459 --> 00:16:34.026
time to increase the number of

00:16:34.093 --> 00:16:35.194
substantial handicaps you must

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:35.794
have to get into the system.

00:16:35.861 --> 00:16:37.162
Prior to that in two thousand

00:16:37.229 --> 00:16:37.730
two there was a legislative

00:16:37.796 --> 00:16:39.064
change.

00:16:39.131 --> 00:16:39.665
Where the assessment period

00:16:39.732 --> 00:16:41.300
moved from sixty days which was

00:16:41.367 --> 00:16:43.035
the norm for linemen eligibility

00:16:43.102 --> 00:16:45.003
to a hundred and twenty days --

00:16:45.070 --> 00:16:45.604
So these are both cost savings

00:16:45.671 --> 00:16:46.238
motor so sometimes we hear from

00:16:46.305 --> 00:16:47.039
the community the frustration

00:16:47.106 --> 00:16:47.506
around eligibility --

00:16:47.573 --> 00:16:49.441
And we do have a team here --

00:16:49.508 --> 00:16:53.412
Tammy Maranda his here to she's

00:16:53.479 --> 00:16:55.280
our clinical Sir I'm about how

00:16:55.347 --> 00:16:57.015
do you get into the system how

00:16:57.082 --> 00:16:57.249
do you.

00:16:57.316 --> 00:16:59.284
You know how do you how do you

00:16:59.351 --> 00:17:01.186
get found eligible it all starts

00:17:01.253 --> 00:17:02.955
with referral process --

00:17:03.021 --> 00:17:05.257
Robust review of records as many

00:17:05.324 --> 00:17:05.858
records as we can get from

00:17:05.924 --> 00:17:07.359
school systems these sorts of

00:17:07.426 --> 00:17:09.128
things.

00:17:09.194 --> 00:17:09.461
And then --

00:17:09.528 --> 00:17:11.230
If we need to will do our own

00:17:11.296 --> 00:17:12.965
assessment using a psychologist

00:17:13.031 --> 00:17:13.565
and then an interdisciplinary

00:17:13.632 --> 00:17:15.234
team made up of a physician

00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:17.269
psychologist the service

00:17:17.336 --> 00:17:17.936
coordinator at Sutter will make

00:17:18.003 --> 00:17:19.304
on decisions around eligibility

00:17:19.371 --> 00:17:21.340
based on all the afraid of

00:17:21.407 --> 00:17:23.242
available data and information.

00:17:23.308 --> 00:17:25.277
One thing you're probably aware

00:17:25.344 --> 00:17:27.246
of is starting an intake and

00:17:27.312 --> 00:17:29.281
assessment all the way through

00:17:29.348 --> 00:17:31.016
our service provision there's

00:17:31.083 --> 00:17:33.218
always room for AA exceptions

00:17:33.285 --> 00:17:35.087
and be.

00:17:35.154 --> 00:17:37.055
Appeals.

00:17:37.122 --> 00:17:37.623
And we are not opposed to

00:17:37.689 --> 00:17:39.391
appeals in fact sometimes we

00:17:39.458 --> 00:17:39.992
will encourage families to do

00:17:40.058 --> 00:17:41.460
appeals because that will allow

00:17:41.527 --> 00:17:43.629
a judge to make a decision in a

00:17:43.695 --> 00:17:45.063
different direction.

00:17:45.130 --> 00:17:47.032
Than maybe we feel we're allowed

00:17:47.099 --> 00:17:47.633
to do by what's in regulation

00:17:47.699 --> 00:17:49.067
are law.

00:17:49.134 --> 00:17:51.203
But for families that can be a

00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:53.272
burden that's just one more

00:17:53.338 --> 00:17:55.107
thing for them to go through --

00:17:55.174 --> 00:17:57.376
When you know when they're when

00:17:57.443 --> 00:17:59.211
they're trying to get their

00:17:59.278 --> 00:17:59.578
needs met and?

00:17:59.645 --> 00:18:01.180
On for the way the laws are

00:18:01.246 --> 00:18:01.780
written you know but I have

00:18:01.847 --> 00:18:03.315
someone come in with

00:18:03.382 --> 00:18:05.284
schizophrenia and that alone I'm

00:18:05.350 --> 00:18:05.918
not going to be able to serve

00:18:05.984 --> 00:18:07.519
them and that's really hard on

00:18:07.586 --> 00:18:07.853
the family.

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:09.321
They come in and crisis and they

00:18:09.388 --> 00:18:11.223
want us to serve them.

00:18:11.290 --> 00:18:13.225
And we have to tell them now so

00:18:13.292 --> 00:18:15.194
our job is a community is a

00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:17.062
collaborative community in

00:18:17.129 --> 00:18:17.663
partnership with exceptional

00:18:17.729 --> 00:18:19.131
fair parents unlimited.

00:18:19.198 --> 00:18:21.099
And our other community partners

00:18:21.166 --> 00:18:21.700
six EP you exceptional parents

00:18:21.767 --> 00:18:24.970
unlimited as our family resource

00:18:25.037 --> 00:18:26.972
center --

00:18:27.039 --> 00:18:27.673
Hand offs together and make sure

00:18:27.739 --> 00:18:29.475
that people get plugged into the

00:18:29.541 --> 00:18:31.176
services they need so they're

00:18:31.243 --> 00:18:31.743
not just told you're not

00:18:31.810 --> 00:18:33.312
eligible and move on with your

00:18:33.378 --> 00:18:33.512
life.

00:18:33.579 --> 00:18:35.180
And we really try to help

00:18:35.247 --> 00:18:37.049
families are in crisis even if

00:18:37.115 --> 00:18:39.051
we're not that person for on I'm

00:18:39.117 --> 00:18:41.420
these are examples of services

00:18:41.487 --> 00:18:43.388
we provide birth to three I just

00:18:43.455 --> 00:18:45.691
want to draw to your attention

00:18:45.757 --> 00:18:45.858
in.

00:18:45.924 --> 00:18:46.425
Two thousand nine there was

00:18:46.492 --> 00:18:47.693
legislation passed that no

00:18:47.759 --> 00:18:51.530
longer allow us to provide space

00:18:51.597 --> 00:18:53.565
for in some top players.

00:18:53.632 --> 00:18:57.569
Is a full the feet third.

00:18:57.636 --> 00:18:57.803
Member.

00:18:57.870 --> 00:19:01.473
Of baby.

00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:03.575
A ticket their baby in a person

00:19:03.642 --> 00:19:07.679
time I'm not fine out have you

00:19:07.746 --> 00:19:09.481
ever.

00:19:09.548 --> 00:19:13.485
Care take first.

00:19:13.552 --> 00:19:17.489
Family member who maybe wasn't

00:19:17.556 --> 00:19:21.527
hot.

00:19:21.593 --> 00:19:27.533
Or in on this. One when you're.

00:19:27.599 --> 00:19:31.169
In first when you're on the

00:19:31.236 --> 00:19:35.374
phone or seven or take burn out

00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:43.315
they've [inaudible]

00:19:43.382 --> 00:19:45.050
My gosh --

00:19:45.117 --> 00:19:47.252
Formally included in --

00:19:47.319 --> 00:19:48.987
School age --

00:19:49.054 --> 00:19:49.321
Was also --

00:19:49.388 --> 00:19:51.156
Suspended services such as

00:19:51.223 --> 00:19:55.394
social recreation in camp --

00:19:55.460 --> 00:19:56.028
In age twenty three and up we

00:19:56.094 --> 00:19:56.995
work on employability housing

00:19:57.062 --> 00:20:01.033
medical support and quirk.

00:20:01.099 --> 00:20:03.168
That map of telling you about

00:20:03.235 --> 00:20:05.037
earlier to get permission.

00:20:05.103 --> 00:20:06.939
For post this.

00:20:07.005 --> 00:20:09.308
Man this is around.

00:20:09.374 --> 00:20:14.947
She's served area but I'm

00:20:15.013 --> 00:20:19.117
assuming full of comp since the

00:20:19.184 --> 00:20:21.286
fan is half now but it.

00:20:21.353 --> 00:20:24.957
Room regional planner is opposed

00:20:25.023 --> 00:20:27.059
to be to help family now very

00:20:27.125 --> 00:20:29.161
complex systems --

00:20:29.227 --> 00:20:29.861
And you can see when you look at

00:20:29.928 --> 00:20:30.362
the health care systems

00:20:30.429 --> 00:20:31.263
education systems all these

00:20:31.330 --> 00:20:35.467
sorts of things that families

00:20:35.534 --> 00:20:36.134
must get engaged with that this

00:20:36.201 --> 00:20:36.635
can be very complex and

00:20:36.702 --> 00:20:37.169
challenging for them and

00:20:37.235 --> 00:20:37.803
whatever we can do to simplify

00:20:37.869 --> 00:20:41.807
their lives it's really

00:20:41.873 --> 00:20:43.609
imperative --

00:20:43.675 --> 00:20:47.613
So systems challenges in our

00:20:47.679 --> 00:20:51.583
service leader.

00:20:51.650 --> 00:20:54.019
The river centers tomorrow we

00:20:54.086 --> 00:20:56.989
was up for one and all center

00:20:57.055 --> 00:20:59.191
for every million residents so

00:20:59.257 --> 00:21:01.360
we have four regional center

00:21:01.426 --> 00:21:04.997
state and by the math the

00:21:05.063 --> 00:21:07.265
relaxation stopped at twenty one

00:21:07.332 --> 00:21:09.034
each.

00:21:09.101 --> 00:21:09.601
Other's so about services

00:21:09.668 --> 00:21:11.370
service coordination and the

00:21:11.436 --> 00:21:12.004
ability to meet family's needs

00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:13.338
and have time for them you know

00:21:13.405 --> 00:21:15.340
these are some areas that you

00:21:15.407 --> 00:21:17.042
might want to look up.

00:21:17.109 --> 00:21:19.244
Systems challenge an adequately

00:21:19.311 --> 00:21:19.778
funded provider rates the

00:21:19.845 --> 00:21:21.346
provider rate study that's

00:21:21.413 --> 00:21:22.014
upcoming is a great opportunity.

00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:23.148
To look at these sorts of things

00:21:23.215 --> 00:21:23.815
but we've also had rate freezes

00:21:23.882 --> 00:21:25.217
legislative mandates for uniform

00:21:25.283 --> 00:21:27.152
holiday schedules finally called

00:21:27.219 --> 00:21:29.054
forced closure days.

00:21:29.121 --> 00:21:29.588
And half day billing --

00:21:29.655 --> 00:21:31.156
Which has severely impacted our

00:21:31.223 --> 00:21:32.924
providers their ability to hire

00:21:32.991 --> 00:21:33.458
keep and retain staff and

00:21:33.525 --> 00:21:34.960
provide quality services.

00:21:35.027 --> 00:21:37.396
Providers and I also including

00:21:37.462 --> 00:21:38.030
providers to see you know the

00:21:38.096 --> 00:21:39.264
concept of para professionals

00:21:39.331 --> 00:21:39.931
parents are professionals in the

00:21:39.998 --> 00:21:41.299
care of their own children.

00:21:41.366 --> 00:21:43.368
And many of them are highly

00:21:43.435 --> 00:21:44.002
specialized especially in the

00:21:44.069 --> 00:21:44.636
medical and behavioral care of

00:21:44.703 --> 00:21:45.470
their children.

00:21:45.537 --> 00:21:46.104
So there are services that we

00:21:46.171 --> 00:21:49.708
funded that support the family

00:21:49.775 --> 00:21:51.910
reckless and serve as context

00:21:51.977 --> 00:21:57.549
and there's an optional.

00:21:57.616 --> 00:22:01.219
I'm not on the on the phone

00:22:01.286 --> 00:22:10.996
staff in that inch X. retain

00:22:11.063 --> 00:22:11.196
town.

00:22:11.263 --> 00:22:15.100
And for example since and loss

00:22:15.167 --> 00:22:17.335
of the local ability. To provide

00:22:17.402 --> 00:22:19.004
start up monies for creative

00:22:19.071 --> 00:22:21.239
services or just rate for next

00:22:21.306 --> 00:22:23.041
level service.

00:22:23.108 --> 00:22:23.709
Local area challenges here in

00:22:23.775 --> 00:22:25.277
the valley transportation

00:22:25.343 --> 00:22:27.846
accessing costs rural areas have

00:22:27.913 --> 00:22:31.416
limited resources.

00:22:31.483 --> 00:22:33.585
As I said earlier acting

00:22:33.652 --> 00:22:35.587
training [inaudible]

00:22:35.654 --> 00:22:39.057
Personnel also.

00:22:39.124 --> 00:22:43.028
Well in 30% speed occupational

00:22:43.095 --> 00:22:45.063
therapy physical therapy.

00:22:45.130 --> 00:22:47.299
Hi but pretty and in security

00:22:47.365 --> 00:22:49.067
valley.

00:22:49.134 --> 00:22:51.136
And safe and adequate housing I

00:22:51.203 --> 00:22:57.142
addressed a little bit earlier.

00:22:57.209 --> 00:22:59.077
I got a couple more minutes.

00:22:59.144 --> 00:23:01.113
I'm almost done --

00:23:01.179 --> 00:23:01.813
And also the bridge funding that

00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:03.215
was recently up local --

00:23:03.281 --> 00:23:03.849
Providers in this area were

00:23:03.915 --> 00:23:05.350
preemptively excluded --

00:23:05.417 --> 00:23:07.185
I know the decision hasn't been

00:23:07.252 --> 00:23:07.753
fully made yet but at the

00:23:07.819 --> 00:23:09.421
hearing we were told that we

00:23:09.488 --> 00:23:10.088
were being excluded because were

00:23:10.155 --> 00:23:11.256
considered a low cost area.

00:23:11.323 --> 00:23:11.757
But if you look at the

00:23:11.823 --> 00:23:13.225
challenges we face in the valley

00:23:13.291 --> 00:23:13.825
and you accommodate for those

00:23:13.892 --> 00:23:15.360
factors were probably just as

00:23:15.427 --> 00:23:19.030
high cost is up other areas --

00:23:19.097 --> 00:23:21.733
ABA services transition to

00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:23.368
insurance has been a challenge --

00:23:23.435 --> 00:23:25.270
Families are very confused

00:23:25.337 --> 00:23:27.439
around enrollment with insurance

00:23:27.506 --> 00:23:31.409
which providers are in network.

00:23:31.476 --> 00:23:32.077
And the things that we use to

00:23:32.144 --> 00:23:35.147
rape working with our providers

00:23:35.213 --> 00:23:37.048
within the regional centers pay

00:23:37.115 --> 00:23:39.117
their bills on time a lot of our

00:23:39.184 --> 00:23:41.253
providers have billing

00:23:41.319 --> 00:23:43.054
department now.

00:23:43.121 --> 00:23:45.791
And don't get their paid on time

00:23:45.857 --> 00:23:46.358
for the insurance companies

00:23:46.424 --> 00:23:47.659
staffing crisis I've touched on

00:23:47.726 --> 00:23:49.728
a little bit earlier --

00:23:49.795 --> 00:23:51.663
Touch trusted staffer leaving

00:23:51.730 --> 00:23:53.598
rage compression --

00:23:53.665 --> 00:23:55.567
And providers not of the pay

00:23:55.634 --> 00:23:56.234
directs this professionals more

00:23:56.301 --> 00:23:59.638
than minimum wage so they're

00:23:59.704 --> 00:24:03.775
leaving for and number and stuff

00:24:03.842 --> 00:24:07.746
ox care take is used.

00:24:07.813 --> 00:24:11.049
As a trusted spit opportunities

00:24:11.116 --> 00:24:13.518
and not all families could

00:24:13.585 --> 00:24:15.387
depress but on a monthly basis

00:24:15.453 --> 00:24:15.887
but that one time --

00:24:15.954 --> 00:24:17.255
For two weeks was very helpful

00:24:17.322 --> 00:24:17.622
for families --

00:24:17.689 --> 00:24:18.957
And also reduce unnecessary

00:24:19.024 --> 00:24:19.624
administrative burdens I've read

00:24:19.691 --> 00:24:21.193
through the latest a hundred and

00:24:21.259 --> 00:24:23.028
fifty trailer bill since two

00:24:23.094 --> 00:24:23.695
thousand eight line by line and

00:24:23.762 --> 00:24:25.397
there's a lot of room I think

00:24:25.463 --> 00:24:29.167
they're for change --

00:24:29.234 --> 00:24:29.768
Keep DC closure money in the

00:24:29.835 --> 00:24:31.770
community based system I know

00:24:31.837 --> 00:24:33.638
this is been a hot topic over

00:24:33.705 --> 00:24:35.507
the last while we have portable

00:24:35.574 --> 00:24:39.578
mental center own backyard.

00:24:39.644 --> 00:24:41.513
In her --

00:24:41.580 --> 00:24:43.148
All done with our Xin the Jack

00:24:43.215 --> 00:24:45.584
treatment closure.

00:24:45.650 --> 00:24:47.853
On but many follow a certain

00:24:47.919 --> 00:24:50.989
person follow vigils challenging

00:24:51.056 --> 00:24:55.060
needs but it would be nice for

00:24:55.126 --> 00:24:59.564
to come to this around in the

00:24:59.631 --> 00:25:01.566
job find.

00:25:01.633 --> 00:25:05.537
Stop at some of these --

00:25:05.604 --> 00:25:07.539
Cost thing that.

00:25:07.606 --> 00:25:09.274
That would address some of these

00:25:09.341 --> 00:25:09.875
issues I brought up earlier.

00:25:09.941 --> 00:25:11.309
System solutions fully fine

00:25:11.376 --> 00:25:13.345
staffing and other crucial rates

00:25:13.411 --> 00:25:17.182
the rate study is an opportunity --

00:25:17.249 --> 00:25:19.217
Allow regional is once again to

00:25:19.284 --> 00:25:21.419
address crucial rates it tears

00:25:21.486 --> 00:25:23.188
up local.

00:25:23.255 --> 00:25:27.092
Full funds.

00:25:27.158 --> 00:25:31.329
Refresh [inaudible]

00:25:31.396 --> 00:25:31.663

Collaboration is crucial it's

00:25:33.531 --> 00:25:34.032
really imperative to do is

have a responsibility as a

00:25:57.155 --> 00:25:58.990
parent professional myself and

00:25:59.057 --> 00:26:01.393

Because oftentimes our voices in

00:26:21.579 --> 00:26:23.415
the Central Valley are not heard

00:26:23.481 --> 00:26:26.985

00:27:53.238 --> 00:27:55.140
chairing the select committee

00:27:55.206 --> 00:27:57.042
first and foremost and also for

00:27:57.108 --> 00:27:57.675
having these listening sessions

00:27:57.742 --> 00:27:59.010

00:28:01.613 --> 00:28:03.148
to support us.

00:28:03.214 --> 00:28:03.848
I'm it's again like heather said

00:28:03.915 --> 00:28:05.283
it's just great to have you here

00:28:05.350 --> 00:28:06.985
in Fresno and thank you amber

00:28:07.052 --> 00:28:07.585
was in joint meeting with you

00:28:07.652 --> 00:28:09.187
and talking --

00:28:09.254 --> 00:28:11.222
I think I'll take less time so

00:28:11.289 --> 00:28:13.058
we can get caught up quick --

00:28:13.124 --> 00:28:14.993
Saw many hit my timer --

00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:15.593
So first of all and executive

00:28:15.660 --> 00:28:19.431
director twenty eight years I've

00:28:19.497 --> 00:28:21.232
been executive director for

00:28:21.299 --> 00:28:23.101
twenty of those years and I know

00:28:23.168 --> 00:28:25.003
that the lord above has blessed

00:28:25.070 --> 00:28:25.670
me with this job and I feel so.

00:28:25.737 --> 00:28:27.338
Privileged to work for people

00:28:27.405 --> 00:28:27.972
with developmental disabilities

00:28:28.039 --> 00:28:29.040
first and foremost.

00:28:29.107 --> 00:28:31.309
I'm and I'm here tonight

00:28:31.376 --> 00:28:33.244
strictly for them --

00:28:33.311 --> 00:28:35.080
To share with you --

00:28:35.146 --> 00:28:37.015
Wonderful things that we're

00:28:37.082 --> 00:28:37.582
doing in the community as

00:28:37.649 --> 00:28:39.250
service providers but many of

00:28:39.317 --> 00:28:39.884
the struggles that were having

00:28:39.951 --> 00:28:41.486
and so the very first thing that

00:28:41.553 --> 00:28:43.354
I I could just say in publicidad

00:28:43.421 --> 00:28:45.256
on would be insufficient funding.

00:28:45.323 --> 00:28:47.025
If we just stop there and more

00:28:47.092 --> 00:28:47.725
money came our way would be very

00:28:47.792 --> 00:28:49.327
helpful to address many of our

00:28:49.394 --> 00:28:51.062
issues and concerns.

00:28:51.129 --> 00:28:52.931
The main thing --

00:28:52.997 --> 00:28:53.631
I've been around long enough to

00:28:53.698 --> 00:28:55.133
know that the rates been frozen

00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:57.335
twenty plus years and is some of

00:28:57.402 --> 00:28:57.902
my peers will remember there

00:28:57.969 --> 00:28:59.471
were cost statements at the time

00:28:59.537 --> 00:29:01.439
the DDS would require from us.

00:29:01.506 --> 00:29:03.174
And you centers in every two

00:29:03.241 --> 00:29:03.775
years and they were actual

00:29:03.842 --> 00:29:05.376
dollars that you spent and then

00:29:05.443 --> 00:29:07.178
you've got a rate to meet your

00:29:07.245 --> 00:29:07.846
needs to keep doing this service

00:29:07.912 --> 00:29:11.149
will that was frozen in nineteen

00:29:11.216 --> 00:29:11.749
ninety eight we have had to

00:29:11.816 --> 00:29:13.118
increases that were --

00:29:13.184 --> 00:29:15.120
Primarily for wage pass through

00:29:15.186 --> 00:29:15.787
which is desperately needed to

00:29:15.854 --> 00:29:17.422
paid staff her doing this work

00:29:17.489 --> 00:29:20.992
hands on so we did have money

00:29:21.059 --> 00:29:22.994
I'm about to year goes with the

00:29:23.061 --> 00:29:23.328
AB two X. --

00:29:23.394 --> 00:29:25.263
One dollars there were one time

00:29:25.330 --> 00:29:29.067
in -- Two

00:29:29.134 --> 00:29:29.701
thousand four one of the things

00:29:29.767 --> 00:29:29.934
that --

00:29:30.001 --> 00:29:31.169
Heather brought up is about and

00:29:31.236 --> 00:29:33.304
we're thankful there three left

00:29:33.371 --> 00:29:35.306
and we agreed that the hundred

00:29:35.373 --> 00:29:37.142
plus million dollars that we

00:29:37.208 --> 00:29:39.144
believe the state would save --

00:29:39.210 --> 00:29:39.744
Every year after the closure

00:29:39.811 --> 00:29:41.412
will lead to should go back into

00:29:41.479 --> 00:29:43.081
the system that serves the

00:29:43.148 --> 00:29:43.681
people that were serving three

00:29:43.748 --> 00:29:45.383
earned thirty thousand plus

00:29:45.450 --> 00:29:47.085
people in California --

00:29:47.152 --> 00:29:49.487
So one of the biggest things

00:29:49.554 --> 00:29:49.888
with staffing --

00:29:49.954 --> 00:29:50.121
With --

00:29:50.188 --> 00:29:51.356
Funding being so tough is that

00:29:51.422 --> 00:29:53.358
we are having a much harder time

00:29:53.424 --> 00:29:55.226
now attracting qualified staff.

00:29:55.293 --> 00:29:57.061
And right now --

00:29:57.128 --> 00:29:59.230
On any given day you at our

00:29:59.297 --> 00:30:01.266
agency we serve a six hundred

00:30:01.332 --> 00:30:03.101
and thirty five adults --

00:30:03.168 --> 00:30:03.701
And we do it with two hundred

00:30:03.768 --> 00:30:05.336
staff and we usually have

00:30:05.403 --> 00:30:07.305
between seven and ten positions

00:30:07.372 --> 00:30:09.140
open at any given time.

00:30:09.207 --> 00:30:11.075
And to so that causes a real

00:30:11.142 --> 00:30:11.676
problem with ratios you're

00:30:11.743 --> 00:30:13.344
supposed to required to have so

00:30:13.411 --> 00:30:15.046
many staff for pretty clients

00:30:15.113 --> 00:30:15.413
you're serving.

00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:17.182
And that makes very hard so and

00:30:17.248 --> 00:30:19.184
now we're learning because

00:30:19.250 --> 00:30:21.252
minimum wage we all agree people

00:30:21.319 --> 00:30:23.054
deserve to make more money --

00:30:23.121 --> 00:30:23.688
To living out there is getting

00:30:23.755 --> 00:30:25.089
tough -- But

00:30:25.156 --> 00:30:27.559
the people are now leaving for

00:30:27.625 --> 00:30:29.194
jobs that are they concert to be

00:30:29.260 --> 00:30:31.062
a much less stressful job I was

00:30:31.129 --> 00:30:33.198
at a restaurant recently and I

00:30:33.264 --> 00:30:33.798
had the gumption to actually

00:30:33.865 --> 00:30:35.500
asked the waitress because she

00:30:35.567 --> 00:30:35.800
seems so.

00:30:35.867 --> 00:30:39.204
Knowledgeable about her job and

00:30:39.270 --> 00:30:41.172
very good which is about me

00:30:41.239 --> 00:30:45.009
disabled adults and really since

00:30:45.076 --> 00:30:47.045
it's a lot less stress.

00:30:47.111 --> 00:30:49.013
Is like wow you know I couldn't

00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:49.614
even convince somebody in a

00:30:49.681 --> 00:30:51.082
restaurant to maybe consider to

00:30:51.149 --> 00:30:53.017
help a human being and services

00:30:53.084 --> 00:30:53.618
and so that's a sign of our

00:30:53.685 --> 00:30:55.153
times -- So

00:30:55.220 --> 00:30:57.355
that's what's probably the

00:30:57.422 --> 00:30:57.655
biggest --

00:30:57.722 --> 00:30:59.490
Hurdle for many of our providers

00:30:59.557 --> 00:31:01.426
I'm only speaking for they are

00:31:01.492 --> 00:31:03.027
tonight but for most of the

00:31:03.094 --> 00:31:03.528
providers are here --

00:31:03.595 --> 00:31:05.296
They experience the same thing

00:31:05.363 --> 00:31:07.232
minimum wage going up in 202075%

00:31:07.298 --> 00:31:09.367
of our staff will be a minimum

00:31:09.434 --> 00:31:11.536
wage and all other wages will

00:31:11.603 --> 00:31:13.271
have collapsed we will be almost

00:31:13.338 --> 00:31:15.073
on the same all of our fifteen

00:31:15.139 --> 00:31:17.041
sixteen your employees or more

00:31:17.108 --> 00:31:17.308
will be.

00:31:17.375 --> 00:31:19.310
At the same level and so that's

00:31:19.377 --> 00:31:21.012
gonna be a huge --

00:31:21.079 --> 00:31:22.947
Concern for us --

00:31:23.014 --> 00:31:25.149
Because we're gonna lose a lot

00:31:25.216 --> 00:31:25.750
of staff they're going to move

00:31:25.817 --> 00:31:27.185
on to other jobs --

00:31:27.252 --> 00:31:29.187
Were concerned a better quality

00:31:29.254 --> 00:31:29.721
of services can be very

00:31:29.787 --> 00:31:32.957
challenging we expect outcomes

00:31:33.024 --> 00:31:33.558
for individuals there's goals

00:31:33.625 --> 00:31:35.393
and objectives that need to be

00:31:35.460 --> 00:31:35.660
tracked.

00:31:35.727 --> 00:31:37.362
And we're going to be concerned

00:31:37.428 --> 00:31:39.063
about the revolving door staff

00:31:39.130 --> 00:31:40.965
there's no continuity then in

00:31:41.032 --> 00:31:41.599
the service when you deal with

00:31:41.666 --> 00:31:43.001
people with disabilities.

00:31:43.067 --> 00:31:45.203
And so with constant changing of

00:31:45.270 --> 00:31:47.038
staff gives no consistency or

00:31:47.105 --> 00:31:47.739
care of support of the people we

00:31:47.805 --> 00:31:49.574
serve and that's public the most

00:31:49.641 --> 00:31:51.042
concerning to me --

00:31:51.109 --> 00:31:53.077
We are always juggling every

00:31:53.144 --> 00:31:55.146
single day to you --

00:31:55.213 --> 00:31:57.282
Plug the holes in the boat that

00:31:57.348 --> 00:31:57.849
feels like the waters just

00:31:57.915 --> 00:32:01.019
pouring out everywhere --

00:32:01.085 --> 00:32:01.619
It's just gonna get worse the

00:32:01.686 --> 00:32:03.288
next couple years it seems kind

00:32:03.354 --> 00:32:05.456
of I'm kind of on you know

00:32:05.523 --> 00:32:07.158
twenty years I'm kind on the

00:32:07.225 --> 00:32:09.027
downhill slide of my career here

00:32:09.093 --> 00:32:11.129
and it's just really I'm.

00:32:11.195 --> 00:32:13.164
Disheartening to see what's

00:32:13.231 --> 00:32:15.099
happening to the system so --

00:32:15.166 --> 00:32:17.168
So then on top of this of the

00:32:17.235 --> 00:32:17.502
funding -- I

00:32:17.568 --> 00:32:19.037
want to stick with that because

00:32:19.103 --> 00:32:19.671
and you know unfortunately DDS

00:32:19.737 --> 00:32:21.406
we did have I know recession

00:32:21.472 --> 00:32:23.241
cuts that we needed to take in

00:32:23.308 --> 00:32:25.176
two thousand eight nine and ten

00:32:25.243 --> 00:32:25.610
I believe it was.

00:32:25.677 --> 00:32:27.478
And but the state has totally

00:32:27.545 --> 00:32:29.380
turned around we understand

00:32:29.447 --> 00:32:31.149
governor brown has done some

00:32:31.215 --> 00:32:33.151
great job and putting like nine

00:32:33.217 --> 00:32:35.119
billion dollars in rainy day

00:32:35.186 --> 00:32:35.620
funds which is great.

00:32:35.687 --> 00:32:37.155
But when in our system when

00:32:37.221 --> 00:32:39.157
we're now hit with half day

00:32:39.223 --> 00:32:41.125
billing and with more for more

00:32:41.192 --> 00:32:43.027
closure days --

00:32:43.094 --> 00:32:45.463
That's a hundred sixty thousand

00:32:45.530 --> 00:32:46.130
dollars or agency that's not a

00:32:46.197 --> 00:32:47.198
little small amount of money to

00:32:47.265 --> 00:32:49.033
us -- And so

00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:51.069
that's really --

00:32:51.135 --> 00:32:51.736
A little overwhelming when you

00:32:51.803 --> 00:32:53.304
know the state does have nine

00:32:53.371 --> 00:32:55.139
billion dollars and rainy day

00:32:55.206 --> 00:32:55.440
funds -- I

00:32:55.506 --> 00:32:57.208
and I think people with

00:32:57.275 --> 00:32:59.177
development disabilities are

00:32:59.243 --> 00:32:59.677
very deserving of every

00:32:59.744 --> 00:33:01.245
opportunity life that you and I

00:33:01.312 --> 00:33:01.579
are in so.

00:33:01.646 --> 00:33:03.514
That we have to go through these --

00:33:03.581 --> 00:33:07.352
May through is very I'm

00:33:07.418 --> 00:33:09.053
upsetting --

00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:09.654
One of the other things to is

00:33:09.721 --> 00:33:11.456
when we run these agencies we

00:33:11.522 --> 00:33:13.257
are a nonprofit we've been on a

00:33:13.324 --> 00:33:15.059
five oh one see --

00:33:15.126 --> 00:33:15.626
Three but we were very lean

00:33:15.693 --> 00:33:17.195
administration group so it

00:33:17.261 --> 00:33:19.097
because it takes people to

00:33:19.163 --> 00:33:19.731
manage the people that manage

00:33:19.797 --> 00:33:21.265
the direct care staff.

00:33:21.332 --> 00:33:23.368
I'm we have the same needs of

00:33:23.434 --> 00:33:25.103
corporate --

00:33:25.169 --> 00:33:27.071
Businesses and technically I

00:33:27.138 --> 00:33:29.173
could use at least four or five

00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:31.142
more on lead manager and

00:33:31.209 --> 00:33:33.177
director positions to help us

00:33:33.244 --> 00:33:33.811
keep doing what we're doing to

00:33:33.878 --> 00:33:35.113
keep the doors open to help.

00:33:35.179 --> 00:33:37.014
The direct care staff --

00:33:37.081 --> 00:33:39.217
But I just recently have two

00:33:39.283 --> 00:33:43.054
openings for manager jobs and

00:33:43.121 --> 00:33:43.654
three people that applied for

00:33:43.721 --> 00:33:45.123
the jobs when we told with the

00:33:45.189 --> 00:33:47.125
salary was declined immediately --

00:33:47.191 --> 00:33:49.293
And so we don't have a long line

00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:51.028
at the door to come in and and

00:33:51.095 --> 00:33:51.696
do the jobs in the services that

00:33:51.763 --> 00:33:53.164
we want to offer.

00:33:53.231 --> 00:33:55.199
And so -- It

00:33:55.266 --> 00:33:56.968
just seems like every day

00:33:57.034 --> 00:33:57.602
there's just another obstacle

00:33:57.668 --> 00:34:00.972
another roadblock to giving good

00:34:01.038 --> 00:34:01.639
quality services to people with

00:34:01.706 --> 00:34:03.040
disabilities --

00:34:03.107 --> 00:34:05.376
Another thing that is happening

00:34:05.443 --> 00:34:07.044
is transportation is --

00:34:07.111 --> 00:34:09.180
An issue the federal government

00:34:09.247 --> 00:34:11.149
expects --

00:34:11.215 --> 00:34:13.050
More community Gration with two

00:34:13.117 --> 00:34:15.052
thousand twenty two I'm from the

00:34:15.119 --> 00:34:19.190
five of our five in the

00:34:19.257 --> 00:34:21.392
community we do integrate --

00:34:21.459 --> 00:34:25.029
But for us to get more based on

00:34:25.096 --> 00:34:27.098
with them CMS rules looking for

00:34:27.165 --> 00:34:29.033
we need bunch on many more staff

00:34:29.100 --> 00:34:31.102
and vehicles --

00:34:31.169 --> 00:34:31.803
And so one of the things that I

00:34:31.869 --> 00:34:33.438
want to share with you was that --

00:34:33.504 --> 00:34:35.506
I did a quick analysis of those

00:34:35.573 --> 00:34:37.341
four five positions and if I put

00:34:37.408 --> 00:34:39.310
how many vehicles I need to get

00:34:39.377 --> 00:34:41.078
out and I need staff.

00:34:41.145 --> 00:34:41.746
And if we were to pay them the

00:34:41.813 --> 00:34:45.116
right salaries to do the jobs it

00:34:45.183 --> 00:34:47.185
would require 2225% increase and

00:34:47.251 --> 00:34:49.086
then of course the bumps up the

00:34:49.153 --> 00:34:51.088
different levels as we go up.

00:34:51.155 --> 00:34:53.124
My agency alone almost needs to

00:34:53.191 --> 00:34:55.159
million dollars more a year to

00:34:55.226 --> 00:34:57.028
do everything sufficiently and

00:34:57.094 --> 00:34:58.996
meet all those needs.

00:34:59.063 --> 00:35:01.399
And so on were just --

00:35:01.466 --> 00:35:03.334
Not sure winner if that money

00:35:03.401 --> 00:35:06.971
will be coming so I'm the other

00:35:07.038 --> 00:35:08.973
thing is that --

00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:11.242
The we offer work activity

00:35:11.309 --> 00:35:13.177
programs and there's been a lot

00:35:13.244 --> 00:35:15.179
of concern about --

00:35:15.246 --> 00:35:17.315
How valid those are and if we

00:35:17.381 --> 00:35:19.250
should be looking at closing

00:35:19.317 --> 00:35:20.985
those and we believe that every

00:35:21.052 --> 00:35:21.619
individual deserves an operate

00:35:21.686 --> 00:35:23.421
shoot for employment wherever

00:35:23.488 --> 00:35:25.456
they see fit that's their choice?

00:35:25.523 --> 00:35:27.391
And we want to make sure that

00:35:27.458 --> 00:35:29.327
the state does not consider

00:35:29.393 --> 00:35:31.295
closing any kind of options that

00:35:31.362 --> 00:35:31.863
are out there in that are

00:35:31.929 --> 00:35:33.030
available.

00:35:33.097 --> 00:35:33.564
And so we want to really

00:35:33.631 --> 00:35:37.001
encourage you to talk to others

00:35:37.068 --> 00:35:37.602
about employment opportunities

00:35:37.668 --> 00:35:39.237
for our clients and making sure

00:35:39.303 --> 00:35:43.107
that all options are out there

00:35:43.174 --> 00:35:43.674
for them that we don't close

00:35:43.741 --> 00:35:43.941
anything.

00:35:44.008 --> 00:35:45.042
I'm.

00:35:45.109 --> 00:35:47.211
I think the last thing that I

00:35:47.278 --> 00:35:47.678
want to say is that --

00:35:47.745 --> 00:35:49.447
So we work really hard to meet

00:35:49.514 --> 00:35:51.449
the needs of the families in the

00:35:51.516 --> 00:35:53.251
individuals we serve and we take

00:35:53.317 --> 00:35:54.986
this job so seriously.

00:35:55.052 --> 00:35:58.956
And that we want to do more and

00:35:59.023 --> 00:35:59.390
better for them --

00:35:59.457 --> 00:36:01.259
But right now we are being

00:36:01.325 --> 00:36:03.427
stranglehold but also by a lot

00:36:03.494 --> 00:36:07.164
of regulatory constraints also

00:36:07.231 --> 00:36:09.300
problematic for us it's amazing

00:36:09.367 --> 00:36:11.135
the amount of documentation and

00:36:11.202 --> 00:36:13.037
audits and reviews and

00:36:13.104 --> 00:36:14.972
everything that we go through on

00:36:15.039 --> 00:36:15.606
top of it feels like some days

00:36:15.673 --> 00:36:17.275
we don't even get to talk.

00:36:17.341 --> 00:36:17.942
Or touch the individual we're so

00:36:18.009 --> 00:36:21.245
busy meeting regulatory things

00:36:21.312 --> 00:36:23.147
and so -- We

00:36:23.214 --> 00:36:23.748
can use some real relief and

00:36:23.814 --> 00:36:25.249
that -- And

00:36:25.316 --> 00:36:27.184
so.

00:36:27.251 --> 00:36:28.986
I have many new ideas and things

00:36:29.053 --> 00:36:29.387
that we could --

00:36:29.453 --> 00:36:31.222
Suggests that could be looked at

00:36:31.289 --> 00:36:33.057
and would like to submit that to

00:36:33.124 --> 00:36:34.992
both later at another time but

00:36:35.059 --> 00:36:37.161
in closing I just would really

00:36:37.228 --> 00:36:37.495
implore you.

00:36:37.562 --> 00:36:40.998
To think about the funding first

00:36:41.065 --> 00:36:43.000

00:38:19.730 --> 00:38:23.100
program for children with autism.

00:38:23.167 --> 00:38:25.202
And I also oversee engine

00:38:25.269 --> 00:38:27.071
services for individuals with

00:38:27.138 --> 00:38:29.206
developmental disabilities other

00:38:29.273 --> 00:38:31.175
than autism of all ages --

00:38:31.242 --> 00:38:33.477
I also my parent professional

00:38:33.544 --> 00:38:35.413
have twelve children.

00:38:35.479 --> 00:38:37.314
And and seven of them have

00:38:37.381 --> 00:38:39.116
physical disabilities and one is

00:38:39.183 --> 00:38:39.684
an adult with intellectual

00:38:39.750 --> 00:38:41.352
disabilities so I do understand

00:38:41.419 --> 00:38:43.521
that and appreciate the unique

00:38:43.587 --> 00:38:45.022
challenge of obtaining.

00:38:45.089 --> 00:38:46.991
Services for individuals

00:38:47.058 --> 00:38:48.993
especially adults with

00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:51.028
developmental disabilities.

00:38:51.095 --> 00:38:53.297
An first I just wanted to talk a

00:38:53.364 --> 00:38:54.999
little bit about what ABA is ABA

00:38:55.066 --> 00:38:55.599
that acronym applied behavior

00:38:55.666 --> 00:38:57.034
analysis.

00:38:57.101 --> 00:38:59.070
Be here now is this is the

00:38:59.136 --> 00:39:01.205
science of behavior which is a

00:39:01.272 --> 00:39:01.472
history.

00:39:01.539 --> 00:39:03.174
Has a history extending back to

00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:05.042
the early twentieth century.

00:39:05.109 --> 00:39:05.676
Its underlying philosophy is

00:39:05.743 --> 00:39:07.344
behaviorism which is based on

00:39:07.411 --> 00:39:09.346
the premise that attempting to

00:39:09.413 --> 00:39:11.115
improve the human condition be

00:39:11.182 --> 00:39:13.484
he is three behavior change.

00:39:13.551 --> 00:39:15.453
I'm basic behavior analytics

00:39:15.519 --> 00:39:15.986
scientists have conducted

00:39:16.053 --> 00:39:17.421
thousands of studies to identify

00:39:17.488 --> 00:39:19.423
the laws of behavior and the

00:39:19.490 --> 00:39:19.990
predictable ways in which

00:39:20.057 --> 00:39:23.060
behaviors learned and how to

00:39:23.127 --> 00:39:23.527
change it over time.

00:39:23.594 --> 00:39:25.262
The underlying theme of much

00:39:25.329 --> 00:39:27.164
work has been that behavior is a

00:39:27.231 --> 00:39:27.765
product of its circumstances

00:39:27.832 --> 00:39:29.400
particularly the events that

00:39:29.467 --> 00:39:31.335
immediately follow the behavior.

00:39:31.402 --> 00:39:33.404
Supplied behavior analysis

00:39:33.471 --> 00:39:35.039
analysts have been using the

00:39:35.106 --> 00:39:35.706
information to develop numerous

00:39:35.773 --> 00:39:37.308
techniques and treatment

00:39:37.374 --> 00:39:39.176
approaches for analyzing and

00:39:39.243 --> 00:39:41.178
changing behavior and ultimately

00:39:41.245 --> 00:39:41.579
to improve lives.

00:39:41.645 --> 00:39:43.447
Because this approach is largely

00:39:43.514 --> 00:39:45.282
based on behavior and its

00:39:45.349 --> 00:39:46.984
consequences the techniques

00:39:47.051 --> 00:39:47.551
generally involve teaching

00:39:47.618 --> 00:39:49.487
individuals more effective ways

00:39:49.553 --> 00:39:51.288
of behaving in making changes to

00:39:51.355 --> 00:39:53.190
social consequences of existing

00:39:53.257 --> 00:40:05.035
behavior.

00:40:05.102 --> 00:40:05.636
AB Aizen Pericles shown to be

00:40:05.703 --> 00:40:06.270
effective in a wide variety of

00:40:06.337 --> 00:40:06.937
areas including parent training.

00:40:07.004 --> 00:40:07.471
Substance abuse treatment

00:40:07.538 --> 00:40:08.139
dementia management brain injury

00:40:08.205 --> 00:40:08.706
rehabilitation occupational

00:40:08.773 --> 00:40:09.306
safety intervention and among

00:40:09.373 --> 00:40:09.907
others however because ABA was

00:40:09.974 --> 00:40:11.008
first applied to the treatment

00:40:11.075 --> 00:40:11.642
of individuals with intellectual

00:40:11.709 --> 00:40:13.244
disabilities and autism.

00:40:13.310 --> 00:40:15.279
This is the practice that is

00:40:15.346 --> 00:40:17.081
most largely evidence based and

00:40:17.148 --> 00:40:17.548
has received the most

00:40:17.615 --> 00:40:19.049
recognition.

00:40:19.116 --> 00:40:21.452
Am I work for holding back

00:40:21.519 --> 00:40:23.053
behavioral health we've been a

00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:23.654
provider here in the Central

00:40:23.721 --> 00:40:27.091
Valley for over thirty years --

00:40:27.158 --> 00:40:29.293
We provide individual

00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:31.061
assessments and we decide design

00:40:31.128 --> 00:40:32.997
individual intervention to

00:40:33.063 --> 00:40:35.266
address the specific needs of

00:40:35.332 --> 00:40:35.866
families in our community we

00:40:35.933 --> 00:40:39.103
help increase behaviors such as

00:40:39.170 --> 00:40:41.138
language acquisition cooperation.

00:40:41.205 --> 00:40:41.739
Pre academic readiness toilet

00:40:41.806 --> 00:40:45.342
training self management other

00:40:45.409 --> 00:40:47.478
socially valued behaviors we

00:40:47.545 --> 00:40:49.346
also said assist with the

00:40:49.413 --> 00:40:51.382
reduction of behavior such as

00:40:51.448 --> 00:40:53.417
aggression or self injurious

00:40:53.484 --> 00:40:53.684
behavior.

00:40:53.751 --> 00:40:55.386
We help people throughout their

00:40:55.452 --> 00:40:57.021
lives is needed addressing the

00:40:57.087 --> 00:40:57.588
unique challenges faced by

00:40:57.655 --> 00:41:01.125
individuals.

00:41:01.192 --> 00:41:01.759
Like children teens and adults.

00:41:01.826 --> 00:41:04.995
Our early intervention services

00:41:05.062 --> 00:41:07.131
for young children with autism.

00:41:07.198 --> 00:41:09.233
And when I first started in the

00:41:09.300 --> 00:41:11.402
field this is not a service that

00:41:11.468 --> 00:41:11.735
was covered.

00:41:11.802 --> 00:41:15.005
By the regional centers by

00:41:15.072 --> 00:41:17.007
insurance it wasn't recognized

00:41:17.074 --> 00:41:19.009
as something that was vital --

00:41:19.076 --> 00:41:21.145
And since it is now and funded

00:41:21.212 --> 00:41:23.347
through the Central Valley

00:41:23.414 --> 00:41:25.182
regional center and now I've

00:41:25.249 --> 00:41:27.017
seen that transition to an

00:41:27.084 --> 00:41:27.618
health insurance companies and

00:41:27.685 --> 00:41:29.119
now medi cal.

00:41:29.186 --> 00:41:31.055
Sting quite a ride.

00:41:31.121 --> 00:41:33.424
And it since it's services for

00:41:33.490 --> 00:41:35.192
children with a diagnosis of

00:41:35.259 --> 00:41:37.027
autism focus on core behavior

00:41:37.094 --> 00:41:39.029
deficits in accesses parents

00:41:39.096 --> 00:41:41.232
participate in one to one

00:41:41.298 --> 00:41:43.167
intensive services between an

00:41:43.234 --> 00:41:43.634
analyst in a child.

00:41:43.701 --> 00:41:45.402
The assessment and intervention

00:41:45.469 --> 00:41:47.338
plan are proposed to

00:41:47.404 --> 00:41:49.206
specifically address that

00:41:49.273 --> 00:41:51.275
individual child's and deficits

00:41:51.342 --> 00:41:53.077
in accesses.

00:41:53.143 --> 00:41:53.644
It's a huge commitment by

00:41:53.711 --> 00:41:57.248
families we're looking at ten to

00:41:57.314 --> 00:41:57.882
forty hours a week of service

00:41:57.948 --> 00:41:59.283
for a child that might be two

00:41:59.350 --> 00:42:01.118
years to four years of age.

00:42:01.185 --> 00:42:04.955
And however --

00:42:05.022 --> 00:42:06.957
As a conservative taxpayer

00:42:07.024 --> 00:42:09.059
myself and a scientist I've

00:42:09.126 --> 00:42:11.362
always interest in the data --

00:42:11.428 --> 00:42:12.997
So.

00:42:13.063 --> 00:42:15.299
Because of the accountability of

00:42:15.366 --> 00:42:17.101
that we were curious as the

00:42:17.167 --> 00:42:19.003
company to see the fiscal impact

00:42:19.069 --> 00:42:21.071
which I think is important to

00:42:21.138 --> 00:42:21.372
all y'all.

00:42:21.438 --> 00:42:23.340
All y'all's what we say here in

00:42:23.407 --> 00:42:25.175
Central Valley.

00:42:25.242 --> 00:42:27.011
Home we're very curious about

00:42:27.077 --> 00:42:29.013
the fiscal impact and so we did

00:42:29.079 --> 00:42:29.647
some in house research looking

00:42:29.713 --> 00:42:31.181
at children with the diagnosis

00:42:31.248 --> 00:42:33.117
of autism he received early

00:42:33.183 --> 00:42:33.617
intervention services.

00:42:33.684 --> 00:42:35.386
Defined as twenty hours or

00:42:35.452 --> 00:42:37.588
greater beginning before the age

00:42:37.655 --> 00:42:41.458
of 485290% of those children

00:42:41.525 --> 00:42:43.193
landed in general education

00:42:43.260 --> 00:42:45.062
public school.

00:42:45.129 --> 00:42:47.064
With no support.

00:42:47.131 --> 00:42:49.133
You could not identify them from

00:42:49.199 --> 00:42:51.068
other children in a class.

00:42:51.135 --> 00:42:53.103
And now I'd like to say that is

00:42:53.170 --> 00:42:53.704
because we're create company.

00:42:53.771 --> 00:42:55.372
Well it's actually because of

00:42:55.439 --> 00:42:57.441
great team thing to do with just

00:42:57.508 --> 00:42:59.109
as it --

00:42:59.176 --> 00:43:01.378
It's not an accident though it's

00:43:01.445 --> 00:43:03.280
result of good AB services with

00:43:03.347 --> 00:43:05.316
calf careful treatment planning.

00:43:05.382 --> 00:43:07.284
Parents to commit to consistent

00:43:07.351 --> 00:43:09.053
services and sacrifice countless

00:43:09.119 --> 00:43:11.155
hours for children's progress.

00:43:11.221 --> 00:43:11.689
It's result of staff who

00:43:11.755 --> 00:43:13.357
diligently followed through with

00:43:13.424 --> 00:43:15.192
program curriculum teachers who

00:43:15.259 --> 00:43:17.227
collaborated with us it was

00:43:17.294 --> 00:43:17.895
result of whites funding from a

00:43:17.962 --> 00:43:19.396
regional center careful steps to

00:43:19.463 --> 00:43:21.098
achieving accountability for the

00:43:21.165 --> 00:43:23.133
provider and the parent and

00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:25.002
straight up hard work.

00:43:25.069 --> 00:43:27.171
Is result of team work.

00:43:27.237 --> 00:43:29.139
And we to as a company

00:43:29.206 --> 00:43:31.342
experience a lot of the

00:43:31.408 --> 00:43:33.210
challenges that and that the ark

00:43:33.277 --> 00:43:35.245
experience it's very difficult

00:43:35.312 --> 00:43:37.147
for us.

00:43:37.214 --> 00:43:38.983
To an attract and retain

00:43:39.049 --> 00:43:41.051
individuals who are.

00:43:41.118 --> 00:43:43.020
Trained in in behavior analysis

00:43:43.087 --> 00:43:45.122
who might speak Spanish you

00:43:45.189 --> 00:43:45.789
might speak mom who are eager to

00:43:45.856 --> 00:43:49.059
help in a very stressful job.

00:43:49.126 --> 00:43:51.195
We've had rate freezes for very

00:43:51.261 --> 00:43:53.097
long time --

00:43:53.163 --> 00:43:55.132
But I'm hooked so I'm not going

00:43:55.199 --> 00:43:57.334
anywhere because once you seen a

00:43:57.401 --> 00:43:59.436
child and progress and you see a

00:43:59.503 --> 00:44:01.438
family and turn around to be

00:44:01.505 --> 00:44:03.107
able to have dinner together is

00:44:03.173 --> 00:44:05.075
here child say their first words.

00:44:05.142 --> 00:44:09.179
You get hooked so.

00:44:09.246 --> 00:44:13.384
An a couple of then we also work

00:44:13.450 --> 00:44:13.584
with.

00:44:13.650 --> 00:44:15.152
I do want to leave out that we

00:44:15.219 --> 00:44:15.819
also work with teens and adults.

00:44:15.886 --> 00:44:19.323
And as it provider I've seen not

00:44:19.390 --> 00:44:19.923
population of individuals who

00:44:19.990 --> 00:44:21.425
missed out on that early

00:44:21.492 --> 00:44:22.993
intervention.

00:44:23.060 --> 00:44:23.660
Applied behavior analysis still

00:44:23.727 --> 00:44:25.429
works for them it's a different

00:44:25.496 --> 00:44:27.231
set of unique challenges --

00:44:27.297 --> 00:44:31.035
And so we do provide services to

00:44:31.101 --> 00:44:31.435
teens and adults.

00:44:31.502 --> 00:44:35.572
And we help increase behavior

00:44:35.639 --> 00:44:37.207
such as effective communication

00:44:37.274 --> 00:44:39.276
safety awareness self management

00:44:39.343 --> 00:44:41.111
and other socially valued

00:44:41.178 --> 00:44:43.347
behaviors increase independence

00:44:43.414 --> 00:44:43.680
and autonomy.

00:44:43.747 --> 00:44:45.382
Also system reduction with

00:44:45.449 --> 00:44:47.284
behaviors that create barriers

00:44:47.351 --> 00:44:49.186
for them such as aggression or

00:44:49.253 --> 00:44:50.988
self injurious behavior

00:44:51.055 --> 00:44:51.288
[inaudible]

00:44:51.355 --> 00:44:55.025
An here in the valley.

00:44:55.092 --> 00:44:55.526
We do have some unique

00:44:55.592 --> 00:44:57.227
challenges that I see.

00:44:57.294 --> 00:45:01.198
As a provider and families.

00:45:01.265 --> 00:45:03.300
We're in fast geographic areas

00:45:03.367 --> 00:45:05.035
you'll now.

00:45:05.102 --> 00:45:07.237
And since we provide services in

00:45:07.304 --> 00:45:09.106
the homes that means we're

00:45:09.173 --> 00:45:11.041
having staff drive.

00:45:11.108 --> 00:45:13.277
Needs vast geographic areas --

00:45:13.343 --> 00:45:15.345
And since autism and other

00:45:15.412 --> 00:45:17.314
disabilities they're not

00:45:17.381 --> 00:45:19.316
discriminative the impact the

00:45:19.383 --> 00:45:21.051
entire community reaching from

00:45:21.118 --> 00:45:23.053
every socioeconomic class every

00:45:23.120 --> 00:45:23.687
gender every race and ethnicity

00:45:23.754 --> 00:45:27.458
and every corner of our

00:45:27.524 --> 00:45:27.758
community.

00:45:27.825 --> 00:45:29.326
Several unique challenges --

00:45:29.393 --> 00:45:31.161
That come to mind as heather

00:45:31.228 --> 00:45:33.397
mentioned is reaching the many

00:45:33.464 --> 00:45:35.165
variety of cultures and and

00:45:35.232 --> 00:45:37.101
families where.

00:45:37.167 --> 00:45:37.601
Stereotypically Sam are

00:45:37.668 --> 00:45:39.336
skeptical of outsiders coming

00:45:39.403 --> 00:45:41.338
and so providing centers or

00:45:41.405 --> 00:45:41.605
other --

00:45:41.672 --> 00:45:43.340
Means of attaining applied

00:45:43.407 --> 00:45:47.010
behavior analysis would be great.

00:45:47.077 --> 00:45:49.146
But again it takes spending.

00:45:49.213 --> 00:45:52.983
Am keep keeping in retaining and

00:45:53.050 --> 00:45:53.584
monolingual Spanish speaking.

00:45:53.650 --> 00:45:57.020
Employees has been so difficult.

00:45:57.087 --> 00:45:59.022
True story I played a plate I

00:45:59.089 --> 00:45:59.556
played to hold them back

00:45:59.623 --> 00:46:01.258
behavior health when they were

00:46:01.325 --> 00:46:03.060
hiring for a modeling tools are

00:46:03.127 --> 00:46:03.627
bilingual Spanish speaking

00:46:03.694 --> 00:46:05.295
individual I speak no Spanish

00:46:05.362 --> 00:46:07.231
what I thought I could find

00:46:07.297 --> 00:46:09.032
people that speaks.

00:46:09.099 --> 00:46:09.700
You can find people that speak

00:46:09.766 --> 00:46:11.201
other languages but it is a

00:46:11.268 --> 00:46:13.237
unique challenge keeping them

00:46:13.303 --> 00:46:13.637
retaining them.

00:46:13.704 --> 00:46:17.107
On in the in the work force reap

00:46:17.174 --> 00:46:17.708
freezes and difficulties with

00:46:17.774 --> 00:46:19.209
that [inaudible]

00:46:19.276 --> 00:46:25.048
I am.

00:46:25.115 --> 00:46:27.050
Another trend that I've seen.

00:46:27.117 --> 00:46:29.086
As the health insurance and

00:46:29.153 --> 00:46:31.155
Medicare transitioning.

00:46:31.221 --> 00:46:31.755
We are so blessed that front

00:46:31.822 --> 00:46:33.190
Central Valley regional center

00:46:33.257 --> 00:46:35.092
has been incredible with helping

00:46:35.159 --> 00:46:37.227
through those transitions I feel

00:46:37.294 --> 00:46:39.096
like it's a team teamwork thing.

00:46:39.163 --> 00:46:39.696
Every day I work with three

00:46:39.763 --> 00:46:41.431
different regional centers and

00:46:41.498 --> 00:46:43.467
this is a star regional center

00:46:43.534 --> 00:46:45.502
Central Valley regional center

00:46:45.569 --> 00:46:47.137
talk about team work and

00:46:47.204 --> 00:46:47.504
transitioning.

00:46:47.571 --> 00:46:49.106
South are not afraid to hold

00:46:49.173 --> 00:46:51.008
providers accountable.

00:46:51.074 --> 00:46:52.976
In as a provider I'm thankful

00:46:53.043 --> 00:46:55.245
for that because I've seen many

00:46:55.312 --> 00:46:55.546
providers.

00:46:55.612 --> 00:46:57.447
Senate shop here in the valley

00:46:57.514 --> 00:46:59.149
there here today gone tomorrow

00:46:59.216 --> 00:46:59.583
in so I think that

00:46:59.650 --> 00:47:03.120
accountability continued and is

00:47:03.187 --> 00:47:05.022
very important.

00:47:05.088 --> 00:47:07.024
For our consumers.

00:47:07.090 --> 00:47:07.624
And I heard a time I think I'm

00:47:07.691 --> 00:47:09.193
done [inaudible]

00:47:09.259 --> 00:47:11.028
Now.

00:47:11.094 --> 00:47:13.063
I think I'm done.

00:47:13.130 --> 00:47:13.497
Thank you so much.

00:47:13.564 --> 00:47:17.067
Thank you.

00:47:17.134 --> 00:47:19.036
We're gonna move on to Mister

00:47:19.102 --> 00:47:20.938
chairman have just absolutely

00:47:21.004 --> 00:47:22.940
Christmas --

00:47:23.006 --> 00:47:25.108
There's a reoccurring theme and

00:47:25.175 --> 00:47:25.742
I wanted to highlighted because

00:47:25.809 --> 00:47:29.246
it's nice when we hear it to

00:47:29.313 --> 00:47:31.114
make sure that we capture it and

00:47:31.181 --> 00:47:33.050
that was transportation --

00:47:33.116 --> 00:47:35.219
I was recently at monta Vista

00:47:35.285 --> 00:47:37.387
it's a in read Lee and they have

00:47:37.454 --> 00:47:39.489
moderate to severe developmental.

00:47:39.556 --> 00:47:41.391
Disabilities and they were

00:47:41.458 --> 00:47:43.260
discussing similar concerns

00:47:43.327 --> 00:47:45.095
about transportation.

00:47:45.162 --> 00:47:47.231
And so I just wanted to take a

00:47:47.297 --> 00:47:47.831
moment and highlight that if I

00:47:47.898 --> 00:47:48.999
could.

00:47:49.066 --> 00:47:51.335
And also to say the importance

00:47:51.401 --> 00:47:51.868
of early intervention --

00:47:51.935 --> 00:47:53.237
Tomorrow I'm going to a

00:47:53.303 --> 00:47:57.007
conference in.

00:47:57.074 --> 00:47:58.976
Adverse childhood experiences

00:47:59.042 --> 00:48:01.178
which for those of you that have

00:48:01.245 --> 00:48:03.347
not heard me before it's what I

00:48:03.413 --> 00:48:05.315
believe is the single largest

00:48:05.382 --> 00:48:07.084
public health discrepancy that

00:48:07.150 --> 00:48:09.019
we're not talking about enough.

00:48:09.086 --> 00:48:11.321
And so I hope that those of you

00:48:11.388 --> 00:48:12.990
in the room will take this

00:48:13.056 --> 00:48:13.657
opportunity to do some research

00:48:13.724 --> 00:48:15.025
on it.

00:48:15.092 --> 00:48:15.692
There's a wonderful book called

00:48:15.759 --> 00:48:17.394
the deepest well if you have not

00:48:17.461 --> 00:48:19.363
read it it's one of the best

00:48:19.429 --> 00:48:21.031
books I've read in a decade.

00:48:21.098 --> 00:48:23.033
Based off what you are saying I

00:48:23.100 --> 00:48:25.068
think you also see the

00:48:25.135 --> 00:48:25.569
importance of that early

00:48:25.636 --> 00:48:29.006
intervention and that it is wise

00:48:29.072 --> 00:48:31.108
for us to make sure we are.

00:48:31.174 --> 00:48:35.045
Funding it appropriately.

00:48:35.112 --> 00:48:37.347
Our fellow thank you a doctor

00:48:37.414 --> 00:48:39.349
Arambula who as I mentioned he

00:48:39.416 --> 00:48:41.318
has been such a champion in the

00:48:41.385 --> 00:48:45.255
assembly and we talk about so

00:48:45.322 --> 00:48:47.124
many issues that we've --

00:48:47.190 --> 00:48:49.259
Motorcross and then shared the

00:48:49.326 --> 00:48:51.028
committee shared with us and we

00:48:51.094 --> 00:48:52.996
both fought.

00:48:53.063 --> 00:48:55.165
Tirelessly home.

00:48:55.232 --> 00:48:58.969
But to no avail sometimes things

00:48:59.036 --> 00:49:00.971
get up to the administration and

00:49:01.038 --> 00:49:03.073
and they're not supported and so --

00:49:03.140 --> 00:49:05.242
We have a new a new a regime

00:49:05.309 --> 00:49:07.010
coming in.

00:49:07.077 --> 00:49:07.477
And hopefully a new.

00:49:07.544 --> 00:49:09.346
Opportunity cool going forward.

00:49:09.413 --> 00:49:11.315

in California and we have a

00:49:17.321 --> 00:49:19.523
funding bill that sound after

00:49:19.589 --> 00:49:21.191

00:51:59.382 --> 00:52:01.585
relate to our people with down

00:52:01.651 --> 00:52:03.153
syndrome other ID and all say ID

00:52:03.220 --> 00:52:05.155
to keep it quick short.

00:52:05.222 --> 00:52:05.655
I. volunteers a private

00:52:05.722 --> 00:52:07.324
consultant and advocate for

00:52:07.390 --> 00:52:09.359
parents at their child's eyed

00:52:09.426 --> 00:52:11.228
peas for those of autism and

00:52:11.294 --> 00:52:13.296
down syndrome and the Central

00:52:13.363 --> 00:52:13.964
Valley I've also been asked to

00:52:14.030 --> 00:52:15.532
be an expert witness for special

00:52:15.599 --> 00:52:17.501
education attorney here in town.

00:52:17.567 --> 00:52:19.536
And a valley children's hospital

00:52:19.603 --> 00:52:21.071
I work with children.

00:52:21.137 --> 00:52:23.039
With idea who are medically

00:52:23.106 --> 00:52:24.941
fragile and sometimes I work

00:52:25.008 --> 00:52:27.244
with parents who have ID and our

00:52:27.310 --> 00:52:27.844
regional center clients that

00:52:27.911 --> 00:52:29.145
also have children.

00:52:29.212 --> 00:52:35.418
With the ID and her medically

00:52:35.485 --> 00:52:35.685
fragile.

00:52:35.752 --> 00:52:37.621
So my biggest thing is we've

00:52:37.687 --> 00:52:40.957
heard already competitive wage

00:52:41.024 --> 00:52:41.458
wages for caregivers.

00:52:41.525 --> 00:52:43.126
The high turnover rate for

00:52:43.193 --> 00:52:43.727
carriers who leave for higher

00:52:43.793 --> 00:52:44.060
paying jobs.

00:52:44.127 --> 00:52:45.328
With almost any job being a

00:52:45.395 --> 00:52:45.629
higher rate.

00:52:45.695 --> 00:52:49.165
This for my daughter lives in a

00:52:49.232 --> 00:52:51.401
house with her two friends and

00:52:51.468 --> 00:52:53.003
staff of my daughter's home

00:52:53.069 --> 00:52:55.071
results a lack of continuity and

00:52:55.138 --> 00:52:57.274
security fell by the girls in

00:52:57.340 --> 00:52:57.674
their own home.

00:52:57.741 --> 00:52:59.342
Care givers usually work part

00:52:59.409 --> 00:53:01.378
time so that benefits don't have

00:53:01.444 --> 00:53:05.015
to be paid by the employer

00:53:05.081 --> 00:53:07.050
because of their constraints.

00:53:07.117 --> 00:53:07.751
And the move on for higher wages

00:53:07.817 --> 00:53:09.352
health insurance and other

00:53:09.419 --> 00:53:11.388
benefits many work more than one

00:53:11.454 --> 00:53:13.256
job to make ends meet.

00:53:13.323 --> 00:53:15.025
There's a lack of qualified

00:53:15.091 --> 00:53:17.193
workers also because of these

00:53:17.260 --> 00:53:19.129
low wages and they I have that

00:53:19.195 --> 00:53:19.829
and none of them have many have

00:53:19.896 --> 00:53:21.498
come to work in the girls home

00:53:21.565 --> 00:53:23.033
that have had no experience

00:53:23.099 --> 00:53:23.633
working with a person with a

00:53:23.700 --> 00:53:25.201
disability.

00:53:25.268 --> 00:53:27.470
The pay support staff that I've

00:53:27.537 --> 00:53:29.039
worked with my daughter includes

00:53:29.105 --> 00:53:31.041
these agencies respite in home

00:53:31.107 --> 00:53:31.675
supportive services independent

00:53:31.741 --> 00:53:35.178
living services supported living

00:53:35.245 --> 00:53:35.445
services.

00:53:35.512 --> 00:53:37.247
And a day program [inaudible]

00:53:37.314 --> 00:53:38.982
Housing.

00:53:39.049 --> 00:53:41.284
Housing let me give you the

00:53:41.351 --> 00:53:43.053
picture there's a lack of a poor

00:53:43.119 --> 00:53:43.553
formal housing and safe

00:53:43.620 --> 00:53:45.155
neighborhoods.

00:53:45.221 --> 00:53:47.290
Choices are limited my daughter

00:53:47.357 --> 00:53:49.059
in her to remove roommates with

00:53:49.125 --> 00:53:50.961
down syndrome are able to afford

00:53:51.027 --> 00:53:51.394
to rent and this.

00:53:51.461 --> 00:53:53.396
The same neighborhood that I

00:53:53.463 --> 00:53:55.398
live in only due to them sharing

00:53:55.465 --> 00:53:57.467
the reasonable and reduced rate.

00:53:57.534 --> 00:53:59.402
Given by the landlord and having

00:53:59.469 --> 00:54:01.304
three of them live together in

00:54:01.371 --> 00:54:03.506
the same house so they can share

00:54:03.573 --> 00:54:03.807
expensive.

00:54:03.873 --> 00:54:05.642
This would not be feasible ishe

00:54:05.709 --> 00:54:07.310
if my daughter wanted to live by

00:54:07.377 --> 00:54:09.279
herself or with one other person

00:54:09.346 --> 00:54:11.247
or in another city. For contacts

00:54:11.314 --> 00:54:13.383
they pay twelve hundred dollars

00:54:13.450 --> 00:54:15.151
a month and you heard rented a

00:54:15.218 --> 00:54:16.987
small apartment so thousand so

00:54:17.053 --> 00:54:17.621
it is a really rose reasonable

00:54:17.687 --> 00:54:19.055
rate.

00:54:19.122 --> 00:54:21.291
And that she received about.

00:54:21.358 --> 00:54:25.228
A thousand dollars a month for

00:54:25.295 --> 00:54:25.629
social security.

00:54:25.695 --> 00:54:27.397
In my job and help the couple

00:54:27.464 --> 00:54:29.032
from Kern county regional center

00:54:29.099 --> 00:54:29.666
who were the parents were --

00:54:29.733 --> 00:54:31.434
Clients moved to be closer to

00:54:31.501 --> 00:54:33.370
our hospital at valley

00:54:33.436 --> 00:54:33.670
children's.

00:54:33.737 --> 00:54:35.572
Because they had a daughter who

00:54:35.639 --> 00:54:37.340
had ID and developmental

00:54:37.407 --> 00:54:37.941
disabilities and was medically

00:54:38.008 --> 00:54:39.442
fragile we could only find a

00:54:39.509 --> 00:54:41.444
section eight housing apartment

00:54:41.511 --> 00:54:43.079
for them.

00:54:43.146 --> 00:54:43.713
In in that part of town which we

00:54:43.780 --> 00:54:45.148
lay.

00:54:45.215 --> 00:54:49.119
Criminal activity and gangs the

00:54:49.185 --> 00:54:49.552
soon had to leave.

00:54:49.619 --> 00:54:52.989
Transportation another favorite.

00:54:53.056 --> 00:54:53.623
And I'll give you a picture of

00:54:53.690 --> 00:54:55.492
that as they will go through

00:54:55.558 --> 00:54:57.293
this for those with ID the handy

00:54:57.360 --> 00:54:59.362
right system has had ongoing

00:54:59.429 --> 00:55:00.997
problems.

00:55:01.064 --> 00:55:03.199
And with being unreliable and

00:55:03.266 --> 00:55:05.068
untimely also are handy right

00:55:05.135 --> 00:55:07.003
can't cross country county lines.

00:55:07.070 --> 00:55:07.604
So if you want to come from

00:55:07.671 --> 00:55:09.339
Clovis to valley children's

00:55:09.406 --> 00:55:11.341
hospital you cannot take the

00:55:11.408 --> 00:55:11.608
saying --

00:55:11.675 --> 00:55:13.576
Handy right you have to switch

00:55:13.643 --> 00:55:15.011
county county.

00:55:15.078 --> 00:55:17.013
Resources.

00:55:17.080 --> 00:55:17.580
Basically there's no real

00:55:17.647 --> 00:55:19.249
transportation available those

00:55:19.315 --> 00:55:21.384
two with ID that have factors

00:55:21.451 --> 00:55:23.319
that put their safety at risk.

00:55:23.386 --> 00:55:27.057
Regional center under SLS us

00:55:27.123 --> 00:55:29.125
that the girls learn to take the

00:55:29.192 --> 00:55:31.027
city bus which I understand.

00:55:31.094 --> 00:55:33.163
But while I'm sure that they can

00:55:33.229 --> 00:55:35.131
learn to maneuver the bus system

00:55:35.198 --> 00:55:37.033
to a certain extent.

00:55:37.100 --> 00:55:37.634
The fact remains that three

00:55:37.701 --> 00:55:39.169
young ladies who are five feet

00:55:39.235 --> 00:55:39.536
tall and under.

00:55:39.602 --> 00:55:41.504
Who don't look typical are going

00:55:41.571 --> 00:55:45.075
to be targeted by others who are

00:55:45.141 --> 00:55:45.675
waiting to take advantage of

00:55:45.742 --> 00:55:45.875
them?

00:55:45.942 --> 00:55:46.509
Safety is a key issue for all of

00:55:46.576 --> 00:55:49.045
us.

00:55:49.112 --> 00:55:51.181
And on and Salas program to

00:55:51.247 --> 00:55:53.149
fight transportation I would

00:55:53.216 --> 00:55:53.717
like to see an independent

00:55:53.783 --> 00:55:55.251
company established that will

00:55:55.318 --> 00:55:57.087
cry transportation services.

00:55:57.153 --> 00:55:59.389
That's a standalone of like them

00:55:59.456 --> 00:56:01.224
see vendor through the regional

00:56:01.291 --> 00:56:01.458
center.

00:56:01.524 --> 00:56:03.293
Bet that with or without self

00:56:03.359 --> 00:56:05.295
determination that research

00:56:05.361 --> 00:56:07.097
there that resource can be

00:56:07.163 --> 00:56:08.965
accessed through our regional

00:56:09.032 --> 00:56:09.199
center.

00:56:09.265 --> 00:56:10.967
I know of two young men recently

00:56:11.034 --> 00:56:13.303
who took the city bus. One with

00:56:13.369 --> 00:56:15.004
autism and one with a AT.

00:56:15.071 --> 00:56:17.207
Who were bullied another young

00:56:17.273 --> 00:56:19.275
man with autism who was lost on

00:56:19.342 --> 00:56:21.111
the bus system because he didn't

00:56:21.177 --> 00:56:21.611
know where to get off?

00:56:21.678 --> 00:56:25.115
And his phone had died he was

00:56:25.181 --> 00:56:27.183
found hours later.

00:56:27.250 --> 00:56:27.851
I would like to speak a little

00:56:27.917 --> 00:56:29.519
bit about Central Valley

00:56:29.586 --> 00:56:30.987
regional center I have a long

00:56:31.054 --> 00:56:33.156
relationship with them.

00:56:33.223 --> 00:56:35.024
And a very good when.

00:56:35.091 --> 00:56:35.692
I think that the regional center

00:56:35.759 --> 00:56:37.427
budget not billing fully

00:56:37.494 --> 00:56:39.195
refunded has resulted in changes

00:56:39.262 --> 00:56:41.431
in processes and policies that

00:56:41.498 --> 00:56:42.999
have medical negatively affect

00:56:43.066 --> 00:56:45.034
our community which you've heard.

00:56:45.101 --> 00:56:45.702
The first of the loss of social

00:56:45.769 --> 00:56:47.370
recreation cam funding which is

00:56:47.437 --> 00:56:49.372
made a huge impact on my

00:56:49.439 --> 00:56:51.274
daughter's life and her peers.

00:56:51.341 --> 00:56:55.044
Again let me put a face on this.

00:56:55.111 --> 00:56:57.147
My daughter has to dance classes

00:56:57.213 --> 00:56:59.349
in dances for two and a half

00:56:59.415 --> 00:57:01.084
hours a week well you might say

00:57:01.151 --> 00:57:01.618
well that's an extra not

00:57:01.684 --> 00:57:03.219
everybody can do that.

00:57:03.286 --> 00:57:05.188
Let me explain the benefits of

00:57:05.255 --> 00:57:07.257
dance with this extra curricular

00:57:07.323 --> 00:57:09.325
activity and house of impacted

00:57:09.392 --> 00:57:11.094
her life.

00:57:11.161 --> 00:57:11.694
Dance is provided building

00:57:11.761 --> 00:57:13.263
friendships and socialization

00:57:13.329 --> 00:57:15.498
with her typical peers and non

00:57:15.565 --> 00:57:17.200
typical peers.

00:57:17.267 --> 00:57:19.369
Movement exercise building tone

00:57:19.435 --> 00:57:23.006
in maintenance.

00:57:23.072 --> 00:57:24.974
Promoting her physical and

00:57:25.041 --> 00:57:25.608
mental strength and this is an

00:57:25.675 --> 00:57:27.477
actively seeking help for the

00:57:27.544 --> 00:57:29.145
rest of her life this is

00:57:29.212 --> 00:57:31.147
something we all want to have.

00:57:31.214 --> 00:57:33.316
Another is a change in the

00:57:33.383 --> 00:57:35.318
behavioral services is being

00:57:35.385 --> 00:57:35.652
offered by.

00:57:35.718 --> 00:57:37.120
By -- To

00:57:37.187 --> 00:57:39.022
bother to Perrance.

00:57:39.088 --> 00:57:41.124
Well my child was in grade

00:57:41.191 --> 00:57:42.992
school age I was able to call

00:57:43.059 --> 00:57:43.593
regional center get behaviors

00:57:43.660 --> 00:57:45.461
within a couple weeks to come to

00:57:45.528 --> 00:57:49.165
my house. To help with.

00:57:49.232 --> 00:57:51.267
The beef behavior this is before

00:57:51.334 --> 00:57:53.169
the cats.

00:57:53.236 --> 00:57:53.736
This is no longer helping

00:57:53.803 --> 00:57:54.404
parents are now required to take

00:57:54.470 --> 00:57:55.471
it behavior modification class

00:57:55.538 --> 00:57:57.273
parenting class the feedback I

00:57:57.340 --> 00:57:59.008
have received that the parents

00:57:59.075 --> 00:58:01.010
are first really hesitant to go

00:58:01.077 --> 00:58:01.611
been find it very valuable.

00:58:01.678 --> 00:58:03.446
However when there's a behavior

00:58:03.513 --> 00:58:05.181
that's disrupting the whole

00:58:05.248 --> 00:58:07.050
house.

00:58:07.116 --> 00:58:07.684
The whole home family home in

00:58:07.750 --> 00:58:09.385
these to be a quicker way to get

00:58:09.452 --> 00:58:11.154
a behaviorist of this at the

00:58:11.221 --> 00:58:12.956
family before stresses hiring.

00:58:13.022 --> 00:58:14.924
And the family unit is there and

00:58:14.991 --> 00:58:17.327
I see this as a social worker

00:58:17.393 --> 00:58:17.727
and as a parent.

00:58:17.794 --> 00:58:19.395
About twenty years ago the

00:58:19.462 --> 00:58:21.130
regional center implemented a

00:58:21.197 --> 00:58:21.664
great plan to get a dozen

00:58:21.731 --> 00:58:25.101
parents. To be trained.

00:58:25.168 --> 00:58:25.768
By a behavior management agency

00:58:25.835 --> 00:58:27.337
that was from Sacramento

00:58:27.403 --> 00:58:29.339
instructor taught about six of

00:58:29.405 --> 00:58:31.140
those couples over an eight to

00:58:31.207 --> 00:58:31.774
ten week period of time I can't

00:58:31.841 --> 00:58:33.309
remember exactly.

00:58:33.376 --> 00:58:33.877
And we were given the tools

00:58:33.943 --> 00:58:37.013
together in.

00:58:37.080 --> 00:58:39.249
Tools -- To

00:58:39.315 --> 00:58:41.184
test and implement a behavior

00:58:41.251 --> 00:58:43.286
plan for a child this was done

00:58:43.353 --> 00:58:45.421
with videos group work in

00:58:45.488 --> 00:58:47.190
instruction Burke but an essence

00:58:47.257 --> 00:58:49.359
we became behavior modification

00:58:49.425 --> 00:58:49.592
Saudi.

00:58:49.659 --> 00:58:51.527
And I won't no longer called the

00:58:51.594 --> 00:58:55.164
reason center for behaviors help.

00:58:55.231 --> 00:58:57.033
I could do that on my own.

00:58:57.100 --> 00:58:59.035
Education which is my last area.

00:58:59.102 --> 00:58:59.702
Here a few of the most pressing

00:58:59.769 --> 00:59:01.404
issues with comment threads a

00:59:01.471 --> 00:59:03.339
see happening across the state I

00:59:03.406 --> 00:59:05.475
have my own experiences with bad.

00:59:05.541 --> 00:59:07.577
And her from other families in

00:59:07.644 --> 00:59:09.345
person and through other state

00:59:09.412 --> 00:59:11.214
advocacy groups that I belong.

00:59:11.281 --> 00:59:13.116
To the individuals with

00:59:13.182 --> 00:59:15.051
disabilities act IDA.

00:59:15.118 --> 00:59:17.186
That was an act in nineteen

00:59:17.253 --> 00:59:19.155
ninety is being ignored.

00:59:19.222 --> 00:59:19.789
Parents are still fighting for

00:59:19.856 --> 00:59:21.324
full inclusion I've fought for

00:59:21.391 --> 00:59:23.526
this twenty five years ago and

00:59:23.593 --> 00:59:25.194
they're still having.

00:59:25.261 --> 00:59:27.063
The same ridiculous fight.

00:59:27.130 --> 00:59:29.432
District state and there's

00:59:29.499 --> 00:59:31.267
several districts I have worked

00:59:31.334 --> 00:59:31.467
with.

00:59:31.534 --> 00:59:33.303
That they don't do full

00:59:33.369 --> 00:59:35.271
inclusion they don't give one on

00:59:35.338 --> 00:59:37.073
one support.

00:59:37.140 --> 00:59:39.375
Maybe give you a few hours are

00:59:39.442 --> 00:59:41.277
part of the day the status are

00:59:41.344 --> 00:59:43.346
policy and the policy differs

00:59:43.413 --> 00:59:45.081
from federal.

00:59:45.148 --> 00:59:47.350
Laws there's the that support

00:59:47.417 --> 00:59:49.385
the request for an inclusive

00:59:49.452 --> 00:59:51.087
setting and ideas least

00:59:51.154 --> 00:59:55.024
restrictive environment.

00:59:55.091 --> 00:59:55.658
We don't have the resources is

00:59:55.725 --> 00:59:57.393
not in the best interests of

00:59:57.460 --> 00:59:59.329
your child these are things I

00:59:59.395 --> 01:00:01.097
have heard why do you keep doing

01:00:01.164 --> 01:00:01.631
this to your child she was

01:00:01.698 --> 01:00:05.168
starting first grade.

01:00:05.234 --> 01:00:05.368
Arm.

01:00:05.435 --> 01:00:07.603
So what that's not what the

01:00:07.670 --> 01:00:09.238
parents are asking.

01:00:09.305 --> 01:00:11.207
For what they wanted their child

01:00:11.274 --> 01:00:13.209
to learn alongside their their

01:00:13.276 --> 01:00:15.211
age appropriate peers it's about

01:00:15.278 --> 01:00:19.048
learning the same material.

01:00:19.115 --> 01:00:19.716
Adapted to their needs and with

01:00:19.782 --> 01:00:21.517
necessary accommodations as

01:00:21.584 --> 01:00:23.252
required by law however even

01:00:23.319 --> 01:00:27.023
with going to fair hearing many

01:00:27.090 --> 01:00:29.058
parents lose the battle.

01:00:29.125 --> 01:00:29.659
Another problem is that most

01:00:29.726 --> 01:00:31.427
schools and teachers don't

01:00:31.494 --> 01:00:33.229
ascribe to follow us of the of

01:00:33.296 --> 01:00:33.663
assume competence.

01:00:33.730 --> 01:00:37.066
As soon confidence in our kids.

01:00:37.133 --> 01:00:39.035
They don't challenge arches his

01:00:39.102 --> 01:00:41.137
with age appropriate educational

01:00:41.204 --> 01:00:43.039
opportunities instead of her

01:00:43.106 --> 01:00:45.174
juvenile activities.

01:00:45.241 --> 01:00:45.808
I can tell you act ideas about

01:00:45.875 --> 01:00:47.176
that later.

01:00:47.243 --> 01:00:49.112
I met teachers who have taught

01:00:49.178 --> 01:00:51.014
for twenty years or more and

01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:51.647
have no training and I'm almost

01:00:51.714 --> 01:00:52.982
done.

01:00:53.049 --> 01:00:55.585
In teaching children with ID

01:00:55.651 --> 01:00:57.253
they're never taught even one

01:00:57.320 --> 01:00:59.155
child with the ID and a local

01:00:59.222 --> 01:01:01.057
school that didn't have one

01:01:01.124 --> 01:01:01.657
child with ID in their whole

01:01:01.724 --> 01:01:03.159
school.

01:01:03.226 --> 01:01:05.061
Or district they have only had

01:01:05.128 --> 01:01:06.996
kids with physical disabilities

01:01:07.063 --> 01:01:09.032
the teacher told once told me.

01:01:09.098 --> 01:01:11.000
Who's going to teach that child

01:01:11.067 --> 01:01:11.634
when she found out a child with

01:01:11.701 --> 01:01:13.169
down syndrome is coming into her

01:01:13.236 --> 01:01:15.171
kindergarten class.

01:01:15.238 --> 01:01:15.738
This just happened a couple

01:01:15.805 --> 01:01:17.206
years ago.

01:01:17.273 --> 01:01:19.108
It's important to note that

01:01:19.175 --> 01:01:19.742
students with ID are graduating

01:01:19.809 --> 01:01:21.244
with high school diplomas and

01:01:21.310 --> 01:01:23.212
taking college courses and

01:01:23.279 --> 01:01:25.048
getting real jobs.

01:01:25.114 --> 01:01:25.648
The good things we have in

01:01:25.715 --> 01:01:27.216
Fresno here's my ending.

01:01:27.283 --> 01:01:29.318
We do have I feel one of the

01:01:29.385 --> 01:01:31.020
best regional centers and I see

01:01:31.087 --> 01:01:33.022
that from all the communications

01:01:33.089 --> 01:01:33.623
I have throughout the state.

01:01:33.689 --> 01:01:35.258
They have worked well with me I

01:01:35.324 --> 01:01:35.925
feel I've been reasonable with

01:01:35.992 --> 01:01:37.360
them and they have been

01:01:37.427 --> 01:01:39.062
reasonable with me.

01:01:39.128 --> 01:01:39.595
We have the down Sonora

01:01:39.662 --> 01:01:41.230
socialization of central

01:01:41.297 --> 01:01:43.099
California break the barriers

01:01:43.166 --> 01:01:45.034
exceptional Perrance unlimited

01:01:45.101 --> 01:01:47.070
post secondary education program.

01:01:47.136 --> 01:01:49.038
Projects search brought by my

01:01:49.105 --> 01:01:49.639
good friend Michelle Smith.

01:01:49.705 --> 01:01:55.078
Part of the horse the ark Fresno.

01:01:55.144 --> 01:01:56.946
Participate our kids participate

01:01:57.013 --> 01:01:58.948
in and a day program that even

01:01:59.015 --> 01:02:01.084
focuses just on art.

01:02:01.150 --> 01:02:01.651
Something my daughter also

01:02:01.717 --> 01:02:03.519
laughs. One thing I would like

01:02:03.586 --> 01:02:05.021
to see come --

01:02:05.088 --> 01:02:06.956
To Fresno is the Joey Travolta

film camp in workshops come to

01:02:09.358 --> 01:02:11.127

01:02:11.194 --> 01:02:11.727
and they just started one in

01:02:11.794 --> 01:02:13.162
Stockton.

Undertaking names right now and

01:02:15.131 --> 01:02:16.999

01:02:17.667 --> 01:02:19.502
paid by them and she has on the

01:02:19.569 --> 01:02:21.370

I thank you for your time

01:02:23.439 --> 01:02:25.208

01:02:25.274 --> 01:02:27.043
Thank you.

Thank you for that so we'll move

01:02:29.345 --> 01:02:31.347
on to work our next battle she

01:02:31.414 --> 01:02:39.055
won a cruise.

01:02:39.122 --> 01:02:39.655
Thank you for being here this

01:02:39.722 --> 01:02:55.071
evening.

01:02:55.138 --> 01:02:59.075
Thank you for allowing us to

01:02:59.142 --> 01:03:01.077
come here and talk about what's

01:03:01.144 --> 01:03:03.112
going on the Central Valley I'm

01:03:03.179 --> 01:03:03.746
along the crew some with the

01:03:03.813 --> 01:03:05.348
state council on developmental

01:03:05.414 --> 01:03:07.150
disabilities.

01:03:07.216 --> 01:03:07.650
This acquire region --

01:03:07.717 --> 01:03:09.519
We cover seven counties.

01:03:09.585 --> 01:03:15.024
From Mariposa all the way down --

01:03:15.091 --> 01:03:17.160
To current.

01:03:17.226 --> 01:03:19.095
So a little bit about me I

01:03:19.162 --> 01:03:20.997
actually came.

01:03:21.063 --> 01:03:23.332
To the Central Valley about

01:03:23.399 --> 01:03:25.168
three years ago.

01:03:25.234 --> 01:03:27.203
Have been working for the State

01:03:27.270 --> 01:03:29.005
Council.

01:03:29.071 --> 01:03:29.405
For a long time.

01:03:29.472 --> 01:03:31.574
But I was actually working for

01:03:31.641 --> 01:03:33.309
the state council in Orange

01:03:33.376 --> 01:03:33.543
County.

01:03:33.609 --> 01:03:35.244
So I've seen.

01:03:35.311 --> 01:03:37.280
The difference between what

01:03:37.346 --> 01:03:39.048
happens in Orange County and

01:03:39.115 --> 01:03:39.615
what happens in the Central

01:03:39.682 --> 01:03:39.849
Valley.

01:03:39.916 --> 01:03:41.551
And I'm gonna I'm gonna agree

01:03:41.617 --> 01:03:44.987
with you as far as working with

01:03:45.054 --> 01:03:45.454
the regional center.

01:03:45.521 --> 01:03:46.022
I've seen different regional

01:03:46.088 --> 01:03:50.993
centers county have several --

01:03:51.060 --> 01:03:53.095
Orange County has one and it's

01:03:53.162 --> 01:03:55.264
not always as easy as it has

01:03:55.331 --> 01:03:57.266
been here so I do want to

01:03:57.333 --> 01:03:59.101
commend the regional center and

01:03:59.168 --> 01:03:59.702
I do also want to commend.

01:03:59.769 --> 01:04:03.072
All the agencies that have.

01:04:03.139 --> 01:04:05.408
Allowed me to to work with them

01:04:05.474 --> 01:04:07.143
because it has been.

01:04:07.210 --> 01:04:09.078
A very.

01:04:09.145 --> 01:04:11.447
Different experience working in

01:04:11.514 --> 01:04:13.249
the Central Valley arm the one

01:04:13.316 --> 01:04:15.184
thing I do want.

01:04:15.251 --> 01:04:17.186
To point out is the

01:04:17.253 --> 01:04:17.820
transportation I know we keep

01:04:17.887 --> 01:04:19.322
talking about transportation.

01:04:19.388 --> 01:04:23.159
But coming from.

01:04:23.226 --> 01:04:26.963
Los Angeles the Long Beach area

01:04:27.029 --> 01:04:29.332
I'd it never dawned on me how.

01:04:29.398 --> 01:04:33.202
Big the area who is here how

01:04:33.269 --> 01:04:33.769
long it would take me to get

01:04:33.836 --> 01:04:35.171
from.

01:04:35.238 --> 01:04:39.275
Fresno to Mendota didn't realize

01:04:39.342 --> 01:04:41.110
that there wasn't more than.

01:04:41.177 --> 01:04:43.279
Two lanes basically getting

01:04:43.346 --> 01:04:45.014
there so.

01:04:45.081 --> 01:04:47.116
If I struggle with my car trying

01:04:47.183 --> 01:04:49.085
to get to certain places I can

01:04:49.151 --> 01:04:51.053
only imagine what it's like to

01:04:51.120 --> 01:04:51.520
have to rely on public

01:04:51.587 --> 01:04:55.024
transportation.

01:04:55.091 --> 01:04:57.059
So a little bit about what we do

01:04:57.126 --> 01:04:59.128
our objectives is a State

01:04:59.195 --> 01:05:01.430
Council as we are we have.

01:05:01.497 --> 01:05:05.534
Twelve regional offices and

01:05:05.601 --> 01:05:07.436
again mind the Senate bill Dolly.

01:05:07.503 --> 01:05:11.574
On this the county was is pushed

01:05:11.641 --> 01:05:13.075
the temporal lobe as it

01:05:13.142 --> 01:05:17.079
independence day eight C. we are

01:05:17.146 --> 01:05:19.048
leading please what does little.

01:05:19.115 --> 01:05:21.117
To our we have the LCD is made

01:05:21.183 --> 01:05:23.552
up of thirty one people

01:05:23.619 --> 01:05:24.120
appointed by the governor.

01:05:24.186 --> 01:05:25.621
And what we do so we support

01:05:25.688 --> 01:05:27.723
systems advocacy I'll talk a

01:05:27.790 --> 01:05:29.525
little bit at what looks.

01:05:29.592 --> 01:05:31.527
We do a lot training.

01:05:31.594 --> 01:05:33.829
In the past used to be an H. B.

01:05:33.896 --> 01:05:37.099
that lottery and David Blatt see

01:05:37.166 --> 01:05:41.137
me in would go on to keep peace

01:05:41.203 --> 01:05:47.109
we would talk to we went. To for

01:05:47.176 --> 01:05:49.111
adults who needed transition

01:05:49.178 --> 01:05:49.378
program.

01:05:49.445 --> 01:05:51.280
Are we change to the way we do

01:05:51.347 --> 01:05:53.349
things and there's been some you

01:05:53.416 --> 01:05:55.017
know there's really some.

01:05:55.084 --> 01:05:57.253
The downside about changing that

01:05:57.320 --> 01:05:57.887
is that we don't really get to

01:05:57.953 --> 01:05:59.488
inner act with families as much

01:05:59.555 --> 01:06:01.023
as we used.

01:06:01.090 --> 01:06:03.359
To but we do get to fit get to

01:06:03.426 --> 01:06:05.361
find out what the what systems

01:06:05.428 --> 01:06:07.063
are working and what systems are

01:06:07.129 --> 01:06:09.031
having on issues.

01:06:09.098 --> 01:06:11.233
So we do look at innovative ways

01:06:11.300 --> 01:06:13.135
to to help --

01:06:13.202 --> 01:06:15.471
Other agencies to try to come up

01:06:15.538 --> 01:06:17.039
with solutions.

01:06:17.106 --> 01:06:19.241
We offer resources and we have a

01:06:19.308 --> 01:06:21.243
wonderful state plan that we are

01:06:21.310 --> 01:06:23.412
look at to figure out what we

01:06:23.479 --> 01:06:25.081
need to do --

01:06:25.147 --> 01:06:29.018
As a whole in the state or in my

01:06:29.085 --> 01:06:29.552
little area of the Central

01:06:29.618 --> 01:06:31.220
Valley [inaudible]

01:06:31.287 --> 01:06:33.389
He so again we provide a lot of

01:06:33.456 --> 01:06:35.458
training I do believe that

01:06:35.524 --> 01:06:37.593
educating our community.

01:06:37.660 --> 01:06:39.695
Is the way we are going to be

01:06:39.762 --> 01:06:41.897
able to get understand what's

01:06:41.964 --> 01:06:45.434
this is our avail.

01:06:45.501 --> 01:06:49.305
It's not John.

01:06:49.372 --> 01:06:51.574
Admit you know the point is if

01:06:51.640 --> 01:06:53.409
you know what's this is our

01:06:53.476 --> 01:06:55.344
global not into what to ask.

01:06:55.411 --> 01:06:59.081
For some time.

01:06:59.148 --> 01:07:01.183
It can be the difference.

01:07:01.250 --> 01:07:01.851
Are yours X. sometimes families

01:07:01.917 --> 01:07:03.319
don't know how to describe

01:07:03.386 --> 01:07:03.953
what's going on which makes it

01:07:04.019 --> 01:07:05.254
difficult for agencies to figure

01:07:05.321 --> 01:07:08.991
out what type of services --

01:07:09.058 --> 01:07:11.060
That family might need --

01:07:11.127 --> 01:07:13.028
Let's see.

01:07:13.095 --> 01:07:13.596
We do that again we do the

01:07:13.662 --> 01:07:15.197
systemic advocacy I'll talk a

01:07:15.264 --> 01:07:15.698
little bit about that.

01:07:15.765 --> 01:07:17.433
We work with the different

01:07:17.500 --> 01:07:19.168
communities different providers

01:07:19.235 --> 01:07:21.203
here that I've worked with --

01:07:21.270 --> 01:07:23.339
And we had our this we do have

01:07:23.406 --> 01:07:23.939
the cell to self determine the

01:07:24.006 --> 01:07:25.408
state wide self determination

01:07:25.474 --> 01:07:29.044
advisory committee.

01:07:29.111 --> 01:07:29.645
So some of the gold all the

01:07:29.712 --> 01:07:33.649
goals that we address our self

01:07:33.716 --> 01:07:33.916
advocacy.

01:07:33.983 --> 01:07:35.718
We address formal and more

01:07:35.785 --> 01:07:39.488
community supports that things

01:07:39.555 --> 01:07:41.590
like home port of service.

01:07:41.657 --> 01:07:43.426
It's one agent that we have

01:07:43.492 --> 01:07:47.596
really talked about but in.

01:07:47.663 --> 01:07:51.567
That required.

01:07:51.634 --> 01:07:52.101
Twenty four seven odd type

01:07:52.168 --> 01:07:53.536
support.

01:07:53.602 --> 01:07:57.006
I'll see a new house is huge we

01:07:57.072 --> 01:07:57.373
know the house.

01:07:57.440 --> 01:07:59.475
Issue all California we know

01:07:59.542 --> 01:08:01.110
that certain areas you just

01:08:01.177 --> 01:08:03.112
can't afford to live in --

01:08:03.179 --> 01:08:05.114
We do have that same issue here

01:08:05.181 --> 01:08:07.450
I think here. One of the biggest

01:08:07.516 --> 01:08:09.418
challenges is getting and with

01:08:09.485 --> 01:08:11.187
those developers letting them

01:08:11.253 --> 01:08:13.255
know that our population also

01:08:13.322 --> 01:08:15.324
needs housing that they need to

01:08:15.391 --> 01:08:18.961
set aside units that could house

01:08:19.028 --> 01:08:20.996
our population.

01:08:21.063 --> 01:08:23.165
Early intervention education

01:08:23.232 --> 01:08:25.167
transition and post secondary

01:08:25.234 --> 01:08:27.002
education you brought up

01:08:27.069 --> 01:08:29.138
education and I'm gonna talk a

01:08:29.205 --> 01:08:29.538
little bit about.

01:08:29.605 --> 01:08:31.373
What that is like one of the

01:08:31.440 --> 01:08:33.142
biggest issues here several

01:08:33.209 --> 01:08:35.144
school districts just?

01:08:35.211 --> 01:08:37.446
Do not believe in inclusion and

01:08:37.513 --> 01:08:39.415
inclusion you know we talk about

01:08:39.482 --> 01:08:41.450
being an inclusive society but

01:08:41.517 --> 01:08:43.586
if we can't even get a school

01:08:43.652 --> 01:08:45.287
district to agreed. To place in

01:08:45.354 --> 01:08:47.289
a child in an inclusive

01:08:47.356 --> 01:08:49.258
environment being in a regular

01:08:49.325 --> 01:08:51.060
class with.

01:08:51.126 --> 01:08:53.362
With other other children not

01:08:53.429 --> 01:08:55.097
just being in a special day

01:08:55.164 --> 01:08:57.466
class as an option you know that.

01:08:57.533 --> 01:08:59.502
That really kind of conflicts

01:08:59.568 --> 01:09:03.172
our whole inclusive environment --

01:09:03.239 --> 01:09:03.539
A philosophy.

01:09:03.606 --> 01:09:07.143
And we do do we do a lot with

01:09:07.209 --> 01:09:09.078
health and safety.

01:09:09.144 --> 01:09:11.480
See we also ward community

01:09:11.547 --> 01:09:13.315
grants so.

01:09:13.382 --> 01:09:15.684
Just so you all know keep an eye

01:09:15.751 --> 01:09:17.887
on it I keep an eye out for our

01:09:17.953 --> 01:09:19.088
community ground.

01:09:19.154 --> 01:09:19.321
Level.

01:09:19.388 --> 01:09:23.325
On our part of the year sets and

01:09:23.392 --> 01:09:27.096
disability rights.

01:09:27.162 --> 01:09:29.431
Our other one are funny voices

01:09:29.498 --> 01:09:31.934
minutes Xin for could community

01:09:32.001 --> 01:09:33.569
living.

01:09:33.636 --> 01:09:35.604
So what I'm doing --

01:09:35.671 --> 01:09:37.640
I think one of the big things

01:09:37.706 --> 01:09:39.642
that the special that is doing

01:09:39.708 --> 01:09:41.577
right is all into other.

01:09:41.644 --> 01:09:43.579
We are all.

01:09:43.646 --> 01:09:47.550
In the nation do you think Bob

01:09:47.616 --> 01:09:47.850
[inaudible]

01:09:47.917 --> 01:09:49.552
Can someone.

01:09:49.618 --> 01:09:51.820
We talk about it and it is what

01:09:51.887 --> 01:09:53.789
happens most of the time.

01:09:53.856 --> 01:09:55.424
Will get call.

01:09:55.491 --> 01:09:57.626
We'll get several calls about

01:09:57.693 --> 01:09:59.061
the image.

01:09:59.128 --> 01:10:03.032
After file because looking at

01:10:03.098 --> 01:10:03.499
houses stem vacancy.

01:10:03.566 --> 01:10:07.303
We look at it we we were is that

01:10:07.369 --> 01:10:07.870
there is a trend and at that

01:10:07.937 --> 01:10:09.071
point we might.

01:10:09.138 --> 01:10:11.273
You know talk to a director of

01:10:11.340 --> 01:10:11.941
an agency let them know this is

01:10:12.007 --> 01:10:12.575
what's going on how can we help

01:10:12.641 --> 01:10:13.075
you so that.

01:10:13.142 --> 01:10:15.177
We don't continue having to hear

01:10:15.244 --> 01:10:17.279
about these gonna these issues

01:10:17.346 --> 01:10:19.248
that are going on so I think

01:10:19.315 --> 01:10:21.383
that the Central Valley has that.

01:10:21.450 --> 01:10:23.352
We have that going for us were

01:10:23.419 --> 01:10:25.087
able to communicate were able to

01:10:25.154 --> 01:10:27.022
use each other --

01:10:27.089 --> 01:10:29.158
I know one of the things that I

01:10:29.224 --> 01:10:29.625
want to talk about his

01:10:29.692 --> 01:10:31.160
disparities solutions like. For

01:10:31.226 --> 01:10:33.228
example room heather talked

01:10:33.295 --> 01:10:35.397
about her Brough her promoted a

01:10:35.464 --> 01:10:35.664
project.

01:10:35.731 --> 01:10:37.232
That's a big deal.

01:10:37.299 --> 01:10:41.103
In.

01:10:41.170 --> 01:10:41.770
And I'll tell you what you think

01:10:41.837 --> 01:10:42.304
it's going to be effective

01:10:42.371 --> 01:10:43.472
because they were kind enough to

01:10:43.539 --> 01:10:45.174
have me come in.

01:10:45.240 --> 01:10:47.376
And train their promote thought

01:10:47.443 --> 01:10:51.013
us on generic resources.

01:10:51.080 --> 01:10:52.982
You know generic resources is a

01:10:53.048 --> 01:10:55.184
it's an important part of

01:10:55.250 --> 01:10:55.684
services to people with

01:10:55.751 --> 01:10:57.252
developmental disabilities.

01:10:57.319 --> 01:10:59.121
It's not just.

01:10:59.188 --> 01:11:01.090
Bad -- That

01:11:01.156 --> 01:11:03.259
they're receiving services from

01:11:03.325 --> 01:11:05.127
Central Valley regional center

01:11:05.194 --> 01:11:07.029
or from the school district.

01:11:07.096 --> 01:11:08.998
The generic resources our HSS

01:11:09.064 --> 01:11:11.033
art SSI.

01:11:11.100 --> 01:11:13.035
Are -- Medi

01:11:13.102 --> 01:11:15.037
cal all those other services

01:11:15.104 --> 01:11:17.272
that that a person might require

01:11:17.339 --> 01:11:19.541
in order to be able to live in

01:11:19.608 --> 01:11:21.076
an inclusive environment.

01:11:21.143 --> 01:11:23.078
Inclusive society.

01:11:23.145 --> 01:11:25.381
Are let's see the sequoia office

01:11:25.447 --> 01:11:27.082

01:11:27.149 --> 01:11:31.086
Provided IEP trading's not only.

To to the Central Valley

01:11:31.687 --> 01:11:33.155
regional center staff.

01:11:33.222 --> 01:11:35.090
There are service coordinators.

01:11:35.157 --> 01:11:37.059
So that they can go out and help

01:11:37.126 --> 01:11:41.163
advocate for their clients.

01:11:41.230 --> 01:11:41.797
Let's see we've also provided

01:11:41.864 --> 01:11:43.298
trainees for Madera county

01:11:43.365 --> 01:11:45.367
mental health their therapists

01:11:45.434 --> 01:11:47.336
because they've stay actually

01:11:47.403 --> 01:11:49.138
identified a trend.

01:11:49.204 --> 01:11:51.573
With one of the dais with one of

01:11:51.640 --> 01:11:54.977

The child SS so there's trends

01:11:59.515 --> 01:12:03.018

01:12:03.085 --> 01:12:05.254
And and we're helping with

01:12:05.320 --> 01:12:07.289

01:21:27.849 --> 01:21:29.384
how hard it was for people to

01:21:29.451 --> 01:21:31.019

01:22:07.722 --> 01:22:09.457

01:22:25.140 --> 01:22:27.075

01:22:55.270 --> 01:22:55.637

01:25:59.420 --> 01:26:01.189
To speak about some of the

01:26:01.256 --> 01:26:03.057
issues that we commonly see

01:26:03.124 --> 01:26:05.226
coming into our office and and I

01:26:05.293 --> 01:26:07.095

01:26:07.161 --> 01:26:09.030
Do fair with anything that has

01:26:09.097 --> 01:26:09.497
been said here today

01:26:09.564 --> 01:26:11.366
transportation it's one of the

01:26:11.432 --> 01:26:11.666
big ones.

01:26:11.733 --> 01:26:14.969
Are we also get issues related

01:26:15.036 --> 01:26:17.005
to regional center eligibility.

01:26:17.071 --> 01:26:23.111

regional centered.

01:26:37.725 --> 01:26:39.460
I and I think this is more

01:26:39.527 --> 01:26:41.429
specific to monolingual Spanish

01:26:41.496 --> 01:26:43.064

Are in another issue that we are

01:26:45.433 --> 01:26:47.035

and I have to say that our

01:26:55.176 --> 01:26:55.743

01:26:55.810 --> 01:26:57.211
and they have put a lot of

01:26:57.278 --> 01:26:58.947
efforts into --

01:26:59.013 --> 01:27:01.049
The development of new community

01:27:01.115 --> 01:27:03.217

01:27:03.284 --> 01:27:07.055
are coming out of there --

01:27:07.121 --> 01:27:11.225
I did the disease and we just

01:27:11.292 --> 01:27:13.595
hope that that momentum would

01:27:13.661 --> 01:27:17.065
continue and we would --

01:27:17.131 --> 01:27:17.599

01:28:15.590 --> 01:28:15.790

I know that --

01:28:17.291 --> 01:28:17.825

01:28:19.560 --> 01:28:20.995

homeless at this point in time

01:28:30.371 --> 01:28:32.974

01:28:33.041 --> 01:28:33.608

01:28:35.643 --> 01:28:37.111

01:28:59.367 --> 01:29:01.302
centers as a a pretty good

01:29:01.369 --> 01:29:03.037
turnover of employees.

01:29:03.104 --> 01:29:05.139
And what is your training into a

01:29:05.206 --> 01:29:05.707
full to make sure that the

01:29:05.773 --> 01:29:07.308
people are up to current

01:29:07.375 --> 01:29:09.077
standards --

01:29:09.143 --> 01:29:13.014
In our doing appropriate of

01:29:13.081 --> 01:29:15.049
service to the consumer.

01:29:15.116 --> 01:29:17.351
With regard to training for our

01:29:17.418 --> 01:29:19.087
staff -- So

01:29:19.153 --> 01:29:19.687
when you begin at the central

01:29:19.754 --> 01:29:21.222
regional center you have a two

01:29:21.289 --> 01:29:23.124
week minimum --

01:29:23.191 --> 01:29:23.725
Period where we do orientation

01:29:23.791 --> 01:29:27.228
and before we set you free we

01:29:27.295 --> 01:29:28.996
also set you up with a mentor.

01:29:29.063 --> 01:29:29.630
Of mentors someone who's worked

01:29:29.697 --> 01:29:31.432
in the field for quite a long

01:29:31.499 --> 01:29:33.334
time and supports you in the

01:29:33.401 --> 01:29:35.303
field along with your on going

01:29:35.369 --> 01:29:35.903
team there's ongoing training

01:29:35.970 --> 01:29:37.305
through the orientation period

01:29:37.371 --> 01:29:39.273
for several weeks where they

01:29:39.340 --> 01:29:41.008
come back.

01:29:41.075 --> 01:29:43.211
For but you really can't do

01:29:43.277 --> 01:29:45.213
understand till you've done them --

01:29:45.279 --> 01:29:47.381
Such as billion for Medicaid --

01:29:47.448 --> 01:29:51.152
Some of our computer systems --

01:29:51.219 --> 01:29:51.786
Appeals an advocacy those sorts

01:29:51.853 --> 01:29:55.223
of things on going training we

01:29:55.289 --> 01:29:56.991
just --

01:29:57.058 --> 01:29:57.458
Surveyed our staff for

01:29:57.525 --> 01:29:59.360
priorities for training and we

01:29:59.427 --> 01:30:01.395
have monthly training at a

01:30:01.462 --> 01:30:02.029
minimum that's offered to our

01:30:02.096 --> 01:30:03.297
service coordinators for

01:30:03.364 --> 01:30:05.032
everything from.

01:30:05.099 --> 01:30:07.001
Health issues --

01:30:07.068 --> 01:30:09.103
Such as the importance of shall

01:30:09.170 --> 01:30:13.040
I said.

01:30:13.107 --> 01:30:15.376
Making sure that Bosnia properly --

01:30:15.443 --> 01:30:17.545
I know that's not an appropriate

01:30:17.612 --> 01:30:19.147
topic on one hand but on the

01:30:19.213 --> 01:30:21.249
other hand it is imperative to

01:30:21.315 --> 01:30:23.351
people's health and out at risk

01:30:23.417 --> 01:30:24.018
of high death if we don't manage

01:30:24.085 --> 01:30:27.054
that properly.

01:30:27.121 --> 01:30:29.357
And we also work on many other

01:30:29.423 --> 01:30:31.092
concepts --

01:30:31.159 --> 01:30:33.227
Not just medically related but

01:30:33.294 --> 01:30:35.296
also related to advocacy we

01:30:35.363 --> 01:30:37.498
doing adolescence of your

01:30:37.565 --> 01:30:39.400
mindset the State Council comes

01:30:39.467 --> 01:30:41.102
into strains for us.

01:30:41.169 --> 01:30:43.304
On I EPS another collaborative

01:30:43.371 --> 01:30:45.206
trainings we also have annual

01:30:45.273 --> 01:30:48.976
training surround mandated

01:30:49.043 --> 01:30:49.544
reporting and those sorts of

01:30:49.610 --> 01:30:51.112
things.

01:30:51.179 --> 01:30:53.414
So just one other question so I

01:30:53.481 --> 01:30:55.149
know there's it a differential

01:30:55.216 --> 01:30:56.984
and adult service coordinators

01:30:57.051 --> 01:30:59.520
and and the the motor service

01:30:59.587 --> 01:31:01.222
corners what is the average.

01:31:01.289 --> 01:31:04.992
Senses that you're coordinators

01:31:05.059 --> 01:31:05.560
in adult and minor actually

01:31:05.626 --> 01:31:07.128
service.

01:31:07.195 --> 01:31:09.363
Right now were at one to sixty

01:31:09.430 --> 01:31:09.797
eight which is --

01:31:09.864 --> 01:31:11.065
Lower compared to our peers in

01:31:11.132 --> 01:31:13.134
the state --

01:31:13.201 --> 01:31:15.036
But those numbers are rising.

01:31:15.102 --> 01:31:17.038
Overtime.

01:31:17.104 --> 01:31:19.006

I and I'm really sorry for him --

01:45:19.246 --> 01:45:19.780
So we just wanted to say thank

01:45:19.846 --> 01:45:22.983
you for this opportunity --

01:45:23.050 --> 01:45:25.285
When Amanda was born she was one

01:45:25.352 --> 01:45:27.087
would reverse effect that

01:45:27.154 --> 01:45:27.721
affected her brain development?

01:45:27.788 --> 01:45:31.591
And when when she was born they

01:45:31.658 --> 01:45:34.995
all said she wouldn't survive or

01:45:35.062 --> 01:45:35.562
a said she wouldn't mark she

01:45:35.629 --> 01:45:35.929
wouldn't talk.

01:45:35.996 --> 01:45:37.397
And because of these people.

01:45:37.464 --> 01:45:39.066
People like this.

01:45:39.132 --> 01:45:43.036
She walks into talks cincy does

01:45:43.103 --> 01:45:43.603
all kinds of things that

01:45:43.670 --> 01:45:45.038
surprises me on a daily basis

01:45:45.105 --> 01:45:45.338
[inaudible]

01:45:45.405 --> 01:45:49.076
And I'm her biggest sound.

01:45:49.142 --> 01:45:51.344
There are services that we can't

01:45:51.411 --> 01:45:51.678
we can't get.

01:45:51.745 --> 01:45:55.115
That other people can get

01:45:55.182 --> 01:45:57.117
because of the funding on and

01:45:57.184 --> 01:45:57.784
let me just give you an example

01:45:57.851 --> 01:46:01.054
we lived in Arkansas she when we

01:46:01.121 --> 01:46:03.056
women's harkens home she's three

01:46:03.123 --> 01:46:04.991
and we came back when she was.

01:46:05.058 --> 01:46:07.060
Thirteen I thought there's going

01:46:07.127 --> 01:46:07.694
to be the same services here.

01:46:07.761 --> 01:46:09.262
Pattern Arkansas I was sadly

01:46:09.329 --> 01:46:11.098
mistaken.

01:46:11.164 --> 01:46:13.166
She has so many more services.

01:46:13.233 --> 01:46:17.070
In Arkansas which is a much poor

01:46:17.137 --> 01:46:19.005
state Sen California's.

01:46:19.072 --> 01:46:21.174
And we came here and are so her

01:46:21.241 --> 01:46:25.178
services diminish a man slowly.

01:46:25.245 --> 01:46:25.812
Because the funding isn't here

01:46:25.879 --> 01:46:27.147
well how come it's there in

01:46:27.214 --> 01:46:27.414
Arkansas.

01:46:27.481 --> 01:46:29.316
How come it would help him she

01:46:29.382 --> 01:46:31.485
had therapy three and four times

01:46:31.551 --> 01:46:33.286
a week in here she had it once a

01:46:33.353 --> 01:46:35.021
year?

01:46:35.088 --> 01:46:37.257
I mean you explain that to me --

01:46:37.324 --> 01:46:39.359
So my point is is that if they

01:46:39.426 --> 01:46:41.461
can do that in other states why

01:46:41.528 --> 01:46:43.029
are we not doing here.

01:46:43.096 --> 01:46:43.630
I understand that there's more

01:46:43.697 --> 01:46:45.098
people per capita but these

01:46:45.165 --> 01:46:47.234
people work hard I mean and I

01:46:47.300 --> 01:46:49.436
see I've seen our we've been to

01:46:49.503 --> 01:46:51.037
several programs.

01:46:51.104 --> 01:46:51.638
Where a really good program

01:46:51.705 --> 01:46:53.340
right now but they need funding

01:46:53.406 --> 01:46:55.275
they need we need better people

01:46:55.342 --> 01:46:57.043
to take care of our kids?

01:46:57.110 --> 01:46:57.644
I'm so I'm leaving my daughter

01:46:57.711 --> 01:47:03.083

01:47:03.150 --> 01:47:03.350

02:00:09.602 --> 02:00:09.869
disabilities.

02:00:09.936 --> 02:00:11.370
And Jeff was born in.

02:00:11.437 --> 02:00:13.039
Seventy three and he was born

02:00:13.105 --> 02:00:15.074
right down the street.

02:00:15.141 --> 02:00:15.741
At my workplace Fresno community

02:00:15.808 --> 02:00:16.008
hospital.

02:00:16.075 --> 02:00:17.610
And the pediatrician came to my

02:00:17.677 --> 02:00:19.478
bedside a few hours after birth.

02:00:19.545 --> 02:00:21.180
And the pediatrician explain

02:00:21.247 --> 02:00:23.082
down syndrome.

02:00:23.149 --> 02:00:25.384
And explains how the normal

02:00:25.451 --> 02:00:27.553
course is to place the infants

02:00:27.620 --> 02:00:28.154
in an institution [inaudible]

02:00:28.220 --> 02:00:29.622
And then he said in the next

02:00:29.689 --> 02:00:31.324
sentence now however there is

02:00:31.390 --> 02:00:35.094
this brand new program called

02:00:35.161 --> 02:00:35.561
the regional center.

02:00:35.628 --> 02:00:37.463
And with this brand new program

02:00:37.530 --> 02:00:41.067
there are numerous advantages

02:00:41.133 --> 02:00:43.169
for your child [inaudible]

02:00:43.235 --> 02:00:47.139
And adds the age of four four

02:00:47.206 --> 02:00:49.141
days my husband and I were down

02:00:49.208 --> 02:00:52.979
on Shaw Avenue signing papers.

02:00:53.045 --> 02:00:55.181
For our son to be part of the

02:00:55.247 --> 02:00:59.051
process for the regional center.

02:00:59.118 --> 02:01:01.454
Tearful signing but we knew this

02:01:01.520 --> 02:01:03.289
was in his best interest because

02:01:03.356 --> 02:01:07.159
the alternative presented to us

02:01:07.226 --> 02:01:11.030
was an institution --

02:01:11.097 --> 02:01:15.134
So anyway CVR see has been part

02:01:15.201 --> 02:01:15.735
of Jeff throughout his entire

02:01:15.801 --> 02:01:17.069
life.

02:01:17.136 --> 02:01:19.138
Infant stimulation early

02:01:19.205 --> 02:01:21.273
education recreational

02:01:21.340 --> 02:01:25.111
experiences work employment and

02:01:25.177 --> 02:01:27.079
residential care.

02:01:27.146 --> 02:01:29.515
See the R. C. has allowed Jeff

02:01:29.582 --> 02:01:30.016
to Lee of in the least

02:01:30.082 --> 02:01:31.283
restrictive environment.

02:01:31.350 --> 02:01:35.054
And has allowed Jeff to reach

02:01:35.121 --> 02:01:37.156
his full potential.

02:01:37.223 --> 02:01:39.325
Throughout your life CVR city

02:01:39.392 --> 02:01:41.193
has been available to me Jeff's

02:01:41.260 --> 02:01:42.995
mother.

02:01:43.062 --> 02:01:45.331
See if you are C. hasn't

02:01:45.398 --> 02:01:45.898
reveille been available when

02:01:45.965 --> 02:01:46.999
needed.

02:01:47.066 --> 02:01:47.533
And I've learned that the

02:01:47.600 --> 02:01:49.435
managers are also Ridley

02:01:49.502 --> 02:01:51.103
available.

02:01:51.170 --> 02:01:53.305
They are approachable and they

02:01:53.372 --> 02:01:55.408
have a desire to resolve any

02:01:55.474 --> 02:01:57.309
concerns that I may have.

02:01:57.376 --> 02:01:59.011
I will give you one example.

02:01:59.078 --> 02:02:02.982
Jeff had attended a creative

02:02:03.049 --> 02:02:05.051
arts program for he learned to

02:02:05.117 --> 02:02:07.119
be a stage performer.

02:02:07.186 --> 02:02:09.355
And at and arts and I after

02:02:09.422 --> 02:02:13.592
about. Seventeen years of this

02:02:13.659 --> 02:02:15.327
program I received started

02:02:15.394 --> 02:02:17.296
receiving calls from the program

02:02:17.363 --> 02:02:21.067
manager about Jeff acting out.

02:02:21.133 --> 02:02:21.701
Jeff for sherry the cookie at

02:02:21.767 --> 02:02:25.071
lunch against rules.

02:02:25.137 --> 02:02:27.039
Jeff was not coming in a bad

02:02:27.106 --> 02:02:29.075
area day against roles.

02:02:29.141 --> 02:02:31.143
And so I said to Jeff Jeff

02:02:31.210 --> 02:02:33.312
what's going on Jeff being the

02:02:33.379 --> 02:02:35.214
Wiseman he said.

02:02:35.281 --> 02:02:39.085
I need a new boss.

02:02:39.151 --> 02:02:41.420
So I said I can't change that

02:02:41.487 --> 02:02:43.189
but you can go someplace else.

02:02:43.255 --> 02:02:45.257
And he said I can.

02:02:45.324 --> 02:02:47.393
I was so pleased I call the

02:02:47.460 --> 02:02:49.161
regional center.

02:02:49.228 --> 02:02:51.597
The case worker returned my call.

02:02:51.664 --> 02:02:55.101
The next day I explore.

02:02:55.167 --> 02:02:57.369
She was knowledgeable bill out

02:02:57.436 --> 02:02:59.538
every sort of program Jeff could

02:02:59.605 --> 02:03:01.107
attend.

02:03:01.173 --> 02:03:03.142
In the Tulare county area.

02:03:03.209 --> 02:03:05.111
She set up appointments for me

02:03:05.177 --> 02:03:09.148
to go to these different places.

02:03:09.215 --> 02:03:11.016
I narrowed it down.

02:03:11.083 --> 02:03:13.018
To one then we took Jeff.

02:03:13.085 --> 02:03:15.354
He loved it and he said I want

02:03:15.421 --> 02:03:17.289
to go there and the case worker

02:03:17.356 --> 02:03:19.258
sat down with him and says this

02:03:19.325 --> 02:03:21.127
means you have different friends

02:03:21.193 --> 02:03:21.527
you have different

02:03:21.594 --> 02:03:23.162
transportation.

02:03:23.229 --> 02:03:25.030
Your life will be different.

02:03:25.097 --> 02:03:27.099
He understood because she took

02:03:27.166 --> 02:03:29.168
time to talk to him the person.

02:03:29.235 --> 02:03:33.239
And then this is a work program

02:03:33.305 --> 02:03:35.040
so the now Jeff has a paycheck.

02:03:35.107 --> 02:03:37.143
He's excited to earn thirty

02:03:37.209 --> 02:03:39.078

02:03:39.145 --> 02:03:41.413

02:03:41.480 --> 02:03:43.048

02:03:57.196 --> 02:03:57.463

02:04:03.402 --> 02:04:13.112

02:07:27.072 --> 02:07:29.074
She probably knows more

02:07:29.141 --> 02:07:29.708
neighbors than I do she does

02:07:29.775 --> 02:07:31.477

02:07:47.426 --> 02:07:49.361
is active in and none of this

02:07:49.428 --> 02:07:51.330
happens without the support

02:07:51.397 --> 02:07:52.998
without the support of the

02:07:53.065 --> 02:07:53.599

02:07:53.665 --> 02:07:55.034

02:07:55.100 --> 02:07:57.236
They've all played a part --

02:07:57.302 --> 02:07:59.271

would have done without them --

02:08:11.383 --> 02:08:13.552
And then that this would have

02:08:13.619 --> 02:08:15.087
happened for her --

02:08:15.154 --> 02:08:17.022
The community needs people

02:08:17.089 --> 02:08:19.124
living with a disability to be

02:08:19.191 --> 02:08:21.060

02:08:23.128 --> 02:08:25.030
want to and with is that --

02:08:25.097 --> 02:08:27.299
Regional center has now

02:08:27.366 --> 02:08:29.034
committed to becoming a person

02:08:29.101 --> 02:08:29.601
centered thinking agency.

02:08:29.668 --> 02:08:31.503
I have the privilege to be a

02:08:31.570 --> 02:08:33.072
part of that project.

02:08:33.138 --> 02:08:35.207
And the user trainings that are

02:08:35.274 --> 02:08:37.076
ongoing for the staff there's

02:08:37.142 --> 02:08:39.178
internal activities for the

02:08:39.244 --> 02:08:41.080
staff to keep.

02:08:41.146 --> 02:08:42.981
The vision going.

02:08:43.048 --> 02:08:45.150
Of person centered planning.

02:08:45.217 --> 02:08:47.119
And the trainings are not just

02:08:47.186 --> 02:08:47.753
for the staff in the air it's

02:08:47.820 --> 02:08:49.588
equally as important that is for

02:08:49.655 --> 02:08:51.190
the community.

02:08:51.256 --> 02:08:53.092
So these trainings are given out

02:08:53.158 --> 02:08:55.194
in the community for parents for

02:08:55.260 --> 02:08:55.494
providers.

02:08:55.561 --> 02:09:01.133
And for anyone else that unity --

02:09:01.200 --> 02:09:03.102
So we can see an inclusive hold

02:09:03.168 --> 02:09:15.047
community in Fresno thank you.

02:09:15.114 --> 02:09:17.015
I think I'm gonna let you have

02:09:17.082 --> 02:09:17.616
the floor for a minute so you

02:09:17.683 --> 02:09:19.051
can.

02:09:19.118 --> 02:09:21.053
To show your feelings.

02:09:21.120 --> 02:09:23.188
We will start if I can to thank

02:09:23.255 --> 02:09:25.023
everybody who came but

02:09:25.090 --> 02:09:27.292
specifically the mother from

02:09:27.359 --> 02:09:29.094
kings park if I could --

02:09:29.161 --> 02:09:31.196
Your comment about your son

02:09:31.263 --> 02:09:35.033
ending with you his day being

02:09:35.100 --> 02:09:35.334
perfect --

02:09:35.400 --> 02:09:37.169
Reflects the feelings I have

02:09:37.236 --> 02:09:39.071
about today as well.

02:09:39.138 --> 02:09:41.340
There's times we can lose faith

02:09:41.406 --> 02:09:43.308
in our democracy in what we do

02:09:43.375 --> 02:09:45.077
by.

02:09:45.144 --> 02:09:47.079
What we hear?

02:09:47.146 --> 02:09:49.148
But there are moments like today

02:09:49.214 --> 02:09:51.116
that I'm reaffirmed in what it

02:09:51.183 --> 02:09:51.717
means to make our communities

02:09:51.783 --> 02:09:53.085
better.

02:09:53.152 --> 02:09:54.987
It's by advocates like you.

02:09:55.053 --> 02:09:57.456
Who come forward and give voice

02:09:57.523 --> 02:09:59.258
to the problems and the

02:09:59.324 --> 02:10:00.993
disenfranchised?

02:10:01.059 --> 02:10:03.095
And it's up to us the servant

02:10:03.162 --> 02:10:03.695
public service to do something

02:10:03.762 --> 02:10:05.097
about it.

02:10:05.164 --> 02:10:07.199
And so I look forward to the

02:10:07.266 --> 02:10:07.733
opportunities to working

02:10:07.799 --> 02:10:09.334
collaboratively with all of you

02:10:09.401 --> 02:10:11.003
who are here.

02:10:11.069 --> 02:10:13.172
No I hold hearings through the

02:10:13.238 --> 02:10:15.307
year and sub one and hope I see

02:10:15.374 --> 02:10:17.075
many of you continuing to be

02:10:17.142 --> 02:10:19.011
advocates in that form as well.

02:10:19.077 --> 02:10:21.079
We need all of our forces we

02:10:21.146 --> 02:10:21.680
need to all be rowing in the

02:10:21.747 --> 02:10:23.382
right direction and working

02:10:23.448 --> 02:10:25.050

02:10:31.123 --> 02:10:33.158
It's imperative that we in the

02:10:33.225 --> 02:10:35.060
valley feel like we get heard.

02:10:35.127 --> 02:10:37.362

02:10:49.241 --> 02:10:49.775

02:11:05.157 --> 02:11:05.524

process of getting this bill?

02:11:37.489 --> 02:11:39.024
Through the committees.

02:11:41.560 --> 02:11:43.028

02:12:05.651 --> 02:12:07.085
