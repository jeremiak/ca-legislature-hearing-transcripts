IN THIS BILL AND I. HAVING A

00:21:26.084 --> 00:21:29.588
BEER WHEN THEY PASSED SB. WHAT

00:21:29.655 --> 00:21:30.756
ONE HUNDRED I THINK IT WAS DALY

00:21:30.822 --> 00:21:35.127
OWNS BILL AND SO. TWO QUESTIONS

00:21:35.193 --> 00:21:38.230
ONE HOW THE FOR ABILITY PIECES

00:21:38.296 --> 00:21:41.099
SOMETHING THAT I AM VERY FOCUSED

00:21:41.166 --> 00:21:42.367
ON BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY

00:21:42.434 --> 00:21:45.237
IF WE CAN'T LEAD IN CALIFORNIA

00:21:45.303 --> 00:21:47.539
AND HAVE ENERGY RATES ARE FOR

00:21:47.606 --> 00:21:49.441
WHICH WE DON'T HAVE RIGHT NOW WE

00:21:49.508 --> 00:21:51.677
DO NOT HAVE FORMAL INVIGORATES

00:21:51.743 --> 00:21:53.612
IN AND IT'S- DESTROYING. THOSE

00:21:53.679 --> 00:21:56.148
FOLKS WHO ARE ON FIXED INCOMES

00:21:56.214 --> 00:21:59.251
OR- HOURLY WAGE EARNERS RIGHT

00:21:59.317 --> 00:22:01.119
NOW THAT'S THAT'S THE CASE. AND

00:22:01.186 --> 00:22:03.522
SO- WHAT IT WAT'S YOUR VISION

00:22:03.588 --> 00:22:06.124
FOR HOW IT'S ACTUALLY GOING TO.

00:22:06.191 --> 00:22:08.860
YOU KNOW STABILIZE OUR- OUR

00:22:08.927 --> 00:22:10.796
ELECTRICITY ELECTRICITY RATES

00:22:10.862 --> 00:22:12.731
THE VISION HAS AND ONLY FOR

00:22:12.798 --> 00:22:13.932
RESIDENTS ARE NOT NOT ONLY FOR

00:22:13.999 --> 00:22:15.367
RESIDENTIAL BUT FOR COMMERCIAL

00:22:15.434 --> 00:22:17.436
BECAUSE COMMERCIALS. WERE WE

00:22:17.502 --> 00:22:20.605
CAN'T CMPETE- IN CALIFORNIA IN

00:22:20.672 --> 00:22:21.606
NINETEEN CLOSE WITH OTHER STATES

00:22:21.673 --> 00:22:24.209
AND WE'RE LOSING A LOT OF THAT

00:22:24.276 --> 00:22:25.977
MANUFACTURING IN THOSE TYPES OF

00:22:26.044 --> 00:22:30.248
JOBS OUT OF OUR STATE AND THAT

00:22:30.315 --> 00:22:32.150
THAT INFRASTRUCTURE. WELL THE OF

00:22:32.217 --> 00:22:33.885
THE FOCUS AT THIS POINT IS ON

00:22:33.952 --> 00:22:35.420
RESIDENTIAL BUT WE WILL HAVE

00:22:35.487 --> 00:22:38.657
CONVERSATIONS OVER TIME THE REAL

00:22:38.724 --> 00:22:41.460
ISSUE IS THAT WE'VE PUT A LOT OF

00:22:41.526 --> 00:22:43.762
THE EXPENSES OF FORTY CARBONATE

00:22:43.829 --> 00:22:45.764
SESSION ON TO THE ELECTRICITY

00:22:45.831 --> 00:22:48.533
RATES. AND SO THE IDEA OF THE

00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:50.535
TRUST IS THAT WOULD LOWER RATES.

00:22:50.602 --> 00:22:54.740
ARE FOR EVERYONE BUT ESPECIALLY

00:22:54.806 --> 00:22:57.476
DO AN EXTRA. A PIECE FOR PEOPLE

00:22:57.542 --> 00:22:58.877
THAT ARE AT LOWER MODERATE

00:22:58.944 --> 00:23:02.681
INCOMES AND THE IDEA IS TO EASE

00:23:02.748 --> 00:23:05.283
EXACTLY THE CONCERN THAT YOU

00:23:05.350 --> 00:23:08.320
RAISED. AND THIS WOULD NEED TO

00:23:08.386 --> 00:23:10.455
BE FUNDED IN THE PROJECT BUT IT

00:23:10.522 --> 00:23:12.557
REALLY EXPRESSLY SAYS THAT IT

00:23:12.624 --> 00:23:14.593
CAN COME FROM ANY OF A NUMBER OF

00:23:14.659 --> 00:23:15.494
SOURCES WHETHER IT'S FEDERAL

00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:19.397
FUNDS. ARE- THE G. GRF FUNDS TO

00:23:19.464 --> 00:23:21.166
GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND

00:23:21.233 --> 00:23:23.635
THE GENERAL FUND OF THAT WE CAN

00:23:23.702 --> 00:23:24.903
TRY TO GET THERE WITH ANY

00:23:24.970 --> 00:23:28.740
FUNDING SOURCE THAT IS POSSIBLE

00:23:28.807 --> 00:23:30.108
TO FUND THE TRUST. AND AN

00:23:30.175 --> 00:23:32.744
APPLIED. TRY THEN THAT IF THERE

00:23:32.811 --> 00:23:34.713
WERE OTHER THINGS IN TERMS OF

00:23:34.780 --> 00:23:35.847
DECARBONISATION IT COULD FIT

00:23:35.914 --> 00:23:37.916
WITHIN THE TRUST BUT ARE THE

00:23:37.983 --> 00:23:40.552
PRIMARY FOCUS AT THIS POINT IS

00:23:40.619 --> 00:23:44.289
ON THE RICH. SO I'M NOT GONNA BE

00:23:44.356 --> 00:23:46.324
ABLE TO SPOT I DON'T. NOT A BILL

00:23:46.391 --> 00:23:48.860
SUPPORT YOUR BILL I THINK THAT

00:23:48.927 --> 00:23:51.730
THE AND REASON BEING IS THAT. WE

00:23:51.797 --> 00:23:54.599
DON'T WE BASICALLY. HAVE PASSED

THAT WORD THE RESIDENTIAL RATE

00:24:01.006 --> 00:24:03.074
ON THE BACKS OF THE COMMERCIAL

00:24:03.141 --> 00:24:04.609
INDUSTRIAL RATE THAT'S REALLY

00:24:04.676 --> 00:24:06.745
WHAT'S HAPPENING CALIFORNIA AND

00:24:06.812 --> 00:24:09.247
IF YOU'RE TAKING A PART OF MONEY

00:24:09.314 --> 00:24:11.016
TO HELP STABILIZE THOSE. LOWER

00:24:11.082 --> 00:24:13.418
INCOME FOLKS IT'S STILL A PART

00:24:13.485 --> 00:24:15.587
OF ME THAT COMES FROM SOMEWHERE

00:24:15.654 --> 00:24:17.489

SOMEWHERE ELSE WE'RE WE'RE

00:24:18.857 --> 00:24:20.225
PUTTING INTO THE FUNDS SO. I'M

00:24:20.292 --> 00:24:22.694

RATE LOWER THE RATES AT THE SAME

00:24:33.371 --> 00:24:35.073
TIME DOING THE RIGHT THING FOR

00:24:35.140 --> 00:24:35.841
THE ENVIRONMENT. I UNDERSTAND

00:24:35.907 --> 00:24:37.876
THAT PART OF IT BUT THE DEVIL'S

00:24:37.943 --> 00:24:38.476
IN THE DETAILS OF ACTUALLY OUT

00:24:38.543 --> 00:24:40.946
THAT. HAPPENS AND WHERE THE

00:24:41.012 --> 00:24:41.580
WHERE THE MONEY FLOWS FROM HONG

00:24:41.646 --> 00:24:44.015
KONG THAT'S- WHY I WAS TRYING TO

00:24:44.082 --> 00:24:45.517
GET MORE CLARIFICATION BUT- YOUR

00:24:45.584 --> 00:24:46.017

00:24:53.992 --> 00:24:56.494
RESIDENTIAL RATES. SEVEN

00:24:56.561 --> 00:24:57.796

REARRANGING THE PIE ON THIS IS

00:25:21.786 --> 00:25:23.622
BRINGING NEW RESOURCES TO THE

00:25:23.688 --> 00:25:25.223
ELECTRIC RATES TO DEAL WITH IT

00:25:25.290 --> 00:25:28.059
AND WE WILL BE HAPPY TO WORK

00:25:28.126 --> 00:25:28.860
OVERTIME TO SEE WHERE THAT GOES

00:25:28.927 --> 00:25:30.729
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE AS A

00:25:30.795 --> 00:25:32.030
PRIORITY WE DEAL WITH WITH

00:25:32.097 --> 00:25:33.732
INDIVIDUALS IN CALIFORNIA THAT

00:25:33.798 --> 00:25:34.866
ARE STRUGGLING WITH THEIR

00:25:34.933 --> 00:25:37.235
ELECTRICITY RATES. AND THEN WE

00:25:37.302 --> 00:25:39.204
CAN TAKE A LOOK AT IT AS IT

00:25:39.271 --> 00:25:40.639
MOVES ALONG BUT BUT IT IS

00:25:40.705 --> 00:25:43.642
BRINGING REVENUE INTO THE HELP

00:25:43.708 --> 00:25:45.477
WITH THE RATES TO DOESN'T EXIST

00:25:45.543 --> 00:25:47.045
NOW SO IT'S NOT LIKE WE ARE

00:25:47.112 --> 00:25:50.015
RANGING FROM ONE PERSON OR ONE

00:25:50.081 --> 00:25:54.753
ENTITY A BOOK WILL. OVER THIS IS

00:25:54.819 --> 00:25:56.054
. COMMITTEE BUT THAT'S AND

THAT'S WHY I'M ASKING THE COURT

00:25:57.422 --> 00:25:59.658

SAYING COMES FOR. WHO WEARS THAT

00:26:00.392 --> 00:26:02.560
POT IT'S FROM IT'S EXACTLY WHAT

I DESCRIBED IT IS. GENERAL FUND

00:26:03.728 --> 00:26:05.497
GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FEDERAL

00:26:05.563 --> 00:26:07.532
MONEY ANYWHERE ELSE THAT WE CAN

00:26:07.599 --> 00:26:08.733
GATHER IT TO DO WHICH IS SOME

00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:10.969
WE'VE NEVER DONE SO THIS IS THIS

00:26:11.036 --> 00:26:13.204
WHICH IS WHY I DECIDE. ASIDE

00:26:13.271 --> 00:26:15.373
FROM THE- I THINK WHAT WAS IT

00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:17.309
THE TWO BILLION THAT WE SET

00:26:17.375 --> 00:26:19.644

TO HELP A LOT OF STRUGGLING

00:26:38.797 --> 00:26:40.465
FAMILIES IT COULD AFFORD BILLS.

00:26:40.532 --> 00:26:41.900
BUT IT'S A BAD THING THAT YOU

00:26:41.967 --> 00:26:44.102
KNOW WE HAD TO DO BECAUSE OUR

00:26:44.169 --> 00:26:45.503
RATES ARE HIGH SO THIS BILL

00:26:45.570 --> 00:26:48.606
ATTEMPTS. TO ADDRESS. THE RATES

IN THE SECOND POINT WHEN YOU

00:27:00.051 --> 00:27:03.955
SPEAK TO THE TESTIMONY R. K. AS

00:27:04.022 --> 00:27:05.390

DEALING WITH CITING TRANSMISSION

00:27:14.199 --> 00:27:16.067
IN AN EASIER WAY. AND THERE WAS

00:27:16.134 --> 00:27:18.803
A CONCERN. THAT THE UNDERLYING

00:27:18.870 --> 00:27:21.006

A DESIRE FOR THAT CHANGE THAT'S

00:27:34.886 --> 00:27:36.287
APPROPRIATE FOR ANOTHER BILL

00:27:36.354 --> 00:27:37.622
THAT IS NOT APPROPRIATE FOR THIS

00:27:37.689 --> 00:27:40.125

HOW WHAT THE ENERGY EFFICIENCY

00:29:07.979 --> 00:29:10.548
IS OF THE STRUCTURE WHETHER IT'S

00:29:10.615 --> 00:29:12.884

IT. YOUR COULD BE DRY KIND OF

00:55:28.992 --> 00:55:33.563
SIFT THIS OUT YES- I'VE BEEN

00:55:33.630 --> 00:55:36.833
TRYING TO COME UP WITH THE- SO.

00:55:36.900 --> 00:55:38.968
LET'S SAY THERE WAS A NEW

00:55:39.035 --> 00:55:41.371
ADVANCEMENT IN OUR MANY YEARS

00:55:41.438 --> 00:55:43.673
REFRIGERATION NOT BECAUSE- I

00:55:43.740 --> 00:55:45.375
THINK THAT IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN

00:55:45.442 --> 00:55:47.343
HERE. BUT IF WE TAKE JUST THE

00:55:47.410 --> 00:55:50.280
CHANGE. IN APPOINT STANDARDS FOR

00:55:50.346 --> 00:55:51.614
TRADERS WHICH THE ENERGY

00:55:51.681 --> 00:55:54.050
COMMISSION PUT IN THE SEVENTIES

00:55:54.117 --> 00:55:56.352
THAT ALONE. DROPPED KEPT AND WE

00:55:56.419 --> 00:55:57.654
WHEN WE LOOK AT ALL THESE

00:55:57.721 --> 00:55:59.122
WONDERFUL THINGS CALIFORNIA'S

00:55:59.189 --> 00:56:00.490
DONE ALL THIS LEADERSHIP WHETHER

00:56:00.557 --> 00:56:01.991
IT'S IN RENEWABLE ENERGY- THERE

00:56:02.058 --> 00:56:04.160
SO THAT THE FACT THAT WE STILL

00:56:04.227 --> 00:56:07.397
USE PER CAPITA LESS ELECTRICITY.

00:56:07.464 --> 00:56:10.834
THAN WE DID IN NINETEEN SEVENTY

00:56:10.900 --> 00:56:12.302
TWO IS BECAUSE FARPOINT

00:56:12.368 --> 00:56:14.070
STANDARDS SIMPLY NOW AS WE

00:56:14.137 --> 00:56:15.705
ADVANCED AND WE TRIED TO GET

00:56:15.772 --> 00:56:18.541
100% RENEWABLE ENERGY AND WE

00:56:18.608 --> 00:56:20.510
ELECTRIFIED VEHICLES AS WE'RE

00:56:20.577 --> 00:56:22.278
ALL TALKING ABOUT THEIR SUPER

00:56:22.345 --> 00:56:25.615
MORE BAND ON THE HEAD AND- I'M-

00:56:25.682 --> 00:56:27.383
TEND TO BE LESS. WE WANT TO GO.

00:56:27.450 --> 00:56:28.485
RELY SO WE GOTTA HAVE NICK WALKS

00:56:28.551 --> 00:56:30.687
WE AGREED WE HAVE TO REDUCE OUR

00:56:30.754 --> 00:56:32.655
USE BUT WHY SHOULD WE BE GOING

00:56:32.722 --> 00:56:33.423
AROUND TELLING PEOPLE JUST

00:56:33.490 --> 00:56:35.492
UNPLUG YOUR STUFF NO. IF THERE

00:56:35.558 --> 00:56:37.660
IF THERE ISN'T B. SPENT IN A

00:56:37.727 --> 00:56:39.896
PARTICULAR POINT THAT BRINGS ITS

00:56:39.963 --> 00:56:42.899
ELECTRICITY DRAWDOWN 25% JUST

00:56:42.966 --> 00:56:43.867
LIKE THAT AND WE'VE SEEN THAT

00:56:43.933 --> 00:56:46.803
NOW. MANY OF OUR OUR CELL PHONE

00:56:46.870 --> 00:56:48.638
CHARGERS NOW ARE HAVE CUT THEIR

00:56:48.705 --> 00:56:51.074
USAGE OR LAPTOPS. WE HAVE THAT

00:56:51.141 --> 00:56:53.376
IF WE CAN MOVE IT AND GET IT ON

00:56:53.443 --> 00:56:55.879
THE MARKET FAST. THEN IT HELPS.

00:56:55.945 --> 00:56:58.681
AND RELIABILITY. WITH ALL OUR

00:56:58.748 --> 00:57:00.383
SCHOOLS NO I COULD WATERIS A

00:57:00.450 --> 00:57:02.418
BETTER EXAMPLE BUT I DON'T HAVE

00:57:02.485 --> 00:57:03.787
THE QUITE THE SAME ANALOGY. BUT

00:57:03.853 --> 00:57:04.854
YOU KNOW WE'RE HORRIBLE DROUGHT

00:57:04.921 --> 00:57:07.123
RIGHT NOW AND WE'RE ASKING

00:57:07.190 --> 00:57:09.225
RESIDENTS TO GO BACK TO REDUCE

00:57:09.292 --> 00:57:11.861
25% SAY. NOT TO YOU KNOW GET IS

00:57:11.928 --> 00:57:13.429
IT JUST TURN OFF FOR YOUR WATER

00:57:13.496 --> 00:57:15.832
OR WHAT IF. ALL OF OUR DIFFERENT

00:57:15.899 --> 00:57:19.569
DEVICES JUST USED 25% LESS WATER

00:57:19.636 --> 00:57:21.604
BUT WERE JUST AS EFFECTIVE. THEN

00:57:21.671 --> 00:57:23.640
IT WOULDN'T JUST BE ON OUR

00:57:23.706 --> 00:57:25.642
MEMORY TO TURN THIS OR THAT OFF

00:57:25.708 --> 00:57:27.177
RIGHT. SO THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT

00:57:27.243 --> 00:57:29.212
OF A BILL LIKE THIS IS IF AND

00:57:29.279 --> 00:57:31.548
WE'VE SEEN. ADVANCEMENTS COME

00:57:31.614 --> 00:57:33.950
VERY FAST AND IF THEY DO AND

00:57:34.017 --> 00:57:35.685
THEY CAN HELP US ADDRESS A

00:57:35.752 --> 00:57:37.153
CRITICAL PROBLEM OTHERS ARE

00:57:37.220 --> 00:57:39.055
DROPPED. THE GRID RELIABILITY

00:57:45.528 --> 00:57:48.331
LET'S SAY IT SAVES 45% OF THE

ENERGY RIGHT. I MEAN. I GUESS I

00:57:52.869 --> 00:57:54.470

REFRIGERATOR COMES UP WITH IT

00:58:44.020 --> 00:58:47.624
IT'S THAT THE INNOVATORS IN

00:58:47.690 --> 00:58:49.459
WHATEVER THAT TECHNOLOGY IS

FLEXIBLE IT CAN BE USED TO

01:00:54.951 --> 01:00:56.185
GENERATE ELECTRICITY THOUGH

01:00:56.252 --> 01:00:57.854
THAT'S GOING TO BE LESS COMMON

01:00:57.920 --> 01:00:58.821
IT CAN BE USED TO STORE

01:00:58.888 --> 01:01:00.790

GOVERNOR SCHWARZENEGGER WAS A

01:01:12.268 --> 01:01:13.970
HUGE OUT OF HYDROGEN BUT AT THAT

01:01:14.037 --> 01:01:15.571
POINT WE'RE PRODUCING MOST FOR

01:01:15.638 --> 01:01:18.107
HYDROGEN FROM FOSSIL FUELS DID

01:01:18.174 --> 01:01:20.176
NOT REALLY GIVE US MUCH. BETTER

01:01:20.243 --> 01:01:22.578

ABILITY TO PRODUCE HYDROGEN FROM

01:01:30.219 --> 01:01:32.922
. NON FOSSIL SOURCES AND THEN SO

01:01:32.989 --> 01:01:33.623
WE'RE ALREADY WE'RE NOT

01:01:33.689 --> 01:01:35.058
POLLUTING JUST IN THE PRODUCTION

BRILLIANCE OF IT IS LIKE TO SAY

01:01:39.462 --> 01:01:41.664
IT'S IT REPLACING DIESEL IN A

HYDROGEN INVESTMENTS AND CREATE

01:02:14.297 --> 01:02:16.666
A REGIONAL HYDROGEN HUB WE HAVE

01:02:16.732 --> 01:02:18.501
TO PUT SOME MONEY ON THE TABLE

01:02:18.568 --> 01:02:20.603

01:30:22.550 --> 01:30:24.485
WATERSHED THAT GOES INTO OR

FIND THAT COMES. THE CELL. THIS

01:30:32.026 --> 01:30:33.661
BILL TO HELP PREVENT THOSE.

01:30:33.728 --> 01:30:35.062

COMMENTS BY THANK YOU VERY MUCH-

01:30:41.836 --> 01:30:42.770
MISTER TURNER G. HONORED TO HAVE

01:30:42.837 --> 01:30:47.008
YOU SENATOR DOLLY- CO AUTHOR-

01:30:47.074 --> 01:30:48.810
YOU KNOW SOMETIMES WE GET CAUGHT

01:30:48.876 --> 01:30:50.778
UP IN TRYING TO FIND THE PERFECT

01:30:50.845 --> 01:30:52.613
SOLUTION. AND WHEN I COME TO

01:30:52.680 --> 01:30:54.582
LEARN OVER THE YEARS. IS THAT

01:30:54.649 --> 01:30:57.318
EVEN EVEN MY OWN IDEAS FOR

01:30:57.385 --> 01:31:00.121
PERFECT SOLUTIONS BY MAKE A VERY

01:31:00.188 --> 01:31:01.989
MORNING I THINK I GOT THE

01:31:02.056 --> 01:31:03.524
PERFECT SOLUTION. WELL BRING TO.

01:31:03.591 --> 01:31:05.760
FROM MY PERSPECTIVE. ON WHAT'S

01:31:05.827 --> 01:31:08.429
REALLY IMPORTANT IS WE HAVE A-

01:31:08.496 --> 01:31:10.464
AN ENERGY GRID THAT IS NOT

01:31:10.531 --> 01:31:13.501
SUSTAINABLE. AND WE HAVE A POWER

01:31:13.568 --> 01:31:15.069
PLANT WE'RE GOING TO BE TAKING

01:31:15.136 --> 01:31:17.071
OFF LINE IN JUST A FEW YEARS

01:31:17.138 --> 01:31:18.873
THAT PRODUCES 10% OF OUR ENERGY.

01:31:18.940 --> 01:31:21.075
SO OUR GRID WILL BE EVEN MORE

01:31:21.142 --> 01:31:24.745
UNSTABLE AND ON MY WATCH I DON'T

01:31:24.812 --> 01:31:27.215
WANT. US TO HAVE BLACKOUTS OR

01:31:27.281 --> 01:31:29.717
BROWNOUTS. WHERE ENERGY CEASES

01:31:29.784 --> 01:31:32.486
TO FLOW. BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T MADE

01:31:32.553 --> 01:31:35.790
PLANS NUMBER ONE AND NUMBER TWO

01:31:35.857 --> 01:31:37.225
IT HAPPENS DURING THE HOTTEST OR

01:31:37.291 --> 01:31:39.327
THE COLDEST TIME OF THE YEAR.

01:31:39.393 --> 01:31:41.028
AND SO THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT

01:31:41.095 --> 01:31:43.030
NUMBER NUMBER ONE NUMBER TWO IS.

01:31:43.097 --> 01:31:45.499
WE HAVE TO MAKE THE COMMITMENT

01:31:45.566 --> 01:31:46.968
FOR THINGS TO BE GREENER. AND

01:31:47.034 --> 01:31:49.303
PART OF THAT IS THAT THAT THE

01:31:49.370 --> 01:31:52.173
EXCEPT TECHNO. MAY PERFECT BUT

01:31:52.240 --> 01:31:53.908
IT'S BETTER WHAT WE RIGHT NOW

01:31:53.975 --> 01:31:55.676
AND- THE BURNING I HAVE TO. WITH

01:31:55.743 --> 01:31:57.812
SENATOR EGGMAN. WHEN OPEN AIR

01:31:57.879 --> 01:31:59.714
BURNING IS IT OCCURRING YOU CAN

01:31:59.780 --> 01:32:01.849
TASTE IT YOUR I. IT BURN AND YOU

01:32:01.916 --> 01:32:04.552
CAN FEEL IN YOUR- AND- DOESN'T.

01:32:04.619 --> 01:32:07.755
WAIT AND SO WE NEED TO DO

01:32:07.822 --> 01:32:09.457
SOMETHING WITH THE WEIGHT THE-

01:32:09.523 --> 01:32:15.463
NEW. AND. BIOMET US WITH AN- TO

01:32:15.529 --> 01:32:16.464

01:32:16.530 --> 01:32:18.599
WIND MAY NOT BE BLOWING AND THE

01:32:18.666 --> 01:32:20.301
SUN MAY NOT BE OUT. AND TO BE

01:32:20.368 --> 01:32:22.436
ABLE TO GET RID OF WASTE THAT

01:32:22.503 --> 01:32:24.538
THAT IS A PART OF A LIVING ON

01:32:24.605 --> 01:32:26.607
THIS EARTH AND SO IF WE CAN DO

01:32:26.674 --> 01:32:28.542
IT IN A WAY. THAT UPS AND MAKE

01:32:28.609 --> 01:32:30.077
SURE THAT WE'RE USING BARCODE

01:32:30.144 --> 01:32:31.646

BETTER THAN WE DID BEFORE AND

01:32:39.120 --> 01:32:41.322

ELEVEN NINETEEN BECAUSE- THE

01:34:36.704 --> 01:34:38.506
REASON PROJECT FOR A SUBSTANTIAL

01:34:38.572 --> 01:34:40.641
MODIFICATION. TO A SOUTHERN

01:34:40.708 --> 01:34:41.842
CALIFORNIA GAS COMPRESSOR

01:34:41.909 --> 01:34:44.412
STATION HAS CREATED A VERY

01:34:44.478 --> 01:34:45.846
DIFFICULT SITUATION FOR OUR CITY

01:34:45.913 --> 01:34:47.615
GOVERNMENT AND FOR OUR

01:34:47.681 --> 01:34:50.384
RESIDENTS. BECAUSE IN FIFTY FIVE

01:34:50.451 --> 01:34:52.653
OF PROJECT DOES NOT REQUIRED

01:34:52.720 --> 01:34:55.056
ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW. IS REALLY

01:34:55.122 --> 01:34:57.324
HARD TO UNDERSTAND WHY THERE IS

01:34:57.391 --> 01:34:58.692
NO ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW

01:34:58.759 --> 01:35:00.094
REQUIREMENTS FOR THIS TYPE

01:35:00.161 --> 01:35:02.430
PROJECT. BECAUSE WE AS A CITY

01:35:02.496 --> 01:35:04.331
GOVERNMENT HAVE TO PERFORM E. I.

01:35:04.398 --> 01:35:06.834
R. ALL THE TIME FOR OTHER TYPES

01:35:06.901 --> 01:35:07.868
OF PROJECT. FOR EXAMPLE A FEW

01:35:07.935 --> 01:35:09.570
YEARS AGO WHEN WE WERE CREATING

01:35:09.637 --> 01:35:10.971
OUR BOTANICAL GARDENS WITH.

01:35:11.038 --> 01:35:13.707
PLANTS IN DOUBT DROUGHT TOLERANT

01:35:13.774 --> 01:35:15.476
PLANTS WE WERE REQUIRED TO

01:35:15.543 --> 01:35:17.878
PERFORM E. R. AND A COUPLE OF

01:35:17.945 --> 01:35:23.484
WEEKS AGO OUR COUNCIL WAS HAVING

01:35:23.551 --> 01:35:25.753
A DISCUSSION ABOUT. THE LAW

01:35:25.820 --> 01:35:32.193
THANKS.

01:35:32.259 --> 01:35:33.260
SO IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT TO

01:35:33.327 --> 01:35:36.597
UNDERSTAND WHY A GAS COMPRESSOR

01:35:36.664 --> 01:35:39.100
STATION. CAN DO SUBSTANTIAL

01:35:39.166 --> 01:35:41.302
MODIFICATION WITHOUT GOING

01:35:41.368 --> 01:35:43.037
THROUGH THE ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW

01:35:43.104 --> 01:35:45.639
PROCESS. AND I MUST SAY I LIVE

01:35:45.706 --> 01:35:47.608
ABOUT A HALF MILE AWAY FROM THIS

01:35:47.675 --> 01:35:50.144
PARTICULAR PROJECT. AND I WAS

01:35:50.211 --> 01:35:52.113
NOT AWARE THAT THIS PROCESS WAS

01:35:52.179 --> 01:35:54.315
GOING ON. WE WERE NEVER INFORMED

01:35:54.381 --> 01:35:56.550
AS RESIDENTS. BUT TO MAKE

01:35:56.617 --> 01:35:58.819
MATTERS WORSE WE WERE ACTUALLY

01:35:58.886 --> 01:36:01.922
NEVER INFORMED AT THE CITY. OR

01:36:01.989 --> 01:36:03.724
DEPARTMENTS WERE NEVER INFORMED

01:36:03.791 --> 01:36:05.392
THAT THIS TYPE OF WORK WAS GOING

01:36:05.459 --> 01:36:06.560
TO BE HAPPENING. AND SO THAT'S

01:36:06.627 --> 01:36:08.929
WHY YOU THINK IT'S TIME FOR US

01:36:08.996 --> 01:36:10.664
TO REQUIRED ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW

01:36:10.731 --> 01:36:12.766
FOR THESE TYPES OF PROJECTS.

01:36:12.833 --> 01:36:16.770
BECAUSE WE'RE ASKING A LOT OF

01:36:16.837 --> 01:36:22.143
OTHER. PROJECTS GO. BUT NOT. THE

01:36:22.209 --> 01:36:25.379
STATIONS OR OTHER THE GAS MARKET

01:36:25.446 --> 01:36:28.349
SO I ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT.

01:36:28.415 --> 01:36:30.017
BECAUSE I KNOW THAT THIS BILL

01:36:30.084 --> 01:36:32.786
WILL NO LONGER AFFECT MY CITY

01:36:32.853 --> 01:36:35.122
BECAUSE IT'S NOT RETROACTIVE SO

01:36:35.189 --> 01:36:37.224
THERE UNFORTUNATELY IT WON'T

01:36:37.291 --> 01:36:38.792
REALLY HELP US IN OUR SITUATION

01:36:38.859 --> 01:36:40.427
BUT I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:36:40.494 --> 01:36:42.730
THIS TYPE OF SITUATION IF. IN

01:36:42.796 --> 01:36:45.266

01:46:33.620 --> 01:46:35.789
WHEN YOU BREAK IT DOWN. THAT

01:46:35.856 --> 01:46:36.590
DOESN'T THOSE ARGUMENTS DON'T

01:46:36.656 --> 01:46:37.891
TELL THE WHOLE STORY. RIGHT WE

01:46:37.958 --> 01:46:40.761
CAN QUANTIFY THE GAS TAX WE CAN

01:46:40.827 --> 01:46:42.496
QUANTIFY THE ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS

01:46:42.562 --> 01:46:47.100
. HI AND WE CAN CERTAINLY SEE.

01:46:47.167 --> 01:46:49.970
OUR COST INFLATION- R. AS IT

01:46:50.036 --> 01:46:51.671
WILL IT WILL BE BECAUSE WE CAN

01:46:51.738 --> 01:46:53.573
COMPARE OUR PRIDE OUR OUR PRICES

01:46:53.640 --> 01:46:54.608
HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

01:46:54.674 --> 01:46:57.911
AND THEN MATCH THEM UP TO. THE

01:46:57.978 --> 01:47:00.313
HIGHER COST HERE IN CALIFORNIA-

01:47:00.380 --> 01:47:02.282
AND IN THE END OF THE DAY WE

01:47:02.349 --> 01:47:04.151
STILL KNOW THAT THERE'S A PRICE

01:47:04.217 --> 01:47:05.452
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHEN YOU WE

01:47:05.519 --> 01:47:06.686
TAKE ALL THOSE THINGS INTO

01:47:06.753 --> 01:47:09.422
ACCOUNT THERE'S STILL A PRICE

01:47:09.489 --> 01:47:11.191
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT WE PAY

01:47:11.258 --> 01:47:12.125
HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND WHAT

01:47:12.192 --> 01:47:13.527
FOLKS PAY ENOUGH BATES AND NO I

01:47:13.593 --> 01:47:15.195
AM I CONTINUE I REMAIN

01:47:15.262 --> 01:47:16.463
UNCONVINCED. THAT I THINK SOME

01:47:16.530 --> 01:47:18.932
SUNLIGHT ON REFINING PRICING AND

01:47:18.999 --> 01:47:21.835
PRACTICES- IS GOING TO THREATEN

01:47:21.902 --> 01:47:22.669
THE PUBLIC. I THINK THERE IS

01:47:22.736 --> 01:47:24.771
THAT WE HAVE EVERYTHING WE HAVE

01:47:24.838 --> 01:47:26.239
A LOT TO GAIN FROM TRYING SOME

01:47:26.306 --> 01:47:27.674
MORE LIGHT ON THE ON THE PRICING

01:47:27.741 --> 01:47:29.376
STRUCTURE WHICH MEANS SO MUCH TO

01:47:29.442 --> 01:47:30.410
EVERYDAY PEOPLE. SO I'LL JUST

01:47:30.477 --> 01:47:32.345
GIVE AN EXAMPLE- THAT THAT I

01:47:32.412 --> 01:47:34.414
THINK IS AT THE HEART OF THIS.

01:47:34.481 --> 01:47:35.649
DOWN INTO MY NECK OF THE WOODS

01:47:35.715 --> 01:47:37.551
IN TWENTY FIFTEEN IT WAS A BIG

01:47:37.617 --> 01:47:39.419
EXPLOSION. AT THE TORRANCE

01:47:39.486 --> 01:47:40.620
REFINERY IS ONLY ABOUT SIX OR SO

01:47:40.687 --> 01:47:41.621
REFINERIES THAT ARE PRODUCING.

01:47:41.688 --> 01:47:43.290
THE SPECIAL BLEND OF GAP WE USE

01:47:43.356 --> 01:47:45.192
HERE IN SILICON. AND AND THE

01:47:45.258 --> 01:47:47.294
PRICES WENT UP SO YOU'RE BECAUSE

01:47:47.360 --> 01:47:49.129
THAT REFINERIES OFFLINE. THE

01:47:49.196 --> 01:47:50.530
PRICES WENT UP ABOUT A BUCK

01:47:50.597 --> 01:47:52.232
FIFTY A GALLON. IN THE IMMEDIATE

01:47:52.299 --> 01:47:54.234
AFTERMATH OF THE REFINERY. OUT

01:47:54.301 --> 01:47:56.369
BUT THE INTERESTING THING IS-

01:47:56.436 --> 01:47:58.438
YOKOHAMA'S PREDICTED THAT ONCE.

01:47:58.505 --> 01:47:59.973
THE REFINERY WAS BACK UP AND

01:48:00.040 --> 01:48:01.842
RUNNING THE PRICES WOULD JUST

01:48:01.908 --> 01:48:02.676
RETURN EXACTLY BACK TO NORMAL

01:48:02.742 --> 01:48:03.510
COURSE YOU'RE CORRECT FOR THE

01:48:03.577 --> 01:48:05.145
INTERNATIONAL. FLUCTUATION IN

01:48:05.212 --> 01:48:06.279
PRICES. OUT BUT THE INTERESTING

01:48:06.346 --> 01:48:07.881
THING IS. THE PRICES STATE

01:48:07.948 --> 01:48:09.583
INFLATED THEY CAME DOWN. BUT

01:48:09.649 --> 01:48:11.351
THEY NEVER CAME DOWN IT WENT UP

01:48:11.418 --> 01:48:13.053
ABOUT A BUCK FIFTY THEN THE

01:48:13.119 --> 01:48:14.621
PRICE CAME DOWN A LITTLE LESS

01:48:14.688 --> 01:48:16.356
THAN A DOLLAR. I AND FOR SEVEN

01:48:16.423 --> 01:48:18.225
YEARS NOW THE PRICES HAVE HAVE

01:48:18.291 --> 01:48:20.460
STATED. BAITED SO THIS BILL.

01:48:20.527 --> 01:48:21.561
AMONG OTHER THINGS WILL PROVIDE

01:48:21.628 --> 01:48:22.829
A CLEAR PICTURE JUST WHO'S

01:48:22.896 --> 01:48:24.764
PROFITING. AND TO WHAT EXTENT. I

01:48:24.831 --> 01:48:25.866
WOULD PROVIDE MORE SUNLIGHT IN

01:48:25.932 --> 01:48:27.467
AN INDUSTRY THAT WE KNOW IS

01:48:27.534 --> 01:48:29.302
MAKING REALLY STRONG PROFITS ALL

01:48:29.369 --> 01:48:31.471
YOU COULD DO IS TAKE A LOOK AT

01:48:31.538 --> 01:48:33.440
THEIR END. REPORTS WE'VE ALSO.

01:48:33.506 --> 01:48:34.741
VIEWING NO OPPONENTS OF ALSO

01:48:34.808 --> 01:48:35.475
FORCEFULLY ARGUED THE

01:48:35.542 --> 01:48:36.409
INFORMATION THAT WE WANNA MAKE

01:48:36.476 --> 01:48:37.911
PUBLIC WOULD ESSENTIALLY PUT.

01:48:37.978 --> 01:48:39.079
CONSUMERS AT RISK THAT'S AN

01:48:39.145 --> 01:48:40.146
ARGUMENT THAT THEY'VE BEEN

01:48:40.213 --> 01:48:41.715
MAKING. I KNOW- THEY CLEAN THAT

01:48:41.781 --> 01:48:44.017
THE DATA IS TO MARKET SENSITIVE-

01:48:44.084 --> 01:48:45.518
AND IT COULD BE USED BY CLEVER

01:48:45.585 --> 01:48:46.286
COMMODITIES TRADERS TO DRIVE UP

01:48:46.353 --> 01:48:48.288
THE COST OF GAS EVEN MORE I

01:48:48.355 --> 01:48:50.156
DON'T DISMISS THESE CLOUT THESE

01:48:50.223 --> 01:48:50.790
CLAIMS HAPHAZARDLY- BUT I WOULD

01:48:50.857 --> 01:48:52.792
KNOW IF YOU THINGS. WITH REGARD

01:48:52.859 --> 01:48:53.526
TO THIS ARGUMENT THE PRICING

01:48:53.593 --> 01:48:55.428
INFORMATION IN THE BILL. IS DATA

01:48:55.495 --> 01:48:56.496
THAT THE OIL COMPANIES HAVE

01:48:56.563 --> 01:48:59.900
ALREADY SHARED IN THE PAST WITH

01:48:59.966 --> 01:49:00.834
IN CALIFORNIA. IT STATED THERE

01:49:00.901 --> 01:49:01.868
PUBLICLY TRADED COMPANIES ARE

01:49:01.935 --> 01:49:05.005
YOU DISCLOSE. HOLDERS IT'S ALSO

01:49:05.071 --> 01:49:06.172
DATA THAT IN VERY FORMATS OIL

01:49:06.239 --> 01:49:06.840
COMPANIES ALREADY PUBLICLY

01:49:06.907 --> 01:49:09.009
DISCLOSED IN A NUMBER OF OTHER

01:49:09.075 --> 01:49:11.444
AMERICAN STATES. I IN AND OF

01:49:11.511 --> 01:49:13.246
COURSE IT'S ALSO DATA SHARED THE

01:49:13.313 --> 01:49:14.748
WAY AFTER THE FACT IS WHEN YOU

01:49:14.814 --> 01:49:16.616
CAN ENGAGE IN VERY EFFECTIVE

01:49:16.683 --> 01:49:17.617

ACCESS TO DATA. WITH REGARD TO

01:49:19.319 --> 01:49:21.721
PRICING BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:49:21.788 --> 01:49:23.623
A MONTH OR SO AFTER THE FACT. I

01:49:23.690 --> 01:49:25.492
AND OF COURSE IT DISCLOSURE THE

01:49:25.558 --> 01:49:27.327
STATE REALLY IS THAT RISKY WE AS

01:49:27.394 --> 01:49:28.295
LEGISLATORS TO TRUST THAT ARE

01:49:28.361 --> 01:49:30.063

WHERE THE PRICES- OF THE COSTS

02:01:30.216 --> 02:01:33.052
WILL ACTUALLY COME FROM. THAT

02:01:33.119 --> 02:01:35.788
WAS IN AND ENCOURAGE JEAN-

02:01:35.855 --> 02:01:37.857
EXPERIENCE I DID I CAME TO MY

02:01:37.923 --> 02:01:40.526
OWN CONCLUSIONS BUT I HIGHLY

02:01:40.593 --> 02:01:42.161
DOUBT THAT THOSE CONCLUSIONS.

02:01:42.228 --> 02:01:45.431
WERE ACCURATE BECAUSE WE THAT NO

02:01:45.498 --> 02:01:48.601

AFFECTS OF. PRICES BUT- BUT THE

02:02:07.753 --> 02:02:09.622
I HAVE FOUND THAT ONE OF THE

02:02:09.689 --> 02:02:11.891
MOST COMPLEX MARKETS IN THE

02:02:19.331 --> 02:02:22.501
HARD TO IMAGINE THAT- YOU KNOW

02:02:22.568 --> 02:02:24.804
SOME OF OFTEN THE CONDITIONS

02:02:24.870 --> 02:02:26.672
THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH RISING

02:02:26.739 --> 02:02:29.075
GAS PRICES. R. O. RESULT

02:02:29.141 --> 02:02:30.543
ACTUALLY ROCK OR A RESULT OF

02:02:30.609 --> 02:02:31.610
THOSE CONDITIONS BECAUSE IT

02:02:31.677 --> 02:02:33.646
DOESN'T MAKE SENSE IT'S NOT A

02:02:33.713 --> 02:02:35.214
FUNCTION OF WEATHER PATTERNS

02:02:35.281 --> 02:02:36.649
IT'S NOT A FUNCTION NOT EVEN OF

02:02:36.716 --> 02:02:38.617
WARS I MEAN WE KNOW THAT EVEN

02:02:38.684 --> 02:02:41.954
DURING WARS. OF THE IN SOME

02:02:42.021 --> 02:02:43.489
CASES I MEAN I UNDERSTAND IF

02:02:43.556 --> 02:02:44.957
THEY START PLAYING FIELD TONIGHT

02:02:45.024 --> 02:02:48.127
I UNDERSTAND THAT IF- EXTRACTION

02:02:48.194 --> 02:02:50.029
IN CERTAIN AREAS COMPLETELY COME

02:02:50.096 --> 02:02:51.964
TO A HALT. AND IF THAT'S

02:02:52.031 --> 02:02:53.299
MEASURABLE THAT WOULD DEFINITELY

02:02:53.365 --> 02:02:56.836
HAVE AN IMPACT. ON ON ON DEMAND

02:02:56.902 --> 02:03:00.773
ON A SUPPLY. BUT WHEN NOTHING IT

02:03:00.840 --> 02:03:02.308
IS SIX AFFECTING THE SUPPLY

02:03:02.374 --> 02:03:04.977
CHAINS IT SEEMS TO JUST TO HAVE

02:03:05.044 --> 02:03:07.213
A THIS VERY CAPRICIOUS EFFECT ON

02:03:07.279 --> 02:03:09.415
PRICES AND I THINK PEOPLE

02:03:09.482 --> 02:03:11.417
DESERVE TO KNOW WHAT THAT IS

02:03:11.484 --> 02:03:14.286
ESPECIALLY WHEN MANY. ARE

02:03:14.353 --> 02:03:16.822
COMPLETELY DEPENDENT ON THIS

02:03:16.889 --> 02:03:18.791
RESOURCE FOR THEIR DAILY LIVES

02:03:18.858 --> 02:03:22.461
THIS IS- AT ONE POINT IN HUMAN

02:03:22.528 --> 02:03:25.931
HISTORY SALT WAS CONSIDERED ON

02:03:25.998 --> 02:03:28.300
AN ISSUE OF NATIONAL SECURITY

02:03:28.367 --> 02:03:31.103
I'VE- BEEN TROLLED HIM. HIS IS

02:03:31.170 --> 02:03:32.705
ONE OF THOSE COMMODITIES THAT IS

02:03:32.772 --> 02:03:34.540
THAT RISES TO THE LEVEL OF

02:03:34.607 --> 02:03:36.575
NATIONAL SECURITY WE FIGHT FIGHT

02:03:36.642 --> 02:03:39.612
WARS OVER IT THERE ARE.

02:03:39.678 --> 02:03:41.580
CONFLICTS RELATED TO ACCESS

02:03:41.647 --> 02:03:43.849
UNIT. ABOUT FOR THE PEOPLE IN

02:03:43.916 --> 02:03:45.618
OUR STATE MANY ARE DEPENDENT

02:03:45.684 --> 02:03:47.953
UPON THIS FUEL SOURCE TO CONDUCT

02:03:48.020 --> 02:03:49.688
THEIR DAILY LIVES AND THEY'RE

02:03:49.755 --> 02:03:52.158
THEY'RE REALLY NO ALTERNATIVES

02:03:52.224 --> 02:03:54.260
FOR MANY PEOPLE. AND SIMPLY

02:03:54.326 --> 02:03:56.462
ASKING A DISCLOSURE I DON'T

02:03:56.529 --> 02:03:59.999
THINK WOULD AFFECT- COULD COME

02:04:00.065 --> 02:04:01.834
COMPETITION BETWEEN. OIL

02:04:01.901 --> 02:04:04.470
COMPANIES AND IF IT DOES LET'S

02:04:04.537 --> 02:04:05.604
LET'S INVITE A HEALTHY

02:04:05.671 --> 02:04:08.307
COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT. IF IT I

02:04:08.374 --> 02:04:10.142
DON'T I DON'T I DON'T BUY THAT

02:04:10.209 --> 02:04:14.113
ARGUMENT I THINK IT'S A SIMPLY A

02:04:14.180 --> 02:04:17.817
FUNCTION OF- AN INDUSTRY THAT

02:04:17.883 --> 02:04:19.285
HAS A PROTECTED STATUS IN TERMS

NUMBER COUNTRIES SO I DON'T

02:04:33.065 --> 02:04:37.803
THINK THIS IS AT ALL- AN EXTREME

02:04:37.870 --> 02:04:40.372
BILL I THINK IT'S- A VERY

02:04:40.439 --> 02:04:42.608
REASONABLE BILL WE WE'VE HAD

02:04:42.675 --> 02:04:44.476
TESTIMONY SAID IT'S BEEN DONE

02:04:44.543 --> 02:04:46.712

02:05:03.596 --> 02:05:05.531
ME TO EXPERIENCE THIS DEBATE

02:05:05.598 --> 02:05:07.900
ABOUT OIL PRICES BEING ALL ABOUT

02:05:07.967 --> 02:05:10.336
TAXES YET TAXES. CONTRIBUTE TO

02:05:10.402 --> 02:05:13.806
THE COSTS. DEFINITELY BUT THE

02:05:13.873 --> 02:05:15.708
CONVERSATION SHOULD BE LIMITED

02:05:15.774 --> 02:05:17.509
TO TAXES IT SHOULD BE LIMITED TO

02:05:17.576 --> 02:05:20.145
EVERYTHING ELSE. WENT WHEN THE

GALLON AND TAXES NEVER INCREASED

02:05:27.052 --> 02:05:29.488
. WHERE IS THAT CONVERSATION

02:05:29.555 --> 02:05:32.324
HAPPENED IN OUR STATE AND WHO IS

02:05:32.391 --> 02:05:34.660
BEING HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT

02:05:34.727 --> 02:05:39.465

THAT THIS IS A COORDINATED

02:06:01.654 --> 02:06:03.088
EFFORT I DON'T REALLY BELIEVE IT

02:06:03.155 --> 02:06:05.591
IS BY THE OIL COMPANIES BUT AT

02:06:05.658 --> 02:06:07.192
THE SAME TIME. SOMETHING IS

02:06:07.259 --> 02:06:08.727
HAPPENING THAT IS COMPLETELY

02:06:08.794 --> 02:06:11.530
UNFAIR. THAT IS TAKING ADVANTAGE

02:06:11.597 --> 02:06:14.033
OF A SITUATION THAT'S HAPPENING

02:06:14.099 --> 02:06:16.302

YEAR THERE'S A THOUSAND A

02:10:41.934 --> 02:10:42.968
THOUSAND NEW LAWS PASSED THE

02:10:43.035 --> 02:10:45.204
SEMI GONNA DEAL WITH. SO WE TALK

02:10:45.270 --> 02:10:47.472
ABOUT OIL IN CALIFORNIA AND

02:10:47.539 --> 02:10:50.542
GASOLINE AND WE HAVE- SPECIAL

02:10:50.609 --> 02:10:53.011
BLENDS. WE HAVE ALL KINDS OF

02:10:53.078 --> 02:10:54.746
THINGS AND I KNOW THAT YOU'RE

02:10:54.813 --> 02:10:55.447
SAYING YOU'RE TAKING ALL THAT

02:10:55.514 --> 02:10:57.216
INTO CONSIDERATION. BUT ALSO SET

02:10:57.282 --> 02:10:59.751
ON SUB TO. WHERE WE HAVE WE TALK

02:10:59.818 --> 02:11:02.154
ABOUT A THOUSAND WELLS SITTING

02:11:02.221 --> 02:11:03.522
AT CAL CHEN READY TO BE

02:11:03.589 --> 02:11:05.324
PERMITTED THAT THE OIL COMPANIES

02:11:05.390 --> 02:11:07.993
ACTUALLY PAY FOR THE REGULATORS

02:11:08.060 --> 02:11:09.461
TO OUT REGULATE. AND THEY'RE NOT

02:11:09.528 --> 02:11:11.363
GETTING RATE THEY'RE NOT GETTING

02:11:11.430 --> 02:11:12.564
OPENED UP. SO WE START TALKING

02:11:12.631 --> 02:11:14.900
ABOUT OIL AND FOR SOME REASON.

02:11:14.967 --> 02:11:17.569
OIL IS LIKE. THE ANTI CHRIST

02:11:17.636 --> 02:11:22.474
AROUND HERE. CABALLERO CAME IN

02:11:22.541 --> 02:11:24.276
FRONT OF OUR COMMITTEE WE CAN GO

02:11:24.343 --> 02:11:26.945
TRYING TO DO CARBON CAPTURE AND

02:11:27.012 --> 02:11:28.714
THEY WANT TO SAY NOPE YOU WE CAN

02:11:28.780 --> 02:11:30.849
DO EVERYTHING BUT OIL. WHAT SO I

02:11:30.916 --> 02:11:32.718
KNOW AND WE'VE SEEN IT IT THE

02:11:32.784 --> 02:11:33.819
PRESIDENT UNITED STATES IS

02:11:33.885 --> 02:11:34.953
TALKING ABOUT COMPANIES ARE

02:11:35.020 --> 02:11:37.356
GOUGING BECAUSE INFLATION IS

02:11:37.422 --> 02:11:39.558
GOING UP THAT'S B. S. THE REASON

02:11:39.625 --> 02:11:40.425
WE HAVE INFLATION IS COULD WE

02:11:40.492 --> 02:11:43.829
STOP TROOP FOUR TRILLION DOLLARS

02:11:43.895 --> 02:11:45.597
INTO OUR ECONOMY. AND YOU YOU IF

02:11:45.664 --> 02:11:47.766
YOU'RE GONNA PLACE AND WHEN YOU

02:11:47.833 --> 02:11:49.901
DO THAT. NATIONWIDE I'M IN

02:11:49.968 --> 02:11:52.004
BUSINESS I AM GETTING THE DIRECT

02:11:52.070 --> 02:11:54.306
EFFECTS OF. THE INFLATION IS

02:11:54.373 --> 02:11:56.241
DRIVING UP AND I HAVE TO PASS

02:11:56.308 --> 02:11:57.509
THAT COST ON AND THAT'S WHAT'S

02:11:57.576 --> 02:11:59.344
DRIVING UP EVERYTHING IS NOT

02:11:59.411 --> 02:12:00.779
GOING TO GO AWAY ANYTIME SOON NO

02:12:00.846 --> 02:12:01.880
MATTER. WHO'S MAKING PROFITS ARE

02:12:01.947 --> 02:12:03.515
NOT. SO I THINK THAT WE NEED IS

02:12:03.582 --> 02:12:06.184
YOU KNOW FOCUS MORE ON HOW DO WE

02:12:06.251 --> 02:12:08.553
ACTUALLY DRIVE THE COST DOWN. WE

02:12:08.620 --> 02:12:10.455
DON'T PRODUCE MORE THE WAY YOU.

02:12:10.522 --> 02:12:12.557
THE WAY IT HERE AT HOME. THE WAY

02:12:12.624 --> 02:12:14.760
YOU DRIVE THE COST DOWN TO

02:12:14.826 --> 02:12:15.527
SUPPLY AND DEMAND WHICH THAT

02:12:15.594 --> 02:12:17.062
WHICH CHAIR TALKED ABOUT. I'M IN

02:12:17.129 --> 02:12:19.631
THE C. BUSINESS. THE ONLY TIME I

02:12:19.698 --> 02:12:21.133
REALLY MAKE MONEY IS WHEN

02:12:21.199 --> 02:12:22.534
SOMEBODY ELSE LOSES MONEY.

02:12:22.601 --> 02:12:24.236
BECAUSE WE SEE WHAT I WHAT I

02:12:24.303 --> 02:12:25.304
MEAN BY THAT THE WEATHER

02:12:25.370 --> 02:12:26.471
SOMEWHERE CHANGED. BECAUSE WE

02:12:26.538 --> 02:12:28.273
PRODUCE PLENTY OF FOOD. BUT THE

02:12:28.340 --> 02:12:29.508
TIME I ACTUALLY MAKE MONEY IS

02:12:29.574 --> 02:12:30.742
WHEN THERE'S A DROUGHT SOMEWHERE

02:12:30.809 --> 02:12:32.411
ELSE WHETHER SOME FLUCTUATIONS

02:12:32.477 --> 02:12:34.246
NOW IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE IN

02:12:34.313 --> 02:12:35.247
CALIFORNIA. WHEN YOU HAVE TO

02:12:35.314 --> 02:12:36.782
DOLLAR GALLON FUEL HIGHER THAN

02:12:36.848 --> 02:12:37.883
ANYWHERE ELSE YOUR LETTER GRADES

02:12:37.949 --> 02:12:40.585
ARE HIGHER. YOUR YOUR- WAGES ARE

02:12:40.652 --> 02:12:42.321
HIGHER ALL THE SINGER OF

02:12:42.387 --> 02:12:43.488
CALIFORNIA YOU'RE COMPETING

02:12:43.555 --> 02:12:45.290
AGAINST OTHER STATES. IN THIS

02:12:45.357 --> 02:12:48.360
CASE FOR OIL IT'S THE RATE WE

02:12:48.427 --> 02:12:50.529
HAVE SPECIAL BLENDS. SO I THINK

02:12:50.595 --> 02:12:52.164
WE NEED TO DO WE DID YOU KNOW IF

02:12:52.230 --> 02:12:53.532

COMPANIES YOU WANT TO BLAME. THE

02:12:55.901 --> 02:12:57.836
END OF THE DAY WE NEED MORE OIL.

02:12:57.903 --> 02:12:59.671
AND WE CUT TALK ABOUT WINNING

02:12:59.738 --> 02:13:00.672
HIM OFF THEY GOING TO ELECTRIC

02:13:00.739 --> 02:13:02.607
CARS. IN OUR GREAT ISN'T SET UP

02:13:03.809 --> 02:13:05.277
COME OUT WHEN YOU SIT DOWN TO

02:13:05.344 --> 02:13:07.946

PRICE GOES UP AND THEY MAKE SOME

02:13:16.755 --> 02:13:18.824
MONEY TO STAY IN BUSINESS. YOUR

FROM MY COLLEAGUES IN THIS IS BY

02:14:27.092 --> 02:14:29.928
HIS BILL WHILE DAY THIS BUILDING

02:14:29.995 --> 02:14:34.733
- BREVARD BODY- I AGREE WITH

02:14:34.800 --> 02:14:37.302
WITH MANY THINGS THAT WERE SAID

02:14:37.369 --> 02:14:40.539
ON BOTH SIDES OF THIS ISSUE-

02:14:40.605 --> 02:14:43.842

DO IN THIS BUILDING TO NOT

02:14:47.913 --> 02:14:51.082
IMPACT WHAT OCCURS IN THE

02:14:51.149 --> 02:14:53.218
MARKETPLACE AND THE OVERALL

02:14:53.285 --> 02:14:54.719
CALCULUS OF DOING BUSINESS IN

02:14:54.786 --> 02:14:56.655
CALIFORNIA NO WAS UNDER ANY

02:14:56.721 --> 02:14:59.024
ILLUSION THAT CALIFORNIA IS A

02:14:59.090 --> 02:15:02.627
PRO BUSINESS STATE- THERE ARE

02:15:02.694 --> 02:15:04.996
DESIGNATED- WINNERS. AND THEY'RE

02:15:05.063 --> 02:15:08.834
CERTAINLY. DESIGNATED LOSERS-

02:15:08.900 --> 02:15:12.237
BUT AT THE SAME TIME I HAVE A

02:15:12.304 --> 02:15:15.907
SOFT SPOT WHEN INDIVIDUALS ARE

02:15:15.974 --> 02:15:16.975
LOOKING INTO MATTERS ON THE

02:15:17.042 --> 02:15:21.179
MERITS. AND IF THERE IS A IF

02:15:21.246 --> 02:15:24.249
THERE IS A TRUE INQUIRY TO TRY

02:15:24.316 --> 02:15:26.985
TO FIGURE OUT WHERE THE

02:15:27.052 --> 02:15:29.254
CHOKEPOINTS ARE THAT ARE

02:15:29.321 --> 02:15:32.224
EXAGGERATING THE COSTS OF FUEL.

02:15:32.290 --> 02:15:34.993
I THINK THAT COULD BE HELPFUL TO

02:15:35.060 --> 02:15:37.496
FIND THE PROBLEM IS I DON'T

02:15:37.562 --> 02:15:39.664
NECESSARILY TRUST. THE

02:15:39.731 --> 02:15:42.067
CONFIGURATION OF WHO WOULD HAVE

02:15:42.133 --> 02:15:43.902
ACCESS TO THAT INFORMATION AND

02:15:43.969 --> 02:15:46.137
HOW IT WOULD BE ASSEMBLED SO YOU

02:15:46.204 --> 02:15:48.473
KNOW I HAD CONVERSATIONS AND-

02:15:48.540 --> 02:15:50.809
YOU ARE A MAN OF YOUR WORD AS A

02:15:50.876 --> 02:15:53.612
LEGISLATOR IN A PERSON- BUT I

02:15:53.678 --> 02:15:55.514
WOULD I WANTED TO THROW THIS OUT

02:15:55.580 --> 02:15:57.315
THERE MAYBE YOU CAN COMMENT ONE

02:15:57.382 --> 02:15:59.718
OF THE ISSUES THAT I HAD I

02:15:59.784 --> 02:16:00.785
BROUGHT UP TO YOU IS.

02:16:00.852 --> 02:16:02.220
CONFIDENTIALITY WE'RE TALKING A

02:16:02.287 --> 02:16:04.789
PUBLICLY TRADED ENTITIES WE'RE

02:16:04.856 --> 02:16:06.725
THE REFINEMENT COSTS. ARE

02:16:06.791 --> 02:16:08.627
ESSENTIALLY PROPRIETARY PIECES

02:16:08.693 --> 02:16:10.395
OF INFORMATION. THAT CAN BE

02:16:10.462 --> 02:16:12.497
EXPLOITED BY MANIPULATOR AS WE

02:16:12.564 --> 02:16:15.367
HEARD FROM SENATOR MAN EARLIER.

02:16:15.433 --> 02:16:16.868
THAT YOU CAN'T JUST **** NILLY

02:16:16.935 --> 02:16:18.303

02:16:18.370 --> 02:16:19.871
INFORMATION INTO THE PUBLIC

02:16:19.938 --> 02:16:21.806
DOMAIN AND NOT EXPECT THERE BE

02:16:21.873 --> 02:16:23.742
TO BE ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES. AND

02:16:23.808 --> 02:16:26.244
SO WE'RE IS THERE A REASONABLE

02:16:26.311 --> 02:16:29.347
PATH FORWARD- WE HAVE A HISTORY

02:16:29.414 --> 02:16:32.450

THE STATE TO LOOK INTO THESE

02:16:45.597 --> 02:16:46.898

OF WHERE ARE THE INFLATIONARY

02:16:56.741 --> 02:16:59.411
CHIP- CHOKEPOINTS. BECAUSE YES

02:16:59.477 --> 02:17:02.247
RUSSIA HAS EXAGGERATED THE COSTS

02:17:02.314 --> 02:17:04.950
YES UKRAINE HAS EXAGGERATED THE

02:17:05.016 --> 02:17:07.619
COSTS. BUT SO HAS REGULATION IN

02:17:07.686 --> 02:17:09.788

OVERHEAD- TAXES THAT WE THAT WE

MORE OF AN INCREASE TO YOU. HOW

02:17:16.861 --> 02:17:18.964
WOULD YOU REALISTICALLY SPLIT

02:17:19.030 --> 02:17:22.233
THIS BABY IN SUCH A WAY THAT.

02:17:22.300 --> 02:17:25.337
THE INDUSTRY FEELS THAT

ARE SO MANY FACTORS AT PLAY

02:20:21.146 --> 02:20:22.680

WOULDN'T THIS BE FASHIONED AS A

02:20:39.130 --> 02:20:40.899
COMMISSIONED THING TANK

02:20:40.965 --> 02:20:45.003
INVESTIGATION. BECAUSE THE IDEA

02:20:45.069 --> 02:20:46.471
OF PUBLICLY DISCLOSING IT

02:20:46.538 --> 02:20:49.107
PRESUPPOSES THAT THERE'S NO

02:20:49.174 --> 02:20:53.311
VARIOUS ACTIONS A PLAY. AND THIS

02:20:53.378 --> 02:20:56.981
ONEROUS MONTHLY THING- THE IDEA

02:20:57.048 --> 02:20:58.983
WOULD BE TO KIND OF WE GOT WE

02:20:59.050 --> 02:21:01.653
GOT A MOMENT IN TIME THAT YOU'RE

02:21:01.719 --> 02:21:03.655
GOING TO HAVE TO USE IT AS A

02:21:03.721 --> 02:21:06.357
SAMPLE. COULDN'T POINTSTREAK BE

CREATE SOME SORT OF. PASK FORCE

02:21:19.070 --> 02:21:20.605
OR BEEF UP THE EXISTS FOR

02:21:20.672 --> 02:21:21.906
STRUCTURE AND SEE YOU SEE THAT

02:21:21.973 --> 02:21:23.575
IS SOME SOMETHING THAT ACHIEVES

02:21:23.641 --> 02:21:25.376
WHAT YOU WANT BECAUSE IF WHAT

02:21:25.443 --> 02:21:27.345
YOU WANT IS TO FIND OUT WHERE

02:21:27.412 --> 02:21:29.280
THOSE POINTS ARE. THAT I THINK

02:21:29.347 --> 02:21:30.615
COULD BE SMARTER AND MORE

02:21:30.682 --> 02:21:35.186
EFFICIENT FOR US- TO A CHOIR THE

02:21:35.253 --> 02:21:37.755
INFORMATION IN THE IN CAMERA

02:21:37.822 --> 02:21:41.125
CONFIDENTIAL WAY. BECAUSE I WAS

02:21:41.192 --> 02:21:42.894
GOING TO OPPOSE THIS OUT OF THE

02:21:42.961 --> 02:21:44.395
GATE THE FACT THAT IT WAS GOING

02:21:44.462 --> 02:21:45.430

02:21:45.496 --> 02:21:47.799
DRAFT WAS PUBLIC DISCLOSURE LIKE

02:21:47.866 --> 02:21:51.970

02:22:07.852 --> 02:22:09.687
EXACTLY WHAT I THINK. YOU COULD

02:22:09.754 --> 02:22:11.956
COULD BE DONE IS THAT IF THIS

02:22:12.023 --> 02:22:13.658
WERE IN A THINK TANK FORMAT. IN

02:22:13.725 --> 02:22:16.561

02:22:16.628 --> 02:22:18.429

AND IT'S WITHIN A REFINED PERIOD

02:22:20.498 --> 02:22:23.968
OF TIME- I THINK THAT WOULD BE

02:22:24.035 --> 02:22:27.238

HAVE THE COST OF WHAT THE COST

02:23:00.638 --> 02:23:02.373
OF PAYROLL TAXES ALL THE THINGS

THAT NEED TO BE TAKEN IN THE

02:23:09.447 --> 02:23:11.883

BUT THE WHAT WHAT WORRIES ME

02:23:23.227 --> 02:23:25.530
ABOUT THE DISCUSSION IS THAT.

02:23:25.596 --> 02:23:26.664
WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE IT SEEM

02:23:26.731 --> 02:23:28.399
LIKE YOU KNOW THESE ARE MY-

02:23:28.466 --> 02:23:31.736
SHOPS. AND THAT THAT OUR OUR

02:23:31.803 --> 02:23:34.305
REGULATIONS ARE CAUSE FOR THE-

02:23:34.372 --> 02:23:36.574
THE PRICING. AND THE TRUTH IS I

02:23:36.641 --> 02:23:38.710
MEAN THESE ARE COMPANIES A LOT

02:23:38.776 --> 02:23:39.444
OF THEM ARE NOT BASED IN

02:23:39.510 --> 02:23:41.112
CALIFORNIA YOU CAN'T ATTRIBUTE

02:23:41.179 --> 02:23:44.048
THAT COST. TO COMPANIES I MEAN

02:23:44.115 --> 02:23:45.750
THESE ARE COMPANIES THAT MAKE UP

02:23:45.817 --> 02:23:48.653
A FOUR HUNDRED BILLION DOLLAR.

02:23:48.720 --> 02:23:50.021
INDUSTRY WORLDWIDE THAT

02:23:50.088 --> 02:23:53.591
REPRESENTS THREE POINT 8% OF THE

02:23:53.658 --> 02:23:55.693
ENTIRE WORLD ECONOMY. SO WE'RE

02:23:55.760 --> 02:23:57.328

REGULATION IN PARTICULAR YES OF

02:24:01.499 --> 02:24:03.601
COURSE. THERE AFFECTED I THINK

02:24:03.668 --> 02:24:05.903
SOME MOST REGULATIONS CALIFORNIA

02:24:05.970 --> 02:24:07.472
PERTAIN TO SAFETY AN EXTRACTION

02:24:07.538 --> 02:24:09.474
IN THE ENVIRONMENT. IN TERMS OF

MY EXPERIENCE HERE BUT WHEN YOU

02:24:11.909 --> 02:24:15.646
LOOK AT THE LARGEST. OIL COMPANY

02:24:15.713 --> 02:24:17.749
EREMENKO THEY'RE NOT EVEN FROM

02:24:17.815 --> 02:24:20.284
CALIFORNIA AND THERE ARE MASSIVE

02:24:20.351 --> 02:24:23.087
IF YOU CONSIDER EXXON IS NUMBER

02:24:23.154 --> 02:24:24.422
TWO ON THE FORTUNE FIVE HUNDRED

02:24:24.489 --> 02:24:26.958
LIST. AND THEIR THIRD IN THE

02:24:27.025 --> 02:24:28.960
WORLD LIST I MEAN WE'RE TALKING

02:24:29.027 --> 02:24:31.662
ABOUT EREKLE BRIDGE PETROLEUM

02:24:31.729 --> 02:24:33.231
EXXON CHEVRON THE CERTAIN SET

02:24:33.297 --> 02:24:35.500
OF. COMPANIES THAT HAVE A HUGE

IMPORTANT HISTORICALLY THE MOST

02:38:54.424 --> 02:38:56.260
