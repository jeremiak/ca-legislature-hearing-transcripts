VOTED FOR IT- YOU HAVE SINCE

IT'D GONE THROUGH OTHER

00:25:41.373 --> 00:25:41.973
COMMITTEES AND WHAT THE

00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:43.375
RATIONALE BEHIND THAT IS

00:25:43.441 --> 00:25:44.276
BECAUSE I KNOW THAT'S- THE ONE

00:25:44.342 --> 00:25:46.411
PROVISION THAT'S GOT THE

00:25:46.478 --> 00:25:46.978
STAKEHOLDERS VERY CONCERNED

00:25:47.045 --> 00:25:49.948
ABOUT IT. THANK YOU SIR IT WAS

00:25:50.015 --> 00:25:52.350
A SUGGESTION- I BELIEVE OF YOUR

00:25:52.417 --> 00:25:55.553
COMMITTEE STAFF. AND I'M OKAY

00:25:55.620 --> 00:25:57.889
WITH IT- IT HAS CREATED LITTLE

00:25:57.956 --> 00:25:59.057
CONSTERNATION WITH THE

00:25:59.124 --> 00:26:02.160
REALTORS. BUT I THINK WORK IN I

00:26:02.227 --> 00:26:02.727
BELIEVE WE CAN WORK THROUGH

00:26:02.794 --> 00:26:05.497
THESE ISSUES- I DON'T KNOW IF

00:26:05.563 --> 00:26:07.632
MATT WANTS TO COMMENT ON THE-

00:26:07.699 --> 00:26:10.235
ON THAT PROVISION. SURE THIS IS

00:26:10.302 --> 00:26:12.437
THE PROVISION THAT HAS HELD UP

00:26:12.504 --> 00:26:14.706
THIS BILL OVER THE YEARS- ON.

00:26:14.773 --> 00:26:17.108
MY OWN MEMBERS IN THE PAST HAVE

00:26:17.175 --> 00:26:19.477
HAD A LITTLE CONCERN WITH THIS

00:26:19.544 --> 00:26:20.211
WE OF COURSE WOULD LOVE TO BE

00:26:20.278 --> 00:26:22.347
ABLE TO FORM LLC'S WITH- OUT

00:26:22.414 --> 00:26:24.416
THE STATE REQUIRING HAVE ANY

00:26:24.482 --> 00:26:26.651
REPORTING OR ANY INSURANCE- BUT

00:26:26.718 --> 00:26:27.986
WE THINK WHAT'S BEEN PUT IN THE

00:26:28.053 --> 00:26:29.387
BILL IS REASONABLE. THEY WERE

00:26:29.454 --> 00:26:32.090
BUILT ON- SOME REQUIREMENTS

00:26:32.157 --> 00:26:33.892
THAT WERE IN A PART A BILL IN

00:26:33.959 --> 00:26:37.262
THE MID TWO THOUSANDS. AB WE

00:26:37.329 --> 00:26:37.862
WENT OUT AND CHECKED WITH OUR

00:26:37.929 --> 00:26:39.297
MEMBERSHIP ON THIS- WITH SOME

00:26:39.364 --> 00:26:40.832
COMPANIES YOU. CURRENTLY KERRY

00:26:40.899 --> 00:26:43.268
INSURANCE AS BEING A C. CORP-

00:26:43.335 --> 00:26:44.536
THE MINIMUMS THAT ARE CURRENTLY

00:26:44.602 --> 00:26:46.504
IN THE BILL WE FEEL ARE A VERY

00:26:46.571 --> 00:26:48.406
REACHABLE FOR MOST COMPANIES.

00:26:48.473 --> 00:26:51.076
THAT WOULD LOOK INTO DOING THIS.

00:26:51.142 --> 00:26:52.610
SO LET ME TOTAL DOWN ON

00:26:52.677 --> 00:26:53.712
SOMETHING THAT YOU JUST SAID

00:26:53.778 --> 00:26:55.513
SO- I UNDERSTAND THE ARGUMENT

00:26:55.580 --> 00:26:58.383
THAT. ALLOWING INCORPORATION AS

00:26:58.450 --> 00:27:00.585
AN LLC PROVIDES A LIABILITY

00:27:00.652 --> 00:27:02.187
SHIELD AND MAYBE THAT'S A

00:27:02.253 --> 00:27:03.488
REASON WHY INSURANCE WOULD BE

00:27:03.555 --> 00:27:06.458
APPROPRIATE- BUT- THESE TYPES

00:27:06.524 --> 00:27:07.492
OF BUSINESS CAN ALREADY

00:27:07.559 --> 00:27:07.959
INCORPORATE AS A C.

00:27:08.026 --> 00:27:11.162
CORPORATION- I WAS NOT AWARE

00:27:11.229 --> 00:27:11.763
THAT THERE ARE INSURANCE

00:27:11.830 --> 00:27:14.799
REQUIREMENTS FOR SEEK. FOR A IS

00:27:14.866 --> 00:27:15.600
SIMILAR CONSTITUTED SEE

00:27:15.667 --> 00:27:18.336
CORPORATIONS THAT- SO THAT

00:27:18.403 --> 00:27:19.504
COMPANIES THAT WE TALKED TO

00:27:19.571 --> 00:27:20.605
KERRY VOLUNTARY YOU KNOW

00:27:20.672 --> 00:27:22.774
INSURANCE. AND OTHER CURRENTLY

00:27:22.841 --> 00:27:24.576
SEE CORPSE WHO CARRY THAT

00:27:24.642 --> 00:27:26.611
INSURANCE AND THE COMPANIES

00:27:26.678 --> 00:27:27.645
THAT WE TALKED TO THAT AREN'T

00:27:27.712 --> 00:27:29.981
LARGE COMPANIES THERE- THERE.

00:27:30.048 --> 00:27:31.316
WAS AN ELEVEN PERSON BROKERAGE

00:27:31.383 --> 00:27:33.718
FIRM. IS VOLUNTARILY CARRYING

00:27:33.785 --> 00:27:35.987
RIGHT NOW IS THE C. CORP- AND

00:27:36.054 --> 00:27:36.721
AMOUNT OF INSURANCE THAT

00:27:36.788 --> 00:27:39.090
BASICALLY DOUBLES THE MINIMUMS-

00:27:39.157 --> 00:27:40.725
OF WHAT WOULD BE REQUIRED UNDER

00:27:40.792 --> 00:27:42.727
THIS BILL. OKAY SO THAT THIS IS

00:27:42.794 --> 00:27:43.695
GETTING TO THE HEART OF MY

00:27:43.762 --> 00:27:45.530
SKEPTICISM HERE SO WE ALREADY

00:27:45.597 --> 00:27:46.765
ALLOW THESE TYPES OF

00:27:46.831 --> 00:27:48.833
BUSINESSES. TO INCORPORATE AS A

00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:50.835
C. CORPORATION AND WE DO NOT

00:27:50.902 --> 00:27:52.370
REQUIRE THEM TO CARRY INSURANCE

00:27:52.437 --> 00:27:53.738
DESPITE THE FACT THAT THERE'S A

00:27:53.805 --> 00:27:55.306
LIABILITY SHIELD STOLE WHY

00:27:55.373 --> 00:27:57.842
THEN. IF WE'RE ADDING L. L.

00:27:57.909 --> 00:28:00.278
C.'S TO THE MIX OF ENTITIES

00:28:00.345 --> 00:28:02.847
THAT CAN FORM THIS BUSINESS

00:28:02.914 --> 00:28:03.415
WHAT WE REQUIRE INSURANCE OF

00:28:03.481 --> 00:28:05.417
THEM. AGAIN IT'S IMPORTANT TO

00:28:05.483 --> 00:28:06.451
POINT OUT THAT THIS IS AN EARLY

00:28:06.518 --> 00:28:09.220
OPTIONAL AS WELL. SO IT MAY BE

00:28:09.287 --> 00:28:10.755
BECAUSE OF THAT BURDEN THE

00:28:10.822 --> 00:28:11.289
COMPANIES DON'T MAKE THAT

00:28:11.356 --> 00:28:15.927
CHOICE. BUT THE ASSOCIATION HAS

00:28:15.994 --> 00:28:18.563
ASKED TO CREATE THIS MECHANISM

00:28:18.630 --> 00:28:21.132
STRICTLY AS AN OPTION. FOR

00:28:21.199 --> 00:28:27.305
BROKERS AND WE- ON THAT PREMISE

00:28:27.372 --> 00:28:27.839
OF BASED AND THE SMELL THE

00:28:27.906 --> 00:28:30.742
STAFF WANTED TO. WANTED TO WERE

00:28:30.809 --> 00:28:31.509
INCREASED INSURANCE

00:28:31.576 --> 00:28:34.412
REQUIREMENT. BUT IT AGAIN IT'S

00:28:34.479 --> 00:28:36.381
OPTIONAL SO BUT BUT SURE AS THE

00:28:36.448 --> 00:28:38.917
AUTHOR I'M NOT GONNA. DETER TOO

00:28:38.983 --> 00:28:40.418
MUCH I GUESS WE'LL SEE I MEAN

00:28:40.485 --> 00:28:41.619
IF THE BILL BECOMES LAW WE'LL

00:28:41.686 --> 00:28:43.321
SEE IF COMPANIES MAKE THIS

00:28:43.388 --> 00:28:45.990
CHOICE I DON'T MEAN TO. TO

00:28:46.057 --> 00:28:49.627
DISMISS YOUR CONCERN- AND I'M

00:28:49.694 --> 00:28:55.066
NOT DISMISSING IT. BUT IT M. IT

00:28:55.133 --> 00:28:57.235
IS WHAT IT IS IN THAT SENSE IF

00:28:57.302 --> 00:28:58.736
YOU KNOW WE WILL LEARN IF

00:28:58.803 --> 00:29:00.338
COMPANIES ONE COMPANY

00:29:00.405 --> 00:29:03.041
SCRUTINIZE THIS OPTION IT MAKES

00:29:03.108 --> 00:29:04.876
SENSE FOR THEM OR NOT BUT

00:29:04.943 --> 00:29:06.311
THERE'S NOTHING MANDATORY ABOUT

00:29:06.377 --> 00:29:08.179
CHOOSING THAT OPTION SURE I

ABOUT THE FACT THAT THIS

00:29:17.856 --> 00:29:18.756
INSURANCE REQUIREMENT HAS BEEN

00:29:18.823 --> 00:29:20.358
ADDED TO THE LAST MINUTE AND IT

PARENTHOOD AND UNDERSTAND THAT

00:47:53.737 --> 00:47:54.238
ABORTION CARE IS HEALTHCARE.

00:47:54.304 --> 00:47:54.771

00:47:54.838 --> 00:47:56.840
RIGHT. AND WE THINK THE

00:47:56.907 --> 00:47:57.674
CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE FOR

00:47:57.741 --> 00:47:59.576

00:48:19.329 --> 00:48:35.479
OPPOSITION

00:48:42.552 --> 00:48:43.220
. PLEASE CHAIR

00:48:43.287 --> 00:48:44.955
REMEMBERS MY NAME IS GREG BIRCH

00:48:45.022 --> 00:48:46.056
WITH THE CALIFORNIA FAMILY

00:48:46.123 --> 00:48:48.558
COUNCIL. I'M SURE YOU REALIZE

00:48:48.625 --> 00:48:49.793
WITH THE RECENT CHANGES IN THE

00:48:49.860 --> 00:48:51.428
SUPREME COURT THAT ROE VERSUS

00:48:51.495 --> 00:48:52.896
WADE DECISION IS ON LIFE

00:48:52.963 --> 00:48:55.232
SUPPORT. BUT I ALSO BELIEVE

00:48:55.299 --> 00:48:57.000
PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR ABORTION IS

00:48:57.067 --> 00:48:58.435
IN A PREPARE PRECARIOUS

00:48:58.502 --> 00:49:00.971
SITUATION BECAUSE THE MORAL

00:49:01.038 --> 00:49:01.938
REASONING USED TO JUSTIFY IT IS

00:49:02.005 --> 00:49:04.508
BEING EXPOSED. ABORTION IS ONLY

00:49:04.574 --> 00:49:05.842
SURVIVED THIS LONG BECAUSE

00:49:05.909 --> 00:49:08.879
PROPONENTS WERE ABLE TO DECEIVE

00:49:08.945 --> 00:49:09.946
PEOPLE ABOUT THE BRUTAL REALITY

00:49:10.013 --> 00:49:12.883
OF THE PRACTICE JUST LISTEN TO

00:49:12.949 --> 00:49:14.751
THE WAY ABORTION RIGHTS

00:49:14.818 --> 00:49:16.153
ADVOCATES TALK ABOUT THE

00:49:16.219 --> 00:49:17.287
PROCEDURE. DO YOU HEAR THE

00:49:17.354 --> 00:49:18.622
LANGUAGE OF NASTY EXCUSE TO

00:49:18.689 --> 00:49:20.390
DISTRACT PEOPLE AWAY FROM

00:49:20.457 --> 00:49:21.992
THINKING ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS

00:49:22.059 --> 00:49:23.794
DURING AN ABORTION WHY DID THEY

00:49:23.860 --> 00:49:25.762
DO THAT WHY CAN'T THEY TALK

00:49:25.829 --> 00:49:27.731
ABOUT ABORTION IN PLAIN

00:49:27.798 --> 00:49:29.466
EXACTING LANGUAGE. I THINK YOU

00:49:29.533 --> 00:49:31.735
KNOW THE ANSWER. YET

00:49:31.802 --> 00:49:33.070
DISTRACTING PEOPLE FROM OR AT

00:49:33.136 --> 00:49:34.371
THE REALITY OF ABORTION HAS

00:49:34.438 --> 00:49:36.940
BECOME NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE WITH

00:49:37.007 --> 00:49:38.275
ADVANCES IN ULTRASOUND

00:49:38.342 --> 00:49:40.777
TECHNOLOGY. I HAVE THREE KIDS

00:49:40.844 --> 00:49:43.180
AND I REMEMBER BEING INTRODUCED

00:49:43.246 --> 00:49:44.047
TO MY CHILDREN THROUGH AN

00:49:44.114 --> 00:49:46.183
ULTRASOUND MACHINE. I SAW MY

00:49:46.249 --> 00:49:48.552
DAUGHTER'S HEART BEATING AND MY

00:49:48.618 --> 00:49:50.721
SON'S ARMS AND LEGS IN MOTION

00:49:50.787 --> 00:49:52.155
JUST A FEW MONTHS AFTER

00:49:52.222 --> 00:49:54.424
CONCEPTION. AND IT WAS AN

00:49:54.491 --> 00:49:55.092
INCREDIBLE UNBELIEVABLE

00:49:55.158 --> 00:49:57.694
EXPERIENCE FOR A NEW FATHER. SO

00:49:57.761 --> 00:49:58.829
WHEN I THINK ABOUT WHAT

00:49:58.895 --> 00:50:01.064
ABORTION REALLY IS I RECALL

00:50:01.131 --> 00:50:02.699
THOSE FLICKERING ULTRASOUND

00:50:02.766 --> 00:50:05.369

REVEALING EXPERIENCE WITH THE

00:50:23.920 --> 00:50:25.622
ULTRASOUND MACHINE IS REPEATED

00:50:25.689 --> 00:50:28.959

THAT THIS WILL POTENTIALLY

01:10:57.653 --> 01:10:58.787
CREATE A CHILLING EFFECT ON THE

MOST OF THESE DOLLARS WORKS-

BECAUSE OF THEIR DESIRE NOT TO

SEEK RECOGNITION- BUT OF THIS

01:11:12.101 --> 01:11:15.270
IDEA TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE

01:11:15.337 --> 01:11:15.838
NONPROFIT COMMUNITY AND THE

01:11:15.904 --> 01:11:16.438

HAVE. OUR MISSION IS A

01:11:18.307 --> 01:11:19.608

01:11:24.913 --> 01:11:26.849
WE MAIN ACTS WE MAINTAIN THE

01:11:26.915 --> 01:11:28.651
HIGHEST DEGREE OF TRANSPARENCY

ONE FOR CALIFORNIANS TO USE-

01:12:17.499 --> 01:12:20.302

MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND

01:12:26.341 --> 01:12:27.042
MEMBERS MY NAME IS NICOLE

01:12:27.109 --> 01:12:28.477
TAYLOR AND I HAVE THE PRIVILEGE

01:12:28.544 --> 01:12:29.678
OF LEADING THE SILICON VALLEY

01:12:29.745 --> 01:12:31.346
COMMUNITY FOUNDATION AND I ECHO

01:12:31.413 --> 01:12:32.614
THE APPRECIATION FOR THE

01:12:32.681 --> 01:12:34.483
AUTHOR. AND FOR THE COMEDIAN

01:12:34.550 --> 01:12:36.485
HEARING OUR CONCERNS. WE SHARE

01:12:36.552 --> 01:12:38.454
WITH YOU AND THE AUTHOR THE

01:12:38.520 --> 01:12:40.122
GOAL OF ENSURING THE HIGHEST

01:12:40.189 --> 01:12:41.190
PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS FOR THE

01:12:41.256 --> 01:12:42.725
PHILANTHROPIC COMMUNITY.

01:12:42.791 --> 01:12:46.061
HOWEVER REMAIN OPPOSED TO AB

01:12:46.128 --> 01:12:46.562
SEVENTEEN TWELVE FOR TWO

01:12:46.628 --> 01:12:48.597
FUNDAMENTAL REASONS. ONE IS A

01:12:48.664 --> 01:12:50.099
SIGNIFICANT CONCERN RESULTING

01:12:50.165 --> 01:12:52.201
FROM THE BILL'S FUND BY FUND

01:12:52.267 --> 01:12:53.902
REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. OUR

01:12:53.969 --> 01:12:55.604
EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE WORKING

01:12:55.671 --> 01:12:57.239
WITH TENS OF THOUSANDS OF

01:12:57.306 --> 01:12:58.707
GENEROUS DONORS ACROSS THE

01:12:58.774 --> 01:13:00.776
STATE. CONVINCE US THAT THESE

01:13:00.843 --> 01:13:02.478
NEW REQUIREMENTS WOULD DAMAGE

01:13:02.544 --> 01:13:04.680
THE TRUST THEY PLACED IN US.

01:13:04.747 --> 01:13:06.248
WELL WE APPRECIATE THAT THE

01:13:06.315 --> 01:13:07.316
AUTHORS TAKEN THE STEPS TO

01:13:07.382 --> 01:13:08.817
MITIGATE THE RISK THEY ARE NOT

01:13:08.884 --> 01:13:10.452
SUFFICIENT TO FULLY PROTECT OUR

01:13:10.519 --> 01:13:12.921
PRIVACY. THE BILL'S REPORTING

01:13:12.988 --> 01:13:14.656
REQUIREMENTS CAN EASILY ALLOW

01:13:14.723 --> 01:13:15.858
SOMEONE IN THE PUBLIC SPHERE TO

01:13:15.924 --> 01:13:17.993
FIGURE OUT WHO THE DONOR IS AND

01:13:18.060 --> 01:13:19.561
WHAT ORGANIZATIONS THEY WANT TO

01:13:19.628 --> 01:13:21.797
GIVE. SO THE QUESTION IS WHY

01:13:21.864 --> 01:13:23.632
CAN'T ALL CALIFORNIANS HAVE

01:13:23.699 --> 01:13:24.266
THEIR PRIVACY PROTECTED IN THIS

01:13:24.333 --> 01:13:27.803
WAY. IN SHORT ORDER WE BELIEVE

01:13:27.870 --> 01:13:30.038
THAT THIS IS GOING TO HAVE A

01:13:30.105 --> 01:13:31.440
CHILLING EFFECT OF CHARITABLE

01:13:31.507 --> 01:13:34.176
GIVING THROUGHOUT OUR STATE.

01:13:34.243 --> 01:13:37.346
THE SECOND CONCERN IS THAT AB

01:13:37.412 --> 01:13:37.846
SEVENTEEN TWELVE REMAINS

01:13:37.913 --> 01:13:39.281
DISTURBINGLY VAGUE IN THE

01:13:39.348 --> 01:13:41.350
PROBLEM IT SEEKS TO ADDRESS IN

01:13:41.416 --> 01:13:42.651
ITS CURRENT FORM THE BILL PIC

01:13:42.718 --> 01:13:44.920
CODIFIES IS SUSPICIOUS AN ODDLY

01:13:44.987 --> 01:13:46.321
DARK VIEW OF THE PERSONAL

01:13:46.388 --> 01:13:48.157
GENEROSITY. THAT RESULTS IN

01:13:48.223 --> 01:13:49.491
SEVERAL BILLION DOLLARS OF

01:13:49.558 --> 01:13:51.393
ANNUAL SUPPORT TO CALIFORNIA

01:13:51.460 --> 01:13:52.828
FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES IN

01:13:52.895 --> 01:13:55.430
NEED. IN OUR VIEW THE PROPOSED

01:13:55.497 --> 01:13:56.799
SWEEPING INCREASING RECORDING

01:13:56.865 --> 01:13:58.867
REPORTING. AS WELL AS THE

01:13:58.934 --> 01:14:00.269
UNDEFINED REQUESTS DIRECTED TO

01:14:00.335 --> 01:14:01.637
THE ATTORNEY GENERAL REVEAL

01:14:01.703 --> 01:14:03.839
THAT A. B. AB SEVENTEEN TWELVE

01:14:03.906 --> 01:14:04.273
IS NEITHER PRUDENTLY

01:14:04.339 --> 01:14:05.974
PROPORTIONAL NOT WORTHY OF ITS

01:14:06.041 --> 01:14:08.110
RISK. MY OLLEAGUES AT THE

01:14:08.177 --> 01:14:09.311

THE AUTHOR TO FIND REASONABLE

01:14:14.449 --> 01:14:16.518
REASONABLE ADAPTATIONS THAT

01:14:16.585 --> 01:14:18.287
WILL ENHANCE GIVING VEHICLE

01:14:18.353 --> 01:14:19.254
THAT IS AND HAS BEEN

01:14:19.321 --> 01:14:21.356
DEMONSTRABLY SUCCESSFUL IN

01:14:21.423 --> 01:14:23.492
ENCOURAGING AND FACILITATING

01:14:23.559 --> 01:14:24.092

GOING ON IN THIS INDUSTRY- IT

01:16:59.514 --> 01:17:00.615
THE BILL ALLOWS THE ATTORNEY

01:17:00.682 --> 01:17:02.851
GENERAL TO ASK A SERIES OF

01:17:02.918 --> 01:17:03.885

I'LL TELL YOU MY CONCERN WITH

ASKING THOSE QUESTIONS THAT

01:17:10.258 --> 01:17:11.193

INFORMATION THAT IT DEEMS

01:17:14.696 --> 01:17:16.231

PROPERLY ADMINISTERED. AND THAT

01:17:19.468 --> 01:17:22.871
IS NOT A- INFORMATION THAT WE

01:17:22.938 --> 01:17:24.539

01:17:24.606 --> 01:17:26.475
INVESTMENT TO DISCLOSE OUR

01:17:26.541 --> 01:17:27.676
MOMENT OR IF YOU TALK A LITTLE

01:17:27.743 --> 01:17:28.310
BIT ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE THINKING

01:17:28.377 --> 01:17:29.111
WAS BECAUSE I'M REALLY

01:17:29.177 --> 01:17:30.779
STRUGGLING WITH THAT. BECAUSE

IF THAT WERE NOT IN THE BILL I

01:17:32.948 --> 01:17:34.016
GOT SOME CONCERNS ABOUT ABOUT

01:17:35.250 --> 01:17:36.852
BIT OF AN ASIDE FROM THOSE OF

I'M SUPPORTIVEOF WHAT YOU'RE

DOING BUT I MEAN IT IT REALLY

01:17:40.355 --> 01:17:42.858
SEEMS LIKE AN OVER REACH THE

01:17:42.924 --> 01:17:43.358
WAY THE BILL AS WRITTEN.

01:17:43.425 --> 01:17:45.527

ASSEMBLYMEMBER OUT WE'VE

01:17:46.361 --> 01:17:46.895

WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S

01:17:47.929 --> 01:17:49.698
OFFICE ON THIS BILL. IT'S CLEAR

01:17:49.765 --> 01:17:52.100
THAT- WE CAN'T SPECIFY IN THE

01:17:52.167 --> 01:17:54.102
BILL EXACTLY ALL THE DETAILS

01:17:54.169 --> 01:17:55.604

01:17:56.772 --> 01:17:58.874
ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE. THIS

01:17:58.940 --> 01:18:00.609
IS TYPICAL LANGUAGE WHERE THEY

01:18:00.675 --> 01:18:02.144
WILL KEEP TO THE IDEAS THAT ARE

01:18:02.210 --> 01:18:03.779
PRESENTED HERE. BUT IT GIVES

01:18:03.845 --> 01:18:05.213
SOME THE LET THE LEVERAGE TO BE

01:18:05.280 --> 01:18:07.482
ABLE TO ASK THAT KIND JUST TO

01:18:07.549 --> 01:18:10.552
FLESH IT OUT. TO A LARGE DEGREE.

01:18:10.619 --> 01:18:11.653
OKAY I UNDERSTAND BUT I MEAN

01:18:11.720 --> 01:18:12.888

PRIVACY IN INDUSTRY ON ONE SIDE

01:18:18.794 --> 01:18:19.528
AND THE NEEDS OF PUBLIC

01:18:19.594 --> 01:18:20.562
INTEREST ON THE OTHER AND I'M

01:18:20.629 --> 01:18:21.830
AFRAID IF WE JUST GOING TO.

01:18:21.897 --> 01:18:23.498
GIVE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL FREE

01:18:23.565 --> 01:18:24.699
RANGE THE MAN WHATEVER

01:18:24.766 --> 01:18:25.667
INFORMATION THAT THEY WANT FROM

01:18:25.734 --> 01:18:27.135
THIS AND THREE. THAT THAT'S AN

01:18:27.202 --> 01:18:28.270
OVER REACH AND THAT'S WHAT'S

01:18:28.336 --> 01:18:28.804
GOING TO PREVENT ME FROM

01:18:28.870 --> 01:18:31.006
SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY. I

01:18:31.073 --> 01:18:32.207
UNDERSTAND THAT I THINK I HAVE

01:18:32.274 --> 01:18:33.642
A LOT OF CONFIDENCE IN THE

01:18:33.708 --> 01:18:34.643
TOURNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE IN

01:18:34.709 --> 01:18:35.644

01:18:35.710 --> 01:18:37.179
PARTICULAR ADMINISTRATION TO BE

01:18:37.245 --> 01:18:40.649

THEY'VE CRAFT LEGISLATION.

01:18:41.716 --> 01:18:43.518
HELLO GOOD AND JUST TO ADD ON

01:18:43.585 --> 01:18:47.689
THE PRIVACY FRONT I MEAN WE-HEARD HEARD LOUD AND CLEAR ON

01:18:47.756 --> 01:18:49.257
JEOPARDIZE ANYONE'S- PRIVACY ON

01:18:49.324 --> 01:18:50.625
THIS AND SO I THINK. WHAT WE

01:18:50.692 --> 01:18:51.960
PUT FORTH IT'S A GOOD

01:18:52.027 --> 01:18:53.261
COMPROMISE IT'S I THINK FOR

01:18:53.328 --> 01:18:54.930
SERVE STANDARD PROTOCOL. TO

OUR PRIVACY NO NAME SUBMITTED

01:18:57.399 --> 01:18:58.667
NO ADDRESS NO CONTACT

01:18:58.733 --> 01:18:59.267
INFORMATION OF PHONE NUMBERS

AND EMAIL ADDRESSES- REALLY

01:19:02.404 --> 01:19:05.107
JUST SORT OF AN ACCOUNT NUMBER.

01:19:05.173 --> 01:19:05.707
SO WE CAN SEE WHAT WE WANT TO

01:19:05.774 --> 01:19:08.009
KNOW IS. YOU KNOW. THE MONEY

01:19:08.076 --> 01:19:08.610
WENT INTO DEATH DID IT GO OUT

01:19:08.677 --> 01:19:10.545
RIGHT- AND I THINK. I THINK AS

01:19:10.612 --> 01:19:12.114
AS YOU THE OPPOSITION SAID TO I

01:19:12.180 --> 01:19:13.548
THINK THEY ALSO WANT TO ENSURE

01:19:13.615 --> 01:19:14.950
THAT. THEIR MONEY IS MAKING IT

01:19:15.016 --> 01:19:16.017
OUT TO THE COMMUNITY WE JUST

01:19:16.084 --> 01:19:17.119
DON'T HAVE THE INSIDE RIGHT

01:19:17.185 --> 01:19:18.720
NOW. OR THE SUNLIGHT ON IF THAT

01:19:18.787 --> 01:19:20.422
IS ACTUALLY HAPPENING WHEN

01:19:20.489 --> 01:19:21.823
THERE'S AGGREGATED DATA THAT'S

01:19:21.890 --> 01:19:23.925
WHY THE INDIVIDUAL. INFORMATION

01:19:23.992 --> 01:19:28.196
IS CRITICAL SURE BUT- I THINK

01:19:28.263 --> 01:19:28.830
WE'RE ON THE SAME PAGE ABOUT. I

01:19:28.897 --> 01:19:30.232
HAVE SOME CONCERNS OF PRIVACY

01:19:30.298 --> 01:19:30.765
AS WELL. HAPPY THAT YOU'RE

01:19:30.832 --> 01:19:31.366
GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON

01:19:31.433 --> 01:19:33.235
IT. I THINK THAT THE ARGUMENT

01:19:33.301 --> 01:19:34.302
IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS WAS

01:19:34.369 --> 01:19:36.505
REALLY FASCINATING ABOUT. THE

01:19:36.571 --> 01:19:38.540
WAYS IN WHICH JUST DISCLOSURE

01:19:38.607 --> 01:19:40.542
OF WHAT THE ASSETS WERE. COULD

01:19:40.609 --> 01:19:43.145
REVEAL THE IDENTITY OF SOME OF

01:19:43.211 --> 01:19:45.547
THE DONORS JUST BECAUSE OF YOU

01:19:45.614 --> 01:19:46.181
KNOW THE UNIQUE NATURE OF THE

01:19:46.248 --> 01:19:47.916
ASSETS THAT ARE IN THE DEATH.

01:19:47.983 --> 01:19:48.950
SO I'M HOPEFUL THAT YOU CAN

01:19:49.017 --> 01:19:49.651
CONTINUE TO WORK ON THAT BUT

01:19:49.718 --> 01:19:51.419
I'D LIKE TO ASK YOU. A I'LL BE

01:19:51.486 --> 01:19:52.787

01:19:57.859 --> 01:19:59.561
THIS BILL INTO A- FORM OF.

01:19:59.628 --> 01:20:00.795
SOMETHING THAT THAT I AND OTHER

01:20:00.862 --> 01:20:03.398

01:20:03.465 --> 01:20:04.599
IF YOU WOULD LOOK AT MAYBE

SOLUTION FOR THE PROBLEM- THE

01:20:58.119 --> 01:20:59.821
PROBLEM IS HERE I THINK WE CAN

01:20:59.888 --> 01:21:02.457
AGREE THAT THERE'S A PROBLEM-

01:21:02.524 --> 01:21:04.025
I'M NOT SURE IF THE SOLUTION

01:21:04.092 --> 01:21:05.126

HERE AND HOW IT IS THAT THESE

01:22:49.230 --> 01:22:50.532
ARE OR WHAT FOR WHAT PURPOSE

01:22:50.598 --> 01:22:52.434
ARE IN WHAT IMPROPER PURPOSE

01:22:52.500 --> 01:22:53.968
THESE- ARE BEING USED I HEARD

01:22:54.035 --> 01:22:56.371
SOME MENTION OF- POSSIBLE A

01:22:56.438 --> 01:22:57.605
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE FOR

01:22:57.672 --> 01:22:59.808
PROFIT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS-

01:22:59.874 --> 01:23:01.576
SO WHAT EXACTLY YOU THINK IT IS

01:23:01.643 --> 01:23:03.945
THAT WE BE TRYING TO UNCOVER

01:23:04.012 --> 01:23:05.980
SURE SO I THINK AND I L. MY

01:23:06.047 --> 01:23:08.383
WITNESSES CAN. TALK AS WELL BUT

01:23:08.450 --> 01:23:10.018
THERE BEEN NUMEROUS MEDIA

01:23:10.085 --> 01:23:12.087
ACCOUNTS- OVER THE LAST YEAR

01:23:12.153 --> 01:23:14.823
PLUS- AROUND MONEY GOING INTO

01:23:14.889 --> 01:23:16.257
DAFT'S BUT THEN POTENTIALLY NOT

01:23:16.324 --> 01:23:17.392
MAKE IT OUT TO THE COMMUNITY

01:23:17.459 --> 01:23:20.428
AND SO IS SOMEONE AS WE ALL OUR

01:23:20.495 --> 01:23:21.196
STUDENTS OF PUBLIC DOLLARS

RIGHT WE MADE THE TO THOSE

01:23:24.366 --> 01:23:26.701
FOLKS READING AT A TAX WRITE

01:23:26.768 --> 01:23:28.203
OFF SO THAT MONEY CAN GET INTO

01:23:28.269 --> 01:23:31.740
THE COMMUNITY. AT ITS SOBRE.

01:23:31.806 --> 01:23:35.543
COMING OUR PUBLIC FUNDS. BUT IT.

01:23:35.610 --> 01:23:37.112
YEAH JUST ANSWER THE QUESTION-

01:23:37.178 --> 01:23:37.779
THERE'S SERVE ANECDOTAL

01:23:37.846 --> 01:23:39.147
INFORMATION THAT WE READ ABOUT

01:23:39.214 --> 01:23:39.781
AND I'M BUT YOU GUYS CAN SHARE

01:23:39.848 --> 01:23:40.382
SOME OF THAT IF YOU WANT- SO

01:23:40.448 --> 01:23:40.849
IT'S WE'RE TRYING TO

01:23:40.915 --> 01:23:42.784
UNDERSTAND. THIS IS A VERY

01:23:42.851 --> 01:23:43.985
UNREGULATED STAFFS ARE ARE

01:23:44.052 --> 01:23:44.619
BASICALLY UNREGULATED.

01:23:44.686 --> 01:23:45.553
FOUNDATION BOTTOM RIGHT THEY

01:23:45.620 --> 01:23:46.421
HAVE A PAY OUT THAT THEY HAVE

01:23:46.488 --> 01:23:49.224
TO- PUSH OUT. OF DEATH DON'T

01:23:49.290 --> 01:23:50.859
HAVE THOSE OF SAME EXPECTATIONS

01:23:50.925 --> 01:23:52.660
AND SO. AS THIS IS A GROWING

01:23:52.727 --> 01:23:54.896
PART OF THE PHILANTHROPIC

01:23:54.963 --> 01:23:55.630
MONIES THAT IS IT'S MONEY

01:23:55.697 --> 01:23:56.931
THAT'S COMING OUT OF OUR TAX

01:23:56.998 --> 01:23:59.501
BASE. MORE INSIGHT AND

01:23:59.567 --> 01:24:02.837
TRANSPARENCY TO IF THAT MONEY

01:24:02.904 --> 01:24:03.371
IS REALLY GETTING AND THE

01:24:03.438 --> 01:24:03.972
COMMUNITY IS THE POINT OF THE

01:24:04.038 --> 01:24:05.240
BILL. BUT WHAT'S THE REASON WHY

01:24:05.306 --> 01:24:05.807
THEY MAY NOT BE GOOD PUTTING

01:24:05.874 --> 01:24:06.441
THE MONEY. THE DORMANT ACCOUNTS

01:24:06.508 --> 01:24:10.111
I MEAN I DON'T KNOW IF. WELL

01:24:10.178 --> 01:24:11.579
WHAT WE CAN TELL YOU IS WHAT

01:24:11.646 --> 01:24:13.214
THE PRESS IS TOSSING ABOUT FOR

01:24:13.281 --> 01:24:14.983
EXAMPLE THE NEW YORK TIMES THE

01:24:15.049 --> 01:24:17.252
LA TIMES FORBES OF BLOOMBERG

01:24:17.318 --> 01:24:18.720
AND MANY OTHER PRESS HAVE

01:24:18.787 --> 01:24:20.789
REPORTED ON A NUMBER OF THINGS

01:24:20.855 --> 01:24:21.923
ONE IS. THE USE OF DONOR

01:24:21.990 --> 01:24:24.025
ADVISED FUNDS WERE FOUND DAIS

01:24:24.092 --> 01:24:26.027
PRIVATE FOUNDATIONS MOVING

01:24:26.094 --> 01:24:27.061
THEIR MONEY INTO A DONOR

01:24:27.128 --> 01:24:28.163
ADVISED FUNDS THAT THEY

01:24:28.229 --> 01:24:30.265
CONTROL- SO TO MEET THE PAYOUT

01:24:30.331 --> 01:24:31.266
REQUIREMENT WITHOUT ACTUALLY

01:24:31.332 --> 01:24:33.835
GIVING ANY MONEY OUT. ANOTHER

01:24:33.902 --> 01:24:35.236
ONE THE NEW YORK TIMES AS TECH

01:24:35.303 --> 01:24:37.138
BILLIONAIRES HACKED OF TAXES

01:24:37.205 --> 01:24:38.773
WITH THE PHILANTHROPIC LOOPHOLE

01:24:38.840 --> 01:24:41.075
IS THE USE OF LARA BECAUSE

01:24:41.142 --> 01:24:42.544
LARGE DONORS LARGE DONOR

01:24:42.610 --> 01:24:44.579
ADVISED FUNDS VERY OFTEN. THE

01:24:44.646 --> 01:24:46.147
DONORS NOT ONLY CONTROL WHAT

01:24:46.214 --> 01:24:47.282
THAT THE MONEY GOES OUT OR NOT

01:24:47.348 --> 01:24:48.616
BUT THEY ALSO CONTROL ALL THE

01:24:48.683 --> 01:24:53.188
MONEY IS INVESTED. AND SO THEIR

01:24:53.254 --> 01:24:55.089
USE THE MOVING THOSE

01:24:55.156 --> 01:24:55.657
INVESTMENTS AROUND. I AND IS

01:24:55.723 --> 01:24:58.059
THAT. THAT THE PRESS HAS

01:24:58.126 --> 01:24:59.194
REPORTED ARE FOR PERSONAL GAIN

01:24:59.260 --> 01:25:00.462
TO SUPPORT COMPANIES IN WHICH

01:25:00.528 --> 01:25:01.796
THEY ARE OTHERWISE INVESTED

01:25:01.863 --> 01:25:03.064
WERE TO MANIPULATE STOCK

01:25:03.131 --> 01:25:05.333
PRICES. SO AGAIN WE THINK THAT

01:25:05.400 --> 01:25:06.367
THESE ARE ANECDOTAL AND

01:25:06.434 --> 01:25:08.570
EVIDENCE IT'S BEEN. BROUGHT UP

01:25:08.636 --> 01:25:10.238
BY MANY MANY PEOPLE IN THE

01:25:10.305 --> 01:25:11.773
PRESS AND THAT'S IS WHAT ONE OF

01:25:11.840 --> 01:25:13.441
THE REASONS I THINK WHY WE'RE

01:25:13.508 --> 01:25:15.510
STARTING WITH TRANSPARENCY.

01:25:15.577 --> 01:25:16.110
RATHER THAN BRING IN SOMETHING

01:25:16.177 --> 01:25:20.615
ELSE. REMEMBER ACT LIKE THE

01:25:20.682 --> 01:25:21.783
AUTHOR OF TWO REASONS IN MY

01:25:21.850 --> 01:25:23.852
EXPERIENCE OF. OF ALMOST

01:25:23.918 --> 01:25:25.553
EIGHTEEN YEARS NOW AT THE- IN

01:25:25.620 --> 01:25:29.057
THE COMMUNICATION FEEL- WE HAVE

01:25:29.123 --> 01:25:31.793
A DOLLARS WHO COME TO US- WHO

01:25:31.860 --> 01:25:34.195
WERE SORT OF MODERATE-

01:25:34.262 --> 01:25:35.897
CALIFORNIANS INTENSIVE THEIR

01:25:35.964 --> 01:25:38.266
FINANCIAL. STATUS WHO WANT TO

01:25:38.333 --> 01:25:39.868
ESTABLISH A DONOR ADVISED FUND

01:25:39.934 --> 01:25:41.703
BECAUSE THEY WANT TO GET BACK

01:25:41.769 --> 01:25:43.471
TO THE COMMUNITY- BUT THEY

01:25:43.538 --> 01:25:45.507
DON'T YET KNOW WHAT ISSUES THEY

01:25:45.573 --> 01:25:49.444
WANT TO ACTUALLY FOCUS ON. AND

01:25:49.511 --> 01:25:51.145
SO THEY WANT TIME- IN TERMS OF

01:25:51.212 --> 01:25:52.914
A STEP IN THE FIGHT AND THEN

01:25:52.981 --> 01:25:55.750
HAVING TIME ACSI TO EXPLORE THE

01:25:55.817 --> 01:25:57.418
ISSUES THAT ARE MOST IMPORTANT

01:25:57.485 --> 01:25:58.520
TO THEM THIS IS THE MOST

01:25:58.586 --> 01:26:00.188
IMPORTANT TO THE COMMUNITY- SO

01:26:00.255 --> 01:26:01.823
IT SOMETIMES DOES TAKE THEM

01:26:01.890 --> 01:26:04.692
TIME TO DECIDE- THE KINDS OF

01:26:04.759 --> 01:26:06.761
ORGANIZATIONS AND THE KINDS OF.

01:26:06.828 --> 01:26:08.229
IT IS AN EFFORT THEY WANT TO

01:26:08.296 --> 01:26:09.697
THEY WANT TO CONTRIBUTE TO IT

01:26:09.764 --> 01:26:12.667
SO THAT'S ONE THE SECOND IS

01:26:12.734 --> 01:26:16.037
THAT BECAUSE WE HAVE A SMALL

01:26:16.104 --> 01:26:17.472
VESSEL FOR DON INVITE FUNDS BUT

01:26:17.539 --> 01:26:19.140
YOU CAN PUT IT ON THE VICE FUND

01:26:19.207 --> 01:26:20.775
AT THE SECOND FOUNDATION. FOR

01:26:20.842 --> 01:26:22.343
TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A MANY I'M

01:26:22.410 --> 01:26:25.280
THEY WANT TO BUILD. SO THAT

01:26:25.346 --> 01:26:27.549
THEY CAN HAVE THE MAXIMUM

01:26:27.615 --> 01:26:31.019
IMPACT IN THE KEY THEY WANT TO

01:26:31.085 --> 01:26:33.254
HAVE SO THAT MADE ME WANT TO

01:26:33.321 --> 01:26:34.589
TAKE SOME TIME AT THE TO ADD TO

01:26:34.656 --> 01:26:38.960
THAT AND OVER. TIME IN ORDER TO

01:26:39.027 --> 01:26:42.263
BE ABLE TO MAXIMIZE IN THE END.

01:26:42.330 --> 01:26:45.867
AND TRYING TO TRANSIT. HOUSE

01:26:45.934 --> 01:26:46.601
WHEN I SAY THAT WE ARE ACTUALLY

01:26:46.668 --> 01:26:47.335
HIGHLY RATHER REGULATED WE

01:26:47.402 --> 01:26:47.802
REPORT QUITE A BIT OF

01:26:47.869 --> 01:26:48.870
INFORMATION ON OUR NINE

01:26:48.937 --> 01:26:49.504
NINETIES WE HAVE TO REPOT ON

01:26:49.571 --> 01:26:50.104
IRAQ'S ATTORNEY GENERAL THAN

01:26:50.171 --> 01:26:51.072
THE CALIFORNIA NONPROFIT

01:26:51.139 --> 01:26:52.507
INTEGRITY ACT ACTUALLY PREVENTS

01:26:52.574 --> 01:26:55.076
ANY SELF DEALING WE HAVE- QUITE

01:26:55.143 --> 01:26:56.277
A BIT OF REGULATIONS THAT WE

01:26:56.344 --> 01:27:00.348
HAVE TO FOLLOW SO EVEN AT THAT

01:27:00.415 --> 01:27:01.249
IN TERMS OF INVESTMENTS THAT.

01:27:01.316 --> 01:27:03.918
IT'S ILLEGAL TO DO WHAT AT WHAT

01:27:03.985 --> 01:27:06.421
THE ACT OUT HIS SAD SO- THAT IS

01:27:06.487 --> 01:27:08.222
SOMETHING THAT WE TAKE VERY

01:27:08.289 --> 01:27:09.557
SERIOUSLY BECAUSE WE ARE PUBLIC

01:27:09.624 --> 01:27:12.627
CHARITY AND REGISTERED- HURTS

01:27:12.694 --> 01:27:14.462
TO A CUT LET'S INSIST. I KNOW

01:27:14.529 --> 01:27:15.463
WE'RE TRYING TO ASK A THE FIRST

01:27:15.530 --> 01:27:16.564
NAME IS KILEY AFTER A VERY

01:27:16.631 --> 01:27:18.633
BROAD QUESTION YEAH SO MY

01:27:22.870 --> 01:27:23.871
ALL VERY INTERESTING AND IT'S

01:27:23.938 --> 01:27:27.408
APPROPRIATE AND AVOIDING WHICH

01:27:27.475 --> 01:27:31.112
IS. A MEN'S AND CAN YOU TEST

01:27:31.179 --> 01:27:34.182

PART OF COMMITTEE FOUNDATION SO

01:27:41.456 --> 01:27:41.990
THAT THE COMMITTEE FOUNDATION

01:27:42.056 --> 01:27:43.024
OWNS THAT MONEY THE DONOR DOES

01:27:43.091 --> 01:27:43.658
NO LONGER NO LONGER OWNS THAT

01:27:43.725 --> 01:27:44.792
THEY GET THE TAX BENEFIT. AND

01:27:44.859 --> 01:27:45.360
SO THEY ARE HIGHLY REGULATED

01:27:45.426 --> 01:27:45.994
JUST LIKE COMMUNITY FOUNDATIONS

01:27:46.060 --> 01:27:46.594
ARE. THEY DON'T HAVE CONTROL

01:27:46.661 --> 01:27:48.563
THEY THEY CAN RECOMMEND AND

01:27:48.630 --> 01:27:50.665

RECOMMENDATIONS MADE THE DUE

01:27:51.699 --> 01:27:53.801
DILIGENCE COMMUNITY FOUNDATION.

01:27:53.868 --> 01:27:55.403
IS A STRONGER DILIGENCE. THEN

01:27:55.470 --> 01:27:57.872
THE MONEY WILL GO OUT IF THEY

01:27:57.939 --> 01:27:59.307

CAN'T DO THAT YEAH THEY CAN'T

01:28:08.850 --> 01:28:09.884

01:28:09.951 --> 01:28:10.485
THERE'S CERTAIN RULES

01:28:10.551 --> 01:28:11.753

PLACE- WE DON'T KNOW THIS TO BE

01:29:10.378 --> 01:29:12.613
THE CASE WITH THE COMMERCIAL

ORGANIZATIONS WE'RE NOT SURE.

MANAGING FUNDS. THE DONORS NOT

DONOR ON CHOOSING- FILL UP A

01:29:52.353 --> 01:29:54.288
GOAL IN FACT. THAT THE FUNDS

PRIDE THEMSELVES IN BEING

01:29:55.590 --> 01:29:59.327
AGNOSTIC NEUTRAL. THEY DON'T

01:29:59.393 --> 01:30:00.628
VIEW IT AS WHAT WE HEARD OF YOU

01:30:00.695 --> 01:30:03.531

01:30:06.601 --> 01:30:09.971
STAR. SO THAT'S A CONCERT.

MISTER KALRA. THANK YOU AND WE

HAVE A LOT OF REALLY GOOD

01:30:15.209 --> 01:30:16.144
PEOPLE AROUND THIS TABLE

01:30:16.210 --> 01:30:16.711
THEY'RE ALL TRYING TO DO THE

01:30:16.778 --> 01:30:17.245
RIGHT THING AND CLEAN THE

01:30:17.311 --> 01:30:19.280
AUTHOR- AND SO I APPRECIATE-

01:30:19.347 --> 01:30:21.182
BOTH THE COMPONENTS IN

01:30:21.249 --> 01:30:26.420
OPPOSITION- I DO THINK THAT THE

01:30:26.487 --> 01:30:29.157
THAT THAT IS AN ISSUE AND- I

01:30:29.223 --> 01:30:34.028
THINK THE BILL. UP ARE NOT A-

01:30:34.095 --> 01:30:34.996
CATCH ALL SOLUTION BUT I ALSO

01:30:35.062 --> 01:30:35.630
THINK IT DOES AS INDICATED BY

01:30:35.696 --> 01:30:37.231
OPPOSITION CREATE SOME MISSION

01:30:37.298 --> 01:30:38.432
THEIR PERSPECTIVE I REALLY

01:30:38.499 --> 01:30:40.401
APPRECIATE THE DIALOGUE THAT'S

01:30:40.468 --> 01:30:40.968
ALREADY OCCURRED HAS BEEN

01:30:41.035 --> 01:30:42.303
AMENDMENTS ALREADY BECAUSE OF

01:30:42.370 --> 01:30:44.071
THAT DIALOGUE THIS IS THE FIRST

01:30:44.138 --> 01:30:46.707
COMMITTEE AND SO AS AS AS- ARE

01:30:46.774 --> 01:30:48.075
OPPOSITION IS INDICATED THERE

01:30:48.142 --> 01:30:51.379
ARE STILL ALL YEARS AND WILLING

01:30:51.445 --> 01:30:52.480
TO SIT DOWN AND HAVE THE

01:30:52.547 --> 01:30:54.448
DIALOGUE WHICH I THINK IS A

01:30:54.515 --> 01:30:56.184
REALLY IMPORTANT ESPECIALLY AT

01:30:56.250 --> 01:31:00.521
THIS STAGE OF A WITH THE BILL

01:31:00.588 --> 01:31:04.058
IS. AND YOU KNOW OF COURSE IS.

01:31:04.125 --> 01:31:05.393
SELECT COMMITTEE FOUNDATION

01:31:05.459 --> 01:31:06.627
THOUGH. THAT THEY DO EVERY DAY.

01:31:06.694 --> 01:31:08.029
THIRTEEN APPRECIATED I DO THINK

01:31:08.095 --> 01:31:08.963
ONE OF THE ISSUES AS A SUMMER

01:31:09.030 --> 01:31:10.631
KILEY WAS INDICATING KIND OF

01:31:10.698 --> 01:31:11.799
WHAT THE BUT WHAT IS THE

01:31:11.866 --> 01:31:12.466
PROBLEM TRYING TO. WE'RE TRYING

01:31:12.533 --> 01:31:13.835
TO SOLVE YOUR THE FACT. OF AS

01:31:13.901 --> 01:31:15.269
MENTIONED THAT. FOLKS GET THE

01:31:15.336 --> 01:31:16.637
MONEY AND THEY GET THE TAX.

01:31:16.704 --> 01:31:18.940
BENEFIT IMMEDIATELY AND YET THE

01:31:19.006 --> 01:31:19.540
MONEY DOESN'T ACTUALLY GO OUT

01:31:19.607 --> 01:31:22.376
IMMEDIATELY. AND SO. THAT'S AN

01:31:22.443 --> 01:31:24.478
ISSUE THAT MAYBE THE TRASH I

01:31:24.545 --> 01:31:26.214
MEAN IF YOU GO OUT FOR THE TAX.

01:31:26.280 --> 01:31:28.182
ISSUE THAT'S ACTUALLY A MUCH

01:31:28.249 --> 01:31:29.717
PROBABLY BIGGER BILL IN TERMS

01:31:29.784 --> 01:31:31.619
OF THE OPPOSITION BUT YOU MAY

01:31:31.686 --> 01:31:32.887
BASED ON THAT. I THINK THE

01:31:32.954 --> 01:31:34.388
TRANSPARENCY AND GETTING MORE

01:31:34.455 --> 01:31:35.122
KNOWLEDGE AS TO WHAT'S

01:31:35.189 --> 01:31:36.924
HAPPENING. IS PROBABLY A MUCH

01:31:36.991 --> 01:31:41.229
MILDER FIRST APPROACH AS TO HOW

01:31:41.295 --> 01:31:41.796
YOU DEAL WITH THE ISSUE OF

01:31:41.863 --> 01:31:43.798
MONEY SITTING IDLE. AND DOGS I

01:31:43.865 --> 01:31:45.366
GET THE TAX BENEFIT GET IT.

01:31:45.433 --> 01:31:46.868
WHEN THEY GET A MILLION DOLLARS

01:31:46.934 --> 01:31:49.670
STOCKS THEY GET THAT TAX BREAK.

01:31:49.737 --> 01:31:51.839
THEY MAKE ABOUT THE MONEY. HAVE

01:31:51.906 --> 01:31:53.608
YEARS LATER ON THAT STOCKS WITH

01:31:53.674 --> 01:31:54.342
HALF A MILLION. AS THE

01:31:54.408 --> 01:31:56.611
COMMUNITIES CITY SAME MAKE THE

01:31:56.677 --> 01:31:57.712
SAME BENEFITS AS THE TIME TO

01:31:57.778 --> 01:31:59.313
BREAK THAT WAS. GIVEN AT THE

01:31:59.380 --> 01:32:00.181
TIME THAT WAS PUT INTO THE FUND

01:32:00.248 --> 01:32:02.216
SO THERE ARE A LOT OF DIFFERENT

01:32:02.283 --> 01:32:04.018
ANGLES. OF AND THAT THAT- THAT

01:32:04.085 --> 01:32:07.688
WE CAN APPROACH THIS ISSUE AT.

01:32:07.755 --> 01:32:09.557
BUT I THINK WE HAVE THE RIGHT

01:32:09.624 --> 01:32:15.129
THE TABLE TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT

01:32:15.196 --> 01:32:25.406
HOW TO. AND SO I APPRECIATE THE

01:32:25.473 --> 01:32:26.641
CHAIR'S RECOMMENDATION THE WORK

01:32:26.707 --> 01:32:28.509

PATH FORWARD AND I'M CONFIDENT-

01:32:34.482 --> 01:32:36.050
WITH THE PEOPLE. THAT WE HAVE

01:32:36.117 --> 01:32:37.251
HERE IN THIS ROOM AND OTHERS

01:32:37.318 --> 01:32:39.053

AND SUPPORT- DOUBLE BILL TO GET

01:32:42.356 --> 01:32:43.291
THAT DONE SO AS ONE EXPRESS MY

01:32:43.357 --> 01:32:44.926
THOUGHTS ON. THANK YOU OTHER

01:32:44.992 --> 01:32:47.361
QUESTIONS SUCH. I'M NOT GONNA

01:32:47.428 --> 01:32:48.095
GO IT MISTER KALRA JUST SAID

01:32:48.162 --> 01:32:49.563
BUT THE SENTIMENT IS ONE THAT I

01:32:49.630 --> 01:32:51.966
WANT TO REITERATE WHICH IS- I

01:32:52.033 --> 01:32:53.301
THINK EVERYONE INVOLVED IN THIS

01:32:53.367 --> 01:32:54.969
CONVERSATION ON BOTH SIDES OF

01:32:55.036 --> 01:32:57.338
THE SUPPORT OPPOSITION- REALLY

01:32:57.405 --> 01:32:58.272
DO MEAN WELL AND WE'RE TRYING

01:32:58.339 --> 01:33:01.108
TO. ACCOMPLISH THE SAME GOALS.

01:33:01.175 --> 01:33:03.110
AND I'M VERY SYMPATHETIC TO THE

01:33:03.177 --> 01:33:04.512
PICTURE THAT I THINK OF THE

01:33:04.578 --> 01:33:06.514
PRESENT LEAGUE HAD LAID OUT ON-

01:33:06.580 --> 01:33:08.449
SOME REASONS WHY. IN THESE

01:33:08.516 --> 01:33:09.750
FUNDS THEY MAY NOT BE SOME

01:33:09.817 --> 01:33:11.652
IMMEDIATE INVESTMENTS. THAT

01:33:11.719 --> 01:33:13.020
BEING SAID YOU KNOW WE ALL KNOW

OPPOSITE AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE

01:33:15.990 --> 01:33:17.425
TRYING TO. TO GRAPPLE WITH AND

01:33:17.491 --> 01:33:19.427

THE FOUNDATION WORLD I THINK

01:33:23.764 --> 01:33:25.132
IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO STATE

01:33:25.199 --> 01:33:26.434
THAT. BUT WE HAVE A STRUCTURE

01:33:26.500 --> 01:33:29.870

01:34:05.506 --> 01:34:06.507
FIGURE OUT THE RIGHT ANSWER

01:34:06.574 --> 01:34:08.409
HERE BECAUSE- LONGEST PLOWED

01:34:08.476 --> 01:34:09.110
REMAINS. IF THIS BILL DOES NOT

01:34:09.176 --> 01:34:10.745
FORD DOESN'T TAKE AWAY THE FACT

01:34:10.811 --> 01:34:12.146
THAT WE HAVE BILLIONAIRES WHO

01:34:12.213 --> 01:34:13.581
ARE TELLING US THIS IS A TAX

01:34:13.647 --> 01:34:16.650
LOOPHOLE AND WE HAVE FOLKS WHO

01:34:16.717 --> 01:34:19.553
STARTED THIS VEHICLE METHOD WHO

01:34:19.620 --> 01:34:20.588
HAVE SAID THERE'S A REAL

01:34:20.654 --> 01:34:23.124
PROBLEM HERE SO- SO MY HOPE IS

01:34:23.190 --> 01:34:24.725
WE CAN GET TO ANSWER WE STILL

01:34:24.792 --> 01:34:27.528
HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF TIME- AND

01:34:27.595 --> 01:34:30.498
THE REST OF THE YEAR SO- WITH

01:34:30.564 --> 01:34:30.998
THAT TO. LOOK FORWARD TO

01:34:31.065 --> 01:34:31.599
SUPPORTING THE TODAY CONTINUE

01:34:31.665 --> 01:34:33.768
THE CONVERSATION. THANK YOU. SO

01:34:33.834 --> 01:34:35.636
MUCH THANK YOU FOR WE SLOW THIS

01:34:35.703 --> 01:34:37.038
DOWN FROM LAST YEAR BECAUSE OF

01:34:37.104 --> 01:34:39.373
SOME OF THESE CONCERNS AND THE

01:34:39.440 --> 01:34:39.974
AMENDMENTS OR SOMETHING THAT

01:34:40.041 --> 01:34:42.076
WERE. VERY IMPORTANT TO ME.

01:34:42.143 --> 01:34:43.010
BECAUSE I THINK THERE IS A

01:34:43.077 --> 01:34:45.112
DIFFERENCE WHEN WE TALK ABOUT

01:34:45.179 --> 01:34:46.247
THE SCALE AND THIS IS REALLY

01:34:46.313 --> 01:34:48.082
WHAT WE TRIED TO DO. I WORK

01:34:48.149 --> 01:34:49.316
VERY CLOSELY WITH MY LOCAL

01:34:49.383 --> 01:34:50.684
COMMUNITY FOUNDATIONS AND

01:34:50.751 --> 01:34:51.552
ANOTHER MANY AROUND THE STATE

01:34:51.619 --> 01:34:54.855
AND I TRUST THEM. BECAUSE THEY

01:34:54.922 --> 01:34:58.059
ARE GOVERNED BY LOCAL MEMBRANE.

01:34:58.125 --> 01:35:00.661
AND BECAUSE OF THAT I THINK A

01:35:00.728 --> 01:35:02.263
LOT OF THE CONCERNS ABOUT MONEY

01:35:02.329 --> 01:35:04.565
NOT MOVE IT ABOUT. NOT MAKING

01:35:04.632 --> 01:35:06.267
THE RIGHT INVESTMENTS IN THE

01:35:06.333 --> 01:35:07.201
COMMUNITY ARE SOMEWHAT OUT OF

01:35:07.268 --> 01:35:08.602
IT. I THINK THE MEMBERS OF THE

01:35:08.669 --> 01:35:10.771
GOVERNANCE OF LOCAL COMMUNITY

01:35:10.838 --> 01:35:12.406
FOUNDATIONS. AND SPECIALLY

01:35:12.473 --> 01:35:13.908
THOSE THAT THAT I'M FAMILIAR

01:35:13.974 --> 01:35:16.577
WITH. WOULD NOT STAND FOR THAT

01:35:16.644 --> 01:35:17.111
RIGHT AND HAVE TO ANSWER

01:35:17.178 --> 01:35:19.313
ULTIMATELY TO THE COMMUNITY. SO

01:35:19.380 --> 01:35:20.514
TO ME THAT'S NOT WHAT THE

01:35:20.581 --> 01:35:21.615
PROBLEM IS. AND IT SILICON

01:35:21.682 --> 01:35:23.984
VALLEY WE WILL BE SET A

01:35:24.051 --> 01:35:27.621
STANDARD TO TRY AND- AN EXAM

01:35:27.688 --> 01:35:30.091
THESE LOCAL ESPECIALLY SMALLER.

01:35:30.157 --> 01:35:30.758
THAT IT IS BECAUSE OF THAT

01:35:30.825 --> 01:35:31.392
LEVEL OF GOVERNANCE SO I DON'T

01:35:31.459 --> 01:35:32.593
THINK WITH WILL SEE THAT THE

01:35:32.660 --> 01:35:34.395
CHALLENGES THAT. THAT THIS BILL

01:35:34.462 --> 01:35:36.130
BRINGS UP IN. AND I THINK THOSE

01:35:36.197 --> 01:35:37.631
ARE SIGNIFICANT IF THE TAX LAW

01:35:37.698 --> 01:35:40.201
HAS CREATED THIS LOOPHOLE FOR.

01:35:40.267 --> 01:35:41.168
FOR WEALTHY PEOPLE TO PARK

01:35:41.235 --> 01:35:43.604
MONEY. IN THE NAME OF BENEFITS

01:35:43.671 --> 01:35:45.106
COMMUNITY AND NOT PROVIDING

01:35:45.172 --> 01:35:45.873
THAT BENEFITS THE COMMUNITY

01:35:45.940 --> 01:35:46.774
THAT IS SOMETHING WE SHOULD ALL

01:35:46.841 --> 01:35:48.275
BE CONCERNED ABOUT. SO THE

01:35:48.342 --> 01:35:50.444
LEVEL OF TRYING TO FIND. THE

01:35:50.511 --> 01:35:52.746
RIGHT MECHANISM HERE TO BUILD

01:35:52.813 --> 01:35:54.582
IN TRANSPARENCY TO WHAT IS

01:35:54.648 --> 01:35:56.851
HAPPENING. AND THEN SEE WHAT

01:35:56.917 --> 01:35:58.919
OTHER STEPS MIGHT BE TAKEN I

01:35:58.986 --> 01:35:59.487
THINK IS ABSOLUTELY LAUDABLE

01:35:59.553 --> 01:36:01.522
AND THAT'S THE GOAL HERE. THERE

01:36:01.589 --> 01:36:03.124
ARE SOME LARGER FOUNDATIONS AND

01:36:03.190 --> 01:36:04.358
SILICON VALLEY IT AND OTHERS

01:36:04.425 --> 01:36:07.361
THAT ARE. THAT ARE BIG ENOUGH

01:36:07.428 --> 01:36:08.462
AND SO WE SET THAT NUMBER TO

01:36:08.529 --> 01:36:10.097
TRY ANY CAPSULE EIGHT. THE

01:36:10.164 --> 01:36:11.198
LION'S SHARE OF THE COMMUNITY

01:36:11.265 --> 01:36:13.567
FOUNDATIONS BECAUSE I GET THOSE

01:36:13.634 --> 01:36:15.169
ARGUMENTS IT'S I DON'T KNOW

01:36:15.236 --> 01:36:16.504
THAT THEY THEY NEED TO BE SWEPT

01:36:16.570 --> 01:36:17.872
UP IN THIS. THE LARGER THE

01:36:17.938 --> 01:36:19.240
COMMERCIAL FUNDS YEAH I THINK

01:36:19.306 --> 01:36:20.608
THAT'S VERY MUCH A LEGITIMATE

01:36:20.674 --> 01:36:23.277
QUESTION. QUESTIONS OF PRIVACY.

01:36:23.344 --> 01:36:24.111
ABSOLUTELY REMAIN IN THIS

01:36:24.178 --> 01:36:26.747
LEGISLATURE IS VERY SENSITIVE

01:36:26.814 --> 01:36:28.883
TO. PRIVACY WE OF LONG FOUGHT

01:36:28.949 --> 01:36:30.351
THOSE. PRIVACY CONCERNS TRYING

01:36:30.417 --> 01:36:32.520
TO CREATE. GIVE CALIFORNIANS

01:36:32.586 --> 01:36:33.888
CONFIDENCE IN THE DECISIONS

01:36:33.954 --> 01:36:35.789
THAT THEY MAY BUT THERE ARE

01:36:35.856 --> 01:36:37.291
SOME UNIQUE ATTRIBUTES OF THE

01:36:37.358 --> 01:36:39.226
WAY. CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS AND

01:36:39.293 --> 01:36:42.263
THAT WEALTH AND- OR- COULD BE

01:36:42.329 --> 01:36:45.065
IDENTIFIED. THAT VERSUS THE-

01:36:45.132 --> 01:36:46.901
THE GOALS WERE TRYING TO

01:36:46.967 --> 01:36:47.968
ACCOMPLISH HERE AT THE

01:36:48.035 --> 01:36:49.203
MISERABLE IS RIGHT TO THE THOSE

01:36:49.270 --> 01:36:50.771
ARE THINGS WE HAVE TO BALANCE.

01:36:50.838 --> 01:36:52.439
AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE

01:36:52.506 --> 01:36:53.374
TO IN THIS OR OTHERS GET

01:36:53.440 --> 01:36:56.310
EVERYTHING ABSOLUTELY PERFECT.

01:36:56.377 --> 01:36:57.077
BUT I THINK THIS UNDERLYING

01:36:57.144 --> 01:36:58.913
NEED TO FIND THE INFORMATION.

01:36:58.979 --> 01:37:01.582
FIGURE OUT WHAT IS GOING ON.

01:37:01.649 --> 01:37:03.050
AND IT ARE THERE THEN FURTHER

01:37:03.117 --> 01:37:04.852
STEPS WE NEED TO TAKE MAYBE

01:37:04.919 --> 01:37:06.020
MAYBE NOT I DON'T THINK THAT'S

01:37:06.086 --> 01:37:07.655
BEEN SETTLED YET AT THIS POINT.

01:37:07.721 --> 01:37:09.323
BUT WE NEED THAT INFORMATION

01:37:09.390 --> 01:37:11.358
AND GIVING. THAT WHAT WE DO

01:37:11.425 --> 01:37:12.860
KNOW ABOUT AT LEAST AT THE

01:37:12.927 --> 01:37:14.094
LARGEST LEVEL AND WHAT'S AT

01:37:14.161 --> 01:37:16.997
STAKE THERE ARE SOME CONCERNS

01:37:17.064 --> 01:37:18.132
TO BE ABLE TO RAISE THAT THAT'S

01:37:18.199 --> 01:37:20.701
KIND OF WHAT. THE GIVE AND TAKE

01:37:20.768 --> 01:37:22.636
WAS THROUGH THE FALL AND- THE

01:37:22.703 --> 01:37:24.104
NUMBER OF MEETINGS THAT STAFF

01:37:24.171 --> 01:37:25.773
YOUR STAFF PEOPLE AROUND THE

01:37:25.839 --> 01:37:28.275
TABLE HAVE. HAVE BEEN TO TRY

01:37:28.342 --> 01:37:29.877
AND SORT THIS OUT THAT THAT'LL

01:37:29.944 --> 01:37:31.812
TIMIDLY. GOALS SO I DO

01:37:31.879 --> 01:37:33.180
UNDERSTAND WHY THE COMMUNITY

01:37:33.247 --> 01:37:35.950
FOUNDATION LEAGUE IS OPPOSED TO

01:37:36.016 --> 01:37:36.483
IT AT THAT THIS SETS AND A

01:37:36.550 --> 01:37:38.752
LITTLE BIT CONCERNED. BY WE TRY

01:37:38.819 --> 01:37:40.854
TO DEAL WITH SOME OF THAT. NOT

01:37:40.921 --> 01:37:42.856
ALL OF IT BUT MOST OF IT.

01:37:42.923 --> 01:37:44.558
BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF WHAT

01:37:44.625 --> 01:37:46.293
COMMUNITY FOUNDATIONS DO WHEN

01:37:46.360 --> 01:37:49.230
AND WHAT THEY REPRESENT. SO

01:37:49.296 --> 01:37:50.397
FROM THIS COMMITTEE STANDPOINT

01:37:50.464 --> 01:37:51.699
I THINK WE'VE COME TO A POINT

01:37:51.765 --> 01:37:53.334
WHERE I THINK IT'S WORTHY OF

01:37:53.400 --> 01:37:54.468
PASSING THIS THROUGH AND I HOPE

01:37:54.535 --> 01:37:55.736
WE DO PASSES THROUGH AT THIS

01:37:55.803 --> 01:37:57.238
POINT. THE JOB APPROPRIATIONS

01:37:57.304 --> 01:37:59.006
MS WAKES YOU UP THE FLOOR SWEPT

01:37:59.073 --> 01:38:01.408
THE SENATE WHERE A LOT OF THESE

01:38:01.475 --> 01:38:03.043
QUESTIONS ARE GOING TO STILL

01:38:03.110 --> 01:38:04.245
COME UP AND HAVE WE CREATED THE

01:38:04.311 --> 01:38:06.447
RIGHT BALANCE HERE. I THINK FOR

01:38:06.513 --> 01:38:08.983
THIS COMMITTEE YES BUT IN THE

01:38:09.049 --> 01:38:12.119
LONG RUN I THINK WE HAVE A LOT

01:38:12.186 --> 01:38:12.753
TO LEARN ABOUT BUT I DO WANT TO

01:38:12.820 --> 01:38:14.555
MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE. TEXTING

01:38:14.622 --> 01:38:16.824
THE LOCAL SMALLER ONES WHO ARE

01:38:16.890 --> 01:38:17.925
MAKING THOSE INVESTMENTS AND

01:38:17.992 --> 01:38:19.293
ARE MAKING THOSE INVESTMENTS.

01:38:19.360 --> 01:38:21.495
LOCALLY AND NOT NECESSARILY

01:38:21.562 --> 01:38:23.631
CARRYING MONEY FOR. OUT OF

01:38:23.697 --> 01:38:25.833
STATE OUT OF COUNTRY KINDS OF

01:38:25.899 --> 01:38:27.568
INVESTMENTS BECAUSE- THOSE

01:38:27.635 --> 01:38:29.470
THEN. I THINK RAISE THE

01:38:29.536 --> 01:38:32.039
QUESTION YET AGAIN. ABOUT THE

01:38:32.106 --> 01:38:33.774
PROPRIETY OF HOW THESE

01:38:33.841 --> 01:38:34.942
INVESTMENTS ARE OR ARE NOT

01:38:35.009 --> 01:38:36.343
BEING MADE YEAH SO YOU'VE

01:38:36.410 --> 01:38:38.545
RAISED. A DIFFICULT ISSUE AN

01:38:38.612 --> 01:38:41.148
INTERESTING ISSUE YES. AND

01:38:41.215 --> 01:38:43.250
UNFORTUNATELY ONE THAT. I THINK

01:38:43.317 --> 01:38:44.385
THE PROBLEM IS WELL

01:38:44.451 --> 01:38:46.854
ARTICULATED. BUT THE FAX AROUND

01:38:46.920 --> 01:38:49.556
IT ARE NOT NECESSARILY RIGHT

01:38:49.623 --> 01:38:51.492
AND THAT'S WHAT. THE DEAL THE

01:38:51.558 --> 01:38:53.427
WERE CRAFTING SOMETHING THAT

01:38:53.494 --> 01:38:55.229
CAN GO TO DISCOVER THOSE FACTS

01:38:55.296 --> 01:38:57.298
AND FIGURE OUT WHAT WE NEED TO

01:38:57.364 --> 01:38:59.366
