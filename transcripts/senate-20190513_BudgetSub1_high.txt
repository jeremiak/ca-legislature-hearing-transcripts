LET'S -- I HAVE YOU ALL INTRODUCE YOURSELVES FOR THE RECORD -- TRIED AT THE WHAT THE TEST WE'RE GONNA START AT THE TABLE TO MY LEFT YOU'RE RIGHT AND THAT'S USER.

IN BOSTON HOUSE IN WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE INTERESTING HASN'T GOOD TO HAVE YOU BACK. THE THINKING WITH LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. JASON CONCENTRA SLUDGE ANALYST'S OFFICE. OKAY WAS TO START. THIS IS A HIGHER EDUCATION. ANY SO TAKE ORDERS WILL BEGIN WITH THE FINANCIALLY PROPOSALS AND SOON A COMMISSION. SO THE MAY REVISION PROPOSES TOTAL FINANCIAL AID EXPENDITURES OF JUST OVER TWO POINT EIGHT BILLION. TWO TIMES DURING THE YEAR AT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AT THE MAY REVISION WE UPDATE THE ESTIMATES THAT ARE INVOLVED IN DETERMINING THE TOTAL COST OF THE STATE'S FINANCIAL AID PROGRAMS. SO THE AS YOUR AGENDA NOTES THERE ARE NUMBER OF ADJUSTMENTS THOSE PROGRAMS WERE HAPPY TO GO INTO DEPTH ON ANY OF THEM. TO KIND OF SPEAK UP A HIGH LEVEL THE MOST IMPORTANT POLICY PROPOSALS ARE THE PROPOSAL OF EIGHTY NINE POINT EIGHT MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND FOR THE COMMISSION TO ADMINISTER AND CREATE A NEW LOAN FORGIVENESS. PROGRAM FOR TEACHERS WHO MEETS SPECIFIED CRITERIA AND YOU TEACH OF CERTAIN SCHOOLS. IN ADDITION TO THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING THAT THE FIFTY MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND FOR CHILD SAVINGS ACCOUNTS BE ADMINISTERED BY THIS YOU NEED COMMISSION. AND FURTHER THE FIVE MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND THAT WAS PROPOSED FOR THE OFFICE OF PLANNING AND RICH AND RESEARCH TO ADMINISTER. A STUDENT LOAN AWARENESS INITIATIVE THE ADMINISTRATION OF THAT PROGRAM HAS BEEN TRANSFERRED TO THE US YOU NEED COMMISSION. IN ADDITION WE'RE PROPOSING THROUGH TRAILER BILL TO MOVE OUT THE DEADLINE FOR A PRIVATE NONPROFIT INSTITUTIONS TO MEET AN ASSOCIATE DEGREE FOR TRANSFER THRESHOLD TO MAINTAIN THEIR MAXIMUM CAL GRANT TUITION AWARD. AT NINE THOUSAND EIGHTY FOUR DOLLARS BY ONE YEAR SO THEY NOW HAVE AN ADDITIONAL YEAR TO RAMP UP THE AT T. PATHWAY FOR STUDENTS PURSUING -- THEIR HIGHER EDUCATION A PRIVATE NONPROFIT INSTITUTIONS. HAVE AN ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS OKAY THANK YOU [inaudible] HELLO [inaudible] THANK YOU. AS THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IS NEEDED THE MUSICIAN DOES CONTAIN A NUMBER OF ONE TIME PROPOSALS FOR THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION. I'LL BE SPEAKING TO THE THREE PROPOSALS THAT ARE LISTED ON PAGE SIX OF YOUR AGENDA. THE MOST NOTABLE OF THESE PROPOSALS FOR FUTURE SERVICE CREDIT SCHOLARSHIP. AT ABOUT NINETY MILLION ONE TIME THIS IS AMONG THE LARGEST NAY REVISION PROPOSALS FOR EDUCATION AND AS A RESULT WE THINK IT MERITS FOR THE CONSIDERATION FROM THE SUBCOMMITTEE. WELL THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE FOR THIS PROGRAM IS NOT YET FINAL WE DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS BASED ON THE INFORMATION CURRENTLY AVAILABLE. OUR CONCERNS PRIMARILY RELATE TO WHTHER THE PROPOSAL WOULD HAVE A SUSTAINED IMPACT ON THE FUTURE WORK FORCE. AS WELL AS WHETHER THE INCENTIVE IT CREATES AS WELL TIMED AND OFTEN HAVE TEACHERS CREDIT DECISION. THE STATE HAS PREVIOUSLY FUNDED PROGRAMS THAT PROVIDE SIMILAR FINANCIAL INCENTIVES TEACHERS IN SHORTAGE AREAS. MOST NOTABLY THE ASSUMPTION PROGRAM PLANS FOR EDUCATION ADMINISTERED DID STUDENT AID COMMISSION PREVIOUSLY. WE THINK THAT THE LESSONS LEARNED FROM THESE PROGRAMS COULD ALLOW THE LEGISLATURE TO STRENGTHEN THIS PROPOSAL. IF THE LEGISLATURE WHERE TO APPROVE THE PROPOSAL IN SOME FORM WE THINK IT MAY ALSO WISH TO DIRECT THE STUDENT A COMMISSION REPORT AND PROGRAM OUTCOMES HAS THIS INFORMATION COULD GUIDE FUTURE DECISIONS ABOUT USING THIS TYPE OF FINANCIAL INCENTIVE. TO ADDRESS TEACHER SHORTAGES. SECONDLY IS THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IS NOTED THE MERE VISION DOES ALSO IDENTIFIED A STUDENT A COMMISSION IS THE DEPARTMENT TO ADMINISTER THE CHILD SAVINGS ACCOUNT GRANT PROGRAM. WHICH THE SUBCOMMITTEE HAD LAST MONTH. WHEN THIS PROPOSAL RESEMBLES AN EXISTING INITIATIVE CREATED IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN CALLED EVERY KID COUNTS ALSO ADMINISTERED THROUGH THE STATE MADE COMMISSION? AS THE STUDENT A QUESTION JUST RECENTLY ANNOUNCED THE GRANTEES REPLICATE COUNTS WE THINK THAT COULD BE CONSIDERED PREMATURE TO CREATE A NEW INITIATIVE BEFORE WE HAVE SOME SHORT TERM OUTCOMES LESSONS AND FROM THE EXISTING. ONE FINALLY THE MERRY VISION TRANSFERS FIVE MILLION ONE TIME FOR STUDENT LOAN AWARENESS ACTIVITIES FROM THE OFFICE OF PLANNING RESEARCH THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION. GIVEN THE FIRST ACTIVITIES OF YOUR DUPLICATE EFFORTS FROM THE US DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. THE SECOND FOR THE COLLEGES. AND ALSO VERIFY FOR SECONDARY EDUCATION. WOULD YOU RECOMMEND LEGISLATURE REJECTED PROPOSAL. THANK YOU I'D BE HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. ANY COMMENTS FROM THE TABLE IN FRONT OF ME YES SIR. GOOD MORNING DAVID O'BRIEN WITH A CALIFORNIA STUDENT A COMMISSION AS ALWAYS WHEN I THINK THE ADMINISTRATION FOR WORKING WITH US ON REVISED ESTIMATES OF OUR CAL GRANT SPENDING VERY COMPLEX PROGRAM WITH PROJECTIONS AND ESTIMATES THAT -- DO FLUCTUATE FROM JANUARY TO MAY SO -- THEY'VE BEEN VERY HELPFUL -- WE HAVEN'T HAD TIME TO COMPLETE A FULL ANALYSIS OF THE NEW PROPOSALS IN THE MAY REVISE JUST WANT TO SAY THAT AND YOU KNOW OVERALL WE APPRECIATE THE NEW INVESTMENTS IN HIGHER EDUCATION IN COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY. THAT THIS BUDGET REFLECTS -- AND WE STILL WORK LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH STAKEHOLDERS AND LEGISLATORS ON A COMPREHENSIVE FINANCIAL AID REFORM I DO WANT TO NOTE -- ONE ITEM THAT I COULD AT LEAST BE PARTIALLY RESPONSIBLE SOME CONCERNS OF THIS SUBCOMMITTEE HAD RAISED. WHICH I THE CHILD SAVINGS ACCOUNTS WHEN -- I WAS HERE A WEEK OR TWO AGO -- THAT MEMBERS OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE HAD EXPRESSED SOME CONCERN THAT THE EXISTING PROGRAM THAT WERE RUNNING -- IT DIDN'T INCLUDE PROGRAMS IN SOME REGIONS OF THE STATE -- AND THAT MAY HAVE BEEN DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE LANGUAGE IN THE EVERY KID COUNTS PROGRAM WHICH IS THE CURRENT PROGRAM. DID NOT ALLOW FOR THE FUNDS TO BE USED FOR START UP FOR SORT OF JUMP START FUNDS AND THIS PROPOSAL IN THE REVISED. INCLUDE A SPECIFIC SET ASIDE ABOUT THREE QUARTERS OF THE FUNDS PARTY'S DESIGNATED FOR NEW PROGRAMS TO SORT OF HELP THEM GET OFF THE GROUND SO -- WITH ANY LUCK IF IT WERE TO BE APPROVED WE WOULD -- WANT TO WORK WITH YOUR OFFICES AND WITH OTHER ORGANIZATIONS LEADING CALIFORNIA CITIES AND SO FORTH TRYING TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE COVERING MORE REASONS OF THE STATE INCLUDING THOSE THAT -- THAT MEMBERS OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE HAD MENTIONED AT THE LAST HEARING ON THIS. THANK YOU YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS REGARDING THE LA OWES. ANALYSIS OF I GUESS IT WAS THE TEACHERS SERVICE CREDIT SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM. IN THE COMMENTED PROSPECTIVE APPLICANTS WOULD NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE PROGRAM BEFORE THEY DECIDE WHICH SUBJECT HERE ISN'T SCHOOLS TO TEACH AND AND THE FOLLOWING COMMENTS ABOUT HOW THAT MAY NOT BE POSSIBLE. WE CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THE CONCERN -- AND WE WOULD WANT -- TO PROBABLY WORK WITH THE ADMINISTRATION TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS SOME ALLOWANCE IN THE LANGUAGE -- IF THERE'S A DESIRE TO DO SO FROM -- FROM THE LEGISLATURE TO DO SOME OUTREACH ON THE FRONT END -- SO WE'D BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE ON THAT THE ADMINISTRATION TO SEE IF -- TO SEE IF THAT CONCERN CAN BE ADDRESSED FINANCE WAS THAT JUST SIMPLY AN UNINTENDED. DEVELOPMENT SO I I THINK THE KIND OF ONE IMPORTANT FACTOR OF THE PROPOSALS THAT WE DO REQUIRE THIS YOU NEED COMMISSION TO WORK WITH THE COMMISSION ON TEACHER CREDENTIALING. TO KIND OF IDENTIFY WHERE THOSE BEST OPPORTUNITIES TO REACH TEACHERS TO INFORM THEIR DECISION FROM THE ADMINISTRATION'S PERSPECTIVE THIS PROPOSAL ISN'T NECESSARILY ABOUT TACKLING THE LARGE TEACHER SHORTAGE THAT EXIST IN THE STATE. BUT RATHER IT'S A ONE TO PURSUE TEACHING THAT'S SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN SCHOOL SITES THAT HAVE HIGH NUMBERS OF PROVISIONAL OR CONDITIONAL WAIVERS. SO IN OTHER WORDS ARE YOU SAYING THIS. THE TEACHERS ARE GOING TO BE WHERE THEY ARE AND AND AND THEY'RE GONNA QUALIFY WHERE THEY ARE. A NOT NECESSARILY I THINK I THINK THE POINT IS OF THE PROPOSALS THAT THE TWO COMMISSIONS WORKING TOGETHER WILL DEVELOP. A LIST OF WHICH SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF THESE PROVISIONAL WAIVERS AND PERMITS. AND HEN BASED ON THAT THEY'LL PRIORITIZE AWARDING THE GRANTS TO STUDENTS WERE TEACHING IN HIGH PRIORITY AREAS SUCH AS STEM FIELDS OUT THOSE SCHOOL SITES. I SEE. AND IF I MAY ADD TO THAT DRUG JUST BEFORE THIS HEARING AID NOTIFIED YOUR STAFF THAT WE'RE CONTINUING TO WORK ON THE LANGUAGE FOR THIS PROPOSAL. AND WILL ATTEMPT TO GET THAT YOUR STAFF AS QUICKLY IN ITS EXPOSITION EXPEDITIOUSLY AS WE CAN [inaudible] PERFECT. ANYTHING FURTHER ON THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE. COLLEAGUES ANY QUESTIONS THEIR LEVEL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR GOOD MORNING EVERYONE HAPPY MONDAY. I HAVE A QUESTION -- I BELIEVE IN THE SPIRIT OF THE PROPOSAL TO PROVIDE FUNDS FOR RAPID -- RESPONSE FOR HOMELESS AND THE HOUSING NEEDS OF IN OF OUR IN SECURE STUDENTS. BUT I AM VERY CONCERNED THAT IT DOESN'T GO TO OUR MOST VULNERABLE POPULATION AND WE'RE NOT HELPING STUDENTS THAT NEED IT THE MOST. SOME WONDERING AND I'M NOT SURE WHO ARE ONCE ANSWER THE QUESTION CAN -- WHAT THE RATIONALE IS FOR EXCLUDING LOW INCOME COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS? OR ACTUALLY ONCE THAT ARE FACING THE HIGHEST NON TUITION COSTS. AND SO THE THE PROPOSAL IS SIDE. THREE POINT FIVE MILLION GENERAL FUND THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIANS SIX POINT FIVE MILLION TO THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY -- THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES WERE NOT INCLUDED WITHIN THAT PROPOSAL -- BASED UPON THE AVAILABLE RESOURCES WITHIN PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT SO I DON'T THINK IT WAS NECESSARILY. A JUDGMENT CALL AS TO THE IMPORTANCE OF OF RAPID RE HOUSING -- FOR VULNERABLE POPULATION SO MUCH AS IT WAS THE AVAILABLE RESOURCES WITHIN THE GUARANTEE. SO IT. IS THERE MORE MONEY IMPROPER NINETY EIGHT THAT I DIDN'T SEE THAT'S GOING TO HELP THEM. NO I THINK WHAT WHAT WERE INSINUATING IT'S THAT THE PROPOSITION NINETY PACKAGE GLOBALLY. IT WAS VERY TIGHT THIS YEAR AND DIDN'T ENABLE US. TO MAKE THAT TYPE OF INVESTMENT AT THIS TIME. OKAY -- EVEN THOUGH THERE PUBLIC THE ONES THAT NEED IT THE MOST. YEAH I WOULD CERTAINLY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE IS A NEED IN THE SYSTEM OKAY SO IS THERE ANY OTHER. ANOTHER APPROACH THAT WE CAN TAKE HOW DO WE HELP THESE STUDENTS. YOU KNOW I MEAN I MEAN IF I WAS A STUDENT I WAS JUST LOOK AT MY CELL THEY'RE GIVING ME THE UC'S AGREEMENT THIS ISSUES BUT THEY JUST CLEARLY DON'T CARE ABOUT ME AS A COMMUNICATOR STUDENT. SO I THINK WE'LL CRTAINLY WORK WITH THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE TO SEE IF THERE ARE ALTERNATIVES I KNOW IN THE PAST THAT THERE HAVE BEEN ALTERNATIVES -- THAT HAVE BEEN LEGISLATIVELY CONSIDERED -- SUCH AS EMERGENCY GRANTS -- THINGS OF THAT NATURE OF WE'VE ALSO HEARD IN THAT BILL LAST I BELIEVE IT WAS LAST SESSION THAT THERE WAS A BILL TO THAT. AFFECT THE WOULD ALSO SAY THAT A COMMUNITY COLLEGE ISN'T PRECLUDED FROM USING SOME OF ITS FUNDING FOR THIS PURPOSE -- THERE'S A A A CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE LEGAL INTERPRETATION THEN. AT THIS TIME INDICATES THAT THEY CAN'T DO SO. OKAY. ALRIGHT BUT HOPE WE CANNOT FIGURE SOMETHING OUT FOR THE STUDENTS -- AND I ALSO WANT TO EXPRESS MY SUPPORT FOR THE ONE TIME FIVE MILLION BECAUSE THE TWO AREAS OF THE STATE THAT ARE MOST LIKELY IMPACTED BY THAT. IS THE INLAND EMPIRE -- WHICH IS MY DISTRICT AND CENTER RAS DISTRICT AND THEN ALSO THE THE CENTRAL VALLEY SO IF IF WE'RE IT IT. FIVE MILLION DOLLARS MAY NOT SEEM LIKE A LOT BUT IT'S SOMETHING THAT COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE STUDENTS THAT WE REPRESENT SO I WOULD WHOLEHEARTEDLY SUPPORT THE FIVE MILLION. IF YOU MISTER CHAIR. OF THE QUESTIONS. ZERO OKAY LET'S GO ON TO MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER -- TWO THIS IS -- ITEM SIXTY ONE HUNDRED DEPRIVED OF EDUCATION AND THE MORE. WHO'S COVERING THE UCC ISSUE WOULD YOU LIKE TO SPEAK. TWICE AS EVERYTHING ELSE. YES CENTER AND SALAS YOU NUMBER ONE TO ME SO. CONTINUE AND IT ON ISSUE NUMBER ONE THAT. THE MAY REVISION CONTINUES THE SIGNIFICANT ONGOING AND ONE TIME INVESTMENT TO THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA AND THEN MAKES. A FEW OF AMENDMENTS -- FIRST ADJUSTMENT WE ARE PROPOSING IN A REVISION AS TWENTY FIVE MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND TO SUPPORT UC'S EFFORTS TO REDUCE UNFUNDED LIABILITIES IN THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA RETIREMENT PLAN -- WE ARE ALSO PROVIDING THREE POINT FIVE MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND FOR DYSLEXIA SCREENING PILOT OPERATED BY THE UCSF DYSLEXIA CENTER. THIS PILOT WILL LEVERAGE YOU ADD NEW TECHNOLOGICAL APPLICATION TO IDENTIFY LEARNING DISABILITIES EARLIER. AND SUPPORT INTERVENTIONS. ARE ALSO PROPOSING THREE POINT FIVE MILLION ONGOING GENERAL FUND FOR RAPID RE HOUSING AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. AND THE MAYOR VISION IS A PROVIDING ADDITIONAL CLARITY AS TO THE USES OF THE EXISTING FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLAR ONGOING GENERAL FUND PROPOSAL FORCED TO ADDRESSED IN HUNGER AND HOMELESSNESS. SPECIFICALLY IDENTIFYING USES INCLUDING FOOD PANTRIES. CAL FRESHMAN ROLE MET MEAL DONATION PLANS AND AND SPECIFIC EFFORTS TO REDUCE STUDENT HOMELESSNESS -- CONTINUING OUR CONVERSATION FROM GOVERNOR'S BUDGET -- THE MAY REVISION ALSO AUTHORIZES THE YOU SEE THESE FIVE MILLION OF THE HUNDRED THIRTY EIGHT MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE. TO CONDUCT OF A PLAN FACILITIES ASSESSMENT -- WHILE WE'RE ON THE UC UC HASTINGS I WILL BE RECEIVING FIVE OR NINETY FOUR THOUSAND GENERAL FUND ONE TIMES FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF YOU SEE PATH. AND THE MARRIAGE AND ALSO EXPANDS THE AUTHORIZED USES OF ITS ONE MILLION. IN A ONE TIME DEFERRED MAINTENANCE FUNDING TO INCLUDE CLASSROOM UPGRADES IN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IMPROVEMENTS. WILL THE ASSESSMENT ALSO INCLUDE -- IN ADDITION. TO WHAT WE WOULD NORMALLY CONSIDER DEFERRED MAINTENANCE -- OF THE SIZE AND MAGNITUDE OF THE SEISMIC RETROFIT THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE. IF ANY. IN THE UC SYSTEM. OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE ASSESSMENT DOES NOT THIS PARTICULAR INFRASTRUCTURE ASSESSMENT WILL NOT BE FOR THE SEISMIC STUDIES BUT WE ARE CONDUCTING DOT SEPARATELY. WHEN WHEN DO YOU EXPECT THAT TO BE COMPLETED? I THE REASON I ASK IS I'VE SPENT SIX YEARS ON THE HEALTH COMMITTEE DEALING WITH HOSPITALS AND SEISMIC IN. IN LISTENING TO THIS DEFERRED MAINTENANCE BACKLOG AT C. ISSUE IN. UC'S SINCE I'VE HAD THIS BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE IT OCCURRED TO ME THE OTHER DAY WHEN I HAD HASTINGS IN HERE TO ASK. HOW THEY WERE DOING FROM A SEISMIC STANDPOINT SO I I WANT TO INCLUDE THAT IN MY? RANGE OF QUESTIONS AND NOT TO PUT ANY PRESSURE ON AS YOU DO COMPLETE THE STUDY OF LIKE TO SEE A COPY OF THE REPORT GO TO THE COMMITTEE STAFF SO WE CAN HAVE AN IDEA OF WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IN TERMS OF SEISMIC REPAIR. AND RENOVATION REPLACEMENT AS AS NECESSARY YES CENTER ROTH ALL MAKE CERTAIN THAT YOUR STAFF HAVE A COPY OF THAT REPORT WHEN IT BECOMES AVAILABLE. THE REGION'S DID ADOPT A POLICY THAT STATES THAT ALL OF THE UC BUILDINGS HAVE TO BE REASSESSED BY -- TWENTY THIRTY SO I'M NOT CERTAIN EXACTLY WHAT OUR TIME LINE EVERYBODY DID THE CAN IS THERE A WAY TO GET A BETTER ASSESSMENT ON THE SEISMIC SITUATION BEFORE TWENTY THIRTY THAT'S A LONG TIME. FROM NOW. POTENTIALLY S. OF I I WILL CHECK IN WITH OUR CAPITAL OUTLAY FOLKS AND GET YOUR DATE BY WHEN WE EXPECT THE STUDY TO BE COMPLETE I DON'T WANT TO PUT YOU ON THE HOT SEAT I MEAN. THERE'S SEVERAL SEVERAL CAMPUSES DON'T NEED TO WORRY THEY THEY HAVE TO BUY LIFE BOATS BUT OTHERS YOU NO NEED TO WORRY ABOUT SEISMIC ISSUES AND I THINK WE OUGHT TO HAVEWE AT LEAST IN THE LEGISLATURE. I HAVE AN IDEA OF HOW MUCH MONEY WE'RE LOOKING AT SO WE CAN PLAN ON HOW TO GET IT DONE -- PROBABLY SOONER RATHER THAN LATER THANK YOU THOUGH OKAY [inaudible] HELLO. SURE IF IT'S UNLESS YOU'D LIKE TO INCLUDE CSU AND THEN GO TO THE LA OR IF YOU'D LIKE TO COVER YOU SEE ISSUES FINE PERFECT. I DON'T HAVE A BATTING ORDER ON HERE SO PLEASE JUMP IN AND SWING CERTAINLY WILL WELL AT THE THE CSU IN AS WELL -- THERE IS THE SIX POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT FOR RAPID RE HOUSING THAT WAS PREVIOUSLY NOTED ADDITIONALLY THE MAY ROTATION INCLUDES AN INCREASE OF SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND ONGOING GENERAL FUND. FOR SUPPORTER PROJECT REBOUND THIS WOULD TAKE IT TO A TOTAL OF ONE MILLION DOLLARS TO PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR THOSE EXISTING PROGRAMS. KNOWING THAT THERE GRANT FUNDING IS RUNNING OUT A SORE INTENT IS TO PROVIDE TO A STABLE LEVEL OF FUNDING FOR THOSE PROGRAMS TO CONTINUE -- WE HAVE ALSO ADDED LANGUAGE AROUND THE TWO MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE CAMPUS STUDY IN SAN JOAQUIN LIKELY STOCKTON -- AND THEN LASTLY IN TERMS OF INVESTMENTS THERE IS A ONE TIME INVESTMENT OF SEVEN HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS TO SUPPORT. A FIRST STAR FOSTER YOUTH COHORT AT CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY SACRAMENTO. THIS IS A FOUR YEAR PROGRAM PER GENERALLY COHORT OF ROUGHLY THIRTY STUDENTS -- THEY MEET ONCE A MONTH IN THE SUMMER AS WELL AS EVERY SATURDAY -- HAS THE LA -- HIS NOTED IN THEIR ANALYSIS THERE HAVE BEEN POSITIVE RESULTS OF FOR FOSTER YOUTH THAT HAVE BEEN PARTICIPATING IN THAT PROGRAM. AND THEN THERE ARE TWO PIECES OF TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE -- THAT ARE RATHER CONFORMING TO PAST ACTIONS. OKAY MY COMMENTS ABOUT SEISMIC TO USE THE APPLY. TO THE ISSUE IS WELL I'D LIKE TO HAVE A AT SOME POINT GET AN IDEA. A HANDLE ON HOW MUCH WHAT WE NEED TO DO AND WHERE WE NEED TO DO IT AND IN WHAT TIME FRAME. FOR THE C. ISSUES AS WELL. OKAY NOW WE'RE READY FOR RELEASE. YOUR OWN SER RATE AND ALL SPEAK TO THE UC PROPOSALS FIRST AND THEN MY COLLEAGUE POSTING HOUSE AND WILL SPEAK TO THE CSU PROPOSALS. IF THAT'S HELPFUL TO THE COMMITTEE. FOR ON THE THE KEY YOU SEE PROPOSALS ON PAGE TWO OF YOUR AGENDA. AND ALL DISCUSS THE FIRST TWO PROPOSALS ON THAT THE THIRD PROPOSAL FOR RAPID RE HOUSING IS COMPARABLE TO A PROPOSAL FOR CS USE WITHOUT IT BE HELPFUL FOR YOU FOR THE CSU PORTION JUST. MENTION THAT ONE TIME TO TO SAY THE COMMITTEE SOMETIME THERE. ON THE FIRST PROPOSAL FOR A YOU SEE OUR P.. WE THINK THIS RAISES A FEW ISSUES FOR LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION. THE FIRST ISSUE IS A IS A RATHER BROAD ISSUE AND IT'S ISSUE THAT YOU FACE EACH YEAR AS OUR DECIDE DECIDING HOW TO ALLOCATE ONE TIME FUNDING TO ADDRESS THE STATE'S VARIOUS LIABILITIES. OTHER STATE FUNDS THREE DIFFERENT PENSION SYSTEMS CALPERS CAL STIRS AND USE YOUR P. AND THERE'S A BROAD QUESTION YOUR FACE BUT HOW TO PRIORITIZE FUNDING AMONG THOSE THREE SYSTEMS. WHAT APPROACH AVAILABLE TO THE LEGISLATURE COULD BE TO PRIORITIZE FUNDING? A TO CALPERS AND CAL STIRS FIRST. THE RATIONALE BEHIND THAT APPROACH WOULD BE THAT THE STATE DIRECTLY ADOPTION PENSION BENEFITS IN THE FUNDING POLICIES FOR THE SYSTEMS. I THOUGHT EITHER A CLEAR ROLE IN TERMS OF ADDRESSING THE REMAINING UNFUNDED LIABILITY. RESULTING FROM UNDER FUNDING THE PENSION SYSTEM BY CONTRAST I EASY THE UC REGENTS ADOPT THE PENSION BENEFITS. I'M IN THE FUNDING POLICY FOR YOU SEE OUR P. NO THAT'S SAID THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT STILL WANT. TO ADDRESS SOME COST PRESSURES THAT YOU SEE YOU MIGHT WANT TO PROVIDE SOME ONE TIME FUNDING TO ADDRESS THAT UNFUNDED PENSION LIABILITY. OUR SECOND CONSIDERATION IS THAT IF YOU IF THAT WAS THE GOAL OF THE LEGISLATURE WE RECOMMEND THAT YOU GET AN UNDERSTANDING OF THIS POTENTIAL SAVINGS RESULTING FROM THIS APPROPRIATION. OF THE LEGISLATURE AS OF YET HASN'T RECEIVED AN ESTIMATE OF THE ASSOCIATED SAVINGS OF PROVIDING THE ONE TIME FUNDING. THE THIRD CONSIDERATION IS IF YOU WERE TO PROVIDE FUNDING YOU COULD ALSO CONSIDER. A DOUBLE CHIN SOME SORT OF MATCH WITH UC'S NON STATE OF FUNDS SOURCES. THE REASON FOR THAT IS USE YOUR PIECE. ABOUT TEN BILLION DOLLAR UNFUNDED LABILITY IT REFLECTS THE LIABILITY ACROSS BOTH ITS CORE BUDGET AND ITS NON CORE BUDGET INCLUDING ITS MEDICAL CENTERS -- HOUSING AND DINING PROGRAMS. I'M INTO SOME SORT OF MATCH WOULD REFLECT THE THOSE NON STATE SOURCES ALSO SHARING AND CONTRIBUTING TO THEIR PORTION OF THE UNFUNDED LIABILITY -- BASED ON PAST CONVERSATIONS WE'VE HAD WE'VE HAD WITH YOU SEE WE THOUGHT AS A VERY ROUGH RULE OF THUMB. I WANTED A TWO DOLLAR MATCH EVERYONE DOLLAR GENERAL FUND COULD BE REASONABLE SO IF YOU WERE APPROPRIATE TWENTY FIVE MILLION. OF YOU CAN EXPECT A MATCH FROM THE UNIVERSITY ABOUT FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS BUT YOU COULD WORK WITH THE UNIVERSITY TO REFINE THAT OF MATCHING EXPECTATION MORE IF THAT WAS OF INTEREST TO THE COMMITTEE. KAMALA LET ME JUST MAKE SURE I GET THIS. SO WE'RE GOING. TO WE'RE GOING TO PAY DOWN SOME UNFUNDED LIABILITY YOU SEE RETIREMENT. THE UC RETIREMENT SYSTEM HAS SOME COMPONENTS ONE OF THE I GUESS THE FACULTY. THE STAFF ON THE THE NON HEALTH. CAMPUS CAMPUSES. AND THEN YOU HAVE FOLKS WHO ARE EMPLOYED ON THE HEALTH SIDE IF YOU SEE YOU SEE HELPS OF PHYSICIANS. NURSES ALLIED HEALTH PROFESSIONALS [inaudible] WIRE WHEEL. THE HEALTH SIDE OF THE UC. GENERATES A FIRM -- CASH FLOW MY RECOLLECTION. IS FROM SEVERAL YEARS AGO THE LAST TIME I SAW THE FINANCIALS FOR THE HEALTH SYSTEMS SITES. WHY ARE WE? DEALING WITH THE UNFUNDED LIABILITY FOR THE HEALTH SYSTEMS. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT IT IT CAN BE DIFFICULT TO UNTANGLE -- THE CORE NON CORE PORTION OF THE UNFUNDED LIABILITY. IN PAST YEARS WE'VE IT SOUNDS LIKE A AS A RUFFLE FROM ABOUT A THIRD. OF THE UNFUNDED LIABILITY COULD BE A SORT OF SO SEATED WITH THE CORE BUDGET. I'M I WISH I COULDN'T WE COULDN'T THINK OF ANOTHER MECHANISM THAT WOULD JUST ISOLATE THAT CORE PORTION OF THE UNFUNDED LIABILITY OTHER THAN SORT OF EXPECTING THAT MATCH THAT'S FOR THE MATCHING RECOMMENDATION COMES FROM -- BUT IN THE PAST YEARS THE STATE HASN'T EXPECTED THAT MATCH THOSE RESULTS THE STATE OF PROVIDED FOR EXAMPLE PROPOSITION TWO FUNDS TO HELP ADDRESS THE UNFUNDED LIABILITY. AND OUR UNDERSTANDING IS BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO ADDRESS THE UNFUNDED LIABILITY IN SOME TIRED IT'S BENEFITTED BOTH OF THE CORE AND NON CORE PORTIONS OF THE UNIVERSITY'S BUDGET. THAT'S A KEY QUESTION FOR YOU TO CONSIDER IS THERE A WAY THAT YOU CAN. I AM SURE THAT IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE CONTRIBUTING TO THE UNFUNDED LIABILITY THAT. UC'S NON STATE FUNDS ARE ALSO CONTRIBUTING TO THAT AND THAT'S WHERE THE MATCHING. A CONSIDERATION COMES FROM. I GUESS THE ALTERNATIVE WOULD BE TO HAVE THE HEALTH SYSTEMS. DUMP IN SOME MONEY TO PAY DOWN THE UNFUNDED LIABILITY FROM WITHIN YOU SEE. AND THAT AND THAT'S WHAT WORDS SUGGESTING YOU COULD CONSIDER IS HAVING SOME SORT OF MATCH TO THE TWENTY FIVE MILLION WELL I'M SURE. YOU SEEN AND I'LL HAVE SOME CONVERSATION IN A MINUTE BUT I MEAN JUST MAKE SURE HE'S HE'S FINISHED HE FINISHED. WE ALSO HAVE SOME THOUGHTS ON THE SECOND OF A BULLET POINT THERE ON PAGE TWO WHICH IS THE DYSLEXIA CENTER. WE THINK THEREFORE CONSIDERATIONS FOR THE LEGISLATURE. THE FIRST IS -- WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE PURPOSE OF THIS PILOT IS -- TO DEVELOP NEW WAYS TO TEST AND ADDRESS STUDENTS WHO HAVE -- DYSLEXIA AND OTHER FORMS OF LEARNING DISABILITIES THE PILOT WOULD BE AT A AT A AT A SELECT NUMBER OF SCHOOLS WITH THE ULTIMATE INTENTION OF ON LEARNING THE RESULTS OF THE PILOT AND THEN HOPEFULLY SCALING IT UP STATEWIDE TO THE EXTENT THAT THE PILOT IS SUCCESSFUL. THE FOUR CONSIDERATIONS WE HAVE WHAT WHAT ITS FIRST THAT -- WE RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE I WORK WITH THE MOST ADMINISTRATION TO UNDERSTAND HOW THIS PILOT WHEN INTERACT WITH THE STATE'S EXISTING SPECIAL EDUCATION INFRASTRUCTURE. INCLUDING THINGS LIKE SOFAS AND THE REAP REGIONAL DIAGNOSTIC CENTERS THAT ARE AVAILABLE SCHOOL DISTRICTS -- TO HELP IN THE TESTING AND AND EDUCATING OF STUDENTS WHO HAVE. LEARNING DISABILITIES. THE SECOND CONSIDERATION IS -- WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE -- WORK WITH ADMINISTRATION UNDERSTAND KIND OF THE ULTIMATE END GAME OF THE PILOTS OF THE GOOD FOR GOAL IS TO SCALE IT WHAT WOULD BE THE PLAN TO SCALE IT AND WOULD THAT ENTAIL ANY. ONGOING OR FUTURE COSTS ON THE ON THE STATE. THIRD OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THAT -- THIS UCSF CENTER HAS RAISED TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND PRIVATE PHILANTHROPY. AND SO IN ADDITIONAL QUICK CONSIDERATION IS WHETHER THOSE FUNDS COULD GO TO SUPPORT BY THIS AND OTHER ACTIVITIES THAT THAT CENTER HAS IN THE UP COMING FISCAL YEAR. AND IN FOURTH I IF THE LEGISLATURE WERE INTERESTED IN IN IN IN ADOPTING THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL WE ALSO RECOMMEND SOME REPORTING LANGUAGE BUT TO THE LEGISLATURE TO UNDERSTAND THE RESULTS OF THE PILOT. THANK YOU GOT IT. OKAY WHO'S NEXT. I THINK THAT WOULD BE ME SAY OVER TEN IN UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA -- WE'RE VERY PLEASED THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS -- RECOGNIZED UNIVERSITIES FUNDING NEEDS AND PROVIDED US WITH MORE FUNDING IN THE MAY REVISE -- IN REGARDS TO THE LA OWES RECOMMENDATION ON YOU SEE OUR P. I WOULD POINT OUT THAT IN -- EIGHTEEN NINETEEN THE UNIVERSITY IS DEPOSITING ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS IN TO USE THE RPG. FROM EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS OF WHICH FOUR HUNDRED NINETY MILLION COMES FROM CORE FUNDS SO THE HEALTH CENTERS ARE ALREADY PUTTING IN A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MONEY. IN READ THOSE NUMBERS AGAIN. THIS RUN BY THEM ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS FROM EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS. AND WAS FOUR HUNDRED NINETY MILLION FROM THE CORE CAMPUS SO THAT'S THE INSTRUCTIONAL SIDE WITH THE FACULTY AND STAFF WAS SERVED TO STUDENTS. NOW DO DOES ANY PORTION OF THAT CONSTITUTE A PAID OUT OF UNFUNDED LIABILITY OR IS THAT SIMPLY -- REQUIRED PENSION CONTRIBUTIONS APPROXIMATELY 6% OF THAT IS UNFUNDED LIABILITY PAY DOWN. I DON'T SORRY I DON'T HAVE MY CALCULATOR IN FRONT OF ME TO TELL YOU THAT 6% AS I'M IN A DISH AND THAT THOSE FUNDS WE ARE CURRENTLY PLANNING ANOTHER FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR CONTRIBUTION IN. NINETEEN TWENTY FROM STEP FUNDS STEP IS OUR SHORT TERM INVESTMENT POOL WHERE WE RECEIVE SOME INTEREST AND THOSE ARE GOING TO GO INTO UC RP TO PAY DOWN UNFUNDED LIABILITY. SO UNIVERSITY BELIEVES THAT WE ARE ALREADY OF PROVIDING A MATCH THROUGH DOT [inaudible] EXCELLENT. THANK YOU FOR THAT INFORMATION -- THREE MOVE ON TO THE RAPID RE HOUSING OR D. DYSLEXIA CENTER YOUR CHOICE MA'AM -- CHECK A LITTLE ISSUE TALK ME THROUGH IT. OKAY I'LL MOVE ON TO THE DYSLEXIA CENTER SINCE YOU HEARD THE HORN COVERED OF WE'RE WE'RE FINE WITH PROVIDING A REPORT. TO THE COMMITTEE OF WE DO BELIEVE THAT -- DYSLEXIA IS -- OF SPECIAL EDUCATION ISSUE THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED AND UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA HAS EXCELLENT FACULTY WHO CAN ASSIST THE IN CREATION OF THIS PILOT PROGRAM. TO CREATE OF METHODS FOR TEACHERS TO IDENTIFY A DYSLEXIC STUDENTS AND HELP THE STUDENTS EXCEL UNFORTUNATELY STUDENTS WITH DYSLEXIA ARE OFTEN -- THOUGHT OF BY TEACHER SOMETIMES AS LAZY OR STUPID BECAUSE THEY HAVE TROUBLE READING AND WRITING -- AND BY IDENTIFYING THOSE STUDENTS EARLY WE CAN HELP THEM EXCEL. SO ARMED WE WOULD REQUEST THAT YOU APPROVED THOSE FUNDS. ON THE RAPID RE HOUSING WE APPRECIATE THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS RECOGNIZED THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA'S NEED -- ARE MY LATEST STUDENTS SURVEY DID INDICATE THAT 5% OF OUR STUDENTS EXPERIENCE HOMELESSNESS SOMETIME DURING THE YEAR MANY OF THEM DURING THE WINTER BREAK AND SUMMER. OF 5% OF YOU SEE STUDENTS IS ABOUT FOURTEEN THOUSAND STUDENTS SO THERE IS A LOT OF NEED SO WE REQUEST THAT YOU APPROVED THESE FUNDS. THANK YOU THANK YOU. YES SIR. IF IT'S OKAY I WOULD LIKE TO JUST MAKE A QUICK CLARIFICATION ON THE USE YOUR P. ISSUE ONE AGAIN YES JUST ON THE OF FUNDING SOURCES THAT THE UNIVERSITY WALK THROUGH. WE JUST WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT AS THE UNIVERSITY NOTED -- IT'S FUNDING IT'S BOTH IT'S A EARNED BENEFITS EACH YEAR END OF THE UNFUNDED LIABILITY THROUGH TWO DIFFERENT WAYS THE FIRST OF THROUGH THE REGULAR. EMPLOYEE AN EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS OF WHICH IT SHARES BETWEEN CORE NON CORE FUNDING. BUT ALSO IS HAS BORROWING TO COVER THE REMAINDER OF THAT. SOME OF THE BORROWING HAS BEEN EXTERNAL BORROWING AND SOME OF THAT HAS BEEN INTERNAL BORROWING FROM IT'S FUN SOURCES. THE UNIVERSITY THEN PAYS THE ASSOCIATED DEBT FROM THAT BORROWING AGAIN SHARING. FROM ITS CORE AND NON CORE BUDGETS. AND SO ARE OUR POINT WAS ONLY THAT WE ALREADY HAVE A SYSTEM WHERE WE'RE SHARING THESE COSTS. IF THE LEGISLATURE'S INTERESTED AND PROVIDING ADDITIONAL FUNDING ON TOP OF THAT WOULD ALSO MAKE SENSE TO CONTINUE THAT SCHERING -- CONCEPT WITH THE WITH THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING. THANK YOU THANK YOU. DO WE COVER EVERYBODY AT THE TABLE. IN THIS ISSUE I MISSED YOU. YES SIR SO AUSTIN AS AND GET ON WITH LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE -- COMMENT ON THE RAPID RE HOUSING PROPOSAL WHICH CROSSES THE BOTH. IN FACT BOTH UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA AND CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY I CAN ALSO. MENTION THE THE FOSTER YOUTH. PROPOSED PROGRAM AT CSU WHICH IS ON PAGE FOUR OF YOUR AGENDA. SO THAT WITH REGARD TO THE RAPID RE HOUSING PROPOSALS PROPOSAL REYES RAISES SEVERAL ISSUES FOR LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION. RAPID RE HOUSING IS A WIDELY USED APPROACH FOR ADDRESSING HOMELESSNESS. AMONG. PLEASE VETERANS AND OTHER POPULATIONS. IT S THAT EXPENSIVE -- COSTLY MODEL. THAT'S SOMETHING TO KEEP IN MIND THE MODEL USUALLY ENTAILS HELPING TO PAY THE RENT. FOR CLIENTS AND PROVIDING A CASE MANAGER. A HIGH TOUCH -- CASE MANAGEMENT APPROACH SO IT IS EXPENSIVE IN THE PROPOSED LEVEL FUNDING. IN THE MAY REVISE LIKELY WOULD. THUS ONLY HELP A SMALL PROPORTION OF NEEDY STUDENTS AT UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AND CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY THE ASK IT COULD. SOMEBODY KEEP IN MIND IS A COULD CREATE SOME COST PRESSURES ON THE LEGISLATURE. TO INCREASE FUNDING YOU KNOW ANNUALLY TO ADDRESS THIS NEED. AS THE AGENDA NOTES AND THE COMMITTEE HAS HEARD IN HEARINGS EARLIER THIS SPRING -- THE ADMINISTRATION HAS A SEPARATE BASIC NEEDS. A PROPOSAL SET OF PROPOSALS FOR UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA AND CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY ITS ONGOING THIS PROPOSED FOR YOU SEE AND ONE TIME FOR CSU. SO SOMETHING ELSE FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO TO KEEP IN MIND WHEN IT. THINKING THROUGH THE RAPID RE HOUSING PROPOSAL IS [inaudible] HOW? THE PROPOSALS IN JANUARY AND THEN THIS NEW PROPOSAL IN MAY HOW THESE PROGRAMS WOULD INTERACT WHETHER YOU WOULD WANT TO BE SURE THAT THEY WOULD WORK IN A COHESIVE. COHERENT WAY AS OPPOSED TO KIND OF A SET A SILO TO APPROACH AND SO BETTER. UNDERSTANDING BEING REASSURED THAT THERE ARE THESE PROGRAMS ARE GOING TO WORK TOGETHER. GOING TO BE IMPORTANT FOR THE LEGISLATURE. IF THE LEGISLATURE DOES DECIDE. TO FIND. THE RAPID RE HOUSING. PROGRAM. LEGISLATURE'S GONNA NEED A LOT MORE INFORMATION CURRENTLY THERE'S JUST NOT MUCH LANGUAGE ON THIS PROPOSALS THE LEGISLATURE WANNA UNDERSTAND MUCH BETTER. WHAT EXACTLY IS MEANT BY RAPID RE HOUSING? HOW CAMPUSES WOULD BE SELECTED TO HAVE A PROGRAM HOW STUDENTS WOULD BE SELECTED HOW THE MONEY WOULD GO OUT? AND WHAT SORT OF A REPORTING OR OTHER OVERSIGHT WITH THE PROGRAM -- ENTAILS. WITH REGARD TO FOSTER USE THIS IS THE THIRD BULLET POINT ON PAGE FOUR OF YOUR AGENDA THIS FIRST OUR FOSTER YOUTH COHORT AT SACRAMENTO STATE UNIVERSITY LIKE. LIKE THE RAPID RE HOUSING PROPOSAL THIS MAY REVISED PROPOSAL. RAISES THE ISSUE ABOUT HOW MANY STUDENTS WOULD ACTUALLY BE SERVED -- AND IN THIS CASE IT WOULD JUST SERVE. THIRTY FOSTER YOUTH AND HIGH SCHOOLS. AND ONLY IN SACRAMENTO. KEEP IN MIND THAT THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF FOSTER YOUTH CURRENTLY IN HIGH SCHOOL IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY ALONE THERE'S ABOUT ONE THOUSAND FOSTER YOUTH CURRENTLY IN HIGH SCHOOL THIS WOULD AGAIN SERVE. THIRTY SO THE THE PROPOSAL RACES EQUITY QUESTIONS ABOUT STUDENTS WHO WOULD NOT BE ONE OF THE THIRTY CHOSEN -- AND STUDENTS WHO ARE INCLUDING STUDENTS WHO LIVE OUTSIDE OF SACRAMENTO COUNTY SACRAMENTO AREA. AND OF COURSE -- WERE THE LEGISLATURE WANT TO WANT TO EXPAND. FUNDING FOR THIS PROGRAM THERE COULD BE SOME OUT YOUR COSTS YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF ON GOING COSTS. AND COST TO EXPAND THE PROGRAM TO MEET THE NEEDS OF FOSTER YOUTH THROUGHOUT THE STATE. SO SOME SOME. ISSUES TO CONSIDER. WHEN LOOKING AT THESE MAY REVISED PROPOSALS? ANY COMMENT. THE WITH WHAT'S I GUESS ONE OF THE ISSUES IS WHAT'S THE GOAL IS IS A PILOT IS. THE PILOT PROGRAM OF THE STUDY TO BE EXPANDED OR WELL I'LL HAVE TO DEFER TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ON THAT AND I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE SOME. OVERARCHING COMMENTS ON BEHALF THIS ISSUE RIVER WAS TO GO FIRST IS FINE CERTAINLY SOLDIERS SO ON THE FIRST OUR FOSTER YOUTH COHORT I THINK WE'RE CERTAINLY TARGETING -- SACRAMENTO STATE WE ARE WHERE THAT CSU SAN BERNADINO DOES OPERATE ONE OF THESE PROGRAMS TODAY -- SO WERE WERE LOOKING AT IT AS A ONE TIME INVESTMENT FOR ONE COHORT -- I THINK WE'RE CERTAINLY OPEN TO LOOKING OF WHAT THE OUTCOMES OF THAT COHORT OR BUT IT IS VERY FOCUSED ON JUST THE ONE UNIVERSITY AT THIS TIME HOW TO SIMMER TO HAVE A SIM READINESS PROGRAM FUNDED. I THINK WE'RE STILL OUT LOOKING. WE'RE STILL -- INVESTIGATING HOW THAT PROGRAM IS FUNDED AT THIS TIME -- I DON'T KNOW -- BUT WE CAN CERTAINLY GET BACK YOUR STAFF WITH THE CENTER ROUGHLY. I THINK I CAN ANSWER THAT QUESTION I HAD A CONVERSATION LATE LAST WEEK WITH. A STAFF AT FIRST STAR WHICH IS LOCATED IN LOS ANGELES AND COURT IN THAT STAFF PERSON. THE SALMON A DINO CAMPUSES CAMPUS RECEIVES MONEY FROM THE LOCAL LOCAL COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION AND ALSO RECEIVES SOME PRIVATE MONEY. PHILANTHROPIC MONEY THROUGH THE FOUNDATION PROBABLY. THEY GET AMBERG FOUNDATIONS WHAT I HEARD. YES SIR WELL THANK YOU AGAIN FOR ALLOWING ME TO COME TO YOUR SUBCOMMITTEE AND PROVIDE SOME COMMENT ON BEHALF OF THIS ISSUE MY NAME AGAIN IS RAINSTORM -- FIRST I WANT TO POINT OUT WE'RE WILL BURKE VERY GRATEFUL TO THE ADMINISTRATION FOR STICKING WITH THEIR JANUARY PROPOSAL OF A PROVIDING A LOT OF FUNDING CORE FUNDING FOR THE UNIVERSITY TO COVER COMPENSATION -- PORTIONS OF OUR GRADUATION ISSUED IF INCREASED ACCESS THOSE SORTS BY INJURY PORTION OF THAT TOO WE'RE ALSO VERY APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS KEENLY AWARE THAT ARTS. MANY OF OUR STUDENTS HAVE SOME PRETTY SIGNIFICANT NEEDS. I THAT TRANSCEND JUST THE EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM THAT THAT'S THEIR LIVING AND THEIR LIVING. CONDITIONS AND LIVING EXPENSES THAT ARE THAT ARE ALSO A CHALLENGE TO MANY OF OUR STUDENTS. I THINK GENERALLY SPEAKING -- ONE OF THE THINGS I WANT TO LEAVE AN IMPRESSION WITH WITH THE COMMITTEE AND AND I STRESS THIS ABOUT A MONTH AGO. WAS THE FACT THAT -- FROM THE CITY'S PERSPECTIVE OUR OUR FIRST AND FOREMOST CALISTA FUNDED THE BALANCE OF OUR GRADUATION INITIATIVE. THERE'S A NEED FOR ANOTHER THIRTY MILLION OLLARS FOR THAT INITIATIVE I THINK IF THAT'S FULLY FUNDED. WE WILL BE ABLE TO OFFER AN ADDITIONAL COURSE TO AS MANY AS NINETY THOUSAND DIGITAL STUDENTS AND THAT'S THAT THAT'S THE GOAL IS TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL ACCESS TO OUR CURRENT STUDENTS. ON TOP OF THAT THERE'S ALSO THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADD TO THE TO THE GLOBAL AMOUNT AGREES THAT THE CAL THAT CALIFORNIA. IS ANTICIPATED TO NEED IN THE NEAR FUTURE RIGHT OUR OUR ECONOMY CONTINUES TO GO TOWARDS NEEDING GROWING TOARDS A NEED FOR ADDITIONAL HIGHER. I DEGREES OF EDUCATION AND OUR GOAL IS -- TO INSURE GREATER ACCESS TO FUTURE STUDENTS ARE PROSPECTIVE STUDENTS SO WHAT IT COMES DOWN TO THESE PROPOSES I THINK WHAT WILL WHAT WE WE WOULD SAY GENERALLY SPEAKING IS IS THAT OUR PRIORITY WOULD BE FOR OUR CORE REQUEST. THESE ARE IMPORTANT ISSUES THAT WE WANT TO ADDRESS OBVIOUSLY BUT WE DO RECOGNIZE THAT SOME OF THE CONCERNS RAISED BY THE LA -- WHERE IF THERE IS THE DESIRE TO ESTABLISH SOME OF THESE PROGRAMS? THERE WILL BE THAT A COME KIND OF A COMPLETE A COMPETITION FOR LIMITED GENERAL FUND DOLLARS -- FOR NOT ONLY THE EDUCATIONAL COMPONENT OUR CORE MISSION AS A AS A UNIVERSITY BUT THEN ALSO AT ADDING ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR A NUMBER OF THESE STUDENTS SUPPORTIVE SERVICES -- AND WITH THAT I THINK THAT'S THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO SAY ABOUT THE MI REVISION THANK YOU. WELL LET ME JUST SAY -- IT WAS NOT LOST ON SOME OF US WHAT WAS NOT IN THE MAY REVISION. AND IT'S A MATTER OF OF BALANCING PRIORITIES THE LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES VERSUS THE ADMINISTRATION'S PRIORITIES AND AS BERMAN FINANCE KNOWS WELL WE WILL SORT ALL THAT OUT IN THE NEXT -- WEEK OR TWO CERTAINLY UNIFYING HANDED THOSE PRIORITIES I JUST WANT TO REITERATE ON THE CSU SAN JOAQUIN STUDY THAT'S A HIGH PRIORITY OF THE ADMINISTRATION [inaudible] NOTED. ANYTHING ELSE ON ISSUE NUMBER ONE BEFORE WE MOVE ON I DON'T WANT TO LEAVE ANYBODY OUT EVERYBODY GETS TO TALK OKAY. THAT'S ISSUE NUMBER ONE LET'S GO TO ISSUE NUMBER.

WHO WANTS TO START? GO AHEAD AND GET OFF HERE A GOOD MORNING. MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS -- GOING TO PROVIDE YOU JUST WITH A A PRETTY BRIEF OVERVIEW. OF THE CALCULATION OF THE PROPOSITION NINETY MINIMUM GUARANTEE AT THE MAYOR VISION AND SOME OF THE MAJOR -- K. THROUGH FOURTEEN SPENDING PROPOSALS ARE WITHIN. ARE. THOSE FOR THE CALCULATION GUARANTEE IS CONCERNED THE MAY REVISION PROPOSES -- AS YOU PROBABLY HAVE HEARD THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF FUNDING EVER UNDER THE PROP NINETY EIGHT MINIMUM GUARANTEE. AT EIGHTY ONE POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS UP FROM ABOUT EIGHTY POINT SEVEN AT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AND THEN UP FROM SEVENTY EIGHT POINT ONE BILLION NOW -- IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN AND OF COURSE UP FROM ALL THE WAY UP FROM FORTY SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS DURING THE TROUGH OF THE RECESSION. I WOULD CONTINUE REVENUE GROWTH DURING THE RECOVERY COMING OUT OF THE GREAT RECESSION TOTAL GENERAL FUND REVENUES NOW THE MAYOR VISION ARE ESTIMATED TO BE. AT ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS IN TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY AN INCREASE OF MORE THAN FIVE BILLION DOLLARS OVER THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN REVENUES. A TOTAL HAS A SET OF EIGHTY ONE POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN THE GUARANTEE THAT'S A PER PUPIL EXPENDITURE FROM PROP NINETY EIGHT OF JUST UNDER TWELVE THOUSAND DOLLARS PER PUPIL AN INCREASE OF ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR PEOPLE OVER THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN LEVELS. COMPARED TO THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET FUNDING AND WE GUARANTEE IS UP ALMOST SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS OVER. THE THREE YEAR PERIOD. WITH FACTOR CHANGES AT THE MAYOR VISION MOST NOTABLY A DECREASE AND PER CAPITA PERSONAL INCOME IN. TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY THE MINIMUM GUARANTEE WILL ALSO NOW INCLUDE IN THE BUDGET YEAR. A DEPOSIT INTO THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM STABILIZATION ACCOUNT OR THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT RAINY DAY RESERVE. OF THREE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY NINE POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS AS REQUIRED. PER THE CONSTITUTIONAL LANGUAGE OF PROPOSITION. TWO ON ALSO SIMILAR TO THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET K. FOURTEEN EDUCATION WILL NOT EXPERIENCE A REDUCTION IN PRIOR CURRENT YEAR. APPROPRIATIONS DESPITE DECLINES IN THE MID MINIMUM GUARANTEE CALCULATIONS COMPARED TO THE pBECAUSE WE ARE PROPOSING TO CONTINUE A MAINTENANCE OFAN OVER PERFORATION IN THE PRIOR YEAR. IT WAS FORTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS NOW HUNDRED AND SEVENTEEN MILLION DOLLARS IN THE PRIOR YEAR OF AN OVER PREPARATION -- AND THEN ALSO CONTINUING YOU SETTLE UP IN THE CURRENT YEAR TO OFFSET -- OTHERWISE SO UNFUNDED TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN OBLIGATIONS FOR ONGOING PROGRAMS -- IN THIS CASE -- THE LC FF IN -- TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN SOME OF THE MAJOR SPENDING PROPOSAL CHANGES ON CAPITOL GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IS THAT AS YOU'VE PROBABLY HEARD A COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT IS DOWN FROM THREE POINT. FOUR SIX IN NINETEEN TWENTY TWO THREE POINT 26% -- SO THE MAYOR IS AN IS STILL -- CONTINUE TO PRIORITIZE FUNDING ON A DEAL CFF BUT WITH THAT -- CHANGE -- THE INCREASE TO THE LCF OVER NINETEEN KIRK'S USE ME OVER EIGHTEEN NINETEEN A COMES ON TO JUST OVER ONE POINT NINE BILLION DOLLARS AS COMPARED TO TWO BILLION DOLLARS AT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET -- BUT STILL BRINGS THE TOTAL INCREASE FUNDING -- SENSING A CONVULSIVE FAST -- TOO JUST ABOUT SIXTY THREE BILLION DOLLARS WHICH IS THE SAME AS WAS PROJECTED UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. THE REVISION ALSO BUILDS UPON THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION BY INCREASING FUNDING FOR THAT PROGRAM -- BY OVER ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS COMPARED TO THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AND USING NOW ONLY ON GOING FUNDS FOR THIS PURPOSE WHICH WOULD BRING THE TOTAL OF FUNDING FOR THE PROPOSAL TO SIX HUNDRED NINETY SIX MILLION DOLLARS [inaudible] THE SO INCLUDING LC THEFT THE THE DECREASE ATTRIBUTABLE TO COST OF LIVING -- FOR CASUAL PROGRAMS -- AT THE MAY REVISION IS ROUGHLY SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS SO THE BULK OF THAT IS THE DECREASE IN LCF -- BRIEFLY FOR THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES -- THE MAYOR VIEWS IT MAIN PROVISION PROPOSES THIRTY NINE POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS AND ONE TIME PROP NINETY EIGHT FUNDS FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE -- ALSO CONTINUES TO FUND THE COMMUNICATIVE STRONG WORK FORCE PROGRAM AT ITS CURRENT FUNDING LEVEL OF TWO HUNDRED FORTY MILLION DOLLARS -- WITH ALMOST ALL OF IT THIS TIME -- BEING FUNDED FROM ONGOING FUNDS AS COMPARED TO A MIX OF ONE TIME AN ON GOING AS WAS THE CASE IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET -- AND THEN SIMILARLY TO THE K. TWELVE SIDE COMMUNITY COLLEGES. WE ARE ALSO PROPOSING A DECREASE THEIR OF TWENTY POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS FROM NINETY TO REFLECT THE DECREASE IN COST OF LIVING. SOME BRIEF OF MAJOR K. -- FOURTEEN NON PROPOSITION. NINETY EIGHT FUNDING PROPOSALS THAT I WANT TO MENTION JUST KIND OF IN RECOGNITION OF LIMITED GROWTH THAT WE ARE EXPERIENCING GUARANTEE. PARTICULARLY WITH THE DEPOSIT INTO THE RAINY DAY RESERVE THE MID THE MAYOR VISION PROPOSES THESE FOLLOWING -- PROGRAMS AND AUGMENTATIONS. ARE YOU MAY REMEMBER THAT AT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WE HAD A THREE BILLION DOLLAR A PROPOSAL FOR THE CAL STIRS EMPLOYER SHARE CONTRIBUTION RATE -- WE ARE NOW PROPOSING AN ADDITIONAL HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS ESTIMATED -- IN TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY TO BRING THE EMPLOYER SHARE CONTRIBUTION RATE IN NINETEEN TWENTY FROM -- EIGHTEEN POINT 1% DOWN ALL THE WAY TO SIXTEEN POINT 7% SO IT GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WAS ABOUT A 1% DECREASE AND NOW WE ARE PROJECTING IT WILL BE A ONE POINT 4%. A DECREASE IN NINETEEN TWENTY ONLY. OF AND THEN -- ALL AS WELL A IN AN EFFORT -- TO FURTHER TARGET THE FUNDS CONTAINED WITHIN THE KINDERGARTEN FACILITIES -- FUNDING PROPOSAL AT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET -- WE'RE PROPOSING PRODUCE -- THAT FUNDING FROM SEVEN AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS DOWN TO SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. AND LASTLY -- JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT TEACHER WORK FORCE OF THE MAYOR VISION ALSO INCLUDES A HUNDRED AND FORTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS IN TEACHER WORKFORCE INVESTMENTS FOR VOTE. NEW TEACHERS AT SCHOOLS WITH A HIGH NUMBER OF TEACHERS SERVING ON EMERGENCY PERMITS. PROVIDE STATEWIDE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT FOR TEACHERS ON SOCIAL EMOTIONAL LEARNING. INCLUSIVE PRACTICES AND SUBJECT MATTER CONFIDENCE IN COMPUTER SCIENCE AND ALSO PROVIDE STATEWIDE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT FOR SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS AND OTHER SCHOOL LEADERS HOW WOULD THAT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS OR QUALITY MY COLLEAGUES. FOR MORE DETAILED QUESTIONS [inaudible] WELL. I DON'T KNOW IF. YOU'RE THE RIGHT PERSON TO DIRECT THIS TO BUT WITH REGARD TO THE SPECIAL EDUCATION PROPOSAL. THE I. S. THIS BEFORE WHEN WE HAD THE GENERAL HEARING ON THE SUBJECT. BUT WHAT IS THE RIGHT WHAT WAS THE RATIONALE. TO BECAUSE THE PROGRAM TO BE DESIGNED AROUND A CONCENTRATION GRANT FORMULA FOR EXAMPLE MORE THAN 55% -- FREE AND REDUCED LUNCH FOSTER KIDS ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS GIVEN THE FACT THAT. SPECIAL EDUCATION STUDENTS WITH SPECIAL NEEDS ARE SPREAD THROUGHOUT DISTRICTS AROUND THE STATE REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY HAVE 55% OR NOT. AND DOESN'T THAT CREATE A SYSTEM OF WINNERS AND LOSERS AND ARE WE DEAL WITH. RIGHT I THINK THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION SHOVEL DO DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE -- SO THE FUNDING IS GOING TO LIKE YOU MENTIONED RIGHT FOCUS ON SCHOOLS WITH OVER TO THE SUPPLEMENTAL CONCENTRATION GRAN AND NOW CFF -- AND IT WAS HARD IT THIS WAY BECAUSE THE ADMINISTRATION IS REALLY FOCUSED ON LOOKING AT AT THE COMPOUNDING EFFECTS OF POVERTY RIGHT -- POVERTY IMPACTS SO MANY ASPECTS OF A PERSON'S LIFE IN OF A OF A CHILD'S LIFE AND SO THE FUNDING IS GOING ON IN THIS WAY TO FOCUS ON KIND OF AREAS OF NEED IN THE STATE TO HAVE THESE HIGH RATES OF STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES AND SPECIAL NEEDS. AND ALSO HIGH RATES OF STUDENTS WITH OTHER NEEDS SUCH AS LIVING IN POVERTY AND IN YOU KNOW IN FOSTER CARE -- AND SO IT'S JUST AT  DIFFERENT WAY TO KIND OF TARGET ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR ADDITIONAL SERVICES TO TARGET AND I GUESS WE'LL HAVE TO DEAL WITH THIS IS WE GRAPPLE WITH DIFFERENCES IN THE BUDGET. TO TRY TO RECONCILE THINGS BUT I'M HAVING DIFFICULTY -- IT'S ONE LET YOU ALL KNOW CONNECTING POVERTY WAS WITH THE SPECIAL NEEDS AND THE SPECIAL EDUCATION STUDENTS IN THE SPECIAL NEEDS THAT THEY HAVE AND HOW TO DEAL WITH -- SO I'M I'M REALLY HAVING A DIFFICULT TIME I MEAN IF WE'RE TRYING TO RELIEVE POVERTY THERE OTHER PROGRAMS TO DO THAT I WOULD THINK IN THIS. ONE SEEMS TO BE TARGETED TOWARD DRIVING MORE MONEY TO DOWN TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND INTO CLASSROOMS TO HELP. EDUCATE THOSE IN SOME CASES WAS VERY VERY DIFFICULT. TO DEAL WITH SPECIAL NEEDS AND I DON'T SEE HOW. I AM HAVING TROUBLE MAKING THE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE SCHOOL WITH. 56% FOR ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS FREE AND REDUCED LUNCH FOSTER KIDS AND AND THE SCHOOL WAS 46%. ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS FREE REDUCE LUNCHEON FOSTER KIDS AND HOW THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE IN TERMS OF WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH SPECIAL ED MONEY BUT THAT'S A COMMENT THAT'S NOT A QUESTION. I'LL DROP IT. OKAY WHO'S NEXT -- I'M SORRY. ZERO CAN I JUST ASK UP. THE LA L. TWO WAY AND AND HELP BRIDGE THAT IF YOU WOULD -- YES WILL QUOTE HE DIDN'T ASK THE QUESTION BUT I I AM I I NEED YOU TO HELP BRIDGE IF YOU WOULD IS IT ALRIGHT IF WE COVER THAT IN OUR PRESENTATION WE DO HAVE SOME SPECIFIC THOUGHTS ON THAT OKAY. NO THAT DERAILED A TRAIN LET'S PUT. NEXT I DON'T REMEMBER AND THANK YOU AND GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS KENNETH COUPON WITH THE GENTLEST OFFICE I'LL BE SPEAKING FROM A HANDOUT THAT THE SERGEANT I JUST DISTRIBUTED. I THINK MICHAEL TO GET THE ADMINISTRATION GIVE YOU A GOOD OVERVIEW OF THIS MAN A REVISION. OF THE WAY WE THINK ABOUT IT THERE ARE REALLY THREE KEY NUMBERS TO KIND OF TELL THE TALE OF OF THE BUDGET FOR YOU. I TURNING TO PAGE ONE OF OUR HAND OUT THE FIRST IS SEVEN HUNDRED AND FORTY SIX MILLION. THAT'S THE TOTAL INCREASE IN THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT MINIMUM GUARANTEE ACROSS THE THREE BUDGET YEARS THAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN TO NINETEEN TWENTY AND SO THAT KIND OF TELLS YOU HOW MUCH. NEW FUNDING IS POTENTIALLY ON THE TABLE FOR THINGS AND PRIORITIES THAT YOU MIGHT CARE ABOUT. MOST OF THAT INCREASE IS ASSOCIATED WITH EIGHTEEN NINETEEN AND NINETEEN TWENTY AND IT'S RESULT OF THE INCREASE IN REVENUE ESTIMATES -- AFTER THE STATE BUDGET YOU PROBABLY ALL KNOW THAT APRIL WAS A PRETTY GOOD MONTHS -- FOR A STATE TAX COLLECTIONS -- TURNING TO PAGE TWO I THINK THE OTHER NEXT KEY NUMBER IS THREE HUNDRED AND THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY NINE MILLION THAT'S THE SIZE OF THIS DEPOSIT. INTO THE STATE'S PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT RESERVE I THIS ISN'T SOMETHING WHERE THE ADMINISTRATION SORT OF LOOKS AT EVERYTHING AND JUST PICKS A NUMBER THERE'S A VERY SPECIFIC SET OF CONSTITUTIONAL FORMULAS THAT DETERMINE. THE DEPOSIT. THEY'RE ALMOST AS COMPLICATED AS PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT ITSELF -- BUT THE KEY THINGS THAT REALLY TRIGGERED A DEPOSIT ARE THE STATE ARE RECEIVING CAPITAL GAINS ABOVE THE LONG TERM AVERAGE OF ABOUT 8% OF GENERAL FUND REVENUE. AND THEN THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT MINIMUM GARRETT HE ITSELF A GROWING MY QUICKLY ARE BEING ABOVE THE PRIOR YEAR FUNDING LEVEL ADJUSTED FOR CHANGES IN STUDENT ATTENDANCE AND INFLATION FACTOR. AND SO THAT THREE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY NINE DEPOSIT ACCOUNTS FOR ABOUT HALF OF THE SEVEN HUNDRED AND FORTY SIX MILLION IN NEW FUNDING THAT -- IS ASSOCIATED WITH GROWTH AND A GUARANTEE. AND THEN THE FINAL NUMBER REALLY GETS TO THE PROGRAM A COMPONENT OF THE OF THE ME REVISION. THIS WITH A BUDGET HAS A HUNDRED NINETEEN MILLION IN ADDITIONAL FUNDING. BEYOND THE GOVERNOR'S JANUARY BUDGET. FOR THE SPECIAL EDUCATION CONCENTRATION GRANT PROPOSAL AS YOU HEARD IT ALSO MAKES ALL THAT FUNDING ON GOING INSTEAD OF RELYING ON A MIX OF ONE TIME AND I'M GOING FUNDS. ARE THE TWO MOST NOTABLE PROPOSALS OUTSIDE OF PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT YOU ALREADY HEARD A LITTLE BIT ABOUT. THAT PROPOSAL FOR ADDITIONAL PENSION RATE RELIEF IN NINETEEN TWENTY THE OTHER PROPOSAL I THINK WE WOULD HIGHLIGHT IS THE I CHANGED TO THE KINDERGARTEN FACILITY GRANT. THE GOVERNOR HAS A PROPOSAL TO TARGET THOSE GRANTS A LITTLE BIT MORE NARROWLY SPECIFICALLY ON DISTRICTS THAT ARE TRYING TO CONVERT PART TAKEN A GARDEN PROGRAMS THE FULL DAY PROGRAMS. HE'S ALSO PROPOSING A LITTLE BIT OF A SMALLER -- ALLOTMENT FOR THAT PROGRAM DOWN FROM SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION IN JANUARY TO SIX HUNDRED MILLION. UNDER THE MADE THE DECISION. I PAGE THREE OF OUR HAND OUT IS REALLY JUST A OVER JUST AN OVERVIEW OF ALL OF THE SPECIFIC SPENDING PROPOSALS I'LL BE TALKING A LOT MORE ABOUT THOSE AND OVER THE NEXT WEEK OR TWO SO I WON'T GET INTO THAT LEVEL OF DETAIL HERE. I TURNING TO PAGE FOUR WE THINK. THIS MAY REVISION HAS A NUMBER OF POSITIVE ELEMENTS. WHEN WE LOOK AT ANALYZING? A PROPOSAL LIKE THIS W ALWAYS HAVE TO START WITH THE ESTIMATES OF THE MINIMUM GUARANTEE. AND THOSE ARE DRIVEN -- HAVE A LOT TO DO WITH WITH WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH STATE GENERAL FUND REVENUE. I REVENUE ESTIMATES THIS YEAR ARE VERY CLOSE TOGETHER -- IN TERMS OF THE REVENUE THAT AFFECTS THE GUARANTEE I THINK WE'RE ABOUT TWO HUNDRED MILLION OR SO BELOW THE ADMINISTRATION SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN FOUR HUNDRED MILLION PER YEAR ABOUT THE ADMINISTRATION AND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN NINETEEN TWENTY BY. ANY SORT OF HISTORICAL STANDARD THAT'S A VERY CLOSE TOGETHER. MOST OF THE DIFFERENCES IN OUR ESTIMATES HAVE TO DO WITH -- OUR OUTLOOK BEING COMPLETED JUST A LITTLE BIT LATER WE A LITTLE BIT BETTER -- MORE UPDATED DATA THAN THE ADMINISTRATION. I WOULD ALSO JUST HAVE DIFFERENT WAYS OF MODELING -- THE AFFECTS OF INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINGS OF CALIFORNIA COMPANIES. YOU PROBABLY KNOW THIS BUT A PRETTY HOT TOPIC LATELY AND THAT'S HAS A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON SOME OF THE REVENUE ESTIMATES THAT WE HAVE. ALSO ACROSS THE SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN TO NINETEEN TWENTY PERIOD OUR ESTIMATES OF THE MINIMUM GUARANTEE ARE ONLY TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION. ABOVE THE ADMINISTRATION'S ESTIMATE SO JUST A VERY SMALL FRACTION OF THE FUNDING THAT SCHOOLS ARE ARE ARE RECEIVING. WE THINK THE FOR MAKING THE FIRST DEPOSIT INTO THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT RESERVE IS A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENT -- GIVEN ALL OF THE COMPLEX CALCULATIONS WE LOOK PRETTY CLOSELY AT THE NUMBERS TO THE ADMINISTRATION PUT FORWARD. AND WE THINK THAT THEY BUT FROM AND CONSISTENT WITH THE INTENT TO PROPOSITION. TWO FOR THE FIRST TIME AT THE STATE WILL REALLY HAVE IT SORT OF A DEDICATED SOURCE OF FUNDING -- TO HELP SCHOOLS GET THROUGH THE NEXT SORT OF SLOW DOWN OUR ECONOMIC RECESSION -- BEYOND JUST SORT OF GENERAL PURPOSE RESERVES ELSEWHERE IN THE STATE BUDGET THESE THIS OP PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT RESERVISTS REALLY SPECIFICALLY TO HELP SMOOTH OUT SOME OF THAT VOLATILITY FOR SCHOOLS. ALSO I THINK COMPLIMENTS SOME OF THE OTHER EFFORTS YOU MAKING TO TRY -- TO BUT THE STATE BUDGET AND EVEN MORE FIRM FOOTING. AT IN TERMS OF THE MIX OF ONE TIME AN ONGOING PROPOSALS WE THINK THIS MAKE THE VISION IS GENERALLY MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. AT THE GOVERNOR'S JANUARY BUDGET ACTUALLY PROPOSED SPENDING ABOUT EIGHTY MILLION MORE ON ON GOING PROGRAMS AND IT HAD AVAILABLE AND I'M GOING RESOURCES SO THAT FELT A LITTLE BIT OF A DEFICIT INTO THE BUDGET. FOR THE NEXT YEAR OTHER MAJOR REVISION ELIMINATES THAT DEFICIT STILL RELIES ON SOME. ONE TIME FUNDS TO PAY FOR ONGOING COSTS BUT IT ALSO HAS SETS ASIDE SOME OTHER MONEY FOR THINGS THAT AREN'T ON GOING. AND SO KIND OF TAKING ALL THOSE FACTORS TOGETHER IT ACTUALLY HAS A SMALL SURPLUS OF KIND OF STRUCTURAL IS WHAT WE THINK OF AS A STRUCTURAL SURPLUS OF ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION ON AN ONGOING BASIS -- FINALLY ON THAT CAN OCCUR IN FACILITY GRANT WE THINK THAT IS ALSO A POSITIVE STEP -- THE CHANGES. THAT ARE IN THE MAY REVISION I THINK WE'LL GET THE PROGRAM -- WHAT CLOSELY ALIGNED WITH THE CORE OBJECTIVE YOU SET FORTH WHICH WAS TO ENCOURAGE MORE FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN PROGRAMS? COULD ALSO ENCOURAGE MORE LOW INCOME DISTRICTS TO APPLY GIVEN THAT THE GOVERNOR WANTS A LITTLE BIT MORE OF THAT MATCH THE LOCAL MATCH TO BE A LITTLE BIT LESS THAN THE STATE TO PICK UP A LITTLE BIT MORE OF THE COST. WE STILL THINK THAT DEMAND FOR THE PROGRAM PROBABLY WILL BE LESS THAN SIX HUNDRED MILLION AND SO IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR WAYS TO FREE UP FUNDING FOR SOME OF YOUR OTHER PRIORITIES -- LOWERING THAT AMOUNT WOULD BE A WE THINK OF VERY REASONABLE PLACE TO START. I FINALLY TURNING TO PAGE FIVE OF HIGHLIGHT JUST TO CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE WITH THE MAJOR VERSION. THE FIRST IS THAT THE REALLY THE THE BUDGET QUESTION. STILL REMAINS VERY SMALL -- BY TYPICALLY. OVER THE PAST SIX YEARS FOR EXAMPLE THE STATE SET ASIDE ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION KIND OF AN ONGOING FUNDS FOR ONE TIME ACTIVITIES. AND THAT GIVES YOU A GOOD BUDGET CUSHION IN CASE THE MINIMUM GUARANTEE DECLINES OR SOMETHING HAPPENS NEXT YEAR THOSE ONE TIMES FUNDS JUST EXPIRE YOU DON'T HAVE TO MAKE. REDUCTIONS IN ONGOING PROGRAMS. AT THE GOT THE MAY REVISION HAS A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION IN KIND OF A A ONE TIME QUESTION. BUT THAT'S THAT'S VERY SMALL ESPECIALLY IN THE CONTEXT OF THE TYPE OF DOWNTURN RECESSION THE STATE MY EXPERIENCE -- IN THE NEXT COUPLE YEARS AND SO AS YOU START THINKING ABOUT ALL OF THESE SORT OF SPECIFIC SPENDING PROPOSALS. I WOULD RECOMMEND YOU THINK ABOUT SHIFTING EVEN MORE FUNDING TO ONE TIME ACTIVITIES A LITTLE BIT LESS ON ON GOING PROGRAMS. AND THEN FINALLY I'LL SPEAK TO THE SPECIAL EDUCATION PROPOSAL I KNOW THAT'S A PRETTY HOT TOPIC THIS YEAR -- WE HAD WE SHARE SOME OF THE CONCERNS I THINK THAT YOU REYES MISTER CHAIR -- AND THE WAY I THINK WE ARTICULATED IS THAT THIS. PROPOSAL -- IS ONE WHERE -- THE WE THINK THE FISCAL INCENTIVES ARE REALLY -- WORKING -- VERY MUCH AT ODDS WITH THE INTENT OF THE PROGRAM -- THE I THINK THE GOAL OF THE SPECIAL EDUCATION GRANT WAS TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS WERE IDENTIFIED FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION SERVICES WHO NEED EXTRA SUPPORT. BUT BY TYING THE FUNDING TO THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS WRITE DOWN A FIDE. THE STATE WOULD EFFECTIVELY PENALIZE DISTRICTS THAT ARE SUCCESSFUL IN REDUCING IDENTIFICATION RATES AND REWARD THOSE TO KEEP IDENTIFICATION RATES HIGH. AND WE'RE NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT SMALL POTATOES HERE THE ON THE MARGIN THE AMOUNT FOR PER STUDENT WOULD BE MORE THAN TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS AND SO THAT IS GOING TO WE THINK WE'LL HAVE A PRETTY STRONG AFFECTING HOW DISTRICTS THINK ABOUT SPECIAL EDUCATION AND HOW MANY STUDENTS TO IDENTIFY. WE THINK YOU HAVE SOME BETTER ALTERNATIVES STACK YOU COULD DO IN PLACE OF THIS PROPOSAL. ONE WOULD BE TO EQUALIZING SPECIAL EDUCATION FUNDING WE THINK THAT COULD. I PROVIDE DISTRIBUTE FUNDING MORE BROADLY ADDRESS SOME OF THE HISTORICAL INEQUITIES THAT YOU'VE BEEN CONCERNED ABOUT IN THE PAST. WE ALSO THINK YOU COULD THINK ABOUT HAVING A PROGRAM SPECIFICALLY FOCUSED ON AT A PRESCHOOL. SPECIAL EDUCATION CURRENTLY THE STATE DOESN'T PROVIDE ANY DEDICATED FUNDING FOR THAT EVEN THOUGH DISTRICTS ARE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE IT. I WE THINK A SMALLER MORE TARGETED PROGRAM COULD ADDRESS SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS IDENTIFIED AND YOU MIGHT HAVE IN THAT AREA. SO WITH THAT LET ME TURN THINGS THINGS OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE FOR A QUICK RUN. ON THE PRESCHOOL AND CHILDCARE SAID THE BUDGET BUT BEFORE WE DO THAT I MEAN. MY CONCERN WITH THE SPECIAL ED. PROPOSAL MAYBE PERHAPS I COULD BECOME CONCERNED ABOUT THE MONEY BEING DRIVEN TO ELEAZAR WITH MORE THAN THE STATEWIDE AVERAGE SURE OF STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES. BUT YOU'RE LEAST DRIVING THE MONEY DOWN. TWO STUDENTS WITH SPECIAL NEEDS MY CONCERN IS THIS REDUCED LUNCH ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS. FOSTER KIDS I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT HAS TO DO. THE SPECIAL EDUCATION AND SPECIAL NEEDS. DO YOU. I THINK THAT MIGHT BE ANOTHER REASON WHY I WOULD SWITCH SUGGEST WE RECOMMEND YOU REJECT THIS PROPOSAL -- THEY'RE JUST WAITING BETTER WAYS TO TARGET. THE MONEY THIS DOESN'T REALLY WE THINK GET AT KIND OF THE QUICK CONCERNS THAT THE GOVERNOR WANTS TO ADDRESS BECAUSE AS I'VE IDENTIFIED IN A IN A PREVIOUS. SESSION IN THIS BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE I HAVE CONCERNS. WHAT ABOUT THE CONCENTRATION GRANT ITSELF AND HOW THAT OPERATES WHEN YOU HAVE TO SCHOOLS ON EITHER SIDE OF A DISTRICT LINE? ONE IN THE DISTRICT WITH 56%. AND ONE OF THE DISTRICT OF 46% BUT THE TWO ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS EACH HAVE 70% OF THE STUDENTS. FREE AND REDUCED LUNCH ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS AND FOSTER KIDS. AND IT DOESN'T COST ANY LESS TO EDUCATE THOSE STUDENTS IN THE DISTRICT WITH 46%. THAN IT DOES IN THE DISTRICT WITH 56%. AND NOW WE'RE LAYERING ANOTHER. MUCH OF STUFF. A TIED TO CONCENTRATION GRANTS SO ANYWAY. NOW WE CAN SHIFT OF ANOTHER GIVEN MY AROUND YOU. YES MA'AM. GOOD MORNING THEIR CARD HAS LA -- I WAS ASKED TO GIVE A HIGH LEVEL OVERVIEW OF THE EARLY EDUCATION BUDGET AS A CHILD CARE AND PRESCHOOL. THE MAY REVISION INCREASES -- TELL CAN PRESCHOOL SPENDING BY SEVENTY NINE MILLION COMPARED TO THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AND THIS IS A COMBINATION OF A DECREASE IN GENERAL FUND AN INCREASE IN FEDERAL FUNDS. I'M A FEW MAIN A FEW MAIN THINGS TO KNOW WITH THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AND THE MAY REVISION PROPOSAL. ON THE GOVERNOR IN JANUARY PROPOSED TEN THOUSAND FLIGHTS TO START JULY -- ONE AND SOME OF THAT DECREASE IN GENERAL FUND IS BECAUSE THEY'RE MOVING THAT START DATE UNTIL APRIL ONE SO DELAYED START SO DELAYED COSTS. ON THIS THIS A SECOND THING WITH REGARD TO STATE PRESCHOOL SLOTS. IS THE GOVERNOR'S WITHDRAWING HIS THREE YEAR PLAN JUST TO INCREASE TO PROVIDE THIRTY THOUSAND SLOTS WITHIN THREE YEARS AND ONLY PROVIDING THE FIRST. ONLY PLANS PROVIDE THE FIRST OF THOSE. THE FIRST OF THAT PLAN THE TEN THOUSAND FLIGHTS -- WE DO NOT HAVING A LONG TERM PLAN TO SERVE LOW INCOME FOR REAL SO TO PROVIDE THOSE THIRTY THOUSAND FOUGHT TO RAISES SOME CONCERNS FOR US WITH REMOVING THE WORK REQUIREMENT. A WE THINK REMOVING THE WORK REQUIREMENT COULD RESULT IN SERVING FEWER CHIN -- SERVING FEWER CHILDREN -- AND SERVING LESS WORKING FAMILIES -- JUST THE WAY SOME OF THE SHIFTING MIGHT HAPPEN THAT WITH SOME. REPHRASE RE RE RAISING SOME OF OUR CONCERNS WE'VE HAD IN JANUARY NOT HAVING A PLAN TO SERVE ALL LOW INCOME PEOPLE A LOW INCOME FOUR YEAR OLD BY THE STATE COULD EXACERBATE SOME OF THOSE CONCERNS. THE THE THE IN THE MAY REVISION THE GOVERNOR ALSO PROPOSE SOME TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE ON THE ONE TIME A ONE TIME FUNDING FOR FACILITIES WORKFORCE IN PLANNING INITIATIVES. THE TRICK SPECIFICALLY THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE FOR THE WORK OF THE FACILITY PROPOSAL. A WE RAISE CONCERNS WITH -- THAT THESE MAY REFER MAY REVISION LANGUAGE CHANGES AND MINIMIZE LEGISLATIVE IT IN PUT. ON THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE SPECIFIES THAT BY MARCH FIRST ADMINISTRATION WILL -- WILL DEVELOP A LOT OF THE TO THE KEY IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS OF THIS PROGRAM. AND ALSO THAT THE GRANT PROGRAM WILL CONSIDER RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE MASTER PLAN THAT WILL BE DEVELOPED UNTIL OCTOBER -- TWENTY TWENTY SO AND MOVING ON TO SOME OF THE FEDERAL FOR A THE FEDERAL FUND COMPONENT OF THIS THE MAIN REVISION. WARS RECENT INCREASES TO FEDERAL CC TO A FEDERAL GRAND AS ON GOING. AND THE GOVERNOR LAYS OUT A PLAN FOR HOW TO SPEND THESE FEDERAL FUNDS OF SOME FOR PROGRAMMATIC CHANGES AND SOME FOR A NEW PROGRAM. WE WOULD JUST NOTE THAT THIS IS ONE WAY TO SPEND THE FUNDS WITH THE LEGISLATURE DOES HAVE DISCRETION ON ON HOW TO SPEND THESE FUNDS WITH REGARD TO CHILD CARE PROGRAMS IN ANY WAY IT. IN ANY WAY IT COULD DECIDE -- SO THE LEGISLATURE WOULD LEGISLATURE COULD DECIDE TO USE FUNDS DIFFERENTLY -- AND THAT CONCLUDES MY REMARKS FROM HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS THANK YOU NEXT. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS KIND JACKSON. ON BEHALF OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT TONY THURMOND. OF OUR COLLEAGUES HERE HAVE GIVEN A REALLY GOOD OVER VIEW OF THE MAY REVISIONS ALL HIT ON SOME HIGH POINTS OUT FROM THE DEPARTMENT'S PERSPECTIVE. OF THE FIRST REALLY WANT -- TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR ELEVATING THE EDUCATIONAL ISSUES TAKE A MOMENT TO THANK THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE FOR THE MANY OPPORTUNITIES TO WORK THAT WORK WITH THEM DURING THIS TRANSITION PERIOD. THE DEPARTMENT APPRECIATES THE GOVERNOR'S CONTINUE COMMITMENT TO K. TWELVE EDUCATION FUNDING. PARTICULARLY IN IS ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT IN SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHER TRAINING STEAM AND EARLY EDUCATION. IT'S IMPORTANT THAT OUR STUDENTS ADDITIONAL DIGITAL LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES. SO THE TO SUPERINTENDENT APPRECIATES. THE TO SEE THE ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN THE MAY REVISION FOR STATE COMPUTER SCIENCE COORDINATOR AS WELL AS FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS TO EXPAND BROADBAND INTERNET CAPACITY. FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS. ADDITIONAL WE APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL FOR DISH -- INVESTMENTS IN THE TEACHER PIPELINE. ALMOST NINETY MILLION TO PROVIDE FOUR THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED TEACHERS UP TO TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IN GRANTS FOR TEACHING IN CERTAIN SCHOOLS AND SUBJECT AREAS. ALMOST FORTY FIVE MILLION AND ONE TIME NON PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT JOURNAL FUNDS TO PROVIDE TRAINING A RESOURCES TO CLASSROOM TEACHERS [inaudible] EDUCATORS. INCLUDING TEACHERS IMPAIR PROFESSIONALS IN ORDER TO BUILD CAPACITY AROUND INCLUSIVE PRACTICES AND AS MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY SOCIAL EMOTIONAL LEARNING COMPUTER SCIENCE AND RESTORATIVE PRACTICES. AS WELL AS SUBJECT MATTER COMPETENCE INCLUDING STEM. ANOTHER ALMOST OF FOURTEEN MILLION DOLLARS ONGOING FEDERAL FUNDS FOR FAST PROFESSIONAL LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES FOR PUBLIC. K. TWELVE SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS TO PROVIDE KNOWLEDGE SKILLS AND COMPETENCIESNECESSARY TO SUCCESSFULLY SUPPORT THE DIVERSE STUDENT POPULATION SERVED IN OUR SCHOOLS. ADDITIONALLY AND IMPORTANTLY WE'RE GRATEFUL TO SEE THE INVESTMENTS IN K. TWELVE EDUCATION OUTSIDE OF PROPOSITION. NINETY EIGHT THE ADDITIONAL FOUR POINT FOUR BILLION AND NON PROP NINETY EIGHT FUNDING IS HUGE. THESE RESOURCES WILL HELP DISTRICTS SCHOOLS IN COUNTY OFFICES PREPARE FOR STUDENTS PREPARE STUDENTS TO SUCCEED IN THE FUTURE. FOR EXAMPLE THE MAY REVISED PROPOSES THE ADDITIONAL HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION A ONE TIME NON PROP NINETY EIGHT INVESTMENTS AND CAL STIRS. THIS IS SIGNIFICANT AS IT WILL PROVIDE PHYSICAL RELIEF TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS FOR THE RISING COSTS OF PENSIONS. AND AS WE KNOW THIS IS IMPORTANT AS SCHOOLS TO BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN THEIR COMMITMENT TO THIS RESPECTFUL RETIREMENT OF YOUR EMPLOYEES AND TEACHERS. AS WELL AS MEETING THE FISCAL THEIR FISCAL OPERATING OBLIGATIONS. THE SUPERINTENDENT SUPPORTS AND APPRECIATE THE ADDITIONAL -- ALL A HUNDRED AND NINETEEN MILLION DOLLARS IN ONGOING PROPOSE FUNDING -- FOR SPECIAL ED SO THAT ELEAZAR CAN MEET THE NEEDS OF STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES ON THAT PROVISIONS OF THE IDA. RECOGNIZING THAT THE STATE'S HIGHEST NEEDS USE OFTEN REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT SUPPORTS SERVICES EMPLACEMENTS. SIMULTANEOUSLY THE SUPERINTENDENT IS CALLING ON THE US DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND CONGRESS. TO FULLY MEET THEIR FULL IDA I. D. E. A. OBLIGATIONS. ANOTHER VERY IMPORTANT ITEM IS AFFORDABLE TEACHER HOUSING WE SEEN BODIES OF EVIDENCE AND WE SEE OUR COMMUNITIES HOW DIFFICULT IT IS FOR TEACHERS TO ACQUIRE -- AFFORDABLE HOUSING WE APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR'S INVESTMENTS IN COMMUNITIES THAT WILL ULTIMATELY SUPPORT AFFORDABLE WORKFORCE HOUSING. AND WE KNOW WHEN WE INVEST IN OUR TEACHERS THEY WILL THEN INVEST IN OUR STUDENTS. IT IS VITAL THAT ARE DISTRICTS AND SCHOOLS -- BE ABLE. TO RECRUIT AND RETAIN OUR BRIGHTEST TEACHERS. THE GOVERNOR'S UP BUDGET INCLUDED SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN ONE TIME GENERAL FUND TO PARTNER WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. TO INCREASE HOUSING PRODUCTION THROUGH TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IN GENERAL PURPOSE FUNDING. OF WHICH JURISDICTIONS WILL RECEIVE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION ON THE SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION. FORCE A SIT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND STAFFING. THE MAY REVISION AD SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION AS JURISDICTIONS ELIGIBLE FOR PORTION OF THAT TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION. A DIFFERENT ADDITIONALLY THE MAY REVISE ALSO PROPOSES TO EXPAND TAX CREDITS UP TO FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN. TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY TWENTY UP TO TWO HUNDRED MILLION OF THE NEWLY AUTHORIZED CREDITS WOULD BE AVAILABLE TO INCREASE DEVELOPMENT. OF MIXING COME HOUSING PROJECTS TO SERVE A BROADER RANGE OF INCOMES UP TO A HUNDRED AND 20% OF A MRI. AND THIS WOULD ALLOW MORE TEACHERS TO HAVE ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING. WITH RESPECT EARLY EDUCATION THE EARLY LEARNING AND CARE THE SUPERINTENDENT'S VERY APPRECIATIVE OF THE MAY REVISIONS PROPOSAL -- FOR A EIGHTY POINT FIVE MILLION IN PROP SIXTY FOUR FUNDS FOR SERVING SCHOOL AGE CHILDREN AND THE GENERAL CHILD CARE PROGRAM. AND IN CLOSING WERE APPRECIATIVE OF THE POSITIVE WORKING RELATIONSHIPS THAT WE HAVE WITH THE COMMITTEE AND THE COMMITTEE STAFF. WE'RE GRATEFUL THAT THE ADMINISTRATION OF RECOGIZED AND SUPPORTED THE ADDITIONAL WORKLOAD FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TO EMPLOYMENT. THE NEW AND EXISTING PROGRAMS AND HAVE PROVIDED PROVISION POSITIONS TO ENSURE THAT THE PROGRAMS WILL BE. PROPERLY IMPLEMENTED WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND THE ADMINISTRATION TO IRON OUT THE DETAILS OF THE MAY REVISION. AND ONCE AGAIN APPRECIATE EVERYONE'S CONTINUED SUPPORT TO EDUCATION THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. ANYTHING FURTHER ON CHILD CARE EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION. SAYING NOT WE WILL GO TO CALIFORNIA MANY COLLEGES JUST MA'AM. GOOD AFTERNOON I'M LARA MATTOON ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE CHANCELLOR OAKLEY I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNIST BEACH TODAY AND WE APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR'S CONTINUED SUPPORT FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGES IN THE MAY REVISION. WE WANTED TO JUST RAISE A FEW AREAS OF I DID WHERE WE BELIEVE ADDITIONAL WORK IS NECESSARY -- FIRST WE DON'T BELIEVE THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL TO MAKE CHANGES TO THE FUNDING FORMULA IN THE CURRENT YEAR IS FEASIBLE. I'M DISTRICTS ARE JUST FORTY SEVEN DAYS AWAY FROM ENDING THEIR CURRENT BUDGET YEAR -- THERE AND WE THINK THAT ASKING THEM TO MAKE CHANGES AT THIS TIME IS IMPRACTICAL I WOULD LIKE TO ASSURE ADDITIONAL ONE TIME DOLLARS ARE AVAILABLE TO DISTRICTS IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN SO THAT THEY RECEIVE THE EXPECTED. OF FUNDING AMOUNTS IN THAT YEAR. I WE SUPPORT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO EXTEND THE EXISTING PROVISIONS FOR THE COMMITTING MINIMUM REVENUES FOR DISTRICTS TO TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO EXTENDING ESSENTIALLY THAT HOME HOLD HARMLESS FOR ONE ADDITIONAL YEAR -- AND WE ALSO AGREE WITH THE ADMINISTRATION THAT THE FUNDING FORMULA DOES WARRANT ADDITIONAL REVIEW. WE BELIEVE HOWEVER THAT FOR CHANGES TO BE MADE IN THE NINETEEN TWENTY A YEAR IT'S CRITICAL THAT COLLEGES HAVE SOME ADVANCE NOTICE OF THOSE CHANGES AND THEREFORE WE'D LIKE TO SEE THOSE CHANGES INCORPORATED INTO THIS YEAR'S BUDGET -- FIRST AND FOREMOST I WANT TO FOCUS ON THE THREE CHANGES THAT WE BELIEVE ARE OF THE HIGHEST PRIORITY THAT RESPOND TO SOME CRITICAL ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED BY THE ADMINISTRATION. OF FIRST WE'D LIKE TO CHANGE THE FUNDING FORMULA SUCCESS METRICS TO COUNT ONLY THE HIGHEST AWARD ACHIEVED IN A SINGLE YEAR -- RATHER THAN EVERY DEGREE AND CERTIFICATE THAT THE CHIEF. SECOND I WOULD LIKE TO COUNT TRANSFERS IN THE DISTRICT OF RESIDENTS ONLY IF THE STUDENT HAS COMPLETED A MINIMUM MINIMUM NUMBER OF UNITS AT THAT IN THAT DISTRICT TWELVE UNITS IS THE NUMBER WERE RECOMMENDING. AND THEN THIRD AND C. T. E. CERTIFICATE ATTAINMENT ALL RIGHT NOW YOU CAN RECEIVE A BONUS FOR ACHIEVING NINE C. T. E. UNITS WOULD LIKE TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE NINE UNITS ARE ALL IN THE SAME DISCIPLINE NOT JUST A RANDOM SHOT OF NINE UNITS. WILL BE TRANSMITTING A LETTER TO YOU IN THE COMING DAYS -- THAT SUPPORTS THESE RECOMMENDATIONS AND HAS BROAD SUPPORT FROM ACROSS OUR SYSTEM. I'M IN TERMS OF FINANCIAL AID WE'D LIKE TO EXPRESS OUR APPRECIATION TO THE GOVERNOR'S CONTINUED COMMITMENT TO ENSURE THAT TUITION IS NOT A BARRIER TO OUR STUDENTS -- WE SUPPORT THE CONTINUED FUNDING FOR A SECOND YEAR OF COLLEGE PROMISE WELL THERE'S A LOT OF TALK ABOUT THE FREE TUITION COMPONENT OF COLLEGE PROMISE IT'S IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT THE COLLEGE PROMISES REALLY A STRATEGY. FOR ENSURING STUDENTS KNOW THAT THEY HAVE A PATHWAY TO WIN THROUGH OUR COLLEGES COLLEGES ARE REQUIRED TO IMPLEMENT EVIDENCE BASED STRATEGIES THAT SUPPORT STUDENT SUCCESS AND TO MAXIMIZE ACCESS TO EXISTING NEED BASED AID SUCH AS PELL GRANT AND CAL GRANT FOR THOSE STUDENTS THAT ARE ELIGIBLE. BUT WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT FAR TOO FEW STUDENTS IN OUR SYSTEM ARE ELIGIBLE FOR CAL GRANT WHICH IS WHY WE CONTINUE TO PUSH FOR SENATE BILL -- TWO NINETY ONE WHICH WOULD CREATE A NEW GRANT PROGRAM FOCUSED EXPLICITLY ON CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS TO ADDRESS THEIR FOOD AND HOUSING COSTS. AND ARE SPECIFIC REQUESTS THERE IS TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION GENERAL FUND IN THE NINETEEN TWENTY BUDGET TO BEGIN THAT PROGRAM I ALSO WANT TO MENTION IN REGARDS TO THE RAPID RE HOUSING ISSUE THAT WAS RAISED EARLIER -- THAT FUNDING APPEARS TO COME FROM US SENATE BILL FIVE SIXTY EIGHT BY SENATOR PORTANTINO THAT'S A BILL THAT WE'RE SUPPORTIVE OF AND WERE SUPPORTIVE OF THE PROPOSED TEN MILLION DOLLARS OFF IN NON NINETY EIGHT RESOURCES THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN PROVIDED TO OUR SYSTEM. TO IMPLEMENT RAPID RE HOUSING ACROSS THE SYSTEM -- I FINALLY JUST WANT TO MENTION THAT WE APPRECIATE THE ADMINISTRATION'S -- RECOGNITION OF THE STAFFING NEEDS IN THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE AND THE APPROPRIATION OF ADDITIONAL THREE POSITIONS TO HELP US FOR FILL CORE FUNCTIONS. RELATED TO FISCAL MONITORING AND PROGRAM ADMINISTRATION. AND WE APPRECIATED THE CONVERSATION THAT OCCURRED LAST WEEK REGARDING THE LEGISLATURE'S INTEREST IN UNDERSTANDING HOW CURRENT -- POSITION ALLOCATIONS ARE BEING USED IN THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE AND WE'RE ADDITIONAL NEEDS MIGHT EXIST SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THAT. I ONCE AGAIN WE APPRECIATE THE FOCUS ON COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS AND THE FOCUS AT THIS GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PLACES ON THE NEEDS OF OUR STUDENTS I'M HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS [inaudible] THE THE COLLEGE PROMISE PROGRAM. THAT ALSO WITH THAT ALSO APPLIES AND MAYBE WE COVERED THIS BEFORE AND I'VE JUST FORGOTTEN THAT ALSO APPLIES TO A STUDENT WHO DOESN'T IMMEDIATELY MOVE FROM HIGH SCHOOL TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE BUT IN ROLES MAYBE AT THE THREE YEAR POINT. SO THE WAY THE CALIFORNIA COLLEGE PROMISE GRANT WORKS. ANY STUDENT CAN RECEIVE A FEE WAIVER IF THEY HAVE FINANCIAL NEED. IF A STUDENT DOESN'T HAVE FINANCIAL NEED. THEY CAN FALL INTO THIS COLLEGE PROMISE FRAMEWORK AND THAT DOES APPLY TO STUDENTS THAT GO STRAIGHT FROM HIGH SCHOOLINTO COLLEGE SHE DOES NOT HAVE NEED IF THEY DON'T HAVE THE BUT IF A STUDENT HAS NEED. THEY WOULD RECEIVE A CALIFORNIA COLLEGE PROMISE GRANT. WHICH WAS FORMERLY CALLED THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS FEE WAIVER WHICH MIGHT BE THE WAY THAT YOU KNOW. I'M JUST TRYING TO YOU KNOW OF I'M I'VE BEEN BOTHERED SINCE I ASSUME THIS TOOK THIS ASSIGNMENT. BY THE FACT THAT THE IF YOU. TAKE CARE OF YEAR AND A HALF OR TWO TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S GOING ON AFTER YOU GRADUATE FROM HIGH SCHOOL. YOU FALL INTO THIS AND YOU HAVE NEED YOU FALL INTO THIS COMPETITIVE GRANT PROCESS WE'RE APPARENTLY ONLY 10% OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO HAVE NEED RECEIVE THE RECEIVE HELP. AND I WAS JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW THIS. COLLEGE PROMISE PROGRAM IN -- INTERACTED WITH THAT BY THAT LOCATION YEAH THAT'S STUDENTS THAT COMES TO US FIVE OR TEN YEARS AFTER HIGH SCHOOL THAT HAS FINANCIAL NEED WOULD STILL QUALIFY TO RECEIVE A TUITION WAIVER -- UNDER THE PROMISE GRANT. AND WE WOULD TRYING PACKAGE THEIR AID SO THAT WE COULD ACCESS EITHER A COMPETITIVE GRANT OR A PELL GRANT -- OTHER RESOURCES THAT COULD HELP OFFSET THEIR NON TUITION COST. THANK YOU DO NEED LABOR. FOR COMMENTS [inaudible] QUESTIONS. EXCELLENT. THIS. FINISHES THE ISSUE. PRESENTATION. NOW PUBLIC COMMENT. LIZ BUT THAT'S ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF SCHOOL BUSINESS OFFICIALS WERE IN SUPPORT OF THE ONE POINT NINE BILLION DOLLARS FOR LOW -- LCF OFTEN THE STATEWIDE SYSTEM OF SUPPORT. I DO WANT TO MENTION AND THE MAY REVISION ADMINISTRATION IS SHIFTING THREE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY NINE POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS INTO THE P. S. S. A. ACCOUNT THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM STABILITY ACCOUNT. FOR THE THESE DOLLARS WILL COUNT TOWARDS MEDIAN THE PROP NINETY EIGHT GENERAL MINIMUM GUARANTEE BUT WILL NOT BE ACCESSIBLE DOLLARS FOR TODAY STUDENTS AND THEIR EDUCATIONAL NEEDS. WE ALSO OPPOSE THE THIRTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE CLASSIFIED SCHOOL EMPLOYEE SUMMER SYSTEMS PROGRAM. ARE WE OPPOSE A REDIRECTION OF RESOURCES FOR TO PROGRAM THAT IS NOT TIED TO EDUCATIONAL NEEDS NOR IMPROVING PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT FOR THE LOW. LOS WAGE EMPLOYEES WE DO SUPPORT THE INCREASE AND ONGOING FUNDING FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION BUT WE WANT TO SUPPORT THE FUNDING DISTRIBUTION MODEL IN A B. FOR TWENTY EIGHT BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER MEDINA. WE SUPPORT THE NATIONAL HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS AS A DOWN PAYMENT FOR CAL STORES EMPLOYER RATE FOR THE TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY SCHOOL YEAR. WE'RE IN SUPPORT OF THE HUNDRED AND FORTY EIGHT POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE TEACHERS AND ADMINISTRATORS RECRUITMENT EFFORTS.

THOSE WHO'VE NEVER ESTABLISHED CREDIT HISTORY -- ARE OFTEN VULNERABLE AND BY IN THAT HAVE GREAT DIFFICULTY FINDING HOUSING SO THE RAPID RE HOUSING MODELS REALLY.

IS THE WAY TO GO AND WE WOULD ALSO AGREE WITH THE COMMENTS OF FOR MR COUPON. FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE THAT ARE BOTH EQUALIZATION. AND A DIRECTION OF FUNDS TOWARD. A STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES IN EARLY EDUCATION WOULD BE A FAR MORE BENEFICIAL TO THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND RIVERSIDE COUNTY.

IN THE ENTIRE COUNTRY WE HAVE THE SECOND HIGHEST CONCENTRATION OF INTENSE POVERTY. OUR SPECIAL EDUCATION CONTRIBUTION FROM THE GENERAL FUND TO SEVENTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR -- THE GOVERNOR'S PROGRAM WOULD SEND US EXACTLY ZERO DOLLARS. BECAUSE WE ARE BELOW THE STATEWIDE AVERAGE -- WE FEAR THAT THE PROPOSAL DOES NOT DO ANYTHING TO ADVANCE THE LC OF PFAFF AS FAR AS EQUITY RATIONALITY OR TRANSPARENCY THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU SIR. YES MA'AM EMILY ROSENBERGER WAS SERVICE EMPLOYEES INTERNATIONAL UNION IS A NUMBER OF ITEMS IN THE BUDGET THAT WAS FOR I'LL ALSO BE SENDING A LETTER BUT I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO TAKE A MOMENT TO TALK ABOUT THE SUMMER -- CLASSIFIED -- EMPLOYEES SUMMER BRIDGE ASSISTANCE THE NUMBER OF NAMES ABOUT IT BUT WE HELP GET THAT IN THE BUDGET LAST YEAR'S AND WE WORKED ON FOR SIX YEARS.

THANK YOU MA'AM. YES SIR GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR ROB SENATOR MORALE AND JAKE RENDER ON BEHALF OF THE CAMPAIGN FOR COLLEGE OPPORTUNITY THERE'S MUCH THAT WE APPRECIATE IN THE GOVERNOR'S REVISED BUDGET PROPOSAL PARTICULARLY AROUND INVESTMENTS. TO INCREASE THE CAPACITY TO SERVE MORE CALIFORNIA STUDENTS THAT THE CSU -- AND INVESTMENTS AND FINANCIAL AID IN LONGITUDINAL DATA SYSTEMS FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND OUR STUDENTS THERE ARE STILL AREAS WHERE WE HOPE THAT THE LEGISLATURE CAN WORK WITH THE GOVERNOR -- PARTICULARLY AROUND -- TO YOUR COMMENTS SENATOR ROTH I'M INSURING THAT INVESTMENTS IN OUR FINANCIAL AID SYSTEM REALLY ADDRESSED THE HUNDREDS. OF THOUSANDS OF DENIED ELIGIBLE STUDENTS WERE APPLYING FOR THAT COMPETITIVE CAL GRANT PROGRAM AND WE DO MORE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE HELPING THE STUDENTS ADDRESS THEIR NON TUITION EXPENSES. I'M WE ALSO HOPE THAT THE LEGISLATURE CAN WORK WITH. THE ADMINISTRATION TO ENSURE THAT ANY LONGITUDINAL DATA SYSTEM THAT WE ESTABLISH IN THE GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE WILL. FOR IT -- INCLUDES EXTERNAL STAKEHOLDERS IN ADDITION TO OUR INSTITUTIONAL PARTNERS AND REALLY HAS SOME TO CLEAR GOALS AROUND THE PURPOSE OF THIS STATUS SYSTEM AND HOW THE STATE'S GOING TO BE ABLE TO UTILIZE THAT TO IMPROVE STUDENT SUCCESS. AND CLOSE THE A DEGREES GAP THAT WE STILL FACE AND FINALLY WE HOPE THAT THE LEGISLATURE CAN WORK WITH THE GOVERNOR TO IDENTIFY THE ABILITY TO SERVE MORE OF OUR CALIFORNIA STUDENTS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. WE'RE GOING TO BE SHORT BY OVER ONE MILLION BACHELOR'S DEGREES BY TWENTY THIRTY TO MEET WORKFORCE NEEDS AND NEED TO EXPAND THE ABILITY FOR THE UNIVERSITY TO SERVE MORE STUDENTS AS WERE INCREASING. A THREE G. COMPLETION RATES ARE HIGH SCHOOLS AND FINALLY ON BEHALF OF OUR CALIFORNIA UNDOCUMENTED HIGHER EDUCATION COALITION WERE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THE INVESTMENTS IN LEGAL SERVICES FUNDING -- BOTH AT THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES AND AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. IMMIGRANT LEGAL SOURCE. IMMIGRANT LEGAL SERVICES CENTER WITH THE SLIGHT INCREASE IN THE MAY REVISIONS STARTING IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO AND WE SUPPORT THAT PROPOSAL I THANK YOU THANKS SIR NEXT. GOOD AFTERNOON REBEKAH CURLY ON BEHALF OF THE COALITION FOR ADEQUATE SCHOOL HOUSING TO SPEECH ON THE FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN PROPOSAL FOR FACILITIES WE'RE COMFORTABLE WITH THE SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. AND WE DO ASK YOU TO PLEASE FIX THE ELIGIBILITY ISSUES SO THERE IS A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FUNDS THAT YOU WOULD RECEIVE IN THIS PROGRAM. AND OUR TYPICAL SCHOOL FACILITY PROGRAM WHERE SCHOOLS RECEIVE FUNDS FOR NEW CONSTRUCTION AND MODERNIZATION -- RIGHT NOW A NEW CLASSROOM THAT YOU WOULD BUILD THROUGH THE FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR PROGRAM WOULD END UP BEING CHARGED AGAINST YOUR BASS LINE ELIGIBILITY IN THE SCHOOL FACILITY PROGRAM. SO WHAT THIS MEANS IS THAT WOULD BE A HIT AGAINST FUTURE PROJECTS THAT A DISTRICT MAY NEED TO DO IN THE K. THROUGH SIXTH GRADE CATEGORY. SO NOT JUST KINDERGARTEN IT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN FIX WE URGE YOU TO DO SO. BUT WE ALSO DON'T SEE A NEED TO ADJUST THE MATCH FROM 5275% THIS IS BECAUSE MOST OF THE DOLLARS IN THE FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN ARE BEING TARGETED TO LOW INCOME -- DISTRICTS THOSE ARE DISTRICTS THAT ARE PARTICIPATING IN THE FINANCIAL HARDSHIP PROGRAM WHERE THEY SEE A LARGER MATCH FROM THE STATE. SO THERE'S NO REASON TO ADJUST FROM 5275% BECAUSE THEY'RE ALREADY RECEIVING MORE -- AND THEN ON BEHALF OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE FACILITY COALITION I JUST WANTED TO ENCOURAGE YOUR SUPPORT FOR THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE FUNDING THE THIRTY NINE POINT SIX MILLION. AND OF COURSE THERE'S A NEXUS BETWEEN -- MAINTENANCE AND CAPITAL OUTLAYS SO WE URGE YOU TO FUND ALL THIRTY NINE OF THE PROJECTS THAT WERE APPROVED BY THE BOARD OF OVERNORS THANK YOU THANK YOU NEXT. WHO MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS IAN PEDIA RIGHT -- REPRESENTING TODAY -- COALITION FOR ADEQUATE SCHOOL HOUSING COUNTY SCHOOL FACILITIES CONSORTIA SCHOOL ENERGY COALITION AND THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA CONSTRUCTION MANAGERS AND THIS IS ON PROPOSITION FOR A FIFTY ONE BONDS -- WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL FOR THE ONE POINT FIVE BILLION -- BUT THE REALITY IS THAT THERE IS AN ALLEY FOR NEARLY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN PROJECTS RIGHT NOW THAT IF THEY'RE NOT FUNDED -- IN A MORE ACCELERATED MANNER -- IF YOU IT'LL BE A QUITE A FEW YEARS BEFORE THOSE -- THE KIDS BASICALLY ARE ABLE -- TO UTILIZE THOSE FACILITIES SO WE SUPPORT. INCREASED OF MORE THAN THAT AMOUNT AND CERTAINLY SENATOR -- MAGUIRE'S PROPOSAL -- TO TO FUND THE WHOLE -- ABOVE -- LIST AS WELL AS THE STAFF RESOURCES NECESSARY -- TO PROCESS THE APPLICATIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT. GOOD AFTERNOON MICHELLE MCANDREW IT ON BEHALF OF THE COALITION FOR ADEQUATE FUNDING FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION I LIKE MANY OF THE SPEAKERS BEFORE ME WERE VERY APPRECIATIVE OF THE ADDITIONAL ONGOING FUNDING -- UNDER THE UMBRELLA OF SPECIAL EDUCATION BUT WE REMAIN CONCERNED AS YOU DO AND THE LA -- DOES AND MANY OTHERS ABOUT THE FUNDING METHODOLOGY THAT'S PROPOSED FOR THE CONCENTRATION GRANT YOU MAY REMEMBER THE THE DATA POINT THAT ONLY ABOUT A QUARTER OF ELEAZAR WOULD RECEIVE THESE FUNDS. THOSE THAT QUALIFY BOTH WITH A CONCENTRATION GRANT AND THE ABOVE AVERAGE STATEWIDE AVERAGE OF STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES -- ONE DATA POINT THAT I RECENTLY ACQUIRED AS THAT OF THE SPECIAL EDUCATION POPULATION THERE'S ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED SEVENTY THOUSAND ONLY ABOUT 6% WOULD ACTUALLY GENERATE THESE FUNDS SO THE OTHER AT 9294% OF STUDENTS WHEN GENERATED FUNDS. WE KNOW THAT THE NEED FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION FUNDING AS STATEWIDE -- WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE -- DIS EQUALIZATION'S AROUND THE STATE AND WE THINK INSTEAD OF DOUBLING DOWN ON THAT AND ALREADY RECEIVE -- MORE UNDER AB SIX OR TO RECEIVE IT EVEN MORE THROUGH THIS CONCENTRATION GRANT WE THINK THAT WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING IS EQUALIZING -- AB SIX OH TWO PROVIDING ADDITIONAL RESOURCES FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS AND FOR THOSE WITH HIGH COSTS NEEDS -- THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE'VE BEEN PROPOSING UNDER EIGHTY FOUR TWENTY EIGHT AND WE HOPE THAT YOU WOULD CONSIDER ABOUT FOR THE SIX HUNDRED NINETY SIX MILLION BEING PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNOR. THANK YOU THANK YOU NEXT.

HARM AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S A HUGE PRIORITY TO US. AND FINALLY THERE'S ALSO NO FUNDING THAT WAS ALLOCATED TO THE UNIVERSITY ON TOP OF WHAT WAS ALREADY THERE -- TO WHAT JUST FOR HE ENROLLMENT EXPANSION AND AND THE NEED FOR FUNDING TO MAINTAIN THE TUITION FROZEN THROUGHOUT THE NEXT YEAR AND WE KNOW THAT THE UNIVERSITY HAS. COMMITTED THAT THE STATE -- RESIDENT TUITION DOESN'T INCREASE NEXT YEAR BUT IF THE FUNDING DOESN'T COME TO UNIVERSITY.

THANK YOU SIR. MISTER CHAIR OF MICHAEL SIZER ON BEHALF OF THE FORTY SEVEN SCHOOL DISTRICTS TURN KERN COUNTY I'M GOING TO SPEAK FROM THE SAME PERSPECTIVE THAT YOU HAVE MISTER CHAIR. AND OTHERS HERE ABOUT THE CONCERNS OF INEQUITY IN SPECIAL EDUCATION. I'LL SAY SOME THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN SET THOUGH. SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE ALL CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES HAVE BEEN ENTITLED TO THE SAME SERVICES AND PROGRAMS. REGARDLESS OF WHERE THEY LIVE IN CALIFORNIA [inaudible] UNFORTUNATELY STUDENTS IN RIVERSIDE AND SALMON A DINO AND BAKERSFIELD IN SACRAMENTO ARE RIGHT NOW FUNDED ABOUT 30% LESS THAN THE HIGHEST FUNDED DISTRICTS IN THE STATE -- IN YET THEY HAVE THE SAME OBLIGATION. WE THANK THE GOVERNOR FOR PUTTING IN THE MONEY THAT HE'S PUT IN -- IF THOSE DOLLARS WERE EARMARKED TOWARDS EQUALIZATION WE WOULD EFFECTIVELY ELIMINATE THAT GAP. BETWEEN THOSE LOW FUNDED DISTRICTS AND SELF AS AN OUR HIGHEST FUNDED IT DOESN'T SOLVE THE ADEQUACY PROBLEM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS NOT LIVING UP TO ITS RESPONSIBILITY. BUT THE EQUITY IS A MAJOR PROBLEM BECAUSE WE GUARANTEE ALL STUDENTS THE SAME LEVEL OF SERVICES. AND SO -- BASED UPON THE NEW SPENDING AND REVENUE ESTIMATES OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WE THINK THIS MAY BE THE LAST YEAR. YOU'LL HAVE THESE KINDS OF DOLLARS THESE DISCRETIONARY DOLLARS TO YOUR MARK TOWARDS THIS KIND OF INEQUITY. AND BEFORE WE START BUILDING NEW PROGRAMS AND SERVICES ALL OF THEM LAUDABLE AN ADMIRABLE WE NEED TO ADDRESS THE ACT WITH THE INEQUITY IN THE EXISTING SYSTEM I'M SURE YOU'RE HEARING THAT FROM YOUR DISTRICTS WE'RE CERTAINLY HEARING IT.
