IN ORDER TO- MAKE THIS BUDGET THAT WE HAVE ALREADY ADOPTED COMPLETE THERE ARE SOME THINGS WE WILL BE DOING IN THE- AFTER WE GET BACK FROM RECESS- BUT- SOME OF THE CORE ONES ARE HERE THAT WE'RE HEARING TODAY THERE ARE ELEVEN BILLS ON TODAY'S AGENDA. AND AS A REMINDER THE BUDGET BILL THAT IS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE WE PASSED ON JUNE TWENTY EIGHTH- AND LET ME GO THROUGH VERY QUICKLY THESE WHAT THESE TRAILER BILLS ARE DEAD THE STATE MAKE THE STATUTORY CHANGES NECESSARY TO IMPLEMENT MANY OF THE MAJOR COMPONENTS OF THAT JUNE TWENTY EIGHTH BUDGET AGREEMENT AND THEY ARE THE MEDICAID EXPANSION TO ALL INCOME ELIGIBLE CALIFORNIANS FIFTY PLUS YEARS OF AGE. THE WE ARE ELIMINATING THE ACID TEST FOR SENIORS WITH PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES ESTABLISHING THE YOUTH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INITIATIVE AND THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONTINUUM WELL I LOOKS LIKE BEFORE I CONTINUE WE MIGHT HAVE A QUORUM SO I WILL CONTINUE DESCRIBING THOSE TRAILER BILLS IN A MOMENT BUT I WILL ASK OUR CONSULT MR STEPHENS SHOT TO PLEASE CALL THE ROLL AND LET'S ESTABLISH A QUORUM. WITH SENATORS ARE SCANNER I'M HERE SKINNER HERE NELSON. LISTEN HERE COPYRIGHT. CORTESE DOLLY DOLLY HERE TO RAZA. THE RAZA HERE RAZA HERE EGGMAN A MAN HERE GROWTH COM LONGER. BLAIR LEHRER HERE MAGUIRE MELINDA'S MAN MAN HERE NEWMAN NEWMAN HERE A TROUBLED. TEN YEARS PENN HERE STERN WHY CASKEY MY CASKEY HERE. PFIZER WE HAVE ESTABLISHED A QUORUM SO LET ME RETURN TO BUT LET ME BEFORE I GO THROUGH THE MY KIND OF LIST OF TRAILER BILLS. I JUST WANT TO REMIND US WE'VE OBVIOUSLY THIS. BUT TO PROCESS THIS YEAR BECAUSE OF THE ENORMITY OF THIS BUDGET. IT IS THE LARGEST BUDGET WE'VE EVER ADOPTED IN FOR EXAMPLE AS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE IT HAS THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF FUNDING FOR UNDER PROP NINETY EIGHT FOR K. THROUGH TWELVE SCHOOLS FOR EXAMPLE. AND IT IS SO MANY OTHER COMPONENTS THAT WE'VE HAD A NUMBER OF BUDGET HEARINGS WHERE WE HAVE BEEN ADOPTING TRAILER BILLS IN ORDER TO PUT THE STATUTORY THINGS IN PLACE TO DEAL WITH THE APPROPRIATIONS WE MADE BUT THE FACT THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING IT- IN YOU KNOW IN- IN THESE DIFFERENT HEARINGS I THINK CAN SOMETIMES- BECAUSE FOLKS TO SERVE DILUTE. THE INCREDIBLE ENORMITY OF THIS AND THE TRANSFORMATIONAL ASPECT OF THIS BUDGET WHICH I PERSONALLY AND JUST VERY VERY HAPPY PLEASED AND THRILLED ABOUT. AND- I WILL REPEAT NOW. WHAT THESE TRAILER BILLS WILL DO WHICH COMMUNICATE SOME OF THE TRANSFORMATIVE ASPECTS OF THIS PROJECT WHICH IS. IN THE HEALTH AREA OUR TRAILER BILLS WILL ALLOW US TO ESTABLISH THIS YOUTH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INITIATIVE AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONTINUUM INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAM. THAT WILL ALLOW US TO EXPAND MEDICARE ALL FOR ALL OF OUR INCOME ELIGIBLE CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE FIFTY YEARS AND OLDER. IT WILL ELIMINATE THE ACID TEST FOR OUR SENIORS AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. AND THEN IN THE SOCIAL SERVICES AREA THOSE FOLKS IN CALIFORNIA WHO ARE DEPENDENT ON SS P. GRANTS WILL GET THERE. THEIR MONTHLY STIPENDS RACED. IT ALSO ENDS FOR GOOD THE USE OF OUT OF STATE PLACEMENTS FOR CALIFORNIA'S FOSTER CHILDREN SO WE ARE GOING TO AS WE SHOULD BE TAKE CARE OF OUR FOSTER CHILDREN HERE IN THE STATE IT ALSO GREATLY EXPANDS FINANCIAL AID TO HELP PUT US ON A PATH TOWARDS DEBT THREE COLLEGE AND FOR MANY IT DOES SOMETHING VERY VERY IMPORTANT WE KNOW WHEN THE TIME OF THIS PANDEMIC THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF ECONOMIC UPHEAVAL. WE KNOW THAT LOTS OF DIFFERENT SECTORS ARE GOING TO PERMANENTLY CHANGE AND MANY OF THE- KINDS OF JOBS THAT SOMEONE MAY HAVE RELIED ON BEFORE IT MATE THERE MAY BE FEWER OF THEM AND SO WE'VE ALWAYS TRADITIONALLY HAD. R. CAL GRANTS FINANCIAL AID TIED TO YOU HAD TO IF YOU IF YOU'RE GOING TO GO TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE THE ONLY WAY YOU GET THAT FINANCIAL AID IS IF YOU WENT WITHIN A FEW YEARS AFTER HIGH SCHOOL IF YOU'RE UNDER A CERTAIN AGE. NOW WE RECOGNIZE THAT PEOPLE WANT TO GET. NEW JOB SKILLS AND THAT OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM IS A GREAT THING FOR THAT SO OUR FINANCIAL AID PROGRAM PACKAGE AND THE STATUTES THAT WE'RE GONNA TAKE UP TODAY WILL DO THIS. ALLOWS MUCH BETTER FINANCIAL AID FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE INDEPENDENT OF WHAT AGE AND WHEN THEY WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL. AND OF COURSE THE DIGITAL DIVIDE WE HAVE OUR TRAILER BILL THAT DEALS WITH BROADBAND INVESTMENTS. VERY SIGNIFICANT ONES AND OF COURSE OUR EXPANSION OF CHILD CARE MANY MORE CHILDREN WILL BE ABLE TO GET. ACCESS TO MORE AFFORDABLE CHILDCARE AND THE PEOPLE THAT ARE PROVIDING THAT CHILD CARE WILL GET THEIR RATES INCREASED SO THOSE ARE JUST SOME OF THE HIGHLIGHTS OF THE TRAILER BILLS THAT WERE TAKING UP TODAY. SO WE WILL HEAR THE- TEN TRAILER BILLS AND THE BUDGET BILL JUNIOR AND THEN WE WILL HAVE AN HOUR OF PUBLIC COMMENT AND AFTER THAT. WE WILL VOTE ON THE BILLS AND BEFORE I ASK THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO PRESENT. THE BUDGET BILL JUNIOR. ON MR VICE CHAIR WOULD YOU LIKE TO COMMENT.

APPORTIONMENT DEFERRALS- AGAIN WE'RE HAPPY TO RESPOND TO ANY QUESTIONS. GREAT CENTER LAYER. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I JUST THE THOUGHT OF PARTICULARLY I KNOW SENATOR SO TROUBLED AND MEN AND I ALL WORKED IN THE EDUCATION BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE BUT IT'S JUST REALLY APPROPRIATE TO NOT LET THIS PASS WITHOUT NOTING THAT THIS IS THE BEST BUDGET FOR HIGHER EDUCATION IN CALIFORNIA IN MODERN TIMES THE ARCHITECTURE OF THE BUDGET WHICH AS THEBAR REPRESENTATIVE OF FINANCE SAID WAS ALREADY SIGNED. UP R. AS THE BACKDROP REALLY EDIT CAME IN THREE SLUGS THIS YEAR BECAUSE THE GOVERNOR IN THE JAN TEN BUDGET- DIDN'T BRING US BACK TO THE AREA TO THE LEVEL THAT HIGHER EDUCATION WAS PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC THE STIMULUS DID THAT OR LATER IN THE YEAR AND THEN THE BUDGET THAT WE HAVE ADOPTED BRINGS US BACK TO WHERE WE WERE BEFORE THE PANDEMIC PLUS A ROUGHLY 5% COST OF LIVING INCREASE FOR CSU UC AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES. AND SIGNIFICANT AMONG IT IS WHAT WAS MENTIONED THAT THIS IS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT REFORM OF STUDENT AID IN MODERN TIMES WHETHER IT'S CAL GRANT THE MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP ARE WE REALLY WILL ADD A HUNDRED THOUSAND STUDENTS OVER THE SHORT TERM TO FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE AND IT IT IS IN THIS TRAILER BILL AND IT REALLY TAKES THINGS BEFORE IT WAS A LIMITED AMOUNT OF MONEY AND ALL THE RULES FOR JUST TO SCREEN PEOPLE OUT. AND NOW THERE WILL BE NO PENALTY FOR BEING A REENTRY STUDENTS THERE WILL BE NO PENALTY FOR HOW YOU FINISHED IN YOUR GRADE POINT AVERAGE BEFORE FEW OF FINANCIAL NEED AND YOU'RE QUALIFIED AND YOU'RE ADMITTED THIS WILL REALLY HELP YOU ALONG AND IT REALLY DOES MOVE US TOWARD THE GOAL OF A DEBT FREE COLLEGE EXPERIENCE. NOT A FREE COLLEGE EXPERIENCE DEBT FREE CAR X. AND THEN ADDITIONALLY. THE REFORM THAT REALLY DEALS WITH OUT OF STATE STUDENTS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA IS INCLUDED HERE WELL AND I THINK IT WAS A COMPROMISE COMPARED TO WHERE IT STARTED BECAUSE WHERE IT STARTED IT WAS SORT OF LET'S LIMIT TO A FLAT AMOUNT OF OUT OF STATE STUDENTS AT EACH OF THE TEN CAMPUSES AND WORD GODDESS THE THREE CAMPUSES. THAT HAVE THE HIGHEST PERCENTAGE OF OUT OF STATE STUDENTS WILL IN ESSENCE- BE LIMITED AND WE WILL FIND THE LOSS OF MONEY FROM THAT CHANGE FROM OUT OF STATE IN STATE AND BECAUSE WE FUNDED YOU SEE ADDITIONAL ENROLLMENT TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF SIXTY FIVE HUNDRED SLOTS IT WILL B A SOFTER LANDING FOR UC IN IMPLEMENTING THAT REFORM OF OUT OF STATE STUDENTS WE ALSO PAID OFF THE DEFERRALS AT COMMUNITY COLLEGES SO IN KEEPING WITH ALL ACROSS EDUCATION. WE ARE PAYING OFF DEBT AND GETTING OUT OF THE DEFERRALS SO THAT WE CAN BACK ME BACK STANDING ON OUR FEET AND- THERE ARE MANY OTHER THINGS STUDENT ACCESS TRAINING AND THE IMPORTANT THING IS THERE THIRTY NINE ITEMS IN THIS TRAILER BILL AND IT'S JUST A REAL TRIBUTE TO THE DIFFERENT PROBLEMS WE ARE ADDRESSING SO I THINK WE SHOULD ALL BE PROUD TO VOTE FOR THIS BILL.

ALSO ACTUALLY MAINTAINING THE STATE COUNTY COST RATIO BECAUSE WHAT PEOPLE MAY NOT REALIZE IS THAT BECAUSE OF THE REALIGNMENT. ESSENTIALLY IF THAT WASN'T RIVER IF WE DIDN'T. MAINTAIN THAT INSTEAD REVERSED IT WAS PLANNED THAT WOULD PUT A SQUEEZE ON BOTH MENTAL HEALTH AND PUBLIC HEALTH IS WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF PANDEMIC IN TERMS OF LOCAL FUNDING SO THIS WAS REALLY IMPORTANT. AS AS WELL WHILE STILL ENSURING THAT WE ARE VITAL SERVICES FOR OUR SENIORS. I HAVE TO I JUST SAYS SO I JUST WANNA RECOGNIZE THAT PARTICULAR I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF OTHER EXCELLENT THINGS AS WELL BUT- THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND- CENTER PAN I WAS KIND OF RAISED THE SAME THING I'M REALLY GLAD YOU BROUGHT UP. THE CHANGES THAT THIS TRAILER BILL DOES FOR IN HOME. SUPPORTIVE SERVICES PROGRAM REPEALING THAT 7% REDUCTION IN THE SERVICE HOURS WHAT WE SAW DURING THE PANDEMIC AND OF COURSE THIS THIS- REDUCTION IS BEEN FOR A LONG TIME BUT- DURING THE PANDEMIC. WE SAW MANY PEOPLE WERE EACH DAY SOME PEOPLE LOST THEIR JOBS BUT SOME PEOPLE WERE UNABLE TO GO TO WORK BECAUSE SO MANY OF THE SERVICES THAT THEY RELIED ON TO TAKE CARE OF FAMILY MEMBERS. HAD TO BE SUSPENDED OR WERE NOT BEING ABLE TO BEAT YOU KNOW COULDN'T BE- DEPLOYED. AND SO THEN THEY HAD TO STAY HOME AND TAKE CARE OF THOSE FAMILY MEMBERS NOW THAT OF COURSE. IF WE DON'T. PUT THOSE SERVICES BACK THEN PEOPLE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO STAY HOME THAT HURTS THE ECONOMY IT ONLY HURTS THE FAMILY WHO'S YOU KNOW DOESN'T HAVE THAT INCOME IT ALSO HURTS THE ECONOMY BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE PEOPLE GETTING BACK TO WORK. SO PART OF MY CELEBRATION OF THE CHILDCARE. AND SOME OF THE EDUCATION THINGS WE DID LIKE T. K. IN. THE AFTER SCHOOL AND THEN OF COURSE THIS I. HSS IS BECAUSE IT TAKES THAT BURDEN. OFF FAMILY MEMBERS TO ALLOW FOR ONE TO NEED CARE TO GET THE CARE THEY NEED TO REALLY APPRECIATE THAT YOU POINTED OUT AND THEN I WOULD POINT OUT THAT IN TERMS OF THE RESPONSIBLE BUDGETING SIDE. THE HISTORY WOULD BILL ALSO TRANSFERS.

IN SERIOUS SERIOUS EFFORT TO REDUCE HOMELESSNESS IN THIS STATE WHICH WE KNOW IS THAT CRISIS LEVELS BY INVESTING TWELVE BILLION OVER TWO YEARS. BUT IN ADDITION TO THAT. WE ARE HELPING TO THE OTHER INVESTMENTS IN HERE WILL HELP PREVENT HOMELESSNESS. FOR EXAMPLE IS THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE POINTED OUT. IT ALLOWS OUR- TREASURY IN CALIFORNIA HOUSING FINANCE AGENCY TO PUT TOGETHER A CALIFORNIA DREAM FOR ALL FIRST TIME HOME BUYERS PROGRAM. AND THEN. I HOPE THAT WE DO NOT FACE THIS BUT IF WE DO FACE A WAVE OF FORECLOSURES DUTY ECONOMIC HARM THAT THE PANDEMIC CAUSED ON SOME HOUSEHOLDS. THAT WE NOW HAVE THE ABILITY. TO WITH FINDING HERE TO SUPPORT COMMUNITY LAND TRUSTS TO PURCHASE THOSE FORECLOSED HOMES SO THAT THEY CAN MAKE THEM AVAILABLE TO LOW INCOME HOMEOWNERS AND POTENTIALLY EVEN TO THE VERY HOMEOWNER WHO'S- WAS FORECLOSED ON.

I'M HAPPY TO RESPOND TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS. ALL RIGHT LET'S SEE IF THERE'S ANY QUESTIONS ON THE- MAYBE ONE FORTY EIGHT THREE SOURCES TRAILER BILL. SENATOR DOLLY. THANK YOU THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR JUST. IT'S NOT WHAT'S IN THE BILLS WHAT'S LEFT OUT OF THE BILL THAT I WANTED TO ASK- LAST WEEK AS YOU KNOW I. I BROUGHT UP THE FACT THAT WE HAD PUT. FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS BACK IN THE BUDGET FOR A FIRE AND- I RATTLED OFF FOR FIVE PROJECTS JUST IN MY LOCAL COMMUNITY THAT I KNEW WERE NOT FUNDED. AND THAT WAS ABOUT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS WORTH AND I WONDERED WHY- THAT'S NOT IN THIS BUDGET WE'RE GONNA BE OUT FOR A MONTH. AND FIRES ARE RAGING ACROSS MY DISTRICT IN MANY OTHER DISTRICTS AND WE'RE RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF FIRE SEASON AND WE HAVE THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE. AND WE HAVE THE PROJECTS AVAILABLE MS WARNING WHY THAT. THANK YOU SENATOR DOLLY AND AS WE MENTIONED LAST WEEK ABOUT THROUGH EARLY ACTION WE HAVE FIVE HUNDRED THIRTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS- THAT'S BEEN RELEASED AND IS ALLOCATED FOR SOME SOME FOR PROJECTS- IN LOCAL AREAS AND THERE WILL BE FURTHER DISCUSSIONS IN REGARDS TO THE REMAINDER- BUT MY UNDERSTANDING AND I HAVE MY COLLEAGUE SERGIO- I GET ARE ON THE LINE FOR SOME DETAILS MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THOSE FUNDS ARE GOING OUT NOW. AND THAT THE FUNDS THAT ARE IN THE BUDGET FOR THAT THIS YEAR WILL ALSO BE EXPANDED ON LATER BUT THAT THERE ARE PROJECTS GOING ON CURRENTLY. YESTERDAY I GOT A FARM FINANCE JUST ELABORATE A LITTLE MORE YEAH THE DEPARTMENTS ARE CURRENTLY WORKING ON- IMPLEMENTING THE EARLY ACTION FUNDING- WAIT WHICH- PRIMARILY MOST OF IT IS ALREADY COMMITTED TO THE DIFFERENT PROJECTS AND- AGAIN IN THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION WHICH- IT AND THE BUDGET WAS HERE LAST WEEK- WITH THE GOVERNOR HE SIGNED- YOU KNOW THAT IS NOW. SET TO BE ACCELERATED INTO THE- NOW CURRENT YEAR IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO BUT- THE ALLOCATION OF THOSE FUNDING WILL BE DISCUSSED OVER SUMMER. SO DO I WANT TO BE CLEAR I'M TRYING TO IGURE OUT WHERE I HAVE TO GO TO GET THE RESOURCES FOR PROJECTS THAT I. HAVE ON THE BOOKS THAT ARE SICK WERE. READY TO GO THEIR SHOVEL READY PROJECTS AND I'M CONFUSED. SO THE I KNOW THAT DID DID WE SPEND ALL THE EARLY ACTION MONEY I GUESS IS WHAT MY QUESTION IS. AND IF NOT ARE THOSE FUNDS AVAILABLE RIGHT NOW AND IF THEY ARE I WANT TO KNOW WHERE I GO FIND HIM TO GET INTO THE PROJECTS THAT I NEEDED. TO FIND ON THE GROUND. WHAT WHAT I WAS TOLD LAST WEEK WAS. WE'RE GONNA PUT IN A TRAILER BILL. SO ONE TWENTY NINE AND HE WAS. BUDGET BILL JUNIOR WHICH WAS SIGNED YESTERDAY HAD THE RESOURCES IN IT. AND WE ADDED FIVE HUNDRED MILLION SO ARE WE GONNA WAIT TILL WE COME BACK TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO SPEND THAT MONEY THAT'S MY QUESTION. OR IS THERE MONEY RIGHT NOW AVAILABLE FOR THE PROJECTS THAT I. OUTLINED IN THE MANY MORE THAT I AM FINDING IN IN ALL THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA NOT JUST MY DISTRICT. YEAH SO THE ADDITIONAL FIVE HUNDRED MILLION THAT WAS DISCUSSED IN AT LAST WEEK'S HEARING THAT WAS- SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR AND- BUT YOU GO JUNIOR. IT IS NOT CURRENTLY AVAILABLE THAT'S GOING TO BE ALLOCATED LATER THIS SUMMER THE SPECIFIC- THAT CATEGORY THE FUNDING SIMILAR TO ALL THE EARLY ACTION WAS ALLOCATED. BUT ON THE QUESTION OF THE EARLY ACTION MONEY IT'S STILL BEING DISTRIBUTED CORRECT SO IN TERMS OF THE QUESTION THAT SENATOR DOLLY WAS ASKING SHOULDN'T SOME OF THE CONSERVANCY'S AND OTHERS THAT ARE RECEIVING THAT MONEY BE THE ONE TO HAVE THAT SO THAT HE CULD- DIRECT SUCH PROJECTS TO APPLYING TO THEM. YEAH AND A LOT OF THE FUNDING AND ESPECIALLY CONSERVANCIES TO OUR UNDERSTANDING HAS BEEN ALREADY COMMITTED TO CERTAIN PROJECTS AND SO I THINK THAT THERE'S THE INFORMATION YOU HAVE ON CERTAIN PROJECTS WE CAN DEFINITELY RELAY THE INFORMATION TO THE AGENCY AND CALIFORNIA THEIR DEPARTMENTS- BY I. TWO ARE STANDING A LOT OF THAT HAS BEEN COMMITTED ALREADY. PROJECTS. SO JUST ONE LAST COMMENT SO THAT THAT'S NOT SATISFACTORY TO ME. THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS WHICH WE STATED LAST WEEK WAS THAT CAL FIRE IS TAKING DOING THEIR JOB WHICH I LOVE THOSE PEOPLE I GOT A LOT OF THEM CALLING ME LAST WEEK SAYING. YOU KNOW I WOULD I'M NOT BEATING UP ON THEM THEY HAVE A JOB DOING OR DOING IT. BUT OUR JOB IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE KEEP OUR COMMUNITY SAFE AND WE HAVE. MORE MONEY THAN WE'VE EVER SEEN IN THIS STATE AND WE JUST SIMPLY CAN'T GET IT OUT. I HAVE PROJECTS AVAILABLE. THAT ARE NOT FUNDED MY CONSERVANCIES. AND MY FIRE SAFE COUNCILS- THE CONSERVANCY'S ALLOCATED THEM OF FUNDS YOU JUST STATED THAT THAT'S CORRECT WHY DON'T WE GIVE THEM THE MORE FUN MORE FUN SO THEY CAN ALLOCATE HIM. IF CAL FIRE'S NOT ABLE TO DO IT THAT'S THE POINT I'M TRYING TO DRIVE HOME AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE DO THAT I'D- BEEN TALKING WITH MY- CHAIRMAN OF SUB TO. ALMOST EVERY DAY AND I'M FINDING MORE PROJECTS THAN WHAT I STATED EARLIER THAT I WANT TO GET FUNDED. NOT NEXT YEAR I WANT THEM FUNDED NOW SO I'M HAVING TO. I UNDERSTAND WHEN IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN IN THIS BUDGET I'M REALLY FRUSTRATED THE FACT THAT WE'RE GONNA NEED. NOT PUT MONEY WHERE IT NEEDS TO GO I'M SORRY IF THIS ONE AGENCY CAN'T GET IT OUT BUT THERE ARE OTHER AGENCIES. THAT DO THIS EVERY DAY. LIKE THE CONSERVANCY'S AND THEY- THEY WORK WITH ARE FIRE SAFE COUNCILS ARE CD'S AND THEY'RE READY TO DO IT SO. FOR THE LIFE OF ME I'M I'M VERY FRUSTRATED RIGHT NOW THAT WE CAN'T PUT THIS MONEY TO GROUND WE'RE GONNA WAIT WE'RE GONNA TAKE A RECESS. AND THEY WERE GONNA TRY TO FIGURE OUT SO IT'S GOING TO BE SEPTEMBER. TWO MONTHS PROBABLY BEFORE. WE GET MONEY ON THE GROUND AND THEN IT'LL BE IN THE FALL. SO THAT'S THE PROBLEM IS THAT IF ONE AGENCY IS NOT ABLE TO DO IT. AND OTHERS ARE THAN THIS REDIRECT THOSE FUNDS. TO THE AGENCIES THEY CAN GET IT DONE THIS IS THE END OF THE DAY. WE'RE STILL DOING THE RIGHT THING BY GETTING THE PROJECT DONE. SENATOR DOLLY IN TERMS OF THE L. THAT SPECIFIES THE- THIS IS THE NEW PREPARATION THAT WE JUST RECENTLY DID WE CAN CERTAINLY YOU CAN CERTAINLY WORK WITH THAT BUDGET COMMITTEE THE BUDGET STAFF TO CRAFT THAT WILDFIRE PACKAGE. SENATOR FORECASTING. YEAH I DO I DON'T DISAGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM- LASSEN COUNTY HAS SAID. WITH THIS TRAILER BILL DOES IS IT DOES PUSH OUT THE RULES FOR THAT FOR- THE UTILITY- THE- PAYMENT SAID THE ARREARS IT MAKES IT CLEAR THAT ALSO EXTENDS TO THE SEWER DISTRICT CAREER AVERAGES IF PEOPLE HAVE SEPARATED DISTRICTS AS WELL AS THE MONEY ON THE ON THE DROUGHT- WE HAVE BEEN IN CONVERSATIONS. IT'S WHAT'S NOT ON HERE IS THE CLIMATE RESILIENCY PACKAGE AND ALSO THE WILDFIRE- I WILL SAY SIERRA NEVADA DID GET SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS AND EARLY ACTION AND THE OTHER CONSERVANCY'S GOT THE MONEY THE WORD ON THE STREET IS THAT THEY HAVE COMMITTED ALL THAT MONEY TO FIGHT TWO PACKAGES AND THAT WAS WHAT PART OF OUR THINKING HERE IN THE SENATE WAS THAT WE KNEW. CONSERVANCIES IN PARKS AND FISH AND WILDLIFE HAS LOTS OF LOTS OF THINGS TO GO ON SO LOTS OF PROJECTS THE PESO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THE SUBCOMMITTEE WILL BE LOOKING AT IS WE'VE MADE RECOMMENDATIONS ON A BILLION DOLLARS- ON SPENDING. IT LOOKS IS THAT WITH THE FIVE pHAS WE'RE UP TO SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS SO THERE'S A DELTA THERE OF NUMBERS THAT ARE BETTER OFF BUT- WE'RE GETTING A LAY OF THE LAND OF HOW WITH THAT COMBINATION OF MIX DO WE GIVE IT TO CAL FIRE AND LET THEM GIVE OUT GRANTS. TO WE GIVE OUT FOLLOW OUR EARLY WILDFIRE ACTIONS WE GIVE. MONEY. DIRECTLY TO DIFFERENT- DIFFERENT AGE. I WILL SAY THAT YOU KNOW THIS IS A THIS TRAILER BILL HAS A MIX AND MATCH OF LITTLE THINGS YOU KNOW THEY'VE GOT. THE GOVERNORS- UP PARKS BED PROGRAM. FOR FOURTH GRADERS IS SOMETHING YOU KNOW THAT'S IT'S A NICE THING AND I SEE EXAMPLE FOR- CHILDREN TO BE ABLE TO TAKE THEIR FAMILY TO- THE STATE PARKS IN. A VERY IMPORTANT PILOT PROGRAM ON RECYCLING THAT WE NEED TO DO AND FOR THE AG COMMUNITY LEADERS WERE ACTUALLY GIVEN THE THIRD FRAME WORK ON HOW THE AIRPORTS GET A DOLE OUT THIS HUNDRED AND EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR ALTERNATIVES TO BURNING- THE FEELS I KNOW THAT THE FOLKS. ARE EAGER TO GET TO GET THAT MONEY BECAUSE THAT'S LINING UP- SO WE DO HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO THE BIG THE BIG ENCHILADAS. AS JOHN SEBASTIAN SAID. HOT TIME SEPARATE THE CITY WE WILL BE WORKING IN SACRAMENTO TO. TO MAKE SURE THESE PACKAGES GET TOGETHER SOMETHING THAT THIS THE STATE MAY END THE SENATE MEMBERS. SENATOR JOE VOGUE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. AS CHAIR OF THE INLAND EMPIRE CAUCUS WE HAVE ADVOCATED FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO ASSIST RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL CUSTOMERS WITH WATER AND WASTE WATER AREA JUST. AN ADDRESS REVENUE SHORTFALLS INCURRED BY WATER ENTERPRISE DOING THE COVER NINETEEN PANDEMIC I AM PLEASED TO SEE THE FUNDING FOR THIS ISSUE INCLUDED IN THIS BILL THANK YOU VERY MUCH WHILE MANY OF THE DETAILS OF THE FUNDING ALLOCATION PLAN WILL BE A DANCER WAS SUBSEQUENT PROCESS I ASK I URGE THAT HESE FUNDS GET OUT TO OUR COMMUNITIES. AS SOON AS POSSIBLE- THEY SURELY CANNOT WAIT TILL UNTIL NOVEMBER. ADDITIONALLY THIS TRAILER BILL INCREASES THE FEES ON CRUDE OIL OR PETROLEUM. PRODUCTS AND EXPANSIVENESS TO RENEWABLE FUEL. WE CANNOT CONTINUE TO INCREASE THE GAS TAXES IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND THEY'RE FULL- I CANNOT VOTE FOR THE BILL TODAY BUT I AM GRATEFUL FOR THE GOOD PARTS IN IT- IN IN IN THIS BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR NELSON. NOT A PRESIDENT COLLEAGUES MY REASON FOR A NO VOTE ON THIS BILL. IS A PRODUCT OF INCREASINGLY THE LEGISLATURE CEDING ITS AUTHORITY OR THE AUTHORITY OF THE PEOPLE THAT ELECTED US. TO THE GOVERNOR. AND AS I UNDERSTAND IT THIS BILL. THE EXPENDITURE OF THESE FUNDS ARE SUBJECT TO THE DETERMINATION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT QUOTE THEY ARE NEEDED. MY THOUGHT IS WHEN THIS LEGISLATURE ACTS DEALS DONE. AND I'M NOT WILLING. TO SEE THAT AUTHORITY. THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH PARTICULARLY IN LIEU OF WHAT IN LIGHT OF WHAT'S HAPPENED IN THE LAST YEAR. MORE SUBSTANTIAL FUNDS WERE NOT SPEND. TO CLEAN UP THE FORCE IN THE WILDLANDS THE PRODUCT OF THAT. AND THE CONSEQUENCES ARE PAID BY THE PEOPLE THAT WE REPRESENT WHOSE PROPERTY. LIVE OR DESTROYED BY THESE FIRES THAT CONTINUE MY POINT IS I DON'T LIKE GIVING THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH THAT IS FORTY THUS I WILL BE A NOBLE. ALL RIGHT SEEING NO OTHER COMMENTS OR- MIKE SEVEN WE WILL MOVE TO AB ONE FIFTY THREE THE CHILD WELFARE- IN SOCIAL SERVICES TRAILER BILL GO HEAD DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. ACTUALLY WHAT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND AB ONE FIFTY THREE- AND THAT SOCIAL SERVICES TRAILER BILL THIS BILL AS PART OF THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO BUDGET PACKAGE MAKES STATUTORY CHANGES TO IMPLEMENT THE BUDGET ACT SPECIFICALLY THE BILL INCLUDES PROVISIONS PERTAINING TO CHILD WELFARE SERVICES ADMINISTERED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES INCLUDING.

BECAUSE INIYA- I SAID THIS SIZE MADE THIS COMMENT IN THE BEGINNING BUT I AM VERY VERY PLEASED TO SEE THE PROVISIONS THAT ARE SUPPORTING OUR FOSTER YOUTH INCLUDING INCREASED PAYMENT TO OUR FOSTER FAMILIES BUT ESPECIALLY THE ELIMINATION THE ENDING OF SENDING OUR USED OUT OF STATE FACILITIES SO I'M REALLY PLEASED TO SEE THAT THE TRAILER BILL. AND WITH THAT WE WILL MOVE ON TO- SKEWS ME BABY ONE FIFTY SIX THE BROADBAND BILL. YES ACTUALLY WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ON EIGHTY ONE FIFTY SIX THE COMMUNICATIONS OUR BROADBAND AVAILABLE- THIS CALL REFLECTS THE STATE BROADBAND PLAN TO ACHIEVE EQUITABLE STATEWIDE ACCESS TO HIGH SPEED BROADBAND INTERNET SERVICE AND PROPOSES A SIX BILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT TO EXPAND BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE AND ENHANCE ACCESS BY CONSTRUCTING AN OPEN ACCESS NETWORK. AND BY FUNDING CONSTRUCTION OF PROJECTS THAT CONNECT UNSERVED HOUSEHOLDS IN REMOTE AREAS TO THAT NETWORK. SPECIFICALLY THIS BILL PROVIDES TWO BILLION TO BE ALLOCATED TO THE EXISTING CALIFORNIA ADVANCED SERVICE FUND OUR CAPITAL PROGRAM TO BUILD BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS FOR COMMUNITIES TO CONNECT TO WHAT IS CALLED THE MIDDLE MILE OR THE STATE INTERNET BACKBONE ONE BILLION WILL BE ALLOCATED TO RURAL AREAS AND ANOTHER BILLION WILL BE ALLOCATED TO. URBAN ON THE BILL PROVIDES FOR THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY AND THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION TO CONTRACT WITH A THIRD PARTY ADMINISTRATOR THIS THIRD PARTY ADMINISTRATOR MUST HAVE DEEP EXPERIENCE IN BUILDING AT WORK AND WORK WITH THE- CALIFORNIA WITH CDT MWC. LOCATE AND DESIGN THE MIDDLE MILE INFRASTRUCTURE PRIMARILY ON STATE OWNED RIGHT OF WAY. THE BILL INCLUDES LANGUAGE THAT SEATS YOU CAN CONTRACT WITH TOP TRENDS FOR THE DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF NEW STATE OWNED. MIDDLE MILE INFRASTRUCTURE. INCLUDES A POSITION AT THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY SERVICES IN THE PRIMARY POINT OF CONTACT. AS WELL AS ACCOUNTABILITY AND REPORTING LANGUAGE INCLUDING ESTABLISHING A BROADBAND ADVISORY COMMITTEE- WHICH WILL BE ESTABLISHED COMPOSED OF REPRESENTATIVES FROM C. T. QC CALTRANS THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THE GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS AGENCY. AND FOR ACTIVE MEMBERS APPOINTED BY THE ASSEMBLY AND SENATE. OTHER BROADBAND PLANS THAT ARE NECESSARY FOR THE STATE. AND ARE INCLUDED IN THE B. B. J. AS I PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED THAT THOSE FUNDS INCLUDE THREE POINT TWO FIVE BILLION TO BUILD A STATE ON. OPEN ACCESS MIDDLE MILE- THE TWO BILLION TO FUND THE LAST MILE IS INCLUDED IN THE STRUGGLE- SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION FOR A LOAN LOSS RESERVE ACCOUNTS WITH THE CALIFORNIA ADVANCED SERVICE FUND TO HELP LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FOR NONPROFIT. ORGANIZATIONS SECURE FINANCING FOR CONSTRUCTION OF LAST MILE BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE. AND WITH THAT I AM HAPPY TO RESPOND TO ANY COMMITTEE QUESTION. THREE ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS ARE BROADBAND YES SENATOR DOLLY. WHAT SORRY MADAM CHAIR TERE'S ONLY TWO OF THESE BILLS I REALLY WANT TO FOCUS IN ON AND WE'VE ALREADY TALKED ABOUT FIRE AND THE NEXT ONE IS BROADBAND SO. MY QUESTION IN MY DISTRICT A HUNDRED THIS IS THE NOT A LOT OF DETAIL AT LEAST I COULD FIND IN THIS. ABOUT ACTUALLY HOW THIS IS GONNA WORK- I UNDERSTAND THAT THE. THE UTILITIES ARE. NOT OUR FRIENDS THEY DON'T USE OUR RESOURCES AND THEY DON'T HOOK UP PEOPLE AND THEY ONLY GO WHERE THEY CAN MAKE MONEY AND SO I UNDERSTAND WHAT THE PROCESS HERE IS JUST AS FAR AS- TRYING TO. DO SOMETHING THAT ACTUALLY SERVES THE PEOPLE OF MY DISTRICT A HUNDRED BY MEGABYTES PER SECOND DOWNLOAD IS FAR MORE THAN MOST PEOPLE ACTUALLY HAVE. IN THIS BILL THAT'S GOING TO BE THE STANDARD FOR UNDER ORDERS. FOR SERVER UNDERSERVED TWENTY FIVE THREE SEEMS MORE LIKE AN ACTOR STANDARD FOR TRULY ON UNDER SERVED. FOR THE LAST MILE RULE FUNDING FORMULA- WAS A HUNDRED. MEGABYTES PER SECOND THE THRESHOLD CHOSEN FOR PRIORITIZING DISTRIBUTION OF THAT ONE HUNDRED BILLION AND NOT THE TWENTY FIVE THREE. SO I THINK THIS IS GONNA BE THE RITUALLY UNDERSERVED ARE GONNA TRY TO MEET A HIGHER STANDARD THAN WHAT. A STANDARD OF TWENTY FIVE THREE WOULD BE SO CAN YOU KIND OF GIVE ME SOME. THOUGHT PROCESS ABOUT HOW YOU GOT. TO THAT. CALCULATION. ALI I WILL TURN THE QUESTION OVER TO ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES- WHO'S BEEN WORKING ON BROADBAND. YOUR FINANCE AND- THE SO AS IT IS I THINK- THIS IS ALREADY NOTED- THE MAJORITY OF THE FUNDING FOR THIS. PROPOSAL COMES FROM THE ARC OF FUNDS AND SO- TO A CERTAIN EXTENT SUCCESS SO THEY HAVE THE HUNDRED DOWN CERTAINLY IS PART OF THE- WHAT'S THE FEDERAL BIKE US TO PURSUE- BUT IN GENERAL- YOU KNOW WORKING WITH- YEAH. THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION AND- AND YOU KNOW OTHER INDUSTRY EXPERTS A HUNDRED- HUNDRED DOWN IS- THAT SAID IT'S A GOOD FUTURE PROOF MEASURE- AND IT'S AND IT'S SOMETHING THE STOCKMARKET TECHNOLOGICALLY ACHIEVABLE. SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT- MMHM WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE WORK OF COURSE BUT THE MIDDLE MILE AND LAST MILE AND SO- BUT THE TARGET REALLY IS- TO IDENTIFY FIRST TO THOSE WHO ARE ON THE SERVER AND SO REFERENCE TO TWENTY FIVE SIX AND IF IT IS THAT- THAT'S A SERVICE THAT'S NOT FAST ENOUGH TO ALLOW FOR- YOU MULTIPLE USERS THE WAY THAT I THINK PEOPLE IT'S NOW BECOME- USED TO R. AND HAD TO GET USED TO. THE CODE AND EVERYTHING AND SO THE IDEA FOR THE TWENTY FIVE DOWN IS THAT- ANYTHING BELOW THAT IS NOT. IT'S NOT FUN OR NOT AND SO AS FUND PROJECTS WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. THE PROJECTS ARE ABLE TO OPERATE AT THE HUNDRED LEVEL. BUT I WOULD JUST SHARE WITH YOU THAT IS AN AREA I'VE WORKED A LOT AND- A HUNDRED MEGABYTES PER SECOND VERSUS TWENTY FIVE SO THAT MEANS THAT ANYBODY THAT HAS TWENTY FIVE OR- OR IS UNDER A HUNDRED. IS CONSIDERED UNDERSERVED SO THAT MEANS THAT THEY HAVE SOMETHING IF THEY IF THEY'RE- TWENTY FIVE OR- ABOVE IF YOU'RE TWENTY FIVE BELOW IF YOU HAVE NOTHING. HE WOULD BE HAPPY TO HAVE TWENTY FIVE THREE AND THAT'S MY POINT IS THAT MOST THIS MONEY'S GONNA GO TO AREAS THAT. R. HAVE SERVICE BUT JUST NOT A HUNDRED. AND THAT THAT'S GOING TO CARVE OUT A WHOLE BUNCH OF PEOPLE IN IN VERY IN AREAS WHERE THEY DON'T HAVE IT SO I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THAT THAT POLICY AND HOW IT GETS HOW IT PLAYS OUT WHEN WE EXPANDED I UNDERSTAND WE GOT TO GET THIS ON THE GROUND WE GOT TO GET IT DONE BECAUSE THIS IS. FEDERAL DOLLARS- SO I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING WE SHOULD LOOK AT MAYBE IN SOME FOLLOW UP LANGUAGE BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO MISS A WHOLE BUNCH OF PEOPLE THAT ARE NOT SERVED AND WE'RE GONNA SPEED UP PEOPLE'S SERVICES THAT ALREADY ARE SERVED. I THINK THAT'S A PROBLEM WITH THIS PIECE A LETTER WITH THIS PROPOSAL THE OTHER THING I WANT TO ASK ABOUT IS THE MIDDLE MILE. WHEN YOU WHEN YOU WHEN THAT WHISTLE GONNA BE A GOVERNMENT RAN. INTERNET SERVICE THIS IS THIS IS DONE BY THE FUNDS ARE COMING FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND FROM THE STATE FUNDS THAT WE'RE PUTTING IN. AND ALL THE MONOPOLIES THAT WE HAVE THE FIVE BIG MONOPOLIES THAT DON'T HELP US OUT WHICH IS EIGHTEEN T. VERIZON- SPRINT. AND ALL THE BIG UTILITIES OUT THERE THAT THAT HAVE ALL THIS INFRASTRUCTURE. AND WE'RE GONNA PUT THE MIDDLE MILE IN BUT WHO WERE WHO WERE GONNA HOOK UP TO. AND WE'RE GONNA TRY TO HOOK UP TO THEIR- TO THEIR SOURCE. AND THEN OFFERED. TO THEIR CUSTOMERS I DON'T BELIEVE THEY'RE GOING TO BE WANTING TO PARTICIPATE. IN LETTING US GET ON THIS BACKBONE IT'S THE BACKBONE IS NOT OWNED BY THE PUBLIC IT'S OWNED BY PRIVATE COMPANIES AND IF WE'RE GONNA PUT THE MIDDLE MILE AND THEN TRY TO HOOK UP TO THAT AND GO OUT AND SERVE UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES I DON'T SEE WHAT THE INCENTIVE FOR THEM TO BE ABLE. TO LET US COOK IN THE BACK OF THE HOUSE THAT GONNA WORK. YES SO- PART OF THE TROUBLE DOES IS IT PROVIDES FOR A- THIRD PARTY ADMINISTRATOR THAT HAS- BROAD EXPERIENCE IN THE IN THIS- IN THIS INDUSTRY- AND SO- BUT BUT THE INTENT IS REALLY TO- TO BUILD OUR TRIP TO- TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE AN OPEN ACCESS- LITTLE MILD THAT DOES THAT TIES INTO THE BAN LAST MILE. COMMUNITIES CAN TIE INTO. AND SO- THE- SO THE- INDUSTRY AND THAT THAT THEY CURRENTLY HAS- INFRASTRUCTURE THERE- CERTAINLY WE WANT TO BUILD SOMETHIN WE DON'T NEED A BILL RIGHT AND SO- THE- WE WOULD WORK WITH INDUSTRY WE WOULD WORK THROUGH A THIRD PARTY ADMINISTRATOR- AND THEN TRY TO USE WHAT'S AVAILABLE WHO CAN GET LONG TERM ACCESS TO IT- BUT TO THE EXTENT THAT- THAT WERE UNABLE TO GET THAT THEN WE WOULD NEED TO- THEN. WE NEED TO GO AHEAD AND BUILD- BUILD OUT THE SYSTEM THERE SO THAT IN THE END WE HAVE A MIDDLE MILE SYSTEM THAT REACHES ALL OF THE COMMUNITIES IN THE STATE. WELL I WOULD SAY THAT. WE'RE GONNA PUT MIDDLE MILE. RIGHT ALONGSIDE A PRIVATE PROVIDERS MIDDLE MILE. I HAVE IT THROUGH ALL THROUGHOUT MY DISTRICT AND SOMETHING I'VE BEEN VERY FRUSTRATED WITH THE UTILITIES IS I'VE SAID IT THREE TIMES ON THIS FLOOR WE HAVE THE I. FIVE QUARTER GOES ALL THE WAY FROM CALIFORNIA TO WASHINGTON AND THERE'S FIBER LAID. LOTS OF FIBER LAID RIGHT UP THROUGH THERE AND A LOT OF IT ALONG THE RAILROAD LINES AS WELL. AND THEY DON'T ALLOW ME TO TAP INTO IT SO THEY'RE THEY'RE GONNA ALLOW YOU TO TAP INTO THAT SOMEWHERE. TO HOOK UP MY COMMUNITY BECAUSE YOU HAVE MIDDLE MAN THAT'S THERE BUT YOU GOT IT CONNECTED THERE'S BEEN ON RAMP. THERE'S BEEN OFFERING UP. TO GET THE ON RAMP YOU HAVE TO TAKE IT FROM SOMEBODY'S PRIVATE. SOME PRIVATE COMPANIES BACKBONE. THAT'S THE CONCERN I PASSED EARLIER. BUT YOU'RE BASICALLY SAYING WE'RE GONNA BUILD OUR OWN NETWORK RIGHT NEXT TO THEIRS. AND THAT SOMEHOW IS GOING TO SERVE OUR COMMUNITIES. THANK YOU THIRTY DOLLARS SENATOR MCGUIRE. THANK YOU SO MUCH MADAM CHAIR IN ODYSSEY ON THE ISSUE OF BROADBAND. AT FIRST AND FOREMOST I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO OUR COLLEAGUE FROM BEAVER AND- SHARES FRUSTRATION REGARDING A LACK OF ACCESS UP FOR HIGH SPEED INTERNET. I'M A FIRM BELIEVER THAT THIS PANDEMIC IS REALLY SHINE THE SPOTLIGHT. ON THE MASSIVE DISPARITIES THAT EXIST WHETHER IT'S IN A SMALL TOWN IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA- OUR INNER CITIES IN DOWNTOWN LA WHEN IT COMES TO THE ISSUE OF INTERNET. MILLIONS ACROSS THE STATE ARE THE ARE ON THE WRONG SIDE. OF THE DIGITAL DIVIDE. AND I'M A FIRM BELIEVER THIS PROJECT'S LEGACY. WILL BE IT'S THE LARGEST ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVE THAT HAS BEEN LAUNCHED. IN PARTICULAR FOR RURAL CALIFORNIA. IN OVER A CENTURY. SO BOTTOM LINE IS THIS I SHARE. THE GOOD SENATORS FRUSTRATION. ABOUT MIDDLE MILE BUT HERE'S THE TRUTH IN RURAL CALIFORNIA WHEN IT COMES TO MIDDLE MILE. DIRT LITERALLY THOUSANDS OF MIDDLE MILE LINES THAT RUN THROUGH RURAL CALIFORNIA. THE INCUMBENTS ONLY ACCESS TO THAT MIDDLE MILE. THEY FORCE SOME OF THE POOREST COMMUNITIES IN AMERICA TO PAY EXORBITANT FEES TO TAP INTO A- IN THOSE COMMUNITIES SIMPLY CAN'T AFFORD IT. WHICH MEANS. WE HAVE A HUGE SWATHS OF THE STATE THAT ARE UNDERSERVED WHEN IT COMES TO NOT JUST ON NOT NOT JUST HI SPEED INTERNET BUT EVEN DIAL UP. SO IS IT RIDICULOUS THAT THIS STATE IS GOING TO HAVE TO BUILD A SECOND LINE REDUNDANT LYING NEXT TO INCUMBENT LYING YOU'RE RIGHT IT IS BUT WE'RE NOT IN IT FOR THE PROFIT. THIS STATE IS IN IT FOR THE PEOPLE. AND MORE COMPETITION WILL BRING DOWN THE PRICES FOR EVERYONE IN THE STATE. THERE'S THREE POINT TWO FIVE BILLION FOR MIDDLE MILE THAT HIGH CAPACITY FIBER LINE THAT IS THE HIGHWAY- OF WHAT WILL BE ONE OF AMERICA'S LARGEST BROADBAND PROJECTS- I KNOW THAT THE GOVERNOR THE LEGISLATURE IS VERY FOCUSED ON BRINGING ON AN EXPERIENCED NONPROFIT TO BE ABLE TO OVERSEE IT. AND RIGHTFULLY SO IT IS GOING TO HAVE A WORSE FOR STRATEGY WE HAVE TO FOCUS ON THOSE WHO DON'T HAVE SERVICE FIRST THEN GO TO LOWES WHO ARE UNDERSERVED. IN THE REASON WHY WE HAVE TO HAVE TWO POINT SEVEN FIVE BILLION FOR LAST MILE IS TO ALLOW FOR COMMUNITIES TO BE ABLE TO BUILD OUT THEIR OWN SYSTEMS THREE TO CONNECT TO THAT NEW. MIDDLE MILE THAT WILL BE BUILT BY THE PUBLIC. I'LL SAY THIS. THIS BUDGET HAS CHANGED SINCE CHAIR SKINNER AND IN PARTICULAR- TO MAC INTO SPEAKER RENDON GOT INVOLVED. ON THE LAST MILE ALONE. THERE IS IT LEASED OUT OF THAT TWO POINT TWO FIVE BILLION AT LEAST ONE BILLION WILL GO TO RURAL COMMUNITIES THIS IS A GAME CHANGER. FOR LAST MILE RIGHT NOW THERE ARE ZERO DOLLARS THAT. TRINIDAD OR CRESCENT CITY. WEAVERVILLE- HAYFORK CAN US ZERO DOLLARS AVAILABLE FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO BUILD OUT THEIR OWN BROADBAND. NUMBER TWO. WE'VE INCREASED THE LOAN LOSS AMOUNT FROM TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION IT'S TWO TO SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION IN THIS BUDGET WHAT IS THE LONE LOSS AMOUNT IT WILL ALLOW RURAL CITIES AND COUNTIES IN UNDER SERVED. METROPOLITAN AREAS THE DEAL WITH THE BOND AGAINST THE SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION TO BE ABLE TO BUILD OUT THEIR SYSTEM. IT'S A GAME CHANGER. THERE'S GOING TO BE FIFTY MILLION. IN AN UPCOMING. ALLOCATION FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE GRANTS FOR RURAL COMMUNITIES THE BILL TO COVER ENVIRONMENTAL AND ENGINEERING WE'RE LEARNING FROM MISTAKES IN THE PAST WITH LARGE BUDGET PUBLIC PROJECTS. IN DOING A WAIVER FOR SEQUEL. I'M WITHIN THE CALTRANS RIGHT AWAY. WE SHOULD BE APPLAUDING THIS EFFORT RIGHT NOW- THE LAST THING I'LL SAY IS THIS. THE GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS NOT JUST TO CONNECT. PEOPLE BUT IT'S ALSO TO CONNECT OUR MOST CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE THAT MAKES OUR COMMUNITIES THRIVE IT'S GONNA CONNECT FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTERS. RURAL HEALTH CENTERS HOSPITALS THANK GOD K. TWELVE PUBLIC SCHOOLS THERE ARE COMMUNITIES ON THE NORTH COAST WHERE KIDS WERE SPENDING. TWO HUNDRED TO THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS EVERY FREAKING MONTH. THE ACCESS SATELLITE INTERNET. IT'S UNACCEPTABLE AND WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO RELY ON THE PRIVATE INDUSTRY TO DO GOOD INPUT GOOD OVER PROFIT WE'RE GONNA BE WAITING ANOTHER FIFTY YEARS.
