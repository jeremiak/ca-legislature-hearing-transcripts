THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT SENATORS. I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT SB FIVE THREE FORTY THREE THE BILL THAT REMOVES PROVISIONS IN THE LAW THAT ALLOWS KAISER PERMANENTE A TO REPORT. LESS INFORMATION TO REGULATORS AND OTHER HEALTH PLANS AND HOSPITALS IN THE STATE. TRANSPARENCY LAWS LIKE GREAT REVIEW IN HOSPITAL FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES WERE CREATED TO HELP PURCHASERS AND REGULATORS MONITOR ACOSTA DRIVE HEALTH INSURANCE PREMIUM RATES. AS HEALTHCARE COSTS CONTINUE TO RISE POLICYMAKERS PURCHASERS IN CONSUMERS SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO THE SAME INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT IS DRIVING COST INCREASES AT KAISER IS HEY HAVE ABOUT EVERY OTHER HOSPITAL AND HEALTH PLAN. AS I STATED IN THE HEALTH COMMITTEE I AM COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH KAISER ON REASONABLE AMENDMENTS TO ACCOMMODATE LEGITIMATE BARRIERS TO REPORTING THIS INFORMATION. BY STAFF AND SPONSORS HAVE HAD A GOOD MEETING WITH KAISER EARLY LAST WEEK AND WE LOOK CONTINUE FOR TO CONTINUE TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS WITH THEM AS PART OF THE ASSEMBLY HEALTH COMMITTEE NEGOTIATIONS. IF THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD FROM THIS FLOOR BUT THAT EXPECT WE ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE SENATOR LEYVA. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS I RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS BILL ARE I LOVE THIS BILL AND I LOVE KAISER BUT WHAT I FELT VERY FRUSTRATING AS A NEGOTIATOR IS THAT WHEN WE WERE TRYING TO SET RATES. OF FOR OUR MEMBERS IN HEALTHCARE KAISER WOULD ALWAYS REFER TO A BLACK BOX AND WE WOULD ASK THEM WELL WHY ARE YOU CHARGING THE RATES THAT YOU'RE CHARGING. THEY WOULD SAY YOU KNOW ISN'T IT THE EXPERIENCE RATE TO HAVE MORE OR LESS MEMBERS WERE THERE CATASTROPHIC ILLNESS WHAT IS DRIVING THE COST WE COULD NEVER GET A STRAIGHT ANSWER OTHER THAN IT WAS IN THE BLACK BOX. WHAT MADE IT VERY DIFFICULT FOR US TO DO OUR JOB TO NOT ONLY NEGOTIATE WITH THEM BUT NEGOTIATE WITH OTHER HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS SO I WANT THINK CENTER PAN FOR BRING IT FORWARD AND LOOK FORWARD TO SUPPORTING IT TODAY? THANK YOU ANY ADDITIONAL DESCRIPTION DEBATE ON THIS ITEM.

SENATE BILL TWO NINETY THREE BY SENATOR SKINNER AN ACT RELATING TO INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCING DISTRICTS INNER SKINNER WHEN YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT MEMBERS SB. TWO NINETY THREE WOULD ALLOW THE CITY OF OAKLAND TO FORM. AN INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCING DISTRICT. TO HELP SUPPORT THE FINANCING OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDED FOR PROPOSED STADIUM PROJECT. V.. ANY FINANCING THAT EMANATES FROM THE DISTRICT WOULD NOT BE USED FOR THE ACTUAL STADIUM ITSELF. THAT IS GOING TO BE PRIVATELY FINANCED BUT RATHER FOR THE OTHER TRANSPORTATION AND OTHER INFRASTRUCTURE THE MAY BE NEEDED AT THE SITE WHICH IS THE HOWARD TERMINAL SOME DISTANCE FROM THE PORT OF OAKLAND -- SO IT ALLOWS THE CITY TO DO SO. CHANCE THE TERM FOR THE TAX INCREMENTS TO FORTY FIVE YEARS OUR CURRENT INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCING DISTRICT. TIME PERIOD IS THIRTY YEARS THIS WOULD ALLOW IT TO GO FOR FORTY FIVE YEARS -- STAND IT. ALLOWS FOR A PROTEST PROCESS RATHER THAN THE VOTER APPROVAL THAT'S REQUIRED FOR OTHER FINANCING DISTRICTS. AND PART OF THE MOTIVATION IS THAT IS THAT THIS IS AN AREA THAT HAS VERY FEW RESIDENTS -- FIVE AGREED TO TAKE AMENDMENTS TO ENSURE THAT OUR BIG CONSERVATION AND DEVELOPMENT COMMISSION IN OUR STATE LANDS COMMISSION. PART THERE ARE AUTHORITY IN THIS MATTER OR NOT SUPERSEDED. BUT WE WERE UNABLE TO TAKE THOSE BEFORE IT WENT TO THE FLOOR BUT WE WILL BE SO WE WILL BE ENSURING THAT BOTH STATE LANDS AND BE CDC WHICH HAVE AUTHORITY -- BECAUSE THIS IS ADJACENT TO THE BAY THAT THEIR AUTHORITY IS COMPLETELY RESPECTED WITHIN THIS BILL.

CONCERN ON ALLOWING THE CREATION OF AN INDEPENDENT INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCING DISTRICT. WHICH IS SORT OF REDEVELOPMENT LIKE VEHICLE -- AND I'M WILL CONCERN THAT EXCLUDES VOTER INVOLVEMENT ON DEBT ISSUANCE. BUT WE'VE SEEN SOME. SUCCESSFUL [inaudible] BASEBALL STADIUMS -- IN THE PAST I WAS THERE FOR THE FIRST YEAR OF COURSE FIELD IN DENVER AND IT WAS FULL -- PETCO IS DOING WELL IN SAN DIEGO BUT OAKLAND NEEDS A A SHOT IN THE ARM. AND IT NEEDS AN ECONOMIC BOOST TO IMPROVE ITS ITS ITS. DISTRESSFUL A BALANCE SHEET I'M NOT SURE MOVING A BASEBALL STADIUM WILL DO THE TRICK BUT I SURE HOPE IT DOES. BUT IF IT DOESN'T I APOLOGIZE IN ADVANCE FOR ENCOURAGING AN AYE VOTE ON SB. TWO NINE THREE ANY ADDITION IS KOSHER DEBATE ON THIS ITEM. HERE IN CHINO AND CENTER SKINNER WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. I'M YES THANK YOU -- ARE JUST A LITTLE REMINDER THAT OUR AND I'M NOT INDICATING THAT THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER IMPLIED THIS BUT OUR LEGISLATION REGARDING THE INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCING DISTRICTS. DOES NOT TAKE ANY PROPERTY TAX INCREMENTS THAT WOULD GO TO OUR SCHOOLS -- SO IT'S DIFFERENT THAN REDEVELOPMENT IN THAT REGARD.

SENATOR HILL THANK YOU BACK THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER PRESIDENT SB TWO TWENTY TWO IS A REINTRODUCTION OF SB FOURTEEN TWENTY SEVEN FROM LAST YEAR. WHICH WAS APPROVED BY THE LEGISLATURE WITH BROAD BIPARTISAN SUPPORT. SB TWO TWENTY TWO WOULD WERE PROTECTED VETERANS AND MILITARY PERSONNEL FROM HOUSING DISCRIMINATION. AND ENSURE THAT LANDLORDS CANNOT DENY HOMELESS VETERANS HOUSING BASED SOLELY ON THE FACT THAT THEY RECEIVE A RENTAL HOUSING VOUCHER. US VETERANS AND THOSE CURRENTLY SERVING IN THE ARMED FORCES ARE PROTECTED FROM EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION BY THE CALIFORNIA FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING ACT. HOWEVER THE LAW DOES NOT SPECIFICALLY INCLUDE VETERANS OR MILITARY PERSONNEL AMONG THOSE WHO ARE PROTECTED FROM HOUSING DISCRIMINATION. ALMOST EVERY OTHER PROTECTED CLASS IN THE FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING ACT IS PROTECTED IN BOTH EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING DISCRIMINATION STATUTES AS BE. TWENTY TWENTY THE TWO TWENTY TWO WOULD ADDRESS THIS GAP BY ADDING VETERANS AND MILITARY PERSONNEL AS A PROTECTED CLASS IN STATUTES RELATING TO HOUSING DISCRIMINATION THE BILL WILL ALSO ENSURE OUR HEROES ARE NOT DISCRIMINATED AGAINST IN HOUSING. AND ARE NOT DENIED HOUSING BECAUSE OF HOW THEY PAY THEIR RENT OR VETERANS AND MILITARY PERSONNEL ALREADY FACE SIGNIFICANT HOUSING CHALLENGES THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE TO WORRY.

THERE THE PERMIT PROCESS FOR THESE PROGRAMS TO BE TREATED THE SAME FOR A SMALL OR LARGE AND OF COURSE LARGE IS STILL A VERY LIMITED NUMBER BUT FOR THESE TYPE OF HOMES. IT ALSO ENSURES THAT CHILD CARE pIS ALLOWED IN APARTMENTS AND CONDOS WHICH IS ALREADY EXISTS IN THE LAW BUT THERE'S BEEN SOME AMBIGUITY.

SENATOR JONES THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT A SPLIT DOLLAR LIFE INSURANCE POLICY ALLOWS THE COST AND BENEFIT OF A PERMANENT LIFE INSURANCE POLICY TO BE SHARED. CALIFORNIA LAW ALREADY ALLOWS NONPROFITS TO OFFER THESE UNIQUE POLICIES TO THEIR OFFICERS. AS AN EMPLOYMENT BENEFIT THAT ENDS UP BEING COST TO NEUTRAL TO THE NONPROFIT. SENATE BILL FIVE FORTY SLIGHTLY ADJUST THE VALUE THAT IS REQUIRED TO BE HELD A SECURITY ON A SPLIT DOLLAR LIFE INSURANCE POLICY UNDER LOAN REGIME. TO THE DEATH BENEFIT OR THE CASH SURRENDER VALUE OR BOTH. THIS SMALL CHANGE SERVES AS A RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION TOOL FOR NON PROFITS. BECAUSE IT ALLOWS THE OFFICER TO UTILIZE SOME OF THE CASH VALUE OF THE POLICY WHILE ENSURING THERE IS ENOUGH VALUE LEFT TO REPAIR THE NONPROFIT FOR ANY COSTS INCURRED. I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ANY ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION AND DEBATE SENATOR MITCHELL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- MISTER PRESIDENT ON AS I SHARED WITH MISTER JONES AND COMMITTEE I LAID OFF IN COMMITTEE AND I'LL BE VOTING NO TODAY -- I APPRECIATED THE BALL THE BILL WAS AMENDED IN BANKING BUT IT.

I APPRECIATE OF THE THE AUTHOR FEELS THAT -- SOME OF THE HIGHLY COMPENSATED EMPLOYEES ABOUT THE LARGER NONPROFITS LIKE HOSPITALS ARE UNIVERSITIES HAVE DIFFICULTY RECRUITING THAT THAT'S NOT MY EXPERIENCE NOR IS IT THE HOLES. IN THE NONPROFIT SECTOR ASSOCIATION THE CONCERN WITH THE BILL IS IT APPEARS TO WEEK IN LOSS AGAINST SELF DEALING. AGAIN IN ORDER PROVIDE A SMALL NUMBER OF NONPROFITS ABILITY TO PAY HIGHLY COMPENSATED EMPLOYEES MORE WITHOUT VIOLATING OTHER RESTRICTIONS ON HIGH COMPENSATION AGAIN. I DON'T THINK THIS IS A NECESSARY TOOL TO ALLOW NONPROFITS TO RECRUIT HIGHLY HIGHLY COMPENSATED INDIVIDUALS AND FOR THOSE REASONS I WON'T BE SUPPORTING SB FIVE FORTY TODAY.

AS YOU KNOW MAY AS MENTAL HEALTH MONTH. AS AN IMPORTANT TIME. TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT ONE IN FIVE U. S. ADULTS OF WE'VE ALREADY HEARD TODAY IS LIVING WITH SOME SORT OF MENTAL ILLNESS. MANY PEOPLE WITH SERIOUS CHRONIC MENTAL ILLNESS REQUIRE TREATMENT WITH ANTI -- PSYCHOTIC MEDICINE AND MEDICATIONS. WHILE ONGOING TREATMENT. WITH THESE MEDICATIONS CAN BE VERY HELPFUL. AND EVEN LIFESAVING FOR MANY. BUT IT ALSO LEADS TO TAR DIVE THIS COULD END UP. TV AS IT'S KNOWN IS A MOVEMENT DISORDER. THAT IS CHARACTERIZED BY RANDOM INVOLUNTARY UNCONTROLLED MOVEMENTS. OF THE FACE AND BODY AND MUSCLES THROUGHOUT A PERSON'S BODY. THE SHAKING OF THE BODY SOMETIMES IT MAY IMPACT THE MUSCLES ASSOCIATED WITH WALKING SPEECH EIGHTEEN AND EVEN BREATHING. TV CAN DEVELOP MONTHS YEARS OR EVEN DECADES AFTER PERSON STARTS TAKING THESE MEDICATIONS. AND EVEN AFTER THEY'VE DISCONTINUED THIS CONTINUED FOR SOME TIME. NOT ALL OF THESE PATIENTS DEVELOPED TODAY BUT IT IS DEVELOPS AND IT IS OFTEN PERMANENT. PATIENTS SUFFERING FROM TV OFTEN SUFFER EMBARRASSMENT DUE TO ABNORMAL INVOLUNTARY MOVEMENTS WHICH LEADS THEM TO WITHDRAW FROM SOCIETY. THESE ARE FOLKS TRIED TO LIVE AND FUNCTION IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND UNFORTUNATELY THE LACK OF AWARENESS OF THE DISEASE CREATES A STIGMA. THE MORE WE CAN RISE AND TO THE AWARENESS OF THIS ILLNESS. AND MORE ISSUES PERTAIN TO MENTAL HEALTH COME FORTH THE MORE WE CAN MOVE. THIS TERRIBLE SIGMA AND GET AROUND IT. TV IS OFTEN. UNRECOGNIZED WITH PATIENTS SUFFERING FROM THE ILLNESS AREN'T CALMLY DOT MISDIAGNOSIS BUT THERE ARE SOME HOPE. AFTER SEVERAL YEARS OF RESEARCH.

THIS MEASURE LADIES AND GENTLEMAN WOULD MAKE OUR CIVIL JUSTICE SYSTEM MORE EQUITABLE BY PUTTING AN END TO THIS REPUGNANT AND WIDESPREAD PRACTICE THAT'S HAPPENING IN COURT ROOMS RIGHT NOW.

AS THE ONE EIGHTY REQUIRES THAT ALL SELLERS OF GENE THERAPY KIDS KNOWN AS DO IT YOURSELF CHRIS FOR KIDS MUST INCLUDE A NOTICE BEFORE PURCHASE AND A WARNING LABEL. ON THE PRODUCT TO NOTIFY CUSTOMERS THAT THESE KIDS ARE NOT FOR SELF ADMINISTRATION. CRISPER CAST NINE IS A NEW GENE EDITING TECHNOLOGY THAT OFFERS THE POTENTIAL FOR SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT OVER OTHER GENE. EDITING TECHNOLOGIES AND EASE OF USE AFTER SEEING COST. AND CRISPER IS AN ACRONYM FOR CLUSTER REGULARLY INITIALLY SHORT PALINDROMIC REPEATS WHICH ARE UNIQUE DNA SEQUENCES FOUND IN SOME BACTERIA. AND OTHER MICROORGANISMS ACCORDING TO A REPORT BY THE CONGRESSIONAL RESEARCH SERVICE ON CRISPER TECHNOLOGY MANY EXPERTS CLAIM THAT CHRIS FOR CAST NINE TECHNOLOGY MAY OFFER THE MEANS VERS PREVENT TREAT OR CURE. MEDICAL CONDITIONS SUCH AS DIABETES MALARIA SICKLE CELL DISEASE AND MORE HOWEVER. THERE ARE CONCERNS WITHIN THE SCIENCE COMMUNITY ON THE AMATEUR USE OF THIS INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGY. THE FOR THE AFFORDABILITY AND ACCESSIBILITY THESE PRODUCTS HAVE BENEFITTED EDUCATIONAL AND INSTITUTIONS BUT CONCERNS REMAIN ABOUT THE IMPACT ON CONSUMER SAFETY. AND PUBLIC HEALTH THERE HAVE BEEN INSTANCES CAUGHT ON VIDEO OF INDIVIDUALS INJECTING THEMSELVES WITH CRISPER CAST NINE ENERGY. AERIALS WITH THE INTENTION OF EDITING THEIR PHYSIOLOGY. SINCE THIS IS STILL A VERY NEW TECHNOLOGY THERE ARE NEW HEALTH RISKS EMERGING AS WE GO FORWARD. SEVERAL ARTICLES HAVE EVEN CITED POTENTIAL CANCER RISKS. THERE ARE CASES IN WHICH WE SEARCH TEAMS HAVE RECREATED EXTINCT STRAINS OF VIRAL DISEASES FROM SCRATCH. THE UNITED STATES FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION HAS ALREADY STATED THAT THE SALE OF GENE THERAPY PRODUCTS WITH THE INTENT. OF SELF ADMINISTRATION IS GET A IS AGAINST THE LAW AND THE DEPARTMENT STATES CONCERNS ABOUT SAFETY RISKS. CONSERVE CONSUMER PROTECTION WHEN PURCHASING THESE. DO IT YOURSELFERS FOR KIDS SB ONE EIGHTY REQUIRES THAT ALL SELLERS PROVIDE A NOTICE. ON THEIR WEBSITE THAT IS DISPLAYED FOR THE CONSUMER PRIOR TO THE POINT OF SALE AS WELL AS THE LABEL ON THE PACKAGE CONTAINING. THE CHRIS FOR KIDS SAYING THAT THESE CHRIS FOR KIDS ARE NOT INTENDED FOR SELF ADMINISTRATION WE NEED TO BE PROACTIVE WHEN IT COMES NEW TECHNOLOGIES RATHER THAN REACTIVE WHEN SOMEONE GETS SERIOUSLY HURT.

BELONGS AND LOCAL COMMUNITY EVENTS LOCAL AGENCIES BELONG TO A NUMBER OF JP ACE MANY OF WHICH ADDRESS TECHNICAL ISSUE SUCH AS INSURANCE COVERAGE AND RETAIL ELECTRIC POWER PROCUREMENT. IN LIGHT OF THE MANY MEETINGS OFF ELECTED OFFICIALS ARE REQUIRED TO ATTEND AND THE TECHNICAL ISSUES ADDRESSED BY SOME GPAS MANY SUCH AGREEMENTS PROVIDE FOR THAT LOCAL AGENCY MEMBER OF THE JPA. TO DESIGNATE AN ALTERNATE DIRECTOR THAT IS NOT A MEMBER OF THAT LEGISLATIVE BODY UNFORTUNATELY EXISTING LAW PREVENTS AN ALTERNATE THAT IS NOT A MEMBER OF THE LOCAL LEGISLATIVE BODY FROM PARTICIPATING IN THE JP ACE CLOSE SESSION DISCUSSION. THIS BILL WOULD PERMIT SUCH AN ELECTED ALTERNATES O PARTICIPATE IN THE CLOSED SESSION DISCUSSIONS OF THAT JEEP JPA.
