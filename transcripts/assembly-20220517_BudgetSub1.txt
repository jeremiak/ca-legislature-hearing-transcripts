AS WE HEAD INTO THE LEFT FOR THE FINAL MONTH OF THE BUDGET CYCLE RECOGNIZING THAT THIS WEEK'S HEARINGS MAY BE OUR LAST SUBCOMMITTEE'S HEARINGS I WANT TO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE WHAT I THINK SHOULD BE OUR STATE'S HIGHEST PRIORITIES. IN HEALTH. AS YOU ALL KNOW THE PAST TWO YEARS HAVE BEEN DIFFICULT FOR ALL OF US. MANY OF US HAVE LOST LOVED ONES MANY OF US HAVE BEEN ILL OURSELVES. AND MANY OF OUR COLLEAGUES FRIENDS AND FAMILY ARE SICK TODAY. AND ALL OF US HAVE BATTLED THE STRESS OF ISOLATION DIMINISHED ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE THE FEARS ABOUT THE FUTURE OF COVERT. MOREOVER THE PANDEMIC HAS BROUGHT LONG STANDING HEALTH EQUITY ISSUES INTO STARK RELIEF OUR STATE'S INEQUITIES WERE NOT CREATED BY THE PANDA. BUT THE PANDEMIC HAS HIGHLIGHTED THEM AND ELIMINATED ANY EXCUSES WE MAY HAVE HAD TO NOT ADDRESS THEM GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET DOES JUST THAT AND THEREFORE I WANT TO THANK THE GOVERNOR AND APPLAUD THE A MINUTE ADMINISTRATION FOR A JOB WELL DONE. BUT I ALSO CAME TO THE STATE CAPITOL TO ELEVATE THESE ISSUES. TO BRING TO SPEAK FOR CALIFORNIANS WHOSE VOICES ARE NOT TYPICALLY HEARD HERE AND TO PUSH THE STATE TO DO MORE AND TO DO BETTER. A FEW EXAMPLES. THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. HIS BUDGET PROPOSES HEALTH FOR ALL TO EXPAND MEDICAL ELIGIBILITY TO ALL ELIGIBLE ADULTS REGARDLESS OF IMMIGRATION STATUS YET IT DOES SO ALLOWING TWENTY SIX YEAR OLDS TO LOSE COVERAGE OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS. WE CAN DO BETTER TO MAKE HEALTH CARE MORE AFFORDABLE I ELIMINATING PREMIUMS FOR SELECT POPULATIONS AND MEDICAL. YET IT LEAVES COST SHARING FOR OTHER LOW INCOME MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES. AGAIN WE CAN DO BETTER. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ELIMINATES SOME RECESSION ERA AB NINETY SEVEN RATE REDUCTIONS GET IT LEAVES MANY OTHERS IN PLACE. WE CAN DO BETTER. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSES SOME MODEST RESOURCES FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF NINE EIGHT EIGHT. YET FAILS TO SUPPORT OTHER SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES OR A STATE PLANNING PROCESS WE CAN DO BETTER. FINALLY THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES VARIOUS MODEST INVESTMENTS IN CALIFORNIA'S SENIORS YET FAILS TO MAKE A SERIOUS COMMITMENT TO WHOLESALE REFORM OF OUR NURSING HOME INDUSTRY. WE CAN AND WE MUST DO BETTER. MY COMMITMENT TO ALL OF YOU IS THAT I AND THE LEGISLATURE WILL TAKE THE GOVERNOR'S EXCELLENT BUDGET AND MAKE IT EVEN BETTER. WE WILL PUSH OURSELVES AND OUR STATE TO LIFT UP THE LIVES AND HEALTH OF AS MANY CALIFORNIANS AS POSSIBLE TODAY'S HEARING. I WOULD LIKE TO FIRST WELCOME UP MARK NOONAN DEPUTY LEGISLATIVE ANALYST WITH THE L. A. O. WHO IS GOING TO PROVIDE A HIGH LEVEL OVERVIEW OF THE MAY REVISION. MR NOON. THANKS VERY MUCH I MISTER CHAIR MARK NEWTON WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST OFFICE AND IS THE TERM MENTIONED WE ARE ASKED TO PROVIDE AN HIGH LEVEL OVERVIEW OF THE ALLEY OWES INITIAL TAKE ON THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISION PROPOSAL- YESTERDAY OUR OFFICE RELEASED- OUR INITIAL COMMENTS ON THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. WHICH LARGELY FOCUS ON THE OVERALL STRUCTURE AND BUDGET. IN OVERALL CONDITION OF THE OF THE BUDGET- I KNOW THAT OUR OFFICE IS CURRENTLY ANALYZING THE INDIVIDUAL PROPOSALS AND CERTAINLY AS OUR UNDERSTANDING CONTINUES TO INVOLVE AS WE GET MORE INFORMATION FROM THE ADMINISTRATION. WE WILL BE ADVISING THE LEGISLATURE IN THE COMING DAYS AND WEEKS AND AS ALWAYS HAPPY TO PROVIDE WHATEVER TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE WE CAN PROVIDE- AS THE LEGISLATURE- DELIBERATES ON THE ON THE BUDGET OUR KEY FINDINGS FROM OUR REPORT THAT WAS RELEASED TO YESTERDAY. THE FIRST FINDING. IS THAT THE REVENUE GROWTH HAS BEEN ABSOLUTELY EXTRAORDINARY OVER THE LAST- TWO YEARS. MEANING THAT THE GOVERNOR HAD A VERY LARGE SURPLUS TO ALLOCATE. A FIFTY TWO BILLION DOLLAR GENERAL FUND SURPLUS- AND THEN A THIRTY THREE AND A HALF BILLION DOLLAR SURPLUS WHICH IS IN THE SCHOOL AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE- BUDGET. BUT ONE CAN'T MENTION SURPLUS WITHOUT MENTIONING THE OPERATION OF THE STATE APPROPRIATIONS LIMIT OUR OUR FINDING IS IT CERTAINLY THE SAL STATE APPROPRIATIONS LIMIT CONTINUES TO BE A MAJOR CONSTRAINT ON THE BUDGET WITHOUT GOING INTO ALL THE TECHNICAL MECHANICS OF SOUTH WHICH IS QUITE A QUITE COMPLICATED IT ESSENTIALLY ELIMINATES HOW THE STATE CAN USE REVENUES WHEN REVENUES EXCEED A CERTAIN A CERTAIN LIMIT AND WHEN REVENUES EXCEED THAT LIMIT. THE STATE IS DICTATED IN THE WAYS THEY CAN SPEND FUNDING IT CAN IT CAN SPEND ON TAX REFUNDS OR TAX REBATES PAYMENTS TO SCHOOLS BUT ALSO ON SPENDING THAT IS EXCLUDED FROM THE STATE APPROPRIATIONS LIMIT AND THAT SUCH SPENDING AS SPENDING ON CAPITAL OUTLAY ARE SPENDING ON EMERGENCIES AND THAT SPENDING ON LOCAL SO. SUBVENTIONS TO. I'M TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT OR SO OUR WAYS AND THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISION PROPOSAL CERTAINLY TAKES. ADVANTAGE OF- OF THOSE VARIOUS OBSERVE MEANS. SO OF THAT SURPLUS ABOUT THIRTY NINE BILLION DOLLARS OF A FIFTY TWO BILLION DOLLARS SURPLUS IT IS SPENT TOWARDS MEETING SORT OF WHAT ARE CALLED THE CELL REQUIREMENTS SO IT'S THE DICTATED SORT OF USE OF REVENUES THAT EXCEED A PARTICULAR LIMIT. AND THE GOVERNOR THE TWO LARGEST CATEGORIES IN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL ARE SORT OF- TAX REFUNDS ELEVEN HALF BILLION FOR TAX REFUNDS AND THEN TWENTY TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN. CAPITAL OUTLAY I SHOULD MAYBE JUST BACK UP A NODE IN TERMS OF THE OVERALL ALLOCATION OF THE SURPLUS THE POLICY AREAS THAT I GUESS BENEFIT MOST FROM THE ALLOCATION OF THE SURPLUS- ARE TOO AND IT'S- A NATURAL RESOURCES AND ANSWER TRANSPORTATION OR THE TOO BIG POLICY AREAS. WHICH ARE RECEIVING- FUNDING FROM THE FROM THE SURPLUS. SO WHAT DOES ALL THIS MEAN FOR THE FOR THE BUDGET YEAR AND THE OUT OF THE OUT YEARS AND- A KEY POINT TO MAKE IN A KEY FINDING IS THAT. THERE IS A VERY SIGNIFICANT FISCAL CLIFF THAT THE STATE IS GOING TO HIT IN IN IN TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FOUR SO JUST ONE YEAR OUT FROM FROM THE BUDGET YEAR. AND THAT AND THIS IS SORT OF DUE TO THE OPERATION OF THE STATE APPROPRIATIONS LAMENT AND- IT'S A FISCAL CLIFF THAT. CANNOT BE AVOIDD JUST BY BY REVENUES BEING DIFFERENT THAN WE MIGHT PROJECT BUT THIS IS THIS IS A SORT OF A CERTAINTY. AND THAT. WHAT WHAT ARE OFFICE FOUND IS THAT TEN TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR THERE WILL BE STE WHAT A CULT STYLE REQUIREMENTS SO. SORT OF DICTATED SERVE ADDITIONAL SPENDING THAT MUST BE MADE SORT OF BECAUSE OF REVENUES BEING OVER THE LIMIT. OF ABOUT TWENTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS BUT THE SURPLUS THAT WE PROTECT THE PROJECT FOR. FOR TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR IS ONE POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS SO JUST A MERE PITTANCE OF THE TOTAL SPENDING THAT THE- STATE IS REQUIRED TO MAKE KIND UNDER THE STATE APPROPRIATIONS LIMIT. MANY OF YOU MAY BE ASKING ABOUT HER THE RECESSION AND- OUR OFFICE IS NOT PREDICTING A RECESSION BUT WE DO FIND THAT THERE IS VERY MUCH A HEIGHTENED RISK FOR RECESSION OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS BECAUSE OF A NUMBER OF WARNING INDICATORS THAT ARE TRADITIONALLY USED. TO IN IN THE PER PREDICTING NUMBER OF RECESSIONS AND- THOSE ARE HEIGHTENED THERE'S DEFINITELY A HEIGHTENED RISKS FOR A RECESSION SO. AGAIN NO CERTAINTY IN FORECASTING BUT- DEFINITELY HEIGHTENED RISK. SO WHAT THAT ALL MEANS IN TERMS OF A BOTTOM LINE ALLEY- RECOMMENDATION IS THAT THERE IS VERY MUCH IN NEED IN OUR RECOMMENDATION FROM OUR OFFICE FOR MORE MONIES TO BE PUT INTO RESERVES AND THAT HAS TO BENEFITS AND THAT ONE BENEFIT IS CERTAINLY TO- TO PREVENT AGAINST- SERVER DRESS A BUDGET PROBLEM THAT RESULTS FROM. A RECESSION BUT ALSO TO ADDRESS THESE VERY SIGNIFICANT REQUIREMENTS UNDER THE STATE APPROPRIATION LIMIT THAT ARE GOING TO HIT IN TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR. BUT BEFORE THIS HEARING TRANSITIONS TO DISCUSSING SORT OF INDIVIDUAL PROPOSALS IN THE IN THE HEALTH AREA. I'D LIKE TO NOTE THAT THE LARGEST WE CERTAINLY THE LEGISLATURE WHO HAS INTEREST. IN NET MAKING SIR SPENDING AUGMENTATIONS AND ACROSS VARIOUS POLICY AREAS INCLUDING THE HEALTH AREA. AND DAD SO WHILE THERE IS THIS SORT OF THECELL REQUIREMENTS OF IN THE BACKGROUND WE THINK THAT THE LEGISLATURE OB. IS LIKELY TO IT TO MAKE AUGMENTATIONS AND WHEN IT DOES WE HAVE A JUST A FRAMEWORK TO SUGGEST. TO YOU TO HELP GUIDE YOUR OF YOUR DELIBERATIONS AND WE THINK IT'S A VERY VERY HIGH BAR THAT THAT NEEDS TO BE PASSED. FOR A FOR A SPENDING AUGMENTATION THAT DOESN'T HELP THE STATE MEET THE STATE APPROPRIATIONS LIMIT SO IF IT WERE AN AUGMENTATION FOR INSTANCE FOR CAPITAL OUTLAY OR FOR EMERGENCY SPENDING THAT DOES THAT DOES HELP. BUT SAID MANY POTENTIAL AUGMENTATIONS ARE OUTSIDE THAT TYPE OF TYPE OF SPENDING. SO CLEARLY. WE WOULD. WE WOULD RECOMMEND THAT TO SPENDING AUGMENTATIONS BE ON VERY HIGH PRIORITY LEGISLATIVE OF THE NEEDS. OFFER A NO WIN PROBLEM AND THAT THE SOLUTION SORT OF IS PROVEN TO BE. EFFECTIVE AND IT WOULD WORK TOWARDS THE- TOWARDS THE GOAL. R. AND MAY ALSO BE SOME VERY SOME POTENTIAL FOR FISCAL BENEFITS FROM SPENDING FRIENDS OVER THE LONGER RUN- FOR INSTANCE- SPENDING TODAY THAT THAT TO. GREAT SAVINGS SERVE IN THE IN THE FUTURE OR SPENDING TODAY THAT. ARE DRAWS DOWN FEDERAL FUNDS THAT'S VERY RELEVANT IN THE IN THE IN THE HEALTH AREA- SO JUST TO A FINAL THOUGHT TO AS AS YOU'RE CONSIDERING THE PROPOSALS- ADEN AND WE'RE NOT SAYING THAT'S A NON STARTER TO. IF IT'S A AN AUGMENTATION BUT- BUT A HIGH BAR AND WE'RE VERY HELP. VERY WILLING TO SORT OF HELP BUT YOU IN IN THE EVALUATION OF THE MINISTRATIONS PROPOSALS AND PROPOSALS THAT YOU MAY. YOU MAY SUGGEST YOURSELVES- THE FOR TO WORKING WITH YOU AND A TALKING MORE ABOUT THE END. FOR AND HAPPY ANSWERED ANY QUESTIONS THAT RIGHT NOW THE CHAIR MEMBER THANK YOU MR NOON WE'RE GOING TO HOLD ALL QUESTIONS UNTIL AFTER THE PRESENTATIONS AND- FOR. MEDICAL RESEARCH. NEXTRA COULD WE HAVE THE AGENCY SPEAKERS FOR THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY MAY REVISE PROPOSALS. FOR THESE BEGIN WHEN YOU'RE READY THERE SHOULD BE A LITTLE MIKE BUTTON RIGHT.

FROM MY SOCIAL ISOLATION CAUSED BY THE PANDEMIC. INTENSIFIED AN ALREADY EXISTING MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS AMONG CHILDREN AND YOUTH. THE PARTICULARLY AS THE CHAIR ALSO MENTIONED. FOR YOUTH OF COLOR IN LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES OF YOU WHICH A FEW. AND OTHER GROUPS I'M IN UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. MENTAL HEALTH IS NOW THE LEADING CAUSE OF HOSPITALIZATION FOR CHILDREN UNDER EIGHTEEN IN CALIFORNIA. AND DEEPLY CONCERNING. IS THE INCREASING USE SUICIDE RATES OVER THE LAST DECADE. CDPH DATA TRACKED A 20% INCREASE IN SUICIDE AMONG TEN TO EIGHTEEN YEAR OLDS FROM TWENTY NINETEEN TO TWENTY TWENTY. ROCK YOU FEMALE YOUTH AND HISPANIC YOUTH ALL EXPERIENCED INCREASED RATES OF SUICIDE IN THAT TIME PERIOD. THE SUICIDE RATE FOR BLACK YOUTH IN CALIFORNIA DOUBLED BETWEEN TWENTY FOURTEEN AND TWENTY TWENTY. A RECENT STUDY SHOWS THAT 40% A TRANS GENDER INDIVIDUALS HAVE ATTEMPTED SUICIDE WITH SUICIDE RISK BEING HIGHEST AMONGST TRANSGENDER YOUTH. IN A RECENT SURVEY OF CALIFORNIA STUDENTS FOUND ABOUT ONE THIRD OF SEVENTH AND EIGHTH GRADERS. AND ALMOST HALF OF ELEVENTH GRADERS EXPERIENCED CHRONIC SADNESS. THE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT OF ONE TIME FUNDS THROUGH THE CHILDREN YOUTH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INITIATIVE WILL HAVE A MEANINGFUL IMPACT ON OUTCOMES FOR CHILDREN YOUTH IN THE LONG TERM. HOWEVER AS WE CONTINUE TO WORK HARD TO EFFECTIVELY DEVELOP DESIGN AND IMPLEMENT THE COMPONENTS OF THE CHILDREN YOU THINK EVER HEALTH INITIATIVE. THERE IS AN URGENT AND IMMEDIATE NEED TO CONTINUE TO INVEST IN EFFORTS TO ADDRESS CHILDREN'S BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. WITH A FOCUS ON MORE IMMEDIATE ACTION. UNDER THIS PROPOSAL CALLIE TO ADDRESS WILL INVEST IT INVEST ADDITIONAL RESOURCES IN TARGETED EFFORTS NOW. TO ADDRESS URGENT AND EMERGENT ISSUES IN CHILDREN WITH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH.

A VIDEO SERIES IT REALLY AIMS AT SUPPORTING WELLBEING AND RESILIENCE FOR PARENTS THAT THEY CAN HELP THEIR KIDS COPE AND ADDRESS THEIR MENTAL HEALTH. FUNDING IN THE PROPOSAL WOULD ALSO BE USED TO LEVERAGE EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES TO REALLY FOCUS ON NEXT GENERATION DIGITAL SUPPORT THAT. AT PROMOTE POSITIVE MENTAL HEALTH AND HELP AMELIORATE WHAT WE KNOW CAN SOMETIMES BE OF SOME TECHNOLOGIES A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON CHILDREN AND YOUTH APRIL HELPED. AND LAST WEEK IT WOULD SUPPORT BUILDING THE PIPELINE OF CULTURALLY DIVERSE FUTURE WORK FORCE OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. PARTICULARLY WITH THIS FOCUS ON EMERGING NEXT GENERATION TECHNOLOGIES HOPEFULLY BEING A HOPE TO BRING AND THAT NEXT GENERATION.

THAT CONCLUDES OUR COM. THANK YOU DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ANY COMMENTS. PATTERSON SHEFFIELD BERMAN FINANCE NO COMMENTS. THANK YOU HELLO IN THE COMMENTS L. L. YOU HEAR ME OK. AND WE ARE CONTINUING TO VIEW THE PROPOSALS- BUT A FEW OF THEM WE'VE BROUGHT ONE TO DISCUSS ANY OF THE CAR AFTER I'VE HAD SHE'D AFTER I FINISH MY COMMENTS ON FIRST ON THE RETENTION PAYMENTS TO HEALTH CARE WORKERS- WE ARE WAITING FOR THE DETAILS ON THE STRUCTURE. OF THE PAYMENTS INCLUDE THE SPECIFIC CRITERIA OF WHO WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR THE PAYMENTS- BUTTOCK. AND WE'D ALSO NOTE THAT ON. THE QUESTION OF TO THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE PAYMENTS WOULD ACTUALLY IMPROVE RETENTION WHICH WE UNDERSTAND IS ONE OF THE GOALS OF THE PAYMENTS- WE ALSO ARE LOOKING INTO WHETHER OR THIS WOULD BE A CONSTITUTIONAL USE OF THE FUNDS AND OF THE STATE CONSTITUTION. THAT'S THERE IS A RESTRICTION ON THE USE OF PUBLIC FUNDS WHEN GIVEN TO PRIVATE ENTITIES. IT'S UNCLEAR THAT IS PUTTING ITS APARTMENTS- I WILL NOW TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE CORY ISHIDA. THANK YOU DR AMBULANT AND MEMBERS- KOREAN SHEET WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- WE HAVE SOME INITIAL COMMENTS TO RAISE ON THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISION CARE COURT PROPOSALS- WHICH CUT ACROSS MULTIPLE DEPARTMENTS INCLUDING BCS- WE HAVE NOT. FULLY REVIEWED THE- DIETZ THE S. B. C. P. ATTACHED TO CARE COURT YET BUT WE ANTICIPATE DOING THAT SOON- IN ADDITION TO THE- ROUGHLY FIFTEEN MILLION WITH ONE MILLION ON GOING PROPOSED. FOR DH CS THE GOVERNOR ALSO PROPOSES ROUGHLY FORTY MILLION WITH ABOUT THIRTY EIGHT MILLION ON GOING. TO THE JUDICIAL BRANCH TO FOR COURT PROCEEDINGS ASSOCIATED WITH CARE COURT. AND TEN MILLION DOLLARS TO THE DEPARTMENT OF AGING TO ADMINISTER THE CARE COURT. A SUPPORTER PROGRAM- WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE IMPLEMENTING LANGUAGE FOR CARE COURT IS CURRENTLY AND SENATE BILL THIRTEEN THIRTY EIGHT. OF THIS BILL IS CURRENTLY GOING THROUGH THE POLICY PROCESS AND MAY CONTINUE TO CHANGE AND EVOLVE GOING FORWARD. ACCORDINGLY THIS MEANS THAT THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF FUNDING NEEDED AT THE STATE AND LOCAL LEVEL TO ENSURE CARE COURTS OPERATE AS INTENDED- DEPENDS STRONGLY ON THE SPECIFIC PROCESSES AND REQUIREMENTS INCLUDED IN THE FINAL LEGISLATION. ADDITIONALLY WE WOULD NOTE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT IS STILL WORKING WITH COUNTIES. TO IDENTIFY ASSOCIATED COSTS. WHICH ARE LIKELY SIGNIFICANT- WHEN YOU WHEN THINKING ABOUT CARE COURT- WITHOUT FULLY IDENTIFIED STATE AND LOCAL BECAUSE IT'S DIFFICULT FOR THE TO WEIGH THIS PROPOSAL AGAINST THE OTHER GENERAL FUND PRIORITIES- IN ADDITION THERE ARE A NUMBER OF KEY CONSIDERATIONS. THAT COULD ALSO IMPACT WHAT LEVEL OF FUNDING IS NEEDED TO ADMINISTER THE CARE COURT PROGRAM. THESE INCLUDE FOR EXAMPLE HOW EXISTING PROGRAMS SUCH AS MEDICARE OUR ARE SUPPOSED TO INTERACT WITH CARE COURT- AND WHAT IF ANY ADDITIONAL LOCAL CAPACITY IS NEEDED TO ENSURE THE PROGRAM RUNS WELL- ACCORDINGLY WE THINK THAT IT'S PREMATURE TO CONSIDER THE GOVERNOR'S.

OUR INTERVIEW IS THAT SHIFTING THIS RESPONSIBILITY WHILE THE PANDEMIC REMAINS SERVE ON GOING ON COULD DELAY THE DISSEMINATION OF IMPORTANT INFORMATION ON VACCINES AND OTHER PUBLIC HEALTH LAB RELATED- MEASURES.

IT ALSO REFLECTS AN ADJUSTMENT TO. OR IN A- DUE TO THE INSTRUCTING IN THE CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IN HONG NOTHING FURTHER THAT. HELLO ANY COMMENTS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR NUMBERS CORE ISSUE TO WITH THE L. A- WE'RE STILL REVIEWING THE DEPARTMENT'S PROPOSALS AND WILL FOLLOW UP IF WE IDENTIFY ANY ISSUES THE FLAG. THANK YOU NEXT WE WILL HAVE COMMISSIONS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR DR TOBY EWING. PRESENT ON THE COMMISSION'S PROPOSALS. OR. THANK MEDICARE MEMBERS ARE WE ON GREAT I APPRECIATE THE CHANCE TO JOIN TUESDAY TO BE DOING ON BEHALF MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OVERSIGHT ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION WILL BE VERY BRIEF WE HAVE FIVE PROPOSALS FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION- I. PASSED AS YOU KNOW THE- RECEIVES FUNDING IN THE ANNUAL BUDGET TO SUPPORT COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH THROUGH OUR SPD TO TRIP CRISIS. YEAH IT'S GRANT PROGRAM. THAT PROGRAM REALLY FOCUSES ON CRISIS RESPONSE IT LIMITS OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE GRANTS ONLY TO COUNTY BEHAVIOR HEALTH PARTNERS. AND ONLY FOR PERSONNEL GRANT. THE COMMISSION WOULD LIKE TO TRANSITION THAT FUND PROGRAMS TO PROVIDE MORE UPSTREAM STRATEGIES FOCUSING ON PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION IN ADDITION TO CRISIS RESPONSE. AS SUCH WE HAVE A BROADER ARRAY OF COMMUNITY PARTNERS WHO ARE IN A POSITION TO SUPPORT THOSE PREVENTION KIND AND EARLY INTERVENTION STRATEGIES. WE'RE LOOKING FOR A SERIES OF MODIFICATIONS THAT WOULD ALLOW GREATER FLEXIBILITY NEEDS TO THE FUNDS TO ACTUALLY MARC. TO EXPAND OPPORTUNITIES TO PARTNER WITH PEOPLE INCLUDING THE COUNTY BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE COUNTIES. TO ALLOW THE GRANT FUNDS TO BE USED FOR THINGS OTHER THAN SIMPLY PERSONNEL. TO COME. INTO RIGHT NOW WE CANNOT USE THOSE FUND WE CANNOT REQUIRE MATCHING FUNDS SOME PARTNERS COULD PROVIDE MATCHING FUNDS. AND LASTLY OUR SMALLEST COMMUNITY PARTNERS REALLY STRUGGLE TO PARTICIPATE IN COMPETITIVE GRANT PROGRAMS LIKE A MODIFICATION IN NARROW CIRCUMSTANCES BE ABLE TO RELEASE THOSE FUNDS YOU NON COMPETITIVE GRANTS. THE TICKET WHEN WORKING WITH SMALLER COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS ARE SMALL THE VERY SMALLEST COUNTIES. THE ONE OF OUR PROPOSALS IT'S TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE TO MODIFY THAT. ONLINE I'M GONNA REMOVE THIS BECAUSE IT'S VERY CHALLENGING TO SPEAK AND BREATHE. YEAH THOSE TWO THINGS ARE PROBABLY ESSENTIAL AT THE MOMENT. SECOND WE'RE ASKING FOR AN AUGMENTATION OF FUNDING TO SUPPORT THE ADVOCACY WORK THAT THE COMMISSION AUTHORIZES A WE PROVIDE GRANT FUNDS TO ARRANGE A COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS. BASICALLY TO ELEVATE THE VOICE OF MENTAL HEALTH PEERS FAMILY MEMBERS AND CONSUMERS THE STRENGTH IN THE KINDS OF SERVICES THAT ARE AVAILABLE THROUGH OUR COUNTY AND COMMUNITY PARTNERS. LOOKING FOR TO DOUBLE THE FUNDING THAT IS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE TO SUPPORT THE WORK FOR IMMIGRANTS AND REFUGEES AS YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA IS FACING TREMENDOUS CHALLENGES AS WE TAKEN AND- PEOPLE FROM AROUND THE WORLD AND- BEING TREMENDOUS. WRAP THINGS IT. E. D. S. T. THICKLY FOR. DIVERSE IMMIGRANT REFUGEE POPULATION THEY WERE HOPING TO EXPAND FUNDING FROM SIX HUNDRED SEVENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR TO DOUBLE THAT AN ADDITIONAL. SEVENTY THOUSAND. ADDITIONALLY ALTHOUGH WE DO PROVIDE FUNDING THAT FOCUSES ON THE NEEDS OF TRANSITION AGE YOUTH ADVOCACY GROUP NEED YOUTH AND YOUNG CHILDREN. IT'S BEEN SUCH A TREMENDOUS INVESTMENT IN SCHOOL MENTAL HEALTH THAT WHAT WE'RE HEARING IS HOW IMPORTANT IT IS FOR SCHOOL AGE YOUTH TO BE ENGAGED IN ADVOCACY AROUND THE WORK THAT'S HAPPENING. IN OUR SCHOOLS AND OUR COMMUNITIES TO MEET THEIR NEEDS AND SO THE COMMISSION IS ASKING FOR FUNDING TO SUPPORT. WAYS TO ELEVATE THE VOICE OF SCHOOL AGE YOUTH THAT THOSE INVESTMENTS ARE ACTUALLY DESIGNED TO BE RESPONSIVE TO THE NEEDS OF YOUNG PEOPLE. AT THE SECOND ABOUT. A THIRD PROPOSAL IS- WE RECENTLY LOST A COMMISSIONER SHE SHE PASSED AWAY RECENTLY AND SHE WAS A PEER. AND SHE WAS VERY UNIQUE IN THAT SHE HAD WORKED FOR COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND SHOULD WORK FOR THE STATE GOVERNMENT. AND THAT PERSPECTIVE GAVE HER A TREMENDOUS. LEVEL OF EMPATHY AND UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT HAPPENS IN OUR COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM AND OUR STATEMENTS HEALTH SYSTEM. AND IT REVEALED TO US UNFORTUNATELY IT WAS HER PASSING THAT REVEALED TO US. THAT WHILE THE STATE HAS MADE TREMENDOUS PROGRESS IN EMBRACING THE ROLE OF PEERS. IN COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WE HAVE NOT YET DONE SO IN STATE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. AND SO THE ARGUMENT HERE IS THAT IF WE REALLY WANT TO UNDERSTAND HOW STATE POLICIES AND PROGRAMS. CAN BE ALIGNED TO THE VERY REAL LIVED EXPERIENCE OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE STRUGGLED WITH THEIR MENTAL HEALTH. ADDICTION AND SO FORTH THAT WE SHOULD EMBRACE PEERS NOT JUST IN OUR COMMUNITY BEHAVIOR HEALTH SYSTEM. BUT IN STATE GOVERNMENT AND SO WE'RE ASKING FOR TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE AND FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF CALAIS CHART TO ACTUALLY BRING PEERS. IN THE STATE GOVERNMENT IN LEADERSHIP ROLES TO REALLY SHAPE THE POLICIES AND PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE. IN CALIFORNIA WE THINK THAT WILL BE INSTRUMENTAL IN MAKING SURE THAT THE WORK WE DO IS ACTUALLY ALIGNED WITH THE REAL WORLD. EXPERIENCES THE PEOPLE TRYING TO SERVE. FOR SOME AND THIS IS VERY SIMILAR OUR FOURTH PROPOSAL. IS AS MANY OF YOU KNOW THE COMMISSION REALLY FOCUSES ON DATA WE FOCUS ON OUTCOMES WE FOCUSED ON INCENTIVES. WE FOCUS ON REALLY TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHY THE SYSTEMS THAT WE HAVE TODAY ARE DELIVERING THE KIND OF OUTCOMES THAT WE HAVE. AND HOW DO WE CHANGE THE DESIGN OF PROGRAMS TO BE MORE PERFORMANCE AND OUTCOME ORIENTED. AND SO WERE WERE ASKING FOR FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN ONE TIME FUNDS. THE PARTNER WITH AN ACADEMIC PARTNER TO ACTUALLY LAUNCH A BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PERFORMANCE FELLOWSHIP. AS WE'VE TALKED WITH OUR COMMUNITY PARTNERS PARTICULAR A COUNTIES. MANY OF THEM RECOGNIZE THAT THEIR STAFF THEIR LEADERSHIP THEIR MANAGER'S ACTUALLY COULD BENEFIT FROM. FOCUSED EDUCATION AND TRAINING AROUND HOW WE CAN DO A BETTER JOB DRIVING OUT COMES INTO THE WAY WE DESIGN AND DELIVER SERVICES AND SO WE'RE LOOKING TO BUILD. A FELLOWSHIP THAT WOULD BE THAT WOULD TARGET STATE EMPLOYEES AND COUNTY. LEADERS THE BEHAVIOR HEALTH SPACE TRULY DRIVE PERFORMANCE AND OUTCOMES INTO THAT WORK. ONE TIME FUNDING WITH THE INTENT OF LAUNCHING A PROGRAM THAT WOULD BE FUNDED THROUGH REVENUES. ASSOCIATED WITH PEOPLE SIGNING UP PARTICIPATING IN THE FELLOWSHIP BUT THERE ARE SOME START UP COSTS. AND SO THE FUNDING WOULD BE SPREAD OVER FIVE YEARS WITH AN INTENT. BY THE END OF THE FIVE YEARS IT WOULD BE SELF SUSTAINING. AND LET'S SEE MY FAITH IS. INCREASINGLY THE COMMISSION IS CALLED UPON. TO WORK WITH POLICY MAKERS AND LEGISLATIVE STAFF AND OTHERS AROUND LEGISLATION AND SO. WOULD LIKE TO ADD A POSITION TO THE COMMISSION TO IMPROVE OUR ABILITY TO BE RESPONSIVE TO YOUR NEEDS. WITH ADMINISTRATION AROUND POLICY. AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU SEE A LOT OF ME THESE DAYS AND- YOU MIGHT NOT WANT TO SEE SO MUCH OF MAY AND SO WE'RE HOPING THAT MAYBE SOMEONE ELSE COULD JOIN OUR TEAM WHO COULD HELP US. DELIVER IT OVER TO BE RESPONSIVE TO THE POLICY OPPORTUNITIES AND QUESTIONS THAT WE RECEIVE EVERY DAY. THANKS VERY MUCH OF THAT VERY BRIEF HAVING TO TAKE. THANK YOU DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. MADISON SEVERAL DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. WE JUST WANTED TO NOTE THAT TO THE EXTENT THE LEGISLATURE SEEK TO PRIORITIZE ANY OF THESE PROPOSALS. THAT WE WOULD BE INTERESTED TO UNDERSTAND THE HOW TO LINES THE PROPOSAL ALIGNED WITH. ADMINISTRATION LEGISLATURE PROPOSALS SUCH AS IN THE AREA OF HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE THANK YOU. HELLO THE COMMENTS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN VERSE CHORUS YOU TO WITH THE L. A. WE'RE STILL REVIEWING THE OASES PROPOSALS AND WILL FOLLOW UP IF WE HAVE ANYTHING FLAG. THANK YOU. FINALLY COULD WE HAVE THE COVERED CALIFORNIA AND DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SPEAKERS FOR THE COVERED CALIFORNIA. MAY REVISED PROPOSALS PUT FORWARD. THE SHOPPING ANI WITH THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICE AGENCY TO PREVENT ON THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL. WE ADDRESS THE UNCERTAINTY OF FEDERAL AMERICAN% RESCUE PLAN ACTS ON CONTINUING. TWO THOUSAND TWENTY TWO- THE FEDERAL ACTION IS NOT TAKEN TO EXTEND HARPER PREMIUM SUBSIDIES FOR TWO THOUSAND TWENTY THREE AND BEYOND. THE MAY REVISION INCLUDES THREE HUNDRED AND FOUR MILLION. FROM THE HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY RESERVE FUND FOR BUDGET YEAR AND THREE HUNDRED AND FOUR MILLION GENERAL FUND. IN TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR. AND ANNUALLY THEREAFTER. REINSTATE REINSTITUTE THE CALIFORNIA PREMIUM SUBSIDY PROGRAM. THIS STATE FUNDED PROGRAM INCLUDED PREMIUM SUBSIDIES FOR MIDDLE INCOME CALIFORNIANS WE DID NOT QUALIFY FOR SUBSIDIES. UNDER THE ACA. PRIOR TO THE ENACTMENT OF OUR BUT- THE STATE SUBSIDY PROGRAM DESIGNED FOR CALENDAR TWENTY. CALENDAR YEAR TWENTY TWO THOUSAND TWENTY THREE WOULD BE SIMILAR TO THE TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE PROGRAM DESIGNED. WOULD PROVIDE ADDITIONAL SUBSIDIES TO THE POOR 510026100% FPL GROUP. BRING IN THEIR REQUIRED CONTRIBUTION DOWN FROM EIGHTEEN PERCENT. IN 200021216% IN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY THREE. THIS CONCLUDES MY OVERVIEW AND HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME THANK YOU DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. YES JOSEPH DAWSON FROM THE PARTNER FINANCE NO ADDITIONAL. WITH THE L. A. O. WE WILL CONTINUE O GET THE DETAILS OF THE PROPOSAL I'M NOW WE DO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE IS A STRONG POLICY BASIS FOR DOING- INCREASED. PREMIUM SUBSIDIES IN THE EVENT THAT THE CURRENT ENHANCE FEDERAL PREMIUM SUBSIDIES EXPIRE IN DECEMBER- BOTH IN TERMS OF IMPROVING AFFORDABILITY AS WELL AS PREVENTING PEOPLE FROM- LEAVING COVERAGE DUE TO THE COSTS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU TO ALL OF OUR SPEAKERS AND PANELISTS HERE TODAY- I WILL BEGIN AND SEE IF ANY SUB COMMITTEE MEMBERS HAVE QUESTIONS KEEP IT HERE AT. CHAIR FOR A FEW BEFORE WE GO TO PUBLIC. COMMENT WHICH SHOULD BE THE REMAINDER OF THE HEARING HERE TODAY DO YOU WANT A CHANCE TO ASK BOTH CD PH AND DEPARTMENT OF STATE HOSPITALS A QUESTION AND SO WOULD APPRECIATE IF. YOU COULD MAKE YOUR WAY FORWARD. WE'LL BEGIN WITH CDPH SINCE YOU'RE JOINING US VIRTUALLY IF I CAN- YOU HAD MENTIONED REAPPROPRIATION OF MONEY FOR TGI WELLNESS AS WELL AS ALL CHILDREN THRIVE. AND I ALSO BELIEVE THAT IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE WE HAD S. T. D. FUNDING THAT HASN'T GONE OUT. I'D LIKE TO UNDERSTAND WHY IF I CAN AND- I'M AYE I WILL IF. I MAY BRING UP WHAT PUBLIC WHAT WE HEARD EARLIER THAT ARE TRANS. USE 40% HAVE ATTEMPTED SUICIDE SO I'D LIKE TO UNDERSTAND WHY pTHIS MONEY HAS NOT BEEN. GOING OUT. AS WAS APPROPRIATED LAST YEAR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- RELATED TO YOUR FIRST QUESTION ON THE APPROPRIATION ITEM- THAT TO DIFFERENT AREAS OF COURSE BUT OUR OFFICE OF HEALTH EQUITY- FOLKS ARE ON MINE- JASON TESTER OR WROTE ON REDDIT CHRISTIAN I THINK CAN PROVIDE A LITTLE MORE DETAIL ABOUT- THAT REQUESTS- CHASE IN A ROW ON. GO AHEAD JASON. THANK YOU VERY MUCH HIGHER- AND- I APPRECIATE THE QUESTION- CDPH RECOGNIZES WITHIN THE STORK OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS LONGSTANDING AND ENTRENCHED HEALTH INEQUITIES EXPERIENCED BY SOME OF THE MOST MARGINALIZED CALIFORNIANS- HOWEVER THE COMPLEXITY OF THIS GRANT PROGRAM COUPLED WITH THE PREVIOUSLY VERY LIMITED EXPENDITURE AUTHORITY WINDOW OF NINE MONTHS. MADE STAFFING DESIGN AND PROGRAM EVALUATION EFFORTS- JUST REALLY IMPOSSIBLE OVER THAT SHORT PERIOD OF TIME WE ARE- YOU KNOW. THAT SAID THAT WE ARE- ENGAGED- WE HAVE BEEN DISCUSSING- OPTIONS WITH COMMUNITIES AND- WE HAVE TO HELP COVER MEETINGS STAKEHOLDERS CONDUCTED AN INFORMAL NEEDS ASSESSMENT. OF TGI SERVING ORGANIZATIONS AND THEIR ORGANIZATIONAL CAPACITY AND- AND WE REALLY WANT TO DO THIS RIGHT- WE ARE LOOKING TO OUR THE CALIFORNIA- REDUCING DISPARITIES PROJECT AS A MODEL FOR NOT ONLY ENGAGEMENT BUT ALSO IN. THE WAY IN WHICH WE CAN ENGAGE IS SMALL AND MICRO. ORGANIZATIONS SURE THAT THEY HAVE EQUAL ACCESS TO THE FUNDING AND THAT IS THAT IS REALLY OUR OUR FOCUS THEY'RE DOING THIS RIGHT BECAUSE WE UNDERSTAND THE URGENT NATURE OF- OF THIS. I HEAR THAT RESPONSE AND I APPRECIATE WANTING TO DO IT RIGHT I THINK FOR MANY OF US IF THE DOLLARS ARE NOT BEING. UTILIZED WHAT WE AREN'T DOING IT RIGHT AND UNFORTUNATELY WE HAVE TOO MANY. GIRLS WHO ARE EXPERIENCING CRISIS TODAY. SO WOULD AGAIN JUST REALLY URGED MINISTRATION TO WORKS TO. EXPAND RESOURCES THAT WE HAD APPROPRIATE. WITH THAT I WILL. FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE HOSPITALS IF I CAN I'M A DIRECTOR CLINTON AND WANTED TO GET A SENSE FROM YOU ON THE I. S. T. WAITING LIST OR ARE WE GETTING CLOSER TO GETTING THIS UNDER CONTROL I HEAR A LOT LOT ABOUT WHAT THE WORK GROUP DID AND OUR PLANS. BUT I'M- CAN YOU GIVE US SOME ASSURANCES ON THAT AND SECOND IF I CAN WE HEARD EARLIER ABOUT- HOW. THERE ARE RETENTION BONUSES FOR HOSPITAL EMPLOYEES AND- OUR PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITALS AND YET FOR MANY OF OUR STATE HOSPITAL EMPLOYEES. WILL NOT BE GETTING THIS RETENTION BONUS I'M WANTED TO HEAR FROM YOU WHEN WE HAVE SUCH VACANCIES WHY WE WOULDN'T CONSIDER. THIS FOR SAN. OTHER OPPORTUNE FOR US TO REALLY BUILD AND RETAIN. YEAH I DO WITH RESPECT TO THE I. S. T. SOLUTIONS- AND I S. T. WEIGHTLESS AND KIND OF WORKED IS TODAY AND AS YOU NOTED WE DID CONVENE THE I. S. T. SOLUTIONS WORK GROUP LAST YEAR I REALLY LARGELY TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH ALL OF OUR STAKEHOLDERS ABOUT WHAT MORE CAN BE DONE TO REALLY ADDRESS THAT. INCREASING NUMBER OF REFERRALS TO INCREASE CAPACITY AND REALLY TO CHANGE THE ARC OF THE LIVES OF THOSE THAT WE- AND THEM. AS WELL. HIS LARGE THESE INDIVIDUAL ARE INDIVIDUALS WITH SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS WERE JUST CYCLING AND- IN AND OUT OF THE JUSTICE SYSTEM SO WE REALLY DON'T WANT TO JUST TREAT THEM AS AN I. S. T. AND SEND THEM BACK TO PAY SURCHARGES WE WANT TO DO SOMETHING THAT'S MEANINGFUL AND DIFFERENT. AND SO THAT'S REALLY WHAT THE I. S. T. SOLUTIONS PROPOSAL IS DOING IS DOING ITS REALLY PROPOSING TO ADDRESS THIS TIME QALINGE OFTEN TO BECAUSE ONE IS TO TRY TO REALLY ADDRESS THE I. S. T. WAITING TIMES AND TO- AND TO REDUCE THE WEIGHTLESS WHILE ALSO PROVIDING. BETTER ACCESS TO ME BAYSTREET AND DIVERSION IN THE AND ABOUT SO THAT. WE CAN PROVIDE THAT MOVE. IN AND OUT OF THEIR JUSTICE. I WITH RESPECT TO KIND OF WHERE WE ARE TODAY WE ARE- WE DO CURRENTLY HAVE A WAIT LIST OF EIGHTEEN HUNDRED NINETY TWO INDIVIDUAL SO IT STILL IS VERY HIGH. IT'S BEEN SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED BY COVERT- L. R. AND B. AS THE WE AS THE COMMUNITY EXPERIENCES SURGES SO DO WE WITHIN OUR HOSPITALS. AND THAT RELATE TO IN ORDER TO PREVENT THE TRANSMISSION. FROM THE- TO PREVENT THE TRANSMISSION BETWEEN US AND THE JAILS WE'D HAVE HAD TO FREEZE ADMISSIONS. AND I DOES BECAUSE- A BACKUP WE DO THAT FOR A VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME AS YOU KNOW ONLY WHEN IT'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. BUT IT HAS. FURTHER IN DINNER ABILITY. AS WELL AS WE ARE MUCH SLOWER IN GETTING INDIVIDUALS INTO THE HOSPITAL. AS OF THE NATURE OF OUR- ENVIRONMENT WE HAVE TO BRING INDIVIDUALS AND FOR NOW WHAT'S CALLED THE MISSION OBSERVATION UNITS TO BE ABLE TO QUARANTINE THEM. AND TO OBSERVE THEM AND TEST THEM AND SURE THAT THEY DON'T HAVE PROBABLY BEFORE WE MOVE OUT TO OUR VERY LARGE CONGREGATE ENVIRONMENT SO. IT'S REALLY BEEN A BIG CHALLENGE WITH OVER THAT'S REALLY- IMPACTED OUR ABILITY TO REALLY TACKLE THE WAIT LIST. BUT THEN THE OTHER FACTORS THAT THE ICE TO REFERRALS CONTINUE. TO GROW. HE'S A BEING REFERRED TO US AND SO THE IS ALSO AND MAY IT HAPPEN FOR US TO REALLY. BUILD OUR WAY OUT OF IT IS THAT THE NUMBERS CONTINUE TO GROW SO. REALLY THIS- I. S. T. SOLUTIONS PROPOSAL PROVIDES US YOU KNOW. THE SUBSTANTIAL- MOUNTBATTEN'S TO REALLY PROVIDE THAT COMMUNITY BASED TREATMENT FOR INDIVIDUALS. WHILE ALSO PROVIDING THE ABILITY TO DELIVER EARLY ACCESS TO SERVICES SO PEOPLE ARE GETTING TREATMENT WHILE THEY'RE WAITING FOR THAT. I WAS HOPING YOU COULD ADDRESS THE SECOND PART OF THE QUESTION REALLY FOCUSED ON. THE EMPLOYEES WHICH WERE SELECTED TO RECEIVE THE RETENTION BONUS AND- ARE RIGHT NOW FOR NOT INCLUDING ARE YOU ASKING ABOUT THE- WORKER BONUSES THAT'S BEING PROVIDED FOR HEALTH HEALTH CARE HOSPITAL IN SKILLED NURSING THAT'S CORRECT. SO AS WE UNDERSTAND THAT IT DOES INCLUDE OUR HOSPITALS- BUT IT IS GETTING SOMETHING THAT WILL NEED TO GO THROUGH THE BARGAINING PROCESS AND SO COUNTY CHARGES IS I WILL BE WORKING WITH OUR LABOR PARTNERS. WONDERFUL FINAL QUESTION IF I CAN YOU SPOKE EARLIER ABOUT I S. T. DISCHARGE PLANNING AND COORDINATION. AND WAS HOPING TO UNDERSTAND A LITTLE MORE AS WE ARE WORKING ON THOSE TRANSITIONS. ARE ARE WE COORDINATING CURRENTLY WITH C. B. H. HIER ARE WE PLANNING WITH THEM SO THAT THOSE WHO ARE BEING RELEASED ARE. ROLLED ENGAGED IN FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIPS HOW DO WE HAVE THOSE WARM HANDOFFS AND UNSURE WERE- CREATING THE BEST OPPORTUNITY FIRST. YEAH WITH RESPECT TO THE I. S. T. TRANSITIONS IT REALLY IS SOMETHING THAT IS AN AREA OF OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY IMPROVE AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'VE CERTAINLY. IT WAS JUST GOT QUITE A BIT AND R. I. S. T. SOLUTIONS WORK GROUP AS WELL- THE WAY THAT SO AS AN INDIVIDUAL COMES IN AS INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL OUR ENGAGEMENT HAS PRIMARILY BEEN WITH THE JAILS BECAUSE THEY COME TO US FROM THE JAILS AND WE RETURN THEM TO THE DOUBTS ALL OF OUR DISCHARGE PLANNING HAS BEEN WITH THEM. AND IN IN THOSE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE V. EIGHT VA AS WELL AS THE I. STEEPLY SINCE REALLY THINKING ABOUT THAT AND ABOUT LONGER TERM RUN WHAT HAPPENS TO THEM AFTER THEY RETURNED TO JAIL. AND THEN PROVIDING THAT INFORMATION TO THE COUNTIES. I'M NOT ONLY TO THE DEALS BUT TO OUR COUNTY PARTNERS AS WELL SO THAT THEY CAN START TO PREPARE AND FOR THAT TRANSITION. BECAUSE A LOT OF TIMES WHEN AN INDIVIDUAL GOES BACK TO THE IT- THEY COUNTY JAIL THEY CAN EITHER HAVE THEIR CHARGES DROPPED THEY CAN GET TIME SERVED THING HAPPENED. QUICKLY WE RETURNED THEM AND- THIS WILL BEST THE COUNTY TO BE ABLE TO PREPARE FOR THAT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ALL OF OUR SPEAKER SPEAKERS IF THERE ARE NO ADDITIONAL MEMBER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS WE WILL NOW BEGIN PUBLIC. WE DO HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO WOULD LIKE TO PROVIDE PUBLIC COMMENT THEREFORE I WANT TO URGE YOU TO KEEP YOUR COMMENTS BRIEF SO THAT WE CAN HEAR FROM EVERYONE. WE WILL START WITH IN PERSON COMMENT IN THE HEARING ROOM PLEASE COME FORWARD TO THE MICROPHONE IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A CALL. HI GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR- COMMITTEE MEMBERS- DOUG CHIPATA I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE UNION OF AMERICAN PHYSICIANS DENTISTS WOULD ACTUALLY. I'M ALSO THE CHAIR OF THE EXECUTIVE BOARD FOR A CALIFORNIA ASKS ME. I WANT TO SPEAK SPECIFICALLY TO MAY REVISE AND SPECIFICALLY TO DEPARTMENTS AT HOSPITALS- YOU ALLUDED TO IT IN YOUR IN YOUR QUESTIONS OF THE DIRECTOR. NINE HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS IS PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNOR'S MAY MAY REVISE. FOR HOSPITAL RETENTION AND THEY THEY CITED THAT'S GOING TO BE NEGOTIATED THROUGH COLLECTIVE BARGAINING. MISTER CHAIR A SOMEONE WHO CHAIRED LAST TWO SESSIONS WITH THE ADMINISTRATION A KELLY CHAR VACANCY PROBLEM ARE PSYCHIATRISTS AND WE ESSENTIALLY GOT NOWHERE WE'RE NOW TALKING ABOUT ESSENTIAL WORK FORCE WITH THEM WE HAVE TO GO WE HAVE TO TRY AND MAKE A VERY COMPELLING ARGUMENT THAT RE EVEN ESSENTIAL WORKERS. SO IT'S DISAPPOINTING THAT WE HAVE TO GO THAT VENUE. WE WOULD LIKE TO PROPOSE AN ALTERNATIVE ROUTE. WE HAVE CORRESPONDENTS GOING ON ON THE SENATE SIDE SO HERTZBERG IS TAKING THE LEAD SENATOR DODD MANY OF THESE JUST SENATOR LAYERED- SO. VISIT STATE HOUSE WAS A MESS A STAND WITH THE PSYCHIATRIST HERE TODAY. SO I WILL JUST TO TURN IT OVER TO THEM AND HAVE THEM BRIEFLY. TELL YOU WHAT'S GOING ON WITH RESPECT TO VACANCIES AT STATE HOSPITALS WHICH EXCEED 50% MISTER CHAIR. WE HAVE DOCTOR BUSTER BOARD PRESIDENT WHO CAN INTRODUCE OUR DOCTORS THANK YOU SIR. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN ARAMBULA AND I WANT TO JUST SPEAK FIRST TO THE- THOU REQUIREMENTS I HEARD EARLIER WHICH REALLY DOVETAIL VERY NICELY WITH. WITH WHAT- THANK YOU PETA JUST SAID. THAT YOU NEED A HIGH BAR AND EMERGENCY. KNOWN PROBLEM. IT'S KNOWN AS STATISTICALLY PROVABLE YOUR 53% THE SOLUTIONS TO FIX OUR GOAL. ARE HAVE BEEN ESPOUSED BY JUDGE MILLER. IN LETTERS AND- PRIOR TO A EIGHT PAGE REPORT THAT WE DID WITH CALLIE CHAR OVER EIGHT MONTHS WHICH WAS IGNORED ESSENTIALLY. SO THAT GOAL IS OBVIOUSLY AS PER JUDGE MILLER AND OR JOINT PAPER TO INCREASE THE SALARY OF THE PEOPLE SO THEY CAN BE COMPETITIVE. AND COME FOR STATE SERVICE AND WE DON'T HAVE TO HIRE THE FIT IN THE FISCAL BENEFITS AS WAS MENTIONED IN THE CELL CRITERIA ARE OBVIOUS. BETWEEN CDC IDEA SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OF ANNUAL WASTE. SO WITH THAT BEING SAID THE SOLUTIONS ARE OBVIOUS YOU. BUT WE NEED WE NEED A HIGHER SALARIES AND SPECIALLY IN LIEU OF PEPPER AND THE OTHER IMPEDIMENTS TO RECRUITMENT WE HAVE RIGHT HERE SEVERAL DOCTORS FROM THE GESTATION CDCR. I LIKE INTRODUCED INTO YOUR DOCTOR KHANNA FROM NAP. THE STATE HAS DOT ABBAS. FROM A PATENT DAY HOSPITAL. AND THAT'S IT THEY'RE GOING TO SPEAK TO THIS. THANK YOU DR BUZZING. I DR MILA I'M I JUST LIKE TO SAY I AM A REGULATORS- STAFF PSYCHIATRIST ON T. ON IN NAPA STATE HOSPITAL MY NAME IS NEIL KHANNA. I'M AND OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF MINDS WE HAD A CONTRACTOR ON THE UNIT ABOVE MINE THAT LEFT AND THEY HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO REPLACE HIM. I SAW ALL THE ALL THE PATIENTS WERE BEING COVERED BY ONE ONE PSYCHIATRIST ON THAT UNIT NORMALLY WE HAVE TWO PSYCHIATRISTS ON EACH UNIT- SO WE'VE- NUMBER OF US HAVE TO. PICK UP THE EXTRA LOAD. I'M. THIS IS KIND OF BECOMING THE NORM I'M- FRANKLY I'M WE ARE STILL WAITING ARM FOR SOME SORT OF- RELIEF AND WE HAVE NOT HAD ANY ARM THERE IS NO- RETENTION SORT OF. BENEFIT RIGHT NOW FRANKLY I'M LOOKING TO SEE WHETHER IT'S WORTH FOR ME TO STICK AROUND- THIS IS- THE CENTURY THE WORKLOAD IS GOING UP. THERE IS NO ACCESS CAPACITY- YOU I NOTICE AND I JUST YOUR MISSION ABOUT I. S. TEASE HER EARLIER. I THERE IS NO CAPACITY BECAUSE OTHER PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO COME AND WORK AT THE STATE HOSPITAL BECAUSE CURRENTLY. THE AMOUNT OF MONEY AND FRANKLY THE RETIREMENT THAT'S BEEN COMPLETELY GUIDED OUR- MAJOR MAJOR IMPEDIMENTS I THE SOLUTION IS RELATIVELY SIMPLE- THE PSYCHIATRIST ESSENTIALLY ARM WANT TO HAVE A FAIR THEIR PAY AND BETTER. AT RETIREMENT BENEFITS AND RIGHT NOW THOSE THINGS ARE HAPPENING AND IT'S HARDER TO GET PEOPLE BECAUSE OF THAT AND SO AS A BANDAID I THINK WITH THE STATE HOSPITAL SYSTEM IS DONE IS HIRE CONTRACTORS WHO ARE PAID ABOUT TWICE AS MUCH BY THE WAY- AND SO THAT'S BECOMING ANOTHER ISSUE BECAUSE NOW PEOPLE ARE SAYING YOU KNOW WHAT. WHY AM I YOU EVEN EMPLOYEE. I JUST MOVE ON AND BECOME A CONTRACTOR MYSELF WHICH SOME PEOPLE HAVE DONE- SO THESE ARE THE BIG BIG ISSUES AND I THINK THE SOLUTIONS ARE RELATIVELY STRAIGHTFORWARD- I JUST HOPE THAT- THE STATE HOSPITAL SYSTEM- BARGAINS WITH THEIR UNION IN GOOD FAITH. AND ACTUALLY. GET SOME OF THE STUFF DONE THANK YOU. HI GOOD AFTERNOON DR ARAMBULA JEREMIAH MILLER AND- I AM DR CHUNG FROM PATTON STATE HOSPITAL AND THE PENN STATE HOSPITAL IS THE LARGEST FORENSIC HOSPITAL IN THE COUNTRY WE HAVE APPROXIMATELY FIFTEEN HUNDRED BEDS- WHEN I STARTED ALMOST FOURTEEN OVER FOURTEEN YEARS AGO. WE WERE FULL LARGELY PART OF THE COLEMAN ORDERED WE WERE THE STATE RAISE THE SALARY OF A PSYCHIATRIST TO A LEVEL WHICH IN WHICH WAS COMPETITIVE SO A LOT OF- YOUNG PSYCHIATRIST LIKE ME AT THE TIME UGH YOU KNOW YOUNG CAREER PSYCHIATRISTS WERE. BEING DRAWN FROM KAISER AND OUTSIDE COMPETITORS TO COME TO THE STATE THAT WAS THE JOB BECAUSE IT PAID US WELL FOR WORK AND SO THE STATE DIDN'T. BACK AND- THERE WAS AT ONE POINT WHERE WE WERE ALMOST ONE HUNDRED PSYCHIATRISTS FULL AND NOW WE'RE DOWN TO TWENTY NINE. TWENTY NINE WE THE STATE PSYCHIATRISTS ARE THE LARGEST JOB VACANCY OF ALL STATE JOB POSITIONS WE ARE THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM. AND SIMILAR TO WHAT DOG AND DOG AND DOCTOR BUT HE SAID YOU KNOW EVEN THOUGH IT WAS. IN THE WHITE PAPER CO AUTHORED BY K. WAS OUR UNION EVEN. COMMENDED THE OFFICE OF THE SPECIAL MASTER TO INCREASE SALARIES TO MAKE US COMPETITIVE- THAT WAS NOT DONE. IN PRISON OFFICIALS SAID YOU KNOW THAT'S GOING TO BE TAKEN CARE OF IN BARGAINING AND YET IN BARGAINING THAT WAS COMPLETELY NON NEGOTIABLE PSYCHIATRIST SALARIES THAT WAS OFF THE TABLE WE COULD EVEN TALK ABOUT THAT. SO HERE WE ARE AND WHY DO VACANCIES MATTER IT'S BECAUSE IMAGINE IF YOU WERE IN THE HOSPITAL. YOU WOULD NOT WANT YOUR UNIT YOUR ICU TO BE 45% STAFFED NOT BECAUSE YOUR DOCTORS INCOMPETENT BUT BECAUSE THEY SIMPLY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH TIME. TO TAKE CARE OF ALL THE CRITICALLY ILL PATIENTS AND THAT'S WHO WE TAKE CARE OF WE HAVE THE MOST SEVERELY CRITICALLY ILL PATIENTS IN THE STATE MEAN THE STATE IS THE LARGEST WE HAVE THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND. RIDLEY MENTALLY ILL PATIENTS GOING UP YOU KNOW SUICIDE RATES ARE GOING UP DRUG OVERDOSES ARE AT ALL TIME HIGH BY THE CDC OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND OVERDOSES ALL OF THESE. THINGS IMPACT OUR PATIENT POPULATION THEY ARE SO SICK SO WHILE THE NUMBERS GO UP THE NUMBER OF PSYCHIATISTS ARE DROPPING. AND THAT'S NOT BEING ADDRESSED AND SO I IMPLORE YOU TO PLEASE ACT AND- AND HELP US GET. TO A LEVEL THAT WE CAN COMPETE IS BECAUSE THE REASON I WERE VACANT IS OBVIOUS ON BECAUSE OF OUR SALARIES ARE NOT COMPETITIVE. IT WOULD ANYONE WHO'S IN COMING OUT OF RESIDENCY OR EVEN LOOKING FOR A JOB CHOOSE WERE MY PATIENTS WHO ARE THERE FOR MURDER AND RAPE ARE THIS CLOSE TO ME WE DON'T HAVE ANY SECURITY ON THE UNITS WE HAVE A WHISTLE AND AN ALARM SYSTEM THAT WE HOPE WILL WORK THERE'S NO HOSPITAL. ON THE UNIT. THE SEALS WERE OUTSIDE OF THE FENCE I HAVE SO MANY COLLEAGUES WHO HAVE BEEN ASSAULTED. PERMANENTLY MAIMED. ALL OF THAT IT'S A DANGEROUS JOB AND NOW WE'RE EXPOSED TO COVE IT SO FOR ALL OF THESE REASONS THE- THE MONEY AND THEN ALSO. NOT TO FORGET THE FACT THAT. THERE IS. NO WELL THEIR OWN THEY'RE GETTING PAID WHAT THEY'RE WORTH WE ARE NOT. THERE AND WHAT THESE CONTRACT POSITION THAT ARE PAID MORE THAN TWICE AS MUCH SO FOR EACH IN THE REPORT THAT. YOU SHOULD HAVE THAT WAS WRITTEN BY CALIFORNIA PD. FOR EACH CONTRACTOR. THEY'RE MAKING THEY'RE COSTING THE STATE ONE HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS MORE PER YEAR PER CONTRACTOR. I MEAN I WANT TO KNOW IS IT. WHY ARE. SO MUCH MONEY. IN A WE CAN TAKE IF. OF WHAT WE'RE TAKING. TO THE CALL. AND GET AS A SALARY THAT BRINGS US UP TO. THE LEVEL OF COMPETITION AND THAT'S WHY IT MATTERS IS BECAUSE WE ARE TAKING CARE OF SERIOUSLY MENTALLY ILL PATIENTS WHO ARE SUFFERING BECAUSE OF OUR VACANCY RATES. THANK YOU. THANK YOU DOCTOR.

AND THEY CAN JUST TO KEEP THE PATIENTS NEAR REPORT OF A MINIMUM JUST KEEPING THEM STABLE NOT REALLY TREATING THEM AND GET OUT AND TRANSITIONAL. COMMUNITY THINK OF ALL THIS YOU KNOW AND IS UNFAIR SYSTEM. AT OUR INVERTER COMPENSATE TO GETTING OUR SALARIES ARE NOT COMPETITIVE WITH THE COMMUNITY. OTHER THE LAW COME TO THE COMMUNITY.
