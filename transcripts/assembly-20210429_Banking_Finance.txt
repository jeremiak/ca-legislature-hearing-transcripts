TO DATE THE FUND HAS RECEIVED NO CLAIMS YET MANY. LOW AND MODERATE INCOME HOMEOWNERS WITH PACE ASSESSMENTS ARE STRUGGLING TO PAY THEIR INCREASED ESCROWED PROPERTY TAX PAYMENTS ADDITIONALLY BECAUSE ONLY FIRST MORTGAGE LENDERS ARE ALLOWED TO FILE COMPENSATION CLAIMS FOR LOSSES INCURRED AFTER FORECLOSURE THE FUND IS NOT CURRENTLY BEING USED TO RESENT AVOIDABLE. FORECLOSURES THE FUND IS ALSO CURRENTLY NOT PREVENTING FORECLOSURES OR ALLEVIATING THE CONCERNS OF FEDERAL AGENCIES REGARDING PACE LIENS JUMPING AHEAD OF EXISTING MORTGAGES CONSEQUENCE SLEEP CONSEQUENCE LATELY THESE AGENCIES ARE YET TO APPROVE FINANCING ON PROPERTIES WITH PACE ASSESSMENTS AND NEITHER THE HOMEOWNERS IN OUR LENDERS CAN BENEFIT FROM THE CURRENT SYSTEM.

WHEN YOU BEGIN TO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT DOLLAR AND IF THERE'S OVERDRAFT FEES THERE'S FEES THERE'S CHARGES A MINIMUM BALANCES THAT FIFTEEN DOLLARS AN HOUR. CONTINUES TO SHRINK AND WHAT WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO DO HERE IS TO HELP- THOSE ON THE LOWEST ECONOMIC SCALES WHO ARE EITHER UNDERBANKED OR UNBANKED TO HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD UP THAT CREDIT TO BE ABLE TO. PURCHASE A CAR TO BE ABLE TO BE- HOMEOWNERS TO BE ABLE TO MOVE ON THAT NEXT AVAILABLE STAFF AND YOU KNOW TELL YOU FROM THE EXPERIENCE THAT I HAD ONE WHEN I WAS A CHILD. YOU OFTENTIMES WHEN IMMIGRANT COMMITTEES COME TO THE UNITED STATES OF FINANCIAL SITUATIONS ARE ARE THOSE- I DON'T THINK THERE FOR AND IT IS TRUE WHEN I WAS GROWING UP THAT OUR PARENTS WOULD. GO TO THE GO TO THE LOCAL LIQUOR STORE CASH A CHECK AND YOU KEEP THE MONEY HOME THIS IS EXACTLY WE'RE TRYING TO AVOID WORK TRYING TO GET PEOPLE IN THE SYSTEM TO GET BANKED SO THAT WE HAVE THAT. OPPORTUNITY TOWARDS THE AMERICAN DREAM IN ELEVEN SEVENTY SEVEN THE PUBLIC BANKING OPTION GIVES US THAT OPPORTUNITY AND NOW IT PRESENTS I WILL HEAD OVER TO A MISTER TO. WHO'S BEEN A- JOINT AUTHORS BILL FOR. THANK YOU MR SANTIAGO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR LET ME JUST FIRST START BY THANKING- ARE CHAIR THINKING MANY OF THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE I KNOW FOR.

JUST A BUILT ON- OUR OUR OUR LEAD AUTHOR AND I WANT TO SAY I'M ONE OF I THINK CLOSE TO TWENTY. CO AUTHORS OF THIS BILL. WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO ADDRESS ARE THE INCREDIBLE CHALLENGES FACING MANY OF OUR LOW INCOME COMMUNITY MEMBERS. WHO HAVE TO PAY MORE TO ACCESS THEIR MONEY- THEN FOLKS ARE NOT IN THEIR FINANCIAL STATUS- T. PAIN UP TO TEN PERCENT. OF THEIR TAKE HOME PAY IN FEES AND INTEREST. FROM HIGH COST FINANCIAL SERVICES AND PART OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO. WITH THIS BILL IS REALLY. ALLOW FOR THE PROVISION OF BASIC FINANCIAL SERVICES TO HELP LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD. ELIMINATE THE NEED FOR HIGH COST ALTERNATIVES. AND ALLOW OUR COMMUNITIES TO BUILD WEALTH AND BUILD BACK BETTER. FROM THIS PANDEMIC AS- OUR LEAD AUTHOR HAS STATED ONE IN FOUR. ONE IN FOUR OF OUR CONSTITUENTS. EITHER DON'T HAVE A BANK ACCOUNT FOR UC'S COSTLY FINANCIAL SERVICES. LIKE PAYDAY LENDERS AND CHECK CATCHERS. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO BUILD ON AS HE- REITERATED. WE ARE NOT CREATING A PUBLIC BANK- WE'RE TRYING TO CREATE. AN ORGANIZATION THAT COULD PARTNER WITH EXISTING FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO PROVIDE FREE DEBIT CARD ACCOUNTS- THIS BILLS ARE WORK FROM TWO YEARS AGO THAT ALLOW OUR CITIES. TO PILOT ALTERNATIVES TO TRADITIONAL BANKING IN EIGHTY EIGHT FIFTY SEVEN. AND AGAIN WANT TO THANK OUR COALITION THAT'S BEEN WORKING ON THIS. ON THIS- ONE OF THE KEY REQUIREMENTS THAT SHOULD BE HIGHLIGHTED IS THAT THIS PROGRAM. WOULD REQUIRE THE MARKET ANALYSIS- TO ENSURE THAT A PROGRAM IS FINACIALLY VIABLE BEFORE STATE DOLLARS ARE USED. TO ROLL OUT THE PROGRAM- AND WITH THAT. RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU FOR WE WILL NOW MOVE ON TO WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. A REMINDER WITNESSES THAT YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES EACH.

SO WHILE AMERICANS SUFFERED THROUGH OUR WORST PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS IN A HUNDRED YARDS WITH UNEMPLOYMENT SKY HIGH AND INTERMITTENTLY LAPSED FEDERAL BENEFITS. THE COUNTRY'S BIGGEST BANKS ARE DOUBTING THE POOREST AMERICANS FOR BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN PUNITIVE SHE- CURRENTLY BANKS HAVE NO INCENTIVE TO BEHAVE DIFFERENTLY. ON THE FUNDS FROM THE POLICIES AND PRACTICES OF BANKS GO BACK MANY DECADES CAUSING DEEP MISTRUST IN COMMUNITIES OF COLOR IN PARTICULAR. LAST YEAR WE PUBLISHED A REPORT REGARDING ACCESS TO FINANCIAL SERVICES WITH THE OFFICE OF WITH SAN FRANCISCO'S OFFICE OF FINANCIAL EMPOWERMENT. THE REPORT FOUND THAT WELL OVER 40% OF BLACK AND NOT NEXT HOUSEHOLDS ARE UNBANKED AND UNDERBANKED. NO SURPRISE RIGHT. FOR THEIR EXACT ISSUE THIS GAP INC FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AS MATT BY HIGH COST FINANCIAL SERVICES LIKE CHECK CASHIERS. AND PAYDAY LENDERS WHO ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY CONCENTRATED IN COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. HISPANIC CONTRIBUTES TO THE EVER WIDENING RACIAL WEALTH GAP. AB ELEVEN SEVENTY SEVEN GIVE ALL CALIFORNIANS AN OPTION OTHERS NO FEE NO PENALTY ACCOUNT WITHOUT OVERDRAFT CHARGES. THE RESULTING STATING THAT HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO SAVE HARD WORKING FAMILIES FROM COOL THAT TRAPS OF SMALL DOLLAR LOANS. IN ADDITION TO THE ABILITY TO PAY BILLS- THE OTHER SERVICE IT WILL HELP PARTICIPANTS BUILD THEIR CREDIT. SUCH THAT THEY CAN PARTICIPATE IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS AND FINALLY BE ON THE PATH. TO UPWARD MOBILITY AND WEALTH GENERATION THEY CAN NOW QUALIFY FOR A CREDIT CARD OR A SMALL BUSINESS LOAN THAT IS OUT OF REACH RIGHT NOW.

I WILL REPEAT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN SAID ABOUT THIS POINT OUT THAT SOME OF THE PREVIOUS AMENDMENTS UNABLE TO TWENTY FIRST ADDRESS SOME OF THE INITIAL CONCERNS WE HEARD THAT THE PROGRAM COULD REQUIRE A LONG TERM SUBSIDY FROM THE STATE OR THAT THE STATE COULD INCUR LIABILITIES FROM THE PROGRAM WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT WAS TAKEN CARE OF- I WOULD SAY THE SEIU CALIFORNIA POLICE. AB ELEVEN SEVENTY SEVEN IT'S INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT THAT'LL HELP THE UNBANKED AND UNDERBANKED TO PROP ARE PRIMARILY BLACK AND LATINO- THEY COMMITTEE ANNOUNCES NOTES THAT FIFTY PERCENT. OF BLACK HOUSEHOLDS DON'T HAVE A BANK ACCOUNT 40% OF LATINO WE COMPARED WITH THE TWO POINT 4% WHITE I THINK ABOUT SOME OF AN ASTONISHING NUMBER- I WOULD ALSO POINT OUT THAT THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS NOTE THAT THE PRIMARY REASON PEOPLE ARE UNBANKED OR- ONE MINIMUM BALANCE REQUIREMENTS CHU HI FI. AND THREE A GENERAL DISTRUST OF BANKS WE BELIEVE AB ELEVEN SEVENTY SEVEN LAVA DRESS THE FIRST TWO CONCERNS BY CREATING THE SNOW PEAS BANKING ACCOUNT. WE ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT A BILL ALONE CANNOT CURE PERSONS DISTRUSTED BANKS HOWEVER WE BELIEVE THE INCREDIBLY LONG LIST OF SUPPORTERS INCLUDING UNIONS LIKE SEIU AT ALL COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS WILL- BE ABLE TO HELP BRIDGE THE GAP- I'M HERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE MAY HAVE AGAIN WE THANK YOU FOR WORKING WITH US ON THIS.

LET ME START BY SAYING CREDIT YOU'D BE GREETED WITH THE STATED INTENT OF THE BILL FROM THE BELIEVE IT A LAUDABLE GOAL WE OPPOSE THE BILL BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THE BILL CONFLICTED. SOMEONE IS CURRENTLY IN THE MARKETPLACE. BUT THE BUILDERS. ACCORD DATA FEDERAL RESERVE AND THE FDIC. FIVE AND 6% OF HOUSEHOLDS ARE COMING BACK WITH ANOTHER WIFE. OVER 94% OF HOUSEHOLDS ARE BANK. STATED THAT WE STILL FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT IF LAST WHICH IS LIKE REVIEWS HAVE BEEN ATTEMPTING TO BRING MORE SERVICES TO THIS POPULATION. THANK YOU THE ON BANK IS PRECISELY WHY CURRENT MEANS WE'LL START OVER A HUNDRED YEARS AGO. CREDIT UNION NOT FOR PROFIT MEMBER OWNED COOPERATIVES WITH THE GOAL OF SERVING THOSE OF MODEST MEANS. THIRTY ONE EIGHTY NINE CREDIT UNIONS HEADQUARTERED IN CALIFORNIA. IN EVERY CORNER OF THE STATE AND A VAST MAJORITY OF THESE CREDIT UNIONS OFFER LOCAL NO FEE CHECKING ACCOUNTS WITH FEATURES SIMILAR WHAT BANK CAL COUNCIL. WHERE DID YOU GET CREDIT USE THERE'S A NETWORK OF A HUNDRED FIFTY BANKS WILL ALSO FALL BUT SOMEWHERE CAL. MANY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ALSO PARTICIPATE IN A PROGRAM CALLED BANK ON WHICH IS RUN BY THE CITIES FOR FINANCIAL EMPOWERMENT. PROGRAMS GOLDEN STATE AND HAD THE BILL OR ONE OF THE SAME. ON BANK BANK. IT DOES SO BY OFFERING BANK ON CERTIFIED ACCOUNT AFTER DISPLAYING FINANCIAL INSTITUTION. LOW NOKIA CALIFORNIA'S NEW COMMUTING WHICH WHY DO YOU ALL FEEL BETTER MORE COST EFFECTIVE WEST BRICK LANE APPROACHES TO REDUCE POPULATION.

STARTING ITSELF AND WONDER IF THE STUDY SHOULD COME BEFORE THE COMPOSITION OF THE ACTUAL BOARD WE ALSO APPRECIATE THE PROPOSED AMENDMENT THAT REQUIRES FINAL APPROVAL BY THE LEGISLATURE- WE WOULD HOPE THAT THE APPROVAL WILL FALL UNDER THE PURVIEW OF THIS COMMITTEE GIVEN ITS EXPERTISE IN JURISDICTIONS. ULTIMATELY THOUGH AND ADEQUATE FEASIBILITY STUDY WHICH WE BELIEVE SHOULD BE FULLY FUNDED BY APPROPRIATIONS. MAY VERY WILL TELL YOU WHETHER OR NOT THE PROGRAM COULD BE SELF SUSTAINING WHETHER OR NOT IT MIGHT BE PROFITABLE OR BREAKEVEN. WHAT IT CAN'T TELL YOU OR THE INHERENT AND POTENTIAL RISKS THAT ARE HARD TO QUANTIFY. SO THE BANK CAL PROPOSES TO BE THE FACE OF BANKING FOR THE- USER. YES THERE WILL BE BACK IN A. UNITY AND OWNS THE CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP IT BECOMES THE RECIPIENT OF ALL THE CRITICISM FOR PROBLEMS THAT ARISE FROM THAT RELATIONSHIP. IF THERE ARE GLITCHES AND DEPOSITORS CAN'T ACCESS THEIR ACCOUNT. IT'S GOING TO BE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT RECEIVES THAT CRITICISM. BECAUSE BANK CALLOUS CORRECTING SENSITIVE INFORMATION IF THEIR DATA BREACHES OF CUSTOMER INFORMATION STOLEN IF THERE IS IDENTITY THEFT IF YOU USE THE STATE THE WILL ONLY LIABILITY DESPITE. PROVISIONS THAT HAVE BEEN ADDED TO THE BILL STATING OTHERWISE AND THESE ARE JUST EXAMPLES OF A MYRIAD OF POTENTIAL PROBLEMS THEY'RE VERY HARD TO CAPTURE IN THE FEASIBILITY STUDY SO.

MODERATOR ARE THERE ANY OTHER- WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION ON THE PHONE OR IN THE QUEUE. WE HAVE NO FURTHER COMMENT IN THE OPPOSITION Q. OKAY. ALL RIGHT FOR WE WILL NOT BRING THIS BACK TO THE COMMITTEE- FOR QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS WE WILL BEGIN WITH VICE CHAIR CHEN- THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR ON I WANT TO THANK. ASSEMBLY MEMBER SANTIAGO- FOR HIS DILIGENCE- BUT ALSO APPRECIATE THE INTENT OF THE BILL. TO BRING FINANCIAL EQUITY TO OUR UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. SPECIFICALLY ARE COMMITTEES AND A BROWN AND WHITE COMMUNITY. WITH THAT SAID THOUGH- THERE ARE EXACTLY TWO OR EIGHTY NINE CREDIT UNIONS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND A VAST MAJORITY OF THESE CREDIT UNIONS OFFER CHECKING ACCOUNTS. WITH NO FEES. AND A SECOND CHANCE OPPORTUNITIES. AND OF THESE TWO EIGHTY NINE INSTITUTION THERE HOW THIS CAL CREDIT UNIONS THAT HAVE A LOW INCOME DESIGNATION. AND TWENTY TWO OUR COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ARE BETTER KNOWN AS CDF FILES. THESE ARE THE NATION'S INDICATE A MAJORITY OF OUR MEMBERS MEET AT LOW INCOME THRESHOLD. AND THAT THE CREDIT UNION PROVIDES FINANCIAL SERVICES TO UNDERSERVED AS SAID BEFORE LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES. SO WITH THAT SAID DO YOU BELIEVE THAT BASED ON THIS BILL THAT THE POLICY STATED FOURTH IS DUPLICATIVE INDICTED FOR CREATING ANOTHER LAYER OF BUREAUCRACY WHEN THERE IS SOMETHING IN PLACE ALREADY. FOUR AS I BELIEVE THE TARGET AUDIENCE. THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO GET ACCESS TO- THE COMMISSION VICE CHAIR FOR THE QUESTION AND LOOK I DO WITH. THE GREAT WORK THE CREDIT YOU COMMUTE BANKS ARE DOING AND I SAID THAT PROBABLY WILL CONTINUE TO SAY THAT- THE FACT REMAINS THAT THERE IS AN UNDERBANKED AND UNBANKED POPULATION DOES NOT BE REACHED AND THAT IS THE POPULATION THAT WE ARE TRYING TO REACH- AND- SO RESPECTFULLY I WOULD SAY THAT WE- NEED. A BANK CAL. IT GIVES US THE ABILITY TO READ STOP POPULATION THAT HAS NOT BEEN REACHED. WE HAVEN'T THOUGHT ABOUT EXPANDING WHAT IS CURRENTLY IN PLACE- IN THE EFFORT TO REACH- YOUR YOUR- DESIRED TARGET AUDIENCE. WELL LET'S JUST. MAKE MATTERS MONSTER. CHECK THE IS- ONE APPROACH TO- THE OF THE THOSE WERE. OR UNDER. SO IN THIS CURRENT BILL FORMAT IS I UNDERSTAND- BUT YOU SAID YOU WANT TO BRING THE UNBANKED INDIVIDUALS- TO- OUR CURRENT- FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. WELL AS ALTERNATIVE BANKS SUCH AS ALTERNATIVE UNIONS BUT THEIR DEPOSITS ARE STILL GOING TO TRADITIONAL BANKS AND THEY WON'T ACTUALLY BANK AT BANK CAL RIGHT- THEY'RE GOING TO BE UTILIZING FOR CURRENT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS SO HOUSES BEING QUOTED AS A PUBLIC BANK. WELL I CAN TELL YOU WHAT IS RIGHT IN WE'RE CALLING IT UP BANK OPTION NOW. IT IS THERE IS A- AS I'VE DISCUSSED IN THAT. COULD BE A WEB BASED IS BUT WHAT THEY TREBLE BAY WE'RE INDIVIDUAL- CAN DEPOSIT- THEIR MONEY'S- IT WILL HAVE TO PARTNER UP WITH FINANCE IS- TO QUOTE UNQUOTE WORK THOSE DOLLARS- BUT ALSO REMIND YOU- THAT. THANK THANKS TO THE CHAIR AND THEIR HARD WORK THEY'VE ALLOWED US TO CRAFT LANGUAGE- IN A MARKET OR AND A MARKET STUDY- THAT WOULD DETERMINE- THE FEASIBILITY OF THIS PRODUCT IN IF THIS PRODUCT- IS SOUND PUBLIC POLICY THE LEGISLATURE WOULD HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY TO RATIFY IT SO- IS. SO WE'RE CONFIDENT- THAT THAT STUDY IN THE LEGISLATURE DESIRE TO MOVE FORWARD OR NOT MOVE FORWARD- WITH THAT- WILL CREATE THIS- BANK SO THERE ARE ALSO- THOSE. SAFEGUARDS IN PLACE. THIS THIS IS THE YOUR SAYING THE ONE AS WE COME BACK IN TWENTY TWO THREE. AND BASED ON THAT WILL STILL COME BY TO. THIS POLICY COMMITTEE- FOR PROVOKE I. THAT THE CAN. THAT WE HAVE HERE ARE STEVE CHAIR- HOW OF NEXT. IN BANKING FINANCE SERVICES. SO PERSONALLY I WOULD LIKE TO SEE A THROUGH THESE ACTS- AS OPPOSED TO IT. IT BECOMING A BUDGET BILL. WELL IT WILL COME BACK TO LEGISLATE. I CANNOT DETERMINE THE AMOUNT OF TIME I GET EXAMPLE IF MEMORY SERVES ME WELL- CAL SAVERS WAS MADE OF THE KING'S ABOUT FOUR YEARS BEFORE I CAME BACK AND IF I'M MISTAKEN ON THE AMOUNT OF TIME THEN THE STRUCTURE YOU CORRECTLY. THE BEST OF THE BEST OF MY- I BELIEVE THIS YEARS BEFORE IT CAME BACK- LOOK I'M OPEN TO DISCUSSIONS- ABOUT WHICH WAY IS THE BEST A BEST PARTICULAR APPROACH- IN. PARTICULAR QUESTION. I APPRECIATE THAT- IF I MAY- CHEN JUST. INTERRUPT HERE TO FOR MOM. IT IS THE INTENT OF THE CA. THAT THE FEASIBLE STUDY DOES RETURN BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE. AND SPECIFICALLY TO THIS COMMITTEE. WE CAN QUALIFY THAT IN THE LANGUAGES IT'S GOING FOR. THAT- THE OFFICE BEEN VERY WELL WORKABLE WITH THIS. AND WE'RE- IT IS OUR INTENT IF I UNDERSTAND IT. THAT THE ALLEGED. WILL PRODUCING LANGUAGE- FOR THE AMENDMENT THAT DOES BECAUSE THE BILL OR THE STUDY TO RETURN BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE. THAT SPECIFIC TO THE BANKING FINANCE COMMITTEE. FOR SOMEBODY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I APPRECIATE THAT- AND AS YOU STATED- THE SUMMER SANTIAGO. THAT WE NEED TO HAVE THESE FINANCIAL. INSTITUTIONS TO PARTICIPATE. IN A BANK CAL- ARE THERE INCENTIVES FOR THE FINANCIAL SUIT IS USED IT TO ME THE INSTITUTIONS TO PARTICIPATE IN BANK CAL- TO MAKE THIS. SUCCESSFUL YEAH I MEAN WHEN YOU PROCURE- LOOK LET'S OUR OFFICE WHAT. YES THERE IS- BECAUSE IF YOU PAY IT WHEN THE PROCUREMENT GOES OUT THAT WILL BE TURNED DETERMINED BY STATE- THEY WILL BE- REVENUE TO BE HAD. BY OUR FINANCIALS THE TO SAYS APART OR OTHERWISE THERE'S NO INCENTIVE FOR THEM TO DO IT RIGHT. BUT YOU KNOW I POINT TO THE MARKET ANALYSIS BECAUSE THE MARKET ANALYSIS REALLY TELL US- WITH THAT. WHICH WERE ARGUING- IS TRUE OR NOT I BELIEVE IT IS. THE FOR THE FAIRNESS OF THE FOR THE FAIRNESS O POLICY ARGUMENTS. THAT WILL INDICATE TO US- WHETHER IT DOES- FISCALLY PENCIL OUT WHICH BILLY IT DOES- IN BASED ON THAT THE LEGISLATURE. THAT FROM TO MOVE. OR NOT- A- HAVE. THAT QUESTION. THEN YES- THEY'LL BE A- THEY'LL BE THE OF THE- OF FOR FINANCE. IS. TO- TWO IN OUR REVENUE TO THAT WAY. THANK THANK YOU FOR YOUR AND AS I STATE EARLIER AND MY- IS THE OF HAVING FOR IS A PARTICIPATE IN ADDITION TO THOSE AND SO. I KNOW THAT IN BILL RIGHT NOW- ONE OF MAIN COME IS A STELLAR NINE. PUBLIC BANKING ON FOR INCLUDES BY MEMBERS FROM THE STATE TREASURER. OF THE COMMISSION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCIAL. AND INNOVATION IT'S ALSO GOING TO BE STAFF OR EMPLOYEES OF THE STATE TREASURER'S OFFICE SINCE THE FINANCIAL SOLUTIONS ARE SO CRITICAL IN THIS BILL HAS THERE BEEN THOUGHT OF EXPANDING THIS NINE MEMBER BOARD TO ADD FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THE INSTITUTIONS WOULD BE CREDIT UNIONS OR FINANCIAL BANKING SYSTEMS- THAT WILL BE INSTRUMENTAL TO MAKING. SURE THAT THIS BILL IS SUCCESSFUL. WELL I'M OPEN TO HAVE X. ON HERE- I'M NOT GONNA MAKE YOU KNOW KNOCKED ON HOW TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THIS NOW BUT I'M NOT GONNA INCLUDE- ANY AMENDMENTS OR OR COMMITMENTS OUTSIDE OF WORK- THE CHAIR HAS PROPOSED- IS SIMPLY BECAUSE WE'VE- WORKED ON THIS FOR ABOUT TWO MONTHS. AND I WANTED A I WANT TO BE RESPECTFUL TO WE'VE AGREED ON. ARM I DO ANOTHER- BUT I ALSO WOULD LIKE TO. ADD CERTAINLY I THINK HAVING FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS PART OF THAT COMMITTEE PART OF OUR BORDERS IS CREDIBLE. AND I WOULD- INDULGE AND ADDS TO THE CHAIR OF THERE'S A POSSIBILITY. OF ADDING THIS AMENDMENT- TO THIS BILL- AFTER. OVER MISTER CHAIR- MY LAST I WANT TO MAKE SURE THERE'S AN TIME FOR A OTHER COME MEMBERS HOW IS GOING TO. ENTER WITH THEIR K. BAG SERVICE. I'M SORRY ORE TIME I ABOUT THAT WITH THIS PROGRAM WITH CAN. YOU CAN- BANKING. A WORD BUT NOTHING IN THE BILL SAYS A CAN RECEIVE CANNABIS. TO HERE'S ONE OF THE CLARIFYING THANK YOU VERY MUCH. NEXT DR CHOI. IF YOU CHAIR AND ON SO- LET'S MEMBER SAID- STATE TALK- BE RETURNED ON BUT- I A TIME. ARE INTENT IS- CREATE. A PUBLIC BANK. SIR THAT- WILL MAKE UP. BANKS HE ACCESS OF. SO CALLED UNBANKED THE POPULATION SO- KNOWING PAPER OF WHATEVER REASON SO DURATION ARE CURRENT THANKS. OF IS NOT MEET THE NEED. THIS IN TURN THERE IS A GOOD. HOW WELL HOWEVER. ONCE WE CREATE SUCH A PUBLIC BANKING SYSTEM. A READING SOME OF THE ANALYSIS- I AGREED TO. LIKE A NEXT A SIX YEARS. ALL THE COST WOULD BE- ONE BY THE STATE. AND THEN I CAN PREDICT. THE. ALSO THE- MORE THAN THE REVENUE. AND THE ORDER BE UNDETERMINED AMOUNT OF- PUBLIC DOLLARS PUBLIC TAX DOLLARS TO SUPPORT THIS SYSTEM. AND I ONE DAY FOR ANYBODY HAS OF. ESTIMATED THAT A QUARTER FIGURE. HOW MUCH HE REVENUE LOS WILL BE ANTICIPATED. I WONDER WHATEVER THAT THE AMOUNT THAT MAY BE. IF WE CAN- IDEA IS THAT THE- CURRENT BANKING SYSTEM. DURATION ARE BANKS OR CREDIT UNIONS. WOULD BE INCENTIVIZED FOR THEM TO CREATE THE SPECIAL. OUR GRAHAM. FOR LOWER INCOME CATEGORY PEOPLE. TO PROVIDE SUCH AS A. HE A BILL INTENDED TO. IT'LL BE. VOLUNTARY THIS IS ALL OF NINETEEN SOLVE ON TORY. ZERO THREE ZERO PENALTY. OKAY I KNOW MOST OF THE BANKS THEY HAVE A CERTAIN CONDITIONS SO IF YOU DON'T MEET THAT THE SUDDEN BALANCE ARE DONE I SHALL PAY A CIVIL PENALTY. BUT THE IF TESSA. OVERDRAFT AMOUNT- OVER DRUG OVERDOSE THE CHECK ITSELF DIRECTED AND UP LOSS INCURRED. AND ARE WE NOT. IS THAT ENCOURAGING THEM PICKED TO DO CONTINUE TO DO SO I THEN THAT THE LOSS OR THE PAID FOR BY. THE TAX. AND IF WE ARE DETERMINED. HOW CAN WE. INCENTIVIZE A TRADITIONAL BANK SO TO PROVIDE THE SPECIAL PROGRAM. AND WHAT THE NORMAL NORMAL YOUR COST- TO ACCOUNT. FOUR MMHM I DON'T KNOW ZERO PENALTY THAT BOTHERS ME A LOT- THIS IS A CREATES A S. ON OCT ENCOURAGEMENT OF OUR- ABUSING OFFICE OUR SYSTEM. IN THE IT CAN BE.

SHOLA I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THIS BE A LAW IF IT PASSES WHICH ARE I DON'T THINK A AGAIN SUPPORT AT THIS TIME. IF IT. DOES PASSED SO BY THE DAY THIS WILL ALLOW TO CREATE OR THE NINETY NINE MEMBER BOARD MEMBERS OR DO FITS TEST THIRTY ALONE. WHICH WATERS DID.

FOR ALL DRAFT EITHER IT SO WE JUST I THINK THERE'S A PHENOMENAL IN THE WAY WE VIEW THE- BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT AGE DOES TO YOU. YEAH THERE'S A NUMBER OF THINGS OF THE MARKET ANALYSIS- WE'LL TAKE A LOOK AT- THE NUMBER OF POTENTIAL ACCOUNT HOLDERS- THE AVAILABILITY OF QUALIFIED PARTICIPANT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. POTENTIAL ACCOUNT HOLDERS- COMFORT WITH- VARIOUS BANKING PRODUCTS HOW INDIVIDUALS WITH FEDERAL FIGHT WITHOUT FEDERAL OR STATE VOTER IDENTIFICATION TO PARTICIPATE- POTENTIAL PROGRAM REVENUE STREAMS- THE PRESENCE OF PRIVATE SECTOR OR NONPROFIT- COMPETITORS TO THE PROGRAM- THE FISCAL RISK- FROM THE PROGRAM- DURING ECONOMIC DOWNTURNS. AND OTHER FACTORS THAT TO DO THAT THAT ARE DEEMED RELEVANT ALL THESE AND OTHERS ARE GEARED TOWARDS- ASKING THE QUESTION IS THIS FEASIBLE OR NOT- IF THE- IF THE MARKET IN. TO TURN THAT IT IS FEES. I THINK A LOT OF QUESTIONS THAT MAY HAVE BEEN RAISED- DURING YOUR COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS- WOULD BE ADDRESS MEANING IT IS SOUND FISCAL POLICY NOT IF IT IS NOT. IF IT IS NOT THE MARKET ANALYSIS WOULD ALSO TELL US THAT IT'S NOT. HAVING SAID THAT ONCE THE MARKET ANALYSIS IS DONE. IT WOULD COME BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE IN THE LEGISLATURE HAS THE ULTIMATE AUTHORITY TO PROCEED OR NOT PROCEED- YOU MENTION THEM- ALL THE FOLKS OF THIS. I THINK ADDRESSES A LOT OF THE LIABILITY QUESTIONS A TO BEGIN WITH AND THEN ALLEGEDLY AGAIN HAS THE ABILITY APPLYING. TO MOVE FORWARD OR NOT. NOW HAVING SAID THAT. YOU KNOW THE DATE THERE IS PRETTY IN THIS THAT WE WRITTEN- WOULD BRING ABOUT THE FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY MEANING LIABILITY. TO THOSE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS UPPER CARE- ED IN WE WORKED EXTREMELY HARD TO GET THERE I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR AGAIN FOR HELPING US TO INSERT THAT IN THERE WHICH WAS. INCREDIBLE WORK AND I'M ALMOST OUT SAYING THAT- IN THE OTHER PIECE OF IT TOO IS. I YOU KNOW IT YOU WE WOULD HAVE TO COME BACK. IF THERE IF THERE IS A COST IN THE WILL BE HIS NEXT TO ME COULD BE BETWEEN THREE TO FIVE MILLION TO SET UP I'M NOT GONNA HIDE THE BALL- BUT WE WOULD HAVE TO MAKE THOSE ARGUMENTS BEFORE A BUDGET COMMITTEE- AND- WE WOULD HAVE TO BE BACKED. BY DATA MEANING FEASIBILITY. MARKET ANALYSIS THAT THIS IS ACTUALLY SOUND. SO THIS IS NOT A FREE CHECK TO GO DO ANYTHING. THIS IS A. WASTE A SERIES AS- ALL THE- TO. ENSURE THAT WE PER- THESE SERVICES- PEOPLE- WITHOUT PENALTIES WITHOUT FEES XCERRA EVEN THOUGH WE MAY HAVE TO DISAGREE ON THAT- BUT- INSURING THAT IT THERE IS THAT THAT IN IS FISCALLY SOUND IS NOT MY INTEREST. NOR THE LEGISLATURE'S INTEREST TO PROCEED FORWARD WITH ANY PRODUCT THAT IS GOING TO CAUSE A LIABILITY- BECAUSE WE ARE WE ARE STEWARDS OF THE PUBLIC DOLLAR AND NUMBER TWO- WE WANTED TO WORK TO GIVE THAT PRODUCT THAT THAT WE ARE TRYING TO ACHIEVE. WITH THIS BILL- AND WHICH IS WHY THERE ARE MANY SAFEGUARDS IN THEIR. THANK YOU AND WE WILL NOW GO TO ASSEMBLYMEMBER BURKE FOR QUESTIONS. FIRST I WANT TO THINK- THE AUTHOR I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE ENTERED AN ENDING QUESTIONS FOR THE LAST FEW DAYS AND- FOR ME AND OTHER COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND I WANT TO THANK YOU I ALSO WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR FOR- BEING VERY RESPONSIVE TO THE- TO MY CONCERNS I DON'T SPEAK FOR ANYBODY ELSE BUT I APPRECIATE THAT. AND I JUST I WANNA MAKE SURE EXPRESS MADE. OPINION ON IS THEY DON'T HAVE A PHILOSOPHICAL ISSUE OR CONCERN WITH THE IDEA OF A PUBLIC BANK AND I WOULD LOVE THERE TO BE A PLACE WHERE PEOPLE CAN CASH THEIR CHECKS WITH AT NO COST AND ALL THE OTHER THREE THINGS THAT WOULD COME UP WITH. A SERVICE LIKE THAT HOWEVER. I AM CAN. ABOUT USING HARD WORKING PEOPLES FUNDS TO SEE THAT A PUBLIC BANK AND I UNDERSTAND A TRADITIONAL BANK WILL BE THE FACILITY QUOTED TWELVE FACILITATOR OF. YOU KNOW TRANSACTIONS BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THERE A IS THE GOAL IS THAT THE DEPOSITORY BE A PUBLIC OR SEVERAL PUBLIC BANKS AND I KNOW THAT WE PUT IN PROCESS IN THE LAST FEW YEARS- VERY STRINGENT GOD LET GUIDELINES ON CREATING THOSE PUBLIC BANKS BUT I. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THIS MONEY WOULD PROBABLY THE DEPOSITORY MONEY WOULD BE USED TOWARDS. THAT PROCESS AND SO I JUST WANNA. MAKE SURE IT'S ON THE TABLE THAT I HAVE GREAT CONCERN ABOUT THAT- SO I JUST. SO THE SAFEGUARDS ARE IMPORTANT TO ME. AND TO BE ABLE TO VOTE FOR THIS BILL SO FIRST I THINK YOU FOR BEING WILLING TO TAKE. THE AMENDMENT HAT ACTUALLY ANALYZES WHAT EVEN IF THE REPORT SYS. YES THIS LOOKS LIKE IT COULD WORK WE ALL KNOW AND ANY OF US WHO ARE IN THE FINANCIAL INDUSTRY DURING THE CRASH NO THAT. THING SOMETIMES DON'T WORK EVEN WHEN WE THINK THEY WILL BE ON. THE STATE WILL HAVE A CERTAIN LEVEL OF FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITY AND THAT THAT HAS BEEN ANALYZED IN ADVANCE I THINK IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT SO I APPRECIATE. YOU BILLING WILLING TO TAKE THAT. I ALSO APPRECIATE THE CHERISH CLARIFICATION THAT THE BILL WILL NOT JUST COME BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE BUT WE'LL COME BACK TO BOTH. OF THAT BOTH THE SENATE AND THE ASSEMBLY BANKING COMMITTEES FOR A FULL REVIEW AND APPROVAL I THINK THAT'S INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT I THINK IT'S- AS MY COLLEAGUE SAID IT'S IMPORTANT THAT IT'S NOT. YET SLID INTO A TROUBLE BUT PROPERLY ANALYZED BY THOSE WHO ARE EXPERTS IN ANALYZING. THE SORT OF THINGS. I SAY IT ONE LAST AND THAT IS TO THE BOARD I. HADN'T EVEN THOUGHT ABOUT THE BOARD MEMBERS INSTILL. INTO CONVERSATION LAST NIGHT. AND UNDERSTANDING THAT. THE DEPOSITORY IS NOT ACTUALLY A TRADITIONAL BANK AND THIS BOARD WOULD ACTUALLY BE RUNNING A FINANCIAL INSTITUTION. IT IS CONCERNING TO ME. THAT THERE IS NOT. A CERTAIN THRESHOLD OF FINANCIAL EXPERTS ON THAT BOARD ESPECIALLY. SINCE THE STATE REALLY. AT SOME LEVEL BE. BEYOND THE FTA. AND SO I KNOW YOU DO WANT THE WHOLE BOARD TO BE AND I UNDERSTAND THAT TO BE FINANCED EXPERTS I DON'T EITHER I THINK THAT THERE. GREAT BY. IN A TO. OF FIRST. ON BOARD- AND IT IS THE- POINT BUT I WANNA. COMMIT THAT THAT I AM VERY CONCERNED. IT AND THAT THAT IT SHOULD NEED A FRESH. ON THIS IS A HUGE. BILLION STOPPING. WORKING PEOPLE TO DO. DON'T YOU ARE HARD EARNED DOLLARS TO SEE THIS. OF RESPONSE. AND SO. HAVING PEOPLE ON THAT BOARD THAT REALLY UNDERSTAND AND CAN REALLY GUIDE THIS PROCESS I THINK IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT AND SO. I DON'T. I'M NOT TRYING TO I DON'T WANT TO JAM YOU BUT I WANT TO MAKE IT VERY VERY CLEAR THAT I THINK THAT THAT IS IT WOULD BE IRRESPONSIBLE ON SOME LEVEL FOR US NOT TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION AND NOT TO REALLY PUSH THAT ISSUE A LITTLE BIT FURTHER. THAN IT'S BEEN DISCUSSED HERE TODAY BUT OTHER THAN THAT I APPRECIATE. THE LOW THE LATE THE DISTANCE YOU COME IN THE LAST TWENTY FOUR HOURS BECAUSE IT IS FAR. AND I WANT THAT TO BE ACKNOWLEDGE AND I WANTED TO BE APPRECIATED BECAUSE THEY DO IT I DON'T KNOW THAT. I COULD HAVE SUPPORTED IT WITHOUT THOSE SAFE RAIL SO I APPRECIATE THAT. THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS AND WE WILL NOW GO TO ASSEMBLY. COUNTY BETWEEN. THANK YOU MISTER AND THAT IF YOU CAN HEAR ME THIS IS I ALSO WANT TO COMMEND- THE AUTHOR OR- THE GOLD OF THE SPELL AND CERTAINLY. THE GOALS OF THE SPELL IT DO YOU HAVE A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS THAT YOU KNOW WE HAVE HAVE DISCUSSED AND THAT I YOU WANT TO THE YOU KNOW WITH WITH WITH ME AS A WHOLE. I'M. SO I'M JUST GONNA. WITH CAN. OUT THAT. THE CHEAPEST OFFICER FOR THE STATE OF. OUR STATE COMPTROLLER. OPPOSES THIS. AND THAT GIVES ME SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE FOR PAUSE I'M IN HER LETTER ABOUT SHE WRITES THAT THIS WILL EXPOSE THE TO EXCESSIVE AND BUT NOW AND LEGAL- SHE ALSO KNOWS THERE ARE MORE. LESS RISK AND COST ALTER. THAT EXIST TO ACCOMPLISH THIS BILLS BOTH. WHICH I HAVE TO SAY THAN AS A MIGRATED I'M- SO IT'S LIKE I SAID SEEING THAT THIS A PO BY OUR CHIEF OFFICER ME SICKENING PA. DEDUCTED THAT GIVE YOU PAUSE DO YOU DID YOU READ THAT GO GOSH THE- THAT. MAN FROM YES. I WOULD IT LOOKS THE WEIGHT WILL HAVE TO GO TO THE CHAIR NEXT WE DO AND WE- YEAH. SO I MEAN- IT DOES CONCERN ME WHICH IS WHY I THINK MARKET RATE- MARKET. IS BECAUSE IT WILL ALL TO DID- WHAT OR NOT THIS US FISCAL. AND LET REVIEW. OF WHAT. WILL OF BALL WILL DETERMINE ITS DECISION. OUR AT SEVERAL I THINK THE AT THE FOLKS WHO SPOKE ON BEHALF OF THE IN- SOME OF THE OTHER FOR WHO WAITED IN ENOUGH. HI HAVE SHARED THE PERFECT THAT- IF GOAL IS TO AND THAT YOU KNOW WE REACH ALL AND BANGKOK ARE IS I THINK OF WILL SHARE THAT THERE ARE MANY AGAIN RISKY LESS COSTLY ALTERNATIVES TO COME THAT GOAL. IT IS YOU ALL WERE WORKING THIS PURPOSE HAVE YOU. THE ALTERNATE OF THE GROUP'S ONE ON ANY AND ALL ALTERNATIVES BUT I STRONGLY THAT THIS HELP- IN THAT GOAL. OKAY AND CAN I ACTUALLY ARE ANOTHER I DON'T KNOW THE IS RT MOSCOW MISTER CHAIR COULD YOU DO YOU ASK FOR A RAISE THE BOY COMMANDS ABOUT THAT CAN YOU NOT IT SORRY THANK YOU SORRY MR CAN'T I'M IN THE IN YOUR OPENING YOU THIS ISN'T A- CAN YOU HELP UNDERSTAND THAT COULD SOMETIMES WE TO THIS IS UP PAYING YOUR OPEN YOUR YOU MADE THE POINT THAT IT'S NOT A BANK SO CAN YOU HELP US CLARIFY THAT. CORRECT SO BANK WOULD BE THE IS DO WELL BE IN A THAT DOES- WELL THAT THE YOU DEPOSIT MONEY IN THE DOESN'T IN YOU DO ALL THE RETAIL AND SO FOR- IN THE WAY WE THIS IN THE WAY WE HAD WROTE IT YOU HAVE A PLAQUE. THE IS THE IS THE PUBLIC GOES HAVE A INTERFACE THE BACKSIDE OF IT SOURCE WE BE THAT FINANCIAL TO THAT QUOTE UNQUOTE WORKS ALL AND THAT WORKS DOLLAR HOLDS OUT DOLLARS WE'RE NOT IN A IT WAS OVER NOT A STAB DECREASE OF A BANG AND- NOT APPLES TO BUT OUR TWO ONE- BY- CAL SAVERS YOU EIGHT. WHICH IS WHICH WOULDN'T HE FINING TO- DOES THE. UNDER OKAY. OKAY AB. AND THEN LASTLY BY CAN JUST MAKE SURE IN THIS WHERE. THEY MEASURE GOT. TO AND I'M I KNOW WE HAD SOME LATE AMENDMENTS LAST NIGHT SO I AM NOT A 100% CLEAR SO WE HAVE THE FEASIBILITY STUDY I KNOW THERE IS QUITE A BIT OF DISCUSSION ABOUT IT COMING BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE JUST FOR REVIEW OR IS IT COMING BACK. FOR REVIEW AND APPROVAL. IS IT COMING BACK FOR REVIEW AND APPROVAL NOW IS THAT THE LATEST AMENDMENTS. IT IS. YES IF YOU DON'T MIND ALTHOUGH. SO THE ROOF- THE FEASIBILITY STUDY WILL COME BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE SPECIFICALLY AS WAS MENTIONED TO COMMITTEES. OF FOR NOT ONLY REVIEW BEFORE RATIFICATION FOR ABOUT- TO ACCEPT IT IF I pUNDERSTAND THE LANGUAGE CORRECTLY. IS RATIFICATION THE RIGHT WORD. OKAY TO RATIFY TO VOTE ON IT. AS FAR AS WHETHER TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS. WITH WHAT THE STUDY RECOMMENDS AND THEN ALSO TO- THE REASON FOR BRING IT BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE AS WELL. IS TO MAKING THE STATUE CHANGES THAT MIGHT NEED TO BE MADE BECAUSE OF THE STUDY- IF IT THE STUDY FOUND THAT IT WAS GOING TO WORK. IF THESE THINGS CHANGED. THEN THE LEGISLATURE THEN HAS THE ABILITY. AT THAT POINT TO ACT UPON THE RECOMMENDATIONS. OF THE STUDY. OR THE OR THE LEGISLATURE. AND COMMITTEES COULD REJECT THE STAFF. THANK YOU FOR RESPONDING AND THANK YOU FOR CLARIFYING AND MISTER CHALLENGES ADD TO THAT THAT THAT. IT WOULD STILL REQUIRE US IF THERE IF THERE IS THAT- IF THERE IS A BUNCH OF OPERATIONS TO GO AFTER I TOOK. THIS BILL STILL IS JUST ONE STEP IT'LL TAKE A COUPLE OF A FEW OTHER STEPS AND IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY THE LETTER THAT YOU WERE YOU WERE REFERRING TO. A TALK ABOUT THE CREATION OF A PUBLIC BANK THIS IS NOT THAT. UNDERSTOOD I THINK. THERE'S CONFUSION BECAUSE IT'S CALLED. CAL BANK SO IT'S KIND OF EASY TO. CALL THE BANK WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IT. AND THAT'S ALL FOR ME BUT THANK YOU I APPRECIATE. YOUR ANSWER MY QUESTIONS AND I APPRECIATE YOUR- BY. ENGAGEMENT AND COLLABORATION THROUGHOUT THIS PROCESS. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER PETRIE-NORRIS AND JUST TO CLARIFY. WE CAN'T PREDICT OR- OR SAY WHAT THE LEGISLATURE IS GOING TO DO. ONCE IT COMES BACK. SO REALLY IT'S UP TO THE COMMITTEE AT THAT TIME. AND THE LEGISLATURE AT THAT TIME TO DECIDE. WHAT THEY WANT TO DO WITH IT IT JUST COMES BACK TO THE- SO DOES THAT MAKE SENSE. OKAY WITH THAT- SOME REMEMBER GABRIEL YOU WERE NEXT AND THEN WE'LL FOLLOW UP WITH- A- SOME OF OUR CAMP. FIGURE FIRST. OKAY PLEASE GO AHEAD- THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I ALSO WANT TO JUST REITERATE MY GRATITUDE TO THE AUTHOR- FOR THE GOAL I MEAN I'VE HAD CALLS WITH THE OPPOSITION WHERE THEY SAID WELL IT'S ONLY 5% OF CALIFORNIA THAT'S ON BANK INTO ME THAT'S TOO MUCH RIGHT AND SO I THINK EVEN THOUGH WHETHER THAT ESTIMATE IS RIGHT OR WRONG WHOSE NUMBERS ARE RIGHT WHATEVER POPULATION IN CALIFORNIA IS UNBANKED OR UNDERBANKED IS TOO MUCH. AND YOU'RE REALLY TRYING TO ADDRESS THAT HERE AND I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT AND IT'S A GOAL THAT I HOPE I THINK MANY OF US HERE SHARE I ALSO DO WANT TO REITERATE MY GRATITUDE TO THE COMMITTEE AND THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR HARD WORK ON THIS- AND I AM INCREDIBLY GRATEFUL THAT IT IS GOING TO COME BACK TO US FOR RATIFICATION IS YOU SAID IN YOUR WORDS MR SANTIAGO WE ARE THE STEWARDS OF THE PUBLIC DOLLARS. AND NOT THIS BOARD THAT IS BEING SET UP AND SO IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE AS THOSE STORIES OF THE PEOPLE ACTED BY THE FORTY MILLION PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA MAKE THE ULTIMATE DETERMINATION OF WHETHER THIS-IS APPROPRIATE OR NOT SO THANK YOU FOR THAT COMMITMENT. I DO WANT TO ECHO MY COLLEAGUES SO YOU KNOW A FEW OF US HERE HAVE ABOUT EIGHT MORE YEARS NINE MORE YEARS IN THIS LEGISLATURE THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE MANY OF US WILL BE HERE WHEN THIS COMES BACK AND THE BOARD COMPOSITION IS SOMETHING THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO ME AND CURRENTLY AS I READ IT ONLY ONE MAYBE TWO OF THESE FOLKS ARE BANKING EXPERTS ONE HAS A BANKING EXPERTISE THE OTHER IS A- IT SAID A- THEY- WORK FOR. ADVOCATE FOR THE BANKS- SO MAYBE THAT PERSON WOULD ALSO A BAKING EXPERTISE AND NINE. AND WHEN THIS COMES BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE I THINK IT IS CRITICAL THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS FAITH IN THIS FEASIBILITY STUDY. AND SO THE COMPOSITION OF THE BOARD NOT ONLY IS IMPORTANT TO US HERE TODAY BUT I BELIEVE IT WILL BE IMPORTANT FOR LEGISLATORS TO VOTE ON THIS IN THE FUTURE. AND SO THE INTEGRITY OF THE STUDY IS CRITICAL I THINK TO A GOAL YOU'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE. AND I THINK THAT CHANGING THE COMPOSITION I SUGGESTED BY MANY MEMBERS HERE. WILL HELP THIS GOAL. WILL MAKE SURE THAT THE FEASIBILITY STUDY IS TRUSTED BY THE FUTURE LEGISLATURE. AND HOPEFULLY IF IT'S SURE TO BE FEASIBLE. WILL BE ACTED UPON- I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS ONE IS. THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF CONFUSION ABOUT THE DEPOSITORY I HEARD YOU SAY THAT THE DEPOSITARY HAD TO BE FDIC INSURED. THANK YOU RIGHT THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTION I KNOW THAT IT THAT IT AYE I USE THE WORD PARTNER BUT OBVIOUSLY BRAG HERE. WOULD HAVE TO WOULD HAVE TO BE FDIC INSURED AND ALL THIS AND ALL THE- ALL THE SAFEGUARDS TO ANY. BANK COMMUNITY BANK OR CREDIT UNION. WOULD HAVE TO TAKE ON WE WOULD EXPECT. WHOEVER PARTNERS UP WOULD HAVE THOSE SAME SORT OF- BUT- PROTECTIONS AND ABIDE BY RULES. SO I KNOW THAT THE BILL SAYS THAT THE INSTITUTION AFTER FIVE. HAS TO COMPLY WITH ALL FEDERAL STATE LAWS AND TO ME IT WAS ACTUALLY NOT CLEAR. WHETHER THAT MEANT THAT THE INSTITUTION HAD BE FDIC INSURED AND SO I THINK THERE'S ROOM IN THE LANGUAGE TO CLARIFY WHAT YOU'RE SAYING AND I WOULD APPRECIATE THAT- I ALSO ASSUME THAT ONE OF THE OPTIONS FOR THAT INSTITUTION IS A PUBLIC BANK- I. MY UNDERSTANDING OF THAT IS THAT THAT PUBLIC BANK WOULD HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE PROCESS WE SET UP IN AB FIFTY SEVEN IN ORDER TO BE AN OPTION. FOR THE PARTNER IS THAT YOUR UNDERSTANDING. HELLO HAVE TO BE SET UP IT WOULD HAVE TO WORK BUT- I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING UP THE STATE. AND FEDERAL WE JUST. THE SOONER WE SAID FEDERAL IT WOULD CAPTURE ALL THE DIFFERENT LAWS THAT ARE UNDER FEDERAL INCLUDING FBI INSERTED FTI SEE INSURED. AND WHEN WE MET STATE- I KNOW IT'S THE D. DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS OVERSIGHT STRANGE TO NAME BUT ALL THAT INCLUDES- THROUGHOUT THAT PROCESS AS WELL. MANY LAWS THAT MAY BE IN THE BOOKS OKAY THANK YOU FOR CLARIFYING THAT AND SO LASTLY I WANT TO TOUCH ON THE FEASIBILITY STUDY AND WHAT IT LOOKS THAT- CURRENTLY WITH MISS. BURKE'S AMENDMENT AND OFFENSIVE CALL YOUR MEMBER OR NOT BUT- IT WAS. THREE THINGS. RATE WHETHER CAN BE IMPLEMENTED WHETHER IT CAN PAY FOR ITSELF WITHIN SIX YEARS AND THEN WHETHER THERE'S RISK IN A DOWNTURN. I THINK THAT ACTUALLY MISSED BETWEEN OUR SORT OF TOUCHED ON THE THING THAT I WAS FOCUSED ON THAT'S MISSING FROM THE FEASIBILITY STUDY. WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT AND THE CONTROLLER TALKED ABOUT WHICH- IS THERE A LESS RISKY AND LESS COSTLY ALTERNATIVE IS THIS THE RIGHT SOLUTION. RIGHT I MEAN EVEN THOUGH I'M ON BOARD WITH WHAT. WITH THE GOAL OF THIS BILL I THINK THAT TO THE EXTENT THAT WERE DOING THIS STUDY. WE SHOULD BE DOING THE STUDY TO MEANINGFUL WAY TO DECIDE WHAT THE BEST WAY TO ACHIEVE OUR GOAL IS. RATHER THAN DICTATING WHAT WE THINK THE ANSWER IS I THINK WE SHOULD BE OPEN TO OTHER ANSWERS. AND SO I WOULD REALLY URGE THAT THE FINAL AMENDMENT TO THIS B. WE ASK THAT WE ADDED AN ANALYSIS OF. OTHER ALTERNATIVES THEY. MAY BE LESS RISKY AND LESS COSTLY. BUT WE THOUGHT WE COVERED THAT WORK SAYS. AND I DON'T WANT. TO NEGOTIATE ANYTHING OUTSIDE OF WHAT THE CHAIRS ALREADY ASKED US TO TAKE BECAUSE- THIS IS WHAT THIS IS WHAT WAS ASKED BUT- WHEN. WHEN I SAW THAT PAUL DOES ABOUT- MY GLASSES GIVE FONG. THE PRESENCE OF A REAL WHETHER THE PRESENCE OF PRIVATE SECTOR OR NON. NONPROFIT COMPETITORS TO THE PROGRAM IF THAT QUESTION IS ANSWERED THE LEGISLATURE COULD DETERMINE TO MOVE FORWARD OR NOT. SO WE INCLUDED IT BECAUSE IT WILL HAVE TO ANSWER WHETHER THERE ARE PRIVATE COMPETITORS. OR NONPROFIT COMPETITORS TO THE PROGRAM UP SO IF. THEY'LL HAVE TO STATE THOSE RATE SO YOU HAVE IT IN THE MARKET ANALYSIS YOU'RE READING FROM THE SECTION OF WHAT THE MARKET ANALYSIS SHOULD INCLUDE WHICH DOES INCLUDE THAT OF WHAT THE ALT pMARKET. AND THEY'RE BEING OTHER THINGS ON THE MARKET COULD STILL MAKE THIS FEASIBLE BY THE DEFINITION OF THAT IT'S IMPLEMENTABLE THAT IS NOT RISKING A DOWNTURN AND THAT IT CAN PAY FOR ITSELF IN SIX YEARS. THAT IS NOT TO SAY THAT WE CAN DO IT IN A MORE FISCALLY CONSERVATIVE. AND RISK LAST RISKY WAY AND I THINK THAT THAT IS AN IMPORTANT QUESTION THAT WE SHOULD BE ASKING YOU THE FEASIBILITY STUDY WHICH WOULD BE NOT IN THE MARKET ANALYSIS SECTION BUT IN THAT SECTION. THEY CURRENTLY ONLY HAS TWO PARTS BUT WILL NOW HAVE A THIRD PART AND I THINK THAT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT QUESTION WE SHOULDN'T PREDETERMINE THE ANSWER TO HOW TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM. SO I URGE YOU TO CONSIDER THAT MOVING. FORWARD THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU THIS ASSEMBLY MEMBER DAVID. YES THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND- I THINK OF MY COLLEAGUES HERE OF RAISED A LOT OF- A LOT OF MY CONCERNS AND I WANT TO FIRST THANK THE AUTHOR- PERSON VERY GOOD CONVERSATIONS THAT WE HAD LAST NIGHT THAT I HAD WITH YOU AND ALSO WITH. SOME OF THE SPONSORS AND- YOU JUST SAY FROM THE FROM THE OUTSET THAT I. I DO UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO. AND I THINK THAT THERE IS- AS OUR AS OUR COLLEAGUE SAID- IMPORTANT OPPORTUNITY HERE TO PROVIDE FINANCIAL SERVICES TO COMMUNITIES THAT DON'T HAVE THEM. I LIKE THE IDEA OF COMPETITION I THINK THIS IS A VERY INTRIGUING IDEA AND ONE. THAT IS DEFINITELY WORTHY OF CONSIDERATION. DONOVAN AID. I THINK WHAT YOU'RE HEARING FROM A LOT OF FOLKS TODAY AND FOR MYSELF IS THAT WE DON'T WANT TO TAKE. A BIG GAMBLE. WITH TAXPAYER MONEY. AND WITH THE SAVINGS OF LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES WORKING FAMILIES. THAT WE WANT UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S GONNA WORK OUT. AND WE CAN FEEL GOOD ABOUT AND THERE'S A LOT OF CONCERNS. ON A LOT OF DIFFERENT LEVELS HERE SO. FIRST OF ALL I APPRECIATE THE COMMITMENT TO BRING THAT BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE THINK BEFORE GOING TO. EMBARK ON THE STAFF AND TO DO SOMETHING THAT'S BIG WE HAVE TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO STUDY THAT TYPE OF. FEES ABOUT USABILITY ANALYSIS IN DETAIL- I THINK THE COMMENT. FROM OUR COLLEAGUE FROM AROUND ABOUT ADDING. ALTERNATIVE SIX. OFF HERE TO ACHIEVE THESE GOALS WHICH ARE VERY LAUDABLE AND WORTHY GOALS- IS AN ACCENT WANTED STARTING CARD YOU TO CONSIDER THAT. LET'S LET'S DO A REALLY THOROUGH ANALYSIS. AND LET'S NOT POINTED IN ONE DIRECTION OR THE OTHER LET'S LET'S CALL THE QUESTION. GET EXPERTS TO WEIGH IN. AND TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE BEST WAY IS TO DELIVER THE SERVICES BECAUSE THESE THESE COMMUNITIES DESERVE THOSE SERVICES. I DO I DO SHARE THE SAME CONCERNS ABOUT- AFTER INSURANCE I THINK READING THAT IN SPECIFICALLY TO THE LANGUAGE WOULD BE. WOULD BE HELPFUL- I DID ALSO WANT TO RAISE THE ISSUE OF THE COMPOSITION THE BOARD OF SOMETHING. I SPOKE WITH YOU ABOUT LAST NIGHT. BUT NOT FOR ME A BIG. WITH A- RED. HERE I THINK WE NEED TO. BE ALL AND BE A SH. THAT THE PEOPLE. THIS WITH. TO HAVE EXPERT. IN THOSE SERVICES AT ALL OF THE ISSUES THAT YOU IDENTIFIED. FOCUSING ON EQUITY. FOCUSING ON LABOR FOCUSING ON SMALL BUSINESSES I THINK THAT I. I WOULD SUGGEST WE RIGHT INTO THE STATUTORY LANGUAGE ABOUT THE MISSION OF THIS. ENTERPRISE IF WE DO GO FORWARD WITH IT. NOT TO FOCUS ON THOSE THINGS. BUT WE NEED TO FEEL CONFIDENT THAT THE PEOPLE RUNNING THE ENTERPRISE. HAD THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF EXPERTISE AND SO. I DO UNDERSTAND THE CONCERN ABOUT BRINGING IN PEOPLE FROM OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS YOU DON'T WANT- THE BOARD TO BE MADE UP OF COMPETITORS WHO ARE. NOT GONNA BE ACTING IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF THIS INSTITUTION. BUT WHAT I HEARD YOU LAST NIGHT WHICH WANT TO SUGGEST PUBLICLY. I THINK WE HAVE A- WEALTH OF KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERTISE IN BANKING ISSUES IN OUR- IN OUR IN. IN ACADEMIA. AND FOLKS ARE THINK ABOUT. THAT JANET YELLEN OUR CURRENT. SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY THE WITH. A PROFESSOR AT UC BERKELEY BEFORE THAT. RAFAEL BOSTIC WITH THE PRESIDENT OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE. BANK OF ATLANTA WITH A PROFESSOR AT USC KATIE PORTER WHO IS A PROFESSOR AT UC IRVINE. THERE ARE PEOPLE WITH DEEP SOPHISTICATED KNOWLEDGE OF HOW TO RUN. FINANCIAL ENTERPRISES. THAT CAN HELP DIRECT THIS AND PUT THIS ON THE RIGHT PATH. AND I REALLY NEED PEOPLE WITH EXPERTISE TO RUN THE PEOPLE WITH EXPERTISE IN COMPLIANCE. PEOPLE EXPERTISE AND FRAUD PREVENTION PEOPLE UNDERSTAND. OUR FINANCIAL MARKETS CAPITAL MARKETS THAT. THE TREASURY YIELD CURVE ALL THE THINGS THAT ARE CENTRAL. TO RUNNING THIS TYPE OF ENTERPRISE CLOUD. IT'S GOING TO BE VERY IMPORTANT ME I'M GONNA VOTE FOR THIS TODAY. AS AS AS I TALKING ABOUT I HAVE. CONFIDENCE THAT YOU IN THE SPOTS ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK TO SHAKE THIS AND REFINED UP AND MAKE THIS A STRONG PROPOSAL THAT WE CAN FEEL GOOD ABOUT. BUT THAT COMPOSITION OF THE BOARD IS A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE. NOTICE ANY THAT THEY'RE GOING TO LOOK. AT AND. HAVE THE EXPERTISE TO BE ABLE TO REALLY. YEAH VAMP COMMISSION THE CENTER. FOR ALL PROTECT TAXPAYER DOLLARS TO PROTECT THE GENERAL. IF YOU AND I. ABOUT THAT NIGHT. THERE'S REALLY. NO LEGAL. I'M NON LEGAL. FOR THE STATE THERE WERE WE'RE WE'RE NOT SURE EXACTLY WHAT EXTENT OF THAT'S SOME THAT ARE KEY- CHIEF FINANCIAL. MENTIONED CAN. BEYOND THAT I THINK THAT THERE'S POLITICAL AND MORAL. RAPE ME SET UP THIS ENTERPRISE AND IT'S AND IT FAILS AND THERE ARE CONSEQUENCES FOR LOWER INCOME COMMUNITIES. PEOPLE ARE GOING TO COME TO THE LEGISLATURE. THEY'RE GOING TO EXPECT THAT WE DO SOMETHING TO REDRESS SO I THINK WE NEED TO. THINK VERY CAREFULLY ABOUT HOW WE SET THIS UP IN A WAY THAT WORKS OKAY THIS IS A THIS IS AN IMPORTANT IDEA. IT'S A GOOD IDEA IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO CONSIDER AND THINK ABOUT IT THINK THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO HELP A LOT OF PEOPLE HERE. THAT NEED TO BE HELPED AND DESERVE FINANCIAL SERVICES AND ARE NOT GETTING THEM. MANY OF WHOM ARE BEING EXPLOITED IF YOU KNOW BEING SUBJECT EXPLOITATION RIGHT NOW. BUT WE'VE GOT TO DO THIS A REALLY THOUGHTFUL WE'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE WITH REAL EXPERTISE ARE RUNNING WITH THIS AND SO I APPRECIATE YOUR WILLINGNESS TO. CONTINUE TO WORK ON THOSE ISSUES. I'M GLAD THEY'RE GONNA BE OPPORTUNITY CAN YOU THAT CONVERSATION. AND I JUST. WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THAT CONVERSATION LAST NIGHT. THANK YOU SO REMEMBER- I. BELIEVE ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA CRISTINA GARCIA- YES THANK YOU AND I APOLOGIZE- I WAS TIED UP SO I'M PROBABLY GOING TO BE REPETITIVE SOME OF THE COMMENTS MY COLLEAGUES HAVE. ALREADY MADE- I LIVE IN THE CITY ABOVE ARDEN'S AND I KNOW I HAVE A NUMBER OF FOLKS ARE A UNSERVED- UNBANKED- IN MY COMMUNITY WHO ARE GOING TO THE CORNER LIQUOR STORE TO CASH THEIR CHECKS AND PAYING THOSE FEES- OREGON AT THE SUPERMARKET- ARE. AND THAT THAT MINIMUM WAGE TO EASE THE EASE TALK ABOUT YOU KNOW BEING DIMINISH TO AN EVEN LESSER AMOUNT OUT THERE- OUT THERE AND SO I THINK THIS DISCUSSION IS IMPORTANT BUT I DO HAVE A LOT OF HESITATION ABOUT. MANAGING EXPECTATIONS AND BEING REAL AND HONEST WITH MY CONVICTIONS ABOUT WHAT WE ARE DOING. OUT THERE AND BEING IN A RESPONSIBLE MANNER OUT THERE I THINK HAVING A MARKET STUDY OR FEASIBILITY STUDY. IS A GOOD THING AND BRINGING THAT BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE IS A GOOD THING. I HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE YOU KNOW BORDER BEFORE WE GET THOSE RESULTS. BACK OUT THERE. ARE YOU KNOW I HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT WE ARE DUPLICATING SERVICES THAT ARE OUT THERE IN TWO WEEKS SHOULD WE BE SHOWING THOSE UP. I HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT STARTING- PARTNERSHIP THAT MIGHT BE A pWE ALREADY HAVE. IS THERE A BETTER WAY TO DO THAT OUT THERE. ARE OUT THERE AND SO I HAVE. I HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT. ALSO THIRTY ANOTHER STATE AGENCY TO SERVE A COMMUNITY LIKE MINE ON WE HAVE THE AGENCIES THAT ARE NOT IN A GOOD JOB OF SERVING A COMMITTEE LIKE MINE. THANK THE TSC OF FOR EXAMPLE RIGHT AND SO WHAT AGAIN MANAGING THOSE EXPECTATIONS OF MY COMMUNITY AND SO I THINK THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT WE DEFINITELY NEED TO ADDRESS AND I DO APPRECIATE. THE AUTHOR ELEVATING THIS DISCUSSION THE SEEN OUR PLATFORM HERE. IT'S NOT A BILL THAT I COULD SUPPORT TODAY- AND I HOPE THAT AS THIS MOVE ON AND MAKE. CA AGAIN. THAT'S A OF THOSE CONCERNS THAT HAVE GET GET ADDRESSED- THANK YOU FOR TO. TAKE THAT THANK. THANK YOU FOR REMEMBER. AND OTHER ANY OTHER. BACK TO- BY STURGEON I JUST WANNA MAKE ONE FINAL COMMENT ON ONE OF THANK THE AUTHOR BECAUSE I KNOW THE AUTHOR HAS CHANGED HIS BILL SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE INCEPTION TO NOW. AND IT WAS YOUR DILIGENCE AND HARD TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN AND ALSO I WANT TO RECOGNIZE THE CHAIR IN HIS STAFF- FOR THE UNTOLD HOURS THAT YOU PUT INTO THIS FROM THE GROUPS THAT HE MET ON BOTH SIDES IN OPPOSITION OF ONE SUPPORTERS WILL BE OFFERING MEETING WITH ALL MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE- AS OUR NEW MOISTURE I WANT TO COMMEND YOU FOR ALL YOUR HARD WORK AND IT IS AN HONOR TO BE A MEMBER. OF YOUR COMMITTEE I AM BLASTERS ONE REITERATE I THINK IT'S SO IMPORTANT I COULD HAVE SAID IT BETTER THAN MY STEAM COLLEAGUES FROM THE FORTY FIFTH SIXTY SECOND AND SIXTY DISTRICT BETTER SPEAK MUCH BETTER THAN I COULD EVER HOPE FOR BUT THE IMPORTANCE OF. COMPRISING THE COMMITTEE OF EXPERTS FROM FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS SPECIFICALLY- IN THESE CREDIT UNIONS AND BANKS AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT CAN MAKE YOUR BILL MAKE THIS POLICY MORE SUCCESSFUL SO I. CERTAINLY HOPE THERE'S OPPORTUNITY FOR THAT. THANK YOU FOR. COMMENTS AND SEEING NO OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE. WE WILL GO BACK TO OFFER. SOME REMEMBER WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE YEAH I CAN'T SAY ENOUGH OTHER THAN I'M EXCITED ABOUT THE CONVERSATION AND THE ABILITY TO TALK TO EVERYBODY I MEAN AND I'M EXCITED ABOUT THE JOURNEY. I MEAN THIS IS A TESTAMENT TO THAT THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS WORKS WHERE PEOPLE CAN HONESTLY DEBATE- FOR ABOUT A MONTH AND A HALF- THE POLICY POINTS OR MAYBE EVEN TWO MONTHS. AND YOU COME TO A BETTER PRODUCT- SO I REALLY DO WANT TO. SAY IT AGAIN BECAUSE I'M NOT I'VE SAID IT TO EVERYBODY IN THE- TEXT EVERYBODY IN THE WORLD I COULD POSSIBLY THAT THE CHAIR DID A PHENOMENAL JOB. OF HELPING TO PUSH AND TO ASK THE TOUGH QUESTIONS. SO THAT WE HAVE SOMETHING- THAT AND THAT THAT IS BETTER AND SOUND PUBLIC POLICY BECAUSE- WE SHARE THE GOAL OF BANKING THE UNBANKED AND THOSE WHO ARE- UNDERBANKED. AND- FOR THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE IS OFTEN TIMES. FOLKS BOOK FOR THINGS. AS THEY GO THROUGH THE PROCESS. OF THE SAME VOTING BUT THIS PARTICULAR CASE- I FEEL GOOD ABOUT THE CONVERSATIONS WITH THOSE WHO ARE WHO MAY POTENTIALLY SUPPORT AND THOSE WHO. POTENTIALLY MAY NOT SUPPORT BECAUSE IT'S INFORMED US ON HOW TO MAKE A BETTER PRODUCT. BECAUSE WE ALL SHARE THE SAME GOAL OF BANKING AND THOSE WERE UNBANKED OR UNDERBANKED. BUT THE REALITY IS THAT THERE IS A EIGHT DESPERATE NEED FOR A PROGRAM LIKE THAT. FOR LIKE THIS IN AND MANY OF OUR COMMUNITIES. ALL UP AND DOWN THE STATE THAT LOOK LIKE THE ONE THAT I REPRESENT. AND WHEN WE DRIVE BY LIQUOR STORES WHEN WE DRIVE BY SMALL MOM AND POP SHOPS AND IT SAYS WILL CASH THE CHECK. THE CASHIER. THAT FIFTEEN DOLLARS AN HOUR IS NOT REALLY FIFTEEN DOLLARS AN HOUR WHEN IT'S WHEN IT'S TEN DOLLARS TO CASH A CHECK WHEN IT'S ANOTHER FIVE DOLLARS FOR MONEY ORDER WHEN IT'S- FEE HERE. OVERDRAFT FEE HERE A CHARGER A MINIMUM BALANCE THERE. OR A PAYDAY LENDER OR- OR ANY OTHER SORT OF- ANY OTHER SORT OF INSTITUTION. THAT THAT GALLAGHER THE DOLLAR AND- I'LL SAY THIS IS A- TOWARDS- THOSE POPULATIONS BUT- BUT BUT ALSO TEN ENSURING THAT WE KEEP MONEY IN PEOPLE'S POCKETS BECAUSE WE'RE TRYING TO DO- KEEP MONEY IN PEOPLE'S POCKETS.SO THAT HAVE THE ABILITY TO BID TO DEVELOP ALL TO HAVE A SAVINGS ACCOUNT. THE SUNDAY EARNED CREDIT TO NOT HAVE TO TAKE THE BUS AND ACTUALLY BUY A CAR. NOW TO SOME DAY MAYBE EVEN BUY A HOME. IT'S THOSE POPULATIONS WERE EARNING THE LEAST AMOUNT. OF HORROR UNDERBANKED. AND UNBANKED WHO WERE TRYING TO SERVE HERE SO I GOT A LOOK AT THE EXCITED ABOUT THE CONVERSATION MOVING FORWARD. AND WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR NEIGHBORHOOD. THANK YOU I DO WANT TO THANK EVERYONE FOR THEIR HARD WORK ON THIS BILL. AND TO HIGHLIGHT- THE CHIEF CONSULTANT AND THE COUNTLESS HOURS HE SAID HE IS POURED INTO THIS AND THE HARD WORK. AS YOU CAN TELL FROM THE DISCUSSION THE COMMITTEE HAS A LOT OF QUESTIONS AND CONCERNS. ABOUT WHAT IS BEING PROPOSED HERE TODAY. I'VE BEEN VERY CLEAR IN MY OWN STATEMENTS AND CONVERSATIONS THAT I AM DEEPLY CONCERNED. ABOUT HAVING THE STATE OPERATE- HAVING THE STATE OPERATING AS A BANK. OR A FINANCIAL SERVICES PLATFORM. THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT GOVERNMENT DOES REALLY WELL. AND THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT IT DOES NOT. WE SHOUD BE AWARE OF OUR LIMITS AND WE SHOULD EMBRACE POLICY SOLUTIONS. THAT BUILD OFF EXISTING SUCCESSFUL MODELS. I WORRY THIS BILL REQUIRES THE STATE TO TAKE ON A TASK. IT CANNOT POSSIBLY DELIVER ON. ONLY TO REPLICATE THE GOOD WORK BEING DONE BY COMMUNITY BANKS. CREDIT UNIONS AND NONPROFITS. I INSTRUCTED COMMITTEE STAFF. TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR AND SUPPORTERS TO FIGURE OUT A WAY FORWARD. FOR ME THE WAY FORWARD IS BETTER INFORMATION. CAMPUS PROGRAM WORK AND ACHIEVE ITS GOALS. AND WHAT ARE THE RISKS TO THE STATE AND TO THE PEOPLE PARTICIPATING AND OPENING ACCOUNTS. I AM SIMPLY NOT COMFORTABLE WITH MOVING FORWARD UNTIL WE HAVE ANSWERS. TO THESE QUESTIONS. THE COMMITTEE'S PROPOSED AMENDMENTS ALLOW ME TO RECOMMEND PASSAGE TODAY. THOSE AMENDMENTS ARE DETAILED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. ONE AMENDMENT IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT TO TODAY'S DISCUSSION. IT WILL REQUIRE THE BOARD TO CONTRACT OR CONTRACT OUT FOR A MARKET FEASIBILITY STUDY. OF THE BANK CAL PROGRAM. THE FEASIBILITY STUDY MUST LOOK AT THESE QUESTIONS. ABOUT IMPLEMENTATION AND COST. AND THE LEGISLATURE MUST APPROVE THE BOARD'S DETERMINATION. THAT THE PROGRAM CAN WORK. ONLY UP ON THAT APPROVAL CAN WE ALLOW FOR STATE DOLLARS TO BE SPENT. ON THE PROGRAM. THIS AMENDMENT IS CRITICAL. IT GIVES ME COMFORT KNOWING WE ARE DOING OUR DUE DILIGENCE. AND UPPER LEVEL. WILL REVISIT THE PROPOSAL ONCE AGAIN. WHAT'S WE HAVE BETTER INFORMATION. AND FINALLY I ASK THAT YOU TAKE SERIOUSLY THE CONCERNS ADDRESSED BY MY FELLOW COMMITTEE MEMBERS TODAY. THE MESSAGE WAS LOUD AND CLEAR. FROM THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS BOARD COMPOSITION. HOW THAT- COMPOSITION COMES TOGETHER AND INCLUDES THOSE FROM THE INDUSTRY. THE STUDY CONTENT FOR THOROUGH ANALYSIS AND ALTERNATIVES NOT JUST TO GIVE A MESSAGE OF. OF THIS IMPROPER UP BUT TO ACTUALLY PROVIDE VIABLE ALTERNATIVES IF THERE ARE BETTER WAYS TO DO SOMETHING. SO WITH THAT I DO AGREE WITH MY FELLOW MEMBERS COMMENTS AND I RESERVE THE RIGHT TO CALL IT BACK TO COMMITTEE IF THIS BILL MOVES IN THE WRONG DIRECTION. WITH THAT DO I HAVE A MOTION. SO I HAVE A MOTION FROM ASSEMBLYMEMBER STONES SECOND FROM ASSEMBLYMEMBER WICKS.
