AND DO NOT WANT TO RUSH THIS PROCESS SO WE DO HAVE AN OPTION AS IT WILL BE RELATIVELY QUICK SESSION COMPARED TO WHAT WE'VE SEEN EARLIER IN THE WEEK WE HAVE ONE BILL IN FRONT OF US THAT'S AB FOURTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN BEFORE WE GET STARTED ON THIS I WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO SAY. HOW GRATEFUL I AM I KNOW THAT SENATOR WINNER IS ON BEHALF OF AS IN NUMBER TWO. THE NUMBER TWO HAS. BEEN WORKING ON THIS ISSUE. DILIGENTLY FOR MANY MONTHS NOW. THERE IS BEEN A FORMAL AD HOC PROCESS THAT WERE IT WAS ESTABLISHED TO BE ABLE TO NEGOTIATE AND GO BACK AND FORTH WITH THIS AND NUMBER TWO ON AMENDMENTS HE IS STUCK TO THAT GAME PLAN 1100% OF THE TIME THROUGH THICK AND THIN IN WHEN TIMES. WERE LOW HE CONTINUED TO GO HI AND I JUST WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO SAY HOW GRATEFUL WE ARE TO THE LEADERSHIP OF THE SENATE VIRTUE ON THIS IMPORTANT BILL HE'S BEEN COLLABORATIVE HE'S BEEN TRANSPARENT IN HE'S BEEN ABLE TO FIND THE GET THIS IN FRONT OF US WITH STAKEHOLDER INPUT PUBLIC MEETINGS AS WELL AS TO THE AD HOC PROCESS. ALSO ONE TAKE A MOMENT TO SAY THANK YOU SO MUCH TO THE CHAIR OF HOUSING HERE IN THE SENATE SIDE CENTER WIENER BUT FOR ALL OF HIS COLLABORATION AND BETWEEN HIS PERSPECTIVE TO THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE IN THIS WOULD NOT HAPPEN WITHOUT EITHER THEM THE TWO GOOD MEMBERS UP FROM CITY AND COUNTY SAN FRANCISCO AND OF COURSE WE HAVE NO THE GOOD NUMBER ASSEMBLY MEMBER TEAM AS WELL. BUT WITHOUT FURTHER DO ONLY TURNED OVER THE CHAIR OF THE ASSEMBLY HOUSING TO BE OUR PRESENT AB FOURTEEN A SEVEN AND AGAIN THANK YOU SIR FOR ALL OF YOUR WORK. THANK YOU ELIMINATE LET ME ALSO START BY BY FIRST THING IN THE COMMITTEE FOR GIVING ME AN OPPORTUNITY TO REAP PERCENT THIS BILL AND OF COURSE TO THANK THE CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE WHO SPENT MANY MANY HOURS NOT JUST WITH OUR OFFICE BUT WITH STAKEHOLDERS AROUND THE BAY IN YOUR DISTRICT IN IN WORKING THIS THROUGH AND WORKING THROUGH ALL THE ISSUES ALSO WANNA JUST LIKE YOUR STAFF WHO HAS DONE INCREDIBLE WORK WORKING WITH OUR TEAM AND THE REST OF THE BAY ON THIS. AND I KNOW CENTER WINNER WAS HERE BUT THANKS TO CENTER WIENER AND HIS TEAM FOR MOVING THIS FORWARD SO SENATORS THIS BILL AS A REFRESHER IS A REGIONAL BILL TO ADDRESS A HOUSING CRISIS IN OUR BAY AREA. THE INTENT THE BILL HAS BEEN TO ENABLE THE BAY AREA TO HELP OURSELVES TO GIVE THE NINE COUNTY REGION THE AUTHORITY TO RAISE FUNDING. FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. SIMILAR TO HOW THE REGION. HAS HAD LEGISLATIVE AUTHORITY TO RAISE MONIES FOR TRANSPORTATION THANKS TO CENTER BILL. AS WELL AS FOR RESTORATION OF THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY. OUR HOPE HAS BEEN THROUGH THIS PROCESS THAT THIS AUTHORITY WILL HELP TO ADDRESS THE HOUSING PRICES IN THE BAY AREA. WHERE WE HAVE CONTINUE TO SUFFER FROM RECORD HOME PRICES RENTS EVICTIONS AND HOMELESSNESS LEVELS. WHEN WE WERE LAST IN THIS COMMITTEE IN EARLY JULY THE REGIONAL AGENCIES WERE IN THE MIDST OF CONTEMPLATING RECOMMENDED AMENDMENTS TO THIS BILL THAT WOULD CONVEY THE SUPPORT OF A BROAD RANGE OF CITIES AND COUNTIES IN THE BAY AREA. AND I AM GRATEFUL THAT WE HAVE THAT TO DAY. WE HAD AT THE REQUEST OF YOUR CHAIR. ESSENTIALLY PAUSE THE BILL UNTIL WE RECEIVE THAT FEEDBACK. THE REGIONAL AGENCIES HAVE CONCLUDED THEIR PROCESS IN JULY THEY VOTED TO SUPPORT THIS BILL WITH THEIR AMENDMENTS BY VOTE OF TWENTY THREE TO THREE AT THE ASSOCIATION OF BAY AREA GOVERNMENTS. BY A VOTE OF THIRTEEN A THREE AT THE METROPOLITAN COMMISSION TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION. WE HAVE SINCE INCORPORATED THEIR PROPOSED AMENDMENTS AND WORK CLOSELY WITH YOUR CHAIR. TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS THAT HE HAD REYES WITH THIS BILL AND THE BILL IN FRONT OF YOU REFLECTS ALL OF THOSE CHANGES. SOME OF THE HIGH LEVELS IN TERMS OF GOVERNANCE WE'RE NOT ESTABLISHING A NEW REGIONAL AGENCY OR BUREAUCRACY WHICH WAS WHAT WAS INITIALLY PROPOSED IN THIS BILL MANY MANY MONTHS AGO IN ITS FIRST. PRODUCTION INSTEAD ALL MAJOR DECISIONS RELATED TO THIS BILL RELATED TO REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE. WILL BE MADE BY A BAG AND THE M. T. C. WITH A BAG. ACTING AS THE LEAD AGENCY. IN TERMS OF REVENUE THE SHARE FUNDS WILL BE DISTRIBUTED DIRECTLY TO COUNTIES. WITH A SHARE. THAT HAS BEEN INCREASED FROM 75% TO AT LEAST EIGHTY PERCENT. REFLECTING A DESIRE FOR HIGHER RETURN TO SOURCE. WITH REMAINING 20% TO GO BACK TO THE REGIONAL POOL WITH THE EXCEPTION BEING A POTENTIAL. TAX ON EMPLOYMENT WHERE 50% WOULD GO BACK TO THE REGIONAL POOL WHICH ENABLES OUR REGION TO SUPPORT CITIES THAT FACE THE BIRD OF HOUSING. THE WORK FORCE THAT WE HAVE. IN ADDITION THE THREE LARGEST CITIES IN THE REGION WOULD GET AN ALLOCATION OF FUNDS FROM THEIR COUNTIES REFLECTING THEIR DISPROPORTIONATE SHARE BURDEN TO BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND OTHER CITIES IN THE REGION WOULD ALSO GET A GUARANTEED FUNDING IF THEY HAVE MORE THAN ALLOCATION. IN TERMS OF EXPENDITURE WE HAVE AGREED THREE MTC NAY BAGS AT LEAST. TWO THIRDS OF THE FUNDING WOULD BE DEDICATED TO PRODUCTION AND PRESERVATION OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND AGAIN THANKS TO THE CHAIR FOR HIS. INPUT ON THAT. AND ADDITIONAL MONIES WOULD BE ALSO ABLE TO BE SPENT ON TENOR PROTECTIONS INFRASTRUCTURE THAT SUPPORTS HOUSING. AS WELL STAFF SUPPORT. WE'RE EXCITED ABOUT ALL THESE CHANGES TO THE BILL WE'RE EXCITED ABOUT THE REGION WIDE COLLABORATION AND WE OF COURSE ARE COMMITTED TO CONTINUING THE WORK. ON THIS WITH THE REGION IN THE COMING YEAR SO WITH THAT LIKE TO TURN OVER TO OUR WITNESS. MS LONG FROM THE MTC. GOOD MORNING MA'AM YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES IS GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN WE APPRECIATE YOU MAKING THE TREK. SACRAMENTO GAME MY PLEASURE. OF REBEKAH LONG MANAGER OF GOVERNMENT RELATIONS WITH HIM TO SEE AN EIGHT. GOOD MORNING CHAIR MCGUIRE IF I SHARE MORE LIKE IN MEMBERS. WE'RE VERY HAPPY TO BE DAY WITH A SUPPORT POSITION ON A. B. FOURTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN THIS HAS BEEN A REMARKABLY. COLLABORATIVE PROCESS WERE VERY GRATEFUL TO THE AUTHORS AND THE NUMBER TWO AND HIS STAFF. ON TV TO YOU PERSONALLY MISTER CHAIR AND YOUR STAFF. ON TO BRING US HERE TODAY ON THIS BILL. REALLY HAS BEEN WELL OUTLINED BY THE AUTHOR SO I WON'T GO THROUGH ALL OF THAT THEY'RE REALLY JUST TO SAY HOW CRITICAL IT IS THAT WE HAVE NOT JUST. ADDITIONAL TOOLS IN TERMS OF ON. INCREASED INCENTIVES TO BUILD HOUSING BUT MORE RESOURCES NOW WE KNOW THAT WE CAN'T SOLVE OUR HOUSING CRISIS SIMPLY WITH. YOU KNOW EFFORTS TO STREAMLINE PRODUCTION FROM THE MARKET RATE. ALL WE DO HAVE AN ENORMOUS NEED TO BUILD MORE. AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND THAT DOES REQUIRE PUBLIC SUBSIDY. I'M SO WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS IT DOESN'T ASK FOR ON THE STATE TO RAISE TAXES. IT PROVIDES A NEW TOOL TO REGIONAL AGENCIES TO PUT MEASURES ON THE BALLOT. ON THAT WOULD BE SUBJECT TO A TWO THIRDS VOTE. ON AND ALSO SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE COLLABORATION AND DISCUSSION AT THE REGIONAL LEVEL SO NONE OF THESE TAXES COULD MOVE FORWARD WITHOUT APPROVAL OF BOTH BOARDS. ON AND SO THAT'S AN EXTENSIVE DEGREE OF LOCAL ENGAGEMENT THAT WOULD BE REQUIRED SO WITH THAT IN JUST A HERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AND ASK YOUR AYE VOTE AND- WITH MUCH GRATITUDE FOR ALL THE WORK TO BRING US HERE TODAY. THANK YOU SO MUCH WHEN WE OPEN IT UP FOR THOSE WHO MAY BE IN SUPPORT. IF YOU COULD PLEASE ADVANCE THIS TIME LOOKING FOR THOSE IN SUPPORT THE BILL. GOOD MORNING MEMBERS HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CITY OF FREMONT. SAN LEANDRO OAKLAND AND BERKELEY THAT'S THE LEGACY OF CRANKS THANK THANK YOU SO MUCH GOOD MORNING. RUNNING HOLLY FOR MANY TO HIS SERVICE PROVIDERS PUBLIC AFFAIRS ON BEHALF OF NPH HABITAT FOR AMENITIES BASIL CONNELLY. SB AT HOME AND CALIFORNIA CAN BE. THANK YOU SO MUCH GOOD MORNING. JULIE CENTER ON BEHALF OF ENTERPRISE COMMUNITY PARTNERS A CO SPONSOR THANK YOU THANK YOU. FOR ANY LAST CALL FOR THOSE WHO ARE IN SUPPORT. WE'RE NOT GONNA ASK THOSE WHO MAY BE IN OPPOSED IF YOU COULD PLEASE ADVANCE THIS TIME. MORNING SURE MEMBERS IN TWENTY. CDI A FIRST ONE I THINK THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHURCH YOU MIGHT JUST BRING THE MIKE UP CLOSER I'M SORRY AS ONE MAKE SURE WE GET WORDS I APOLOGIZE FOR INTERRUPTING FORCE OR MYSELF BUT I. CAN HEAR YEAH YOU'RE GOOD. SO I JUST INJURED BECAUSE IT OUR CVA FIRST WE WANT TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHIU AND ALL THE STAFF WORKING WITH US AND GRACIOUS. GRACIOUSLY GIVING US THEIR LIMITED TIME SINCE THE NEWS AMENDMENTS WENT TO PRINT LAST WEEK. WE REALLY APPRECIATE THAT THE ASSEMBLYMEMBERS TAKEN THE TIME TO HEAR OUR CONCERNS. AND TO CONSIDER POSSIBLE REMEDIES. UNFORTUNATELY THERE'S A LOOPHOLE OR HOUSING CAN BE TAXED IN THE BAY AREA WHICH- CAN ULTIMATELY HAVE AN IMPACT ON OUR FOLKS FOR THESE REASONS WE ARE. SEE I AS AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH APPRECIATE BEING HERE GOOD MORNING SIR. GOOD MORNING CASEY ELITE ON BEHALF OF THOSE TOWNS OF LAFAYETTE. PLEASANTON IN DANVILLE WERE IN OPPOSITION. OUR PRIMARY OPPOSITION STEMS FROM THE RETURN TO SOURCE ON THE FUNDING. AS IS CURRENTLY IN THE BILL THE FUNDS WOULD RETURN. TO THE COUNTY OF ORIGIN. A WE BELIEVE IT WOULD BE MORE APPROPRIATE FOR SOME OF A PORTION OF THOSE FUNDS TO RETURN DIRECTLY TO THE CITIES OF ORIGIN. SO THAT WAY THE PROPERTY TAX OWNERS THE BUSINESSES THAT ARE PAYING THESE TAXES CAN HAVE SOME LEVEL OF ASSURANCE. THAT THEY WILL BE RECEIVING FUNDS BACK. THEREFORE THEY CAN GAUGE IN SOME LONG TERM PLANNING THOSE TYPES OF THINGS. THANK YOU NO THANK YOU SO MUCH. WOULD LIKE TO GO TO DO A LAST CALL FOR THOSE WHO MAY BE. OPPOSED IF YOU COULD PLEASE COMPORT LAST CALL FOR POST. LIKE TO BE TO BRING IT BACK WOULD JUST LIKE TO JUST QUICKLY IN A TURN OVER THE COMMITTEE. ON THE ISSUE RETURN TO SOURCE THIS WAS A- A REALLY BIG DISCUSSION FOR. A FEW WEEKS DURING THE NEGOTIATIONS ON THIS I THINK THAT WE ARE ABLE TO STRIKE A BALANCE. WE'RE ABLE TO KEEP THE LARGEST CITIES IN THE BAY AREA. SAN JOSE OAKLAND AND SAN FRANCISCO. CONTINUE TO SEE MONEY FLOW DIRECTLY BACK. BUT WE ALSO HEARD FROM SOME SMALL CITIES THAT SAID THAT. THEY MAY NOT BE ABLE TO HANDLE THE DOLLARS. THAT MAY BE FLOWING BACK. AND CANDIDLY. I THOUGHT WE NEEDED TO BE A TO DO MORE. SO WE TOOK A DATA DRIVEN APPROACH WHEN IT COMES TO THE ISSUE OF RETURN TO SOURCE. IN WHAT WE. ENDED UP SAYING IS IF THERE IS ANY CITY THAT HAS OVER HOUSING STOCK. WITHIN THEIR COUNTY THEY WOULD GET DIRECT RETURN TO SOURCE SO THAT WOULD MEAN LIKE FOR EXAMPLE SANTA ROSA WHO IS 54% OF ALL AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THE COUNTY CINEMA WOULD ALSO BE ELIGIBLE. THAT WOULD MEAN NAPA WHAT HAS 53% OF ALL FOR MY HOUSE IN THE COUNTY WOULD GET THAT DIRECT. BUT THE COUNTY WOULD WORK COLLABORATIVELY WITH THOSE SMALLER CITIES THAT WAS A BIG ISSUE WHICH I THINK THAT WE ARE ABLE TO WORK THROUGH OBVIOUSLY THEY'RE GOING TO BE SOME. WHO WILL STILL HAVE SOME CONCERNS IN THE OTHER ITEM I WILL IN NO OPENING UP IS I WILL NOT GO THROUGH. AS I DID AT HOUSING IN AGAIN I WANNA SING GREAT RESPECT TO ARE THE ADVOCATES WHO ARE HERE ON BEHALF OF CIA I WOULD TO SHARE MY FRUSTRATION I PROMISE YOU I WILL NOT GO INTO WHAT I SAID AT HOUSING. IS THAT THIS WAS VERY LAST MINUTE AND DO BELIEVE THAT THOSE CONCERNS CAN BE WORED OUT AT A LOCAL LEVEL AS THIS INITIATIVE THAT WERE IT THAT'S IN FRONT OF US TODAY. IT'S SIMPLY PROVIDING. PERMISSION TO BE ABLE TO ADVANCE. ANY POTENTIAL REVENUE MEASURE. REVENUE MEASURE WOULD NEED TO BE PUT ON TO THE BALLOT BY A BAG IN MTC. PRIOR TO ANY OF THE REVENUE MEASURES GOING IN FRONT OF THE BAY AREA VOTERS THEY WOULD NEED TO BE DEBATED AND DISCUSSED PUBLICLY AND ULTIMATELY WHAT ENDS UP IN THOSE MEASURES WILL BE TO THE REPRESENTATIVES OF A BAG IN IN DC. SO LONG STORY SHORT. THOSE CONCERNS CAN STILL BE ADDRESSED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL PRIOR TO A POTENTIAL MEASURE BEING PUT ON TO THE BALLOT. I'M GONNA STOP YAPPING AND TURN IT OVER I TO ANY MEMBERS WHO WOULD LIKE ME TO SPEAK IN ALSO WELCOME MOTION IN BEFORE CENTER BELL SPEAKS I JUST WANT TO SAY. THERE'S BEEN A BIGGER CHAMPION OF FOR MY HOUSE AND THEN SENATE ABOUT THANK YOU. FOR ALL YOUR WORK SIR. OKAY ONE OF THE ONE OF THE QUESTIONS I HAD WITH THE REVISED BILL. WAS WHAT IS THE CAN YOU DESCRIBE THE PUBLIC PROCESS. THAT HAPPENS BEFORE THE BALLOT MEASURE. AND THEN THE PUBLIC PROCESS ONCE THE BALLOT MEASURES APPROVED AFTER THE BALLOT MEASURE. COULD. YOU CAN YOU GO OVER THAT FOR ME LIKE SO OR AND THEN AFTER SEARCHES AND A VERY QUICK LEVEL THAT SORT OF HIGH LEVEL AS YOUR CHAIR HAD HIGHLIGHTED THERE ARE TWO MAJOR REGIONAL BODIES IN THE BAY AREA WHICH SIR BILL KNOWS WELL. A BAG AND THE EMPTY SEAT AND IN ORDER FOR THIS TO BE APPROVED A BIG WOULD START THE PROCESS OF PROPOSING POTENTIAL REVENUE MEASURES AND DETAILS OF AN EXPENDITURE PLAN IT WOULD HAVE TO BE APPROVED BY A BACK THAT THEN WOULD GO TO THE MTC THAT YOU SERVED ON FOR SIMILAR APPROVAL IF THE MTC. DECIDES THAT THEY WANT CHANGES TO THAT IT WOULD HAVE TO THEN GO BACK TO THE A BACK FOR FINAL APPROVAL BEFORE IT WOULD GO TO VOTERS FOR TWO THIRDS VOTE AND SO ISRAEL NO TWO THIRDS VOTES AT THE BALLOT BOX ARE DIFFICULT. I AND WOULD REQUIRE COULD SIGNIFICANT CONSENSUS WE ALSO KNOW THAT HAMMER NOT CONSENSUS A BACK AN MTC OR ALSO DIFFICULT SO THAT'S AT A HIGH LEVEL THE PROCESS. WHEN YOU SEE A BAG WHICH BODY OF A BAG OR YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE EXACT APART OKAY THAT'S WHAT I WANTED TO FIND OUT YES OKAY SO THEN ONCE. THE TWO BODIES. AGREE UPON. THAT IT GOES ON THE BALLOT AS DESCRIBED BY THE TWO BODIES. THEN THE VOTERS APPROVE IT THEN IN TERMS OF THE ON GOING. KIND OF ALLOCATION THE PLAN AND SO FORTH WHAT IS THE PUBLIC PROCESS OF OUR HOUSE THAT PROCEDURALLY GO WE WELL FIRST OF ALL WE OUTLINED SEVERAL OF THE DETAILS OF WHAT THEY NEED TO LOOK LIKE SO FOR EXAMPLE AT THE SUGGESTION OF CENTER MCGUIRE TWO THIRDS THAT MONEY HAVE TO GO TO PRODUCTION OF PRESERVATION. OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. EXCUSE ME. THE MONEY'S AWARD YOU HEARD THIS DISCUSSION AROUND MONIES THAT WOULD BE GOING TO COUNTIES VERSUS MONIES THAT WOULD BE GOING TO A REGIONAL POT. THAT ALL GETS THAT'LL AT SOME OF THE HIGHER POINTS OF THAT HAVE BEEN SET BY THIS BILL SO. OUT FOR MANY THE REVENUE SOURCES 80% OF THE MONIES WOULD BE RETURNED TO SOURCE WOULD GO TO THE COUNTIES WHERE THEY CAME FROM. 20% WOULD GO TO A REGIONAL POT WITH THE EXCEPTION OF ONE REVENUE SOURCE WHICH WOULD BE A BUSINESS RELATED SOURCE IN THE IDEAS WHERE THOSE JOBS ARE CREATED. HALF OF THAT MONEY SHOULD GO TO REGIONAL POT TO ADDRESSES CONCERNS IS THAT IS THAT YOUR QUESTION. PROCESS THAT YOU GO THROUGH OKAY THE BALLOT MEASURES APPROVED OKAY WE GOT ALL THE STUFF IN THE LAW APPROVED IT THE YOU HAVE THE AYE THOSE STATUTES JEFF TO OBSERVE THEN YOU HAVE A BODY THAT ALLOCATES THE MONEY TO CITIES COUNTIES HE'S FROM UP AND WANT TO HUNDRED DO. THEY GO AND MAKE. US FOR AYE AYES AND. HOW IS THE SO YOU HAVE AN OVERALL OF STRATEGIC PLAN SO COUNTIES WOULD DETERMINE RING ON THIS JACK COUNTIES WOULD DETERMINE AN EXPENDITURE PLAN. AND THAT WOULD GO THROUGH THE PUBLIC PROCESS SO SANTA CLARA COUNTY. SAN FRANCISCO COUNTY EXCEPT FOR A WOOD FIGURE OUT THE POT OF MONEY THAT COMES IN. AND HAVE THAT DISCUSSION OBVIOUSLY WITH THEIR CITIES UP FOR THAT PART OF MONEY. OKAY THEY WOULD HAVE TO HAVE A PUBLIC HEARING EACH COUNTERACT ABSOLUTELY THEY HAVE TO GO TAKE THAT PLAN WHATEVER THE AGREE ON AND GET THE. THE ORIGINAL BODY TO APPROVE THE PLAN AFTER THE AGREED TO IT. I WAS AT WORK. YEAH I THINK THAT EXPENDITURE PLAN WOULD SIMPLY HAVE TO BE CONFIRMED THAT IT'S COMPLETED BUT IT'S WITH REGARD TO THE DISCRETION OF THE COUNTY. OKAY SO THAT WAS SOMETHING. MAYBE THEY WANT TO DO SOMETHING A CERTAIN WAY THEY CAN DO IT WITHOUT HAVING DOT OVER WRITTEN BY THE REGIONAL BODY THAT'S RIGHT THEY WOULD HAVE TO COMPLY WITH THE TERMS OF THIS BILL BUT YES. OKAY YEAH. AND OKAY SO THE COUNTY WOULD HAVE THE SPECIFIC. ALLOCATION YOU KNOW LIKE IF THERE IS. TWENTY TWO CITIES. AND THEY WANTED TO ALLOCATED TO ALL TWENTY TWO CITIES THANKS TO THAT OUT OR THEY CAN ALLOCATED TO PROJECTS OR COULD THEY ARE THEY ALLOCATED TO PROJECTS OR TO COMMUNITIES. THERE ARE LIKE IS THERE LIKE ASSEMBLY COMES AT AN ONCE. ROGER TO APPROVED DO THEY ALLOCATED TO THAT ORDER THE ALLOCATED TO THE CITIES AND THEN THE CITY'S ALLOCATED TO THE PROJECTS. ALL THIS CAR. IT'S ACTUALLY AS IT'S AS THE COUNTY SEE FIT OF THEIR PROJECTS THAT WOULD BE LIKELY BROUGHT FORWARD BY CITIES BUT GENERALLY WOULD BE EITHER PROJECTS OR CITIES OKAY. AND. MESSAGE QUESTIONS GET A CLEARER SO IF THE COUNTY WATER TO ALLOCATED TO A HOUSING TRUST DIRECTLY TO THE ALLOCATED TO HOUSING TRUST. IF THEY WANTED TO DO THAT IS THAT ALLOWED UNDER THE I BELIEVE THAT IS I JUST WANT TO CONFIRM MY STAFF IS CONFIRMING THAT YES THERE'S A LOT OF CASES ARE COUNTY WOULD PROBABLY JUST OUT. YOU KNOW THE SMALLER CITIES. THE WOULD PREFER. TO NOT BE IN CHARGE OF MANAGING THE MONEY AND DOING ALL THE PROCESS THEY DID TURN IT OVER TO THE- ON A HOUSING TRUST. THEN THE COUNTY HOUSING TRUST WOULD BE MORE EFFICIENT. ALLOCATED TO AND REVIEW THE PROJECTS AND THEN ALLOCATE THE MONEY TO THOSE AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHY ACER REQUIRE AND I HAD HAD HAD THOUGHT THAT THE FORMULA MADE SENSE FOR THE SOME OF THE LARGEST CITIES TO RECEIVE A DIRECT ALLOCATION BUT OTHERWISE TO GIVE THE COUNTIES THE DISCRETION TO FIGURE OUT THE MOST EFFICIENT WAY. TO GET IT TO THE PROJECTS THAT WOULD BEST HELP BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE MANY CITIES AS YOU PUT IT THAT DON'T HAVE THE EXPERTISE I DON'T HAVE HOUSING DEPARTMENT THE WHERE WITH ALL OR THE INTEREST TO DO IT AND YET THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING NEEDS STILL EXIST. OKAY OKAY THAT'S GOOD I ANSWERED THE AS ALL MY QUESTIONS THAT I HEARD OUT OF MY COMMUNITY AND THANK YOU FIRST BILL AND I MOVED THROUGH THE BILL. FOR THANK YOU SO MUCH CENTER BELL THE MEMBERS ANY GONNA DO A QUICK ON QUICK TIME CHECK WE HAVE CENTER TARA CENTER NIELSEN WHO'D LIKE THAT COMMENT WOULD ALSO LIKE TO BE A HAD TO. CHAIR HOUSES IN A WINNER IF YOU'D LIKE TO BE A COMMON AS WELL ON THIS SO WE ARE. GOING TO NEED TO RECESS. AT APPROXIMATELY NINE AM. BE ABLE TO GET TO THE FLOOR. SO I JUST WANNA BE WHERE AN THAT TURN OVER CENTER OR TITLE THEN WE'RE GONNA GO TO SENATOR NIELSEN. QUICK QUESTION AND THEN FOLLOWED BY STATEMENT. THE BILL IS JUST PACIFIC TO THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA WHICH MEANS THAT COUNTIES OF ALAMEDA CONTRA COSTA MARIN NAPA THE NINE COUNTY REGIONS OF THE BAY CORRECT YOU KNOW ASSEMBLY MEMBER TO AYE. YOU PROBABLY KNOW THIS BY NOW I'M NOT A BIG FAN OF INCREASING TAXES OR FEES BUT I REALLY DO ADMIRE YOU KNOW YOUR HARD WORK AND TRYING TO. YOU KNOW AFTER FOR HOUSING FOR YOUR FOR YOUR DISTRICT IN YOUR REGION AND SO. FOR THOSE REASONS TODAY I WILL BE SUPPORTING YOUR YOUR YOUR BILL SO. JUST WANTED TO. IT JUST WANTED TO ASK IN AND PUT AND LET YOU KNOW THAT AS WELL. THANK YOU SO MUCH CENTER TARA. MORNING CENTER NIELSEN UPGRADE AND I HAD A FOOTHOLD IN THIS AREA MANY YEARS AGO IN FACT WAS EVEN A MEMBER OF THE CDC KNOWS THE CDC STILL ALIVE AND WELL I SERVED ON THE CDC. AFTER YOU DID SO YES IT IS WELL HERE'S THE ISSUE. I DON'T. THINK THERE'S ANYTHING IN THIS LEGISLATION THAT WOULD HELP. EXPEDITE OR RELIEVE SOME OF THE COST ADD ONS THAT HAVE BEEN A MAJOR CONTRIBUTING FACTOR LIKE TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS SO. AND SAID THIS IS GOING TO BE TOUTED AS A MODEL FOR ALL OF CALIFORNIA IT'S GOING TO BE PRETTY TOUGH FOR ME TO VOTE FOR SOMETHING LIKE THAT IS THERE ANYTHING IN HERE THAT WILL FAST TRACK CONSTRUCTION. TO GET SOME OF THE THINGS THAT CONCERN THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY OUT OF THE WAY OR RELIEVE THEIR BURDENS AND THE IMPEDIMENTS IN THE LITIGATION. CENTER WINNER AS A BILL HE'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT. PLEASE A SIMILAR TO SO THIS OF THIS BILL IS ABOUT AFFORDABLE HOUSING FUNNY THERE IS A PORTION OF POTENTIAL EXPENDITURES THAT WOULD PROVIDE CITIES WITH ESSENTIALLY TECH THE 10% OF THE POOL COULD BE USED FOR INCENTIVES TO CITIES. THAT ARE DOING A BETTER JOB OF BUILDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING SO BROADLY SPEAKING YOU KNOW THE IDEAS THAT COUNTIES WOULD BE MAKING DECISIONS ON WHERE TO BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING WITHIN THEIR- WITHIN THEIR REGION AND- WOULD ALSO BE AND- THEY WOULD BEAT IN CENTER TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WHAT. WHAT WOULD COLUSA FOR THE HOUSING PRODUCTION WITHIN WITHIN THOSE REGIONS BUT I WILL SEND A DIFFERENT FRONT ON THOSE ON THOSE TOPICS I THINK WE SHARE THE SAME POLICY GOALS I'VE BEEN VERY SUPPORTIVE OF. MOVING FOR A CONVERSATION AS A CHAIR OF THE ASSEMBLY HOUSING COMMITTEE ON WHAT TO DO AROUND IMPACT FEES AS WELL AS HOW DO WE STREAMLINED HOUSING WE KNOW. THAT A SIGNIFICANT HOUSING PRODUCTION IS THE ONLY LONG TERM SOLUTION I HAD HOPED THAT WE WERE GOING TO SEE CENTER WINNERS BILL COPPER TORE HOUSE I HOPE THAT THERE WILL BE. SIGNIFICANT PRODUCTION BILLS MOVING FORWARD THAT WE CAN TIE TO THIS SO WE CERTAINLY SHARE THOSE POLICY GOALS. I THANK OF. SALMON TO ANAHEIM WHERE. FOR STATE. TODAY I AM NOT REPORTER. THANK YOU SO MUCH TENDERNESS IN VERY GRATEFUL THANK YOU VERY TURN OVER TO CENTER WINNER PLAYERS QUICKLY SO WE CAN GET TO THE FLOOR I WANT TO THANK MY ASSEMBLY MEMBER. HE HE ALWAYS SMILES AND REYES. IF I IF I FIXES BOTTLES AND HE FIXES MINE ON HIS SENATOR SO. FOR HIS LEADERSHIP THIS IS BEEN A REALLY HARD BILL I'M OR ONE ONE WHEN WAS FIRST PROPOSED THERE'S A LOT OF SKEPTICISM. ABOUT IT BUT THE AUTHOR HAS REALLY ASSIST AND I'M PROUD TO BE A CO AUTHOR OF THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT ALL THIS DOES. IS SAYS TO THE BAY AREA THAT IF THE VOTERS OF THE BAY AREA WANT TO GO BY A TWO THIRDS VOTE. THE FUNDS AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR LOWER INCOME RESIDENTS IN THE VOTERS OF THE BAY AREA SHOULD BE ABLE WITH A TWO THIRDS VOTE. ODD TO DO THAT AND I THINK. THAT REGIONAL AUTONOMY TO. MEET A REALLY DEEP CREDIT BECAUSE THE CRISIS EVERYWHERE IN CALIFORNIA BUT THE BAY AREA. IS A SPECIAL KIND OF CRISIS IT'S REALLY BAD. SHE FOR LOWER INCOME RESIDENTS WERE BEING PUSHED IN THE HOMELESSNESS. AND HI. IN TERMS THE COST OF THE QUESTION FROM THE US FROM I CENTER NIELSEN. ON RIGHT NOW IN CALIFORNIA UNDER SB THIRTY FIVE WHICH I AUTHORED TWO YEARS AGO. ESSENTIALLY A 100% AFFORDABLE HOUSING. REALLY ANYTHING THAT'S AT LEAST 50% AFFORDABLE. IS STREAMLINED. ESSENTIALLY IN ALL OF CALIFORNIA WITH ONLY MINOR EXCEPTIONS NO SEQUEL NO DISCRETIONARY PERMITTING. NODE LAWSUITS AROUND SEE WHAT. IT'S ALL TAKEN OUT OF THAT STREAMLINED. AND THEN THE AUTHOR ACTUALLY SOMEONE OR TO AUTHORED LEGISLATION SPECIFIC TO SUPPORT OF HOUSING FOR FORMALLY HOMELESS PEOPLE. SO WE HAVE MASSIVELY STREAMLINED THE HOUSING THAT WOULD BE FUNDED BY THIS MEASURE SO JUST TO POINT THAT OUT. SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I'M A STRONG SUPPORTER OF THIS BILL. THANK YOU SO MUCH AND WE'RE GONNA GO TO THE VICE CHAIR MS RUSH. THE COMMISSION SURE THIS IS THE FOURTH HEARING WE'VE HAD ON THIS BILL. SO I JUST WANNA LET YOU KNOW THAT I'M TRYING TO CATCH THE VISION AND MY ISSUE IS THAT I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE PLAYERS IN YOUR REGION SO I HAVEN'T HAD THAT PERSONAL TOUCH THAT YOU HAVE. A SO I'M A LITTLE CONCERNED I DON'T HAVE A SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA COMPARED OF AYE I DID SERVE ON THE CTA BOARDED SERVE ON O. C. COG WHICH PROBABLY THE- THE COMPARABLE. TO WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE NOT TO SURE I'D BE EXCITED ABOUT THAT PROPOSITION OF THIS MODEL DOWN THERE WITH THOSE TWO. MUNICIPALITIES SO I'M I'M CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT WE'RE DOING IS A PRESIDENT BEEN LISTENING I'VE BEEN ABSTAINING ARE LAYING OFF. A EACH TIME. BUT IT'S A BIG STATE AND WE HAVE TO LOOK AT BEST PRACTICES. AND I'M JUST CONCERNED ABOUT A BOTTOM UP VERSUS THE TOP DOWN. MAYBE IT'S BETTER TO GO BOTTOM UP THAN THAT. YOU KNOW HAVEN'T CAM DIRECTED OUT OF SACRAMENTO ON HOW THINGS SHOULD BE DONE BUT I'M- I'M I'M A LITTLE. CONCERNED I'M NOT SURE IF THIS IS THE BEST APPROACH AND I. APOLOGIZE I MISSED YOUR THAT I'M READING IT AND LOOKING AT EVERY. EVERY MEETING I'M I'M I'M HERE AND I'M LISTENING. BUT I DON'T KNOW IF WE HAVE TIME YEARS TO WATCH IT FAIL OR SUCCEED. BECAUSE OF THE NEEDS SO I. I MAY BE LEANING MORE TOWARDS A NO AND I JUST WANTED TO PUT THAT ON THE RECORD THANK YOU MISTER. THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER VICE CHAIR VERY GRATEFUL FOR YOUR COMMENTS.
