PICTURE JERAD MEMBERS STATE BORDERS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF JOINT POWERS AUTHORITY HERE TODAY WITH AN IN BETWEEN POSITION AT THE PORT OF AMENDED LET ME BEGIN BY SAYING THAT WE ARE UNEQUIVOCALLY RENOUNCING RACISM AND DISCRIMINATION AND ANY FORM WE'VE PROVIDED AMENDMENTS THAT FURTHER CLARIFY EXISTING LAW WHICH PROHIBITS DISCRIMINATION IN PROVIDING WORKERS COMPENSATION BENEFITS. UNDER EXISTING LAW EVERY TIME A DOCTOR PREPARED A REPORT ON IF THE CLAIM TO WORKPLACE INJURY AS PERMANENTLY DISABLING THE PHYSICIAN MUST DETERMINE CAUSATION AND WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THE INJURIES DUE TO NON OCCUPATIONAL ISSUES INCLUDING PRIOR WORKPLACE INJURY IN. THIS PROCESS PORTION MEANT BASED ON THE PHYSICIAN'S REPORT AN INJURED WORKER'S PERMANENT DISABILITY OR EXPEDIA WARD AT THE JACKET APPROPRIATELY SO THAT THE EMPLOYERS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DISABILITY THAT CAUSED. BY INDUSTRIAL INJURY. ONLY A PHYSICIAN TO IF REPORT AND- ANSWER WHAT DEGREE. NOT EMPLOYER. NOT LAWYERS WHO HAVE THE IN AT THE APPLICATION ATTORNEYS ARE STILL WE COMPENSATED BASED ON A PERCENTAGE OF THE GDP AWARD. I REQUESTED AMENDMENT WOULD ENSURE THAT ANY APPORTIONMENT IT'S NOT DONE ON THE BASIS CONSIDERING WHAT SOMEONE MAY HAVE IDENTIFIED CHARACTERISTICS BUT RATHER UNSPECIFIC DIAGNOSABLE PATH OLOGY OR FACTORS THAT THEY ACTUALLY HAD. ONE FINAL NOTE ON APPORTIONMENT THE APPORTIONING OF ACADIA WAR IT HAS NO IMPACT ON AND ABILITY OF AN INJURED WORKER TO RECEIVE MEDICAL CARE EVEN IN THE EVENT THAT A PD AWARD AT THE PORTION MEDICAL CARE IF THE INJURY ARISES OR OCCURS IN THE COURSE OF EMPLOYMENT. AND MEDICAL CARE IS DETERMINED BY EVALUATING OR TREATING PHYSICIAN. MEDICAL CARE ITS EMPLOYER FUNDED THROUGH THEIR WORKERS COMPENSATION COVERAGE WE REMAIN COMMITTED TO THIS IMPORTANT CONVERSATION AND RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR THOUGHTFUL CONSIDERATION. OF OUR REQUEST FOR COMMENT AND THANK YOU. YES TO THE HARPER CAN FOR. IF I MAY IN THE MODERATOR- WE ARE NOW HEARINGFROM. TELECONFERENCE. IN SUPPORT NO.

WOULD YOU WANT TO BE CAREFUL THE WAY THAT THAT THAT THE WORD AND- APPORTIONMENT OF THE CRITICAL PIECE OF THE WORKERS COMPENSATION SYSTEM- FROM AN EMPLOYER PERSPECTIVE BECAUSE IT PROTECTS EMPLOYERS FOR PAYING FOR DISABILITY BUT SIMPLY WAS NOT CAUSED BY THE WORKPLACE.

GIVEN THE- THE AMOUNT OF PRESENTATION YOU HAVE TODAY HAVE MIGHT BE MORE COMFORTABLE FOR. OKAY. YES MISTER CHAIRS- SO JUST FOLLOW THE- FIGGIS. GIVE ME DIRECTION. YES WE ARE PREPARED THEN TO- SENATOR RAZA TO HEAR YOU ON SENATE BILL. SIXTY TWO. THE DAY BEFORE. BUT YES PLEASE SEE THANK YOU OKAY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND COLLEAGUES- OF MEN- MANY MEN AND WOMEN WHO DO ESSENTIAL WORK FOR ECONOMY AW% HAVE ACTUALLY BECOME MORE VISIBLE- FOR EXAMPLE GARMENT WORKERS ARE ESPECIALLY VULNERABLE IN THIS HEALTH AND ECONOMIC CRISIS. BECAUSE OF THE WIDESPREAD EXPLOITATION AND TRUE LACK OF ACCOUNTABILITY. EVEN NOW THESE VERY HIGHLY SKILLED PROFESSIONALS ARE PRODUCING PROTECTIVE MASKS SOMETIMES FOR AS LITTLE AS FIVE DOLLARS AN HOUR. DISRUPTIONS TO THE GLOBAL SUPPLY CHAIN FROM THIS PANDEMIC HAVE ALSO MOTIVATED COMPANIES TO SET UP SHOP IN LOS ANGELES. BECAUSE THEY BENEFIT FROM THE SKILLED CALIFORNIA'S FALLING BEHIND THE REST OF THE WORLD IN PROTECTIONS FOR THESE WORKERS. LOS ANGELES HAS THE HIGHEST CONCENTRATION OF GARMENT INDUSTRY WORKERS IN THE COUNTRY. WITH SOME TWO THOUSAND GARMENT MANUFACTURERS WHO EMPLOY ABOUT FORTY FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE. MOSTLY IMMIGRANT WOMEN WHO SPEND UP TO TEN TO TWELVE HOURS A DAY CUTTING SEWING AND DYING CLOTHING. FROM DESIGNER JEANS TO FAST FASHION RUNWAY TO FACE MASKS AND OTHER PP. SB SIXTY TWO MAKES CLEAR THAT A BUSINESS CONTRACTING TO HAVE. GARMENTS MADE IS LIABLE FOR UNPAID MINIMUM WAGE AND OVERTIME TO THE WORKERS WHO MANUFACTURE THOSE GARMENTS THAT'S WHAT IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE REGARDLESS OF HOW MANY LAYERS OF CONTRACTING. THAT COMPANY MAY USE THIS BILL WILL END THE MINIMUM WAGE CAR ABOUT IN THE GARMENT INDUSTRY WHICH ALLOWS MANUFACTURERS. TO PAY WORKERS BY THE PIECE OR PIECE RATE. NOT ONLY DOES THE PIECE RATE SYSTEM ENABLE AND EVEN JUSTIFY SUB MINIMUM WAGE IT ALSO CREATES UNSAFE WORKING CONDITIONS AS GARMENT WORKERS ARE CONSTANTLY RACING AGAINST THE CLOCK. TO COMPLETE AS MANY ITEMS AS POSSIBLE. MANUFACTURERS HAVE NO INCENTIVE TO ENSURE SAFE CONDITIONS OR THE PROPER MINIMUM WAGE AND OVERTIME PAYMENTS. FOR THE WORKERS PRODUCING THE GARMENTS UNLESS THEY FACE LIABILITY. COLLEAGUES ARE BACK TO THE DAYS OF THE TRIANGLE SHIRTWAIST FIRE CONDITIONS IN NEW YORK IN NINETEEN ELEVEN IT HAS TO BE FIXED. THESE WORKPLACE VIOLATIONS DEEPLY AFFECT BALL NOBLE WORKERS AND FRANKLY. MORE DEEPLY AFFECT THE RESILIENCE OF LOCAL COMMUNITIES AS THE LARGEST INDUSTRY OF ITS KIND IN THE U. S. THE APPAREL MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY IN L. A. COUNTY PRODUCES. ALMOST FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN TOTAL ANNUAL OUTPUT. SO THESE WORKERS ARE TRULY THE END ENGINE THAT KEEPS THE FASHION INDUSTRY MOVING UP WE'VE ALL HEARD IN THE SENATE BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE. LAST MONTH WAGE THEFT IS SO ENTRENCHED IN THE GARMENT INDUSTRY THAT THE STATE RESTITUTION FUND HAS BEEN ON THE BRINK OF INSOLVENCY SINCE TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN. BECAUSE THE PROVEN CLAIMS FOR STOLEN WAGES WERE MORE THAN THE ACCOUNT COULD KEEP UP KEEP UP WITH MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED PEOPLE ARE ON THIS FUNDS WAIT LIST. FOR COMPENSATION FOR UNPAID WAGES TOTALING MORE THAN TEN MILLION DOLLARS. THE RESTITUTION FUND IS SUPPOSED TO BE A PAYER OF LAST RESORT. NOT THE ONLY WAY FOR THESE HIGHLY SKILLED WORKERS TO GET LEGAL WAGES. WE NEED TO END THE LOOPHOLES AND STOPPED STOP THE BAD ACTOR MANUFACTURERS FROM AVOIDING LIABILITY. THESE LOOPHOLES ALSO HAVE MADE THE INDUSTRY HOSTILE TO ETHICAL GARMENT COMPANIES WHO ARE TRYING TO ELIMINATE SWEATSHOPS THEY'RE TRYING TO BUILD A MORE INCLUSIVE AND FAIR GARMENT INDUSTRY ECONOMY. AND ENSURE THAT WHEN WE SAY MADE IN THE USA IT REPRESENTS QUALITY AND JUSTICE THAT IS WHY. ALMOST ONE HUNDRED FASHION ORGANIZATIONS AND BUSINESSES. HAVE JOINED OUR EFFORTS THIS YEAR WITH SB SIXTY TWO AND IT IS ALSO THE LEGISLATIVE WOMEN'S CAUCUS PRIORITY BILL. TODAY WE HAVE- ALL OF THE TWO WITNESSES ON THE LINE.

THE CONTENT OF THIS BILL SEEKS TO PREVENT SUCH AS THE FAILURE TO PAY MINIMUM WAGE FOR PEACE FRAMEWORK AND UNSAFE WORKING CONDITIONS IS ALREADY ILLEGAL INSTEAD OF TAKING ACTION AGAINST HIS GARMENT MANUFACTURERS THAT ARE VIOLATING THE LAW THE BILL HAS A DANGEROUS PRECEDENT REGARDING JOINT LIABILITY AND ALLOW COMPANIES TO CONTINUE TO ACT UNLAWFULLY BY PASSING THEIR LIABILITY FOR WAGE CLAIMS THE COMPANIES THAT HAVE NO CONTROL OVER GARMENT WORKERS. THEIR WAGES OR WORKING CONDITIONS AND DID NOT DIRECTLY CONTRACTED THE COMPANY UNITED VIOLATING THE LAW EXEMPLIFIES THAT WOULD BRING A NEW CATEGORY OF COMPANIES THAT ARE LIABLE FOR GARMENT WORKER WAGE CLAIMS CALL BRAND GUARANTORS RAIN HERE IN GEORGIA BROADLY DEFINED AND INCLUDES COMPANIES IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN INVOLVED THE LICENSING MAKING TRYING EVERYTHING- ABLE TO OR OTHERWISE ALTERING A GARMENT IN ANY WAY IN CALIFORNIA. NOT ONLY DOES THE BILL EXPAND MY ABILITY BUT IT ALSO PUT FRANK GUARANTORS DISAPPEAR DISADVANTAGE OF A CLAIM IS FILED THE BILL CHANGES EXISTING EVIDENTIARY STANDARDS FOR GARMENT WORKERS WAGE CLAIM BY SABOTAGING THE PRESUMPTION THAT ONE THE RESPONDENT IS A BRAND GUARANTOR UNDER THE BILL INTO THAT THE WORKERS CLAIM AND THE AMOUNT CLEAN ALL VALID AND ACCURATE. A BRING YOUR TOWARDS LIABILITY IS NOT LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT OF TIME THE WORKERS SPENT ON A PIECE OF CLOTHING RELATED TO THAT COMPANY ANY WORKER COULD WALK IN WITH A SHORT CONTINUAL. SAY THEY DIED IN ALTERNATE I THINK THE LABEL TO WEAR OR MADE IT AND ON THE COMPANY'S LOGO IT IS NOW PRESUMED TO BE 1100% LIABLE FOR ALL OF THE EMPLOYEES WAGE AT IT DOES NOT MATTER IF THE WORKER ONLY SPENT 1% OF THEIR TIME WORKING ON THAT PIECE OF CLOTHING. OR ANY OTHER CLOTHING WITH THE COMPANY'S LOGO ON. THE BILL ALSO LIMITS EVIDENCE CAN BE YOU TO DEFEND AGAINST WAGE CLAIM. FOR EXAMPLE THE BILL X. FOR THAT HE- THE OF WEIGHT AS- THE BRAIN HERE AND FOR. BY PAY WERE RECORDS RECORD OF OUR WORKED BY THAT IN. ALL OF WHICH BELONG SOME OTHER COMPANY. BRAND GEARED TOWARD THAT NO CAN OVER. ACCESS TO ANY THAT IN. WILL HAVE BILL TO PROVIDE THESE BACK. NOR SHOULD THEY BE. TO MAINTAIN PAYROLL OR KEEPING OR- FOR COME. WITH WHICH THEY HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO INTERACTION YOU KNOW CONTROL. IN SOME THIS BILL DOES NOT ADDRESS THE ISSUES OF COMPANIES FLOUTING ALREADY ESTABLISHED LAW. INSTEAD IT ALLOWS COMPANIES TO CONTINUE ON AS USUAL AND ALTERNATELY THE TURKISH. FROM HAVING CLOTHING MADE IN THE. STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU. USER ANOTHER OPPOSITION WITNESS TO HEAR FROM. HEARING NONE WILL MOVE ON FINNEY WITNESSES HERE IN THE COMMITTEE ROOM THAT ARE HERE TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION- BEYOND- WILL.

THANK YOU. AND WE HAVE NO FURTHER OPPOSITION IN QUEUE AT THIS TIME THANK YOU MOTOR THANK YOU TO ALL THE SUPPORT OPPOSITION FORCES WITNESSES IT WILL NOT BRING THE DISCUSSION BACK TO THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS. THE CENTER NEWMAN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. CENTER RUNS RIGHT I COMMEND YOU. FOR TAKING UP THIS ISSUE- IN DEFENSE AND PROTECTION OF GARMENT WORKERS CALIFORNIA NO CALIFORNIA WORKERS SHOULD BE SUBJECT TO EXPLOITATION. AND AT THIS MOMENT THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO EXCUSE FOR A WORKER IN OUR STATE NOT BE PAID AT LEAST MINIMUM WAGE. I DO HAVE TWO QUESTIONS- AND I THINK THE WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION ACTUALLY TOUCHED ON EACH. ONE IT'S REGARDING EXISTING LAW SO THE ASSERTION WAS MADE THAT THE EXISTING LAWS RESULT OF RELATIVELY RECENT PRIOR CHANGES TO THE ROME STATUTE. SHOULD HAVE EQUIPPED THE LABOR COMMISSION WITH TOOLS SUFFICIENT TO PUNISH AND DETER BAD ACTORS IN THE GARMENT SPACE. SO AT LEAST FOR THE RECORD I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT ON THE LOGIC OF YOUR BILL THIS IS CLEARLY NOT THE CASE WOULD YOU MIND ELABORATING- ABOVE MY- SURE WHICH- BILL YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT- SIR NEWMAN. THERE WAS A BILL- IN TWENTY FIFTEEN- THE LEóN SB FIVE EIGHTY EIGHT IT WAS NOT A GARMENT INDUSTRY SPECIFIC BILL- AND IT DOES IT WAS MEANT TO HELP IN THE IN THE COLLECTION BUT- THAT'S DIFFERENT FROM WHAT WE'RE ARE TRYING TO DO HERE TODAY- SO UNLESS THERE'S A DIFFERENT BILL I GUESS IN IN VERY GENERAL TERMS THE I GUESS THE PROBLEM WE'RE TRYING TO SOLVE THIS IS YOUR- SENSES THAT THERE SIMPLY AREN'T TOOLS. IN PLACE RIGHT NOW TO PROTECT GARMENT WORKERS AGAINST PEACE WORK- AND BY D'EXPLOITATION. WELL THE WE HAD OF A OF A BILL SEVERAL YEARS AGO THAT WE THOUGHT WAS GOING TO TAKE CARE OF THE PROBLEM AND IT DID FOR A FEW YEARS UNTIL- EMPLOYERS BEGAN TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE LOOPHOLES AND WE STARTED BACK DOWN THE ROAD OF A VOID IN THIS- IT IS NOT A MATTER OF JUST- ENFORCING THE LAW WE HAVE TO GIVE THE TOOLS FOR THE LABOR AGENCY TO BE ABLE TO ENFORCE THE LAW WITH A LOT MORE TEETH TO IT- AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE IS THAT UPSTREAM THE LIABILITY. ONE ALSO MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR THESE WORKERS TO BE ABLE TO WORK AND ACTUALLY EARN THE MINIMUM WAGE WITHOUT BEING TOLD HERE'S A PIECE RATE AND THAT'S WHAT YOU SHOULD FOLLOW UP BUT PRIMARILY IT'S ABOUT FIGHTING FINDING- GETTING LIABILITY FROM THE UPSTREAM- COMPANIES- WHICH AGAIN JUST YOU KNOW. TURN TO TURN THEIR HEAD AND REFUSED TO TAKE ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHAT IS GOING ON FOR THE WORKERS THAT ARE PRODUCING- THE- THE PRODUCTS THAT THEY'RE LOOKING FOR AND IT'S JUST SHOULDN'T BE THAT WAY SO WE'RE TRYING TO MORE LIABILITY UPSTREAM GIVE THE WORKERS- THE ABILITY TO PARTICIPATE IN PROVIDING THE EVIDENCE. YOU KNOW THERE'S NOBODY LIMIT IS ELIMINATING ANY DUE PROCESS RIGHTS IT JUST CLARIFIES- THESE- THE EVIDENCE EVIDENTIARY PRESUMPTIONS I THINK IT'S VERY CHOI SO I GUESS IT'S LIKE I'VE SPOKEN TO A BUNCH OF FOLKS. WHO THEIR DATE THEY HAVE. NOT A PROBLEM WITH BRAND CONSCIOUS IS DEFINED GUESS USE COMMITTEE. TERMINOLOGY THE OTHER QUESTIONS HOW FAR UPSTREAM MAY HELP FOR EXTREME IS USEFUL. AND IT YOU KNOW DOES IT SHOULD APPLY EQUALLY TO LICENSE SHORES AND LICENSEES RIGHT SO DO YOU KNOW IF A COMPANY THAT LICENSES A BRAND. I SHOULD ABSOLUTELY BE HELD RESPONSIBLE BUT THE ARGUMENT IS IF I'M A LICENSE OR YOU KNOW LET LET'S SAY THAT PEPPA PIG ENTERTAIN BUT HERE'S WHAT TYPE OF TAKE WHICH IS A FIVE YEAR OLD DAUGHTER. YOU'LL HAVE TO WATCH ALL ONE THOUSAND EPISODES BUT YOU KNOW VERY SUCCESSFUL BRANDS AND LICENSED TO A FARE THEE WELL. BY THAT LICENSURE HAS A VERY LIMITED. AMOUNT OF INSIDER LEVERAGE ON LICENSEES WHO SIMPLY. YOU KNOW LICENSE THE BRAND AND THEN YOU KNOW PROCEED TO CONTRACT OUT. FOR THE PROTECTION OF PRICE AND SELL THEM IN THE MARKET PLACE. AND SO. YOU KNOW IT IT IS NOT UNLIKELY. SAID A LICENSE OR CONCERNED ABOUT THE LIABILITY CREATED BY THIS PROVISION. WHICH SHOULD BE LICENSE THEIR PRODUCTS TO NON CALIFORNIA FIRMS. MADE THAT THAT WOULD BE I THINK THE NATURAL RESPONSE- GIVEN THE LIABILITY CREATED SO. IT YOU KNOW IS THERE ANY THINKING TO TIGHTEN UP THE DEFINITION OR GIVE SOME CONSIDERATION THAT FACT. OUT OF OUT OF DEFERENCE TO THAT POSSIBILITY- SIR NEWMAN WE'D BE GLAD TO THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT ANYBODY'S REACHED- RAISE THIS ISSUE- LAST YEAR THE BILL. CAME CLOSE WE WERE AT WE HIT THE DEADLINE THE TIMING OF IT OR I'M SURE IT WOULD'VE IT WOULD'VE GONE ALL THE WAY- SO. YOU KNOW AT YOUR REQUEST TO BE GLAD TO LOOK AT IT BUT I JUST WANT TO REMIND US THAT. WE DON'T WANT TO CUT BY FIXING THAT. IN THE EYES OF SOME COMPANIES WE DON'T WANT TO THEN CREATE ANOTHER LEGAL LOOPHOLE WHICH COULD BE USED- BY OTHERS AND IT. YOU KNOW MY ONLY CONCERN IS CREATING A WHOLE NEW LAYER. OF CONTRACTING OUT- SO THAT'S ONE AND ALSO THERE ARE. COMPANIES WHO HAVE. WHO WOULD DO. A FUNCTION AS A LICENSE OR- THEY ALSO CAN TAKE A WE'RE NOT INCLUDING THAT HERE BUT- THEY CAN TAKE THEIR OWN ACTIONS. OF THE COULD CONTRACT WITH YOU KNOW ETHICAL GARMENT MANUFACTURERS THEY COULD ENTER INTO INDEMNITY CLAUSES- IN CASE. YOU KNOW THAT THEY DON'T PAY- THE PROPER WAGES AND WAGE AND HOUR. OF A REQUIREMENTS SO I THINK THERE ARE THINGS THAT CAN BE DONE THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO REQUIRE. THE PROBLEM IS IF WE HAVE TO STEP IN EVERY SINGLE TIME THERE'S A NEW LOOPHOLE CREATED OR THEY TAKE ADVANTAGE OF CREATE A NEW LOOPHOLE. SO I'LL BE GLAD TO. GET BACK WITH RIGHT I APPRECIATE ON FURTHER ON FURTHER- THOUGHT ON OUR PART I DO APPRECIATE SO UNITS OF THE ARMY HERE IS THAT. IT IS WE THE LEGISLATION THEY'RE THEY'RE CREATING THIS NEW CONCEPT BY THE DEFINITION ABOUT BRAND LICENSED. BRAND GUARANTOR. SO IMPROV WORTH CONSIDERING THE INPUT FOR THE ON A TEN CONSEQUENCE SO I. IT WILL BE SUPPORTED TO. THANK YOU. EIGHTY FURTHER DISCUSSION OF COMMON FROM THE COMMITTEE MMHM NUMBER I SURE. SO I HAVE TO SAY THE BOTH MY GROW. THAT WERE AT. I GUESS YOU COULD SAY THE BABY CLOTHING THEY SELL CLOTHING FOR A WHILE MY FAQ I'M JUST MEASURE LITTLE PERSONAL STORY MY GRANDMOTHER USED TO SO THE CLOTHING AND MY GRANDFATHER WOULD TAKE IT INTO THE CITY TO SELL IT IN MEXICO SO- AND I WORKED AS A IN A TAILOR SHOP WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL SO. I'M REALLY DISAPPOINTED TO HEAR THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT BEING PAID THEIR WAGES- THAT IS JUST A HORRIBLE THING ESPECIALLY HERE IN CALIFORNIA- BUT I DO HAVE A COUPLE OF CONCERNS BECAUSE WE DO HAVE CURRENTLY. MINIMUM WAGE- REQUIREMENTS OR MANDATES IN IN THE STATE. AND- WOULD IT BE AND THIS IS JUST I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND BECAUSE RIGHT NOW IN MY IN MY VIEW MY PERSPECTIVE THIS IS AN ENFORCEMENT ISSUE BECAUSE- OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE BAD ACTORS RIGHT THERE WHO ARE NOT FOLLOWING THE LAW. AM I CORRECT. YES OKAY SO. AND HELP AND HELP EDUCATE ME ON THIS AND WHO IS SUPPOSED TO BE ENFORCING THESE MINIMUM WAGE LAWS SO THAT PEOPLE GET PAID WELL THERE'S AN LABOR AGENCY- WHERE YOU CAN GO AND FILE A COMPLAINT- WHAT WE HAVE FOUND IS AND YOU HEARD- MUCH F THE OF THE TESTIMONY ONE WOMAN WHO COMPLAINED FIRST TO HER EMPLOYER BROUGHT IT TO THE ATTENTION TO IMPORTANT SO YOU'RE NOT PAYING ME MINIMUM WAGE- AND HE PROMISES TO. PAY THE MINIMUM WAGE PAY HER ACCURATELY AND THEN SHE COMES IN TO WORK THE FOLLOWING WEEK AND THEY CLOSE DOWN SO THIS INDUSTRY IS FULL OF THESE VERY VERY SMALL AND- COMPANIES THEY CAN JUST CLOSE DOWN AND THEN THE FOLLOWING WEEK SHOW UP YOU KNOW NEXT DOOR UNDER A NEW NAME AND SO THIS WEB OF CONTRACTORS- IS THE FIRST YOU KNOW HUGE PROBLEM AND THE SECOND IS THAT YOU GO UP UPSTREAM WITH THESE COMPANIES WHO ORDER OR WHO ARE CONNECTED WITH THE PRODUCT THAT THEY'RE MAKING. AND THEY'RE NOT TAKING ANY RESPONSIBILITY AND THEY'D KNOWN MANY TIMES THAT THEY'RE NOT PAYING. THE ADDED. TO THAT COMPANY. TO BE ABLE TO MAKE A PROFIT AND THEN PAY THEIR WORKERS BUT WHAT THEY GIVE TO THAT THOSE CONTRACTORS IS SO LOW. THAT THAT CONTRACTOR COULD NEVER REALLY. GET A PROFIT WITHOUT- CHEATING THE WORKERS FROM THEIR MINIMUM WAGE. SIR MANY WAYS IN WHICH THIS UP THE SYSTEM HAS LED TO THESE WORKERS NOT BEING ABLE TO GET THE WAGES THAT THEY DESERVE. SO WE HAVE TO COME IN AND CLOSE THE LOOPHOLES SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE ALL THESE WORKERS CHEATED OUT OF THEIR WAGES. I WAS ON SUBCOMMITTEE THE REASON I GOT INVOLVED IN THIS AS I WAS ON THE BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE. THAT PHAM OVERSAW THIS A RESTITUTION FUND AND I WAS JUST SHOCKED THAT THERE WAS WORKER AFTER WORKER AFTER WORKER AT THAT TIME WHO WOULD SHOW UP- AND SAYING- I GOT MY COMPLAIN MY CASE WAS ADJUDICATED. AND I HAVEN'T STILL HAVEN'T BEEN PAID FOR ONE TWO OR THREE YEARS. SO IT'S NOT FOR LACK OF TRYING. EITHER FROM THE WORKERS OR FROM THE LABOR AGENCY IT'S JUST THAT IT'S SO RAMPANT AND THEY NEED TO HOLD. SOMEBODY HIGHER UP ON THE CHAIN RESPONSIBLE OR ELSE WE'RE JUST GOING TO BE CHASING OUR TAILS AND NOT REALLY SOLVING THE PROBLEM. SO WOULD YOU TAKE THAT LOGIC IN GO ONE FURTHER STEP UP AND SAY THAT THE CONSUMERS AND THE STORES. SHOULD BE PENALIZED WELL. HELD ACCOUNTABLE AS A PENALIZED ACCOUNTABLE NO BECAUSE NOPE I DON'T THINK SO BECAUSE THEY'RE THE ONES BUYING THE PRODUCT THEY'RE NOT HAVING IN. ASKING FOR THE PRODUCT TO BE MADE. OKAY- MY CONCERN HERE IS THAT WE'RE- THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO ENFORCE WHAT YOUR INTENT IS IF WE CAN'T ENFORCE THE MINIMUM WAGE. REQUIREMENT IN CALIFORNIA WITH THESE PEOPLE WITH THESE COMPANIES THESE- WOULD YOU CALL IT UNETHICAL EMPLOYERS- I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND HOW YOU'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT IN THIS WITH THIS BILL. WHAT WE AGAIN WE MAKE IT CLEAR THAT EVEN IF YOU'RE HIGHER UP IN THE CHAIN THAT YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE- AND SECOND IS WE HAVE TO SUPPORT THE BUSINESSES THAT ARE. PAYING THE WAGES THAT ARE PAYING THE OF ARE FOLLOWING THE LAW AND THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT AS WELL BECAUSE IF WE KEEP LETTING THESE OTHER BUSINESSES GET AWAY WITH CHEATING. THAT MAKES IT HARDER FOR THESE ETHICAL BUSINESSES TO COME TO COMPETE AND THAT'S EXCITING AND I YOU KNOW I APPLAUD ALL OF THE BUSINESSES THAT CALLED IN AND SUPPORT THAT PART OF THIS COALITION. AND IS SAYING WE WANT TO DO THE RIGHT THING BUT WE HAVE TO THE REASON THEY'RE SUPPORTING SB SIXTY TWO IS BECAUSE- THEY ALSO SEE. THE LOOPHOLES THEY'RE NOT TRYING TO USE LOOPHOLES THESE OTHER COMPANIES ARE USING THE LOOPHOLES AND TRYING TO EVADE RESPONSIBILITY SO WE'RE DOING THAT NOT ONLY FOR THE- MEN AND WOMEN WHO WORK. WE'RE ALSO DOING IT FOR THE BUSINESSES THAT ARE DOING THE RIGHT THING BEING RESPONSIBLE AND DON'T WANT- YOU KNOW DON'T WANT TO BE PUT IN THE SITUATION THEY'RE NOT TRYING TO CHEAT THE WORKERS. I'M JUST A LITTLE CONCERNED THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE PENALIZING PEOPLE WHO DO FOLLOW THE LAW. FOR THE PEOPLE THAT DO NOT THAT'S THE ONLY CONCERN THAT I HAVE ON WITH THIS BILL. BUT BELIEVE ME WE'RE NOT TRYING TO PUNISH ANYBODY WHO FOLLOWS THE LAW. THESE WORKERS ONLY ONE. TO GET THEIR MONEY AT THE END OF THE DAY BUT THE WORK SO HARD FOR THE UPSTREAM MINES I MEAN ON THAT AND IT'S JUST THAT I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE I AM IN ALL. HONESTY I MEAN ALL THAT IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE PEOPLE THAT CAN GET AWAY WITH THIS AND SHE PEOPLE OUT OF THEIR MINIMUM WAGE- AND THAT'S NOT TO SAY THAT. HIS IT BY A- PER GARMENT- THREE PIECE RATE IF YOU COULD HAVE THAT I MEAN YOU COULD HAVE THAT IF THEY WERE PAYING MINIMUM WAGE RIGHT YES OKAY YES- WE- SIMPLY SAY THAT IT SHOULDBE A BONUS ON OP OF WHATEVER THE MINIMUM WAGES. THEY COULD PROVIDE BONUS WHICH OF COURSE IS A- YOU KNOW THAT'S A FINE THING TO DO THAT'S A GOOD THING TO DO IN THE WORKERS. WOULD WOULD LIKE THAT BUT NOT NOT SOMETHING THAT PENALIZES THEM. YEAH I'M JUST I'M JUST CONCERNED HONESTLY SENATE ROTH I'M JUST REALLY CONCERNED THE FACT THAT. I'M NOT SURE THAT THIS IS. TRULY GOING TO. IMPACT PEOPLE WHO ALREADY ARE GETTING AWAY WITH IT- IN THIS SCENARIO- BUT I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING HOW WE SUPPORTED AT THIS TIME- I'M GONNA STEAM BUT I AM LOOK FORWARD TO SEE HOW. YOU'RE ABLE TO INCORPORATE THE ENFORCEMENT OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE TRULY NOT% FOLLOWING- OUR LAWS- RATING CURRENTLY IN PLACE AND WHY WE AS YOU KNOW AS THE LEGISLATURE IN IN PEOPLE IN OUR ENTITIES OR AGENCIES WHO ARE ALREADY IN PLACE ARE NOT ABLE TO ENFORCE WHAT'S ALREADY IN ON OR UNDER LAWCENTER BOOKS. THANK YOU RINPOCHE WHICH A CLOSE AND GROW. I RESPECT ON BEHALF OF ALL THOSE HARD WORKING MEN AND WOMEN RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS THANK YOU. WE CAN ENTERTAIN A MOTION.

OF IT IS A WIDE SPREAD OF NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS LARGE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS AND COMPLEX IN TERMS OF CERTAIN CONSPIRACIES AND IN THE US WE NEED SOMEONE TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR ORGANIZING THIS EFFORTS STATEWIDE AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL PROPOSES THAT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL HAVE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL APPOINTED TASK FORCE AND THAT THAT TASK FORCE AND TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR OF THE RECOVERY IN PARTICULAR BUT PROSECUTION AND THE COLLECTION OF RESOURCES TO BE ABLE TO FUND THAT IT'S VERY SIMPLE BILL- I EXPECTED THE THEY'LL BE SOME OTHER INPUT ALONG THE WAY BUT I WOULD URGE AN AYE VOTE.

AND AT THE TIME WE HAVE NO COME IN Q. FOUR OPPOSITION OF SB TWENTY. SPOKE WELL THANK YOU TOLD THEM THOSE WHO DID SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF OPPOSITION AND WE'RE NOW GOING TO. BRING THE DISCUSSION BACK. TO THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS SO- HERE SOMEONE EARLIER THE BILL. OKAY IT AND DONE BEFORE WE ASK YOU A- SEN ROBERT TO CLOSE I JUST I HAVE A QUICK QUESTION I AM IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL CENTER BERGEN I. APPLAUD YOU FOR. BRINGING FORWARD- SOME KIND OF SOLUTION TO THE- PUTTING THE RESTITUTION THAT SO MANY OF US HAVE GIVEN. UP LOOKING FOR HOPING FOR AND TRYING TO FIND A PATHWAY FOR HERE- THIS IS REALLY JUST- ASKING MAYBE FOR A LITTLE FORESHADOWING IN TERMS OF- IN TERMS OF THE MECHANICS THAT YOU SPOKE ABOUT IN YOUR OPENING. THEN IT MAY BE A LITTLE BIT MORE INFORMATION ON THAT- ESPECIALLY AS A MEMBER OF BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE FIVE AYE I HAVE. THIS CURIOSITY AS TO WHETHER OR NOT WE'RE GOING TO SEE- SOME KIND OF A REQUEST FOR. A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF FULL TIME EQUIVALENT AUGMENTATION. IN ORDER TO GET TO THIS POINT WHERE- OF THIS UNFORTUNATE MASS OF. WHAT APPEARS TO BE A MASSIVE AMOUNT OF FRAUD BASED ON THE AUDITOR'S REPORT CAN ACTUALLY BE TACKLED WITH ANY KIND OF. CAPACITY OR SCALE AND THEN I UNDERSTAND WITH YOUR- WITH YOUR BILL. BY THE CONCEPT IN THE BILL EVENTS THAT WOULD BE. COST RECOVERY- BUT DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT THOSE METRICS LOOK LIKE IN TERMS OF WHAT IT'S REALLY GOING TO TAKE A- I KNOW YOU HAVE A BACKGROUND- YOUR SOFA IN THE LAW AND I JUST. CURIOUS AS TO. WHAT YOU ANTICIPATE WE MIGHT BE LOOKING AT SOME POINT IN TERMS OF SCALE. SO- FIRST ANY ORGANIZED EFFORT AND THIS IS A COMPLEX EFFORT TO ORGANIZE NEEDS ONE PERSON OR ENTITY IN CHARGE AND THAT'S THE FIRST PRINCIPLE THE SECOND PRINCIPLES IS FOR THEM TO ASSESS WHAT IS IT WE'RE GOING TO NEED THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS A VERY LARGE ROLE TO PLAY- AND SO I WOULD EXPECT THAT THIS TASK FORCE WITH THE AG IN CHARGE WOULD FIRST DO AN ASSESSMENT WHAT DO WE THINK WE CAN REASONABLY RECOVER I'VE HEARD DIFFERENT ESTIMATES OF ONE ESTIMATE IS BASED THINK WE CAN RECOVER 10% OF THE FRAUD WELL. IF IT'S TEN BILLION DOLLARS THAT'S BILLION DOLLARS THAT'S THAT'S ACTUAL MONEY- AND WHAT RESOURCES ARE GOING TO BE REQUIRED IN AN OLD NEED TO BE A COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS SO IF FOR EXAMPLE WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO SPEND TICKET NUMBER TEN MILLION DOLLARS IN ADDITIONAL PROSECUTORIAL INVESTIGATIVE RESOURCES IN ORDER TO RECOVER BILLION DOLLARS THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD INVESTMENT- BUT WE DON'T KNOW RIGHT NOW IN THAT AND THAT'S REALLY THE PURPOSE OF THE BILL SO WE CAN GET OURSELVES ORGANIZED AND DO THE COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS. AND THEN HOUSING CONTEMPLATED THAT THE COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS WOULD COME BACK WITH A B. BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE OR- WHO IS A TASK FORCE IN REPORT. SO CLEARLY IF ANY ADDITIONAL RESOURCES ARE REQUIRED. THEY WOULD HAVE TO THE AG OR- WHATEVER ENTITY IS CREATED WOULD HAVE TO COME BACK TO THE TO THE LEGISLATURE AND ASK THE THAT THAT BE FUNDED SO- THAT WE WILL BE RELATIVELY SHORT LEASH ON US. BUT WE NEED IN MY VIEW WE NEED WE NEED TO GET STARTED. FIGURING ALL THIS OUT OF THE MONEY THAT WAS STOLEN- IS BEING QUICKLY DISSIPATED AND TO THE EXTENT THAT THAT- WE TAKE TOO MUCH TIME- WE'RE WE'RE LOSING MONEY. AS WE SORT OF FIGURE THIS THING OUT SO THAT THAT'S WHY I'M ANXIOUS TO GET THIS BALL ROLLING. VERY GOOD. POINT WELL TAKEN THANK YOU FOR ADDRESSING THOSE ISSUES AND- I WILL IN FACT BE SUPPORTING THE BILL BUT- IF YOU'D LIKE TO CLOSE NINETY MINUTE. I'M SORRY CENTER NEWMAN. I'M SORRY MR IT REALLY ONE QUICK- IF YOU YES YOU MAY OF THE CENTER BUMMER IN THE I A RIGHTEOUS YEAH AND OVER BUT TO DO THAT SUCH AS AMOUNT HAS BEEN RECOVERED FAR- AND ALSO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THAT MOST OF THE FUNDS AS I UNDERSTAND IT THAT HAVE BEEN FRAUDULENTLY. DIVERTED HAVE WHERE ARE GUARANTEED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT MADE A CHOICE ARE WE MAKING A DISTINCTION HERE BETWEEN THOSE FUNDS THOSE TWO INCREMENTS IN THAT THE VERY LARGE NUMBER THAT'S GUARANTEED. BY THE CURES ACT VERSUS THE SMALLER UNDERSTOOD ALL FUNDS- THAT IF CHAU AREN'T WE- LIBEL TO RETURN THOSE FUNDS TO THE FEDERAL. TO IS WORKING HOW DO WE COUNT THAT- THE DANCE TO THE IS. MOST THE FUNDS ARE FEDERAL FUN THAT IS CORRECT THE STATE HAS SOME. INVESTMENT IN THIS AS WELL- IN SO WE DO NEED AS IS PART OF THE- TASK BEFORE US IS TO WORK OUT WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT EXACTLY HOW WE'RE GOING TO PORTION. BOTH THE EXPENSES AS WELL AS THE RECOVERY IT WOULD BE MY VIEW THAT TO THE EXTENT THAT CALIFORNIA BEST RESOURCES AND RECOVERS MONEY. IT WEEK WE SHOULD. BE ABLE TO- ACCEPTED SPEND WHATEVER REAR COVER NOW I EXPECT THAT THERE MAY BE OTHER POINTS OF VIEW ON THIS ON THIS. BUT AGAIN- IN IN TO YOUR POINT TO IN TERMS OF RECOVERY- THAT. IF WE CAN RECOVER 10% THAT WOULD BE GREAT. YES IT'S GETTING HARDER AND HARDER AND WE'VE NOT RECOVERED MUCH WE DON'T HAVE A COORDINATED EFFORT AT THIS POINT IN TIME. AND TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE WERE. YOU KNOW LARGE SCALE CONSPIRACIES THAT WERE ENGAGED IN STEALING THIS MONEY I EXPECT IS PROBABLY OVERSEAS WOULD PROBABLY HAVE TO TRACE IT TO. PLACES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. I APPRECIATE THAT TO WHAT RISK TO. THE COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS. IS YOU DO YOU ANTICIPATE ONE COST BENEFIT ELSE JUST WORKING AND TO THE ANALYSIS OR WOULD THERE BE. TUE QUESTION ONES BASED ON WHAT YOU'VE LEARNED WERE WHAT WE'VE LEARNED IS WE'VE GONE I EXPECT PUTTING THE AG AND CHARGED WITH THIS TASK FORCE IN THE G. TO REPORT BACK TO US TO SAY HERE'S- HERE'S WHAT I THINK IT'S GOING TO COST TO RECOVER. X. AMOUNT OF MONEY IF THE AG RIGHT NOW WE DON'T HAVE ANY TYPE OF THE AG COMES BACK AND SAYS LOOK AT ALL THAT MONEY'S. YOU KNOW OF OVERSEAS AND WE CAN'T GET ANY OF IT AND SO THERE'S NO USE IN EVEN TRYING WELL THEN I SUPPOSE WE HAVE TO ACCEPT THAT I HOPE THAT'S NOT THE RESULT. OF BUT THAT'S WHAT I WOULD EXPECT IS THAT HE OR SHE WOULD REPORT BACK TO US AND THEN TO THE EXTENT THAT IT'S OF USE OF THEIR RESOURCES NECESSARY. THAT HE OR SHE S. FOR THOSE RESOURCES. THE SHIP IT'S LIKE I SAID THEY WERE. EFFORT ND I'D BE GRATEFUL AS YOU MOVE THIS FORWARD BE EDITORS AS A CO AUTHOR. THANK YOU OF THE SCENE.

THE LABOR OF DOMESTIC WORKERS TO CARE FOR THEIR HOMES AND FAMILIES. THERE PRIMARILY IMMIGRANT WOMEN- THEY'RE ESSENTIAL TO OUR ECONOMY AND I BELIEVE WE SHOULD GIVE THEM S. SAME CONSIDERATION FOR HEALTH AND SAFETY ISSUES. WE SHOULD NOT EXCLUDE WORKERS FROM DURING THIS HEALTH PANDEMIC NOR DURING THE WILDFIRES THAT BURNED THROUGH OUR STATE. AW OR JUST THE EVERYDAY WORK THAT THEY DO- TO PROTECT THE FAMILIES IN THOSE HOUSEHOLDS. DURING THE WILDFIRES THAT DEVASTATED CALIFORNIA HOUSEHOLD DOMESTIC WORKERS EMPLOYEES. WERE ASKED TO STAY BEHIND TO FIGHT FIRES GUARD HOMES AND PETS WORK IN SMOKY CONDITIONS AND EVEN CLEAN UP TOXIC ASH SOME IMPLORED EMPLOYERS EVEN FAILED TO TELL MANY OF THEM. THAT THE HOMES THEY WERE WORKING THAT WERE ORDERS. THE CURRENT CORPORATE NINETEEN HEALTH PANDEMIC HAS ONLY MAGNIFIED THE DANGERS- AND THE LACK OF SAFETY THAT DOMESTIC WORKERS AND DAY LABORERS FACE ON A DAILY BASIS. AS OUR WORLD AS OUR WILDFIRES GROW IN FREQUENCY AND INTENSITY- AND THE PANDEMIC RAVAGES OUR LOW INCOME INCOME COMMUNITIES IT'S TIME FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO MOVE PAST THE LEGACY OF EXCLUSION. THAT WOMEN OF COLOR HAVE INJURED. MY TWO WITNESSES THE SUPPORT TODAY ARE DAISY LOPEZ MEMBER OF THE GRAYTON DAY. LABOR CENTER AND MEGAN ORTIZ EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF IN DEPTH SCCA.

WORKERS COALITION. WORKERS ARE MAKING IN THE AND WOMEN OF COLOR. I KNOW HISTORICALLY EXT. FROM THE MOST BASIC LABOR PROTECTIONS EVEN WHEN USERS ARE ROOTED IN THE LEGACY OF SLAVERY AND THE DISENFRANCHISEMENT OF BLACK WORKERS FROM RIGHT IN THIS COUNTRY. IN THE LAST DECADE CALIFORNIANS HAVE SOUGHT TO CORRECT THESE INJUSTICES AND RECOGNIZE THE VALUE OF THE OF DOMESTIC WORK. ALONG WITH OTHER STATES CALIFORNIA HAS LED THE EXPANSION OF WORKPLACE PROTECTIONS TO DEFEAT THE FUNCTIONAL WORKFORCE AND TODAY. WE ARE ONE OF THE LAST VESTIGES OF SYSTEMATIC RACISM BY REMOVING THE HOUSEHOLD DOMESTIC SERVICE EXCLUSION FROM CALIFORNIA'S HEALTH AND SAFETY LAW. MORE THAN EVER I THINK WE'RE MUST BE PART. ALL OTHER EMPLOYEES. DURING THE PANDEMIC AND WITH ANOTHER WILDFIRE SEASON ALWAYS APPROACHING THEY CONTINUED TO CARE FOR OUR HOMES AND LOVED ONES AT THE FRONT WORK. AT HOME. MANNING AND HOW QUICKLY. WE THAT IT IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES COLOR THAT HAVE BEEN DEFERRED. DOESN'T BY THE TIME. AND YET. THE GOVERNOR'S VETO LAST YEAR THE WORKERS REMAIN THE ONLY EMPLOYEES EXCLUDED FROM THE RIGHT.

SENATOR REID SO I CENTER LAYERED ON CINDER LAYERED I CENTER NEWMAN HI CENTER NEWMAN HIGH- THAT. VOTE IS FOUR TO ONE. THE BILL OUT. THANK YOU SEE TO ROSSELL WORD. ON OUR AGENDA WOULD BE BEST SIX THIRTY NINE YOU MAY PRESENT ON THE BILL THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS THIS BILL ENSURES THAT WORKERS WITH DISABILITIES CANNOT BE PAID LESS THAN MINIMUM WAGE SINCE THE NINETEEN THIRTIES THE STATE HAS BEEN ABLE TO PAY WORKERS WITH DISABILITIES LESS THAN MINIMUM WAGE THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF WHAT'S CALLED FOURTEEN C. CERTIFICATES. UNDER THE FAIR LABOR STANDARDS ACT THIS PROGRAM WAS ESTABLISHED UNDER THE ROOSEVELT ADMINISTRATION. WORLD WAR TWO VETERANS WHO DEVELOPED PHYSICAL AND MENTAL DISABILITIES FROM COMBAT. CAME HOME FROM ABROAD AND STRUGGLE TO FIND EMPLOYMENT IN AMERICA'S MANUFACTURING ECONOMY SINCE WORKERS WITH DISABILITIES WERE PERCEIVED TO BE LESS EFFICIENT. IN MANUFACTURING JOBS AND THEIR PEERS THESE FOURTEEN C. CERTIFICATES ALLOWED EMPLOYERS TO PAY WORKERS WITH DISABILITIES LESS THAN ALL OTHER WORKERS. OVER TIME FOURTEEN SEED CERTIFICATES OFFERED EMPLOYERS A POOL OF CHEAP LABOUR FOR MENIAL REDUNDANT TASKS OFTEN BY WORKERS WITH INTELLECTUAL OR DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES IN SEGREGATED SETTINGS ALSO KNOWN AS SHELTERED WORKSHOPS. AS OF OCTOBER TWENTY TWENTY THEY WERE EIGHTY ONE FOURTEEN C. CERTIFICATE HOLDERS IN CALIFORNIA. FIFTY SEVEN OF THE EIGHTY ONE HAVE VENDOR AGREEMENTS WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF REHABILITATION TO PROVIDE SERVICES AND SUPPORT. FOR INDIVIDUALS SEEKING WHAT'S CALLED COMPETITIVE INTEGRATED EMPLOYMENT. FIVE YEARS AGO THEY WERE TWENTY TWO THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS WORKING IN SUB MINIMUM WAGE ENVIRONMENT. THE NUMBER IS NOW TWELVE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED SIXTY NINE. THE NUMBER FOURTEEN C. CERTIFICATE HOLDERS ALSO CONTINUES TO DECREASE FROM ONE HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE YEARS AGO TO EIGHTY ONE AS OF OCTOBER TWENTY TWENTY SO EVEN AS CALIFORNIA PRIDES ITSELF IN LEADING THE COUNTRY WITH OUR FIFTEEN DOLLAR MINIMUM WAGE. THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS WITH DISABILITIES ARE STILL BEING EXPLOITED IN THE SEGREGATED SETTINGS OFTEN FOR LESS THAN TWO DOLLARS PER HOUR. SEGREGATE EMPLOYMENT IS ANTITHETICAL TO OUR VALUES AS A STATE. AND REINFORCES THE FALSE NOTION THAT PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES ARE UNABLE TO BE INTEGRATED IN SOCIETY AND ARE INCAPABLE OF PRODUCING LABOR OF VALUE. SB SIX THIRTY NINE PROHIBITS THE ISSUANCE OF NEW. CERTIFICATES BY JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY TWO. AND DEVELOPS A PHASE OUT PLAN FOR CURRENT CERTIFICATE HOLDERS. TO ENSURE A PATH TO COMPETITIVE INTEGRATED EMPLOYMENT. BY TWENTY TWENTY FOUR THIS BILL WOULD END THE PRACTICE OF SEGREGATED SUB MINIMUM WAGE EMPLOYMENT ENTIRELY. THIS IS NOT A PARTISAN MEASURE IT IS A MEASURE TO OFFER DIGNITY TO THOSE WORKERS WITH DISABILITIES. AND INSURERS BY OFFERING THEM TO THE SAME UP EARNED BY OFFERING THEM THE SAME WAGES AND AS THEIR PEERS IF ENACTED CALIFORNIA WILL FOLLOW. THE STATE OF ALASKA CONNECTICUT MARYLAND NEVADA NEW HAMPSHIRE NEW YORK OREGON RHODE ISLAND TEXAS AND WASHINGTON. IN PROHIBITING SUB MINIMUM WAGE EMPLOYMENT OR SHELTERED WORKSHOPS. SET A MINIMUM WAGE IS AN ARCHAIC RELIC OF THE NINETEEN THIRTIES IT DATES TO A TIME WHEN CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES WERE DENIED AN EDUCATION AND BEFORE CIVIL RIGHTS LEGISLATION SUCH AS THE- AMERICANS WITH DISABILITY ACT. IT IS BEYOND TIME FOR CALIFORNIA AND THIS PRACTICE I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. WE HAVE A- VOTE WITNESSES TODAY GREGORY CAN'T KRAMER ON BEHALF OF DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA. JACKIE ARMSTRONG A FORMER SUB MINIMUM WAGE EMPLOYEE AND ERIN CARUTHERS OF THE STATE COUNCIL ON DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. AB AVAILABLE TO ANSWER TECHNICAL QUESTIONS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU WERE MISTER KRAMER YOU- PREPARED TO PROCEED. I AM YES MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU PLEASE PROCEED WITH. OKAY MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS GREGORY KRAMER ON BEHALF OF DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA WILL PROBABLY CO SPONSORED SENATE BILL SIX THIRTY NINE WHAT THE STATE COUNCIL ON DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES AND COMMITTEE AUTHOR FOR HER WORK TO END THE EXPLODED A PRACTICE OF PAYING PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES LEG BY MINIMUM WAGE. MEASURES LONG OVERDUE FOR EIGHT DECADES OF PRACTICE HAS REINFORCED A FALSE ASSUMPTION THAT PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES ARE LESS CAPABLE OF FULL EMPLOYMENT THAN PEOPLE WITHOUT DISABILITIES. IT IS ALSO IN DIRECT CONFLICT WITH THE STATE AND NATIONAL TRENDS AT ALL POINTS IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION. IN RECENT YEARS FOR STATES HAVE PROHIBITED THE SUB MINIMUM WAGES ALL TOGETHER ANOTHER FOREIGN AFFAIRS OUT PROCESS AND MANY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE DONE THE SAME THE MORE MORE PROVIDERS EVERY DAY ARE CHOOSING TO END THEIR RELIANCE ON THESE. OUTDATED AND DISCRIMINATORY PRACTICES. SHOULD BE NO SURPRISE DECADES OF RESEARCH DEMONSTRATE THAT PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES CAN WITH THE RIGHT SUPPORT. SIX SEED AND COMPETITIVE INTEGRATED EMPLOYMENT HOWEVER ALIGNING CALIFORNIA STATE AND NATIONAL TRENDS IS NOT ENOUGH. WE CAN DO BETTER. THIS IS WHY SENATE BILL SIX THIRTY NINE CALLS FOR STATE AGENCIES COMMUNITY LEADERS AND STAKEHOLDERS TO COME TOGETHER TO DEVELOP A PLAN THAT NOT ONLY PHASES OUT THE ABILITY FOR PROVIDERS TO PAY PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES WHAT THE MINIMUM WAGE. IT ALSO REQUIRES THE IDENTIFICATION OF RESOURCES AND FUNDING STREAMS THAT WILL CREATE PATHWAYS TO EMPLOYMENT FOR INDIVIDUALS AND SUB MINIMUM WAGE SETTINGS. BUT IT'S TIME FOR CALIFORNIA TO PROVIDE PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES EQUAL PROTECTION UNDER THE LAW. AND THAT'S A MINIMUM WAGE WILL CALL IN ADVANCE THE SPIRIT OF THE EIGHTY EIGHT. THE BILL COULD COURTED BY A BROAD COALITION OF DISABILITY GROUPS LABOR UNIONS AND FORMER FOURTEEN C. PROVIDERS. AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR MY ABOUT. WHO YOU MISTER CREE- THE CHECK ARMSTRONG FOR YOU A BILL TO TEST. YES I AM PLEASE EVERYONE HE ME YES WE CAN PROCEED. I AM JACKIE ARMSTRONG FROM ROSEVILLE CALIFORNIA AND I'M ON THE AUTISM SPECTRUM. I WORKED IN A SHELTERED WORKSHOP FOR SEVEN YEARS MY FIRST DANCE WORKSHOP I WAS GOING NUTS AND BOLTS TOGETHER I ASKED SOMEONE NEXT TO ME WHAT ARE WE DOING AND THE PERSONS THAT TRAINING AND I GUESS TRAINING IS WHERE YOU DON'T GET PAID FOR THE WHOLE DAY BECAUSE THERE'S NO WORK. NOW EVENTUALLY I GOT PROMOTED TO LIKE TONICS WHERE I PUT MEDICAL DEVICES TOGETHER AND IT WAS A FIFTEEN STEP PROCESS AND THEN YOU WOULD- PUT ALL THE PARTS TOGETHER. A MEDICAL. ALTOGETHER SURE IN THE BOARD ALL. AND THEN. SKINNER GOAL ALL THE IN THE ON THE CAN. NOW AT THE TOP. MINIMUM WAGE WAS EIGHT DOLLARS AN HOUR AND BECAUSE I AM- ON THE SPECTRUM I'M ALSO VERY METICULOUS DETAIL ORIENTED I TEND TO GO SLOWER THAN MY PEERS- AND ALL THEY READ WAS ON THAT I WAS GOING SLOWER THAN EVERYBODY ELSE SO. I GOT PAID FIVE DOLLARS AN HOUR FOR BASICALLY WHAT AT WHAT MY NONDISABLED PIERRE WAS MAKE MAKING- ABOUT THREE TIMES AS MUCH AS I WAS INCLUDING BENEFITS AND VACATION PAY AND ALL THAT. THE OTHER PIECES THAT I WAS BULLIED QUITE A BIT FROM BY- COWORKERS WITHOUT DISABILITIES WHO WOULD ACTUALLY MAKE THE OTHER DISABLED PEOPLE. CALLING ME BECAUSE THEY WERE I GUESS A LITTLE BIT INTIMIDATED BY HOW. AWESOME I MIGHT BE SO I EVENTUALLY DEVELOPED A BIT OF A PHOBIA OF PEOPLE WITHOUT DISABILITIES TO THE POINT WHERE I A- STOPPED ON REACHING OUT TO ANYBODY OUTSIDE OF MY FAMILY AND I WAS ACTUALLY RATHER. AFRAID OF PEOPLE AND MY I WOULD LOOK IN THE MIRROR AND I SEE A VERY SMALL PERSON NOT A VERY BIG PERSON AS WELL SO. I DIDN'T SEE MYSELF AS WORTHY OF WORKING BASICALLY ARMS. THEN TWO SIXTEEN I GOT INTO SUPPORTED EMPLOYMENT AND I GOT A JOB WHERE I WORK AT A MUNICIPAL DISTRICT I MAKE ABOUT FIVE TIMES AS MUCH AS I DO NOW OR AS I DID WHEN I WAS AT THE WORKSHOP. AND MY NOBODY BULLIES ME THAT'S FOR SURE AND I LOVE. EVERY MOMENT THAT I AM THERE AND I. FEEL VALUED AND- I IF THERE'S NO WORK COMING IN I STILL GET PAID SO THAT'S THE MOST WONDERFUL PART- THANK YOU WHEN I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST DENIED VOTE. THREE Q.

OKAY THANK YOU- MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THERE'S NOT A WEED OPPOSITION WITNESSES ARE CORRECT. THERE IS A PLEASE COME FORWARD IF YOU'RE HERE TO SPEAK UP IN OPPOSITION TO SENATE BILL SIX THIRTY NINE. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS SAID CARL LONDON HERE REPRESENTING TODAY. THE ALLIANCE SUPPORTING PEOPLE WITH I. D. D. THIS IS A STATEWIDE ORGANIZATION OF. COMMUNITY BASED AGENCIES THAT SERVE THE- POPULATION CALIFORNIANS WITH IDEA ON A DAILY BASIS. WE'RE NOT OPPOSED TO THIS POINT WE DO HAVE SOME DEEP CONCERNS WANT TO BRING YOUR ATTENTION SOME VERY REAL PRAGMATIC ISSUES THAT- WE SHOULD ALL BE CONSIDERING OR LOOKING AT THIS POLICY. THE BILL AS A NUMBER OF FINE POINTS IN IT WE SUPPORT MANY OF THE PROVISIONS OF THE BILL WHAT WE DON'T SUPPORT AND WE THINK NEEDS TO BE REWORKED VERY CAREFULLY. IS THE TIMELINE THE CENTER DRAWS WAS PLACED IN THIS BILL AND I WANT TO BACK UP FOR SECOND EXPLAIN FOURTEEN SEE A LITTLE BIT THE CONTEXT. OF HOW THIS IS USED IN CALIFORNIA TO CREATE OPPORTUNITIES EVERYONE HERE SHOULD UNDERSTAND. THAT NOBODY IN THIS POPULATION GETS A NEW APPOINTMENT SITUATION UNLESS IT GOES THROUGH THEIR INDIVIDUALIZED PROGRAM. THAT THEY DEVELOP IN CONCERT WITH THE REGIONAL CENTER UNDER THE LANHAM ACT THE STATE'S LAMIN ACT YOU DO NOT END UP IN A FOURTEEN C. EMPLOYMENT SITUATION UNLESS IT'S BY YOUR CHOICE. SO WHEN WE THINK OF PEOPLE WHO WERE STABBED ALLEGEDLY STUCK IN THE SITUATIONS THEY'RE CHOOSING TO BE AND THAT THE STATE HAS DONE AN AWFUL LOT. TO TRY TO GET THAT THE ISSUE OF EMPLOYMENT FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES TO CREATE MINIMUM WAGE OR HIGHER JOBS TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN THIS LEGISLATURE PASSED. A PROVISION THAT CALLED THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND EMPLOYMENT FIRST STATE FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES THEN WE DEVELOP COMPETITIVE INTEGRATED EMPLOYMENT ANY PAID INTERNSHIP PROGRAM. GUESS WHAT DURING THE TIME OF THAT AND THAT DATES BACK TO REPORT BY THE DEPARTMENT WHICH AT THE TIME SHOWED OUR STATE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE AT 86% FOR THIS POPULATION GUESS WHAT IT IS TODAY AFTER ALL THOSE EFFORTS OF THE LAST. SIX YEARS STILL 86% WE ONLY HAVE 40% WE HAVE TO DO BETTER. THE REALITY HERE IS THE AT. PEOPLE TO THIS BECAUSE IT CREATES AN A FOR THEM TO GET OUT IN THE COMMUNITY AND TO WORK AND BEGIN TO JOIN THE WORKFORCE IF YOU'RE A PERSON WITH A DISABILITY INTERNAL HOME OR MOM GOES TO WORK DAD GOES TO WORK YOU ALSO THINK ABOUT GOING TO WORK AND SO AS YOU DEVELOP YOUR PLAN YOU LOOK AT WORTH OPPORTUNITIES THROUGHOUT ALL OF YOUR DISTRICTS THERE ARE PROGRAMS TODAY THAT SERVE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE A SENATOR BRONSON CORRECTLY NOTED IF THIS BILL GOES THROUGH IN TWO YEARS. EVERY ONE OF THOSE FOURTEEN THOUSAND PEOPLE WERE EMPLOYED WE'LL HAVE TO FIND A MINIMUM WAGE OR HIGHER JOB OR BE OUT OF WORK AND OUT OF THE WORK THAT THEY CHOSE THAT'S NOT AN APPROPRIATE RESPONSE WELL WE'VE GOT A LOOK AT AND WHAT IS CORRECT IN THIS BILL OR DEVELOPING STRATEGIES HAVING THE DISCUSSIONS AND WE OUGHT TO BE DOING THINGS LIKE REACHING OUT TO THE EMPLOYER COMMUNITY TO ASK THEM WHAT IT IS THAT THEY CAN DO TO HELP WITH THIS POPULATION. LET'S HAVE A SUMMIT WITH THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER THE GROCERS THE RESTAURANTS THE RETAILERS THE MANUFACTURERS AND ASKED THEM TO JOIN US IN THIS EFFORT BEFORE WE JUST SHUT DOWN THE EXISTING WORKING OPPORTUNITIES THAT PEOPLE OUT TODAY HI I URGE YOU I KNOW THIS BILLS PROBABLY GONNA PASSED TODAY THIS CONVERSATIONS GOTTA GO A LOT DEEPER THAN THE SLOGAN OF WHETHER OR NOT PEOPLE ARE MAKING MINIMUM WAGE OR HIGHER IN THE STATE THERE IS MUCH MORE COMPLEXITY TO IT THAT IS BEING REPRESENTED AND I URGE YOU TO TAKE A VERY CLOSE LOOK AT THIS I KNOW IT'S GOING TO GO TO THE HUMAN SERVICES COMMITTEE. WILL HAVE A MORE FULLER DISCUSSION THERE BUT THIS BILL IS NOT EXACTLY WHAT'S BEING REPRESENTED TODAY NOBODY ENDS UP IN THESE JOBS UNLESS IT'S BY THEIR CHOICE IT IS DEVELOPED THROUGH AN IPP THAT GOES TO THE REGIONAL CENTER SYSTEM SO EVERY PERSON THAT IS IN THAT SITUATION TODAY HASN'T APPROVED PROGRAM FOR EXACTLY THAT SITUATION AND THAT'S WHAT THE REGIONAL CENTER HAS GONE OUT TO HELP THEM BY WE'VE GOT A LOOK AT THAT MUCH. MORE CAREFULLY THAN WHAT'S BEING REPRESENTED AT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH YOU'RE- THANK YOU FOR COMMENTS OF ANYONE ELSE N THE CAN ROOM WISHES. OP TO SB SIX NINE. THE C.

ABIDE BY THE RULES SO LIMIT YOUR COMMENTS ESPECIALLY ON THE TELECONFERENCE. WANTING TO YOUR NAME. AFFILIATION POSITION THANK YOU BACK TO. THE DAIS HERE IN THE COMMITTEE ANYONE WISHING TO SPEAK ON SB SIX THIRTY NINE FROM THE DAIS. CENTER NEWMAN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- I WAS ACTUALLY QUITE MOVED BY THE FOR BY THE COLLAR FOR THE WITNESS IN SUPPORT BUT- IT SHOULD TO RUSSIA IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND RESPONDING TO THE CONCERN WHICH WAS ARTICULATED WELL BY MR LONDON AND OTHERS ABOUT THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE CONSEQUENCES POTENTIALLY OF THIS LEGISLATION PARTICULAR TIMELINE IMPLICATIONS- AND THE POSSIBLE THAT WE MIGHT. B. CLOSING PATHWAYS- IN SOME WAYS FOR DISABLED PEOPLE INSTEAD OF EXPANDING THEM. THANK YOU MISTER SENATOR- I THINK RATHER ME MAYBE I'LL HAVE- MISTER CARRUTHERS OF THE STATE COUNCIL ON DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES ANSWERED THAT WITH MORE EXPERTISE. THIS RECRUITERS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU OUT THERE- THERE. FOLLOW CHALLENGES TO THIS BILL UNFORTUNATELY THE CHALLENGES DON'T SPEAK PLUS FAVORABLY OF CHARTER WORKSHOPS SO THE ECONOMIC IMPLICATIONS OF THAT THE RESEARCH SHOWS THAT THEIR COUNTER INDICATIVE. OF ACTUALLY GETTING EMPLOYMENT SO THERE ONE WAY TRAPS YOU GO WHEN YOU ACTUALLY DON'T GET THE TRAINING YOU NEED YOU DON'T GET THE SKILLS YOU NEED YOU'RE LESS LIKELY TO GET A JOB OUTSIDE OF IT I'M BECAUSE THEY ARE PAYING RATES THAT ARE LOWER THEY'RE KEEPING PEOPLE IN POVERTY. WE HAVE A LOT OF COMPASSION FOR THE LEGACY SERVICES- WE HAVE MUCH MORE COMPASSIONATE PEOPLE RECEIVED. AT LEAST MINIMUM WAGE. FOR THE DIGNITY OF THEIR WORK. SO IT SHOULD I HAVE TO ASK HIM IS THE A SCENARIO WHERE WE CONSIDERED ONE WHERE- A FOURTEEN C. WORKER WOULD BE ASSURED OF MINIMUM WAGE AND BETTER AND WE COULD STILL PROVIDE THOSE PATHWAYS. THE STATE OF THE A LOT OF INVESTMENT- TOWARDS THOSE PATHWAYS. FOR THE LAST FEW YEARS THEY HAVE WORKED ON THE BLUEPRINT FOR COMPETITIVE INTEGRATED EMPLOYMENT THAT'S A COLLABORATIVE PROJECT BETWEEN THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. WE HAVE AN DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES ADDITIONALLY THE STATE HAS ISSUED. SINCE FISCAL YEAR SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN. FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS IN GRANTS. THIS IS AN ONGOING A CORPORATION. FOR A SERVICES THAT ARE SERVING PEOPLE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES TO. MODERNIZE TO UPDATE. THIS GRANT SOURCE CONTINUES ON IN THE NEWS ACCORDING TO PROVIDERS CAN. PRODUCE GRANTS TO UPDATE. THEIR THEIR SERVICES. THANK YOU IN TERMS ICE MISTER LONDON IS A BIT COULD WE GET A QUICK WRIST FROM HIM AS WELL IF YOU WOULD LIKE A TWO TWO DIRECT A QUESTION TO HIM COOL IT OUR MISSION ON IF YOU WOULD NOT RECEIVE. ST YEAH- THANK YOU MISTER- CENTER NEW AND THE TO USE THAT IN OF THE FUNDING THAT MR CROTHERS A SIGHTING WE STILL HAVE RECEIVED NO BUMP IN THE STATE OF ALL. INCREASE IN THE NUMBERS. OF PEOPLE IN THE PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE. GETTING MINIMUM WAGE HIGHER OF. IT JUST DEMONSTRATES WHAT A CHALLENGE IT IS TO GET TO THAT LEVEL. NOW WE HAVE PROPOSED SOME THINGS. CREATIVELY IN THE PAST FOR EXAMPLE AN IDEA YOU COULD DO. IS LET THE IMPORT EMPLOYER PAY. FOR THE FOURTEEN C. PORTION OF THE PERSON'S WAGE. THAT YOU WOULD OTHERWISE MEASURE AND STILL GO THROUGH THE PROCESS ALLOWED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. AND THEN SUBSIDIZE THE REST SOMEHOW. WE PROPOSED A TAX CREDIT TO PASS WITHOUT IT WAS REJECTED BY THE LEGISLATURE BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO LOWER. THE PROP NINETY BASE FUNDING WE GET SCORED. SO ORGANIZED LABOR OPPOSES THAT- YOU'D HAVE TO TALK ABOUT A MASSIVE SUBSIDIZATION IN ORDER TO JUMP SOME OF THESE PEOPLE. BASED ON THEIR PRODUCTIVITY. INTO A MINIMUM WAGE OR HIGHER JOB OR- YOU'RE SENDING THE MESSAGE UNDER THIS BILL. THAT THEY SIMPLY CANNOT WORK IN THE WORKPLACE THAT. BECAUSE THEY DON'T MEET. MINIMUM WAGE PRODUCTIVITY WHICH EMPLOYERS. USUALLY WANT AS PART OF THEIR BOTTOM LINE. UNLESS YOU SUBSIDIZE THAT THEY'RE GOING TO LOSE OUT. AND THE DATA MR CROWTHER'S REFERS TO OVER OVER AGAIN. WHAT THEY ARE TELLING YOU ARE DEMONSTRATING AT THAT DATA. IS HOW MANY OF THOSE PEOPLE THAT WE SUBSIDIZE IN THOSE PROGRAMS. CONTINUE ON IN THE JOB THAT THEY HAVE INTO THE FUTURE UNTIL WE KNOW THAT. IT'S VERY PREMATURE. TO SLAM THE DOOR ON PEOPLE WHO ARE CURRENTLY WORKING. CHOSEN TO DO THAT AND HAVE NO HOPE TO GET INTO THE OTHER. STYLE JOB THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE. ALL WE'RE SAYING IS THAT SHE'S SHE'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT ON THAT. ROAD IS RUBBISH AMENDMENTS BUT THE TIMELINE BROUGH WE NORMALLY ALLOW FIVE MINUTES TOTAL FOR A WITNESS WE ARE NEW- A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME TO RESPOND TO A QUESTION DIRECTLY. IF YOU'RE STARTING OFF ON A TANGENT SO. YEAH PLEASE WRAP UP THANK YOU ALL I'D SAY IS THAT THE TIMELINE IN THIS BILL IS JUST COMPLETELY UNREALISTIC GIVEN THE GOALS THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER PATIENT THANK YOU MISTER PRIME AND I GUESS I WOULD HOPE THAT THESE TWO GOALS. ARE NOT MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE AND THE AUTHOR AND I KNOW THE AUTHOR- IS MORE THAN WILLING. TO LOOK AT SCENARIOS THAT MIGHT ALLOW FOR A MORE GRAYSON. TODAY YOU. ANYTHING- ALSO FROM OF CENTER ALERT I- I WAS GOING TO GO ASSUME PATH THIS THE IS SENT NEWMAN AND IT'S JUST AND I TALKED TO THE- AUTHORED VERY BRIEFLY AND INFORMALLY BEFORE THE HEARING JUST BECAUSE- I HAD EXPERIENCE WITH THESE PROGRAMS IN JURASSIC TIMES AHEAD AND IT WAS ALWAYS AN ISSUE OF. IF YOU MOVE TO MINIMUM WAGE YOU HAD TO HAVE SOME EXTRA MONEY. TO DO IT AND THURSDAY'S ANCILLARY ISSUES THAT OUR MONETARY IS THE AMOUNT OF TIME PEOPLE SPENDING IS ON AMOUNT OF TIME OF SOCIALIZATION. AND THE SOCIALIZATION HAS VALUE IN ADDITION TO THE WAGE. AND F. AND I KNOW THAT MISTER LONDON. AHA BOB JUST AS A PERSONAL CONNECTION TO THIS HE ISN'T NECESSARILY STANDING UP FOR CLIENT IT'S PERSONAL EXPERIENCE AND SO I'M PREPARED BECAUSE I THINK THAT THE AUTHOR IS IN THE RIGHT PLACE FOR FORCING THE ISSUE DECISION NEEDS TO BE ENFORCED AND IT'S THE RIGHT DIRECTION BUT I THINK THERE ARE STILL SOME CONVERSATIONS TO BE HAD BECAUSE FOR TURNS OUT THAT WE NEED TO BUDGETARY WE ADD SOME MONEY TO MAKE SURE THIS WORKS OR NOT. I JUST KNOW THAT. OUR WHEN I WAS RESOURCES SECRETARY WE HAD CONSERVATION CORPS MEMBERS AT WORK MAKING MINIMUM WAGE AND- THERE WAS A PERIOD OF TIME WHERE THE ADMINISTRATION MIGHT OWN ADMINISTRATION WAS NOT GOING TO GIVE US EXTRA MONEY SO. IN ORDER TO INCREASE THE WAGE WE'RE GOING TO CUT HOURS OF THE NUMBER FOR THE NUMBER OF CORPS MEMBERS AND IN THE END. SOME OF US BLUDGEONED TO THEM INTO PUTTING THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF MONEY AND TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE GOT THE MINIMUM WAGE THEY DESERVED. AND IT DIDN'T DISADVANTAGED THEM IT WASN'T A FALSE RIGHTS- TO GET IT AND SO I DON'T KNOW WHEN ENOUGH TO KNOW IF THERE'S A SIMILAR QUESTION HERE BUT IF THERE IS- I WOULD SUPPORT PASSING THE BILL I'M TRYING TO ADDRESS THAT QUESTION. AND M. R. WOULD JUST HOPE THAT THERE'S CONVERSATIONS IF THE TIME ON JUST TWO SHORT BECAUSE SOME OF THESE ISSUES AREN'T ADDRESSED AT THAT. YOU KNOW BE TALKED ABOUT THE DEATH OUR DAHLE IS A PERSON OF GOOD FAITH. AND INCREDIBLE INTELLIGENCE I'M GOING TO VOTE TO MOVE THE BILL ALONG AND JUST. I THINK WE JUST NEED TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE TESTIMONY THAT WAS GIVEN TO. THE MOTION SENATOR THE BILL. SOON ARE ALSO WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. M. YOU KNOW I AM I KNOW THAT WE MYSELF AND OUR ADVOCATES OF COURSE WOULD LISTEN TO ANYTHING BECAUSE WE'RE NOT ABOUT PUTTING PEOPLE OUT OF WORK- BUT WE DO KNOW THAT- WE BELIEVE THAT THE LENGTH OF TIME THAT'S BEEN INCORPORATED HERE. YOU KNOW CLOSE TO THREE YEARS THAT THAT SHOULD BE ENOUGH TO FIGURE OUT THE PHASING OUT BUT WILL BE GLAD TO GO BACK AND REVISIT THE REVISIT THE ISSUE SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK RELIABLE. OKAY SO WE OVER A MOTION BY SENATOR LAYERED- AND WILL FIRST ROLL CALL VOTE THIS TIME. THE MOTION IS TO PASS BUT FIRST BE REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON HUMAN SERVICES SENATOR CORTESE HI AND THE COURT HAS THE HIGHEST SENATOR- CHOKE. PASSENGER OCHO BOOK NOT VOTE IN SENATOR ALSO. SENATOR DRAWS- ON SENATOR LAYERED CENTER LAYERED HI SENATOR NEWMAN ALL RIGHT SENATOR NEWMAN HI- THAT MEASURE IS FOUR TO ONE. THE THANK YOU BILLS OF. WELL FOUR ZERO FOUR EXCUSE ME FOUR ZERO. THANK YOU FOR CLARIFYING MATH. SENATOR DRAWS A WILL MOVE NOW TO YOUR BILL SENATE BILL SIX SEVENTY FOUR- YOU MAY PRESENT AT THIS TIME. OKAY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR M. I. A. PROMISE IT. WHERE DID THE- WITH I REALLY YOUR PATIENCE IN TIME AND- HELLO ME TO GO FORWARD WITH THIS- AND THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR YOUR ENGAGEMENT ON ON THIS BILL OR YOUR STAFF HAS BEEN. VERY THOUGHTFUL AND DETAILED IN THEIR ANALYSIS AND- WE'VE LOOKED AT THE CONSIDERATIONS AND THEN ANALYSIS I WILL WORK HARD TO CONTINUE TO ADDRESS EACH OF THOSE POINTS. AND ALSO TO CONTINUE TO ENGAGE WITH STAKEHOLDERS- SB SIX SEVENTY FOUR WILL ENSURE THAT THE BENEFITS OF THE TRANSITION TO CLEAN TRANSPORTATION. WILL HELP CALIFORNIA'S MOST MARGINALIZED PEOPLE AND ALL WORKING FAMILIES. THIS BILL FOCUSES ON CREATING QUALITY CLIMATE RESILIENT JOBS WITH OUR TRANSPORTATION DOLLARS. THERE WAS A REPORT AB THREE NINETY EIGHT UP AB THREE NINETY A REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE- CALLED PUTTING CALIFORNIA ON THE HIGH ROAD A JOBS JOBS AND CLIMATE ACTION PLAN. AND IS PART OF IT SAID IF I MAY MISTER CHAIR- IT SAID QUOTE CALIFORNIA'S TRANSPORTATION SECTOR IS THE STATE'S LARGEST SOURCE OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS ACCOUNTING 439% OF THE STATEWIDE TOTAL. IS ALSO THE LARGEST SOURCE OF CRITERIA AIR POLLUTANTS AND TOXIC DIESEL PARTICULATE MATTER EMISSIONS IN THE STATE. AND AT THE SAME TIME IT THE TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM. UNDERPINS OUR ECONOMY- TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF GOODS ARE MOVED EACH YEAR- AND- SUPPORT MORE THAN FIVE MILLION JOBS AND OF COURSE WE HAVE OUR PASSENGER VEHICLES UP PARTNERSHIPS WITH BUSINESS CAN LEAD TO PROSPERITY FOR EVERYONE. AND THIS BILL WOULD ENACT THE CALIFORNIA JOBS PLAN ACT TO CREATE A CLEAR PARTNERSHIP WITH THE GUM BENEFIT THE COMPANIES WHO ARE BENEFITING FROM OUR PUBLICLY FUNDED TRANSPORTATION CONTRACTS AND SUBSIDIES AND MAKE IT A TRANSPARENT TO THE TAXPAYERS. OF THE JOBS PLAN REFERS TO A COMPONENT OF AN APPLICATION AN APPLICANT SUBMITS IT FOR COVERED PUBLIC CONTRACTS SPECIFIES THE MINIMUM NUMBER OF JOBS PROPOSED WAGES BENEFITS INVESTMENT IN TRAINING AND TARGETED HIRING PLANS ESPECIALLY FOR DISPLACED WORKERS AND INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE HISTORICALLY BEEN EXCLUDED. BUT OUR JOBS PLAN COMPONENT WILL NOT REQUIRE ANY NEW COMMITMENTS OTHER THAN THOSE ALREADY REQUIRED BY RELEVANT FEDERAL STATE AND LOCAL LAWS. THE- THEY SHALLOW- ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATION TO APPLICANTS NOT THAT THE PLAN WILL BE WEIGHTED HIGHER THAN OTHER SECTIONS. REQUIRED INFORMATION INCLUDES AGAIN THE NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES THE NUMBER OF JOBS FOR DISPLACED WORKERS- PROPOSED WAGES AND BENEFITS OF THE NEW ADMINISTRATION FEDERAL MINISTRATION HAS BEEN CLEAR THAT PUBLIC DOLLARS SHOULD CREATE COMMUNITY BENEFITS. AND HIS EXECUTIVE ORDER PRESIDENT BY HIS EXECUTIVE ORDER ON KIND CLIMATE IMPLEMENTS IMPLEMENTS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN FEDERAL POLICY A PAIRING OF URGENT ISSUES OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. THE CREATION OF NEW GOOD JOBS AND OF COURSE- PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN HAVE BEEN HEAVILY POLLUTED FIVE COMMUNITIES- WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO WORK TOGETHER TO REALIZE THE GOALS OF OUR OWN CALIFORNIA FUTURE WORK COMMISSION. WHICH CALLS FOR A NEW SOCIAL COMPACT FOR WORK AND WORKERS- WE NEED CLEAR ACCOUNTABILITY FOR COMMITMENTS TO JOB CREATE A CREATION AND ACCESS TO THAT INFORMATION FROM THE PUBLIC- SO THIS ACT WILL MOVE STATE TRIBES PROTECTION FUNDS. TO GOOD JOBS AND SURE PROACTIVE EFFORT TO GIVE THOSE JOBS TO WHEN MEN AND WOMEN WHO HAVE HAD BEEN. EXCLUDED HISTORICALLY- TODAY WE HAVE MELANIE TO MELA PRASAD FROM JOBS TO MOVE AMERICA AS A WITNESS TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU SENATOR MITCH PRASAD OR YOU PREPARED TO SPEAK AT THIS TIME. THE CANON MCAFEE PLEASE RECEIVED. PARENTS MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE NEGATIVE NOMINAL PROFOUND AND I IN THE CALIFORNIA DIRECTOR AND JOHN MERICA NATIONAL STRATEGIC RESEARCH AND POLICY CENTER DEDICATED TO ENSURING THAT PUBLIC DOLLARS ARE SPENT IN A WAY THAT. THE PUBLIC AT. I'M HERE TO INVOICE STRONG SUPPORT FOR AT SEVEN POINT BUT- JOB. EACH YEAR IN AND ON. MOMENT OF CONVERGING. FIVE GETTING ON. SYMPATHETIC AS CLIMATE CHANGE. OR TO START OURSELVES OUT OF THE- YOU NEED STOCKHOLM INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS THAT FINAL PAYMENT A CLASS MULTIPLE ISSUES AB ONE. I THINK SIX SEVEN BORN IS ONE ACTUALLY. BY BEING PART ABOUT HOW WE INVEST THE HARD EARNED TAX DOLLARS IN TRAFFIC. I THINK HERE BY THE PEOPLE OF THIS STATE WE CAN IN BACK IN CLIMATE EIGHT TRANSPORTATION WHILE CREATING GOOD MIDDLE CLASS CAREER PATHWAYS FOR PEOPLE WHO AND I'M OUT. I SENATOR TORONTO ALREADY DONE A VERY GOOD JOB OF EXPLAINING WHAT THE CALIFORNIA JOBS AND THAT. I'D LIKE TO TAKE A MOMENT TO TALK ABOUT WHAT THE CALIFORNIA JOB DOES NOT DEAL. THE CALIFORNIA JOB TRAINING IS NOT PLACE AN UNDUE BURDEN ON. IT DOES NOT TAKE PRIORITY OVER AT CENTRAL ELEMENT LIKE ASPHERIC. NOT QUITE LIKE THE PRICE OF BAD ARCHETYPAL COMPETITION AND IT DOES NOT REQUIRE ANY MINIMUM COMMITMENT. THE CALIFORNIA DOT. BORN THE ONLY REQUIREMENT IS THAT IT BE SOLD OUT AND THAT YOU ARE QUITE ON IT ONLY. BACKSET IT RECOGNIZING THAT WHEN COMPANIES PAY FAMILY SUSTAINING WAGES AND CREATE MIDDLE CLASS CAREER PATH FOR INDIVIDUAL IN BARRIERS TO EMPLOYMENT IT HAS A VERY REAL POSITIVE IMPACT ON THE ECONOMY AND THAT NEEDS TO BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION. THE CALIFORNIA BAD PLAN DOES NOT VALUE THAT THE FACT OVER BUT THE CLOCK THE BED BY THE QUALITY OF THE PRODUCT. ALL IT DOES IS RECOGNIZE THE VALUE IN INVESTING IN THE CURRENT SYSTEM AWARDING CONTRACTS. INHERENTLY REWARD BAD ACTOR I AM ONLY TAKING QUALITY AND COST INTO CONSIDERATION THE GOVERNMENT ISN'T AN EXACT THING WE WILL TAKE THEM BACK TO THE MAIN PRODUCT. NO MATTER WHAT. WHEN COMPANIES CAN'T COMBINE QUALITY IF YOU CAN BY LABOR COSTS DOWN. AND WHEN THEY DO THAT REAL PEOPLE BUT VERY PEOPLE WHO TAX DOLLARS ARE BEING USED TO FUND THE CONTRACT. I DON'T WANT TO GET HURT. I THINK SIX SEVEN FOR IT HOW WE SHIP FRAMEWORK I'M READY FOR THE BOTTOM. OF THE TOP. IF YOU CAN YOU CARE ABOUT COST HE CARE ABOUT QUALITY AND- ABOUT THE PEOPLE. AND JOB MEREKA WE HAVE SEEN JUST HOW MUCH POLICIES LIKE THAT CAN TRANSFORM COMMUNITIES. THE CALIFORNIA JOB PLAN ABSOLUTION OF A POLICY CALLED THE U. S. EMPLOYMENT PLAN OR USD JPY FOR SHORT WHICH HAD BEEN USED ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND HAS BEEN APPROVED BY THE FEDERAL DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION. ANY- ANY AMTRAK USED TO BE LIKE PPL ON A- AWARDED ALL THEM THAT WOULD CREATE THIRTEEN HUNDRED JOBS IN MORE THAN NINETY CITIES ACROSS. YEAH I'M A CONTRACTOR THEY ARE. WHICH RESULTED IN ANY FACTOR ON THE SOUTHEAST OF CHICAGO. READING OF TWO HUNDRED JOBS CONSTRUCTION AT LEAST A HUNDRED SEVENTY. PRODUCTION AND RIGHT HEARING HEALTH FOR. OUR METRO APPLIED BIELECKI ON A CONTRACT WITH THE SHARIA THAT RESULTED IN A NEW FAD AND LOOKING COUNTY AND THE CREATION FOR HER AND FOUR HI. JOB. THE COMPANY MAKE REAL COMMAND TWENTY IN CAN. IMMUNITY TRêN. YEAH MAYBE WHY WE TO CAL JOHN IF THERE ARE ALREADY AND PRIOR HI PAUL JOBS AND JOB OPPORTUNITIES FOR INTO THE IN VARIOUS EMPLOYMENT OR PROGRAM THAT DIRECTLY ON ENHANCE. AND THE ANSWER. TO TAKE ACTION. MILLION OF PEOPLE ARE ON A AND NOT IS THIS QUITE CARRIED BY PEOPLE OF COLOR AND OTHER IN THE ANYTHING. CHANGE EFFECTIVE ARE ALREADY. CARRIED BY PEOPLE OF COLOR AND LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES COULD HURT THE LACK OF ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE AND TYPICALLY LIVING WITH HIGHER AND WE- AND OTHER APPLE. THANK. WE HAVE PROOF THAT POLICY WORK.

BUSHER WITH MADAM CHAIR CURRENTLY- IN SANDERS I'M PLEASED TO PRESENT SENATE BILL TWO THIRTEEN WHICH- WE'LL CREATE A WORKERS COMPENSATION REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION FOR HOSPITAL PLEASE PROVIDE DIRECT PATIENT CARE IN ACUTE HOSPITAL SETTING. FOR ISSUES SUCH AS INFECTIOUS DISEASE CANCER. A MONTH MUSCO SKELETAL INJURY POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER AND RESPIRATORY ILLNESS INCLUDING KOBE NINETEEN WORKERS COMPENSATION PRESUMPTIONS EXISTS FOR CERTAIN FRONTLINE PROFESSIONS SUCH AS FIREFIGHTERS BECAUSE THEY'RE IN A BIT INEVITABLY EXPOSED DOZENS OF POTENTIAL ILLNESSES AS A CONDITION OF THEIR WORK. MANY OF WHICH LEAD TO HEALTH ISSUES SUCH AS INFECTIOUS DISEASES RESPIRATORY ILLNESSES AND CANCER. PRESUMPTIONS ARE WAY TO SCREAM ON TREATMENT FOR WORKERS BY REDUCING THE BURDEN OF PROOF THAT THEIR INJURY ILLNESS WAS CAUSED. BY THE NATURE OF THE EMPLOYMENT. THESE ILLNESSES AND INJURIES ARE SIMPLY PRESUME TO BECAUSE BY THE NATURE THE EMPLOYEES WORK. THIS PROTECTS THE EMPLOYEE FROM HOSPITAL OR SURGICAL COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH A HEALTH ISSUE. ONLY CERTAIN TYPES OF FRONTLINE PROFESSIONALS ARE CURRENTLY ELIGIBLE FOR WORKERS COMPENSATION PRESUMPTIONS. PLEASE INCLUDE PROFESSIONS SUCH AS EMTS PARAMEDICS FIREFIGHTERS AND POLICE OFFICERS. HOLD WHICH HAPPEN TO BE MALE DOMINATED FIELDS. MEANWHILE FRONTLINE WORKERS WHO WORK IN HEALTH CARE SETTING SUCH AS NURSES ARE NOT ENTITLED TO WORKERS COMPENSATION PRESUMPTIONS. THEN I SHOULD NOTE. THAT PROFESSION IS STILL A FEMALE DOMINATED. THE FIELD BY GENDER THIS IS DESPITE THE FACT. THAT NURSES TREAT THE SAME PATIENTS IN HOSPITALS. LAKE CITY OPTIONS FOR TREATING IN THE FIELD. THIS BILL RECOGNIZES AND ADDRESSES A WORKERS COMPENSATION PRESUMPTION SHOULD BE AVAILABLE FOR ALL FRONTLINE PROFESSIONS WERE RISK OF THE SAME ILLNESSES AND INJURIES TO THE NATURE OF THE WORK. AND I SHOULD SAY THAT. BUT WE VIEWS EXPRESSION OFTEN THAT THE PANDEMIC HAS LAID BARE. A CERTAIN INEQUITIES AND I WOULD SUBMIT. THAT THIS IS ONE OF THOSE INEQUITIES THAT IS BEEN LAID BARE BY THE PANDEMIC. SB TWO THIRTEEN RECOGNIZES THAT HEALTH CARE WORKERS SUCH AS NURSES ARE ON THE FRONT LINES AND FEES MANY OF THE SAME HEALTH SERVICES PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICERS SPECIFICALLY THIS BILL CREATES A WORKERS COMPENSATION REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION FOR HOSPITAL PLEASE PROVIDE DIRECT PATIENT CARE IN THOSE AREAS I MENTIONED EARLIER- IN- THE QUEUE HOSPITAL SETTINGS. AND AGAIN SUCH AS INFECTIOUS DISEASE CANCER MOSKAL MUSCULOSKELETAL INJURY POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER AND RESPIRATORY ILLNESS INCLUDING COVERT. IT WILL MODERNIZE. THE BILL OF MODERNIZE OUTDATED CALIFORNIA LAWS TO MAKE IT. EASIER FOR REGISTERED NURSES TO ACCESS THE WORKERS COMPENSATION SYSTEM JUST LIKE THE LAW CURRENTLY. PROVIDES. ACCESS FOR OTHER FRONTLINE WORKERS. THIS WILL ENSURE FIRST RESPONDER WORKERS. HAVE ACCESS TO THE SAME WORKERS COMPENSATION PRESUMPTIONS IS A VITAL STEP IN ACHIEVING ECONOMIC AND GENDER EQUALITY. WHAT IS TODAY IS KERN SLANG FOR THE CALIFORNIA NURSES ASSOCIATION TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT- AND CATHERINE DONOHUE CONNECT REGISTERED NURSE THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT AND ABOUT HER OWN LIVED EXPERIENCE ACCESSING. WORKERS COMPENSATION SYSTEM. THANK YOU MEMBERS SURE. THANK YOU SENATOR CORTESE. WE WILL NOW MOVE ON TO ANYONE ONE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT AND YOU HAVE A LEAD AUTHOR AUTHOR FOR LEAD SUPPORTER ON THE LINE. ONE MOMENT PLEASE YES GOOD EVENING. GOOD EVENING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS. I'M CHRIS LANG OF THE CALIFORNIA NURSES ASSOCIATION OUT ONTO THE PASSED BETWEEN. ONE THREE WE THANK US SENATOR CORTES IGOR'S LEADERSHIP NOT TRUSTING THIS IMPORTANT MATTER FOR MEMBERS. ALSO RECORD CHAMPIONS INDICATED S. B. TWO ONE THREE IS MUCH NEEDED LEGISLATION THAT PROVIDES ADDITIONAL PROTECTION. BUT WE HAVE WORKERS COMPENSATION PRESUMPTIVE ELIGIBILITY FOR HEALTHCARE WORKERS ON THE FRONTLINE. AND SEEK TO ACHIEVE PARITY BETWEEN PREDOMINATELY FEMALE ARE AND- AND HOSPITAL WORKERS ASSEMBLY MALE FIREFIGHTER. FIREFIGHTERS POLICE OFFICERS AND OTHER FIRST. RESPONDERS FOR FRONT LINE WORKERS. I THE CENTER HAS NO THE LEAD. HAS TO DO PARTS. REQUIRED BY AND POSE OFFICERS VEHICLE ON TO BUILD. WHILE NURSES AND HEALTHCARE WERE OVER WELL WENT. IN OUR TREATING THE SAME PATIENT ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR PRESUMPTION. BY THE NATURE OF THEIR PROFESSION NURSES AND HEALTHCARE WORKERS ARE IN CONSTANT DANGER OF BEING DIRECTLY EXPOSED THE SAME HAZARDS AS FIREFIGHTERS AND POLICE OFFICERS INCLUDING IMPRESSES DISEASES AND RESPIRATORY DISEASES SUCH AS COVER NINETEEN. CARCINOGENS ARE BENAMI HAZARDS INFORMATIK YOU DANCE. IN FACT REGISTERED NURSES EXPERIENCE WORK MORE WORK RELATED INJURIES AND ILLNESSES AND WORKERS OVERALL IN NINE STATES INCLUDING OVER OF ALL KIND. 3% MORE MUSCULOSKELETAL DISORDERS 22% HAVE SYMPTOMS OF POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER. ONE HUNDRED AND 31% MORE INTEREST FROM WORKPLACE VIOLENCE IN TWENTY FOUR U. S. STATES FOUND SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED. MORTALITY AMONG NURSES TO CANCER. THE NURSES CAN HELP THERE'S A ALREADY STATED AND HEALTH WORKERS TREAT SAME NOT TO. THAT ARE FROM. WORKERS TREATING THE STILL. NURSES ACTUALLY SPEND MORE TIME WITH THESE PATIENT IN KOSOVO IN IMPOSSIBILITIES. NURSING THEM BACK TO HELP DESK INCREASING THEIR RISK AND EXPOSURE TO HAZARDS IN HOMES. THESE HEROES NEED THE SAME PROTECTION THE COURT TO PUT ON THE MAIL- FIREFIGHT AND POLICE OFFICERS. OPPOSITION TO THIS MEASURE INDICATES THAT HOSPITALS ARE CONTROLLED ENVIRONMENT AND THUS THERE'S NO NEED FOR PRESUMPTION FOR WORKERS IN THE HOSPITAL ENVIRONMENT OR SETTING I OVER DATA DO NOT SUPPORT THIS ARGUMENT AS OF YESTERDAY CALIFORNIA LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS HAVE REPORTED A HUNDRED THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTY FOUR CONFIRMED POSITIVE NOVEL CORONAVIRUS TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN CASES AND FOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTY NINE DEATHS IN NURSES AND HEALTHCARE WORKERS IN THIS BIGGER INCLUDES. ON THE JOB EXPOSURES. ADDITIONALLY MANY WHO OPPOSE THIS MEASURE STATE THAT THERE'S A COMPLETE LACK OF EVIDENCE THAT THE CURRENT PROCESS IS NOT WORKING. AND THERE'S NO DATA TO SUGGEST TO DEMONSTRATE THAT WORKERS COMP CLAIMS HAVE BEEN DENIED. NEVERTHELESS OUR MEMBERS REPORT SIGNIFICANT ISSUES WITH ACCESS TO THE WORKERS COMPENSATION SYSTEM. DATA FROM WORKERS COMPENSATION CARRIERS DO NOT CAPTURE MANY INSTANCES WHERE NURSES DO NOT EVEN FILE REPORTS COMPLAINTS. BECAUSE THE SYSTEM IS SO BURDENSOME OR WHEN EMPLOYER TELLS A NURSE THAT THEIR INJURY WAS NOT SUFFICIENTLY WORK RELATED AND THEREFORE DO NOT FILE. EMPLOYERS OFTEN TELL NURSES TO YOU THE ONLY PAID SICK LEAVE AND OTHER TIME INSTEAD OF APPROVAL USING. THE WORKERS COMPENSATION SYSTEM. ENCLOSING IT IS EVIDENT THAT HEALTHCARE WORKERS SUCH AS NURSES ARE INDEED ON THE FRONT LINES AND MANY OF THE SAME RISK PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICERS. IT'S NOT ENOUGH JUST TO COOK PROCLAIM THAT NURSES ARE HEROES LET'S PUT ACTION TO WORDS TODAY BY MODERNIZING. OUTDATED CALIFORNIA LAW. EASIER FOR NOW IN HEALTH CARE WORKERS TO THE WORKERS COMP YOU JUST. ACCORDING THEY RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON S. B.

BY FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH HEALTH AND SAFETY LAWS SB SIX OH SIX BUILD OFF OF FEDERAL OSHA'S CORPORATE WIDE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT POLICY BY PROVIDING CAL OSHA WITH THE AUTHORITY TO ISSUE A SUSPENSION OR TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER AT ALL LOCATIONS UNDER COMMON OWNERSHIP WANTED EMPLOYERS POLICIES AND PROCEDURES DIRECTLY VIOLATE LABOR AND HEALTH AND SAFETY SAFETY STANDARDS. AS A FORMER CHAIR OF THE SENATE SPECIAL COMMITTEE ON PANDEMIC EMERGENCY RESPONSE I HELD AN OVERSIGHT MEETING LAST YEAR ON WORKPLACE SAFETY HEALTH AND SAFETY ISSUES DURING THE COVERED NINETEEN PANDEMIC SPECIFICALLY LOOKING AT. THE ROLE OF ESSENTIAL WORKERS WHAT WE LEARNED THAT CAL OSHA HAS BEEN INUNDATED WITH MORE COMPLAINTS AND THERE CAN INSPECTORS CAN HANDLE. LEADING STAFF TO INCREASINGLY RELY ON LETTER ONLY INVESTIGATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN INSUFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVELY. PROTECTING FRONT LINE WORKERS. SB SIX OF SIX PROVIDES HELLO SHE WITH THE NECESSARY TOOLS TO MAXIMIZE THE USE OF THEIR LIMITED RESOURCES SO THEY'RE ABLE TO RESPOND MORE EFFECTIVELY. FOR THE MORE IT ESTABLISHES A REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION FOR RETALIATION THAT WILL PROTECT WORKERS WHO COME FORWARD WITH A POSITIVE COVER NINETEEN TEST. WORKERS WHO REQUESTED TESTER PP AND THOSE WHO REPORT UNSAFE CONDITIONS IF WORKERS ARE NOT CONFIDENT THEY WILL BE PROTECTED FROM RETALIATION THEY WILL BE LESS LIKELY TO COME FORWARD AND REPORT VIOLATIONS.

A HARVARD UNIVERSITY STUDY FOUND THAT ONE IN FIVE GROCERY WORKERS TESTED POSITIVE FOR CO THE NINETEENTH AND WORKERS WHO INTERACT WITH CUSTOMERS ARE FIVE TIMES MORE LIKELY TO TEST POSITIVE. I BELIEVE FORTINET PANDEMIC AND LOOK BACK AT WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN DONE BETTER YOU RECOGNIZE THAT COALITION IS SEVERELY UNDERSTAFFED AND UNDER REPORT AND LACK THE NECESSARY TOOLS TO HOLD LARGE EMPLOYERS AND TRAIN EMPLOYERS ACCOUNTABLE FOR KEEPING WORKERS SAFE ON THE JOB. CURRENT LAW DOES NOT PERMIT COLORS RIGHT TO LEVY FINES OR OTHER REMEDIES AT THE VISION. FIVE OR CONSEQUENCE- DEADLY CONDUCT LOGICAL. MAKING FORCE BUT NEEDLESS DUPLICATE EVIDENCE. AND SHALL NOT THE CREDIT ROLE COMP PLAY AND THE APPS TRIED THAT. AND PRIORITIZE WORKERS BY. THIS IS WHY WE NEED A SIX SIX. THANK YOU CENTER GUMBALL FOR ALL LOCAL AND- SB SIX SIX SEVEN ASSEMBLY JUST RAISE CAO SEX. DID FOR THE PLAYERS. I THINK THE TARGETED A PRO TO RAISE PENALTY FOR LARGE EMPLOYERS.

CERTAINLY THANK YOU MISTER BURKE IMAGE SO WITH THE CAL LABOR FOR PRODUCT SPONSOR THE BILL ALONG WITH YOU YOU TO BE IN SAFE WATER BRIEFLY TOUCH SOME OF THE THAT WERE TAKE THE WAYS THAT THOSE ADDRESS SOME OF THE OPPOSITION. THE FIRST IS THAT THE OPPOSITE THAT STATED THAT THERE WERE A THAT NOTHING IN THE BILL IS COVERED SPECIFIC WE ARE RESPOND BY SPECIAL THAT REPORT PRESUMPTION OVERTIME. IS COVERED NINETEEN SPECIFIC THE OPPOSITION HAS ALSO ARGUED THAT THE AGREE JUST EMPLOYER SECTION IS EXCESSIVE AND WILL SHUT DOWN BUSINESSES WE ARE TAKING A MYSTIC CLARIFY THAT SECTION ONLY APPLIES TO CERTAIN TYPES OF WILLFUL VIOLATIONS WHICH ARE THEMSELVES INCREDIBLY RARE BECAUSE QALISYA HAS TO PROVE INTENT WHICH IS ALMOST ALWAYS SOMETHING THAT THEY CAN'T DO SO IT SHOULD BE A VERY TINY NUMBER NUMBER OF EMPLOYERS THAT THIS ACTUALLY APPLIES TO. WERE ALSO TAKEN MOMENTS THAT WILL CLARIFY THE SECTION THAT ALLOWS CAL OSHA THE SITE THE STATUTE ONLY APPLIES TO LABOR CODE DIVISION FIVE AND A CERTAIN HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE RELATED TO WORKER HEALTH AND SAFETY BECAUSE- RIGHT NOW QALISYA CAN ONLY ENFORCE TITLE EIGHT REGULATIONS SO. FLANK WHICH WILL ALLOW LEGISLATION IS APPROVED BY THE LEGISLATURE TO BE ENFORCED RIGHT NOW WITH BILLS BECOME STATUTE MAY RELATE TO WORKER HEALTH AND SAFETY THERE'S REALLY NO ONE THERE TO ENFORCE THEM IT WAS REALLY IMPORTANT TOOL FOR YOU ALL TO HAVE. IN THE FINAL POINT IS THAT THE OPPOSITION IS ARGUED THAT CITATION SHOULDN'T BE ALLOWED TO WEAR IN PERSON INSPECTIONS HAVEN'T HAPPENED. THEY ARE THEY ALREADY ARE BUT WHAT THE BILL DOES IS CODIFY THE PRACTICE WHILE THE AMENDMENTS WILL CLARIFY THE DUE PROCESS THE COLLEGE A HOUSE TO ENGAGE AND BEFORE FINALIZING A CITATION THINGS LIKE SUBPOENAING WERE- WRITTEN RECORDS GETTING DECLARATIONS FROM WORKERS THINGS LIKE THAT SO.

CHATTY- AWANA ONE POINT THERE OUT CORRECTLY THE THEY NOTED THAT THE COALITION STRUGGLED OF COURSE BEEN HERE BEEN HAVE BEEN ACKNOWLEDGED BY CALLOUS ADD MEETING AS RELATED TO. STAFFING ISSUES WHICH FRANKLY THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ALREADY ADDRESSES CALLAGY IS ALREADY RECEIVING MORE MONEY AND ARE JUST BUILT ON THOSE LONG TERM STAFFING ISSUES THIS BILL WOULD NOT CHANGE THAT THEY SHOULD THE BILL WILL NOT FIX THE STAFFING ISSUES AND NOTHING TO DO WITH THEM IS WHAT MAKES YOUR SEPARATE ON WHAT WE'RE. ACTUALLY DEALING WITH YOUR- TO GET TO THE D. SPECS ONE WITH. FIND ON. WILL BE. BY NORWEGIAN TO AND- AS YOU A HUNDRED TIMES. EVEN THAT THE SCALE CAL.

VALIDATION AND OTHERS WE ALSO HAVE CRIMINAL CODE THAT I WOULD DIRECT THE ATTENTION HERE TO- LABOR CODE SIXTY FOUR TWENTY THREE AND FIFTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE INCLUDE ADDITIONAL FINES AND JAIL TIME. FOR WILLFUL VIOLATOR SO. CALIFORNIA ALREADY LEADING THE WAY HERE WE DON'T SEE. A MULTIPLIER ABOUT TWO HUNDRED TIMES TO BE. TO BE A PRO GIVEN OR ALREADY ON TOP OF THAT. IN ADDITION I'D LIKE TO DEAL WITH THE ISSUE THAT THE MENTION THAT THIS IS TARGETED TO LARGER EMPLOYERS. WE'RE NOT BE ANY PROVISIONS IN THE BILL WHICH IN ANY WAY LIMITED APPLICATIONS.

EXPERT HELLO CHAU LABOR AND BUSINESS IN A ROMAN. BY HAMMERING OUT TERMS THAT ARE APPLICABLE TO WORKPLACES WEEDING IS AN IMPORTANT PROCESS AND THIS BILL WOULD CHORE AT THAT WHICH IS CONCERNING TO US. ACTION THREE AND THIRD RETALIATION PROVISIONS TRY TO BE QUICK I KNOW WE'RE TIGHT ON TIME- EVEN ON WE NEED MAYBE. EVEN IF THEY TO COPE AT NINETEEN. I DUPLICATED OF EXISTING PROTECTIONS PARTICULARLY. AT THE LIGHT IF OUR A AND- PROTECTIONS FOR WORKERS THAT THINK WE WORKERS ALREADY HAVE. FULL REPORTING VIOLATIONS EXISTING LAW OR REGULATION SO FOR EXAMPLE EMPLOYER VIOLATE THE CODE IN NINETEEN EDS- AND REPORTS THAT THEY ARE ALREADY PROTECTED FROM PUNISHMENT THERE SO EVERY EMPLOYER IS NOT PROVIDING THAT. THAT PP. AN AIRPORT THAT THERE'S THE PROTECTION THERE SO THAT'S ALREADY IN PLACE. WHAT WE SEE THE PROBLEM WITH THIS LANGUAGE IS REPEATED BACK ENOUGH. THAT IT WILL CATCH EVEN GOOD PAID EMPLOYERS TRYING TO TERMINATE EMPLOYEE TO. BE TERMINATED OR BOARD TO LET EMPLOYEES GO BECAUSE THEY'RE HAVING FINANCIAL DIFFICULTY DUE TO CALL THE NINETEEN. WE SEE PRODUCTION CONSIDERING MITIGATION THOSE CANARIAS- SO I WILL WRAP UP THERE THANK YOU TO GET YOU TO BE- AND I. YEAH THANK YOU FOR THAT- AND WE ARE CLOSED UNTIL THANK YOU.

THIS IS GOING TO MANIFEST ITSELF- WITH THE REALITY OF HAVING IN A DEPARTMENT THAT ALREADY IS UNDERSTAFFED WITH THAT IN MIND THERE IS ALSO A HUGE CONCERN ON MY BEHALF AS FAR AS THE- PENALTIES GO POTENTIALLY BEING ONE HUNDRED TIMES HIGHER THAN WHAT IS CURRENTLY PRESIDENT- AND THE RISK THAT THIS POSES ON EMPLOYERS IN GENERAL. SO NOT ONLY ARE WE HAVING A- YOU KNOW NEAR THIRTY INCREASE IN PENALTIES IT'S ALSO INCREDIBLY- PUNITIVE TOWARDS AGENCIES- IN THAT RESPECT BT I'LL JUST LEAVE IT AT THAT END AND JUST KIND OF CURIOUS IF THE AUTHOR HAS CONSIDERED WORKING WITH- ORGANISED THE ORGANIZATIONS ARE A CONCERN OPPOSITION.

SOLD OUT IF YOU WILL IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO YOU'VE GOT TO BE PRETTY AGREE JUST TO BE ABLE TO. GET TO THAT THRESHOLD. SECONDLY CLARIFYING CAL OSHA'S ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY IS LIMITED TO THE HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE A CERTAIN SECTION. AND DIVISION FIVE OF THE LABOR CODE SO NOT ALL OF THE LABOR CODE. WE WOULD ALSO BE CLARIFYING. THE REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION FOR RETALIATION WHICH WOULD BE SPECIFIC TO COPE IT.

MEAN WE ARE IN THE COLD WITH THE PANDEMIC HERE. AND FOR MEN AND WOMEN WHO TAKE THE RISK OF GOING TO WORK. THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO RELY ON THE MOST. THE STRONGEST PROTECTIONS FOR THEM THE STRONGEST PROTECTIONS FOR THEM AND- I JUST THINK THAT- FOR US. COMPLETELY WRONG BECAUSE IT'S PRO WORKING MEN AND WOMEN WHO TAKE THOSE RISK OF GOING TO WORK EVERY DAY AND THEY'RE GETTING SICK AND IF WE HAVE EMPLOYERS WHO SEE WHO SEEM TO THINK THAT THEY COULD IGNORE THAT AND- COMMIT REALLY EGREGIOUS VIOLATIONS OF HEALTH AND SAFETY DURING A PANDEMIC. I THINK IT'S SHAMEFUL I JUST THINK IT'S ABSOLUTELY SHAMEFUL AND TO SAY SOMEHOW. THAT BY- HOLDEN THESE ARE THE EMPLOYERS TO COMMIT THESE ACTIONS IN A VERY NARROW WAY THAT SOMEHOW WE'RE ANTI BUSINESS I THINK IS. IS REALLY TWISTING THE WHOLE NOTION THAT YOU CAN BE PRO BUSINESS BUT PRO BOWL HEALTH AND SAFETY ON THE JOB OF THESE WORKING MEN AND WOMEN JUST PUT YOURSELF IN THAT SITUATION WE HAVE TO GO TO WORK AND WE DON'T HAVE ALL THESE PROTECTIONS WE DON'T HAVE ALL THESE TESTS WE DON'T HAVE ALL THESE THINGS THAT ALLOW US TO COME IN. AND FEEL SAFE WE DON'T HAVE ANY OF THAT AND I READ STORY AFTER STORY OF OUR BUSINESSES AND EMPLOYERS WHO WORK. DELIBERATELY IGNORING THE HEALTH PROTOCOLS- SHUTTING DOWN ORDERS BY THE COUNTY'S IRAN TO SHUT DOWN I MEAN THERE'S SOME REALLY. TERRIBLE THINGS THAT ARE GOING ON OUT THERE I THINK WE HAVE TO BE CONSCIOUS AND PROTECT THOSE MEN AND WOMEN WHO ARE TAKING THE RISKS ON OUR BEHALF SO I'M REALLY GLAD THAT YOU'RE.
