00:42:16.133 --> 00:42:18.335
EXISTING VOEPEL PRESIDENCY LAW

00:42:18.402 --> 00:42:20.504
PARK RULES APPLY EQUALLY TO

00:42:20.571 --> 00:42:22.573
MANAGEMENT AND RESIDENTS. AT A

00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:24.174
PARK OWNER IS ALSO ABOUT TO

00:42:24.241 --> 00:42:25.876
FOLLOW ITS RULES PROHIBIT

00:42:25.943 --> 00:42:27.544
EXCEPT LEASING. BARGAINERS

00:42:27.611 --> 00:42:29.046
DISTINGUISH THE OPINION BY

00:42:29.113 --> 00:42:30.714
SAYING WILL PROHIBITING

00:42:30.781 --> 00:42:32.549
RESIDENTS FROM SUB LEASING

00:42:32.616 --> 00:42:34.919
QUOTE UNQUOTE DOES NOT APPLY TO

00:42:34.985 --> 00:42:36.620
THEM SINCE THEY OWN THE HOMES

00:42:36.687 --> 00:42:38.656
AND ARE DIRECTLY WRENCHING THAT

00:42:38.722 --> 00:42:40.891
QUOTE UNQUOTE. BUT THIS IS A

00:42:40.958 --> 00:42:41.492
DISTINCTION WITHOUT A

00:42:41.558 --> 00:42:43.160
DIFFERENCE BECAUSE WHETHER CALL

00:42:43.227 --> 00:42:45.896
THE RATTLERS SUBLEASE THE END

00:42:45.963 --> 00:42:47.698
RESULT IS THE SAP. IT RESIDENTS

00:42:47.765 --> 00:42:49.033
CANNOT SUBLEASE TO READ PARK

00:42:49.099 --> 00:42:50.167
MANAGEMENT SHOULD BE EQUALLY

00:42:50.234 --> 00:42:52.269
BOUT IT SHOULD ABIDE BY ITS OWN

00:42:52.336 --> 00:42:54.271
RULES. THE MRL SHOULD BE

00:42:54.338 --> 00:42:55.539
ADMITTED TO SPECIFICALLY

00:42:55.606 --> 00:42:58.575
ELIMINATE THIS DOUBLE STANDARD.

00:42:58.642 --> 00:43:00.711
TO FINAL KEY POINTS FIRST THIS

00:43:00.778 --> 00:43:02.146
BILL DOES NOT IMPEDE A PARK

00:43:02.212 --> 00:43:03.580
OWNERS ABILITY TO CREATE OR

00:43:03.647 --> 00:43:05.482
CHANGE PARK RULES IF A PARK

00:43:05.549 --> 00:43:06.984
OWNER WISHES TO BAN SUBLEASE

00:43:07.051 --> 00:43:09.053
AGO RANKING. THE KITCHEN USED

00:43:09.119 --> 00:43:10.587
HAVE UNILATERAL ABILITY TO DO

00:43:10.654 --> 00:43:13.190
SO OR IF YOU WISH TO ALLOW SO

00:43:13.257 --> 00:43:15.259
POLICING CORRECTING IF I DO SO.

00:43:15.326 --> 00:43:16.427
SECOND THE BILL DOES NOT

00:43:16.493 --> 00:43:17.428
PREVENT A PARKING OF FROM

00:43:17.494 --> 00:43:19.129
HOUSING EMPLOYEES AT THE PARK

00:43:19.196 --> 00:43:20.965
BUT SIMPLY CLARIFIES ONCE A

00:43:21.031 --> 00:43:23.100
PARK WATER MAKES THE DECISION.

00:43:23.167 --> 00:43:24.635
TO ALLOW OR PROHIBIT SUBLEASE

FAIRLY A BITE. AND FOLLOW THOSE

00:43:32.943 --> 00:43:33.677
SAME RULES. ON THAT BASIS

00:44:00.304 --> 00:44:02.339
TIME SO THANK YOU. FIRST AND

00:44:02.406 --> 00:44:03.340
FOREMOST THE FUNDAMENTAL

00:44:03.407 --> 00:44:04.008
PREMISE IS WRONG BETWEEN

00:44:04.074 --> 00:44:05.809
SUBLETTING RENTING THE PARK

00:44:05.876 --> 00:44:07.911
OWNER DOESN'T SUBLET AND HAS A

00:44:07.978 --> 00:44:10.180
CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATION. SOMEONE

00:44:10.247 --> 00:44:11.749
WHO RENTS THE LAND FROM US THEN

00:44:11.815 --> 00:44:13.417
RE RENTS A SOMEONE WHO WE DON'T

00:44:13.484 --> 00:44:14.785
HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH US IS

00:44:14.852 --> 00:44:16.887
A SUB LETTER. APARTMENTS ARE

00:44:16.954 --> 00:44:18.622
STATUTORILY FORBIDDEN FROM

00:44:18.689 --> 00:44:20.457
SUBLETTING IN CALIFORNIA AND IN

00:44:20.524 --> 00:44:21.859
OUR RESEARCH WE CAN'T FIND

00:44:21.925 --> 00:44:24.128
OTHER STATES THAT ALLOW IT. NOR

00:44:24.194 --> 00:44:25.295
THAT MANDATE THE MOBILE HOME

00:44:25.362 --> 00:44:26.797
PARK ON IS AFTER ALLOW AND

00:44:26.864 --> 00:44:27.731
THAT'S BECAUSE OF THE FACT ON

00:44:27.798 --> 00:44:28.966
RENT CONTROL IF YOU SIMPLY

00:44:29.033 --> 00:44:30.968
ALLOW SUBLETTING EVERYWHERE IT

00:44:31.035 --> 00:44:32.503
WILL BLOW UP AND MAKE RECONCILE

00:44:32.569 --> 00:44:34.238
POINTLESS. HOW DOES THIS HELP

00:44:34.304 --> 00:44:35.739
PROVIDE A PUT A ROOF OVER

00:44:35.806 --> 00:44:37.674
ANYONE TELL OVER ANYONE'S HEAD

00:44:37.741 --> 00:44:38.876
IN FACT THIS WILL SIMPLY TURN

00:44:38.942 --> 00:44:40.277
MOBILE HOMES INTO VACATION AND

00:44:40.344 --> 00:44:41.979
SHORT TERM RENTALS FROM SUB

00:44:42.046 --> 00:44:43.747
LESSEES UP AND DOWN THE STATE

00:44:43.814 --> 00:44:44.715
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE COST OF

00:44:44.782 --> 00:44:46.016
HOUSING ESPECIALLY IN COASTAL

00:44:46.083 --> 00:44:47.951
CITIES THIS ASSEMBLY TURN INTO

00:44:48.018 --> 00:44:49.420
A COTTAGE BUSINESS INDUSTRY FOR

00:44:49.486 --> 00:44:50.154
PEOPLE TO MAKE MONEY BECAUSE

00:44:50.220 --> 00:44:52.523
THERE'S NO LIMITS. ALSO IF THIS

00:44:52.589 --> 00:44:54.024
PASSES SO IN THE PRACTICE OF

00:44:54.091 --> 00:44:55.659
MOBILE HOME RENTALS VERSUS

00:44:55.726 --> 00:44:57.628
FORCING PEOPLE TO BUY HOMES THE

00:44:57.694 --> 00:44:59.296
REASON WHY MANY HOME OWNERS

00:44:59.363 --> 00:45:00.397
HAVE HOMES IS BECAUSE IN THE

00:45:00.464 --> 00:45:02.032
EIGHTIES AND NINETIES WHEN

00:45:02.099 --> 00:45:03.634
FORECLOSURES AND OTHER THINGS

00:45:03.700 --> 00:45:04.401
HAPPEN AND PEOPLE JUST

00:45:04.468 --> 00:45:06.136
ABANDONED HOMES WE'VE TAKEN

00:45:06.203 --> 00:45:07.938
OVER IF THIS BILL PASSES IT

00:45:08.005 --> 00:45:09.273
WILL SAY UNLESS WE ALLOW

00:45:09.339 --> 00:45:11.075
SUBLETTING FOR EVERYONE. IF WE

00:45:11.141 --> 00:45:12.476
TAKE OVER A HOME BECAUSE

00:45:12.543 --> 00:45:13.877
SOMEONE LEFT IT ABANDONED WE'LL

00:45:13.944 --> 00:45:15.579
JUST LEAVE IT VACANT BECAUSE IN

00:45:15.646 --> 00:45:17.381
A LOT OF AREAS WE CAN'T SELL IT

00:45:17.448 --> 00:45:19.216
WE'VE HAD PEOPLE THAT AT THIRTY

00:45:19.283 --> 00:45:19.983
FIVE RENTAL HOMES IN THE

00:45:20.050 --> 00:45:21.151
EIGHTIES AND NINETIES THERE NOW

00:45:21.218 --> 00:45:22.486
DOWN TO THREE BECAUSE THE

00:45:22.553 --> 00:45:23.754
MARKET OVER THE PAST THIRTY

00:45:23.821 --> 00:45:28.025
YEARS WASN'T THERE. FOR THEM TO

00:45:28.092 --> 00:45:29.193
SELL IT NOW THEY ARE. AFTER THE

00:45:29.259 --> 00:45:30.494
OWNERS OF FOR TO DO TO THINGS.

00:45:30.561 --> 00:45:33.964
BY GIVE MYSELF TIME OWNERS WILL

00:45:34.031 --> 00:45:35.399
EITHER HAVE TO DO A SUBLETTING

00:45:35.466 --> 00:45:37.601
POLICY FOR EVERYONE IN THE PARK

00:45:37.668 --> 00:45:39.369
OR THE HAVE TO FORCIBLY SELL

00:45:39.436 --> 00:45:40.971
OTHER PARK ON RENTALS WHICH

00:45:41.038 --> 00:45:41.905
MEANS THAT MOBILE HOME PARKS

00:45:41.972 --> 00:45:43.907
WILL BE ONLY FOR PEOPLE TO

00:45:43.974 --> 00:45:45.142
HOMEOWNERSHIP AND YOU'LL NEVER

00:45:45.209 --> 00:45:46.477
HAVE ANOTHER OWN PARK RENTAL

00:45:46.543 --> 00:45:48.112
AGAIN WE DON'T THINK THIS IS

00:45:48.178 --> 00:45:48.979
GOOD SUB WE DON'T THINK THAT'S

00:45:49.046 --> 00:45:50.747
A GOOD POLICY AND WE THINK THAT

00:45:50.814 --> 00:45:52.382
YOU'RE CONFLATING TWO CONCEPTS

00:45:52.449 --> 00:45:53.984
RUNNING ON SUB LEASING AND FOR

00:45:54.051 --> 00:45:54.952
THESE WE THINK THIS IS BAD

00:45:55.018 --> 00:45:57.187
POLICY FOR HOUSING IN THE

00:45:57.254 --> 00:45:58.555

00:54:19.122 --> 00:54:21.424
TALKING ABOUT. THE MOST

00:54:21.491 --> 00:54:24.160
VULNERABLE POPULATION OUT THERE

PARK OWNERS DON'T WANT THAT TO

00:54:47.350 --> 00:54:48.218

RULE. IT'S JUST WHEN THEY MAKE

00:54:50.520 --> 00:54:52.355
THE RULE IT SHOULD APPLY TO

00:54:52.422 --> 00:54:54.924

STOCK OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING OUT

00:55:30.393 --> 00:55:32.495
THERE. BECAUSE THEY WILL HAVE

00:55:32.562 --> 00:55:34.230
AND BE ABLE TO GET THE RULES TO

00:55:34.297 --> 00:55:35.632
APPLY DIFFERENTLY WHEN IT COMES

00:55:35.699 --> 00:55:37.801

01:13:50.659 --> 01:13:51.560
TOO MANY WAYS ON MY GAS

01:13:51.627 --> 01:13:56.165
ELECTRIC YEAH USABLE SYSTEMS

01:13:56.231 --> 01:13:56.799
PRIVATE WELLS AND EVERYTHING IN

01:13:56.865 --> 01:13:57.599
BETWEEN. THE FACT OF THE MATTER

01:13:57.666 --> 01:13:59.234
IS IN MOBILE HOME PARKS THESE

01:13:59.301 --> 01:14:01.436
WATER SYSTEMS ARE CONSTRUCTED

01:14:01.503 --> 01:14:03.172
IN PUT IT TO THE GROUND BEFORE

01:14:03.238 --> 01:14:06.008
THE PARK OPENS. AND MOST ALL

01:14:06.074 --> 01:14:08.777
PARKS IN CALIFORNIA DID NOT

01:14:08.844 --> 01:14:10.913
START OUT BEING SET METER PARKS.

01:14:10.979 --> 01:14:11.980
THE WATER LINE YOU'RE PUT IN

01:14:12.047 --> 01:14:14.283
PERHAPS BY MUNICIPAL- WATER

01:14:14.349 --> 01:14:15.784
COMPANIES PERHAPS BY THE PARK

01:14:15.851 --> 01:14:17.920
OWNER IN ALL DIFFERENT MATTERS

01:14:17.986 --> 01:14:19.788
OF SPEAKING WE DON'T KNOW. BUT

01:14:19.855 --> 01:14:21.490
THE POINT IS THAT WHEN THOSE

01:14:21.557 --> 01:14:22.691
SYSTEM DURING THE GROUND IN

01:14:22.758 --> 01:14:23.692
THEIR NOT SO PETER IF THEY

01:14:23.759 --> 01:14:25.460
BREAK THE PARK OWNER HAS TO FIX

01:14:25.527 --> 01:14:27.229
THAT PERHAPS AND THE WAY THAT

01:14:27.296 --> 01:14:29.031
THEY'RE COMPENSATED IS THROUGH.

01:14:29.097 --> 01:14:31.099
INCREASED RATS THROUGH PASS

01:14:31.166 --> 01:14:32.534
THROUGHS THAT ARE ALLOWED IN

01:14:32.601 --> 01:14:35.237
LONG TERM LEASES. OR WHEN THEY

01:14:35.304 --> 01:14:36.305
BRING ADMINISTRATIVE RAN

01:14:36.371 --> 01:14:37.940
HEARINGS OR CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT

01:14:38.006 --> 01:14:39.174
PASSED THROUGH HEARINGS IN

01:14:39.241 --> 01:14:40.375
LOCAL RENT CONTROL

01:14:40.442 --> 01:14:42.578
JURISDICTIONS. WHEN THEY SUB

01:14:42.644 --> 01:14:45.180
METER THE WATER NOTHING CHANGES

01:14:45.247 --> 01:14:47.249
THEY THEY STILL ARE ENTITLED TO

01:14:47.316 --> 01:14:49.184
COMPENSATION FROM ALL THOSE

01:14:49.251 --> 01:14:51.553
DIFFERENT SOURCES. SO STATE NOW

01:14:51.620 --> 01:14:53.889
THAT IF THEY CAN'T REPLICATE

01:14:53.956 --> 01:14:56.024
THE CUSTOMER CHARGE TO EVERY

01:14:56.091 --> 01:14:57.793
SINGLE SPACE IN THE PARK.

01:14:57.860 --> 01:14:59.428
MULTIPLYING WHAT THEY PAY BY

01:14:59.494 --> 01:15:00.829
THE NUMBER OF SPACES THAT

01:15:00.896 --> 01:15:01.897
THEY'RE UNABLE TO MAINTAIN

01:15:01.964 --> 01:15:04.266
THEIR SYSTEMS IS JUST WRONG.

01:15:04.333 --> 01:15:06.101
THAT THAT. JUST DOESN'T CHANGE

01:15:06.168 --> 01:15:07.803
ANYTHING. THE FACT OF THE

01:15:07.870 --> 01:15:09.371
MATTER IS THAT WHEN PARK

01:15:09.438 --> 01:15:11.640
MANAGEMENT. READ METERS THEY

01:15:11.707 --> 01:15:13.742
ONLY HAVE TO WALK A FEW FEET

01:15:13.809 --> 01:15:15.744
BETWEEN THE METERS TO DO SO.

01:15:15.811 --> 01:15:18.180
THE ONLY ITEM REALLY THAT THE

01:15:18.247 --> 01:15:20.749
PARK OWNER- IT BECOMES

01:15:20.816 --> 01:15:23.118
RESPONSIBLE FOR ON A NEW BASIS

01:15:23.185 --> 01:15:24.887
WOULD BE THE PETER ITSELF AND

01:15:24.953 --> 01:15:26.555
THERE ARE MANY PARKS WHERE

01:15:26.622 --> 01:15:28.523
RESIDENTS ARE ACTUALLY CHARGED.

01:15:28.590 --> 01:15:30.392
THE COST TO INSTALL THE METERS

01:15:30.459 --> 01:15:32.928
AS WELL. AND THEY PAY AGAIN CA

01:15:32.995 --> 01:15:35.197
RATS CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PASS

01:15:35.264 --> 01:15:36.698
THROUGHS WHEN RECORDS WILL

01:15:36.765 --> 01:15:39.268
JURISDICTIONS TO THE PROVISIONS

01:15:39.334 --> 01:15:41.503
THAT THOSE STATUTES ALLOW. ALL

01:15:41.570 --> 01:15:43.572
WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE THIS

01:15:43.639 --> 01:15:46.642
PROJECT THE UNFAIR REPLICATION

01:15:46.708 --> 01:15:48.110
OF THESE CUSTOMER SERVICE

01:15:48.176 --> 01:15:51.146
CHARGES. OR THE OPPORTUNITY TO

01:15:51.213 --> 01:15:58.487
CONFLATE. THEM WRONGFULLY. THIS

01:15:58.553 --> 01:15:59.521
SHARES LIKE ONE OF THE

01:15:59.588 --> 01:16:00.322

IS WHEN THE PARKS ARE BUILT

01:16:10.699 --> 01:16:12.801
MUNICIPALITIES DON'T PUT IN THE

01:16:12.868 --> 01:16:15.070

UNIQUE UNDERSTANDING OF THIS

01:18:10.619 --> 01:18:12.821
WATER SYSTEM ISSUE AND THE

01:18:12.888 --> 01:18:14.389
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OUTSIDE THE

01:18:14.456 --> 01:18:15.857

ASSEMBLY HEARING ISSUE GOES

01:18:23.698 --> 01:18:24.166
BEYOND WHAT YOU'RE TALKING

01:18:24.232 --> 01:18:26.668
ABOUT A GOES- INTO TIERED WATER

01:18:26.735 --> 01:18:30.405
RATES. DAYS THAT WHEN THEY BILL

01:18:30.472 --> 01:18:31.573
THIRTY SIX DAYS INSTEAD OF

01:18:31.640 --> 01:18:33.675
THIRTY DAYS AND DON'T CHANGE

01:18:33.742 --> 01:18:36.244
THE ALLOCATION AMOUNT- THAT CAN

01:18:36.311 --> 01:18:37.679
LEAD TO AS MUCHAS A THOUSAND

01:18:37.746 --> 01:18:39.214
DOLLARS A YEAR OVER PAYMENT FOR

01:18:39.281 --> 01:18:41.716
RESIDENTIAL PEOPLE HOWEVER WHAT

01:18:41.783 --> 01:18:42.551
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE IS THE

01:18:42.617 --> 01:18:43.852
INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE

01:18:43.919 --> 01:18:47.089
INFRASTRUCTURE IS EXPENSIVE AND

01:18:47.155 --> 01:18:48.190
IT DOES NEED TO BE CONSTANTLY

01:18:48.256 --> 01:18:49.925
REPAIRED AND RIGHT NOW THE

01:18:49.991 --> 01:18:52.727
MOBILE HOME OWNERS THE OWNERS.

01:18:52.794 --> 01:18:55.464
HAVE TO SOMEHOW REACHING THAT

01:18:55.530 --> 01:18:59.167
ANGER AND IF YOU'RE TRYING TO

01:18:59.234 --> 01:19:00.535
ENSURE THAT THEY'RE NOT TAKING

01:19:00.602 --> 01:19:03.472
ADVANTAGE OF THAT AND CHARGING

01:19:03.538 --> 01:19:05.373
MORE THAN WHAT IS NECESSARY YOU

01:19:05.440 --> 01:19:07.342
KNOW THAT'S SOMETHING I CAN GET

01:19:07.409 --> 01:19:08.777
BEHIND THE TRYING TO ELIMINATE

01:19:08.844 --> 01:19:10.879
IT AND I DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY

01:19:10.946 --> 01:19:13.415
WOULD GET THE MONEY TO BE ABLE

01:19:13.482 --> 01:19:14.916
TO RECOUP THAT OTHER THAN DOING

01:19:14.983 --> 01:19:17.385
MASSIVE ASSESSMENTS. ON PEOPLE

01:19:17.452 --> 01:19:21.857
WHEN. THEY HAVE TO DO A FIFTY

01:19:21.923 --> 01:19:22.457
SIXTY SEVENTY THOUSAND DOLLAR

01:19:22.524 --> 01:19:24.426
REPAIR AND I DON'T THINK THE

01:19:24.493 --> 01:19:28.363
MOBILE HOME OWNERS- WOULD TAKE

01:19:28.430 --> 01:19:30.298
KINDLY DO THAT EITHER- SO THIS

01:19:30.365 --> 01:19:31.466
IS ONE OF THOSE THOSE

01:19:31.533 --> 01:19:33.368
INTERESTING ISSUES WHERE WE'RE

01:19:33.435 --> 01:19:35.137
TRYING TO KEEP PEOPLE FROM

01:19:35.203 --> 01:19:37.506
GETTING RIPPED OFF MAYBE ON ONE

01:19:37.572 --> 01:19:39.941
HAND BUT AT THE SAME TIME- YOU

01:19:40.008 --> 01:19:41.009
KNOW THESE INFRASTRUCTURE

01:19:41.076 --> 01:19:43.879
ISSUES THERE ARE LARGE AND- AND

01:19:43.945 --> 01:19:45.113
THE WAY THE SYSTEM IS SET UP

01:19:45.180 --> 01:19:47.516
RIGHT NOW THEY NEED TO TRY TO.

01:19:47.582 --> 01:19:48.984
YOU KNOW HAVE HAVE A

01:19:49.050 --> 01:19:52.154
MAINTENANCE FUNDS FOR THAT AND-

01:19:52.220 --> 01:19:53.522
IF THEY HAVE H. AWAY FEES OR

01:19:53.588 --> 01:19:55.123
THINGS LIKE THAT THAT'S WHERE A

01:19:55.190 --> 01:19:56.858
LOT OF TIMES EVERYTHING GETS

01:19:56.925 --> 01:20:02.964
PUT INTO- SO- IF YOU DON'T HAVE

01:20:03.031 --> 01:20:05.066
THIS IS. YOU KNOW WATER MEET

01:20:05.133 --> 01:20:05.867
CHARGE I THINK THAT'S WHY

01:20:05.934 --> 01:20:08.103
THEY'RE THERE TO DO SO. SIDE

01:20:08.170 --> 01:20:08.904

01:20:08.970 --> 01:20:10.572
WHAT'S WHAT IT IS THAT- IF YOU

01:20:10.639 --> 01:20:12.040

ADDRESS THESE OTHER ISSUES-

01:20:15.043 --> 01:20:16.745

01:20:29.624 --> 01:20:31.359
VALID CONCERNS LIKE OUR BILL IS

01:20:31.426 --> 01:20:33.628
NOT TO MAKE IT SO THAT. BURKE

01:20:33.695 --> 01:20:35.230
OWNERS CAN NO LONGER RECUPERATE

01:20:35.297 --> 01:20:36.831
FAIRLY THE COSTS OF UP KEEPING

01:20:36.898 --> 01:20:37.933
WATER INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S NOT

01:20:37.999 --> 01:20:39.234
THE GOAL OF THE BILL. I THINK

01:20:39.301 --> 01:20:40.168
THE AMENDMENTS THAT WE WORKED

01:20:40.235 --> 01:20:41.203
ON WITH THE COMMITTEE MAKE IT

01:20:41.269 --> 01:20:42.804
MUCH MORE CLEAR IN THAT. IN

01:20:42.871 --> 01:20:43.805
THAT REGARD. WE WORK WITH THE

01:20:43.872 --> 01:20:45.674

INDIVIDUALS OVER THE LAST

01:23:26.301 --> 01:23:28.737
DECADE FOR SOME PEOPLE THEY

01:23:51.526 --> 01:23:53.528
DEVASTATING IMAGES THAT YOU

01:23:53.595 --> 01:23:55.397
COULD SEE ACROSS THE WORLD

01:23:55.463 --> 01:23:56.798
WHICH ARE LITERALLY PEOPLE

01:23:56.865 --> 01:23:59.134
LYING ON THE STREETS. SOME WITH

01:23:59.200 --> 01:24:00.902
THE SLEEPING BAG SOME WITH

01:24:00.969 --> 01:24:03.772
NOTHING AROUND THEM AND SOME WE

01:24:03.838 --> 01:24:06.307
DON'T EVEN KNOW MENTALLY IF

01:24:06.374 --> 01:24:08.676
THEY ARE ALIVE OR NOT.

01:24:08.743 --> 01:24:10.311
LITERALLY UNLESS WE GO UP TO

01:24:10.378 --> 01:24:12.814
THEM. AND CHECK. AND THIS IS

01:24:12.881 --> 01:24:15.216
HERE IN SACRAMENTO. THIS IS NOT

01:24:15.283 --> 01:24:17.952
EXCLUSIVE TO SACRAMENTO IT'S

01:24:18.019 --> 01:24:19.854
ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

01:24:19.921 --> 01:24:22.090
AND SO THE CONTEXT OF THIS BILL

01:24:22.157 --> 01:24:26.628
CAME. TO ME LAST SESSION WHEN

01:24:26.694 --> 01:24:28.496
IN MY HOMETOWN OF FULLER TEN.

01:24:28.563 --> 01:24:31.065
THE LA PAZ MOBILE HOME WAS

01:24:31.132 --> 01:24:35.270
BOUGHT BY OF. OWNER A NEW OWNER

01:24:35.336 --> 01:24:37.739
AND RENTS WERE RAISED CLOSE

01:24:37.806 --> 01:24:40.975
219% THIS PARTICULAR MOBILE

01:24:41.042 --> 01:24:44.145
HOME PARK SITS ON LAND IN

01:24:44.212 --> 01:24:46.147
FULLERTON AND ANAHEIM SO IT WAS

01:24:46.214 --> 01:24:49.951
BOTH. CITIES ISSUE THERE WAS A

01:24:50.018 --> 01:24:51.920
LOT OF DISCUSSION AT THE LOCAL

01:24:51.986 --> 01:24:53.721
CITY COUNCIL OF WHAT COULD BE

01:24:53.788 --> 01:24:55.890
DONE AND HERE AT THE STATE WE

01:24:55.957 --> 01:24:58.326
WERE IN FACT LOOKING AT A RANGE

01:24:58.393 --> 01:25:02.630
RENT STABILIZATION BILL AB

01:25:02.697 --> 01:25:03.231
FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO I BELIEVE

01:25:03.298 --> 01:25:05.567
THAT'S THE RIGHT NUMBER. THAT

01:25:05.633 --> 01:25:07.869
BILL DID PASS BUT MOBILE HOMES

01:25:07.936 --> 01:25:10.171
WERE NOT INCLUDED IN IT. LAST

01:25:10.238 --> 01:25:12.740
YEAR WE WORKED TIRELESSLY TO

01:25:12.807 --> 01:25:14.509
TRY TO BRING FORWARD SOME TYPE

01:25:14.576 --> 01:25:18.112
OF. SOLUTION FOR THE THIS NOT

01:25:18.179 --> 01:25:20.215
ONLY THIS MOBILE HOME BUT

01:25:20.281 --> 01:25:20.715
THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF

01:25:20.782 --> 01:25:23.618
CALIFORNIA. WE HAVE PEOPLE UP

01:25:23.685 --> 01:25:25.220
HERE WHO DO THEIR JOBS WELL

01:25:25.286 --> 01:25:26.488
WHETHER THEY'RE ASSEMBLYMEMBERS

01:25:26.554 --> 01:25:28.590
OR LOBBYISTS AND MANY OF THE

01:25:28.656 --> 01:25:29.657
PEOPLE THAT ARE OPPOSED TO MY

01:25:29.724 --> 01:25:32.026
BILL ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE DOING

01:25:32.093 --> 01:25:34.462
AN EXCELLENT JOB ADVOCATING FOR

01:25:34.529 --> 01:25:35.997
THE PEOPLE THEY REPRESENT THEY

01:25:36.064 --> 01:25:38.366
REPRESENT. WHETHER THEY BE THE

01:25:38.433 --> 01:25:40.768
MOBILE HOME OWNERS AND MY JOB

01:25:40.835 --> 01:25:42.103
IS TO ADVOCATE FOR THE PEOPLE

01:25:42.170 --> 01:25:44.138
IN MY COMMUNITY AND TO DO

01:25:44.205 --> 01:25:46.608
EVERYTHING I CAN. EVERYTHING I

01:25:46.674 --> 01:25:48.843
CAN TO TRY TO KEEP PEOPLE WHO

01:25:48.910 --> 01:25:51.613
ARE HOUSED HOUSE WE ALREADY

01:25:51.679 --> 01:25:53.648
HAVE AN ISSUE OF THOSE WHO ARE

01:25:53.715 --> 01:25:55.450
NOT HOUSED AND WE ARE

01:25:55.517 --> 01:25:57.552
STRUGGLING WE SAT HERE FOR

01:25:57.619 --> 01:26:00.054
HOURS ON THURSDAY WITH SO MANY

01:26:00.121 --> 01:26:02.223
BILLS TRYING TO FIND SOLUTIONS

01:26:02.290 --> 01:26:03.791
AND YET WHEN WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO

01:26:03.858 --> 01:26:06.127
ARE HOUSED WE STILL DON'T HAVE

01:26:06.194 --> 01:26:08.263
A SOLUTION TO KEEP THEM HOUSED.

01:26:08.329 --> 01:26:11.032
SO MY BILL IT IS NOT A SIMPLE

01:26:11.099 --> 01:26:13.401
BILL IT'S COMPLEX I KNOW

01:26:13.468 --> 01:26:14.469
SOMETIMES WE SAY IT'S JUST A

01:26:14.536 --> 01:26:16.137
SIMPLE BILL AND THE TRUTH IS

01:26:16.204 --> 01:26:18.239
THIS ISN'T A SIMPLE BILL IT IS

01:26:18.306 --> 01:26:20.508
A DIFFICULT SUBJECT WE'RE

01:26:20.575 --> 01:26:21.609
PASSIONATE PEOPLE ON BOTH

01:26:21.676 --> 01:26:24.979

THOSE AMENDMENTS- THIS BILL WAS

01:26:39.427 --> 01:26:40.895

HOME OWNERS ARE ALSO FACING

01:27:03.384 --> 01:27:05.420
DRASTIC RENT INCREASES FROM

01:28:16.891 --> 01:28:19.193
INCREASE AS YOU CAN IMAGINE AND

01:28:19.260 --> 01:28:21.129
DO THE MATH THAT IS SOMETHING

01:28:21.195 --> 01:28:23.064
THAT IS BEYOND THEIR SOCIAL

01:28:23.131 --> 01:28:28.603
SECURITY. SO IN SHORT. I'VE

01:28:28.670 --> 01:28:30.872
INTRODUCED TO THIS BILL FOR

01:28:30.938 --> 01:28:32.040
RENT STABILIZATION BUT I'VE

01:28:32.106 --> 01:28:35.476
NARROWED IT. SO INSTEAD OF IT

01:28:35.543 --> 01:28:37.745
APPLYING TO THE ENTIRE STATE IT

01:28:37.812 --> 01:28:40.948
WOULD APPLY TO. MOBILE HOME

01:28:41.015 --> 01:28:42.550
PARKS THAT AREN'T WHO

01:28:42.617 --> 01:28:44.719
JURISDICTIONS AS WELL AS FAR AS

01:28:44.786 --> 01:28:46.888
WE KNOW FULLERTON AND ANAHEIM

01:28:46.954 --> 01:28:49.323
ARE THE ONLY ONES BUT I BELIEVE

01:28:49.390 --> 01:28:50.858
WE THERE ARE A FEW OTHR

01:28:50.925 --> 01:28:53.061
EXAMPLES THAT THE OPPOSITION

01:28:53.127 --> 01:28:54.829
WILL NOTE TODAY WE HAVEN'T BEEN

01:28:54.896 --> 01:28:57.031
GIVEN THAT INFORMATION BUT I DO

01:28:57.098 --> 01:28:58.766
WANT TO BE FAIR THIS IS FOR

01:28:58.833 --> 01:29:02.904
MOBILE HOME. PARKS THAT ARE IN

01:29:02.970 --> 01:29:03.438
TWO JURISDICTIONS THAT ARE

01:29:03.504 --> 01:29:07.341
CONNECTED. SO IN OUR CASE. WE

01:29:07.408 --> 01:29:08.910
HAVE FULLERTON AND ANAHEIM AND

01:29:08.976 --> 01:29:11.579
IT'S THEY RUN ACROSS CITY LINES

01:29:11.646 --> 01:29:13.347
BUT THERE COULD BE A FEW MORE

01:29:13.414 --> 01:29:14.882
BUT THAT IS THE NARROWING OF

01:29:14.949 --> 01:29:16.584
THE BILL THE NARROWING IS TO

01:29:16.651 --> 01:29:19.320
APPLY TO THIS VERSUS THE ENTIRE

01:29:19.387 --> 01:29:21.489
STATE AS WE BROUGHT FORWARD.

01:29:21.556 --> 01:29:23.591
LAST YEAR. BEEN A VERY

01:29:23.658 --> 01:29:26.294
DIFFICULT PROCESS I WILL COMMIT

01:29:26.360 --> 01:29:27.628
TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THE

01:29:27.695 --> 01:29:30.298
OPPOSITION BUT LET ME BE CLEAR

01:29:30.364 --> 01:29:31.799
THE OPPOSITION THAT WE HAVE

01:29:31.866 --> 01:29:33.801
TODAY IS THE OPPOSITION WE HAD

01:29:33.868 --> 01:29:38.206
LAST YEAR. AND SIMPLY STATED I

01:29:38.272 --> 01:29:39.240
DON'T KNOW THAT THERE WILL BE

01:29:39.307 --> 01:29:41.943
ANYTHING THAT WE CAN DO TO GET.

01:29:42.009 --> 01:29:43.377
THE OPPOSITION REMOVED BECAUSE

01:29:43.444 --> 01:29:45.446
THAT IS THEIR JOB. AND I

01:29:45.513 --> 01:29:46.681
UNDERSTAND THAT THEY'RE DOING

01:29:46.748 --> 01:29:48.916
IT EXTREMELY WELL SO I WILL

01:29:48.983 --> 01:29:50.852
STOP THERE AND INNER DO SO OUR

01:29:50.918 --> 01:29:54.155

01:43:33.507 --> 01:43:35.375
THIS IS A SUPPLY AND DEMAND

01:43:35.442 --> 01:43:37.544
ISSUE AND FINANCIAL WE HAVE IN

01:43:37.611 --> 01:43:39.546
CALIFORNIA AND IT'S HUGE AND

01:43:39.613 --> 01:43:42.516
IT'S OUR OWN MAKING YEARS YEARS

01:43:42.583 --> 01:43:45.152
YEARS IN THE MAKING. AND SO

01:43:45.218 --> 01:43:46.687
THESE TYPE OF THINGS ARE GOING

01:43:46.753 --> 01:43:48.088
TO NECESSARILY SOLVE THE

01:43:48.155 --> 01:43:50.357
PROBLEMS ARE JUST BANDAIDS THAT

01:43:50.424 --> 01:43:50.958
WERE THROWN OUT TRYING TO HELP

01:43:51.024 --> 01:43:53.594
PEOPLE- YOU KNOW IT IN THIS

01:43:53.660 --> 01:43:55.329
PARTICULAR CASE I YOU KNOW I

01:43:55.395 --> 01:43:57.230
REALLY FEEL LIKE. THE LOCAL

01:43:57.297 --> 01:43:59.833
AGENCIES NEEDED YOU KNOW STEP

01:43:59.900 --> 01:44:03.437
UP AND HELP THOSE PEOPLE- WHEN

01:44:03.503 --> 01:44:05.339
SOMEBODY COMES IN AND DOES A

01:44:05.405 --> 01:44:07.474
19% INCREASE IN THEIR RANTS.

01:44:07.541 --> 01:44:08.609
YOU KNOW THAT SOMETHING FOR

01:44:08.675 --> 01:44:09.710
THAT'S WHAT THOSE WE'RE GONNA

01:44:09.776 --> 01:44:11.445
PUT THE LOCAL PEOPLE TO WORK

01:44:11.511 --> 01:44:13.513
CITY COUNCIL PEOPLE ARE USED TO

01:44:13.580 --> 01:44:16.416
BE ONE OF THEM- THAT'S OUR JOB.

01:44:16.483 --> 01:44:18.986
AND SO AND THAT'S THE PROBLEM

01:44:19.052 --> 01:44:20.721
WHEN I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE TRYING

01:44:20.787 --> 01:44:22.623
TO NARROW THIS DOWN STEP BUT

01:44:22.689 --> 01:44:24.291
IT'S STILL KIND OF A BLANKET

01:44:24.358 --> 01:44:27.060
APPROACH. ARE THEY CAN BE. IT

01:44:27.127 --> 01:44:28.662
CAN BE PRETTY BACKED BY

01:44:28.729 --> 01:44:30.330
SOMEBODY ELSE ON TO IT AND

01:44:30.397 --> 01:44:32.199
THAT'S I GUESS THAT'S REALLY

01:44:32.265 --> 01:44:34.601
JUST WHAT MY CONCERN IS- WE

01:44:34.668 --> 01:44:36.236
NEED THE LOCAL PEOPLE TO STEP

01:44:36.303 --> 01:44:37.904
UP FOR AND OUR JOB IS TO FIGURE

01:44:37.971 --> 01:44:39.906
OUT WHAT WE DID WRONG. TO

01:44:39.973 --> 01:44:40.974
CREATE A SUPPLY AND DEMAND

01:44:41.041 --> 01:44:43.210
BECAUSE WE CREATED A MONSTER

01:44:43.276 --> 01:44:48.615
PROBLEM IN THE SUPPLY SIDE WE.

01:44:48.682 --> 01:44:49.683
NEED TO FIX IT. THANK YOU. ANY

01:44:49.750 --> 01:44:50.984
OTHER COMMENTS. I'M JUST GONNA

01:44:51.051 --> 01:44:53.120
SAY TO THAT FOR A MOMENT- I

01:44:53.186 --> 01:44:54.888
THINK EVERYONE IN THIS

01:44:54.955 --> 01:44:55.822
COMMITTEE UNDERSTANDS WE HAVE A

01:44:55.889 --> 01:44:57.691
SUPPLY DEMAND PROBLEM- THE

01:44:57.758 --> 01:44:59.660
CHALLENGES WE ARE WE ARE AND

01:44:59.726 --> 01:45:01.094
WE'RE TRYING TO AVOID MASS

01:45:01.161 --> 01:45:02.562
EVICTIONS AND WHAT WE DID A

01:45:02.629 --> 01:45:04.998
COUPLE YEARS AGO WITH AB

01:45:05.065 --> 01:45:05.599
FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO WHAT WE'VE

01:45:05.666 --> 01:45:07.968
DONE AND THIS PANDEMIC AS FAR

01:45:08.035 --> 01:45:08.902
AS PROVIDING EVICTION

01:45:08.969 --> 01:45:10.804
PROTECTIONS AS WE SAID WE HAVE

01:45:10.871 --> 01:45:12.406
A SUPPLY DEMAND PROBLEM BUT IN

01:45:12.472 --> 01:45:14.207
THE MEANTIME WE NEED TO FIGURE

01:45:14.274 --> 01:45:16.076
OUT. HOW WE PREVENT MASS

01:45:16.143 --> 01:45:18.612
EVICTIONS- CERTAINLY AGREE THAT

01:45:18.679 --> 01:45:20.047
LOCAL AGENCIES NEED TO STEP UP

01:45:20.113 --> 01:45:21.615
THERE THE REALITY IS WE'RE

01:45:21.682 --> 01:45:22.716
DOING THIS BECAUSE A LOT OF

01:45:22.783 --> 01:45:24.584
LOCAL AGENCIES HAVEN'T AND I

01:45:24.651 --> 01:45:25.485
BELIEVE I DON'T WANNA SPEAK FOR

01:45:25.552 --> 01:45:27.087
THE AUTHOR- BUT THE FACT THAT

01:45:27.154 --> 01:45:28.789

THOSE JURISDICTIONS AND WE CAN

01:45:41.301 --> 01:45:41.802
