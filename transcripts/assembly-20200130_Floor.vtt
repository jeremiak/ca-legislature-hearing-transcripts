I HAVE AND I THINK THAT'S

01:03:15.158 --> 01:03:15.825
SOMETHING WE HAVE TO BE VERY

01:03:15.892 --> 01:03:18.728
CAREFUL OF. AS I READ THE BILL.

01:03:18.794 --> 01:03:20.530
AS WE STEP TO PREVENT TO MAKE

01:03:20.596 --> 01:03:22.632
SURE THAT. COUNCIL MEMBERS

01:03:22.698 --> 01:03:24.133

01:03:28.638 --> 01:03:29.839
SOME OF THE EXEMPTIONS ARE

01:03:29.906 --> 01:03:31.574
PROVIDED IN THERE AND THE ONE

01:03:31.641 --> 01:03:32.742
THAT WORRIES ME THE MOST IS

01:03:32.808 --> 01:03:35.144
ABOUT THE DIGITAL ICONS. IF WE

01:03:35.211 --> 01:03:36.879
ARE SETTING UP THE POSSIBILITY.

01:03:36.946 --> 01:03:38.648
WHERE I COULD AS A LOCAL

01:03:38.714 --> 01:03:41.117
ELECTED POST SOMETHING. ON THE

01:03:41.184 --> 01:03:41.884
INTERNET ABOUT IT AND ITEM THAT

01:03:41.951 --> 01:03:44.320
I HAVE. AND THEN RELY ON THE

01:03:44.387 --> 01:03:46.889
LAKES FROM MY COLLEAGUES. WHICH

01:03:46.956 --> 01:03:48.424
MY READING THE BILL CURRENTLY

01:03:48.491 --> 01:03:51.160
SEEMS TO ALLOW. THEN THAT

01:03:51.227 --> 01:03:53.462
SHOULD BE A VIOLATION OF THE

01:03:53.529 --> 01:03:55.431
BROWN ACT BECAUSE NOW I HAVE

01:03:55.498 --> 01:03:55.998
COLLECTED VOTES A LITTLE BIT

01:03:56.065 --> 01:04:00.603
SURREPTITIOUSLY. SOCIAL MEDIA-PLATFORMS ARE NOT UBIQUITOUS

01:04:00.670 --> 01:04:01.971
AND NOT ALL MEMBERS OF THE

01:04:02.038 --> 01:04:03.573
PUBLIC ARE CONNECTED ON THE

01:04:03.639 --> 01:04:05.474
SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS. SO IT

01:04:05.541 --> 01:04:07.176
IS NOT AN APPROPRIATE PLACE TO

01:04:07.243 --> 01:04:08.311
SAY WE CHECK THAT BOX BECAUSE

01:04:08.377 --> 01:04:09.545
IT IS PUBLIC DISCOURSE IT IS

01:04:09.612 --> 01:04:11.180
NOT PUBLIC DISCOURSE EVEN IF IT

01:04:11.247 --> 01:04:13.349
IS A SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM THAT

01:04:13.416 --> 01:04:15.184
IS FAIRLY COMMONLY USE. SO I

01:04:15.251 --> 01:04:16.586
THINK WE DO NEED TO MODERNIZE

01:04:16.652 --> 01:04:18.421
AROUND ACT WE NEED TO ACCOUNT

01:04:18.487 --> 01:04:18.854
FOR MINOR TYPES OF

01:04:18.921 --> 01:04:20.923
COMMUNICATIONS HOWEVER. IF WE

01:04:20.990 --> 01:04:22.959
ARE ALLOWING EXEMPTIONS FOR

01:04:23.025 --> 01:04:24.760
CERTAIN TYPES OF ACTIVITY WE

01:04:24.827 --> 01:04:27.163
HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL ABOUT

01:04:27.230 --> 01:04:28.764
WHAT WE ALLOW DON'T ALLOW SO

01:04:28.831 --> 01:04:29.365
THAT WE ARE NOT WHICH I KNOW

01:04:29.432 --> 01:04:30.666
HE'S NOT YOUR TENSION. OPENING

01:04:30.733 --> 01:04:33.336

01:04:33.402 --> 01:04:35.504
COUNTER COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN

MEMBERS TO BUILD CONFIDENCE IN

01:04:37.506 --> 01:04:38.608

BASKETBALL. HIS FAVORITE PART

OF RETIRING WAS SPENDING TIME

01:27:26.874 --> 01:27:28.076
MAKING SURE THAT HIS POST

01:27:28.142 --> 01:27:29.477
CAREER FOOTPRINT WAS JUST AS

01:27:29.544 --> 01:27:31.312
IMPACTFUL AS A FOOTPRINT HE

01:27:31.379 --> 01:27:33.715
LEFT ON THE COURT. YOU KNOW

01:27:33.781 --> 01:27:34.349
IT'S INTERESTING WHEN WE TALK

01:27:34.415 --> 01:27:36.417
ABOUT. KOBE BRYANT AND HIS

01:27:36.484 --> 01:27:38.019
IMPACT UPON OTHER PEOPLE'S

01:27:38.086 --> 01:27:40.154
LIVES. AND TALKING WITH A YOUNG

01:27:40.221 --> 01:27:41.089
MAN HE SAID THERE WERE THREE

01:27:41.155 --> 01:27:43.291
THINGS HE WANTED TO DO IN LIFE.

01:27:43.358 --> 01:27:45.526
HE WANTED TO MEET OBAMA. HONOR

01:27:45.593 --> 01:27:47.595
TO MEET JZ. AND HE WANTED TO BE

01:27:47.662 --> 01:27:49.797
KOBE. THOSE ARE THE THREE THAT

01:27:49.864 --> 01:27:51.265
HE FELT WERE IMPACTFUL IN HIS

01:27:51.332 --> 01:27:53.434
LIFE AND I FOUND THAT TO BE

01:27:53.501 --> 01:27:55.203
QUITE INTERESTING. WHEN I SEE

01:27:55.269 --> 01:27:56.838
SOMETHING LIKE THIS IT HAPPENS

01:27:56.904 --> 01:27:57.905
IN DEATH IS JUST A PART OF

01:27:57.972 --> 01:27:59.574
LIFE. AND ANY OF US WHO THINK

01:27:59.641 --> 01:28:01.075
IT'S NOT WE'LL FIND OUT FAIRLY

01:28:01.142 --> 01:28:04.012
SOON. THAT I ALWAYS THINK ABOUT

01:28:04.078 --> 01:28:05.613
WHAT IS IN ME WHAT CAN WE LEARN

01:28:05.680 --> 01:28:07.215
FROM THIS BECAUSE THAT'S REALLY

01:28:07.281 --> 01:28:08.750
WHERE IT'S ALL ABOUT. WE CAN

01:28:08.816 --> 01:28:11.285
MOURN. WE CAN PROVIDE SUPPORT

01:28:11.352 --> 01:28:12.286
FOR FAMILIES WE CAN DO THOSE

01:28:12.353 --> 01:28:14.288
THINGS THAT THE HELP EASE THE

01:28:14.355 --> 01:28:15.590
PAIN BUT THE PAIN WILL BE THERE

01:28:15.657 --> 01:28:17.525
IF YOU'VE EVER LOST. A LOVED

01:28:17.592 --> 01:28:19.027
ONE IT WILL BE THERE AT ONLY

01:28:19.093 --> 01:28:20.795
TIME AND WORKING THROUGH IT

01:28:20.862 --> 01:28:22.664
WILL BASICALLY HELP YOU. WITH A

01:28:22.730 --> 01:28:23.998
LOT OF THINGS THAT WE LEARN IN

01:28:24.065 --> 01:28:25.600
THE PROCESS WHEN WE WHEN WE'RE

01:28:25.667 --> 01:28:27.201
CONFRONTED WITH DEATH. I'M

01:28:27.268 --> 01:28:29.203
REMINDED OFTENTIMES ABOUT

01:28:29.270 --> 01:28:31.139
METHUSELAH. THE BIBLE TELLS AS

01:28:31.205 --> 01:28:33.041
WITH LOSE A LIVE NINE HUNDRED

01:28:33.107 --> 01:28:34.876
AND SIXTY NINE YEARS. AND THEN

01:28:34.942 --> 01:28:38.012
DIED. THAT'S ALL WE HAVE IS A

01:28:38.079 --> 01:28:39.847
RECORD OF HIM. NO ACTIVITY. NO

01:28:39.914 --> 01:28:41.849
CONTRIBUTIONS. WE KNOW WHOSE

01:28:41.916 --> 01:28:44.318
FATHER WAS WHOSE CHILDREN WERE.

01:28:44.385 --> 01:28:46.187
BUT HE LIVE NINE HUNDRED AND

01:28:46.254 --> 01:28:47.722
SIXTY NINE YEARS ACCORDING TO

01:28:47.789 --> 01:28:49.590
THE SCRIPTURE. AND THEN DIED.

01:28:49.657 --> 01:28:50.958
AND I THINK ABOUT THAT BECAUSE

01:28:51.025 --> 01:28:52.627
THERE ARE SO MANY OF US WHO.

01:28:52.694 --> 01:28:54.896
WHO WILL ONLY LIVE THIRTY FORTY

01:28:54.962 --> 01:28:56.798
YEARS. AND YET THAT'S PERIOD IN

01:28:56.864 --> 01:28:58.666
BETWEEN BIRTH AND DEATH. IS

01:28:58.733 --> 01:29:01.035
FIELD. FEEL WITH THINGS THAT

01:29:01.102 --> 01:29:02.637
WE'VE ACCOMPLISHED. FEEL WHAT

01:29:02.704 --> 01:29:04.372
HOW WE MAKE PEOPLE FEEL. FILLED

01:29:04.439 --> 01:29:06.040
AT THINGS OF WHAT THEY DID IN

01:29:06.107 --> 01:29:07.175
OUR LIFE AND HOW WE SAW THEM

01:29:07.241 --> 01:29:09.010
AND THE IMPACT OF THEIR LIFE.

01:29:09.077 --> 01:29:11.312
WILL LIVE FOR EVER AND EVER

01:29:11.379 --> 01:29:13.081
BECAUSE IF NOT WHAT THEY DID

01:29:13.147 --> 01:29:13.748
BUT HOW THEY MADE YOU FEEL AS A

01:29:13.815 --> 01:29:16.117
HUMAN BEING. AND HOW THEY HELP

01:29:16.184 --> 01:29:17.151
YOU TO ACCOMPLISH YOUR GOALS.

01:29:17.218 --> 01:29:18.786
WHEN I THINK ABOUT SOMEBODY

01:29:18.853 --> 01:29:22.090
SAYS. CALL WAS LIFE ISTOO

01:29:22.156 --> 01:29:24.058
SHORT IT WAS UNTIMELY. AND

01:29:24.125 --> 01:29:27.628
ALWAYS. THE THING HOLES OF.

01:29:27.695 --> 01:29:28.730
WE'RE NOT CHARGE OF THE CLOCK

01:29:28.796 --> 01:29:30.131
SOME ELSE'S INTO OF THE CLOCK

01:29:30.198 --> 01:29:31.866
SO WE CALL IT UNTIMELY IT'S

01:29:31.933 --> 01:29:33.935
MAYBE OUR TIME BUT IT'S NOT THE

01:29:34.001 --> 01:29:36.270
REAL TIME BECAUSE ALL OF US DIE

01:29:36.337 --> 01:29:38.039
AT OUR TIME. AND SO IT'S

01:29:38.106 --> 01:29:39.474
IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT

01:29:39.540 --> 01:29:40.975
THAT WHILE WE GRIEVE ABOUT IT

01:29:41.042 --> 01:29:43.277
WE HAVE SO MUCH TO THINK ABOUT

01:29:43.344 --> 01:29:45.012
WHAT ARE WE DOING TO FIGHT FOR

01:29:45.079 --> 01:29:46.814
OUR DREAMS AS HE FOUGHT FOR

01:29:46.881 --> 01:29:48.116
HIS. WE DOING TO HELP OTHERS

01:29:48.182 --> 01:29:50.651
ACCOMPLISH DEIRDRE HE DID HOW

01:29:50.718 --> 01:29:52.286
WILL WE MAKE OUR LEGACY AN

01:29:52.353 --> 01:29:54.021
IMPORTANT LEGACY A LEGACY

01:29:54.088 --> 01:29:55.490
THAT'S ONLY FORTY ONE YEARS

01:29:55.556 --> 01:29:57.258
LONG AND YET MORE IMPACTFUL

01:29:57.325 --> 01:29:59.727
THAN SOMEONE WHO LIVED NINE

01:29:59.794 --> 01:30:01.195
HUNDRED AND SIXTY NINE YEARS. I

01:30:01.262 --> 01:30:02.563
WANT TO FEEL OF THE OTHER DAY

01:30:02.630 --> 01:30:03.164
OF A GENTLEMAN WHO WAS NINETY

01:30:03.231 --> 01:30:05.867
FOUR YEARS OLD. AND PEOPLE

01:30:05.933 --> 01:30:06.868
THEIR GRIEVED AS IF HE WERE

01:30:06.934 --> 01:30:08.636
FOURTEEN. BECAUSE HE STILL

01:30:08.703 --> 01:30:10.271
WORKED EVERY DAY TO MAKE A

01:30:10.338 --> 01:30:12.140
DIFFERENCE AND HE HAD PROJECTS

01:30:12.206 --> 01:30:13.674
HE WAS WORKING ON ANY HAD

01:30:13.741 --> 01:30:15.376
THINGS HE WAS GIVING PEOPLE AND

01:30:15.443 --> 01:30:16.944
HE WAS SHARING HIS HISTORY OF

01:30:17.011 --> 01:30:19.380
AFRICAN AMERICANS IN SAN DIEGO.

01:30:19.447 --> 01:30:20.882
AND SO WE GRIEVE FOR HIM AS IF

01:30:20.948 --> 01:30:22.083
HE WERE JUST A KID GETTING

01:30:22.150 --> 01:30:23.684
READY TO DO SOMETHING ELSE

01:30:23.751 --> 01:30:25.953
BECAUSE I ALWAYS WAS READY AND

01:30:26.020 --> 01:30:26.754
GETTING READY TO DO SOMETHING

01:30:26.821 --> 01:30:30.024
ELSE. WE GRIEVE FOR HIM AND HIS

01:30:30.091 --> 01:30:32.593
FAMILY BECAUSE WE KNOW NOT SO

01:30:32.660 --> 01:30:34.362
MUCH FOR HIM BUT HIS FAMILY.

01:30:34.428 --> 01:30:36.297
THE THING MESSED. HE WILL DANCE

01:30:36.364 --> 01:30:38.933
DOOR WEDDING. YOU WON'T WALKING

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:39.867
DOWN I. THESE ARE THINGS THAT

01:30:39.934 --> 01:30:41.469
MANY OF US HAVE X. IN OUR LIFE

01:30:41.536 --> 01:30:43.004
NOT BECAUSE THEY WERE FAMOUS

01:30:43.070 --> 01:30:43.738
BUT BECAUSE THOSE ARE THE

01:30:43.805 --> 01:30:45.439
THINGS THAT BRING US JOY BUT AT

01:30:45.506 --> 01:30:47.341
PURPOSE TO I'LL HAVE AND GIVE

01:30:47.408 --> 01:30:49.710
US A FOCUS IN LOOKING AT WHAT

01:30:49.777 --> 01:30:51.546
WE NEED TO DO. RIGHT I THINK OF

01:30:51.612 --> 01:30:52.713
THE FACT THAT. THE THING I

01:30:52.780 --> 01:30:53.948
WOULD MISS IS THE SECOND

01:30:54.015 --> 01:30:56.017
CHAPTER OF HIS LIFE. WE ALSO

01:30:56.083 --> 01:30:57.985
THE FIRST CHAPTER THE SPORTS.

01:30:58.052 --> 01:30:59.420
AND WE WANT TO KNOW WHAT THE

01:30:59.487 --> 01:31:00.588
SECOND CHAPTER WOULD LOOK LIKE

01:31:00.655 --> 01:31:01.589
AND YET HE GAVE US SOME

01:31:01.656 --> 01:31:03.791
EXAMPLES IN MANY WAYS OF HOW

01:31:03.858 --> 01:31:04.692
HARD HE WOULD WORK TO

01:31:04.759 --> 01:31:07.228
ACCOMPLISH HIS STRINGS. AND A

01:31:07.295 --> 01:31:07.762
HEART HE WILL WORK TO MAKE

01:31:07.829 --> 01:31:09.297
THINGS RIGHT. BUT HE ALSO GAVE

01:31:09.363 --> 01:31:11.933
US ANOTHER EXAMPLE MOST PEOPLE.

01:31:11.999 --> 01:31:12.533
THE MORNING BEFORE YOU GOT ON

01:31:12.600 --> 01:31:15.436
THE PLANE. AFTER HE WENT TO

01:31:15.503 --> 01:31:17.839
CHURCH AND HE PRAYED. AND I

01:31:17.905 --> 01:31:19.440
THOUGHT TO MYSELF HE KNEW WHO

01:31:19.507 --> 01:31:21.008
WAS IN CONTROL OF THE UNIVERSE

01:31:21.075 --> 01:31:22.910
NOT KOBE BRYANT NOT THE

01:31:22.977 --> 01:31:24.612
HELICOPTER DRIVER BUT THE

01:31:24.679 --> 01:31:26.781
PERSON HE PRAYED TO. AND IT WAS

01:31:26.848 --> 01:31:29.016
HIS TIME IN MAY NOT OF BEEN

01:31:29.083 --> 01:31:31.052
HOURS BUT WAS HE IS AND THE

01:31:31.118 --> 01:31:32.653
MOST WE CAN TAKE FROM IT IS

01:31:32.720 --> 01:31:34.255
THAT ALL OF US USE EVERY MOMENT

01:31:34.322 --> 01:31:36.090
OF THE DAY TO THOSE THINGS WE

01:31:36.157 --> 01:31:38.626
KNOW ALL RIGHT TO NEVER DID

01:31:38.693 --> 01:31:39.227
LATE THE STATEMENT THAT I LOVE

01:31:39.293 --> 01:31:40.995
YOU. NEVER PLAY THE IMPORTANCE
