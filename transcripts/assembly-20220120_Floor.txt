HOUSE RESOLUTION SEVEN DAY BY SIMPLY MEMBERS OF OUR QUE HAN AND OTHERS IT RELATIVE TO REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE SOME OF OUR CAN YOU MAY OPEN THANK YOU MR SPEAKER AND MEMBERS TODAY I RISE TO COMMEMORATE THE FORTY NINTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE SEMINAL CASE ROE V. WADE. ROVI WADE GRANTED WOMEN THE RIGHT TO PRIVACY. THE RIGHT TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT HER OWN BODY. IT ON. THE FACT THAT WOMEN ROTONDA HUMAN BEINGS WITH THE INTELLIGENCE AND ABILITY TO DECIDE FOR THEMSELVES. WHEN AND IF THEY SHOULD GET REMAIN PREGNANT. AND TODAY AS WE HONOR THE FORTY NINTH ANNIVERSARY OF THIS IMPORTANT CASE. WE MUST REFLECT ON WHAT THE FUTURE MAY HOLD. WE STAND AT THE PRECIPICE OF THE MOMENT WHEN ROE V. WADE MAY NO LONGER BE INTACT. IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE ALONE A HUNDRED SIX ABORTION RESTRICTIONS HAVE BEEN ENACTED IN NINETEEN STATES AND TWELVE OF THOSE BAN ABORTIONS. THINK ABOUT THAT MEMBERS. I SINCE THE DAY I COULD BEAR CHILDREN THROUGH THE JOURNEY TO BECOME A MOTHER HAVE NEVER QUESTIONS WHETHER I WOULD MAKE THIS A DECISION ABOUT WHEN AND IF I WOULD GET A REMAIN PREGNANT. I ALWAYS DREAMT OF BEING A MOTHER. BUT MY JOURNEY TO MOTHERHOOD LIKE MANY WASN'T EASY I HAD THREE COMPLICATED PREGNANCIES BUT AS THE WHITE PRIVILEGE WOMAN WITH AMAZING HEALTH CARE I HAD A PROVIDER WHO ALONG EVERY STEP OF THE JOURNEY INSURED I KNEW IT WAS MY CHOICE WHAT WE WOULD DO. THAT SHE WOULD BE THERE FOR ME AND THAT WE WOULD MAKE THAT DECISION TOGETHER AND ALONE. AND I AM BLESSED NOW WITH THREE BEAUTIFUL CHILDREN. BUT I WAS ALSO BLESSED WITH THE ECONOMY TO MAKE THAT DECISION FOR MYSELF. AND AS I LOOK IN MY DAUGHTER'S EYES. AND I THINK ABOUT WHETHER SHE WILL HAVE THAT SAME RIGHT TO DECIDE HER OWN FUTURE MAY DEPEND ON WHERE SHE LIVES SOME DAY. IT MAKES ME SAD AND ANGRY AND A LOT MORE WORDS THAT ARE NOT APPROPRIATE FOR THIS GREEN CARPET. BUT SO TODAY I WANT TO HONOR THE WORK THAT LED TO ROE V. WADE GAVE WOMEN THAT RIGHT THAT I HAVE ENJOYED MY ENTIRE LIFE. BUT I ALSO ASK YOU TO LOOK TO THE FUTURE AND WHAT YOUR ROLE IS IN THAT FUTURE. FOR EVERY GIRL AND EVERY WOMAN AND EVERY PERSON WHO MAY BECOME PREGNANT. WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO TO STAND UP FOR THE ECONOMY THE EQUITY THAT WOMEN HAVE FOUGHT SO HARD FOR. THE GAINS WE HAVE ACHIEVED THAT ARE NOW ON THE LINE AS WE LOOK AT ROE V. WADE. NO LONGER BEING INTACT NEXT YEAR AT THIS TIME. I WHEN I THINK MY CO AUTHORS ON THIS RESOLUTION THE WOMEN'S CAUCUS. AND IT'S ALL OF YOU WHO FIGHT ALONGSIDE ALL OF US WHO STAND UP FOR WOMEN IN REPRODUCTIVE CHOICE. BECAUSE NOT ONE OF US CAN DO THIS ALONE BUT TOGETHER WE CAN ENSURE THE CALIFORNIA REMAINS A BEACON OF HOPE FOR WOMEN. BECAUSE WHAT IS ON THE LINE IS NOT ONLY OUR EQUITY OUR INTEGRITY AND OUR INDEPENDENCE. BUT THE SAFETY AND HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF WOMEN WHO WILL MAKE THIS DECISION NO MATTER WHAT THE LAW SAYS. THANK YOU MISTER CAN. IS A MEMBER GARCIA RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MEMBERS I RISE IN SUPPORT OF HR SEVENTY EIGHT ARE COMMEMORATING THE FORTY NINTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT DECISION IN ROE VERSUS WADE AFFIRMING EVERY INDIVIDUAL HAS A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TO CONTROL THEIR OWN REPRODUCTIVE DECISIONS. AND WHETHER TO CONTINUE YOUR PREGNANCY OR OBTAIN AN ABORTION. IN NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE PRIOR TO ROE VERSUS WADE DECISION LACK OF ACCESS TO SAFE AND LEGAL ABORTION BECAUSE PREGNANT PEOPLE THEIR HEALTH AND THEIR LIVES. THE COUNTING APPROXIMATELY 70% OF ALL REPORTED THAT TO TREATED TO PREGNANCY AND CHILDBIRTH. AND MANY WERE SEVERELY INJURED AS A RESULT OF UNSAFE ABORTION PROCEDURES. RIVER SURVEYS WITH A VICTORY FOR PEOPLE TO OWN THEIR OWN BODIES AND LAID THE GROUNDWORK FOR THE REPRODUCTIVE AND SEXUAL HEALTH CARE POLICIES. THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. BUT TODAY IT'S BEING CHALLENGED IN THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT. AND AT RISK OF BEING TURNED OR SEVERELY ERODED. THROUGHOUT MY COLLEGE EDUCATION I WAS ON BIRTH CONTROL. I PURSUED MY STUDIES I HAD TO RELY ON IT. BECAUSE OF PRIVACY COULD HAVE MEANT THAT THE MY STRUGGLE TO ACHIEVE I'M LUCKY THAT I HAVE ACCESS TO THESE ARE TO POTENTIAL INVEST OUR SCHOOLS- HEALTH CENTER. I PERSONALLY KNOW FROM STATISTICS FROM MY HOMETOWN THAT THE STRUGGLE ESPECIALLY SEVERE FOR WOMEN OF COLOR. MY OWN ALMA MATER BILL CLINTON SAY SCHOOL HAD AND STILL HAS ONE OF THE HIGHEST TEEN PREGNANCY RATES IN CALIFORNIA. I REFUSE TO BE THAT THE STATISTICS AND I DON'T WANT THAT FOR OTHER WOMEN. TOO MANY YOUNG WOMEN AND GIRLS BECOME PREGNANT. NOT BECAUSE THEY CHOOSE OF A BECAUSE THEY ARE THE NIGHTS ALSO PREVENTS IT. ABSTINENCE IS NOT A FULL IT'S AN UNREALISTIC AND DANGEROUS EXPERIMENTS. EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE EQUAL ACCESS TO REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE. AND YET WOMEN OF COLOR IMMIGRANTS. LGBTQ PLUS COMMUNITY ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO IDENTIFY. OF THE DENNY'S INTERSECT AND DISPROPORTIONATELY ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED BY RESTRICTIONS ON THAT CARE. FOUR IF I HADN'T GONE TO COLLEGE I WOULD HAVE HAD ACCESS TO ANY LIKE HER ON EITHER OR THAT WE CONTROL THAT ALLOWED ME TO CONTINUE MY STUDIES THIS IS A REALITY FOR A LOT OF THE PEOPLE BACK HOME FOR ME. FOR MANY THE LACK OF ACCESS COULD BE DUE TO SOCIAL STRUCTURAL FACTORS SUCH AS FEWER NEIGHBORHOOD HEALTH. SERVICES LESS INSURANCE COVERAGE INCREASED ACCESS TO EDUCATIONAL AND ECONOMIC ATTAINMENT. EVEN PRACTICED ON OVER FACTORS SUCH AS RACIAL BIAS AND STEREOTYPING PERSON'S RIGHT TO CONTROL THEIR OWN DESTINY WHATEVER INSURING THAT OUR MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES HAVE ACCESS IT'S ABOUT EQUITY. THE REALITY IS THAT IN THOSE STATES WHERE THIS IS BEING CHALLENGED AND PROBABLY GOING TO BE OVERTURNED. IF YOU HAVE THE MEANS YOU'RE GOING TO FIND THE HEALTH CARE THAT YOU NEED IT'S EVERYONE ELSE THAT'S GOING TO BE LEFT BEHIND COMMUNITIES LIKE MINE THAT ARE GOING TO BE LEFT BEHIND. H. R. SEVENTY EIGHT SOLIDIFIES THE ASSEMBLY SUPPORTING COMMITMENT TO PROTECT THE PERSON FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT. TO SAID IF AND WHEN THEY BECOME PREGNANT. I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. THANK YOU MR GARCIA. ASSEMBLY MEMBER WHATEVER YOU'RE RECOGNIZED. GOOD MORNING MISTER SPEAKER I RISE THIS MORNING IN STRONG SUPPORT OF HR SEVENTY EIGHT THAT MARKS THE FORTY NINTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT'S LANDMARK DECISION ROE V. WADE. THIS SHOULD BE A TIME OF CELEBRATION. CELEBRATING THE FACT HE NINE YEARS AGO WE AFFIRM THAT EVERYONE HAS THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TO CONTROL THEIR OWN REPRODUCTIVE DECISION THAT THE DECISION TO CONTINUE OR NOT CONTINUE A PREGNANCY IS SACRED. PERSONAL AND SHOULD NOT BE MADE FOR A WOMAN BY LAWYERS NOR POLITICIANS. FORTY NINE YEARS AGO WE AFFIRMED THAT REGARDLESS OF YOUR RACE OR SOCIO ECONOMIC STATUS THAT ALL WOMEN SHOULD HAVE ACCESS THE SAME ACCESS AND OPTIONS FOR THE REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH. BUT UNFORTUNATELY THE ACKNOWLEDGEMENT AND CELEBRATION OF THE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS BE MADE FORTY NINE YEARS AGO. IS BEING OVERSHADOWED BY THE VERY REAL AND SERIOUS THREAT OF IT BEING OVERTURNED BY THE SUPREME COURT. LEAVING AT LEAST THIRTY SIX MILLION WOMEN NEARLY HALF WOMEN OF REPRODUCTIVE AGE IN THE UNITED STATES. ACROSS TWENTY SIX STATES. WITHOUT ACCESS TO ABORTION. AS AN OBGYN I HAVE COUNSELED AND MANAGED MANY PATIENTS WITH INTENDED AND UNINTENDED PREGNANCIES. THOSE WHO DESIRE TO CONTINUE WITH THE PREGNANCY AND THOSE WHO DESIRE TO TERMINATE THEIR PREGNANCY. AND I CAN TELL YOU. THESE DECISIONS ARE NEVER EASY FOR ANY WOMAN. BUT THE REALITY IS THAT IT IS HER BODY AND HER CHOICE. BEFORE I MOVED BACK TO THIS GREAT STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I WAS ACTUALLY PRACTICING IN TEXAS. ONE OF THE REASONS WHY I LEFT IS BECAUSE AS A REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH PHYSICIAN AND A WOMAN. WHOSE HARD TO PRACTICE IN THE STATE. THAT DID NOT RESPECT OUR REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS AND WAS CONSTANTLY SWIPING STRIPPING AWAY OUR ACCESS AND OUR POWER OUR OWN BODIES. WE ARE LOOKING IN CALIFORNIA THAT DESPITE WHAT THE SUPREME COURT MAY DO WE WILL STAY STEADFAST TO THE AFFIRMATIONS WE MADE AS A COUNTRY FORTY NINE YEARS AGO. BUT WE MUST NOT FORGET ABOUT THOSE WOMEN WHO LIVE IN THE TWENTY SIX STATES THAT MAY SOON LOSE THEIR RIGHTS TO EASILY ACCESS SAFE AND LEGAL ABORTION. IN A TIME WHERE WE ACKNOWLEDGE THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING EQUALITY AND EQUITY AND HEALTH CARE. WE MUST ALSO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT INCLUDES ACCESS TO LEGAL ABORTION. WITH TRAINED HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS AND SAFE CLEAN HEALTHCARE FACILITIES. AS OUR LEGISLATIVE BODY CELEBRATES THE FORTY NINTH ANNIVERSARY OF ROE V. WADE. I HOPE THAT WE WOULD ALL RECOGNIZE THAT NOW IS THE TIME TO READ THAT OURSELVES TO ENSURING THAT ALL INDIVIDUALS HAVE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE THEY NEED INCLUDING ABORTION SERVICES FUNDAMENTAL TO ACHIEVING POSITIVE HEALTH OUTCOMES. AND I AM DEEPLY COMMITTED TO EXPANDING ACCESS TO CARE AND PROTECTING REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM. I URGE AN AYE VOTE ON THIS MEASURE THANK YOU. THANK YOU DR WEBER. ASSEMBLY MEMBER WICKS YOU'RE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER- LIKE FROM SAN DIEGO- NOT ONLY AS A MEMBER BUT ALSO AS A PRACTITIONER IN THE SPACE AND HER VOICE- AS AN OBGYN I THINK IS CRITICAL ON THIS FLOOR. AND I THINK YOU ALL KNOW I HAVE BEEN VERY OPEN PUBLICLY ABOUT MY OWN EXPERIENCES WITH ABORTION MY FIRST FLOOR SPEECH WHEN I GOT TO THE ASSEMBLY WAS ABOUT THE ABORTION THAT I HAD WHEN I WAS TWENTY FIVE YEARS OLD. AND I WAS IN BETWEEN HOMES AND IN BETWEEN JOBS AND HAD PREGNANCY AND THE CARE THAT I SOUGHT AT PLANNED PARENTHOOD WHAT THAT MEANT TO ME IN THE FACT THAT THAT GAVE ME THE POWER TO MAKE THE BEST DECISION FOR MYSELF AND FOR MY LIFE. AND WHAT THAT HAS LED TO. I ALSO SPOKE. RECENTLY IN SEPTEMBER I TURNS OUT I WAS PREGNANT. I DIDN'T KNOW IT I STARTED HAVING PRETTY SEVERE CRAMPING HEAVY BLEEDING. I WAS ABLE TO GO TO THE DOCTOR PRETTY QUICKLY BECAUSE WE ARE HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND BECAUSE I'M AFFORD HEALTH CARE. AND IN ONE BREATH THE DOCTOR TOLD ME. YOU'RE PREGNANT YOU'RE HAVING A MISCARRIAGE. AND WE NEED TO DO A DNC NOW. WHICH IS AN ABORTION I NEEDED THAT CARE IMMEDIATELY TO HELP STOP THE BLEEDING FROM WHAT WAS HAPPENING. AND I SPEAK OPENLY AND PUBLICLY ABOUT THESE EXPERIENCES BECAUSE IT IS INCUMBENT UPON ALL OF US NOW IN THIS MOMENT IN TIME IN THIS COUNTRY TO USE OUR VOICE TO SPEAK OUT ABOUT WHAT IS HAPPENING ACROSS THIS COUNTRY. I GREW UP IN A TIME WHEN. I THOUGHT THIS DECISION HAD BEEN MADE FOR US. MY MOTHER AND MY GRANDMOTHER IN THE GENERATIONS BEFORE US HAD FOUGHT SO HARD TO ENSURE. THAT I HAD THE ABILITY TO MAKE THESE CHOICES FOR MYSELF TO MAKE THE BEST DECISION FOR MY LIFE. BUT YOU LOOK AT WHAT IS HAPPENING ACROSS THIS COUNTRY. AND THE RIGHTS THAT ARE BEING ERODED AWAY. AND IT IS NOT OKAY. AND SO WHILE YOU KNOW SOME SOME OF US ON THE FLOOR SO IT'S A RESOLUTION IS NON BINDING. ARE THESE THINGS JUST SYMBOLIC. ALL RIGHT NOW IT MEANS MORE THAN JUST A RESOLUTION IT MEANS THE DECLARATION OF OUR VALUES AS A STATE THAT WE ARE STANDING UP. AND SUPPORTING PEOPLE'S RIGHT TO DECIDE WHAT IS BEST FOR THEIR LIFE. SO THAT'S WHY I FEEL INCOME TO SPEAK TODAY TWICE SPEAK OUT ON THIS ISSUE EVERY OPPORTUNITY I CAN. BECAUSE WE HAVE TO SEND THIS MESSAGE TO THE REST OF THIS COUNTRY THAT HERE IN CALIFORNIA. WE CARE ABOUT PEOPLE MAKING THE BEST DECISION FOR THEMSELVES THAT WE EMPOWER PEOPLE TO MAKE THOSE DECISIONS. AND I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUE AND I URGE AN AYE VOTE. I URGE THAT YOU ALL STAND UP. WITH PEOPLE ACROSS THIS COUNTRY AND SAY. NOT NOW. NOT HERE IN CALIFORNIA. WE STAND UP FOR PEOPLE FOR WHAT THEY BELIEVE IN THE BUILDING TO MAKE THEIR CHOICES. RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MS WICKS. ASSEMBLY MEMBER BONTA YOUR RECOGNIZING YOUR DESK. THANK YOU SO MUCH COLLEAGUES I ALSO URGE AN AYE VOTE ON THIS AND THANK YOU TO MY SISTER COLLEAGUES FOR SPEAKING THEIR TRUTH IN THIS MOMENT. I FOUND MYSELF AT SIXTEEN YEARS OLD STANDING WITH MY MOTHER. IN WASHINGTON DC LEARNING HOW TO PROTEST. FOR WOMEN'S RIGHTS THE PHONE. AND HAVE FULL OWNERSHIP DESPITE GOVERNMENT OVER THEIR BODIES. WE STOOD THERE I LEARNED TO PROTEST I LEARNED TO RECOGNIZE THAT MY BODY WAS MY BODY AND NOT THE GOVERNMENT. I SAY THIS AS A BLACK LATIN AS A PORTER RICAN WHO HAD THE U. S. LITERALLY. THEIR ALLIES ARE WOMEN. WE STOOD THERE I WAS PROUD I WAS PROUD OF THE PEOPLE THAT CAME TOGETHER TO MAKE SURE THAT WE COULD STAND FOR ROBI WAY. I FOUND MYSELF FIVE YEARS LATER LOOKING UP AT THE CEILING. WITH A DOCTOR HOLDING MY HANDS. AND TELLING ME THAT I WAS ABOUT TO GO THROUGH A PROCEDURE THAT WOULD HURT BUT THAT WAS BY CHOICE ALONE. AT TWENTY ONE. JUST HAVING GRADUATED. FROM YALE COLLEGE BREAKING THE POP OF THE POVERTY CYCLEFOR NOT ONLY MY IMMEDIATE FAMILY FOR THE ENTIRE FAMILY. BOB MYSELF HAVING TO MAKE A CHOICE. BETWEEN BEING ABLE TO HAVE ECONOMIC SECURITY. AND A PATHWAY TO BE ABLE TO GET A JOB WITH A DEGREE THAT I HAD JUST GOTTEN. OR SOMETHING ELSE AND PUTTING ANOTHER BURDEN ON MY MOTHER OF A DIFFERENT SORT. AND SO I MADE THE CHOICE TO SEEK AN ABORTION. THAT PREGNANCY WAS ONE OF SEVEN. I HAD THREE MISCARRIAGES AND I HAVE THREE BEAUTIFUL CHILDREN. AND I'M THANKFUL FOR THE MEDICAL CARE SINCE SYSTEM THAT I WAS ABLE TO SEEK IN CONNECTICUT M. IN CALIFORNIA WHICH ALLOWED ME TO BE SECURE THAT I WOULDN'T BE CRIMINALIZED FOR MY DECISIONS. THAT WAY WOULDN'T BE CRIMINALIZED FOR MY PREGNANCY LOSS AND THAT I WOULD BE ABLE TO HAVE ACCESS AFFORDABLE ACCESS TO THE CARE THAT THEY NEEDED EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THOSE EXPERIENCES THIS MOMENT AND RECOGNIZE THE CALIFORNIA IT LITERALLY. THE LAST STAND FOR JUSTICE THE LAST STAND FIRST ENSURING THAT BLACK AND BROWN LEVINE AT API HOWEVER YOU ARE HAVE THE ABILITY TO ACCESS THE CARE THAT THEY SO DESERVE. THE LAST STAND TO RECOGNIZE. THAT A WOMAN'S BODY IS A WOMAN'S BODY. COLLEAGUES THIS IS THE MOST CRITICAL MOMENTS THAT WE ARE IN RIGHT NOW. JUSTICE ACROSS THE COUNTRY IS NOT ON OUR SIDE AND WHEN I SAY. CALIFORNIA IS A LAST STAND I HOPE THAT YOU TAKE THAT AND HEAR IT IN YOUR HEARTS. AND ACT ACCORDINGLY IN SUPPORTING THIS RESOLUTION AND EVERY SINGLE BILL THAT WILL BE BROUGHT BEFORE YOU. WITH MY SISTER ALLIES IN THE WOMEN'S CAUCUS AS OUR TOP PRIORITY SO RECOGNIZE. THAT HOW WE GO THIS COUNTRY HAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO PROTECT ITSELF. AS WOMEN IN DROVES WILL COME TO CALIFORNIA THE SEA CARE WE NEED TO BE THERE WITH THEM. I RESPECTFULLY ASK AN ADULT. THANK YOU MISS BONTA. SEEING NO OTHER MEMBERS WISHING TO DISCUSS THE MEASURE AS A MEMBER OF OUR CANYON CLOSE THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUES FOR SPEAKING SO INCREDIBLY POWERFULLY ABOUT THIS ISSUE AND THE IMPORTANCE IMPORTANCE TO THE COMMUNITIES OF COLOR THEY DON'T HAVE EQUITABLE HEALTHCARE TODAY BUT CONTINUE TO DESERVE ACCESS TO IT. I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO FOR USING HER SKILLS AND HER VOICE TO ENSURE THE WOMEN UNDER HER CARE HAVE THIS CHOICE COLLEAGUES FROM ALAMEDA AND OAKLAND FOR TELLING THEIR STORIES. BECAUSE THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS THAT THE DECISION FOR WOMEN ACROSS THIS NATION WHAT IT DID FOR COLLEAGUES. IT GAVE THEM A CHOICE A CHOICE IN WHAT THEIR FUTURE LOOKED LIKE. AND SOME MAY HAVE CHOSEN TO CONTINUE THE PREGNANCY AND SOME MAY HAVE CHOSEN ABORTION. AND EVERY ONE OF THOSE CHOICES DESERVES THE RESPECT THAT ROE V. WADE GRANTED IT.
