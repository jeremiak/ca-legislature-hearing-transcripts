00:09:33.839 --> 00:09:35.041
THE QUESTION I POSED TO EACH OF

00:09:35.107 --> 00:09:36.242

CRAZY EXISTED.

00:09:51.657 --> 00:09:53.359
AND THEN I ASKED WHAT THEY WISH

00:09:53.426 --> 00:09:55.861
THEY HAD KNOWN. ONE STUDENT AND

00:09:55.928 --> 00:09:57.530
IN PRODUCT DESIGN TOLD ME SHE'D

00:09:57.596 --> 00:09:59.398

AND UNDER STANDING OF THE

00:10:03.502 --> 00:10:04.704
CREATIVE INDUSTRIES WERE LIMITED

00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:07.440

00:10:14.413 --> 00:10:15.915
BUILT ON DESIGN.

00:10:15.982 --> 00:10:17.216
A SIMILAR SENTIMENT WAS SHARED

00:10:17.283 --> 00:10:18.584
BY ERICA AND TOY DESIGN WHO

00:10:18.651 --> 00:10:20.419
ALWAYS LOVE TOY STORES BUT NEVER

00:10:20.486 --> 00:10:22.288
THOUGHT OF THE PEOPLE BEHIND

00:10:22.355 --> 00:10:24.056

00:10:24.123 --> 00:10:25.558

WAS INTERESTED IN DOING OR

00:10:32.798 --> 00:10:33.966
MATTHEW HIS COLLEAGUES WHO SAID

MORE SPECIFICALLY I WISH I KNEW

00:10:36.168 --> 00:10:37.803
THAT MOTION DESIGN EXISTED.

00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:39.071
AND WITHIN MOTION DESIGNED THAT

00:10:39.138 --> 00:10:40.806
THERE IS A DIVERSITY OF STYLES

00:10:40.873 --> 00:10:42.775
TO WORK WITH AND WHEN I ASKED

00:10:42.842 --> 00:10:44.143

THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO

00:10:46.912 --> 00:10:49.215
UNDERSTAND EARLY THAT OUR IS NOT

00:10:49.281 --> 00:10:50.883
LIMITED TO SHOWING IN A GALLERY.

00:10:50.950 --> 00:10:52.251

WE HAVE ANSWERED THE QUESTION OF

00:10:56.655 --> 00:10:58.057
WHETHER THE CREATIVE ECONOMY AS

00:10:58.124 --> 00:11:00.893
ECONOMICALLY SIGNIFICANT IT IS.

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:02.495
NOW WE MUST ASK HOW WE'RE

00:11:02.561 --> 00:11:03.763

00:11:03.829 --> 00:11:05.231

NOT ONLY TO UNDERSTAND HOW WE

00:11:07.733 --> 00:11:09.235
CAN SUPPORT MORE ARTS EDUCATION

00:11:09.301 --> 00:11:10.903
IN SCHOOLS.

00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:12.438
BUT TO LOOK EVEN DEEPER INTO HOW

00:11:12.505 --> 00:11:13.839
WE'RE TEACHING DIVERSE PROBLEM

00:11:13.906 --> 00:11:15.841

00:11:15.908 --> 00:11:16.976
HOW WE'RE HELPING PARENTS

00:11:17.043 --> 00:11:18.477
UNDERSTAND THE MANY PROFESSIONAL

00:11:18.544 --> 00:11:20.413
OPPORTUNITIES THEY MAY NEVER

00:11:20.479 --> 00:11:22.114
HAVE IMAGINED FOR THEIR CHILDREN.

00:11:22.181 --> 00:11:23.382
IF PARENTS DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT

00:11:23.449 --> 00:11:24.950
THEIR ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES AND

00:11:25.017 --> 00:11:26.485
CREATIVE FIELDS HOW CAN THEY

00:11:26.552 --> 00:11:27.686
SUPPORT THEIR CHILDREN IN

00:11:27.753 --> 00:11:29.021
SEEKING THEM.

00:11:29.088 --> 00:11:30.589
AND IMAGINE ALL THE CREATIVE

CREATIVE ECONOMY THIS IS SUCH AN

00:19:09.147 --> 00:19:13.252
IMPORTANT PROJECT IN MY OPINION --

00:19:13.318 --> 00:19:15.420
SO SEVERAL YEARS AGO WHEN I WAS

00:19:15.487 --> 00:19:16.722
THE CHIEF ECONOMIST AT THE LOS

00:19:16.788 --> 00:19:18.056
ANGELES COUNTY ECONOMIC

00:19:18.123 --> 00:19:19.291
DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION OR THE

00:19:19.358 --> 00:19:22.127
LED SEE THAT WAS WHEN THE IDEA.

00:19:22.194 --> 00:19:24.396
CAME UP OUT OF DOING A STUDY OF

00:19:24.463 --> 00:19:24.963
THE CREATIVE ECONOMY AT THE

00:19:25.030 --> 00:19:27.966
STATE LEVEL -- AND AND THERE'S

00:19:28.033 --> 00:19:31.203
STILL SO MUCH TO DO IN THIS VEIN

00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:34.406
BUT WILL CONTINUE TO PLUG AWAY --

00:19:34.473 --> 00:19:36.742
AND ALSO -- YEARS AGO AND AND

00:19:36.808 --> 00:19:38.777
HAS JOBS I HAD OCCASION TO GO UP

00:19:38.844 --> 00:19:39.912
AND DOWN THE STATE THROUGH

00:19:39.978 --> 00:19:42.114
TRAVELS AND AND TO SEE AND

00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:44.616
CITIES AND COMMUNITIES LARGE AND

00:19:44.683 --> 00:19:45.817
SMALL HOW THE ARTS.

00:19:45.884 --> 00:19:47.319
BUT IT'S A COMMUNITY THEATER OR

00:19:47.386 --> 00:19:49.054
SOME OTHER MANIFESTATION REALLY

00:19:49.121 --> 00:19:50.756
IS A PART OF EACH AND EVERY

00:19:50.822 --> 00:19:51.890
COMMUNITY HERE.

00:19:51.957 --> 00:19:53.492
THROUGHOUT THE STATE LARGE AND

00:19:53.559 --> 00:19:54.693
SMALL SO -- LET ME SEE IF I CAN

00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:57.763
GET THE TECHNOLOGY TO WORK IF

00:19:57.829 --> 00:19:58.330
THAT WAS THE WRONG BUTTON TO

00:19:58.397 --> 00:19:59.031
PRESS [inaudible]

00:19:59.097 --> 00:20:00.132

THANK YOU OKAY SO -- I'M LOOKING

00:20:03.001 --> 00:20:04.436
FOR TO PRESENT THE FINDINGS OF

00:20:04.503 --> 00:20:09.908
THIS MOST RECENT -- OTIS --

00:20:09.975 --> 00:20:11.410
REPORT ON THE CREATIVE ECONOMY

00:20:11.476 --> 00:20:12.210
SO WHEN WE THINK ABOUT -- THE

00:20:12.277 --> 00:20:14.146
THE ARTS -- WE THINK OF FINE

00:20:14.212 --> 00:20:16.882
ARTS PERFORMING ARTS AND SO ON

00:20:16.949 --> 00:20:19.051
AND THE EDUCATION ASPECT BUT IN

00:20:19.117 --> 00:20:19.985
THIS.

00:20:20.052 --> 00:20:21.420
CONTEXT OF THE CREATIVE ECONOMY

00:20:21.486 --> 00:20:23.055
WE'RE GONNA STRETCHER THINKING

00:20:23.121 --> 00:20:24.957
GO BEYOND THE ARCH TO COMMERCIAL

00:20:25.023 --> 00:20:27.192
APPLICATIONS OF DESIGN AND

00:20:27.259 --> 00:20:28.360
CREATIVITY.

00:20:28.427 --> 00:20:29.628
WE'RE NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT THE

00:20:29.695 --> 00:20:30.929
ARTS AS WE COMMONLY.

00:20:30.996 --> 00:20:32.664
THINK OF THEM WERE THINKING ALSO

00:20:32.731 --> 00:20:35.067
ABOUT INDUSTRIES WHERE.

00:20:35.133 --> 00:20:37.936
DESIGNING CREATIVITY IS -- IS AT

00:20:38.003 --> 00:20:39.271
AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OR AN

00:20:39.338 --> 00:20:41.673
ESSENTIAL INGREDIENT. TO WHAT

00:20:41.740 --> 00:20:43.275
THEY DO SO WE'RE GOING TO BE

00:20:43.342 --> 00:20:44.610
LOOKING AS WELL NOT JUST AT THE

00:20:44.676 --> 00:20:46.078
DESIGN BUT ALSO.

00:20:46.144 --> 00:20:48.513
THE MANUFACTURE OF PRODUCTS OR

00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:50.082
THE PRODUCTION OF SERVICES AS

00:20:50.148 --> 00:20:51.483
WELL AS THE DISTRIBUTION SOME

00:20:51.550 --> 00:20:53.719
CASES -- BECAUSE THE LINES BLUR

00:20:53.785 --> 00:20:54.820
WHEN WE TAKE A LOOK AT

00:20:54.886 --> 00:20:56.855
INDIVIDUAL INDUSTRIES -- IT WHEN

00:20:56.922 --> 00:20:59.024
WITH RESPECT TO EACH OF THESE

00:20:59.091 --> 00:21:00.626
DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF OF THESE

00:21:00.692 --> 00:21:01.960
INDUSTRIES WILL LOOK AT THE

00:21:02.027 --> 00:21:03.495
STATE AND TO A LESSER EXTENT TO

00:21:03.562 --> 00:21:05.697
THE REGIONAL -- WE ALSO ROLLED

00:21:05.764 --> 00:21:08.000
IN TO THIS REPORT -- MORE ABOUT

00:21:08.066 --> 00:21:10.202
CREATIVE OCCUPATIONS -- SLICING

00:21:10.268 --> 00:21:13.372
AND DICING -- THE BREAK DOWN BY --

00:21:13.438 --> 00:21:15.874
WOMEN'S PARTICIPATION -- ETHNIC

00:21:15.941 --> 00:21:16.975
PARTICIPATION SO.

00:21:17.042 --> 00:21:18.210
ONE SO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT

00:21:18.276 --> 00:21:19.544
THAT EVEN TWENTY MINUTES IS NOT

00:21:19.611 --> 00:21:24.182
ENOUGH TO TO REALLY SUMMARIZE A

00:21:24.249 --> 00:21:24.783
TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY SOME ODD

00:21:24.850 --> 00:21:26.618
PAGE REPORT -- AND THEN LAST BUT

00:21:26.685 --> 00:21:27.853
NOT LEAST THERE'S THIS BROADER

00:21:27.919 --> 00:21:30.188
ECO SYSTEM -- INVOLVING ARTS

00:21:30.255 --> 00:21:32.124
EDUCATION THE ORGANIZATIONS THAT

00:21:32.190 --> 00:21:35.827
SUPPORTED THE GOVERNMENT ITSELF --

00:21:35.894 --> 00:21:38.430
THEY WILL TALK ABOUT AS WELL SO.

00:21:38.497 --> 00:21:39.765
WE JUST WANT TO SAY WE'RE REALLY

00:21:39.831 --> 00:21:41.400
PROJECT OF THE REPORT CAME TO US

00:21:41.466 --> 00:21:44.369
UNREDACTED.

00:21:44.436 --> 00:21:48.273
ALL ABOUT -- TRANSPARENCY.

00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:49.241
SO IF YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH THE

00:21:49.307 --> 00:21:50.809
THIS REPORT FROM YEARS PAST

00:21:50.876 --> 00:21:52.077
THERE WERE SOMEWHERE ELEVEN OR

00:21:52.144 --> 00:21:53.578
TWELVE IN THIS LARGE INDUSTRY

00:21:53.645 --> 00:21:54.980
GROUPS WE CONSOLIDATED.

00:21:55.047 --> 00:21:56.481
THOSE GROUPS INTO FIVE THIS TIME

00:21:56.548 --> 00:21:57.849
AROUND I THINK THEIR SELF

00:21:57.916 --> 00:21:58.884
EXPLANATORY WHAT YOU SEE UP HERE

00:21:58.950 --> 00:21:59.751
ON THE SCREEN WE'VE GOT

00:21:59.818 --> 00:22:01.086
ARCHITECTURE AND RELATED

00:22:01.153 --> 00:22:03.889
SERVICES -- ENTERTAINMENT AND

00:22:03.955 --> 00:22:05.357
DIGITAL MEDIA FASHION.

00:22:05.424 --> 00:22:07.025
FINE AND PERFORMING ARTS AND

00:22:07.092 --> 00:22:07.659
THEN WE HAVE THIS THING CALLED

00:22:07.726 --> 00:22:09.361
CREATIVE GOODS AND PRODUCTS

00:22:09.428 --> 00:22:11.196
WHICH MIGHT BE THE MOST -- HARD

00:22:11.263 --> 00:22:12.531
TO DIGEST BUT THIS IS REALLY --

00:22:12.597 --> 00:22:14.399
FURNISHINGS LIGHTING A WHOLE

00:22:14.466 --> 00:22:16.101
ARRAY OF THINGS THAT YOU KNOW

00:22:16.168 --> 00:22:17.636
GOING TO OUR HOMES FOR EXAMPLE.

00:22:17.703 --> 00:22:19.604
AS WELL AS TOYS WHICH YOU KNOW

00:22:19.671 --> 00:22:21.073
THAT'S ABIG PART OF THE

00:22:21.139 --> 00:22:23.542
CREATIVE ECONOMY AS WELL -- SO

00:22:23.608 --> 00:22:25.510
THERE ARE OVER SIXTY INDUSTRIES

00:22:25.577 --> 00:22:26.511
THAT MAKE UP THE CREATIVE

00:22:26.578 --> 00:22:28.180
ECONOMY AND THEY BREAK DOWN I

00:22:28.246 --> 00:22:29.548
KNOW THIS IS HARD TO READ BUT

00:22:29.614 --> 00:22:31.450
THEY BREAK DOWN ROUGHLY -- HALF

00:22:31.516 --> 00:22:32.818
BEING IN ENTERTAINMENT AND

00:22:32.884 --> 00:22:34.986
DIGITAL MEDIA -- THEN WE HAVE A

00:22:35.053 --> 00:22:36.655
NUMBER IN THAT CREATIVE GOODS

00:22:36.722 --> 00:22:38.557
AND PRODUCTS CATEGORY FASHION IS

00:22:38.623 --> 00:22:40.659
PROMINENT -- DOWN BELOW IN THE

00:22:40.726 --> 00:22:41.426
BOTTOM RIGHT YOU HAVE

00:22:41.493 --> 00:22:42.961
ARCHITECTURE RELATED SERVICES

00:22:43.028 --> 00:22:45.030
AND THEN FINE AND PERFORMING

00:22:45.097 --> 00:22:48.500
ARTS -- SO.

00:22:48.567 --> 00:22:50.569
BIG PICTURE -- WE HAVE ABOUT

00:22:50.635 --> 00:22:51.269
EIGHTY THOUSAND ESTABLISHMENTS

00:22:51.336 --> 00:22:53.672
BASED ON DATA FROM THE BUREAU OF

00:22:53.739 --> 00:22:55.207
LABOR STATISTICS THAT ARE

00:22:55.273 --> 00:22:57.743
CLASSIFIED AS CREATIVE NOW THIS

00:22:57.809 --> 00:22:59.344
IS A GOOD TIME FOR ME TO STOP

00:22:59.411 --> 00:23:00.512
AND SAY WELL.

00:23:00.579 --> 00:23:02.481
HOW DID WE ARRIVE AT THIS LIST

00:23:02.547 --> 00:23:04.316
OF INDUSTRIES THAT?

00:23:04.382 --> 00:23:06.518
WE CONSIDER TO BE CREATIVE --

00:23:06.585 --> 00:23:08.320
THERE'S REALLY NO STANDARD --

00:23:08.386 --> 00:23:10.288
ANYWHERE IN ACADEMIC OR OTHER

00:23:10.355 --> 00:23:13.592
LITERATURE THAT ESTABLISHES. ONE

00:23:13.658 --> 00:23:16.561
SET OF INDUSTRIES TO BE --

00:23:16.628 --> 00:23:18.363
CONSTITUTED AS CREATIVE OR NOT

00:23:18.430 --> 00:23:18.964
BUT WE'VE BEEN DOING THIS A

00:23:19.030 --> 00:23:20.532
WHILE WE WE DID LITERATURE

00:23:20.599 --> 00:23:22.033
REVIEW SEVERAL YEARS AGO AND WE

00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:23.869
DID IT AGAIN THIS YEAR TO

00:23:23.935 --> 00:23:25.670
DETERMINE WHICH INDUSTRIES --

00:23:25.737 --> 00:23:27.639
ARE TYPICALLY CONSIDERED BEING A

00:23:27.706 --> 00:23:29.508
PART OF THE CREATIVE ECONOMY AND

00:23:29.574 --> 00:23:31.076
WE USE THAT AS THE BASIS FOR

00:23:31.143 --> 00:23:32.711
IDENTIFYING INDUSTRIES IN

00:23:32.778 --> 00:23:34.713
OFFICIAL GOVERNMENT DATA -- BY

00:23:34.780 --> 00:23:36.882
INDUSTRY CODE AGGREGATING THEM

00:23:36.948 --> 00:23:39.251
INTO THESE -- THESE CATEGORIES

00:23:39.317 --> 00:23:40.852
AND THEN WE CAME UP WITH THESE

00:23:40.919 --> 00:23:43.288
ESTABLISHMENT EMPLOYEE AND AND

00:23:43.355 --> 00:23:44.623
THAT SHOULD BE AVERAGE.

00:23:44.689 --> 00:23:46.491
AVERAGE ANNUAL WAGE -- NUMBERS

00:23:46.558 --> 00:23:47.726
THAT YOU SEE HERE FOR THE STATE

00:23:47.793 --> 00:23:49.261
AS A WHOLE EIGHTY THOUSAND

00:23:49.327 --> 00:23:51.997
ESTABLISHMENTS MOSTLY IN

00:23:52.063 --> 00:23:53.965
ENTERTAINMENT AND DIGITAL MEDIA.

00:23:54.032 --> 00:23:55.300
OVER A MILLION -- WAGE AND

00:23:55.367 --> 00:23:57.669
SALARY WORKERS SO -- AN ASTERISK

00:23:57.736 --> 00:23:59.571
ON THAT POINT IS THAT WE DO NOT

00:23:59.638 --> 00:24:01.706
HAVE THE THE INDEPENDENT

00:24:01.773 --> 00:24:04.576
CONTRACTORS -- TO FREELANCERS

00:24:04.643 --> 00:24:05.744
AND SO ON INCLUDED IN THAT

00:24:05.811 --> 00:24:06.812
NUMBER BUT IT'S ALSO

00:24:06.878 --> 00:24:08.580
SIGNIFICANTLY LARGER IT'S JUST

00:24:08.647 --> 00:24:09.147
COMES FROM A DIFFERENT DATA

00:24:09.214 --> 00:24:10.081
SOURCE.

00:24:10.148 --> 00:24:12.083
AND THE THE PAYROLL NUMBERS I

00:24:12.150 --> 00:24:13.652
APOLOGIZE IT SHOULD BE AVERAGE

00:24:13.718 --> 00:24:15.620
WAGE AND HAD JUST FOR REFERENCE

00:24:15.687 --> 00:24:17.222
IT'S A HUNDRED TWO THOUSAND

00:24:17.289 --> 00:24:19.024
DOLLARS IS THE AVERAGE WAGE --

00:24:19.090 --> 00:24:20.158
FOR THE CREATIVE INDUSTRIES

00:24:20.225 --> 00:24:21.359
WHICH IS CONSIDERABLY HIGHER

00:24:21.426 --> 00:24:23.929
THAN THE SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND

00:24:23.995 --> 00:24:24.996
DOLLAR AVERAGE WAGE.

00:24:25.063 --> 00:24:29.134
FOR ALL WORKERS IN CALIFORNIA IN

00:24:29.201 --> 00:24:32.003
THE PERIOD.

00:24:32.070 --> 00:24:32.571
TWO THOUSAND IT'S ONE OH TWO

00:24:32.637 --> 00:24:32.904
RATHER THAN.

00:24:32.971 --> 00:24:34.472
ONE THIRTY FOUR OKAY -- SO.

00:24:34.539 --> 00:24:37.075
IN TERMS OF THE INDUSTRIES AND

00:24:37.142 --> 00:24:38.844
THEIR CHANGES OVER TIME YOU CAN

00:24:38.910 --> 00:24:41.746
SEE THAT -- FEW INDUSTRIES HAVE

00:24:41.813 --> 00:24:43.081
SEEN GROWTH IN TERMS OF THE

00:24:43.148 --> 00:24:43.815
NUMBER OF ESTABLISHMENTS OVER

00:24:43.882 --> 00:24:46.384
TIME SOME HAVE SEEN DECLINE AT

00:24:46.451 --> 00:24:47.485
THE VERY TOP YOU GET

00:24:47.552 --> 00:24:49.788
ENTERTAINMENT AND DIGITAL MEDIA.

00:24:49.855 --> 00:24:54.693
THINK ABOUT THIS.NEXUS BETWEEN TECHNOLOGY AND AND

00:24:54.759 --> 00:24:56.661
ENTERTAINMENT AND DIGITAL ALL

00:24:56.728 --> 00:24:58.230
THINGS DIGITAL THESE DAYS A

00:24:58.296 --> 00:25:00.332
LARGE SHARE OF THE GROWTH IN THE

00:25:00.398 --> 00:25:01.499
STATEWIDE ECONOMY OVER THE PAST

00:25:01.566 --> 00:25:02.901
SEVERAL YEARS HAS COME FROM THE

00:25:02.968 --> 00:25:03.969
TECH SECTOR.

00:25:04.035 --> 00:25:05.704
AND IT SPILLED OVER INTO THIS

00:25:05.770 --> 00:25:07.005
ENTERTAINMENT SECTOR THAT WE

00:25:07.072 --> 00:25:09.174
HAVE HERE SO 22% GROWTH IN

00:25:09.241 --> 00:25:11.243
ESTABLISHMENT SO -- IN THAT

00:25:11.309 --> 00:25:13.311
SECTOR AND THEN OTHERS GROWTH

00:25:13.378 --> 00:25:14.346
THAT WE'RE SEEING HERE FOR

00:25:14.412 --> 00:25:16.648
EXAMPLE WITH CREATIVE GOODS AND

00:25:16.715 --> 00:25:18.016
AND ARTS AND ARCHITECTURE.

00:25:18.083 --> 00:25:19.417
HAVE TO DO WITH THE ECONOMIC

00:25:19.484 --> 00:25:21.253
CYCLE AND HAVE TO DO WITH GROWTH

00:25:21.319 --> 00:25:22.320
IN CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY.

00:25:22.387 --> 00:25:23.521
SO.

00:25:23.588 --> 00:25:25.156
YOU CAN TAKE A LOOK AT EACH ONE

00:25:25.223 --> 00:25:26.124
OF THESE INDUSTRIES WHERE

00:25:26.191 --> 00:25:27.259
INDUSTRY GROUPS AND YOU CAN KIND

00:25:27.325 --> 00:25:29.127
OF FIGURE OUT WELL HOW MUCH OF

00:25:29.194 --> 00:25:31.296
THIS IS DUE -- TO UNDER --

00:25:31.363 --> 00:25:32.764
UNDERLYING TRENDS IN THE ECONOMY

00:25:32.831 --> 00:25:34.032
HOW MUCH OF THIS IS THESE

00:25:34.099 --> 00:25:35.367
CHANGES ARE DUE TO WHAT'S

00:25:35.433 --> 00:25:36.902
HAPPENING UNIQUELY TO THAT

00:25:36.968 --> 00:25:39.638
INDUSTRY -- FASHION IS HEAVILY

00:25:39.704 --> 00:25:41.239
WEIGHTED TOWARD MANUFACTURING

00:25:41.306 --> 00:25:43.174
AND MANUFACTURING HAS LOST BOTH

00:25:43.241 --> 00:25:44.809
ESTABLISHMENT IN EMPLOYMENT.

00:25:44.876 --> 00:25:46.177
OVER THE LAST -- SEVERAL DECADES

00:25:46.244 --> 00:25:48.780
REALLY SO -- TO BE FLAT OVER

00:25:48.847 --> 00:25:50.348
THIS TIME PERIOD IS IS NOT ALL

00:25:50.415 --> 00:25:51.349
THAT BAD.

00:25:51.416 --> 00:25:52.517
AND CREATIVE IN GOOD CREATIVE

00:25:52.584 --> 00:25:54.286
GOODS AND PRODUCTS ALSO A

00:25:54.352 --> 00:25:55.854
MANUFACTURING HEAVY SECTOR OF

00:25:55.921 --> 00:25:57.389
THE ECONOMY SO WE'RE SAYING JOBS

00:25:57.455 --> 00:25:59.391
BEING DISPLACED BY TECHNOLOGY.

00:25:59.457 --> 00:26:01.159
MAYBE MOVING OVERSEAS BUT MORE

00:26:01.226 --> 00:26:03.128
SO DISPLACEMENT BY TECHNOLOGY SO

00:26:03.194 --> 00:26:04.629
INTO THE ESTABLISHMENT COUNTS

00:26:04.696 --> 00:26:08.533
LOWER COMPARED -- 220-002-00010.

00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:10.335
JOB CANCER GENERALLY HIGHER WITH

00:26:10.402 --> 00:26:14.539
THE EXCEPTION OF FASHION --

00:26:14.606 --> 00:26:17.742
CONSIDERING WHAT -- WE HAVE SEEN --

00:26:17.809 --> 00:26:19.344
IT OVER THE LAST SEVERAL DECADES

00:26:19.411 --> 00:26:21.713
BUT THESE OTHER SECTORS ECONOMY

00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:24.382
OVER THIS TIME PERIOD WHICH

00:26:24.449 --> 00:26:26.217
ARGUABLY IS RIGHT.

00:26:26.284 --> 00:26:28.386
AT THE BEGINNING OF THE ECONOMIC

00:26:28.453 --> 00:26:31.790
RECOVERY -- WE HAVE SEEN GROWTH --

00:26:31.856 --> 00:26:36.227
TO VARYING DEGREES AND IT'S IT'S

00:26:36.294 --> 00:26:37.495
GUEST JUDGE JOBS ARE OF

00:26:37.562 --> 00:26:39.564
MANUFACTURING JOBS ARE IN

00:26:39.631 --> 00:26:42.167
GENERAL ARE IN DECLINE -- SO

00:26:42.233 --> 00:26:43.635
IT'S NOT JUST MANUFACTURING BUT

00:26:43.702 --> 00:26:47.072
EVEN AEROSPACE FOR EXAMPLE AND

00:26:47.138 --> 00:26:48.006
SOME OF THOSE JOBS ARE BEING

00:26:48.073 --> 00:26:49.240
DISPLACED BY TECHNOLOGY SOME OF

00:26:49.307 --> 00:26:50.742
MY JUST MOVING OUT OF STATE

00:26:50.809 --> 00:26:51.977
BECAUSE OF HIGHER WAGES.

00:26:52.043 --> 00:26:54.279
OR MAYBE MOVING OUT OF COUNTRY.

00:26:54.346 --> 00:26:55.547
SO THAT'S SEE THAT'S WHAT'S

00:26:55.613 --> 00:26:57.048
HAPPENING WITH FASHION WE STILL

00:26:57.115 --> 00:26:58.883
HAVE THE DESIGN ASPECT IS

00:26:58.950 --> 00:26:59.751
PRESENT IN.

00:26:59.818 --> 00:27:02.354
ALL OF CALIFORNIA AND SOUTHERN

00:27:02.420 --> 00:27:04.823
CALIFORNIA PARTICULAR.

00:27:04.889 --> 00:27:05.890
OVERALL CREATED ECONOMY JOB

00:27:05.957 --> 00:27:07.325
GROWTH IS ACTUALLY EXCEEDED THE

00:27:07.392 --> 00:27:09.728
NON CREATIVE SIDE OF THE ECONOMY

00:27:09.794 --> 00:27:11.596
24% OVER THIS TIME SPAN.

00:27:11.663 --> 00:27:13.398
VERSUS ABOUT 21% EVEN

00:27:13.465 --> 00:27:14.966
ESTABLISHMENT GROWTH AND OVERALL

00:27:15.033 --> 00:27:16.801
HE'S BEEN SLIGHTLY FASTER THAN

00:27:16.868 --> 00:27:19.504
THE THE NON CREATIVE SIDE OF THE

00:27:19.571 --> 00:27:20.205
ECONOMY.

00:27:20.271 --> 00:27:21.306
I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE THAT'S THE

00:27:21.373 --> 00:27:23.908
RIGHT TERM TO USE FOR THE REST

00:27:23.975 --> 00:27:25.977
OF THE WORLD BUT CREE WITH.

00:27:26.044 --> 00:27:26.978
FOR YOU KNOW BIFURCATING AN TO

00:27:27.045 --> 00:27:28.546
CREATE A NON CREATED FOR THE

00:27:28.613 --> 00:27:29.848
PURPOSE OF THIS PRESENTATION.

00:27:29.914 --> 00:27:31.716
WAGE GROWTH HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANT

00:27:31.783 --> 00:27:33.284
IN THE CREATIVE SECTOR OF THE

00:27:33.351 --> 00:27:34.986
ECONOMY AGAIN YOU SAW EARLIER

00:27:35.053 --> 00:27:36.755
THAT ONE HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR

00:27:36.821 --> 00:27:37.389
THOUSAND WAGE NUMBER IT SHOULD

00:27:37.455 --> 00:27:38.723
OF AND ONE HUNDRED AND TWO

00:27:38.790 --> 00:27:39.457
THOUSAND DOLLARS.

00:27:39.524 --> 00:27:43.294
I APOLOGIZE FOR THE FOR THEIR

00:27:43.361 --> 00:27:45.630
AND SO YOU'VE ALREADY SEEN

00:27:45.697 --> 00:27:47.332
ENTERTAINMENT AND DIGITAL MEDIA.

00:27:47.399 --> 00:27:49.534
IS PLAYING A BIG ROLE IN THIS

00:27:49.601 --> 00:27:50.802
GROWTH AND IT'S WHAT AND IT'S

00:27:50.869 --> 00:27:52.404
NOT JUST WHAT OUR KIDS ARE DOING

00:27:52.470 --> 00:27:53.004
TODAY.

00:27:53.071 --> 00:27:54.072
ALTHOUGH YOU CAN SEE UP ON THE

00:27:54.139 --> 00:27:56.041
SCREEN WHAT THEY'RE DOING -- BUT

00:27:56.107 --> 00:27:57.675
WHAT SO MANY PEOPLE AND SO MANY

00:27:57.742 --> 00:27:58.676
GENERATIONS -- OF OF

00:27:58.743 --> 00:28:00.779
CALIFORNIANS AND AROUND THE

00:28:00.845 --> 00:28:02.580
WORLD ARE DOING TODAY WE'VE GOT.

00:28:02.647 --> 00:28:04.182
WHAT WE'RE CALLING DIGITAL

00:28:04.249 --> 00:28:05.750
DESTRUCTION IS ENTERTAINMENT --

00:28:05.817 --> 00:28:07.452
VIRTUAL REALITY IS MAKING ITS

00:28:07.519 --> 00:28:08.820
WAY INTO A NUMBER OF INDUSTRIES

00:28:08.887 --> 00:28:11.089
AT THIS TIME -- ANY NUMBER OF

00:28:11.156 --> 00:28:13.825
OTHER KINDS OF ASPECTS OF WHAT

00:28:13.892 --> 00:28:16.461
MAYBE ORIGINATED AS SOME ASPECT

00:28:16.528 --> 00:28:18.296
OF OF ENTERTAINMENT HAVE MADE

00:28:18.363 --> 00:28:20.098
THEIR WAY INTO OTHER INDUSTRIES

00:28:20.165 --> 00:28:21.332
AND ARE AFFECTING OTHER

00:28:21.399 --> 00:28:22.700
INDUSTRIES IN THIS IS JUST THE

00:28:22.767 --> 00:28:23.735
THE BEGINNING.

00:28:23.802 --> 00:28:26.571
I WOULD SAY OF A TRANSFER MAYES

00:28:26.638 --> 00:28:27.338
TRANSFORMATION THAT'S BEEN

00:28:27.405 --> 00:28:29.374
OCCURRING SO WHEN WE LOOK ACROSS

00:28:29.441 --> 00:28:31.543
THE STATE GEOGRAPHICALLY -- A

00:28:31.609 --> 00:28:34.612
LITTLE OVER HALF OF THE JOBS.

00:28:34.679 --> 00:28:36.114
IN THE CREATIVE ECONOMY ARE IN

00:28:36.181 --> 00:28:37.415
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WHICH IS A

00:28:37.482 --> 00:28:40.151
LA IN ORANGE COUNTY -- AND THEN

00:28:40.218 --> 00:28:41.853
ANOTHER SIGNIFICANT PERCENTAGE

00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:44.089
ABOUT A THIRD OR IN THE BAY AREA.

00:28:44.155 --> 00:28:46.057
THEN YOU HAVE JOBS ELSEWHERE

00:28:46.124 --> 00:28:48.726
THROUGHOUT THE OTHER REGIONS OF

00:28:48.793 --> 00:28:51.062
THE STATE AS WELL -- UPSTATE

00:28:51.129 --> 00:28:53.064
CALIFORNIA'S WHERE WE WILL START

00:28:53.131 --> 00:28:54.732
BECAUSE IT PROBABLY -- RARELY

00:28:54.799 --> 00:28:56.000
GETS.

00:28:56.067 --> 00:28:58.703
FIRST BILLING HAS ABOUT SIXTEEN

00:28:58.770 --> 00:29:01.072
HUNDRED JOBS IN WHAT WE HAVE TO

00:29:01.139 --> 00:29:02.540
FIND TO BE THE CREATIVE ECONOMY.

00:29:02.607 --> 00:29:04.476
YOU'LL SEE AND WHEN WE LOOK AT

00:29:04.542 --> 00:29:06.511
EACH OF THESE THAT -- THERE'S

00:29:06.578 --> 00:29:07.579
SOME PRETTY COMMON TREND

00:29:07.645 --> 00:29:08.913
ENTERTAINMENT AND DIGITAL MEDIA

00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:11.116
TENDS TO BE MAKE UP A LARGER

00:29:11.182 --> 00:29:13.351
SHARE FOLLOWED BY -- CREATIVE

00:29:13.418 --> 00:29:15.520
GOODS AND PRODUCTS.

00:29:15.587 --> 00:29:16.821
ENTERTAINMENT DIGITAL MEDIA.

00:29:16.888 --> 00:29:18.156
ACROSS THE REGIONS OF THE STATE

00:29:18.223 --> 00:29:20.291
GENERALLY HAVE BEEN ADDING JOBS

00:29:20.358 --> 00:29:21.926
ALTHOUGH YOU'LL SEE BY LOOKING

00:29:21.993 --> 00:29:23.495
AT THE RIGHT HAND SIDE.

00:29:23.561 --> 00:29:25.196
THAT THIS -- PART OF THE STATE

00:29:25.263 --> 00:29:26.731
ACTUALLY LOST JOBS AND I THINK

00:29:26.798 --> 00:29:28.133
THAT'S PROBABLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO

00:29:28.199 --> 00:29:29.767
THE LOSS OF TRADITIONAL MEDIA

00:29:29.834 --> 00:29:30.735
BECAUSE WE HAVE.

00:29:30.802 --> 00:29:33.138
AMONG OTHER THINGS OF NEWSPAPERS.

00:29:33.204 --> 00:29:34.105
AND THAT TYPE OF TRADITIONAL

00:29:34.172 --> 00:29:35.874
MEDIA IS A PART OF THE

00:29:35.940 --> 00:29:38.243
ENTERTAINMENT AND DIGITAL MEDIA --

00:29:38.309 --> 00:29:40.979
CATEGORY.

00:29:41.045 --> 00:29:41.946
CULINARY ARTS PART OF THE

00:29:42.013 --> 00:29:42.514
CREATIVE ECONOMY IS A GREAT

00:29:42.580 --> 00:29:44.082
QUESTION WE'VE BEEN BANDING THAT

00:29:44.149 --> 00:29:47.185
AROUND AND THOSE OF US WHO ENJOY

00:29:47.252 --> 00:29:49.120
FOOD THINK IT'S WORTH.

00:29:49.187 --> 00:29:51.856
THINKING ABOUT IT AND SO WE'LL

00:29:51.923 --> 00:29:53.825
HAVE TO SEE WHETHER THERE ARE

00:29:53.892 --> 00:29:57.896
SOME OTHER INDUSTRIES AS AND

00:29:57.962 --> 00:29:58.730
YEAH -- SO THAT CERTAINLY IS IS

00:29:58.796 --> 00:30:02.567
A CANDIDATE FOR FUTURE RESEARCH --

00:30:02.634 --> 00:30:05.336
AND IN MY OWN COMMUNITY THERE A

00:30:05.403 --> 00:30:07.205
HIGH SCHOOL A MAGNET HIGH SCHOOL

00:30:07.272 --> 00:30:08.006
THAT WAS JUST ESTABLISHED FOR

00:30:08.072 --> 00:30:09.741
THE PURPOSE OF CULINARY ARTS AND

00:30:09.807 --> 00:30:10.441
HOSPITALITY [inaudible]

00:30:10.508 --> 00:30:13.144
SO -- YOU'LL NOTICE THE FINE

00:30:13.211 --> 00:30:14.746
ARTS AND PERFORMING ARTS IS UP

00:30:14.812 --> 00:30:17.081
WHICH IS A GOOD SIGN THIS ABOUT

00:30:17.148 --> 00:30:17.982
SIXTEEN HUNDRED JOBS IN THIS

00:30:18.049 --> 00:30:22.554
AREA OF MOVING ALONG -- WE MOVED.

00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:24.556

MEDIA ALSO THE AREA WHERE WE'VE

00:30:30.028 --> 00:30:31.529
SEEN.

00:30:31.596 --> 00:30:34.532
THE GREATEST GROWTH OCCUR -- AND

00:30:34.599 --> 00:30:36.768
AND I COULD SPEND TIME ON EACH

00:30:36.834 --> 00:30:39.003

ABOUT EACH AND EVERY DETAIL OF

00:30:44.642 --> 00:30:47.512
THE BAY AREA WELL OVER A COUPLE

CONSIDER TO BE TACK.

00:30:57.488 --> 00:31:00.124

ELSEWHERE -- BUT YOU'RE SEEING

00:31:39.664 --> 00:31:41.366
THEIR THAT ARCHITECTURE IS THE

00:31:41.432 --> 00:31:43.201
ONE THAT IS LEADING THE WAY IN

00:31:43.268 --> 00:31:46.271
TERMS OF JOB GAINS -- AND THEN

00:31:46.337 --> 00:31:47.805
WE MOVED TO THE CENTRAL VALLEY.

00:31:47.872 --> 00:31:49.474
OF LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT STORY

00:31:49.540 --> 00:31:51.342
THERE IS WE'RE SEEING SOME

00:31:51.409 --> 00:31:53.678
CONTRACTION IN ENTERTAINMENT.

00:31:53.745 --> 00:31:55.113
AND I DON'T MEAN TO BELABOR THE

00:31:55.179 --> 00:31:56.648
POINT BUT I THINK IT'S DUE TO

00:31:56.714 --> 00:31:58.349
THE DECLINE OF TRADITIONAL MEDIA

00:31:58.416 --> 00:32:00.485
IN THESE INSTANCES WHERE IT IS --

00:32:00.551 --> 00:32:02.253
SEEING A TO DECREASE THE INLAND

00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:04.055
EMPIRE IS AN AREA THAT IS RICH

00:32:04.122 --> 00:32:05.890
IN MANUFACTURING SO IT SHOULD BE

00:32:05.957 --> 00:32:07.258
NO SURPRISE TO SEE.

00:32:07.325 --> 00:32:09.193
THAT FASHION AND CREATIVE GOODS

00:32:09.260 --> 00:32:11.162
AND PRODUCTS ARE BOTH -- ON THE

00:32:11.229 --> 00:32:12.930
RISE IN THAT PARTICULAR AREA OF

00:32:12.997 --> 00:32:15.700
THE STATE -- AND THEN AS WE MOVE

00:32:15.767 --> 00:32:17.535
A LITTLE FURTHER ALONG -- TO THE

00:32:17.602 --> 00:32:19.037
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA LA ORANGE

00:32:19.103 --> 00:32:21.739
COUNTY REGION HOME TO ABOUT FOUR

00:32:21.806 --> 00:32:22.307
HUNDRED THOUSAND OF THE ONE

00:32:22.373 --> 00:32:23.641
MILLION JOBS IN THE CREATIVE

00:32:23.708 --> 00:32:25.543
ECONOMY THROUGHOUT THE STATE --

00:32:25.610 --> 00:32:26.744
YOU CAN SEE THAT.

00:32:26.811 --> 00:32:27.979
THE LION'S SHARE OF THE GAINS

00:32:28.046 --> 00:32:29.881
HAVE OCCURRED IN.

00:32:29.947 --> 00:32:30.648
THIS ENTERTAINMENT AND DIGITAL

00:32:30.715 --> 00:32:32.817
MEDIA AREA SO YOU KNOW THIS THAT

00:32:32.884 --> 00:32:34.185
PARTICULAR CATEGORY HAS REALLY

00:32:34.252 --> 00:32:35.753
CHANGED OVER THE LAST SEVERAL

00:32:35.820 --> 00:32:37.455
YEARS -- GONE ARE THE DAYS OF

00:32:37.522 --> 00:32:39.157
FILM PRODUCTION GONNA THE DAYS

00:32:39.223 --> 00:32:41.459
OF YOU KNOW LARGE SCALE GONE BUT

00:32:41.526 --> 00:32:42.493
THEY HAVE TO THEIR NOW MAKING

00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:44.228
ROOM FOR SMALLER SCALE

00:32:44.295 --> 00:32:46.297
PRODUCTION COMPARED -- TO YEARS

00:32:46.364 --> 00:32:48.032
PAST YOU CAN SEE THE FASHION

00:32:48.099 --> 00:32:51.002
DECLINE THAT'S MANUFACTURING.

00:32:51.069 --> 00:32:52.870
OF SOMEWHAT ARGUE THAT IT MAY BE --

00:32:52.937 --> 00:32:54.639
DUE TO THE INCREASES IN THE

00:32:54.706 --> 00:32:55.773
MINIMUM WAGE AT THE STATE AND

00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:57.608
LOCAL LEVEL -- BUT THERE WERE

00:32:57.675 --> 00:32:59.744
OTHER FORCES ALREADY UNDER WAY

00:32:59.811 --> 00:33:01.045
THAT HAVE DRIVEN THAT -- THAT

00:33:01.112 --> 00:33:04.615
DECLINE I'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT

00:33:04.682 --> 00:33:05.817
THAT FOR SEVERAL YEARS -- BUT DO

00:33:05.883 --> 00:33:06.417
KEEP IN MIND THAT THE DESIGN

00:33:06.484 --> 00:33:07.585
ASPECT CONTINUES TO BE FRONT AND

00:33:07.652 --> 00:33:09.220
CENTER IN PLACES LIKE THE BAY

00:33:09.287 --> 00:33:10.688
AREA AND IN LA.

00:33:10.755 --> 00:33:12.790
IN ORANGE COUNTY BECAUSE IT'S

00:33:12.857 --> 00:33:14.992
THAT CREATIVE COMPONENT THAT YOU

00:33:15.059 --> 00:33:16.427
KNOW DIFFERENTIATES CALIFORNIA'S.

00:33:16.494 --> 00:33:18.529
ECONOMY AND THE SECTORS OF THE

00:33:18.596 --> 00:33:20.398
CALIFORNIA ECONOMY FROM THE REST

00:33:20.465 --> 00:33:21.866
OF THE WORLD WE ACTUALLY DO

00:33:21.933 --> 00:33:24.135
CHECK. TO SEE HOW WE STACK UP

00:33:24.202 --> 00:33:25.770
AGAINST NEW YORK STATE AND I

00:33:25.837 --> 00:33:28.106
GUESS THE THE NEW YORK CITY

00:33:28.172 --> 00:33:31.376
REGION AND WE CAN SAFELY SAY

00:33:31.442 --> 00:33:33.144
WERE THEIR CREATIVE CAPITAL.

00:33:33.211 --> 00:33:34.579
OF THE UNITED STATES.

00:33:34.645 --> 00:33:35.713

00:33:47.225 --> 00:33:48.393
IMPORTANT TO THIS WORK LIKE

00:33:48.459 --> 00:33:51.462
WRITERS PRODUCERS AGENTS OR WE

00:34:03.875 --> 00:34:05.710
INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS OR THAT

00:34:05.777 --> 00:34:08.079
THEY ARE NOT EMPLOYEES OF SOME

00:34:08.146 --> 00:34:10.248

TO ITS JOB COUNTS.

00:34:31.335 --> 00:34:32.870
THIS IS AN AREA THAT IS VERY

00:34:32.937 --> 00:34:35.540
MUCH TIED TO THE UPS AND DOWNS

00:34:35.606 --> 00:34:38.376
OF ECONOMIC CYCLES --

00:34:38.443 --> 00:34:40.178
PHILANTHROPIC ACTIVITIES ALSO

00:34:40.244 --> 00:34:42.346
VERY MUCH TIED TO THE UPS AND

00:34:42.413 --> 00:34:44.248
DOWNS OF ECONOMIC CYCLES SO.

00:34:44.315 --> 00:34:46.184
THE FACT THAT WE ARE NOW SEVERAL

00:34:46.250 --> 00:34:47.385
YEARS INTO THIS ECONOMIC

00:34:47.452 --> 00:34:48.786
EXPANSION AND WE'RE GENERALLY

CERTAINLY GOOD TO SEE YEAH.

00:34:56.861 --> 00:34:58.262
PLAY A ROLE IN THE CALCULATION

00:34:58.329 --> 00:35:00.965
FOR FINER.

00:35:01.032 --> 00:35:03.568
AUCTION HOUSES.

SURE WHERE THEY HAPPEN TO BE I'M

00:35:06.504 --> 00:35:08.306
THINKING THAT THERE AND SOME

00:35:08.372 --> 00:35:13.144
PART OF SALES -- OF ART SO.

00:35:13.211 --> 00:35:13.778
I HAVE TO TAKE A LOOK THANK YOU

00:35:13.845 --> 00:35:15.246
FOR THAT.

00:35:15.313 --> 00:35:16.948
WAGES ARE GENERALLY HIGHER IN

00:35:17.014 --> 00:35:19.317
EACH OF THE CREATIVE SECTORS --

00:35:19.383 --> 00:35:21.152
COMPARED.

00:35:21.219 --> 00:35:22.887
TO THE ECONOMY OVERALL THIS

00:35:22.954 --> 00:35:24.155
HAPPENS TO BE A COMPARISON OF

00:35:24.222 --> 00:35:27.291
CALIFORNIA AGAINST LA COUNTY --

00:35:27.358 --> 00:35:28.593
JUST SO YOU CAN SEE OTHER TO

00:35:28.659 --> 00:35:30.027
STACK UP AND KEEP IN MIND THAT

00:35:30.094 --> 00:35:31.562
THE AVERAGE WAGE BASED ON THE

00:35:31.629 --> 00:35:33.164
DATA THAT WERE USING FOR THIS --

00:35:33.231 --> 00:35:34.832
REAP MOST OF THIS REPORT THE

00:35:34.899 --> 00:35:36.734
AVERAGE WAGE IN CALIFORNIA IN

00:35:36.801 --> 00:35:38.102
TWENTY SEVENTEEN WAS ABOUT SIXTY

00:35:38.169 --> 00:35:39.770
SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS.

00:35:39.837 --> 00:35:41.439
OKAY SO WE DIDN'T JUST LOOK AT

00:35:41.506 --> 00:35:42.573
INDUSTRIES WE ALSO LOOKED AT

00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:43.808
OCCUPATIONS AND WE USE A

00:35:43.875 --> 00:35:44.675
DIFFERENT DATA SOURCE

00:35:44.742 --> 00:35:47.311
SPECIFICALLY ON OCCUPATIONS.

00:35:47.378 --> 00:35:49.113
TO CALL THIS OUT AND OUT WHILE

00:35:49.180 --> 00:35:50.748
WE DO TALK ABOUT THE CREATIVE

00:35:50.815 --> 00:35:52.617
ECONOMY AND AND LARGELY TALK

00:35:52.683 --> 00:35:54.218
ABOUT THOSE INDUSTRIES WE ALSO

00:35:54.285 --> 00:35:56.187
SPEND TIME IN THE REPORT AND

00:35:56.254 --> 00:35:56.554

WITH THIS FIGURE TELLS US IS

00:36:01.225 --> 00:36:02.360
THAT.

00:36:02.426 --> 00:36:03.761
NOT EVERY INDUSTRY SOME

00:36:03.828 --> 00:36:05.630
INDUSTRIES ARE CREATIVE OTHERS

00:36:05.696 --> 00:36:06.330
ARE NOT.

00:36:06.397 --> 00:36:08.466
SOME OCCUPATIONS ARE CREATIVE

00:36:08.533 --> 00:36:10.201
OTHERS ARE NOT I HATE TO SAY IT

00:36:10.268 --> 00:36:15.439
THAT WAY -- AND SO.

00:36:15.506 --> 00:36:17.408
WHAT YOU FIND IS THAT THERE ARE

00:36:17.475 --> 00:36:18.776
CREATIVE OCCUPATIONS IN NON

00:36:18.843 --> 00:36:20.811
CREATIVE INDUSTRIES AND VICE

ORCHESTRA AND NOW BY THE SAME

00:36:31.222 --> 00:36:32.857
TOKEN FOR AN ACCOUNTING FIRM HE

PUBLICATIONS AND SO ON SO.

00:36:37.328 --> 00:36:38.896
WHERE WE WERE JUST TRYING TO

00:36:38.963 --> 00:36:41.999
SPELL THAT OUT AND -- YOU KNOW.

00:36:42.066 --> 00:36:43.701
THIS IS SO IMPORTANT I THINK --

00:36:43.768 --> 00:36:45.169
YOU KNOW I HAVE COLLEGE AGE KIDS

00:36:45.236 --> 00:36:46.904
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THEIR

00:36:46.971 --> 00:36:48.372
FUTURE IS GOING TO LOOK LIKE.

00:36:48.439 --> 00:36:50.274
AN AFGHAN ANYONE WHO'S THINKING

00:36:50.341 --> 00:36:52.009
ABOUT AN OCCUPATION WE WE HEARD

00:36:52.076 --> 00:36:53.678
THESE STORIES ABOUT THE RECENT

00:36:53.744 --> 00:36:54.679
GRADUATES FROM LOTUS.

00:36:54.745 --> 00:36:55.713
YOU KNOW TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

00:36:55.780 --> 00:36:57.114
WHERE THEIR PLACE WILL BE IN

00:36:57.181 --> 00:36:59.216
THIS WORLD AND UNDERSTANDING

00:36:59.283 --> 00:37:01.085
THAT YOU CAN BE A CREATIVE BUT

00:37:01.152 --> 00:37:02.186
MAYBE FIND.

00:37:02.253 --> 00:37:03.788
EMPLOYMENT NOT JUST IN THE

00:37:03.854 --> 00:37:05.456
CREATIVE SECTOR BUT ELSEWHERE IS

00:37:05.523 --> 00:37:08.059
SO IMPORTANT -- TO UNDERSTANDING

00:37:08.125 --> 00:37:09.660
THE THE LANDSCAPE [inaudible]

00:37:09.727 --> 00:37:13.097
SO [inaudible]

00:37:13.164 --> 00:37:15.366
YEAH RIGHT.

00:37:15.433 --> 00:37:17.735
AND SO VERY QUICKLY THE THE

00:37:17.802 --> 00:37:19.337
TRENDS THAT WE IT.

00:37:19.403 --> 00:37:21.939
EXAMINE SHOWED THAT -- WE TEND

00:37:22.006 --> 00:37:22.840
TO HAVE.

00:37:22.907 --> 00:37:24.342
AN INCREASING NUMBER OF HIGH

00:37:24.408 --> 00:37:26.310
SCHOOL GRADUATES AND COLLEGE

00:37:26.377 --> 00:37:27.712
GRADUATES IN THE CREATIVE

00:37:27.778 --> 00:37:30.414
INDUSTRIES -- OVER TIME WE'VE

00:37:30.481 --> 00:37:33.484
SEEN A GROWTH AND GROWTH IN THE

00:37:33.551 --> 00:37:35.219
LEVEL OF ACADEMIC ATTAINMENT

00:37:35.286 --> 00:37:36.320
AMONG THOSE WORKING IN THE

00:37:36.387 --> 00:37:37.121
INDUSTRIES.

00:37:37.188 --> 00:37:38.889
AND ALSO IF WE WERE TO COMPARE

00:37:38.956 --> 00:37:40.424
THE CREATIVE INDUSTRIES AGAINST

00:37:40.491 --> 00:37:43.461
THE NON CREATIVE INDUSTRIES --

00:37:43.527 --> 00:37:44.996
WE WOULD FIND HIGHER LEVELS OF

00:37:45.062 --> 00:37:46.497
EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT IN THE

00:37:46.564 --> 00:37:48.432
CREATIVE INDUSTRIES -- DIVERSITY

00:37:48.499 --> 00:37:50.601
IS SOMETHING WE EXAMINED -- THE

00:37:50.668 --> 00:37:52.703
SHARE OF WOMEN ANY -- SECTORS OF

00:37:52.770 --> 00:37:53.838
THE CREATIVE INDUSTRY IS NOT A

00:37:53.904 --> 00:37:56.841
WHOLE LOT DIFFERENT IN.

00:37:56.907 --> 00:37:59.543
TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN COMPARED --

00:37:59.610 --> 00:38:01.278
TO TEN TWO THOUSAND TEN OR TWO

00:38:01.345 --> 00:38:01.879
THOUSAND SEVEN ABOUT 40% OF AL

00:38:01.946 --> 00:38:05.316
WORKERS -- THERE'S SOME SLIGHT

00:38:05.383 --> 00:38:07.418
IMPROVEMENT IN THE EARNINGS ON

00:38:07.485 --> 00:38:08.352
THE PART OF WOMEN RELATIVE TO

00:38:08.419 --> 00:38:08.853
MEN.

00:38:08.919 --> 00:38:11.255
BUT IT IS REALLY A A PRETTY

00:38:11.322 --> 00:38:12.790
CONSISTENT REFLECTION OF WHAT

00:38:12.857 --> 00:38:14.291
WE'RE SEEING IN THE GENERAL

00:38:14.358 --> 00:38:15.626
ECONOMY AT THE PRESENT TIME.

00:38:15.693 --> 00:38:17.928
AND WITH RESPECT TO ETHNICITY I

00:38:17.995 --> 00:38:19.997
THINK -- YOU KNOW THEY'RE NOT

00:38:20.064 --> 00:38:23.634
HUGE CHANGES IN THE SHARES OF OF

00:38:23.701 --> 00:38:25.169
MINORITIES WHO ARE IN.

00:38:25.236 --> 00:38:28.272
THE CREATIVE ECONOMY -- AND NOR

00:38:28.339 --> 00:38:30.241
ANY BIG CHANGE IN THE SHARE OF

00:38:30.307 --> 00:38:32.009
WHITE NON HISPANICS SO THAT'S

00:38:32.076 --> 00:38:34.045
WHY IT'S IT'S EVOLVING WITH THE

00:38:34.111 --> 00:38:35.012
STATEWIDE WORKFORCE.

00:38:35.079 --> 00:38:36.313
PRETTY CONSISTENT WITH WHAT

00:38:36.380 --> 00:38:38.816
WE'VE SEEN. FOR THE STATE AS A

00:38:38.883 --> 00:38:39.917
WHOLE.

00:38:39.984 --> 00:38:41.285
YOU LOOK AT COLLEGE DEBT.

00:38:41.352 --> 00:38:42.319
WE DID NOT WE DID NOT LOOK AT

00:38:42.386 --> 00:38:43.821
COLLEGE THAT WE JUST LOOKED AT

00:38:43.888 --> 00:38:45.790
THE LOW.

00:38:45.856 --> 00:38:47.525
THE EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT.

00:38:47.591 --> 00:38:49.427
USING AMERICAN COMMUNITY SURVEY

00:38:49.493 --> 00:38:51.595
DATA WHICH SHOWS AS A PEOPLE --

00:38:51.662 --> 00:38:55.766
BY OCCUPATION AND BY EDUCATIONAL.

00:38:55.833 --> 00:38:57.301
SO THERE'S THIS BROADER -- ECO

00:38:57.368 --> 00:38:58.202
SYSTEM THE CREATIVE AN ECO

00:38:58.269 --> 00:39:00.304
SYSTEM THAT WE I WHICH WE'VE

00:39:00.371 --> 00:39:01.639
BEEN SPENDING A LOT OF TIME ON

00:39:01.706 --> 00:39:02.673
THE TOP ONE COMMERCIAL AND

00:39:02.740 --> 00:39:04.875
BUSINESS A LITTLE BIT LESS ON

00:39:04.942 --> 00:39:06.343
SOMEWHAT LESS ON THE NONPROFIT

00:39:06.410 --> 00:39:08.345
ARTS ORGANIZATIONS BUT WE DO TO

00:39:08.412 --> 00:39:10.448
DELVE INTO THAT.

00:39:10.514 --> 00:39:12.149
A LITTLE BIT MORE IN THE REPORT.

00:39:12.216 --> 00:39:13.451
EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS

00:39:13.517 --> 00:39:14.819
GOVERNMENT POLICY MAKERS AND THE

00:39:14.885 --> 00:39:16.687
PHILANTHROPIC COMMUNITY EACH OF

00:39:16.754 --> 00:39:19.023
THESE WE TOUCH ON IN THE REPORT --

00:39:19.090 --> 00:39:21.025
AND IN THE INTEREST OF TIME JUST

00:39:21.092 --> 00:39:22.059
SPEND A LITTLE BIT OF TIME ON

00:39:22.126 --> 00:39:24.628
EACH WE LOOKED AT AND ESTABLISH

00:39:24.695 --> 00:39:25.830
THAT THERE WERE.

00:39:25.896 --> 00:39:28.232
OVER -- ELEVEN THOUSAND

00:39:28.299 --> 00:39:29.366
ESTABLISHMENTS IN.

00:39:29.433 --> 00:39:30.968
THE ARTS CULTURE AND HUMANITIES

00:39:31.035 --> 00:39:33.237
SEGMENT OF THE OF THE CALIFORNIA

00:39:33.304 --> 00:39:36.040
ECONOMY WITH OVER -- EIGHTEEN

00:39:36.107 --> 00:39:37.875
BILLION DOLLARS IN ASSETS SO

00:39:37.942 --> 00:39:40.711
HERE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT -- IN

00:39:40.778 --> 00:39:44.515
ANY ENTITY THAT HAD TO FILE A A

00:39:44.582 --> 00:39:46.517
NON PROFIT REPORT ESSENTIALLY

00:39:46.584 --> 00:39:47.318
WITH.

00:39:47.384 --> 00:39:49.620
THE IRS AND SO THERE ARE MANY

00:39:49.687 --> 00:39:51.789
SMALL NON PROFITS THAT HAVE

00:39:51.856 --> 00:39:53.090
RECEIPTS THAT ARE FAR.

00:39:53.157 --> 00:39:55.025
TOO SMALL. FOR REPORTING

00:39:55.092 --> 00:39:57.762
PURPOSES SO THE ELEVEN THOUSAND

00:39:57.828 --> 00:39:59.764
ESTABLISHMENT COUNTY IS PROBABLY

00:39:59.830 --> 00:40:01.599
A GROSS UNDERESTIMATE.

00:40:01.665 --> 00:40:02.800
THE NUMBER OF ASSETS YOU KNOW

00:40:02.867 --> 00:40:05.336
MOST OF THE ASSET BASE IS GOING

00:40:05.402 --> 00:40:06.704
TO BE FOUND IN LARGE.

00:40:06.771 --> 00:40:09.340
INSTITUTIONS LIKE MUSEUMS AND

00:40:09.406 --> 00:40:10.875
THEATERS AND THINGS LIKE THAT SO

00:40:10.941 --> 00:40:12.510
THAT'S PROBABLY PRETTY CLOSE TO

00:40:12.576 --> 00:40:13.310
THE MARK.

00:40:13.377 --> 00:40:14.845
AND HE RECEIPTS ARE PROBABLY A

00:40:14.912 --> 00:40:16.380
LITTLE BIT OF AN UNDERESTIMATE

00:40:16.447 --> 00:40:17.748
AGAIN BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT

00:40:17.815 --> 00:40:19.350
WE WERE UNDER REPRESENTING.

00:40:19.416 --> 00:40:23.721
THE THE VERY SMALL -- ENTITIES

00:40:23.788 --> 00:40:24.789
THAT ARE PART OF THIS

00:40:24.855 --> 00:40:25.089
[inaudible]

00:40:25.156 --> 00:40:26.757
UP.

00:40:26.824 --> 00:40:28.492
WITH RESPECT TO ARTS EDUCATION

00:40:28.559 --> 00:40:30.294
WE'VE SEEN SOME IMPROVEMENT OVER

00:40:30.361 --> 00:40:32.863
THIS TIME SPAN FROM TWO THOUSAND

00:40:32.930 --> 00:40:34.064
TO TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN IN

00:40:34.131 --> 00:40:36.433
TERMS OF F. T. E. EQUIVALENT SO

00:40:36.500 --> 00:40:39.069
THAT'S THE THE NUMBER OF FACULTY --

00:40:39.136 --> 00:40:40.337
AVERAGE CLASS SIZE HAS ACTUALLY

00:40:40.404 --> 00:40:43.007
DECREASED OVER THAT TIME SPAN --

00:40:43.073 --> 00:40:44.708
AND ENROLLMENTS HAVE HAVE

00:40:44.775 --> 00:40:46.477
ACTUALLY DECLINED PART OF THAT I

00:40:46.544 --> 00:40:48.045
WOULD SAY HAS TO DO WITH THE

00:40:48.112 --> 00:40:49.580
SHEER DEMOGRAPHICS READ APPOINT

00:40:49.647 --> 00:40:50.915
TIME AS I'M SURE YOU KNOW.

00:40:50.981 --> 00:40:53.551
WHERE CALIFORNIA'S K. THROUGH --

00:40:53.617 --> 00:40:55.519
TWELVE POPULATION IS ACTUALLY

00:40:55.586 --> 00:40:56.854
FLAT OR DECLINING AND WILL

00:40:56.921 --> 00:40:59.723
CONTINUE TO DO SO FOR THE NEXT

00:40:59.790 --> 00:41:01.458
SEVERAL YEARS.

00:41:01.525 --> 00:41:04.094
OKAY SO -- THE ECONOMIC IMPACT

00:41:04.161 --> 00:41:05.763
WHICH IS REALLY.

00:41:05.830 --> 00:41:07.164
IT'S NOT THE CENTRAL REASON WHY

00:41:07.231 --> 00:41:09.233
THIS STUDY IS BEING DONE I THINK

00:41:09.300 --> 00:41:10.301
JUST UNDERSTANDING THE THE

00:41:10.367 --> 00:41:11.368
CONNECTIONS AND ALL THESE

00:41:11.435 --> 00:41:13.671
DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES -- IT IS

00:41:13.737 --> 00:41:15.706
QUITE IMPORTANT BUT THIS MIGHT

00:41:15.773 --> 00:41:16.707
BE CALLED THE ICING ON THE CAKE

00:41:16.774 --> 00:41:18.776
SO WHEN WE DO AN ECONOMIC IMPACT

00:41:18.843 --> 00:41:20.277
ANALYSIS OF AN INDUSTRY.

00:41:20.344 --> 00:41:21.812
OR ANYTHING ELSE WE MEASURE THE

00:41:21.879 --> 00:41:24.582
IMPACT IN TERMS OF JOBS WAGES AN

00:41:24.648 --> 00:41:25.349
OUTPUT.

00:41:25.416 --> 00:41:27.585
WHAT WE DO IS WE TRY TO TRACE

00:41:27.651 --> 00:41:28.285
THE RIPPLE EFFECT THROUGH THE

00:41:28.352 --> 00:41:31.422
ECONOMY OF THE ACTIVITIES THAT?

00:41:31.488 --> 00:41:32.022
KICKED IT ALL OFF SO IN THIS

00:41:32.089 --> 00:41:32.723
CASE.

00:41:32.790 --> 00:41:34.792
THE ACTIVITIES ARE OF THOSE FIVE

00:41:34.859 --> 00:41:37.261
MAJOR -- INDUSTRY GROUPS AND

00:41:37.328 --> 00:41:39.129
THEIR THEIR COMPONENT INDUSTRIES

00:41:39.196 --> 00:41:40.664
WE USE THE JOB COUNTS FROM EACH

00:41:40.731 --> 00:41:43.133
OF THOSE INDUSTRIES AS THE

00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:44.235
TRIGGER IF YOU WILL [inaudible]

00:41:44.301 --> 00:41:48.372
THAT -- REPRESENTS HIS INITIAL --

00:41:48.439 --> 00:41:50.107
STIMULUS TO THE LOCAL AND STATE

00:41:50.174 --> 00:41:51.942
ECONOMY -- WHICH IS CALLED THE

00:41:52.009 --> 00:41:53.244
DIRECT EFFECT.

00:41:53.310 --> 00:41:55.145
AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS IS -- YOU

00:41:55.212 --> 00:41:57.181
THINK OF SUPPLY CHAIN AND YOU

00:41:57.248 --> 00:41:59.183
THINK OF WHAT WHAT HAPPENS WHEN.

00:41:59.250 --> 00:42:01.552
LET'S SAY A MUSEUM OR THEATER

00:42:01.619 --> 00:42:03.354
DECIDES THAT HE NEEDS TO REMODEL

00:42:03.420 --> 00:42:05.723
ITS FOR YANG ITS IT'S IT'S LOBBY.

00:42:05.789 --> 00:42:06.824
SO IT'S GONNA HIGHER

00:42:06.891 --> 00:42:08.058
CONSTRUCTION COMPANY AND THAT

00:42:08.125 --> 00:42:09.493
CONSTRUCTION COMPANIES IN TURN

00:42:09.560 --> 00:42:12.329
GOING TO TURN TO ITS SUPPLIERS.

00:42:12.396 --> 00:42:13.964
TO REQUISITIONMATERIALS AND SO

00:42:14.031 --> 00:42:15.833
ON THAT'S THAT INDIRECT EFFECT

00:42:15.900 --> 00:42:17.368
SO THAT'S THE FIRST THE NEXT

00:42:17.434 --> 00:42:19.036
STEP IN THAT RIPPLE EFFECT

00:42:19.103 --> 00:42:20.504
THROUGH THE GENERAL ECONOMY.

00:42:20.571 --> 00:42:22.907
MEANWHILE BOTH THE MUSEUM AND

00:42:22.973 --> 00:42:24.208
THE CONSTRUCTION FIRM HAVE

00:42:24.275 --> 00:42:26.577
EMPLOYEES AND THOSE WORKERS

00:42:26.644 --> 00:42:29.079
EARNED WAGES THAT THEY SPEND --

00:42:29.146 --> 00:42:30.414
THE SPENDING OUT OF THAT WAGES

00:42:30.481 --> 00:42:31.615
OUT OF THOSE WAGES THAT ENTERS

00:42:31.682 --> 00:42:33.450
THE STATEWIDE ECONOMY IS THE SO

00:42:33.517 --> 00:42:34.818
CALLED INDUCED TO FACT.

00:42:34.885 --> 00:42:36.720
SO WE TRACK EACH OF THOSE USING

00:42:36.787 --> 00:42:38.289
A MODEL OF THE STATE ECONOMY

00:42:38.355 --> 00:42:39.957
THAT HAS SEVERAL HUNDRED

00:42:40.024 --> 00:42:40.758
INDUSTRIES.

00:42:40.824 --> 00:42:43.027
AND SO WHAT WE GET IS THAT WHEN

00:42:43.093 --> 00:42:46.230
WE START WITH A MILLION JOBS

00:42:46.297 --> 00:42:48.599
PLUS -- THROUGH THIS RIPPLE

00:42:48.666 --> 00:42:50.534
EFFECT IT -- RESULT IN TWO POINT

00:42:50.601 --> 00:42:52.336
SIX MILLION JOBS OVER ALL THAT

00:42:52.403 --> 00:42:54.538
ARE -- CREATED DIRECTLY OR

00:42:54.605 --> 00:42:56.340
INDIRECTLY -- IN ON THE FAR

00:42:56.407 --> 00:42:58.342
RIGHT HAND SIDE THE OUTPUT

00:42:58.409 --> 00:43:00.344
IMPACT SO WE'VE GOT AN ECONOMY

00:43:00.411 --> 00:43:02.212
THE STATE ECONOMY AS YOU KNOW IS

00:43:02.279 --> 00:43:05.516
THE FIFTH LARGEST IN THE WORLD --

00:43:05.582 --> 00:43:07.017
LITTLE OVER TWO TRILLION DOLLARS

00:43:07.084 --> 00:43:11.755
OF ANNUAL ECONOMIC OUTPUT -- WE

00:43:11.822 --> 00:43:13.490
START WITH THE OUTPUT THIS

00:43:13.557 --> 00:43:14.792
IMPLIED BY THOSE ONE MILLION

00:43:14.858 --> 00:43:17.428
JOBS THREE HUNDRED FIFTY FOUR

00:43:17.494 --> 00:43:18.429
POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS.

00:43:18.495 --> 00:43:20.497
BUT THROUGH THIS RIPPLE EFFECT --

00:43:20.564 --> 00:43:23.968
ABOUT -- HALF OF I'M SORRY HALF

00:43:24.034 --> 00:43:25.669
A TRILLION DOLLARS.

00:43:25.736 --> 00:43:28.439
OF ECONOMIC OUTPUT RESULTS FROM

00:43:28.505 --> 00:43:29.840
THIS CREATIVE ECONOMIES WHO WERE

00:43:29.907 --> 00:43:31.575
TALKING ABOUT ABOUT ONE QUARTER

00:43:31.642 --> 00:43:33.177
OF THE ECONOMY ULTIMATELY THAT

00:43:33.243 --> 00:43:35.179
IS TOUCH SO IT'S NOT WE CAN'T

00:43:35.245 --> 00:43:37.114
CLAIM ALL OF THAT.

00:43:37.181 --> 00:43:37.948
YOU KNOW THAT THE THAT THE

00:43:38.015 --> 00:43:39.249
CREATIVE ECONOMY START WITH

00:43:39.316 --> 00:43:40.918
THOSE MILLION ONE MILLION JOBS

00:43:40.985 --> 00:43:42.052
BUT THERE'S A CONTRIBUTION

00:43:42.119 --> 00:43:43.754
AFFECT TO THE TO THE REST OF THE

00:43:43.821 --> 00:43:44.521
ECONOMY.

00:43:44.588 --> 00:43:45.656
THAT AMOUNTS TO TWO POINT SIX

00:43:45.723 --> 00:43:47.391
MILLION JOBS AND A HALF TRILLION

00:43:47.458 --> 00:43:50.461
DOLLARS WHICH BY ANY MEASURE IS

00:43:50.527 --> 00:43:52.796
AN IMPRESSIVE NUMBER.

00:43:52.863 --> 00:43:55.165
SO ARE A LOT OF INFORMATION TO

00:43:55.232 --> 00:43:57.001
HAVE PRESENTED TO YOU ODAY I

00:43:57.067 --> 00:43:59.236
THINK WE NEED TO TAKE -- GO GO

00:43:59.303 --> 00:44:00.971
BACK TO YOU KNOW THE FUNDAMENTAL

00:44:01.038 --> 00:44:02.639
REASON WHY WE'RE MEETING HERE

00:44:02.706 --> 00:44:03.874
TODAY WE HAVE.

00:44:03.941 --> 00:44:07.344
THIS -- THIS ARTS COMMUNITY.

00:44:07.411 --> 00:44:08.979
ARTS EDUCATION HAS ALWAYS BEEN

00:44:09.046 --> 00:44:10.814
PART AND PARCEL OF EDUCATION IN

00:44:10.881 --> 00:44:14.518
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- I I

00:44:14.585 --> 00:44:16.420
JUST AND AND SO I SAY LARGE AND

00:44:16.487 --> 00:44:17.888
SMALL WE'VE GOT A CON I AN

00:44:17.955 --> 00:44:19.957
ORGANIZATION AS LARGE AS THE LA

00:44:20.024 --> 00:44:21.191
COUNTY MUSEUM OF ART.

00:44:21.258 --> 00:44:21.925
THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT HERE

00:44:21.992 --> 00:44:23.927
TODAY AND I JUST HAPPEN TO FIND

00:44:23.994 --> 00:44:25.262
IN ALPINE COUNTY WHICH IS THE

00:44:25.329 --> 00:44:26.764
SMALLEST BY POPULATION HERE IN

00:44:26.830 --> 00:44:27.498
THE STATE THEY HAVE SOMETHING

00:44:27.564 --> 00:44:28.999
CALLED THE BEAR VALLEY MUSIC

00:44:29.066 --> 00:44:30.434
FESTIVAL THAT OCCURS EVERY YEAR.

00:44:30.501 --> 00:44:31.168
SO.

00:44:31.235 --> 00:44:32.136
YOU KNOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE

00:44:32.202 --> 00:44:33.604
ENTIRE GAMUT OF CREATIVE

00:44:33.670 --> 00:44:36.407
ACTIVITIES AND CULTURAL

00:44:36.473 --> 00:44:38.509
ACTIVITIES -- IVORY ITED A

00:44:38.575 --> 00:44:39.877
NUMBER OF NUMBERS SEVERAL

00:44:39.943 --> 00:44:43.147
NUMBERS WHAT WE DO IS OR WHAT.

00:44:43.213 --> 00:44:43.614
THROUGH THE THROUGH A

00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:44.648
CONVERSATION THEY WERE PUTTING A

00:44:44.715 --> 00:44:47.117
FACE ON THOSE NUMBERS AS WELL.

00:44:47.184 --> 00:44:49.086
AND TALKING ABOUT HOW IMPORTANT

00:44:49.153 --> 00:44:51.922
IS -- IT'LL CONTINUE TO BE A

00:44:51.989 --> 00:44:53.991
DYNAMIC FORCE -- IT IN AND OF

00:44:54.058 --> 00:44:54.525
ITSELF.

00:44:54.591 --> 00:44:56.293
BUT IN SO MANY WAYS IT'S

00:44:56.360 --> 00:44:57.728
AFFECTING THE OTHER INDUSTRIES

00:44:57.795 --> 00:44:59.263
THAT WE HAVE.

00:44:59.329 --> 00:45:00.731
THE BETTER -- SO KEY TO OUR

00:45:00.798 --> 00:45:02.800
STATE WIDE ECONOMY AND I'LL JUST

00:45:02.866 --> 00:45:04.401
CLOSE BY SAYING YOU KNOW WE'VE

00:45:04.468 --> 00:45:06.170
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT STEM TO STEAM

00:45:06.236 --> 00:45:07.538
FOR MANY YEARS NOW.

00:45:07.604 --> 00:45:08.672
AND I THINK IT BECOMES MORE AND

00:45:08.739 --> 00:45:11.508
MORE APPARENT AS TIME PASSES HOW.

00:45:11.575 --> 00:45:14.578
THESE TWO ARE LINKED -- THE THE

00:45:14.645 --> 00:45:17.915
TACK ENGINEERING MATHEMATICS.

00:45:17.981 --> 00:45:19.316
OUR LINK TO THE ART SIDE OF THE

00:45:19.383 --> 00:45:20.651
WORLD [inaudible]

00:45:20.717 --> 00:45:24.221
AND THAT'S MORE TRUE HERE IN

00:45:24.288 --> 00:45:25.923
CALIFORNIA I THINK THAN ANY

00:45:25.989 --> 00:45:28.058
PLACE ELSE ON THE PLANET.

00:45:28.125 --> 00:45:29.159
SO ON THAT NOTE I WILL SAY THANK

00:45:29.226 --> 00:45:35.332
YOU -- THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK

00:45:35.399 --> 00:45:39.503
YOU THANK YOU -- AND WELCOME BY

00:45:39.570 --> 00:45:40.871
THE WAY YEAH.

00:45:40.938 --> 00:45:41.972
YES AS A MEMBER.

00:45:42.039 --> 00:45:45.876
YEAH MICHAEL TODAY I HAD LOTS OF

00:45:45.943 --> 00:45:47.644
COFFEE DOES.

00:45:47.711 --> 00:45:48.879
YOU KNOW SO I'M.

00:45:48.946 --> 00:45:50.848
I ACTUALLY STARTED READING THAT

00:45:50.914 --> 00:45:51.748
REPORT COMING OUT OF OTIS WHEN

00:45:51.815 --> 00:45:53.450
IT FIRST STARTED -- AND SO VERY

00:45:53.517 --> 00:45:55.619
EXCITED ABOUT THIS TOPIC IN THIS

00:45:55.686 --> 00:45:57.421
CONVERSATION YOU KNOW MANY FOLKS

00:45:57.488 --> 00:45:58.255
THAT ARE INVOLVED IN THE

00:45:58.322 --> 00:45:59.523
CREATIVE ECONOMY.

00:45:59.590 --> 00:46:01.959
ARE EITHER SOLE PROPRIETORS OR

00:46:02.025 --> 00:46:04.294
THEY ARE -- OWNERS OF A VERY

00:46:04.361 --> 00:46:06.330
SMALL BUSINESS WITH LESS THAN

00:46:06.396 --> 00:46:07.164
FIVE EMPLOYEES.

00:46:07.231 --> 00:46:09.533
AND SO WONDERING IF IN YOUR SORT

00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:11.435
OF ECONOMIC CONVERSATION IF

00:46:11.502 --> 00:46:13.003
YOU'RE EVER THINKING ABOUT --

00:46:13.070 --> 00:46:14.771
THE TAX BURDEN THAT IS PLACED ON

00:46:14.838 --> 00:46:16.039
MANY OF THESE FOLKS AND WE

00:46:16.106 --> 00:46:17.608
OFTENTIMES OR TALKING ABOUT

00:46:17.674 --> 00:46:19.510
TAXES THE ASSUMPTION IS THAT IT

00:46:19.576 --> 00:46:21.178
CAN BE ABSORBED BECAUSE THE

00:46:21.245 --> 00:46:23.080
INDUSTRY MAKES A TON OF MONEY

00:46:23.147 --> 00:46:24.748
AND IS A HUGE CONTRIBUTOR.

00:46:24.815 --> 00:46:26.650
OR BECAUSE IT'S A BUSINESS THAT

00:46:26.717 --> 00:46:28.418
HAS A NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES AND

00:46:28.485 --> 00:46:29.720
KIND OF WEATHER THE STORM BUT

00:46:29.786 --> 00:46:35.225
FOR MANY SMALL BUSINESSES.

00:46:35.292 --> 00:46:35.859
I'VE BEEN HEARING ON THAT THE

00:46:35.926 --> 00:46:36.527
TAX BURDEN IS BECOMING

00:46:36.593 --> 00:46:38.762
INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT AND SO WE

00:46:38.829 --> 00:46:40.130
THINK ABOUT THAT IN.

00:46:40.197 --> 00:46:41.465
CONNECTION WITH THE FACT THAT

00:46:41.532 --> 00:46:42.499
MANY FOLKS MIGHT BE LEAVING THE

00:46:42.566 --> 00:46:43.567
STATE BECAUSE OF THE

00:46:43.634 --> 00:46:45.202
AFFORDABILITY ISSUE.

00:46:45.269 --> 00:46:47.404
I'M JUST WONDERING IF -- THE TAX

00:46:47.471 --> 00:46:50.207
IMPLICATIONS ARE PART OF YOUR

00:46:50.274 --> 00:46:52.376
THOUGHT PROCESS OR THIS STUDY IN

00:46:52.442 --> 00:46:53.977
AND HOW WE CAN MAYBE BE A LITTLE

00:46:54.044 --> 00:46:55.846
MORE SYMPATHETIC. TO THE

00:46:55.913 --> 00:46:57.347
CHALLENGES THAT THE CREATIVE

00:46:57.414 --> 00:46:59.983
ECONOMY -- YOU KNOW FACES AS IT

00:47:00.050 --> 00:47:01.885
RELATES TO THE TAX BURDEN COMING

00:47:01.952 --> 00:47:02.553
FROM CALIFORNIA.

00:47:02.619 --> 00:47:04.087
BECAUSE I CERTAINLY WOULD WANT

00:47:04.154 --> 00:47:06.156
THOSE JOBS TO GO AWAY RIGHT --

00:47:06.223 --> 00:47:10.294
BUT I CERTAINLY DON'T WANT THEM.

00:47:10.360 --> 00:47:12.062
TO FEEL.

00:47:12.129 --> 00:47:12.629
HAVE A PINCH FEEL MORE LIKE.

00:47:12.696 --> 00:47:15.532
A PUNCH.

00:47:15.599 --> 00:47:17.000
SO I GUESS I WOULD START BY

00:47:17.067 --> 00:47:19.903
SAYING THAT WE COMMONLY HERE

00:47:19.970 --> 00:47:21.605
THAT IN AND IN ADDITION TO BEING

00:47:21.672 --> 00:47:22.839
A CREATIVE CAPITAL.

00:47:22.906 --> 00:47:24.641
AND ATTACK.

00:47:24.708 --> 00:47:25.375
CAPITAL.

00:47:25.442 --> 00:47:28.612
ALSO AN ENTREPRENEURIAL CAPITAL --

00:47:28.679 --> 00:47:30.881
AND THAT'S ALL ABOUT SMALL

00:47:30.948 --> 00:47:33.083
BUSINESS SO WE WE HAVE.

00:47:33.150 --> 00:47:34.351
LARGE NUMBERS OF SMALL BUSINESS

00:47:34.418 --> 00:47:36.053
PEOPLE IN A VARIETY OF

00:47:36.119 --> 00:47:40.023
INDUSTRIES INCLUDING THE ARTS --

00:47:40.090 --> 00:47:43.794
THE FIRST WITH RESPECT TO PEOPLE

00:47:43.860 --> 00:47:45.028
AND BUSINESSES LEAVING

00:47:45.095 --> 00:47:48.031
CALIFORNIA IT'S IT DOES HAPPEN

00:47:48.098 --> 00:47:49.700
YOU KNOW BUT IT'S ALSO WE'VE

00:47:49.766 --> 00:47:50.968
SEEN A NET.

00:47:51.034 --> 00:47:52.769
POSITIVE INCREASE IN.

00:47:52.836 --> 00:47:56.206
IN POPULATION AND SO ON WE HAVE.

00:47:56.273 --> 00:47:58.242
MADE AN OUTSIDE CONTRIBUTION TO

00:47:58.308 --> 00:48:00.110
JOB GROWTH RELATIVE TO THE

00:48:00.177 --> 00:48:01.578
NATION OVER THE LAST SEVERAL

00:48:01.645 --> 00:48:05.015
YEARS SO. FOR ALL OF THE TAXES%

00:48:05.082 --> 00:48:07.851
AND REGULATIONS AND SO ON THAT.

00:48:07.918 --> 00:48:08.885
BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA HAVE TO

00:48:08.952 --> 00:48:10.487
FACE.

00:48:10.554 --> 00:48:13.423
THEY HAVE SOMEHOW MANAGED -- TO

00:48:13.490 --> 00:48:15.459
HELP PERFORM IF YOU WILL AT THE

00:48:15.525 --> 00:48:17.461
STATE LEVEL -- MANY OTHER STATES

00:48:17.527 --> 00:48:19.162
AROUND THE COUNTRY.

00:48:19.229 --> 00:48:20.230
SO I THOUGHT I'D IT'S ALWAYS A

00:48:20.297 --> 00:48:21.565
GOOD IDEA FOR US TO REMIND

00:48:21.632 --> 00:48:23.867
OURSELVES THAT WELL WE WE LIKE

00:48:23.934 --> 00:48:25.235
TO BEAT OURSELVES UP.

00:48:25.302 --> 00:48:26.803
FOR BEING A HIGH COST STATE TO

00:48:26.870 --> 00:48:28.772
DO BUSINESS FOR HAVING HIGH

00:48:28.839 --> 00:48:30.440

FIGURE OUT A WAY TO MAKE THINGS

00:48:35.145 --> 00:48:37.381
HAPPEN AND AND AND MANAGED TO

00:48:37.447 --> 00:48:38.749
SUCCEED IN THE AND THE TRACK

00:48:38.815 --> 00:48:40.050

QUITE GOOD OVER THE LAST COUPLE

00:48:41.285 --> 00:48:42.653
YEARS HAVING SAID ALL THAT I

00:48:42.719 --> 00:48:45.055
THINK YOU KNOW THE WHAT I DON'T

00:48:47.691 --> 00:48:49.192
I HAVE ARE ANECDOTAL

00:48:49.259 --> 00:48:49.493

AND THE RULES OF THE GAME IN THE

00:48:57.467 --> 00:48:59.069
FORM OF TAXATION PERMITTING AND

SO ON ARE FAIRLY CLEAR --

00:49:02.372 --> 00:49:04.341
MANAGEABLE AND YOU KNOW THEY CAN

00:49:04.408 --> 00:49:05.676

CREATIVE ECONOMY THERE OFTEN

00:59:46.816 --> 00:59:47.984
THINKING ABOUT TRADITIONAL

00:59:48.051 --> 00:59:50.486
INSTITUTIONS THAT TEND TO NOT

00:59:50.553 --> 00:59:52.655

STILL A LOT OF WORK TO BE DONE

01:00:03.866 --> 01:00:06.035
TO CONTINUE TO ENSURE THAT THIS

01:00:06.102 --> 01:00:07.470

TODAY.

01:00:10.873 --> 01:00:12.842
THIS HEARING IS FOCUSING ON THE

01:00:12.909 --> 01:00:15.011
EDUCATION PIPELINE AND ALSO ON

01:00:15.078 --> 01:00:16.879
HOW WE LIFT UP YOUTH -- I DO

01:00:16.946 --> 01:00:18.614
HOPE THAT WE HAVE A CONVERSATION

01:00:18.681 --> 01:00:19.649
SPECIFICALLY RUN THE WORKFORCE

01:00:19.716 --> 01:00:20.717
AT SOME POINT.

01:00:20.783 --> 01:00:22.285
ABOUT HOW IS THAT DIFFERENT

01:00:22.352 --> 01:00:23.953
SECTORS OF THE CREATIVE ECONOMY

01:00:24.020 --> 01:00:24.988

DIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AND I

01:00:31.828 --> 01:00:33.796
THINK MY MY QUESTION REALLY IS

01:00:33.863 --> 01:00:35.131
IF THERE ARE ANY INITIAL

01:00:35.198 --> 01:00:36.199
THOUGHTS ON THINGS THAT WE COULD

01:00:36.265 --> 01:00:37.900
BE DOING IN THAT AREA TO MAKE

01:00:37.967 --> 01:00:38.701

ALL ASPECTS OF THE CALIFORNIA

01:00:40.870 --> 01:00:43.573
COMMUNITY AND WHAT IS I THINK

01:00:43.639 --> 01:00:44.407
ONE OF OUR COMPETITIVE

01:00:44.474 --> 01:00:48.277
ADVANTAGES OF A STATE WHICH IS

01:00:48.344 --> 01:00:50.513

OUT I'LL JUST SAY THAT ONE OF

01:00:52.415 --> 01:00:53.549
THE BIGGEST PRIORITIES FOR THE

01:00:53.616 --> 01:00:55.385
ARTS COUNCIL IS THAT CALIFORNIA

01:00:55.451 --> 01:00:57.153
ARTS COUNCIL IS TO MAKE SURE

01:00:57.220 --> 01:00:58.154

01:01:03.559 --> 01:01:05.028
MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES THAT

01:01:05.094 --> 01:01:06.195
ARE MAYBE NOT EVEN [inaudible]

01:01:06.262 --> 01:01:08.431
YOU KNOW.

01:01:08.498 --> 01:01:09.699
THERE ARE ENTERING THE WORK

01:01:09.766 --> 01:01:11.034
FORCE AND THEN NOT EVEN GETTING

01:01:11.100 --> 01:01:12.902
UP INTO LEADERSHIP POSITIONS

01:01:12.969 --> 01:01:14.670

01:01:14.737 --> 01:01:15.705
THAT WE HAVE.

01:01:15.772 --> 01:01:17.407
AND THEN IN OUR GRANTS PORTFOLIO

01:01:17.473 --> 01:01:18.975
OVER ALL.

01:01:19.042 --> 01:01:20.743
WE WE TAKE A LOT OF TIME AND A

01:01:20.810 --> 01:01:22.578
LOT OF CARE AND IT'S A CONSTANT

01:01:22.645 --> 01:01:23.880
ITERATIVE.

01:01:23.946 --> 01:01:26.049
PROCESS FOR US TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:01:26.115 --> 01:01:28.584
WERE WE'RE HELPING TO UP LEFT

01:01:28.651 --> 01:01:30.219
AND IN RICH ALL THE COMMUNITY SO

FOLKS CAN SEE THEMSELVES.

01:01:32.522 --> 01:01:35.024
ANYBODY CAN SEE THEMSELVES IN A

01:01:35.091 --> 01:01:36.125
JOB.

01:01:36.192 --> 01:01:38.661
THAT IS [inaudible]

01:01:38.728 --> 01:01:41.197
MAYBE NORMALLY VIEWED AS PART OF

01:01:41.264 --> 01:01:42.965
THE CREATIVE ECONOMY OR NOT

01:01:43.032 --> 01:01:43.900
NORMALLY VIEWED AS PART OF THE

01:01:43.966 --> 01:01:45.802
GREAT CREATIVE ECONOMY BECAUSE

01:01:45.868 --> 01:01:47.336
I'M ONE OF THOSE.

01:01:47.403 --> 01:01:48.905
FOLKS IT REALLY THINKS IT'S SO

01:01:48.971 --> 01:01:50.473
DIFFICULT TO JUST SAY THIS IS

01:01:50.540 --> 01:01:51.874
CREATIVE ECONOMY WHEN I KNOW

01:01:51.941 --> 01:01:53.943
FULL WELL.

01:01:54.010 --> 01:01:55.745
WHEN I'M TALKING TO BOEING?

01:01:55.812 --> 01:01:57.947
THEY VALUE THEIR CREE HERE IF

01:01:58.014 --> 01:01:58.614
THERE IS.

01:01:58.681 --> 01:02:01.150
AS WE ALL DO WHEN WE GET ON THAT

01:02:01.217 --> 01:02:01.384
PLANE.

01:02:01.451 --> 01:02:02.919
YEAH. TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:02:02.985 --> 01:02:04.487
EVERYTHING.

01:02:04.554 --> 01:02:07.123
YOU KNOW THAT THEY ARE DESIGNED

01:02:07.190 --> 01:02:07.957
TO WELL.

01:02:08.024 --> 01:02:10.126
AND ALL THE SYSTEMS INTERLINK

01:02:10.193 --> 01:02:13.229
WELL AND THAT'S DESIGN AND AND

01:02:13.296 --> 01:02:15.898
THAT'S WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT TO

01:02:15.965 --> 01:02:16.732
KEEP THE A AND STATE.

01:02:16.799 --> 01:02:17.700
THAT THAT'S ONE OF OUR

01:02:17.767 --> 01:02:20.369
PRIORITIES TO MAKE SURE WE REACH

01:02:20.436 --> 01:02:23.039
OUT TO ALL POPULATION.

01:02:23.106 --> 01:02:24.440
IF YOU DON'T MIND -- ME ADDING

01:02:24.507 --> 01:02:27.310
TO THAT THE ONE THING WE DON'T

01:02:27.376 --> 01:02:29.479
TALK ABOUT IN THIS STUDY.

01:02:29.545 --> 01:02:31.614
BUT I THINK THE CONNECTION IS

01:02:31.681 --> 01:02:33.549
FAIRLY CLOSE IS THAT WHEN.

01:02:33.616 --> 01:02:35.084
YOU LOOK AT A CITY LIKE SAN

01:02:35.151 --> 01:02:35.985
FRANCISCO WHERE TOURISM IS SO

01:02:36.052 --> 01:02:38.521
IMPORTANT.

01:02:38.588 --> 01:02:40.790
PEOPLE COME FOR A VISIT SAN

01:02:40.857 --> 01:02:43.526
FRANCISCO. TO YOU KNOW WHAT THE

01:02:43.593 --> 01:02:45.895
GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE -- TO GO TO

01:02:45.962 --> 01:02:47.530
THE MUSEUMS AND THINGS LIKE THAT.

01:02:47.597 --> 01:02:48.965
BUT THEY ALSO STOP.

01:02:49.031 --> 01:02:51.734
AT RESTAURANTS AND THEY STAY IN

01:02:51.801 --> 01:02:53.970
A HOTEL SO TOUR SO THE ARTS.

01:02:54.036 --> 01:02:56.172
REALLY IS A CATALYST IN SOME

01:02:56.239 --> 01:02:57.940
SENSE THAT -- THAT BRINGS

01:02:58.007 --> 01:03:00.643
TOURISM TO OUR COMMUNITIES.

01:03:00.710 --> 01:03:03.513
AND IT AND THE BUSINESSES THAT.

01:03:03.579 --> 01:03:05.515
SERVE THOSE TOURISTS ARE

01:03:05.581 --> 01:03:08.050
BUSINESSES LARGE AND SMALL.

01:03:08.117 --> 01:03:10.119
AND VERY ETHNICALLY DIVERSE.

01:03:10.186 --> 01:03:10.620
BECAUSE PEOPLE COME TO

01:03:10.686 --> 01:03:12.488
CALIFORNIA OR GO TO DIFFERENT

01:03:12.555 --> 01:03:13.289
PARTS OF CALIFORNIA TO

01:03:13.356 --> 01:03:15.057
EXPERIENCE.

01:03:15.124 --> 01:03:16.425
THE NEIGHBORHOODS AND AND ALL

01:03:16.492 --> 01:03:18.227
THAT SO WHEN WE WHEN WE THINK

01:03:18.294 --> 01:03:19.896
ABOUT.

01:03:19.962 --> 01:03:21.464
THE CREATIVE ECONOMY AS AN

01:03:21.531 --> 01:03:25.701
ECONOMIC ENGINE -- IT'S IT'S

01:03:25.768 --> 01:03:26.435
GOOD IDEA TO THANK YOU KNOW IF

01:03:26.502 --> 01:03:27.670
YOU CAN POINT OUT WITH YOUR

01:03:27.737 --> 01:03:30.173
COMMENT ABOUT -- CREATORS IN

01:03:30.239 --> 01:03:32.074
BOEING BOEING IN OUR COMMUNITIES

01:03:32.141 --> 01:03:33.442
WE HAVE THIS THING CALLED

01:03:33.509 --> 01:03:34.443
TOURISM WHICH IS AN IMPORTANT

01:03:34.510 --> 01:03:36.879
CONTRIBUTOR TO THE LOCAL ECONOMY

01:03:36.946 --> 01:03:38.681
AN IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTOR TO

01:03:38.748 --> 01:03:40.583
LOCAL GOVERNMENT REVENUES.

01:03:40.650 --> 01:03:42.018
THROUGH FRIDAY REVENUE STREAMS

01:03:42.084 --> 01:03:44.487
THAT -- REALLY RELIES HEAVILY ON

01:03:44.554 --> 01:03:48.324
ARTS AND CULTURE -- AS A MAGNET

01:03:48.391 --> 01:03:48.925
TO DRAW THOSE TOURISTS IN THE

01:03:48.991 --> 01:03:50.193
FIRST PLACE.

01:03:50.259 --> 01:03:51.194
I THINK ONE THING I'LL JUST

01:03:51.260 --> 01:03:53.663
OBSERVE -- IS THE ARTS AND

01:03:53.729 --> 01:03:55.231
ENTERTAINMENT CREATIVE ECONOMY

01:03:55.298 --> 01:03:58.167
WORLD IS NOT ONE THAT I THINK.

01:03:58.234 --> 01:04:00.236
WITH THE EXCEPTION OF HOLLYWOOD --

01:04:00.303 --> 01:04:03.039
HAS HAD AS MUCH OF A ROLE HERE

01:04:03.105 --> 01:04:04.907
IN SACRAMENTO IN TRYING TO WIN

01:04:04.974 --> 01:04:06.242
FOR POLICIES PRACTICALLY AND HOW

01:04:06.309 --> 01:04:06.943
WE'RE TRYING TO INFLUENCE

01:04:07.009 --> 01:04:09.478
EDUCATION WORKFORCE AS AS I WITH.

01:04:09.545 --> 01:04:11.147
ONE AND SO I WOULD JUST SAY TO

01:04:11.214 --> 01:04:12.148
THE PANELISTS AND AND OTHERS IN

01:04:12.215 --> 01:04:13.783
THE PUBLIC -- AS A MEMBER THIS

01:04:13.849 --> 01:04:14.951
COMMITTEE I'M CERTAINLY LOOKING

01:04:15.017 --> 01:04:16.285
FOR INTERESTING IDEAS AND WHAT

01:04:16.352 --> 01:04:18.521
WE CAN DO. TO SUPPORT THIS

01:04:18.588 --> 01:04:20.022
ECONOMY AND ENSURE THAT IT IS

01:04:20.089 --> 01:04:21.257
REALLY LIFTING UP EVERYONE --

01:04:21.324 --> 01:04:23.593
BECAUSE I DO BELIEVE -- IT IS A

01:04:23.659 --> 01:04:24.293
COMPETITIVE STRENGTH THE

01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:26.529
COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE FOR OUR

01:04:26.596 --> 01:04:29.966

01:21:01.790 --> 01:21:02.924
THERE WAS NO MESS THAT OF

01:21:02.991 --> 01:21:05.961
DISSEMINATING THAT DATA ON JOBS.

01:21:06.027 --> 01:21:07.662
IN ARTS MEDIA AND ENTERTAINMENT.

01:21:07.729 --> 01:21:10.031
WHEN I CAME UP THROUGH SCHOOL --

01:21:10.098 --> 01:21:10.932
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I

01:21:10.999 --> 01:21:12.200
REMEMBER AND MAYBE SOME OF YOU

01:21:12.267 --> 01:21:13.635
REMEMBER TO IS THAT IF YOU WERE

TOLD HIM THAT YOU NEED A BACK UP

01:21:19.140 --> 01:21:20.175
PLAN.

01:21:20.242 --> 01:21:22.377
WELL I THINK THAT LOOKING AT THE

01:21:22.444 --> 01:21:24.279
INFORMATION IN THE ORDERS REPORT

01:21:24.346 --> 01:21:25.213
ONE OF THE THINGS IT'S CLEAR NOW

01:21:25.280 --> 01:21:26.748
IS THAT THE ARTS CAN BE YOUR

01:21:26.815 --> 01:21:28.183
BACKUP PLAN.

01:21:28.250 --> 01:21:30.085
THERE ARE JOBS IN THE ARTS IN

01:21:30.151 --> 01:21:33.355
AND WE PREPARE THOSE STUDENTS IN

01:21:33.421 --> 01:21:34.923

AGRICULTURE AND HEALTH CAREERS

01:22:07.055 --> 01:22:08.123
EDUCATION.

01:22:08.189 --> 01:22:10.492
COMBINED WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE

01:22:10.558 --> 01:22:13.528
NUMBER OF STUDENTS ENROLLED -- I

01:22:13.595 --> 01:22:16.464

STUDENT ENROLLMENT DATA -- AND

01:22:22.537 --> 01:22:23.605
WE WERE WE'RE GOING TO BE

01:22:23.672 --> 01:22:25.106
TALKING ABOUT DATE A LITTLE BIT

01:22:25.173 --> 01:22:27.075
LATER BUT SOME STUDENT ROMAN

01:22:27.142 --> 01:22:29.010
DATA BOTH IN THE ARTS AND IN THE

01:22:29.077 --> 01:22:30.612
ARTS MEDIA AND ENTERTAINMENT

01:22:30.679 --> 01:22:31.946
INDUSTRY SECTORS.

01:22:32.013 --> 01:22:32.981
SO IN ARTS MEDIA AND

01:22:33.048 --> 01:22:34.949
ENTERTAINMENT THERE ARE A

01:22:35.016 --> 01:22:37.018
HUNDRED AND SEVENTEEN THOUSAND

01:22:37.085 --> 01:22:39.354
STUDENTS STATEWIDE INFO ENROLLED

01:22:39.421 --> 01:22:41.323
IN THE DESIGN VISUAL AND MEDIA

01:22:41.389 --> 01:22:42.791
ARTS PATHWAY.

01:22:42.857 --> 01:22:44.659
AND THAT PATHWAY INCLUDES FOLKS

01:22:44.726 --> 01:22:48.663
LIKE PRODUCTION -- DESIGNERS --

01:22:48.730 --> 01:22:52.801
DIRECTORS -- ARTISTS -- MEDIA

01:22:52.867 --> 01:22:58.673
ARTISTS ANIMATORS -- THERE ARE.

01:22:58.740 --> 01:22:59.341
TWENTY SIX THOUSAND STUDENTS

01:22:59.407 --> 01:23:01.009
ENROLLED IN PERFORMING ARTS

01:23:01.076 --> 01:23:05.280

01:23:07.315 --> 01:23:08.183
STUDENTS IN PRODUCTION

01:23:08.249 --> 01:23:09.718
MANAGERIAL ARTS AND THOSE ARE

01:23:09.784 --> 01:23:11.553
BASICALLY THE BELOW THE LINE

01:23:11.619 --> 01:23:13.288
JOBS IN FILM AND TELEVISION THE

01:23:13.355 --> 01:23:15.223
FOLKS WHO WORK BEHIND THE CAMERA

01:23:15.290 --> 01:23:16.524
BEHIND THE SCENES.

01:23:16.591 --> 01:23:18.293
AND THEN FOUR THOUSAND STUDENTS

01:23:18.360 --> 01:23:20.295
IN OUR NEWEST INDUSTRY SECTOR OF

01:23:20.362 --> 01:23:22.897
GAME DESIGN [inaudible]

01:23:22.964 --> 01:23:27.435
SO THE IN THE PAST -- TWELVE

01:23:27.502 --> 01:23:29.871
YEARS THERE'S BEEN A HUGE GROWTH

01:23:29.938 --> 01:23:31.439
IN ART IN ARTS MEDIA AND

01:23:31.506 --> 01:23:33.742
ENTERTAINMENT AND THAT GROWTH.

01:23:33.808 --> 01:23:35.643
IS WHILE I WON'T SAY IT'S

01:23:35.710 --> 01:23:37.912
BECAUSE BY IT CERTAINLY HAS BEEN

01:23:37.979 --> 01:23:40.548
GREATLY SUPPORTED BY THE DATA

01:23:40.615 --> 01:23:42.984
PROVIDED BY THE OLDEST REPORT.

01:23:43.051 --> 01:23:45.253
PRIOR TO TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN

01:23:45.320 --> 01:23:46.354
WHEN I FIRST SAW THE OWNERS

01:23:46.421 --> 01:23:48.656
REPORT THERE WAS NO PUBLIC DATA

01:23:48.723 --> 01:23:50.392
THAT WE COULD POINT TO TO SHOW

01:23:50.458 --> 01:23:52.060
THAT THERE WERE IN FACT JOBS

01:23:52.127 --> 01:23:52.894
HERE.

01:23:52.961 --> 01:23:55.163
BUT THAT OTIS REPORT PROVIDED US

01:23:55.230 --> 01:23:57.732
WITH -- WITH THE ABILITY TO

01:23:57.799 --> 01:23:59.601
SHARE WITH FOLKS THE IMPACT OF

01:23:59.667 --> 01:24:01.836
THE OF THE ARTS ON THE CREATIVE

01:24:01.903 --> 01:24:02.971
ECONOMY.

01:24:03.037 --> 01:24:05.173
THE NUMBER OF JOBS AVAILABLE IN

01:24:05.240 --> 01:24:06.674
THE CREATIVE ECONOMY AND THAT

01:24:06.741 --> 01:24:08.877
CERTAINLY HELPED ME OUT WHEN I

01:24:08.943 --> 01:24:10.478
TALK TO SCHOOL COUNSELORS ABOUT.

01:24:10.545 --> 01:24:12.280
IT URGING STUDENTS TO GO INTO

01:24:12.347 --> 01:24:14.182
THE ARTS RATHER THAN SUPPORTING

01:24:14.249 --> 01:24:15.950
THEM INTO THE ARTS BECAUSE

01:24:16.017 --> 01:24:18.386
THERE'S NO PLACE ELSE FOR THEM --

01:24:18.453 --> 01:24:20.321
AND IT ALSO TALK ABOUT THE ROLE

01:24:20.388 --> 01:24:21.890
OF CREATIVE IN THE CALIFORNIA

01:24:21.956 --> 01:24:23.858
WORK FORCE BECAUSE THAT BECAME

01:24:23.925 --> 01:24:25.827
ABUNDANTLY CLEAR THROUGH LOOKING

01:24:25.894 --> 01:24:27.429
AT THE REPORT.

01:24:27.495 --> 01:24:29.097
SO AS I MENTIONED BEFORE THE

01:24:29.164 --> 01:24:31.366
ARTS MEDIAN ENTERTAINMENT IS NOW

01:24:31.433 --> 01:24:32.767
THE LARGEST INDUSTRY SECTOR IN

01:24:32.834 --> 01:24:35.403
CALIFORNIA EDUCATION -- THERE

01:24:35.470 --> 01:24:37.939
ARE THIRTEEN SUB PATHWAYS WITHIN

01:24:38.006 --> 01:24:40.708
OUR FOR MAJOR PATHWAYS THAT I

01:24:40.775 --> 01:24:44.212
DISCUSSED THAT PEPARE STUDENTS.

01:24:44.279 --> 01:24:45.613
TO TO FOR CAREERS IN MEDIA ARTS

01:24:45.680 --> 01:24:48.516
IN ANIMATION IN GRAPHIC DESIGN

01:24:48.583 --> 01:24:49.884
IN PROFESSIONAL FILL

01:24:49.951 --> 01:24:53.221
PROFESSIONAL FILM IN DANCE --

01:24:53.288 --> 01:24:57.025
THEATER AND MUSIC -- TO SUPPORT

01:24:57.091 --> 01:24:59.060
THE ARTS MEDIA AND ENTERTAINMENT

01:24:59.127 --> 01:25:00.995
EDUCATION WE HAVE ELEVEN MODEL

01:25:01.062 --> 01:25:03.765
DEMONSTRATION SITE PROGRAMS AS

01:25:03.832 --> 01:25:05.467
WE GREW ONE OF THE CHALLENGES

01:25:05.533 --> 01:25:08.069
THAT WE FACED WAS -- HOW ARE WE

01:25:08.136 --> 01:25:10.138
GOING TO BE SURE THAT THE

01:25:10.205 --> 01:25:11.739
QUALITY OF THE PROGRAMS IS HIGH

01:25:11.806 --> 01:25:14.042
QUALITY -- WE HAVE A LOT OF KIDS

01:25:14.108 --> 01:25:15.743
INTEREST IN ROLLING IN PROGRAMS

01:25:15.810 --> 01:25:17.946
AND A LOT OF TEACHERS INTERESTED

01:25:18.012 --> 01:25:19.481
IN THE AREAS BUT HOW COULD WE

01:25:19.547 --> 01:25:21.349
ASSURE HIGH QUALITY PROGRAMS.

01:25:21.416 --> 01:25:23.251
SO WE TOOK A LOOK AT A MODEL --

01:25:23.318 --> 01:25:25.086
USED BY SPECIALIZED SECONDARY

01:25:25.153 --> 01:25:26.855
PROGRAMS OF CREATING A REGIONAL

01:25:26.921 --> 01:25:28.990
TECHNICAL SUPPORT MODELS AND SO

01:25:29.057 --> 01:25:30.492
WE HAVE A LEVEL OF THOSE AROUND

01:25:30.558 --> 01:25:31.993
THE STATE ONE IN EACH

01:25:32.060 --> 01:25:33.595
SUPERINTENDENTS REGION.

01:25:33.661 --> 01:25:34.963
AND THESE ARE SCHOOLS THAT ARE

01:25:35.029 --> 01:25:36.498
HIGH QUALITY CAREER TECH ED

01:25:36.564 --> 01:25:38.132
PROGRAMS IN ARTS MEDIA AND

01:25:38.199 --> 01:25:39.334
ENTERTAINMENT.

01:25:39.400 --> 01:25:41.936
AND THEY ARE REQUIRED TO SHARE

01:25:42.003 --> 01:25:45.240
THEIR THEIR CURRICULUM THEIR

01:25:45.306 --> 01:25:46.374
ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE.

01:25:46.441 --> 01:25:48.543
WITH OTHER SCHOOLS IN THE REGION

01:25:48.610 --> 01:25:51.179
SO THEY PROVIDE REGIONAL SUPPORT

01:25:51.246 --> 01:25:53.648
FOR A A ME PROGRAMS AROUND THE

01:25:53.715 --> 01:25:54.516
STATE.

01:25:54.582 --> 01:25:59.254
THIS PAST YEAR WE LAUNCHED.

01:25:59.320 --> 01:26:01.289
FOR PILOT -- PRE APPRENTICESHIP

01:26:01.356 --> 01:26:04.425
PROGRAMS IN ARTS ME IN FILM AND

01:26:04.492 --> 01:26:05.026
TELEVISION PRODUCTION.

01:26:05.093 --> 01:26:06.294
THIS WAS SORT OF GREW OUT OF OUR

01:26:06.361 --> 01:26:08.129
PARTNERSHIP WITH THE CALIFORNIA

01:26:08.196 --> 01:26:09.197
FILM COMMISSION AND THE

01:26:09.264 --> 01:26:11.132
LEGISLATION THAT YOU GUYS HAVE

01:26:11.199 --> 01:26:13.167
TALKED ABOUT ABOUT BRINGING --

01:26:13.234 --> 01:26:14.502
FILM AND TELEVISION PRODUCTION

01:26:14.569 --> 01:26:17.005
BACK INTO THE STATE AND ONE OF

01:26:17.071 --> 01:26:18.673
THE PROVISIONS OF THAT IS.

01:26:18.740 --> 01:26:21.309
IS THOSE -- PRODUCTION COMPANIES

01:26:21.376 --> 01:26:23.278
NEED TO BE PART OF A CAREER

01:26:23.344 --> 01:26:24.646
READY IN THIS PROGRAM.

01:26:24.712 --> 01:26:26.381
AND SO AS PART OF THE CAREER

01:26:26.447 --> 01:26:28.116
READING THIS PROGRAM WE PARTNER

01:26:28.182 --> 01:26:30.552
WITH THE FILM COMMISSION ON

01:26:30.618 --> 01:26:32.353
IDENTIFYING HOW CAN THOSE

01:26:32.420 --> 01:26:34.355
PRODUCTION PROGRAMS ACTUALLY

01:26:34.422 --> 01:26:36.991
ENGAGE WITH EDUCATIONAL ENTITIES.

01:26:37.058 --> 01:26:38.893
BECAUSE FOR A LOT OF THE FOLKS

01:26:38.960 --> 01:26:40.328
IN IN FILM AND TELEVISION

01:26:40.395 --> 01:26:42.196
PRODUCTION THEY DON'T TALK TO

01:26:42.263 --> 01:26:43.798
EDUCATORS AND THE FOLKS WHO WERE

01:26:43.865 --> 01:26:45.333
IN EDUCATION VERY OFTEN.

01:26:45.400 --> 01:26:47.335
DON'T HAVE REGULAR CONVERSATIONS

01:26:47.402 --> 01:26:48.670
WITH THE FOLKS ARE IN FILM AND

01:26:48.736 --> 01:26:50.405
TELEVISION PRODUCTION.

01:26:50.471 --> 01:26:52.373
AND SO THAT -- CAREER READING

01:26:52.440 --> 01:26:54.108
THIS PIECE IS A WAY TO GET THAT

01:26:54.175 --> 01:26:55.977
CONVERSATION STARTED SO THAT WE

01:26:56.044 --> 01:26:57.612
CAN BE SURE THAT THE STUDENTS

01:26:57.679 --> 01:27:00.448
THAT WE GRADUATE ARE READY FOR

01:27:00.515 --> 01:27:03.451
THE CREATIVE WORK FORCE -- SO

01:27:03.518 --> 01:27:04.919
WHAT ARE FUTURE KEYS TO GROWTH

01:27:04.986 --> 01:27:06.654
IN ARTS MEDIAN ENTERTAINMENT HOW

01:27:06.721 --> 01:27:08.923
CAN WE GROW CONTINUE TO GROW

01:27:08.990 --> 01:27:11.025
THESE PROGRAMS AND BILL THIS

01:27:11.092 --> 01:27:13.094
PIPELINE AND ALSO BE SURE THAT

01:27:13.161 --> 01:27:15.129
WE HAVE HIGH QUALITY PROGRAMS IN

01:27:15.196 --> 01:27:17.599
PLACE TO PREPARE STUDENTS.

01:27:17.665 --> 01:27:19.033
THE FIRST I THINK IT'S CONTINUE.

01:27:19.100 --> 01:27:20.635
TO CONTINUATION EXPANSION OF

01:27:20.702 --> 01:27:22.270
REPORTS LIKE THE OLDEST REPORT

01:27:22.337 --> 01:27:23.638
THAT PROVIDE US WITH THE DATA WE

01:27:23.705 --> 01:27:26.074
NEED TO ACTUALLY ARGUE FOR THESE

01:27:26.140 --> 01:27:27.909
PROGRAMS TO MAKE THE CASE WITH

01:27:27.976 --> 01:27:29.777
LEGISLATORS LIKE YOURSELF.

01:27:29.844 --> 01:27:30.878
AND ALSO WITH LOCAL SCHOOL

01:27:30.945 --> 01:27:32.647
ADMINISTRATORS AND AND SITE

01:27:32.714 --> 01:27:34.582
LEVEL PRINCIPLES THAT THESE

01:27:34.649 --> 01:27:36.551
PROGRAMS ARE IMPORTANT FOR KIDS

01:27:36.618 --> 01:27:37.485
THAT THERE.

01:27:37.552 --> 01:27:39.821
ARE PLACES FOR THESE KIDS TO GO

01:27:39.887 --> 01:27:42.056
AND WORK -- THE SECOND IS

01:27:42.123 --> 01:27:43.591
INCREASE INDUSTRY AND

01:27:43.658 --> 01:27:45.360
LEGISLATIVE SUPPORT FOR CREATIVE

01:27:45.426 --> 01:27:47.395
EDUCATION ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

01:27:47.462 --> 01:27:48.997
WE DON'T DO AS WELL AS SAY

01:27:49.063 --> 01:27:50.665
AGRICULTURE EDUCATION.

01:27:50.732 --> 01:27:53.534
IS INDUSTRY ADVOCACY FOR ARTS

01:27:53.601 --> 01:27:57.972
EDUCATION -- IF A COUPLE OF I

01:27:58.039 --> 01:28:00.541
GUESS IT WAS LAST YEAR THE THE

01:28:00.608 --> 01:28:03.011
AGRICULTURE EDUCATION PROGRAM

01:28:03.077 --> 01:28:04.912
HAS SEVEN CONSULTANT SEVEN FOLKS

01:28:04.979 --> 01:28:05.980
LIKE MYSELF.

01:28:06.047 --> 01:28:07.382
AND THEY WERE FACED WITH

01:28:07.448 --> 01:28:09.617
ELIMINATING ONE OF THOSE SEVEN

01:28:09.684 --> 01:28:11.052
CONSULTANT POSITIONS.

01:28:11.119 --> 01:28:14.622
AND THE AG ADVOCACY BOARD WENT

01:28:14.689 --> 01:28:15.757
TO THE GOVERNOR.

01:28:15.823 --> 01:28:19.494
AND HE SAID WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO

01:28:19.560 --> 01:28:20.094
TO GET THESE EGG PEOPLE OFF MY

01:28:20.161 --> 01:28:20.428
BACK.

01:28:20.495 --> 01:28:22.296
AND IN FACT THEY KEPT THAT

01:28:22.363 --> 01:28:24.632
SEVENTH POSITION SO THEY HAVE

01:28:24.699 --> 01:28:26.100
SEVEN FOLKS SUPPORTING THEIR

01:28:26.167 --> 01:28:27.435
HUNDRED AND THREE THOUSAND

01:28:27.502 --> 01:28:29.070
STUDENTS WHILE WE HAVE ONE FOR

01:28:29.137 --> 01:28:30.438
OUR TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTEEN

01:28:30.505 --> 01:28:32.907
THOUSAND STUDENTS -- SHOW

01:28:32.974 --> 01:28:36.177
CONTINUED SUPPORT -- A CREATIVE

01:28:36.244 --> 01:28:38.379
EDUCATION INCENTIVE GRANT.

01:28:38.446 --> 01:28:40.581
THE ARTS AT THE AG EDUCATION HAS

01:28:40.648 --> 01:28:42.116
AN INCENTIVE GRANT A LINE ITEM

01:28:42.183 --> 01:28:43.918
IN THE BUDGET OF I THINK AROUND

01:28:43.985 --> 01:28:45.520
FOUR POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS

01:28:45.586 --> 01:28:47.355
TO SUPPORT AGRICULTURE EDUCATION

01:28:47.422 --> 01:28:49.123
OR AROUND THE STATE.

01:28:49.190 --> 01:28:51.392
BUT THERE'S NO SUCH INCENTIVE

01:28:51.459 --> 01:28:52.960
GRANT FOR CREATIVE EDUCATION.

01:28:53.027 --> 01:28:54.295
THAT WOULD SERVE STUDENTS IN

01:28:54.362 --> 01:28:57.598
GRADES K. THROUGH.

01:28:57.665 --> 01:28:58.099
TWELVE AND THAT WOULD BE

01:28:58.166 --> 01:28:59.300
VALUABLE.

01:28:59.367 --> 01:29:01.936
AND THEN START UP FUNDING FOR A

01:29:02.003 --> 01:29:03.371
ARTS MEDIAN ENTERTAINMENT

01:29:03.438 --> 01:29:05.473
TEACHER ORGANIZATION.

01:29:05.540 --> 01:29:07.108
THIS -- ARTS MEDIA AND

01:29:07.175 --> 01:29:09.444
ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY SECTOR

01:29:09.510 --> 01:29:10.945
INVOLVES TEACHERS WHO ARE

01:29:11.012 --> 01:29:12.814

01:29:12.880 --> 01:29:15.516
ARTS TEACHERS IN IN OUR TO IN

TOGETHER IN AN ORGANIZED FASHION.

01:29:21.389 --> 01:29:22.924
SO THAT THEY CAN HAVE A SINGLE

01:29:22.990 --> 01:29:26.594
VOICE IN ADVOCACY FOR PIPELINE.

01:29:26.661 --> 01:29:28.396
TO CAREERS IS AN IMPORTANT

01:29:28.463 --> 01:29:31.566
COMPONENT -- ANOTHER IMPORTANT

01:29:31.632 --> 01:29:34.769
PIECES IS THE ONE THAT.

01:29:34.836 --> 01:29:36.404
ASSEMBLY MEMBER TO MENTION AND

01:29:36.471 --> 01:29:38.206

01:29:38.272 --> 01:29:39.440
MY COLLEAGUES ARE GOING TO TALK

01:29:39.507 --> 01:29:41.142
ABOUT EDUCATIONAL DATA.

01:29:41.209 --> 01:29:43.277
BUT HAVING AN EDUCATIONAL DATA

01:29:43.344 --> 01:29:44.645
SYSTEM THAT ALLOWS US TO

01:29:44.712 --> 01:29:46.848
IDENTIFY GAPS.

01:29:46.914 --> 01:29:49.650
IN NOT ONLY SECONDARY EDUCATION

01:29:49.717 --> 01:29:51.686
BUT ALSO IN ELEMENTARY EDUCATION

01:29:51.753 --> 01:29:54.288
IS A CRITICAL PIECE OF PROVIDING

01:29:54.355 --> 01:29:56.224
ARTS EDUCATION FOR ALL

01:29:56.290 --> 01:29:57.425
CALIFORNIA STUDENTS.

01:29:57.492 --> 01:30:01.229
AND THEN -- A CONTINUED FOCUS

01:30:01.295 --> 01:30:02.630
THE LEGISLATURE HAS BEEN VERY

01:30:02.697 --> 01:30:04.599
SUPPORTIVE OF CAREER TECHNICAL

01:30:04.665 --> 01:30:06.267

GENERALLY A RESULT OF THAT

01:30:13.307 --> 01:30:15.409
SUPPORT AND SO THAT CONTINUING

01:30:15.476 --> 01:30:17.411
THAT SUPPORT IS A CRITICAL PIECE

01:30:17.478 --> 01:30:20.281
OF MAINTAINING THE PIPELINE FROM

OFFERING A PERSONAL AND

01:31:08.930 --> 01:31:11.365
HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE ON ARTS

01:31:11.432 --> 01:31:13.568
EDUCATION -- I WAS BORN AND

01:31:13.634 --> 01:31:15.369
RAISED IN STILL LIVE IN A

01:31:15.436 --> 01:31:17.572
NEIGHBORHOOD OF LA COUNTY --

01:31:17.638 --> 01:31:19.607
ELLIE CITY KNOWN AS SAN PEDRO.

01:31:19.674 --> 01:31:21.409
AND AT LAST YEAR MY DAUGHTER

01:31:21.475 --> 01:31:23.211
GRADUATED FROM THE SAME MIDDLE

01:31:23.277 --> 01:31:25.613
SCHOOL THAT I ATTENDED AND THAT

01:31:25.680 --> 01:31:29.116
MY FATHER ATTENDED -- MY FATHER

01:31:29.183 --> 01:31:30.585
GRADUATED FROM THERE IN THE

01:31:30.651 --> 01:31:32.019
NINETEEN FIFTIES.

01:31:32.086 --> 01:31:34.222
I WAS THERE -- WHEN PROP

01:31:34.288 --> 01:31:35.723
THIRTEEN PASSED AND SIGNED FRONT

01:31:35.790 --> 01:31:38.092
OF ME ONE YEAR THE ARTS IN

01:31:38.159 --> 01:31:38.826
SCHOOL AND THE NEXT YEAR THEM

01:31:38.893 --> 01:31:39.827
GONE?

01:31:39.894 --> 01:31:41.295
AND I'VE NAVIGATED MY TWO

01:31:41.362 --> 01:31:43.064
DAUGHTERS THROUGH THE EDUCATION

01:31:43.130 --> 01:31:50.872
SYSTEM ENSURING THAT THEY HAVE

01:31:50.938 --> 01:31:51.706
THE ARTS IN THEIR SCHOOLS.

01:31:51.772 --> 01:31:52.740
BECAUSE THIS BEING MY FIELD I

01:31:52.807 --> 01:31:53.841
KNOW THE IMPACT OF THE ARTS ON

01:31:53.908 --> 01:31:54.475
BRAIN DEVELOPMENT ON COGNITIVE

01:31:54.542 --> 01:31:55.042
DEVELOPMENT.

01:31:55.109 --> 01:31:55.743
ON SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT ON AN

01:31:55.810 --> 01:31:57.945
EMOTIONAL WELL BEING.

01:31:58.012 --> 01:31:59.380
SO I'M MAKING SURE THAT MY

01:31:59.447 --> 01:32:01.415
STUDENT MY CHILDREN HAVE ARTS

01:32:01.482 --> 01:32:03.050
INSTRUCTION AS PART OF THEIR

01:32:03.117 --> 01:32:04.685
PUBLIC EDUCATION.

01:32:04.752 --> 01:32:07.555
AND I DON'T BELIEVE THAT LOW --

01:32:07.622 --> 01:32:09.390
INCOME PARENTS OR IMMIGRANT

01:32:09.457 --> 01:32:12.526
PARENTS CARE LESS OR WANT LESS

01:32:12.593 --> 01:32:14.662
FOR THEIR OWN CHILDREN.

01:32:14.729 --> 01:32:17.632
BUT I AND I BELIEVE THAT A WELL

01:32:17.698 --> 01:32:19.066
ROUNDED EDUCATION.

01:32:19.133 --> 01:32:20.735
THAT INCLUDES THE ARTS BY

01:32:20.801 --> 01:32:23.571
DEFINITION -- SHOULD NOT BE

01:32:23.638 --> 01:32:26.741
SUBJECT -- TO CHILDREN WHOSE

01:32:26.807 --> 01:32:29.210
PARENTS HAVE THE KNOWLEDGE THE

01:32:29.277 --> 01:32:31.846
TIME OR THE RESOURCES TO

01:32:31.913 --> 01:32:33.881
NAVIGATE THEM THROUGH A SYSTEM.

01:32:33.948 --> 01:32:35.416
I'M OR JUST.

01:32:35.483 --> 01:32:36.918
TO HAVE THE LUCK OF LANDING IN A

01:32:36.984 --> 01:32:39.053
SCHOOL WHERE MAYBE A PRINCIPLE

01:32:39.120 --> 01:32:41.555
OR SPECIFIC TEACHER VALUES THE

01:32:41.622 --> 01:32:44.058
ARTS.

01:32:44.125 --> 01:32:45.526
OF FORTY YEARS OUT FROM

01:32:45.593 --> 01:32:47.495
PROPOSITION THIRTEEN I WILL SAY

01:32:47.561 --> 01:32:49.063
THAT I BELIEVE THAT IT'S NOT

01:32:49.130 --> 01:32:50.398
THAT THE OUT THE ARTS ARE NOT

01:32:50.464 --> 01:32:53.167
VALUED AND PUBLIC EDUCATION.

01:32:53.234 --> 01:32:55.937
I AM AND NOW IN A PLACE WHERE

01:32:56.003 --> 01:32:56.437
I'M.

01:32:56.504 --> 01:32:58.339
THINKING THAT AFTER THE FORTY

01:32:58.406 --> 01:32:59.573
YEARS WE'VE LOST THE

01:32:59.640 --> 01:33:01.776
INSTITUTIONAL MEMORY FOR HOW TO

01:33:01.842 --> 01:33:03.077
PUT THE ARTS BACK INTO PUBLIC

01:33:03.144 --> 01:33:04.178
EDUCATION.

01:33:04.245 --> 01:33:06.414
AND MAYBE ALONG THE WAY WE'VE

01:33:06.480 --> 01:33:10.351
LOST SOME PUBLIC WELL.

01:33:10.418 --> 01:33:11.319
I'M THE DIRECTOR OF ARTS

01:33:11.385 --> 01:33:12.987
EDUCATION AT THE LA COUNTY ARTS

01:33:13.054 --> 01:33:14.622
COMMISSION WHERE I OVERSEE

01:33:14.689 --> 01:33:16.357
SOMETHING CALLED THE LA COUNTY

01:33:16.424 --> 01:33:18.025
ARTS EDUCATION COLLECTIVE.

01:33:18.092 --> 01:33:20.261
IT WAS SOMETHING STARTED IN TWO

01:33:20.328 --> 01:33:20.728
THOUSAND TWO BY COUNTY

01:33:20.795 --> 01:33:22.697
GOVERNMENT BECAUSE THE COUNTY

01:33:22.763 --> 01:33:24.498
BOARD OF SUPERVISORS RECOGNIZE

01:33:24.565 --> 01:33:26.267
THE IMPORTANCE OF ARTS EDUCATION

01:33:26.334 --> 01:33:28.035
FOR CHILD DEVELOPMENT. FOR

01:33:28.102 --> 01:33:30.438
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND FOR

01:33:30.504 --> 01:33:31.939
COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT.

01:33:32.006 --> 01:33:34.809
AND SO BECAUSE LA COUNTY

01:33:34.875 --> 01:33:37.812
EDUCATES 25% OF CALIFORNIA'S

01:33:37.878 --> 01:33:40.681
PUBLIC EDUCATION STUDENTS.

01:33:40.748 --> 01:33:42.817
THE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS

01:33:42.883 --> 01:33:44.385
WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE

01:33:44.452 --> 01:33:46.921
WAS WORK BEING DONE TO SUPPORT

01:33:46.988 --> 01:33:48.789
THE EIGHTY ONE SCHOOL DISTRICTS

01:33:48.856 --> 01:33:50.391
THAT ARE EDUCATING OUR YOUNG

01:33:50.458 --> 01:33:52.226
PEOPLE.

01:33:52.293 --> 01:33:56.364
WE STARTED THIS EFFORT IN TWO

01:33:56.430 --> 01:33:56.964
THOUSAND THREE IN FIVE SCHOOL

01:33:57.031 --> 01:34:00.401
DISTRICTS AND TODAY SEVENTY OF

01:34:00.468 --> 01:34:01.635
THAT EIGHTY ONE SCHOOL DISTRICTS

01:34:01.702 --> 01:34:02.703
IN LA COUNTY.

01:34:02.770 --> 01:34:04.605
PLUS FIVE CHARTER SCHOOL

01:34:04.672 --> 01:34:06.240
NETWORKS HAVE.

01:34:06.307 --> 01:34:08.175
DEVELOPED AND ADOPTED OR IN THE

01:34:08.242 --> 01:34:09.877
PROCESS OF DEVELOPING.

01:34:09.944 --> 01:34:12.013
A STRATEGIC PLAN FOR PUTTING THE

01:34:12.079 --> 01:34:14.048
ARTS BACK INTO THEIR SCHOOLS.

01:34:14.115 --> 01:34:15.783
WE NEVER IMAGINED THAT IT THAT

01:34:15.850 --> 01:34:18.019
WOULD WE WOULD GET TO THAT LEVEL

01:34:18.085 --> 01:34:19.653
OF SCALE IN.

01:34:19.720 --> 01:34:20.388
TWO THOUSAND THREE BUT WE'RE ON

01:34:20.454 --> 01:34:21.989
PACE TO BE WORKING WITH ALL

01:34:22.056 --> 01:34:25.192
EIGHTY ONE SCHOOL DISTRICTS BY.

01:34:25.259 --> 01:34:25.826
TWENTY TWENTY WHICH GIVES US A

01:34:25.893 --> 01:34:28.362
MOMENT OF UP TO A MOMENT.

01:34:28.429 --> 01:34:29.130
TO CHECK OFF THAT FIRST

01:34:29.196 --> 01:34:33.501
BENCHMARK AND TO RE.

01:34:33.567 --> 01:34:36.170
REDEFINE WHAT WE MEAN BY SCALE

01:34:36.237 --> 01:34:38.439
AND I WOULD ARGUE BY EQUITY.

01:34:38.506 --> 01:34:40.074
M. P TO THIS POINT.

01:34:40.141 --> 01:34:40.808
I DON'T KNOW THAT THERE IS A

01:34:40.875 --> 01:34:42.843
BELIEF THAT WE NEVER REALLY GET

01:34:42.910 --> 01:34:44.111
TO SCALE AGAIN.

01:34:44.178 --> 01:34:46.047
AND SO SCALE WAS WELL MAYBE SOME

01:34:46.113 --> 01:34:47.448
DAY.

01:34:47.515 --> 01:34:49.583
EVERY CHILD EVERY SCHOOL

01:34:49.650 --> 01:34:51.585
DISTRICT WILL BE WORKING TOWARDS

01:34:51.652 --> 01:34:52.153
PUTTING ARTS BACK IN THEIR

01:34:52.219 --> 01:34:53.587
SCHOOLS.

01:34:53.654 --> 01:34:54.588
AND WHILE WE'RE DOING THAT IN

01:34:54.655 --> 01:34:55.923
TERMS OF ACTUALLY LET'S MAKE

01:34:55.990 --> 01:34:58.092
SURE THAT THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO

01:34:58.159 --> 01:34:58.993
HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN UNDER

01:34:59.060 --> 01:35:00.761
RESOURCE LET'S MAKE SURE THAT

01:35:00.828 --> 01:35:02.530
THEY REALLY ARE GETTING IT.

01:35:02.596 --> 01:35:03.998
WELL IF WE CHANGE OUR DEFINITION

01:35:04.065 --> 01:35:07.701
TO SCALE. TO EVERY CHILD ALL

01:35:07.768 --> 01:35:09.470
YEAR EVERY YEAR.

01:35:09.537 --> 01:35:10.471
THE NET ALSO SHIFTS OUR

01:35:10.538 --> 01:35:13.140
DEFINITION OF EQUITY WHICH IS TO

01:35:13.207 --> 01:35:15.142
AND THOSE FROM HISTORICALLY

01:35:15.209 --> 01:35:16.477
UNDER RESOURCE COMMUNITIES GET

01:35:16.544 --> 01:35:18.312
MORE.

01:35:18.379 --> 01:35:21.148
SO SCALE BECOMES ALL CHILDREN.

01:35:21.215 --> 01:35:22.583
AND EQUITY BECOMES AND

01:35:22.650 --> 01:35:25.019
ADDITIONAL RESOURCES FOR THOSE

01:35:25.086 --> 01:35:25.519
WHO HISTORICALLY HAVEN'T

01:35:25.586 --> 01:35:28.489
RECEIVED THEM.

01:35:28.556 --> 01:35:31.459
IN JUST ABOUT A YEAR AGO THAT LA

01:35:31.525 --> 01:35:33.561
COUNTY ARTS COMMISSION RELEASED

01:35:33.627 --> 01:35:35.629
OF WHAT IT'S CALLED AT THE ARTS

01:35:35.696 --> 01:35:37.198
EDUCATION PROFILE.

01:35:37.264 --> 01:35:39.233
OF WHICH WAS A COUNTY WIDE

01:35:39.300 --> 01:35:40.334
SNAPSHOT OF THE STATE OF ARTS

01:35:40.401 --> 01:35:42.403
EDUCATION IN ALL EIGHTY ONE

01:35:42.470 --> 01:35:44.505
SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND I WOULD PUT

01:35:44.572 --> 01:35:45.206
FORWARD THAT.

01:35:45.272 --> 01:35:48.342
IT'S OF POTENTIALLY A MODEL FOR

01:35:48.409 --> 01:35:50.277
HOW.

01:35:50.344 --> 01:35:52.346
TO USE DATA COLLECTION OR HAVE

01:35:52.413 --> 01:35:54.415
TO SHOW THE IMPACT AND VALUE OF

01:35:54.482 --> 01:35:56.851
THE ARTS AND DATA COLLECTION

01:35:56.917 --> 01:35:59.520
STATEWIDE -- IN PUTTING TOGETHER

01:35:59.587 --> 01:36:02.156
THIS REPORT WE BUILT ON THE DATA

01:36:02.223 --> 01:36:03.190
ALREADY COLLECTED BY THE

01:36:03.257 --> 01:36:04.692
CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF

01:36:04.758 --> 01:36:07.161
EDUCATION WHICH TRACKS HIGH

01:36:07.228 --> 01:36:08.529
SCHOOL COURSE WORK.

01:36:08.596 --> 01:36:10.865
BUT WE ALSO ADDED ELEMENTARY

01:36:10.931 --> 01:36:14.001
DATA WE LOOKED AT BOTH DISCRETE

01:36:14.068 --> 01:36:16.237
ARTS INSTRUCTION SO ARTS COURSES.

01:36:16.303 --> 01:36:19.073
AND INTEGRATED ARTS INSTRUCTION

01:36:19.140 --> 01:36:20.541
AND WE LOOKED AT THE ROLE OF

01:36:20.608 --> 01:36:23.244
COMMUNITY ARTS PARTNERS IN THE

01:36:23.310 --> 01:36:24.612
PROVIDING ARTS INSTRUCTION IN

01:36:24.678 --> 01:36:25.746
SCHOOLS.

01:36:25.813 --> 01:36:26.981
AND WE DID THIS FOR THREE

01:36:27.047 --> 01:36:29.216
REASONS ONE IS WE WANTED TO

01:36:29.283 --> 01:36:30.851
COLLECT MEANINGFUL DATA THAT

01:36:30.918 --> 01:36:32.453
THEN WE CAN GET BACK TO SCHOOLS

01:36:32.520 --> 01:36:33.721
AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN

01:36:33.787 --> 01:36:35.789
DEVELOPING THEIR OWN PLANS FOR

01:36:35.856 --> 01:36:37.291
ADVANCING THE ARTS SO THAT THEY

01:36:37.358 --> 01:36:38.425
WERE LOOKING UP WHAT WAS REALLY

01:36:38.492 --> 01:36:39.393
IN PLACE.

01:36:39.460 --> 01:36:41.729
AND IDENTIFYING STRATEGIES FOR

01:36:41.795 --> 01:36:43.731
AYE AT FILLING GAPS.

01:36:43.797 --> 01:36:45.432
WE ALSO WANTED THE DATA TO BE

01:36:45.499 --> 01:36:47.468
PUBLICLY OF AVAILABLE WE WANTED

01:36:47.535 --> 01:36:50.004
PERRANCE IN ONE PART OF TOWN TO

01:36:50.070 --> 01:36:51.572
BE ABLE TO SEE WHAT'S BEING

01:36:51.639 --> 01:36:52.773
OFFERED IN THEIR CHILD'S SCHOOL

01:36:52.840 --> 01:36:54.341
AND TO BE ABLE TO COMPARE THAT

01:36:54.408 --> 01:36:55.442
WITH WILL WHAT'S.

01:36:55.509 --> 01:36:57.144
WHAT OUR CHILDREN ACROSS TOWN

01:36:57.211 --> 01:36:58.879
PERHAPS IN A BETTER SOCIAL

01:36:58.946 --> 01:37:00.047
ECONOMIC NEIGHBORHOOD?

01:37:00.114 --> 01:37:01.515
WHAT ARE THEIR CHILDREN

01:37:01.582 --> 01:37:02.049
RECEIVING IN TERMS OF ARTS

01:37:02.116 --> 01:37:02.883
INSTRUCTION?

01:37:02.950 --> 01:37:04.485
AND THEN FINALLY WE WANTED TO

01:37:04.552 --> 01:37:07.154
IDENTIFY FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH

01:37:07.221 --> 01:37:08.689
THE QUANTITY.

01:37:08.756 --> 01:37:10.558
THE QUALITY AND THE EQUITY OF

01:37:10.624 --> 01:37:12.293
ARTS INSTRUCTION THAT WERE IS

01:37:12.359 --> 01:37:13.661
PROVIDED IN SCHOOLS.

01:37:13.727 --> 01:37:17.598
AND WE HAVE OVER TWENTY TWO

01:37:17.665 --> 01:37:18.666
HUNDRED SCHOOLS IN LA COUNTY.

01:37:18.732 --> 01:37:21.902
I'M WE RECEIVED A DATA BACK FROM --

01:37:21.969 --> 01:37:23.604
MORE THE FROM JUST UNDER A

01:37:23.671 --> 01:37:25.539
THOUSAND SCHOOLS AND BECAUSE

01:37:25.606 --> 01:37:31.412
THIS DATA REPRESENTS FORTY SEVEN

01:37:31.478 --> 01:37:32.846
PER ONE OF THE SCHOOLS IN OUR

01:37:32.913 --> 01:37:33.347
COUNTY WE WERE ABLE TO

01:37:33.414 --> 01:37:34.148
GENERALIZE THESE FINDINGS ACROSS

01:37:34.215 --> 01:37:35.482
ALL DISTRICTS.

01:37:35.549 --> 01:37:38.252
SO WHAT WE FOUND WAS THAT NEARLY

01:37:38.319 --> 01:37:39.386
90%.

01:37:39.453 --> 01:37:41.589
OF SCHOOLS ACROSS THE COUNTY

01:37:41.655 --> 01:37:43.791
OFFER ARTS INSTRUCTION TO THEIR

01:37:43.857 --> 01:37:45.326
STUDENTS.

01:37:45.392 --> 01:37:46.193
I HAVE THEM DOUBLE CHECK THIS

01:37:46.260 --> 01:37:48.395
DATA THREE OR FOUR TIMES BECAUSE

01:37:48.462 --> 01:37:50.864
WITH THE CONSTANT BUT THE

01:37:50.931 --> 01:37:52.233
CONSTANT WAY WE TALK ABOUT THE

01:37:52.299 --> 01:37:53.167
ARTS OR THE ARTS ARE FIRST TO BE

01:37:53.234 --> 01:37:55.236
CUT I WAS SHOCKED THAT IT WAS

01:37:55.302 --> 01:37:55.903
THAT.

01:37:55.970 --> 01:37:57.037
MANY SCHOOLS PROVIDING ARTS

01:37:57.104 --> 01:37:58.305
INSTRUCTION.

01:37:58.372 --> 01:37:59.607
SO I THINK WE NEED TO KNOW THAT

01:37:59.673 --> 01:38:02.276
WE NEED TO BREAK THE MYTH THAT

01:38:02.343 --> 01:38:03.744
THERE IS NO ARTS INSTRUCTION

01:38:03.811 --> 01:38:05.179
PROVIDED IN SCHOOL.

01:38:05.246 --> 01:38:06.747
WELL THAT WAS TRUE FOLLOWING

01:38:06.814 --> 01:38:08.582
PROPOSITION THIRTEEN THAT'S NO

01:38:08.649 --> 01:38:09.950
LONGER THE CASE AND WE NEED TO

01:38:10.017 --> 01:38:11.619
WORK HARD TO CHANGE THAT

01:38:11.685 --> 01:38:13.354
NARRATIVE -- WE NEED TO

01:38:13.420 --> 01:38:14.455
RECOGNIZE THAT THE ARTS ARE

01:38:14.521 --> 01:38:16.323
BEING TAUGHT LIFT UP MODELS LIKE

01:38:16.390 --> 01:38:18.025
JACK WAS TALKING ABOUT IN TERMS

01:38:18.092 --> 01:38:21.228
OF MODEL SCHOOLS SO THAT OTHERS

01:38:21.295 --> 01:38:24.164
CAN LEARN FROM THEM -- AND TO

01:38:24.231 --> 01:38:25.366
USE THIS AS A NEW BASELINE FOR

01:38:25.432 --> 01:38:27.401
MOVING FORWARD.

01:38:27.468 --> 01:38:29.036
BUT AS WE DIG DEEPER INTO THE

01:38:29.103 --> 01:38:32.139
DATA WE RECOGNIZE THAT THAT 90%

01:38:32.206 --> 01:38:35.242
MEANS THAT. 90% OF SCHOOLS ARE

01:38:35.309 --> 01:38:37.811
OFFERING SOME ARTS INSTRUCTION

01:38:37.878 --> 01:38:40.314
TO SOME STUDENTS FOR SOME PART

01:38:40.381 --> 01:38:42.049
OF THE YEAR [inaudible]

01:38:42.116 --> 01:38:45.786
AND IT BECOMES AN INCREASINGLY

01:38:45.853 --> 01:38:47.288
MORE INTERESTING AS WE LOOK AT

01:38:47.354 --> 01:38:50.090
SCALE AND EQUITY SO WE KNOW THAT

01:38:50.157 --> 01:38:51.325
AS EXPECTED MUSIC AND VISUAL

01:38:51.392 --> 01:38:53.794
ARTS ARE MOST OFTEN TAUGHT.

01:38:53.861 --> 01:38:55.596
WE KNOW THAT LESS THAN HALF OF

01:38:55.663 --> 01:38:57.564
ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS PROVIDE ANY

01:38:57.631 --> 01:39:00.067

01:39:09.276 --> 01:39:11.145
IF WE'RE LOOKING AT JUST SCHOOLS

01:39:11.211 --> 01:39:12.479
WITH FOURTH GRADE.

01:39:12.546 --> 01:39:14.815
WE KNOW THAT ONLY 10% OF SCHOOL

01:39:14.882 --> 01:39:17.084
OF SCHOOLS WITH FOURTH GRADERS

01:39:17.151 --> 01:39:18.786

01:49:17.183 --> 01:49:19.619
FOR WHAT USED TO BE -- THE ONE

01:49:19.686 --> 01:49:21.655
OF THE MODELS IN THE NATION AS

01:49:21.721 --> 01:49:22.989
FAR AS CREATIVITY CATION.

01:49:23.056 --> 01:49:27.093
IN CALIFORNIA THESE THREE MARKS --

01:49:27.160 --> 01:49:29.129
DID SOMETHING PROBABLY AN

01:49:29.195 --> 01:49:30.463
INTENTIONALLY BETTER.

01:49:30.530 --> 01:49:31.965
CAN DISMANTLE WHAT WAS HAPPENING

01:49:32.032 --> 01:49:34.401
CALIFORNIA AND ARTS EDUCATION.

01:49:34.467 --> 01:49:35.468
AREA [inaudible]

01:49:35.535 --> 01:49:38.872
AND THE TODAY -- WE'RE TRYING TO

01:49:38.939 --> 01:49:40.140
GET BACK TO WHERE WE WERE BEFORE

01:49:40.206 --> 01:49:41.908
BEFORE THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES

01:49:41.975 --> 01:49:44.744
WHEN WE HAD THAT -- THAT -- YOU

01:49:44.811 --> 01:49:46.947
KNOW THE MARK TO BE THE CREATIVE

01:49:47.013 --> 01:49:50.483
STATE IN THE NATION [inaudible]

01:49:50.550 --> 01:49:52.519
SO.

01:49:52.585 --> 01:49:54.821
WHEN WHEN THOSE THREES -- THREE

01:49:54.888 --> 01:49:56.356
THREE LEGISLATION TO PLACE IN

01:49:56.423 --> 01:49:57.757
THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES.

01:49:57.824 --> 01:49:59.526
SOME ORGANIZATIONS CONTINUE

01:49:59.592 --> 01:50:01.528
ADVOCATING FOR ARTS BECAUSE THEY

01:50:01.594 --> 01:50:02.696
STRONGLY BELIEVE IN THE ARTS AT

01:50:02.762 --> 01:50:03.930
THE TIME AND PTA MANY OTHER

01:50:03.997 --> 01:50:05.899
NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS CONTINUE

01:50:05.966 --> 01:50:06.833
TRYING.

01:50:06.900 --> 01:50:08.668
TO TRY TO PROVIDE STUDENTS WITH

01:50:08.735 --> 01:50:10.103
SOMETHING RELATED TO THE ARTS SO

01:50:10.170 --> 01:50:12.572
THAT THE WASN'T.

01:50:12.639 --> 01:50:14.407
TOTALLY -- TOTALLY GONE FROM

01:50:14.474 --> 01:50:16.209
SCHOOLS.

01:50:16.276 --> 01:50:17.177
BUT WHAT HAPPENED -- WITH THOSE

01:50:17.243 --> 01:50:20.013
ORGANIZATIONS AND THE WITH THE

01:50:20.080 --> 01:50:21.581
WITH THE NOT THEY'RE NOT

01:50:21.648 --> 01:50:22.882
RESOURCES AND ON MANY DIFFERENT

01:50:22.949 --> 01:50:24.184
FACTORS.

01:50:24.250 --> 01:50:25.752
WHAT HAPPENED WAS AT THE TIME

01:50:25.819 --> 01:50:28.088
THE EQUITIES IN THE DIVIDE

01:50:28.154 --> 01:50:29.823
BETWEEN STUDENTS AND AFFLUENT

01:50:29.889 --> 01:50:30.924
AREAS AND ON THERE ARE DESERVE

01:50:30.991 --> 01:50:32.525
POPULATIONS WAS CREATED?

01:50:32.592 --> 01:50:34.260
SO FROM THAT POINT FORWARD WE

01:50:34.327 --> 01:50:35.295
HEARD ABOUT.

01:50:35.362 --> 01:50:36.763
THE INEQUITIES THAT EXIST IN

01:50:36.830 --> 01:50:39.099
SCHOOLS SOME STUDENTS GET MORE

01:50:39.165 --> 01:50:40.300
SOME STUDENTS GET LESS SOME

01:50:40.367 --> 01:50:41.534
STUDENTS DON'T GET ANY AT ALL.

01:50:41.601 --> 01:50:43.503
SO THAT WAS CREATED BECAUSE OF

01:50:43.570 --> 01:50:45.105
THOSE PIECES OF LEGISLATION SO

01:50:45.171 --> 01:50:48.208
AGAIN WE'RE TRYING TO GET BACK

01:50:48.274 --> 01:50:49.909
TO WHERE WE WERE BEFORE --

01:50:49.976 --> 01:50:52.178
SENATOR ALLEN EARLIER YOU SAID

01:50:52.245 --> 01:50:53.980
AND IT'S BASED ON THE AUDITOR'S

01:50:54.047 --> 01:50:54.814
REPORT THAT.

01:50:54.881 --> 01:50:56.282
THE CREATIVITY IN THIS CREATIVE

01:50:56.349 --> 01:50:58.218
ECONOMY ONLY ONE OF TEN JOBS IN

01:50:58.284 --> 01:50:59.919
CALIFORNIA ARE.

01:50:59.986 --> 01:51:02.555
IN THAT PARTICULAR AREA.

01:51:02.622 --> 01:51:04.257
AND SO HE WILL GIVE OUR STUDENTS

01:51:04.324 --> 01:51:06.359
AN AXIS FULL ACCESS TO OUR TO

01:51:06.426 --> 01:51:08.028
THE CATION ALL THE WAY FROM THE

01:51:08.094 --> 01:51:10.397
KATE KATE -- GREAT TO THE

01:51:10.463 --> 01:51:11.498
TWELFTH GRADE.

01:51:11.564 --> 01:51:12.732
WE DON'T GIVE THEM ACCESS THEN

01:51:12.799 --> 01:51:13.700
WE'RE CONTINUING LOSING THOSE

01:51:13.767 --> 01:51:16.669
JOBS IN THE CREATIVE INDUSTRY.

01:51:16.736 --> 01:51:18.171
SO IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE

01:51:18.238 --> 01:51:19.572
CONTINUE WORKING ON THAT THE WE

01:51:19.639 --> 01:51:24.377
WE CONTINUE SAID IN THE BASE A

01:51:24.444 --> 01:51:25.011
SEVEN THERE'S STRONG PILLARS AND

01:51:25.078 --> 01:51:25.345
THE CREATIVE.

01:51:25.412 --> 01:51:25.945
INDUSTRY SO THAT WE HAVE MORE

01:51:26.012 --> 01:51:26.546
JOBS [inaudible]

01:51:26.613 --> 01:51:29.182
THAT.

01:51:29.249 --> 01:51:29.949
SO.

01:51:30.016 --> 01:51:31.851
CRITICAL FORTY IS A COALITION OF

01:51:31.918 --> 01:51:33.553
DEDICATED INNOVATIVE LEADERS WHO

01:51:33.620 --> 01:51:35.488
UNDERSTAND THAT TOGETHER WE HAVE

01:51:35.555 --> 01:51:36.956
THE POWER TO CREATE LASTING

01:51:37.023 --> 01:51:39.125
CHANGE FOR EVERY CALIFORNIA

01:51:39.192 --> 01:51:40.827
STUDENT.

01:51:40.894 --> 01:51:42.429
AND OUR MISSION IS TO ENSURE ALL

01:51:42.495 --> 01:51:43.696
STUDENTS ARE ABLE TO REACH THEIR

01:51:43.763 --> 01:51:47.333
FULL POTENTIAL -- BY EVENTS IN

01:51:47.400 --> 01:51:49.135
AN INDICATION MODEL THAT

01:51:49.202 --> 01:51:51.271
PROMOTES CREATIVITY IN THE ARTS.

01:51:51.337 --> 01:51:53.173
SO I TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN FORMER

01:51:53.239 --> 01:51:54.507
SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC

01:51:54.574 --> 01:51:56.242

OF A LOT OF RECOMMENDATIONS.

01:52:15.795 --> 01:52:18.998
SO -- WHAT HAPPENED AT THE TIME

01:52:19.065 --> 01:52:20.366
THAT THEY WENT CREEK CALIFORNIA

01:52:20.433 --> 01:52:22.335

EDUCATION AS YOU CAN SEE AT THE

01:52:42.989 --> 01:52:43.123
TOP.

01:52:43.189 --> 01:52:43.590
THE CALIFORNIA COUNTY

AND INDIVIDUALLY AND

01:52:59.405 --> 01:53:00.573
COLLECTIVELY ENOUGH TO CREATE

01:53:00.640 --> 01:53:02.742
CALIFORNIA WE'RE TRYING TO WORK --

01:53:02.809 --> 01:53:04.777
SO THAT WE MAXIMIZE THE BENEFIT

01:53:04.844 --> 01:53:06.179

AREAS -- THE DATE THAT THEY

01:53:28.501 --> 01:53:37.277
CONTINUOUSLY -- PURSUIT.

01:53:37.343 --> 01:53:38.278
SAW THREE TELEPHONE IN THE

01:53:38.344 --> 01:53:41.514
POLICY COUNCIL IS -- TRYING --

SINCE THEY SUPERINTENDENT BY THE

01:53:52.859 --> 01:53:54.127
CONSTRUCTION AS THE COALITION.

01:53:54.194 --> 01:53:56.062
TO PRODUCE A BLUEPRINT FOR

01:53:56.129 --> 01:53:57.797
CREATIVE SCHOOLS.

01:53:57.864 --> 01:53:59.966
WHICH WOULD THE FOCUS AND SEVEN

01:54:00.033 --> 01:54:02.535
AREAS. SEVEN AREAS AND WHICH

01:54:02.602 --> 01:54:03.870
INCLUDED OVER SEVENTY

01:54:03.937 --> 01:54:05.905

01:54:06.573 --> 01:54:08.441
STATE.

01:54:08.508 --> 01:54:10.476
THE YET THE COUNCIL -- AFTER THE

01:54:10.543 --> 01:54:11.911
LIGHTS IN THE BLUEPRINT AND AT

01:54:11.978 --> 01:54:12.845
DIFFERENT DIFFERENT AREAS WERE

01:54:12.912 --> 01:54:14.480
DIFFERENT RECOMMENDATIONS.

01:54:14.547 --> 01:54:17.016
IDENTIFIED RESEARCH AND DATA AND

01:54:17.083 --> 01:54:18.585
EQUITY AS THE TWO AREAS THAT

01:54:18.651 --> 01:54:21.387
NEEDED TO BE FOCUS ON FIRST.

01:54:21.454 --> 01:54:23.690
SO WITH THAT -- I LIKE TO TALK

01:54:23.756 --> 01:54:26.526
ABOUT A COUPLE OF A COUPLE OF

01:54:26.593 --> 01:54:27.193
AREAS THAT WE HAVE BEEN WORKING

01:54:27.260 --> 01:54:30.330
ON AND ONE OF THM IS -- RELATED

01:54:30.396 --> 01:54:32.232
TO THE DATA THE HAS BEEN TALKED

01:54:32.298 --> 01:54:32.799
ABOUT SEVERAL TIMES ALREADY

01:54:32.865 --> 01:54:34.534
TODAY.

01:54:34.601 --> 01:54:39.105
THE DATA PROJECT AND CALIFORNIA

01:54:39.172 --> 01:54:40.773
IS THE FIRST STATE TO

01:54:40.840 --> 01:54:41.908
PARTICIPATE ALLOW TO THE DATA

01:54:41.975 --> 01:54:44.477
AFTER THE NEW JERSEY PROJECT YOU

01:54:44.544 --> 01:54:45.979
JUST HAD A PROJECT WHERE.

01:54:46.045 --> 01:54:47.413
WHERE THEY WERE AND LICENSE

01:54:47.480 --> 01:54:49.148
CONTINUOUSLY THE DATA FOR ARTS

01:54:49.215 --> 01:54:50.116
EDUCATION AND STATE?

01:54:50.183 --> 01:54:52.385
SO CALIFORNIA WANTED TO DO

01:54:52.452 --> 01:54:54.687
SOMETHING SIMILAR SO THEY TOOK

01:54:54.754 --> 01:54:58.224
ON THE BIGGER SAY PILOT.

01:54:58.291 --> 01:55:00.026
AND THAT'S WHAT YOU SEE JUST AS

01:55:00.093 --> 01:55:01.194
DOES AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT IT IS

01:55:01.261 --> 01:55:02.662
AND IS THIS IS THE DATA PROJECT

01:55:02.729 --> 01:55:03.596
IS A DASHBOARD THAT THAT

01:55:03.663 --> 01:55:04.230
INCLUDES.

01:55:04.297 --> 01:55:05.798
INFORMATION.

01:55:05.865 --> 01:55:08.101
FOR ALL THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND

01:55:08.167 --> 01:55:09.636
ALL HIGH SCHOOLS MIDDLE SCHOOLS

01:55:09.702 --> 01:55:10.637
IN THE STATE.

01:55:10.703 --> 01:55:12.071
AND OF COURSE -- AT HAS BEEN

01:55:12.138 --> 01:55:13.506
MENTIONED BEFORE SEVERAL TIMES

01:55:13.573 --> 01:55:15.441
THE ELEMENTARY INFORMATION IS

01:55:15.508 --> 01:55:18.144
NOT COMPLETE YET IT'S NOT THERE.

01:55:18.211 --> 01:55:18.911
BECAUSE THE ELEMENTARY EDUCATION

01:55:18.978 --> 01:55:20.847
IS NOT A REQUIREMENT TO BE

01:55:20.913 --> 01:55:22.515
SUBMITTED BY THE SCHOOL DISTRICT.

01:55:22.582 --> 01:55:24.183
AND AND I LIKE TO ADD HERE

01:55:24.250 --> 01:55:25.852
COMMENT THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER SHE

01:55:25.918 --> 01:55:27.920
WOULD TRULY APPRECIATE YOUR WORK

01:55:27.987 --> 01:55:29.289
ON ON SUBMITTED THAT.

01:55:29.355 --> 01:55:31.524
THE BILL THAT THAT IS LOOKING

01:55:31.591 --> 01:55:32.859
FOR REQUIRE IN ELEMENTARY

01:55:32.925 --> 01:55:34.427
EDUCATION TO BE SUBMITTED.

01:55:34.494 --> 01:55:36.029
BECAUSE I THINK IT IS CRITICAL

01:55:36.095 --> 01:55:37.363
THAT WE HAVE THAT INFORMATION

01:55:37.430 --> 01:55:38.665
NOT ONLY AT THE HIGH SCHOOL AND

01:55:38.731 --> 01:55:39.866
MIDDLE SCHOOL LEVEL.

01:55:39.932 --> 01:55:41.367
BUT ALSO AT THE ELEMENTARY LEVEL

01:55:41.434 --> 01:55:43.836
IF WE ARE LOOKING FOR WAYS.

01:55:43.903 --> 01:55:45.038
TO ASSIST OUR STUDENTS AND TO

01:55:45.104 --> 01:55:46.673
IMPROVE THE SYSTEM ALL THE WAY

01:55:46.739 --> 01:55:48.041
FROM THE BEGINNING WE HAVE TO

01:55:48.107 --> 01:55:49.075
HAVE THAT INFORMATION.

01:55:49.142 --> 01:55:52.412
AND I'M PLEASED TO SAY THAT THAT --

01:55:52.478 --> 01:55:54.247
IN IN THE EVEN WHEN THE

01:55:54.314 --> 01:55:56.516
INFORMATION IS NOT REQUIRE.

01:55:56.582 --> 01:55:58.184
SEVERAL DISTRICTS THE US BEEN

01:55:58.251 --> 01:56:03.556
MENTIONED SEVERAL DISTRICTS TO

01:56:03.623 --> 01:56:05.325
MEET THE INFORMATION ANYWAY BUT

01:56:05.391 --> 01:56:07.160
IT'S ONLY ABOUT 70% OF DISTRICTS

01:56:07.226 --> 01:56:08.227
STATEWIDE WE HAVE OVER ONE

01:56:08.294 --> 01:56:09.262
THOUSAND SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND

01:56:09.329 --> 01:56:10.863
PROBABLY ABOUT A HUNDRED AND

01:56:10.930 --> 01:56:11.397
SEVENTY TWO HUNDRED SCHOOL

01:56:11.464 --> 01:56:11.964
DISTRICTS ARE SUBMITTED THE

01:56:12.031 --> 01:56:12.432
INFORMATION.

01:56:12.498 --> 01:56:13.333
SO THAT DOESN'T GIVE YOU A CLEAR

01:56:13.399 --> 01:56:13.966
PICTURE OF WHAT IS HAPPENING AT

01:56:14.033 --> 01:56:14.734
THAT LEVEL.

01:56:14.801 --> 01:56:15.668
SO AGAIN I THANK YOU FOR THAT

01:56:15.735 --> 01:56:18.171
EFFORT BECAUSE IT IS CRITICAL

01:56:18.237 --> 01:56:20.239
THAT WE HAVE THAT INFORMATION.

01:56:20.306 --> 01:56:22.342
AND THE IN THROUGH THE DASHBOARD

01:56:22.408 --> 01:56:25.244
WE HAVE LEARNED THAT ABOUT 39%

01:56:25.311 --> 01:56:26.813
OF MIDDLE AND HIGH SCHOOL

01:56:26.879 --> 01:56:27.814
STUDENTS IN OUR STATE.

01:56:27.880 --> 01:56:29.849
RECEIVE OR HAVE ACCESS TO AND

01:56:29.916 --> 01:56:32.518
PARTICIPATE IN ONE OR MORE ARTS

01:56:32.585 --> 01:56:34.854
DISCIPLINES.

01:56:34.921 --> 01:56:36.589
AND THE THIS THESE LAST WORD

01:56:36.656 --> 01:56:38.658
ALLOWS YOU TO SEE A YOU KNOW THE

01:56:38.725 --> 01:56:40.259
DIFFERENT COLOR STILL DO.

01:56:40.326 --> 01:56:41.427
YOU KNOW THE THE THE DARKER

01:56:41.494 --> 01:56:43.229
COLORS ARE MORE WHERE THEY COULD

01:56:43.296 --> 01:56:43.763
CALL LEASES ARE WITH THE

01:56:43.830 --> 01:56:44.430
CRITICAL.

01:56:44.497 --> 01:56:46.199
AREAS THAT NEED TO BE WORKED ON

01:56:46.265 --> 01:56:48.067
OUR AND THE CLEAR CALLERS ARE

01:56:48.134 --> 01:56:50.903
WHERE THERE'S SOMETHING GREAT

01:56:50.970 --> 01:56:51.938
BEING DONE.

01:56:52.004 --> 01:56:53.106
IN THE AREAS AND THEN -- THE

01:56:53.172 --> 01:56:53.740
OTHER PIECES THAT BAY

01:56:53.806 --> 01:56:56.476
INTERPRETATION OF WHAT IS

01:56:56.542 --> 01:56:57.944
EARLIER AND YOU KNOW SOME

01:56:58.010 --> 01:56:59.579
DISTRICTS ARE DOING SOMETHING AT

01:56:59.645 --> 01:57:01.347
CERTAIN TIMES AND FOR ONLY

01:57:01.414 --> 01:57:02.281
CERTAIN STUDENTS.

01:57:02.348 --> 01:57:06.786
SO THE INFORMATION THAT'S WHY

01:57:06.853 --> 01:57:08.588
IT'S CRITICAL TO HAVE IT.

01:57:08.654 --> 01:57:09.355
THAT WHEN WE COMPARE TO OTHER

01:57:09.422 --> 01:57:10.289
STATES IN THE NATION.

01:57:10.356 --> 01:57:10.923
THERE ARE TEN STATES THAT ARE

01:57:10.990 --> 01:57:13.960
USING THE DATA PROJECT -- TO

01:57:14.026 --> 01:57:15.595
ANALYZE THE DATA AND ARTS

01:57:15.661 --> 01:57:17.730
EDUCATION.

01:57:17.797 --> 01:57:18.398
I MENTIONED EARLIER THAT THE IN

01:57:18.464 --> 01:57:20.666
OUR STATE 39% OF STUDENTS HAVE

01:57:20.733 --> 01:57:22.201
THAT PARTICIPATION.

01:57:22.268 --> 01:57:23.403
IT WILL LOOK AT WISCONSIN

01:57:23.469 --> 01:57:27.306
WISCONSIN HAS 77% PARTICIPATION.

01:57:27.373 --> 01:57:30.343
IF WE LOOK AT OHIO HI IT HAS 82%

01:57:30.410 --> 01:57:32.011
PARTICIPATION.

01:57:32.078 --> 01:57:34.180
WHY IS IT THAT THE DIFFERENCE?

01:57:34.247 --> 01:57:35.381
WHEN I GO BACK TO THAT SLIDE

01:57:35.448 --> 01:57:36.516
THAT SHOW THE THREE MARKS IN

01:57:36.582 --> 01:57:38.418
HISTORY AND I BELIEVE THAT THAT

01:57:38.484 --> 01:57:40.486
THAT THAT THE DIFFERENCE WAS

01:57:40.553 --> 01:57:42.054
CREATED WITH THOSE THREE MARKS?

01:57:42.121 --> 01:57:44.190
WITH THOSE TWO PIECES OF HISTORY

01:57:44.257 --> 01:57:44.824
THE PLACE.

01:57:44.891 --> 01:57:46.726
AND DISMANTLE WHAT WAS HAPPENING

01:57:46.793 --> 01:57:49.896
IN CALIFORNIA SO NOW WE'RE AT

01:57:49.962 --> 01:57:50.830
239%.

01:57:50.897 --> 01:57:52.231
AND AGAIN MANY ORGANIZATIONS

01:57:52.298 --> 01:57:55.301
FIGHTING TO BRING IT BACK TO A

01:57:55.368 --> 01:57:56.502
MUCH HIGHER LEVEL.

01:57:56.569 --> 01:58:00.273
SO AGAIN -- THE BACK TO THE DATA

01:58:00.339 --> 01:58:02.074
CALIFORNIA IS THE ONLY STATE NOT

01:58:02.141 --> 01:58:03.843
REQUIRED REPORTING THE

01:58:03.910 --> 01:58:05.144
ELEMENTARY DATA.

01:58:05.211 --> 01:58:07.447
THE ONLY STATE IN THE NATION.

01:58:07.513 --> 01:58:08.881
WHICH I BELIEVE IS -- IT'S BEEN

01:58:08.948 --> 01:58:10.650
DETRIMENTAL TO THE SYSTEM SO

01:58:10.716 --> 01:58:11.851
AGAIN I'D LIKE TO STRESS THE

01:58:11.918 --> 01:58:13.853
IMPORTANCE OF HAVING THAT

01:58:13.920 --> 01:58:15.555
INFORMATION.

01:58:15.621 --> 01:58:17.190
AND WE HEAR FROM SOME DISTRICTS

01:58:17.256 --> 01:58:19.091
THAT ARE WILLING TO TO PROVIDE

01:58:19.158 --> 01:58:20.526
THAT INFORMATION BUT ALSO THAT

01:58:20.593 --> 01:58:23.830
SHOULD BE A REQUIREMENT.

01:58:23.896 --> 01:58:26.999
AND THE I HAVE MY NOTES HERE AB

01:58:27.066 --> 01:58:27.633
THREE NINETY EIGHT IS A BILL TO

01:58:27.700 --> 01:58:28.367
YOU.

01:58:28.434 --> 01:58:31.304
THE QUEUE -- AUTHORED AND AGAIN

01:58:31.370 --> 01:58:33.840
WE APPRECIATE THAT.

01:58:33.906 --> 01:58:36.576
AND THE SAD TO HEAR THAT IS NOT

01:58:36.642 --> 01:58:38.878
HAVING.

01:58:38.945 --> 01:58:40.046
PERFORMANCE BUT GLAD TO HEAR

01:58:40.112 --> 01:58:41.714
THAT YOU'RE WILLING TO SUBMITTED

01:58:41.781 --> 01:58:42.648
AGAIN.

01:58:42.715 --> 01:58:51.357
IN THE FUTURE OF ANOTHER CONCERN

01:58:51.424 --> 01:58:55.061
IS THE EQUITY GAP WHICH WHICH

01:58:55.127 --> 01:58:56.395
AND AND THAT THAT'S WHERE YOU

01:58:56.462 --> 01:58:57.630
CAN SEE CLEARLY.

01:58:57.697 --> 01:58:59.265
WHEN YOU GO IN AND YOU CAN SEE

01:58:59.332 --> 01:59:00.666
ANY SCHOOL DISTRICT IN THE STATE

01:59:00.733 --> 01:59:02.201
THAT ANY ANY HIGH SCHOOL AND YOU

01:59:02.268 --> 01:59:03.035
CAN SEE [inaudible]

01:59:03.102 --> 01:59:06.906
THAT -- SOME GRABS TELL YOU THAT

01:59:06.973 --> 01:59:08.641
THE STUDENTS THAT ARE RECEIVING

01:59:08.708 --> 01:59:10.843
LESS OR THAT HAVE ACCESS TO LAST

01:59:10.910 --> 01:59:12.879
YEAH ARTS EDUCATION ARE DOES

01:59:12.945 --> 01:59:15.081
THAT ARE ON THE DAY.

01:59:15.147 --> 01:59:17.116
THE FREE LUNCH PROGRAM.

01:59:17.183 --> 01:59:17.884
THAT MEANS THAT THE STUDENTS ARE

01:59:17.950 --> 01:59:19.652
THE LOW INCOME AREAS ARE THE

01:59:19.719 --> 01:59:20.586
ONES THAT ARE NOT HAVING.

01:59:20.653 --> 01:59:23.089
ENOUGH AXIS.

01:59:23.155 --> 01:59:24.390
YEAH SO SO THAT'S AN EQUITY

01:59:24.457 --> 01:59:25.258
ISSUE THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO

01:59:25.324 --> 01:59:26.659
CONTINUE CONTINUE FIGHTING

01:59:26.726 --> 01:59:28.861
BECAUSE IT IS NOT FAIR FOR THE

01:59:28.928 --> 01:59:30.062
STUDENTS THAT ARE IN THE LOW

01:59:30.129 --> 01:59:31.697
INCOME AREAS TO NOT HAVING.

01:59:31.764 --> 01:59:34.567
THAT OPPORTUNITY. TO TO NOT HAVE

01:59:34.634 --> 01:59:37.870
THAT ACCESS AND TO EXPLORE THEIR

01:59:37.937 --> 01:59:40.206
TALENTS AND SKILLS AND THE CREE

01:59:40.273 --> 01:59:41.541
TV.

01:59:41.607 --> 01:59:43.075
THEY THEY SHOULD HAVE THE SAME

01:59:43.142 --> 01:59:45.645
OPPORTUNITY OF OTHERS.

01:59:45.711 --> 01:59:47.113
TO ANOTHER PLEASE THAT I'D LIKE

01:59:47.179 --> 01:59:48.414
TO MENTION TO YOU IS A THE

01:59:48.481 --> 01:59:50.249
DECLARATION OF STUDENT RIGHTS TO

01:59:50.316 --> 01:59:52.151
EQUITY IN OUR LEARNING.

01:59:52.218 --> 01:59:54.186
CREATE CALIFORNIA PRODUCED A

01:59:54.253 --> 01:59:56.088
DECLARATION OF STUDENTS RIGHTS.

01:59:56.155 --> 01:59:59.125
WHICH IS A A DOCUMENT THAT

01:59:59.191 --> 02:00:01.794
EXPLAINS IN SIX SIX ITEMS WHAT

02:00:01.861 --> 02:00:03.362
THE STUDENTS HAVE THE RIGHT TO

02:00:03.429 --> 02:00:04.463

WEBSITE AND CREATE CALIFORNIA

02:00:29.422 --> 02:00:30.990
WEBSITE WHERE YOU CAN SEE WHAT

02:00:31.057 --> 02:00:33.125
DISTRICTS HAVE ALREADY ADOPTED

02:00:33.192 --> 02:00:34.961
AND WHAT ORGANIZATIONS HAVE IT

02:00:35.027 --> 02:00:36.796
READY ABOUT ADOPTED THESE.

02:00:36.862 --> 02:00:38.764
RESOLUTION AND I I HAVE CONCERT

02:00:38.831 --> 02:00:39.599
HERE I'M PROUD TO SAY THAT MARIN

02:00:39.665 --> 02:00:41.233
THE VALUE WAS THE FIRST SCHOOL

02:00:41.300 --> 02:00:42.969
DISTRICT IN THE STATE THAT ABOUT

02:00:43.035 --> 02:00:43.302
THAT.

02:00:43.369 --> 02:00:44.737
SUCH RESOLUTION.

02:00:44.804 --> 02:00:45.471
AND IT IS A COMMITMENT THAT WE

02:00:45.538 --> 02:00:48.074
MADE TO PROVIDE ACCESS TO ALL OF

02:00:48.140 --> 02:00:49.642
OUR STUDENTS IN THE DIFFERENT

02:00:49.709 --> 02:00:50.977
AREAS AND WE'RE WORKING.

02:00:51.043 --> 02:00:52.778
VERY HARD TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN IN

02:00:52.845 --> 02:00:54.246
OUR DISTRICT BUT AT THE SAME

02:00:54.313 --> 02:00:56.482
TIME WE'RE TRYING TO CONVINCE

02:00:56.549 --> 02:00:58.050
ORDER SCHOOL DISTRICT'S OTHER

02:00:58.117 --> 02:00:59.151
SCHOOL BOARDS. TO ADOPT THE

02:00:59.218 --> 02:01:00.753
RESOLUTION AND DO THE SAME THING

02:01:00.820 --> 02:01:02.421
THAT WE'RE DOING AS WELL AS

02:01:02.488 --> 02:01:03.656
OTHER ORGANIZATIONS.

02:01:03.723 --> 02:01:07.126
GAVE ACCESS TO ALL THE STUDENTS.

02:01:07.193 --> 02:01:10.796
TO ARTS EDUCATION EQUITABLE.

02:01:10.863 --> 02:01:12.865
ARTS EDUCATION.

02:01:12.932 --> 02:01:13.966
NOT EARLIER -- SEVERAL SPEAKERS

02:01:14.033 --> 02:01:15.801
TALKED ABOUT THE NEW STANDARDS.

02:01:15.868 --> 02:01:16.969
AND CREATE CALIFORNIANS PARTNERS

02:01:17.036 --> 02:01:18.037
ARE WORKING TO BUILD AWARENESS

02:01:18.104 --> 02:01:19.005
ABOUT THE NEW STANDARDS IN

02:01:19.071 --> 02:01:19.905
WORKING ON WAYS TO HELP

02:01:19.972 --> 02:01:21.273
EDUCATORS.

02:01:21.340 --> 02:01:22.775
UNDERSTAND THE NEW STANDARDS.

02:01:22.842 --> 02:01:24.310
WHICH EVERY DIFFERENT FROM OUR

02:01:24.377 --> 02:01:25.778
PREVIOUS STANDARDS.

02:01:25.845 --> 02:01:29.715
SO -- THIS WAS ALREADY MENTIONED --

02:01:29.782 --> 02:01:31.784
AND SO WE'RE VERY AWARE AND WILL

02:01:31.851 --> 02:01:35.388
CONTINUE WORKING ON THAT

02:01:35.454 --> 02:01:35.688
[inaudible]

02:01:35.755 --> 02:01:39.191
SO OF IN A STUDY CONDUCTED BY

02:01:39.258 --> 02:01:40.826
OUR A PUBLIC RELATIONS COMPANY

02:01:40.893 --> 02:01:42.795
WE REALIZE THAT SOMETIMES THE

02:01:42.862 --> 02:01:44.764
IMAGE THAT PUBLIC MY CALLED BAR

02:01:44.830 --> 02:01:46.666
TO THE KITCHEN IS THAT IT'S A

02:01:46.732 --> 02:01:48.000
NICE THING TO HAVE.

02:01:48.067 --> 02:01:48.768
YEAH THAT'S A PROBLEM THAT WE

02:01:48.834 --> 02:01:51.003
HAVE AND IN MANY MANY OF OUR

02:01:51.070 --> 02:01:52.738
SCHOOLS NOT ONLY READ ABOUT IT

02:01:52.805 --> 02:01:53.172
BUT IN OTHER AREAS.

02:01:53.239 --> 02:01:54.140
TOO AB AND THAT WHAT IS THE

02:01:54.206 --> 02:01:55.408
DEFINITION OF HAVING A GOOD

02:01:55.474 --> 02:01:57.977
QUALITY EQUITABLE EDUCATION.

02:01:58.044 --> 02:01:59.812
AND AND HAS TO BE MEANINGFUL THE

02:01:59.879 --> 02:02:01.714
HAS TO BE -- BY LINE WITH THE

02:02:01.781 --> 02:02:03.582
STANDARDS AND AND THAT.

02:02:03.649 --> 02:02:05.451
THE CREATING BAD WELL ROUNDED

02:02:05.518 --> 02:02:07.219
EDUCATION FOR STUDENTS TO START

02:02:07.286 --> 02:02:08.220
JUST HAVING A PIECE OF PAPER AND

02:02:08.287 --> 02:02:09.855
A PEN OR PENCIL.

02:02:09.922 --> 02:02:10.456
AND ALLOWING THE STUDENTS DO

02:02:10.523 --> 02:02:14.527
WHATEVER THEY WANT THAT HAS TO

02:02:14.593 --> 02:02:16.328
BE STRUCTURE.

02:02:16.395 --> 02:02:17.830
AND NOW IT'S HARD TO COMMUNICATE

02:02:17.897 --> 02:02:20.266
THAT THAT TO STUDENTS AND TO

02:02:20.332 --> 02:02:21.600
EDUCATE OR SOMETIMES AND TO THE

02:02:21.667 --> 02:02:21.867
PARENTS.

02:02:21.934 --> 02:02:23.436
BUT IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE

02:02:23.502 --> 02:02:25.671
CONTINUE TO FINDING PROPERLY

02:02:25.738 --> 02:02:28.374
WHAT ARTS EDUCATION THIS IS NOT

02:02:28.441 --> 02:02:30.910
JUST.

02:02:30.976 --> 02:02:33.245
CHILDREN AS PLAYED BY.

02:02:33.312 --> 02:02:34.780
MANY POOR ARTS EDUCATION

02:02:34.847 --> 02:02:35.081
[inaudible]

USE THAT DATA. TO GO AFTER SOME

02:05:47.239 --> 02:05:49.642
PRIVATE FUNDING PRIVATE GRANT

02:05:49.708 --> 02:05:51.677
INSIDE I WOULD THINK.

02:05:51.744 --> 02:05:55.614
WOULD WOULD -- LISTED THE TO THE

02:05:55.681 --> 02:05:57.917
DISCREPANCY THE GAP.

02:05:57.983 --> 02:06:00.119
I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF OF

02:06:00.185 --> 02:06:02.154
PRIVATE SECTOR THE BILL.

02:06:02.221 --> 02:06:04.189
ALSO WANTED TO CLOSE THE GAP FOR

02:06:04.256 --> 02:06:05.958
THE ARTS A COLLECTIVE IS A

02:06:06.025 --> 02:06:08.093
PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP SO

02:06:08.160 --> 02:06:10.062
FUNDED BY LA COUNTY GOVERNMENT.

02:06:10.129 --> 02:06:15.968
AND THE PULL OF THIRTY

02:06:16.035 --> 02:06:16.902
PHILANTHROPIC CORPORATE AND

02:06:16.969 --> 02:06:18.137
FOUNDATION PARTNERS.

02:06:18.203 --> 02:06:22.107
ON SO HAD THEY DID HELP FUND THE

02:06:22.174 --> 02:06:25.778
AT THE DATA PROJECT -- AND WHILE

02:06:25.844 --> 02:06:27.513
I BELIEVE THAT IT'S IMPORTANT

02:06:27.579 --> 02:06:28.847
THAT PHILLIP PHILANTHROPIST

02:06:28.914 --> 02:06:31.750
PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN.

02:06:31.817 --> 02:06:34.186
RISK TAKING INNOVATION TRYING

02:06:34.253 --> 02:06:35.754
NEW MODELS TESTING NEW

02:06:35.821 --> 02:06:39.692
PROTOTYPES -- IT'S REALLY THE

02:06:39.758 --> 02:06:41.827
GOVERNMENT FUNDING THAT ALLOWS

02:06:41.894 --> 02:06:44.396
SCALE AND SUSTAINABILITY.

02:06:44.463 --> 02:06:46.098
AND WOULD PUT FORWARD THAT WHEN

02:06:46.165 --> 02:06:48.467
WE THINK ABOUT MATH INSTRUCTION --

02:06:48.534 --> 02:06:49.835
WE DON'T THINK ABOUT

02:06:49.902 --> 02:06:52.171
PHILANTHROPY AND NONPROFIT ARTS

02:06:52.237 --> 02:06:53.672
OR NOT NONPROFIT COMMUNITY

02:06:53.739 --> 02:06:55.708
PARTNERS STEPPING IN TO PROVIDE

02:06:55.774 --> 02:06:57.309
THE BULK OF INSTRUCTION.

02:06:57.376 --> 02:07:00.446
AND SO -- I WOULD OFFERED THAT

02:07:00.512 --> 02:07:02.514
WE'RE AT A UNIQUE MOMENT WE HAVE

02:07:02.581 --> 02:07:05.250
A REAL OPPORTUNITY HERE WITH THE

02:07:05.317 --> 02:07:07.553
NEW STANDARDS BEING PASSED THE

02:07:07.619 --> 02:07:09.154
NEW FRAMEWORK COMING ON BOARD.

02:07:09.221 --> 02:07:12.358
I MENTIONED EARLIER THAT -- MINE

02:07:12.424 --> 02:07:13.959
WAS THE GENERATION.

02:07:14.026 --> 02:07:16.428
THAT WAS HIT BY PROPOSITION

02:07:16.495 --> 02:07:17.529
THIRTEEN WHICH MEANS THAT.

02:07:17.596 --> 02:07:19.231
ANYONE IN THIS ROOM YOUNGER THAN

02:07:19.298 --> 02:07:21.133
ME COULD HAVE GONE THE COMPLETE

02:07:21.200 --> 02:07:24.570
K. TWELVE EDUCATION WITHOUT ANY

02:07:24.636 --> 02:07:25.437
ARTS INSTRUCTION.

02:07:25.504 --> 02:07:27.339
SO IF WE REALLY ARE GOING TO

02:07:27.406 --> 02:07:29.008
LOOK AT BROAD SCALE SYSTEMS

02:07:29.074 --> 02:07:31.910
CHANGE AND REALLY GET TO ISSUES

02:07:31.977 --> 02:07:33.379
OF SCALE IN EQUITY.

02:07:33.445 --> 02:07:34.713
THEN I WOULD ENCOURAGE US TO

02:07:34.780 --> 02:07:37.583
THINK OF THE ROLL OUT OF THE

02:07:37.649 --> 02:07:39.551
FRAME WORK SIMILAR TO HOW WE

02:07:39.618 --> 02:07:40.819
THOUGHT OF COMMON CORE.

02:07:40.886 --> 02:07:42.955
THAT WAS A DRAMATIC SYSTEMS

02:07:43.022 --> 02:07:44.523
CHANGE ACT COULD A DRAMATIC

02:07:44.590 --> 02:07:46.525
SHIFT IN HOW WE THINK ABOUT

02:07:46.592 --> 02:07:48.060
EDUCATING OUR YOUNG PEOPLE.

02:07:48.127 --> 02:07:51.930
AND TO RECOGNIZE THAT.

02:07:51.997 --> 02:07:53.599
REALLY PUTTING THE ARTS BACK IN

02:07:53.665 --> 02:07:55.100
EVERY SCHOOL FOR EVERY CHILD

WE'LL TAKE THAT KIND O

02:07:56.201 --> 02:07:58.237

TEACHERS HAVE THE SKILLS AND

02:08:01.373 --> 02:08:04.276
ABILITY TO REALLY IMPLEMENT ARTS

02:08:04.343 --> 02:08:05.811

02:17:06.585 --> 02:17:08.687
TESTS OUT AT YOU KNOW THERE

02:17:08.753 --> 02:17:09.988
STATEWIDE TESTING.

02:17:10.055 --> 02:17:11.156
AT THE THIRTY FOR THIRTY

02:17:11.222 --> 02:17:12.757
PERCENTILE.

02:17:12.824 --> 02:17:15.827
I MEAN AND IT'S VERY.

02:17:15.894 --> 02:17:17.462
OUR OUR KIDS AVERAGE.

02:17:17.529 --> 02:17:19.097
THE FIFTIETH IN THE ONES IN OUR

02:17:19.164 --> 02:17:21.800
CLASSES I MEAN IT'S NOT GOING TO

02:17:21.866 --> 02:17:22.534
BE THEY'RE GOING TO BE UP TO A

02:17:22.601 --> 02:17:25.170
YEAR BUT THE REASON FOR THE

02:17:25.236 --> 02:17:26.304
OUTCOMES.

02:17:26.371 --> 02:17:28.807
AS I VAST SUPERINTENDENTS IS

02:17:28.873 --> 02:17:30.475
BECAUSE EVERY KIDS ENGAGE.

02:17:30.542 --> 02:17:32.410
NOBODY IS THERE ALL ENGAGED AND

02:17:32.477 --> 02:17:33.878
THEY ALL WANT TO BE THERE.

02:17:33.945 --> 02:17:36.214
AND SO THINGS HAPPEN ATTENDANCE

02:17:36.281 --> 02:17:38.750
GOES UP -- THEY'RE MORE

02:17:38.817 --> 02:17:40.652
INTERESTED IN SCHOOL AND ANOTHER

02:17:40.719 --> 02:17:41.920
THING HAPPENS THEIR TEAMMATES

02:17:41.987 --> 02:17:43.121
COLUMN UP TO MAKE SURE THEY GET

02:17:43.188 --> 02:17:44.556
TO SCHOOL BECAUSE THEY GOT TO

02:17:44.623 --> 02:17:45.624
GET THE PROJECT DONE.

02:17:45.690 --> 02:17:50.629
BY THE END OF MAY -- SO AND THE

02:17:50.695 --> 02:17:52.464
MOVE SOME DRAMATIC THINGS HAVE

02:17:52.530 --> 02:17:54.099
HAPPENED WITH RESPECT TO ENGLISH

02:17:54.165 --> 02:17:56.368
LANGUAGE LEARNERS -- THERE'S A

02:17:56.434 --> 02:17:58.203
THING CALLED EL TELLS AND THAT'S

02:17:58.269 --> 02:18:00.205
IN SOPHOMORES AND HOT THAT'S IN

02:18:00.271 --> 02:18:02.474
HIGH SCHOOL WERE LAKE

02:18:02.540 --> 02:18:04.442
TRANSITIONING WITH.

02:18:04.509 --> 02:18:04.976
ONE AND THE DATA ON THAT'S

02:18:05.043 --> 02:18:07.145
PRETTY STUNNING BECAUSE IF

02:18:07.212 --> 02:18:08.480
YOU'RE INTENT GREATER HIGH

02:18:08.546 --> 02:18:09.581
SCHOOL YOU HAVE A TRANSITION

02:18:09.648 --> 02:18:10.882
YOU'RE NOT GOING.

02:18:10.949 --> 02:18:12.150
TO THE NUMBERS ARE THAT THE

02:18:12.217 --> 02:18:13.585
NUMBERS OF PEOPLE KIDS THE

02:18:13.652 --> 02:18:16.187
TRANSITIONS ABOUT ZERO ONE IF

02:18:16.254 --> 02:18:17.689
YOU'RE LUCKY.

02:18:17.756 --> 02:18:19.290
TO CAMPBELL UNION BROUGHT THIS

02:18:19.357 --> 02:18:21.426
PROGRAM INTO THEIR SCHOOL AND IN

02:18:21.493 --> 02:18:24.029
THE FIRST SEMESTER. THIRTY OUT

02:18:24.095 --> 02:18:25.163
OF THIRTY TWO KIDS TRANSITIONED

02:18:25.230 --> 02:18:27.298
INTO ENGLISH.

02:18:27.365 --> 02:18:28.566
AND SO.

02:18:28.633 --> 02:18:31.302
OF THAT THE DISTRICT DECIDED TO

02:18:31.369 --> 02:18:32.704
DOUBLE THE SIZE OF THE PROGRAM.

02:18:32.771 --> 02:18:35.440
IN FACT OUR BEST ASSESSMENT IS

02:18:35.507 --> 02:18:37.308
OR YOU KNOW WHATEVER WHAT OF OUR

02:18:37.375 --> 02:18:40.145
DISTRICTS DONE -- ARE DISTRICTS

02:18:40.211 --> 02:18:42.247
PALMDALE STARTED WITH ONE

02:18:42.313 --> 02:18:44.049
THEY'VE EXPANDED TO THREE

02:18:44.115 --> 02:18:45.350
CLASSES WE'RE GOING TO FIGHT

02:18:45.417 --> 02:18:45.984
NEXT YEAR.

02:18:46.051 --> 02:18:48.453
SANTA ANA STARTED -- IN FOURTH

02:18:48.520 --> 02:18:49.788
GRADE THEY NOW HAVE A FULL

02:18:49.854 --> 02:18:51.890
PATHWAY.

02:18:51.956 --> 02:18:52.957
OUR OTHER DISTRICTS HAPPENED.

02:18:53.024 --> 02:18:56.561
NOW THE CHALLENGE IS FINDING OF

02:18:56.628 --> 02:18:58.496
COURSE BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT.

02:18:58.563 --> 02:18:59.731
ARE THERE ARE NO FREE LUNCHES

02:18:59.798 --> 02:19:02.100
THIS COSTS BECAUSE WE PAY FOR IN

02:19:02.167 --> 02:19:03.568
THE INDUSTRY TO COME IN AND GET

02:19:03.635 --> 02:19:05.570
THIS DONE.

02:19:05.637 --> 02:19:06.905
SO IN TERMS OF WHAT YOU KNOW

02:19:06.971 --> 02:19:10.375
WHAT'S THE SOLUTION -- NUMBER

02:19:10.442 --> 02:19:12.277
ONE IS THIS IS VOCATIONAL

02:19:12.343 --> 02:19:15.213
BECAUSE WE GIVE KIDS ACT I DON'T

02:19:15.280 --> 02:19:15.847
LIKE THAT WORD BUT IT'S CAREER

02:19:15.914 --> 02:19:17.115
TRAINING.

02:19:17.182 --> 02:19:20.819
WE GIVE KIDS AN OPTION. TO THEY

02:19:20.885 --> 02:19:22.921
WANT TO GO THE ACADEMIC ROUTE.

02:19:22.987 --> 02:19:23.555
WE'RE TRYING TO FIND A PATH FOR

02:19:23.621 --> 02:19:24.889
THAT.

02:19:24.956 --> 02:19:26.357
BUT BY THE END OF THAT FOURTH

02:19:26.424 --> 02:19:27.492
GRADE CLASS EVERYONE OF THOSE

02:19:27.559 --> 02:19:29.227
KIDS KNOW THAT EVERY JOB IN THE

02:19:29.294 --> 02:19:31.763
FILM ON A SET.

02:19:31.830 --> 02:19:33.098
SO THEY CAN DECIDE WHICH WAY.

02:19:33.164 --> 02:19:35.533
THEY WANT TO GO AND AGAIN THIS

02:19:35.600 --> 02:19:36.968
PURPOSE OF THIS ISN'T TO CREATE

02:19:37.035 --> 02:19:39.070
FILMMAKERS.

02:19:39.137 --> 02:19:40.572
IS TO CREATE LIFE LONG LEARNERS.

02:19:40.638 --> 02:19:42.974
OUR AND WE HAD AND I JUST GIVING

02:19:43.041 --> 02:19:46.077
YOU A SNIPPET OF OUR DATA -- AND

02:19:46.144 --> 02:19:49.714
IT'S BEEN PRETTY SPECTACULAR.

02:19:49.781 --> 02:19:50.949
I CAN'T.

02:19:51.015 --> 02:19:52.117
UNDER ESTá OVER YOU KNOW I

02:19:52.183 --> 02:19:53.718
CAN'T OVERESTIMATE IF YOU WILL

02:19:53.785 --> 02:19:56.621
THE IMPACT OF BRINGING IN THE

02:19:56.688 --> 02:19:58.189
PROFESSIONAL SIDE LOLLIES.

02:19:58.256 --> 02:19:59.858
AND OUR PARTNERSHIPS WITH

02:19:59.924 --> 02:20:01.292
INDUSTRY PEOPLE.

02:20:01.359 --> 02:20:02.827
BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN URGING FOLKS

02:20:02.894 --> 02:20:05.396
TO GIVE OUR KIDS -- INTERNSHIPS

02:20:05.463 --> 02:20:07.499
IN HIGH SCHOOL EVEN THOUGH THE

02:20:07.565 --> 02:20:10.368
USUALLY DON'T DO IT TO ABOLISH.

02:20:10.435 --> 02:20:12.303
AND A AND BECAUSE OF OUR KIDS.

02:20:12.370 --> 02:20:16.207
THEY KNOW ABOUT THE BUSINESS --

02:20:16.274 --> 02:20:17.842
THEY'VE BEEN PRETTY SATISFIED SO

02:20:17.909 --> 02:20:20.044
THE CATEGORY AND OTHER FOLKS --

02:20:20.111 --> 02:20:22.480
SO MANY OTHERS HAVE BEEN GIVING

02:20:22.547 --> 02:20:25.116
HIGH SCHOOL INTERNSHIPS VERSUS --

02:20:25.183 --> 02:20:26.151
COLLEGE.

02:20:26.217 --> 02:20:29.487
ONE SO -- WITHOUT MORE.

02:20:29.554 --> 02:20:33.858
GONNA TRY TO KEEP MY TIME.

02:20:33.925 --> 02:20:34.459
SO EVERYBODY CAN GET ELECTION

02:20:34.526 --> 02:20:35.527
TIME.

02:20:35.593 --> 02:20:37.228
SO ONE IF I WERE TO HAVE ASKS

02:20:37.295 --> 02:20:37.562
ONE WOULD BE.

02:20:37.629 --> 02:20:38.963
IF WE CAN WORK WITH THE RULES SO

02:20:39.030 --> 02:20:41.065
THAT MY TEACHERS AT VERSUS MY

02:20:41.132 --> 02:20:43.368
MENTORS -- IN THE DISTRICTS THAT

02:20:43.434 --> 02:20:46.604
WE HAVE CAN QUALIFY FOR C. T.

02:20:46.671 --> 02:20:50.975
FUNDING. TO THE UP THE THE OTHER

02:20:51.042 --> 02:20:52.277
BIG DEAL HERE IS.

02:20:52.343 --> 02:20:53.845
YOU KNOW THE TYPE.

02:20:53.912 --> 02:20:56.414
FINANCES THAT THE DISTRICTS HAVE.

02:20:56.481 --> 02:20:59.450
AND WHAT I'VE NOTED IS THAT YOUR

02:20:59.517 --> 02:20:59.951
TWO DIFFERENT TYPES OF

02:21:00.018 --> 02:21:01.085
SUPERINTENDENTS.

02:21:01.152 --> 02:21:02.320
THEIR SUPERINTENDENTS WHO ARE

02:21:02.387 --> 02:21:03.855
WANTING TO TAKE THE RESOURCES

02:21:03.922 --> 02:21:05.056
AND INVEST.

02:21:05.123 --> 02:21:08.126
AND GET OUT COMES -- WHERE

02:21:08.193 --> 02:21:09.861
THEY'RE GETTING AND THEY ARE

02:21:09.928 --> 02:21:11.095
GETTING ALL COMES?

02:21:11.162 --> 02:21:12.130
OUT WHERE THEY'RE HAVING

02:21:12.197 --> 02:21:15.166
EXPANDED ATTENDANCE -- INCREASED

02:21:15.233 --> 02:21:17.068
TENANTS AND THEY SEE VALUE -- IN

02:21:17.135 --> 02:21:18.803
DIFFERENT WAYS EVEN IN UP TO AND

02:21:18.870 --> 02:21:20.471
INCLUDING THEIR ADA SO THAT'S AN

02:21:20.538 --> 02:21:21.739
INVESTOR SUPERINTENDENT.

02:21:21.806 --> 02:21:23.341
AND THE OTHER ONES ARE I'M JUST

02:21:23.408 --> 02:21:24.776
SO OVERWHELMED BY MY BUDGET

02:21:24.843 --> 02:21:26.578
DEFICITS I REALLY CAN'T AFFORD

02:21:26.644 --> 02:21:28.947
TO BRING IN AN OUTSIDE PROGRAM I

02:21:29.013 --> 02:21:29.547
GOT TO TAKE CARE OF THE FOLKS

02:21:29.614 --> 02:21:30.048
THAT ARE IN HERE.

02:21:30.114 --> 02:21:33.117
AND THOSE ARE VERY THAT'S A VERY

02:21:33.184 --> 02:21:34.085
CHALLENGING ENVIRONMENT.

02:21:34.152 --> 02:21:35.954
SO IF THERE'S A WAY TO ALLOCATE

02:21:36.020 --> 02:21:37.155
OR IN CASE ENHANCE FUNDING.

02:21:37.222 --> 02:21:39.090
SO THAT DISTRICTS THAT WANT TO

02:21:39.157 --> 02:21:40.925
INVEST CAN GET SOME ASSISTANCE

02:21:40.992 --> 02:21:41.993
IN INVESTING.

02:21:42.060 --> 02:21:43.428
AND SO THAT'S OUR SECOND THING

02:21:43.494 --> 02:21:45.230
THE OTHER FINAL POINT I WOULD

02:21:45.296 --> 02:21:46.531
LIKE TO MAKE IS THAT.

02:21:46.598 --> 02:21:48.833
WE ASK AND WE GO INTO THE MOST

02:21:48.900 --> 02:21:50.501
CHALLENGED.

02:21:50.568 --> 02:21:52.637
DISTRICTS AND WHEN WE GO INTO A

02:21:52.704 --> 02:21:54.072
DISTRICT WE SAY WELL OF COURSE

02:21:54.138 --> 02:21:55.340
WE'RE HERE TO SERVE YOU.

02:21:55.406 --> 02:21:56.507
BUT GIVE US YOUR MOST

02:21:56.574 --> 02:21:58.610
CHALLENGING ENVIRONMENT -- WE

02:21:58.676 --> 02:22:01.779
ARE IN THE NORTH AND SOUTH ROUTE

02:22:01.846 --> 02:22:03.281
IN -- IN.

02:22:03.348 --> 02:22:05.316
BRAWLEY ALL THE WAY UP TO ALLEN

02:22:05.383 --> 02:22:06.251
WRONG.

02:22:06.317 --> 02:22:09.621
BROUGH -- WE ARE -- PALMDALE

02:22:09.687 --> 02:22:12.624
OXNARD -- AND WE SAY THAT WE ARE

02:22:12.690 --> 02:22:14.859
THE LATINO FILM INSTITUTE YOU

02:22:14.926 --> 02:22:16.194
CINEMA PROJECT.

02:22:16.261 --> 02:22:18.363
NOT BECAUSE WE'RE ONLY FOCUSING

02:22:18.429 --> 02:22:19.864
ON WHAT THE NO KIDS.

02:22:19.931 --> 02:22:22.834
IT IS BECAUSE THIS PROGRAM WAS

02:22:22.901 --> 02:22:24.002
DEVELOPED BY THE LEFT IN A

02:22:24.068 --> 02:22:25.103
COMMUNITY AND WE HAVE --

02:22:25.169 --> 02:22:26.838
EXPENSIVE TURN WHEN IT AS A GIFT

02:22:26.905 --> 02:22:28.206
TO ALL CHILDREN.

02:22:28.273 --> 02:22:29.440
SO IT DOESN'T MATTER WHETHER

02:22:29.507 --> 02:22:30.875
YOU'RE AT RISK.

02:22:30.942 --> 02:22:32.343
YOU CAN BENEFIT FROM THIS.

02:22:32.410 --> 02:22:34.746
BUT THAT ARE AT RISK COMMUNITY

02:22:34.812 --> 02:22:37.682
AND THAT'S EVERYBODY -- GETS A

02:22:37.749 --> 02:22:39.550

02:30:40.131 --> 02:30:40.931
OUR PEOPLE FROM.

02:30:40.998 --> 02:30:42.666
OUR STATE BUT I MOVED HERE FROM

02:30:42.733 --> 02:30:44.402
THERE BECAUSE CALIFORNIA HAD

02:30:44.468 --> 02:30:46.937
SUCH A RICH CULTURE AND SUCH AN

02:30:47.004 --> 02:30:49.373
IMPORTANT.

02:30:49.440 --> 02:30:50.608
PLACE FOR BRINGING IN.

02:30:50.674 --> 02:30:52.777
VOICES THAT CAN DO WHAT WHATEVER

02:30:52.843 --> 02:30:54.278
FEELS RIGHT TO THEM THERE'S SUCH

02:30:54.345 --> 02:30:55.579
FREEDOM HERE THERE'S SUCH A

02:30:55.646 --> 02:30:56.947
SUPPORTIVE COMMUNITY AND A

02:30:57.014 --> 02:30:58.983
NETWORK IN A FABRIC OF

02:30:59.049 --> 02:31:00.684
PROFESSIONALS FROM ALL KINDS OF

02:31:00.751 --> 02:31:02.052
GENRES AND I THINK.

02:31:02.119 --> 02:31:03.621
AS MENTIONED EARLIER IN THE

02:31:03.687 --> 02:31:04.989
STUDIES THAT WERE PRESENTED.

02:31:05.055 --> 02:31:07.091
THE VARIETY THEM INDUSTRIES JUST

02:31:07.158 --> 02:31:09.660
THE HUGE DIVERSITY OF CREATIVE

02:31:09.727 --> 02:31:12.329
INDUSTRIES IN THIS STATE MAKES.

02:31:12.396 --> 02:31:14.365
MAKES FOR A UNIQUE CULTURE THAT

02:31:14.432 --> 02:31:16.400
EXISTS PRETTY MUCH KNOW WHERE

02:31:16.467 --> 02:31:17.001
ELSE.

02:31:17.067 --> 02:31:20.471
AND AND SO FOR US -- CREATIVITY

02:31:20.538 --> 02:31:21.705
IS ALSO AT THE HEART OF

02:31:21.772 --> 02:31:23.207
ENTREPRENEURSHIP.

02:31:23.274 --> 02:31:25.176
AND PRETTY MUCH ALL OF OUR

02:31:25.242 --> 02:31:26.510
MEMBERS ARE ENTREPRENEURS IN ONE

02:31:26.577 --> 02:31:28.112
SENSE OR ANOTHER WE ALSO

02:31:28.179 --> 02:31:29.747
REPRESENT SOME OF THE SMALLEST

02:31:29.814 --> 02:31:30.648
BUSINESSES.

02:31:30.714 --> 02:31:32.416
YOU CAN THAT CAN EXIST A SONG

02:31:32.483 --> 02:31:35.986
WRITER IS OF FREESTANDING SOLO

02:31:36.053 --> 02:31:37.521
ENTERPRISE AND THEY CAN.

02:31:37.588 --> 02:31:39.089
MAKE A LOT OF MONEY FROM ONE

02:31:39.156 --> 02:31:41.959
SINGLE HIT THERE LIKE THE GOLD

02:31:42.026 --> 02:31:43.861
DIGGERS OF THE PAST SO.

02:31:43.928 --> 02:31:44.595
THIS IS IT THIS IS THE WAY THAT

02:31:44.662 --> 02:31:46.163
OUR ECONOMY IS OFTEN FUNCTIONED

02:31:46.230 --> 02:31:47.198
AS BOOMER BUST IN THE MUSIC

02:31:47.264 --> 02:31:50.067
INDUSTRY IS NO DIFFERENT -- OUR

02:31:50.134 --> 02:31:51.068
MEMBERS ARE THE CREATIVE

02:31:51.135 --> 02:31:52.269
PROFESSIONALS THAT MAKE THE

02:31:52.336 --> 02:31:53.971
MUSIC YOU LISTEN TO TODAY YOU

02:31:54.038 --> 02:31:55.272
YOU KNOW THEIR WORK WHETHER YOU

02:31:55.339 --> 02:31:58.142
KNOW THE PEOPLE OR NOT AND AND

02:31:58.209 --> 02:31:59.710
IT AND I'VE AND I NOTICED THAT

02:31:59.777 --> 02:32:00.845
FROM THE STUDY WE ARE HARD TO

02:32:00.911 --> 02:32:01.645
QUANTIFY.

02:32:01.712 --> 02:32:03.247
WITHIN THE ECONOMY BECAUSE SO

02:32:03.314 --> 02:32:05.082
MANY OF OUR OUR MEMBERS AND THE

02:32:05.149 --> 02:32:06.784
PEOPLE MAKING THE MUSIC YOU EVEN

02:32:06.851 --> 02:32:07.818
HEAR ON THE RADIO OR THAT ARE

02:32:07.885 --> 02:32:09.153
TRENDING ON SPOTIFY.

02:32:09.220 --> 02:32:11.789
ARE MADE BY PEOPLE WHO DON'T FLY

02:32:11.856 --> 02:32:13.090
OVER THE RADAR AND THEY'RE NOT

02:32:13.157 --> 02:32:14.525
HIRED BY MAJOR CORPORATIONS AND

02:32:14.592 --> 02:32:16.627
THEY'RE NOT ON THE EASY TO READ

02:32:16.694 --> 02:32:18.128
TAX ROLLS AND THOSE SORTS OF

02:32:18.195 --> 02:32:20.331
THINGS BECAUSE THEY ARE.

02:32:20.397 --> 02:32:22.600
THEY'RE HUSTLERS.

02:32:22.666 --> 02:32:23.501
THAT IS THE THAT IS THE KEY

02:32:23.567 --> 02:32:25.636
PIECE OF OUR OF OUR OF ECONOMY

02:32:25.703 --> 02:32:26.937
THOUGH BECAUSE SOME OF THOSE

02:32:27.004 --> 02:32:28.572
HUSTLERS WHO ARE WORKING ON THE

02:32:28.639 --> 02:32:29.673
STREETS AND MAY NOT BE EVEN

02:32:29.740 --> 02:32:31.242
EARNING ENOUGH TO PAY TAXES FROM

02:32:31.308 --> 02:32:32.209
THE MUSIC CAREER.

02:32:32.276 --> 02:32:34.678
MAY EVENTUALLY GO ON TO BECOME

02:32:34.745 --> 02:32:37.014
MAJOR ARTISTS AND SO WE WE WE

02:32:37.081 --> 02:32:39.083
REALLY TRY AND MAKE SURE THAT WE

02:32:39.149 --> 02:32:41.418
SUPPORT AND REPRESENT THOSE

02:32:41.485 --> 02:32:44.154
PEOPLE AS WELL. ONE UNIQUE THING

02:32:44.221 --> 02:32:45.389
ABOUT THE ARTS OBVIOUSLY AS

02:32:45.456 --> 02:32:46.190
WE'VE ALL BEEN TALKING ABOUT

02:32:46.257 --> 02:32:48.492

THE CREATIVITY AND DETERMINATION

02:32:54.064 --> 02:32:57.535
NECESSARY FOR SUCCESS -- OUR

02:32:57.601 --> 02:32:59.770

AND THE SCHOOLS THAT WE PARTNERS

02:48:48.084 --> 02:48:50.186
WITH I SHOULD SAY ARE THE

02:48:50.253 --> 02:48:50.820
SCHOOLS THAT HAVE BEEN

02:48:50.887 --> 02:48:53.022

NOT ONLY ARE THEY TITLE ONE

02:48:57.260 --> 02:48:59.996
SCHOOLS THEIR SCHOOLS WITH KIDS --

02:49:00.063 --> 02:49:03.199
AND FAMILIES WHO HAVE LOW INCOME

02:49:03.266 --> 02:49:04.834
THEY'RE ALSO SCHOOLS THAT ARE.

02:49:04.901 --> 02:49:05.935
ESSENTIALLY LABELED ON

02:49:06.002 --> 02:49:07.704

02:49:10.540 --> 02:49:12.141
THAT FOLLOWS -- THOSE

02:49:12.208 --> 02:49:16.012
COMMUNITIES -- AND CAN BE REALLY --

02:49:16.079 --> 02:49:17.380
NOT SUPPORTIVE TO THEIR IS

02:49:17.447 --> 02:49:19.282
THRIVING AND SUCCESS AND PART OF

02:49:19.349 --> 02:49:20.383
WHAT WE DO WITH WORKING IN THESE

02:49:20.450 --> 02:49:21.751
HIGH PROFILE ARTISTS WORKING

02:49:21.818 --> 02:49:23.119
WITH THE KIDS BRINGING MEDIAN

02:49:23.186 --> 02:49:24.487
VISIBILITY THE SCHOOLS IS TO

02:49:24.554 --> 02:49:25.622
SHOW THAT.

02:49:25.688 --> 02:49:26.956
THE KIDS IN THE SCHOOLS HAVE

02:49:27.023 --> 02:49:27.957
JUST AS MUCH ABILITY IN

02:49:28.024 --> 02:49:29.292
POTENTIAL AS ANY OTHER SCHOOL

02:49:29.359 --> 02:49:31.528
YEAH AND TO HELP ALL THE THAT

02:49:31.594 --> 02:49:32.862
COMMUNITY THE TEACHERS THE

02:49:32.929 --> 02:49:34.430
STUDENTS TO SEE.

02:49:34.497 --> 02:49:38.735
THEY ARE AT POTENTIAL NOT AT

02:49:38.801 --> 02:49:39.302
RISK YOU HAVE TO REALLY HAVE

02:49:39.369 --> 02:49:39.736
SUCCESS [inaudible]

02:49:39.802 --> 02:49:40.503
SO.

02:49:40.570 --> 02:49:42.071
THE RESULTS THAT WE FOCUSED ON

02:49:42.138 --> 02:49:44.641
AND WHEN WE WERE ORIGINALLY --

02:49:44.707 --> 02:49:46.276
CREATED IT WAS BASED ON A

02:49:46.342 --> 02:49:49.512
NATIONAL PILOT -- THAT LOOKED AT

02:49:49.579 --> 02:49:50.613
HIGH PRIORITY SCHOOLS ACROSS THE

02:49:50.680 --> 02:49:54.450
NATION AND PROVIDED ARTS

02:49:54.517 --> 02:49:56.152
EDUCATION AND THEN LOOKED AT

02:49:56.219 --> 02:49:57.921
OTHER SCHOOLS THAT JUST WERE

02:49:57.987 --> 02:49:58.555
JUST RECEIVE ADDITIONAL FUNDING

02:49:58.621 --> 02:50:00.990
AND THE RESULTS WERE SIGNIFICANT

02:50:01.057 --> 02:50:02.225
THAT THOSE KIDS WERE PERFORMING

02:50:02.292 --> 02:50:03.526
BETTER IN SCHOOL.

02:50:03.593 --> 02:50:04.928
AND THAT'S TRUE IN OUR PROGRAM

02:50:04.994 --> 02:50:06.663
BUT ONE THING THAT WE HAVE FOUND

02:50:06.729 --> 02:50:08.464
AND THAT WE'RE REALLY LOOKING AT

02:50:08.531 --> 02:50:09.799
AND DIGGING INTO EVALUATING.

02:50:09.866 --> 02:50:12.702
IS WHEN WE WORK WITH OUR SCHOOLS.%

02:50:12.769 --> 02:50:14.971
OUR PARTNER SCHOOLS THE TEACHERS

02:50:15.038 --> 02:50:16.406
THE PRINCIPALS THE COMMUNITIES

02:50:16.472 --> 02:50:18.942
REPORT TO RENT DRAMATIC SHIFTS

02:50:19.008 --> 02:50:19.475
IN THE SCHOOL CULTURE AND

02:50:19.542 --> 02:50:20.944
CLIMATE.

02:50:21.010 --> 02:50:22.579
AND WHAT DOES THAT MEAN TO US

02:50:22.645 --> 02:50:24.113
OUR TEACHERS ARE MOTIVATED AND

02:50:24.180 --> 02:50:25.515
ENGAGE AND THEY FEEL LIKE THEY

02:50:39.796 --> 02:50:41.497
LOOKING AT TEACHER SURVEYS AND

02:50:41.564 --> 02:50:43.166
HOW THEY ARE ENGAGED IN THE

02:50:43.232 --> 02:50:44.968
CLASSROOM IN THE LEARNING

02:50:45.034 --> 02:50:47.203

SCHOOLS WHEREFAMILIES ARE

02:50:52.909 --> 02:50:54.844

THOSE INITIAL INDICATORS ARE ARE

02:51:15.932 --> 02:51:17.634
REALLY ABOUT READING IS TO LEARN

02:51:17.700 --> 02:51:19.335

02:51:28.311 --> 02:51:30.113
STUDY INDICATORS AND WHAT WE

02:51:30.179 --> 02:51:31.147
NEED TO DO IS CREATE AN

02:51:31.214 --> 02:51:32.181

THROUGH THE CLASSROOM -- IT'S

02:52:34.811 --> 02:52:37.013
IMPORTANT THAT AS THE TOOL AS WE

02:52:37.080 --> 02:52:39.282
WANT TO USE THE ARTS FOR THAT IT

02:52:39.348 --> 02:52:41.684
IS TIED TO STANDARDS IN THAT --

STRATEGIES ARE REAL.

02:52:57.366 --> 02:52:58.601
SO THAT NOT ONLY THAT THE DO THE

02:52:58.668 --> 02:53:00.970
TEACHERS KNOW HOW TO ARTICULATE

02:53:01.037 --> 02:53:02.238

THAT ARE LEARNING COMMON CORE

02:53:05.041 --> 02:53:06.476
STRATEGIES IN THE LA MATH.

02:53:06.542 --> 02:53:08.010
BUT THAT ALSO THE STUDENTS ARE

02:53:08.077 --> 02:53:08.745
