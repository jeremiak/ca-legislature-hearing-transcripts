QUESTIONS ARE MORE ALONG THE

00:04:24.464 --> 00:04:27.567
LINES OF I THINK THE SECOND-

00:04:27.634 --> 00:04:29.302

COMING UP OVER AND OVER AND

00:04:41.147 --> 00:04:43.116
OVER AGAIN AND I THINK FOR GOOD

00:04:43.182 --> 00:04:46.319
REASONS IS. HOW DO WE HOW DO

00:04:46.386 --> 00:04:48.154
WE- USE THE FACT THAT WE'RE

00:04:48.221 --> 00:04:49.889
EXPANDING TRANSPORTATION PUBLIC

00:04:49.956 --> 00:04:51.991
TRANSPORTATION. AND THE PARTS

SO I GUESS I'M CONCERNED THAT

00:05:05.171 --> 00:05:07.573
ONE I WOULD ASK HOW HOW DO WE

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:09.942
GET THERE. AND CAN WE GET THERE

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:11.344

TWO SO THAT'S YEARS FROM NOW.

00:05:21.654 --> 00:05:22.955
MEANWHILE ALL THESE DECISION

00:05:23.022 --> 00:05:24.991
ARE BEING MADE ABOUT BILLIONS

00:05:25.058 --> 00:05:26.392
OF DOLLARS BOTH AT THE STATE

00:05:26.459 --> 00:05:28.461
LEVEL AT THE COUNTY LEVEL AND

00:05:28.528 --> 00:05:30.263
LOCAL LEVELS. BILLIONS AND

00:05:30.329 --> 00:05:31.364
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS ARE BEING

00:05:31.431 --> 00:05:33.066
SPENT WITHOUT THIS KIND OF%

00:05:33.132 --> 00:05:36.002
ASSESSMENT SO- I'M NOT SURE

00:05:36.069 --> 00:05:37.503
WHAT THE QUESTION IS WHAT HOW

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:38.905

RESPOND TO THAT CONCERT WELL I

00:05:41.374 --> 00:05:43.042
THINK THIS BUILDS ON EXISTING

00:05:43.109 --> 00:05:44.944
EFFORTS THAT HAVE BEEN GOING ON

00:05:45.011 --> 00:05:45.678

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:53.219
ALL THE DIFFERENT DID EUROPE

00:05:53.286 --> 00:05:55.555
ARMS HOW DO WE BETTER ALLY

00:05:55.621 --> 00:05:57.256
THOSE THERE'S A BEEN BEEN A

00:05:57.323 --> 00:05:59.192
BUNCH OF AFTER ON PROVIDING TO

AS ON THAT TO LOCAL. AND

00:06:01.794 --> 00:06:03.596
LOOKING AT THE DIFFERENT HOW

00:06:03.663 --> 00:06:05.631
CAN FIND IN THE LINE WORK

00:06:05.698 --> 00:06:09.535
TOGETHER I THINK THE ALLEGED IN

00:06:09.602 --> 00:06:11.471
PASSING THE OF REQUIRE THIS WAS

00:06:11.537 --> 00:06:12.605
OKAY WE'VE DONE A LOT OF THAT

00:06:12.672 --> 00:06:14.874
BUT LET'S WHAT ALL THAT AT DONE

00:06:14.941 --> 00:06:16.542
OVER THE- SO WE AND THEN COME

00:06:16.609 --> 00:06:18.144
WITH IDEAS ON HOW WE BETTER

00:06:18.211 --> 00:06:19.011
COORDINATE THAT SO WE

00:06:19.078 --> 00:06:20.146
COMPLETELY AGREE THAT. THINGS

00:06:20.213 --> 00:06:22.982
NEED TO BE FASTER BUT I THINK

00:06:23.049 --> 00:06:24.717
ALSO SO MUCH WORK IT'S BEEN

00:06:24.784 --> 00:06:26.185
DONE THAT THAT THE LEGISLATURE

00:06:26.252 --> 00:06:29.222
I THINK WANTED US TO ASSESS IS

00:06:29.288 --> 00:06:34.594
ON AND PROVE THAT SO WE IS BILL

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:43.870
POSSIBLE THE. WHAT IS GRAY. I

00:06:43.936 --> 00:06:44.971
DO NOT DISAGREE THAT WE NEED TO

00:06:45.037 --> 00:06:51.244
LOOK. ABILITY ISSUES AND TO

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:53.646
DEAL WITH- DISPLACEMENT AND

00:06:53.713 --> 00:06:56.015
OTHER ISSUES SO I. WHICH IS

00:06:56.082 --> 00:06:59.085
THAT WE- AND YOU THINK IN THIS

00:06:59.152 --> 00:07:00.987
ASSESSMENT I KNOW YOU. IT'S THE

00:07:01.053 --> 00:07:02.421
STATE'S TRANSPORTATION AND

00:07:02.488 --> 00:07:04.323
HOUSING GRANT PROGRAM BUT HOW

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:05.892
DOES THIS RELATE TO WHAT'S

00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:07.760
GOING ON AT THE COUNTY LEVEL

00:07:07.827 --> 00:07:09.662
REGIONAL LEVEL THERE'S LOTS OF

00:07:09.729 --> 00:07:11.430
FUNDING GOING ON THERE AND AT

00:07:11.497 --> 00:07:13.800
THE LOCAL LEVEL AND JUST WHAT

00:07:13.866 --> 00:07:17.236
I'VE HEARD- READ IS THAT- AS

00:07:17.303 --> 00:07:18.771
TWO EXAMPLES THE BART IN THE

00:07:18.838 --> 00:07:22.608
BAY AREA AND- LA. AND SET THE

00:07:22.675 --> 00:07:24.911
RIDERSHIP- HAS GONE DOWN. AND

00:07:24.977 --> 00:07:27.747
YET HERE WE ARE USING THAT AS A

00:07:27.814 --> 00:07:29.515
REASON TO BUILD MORE HOUSING.

00:07:29.582 --> 00:07:31.384
ALONG ALONG THE TRANSIT

00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:34.253
CORRIDORS. SO I GUESS I'M JUST

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:38.024
KIND OF HI. WE'RE PUTTING THIS

00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:38.858
OFF FOR TWO YEARS IS THERE ANY

00:07:38.925 --> 00:07:42.662
WAY OF FAST FORWARD THAT WE

00:07:42.728 --> 00:07:44.630
COULD DO THIS QUICKER YOU'RE

00:07:44.697 --> 00:07:46.699
ASKING FOR ONE POSITION. I

00:07:46.766 --> 00:07:48.868
DON'T KNOW IF IT WOULD TAKE TO

00:07:48.935 --> 00:07:52.238
POSITIONS TO DO IT SOONER- BUT-

00:07:52.305 --> 00:07:52.872
I'M JUST SAYING I THINK THERE'S

00:07:52.939 --> 00:07:55.208
AN- WHICH WE'RE TRYING TO

00:07:55.274 --> 00:07:57.009
ADDRESS A HUMANITARIAN CRISIS

00:07:57.076 --> 00:07:58.010
LITTLE HOUSING RIGHT

00:07:58.077 --> 00:08:00.713
TRANSPORTATION. USED AS A MAJOR

00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:03.716
COMPONENT OF HOW TO ADDRESS

00:08:03.783 --> 00:08:05.918
THAT REZONING IN ALL OF THIS. I

00:08:05.985 --> 00:08:06.919
FEEL LIKE WE'RE MAKING

00:08:06.986 --> 00:08:08.387
DECISIONS WITHOUT THE BENEFIT

00:08:08.454 --> 00:08:10.022
OF THIS INFORMATION AND THIS

00:08:10.089 --> 00:08:11.557

ON THE STATUTORY DEADLINES- I

THINK. IS FAR AS LOOKING AT

JUST THE STATE PLAN I MEAN YOU

00:08:24.203 --> 00:08:25.638
KNOW MY VIEWS THAT WE WANT TO

00:08:25.705 --> 00:08:26.305

CERTAINLY WORK WITH STAFF TO

00:08:36.916 --> 00:08:38.317

FAR AS IT PROGRESSED THERE ARE

00:08:55.501 --> 00:08:57.203
AN AWFUL LOT OF THE LIGHTS

00:08:57.270 --> 00:08:58.905
BEING APPLIED FOR AGENCY BY

00:08:58.971 --> 00:09:01.707
AGENCY. AND I'M A LITTLE

00:09:01.774 --> 00:09:03.776
CONCERNED ABOUT THE NUMBERS

00:09:03.843 --> 00:09:06.112
THAT WE'RE BUILDING. IT'S PART

00:09:06.178 --> 00:09:08.147
OF THE BASE AND WE HAVE TO BE

00:09:08.214 --> 00:09:10.950
CAUTIOUS OF THE BASE BECAUSE WE

00:09:11.017 --> 00:09:13.052
WERE ONLY PRECARIOUSLY BALANCED

00:09:13.119 --> 00:09:14.453
AND IT DOES SEEM LIKE THERE ARE

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:16.956
A LOT OF- DEPARTMENT SUTTER

00:09:17.023 --> 00:09:18.658
STAFFING UP IF YOU WILL SO MY

00:09:18.724 --> 00:09:20.660
POINT IS GOING TO BE VERY

00:09:20.726 --> 00:09:22.762
DISCERNING ABOUT THAT AND- RE

00:09:22.828 --> 00:09:24.463
SEEKING THE- BEST OF

00:09:24.530 --> 00:09:26.365
JUSTIFICATIONS. FOR THE

00:09:26.432 --> 00:09:28.501
POSITION THAT'S JUST A GENERAL

00:09:28.567 --> 00:09:30.202
OBSERVATION AS WE PROCEED.

00:09:30.269 --> 00:09:32.738
THANK YOU SENATOR NIELSEN- THIS

00:09:32.805 --> 00:09:35.374

00:09:35.441 --> 00:09:37.043
AND ONE AT. PUT A FINER POINT

00:09:37.109 --> 00:09:39.445
ON IT BECAUSE IT I THINK CENTER

00:09:39.512 --> 00:09:40.713
DID NIELSEN IS CORRECTED IN

00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:42.548

AT. WHERE WE'RE GONNA EXPAND

00:09:45.251 --> 00:09:46.719
RESOURCES I THINK WE HAVE TO BE

00:09:46.786 --> 00:09:48.421
WISE ABOUT HOW WE GROW

00:09:48.487 --> 00:09:50.289
GOVERNMENT BUT THIS IS A LITTLE

00:09:50.356 --> 00:09:53.292
BIT. CONCERNING BECAUSE- WHEN

00:09:53.359 --> 00:09:54.560
GOVERNOR BROWN DID THE

00:09:54.627 --> 00:09:56.762
REORGANIZATION HOW HOUSING AND

00:09:56.829 --> 00:09:58.130
TRANSPORTATION WERE SEPARATED

00:09:58.197 --> 00:10:00.566
IN SEPARATE AGENCIES AND ONE OF

00:10:00.633 --> 00:10:01.801
THE THINGS THAT WAS. AND AS A

00:10:01.867 --> 00:10:06.939
CONSEQUENCE- WHICH AT A

00:10:07.006 --> 00:10:08.140
COMMITTEE THAT WAS NOT PART OF

00:10:08.207 --> 00:10:09.408
HIS REORGANIZATION WAS

00:10:09.475 --> 00:10:12.511
ESTABLISHED BY- LEGISLATION IT

00:10:12.578 --> 00:10:15.414
WAS CLEAN UP LEGISLATION. AND A

00:10:15.481 --> 00:10:16.649
COMMITTEE WAS SET UP WITH

00:10:16.716 --> 00:10:18.217
HOUSING ALL THE HOUSING

00:10:18.284 --> 00:10:20.286
DEPARTMENT AND THAT ALL OF THE

00:10:20.353 --> 00:10:21.887
TRANSPORTATION DEPARTMENT'S TO

00:10:21.954 --> 00:10:25.591
MEET ON A REGULAR BASIS. AND IT

00:10:25.658 --> 00:10:27.026
WAS THERE THAT IT WAS

00:10:27.093 --> 00:10:29.562
DISCOVERED THAT THERE WAS A

00:10:29.628 --> 00:10:32.164
DISCONNECT BETWEEN THE PUBLIC

00:10:32.231 --> 00:10:34.433
TRANSIT. PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION

00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:35.768
CONSTRUCTION FUN BUT WHATEVER

00:10:35.835 --> 00:10:39.138
THAT PROGRAM IS. I IT THAT WERE

00:10:39.205 --> 00:10:41.374
GRANTED. TO TRANSPORTATION

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:44.510
AGENCIES. AND THE LOCAL

00:10:44.577 --> 00:10:47.313
SURROUNDING CITY OR COUNTY THAT

00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:49.181
CONTROL THE LAND USE OF

00:10:49.248 --> 00:10:51.550
POLICIES THE MONEY WAS GIVEN ON

00:10:51.617 --> 00:10:52.685
THE UNDERSTANDING THAT

00:10:52.752 --> 00:10:53.886
INCREASED DENSITIES WOULD OCCUR

00:10:53.953 --> 00:10:55.855
ALONG MAJOR TRANSPORTATION

00:10:55.921 --> 00:10:57.990
ROUTES THE REASON THAT'S

00:10:58.057 --> 00:11:00.159
IMPORTANT IS BECAUSE- IT

00:11:00.226 --> 00:11:02.428
ENCOURAGED. EIGHT WHY VARIETY

00:11:02.495 --> 00:11:03.729
OF INCOME LEVELS TO TAKE PUBLIC

00:11:03.796 --> 00:11:08.300
TRANSPORTATION. AND. AND SO THE

00:11:08.367 --> 00:11:09.602
MONEY WOULD GRANTED MOSTLY TO

00:11:09.668 --> 00:11:15.007
BIG CITIES. AND THE LOCAL LAND

00:11:15.074 --> 00:11:16.842
USE AUTHORITIES MOSTLY CITIES

00:11:16.909 --> 00:11:19.945
WOULD THEN REFUSED TO UP ZONE

00:11:20.012 --> 00:11:22.081
THE AREA- AND BECAUSE THEY WERE

00:11:22.148 --> 00:11:23.115
PART OF THE CONTRACT THERE WAS

00:11:23.182 --> 00:11:24.550
NO OPPORTUNITY TO CLAW BACK

00:11:24.617 --> 00:11:26.452
MONEY THAT HAD BEEN GRANTED TO

00:11:26.519 --> 00:11:30.456
THOSE COMMUNITIES- AND SO- SO I

00:11:30.523 --> 00:11:32.024
JUST GET CONCERNED WITH THAT

00:11:32.091 --> 00:11:34.193
NOW WE- WE'VE TAKEN IT OUT OF

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:34.994
THE PURVIEW OF THE

00:11:35.061 --> 00:11:37.196
TRANSPORTATION IN THE HOUSE.

00:11:37.263 --> 00:11:39.265
ENTITIES AND PUT IT IN PR IS

00:11:39.331 --> 00:11:41.400
PARTICULAR REQUEST MMHM I'M

00:11:41.467 --> 00:11:43.669
LOOKING AT STRATEGIC GROWTH

00:11:43.736 --> 00:11:44.970
COUNCIL IN IN REALITY THE

00:11:45.037 --> 00:11:46.639
STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNCIL WAS

00:11:46.705 --> 00:11:49.442
WITH ESTABLISHED INITIALLY JUST

00:11:49.508 --> 00:11:53.145
TO. DO FUND FUNDS TO FIND LOCAL

00:11:53.212 --> 00:11:54.547
GOVERNMENTS TO WORK ON A

00:11:54.613 --> 00:11:56.615
REGIONAL BASIS AND NOW WE'RE

00:11:56.682 --> 00:11:58.517
KIND OF MOVING THINGS AWAY FROM

00:11:58.584 --> 00:11:59.718
THE TRANSPORTATION AND HOUSING

00:11:59.785 --> 00:12:01.087
AND MOVING THEM INTO AN ENTITY

00:12:01.153 --> 00:12:02.254
THAT'S CONTINUING TO GROW SO I

00:12:02.321 --> 00:12:03.823
JUST YEAH I'M I'M I'M I'M

00:12:03.889 --> 00:12:05.491
PREPARED TO. SUPPORT THIS

00:12:05.558 --> 00:12:07.526
RIGHT- I THINK IT NEEDS A

00:12:07.593 --> 00:12:09.528
LITTLE BIT MORE THOUGHT BUT-

00:12:09.595 --> 00:12:10.763
JUST IN TERMS OF THAT WHOLE

00:12:10.830 --> 00:12:13.232
SCENARIO- AND I GET CONCERNED

00:12:13.299 --> 00:12:18.637
BECAUSE. IT HEY DON'T THINK THE

00:12:18.704 --> 00:12:20.473
INVESTMENT IN ANY CD HAS BEEN

00:12:20.539 --> 00:12:23.309
MADE- THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT

00:12:23.375 --> 00:12:25.244
VACANCIES AND THE THERE'S NO

00:12:25.311 --> 00:12:28.514
HEAD OF THERE'S NO DIRECTOR AND

00:12:28.581 --> 00:12:29.648
THAT'S KIND OF BEEN A

00:12:29.715 --> 00:12:32.751
PERSISTENT ISSUE- THAT CREATES

00:12:32.818 --> 00:12:34.487
CONCERN BECAUSE HOUSING IS OUR

00:12:34.553 --> 00:12:35.988
NUMBER ONE ISSUE WE DON'T HAVE

00:12:36.055 --> 00:12:37.256

DIFFERENT AGENCIES AND SO I

00:12:53.139 --> 00:12:54.373

ADAPTATION AND RESILIENCE

00:31:26.050 --> 00:31:27.518
EFFORTS TO SOME OF THAT WOULD

00:31:27.585 --> 00:31:30.121
INCLUDE FUNDING TO HELP ENHANCE

00:31:30.188 --> 00:31:31.990
OUR EXISTING REQUIREMENTS TO

00:31:32.056 --> 00:31:33.291
IMPLEMENT THE ADAPTATION

00:31:33.358 --> 00:31:35.293
CLEARING HOUSE SPECIFICALLY WE

00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:37.328
HAVE HEARD THE CALL FOR THE NAY

pMETRICS THAT CAN REALLY HELP

00:31:56.681 --> 00:31:58.416
THE STATE BETTER UNDERSTAND

00:31:58.483 --> 00:32:01.286
WATER ARE POLLS ON RESILIENCE.

00:32:01.352 --> 00:32:02.787
HOW DO WE TRACK AND MEASURE OUR

00:32:02.854 --> 00:32:03.855
PROGRESS OVER TIME TOWARDS

00:32:03.921 --> 00:32:05.356

EXPANSION. OF THE STATE'S

00:32:53.204 --> 00:32:54.172
CLIMATE RELATED RESEARCH AND

00:32:54.238 --> 00:32:56.074
TECHICAL ACTIVITIES AND THAT

00:32:56.140 --> 00:32:58.109
OVERALL THE GOVERNOR'S

00:32:58.176 --> 00:32:59.510
PROPOSALS A REASONABLE. HOWEVER

00:32:59.577 --> 00:33:00.211
THE LEGISLATURE COULD TAKE A

00:33:00.278 --> 00:33:01.079
SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT APPROACH OF

00:33:01.145 --> 00:33:02.914

ADAPTATION ACTIVITIES TO

00:33:16.694 --> 00:33:18.296

00:33:18.363 --> 00:33:20.698
AND GREATER ACCOUNTABILITY.

00:33:20.765 --> 00:33:22.633
VERY GOOD THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:29.006
QUESTION MANY. LET ME GO AHEAD

00:33:29.073 --> 00:33:30.341
AND START BECAUSE I DO HAVE

00:33:30.408 --> 00:33:32.043
SOME SOME QUESTIONS AND SOME

00:33:32.110 --> 00:33:34.412
CONCERNS- LET ME JUST START BY

00:33:34.479 --> 00:33:36.547
SAYING MY UNDERSTANDING IS

00:33:36.614 --> 00:33:37.982
THAT- THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE IS

00:33:38.049 --> 00:33:40.017
GOING TO BE DECIDED BY SEPT TWO

00:33:40.084 --> 00:33:40.852
SO IT'LL BE GOING TO THAT

00:33:40.918 --> 00:33:42.720
COMMITTEE- AND- WE'RE JUST.

00:33:42.787 --> 00:33:46.290
THIS DAYS SO I GUESS YOU CAN

00:33:46.357 --> 00:33:47.825
IGNORE EVERYTHING I SAY. I AM

00:33:47.892 --> 00:33:48.893
GOING TO VOTE ON THE COMMITTEE

00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:50.194
ON THE FULL COMMITTEE OF THE

00:33:50.261 --> 00:33:51.963
BUDGET. BUT BUT HERE'S MY

00:33:52.029 --> 00:33:53.898
CONCERN AND I I'M I SHARE SOME

00:33:53.965 --> 00:33:55.967
OF THE CONCERNS THAT THE- THE

00:33:56.033 --> 00:34:00.238
LA- HAS- HAS ARTICULATED. YOU

00:34:00.304 --> 00:34:01.406
KNOW TO A CERTAIN EXTENT I FEEL

00:34:01.472 --> 00:34:02.507
LIKE WE'RE RESEARCHING TO

00:34:02.573 --> 00:34:04.108
RESEARCH. AND WE'RE RESEARCHING

00:34:04.175 --> 00:34:06.944
SOME MORE AND- WEEK WE ALREADY

00:34:07.011 --> 00:34:10.481
KNOW WHAT WE NEED TO DO. AND

00:34:10.548 --> 00:34:14.018
PEOPLE OUT OF THEIR CARS. AND

00:34:14.085 --> 00:34:18.322
YET WE. SOMEHOW THINK THAT IF

00:34:18.389 --> 00:34:19.657
WE PUT HIM IN AN ELECTRIC CAR

00:34:19.724 --> 00:34:20.558
THAT TO BETTER THING THEM

00:34:20.625 --> 00:34:22.260
PUTTING A MINUTE GAS POWERED

00:34:22.326 --> 00:34:23.828
CAR WHICH IS YOU KNOW A GOOD

00:34:23.895 --> 00:34:25.830
STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION-

00:34:25.897 --> 00:34:27.432
BUT I'LL HARP ON SOMETHING I'VE

00:34:27.498 --> 00:34:29.167
BEEN HARPING ON FOR A REALLY

00:34:29.233 --> 00:34:31.269
LONG TIME IS UNTIL WE START-

00:34:31.335 --> 00:34:34.138
CREATING A ROBUST TRANSPORT BUT

00:34:34.205 --> 00:34:36.808
TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM. THAT

00:34:36.874 --> 00:34:39.777
EVERYBODY WANTS TO USE. NOT

00:34:39.844 --> 00:34:40.611
JUST POOR PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY

00:34:40.678 --> 00:34:43.114
HAVE NO CHOICE- THAT'S WHY WE

00:34:43.181 --> 00:34:46.117
SEE THE DECLINING. RIDERSHIP

00:34:46.184 --> 00:34:49.454
AND WE HAVEN'T. INCLUDED THE

00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:51.956
SUBURBS OR RURAL CALIFORNIA IN

00:34:52.023 --> 00:34:52.723
THAT TRANSPORTATION

00:34:52.790 --> 00:34:53.724
INFRASTRUCTURE SO AS A

00:34:53.791 --> 00:34:56.427
CONSEQUENCE- GETTING AROUND IS

00:34:56.494 --> 00:34:58.262
READ BY PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION

00:34:58.329 --> 00:34:59.464
IS REALLY HARD AND IN RURAL

00:34:59.530 --> 00:35:02.633
CALIFORNIA AND- PEOPLE PAY FOR

00:35:02.700 --> 00:35:04.735
REID'S AMONG THEIR FRIENDS READ

00:35:04.802 --> 00:35:05.503
YOU KNOW IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO

00:35:05.570 --> 00:35:07.472
GET SOMEWHERE SO. I'M SO

00:35:07.538 --> 00:35:09.807
THERE'S A COUPLE OF THINGS ONE

00:35:09.874 --> 00:35:12.176
IS THAT THE FIFTH CLIMATE

00:35:12.243 --> 00:35:14.946
ASSESSMENT. DOES NOT INCLUDE

00:35:15.012 --> 00:35:17.915
CDFA AND TO ME THAT'S A HUGE

00:35:17.982 --> 00:35:20.518
OVERSIGHT. BECAUSE IT'S A IT'S

00:35:20.585 --> 00:35:23.855
A- IT'S A DECISION THAT. DOES

00:35:23.921 --> 00:35:26.424
NOT RECOGNIZE. THAT OPEN SPACE

00:35:26.491 --> 00:35:28.125
IN AG LAND AND NOT JUST OPEN

00:35:28.192 --> 00:35:29.827
SPACE FOR OPEN SPACE BUT BE

00:35:29.894 --> 00:35:34.732
APPROPRIATE- AT. THE LAND

00:35:34.799 --> 00:35:36.868
MANAGEMENT OPPORTUNITIES THAT

00:35:36.934 --> 00:35:38.936
WE HAVE COULD HELP US TO SOLVE

00:35:39.003 --> 00:35:41.072
SOME OF OUR OUR AT GREENHOUSE

00:35:41.138 --> 00:35:44.642
GAS ISSUES AND I SAW A

00:35:44.709 --> 00:35:46.711
STATISTIC THEM I CAN FIGURE OUT

00:35:46.777 --> 00:35:48.746
WHAT REPORT CAME FROM BUT THAT

00:35:48.813 --> 00:35:50.948
WHEN YOU DO A CONVERSION OF AT

00:35:51.015 --> 00:35:53.784
OF AG LAND OR RANGE LAND TO AN

00:35:53.851 --> 00:35:57.788
URBANIZED USE. THAT IT. EIGHTY

00:35:57.855 --> 00:36:00.758
TIMES THE GREENHOUSE GASES AND

00:36:00.825 --> 00:36:02.827
SO THE MORE THAT WE CONTINUE TO

00:36:02.894 --> 00:36:06.097
KICK EM EXPAND OUR FOOTPRINT OF

00:36:06.163 --> 00:36:07.732
CONCRETE THAT THE MORE WE'RE

00:36:07.798 --> 00:36:09.400
GOING TO BE CREATING PROBLEMS

00:36:09.467 --> 00:36:11.469
AND THAT INCLUDES ROADWAYS BY

00:36:11.536 --> 00:36:12.503
THE WAY WHICH IS WHY I AM SUCH

00:36:12.570 --> 00:36:14.105
AN ADVOCATE FOR. PUBLIC TRANSIT

00:36:14.171 --> 00:36:16.107
TRANSPORTATION SO I THINK. I

00:36:16.173 --> 00:36:18.809
THINK THAT- THAT CDFA NEEDS TO

00:36:18.876 --> 00:36:20.778
BE PART OF THAT AND I MIGHT MY

00:36:20.845 --> 00:36:22.980
CAUTION. IN SOME OF THIS

00:36:23.047 --> 00:36:27.051
RESEARCH I'M AND THIS IS JUST-

00:36:27.118 --> 00:36:30.454
FROM MY PERSPECTIVE IS THAT.

00:36:30.521 --> 00:36:32.857
THERE ARE THAT THAT WE DON'T

00:36:32.924 --> 00:36:34.425
DECIDE WHAT THE SOLUTIONS ARE

00:36:34.492 --> 00:36:36.060
AHEAD OF TIME AND THEN ONLY

00:36:36.127 --> 00:36:37.929
STUDY THEM AND SAY WE'VE GOT TO

00:36:37.995 --> 00:36:39.730
DO THEM WE LOOK AT THE FULL

00:36:39.797 --> 00:36:44.068
RANGE OF ENERGY OPTIONS- AND-

00:36:44.135 --> 00:36:47.171
AND UP. COMBINATIONS OF THINGS

00:36:47.238 --> 00:36:48.873
THAT WE SHOULD BE DOING HAT

00:36:48.940 --> 00:36:50.041
WE'RE GOING TO ASK THE PUBLIC

00:36:50.107 --> 00:36:52.543
TO JOIN US IN I HAVE YOUNG KIDS

00:36:52.610 --> 00:36:54.245
NOW IT IS ASKING ME WHAT DO YOU

00:36:54.312 --> 00:36:57.648
DOING ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE AND-

00:36:57.715 --> 00:36:59.984
THE ANSWER TO THAT IS WHAT ARE

00:37:00.051 --> 00:37:01.419
WHAT ARE WE DOING RIGHT. DO YOU

00:37:01.485 --> 00:37:02.954
NEED A RIDE TO SCHOOL IN THE

00:37:03.020 --> 00:37:03.988
MORNING OR CAN YOU JUST WALK OR

00:37:04.055 --> 00:37:05.990
RIDE A BIKE THAT THE KINDS OF

00:37:06.057 --> 00:37:06.824
CHANGES WE'RE GOING TO ASK

00:37:06.891 --> 00:37:09.260
PEOPLE TO MAKE AND- YET WE

00:37:09.327 --> 00:37:11.195
DON'T HAVE ANYTHING. THAT

00:37:11.262 --> 00:37:16.167
INVOLVES AN EDUCATION PROCESS-

00:37:16.233 --> 00:37:19.036
FOR YOUNG PEOPLE THAT INCLUDES

00:37:19.103 --> 00:37:20.938
THEM IN THE DECISION MAKING.

00:37:21.005 --> 00:37:23.541
AGES IF YOU SPEND YOUR MONEY ON

00:37:23.608 --> 00:37:25.276
THIS IT'S GOING TO IT'S GOING

00:37:25.343 --> 00:37:27.011
TO CREATE MORE CLIMATE CHANGE-

00:37:27.078 --> 00:37:29.246
IF YOU'RE- THROWING YOUR TRASH

00:37:29.313 --> 00:37:31.115
OUTSIDE THE WINDOW IT'S A IT'S-

00:37:31.182 --> 00:37:32.717
IT'S GOING TO OUR DRAIN SYSTEMS

00:37:32.783 --> 00:37:34.118
INTO THE OCEAN IT'S- THOSE

00:37:34.185 --> 00:37:35.052
KINDS OF THINGS THAT TELL

00:37:35.119 --> 00:37:37.788
PEOPLE. YOU KNOW IT IT IT WE

00:37:37.855 --> 00:37:38.956
WOULDN'T HAVE TO RECYCLE SO

00:37:39.023 --> 00:37:40.324
MUCH PLASTIC PEOPLE DIDN'T USE

00:37:40.391 --> 00:37:44.595
PLASTIC RIGHT- SO I MY CONCERN

00:37:44.662 --> 00:37:48.599
IS JUST- I AM. I'M I'M

00:37:48.666 --> 00:37:50.935
INTERESTED IN IN MAKING SURE

00:37:51.002 --> 00:37:52.637
THAT AGRICULTURE IS AT THE

00:37:52.703 --> 00:37:57.074
TABLE- AND- AND THAT WE LOOK AT

00:37:57.141 --> 00:38:01.345
NATURAL GAS AS WELL AS- HYDRO

00:38:01.412 --> 00:38:04.482
AS WELL AS- YOU KNOW SOME OF

00:38:04.548 --> 00:38:06.384
THE OF A BIO MASS. EIGHT YOU

00:38:06.450 --> 00:38:07.585
KNOW THEY'RE THEY'RE THE

00:38:07.652 --> 00:38:09.487
TECHNOLOGY'S GOTTEN BETTER OVER

00:38:09.553 --> 00:38:11.689
TIME AND WE'VE WE'VE IGNORED IT

00:38:11.756 --> 00:38:13.991
AND SO I SAY THIS BECAUSE I

00:38:14.058 --> 00:38:15.059
HAVE HAD INTERNATIONAL

00:38:15.126 --> 00:38:17.361
VISITORS. AND I HAVE TRAVELED

00:38:17.428 --> 00:38:19.397
INTERNATIONALLY THIS YEAR. AND

00:38:19.463 --> 00:38:21.866
I'VE OTHER COUNTRIES THAT ARE

00:38:21.932 --> 00:38:24.201
VERY PROGRESSIVE. ARE USING ALL

00:38:24.268 --> 00:38:26.103
OF THE AT ALL OF THESE OPTIONS

00:38:26.170 --> 00:38:27.805
THE CALIFORNIA REFUSES TO

00:38:27.872 --> 00:38:29.707
BECAUSE WE HAVE THIS PUSH. THAT

00:38:29.774 --> 00:38:33.010
IT HAS TO BE IN YOU KNOW-

00:38:33.077 --> 00:38:34.712
ELECTRIC GENERATED BY SOLAR OR

00:38:34.779 --> 00:38:36.313
WIND AND THAT'S IT AND WE'RE

00:38:36.380 --> 00:38:37.915
LOSING AN OPPORTUNITY FOR

00:38:37.982 --> 00:38:40.785
ECONOMIC GROWTH IN RURAL

00:38:40.851 --> 00:38:43.287
CALIFORNIA SO I IT IF IT THAT

00:38:43.354 --> 00:38:45.189
NIGHT I HAVE SOME SERIOUS

00:38:45.256 --> 00:38:46.724
CONCERNS WITH HOW THIS IS LAID

00:38:46.791 --> 00:38:49.427
OUT IN ONE ONE. ONE FINAL

PROCESS HE'S IN THE

00:42:11.161 --> 00:42:13.197
DEVELOPMENT. BUT ALSO. AWARD ON

00:42:13.264 --> 00:42:14.531

YOU ASKED ABOUT. ARE THE VOICES

00:42:27.878 --> 00:42:29.780
THAT ARE NOT BEING HEARD. AND

00:42:29.847 --> 00:42:31.048
IN SOME CASES IT'S THE ROLE

00:42:31.115 --> 00:42:32.182
COMMUNITIES THAT WE'RE TALKING

00:42:32.249 --> 00:42:34.151
ABOUT- YOU ALSO SPOKE OF YOUNG

00:42:34.218 --> 00:42:36.086
PEOPLE WE HAVE A- FAIRLY ROBUST

00:42:36.153 --> 00:42:37.788
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM

00:42:37.855 --> 00:42:38.756
THAT WE RUN FOR THE CLIMATE

00:42:38.822 --> 00:42:40.190
CHANGE INVESTMENTS. AND A

00:42:40.257 --> 00:42:41.859
NUMBER OF DIFFERENT INITIATIVES

00:42:41.926 --> 00:42:43.761
THERE HAVE BEEN TACKLING THOSE

00:42:43.827 --> 00:42:44.995
QUESTIONS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL

00:42:45.062 --> 00:42:47.731
ABOUT ENGAGING ACT. NOT JUST ON

00:42:47.798 --> 00:42:49.633
PEOPLE WHOM FORMER PROCESS BUT

00:42:49.700 --> 00:42:51.468
DECISION MAKERS OFTEN IN THE

00:42:51.535 --> 00:42:52.970
WHITE. COMMUNITY SHOULD LOOK

00:42:53.037 --> 00:42:54.672
LIKE IN THE FUTURE AND SO I

00:42:54.738 --> 00:42:56.573
THINK. WE CAN BRING ALL OF THAT

00:42:56.640 --> 00:42:57.975
TO THE TABLE AS YOU SEE IN THIS

00:42:58.042 --> 00:42:59.743
PARTNERSHIP. AROUND CLIMATE

00:42:59.810 --> 00:43:02.046
CHANGE. AND IF I MAY ADD ONE

00:43:02.112 --> 00:43:03.914
MORE- FOLLOWING ON FROM THAT

00:43:03.981 --> 00:43:06.483
MAN ONE OF THE- THE PIECES THAT

00:43:06.550 --> 00:43:07.785
IS IN THIS PROPOSAL FOR THE

00:43:07.851 --> 00:43:09.019
ASSESSMENT WHICH IS DIFFERENT

00:43:09.086 --> 00:43:10.955
THAN OR IN ADDITION TO WHAT

00:43:11.021 --> 00:43:13.223
WAS- UNDER THROUGH THE PREVIOUS

00:43:13.290 --> 00:43:15.225
ASSESSMENTS. IS REALLY A ROBUST

00:43:15.292 --> 00:43:17.328
STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT PROCESS

00:43:17.394 --> 00:43:19.396
TO MAKE SURE WE'RE- PUTTING

00:43:19.463 --> 00:43:21.699
INVEST THE STATE'S INVESTMENT

00:43:21.765 --> 00:43:23.567
TOWARDS THE RESEARCH QUESTIONS

00:43:23.634 --> 00:43:25.369
AND TOWARDS THE ISSUES THAT ARE

00:43:25.436 --> 00:43:27.171
OF MOST NEED TO COMMUNITIES.

00:43:27.237 --> 00:43:29.707
NOT JUST AYE LOAD YOU KNOW

00:43:29.773 --> 00:43:31.675
IDEAS THAT COME THROUGH KIND OF

00:43:31.742 --> 00:43:34.812
AND AT. THE SAME PROCESS SO THE

00:43:34.878 --> 00:43:39.650
FUNDING AND SG SEE WOULD BE THE

00:43:39.717 --> 00:43:42.152
LEAD TO THE FOR THAT TYPE OF

00:43:42.219 --> 00:43:42.753
ENGAGEMENT FOR THE PAST NINE.

00:43:42.820 --> 00:43:46.323
WOULD BE A LOT OF. NEW LAID OUT

00:43:46.390 --> 00:43:51.895
AND TO MAKE SURE WHERE. DO IT.

00:43:51.962 --> 00:43:53.931
I AGREE SIR THE RIGHT IS WHERE

00:43:53.998 --> 00:43:59.303
THE PRESSING. WHITE THAT I AM.

00:43:59.370 --> 00:44:00.170
ON MY EXPERIENCE HOW SERVED

00:44:00.237 --> 00:44:01.505
SERVED ON THE STREET GROWTH A

00:44:01.572 --> 00:44:03.540
THAT OKAY ARE RAN SHOW. AND

00:44:03.607 --> 00:44:04.174
BECAUSE WE WERE CABINET MEMBERS

00:44:04.241 --> 00:44:05.943
HAD. THE BILL TO GO WAIT A

00:44:06.010 --> 00:44:06.744
MINUTE MAYBE WE SHOULD LOOK AT

00:44:06.810 --> 00:44:08.145
THIS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY

00:44:08.212 --> 00:44:10.047
SO- THE KEY IS TO HAVE THE

00:44:10.114 --> 00:44:12.349
INPUT. AND MAKE SURE EVERYBODY

00:44:12.416 --> 00:44:16.120
HAS A SEAT AT THE TABLE- AND SO

00:44:16.186 --> 00:44:16.687
I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT

00:44:16.754 --> 00:44:19.189
IT'S- WHEN WE TALK ABOUT

00:44:19.256 --> 00:44:21.658
HOUSING AND THE NEED FOR. THE

00:44:21.725 --> 00:44:23.827
AFFORDABLE HOUSING SUSTAINABLE

00:44:23.894 --> 00:44:25.896
GRANT PROGRAM THAT THAT. WAS

00:44:25.963 --> 00:44:27.431
VERY DIFFICULT TO HAVE RURAL

00:44:27.498 --> 00:44:29.233
COMMUNITIES INVOLVED BECAUSE OF

00:44:29.299 --> 00:44:30.768
THE WAY THAT THE METRICS ARE

00:44:30.834 --> 00:44:33.237
SET UP TO REDUCE THEM MAXIMUM

00:44:33.303 --> 00:44:35.272
AMOUNT OF GHG YOU'RE GONNA BE

00:44:35.339 --> 00:44:38.509
THAT'S THE BIG CITIES. AND SO I

00:44:38.575 --> 00:44:40.344
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE

00:44:40.411 --> 00:44:45.015
ARE OPPORTUNITIES FOR US. VERY

VACANCY RATE AND KIND OF WHY

01:11:40.529 --> 01:11:42.364
WE'RE HERE- I THINK IT'S

01:11:42.431 --> 01:11:43.532
IMPORTANT TO LOOK AT KIND OF

01:11:43.599 --> 01:11:45.034
THE RAPID GROWTH THAT IT

01:11:45.100 --> 01:11:46.101

01:11:46.168 --> 01:11:47.436
RELATIVELY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME

01:11:47.503 --> 01:11:48.971
SO IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THE

01:11:49.038 --> 01:11:50.406
FIVE YEAR. I'M GROWTH PERIOD WE

01:11:50.472 --> 01:11:52.241

01:11:53.942 --> 01:11:56.945
FINDING. OUT WE WENT FROM FIVE

01:11:57.012 --> 01:11:57.446
HUNDRED AND FIFTY EIGHT

01:11:57.513 --> 01:11:59.581
POSITIONS FIVE YEARS AGO TWO

01:11:59.648 --> 01:12:00.516
EIGHT HUNDRED AND FORTY TWO

01:12:00.582 --> 01:12:02.284
WHICH REPRESENTS A FIFTY. 51%

01:12:02.351 --> 01:12:05.154
INCREASE. JUST POSITIONS ALONE.

01:12:05.220 --> 01:12:07.923

01:12:07.990 --> 01:12:10.125
60% INCREASE 23% INCREASE WHEN

01:12:10.192 --> 01:12:12.761
UP 224% 4% SO THERE'S BEEN

01:12:12.828 --> 01:12:13.896
DRAMATIC INCREASES OVER THE

01:12:13.962 --> 01:12:15.898
LAST FIVE YEARS. BUT DURING

01:12:15.964 --> 01:12:17.900
THAT TIME OPPOSITE OPERATIONS

01:12:17.966 --> 01:12:19.635
ALSO. I WE WENT FOR ABOUT

01:12:19.702 --> 01:12:20.569

01:12:22.104 --> 01:12:23.672
ORGANIZATION THAT'S A HUNDRED

01:12:23.739 --> 01:12:25.207
THIRTY NINE DOLLARS- SO THAT

01:12:25.274 --> 01:12:27.576
REPRESENTS ABOUT A 75% INCREASE

01:12:27.643 --> 01:12:29.244
DURING THAT SAME PERIOD OF TIME.

01:12:29.311 --> 01:12:32.715

FROM NINE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY

01:12:38.754 --> 01:12:40.122
NINE MILLION. TO ONE POINT

01:12:40.189 --> 01:12:41.523
SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS. SO YOU

01:12:41.590 --> 01:12:42.591

BUDGET- WE WENT FROM ONE

01:12:44.326 --> 01:12:45.661

BILLION DOLLARS- WHICH

01:12:46.729 --> 01:12:48.764
REPRESENTS THE BOTTOM. SO 1%

01:12:48.831 --> 01:12:50.566
INCREASE WITHIN THAT PERIOD OF

01:12:50.632 --> 01:12:52.901
THE FIVE YEARS SO. I KIND OF

01:12:52.968 --> 01:12:53.769
PAINTS A PICTURE WHERE WE ARE

01:12:53.836 --> 01:12:54.703
AND WHILE WE'RE SITTING HERE

01:12:54.770 --> 01:12:56.505
TODAY- I LIKE TO MOVE OR TALK A

01:12:56.572 --> 01:12:58.006
LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE VACANCY

01:12:58.073 --> 01:13:00.142
RATE- I JUST WANTED TO INFORM.

01:13:00.209 --> 01:13:01.510
THE VACANCY RATE REALLY IS A

01:13:01.577 --> 01:13:02.978
FACTOR OF TWO THINGS IT'S HOW

01:13:03.045 --> 01:13:04.613
MANY POSITIONS YOU'RE HIRING.

01:13:04.680 --> 01:13:06.115
BUT IT ALSO INCLUDES HOW MANY

01:13:06.181 --> 01:13:06.682
POSITION YOU'RE LOSING FOR

01:13:06.749 --> 01:13:08.584
VARIOUS REASONS- THOSE REASONS

01:13:08.650 --> 01:13:10.753
COULD BE RETIREMENTS- DESKS

01:13:10.819 --> 01:13:12.187
UNFORTUNATELY HAD A FEW FOLKS

01:13:12.254 --> 01:13:13.889
PASSED AWAY THIS PAST YEAR-

01:13:13.956 --> 01:13:15.691
REJECTIONS ON PROBATION SO.

01:13:15.758 --> 01:13:17.159
LEFT STATE SERVICE OR LEFT NO

01:13:17.226 --> 01:13:19.128
DEPARTMENT EITHER FOR LATERAL

01:13:19.194 --> 01:13:20.996
OR PROMOTION. SO DOES INCLUDE

01:13:21.063 --> 01:13:23.198
THAT SO WE KEEP THAT IN MIND AS

01:13:23.265 --> 01:13:24.733
WE DO TALK ABOUT OUR VACANCY

01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:26.635
RATES. I'M TAKE A SNAPSHOT LAST

01:13:26.702 --> 01:13:29.738
TWO YEARS. AND IF YOU LOOK AT

01:13:29.805 --> 01:13:31.206
FEBRUARY OF TWO THOUSAND

01:13:31.273 --> 01:13:31.774
EIGHTEEN TO FIT EVERY OF TWO

01:13:31.840 --> 01:13:33.442
THOUSAND. MONEY ARE. REALLY

01:13:33.509 --> 01:13:37.379
FLUCTUATED EARLY ON AROUND JULY

01:13:37.446 --> 01:13:39.114
AND NUMBER TWO THOUSAND

01:13:39.181 --> 01:13:39.848
EIGHTEEN WE HAVE OVER 30% CAN

01:13:39.915 --> 01:13:41.016
SEE RAY. HAS CONSISTENTLY DONE

01:13:41.083 --> 01:13:45.854
NOW. BUT IF BACK TO DECEMBER OF

01:13:45.921 --> 01:13:46.955
THOUSAND EIGHT. AS TWO THOUSAND

01:13:47.022 --> 01:13:47.689
NINETEEN AVERAGE DROP ABOUT TWO

01:13:47.756 --> 01:13:49.358
FOUR HOURS. I'M WITH THE DRAW

01:13:49.424 --> 01:13:51.326
IN THE LAST SIX MONTHS AND CAN

01:13:51.393 --> 01:13:52.828
APPROVE THAT IF YOU LOOK AT OUR

01:13:52.895 --> 01:13:54.963
JANUARY TWENTY VACANCY RATE

01:13:55.030 --> 01:13:57.266
IT'S WE REPORTED. PERCENT

01:13:57.332 --> 01:13:59.668
DISAGREEMENT ON ALL TIME LOW-

01:13:59.735 --> 01:14:01.236
IF YOU LOOK AT FEBRUARY TWO

01:14:01.303 --> 01:14:04.406
THOUSAND AND TWENTY. 18% AND IF

01:14:04.473 --> 01:14:05.073
YOU LOOK AT THE STATEWIDE

01:14:05.140 --> 01:14:06.508
AVERAGE FOR OTHER DEPARTMENTS

01:14:06.575 --> 01:14:09.578
AS HOVERS AROUND- 12214% SO

01:14:09.645 --> 01:14:11.713
WE'RE GETTING REALLY CLOSE- TO

01:14:11.780 --> 01:14:13.081
WHAT I WOULD SAY THE STATEWIDE

01:14:13.148 --> 01:14:15.217
AVERAGE RATHER DEPARTMENTS- WE

01:14:15.284 --> 01:14:16.552

HUNDRED NINETY NEW POSITIONS.

01:14:19.922 --> 01:14:22.357
SO THAT'S ABOUT TWENTY FOUR NEW

01:14:22.424 --> 01:14:24.293
POSITIONS PER MONTH- THE

01:14:24.359 --> 01:14:25.627
CHALLENGE TO THE VACANCY RATE

01:14:25.694 --> 01:14:26.862
THOUGH AT THAT SAME TIME WE HAD

01:14:26.929 --> 01:14:28.597
ABOUT NINETY EIGHT POSITIONS

01:14:28.664 --> 01:14:29.998
THAT OUR OUR INDIVIDUALS THAT

01:14:30.065 --> 01:14:31.567
LEFT FOR VARIOUS REASONS. ALL

01:14:31.633 --> 01:14:33.235
THE VAST MAJORITY ABOUT 70%

01:14:33.302 --> 01:14:35.370
READ RETIREMENTS OR FOLKS AT

01:14:35.437 --> 01:14:35.971
LEFT FOR PROMOTIONS AND OTHER

01:14:36.038 --> 01:14:37.840
DEPARTMENTS SO WE KIND OF

01:14:37.906 --> 01:14:39.107
BOUNCE THAT OUT BUT WE DID LIKE

01:14:39.174 --> 01:14:40.442
I SAID A HARD A MASS AMOUNT

01:14:40.509 --> 01:14:41.610
ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND NINETY

01:14:41.677 --> 01:14:44.413
FOLKS BUT WE AVERAGE ABOUT

01:14:44.479 --> 01:14:44.980
TWENTY FOUR NEW POSITIONS A

01:14:45.047 --> 01:14:46.248
MONTH. SWITCH OVER THE LIMIT TO

01:14:46.315 --> 01:14:48.050
THE CHALLENGES FACED EARLIER ON

01:14:48.116 --> 01:14:49.818
WE'RE VERY A LITTLE UNIQUE FROM

01:14:49.885 --> 01:14:51.753
OTHER DEPARTMENTS. A ONE OF OUR

01:14:51.820 --> 01:14:54.223
CHALLENGES IS. A CHALLENGES AT

01:14:54.289 --> 01:14:55.624

01:14:55.691 --> 01:14:58.193
VACANCY RATE IS WE HAVE. 48% OF

01:14:58.260 --> 01:15:00.529
OUR POSITIONS DEPARTMENT WIDE.

01:15:00.596 --> 01:15:01.797
THAT WE CALLED DEPARTMENT

01:15:01.864 --> 01:15:03.398
SPECIFIC CLASSIFICATIONS IN

01:15:03.465 --> 01:15:04.700
OTHER WORDS THESE POSITIONS

01:15:04.766 --> 01:15:06.301
ONLY EXISTS OF HOUSING

01:15:06.368 --> 01:15:08.537
COMMITTEE DEVELOPMENT. AND SOME

01:15:08.604 --> 01:15:09.605
OF THE CHALLENGES THERE THE

01:15:09.671 --> 01:15:12.140
PERKS OF IT IS IT PAYS ABOUT 5%

01:15:12.207 --> 01:15:13.976
ON AVERAGE TO ITS COUNTERPART.

01:15:14.042 --> 01:15:15.244
I'M MORE MONEY THAN POSITIONS

01:15:15.310 --> 01:15:17.579
OF EQUAL ABOUT EQUAL TO JOBS

01:15:17.646 --> 01:15:19.147
BUT- DUTIES. FROM OTHER

01:15:19.214 --> 01:15:21.583
DEPARTMENTS. BUT IT ALSO

01:15:21.650 --> 01:15:23.619
REQUIRES HOUSING EXPERIENCE.

01:15:23.685 --> 01:15:24.186
AND BECAUSE OF THE HOUSING

01:15:24.253 --> 01:15:25.921
EXPERIENCE IS A LITTLE MORE

01:15:25.988 --> 01:15:27.556
CHALLENGING TO FIND FOLKS THAT

01:15:27.623 --> 01:15:28.891
CAN. QUALIFY FOR THOSE TYPES OF

01:15:28.957 --> 01:15:30.726
POSITIONS. I'M ANOTHER

01:15:30.792 --> 01:15:32.895
CHALLENGE IS WE'VE HAD-AN

01:15:32.961 --> 01:15:34.263
UNUSUAL AMOUNT OF TRYING TO

01:15:34.329 --> 01:15:37.466
PROMOTE. SO NOW AN INCREDIBLE

01:15:37.532 --> 01:15:39.067
SHOULDN'T MEANS IF I AM.

01:15:39.134 --> 01:15:40.836
AMERICA IF I'M GONNA CURRENT

01:15:40.903 --> 01:15:41.603
AND I FOR NEXT JOB I GET THE

01:15:41.670 --> 01:15:43.939
PROMOTE. AND WE STILL BACK FOR

01:15:44.006 --> 01:15:44.907
MY POSITION THAT. REALLY IMPACT

01:15:44.973 --> 01:15:47.676
THE VACANCY WE USUALLY A HEART

01:15:47.743 --> 01:15:49.778
A LARGE AMOUNT DEPARTMENT WIDE

01:15:49.845 --> 01:15:50.579
WE HAD ABOUT THIRTY NINE

01:15:50.646 --> 01:15:51.914
PERCENT. OF OUR OF OUR

01:15:51.980 --> 01:15:53.849
PROMOTIONS SO THAT TWO HUNDRED

01:15:53.916 --> 01:15:55.317
AND NINETY HUNDRED THIRTEEN OF

01:15:55.384 --> 01:15:56.885
ALL MORE INTERNAL PROMOTION

01:15:56.952 --> 01:15:58.086
THAT'S QUITE A BIT. SO ALTHOUGH

01:15:58.153 --> 01:16:00.289
WE'RE PROMOTING FOLKS IN PLACE

01:16:00.355 --> 01:16:00.856
WHICH IS ALWAYS A GOOD THING

01:16:00.923 --> 01:16:02.691
FOR STAFF. IT DOESN'T IMPACT OF

01:16:02.758 --> 01:16:05.093
A RATE AS YOU'D WANTED TO. THE

01:16:05.160 --> 01:16:06.061
OTHER PART AND IF YOU LOOK AT

01:16:06.128 --> 01:16:07.095
JENNIFER IS VERY DEPARTMENT OF

01:16:07.162 --> 01:16:08.263
FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE WHICH

01:16:08.330 --> 01:16:09.364
ACTUALLY ISSUES ARE GRANTS AND

01:16:09.431 --> 01:16:12.501
LOANS- THERE AT FORTY SEVEN

01:16:12.567 --> 01:16:13.969
PERCENT. OR INTERNAL PROMOTIONS

01:16:14.036 --> 01:16:14.536
SO THAT'S FIFTY FOUR PEOPLE

01:16:14.603 --> 01:16:16.438
THAT ACTUALLY WERE PROMOTED IN

01:16:16.505 --> 01:16:20.442
PLACE. ALTHOUGH THE KIND OF THE

01:16:20.509 --> 01:16:21.076
CHALLENGES WHEN YOU LOOK AT HER

01:16:21.143 --> 01:16:22.244
CONCERT. OKAY THE HOT PEOPLE

01:16:22.311 --> 01:16:23.745
ACTUALLY BRING AN END. BUT MORE

01:16:23.812 --> 01:16:25.781
POORLY LIKE TO. CHANGE ON SO

01:16:25.847 --> 01:16:27.616
WHAT'S CHANGED WILL BE DONE TO

01:16:27.683 --> 01:16:28.450
ACTUALLY REDUCE DRAKE IS HERE

01:16:28.517 --> 01:16:34.122
AND I WOULD LIKE TO. POINT OUT

01:16:34.189 --> 01:16:34.589
A FEW. ONE OF THEM IS

01:16:34.656 --> 01:16:36.692
CENTRALIZED OR HR FUNDS.

01:16:36.758 --> 01:16:37.259
BASICALLY WHAT THAT DOES IS

01:16:37.326 --> 01:16:37.926
THINGS ONE ALLOWS THE PROBE

01:16:37.993 --> 01:16:39.461
MANAGER TO FOCUS THEIR DATA.

01:16:39.528 --> 01:16:40.495
THERE'S A LOT LESS FOR THEM TO

01:16:40.562 --> 01:16:41.663
DO TODAY THAN IT WAS IN THE

01:16:41.730 --> 01:16:43.665
PAST- SO OUR HR SHOP IS NOW

01:16:43.732 --> 01:16:44.833
FULLY ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE

01:16:44.900 --> 01:16:47.102
RECRUITMENT PROCESS- DOES THAT

01:16:47.169 --> 01:16:48.403
IMPACTED APARTMENT YES- WE

01:16:48.470 --> 01:16:50.272
IMPLEMENT THIS A BACK IN. JULY

01:16:50.339 --> 01:16:51.707
OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN-

01:16:51.773 --> 01:16:53.575
BEFORE THAT THE YEAR BEFORE.

01:16:53.642 --> 01:16:55.444
THE AVERAGE TIME IT WOULD TAKE

01:16:55.510 --> 01:16:56.712
FOR RECRUITMENT AND RECRUITMENT

01:16:56.778 --> 01:16:57.713
STARTS FROM THE ORIGINAL POST

01:16:57.779 --> 01:16:59.481
DATE. THE DATE THE EMPLOYEE

01:16:59.548 --> 01:17:01.483
STARTS. WAS ABOUT A HUNDRED IN

01:17:01.550 --> 01:17:02.651
NINETEEN DAYS. SO EACH FOR

01:17:02.718 --> 01:17:04.553
EACH- RECRUITMENT TOOK ABOUT A

01:17:04.619 --> 01:17:05.954
HUNDRED IN NINEEEN DAYS BEFORE

01:17:06.021 --> 01:17:08.290
THE CENTRALIZATION. ST STE-

01:17:08.357 --> 01:17:10.058
JULY OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN

01:17:10.125 --> 01:17:11.593
WE REDUCE THAT TO SEVENTY FOUR

01:17:11.660 --> 01:17:13.395
DAYS. SO THAT'S ABOUT A 38%

01:17:13.462 --> 01:17:16.064
DECREASE. AND AS OUR HR SHOP.

01:17:16.131 --> 01:17:17.499
GETS MORE CUSTOM TO THAT I

01:17:17.566 --> 01:17:18.967
ANTICIPATE THAT PERCENTAGE EVEN

01:17:19.034 --> 01:17:20.802
DROPPING MORE. SO THAT WAS BEEN

01:17:20.869 --> 01:17:21.837
A BIG FACTOR TRYING TO GET

01:17:21.903 --> 01:17:23.472
FOLKS ON QUICKER IS THE AMOUNT

01:17:23.538 --> 01:17:25.807
OF TIME IT TAKES TO ACTUALLY

01:17:25.874 --> 01:17:26.742
RECRUIT A POSITION. ANOTHER BIG

01:17:26.808 --> 01:17:27.843
THING IS WE STREAMLINED OUR

01:17:27.909 --> 01:17:29.277
ONBOARDING PROCESS SO ONCE WE

01:17:29.344 --> 01:17:30.912
HAVE THE EMPLOYEE HARD HOW WE

01:17:30.979 --> 01:17:31.513
GET THEM ON BOARD AS FAST AS

01:17:31.580 --> 01:17:33.281
POSSIBLE. I'LL BE CREATED

01:17:33.348 --> 01:17:34.750
WHAT'S CALLED A ONE TOUCH

01:17:34.816 --> 01:17:37.085
PROCESS WHERE. BUT ONCE THE

01:17:37.152 --> 01:17:38.720
ONCE HR GETS A START DATE OF A

01:17:38.787 --> 01:17:40.889
NEW EMPLOYEE. EVERYTHING ELSE

01:17:40.956 --> 01:17:41.757
IS TAKING CARE OF SO IN OTHER

01:17:41.823 --> 01:17:43.492

EVERYTHING IS TAKEN CARE OF FOR

01:17:50.866 --> 01:17:52.634
THEM SO BY THE TIME THEY HIT.

01:17:52.701 --> 01:17:53.368
WHERE THEY ACTUALLY PHYSICALLY

01:17:53.435 --> 01:17:56.438

ALL THEIR SUPPLIES ARE READY TO

01:17:57.739 --> 01:18:00.242
GO. SO IT'S ALSO MUCH AMOS IT'S

01:18:00.308 --> 01:18:01.043
PRETTY IT'S PRETTY SELF

01:18:01.109 --> 01:18:03.512
SUFFICIENT- BUT IT ALSO GETS

01:18:03.578 --> 01:18:05.914
