FRONTS.

00:54:42.679 --> 00:54:44.948 region:rollup2
IN THE URBAN SLUMS AND THE SWEAT

00:54:44.148 --> 00:54:47.317 region:rollup2
SHOPS OF THE FACTORIES AND

00:54:44.948 --> 00:54:49.219 region:rollup2

IN THIS MOMENT IN OUR NATION'S

00:54:53.991 --> 00:54:57.227 region:rollup2
HISTORY.

00:54:55.793 --> 00:54:59.163 region:rollup2
AS HATEFUL RHETORIC SPEWS FROM

00:54:57.227 --> 00:55:01.298 region:rollup2
THE WHITE HOUSE.

00:54:59.163 --> 00:55:02.1000 region:rollup2
I HOPE THAT EVERY CHILD WOMAN

00:55:04.968 --> 00:55:09.206 region:rollup2
I AM SOMEBODY.

00:55:07.171 --> 00:55:11.375 region:rollup2

00:55:19.716 --> 00:55:22.820 region:rollup2
AS I LOOK AROUND THIS CHAMBER.

00:55:21.885 --> 00:55:24.788 region:rollup2
WE HAVEN'T MANY WAYS REACH THE

MOUNTAIN TOP.

00:55:24.788 --> 00:55:28.091 region:rollup2
AND OF CALIFORNIA.

00:55:26.757 --> 00:55:28.959 region:rollup2

REFLECT ON AN AMERICAN HERO WHO

00:55:52.382 --> 00:55:54.484 region:rollup2
WAS COMMITTED TO PROTECTING

00:55:53.183 --> 00:55:57.020 region:rollup2
CIVIL RIGHTS.

00:55:54.484 --> 00:55:58.722 region:rollup2
IN ACHIEVING EQUALITY.

00:55:57.020 --> 00:56:00.157 region:rollup2
THROUGHOUT THIS YEAR OUR NATION

HAS BEEN SUBJECT TO A RISE IN

00:56:00.157 --> 00:56:04.161 region:rollup2
DEPRESSIVE RHETORIC.

COUNTRY'S HIGHEST OFFICE.

00:56:08.565 --> 00:56:11.501 region:rollup2
WE WOULD BE WISE

00:56:10.500 --> 00:56:13.470 region:rollup2
TO CONSIDER THE TEACHINGS OF

00:56:11.501 --> 00:56:14.504 region:rollup2
RABBI HILLEL.

00:56:13.470 --> 00:56:17.241 region:rollup2
ONE OF JUDAISM'S MOST IMPORTANT

00:56:14.504 --> 00:56:17.808 region:rollup2

00:56:19.042 --> 00:56:23.280 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT QUESTIONS.

00:56:21.745 --> 00:56:25.716 region:rollup2
IF I AM NOT FOR MYSELF.

00:56:23.280 --> 00:56:27.050 region:rollup2
WHO WILL BE FOR ME?

00:56:25.716 --> 00:56:29.253 region:rollup2
IF I AM ONLY FOR MYSELF.

00:56:27.050 --> 00:56:30.120 region:rollup2
WHAT AM I?

00:56:29.253 --> 00:56:32.890 region:rollup2
IF NOT NOW.

00:56:30.120 --> 00:56:33.390 region:rollup2
WHEN.

00:56:32.890 --> 00:56:34.558 region:rollup2
DURING THE CIVIL RIGHTS

00:56:33.390 --> 00:56:36.793 region:rollup2

SPIRITUAL AUDACITY.

00:56:47.170 --> 00:56:50.240 region:rollup2
SIMILARLY OUR PRESENT MOMENT

00:56:48.772 --> 00:56:52.342 region:rollup2
REQUIRES MORAL GRANDEUR AND

00:56:50.240 --> 00:56:53.610 region:rollup2
SPIRITUAL AUDACITY.

00:56:52.342 --> 00:56:55.679 region:rollup2
IF WE ARE FOR OURSELVES

00:56:53.610 --> 00:56:57.381 region:rollup2

00:57:02.486 --> 00:57:05.489 region:rollup2
THE JEWISH COMMUNITY IN THE

THE LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS.

00:57:26.643 --> 00:57:30.147 region:rollup2
THE LATINO CAUCUS

00:57:28.445 --> 00:57:30.781 region:rollup2
I THINK IT IS ONLY BECAUSE OF

00:57:30.147 --> 00:57:31.915 region:rollup2
THE WORK OF SOMEONE LIKE DOCTOR

00:57:30.781 --> 00:57:33.650 region:rollup2

A PERSON WHO'S.

00:57:37.020 --> 00:57:41.224 region:rollup2
FAMILIES EMIGRATED FROM PLACES

00:57:39.323 --> 00:57:44.061 region:rollup2
LIKE PANAMA.

00:57:41.224 --> 00:57:45.762 region:rollup2
IN COLOMBIA IN JAMAICA.

00:57:44.061 --> 00:57:46.630 region:rollup2
WHOSE ANCESTORS WERE BROUGHT

00:57:45.762 --> 00:57:48.165 region:rollup2
HERE AS SLAVES

00:57:46.630 --> 00:57:50.767 region:rollup2
THE PLACES

00:57:48.165 --> 00:57:53.370 region:rollup2
LIKE MISSISSIPPI.

00:57:50.767 --> 00:57:54.871 region:rollup2
TO A MAN WHO PRACTICES JUDAISM.

00:57:53.370 --> 00:57:56.640 region:rollup2
IT IS BECAUSE OF THE WORK OF

00:57:54.871 --> 00:57:57.207 region:rollup2
DOCTOR KING. THAT I HAVE THE

00:57:56.640 --> 00:57:59.376 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY TO SERVE IN THIS

CHAMBER.

00:57:59.376 --> 00:58:02.346 region:rollup2
IF I HAD A MESSAGE TODAY I WOULD

00:58:00.811 --> 00:58:04.281 region:rollup2
I WOULD PARK IN THE WORDS OF

00:58:02.346 --> 00:58:05.983 region:rollup2
DOCTOR KING.

00:58:04.281 --> 00:58:08.952 region:rollup2
WHEN HE TALKED ABOUT THE FIERCE

00:58:05.983 --> 00:58:10.620 region:rollup2
URGENCY OF NOW.

00:58:08.952 --> 00:58:12.255 region:rollup2
HIS LEGACY LEAVES US WITH SO

00:58:10.620 --> 00:58:13.423 region:rollup2
MANY CONTRIBUTIONS

00:58:12.255 --> 00:58:15.492 region:rollup2

00:58:13.423 --> 00:58:17.894 region:rollup2
BETTER. IN GREATER. HIS MESSAGE

00:58:15.492 --> 00:58:19.663 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE ONENESS OF HUMANITY IS

00:58:17.894 --> 00:58:22.132 region:rollup2
A SPECIAL ONE AND HAS BEEN VERY

00:58:19.663 --> 00:58:24.001 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT FOR SO MANY OF US.

00:58:22.132 --> 00:58:26.069 region:rollup2
BUT YET WE CONTINUE IN THIS

00:58:24.001 --> 00:58:26.603 region:rollup2
PRESENT DAY.

00:58:26.069 --> 00:58:27.337 region:rollup2
TO SEE SO MANY REMNANTS OF

00:58:26.603 --> 00:58:28.839 region:rollup2

IN OUR COMMUNITIES

00:58:28.839 --> 00:58:33.110 region:rollup2
IN OUR SCHOOLS.

00:58:31.008 --> 00:58:33.777 region:rollup2
IN POLITICS.

00:58:33.110 --> 00:58:35.545 region:rollup2
YOU NEED ONLY TURN ON YOUR

00:58:33.777 --> 00:58:38.582 region:rollup2
TELEVISION.

00:58:35.545 --> 00:58:40.117 region:rollup2
TO HEAR COMMENTS BEING MADE.

00:58:38.582 --> 00:58:42.152 region:rollup2
BASED ON RACE AND ETHNICITY.

00:58:40.117 --> 00:58:44.287 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD DRIVE US APART.

00:58:42.152 --> 00:58:46.356 region:rollup2
THAT HAVE IMPACTED OUR FAMILIES

00:58:44.287 --> 00:58:48.325 region:rollup2
WHO EMIGRATE FROM ALL KINDS OF

00:58:46.356 --> 00:58:49.793 region:rollup2
PLACES LIKE OUR NEIGHBORS IN

MEXICO. OR ELSE SALVADOR.

00:58:49.793 --> 00:58:54.398 region:rollup2
OR HAITI.

00:58:52.562 --> 00:58:56.199 region:rollup2
THAT WE STILL SEE EVIDENCE OF

00:58:54.398 --> 00:58:57.934 region:rollup2
THE KU KLUX KLAN. IN THE NEO

00:58:56.199 --> 00:58:59.102 region:rollup2

FIRES US UP AND I BELIEVE IT'S

00:59:41.711 --> 00:59:45.082 region:rollup2
BECAUSE DOCTOR KING WAS A BIT OF

00:59:43.213 --> 00:59:46.349 region:rollup2
A SOCIAL ARSONIST?

00:59:45.082 --> 00:59:48.985 region:rollup2

01:00:30.794 --> 01:00:34.564 region:rollup2
SAY AND STAND FOR ACR ONE THIRTY

01:00:32.762 --> 01:00:35.899 region:rollup2
NINE.

01:00:34.564 --> 01:00:37.734 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT IN OUR

01:00:35.899 --> 01:00:40.070 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY THERE WERE PEOPLE WHO

01:00:37.734 --> 01:00:41.805 region:rollup2
WERE SOCIAL ARSONISTS WHO FOUGHT

01:00:40.070 --> 01:00:43.640 region:rollup2
FOR OUR COMMUNITIES AND I

01:00:41.805 --> 01:00:46.276 region:rollup2
BELIEVE DOCTOR KING NEEDS TO BE

01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:47.611 region:rollup2
RECOGNIZED FOR HIS HARD WORK.

01:00:46.276 --> 01:00:49.946 region:rollup2
I WANT TO SAY ONE LAST THING IF

01:00:47.611 --> 01:00:51.348 region:rollup2
I CAN'T.

01:00:49.946 --> 01:00:53.016 region:rollup2
WHAT HE FOUGHT FOR THAT

01:00:51.348 --> 01:00:55.652 region:rollup2
INEQUALITY WITH SEPARATE BUT

01:00:53.016 --> 01:00:57.020 region:rollup2
UNEQUAL THAT STILL OCCURS TODAY?

01:00:55.652 --> 01:00:59.089 region:rollup2
WE STILL HAVE PARTS OF OUR

01:00:57.020 --> 01:01:01.491 region:rollup2
SOCIETY WHICH ARE MARGINALIZED

01:00:59.089 --> 01:01:03.026 region:rollup2
WHICH ARE WITHIN. SHADOWS.

01:01:01.491 --> 01:01:05.295 region:rollup2
AND I THINK IT'S TIME FOR US TO

01:01:03.026 --> 01:01:06.329 region:rollup2
HAVE A LARGER DISCUSSION ABOUT

01:01:05.295 --> 01:01:07.931 region:rollup2
HOW WE DON'T LISTEN TO THE HATE

01:01:06.329 --> 01:01:09.166 region:rollup2
RHETORIC.

01:01:07.931 --> 01:01:11.134 region:rollup2
BUT LISTEN TO HIS LOVE AND

01:01:09.166 --> 01:01:12.569 region:rollup2
OPTIMISM THAT'S A MESSAGE THAT

01:01:11.134 --> 01:01:14.638 region:rollup2
WE AS A COMMUNITY NEED TO BE

01:01:12.569 --> 01:01:16.072 region:rollup2
LISTENING TO RIGHT NOW.

01:01:14.638 --> 01:01:17.874 region:rollup2
SO I THINK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS

01:01:16.072 --> 01:01:19.142 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT MEASURE FORWARD HE HAS

01:01:17.874 --> 01:01:20.744 region:rollup2
IMPACTED SO MANY OF OUR

01:01:19.142 --> 01:01:23.013 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES

FURTHER QUESTION A DEBATE ON THE

01:01:35.825 --> 01:01:39.029 region:rollup2
MEASURE.

01:01:37.894 --> 01:01:40.497 region:rollup2
SEEING AND HEARING ON DOCTOR

COMMENTS AS WE. DISCUSS THE

01:01:45.068 --> 01:01:50.040 region:rollup2
CELEBRATION OF DR MARTIN LUTHER

01:01:46.803 --> 01:01:51.207 region:rollup2
KING AND ACR ONE THIRTY NINE.

01:01:50.040 --> 01:01:52.809 region:rollup2
YEAH I WAS TRYING TO THINK OF

01:01:51.207 --> 01:01:54.444 region:rollup2
WHAT I WAS GONNA SAY TODAY TO.

01:01:52.809 --> 01:01:56.279 region:rollup2
CLOSE UP THE CELEBRATION.

01:01:54.444 --> 01:01:57.314 region:rollup2
THIS IS PROBABLY MY SIXTH TIME

01:01:56.279 --> 01:01:59.983 region:rollup2
SPEAKING ON THIS FLOOR

01:01:57.314 --> 01:02:01.117 region:rollup2
CONCERNING MARTIN LUTHER KING.

01:01:59.983 --> 01:02:02.285 region:rollup2
AND WHAT I THINK THE CAME TO ME

01:02:01.117 --> 01:02:03.787 region:rollup2
IS A REALIZATION THAT COME THIS

01:02:02.285 --> 01:02:06.022 region:rollup2
A PROBLEM THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN

01:02:03.787 --> 01:02:07.591 region:rollup2
FIFTY YEARS. SINCE DOCTOR MARTIN

01:02:06.022 --> 01:02:10.527 region:rollup2
LUTHER KING LIT THAT HE WAS

01:02:07.591 --> 01:02:11.394 region:rollup2
ASSASSINATED ON APRIL FOURTH.

01:02:10.527 --> 01:02:13.330 region:rollup2
NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT WHEN I WAS

01:02:11.394 --> 01:02:15.365 region:rollup2
A STUDENT AT UCLA.

01:02:13.330 --> 01:02:16.1000 region:rollup2
AND THEN I REALIZE THAT PROBABLY

01:02:15.365 --> 01:02:18.702 region:rollup2
IN THIS HOUSE MOST OF YOU NEVER

01:02:16.1000 --> 01:02:19.803 region:rollup2
HAD THE OPPORTUNITY.

01:02:18.702 --> 01:02:21.471 region:rollup2
TO REALLY SEE A LIVE

01:02:19.803 --> 01:02:23.907 region:rollup2
PRESENTATION.

01:02:21.471 --> 01:02:25.875 region:rollup2
AB DOCTOR KING.

01:02:23.907 --> 01:02:28.078 region:rollup2
MOST OF YOU NOT FIFTY YEARS OLD.

01:02:25.875 --> 01:02:29.179 region:rollup2
SO YOUR KNOWLEDGE OF HIM IS IS

01:02:28.078 --> 01:02:31.014 region:rollup2
IS KNOWLEDGE THAT HAS BEEN

01:02:29.179 --> 01:02:32.515 region:rollup2
TRANSFERRED DOWN FROM THOSE WHO

01:02:31.014 --> 01:02:34.551 region:rollup2
WOULD BEER OR BOOKS OR ARTICLES

01:02:32.515 --> 01:02:35.518 region:rollup2
IN NEWSPAPERS.

01:02:34.551 --> 01:02:37.120 region:rollup2
BUT I'M NOT SURE IF YOU REALLY

01:02:35.518 --> 01:02:39.055 region:rollup2
GRASS HOW DIFFICULT THE

01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:41.524 region:rollup2
CHALLENGE WAS.

01:02:39.055 --> 01:02:42.792 region:rollup2
IN HIS LIFETIME.

01:02:41.524 --> 01:02:45.195 region:rollup2
AS MOST OF YOU NO I WAS RAISED

01:02:42.792 --> 01:02:46.296 region:rollup2
IN I WAS BORN IN HOPE ARKANSAS

01:02:45.195 --> 01:02:48.031 region:rollup2
MY FAMILY IS STILL THERE MANY OF

01:02:46.296 --> 01:02:48.832 region:rollup2
THEM.

01:02:48.031 --> 01:02:50.667 region:rollup2
BUT WE'VE TRAVELLED THEY'RE

01:02:48.832 --> 01:02:52.035 region:rollup2
OFTEN SO I HAD THE UNIQUE

01:02:50.667 --> 01:02:53.837 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY OF LIVING IN

01:02:52.035 --> 01:02:54.571 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA WITH THE KINDS OF.

01:02:53.837 --> 01:02:56.106 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT WE THINK ARE

01:02:54.571 --> 01:02:57.407 region:rollup2
WONDERFUL AMENITIES IN TERMS OF

01:02:56.106 --> 01:02:59.109 region:rollup2
RACE RELATIONS IN COMPARISON TO

01:02:57.407 --> 01:02:59.943 region:rollup2
THE SOUTH.

01:02:59.109 --> 01:03:01.578 region:rollup2
BUT I TRAVEL TO THE SOUTH QUITE

01:02:59.943 --> 01:03:02.479 region:rollup2
OFTEN.

01:03:01.578 --> 01:03:04.180 region:rollup2
AND I SAW THE SIGNS OF WHITE IN

01:03:02.479 --> 01:03:05.682 region:rollup2
COLOR.

01:03:04.180 --> 01:03:07.250 region:rollup2
I UNDERSTOOD THE INCONVENIENCE

01:03:05.682 --> 01:03:09.486 region:rollup2
OF TRYING TO FIND A RESTROOM TO

01:03:07.250 --> 01:03:10.654 region:rollup2
USE AT A SERVICE STATION.

01:03:09.486 --> 01:03:12.022 region:rollup2
I KNEW WHAT IT WAS LIKE WITH TO

01:03:10.654 --> 01:03:13.423 region:rollup2
DRIVE FOR TWENTY FOUR HOURS AND

01:03:12.022 --> 01:03:14.958 region:rollup2
NOT BE ABLE TO STOP BECAUSE IT

01:03:13.423 --> 01:03:16.326 region:rollup2
WAS NO PLACE YOU COULD STOP TO

01:03:14.958 --> 01:03:17.394 region:rollup2
STAY. AND IF YOU STOPPED YOU

01:03:16.326 --> 01:03:19.562 region:rollup2
WERE AFRAID OF WHAT YOU MIGHT

01:03:17.394 --> 01:03:22.132 region:rollup2
SEE ONCE YOU LEFT CROSS OUT OF

01:03:19.562 --> 01:03:23.233 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA ACROSS THERE IS ONLY

01:03:22.132 --> 01:03:24.367 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU WOULD SEE WHEN

01:03:23.233 --> 01:03:25.669 region:rollup2
TO BREAK REACHED TEXAS. AND

01:03:24.367 --> 01:03:26.803 region:rollup2
BEYOND.

01:03:25.669 --> 01:03:28.071 region:rollup2
AND SO I UNDERSTAND SO MANY OF

01:03:26.803 --> 01:03:29.706 region:rollup2
US DON'T DON'T WE HAVE A SENSE

01:03:28.071 --> 01:03:30.740 region:rollup2
ABOUT IT.

01:03:29.706 --> 01:03:32.876 region:rollup2
BUT MAYBE NOT A SENSE OF HOW

01:03:30.740 --> 01:03:35.011 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT IT WAS AND HOW DEEP IT

01:03:32.876 --> 01:03:36.046 region:rollup2
WAS IN THE SOCIETY THE HATRED

01:03:35.011 --> 01:03:37.247 region:rollup2
THAT WAS THERE. BED BUILDING

01:03:36.046 --> 01:03:38.715 region:rollup2
BUILT UP OVER TWO HUNDRED YEARS

01:03:37.247 --> 01:03:40.617 region:rollup2
OF HATRED.

01:03:38.715 --> 01:03:43.119 region:rollup2
AND HOW THAT PERMEATED EVERY

01:03:40.617 --> 01:03:44.654 region:rollup2
ELEMENT OF A PERSON'S LIFE.

01:03:43.119 --> 01:03:45.922 region:rollup2
FINDING WHERE THEY WENT HOW THEY

01:03:44.654 --> 01:03:47.524 region:rollup2
LIVE WHERE THEY EIGHT WHERE THEY

01:03:45.922 --> 01:03:48.491 region:rollup2
STAYED.

01:03:47.524 --> 01:03:51.027 region:rollup2
HOW FAR THEY COULD GO AND NOT

01:03:48.491 --> 01:03:52.429 region:rollup2
GOAL A SOCIETY IN THE COMMUNITY?

01:03:51.027 --> 01:03:53.863 region:rollup2
AND THAT BECAME REALLY A

01:03:52.429 --> 01:03:55.899 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT THING TO TRANSFER

01:03:53.863 --> 01:03:57.200 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES TO YOUNG PEOPLE.

01:03:55.899 --> 01:04:00.170 region:rollup2
THE FACT THAT THIS BATTLE WERE

01:03:57.200 --> 01:04:02.038 region:rollup2
IN IS A BATTLE IS A LIFE BATTLE.

01:04:00.170 --> 01:04:04.474 region:rollup2
IT YOU CAN'T REALLY RELAX ON YOU

01:04:02.038 --> 01:04:05.975 region:rollup2
CAN'T GIVE UP ON BECAUSE IF TO

01:04:04.474 --> 01:04:07.677 region:rollup2
GO IT'S IT WAS DIFFICULT FOR

01:04:05.975 --> 01:04:09.379 region:rollup2
THEM CLIMBING THAT MOUNTAIN OF

01:04:07.677 --> 01:04:10.580 region:rollup2
DISCRIMINATION. TRYING TO GET TO

01:04:09.379 --> 01:04:11.715 region:rollup2
SOME FREEDOM IN SOME JUSTICE AT

01:04:10.580 --> 01:04:13.083 region:rollup2
THE TOP.

01:04:11.715 --> 01:04:14.718 region:rollup2
KNOWING THAT EVERY STEP WAS

01:04:13.083 --> 01:04:16.186 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT AND EVERY STEP MIGHT

01:04:14.718 --> 01:04:17.787 region:rollup2
MEAN YOUR LIFE.

01:04:16.186 --> 01:04:18.722 region:rollup2
AND BUT IT IS REAL EASY TO ROLL

01:04:17.787 --> 01:04:20.957 region:rollup2
DOWN THE HILL.

01:04:18.722 --> 01:04:21.725 region:rollup2
WITHOUT THINKING.

01:04:20.957 --> 01:04:23.360 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THE RACISM IN THIS

01:04:21.725 --> 01:04:25.695 region:rollup2
COUNTRY.

01:04:23.360 --> 01:04:26.262 region:rollup2
WAS BUILT UP OVER DECADES.

01:04:25.695 --> 01:04:27.030 region:rollup2
WHEN THE FIRST SLAVES WERE

01:04:26.262 --> 01:04:28.732 region:rollup2
BROUGHT HERE IN THE SIXTEEN

01:04:27.030 --> 01:04:30.266 region:rollup2
HUNDREDS.

01:04:28.732 --> 01:04:31.701 region:rollup2
THEY WOULD NOT NO ONE THOUGHT

01:04:30.266 --> 01:04:32.669 region:rollup2
THAT THERE WOULD BE THIS.

01:04:31.701 --> 01:04:34.838 region:rollup2
ENORMOUS SYSTEM OF

01:04:32.669 --> 01:04:36.639 region:rollup2
DISCRIMINATION.

01:04:34.838 --> 01:04:39.743 region:rollup2
AND HE WON AND LITTLE BY LITTLE

01:04:36.639 --> 01:04:41.444 region:rollup2
LAW BY LAW ATTITUDE BY ATTITUDE.

01:04:39.743 --> 01:04:42.011 region:rollup2
WE END UP WITH THE WORST SLAVE

01:04:41.444 --> 01:04:43.446 region:rollup2
SYSTEM IN THE HISTORY OF THE

01:04:42.011 --> 01:04:45.148 region:rollup2
WORLD.

01:04:43.446 --> 01:04:46.649 region:rollup2
ONE THAT WAS JUST NOT ABOUT AN

01:04:45.148 --> 01:04:48.585 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL BEING SINCE LATE BUT

01:04:46.649 --> 01:04:50.186 region:rollup2
GENERATIONS AND GENERATIONS AND

01:04:48.585 --> 01:04:52.055 region:rollup2
GENERATIONS OF PEOPLE WHO OWNED

01:04:50.186 --> 01:04:53.056 region:rollup2
BY OTHERS WITH THE RIGHT TO

01:04:52.055 --> 01:04:55.225 region:rollup2
ABUSE OF MACHINES IN ANY

01:04:53.056 --> 01:04:55.825 region:rollup2
CAPACITY THAT THEY THOUGHT.

01:04:55.225 --> 01:04:57.260 region:rollup2
AND SO THAT HAPPENED LITTLE BY

01:04:55.825 --> 01:04:58.461 region:rollup2
LITTLE.

01:04:57.260 --> 01:05:00.563 region:rollup2
AND SO WHEN EMANCIPATION

01:04:58.461 --> 01:05:02.699 region:rollup2
PROCLAMATION COMES IN IN

01:05:00.563 --> 01:05:05.034 region:rollup2
EIGHTEEN SIXTY THREE. AND THE

01:05:02.699 --> 01:05:05.668 region:rollup2
WAR ENDS IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY FIVE.

01:05:05.034 --> 01:05:06.236 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE A SENSE OF FREEDOM FOR

01:05:05.668 --> 01:05:08.004 region:rollup2
ABOUT.

01:05:06.236 --> 01:05:09.973 region:rollup2
FIFTEEN YEARS.

01:05:08.004 --> 01:05:11.508 region:rollup2
DOING RECONSTRUCTION.

01:05:09.973 --> 01:05:13.910 region:rollup2
AND THEN LITTLE BY LITTLE.

01:05:11.508 --> 01:05:16.279 region:rollup2
LAW BY LAW.

01:05:13.910 --> 01:05:17.647 region:rollup2
ATTITUDE BUT ADDED TO THAT BEGAN

01:05:16.279 --> 01:05:19.749 region:rollup2
TO CHANGE TO WE ENDED UP WITH

01:05:17.647 --> 01:05:21.451 region:rollup2
THE NEW SYSTEM CALLED JIM CROW.

01:05:19.749 --> 01:05:23.052 region:rollup2
AND I SAY THIS BECAUSE SOMETIMES

01:05:21.451 --> 01:05:24.854 region:rollup2
WE THINK PEOPLE RIDE INTO THESE

01:05:23.052 --> 01:05:26.256 region:rollup2
ISSUES YOU KNOW FULL FULL

01:05:24.854 --> 01:05:26.990 region:rollup2
FLEDGED WITH THE PROGRAM IN A

01:05:26.256 --> 01:05:28.291 region:rollup2
PROCESS THAT THEY CAN PUT OUT

01:05:26.990 --> 01:05:29.859 region:rollup2
THE.

01:05:28.291 --> 01:05:32.529 region:rollup2
WITHOUT REALIZING THAT STEP BY

01:05:29.859 --> 01:05:34.230 region:rollup2
STEP PIECE BY PIECE.

01:05:32.529 --> 01:05:36.199 region:rollup2
YOU BILL THIS IS THE SYSTEM OF

01:05:34.230 --> 01:05:38.168 region:rollup2
DISCRIMINATION AND HATRED.

01:05:36.199 --> 01:05:39.936 region:rollup2
AND SO I I RECOGNIZE THAT MANY

01:05:38.168 --> 01:05:41.438 region:rollup2
OF YOU WERE NOT A PART OF THAT

01:05:39.936 --> 01:05:42.672 region:rollup2
DIDN'T DON'T YOU GET IT BUT YOU

01:05:41.438 --> 01:05:44.040 region:rollup2
DON'T YOU'RE NOT YOU'RE NOT

01:05:42.672 --> 01:05:45.975 region:rollup2
EMPATHIZING WITH BECAUSE IT'S

01:05:44.040 --> 01:05:46.576 region:rollup2
NOT REALLY SOMETHING TO SOLVE

01:05:45.975 --> 01:05:47.477 region:rollup2
THE TO LIVE WITH THAT YOU WORK

01:05:46.576 --> 01:05:49.579 region:rollup2
WITH.

01:05:47.477 --> 01:05:51.314 region:rollup2
AND YOU KNOW HOW PROUD WE WERE

01:05:49.579 --> 01:05:53.316 region:rollup2
WOULDN'T WHEN WE SAW DOCTOR KING

01:05:51.314 --> 01:05:54.584 region:rollup2
AT A RALLY ARE MARKED.

01:05:53.316 --> 01:05:56.252 region:rollup2
AND HOW COURAGEOUS HE WAS WHEN

01:05:54.584 --> 01:05:57.720 region:rollup2
HE CAME TO SAN DIEGO AND EVEN

01:05:56.252 --> 01:05:58.221 region:rollup2
THE MINISTERS AND SAID IT WOULD

01:05:57.720 --> 01:05:59.322 region:rollup2
NOT LET HIM SPEAK AT THE

01:05:58.221 --> 01:06:00.056 region:rollup2
CHURCHES.

01:05:59.322 --> 01:06:02.125 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY WERE AFRAID OF

01:06:00.056 --> 01:06:03.393 region:rollup2
WHITE BACKLASH.

01:06:02.125 --> 01:06:04.394 region:rollup2
AND SO AS A RESULT HE TALKED HE

01:06:03.393 --> 01:06:05.628 region:rollup2
SPOKE AT SAN DIEGO STATE

01:06:04.394 --> 01:06:07.297 region:rollup2
UNIVERSITY IN THE JAIL BECAUSE

01:06:05.628 --> 01:06:08.731 region:rollup2
THEY WOULD NOT LET HIM SPEAK AT

01:06:07.297 --> 01:06:10.533 region:rollup2
THE LARGEST BLACK BAPTIST CHURCH

01:06:08.731 --> 01:06:11.835 region:rollup2
IN SAN DIEGO BECAUSE THEY WERE

01:06:10.533 --> 01:06:13.870 region:rollup2
AFRAID OF THIS RADICAL. WHO

01:06:11.835 --> 01:06:15.572 region:rollup2
MIGHT CAUSE TROUBLE WHO MAY MAKE

01:06:13.870 --> 01:06:17.574 region:rollup2
PROBLEMS A DIFFICULTY FOR THEM?

01:06:15.572 --> 01:06:19.876 region:rollup2
AND SO WHEN WHEN I BEGAN TO ASK

01:06:17.574 --> 01:06:20.410 region:rollup2
MYSELF AS WE LOOK AT THIS.

01:06:19.876 --> 01:06:22.679 region:rollup2
AND SAY YOU KNOW THERE'S A

01:06:20.410 --> 01:06:24.113 region:rollup2
GENERATION. THAT WILL DON'T YOU

01:06:22.679 --> 01:06:25.715 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE THAT EXPERIENCE

01:06:24.113 --> 01:06:27.183 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE THE KNOWLEDGE OF.

01:06:25.715 --> 01:06:29.152 region:rollup2
WHICH MAKES THIS DAY EVEN MORE

01:06:27.183 --> 01:06:30.520 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT.

01:06:29.152 --> 01:06:32.422 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WITHOUT THIS CELEBRATION

01:06:30.520 --> 01:06:33.990 region:rollup2
WITHOUT THIS DAY YOU COULD

01:06:32.422 --> 01:06:35.892 region:rollup2
AFFORD TO NOT EVEN THINK ABOUT

01:06:33.990 --> 01:06:36.426 region:rollup2
MARTIN LUTHER KING AND ALL THE

01:06:35.892 --> 01:06:38.061 region:rollup2
STRUGGLES THAT WE'VE BEEN

01:06:36.426 --> 01:06:39.262 region:rollup2
THROUGH.

01:06:38.061 --> 01:06:40.964 region:rollup2
AND IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT

01:06:39.262 --> 01:06:42.699 region:rollup2
BECAUSE AS WE'VE FACE THIS NEW

01:06:40.964 --> 01:06:43.800 region:rollup2
CHALLENGE WE ARE NOW FACED WITH

01:06:42.699 --> 01:06:46.102 region:rollup2
THE CHALLENGE THAT IS ENORMOUS

01:06:43.800 --> 01:06:47.070 region:rollup2
IN THIS NATION.

01:06:46.102 --> 01:06:48.905 region:rollup2
CHALLENGE TO TO BASICALLY BE

01:06:47.070 --> 01:06:51.007 region:rollup2
AMERICANS.

01:06:48.905 --> 01:06:51.975 region:rollup2
TO HOLD FAST TO THE VALUES AND

01:06:51.007 --> 01:06:53.843 region:rollup2
THE PRINCIPLES THAT WE BELIEVE

01:06:51.975 --> 01:06:55.678 region:rollup2
IN. THAT ARE UNDER ATTACK EVERY

01:06:53.843 --> 01:06:57.480 region:rollup2
DAY AS WE GET THE HATE MESSAGE

01:06:55.678 --> 01:06:57.981 region:rollup2
THAT SPEWS OUT AGAINST DIFFERENT

01:06:57.480 --> 01:06:59.716 region:rollup2
IMMIGRANTS IN DIFFERENT

01:06:57.981 --> 01:07:00.383 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS.

01:06:59.716 --> 01:07:03.186 region:rollup2
AND WHILE WE MIGHT BE ALL THAT

01:07:00.383 --> 01:07:04.787 region:rollup2
SOUTH NOT SO BAD BUT THE REALITY

01:07:03.186 --> 01:07:06.089 region:rollup2
YEARS. IT IS BAD.

01:07:04.787 --> 01:07:07.624 region:rollup2
IT GETS TO THE HEART OF WHAT

01:07:06.089 --> 01:07:09.659 region:rollup2
THIS NATION FOUGHT FOR AND WHAT

01:07:07.624 --> 01:07:11.861 region:rollup2
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE.

01:07:09.659 --> 01:07:13.630 region:rollup2
AND IT IS INDIVIDUALS LIKE US.

01:07:11.861 --> 01:07:15.031 region:rollup2
WHO DON'T MAKE STATEMENTS

01:07:13.630 --> 01:07:17.267 region:rollup2
WHO DON'T ROCK THE BOAT WHO

01:07:15.031 --> 01:07:19.068 region:rollup2
DON'T MOVE THE WATERS

01:07:17.267 --> 01:07:21.037 region:rollup2
QUIETLY SAY I DON'T AGREE WITH

01:07:19.068 --> 01:07:22.171 region:rollup2
YOU DON'T STAND UP AND SHOUT?

01:07:21.037 --> 01:07:23.840 region:rollup2
YOU DON'T STAND IN YOUR

01:07:22.171 --> 01:07:25.108 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES AND SAY STOP IT.

01:07:23.840 --> 01:07:27.143 region:rollup2
WE CANNOT HAVE THAT THAT IS NOT

01:07:25.108 --> 01:07:28.278 region:rollup2
WHO WE ARE.

01:07:27.143 --> 01:07:30.179 region:rollup2
AND SO PAYING OFTEN SAID IT'S

01:07:28.278 --> 01:07:31.214 region:rollup2
NOT THE WORDS OF MY ENEMIES THAT

01:07:30.179 --> 01:07:33.082 region:rollup2
BOTHER ME IT'S THE SILENCE OF MY

01:07:31.214 --> 01:07:34.884 region:rollup2
FRIENDS.

01:07:33.082 --> 01:07:36.586 region:rollup2
IT'S AFFECTED WE DON'T SPEAK UP.

01:07:34.884 --> 01:07:38.254 region:rollup2
WE DON'T SPEAK OUT WE DON'T

01:07:36.586 --> 01:07:40.323 region:rollup2
CONDEMN THOSE THINGS WHEN I SEE

01:07:38.254 --> 01:07:43.192 region:rollup2
WHAT'S ON TELEVISION NOW WHEN I

01:07:40.323 --> 01:07:44.494 region:rollup2
SEE CHARLOTTE VIOLA AND AND ALL

01:07:43.192 --> 01:07:46.629 region:rollup2
THE RIGHTS AND THEN PLOP RIGHT

01:07:44.494 --> 01:07:47.830 region:rollup2
NASH'S MOVE AND ALL THAT. I'M

01:07:46.629 --> 01:07:48.698 region:rollup2
WONDERING WHERE MY FRIENDS.

01:07:47.830 --> 01:07:50.199 region:rollup2
WELL MY COLLEAGUES WHO WANT TO

01:07:48.698 --> 01:07:51.501 region:rollup2
BE STANDING UP AND SHOUTING IN

01:07:50.199 --> 01:07:53.503 region:rollup2
STREAMING SCREAMING IN THE THE

01:07:51.501 --> 01:07:55.371 region:rollup2
TO THE TOP OF THE VOICE. BECAUSE

01:07:53.503 --> 01:07:57.807 region:rollup2
WE HAVE COME TOO FAR.

01:07:55.371 --> 01:07:58.908 region:rollup2
WHAT TOO LONG AND TOO HARD TO BE

01:07:57.807 --> 01:08:00.610 region:rollup2
PULLED BACK INTO THIS DARK THIS

01:07:58.908 --> 01:08:02.645 region:rollup2
OF HATE?

01:08:00.610 --> 01:08:04.080 region:rollup2
UGLINESS IN THIS NATION.

01:08:02.645 --> 01:08:06.015 region:rollup2
IF SO AS WE LOOK AT THE DOCTOR

01:08:04.080 --> 01:08:07.317 region:rollup2
KING DAY I AM HOPEFUL THAT

01:08:06.015 --> 01:08:10.420 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WILL BEGIN TO SEE

01:08:07.317 --> 01:08:12.388 region:rollup2
SOMETHING IN THEMSELVES.

01:08:10.420 --> 01:08:14.991 region:rollup2
THE CAUSES THEM TO RISE UP.

01:08:12.388 --> 01:08:16.859 region:rollup2
AND THE SAY NOT ON MY WATCH.

01:08:14.991 --> 01:08:18.428 region:rollup2
NOT WHILE I'M HERE.

01:08:16.859 --> 01:08:20.296 region:rollup2
NOT IN MY COMMUNITY NOT IN MY

01:08:18.428 --> 01:08:21.731 region:rollup2
NATION.

01:08:20.296 --> 01:08:23.666 region:rollup2
AND THAT BOTHERS ME MORE THAN

01:08:21.731 --> 01:08:25.234 region:rollup2
ANYTHING BECAUSE OFTENTIMES YOU

01:08:23.666 --> 01:08:26.869 region:rollup2
SEE THE THINGS THAT OCCUR.

01:08:25.234 --> 01:08:27.437 region:rollup2
BUT YOU ASKED THE QUESTION WHERE

01:08:26.869 --> 01:08:29.405 region:rollup2
ARE THE FOLKS WHO ONE FIGHT

01:08:27.437 --> 01:08:30.373 region:rollup2
AGAINST IT.

01:08:29.405 --> 01:08:32.842 region:rollup2
WHO DON'T BELIEVE IN IT BUT

01:08:30.373 --> 01:08:33.743 region:rollup2
WON'T OPEN THEIR MOUTHS?

01:08:32.842 --> 01:08:35.478 region:rollup2
AND THE BEAUTY OF THE MARTIN

01:08:33.743 --> 01:08:37.213 region:rollup2
LUTHER KING CELEBRATION DAY IS

01:08:35.478 --> 01:08:39.215 region:rollup2
THAT IT ONCE AGAIN REMINDS US.

01:08:37.213 --> 01:08:40.750 region:rollup2
THAT ONE PERSON.

01:08:39.215 --> 01:08:43.519 region:rollup2
STANDING FULL RIGHT.

01:08:40.750 --> 01:08:45.388 region:rollup2
CAN TRULY CHANGE THE WORLD.

01:08:43.519 --> 01:08:46.823 region:rollup2
ONE PERSON WITH A DETERMINATION

01:08:45.388 --> 01:08:48.725 region:rollup2
TO MOTIVATE OTHERS TO JOIN THEM

01:08:46.823 --> 01:08:50.026 region:rollup2
CAN CHANGE THE WORLD.

01:08:48.725 --> 01:08:50.693 region:rollup2
AND HE OFTEN SAID IF YOU DON'T

01:08:50.026 --> 01:08:51.995 region:rollup2
HAVE ANYTHING YOU'RE WILLING TO

01:08:50.693 --> 01:08:53.529 region:rollup2
DIE FOR YOU REALLY HAVE NOTHING

01:08:51.995 --> 01:08:54.864 region:rollup2
TO LIVE FOR.

01:08:53.529 --> 01:08:56.1000 region:rollup2
IF THESE PRINCIPLES THAT ARE

01:08:54.864 --> 01:08:58.801 region:rollup2
TRULY AMERICAN PRINCIPLE.

01:08:56.1000 --> 01:09:01.104 region:rollup2
HOW WE TREAT EACH OTHER?

01:08:58.801 --> 01:09:02.905 region:rollup2
HOW RESPECT THE VALUES THAT WE

01:09:01.104 --> 01:09:04.574 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAVE IN THIS NATION HOW

01:09:02.905 --> 01:09:07.010 region:rollup2
WE PROTECT OUR CHILDREN AND THE

01:09:04.574 --> 01:09:09.746 region:rollup2
LEGACY WE PASS ON TO THEM?

01:09:07.010 --> 01:09:11.948 region:rollup2
IS SO EXTREMELY IMPORTANT.

01:09:09.746 --> 01:09:13.750 region:rollup2
AND SO I CHALLENGE TODAY TO BE

01:09:11.948 --> 01:09:14.851 region:rollup2
THAT AMERICA AS AS THE BLOCK

01:09:13.750 --> 01:09:16.252 region:rollup2
PORT ONCE SAID THE NUMBER WAS

01:09:14.851 --> 01:09:18.621 region:rollup2
WOULD GET MUST BE.

01:09:16.252 --> 01:09:19.922 region:rollup2
THE THE THE NATION THAT HAS BEEN

01:09:18.621 --> 01:09:21.891 region:rollup2
THAT SAYS IT EMBRACES EVERYONE

01:09:19.922 --> 01:09:23.292 region:rollup2
BUT HAS YET TO DO IT.

01:09:21.891 --> 01:09:24.627 region:rollup2
BUT NATION THAT IS SUPPOSE TO

01:09:23.292 --> 01:09:26.596 region:rollup2
PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR

01:09:24.627 --> 01:09:27.797 region:rollup2
EVERYONE AND HAS NOT.

01:09:26.596 --> 01:09:28.631 region:rollup2
I CHALLENGE JUST TO BE THAT

01:09:27.797 --> 01:09:30.366 region:rollup2
NATION THAT WOULD THAT KING

01:09:28.631 --> 01:09:31.668 region:rollup2
TALKED ABOUT.

01:09:30.366 --> 01:09:32.635 region:rollup2
THE MOUNTAIN TOP EXPERIENCE THAT

01:09:31.668 --> 01:09:34.404 region:rollup2
HE COULD STAND AND SEE THE

01:09:32.635 --> 01:09:36.039 region:rollup2
PROMISED LAND.

01:09:34.404 --> 01:09:38.074 region:rollup2
BUT MANY OF US I HAVE BEGUN TO

01:09:36.039 --> 01:09:38.908 region:rollup2
WALK BACK DOWN THAT MOUNTAIN WHY

01:09:38.074 --> 01:09:39.375 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT'S LIKE IT'S A

01:09:38.908 --> 01:09:41.577 region:rollup2
FAMILIAR TRAIL AND IS

01:09:39.375 --> 01:09:43.279 region:rollup2
CONVENIENT.

01:09:41.577 --> 01:09:44.614 region:rollup2
AND IT IS HARD WORK TO BE FREE.

01:09:43.279 --> 01:09:46.349 region:rollup2
IT'S HARD WORK EVEN HARDER WORK

01:09:44.614 --> 01:09:47.750 region:rollup2
TO STAY FREE.

01:09:46.349 --> 01:09:48.718 region:rollup2
AND I CHALLENGE YOU TODAY TO

01:09:47.750 --> 01:09:50.720 region:rollup2
REMEMBER ALWAYS.

01:09:48.718 --> 01:09:51.287 region:rollup2
THAT HATRED.

01:09:50.720 --> 01:09:53.189 region:rollup2
IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE DON'T

01:09:51.287 --> 01:09:55.491 region:rollup2
WANT.

01:09:53.189 --> 01:09:57.427 region:rollup2
BUT JUSTICE EQUALITY OPPORTUNITY

01:09:55.491 --> 01:09:59.028 region:rollup2
IS A RARE FLOWER.

01:09:57.427 --> 01:10:00.897 region:rollup2
THAT REQUIRES CONSTANT TREATMENT

01:09:59.028 --> 01:10:03.499 region:rollup2
AND NURTURING AND CARE.

01:10:00.897 --> 01:10:05.401 region:rollup2
BUT HATRED IS WEAK.

01:10:03.499 --> 01:10:05.902 region:rollup2
AND IT GROWS BEST IN NEGLECT.

01:10:05.401 --> 01:10:08.171 region:rollup2
AND I ASKED TO NO LONGER

01:10:05.902 --> 01:10:09.405 region:rollup2
NEGLECT.

01:10:08.171 --> 01:10:10.506 region:rollup2
THE THINGS THAT ARE SO HORRIBLE.

01:10:09.405 --> 01:10:12.308 region:rollup2
THAT WE SPEAK OUT.

01:10:10.506 --> 01:10:13.443 region:rollup2
SPEAK UP.

01:10:12.308 --> 01:10:14.444 region:rollup2
AND WE BECOME THE PEOPLE THAT WE

01:10:13.443 --> 01:10:16.245 region:rollup2
BELIEVE WE ARE.

01:10:14.444 --> 01:10:16.913 region:rollup2
NOT JUST FOR US

01:10:16.245 --> 01:10:18.915 region:rollup2
BUT FOR GENERATIONS AND

01:10:16.913 --> 01:10:20.717 region:rollup2

01:14:45.181 --> 01:14:48.217 region:rollup2
AND WHAT HE SAYS IS WHAT'S

01:14:46.382 --> 01:14:50.152 region:rollup2

01:14:48.217 --> 01:14:52.321 region:rollup2

GROWING UP AND WHAT'S?

01:15:13.743 --> 01:15:15.244 region:rollup2
IS THAT WE WALK THROUGH THE
