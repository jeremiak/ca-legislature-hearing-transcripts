INFORMATIONAL HEARING TODAY ON THE TOPIC OF PLASTICS. IN OUR OCEANS. AND I WANT TO FIRST START BY EXTENDING MY THANK YOU AND MY MY GRATITUDE TO UNDERSTAND WHO'S. I HERE -- BUT HE'LL BE BACK IN IN HIS COMMITTEE STAFFERS WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH OUR COMMITTEE STAFF. I IN PUTTING TOGETHER THIS VERY IMPORTANT HEARING. WE ARE. LITERALLY SURROUNDED. BY PLUS I JUST EXTEND MY THANKS AND GRATITUDE TO YOU. ARCHER STERN AND WHEN WE GIVE MAKE SURE THAT HE'S GOT A SEE HERE AT THE FRONT -- ITSELF. OKAY WE'RE SURROUNDED BY PLASTIC IT'S AN ALMOST EVERYTHING THAT -- WHICH WE INTERACT. OFFERS BACK RIGHT HERE. FIRST INTRODUCED IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY PLASTIC QUICKLY GAINED POPULARITY BECAUSE OF IT'S DURABILITY ITS IT'S IT'S THE FACT IS LIGHT WEIGHT. THE FACT THAT CAN BE EASILY MOLDED INTO DIFFERENT SHAPES AND AND SIZES AND AND AND FIT ALL SORTS OF DIFFERENT PRODUCTS. AND SO -- BUT IT IS EVEN IN THE GRAND SCHEME OF HUMAN HISTORY OF RELATIVELY RECENT PHENOMENON. AND BY THE MID NINETEEN SIXTIES FIFTEEN MILLION TONS. OF PLASTIC WASTE WERE PRODUCED EVERY YEAR SO THE MID SIXTIES FIFTEEN MILLION TONS. NOW THE ANNUAL TOTAL IS NEARLY THIRTY TIMES GREATER WE'RE ALMOST AT FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION TIMES. AND THE SAD TRUTH IS THAT OUT OF ALL THE PLASTIC EVER CREATED ON PLANET EARTH ONLY 9%. I HAS BEEN RECYCLED 12% IS BEEN BURNED INCINERATED WHICH OF COURSE IS A VERY DANGEROUS THING. I GIVEN THE PRODUCTS IN PLASTIC. AND THEN THE REMAINING SEVENTY NINE PER IN OUR LANDFILLS IT'S IN OUR ENVIRONMENT. AS LITTER -- AND FORCING MUCH MORE OF IT IS ACTUALLY IN LITTER GLOBALLY AND THAN IN LANDFILLS -- IS ESTIMATED AT EIGHT MILLION METRIC TONS OF PLASTICS AND UP IN THE OCEANS EVERY YEAR. AND THE CONCERN IS THAT IF THE PRESENT TRENDS CONTINUE BY TWENTY FIFTY IT'S ESTIMATED THAT THERE WILL BE TWELVE BILLION METRIC TONS OF PLASTIC IN OUR LANDFILLS. ONE OF BIG CHALLENGES WHAT YOU KNOW WHY IS THIS A PROBLEM ONE OF THE BIG PROBLEMS IS OF COURSE THAT THAT DURABILITY THAT MAKES IT SO USEFUL. FOR THE PRODUCTS THAT WE HAVE -- A ALSO MAKES IT SO DIFFICULT FOR CLASSIC ABOUT A GREAT RIGHT IT IS VERY SLOWLY BREAKS DOWN INTO MICRO PLASTICS. WHICH ARE THEN INGESTED BY FISH AND OTHER MARINE ANIMALS. MICHAEL PLASTICS ARE FOUND ALL THROUGHOUT OUR OCEANS ARE FRESH WATER ECOSYSTEMS ARE SOIL OUR AIR. RECENT STUDIES OF ACTUALLY FOUNDED IN. BOTTLED WATER -- AND WE KNOW NOW THAT WE'RE ON TRACK TO HAVING MORE PLASTIC IN OUR OCEAN THAN FISH -- WITHIN WITHIN THE NEXT DECADE OR TWO NO WERE ALSO FAMILIAR WITH SOME OF THE MOST DRAMATIC IMAGES THAT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT TO US BY NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC AND OTHERS THERE IS THE FAMOUS. VIDEO OF THAT SEA TURTLE WITH A PLASTIC STRAW STUCK INTO ITS NOSE WE'VE SEEN PHOTOGRAPHS OF MARINE ANIMALS MISTAKING PLASTIC BAGS FOR JELLY FISH -- THERE WAS OF JUST A BEAUTIFUL BUT SERENE STRANGE. IMAGES THAT THEY CAME OUT FOR NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC IN THEIR SPECIAL ADDITION A CUP OF LAST YEAR. AND THE SLIDE THAT WE SEE HERE IS JUST THE LATEST THIS LITERALLY IS FROM YESTERDAY. OUR TWO DAYS AGO JUST THIS LAST FRIDAY THE PHILIPPINES BUREAU OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC RESOURCES FOUND A YOUNG WELL THAT WAS WEAK AND VOMITING BLOOD. THE ANIMAL PASSED WITHIN A FEW HOURS IN A THEY SAID WELL WHAT'S WHAT'S THE DEAL HERE WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THIS WELL THEY OPEN UP THE WHALE. AND IT WAS EXTRAORDINARY IN THIS ONE TO HAVE ALL THAT WAS SWIMMING OFF THE COAST THEY FOUND EIGHTY EIGHT POUNDS OF PLASTIC -- INCLUDING SIXTEEN RICE SACKS IN PLASTIC BAGS. SO YEAH THIS IS JUST A ONE LITTLE EXAMPLE THIS IS ONE LITTLE EXAMPLE OF THE PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE OUT IN OUR OCEANS RIGHT NOW. AND WE'RE GONNA BE LEARNING A LOT ABOUT THIS ISSUE WE'RE GONNA BE LEARNING ABOUT THE PLASTIC POLLUTION IN GENERAL WE'RE GONNA LEARN ABOUT WHAT CAN BE DONE WILL BE FIRST HEARING. WE HAVE SEVERAL PANELS THE FIRST PANEL I WILL BE GIVING IN IN -- OVERVIEW OF CLASSIC POLLUTION WE HAVE A DEBRA HOWEVER STATUS THE SECOND RECTOR OF THE OCEAN PROTECTION COUNCIL. AND DOCTOR CLEAR STEEL WITH THIS IS A PROFESSOR FOR FROM OUR CAL STATE CHANNEL ISLANDS CAMPUS THEN WE'RE GONNA BE HEARING FROM -- DOCTOR JEFF. POINT BONE BONE OKAY EXACTLY DIRECTOR OF THE MARINE MAMMAL CENTER -- WHO'S GOING TO BE DISCUSSING HOW PLASTIC POLLUTION AS AFFECTED OUR MARINE LIFE AND WILL ALSO BE HEARING FROM. MILLION CORD AND PROGRAM DIRECTOR OF UPSTREAM WE WILL BE TALKING ABOUT SOME OF THE SUCCESSFUL LOCAL EFFORTS THAT ARE OUT THERE ADDRESSING PLUS TO PLASTIC POLLUTION -- AND AND HER ORGANIZATIONS BEEN PART OF SO WE'LL BE LOOKING WILL BE STARTING WITH AN OVERVIEW THEN WE'LL BE LOOKING AT A LOCAL EFFORTS IN THE IMPACT ON RE WILDLIFE IT SHOULD IT SHOULD BE A A VERY INFORMATIVE AND AND I JUST HOPE IT'S GOING TO BE A GOOD. EXPERIENCE FOR ALL OF OUR MEMBERS TO THE GET ARE THEIR HEADS AROUND THIS IS VERY VERY SERIOUS PROBLEM THAT WE FACE AS A SOCIETY. AND WITH THAT I'D LOVE TO PASS THE MICROPHONE TO CENTER STERN AND SEE IF ANY DO YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR WHAT'S THE THE FAMOUS LINE IN THE GRADUATE BUT THE FUTURE. ALL RIGHT. ADVISING A YOUNG PERSON ABOUT. WHAT TO LOOK OFF SO HOW LITTLE WE KNEW? BACK THEN. OUR FUTURE I THINK IS GOING TO HAVE TO LOOK A LOT DIFFERET IF WE'RE GOING TO ACTUALLY. PUT OUR ECOSYSTEMS IN A PLACE TO SURVIVE -- I DON'T WANT TO BE THE LAST GENERATION. THAT. CAN SURF IN AN OCEAN THAT. AS LIFE IN IT -- THESE ARE TOUGH EXISTENTIAL THINGS TO GET YOUR HEAD AROUND. BUT THEY'RE HERE AND SO TODAY WILL BE SOBERING. IT'S A LIEU IT'S A LOT IT'LL BE A DOWNER POTENTIALLY FOR THOSE OF YOU HERE. I KNOW YOU LIVE IN THIS WORLD SO THINGS DO. FEEL OVERWHELMING AT TIMES IN TODAY'S REALLY GOING TO BE ABOUT SCOPING THIS PROBLEM AND REALLY JUST SOBERING UP. THEN REALIZING THE SCALE OF WILL GET A TAKE ON BUT I THINK YOU'RE INCREDIBLE SIDES HOPE. AROUND THE WORLD [inaudible] I THINK. OUR IT INNOVATION POWERS ARE IMMENSE. TO SOLVE THIS ISSUE. YOU SEE IN THE UK IN THE E. U.. INCREDIBLY DRAMATIC STEPS IT. MULTI A STATE LEVEL OCCURRING BUT ALSO ALL THE WAY DOWN. TO LITTLE CITIES. THEY JUST WANT. TO LET THEIR KIDS GO IN THE OCEAN AND ENDS AND HAVE SOME -- SOME SENSE THAT IT IT ACTUALLY IS A LIVE IN IT IS FEEDING US BECAUSE IT IT IS THE THE KEY TO THIS PLANET SURVIVAL AND THE WAY WE'RE TREATING IT RIGHT NOW IS IS TRULY AS A LANDFILL. SO I APPRECIATE BRING IN THIS -- THIS THIS SORT OF COASTAL UNITY HERE -- FOLKS LIKE TO MAKE FUN OF THE COASTAL REPRESENTATIVE IS IN THIS LEGISLATURE SOMETIMES AND SAY. YOU KNOW THIS IS AN EXCEPTIONAL IS THE ISSUE. THAT THE COAST IS -- SOMETHING THAT IS ONLY FOR THE EXCEPTIONAL FEW IN. WE KNOW THAT THE VISION IS THAT. THIS OCEAN IS CLOSEST FOR ALL IN CALIFORNIA BY LAW. AND HOPEFULLY BY OUR PRACTICES AND OUR FUNDING IN OUR PRIORITIES. BUT I I WOULDN'T I WOULDN'T HESITATE FOR ANY KID GROWING UP STAY IN THE ENTIRE SOUTH LAND. ROBIN I REALIZE WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENS WHEN YOU THROW SOMETHING AWAY. AND THINGS JUST DON'T GO AWAY. AND THAT'S WHAT TODAY'S ABOUT WHERE THEY GO SO THANK YOU. GIVEN MISTER CHAIR. AND IT'S TRUE YOU KNOW WITH THIS BECAUSE REALLY DOES TO FIND CALIFORNIANS SO MANY RESPECTS -- THOUGH I WILL SAY YOU BROUGHT UP THE U. I I NOTICE YOU JUST ARRIVE WE'RE ALSO GOING TO BE HEARING FROM THE CONSUL GENERAL -- TO SERVICE -- THE ENTIRE WEST COAST ON BEHALF OF THE GOVERNMENT OF AUSTRIA SO ANDREAS LONERS A GOOD FRIEND AND HE'S GOING TO BE BOB PRESENTING AT THE BEGINNING A PUBLIC COMMENT ON SOME OF THE FASCINATING WORK THAT'S HAPPENING IN EUROPE -- AND THE ZERO WASTE ACTIVITIES HAPPENING IN THE CITY OF VIENNA NOT A COASTAL COUNTRY. OF COURSE AUSTRIA A MOUNTAINOUS COUNTRY BUT ONE THAT I THINK HAS TAKEN ITS ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP RESPONSIBILITIES VERY SERIOUSLY. AND HAS SOME SAYS SOME INTERESTING LESSONS TO TEACH US ABOUT WHAT -- WHAT WHAT IS HAPPENING IN IN A VIBRANT CITY LIKE VIENNA ON THE ISSUE OF WASTE REDUCTION? AND SO WE'RE EXCITED TO HEAR FROM HIM AS WELL -- SO OTHER OTHER COMMENTS SERVE OR OPENING REMARKS MARK FROM MEMBERS CENTER MONEY. THANK YOU I JUST I JUST WANT TO THANK THE CO CHAIRS FOR CONVENING THIS I HADN'T PLANNED TO SAY ANYTHING BUT WHEN YOU MENTION THE SUBJECT MATTER POTENTIALLY BEING A DOWNER -- YESTERDAY WAS OCEAN DAY LOBBY DAY UP HERE. AND A YOUNG WOMAN FROM HOLLISTER IN SAN BENITO COUNTY SHELBY O'NEILL WAS HERE SHE HAS SPEARHEADED. AN EFFORT TO GET RID OF PLASTIC STRAWS IN THE POWER OF ONE PERSON ORGANIZING -- SHE'S SUCCEEDED IN MANY CITIES GETTING RID OF PLASTIC STRAWS -- AS WELL AS SUPPORTING LEGISLATION LAST YEAR THAT NOW REQUIRES YOU HAVE TO BE OFFERED A STRAW -- YOU HAVE TO REQUEST A STRONG -- THEY'RE NOT AUTOMATICALLY DISTRIBUTE WOMAN'S EFFORTS -- DELTA AIRLINES NO LONG NO LONGER. PROVIDES PLASTIC STRAWS ON THEIR FLIGHTS -- SO LITTLE BY LITTLE AND I KNOW WE'LL HEAR OTHER STORIES OF ACHIEVEMENT BUT THE DATA. IS OVERWHELMING THE REALITY PICTURES. BEACHES IN THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC COVERED WAY EVERYWHERE SET BRINGING IN [inaudible] PLASTIC SO. WE'RE KIND OF BEHIND THE CURVE I APPRECIATE YOUR CONVENING THIS AND IT'S UP TO US TO MAKE THE DIFFERENCE. THANK YOU VERY THE CHAIR AND I WERE TO SWAY YOU EVENT LAST NIGHT WHERE THEY HAD I COULDN'T HELP BUT NOTICE ALL THE STRAWS THAT THEY WERE USING WHERE WERE -- ENTIRELY BIODEGRADABLE AND IT DIDN'T DETRACT AT ALL FROM EVERYONE'S EXPERIENCE -- AND AND YOU KNOW. BUT BY DOING WHAT WHAT WITH THAT LEADERSHIP THAT YOU MENTION WE'RE NOW THE SWANKY WITHOUT YOU CAN BE TWENTY WITHOUT PLASTIC ALRIGHT THERE YOU GO OKAY SO LET'S -- LET'S START WITH OUR FIRST PANEL AND WE'RE GONNA BE TALKING ABOUT -- PLASTIC POLLUTION FIRST WE HAVE DEBRA HELPS OUT SO DEBORAH IS EXACTLY DIRECTOR OF OUR OCEAN PROTECTION COUNCILS HE'S ALSO DEBBIE SECRETARY FOR OCEANS. AND COASTAL PLANT A POLICY FOR THE NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY AT THE STATE. HE HAS EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE IN ENVIRONMENTAL ON POLICY SHE SPENT TEN YEARS AT THE OFFICE OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. LITIGATING CIVIL AND CRIMINAL CASES TO ENFORCE OUR ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS THAT I'M SURE SHE HAS A PAINS ABOUT THE LAST BILL WE JUST HEARD. I RECEIVED HER JD MOST IMPORTANTLY UC BERKELEY -- THE BEST LAW SCHOOL IN THE LAND. AND UNFORTUNATELY RECEIVED ABOUT OF ARTS OF STANFORD -- AND BEFORE LAW SCHOOL WOULD WORK FOR GOVERNOR GRAY DAVIS ACTUALLY HANDLING NATURAL RESOURCES IMPROPER TECHNIQUE RESOURCES ISSUES. FANTASTIC PERSON WE'RE LOOKING FOR TO YOUR TESTIMONY MS HARBORSIDE. THANK YOU SO MUCH CHAIRMAN ALLEN AND JACK CAM AND STERN FOR INVITING ME AND OLIVES AND THE SENATORS FOR HOSTING THIS VERY IMPORTANT TOPIC. AND I AM PLEASED TO BE HERE TO TALK ABOUT THIS GORGE OF PLASTICS IN OUR OCEANS TODAY. AND AGAIN I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA FOR PROTECTION COUNCIL OF YEAH LET ME GET THE SLIDE. CRITICISM OF THE THIS IS NOT MINE. YEAH YEAH. EXIT INSISTING -- YEAH THERE AGAIN. AN AGAIN I AM THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA OCEAN PROTECTION COUNSEL AND DEPUTY SECRETARY EVERY RESOURCES AGENCY FOR OCEAN AND COASTAL MATTERS. AN IMPENDING FOR THIS TALK I REFLECTED ON A AY I SPENT LAST YEAR AT COASTAL CLEANUP AND WITH MY FAMILY AND I WATCHED MY KIDS DIGGING THROUGH THE SAND LOOKING FOR THE LITTLE SHARDS OF GREEN OR RED PLASTIC PIECES AND PUTTING THEM IN THE POCKET. AND PULLING UP THOSE ARM LOADS OF WATER BOTTLES. AND I THOUGHT ABOUT HOW SIMILAR THEIR ACTIONS WORD TO YOUNG TURTLES WERE YOUNG SEA LIONS ARE YOUNG FISH. HUNTING. AND THE ONLY DIFFERENCE WAS MY KIDS WHEN I THAT PLASTIC. EVERY YEAR OUR SISTER AGENCY THE COASTAL COMMISSION HOSTS AND COASTAL CLEANUP DAY AND VOLUNTEER SPREAD OUT ACROSS THE BEACHES AND THE COAST. TO COLLECT TRASH AND THEY COLLECT OVER EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND POUNDS OF TRASH IN A SINGLE DAY. THIS IS A REALLY IMPRESSIVE ACCOMPLISHMENT [inaudible] UNFORTUNATELY EIGHTEEN BILLION POUNDS OF PLASTIC OR EIGHT MILLION METRIC TONS AND ENTER THE OCEAN EVERY YEAR. SO FROM HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF TONS OF GHOST FISHING GEAR DERELICT FISHING GEAR FLOATING OUT THERE. TO THE BILLIONS UPON BILLIONS OF TINY PIECES OF PLASTIC BETTER INGESTED BY EVERY LEVEL OF THE FOOD WEB FROM THE PLANK. TEN ALL THE WAY UP TO THE BLUE WHALES. ALL OF THE BOTTLES AND STRIDES AND CAPS AND RAPPERS AND LIVES IN BETWEEN WE ARE ILLING OUR OCEAN WITH PLASTIC [inaudible] AND YOUR OTHERS SPEAKERS THEY'RE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT THE SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS OF PLASTIC ON MARINE TO MARINE ECOSYSTEM ON HUMAN HEALTH. AND MARINE ANIMALS AND IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT PLASTIC POLLUTION IS VERY EXPENSIVE A CALIFORNIA LOCAL COMMUNITIES SPEND OVER FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. CLEANING UP IN CONTROLLING LITTER. MICHAEL THIS MORNING IS TO PROVIDE SOME CONTEXT AND SOME FRAMING. AND MAYBE A LITTLE HOPE I'M AROUND WHAT THE STATE IS DOING TO PROTECT TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM. I HAVE MISSED THAT PICTURE BUT HERE WE GOT. THEY AND LAST YEAR IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE CALIFORNIA OCEAN PROTECTION COUNCIL ADOPTED A NEW CALIFORNIA OCEAN LITTER STRATEGY PREVENTION STRATEGY AND THIS WAS A STRATEGY THAT WAS DEVELOPED THROUGH A VERY EXTENSIVE -- STAKEHOLDER DRIVEN PROCESS COLLABORATIVE -- THROUGH PUBLIC PARTICIPATION AND THE IDEA OF IT IS TO PROVIDE A ROADMAP FOR ACTIONS THE STATE AND OUR PARTNERS CAN TAKE TO ADDRESS PLASTIC POLLUTION IN THE OCEAN OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS. ON THE STRATEGY CONTAINS THREE PRIMARY PRIORITIES -- FOR PC THE FIRST IS TO DEAL REFER TO A SOURCE REDUCTION THE SECOND IS TO ADDRESS MICRO PLASTICS A MICROFIBER. AND THE THIRD IS TO ADDRESS DERELICT FISHING YEAR AND THERE ARE A VARIETY OF WAYS TO PREVENT LITTER FROM REACHING THE OCEAN AND THE STATE HAS REALLY SHOWN LEADERSHIP ON THIS TOPIC IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND SKI SEASON. TWENTY SIXTEEN AND THE VOTERS PASSED PROPOSITION SIXTY SEVEN WHICH BANNED SINGLE USE PLASTIC BAGS IN CALIFORNIA AND LAST YEAR MAJORITY LEADER CALDERON INTRODUCED AB -- EIGHTEEN EIGHTY FOUR WHICH AGAIN AND AS WAS MENTIONED EARLIER REQUIRES STRIDES TO BE -- PROVIDED AT SIT DOWN RESTAURANTS ONLY UPON REQUEST AND SENATOR ALLEN INTRODUCED THIS IS THE ANIMAL PACKAGING LEGISLATION WHICH REQUIRES AN ALL FOOD PACKAGING. IN CALIFORNIA STATE PARKS AND BEACHES AND OTHER STATE FACILITIES TO BE REUSABLE COMPOSTABLE OR RECYCLABLE. AT NEW PC WE'RE ALSO WORKING ON A VARIETY OF AND PROJECTS INCLUDING FOR EXAMPLE FINDING THE NEWPORT BAY TRASH WE'LL AND WHICH IS GOING TO BE TAKING. FLOATING TRASH AND DEBRIS IN SAN DIEGO CREEK BEFORE IT ENTERS THE UPPER NEWPORT BAY MARINE PROTECTED AREA AND GETTING THAT ALL THAT TRASH OUT OF THE WAY. AND THE PROJECT WAS BASED ON THE VERY SUCCESSFUL. BALTIMORE MR TRASH WE'LL AND WHO ACTUALLY REMOVES FIFTY THOUSAND POUNDS OF TRASH A DAY. AND I'M HAS THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF SOCIAL MEDIA FOLLOWERS I MEAN IT'S BEEN HUGELY SUCCESSFUL IN EDUCATING THE PUBLIC ABOUT THE IMPACTS OF TRASH AND WILD. WILDLIFE WATER QUALITY AND HELP REPLICATE THAT WITH OUR NEWPORT BAY TRASH WILL WE ALSO FUNDED A PROGRAM IN ALAMEDA -- TO HELP. RESTAURANTS REDUCE THEIR RELIANCE ON SINGLE USE PACKAGING SO WE WE AND CURRENTLY THE PROJECT HAS CERTIFIED FORTY SIX RESTAURANTS TO BE RE THINK DISPOSABLE. AND CUMULATIVELY JUST THE CHANGES MADE BY JUST TEN OF THOSE RESTAURANTS ATTACK ONLY TEN RESTAURANTS IN THE FORTY SIX PILOT RESTAURANTS. WE HAVE A LIMITED ONE POINT FOUR MILLION PIECES OF SINGLE USE DISPOSABLE FOOD WHERE PACKAGING EVERY YEAR. AND THEY'VE SAVED FORTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS EVERY YEAR SO THERE'S SOME REAL. AND PROJECTS YOU CAN DO ON THE GROUND TO GET TO THIS ISSUE -- LOCALLY BUT ALL OF OUR PROJECTS NEED TO BE THOUGHT ABOUT SCALABLE HOW ARE WE GOING. TO BRING THIS UP TO THE STATE LEVEL AND AND HAVE AS SIGNIFICANT AN IMPACT AS WE CAN. IN TERMS OF MICRO PLASTICS AND THIS IS THE SECOND PRONG OF OUR PLASTIC STRATEGY AND SENATOR PORTANTINO LAST YEAR INTRODUCED SB TWELVE SIXTY THREE WHICH REQUIRES -- PC TO DEVELOP A COMPREHENSIVE MICRO PLASTIC STRATEGY SO WE ARE. WORKING WITH SCIENTISTS FROM AROUND THE WORLD SCALE AND THE IMPACT OF MICRO PLASTICS ON CALIFORNIA'S ENVIRONMENT AND OUR MARINE ECOSYSTEM AND THEN TO DEVELOP SOLUTIONS TO ADDRESS A MICRO POSIT POLLUTION. AND FINALLY WE'RE WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE AND THE CALIFORNIA FISH AND GAME COMMISSION. TO ENHANCE AND BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES TO PREVENT AND RECOVER AND LOST OR ABANDONED FISHING GEAR AND AQUACULTURE HERE. WE DO NOT WORK ALONE OF COURSE THAT -- PC PART OF OUR MISSION ACTUALLY IS TO COORDINATE WITH OUR PARTNER WITH OUR SISTER AGENCIES -- TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE BEING AFFECT AS EFFECTIVE AS POSSIBLE AND THAT OUR EFFORTS ARE COMPLIMENTING AND NOT DUPLICATING ONE ANOTHER. AND SO CALIFORNIA COASTAL CLEANUP DAY AS I MENTIONED EARLIER IS SPONSORED BY THE CALIFORNIA COASTAL COMMISSION THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST WELL KNOWN EFFORTS AND TO ADDRESS PLASTIC POLLUTION IT WAS STARTED IN. NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE AND IT'S THE LARGEST AS VOLUNTEER EVENT IN THE STATE. THE THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD HAS ADOPTED TRACK WITH PEOPLE COMMON THE TRASH AMENDMENTS AND WHICH PROHIBITS STORM WATER SYSTEMS FROM DISCHARGING TRASH LARGER THAN FIVE MILLIMETERS SO BASICALLY ANYTHING THAT'S NON. MICROPROCESSOR INTO STATE WATERS -- INTO COMPLY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE NOW EITHER PURCHASING AND INSTALLING FULL CAPTURE SYSTEM TO CATCH THE TRASH IN THEIR STORM DRAINS BEFORE IT GOES OUT INTO THE OCEAN OR THEY'RE PAYING FOR OTHER EQUIVALENT MEASURES. THAT WOULD AND YOU COULD WIN TO INSTALLING THESE KINDS OF FULL CAPTURE SYSTEMS WE'VE BEEN WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE WATER BOARD ON THEIR EFFORTS IN THIS REGARD. ON THE CHEMISTRY SIDE OF THINGS THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TOXIC SUBSTANCES CONTROL RUNS THE SAFER CONSUMER PRODUCTS PROGRAM WHICH IDENTIFIES AND EVALUATES AM. CAN'T CHEMICALS OF CONCERN IN CONSUMER PRODUCTS AND STAKEHOLDERS THAT WORK ON PLASTIC POLLUTION HAVE REYES THIS CONCERN. THAT CHEMICAL ADDITIVES IN SINGLE USER LAKE FLORENTINO COMPOUNDS AND PHTHALATES ARE NOW ESCAPING INTO THE ENVIRONMENT THROUGH THE PLASTIC WASTE. I'M SO IN RESPONSE TO REQUESTS FROM THE PUBLIC THE SAFER CONSUMER PRODUCTS PROGRAM HAS INCLUDED FAST FOOD PACKAGING. IN THEIR TWENTY EIGHTEEN TWENTY TWENTY PRIORITY PRODUCT WORK PLAN. I'M AND FINALLY OPC HAS BEEN COORDINATING EXTENSIVELY WITH POWER CYCLE AND SINCE TWENTY TWELVE ON ITS PACKAGING POLICIES AND MOST RECENTLY WE'VE BEEN COORDINATING BOTH ON AND SB THIRTEEN THIRTY FIVE AND THINKING THROUGH HOW TO IMPLEMENT -- THAT VERY IMPORTANT LEGISLATION PROHIBITING FOODS. A FOOD SERVICE FACILITIES IN STATE BUILDINGS FROM USING AND PACKAGING THAT'S NOT REUSABLE RECYCLABLE OR COMPOSTABLE AND WE'RE ALSO COORDINATING WITH CHARISMATIC ON THEIR PILOT. RE USE PROGRAM WHICH WOULD PROVIDE GRANTS AND FOR PROJECTS TO PROMOTE THE RE USE OF PRODUCTS THAT WE AVOID THE SINGLE USE AN AB CYCLE THAT WE'VE GOTTEN OURSELVES INTO YOU. SO IN CONCLUSION I AM I WOULD JUST REMIND EVERYONE MARINE TO READ TO LOSE OUR BEACHES THAT CREATES A HAZARD FOR HUMANS IT IN TANGLES AND IT POISONS WILDLIFE. IT EMPLOYS IS HUGE COSTS ON LOCAL MUNICIPALITIES THROUGH COLLECTION EFFORTS AND LOST TOURISM REVENUE. AND AND WE HAD A PC ARE COMMITTED TO CONTINUE TO COORDINATE EFFORTS TO REDUCE MARINE DEBRIS AND WE WILL LEAD COLLABORATIVE PARTNERSHIPS WILL SUPPORT IMPLEMENTATION OF RECOMMENDATIONS. WE WILL FIND A TARGETED STUDIES TO INFORM MANAGEMENT AND WE WILL SHARE INFORMATION WITH DECISION MAKERS INCLUDING ALL OF YOURSELF SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH. OF THE ME BY THE BY THE WAY TO GO JUST A QUICK MOMENT MOMENT OF PERSONAL PRIVILEGE I SEE A COUPLE YOUNG PEOPLE FROM MY DISTRICT YOU'RE HERE WAS PART OF THE HOUSE FOR IS CAPITAL CONVOY. AND FANTASTIC YOUNG PEOPLE I SPOKE TO THEM LAST NIGHT AND EVERYTHING THEY WANT -- TO POLLUTION ISSUE SO IT'S THE WORLD THAT WE'RE IN WE'RE GIVING TO THEM THAT THAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT TODAY SO -- GLAD TO GLAD TO SEE YOU GUYS HERE. I'M SORRY SECOND SPEAKER IS DOCTOR CLEAR STEEL MINUTES IT IS IS AN ASSISTANT. PROFESSOR OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AT CAL STATE CHANNEL ISLANDS AND SHE'S AN APPLIED MARINE ECOLOGIST A CONSERVATION BIOLOGIST SHE'S GOT EXTENSIVE. EXPERIENCE IN THIS AREA WITH MORNING COASTAL ENVIRONMENTS IN HER RESEARCH EXAMINES HUMAN IMPACTS. ON COASTAL SYSTEMS AND SHE ASSESSES NATURAL RESOURCES. I HAD TO HOW IT INFORMS COASTAL MANAGEMENT AND HER CURRENT RESEARCH I THINK FOCUSES ON THE ECOLOGICAL IMPACTS OF OCEAN LITTERING MICRO PLASTIC. DEBRIS ON OUR COASTAL. ECOSYSTEM SO SHE'S GOT A PHD FROM UNIVERSITY OF RHODE ISLAND AND NATURAL RESOURCES SCIENCE OR MASTERS IS FROM TROPICAL COASTAL MANAGEMENT. FROM NEWCASTLE UNIVERSITY AND HER BATCHES SCIENCES IN BIOLOGY FROM UNIVERSITY OF YORK SO WE'VE GOT TO GET BRITISH. BACKGROUND AS WELL SO I LOVE THAT AND WE WELCOME YOU DEBRA I'M SORRY WE WE WELCOME YOU CLEAR. FOR FOR THIS PRESENTATION THANK YOU AND THANK YOU CHAIRMAN ALAN AND CHAIRMAN STERN INTO THE SENATE IS FOR YOUR INTEREST SO I ALONG WITH. OTHERS IN THIS AT CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM ALONG AS WITH RESEARCHERS AROUND THE WORLD CITY -- THE IMPACT OF MICRO PLASTICS IN THE MARINE ENVIRONMENT. AND THIS IS AN AREA OF GROWING AN INCREASE IN THE ACTIVE AREA OF RESEARCH -- OVER ABOUT THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS SO WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AND READ ANTI WHAT MICROPLATE SIX IT'S GENERALLY CONSIDERED. TO BE PLASTIC PARTICLES AND FIBERS THAT ARE LESS THAN FIVE MILLIMETERS DOWN TO ABOUT ONE MICRON -- AND SO FOR REFERENCE -- ABOUT SEVENTY MY FRIENDS IS THE WITH HUMAN HAIR SO THESE ARE SMALL PARTICLES THAT MAY BE MANUFACTURED TO BE SMALL AS IN PRIMARY MARK PLASTICS LIKE MICROBEADS -- OR THE THE RAW -- PALLETS OF PLASTIC LIKE MINERALS -- THERE'S ALSO SECONDARY MICHAEL PLASTIC TO TO FORM FROM THE FRAGMENTATION OF LARGER ITEMS -- THIS SEEMS TO HAPPEN PARTICULAR ON BEACHES WHERE THERE'S HIGH UV IRRADIATION A LOT OF ABRASION THAT CAUSES LARGER ITEMS TO BREAK DOWN -- IT ALSO OCCURS IS THAT ARE DURING OF CLOTHING AND ALSO HAVE IS FROM AERIAL THE POSITION OF THINGS LIKE TIRE DUST. AND YOU KNOW FLOATING FIBERS FROM INDUSTRIAL CARPETING AND SUCH DO YOU CAME UP WITH THE TERM NURGLE -- AT THIS IN A LETTER AND THE THE INTERNAL IS THE ROB. THE MUPPET PALETTE YEAH. OKAY. SO -- THERE'S A WHOLE VARIETY OF OF MATERIALS THAT ARE MANUFACTURE EVERY YEAR A HUGE RANGE OF PLASTICS WITH DIFFERENT COMPOSITIONS THAT ARE MANUFACTURED. AND ALONG WITH THE PLASTICS THEMSELVES THERE ARE A VARIETY OF CHEMICALS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THEM INCLUDING ADDITIVES THAT ARE USED -- TO PRODUCE PARTICULAR CHARACTERISTICS IN PLASTIC LIKE PLASTICIZERS PHTHALATES ANTI STATIC AGENTS I'M SO THERE'S A ARE. CHEMICALS THAT ARE MANUFACTURED -- INTO THE PLASTIC BUT THEN IN THE ENVIRONMENT. CERTAIN CHEMICALS THINGS LIKE PC BEES DDT'S CLUB BROMINATED FLAME RETARDANTS TEND HAVE THIS AFFINITY WHERE THEY WANNA STICK ON TO THE SURFACE OF PLASTICS -- AND SO IT'S NOT ONLY THE CONCERNED ABOUT PLASTICS IN A MARMON IT'S ALSO ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMICALS THAT MAY BE I'M ASSOCIATED WITH THEM AND THESE ARE CONSIDERED PRIORITY CONTAMINANTS BY GAMMA GOVERNMENTS. BECAUSE THEIR PERSISTENT BY ACCUMULATIVE AND OR TOXIC. MICHAEL PLASTICS ARE LIKELY THE MOST OF NUMERICALLY ABUNDANT ITEMS OF PLASTIC IN THE OCEAN TODAY AND THE QUANTITIES OF MICHAEL PLASTICS ARE INEVITABLY GOING TO INCREASE IN LARGE. PART BECAUSE OF LARGER PLASTIC RATING AND BREAKING UP INTO MILLIONS OF MICRO PLASTIC PIECES. AROUND THE GLOBE BUOYANT MICHAEL PLASTICS ARE CONCENTRATED IN MID OCEANIC GYRES SO CENTERS OF CIRCULATION LIKE THE GREAT PACIFIC GARBAGE PATCH I'M ALSO AROUND CENTERS OF CIRCULATION -- RECENT STUDIES HAVE ESTIMATED. THE NUMBER OF MY PLASTIC PARTICLES FLOATING ON THE SERVICE TO BE SOMETHING BETWEEN FIFTEEN TO FIFTY ONE TRILLION PARTICLES. BUT WE SHOULD BE AWARE THAT NOT ALL MANUFACTURED PLASTICS FLOAT -- AND THAT ALSO BIOFILMS ACCUMULATE ON THE SURFACE OF FLOODING PLASTICS THAT CAUSES THEM TO SING DE INTO DEEP WATERS. AND TO ACCUMULATE AND SENTIMENT. THE PRESENCE OF MICHAEL PLASTICS IN THE OCEAN IS NOW WELL ESTABLISHED EVEN IN VERY REMOTE ENVIRONMENTS FROM THE OCEAN AT JOHNMYERS TO THE POLLS. FROM THE COAST TO DEEP OCEAN TRENCHES -- MY PROPOSES A MISS AMPLE FROM BEACHES FROM SURFACE WATERS -- FROM DEEP WATERS INCLUDING IN THE MARIANAS TRENCH THEY FOUND SINGLE USE PLASTIC ITEMS. ADEPTS GREATER THAN TEN THOUSAND METERS. AT IN THE TRENCHES MOST POLLUTED REGIONS THEY FOUND A MAXIMUM OF TWO THOUSAND PIECES OF MICHAEL PLASTIC FOR LEADER OF SETTLEMENT. AND THIRTEEN PIECES OUR LEADER IN WATER SO IT'S CERTAIN OUT THE OCEAN FROM THE SURFACE TO THE DEBTS. ANSWERING CALIFORNIANS TO SOME OF THE WORK THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING LOOKING AT MICHAEL PLASTIC ON BEACHES AROUND CALIFORNIA WE FOUND MY CLASSICS THAT EVERY SINGLE ONE OF FIFTY ONE BEACH IS THAT WE SAMPLED -- WE KNOW THAT. RESIDENTS OF BEACHES LIKE TO PACIFIC MALL CRABS ARE INGESTING MICHAEL PLASTICS WITHIN ABOUT AND INGESTED MARKER FIVE SIX ON THIS IS ONE MECHANISM THESE FILTER FEEDING ORGANISMS THAT ARE VERY COMMON ON BEACHES IN CALIFORNIA. ONE MECHANISM OF MICHAEL PLASTICS ENTERING INTO COASTAL FOOD WEBS. AND EVEN IN REMOTE PLACES LIKE THE BEACHES OF OF THE CHANNEL ISLANDS WE FIND -- MARINE DEBRIS AND ALSO MICHAEL PLUS SIX ON THOSE BEACHES. WE FIND MICHAEL PLASTICS BEING DEPOSITED. IN BIOLOGICAL COMMUNITIES SO WE FOUND THAT -- PLASTIC WASTE CAN INCREASE THE DISEASE RISK OF CORALS ANNA ELEVATING DISEASE RISK ABOUT TWENTY TIMES FOR FOR CROSS THAT ARE ENVELOPED IN PLASTIC. ABOUT 75% OF TURTLE GRASS AND BELIEVES WAS FOUND TO HAVE OF MICROPROCESSOR ON THE SURFACE AND THE CENTER CITY THEM MENTIONS THAT MICHAEL PLASTICS ASSOCIATE WITH -- PHYTOPLANKTON AGGREGATE SO THIS IS ONE MECHANISM OF MICHAEL PLASTIC SINKING INTO SETTLEMENTS IN DEEPER WATERS. IS THAT -- WHAT MIGHT BE A BUOYANT PLASTIC AND BECOMES A NEGATIVE THE GOING AND WITH CHEN GENERALLY SINK DOWN INTO THE SETTLEMENTS? MIKE ABOUT SIX SEVEN FOUND ON THE BODIES OF A HUGE VARIETY OF MARINE ORGANISMS INCLUDING AND INVERTEBRATES AND FISH AND BIRDS AND MAMMALS. OVER TWO HUNDRED TWENTY SPECIES HAVE BEEN FOUND TO CAN SEEM LIKE A PLASTIC AND MORE THAN HALF OF THOSE ARE COMMERCIALLY TARGETED SPECIES. THE SMALL SIZE AMERICA PLASTICS IS PROBLEMATIC BECAUSE MANY ORGANISMS ACROSS A HUGE RANGE OF SIZES CAM CONSUME THEM AND THEY MAY NOT BE ABLE TO DISTINGUISH MIKE PLASTICS FROM THEIR NATURAL PLAYED PREY ITEMS. SO WE SEE DIRECT CONSUMPTION OF MICHAEL PLASTICS BY FILTER FEEDING ORGANISMS LIKE SOME OF THE ONES SEEN HERE FROM ALL THE WAY FROM PLANKTON UP TO MEGAFAUNA LIKE MANTA RAYS. AND WE'VE SEEN A MICRO PLASTICS THAT ARE DIRECTLY CONSUMED BY TO TRY TO FORCE LIKE THE MARANISS TRANCHE AMPHIPODS SO FOUND IN THE REALLY DEEP OCEANS -- WITH THE SENTIMENT FINDING -- THEM HAVE THEY'VE CONSUMED MICHAEL PLASTICS -- EVEN ENDANGERED SPECIES IN CALIFORNIA LIKE THE TIDE WATER GOBIES. WE RECENTLY FOUND MICHAEL PLASTICS IN THEIR GILLS. AND SPECIES OF SEA BIRD THAT IN JUST OCEAN OF ALSO BEEN SHOWN. TO TO INGEST MICROPROCESSOR. SO THEN THE CONCERNS ABOUT MICRO PLASTIC ARE THAT WE KNOW THAT ORGANISMS ARE EATING THEM ONE OF THE POTENTIAL CONSEQUENCES SO WE SEE PHYSICAL CONSEQUENCES SO CLOGGING OF THE GOD OR SATIATION SO THE ANIMALS ARE NOT. MOTIVATED TO FEED -- THAT LEAST ALTERED FEEDING BEHAVIOUR POTENTIALLY IMPACTION OF GOT PERFORATION AND TISSUE DAMAGE SO THESE ARE ALL PHYSICAL EFFECTS. AND THEN THERE MAY BE CHEMICAL EFFECTS FROM MICHAEL PLASTICS THAT INCLUDE A TOXICITY WHICH MAY BE DUE TO THE PLASTICS OR CHEMICALS THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THEM -- INFLAMMATORY RESPONSES IMMUNE RESPONSES AND IMPACTS TO REPRODUCTION AND GROWTH SO GENERALLY A LOT OF THE LIBERTY STUDIES -- AND FEEL CITIES THAT HAVE SHOWN IMPACTS OF MICHAEL PLASTIC TEND TO BE -- THE SUBTLE EFFECTS THAT ARE SUB LETHAL SO IMPACTS ON REPRODUCTION IMPACTS ON GROWTH -- OR IMPACTS OF INDIVIDUAL MORTALITY WE'RE NOT WE HAVEN'T DEMONSTRATED REALLY VERY BROAD POPULATION AND COMMUNITY LEVEL EFFECTS OF MICRO PLASTIC RIGHT NOW. BUT IT'S CERTAINLY SOMETHING WE SHOULD BE CONCERNED ABOUT BECAUSE MIKE PLASTICS ARE OBVIOUSLY INCREASING -- AND OUR ABILITY TO DETECT THEM AND TO DETECT THEIR EFFECT IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO INCREASE IN THE FUTURE. SO THESE ON GROWING CONCERNS AS I MENTIONED THAT MY REPLY SIX ARE UBIQUITOUS IN MARINA VARMINTS THEY ARE INCREASING -- OVER TIME. AND THERE SEEMS TO BE EVIDENCE OF A FACT -- VERTICALLY ON VULNERABLE LIFE HISTORY STAGES REPRODUCTIVE EFFECTS -- THAT COULD HAVE POPULATION LEVEL CONSEQUENCES. THE SEAFOOD CONSUMPTION IS ONE PATHWAY -- FOR PLASTICS EXPOSURE WE KNOW THAT THEIR PRESENT IN OUR COMMERCIALLY IMPORTANT SPECIES -- COMMERCIALLY IMPORTANT SPECIES LIKE MUSCLES AND OYSTERS AND FISH IS THAT ARE SOLD FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION. BUT IN MY REC REPRESENT A RELATIVELY SMALL BURDEN TO THE INDIVIDUAL CONSUMERS SO SOMETHING LIKE FIFTY TWO HUNDRED PARTICLES PER MUSCLE -- AND IT A VERY COMMITTED SEAFOOD EATER MIGHT CONSUME AS MANY AS ELEVEN THOUSAND PARTICLES PER YEAR. SO THESE BY ACCUMULATION AND FOOD CHAIN AFFECTED NOT YET WELL UNDERSTOOD BUT WE SHOULD HAVE CONCERN ABOUT THIS ISSUE BECAUSE MY CAPACITY CONTAMINATION OF THE AQUATIC ENVIRONMENTS WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. AND THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT KNOWLEDGE GAPS CURRENTLY -- ABOUT THE THE EFFECTS OF MICRO PLASTICS ON OUR MARINE ENVIRONMENT [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH SOBERING SOBERING PRESENTATIONS BOTH AND WE APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE SO LET'S OPEN UP THE THE FLORIDA QUESTIONS FOLKS HAVE THINGS THEY WANT TO ASK ABOUT. AS THEIR MONEY. THANK YOU I WANT TO THANK YOU BOTH I THINK. DR STEALS PRESENTATION YOU ALLUDED TO IT [inaudible] BUT THE FOOD CHAIN [inaudible] STUDIES ON FISH PRODUCTS CONSUMED BY HUMANS. ARE WE IS THERE DATA OR EVIDENCE SHOWING THE PLASTICS BEING TRANSFERRED. INTO HUMANS. THERE ARE STUDIES THAT HAVE SHOWN THAT HUMANS ARE CONSUMING MICHAEL PLASTICS AND AND THERE ARE STUDIES THAT SHOW. THE ABILITY OF MICHAEL PLASTICS TO TRANSFER FROM A PRIMER CONSUMING TO A SECONDARY CONSUMERS SO IT CERTAINLY DOES SEEM TO BE -- A RISK ALTHOUGH THE AS A SAY THE THE ACTUAL. LOAD OF MICHAEL PLASTICS IS A RELATIVELY SMALL CONTRIBUTION OF THE DIET. AND THEN THIS PAST YEAR THE OCEAN PROTECTION COUNCIL FUNDED A STUDY WE DON'T HAVE THE RESULTS YET I'M TO LOOK AT WHETHER MICRO PLASTICS ARE SERVING AS A VECTOR FOR DISEASE -- SO AS WE CAN SEEM SEAFOOD -- IS THERE SOME SORT OF THAT TRANSFER OF DISEASE TO HUMANS. TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH CONSEQUENCE I THINK IS THE WAY TO EXPAND. ON CULTURE STERN ALLUDED TO SOME PEOPLE THINK WELL THIS IS JUST TO COASTAL PROBLEM OR AN OCEAN IS A PROBLEM. BUT THOSE VECTORS OF HUMAN HEALTH IMPACTED. THAT SEEN ANYBODY LIVING ANYWHERE POTENTIALLY IMPACTED IN. IS ARE THERE ON IS THE OPC SUPPORTING ONGOING PUBLIC HEALTH STUDIES ON THIS ASPECT OF PLASTIC POLLUTION. YES [inaudible] THANK YOU. CAN YOU TELL ME IF THE IF THERE ANY. POSITIVE STORIES FROM AROUND THE WORLD THAT YOU HAVE COME ACROSS THAT GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT OF HOPE POLICY SOLUTIONS OR OR BEHAVIORAL CHANGES THAT YOU SEEN AN ANYWHERE -- THAT THAT WE CAN DRAW SOME LESSONS FROM. THAT WHERE WERE BEACH IS OR OR MARINE ECO SYSTEMS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO BOUNCE BACK. AS SO THERE'S A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS IN THERE I THINK THERE ARE SOME HOPEFUL STORIES I DON'T KNOW WHERE MARINE ECOSYSTEMS HAVE FOUND BACK. AND BUT I THINK IT RIGHT HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE SOME REALLY. INSPIRATIONAL STORIES IN TERMS OF THE THE PLASTIC BAG MAN IS A GREAT EXAMPLE A STARTED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL YOU KNOW GOVERNMENTS HERE AND THERE. AND CITIES STARTED BANNING PLASTIC BAGS AND THEN IT. IT BLOSSOMED INTO THIS AND OTHER REGIONS I THINK I'M CHAIRMAN STERN MENTIONED -- THE OR MAYBE IT WAS CHAIRMAN ON I'M SORRY. WHAT? IS HE HE MENTIONED THE WORK THAT'S GOING ON INTERNATIONALLY AND IN THE U. K. IT'S IT TO REALLY TAKE ON THIS NOTION OF THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY. I THINK THERE'S SOME REAL -- STRIDES THAT ARE BEING MADE IN DEVELOPING NEW PRODUCTS THAT ARE -- YOU KNOW. MADE OUT OF DIFFERENT DIFFERENT ELEMENTS THEN PETROLEUM PRODUCTS IN THAT BREAKDOWN IN DIFFERENT WAYS AND ARE MORE ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY AND THAT WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT AND AND CONSIDERING -- IN OUR IN OUR SYSTEMS AS WELL. I CAN I JUST MENTIONED SO THERE'S THIS OF TWO AREAS OF CONCERN WITH MICHAEL PLASTICS ONE AS MICROFIBER IS WHICH SEEM TO BE THE THE DOMINANT. ABOUT MICHAEL MICHAEL PLASTIC PARTICLE -- SO AT DRESSING -- THAT FROM A WASTE WATER PERSPECTIVE MIGHT BE REALLY -- ONE WAY TO MAKE GREAT STRIDES WITH THAT AND THEN THE OTHER -- LITTLE BIT OF HOPE THAT I WOULD LIKE TO THROW OUT THERE IS -- THE FRAGMENT THE PREDOMINANT ON BEACHES AND THAT IS ONE AREA THAT PEOPLE ARE MAKING BIG DIFFERENCES IN AN ACTUAL CLEANING UP AND SERVE. THAT BEING A MAJOR SOURCE OF FRAGMENTS OF MY CAPACITY -- IS ONE WAY THAT WE CAN -- HOPEFULLY REDUCE THEM ENTERING INTO THE OCEAN SO IT'S A BEACH CLEAN UP ALTHOUGH THEY SEEM LIKE ARE YOU KNOW THEY ARE IMPORTANT SORT OF SOCIAL OUT REACHED PEOPLE -- THEY CAN ACTUALLY REALLY IMPACTFUL IN REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF MY CLASSES THAT BEING GENERATED -- SURE YEAH. SIR THERE VITAL YOU'RE CERTAIN. WE DROVE DOWN A LITTLE MORE ON JUST THE THE STATE OF RESEARCH YOU TALKED ABOUT KNOWLEDGE GAPS AND WHERE IS THIS SORT OF SCIENCE AND RESEARCH COMMUNITY HEADING WITH THIS AND WHAT DO YOU GUYS SEE GOING FORWARD SAY IN THE NEXT. YEAR TO THAT. CENTER MY MISSION THE PUBLIC HEALTH SIDE OF THINGS -- THAT'S A I THINK OF SMART -- PAST THE TO TO GO DOWN CERTAINLY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT UP TAKE LOOKS LIKE IF I MEAN. AM I RIGHT TO SAY THAT DOCTOR STEAL IT SOME OF THE GAPS AROUND THE LIKE THE INTERACTION BETWEEN THE INGESTED PLASTIC ITSELF AND WHAT GOES INTO THE THE TISSUE SO IN OTHER WORDS. THE QUANTIFYING ME YOU USED ELEVEN THOUSAND PARTICLES PER PERSON -- AS A THAT AMOUNT IS DETECTED IN IN SPECIFIC AND THAT'S THAT'S ESTIMATED FOR A EUROPEAN CONSIDERED LIKE A HIGH LEVEL EUROPEAN CONSUMER OF OF SEAFOOD YEAH OKAY SO HOW HI SEAFOOD CONSUMER IN EUROPE IS A IS THAT ELEVEN THOUSAND WORLD. AND BUT BUT THE INTERACTION BETWEEN. THE THE THE THE MARINE LIFE INGESTION AND THEN THAT PASSED THROUGH THAT STILL NOT ENTIRELY UNDERSTOOD LIKE WE KNOW THAT IT ENDS UP IN THE PERSON WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY. HOW IT GETS THERE AN INTERESTING HUMANS IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO DETECT -- YOU KNOW THE IMPACT FOR MY PURPOSES FROM OTHER SOURCES FOR EXAMPLE SO THE BARTER STUDIES A LOOKING AT DID YOU TRANSFER OR A FOUNDRY COULD YOU TRANSFER. OF ORGANIC POLLUTANTS FROM MICHAEL SAM'S SO WE KNOW THAT THAT OCCURS -- BUT IT'S I DON'T KNOW OF ANY HUMAN STUDIES THAT WOULD BE GOING ON IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO SEPARATE THAT OUT FROM -- JUST SORT OF GENERAL EXPOSURE BUT YOU HAVE TO SORT YOU WORK BACKWARDS FROM DO YOU DO YOU EAT ANYTHING OUT OF THE OCEAN OR NOT. YET UNDERSTOOD YES SO I I'M FEELING A LITTLE WORSE ABOUT -- SUSHI. SO SO CAN I JUST MENTION TO MAKE PEOPLE FEEL A LITTLE BIT BETTER ABOUT THINGS SO THE THE WHOLE ORGANISM CONSUMES LIKE A MUSCLE FOR EXAMPLE. THE MICROPHONE SIX TEND TO BE IN THE GUT OF THE ANIMAL SO WE CAN SEE A WHOLE MUSCLE READING. EVERYTHING ABOUT THE ANIMAL BUT FOR FISHES FOR EXAMPLE -- THEIR FILLETED MOST MIKE PLASTICS WOULD NOT BE IN THE IN THE MUSCLE TISSUE SO BUT FOR THE EUROPEAN CONSUMER YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THEY CAN'T IMAGINE THEY'RE JUST EATING FISH BELLIES THIS THIS WOULD BE SEVENTY THOSE WOULD BE EATING A LOT OF SHELLFISH. FOR EXAMPLE AN OFFICE SAYS SHELLFISH IS THE PRIMARY OKAY OR OR OR OTHER FISHES THAT ARE CONSUMED HOLE. IS THE REASON IT'S NOT KOSHER YES EXACTLY. AND IS IT IT'S LIKE A LITTLE GUILT TRIP TO DO I DO HAVE -- CHAIR OF THE JEWISH CAUCUSES WELL -- ADAM POSE LITTLE BUT SO IN ADDITION TO PUBLIC HEALTH THE THIS SORT OF BROADER IMPACT ISSUE WITHIN SORT OF MARINE HEALTH AS AN ECOSYSTEM ITSELF NOT SO MUCH IN THE FISH CONSUMPTION SIDE OF THINGS. CAN YOU ARTICULATE A LITTLE MORE ABOUT -- THE STATE OF SO I I'D LIKE TO STRESS THAT THIS IS AN ADDITIVE PROBLEM SO I ALONG WITH ALL THE OTHER ISSUES IN THE MARINE ENVIRONMENT WITH OVER HARVESTING AND POLLUTION. AND CLIMATE CHANGE THAT THIS IS AN ADDITIONAL STRESSOR THAT ORGANISMS ARE UNDERGOING SO IT'S LIKELY GIVEN THAT WE'VE DEMONSTRATED EFFECTS ON REPRODUCTION FOR EXAMPLE OR AN INFLAMMATORY RESPONSES THAT THERE COULD BE -- POPULATION LEVEL AND AND COMMUNITY LEVEL AFFECTS SO ECOSYSTEMS BEING DAMAGED BY THIS YOUR MICROCLIMATE STICKS. A CERTAINLY AS AS MICHAEL PLUS THE INCREASE WE MIGHT EXPECT TO SEE MORE PREVALENT. IMPACTS TO MARINE COMMUNITIES LIKE THAT. THAT. COULD MEAN COULD THIS SOUP AND UP AT OUR SHORES I GUESS LET ME PUT IT MORE POINTEDLY THAT THAT MICRO PLASTIC. WHAT WOULD LIVES IN THOSE ON THOSE ISLANDS YOU KNOW THAT WE WE TALK WE'RE NOT JUST BIG PIECES RIGHT BUT THERE? IT IT CREATES. A SORT OF VISCOUS QUALITY IN THE WATER YES. MAY I WITH A WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IT AS THAT. AS OUR LUCIEN CLOUD EXPANDS THAT WE MAY ACTUALLY SEE MORE INTERFACE WITH THIS IN OUR COMMUNITIES I MEAN WE'RE SEE MORE ON THE CALIFORNIA COAST NOT LESS IN THE FUTURE. WELL IT'S IT'S CERTAINLY GLOBAL PROBLEM WE KNOW THAT FIVE SIX OR SIX CIRCULATING IN THE OCEANS AND SO. I THINK IT WILL DEPEND A LOT ON OUR ACTIONS IN REDUCING LOCAL SOURCES OF WE WE HAVE CONTROL OVER THOSE ACTIONS YOU SAW THE RED AROUND R. COSTA YOU SHOW THAT GLOBAL MAP OF ALL THE HOT SPOT. I GET A BIG -- A DARK RED OFF THE WEST COAST THE UNITED STATES I READ THAT MAP RIGHT IS THAT CORRECT YEAH SO THAT'S YOU KNOW CONSEQUENCE OF THERE BEING A LOT OF PEOPLE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA OR THE WEST COAST. AND THE MICHAEL PLASTIC THAT WE'RE SEEING ARE EIGHT YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF SYNTHETIC FIBERS AND SUCH OFF OUR SHORES SO -- IT'S A RELATIVELY LOW SLIGHTLY LOWER DENSITY IN THE WATER SLIGHTLY HIGHER DENSITY IN THE SENTIMENTS BUT IT CERTAINLY PRESENT ALONG WITH CALIFORNIA'S. BUT IT'S NOT FAIR TO BLAME CHINA. IT'S DIFFICULT TO SAY THE SOURCES OF MICRO PLASTIC POLLUTION THIS IS ONE OF THE MAJOR ISSUES THAT WE HAVE BECAUSE THEY ARE. SMALL PARTICLES THAT DON'T COME STAMPED WITH THE MADE IN CHINA KIND OF YOU KNOW STAMP SO IT'S DIFFICULT TO SAY. THE SOURCES OF POLLUTION WE KNOW THAT THEY CIRCULATE SO WE GO OFF THE COAST TWENTY MILES TO THE CHANNEL ISLANDS. I'LL BE FINE MICHAEL PLASTICS THERE SO WE KNOW THEY'RE CIRCULATING FROM THE COAST AND AND OUT. INTO THE OCEAN WATERS SO IT'S DIFFICULT TO PIN DOWN THE SOURCES OF MY PROPOSED SOLUTION -- A LOT OF WHAT WE CAN DO IS REALLY JUST IDENTIFYING THE TYPES OF PLASTIC IN LOOKING AT THE LIKELY SOURCES SO WHEN WE FIND SYNTHETIC FIBERS WE THINK THEY PROBABLY COME FROM WASTE WATER FROM DOMESTIC WASHING MACHINES FOR EXAMPLE -- BUT IT'S HARD TO SAY EXACTLY WHERE MICHAEL PLASTICS -- WHERE ANY ONE INDIVIDUAL MIKE BLESSING TO COME FROM? AND THAT'S ACTUALLY PART OF THE MICROPROCESSOR CHATTED G. THAT AND THAT WE'RE DEVELOPING RIGHT NOW IS HELPING TO FIGURE OUT IS STANDARDIZED METHODOLOGY FOR CHARACTERIZING. THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF MICROPROCESSOR THAT THEN WE CAN BEGIN TO TAKE STEPS TO ADDRESS AND THE SOURCES. WELCOME SENATOR JACKSON. YES YOU SEE I IS A BRING THEIR EXPERTISE TO BEAR DOCTOR STEEL JUST PERFECT ROUNDUP WELCOME. YEAH. THEN WE GOT. OUR BACKGROUNDER ON PAGE THREE TALKS ABOUT GLOBAL RESPONSES CAN EACH OF YOU A COMMENT ON THE EUROPEAN UNION DIRECTIVE THAT WAS PASSED LAST WINTER. BANNING OR REACHING A FAN OF MANY SINGLE USE PLASTIC ITEMS. SETTING MINIMUM CONTENTS AND FORTUNATELY THIS LEGISLATURE WAS UNABLE TO GET TO A MINIMUM CONTENT ON PLASTIC IN IN A CALL FOR EXTEND PRODUCER RESPONSIBILITIES -- WHICH THIS. LEGISLATURE WAS ON THE ROAD TO GET TO IT AT ON THE WHAT THE EUROPEANS JUST DID. FOUR MONTHS AGO. I WELL I CAN CERTAINLY TALK TO WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT WHAT'S IN THE MARINE ENVIRONMENTS ABOUT 8290% OF THE PLASTIC THAT WE'RE SEEING IN THE ENVIRONMENT COME FROM SINGLE HE'S PLASTIC SO IT SEEMS LIKE -- A GOOD WAY OF REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF OCEAN PLASTICS TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF SINGLE USE PLASTIC. YEAH I THINK THEY THEY WHEN THEY AUTHORED AT THEY TALK ABOUT THE MARINE DEBRIS ISN'T AS AS THE GOAL. MR MISUNDERSTAND YEAH I IS SO I THINK THAT THIS IS AN AREA WHERE WE ACTUALLY DO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN FROM OUR COLLEAGUES AROUND THE WORLD AND AND TO TAKE. THEM VERY LEADERSHIP. IN IN HAND SO AND THE E. U. HAS BEEN QUITE AGGRESSIVE ON PLASTICS AND I THINK AND YOU KNOW. IN AT I THINK IT WAS IN. WRITTEN IN THE BRITAIN IS THE FIRST PLACE WHERE STARBUCKS ANNOUNCED IT WAS GOING TO ELIMINATE STRIDES LAST YEAR AND THERE'S A LOT OF WORK ON EXTENDED PRODUCER RESPONSIBILITY AND ON AND SOURCE REDUCTION AND ON EXTENDED PRODUCER RESPONSIBILITY. AND AND I THINK WE NEED TO WE NEED TO BE LEARNING FROM THIS COUNTRY'S. CAN I FOLLOW UP YOU HAD YOUR THREE PRONGED YEAH -- AGENCY OR YOU'RE THE COUNCIL IS WORKING ON YOUR SOURCE PRODUCTION. THE CITY OF ALAMEDA NICE CITY HIGHLAND FORTY THOUSAND PEOPLE YOU SPEND FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS I BELIEVE AND YOU GET. TEN TEN RESTAURANTS A REDUCE THEIR PLASTICS AND SAVE FORTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS EACH PER YEAR IS THAT I GET THAT RIGHT ON THE SEA WE SPENT IT WAS FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR PILOT PROJECT THE GOAL IS ULTIMATELY TO GET HUNDRED RESTAURANTS. AND PARTICIPATING TODAY WE HAVE FORTY SIX PARTICIPATING AND SO WE ARE WE'RE ABOUT HALFWAY AND IT THE DATA THAT I HAD WAS ONLY FROM TEN OF THOSE FORTY SIX SO IT'S AS A SMALL PERCENTAGE BUT I GUESS. THANK YOU. ONE OTHER THING YOU KNOW WE'RE GONNA DO OUR BEST TO TRY TO REDUCE -- WASTIN AND AND WERE ACTUALLY HEARING A BILL LATER ON TODAY YOU ABOUT THIS VERY TOPIC -- BUT BUT HOW HOW MUCH OF RIVER OF NO RETURN WITH REGARDS TO THIS IMPACT ON HOW WE GONNA CLEAN UP. YOU KNOW THIS THIS POLLUTION THAT EXIST IN SO MANY PLACES IN OUR OCEANS -- WHAT WHAT IS THE? WITH THE GLOBAL PLAN ON ON ON ON DEALING WITH THE PROBLEM AS ALREADY EXISTS AS OPPOSED. TO TRY TO REDUCE. THE IMPACT OF THE PROBLEM IN THE FUTURE. I THINK THIS IS A LOT LIKE CLIMATE CHANGE AND I THOUGHT I WOULD SAY THAT IT IS A GLOBAL PROBLEM WE ARE CONTINUING TO EMITS PLASTIC PARTICLES JUST AS WORRIED MEETING. AIRBORNE CARBON DIOXIDE PARTICLES AND AND IT'S GOING TO REQUIRE LOCAL ACTION AND GLOBAL ACTION AND AT SOME POINT WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO CLEAN UP WHATEVER IS OUT THERE. AND AND GET RID OF IT BUT WE DO HAVE TO STOP OUR OUR CONTINUED PRODUCTION IS THERE ANY EFFECTIVE WAY OF MITIGATING THE THE MICRO CLASSICS PROBLEM AS IT EXISTS RIGHT NOW [inaudible] NOW. I DON'T BELIEVE THERE'S A WAY TO MITIGATE MY PROPOSES ONCE THEY'RE IN THE ENVIRONMENT AND THE REALLY ALL WE NEED TO YOU KNOW THAT THE MAJOR THING THAT WE NEED TO DO IS TO REDUCE THE SOURCE OF THEM THERE'S THERE'S THERE THERE'S NO EFFECTIVE WAY CURRENTLY. TO TAKE THEM OUT OF THE ENVIRONMENT. NEVER GONE AWAY WHAT IF I MAY THAT THE TRASH WE'LL. RIGHT I MEAN THE THE HIPPOS OUT THERE THEY CANNOT GRAB THIS STUFF UP RIGHT THAT'S WHY IT'S AND MIKE RUNNER THE TRASH WAS PICKED UP THE BIG STUFF RIGHT RIGHT YEAH. YES IN THE CHAT THE IDEA THE TRASH WILL IS TO PREVENT THAT TRASH FROM BECOMING MORE MICRO PLAZA. SENATOR HAS AN IDEA WE CAN GET HASBRO -- TO TO SUBMIT TO BASICALLY SPONSOR HUNGRY HIPPOS. GO OUT THERE AND AND HARBORS ALL UP AND DOWN THE COAST YOU LAUGH YEAH NO IT'S A GOOD IDEA. YEAH WELL THERE ARE PROJECTS LIKE AND YOU KNOW LEGOS IS STARTING TO USE RECYCLED PLASTIC GET'S LEGACY IT IS THIS IS ONE AREA WHERE. AND YEAH AT THE THERE'S NOT. THANK YOU. TO BOTH CHAIRMAN'S IN THAT THANK YOU FOR THE VERY -- EDUCATIONAL -- SO GUY IN AND WE'VE HEARD ABOUT -- MICHAEL PLASTICS AND IN THE OCEANS AND IT'S NICE TO HEAR -- EDUCATED PEOPLE TALK ABOUT IT. AND HOW WE CAN -- MEDICAID IN SOME WAYS SO I I'M JUST A FEW QUESTIONS -- IN ANY KIND OF ALLUDED TO BEFORE READY NOT KNOWING BUT DO WE KNOW WHAT THE U. S. CONTRIBUTION IS TO THE OVERALL PROBLEM IN THE OCEAN STARTING WITH LARGE PLASTICS BEING. ADDED I MEAN I THINK. A LOT OF CLOSE TO COMMUNITIES -- EMILY COMMUNITIES THAT MATTER HAVE GOOD SORTING MECHANISMS TO GET THE PLASTICS -- EITHER RECYCLED OR UNFORTUNATELY ONLY 11% I THINK A RECYCLE THE REST OF IT ARE PUT INTO LANDFILLS AND AND ELSEWHERE AND I THINK. OF THE EASTERN SEABOARD IS PROBABLY EQUALLY AS A CONSCIOUS AS WE ARE -- BUT WHAT WHAT LITTLE I HAVE SEEN IN AND AND AND THE WAY A DOCUMENTARY USES A SHOWING THAT ASIA IS A VERY STRONG -- THE MATTER IF YOU WILL OF THE GROSS PLASTICS INTO OUR OCEANS AT THE TERRY AND BECOME A MICROFIBER SELECTION OF THAT NUMBER ONE NUMBER -- TWO THE TOXICOLOGY OF MICRO FIBERS TO HUMANS THE THE THE CONCERN THE MICRO FIBERS AYE AYES I ASSUME FROM MY MY BACKGROUND AT THE MICRO FIBERS ARE NON DIGESTIBLE -- I SOONER JUST EXCRETED BUT MAYBE THERE IS SOME -- DANGERS TO HUMANS AND I'D LIKE TO KNOW ABOUT ANY TOXICOLOGY STUDIES THAT HAVE BEEN -- DISCUSSED. AND THE NEW BROUGHT UP THAT THE LA AREA WHERE WE PROBABLY DON'T REALLY THINK ABOUT VERY MUCH AND AND THAT IS -- WASHING THE WASHING MACHINE -- EFFLUENT YOU KNOW THAT A LOT OF OUR PERMITS TODAY SOME HAVE FORMS OF PLASTIC AND AND SOME OF THESE PLASTIC COFFEE MICRO FIBERS ARE MAKING THEIR WAY INTO OUR WATER SUPPLY IN THAT WAY THEY'RE GETTING OUT INTO THE OCEAN SO. AND I THINK THAT THE PUBLIC IS REALLY NOT REALLY -- AWARE OF THAT AND SO. WE HAVE WASHING MACHINES AT YOU KNOW PROTECT THE ENGINE OF THE WASHING MACHINES AND DRYERS SO WHAT WITH -- FILTERS AND WASHING FACTORS TO RECOGNIZE THIS PROBLEM AND YOU KNOW YOU CAN PUT A MICRON FILTER IN THERE TO YOU KNOW JUST LIKE WE CAN. TAKE A LENT OUT OF THE DRYERS TO TO MEDICAID THIS THIS PROBLEM THAT -- MAYBE JUST HASN'T BEEN ILLUMINATED ENOUGH FOR THE THOUGHT FOR THE PUBLIC AND CERTAINLY THE MANY FACTORS OF THE MACHINES UNDERSTAND. YES THANK YOU S. SENATOR AND THE FIRST OF US AS FAR AS THE UNITED STATES CONTRIBUTION I DON'T HAVE THOSE EXACT NUMBERS NOW I CAN CERTAINLY AND LOOK FOR THOSE. I I WOULD NOTE THAT AND THEY'VE PROBABLY CHANGED SIGNIFICANTLY SINCE CHINA STOPPED ACCEPTING A MOST OF OUR RECYCLABLES AN ANSWER NOW OUR WASTE STREAM DIVERSION IS IS VERY DIFFERENT THAN IT WAS JUST A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO AND OUR IMPACT ON THE ENVIRONMENT. AND ARE GOING TO BE DIFFERENT AND YOU KNOW THAT THE IMPACTS FROM CHINA MAY BE DIFFERENT AS WELL SO -- I CAN LOOK INTO THAT FOR YOU AND IN TERMS OF THE I I AM GOING TO DEFER TO DOCTOR STEEL ON THE DANGERS OF PLASTICS HUMANS AND AND HOW THEY INTERACT. WITH THE HUMAN BODY THAT IS ONE OF THE STUDIES THAT WERE WERE FINDING RIGHT NOW BUT I DON'T KNOW THE RESULTS. AND AND AS FAR AS AS WASHING THAT THAT IS DEFINITELY THE AND A POPULAR IDEA RIGHT NOW AND SOMETHING WE'VE BEEN CONTACTED AT IF YOU SEE ABOUT. AND AS WE DO OUR AS WE ROLL OUT OR PROP SIXTY EIGHT FUNDING PROPOSALS AND COMPETITIVE GRANT -- ARE IF HE'S THERE WILL PROBABLY INCLUDE THINGS ALONG THOSE LINES TO SEE WHAT KINDS OF TECHNOLOGIES ARE OUT THERE TO REALLY FACILITATE AND THAT MEDICATION ASPECT. YEAH I'M I'M JUST AS CONCERNED AS YOU ARE WITH -- CHINA LONGER EXPECTED -- ACCEPTING OUR PLASTICS -- SO. THERE WAS EVER A TIME TO YOU KNOW REALLY ADDRESS THE THE ECYCLING EFFORTS UNDER WAY IN AND WE HAVE SOME BILLS THAT WE'RE GONNA BE ENTERTAINING THIS YEAR DUE. TO INCREASE EVER SAY WILL AND WE HAVE TO COME UP WITH A BETTER SYSTEM -- TO CERTAINLY -- TAKE THE THE PLASTICS OF OUR LANDFILLS AND MAKE SURE THAT THE CLASSIC STONED AND UP INTO. INTO OUR OCEANS AND SO I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE TO ENSURE THAT WE WE EFFECTUATE SOME SOME LEADERSHIP IN THE SAME. WE GOT A A BIGELOW BE A LOT OF WATER WE HAVE A LOT OF COUNTRIES THAT DON'T HAVE THE ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP THAT THAT. WE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE HERE IN THE UNITED STATES AND WE NEED TO DO WE CAN TO AS AS A GLOBAL COMMUNITY TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM -- THAT YOU HAVE OF ARTICULATION IS VERY PERVASIVE. THANK YOU THERE WILL BE OPPORTUNITY. WE'RE JUST ON THAT LATER TODAY -- CENTER JACKSON MANSON COPIER THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE -- AND TO KNOW WHEN WE TALK ABOUT STEWARDSHIP CALIFORNIA TENDS TO LEAD THE WAY SO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE BE. OUT THERE FIRST IF IF WE POSSIBLY CAN AND WITH THAT IN MIND -- I I'M WORKING ON THIS WHOLE ISSUE OF FARM -- IT UNDER A BILL THAT I'VE INTRODUCED SB FOUR TWENTY FOUR ON EXTENDED PRODUCER RESPONSIBILITY. AND WE DID A BILL LAST YEAR DID A BILL LAST YEAR. ON APR -- FOUR DRUGS AND SHARPS AND I THINK IT'S A MODEL THAT WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO EXPAND HERE THE TEST SAYS TO THE PRODUCERS OF THESE PRODUCTS LOOK FOLKS. YOU CAN'T JUST MANUFACTURE THEM pTHERE'S THE END OF LIFE CYCLE THAT IS REALLY CREATING. SERIOUS PROBLEMS SO I WONDER. WITH THAT IN MIND IF YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS ABOUT IN EP OUR APPROACH THAT IF YOU'RE AWARE OF THE THE BASICALLY WHAT WE DID LAST YEAR WITH THE THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY WE SEE SAID HERE'S THE GOAL. YOU'VE GOT TO YOU'VE GOT TO TAKE BACK THESE END OF PRODUCTS AT THE END OF THEIR LIVES AND YOU'VE GOT TO DISPOSE OF THEM. AND DO IT WITHOUT CHARGING THE CONSUMER FOR IT -- AND YOU FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO IT. AND BASICALLY WE SET THOSE PARAMETERS AND NOBODY KNOWS THEIR BUSINESS I WOULD SUGGEST BETTER THAN NAY AND SO THEY WERE ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH THAT. THERE WAS CIGARETTE ****. AND FRANKLY. WHEN WE DO OUR CLEAN UP DAYS THERE'S NO QUESTION BUT WHAT THE NUMBER ONE SOURCE OF POLLUTION IS OUT THERE IT'S CIGARETTE ****? AND THOSE FILTERS THE CELLULOSE FILTER A VERY SERIOUS PROBLEM I I BELIEVE THEY CONTAIN CARCINOGENIC MATERIALS THERE THEY ARE IN OUR BEACHES THE WILDLIFE WILL INGESTED THE MARINE LIFE AND JUST SAID -- DO YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS ON HOW WE ADDRESS THAT PROBLEM AS WELL AS THE MORE OBVIOUS PLASTIC AND EVEN MICRO. PLASTICA ELEMENTS -- BUT CERTAINLY IS CIGARETTE **** ARE AN OBVIOUS PROBLEM AND ONE THAT PERHAPS WE CAN ADDRESS THROUGH THE E. P. R. PROCESS TO SHARE SOME THOUGHTS ON THAT. KLAY YET CLEARLY CIGARETTE **** ARE -- AS YOU MENTIONED THE NUMBER ONE ITEM THAT'S PICKED UP IN COASTAL CLEANUP DAYS AND ARE PERVASIVE THROUGHOUT OUR BEACHES SO AND I THINK A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO ADDRESSING. PLASTICS IS GONNA BE THE MOST IMPORTANT AND ONE THAT IS THAT SCIENTIFICALLY. VALID IN REAL FAST AND THAT -- IS IMPLEMENTABLE AND SCALABLE SO YOU MIGHT NEED TO START AT A AT A LOCAL LEVEL AND BUILD UP OR STARTED A STATE LEVEL AND BILL THAT NATIONALLY OR INTERNATIONALLY. BUT AT AT THE END OF THE DAY WE NEED TO BE TAKING. A MUCH BROADER APPROACH THEN -- JUST ITEM BY ITEM BECAUSE EVERY TIME WE ADDRESS ONE ITEM ANOTHER ONE WILL POP UP. DO YOU THINK IF WE IF I MAY TO THE CHAIR WHO -- CREATE THIS KIND OF U. P. R. SYSTEM STARTING WITH CIGARETTE THAT IT WOULD BE APPLICABLES THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE PROCESS I MEAN IF THE THE WITH THE GRADE THESE THESE PRODUCTS TO GRADE EITHER NATURALLY OR THEY RETAINED. WHAT WAS IT SOME? WAS A WHALE THAT WAS JUST CAUGHT AND HAD EIGHTY POUNDS OF PLASTIC IN ITS BELLY MEANS. ARE YOU SHOW THE SLIDE OF THAT YET I MEAN THAT TERRIBLY. UNSETTLING TO KNOW THAT THE AND I THINK THAT I I'D RATHER SEE US USING THE WHAT IS IT THE LITTLE. TRASH WHEELS OF THEN ARE -- YOU KNOW MAMMAL LIFE OUR MARINE MAMMAL LIKE BUT I'M JUST WONDERING IF THERE'S SOME DIRECTION AGAIN WE TEND TO LEAD. I KNOW -- CENTER WHITE HOUSE HE'S BEEN BIG ON THE EPR ISSUE I'M JUST WONDERING IF YOU HAVE SOME SUGGESTIONS YOU MENTION A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN I MEAN IS THERE SOME SOME HELP YOU CAN GIVE US HERE IN THIS? CONCEPT. AND I THINK WHAT WOULD WOULD BE MOST EFFECTIVE IS IF WE COULD SET UP A MEETING WITH YOU AND I'M TALK IN DEPTH ABOUT KIND OF WHAT WHAT YOUR GOALS ARE AND AND OBVIOUSLY I I CAN'T TAKE A POSITION ON ANY SORT OF LEGISLATION I'M HERE. AS PART OF THE ADMINISTRATION SO I FEEL A LITTLE CONSTRAINED AND BY LAW I'M NOT IT YOU KNOW IT YEAH CAN WE HAVEN'T ACTUALLY -- VETTED THE THE THE IN SUGGEST RACE THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE BUT PERHAPS A CONFERENCE THAT CONVERSATION WOULD BE HELPFUL I WOULD BE HAPPY TO DO THAT FROM MY PERSPECTIVE MISTER CHAIRS. I THINK WE I THINK THERE'S THE CASE IS WELL ESTABLISHED THIS IS A REALLY BAD PROBLEM THE THE PLASTICS THE ISSUE IS AS YOU SUGGESTED WITH YOUR PRIOR QUESTION. HOW DO WE SOLVE IT I THINK THAT'S WHERE WE NEED TO BE GOING NEXT? I THINK IF I COULD JUST ADD ONE THING WHAT ONE OF THAT AND THE TOPICS I MENTIONED BEFORE AND A LITTLE EARLIER WAS. AND THIS IDEA OF MOVING TO DIFFERENT TYPES OF PRODUCTS PRODUCTS IN MOVING AWAY FROM PETROLEUM BASED PLASTIC PRODUCTS -- I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF RESEARCH AND A LOT OF INNOVATION THAT'S GOING ON AND THAT WE COULD BE SUPPORTING. AND THAT WOULD MOVE US AWAY FROM THE THE PERSISTENT PLASTICS AND TOWARDS SOMETHING THAT IS MORE EASILY COMPOSTABLE OR OR DEGREE TO PAUL. THAT'S RIGHT. SAN ANTONIO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- I'D LIKE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT SOME OF THE OTHER -- PRODUCTS THAT MAKE THAT MADE. PROVE FRUITFUL IN GOOD FOR CALIFORNIA AT AT SOME OTHER TIME BUT MY MY ISSUE THE ISSUE THAT'S BEEN RAISED -- TO ME RECENTLY IS. NOW THAT TRYING IS NOT TAKING PLASTIC IS THE THE NEED FOR STRAWBERRY GROWERS TO GET RID OF THE PLASTIC THEY THEY PUT ON THE GROUND IN ORDER TO KEEP THE PLANTS -- SAFE I THEY USUALLY ROLL IT UP AND THE IT WAS PART OF THE SHIPMENT TO CHINA IT CAN NO LONGER GO AND SO. WE'RE GONNA HAVE A CRISIS ON OUR HANDS IT'S IT'S DIRTY PLASTIC IT'S GOT A LOT OF DIRT IN IT. AND AND THERE'S NO PLACE TO PUT IT AND IT'S LOCATED IN ON OUR CENTRAL CAST REGION SO -- IT WE NEED TO KIND OF PUT THAT UP ON THE RADAR SCREEN I'M TOLD THAT THERE IS A COMPANY THAT -- THAT DOES DISPOSE OF IT AND IT MAY BE AN INCINERATION TYPE OF OF PRODUCT -- BUT I I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT SO IF THERE'S IF YOU HAVE ANY INFORMATION I'D BE INTERESTED IN FIND THAT THAT CAME TO ME WITH IN THE PAST WEEK AND I THINK WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO DO SOMETHING PRETTY QUICK BECAUSE THERE WILL BE TONS OF IT. THERE ARE TONS OF IT I THINK THEY THE YEAR IS A REALLY IMPORTANT POINT WHICH IS AGRICULTURAL. AND WASTE AND AND IT'S ASSOCIATION OF MARINE TO CREATE SOMETHING THAT OFTEN PEOPLE DON'T CONNECT -- BUT WE END UP SEEING YOU KNOW TWIST TIES FROM AND FROM AGRICULTURAL THAT OPERATIONS. TENS OR HUNDREDS OF MILES AWAY% ENDING UP IN THE OCEAN SO I YOU RAISE A VERY IMPORTANT POINT. OKAY REALLY DO APPRECIATE THIS VERY INFORMATIVE -- PANEL HEARING I I WILL SAY IT IT ALSO POINTS OF THE IMPORTANCE OF CONTINUED INVESTMENT IN OUR PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM BECAUSE WE DO HAVE FANTASTIC PROFESSORS ALL UP AND DOWN THE STATE. WHO DO GREAT WORK I BRING INFORMATION TO US ABOUT THE REALITIES OF THE WORLD? AND SO WE DO APPRECIATE YOUR TESTIMONY AND AND AND THE AND THE CONTINUED WORK THAT WE WILL BE THERE TO TRY TO ADDRESS SOME OF THESE BIG PROBLEMS WE'VE GOT. A ONE OR TWO SOLUTIONS TODAY THAT WILL BE LOOKING AT LATER ON DURING OUR OUR HEARING BUT THANK YOU FOR YOUR PARTICIPATION. YOUR YOUR WORK IN THIS AREA. ALL RIGHT OUR NEXT PANEL AS WE MENTIONEDIS GOING TO FOCUS ON A PLUS WHICH IS IMPACT ON MARINE WILDLIFE AND LOCAL EFFORTS WE LIKE TO ASK. A DOCTOR JEFF BONE IS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE MARINE MAMMAL CENTER TO COME FORWARD AND ALSO MERRIAM COURTED WHO IS -- PROGRAM DIRECTOR FOR UPSTREAM. AND WITH MY ONCE YOU ONCE YOU GET STARTED GET A STARTED -- DOCTOR BOB. WELL HE'S PREPARING ALL JUST LET FOLKS KNOW THAT A DOCTOR BOMBS THE EXACT DIRECTOR OF THE MARINE MAMMAL CENTER WHICH IS ALSO LEGAL. AND HE'S BEEN EXACTLY DIRECTOR SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT THANK YOU -- ALLEN [inaudible] WELL IN. MANY MEMBERS ARE OFFERED WHICH REAL PRIVILEGE TO BE HERE AT THIS MORNING TO SPEAK ON THIS I AM. I DO FEEL THE DOWNER OF THIS DISCUSSION BUT I GOT TO SAY THAT I AND MY MY FIRM BELIEF IS THAT MOST OF US ARE HERE IN THIS ROOM BECAUSE WE'RE OPTIMIST SO SO. THERE'S THAT -- THAT SAID I COULD AND AVOID SEEING IRONY THIS MORNING OF WAKING UP IN A HOTEL ROOM AND HAVING TO CLAW MY WAY THROUGH PLASTIC TO GET TO A SOAP BAR AND TO A COFFEE CUP SO IT'S JUST. IT'S HARD IT'S UBIQUITOUS STUFF -- I SPEAK FOR THE MARINE MAMMAL CENTER I'M TRYING VETERINARIAN FOR KEEPING SCORING COLLEGES AT UC DAVIS AND UC SAN DIEGO -- AND SPEAK FOR THE WORK THAT WE DO WITH THE MARINE MAMMAL CENTER BUT ALSO FOR THE BROADER IMPACTS ON MARINE WILDLIFE SO I WANT TO TRY IT THROUGH SOME SLIGHT WITH YOU. TO SPEAK TO THAT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT YOU KNOW LEADING MARINE MAMMAL TEACHING HOSPITAL THERE'S NO ORGANIZATION -- IN THE WORLD THAT SEES MORE PATIENTS THAN WE DO WE FIELD MORE THAN TEN THOUSAND CALLS INTO OUR RESCUE OFFICE EACH AND EVERY YEAR SO WE'RE OUT THERE AND WHERE THE EYES. AND EARS AND THE RESCUERS OF THESE MARINE MAMMALS WE HAVE FACILITY. IN -- SAUSALITO WHICH WAS RENOVATED BACK IN. TWO THOUSAND NINE IN OTHER WORDS WE'RE ALSO FIRST RESPONDERS VETERINARIANS SCIENTISTS TEACHERS TRAINERS THAT ANIMAL TRAINERS BUT TRAINERS OF PEOPLE. COMMUNICATORS PROBLEM SOLVERS AND CONSERVATIONISTS. THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT WE SEE ARE QUITE DIVERSE EVERYTHING FROM MALNUTRITION TO INFECTIOUS DISEASES -- IN THESE PHOTOS YOU SEE ONE OF OUR SENIOR SCIENTISTS -- LOOKING INTO THE CAUSE OF THE DEATH OF A WHALE OFTEN SHIP STRIKES OFTEN MALNUTRITION CENTER IMAGE THERE IS -- AN IMAGE OF A BRAIN WHERE YOU'RE SEEING -- ATROPHY OF TISSUE FROM THE MOLE LIKE ACID THAT TOXIN PRODUCED BY HARMFUL ALGAL BLOOMS. AND VERY -- VERY -- DISTURBINGLY CALIFORNIA SEA LION THAT IS SEVERELY SEVERELY INJURED BY MARINE DEBRIS IN THIS CASE -- DEBRIS FROM -- FISHING. LINES FISHING NETS IT CETERA. I WANT TO FOCUS ON ON PLASTICS WHEN WE LOOK IN AGGREGATE AT THE IMPACTS OF THE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT CAUSE DISTRESS AND DISEASE FOR OUR ANIMALS POPULIST IS MALNUTRITION. THERE IS A CATEGORY ABOUT 10% OF OUR ANIMALS WE CAN ATTRIBUTE THE HARM. DIRECTLY TO HUMAN PRACTICES WITHIN THAT CATEGORY IS MARINE DEBRIS WILL SEE EVERYTHING FROM ANIMALS AND TANGLED IN FISHING LINE QUITE COMMONLY. TO INGESTION OF PLASTICS -- AND IT'S IT'S ALWAYS VERY DISTURBING FINDING. LIKE SENATOR ALLEN -- I SAW THE NEWS OUT OF THE PHILIPPINES -- THIS WEEKEND WHICH WAS DISTURBING I ALSO TRIED IT THROUGH WHAT THE GENERAL PUBLIC MIGHT HAVE SEEN IN THIS PAST YEAR AND IN THE GUARDIAN THERE WAS THE REPORT OF A AWAY ALL DYING AFTER EATING EIGHTY BAGS IN THE NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC THERE WERE A COUPLE OF ARTICLES JUST OVER THIS -- SAME PAST YEAR WERE SPERM WHALE HAD INGESTED THIRTEEN POUNDS OF PLASTIC DEBRIS AND DIED -- THERE WAS ALSO REPORT NAT GEO OF A A DEATH OF A SEAL WITH A PLASTIC BAG FOUND IN ITS STOMACH -- IN THE UK'S INDEPENDENT THERE IS A REPORT OF A SEAL THAT HAD BEEN REHABILITATED AND PHYSICALLY DAMAGED IS ABLEBY THE ENTANGLEMENT THAT IT HAD FACE TO THE POINT THAT THEY COULDN'T EVEN WRITE ITSELF. POINT POINT BEING THAT THESE -- THESE REPORTS EVEN IN FRONT OF THE PUBLIC ARE ARE COMMON THIS IS A UBIQUITOUS PROBLEM THE RESULTS IN THE IMPACTS OF IT ARE UBIQUITOUS. AS WELL BUT THAT'S IN THE IN THE PUBLIC. DOMAIN. WENT TO THE SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE AS WELL JUST OFFER YOUYOU -- FOR QUOTATIONS FROM WHAT ARE THREE DIFFERENT -- PAPERS OUT THERE BUT THE FIRST IN JUSTIN AND TANGLE MEN AND DEBRIS HAS BEEN DOCUMENTED OVER SPECIES. OVER THE SET OVER SEVEN YEARS A SEVEN YEAR PERIOD I SHOULD SAY THIRTEEN SPERM WHALE STRANDED IN ITALY WHEN THEY WERE LOOKED AT FROM POST MORTEM POINT OF VIEW -- MARINE DEBRIS WAS FOUND IN TEN OUT OF THIRTEEN SPECIMENS AND IT WAS MOSTLY PLASTIC SO IT OUT THERE IN IN THE KINDA ANECDOTAL PUBLIC DOMAIN IT'S OUT THERE IN THE SCIENTIFIC. LITERATURE AS WELL AND IT'S IMPACTS ARISING FROM UNTANGLING CAN RESULT IN INJURY DROWNING OR STRANGULATION AND THOSE FROM INGESTION VERY FROM. NO DISCERNIBLE IMPACT TO ACTUAL BLOCKAGE OF THE DIGESTIVE TRACT OTHERS HAVE ALREADY ALLUDED TO WHAT WE DO AND WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE PRESENCE OF THOSE PLASTICS AS A GRANTED. A DIGESTIVE TRACT SUB LETHAL EFFECTS MAY COMPROMISE FEEDING AN ASSOCIATE MALNUTRITION. DISEASE AND REDUCED REPRODUCTION AND GROWTH AND LONGEVITY. SO DISTURBING THINGS JUST FROM ONE GROUP OF MARINE ANIMALS ALONE THOSE PAYING MARINE MAMMALS. SO AS A CABBIE OUT TO THE NEXT FOR IMAGES THAT I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU NOT BECAUSE OUR HORRIFIC BUT BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL. WHAT WE CALL CHARISMATIC MEGAFAUNA THESE ARE? THE BIG ANIMALS THAT GET OUR ATTENTION AND AND I WOULD ARGUE THAT -- THEY DO AS A SERVER SERVICE IN DOING THAT THEY THEY ARE ATTRACTIVE THEY ARE CONVERSATION STARTERS STATE TO ATTRACT THE IN IN GENDER AND ILLICIT. THE GOOD WILL OF PEOPLE IN AN INCREDIBLE WAY THIS IS THE WIND MONK SEAL IS ONE OF THE IMAGES THAT UPPER SHOWED. AS WELL ROLL ON THE BIG ISLAND BACK IN. TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN MANY STRESSES BASE THIS SPECIES ARE ONLY THIRTEEN ANIMALS THIRTEEN HUNDRED ANIMALS ALIVE IT'S EXTRAORDINARILY ENDANGERED SPECIES ONE OF THE THREATS IS IN FACT. MARINE DEBRIS. A WHALE SHARK -- SEEMINGLY IN THIS IMAGE ABOUT TO GOBBLED DOWN A PLASTIC BAG WITH A MARINE DEBRIS FLOATING ALL ABOUT ABOVE IT WHALE SHARKS IF YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH THEM ARE FILTER FEEDERS. THERE WERE MOVING THROUGH THE WATER UP AT THE SERVICE WERE A LOT OF THESE PLASTICS WILL AGGREGATE SO THEY'RE BASICALLY FILTERING IN AND TAKING IN POTENTIALLY A WHOLE LOT OF MARINE DEBRIS. PLASTICS PACIFIC LEAD. DOCTOR AL DOVE DOWN AT THE GEORGIA AQUARIUM IN ATLANTA TAKING CARE THE WHALE SHARKS IN THEIR CARE BUT HE'S ALSO DOING FIELD WORK EXTENSIVELY AROUND THE WORLD. GETTING BLOOD FROM WILD ANIMALS TRYING TO CORRELATE WHAT HE'S SEEING IN THOSE BLOOD SAMPLES WITH WHAT THEY ARE INGESTING FROM OTHER SAMPLES THAT THEIR OBTAINING. SEE TURTLES I I DIDN'T WANT TO PUT THE THE PHOTO OF THIS ETERNAL WITH THE STRAW IN ITS NOSE IN HERE. BY THAT BECAUSE I'M SURE YOU ALL SAW IT BUT YOU YOU YOU JUST GOOGLE SEA TURTLES PLASTIC AND IS PRETTY HORRIFYING WHAT YOU WHAT YOU SEE. DAY IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE CLASSIC -- CHALLENGE OF AN ANIMAL THAT FOR EONS HAS BEEN A HARD WIRED TO LOOK AT SOMETHING FLOATING IN THE WATER COLUMN. OF THE LOOK AND SHAPE OF A PLASTIC BAG AND THINK IT'S A SQUID IN GOBLET DOWN -- IMPACTED BY PLASTICS IN IN A SEVERE AND AND SIGNIFICANT WAY. AND THIS TOO IS IS NOT IMAGE THAT I THINK WOULD BE UNFAMILIAR TO YOU ALL -- CELEBRATED ISN'T THE RIGHT WORD A TORY THIS IS A BETTER WORD AT THE IMAGES THAT COME OUT OF THE NORTHWEST HAWAIIAN ISLANDS -- WHERE ALBATROSS OUR OUR WE WILL FOR THE IMPACT OF OF PLASTICS ON WILDLIFE I THINK IT WAS PART OF WHAT -- SPURRED -- DAVID ATTENBOROUGH TO TWO DECLARED THE THE IMMENSITY OF THE PROBLEM WITH PLASTICS A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO AS HE WAS CITING WHAT HE WAS WITNESSING WITH -- ALBATROSS IS COMING BACK TO TO PROVIDE LET'S DO OF THINGS LIKE THIS. TO THEIR CHECKS. SO MACRO PLASTICS MICRO PLASTICS AB HAVE BEEN -- DISCUSSED HERE THIS MORNING ALREADY. SENATOR STERN HAD ASKED THAT THE VERY VERY APPROPRIATE QUESTION OF WHERE IT IS THE SCIENCE IN AND MY MY COLLEAGUE I'M TO MY RIGHT MIGHT MAY HAVE MORE INFORMATION ON THIS. FROM WHERE I SIT THE THERE'S SO MUCH BETTER AND UNDERSTANDING OF THE IMPACT ON WILDLIFE FROM A MACRO. PERSPECTIVE. AND YET I I SAID IN AN ORGANIZATION WHERE WE SEE HUNDREDS OF ANIMALS EACH AND EVERY YEAR -- WE ARE INVESTIGATING THE DEATHS OF THOSE ANIMALS FOR THE PROXIMATE CAUSE. BUT WE HAVE IN FRONT OF US AS A STUDY RESOURCE A SAMPLE RESOURCE OF A AMEND CITY AND ORGANIZATIONS LIKE OURS THIS IS MY AND MY MY CHALLENGE MYSELF. NEED TO ALLY WITH OTHER INVESTIGATORS TO START UNDERSTANDING WHAT IS TRANSITING TO THE GUTS OF ANIMALS WHATEVER THEIR OTHER BECAUSE OF DISEASE MIGHT BE. AND HOW DO WE GET TO UNDERSTAND BEING THAT'S BEING ABSORBED BY THOSE ANIMALS. AND OR OTHER EFFECTS OF OF THEIR PRESENCE IT'S NOT WELL UNDERSTOOD FROM WHERE I SIT YET AND NOW. ANY ONE OF US WOULD SAY THIS CANNOT BE GOOD. SO PLASTICS IMPACT IN THIS IS IN CLOSING IN THE CONTEXT OF OTHER THREATS TO MARINE WILDLIFE THE THREATS ARE MANY TO MARINE WILDLIFE'S THE THE SAMPLE WE SEE IS SPECIFICALLY MARINE MAMMALS ON THE WEST COAST WHERE WE SEE. MALNUTRITION FACTS DISEASES CANCER EVEN [inaudible] AND YET. THE ISSUE OF PLASTICS IS ONE WHERE IT SEEMS. WE HAVE THE THE MOST CLEAR RESPONSIBILITY AND AND PERHAPS HAVE THE THE THE POLITICAL WILL BECAUSE OF THAT AND BECAUSE OF THE CHARISMA OF THESE ANIMALS. TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE SO -- THESE OTHER THESE OTHER ISSUES THAT WE FACE IN CARING FOR MARINE MAMMALS. ARE GOING TO OCCUR THERE IS ALWAYS GOING TO BE MALNUTRITION BASED ON THE AND THE DIVERSITY OF SEASONS IN THE PLENTY OR LACK OF FOOD. RESOURCES THERE'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE INFECTIOUS DISEASES THIS IS A MAN MADE ISSUE THAT WE INTRODUCED. WITHIN THE LAST -- HUNDRED PLUS YEARS WE OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO DO SOMETHING TO ADDRESS IT. AND I WILL CLOSE THEIR WITH A APPRECIATION FOR THE OPPORTUNITIES BIG REPORT THIS MORNING. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH TALK ABOUT REALLY FIRST YEAR THAT'S ALMOST. YEAH. ALMOST LESS THAN A HUNDRED YEARS AND IT'S REALLY EXTRAORDINARY THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK I NEWS -- FROM UPSTREAM WHICH SAID. SIX THIS PART INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS TO PLASTIC POLLUTION. FOR A THROW AWAY FREE WORLD. AND SHE'S HAD A CAREER LONG INTEREST IN REDUCING TOXICS AND POLLUTION. I SHE WAS FOR PREVIOUSLY -- CALPERS DIRECTOR FOR CLEAN WATER ACTION WHERE SHE PLAYED IMPORTANT ROLES IN THE LUNCH OF RETHINK DISPOSABLE WHICH IS HELPING FOOD SERVICE OPERATIONS. MOVED TO THROW A FREE OPERATIONS AND SO WERE VERY PRESERVE AFFIRMING YEAR AND HER EXPERTISE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NINE TEARS ALLEN AND STERN -- MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEES I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR PRIORITIZING THESE ISSUES -- AND HI I WANT TO TURN FROM THE BOMBER OF THE PROBLEM TOO I'M MORE OPTIMISTIC VIEW -- FOCUSING ON THE SOLUTIONS -- I'VE BEEN FOCUSING ON SOLUTIONS. AND HOW WE SOLVE THIS PROBLEM EVER SINCE -- WHEN I WAS WORKING AT THE CALIFORNIA CO I RAN INTO CAPTAIN CHARLES MOORE AFTER HIS FIRST DIRE JOURNEY INTO THE PACIFIC OCEAN -- AND FOUND AND HE SHOWED ME AS SAMPLES WHERE YOU FOUND SIX TIMES MORE PLASTIC THAN PLANKTON. ON THE SURFACE OF THE PACIFIC OCEAN AND EVER SINCE THEN THAT WAS LIFE CHANGING EXPERIENCE FOR ME AND EVER SINCE THEN I'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS ISSUE FOR THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS -- MOVING FROM THE STATE TO THE NGO COMMUNITY AND SEEKING SOLUTIONS ON I BEFORE I MOVED OVER -- TO TALKING ABOUT UNPLUGGING CALIFORNIA'S WHAT IS FROM PLASTIC ILLNESS SAY WE'VE BEEN FOCUSING A LOT TODAY ON THE PROBLEM IN THE MARINE ENVIRONMENT BUT THERE ARE QUESTIONS ABOUT HEALTH. AND I WON OFFERED THIS -- THIS ISN'T JUST A PROBLEM IN THE MARINE ENVIRONMENT PLASTICS SURRENDERING OUR FOOD CHAIN -- NOT JUST FROM SEAFOOD IT'S IN ALL MANY OTHER FOOD SOURCES IT'S IN THE AIR WE BREATHE IT'S IN OUR TOP WATER IT'S AN R. BOTTLED WATER -- AND SO -- IRVING TOWARDS FIGURING OUT HOW OLD THIS IS EFFECTING A PUBLIC HEALTH THERE'S ALSO HUNDREDS OF CHEMICALS -- THAT OUR ENDOCRINE DISRUPTORS AND CARCINOGENS IN PLASTICS AND IN FOOD PACKAGING TO THAT END UP STREAM IS CONVENING. AN INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE IN JUNE ON LAUNCHING TO SCIENTIFIC CONSENSUS STATEMENTS ABOUT THE HEALTH EFFECTS OF PLASTICS THEMSELVES AND MICRO AND NANO PLASTICS -- AS WELL AS FOOD PACKAGING CHEMICALS AND I WOULD BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE COMMITTEES ON ORGANIZING A PANEL ON THE HUMAN HEALTH EFFECTS OF FOOD PACKAGING CHEMICALS AND PLASTICS -- BUT TODAY WANT TO FOCUS MORE ON SOLUTIONS AND TO MACRO PLASTICS -- FIRST A LITTLE BIT ABOUT MY ORGANIZATION WE ARE -- WE'RE FOUNDED IN TWO THOUSAND AND THREE IS THE PRODUCT POLICY INSTITUTE WE FOCUSED ON WHAT W DO WITH PRODUCTS AT THE END OF THEIR USEFUL LIFE AND WE WERE PROMOTING EXTENDED PRODUCER RESPONSIBILITY FOR ALL KINDS OF PRODUCT CATEGORIES -- AND SUCCESSFULLY AND A HELP FOUND THE CALIFORNIA PRODUCT STEWARDSHIP COUNCIL AND HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN MANY EPR LAWS -- BUT WHEN WE GOT TO THE PLASTICS AND PACKAGING IT. HAS BECOME CLEAR TO US THAT IF MANAGEMENT APPROACH JUST DOESN'T REALLY -- IT'S NOT THE BEST APPROACH FOR PRODUCTS THAT WE USE IN A MATTER OF MINUTES AND THAT HAVE ENORMOUS ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT FROM THE EXTRACTION OF RESOURCES TO THEIR CARBON AND CLIMATE FOOTPRINT TO THEN THE TOXICS AND PLASTIC POLLUTION. THAT WE END UP WITH -- SO WE HAVE BEEN FOCUSING MORE ON HOW TO WE OF UPSTREAM LOOK AT THESE PRODUCTS AND DEVELOP BETTER POLICIES AND THAT ENTAILS -- REALLY CHANGING MARK THROWAWAY CULTURE. AND THAT'S WHERE WE ARE NOW SUGGESTING ARE HOW WE SOLVE THESE PROBLEMS -- LOOKING AT IT FROM A CALIFORNIA PERSPECTIVE WE REALLY ALL OF OUR SOLUTIONS SHOULD BE SCIENCE BASED AND GUIDED BY DATA AND SO THE BACK AS THE OPC LITTER STRATEGY ACKNOWLEDGES THE BEST DATA SET THAT WE HAVE IS THE DECADES WORTH OF CALIFORNIA COASTAL CLEANUP -- DATA AND FROM NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT TO TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE TOP TEN PRODUCTS ARE ARE LISTED HERE. AND YOU CAN SEE THAT CIGARETTE HAVE BEEN -- BUT SEVEN OUT OF THE TEN TOP PRODUCTS OR FOOD AND BEVERAGE PACKAGING RELATED -- AND SO WHAT DO WE REALLY NEED TO BE LOOKING AT THOSE PRODUCTS AS A WHOLE ALL RATHER THAN TRYING TO PICK OFF. ONE MEAN A ONE PRODUCT AT A TIME AND DEVELOPING MORE COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGIES I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT -- SO I'VE -- PUT IN READ ALL THAT ARE -- FOOD AND BEVERAGE RELATED -- I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT -- WHILE BAGS WERE NUMBER FOUR IN THAT TIME PERIOD AS OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN BAGS ARE NO LONGER IN THE TOP TEN AND THAT IS A DEMONSTRATION THAT THAT POLICY THAT WAS -- THAT EMERGE FROM THE GROUND UP THAT WAS STARTED IN SAN FRANCISCO IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN THE BAG. PLASTIC BAG BAN AND THE CHARGE THAT WORKS THAT SON YOU KNOW AS AS YOU ALL KNOW IT'S A STATEWIDE POLICY NOW -- AND AND THAT IS A GOOD CASE -- FOR HOW TRANSITIONING TO RE USE AND PREVENTION -- AND BANDS OFTEN ARE A VERY HELPFUL SOLUTION -- SO I WOULD SAY THAT WE NEED TO BE LOOKING AT THE STATUS THAT WE NEED TO PRIORITIZE CIGARETTE AND AND CAPS AS A SEPARATE ISSUE BECAUSE THERE'S A GOOD SOLUTION FOR THEM AND FOOD WHERE AS A GENERAL. ISSUE AND THEN MICRO FIBERS ARE NOT COUNTED OBVIOUSLY IN COASTAL CLEANUP BECAUSE THEY'RE TOO SMALL THEIR MICRO THANK YOU -- BUT THEY ARE THEY HAVE EMERGED AS ANOTHER VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE AREA WHERE WE NEED SOLUTIONS. SO AS WE CRAFT SOLUTIONS WHAT WHAT IS A FRAMEWORK FOR THINKING ABOUT THE BEST SOLUTIONS -- FOR THESE PRIORITY PRODUCTS AND LET ME SUGGEST THIS IS A FRAMEWORK THAT WAS ALSO -- REITERATED IN THE OCEAN LATER STRATEGY BECAUSE THERE'S GENERAL AGREEMENT AMONGST OF THE PLASTIC POLLUTION COMMUNITY AND THE REGULATORS ON THIS APPROACH. ON A VERY MUCH HAILS FROM MORE THREE OURS -- SOLID WASTE HIERARCHY THE IDEA THAT WE SHOULD REDUCE AND PREVENT AS MUCH OF THIS SINGLE USE THROW AWAY STUFF AS POSSIBLE AND THEN WORRY ABOUT -- AND THEN FIGURE OUT WHAT WE DO WITH THE REST OF IT. SO SOURCE REDUCTION OR PREVENTION STRATEGIES INCLUDE PRODUCT BANS. MINIMIZING SINGLE USE AND REUSE OR REDUCTION SORRY MESS THAT AND THEN -- SECOND THEN AFTER WE'VE DONE THAT AND THAT COULD INCLUDE THINGS LIKE MINIMIZING DISPOSABLE PACKAGING LIKE IN ASK FIRST POLICY FOR STRAWS OR REPLACING DISPOSABLES WITH REUSABLE AS AS ARE BAD -- POLICY HAS DONE AND AND CHARGING FOR CHARGING FOR PRODUCTS BUT FOR THOSE THAT WE CAN'T REDUCE THEN THERE ARE THE CONTROL MEASURES LIKE A GOOD WASTE MANAGEMENT INFRASTRUCTURE THAT LOOKS AT RECYCLING AND COMPOSTING AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. AND WHEN WE FOCUS ON DISPOSAL WE NEED -- TO TO HAVE BETTER GARBAGE MANAGEMENT TO PREVENT ILLEGAL DUMPING AND CONTROLLING -- THIS SCAPE OF TRASH FROM DUMPSTERS -- AND THEN THERE ARE OTHER CONTROL I WON'T GET INTO BUT LASTLY THERE AND THEN THERE'S A CLEAN UP LAKE STREET WELL ST LITTER CLEANING AND TRASH CAPTURE DEVICES IN THE STORM DRAIN. BUT THE REASON THAT THIS IS LAST LITTER CLEANUP AND TRASH CAPTURE IS BECAUSE EVERY TIME YOU CLEAN UP A BEACH OR CLEAN THE STREET A COUPLE HOURS LATER OR THE NEXT DAY IT'S RE LITTERED. SO WE'RE NOT REALLY SOLVING THE PROBLEM AND WERE PERPETUALLY SPENDING TAXPAYER DOLLARS TO CLEAN IT UP -- IRATE -- DEVER HAS ALLUDED TO ALREADY DISCUSSED SOME OF THE STATE ACTIONS -- SO I'M NOT GOING TO WE DO HAVE THE STATEWIDE -- STORM WATER REGULATIONS THE TRASH AMENDMENTS THE FOCUS ON THAT CONTROLLING CLEAN UP -- APPROACH -- AND W'VE ALSO HAD SOME GREAT LEGISLATION IN CALIFORNIA -- THE BAG BAN. WHEN FEE WHICH IS A SOURCE REDUCTION MEASURE MICROBEADS AND PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS WERE BANNED AGAIN ANOTHER PREVENTION APPROACH? THE STRAWS UPON REQUEST IS A PREVENTION APPROACH IT REDUCES CONSUMPTION AND SENATOR ALLEN'S -- FOOD WHERE LEGISLATION THAT REALLY ELIMINATES FOAM FOOD WHERE -- WHICH GETS US -- TO ANOTHER ELIMINATION APPROACH -- BUT WE STILL NEED TO ADDRESS THESE THE CIGARETTE FILTERS -- FOOD AND BEVERAGES LIKE THE WRAPS CONTAINERS CUPS PLATES UTENSILS AND BOTTLES. CAPS IN LEADS AND MICRO FIBERS. AND I WILL SAY THAT WE CAN LOOK TO LOCAL POLICY IN CALIFORNIA SOMETIMES OUR LOCAL. GOVERNMENT AND LOCAL COMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN LEADERS IN THE THINKING ON THIS -- FOR EXAMPLE THE PLASTIC BAG BAN ON THE FIRST ONE WAS IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN IN THE CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO. THE FIRST POLY STYRENE ORDINANCE WAS INTRODUCED BY SENATOR SKINNER IN THE CITY OF BERKLEY WAY BACK IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT OKAY THANK YOU. AND WE'VE HAD A LOT OF THE STRAW AND UTENSIL -- BANS BANS ON PLASTIC HAVE COME FROM THE LOCAL LEVEL TWO ITEMS THAT REALLY HAVEN'T BEEN -- WE REALLY HAVEN'T GOTTEN INTO STATE LEGISLATION YET OR FIGURE ARE -- SAN LUIS OBISPO AND CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO BANNED THE SALE OF PLASTIC WATER BOTTLES IN GOVERNMENT FACILITIES. AND BOTH SAN FRANCISCO AND OAKLAND HAVE ALSO ATTACH FEES TO CERTAIN -- TO LITTER ON LITTERING NO FOR THE CLEAN UP APPROACH BUT PERHAPS THE MOST -- GROUNDBREAKING RECENT LEGISLATION FROM -- LOCAL GOVERNMENT IS BERKELEY'S ORDINANCE -- WHICH I HOPE TO CRAFT -- IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN WHICH IS REALLY. REALLY GETTING OUT THE SOURCE REDUCTION APPROACH IT'S IS NO DISPOSABLES WILL BE USED FOR ON SITE DINING IMAGINE WALKING INTO A MCDONALD'S AND YOU CANNOT BE SERVED ON A DISPOSABLE CUPS PLATES AND UTENSILS. THIS IS WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE IN EUROPE THEY ACTUALLY HAVE IT SO IT'S REALLY NOT THAT I MEAN THEY ACTUALLY HAVE MAKE CAFES WHERE THERE ARE REUSABLE CUPS AND YOU CAN HAVE YOUR CAPPUCCINO AND CLASS ON ON A REAL. PLATE IN A REAL COP -- AT BERKELEY ALSO ATTACH A TWENTY FIVE CENT CHARGE ON TAKE OUT DISPOSABLE CUPS EMULATING THE BAG CHARGE SAYING THAT PEOPLE CAN BRING THEIR OWN. THEY ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT WE WANNA GET REUSABLE AS INTO FOOD WHERE BUT B. Y. O. IS. NOT A GOOD APPROACH SO THEY HOW ARE FUNDING -- HAVE FUNDING FOR THE REAR YOU TO GO AND GET A TAKE OUT. MEAL IN A REUSABLE PACKAGE THAT IS PROVIDED BY THE BY THE BUSINESS ITSELF. IT BANS A SOME OF THE WORST CHEMICALS IN FOOD WHERE FLUORINATED SUBSTANCES AND IT ALSO -- SAYS THAT ALL DISPOSABLES MUST BE COMPOSTABLE IN BERKELEY BUT ACTUALLY COMPOSTABLE NOT JUST CERTIFIED BUT IT ACTUALLY DOES BREAK DOWN IN BERKELEY'S COMPOST FACILITY. ON THIS IS A REALLY GOOD A MODEL AND WE ARE GOING TO SEE I THINK MORE AMBULATION OF THIS IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT IN CALIFORNIA -- UPSTREAM CONVENE TO A IN DECEMBER A WORKSHOP FOR BAY AREA ZERO WASTE AND STORM WATER PROGRAM OPERATORS AND THE CONCLUSION OF THAT WORKSHOP. THOSE LOCAL GOVERNMENT -- STAFF SAID TO US -- WE THINK THAT REALLY IS THAT WHAT WE NEED IS TO HAVE MORE POLICIES THAT FOCUS ON REDUCING DISPOSABLES. AND WE ALSO NEED THE INFRASTRUCTURE FOR RE USE A SO THEY ARE PRIORITIZING AND WORKING WITH US ON TRYING TO DEVELOP A REGIONAL REUSABLE CUP AND CONTAINER PROGRAM IN THE BAY AREA. SO THAT INSTEAD OF US CONSUMER A WHOLE BACKPACK FULL OF REUSABLE PRODUCTS THAT THEY WILL BE AVAILABLE ON DEPOSIT WHEN YOU GO TO TAKE OUT. YOUR COFFEE OR TAKE OUT A MEAL -- SO I THINK THESE ARE THE KINDS OF INNOVATIVE APPROACHES THAT WE NEED AND I ALSO WANT TO SAY THAT IT CAN BE EXTREMELY GOOD FOR BUSINESS I AM THE HI I WHEN I WAS A EXECUTIVES. THE DIRECTOR OF CLEAN WATER ACTION CALIFORNIA I CREATED THE RETHINK DISPOSABLE PROGRAM. THAT DEBORAH WAS TALKING ABOUT IN ALAMEDA AND THAT PROGRAMS WORK TO A THREE HUNDRED BUSINESSES SO FAR -- ON VOLUNTARILY REDUCING SINGLE USE AND EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM SAVE MONEY. BY DOING THINGS LIKE -- THE UNIVERSITY SAN FRANCISCO DID IN THEIR CAFE REPLACING DISPOSABLES WITH REUSABLE IS AND JUST REDUCING SINGLE USE AND I'LL JUST SAY IT CAN HAVE ENORMOUS FINANCIAL BENEFITS THAT -- CAFETERIA IS SAVING NOW A HUNDRED AND FIFTY SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR AFTER THEIR OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE AND SET UP COSTS ARE ACCOUNTED. FOR TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND POUNDS AWAY POINT SIX MILLION DISPOSABLE ITEMS REDUCE PER YEAR. AND A CARBON REDUCTION OF TEN METRIC TONS PER YEAR SO THIS KIND OF SOLUTION CAN MAKE REALLY GOOD FINANCIAL CENTS FOR BUSINESSES. THANK YOU. THANK YOU GREAT GREAT GOOD WORK AND AND CERTAINLY OF A HINT OF OPTIMISM IN A A HEARING THAT IT'S BEEN A LITTLE A LITTLE DEPRESSING. SO LET ME -- OPEN UP THE FLOOR TO QUESTIONS THOUGHTS. COMMENTS FROM THE THE MEMBERS. WERE A LITTLE -- YAHIA APPRECIATE THAT BECAUSE IT'S HARD TO LOOK AT WHAT WE IS PEOPLE OF DONE TO UNDERMINE THE HEALTH OF OUR SISTER AND BROTHER. MEMBERS OF THE PLANET -- BUT AS FAR AS CLEARLY THERE ARE THINGS WE CAN DO AND I APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT. THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF BERKELEY FREQUENTLY TAKES THE LEAD ON THESE THINGS -- BUT IS OFTEN ISOLATED BECAUSE IT'S VIEWED AS BEING SOME KIND OF LEFT THE WHO KNOWS WHAT. EXPLANATION FOR HOW WE RESOLVE OUR PROBLEMS I'M WONDERING ARE THERE ANY STATISTICS TO DEMONSTRATE NOT JUST THAT IT'S GOOD FOR THE PLANET. BUT THAT -- THERE ARE BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES SOME OF OUR FRIENDS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE AND PERHAPS EVEN IN OUR OWN. PARTY OF WANNA KNOW WHAT THE WHAT THE PROFIT. OR LOSS IS GOING TO BE FOR A BUSINESS OR FOR COMMUNITY IN TERMS OF DOLLARS. FOR IT -- TRYING THESE OTHER TO GET RID OF PLASTICS TO GET RID OF OF THESE KINDS OF MATERIALS THAT ARE CREATING THE THE WAY. THE WASTE IN THE GARBAGE THAT'S PERMEATING OUR OUR WORLD TODAY. DO YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS ON WELL I CAN I CAN GIVE YOU SOME STATISTICS A BIT OF FEEDBACK FROM THE RETHINK DISPOSABLE PROGRAM -- SO WORKING WITH OF TO THE INDEPENDENT SORT OF MOM AND POP FOOD BUSINESS BRICK AND MORTAR. OF FOOD SERVICE OPERATOR IS SAVING ANYWHERE FROM TWO TO TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR JUST THROUGH VOLUNTARILY -- REDUCING SINGLE USE AND THEN -- I GAVE YOU AN EXAMPLE OF AN AN INSTITUTIONAL CASE STUDY THE UNIVERSITY OF SAN FRANCISCO -- YOU KNOW SAVING. A HUNDRED AND TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR SO -- I THINK I THINK THE POINT I WANT TO MAKE IS THAT MOST FOOD THE FOOD SERVICE INDUSTRY DOES NOT UNDERSTAND HOW MUCH MONEY THEY'RE SPENDING ON DISPOSABLES. OF ERROR IT'S VERY CONVENIENT TO USE DISPOSABLES AND EVERYONE THINKS THAT RE USE SWITCHING BACK TO WHAT SOME OF US. SOME OF US IN CERTAIN GENERATIONS REMEMBER AS THE WAY WE USED TO GET OUR FOOD SERVED IN SCHOOL ON REAL PLAYED SOME REAL. CUPS -- AND THE WAY WE USED TO BE SIR DONALD CREATED THE THE TO THE TRASH FILLED ME ALL THAT'S CALLED FAST FOOD -- THAT -- PEOPLE THINK THAT GOING BACK TO DISH WASHING AND GOING BACK TO RE USE IS GOING TO COST A LOT OF MONEY. BUT I SET OUT TO INVESTIGATE THAT WHEN I SET UP REFILL DISPOSABLE AND PROGRAM HAS PROVEN THAT ACTUALLY GOING BACK TO RE USE AND BEING. MINDFUL ABOUT HOW WE CAN MINIMIZE PACKAGING SAVES BUSINESSES MONEY. I THINK THAT WOULD BE IMPORTANT INFORMATION TO PROVIDE US OF FOR THOSE WHO. A NOT NECESSARILY MOVE BY JUST OUR LACK OF CARING AND RESPONSIBILITY. FOR GOD'S OTHER CREATURES -- AND AND FOR OUR OWN HEALTH. THE THAT EXISTS WITH SOME OF THESE MICRO FIBERS AS WELL AS JUST PLASTICS HAVING A AN OIL PETROLEUM BASED TO THEM -- IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO TO BE ABLE TO PUT INTO DOLLARS AND CENTS WHAT THE WHAT THE COST IS AND HOW THERE IS A POTENTIALLY A MUCH GREATER SAVINGS WE USE -- POTENTIALS CAN I JUST ADD ONE MORE THOUGHT I SAW SENATOR HOLE HOLDING UP THE COMPOSTABLE CUP YEAH WHEN. WHAT'S YOUR QUESTION I MAY AND I KNOW THAT THANK YOU. WHICH IT YOU MENTIONED AND I WAS WATCHING YOUR PRESENTATION IN THE OTHER ROOM THE THE ISSUE OF RECYCLABLE OR DISPOSABLE BUT NOT REALLY DISPOSABLE THEY DON'T WHY THEY DON'T.% AND A FOLLOW THE THAT THE NORMAL TRACK FOR THIS IN THIS ONE SAYS COMBUSTIBLE A COMPOSED OF FULL. EXAMPLE A BOTTLE YOU GOT A PROBLEM IS THAT IS WHAT WOULD MADE FROM CORN AND IT SURE LOOKS LIKE PLASTIC TO ME BUT IS THIS SOMETHING THAT IS. COMBUSTIBLE. THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION -- FIRST WELL I JUST WANT TO SAY TO TO PUT THAT IN THE CONTEXT OF ECONOMICS. THESE ARE MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE AND THE RESULT OF OUR PHONE BANS -- WELL THAT'S GOOD FOR THE MARINE ENVIRONMENT GETTING FOAM OUT OF THE ENVIRONMENT IS REALLY GOOD FOR THE FOR THE SPEAKER SYSTEM -- IT'S TURN IT IS OR HAVE TO BEAT MOSTLY OF TO BE RECYCLABLE OR COMPOSTABLE AND THAT'S ABOUT. A TEN TIMES THE COST OF WHAT IS REPLACING SO WE'RE DRIVING UP COSTS FOR FOOD BUSINESSES -- THESE THINGS HAVE TO BE CERTIFIED AS COMPOSTABLE PLASTICS THAT ARE. THAT CLAIM TO BE COMPOSTABLE COURTING A CALIFORNIA LAW HAVE TO BE HAVE TO HAVE CERTIFICATION -- AND SO THEY MAY BE TECHNICALLY COMPOSTABLE IN. A LABORATORY SETTING BUT WHAT WE ARE HEARING FROM THE COM POSTERS IS -- AND I'M TALKING TO THEM IN ALAMEDA COUNTY AND MARIN COUNTY WE HAD THE OREGON COMPOST OR IS AS A WHOLE GROUP CAME OUT WITH THE STATEMENT THAT. A LOT OF THIS BIO PLASTICS STUFF THAT'S MADE FROM CORN AND OTHER AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS WHILE IT IS PLASTIC. IS NOT ACTUALLY DEGRADING IN MANY COMPOST COMMERCIAL COMPOST FACILITIES AND SO IT ENDS UP GETTING IT ENDS UP EITHER CONTAMINATING THE GOOD ORGANIC COMPOST. OR IT ENDS UP JUST BEING SCREEN END OR IT ENDS UP BEING SCREENED OUT AND SENT TO LANDFILL ANYWAY SO THE PROBLEMATIC PRODUCTS HAVE BEEN. ON THE CUP BIO COPS BIO BAGS THE UTENSILS AND THE BIO PLASTIC FOOD CONTAINERS -- THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT HEY THAT MANY OF THEM NOT ALL OF THEM BUT MANY OF THEM ARE TELLING US JUST THEY'RE JUST ACTUALLY NOT TO GRADING IN THE REAL WORLD SETTING. SO EITHER HAVE TO BE DESIGNED BETTER OR WE NEED TO FOCUS MORE ON WE USE LAST QUESTION IF I MAY. SO IF -- IF WE REALLY WANT A LOT OF PEOPLE REALLY WOULD LIKE TO PARTICIPATE AND I SUSPECT THAT'S THE REASON THAT WE WENT TO THESE DIFFERENT KINDS OF OF A CUP SAID APPARENTLY ARE NOT ANY BETTER. OR IT MORE EXPENSIVE FOR THE STATE NOT ANY BETTER FOR THE THE ENVIRONMENT -- ARE THERE -- PLACES TO GO WHERE WE CAN. YOU KNOW MAKE THOSE CONSUMER BASE DECISIONS BASED UPON ACTUAL FACTS ABOUT PRODUCTS THAT. WE CAN REUSE AND AND RECYCLE THAT ARE GOING TO BE. ACHIEVING THE GOALS THAT WE WANT THEM TO ACHIEVE DO WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING LEGISLATIVELY ON THAT I MEAN OTHERWISE. IF I COULD TAKE A LOOK AT THAT IT TO IT HAS ALL SORTS OF GOOD STUFF ON IT GREEN STRIPE BY EAGLE PRODUCTS AND THERE'S A BIG EGO THING ON HERE I MEAN. I THINK MANY OF US USUALLY ISN'T THINK WE'RE DOING A GOOD SERVICE BUT WE'RE NOT SO WHAT DO WE DO TO TRY TO PUT US BACK ON THE RIGHT PATH. GIVE ME TAKE. WELL. I MEAN I THINK IF WERE. IT'S ONE THING TO GET CERTAIN IT'S ONE THING TO HAVE SOMETHING THAT WORKS IN A LABORATORY SETTING BUT AS I SAID WE NEED PRODUCTS THAT WORK IN A REAL WORLD SETTING SO I THINK WE NEED TO GO BACK. WE NEED TO INVOLVE THE CALM POSTERS IN I AM LOOKING AT THOSE STANDARDS AND AND THE BUT MY OWN PERSONAL FEELING FRANKLY IS THAT. THE AG THAT. GROWING CORN AND GROWING AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS CAN BE JUST AS HARMFUL AS EXTRACTING PETROLEUM. I MEAN IT REQUIRES A HUGE AMOUNT OF FERTILIZER ENERGY WATER AND TRANSITIONING ALL THAT PLASTIC TO OUR AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS WILL HAVE ENORMOUS CLIMATE IMPACTS AND WATER IMPACTS AS WELL. SO WHILE I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT FOR US TO DEVELOP COMPOSTABLE PRODUCTS THAT REALLY COMPOSTING CALIFORNIA. I THINK WE ALSO NEED TO BE PLACING. REALLY FOCUSING EVEN MORE SERIOUSLY ON TRANSITIONING AWAY FROM THROW AWAY FOR THROWAWAY PRODUCTS. AND WE NEED POLICIES THAT MAKE MANDATES. THAT WE REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF SINGLE USE PACKAGING OVERALL IN CALIFORNIA BY CERTAIN PERCENT KIND OF THE WAY WE HAVE ADDRESS CARBON. IF I COULD. BUILT ON AN ANSWER JUST BRIEFLY THE THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES TIED TYING THOSE POTENTIALLY BACK TO MARINE -- WILDLIFE HELP IN TAKING THIS CONSIDERATION OF LEANING ON AGRICULTURE AS AS A RESOURCE FOR FOR PRODUCTS LIKE THESE. I WAS TALKING TO ABOUT MARINE TO BREEZE IMPACT ON MARINE MAMMALS HARMFUL ALGAL BLOOMS ARE VERY REAL THING THAT HAVE I'M SURE THIS IS -- AND HE'S COMMITTEES ARE AWARE OF FUELING IN THE GROWTH OF THOSE ALLERGY. IS AFFLUENT FROM AGRICULTURE IS WARMING WATERS SO THE SO SHIFTING. FROM ONE PROBLEM TO SEE A SEEMING SOLUTION FROM WHERE I SIT AS I LOOK AT THE IMPACT ON WILDLIFE COULD JUST BE. ROBBING PETER TO PAY PAUL OR OFFSETTING ONE TO TO THE DETRIMENT OF THE OTHER. YES THOUGH I MEAN I GUESS THE WELL THE END OF THE DAY IT'S ALL ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT THE PRODUCTS ARE TRULY COMBUSTIBLE. SO IT'S NOT IT'S NOT A MATTER OF AND I I TOTALLY AGREE WITH YOU THAT WE NEED TO REDUCE WASTE. I AND REDUCE OUR RELIANCE ON SINGLE USE BUT I DID THIS IS THIS IT THERE'S THERE'S NOTHING. IF IF WE IF WE ACTUALLY I I I I GUESS I'LL ALL TO STICK ON YOUR COMMENT ABOUT ABOUT HOW WE NEED TO MAKE YOU'RE RIGHT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THIS IS NOT JUST ABOUT -- LAB TESTING BUT THE REAL TESTING OF PRODUCTS THERE ARE SOME PRODUCTS OUT THERE THAT ARE TRULY COMPOSTABLE AND AND AND TO THE EXTENT THAT FOLKS ARE STILL GONNA RELY ON SINGLE USE WHICH I AGREE WE OUGHT TO START TO SHIFT BEHAVIOR EARLY -- WE OUGHT TO BE DOING MORE AND MORE AS AS MUCH AS WE CAN TO SHIFT FOCUS ON THE PRODUCTS THAT ARE. THAT ARE TRULY IMPOSSIBLE YEAH I MEAN LIKE THE FIBER WHERE IS IS COMPOSTABLE IT'S TRULY COMPOSTABLE WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT IT ISN'T LINED WITH PERFORM NATIVE CHEMICALS AS A LOT OF IT HAS BEEN FOUND TO BE YOU KNOW THE SHINY. RESIN COATING SHOULDN'T HAVE P. FASTEN IT BUT I MEAN THAT STUFF IS TRULY COMPOST OF BURRS. YEAH BUT I I THINK YEAH THESE PRODUCTS I MEAN THERE THERE THERE'S THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT THEY ARE. THEY ARE ABSOLUTELY NOT AS GOOD AS USING A REUSABLE -- BUT THEY'RE ALSO BETTER THAN -- THE OTHER PRODUCTS THAT ARE THE THE MOST PEOPLE USE THOUGH CLEARLY ON IN THE CASE OF THIS PARTICULAR COMPANY -- TO WE WE NEED TO DO BETTER I'M I I WILL SAY I KNOW THAT IT'S YEAH WE ACTUALLY HAVE THESE HAVE MY WEDDING AND THEY MELTED IN THE SIDE SO THEY THEY SO THEY ARE CORN I SUPPOSE. OKAY -- ADD CENTER SKINNER. AND THANK YOU -- THANK YOU FOR HOLDING THIS. INFORMATIONAL HEARING BECAUSE IT'S JUST RORY. VALUABLE FOR US TO STEP BACK AND THINK ABOUT THE ENORMITY OF THE ISSUE AND I DON'T MEAN TO SAY THAT. TO MAKE US JUST WANT TO BURY YOUR HEAD IN THE SAND BUT BUT TO STEP BACK AND THINK ABOUT THE VARIOUS -- EFFORTS WE'VE MADE OVER TIME IN CALIFORNIA BACK IN NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE PASSED AB NINE THIRTY NINE WHICH WHERE WE WERE ONE OF THE FIRST STATES TO SET A RECYCLING GOAL AND WHILE THAT'S BEEN TALKED ABOUT A LITTLE LESS TODAY. WE WE DID THAT BECAUSE WE WERE THEN IN A LANDFILL CRISIS AND WE SAW THAT THE AMOUNT OF WASTE PER PERSON WAS GROWING AND WE FELT LIKE OKAY WE REALLY NEED TO DEAL WITH THIS. AND WE SHOULD BE PROMOTING% RECYCLING FOR LOTS OF ENERGY EFFICIENCY MEANS AND WE PROBABLY WEREN'T THINKING AS MUCH AROUND. OUR CARBONAND GREENHOUSE GASES BUT WE WERE THINKING A LITTLE BIT ABOUT MARINE WAY STE. BUT NOW WE COME TO THE POINT WHERE. WELL FIRST OFF WE'VE GOTTEN SO ON ONE THERE'S A COMPLETE MYTH THAT IF SOMETHING'S PICKED UP WHERE YOU PUT IT IN A RECYCLING BIN THAT MEANS IT'S RECYCLED THAT'S A COMPLETE MESS. IT'S NOT. THAT'S COLLECTION. SO TO BE. TO ACTUALLY BE RECYCLED IT HAS TO BE REMADE INTO A NOTHER PRODUCT. AND WHAT'S HAPPENED NOW IS VERY LITTLE OF THAT WHICH WE ARE COLLECTING IS BEING MADE INTO WHAT ANOTHER PRODUCT PARTLY DUE. TO WE HAVE MUCH LESS -- MANUFACTURING IN UNITED STATES OR CALIFORNIA THAT USES ANY OF THIS MATERIAL IN REMANUFACTURE SO THERE ARE STILL SOME BUT MUCH LESS. AND WE SEND IT ALL. TO CHINA AND ELSEWHERE WHO NO LONGER WANTS OUR MATERIALS SO A LOT OF THE FOCUS WHEN WE READ OUR BACKGROUND MATERIALS IT TALKS ABOUT. WE ARE WHAT'S CALLED WHAT'S WORD WHERE THEY CAUGHT. NATIONAL SORTS SORRY SORRY SORRY SO IN THIS FOCUS ON CONTAMINATED -- BUNDLES MEANING -- THE WHEN THE PROCESSING FACILITY -- PREPARES -- THE THE BAIL TO SELL OR TO SEND TO CHINA IT NOW CHINA'S LOOKING MORE CLOSELY AND WHETHER OUR MATERIAL IS CONTAMINATED. BUT REALLY BOTTOM LINE IS. AS OTHER COUNTRIES BEGIN TO PRODUCE THE AMOUNT OF WASTE PER PERSON THAT WE DO THEY DON'T WONDER DRUG THEY DON'T NEED IT THEY HAVE THEIR OWN. AND SO IF WHATEVER INFRASTRUCTURE THEY HAVE FOR REMANUFACTURING THEY'RE GOING TO USE THEIR OWN. TRASH NOT OURS. THEY DON'T WANT OURS SO WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO WITH OUR IT COMES BACK TO IS. THE ONLY WAY WE'RE GOING TO PROTECT OUR OCEANS. AND YOUR THE FACT THAT. THERE'S IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO ADEQUATELY REMANUFACTURE. ALL OF THIS STUFF THAT WE USE NOW. IS TO DROP ARE SINGLE USE PRODUCTS. AND THEN WITHIN THAT SINGLE USE WHATEVER STILL HAS TO REMAIN. TO HAVE IT EITHER COMPOSED BOTH BECAUSE THAT IS BETTER I MEAN IT IS. OR OR FAR LESS BALL YOU LIKE HOW CAN IT IT'S LIKE NOW. WE KNOW THAT CARS FOR EXAMPLE. WAY FAR LESS AND THEY WAY FAR LESS BECAUSE THE MATERIALS WE USE FOR THEM IT'S LESS MATERIAL. FOR THE SAME PURPOSE SO WHATEVER SINGLE USE WE'RE GONNA USE HAS TO BE LESS MATERIAL AND THEN BUT WE JUST HAVE TO USE WAY LESS SINGLE USE [inaudible] AND WE'RE GOING TO GET TO YOUR BILL ABOUT THAT LATER WHICH IS GREAT BUT ANYWAY I I APPRECIATE. THE DATA YOU PRESENTED TO US AND I APPRECIATE THE PREVIOUS PANEL AND THE FOCUS ON OUR SEALS ARE WHALES. ARE -- DIFFERENT MARINE LIFE BUT I THINK REALLY INDEPENDENT OF WHETHER AND I I DON'T MEAN TO SAY THIS IN ANY KIND OF CALLOUS WAY BUT INDEPENDENT OF WHETHER WE FEEL MOVED BY. PROTECTING ONE SPECIES OR ANOTHER THE REALITY IS WE ARE BASICALLY DROWN IN OURSELVES IN. THIS SINGLE USE MATERIAL. AND IT IS FAR MORE THAN PACKAGING THOUGH CERTAINLY HAS POINTED OUT 40% OF IT IS. SO WE REALLY IT'S JUST. AS AS MUCH AS WE REALIZED BACK IN EIGHTY NINE IN A FEW YEARS AFTER THAT WE HAD TO FOCUS ON NOW WE HAVE TO EMBRACE AND REALIZE WE HAVE TO FOCUS ON SOURCE REDUCTION [inaudible] YEAH NINE COULD NOT AGREE MORE OKAY REALLY DO APPRECIATE YOUR PRESENTATION -- VERY VERY HELPFUL AND STICK AROUND BECAUSE WE'LL BE HAVING MORE DISCUSS COULD YOU FIX IT. ALRIGHT I WANT TO ASK TO I WANT TO CALL THE DISS -- AND CONSUL GENERAL. ADDRESS LONERS GONNA GIVE US A BRIEF. PRESENTATION -- FROM INTERNATIONAL EXAMPLE -- HIGHLIGHTING THE WORK TO THE CITY OF VIENNA HAS ENGAGED IN WITH THE GRASS TO WASTE REDUCTION I THOUGHT WOULD BE HELPFUL -- IN THE CONTEXT OF OUR DISCUSSION AND AND THEN WE'LL GO ON GO STRAIGHT INTO PUBLIC COMMENT. RIGHT THANK YOU VERY WELCOME MISTER BECAUSE GENERAL. SO MISTER CHAIRMAN IT'S YES AND IT IS IT'S IT'S A GREAT PLEASURE TO BE HERE WITH YOU TODAY -- I'M I FEEL VERY ON THAT I HAVE. TO APOLOGIZE IN ADVANCE -- SO AT THIS IS BE BASED CONTINUES RIGHT SO WE OF OF SAID I'VE AND IT'S SENATE THAT BEN AND JUST LAST FRIDAY AND THE SHOW THEN THE MEDIATION SO I HAVE TO ADD LIVE RIGHT. AB AND OF COURSE I'M NOT SUCH AN EXPERTISE IN I'M JUST A DIPLOMAT SO I'M NOT AN EXPERT IN. ENVIRONMENTAL POLICIES SUCH AS YOU ARE SO PLEASE APOLOGIZE AND IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS I SHOULD BE ABLE TO ANSWER AND THERE WILL BE A FEW. I WOULD BE HAPPY TO GET BACK TO YOU AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. I'M SO ADAM I AM VERY HAPPY TO BE HERE -- OUT WE OF COURSE ME AS A AS AUSTRIA AND AND I THINK ALL EUROPEANS REALLY HIGHLY APPRECIATE THE FUNDAMENTAL ROLE THAT CALIFORNIA'S PLAYING. AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION I THINK IT'S SO IMPORTANT THAT YOU'VE TAKEN OVER LEADING ROLE -- HE IN THE UNITED STATES AND OF COURSE -- VIA THE SPECIALLY ABBOTT EXPERIENCE WOULD BE DELAYED THERE ABOUT YOU KNOW THE SPECIAL CONNECTION BETWEEN CALIFORNIAN OSTRANDER THE AREA. WE ARE VERY HAPPY AND WOULD JUST LIKE TO OFFER -- FOR OUR SERVICES IN THOUGH COOPERATE INTERNATIONAL TO GATHER AND IT'S NOT THAT WE ALWAYS HAVE. TO REINVENT THE WHEEL AND YOU'LL RIGHTS SO WE ALSO WORK WITH OTHER COUNTRIES AT THE CAPITOL IS WE HAVE TO GATHER SO AT IT THAT THERE'S A LOT OF INTERNATIONAL XP AS AN EXCHANGE IN THAT AREA. IS CERTAIN THE OFF OFFICE OF THE ESSENCE SO -- AUSTRIA'S SUCH AS BE IN -- EN ENVIRONMENTALLY VERY ACT KIND OF CONSCIOUS COUNTRY FOR A VERY LONG TIME. SO -- MET MUCH OF THE LEGISLATION THAT THE POLICIES. FUNDAMENTAL POLICIES GO BACK TO THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES IN THE IN THE IN IN THIS FIELD -- AND I I THINK THAT THE REASON IS QUITE THE SAME IN ALL AT JUSTICE CALIFORNIA'S RIGHT SO WELL I WAS JUST REALLY FEEL VERY MUCH ATTACHED. TO THE NATURE RIGHT IT'S IT'S LIKE IN CALIFORNIA IT'S IT'S POD VERY IMPORTANT PART OF THE NATIONAL IDENTITY SO WE GIVE RUN OUT OF BEACHES SINCE. NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE AB SO I OTHERWISE WE LOVE OUR MOUNTAINS. LAKES WITH. WE LOVE OUR RIVAS OB PLAYS RIGHT -- SO IT IS KIND OF DOES A CLOSE CONNECTION OF OF OFT OFFICE YOU KNOW FOSTER IS TO TO NATURE ACTIONS. BY HAS BE HAVE BEEN. VERY MUCH INTERNALIZED BY THE POPULATION BY THE POLITICIANS BUT ALSO BY THE PRIVATE SECTOR BY BUSINESSES AND THIS IS. WHAT I THINK -- MAIDS ARE STILL ONE OF THE LEADING COUNTRIES. IN EUROPE IF NOT IN THE VOTE IN THE IN THE IN THE FIELD OF OF OF CLEAN TECHNOLOGIES -- ENDS AND ALSO ON THE POLICY SIDE IN IN IN IN TERMS OF POLICY. AB IMPLEMENTATION SO -- THAT BEING SAID I HAVE TO SAY WE ARE FAR FROM PERFECT RED RIVER Là THE PHONE BACK TO MAY TO DO JUST ON THE FLY TIAS ADD TO SACRAMENTO I READ. A RECENT REPORT BY MINISTRY OF THE ENVIRONMENT WHICH WAS QUITE SELF CRITICAL RIGHT I MEAN THERE COULD YOU AS YOU KNOW WE HAVE WAY AMBITIOUS GOALS SET BY THE EUROPEAN UNION ACTUALLY UNTIL NEXT YEAR. TWENTY TWENTY AT THE OUT IN THIS REPORT INTERIM REPORT THAT KIND OF GOOD NEWS AND BAD NEWS THE GOOD NEWS FOR INSTANCE IS -- ENERGY EFFICIENCY IN AUSTRIA HAS INCREASED DRAMATICALLY RAY POSITIVE RIGHT -- AT THE SAME TIME -- THE EMBASSY BECAUSE THE ENERGY CONSUMPTION THIS IS PROBABLY BAD RIGHT. THEN -- IT'S POSITIVE AT THAT THE ENERGY MAKES IN AUSTRIA IS IS QUITE GOOD SO WE HAVE. APPROXIMATELY -- THIRTY FIFTH 53% CURRENTLY AT RENEWABLE ENERGY IN THE OF A ROLL OF OF ENERGY CONSUMPTION. AND ELECTRICITY 60% OF BY HIGH TO APOLLO RIGHT SO THIS IS GOOD MMHM. OUT BAD GREENHOUSE GASES HAVE BEEN GOING UP. IN AUSTRIA AS WELL AND THAT'S ALSO BECAUSE OF HEAVY TRAFFIC SO AUSTRIAN ALWAYS REALLY AT THE CENTER OF EUROPE SO WE HAVE. NO SALAS WEST EAST RIGHT SO -- SO THERE ARE MANY FACTORS WE WE CAN'T REALLY IMPLANTS ALSO RIGHT SO WE HAVE TO BE VERY HUMBLE RIGHT -- THERE'S NO REASON TO BRAG ABOUT THE ANYTHING. ABOUT THE DEBT BEING SAD -- I I BELIEVE THAT AUSTRIA IS IN COUNTIES ARE REALLY INTERESTING PATTON IS TO WORK WITH AND IF YOU ALLOW YOU MENTIONED THE CITY OF VIENNA RIGHT. I'M A STILL I WILL FOCUS ON ON ON ON ON THE END THAT THIS SEEMS MAYBE A LITTLE BIT ALL BECAUSE BECAUSE YOU I'M I'M IN THE STATE SENATE. AB PADS ON THE ONE HAND I BELIEVE DEBT. AB ALL THE CHALLENGES IN THIS AREA WE HAVE WE HAVE TO TACKLE THEM PRIMARILY IN THE CITY'S RIGHTS WE AGREE ON THAT. AND THEN A GIVEN YOU KNOW THE DENSELY POPULATED REAS IN -- IN THE IN THE IN THE WEST OFF OF CALIFORNIA RIGHT IT'S IF IF THE ESEE THESE ARE NOT RIGHT BUT IT'S IT'S A IT'S A HUGE ONE OF THE HUGEST. URBAN AND SUBURBAN ADMIRATION INTO VOTES RIGHT AND I I THINK IT'S INTERESTING FOR CALIFORNIA TO LOOK AT THE EXPERIENCE. OF OF CITIES. A SOVIET MAYES IS IS QUITE AN INTERESTING EXAMPLE BECAUSE OF COURSE WE ARE MAYES IS QUITE WELL KNOWN YOU KNOW BECAUSE OF ITS HISTORY UNITED WHISKEY. FOR FIVE ON THE G. IS THE CAPITAL OF THE HAPSBURG EMPIRE YOUTH IS A GREAT CULTURAL HERITAGE GREAT CULTURAL LIFE MISS REALIZING. CONTEMPORARY -- CENTURY EUROPEAN CD VERY INTERNATIONAL. I'M BAD AT ALL BE IN AS ALSO RECEIVED BY LAW THE FIFTH DIMENSION. IN THE LAST DECADE -- UP AS A MODEL OF URBAN DEVELOPMENT. ABBAS SO. ALL RIGHT FROM THE SERVER REVISION NICE. BETTER THAN MY DOG ACTUALLY I LIVE RIGHT. IT'S THE FIRM FOR ITS ITS ON THE MAJOR RIGHT NOW. LOS DISCORD TO MY PRESENTATION RIGHT THAT'S GAINES NOT. ARRIVE VIA THE SO. SO IT HAS REACHED IS THE IF THE LOT OF INTERNATIONAL ATTENTION BECAUSE IT LEADS MANY RANKINGS FOR INSTANCE IN THE AREA OF LIVE ABILITIES WITH ECONOMIST. HAS RANKED THE ON THE FIRST -- IN THE MELISSA -- A AND ALSO BY THE UNITED NATIONS IT SETS WERE AND AT THE HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN MANY STUDIES MADE ON THESE STUDIES YOU KNOW WHY IS IT THAT THE CITY LIKE ME AND THAT IS -- SO SUCCESSFUL IN LEADING AND THE INTERESTING THING IS -- IF IT IS A LOT POOREST ON NOT ALL RIGHTS ALSO V. N. AS QUITE IN THE LONG TRADITION OF SOCIAL POLICIES ITS ADDRESS. BUT A LOT OF DEAD BOYS DOWN -- TO AT THE CUTTING EDGE. INVASIVE FIFTY K. THE POLICIES AND AND TECHNOLOGIES AND IF YOU'LL LOOK EVEN DEEPER YOU KNOW IT'S A LOT ABOUT SCREEN TECHNOLOGIES AT THE END OF THE DAY RIGHT SO A LOT OF THESE TECHNOLOGIES. I NOT ONLY GOOD FOR THE QUALITY OF LIVING BUT THEY ALSO ALSO COULD FIND VIOLENCE RIGHT THAT THAT'S I THINK THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S QUITE AN INTERESTING MESSAGE. AND ADAM. IT'S IMPORTANT -- TO TO MENTION DAD'S VIANA HAS BECOME A KIND OF A LAB. FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CITIES OF THE FUTURE RIGHT IT'S IT'S IT'S WAS WAS VERY SPECIFIC UP ABOUT TO BE ON THE IS. THAT THE CITY ADMINISTRATION IS WORKING WITH UNIVERSITIES RESEARCH INSTITUTIONS ALSO THE PRIVATE SECTOR PEAK INTERNATIONAL CORPORATIONS TO CHAS IT'S A CHEST AND OF THE SIGN IN. AND OUT TO WORK OUT WHAT COULD THE FUTURE OF THE CITY'S BE HOW COULD WE MAKE OUR CD SUSTAINABLE AND AND LIVABLE AT THIS AT THE SAME TIME AND THIS IS SOMETHING THIS GRANT OF REALISTIC APPROACH IS IS IS VERY. THIS SET UP A WHOLE NEW FIFTY DISTRICTS AND YOU KNOW BURKE ON DECADES JUST TO YOU KNOW. TO TO TO FIND THE RIGHT SOLUTIONS DID WHAT'S AT THE CD TOGETHER WITH PABNA SO IT'S UNIVERSITIES COMPANIES IT'S IT'S WHAT. IT IS DOING -- TO TO CHIEF THESE THESE KIND OF CALLS TO MAKE OUR CITIES OUT MORE SUSTAINABLE NOW I CAN'T READ MY OWN HANDWRITING BUT GENERAL CHAT LAST YET FOCUSING ON WASTE IN PARTICULAR SELECT THE RIGHT THE WASTE MANAGEMENT ISSUES AND WELL -- THEWASTE MANAGEMENT IT'S INTERESTING -- AT DAD'S ARM AB AB WASTE TO ENERGY IS IT IS IT IS IT IS IT IS A GREAT ISSUE INDIANA RIGHT SO APPROXIMATELY IN AUSTIN 50%. OFF THE WASTE IS RECYCLED -- ENDS SO THEY HAVE PRACTICALLY NO FEAR THAT LANDFILLS ANYMORE AND OF GOES INTO A GOES INTO -- IT WASTE INCINERATION PLANTS. AT THESE WASTE INCINERATION PLANTS IN THE END THE HOUSE SO CUTTING EDGE THE IDEA OF BASICALLY A VERY EXPENSIVE BUT THE REALLY CUTTING EDGE YOU HAVE NO VIRTUALLY NO POLLUTION SO I WENT TO BUSINESS SCHOOL RIGHT YOU KNOW. ACROSS THE STREET FROM THE WAIST. I INTO AND OF I TRANSFERRED INTO AN ITCHY AND 40% OF ALL HOUSEHOLDS IT MORE THAN 40% OF ALL FALL WAS ALL HOUSEHOLDS IN VIENNA. OUR OF AYE AYE AYE SUPPLIED FROM THESE OF DISTRICT HEATING OF OF OF FROM THESE DISTRICT HEATING SYSTEMS WITHOUT HAWKS WARDA. AND THE AND AND HEATING AND AS WELL AS AIR CONDITIONING SO THIS IS KIND OF A VERY INTERESTING SYSTEM SO -- SO IT'S TEN THROUGH -- IS THERE A GRANT CAPTURE. RIGHT YEAH. OKAY AND AND AND AND I AND I JESTERS I MEAN IS IT THE THIRD OF ORGANIC MATERIAL THAT YOU'RE. TURNING INTO LSG. WELL IT'S IT'S IT'S A VERY SOPHISTICATED SYSTEM BECAUSE THAT'S WHY I DIDN'T WANT TO FOCUS AND I'M NOT AN EXPERT ON THAT BUT ONLY FOCUS ON ON ON ON ON THE ON THE ON THE ON THE WASTE MANAGEMENT RIGHT BECAUSE IT'S A VERY HOLISTIC SYSTEM. LIKE WHERE OF FOR INSTANCE THE IN THE IN THE SUBWAY SYSTEM THE ENERGY PRODUCED IN THE BREAKING PROCESS. OFF THE OFF THE OFF THE YEAH IS FED INTO THE ENERGY SYSTEM AGAIN AND THEY KIND OF USED TO ELECTRICITY. TO TO OPERATE THE ESCALATE THIS ALLEYWAY THIS ELECTRICITY AND SO ON SO IT IS KIND OF BY THE ADAM THAT'S WHAT I MEANT IT'S IT'S IT'S BASICALLY A SYSTEM. WHICH I WHICH WHICH IS A COMPREHENSIVE RIGHT AND WHICH IS NOT ONLY LIMITED TO A TWO TO ONE ASPECT WHICH IS IMPORTANT OF COURSE TWO WAY STREET. CRAFT ALL RIGHT. COULD NOT VERY I MEAN I KNOW YOU'VE TAKEN A COUPLE TRIPS TO EUROPE ON ON THESE ON THIS KIND OF THIS WASTE MANAGEMENT ISSUE RIGHT AND IS THERE THERE'S WHAT. DO YOU WANNA CAN GIVE US A QUICK EXAMINATION I I PRESUME THAT VNS USING THAT WE HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY. TO TO DO THE CARBON CAPTURE IN THAT THE THE RAP AGAINST INCINERATORS IS THAT AT LEAST IN THE UNITED STATES WE JUST BURN THE TRASH AND ALL THE POLITICAL UP INTO THE AIR RIGHT SO. IT'S IN MY GENERATION WAS THE CATTLE ACT AND IT BECAME THE LEXUS I GUESS IS THE TESLA VERSION OF INCINERATION AND IF PRISCILLA PRESLEY WERE HERE HE'D SAY IT'S NOT YOUR FATHER'S INCINERATOR RIGHT. TO YOU OKAY THESE ARE THE THESE VIENNESE INCINERATORS PROVIDE NECESSARY ELECTRICITY AND HEATING FOR THE CITY BUT THEY HAVE -- ZERO CARBON EMISSIONS A RIGHT NEAR. ZERO ZERO NOW THEY'RE EXPENSIVE VERY EXPENSIVE THERE IS RIGHT RIGHT -- BUT IT'S DOES IT BECAUSE IT'S AT THE AT THE CITY SANTA YOU KNOW THEY EVEN INCINERATION PLANTS. BATES THOSE TO THE CITY CENTER BUT IT'S IT'S NO -- DEAD AND COMING FROM. A DELEGATIONS FROM HONG KONG AND AYE AYES TALKS IN HONG KONG A COUPLE OF YEARS BACK AND IS IT HOW DID YOU DO THAT YOU KNOW BECAUSE WE CABS. HOW HOW CAN YOU IN ALL? KIND OF OPERATE THEM YEAH IN THE SITUATION PLANTED THE CITY OF AT THE AT THE BE THE MIDDLE OF THE CITY AND AND SO. THAT IS IT RIGHT SO -- YOU HAVE TO HUGE BEST A VAGUE SPANS OF TECHNOLOGY BUT IT PAYS OFF RIGHT IN THE METRICS THAT WE DO A POOR JOB OF CALCULATING THE EMISSIONS FROM LANDFILLS HERE WE JUST SERVICE IT'S A BIG CALIFORNIA SECRET WE THINGS THAT END UP IN A LANDFILL WE KNOW THAT THEY ROCK AND THEY GO THROUGH. THERE'S THERE'S NOTHING THAT IS HE MADE A WE'RE TRYING TO CAPTURE THAT BUT WE DON'T REALLY SPEND TIME TALKING ABOUT WHAT THAT. THAT THAT EFFECT ON GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS IS YOU. I GUESS THE QUESTION IS IS THAT. OVERALL OUTSIDE OF VIENNA IN AUSTRIA IS YES VIRTUALLY I MEAN THE F. F. BEING FUNDAMENTAL REDUCED YOU KNOW OF IN IN THE LAST DECADE SO. IT'S IT'S IT'S MOSTLY IT'S IT'S ALSO SO AND RECYCLING OF WASTE AND YOU KNOW IT IT'S IT'S A LOT WITH BECAUSE IT'S A REYES COMPREHENSIVES SUBJECT RIGHT. SO IT'S UP TO AVOID WASTE THIS IS OF COURSE THE FIRST STEP IN THIS IS ALSO BE MENTIONED ALSO BE MENTIONED IN YOUR DISCUSSION. OF A SO TO TO AVOID ONE TIME USE ITS ADDRESS SO IT'S IT'S ALL OF THIS PUBLIC POLICY TO ADVOCATES RIGHT INTO A TO A TOOL. TO TO PASS LEGISLATION THAT AVOIDS -- OF OF ONE TIME AND ONE TIME USE IT SHOULD SET TO A RIGHT AND THEN OF COURSE IT'S IT'S IT'S WITH CYCLING WHICH IS REALLY BIG IN AUSTRIA. AND TELLS A LOT OF FAR OFF TECH COMPANIES A GOOD FOCUS ON ON ON ON THESE AREAS. AND THEN OF COURSE THERE'S THE INCINERATION SO IT'S IT'S I BAY COMPLEX PROCESS RIGHT CAN YOU GIVE US A FLAVOR OF THE TYPE OF RECYCLING -- THAT'S HAPPENING AT LEAST AND PLASTICS BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE HAVE PLASTIC BOTTLES WHICH ARE RELATIVELY EASY TO RECYCLE ALTHOUGH WE DO A LOUSY JOB HERE IN CALIFORNIA AS FAR AS WE GOT A NUMBER THEN THERE'S THESE OTHER CONTAINERS I'LL PUT THEM IN. DIRTY PLASTIC THERE'S YOGURT AND MAYONNAISE AND THEY THESE TYPE OF THING SO RIGHT THAT COME IN THESE CONTAINERS -- AND RAPPERS -- HOW DO YOU HOW TO DOING ON THESE SEGREGATING THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF PLASTIC THE FIRST QUESTION THE SECOND IS IS -- LIMITING THE THE CONTAINERS THAT THE FREE MARKET IS USING IN THE IN THE CITY I KNOW THAT THE U. E. U. HAS. A DIRECT THEM THAT THE YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO BUT JUST HISTORICALLY WHAT IS AUSTRIA DEAD WEIGHT WELL -- FIRST OF ALL -- YOU KNOW AB AS YOU KNOW IS IN MANY EAST. EUROPEAN COUNTRIES HAVE A SOPHISTICATED WASTE SEPARATION SYSTEM RIGHT YOU DON'T HAVE ONLY THESE TWO BOXES OLD PAPER ANNA. BUT YOU HAVE ONE FOR PLASTIC AND AND ONE FOR PAPER AND ONE FOR GLASS FOR GREEN THEIR SOCIAL FOR FOR FOR KILEY. GREEN GLASS FOR WHITE GLASS IT'S ADDRESS THEN YOU HAVE KIND OF EXACTLY RIGHT SO HERE FOR A FULL. STEPPED UP OF THESE CONTAINERS AT A AND AND USUALLY IT'S IT MUST ALSO BE THERE'S ALSO IT MUST BE INDICATED ON THE PACKAGE. OFF THE OF THE MATERIAL IF IT'S RECYCLE ALL NOT. RIGHT AND AND AND YOU'RE COMPLETELY RIGHT DID SOME IN ALL OF IT TAKES ALSO SOME EFFORTS TO AVOID THAT PEOPLE COLLECT TO MATCH RIGHT BECAUSE THE DAY OF BUT THEY PUT A LOT OF THINGS INTO THE CONTAINER WHICH SHOULDN'T BE DEBT OR I AM. OR IN OUR CASE WE'RE PUTTING A LOT OF THINGS IN THE CONTAINERS THAT. WERE TELLING PEOPLE TO PUT THE CONTAINERS YET RIGHT AND OF GETTING RECYCLE RIGHT IT'S COMPLICATED FOR MATTER CONVENIENCE TO SINGLE STREAM MOST OF THE RESIDENTIAL RECYCLING SYSTEM IN RIGHT -- THERE'S BEEN SOME SERIOUS DOWNSIDE SAID THERE'S SOME OUTSIDE THERE'S SOME SERIOUS DOWNSIZE BECAUSE SO. IT IS DISTRESSING HOW LITTLE THAT THAT WHICH GETS DURING THESE BEEN SENSE OF ACTUALLY GETTING RECYCLED IN THE END OF THE DAY. SO WE APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR TESTIMONY MISTER CONSUL GENERAL THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR PARTICIPATION I I KNOW I THINK THIS IS CERTAINLY GOING TO BRING UP SOME MORE QUESTIONS FOR THINGS WE WANT TO LEARN FROM THE U. ON I MEAN IT YEAH THIS INCINERATION ISSUES CONTROVERSIAL. BUT BUT YOU KNOW IT'S LIKE AS AS GERM. WHAT CASKEY SAID YOU KNOW THE -- NOT YOUR GRANDMOTHER'S INCINERATION AND AND MAYBE THEIR WAYS OF DOING IT AT THE ENGAGING IN THAT KIND OF ACTIVITY AND MUCH MORE ENVIRONMENTALLY SUSTAINABLE WAY THEY COULD ACTUALLY PRODUCE ENERGY AS WE LIVE. IS WRITTEN AS WE MOVE ALONG SO THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE THANK YOU FOR PARTICIPATION AND AND FOR YOUR INSIGHTS. SO THAT WILL OPEN UP THE THE THE THE AND ON THESE ISSUES AND I WILL GO BACK INTO ARE YOU Q. HEARING. MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE POLITIQUE MAN. OKAY -- I HAVE THE HONOR OF REPRESENTING THE SIX LARGEST PROCESSOR RECYCLER RE KLEBER'S SO I HAVE THE GUYS WHO MAKE BOTTLES AND BOTTLES. AND WORK LAST YEAR WITH SENATOR WHITE HOUSE SKI AND SOME OF THE ON THESE ISSUES I HAVE A COUPLE OF POINTS TO MAKE IT WAS A FASCINATING HEARING I'VE GOT TO GO TO A DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENT SO I CAN'T STAY BUT A COUPLE OF THINGS. ONE WHEN YOU CONSIDER WHAT IS RECYCLABLE ISN'T BESIDES THE FACT IT ALL GOES INTO ONE FAN. THE THE DIAGRAM THE RECYCLING DIAGRAM NUMBERS AREN'T CORRECT. I MEAN THEY OFTEN HAVE ONES ON THEM AND THEY AREN'T ONES SO LOOKING AT THAT IS REALLY KEY. ARE CLOSE LOOP WAS WHAT WE TRY TO DO WHICH IS YOU TAKE A BOTTLE OF PLASTIC ITS USE IT GOES BACK TO OUR PEOPLE THEY MAKE IT INTO A NEW PRODUCT IN THAT IT BECOMES A NEW PIECE OF RECYCLED PLASTIC OUR P. ET -- AND PART OF OUR PROBLEM IS THE CAN LOT OF CRAPPY GOING INTO THE SAME BàN AND THEN WE HAVE TO SORT IT AND OBVIOUSLY FIVE TWO SEVENS GO TO THE TOP BECAUSE THERE'S NO OTHER USE -- FOR THAT I KNOW OF RIGHT NOW ALTHOUGH I KNOW YOU HAVE SOME IDEAS -- AND THEN THE FACT OF JUST CONTINUING LEADING VIRGIN PLASTIC COMMENDED STATE IN CONTAINERS IF IT DOESN'T RECYCLED IT'S JUST A PROBLEM. IT ISN'T YOU KNOW MAYBE IT'S CHEAPER BUT IT'S JUST PROBLEMS SO I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU AND THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING US HERE. HI THERE -- THANK YOU FOR HAVING THIS HEARING THIS IS GREAT THANK YOU FOR TAKING PUBLIC COMMENTS. I'M CHRISTY GAMER AND THE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY COUNCIL ON OCEAN AFFAIRS SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY COAST. I KNOW SOME OF YOU KNOW WHO WE ARE FOR THOSE OF YOU DON'T KNOW WHO YOU ARE WHO WE ARE WORKING TO CHANGE THAT -- APPRECIATED DOCTOR GORDON'S COMMENTS ON SO WHAT SOME UNIVERSITIES ARE DOING AND I WANTED TO POINT OUT THAT EARLIER THIS YEAR THE CSU. ADOPTED A SINGLE USE PLASTICS POLICY WHICH WILL PHASE OUT THE USE OF ALL SINGLE USE STRAWS. TAKE OUT BAGS AND THE SALE AND DISTRIBUTION OF PLASTIC WATER BOTTLES BY. TWENTY TWENTY THREE NOW I PERSONALLY AS AN INDIVIDUAL WISH IT WAS ALL FASTER I'M SURE WE ALL DAY -- BUT I DO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT THE CSU IS THE LARGEST PUBLIC UNIVERSITY SYSTEM IN THE COUNTRY FOR FOUR YEAR DEGREES AND I HOPE THAT THAT SERVES AS A MODEL FOR OTHER UNIVERSITIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY AS WELL. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I DID WANT TO SAY WITH REGARD TO SINGLE USE PLASTICS IS THAT I SEE WHEN I GO TO THE GROCERY STORE THAT THERE ARE STILL PLASTIC BAGS. THAT I THINK ARE NOT TECHNICALLY SINGLE USE BECAUSE THE PLASTIC IS ACTUALLY THICKER. SO THEY'RE HIGHLY DISPOSABLE. SO I CAN ENVISION THAT HAPPENING WITH PLASTIC WATER BOTTLES WHICH IS ONE OF COAST BIG ISSUES -- WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT IF WE PHASE OUT AND BANNED SINGLE USE WATER BOTTLES THAT THE LANGUAGE IS APPROPRIATE. SO THAT WE DON'T JUST END UP WITH PLASTIC WATER BOTTLES THAT SOMEHOW ARE NOT TECHNICALLY SINGLE USE. THE OTHER THING I THINK WE NEED TO CONSIDER AS WE GO FORWARD AS THE ECONOMY AND THE ECONOMIC IMPACT THIS ECONOMY I THINK THRIVES TO A LARGE EXTENT ON SINGLE USE PLASTICS AND A DISPOSABLE ECONOMY. I'M IN FAVOR OF THE OBVIOUSLY CHANGING THE WAY THAT IN ORDER TO BE SUCCESSFUL WE NEED TO INCORPORATE THAT ASPECT OF IT AS WELL SO WE CAN ENSURE. PEOPLE'S LIVELIHOODS AND AND SUSTAINABLE INDUSTRY THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING SIR ALAN AND THAT YOU'RE STERN COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS ASHLEY LAKE -- DRINKER AND I'M THE PACIFIC POLICY AND COMMUNICATIONS MANAGER WITH -- SHE AND I JUST WANTED TO SAY I THINK. A QUICK THANK YOU -- TO BOTH COMMITTEES FOR JOINTLY COMING TOGETHER TO HAVE THIS INFORMATIONAL HEARING. ON I THINK IT'S VERY CLEAR FROM THE COMMENTS THAT YOU WITH A LEGISLATIVE MEMBERS HAVE MADE THIS MORNING THAT THE GLOBAL PLASTICS CRISIS AND THE IMPLICATIONS IN CALIFORNIA IS AN ISSUE THAT ALL OF YOU ARE VERY. WELL VERSED ON AND VERY PASSIONATE ABOUT SO WE JUST WANT -- TO AS SHE AND I THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP AND WE RECOGNIZE THAT THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF PIECES OF LEGISLATION OVER SEVERAL YEARS THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS TO ADDRESS -- SOME PRIORITY PRODUCTS WHICH IS VERY IMPORTANT -- BUT AS I FIVE COMMENTS SOME OF YOU HAVE MADE AND AND SOME OF THE ON EXPERT TESTIMONY JUST WANTED TO ECHO SOME OF THE COMMENTS THAT. WHAT WE REALLY NEED GOING FORWARD IS MORE A MORE COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTION TO ADDRESSING THE SINGLE USE PLASTICS CRISIS AND WE BELIEVE THAT RECYCLING IS IMPORTANT AND SHOULD BE PROMOTED -- BUT RECYCLING ALONE ISN'T THE ANSWER WHAT WE REALLY NEED IS -- SOURCE REDUCTION AND OBVIOUSLY THEIR EFFORTS -- THEY IS -- SENATOR ALLEN HIM BEING ONE OF THE MAIN AUTHORS TO REALLY -- TACKLE THIS AND OTHERS. THE TACKLE THE PROBLEM COMPREHENSIVELY AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO THE CONTINUING CONVERSATIONS THIS YEAR SO THANK YOU AGAIN FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP. GOOD MORNING -- MY NAME IS STEVE WILSON AND THE CAMPAIGN'S DIRECTOR AT THE STORY OF STUFF PROJECT. ONE OF THANK YOU ALL -- FOR HOLDING THIS HEARING AND TAKES VERY LEADERSHIP -- CHAIRMAN ALAN. I HAVE OVER THE PAST YEAR HAVE BEEN FILMING OF A MOVIE CALLED THE STORY OF PLASTIC AND WE'RE LOOKING AT PLASTIC POLLUTION FROM EXTRACTION ALL THE WAY TO DISPOSAL ALL THE WAY TO THE OCEAN. WE FILMED ON THREE CONTINENTS. AND SOME OF THE MOST STARTLING THINGS I'VE SEEN -- OUR IN OUR OWN COUNTRY THERE IS A QUESTION BY SENATOR EARLIER ABOUT WHAT IS THE UNITED STATES CONTRIBUTION TO PLASTIC POLLUTION. AND I CAN SAY UNEQUIVOCALLY IT'S NUMBER. ONE AND WHY I SAY THAT IS BECAUSE COLLECTIVELY THE PETROCHEMICAL INDUSTRY HAS INVESTED TWO HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS. INTO ADDITIONAL REFINING CAPACITY FOR PLASTIC FEEDSTOCKS. THEIR PROPOSES THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE AS SAYING CRACKERS AND WE ARE EXPORTING THIS TO CHINA AND WE ARE EXPORTING THIS TO EUROPE. SO PLASTIC POLLUTION THAT ORIGINATESFROM A RIVER IN THE PHILIPPINES. ULTIMATELY ORIGINATED FROM A THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY OR IN APPALACHIA OR IN NORTH DAKOTA. WE ARE HE LARGEST EXPORTER OF OIL AND GAS AT THIS POINT. THE GOAL OF THE PETROCHEMICAL INDUSTRY IS TO PUT 40% MORE PLASTIC INTO COMMERCE BY. TWENTY TWENTY FIVE SO IF WE THINK ABOUT THAT THAT MEANS EVERY GARBAGE CAN AND OUR ENTIRE COUNTRY NEEDS TO BE 40% BIGGER. AND I'VE ALSO SEEN WHERE THIS STUFF GOES AND WE TALK ABOUT RECYCLING. AND I WAS INSERTED BY INDONESIA. AND I WAS IN A FIELD WHERE YOU CANNOT SEE THE GROUND ALL YOU CAN SEE IS TREES AND SHRUBS STICKING OUT. AND YOU GO THROUGH THIS WASTE. AND YOU ARE PICKING OUT TRADER JOE'S YOU'RE PICKING OUT STARBUCKS YOU'RE PICKING OUT A A RP CARDS SO IT'S OBVIOUS WHERE IT'S COMING FROM. THERE IS NO WHERE FOR THIS STUFF TO GO IT'S WHY CHINA CLOSED ITS DOORS VIETNAM HAS JUST DONE IT INDIA'S DONE IT MALAYSIA'S PARTIALLY DOING IT -- AND SO ON AND SO FORTH THERE IS NO AWAY AND THERE IS A MASS OF GLUT OF PLASTIC COMING. AND UNTIL WE FIX THE SYSTEM. WE ARE NOT GOING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM WE NEED TO REDUCE BY SOURCE. WE NEED TO INCENTIVIZE AND FIX THE RECYCLING ECONOMICS HERE IN CALIFORNIA. IT IS AN ETHICAL TO EXPORT WAY AND I SEE WHAT HAPPENS TO IT IS OPENLY BURNED IT IS USED AS FUEL AND TOFU FACTORIES. AND PLACES WITH NO ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROLS SO. THE IMPORTANCE OF US TAKING A SYSTEMIC APPROACH AND A COMPREHENSIVE BILL IN CALIFORNIA. WILL SET PRECEDENT. FOR THE ENTIRE COUNTRY AND IT'S OUR GOAL AND OUR ORGANIZATIONAL SCHOOL TO USE THIS MODEL ON A MULTI STATE STRATEGY SIMILAR TO WHAT WE DID ON MICHAEL B.. CALIFORNIA WAS THE FIRST TO ACTON MICROBEADS THEY ARE NOW LARGELY ELIMINATED IN THE OCCIDENTAL WORLD AND THEY ARE CURRENTLY BEING -- THEIR PROPOSALS AS WELL IN TAIWAN. AND IN CHINA. SO WHAT WE DO HERE MAKES A DIFFERENCE I NEGOTIATED FEDERAL LEGISLATION ON MICROBEADS. AND I WAS ABLE TO TALK TO LEGISLATORS IN DC AND SAY. I DON'T CARE IF YOU PASS A POLICY. BECAUSE CALIFORNIA DID IT AND THAT MEANS THAT ALL THESE COMPANIES ARE GOING TO HAVE TO REDESIGN. TO WHAT CALIFORNIA DID% SO AND LESS YOU GIVE US OUR ENVIRONMENT TO LINK WHICH I DON'T CARE IF IT PASSES THAT'S HOW IMPORTANT ARE STATES WORK IS IN THIS STUFF. SO I RECOGNIZE AND TAKING A LOT OF TIME AND SPACE BUT I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR EFFORTS HERE. AND I'M WITH YOU TO HELP IN ANY WAY POSSIBLE AND I WILL WORK TO GET OUR MOVIE TO THE CAPITAL THIS SUMMER -- AND THE THINGS YOU WILL SEE IN IT WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS -- TEN JUST LIKE WITH THE AMERICAN CHEMISTRY COUNCIL I WILL SAY. WITHOUT QUESTION -- MY ORGANIZATION. MEMBER COMPANIES MEMBER MEMBER MANY CUSTOMER GROUPS RECOGNIZE THAT WE ARE IN A CRITICAL STAGE IN TERMS NOT ONLY OF OCEAN PLASTICS BUT ISSUES AROUND RECYCLING AND FINDING DOMESTIC MARKETS FOR THIS MATERIAL. NO QUESTION THAT WE NEED TO TAKE ACTION IN AND BE INVOLVED IN THAT. I WILL LET YOU ALL KNOW THAT WE'RE VERY COMMITTED TO ACHIEVING THAT OBJECTIVE YESTERDAY I DISTRIBUTE YOUR OFFICES A A PACKET OF INFORMATION THAT OUTLINES. A NUMBER OF THE INITIATIVES THAT WE'RE UNDERTAKING ARE ONLY VOLUNTEER INITIATIVES GLOBAL INITIATIVES OVER ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENTS ON INNING PLASTICS -- IN THE OCEAN A NEW RECYCLING INITIATIVES LEGISLATIVE INITIATIVES THAT WE'VE SUPPORT IN THE PAST WE WERE WITH YOU CENTER ALLEN ON A BILL LAST SESSION ONE WORK WITH YOU ON THIS -- ON SB FIFTY FOUR THEY WERE GONNA HERE IN A LITTLE BIT LATER SO I I I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO TAKE A LOOK AT THOSE MATERIALS -- IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT THEM -- WE ARE CERTAINLY AVAILABLE TO TALK ABOUT NOT ONLY OUR INITIATIVES BUT NEW TECHNOLOGIES YOU HEARD A LITTLE BIT ABOUT -- INCINERATION IN IN THE EUROPEAN -- SETTING -- MANY OF OUR COMPANIES ARE ON THE INNOVATIVE -- FOR FRONT OF TAKING SOME OF MOLECULAR STATE IN IN NEW TECHNOLOGIES ARE AS HE'S ME NEW PRODUCTS SO THERE'S A WHOLE A WHOLE HOST OF THINGS GOING ON WE WERE WE WERE COMMITTED TO BEING A PART OF IT WANT TO WORK WITH THE ANATOMY APPRECIATE JUST THE OPTION TO MAKE. THIS COMMENT DISTRIBUTE THAT INFORMATION YESTERDAY -- AND AGAIN COULD YOU TAKE A LOOK AT IT AND HAVE A CHAT FURTHER ABOUT IT THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU. HELLO CHRISTOPHER CHEN WITH THE CENTER FOR OCEANIC AWARENESS RESEARCH AND EDUCATION. AND I JUST SPENT THE LAST TWO WEEKS IN NAIROBI AT THE U. N. ENVIRONMENT ASSEMBLY WHERE I WAS HELPING NEGOTIATE SOME OF THE RESOLUTIONS ON PLASTICS. FOR THE WORLD'S HIGHEST LEVEL DECISION MAKING BODY ON THE ENVIRONMENT. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT CAME FROM THIS WAS A JOINT DECLARATION MINISTERIAL DECLARATION BY THE MINISTERS AND HEADS OF STATE OF ALMOST TWO HUNDRED COUNTRIES. RECOGNIZING AND DECLARING THAT WE NEED TO SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE OUR DEPENDENCE ON SINGLE USE PLASTICS. WITH [inaudible] THE PROPOSE PRODUCTION INCREASE OF PLASTICS TO TO INCREASE BY OF A IN THE NEXT FIVE TO TEN YEARS WE SIMPLY CANNOT DO THIS BY A RECYCLING AND INCINERATION ALONE AND IN FACT INCINERATION. IS SEEN BY MOST AS A VERY TOXIC WAY TO GO BECAUSE OF THE THE ADDITIVES AND AND ALL OF THE BY PRODUCTS. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE SIMPLY CANNOT RECYCLE OUR WAY OUT OF WEEKS WE CANNOT INCINERATE OUR WAY OUT OF THIS PROBLEM WE NEED TO REDUCE. THE PRODUCTION OF PLASTIC IT IS THE ONLY WAY THAT WE CAN AS STEVE SAID NOT HAVE TO INCREASE THE SIZE OF OUR GARBAGE CANS NOT HAVE TO CONTINUE TO EXPLORE OUR WASTE. I'M VERY EXCITED THAT CALIFORNIA HAS A BILL THAT WILL BE HEARING LATER TODAY THAT CAN HELP. PROVIDE THE FRAMEWORK FOR THIS MUCH NEEDED CHANGE. I'M HAPPY TO BE BACK HERE AND I'M HERE TO BE A RESOURCE FOR YOU I THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU [inaudible] MR. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS KELLY ASTOR -- I REPRESENT A VARIETY OF WASTE RECYCLING TRADE GROUPS -- CHIEF AMONG THEM THE CALIFORNIA REFUSE RECYCLING COUNCIL I DEVOTED MUCH OF MY LIFE LAST YEAR TO TRY TO GET THE WORD OUT ON CHINA'S NATIONAL SORT OF WAS TO IMPORT POLICY ON THE EFFECT IT WAS HAVING ON THE INDUSTRY HERE. I'M DELIGHTED FOR THE HEARING THAT YOU HAD TODAY AND THANK BOTH CO CHAIRS OF FOR THAT I THOUGHT A LOT OF VALUABLE INFORMATION. WAS DISTRIBUTED AND CONVERSATION OCCURRED. BOB I DON'T KNOW WHETHER TIME ALLOW ME TO BE ATTENDING ALL THE HEARING THIS AFTERNOON BUT I ALSO WANT TO COMMUNICATE TO YOU ARE. ARE -- PLEASURE IN OFFERING SUPPORT FOR YOUR SB. FIFTY FOUR ONE MIGHT ORDINARILY THINK DID INDUSTRY WOULD HAVE CONCERNS IN THAT IN OUR FACILITIES ARE BUILT TO OPERATE EFFICIENTLY WE ONE LOT OF THROUGHPUT COMING THROUGH THEM. THE LESSON OF THE NATIONAL SORT HAS BEEN FOR US THAT WE REALLY -- NEED HELP IN TERMS OF MARKET DEVELOPMENT AND TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU'RE LEGISLATION STEERS THE ECONOMY AWAY FROM MATERIALS THAT WE CANNOT WE CAN PROCESS THAT WE CAN COLLECT THEM. IF THEY HAVE NO HOME WERE SITTING ON THEM THE IDEA THAT OUR CONSUMERS OUR CUSTOMERS ARE ARE MADE TO UNDERSTAND THAT THEY'RE GONNA END UP. LAND FILLING MATERIAL THAT THEY THOUGHT WAS DESTINED FOR RECYCLING IS A REAL PROBLEM FOR US ALSO WE WE APPLAUD YOU ON THAT AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY. AND FOR YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS ISSUE THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS COREY CHAU LIBERAL AND I AM THE CO FOUNDER OF REPURPOSE WE ARE THE LEADING BRAND OF COMPOSTABLE TABLEWARE IN THE RETAIL MARKET -- WE BRING PRODUCTS A COMMERCIAL PRODUCTS LIKE WE DISCUSSED TODAY TO CONSUMERS AT SHELF LEVEL WE CREATED THE INDUSTRY AT PLACES LIKE SAFEWAY ALBERTSONS -- AT WALMART AND ARE RAISING AWARENESS AROUND ISSUES OF SINGLE USE PLASTICS AND BRING PEOPLE ALTERNATIVES IN THE GROCERY AISLE THERE WAS NO ALTERNATIVE THERE ARE ORGANIC EGGS WHICH ARE GOING TO CATCH UP BUT THERE WAS JUST THE THREE CHINA DIXIE SOLO -- PLASTIC BRANDS OUT THERE WE CREATED THAT MARKET AND WE ARE NOW NOT NATIONWIDE LEADING COMPANY WE ARE ALSO A CALIFORNIA BASED COMPANY WE ARE IN LOS ANGELES SIMPLY FIFTEEN PEOPLE. WERE VERY MUCH SUPPORT THIS BILL OBVIOUSLY WE FEEL THAT -- ARMADOS REVIEWS FIRST REPURPOSE SECOND WITH THE CONCEPT THAT WE SHOULD BE ELIMINATING SING THESE PLASTICS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE BUT I THINK THE COMMITTEE. HAS RIGHTFULLY RECOGNIZE THAT THERE IS A NEED FOR SOME SINGLE USE DISPOSABLES AND IF THEY COULD BE MADE FROM GREENER SOURCES AND DISPOSED OF AND GREENER WAY SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR LETTING SPEAK AND WE LOOK FOR DURING THE BILL THANK YOU. AND JUSTICE FOR FOLKS THE FOLKS ARE HERE TO COMMENT ON THE BILL SB. FIFTY FOUR PLEASE WAIT UNTIL THAT TIME COMES IT WILL JUST TAKE COMMENT ON THE HEARING THAT WE JUST FOUND. ON PLASTIC SO. GOOD MORNING I THINK IT'S STILL. IN TIME. GOOD AFTERNOON -- THANK YOU CHAIRMAN ALAN INSURANCE STERN FOR THE HEARING THIS MORNING AND OTHERS WHO PARTICIPATED I THINK IT WAS VERY INFORMATIVE -- THOSE OF US WHO HAVE BEEN WORKING ON PLASTIC ISSUES FOR MANY MANY YEARS NOW MYSELF SINCE NINETEEN NINETY TWO ACTUALLY -- WENOW ARE ARE CAN OF SHOCKED AND AMAZED THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T ALREADY KNOW SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WERE SHOWN HERE THIS MORNING SO I THANK YOU. FOR BRINGING THAT TO LIGHT -- IN ALSO FOR THEM I'M NOT GONNA COMMENT OR A I AM I SAID I SUPPORT YOUR BILL BUT I WON'T COMMENT ON THAT AT THIS POINT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I WANTED TO MENTION HERE TODAY -- IT WAS A LITTLE BIT CONCERNED ABOUT THE CALLING FROM VIENNA WHO SPOKE SO. WONDERFULLY ABOUT THEIR INCINERATION SYSTEM AND WHERE IT MAY BE STATE OF THE ART AND IT MAY NOT BE PUTTING OUT A LOT OF POLLUTION IT'S NOT AN ANSWER IF YOU'RE GONNA GO TO THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY. AND I ANYTIME YOU INCINERATED TAKE THOSE MOLECULES OUT OF PLAY IT FORCES ADDITIONAL VIRGIN PRODUCTION IF WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO BE PRODUCING SINGLE USE ITEM SO SOURCE REDUCTION. FOLLOWED BY THAT RECYCLING AS MUCH AS IS POSSIBLE IN COMPOSTING ARE THE ONLY WAYS TO GO AND SO I WOULD STRONGLY URGE YOU NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES TO INCLUDE INCINERATION. IN ANY KIND OF BILL THAT WOULD COME OUT THAT HAS A GO. OR A CIRCULAR ECONOMY SYSTEM THANK YOU THANK YOU. LAWYER MARIN ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA GROSSES ATION -- GREAT HEARING -- PARTICULAR WANT TO TALK ABOUT -- THERE IS SOME A SECTION OF THE TEST MY THEY HAD TO DO WITH FOOD -- AND SINGLE USE -- REDUCTION JUST WANT TO MAKE THE VERY IMPORTANT DISTINCTION -- AS YOU CRAP POLICIES MOVING FORWARD REGARDING TO SINGLE USE PLASTIC IS IS JUST THE DIFFERENCE THAT EXIST BETWEEN. GROCERY PACKAGING VERSES MORE RESTAURANT ORIENTED PACKAGING AND YOU KNOW THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND WE WOULD LIKE TO TELL PEOPLE THAT YOU KNOW VERY OFTEN. A RESTAURANT TYPE PACKAGING LIVES FOR AN HOUR AT THE MOST YOU PICK UP THE FOOD YOU EAT YOU THREE STUFF AWAY YOU'RE A% GROCERY STORE. YOU'RE BUYING US UP IN THE THE DELI BAKERY -- MEAT COUNTER YOU KNOW THAT THAT PACKAGE AND IT'S EXPECTED TO KEEP FOOD SAFE AND AND EDIBLE FOR LONGER PERIODS OF TIME BECAUSE PEOPLE YOU KNOW JUST DON'T. GO TO THE STORE AND EAT YOUR SIX MUFFINS GENERALLY THE BEAR ABOUT HOW BAD YOUR DAY'S WELL YEAH EXACTLY EXACTLY SO -- JUST WOULD ASK THAT YOU KEEP THAT -- THOUGHT IN MIND MOVING FORWARD -- AND JUST TO KNOW THAT YOU KNOW WE'RE HERE AS GROCERS -- WE'VE DONE AT SEVERAL COMPANIES WITH BOTH SUPPLIER AND RETAILER TAKEN STEPS TO REDUCE -- THE TIED THE NUMBER OF WASTE OF THE AMOUNT OF WASTE ISSUES BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY AS WAS POINTED OUT EARLIER EIGHT HELPS OUR BOTTOM LINE. BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE ALWAYS HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND THAT THAT SAFETY -- AND FOOD LONGEVITY IS OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE OUR FOLKS AND JUST ASK YOU KEEP THAT IN MIND A WITHIN LEGISLATION FORTUNE THANKS SO MUCH THANK YOU. OKAY LAST BUT NOT LEAST IN THE MORNING GOING TO THE BILLS THANK. CHAIRMAN I'M HI SAM BURNHAM WITH THE NATIONAL STORAGE OF ACTION COUNCIL OR A SPIN OFF OF THE CALIFORNIA PRODUCTS OR TO COUNSEL. AND WE ADVOCATE FOR CIRCULAR ECONOMY. I WANTED TO REITERATE WHAT -- MISS GORDON SAID ABOUT SOURCE REDUCTION IS SO IMPORTANT HAVE IT FIRST -- MATERIAL LIMITATION IS GOING TO BE IMPORTANT WE HAVE A LOT OF PLASTICS THAT WERE COMING IN AS WE CAN DO NOTHING WITH. AND HAVING THEM IN THE SYSTEM IS IS VERY DEBT TO POSSIBILITY POSSIBLY FOR WHAT'S THAT LEFT IN THE PACKAGING AND I DID WANNA A BUILD UP WHICH THE WOMAN JUST SAID ABOUT THE INCINERATION. I WAS IN BELGIUM AND SPOKE AT THE EPR INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE FOR PACKAGING IN. TWENTY TEN AT THAT POINT THEY HAD ALREADY BEEN IN PLACE FOR TWENTY YEARS WITH ANY PAIR SYSTEM FOR PACKAGING. AND THEY HAD TO COUPLE GENERATION FROM THE ECONOMIC GROWTH -- AND THEY'D REDUCED INCINERATION COMMITTEE TO GET THE IMPRESSION THAT JUST BECAUSE WE MIGHT GO WITH AN EXTENDED PRETTIES RESPONSIBILITY MODEL THAT DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN INCREASES FEDERATION FACT IT SHOULD AND IMPLIED DECREASING INCINERATION -- AND I'D ALSO LIKE TO INVITE YOU ALL TO THE GRAND OPENING OF THE AQUA FILL PLANT WHICH IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE FIRST NEW INFRASTRUCTURE PLANTS AND THE STATE RECENTLY -- IT'S GOING TO BE IN WOODLAND AND AND A COUPLE OF MONTHS IT'LL BE OPEN AND IT'S A DIRECT RESULT OF YOUR VOTE ON THE CARPET BILL AB ELEVEN FIFTY EIGHT A TWO YEARS AGO. TO IMPROVE THAT IF YOUR SYSTEM SO. THE JOBS THE INFRASTRUCTURE CAN CALM WHEN WE ACTUALLY PASSED THE RIGHT LEGISLATION THAT'S FAIR ACROSS THE BOARD AND IS CIRCULAR THAT PER PLANT IS A COMPLETELY CIRCULAR ECONOMY APPROACH WHERE IT'S GOING TO PRODUCE FLUFF. ACTUALLY GONNA GO TO SOLVE ANY EVENTUALLY THEY'LL BUILD THE PLANT I IN GEORGIA THAT WILL THEN MAKE IT INTO A PURE PELLETS A GOING TO KELLY SLATER SURFWEAR AND IT'S A CELL MCCARTY HANDBAGS I CAN GO OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND THAT'S WHAT WHERE WE NEED TO STRIVE. FOR SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU ON THIS AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE HEARING THANK YOU THANK YOU I MEAN THERE'S NO THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT -- AND THAT YOU KNOW NO MATTER HOW STATE OF THE ART THERE INCINERATION TECHNIQUES MAYBE IT'S AN ABSOLUTE SUB PAR WAY OF HANDLING THIS PROBLEM -- THE SAD THING IS THAT A LOT OF THAT STUFF THAT FOLKS THINK. IS BEING RECYCLED WHEN THEY THROW IN THEIR BINS HERE IN THE UNITED STATES AND THAT ACTUALLY BEING RECESS INCINERATED UNDER MUCH LESS ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY STANDARDS IN INDIANA IN INDONESIA AND ELSEWHERE SO. THIS IS WHY WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM BEEN SB FIFTY FOUR SO WITH THAT LET ME ADJOURNED -- THIS JOINT HEARING OF THE NATURAL RESOURCES AND A QUOTE FROM A QUALITY COMMITTEES.
