OTHER TO. MEANT TO PROJECT.

00:30:52.817 --> 00:30:55.253
APPROACHES THAT HAVE BEEN VERY-

00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:57.555
BENEFICIAL IN ALL MY DISTRICT

00:30:57.622 --> 00:30:59.924

THE GROUND WATER OFFERS IN FACT

00:31:07.832 --> 00:31:09.100
I THINK ORANGE COUNTY HAS BEEN

00:31:09.167 --> 00:31:10.768
THE LEADER IN THE USE OF

00:31:10.835 --> 00:31:12.637
RECYCLED WATER TO REPLENISH OF

00:31:12.704 --> 00:31:14.372

YOU COULD GIVE ME KIND OF YOUR

00:31:16.107 --> 00:31:18.042
IDEA ON THOSE TWO APPROACHES TO

YOU SEE. IN TERMS OF THE PROS

00:31:24.249 --> 00:31:25.683

YOU KNOW. WHAT WHAT ARE THE

00:31:36.227 --> 00:31:37.962
ISSUES THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED

00:31:38.029 --> 00:31:38.796
SO WE CAN MAKE THOSE TWO

00:31:38.863 --> 00:31:40.865
APPROACHES MAY BE. MORE POPULAR

00:31:40.932 --> 00:31:41.799
KNOWING THAT ISRAEL AT WHAT IS

00:31:41.866 --> 00:31:43.635
IT 55% OF THE WATER COMES FROM

00:31:43.701 --> 00:31:45.870
DIESEL PLANTS. SO WE NEED TO BE

00:31:45.937 --> 00:31:46.938

00:31:47.005 --> 00:31:49.073

A LOOK AT EACH AREA- AND- LOOK

00:32:12.263 --> 00:32:14.966
AT WHAT APPROACH WORKS BEST FOR

00:32:15.033 --> 00:32:16.934

REGULATIONS ARE NEEDED CERTAINLY

00:36:04.729 --> 00:36:06.397
ON THE CONSERVATION SIDE THAT I

00:36:06.464 --> 00:36:08.499
THINK INCENTIVES ARE NEEDED FOR

00:36:08.566 --> 00:36:10.067
OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO PURSUE

00:36:10.134 --> 00:36:12.370
THESE PROJECTS THAT WE KNOW- DO

00:36:12.436 --> 00:36:15.239
WORK- DIESEL AND JOB GROUNDWATER

00:36:15.306 --> 00:36:16.641
REPLENISHMENT VERY IMPORTANT

00:36:16.707 --> 00:36:18.543
VERY EXPENSIVE. SO I THINK THE

INCENTIVE CAN COME FROM THE

00:36:20.044 --> 00:36:21.913

00:36:31.522 --> 00:36:32.757
MANY I THINK CALL IT REALLY

00:36:32.823 --> 00:36:34.525

00:55:33.563 --> 00:55:34.698
PART OF THE DIFFICULTY IN THE

00:55:34.764 --> 00:55:36.733

THE PURVIEW OF THE AGENCY I ONCE

ABOUT YOUR OPENNESS BECAUSE I

00:56:02.025 --> 00:56:04.027

WITH THAT THAT IS GOING TO BE

00:56:05.962 --> 00:56:10.133
THE IMPORTANT THING. FOR GOING

00:56:10.200 --> 00:56:12.035
FORWARD. AND I THINK THAT THE

00:56:12.102 --> 00:56:13.036
MOST OF MARK. ASKED DIFFERENT

00:56:13.103 --> 00:56:14.337

A SEAT. THAT IS HELD FOR CIVIL

00:56:26.249 --> 00:56:28.251
