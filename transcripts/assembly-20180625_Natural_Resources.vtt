THERE REALLY ISN'T MUCH

00:30:44.176 --> 00:30:47.512 region:rollup2
SCIENTIFIC EXPERTISE NEEDED A

GLASS BOTTLE IS 1100% RECYCLED

00:30:47.512 --> 00:30:51.983 region:rollup2
WHAT WHAT THEY NEED IS EXPERTISE

00:30:49.514 --> 00:30:53.719 region:rollup2

THE LARGEST UP CRV CONTAINERS IS

00:31:30.055 --> 00:31:34.259 region:rollup2

RECYCLING OF PT CONTAINERS.

00:31:51.643 --> 00:31:55.781 region:rollup2
OUR PRIMARY OBJECTIVES ARE TO

00:31:53.712 --> 00:31:57.749 region:rollup2
INCREASE THE PUBLIC AWARENESS --

00:31:55.781 --> 00:31:58.917 region:rollup2

CALIFORNIA.

00:32:03.822 --> 00:32:07.692 region:rollup2
COME ALSO TO IN SCRIPT INCREASE

00:32:05.457 --> 00:32:08.326 region:rollup2
THE SCRAP VALUE PT AND TO REDUCE

00:32:07.692 --> 00:32:13.098 region:rollup2
THE COSTS OF COLLECTION AND ALSO

00:32:08.326 --> 00:32:14.299 region:rollup2
--

00:32:13.098 --> 00:32:15.367 region:rollup2
TO TO REDUCE THE COST OF THE

00:32:14.299 --> 00:32:18.470 region:rollup2
SYSTEM --

00:32:15.367 --> 00:32:19.905 region:rollup2
WHEAT PURCHASE OVER 40% OF THE

00:32:18.470 --> 00:32:21.807 region:rollup2
SCRAPPY T. BILLS THAT ARE

00:32:19.905 --> 00:32:23.341 region:rollup2
GENERATED IN CALIFORNIA.

00:32:21.807 --> 00:32:24.609 region:rollup2
A WE KNOW THERE IS NO MARKET

00:32:23.341 --> 00:32:26.144 region:rollup2
PROBLEMS WITH P. T. SCRIPT

00:32:24.609 --> 00:32:27.479 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE LIVE IT EVERY SINGLE

00:32:26.144 --> 00:32:28.146 region:rollup2
DAY.

00:32:27.479 --> 00:32:28.980 region:rollup2
THAT'S A LOT OF MATERIAL THAT WE

00:32:28.146 --> 00:32:32.017 region:rollup2
HANDLE --

00:32:28.980 --> 00:32:33.485 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF OUR WORK AND THE THE

00:32:32.017 --> 00:32:36.922 region:rollup2
BOTTLES GENERATING CALIFORNIA

00:32:33.485 --> 00:32:38.890 region:rollup2
WERE EVEN BEING SOLD TO CHINA --

00:32:36.922 --> 00:32:41.326 region:rollup2
THE IT USED TO BE A FIVE YEARS

00:32:38.890 --> 00:32:43.428 region:rollup2
AGO EIGHT YEARS AGO AT THE MOST

00:32:41.326 --> 00:32:44.629 region:rollup2
OF IT WAS SOLD BUT IN THE PAST

00:32:43.428 --> 00:32:46.231 region:rollup2
FEW YEARS THAT HAS REALLY

00:32:44.629 --> 00:32:47.999 region:rollup2
CHANGED AND NOW.

00:32:46.231 --> 00:32:50.368 region:rollup2
VERY VERY LITTLE OF IT ACTUALLY

00:32:47.999 --> 00:32:52.537 region:rollup2
WAS BEING SOLD TO CHINA --

00:32:50.368 --> 00:32:53.805 region:rollup2
WE ARE OPPOSED TO ONE SIXTY

00:32:52.537 --> 00:32:55.707 region:rollup2
EIGHT BECAUSE WHAT WE SEE IS THE

00:32:53.805 --> 00:32:57.442 region:rollup2
NEW ENORMOUS UNINTENDED

00:32:55.707 --> 00:32:58.910 region:rollup2
CONSEQUENCES OF THIS BILL.

00:32:57.442 --> 00:33:00.345 region:rollup2
A WELL IT MIGHT HELP SOME PEOPLE

00:32:58.910 --> 00:33:01.580 region:rollup2
YOU HEARD A COUPLE OF PEOPLE IT

00:33:00.345 --> 00:33:02.848 region:rollup2
WOULD HELP --

00:33:01.580 --> 00:33:04.649 region:rollup2
IT IS CERTAINLY GOING TO HARM

00:33:02.848 --> 00:33:06.017 region:rollup2
OTHERS FOR EXAMPLE MANY

00:33:04.649 --> 00:33:07.652 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES HAVE

00:33:06.017 --> 00:33:08.887 region:rollup2
INVESTED MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN

00:33:07.652 --> 00:33:10.422 region:rollup2
BUILDING THE INFRASTRUCTURE

00:33:08.887 --> 00:33:12.424 region:rollup2
NEEDED TO RECYCLE PT.

00:33:10.422 --> 00:33:15.193 region:rollup2
IN THE PACKAGING --

00:33:12.424 --> 00:33:17.062 region:rollup2
AS OPPOSED TO BOTTLES --

00:33:15.193 --> 00:33:18.830 region:rollup2
CRB BOTTLES OF THIS MANDATORY

00:33:17.062 --> 00:33:20.499 region:rollup2
APPROACH IT REALLY TARGETS A

00:33:18.830 --> 00:33:22.367 region:rollup2
VERY SMALL PERCENTAGE OF THE N.

00:33:20.499 --> 00:33:23.869 region:rollup2
USES FOR P. T..

00:33:22.367 --> 00:33:25.370 region:rollup2
OF WHAT ABOUT THE NON CRV

00:33:23.869 --> 00:33:26.671 region:rollup2
BOTTLES THERE'S A LOT OF THE

00:33:25.370 --> 00:33:28.473 region:rollup2
* R. V. BOTTLES THAT ARE

00:33:26.671 --> 00:33:28.907 region:rollup2
USING RECYCLED CONTENT TODAY

00:33:28.473 --> 00:33:32.310 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:33:28.907 --> 00:33:33.545 region:rollup2
THE TWO THAT WOULD THEN BE A COP

00:33:32.310 --> 00:33:35.146 region:rollup2
PLACED OUT OF THE MARKET.

00:33:33.545 --> 00:33:37.048 region:rollup2
A BECAUSE IT'S LIKELY GOING TO

00:33:35.146 --> 00:33:38.717 region:rollup2
INCREASE THE COST OF THE BALES

00:33:37.048 --> 00:33:41.219 region:rollup2
TO UNSUSTAINABLE LEVELS AND IT'S

00:33:38.717 --> 00:33:42.821 region:rollup2
GONNA HARM A HUGE PORTION OF THE

00:33:41.219 --> 00:33:44.456 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S ALREADY

00:33:42.821 --> 00:33:46.191 region:rollup2
BEEN BUILT IN THE STATE.

00:33:44.456 --> 00:33:48.627 region:rollup2
HOME THAT JADE THEY JUST DON'T

00:33:46.191 --> 00:33:50.028 region:rollup2
HAPPEN TO MAKE CRB BOTTLES AS

00:33:48.627 --> 00:33:51.696 region:rollup2
THEIR AND MARKET AND ASKING WHO

00:33:50.028 --> 00:33:53.064 region:rollup2
TRY TO WRAP UP I'M ALMOST DONE

00:33:51.696 --> 00:33:54.199 region:rollup2
HERE -- SO

00:33:53.064 --> 00:33:56.034 region:rollup2
WE THINK THAT --

00:33:54.199 --> 00:33:56.801 region:rollup2
IT WILL REDUCE THE QUALITYOF

00:33:56.034 --> 00:33:58.770 region:rollup2
THE BALES --

00:33:56.801 --> 00:34:00.338 region:rollup2
AND WE WOULD REALLY LIKE TO SEE

00:33:58.770 --> 00:34:03.174 region:rollup2
AN APPROACH THAT DOESN'T PICK

00:34:00.338 --> 00:34:04.476 region:rollup2
WINNERS AND LOSERS ONE THAT --

00:34:03.174 --> 00:34:06.344 region:rollup2
THAT WILL MEET THE GOALS BY

00:34:04.476 --> 00:34:08.013 region:rollup2
USING FOR EXAMPLE THE PLASTIC

00:34:06.344 --> 00:34:09.781 region:rollup2
MARKET DEVELOPMENT PAYMENT THEM

00:34:08.013 --> 00:34:12.183 region:rollup2
PROGRAM WHICH WE THINK THAT IT

00:34:09.781 --> 00:34:13.351 region:rollup2
WOULD WORK BETTER AS AS A A

00:34:12.183 --> 00:34:16.888 region:rollup2
CARROT RATHER THAN A STICK.

00:34:13.351 --> 00:34:17.789 region:rollup2

EUROPEANS ARE GOING 260% ON GAS

00:38:04.916 --> 00:38:07.152 region:rollup2
WEAKENED SOMEBODY CAN INTRODUCE

00:38:11.456 --> 00:38:15.160 region:rollup2
THAT THEY HAVE SOME EXPERTISE

00:38:13.057 --> 00:38:16.661 region:rollup2
THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE TAKING

00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:18.229 region:rollup2
THIS COMMITTEE ON THE STUDY.

00:38:16.661 --> 00:38:19.664 region:rollup2

PRODUCER RESPONSIBILITY AND SAYS

00:38:19.664 --> 00:38:23.902 region:rollup2
GO OUT AND LOOK AT OTHER STATES

FIND OUT WHAT'S WORKING WE'RE

00:38:23.902 --> 00:38:27.172 region:rollup2
NOT LOOKING FOR JUST EXTEND THE

00:38:25.537 --> 00:38:28.907 region:rollup2
PRODUCER RESPONSIBILITY AND AND

COME BACK TO US LET US KNOW.

00:38:28.907 --> 00:38:33.077 region:rollup2
IN SEE WHERE CAN WE FIX THE CAL

00:38:31.042 --> 00:38:34.879 region:rollup2
RECYCLE PROGRAM WHAT COULD WE BE

00:38:33.077 --> 00:38:36.714 region:rollup2
DOING BETTER ON ITS WITH SEARCH

00:38:34.879 --> 00:38:37.749 region:rollup2
TWO PRONGS THAT THIS ARM ON THE

00:38:36.714 --> 00:38:39.751 region:rollup2
ON THE CONTENT.

00:38:37.749 --> 00:38:41.252 region:rollup2
WE COULD THERE'S EVEN AFTER THIS

00:38:39.751 --> 00:38:42.253 region:rollup2
BILL IF WE COME BACK AND THEY

00:38:41.252 --> 00:38:44.355 region:rollup2
SAID BECAUSE WE KNOW THE

00:38:42.253 --> 00:38:46.291 region:rollup2
EUROPEANS ARE GOING 260% ON

00:38:44.355 --> 00:38:47.725 region:rollup2
GLASSES JUST LOOK AT CLASS WHERE

00:38:46.291 --> 00:38:49.327 region:rollup2
35% RIGHT NOW SO.

00:38:47.725 --> 00:38:51.829 region:rollup2
IF THEY CAME UP WITH A

00:38:49.327 --> 00:38:53.364 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATION BASED ON AND THEN

00:38:51.829 --> 00:38:55.366 region:rollup2
SOMEBODY ELSE IS DOING AND SAID

00:38:53.364 --> 00:38:56.668 region:rollup2
WE THINK YOU SHOULD GET.

00:38:55.366 --> 00:38:57.836 region:rollup2
TO FORTY WE COULD COME IN AND DO

00:38:56.668 --> 00:38:59.971 region:rollup2
A BILL THAT SAYS WELL WE WANT TO

00:38:57.836 --> 00:39:01.239 region:rollup2
GET TO FIFTY AND TWENTY THIRTY

00:38:59.971 --> 00:39:03.107 region:rollup2
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT THERE'S

00:39:01.239 --> 00:39:04.609 region:rollup2
NOTHING THAT PROHIBITS.

00:39:03.107 --> 00:39:05.777 region:rollup2
ARE TAKING ACTION IN THE BILL.

00:39:04.609 --> 00:39:07.245 region:rollup2
I JUST THOUGHT IT WOULD BE

00:39:05.777 --> 00:39:08.880 region:rollup2
BETTER TO LET THE EXPERTS DO IT.

00:39:07.245 --> 00:39:10.982 region:rollup2
OKAY SO IF MISTER CHAIRMAN IF I

00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:14.152 region:rollup2
MAY JUST --

00:39:10.982 --> 00:39:16.020 region:rollup2
TO EXPAND UPON THAT CAL RECYCLE.

00:39:14.152 --> 00:39:17.155 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW IS FARR'S.

00:39:16.020 --> 00:39:19.724 region:rollup2
SOME OF THEIR PRODUCTS THAT THEY

00:39:17.155 --> 00:39:21.192 region:rollup2
ARE RECYCLING THERE ONE DAY

00:39:19.724 --> 00:39:22.093 region:rollup2
THEIR SOLVENT THE NEXT DAY

00:39:21.192 --> 00:39:23.494 region:rollup2
THEY'RE NOT THE UP AND DOWN

00:39:22.093 --> 00:39:25.129 region:rollup2
THERE OLIVER THE PLACE AND YOU

00:39:23.494 --> 00:39:26.831 region:rollup2
WANT TO GIVE THEM THE AUTHORITY

00:39:25.129 --> 00:39:28.600 region:rollup2
TO DECIDE.

00:39:26.831 --> 00:39:30.101 region:rollup2
WHAT WOULD BE BEST JUST?

00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:31.636 region:rollup2
FAR IS SEEN A WHAT LEVEL SHOULD

00:39:30.101 --> 00:39:32.637 region:rollup2
BE SET I'M JUST I'M WONDERING

00:39:31.636 --> 00:39:35.773 region:rollup2
WHERE THAT LEVEL OF CONFIDENCE

00:39:32.637 --> 00:39:37.842 region:rollup2
IS COMING FROM THE CONSIDERING.

00:39:35.773 --> 00:39:39.577 region:rollup2
PARTY I MEAN TO BE FAIR BUBBLE.

00:39:37.842 --> 00:39:41.312 region:rollup2
THE AMENDMENTS THAT I'M TAKING

00:39:39.577 --> 00:39:43.114 region:rollup2
IN THE COMMITTEE ALLOW CALORIE

00:39:41.312 --> 00:39:45.216 region:rollup2
CYCLE TO ADJUST IT BASED ON THE

00:39:43.114 --> 00:39:46.885 region:rollup2
PRICE OF OUR OIL BASED ON THESE

00:39:45.216 --> 00:39:48.386 region:rollup2
MARKET CONDITIONS WHICH THEY

00:39:46.885 --> 00:39:49.621 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY DON'T HAVE SAID THAT'S

00:39:48.386 --> 00:39:51.556 region:rollup2
AN AMENDMENT THAT I ACCEPTED IN

00:39:49.621 --> 00:39:52.890 region:rollup2
THE IN THE BILL TODAY TO ALLOW

00:39:51.556 --> 00:39:54.359 region:rollup2
THEM TO DO THAT LITTLE.

00:39:52.890 --> 00:39:56.294 region:rollup2
THAT MODULATION SO IT'S NOT

00:39:54.359 --> 00:39:58.496 region:rollup2
STUCK IN BOULDER STONE I THINK

00:39:56.294 --> 00:40:00.765 region:rollup2
STILL WELL MAYBE GOLD ISSUES BUT

00:39:58.496 --> 00:40:03.201 region:rollup2
IT IS THE NUMBER THEY CAN MODIFY

00:40:00.765 --> 00:40:04.569 region:rollup2
BASED ON THESE MARKET CONDITIONS

00:40:03.201 --> 00:40:05.670 region:rollup2
AND AS WE GET THE INFORMATION

00:40:04.569 --> 00:40:07.605 region:rollup2
BACK FROM THIS STUDY.

00:40:05.670 --> 00:40:09.774 region:rollup2
PERHAPS WILL IMPROVE ON IT AGAIN

00:40:07.605 --> 00:40:11.676 region:rollup2
SO IT'S NOT STATIC IS NOT STATIC

00:40:09.774 --> 00:40:13.344 region:rollup2
BUT WE WANT TO WE WANT TO GET

00:40:11.676 --> 00:40:14.345 region:rollup2
MORE RECYCLING ONE HAVE THESE

00:40:13.344 --> 00:40:15.046 region:rollup2
MARKETS THAT THEY'RE TALKING

00:40:14.345 --> 00:40:16.648 region:rollup2
ABOUT.

00:40:15.046 --> 00:40:18.082 region:rollup2
BE MORE ROBUST IN WE GET THAT

00:40:16.648 --> 00:40:19.083 region:rollup2
INFORMATION BACK SO THAT'S THE

00:40:18.082 --> 00:40:20.585 region:rollup2
THAT'S THE ADJUSTMENT THAT WE

00:40:19.083 --> 00:40:22.954 region:rollup2
MADE WITH THAT TO ANSWER TO

00:40:20.585 --> 00:40:23.988 region:rollup2

01:04:52.622 --> 01:04:55.291 region:rollup2
WILL.

01:04:53.656 --> 01:04:56.793 region:rollup2
IT CREATES A WALL IN A SO THAT

01:04:55.291 --> 01:04:58.795 region:rollup2
NEW.

01:04:56.793 --> 01:04:59.429 region:rollup2
OR EXPANDED LEASING OFF OF OUR

01:04:58.795 --> 01:05:02.165 region:rollup2
FEDERAL WATERS CANNOT WE CANNOT

01:04:59.429 --> 01:05:03.967 region:rollup2
--

01:05:02.165 --> 01:05:05.769 region:rollup2
DEVELOP NEW INFRASTRUCTURE TO

01:05:03.967 --> 01:05:08.805 region:rollup2
ACCOMMODATE THOUGHT THAT

01:05:05.769 --> 01:05:10.907 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL OIL SO.

01:05:08.805 --> 01:05:14.110 region:rollup2
SO I UNDERSTAND --

01:05:10.907 --> 01:05:16.146 region:rollup2
THE POSITION THAT YOU AND THOSE

01:05:14.110 --> 01:05:18.014 region:rollup2
LIKE YOU HAVE RELATING TO OPTION

01:05:16.146 --> 01:05:19.582 region:rollup2
OFF SHORE DRILLING I DO --

01:05:18.014 --> 01:05:20.950 region:rollup2
I I DISAGREE BUT I CERTAINLY

01:05:19.582 --> 01:05:23.520 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND IT WHAT I DON'T

01:05:20.950 --> 01:05:24.154 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND IS IF THESE TYPES OF

01:05:23.520 --> 01:05:27.423 region:rollup2
RESTRICTIONS ARE PUT INTO PLACE

01:05:24.154 --> 01:05:30.560 region:rollup2
--

01:05:27.423 --> 01:05:34.097 region:rollup2
THEN WHERE WILL THE FUEL SOURCE

01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:35.799 region:rollup2
THAT SO MANY RELY ON COME FROM.

01:05:34.097 --> 01:05:37.333 region:rollup2
ELECTRIC VEHICLES CRIME

01:05:35.799 --> 01:05:39.936 region:rollup2
DELIGHTED TO HAVE ONE I HAVEN'T

01:05:37.333 --> 01:05:42.806 region:rollup2
HAD TO PUMP A DIME'S WORTH OF

01:05:39.936 --> 01:05:44.174 region:rollup2
GAS IN MY OF CAR TO SINCE I

01:05:42.806 --> 01:05:45.508 region:rollup2
PURCHASED IT A ON EVERYBODY HAS

01:05:44.174 --> 01:05:46.876 region:rollup2
AN ELECTRIC VEHICLE WILL

01:05:45.508 --> 01:05:47.811 region:rollup2
HOPEFULLY WILL START MOVING IN

01:05:46.876 --> 01:05:49.212 region:rollup2
THAT DIRECTION WE'RE NOT

01:05:47.811 --> 01:05:50.346 region:rollup2
STOPPING OIL DRILLING.

01:05:49.212 --> 01:05:51.948 region:rollup2
WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS WE DON'T

01:05:50.346 --> 01:05:53.316 region:rollup2
WANT TO EXPAND IT THERE ARE

01:05:51.948 --> 01:05:55.785 region:rollup2
OTHER TECHNOLOGIES THAT WE

01:05:53.316 --> 01:05:57.420 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE DEVELOPING TODAY BUT

01:05:55.785 --> 01:05:59.389 region:rollup2
TO REPLACE THE FOSSIL FUELS

01:05:57.420 --> 01:06:00.323 region:rollup2
SENATOR CREATING THE PROBLEM IN

01:05:59.389 --> 01:06:02.258 region:rollup2
OUR CLIMATE AND ENERGY?

01:06:00.323 --> 01:06:04.727 region:rollup2
I UNDERSTAND THAT BUT AS YOU

01:06:02.258 --> 01:06:06.863 region:rollup2
KNOW CALIFORNIA'S POPULATION

01:06:04.727 --> 01:06:09.966 region:rollup2
CONTINUES TO GROW RIGHT SO THERE

01:06:06.863 --> 01:06:11.568 region:rollup2
IS OUR NEED INCREASES --

01:06:09.966 --> 01:06:14.103 region:rollup2
AS OUR POPULATION GROWS IT

01:06:11.568 --> 01:06:16.039 region:rollup2
DOESN'T DECREASE SO I KNOW THAT

01:06:14.103 --> 01:06:17.474 region:rollup2
THERE IS AN EFFORT TO USE MORE

01:06:16.039 --> 01:06:18.775 region:rollup2
RENEWABLE ENERGY.

01:06:17.474 --> 01:06:21.110 region:rollup2
AND BUT WE CERTAINLY CAN'T OUR

01:06:18.775 --> 01:06:23.379 region:rollup2
WHOLE PORTFOLIO CANNOT RELY

01:06:21.110 --> 01:06:24.647 region:rollup2
SOLELY ON RENEWABLE ENERGY IT

01:06:23.379 --> 01:06:27.317 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY DOESN'T EXIST RIGHT

01:06:24.647 --> 01:06:28.184 region:rollup2
NOW I MEAN FOR US TO BE ABLE TO

01:06:27.317 --> 01:06:30.420 region:rollup2
DO SO SO I'M JUST.

01:06:28.184 --> 01:06:31.688 region:rollup2
I FEEL LIKE.

01:06:30.420 --> 01:06:33.656 region:rollup2
YOU HAVEN'T THOUGHT THIS THROUGH

01:06:31.688 --> 01:06:35.625 region:rollup2
WITH RESPECT TO THE COST THAT

01:06:33.656 --> 01:06:38.027 region:rollup2
WILL BE TO CALIFORNIA MOTORIST

01:06:35.625 --> 01:06:40.530 region:rollup2
AND BUSINESSES AND THOSE WHO

01:06:38.027 --> 01:06:42.499 region:rollup2
WORK IN THESE --

01:06:40.530 --> 01:06:44.667 region:rollup2
IN THIS INDUSTRY.

01:06:42.499 --> 01:06:45.602 region:rollup2
I JUST FEEL LIKE IT'S THAT

01:06:44.667 --> 01:06:45.902 region:rollup2
WASN'T EVEN CONSIDERED

01:06:45.602 --> 01:06:47.136 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

01:06:45.902 --> 01:06:49.572 region:rollup2
WELL.

01:06:47.136 --> 01:06:51.541 region:rollup2
IF YOU HEARD WHAT I SAID.

01:06:49.572 --> 01:06:52.542 region:rollup2
I SAID WE'RE NOT STOPPING OIL

01:06:51.541 --> 01:06:54.043 region:rollup2
DRILLING WHICH ASSERTING WE'RE

01:06:52.542 --> 01:06:56.112 region:rollup2
NOT GOING TO WE'RE NOT GOING TO

01:06:54.043 --> 01:06:57.881 region:rollup2
ALLOW IT TO BE EXPANDED BEYOND

01:06:56.112 --> 01:06:59.449 region:rollup2
AND RIGHT NOW FRANKLY OUR

01:06:57.881 --> 01:07:01.384 region:rollup2
REFINERIES OR A CAPACITY.

01:06:59.449 --> 01:07:03.486 region:rollup2
SO IT'S NOT LIKE WE DON'T HAVE

01:07:01.384 --> 01:07:05.855 region:rollup2
OIL BEING DRILLED BUT WHAT WE DO

01:07:03.486 --> 01:07:08.024 region:rollup2
HAVE IS THE POSSIBILITY OF

01:07:05.855 --> 01:07:09.859 region:rollup2
WEANING OURSELVES OFF OF OIL

01:07:08.024 --> 01:07:11.528 region:rollup2
OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS. TO

01:07:09.859 --> 01:07:14.030 region:rollup2
USE OTHER.

01:07:11.528 --> 01:07:15.798 region:rollup2
NON FOSSIL FUEL ENERGY SOURCES

01:07:14.030 --> 01:07:18.134 region:rollup2
SO THAT WE CAN.

01:07:15.798 --> 01:07:19.702 region:rollup2
WE CAN STOP WORK CLIMATE CHANGE

01:07:18.134 --> 01:07:21.704 region:rollup2
FOR EXAMPLE WHEAT YOU KNOW ALL

01:07:19.702 --> 01:07:24.507 region:rollup2
THE EXPERTS ACKNOWLEDGE THAT

01:07:21.704 --> 01:07:28.011 region:rollup2
THIS IS BASED UPON FOSSIL FUELS.

01:07:24.507 --> 01:07:29.546 region:rollup2
AND WE ARE HOPEFULLY GOING --

01:07:28.011 --> 01:07:31.781 region:rollup2
TO REDUCE AND ULTIMATELY

01:07:29.546 --> 01:07:33.917 region:rollup2
TRANSFER --

01:07:31.781 --> 01:07:37.287 region:rollup2
AS TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE TO THE

01:07:33.917 --> 01:07:39.088 region:rollup2
NON A INVASIVE NON --

01:07:37.287 --> 01:07:40.657 region:rollup2
FOSSIL BASED FUELS LIKE I

01:07:39.088 --> 01:07:42.492 region:rollup2
MENTIONED ELECTRIC CARS WERE

01:07:40.657 --> 01:07:44.294 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT HYDROGEN THERE ARE

01:07:42.492 --> 01:07:45.428 region:rollup2
ALL SORTS OF NEW OPPORTUNITIES

01:07:44.294 --> 01:07:47.964 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE SO WE CAN WEAN

01:07:45.428 --> 01:07:49.365 region:rollup2
OURSELVES OFF WHAT WE KNOW IS A

01:07:47.964 --> 01:07:51.634 region:rollup2
DIRTY FORM OF ENERGY.

01:07:49.365 --> 01:07:54.671 region:rollup2
AND THIS BILL DOESN'T STOP US IT

01:07:51.634 --> 01:07:56.439 region:rollup2
DOESN'T AFFECT A THE THE NUMBER

01:07:54.671 --> 01:07:59.108 region:rollup2
OF PEOPLE WHO ARE --

01:07:56.439 --> 01:08:00.209 region:rollup2
IN OUR STATE OF PEOPLE CAN START

01:07:59.108 --> 01:08:01.844 region:rollup2
USING ALTERNATIVE FORMS OF

01:08:00.209 --> 01:08:03.246 region:rollup2
TRANSPORTATION THAT'S SOMETHING

01:08:01.844 --> 01:08:05.648 region:rollup2
ELSE WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT.

01:08:03.246 --> 01:08:06.950 region:rollup2
A RAIL FOR EXAMPLE GET PEOPLE

01:08:05.648 --> 01:08:09.419 region:rollup2
OUT OF THEIR CARS LOT MORE

01:08:06.950 --> 01:08:11.220 region:rollup2
PEOPLE ARE BICYCLING TO AND FROM

01:08:09.419 --> 01:08:13.156 region:rollup2
WHERE DEVELOPING TECHNIQUES THAT

01:08:11.220 --> 01:08:14.057 region:rollup2
WILL HELP US WIN OURSELVES OFF

01:08:13.156 --> 01:08:16.492 region:rollup2
OF THIS.

01:08:14.057 --> 01:08:17.627 region:rollup2
A DIRTY FOSSIL FUEL AND THE

01:08:16.492 --> 01:08:19.762 region:rollup2
NOTION THAT WE WOULD WANT TO

01:08:17.627 --> 01:08:21.397 region:rollup2
EXPAND IT WHEN WE KNOW IT'S

01:08:19.762 --> 01:08:24.133 region:rollup2
IMPACT THAT WE WOULD WANT TO

01:08:21.397 --> 01:08:26.202 region:rollup2
ALLOW IT TO TO GROW IN ITS USAGE

01:08:24.133 --> 01:08:27.470 region:rollup2
IS ANATHEMA. TO THE POLICIES OF

SERVICES THAT ARE THERE.

01:32:18.900 --> 01:32:22.437 region:rollup2
THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO FUNCTION

AND OPERATE IN THE WAY THAT WAS

01:32:22.437 --> 01:32:25.607 region:rollup2
INTENDED BUT THEN STOP THAT

01:32:24.272 --> 01:32:26.975 region:rollup2

01:32:25.607 --> 01:32:28.777 region:rollup2
THE THEFT OF WHAT WOULD BE

01:32:26.975 --> 01:32:30.178 region:rollup2
EXPECTED WHEN THAT FRANCHISE

THAT'S WHERE WE HAVE TO BE

01:32:54.102 --> 01:32:57.072 region:rollup2

COMMITTEE STAFF HAD.

01:59:56.456 --> 02:00:01.528 region:rollup2
WHICH WHEN SWEET WE'VE JUST NOT

01:59:59.893 --> 02:00:02.796 region:rollup2
LANDED ON THAT LANGUAGE WE'VE

02:00:01.528 --> 02:00:04.597 region:rollup2
WE'VE STARTED TO LOOK AT SIMON

02:00:02.796 --> 02:00:07.100 region:rollup2
WE'RE GETTING CLOSE BUT WE WOULD

02:00:04.597 --> 02:00:09.703 region:rollup2
TAKE THAT LANGUAGE IN APPROACH

02:00:07.100 --> 02:00:10.870 region:rollup2
WOULD WHATEVER WE AGREE TO WITH.

02:00:09.703 --> 02:00:12.839 region:rollup2

DETAILS I CAN DO IN MY CLOTHES.

02:01:00.987 --> 02:01:03.556 region:rollup2
FULLER MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS

02:01:02.522 --> 02:01:05.058 region:rollup2
THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE MY

02:01:03.556 --> 02:01:06.426 region:rollup2
NAME IS JACK BRAUER I'M A

02:01:05.058 --> 02:01:08.261 region:rollup2
PROFESSOR IN MECHANICAL AND

02:01:06.426 --> 02:01:10.196 region:rollup2
AEROSPACE ENGINEERING AT THE

02:01:08.261 --> 02:01:12.365 region:rollup2
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA IRVINE.

02:01:10.196 --> 02:01:14.834 region:rollup2
I DO RESEARCH ON THE DYNAMICS OF

02:01:12.365 --> 02:01:15.902 region:rollup2
RENEWABLE ENERGY AND ALSO ON

02:01:14.834 --> 02:01:18.138 region:rollup2
ELECTRIC CHEMICAL ENERGY

02:01:15.902 --> 02:01:19.439 region:rollup2
CONVERSION AND STORAGE.

02:01:18.138 --> 02:01:22.375 region:rollup2
AND I'VE BEEN INVESTIGATING ALL

02:01:19.439 --> 02:01:23.443 region:rollup2
KINDS OF FORMS OF STORAGE --

02:01:22.375 --> 02:01:25.111 region:rollup2
THAT INCLUDE BATTERIES AND

02:01:23.443 --> 02:01:27.580 region:rollup2
ELECTROLYSIS AND HYDROGEN AND

02:01:25.111 --> 02:01:29.549 region:rollup2
PUMP HYDRO AND HEART DISEASE.

02:01:27.580 --> 02:01:31.851 region:rollup2
AND I DON'T KNOW OF ANY OTHER

02:01:29.549 --> 02:01:34.954 region:rollup2
FORM OF STORAGE THAT WOULD

02:01:31.851 --> 02:01:38.124 region:rollup2
ENABLE THE FEATURES WE NEED. FOR

02:01:34.954 --> 02:01:39.893 region:rollup2
MASSIVE AND EVEN A 100%

02:01:38.124 --> 02:01:41.094 region:rollup2
RENEWABLE ENERGY ECONOMIES

02:01:39.893 --> 02:01:42.328 region:rollup2
THERE'S NO OTHER THING THAT CAN

02:01:41.094 --> 02:01:44.764 region:rollup2
DO THAT WITH ZERO EMISSIONS.

02:01:42.328 --> 02:01:47.233 region:rollup2
OTHER THAN HYDROGEN.

02:01:44.764 --> 02:01:49.636 region:rollup2
HYDROGEN IS THAT --

02:01:47.233 --> 02:01:51.404 region:rollup2
ONE HAS THESE FEATURES THAT CAN

02:01:49.636 --> 02:01:53.406 region:rollup2
ENABLE LONG TERM.

02:01:51.404 --> 02:01:56.009 region:rollup2
AND MASSIVE ENERGY STORAGE THAT

02:01:53.406 --> 02:01:58.578 region:rollup2
WE WILL EVENTUALLY NEED FOR A

02:01:56.009 --> 02:02:01.247 region:rollup2
100% RENEWABLE ECONOMY --

02:01:58.578 --> 02:02:03.116 region:rollup2
IT ALSO ENDS UP BEING A VERY

02:02:01.247 --> 02:02:04.784 region:rollup2
GOOD TOOL FOR D. CARBON ISING

02:02:03.116 --> 02:02:06.219 region:rollup2
WHAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE AS OUR

02:02:04.784 --> 02:02:07.587 region:rollup2
GAS INFRASTRUCTURE IT'S ONE OF

02:02:06.219 --> 02:02:09.856 region:rollup2
THE ONLY WAYS IN WHICH WE CAN DO

02:02:07.587 --> 02:02:12.258 region:rollup2
IT ON A MASSIVE SCALE.

02:02:09.856 --> 02:02:13.960 region:rollup2
EVEN IF WE USED ALL THE BIO GAS

02:02:12.258 --> 02:02:15.361 region:rollup2
AND BIOMASS THAT'S AVAILABLE TO

02:02:13.960 --> 02:02:16.563 region:rollup2
US WE COULDN'T DE CARBONIZED IT

02:02:15.361 --> 02:02:18.164 region:rollup2
COMPLETELY [inaudible]

02:02:16.563 --> 02:02:20.200 region:rollup2
BUT HYDROGEN.

02:02:18.164 --> 02:02:22.569 region:rollup2
MADE FROM RENEWABLE ENERGY COULD

02:02:20.200 --> 02:02:23.169 region:rollup2
DO THAT FOR US.

02:02:22.569 --> 02:02:24.337 region:rollup2
FINALLY I JUST WANT TO MENTION

02:02:23.169 --> 02:02:26.472 region:rollup2
THAT.

02:02:24.337 --> 02:02:29.842 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY IF WE GO ON THE SAME

02:02:26.472 --> 02:02:31.644 region:rollup2
PATH OF ELECTRIFYING EVERYTHING.

02:02:29.842 --> 02:02:33.012 region:rollup2
AND TRYING TO MEET ALL THE

02:02:31.644 --> 02:02:35.415 region:rollup2
DEMANDS WE CURRENTLY MEET WITH

02:02:33.012 --> 02:02:37.350 region:rollup2
BOTH GAS AND ELECTRICITY WE

02:02:35.415 --> 02:02:39.752 region:rollup2
WOULD HAVE TO MORE THAN TRIPLE.

02:02:37.350 --> 02:02:41.621 region:rollup2
OUR ELECTRIC INFRASTRUCTURE.

02:02:39.752 --> 02:02:44.624 region:rollup2
THIS IDEA OF MAKING HYDROGEN

02:02:41.621 --> 02:02:46.326 region:rollup2
FROM RENEWABLES ENABLES US TO

02:02:44.624 --> 02:02:48.328 region:rollup2
ELECTRIFY EVEN THOSE VERY

02:02:46.326 --> 02:02:50.897 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT TO ELECTRIFY END USES

02:02:48.328 --> 02:02:51.431 region:rollup2
THE MASSIVE AMOUNT OF STORAGE WE

02:02:50.897 --> 02:02:53.499 region:rollup2
NEED.

02:02:51.431 --> 02:02:55.602 region:rollup2
THE HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES AND

02:02:53.499 --> 02:02:58.204 region:rollup2
THINGS LIKE THIS --

02:02:55.602 --> 02:02:59.138 region:rollup2
AND OFFERS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US

02:02:58.204 --> 02:03:01.741 region:rollup2
TO DO THIS IN A WAY THAT'S A

02:02:59.138 --> 02:03:03.443 region:rollup2
MUCH LESS COSTLY.

02:03:01.741 --> 02:03:05.778 region:rollup2
THAN TRYING TO REPLACE ALL OF

02:03:03.443 --> 02:03:07.847 region:rollup2
THOSE CURRENT GAS PLANTS THINGS

02:03:05.778 --> 02:03:11.017 region:rollup2
LIKE THAT TO REPURPOSE THOSE

02:03:07.847 --> 02:03:14.721 region:rollup2
THINGS OKAY WITH ZERO OMITTING.

02:03:11.017 --> 02:03:20.326 region:rollup2
HYDROGEN FROM RENEWABLES.

02:03:14.721 --> 02:03:22.095 region:rollup2
I URGE YOUR SUPPORT.

02:03:20.326 --> 02:03:23.696 region:rollup2
IT'S HARD TO FOLLOW THAT.

02:03:22.095 --> 02:03:25.031 region:rollup2
LORRAINE PASS GADSON WITH BUT

WE GENERATE MORE RENEWABLE

02:07:17.396 --> 02:07:20.500 region:rollup2
ELECTRICITY THERE ARE TIMES IN

02:07:18.865 --> 02:07:22.034 region:rollup2

STANDARD.

02:14:11.343 --> 02:14:15.514 region:rollup2
TODAY WE ARE AHEAD OF OUR

02:14:13.512 --> 02:14:16.849 region:rollup2
SCHEDULED TO GET 250% RENEWABLE

02:14:15.514 --> 02:14:20.719 region:rollup2
ELECTRICITY [inaudible]

02:14:16.849 --> 02:14:22.821 region:rollup2
BY [inaudible] TWENTY THIRTY IN

02:14:20.719 --> 02:14:23.789 region:rollup2
LIGHT OF THIS PROGRESS STUDIES

02:14:22.821 --> 02:14:25.758 region:rollup2
SHOW THAT NATURAL GAS WILL

02:14:23.789 --> 02:14:35.634 region:rollup2
CONTINUE.

02:14:25.758 --> 02:14:36.268 region:rollup2
A PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE.

02:14:35.634 --> 02:14:36.936 region:rollup2
AS A RELIABLE FUEL SOURCE FOR

02:14:36.268 --> 02:14:37.570 region:rollup2
HEAT AND ELECTRICITY GENERATION.

02:14:36.936 --> 02:14:37.937 region:rollup2
WE'VE SANE AND SOME CASES AS

02:14:37.570 --> 02:14:40.940 region:rollup2
WE'VE RETOOLED.

02:14:37.937 --> 02:14:42.741 region:rollup2

THIS YOU KNOW WE KNOW THAT.

02:14:42.741 --> 02:14:45.544 region:rollup2
THERE ARE SOME STRATEGIES THAT

02:14:44.343 --> 02:14:48.347 region:rollup2
WOULD LIKE TO SEE A FUTURE

02:14:45.544 --> 02:14:50.382 region:rollup2
WITHOUT GAS BUT THAT IS VERY

02:14:48.347 --> 02:14:52.184 region:rollup2
VERY FAR IN THE FUTURE.

02:14:50.382 --> 02:14:54.353 region:rollup2
TODAY WE CAN ACTUALLY.

02:14:52.184 --> 02:14:56.121 region:rollup2
IF AT ALL ACTUALLY BECAUSE TODAY

02:14:54.353 --> 02:14:58.757 region:rollup2
WE WE ARE NOW SEEING THAT GAS.

02:14:56.121 --> 02:15:00.726 region:rollup2
IS NOT ONLY --

02:14:58.757 --> 02:15:02.561 region:rollup2
CLEANER THAN MANY FUEL SOURCES

02:15:00.726 --> 02:15:04.330 region:rollup2
BUT ACTUALLY HAS A NEGATIVE.

02:15:02.561 --> 02:15:05.998 region:rollup2
CARBON FOOTPRINT.

02:15:04.330 --> 02:15:07.800 region:rollup2
WE'RE SEEING THAT --

02:15:05.998 --> 02:15:10.869 region:rollup2
WERE SEQUESTERING GAS THAT.

02:15:07.800 --> 02:15:12.137 region:rollup2
AT A LANDFILLS AND IN --

02:15:10.869 --> 02:15:15.207 region:rollup2
GARY FARMS DIFFERENT PLATE PARTS

02:15:12.137 --> 02:15:17.209 region:rollup2
OF THE OF THE STATE.

02:15:15.207 --> 02:15:19.778 region:rollup2
AND WE CAN USE THAT SEQUESTERED

02:15:17.209 --> 02:15:20.379 region:rollup2
GAS INTO OF FUEL.

02:15:19.778 --> 02:15:23.248 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD HELP US ACTUALLY

02:15:20.379 --> 02:15:25.284 region:rollup2
CLEAN THE EARTH CLEAN THE AIR

02:15:23.248 --> 02:15:26.919 region:rollup2

THIS IS ONE STRATEGY OF

02:15:32.858 --> 02:15:35.561 region:rollup2
ACHIEVING CALIFORNIA'S IN ENERGY

02:15:35.060 --> 02:15:37.196 region:rollup2
INDEPENDENCE WHY IS THAT

02:15:35.561 --> 02:15:38.797 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT.

02:15:37.196 --> 02:15:40.532 region:rollup2
THE MORE MONEY WE SPEND.

02:15:38.797 --> 02:15:42.568 region:rollup2

02:15:40.532 --> 02:15:45.304 region:rollup2
MEANS THE MORE.

02:15:42.568 --> 02:15:47.806 region:rollup2

IN THE WORLD.

02:16:00.586 --> 02:16:04.089 region:rollup2
AND WE GOT THERE.

02:16:02.521 --> 02:16:05.290 region:rollup2
BY MAKING INVESTMENTS WITHIN OUR

02:16:05.290 --> 02:16:08.660 region:rollup2
PRODUCES THINGS.

02:16:06.959 --> 02:16:11.163 region:rollup2
AND THAT WE CONSUME CALIFORNIA

02:16:08.660 --> 02:16:13.399 region:rollup2
GROWN PRODUCTS.

02:16:11.163 --> 02:16:15.100 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW 80% OF OUR NATURAL GAS

02:16:13.399 --> 02:16:17.036 region:rollup2
COMES FROM OUTSIDE THE STATE.

02:16:15.100 --> 02:16:18.671 region:rollup2
THAT IS AN ENORMOUS AMOUNTOF

02:16:17.036 --> 02:16:20.139 region:rollup2
MONEY LEAVING OUR ECONOMY EVERY

THERE IS AN ANALYSIS DONE BY THE

02:19:45.844 --> 02:19:48.814 region:rollup2

AS COST EFFECTIVELY AVAILABLE?

02:20:04.563 --> 02:20:06.865 region:rollup2
CURRENT ESTIMATES THAT ORGANIC

02:20:05.831 --> 02:20:08.667 region:rollup2
WASTE CAN SUPPLY ENOUGH

02:20:06.865 --> 02:20:10.335 region:rollup2

WITHIN THE GAS PIPELINES OR A

02:33:15.286 --> 02:33:19.857 region:rollup2
CERTAIN LEVEL OF QUALITY OF GAS.

02:33:18.222 --> 02:33:21.459 region:rollup2
THE NEEDS TO BE USED --

02:33:19.857 --> 02:33:22.727 region:rollup2
WE CAN JUST PUT ANY KIND OF GAS

02:33:21.459 --> 02:33:24.395 region:rollup2
IN THERE OTHERWISE IT WOULD

02:33:22.727 --> 02:33:25.563 region:rollup2
DAMAGE.

02:33:24.395 --> 02:33:29.100 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW STOVES AND ANYTHING

02:33:25.563 --> 02:33:31.502 region:rollup2
THAT BURNS ON NATURAL GAS SO.

02:33:29.100 --> 02:33:34.172 region:rollup2
SOME PEOPLE DON'T PRODUCE

02:33:31.502 --> 02:33:34.806 region:rollup2
NATURAL GAS AT THAT QUALITY.

02:33:34.172 --> 02:33:36.040 region:rollup2
THEY WANT TO BE INCLUDED IN THIS

02:33:34.806 --> 02:33:38.776 region:rollup2
BILL.

02:33:36.040 --> 02:33:39.377 region:rollup2
AND THERE YOU KNOW I THINK.

02:33:38.776 --> 02:33:42.480 region:rollup2
IT'S IMPORTANT I I I THINK IF

02:33:39.377 --> 02:33:43.614 region:rollup2
IF.

02:33:42.480 --> 02:33:45.016 region:rollup2
THEIR ARE SOME PEOPLE STILL HAVE

02:33:43.614 --> 02:33:47.018 region:rollup2
DEVELOPED TECHNOLOGIES THAT

02:33:45.016 --> 02:33:48.186 region:rollup2
ALLOW THEM TO CLEAN GLASS CAST

02:33:47.018 --> 02:33:49.787 region:rollup2
AT THAT LEVEL BUT I I BELIEVE.

02:33:48.186 --> 02:33:52.290 region:rollup2
THAT IF.

02:33:49.787 --> 02:33:54.292 region:rollup2
IF THIS BILL.

02:33:52.290 --> 02:33:56.027 region:rollup2
HAS HAS A REQUIREMENT TO PICTURE

02:33:54.292 --> 02:33:59.864 region:rollup2
THE GASES IS CLEAN.

02:33:56.027 --> 02:34:02.100 region:rollup2
AND AN EFFECTIVE AND AND USEFUL.

02:33:59.864 --> 02:34:03.034 region:rollup2
WITHIN THE THE YOU KNOW THEY'RE

02:34:02.100 --> 02:34:05.436 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT REQUIREMENTS IN

02:34:05.436 --> 02:34:08.372 region:rollup2
AND SO --

02:34:06.471 --> 02:34:09.807 region:rollup2

02:34:08.372 --> 02:34:11.576 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENTS AND AND THAT'S

02:34:09.807 --> 02:34:13.377 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT.

02:34:11.576 --> 02:34:14.545 region:rollup2
THAT HAS BEEN WORKED ON BY.

02:34:13.377 --> 02:34:16.080 region:rollup2
BY DIFFERENT --

02:34:14.545 --> 02:34:17.949 region:rollup2
COMMISSIONS THAT.

02:34:16.080 --> 02:34:19.484 region:rollup2

IN THE OPEN THE WATER EITHER --

02:54:46.209 --> 02:54:49.779 region:rollup2
BUT I'M JUST WONDERING.

02:54:48.178 --> 02:54:51.948 region:rollup2
EVERY CITY CAN ENACT THEIR OWN

02:54:49.779 --> 02:54:52.549 region:rollup2
ORDINANCES AND SAY YOU KNOW WE

02:54:51.948 --> 02:54:53.917 region:rollup2

02:54:52.549 --> 02:54:55.352 region:rollup2
MATERIAL --

02:54:53.917 --> 02:54:57.354 region:rollup2
BEING USED IN OUR CITY BECAUSE

02:54:55.352 --> 02:54:58.722 region:rollup2
WE'RE SO CLOSE TO WATER WAY OR

02:54:57.354 --> 02:55:00.423 region:rollup2
JUST BECAUSE YOU KNOW THEY DON'T

02:54:58.722 --> 02:55:01.124 region:rollup2
LIKE IT EVERY CITY CAN DO THAT

02:55:00.423 --> 02:55:02.859 region:rollup2
NOW.

02:55:01.124 --> 02:55:04.127 region:rollup2
AND I'M JUST CURIOUS TO WHY WE

02:55:02.859 --> 02:55:05.962 region:rollup2
WOULDN'T LEAVE THAT TO THE LOCAL

02:55:04.127 --> 02:55:07.263 region:rollup2

02:55:07.263 --> 02:55:09.599 region:rollup2
THAT.

02:55:07.697 --> 02:55:11.401 region:rollup2
THERE CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS ARE

02:55:09.599 --> 02:55:13.136 region:rollup2
SO CLOSE TO THEIR CONSTITUENTS

02:55:11.401 --> 02:55:13.770 region:rollup2
RATE BECAUSE THEY HAVE THEIR

02:55:13.136 --> 02:55:15.372 region:rollup2

02:55:13.770 --> 02:55:17.140 region:rollup2

02:55:17.140 --> 02:55:22.012 region:rollup2

02:55:19.542 --> 02:55:22.579 region:rollup2
MORE SO THAN US REPRESENTING

02:55:22.012 --> 02:55:23.813 region:rollup2
FORTY FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE

02:55:22.579 --> 02:55:25.014 region:rollup2
WHERE THEY CAN REALLY SAY THEY

02:55:23.813 --> 02:55:26.816 region:rollup2
WERE I THINK THEY WOULD GET A

02:55:25.014 --> 02:55:28.551 region:rollup2
GOOD IDEA OF GOSH THE COMMUNITY

JURISDICTION OVER STATE

02:56:07.957 --> 02:56:13.396 region:rollup2

CONTRACT.

02:57:00.076 --> 02:57:02.912 region:rollup2
FACT I I WORRY THAT OUR

02:57:01.711 --> 02:57:03.947 region:rollup2
COLLEAGUE HAS BLOWN THE WHISTLE

02:57:02.912 --> 02:57:06.449 region:rollup2
ON THE DESK WHO TOOK IT MIGHT'VE

WITHOUT PERMITS ON A STATE

02:57:06.983 --> 02:57:09.586 region:rollup2
FACILITY.

02:57:08.084 --> 02:57:11.654 region:rollup2
OR THEY TURNED OFF OPERATE

02:57:09.586 --> 02:57:13.256 region:rollup2
ADJACENT TO A STATE FACILITY

02:57:11.654 --> 02:57:14.724 region:rollup2
WHICH WOULD THEN BE LEGAL

02:57:13.256 --> 02:57:16.759 region:rollup2
DEPENDING ON THE JURISDICTION.

02:57:14.724 --> 02:57:17.827 region:rollup2
SO CITY IS NOT INTERFERE WITH

02:57:16.759 --> 02:57:19.395 region:rollup2
THE STATE PROPERTY STATES

02:57:17.827 --> 02:57:21.197 region:rollup2
KNOCKING INTERFERE WITH THE CITY

02:57:19.395 --> 02:57:22.899 region:rollup2

THE LOCALS THIS IS UP TO US

02:57:22.899 --> 02:57:27.470 region:rollup2
CENTER. FOR A STATE AGENCY TO

02:57:24.868 --> 02:57:29.739 region:rollup2
TAKE ON THIS ROLE ENSURE THAT

02:57:27.470 --> 02:57:30.373 region:rollup2
THERE ARE CERTAIN MATERIALS THAT

02:57:29.739 --> 02:57:32.842 region:rollup2
ARE APPROPRIATE AND NOT

02:57:30.373 --> 02:57:33.977 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE GIVEN THAT POTENTIAL

02:57:32.842 --> 02:57:34.777 region:rollup2
FOR HARM IN THE AMOUNT OF WASTE

02:57:33.977 --> 02:57:36.479 region:rollup2
THAT WE SEE.

02:57:34.777 --> 02:57:37.947 region:rollup2
IS GOOD MODELING ESPECIALLY FOR

02:57:36.479 --> 02:57:40.183 region:rollup2
PEOPLE ARE NOW COMING TO STATE

02:57:37.947 --> 02:57:42.185 region:rollup2
FACILITIES A COMING STATE PARKS.

02:57:40.183 --> 02:57:44.087 region:rollup2
AND A LOT OF LEASES THE PARKS A

02:57:42.185 --> 02:57:45.388 region:rollup2
MARRIED TO SPEND A TREMENDOUS

02:57:44.087 --> 02:57:47.123 region:rollup2
AMOUNT OF TIME AND ENERGY.

02:57:45.388 --> 02:57:48.024 region:rollup2
ON ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION

02:57:47.123 --> 02:57:49.492 region:rollup2
WHAT'S APPROPRIATE WHAT'S NOT

02:57:48.024 --> 02:57:50.860 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE TRYING TO GET A LOT

02:57:49.492 --> 02:57:51.761 region:rollup2
OF THESE MATERIALS OFF THE

02:57:50.860 --> 02:57:52.362 region:rollup2
BEACHES.

02:57:51.761 --> 02:57:57.767 region:rollup2
AND THE AMOUNT OF OF TIME AND

02:57:52.362 --> 02:57:59.035 region:rollup2
AND SPENT ON CLEAN UPS.

02:57:57.767 --> 02:58:00.436 region:rollup2
FOR THE EXACT KIND MATERIALS

02:57:59.035 --> 02:58:02.805 region:rollup2
THAT WERE TALKING ABOUT HERE

02:58:00.436 --> 02:58:04.107 region:rollup2
REALLY CAN BE EXTRAORDINARY SO

02:58:02.805 --> 02:58:05.175 region:rollup2
FOR THE STATE'S TAKE SOME LEAVE

02:58:04.107 --> 02:58:06.543 region:rollup2
FOR THE STATE TO SAY THESE ARE

02:58:05.175 --> 02:58:08.344 region:rollup2
MATERIALS THAT ARE APPROPRIATE.

02:58:06.543 --> 02:58:09.979 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT'S THAT'S GREAT FOR

02:58:08.344 --> 02:58:12.015 region:rollup2
US TO BE ABLE TO DO AND WOULD

02:58:09.979 --> 02:58:13.816 region:rollup2
NOT AT ALL INFRINGE ON A LOCAL

02:58:12.015 --> 02:58:15.285 region:rollup2
JURISDICTION OR THEIR ABILITY TO

02:58:13.816 --> 02:58:16.185 region:rollup2
DO WHATEVER THEY CAP THAT I

02:58:15.285 --> 02:58:16.686 region:rollup2
WOULD HOPE THAT A LOCAL

02:58:16.185 --> 02:58:17.787 region:rollup2
JURISDICTIONS SEEING THE

02:58:16.686 --> 02:58:19.956 region:rollup2
SUCCESS.

02:58:17.787 --> 02:58:22.258 region:rollup2
ADDED ADJACENT STATE PARK WOULD

02:58:19.956 --> 02:58:25.028 region:rollup2
ALSO STEP UP AND DO THESE KINDS

02:58:22.258 --> 02:58:25.695 region:rollup2
OF BANDS WE WE'VE DONE THIS IN

02:58:25.028 --> 02:58:28.364 region:rollup2
SANTA CRUZ COUNTY.

02:58:25.695 --> 02:58:30.433 region:rollup2
FAIRLY MUCH ACROSS THE BOARD AND

02:58:28.364 --> 02:58:32.569 region:rollup2
THE AMOUNT OF LITTER AND OTHER

02:58:30.433 --> 02:58:34.971 region:rollup2
MATERIALS THAT WE SEE PLASTICS

02:58:32.569 --> 02:58:37.006 region:rollup2
SARAH OVER THINGS IN IN THE

02:58:34.971 --> 02:58:38.908 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENT HAS DECREASED

02:58:37.006 --> 02:58:40.210 region:rollup2
DRAMATICALLY SO THESE KINDS

02:58:38.908 --> 02:58:41.144 region:rollup2
ORDINANCES WORK.

02:58:40.210 --> 02:58:42.679 region:rollup2
THAT THERE ARE PLENTY OF

02:58:41.144 --> 02:58:44.280 region:rollup2

WILL BE SUCCESSFUL.

02:58:57.527 --> 02:58:59.762 region:rollup2
WE CAN GET THIS TO THE

02:58:58.328 --> 02:59:01.497 region:rollup2

I JUST LIKE TO SAY THE COUPLE OF

03:09:14.009 --> 03:09:16.478 region:rollup2
QUICK POINTS THAT THERE ARE

03:09:15.044 --> 03:09:17.446 region:rollup2
CONTRACTORS ARE DOING THIS KIND

03:09:16.478 --> 03:09:18.814 region:rollup2
OF WORK AND WORKING TOWARDS

03:09:17.446 --> 03:09:20.382 region:rollup2
PROVIDING A LOW EMISSIONS.

03:09:18.814 --> 03:09:21.817 region:rollup2
ECONOMY THE NUMBERS ARE SMALL

03:09:20.382 --> 03:09:23.719 region:rollup2
THE NASCENT INDUSTRY AND IT

03:09:21.817 --> 03:09:24.987 region:rollup2
NEEDS TO BE SUPPORTED. ONE OF

03:09:23.719 --> 03:09:26.655 region:rollup2
THE BARRIERS WE FACE IS LACK OF

03:09:24.987 --> 03:09:28.090 region:rollup2
AWARENESS BY BOTH CONTRACTORS

03:09:26.655 --> 03:09:29.358 region:rollup2
AND HOMEOWNERS THAT THERE IS AN

03:09:28.090 --> 03:09:30.860 region:rollup2
ABILITY TO DO THIS.

03:09:29.358 --> 03:09:32.595 region:rollup2
THE TECHNOLOGY IS HERE IT'S IT'S

03:09:30.860 --> 03:09:33.229 region:rollup2
A PROVEN TECHNOLOGY THAT A LOT

03:09:32.595 --> 03:09:34.163 region:rollup2
OF DIFFERENT OPTIONS IN THE WAY

03:09:33.229 --> 03:09:35.965 region:rollup2
TO DO IT --

03:09:34.163 --> 03:09:36.565 region:rollup2
THAT SAID THE PRODUCTS ARE NOT

03:09:35.965 --> 03:09:37.933 region:rollup2
ALWAYS AVAILABLE DUE TO DEMAND

03:09:36.565 --> 03:09:39.201 region:rollup2
--

03:09:37.933 --> 03:09:40.135 region:rollup2
WE'RE HOPEFUL THAT INCENTIVES

03:09:39.201 --> 03:09:41.670 region:rollup2
ARE FOSTER GROWTH IN THE

03:09:40.135 --> 03:09:43.706 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY SOMEBODY WAY THAT THE

03:09:41.670 --> 03:09:45.374 region:rollup2
CSI PROGRAM WORK WITH SOLAR --

03:09:43.706 --> 03:09:46.642 region:rollup2
WE SAW THAT PROP UP INDUSTRY

03:09:45.374 --> 03:09:48.077 region:rollup2
WHEN IT WAS STARTING OUT AS A

03:09:46.642 --> 03:09:49.111 region:rollup2
YOUNG INDUSTRY AND MATURE.

03:09:48.077 --> 03:09:50.579 region:rollup2
INTO COMPLETE MARKET

03:09:49.111 --> 03:09:51.947 region:rollup2
TRANSFORMATION WE BELIEVE THE

03:09:50.579 --> 03:09:53.382 region:rollup2
SAME THING CAN HAPPEN HERE --

03:09:51.947 --> 03:09:55.084 region:rollup2
WE SEE THAT INCENTIVE LOWER

03:09:53.382 --> 03:09:57.686 region:rollup2
COSTS AND INCREASED CONTRACTOR

03:09:55.084 --> 03:09:58.754 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATION AND ARE A VERIFIER

03:09:57.686 --> 03:10:00.889 region:rollup2
TO HOMEOWNERS IT'S A LEGITIMATE

03:09:58.754 --> 03:10:02.324 region:rollup2
CAUSE -- WE

03:10:00.889 --> 03:10:04.293 region:rollup2
THINK THAT WE HAVE THE SITUATION

03:10:02.324 --> 03:10:06.061 region:rollup2
THAT HERE WE CAN INCREASE --

03:10:04.293 --> 03:10:07.196 region:rollup2
THE THE MANUFACTURES WE SAW IT

03:10:06.061 --> 03:10:08.364 region:rollup2
WE HAVE A PROBLEM OF SUPPLY AND

03:10:07.196 --> 03:10:09.932 region:rollup2
DEMAND OF SOME OF THE THE

03:10:08.364 --> 03:10:11.100 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGIES AVAILABLE.

03:10:09.932 --> 03:10:11.700 region:rollup2
MANUFACTURES HAD THE BILLY

03:10:11.100 --> 03:10:12.935 region:rollup2
PROVIDE THEM BUT THERE ISN'T

03:10:11.700 --> 03:10:14.436 region:rollup2
ENOUGH DEMAND AND WE'VE BEEN

03:10:12.935 --> 03:10:17.273 region:rollup2
TOLD REPEATEDLY THAT.

03:10:14.436 --> 03:10:17.806 region:rollup2
IF YOU CAN SHOW ENOUGH INTEREST

03:10:17.273 --> 03:10:20.109 region:rollup2
STATE WE WILL PROVIDE THE

03:10:17.806 --> 03:10:22.278 region:rollup2
PRODUCTS AND SEWER BEEN COURAGE

03:10:20.109 --> 03:10:23.279 region:rollup2
IN THAT THAT WILL BE A CASE.

03:10:22.278 --> 03:10:24.747 region:rollup2
HOW WE ALSO SEE THIS IS BILLY TO

03:10:23.279 --> 03:10:26.181 region:rollup2
TRAIN CONTRACTORS AND GET THEM

03:10:24.747 --> 03:10:27.616 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATE AND FINALLY WOULD

03:10:26.181 --> 03:10:29.151 region:rollup2
LIKE TO SAY THAT THIS?

03:10:27.616 --> 03:10:30.953 region:rollup2
SERVES TO BENEFIT THOSE WHO NEED

03:10:29.151 --> 03:10:31.987 region:rollup2
IT MOST AS IT DOES ADDRESS LOW

03:10:30.953 --> 03:10:33.923 region:rollup2
INCOME AND DISADVANTAGED

03:10:31.987 --> 03:10:34.423 region:rollup2
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES.

03:10:33.923 --> 03:10:35.157 region:rollup2
WHICH WE THINK IS REALLY

03:10:34.423 --> 03:10:36.258 region:rollup2
CRITICAL.

NATURAL GAS UTILITIES THAT

03:16:09.324 --> 03:16:14.096 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATE IN THAT PART IT'S A

03:16:11.860 --> 03:16:14.663 region:rollup2
SORT OF A SUBSECTION OF THE CAP

03:16:14.096 --> 03:16:17.933 region:rollup2
AND TRADE PROGRAM THAT WE'RE

03:16:14.663 --> 03:16:18.900 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT SO IT'S A IT'S A IT'S

03:16:17.933 --> 03:16:20.502 region:rollup2
ONLY THE UTILITY.

03:16:18.900 --> 03:16:22.204 region:rollup2
CHUNK OF THE ALLOWANCE --

03:16:20.502 --> 03:16:23.272 region:rollup2
MARKET.

03:16:22.204 --> 03:16:25.007 region:rollup2
AND IT'S LOOKING AT BOTH THE

03:16:23.272 --> 03:16:27.643 region:rollup2
NATURAL GAS SIDE IN THE ELECTRIC

03:16:25.007 --> 03:16:29.044 region:rollup2
SIDE CURRENTLY I THINK 15% OF

03:16:27.643 --> 03:16:31.480 region:rollup2
THE ELECTRIC SIDE.

03:16:29.044 --> 03:16:33.315 region:rollup2
OF FUNDS THAT ARE COLLECTED GO

03:16:31.480 --> 03:16:34.950 region:rollup2

RIGHT BUT BUT CURRENTLY THE

03:16:36.151 --> 03:16:38.920 region:rollup2
NATURAL GAS DOLLARS ARE SORT OF

03:16:37.486 --> 03:16:40.722 region:rollup2
JUST.

03:16:38.920 --> 03:16:42.224 region:rollup2
SITTING THERE AND THAT IF WE

03:16:42.224 --> 03:16:45.427 region:rollup2
THEY'LL GO BACK AS A STRAIGHT

03:16:44.159 --> 03:16:47.029 region:rollup2
DIVIDEND I THINK THAT'S THE

03:16:45.427 --> 03:16:48.497 region:rollup2
ANTICIPATED FOCUS WE'RE

03:16:47.029 --> 03:16:49.364 region:rollup2
INTERESTED IN CARVING OUT A

03:16:48.497 --> 03:16:51.133 region:rollup2
SMALL PIECE OF THAT.

03:16:49.364 --> 03:16:52.534 region:rollup2

BECAUSE I DON'T.

03:17:03.378 --> 03:17:07.115 region:rollup2
THE INTENTION HERE IS NOT TO GO

03:17:04.680 --> 03:17:08.817 region:rollup2
