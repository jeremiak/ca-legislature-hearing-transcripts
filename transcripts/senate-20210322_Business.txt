CIRCULAR YOU HAVE ONE BILL TO PRESENT TODAY SB THREE OR FOUR. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN ROTH AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS GOOD MORNING. I'M HERE TO PRESENT SENATE BILL THREE ALL FOUR HANDY PERSON EXEMPTION UPDATE. SENATE BILL THREE OH FOR UPDATES THE VALUE OF MINOR WORK CONSTRUCTION CONTRACT NOT SUBJECT TO REGULATION BY THE CONTRACTORS STATE LICENSING BOARD FROM FIVE HUNDRED TO ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS. THE CONTRACTORS LICENSING BOARD THE WASHINGTON REGULATES CONTRACTORS AND HOME IMPROVEMENT SALES PERSON. UNDER CONTRACTORS STATE LICENSING LAW. CONTRACTORS UNDER THE CONTRACTORS STATE LICENSE THE LAW MUST MEET SPECIFIED REQUIREMENTS AND MAINTAIN A CONTRACTOR'S LICENSE WHICH CAN SOMETIMES REPRESENT A HURDLE TO WORK. THE CONTRACTORS STATE LICENSING BOARD CURRENTLY ALLOWS HANDY PERSONS TO BE UNLICENSED AND STILL PERFORM CONSTRUCTION WORK AS LONG AS THE COST OF THE WORK IS UNDER FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS. AND IS CONSIDERED OF CASUAL MINOR OR INCONSEQUENTIAL NATURE. THIS EXEMPTION ALLOWS CONSUMERS ACCESS TO UNLICENSED ANY PERSON TO PERFORM MINOR CONSTRUCTION JOBS WHICH SAVES CONSUMERS TIME AND MONEY IT ALSO CREATES. INCREASE JOB ACCESS FOR UNDER LICENSE AND THE PERSONS HOWEVER. THE LAST UPDATE TO THIS EXEMPTION WAS IN NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT. WITH SENATE BILL TWENTY TWO SEVENTEEN- O'CONNELL WHEN THE THRESHOLD WAS RAISED FROM THREE HUNDRED TO FIVE HUNDRED. THE VALUE OF FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS WORTH OF CONSTRUCTION WORK IS NO LONGER WORTH THE SAME AS IT WAS IN NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT. THIS CREATES SEVERE LIMITATIONS FOR UNLICENSED HANDY PERSONS AS PRICE FOR MATERIAL AND LABOR HAVE INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY. IN THE PAST TWENTY THREE YEARS. SENATE BILL THREE OR FOUR WILL INCREASE THE THRESHOLD OF THE EXEMPTION FOR UNLICENSED CONSTRUCTION WORK AS LONG AS THE WORK IS CONSIDERED CASUAL MINOR INCONSEQUENTIAL FROM FIVE HUNDRED TO ONE THOUSAND INCREASING. CONSUMERS SAVE TIME AND MONEY ON SMALL PROJECTS. I HAVE COMMITTED TO WORK WITH STAKEHOLDERS OR AMENDMENTS TO ADDRESS ANY CONCERNS THEY MAY HAVE AND A PLAN TO TAKE AMENDMENTS OUTLINED IN THE ANALYSIS. TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT TODAY I HAVE ANA BOX REPRESENTING THE BILL'S SPONSOR THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS.

HE WROTE IS THEREFORE JUSTIFIED TODAY THAT THE STATUTE BE ADJUSTED AGAIN THE COUNT FOR. BOTH INFLATION AND THE INCREASED COSTS IN CONSTRUCTION MATERIAL. WHICH VERY OFTEN OUTPACES INFLATION. HOLDING CONTRACTORS LICENSE IS A PRIVILEGE NOT REQUIRED BOTH WHERE IT'S CALLED AN INSIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF OVERHEAD. TO MAINTAIN THIS LICENSE. THERE ARE MANY WORKERS.

IN FACT THANK YOU TO ALL OF OUR SUPPORT AND OPPOSITION WITNESSES WHO PROVIDED TESTIMONY TODAY WILL NOW BRING IT BACK TO A DISCUSSION HERE ON THE SENATE FLOOR WITH MY COLLEAGUES COLLEAGUES ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS- SENATOR PAN. BUT I CANNABIS CHAIR- AND- FREESHEET THE PRESENTATION FROM THE BILL AUTHORED BY DID HAVE SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT THE BILL- FIRST OF ALL- I UNDERSTAND UNDER EXISTING LAWS SAID WORK MUST BE CONSIDERED QUOTE CASUAL MINOR OR INCONSEQUENTIAL AND I REALIZE THAT'S EXISTING LAW. BUT CAN YOU CLARIFY THE DEFINITION SO FOR EXAMPLE SAYS RAISING THE THRESHOLD FROM FIVE HUNDRED TO A THOUSAND IS PROPOSED IN THIS. BILL. IF YOU KNOW THOUSAND DOLLARS I MEAN FOR EXAMPLE IS THIS INCLUDE PLUMBING OR ELECTRICAL WORKS- H. FAX SYSTEMS SOME OF THESE CAN BE FAIRLY. TECHNICAL AND- IF THEY'RE NOT DONE RIGHT-% AGAIN SOMEONE. HERE WOULDN'T WOULDN'T HAVE TO HAVE A CONTRACTOR'S LICENSE SO CAN YOU JUST CLARIFY THE DEFINITION OF CASUAL MINOR INCONSEQUENTIAL DOES THAT INCLUDE- WORK THAT WOULD. INVOLVE- THINGS LIKE WITH THE PLUMBING ELECTRICAL AGE BACK THOSE TYPES OF THINGS- THE THINGS WERE THERE'S NOTHING CONSEQUENCES IT'S NOT DONE RIGHT. THE FUTURE BUT I WILL ENSURE FOR A LITTLE BIT THEN I'LL ASK OUR OUR A REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS TO JUMP IN. BUT IT IS IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE POINT THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT- IS ALL WORK WHETHER BE ELECTRICAL PLUMBING HEATING ROOFING- ANYTHING TO DO. WITH CONSTRUCTION IT COULD NOT EXCEED THEONE THOUSAND DOLLAR THRESHOLD- WITHOUT OF A CONTRACTOR'S LICENSE AND BELIEVE ME I AM AN HOTEL YOU TOTALLY SUPPORT OF THE UNIONS THE WORKERS EVERYONE AND I AM IN SUPPORT OF THOSE WHO ARE DOING THE CONSTRUCTION WHETHER IT BE FIRE REPAIRS OR ANY CONSTRUCTION THEY SHOULD ALL BE PROTECTED ALL THE WORKERS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MINOR WORK. THAT THE HOMEOWNER IS ABLE TO PICK UP THE PHONE AND GET THE NEIGHBORHOOD HANDY PERSON TO DO THE WORK AND AGAIN AS A REMINDER THAT THE WORK IN QUESTION IF IT IS VIOLATED- AND IT EXCEEDS THE AMOUNT THERE'S A SIX OUT OF SIX MONTHS. IT'S A MISDEMEANOR WITH THAT WOULD CALL FOR SIX MONTHS IN JAIL A FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR FINE AND- IT IS OVERSEEN BY THE CALIFORNIA STATE LICENSING BOARD- WHO HAS THE JURISDICTION TO DO THAT. BUT- ALL THE WORK WE'RE TALKING TO. NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT. TO TODAY- SO THAT IT'S A NUMBERS GAME HERE IT'S FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS WHICH IS A THOUSAND. SO IF I'M ASKING TO TAKE THIS OUT OF COMMITTEE SO THEY COULD CONTINUE- NEGOTIATING BECAUSE THERE IS ROOM FOR NEGOTIATION THE FIND THAT READ THAT MAGIC NUMBER BETWEEN FIVE HUNDRED. AND ONE THOUSAND IF IT'S SO AGREED UPON AND I THINK THE SPIRIT OF LABOR HAS ALWAYS BEEN TO NEGOTIATE. TO FIND THE RIGHT NUMBER ACROSS THE BOARD AND I THINK THIS IS WHAT I'M TRYING TO DO IS GET IT INTO THE NEXT COMMITTEE SO WE CAN CONTINUE. LOOKING FOR THE AMENDMENT BUT I WOULD LIKE- THE SPONSOR TO JUMP IN THE FALL THERE'S ANY COMMENT TO THE QUESTION. OR MAYBE I MY OTHER QUESTIONS AND WHETHER THE SPONSORS WANT TO ALSO ADDRESS THE AS WELL SIX CRISTINA TARD TO BRING PEOPLE ON THE LINE OR THEY CAN ANSWER RIGHT NOW USE SUCCEED. YEAH OKAY EXCELLENT SO THE PARTS A WIN SO ONE QUESTION WAS ABOUT THE TYPE OF WORK AND APPRECIATE YOUR ANSWER AND WE'LL HEAR FROM THE SPONSORS AS WELL. THE SECOND QUESTION IS ACTUALLY RELATED TO YEAH IF YOU'RE NOT IF YOU DON'T HAVE A LICENSE- THE LICENSE REQUIRES YOU TO BE FUNDED REQUIRES THE OF WORKERS COMPENSATION SO. IS SO HAS TO DO AGAIN- WITH THE RISK. TO THE HOMEOWNER WHO ARE THE PERSON WHO INVOLVES THIS UNLICENSED CONTRACTOR WHETHER- AND I REALIZE THAT THEY'RE STILL AT RISK. UNDER FIVE HUNDRED BUT- IN TERMS OF THE HANDYMAN GETS INJURED ON THE JOB WHAT'S THE LIABILITIES AND TO THE PERSON ENGAGING THEM. ESPECIALLY NOW THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT POTENTIALLY MORE SUBSTANTIAL WORK AND THEN FINALLY. I GUESS THE OTHER QUESTION IS THAT- USED.TO TALK AND A PREVIOUS CENTER ACTUALLY TALK ABOUT NEGOTIATION BUT WHY A THOUSAND- THE INFLATION WOULD HAVE CAPS WOULD HAVE PUT IT LOOKS LIKE ACCORDING TO THE ANALYSIS AROUND EIGHT HUNDRED SO. THE REASON FOR ACTUALLY. THIS IS YOU MENTIONED SHE ASIAN WHAT WHY DOUBLE ITS SYDNEY A MORE. WITH WHAT THE INCREASE WOULD HAVE BEEN. FOR SO THE QUESTIONS IF YOU WISH TO. AB SPONSORS ANSWER THEM- OR S. U. S. ANY FURTHER ANYTHING FURTHER- SERDULA FEEDING AND THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ANSWERING THOSE QUESTIONS. THANK YOU I THINK YOUR YOUR YOUR POINT. IS WELL TAKEN IF THE INFLATION RATE IS APPROXIMATELY HUNDRED FIFTY TWO DOLLARS AND- EIGHTY SEVEN CENTS WHY ISN'T THAT THE NUMBER. OF LET THE- SPONSOR ENSURE THAT- BUT GOING BACK TO THE PROTECTION OF THE WORKER. OBVIOUSLY THE JOBS THAT ARE DONE ARE DONE BY. HOMEOWNERS WHICH HAVE HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE. WHICH DOES PROTECT. THE HOMEOWNER AND THE WORKER GOD FORBID IF SOMETHING WERE TO HAPPEN ON THE PROPERTY. SO THAT IS HOW THE PROTECTION IS THERE DOESN'T ELIMINATE THAT. PROTECTION IT JUST ALL WE'RE LOOKING FOR. IS THE FINDING THE RIGHT NUMBER SHOW UP. IN A BOOK WOULD YOU PLEASE- JUMP IN. YES GOOD MORNING- STARTING OFF WITH REGARD TO WHY THE ONE THOUSAND DOLLAR NUMBER WELL THAT'S SIMPLE THE COST OF LIVING AND DOING BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA HAS CONTINUED TO RISE EACH YEAR AND THAT FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS NOT THAT SAME FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS IN ADDITION WE HAVE SEEN HUGE INCREASES IN CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS. THAT ARE FAR OUTPACING THE CARBON INFLATION FOR EXAMPLE DR AUTHORED BY THE REASON YOU'RE COULD BE 30% ANNUAL INCREASES AND PACKING A WALLOP NOTHING I HAD THE PERSON WOULD VERY WELL BE INTERESTED IN DOING SO WELL AND GRAYSON STAYS AROUND 2% A YEAR WE'D BE TALKING MATERIALS GOING WAY WAY THAT AS WELL AS THE COST OF LABOR I'M- ALSO WITH REGARD TO THE DEFINITION OF WHAT WOULD BE CONSIDERED HANDYMAN WORK THAT LANGUAGE- CASUAL MINOR OR INCONSEQUENTIAL NATURE. EXISTS IN FACT YOU AND THERE IS ACTUALLY THERE'S NOT A DEFINITION OF- WHAT IT WOULD BE CONSIDERED CASUAL MINOR INCONSEQUENTIAL WE'D BE OPEN TO WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION ON HI AND REFINING THAT DEFINITION SO WE CAN FIND THE RIGHT BALANCE HERE- MOVED BACK THIS BILL. FORWARD THANK YOU. THANK YOU. SEVERAL OF SO ACTUALLY THERE STOP THIS BRIEF- THAT CITY. I HAVE TO AT THAT- ICE HAVE A IT INTERNAL ADDRESS CONCERN I SUING. YOUR DESIRE TO WERE WITH THE OP. BUT I THINK IT POINT TIME- NOT SURE I'M REAL THERE THE- FOR ON THE BILL BUT YOU THANK YOU SO PENSION. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. I APPRECIATE HEARING THE AUTHOR SAID THAT HE'D BE WILLING TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION I'M GONNA LAY OFF TODAY IF THE BILL GETS- TO THE NEXT COMMITTEE. I HOPE THAT SOME OF THOSE THINGS WILL GET WORKED OUT- I THINK THAT THE ISSUE I HAVE IS IT KIND OF PUTS A CRACK. IN THE FOUNDATION NO PUN INTENDED- AND THEN THERE ARE SOME KIND OF CONCERNED ABOUT THAT SO THANK YOU THANK YOU SO LABOR. CENTER. MELINDA'S PAUL BY SEVEN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN- SO IF I HAVE A OF THE BILL AUTHORED I MAY- IS THERE ANY LEGAL RECOURSE FOR SOMEONE GIVEN THE SITUATION IF THERE'S- YOU KNOW THE WORK ISN'T DONE PROPERLY THE CONSUMERS NOT SATISFIED SHOULD THIS BILL PASS WOULD CONSUMERS STILL HAVE SOME SORT OF LEGAL RECOURSE TO RECOUP THOSE COSTS OR HAVE THE PERSON FIX THE PROBLEM YES AND- SENATOR DO WHAT THE WAY IT WORKS OBVIOUSLY AGAIN LET ME STATE THIS AT THE INFRACTION. IS THERE AN AND THE BEEN IT'S DISCOVERED THAT THE INDIVIDUAL CHARGE TOO MUCH- AGAIN IT'S A MISDEMEANOR SIX MONTHS IN JAIL FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR FINE IN ITS OVERSEEN BY THE STATE CONTRACTORS LICENSING OARD AND BECAUSE WE'RE WE'RE LOOKING AT A NUMBER THAT IS BENEATH AT A THOUSAND DOLLARS THE- THE RESTITUTION OR OR THE MONEY IS RETURNED WILL COME FROM SMALL CLAIMS COURT. BETWEEN THE HOMEOWNER AND THAT AND THE PERSON SO- THE HOMEOWNER IS PROTECTED BY LAW USING THE COURT SYSTEM BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT IT IT'S UNDER A THOUSAND DOLLARS HE IN- EVERYONE'S BEEN PROTECTED AND THAT'S THE POINT THE CONSUMER WHO HAS THE OPTION AND IN AGAIN WITH ALL THE CONSTRUCTION THAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IN THE FUTURE. AND YES WE NEED TO PROTECT OUR OUR CONTRACTORS IN THE AND THE UNION WORKERS AND WE'RE GOING TO DO THAT AND AGAIN THIS IS JUST THAT SMALL ELEMENT IN IN AGAIN REMEMBER THIS IS MATERIAL AND LABOR SO IF YOU HAVE MATERIAL THAT'S A- EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS AND THEIR CHARGE FOR THE WORK IS GOING TO BE THREE OR FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS THAT EXCEEDS IT SO A CONTRACTOR MUST BE OBTAINED IN THAT'S THE ISSUE IT'S JUST THE COST AND IT'S GOT TO BE AN ADJUSTMENT. AND AS WE pHEARD- FROM THE SPONSOR. THAT THEY'RE READY TO SIT DOWN AND CAN CAN YOU TRYING TO FOR THAT MATCH NUMBER IN THE WHY WE'RE JUST TRYING. GET IT TO THE NEXT. I THANK YOU FOR THE ANSWER THAT CLEARS THINGS UP I THINK ON MY END AND I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT- THIS. THE AGGREGATE AGGREGATE CONTACT. CONTRACT PRICE HASN'T INCREASED IN TWENTY THREE YEARS A NUMBER OF CST- HAVE INCREASED IN CALIFORNIA OVER THE LAST TWENTY THREE YEARS IN THE LEGISLATURE HAS SEEN FIT. TO MAKE SURE THAT- PAYMENT MATCHES THE RISING COSTS FOR INSTANCE THE MINIMUM WAGE- WE CONTINUE TO RAISE THE MINIMUM WAGE BECAUSE THE COST OF LIVING IN CALIFORNIA HAS INCREASED OVER TIME. AND I'M NOT SURE THAT THERE'S- A BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. THE RISE IN THE COST OF MATERIALS THE RISE IN THE COST OF LABOR. MEAN FOR I'M JUST THINKING BACK TO WHEN. AROUND FENCE BLEW OVER IN OUR YARD. AND THE COST HAD SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASED FOR THE MATERIALS TO REPLACE THAT. NOT BECAUSE OF THE PERSON CHOOSING TO DO THE WORK JUST BECAUSE OF THE MARKETPLACE SO IT INCREASES. THE COST AND THAT THAT'S NOT YOU KNOW ANYBODY'S FAULT IT'S THOSE ARE JUST THE FACTS. SO THE COST HAVE INCREASED IN. TWENTY THREE YEAR TIMES I JUST WOULD CHALLENGE THE LEGISLATURE TO FIND. SOMETHING THAT IS WITHIN THEIR POWER TO INCREASED. THE- IN. THE COST FOR SOMEONE TO RETURN TO RECOUP THAT THEY HAVEN'T YOU KNOW INCREASED IT IN OTHER WORDS WE TAKE THESE OPPORTUNITIES ALL THE TIME TO MAKE SURE THAT. IT'S COSTING REVENUE ARE OUR- MATCH SO I FULLY SUPPORT THIS BILL I DON'T THINK THAT RAISING IT TO A THOUSAND DOLLARS IS. INAPPROPRIATE IN THE LEAST BIT FRANKLY I SHOULD PROBABLY- BE HIGHER BUT I THINK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD TODAY AND I THINK YOU FOR. STANDING UP FOR ALL THE PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO ARE TRYING TO DO THESE JOBS IN BELIEVE ME THERE'S PLENTY OF ROOM FOR LICENSE CONTRACTORS IN THE STATE TO DO ALL THE WORK THAT THEY'VE BEEN DOING AND THEN SOME. NOBODY'S GETTING EDGED OUT THERE'S PLENTY OF ROOM FOR EVERYBODY TO OPERATE IN THIS SPACE SAID THANK YOU. AND I MIGHT ADD SENATOR FROM A- THE- THAT. THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS HAS ALWAYS SAID TO EVERYONE ALWAYS TRY TO GET THREE BIDS WHETHER IT'S A TERMITE WORK WHETHER ITS TITLE COMPANIES LOANS- THE THREE THE MAGIC THREE A BOOK GETTING BIDS TO HOMEOWNERS AND YOU CAN IMAGINE THE SCENARIO. WHERE THE REALTOR TELLSTHE POTENTIAL HOME SELLERS THAT YOU NEED TO DO THIS THIS AND THIS AND- THE BEST THING TO DO IS GET SOME BIDS AND OF COURSE IN SOME CASES THEY WILL START WITH THE HANDY PERSON BUT THEN WHEN THEY REALIZE THAT IT'S GOT TO GET UP INTO FAR EXCEEDING THE THOUSAND DOLLARS. THEN IT HAS TO BE THE LICENSE CONTRACTOR AND THIS IS WHERE THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY IS PROTECTED THIS IS WHERE THE CONSTRUCTION WORKERS PROTECTED BECAUSE THEN YES INDEED THAT WOULD BE SOMEONE WITH THE LICENSE AND AGAIN AS I SAID EARLIER THIS IS PLUMBING HEATING ELECTRICAL ROOFING- AIR CONDITIONING TERMITE WORK YOU NAME IT- IF IT EXCEEDS THAT NUMBER IT'S GOT TO BE A LICENSED CONTRACTOR. THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION THANK YOU OF CENTER MELINDA'S OF CINNAMON. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- I SHARE SOME OF THE CONCERNS OF MY COLLEAGUES SENATOR- I APPRECIATE THE- PURPOSE OF YOUR BILL BUT- I DO HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT- LESS THAN QUALIFIED FOLKS WORKING ON ON THINGS AND I HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT CONTRACTOR CONTRACTOR FRAUD- IN A REPORT THAT YOU I THINK YOU SAW THIS YEAR'S STILL BEING NOTED THAT. THE HIGHEST PERCENTAGE OF COMPLAINTS RECEIVED FROM CONSUMERS FOR IN THE SPACE OF FIVE HUNDRED FIVE THOUSAND. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE DATA I THINK I'M GONNA ECHO CENTER LAVERS STANCE I I'D THEM YOU KNOW I KNOW YOU'RE AN HONORABLE PERSON- I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING HOW YOUR AMENDMENTS PROCEED- SO I'M GONNA STAND TODAY AND SEE WHAT THE FINAL PRODUCT LOOKS LIKE. I THINK IT'S AN CINNAMON THANK YOU CENTER. THANK YOU MISTER SO TO ECHO SENTIMENTS COMMENTS AND CENTER LATEST. BUT ALSO TO GENERAL AND HIS POINT THAT YOU KNOW AS TO THE RECOURSE FOR THE CONSUMER. AND SMALL CLAIMS COURT THINK AS WE ALL KNOW IT'S NOT A PARTICULAR EFFECTIVE VENUE FOR RECOUPING. THE COST PARTICULARLY AROUND THIS CLASS OF CONTRACTORS THAT YOU DAY- JERRY DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES THEY ARE HARD TO FIND. I'M NOT SURE THAT'S A GOOD REMEDY- AND TO MY MIND THE BIG ISSUE ON% THIS BILL IS AROUND THE RATHER AMBIGUOUS DESCRIPTION OF THE WORK A CASUAL MINOR. OR INCIDENTAL- I THINK CENTER MELINDA'S POINT ABOUT THE FENCE. IS WELL TAKEN- SO MY QUESTION TO OTHERS HAS SOME THOUGHT BEEN GIVEN.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR WELL I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUES I THINK GIVEN THE COST- THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX OVER THE YEARS I THINK YOU'VE GOT SOME THINGS YOU NEED TO WORK OUT IN TERMS OF THAT. I DO RESPECTFULLY SAY THAT I THINK IT'S MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING THE REALITY IS I'VE HAD BILLS IN THIS HOUSE I TRIED TO THWART THE UNDERGROUND ECONOMY WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO BECAUSE I THINK IT'S INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT BUT THIS ISN'T REALLY. WHERE WE NEED TO- HEY YO TO BE DOING THAT BECAUSE AT A THOUSAND DOLLARS WE ARE REALLY NOT CREATING A HUGE UNDERGROUND ECONOMY LET ME GIVE YOU A POINT I JUST SOLD MY HOME TOOK TO BE QUITE A WHILE TO DO IT DURING. DURING COVERT. BUT IT WAS RELEASED THAT MY REAL OR DID. IT IF. IF YOU HAD TO WAIT FOR A PLUMBER TO COME IN TO REPLACE.

THE WITH THE LATEST ON THE CLOSE EVEN MORE TO REPLACE FIXTURES ALL OVER THE ELECTRICAL OUTLETS JUST. THE- WANTING TO DRESS IT UP A LITTLE BIT THEY DON'T LIKE THE HARVEST GOLD OR WHATEVER THAT. THE COLOR IS A NAY THE- WHOEVER COMES IN TO TRY TO HELP YOU SELL YOUR HOME SAYS IT NEEDS TO BE ALL WHITE. TO HIRE A CONTRACTOR IN THE THESE PEOPLE PERFORM A SERVICE THIS IS SOMETHING THAT- I THINK WE REALLY SHOULD BE DONE I'D LIKE YOU TO WORK ON A HOT THAT DEFINITION. I'D ALSO LIKE YOU TO- WORK ON THE ABOUT THAT I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL. THANK YOU IT WOULD BY THE WAY IT WAS THE AVOCADO THAT GOT ME. THE AVOCADO. CENTER BAKER. THANKS I JUST WANTED TO KNOW TO APPRECIATE DIFFERENCE MY CALLING FROM LOS ANGELES COUNTY AND- I'VE HEARD FOR SOME REALTORS- IT FROM MY DISTRICT IN SUPPORT BUT AS I DID DISCUSS WITH HIM AYE AYE AND CONCERN ABOUT SOME OF THE BROADER IMPACTS THE BILL I'VE HAD SOME PERSONAL EXPERIENCE WITH UNLICENSED CONTRACTORS AND- ALSO SYMPATHETIC TO THE CONCERNS RAISED BY THE TRAINS UNDER ABOUT THE UNDERGROUND- KANEMI SO I I'M GONNA LAY OFF THIS BILL BUT I'M OPEN TO CONTINUE DISCUSSIONS WITH- THE AUTHOR GOING FORWARD. KELLY'S ANY OTHER SENATOR TULLOW. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I JUST WANT TO ECHO THE COMMENTS THAT MIGHT GO TO COLLEAGUE FROM THE NAPA- AT THE NAPA STATED EARLIER I. THE COST OF LIVING THE COST OF MATERIALS HAS JUST GONE WAY WAY TOO HIGH- WE OBVIOUSLY WORD FOR WORD A TIME WHERE WE ARE IN NEED OF HOUSING- IN NEED OF REPAIRS- AND QUITE FRANKLY IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY WE HAVE A LOT OF UNDOCUMENTED PEOPLE WHO. DUNE SYSTEM THIS THIS AREA OF WORK THAT ARE PART OF THE UNDERGROUND ECONOMY I DON'T THINK THEY WANT TO BE PART OF THE UNDERGROUND ECONOMY BUT I GUESS THE QUESTION IS HOW DO WE GET THEM TO NOT BE PART OF THE UNDERGROUND ECONOMY. AND I WILL BE SUPPORTING. THIS THIS BILL TODAY AND I'M HOPING THAT THE AUTHOR CAN CONTINUE TO WORK WITH AT OPPOSITION TO ADDRESS THEIR YOU KNOW ANY ANY CONCERNS AND ISSUES THAT THEY HAVE BUT ALSO TO. KIND OF LOOK AT HOW. WE CAN IMPROVE THE JUST I THINK WE NEED TO IMPROVE THE LICENSING OF. THAT THE SEARCH I BELIEVE THAT IT TAKES FOUR YEARS TO GET CONTRACTORS LICENSE AND THAT'S- THAT'S A VERY LONG TIME. THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER TYLER ANY OTHER MIKES COLLEAGUES ANY OTHER COMMENTS QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS. YOU KNOW I WILL- I'LL GIVE YOU MY COMMENT AT THIS POINT YOU KNOW IT. IT CERTAINLY APPEARS THAT THE SMALL WORK PROVISION. FOR HOMEOWNERS HAS BEEN IN PLACE FOR DECADES ACTUALLY WITHOUT ANY SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE AT LEAST THAT I'VE HEARD. ABOUT FROM LABOR FROM OUR CONSUMER ADVOCATES FROM. ANYONE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SINCE THE BUT THE SEVENTIES OR EIGHTIES- TO THE EXTENT THAT THIS- SMALL WORK EXCEPTION- PROVISION. HAS ANY VALUE IN IT APPARENTLY DOES IF THERE'S NO SPIN NO SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE. AS THE ANALYSIS NOTES IT'S A SIMPLE INFLATION ADJUSTMENT. BRINGS THIS THRESHOLD TO AT LEAST EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS IF NOT PERHAPS MORE. SO I GUESS- CENTER IF THIS BILL MOVES OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE AND MOVES FURTHER THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE. I GUESS ONE THING IS THAT ASK YOU TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE INFLATION ADJUSTMENT AND PERHAPS BRING THE NUMBER A LITTLE CLOSER TO WHAT TO A KIND OF MISTS CITY IT SHOULD BE. A GIVEN THE FACT THAT IT HAS NOT BEEN ADJUSTED SINCE AS I RECALL NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT. NUMBER ONE AND NUMBER TWO TO THE EXTENT THAT- YOUR SPONSOR VIEWS THIS AS CENTRAL TO REAL ESTATE TRANSACTIONS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA PERHAPS YOU WOULD CONSIDER TYING IS A LITTLE CLOSER TO- THE PURCHASE AND SALE OF REAL ESTATE AND REAL ESTATE TRANSACTION ITSELF. I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY. WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSER TO A- YES FOR SURE- THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS- ALL ALL OF MY COLLEAGUES- EDUCATED SEE. THIS IS A HEALTHY DEBATE IT'S BEEN- A GOOD ROUND OF TALKS. AND I REALLY APPRECIATED BUT I WILL TELL YOU AS A REALTOR FOR OVER THIRTY YEARS. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE TELL ALL THE SELLERS IS TO DISCLOSE ANY MATERIAL FACT. OR DEFECT THAT MIGHT BE IN YOUR HOME. AND YOU MUST OBTAIN AN INSPECTION IN TODAY'S WORLD. BUT LISTEN TO THIS BY A LICENSED CONTRACTOR. TO MAKE A DILIGENT INSPECTION OF THE SUBJECT PROPERTY. IN ANY DEFECTS THAT FOUND. WILL BE PRESENTED TO THE POTENTIAL BUYER AND TO YOURSELF. TO OBTAIN- THE WORK BY A LICENSED CONTRACTOR. WHICH INCLUDES PLUMBING HEATING ELECTRICAL ROOFING AND TERMITE WORK. SO THE FOUNDATION IS THERE. TO BRING THE CONTRACTOR INTO THE FOLD OF THE TRANSACTION. AND THE OTHER THING IS THAT WE'VE WE'VE HEARD THE COMMENTS ABOUT THE NUMBER OF THE INFLATION. AND AND I THINK THIS IS THE SPIRIT THAT WE'RE GONNA SEE AS WE MOVE THE BILL FORWARD. AND I THINK THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT CAN'T COME TO FIX- SOMETHING THAT'S MINOR. AND THERE'S PEOPLE THAT ARE NEEDED TO REPLACE THE ENTIRE ROOF OR TO ADD A ROOM. AS YOU KNOW THE INDUSTRY RIGHT NOW IT'S GOING INTO GRANNY FLATS IN THE- GARAGE EXTENSIONS AND SO ON. IN THOSE ARE JOBS THAT ARE NEEDED- BY LICENSED CONTRACTORS IN THE CITY'S A MESS OF THE MISCIBILITY THE WE REPRESENT. THEY'RE GOING TO OVERSEE THAT BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I'M STRONGLY IN FAVOR OF. IS THE MINISTER PALLIPES ON WEEKENDS HAVE INSPECTORS OUT THERE AND FINDING THE PEOPLE THAT ARE ADDING ROOMS AND THINGS TO THE BROOKS TO THEIR HOMES. WITHOUT THAT CONTRACTOR WITHOUT THOSE PERMITS. AND SO I'M TOTALLY IN THE SPIRIT OF DOING THE RIGHT THING AND- ARE YOU WORKERS. BUT THIS IS THIS IS SOMETHING IS JUST AS MINOR ADJUSTMENT THAT'S ALL WE'RE LOOKING FOR AND THAT'S WHY I RESPECTFULLY ASK MOVING ON AND ASK FOR YOUR IDOL.

ESTABLISHING GREATER UNIFORMITY AND TRANSPARENCY AROUND TESTING REQUIREMENTS WILL MAKE CANNABIS AND CANNABIS PRODUCTS SAFER FOR ALL. CURRENTLY THERE'S NO REQUIREMENT FOR STANDARDIZED TESTING OF CANNABIS PRODUCTS. A LACK OF STANDARDISATION MEANS THAT ONE BATCH CAN PRODUCE INCONSISTENT RESULTS BETWEEN AND EVEN WITHIN TESTING FACILITIES.

MISTER CHAIR INSTEAD- I'M HERE BEFORE YOU TO ADD TO ON BEHALF OF S. THREE TWO WHICH WOULD PROHIBIT THE SALES OR OTHER PER SPACE METRICS THAT WOULD COMPROMISE YOUR INTERFERE WITH PROFESSIONAL JUDGE OF LICENSE PHARMACY. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FOR THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS LICENSED PHARMACIST EMPLOYED BY LARGE RETAILERS AND GROCERS ACROSS CALIFORNIA HAVE BEEN SOUNDING ALARMS ABOUT ADVERSE WORKING CONDITIONS WHICH ARE INCREASINGLY UNDERMINING THEIR ABILITY TO PROPERLY CARE FOR THEIR PATIENTS OVER THE PAST DECADE IN RESPONSE TO A CHRONIC SHORTAGE OF PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS CALIFORNIA'S PRIME PHARMACISTS HAVE BEEN ASKED TO GO ABOVE AND BEYOND THEIR ALREADY COMPLEX RESPONSIBILITIES. IN ORDER TO FILL GAPS CURRENTLY PLAGUING OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM OVER THERE INTERVAL THE LEGISLATURE HAS STEADILY EXPANDED THEIR SCOPE OF PRACTICE TO ALLOW FOR ADMINISTERING FLU SHOTS TO PRESCRIBING PREP MEDICATIONS PROVIDING TACKLE TOBACCO CESSATION TWO POOLS DISPENSING CONTRACEPTIVES AND SUPPLYING LIFE SAVING OPIOID OVERDOSE RESCUE PRODUCTS AS A CONSEQUENCE CALIFORNIA'S LICENSED PHARMACISTS ARE TODAY WORKING FASTER FILLING MORE ORDERS AND JUGGLING A WIDER RANGE OF TASKS WITH FEWER STAFF MEMBERS FRANKLY AT A PACE. THAT MANY SAY IS NOT ONLY UNSUSTAINABLE BUT JEOPARDIZES PATIENT SAFETY IN THE TYPICAL COURSE OF FILLING PRESCRIPTIONS A LICENSED PHARMACIST WILL CONTACT THE PRESCRIBING PHYSICIAN TO CONFIRM CORRECT DOSAGE CHECK FOR DRUG INTERACTIONS ALLERGIC RESPONSES COUNCIL AND EDUCATE PATIENTS ABOUT HOW TO PROPERLY ADMINISTER THEIR MEDICINES ANSWER PATIENT QUESTIONS AND ALLAY PATIENT FEARS. ADD TO THAT THE STRAINS AND STRESSES OF THE CURRENT PANDEMIC WITH MOST PHARMACISTS NOW PROVIDING KOPET NINETEEN VACCINATIONS TO DEFEAT THE MOST CHALLENGING PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY FACING CALIFORNIANS IN OVER A CENTURY. WITH CALIFORNIA'S LICENSED PHARMACIST FORCED TO JUGGLE SO MANY IMPORTANT DETAIL ORIENTED RESPONSIBILITIES IT IS INCUMBENT UPON US THIS COMMITTEE AND THE LEGISLATURE AS A WHOLE TO ENSURE THAT THEIR PRIORITY AND FOCUS CAN REMAIN PROVIDING THE HIGHEST POSSIBLE STANDARDS OF PATIENT CARE RECENT INDUSTRY TRENDS TOWARD- TOWARD EVER LEANER STAFFING HAVE HAVE RESULTED. PHARMACY OFTEN FORCED TO LONGER. SOMETIMES FOR AS LONG AS TWELVE AND- WITHOUT A BREAK OR OTHER KIND OF RELIEF MOREOVER AS OWNERSHIP OF RETAIL PHARMACIES AND PBMS HAS CONTINUE TO CONSOLIDATE OVER TIME. PHARMACISTS HAVE ALSO INCREASINGLY FOUND THEMSELVES SUBJECT TO CORPORATE DIRECTIVES GEARED NOT TO THE OPTIMIZATION OF PATIENT CARE. BUT TO THE MAXIMIZATION OF SALES AND PROFITS. AS ONE EXAMPLE. IN THE COURSE OF RECENT REPORTING ON THE INDUSTRY DOCUMENTS OBTAINED BY THE L. A TIMES REVEALED THAT CVS WORKERS ARE EXPECTED TO ENROLL AT LEAST 40% OF PATIENTS INTO THE COMPANY'S AUTOMATIC. PRESCRIPTION RENEWAL PROGRAM. THE PRESSURES INFLICTED BY THE SORTS OF SALES QUOTAS ON ALREADY OVERBURDENED PHARMACIST INCREASES THE LIKELIHOOD OF ERRORS LEADING TO POTENTIALLY DEADLY MISTAKES. EACH YEAR NEARLY ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND CALIFORNIA'S EXPERIENCE HARM AS A CONSEQUENCE OF UNINFORMED OR IMPROPER USE OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. WE NEED TO BRING THIS NUMBER DOWN NOT ALLOW IT TO GO UP FURTHER. PHARMACIST LIKE DOCTORS MUST BE FREE TO PRACTICE MEDICINE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ETHICAL DICTATES OF THEIR PROFESSION. JUST AS WE TAKE AN OATH OF SERVICE IN ASSUMING OUR ROLE SO TO PROFESSIONAL PHARMACISTS AND I LIKE TO READ IT HERE. I PROMISE TO DEVOTE MYSELF TO A LIFETIME OF SERVICE TO OTHERS TO THE PROFESSION OF PHARMACY IN FULFILLING THIS BOW I WILL CONSIDER THE WELFARE OF HUMANITY AND RELIEF OF SUFFERING MY PRIMARY CONCERNS. I WILL APPLY MY KNOWLEDGE EXPERIENCE AND SKILLS TO THE BEST OF MY ABILITY TO ASSURE OPTIMAL OUTCOMES FOR MY PATIENTS I WILL RESPECT AND PROTECT ALL PERSONAL AND HEALTH INFORMATION ENTRUSTED TO ME. I WILL ACCEPT THE LIFELONG OBLIGATION TO IMPROVE MY PROFESSIONAL KNOWLEDGE AND COMPETENCE I WILL HOLD MYSELF AND MY COLLEAGUES TO THE HIGHEST PRINCIPLES OUR PROFESSION'S MORAL ETHICAL AND LEGAL CONDUCT. I WILL EMBRACE AN ADVOCATE CHANGES THAT IMPROVE PATIENT CARE I WILL UTILIZE MY KNOWLEDGE SKILLS EXPERIENCES AND VALUES TO PREPARE THE NEXT GENERATION OF PHARMACISTS I TAKE THESE US VOLUNTARILY. WITH THE FULL REALIZATION OF THEIR SPONSORSHIP SPONSOR ABILITY WITH WHICH I AM ENTRUSTED BY THE PUBLIC. BY PROHIBITING THE APPLICATIONS C. QUOTAS AND OTHER PERFORMANCE METRICS AND RELATE TO QUALITY OF CARE. SB THREE SIXTY WILL ALLOW PHARMACISTS TO MORE FULLY AND DELIBERATE HONOR THAT OATH. TO MEDICAL DECISIONS BASED ON PATIENT NEEDS UNBURDENED BY THE DURESS CREATED BY CORPORATE SALES QUOTAS. OR OTHER PERFORMANCE MEASURES UNRELATED TO QUALITY OF CARE THE PROVISIONS CONTAINED IN THE BILL REPRESENTS A MEANINGFUL STEP TOWARD ENSURING. THAT THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF PATIENTS WILL ONCE AGAIN BE THE TOP PRIORITY FOCUS. FOR CALIFORNIA'S LICENSED PHARMACIST. I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW THAT BEFORE WE GET INTO QUESTIONS THAT I AM COMMITTED TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION TO FIND COMMON GROUND. ON SEVERAL ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED DESPITE THE FACT THAT THESE ISSUES WERE NOT BROUGHT TO US AND LET UNTIL LAST WEEK. WE'VE ALREADY SUGGESTED SEVERAL PROSPECTIVE AMENDMENTS AND WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ADVISED MUTUALLY AGREEABLE LANGUAGE. AS THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD. I HAVE ALREADY OFFERED AMENDMENTS THAT WOULD MOVE AWAY FROM THE ORIGINAL PROVISION MANDATING PHARMACY CLOSURES FOR THE FIRST VIOLATIONS. CLOSURES WOULD INSTEAD BE REPLACED WITH MONITORED SUPERVISION I AM PLEASED TO CONTINUING TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH THE CHAIR. THIS COMMITTEE AND OPPOSITION ON THIS ISSUE. ADDITIONALLY I'D LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT ONE ISSUE IN THE ANALYSIS WHICH WOULD LEAD TO MISUNDERSTANDING HERE. THE ANALYSIS PROVIDED TO YOU STATES THAT A VIOLATION WOULD RESULT IN A ONE MILLION DOLLAR FINE. IN ACTUALITY THE BILL LANGUAGE STATES THAT THE PENALTY MAY NOT EXCEED ONE MILLION DOLLARS AND IN MANY CASES DEPENDING ON THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF A VIOLATION. THE PENALTY IMPOSED COULD BE FAR LESS AS YOU ARE PROBABLY AWARE THERE IS AMPLE PRECEDENT IN CODE FOR THIS TYPE OF A DETERRENT. WITH ME VIRTUALLY TO TESTIFY THIS MORNING'S DR JENNIFER COURTNEY A TRUSTEE AT LARGE OF THE CALIFORNIA PHARMACISTS ASSOCIATION. IN ADDITION I ALSO TESTED RULE WITH U. S. C. W. WESTERN STATES COUNCIL AND MICHELLE RIVAS WITH THE PROFESSIONAL PHARMACISTS ASSOCIATION ON THE LINE. TO ANSWER ANY OTHER QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. DEPRIVE VOTE THIS MORNING. THANK YOU CENTER YOUR WITNESSES MAY PROCEED. ACCORDING HELLO CAN YOU HEAR ME. LOUD AND CLEAR PROCEED. THANK YOU SO MUCH- MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK AT THE COURT OF THIS IMPORTANT PIECE OF LEGISLATION.

CORPORATE INTERFERENCE INTO THE PRACTICE OF MOST HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONS THAT PROHIBITED. SAME SHOULD APPLY DEPARTMENT B. AS WELL. PHARMACISTS ARE HIGHLY EDUCATED HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS. WE ARE IN OUR DOCTORATE DEGREES AND PHARMACY AND WE ARE DOCTORS OF PHARMACY. ARMISTICE ALSO COMPLETE A MINIMUM OF FIFTEEN HUNDRED HOURS OF CLINICAL TRAINING AND ADDITION TO THEIR DIDACTIC COURSES. THE ROLE OF PHARMACISTS HAVE CHANGED DRASTICALLY OVER THE YEARS WE DON'T SIMPLY COUNT AND DEFENSE MEDICATION. RATHER RATHER WE PROVIDE COMPREHENSIVE PATIENT CARE AND ARE OFTEN THE MOST ACCESSIBLE HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS FOR MOST OF OUR PATIENTS. WE ARE THE MEDICATION EXPERTS. WE SHOULD NOT BE SUBJECTED TO ARBITRARY CORPORATE METRICS WHICH ARE INCONSISTENT WITH HOW OTHER HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS PERFORM THEIR DUTIES FOR THEIR PATIENTS. THESE METRICS OFTEN INTERFERE WITH OUR ABILITY TO PROCESS AND USE THEIR CLINICAL JUDGMENT AND INTERFERE WITH PATIENT CARE. CALIFORNIA MUST BE ON THE PRACTICES OF IMPOSING ARBITRARY BUSINESS METRICS ON PAR WITH THIS. THE PERPETRATOR AHEAD OF PROFIT OVER PATIENT CARE AND SAFETY.

THANK YOU- LIST MODERATOR. LET'S BRING THE DISCUSSION BACK TO MEMBERS HERE IN THE CHAMBER- FIRST- CENTER LEYVA FOLLOWING BY FOLLOWED BY SENATOR PAN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I WOULD LIKE TO THANK SENATOR NEWMAN FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS BILL AND IT'S PROBABLY BECAUSE I ABSOLUTELY HATE QUOTAS. I WILL BRING EVERYONE BACK TO A COUPLE YEARS-AGO WHEN WELLS FARGO IMPOSED QUOTAS AND THEY ULTIMATELY ENDED UP PAYING THREE BILLION DOLLARS IN PENALTIES BECAUSE THEIR EMPLOYEES FELT SO COMPELLED TO MEET THOSE QUOTAS THEY WERE ILLEGALLY AND FRAUDULENTLY SIGNING PEOPLE UP FOR ACCOUNTS THAT THEY DID NOT ASK FOR. THE QUOTAS RARELY DO WHAT THOSE WHO IMPOSE THEM THINK THAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO AS SOMEONE WHO REPRESENTED PHARMACISTS FOR TWENTY YEARS THESE ARE SOME OF THE MOST CARING AND KNOWLEDGEABLE AND CONCERNED PEOPLE I HAVE EVER MET. AND WORKED WITH QUOTAS ARE IMPOSED ON A PHARMACIST. YOU'RE NOT JUST SIGNING UP AN ACCOUNT THAT SOMEONE DIDN'T ASK FOR ONE PHARMACISTS ARE PUSHED TO THE TO THE EDGE. BOTH LIVES COULD pBE IN DANGER SO I THINK ALSO THAT THE PENALTY PART- YOU KNOW PEOPLE DON'T LIKE PENALTIES CORPORATIONS DELAY PENALTIES BUT WITHOUT A PENALTY IS JUST A SUGGESTION. SO YOU HAVE TO PUT A PENALTY IN PLACE IF YOU REALLY WANT THE POLICY TO BE CARRIED OUT. THEN WHEN THE OPPOSITION TALKED ABOUT THE PERFORMANCE METRICS THAT THEY WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO BE PUT IN PLACE I JUST THINK THAT THERE ARE SO MANY WAYS THAT YOU THAT A COMPANY HAS AN ABILITY. TO SEE IF A PHARMACIST IS PERFORMING OR PHARMACY IS PERFORMING LIKE OTHER RELATIVE TO THEIR PEERS. MAYBE L. A. COUNTY LEVELS- PHARMACY WERE ONLY FILLING HUNDREDS PRESCRIPTION TODAY BUT MAYBE AT SENATOR NEWMAN'S PHARMACY. THEY ARE FILLING TWO HUNDRED TODAY WELL WHAT IS SENATOR NEWMAN DURING THAT CENTER LIVE IS NOT DOING SO THERE ARE OTHER WAYS THAN PERFORMANCE QUOTAS WHICH I WILL SAY ARE USUALLY PUT IN PLACE BY PEOPLE WHO. ARE ACTUALLY DOING THE JOB TO GET THAT KNOWLEDGE I HAVE EVERY CONFIDENCE IN THE WORLD THAT SENATOR NEWMAN WILL WORK WITH ALL CONCERNED PARTIES. AND GET TO A POINT WHERE EVERYBODY'S A LITTLE HAPPY AND A LITTLE UNHAPPY BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY THE COMMUNITIES WILL BE PROTECTED I LOOK FORWARD TO VOTING I ON THIS BILL. THANK YOU CENTER LEYVA CENTER PAN. I THANK YOU THIS CHAIR- FIRST OF ALL I EIGHT- SENTIMENT OF. CERTAINLY PRETTY FISHY THAT- ONES REPORTER ASPECTS OF THIS BILL IS THAT WE NEED TO RESPECT THAT PHARMACISTS ARE HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS AND NEED TO BE ABLE TO EXERCISE THEIR- OWN JUDGEMENT. TO BE ABLE TO PUT OUR PATIENTS FIRST AND I THINK THAT'S THE HEART OF THE BILL. YOU HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT THE DEFINITION OF QUOTAS AND- A CERTAINLY. I SHARE MANY OF- CENTER LEADERS CONCERNED ABOUT QUOTAS THAT THEN ACTUALLY INTERFERE WITH OR- THE JUDGE THE PROFESSIONAL JUDGMENT PHARMACIST OR PUT REQUIREMENTS ALL THEM THAT CAUSED THEM. THAT WOULD PUT PRESSURE ON THEM TO- EITHER CUT CORNERS OR- NOT BE ABLE TO. EXERCISE. BASICALLY ACT OF EARLY- IN FOR THE PATIENT BUT GUESS IN TERMS A QUOTE THE- THE DEFINITION QUOTAS SO WE DO HAVE SOME CALL IT WE DO HAVE. VARIOUS QUALITY METRICS ARE DEFINED BY NATIONAL QUALITY ORGANIZATIONS LIKE NATIONAL QUALITY FORUM AND SO FORTH- IS ARE. IN AND SO WILL THOSE AND NOT BE I MEAN WITH THOSE BE POTENTIALLY CONSIDERED QUOTAS OR CAN YOU JUST MAYBE TOUCH ON OR PERHAPS SPONSORS MIGHT MIGHT TOUCH ON WE DO HAVE SOME QUALITY MEASURES THAT ARE OUT THERE. THAT ARE PUT FORTH BY ACTUALLY NATIONAL QUALITY ORGANIZATIONS OR BY LET'S SAY THE PERFECT THE PHARMACISTS ASSOCIATION SELF SO THE ASSOCIATION THAT REPRESENTS PHARMACISTS WOULD THOSE BE- EXCEPT WITH. AN SO. BASICALLY WITH THIS. I I'M SURE IT DOES WILL BE IN. QUOTAS BECAUSE REQUIRE MEASURES. I GUY TO THINK A PERK. DR PRINCE SO- TO BE CLEAR IT THE- COMMITTEE FINDINGS USE THE PHRASE PERFORMANCE METRICS AND PERFORMANCE SCORES- NO IN THE BILL THE CARD. DID WILL YOU FIND THE PHRASE PERFORMANCE QUOTA. BUT I DO APPRECIATE THE NEED FOR- UNAMBIGUOUS AND NON AMBIGUITY IF THAT'S THE RIGHT PHRASE. THAT IT'S BETTER TO WORK WITH. THE COMMITTEE WILL WORK WITH. THE OPPOSITE MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS NO AMBIGUITY. THAT WHAT WE'RE DURING TO DO HERE- AND I HOPEFULLY MADE IT CLEAR IN MY OPENS- USED TO REMOVE THOSE. QUOTAS RIGHT SPECIFICALLY. THAT RELATE TO CORPORATE PRACTICES OF CORPORATE INSTANCE SALES- THAT WOULD OTHERWISE INTERFERE WITH A LICENSED PHARMACIST BUT BUILT TO DO THEIR JOB WITH A CLEAR MIND- BUT THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT WE WOULD PREVENT. THE THEIR EMPLOYER FROM OF VALUE IN THE PERFORMANCE AND SOME SOUND BASIS. IT'S A GREAT GUY YOU KNOW GLAD TO WORK WITH. ALL PARTIES TO MAKE SURE THAT IS CLEAR IN THE FINAL VERSION THIS BILL OKAY NO I APPRECIATE THAT AND CERTAINLY- I WILL BE VOTING FOR THE BILL TO KEEP IT MOVING FORWARD I HOPE YOU'LL BE LOOKING AT PERHAPS. ON A CALL EXCEPTION JUST TO BE CLEAR TO CLARIFICATION THAT A AND A NATIONAL QUALITY MEASURE DEATHS- I SUPPORTED BY THE PROFESSION ITSELF OF PHARMACY. ARE BOARDED- BY THE INTERNATIONAL QUALITY MEASURES- DEBT COLLECTION DATA FOR THOSE WOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED- THE- THE PROBLEM IN THIS INDIGENOUS PROTECTED PARTICULAR BILL THANK YOU KNOW GREAT AND JUST TO ADD. PREFIGURE POINTS SO YOU KNOW THOUGH THAT DATA METRICS ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE KIND OF A YOU KNOW A BETTER GLOBAL VIEW OF HAVING SHE WORKS HOW CAN pTRYING TO DO IS. GLAD TO ALLOW THAT- BUT DON'T WANT THE EMPLOYER TO PLACE YOU KNOW OTHER BURDENS ON THE PART. OF PHARMACY SAID ACTUALLY INTERFERE WITH THAT. HE THANK YOU A CENTER PAN CENTER. A YES MISTER CHAIRMAN YOU I THINK THERE'S A LOT THIS BILL TO- IS REALLY REAL GOOD THAT REALLY- PATIENT SAFETY. AND I THINK THAT THAT'S- YOU KNOW. I'M VERY PLEASED ABOUT THAT IF YOU GO DOWN ON THIS QUOTA ISSUE AND REALLY TO SENATOR PAINTS POINT I. YOU'RE JUST READING THROUGH THE ANALYSIS AND EVERYTHING I WOULD THINK QUALITY MEASURES. THAT YOU HAVE GOALS FOR WOULD BE PART OF A QUOTA AND THAT VERY MUCH CONCERNS B. I WROTE THE BILL ON THE WELLS FARGO QUOTA THEY DID PUT A BIG ANEL IS THE END FOR WELLS FARGO I DON'T THINK THEY WERE EVEN A MILLION BUCKS BUT- BE THAT AS IT MAY- BUT I THINK THAT THE- PROGRAMS OFFERED TO PATIENTS. IT IS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT ON WE SHOULD NOT ALLOW OUR PHARMACISTS TO BE HAVE QUOTAS ON ANY OF THAT TYPE OF. REVENUE OBTAINED SAME THING. I THINK THAT THAT REALLY OBSCURES PATIENT- QUALITY. AND- SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED. BUT IF THE METRICS OF SOME KIND FOR PRESCRIPTIONS BUILDING SERVICES. RENDERED TO PATIENTS. CAN BE IMPORTANT BECAUSE- I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY OF YOU EVER FELT. THAT IN IN A BIT IN LINE AT A YOU KNOW AT A PHARMACY AND WAIT WAIT WAIT WAIT WAIT. YOU KNOW WHAT I DON'T WANT TO DO HERE IS- HAVE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF THE BILL BECAUSE OF THE LANGUAGE IN THE BILL AND ALL THE SIDE NOW- WE HAVE OUR CONSTITUENTS. WAITING LONGER LINES THAN THEY EVER HAD HAD BEFORE I THINK THE FINANCE FRANKLY I FIND THEM OUTRAGEOUS- WE TALK ALL THE TIME ABOUT THE COST OF DOING BUSINESS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. BUT OFTENTIMES WE VOTE ON BILLS WE'RE JUST NOT THERE. I DO HEAR THE- I'D I DID NOT HEAR ABOUT. THE BILL'S AUTHOR REALLY COMMENT ON THIS BUT I'D LIKE TO SEE HIM- MOVE FORWARD IN IN IN IN INTO THIS IN A MANNER. LOOK AT WHETHER YOU'RE A CORPORATION. I KNOW THAT WE ALL TEND TO BRING CORPORATIONS IS BIG BAD. THINGS IN OUR SOCIETY WELL THE REALITY IS I DON'T BELIEVE THAT'S TRUE I THINK THERE ARE SOME THAT. YOU KNOW CLEARLY ARE IN THEIR BEHAVIOR SETS FORTH- THAT REPUTATION BUT NEVER THE LESS I THINK WE NEED TO HAVE SOMETHING THAT'S REALLY- YOU KNOW. SOMETHING BETTER. AND THEN I WONDER WHAT. IT WHAT IS THE BOARD OF PHARMACY DO HERE I MEAN WHY DON'T THEY HAVE POLICIES- WHY DON'T THEY SET THE STANDARDS ON THESE TYPE OF THINGS AND WHY ARE WE DOING THAT IN THIS WORLD. I'M SORRY TO KEEP GOING ON MISTER CHAIRMAN BUT IN THE ANALYSIS- YEAH WE TALK ABOUT HERS- ONE OF THE SPEAKERS SAY PARTICULARLY THIS BILLS IMPORTANT WITH PHARMACISTS WILL BE CALLED UPON TO VACCINATE TENS OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WHEN THEY ALREADY HAVE OVERWHELMING WORKLOAD. WELL WE'RE PUTTING A BILL IN THE STATUTE THAT'S GOING TO STAND WAY OUT PAST THE COVE IN NINETEEN SITUATION THAT'S A CONCERN TO ME- IT THEN WE HAVE UNSOURCED REP. AND SOURCE REFERENCE WANTED US PERMISSION TO READ. FACEBOOK ONE INVESTIGATION DOCUMENTS- PHARMACISTS FEAR OF LOSING HIS JOB IF HE DOES NOT COMPLY WITH QUOTAS. NO DATE NO SOURCES THEN THE SECOND SOURCES IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN DOT DOT DOT DOT DOT A. B. SO I AM AT ELEVEN. CLEARLY SOME WERE ALSO IN THE- ANALYSIS THERE'S A TWO THOUSAND TWELVE REFERENCE. SO ALREADY THAT'S TEN YEARS OLD BUT THEN IN FAIRNESS TO- THE PRO SIDE HERE THE NEW YORK TIMES ARTICLE WITH THE TWENTY TWENTY YOUR ISSUE SO I'M NOT SAYING THAT THIS BILL WAS NOT NECESSARY IN FACT I THINK THERE'S A LOT IN THIS BILL THAT WE SHOULD BE MOVING IT- BUT I'D LIKE TO SEE THE AUTHOR I I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY. EVEN AFTER ALL THE ARGUMENTS I'VE MADE AGAINST THIS BILL BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT SENATOR- WILL- YOUR WORK ON THIS. IT WORK ON THESE ISSUES. TO DO IT BUT I RESERVE THE RIGHT- ON THE FLOOR TO OPPOSE THIS BILL. IF I DON'T THINK IT'S GONE FAR ENOUGH THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN. THANK YOU US SENATE- CENTER EGGMAN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. HI RIGHT THIS IS A VERY INTERESTING BILL CENTER VERY INTERESTING BILL THAT I THINK IT'S GIVE US ALL A LAW ALL A LOT OF TIMES TO STOP AND- THINK. AND THINK ABOUT OUR OWN EXPERIENCES AND- THROUGH. THROUGH MY EXPERIENCE I'VE SERVED ON BMP NOW IT IS MY SECOND HOUSE I'VE HAD SOME HISTORY. ON THIS COMMITTEE. AND WHEN YOU TALKED ABOUT NOW WE'RE ASKING PHARMACISTS TO DO EVERYTHING. ALL THESE NEW THINGS. THAT MEAN OPTOMETRIST PHARMACIST EVERYBODY HAS ASKED US IF THEY CAN DO MORE THINGS RIGHT IT'S NOT IT'S NOT AS REQUIRING PEOPLE TO DO MORE. IT IS THE PROFESSIONS COMING TO US AND SAYING. IN THE SCOPE OF OUR PRACTICE IN THE SCOPE OF OUR LICENSE WE ARE WE CAN'T DO MORE WE CAN DO MORE. AND SO IT'S OKAY TO MORE NOW. L. MAN SO WE HAVE GOING ON. AND THEN AT THE SAME TIME WE HAVE THE CONSOLIDATION OF BUSINESSES SO MORE MORE THE SMALL PHARMACIES MINE THE SMALL PHARMACY WE USE FOR EVER FORTY NINE OR DRUGS. WHICH WAS THERE IN STOCK IN OVER A HUNDRED YEARS NOW GOING OUT OF BUSINESS. TO TRY TO FIND A SMALLER ONE IT'S VERY DIFFICULT BECAUSE OF THE PROLIFERATION OF THESE LARGER ONES. JIM IT'S AN EASIER OR MORE. BUYING IN BULK IS AN EASIER WAY TO DO BUSINESS JUST TO SAY- SO I THINK WE'RE GONNA SEE MORE MORE THIS SO AS WE BEGIN TO SEE MORE CARE. PHARMACY OPTOMETRIST. ALLERGIST DERMATOLOGIST. IN IN THESE MORE CORPORATE TYPE SETTINGS. ARE WE GOING TO PUT OURSELVES IN A POSITION. THAT WE YOU KNOW WE HAVE A CORPORATE BROWN ON MEDICINE YOU CAN'T HIGHER POSITIONS BECAUSE THE SAME THING BUT HE'S A PHARMACIST WHO ARE EMPLOYEES. OF A CORPORATION BEING ASKED DIEM SO I AGREE WITH CENTER DOT I DON'T I DON'T I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD HAVE QUOTAS. FOR THE SAME TIME IF SOMEBODY IS AN EMPLOYEE YOU NEED TO HAVE SOME KIND OF METRICS TO EVALUATE THEIR PERFORMANCE BY- AND I THOUGHT THE- THE OPPOSITION THE ISSUE ABOUT MEDICAL OR- PHARMACY TECHNICIANS WAS ALSO GOOD POINT. THEY DO BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE MORE CAPACITY TO BE ABLE TO HAVE MORE SUPPORT OF- THAT TO BE ABLE TO KEEP THE PROCESS MOVING A LOT MORE SUPPORT PROFESSIONS ALLIED PROFESSIONS. SO ANYWAY I AM ALSO GOING TO SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY BUT I DO THINK IT RAISES A LOT OF INTERESTING ISSUES- ABOUT WHERE WE END UP IF WE KEEP EXTENDING. THE ABILITY FOR PEOPLE TO PRACTICE AND DIFFERENT KINDS OF SETTINGS. THEN IT HOW DOES THAT FIT INTO THE SETTINGS THAT ARE BEING CREATED. THROUGH WITH OUR SAME PROCESS. OF EVOLUTION SO- NOT REALLY A QUESTION I GUESS BUT A LOT OF. A LOT OF PONDERING. I APPRECIATE THAT SO THANK YOU- CENTER EGGMAN CENTER BATES. THANK YOU I JUST LIKE TO CONCUR WITH MY COLLEAGUES ON ON SOME OF THE VERY GOOD AND NOBLE POINTS IN THE FIELD THAT TIME TO ISSUES THAT ARE REALLY TROUBLING. FOR ME TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT IT TODAY AS THAT OF. THE PENALTY FOR ONE IN A CHAIN WOULD EXPAND TO ALL IN A CHAIN AND THAT COULD CLOSE ON HUNDREDS OF PHARMACIES ACROSS THE STATE AND THAT WOULD PUT THEM OUT OF BUSINESS AND REALLY POTENTIALLY HARM. ARE PROBABLY HUNDREDS IF NOT THOUSANDS OF INDIVIDUALS USING THOSE PHARMACIES THAT SAY IT'S AN RIDE DATA WALL GRAINS WHEREVER THAT HAPPENS TO BE SO I THINK WE NEED TO TAKE A LOOK AT. THE PENALTIES SPECIFICALLY AND HOW THAT WOULD AFFECT A WHOLE CHAIN NUMBER TWO IS THE DEFINITION OF A COMMUNITY PHARMACY. ARE WE HAVE ONE IN OUR MIND MY COMMUNITY THAT'S REALLY AREN'T INDEPENDENTLY OWNED AND OPERATED BY A PHARMACIST YET HE COULD BE OR THEY COULD BE DEFINED AS A COMMUNITY PHARMACY MAKE ONE MISTAKE AND- I BELIEVE THAT PARTICULAR COUNTY WILL PUT THEM BASICALLY OUT OF BUSINESS AND THEY ARE A COMPOUNDING. PHARMACY LIKE OUR FORMER COLLEAGUE SENATOR- JEFF STONE HOW'D YOU KNOW AND- DO A LOT OF VERY SIGNIFICANT WORK AND COMING UP WITH THOSE COMPOUNDS THAT ARE VERY VERY IMPORTANT TO INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE A SPECIAL NEEDS SO I THINK THOSE TWO AREAS NEED A LOT MORE WORK. THAT TIME CERTAINLY ON THE GOOD SENATOR FROM YOU CALL YOU FROM ORANGE COUNTY I THINK. IF OF PUTTING SOMETHING OUT THERE THAT CERTAINLY NEEDS A CLOSER LOOK CALM ON THE QUALITY ISSUE THAT TIME I WILL BE SUPPORTING IT TODAY AND HOPE THAT WE'LL GET CLOSER TO WHAT IS A BALANCE. OF FOUR OUR CHAIN PHARMACIES THAT ARE INDEPENDENT PHARMACIES AND MORE IMPORTANTLY OUR OUR CONSTITUENTS ON IF THE VERY VITAL SERVICE SAW CERTAINLY FOR ALL OF US. THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER BATES CINNAMON. THANK YOU MR CARE- I APPRECIATE COME OF US. THEY AND- YES I THINK INTERESTING IS IT TO DESCRIBE THE BECAUSE IT DOES RAISE ALLOW OF ISSUES. YOU KNOW CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE COIN OF THE BILL OF TRYING TO PROTECT CONSUMERS. TRYING TO ELIMINATE BAD BUSINESS PRACTICES. AT THE SAME TIME YOU KNOW WE TALK ABOUT THESE COMPANIES LIKE CVS AND WALGREENS- THEY'RE TRYING TO. ENSURE THAT THEY'RE PROVIDING GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE THAT THEY'RE KEEPING GOOD PHARMACISTS AND- SO IS TOUGH IN SOME WAYS BECAUSE THEY'RE THERE THEY ARE VERY LARGE ORGANIZATION THEY'RE TRYING TO. HEAR THE PRACTICES OF CORPORATE GOVERNANCE I GUESS MY QUESTION AND THEN I HAD A COMMENT AFTER THAT- IS CENTER NEWMAN IS- YOU KNOW YOUR BILL WOULD. AS I UNDERSTAND PROACTIVE CERTAIN. THINGS FROM USED AS A FIX. OR NUMBER. TO PRESS FILLED SERVICES RAND. PROGRAMS OFF AROUND TEN AND I GUESS MY IS THIS PROVIDE THE U. OF THOSE. AS FACT AND I THOUGHT YOU I KNOW SENATE FINANCE OF COURSE. BUT I WAS CLEAR IN THE ANSWER- OR IT'S JUST- THE IS LIKE STRAIGHT LINE. NOW LIKE LAKE EFFECT COMPANY LIKE C. V. SAID- WE THINK PRESCRIPTIONS FILLED. ANY SEVEN BACK I THINK OF THIS FOR AN EDGE. PER WHERE RACE WAS- ELIMINATED YOU CANNOT USE RACE AS A QUOTE OF IT BUT IT CAN BE USED AS A FACTORIN THE SUPREME COURT'S. DECISION BAKI. IT AND I GUESS THE QUESTION I HAVE IS COULD THESE THINGS TO BE USED AS FACTORS IF AN EMPLOYEE. A PHARMACIST WAS YOU KNOW JUST CONSISTENTLY BEHIND ON NUMBER PRESCRIPTIONS FILLED SERVICES RENDERED- COULD THAT. B. USES A FACTOR IN IN HOW THE COMPANY PROCEED. SURELY THERE IS A GOOD QUESTION SO- I THINK THERE IS ANY QUESTION SO IS FACTORS SO THAT YOU KNOW THERE'S NOTHING STOPPING. A AN EMPLOYER FROM USING. THOSE METRICS ON AN ANNUAL BASIS FOR ASSESSING PERFORMANCE WHAT WERE ENDEAVOR TO DO IS TO PREVENT THE ASSIGNMENT OF QUOTAS FROM INFLUENCING THE WORK IN INTERFERING WITH THE JUDGMENT OF A PROFESSIONAL PHARMACIST SO EASIER TO TRACK DATA- REASONABLE I THINK TO MEASURE SOMEBODY. PERFORMANCE IN THE AGGREGATE OVER YOUR- BUT WHAT WE DON'T WANT. IS FOR- MEASURES OR INCENTIVES THAT HAVE BOTHERED TO DO WITH PATIENT CARE YEP- FROM BEING CENTRAL TO THAT PHARMACISTS WORK HOPE OF INTEGRATION YEAH NO AND I SAID REALLY SUPPORT THAT GOAL AND I GUESS THE QUESTION IS A YOU KNOW AND I THINK CENTER EGGMAN REALLY ELOQUENTLY DESCRIBED THIS. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT YOU KNOW THE LAW IT'S OFTEN AN INARTICULATE A BLUNT INSTRUMENT. AND- YOU KNOW THIS DOES RAISE QUESTIONS SO. AM GLAD THAT YOU'RE OPEN TO AMENDMENTS- YOU KNOW I WILL SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY AND JUST INTEREST INTERESTED TO SEE HOW PROCEEDS BUT- I THINK. YOU KNOW I WILL CONCUR WITH MY COLLEAGUES- ABOUT SOME OF JUST THE OVER ARCHING CONCERNS TO GET REYES. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENTIMENTALITY ANY FURTHER COMMENTS. LET ME- FOR MINE YOU KNOW AND THINKING ABOUT THIS QUOTA ISSUE AND AS YOU KNOW I CAME OUT OF THE NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARD WERE. PRODUCTION QUOTAS WITHIN A UNIONIZED SETTING WE'RE CERTAINLY ISSUES OF MANDATORY SUBJECT TO MANDATORY. COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AND I WROTE RECOGNIZE HERE WE HAVE BOTH- UNIONIZED FACILITIES AND NON UNIONIZED FACILITIES SO. THAT'S REALLY AN ISSUE FOR ANOTHER DAY. BUT I WAS STRUCK BY THE FACT THE AS I THOUGHT ABOUT IT THAT REALLY A PHARMACY IS NOT A WAREHOUSE- AND THEY HAVE DIFFERENT MISSIONS. A DIFFERENT- EMPLOYEES DOING DIFFERENT THINGS. I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THE PERFORMANCE EVALUATION ISSUE AND SO IS THIS BILL I'M SURE MOVES FORWARD. OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE IDEAS THAT YOU TAKE A- MORE- DETAILED LOOK AT THE AT THE ISSUE OF PERFORMANCE EVALUATION TO MAKE SURE THAT THE LANGUAGE OF THE BILL CLARIFIES THAT EMPLOYERS. CERTAINLY HAVE THE ABILITY AND THE RIGHT TO EVALUATE APPROPRIATELY- BY THE PERFORMANCE OF EMPLOYEES IN THEIR EMPLOY. AND PERHAPS AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM SACRAMENTO INDICATED. SPEND MORE TIME- DEFINING THE USE OF BENCHMARKS. WHICH TYPICALLY ARE UTILIZED IN THE MEDICAL FIELD FOR A WHOLE VARIETY OF- OF REASONS AND ISSUES INCLUDING. THE QUALITY CONTROL WHICH IN ESSENCE IS THE VERY ESSENCE OF PERFORMANCE SO. WITH THAT I WILL BE- SUPPORTING THE BILL. BUT DO WE HAVE A CENTER NEWMAN WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE AND THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR SO. I DISS. I THINK THE FIRST TIME I'VE HEARD OF BILLS CRIME ALL THE TIME JUST INTERESTING- REMINDS ME OF A SEINFELD EPISODE ABOUT THE INTERESTING LOOKING BABIES. CLICK HERE TO DISCOVER BABY IS INTERESTING YOU. THINK SOMEBODY ELSE- LET LET ME RESPOND AND CLOSE VERY QUICK BECAUSE I SOME OF THE VERY GOOD QUESTIONS ASKED- WITH RESPECT TO THE PENALTY QUESTION. TO BE CLEAR. YOU KNOW THE PENALTY WOULD ONLY APPLY IT IN AN INSTANCE WHERE THE VIOLATION WAS DIRECTLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO CORPORATE POLICY- SO IN THE CASE WERE A BRANCH. OR AN EMPLOYEE TO BRANCH WERE FOR- THE YOU KNOW SAY THE MANAGER. WERE WERE APPLYING. QUOTAS UNLESS THAT WAS A CORPORATE POLICY THE POLICY WILL NOT APPLY MOREOVER- YOU KNOW WE MAY PROVISIONS- TO ENSURE A SORT OF A YOU KNOW THE TO REASONABLE STEP. STEPPING UP OF PENALTIES TO INCLUDE A WARNING. SECONDLY YOU KNOW I THINKIT IS. RELEVANT TO THIS NOTION COMMUNITY PHARMACIES THAT THAT IS FOR WHATEVER REASON KIND OF A TERM OF ART- IN THE EXISTING LEGISLATION THAT IS THE TERM THAT USE REFERRED ALL PHARMACIES SO THAT MIGHT BE. WORTHY OF TIGHTENING UP- BUT- YOU KNOW I DO. THAT AND APPRECIATE THE INPUT OF ALL MY COLLEAGUES HERE- WE NEED TO MAKE SURE. THAT WE DON'T UNINTENTIONALLY CREATE MORE PROBLEMS THAN WE SOLVE I THINK THAT'S TRUE ALL LEGISLATION- BUT GENERALLY I THINK PUT IT WELL. YOU CAN'T FIND MANY GOOD EXAMPLES WHERE CORPORATE QUOTAS. LEAD TO UNAMBIGUOUSLY GOOD RESULTS- IF ANYTHING- THEY TEND TO CREATE SYSTEMIC INCENTIVES FOR MISBEHAVIOR- AND IN THIS CASE I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT. TO CONSIDER THE VALUE OF NOT LETTING THAT HAPPEN- PHARMACISTS ARE IN FACT THE LAST- BARRIER IN SOME CASES TO REALLY DANGEROUS CONSEQUENCES. IN THE USE OF DRUGS AND IN FACT WE'VE ASKED PHARMACISTS IN THE IN THE HEAT OF THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC. TO DO SOME REALLY EXPLICIT THINGS THEY REQUIRE REQUIRED BY LAW. TO TRACK A SERIES OF RED FLAGS ANYTHING THAT GETS IN THE WAY OF THAT OR OTHER- DELIBERATE CARE OF THEIR PATIENTS- IT SHOULD BE AVOIDED- AND SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL TODAY.

I SEE CENTER BORJAS IN THE CHAMBER LET'S MOVE TO FILE ITEM NUMBER THREE SENATE BILL FOUR THREE ZERO SIR BORDERS. GOOD MORNING. GERMAN THANK YOU MEMBERS FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT TODAY SAID A BILL FOR THIRTY A BILL THAT WILL HELP SMALL BUSINESSES BY CREATING A PROCESS BY WHICH STATE AGENCIES CAN ESTABLISH PROCEDURES FOR THE REDUCTION OF CIVIL PENALTIES UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES. THIS BILL PASSED UNANIMOUSLY OUT OF THE GOVERNMENT ORGANIZATION COMMITTEE TWO WEEKS AGO AND CLOSELY RESEMBLES SB FOURTEEN FIFTY SEVEN WHICH LAST YEAR PASSED OUT OF THE SENATE UNANIMOUSLY. BUT UNFORTUNATELY WAS STALLED BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC. MANY SMALL BUSINESSES DO NOT HAVE THE SAME ORGANIZATIONAL RESOURCES AVAILABLE AS LARGER COMPANIES SUCH AS HAVING LEGAL DEPARTMENTS AND COMPLIANCE DEPARTMENTS. THIS CAN IMPARTIALLY RESULT IN A VERY REAL OPPORTUNITY IMBALANCE BETWEEN MEDIUM AND LARGE CORPORATIONS AND SMALL MOM AND POPS TRYING TO SURVIVE IN CALIFORNIA. MODELED AFTER THE SMALL BUSINESS REGULATORY ENFORCEMENT ACT PASSED BY CONGRESS IN THE NINETIES SB FOUR THREE ZERO DOES NOT. REPEAT DOES NOT LESSEN REGULATORY STANDARDS FOR REDUCE THE RULE MAKING AUTHORITY OF THE STATE AGENCIES. INSTEAD IT SEEKS TO PREVENT PENALTIES FOR MINOR INFRACTIONS FROM LEADING TO FINANCIAL RUIN. UNDER THIS BILL SMALL BUSINESSES ARE REQUIRED TO MEET CERTAIN CRITERIA TO QUALIFY FOR PENALTY REDUCTION. INCLUDING THAT THE VIOLATION DID NOT INVOLVE WILLFUL OR CRIMINAL CONDUCT IT DID NOT POSE A SERIOUS HEALTH SAFETY OR ENVIRONMENTAL THREAT. SB FOUR THIRTY ALSO PROVIDES FACTORS FOR STATE AGENCIES SHOULD TO DETERMINE IF. IF AND TO WHAT EXTENT THE PENALTIES SHOULD BE REDUCED IF AT ALL WHICH INCLUDE. THE DEGREE TO WHICH SMALL BUSINESSES COOPERATED DURING ANY INVESTIGATION. ENGAGE IN SUBSEQUENT ACTION TO CORRECT THE VIOLATION. PRIOR HISTORY OF MEETING REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS IF THE PENALTY WOULD IMPEDE THE SMALL BUSINESSES FROM CONTINUING TO OPERATE IN IF THE ACTIONS WERE NEGLIGENT. STATE AGENCIES WOULD ALSO BE AUTHORIZED TO APPLY CONDITIONS TO THE REDUCTION OF PENALTIES INCLUDING REQUIRING THE SMALL BUSINESSES TAKE CORRECTIVE ACTION OR TEN SPECIFIED TRAINING. COLLEAGUES THOUSANDS OF SMALL BUSINESSES HAVE SHUTTERED THEIR DOORS DURING THE PANDEMIC IN MANY MORE WILL FOLLOW. NOW MORE THAN EVER CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO TAKE INSTITUTIONAL ACTION TO PROVIDE REGULATORY FINANCIAL RELIEF TO SMALL BUSINESSES THAT ARE A VITAL PART OF OUR COMMUNITY. PRIORITIZING THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF OUR COMMUNITY WHILE ALSO SUPPORTING MEASURES TO RESPONSIBLY AND SUSTAINABLY STRENGTHEN OUR ECONOMY IS A RESPONSIBILITY WE HAVE AS A LEGISLATIVE BODY. COLLEAGUES I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE ON SB FOUR THIRTY. CENTERS MY UNDERSTANDING YOU HAVE SOME LEAD WITNESSES ON THE PHONE WOULD YOU IDENTIFY THEM PLEASE. BEAR WITH ME. CAN YOU HEAR ME.

EACH YEAR WE SURVEYED CHAMBER MEMBERS AND CONSISTENTLY AMONG THEIR TOP CONCERNS IS THE BURDENSOME COSTS OF COMPLYING WITH AN EVER INCREASING NUMBER AND COMPLEXITY OF STATE REGULATIONS AS SENATOR BORDERS NOTED SMALL BUSINESSES DON'T HAVE THE STAFF OR RESOURCES AS THE LARGER BUSINESSES AND CORPORATIONS TO NAVIGATE THE STATE'S BUREAUCRACY. WITH SB FOUR THIRTY THE LEGISLATURE HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO RECOGNIZE THE CRITICAL IMPORTANCE OF SMALL BUSINESSES TO OUR STATE'S ECONOMY AND SERVE AS A PARTNER IN THEIR SUCCESS SB FOUR THIRTY LEVERAGES THE GOOD WORK OF SMALL BUSINESS ADVOCATE STATE DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES ENABLE THEM TO ASSIST SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS AND OPERATORS AND AVOIDING. NON COMPLIANCE AND IN SOME INSTANCES PROVIDE A REDUCTION OR WAIVER OF COSTLY FEES WHILE THE SAME TIME INCLUDING PROTECTIONS TO ENSURE SOME BAD ACTORS DON'T BENEFIT FROM THESE CHANGES I RESPECTFULLY URGE YOUR AYE VOTE ON SB FOUR THIRTY AT THE MUCH NEEDED RELIEF TO CALIFORNIA SMALL BUSINESSES THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER BUTLER DO WE HAVE MISTER GOODEN WITH THE CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURERS.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MITCH SNIDER WITH THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL FORWARD OBVIOUSLY SYMPATHETIC TO ALL OF THE STRUGGLES EMPLOYERS ARE GOING THROUGH DURING THE PANDEMIC WE THINK THAT- THIS BILL REALLY DOES CREATE A DIRECT RISK TO THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF WORKERS AND REMAIN OPPOSED TO THAT. AS WRITTEN THIS BILL WOULD DIRECT STATE AGENCIES TO EITHER TOTALLY ELIMINATE OR REDUCE PENALTIES FOR SOMEWHERE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF 97% OF ALL BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA THAT MEETING CERTAIN CRITERIA AND JUST TO TAKE THE EXAMPLE OF WORKER HEALTH AND SAFETY REGULATIONS WE HAVE A VERY FEDERAL BODY OF LAW THAT DEFINES THINGS LIKE SERIOUS VIOLATIONS TO FIND THINGS LIKE. WILLFUL VIOLATIONS THIS WOULD APPEAR TO POTENTIALLY THROW ALL OF THOSE OUT AND START OVER IN A PROCESS THAT. DOESN'T INVOLVE WORKERS IN ANYWAY TO HAVE THE WHAT THE DOCTOR OF THESE WOULD BE AN THE EFFECT WOULD IS THAT COMPANIES WOULD EITHER GO AWAY ENTIRELY OR BE REDUCE SICKNESS. AND IN TURN REDUCE INCENTIVE TO COMPLY WITH THOSE LAWS THAT HAVE DONE A JOB SO FAR WHERE THEY CAN APPLY IN KEEPING WORKERS PURGING OF TO PROTECT WORK FROM EXPOSURE TO THE BY AND WE THIS BILL.

I KNOW WHEN THE SIGNAL THAT THEY WISH TO SPEAK THANK YOU MR MODERATOR ANOTHER WE'VE HEARD FROM ALL SUPPORT IN OPPOSITION WITNESSES LET'S MOVE THE DISCUSSION BACK TO MY COLLEAGUES ON THE SENATE FLOOR SENATOR PAM. THANK YOU- CHAIR AND- THE NEXT ONE THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AS A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND SOME OF THE MAJOR FRUSTRATIONS- FOR SMALL BUSINESS THAT DOESN'T. NECESSARY HAVE A LEGAL DEPARTMENT OUR HR DEPARTMENT OR SO FORTH BUT- I DID HAVE SOME QUESTIONS- ACCORDING THIS BILL- SO FIRST OF ALL- I MEAN THERE'S CERTAIN I WOULD SAY THERE'S NEW REGULATIONS AND WHICH PERHAPS AGAIN BEING A SMALL BUSINESS WOULD NOT NECESSARILY HAVE THE KIND OF TEAM A LARGER BUSINESS WOULD HAVE TO TRY TO ANALYZE. A NEW REGULATION ARE MAY NOT BE AS ENGAGES A LARGER BUSINESS MIGHT AND DEVELOPMENT OF A NEW REGULATION BUT THEN THERE ARE OTHER REGULATIONS THAT ARE LONG STANDING THAT. HOPEFULLY- THERE SHOULD BE MORE FAMILIARITY WITH THE BY ALL BUSINESSES AND WE CAN CERTAINLY HAVE A DISCUSSION ABOUT THE ROLE OF STATE AGENCIES AND HELPING. TO TACKLE SMALL BUSINESSES UNDERSTAND HOW TO COMPLY WITH THOSE REGULATIONS WHETHER WE'RE DOING ENOUGH THERE- BUT CAN YOU SPEAK TO. THE IS THIS BILL DISTINGUISH BETWEEN JOSE NEWER REGULATIONS THAN WHICH- SMALL BUSINESSES TRYING TO COMPLY MAY NOT OF NESTLE FIGURED IT OUT. VERSES AND LONG STANDING REGULATION IN WHICH THE SMALL BUSINESS CERTAINLY SHOULD. HOPEFULLY BEEN- FAIRLY AWARE OF AND COMPLIANCE SO- AND WHERE TO COMPLIANCE AT LEAST COMPLAINTS THAT REGULATION SHOULD BE MUCH CLEARER AS TO HOW TO COMPLY SO CAN YOU SPEAK TO THIS DOES THIS BILL DISTINGUISH BETWEEN. THOSE DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES ARE IS THIS TREATING ALL REGULATIONS THE SAME. RESEARCHER PLEASE RESPOND YES I WANT TO THANK THE A CENTER VERMONT SACRAMENTO- THAT'S A FANTASTIC QUESTION I'M REALLY GLAD THAT- THAT HE POSTED. I WANT MAKES IT SOMETHING VERY MAKE SOMETHING VERY CLEAR WITH THIS PROPOSED PIECE OF LEGISLATION IS THAT IT IS NOT MANDATING. THAT FINDS BE REDUCED FAT ALL. WHAT IS DOING IT IS- IT IS AUTHORIZING OF THE VARIOUS DEPARTMENTS AND REGULATORY ENTITIES- UNDER THE UMBRELLA OF THE STATE TO DEVISE THEIR OWN POLICIES THAT WOULD ALLOW FOR INDIVIDUALS- TO BE LOOKED UPON. UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES FOR FINANCIAL REDUCTION. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY IT DOES NOT TAKE AWAY THE ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY OF ANY DIVISION OF THE STATE. IT IS ONLY ALLOWING FOR A- A VEHICLE FOR DISCRETION TO BE EXERCISED SO TO YOUR POINT THIS AND THAT'S A PERFECT EXAMPLE YOU GET ITUATIONS WE HAVE EXISTING BUSINESSES TRYING TO DEAL WITH CUMBERSOME NEW REGULATIONS AND KEEP UP. OR YOU ACTUALLY HAVE EXISTING BUSINESSES- WITH THE BOULDER REGULATIONS AND VICE VERSA SO THIS COULD BE A NUMBER OF WAYS THIS PLAYS ITSELF OUT. I THINK GO TO YOUR POINT WHEN YOU HAVE A NEW BUSINESS AND THERE'S A TIRE BODY OF LAW AND REGULATION. IT IT'S CHALLENGES. WE HAVE AN EXISTING BUSINESS THAT IS EXPECTED TO ABIDE BY LONG STANDING LAWS. THEN THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT THE DISCRETION IN THE LEVELS OF ENQUIRIES BY THESE RELEVANT DEPARTMENTS SHOULD BE ABOUT. SHOULD YOU HAVE KNOWN. WERE YOU IN DECORATIONS IN NOT DOING X. Y. OR Z. IF YOU WERE THE PENALTY STANDS- THAT'S THE BEAUTY OF THIS PIECE LEGISLATION IT SIMPLY AUTHORIZES THESE INDIVIDUALS TO CREATE POLICIES. WITH THE PERSON'S MOST KNOWLEDGEABLE I CAN'T COMMENT ON A VISALIA RESTAURANT FACILITY FOR A SMALL BUSINESS CIRCUMSTANCE THAT WOULD COVER ALL CONTACTS THE PERSON'S MOST KNOWLEDGEABLE WILL BE ABLE TO WEIGH IN AT THAT MOMENT IN BE ABLE TO EXPLAIN. THIS WAS NEGLIGENCE OR THIS WAS WILLFUL OR THIS WAS ACCIDENTAL BUT SERIOUS IN WHICH CASE NO REDUCTION I WAS GONNA BE ON THE TABLE. AND ALSO JUST TO CLARIFY FOR EXAMPLE AND CHECKED EVEN HERE ON THE FLOOR TODAY WE'VE TALKED ABOUT POTENTIAL OBVIOUSLY CAN POTENTIAL LAWS BECAUSE THEY THEY HAVE PASSED YOUR YARD. FOR GENERALLY WE- WE MAY SET A PENALTY AT A RANGE. OR SAY A MAXIMUM OF. SO GIVEN THE FACT THAT WE'RE THE LEGISLATURE USUALLY PASS A BILL AND PUT ON THE GOVERNOR'S DESK WE WANTED TO BE AN SOURCE. IS THAT ARE WE GIVING AGENCIES DISCRETION TO. ACT IN A WAY THAT MAY NOT BE CONSISTENT WITH A SET OF PENALTIES THAT WE PASSED YEARS OF LEGISLATURE SO I MEAN SIZE WILL GIVE A RANGE SO I GET THAT OKAY FINE FOR CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE LOWER END TO RANGE VERSUS THE HIGHER IN THE RANGE. BUT ARE WE ALL SET SO IS THIS BILL SAYING THAT. THEY COULD. SO I COULDN'T. GO BE. THAT IS- YES SKILLED LOWERED THE RATE OF MORTALITY THAT WE ESTABLISHED HERE W. PASSED IN A PREVIOUS- PIECE OF LEGISLATION HERE I. INSIDE SCOPE. FIGURE OUT THE SCOPE OF THIS BILL CERTAINLY IF THE- DISCUSSION WE'RE GIVING THE AGENCY. CERTAINLY THANK YOU AGAIN THE INTERCONNECTEDNESS BETWEEN. OTHER BODIES OF LAW THAT WE WANT TO MAKE CERTAIN. THAT ARE BEING FILLED IN A BY THE BY. VERSES THIS IS THAT. IT IS ABSOLUTELY IF IT IS A PRIORITY BASED ON LEGISLATION OR A REGULATORY EXPECTATIONS THAT THERE BE A CERTAIN SET OF CONTACTS. ALL FOLLOW THROUGH ON. THAT WILL ABSOLUTELY BE REFLECTED. IN WHAT IS EXPECTED OF THOSE WITHIN THE RELEVANT IN RESPECTIVE INDUSTRIES. IT IS NOT INTENDED AT ALL. TWO CUT- ARM OF BY THIS SCANDAL BILLIONS OF THESE- REGULATIONS. IT IS ASKING HIS ASKING THE GOVERNMENT. TO BE MORE HUMAN. IN UNDERSTANDING WHAT IT'S LIKE UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES I'LL. GIVE YOU ONE IN PARTICULAR. D. SALINAS DOLLARS A- I ALSO JUST KIND OF THE TIME AT OTHER PLACES SINCE TWO BUT JUST TO CLARIFY- SO THIS BILL WOULD. BASICALLY YOU ENCOURAGING AGENCY TAX SOME DISCRETION BUT THAT THIS STILL HAS TO BE THE FOR. OF EXISTING. THAT WE FOR PASSED YEARS A LEGISLATURE ANOTHER WORDS IF WE SET A MINIMUM. THE AGENCY CAN'T WAIT AND- OF THE PANEL THAT HAS IT. AS STAFF CERTAINLY THE ADMITTED THE L. AGENCY WE OFTEN THEM SOME DISK. ENTER OF. PENALTY AND INTERPRETATION AND SO FORTH THAT'S WHY AND THEN THAT GOES REGULATORY PROCESS BUT THIS. BILL IS TALKING ABOUT REGULATION IT WOULDN'T ACTUALLY AFFECT THINGS ARE ACTUALLY IN CODE GIVE THEM UP UNTIL THE IN AGENCY OR AN ABILITY TO. ESSENTIALLY LEAVE A PART OF THE CODE THAT WE HAVE ACTUALLY. THAT WE AS A LEGISLATURE ACTUALLY PASSED. IF I GET A- YES YOU. SO THERE WASN'T MUCH OF A RESTAURANT IN VACAVILLE. AND THIS- THIS- WASN'T. AND SHE WAS FINED THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS- ON BECAUSE THERE WAS NOT THE PLASTIC- COVER ON THE ELECTRICAL OUTLET HEADING DOWN INTO THE BASEMENT IT WASN'T IN THE RESTAURANT. BUT IT WAS DOWN INTO INTO INTO THE BASEMENT AND SHE SAYS IF ID KNOWN THAT IT WOULD COST TWENTY FIVE CENTS. IN A IN IN IN IN BEEN COMPLIANT I WOULD HAVE DONE. BUT TO BE TO FIND THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS FOR TWENTY FIVE CENT PROBLEM KIND OF GOES AGAINST WHAT. THE PURPOSE OF GOVERNMENT IS IT IS TO PROMOTE PUBLIC HEALTH AND WELFARE IT IS ALSO TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT WE'RE LOOKING AFTER THE OUR ECONOMY. AND IN THAT IN THAT SPIRIT I BELIEVE WE CAN BRING A HUMAN ELEMENT TO THIS ISSUE WITHOUT MANDATING ANY. DISREGARD FOR EXISTING LAW TO YOUR POINT. AND THANK YOU AND I JUST WANT OTHER ONE LAST QUESTION FOR ME AT LEAST- V. IN THE DEADLY SIN IN ALICE'S INVENTIONS THAT- THIS NOTICE BY STATE CIVIL PENALTY WAIVER REDUCTION SHALL BE BY SMALL BUSINESS POINT FOR KATRINA VIOLATION DID NOT POSE A SERIOUS HEALTH SAFETY ENVIRONMENTAL THREAT- I THINK BY DEFINITION. A REGULATION RELATED THAT'S RELATED TO HEALTH SAFETY ENVIRONMENT. IS SUPPOSED TO BE- INTO TO REDUCE THE RISK OR THE THREAT OF THAT SO I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW THIS BILL- SO THIS BILL ESSENTIALLY EXEMPTS HEALTH SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS FROM THE- FROM THE PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL OR I'M- I'M JUST. FROM DEBT IS DOLLAR DOESN'T APPLY TO THIS PARTICULAR REGULATIONS I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY CERTAINLY THAT'S SOMETHING THE OPPOSITION RAISED CONCERNS ABOUT. AND WE DO HAVE YOU KNOW- WE DO HAVE. HEALTH AND SAFETY ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS FOR THE VERY REASON OF TRYING TO PREVENT THREATS SO INHERENTLY THOSE REGULATIONS- SHOULD NOT BE THE ONES THAT WERE. WAITING OR OR OR OR NOT TANTALIZING FOR SO I JUST WANTED TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE- HOWTHIS PROVISION OF LEASES DESCRIBED AND NOW IT SAYS. INTERFACES WITH THE OVERALL BILL. THANK YOU ONCE AGAIN I THINK I'M IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE DEFER TO THE PRACTICAL ELEMENTS OF- THE INTENT OF THIS BILL. AND THE REALITIES ON THE GROUND. AND SO THE PERSON'S MOST KNOWLEDGEABLE ARE THOSE THAT REPRESENT THIS THE DIVISIONS OF THE STATE IN A SPECIFIC- IN A SPECIFIC WAY OR SPECIFIC MANNER WITH A CERTAIN JURISDICTION. IF THOSE INDIVIDUALS ARE SAYING THAT CONDUCT ABSENCE OF CONDUCT IN THIS INCIDENT DIDN'T POSE A THREAT WELL THEN YOU'RE NOT ELIGIBLE. IN THEIR DETERMINATION IF IT WAS A THREAT THEN IT'S SIMPLY NOT GOING TO BE A VENUE OR NOT JUDY TO PURSUE. BUT WE HAVE TO BE RON REALISTIC HERE THAT WE DON'T WANT TO IN SUPPORT THIS IS IN NO WAY MEANS BY NO MEANS ENCOURAGES WILLFUL. OR CRIMINAL CONDUCT THAT'S OFF THE TABLE AND IT DOES ALSO IS SERIOUS HEALTH SAFETY OR ENVIRONMENTAL THREATS BUT I GO BACK TO THE ONE EXAMPLE I MENTIONED EARLIER IN ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND. THAT I'VE THAT I'VE HEARD OF IN IN DURING THE PANDEMIC OF INDIVIDUALS TRYING TO DO THE RIGHT THING WANT TO DO THE RIGHT THING WILL TAKE CORRECTIVE ACTION AFTER POINTED OUT. BY TO ASSESS THE MAXIMUM PENALTY WITHOUT A MECHANISM. BY AT ANY LEVEL THAT ALLOWS THEM FOR THOSE CONSIDERATIONS TO BE PART OF THE PROCESS IS IT WILL FUNDAMENTALLY UNFAIR AND I BELIEVE THAT IF YOU REACH OUT INTO THE COMMUNITIES THOSE COMMUNITIES WANT TO DO THE RIGHT THING BECAUSE THERE'S NOTHING IN THIS BILL. THAT MANDATES THE STATE MUST REDUCE THE PENALTY ACTUALLY NOTHING THAT'S WHERE I THINK THERE'S A BIT OF HANG UP WITH SOME OF THE FOLKS THAT HAVE CALLED IN. AND I'M GLAD WE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO CORRECT THEIR UNDERSTANDING. IS THAT THIS DOES NOT MANDATE A REDUCTION AT ALL. AT ALL. AND THERE'S ENOUGH SEEDS IN. FOR THE PRAC. PRACTICAL DESIRE OUTCOME TO BE ACHIEVED. THANK THINKING FOR ADDRESSING QUITE AT THE THIS PARTICULAR IMPORTANT WE ARE NOT UNDERMINE ITS EXISTING CODE AS WELL BUT- THANK THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU SENATOR PAN CENTER MEN. THANK YOU COMMITTEE CHAIR- CENTER BORDERS I REALLY APPRECIATE THE DIRECTIONALITY OF THIS BILL IT'S EXACTLY THE TYPE OF LEGISLATION WE NEED MORE OF. THE INCIDENT YOU DESCRIBED WITH THE RESTAURANT IN YOUR DISTRICT- MATCHES THE EXPERIENCES OF MANY SMALL BUSINESSES AROUND THE STATE- I DO HAVE SOME QUESTIONS JUST BECAUSE I MY MAIN CONCERN IS MAKING SURE WE'RE NOT CREATING A HUGE LOOPHOLE HERE- IN THE NAME OF. WHAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING IT CREATES HUGE PROBLEMS FOR. BUSINESSES THAT WILLFULLY OR INTENTIONALLY- OVERLOOKED THESE REGULATIONS IN WAYS THAT ARE CONTRARY TO PUBLIC POLICY AND SO I GUESS MY FIRST QUESTION IS REALLY TECHNICAL ONE FROM ONE LAW PROFESSOR TO ANOTHER- YOUR- LANGUAGE APPLIES TO VIOLATIONS. IT SAYS THE WAIVER WILL APPLY THE FOLLOWING CONDITIONS VIOLATION THAT DID NOT INVOLVE WILLFUL. IS A SERIOUS HEALTH SAFETY OR ENVIRONMENTAL THREAT INTEREST QUESTIONS I IS THAT BOTH OR ORIGIN OR- VISIT IN MANDARIN OR THERE BECAUSE I WASN'T ON CLEARING THE STATURE. THANK YOU FOR. THIS THIS REALLY IS GETTING INTO OUR- OUR ACADEMIC BACKGROUND I APPRECIATE THAT IT'S KIND OF LIKE THE OXFORD COMMA- MIGHT MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE WAY THAT LEDGE COUNCIL- DRAFTED THIS. IS THAT IT IS A SERIES OF ORDERS. OKAY THAT'S THAT'S SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT HE DOES NOT THEN THE THING THAT I GUESS WE'LL JUST POINT OUT YOU WOULD NOT NEED TO SHOW. WILL FOR SOMEBODY WOULD NOT NECESSARILY NEED WILL FOR CRIMINAL CONDUCT. ALTERNATIVELY IF THE VIOLATION DID NOT POSE A SERIOUS HEALTH SAFETY ENVIRONMENTAL THREAT EVEN IF IT WAS WILLFUL. IF THIS IS AN OR- THEY WOULD BE SUBJECT TO RELIEF AND ONE WHICH ARE ANDERSON YOUR QUESTION SO THE WAY THAT IT'S CRAFTED RIGHT NOW. WERE YOU REFERRING BONTA HEALTH COMMON SAFETY COMMON FOR ENVIRONMENTAL THREAT YES- SUBSET SECTION. B. SLASH ONE AND TWO. OR THAT IS- THE THOSE ARE SERIES ABOARD DOES BECAUSE THOSE COMMENTS ON THE ON THE SECOND HALF OF THE WAY IT'S WRITTEN IS YOUR ELECTION ON THE FIRST ARC CONDITION PRECEDENT YES I GUESS THE QUESTION IS JUST WITHOUT GETTING INTO CONDITION PRECEDENTS OR THINGS LIKE THAT- YOU'RE SAYING THIS POLICY OF RELIEF THAT IS TO SAY BUSINESS THAT VIOLATES A LAW OR REGULATION IS SUBJECT TO REDUCTION IN PENALTIES IF THEY MEET ONE OF THE FOLLOWING CRITERIA HI OTHER. THE VIOLATION DID NOT VIABLE FOR CRIMINAL CONDUCT OR THE VIOLATION DID NOT POSE A SERIOUS HEALTH SAFETY ENVIRONMENT IT'S ACTUALLY THE AND THE INVERSE IS WHAT WOULD ALLOW YOU TO BE ELIGIBLE TO BE. CONSIDERED I'M NOT A RIGHT. I'M I'M READING THE WAY OF THE I'M SORRY SO THE FALL SHALL BE. TO VIOLATE BY SMALL BUSINESS THAT MEETS THE FOLLOWING CRITERIA. SUBSECTIONONE THE VIOLATION DID NOT INVOLVE WILL FOR CRIMINAL CONDUCT. SUBSECTION TO THE VIOLATION DID NOT POSE A SERIOUS HEALTH SAFETY ENVIRONMENTAL THREAT IT DOES REDUCE QUALIFIERS FROM THE ABILITY FOR THE RESPECTIVE STATE. INSTRUMENT OR AGENCY. TO BEGIN REVIEWING THAT AND IF THEY IF THEY DETERMINE THAT INDEED SO I'M I'M JUST READING THE LANGUAGE RIGHT NOW BUT BUT IF YOU PUT AN ORDER IN THERE I'M JUST GONNA POINT OUT TO YOU. THAT YOU ARE THAT'S CONTRADICTORY TO WHAT YOU'RE CLAIMING ABOUT THE BILL BECAUSE- IF IT'S AN FOR IN THERE IT WHAT THIS SAYS IS THAT YOUR THE WAIVER POLICY APPLIES TO ANY BUSINESS. THAT MEETS THE FOLLOWING CRITERIA ONE THEY THEY DIDN'T DO THIS ON PURPOSE IT WASN'T WELL FOR CRIMINAL. TO THE VIOLATION DIDN'T POSE A SERIOUS HEALTH SAFETY OR PROVIDE REMOTE THREAT. I WOULD SUBMIT TO YOU IF IT'S A WAR. YOU'RE GONNA GET RID OF THE WILLFUL OR CRIMINAL AS LONG AS IT DID NOT POSE A SERIOUS HEALTH SAFETY OR ENVIRONMENTAL THREAT.  THINK YOU NEED AN END IN THERE TO MAKE IT THE WAY YOU WANT. AND I WOULD SUGGEST THAT AS A FRIENDLY AMENDMENT I'D WANT TO ADD THAT AND BECAUSE RIGHT NOW THE WAY IT'S WRITTEN IT'S JUST NOT CLEAR. YOU KNOW WHAT I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING- THAT THIS- THIS ATTENTION TO DETAIL ON TO THIS MATTER- I WOULD BE ABSOLUTELY. PLEASE VETERANS TEN I JUST ONE TO MAKE SURE THAT SALUTE AGAIN AS YOU KNOW. IN I CAN DO IS- AS THIS MOVES FORWARD SHOULD IT. HAS THIS COMMITTEE TO. WORK WITH YOU AND- CAL. TO MAKES THAT THE- IN. OR AND ALL THE- AND CAN BE LANGUAGE. IS ABSOLUTELY- AND I'M NOT TRYING TO PICK FOR THE DAY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE CAPTION YOU'RE NOT SETTLING. I GUESS THE OTHER QUESTION- YOU KNOW YOU YOU SAID A FEW TIMES THAT- IF YOU'RE NEGLIGENT. THEN YOU DON'T GET ANY RELIEF. BUT THE WAY I UNDERSTAND THE MECHANISMBY WHICH YOU'RE DOING THIS THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY RIGHT RIGHT THAT- THE OPERATIVE LANGUAGES THAT IS WILL FOR CRIMINAL CONDUCT RIGHT SO. THAT TAKES IT OFF THE TABLE IF IT'S WILL FOR CRIMINAL CONDUCT THEN YOU DON'T GET YOU'RE NOT SUBJECT TO RELIEF BUT IF IT'S NOT WILL FOR CRIMINAL. THEN YOU ARE ELIGIBLE FOR RELIEF UNDER THE POLICIES DEVELOP A DIFFERENT STATE AGENCIES. AND ONE OF THE MANY FACTORS THAT THEN GETS CONSIDERED IS WHETHER NEGLIGENT OR NOT. NOW MY CONCERN HEREIS YOU KNOW IF YOU LOOK TO THE OPPOSITION'S LANGUAGE THEIR CONCERN IS ONE I THINK A LOT OF A SHARE WHICH IS. THERE WILL BE BUSINESSES THAT ACTION VERY VERY BADLY AND IGNORE THI. AND AS YOU KNOW WILLFUL OR IF IT CRIMINALS VERY DIFFICULT TO PROVE IN ANY COURT SAID. AND I GUESS MY QUESTION IS WOULD YOU BE OPEN TO OR OR MAYBE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT THIS AND DISMISSED IT NINETY INTEREST IN YOUR REASONING- WHY NOT ADD GROSSLY NEGLIGENT OR WHY NOT DO SOMETHING LIKE NEGLIGENT AS A REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION BECAUSE- YOU KNOW NEGLIGENCE IS A LOT EASIER PROVE GROSS NEGLIGENCE IS HARD TO PROVE BUT IT'S EASIER PROVEN WILLFUL WHERE YOU JUST HAVE TO SHOW SOMEONE. ACTUALLY MEANT TO DO THIS AND THAT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO DO IN A COURT WITHOUT SOME KIND OF A SMOKING GUN. AND THAT MAKES THIS YOU KNOW ALMOST ALL BUSINESSES I THINK WOULD UNDER THIS LANGUAGE BE ELIGIBLE FOR THE POLICIES. AT WHICH POINT NEGLIGENCE WOULD THEN BE A FACTOR THAT COULD BE CONSIDERED SO I GUESS THEY THOUGHT MY QUESTION IS IF YOUR INTENTION WAS TO SAY. THAT NEGLIGENCE IF THE BUSINESS WAS JUST TOTALLY IGNORING ITS REGULATORY OBLIGATIONS THEY SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO DO THIS WHY NOT SORT OF PHRASES IN STRUCTURED THAT WAY AND ONCE AGAIN ON YOU BRING UP SOME- SOME IMPORTANT POINTS- YOUR LEGAL MIND IS GIVING YOU INSIGHT. INTO PARTICULARLY THAT I THINK IT'S HELPFUL THAT COULD MAKE THIS BETTER. AND I CAN EAT EASILY- REVISIT THIS AND WOULD EVEN ASK FOR YOUR ASSISTANCE AND IN DOING SO- TO FINE TUNE THIS. IN THAT THE BEST WAY POSSIBLE BECAUSE ONCE THE- THIS WILL NOT BE IS NOT IS. TO AND BY ITS BY THE- THAT- THAT WERE MORE FORWARD WITH ANY WITH. POTENTIAL AMENDMENTS IN THE COMING DAYS. IS NOT DESIGNED TO ALLOW FOR WILLFUL IGNORANCE. INTENTIONAL OVERSIGHTS. OR THOSE INDIVIDUALS THAT WANT TO SKIRT THE LAW. THAT'S NOT WHAT WE ARE ALLOWING THAT'S NOT WHAT WE WANT. WE JUST WANT TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT BUSINESSES- ARE GIVEN SOME EGREE OF- OF ALL VENUE THAT. DIVISIONS OF THE STATE HAVE A MECHANISM WITHIN THEIR OWN RESPECTIVE DEPARTMENTS TO EVALUATE THESE INSTANCES AND I MIGHT ALSO SAY THAT THE FACTORS OF THE STATE AGENCIES- SHOULD USE. IS ALSO IF AND TO WHAT EXTENT PENALTIES ARE EVEN ELIGIBLE RATE REDUCTIONS ARE ELIGIBLE IF. SOME OF THEM ARE NINE TWO TO BE ELIGIBLE AT ALL. THAT'S OKAY IF THE VIOLATIONS OR THAT TYPE OF DANGER BASED ON THE PERSON'S MOST KNOWLEDGEABLE IN THAT SPECIFIC INDUSTRY- WITHIN THIS THAT THE STATE AGENCIES. THEN THEY DON'T DESERVE THE REDUCTION AT ALL IT'S NOT A RIGHT IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY IF I AND I APPRECIATE THAT A SENATOR I THINK- YOU KNOW THIS SOUNDS LIKE A VERY ACADEMIC TECHNICAL CONVERSATION BUT- IT'S OBVIOUSLY VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE DIFFERENCE. FOR AVERAGE PEOPLE WORKERS SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS. IS GOING TO BE IMPORTANT- AND AGAIN I JUST EMPHASIZE WILL FOR CRIMINAL IS GOING TO BE VERY DIFFICULT TO PROVE FOR MOST WORKPLACE VIOLATIONS- IF YOU'RE OPEN TO AMENDING THAT IN WAYS THAT WOULD TRY TO OUR NARROWLY TAILOR THIS I WOULD BE- WILD ABOUT SUPPORTING THIS AND POTENTIALLY COOPERATING- AND TODAY I WILL SUPPORT THE BILL. AND GIVEN A DIMINISH YOU SUGGEST IF YOU'RE OPEN TO AND- THANK YOU VERY MUCH AS LONG AS YOU DON'T CHARGE MEAN HOURLY RATE PROFESSOR I WILL ABSOLUTELY. WORK WITH YOU HIS MUCH IS POSSIBLE. AT THIS. THANK YOU MISTER. OKAY SENATOR BATES. THANK YOU- MISTER CHAIRMAN AND THANK YOU TO THE GOOD SENATOR FROM IRVINE WORKING THROUGH THAT I HAD A FEW COMMENTS AND I'M NOT A LAWYER BUT I THINK THAT HE GOT TO THE POINT OF THAT I THINK IS IMPORTANT AND THAT NEEDS TO HAVE A DEEPER DIVE BUT I UNDERSTAND WE HAVE A CAUCUS OF THAT HAS BEEN DEVELOPED IN OUR LEGISLATURE SINCE WE HIT THE PANDEMIC IN MANY BUMPS IN THE ROAD FOR MANY OF OUR SMALL BUSINESSES HIS CALL THE OF SOLUTION CAUCUS. AND THIS TO ME WOULD BE- BILL THAT SHOULD BE ON THE TOP OF THEIR AGENDA BECAUSE IT. SETS FORTH I THINK OF THE PLANET WHERE WE CAN TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT OUR BUREAUCRACIES. AND HAVE. IN THIS PANDEMIC THAT HAVE. FALLEN UPON OUR SMALL BUSINESSES WHICH ARE AS WE KNOW THE ECONOMIC ENGINE OF THE NATION. SO I AM PREPARED TO- MOVE THE BILL TO SUPPORT THE BILL. AND- REALLY COLD BONTA TO SENATORS GET TOGETHER. REFINANCE AND MAYBE THIS IS OUR FIRST OF STEP. OUT TAKING A LOOK AT OUR BUREAUCRACIES THAT SEEM TO HAVE MORE- LET'S SAY A FORTY OVER THE LEGISLATURE ITSELF AND I'VE RAISED THIS ISSUE MANY TIMES SO WHEN WE LOOK AT AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT BOARD. WHEN WE LOOK AT THE COASTAL COMMISSION NOW ALL OF THE BUREAUCRACIES ARE ESTABLISHED SEEM TO REACH BEYOND MAYBE WHAT THE INTENT OF SOME OF OUR LEGISLATION IS BEYOND. FROM BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE ATTEMPTING TO DO OUR BEST JOBS ARE VERY BEST JOB FOR THE CONSTITUENCIES THAT WE SERVE. SO AGAIN THANK YOU FOR THE GREAT DISCUSSION. A HANDGUN AGAIN I MOVE THE BILL. THANK YOU SURVEYS- ANY OTHER COMMENTS COLLEAGUES- CENTER PENA COMING BACK TO THE WELLS OKAY SORRY I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY EGGMAN HERE FROM THE AUTHOR ARE YOU COMMITTING TO INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE IN THE FUTURE AMENDMENT TO THIS BILL I. IN THAT DIALOGUE WITH CENTER MINOR YOU'RE NOT SURE I HEARD THAT EXCITE CONFIRM THAT YOU ARE GOING TO INCLUDE NEGLIGENCE AS A SO YEAH I'M I'M I'M FINE WITH BUSINESSES THAT ACT IN GOOD FAITH AND YOU KNOW MAYBE THEY MISSED SOMETHING BUT SOMEONE WHO'S JUST NEGLIGENT ISN'T EVEN TRYING TO COMPLY WITH THE REGULATION THAT'S A LITTLE DIFFERENT TO ME SO CAN YOU JUST PLEASE VERIFY THAT YOU'RE COMMITTING TO COMMIT TO INCLUDE NEGLIGENCE THIS. IS A ISSUE. IN IN YOUR BILL IN THE FUTURE. I'M AB- GONNA CHU WITH THE WITH WE WITH THE CENTER AND LUNCH COUNCIL I BELIEVE THAT'S PROBABLY WHERE WE'RE GOING TO. WE'RE PROBABLY GOING TO PUT IT IN. BUT I WOULD I DON'T LIKE TELLING WHAT YOU'RE A COMMITMENT THAT YOU INTEND TO PUT NEGLIGENCE AND- THAT THE I HEAR YOU SAID TALKING ALLEGE COUNCIL BUT YOU YOURSELF YOU'RE YOU COMMITTING. I MEAN I'M NOT A LAWYER SO IJUST WANT YOU KNOW I HEALTH I'LL TAKE YOUR WORD FOR IT. JUST TELL ME THAT YOU PLAN TO INCLUDE NEGLIGENCE IS ONE OF THE TRIGGERS. FOR THIS BILL. I AM PLANNING ON INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE ON AFTER CONSULTATION WITH VILLAGE COUNCIL AND- THE DIVIDING THE WORD THAT YOU DON'T PUT THAT IN THERE. LET'S LET'S NOT FORGET. THE LANGUAGE THANK YOU. RIGHT MUCH. SENATE THANK YOU MISTER SO OPTION TENNESSEE PUT WELL SHE UP I HAVE A SIMILAR ON MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T CREATE LED THE JUSTICE NECK TO INTENSE ON INTO- AND SO. BUT I WILL AGREE WITH THE AUTHOR EDITOR RESPECT WE TRYING TO DO THIS IS A VERY CHALLENGING STATE. TO DO BUSINESS. BUT IT'S ALSO TRUE THAT- YOU KNOW IGNORANCE OF THE LAW IS NOT AN EXCUSE- IN SO MANY OF THESE REGULATIONS ARE CARD OR DULY IN PLACE TO ENSURE THAT BUSINESSES NOW TO COMPLY WITH THE LAW BUT EDUCATE THEMSELVES AS TO THE LAW. AND SO YOU KNOW I WOULD ECHO THE CONCERNS CENTER COMMUNITY MOVE FORWARD TO MAKE SURE THAT- THAT IS RENDERED CLIPS. THANK YOU OF. BONO CENTER MEN I JUST HAD A QUICK CLARIFYING- COMMENT AND WITH ALL RESPECT TO MY COLLEAGUES IN FULLERTON- SOMETIMES IGNORANCE AS AN EXCUSE FOR THE FOR BREAKING THE LAW IT DEPENDS ON THE LEVELS OF INTENT AND REQUIRED SO I WOULD ONLY SAY THAT YOU KNOW IT NOT NOT TO SOUND LIKE A LAWYER BUT ONE OF THINGS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE IS WE'RE MAKING THE LAW. IN SOMTIMES LIKE IGNORANCE YOU KNOW WILLFUL IGNORANCE I THINK NO ONE EXCUSE BUT SOMETIMES IF IT'S A YOU KNOW A GOOD FAITH IGNORANCE THERE ARE INSTANCES WHERE WE MIGHT ONE EXCUSE THAT. I THINK I'VE SEEN NO FURTHER MIKE SIERRA- CENTER GORGEOUS YOU DID NOT KNOW THAT WE HAD A JUDICIARY TO THE NAME OF THE COMMITTEE BUT HERE WE ARE. I JUST HAVE A JUST A QUICK COMMENT- YOU KNOW OSHA WORKERS COMP OF READY OF OTHER AGENCIES IN THE STATE ALREADY INCLUDE PROVISIONS FOR REDUCTION IN PENALTIES AND CITATIONS FOR SMALL EMPLOYERS WITH MITIGATING FACTORS IN HIS EYES I READ WHAT I READ- ICE I THINK THAT IS YOUR IDEA HERE TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT. FOR SMALL EMPLOYERS MITIGATING FACTORS AND MAKE SURE THAT THE AGENCY OR THE DEPARTMENT HAS PROCEDURES OR POLICIES IN PLACE TO ACCOUNT FOR THOSE MITIGATING FACTORS WHEN SETTING. FINES AND PENALTIES IS THAT CORRECT ABSOLUTELY CORRECT IN IT THOSE IF THOSE DIVISIONS OF THE STATE ALREADY HAVE FOR THOSE PROVISIONS THAT ACCOUNT FOR MITIGATING MEASURES- THEN. THAT SATISFIES THE INTENT FOR THAT PARTICULAR DIVISION OF THE STATE CAN YOU MAY SO YOU I DIDN'T RELOCATE THE BILL BUT YOU MAY NEED TO TAKE ANOTHER LOOK AT YOUR BILL ON THAT PARTICULAR POINT TO MAKE SURE THAT. BUT TO THE EXTENT IT'S NOT THAT IT'S CRYSTAL CLEAR. THIS OBVIOUSLY SOUNDS LIKE A WORK IN PROGRESS SO LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING IT- AT SOME LATER DATE I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL- TODAY AND LOOK FORWARD TO FURTHER PROGRESS WITH RESPECT TO THE LANGUAGE THANK YOU- CENTER BURGESS WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU FOR CALLING US FOR THE SPIRITED DEBATE- THIS IS HOW LEGISLATION IS MADE BETTER.

SHOCKER FOR ALL THE WORK THAT THEY'VE DONE ON. THE DEVASTATING VISIT CALIFORNIA. THESE FEES WOULD REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT COST TO SMALL BUSINESSES PARTICULARLY AS THEIR INCOMESHAVE BEEN CUT SHORT BY THE EMERGENCY- THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET ALLOWS FEES.

WHO ARE FORCED TO SHUTTER THEIR OPERATIONS IN RESPONSE TO THE PANDEMIC- WHAT YOU MAY OR MAY NOT KNOW IS THAT CALIFORNIA RESTAURANTS AND OUR OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN DICTATED BY THE STATE CERTAINLY. BUT SIXTY ONE DIFFERENT LOCAL JURISDICTIONS THAT DICTATE. HOW WE CAN OPERATE AND AT WHAT LEVEL AND FOR MOST OF THE LAST YEAR- INDOOR DINING IS BEEN PROHIBITED AND IT LARGELY STILL IS PROHIBITED AND MUCH OF THE STATE SO. THIS BILL REPRESENTS A MEASURE OF FAIRNESS AND JUST GOOD GOVERNMENT- THE BILL. LINES WITH PROTECTING PUBLIC HEALTH.

BUT YOU SURE NO ONE IS SIGNALED THAT THEY WISH TO SPEAK THANK YOU MR MODERATOR WE WILL NOW BRING THE DISCUSSION BACK TO MY COLLEAGUES HERE IN THE SENATE CHAMBER COLLEAGUES ANY QUESTIONS. DR PAN FIRST UP AGAIN. THANK YOU SIR CHAIR- ND THE THIRD QUESTION FOR THE AUTHOR AGAIN TO SHOOT THE BILL JUST TO CLARIFY- SO- WHAT IS THE SIZE OF THE CREDIT SO FOR EXAMPLE ON CYSTIC IN MY INFECTION- THIS IS CORRECT APPLY DIRECTLY TO ME BUT A PHYSICIAN'S PRACTICE HAD TO CLOSE FOR. SAY SIX WEEKS TWO MONTHS BECAUSE OF STAY AT HOME ORDER- DEPOSITION HAS A MEDICAL LICENSE. DID THEY GET CREDIT FOR THEIR MEDICAL LICENSE FEE- AND THEN I'LL GIVE ANOTHER EXAMPLE SO YOU CAN JUST TACKLE THEM ALL TIMES- YOU HAVE A BUSINESS AS A BUSINESS LICENSE FROM THEIR CITY- THEY HAD TO CLOSE FOR A PERIOD OF TIME- THEY MAY HAVE TO CLOSE THE WHOLE YEAR BEFORE PORTION OF TIME. DOES THIS IS THIS YOU GET CREDIT FOR YOUR BUSINESS LICENSE- FOR THE CITY AND THEN IS THAT BECOME A STATE MANDATE THAT THEREFORE WE IS THE STATE HAVE TO REIMBURSE THE CITY FOR SO. MANY TWO EXAMPLES THAT- YOU CAN PERHAPS. CLARIFY HOW THIS CREDIT WOULD WORK- THE- FIRST QUESTION IS- IF YOU'RE NOT ABLE TO PRACTICE. THEN YOU WOULD GET. SOME OR ALL OF YOUR LICENSE FEE THAT WOULD BE. PROVIDED A TAX CREDIT THE FOLLOWING YEAR- WITH RESPECT TO BUSINESS LICENSE YES IT WOULD BE A STATE MANDATED AND TO THE EXTENT THAT THE CITY HAD NOT BEEN PAID OR WHATEVER- AUTHORIZING INSTITUTION- YES IT WOULD. AND IT IN TERMS OF OTHER. FOR EXAMPLE FEES IF YOU HAD SOME SORT OF A- A FEE FOR. NON INSPECTION- CONCERNING CHEMICALS AND THAT KIND OF THING SAME THING THERE YES THE WHOLE PURPOSE IS TO MAKE SURE THAT. YOU'RE NOT OPERATIONAL YOU'RE NOT PAYING. THE STATE FEES. THAT ONE WOULD NORMALLY PAY IF YOU ARE. AFFECTED AND JUST AGAIN FURTHER CLARIFY- SO IF YOUR CLOTHES FOR THE DAY PORTION OF THE YEAR BECAUSE- YOU KNOW THINGS ARE- PEOPLE COME. RESUMES OF IT IS IT IS THE CREDIT AN ALLERGY TO FIND THIS IS THE CREDIT AMOUNT THE I GUESS THE PRO RATED SHARE OF THE YEAR BECAUSE MEDICAL LICENSES A TO YOU EVERY TWO YEARS- BUSINESS. LICENSE AT LEAST FOR TO SEE SACRAMENTO'S ANNUAL SELLS YOUR CLOTHES FOR LET'S SAY TWO MONTHS TO USE THE CREDIT FOR THAT PRO REDUCED. AMOUNT OF THAT FEE FOR THE TIME YOUR CLOTHES OR DO YOU JUST EXPLAIN MAYBE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW THE MECHANISM WORKS FOR THIS TAX CREDIT YOU WOULD PLAY FOR THE TAX CREDIT THEN YOU WOULD CLAIM. BUT CERTAIN TAX CREDIT ON A PRO RATED BASIS SO. BEFORE YOU FILE YOUR. TAXES DOCTOR PANEL BE HAPPY TO HELP. MMHM THANKS VERY MUCH A SEPARATE THANK YOU CENTERMAN. THANK YOU I JUST TO THANK MY COLLEAGUE FOR INTRODUCING THIS BILL AND JUST WANT TO AND FIXED THAT I'D LOVE TO THIS IN MY EARLY STEP TO. THANK YOU SEVEN. NEWMAN AS USUAL SO TANNER INTO SO IN THE ARE TO MY COURSE. THAT I VERY THE IS A VERY BILL I COMMEND YOU. AS TO I THINK MS SUTTON FOR THE- SAYS. THIRTY IT IS MUCH MORE. HAVE BEEN DEVON PARTICULAR INDUSTRY- I CHIU THE SAN COMMITTEE ON CONDEMNING MERGERS ARE NOW HEARING ACTUALLY BE. THE RESTAURANT INDUSTRY AND HOW IT'S BEEN IMPACTED SO I WOULD. RESPECTFULLY ASK AS WELL IF THIS BILLS AMENDED ID ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR AND MAKE USE. OF NEWMAN CENTER TO A BOOK. MISTER THANK VERY MUCH THE AUTHOR THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BRINGING THIS. BILL FORWARD AS SOMEONE WHO. WHOSE FATHER OWNED A COUPLE OF RESTAURANTS IN THE AREA IT IS VERY SYMPATHETIC TO THE- THE CONDITION OF MANY OF OUR RESTAURANTS IN THERE. AND WOULD BE HAPPY TO- IF YOU'RE ACCEPTING CALL OTHERS WOULD BE HAPPY TO GO OUT OF THIS BILL. THANK YOU SIR. WE'LL DO. THIRD WITH. TO BE CONTRARIAN SINCE EVERYBODY SAYING HOW WONDERFUL IT IS I WOULD JUST LIKE TO KNOW- I'M I'M NO FAN OF MEANS TESTING BUT THIS BILL DOESN'T SAY HOW BIG THE COMPANY HAS TO BE HOW MANY EMPLOYEES THEY HAVE TO HAVEHOW MANY- HOW LONG THEY WOULD HAVE HAD TO BE A CLOSE NONE OF THAT SO- IS THERE IS THERE ANY THOUGHT INTO THAT OR IS IT. COME ONE COME ALL IT WOULD BE PRO RATED BASED ON THE TIME THAT YOU WOULD BE CLOSE SO FOR EXAMPLE TO USE CENTER PANS- QUESTION IS THAT IF YOUR CLOTHES FOR THE ENTIRE YEAR THE TAX CREDIT THAT YOU WOULD APPLY FOR YOU WOULD CLEAN THE ENTIRE YEAR YOUR CLOTHES REPORT SHE'D ONLY CLAIM A PORTION OF IT- IT CURRENTLY THERE IS NO- DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE SIZE OF COMPANIES IT IS DIRECTED TOWARDS SMALL BUSINESSES- SMALL BUSINESSES FOR EXAMPLE A RESTAURANT WITH A LIQUOR LICENSE OR A LICENSE TO SELL LIQUOR. THAT COULD BE VERY EXPENSIVE PART OF THEIR OPERATING COSTS- QUERY WE CAN WE CAN LOOK AT IT IS TO IS TO OTHER BUSINESSES BUT IT IS GEARED TO FOCUS ON SMALL BUSINESSES IN. PARTICULAR RESTAURANTS AND BARS. CORRECT AND IT'S GETS GEARED TOWARDS. BUT DOESN'T OF IT IN JUST. IT IS NOT CURRENTLY TO OKAY THANKS SOME ONE LOOK THE- THANK. THANK YOU SAID EGGMAN.
