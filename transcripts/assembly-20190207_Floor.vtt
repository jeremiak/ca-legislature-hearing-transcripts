00:51:37.994 --> 00:51:39.329
TURN AROUND THAT WAS AMAZING IN

00:51:39.396 --> 00:51:40.730
SOUTH AFRICA.

00:51:40.797 --> 00:51:42.232
IN TERMS OF STOPPING THE

00:51:42.299 --> 00:51:44.701
INFECTIONS SAVING LIVES

00:51:44.768 --> 00:51:46.470
PREVENTING THE TRANSFERENCE OF

00:51:46.536 --> 00:51:47.704
TO THE DISEASE TO THE INFANTS

00:51:47.771 --> 00:51:49.306
BECAUSE OF LEARNING HOW TO

00:51:49.372 --> 00:51:51.475
DELIVER BABIES IN DIFFERENT WAYS.

00:51:51.541 --> 00:51:53.176
AND SO AS A RESULT WE SAW WHAT

00:51:53.243 --> 00:51:54.978
THE UNITED STATES CAN DO.

00:51:55.045 --> 00:51:56.646
WHEN HE PUTS HIS FOCUS ON?

00:51:56.713 --> 00:51:58.048
WE SAW WHAT IT'S DONE WHEN WHEN

00:51:58.114 --> 00:51:59.649
MAGIC JOHNSON TO ANNOUNCE THAT

00:51:59.716 --> 00:52:00.684
HE HAD AIDS.

00:52:00.750 --> 00:52:03.153
HOW THE FOCUS OF OF RESEARCH AND

00:52:03.220 --> 00:52:05.155
MEDICAL CARE AND EVERYTHING

00:52:05.222 --> 00:52:07.924
FOCUS SO THE NOW AS A SOCIETY?

00:52:07.991 --> 00:52:09.059
WE DON'T LIVE UNDER THE SHADOW

00:52:09.125 --> 00:52:10.427
OF AIDS AND SOME OF YOU OLD

00:52:10.494 --> 00:52:11.761
ENOUGH TO REMEMBER HOW HORRIBLE

00:52:11.828 --> 00:52:13.797
IT WAS WHAT I FEARED WAS BECAUSE

00:52:13.864 --> 00:52:16.333
IT TRULY WAS A DEFINITE

00:52:16.399 --> 00:52:17.934
STATEMENT THAT YOU GOT IT.

00:52:18.001 --> 00:52:18.835
WHAT THIS SAYS TO ME VERY

00:52:18.902 --> 00:52:20.237
CLEARLY THAT WOULD WANT ADMIN

00:52:20.303 --> 00:52:21.404
SAID ABOUT EDUCATION?

00:52:21.471 --> 00:52:22.038
THAT WE KNOW EVERYTHING WE NEED

00:52:22.105 --> 00:52:25.108
TO KNOW A OBJECT.

00:52:25.175 --> 00:52:27.511
WHAT WE LACK IS THE WILL?

00:52:27.577 --> 00:52:29.479
WE LACK THE WILL.

00:52:29.546 --> 00:52:31.081
AND IT IS SHAMEFUL THAT IN THIS

00:52:31.147 --> 00:52:32.616
COUNTRY AT THIS TIME.

00:52:32.682 --> 00:52:35.252
AFRICAN AMERICAN MEN AND WOMEN.

00:52:35.318 --> 00:52:37.087
ARE STILL BEING DIAGNOSED AT A

00:52:37.153 --> 00:52:39.122
HIGHER RATE THAN ANY OTHER GROUP.

00:52:39.189 --> 00:52:40.657
AND IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH DO

00:52:40.724 --> 00:52:42.926
WE HAVE THE MONEY IT HAS NOTHING

00:52:42.993 --> 00:52:43.493
TO DO WOULD DO WE HAVE THE

00:52:43.560 --> 00:52:44.528
KNOWLEDGE.

00:52:44.594 --> 00:52:46.162
DO WE HAVE THE CARE WILL BE

00:52:46.229 --> 00:52:47.130
SHOULD HAVE THE PASSION AND

00:52:47.197 --> 00:52:48.265
COULD AND CARE.

00:52:48.331 --> 00:52:50.333
FOR BUT IT LACKS THE WILL.

00:52:50.400 --> 00:52:50.901
AND MANY OF THESE FOLKS ARE

00:52:50.967 --> 00:52:52.669
SHAMED THEY REMIND ME OF WHAT I

00:52:52.736 --> 00:52:55.105
WOULD TO GOD TO TAKE MONEY. TO

00:52:55.171 --> 00:52:56.773
AN AIDS PROJECT I HAD TO MEET

00:52:56.840 --> 00:52:58.308
THEM IN A BACK ROOM AT AT THE

00:52:58.375 --> 00:52:59.843
PEACE CORPS BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T

00:52:59.910 --> 00:53:01.811
WANT ANYBODY TO SEE THEM GETTING

00:53:01.878 --> 00:53:02.946
THIS MONEY.

00:53:03.013 --> 00:53:04.014
BECAUSE THEY THEY WERE SO

00:53:04.080 --> 00:53:05.582
ASHAMED IN THE VILLAGES THEY

00:53:05.649 --> 00:53:07.117
KNEW THAT IF SOMEBODY TO THEY

00:53:07.183 --> 00:53:08.385
HAD AIDS TO BE OSTRACIZED.

00:53:08.451 --> 00:53:09.953
THAT STILL EXISTS TODAY IN

00:53:10.020 --> 00:53:12.122
AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITIES

00:53:12.188 --> 00:53:13.390
ACROSS THE NATION.

00:53:13.456 --> 00:53:15.559
WE HAVE TO PUT A FOCUS ON THIS.

00:53:15.625 --> 00:53:17.427
THIS IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE I

00:53:17.494 --> 00:53:18.495
WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUE FOR

AND SO WHAT MAY SEEM.

00:54:30.266 --> 00:54:32.135
UNNECESSARY TO TALK ABOUT THIS

00:54:32.202 --> 00:54:33.770
ISSUE WE KNOW --

00:54:33.837 --> 00:54:34.604
THAT THE AFRICAN AMERICAN HE

00:54:51.721 --> 00:54:53.123

OBVIOUSLY I KNOW A LOT OF FOLKS

00:54:54.624 --> 00:54:56.726
WHO HAVE DEALT WITH THIS DISEASE.

00:54:56.793 --> 00:54:58.361
FOLKS WHO'D NOW OUR LIVING OF

00:54:58.428 --> 00:54:59.262
QUITE HEALTHFULLY OTHER FOLKS

00:54:59.329 --> 00:55:00.163
THAT ARE PROTECTED BECAUSE THE

00:55:00.230 --> 00:55:01.231
RESEARCH THAT QUITE FRANKLY

00:55:01.297 --> 00:55:02.065
COMES OUT OF MY ASSEMBLY

00:55:02.132 --> 00:55:03.299
DISTRICT --

00:55:03.366 --> 00:55:04.167
THE WORLD THE NEW DATE IT'S A

00:55:04.234 --> 00:55:05.568
NEW WORLD WHEN IT COMES HIV

00:55:05.635 --> 00:55:07.470
INFECTIONS AND YET THAT HAS NOT

00:55:07.537 --> 00:55:09.105
PENETRATED EVERY COMMUNITY AND

00:55:09.172 --> 00:55:11.174
WE LOOK AT NEW INFECTION RATES

00:55:11.241 --> 00:55:12.175
ACROSS THIS COUNTRY WE

00:55:12.242 --> 00:55:13.176
UNDERSTAND IT SEE THEM FALLING

00:55:13.243 --> 00:55:14.444
IN CERTAIN COMMUNITIES.

00:55:14.511 --> 00:55:15.745
AND YET CONTINUE PERSISTENTLY

00:55:15.812 --> 00:55:18.548
HIGH IN OTHER IN THE AFRICAN

00:55:18.615 --> 00:55:20.383
AMERICAN COMMUNITY IS ALSO TRUE

00:55:20.450 --> 00:55:21.718
IN THE LATINO COMMUNITY AND

00:55:21.785 --> 00:55:23.086
COURSE NOW JUDY COMMUNITY THIS

00:55:23.153 --> 00:55:24.754
CONTINUES TO BE A FUN OF MY

00:55:24.821 --> 00:55:25.722
CONCERN.

00:55:25.789 --> 00:55:27.357
SO OF MEMBERS EITHER THIS

00:55:27.424 --> 00:55:28.391
RESOLUTION DOES HAVE POWER

00:55:28.458 --> 00:55:29.993
BECAUSE WE HAVE A SITUATION

00:55:30.060 --> 00:55:30.560
WHERE PEOPLE STILL STAND IN

00:55:30.627 --> 00:55:33.263
SILENCE AND ARE NOT INFORMED OF

00:55:33.329 --> 00:55:34.364
MEDICATIONS THAT ARE AVAILABLE

00:55:34.431 --> 00:55:35.699
THE COULD PREVENT INFECTIONS.

00:55:35.765 --> 00:55:36.966
MEDICATIONS THAT COULD EXTEND

00:55:37.033 --> 00:55:38.535
AND IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LIFE

00:55:38.601 --> 00:55:39.803
WHEN WE KNOW THAT FOLKS WILL NOT

00:55:39.869 --> 00:55:41.137
STEP OUT OF THE CLOSET BECAUSE

00:55:41.204 --> 00:55:42.205
IT'S TOO HARD IN THAT MAY

00:55:42.272 --> 00:55:43.106
ACTUALLY CAN SIGN INTO A

00:55:43.173 --> 00:55:45.442
SITUATION WHERE THEY EVEN HIGHLY

00:55:45.508 --> 00:55:46.976
MORE VULNERABLE TO IN HIV

00:55:47.043 --> 00:55:47.577
INFECTION.

00:55:47.644 --> 00:55:49.079
THEN WE MUST VOTE WE MUST BRING

00:55:49.145 --> 00:55:50.480
UP THIS RESOLUTION WE MUST TALK

00:55:50.547 --> 00:55:52.282
ABOUT THIS BECAUSE THESE WORDS

00:55:52.348 --> 00:55:53.883
ARE AND FACT POWERFUL AND THEY

00:55:53.950 --> 00:55:55.318
PENETRATE INTO OUR COMMUNITIES

00:55:55.385 --> 00:55:56.386
AND THEY MAY PREVENT AN

00:55:56.453 --> 00:55:57.987
INFECTION THEY MAY GET SOMEONE

00:55:58.054 --> 00:55:58.822
TO GET INTO.

00:55:58.888 --> 00:56:00.290
CARE AND PREVENT THEIR ABILITY

00:56:00.356 --> 00:56:01.458
TO SPREAD THE DISEASE IT MAY

00:56:01.524 --> 00:56:02.692
ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO SAVE A LIFE

00:56:02.759 --> 00:56:04.728
SO I THINK THIS IS VERY POWERFUL

00:56:04.794 --> 00:56:06.062
I THINK THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT I

00:56:06.129 --> 00:56:07.497
THINK MY COLLEAGUE FROM CARSON.

00:56:07.564 --> 00:56:08.698
BUT NOT TO SHARE HIS PERSONAL

00:56:08.765 --> 00:56:10.266
EXPERIENCES BEFORE BRINGING THIS

00:56:10.333 --> 00:56:11.801
RESOLUTION BEFORE US.

00:56:11.868 --> 00:56:14.204
WE HAVE COME A LONG WAY BEFORE

00:56:14.270 --> 00:56:15.071
TOO MANY COMMUNITIES IN A

00:56:15.138 --> 00:56:15.605

IT IS MEDICALLY IN TECHNICALLY

00:56:42.165 --> 00:56:44.601

01:20:23.418 --> 01:20:25.086
EXTENSION OF JUSTICE FOR THESE

01:20:25.153 --> 01:20:26.755
INDIVIDUALS WERE WAITING FOR

01:20:26.821 --> 01:20:27.989
THEIR CASES.

01:20:28.056 --> 01:20:29.291

STATE OF CALIFORNIA BECAUSE OF

HER SENSITIVITY TO THAT ISSUE.

01:20:33.662 --> 01:20:34.563
SHE CARED DEEPLY ABOUT YOUNG

01:20:34.629 --> 01:20:36.398

01:20:43.171 --> 01:20:47.442
THE SENSITIZER COURT TO THE CHAT

01:20:47.509 --> 01:20:48.777

01:20:48.843 --> 01:20:50.512
SOME SOME SENSE OF COMPASSION

01:20:50.579 --> 01:20:51.246
FOR THEM.

01:20:51.313 --> 01:20:52.681
SHE WAS A CHAMPION AND

01:20:52.747 --> 01:20:53.815
EVERYTHING THAT WE TALKED ABOUT

01:20:53.882 --> 01:20:55.650

THEY UNDERSTOOD THEIR

01:20:58.520 --> 01:21:00.088
RELATIONSHIP WITH OTHERS AND WHY

01:21:00.155 --> 01:21:01.389
THEY NEED TO BE HEALTHY.

01:21:01.456 --> 01:21:02.424

01:21:02.490 --> 01:21:04.359
FIRST TEACHER OF CHILDREN TO

01:21:04.426 --> 01:21:05.827

THEY REVIEW THEIR SISTER BECAUSE

01:21:12.434 --> 01:21:14.069
SHE WAS SUCH AN ADVOCATE.

01:21:14.135 --> 01:21:15.270

THAT SHE NEEDED TO GO IN A

01:21:23.678 --> 01:21:24.512
DIFFERENT DIRECTION THAN
