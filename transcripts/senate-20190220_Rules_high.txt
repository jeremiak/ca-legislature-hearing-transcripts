I SEE MY PRIORITIES AS WORKING ACROSS OUR MANY PROGRAMS TO BETTER MEET THE NEEDS OF OUR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS AND THE COMMUNITIES THEY SERVE. PARTICULARLY DURING EMERGENCIES SUCH AS WILD BY FIRES AND OTHER INFECTIOUS DISEASES. TO ALIGN THOSE PROGRAMS AROUND A SINGLE ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE AND CENTER SHARED PRIORITIES AND FINALLY TO ENSURE THAT THE DEPARTMENTS BURKE IS INFORMED BY OPEN COMMUNICATION.

THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO DATE -- YOU HAD AN OPPORTUNITY WE HADAN OPPORTUNITY TO MEET YESTERDAY IN YOU ADDRESS A LOT OF MY QUESTIONS I CAN ASK A FEW TODAY JUST FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE COMMITTEE. AND THOSE THAT MIGHT BE LISTENING IN ONE OF THE AREAS THAT YOU HAVE OVERSIGHT OUR INSPECTIONS FOR LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES. IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA AND OTHERS A BACKLOG OF INVESTIGATION OF COMPLAINTS. I KNOW IT'S BEEN OF CONCERN TO MANY MANY YOU GIPSON UPDATE ON THE PATHWAY TO CLEARING SOME OF THAT BACKLOG OF COMPLAINTS. SO RIGHT NOW THERE ARE IS A BACKLOG OF ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND COMPLAINTS IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY FOR THE FACILITIES THAT ARE LOCATED ANDLA COUNTY. I'M AND WE ARE WORKING DILIGENTLY TO ADDRESS THOSE WE'VE BEEN NEGOTIATING A NEW CONTRACT WITH LA COUNTY TO PROVIDE THEM WITH THE RESOURCES THEY NEED TO TAKEON A 100% OF THE WORK FOR THE HEALTH CARE FACILITY LOCATED IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY. AND WE LAST YESTERDAY WE GOT A SETTLEMENT ON THE FINAL ISSUE WE I WAS WORKING ON WITH LOS ANGELES COUNTY -- AND SO THEY WILL BE RAMPING OFF THEIR STAFF OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE THE RESOURCES THEY NEED TO ADDRESS THOSE COMPLAINTS. IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT WE DEAL WITH THE MOST EGREGIOUS COMPLAINTS VERY QUICKLY SOME OF THESE COMPLAINTS ARE NOT IN THE MINOR LESS LESS IMPORTANT OR NOT IMPORTANT BUT LAST AND AGREE JUST COMPLAINTS AND SO WHAT WE'LL BE DOING. OVER THE NEXT COUPLE YEARS WITH LA COUNTY IS AS THEY GET A NEW COMPLAINT IN THE FACILITY THEY'LL BE LOOKING UP THE OTHER COMPLAINTS THAT ARE IN THAT FACILITY AND SORT OF GETTING AN ECONOMY OF SCALE SO WHEN YOU GO INTO A FACILITY. YOU NOT ONLY DEAL WITH THE COMPLAINT THAT'S NEW ON BUT YOU ALSO LOOK AT THE OTHER COMPLAINTS THAT MAYBE FOR THAT SAME FACILITY AND THEREBY WE CAN DECREASE THE BACKLOG A LITTLE BIT QUICKER. IN SO THE LA COUNTY WORKS ON TRACTORS I ASSUME CERTAIN. PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS ARE TARGETS WOULD YES SO WE WE ARE WITH THE BACKLOG. YES AND SO AND IN THEIR CONTRACT WE HAVE A SERIES OF WORKLOAD METRICS QUALITY MACK TRUCKS AND AND CUSTOMER SERVICE METRICS AND SO. PART OF THAT CONTRACT IS TO NOT ONLY DEAL WITH THE NEW COMPLAINTS WITHIN THE NEW TIME LINE WHICH IS A SIXTY DAY TIMELINE FOR NEW COMPLAINTS COMING IN BUT OVER THAT OVER A THREE YEAR PERIOD TO REDUCE THE BACKLOG OF THOSE COMPLAINTS AS WELL. IN AGAIN WHEN YOU WERE MINE THE COMMITTEE. IF IF A COMPLAINT IS RECEIVED. THAT REPRESENTS A THREAT TO LIFE FOR SAFETY HOW IS THAT HANDS THAT WE PRIORITIZE THOSE AND WE'RE USUALLY IN A FACILITY WITHIN A COUPLE OF DAYS TO LOOK AT THEM -- THOSE IMMEDIATE JEOPARDY KINDS OF A BOUNCE. IN WOULD THERE BE A CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE IT WOULD REQUIRE GETTING THEIR EVEN. MORE QUICKLY THAN EXCEPT SOMETIMES WILL EVEN GO IN ON A WEEKEND OR AT NIGHT HOME DEPENDING ON HOW AGREE JUST THAT. ISSUE AS AND IF WE WERE ARE WORRIED WILL GO IN THERE MEDIA ONLY. THANK YOU AND THEN I KNOW -- OVER THE YEARS AND DURING SOME OF OUR BUDGET CHALLENGES IN THE PAST. THE FIELD HOSPITALS THE MOBILE FIELD CALIFORNIA HAD OPERATED AND I THINK PART OF THAT IS UNDER YOUR PURVIEW UNDER THE EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS OFFICE. COULD YOU SHARE WITH US WHAT THE STATUS IS OF THOSE EMERGENCY FIELD HOSPITALS SO WE WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH OUR COLLEAGUES Ã¡P EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES FOR A PARTY AND WE RUN A JOINT OPERATION CENTER TOGETHER. AND THE MOBILE FIELD OFF HOSPITALS ARE NOW -- ON THEIR UNDER I'M SAYS JURISDICTION AND WHAT THEY HAVE DONE IS TO PUT THEM OUT IN THE FIELD SO THAT WE BROKEN UP WHAT WERE ONCE LARGE MOBILE FIELD HOSPITALS AS WE LOST FUNDING. AND PUT THEM IN THE SIX MUTILATED REGIONS WITHIN SOME OF OUR COUNTIES AND WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO USE THEM DURING THE WILD FIRES AS SORT OF A MEDICAL SHELTERS AND SO IN LOVE MOST RECENT BUTTE COUNTY FIRES WERE ABLE TO SET SOME OF THOSE TENTS UP IN ORDER. TO ISOLATE THOSE WHO BECOME ILL AND TREAT THEM -- OUTSIDE OF THE GENERAL POPULATION SHELTERS AND SO I THINK IT'S BEEN A A GOOD SUCCESS STORY THERE WERE. MORE CLOSELY -- LOCATED IN EACH OF THAT -- MUTUAL AID REGION SO WE CAN GET THERE QUICKER. THANK YOU THAT'S REASSURING I'M SORRY WE'RE NEEDING TO DEPLOY THEM BUT IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THEY ARE AVAILABLE -- I THINK MY FINAL AREA OF QUESTIONING YOU HAVE OVERSIGHT OVER MULTIPLE PROGRAMS YOU OFFERED SOME REASSURANCE YESTERDAY THAT MANY OF THOSE. CANDACE PROGRAMS ARE WITHIN CONSOLIDATED UNDER DIFFERENT -- ADMINISTRATIVE. COMBINATIONS ONE OF THE AREAS THAT WE TALKED ABOUT. IS THE CURRENT PROGRESS CONSCIOUS IN THE INFECTIOUS DISEASE SECTOR PARTICULARLY UPTAKE OF VACCINATIONS IN SCHOOLS COULD YOU PROVIDE US A CURRENT UPDATE OF BOTH PROGRESS AND CONTINUED CHALLENGES SURE SO WITH THE PASSAGE OF SB TWO SEVENTY SEVEN WHICH ELIMINATED THE PERSONAL BELIEF EXEMPTION WE WORKED REALLY HARD. ACROSS THE STATE TO EDUCATE AND TO PROVIDE INFORMATION ON THE ON HEALTH THAT LOG WE SHOULD BE IMPLEMENTED AND WE REALLY STILL AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF VACCINATION THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND THAT. REALLY WAS A PROTECTIVE FACTOR AND NOW I'M ONLY RECENTLY WE'VE SEEN AN UPTICK IN MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS AND SO WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT BECAUSE ALTHOUGH. IT'S A SMALL UP TAKE A BIT DOES OCCUR IN SOME SCHOOLS WHERE IT LEAVES A LARGE NUMBER OF UNVACCINATED CHILDREN AND SO LOOKING FOR THE PUBLIC HEALTH RISK OF THAT WE WANT TO IDENTIFY THOSE SCHOOLS WHERE. THE VACCINATION RATE IS UNDER THE 95% WHICH WE THINK IS SORT OF WHAT YOU NEED TO PROTECT THE POPULATION AND SO BECAUSE SOME SCHOOLS AND DO YOU HAVE A LARGE NUMBER OF UNVACCINATED CHILDREN. WE ARE COLLECTING DATA THAT THEY HAVE TO REPORT EACH SCHOOL IS REQUIRED TO REPORT ON THEIR VACCINATION RATE AND WILL BE LOOKING OUT OF SCHOOLS WHERE THEY HAVE A LOWER VACCINATION RATE COLLECTING THE MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS. AND LOOKING AT WHETHER THERE ARE PARTICULAR LOCATIONS ARE DOCTORS THAT MIGHT BE. IN NEED OF SOME SPECIAL EDUCATION OR SOME -- MOVE THE M. FURTHER INFORMATION FROM SEE IN THE NEED FOR VACCINATION AND IN THE EVENT THAT THERE ARE BAD ACTORS THAN WE CAN TAKE OTHER ACTIONS. IN OUR THEIR STANDARDS OR CRITERIA. FOR FOR DOCTORS TO BE ABLE TO ANA -- SIGN IN A MEDICAL EXEMPTION THERE ARE THE STATUTE IS IS SPECIFIC ABOUT SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS THAT THEY NEED TO MEET IN ORDER -- TO MEET THE MEDICAL DEFINITION IT WOULD BE UNDER THE PURVIEW OF THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. TO PERIODICALLY REVIEW THE ISSUANCE OF THOSE MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS. IF WE WOULD GO THROUGH THE SCHOOLS SO WE WOULD IDEA WE DON'T. LOOK AT ALL OF THEM BUT WHAT WE WOULD LOOK AT IS THE PUBLIC HEALTH RISKS SO WHERE WE BELIEVE THE VACCINATION RATE IS LOW ENOUGH THAT IT PRESENTS A PUBLIC HEALTH RISK WE WOULD LOOK AT IT FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE WE WHEN. WE'RE NOT THE MEDICAL BOARD WOULD BE MORE APT IN TERMS OF THE ACTUAL. PARTICULAR DOCTORS AND LOOKING AT THAT. WELL THANK YOU I APPRECIATE YOUR ANSWERS AND I WAS. IMPRESSED WITH YEAR COMMAND IN KNOWLEDGE OF MULTIPLE PRAGUE PROGRAMS WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE THANK YOU. MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU SENATOR GROVE. THANK YOU I APOLOGIZE FOR BEING LATE WELCOME AND WELCOME. I IT DID NOT HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEND TIME WITH YOU YESTERDAY OR THE COUPLE OF DAYS AGO BECAUSE OF SCHEDULING CONFLICTS BUT I I WOULD LIKE TO SCHEDULE TIME WITH YOU IN THE FUTURE BECAUSE I DO HAVE A SERIES OF QUESTIONS THAT AFFECT THE VALLEY. ESPECIALLY DEALING WITH VALLEY FEVER THAT I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW YOUR OPINIONS ON IN YOUR THOUGHT PROCESS AND HOW WE'RE GOING TO ADDRESS THAT. BUT JUST TO START AND LAST YEAR'S BUDGET PROVIDED FUNDING FOR RESEARCH AND OUTREACH ON VALLEY FEVER CAN YOU TELL ME THE STATUS OF THOSE FUNDS AND IF THEY'VE BEEN DISTRIBUTED FOR RESEARCH. THE RESEARCH FUNDS DIDN'T ACTUALLY COME TO US THE RESEARCH FUNDS WENT TO THE KERN MEDICAL CENTER WE GOT FUNDING TO RUN A PUBLIC. INFORMATION EDUCATION CAMPAIGN -- AND WE CONTRACTS THE BIDS THAT CAME IN AND WE'LL BE WARDING A CONTRACT -- NEXT MONTH. I'M IN OKAY. AT SPECIFICALLY THE THINGS THAT I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT NINE AND WE'LL TALK TO YOU ABOUT IT IN PRIVATE BUT JUST SO YOU KNOW KIND OF WHERE I'M GOING WITH THIS IS THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH ME TO STATEMENT REGARDING -- TITLE EIGHT SECTION FIFTY ONE FORTY FOUR AN ENDEMIC AREAS FOR VALLEY FEVER. AND I MEG GREATLY CONCERNED ABOUT THOSE THOSE STATEMENTS AND I'D LIKE TO HAVE A PRIVATE CONVERSATION IF WE COULD GET TOGETHER I'D REALLY REALLY APPRECIATE THAT. AND THEN -- I HAVE A QUESTION I DON'T KNOW IF THE CHAIR AND IS -- THE MAN PER TIM ARE YOU GOING TO TALK ABOUT SAN DIEGO IN THE OUTBREAK -- I JUST WAS CURIOUS ABOUT -- I AM BUT FEEL FREE TO ASK THE QUESTIONS I'LL ASK WHATEVER I FEEL I NEED TO THAT YOU DON'T OKAY PLEASE GO RIGHT SO I GUESS. MY QUESTION WAS IS IT -- IN IMPLEMENTING THE STATE AUDITOR'S RECOMMENDATIONS ON THE RECENT REPORTED THE HEPATITIS A OPERATE IN SAN DIEGO -- WHERE ARE YOU OUT I APOLOGIZE I NEED TO SLOW DOWN? THAT WAS VERY DESCRIPTIVE SOAP. MISS FINALE WHERE ARE YOU AT IN IMPLEMENTING THE AUDITOR'S RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ITS RECENT REPORT ON THE HEPATITIS A OUTBREAK IN SAN DIEGO. SO WE HAD TO FEW TO FINDINGS OKAY AND ONE WAS -- TO UPDATE OUR EMERGENCY OPERATIONS MANUAL WHICH IS BASICALLY TO PUT A LITTLE BIT MORE DETAIL ON THE EMERGENCY POWERS THAT PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICERS HAVE AND SO THAT HAS BEEN DONE AND WE'VE UPDATED OUR EMERGENCY PLAN. THE SECOND WAS TO CREATE AN OUTBREAK RESPONSE PLAN WITH A LITTLE MORE DETAIL AND WE HAVE DONE NOT AS WELL AND WHAT THEY WANTED WAS TO HAVE SOME SPECIFIC PARAMETERS AROUND -- AND WHAT ARE THE STRATEGIES HELP SO THAT IN OUR CONVERSATIONS WITH OUR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS THAT WE FROM THE GET GO SORT OF HAVE A PROJECT PLAN ALMOST IN TERMS OF THE SPECIFIC -- ACTIVITIES THAT WILL BE UNDERTAKEN AND SO WE HAVE COMPLETE AT THAT AS WELL. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE YOUR ANSWERING THOSE QUESTIONS. THANK YOU SENATOR SENATOR ROTH HUMAN PRO TEM. SLOWLY FIRST CONGRATULATIONS THANK YOU. YOU KNOW I NOTED IN THE IN OUR RULES COMMITTEE NOTES THAT YOU HAVE IDENTIFIED OBESITY DIABETES AND MENTAL HEALTH IS KEY PRIORITIES FOR THE DEPARTMENT MOVING FORWARD IN THE FUTURE. AS FAR AS SOME OF US ARE CONCERNED PARTICULAR WITH RESPECT -- TO TYPE ONE DIABETES. THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT NEED FOR A FURTHER EDUCATION EFFORTS IN THE STATE TWO TWO INCIDENCES OF MISDIAGNOSIS AND THE LIKE PARTICULARLY WITH YOUNG. CHILDREN AND IN THE AREA OF MENTAL HEALTH. DUE. TO A FAIRLY SIGNIFICANT DISPARITY AND MENTAL HEALTH FUNDING PARTICULARLY UNDER THE NINETEEN NINETY ONE REALIGNMENT. FOR MENTAL HEALTH FUNDING IN VARIOUS AREAS OF THE STATE. THERE'S A NEED -- FOR IN MY OPINION MENTAL HEALTH FUNDING PARITY [inaudible] SO. GIVEN THE PRIORITIES THAT YOU'VE IDENTIFIED FOR THE DEPRIVE DEPARTMENT PARTICULARLY THOSE WITH RESPECT TO DIABETES AND MENTAL HEALTH -- WHAT ARE YOUR PLANS? SO RIGHT NOW FOR MENTAL HEALTH WE HAVE A A SERIES OF ACTIVITIES THAT WE ARE DOING ONE IS THE CALIFORNIA REDUCING DISPARITIES PROJECT -- AND THAT PROGRAM IS AROUND FIVE DIFFERENT POPULATION AREAS AND REALLY WORKING WITH COMMUNITY LEVEL FOLKS ON THE GROUND TO LOOK AT POPULATIONS FROM -- ASIAN AND ASIAN POPULATIONS AFRICAN AMERICAN -- LGBT Q. -- THE AND REALLY LOOKING AT THOSE POPULATIONS AND COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE PROMISING PRACTICES THAT MAY NOT BE A HAVE BEEN ABLE TO QUALIFY FOR BIG GRANT PROGRAMS AND THINGS BUT WORKING WITH THEM. BECAUSE WE THINK THEY HAVE GOOD IDEAS AND LEARNING I'M ON THE RESOURCES THEY NEED TO CONDUCT A REAL EVALUATION AND COLLECT DATA SO THAT WE CAN OVER TIME SEE WHAT ACTUALLY IS WORKING ON THE GROUND AND SO. WE'VE BEEN WERE THE SET IN OUR SECOND YEAR OF A FIVE YEAR SORT OF PILOT PROJECTS AND I THINK THAT WE WILL WE HAVE AN OVERALL EVALUATION STRATEGY SO THAT EVERYBODY. REGARDLESS OF THE TYPE OF PROGRAM THAT THEY'RE RUNNING THE EVERYBODY WILL COLLECT SOME STANDARD DATA SO THAT WE CAN SEE WHAT WORKS AND WHY IT WORKS. AND I THINK THAT'S A BIG EFFORT THAT WERE UNDER WAY ON THE MENTAL HEALTH SIDE MANY OF OUR PROGRAMS AND IN OUR MATERNAL AND CHILD. AND ADOLESCENT HEALTH TO ALSO ADDRESS MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES SO OUR HOME VISITING PROGRAM PART OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO TO IMPROVE OUTCOMES OF MOTHERS AND BABIES IS REALLY TO LOOK AT NOT JUST HEALTH CARE AND ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE ABOUT THOSE. COMMUNITY LINKAGES THAT CAN BUILD RESILIENCY IN OUR POPULATION AND THINGS LIKE STRESS MANAGEMENT AND LINKAGE TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES CAN REALLY BUILD THE AND OUR POPULATION AND SO I THINK THOSE ARE. SOME OF THE THINGS WE'RE DOING ON MENTAL HEALTH AND WE'RE ALSO WORKING WITH ALL OUR STAKEHOLDERS UNDER THE LET'S GET HEALTHY CALIFORNIA PROJECT. ARE ARE OF STATE HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PLAN TO AND MENTAL HEALTH COMES UP ACROSS THE BOARD WITH MANY OF OUR STAKEHOLDERS AS AN AREA WHERE WE WANT TO WORK MORE CLOSELY TOGETHER TO ADDRESS AND HOPEFULLY HAVE SOME COLLECTIVE IMPACT AROUND THOSE ISSUES. ON DIABETES UNFORTUNATELY DON'T RECEIVE A LOT OF MONEY TO DEAL WITH DIABETES BUT WE HAVE A PROGRAM CALLED PREVENTION FORWARD. ON A WHERE WE ARE TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE WORKING WITH OUR CLINICAL PARTNERS AND MEDI CAL AND DH CS AND TO IDENTIFY AND DIAGNOSE DIABETES MUCH MORE MUCH EARLIER TO EDUCATE PEOPLE BECAUSE NOT ONLY DIABETES BUT THOSE WITH PRE DIABETES AND TRYING TO KEEP THEM FROM GETTING. DIABETES SO WE HAVE -- AN AWARENESS CAMPAIGN MEMBER WEBSITE OF INFORMATION AND WE'RE WORKING. PARTNERING WITH HEALTH CARE TO MAKE SURE [inaudible] TO DIABETES EXERCISE DIET ISMUCH DIFFERENT IN TYPE ONE WHICH IS AN AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE. AND VERY DIFFICULT -- TO AT TO DIAGNOSE AND FREQUENTLY MISDIAGNOSED PARTICULARLY IN CHILDREN. AND SO I WOULD ASK YOU TO TAKE A LOOK AT YET THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT YOU HAVE IN YOUR DEPARTMENT. TO PERHAPS -- EMBARK ON A PUBLIC EDUCATION CAMPAIGN WHETHER IT'S THE PUBLIC GENERALLY REALLY HEALTHCARE PRACTITIONERS -- TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T HAVE -- SOME OF THE MISDIAGNOSES THAT WE HAVE EXPERIENCED IN THE PAST AND WE DIDN'T GET TWO POINT FIVE MILLION FOR A DIABETES AWARENESS CAMPAIGN WHICH WILL BE. COMING UP SHORTLY AND SO WE'LL. TAKE UP BACK AND MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE THINKING ABOUT THAT AS WELL PERFECT CONGRATULATIONS AGAIN MA'AM THANK YOU MA'AM PRO TEM. THANK YOU SENATOR MISTER VICE CHAIRMAN. THANK YOU MADAM -- PRO TEN ENJOYED OUR CONVERSATION YESTERDAY WAS VERY WIDE RANGING AND I AGREE WITH CENTER MONEY. YOU CERTAINLY HAVE A GRASP OF THE ISSUES A LIKE YOUR QUESTIONS WHICH ACTUALLY US COURSES I WANTED ASKED I WANTED TO FOLLOW UP ON THE VACCINATIONS. SO -- I'VE BEEN VACCINATED HAS AS MY WIFE AND MY CHILDREN SO I'M PRO VACCINATION -- I'D ADD THOUGH I HAVE A HUNDRED WE HAD THE WHOLE SB TWO SEVEN SEVEN I HAVE MET WITH FAMILIES. THAT HAVE SAID HAD CHILDREN THAT SUFFERED YOU KNOW BACK AND HE BACKS NATION DAMAGE SO I I DO KNOW EXIST WHEN I'M CURIOUS ON THE DATA THOUGH. B. E. THINK IT'S PEOPLE ARE AVOIDING IT OR DO YOU THINK. PEOPLE CAN'T FIND THE DOCUMENTATION SO WISHES EASIER ASK FOR MEDICAL EXEMPTION AND THEN MAYBE THOSE VACCINATION RATES ARE OF THAT ARE HIGHER THAN WHAT WE THINK. THIS I'M JUST CURIOUS I'M I'M I DON'T HAVE THE EXACT DATE -- BUT I DO THINK THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE INSTEAD OF USING A PERSONAL BELIEF EXEMPTION ARE LOOKING TO GET A MEDICAL EXEMPTION BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT THE VACCINATION -- BUT I THINK THERE ARE ALSO PEOPLE WHO GENERALLY GENUINELY NEED FOR MEDICAL EXEMPTION AND SO THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS WE WANT TO LOOK AT AS WERE COLLECTING THAT DATA BECAUSE ON THE EXEMPTION IT WILL LIST WHY THEY'VE GRANTED FOR A MEDICAL EXEMPTION AND I THINK WE WANT TO TAKE. A LOOK AT THAT. RIGHT LOGIN CONGRATULATIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR VICE CHAIRMAN -- ADD TO FOLLOW ALONG ON THE HEPATITIS A OUTBREAK IN SAN DIEGO. THAT THEN LTIMATELY THERE WERE CASES AND SANTA CRUZ IN LOS ANGELES. I WANT TO UNDERSTAND -- AND I UNDERSTAND THE COUNTIES HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO DECLARE AN EMERGENCY THERE ARE ACTIONS THAT NEED TO BE TAKEN -- HOWEVER THIS WAS A VERY LONG PERIOD OF TIME IN WHICH THERE WAS INACTION THERE WAS AN AUDIT I THINK WE GOT TO READ THAT BUT MY CONCERN. IS THAT I KIND OF WANT TO UNDERSTAND WINDOWS THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH STEP IN WHEN I COUNTY IS NOT DOING WHAT IT NEEDS TO DO. THIS WAS A LONG PERIOD OF MONTHS I EVEN MADE A CALL TO THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE -- AS THOSE NUMBERS STARTED TO INCREASE FROM IN THE FIVE HUNDRED EIGHTY SEVEN CASES AND FOUR HUNDRED TO HOSPITALIZATION SO MY WORRY. IS AT WHAT POINT I IT HOW DO YOU MONITOR A COUNTIES RESPONSE WHEN YOU BECOME AWARE OF THE PENDING SITUATION -- AND THERE IS NOT THE MOST RESPONSIBLE ACTION TAKEN ON THE PART OF THE COUNTY OR JURISDICTION. AS SOON A I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT IN SAN DIEGO% COUNTY WE WERE WORKING WITH THE LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTION DAILY -- THROUGHOUT PROBABLY MOST OF THAT PERIOD AND LOOKING AT WHAT WE'RE THE STRATEGIES THAT THEY WERE USING FOR HYGIENE AND SANITATION AND VACCINATION OF THE AT RISK POPULATION AND SO. WE WERE WORKING HAND IN HAND WITH THE COUNTY WE WERE STRATEGIZING THEY WERE DOING A LOT OF WORK THROUGHOUT THAT PERIOD. I THINK THAT. WE ACTIVATED ARE EMERGENCY OPERATIONS SYSTEM UNDER OUR AND SORT OF AN EMERGENCY PLAN WHEN AND THAT IS WHEN WE WOULD THEN -- AND ACTIVATE OUR EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTER BRINGING TOGETHER ALL OF THE COUNTY'S SHARE THAT INFORMATION -- MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE COLLECTING IT IS A REPORTABLE DISEASE WE COLLECT THAT DATA WE HAD BEEN COLLECTING THAT DATA WORKING WITH THEM. AND IT BECAME MORE. I I THINK WE CONTINUE THAT WORK WE WORKED WITH THEM ON THE VACCINE DISTRIBUTION -- PRIORITIZATION OF VACCINE MAKING SURE THAT THEY HAD ALL THE TOOLS AND KNOWLEDGE THAT THEY NEEDED. TO GET OUT THERE AND BOXING THE NEW POPULATION THIS WAS SOMETHING NEW WE HADN'T SEEN HAPPEN A IN OUR HOMELESS POPULATION IV DRUG USERS SO I THINK WE WERE LEARNING A LOT. ALONG WITH MANY OTHER STATES AND I THINK IF YOU LOOK AT THE MIDWEST IN MICHIGAN AND OTHER STATES THEY WERE FACING THE SAME THING AND AND I'M PART OF A LOT OF VAST -- POLICY COMMITTEE AND WE WERE COMPARING NUMBERS AND REALLY LOOKING UP THE ABILITY. TO TURN THE TIDE ON THE OUTBREAK AND CAL -- THAN MOST IT'S WITH SOME SINCE I THE OUTBREAKS BLASTED LONGER AND WERE BAKER -- SO I THINK THAT THERE WAS A LOT OF IMPORTANT WORK BEING DONE AND CAN WE ALWAYS GO BACK AND SAY COULD WE HAVE DONE A LITTLE MORE A LITTLE SOONER I I DON'T KNOW AND BUT I THINK THAT THEY WERE DOING A LOT OF WORK. ON THE GROUND. TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF AND AND LESSEN THE OUTBREAK OUT OF WELL WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO DISAGREE ON THAT. BY THEY FAILED MISERABLY WHICH IS WHY THERE WAS AN AUDIT WHEN A LEGISLATOR GETS INVOLVED TO ASK FOR AN AUDIT ON A REAL SITUATION NOT ONE THAT WE CONTRIVE. WHICH I KNOW THAT WE WANT TO DO IT TIMES -- EIGHTY A PLAN OF ACTION AND EDUCATE. CATION THAT CAN GO DOWN. MAN OF ACTION IN EDUCATION DOES NOT SUGGEST THAT YOU SEND HOMELESS PEOPLE TO CLINICS -- WHEN THERE'S A PROBLEM YOU GOT TO GO ON THE STREETS AND AND DO THE WORK WHICH ULTIMATELY WE DID? I MEAN WE'RE TALKING A PERIOD OF MONTHS. AT WHICH POINT. OF I MEAN I GUESS WHEN THE COUNTY FAILS WHEN THE CITY FAILS. AND THE STATE IS NOT A BACKUP. THAT CONCERNS ME AND THIS THIS EXAMPLE I AGREE WE HADN'T SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT FOR SOME TIME BUT THERE IS CLEAR DOCUMENTATION THERE IS CLEAR EVIDENCE. THAT PEOPLE WERE RAISED IN THE RED FLAG. AND AT SOME POINT. CALL STARTED TO GO TO THE STATE BECAUSE THE LOCAL JURISDICTION WASN'T ACTING. SO. FOR ME I THINK THE IMPLEMENTATION PIECE OF THIS WAS WHAT CONCERNS ME THE MOST -- AND AND THE FACT THAT -- COUNTIES NEED TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE MY OWN COUNTY WHO I'VE HAD A AND A WONDERFUL WORKING RELATIONSHIP WITH -- AND THE CITY IT DID NOT GO WELL IF SO IF THAT'S IN IT EXAMPLE I MEAN ONCE THE VACCINATIONS GOT THERE ONCE THEY DECIDED TO GO ON TO THE STREETS. TO ACTUALLY FIND THE PEOPLE AND GO INTO THE RIVER BEDS -- I WENT IN A SAN DIEGO RIVER CONSERVANCY BRINGS UP THE ISSUE OF ONE OF THEIR MEETINGS. AND BY AND FAR THEY ARE NOT THE ONE YOU. ARE AT A BOARD MEETING -- I HAVE I HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THAT AND MAYBE THAT'S WHY THERE'S A PIECE OF LEGISLATION WHICH IS NOT OUR PURPOSE TO TALK ABOUT TODAY IN TERMS OF ACCOUNTABILITY BUT I I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THE RESPONSE -- YOUR I WOULD JUST SAY DIFFICULT CONCLUDE YOUR RESPONSE. DIDN'T MAKE ME FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE ABOUT THE SITUATION. BECAUSE WHEN THE COUNTYFAILS TO ACT AND WE PUT IN A CALL. TO THE TO THE BACKUP. AND AND TO THINK THAT THAT RESPONSE OVER A PERIOD OF MONTHS WAS ADEQUATE IT IT REALLY WASN'T SO. I HOPE THE AUDITOR'S REPORT -- WILL LINDA A LITTLE BIT -- TOO TO HELP. A SMALL FORWARD AND AND WORK ON SOME OF THESE ISSUES. ON A ANOTHER TOPIC AND YOUR I'M HAPPY TO HEAR YOUR RESPONSE TO THAT AS WELL I I WANT TO BE FAIR -- ANOTHER AVE AREA THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC. I WOULD I AND I KNOW THAT THERE IT SEEMS FROM THE RESPONSES -- TO QUESTIONS THERE'S A LOT OF DATA BEING COLLECTED ON HOW TO APPROACH THAT. I I THINK I'M INTERESTED IN IMPLEMENTATION MOVING TO AND AND AND AND YOUR PERSPECTIVE ON WHAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS DOING OR NOT DOING AND HOW YOU SEE THE NEXT STEPS RELATED. TO HANDLE AND QUITE A CRISIS IT'S ACROSS AMERICA NOT JUST HERE IN CALIFORNIA. FOR THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS WE'VE BEEN AND LEADING THE STATEWIDE OPIOID WORKGROUP AND THAT IS WHERE WE BRING TOGETHER MULTI SECTORS FROM. HEALTH CARE TO YOU AND PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SO OUR SISTER DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES LAW ENFORCEMENT -- AND REALLY LOOK AT HOW WE CAN ACT WITHIN THE LANES THAT WE WORK AND AND COLLECTIVELY ADDRESS SOME OF THE ISSUES SO THAT WE HAVE BETTER. SAFE PRESCRIBING A AND TWO PHYSICIANS WE HAVE -- MEDICALLY ASSISTED TREATMENT OPTIONS WE HAVE ABOUT TWO THOUSAND DEATHS IN CALIFORNIA FROM OVERDOSES EVERY YEAR MAN TO PRESCRIPTION OPIOIDS AND SO REALLY LOOKING AT SAFE PRESCRIBING. AWARENESS -- MANY TIMES -- FOLKS DON'T EVEN KNOW THAT WHAT THEY'RE TAKING OUR OPIOIDS AND SO THERE BEEN SOME EFFORTS IN OTHER STATES TO LOOK AT HOW DO WE AND AND WITH OUR PUBLIC INFORMATION CAMPAIGN. TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE REALLY DO UNDERSTAND WHICH OF THE DRUGS THAT THEY MIGHT BE TAKING OUR OPIOIDS -- AND THEN REALLY AND WORKING TOGETHER TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE WORKING AT THE LOCAL LEVEL TWO YOU UNDERSTAND YOU. KNOW LOCKS ON DISTRIBUTING THE LOCKS ON AS THE COUNTERMEASURE TO AN OVERDOSE -- MAKING SURE WE HAVE ON OUR WEBSITE A STANDING ORDER FOR NALOXONE SO THAT PEOPLE CAN MORE READILY GOT ACCESS TO NALOXONE FOR THEIR LOVED ONES WERE IN PLACES WHERE THEY MIGHT. AND SEE SOMEBODY WITH AN OVERDOSE SO WE'RE WORKING COLLECTIVELY WE ARE BUILDING WE'VE GOTTEN SOME FEDERAL FUNDING WE ARE REALLY THINK THAT WHAT WE NEED IS TIMELY AND ACTIONABLE DATA SO THAT WE CAN BRING. TOGETHER EMS STATE I'M REAL TIME ALONG WITH -- OUR HEALTH CARE UTILIZATION DATA AND WHERE THIS SO WE CAN TARGET SINCE OUR PUBLIC I AM SO I THINK WE SO LOOKING AT LABORATORY TESTING AND ENHANCING OUR LABORATORY TESTING FOR THINGS LIKE FAN ALL.
