OPPOSITION TO SB SIXTY NO ONE A

00:36:44.101 --> 00:36:45.803
WELL WE CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE

00:36:45.870 --> 00:36:47.572
INTENSE OF THE BILL TO KEEP JOBS

00:36:47.638 --> 00:36:49.140
HERE IN CALIFORNIA OUR CONCERN

00:36:49.206 --> 00:36:51.075
ULTIMATELY WITH THIS BILL IN THE

00:36:51.142 --> 00:36:53.077
PRIOR BILL IS THAT IT WOULD DO

00:36:53.144 --> 00:36:53.911
THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT THE BILL

00:36:53.978 --> 00:36:55.713
DOES IS PENALIZED ANY COMPANY

00:36:55.780 --> 00:36:57.114
THAT HAS CALL CENTRE OPERATIONS

00:36:57.181 --> 00:36:58.916
IN CALIFORNIA THAT DECIDES TO

00:36:58.983 --> 00:37:00.851
LATER MOVE THOSE OPERATIONS TO A

00:37:00.918 --> 00:37:02.086
DIFFERENT COUNTRY. THE FIRST

00:37:02.153 --> 00:37:04.755
REQUIRES BUSINESSES TO PROVIDE A

00:37:04.822 --> 00:37:05.756
HUNDRED TWENTY DAYS NOTICE

00:37:05.823 --> 00:37:07.158
BEFORE ANY SUCH MOVE AND ANY

00:37:07.224 --> 00:37:08.926
EVEN GOOD FAITH MISTAKE OF THAT

00:37:08.993 --> 00:37:10.962
WOULD SUBJECT THEM TO PENALTIES

00:37:11.028 --> 00:37:12.396
THAT ARE PRETTY STAGGERING OF

00:37:12.463 --> 00:37:14.465
TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS PER DAY

00:37:14.532 --> 00:37:16.467
PLUS PENALTIES UNDER PAGA. A

00:37:16.534 --> 00:37:18.202
SECOND THE BILL WOULD REQUIRE

00:37:18.269 --> 00:37:20.104
DIR TO POST THE NAME OF THOSE

00:37:20.171 --> 00:37:21.706
COMPANIES ONLINE AND THEN MOST

00:37:21.772 --> 00:37:23.441
SIGNIFICANTLY IT WOULD REQUIRE

00:37:23.507 --> 00:37:25.042
CALIFORNIA TO DENY THOSE

00:37:25.109 --> 00:37:27.044
COMPANIES ANY STATE BENEFITS OR

00:37:27.111 --> 00:37:29.246
GRANTS OR TAX CREDITS FOR A FULL

00:37:29.313 --> 00:37:31.248
FIVE YEARS I WON COMPANIES ARE

00:37:31.315 --> 00:37:32.550
WEIGHING YOU KNOW WHERE TO PLACE

00:37:32.617 --> 00:37:34.118
NEW JOBS THESE ARE THE KINDS OF

00:37:34.185 --> 00:37:35.953
LAWS THAT WE ARE VERY CONCERNED

00:37:36.020 --> 00:37:37.888
ABOUT WILL TO TURN THEM FROM

00:37:37.955 --> 00:37:38.522
CHOOSING CALIFORNIA AND THAT'S

00:37:38.589 --> 00:37:39.423
ESPECIALLY TRUE WHEN YOU'RE

00:37:39.490 --> 00:37:41.025
THINKING ABOUT JOBS LIKE THOSE

00:37:41.092 --> 00:37:42.093
LOCATED IN A CALL CENTER THAT

00:37:42.159 --> 00:37:44.095
CAN EASILY BE DONE REMOTELY IN

00:37:44.161 --> 00:37:46.397
OTHER STATES- TWO YEAR AT SORRY

00:37:46.464 --> 00:37:47.865

THE INTENT TO PROTECT JOBS HERE

00:37:56.140 --> 00:37:57.541
THAT HIS CONCERN AS WELL WAS

00:37:57.608 --> 00:37:58.743
THAT THIS WOULD DETER COMPANIES

00:37:58.809 --> 00:38:00.244
FROM INVESTING IN CALIFORNIA

00:38:00.311 --> 00:38:02.513

00:44:41.211 --> 00:44:43.213
ISSUE HERE IS WHILE WE SEE THE

00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:44.948
VALUE OF WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO

00:44:49.586 --> 00:44:51.955
HAS CHANGED AND WHAT WE'RE DO

00:44:52.022 --> 00:44:53.390
SEEING NOW IS MOST OF THESE CALL

00:44:53.457 --> 00:44:56.160
CENTERS ARE NOT IN AMERICA.

00:44:56.226 --> 00:44:57.494
THERE IN OTHER COUNTRIES YOU

00:44:57.561 --> 00:44:58.762

00:44:58.829 --> 00:45:01.098
MIGHT FIND ONE IN LOUISIANA.

00:45:01.165 --> 00:45:02.232
MIGHT EVEN FIND ONE A TEXAS

00:45:02.299 --> 00:45:04.401
STILL. BUT MOST ALL AROUND THE

00:45:04.468 --> 00:45:07.304
COUNTRY EAST INDIA. AND THAT'S

00:45:07.371 --> 00:45:09.540
WHERE THEY'RE AT. AND WHEN

00:45:09.606 --> 00:45:10.941
THEY'RE LOOKING AT THE DOLLARS

00:45:11.008 --> 00:45:12.709
AND CENTS IN THE BOTTOM LINE HOW

00:45:12.776 --> 00:45:14.344
TO. GET THINGS DONE. IT'S NOT

00:45:14.411 --> 00:45:16.747

THESE. ARE BUSINESSES THAT ARE

00:45:24.688 --> 00:45:26.190
MOVING. BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE

00:45:26.256 --> 00:45:28.425
ENOUGH MONEY TO COMPETE. THEY

00:45:28.492 --> 00:45:29.626
ARE MORE PROFITABLE IN ANOTHER

00:45:29.693 --> 00:45:32.463
COUNTRY. AND WE ARE USING THOSE

00:45:32.529 --> 00:45:33.197

MOVE MUCH FARTHER EVEN IF WE ALL

00:45:46.110 --> 00:45:48.145
VOTE ON IT AND SEND IT FORWARD

00:45:48.212 --> 00:45:50.581

01:00:54.817 --> 01:00:57.220
INCREDIBLE AND THEY OFTEN SAY

THAT NOT EVERYONE IS MEANT TO GO

AS THEORETICAL TRAINING AND IT

01:01:09.165 --> 01:01:10.533
TAKES YEARS FOR THEM TO GET

01:01:12.935 --> 01:01:14.303
THEY TOLD ME THAT IT'S IMPORTANT

01:01:14.370 --> 01:01:16.105
TO BE ABLE TO MEASURE TWICE AND

01:01:16.172 --> 01:01:18.574
CUT ONCE AND ALSO INCREASE THE

01:01:18.641 --> 01:01:20.376
LIKELIHOOD OF LIABILITY

LITIGATION FOR MY FRIENDS AND

01:01:23.046 --> 01:01:24.480

THAT'S REALLY CRITICAL. HERE IN

01:01:29.085 --> 01:01:31.020
OUR STATE IN CALIFORNIA. I KNOW

01:01:31.087 --> 01:01:31.988

01:01:32.055 --> 01:01:33.356
COMMITTEE WHERE AGREEMENTS HAS

01:01:33.423 --> 01:01:34.991
THE OPPORTUNITY. FOR INDIVIDUALS

01:01:35.058 --> 01:01:36.893
AND TRADE ORGANIZATIONS TO WORK

01:01:36.959 --> 01:01:38.094
WHERE THEY LIVE IN THE

01:01:38.161 --> 01:01:39.862
COMMUNITY. I THINK ESPECIALLY

01:01:39.929 --> 01:01:42.165
FOR NOW. THAT GAS PRICES AS MUCH

01:01:42.231 --> 01:01:44.467
AS YOU KNOW TEN DOLLARS A GALLON

01:01:44.534 --> 01:01:46.135
SO. I THINK THIS IS A GOOD

01:01:46.202 --> 01:01:47.103
BALANCE BEFORE SUPPORTING IT

01:01:47.170 --> 01:01:49.605

HOPEFUL THAT THAT CAN HAPPEN

BECAUSE I THINK THE REALITY IS

01:02:04.487 --> 01:02:05.188
THERE ARE SOME SMALL COUNTIES

01:02:05.254 --> 01:02:06.889

ON OUT. IT'S THAT- THERE WILL BE

01:16:07.029 --> 01:16:08.697
A POINT OF CONTACT THAT WERE

01:16:08.764 --> 01:16:09.364
CREATING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:16:09.431 --> 01:16:11.066
AND DOES RELATIONS SO IF OSHA I

01:16:11.133 --> 01:16:12.567
WERE INTENTIONALLY ENSURING THAT

01:16:12.634 --> 01:16:14.870
THEY'RE DIRECTING THOSE TO THE

01:16:14.937 --> 01:16:15.938
DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL

01:16:16.004 --> 01:16:17.406

INVESTIGATE SO YOU ARE CORRECT

01:16:19.408 --> 01:16:21.243
IN YOUR STATE FISHER SO ONE OF

01:16:21.310 --> 01:16:23.412
ONE OF THE ISSUES WE DISCOVERED

01:16:23.478 --> 01:16:24.313
AS WE WERE HAVING OUR HEARINGS

01:16:24.379 --> 01:16:26.214
WAS THAT THERE WERE FOUR OR FIVE

01:16:26.281 --> 01:16:27.149
DEPARTMENTS THAT WERE INVOLVED

01:16:27.215 --> 01:16:28.583
POSSIBLY IN HUMAN TRAFFICKING

01:16:28.650 --> 01:16:29.952
AND LABOR TRAFFICKING AND IT WAS

01:16:30.018 --> 01:16:31.153
THE PROBLEM THE PROBLEM WAS THEY

01:16:31.219 --> 01:16:32.888
WERE GOING LIKE THIS. RIGHT THEY

01:16:32.955 --> 01:16:34.556
WERE MAKING THE CONNECTIONS AND

01:16:34.623 --> 01:16:35.824
SO ON VICTIMS WOULD FALL THROUGH

01:16:35.891 --> 01:16:37.225
THE CRACKS AND SO WHAT WE'RE

01:16:37.292 --> 01:16:38.927
HOPING IS THAT WE CAN CENTRALIZE

01:16:38.994 --> 01:16:40.696
IT A LITTLE BIT RIGHT THAT SOME

01:16:40.762 --> 01:16:42.898
OF THAT WILL END IT WASN'T THE

01:16:42.965 --> 01:16:43.498
PEOPLE THAT DEPARTMENT FOLKS

01:16:43.565 --> 01:16:44.032
WERE INTERESTED IN DOING

01:16:44.099 --> 01:16:45.300
SOMETHING RIGHT BUT DEPENDING ON

01:16:45.367 --> 01:16:47.402

01:16:47.469 --> 01:16:48.737
GOING ON INTERNALLY RIGHT AS TO

01:16:48.804 --> 01:16:49.972
WHETHER OR NOT THEY FELT IT WAS

01:16:50.038 --> 01:16:52.207
APPROPRIATE FOR THEM TO BE THE

01:16:52.274 --> 01:16:53.108
ONES TO START SOMETHING AS

01:16:53.175 --> 01:16:54.142
OPPOSED TO SOMEBODY ELSE AND SO.

01:16:54.209 --> 01:16:56.144
THAT'S ONE OF THE WHAT WHY WE

01:16:56.211 --> 01:16:57.746
MADE THE RECOMMENDATION COULD

01:16:57.813 --> 01:16:58.747
YOU PUT IT SOMEWHERE TECHNIC

01:16:58.814 --> 01:16:59.948
SOMEBODY RESPONSIBLE SO THAT

01:29:24.625 --> 01:29:26.561
EMPLOYEES UP BUT ANOTHER

01:29:26.627 --> 01:29:27.762
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE THAT I'VE

01:29:27.829 --> 01:29:30.198
HEARD FROM OUR CONTRACTORS IS

01:29:30.264 --> 01:29:31.632
THAT THERE ARE VERY FEW PLACES

01:29:31.699 --> 01:29:33.835
WHERE CONTRACT. AVAIL THEMSELVES

01:29:33.901 --> 01:29:35.470

01:42:57.371 --> 01:42:59.606
THREE DAYS HOWEVER THE PAIN AND

01:42:59.673 --> 01:43:01.275
TRAUMA CAUSED ME TO START

01:43:01.341 --> 01:43:03.210
DECIDING AND DEPRESSION YOU SEE

01:43:03.277 --> 01:43:05.212
I WAS ONLY GIVEN THREE DAYS OFF

01:43:05.279 --> 01:43:06.980
OF WORK AT THE TIME I DID NOT

01:43:07.047 --> 01:43:08.549
UNDERSTAND THAT IT WOULD TAKE

01:43:08.615 --> 01:43:10.017
FOURTEEN DAYS TO GET HIS BODY

FUNERAL ARRANGEMENTS IT IS SO

01:43:14.721 --> 01:43:16.423
