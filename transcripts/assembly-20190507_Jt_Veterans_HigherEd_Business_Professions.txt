TODAY AND I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIRS OF B. M. P. AND HIGHER ED. FOR AGREEING TO LOOK AT THIS ISSUE TOGETHER -- IN THIS VENUE AND THANK YOU -- TO YOU AS WELL WHO AGREED TO PARTICIPATE AND THE PANEL TODAY YOUR PARTICIPATION IS NECESSARY TO HAVE A THOROUGH DISCUSSION. EASING THE TRANSITION OF SERVICE MEMBERS TO CIVILIAN LIFE IS PART OF THE PROMISE MADE TO EACH AND EVERY PERSON WHO IS IN LISTED OR COMMISSIONED IN THE US MILITARY. AMONG THE PROGRAMS TO DO SO THE GI BILL IS THE ABSOLUTE GOLD STANDARD THE ORIGINAL SERVICEMEN'S READJUSTMENT ACT OF NINETEEN FORTY FOUR HELPED MILLIONS OF AMERICANS WHO FOUGHT IN WORLD WAR TWO TO ATTEND COLLEGE. IT WAS A BENEFITS SO ROBUST THAT IT CHANGE THE ENTIRE SYSTEM OF HIGHER EDUCATION. BUT FROM THE BEGINNING IT WAS MADE CLEAR THAT THERE WERE THOSE WHO WOULD EXPLOIT THE GI BILL AND THE VETERANS WHO EARNED THAT. OF MY CONCERNS WERE RAISED OVER APPARENT CONFLICT BETWEEN THE IMPAIR A CONFLICT BETWEEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND OUR STATE APPROVING AGENCY FOR VETERANS EDUCATION OVER HELD THE LAW WAS TO BE ENFORCED. THIS CONFLICT WAS OCCURRING RIGHT AROUND THE SAME TIME THAT THE EDUCATION CORPORATION OF AMERICA SCHOOLS ABRUPTLY SHUT DOWN EARLY LAST FALL. IN CALIFORNIA. THAT LEFT APPROXIMATELY FOUR HUNDRED VETERAN STUDENTS IN THE LURCH. EVERY MONTH OF THE GI BENEFIT FITS AT THAT A VETERAN SINKS INTO ATTENDING AT DEAD AND PROGRAM IS LOST THERE ARE NOW WAYS TO THAT VETERANS CONVERT COVER THEIR BENEFITS IN SOME CASES BUT THEY ARE. LIMITED THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THERE IS A PROBLEM THE QUESTION IS EXACTLY WHAT IT IS. WHY IT EXISTS AND HOW TO GO ABOUT FIXING IT? TO BE CLEAR FOR PROFIT COLLEGES HAVE A PLACE IN THE ENVIRONMENT OF HIGHER EDUCATION IN CALIFORNIA. THE QUESTIONS FOR ME ARE HOW DO WE ENSURE A HEALTHY SECTOR. WHAT ARE THE SYSTEMATIC PROBLEMS? WE HAVE TO SOLVE IN ORDER TO DO SO AND WHO PROVIDES THE OVERSIGHT AND HOW. THESE ARE SOME OF THE QUESTIONS% I HOPE TO EXPLORE IN THIS HEARING TODAY THEIR ANSWER SHOULD BE OF INTEREST NOT ONLY TO VETERANS AND THEIR FAMILIES BUT ALSO. TO THE FOR PROFIT SECTOR. MANY OF WHOSE WHOSE MEMBERS PROVIDE A GOOD EDUCATION TO THEIR STUDENTS VETERAN. AND STUDENTS ALIKE. AN ENVIRONMENTAL OF HEALTHY OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY WERE BAD ACTORS ARE NOT ABLE TO EXPLOIT VETERAN STUDENTS IS OUR SHARED INTERESTS. THE SOONER WE AGREE ON THAT AND A PATH FORWARD THE BETTER. AND NOW I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE MY OF THE CHAIR OF THE HI READ PLEASE MAKE A FEW COMMENTS. THANK YOU UP HERE IRWIN. VERY GLAD THAT WE COULD HAVE THIS JOINT. HEARING. RARELY DO WE SEE AN ISSUE THAT SPANS THE PURVIEW OF THREE POLICY COMMITTEES. YET THE OVERSIGHT OF THE VETERANS HIGHER EDUCATION. AND HOW THOSE ISSUES INTERACT WITH. PRIVATE POSTSECONDARY EDUCATION. IS A RARE EXCEPTION. THE MEMBERS OF OUR ARMED FORCES MAKE A PARTICULARLY POIGNANT SACRIFICE. TO THEIR COUNTRY. THEY OFTEN WORK LONG HOURS AWAY FROM THEIR FAMILY AND FRIENDS FOR MONTHS AT A TIME. THOSE IN THE PROFESSION OF ARMS TAKE THEIR OATH KNOWING THAT AMERICA IS GREAT YES. AMERICA'S ENGAGED IN ARMED CONFLICT AROUND THE WORLD. THEY MAY VERY LIKELY BE ASKED TO PUT THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE FOR OUR COUNTRY. AND ARE CALIFORNIA LARGEMENT TAKE THE EXTRA BURDEN OF DEPLOYING THROUGHOUT OUR STATE. TO COMBAT FIRES ANOTHER NATURAL DISASTERS SOMETIMES FOR SEVERAL MONTHS I AM. THE SACRIFICES ALSO CARRY WITH THEM CERTAIN BENEFITS. A REAL EXPECTATION THAT ONE SERVICE THERE SERVICE ENDS THAT ARE VETERANS WILL HAVE ACCESS TO MEDICAL CARE. THROUGH THE VA AND OF COURSE ACCESS. THROUGH THE WHEN GOVERNOR AGI BILL IN ORDER TO PURSUE THEIR EDUCATIONAL GOALS. THE WAY I SEE IT WE IN THE LEGISLATURE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO ENSURE THAT THESE BENEFITS. ARE NOT BEING EXPLOITED. WE HEARD TESTIMONY OVER THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS REGARDING SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT VETERANS OF FACE. IN THEIR PURSUIT OF A HIGHER EDUCATION. THIS IS NOT SIMPLY AN ISSUE FOR OUR PRODUCT PRIVATE. FOR PROFIT INSTITUTIONS VETERANS OF ALSO HAD TROUBLE TRANSLATING THEIR MILITARY SERVICE AND TO ACADEMIC CREDIT. OUR PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS. AND FOR TOO LONG VETERANS CAME TO OUR CAMPUSES FEELING ALONE AND LACKING A SENSE OF WELCOME AND COMMUNITY. THIS HEARING TODAY WILL HELP US TO UNDERSTAND MORE ABOUT HOW THE GI BILL IS USED BY OUR SERVICE MEMBERS. AND HOW ARE OVERSIGHT BODIES COORDINATE AND COMMUNICATE TO ENSURE THAT THAT BAD ACTORS ARE FLAG IN THAT PROGRAMS ARE TRULY SERVING OUR STUDENTS. FINALLY WILL HEAR TESTIMONY FROM THOSE OF YOU THAT CAN OFFER US A BOOTS ON THE GROUND PERSPECTIVE. FOR AN UPDATE ON THE VETERANS RESOURCE CENTERS AT OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE CAMPUSES. AND THE EXPERIENCE OF VETERANS IN THOSE VETERANS SERVICES ORGANIZATIONS THAT REPRESENT THEM. TO OUR OWN STATE SERVICE MEMBERS AND SOME OF THIS THE UNIQUE CHALLENGES THAT THEY FACE. THANK YOU ALL FOR MAKING TIME TO JOIN US TODAY. AND WITH THAT. I WILL BRING UP THE FIRST PANEL. AND INVITE PROFESSOR BOB MOVED. TO THE PODIUM [inaudible] WELCOME [inaudible] THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR. ONE JERRY DATA AND ASSEMBLY MEMBERS -- MY NAME IS BOTTOM YOUTH AND I'M A PROFESSOR AT THE UNIVERSITY OF SAN DIEGO SCHOOL OF LAW. MOST OF THE MANAGING ATTORNEY AND FOUNDER OF THE U. S. THESE VETERANS LEGAL CLINIC AND ROLLED IN FOR OUR HEARING TODAY I AM A MARINE CORPS VETERAN. WAS A MARINE OFFICER I'M ALSO RACK WAR VETERANS. IT IS MY HONOR AND PRIVILEGE TO HAVE THE UP TO PROVIDE TESTIMONY HERE TODAY ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE -- I'D LIKE TO BEGIN JUST TALKING JUST BRIEFLY ABOUT -- PUTTING THE GI BILL IN HISTORICAL CONTEXT. THE ORIGINALLY BEGAN AS A HIS CHAIR WINNER WHEN MENTION IS A SERVICE MEMBERS WE JUST AN ACT OF NINETEEN FORTY FOUR IT WAS COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS THE GI BILL. IT REGIONALLY INCLUDED THREE PARTS THERE WAS AN EDUCATION COMPONENT A VA HOME LOAN ASPECT AND ALSO SOME UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS. AND IT WAS DESIGNED AS A REMEDY FOR THE EXPERIENCE THE UNITED STATES -- SAWED HERE IN RESPONSE TO WORLD WAR ONE WHERE WE HAD LARGE NUMBERS OF VETERANS COMING HOME AND FAILING TO MAKE SUCCESSFUL TRANSITIONS BACK TO CIVILIAN LIFE -- THERE WAS ALSO SEEN AS A WAY TO HAVE A TANGIBLE THANK YOU TO OUR VETERANS FOR THE SERVICE THEY PROVIDED IN WORLD WAR TWO ON BEHALF OF OUR NATION. AND THEN TO SMOOTH THAT TRANSITION TO CIVILIAN LIFE. IT WAS WILDLY SUCCESSFUL IT IS OFTEN SEEN AS ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL PIECE OF LEGISLATION IN OUR GREAT COUNTRY SESTRI. IT IS CREDITED BY SCHOLARS AS BEING INSTRUMENTAL IN THE CREATION OF A ROBUST MIDDLE CLASS. IT EXPANDED HOMEOWNERSHIP DRAMATICALLY AND PROVIDED A PATHWAY TO HIGHER EDUCATION FOR THOSE WHO WEREN'T WEALTHY AT A TIME IN OUR COUNTRY WHEN THAT WAS NOT COMMON. THERE BEEN SUBSEQUENTLY RATIONS OF THE GI BILL TO ASSIST VETERANS FROM OUR SUBSEQUENT CONFLICTS. THE KOREAN WAR VETERANS ARE VIETNAM VETERANS PEACETIME VETERANS IN COLD WAR VETERANS UP THROUGH THE MONTGOMERY GI BILL. AND THEN TO TODAY THE FOREVER GI BILL AND POSTED ELEVEN GI BILL. HE TRANSFORMED OVER TIME -- ORIGINALLY IT WAS AS I DESCRIBED THANK YOU TO THOSE WHO HAD SERVED IN COMBAT. IT BECAME MORE OF A RECRUITMENT TOOL OFTENTIMES DURING TIMES OF PEACE. AND THE BENEFITS BECAME LESS GENEROUS NOT NOT NECESSARY BECAUSE CONGRESS REDUCE THE BENEFITS BUT PRIMARILY BECAUSE THEY SIMPLY DO NOT KEEP UP WITH THE COSTS OF HIGHER EDUCATION. THE POST ELEVEN GI BILL WAS PASSED IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT AND THE BENEFITS BEGIN FLOWING IN -- TWO THOUSAND NINE IT WAS THEN SUBSEQUENTLY AMENDED AS IS THE CALL MARY ACT. IN RECENT YEARS AND IT WAS COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS THE FOREVER GI BILL MAINLY BECAUSE THE BENEFITS WERE CHANGE THAT THERE WAS NO LONGER A FIFTEEN YEAR CAP ON TIME. TO USE THOSE BENEFITS BUT INSTEAD IT WOULD CONTINUE IN PERPETUITY FOR VETERANS WHO SERVED AFTER. TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN SINCE THE ENACTMENT OF POST NINE ELEVEN GI BILL MORE THAN NINETY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS AND PAID OUT IN BENEFITS TO MORE THAN TWO POINT ONE MILLION ELIGIBLE PERSONS. BASIC ELIGIBILITY REQUIRES THAT A VETERAN HAVE AT LEAST NINETY DAYS ON ACTIVE DUTY SINCE POST -- NINE ELEVEN OR THEY HAVE RECEIVED A PURPLE HEART AFTER NINE ELEVEN OR THEY HAVE THIRTY DAYS OF ACTIVE DUTY BUT DISCHARGE YOU TO SERVICE CONNECTED DISABILITIES OR A DEPENDENT CHILD WITH TRANSFER BENEFITS. DEPENDING UPON WHICH OF THOSE CATEGORIES A VETERAN FALLS INTO THEIR BENEFITS MAY BE PRO RATED -- BUT GENERALLY SPEAKING THE BENEFITS WITH RESPECT TO THE POST NINE ELEVEN GI BILL ARE VERY GENEROUS THEY PROVIDE TUITION HOUSING ALLOWANCE STATEMENT FOR BOOKS. PAYMENT OF CERTAIN FEES FOR LICENSING. EXAMS AND ETCETERA -- THERE'S A TOTAL OF A THIRTY SIX MONTH. THE BENEFITS IN THE IDEA BY THE CRAFTERS THE POST NINE ELEVEN GI BILL WAS THAT -- A VETERAN COULD RETURN FROM WAR. TRANSITION TO CIVILIAN LIFE AND PURSUE A A BACHELOR'S DEGREE OVER THE COURSE OF FOUR YEARS AND NINE MONTHS ACADEMIC YEAR. AND RECEIVE A QUALITY EDUCATION. THE MONEY CAN BE SPENT AT PUBLIC SCHOOLS PRIVATE SCHOOLS THAT ARE NONPROFIT OR PRIVATE FOR PROFIT SCHOOLS. IF THE SCHOOL COST MORE THAN THE CAP ON BENEFITS PER YEAR WHICH IS CURRENTLY TWENTY THREE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS. AND THERE'S A SPECIAL PROGRAM TO SHARE THOSE COSTS BETWEEN SCHOOL. AND THE VA IT'S A WONDERFUL PROGRAM BY ALL ACCOUNTS BUT PROBLEMS HAVE ARISEN. AND MANY OF THESE CHALLENGES ARE NOT NEW -- SOME OF THESE TYPES OF PROBLEMS OCCURRED WAY BACK WITH THE ORIGINAL GI BILL -- THAT BACK IN NINETEEN FORTY FOUR AND MANY OF THEM ARE DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE FOR PROFIT EDUCATION SECTOR AS WAS THE CASE BACK IN. NINETEEN FORTY FOUR AT THAT TIME. THE CREATION THE GI BILL DRAMATICALLY EXPANDED THE FOR PROFIT EDUCATION SECTOR. WITHIN THE FIRST FIVE YEARS AFTER ITS ENACTMENT. THE NUMBER OF FOR PROFIT SCHOOLS IN AMERICA TRIPLE AND THAT IS WITH THOUSANDS OF FOR PROFIT SCHOOLS CLOSING. AND THE PROBLEMS WERE WERE OFTEN MANY OF THE SAME ONES WE FACE HERE TODAY. THERE WERE FLY BY NIGHT SCHOOLS THEY HAVE PROVIDED SUBSTANDARD EDUCATION THEY WERE OVER CHARGING VETERANS. OFTENTIMES WE JUST SIMPLY OUTRIGHT FRAUD. CONGRESS REACTED WITH HEARINGS -- THEY BEGIN IMPOSING NEW REQUIREMENTS FOR EXAMPLE THEY REQUIRED THAT A SCHOOL COULD HAVE NO GREATER THAN A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF STUDENTS WHO WERE VETERANS USING EDUCATION BENEFITS. WITH THE NIGHT TOWARDS TRYING TO ENSURE A CERTAIN INDICIA OF CREDIBILITY FOR THOSE INSTITUTIONS. GRADUALLY BECAME LESS OF A PROBLEM OVER TIME IN PART BECAUSE OF THE SUCCESSFUL REGULATION EFFORTS AND ALSO BECAUSE THE BENEFITS BECAME LESS GENEROUS QUITE FRANKLY -- AS THE BENEFITS BECAME -- LESS BENEFICIAL TO THE VETERANS IT BECAME LESS OF A A REASON FOR THOSE FOR PROFIT SCHOOLS TO TARGET THE BETTER. TODAY WE SEE THE SAME TYPES OF PROBLEMS. NOW WHILE EVERY FOR PRIVATE SCHOOL IS NOT BAD. VIRTUALLY ALL THE PROBLEMS WE SEE AT A PLACE LIKE MY CLINIC HAPPEN IN THE FOR PROFIT SCHOOL SECTOR. IN IN IT MATTERS BECAUSE SO MANY OF OUR STUDENTS PARENTS ARE ATTENDING SCHOOLS AT FOR PROFIT SCHOOLS -- MORE THAN 20% OF STUDENT VETERANS HAVE ATTENDED A FOR PROFIT SCHOOL. APPROXIMATELY 9% OF FOR PROFIT SCHOOL STUDENTS ARE VETERANS -- SO I TONE OF MONEY IS GOING DIRECTLY TO THE FOR PROFIT EDUCATION SECTOR. ROUGHLY EIGHT OF THE TOP TEN RECIPIENTS OF FOR PROFIT -- CITY OF GI BILL BENEFITS ARE FOR PROFIT SCHOOLS. THE VAST MAJORITY OF INSTANCES WE HAVE SEEN IN OUR CLINIC WHICH PROVIDES PRO BONO LEGAL SERVICES TO OUR VETERANS SERVICE MEMBERS THEIR FAMILY. HAVE OCCURRED AT THESE FOR PROFIT SCHOOLS AS WELL. THE TYPES OF ISSUE WE SEE FALL BROADLY INTO TWO CATEGORIES. THE FIRST HAS TO DO WITH PRE ENROLLMENT AND THE SECOND IS POST ENROLLMENT IN THE PRE ROMAN FACE IT'S PRIMARILY RELATED TO PREDATORY RECRUITMENT EFFORTS. THAT ONE IS A PRETTY TO RECRUITMENT WHAT I MEAN IS WE'VE HAD CLIENTS COME TO US AND SAY THAT THEY HAVE BEEN LIED TO ABOUT ALMOST ANYTHING YOU COULD BE LIED TO ABOUT WITH RESPECT TO SCHOOLS PROGRAM. THAT MEANS VETERANS WHO'VE BEEN TOLD -- FALSE JOB PLACEMENT RATES. FALSE -- SALARY EXPECTATIONS AMOUNTS THEY'VE BEEN TOLD THEIR SCHOOL IS ACCREDITED ONE IS NOT. THEY HAVE BEEN TOLD -- THAT THEY COULD COMPLETE THEIR SCHOOL IN A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME WHEN IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE WE'VE EVEN HAD BETTER INTO BEEN TOLD. THAT THE SCHOOL COULD ACCOMMODATE THEIR SERIOUS SERVICE CONNECTED DISABILITIES WHEN THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO DO SO. THERE'S ALSO PROBLEMS AFTER ROLE THAT. WE'VE HAD DEADLINES COME TO US WHO SAID THAT THE QUALITY EDUCATION IS BEING PROVIDED WAS SIGNIFICANTLY LACKING AT THAT. INSTRUCTORS THAT WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE TEACHING THEM DID NOT HAVE THE REQUISITE CREDENTIALS OR KNOWLEDGE IN THE FIELD IN WHICH THEY WERE PROVIDING INSTRUCTION. AND THAT THE SCHOOLS TO SIMPLY DID NOT WOULD NOT MEET THEIR EXPECTATIONS OF WHAT THEY NEEDED TO BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY TRANSITION TO A CIVILIAN CAREER. AND WHILE MUCH OF WHAT I PROVIDED SO FAR HAS BEEN DATA IN IN AND GENERAL CATEGORIES OF PROBLEMSI THINK IT'S IMPORTANT WE WE DON'T LOSE SIGHT OF THE FACT THAT THEIR INDIVIDUAL VETERANS WERE REALLY BEING HARMED -- ONE OF OUR CLIENTS FOR EXAMPLE WAS A MARINE CORPS VETERAN WHO WAS SEVERELY INJURED AS A RESULT OF AN ENEMY ROCKET ATTACK WHILE HE WAS SERVING IN IRAQ. AMONG HIS MANY INJURIES ONE WAS A VERY DEVASTATING AUTOMATIC BRAIN INJURY. HOWEVER HE STILL WANTED TO AFTER LEADING -- SERVICE WITH AN HONORABLE DISCHARGE IS HONORABLY RETIRED. HE WANTED TO PURSUE A HIGHER EDUCATION SO THAT HE COULD-- IN HIS WORDS CONTINUE TO PARTICIPATE IN SOCIETY. UNFORTUNATELY HE ENROLLED AT A FOR PROFIT SCHOOL -- THE MISLED HIM WITH RESPECT TO WHAT TYPES OF JOBS HE COULD RECEIVE AT THE END -- THEY MISLED HIM WITH RESPECT TO HOW LONG SCHOOLS PROGRAM WOULD BE AND THEY TOLD HIM THAT THE SCHOOL IS ACCREDITED WHEN IT WAS NOT. ADDING INSULT TO INJURY AFTER HE LEFT THE SCHOOL HE CAME TO US AND WE DISCOVER THE SCHOOL CONTINUE TO RUN HIS GI BILL BENEFITS EVEN AFTER HE WAS NO LONGER ENROLLED IN THE SCHOOL -- IT'S JUST ONE EXAMPLE I CAN GIVE YOU DOZENS MORE OF INDIVIDUAL VETERANS WHO HAVE SERVED THEIR COUNTRY HONORABLY. RIDE TO DO THE RIGHT THING BY PURSUING HIGHER EDUCATION AND THEN WE WERE RAN INTO TROUBLE WHEN THEY USE THOSE BENEFITS AT FOR PROFIT SCHOOLS. THE PROBLEM WITH FOR PRIVATE SCHOOLS IS NOT ONLY WHAT HAPPENS WHILE THE STUDENTS THERE BUT IT OFTEN HAPPENS WHEN THE SCHOOL ABRUPTLY SHUTS DOWN. SO BROUGHT SCHOOL CLOSE TO BEEN IN THE NEWS FREQUENTLY WE UNFORTUNATELY ARE VERY. WELL RECEIVED ARE WELL UNDERSTOOD THIS PROBLEM HERE IN CALIFORNIA WITH RESPECT TO CREATE THE IN BUT THERE'S ANOTHER LARGE NATIONAL BRANDS THAT HAVE THAT HAVE CLOSED I TT EDUCATION CORPORATION OF AMERICA. AND ALSO MANY SMALLER SCHOOLS -- OR REGIONAL SCHOOLS. IN RECENT YEARS MORE THAN TWENTY TWO THOUSAND VETERANS WERE LEFT IN THE LURCH WHEN THEY'RE FOR PROFIT SCHOOL CLOSED. ONE OF FOR PROFIT SCHOOL CLOTHES IT'S PARTICULARLY HARD FOR VETERANS BOTH ACADEMICALLY AND NON ACADEMICALLY. ACADEMICALLY THE CREDIT SIMPLY DON'T TRANSFER SO A VETERAN WILL SEEK OUT THEIR TRANSCRIPT WHEN THE SCHOOL CLOSES NOT ONLY ARE THEY SLAP IN THE FACE WHEN THEY ATTEMPT TO GO TO SCHOOL ONE DAY AND FIND THE DOORS ARE CLOSED IT'S SHOCKING IS THAT IS. BUT THEN IF THEY CAN EVEN GET THEIR TRANSCRIPT THEY DISCOVER THAT NO THE GYM AT SCHOOL TAKE THEIR CREDITS. FROM A NON ACADEMIC PERSPECTIVE VETERANS ARE HIT HARD BECAUSE ONE OF THE CRITICAL COMPONENTS THE POST NINE ELEVEN GI BILL IS A HOUSING ALLOWANCE IN THE HOUSING LOANS IS VERY SIGNIFICANT. AND IT'S PARTICULAR LIES TO THE LOCATION WHERE THE STUDENTS ATTENDING SCHOOL. SO IN THE CONTEXT OF STUDENTS ATTENDING SCHOOL IN SAN FRANCISCO THEY MIGHT RECEIVE MANY MORE THOUSAND DOLLARS THAN A STUDENT WHO IS ATTENDING SCHOOL FOR EXAMPLE RIVERSIDE. AT THE IDEAS TO TRY TO MEET UP WITH THE COST OF LIVING SO THAT THE STUDENT VETERANS. CAN FOCUS ON THEIR EDUCATION AND NOT WORRY ABOUT PAYING THEIR BILLS AS ATTENDING SCHOOL. SO WHEN IS DOING BETTER IN SCHOOL CLOSES NOT ONLY DID THEY LOSE THEIR OPPORTUNITY TO PURSUE EDUCATION AT THAT SCHOOL. BUT THEY ALSO OFTENTIMES LOSE THEIR HOUSING BENEFIT AND THEN IN BECAUSE OF THAT THERE WERE NOT JUST ABOUT WHERE THERE'S LIKE SCHOOLS GOING TO BE BUT HOW THEY'RE GONNA CONTINUE THEIR PURSUIT OF A CAREER OPPORTUNITIES. BUT ALSO HOW THEY CAN KEEP HOME. HOW DO YOU KEEP A ROOF OVER THE HEADS OF THEMSELVES IN THEIR IN THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS? IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO MAKE A STUDENT HOLE IN ANY CONTEXT WHEN THEY HAVE BEEN HARMED BY A FOR PROFIT SCHOOL IT'S PARTICULARLY SO IN AN ABRUPT SCHOOL CLOSURE. THERE'S NO ONE LEFT TO SEE THERE'S NO ONE WHO IF A STUDENT AND WERE TO COME TO A PRO BONO CLINIC LIKE MINE. WELL WE CAN GO TO TRY. TO RETURN THOSE BENEFITS TO THAT AND EVEN IF WE WERE ABLE TO DO SO I CAN'T GIVE THEM BACK THEIR TIME YOU KNOW THESE ARE VETERANS WHO HAVE ALREADY SPENT YEARS OF THEIR LIVES IN SERVICE TO THEIR COUNTRY. THEY ARE READY TO MOVE ON AT THIS POINT AND CAN PURSUE THE REST OF THEIR LIFE AND SO AT THAT POINT WHEN THE SCHOOL CLOSES IN THE CREDITS CAN'T TRANSFER ANYWHERE AND THEY'VE WASTED THEIR BENEFITS. IT PUTS IN AN OFTENTIMES INTO A DOWNWARD SPIRAL WHERE THEY'RE SIMPLY NOT ANOTHER GOOD OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM AND THEY END UP TAKING WHATEVER JOB THEY CAN GET. WE'VE HAD CLIENTS WHO ENDED UP GOING BACK TO THE SAME RETAIL JOB THAT THEY HAD BEFORE THEY HAD INVESTED LITERALLY SEVENTY FIVE OR A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IN SCHOOL THAT CLOSED. OBVIOUSLY THERE FOR THE ISSUE SHOULD BE IF THERE'S FOCUSING TO BE AND WHAT TO DO AFTER THE VETERANS BEEN HARM SO MUCH IS HOW DO WE STOP THESE PROBLEMS FROM HAPPENING IN THE FIRST PLACE. AND I THINK THAT'S WHERE I WILL BE HOPEFULLY INTO THE THE SUBS ONE PANELS TODAY. ON THE OVERSIGHT ISSUES ARE VERY IMPORTANT THE VA OUT SOURCES OVERSIGHT TO STATE APPROVING AGENCY SO HERE IN CALIFORNIA THAT'S R. C. SAFETY CALIFORNIA STATE APPROVING AGENCY FOR BETTER EDUCATION. ARE THEY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE APPROVAL PROGRAMS OVERSIGHT OF EXISTING PROGRAMS AND IN TRAINING INDIVIDUALS RELATED TO THOSE PROGRAMS. THE V. A.'S OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL IN JUSTICE NUMBER OF THE PAST YEAR ISSUED A BLISTERING REPORT -- DESCRIBING HOW THE VA HAS PROVIDED INADEQUATE OVERSIGHT TO THEIR STATE APPROVING AGENCIES. WE FOUND THAT SPECIFICALLY STATE APPROVING AGENCIES LACKED EFFECTIVE SUFFICIENT CONTROLS TO ENSURE THE PROPER REVIEW AND EVALUATION OF PROGRAMS PROGRAM MODIFICATION ADVERTISEMENTS. AFTER PROGRAMS WERE APPROVED. CALIFORNIA HOWEVER I'M GLAD REPORT HAS A REPUTATION FOR VIGOROUSLY DEFENDING THE RIGHTS OF OUR STUDENTS. THEY ARE SEEN WITHIN THE COMMUNITY WITHIN THE VETERANS COMMUNITY AS BEING A CHAMPION OF PROTECTING STUDENT VETERANS AND UNFORTUNATELY BECAUSE OF THIS REPUTATION THEY HAVE DRAWN THE IRE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS. IT IS CREATED ALL KINDS OF ISSUES THAT I'M SURE WILL BE EXPLORED IN SUBSEQUENT PANELS -- WHERE WHERE THE CONCERN BECOMES TO WHAT EXTENT CAN SEE SAVE STEP IN TO ENSURE THAT STUDENT VETERANS HERE IN CALIFORNIA PROTECTED AND TO WHAT EXTENT THE DEPARTMENT AT ARMS FAIRS WILL ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN? I BELIEVE THAT THERE IS REASONABLE OPPORTUNITIES FOR OUR STATE LEGISLATURE TO INSURE THAT SEE SAFE IS ABLE TO HAVE THE AUTHORITY THEY NEED. TO DO TO STEP UP AND PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF THOSE WHO HAVE STEPPED UP TO PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF THEIR FELLOW CITIZENS. FINALLY IN CONCLUSION -- I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT AND THAT THEY WERE HAVING THIS HEARING TODAY I APPRECIATE YOUR INTEREST IN THIS TOPIC. I CAN'T EXPRESS TO YOU ENOUGH HOW HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO SIT WITH THE STUDENT VETERANS WHO HAS DONE EVERYTHING WE WOULD WANT THEM TO DO -- SERVE THEIR COUNTRY HONORABLY ARE ATTEMPTING TO MAKE A SUCCESSFUL TRANSITION TO CIVILIAN LIFE ONLY TO FIND OUT -- THAT THEY WERE DEFRAUDED BY SCHOOL THAT TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THEM. SAW AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE A QUICK BUCK OFF THE BACKS OF VETERANS AT THE EXPENSE OF THE AMERICAN TAXPAYER. I THANK YOU FOR YOUR FOR YOUR TIME YOUR TENSION AND IF THERE'S ANY QUESTIONS I CAN ANSWER I'D BE HAPPY TO SEND. I'D LIKE TO ASK A QUESTION WE WE HEARD FROM VETERANS DIRECTLY -- I THINK IT BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS. A COUPLE WEEKS AGO AND WE HEARD. PRETTY HORRENDOUS STORIES ABOUT HOW VETERANS HAD BEEN -- IN MY ESTIMATE ALMOST -- DEFRAUDED -- IN. BY SOME OF THESE -- BAD ACTORS -- WHAT MORE AND HOW? CAN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHAT CAN WE DO -- TOOK. TO GUIDE -- VETERANS TO TO THE MOST APPROPRIATE. FOR THE BEST DECISIONS THAT THEY CAN MAKE. AND GUIDE THEM AWAY FROM SOME OF THE THE BAD ACTORS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH GERMANY YEAH THAT'S A WONDERFUL QUESTION I THINK THE I THINK ONE THING THAT THAT IS A VERY CONCRETE WAY THE STATE LEGISLATURE COULD DO IS THERE IS A PACKAGE OF SEVEN BILLS PENDING. BEFORE THE ASSEMBLY THAT DIRECT WE SEEK TO CLOSE A VARIETY OF LOOPHOLES THAT HAVE BEEN CAUSING TROUBLE -- FOR STUDENTS -- RELATED TO GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT RELATED TO ANTI KICKBACK PROVISIONS -- A NUMBER OF OTHER KIND A HOST OF OTHER DIFFERENT ISSUES. AND I THINK THOSE ARE IMPORTANT I THINK THOSE ARE WAYS IN WHICH THE STATE CAN STEP IN UNDER THE PRINCIPLES OF FEDERALISM AND ENSURE THAT IF THE DEPARTMENT VETERANS AFFAIRS IS NOT GOING TO DO ITS ROLE IN PROTECTING STUDENT VETERANS. THAT CALIFORNIA'S STATE APPROVING AGENCY HAS THE AUTHORITY TO DO SO -- I THINK THAT OUR STATE APPROVING AGENCY IS IS WILLING AND ABLE TO PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF STUDENT AT ARMS THEY'RE I THINK THEY'RE UNDER QUITE FRANKLY I THINK THE UNDER RESOURCE I THINK THEY COULD DO I THINK THEY DO A LOT -- FOR THE BUDGET THAT THEY HAVE AND THEIR FUNDING GENERALLY COMES FROM A CONTRACT WITH THE DEPARTMENT AT ARMS AFFAIRS BUT IF THEY HAD MORE RESOURCES I BELIEVE PERSONALLY THAT THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO DO MORE ON THE AFGHAN VETERANS BY DO THINK -- RIGHT NOW IT'S WE GET QUITE A BANG FOR THE BUCK FOR WHAT THEY DO HAVE SO I THINK THOSE ARE TWO CONCRETE WAYS WOULD BE EXPAND RESOURCE FOR C. SAVE. AND THEN ALSO -- ENSURING THAT THOSE BILLS PASSED LEGISLATURE. THANK YOU. I HAVE A COUPLE OF TWENTY TWO CAN YOU HEAR ME [inaudible] OKAY OF SO WE'VE HAD A LONG HISTORY WITH THE GI BILL AND YOU'RE SORT OF DESCRIBING UPS AND DOWNS WHAT ARE THE OVER THE HISTORY OF THE BILL WHAT ARE THE REGULATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN. EVEN TO BE MOST EFFECTIVE THAT -- STOPPING THE EXPLOITATION OF VETERANS. THE ONE THING I SEE LOOKS OR I THINK MADE QUITE A DIFFERENCE WAS EVEN IN BACK TO THE ORIGINAL GI BILL. THE THE CONGRESS IMPOSE REQUIREMENTS THAT NO MORE THAN A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF THE STUDENT POPULATION AT A GIVEN SCHOOL BE STUDENT VETERANS -- SO SIMILAR I THINK THOSE TYPES OF REGULATIONS WORK BECAUSE IT REQUIRES THE SCHOOL TO ENSURE THAT IT'S ATTRACTING A DIVERSE GROUP OF STUDENTS TO THE INSTITUTION. AND THAT SOME OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE ATTENDING ARE ARE PAYING OUT OF POCKET SO FOR EXAMPLE -- REQUIREMENTS THAT NO MORE THAN A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF STUDENTS BE VETERANS OR THAT NO MORE THAN A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF THE INSTITUTIONS REVENUE BEAST DIRECTLY FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SO FOR EXAMPLE. RIGHT NOW IS A FOR PROFIT SCHOOL COULD NOT DRIVE MORE THAN 90% OF ITS REVENUE FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THEORETICALLY IT REALLY THAT'S TITLE FOR MONEY. AND THERE'S A HUGE LOOPHOLE AND THAT AND THAT LOOPHOLE IS THE GI BILL IT DOESN'T COUNT ON THE 90% FEDERAL MONEY SIDE OF LEDGER ACCOUNTS AS IF SOMEBODY'S PAYING OUT OF POCKET. AND THE PROBLEM WITH THAT SPECIFIC REGULATION LEUPOLD HIS THAT. IT THEN PUT A HUGE TARGET ON THE BACKS OF VETERANS IT MAKES IT SO THAT BETTER INS BECOME -- SOMEONE THAT IF A RECRUITER CAN BRING IN ONE VETERAN THEY COULD THEN BRING AND NINE OTHER NON VETERANS IF THEY WERE CAP UNDER THE NINETY TEN RULE. AND ONE OF THE PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT THAT IS UP FOR CONSIDERATION NOW IS A CALIFORNIA SPECIFIC WAY TO CLOSE THAT NINETY TEMPLE SO I THINK THOSE TYPES REGULATIONS ARE IMPORTANT [inaudible] AND ALSO. YOU HEAD OF MENTIONED EARLIER THAT WHEN THE BENEFITS FROM THE MOST GENEROUS IS WHEN YOU HAVE THE MOST EXPLOITATION. AND WHEN THEY CHECK -- BENEFITS WERE LESS GENEROUS YOU SAW THAT DECREASE WHAT. WHAT TYPE OF PERIOD ARE WE IN RIGHT NOW? THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION I THINK RIGHT NOW WE'RE IN A GENEROUS CARE AND I THINK THAT'S GREAT I THINK I THINK THE PROBLEM IS THAT -- WITH THIS GREAT BENEFIT YOU HAVE INDIVIDUALS BY UNSCRUPULOUS ACTORS WHO SEE THAT AS A TARGET AWAY TO DERIVE INCOME QUITE FRANKLY. SO I THINK WE'RE IN A I THINK ANY VETERANS ARE VERY HAPPY WITH POSTED ELEVEN YEAH I DO I THINK THEY THEY ARE THEY ARE APPRECIATIVE OF THE SUPPORT OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND ENSURING THAT THEY MAKE THAT SUCCESSFUL TRANSITION -- AND I THINK IT'S NECESSARY -- BUT BUT I THINK AT THE SAME TIME WE MAKE SURE WE HOLD THE BAD ACTORS TO ACCOUNT SO THAT THOSE BETTER IS ABLE TO USE THOSE BENEFITS THE WAY THEY WERE INTENDED. RIGHT THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRAZIER. THANK YOU AND THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TODAY [inaudible] YOUR SERVICE. SECONDS -- THIS LEGISLATIVE SESSION THIRTEEN FOURTEEN I INTRODUCED A BILL TO ADDRESS THIS EXACT ISSUE -- AB. TWENTY NINETY NINE AND WE'RE SUPPOSED TO PROTECT THE VETERANS FROM PREDATORY PRACTICES -- AND ALSO MAKE ACCOUNTABLE THE COOLER DEFAULT RATE -- AT A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE AS THEY WOULDN'T QUALIFY. FOR FOR THE THE GI BILL OR ARTICLE THIRTY ONE MONIES. WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THAT. WELL I THINK IT'S VERY POOR THESE LEGISLATION -- ACTUALLY CAME UP HERE AND INTESTINE FAVOR OF EDITION TIME SO THAT'S RIGHT SIR -- I THINK IT'S A MORE IT SEEMS LIKE WE'RE IN A PERPETUAL -- FORGET ME NOT FORGET ME YOU KNOW KIND OF A WHEEL AND AND I'M NOT. ARE WE DOING THINGS ARE JUST ARE NOT BEING. ADDRESSED IN AND IT ADOPTED OR ARE WE GOING TO GO TO A FOUR YEAR CYCLE AND SAY. THAT -- YEAH IT'S NOT WORKING STILL. I MEAN. WHAT WILL YOU KNOW LEGISLATURE'S TRYING TO IT TO JUSTIN AND AND? DO THE STUFF AND WHERE ARE WHERE'S THE WHERE'S THE MISSING. COMPONENT WHEN WE'RE DOING THIS LEGISLATION IS SUPPOSED TO ADDRESS THIS STUFF. IT'S A GREAT QUESTION I THINK. I THINK THE PREVIOUS LEGISLATION DID MAKE A DIFFERENCE AND I THINK TO SOME OF WHAT I THINK IS GOING ON HERE IS YOU HAVE -- CERTAIN ACTORS WITHIN THE FOR PROFIT SECTOR WHO SPEND AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY. ON LAWYERS -- WHO ARE ABLE TO FIND WAYS AROUND THESE REGULATIONS SO WHEN YOU LOOK HISTORICALLY WHAT YOU SEE IS? IT BECOMES ALMOST CYCLICAL GOING WAY BACK TO THE ORIGINAL GI BILL WHERE IT DAY THERE WERE ABUSES AND AND CONGRESS IN THAT CONTEXT STEPPED IN. TO SOLVE SOME OF THOSE AND THEN THINGS SETTLE DOWN A LITTLE BIT AND THEN THEY POP BACK UP IN SO I THINK THAT'S PART OF WHAT'S GOING ON HERE IS YOU HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE FINDING DEVIOUS WAYS AROUND IT. ALTHOUGH I DO THINK IT'S MAKING A DIFFERENCE -- THE THE OVERALL PERCENTAGE OF STUDENTS ENROLLING IN SOME OF THE WORST SCHOOLS -- HAS DECREASED SOME OF THESE SCHOOLS HAVE GONE OUT OF BUSINESS WHICH WHILE CERTAINLY DEVASTATING INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE THERE AT THAT TIME -- IN THE LONG RUN I THINK IT'S GOOD YOU KNOW WE DON'T HAVE STUDENTS GOING TO SOME OF THE WORST ACTORS FOR EXAMPLE CORINTHIAN OR I TT OR EDUCATION CORPORATION OF AMERICA SO I DO THINK IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE SIR -- I THINK IT'S JUST A MATTER OF WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO PULL LONG. AND THEN ALSO JUST AS A VERY BRIEF OUR I THINK PART OF THE PROBLEM IS WE SAW SOME VERY IMPORTANT PROGRESS LEADING UP TO TWENTY SIXTEEN ON THIS ISSUE. AND THEN THE DEPARTMENT EDUCATION ROLL BACK MANY OF THOSE EFFORTS -- HAD TO FEDERAL LEVEL AND SO AS A RESULT OF THAT -- THERE'S BEEN NEW SPACE FOR SOME OF THOSE WHO WHO WANT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF BETTER STOP RATED. IN AND DURING THAT PERIOD MANAGER YOU KNOW I DID A LOT OF EXTENSIVE TRAVELING TO THE FOR PROFIT COLLEGES IN USERNAME SOME OF THE THE SUSPECT PLAYERS. IN THE PREDATORY PRACTICES BUT THERE ARE SEVERAL THAT DO HAVE THE BEST INTENTION OF OF OF THE VETERANS AND HEART I'M ACTUALLY OR YOU KNOW MAKING -- STRIDES IN SO I DON'T WANT IS COMING OFF IS IS THERE WERE ALL ONE SIDED AND EVERYBODY'S BAD THERE WERE ONES. ONCE THERE WERE INSTITUTIONS THAT WERE ACTUALLY GOING ABOVE AND BEYOND ALSO I WOULD LIKE THAT TO BE RECOGNIZE ALSO BECAUSE THEY ARE MAY KING THE EFFORT. TO ADVANCE OUR VETERANS IN TWOS YOU KNOW SUCCESS. SO WE JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE ACKNOWLEDGING THAT. ASSEMBLY MEMBER VOEPEL PROFESSOR MOST. VERY GOOD WORK YOU'RE DOING. IS YOU ARE SPOT ON IN. NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT I LEFT THE MILITARY. IT WAS A VERY VERY MURKY AREA. BECAUSE YOU'LL BE APPROACHED AS A VETERAN -- I HAD A HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION SO YOU WANT TO GET SOME COLLEGE. BUT NOW MANY VETERANS 80% WERE LISTED. YOU MIGHT HAVE A WIFE. A SPOUSE. YOU MIGHT HAVE -- CHILDREN THAT YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR NOT EVEN BE MARRIED YOU MIGHT BE A SINGLE PARENT. SO THERE'S A WHOLE GAMUT THERE. SO PART OF WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT COLLEAGUES. IS MANY TIMES VETERANS HAVE THEIR BACK AGAINST THE WALL. IN ORDER TO TAKE CARE OF THEIR OBLIGATIONS. THEY'VE GOT TO GO UNDER THE GI BILL ANY WHICH WAY THEY CAN. AND MANY TIMES ARE NOT. PARTICULARLY -- SMART ABOUT IT. I WAS OFFERED TO BECOME A HELICOPTER PILOT. FOR A GAZILLION DOLLARS. I WAS OFFERED -- ALL SORTS OF DIFFERENT WEIRD. COURSES FROM PRIVATE SCHOOLS BUT ON THE OTHER SIDE THE COOLING. I WAS OFFERED SOME VERY GOOD COURSES THEY COUNTED THAT HAD CREDIT SO. MY ASSOCIATE BEST FRAZIER IS SPOT ON THERE TOO SO WHAT I'M LOOKING AT IS LEGISLATION THAT WE CAN DO. NUMBER ONE THE FIRST LINE OF DEFENSE IN MY OPINION IS THE COUNTY VETERANS OFFICES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA FUND THEM. SUPPORT THEM BECAUSE THE COUNTY VETERANS OFFICES WILL BE VALUE WAY. EACH VETERANS THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE THERE FOR IN A VERY GOOD AT IT. IN MOST CASES -- I WOULD LIKE TO SEE LEGISLATION. THAT WOULD GIVE EXTER. AUTHORITY TO THE COUNTY VETERANS OFFICES THAT WOULD BE GOOD. ESPECIALLY TO EVALUATE THE DIFFERENT COURSES. AND THAT WAY WE'RE NOT ONE SIZE FITS ALL WE CAN FIT EACH COUNTY BECAUSE CERTAIN COUNTIES HAVE A PREPONDERANCE OF NAVY MARINE VETERANS OTHER COUNTIES HAVE AIRFORCE OTHERS ARE ARMY. ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION VETERANS IN CALIFORNIA ANOTHER THING I'D LIKE TO SEE BECAUSE WE ONLY HAVE THIRTY SIX MONTHS OF GI BENEFITS. IS A TIME LINE. FOR A DEGREE A MATRIX BECAUSE RIGHT NOW VETERANS THAT I TALKED. TO WILL TAKE MORE THAN TWELVE CREDITS. SO THEY CAN STRETCH OUT THEIR BENEFITS BECAUSE ONCE AGAIN THIS ISN'T JUST TO GET A DEGREE. FOR MANY VETERANS THIS IS SURVIVAL. THIS IS THE CHECKED THEY GET THIS IS PAYING THE RENT. THEY'RE TELLING THEIR SPOUSES HEY I SERVE THE GOVERNMENT'S GOING TO TAKE CARE OF ME THEN THEY GET RIPPED OFF AND EXPLOITED IN A PRIVATE SECTOR BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT VERY SOPHISTICATED I WASN'T. IT TOOK ME FORTY YEARS TO GET SOPHISTICATED MY WIFE STILL DISAGREES. SO THOSE ARE MY COMMENTS. THANK YOU THANK YOU. ANY OTHER ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. NO. IF NOT. I WILL THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND LET -- SURE -- WOULD CONTINUE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. APPRECIATE THOSE -- COMMENTS IN ON FOR OUR SECOND PANEL WE HAVE A STATE OVERSIGHT THE STATE OF OVERSIGHT REGULATION AND FEDERAL GUIDANCE. AND WE HAVE A TWO SPEAKERS DR MICHAEL MERION -- THE JUNIOR CHIEF FOR THE BUREAU OF PRIVATE POSTSECONDARY EDUCATION.

HE IS A CALIFORNIA GATEKEEPER FOR PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS ENSURING THAT SCHOOLS MEET THE MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS AND UP HOLD THE ACADEMIC STANDARDS. BEFORE STE SPEAKING SPECIFICALLY ABOUT HOW BB PROVIDE SUPPORT AND OVERSIGHT TO VETERANS I LIKE TO BRIEFLY DISCUSS THE EXCITING EFFORTS HAPPENING WITHIN THE BUREAU WITHIN MY SHORT TIME OF THE YEAR AND A HALF. IN LATE NINETEEN IN LATE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN BE VIA UNDERWENT A RESTRUCTURING TO CHANGES CULTURE AND STRIVE FOR ABSOLUTE STUDENT PROTECTION. AS A PART OF THIS RESTRUCTURING B. B. AS MAY RE CLASSIFICATIONS WITH VARIOUS UNITS AND RECENTLY HIRED A SPECIAL SUPERVISOR SPECIAL INVESTIGATOR WITH SPECIFIC EXPERIENCE IN COMPLAIN HANDLING ENFORCEMENT TO LEAD THE ENFORCEMENT UNIT. IN ADDITION TO CREATING UNAPPROVED APPS YOU IN ADDITION TO ALSO CREATING THE UNAPPROVED ACTIVITY UNITS TO HANDLE COMPLAINTS RELATED TO UNAPPROVED ACTIVITIES. AS A RESULT OF THESE EFFORTS ALONG WITH THE EFFORTS OF DCA IN THE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE LEGISLATOR IN NOVEMBER. THE BUREAU PUT INTO PLACE ACTIONABLE REASONABLE APPROACH IS TO IMPROVE THE ENFORCEMENT UNIT AND SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED THE ULTIMATELY EMULATING BP'S COMPLAINT BACK LOW. WE JOINTLY CREATED A BB ENFORCEMENT TASK FORCE TO SPECIFICALLY ADDRESS PPVS ENFORCEMENT CHALLENGE. THE BE REINFORCEMENT TASK FORCE HAS FOCUSED ON FOR BIG AREAS. ONE ADDRESSING THE LEADERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT GAPS WITHIN THE BUREAU. TO INSTITUTIONAL A PLAN TO REDUCE THE HIGH NUMBERS TO COMPLAINTS ORDERED AT THREE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE DAYS. CREATING CLEAR EFFECTIVE COMPLAINT PROCESSING TIMELINE SINGLES. AND LASTLY ALSO AS WELL AS A NEW INTAKE PROCESS. IN THE LAST FOUR MONTHS THE ENFORCEMENT TASK FORCE HAS DONE SOME GREAT WORK. IN THE LAST YEAR AND A HALF WE CONTINUE TO THAT PROGRESS. AND I CAN TELL YOU. AS OF TODAY. WE HAVE FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY FOR MINE COMPLAINTS IN THE LAST FOUR MONTHS THAT HAVE DROPPED IN HALF ORIGINALLY IT WAS ONE THOUSAND AND FIFTY EIGHT IN THESE LAST FOUR MONTHS THAT I'VE BEEN THERE IN THE DEVELOPING THIS TEAM WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO CUT THAT IN HALF.

AND STAFF TO ENSURE THE AMAZING WORK CONTINUES. NOW AS IT RELATES TO SPECIFIC VETERANS STUDENTS IN EDUCATION THE BUREAU'S OFFICE OF STUDENT ASSISTANT AND RELEASE DOES PROVIDE SPECIFIC ASSISTANCE AND OVERSIGHT FOR THE STUDENT POPULATIONS. AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE COMMITTEE TO UNDERSTAND THAT THIS AREA IS ONLY BEEN IN EFFECT A YEAR AND A HALF AND HAS DONE SOME OUTSTANDING WORK. SPECIFICALLY TO THE EDUCATION CODE ESTABLISHING NO SORRY AS A PRIMARY POINT OF CONTACT TO ADDRESS THE NEED FOR PRIVATE POSTSECONDARY EDUCATION STUDENTS WORKING IN CONSULTATION WITH VARIOUS STATE AND FEDERAL AGENCIES INCLUDING THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERAN AFFAIRS -- SARS THE ACTIVE PARTNER WITH CAL VETS CALIFORNIA TRANSITION ASSISTANCE PROGRAM CAL TECH.

CALVET HAS BEGIN HEALTH FELIPE HAD A CAL TROUT HAS BE BEEN A HELPFUL PARTNER IN CONNECTING WITH THE RIGHTS OF PEOPLE TO MAKE OPPORTUNITIES COME TO FRUITION. B. B. AND STAR STRIVE TO PROVIDE AS MUCH INFORMATION TO DISCHARGING SERVICE MEMBERS IN ORDER TO HELP THEM MAKE INFORMED EDUCATIONAL DECISIONS AS THEY MOVE TO THE NEXT STEPS IN THEIR CAREERS IN LIFE LIKE MY GRANDPARENTS. IN THE FOREIGN UNFORTUNATE CASE AN EVENT THAT A SCHOOL DOES CLOSE ALSO ARE PARTNERS WITH CALIFORNIA STATE PPROVING AGENCY OF VETERANS SERVICE -- EDUCATION KOUSEI IN CLOSE SCHOOL OUT REACH WE TRY TO COLLABORATE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE WITH CALVET BEFORE OR QUICKLY THEREAFTER WHEN A SCHOOL CLOSES.

SO THAT THEY MAY CONTINUE THEIR EDUCATION ON ANOTHER INSTITUTION. FINALLY DCA IS FOCUSED MORE BROADLY ON ADDRESSING THE IMPROVING THE DEPARTMENTS INTERACTION WITH VETERANS AND ONE OF THIS YEAR'S PROJECTS FROM THE DC A FUTURE LEADERSHIP PROGRAM WAS FOCUSING ON INCREASED INCREASING THE COLLABORATION WITH CALVET TO IMPROVE THE RESOURCES FOR VETERANS STUDENTS. AND I'M PROUD TO SAY THE PERSON THAT'S LEADING THAT PART OF IT IS OUT OF THE B. B. B. AND IT'S ACTUALLY HERE IN THE CROWD WITH US TODAY. THE FINAL ITEM THAT I LIKE TO ADDRESS IN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BE BEING CALVET. SINCE COMING ON BOARD A YEAR AND A HALF AGO I'VE BEEN FOCUSING ON IMPROVING THE RELATIONSHIP WITH VARIOUS.

AS THE BUREAU CHIEF THAT'S MY GOAL AND MY FULLY AND I'M FULLY COMMITTED TO ENSURING THAT WE MEET THOSE AND PROTECT OUR CONSUMERS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I I A MESSED UP A LITTLE BIT ON BOTH INTERSECTIONS WHICH IS QUITE SOMETHING BUT I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT I HAVE -- MS JOHNSON'S FULL OF OF THE RESUME HERE SAYS ASSISTANT DEPUTY SECRETARY OF CAL THAT AND CHIEF OF POST SECONDARY -- EDUCATION FOR CC THAT'S CORRECT AND THAT I WAS GONNA GO WITH. AND AND I AM PROUD TO SAY MISS JOHNSON IS NOT WHILE SHE WORKS AT CALVET SHE IS AND WAS A FORMER EMPLOYEE OF THE BUREAU SO SHE KNOWS A LOT OF HISTORY AND WE'VE BEEN WORKING CLOSELY TOGETHER SINCE I ARRIVED ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF AGO. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME -- THIS ISSUE IS. CLOSED EVERYBODY'S HEART THAT'S IN HERE WE SEE A LOT THAT'S BEEN HAPPENING SO I JUST JUMP RIGHT INTO A LOT OF WHAT HAS ALREADY BEEN SPOKEN -- KINDA IS ALREADY IN THIS BUT I'M KIND OF READ SOME OF THIS AND AND KIND OF SEE IF I CAN HELP YOU. GAME IN THE M. S. PERSPECTIVE ON WHERE I'M COMING FROM. THE CALIFORNIA STATE APPROVING AGENCY FOR VETERANS EDUCATION AS THE TORTILLAS PRESCRIBED UNDER TITLE. THIRTY EIGHT SECTIONS THIRTY SIX SEVENTEEN THIRTY SIX SEVENTY NINE AND CALIFORNIA EDUCATION CODE THANKS -- TO ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRAZIER AND SIXTY SEVEN ONE HUNDRED AND THREE SIXTY SEVEN ONE OH FOUR SCHOOLS ARE THE TRAIN OF MINERAL VETERANS MUST OBTAIN APPROVAL FROM C. SAVING DEMONSTRATE AND MAINTAIN COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAW AT ALL TIMES. SEE SAVE OPERATES UNDER THE CONTRACT WITH THE US DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS. WHERE BY THE VA REIMBURSES THE STATE FOR ADMINISTRATION OF THE CONTRACT AND ALL EXPENSES INCURRED BY DELEGATED STAFF? SO I WORK I HAVE A STAFF OF TEN PROFESSIONAL STAFF AND TO ADMINISTRATIVE STAFF -- WE OVERSEE APPROXIMATELY ELEVEN HUNDRED PUBLIC. PRIVATE NON PROFIT FOR PROFIT ACCREDITED AND AN ACCREDITED SCHOOLS COLLEGES UNIVERSITIES AS WELL AS J. T. AN APPRENTICESHIP FACILITIES. AND TRAINING FACILITIES. THE SCHOOLS OFFER ALL TYPES OF DEGREES CERTIFICATES DIPLOMAS VOCATIONAL EMPLOYMENT TRAINING DESIGNED TO HELP VETERANS TRANSITION FROM MILITARY TO CIVILIAN LIFE. FEDERAL LAW REQUIRES THAT SI SE MONITORS SCHOOLS TO ENSURE THE SCHOOLS COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE STANDARDS AND REQUIREMENTS. THIS IS CRITICAL TO ADEQUATELY AND EFFECTIVELY PROTECTING VETERANS AND THEIR EARNED BENEFITS. WHEN THEY'RE SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE OF WAS INSTITUTION NOT MEETING THE STANDARDS OR REQUIREMENTS FEDERAL LAW REQUIRES THE SAVE TO SUSPEND FUTURE ENROLLMENT OF VETERANS FOR UP TO SIXTY DAYS ALLOWING THE INSTITUTION? AND OPPORTUNITIES CORRECT THE DEFICIENCIES. HOWEVER. THE TV A CONTRACT PERFORMANCE REQUIRES CCA'S PRIORITY TO BE THAT OF AUDITING PAYMENTS FOR GI BILL. AND NOT EDUCATION [inaudible] YES. HOWEVER SEE SAVE HAS TRIED TO INSTITUTE MEASURES TO ALSO MEET THE STATE'S PRIORITY. OF ENSURING THAT VETERANS HAVE ACCESS TO QUALITY EDUCATION AND TRAINING. IN SO DOING OVER THE LAST COUPLE YEARS SEIZE HAS EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT PUSH BACK FROM THE DV. EIGHT THE V. A.'S RESPONSE HAS BEEN TO ISSUE POLICY ADVISORY IS IN OPINIONS ACCUSING SEE SAVE OF CONTRACT NON COMPLIANCE. AND ULTIMATELY THREATENING TO DISCONTINUE THE CONTRACT WITH COLOR TO CONTRACT WITH KIND. CALIFORNIA ALTOGETHER. THIS MEANS THAT WE HAD TO SHIFT OUR PRIORITIES. ANOTHER CHALLENGE HAS BEEN THE THREAT OF FILING OF CIVIL LITIGATION ON BEHALF OF SCHOOLS BECAUSE THE CEASING SUSPENSION. OF ALTHOUGH SEE SAVE HAS BEEN SUCCESSFULLY DEFENDED BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE DEVIATES RESPONSE. HAS BEEN TO INSTITUTE POLICIES THAT PUT VETERANS IN THEIR EDUCATION BENNETT AND BENEFITS AT RISK. FOR EXAMPLE. LAST YEAR'S THE TH. THE SAVE SUSPENDED A NUMBER OF OUT OF STATE COLLEGES. THAT FAILED TO DEMONSTRATE IN ADVANCE CALLED -- THAT THEY MET THE REQUIREMENTS FOR APPROVAL UNDER TITLE. THIRTY EIGHT BECAUSE OF A NUMBER OF REASONS AYE AYE. I HAVE LISTED THEM ALL HERE BUT THEY'RE JUST TOO MANY -- TO MENTION. IT'S BASICALLY ABOUT THE WAY THEY DO BUSINESS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT WAS WHAT THE SUSPENSIONS WERE ABOUT. IN RESPONSE TO SEE SAY SUSPENSION OF THESE OUT OF STATE COLLEGES EASIEST TV A ISSUED. A LEVIN [inaudible] ADVISORIES. MULTIPLE EMAILS AND LETTERS. TELLING US TO CEASE AND DESIST IN EVERY WHICH WAY POSSIBLE AND THEN THE ULTIMATE RESULT WAS TO THREATEN AGAIN. FOR CALIFORNIA IN ITS TOTALITY TO LOSE THE CONTRACT. THROUGH THESE COME IN COMMUNICATIONS DEVIATE CLARIFIED ITS POSITION REGARDING THE INTERPRETATION APPLICATION ENFORCEMENT OF TITLE THIRTY EIGHT IT'S PERFORMANCE EXPECTATIONS IN ORDER FOR D. ABA. TO CONDENSE CONTINUE TO CONTRACT WITH CALIFORNIA AND SEE SAFE. TO ENSURE DV A CONTRACT COMPLIANCE SEE SAVED WITHDREW THE SUSPENSIONS AND REINSTATED THE SCHOOLS SCHOOL APPROVALS AND NO LONGER ENFORCES THE SAME STANDARDS AND REQUIREMENTS. ALL OF THIS PRACTICE LOSE CALIFORNIA VETERANS AT RISK. THE STATE WOULD LOSE THE TV A CONTRACT YOU SEE SAY WERE TO CONTINUE ITS PREVIOUS ACTIONS. THUS LEAVING VETERANS AT GREATER RISK. TITLE THIRTY EIGHT PROHIBITS DEFEAT DEVIATE FROM EXERCISING CONTROL OVER THE ESSAY A AND AUTHORIZES THE STATE TO DEVELOP AND APPLY AND FORCE ADDITIONAL REASONABLE CRITERIA WITHIN THE STATE. HOWEVER THE DV EIGHT CONTRACT COMPEL SEE SAVE TO COMPLY WITH THE VA POLICY ADVISORIES AND GUIDANCE. AND LIMITS THE ABILITY TO PROTECT CALIFORNIA VETERANS AND OTHER TITLE THIRTY EIGHT BENEFICIARIES. AS AND MISTER MOVE HAS SAID OF THAT -- PREVIOUSLY TESTIFIED THE SA AY'S CONDUCT COMPLIANCE SURVEYS. FIFTY TWO STATE APPROVING AGENCIES ONE IN EACH STATE AND IN SOME STATES HAVE -- TO AND WE ALL DO BASICALLY THE SAME THING HOWEVER -- WHAT WE'RE CHECKING IS THE MONEY? NOT THE QUALITY OF EDUCATION NOT IF THEY ARE MEETING THE STANDARDS OF THE LAW. NOT IF THEY ARE OFFERING ANYTHING REMOTELY CLOSE TO WHAT THEIR ADVERTISING THE GOAL OF THE V. A.'S CONTRACT IS TO MONITOR AND MAINTAIN THE MONEY. THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WHAT THEY ARE PAYING TO THE STUDENT AND TO THE VETERANS. IS RIGHT CORRECTMEANING THERE ARE NO OVER PAYMENT OR UNDERPAYMENT THERE ARE SINCE THERE'S NOTHING ELSE THAT THAT. COMPLAINTS SURVEY DOES. NOTABLY SEE SAYS EFFORTS OF THE LAST FEW YEARS TO HOLD SCHOOLS ACCOUNTABLE FOR COMPLIANCE WITH STATE AND FEDERAL LAW ADVERTISING CLAIMS AND ACCREDITING STANDARDS HAS DRAWN NATIONAL ATTENTION. C. SAVES ACTIONS IN CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN THE SUBJECT OF VARIOUS VARIOUS NEWS AND REPORTS ARTICLES LITIGATION HEARINGS AND LEGISLATIVE CHANGES. HOWEVER ABSENT SPECIFIC CALIFORNIA LAW GOVERNING OVERSIGHT OF VETERAN EDUCATION. SEE SAY WILL CONTINUE TO BE CHALLENGE WAS STRIKING THE RIGHT BALANCE BETWEEN FOR FILLING DEVIATES CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS. AND MEETING CALIFORNIA'S PERFORMANCE EXPECTATIONS FOR THE PROTECTION AND PRESERVATION OF VETERAN IN THAILAND. TO QUALITY EDUCATION AND THEIR GI BILL THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER -- MEDINA AND HAVE SOME QUESTIONS YES I I HAVE QUESTIONS FOR EACH OF THE PANELS AND STARTING WITH -- DOCTOR MERION -- I'D LIKE TO KNOW HOW FREQUENTLY HOW REGULARLY THE BUREAU OF PRIVATE POSTSECONDARY EDUCATION -- MEETS WITH THE CALIFORNIA STATE APPROVING AGENCY FOR VETERANS EDUCATION. RIGHT SO GREAT QUESTION I THINK. I'VE BEEN THERE YEAR AND A HALF OF THE AND A LITTLE BIT OVER A YEAR AND A HALF. AND I WANT TO SAY IT AGAIN I'VE HAD I DON'T KNOW. FOUR FIVE CONVERSELY OAK MEETINGS THREE OR FOUR MEETINGS IN MULTIPLE CONVERSATION. IN THE YEAR AND A HALF YEAR TO HAVE BEEN UNDER IS SORT OF YOU BEEN CHEAP. YEAH ALL RIGHT AND CONTINUED. DR MARION DO YOU FEEL THAT THE GIRL. PRIVATE POSTSECONDARY EDUCATION -- IS EXPLICITLY -- PART OF THEIR MISSION IS VETERANS OUTREACH. ABSOLUTELY I THINK IT'S NOT ONLY VETERANS I THINK IS ALL STUDENTS ABSOLUTELY BUT BUT INCLUDING BETTER SURE NO QUESTION. RIGHT AND HOW IS THE RE ORGANIZATION -- IMPACTED I THINK YOU ALLUDED TO IT -- YOU MENTION OF THE RE ORGANIZATION OF THE THE BUREAU -- HOW'S THAT IMPACTED YOUR ABILITY TO CLOSE THAT THESE LONG STANDING. OPEN INVESTIGATIONS -- SO BRING IT ON THE ENFORCEMENT TASK FORCE WHICH I TALKED ABOUT OVER THE LAST FOUR MONTHS HE'S BEEN POWERFUL IN NOT ONLY RESTRUCTURING FOR ENFORCEMENT UNIT BUT THE WHOLE BUREAU. AND I THINK BEING ABLE TO BRING PEOPLE IN FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION THAT AND DO THIS WORK EVERY DAY AND HELPING US WITH OUR PROCESS AND WE DEVELOPING A MAKING A LITTLE BIT CLEANER AND CLEARER. I THINK IT'S BEEN SHOOT YOU CAN SEE THE NUMBERS RIGHT SO WE WENT FROM TWELVE HUNDRED OR A HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT IN DECEMBER AND NOW WE'RE JUST ABOVE. FIVE HUNDRED AND I THINK WITH US BEING ABLE TO BRING IN NEW STAFF THAT UNDERSTAND THIS WORK A LITTLE BIT DEEPER THAN -- I WOULD SAY THE AVERAGE IS BEEN BENEFICIAL TO HELP INFORM OUR STAFF AND ENGAGE THEM IN A WAY THAT MAKES US DO I THINK BETTER OUTREACH BUT ALSO BETTER INVESTIGATION. AND THEN IN THE ONES THAT YOU WERE ABLE TO CLOSE DO YOU HAVE A SENSE OF HOW MANY OF THOSE -- CASES THAT YOU WERE ABLE TO CLOSE -- INVOLVED VETERANS THAT UNFORTUNATELY I DON'T HAVE THAT NUMBER BUT I CAN GET BACK TO YOU OKAY CRUCIATE THAT. AND THEN I QUESTIONS -- TO SECRETARY JOHNSON WHAT WHAT WOULD YOU THINK WOULD BE AN IDEAL WORKING RELATIONSHIP WITH THE BUREAU FOR PRIVATE POSTSECONDARY EDUCATION HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE. AN IDEAL. RELATIONSHIP WITH. CAN I ANSWER THAT SHE CAN JUST COME BACK TO THE BUREAU. SORRY FROM RECRUITING. I I THINK THE BEST APPROACH WOULD BE FOR US TO COLLABORATE IN. INSURING THAT WHATEVER THE REQUIREMENTS ARE FOR THE STATE ARE BEING MET -- WHAT WE DO IT WOULD SEE SAVE IS WE WHAT WE WANT GRANT APPROVAL IF THE SCHOOL DOESN'T DEMONSTRATE COMPLIANCE FIRST? THAT'S IT AND SO THAT WILL TAKE SOME WORKING WITH -- THE BPP BECAUSE WHEN IT COMES TO YOUR RANTING AND INSTITUTION APPROVAL FOR TITLE THIRTY EIGHT ACCESS TO TURN TITLE THIRTY FUNDS. THE PREREQUISITE IS THAT THEY MUST BE APPROVED BY THE PIER FOR TWO YEARS. BEFORE THEY CAN EVEN APPLY TO US. SO -- BY THE TIME THE SCHOOL GETS TO US. THE HOPE IS THAT THEY'VE BEEN IN OPERATION OFFERING THEIR PROGRAMS OF EDUCATION AND DOING THAT SUCCESSFULLY -- OUR APPROACH IS. IS DIFFERENT BECAUSE OF WITH THE VA REQUIRES -- BUT WORKING TOGETHER TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT'S BEING LOOKED AT BEFORE THE GRANT OF APPROVAL IS ADMINISTERED THIS IS THE BEST APPROACH. THANK YOU AND WHAT IS YOUR WORKING RELATIONSHIP. LIKE WITH PUBLIC AND INDEPENDENT NON NON PROFIT SCHOOLS. WELL WE DON'T REALLY IT. BUT WE DON'T REALLY HAVE A RELATIONSHIP. THAT -- EMPOWERS ONE OVER THE OTHER -- WHAT WE DO IS WE DO OUTREACH EFFORTS FOR EXAMPLE WE? HAVE -- TRAINING SESSIONS THAT WE ARE IMPLEMENTING SO THE INSTITUTIONS CAN COME ASK WHATEVER THE QUESTIONS ARE SO THAT WE CAN. ESTABLISH COMPLAINTS BEFORE THE SUBMIT AN APPLICATION SO AND WE DO THAT FOR ANY INSTITUTION WHETHER IT'S PUBLIC PRIVATE FOR PROFIT NONPROFIT ALL THE INSTITUTIONS ARE INVITED. TO TO BE INVOLVED IN THAT AND THEN DOES THE LACK OF COORDINATING ANTIQUE ENTITY MAKE YOUR JOB. MORE DIFFICULT TO DO. I THINK WHAT MAKES MY JOB THE MOST DIFFICULT OR THIS BUT FOR THE STAFF IS. THE CONTRACT THE CONTRACT THAT THAT IS -- BETWEEN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THE D. THE BETTER THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS. LIMITS OUR ABILITY TO DO ANYTHING OTHER THAN WHAT THEY CONTRACTORS TO DO. WITHOUT -- SPECIFIC STATE LAWS. THAT -- SAY WHAT WE CAN AND OVER WHAT THE STATE CALIFORNIA WANTS US TO DO WE MUST IT HERE TOO WHAT THEY REQUIRE US TO DO. THAT'S THE BIGGEST HURDLE. AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS WHEN -- THE CALIFORNIA STATE APPROVING AGENCY FOR VETERANS EDUCATIONS LEARNS THAT THERE IS A TROUBLING INFORMATION ABOUT A SCHOOL. IS THIS IS THIS INFORMATION REPORTED TO ANYONE. WHEN YOU MEAN IN ADVANCE TO US IF YOU [inaudible] FIND OUT [inaudible] ANYTHING. CONCERNING CONCERNING ANY DECISION YES OR FOR THE INSTITUTION. IS THAT INFORMATION SHARE. IT IS SHARED AND WITH WHOM WITH THE BUREAU -- RIGHT AND MY LAST QUESTION -- WHAT OUR STUDENTS VETERANS AND SERVICE MEMBERS? FOR ME AT LEAST AS IT RELATES TO CALVET AND SEE SAVE. THEIR ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRAZIER PUT THE LAW ON THE BOOKS AB TWENTY NINETY NINE THAT'S WHAT CODIFIED AND SEE SAVE IN LAW. UNFORTUNATELY WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT WHILE WE HAVE THE AUTHORITY. TO HAVE SCHOOLS APPLY TO US WHEN WE WERE IN LITIGATION WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT WE WERE APPLYING FEDERAL LAW BECAUSE THERE AREN'T ANY STATE LAWS. SO WE LACK THE SUPPORT LEGISLATIVELY MEANING WE HAVE NO LAWS TO DEFEND WHAT ACTIONS THAT WE TAKE OTHER THAN THE FEDERAL LAW. SO THEN THAT'S WHEN THE VA GETS TO COME IN AND SAY. YOU'RE NOT DOING THAT WITH OUR MONEY YOU'RE GOING TO DO COMPLIANCE OR RACE CHECK THE MONEY AUDIT THE STUDENTS. WE THEY ARE NOT PAYING FOR THEIR THIS IS HOW THEY COMMUNICATED TO US IS THAT THEY'RE NOT PAYING FOR THAT SERVICE AND SO WE HAVE THE LAW. BUT WE HAVE NO ENFORCEMENT OF THE LAW BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE STATE LAW. TO ENFORCE WHAT IT IS. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WANTS US TO DO. SO WERE CAUGHT. IN A CATCH TWENTY TWO YES THE WORK THAT WE DO WERE DESPERATELY TRYING -- TO INSURE THAT WE LOOK AT THINGS IN ADVANCE BUT THE ENFORCEMENT OF IT NOW HAS BEEN TAKEN AWAY FROM US THAT NEW POLICY ADVISORY THAT CAME OUT. FROM THE A AUGUST THIRTIETH BASICALLY SAYS -- THEY DON'T CARE. IF THE SCHOOLS BET GOOD BETTER INDIFFERENT WE ARE TO LISTEN TO ANY OTHER STATE NOT JUST THE BUREAU. ANY STATE FEDERAL -- COUNTY CITY APPROVING AGENCY OR ENTITY INCLUDING ACCREDITATION THAT MEANS THAT IF. THAT INTO T. WHATEVER THE ENTITY IS DOESN'T TAKE AN ACTION YOU CANNOT WHICH MEANS VETERANS ARE NOT BEING PROTECTED. AT ALL. THAT'S THE FOR THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER PETRIE-NORRIS. JUST COMING BACK TO IT I'M. A COMMENT THAT YOU MADE SO IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU THINK THERE ARE SOME SPECIFIC. PIECES OF LEGISLATION AND SOME STEPS THAT WE CAN TAKE WHICH WOULD STRENGTHEN YOUR ABILITY. TO HOLD THE SPOT ACTORS ACCOUNTABLE AND A SUPPORTER VETERANS CAN YOU ELABORATE YES I ALSO SEE SAID CURRENTLY HAS A A A REGULATION PACKET. THAT IS JUST BEEN INTRODUCED AN APRIL TWENTY EIGHTH SO IT'S GOING THROUGH THE PROCESS -- WHERE WE ESTABLISHED -- WHAT WE HOPE WOULD BE SUPPORTED BY -- EVERYONE IN CALIFORNIA. TO HELP US IN FORCE WHAT IT IS YOU REALLY HAVE SEEN US DO OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS WE WE DIDN'T DEVIATE FROM ANYTHING THAT WE HAVE DONE BEFORE IT MEANS THAT. IT WOULD HOLD SCHOOLS ACCOUNTABLE IN ADVANCE IT WOULD REQUIRE THAT THE INSTITUTION. THE THE FIRST PART OF ASSEMBLY MEMBERS OF THE FRESHEST BILL SAID THAT THEY MUST APPLY BUT THAT'S ALL IT SAID IS THAT THEY MUST APPLY TO ASK. SO WE WENT UP BEYOND THAT TO SAY BUT THESE ARE THE TH THE ADDITIONAL THINGS THAT NEED TO BE DONE THAT THEY HAVE TO DO THINGS THAT THEY HAVE TO REPORT TO US NEEDING TIME LINES IN THOSE CUT AT THOSE KINDS OF THINGS. THAT'S ALL THAT IN THERE SO THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO DO THESE THINGS. BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENS IS IS THE REASON THAT THE D. V. A.'S -- POLICIES AND PROCEDURE ARE IN THE POLICY ADVISORIES -- TRUMP STATE LAW IS BECAUSE THERE ISN'T ANY STATE LAW. TO ENFORCE SO THEY SAY YOU DO WHAT WE SAY BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE ANY STATE LAW OKAY. WELL THANK YOU FOR PUTTING OUT FOR IT AND YOU HAVE MY COMMITMENT TO YOU IS THAT WE WILL TAKE A VERY CLOSE LOOK AT THAT AND DO EVERYTHING THAT THEY CAN TO MAKE THAT A REALITY AND I DO HAVE -- A QUESTION AT DOCTOR MARION I THINK YOU MENTIONED THAT YOUR DEPARTMENT IS DEALT WITH HE SAID FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY NINE COMPLAINTS THE LAST FOUR MONTHS. WHICH WILL YOU SAID THAT'S HALF OF WHERE IT WAS STILL SEEMS LIKE AN AWFUL. LOT ABSOLUTELY YOU KNOW MY STAFF AND I AND OUR TEAM HAD HAVE HAD VERY CALM VERY IS CONVERSATIONS WHEN I FIRST CAME INTO BUREAUS AROUND. TWELVE HUNDRED AND UNDERSTANDING THAT YOU KNOW THERE'S SOMEBODY OUT THERE THAT NEED SOME ASSISTANCE AND WE WANT TO HELP THEM IN THE BEST WAY THAT WE CAN IN MAKING IT MORE PERSONAL UNDERSTANDING LIKE IF IT WAS ONE OF US OR ONE OF OUR FRIENDS OR ONE OF OUR FAMILY. MEMBERS AND OUR VETERANS AT A SERVICE COUNTRY EVEN HERE IN SOME OF THE STORIES THAT I'VE HEARD HERE TODAY. YOU KNOW OUR OFFICE AND WE WANT TO DO EVERYTHING THAT WE CAN TO IMPACT WHAT YOU WRITE A REMEMBER ALSO WHEN THE BUREAU CAME BACK INTO EXISTENCE IN TWO THOUSAND TEN IT WAS ALREADY A COMPLAINT BACKLOG OF OVER EIGHT HUNDRED COMPLAINTS. AND SO THEY'VE BEEN TRYING TO CATCH UP WITH THE LAST NINE YEARS AND SO LUCKILY WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO MAKE SOME ADJUSTMENTS IN THE LAST YEAR AND A HALF THAT HAVE BEEN TURNED INTO VERY POSITIVE THINGS BUT I CAN'T AGREE WITH YOU MORE FIVE HUNDRED AND NINETY NINE IS. TOO MANY ONE IS TOO MANY TO BE QUITE HONEST. RIGHT AND IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU AND YOUR TEAM OR SIGNING HIM. TIME AND TIME AND A LOT AND ENERGY AND DEALING WITH THIS YOU KNOW JUST TAKING A STEP BACK AGAIN ARE THERE THINGS THAT WE CAN DO. THAT WOULD ADDRESS SOME OF THE ROOT CAUSES OF THOSE OF THOSE ISSUES. GREAT QUESTION THANK YOU FOR ASKING THAT AND FOR ME I WOULD I'M OPEN TO ANY AND ALL OPPORTUNITIES THAT WILL ALLOW US. TO INCREASE OUR BELIEVES DO OUR JOB AT A HIGHER LEVEL AND HAVE MORE CONSUMER PROTECTION SO ANY BILLS THAT COME OUT IN REGARDS TO THAT TO SUPPORT US AND DO OUR JOB AT A HIGH LEVEL. I'M I'M FOR ABSOLUTELY. ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRAZIER THE MANAGER. SO YOU'D MENTIONED THAT YOU HAD AND I CAN'T THINK IN THOSE AYE AYE. I AM SO PLEASED THAT YOU'RE IN THIS POSITION AND AND THE PASSION THAT YOU LAWSUIT IS. AND I KNOW WHAT YOU NOW. I I UNDERSTAND SO HELP ME HELP ME OUT [inaudible] BUT YOU MENTIONED THAT YOU HAD -- TEN INDIVIDUALS PROFESSIONALS THAT OF OVERSEE. ELEVEN HUNDRED SCHOOLS WAS A HUNDRED AND TEN A SCHOOLS PER INDIVIDUAL -- WE KNOW WE WILL LOOK THROUGH A LOT OF STATE AGENCIES THAT -- HAVE. EARLY HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE ON THEIR STAFF. IS THERE A NUMBER THAT WOULD GIVE YOU A BETTER BALANCE -- OF SUPPORT. TO BE ABLE TO TEN IT AS YOU MENTIONED YOU HAD SO MANY COMPLAINTS. IS THERE A NUMBER OF OF FULL TIME EMPLOYEES WOULD BE A BETTER BALANCE TO BE ABLE TO DO YOUR JOB MORE EFFECTIVELY. WELL IT IT REALLY WOULD DEPEND I I APPRECIATE THAT BECAUSE IT REALLY JUST DEPENDS ON HOW MUCH MORE SUPPORT WE GET WITH THE LAW BECAUSE RIGHT NOW REMEMBER. THE TWO MILLION DOLLARS THAT THE THE FEDS PAY TO THE STATE COVERS EVERYTHING THAT THOSE FOLKS DO. ALL TWELVE OF THOSE PEOPLE THERE AND THAT THAT WOULD MEAN I HAVE NOTHING. LEFT TO DO WHAT WE WOULD WANT WHICH WOULD BE TO FOR OVERSIGHT AND MONITORING OF THOSE INSTITUTIONS SO EVEN AT BEST WE WOULD NEED WHAT WAS CALM WHAT WE HAVE NOW -- BECAUSE I HAVE NOTHING. THE THE VA EVEN WHEN WE HAVE THESE LEVELS I STILL HAVE THE CHALLENGE OF DOING THE EXACT SAME THING WITH THE STATE LAW BEING IN EFFECT -- I'M GOING TO BE BALLOTS IN TRYING TO BALANCE BETWEEN OKAY HOW MUCH OF MY STAFF TIME CAN BE ALLOCATED TOWARDS. DOING WHAT THE STATE'S PRIORITIES ARE -- AND THEN Vì A CHALLENGE THAT'S WHERE WE'VE BEEN THAT'S WHERE WE'VE BEEN OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS AND I THINK THEY NEED TO COME TO THE FOREFRONT BECAUSE WHAT I'M SAYING IS. YOUR WORKLOAD IS GOING TO INCREASE YES WITH THE ADDITIONAL RESPONSIBILITY THAT IS CORRECT SO IT HAS TO BE IN THE LEGISLATION THAT THE TO THE WITH THE ADDITIONAL WORKLOAD THAT HAS TO BE A FUNDING MECHANISM TO BE ABLE. TO ADJUST TO THAT THAT WORK LOOK. THAT BEINGS AND OTHERS THINGS BEING SAID IS YOU KNOW. WHEN WE WORK ON THIS EARLIER ON WE DID HAVE TO TAKE SOME AMENDMENTS DUE TO SOME SOME? HIGH LEVEL PRESSURE TWENTY WHICH DID WATER DOWN THE BILL TO A CERTAIN EXTENT. I THINK THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT THAT NOW AND GO BACK TO THE ORIGINAL FORMAT -- JUST WITH THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF BOTH OF YOU ON WHAT IS NECESSARY TO BE ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH THE GOAL. OF OF OF GOING FORWARD -- WHEN YOU WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT? YOU KNOW WHAT IS NEEDED OR WHAT IS NECESSARY TO SUPPORT -- YOU FOR YOU SAID YOU HAD. SEVEN BILLS OUT THAT WERE OUT THIS YEARS OR SO SO. THEY WERE IN IN. WE DO NOT KNOW THE IN THE LATE. AS A WHOLE. YOU KNOW THERE'S A THERE'S A CERTAIN -- ABILITY TO AMEND BILLS. I'D LOVE TO BE ABLE TO TALK TO BOTH YOU AFTERWARDS TO BE ABLE. TO YOU KNOW WITH THE CHAIRS TO BE ABLE. TO MAYBE MAKE ADJUSTMENTS TO POLICY COMMITTEES THAT WOULD MAKE THIS. A LAST TIME. LET'S FIX THIS. GO FOR PROTECT THE VETERANS PROTECT. ALL OF THE STUDENT'S GOING FORWARD YOU KNOW THIS PROCESS AND YOU KNOW THIS IS HOW WE GET THIGS DONE WHEN YOU COME IN BE. WHEN YOU'RE ABLE TO BE FRANK AND ON ON FOURTH COMING TO US HOW WE CAN BETTER SUPPORT YOU? THIS IS HOW IT'S SUPPOSED TO WORK I'M REALLY JAZZ SO WE CAN DO THIS TOGETHER. THANK YOU THANK YOU. HAD A ON THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER VOEPEL. SO A A FOLLOW ON TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRASIER'S. HOW LONG IS THE AVERAGE TIME? TO FINISH A COMPLAINT TO RESEARCH AND ANALYZE IT IN AND COME OUT WITH THE OUTCOME. SURE THAT'S A THAT'S A VERY HARD QUESTION BECAUSE DEPENDING ON THE LEVEL OF THE COMPLAINT AND DID THE COMPLAINT COME DIRECTLY TO US OR DID HE COME FROM ANOTHER BUREAU BOARD. SO THAT'S A REALLY HARD QUESTION TO PASS TO BE QUITE HONEST ANSWERED BUT I WILL WORK ON TRYING TO GET YOU AN ANSWER. I'LL TAKE ANYTHING AGO I WORK ON SO. WHAT'S THE AVERAGE TIME TO FINISH A COMPLAINT [inaudible] IT'S A MAKE SOME UPDATES OKAY A S. S. I WOULD HATE TO DO THAT JUST BECAUSE WE TAKE THAT STILL SERIOUS AND I WOULD RATHER GIVE YOU A MORE SUCCINCT ANSWER TO BE QUITE HONEST. HONEST OKAY WE CAN DO THAT AFTER THE HEARING HERE ABSOLUTELY YOU CAN GIVE ME AN ESTIMATE ON I MEAN IF YOU HAVE. AROUND TWELVE HUNDRED COMPLAINTS ANOTHER HAVE HAD [inaudible] OKAY HEN -- I'M JUST CURIOUS BECAUSE I WOULD LOVE TO SEE. STAFF IN THEM PROVED. IN ORDER TO HAVE MORE -- I IS ON THE PROBLEM IN ORDER TO EXPEDITE. THE COMPLAINTS ABSOLUTELY I MEAN THAT JUST MAKES LOGICAL SENSE BUT YOU HAVE TO HAVE A BEGINNING TO KNOW. HOW LONG IS THE AVERAGE COMPLAIN AND THEN WE CAN SEE WHAT THE IMPROVEMENT IS OR? I FOUND IN THE CORPORATE WORLD THAT WHEN YOU PUT MORE EYES ON A PROBLEM SOMETIMES IT EXTENDS THE PROBLEM BECAUSE NOW. YOU'RE ANALYZING MORE DATA MORE INFORMATION YOU FOUND MORE PROBLEMS THAN WHAT YOU THOUGHT YOU HAD. SO YOU NEVER KNOW YES ABSOLUTELY OKAY -- LAST QUESTION UNACCREDITED SCHOOLS. AND I'M NOT HUNTING HERE OKAY THIS IS A OF OF BASIC QUESTION NUMBER. EIGHTY SIX NOT LOOK AT IT UNACCREDITED SCHOOLS NOT NECESSARILY BAD OR GOOD -- I'M% THINKING IN MY HEAD MY LITTLE NOODLE. THAT UNACCREDITED SCHOOLS COULD VERY WELL BE NEW SCHOOLS NEW EDUCATION CONCEPTS THAT JUST HAVEN'T BEEN ACCEPTED YET OR ACCREDITED WAR THEY JUST HAPPENED -- MARKED OFF ALL THE BOXES IS THAT A GOOD WAY FOR ME TO THINK OF THAT WILL IT AN ACCREDITED SCHOOL I MEAN IT'S BY CHOICE. TRANSPORTATION IS BY CHOICE WHETHER SCHOOL DECIDES TO DO THAT -- SO WHAT HAPPENS IS IS THAT WHEN AN INSTITUTION APPLIES TO US -- IF THEY HAVE NOT BEEN THROUGH THE PROCESS OF ACCREDITATION. RECOGNIZED AS ON A CREDIT IT. THEY MAY NOT HAVE CHOSEN THAT BECAUSE FINANCIALLY IT MAY NOT MAKE SENSE TO THEM -- TYPICALLY YOU WOULD FIND IT THE UNACCREDITED INSTITUTIONS ARE THOSE WHO SMALLER INSTITUTIONS THAT SURVEY GENERAL POPULATE BERRY SMALL POPULATION OR HAVE A SPECIFIC -- CURRICULUM THAT MEETS A PARTICULAR NICHE. THANK YOU FOR THE CLEAR FINE QUESTION MADAM CHAIR OF DOE. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER VOEPEL -- WHAT ARE THE ISSUES THAT -- THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS ACCUSE SEE SAVE A BEING OVERZEALOUS ON APPLYING ANY OF THE STANDARDS BASICALLY FOR EXAMPLE -- THE BUREAU FOR PRIVATE POSTSECONDARY REQUIRES THAT AN INSTITUTION HAVE A PERFORMANCE FACT SHEET AND THAT PERFORMANCE FACTUALLY ESSENTIALLY SAYS TO A STUDENT -- THIS PROGRAM IS OFFERED HAS BEEN OFFERED IN THIS IS THE SUCCESS. OF THAT PROGRAM. WELL WHAT WE DO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE DO IT WITH MY AGENCY IS I REQUIRE THAT MY STAFF. GET THE DETAILS. THEY NEED TO IF YOU SAY BROWN NUMBER FOR THE SAKE OF THIS CONVERSATION THAT FIFTY PEOPLE WENT THROUGH THE PROGRAM AND TWENTY FIVE OF THEM THIRTY WHATEVER. THAT. JOB WERE EMPLOYED IN THE FIELD. THEN WE VALIDATE THAT WE VALIDATE THE INFORMATION WOULD. EITHER YOU'RE PRESENTING US WITH ACTUAL DATA ARE YOU NOT. THAT MEANS YOU SEND US FIFTY NAMES. WE LOOK THROUGH THOSE WE RANDOMLY. CHECK TO MAKE SURE THAT SOMEONE ANYBODY EVERYBODY GOT A JOB. IF THEY WE IF THEY COME BACK AND THEY HAVEN'T RECEIVED EMPLOYMENT THOSE THAT DATA ISN'T. ACCURATE THEN WE DON'T APPROVE THE PROGRAM. THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT THE VA SAYS THAT WE SHOULDN'T DO. THEY DON'T WANT US GOING INTO THAT LEVEL OF DETAIL -- THERE ARE EVEN INSTITUTIONS WHERE WE SAY -- THEY SUBMIT THEIR APPLICATION THEY WANT TO APPLY FOR CREDIT PROGRAMS WILL. WE REQUIRE THAT YOU ARE MEETING YOUR REQUIREMENTS FOR ACCREDITATION THE BENCHMARKS THAT THE IT CREDITORS THAT. IF YOU DON'T WE WON'T APPROVE YOU. Vì ã SAYS THAT'S TOO FAR. THEIR CREDIT IT THEY SHOULD BE APPROVED BY US. SO IT HAS TO LITERALLY. TAKEN OUT ALL OF THE PROTECTIONS THAT WE THOUGHT WE WERE PUTTING IN PLACE TO ENSURE THAT YOU CAN. THEY CAN OFFER THE PROGRAM IT JUST WON'T BE FOR VETERANS UNTIL THEY CAN DEMONSTRATE THAT THEY MEET THE STANDARD THEY NEED TO COME UP AND BE ABLE TO INSURE BECAUSE WHAT'S AT RISK IS NOT JUST BENEFIT. LIKE -- MISS RUTH WAS SENT ITS ENTITLEMENT THEY ONLY HAVE A CERTAIN WINDOW. SO IF FOR EIGHTEEN MONTHS THEIR CREDITORS SAYS ALL YOU CAN KEEP TEACHING THE PROGRAM YOU CAN BRING IT UP TO WHATEVER THE STANDARD IS THAT EIGHTEEN MONTHS OF A BIT OF A VETERANS ENTITLEMENT. THAT HE OR SHE WILL NOT GET BACK FROM THE VA. SO WE'RE WE'RE TRYING TO DO IT ON THE BEGINNING AT THE BEGINNING TO NOT GIVE YOU APPROVAL BECAUSE IT'S MORE DIFFICULT TO TAKE IT ONCE IT'S BEEN ISSUED. OKAY AND THEN ALSO IS SO IS IT CORRECT TO SAY THAT IF THE BUREAU HAS AN ACTIVE APPROVAL OF THE PROGRAM TO A SCHOOL THAT SEE SAID CAN'T SUSPEND THAT PROGRAM IF IT FINDS VIOLATIONS THAT IS CORRECT. IF THE A CREDITOR FIND A VIOLATION AND THEY REMAIN ACCREDITED. WE MUST KEEP THAT PROGRAM FOR THAT AREN'T. ALL WHILE THE VETERAN KNOWS NOTHING. OKAY WELL THIS HAS BEEN -- VERY INFORMATIVE -- REALLY WANT TO THANK YOU FOR SPENDING SOMETIME WITH US THIS AFTERNOON THANK YOU SO MUCH. I WOULD LIKE NOW TO INVITE UP OUR FINAL. AND I AM PLEASED TO INVITE UP. A MAJOR SANITARY OF THE CALIFORNIA MILITARY DEPARTMENT. DEAN NANCY MATERNAL MONTGOMERY. OF IRVINE VALLEY COLLEGE AND SETH READ OF READ GOVERNMENT RELATIONS YOU MAYBE GET. HEAR ME NOW. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TODAY AND TALK ABOUT MY PROGRAM AND THE UNIQUE TOUCH POINTS THAT WE HAVE WITH THE TRANSITIONING SERVICE MEMBERS AND ALSO OUR VETERANS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I'M JAN AND TERRY I AM THE DIRECTOR OF THE WORK FOR WARRIORS JOB PLACEMENT PROGRAM. OUR PLACEMENT PROGRAM IS IN ITS SEVENTH YEAR OF EXISTENCE. AND OUR CONSTITUENCY THAT WE SERVE IS ALL OF CALIFORNIA'S MILITARY AND VETERANS COMMUNITIES. THIS INCLUDES HEN IS NOT LIMITED TO THE RESERVES THE VETERANS ALL FAMILY MEMBERS SPOUSES CHILDREN. AND I GOES FAR TO SAY AUNTS AND UNCLES. D. AT RISK USE THAT ARE PART OF OUR YOUTH CHALLENGE COMMUNITIES AND ALSO RECENTLY -- DECLARED EMERGENCY SURVIVORS FOR EXAMPLE THE YOU CAN'T FIRE -- WITH REGARD TO OUR UNIQUE POPULATION THAT WE SERVE. I THINK THAT I'M IN A GOOD POSITION TO SPEAK. ABOUT THE CURRENT NEEDS OF THE SERVICE MEMBERS THAT WE TOUCH. ON AVERAGE MOST OF MY CLIENTS AND REPORTS OF A SIXTY EIGHT HUNDRED PLACEMENTS RIGHT NOW. SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE AND MOST OF MY CLIENTS HAVE USED THE GI BILL OR USING THE GI BILL IN SOME CAPACITY OR ANOTHER. ONE OF THE BIGGEST ADVANTAGES THAT WE SEE ABOUT HAVING THE GI BILL BENEFITS. IS. YOUR ABILITY TO HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF A CUSHIONING PERIOD ALMOST. SO THERE'S NOT A LOT OF THERE'S NOT AS MUCH PRESSURE I WOULD SAY ON AVERAGE FOR SOMEONE TO COME OUT OF THE ACTIVE DUTY SAVE BY A WAY OF TAPS ARE CAL TAPS. TO GO IMMEDIATELY INTO THE FIRST JOB THEY FIND BECAUSE THEY NEED THE FINANCES SO SO QUICKLY. WHAT WE'RE SEEING NOW IS A TENDENCY TO HOLD OFF TO PURSUE THE EDUCATION OR IN SOME CASES PURSUE THE VOCATIONAL TECHNICAL SCHOOL THE APPRENTICESHIP -- WHATEVER IT IS THAT THEY CHOOSE. BUT THE THE BEST VALUE THAT I SEE OF THE GI BILL IS THE ABILITY TO BE FLEXIBLE WITH THOSE DECISIONS. AND THEN TO TAKE YOUR TIME AND REALLY. DECIDE WHAT YOU WANT TO DO AND ALSO BECAUSE IT IS SUCH A RECORD UNEMPLOYMENT ACROSS THE STATE. TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ALMOST LIKE A BUYER'S MARKET FOR JOBS. WE HAVE ALL THESE TRANSITIONING SERVICE MEMBERS OF THING CALIFORNIA VETERANS COMMUNITIES ARE FAMILIES AND EVERYONE. AND WE'RE A REALLY NEAT PLACE WHERE I'M NOT PUTTING THEM INTO JOBS AND PUTTING THEM INTO CAREERS. PUTTING HIM INTO NEXT LEVEL EMPLOYMENT AND WITHOUT HAVING THE GI BILL BENEFITS. I'M NOT SURE THAT THEY WOULD BE AS COMPETITIVE. GOOD AFTERNOON I NANCY MONTGOMERY I AM A THE ASSISTANT DEAN AT UC IRVINE VALLEY COLLEGE I COME TO YOU TODAY WITH SOME DATA AND SOME INFORMATION ABOUT OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE POPULATION OF VETERANS CURRENTLY WE HAVE A HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN COMMUNITY COLLEGES WITHIN THE STATE. WE HAVE ABOUT EIGHTY TO NINETY THOUSAND OF VETERANS THAT ARE ENROLLED IN THE COLLEGE'S -- THERE'S NEVER BEEN ANY DATA WE'VE NEVER GOTTEN ANY DATA ON THE STUDENTS BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE SET UP UNIFORM GUIDELINES IN DATA KIND OF RESEARCH PROJECTS OUT THERE RECENTLY THIS LAST YEAR -- I WAS THE RECIPIENT OF AN INNOVATION GRANT THROUGH THE STATE WE DID A STATEWIDE STUDY OUT OF A HUNDRED FOURTEEN COLLEGES IT'S THE STATE OF THE VETERAN STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES IS THE FIRST DATA EVER. ON POST NINE ELEVEN VETERANS THAT ARE ENROLLED IN THE STATE -- pINFORMATION AND MOSTLY INFORMATION THAT WE KIND OF ALREADY KNEW BUT NOW IT'S QUANTIFIABLE AND IN EVIDENCE HERE. WE SENT OUT -- WE RECEIVED ABOUT FIFTEEN HUNDRED SURVEYS FROM VETERANS WE SURVEYED A HUNDRED AND SIX COMMUNITY COLLEGES WE DID OBSERVATIONS WE DID FOCUS GROUPS ALL OF IT IS DOCUMENTED IN HERE BUT LET ME READ I WROTE A LOT OF IT IN HERE WITH MY TEAM. BUT I DID WANT TO READ TO YOU WHAT WE WERE LOOKING AT AND SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT CAME OUT OF HERE AND THEN I'LL HIGHLIGHT THAT DATA. MANY U. S. VETERAN SEPARATE FROM THE MILITARY AND ENCOUNTER DIFFICULTIES IN TRANSITIONING TO CIVILIAN LIFE MILITARY SEPARATION REPRESENTS SIGNIFICANT SHIFTS AND PERSONAL AND SOCIAL IDENTITY PURPOSE CULTURE RELATIONSHIPS AND LIVING SITUATIONS AND THE LIVES OF VETERANS. MANY SERVICE MEMBERS SEPARATE FROM THE MILITARY ILL EQUIPPED TO BEGIN THEIR CIVILIAN LIVES BY NOT SECURING HOUSING AND OR EMPLOYMENT SERVICE MEMBERS MAY BE CONTENDING WITH PHYSICAL AND OR MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES AND THESE ISSUES MAY BE COMPOUNDED BY VETERANS NEED TO ADJUST TO THEIR SELF IDENTITY. AND TRANSITION TO CIVILIAN CULTURE ALONG WITH THAT COLLEGE ADMINISTRATORS FACULTY STAFF. AND NON VETERANS STUDENTS MAY NOT BE AWARE OF THE IMPACT THAT SERVED IN THE MILITARY CAN HAVE. I BET THOSE SERVED IN THE MILITARY CAN HAVE ON THE ABILITY OF VETERANS STUDENTS TO COPE WITH AND OVERCOME MANY OF THE CHALLENGES THAT I JUST MENTIONED. SOME OF THE I IMPORTANT DATA THAT I JUST WANTED TO BRIEFLY -- GO OVER WITH YOU A SNAPSHOT OF WHAT OUR VETERANS LOOK LIKE AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES IS THE AGE RANGE IS ABOUT TWENTY ONE TO FORTY GENERALLY STE TWENTY FOUR TO TWENTY TO THIRTY FIVE NEEDLESS TO SAY BECAUSE THEY'VE SERVED BY ANYWHERE FROM ONE TO EIGHT YEARS IN THE MILITARY WHEN. THEY COME OUT. MOSTLY A MALE POPULATION WE HAVE A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF FEMALES IN THERE BUT GENERALLY IT'S MALES MOSTLY MARINES AND ARMY BECAUSE THOSE ARE THAT THE LARGEST GROUPS THEY'RE OUT THERE YOU WON'T SAY THEY SEE THAT SAN DIEGO THOUGH YOU'LL SEE A LOT OF NAVY OUT THERE -- ACCORDING TO OUR DAILY WE LOOK ON HERE THAT OR DEPLOYED TO FLOAT -- AND 70% SUFFERED ILLNESS OR INJURY FROM SERVICE WHEN YOU LOOK AT THOSE NUMBERS AND YOU THINK ABOUT THE ILLNESS OR INJURY MY BACKGROUND IS IN NURSING IT ALWAYS HAS BEEN I FELL IN LOVE WITH VETERANS YEARS AGO AT MY LAST COLLEGES REDUCE COLLEGE WHEN A MARINE WALKED IN AND ASKED. ME IF I WOULD HELP THEM SET UP A VETERAN RESOURCE CENTER AND I TOLD THEM I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT VETERANS. HI I SET MYSELF OFF AND I DID RESEARCH THAT WAS PROBABLY TO FEET TALL AND I FIGURED IT OUT WHAT THEY REALLY NEEDED WAS SUPPORT SERVICES THEY NEEDED SOMETHING TO HELP THEM ACCLIMATE BACK AND WE NEEDED TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES BEFORE THEY CAN ACTUALLY BE IN COLLEGE AND REALLY. DO WELL BECAUSE THEY'RE WASTING THEIR BENEFITS THAT'S THE WHOLE BOTTOM LINE RIGHT THERE. SO SOME OF THE HEALTH CONCERNS THAT I LOOKED AT AND THEN I FOUND THE VA LOOKS AT A LOT OF THEM THE THREE MOST FREQUENT VISITED HEALTH CONCERNS ARE MUSCULAR SKELETAL. MIDDLE DISORDERS AND SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN THEY DON'T KNOW WHERE IT'S COMING FROM THEIR HEARING LOSS IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS AND I WILL TELL YOU RIGHT NOW THAT IF YOU'RE A COLLEGE SETTING I DON'T CARE WHERE YOU ARE IF YOU HAVE HEARING LOSS. YOU REALLY HAVE A DEFICIT WHEN YOU GO IN THERE -- THE PROBLEM THAT I SEE WITH THE VA HEALTH CARE SYSTEM IS THERE IS A ONE YEAR WAIT TO EVEN GET AN APPOINTMENT WITH AN AUDIOLOGIST. TO ASSESS THE HEARING NEED IT COST TWENTY FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS TO GET THE HEARING DEVICES IN YEARS TO BE ABLE TO HEAR THEIR AND I HAVE HAD SEVERAL VETERANS GOING TO GET THOSE TYPE OF DEVICES. AND BE ABLE TO DO SO MUCH BETTER IN THEIR CLASSROOM BUT GETTING IN THERE IN ACCESSING THAT IS REALLY DIFFICULT. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES THAT THEY COME IN WITH THE VA ALSO MENTIONS THAT THE TOP THREE ARE PTSD SYMPTOMS POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER? DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS AND ALSO IN RODDICK. THE COLLEGE DATA COMES OUT AND SAYS THAT THEY HAVE THE THE MOST IMPORTANT IT -- MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES ARE AND ZAIDI DEPRESSION PTSD SYMPTOMS AND LONELINESS. THEY ALSO SAY THAT THEY HAVE DIFFICULTY SLEEPING DIFFICULTY CONCENTRATING AND FEELING DISTANCE FROM OTHERS BECAUSE THEY DON'T ALWAYS KIND OF FEEL LIKE THEY'RE PART OF THE GROUP WHEN YOU COME IN WITH THE A GROUP OF YOUNGER STUDENTS IN THE COLLEGE SETTING THERE. THEY HAVE DISTURBING MEMORIES THEY HAVE THOUGHTS AND THEY HAVE THINGS THAT THEY THINK ABOUT IN THEIR MILITARY COMBAT EXPERIENCE ESPECIALLY THE MORE OFTEN THAT THEY WERE DEPLOYED. THEY SEEM TO HAVE A LOT MORE ISSUES THAT THEY HAVE TO LOOK AT WITH MENTAL HEALTH AND ALSO MEDICAL ISSUES THERE. MILITARY SEXUAL ASSAULT ACCORDING TO USA TODAY -- THE OTHER DAY WOULD JUST TO STATED THAT WE ARE UP SINCE 20001638% FROM TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN A MILITARY SEXUAL ASSAULTS THOSE ISSUES COME BACK TO US IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE WE'RE LOOKING AT THOSE ISSUES ON HOW DO WE CARE FOR THOSE. THOSE MILITARY COMING BACK WHAT DO WE DO. IT'S WELL KNOWN IN OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES THAT FEMALES DON'T REALLY COME INTO A LOT OF OUR VETERAN RESOURCE CENTERS THEY DON'T FEEL LIKE THEY'RE A PART OF IT SOMETIMES THEY FEEL DISTANCE THEY DON'T LIKE THE LANGUAGE THEY DON'T LIKE THAT KIND OF A BARRACKS TYPE SITUATION -- IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO EVEN REACH THOSE FEMALES IS DIFFICULT TO REACH A LOT OF MILITARY THAT ARE ON CAMPUS IS THERE. WHAT CAN WE DO TO IMPROVE THESE TYPE OF THINGS WHAT CAN WE LOOK AT WHEN WE'RE WE'RE? LOOKING AT VETERANS IN COLLEGE SYSTEMS THE IDEA IS TO KEEP THEM THEIR PERSISTENCE AND THEIR COMPLETION RATES CONSISTENT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THEY GRADUATE TAKING ON I KNOW -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER VOCAL MENTIONED ABOUT THE CONTINUING ON WITH TWELVE UNITS THEY HAVE TO TAKE TWELVE UNITS MINIMUM JUST TO GET THEIR VA BENEFITS MOST OF THEM TAKE FIFTEEN IN EIGHTEEN UNITS IN A LOT OF TIMES ARE WORKING PART TIME JOBS. THEY'RE TRYING TO DO THINGS ORANGE COUNTY GIVES A A BASE PAY OF LIKE TWENTY SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH FOR BOARD HOUSING SAN FRANCISCO IS UP TO ABOUT FORTY THREE TO FORTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH BECAUSE OF THE COST OF LIVING. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THAT BY THE TIME YOU PAY RENT YOU PAY YOUR BASIC COST OF LIVING THAT'S ONLY REALLY FOR NINE MONTHS BECAUSE WE HAVE TO STOP PAY PERIODS DURING THE SUMMER THEY DON'T GET PAID OR THEY GET HALF PAY? AND THEN DURING THE WINTER WHEN THEY HAVE ANY TYPE OF BREAK THEY DON'T GET FULL PAY THAT MUCH. SO YOU HAVE TO ACCOUNT FOR THAT IN THERE TOO WHICH CAUSES STRESS TO THEM. THEY COME OUT WITH FOOD AND SECURITY IS VERY LITTLE SUPPORT A LOT OF TIMES MOST OF THEM WENT INTO THE MILITARY BECAUSE THEY WERE LOOKING FOR EIGHT A FAMILY A UNIT THEY FOUND THAT IN THERE. NOW THEY COME BACK OUT ESPECIALLY FEMALES AND THEY HAVE NO ONE TO COME OUT TO AND IT REALLY MAKES A STRESSFUL YOU'LL FIND THAT ON CALIFORNIA IS THE LARGEST STATE WITH THE MOST VETERANS BECAUSE EVEN WHEN THEY'RE COMING FROM THE MIDWEST OR ON THE EAST COAST. ON A STAIN CALIFORNIA THEY LIKE CALIFORNIA WHAT FOR WHATEVER REASON I'M SURE IS THE WEATHER IN THAT GIRLS AND WHATEVER ELSE BUT BUT THEY DO STAY AND THEY ENJOY THAT SO SO THAT'S A GOOD PART OF IT -- BUT THEY ARE IN OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND WE ARE THEIR FIRST AVENUE OF EDUCATION BECAUSE WE'RE EASY ACCESS SO MAKES IT REALLY NICE THERE. WHAT WE'VE DONE OVER THE LAST COUPLE YEARS AS WE HAD FUNDING FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ON GOING FUNDING THANK YOU ASSEMBLY WOMAN IRWIN FOR TAKING THAT CHARGE ON THERE? WE WERE ABLE TO GET THAT FUNDING GOING ON THERE TO SUPPORT SOME OF OUR VETERAN RESOURCE CENTERS WE NEED MORE SUPPORT MANY DEDICATED STAFF WE NEED ACTED COUNSELORS TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN THEY COME IN A PUT THEIR ACADEMIC PLANS TO GATHER THOSE TWELVE UNITS REALLY COUNT. TO WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE TAKING FOR THAT MAJOR THE BE A REQUIRES THAT YOU TAKE SPECIFIC MAJORS AND IN THAT WAS MAJORS YOU CAN ONLY TAKE SPECIFIC CLASSES SO YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO TAKE BASKET WEAVING IN CERAMICS AND GET THAT APPROVED. THEY ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE MILITARY CREDITS ARE GIVEN WE HAVE SUCH A DIVERSE -- RIGHT NOW. ACCUMULATION OF MILITARY CREDIT SOME COLLEGES WILL GIVE FOUR UNITS OTHERS WILL GIVE FORTY UNITS I STRONGLY FEEL GIVING FORTY UNITS TO A A VETERAN THERE'S JUST COMING OUT OF THE MILITARY THAT'S TRYING TO GET THEIR LIFE TOGETHER IN ACCLIMATING AND ALL OF THE ISSUES THAT I JUST STATED HERE. NOT A WISE IDEA BECAUSE WE'RE KIND OF SETTING THEM UP FOR FAILURE WE NEED TO HELP THEM ACCLIMATING GET THEMSELVES GOING THERE. TO SO AGAIN FUNDING THOSE VETERAN RESOURCE CENTERS WHICH ARE THE MAIN SOURCE OF THEIR SUPPORT -- IN IN THAT MANDATING POLICY PROCEDURES AND GUIDELINES SO THAT WE HAVE THOSE SUPPORTS ON THE VA HAS BEEN A VERY VERY -- DEVASTATING TYPE OF PROGRAM TO WORK WITH FOR ANYBODY COMING OUT ONLY 60% OF OUR VETERANS ARE ACTUALLY ENROLLED IN BE A HEALTH CARE. THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THEY NEED TO BE ENROLLED IN AUTOMATICALLY BEFORE THEIR DISCHARGED OFF A BASE. I TO CONTINUE THEIR PHYSICAL THERAPY TO CONTINUE ANYTHING FOR BACK SHOULDERS KNEES INJURIES ANYTHING LIKE THAT THAT GOES ON ESPECIALLY HEARING. THEY DON'T HAVE ANY OF THAT ACCESS THERE SO THEY COME ONTO OUR CAN'T COLLEGE CAMPUSES NEEDLESS TO SAY IT'S A POPULATION THAT DOESN'T. ASK FOR MUCH THE KIND OF LIVE IN SILENCE THE PROBLEM IS THOUGH THAT LIVING IN THAT SILENCE IS THEY SUFFER WITH THEIR OWN INSIDE BONES AND THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO COMPLETE CLASSES THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO USE THEIR BENEFITS LIKE THEY SHOULD AND THEY HUESO THIRTY SIX MONTHS. AND WE NEED TO GET HIM THERE -- I STRONGLY FEEL THAT AS I SAID SUPPLYING THE SUPPORT SYSTEMS AND GIVING THAT TO THE COLLEGES WOULD MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE IN THIS BOOKLET YOU'LL FIND THAT WE HAD -- FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS AND SOME OF THE KEY FINDINGS WAR NUMBER ONE WAS ON HAT ON MET MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS WE NEED TO HAVE A A COMPLETE PARTNERSHIP WITH THE VA BRINGING MENTAL HELP FOR PROVIDERS TO EVERY COLLEGE CAMPUS THAT SHOULD BE MANDATED THERE'S NO. TWO WAYS ABOUT IT COLLEGE STUDENTS IN GENERAL ONE IN THREE HAVE A MENTAL HEALTH DISORDER. THE POINT IS EVERYBODY NEEDS IT BUT WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT COMBAT WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT MENTAL STRESS WERE LOOKING AT THE ATROCITIES THAT OUR MILITARY HAVE VIEWED AND VISUALIZED AND BEEN A PART OF THEY NEED A LOT MORE MENTAL HEALTH. NUMBER TWO IS ALSO A LACK OF UNDERSTANDING OF VETERANS STUDENTS UNIQUE CHALLENGES AMONG THE V. R. C. STAFF AND FACULTY FACULTY ARE SOMETIMES NOT ALWAYS AND WE LOVE OUR FACTLY BUT SOMETIMES THEY'RE NOT ALWAYS UNDERSTANDING WHEN VETERANS NEED APPOINTMENTS ARE THEY HAVE APPOINTMENTS MADE THERE. YOU CAN CANCEL OF THE A APPOINTMENT BECAUSE YOU WON'T GET IT AGAIN FOR ANOTHER SIX TO NINE MONTHS. NEED FOR STUDENT FRIENDLY BUSINESS HOURS AND SPACES NEED FOR INCREASED CAPACITY TO SUPPORT VETERANS STUDENTS EDUCATIONAL PLANNING AND BENEFITS THAT MEANS MORE ACADEMIC COUNSELORS THAT ARE TRAINED IN THEIR VA BENEFITS. NEED FOR STRONGER PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN THE V. A AND THE R. C.'S EVEN AND ROLLING THEM IN THE BE A HEALTHCARE. LACK OF CONSISTENT AND RELIABLE DATA ABOUT VETERANS STUDENTS AGAIN THIS IS THE FIRST DAY THAT WE'VE EVER PRODUCED ON VETERAN STUDENTS SO THOSE ARE THE ISSUES WERE LOOKING AT AND THAT'S WHAT WE STRONGLY SUGGEST AS A TEAM OF US TO PUT TOGETHER AND AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN GET OUR VETERANS. TO A TO GRADUATE SOONER THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NO ONE TO THE LAST. AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS MY NAME IS SET. THREE WITH THREE GOVERNMENT RELATIONS I REPRESENT THE AMERICAN GI FORUM AMERICAN LEGION. AMVETS CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF COUNTY VETERANS SERVICE OFFICERS CALIFORNIA STATE COMMANDERS VETERANS COUNCIL. MILITARY OFFICERS ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA NATIONAL GUARD ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA AND THE VIETNAM VETERANS OF AMERICA. I SPENT FIVE YEARS IN THE UNITED STATES ARMY AS AN INFANTRYMAN I DEPLOYED BOTH IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN AND AFGHANISTAN AND SPENT TWENTY TWO MONTHS DEPLOYED. AFTER MY DISCHARGE FROM THE ARMY I REALIZED THAT AS AN INFANTRYMAN. I DID NOT HAVE MUCH IN THE WAY OF TRANSFERABLE SKILLS FROM THE MILITARY. THAT WOULD HELP ME INTEGRATE INTO THE WORK FORCE. I FACED SOME OF THE SAME CHALLENGES AS MANY OTHER SERVICE MEMBERS ON SEPARATING FROM THE MILITARY. WHERE TO WORK WHERE TO LIVE? RENTING OR PURCHASING A HOME GETTING KIDS TO DAYCARE AND OR SCHOOL. I WAS MOST CONCERNED. WITH PROVIDING FOR MY FAMILY I WAS ABLE TO GET A JOB AS A SHEET METAL APPRENTICE MAKING MINIMUM WAGE. BECAUSE THE HIGH COST OF LIVING IN CALIFORNIA. I OFTEN HAD TO RELY ON FAMILY AND FRIENDS TO KEEP A ROOF OVER MY HEAD. MOVING FROM APARTMENT TO APARTMENT WAS A STRUGGLE FOR THE FIRST FEW YEARS AFTER MY SERVICE. I BECAME USED TO LIVING OUT OF A DUFFEL BAG. AFTER MY TWO TOURS. BUT I COULDN'T BEAR MY FAMILY LIVING THAT WAY AS WELL. EVENTUALLY I LOOKED INTO ATTENDING A FOR PROFIT TRADE SCHOOL TO ADVANCE MY CAREER. I HAD MY OWN USED TO GI BILL BENEFITS AND I KNEW I HAD TO USE THEM WITHIN FIFTEEN YEARS OF MILITARY DISCHARGE. DURING MY SEARCH FOR TRADE SCHOOL I FOUND THAT I COULD NOT EVEN GET INFORMATION. FROM THE SCHOOL WITHOUT GIVING THEM MY CONTACT INFORMATION. THIS RESULTED. IN [inaudible] RELENTLESS. CALLS. OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS. EVEN FROM SCHOOLS THAT I ATTENDED COMPLETED AND GRADUATED FROM. I SPENT NINE MONTHS IN ABOUT TWENTY TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS TO MY GI BILL BENEFIT. A FOR PROFIT COLLEGE OBTAIN ALL EPA REQUIRED CERTIFICATES TO BECOME A SERVICE TECHNICIAN. BUT IN POINT OPPORTUNITIES WITHIN THAT FIELD. WERE ALMOST NONEXISTENT. I'VE SINCE SEEN OTHER SIMILAR PROGRAMS AND I SEE NOW. THAT'S THE ONE I WENT THROUGH WAS SUB STANDARD. I HAVE A CLOSE FRIEND THAT. THAT I SERVED WITH ALL FIVE YEARS OF MY SERVICE. HE'S CURRENTLY GOING THROUGH A SIMILAR PROGRAM HERE IN THIS AREA. SIMPLY BECAUSE HE NEEDS THE ADDITIONAL INCOME FROM THE GI BILL AS HE WORKS FULL TIME. BUT HE IS NOT SATISFIED WITH THE EDUCATION THAT HE IS RECEIVING. LATER I ATTENDED YET ANOTHER LATER ATTENDED YET ANOTHER FOR PROFIT CERTIFICATION SCHOOL IN SEARCH OF A TRADE THAT WOULD LEAD TO A RELIABLE EMPLOYMENT. AGAIN OPPORTUNITIES WERE FEW. MAKING SURE THAT THE SCHOOLS ARE HERE TO STANDARDS IS VITAL. IS A VITAL PART OF PROTECTING THE GI BILL FOR VETERANS LIKE ME. WHY THE GI BILL SUCH IMPORTANT BENEFIT? FIRST IT ALLOWS VETERANS LIKE ME. TO THAT LIST RIGHT AFTER HIGH SCHOOL TO COME HOME TO PURSUE A COLLEGE EDUCATION. PROVIDES YOU WITH SOME INCOME WHICH HELPS WITH THE COMPLICATIONS OF WORKING WHILE ATTENDING SCHOOL. AS IT TURNS OUT I HAD TO WORK FULL TIME IN ADDITION TO ATTENDING SCHOOL FULL TIME. THE GI BILL. CAN CHANGE VETERANS LIFE EDUCATION IS EMPOWERMENT. WASTE IN THIS BETTER BENEFIT IS A TRAGEDY. AFTER A MORE PROGRAMS TO TRANSITION VETERAN STRAIGHT INTO THE WORK FORCE WHAT THE NEW FOREVER GI BILL VETERANS WOULD BE ABLE TO SAVE THEIR COLLEGE BENEFIT OR PASS THEM ON TO THEIR CHILDREN. THIS WOULD INCREASE THE ECONOMIC OUTPUT FOR VETERANS. FOR OUR VETERANS AND THE BENEFIT OF AND IT BENEFITS THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY. THE ALTERNATIVE IS UNEMPLOYMENT AND STUDENT AT IN CONCLUSION OUR CLIENTS AND I WOULD LIKE TO STRESS THE NEED. TO PROTECT THE VIABILITY OF THE GI BILL BENEFITS. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT COLLEGES ARE NOT TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE VETERANS THAT DESERVE THIS BENEFIT. MANY ON VETERANS RETURN HOME AND ARE CONFUSED ON WHAT COURSE THEY SHOULD PERFECT. PURSUE. IN THEIR POST MILITARY LIFE. UNSCRUPULOUS MARKETING TACTICS AND SUB STANDARD CURRICULUM. CHEATS THE VETERANS ARE THE BENEFITS THEY'VE EARNED BY VIRTUE OF THEIR SERVICE. THE BILL WHOSE CALIFORNIA TO ENCOURAGE THE PROPER USE OF THE GI BILL BENEFITS. THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND FEDERAL MONIES COMING TO THE STATE FOR THE BENEFIT OF TRAINING OUR VETERANS TO FULLY PARTICIPATE IN SOCIETY. THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME LEVEL OVERSIGHT. OVER FOR PROFIT TRADE SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE PROVIDING THE ACTUAL. PRODUCT THEY THAT THEIR ADVERTISING WOULD LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME THIS OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THE COMMITTEE TODAY. ON THIS VERY IMPORTANT TOPIC TO CALIFORNIA VETERANS THANK YOU THANK YOU. UP THE STREET THANK YOU FOR SHARING. YOUR PERSONAL EXPERIENCES I THINK THAT REALLY HITS HOME AS TO WHY WE HAVE TO LOOK MORE CLOSELY AT THIS PROBLEM DO YOU STILL HAVE STUDENT LOANS. GOOD FOR YOU AFTER. GOING THROUGH ALL THAT. OF I GUESS THIS IS OF HER MS MONTGOMERY -- IT. YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE TALKING A LOT ABOUT HOW DO WE SEE WHAT THE EFFECTIVENESS IS OF A EDUCATION DO YOU THINK IT'S A DIFFICULT TO EVALUATE CLAIMS ABOUT A SCHOOL -- WITH THAT THE SCHOOL PROGRAMS LIABILITY IN THE MARKET. YES I THINK IT'S VERY DIFFICULT WE'VE HAD A LOT OF STUDENTS COME TO THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE ASKED AFTER THEY'VE WASTED A LOT OF BENEFITS IF NOT ALL OF THEIR BENEFITS AT A FOR PROFIT. AND I THINK IT'S VERY DIFFICULT IT'S ALSO VERY DIFFICULT ON THE VETERAN AS HE SO WELL STATED IS THAT -- WHEN THEY COME IN THEY THEY ALSO FACE ANOTHER KIND OF -- FEELING OF DISGRUNTLED AND ALSO FEELING OF I GOTTA START THIS ALL OVER AGAIN IT'S A VERY DISHEARTENING TO SEE A VETERAN COME IN AFTER THEY'VE TRIED SO HARD. AND THEY'VE LOST A MAJORITY OF THEIR BENEFITS AS OR THEY HAVE GONE FINANCIAL AID OR TAKE OUT LOANS TO TO COMPLETE THEIR EDUCATION AND THEY TRIED TO DO THAT AND WE'VE HAD SEVERAL OF THEM DO THAT AT MY LAST COLLEGES REDUCE AND IT COMING TO IRVINE. BUT AND WHAT ABOUT THE STUDENTS THAT ARE -- EITHER GRADUATING FROM THE AND TWO YEARS OF COLLEGE AND THEN GOING ON TO A FOUR YEAR PROGRAM YOU FOLLOWING ANY OF THEM SEE WHAT THEY'RE AND AND HERE'S THE PROBLEM WITH THAT. IS THAT BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE A SET GUIDELINE A STANDARD OF PRACTICE SO TO SPEAK IN ALL COMMUNITY COLLEGES BE VETERAN RESOURCE CENTERS ONLY A FEW OF US MAYBE A HANDFUL OUT OF THAT HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN ACTUALLY ARE ABLE TO FOLLOW THEIR STUDENTS FIND OUT WHERE THEY'RE GOING TO LOOK. AT THEIR COMPLETION THEIR PERSISTENCE RATES FIND OUT WHO'S DROPPING OUT WHO TO DO THE RESEARCH ON WHAT'S GOING ON THERE'S NOT A LOT OF INDIVIDUALS BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE COORDINATORS THEY DON'T HAVE STAFF AND THEIR MAYBE THEIR ACADEMIC COUNSELORS 25% OF THE TIME. OUR COLLEGE DOES FOLLOW THAT WE HAVE TO ACTUALLY THEY'RE JUST INTERVIEWED AT YALE WE HAD ONE THAT WENT TO STANFORD LAST YEAR WHICH IS HIGHLY HARD TO GET INTO WHEN YOU'RE TRANSFERRING IN AND FOUR YEAR LIKE THAT. ONE IS GOING AGAIN TO STAND FOR THIS YEAR THEY GO TO UNIVERSITY KENTUCKY WE HAD WE FOLLOW ALL OF THEM DOWN THE LINE WE FIND OUT WHERE THEY'RE GOING BECAUSE NEEDLESS TO SAY OUR ACADEMIC COUNSELOR RIGHTS THEIR LETTERS OF RECOMMENDATION AND THEN WE ARE ABLE TO FIND OUT WE HAVE. THIRTY TWO GRADUATING RIGHT TODAY WE'RE HAVING A GRADUATION PARTY WITH TALK OF MAN AT OUR COLLEGE -- AND SO THEY ARE. WE HAVE THE LIST OF THOSE NAMES AND WE KNOW EXACTLY WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THAT OTHER COLLEGES ARE NOT ABLE TO DO THAT BUT THAT SHOULD BE A STANDARD OF PRACTICE. SO -- I'M I'M WE KNOW IRVINE VALLEY IS A MODEL IF YOU LOOK AT THE OTHER COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND CALIFORNIA DO YOU THINK THAT THEY ARE OFFERING ENOUGH PROGRAMS OR CLASSES TO HELP VETERANS SIDE TRANSITION. SOME WHAT THEY'RE LOOKING AT I THINK THE PROBLEM THERE IS THAT. THEY DON'T HAVE THE SUPPORT SERVICES NOW SO TRANSITIONING NO. BUT THE COURSES HAVE TO BE THEY ALMOST NEED A CAREER ASSESSMENT BEFORE THEY LEAVE BASE TO FIND OUT WHAT THEY WANT TO DO. MY CONCERN IS THAT I HAVE. AN ELECTRICAL STE -- STUDENT COMES IN WITH A VAST AMOUNT OF ELECTRICAL EXPERIENCE THAT HE WAS TRAINED IN THE MARINE CORPS THERE HE COMES OUT NEEDS I HE'S WALKING OUT OF THE CENTER WITH ME AT MY LAST COLLEGE AND I SAID SO HOW ARE YOUR CLASSES DOING HE SAYS TO ME. WELL I'M FEELING EVERY CLASS I SAID WHOA LET'S STOP I SEE WHAT YOU MEAN YOU'RE FEELING EVERY CLASS HE SAYS YEAH I DON'T WANT TO BE HERE I WANT TO BE AN ELECTOR XIN NOBODY EVER ASKED ME. SO WHAT I WALKED HIM BACK IN AND I SAID FIND AN ELECTRICAL COLLEGE FOR HIM TO GO TO NOW HE ENDED UP TRANSFERRING TO PALOMAR BECAUSE THEY HAVE THAT TYPE OF PROGRAM THERE. SO EVERY COLLEGE IS DIFFERENT BECAUSE OF THE TYPE OF PROGRAMS THAT THEY OFFER SOME OFFER NURSING PROGRAMS WE HAVE SO MANY MEDICS AND CORPSMAN COMING OUT -- WITH MILITARY CREDITS THAT THEY SHOULD BE GIVEN FOR WHAT THEY'VE LEARNED ALSO IN THE MILITARY TO AND THAT'S A WHOLE NOTHER TOPIC THERE BUT BUT I THINK THAT IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE CAREER ASSESS FIND OUT WHERE THEY'RE GOING IF THEY DON'T KNOW THAT WE NEED TO HELP THEM FIGURE. THAT OUT AND KIND OF WITH SOME TYPE OF TESTING OR SOME TYPE OF ACADEMIC PROGRAMS THAT THEY CAN TAKEN FIGURED OUT WITHIN THE FIRST SEMESTER. YEAH WE NEED A FEW MORE OF YOU. TO YEAH THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL SO WHAT DO YOU THINK THE BIGGEST -- CHALLENGES THAT VETERANS FACE ENTERING THE CIVILIAN JOB MARKET. AND WHAT ALLEN DO YOU -- PREPARE THEM FOR THAT AS THROUGH THE PROGRAM THAT -- YOUR COLLEGE THEY NEED SOME TYPE OF INTERNSHIP. I THINK OUR WORKFORCE INVESTMENT MONEY SHOULD BE UTILIZED A LOT MORE EFFICIENTLY WITH VETERANS I BELIEVE THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE A LOT OF OPPORTUNITIES TO INTERNET DIFFERENT BIG COMPANIES THAT. AT EVENTHERE'S IN IRVINE THERE'S TACO BELL THERE'S EIGHTEEN T. ALL OF THEIR YOU KNOW THEIR BIG SATELLITE COMPANIES THERE THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO IN TURN IN THERE AND FIND OUT WHAT THEY REALLY WANT TO DO SEE IF THAT'S WHAT THEY WANTED. TO FIND OUT GO TO SOME OF THE ELECTRICAL UNIONS THE PLUMBING PIPE BANNERS AND AND GET SOME TYPE OF IF I HAVE OF THAT FROM COMING OUT THAT HAS BEEN. FOUR YEARS EXPERIENCE IN ELECTRICAL IN THE MARINES I SHOULD HAVE BE ABLE TO JUST PUT HIM RIGHT INTO THE ELECTRICAL UNION RIGHT THERE IN ORANGE COUNTY AND SAY YOU SHOULD BE WIPED OUT WITH IT'S A FIVE YEAR PROGRAM WIPED OUT WITH ONE AND A HALF TO YEARS. OF CREDIT NEEDLESS TO SAY THEY HAVE TAP COMPETENCY EXAMS TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE WHERE THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE AND THEN THEY GO RIGHT ON THROUGH AND FIGURE OUT THAT THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT TO DO. SO I THINK MORE OPPORTUNITY BUT WE NEED TO INVEST A LOT MORE TIME IN FIGURING OUT WHERE WE CAN ACTUALLY BRING THEM FROM THE MILITARY BECAUSE THEY HAVE SO MANY JOBS IN THE MILITARY LET'S FIGURE OUT WHICH ONE THEY LIKED THANK YOU. TERM. YES -- MY FIRST QUESTION -- SEC. DO YOU FEEL THAT YOU GOT ANYTHING OF OF PARTICULAR VALUE. THAT WAS HELPFUL TO YOU -- LIKE. USING YOUR GI BILL. I BELIEVE -- ALL EXPERIENCES THROUGH LIFE FOR VALUABLE -- I DO NOT FEEL LIKE. THE EDUCATION THAT I RECEIVED PROVIDED ME -- ANY BENEFIT TO MY FUTURE I WAS ABLE TO OBTAIN A JOB. WITH -- I I DID NOT NEED THAT EDUCATION TO ATTAIN THE JOB THAT I DID I COULD CAME IN OFF THE STREET. AND THEY WERE TO TRAIN ME -- THE SAME WAY THAT I WOULD HAVE GOTTEN. GOING TO THAT SCHOOL. WELL I I JUST WANNA SAY PERSONALLY THAT I I I FIND IN THE I THINK THE MAJOR THERE WAS HERE AT THE BEGINNING -- YOU KNOW IN THE TEST OF TESTIMONY THAT WE'VE HAD FROM YOU AND AND A COUPLE WEEKS BACK WHEN WE HEARD THE BILLS -- IS JUST SUCH A TRAGEDY NO NGUYEN AND TO REITERATE AGAIN THE WHEN WE ASK MEN AND WOMEN -- YOUNG PEOPLE. IN THIS COUNTRY TO PUT THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE -- TO SERVE THEIR COUNTRY AND THEN COME BACK. AND HAVE -- THEIR OPPORTUNITIES KIND OF STOLE STATE STOLEN FROM THEM. IS SUCH A A TRAGEDY AND I HOPE THAT THE WORK ON THIS COMMITTEE AND THE WORK. OF WITH MR VOEPEL AND MR FRAZIER THAT WE CAN. TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE KIND OF THINGS DON'T HAPPEN AGAIN. AND MY APOLOGIES THAT THAT HAPPENED TO YOU MY PERSONAL APOLOGIES -- TO A MAJOR TERRY. IS THE MILITARY DEPARTMENT WORKING TO GET THE WORD OUT ABOUT THE NEW -- MILITARY GI BILL. YES SIR IT IS AND AS A PERSON YOU CAN ACCESS THAT JUST WANTED TO TAKE A MOMENT TO THANK YOU. FOR MAKING IT SO MORE WIDELY AVAILABLE TO BE UTILIZED. BY A OUR NATIONAL GUARD MEMBERS AND OUR STATE MILITIA. AND FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO MIGHT NOT UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENCE. THE REGULAR MILITARY ACTIVE DUTY IS TITLE TEN TITLE. TEN IS A REQUIREMENT TO ACCESS THE FEDERAL GI BILL. WITH THE NATIONAL GUARD YOU HAVE TO GO ON MULTIPLE DEPLOYMENTS IN ORDER TO ACCESS THE FULL BENEFIT. OF THE FEDERAL GI BILL. IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE THE ANNUAL APPROPRIATION OF TWO POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. THAT WAS PREVIOUSLY PRETTY CONSTRAINED. AND AB TWENTY SEVEN TWENTY TWO OF LAST YEAR. LOOSEN THOSE REQUIREMENTS AND MADE IT. MUCH MORE ACCESSIBLE FOR MEMBERS OF OUR FORCE. PRIMARILY PEOPLE WHO RESPOND TO STATE EMERGENCIES LIKE THE CAMPFIRE. TO ACCESS THE BENEFITS JUST LIKE ANY OTHER DEPLOYED SERVICE MEMBER WOULD. SO YES HANNAH IN SHORT I WOULD SAY THAT WE ARE TRYING TO ADVERTISE THAT. THANK YOU. AND MY LAST QUESTION IS -- TO DEAN MONTGOMERY AND I I WANT TO SAY THIS THAT IF FIVE WAS A RETURNING -- VETERANS -- LOOKING TO USE MY GI BILL I'D WANT TO BE IT IRVINE VALLEY. AND AND I THINK I WOULD GET MY MONEY'S WORTH THEIR SO -- MY QUESTION. TO YOU DEMON JR MARIE. DO YOU FIND THAT THE AIR FORCE THE AIR FORCE -- THEY OFFER A COMMUNITY COLLEGE TRANSCRIPT IS IS THAT CORRECT YEAH. AND IS THAT -- IS THAT HELPFUL -- AT AT YOUR INSTITUTION -- THAT IS RIGHT RIGHT IF THE OTHER BRANCHES OF THE MILITARY. THEY DON'T OFFER THE SAME THING AND IF THEY DID WOULD THAT BE HELPFUL I THINK ALL OF THE TRANSCRIPTS ARE DIFFICULT TO DECIPHER. AND WHAT HAPPENS IS MY COLLEGE CAN OFFER A THREE UNIT ENGLISH COURSE WHICH CAN BE DIFFERENT THEN MY SISTER COLLEGE YOU CAN ALSO BE DIFFERENT THAN ANY OTHER COLLEGE IN THE SYSTEM. THERE FOR THE SAME THING HAPPENS WHEN YOU GET THOSE JOINT SERVICE TRANSCRIPT. THEY'RE ALL DIFFERENT SO THEY MAY ONLY GIVE TWO UNITS WE REQUIRE THREE UNITS TO TRANSFER SO THEREFORE THEY HAVE TO TAKE THE WHOLE. THE WHOLE COURSE OVER AGAIN SO SOMETIMES THEY'RE NOT THAT EASY TO TRANSFER OVER -- THAT'S WHY I STRONGLY FEEL THAT WE SHOULD GO TO SOME TYPE OF COMPETENCY TESTING WHEN THEY LOOK AT ANY TYPE OF A LEARNED ABILITIES THAT THEY'VE DONE OR ANY TYPE OF COLLEGE CREDIT THAT IS IN ANY MILITARY BRANCH I THINK THAT THAT'S IT'S IT'S RESPECTING WHAT THEY'VE LEARNED. IT'S ALSO NOT BASING THEIR KNOWLEDGE ON ON WHAT THEY CAN ACTUALLY COMPLETE AND DO AS THIS GENTLEMAN SAID WHEN YOU LOOK AT EVEN NURSING I LEARNED MORE ON HANDS THAN I EVER DID IN MY NURSING COURSES I LEARNED ALL THE BASIC THINGS BUT MY ON HANDS TRAINING TAUGHT ME. EVERYTHING AND I TAUGHT NURSING BUT THERE'S NO REASON FOR ME TO PUT. A MEDIC OR CORPSMAN IN THAT WHOLE FIRST SEMESTER OF NURSING SCHOOL WHEN THEY'RE GONNA LEARN HOW TO MAKE A BED AND PUT IN A CATHETER. BECAUSE THEY'VE ALREADY DONE FIVE MILLION OTHER THINGS TRAIPSING YOU KNOW SO DO PEOPLE UP WHEN THEY'RE ON THE FRONT LINES AND DONE FIVE MILLION OTHER THINGS. I THINK THAT WE NEED TO ANALYZE WHAT THOSE ARE AND MAYBE GIVE THEM CREDIT FOR TAKING THE COURSES IF THEY JUST PASS AN EXAM OR THEY CAN MEET THE REQUIREMENT OF THAT EXAM SO. IT BECOMES A LITTLE BIT MORE DETAILED CONVERSATION WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT THOSE TRANSCRIPTS. THANK YOU. SURE WILL COME. THANK YOU MISTER MADAM CHAI -- JUST A A QUICK CORTISOL HERE BEFORE WE WRAP WITH THIS UP -- LAST YEAR WAS A GOOD YEAR FOR THE VETERAN CENTER IS A TO COMMUNITY COLLEGES BECAUSE WITH EVERYONE'S HARD WORKING COOPERATION WE WERE ABLE TO GET I BELIEVE THE NEXT -- FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. NOW. COLLEAGUES HERE'S WHY THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE YOU'RE VETERANS CENTERS IS A PLACE FOR SOME SHELL SHOCKED. SAP LIKE ME TO GO AND JUST TALK TO OTHER VETERANS AND YOUR OTHER VETERANS WILL EITHER SQUARE YOU AWAY OR FEEL SORRY FOR YA OR WHATEVER COMBINATION YOU NEED AT THE TIME. AND THE REASON I BRING THIS UP. IS THERE IS A A MISSING PART HERE. AND I DON'T KNOW IF WE CAN DO ANYTHING AT THE STATE LEVEL OR THE VA LEVEL COLLEAGUES. BUT TWENTY TWO VETERANS COMMIT SUICIDE EVERY DAY [inaudible] AND MOST OF THE TIME IT'S BECAUSE THEY FEEL THEY'RE TRAPPED LIKE RATS THEY CAN'T. GET WHATEVER THEY HAVE TO GET -- AND I POINT OUT THIS IS NOT. DATA IT IS -- ENTERED TOTAL. BUT IT IS ESTIMATED THAT WOMEN. PER CAPITA COMMIT SUICIDE IT IS NOW I DON'T KNOW IF THAT SEXUAL HARASSMENT I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S HUMANOID REACTION TO PTSD AND STRESS AND EVERYTHING ELSE. BUT RIGHT NOW NO ONE IN THE VA IS RESEARCHING THAT. TO MY KNOWLEDGE SO I'M LOOKING AT THE CALIFORNIA LEVEL FOR YOU ALL TO THINK AND EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM TO THINK WHAT WE CAN WHAT CAN WE DO TO ADDRESS. THE WOMEN SUICIDE RATE. BECAUSE THEY'RE BEING NEGLECTED ANYWAY THAT'S ALL I HAD TO SAY. ABOUT THAT I FELL I FEEL LIKE I THE FOREST GUMP HERE. ASSEMBLYMEMBER I JUST LIKE TO ADDRESS THAT QUESTION THERE ACTUALLY WAS A REPORT THAT CAME OUT RECENTLY -- TWENTY SEVENTEEN NUMBERS A VETERAN SUICIDE IN CALIFORNIA -- AND I BELIEVE IT WAS AB TWO FOUR TWO FROM -- TWENTY SEVENTEEN WHICH PROVIDED THIS THE NUMBER FOR TWENTY SEVENTEEN WAS SIX HUNDRED FORTY VETERANS COMMITTED SUICIDE -- MOSTLY OLDER WHITE MALES WERE THE POPULATION HERE IN CALIFORNIA -- THAT COMMITTED SUICIDE AT THEIR HIGHEST RATES AND I WOULD BE HAPPY TO GET THAT REPORT TO YOUR OFFICE. BUT I'VE I'VE ONE OF ALL OF OUR SPEAKERS TODAY. I THINK WE'VE GOT SOME GREAT INSIGHT FROM YOU AND ALSO WANT TO THANK CHAIRMAN DANA WHO HAD -- TO TO LEAVE BUT HE WANTED TO MEET ALSO OVERLAY THAT HE'S VERY APPRECIATIVE OUR SPEAKER SO -- THANK YOU AND WE DO HAVE A CHANCE NOW FOR OF PUBLIC COMMENTS SO -- WE HAVE TWO MINUTES -- FOR PUBLIC COMMENTS. MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS ALEX TOWARDS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF VETERANS SERVICE AGENCIES VERY BRIEFLY I WOULD SAY WHEN YOU IT'S UNCONSCIONABLE WHEN YOU CONTRAST THE DEDICATION THE SACRIFICE OF VETERANS AND THE BUSINESS PRACTICES THEY'RE SUBJECTED TO UNDER LOOPHOLES -- OR OTHER ASPECTS OF LAW THAT HAVE YET TO BE ADDRESSED. I JUST WANTED TO ASK OUR SUPPORT FOR SOME OF THE BILLS -- REFERENCED EARLIER TODAY THAT ADDRESS -- DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT OF THESE BUSINESS -- PRACTICES ON VETERANS -- WE LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING THOSE BILLS GO THROUGH THE PROCESS LIKE THANK ALL THE MEMBERS -- FOR CONVENING THIS HEARING TODAY THANK YOU. MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS -- RICHARD BENSON I AM A STUDENT AT CARRINGTON COLLEGE SACRAMENTO CAMPUS AND I JUST I JUST WANTED TO SHARE. MY SUCCESS THAT I'VE ACTUALLY HAD WITH USING THE GI BILL -- SINCE GETTING OUT IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN I WAS ABLE. TO NOT ONLY GO THROUGH THE POLICE ACADEMY AND NAPA -- BUT ALSO KNOCK OUT A FEW. GENERAL ED CLASSES THAT TRANSFERRED OVER TO US TO CARRINGTON COLLEGE. AND SINCE THEN I AM ABOUT SIX WEEKS AWAY FROM GRADUATING. ANDI HAVE ZERO STUDENT LOANS AND I FEEL THAT HAVING THIS GI BILL HAS BEEN A HUGE SUCCESS FOR ME AND IT'S HELP ME KEEP MY LIFE. ON TRACK SINCE GETTING OUT. AND THE FACT THAT I DON'T HAVE ANY STUDENT LOANS AND I'M ABOUT TO GRADUATE AND GO INTO A FIELD WHERE I ALREADY HAVE A JOB IS. IS. AMAZING AND I JUST WANTED TO SHARE THAT LITTLE EXPERIENCE WITH CARRINGTON HOW THEY'VE ALWAYS THEY'VE BEEN VERY. SUPPORTIVE AND NEVER PUSHY WITH.
