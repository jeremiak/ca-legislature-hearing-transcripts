KINDS OF SYSTEM IMPROVEMENTS

00:45:59.223 --> 00:46:00.924
ARE RISING AS A HIGHER

00:46:00.991 --> 00:46:03.160
PRIORITY. GIVEN THAT THERE ARE

00:46:03.227 --> 00:46:05.162
PRESSURES WITHIN THE AGING

00:46:05.229 --> 00:46:07.531

OUR RULES OF DATING APARTMENTS

00:46:18.775 --> 00:46:19.443
TO BE THAT PERSON CENTERED

00:46:19.510 --> 00:46:21.345
FOCUS ACROSS MULTIPLE SYSTEMS

00:46:21.411 --> 00:46:23.413
SO IS CLEARLY THE SERVICES AND

00:46:23.480 --> 00:46:26.283
SUPPORTS FOR- UP ALL OF US AS

00:46:26.350 --> 00:46:27.985
WE AGE WHICH ARE AT HEALTHCARE

00:46:28.051 --> 00:46:29.653
SERVICES AND SOCIAL SERVICES AN

00:46:29.720 --> 00:46:31.889
AGING. OF THE NEED FOR MORE

00:46:31.955 --> 00:46:33.957
PERSON CENTERED CARE SO THAT

00:46:34.024 --> 00:46:34.791
THOSE SERVICES ARE AVAILABLE

00:46:34.858 --> 00:46:36.260
EVERY COUNTY AND THEY'RE

00:46:36.326 --> 00:46:39.363
AFFORDABLE- IS CLEARLY. IN PART

00:46:39.429 --> 00:46:40.531
BECAUSE THIS REPORT WAS DUE

00:46:40.597 --> 00:46:41.665
FIRST HAS COME UP LOUD AND

00:46:41.732 --> 00:46:42.966
CLEAR BUT IN PART BECAUSE IT'S

00:46:43.033 --> 00:46:44.201
A REAL CRISIS WE HEAR IT EVERY

00:46:44.268 --> 00:46:46.136
FORUM OF PEOPLE WITH A TERRIBLE

00:46:46.203 --> 00:46:47.905
CHOICES IN TERRIBLE OUTCOMES

00:46:47.971 --> 00:46:49.740
AND SO THAT NO DOUBT I'D SAY ON

00:46:49.806 --> 00:46:51.975
THE THREE OTHER ONES THAT ARE.

00:46:52.042 --> 00:46:53.243
VERY STRIKING OR AGAIN THE VIEW

00:46:53.310 --> 00:46:55.546
CYNICAL ACT- BOTH IN TERMS OF

00:46:55.612 --> 00:46:56.680
THE FINANCIAL EXPLOITATION

00:46:56.747 --> 00:46:58.582
OFTEN- FAMILY OFTEN ONLINE

00:46:58.649 --> 00:47:00.784
OFTEN HOME IMPROVEMENT AND THEN

00:47:00.851 --> 00:47:02.452
AGAIN I'M NOT COMFORTABLE WITH

00:47:02.519 --> 00:47:03.620
THIS TERM OF SELF NEGLECT

00:47:03.687 --> 00:47:04.621
BECAUSE IT REALLY IS THAT

00:47:04.688 --> 00:47:05.389
SOUNDS LIKE THE PERSON'S

00:47:05.455 --> 00:47:06.823
HARMING THEMSELVES WHEN IN FACT

00:47:06.890 --> 00:47:08.425
WHAT IT IS A LACK OF RESOURCES

00:47:08.492 --> 00:47:09.493
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH RESOURCES

00:47:09.560 --> 00:47:11.528
FINANCIAL RESOURCES. SO THOSE

00:47:11.595 --> 00:47:13.597
ARE VERY CONCERNING TO ME THOSE

00:47:13.664 --> 00:47:15.999
URGENT CASES- WERE ALWAYS

00:47:16.066 --> 00:47:17.601
KEEPING OUR MIND ON EMERGENCY

00:47:17.668 --> 00:47:19.636
PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE FOR

00:47:19.703 --> 00:47:20.871
ACCESSAND FUNCTIONAL NEEDS

00:47:20.938 --> 00:47:22.339
WHETHER ITS FIRES EARTHQUAKES

00:47:22.406 --> 00:47:24.041
POWERSHOT OFFICE I'M WORKING

00:47:24.107 --> 00:47:25.242
WITH YES THERE'S MORE WE NEED

00:47:25.309 --> 00:47:28.745
TO DO TO HELP US ALL PREPARED-

00:47:28.812 --> 00:47:30.547
YOU KNOW IMAGINING HAVING TO GO

00:47:30.614 --> 00:47:31.582
THROUGH THE ACTIVATION ORDER

00:47:31.648 --> 00:47:32.916
WHEN YOU NO LONGER CAN DRIVE

00:47:32.983 --> 00:47:34.518
WHAT IS A REAL PLAN FOR THAT

00:47:34.585 --> 00:47:36.086
AND GIVEN THE RISK OF FIDELITY

00:47:36.153 --> 00:47:37.854
IS WITH OLDER ADULTS. AND THEN

00:47:37.921 --> 00:47:39.323
I THINK WE'RE ALL WRESTLING

00:47:39.389 --> 00:47:41.558
WITH THIS NOTION OF WHAT YOU

00:47:41.625 --> 00:47:44.294
CALL ISOLATION OR AGEISM. BUT

00:47:44.361 --> 00:47:45.862
THE FACT THAT WE ARE NOT FULLY

00:47:45.929 --> 00:47:47.297
MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITIES AS

00:47:47.364 --> 00:47:48.932

LEADS TO ALL KINDS OF

00:47:53.136 --> 00:47:56.740
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. IMPACT AND

00:47:56.807 --> 00:47:57.441
SO. RANGING FROM THE PRESS ALL

00:47:57.507 --> 00:47:58.342
THROUGH TO. RISING SO. RATES

00:47:58.408 --> 00:48:00.110
AMONG OLDER ADULTS. AND SO WHEN

00:48:00.177 --> 00:48:02.346
YOU THOSE ARE ALL. PERSON

00:48:02.412 --> 00:48:04.281
CENTERED- CRISES THAT REQUIRE

00:48:04.348 --> 00:48:05.549
ALL OF US TO COME TOGETHER IN

00:48:05.616 --> 00:48:07.417
NEW WAYS SO WE HAVE NEW EFFORTS

00:48:07.484 --> 00:48:08.485
ON L. TSS WE HAVE NEW

00:48:08.552 --> 00:48:10.020
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH TASK FORCE WE

00:48:10.087 --> 00:48:11.154
HAVE. BETTER THAN EVER

00:48:11.221 --> 00:48:12.956
EMERGENCY COORDINATION. I'LL

00:48:13.023 --> 00:48:14.591
BUT CLEARLY THERE'S MORE TO DO

00:48:14.658 --> 00:48:16.126
SO ALL OF THOSE POINTS. AND

00:48:16.193 --> 00:48:18.061
THEN AND I WOULD JUST A CROSS

00:48:18.128 --> 00:48:19.096
CUTTING. IT'S CLEAR THAT THE

00:48:19.162 --> 00:48:20.797
INCREASING COGNITIVE ISSUES IS

00:48:20.864 --> 00:48:22.466
STRAINING ALL OF OUR SYSTEMS.

00:48:22.532 --> 00:48:24.301
THE NONE OF OUR SYSTEMS WELL

NUMBERS OF PEOPLE WITH DEMENTIA

00:48:29.339 --> 00:48:31.575
HOW ARE WE GOING TO- HAVE THE

00:48:31.642 --> 00:48:32.776

EXPERIENCE- AND OF COURSE

00:48:38.782 --> 00:48:41.618
pWELL. BUT I THINK THOSE ARE

00:48:41.685 --> 00:48:43.687

OUR CURRENT SYSTEM GAPS. SO I

00:50:08.171 --> 00:50:09.172
WOULD SAY THAT YOU KNOW WE'VE

00:50:09.239 --> 00:50:10.574
GIVEN A LOT OF THOUGHT ON THE

00:50:10.640 --> 00:50:13.009
SUBCOMMITTEE ABOUT HOW THEY

00:50:13.076 --> 00:50:14.244
NEED TO REALLY LOOK ACROSS THE

00:50:14.311 --> 00:50:16.780
FIVE OBJECTIVES AND- ADDRESS

00:50:16.847 --> 00:50:18.982
THE PRIORITIES AND THE MORE THE

00:50:19.049 --> 00:50:20.817
IMMEDIATE ACTION ITEMS WITH IN

00:50:20.884 --> 00:50:22.519
EACH OF THOSE SO. MORE

00:50:22.586 --> 00:50:24.087
SPECIFICALLY THERE IS A CHART

00:50:24.154 --> 00:50:27.491
HERE THIRTY SEVEN IMMEDIATE

00:50:27.557 --> 00:50:28.091
ACTION ITEMS THAT CAN BE ACTED

00:50:28.158 --> 00:50:31.094
ON AND- I WOULD SAY THAT

00:50:31.161 --> 00:50:33.096
THERE'S REALLY NOT A LEVEL OF

00:50:33.163 --> 00:50:34.931
IMPORTANCE THAT HAS BEEN SUCH A

00:50:34.998 --> 00:50:36.833
SIGN TO EACH BUT THE MOST

00:50:36.900 --> 00:50:38.902
CRITICAL ISSUES IS RIGHT NOW

00:50:38.969 --> 00:50:40.537
PEOPLE DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO

00:50:40.604 --> 00:50:42.372
GET THE INFORMATION THEY NEED

00:50:42.439 --> 00:50:43.340
TO MAKE DECISIONS. THAT'S WHAT

00:50:43.407 --> 00:50:45.308
THE ISSUE BUT ONE IF THEY HAVE

00:50:45.375 --> 00:50:46.209
THE RIGHT INFORMATION THEY

00:50:46.276 --> 00:50:48.044
CAN'T ACCESS THE SUPPORTS THEY

00:50:48.111 --> 00:50:49.846
NEED SO WE HAVE MANY AREAS IN

00:50:49.913 --> 00:50:52.783
THE STATE WE A LACK OF

00:50:52.849 --> 00:50:54.050

00:50:54.117 --> 00:50:55.652
GET WHAT THEY NEED IF THEY HAVE

00:50:55.719 --> 00:50:57.721
THE RIGHT INFORMATION BUT THEN

00:50:57.788 --> 00:50:59.589
THIRD AS HAS BEEN DISCUSSED AS

00:50:59.656 --> 00:51:03.160
PEOPLE CAN AFFORD TO. THERE

00:51:03.226 --> 00:51:05.262
RUSHED AND IF WE ARE FOURTH WE

00:51:05.328 --> 00:51:07.164

00:51:15.105 --> 00:51:17.507
BUT THEN ALSO IMPORTANTLY I'M

00:51:17.574 --> 00:51:20.744
KIND OF OVER ARCHING ALL THIS

00:51:20.811 --> 00:51:21.812
IS THE NEED FOR LEADERSHIP AND

00:51:21.878 --> 00:51:22.712

01:01:52.708 --> 01:01:53.176
ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT

01:01:53.242 --> 01:01:54.343
THINGS IS THE INTERACTIVE

01:01:54.410 --> 01:01:56.446

TODAY I THINK- YOU KNOW WE HAVE

01:16:55.110 --> 01:16:57.245
A- A STATUTE THAT'S BEEN IN

01:16:57.312 --> 01:16:59.381
PLACE SINCE NINETEEN NINETY TWO

01:16:59.448 --> 01:17:00.482
ALMOST THIRTY YEARS- THAT.

01:17:00.549 --> 01:17:03.251
CREATES A PROCESS BY WHICH- A

01:17:03.318 --> 01:17:04.553
GROWING NUMBER OF PATIENTS AND

01:17:04.619 --> 01:17:05.587
SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES HAVE

01:17:05.654 --> 01:17:08.123

01:17:09.491 --> 01:17:10.692
WHEN THEY DON'T HAVE THAT

01:17:10.759 --> 01:17:12.361
CAPABILITY AND THEY DON'T HAVE

UPHELD THAT PROCESS- AND I

01:17:18.467 --> 01:17:19.501
THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT FOR US

01:17:19.568 --> 01:17:20.969
TO KNOW THAT THAT PROCESS CAN'T

01:17:21.036 --> 01:17:22.604
CONTINUE I AM IT'S JUST THEY

01:17:22.671 --> 01:17:24.973

01:17:26.675 --> 01:17:27.909
HAPPEN WITHIN THAT PROCESS ONE

01:17:27.976 --> 01:17:31.613
IS IT. THAT THERE'S CLEAR

01:17:31.680 --> 01:17:32.247
NOTIFICATION TO THE PATIENT AND

01:17:32.314 --> 01:17:33.782

01:17:37.853 --> 01:17:38.887
HAS DETERMINED THAT A PATIENT

01:17:38.954 --> 01:17:40.956
IS INCAPACITATED AND THE SECOND

01:17:41.023 --> 01:17:41.990
PART IN THE PART OF THE REASON

01:17:42.057 --> 01:17:44.159
THAT WE'RE HERE TODAY- IS THAT

01:17:44.226 --> 01:17:46.862

01:17:46.928 --> 01:17:48.930
FROM THE COURT THAT IN ALL

01:17:48.997 --> 01:17:51.199

01:18:05.180 --> 01:18:06.048
PART OF THAT. THEY ARE IN A

01:18:06.114 --> 01:18:12.320
CERTAIN MAKER THEY ARE NOT. A

01:18:12.387 --> 01:18:14.656

IN SUPPORT. I DON'T KNOW THAT

01:24:17.886 --> 01:24:19.687
I'M STANDING IN OPPOSITION TO

01:24:19.754 --> 01:24:20.889
THE OFFICE OF THE PATIENT

01:24:20.955 --> 01:24:23.825
ADVOCATE. BUT I DO CHALLENGED

01:24:23.892 --> 01:24:26.294
THAT I. AND WE HAVE BEEN

01:24:26.361 --> 01:24:28.463
WORKING WITH WITH A BIT

01:24:28.530 --> 01:24:31.533
DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS. IF THIS

01:24:31.599 --> 01:24:33.368
IS THE APPROPRIATE THING TO DO

01:24:33.435 --> 01:24:35.136
TO CREATE YET ANOTHER STATE

01:24:35.203 --> 01:24:38.406
OFFICE- WE WOULD ARGUE THAT

01:24:38.473 --> 01:24:39.874
THESE PEOPLE NEED TO BE

01:24:39.941 --> 01:24:42.510
CONSERVED AND THE CONSERVATIVE

01:24:42.577 --> 01:24:45.480
TEA PROCESS AS IT IS TODAY

01:24:45.547 --> 01:24:48.950
TAKES TOO LONG. BUT BECAUSE THE

01:24:49.017 --> 01:24:50.718
SYSTEM WE HAVETAKES TOO LONG

01:24:50.785 --> 01:24:52.053
IS NOT NECESSARILY A

01:24:52.120 --> 01:24:54.689
JUSTIFICATION FOR THE CREATION

01:24:54.756 --> 01:24:56.825
OF YET ANOTHER STATE ENTITY. I

01:24:56.891 --> 01:24:59.928
DO THINK THAT- THERE'S DUELING

01:24:59.994 --> 01:25:01.996
LAWYERS OPINIONS AT THIS POINT

01:25:02.063 --> 01:25:04.365
ON WHAT THIS COURT CASE SAYS

01:25:04.432 --> 01:25:09.003
AND THAT RATHER THAN DECIDING.

01:25:09.070 --> 01:25:11.439
A COURSE OF ACTION THAT WE NEED

01:25:11.506 --> 01:25:12.774
TO TAKE A STEP BACK WE NEED TO

01:25:12.841 --> 01:25:14.008
ASK THE CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY

01:25:14.075 --> 01:25:15.276
GENERAL TO ACTUALLY LOOK AT

01:25:15.343 --> 01:25:17.245
THIS DECISION WE NEED TO ASK

01:25:17.312 --> 01:25:18.580
THE DEPARTMENT OF A PUBLIC

01:25:18.646 --> 01:25:20.648
HEALTH TO DO A CENSUS OF POINT

01:25:20.715 --> 01:25:22.083
AND COUNT. A POINT IN TIME

01:25:22.150 --> 01:25:24.018
COUNT HOW MANY RESIDENTS ARE WE

01:25:24.085 --> 01:25:26.120
REALLY TALKING ABOUT WE DON'T

01:25:26.187 --> 01:25:28.289
HAVE. I MAY BE WRONG BUT I DO

01:25:28.356 --> 01:25:29.824
NOT BELIEVE WE HAVE A SKILLED

01:25:29.891 --> 01:25:30.859
NURSING FACILITY IN EVERY

01:25:30.925 --> 01:25:32.927
COUNTY SO WHY WOULD WE WANT TO

01:25:32.994 --> 01:25:35.363
HAVE AN OFFICE OF A PATIENT

01:25:35.430 --> 01:25:36.164
ADVOCATE IN A COUNTY THAT

01:25:36.231 --> 01:25:38.366
DOESN'T HAVE A NURSING FACILITY.

01:25:38.433 --> 01:25:40.301
WE CAME BEFORE YOU FOR SO MANY

01:25:40.368 --> 01:25:41.903
YEARS TO GET FIVE MILLION

01:25:41.970 --> 01:25:44.539
DOLLARS. I AM I'M JUST

01:25:44.606 --> 01:25:46.241
CONCERNED IS THIS REALLY THE

01:25:46.307 --> 01:25:48.176
BEST APPROACH- BUT I DO

01:25:48.243 --> 01:25:49.811
RECOGNIZE THAT SOMETHING HAS TO

01:25:49.878 --> 01:25:53.314
BE DONE. FUNDAMENTALLY AT THE

01:25:53.381 --> 01:25:54.816
END OF THE DAY A PERSON THAT

01:25:54.883 --> 01:25:56.751
HAS NO VOICE AND HAS NO ONE TO

01:25:56.818 --> 01:25:58.286
SPEAK FOR THEM IS THE MOST

01:25:58.353 --> 01:26:00.555
VULNERABLE PERSON AND SO. I

01:26:00.622 --> 01:26:01.956
DON'T THINK WE WOULD EVER SAY

01:26:02.023 --> 01:26:02.624
THAT THEY DON'T NEED TO BE

01:26:02.690 --> 01:26:04.492
REPRESENTED BUT I'M NOT SURE

01:26:04.559 --> 01:26:06.127
THAT THIS PROPOSAL IS THE BEST

01:26:06.194 --> 01:26:09.230
APPROACH. THANK YOU MA'AM.

01:26:09.297 --> 01:26:10.598
SEEING NO FURTHER PUBLIC

01:26:10.665 --> 01:26:11.900
COMMENT I'LL BRING IT UP TO THE

01:26:11.966 --> 01:26:14.035
SUB COMMITTEE. AND IF I CAN I'D

01:26:14.102 --> 01:26:17.071
LIKE TO ASK THE SPONSORS FIRST.

01:26:17.138 --> 01:26:18.006
HAVE YOU BEEN GIVEN ANY

01:26:18.072 --> 01:26:20.909
FEEDBACK FROM THE TRIPLE A.'S

01:26:20.975 --> 01:26:24.112
ON WHAT'S BEING PROPOSED- ON

01:26:24.178 --> 01:26:29.050
THE LOCAL SIDE TO THIS CONCEPT.

01:26:29.117 --> 01:26:30.318
I CAN SPEAK ON BEHALF OF MY

01:26:30.385 --> 01:26:31.452
CLIENT CALPERS DECISION

01:26:31.519 --> 01:26:33.087
HELPLESSLY AS WE DID WE HAVE

01:26:33.154 --> 01:26:34.022
MET WITH THE TRIPLE A AS I KNOW

01:26:34.088 --> 01:26:36.457
THAT- THERE'S ALSO- SENATOR PAN

01:26:36.524 --> 01:26:39.027
HAS EGISLATION SB TEN FORTY

01:26:39.093 --> 01:26:39.727
THREE THAT'S ALSO LOOKING AT

01:26:39.794 --> 01:26:40.695
THE PRACTICALITIES OF

01:26:40.762 --> 01:26:41.863
IMPLEMENTATION AND THEY'VE BUT

01:26:41.930 --> 01:26:43.097
THEY WERE INVOLVED IN A RECENT

01:26:43.164 --> 01:26:45.833
MEETING- I CAN'T SPEAK FOR THE

01:26:45.900 --> 01:26:48.403
TRIPLE A.'S BUT I HAVE NOT. THE

01:26:48.469 --> 01:26:50.238
LEAST THE INITIAL RESPONSE WAS

01:26:50.305 --> 01:26:53.041
NOT OPPOSITION TO THIS IDEA- I

01:26:53.107 --> 01:26:57.412
THINK THE ENVISIONING IS THAT.

01:26:57.478 --> 01:27:00.982
THIS THIS THIS OFFICE WOULD NOT

01:27:01.049 --> 01:27:01.649
BE A LARGE STRUCTURE OF ANY

01:27:01.716 --> 01:27:02.917
KIND IT WOULD JUST BE A-

01:27:02.984 --> 01:27:04.519
FACILITATOR OF MAKING SURE THAT

01:27:04.586 --> 01:27:06.354
IN EVERY. IN AREAS WHERE IT'S

01:27:06.421 --> 01:27:09.223
NEEDED- IT COULD DEPEND ON THE

01:27:09.290 --> 01:27:10.525
STRUCTURE OF EACH COUNTY HOW

01:27:10.592 --> 01:27:12.360
THEY CURRENTLY HANDLES THEIR

01:27:12.427 --> 01:27:13.861
THEIR AGING OR SENIOR PROGRAMS

01:27:13.928 --> 01:27:14.929
THAT THERE IS SOMEBODY THERE

01:27:14.996 --> 01:27:15.563
THAT CAN TAKE ON THAT

01:27:15.630 --> 01:27:17.498
RESPONSIBILITY FOR NURSING HOME

01:27:17.565 --> 01:27:19.901
GIVE THEM A CALL- SO- I CAN'T

01:27:19.968 --> 01:27:21.202
SPEAK FOR THE TRIP LAZILY SOME.

01:27:21.269 --> 01:27:23.104
OUR INITIAL DISCUSSIONS WE

01:27:23.171 --> 01:27:24.339
HAVEN'T HEARD STRONG OPPOSITION

01:27:24.405 --> 01:27:26.674
TO THAT- TO BOTH THE-

01:27:26.741 --> 01:27:28.076
CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF AGING

01:27:28.142 --> 01:27:29.444
AS WELL AS DEPARTMENT OF

01:27:29.510 --> 01:27:31.379
FINANCE. GIVEN THIS COURT

01:27:31.446 --> 01:27:34.449
DECISION HAS THE ESTABLISHMENT

01:27:34.515 --> 01:27:36.250
OF THE OFFICE OR SOMETHING.

01:27:36.317 --> 01:27:38.286
THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS.

01:27:38.353 --> 01:27:39.854
ACTIVELY CONSIDERING GOING

01:27:39.921 --> 01:27:42.790
FORWARD. WITH YES AS OTHERS

01:27:42.857 --> 01:27:44.092
HAVE SAID THAT THE LEAD ON THIS

01:27:44.158 --> 01:27:45.093
IS THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH AND

01:27:45.159 --> 01:27:46.594
HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY BECAUSE

01:27:46.661 --> 01:27:48.796
IT INVOLVES. A PUBLIC HEALTH

01:27:48.863 --> 01:27:49.931
DEPARTMENT OF AGING THE OFFICE

01:27:49.998 --> 01:27:51.165
A LONG TERM CARE BUT SEVERAL

01:27:51.232 --> 01:27:53.001
PARTS OF OUR AGENCY FAMILY AND

01:27:53.067 --> 01:27:54.736
WE HAVE HAD ONGOING CREATIVE

01:27:54.802 --> 01:27:56.204
COLLABORATIVE CONVERSATIONS

01:27:56.270 --> 01:27:57.505
ABOUT HOW TO INTERPRET THIS.

01:27:57.572 --> 01:27:58.840
DECISION AND HOW TO BEST

01:27:58.906 --> 01:27:59.874
RESPOND TO AND I BELIEVE THOSE

01:27:59.941 --> 01:28:01.976
CONVERSATIONS CONTINUE- ANY

01:28:02.043 --> 01:28:04.112
INSIGHT YOU CAN PROVIDE ON HOW

01:28:04.178 --> 01:28:05.713
THOSE CONVERSATIONS ARE GOING

01:28:05.780 --> 01:28:06.781
WHICH ARE DIFFERENT THAN THE

01:28:06.848 --> 01:28:08.616
PROPOSAL WE'RE HEARING HERE

01:28:08.683 --> 01:28:10.385
TODAY. THIS IS ONE OF THE ONES

01:28:10.451 --> 01:28:12.186
IN THE MIX I THINK AS AS MY

01:28:12.253 --> 01:28:13.521
FELLOW PANELISTS HAVE SAID

01:28:13.588 --> 01:28:15.590
IT'S- WE'RE WORKING THROUGH THE

01:28:15.657 --> 01:28:17.158
OPERATIONAL THE LOGISTICAL

01:28:17.225 --> 01:28:19.827
LEGAL. FISCAL IT BUT IT'S

01:28:19.894 --> 01:28:22.330
CERTAINLY IN THE MIX IN THIS

01:28:22.397 --> 01:28:22.930
CONVERSATION A FAIR REFLECTION

01:28:22.997 --> 01:28:26.334
OF AND- I'VE HEARD IT ALLUDED

01:28:26.401 --> 01:28:28.169
TO WHEN I DON'T MEAN TO ASK.

01:28:28.236 --> 01:28:30.605
LONG TERM- BUT THE MAN TO TAKE

01:28:30.672 --> 01:28:33.307
ON MORE RESPONSIBILITIES THAN.

01:28:33.374 --> 01:28:34.809
ARE ALREADY BEFORE THEM AND

01:28:34.876 --> 01:28:37.178
THEY MAY BE PRECLUDED FROM IT.

01:28:37.245 --> 01:28:38.980
BUT I AM SENSITIVE TO THE FACT

01:28:39.047 --> 01:28:40.381
THAT WE WILL FINALLY GAVE THEM

01:28:40.448 --> 01:28:42.216
AN INCREASE LAST YEAR AND WILL

01:28:42.283 --> 01:28:44.619
BE ASKING. MUCH MORE IF WE

01:28:44.686 --> 01:28:46.487
WOULD ASK THEM TO TAKE ON THIS

01:28:46.554 --> 01:28:48.589
RESPONSIBILITY IF THEY COULD

01:28:48.656 --> 01:28:50.925
EVEN TO THIS AND SO- DO THINK

01:28:50.992 --> 01:28:52.293
WE NEED SOMEONE WHO'S-

01:28:52.360 --> 01:28:54.128
ADVOCATING AT THE BEDSIDE AND

01:28:54.195 --> 01:28:56.764
JUST WOULD ASK- THE DEPARTMENTS

01:28:56.831 --> 01:28:58.332
TO WORK WITH US TO FIGURE OUT

01:28:58.399 --> 01:28:59.367
WHAT WE COULD DO BEST WITH

01:28:59.434 --> 01:29:00.535
THAT. SO WITH THAT WE WILL HOLD

01:29:00.601 --> 01:29:04.205
ISSUE. TO EAT OPEN AND MOVE ON

01:29:04.272 --> 01:29:13.481

PROGRESSION OF THE DISEASE

IN ITSELF HAS MADE A LOT

02:22:46.691 --> 02:22:47.959
INVESTMENTS AND I SUGGEST WITH

MINIMUM WAGE INCREASES DUE TO A

02:22:53.431 --> 02:22:54.866

02:23:33.438 --> 02:23:35.006
HAVE A SHARE OF COSTS ONE WAY.

02:23:35.073 --> 02:23:36.341
WHEN THEY HAVE A NEW INCREASE

02:23:36.407 --> 02:23:38.443
IN THEIR WAGES SO BUT WE DON'T

02:23:38.509 --> 02:23:40.111

OF DISCUSSIONS IN THIS VERY

02:34:59.657 --> 02:35:00.991
ROOM ON HOW WE WOULD BEST

02:35:01.058 --> 02:35:03.327
INCENTIVIZE COUNTIES TO ENTERED

02:35:03.394 --> 02:35:05.029
TO THESE MUCH NEEDED COLLECTIVE

02:35:05.095 --> 02:35:06.897
BARGAINING AGREEMENTS WITH THE

02:35:06.964 --> 02:35:09.066
IMPERATIVE WORKFORCE THAT IS A

02:35:09.133 --> 02:35:12.236
TO SAYS I HSS PROVIDERS. OUR

02:35:12.302 --> 02:35:14.138
CONCLUSION WAS TO ESTABLISH A

02:35:14.204 --> 02:35:17.074
ONE TIME FISCAL PENALTY OF 1%

02:35:17.141 --> 02:35:20.177
OF THE COUNTIES I HSS MOE FOR

02:35:20.244 --> 02:35:22.112
COUNTIES WHO DID NOT ENTER INTO

02:35:22.179 --> 02:35:22.946
COLLECTIVE BARGAINING

02:35:23.013 --> 02:35:25.716
AGREEMENTS PRIOR TO A CERTAIN

02:35:25.783 --> 02:35:28.085
DATE. UNFORTUNATELY THE STILL

02:35:28.152 --> 02:35:29.453
VERY LITTLE TO MOVE MOST

02:35:29.520 --> 02:35:31.455
COUNTIES TO ENTER INTO

02:35:31.522 --> 02:35:32.089
COLLECTIVE BARGAINING

02:35:32.156 --> 02:35:34.124
AGREEMENTS WHILE THE STICK

02:35:34.191 --> 02:35:35.426
VERSUS CARROT APPROACH WOULD BE

02:35:35.492 --> 02:35:37.795
HELPFUL IN THEORY THE REALITY

02:35:37.861 --> 02:35:40.297
IS A ONE TIME PENALTY OF THAT

02:35:40.364 --> 02:35:42.332
SIZE DID NOT WORK AS AN

02:35:42.399 --> 02:35:44.468
INCENTIVE FOR MANY COUNTIES. IN

02:35:44.535 --> 02:35:47.004
SOME CASES IT WAS CHEAPER TO

02:35:47.071 --> 02:35:49.540
PAY THE 1% PENALTY RATHER THAN

02:35:49.606 --> 02:35:51.742
NEGOTIATE IN GOOD FAITH. THIS

02:35:51.809 --> 02:35:53.043
IS WHY WE ARE ASKING THAT THE

02:35:53.110 --> 02:35:54.778
ONE TIME FISCAL PENALTY BE

02:35:54.845 --> 02:35:57.514

7% OF THE COUNTIES I. H. S. S.

02:36:00.384 --> 02:36:02.219
M. O. E. THIS WILL HOPEFULLY

02:36:02.286 --> 02:36:04.154
PUSHED COUNTIES WHO PREVIOUSLY

02:36:04.221 --> 02:36:06.056
WORKED FINALIZING THE

02:36:06.123 --> 02:36:06.824
COLLECTIVE BARGAINING

02:36:06.890 --> 02:36:09.626
AGREEMENTS. TO FINALIZE THEM.

02:36:09.693 --> 02:36:11.361
WE CANNOT KEEP PUSHING OF

02:36:11.428 --> 02:36:12.696
COLLECTIVE BARGAINING

02:36:12.763 --> 02:36:14.364
AGREEMENTS FOR A WORKFORCE THAT

02:36:14.431 --> 02:36:16.900
IS SO CRUCIAL FOR SO MANY

02:36:16.967 --> 02:36:19.103
CALIFORNIANS IT IS IMPERATIVE

02:36:19.169 --> 02:36:20.704
THAT WE TAKE EVERY STEP TO

02:36:20.771 --> 02:36:23.140
SUPPORT AYE HSS FIGHTERS. IN

02:36:23.207 --> 02:36:24.308

YOU A- THANK YOU- AGAIN MISTER

02:36:30.514 --> 02:36:32.149
CHAIR AT EIGHTY I THINK IT'S

02:36:32.216 --> 02:36:34.318
IMPORTANT TO TAKE THIS FROM A

02:36:34.384 --> 02:36:36.620
HOLISTIC PERSPECTIVE- WE HAVE

02:36:36.687 --> 02:36:38.856
ACTUATION SO WHERE COUNTIES

02:36:38.922 --> 02:36:40.691
HAVE MADE CLEAR THAT THEY DO

02:36:40.758 --> 02:36:44.828
NOT PRIORITIZE I JUST SAYS THEY

02:36:44.895 --> 02:36:46.497
ACTUALLY BUYS THE FACT THEY

02:36:46.563 --> 02:36:47.898
HAVE TO I AGES. DON'T BELIEVE

02:36:47.965 --> 02:36:49.299
FAMILY MEMBERS SHOULD GET PAID

02:36:49.366 --> 02:36:52.202
FOR DOING I JUST A SERVICES AND

02:36:52.269 --> 02:36:53.704
THERE'S VERY LITTLE THAT WE CAN

02:36:53.771 --> 02:36:57.374
DO TO FORCE THEIR HAND IF THEY

02:36:57.441 --> 02:36:58.642
ARE THE MAJORITY ON THEIR

02:36:58.709 --> 02:37:01.578
COUNTY BOARDS AND SO IT PUSHES

02:37:01.645 --> 02:37:03.113
US TO COME TO THE STATE YEAR IN

02:37:03.180 --> 02:37:05.582
AND YEAR OUT AND CONTINUE TO

02:37:05.649 --> 02:37:06.784
HAVE THESE CONVERSATIONS I

02:37:06.850 --> 02:37:08.418
CAN'T COUNT TIMES I'VE BEEN ON

02:37:08.485 --> 02:37:10.521
THIS THIS I WISH THIS WAS NOT

02:37:10.587 --> 02:37:12.890
THE SITUATION BUT THIS IS WHERE

02:37:12.956 --> 02:37:15.359
WE ARE. WE TO MAKE IT CLEAR

02:37:15.425 --> 02:37:16.994
FROM THE STATE'S PERSPECTIVE

02:37:17.060 --> 02:37:17.895
THAT WHAT'S HAPPENING AT THE

02:37:17.961 --> 02:37:19.730
COUNTY LEVEL IS NOT ACCEPTABLE

02:37:19.797 --> 02:37:21.999
BECAUSE WHAT IS HAPPENING IS

02:37:22.065 --> 02:37:23.667
RESULTING IN A WORK FORCE

02:37:23.734 --> 02:37:26.570
CRISIS WHERE PEOPLE ARE NOT

02:37:26.637 --> 02:37:28.872
INCENTIVIZED TO DO THIS WORK

02:37:28.939 --> 02:37:31.275
BECAUSE THEY CAN GO TO THE IN

02:37:31.341 --> 02:37:31.842
N. OUT BURGER AND MAKE TWO

02:37:31.909 --> 02:37:33.343
DOLLARS MORE AN HOUR AND A

02:37:33.410 --> 02:37:35.913
HALF. BATHS NO ONE IS GOING TO

02:37:35.979 --> 02:37:37.548
TAKE ON THE JOB AND I JUST SAYS

02:37:37.614 --> 02:37:39.817
WORKER FOR MINIMUM WAGE UNLESS

02:37:39.883 --> 02:37:42.820
THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS AND THEY-

02:37:42.886 --> 02:37:44.054
DO SO OUT OF THE KINDNESS OF

02:37:44.121 --> 02:37:46.056
THEIR HEART. AND SO WHAT WE

02:37:46.123 --> 02:37:47.491
NEED TO DO IS INSURE WITH OUR

02:37:47.558 --> 02:37:48.792
AGING POPULATION THAT THERE'S

02:37:48.859 --> 02:37:50.661
ENOUGH FOLKS OUT THERE WILLING

02:37:50.727 --> 02:37:52.029
TO DO THIS WORK AND THE ONLY

02:37:52.095 --> 02:37:53.630
WAY YOU DO IT IS BY MAKING THE

02:37:53.697 --> 02:37:57.067
WAGES COMPETITIVE AT LEAST

02:37:57.134 --> 02:37:58.368
COMPETITIVE. WITH RETAIL

02:37:58.435 --> 02:38:00.604
ESTABLISHMENTS SO THIS IS

02:38:00.671 --> 02:38:01.939
REALLY ABOUT CREATING A

02:38:02.005 --> 02:38:03.974
SCENARIO WHERE WE DON'T HAVE TO

02:38:04.041 --> 02:38:06.076
HAVE YEARS OF DRAGGING THESE

02:38:06.143 --> 02:38:09.980
THINGS ON. AND TO CONCLUDE. THE

02:38:10.047 --> 02:38:11.281
REASON WE HAVE BEEN GETTING

02:38:11.348 --> 02:38:12.549
SUCCESS IN SOME OF THESE

02:38:12.616 --> 02:38:14.885
COUNTIES WE HAVE WRAPPED UP A

02:38:14.952 --> 02:38:16.787
NUMBER OVER THE LAST YEAR IS

02:38:16.854 --> 02:38:18.655
BECAUSE OF A NUMBER OF

02:38:18.722 --> 02:38:19.489
DIFFERENT THINGS THAT HAVE

02:38:19.556 --> 02:38:22.092
HAPPENED. POLITICAL PRESSURE.

02:38:22.159 --> 02:38:23.861
YOU KNOW I NEED NUMBER OF ITEMS

02:38:23.927 --> 02:38:25.829
THAT HAVE HAD TO TAKE PLACE AND

02:38:25.896 --> 02:38:27.698
FEAR THAT WE WILL ACTUALLY GET

02:38:27.764 --> 02:38:29.533
THIS NEW PENALTY WHICH IS

02:38:29.600 --> 02:38:30.400
MOTIVATING THEM TO GET THIS

GET TO THIS POINT THE AMOUNT OF

02:38:37.307 --> 02:38:38.308
ENERGY AND RESOURCES THAT ARE

02:38:38.375 --> 02:38:40.711
EXPENDED. WHEN THEY COULD JUST

02:38:40.777 --> 02:38:42.613
BE INVESTING INTO THE WORK THAT

02:38:42.679 --> 02:38:45.315
IS FOR THE MOST VULNERABLE IN

02:38:45.382 --> 02:38:47.851
SOCIETY WE CAN BY PASS ALL OF

03:34:10.037 --> 03:34:11.972
ANALYSIS AS TO THE TYPE OF

03:34:12.039 --> 03:34:13.740
INFORMATION THEY WOULD NEED AND

03:34:13.807 --> 03:34:14.975
CARRY FORWARD BUT THE IDEA

03:34:15.042 --> 03:34:16.710
WOULD BE THAT THE ACTUAL-

03:34:16.777 --> 03:34:18.011
TRANSITION WOULD SEEM BE

03:34:18.078 --> 03:34:19.446
SEAMLESS AND THE STATE OF

03:34:19.513 --> 03:34:20.914
PENNSYLVANIA WOULD ASSUME ALL

03:34:20.981 --> 03:34:22.849
UP FRONT COST. AND TO JUST MAKE

03:34:22.916 --> 03:34:24.818
SURE AGAIN IF THIS IS IT MOST

03:34:24.885 --> 03:34:26.954
OF THIS IS DONE ELECTRONICALLY

03:34:27.020 --> 03:34:28.222
SO IF ALL OF THAT IS FIGURED

03:34:28.288 --> 03:34:30.057
OUT THE IDEA WOULD BE THAT ONCE

03:34:30.123 --> 03:34:31.425
PENNSYLVANIA FOR EXAMPLE HOUSE

03:34:31.491 --> 03:34:32.359
ALL OF THE ACCOUNTS AND

03:34:32.426 --> 03:34:34.595
DEPOSITING INTO THAT. TO THE

03:34:34.661 --> 03:34:36.296
BANK ACCOUNTS NOTHING WOULD

03:34:36.363 --> 03:34:37.598
MOVE FORWARD UNTIL TESTS WERE

03:34:37.664 --> 03:34:39.967
RUN TO ENSURE THAT THE

03:34:40.033 --> 03:34:40.500
BENEFICIARIES WOULD NOT BE

03:34:40.567 --> 03:34:42.703
IMPACTED. I THINK MY QUESTION

03:34:42.769 --> 03:34:44.271
IS REGARDING WHETHER OR NOT

03:34:44.338 --> 03:34:45.872
THEY WOULD RECEIVE ONE CHECKER

03:34:45.939 --> 03:34:47.507
TOO. THEY WOULD RECEIVE TWO

03:34:47.574 --> 03:34:48.976
CHECKS THEY WOULD BASICALLY

03:34:49.042 --> 03:34:49.943
RECEIVE ONE FROM THE FEDERAL

03:34:50.010 --> 03:34:51.345
GOVERNMENT AND ONE. FROM

03:34:51.411 --> 03:34:53.780
CALIFORNIA. SO PERCEPTION FROM

03:34:53.847 --> 03:34:55.649
THE RECIPIENTS MAY BE THAT

03:34:55.716 --> 03:34:59.987
THERE- THAT THERE THAT IT WENT

03:35:00.053 --> 03:35:02.055
DOWN BUT THE REALITY BEING TWO

03:35:02.122 --> 03:35:04.858
CHECKS WOULD TOTAL THE SAME AS

03:35:04.925 --> 03:35:08.629
WAS BEFORE THAT IS CORRECT.

03:35:08.695 --> 03:35:09.730
BASED ON THIS DOES THE

03:35:09.796 --> 03:35:11.965
DEPARTMENT OR FINANCE HAVE ANY

03:35:12.032 --> 03:35:12.466
COMMENTS REGARDING THIS

03:35:12.532 --> 03:35:15.702
PROPOSAL. NOT AT THIS TIME I

TALKING TO FOLKS BUT WE DON'T

HAVE ANYTHING TO SUGGEST AT

03:35:20.941 --> 03:35:23.443
THIS TIME. YEAH GIVEN THAT

03:35:23.510 --> 03:35:25.912
IT'S- POTENTIAL STATE SAVINGS I

03:35:25.979 --> 03:35:28.115
MAY ASK. TO ENSURE THAT WE

03:35:28.181 --> 03:35:30.951
HAVE- AN APPROPRIATE ANALYSIS

03:35:31.018 --> 03:35:32.953
FROM. BOTH DEPARTMENT SO THAT

03:35:33.020 --> 03:35:35.188
WE CAN- AND SEE IF THIS IS A

03:35:35.255 --> 03:35:37.424
WAY WE COULD. HELP TO REINVEST

03:35:37.491 --> 03:35:39.159

YEAR TIME. THE COMPLEXITY OF

03:40:22.509 --> 03:40:24.511
