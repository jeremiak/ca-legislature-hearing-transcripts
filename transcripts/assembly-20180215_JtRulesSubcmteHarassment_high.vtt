00:17:36.555 --> 00:17:40.026 region:rollup2

00:17:38.558 --> 00:17:42.295 region:rollup2

ON THE BEHALF OF THE UNIVERSITY

SAN FRANCISCO SCHOOL OF LAW.

00:17:47.333 --> 00:17:50.736 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK ONE OF THE FIRST

00:17:48.768 --> 00:17:53.306 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT. THIS PANEL NEEDS TO

00:17:50.736 --> 00:17:55.875 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND IS THE UNIQUE ASPECTS

00:17:53.306 --> 00:17:57.243 region:rollup2
OF THIS WORKPLACE.

00:17:55.875 --> 00:18:00.012 region:rollup2
SO EACH OF YOU EACH OF THE

00:17:57.243 --> 00:18:02.481 region:rollup2
MEMBERS HAS THE ULTIMATE.

00:18:00.012 --> 00:18:06.786 region:rollup2
HIRING AND FIRING AUTHORITY.

00:18:02.481 --> 00:18:09.522 region:rollup2
IF SOMEONE IS IN YOUR WORKPLACE.

00:18:06.786 --> 00:18:10.323 region:rollup2
WHO IS EXPERIENCING SAM OF

00:18:09.522 --> 00:18:11.891 region:rollup2
SEXUAL HARASSMENT OR SEX

00:18:10.323 --> 00:18:13.426 region:rollup2
DISCRIMINATION?

00:18:11.891 --> 00:18:15.861 region:rollup2
OR IF THEY'RE BYSTANDER TO

00:18:13.426 --> 00:18:18.331 region:rollup2
WITNESS TO SUCH ACTIONS.

00:18:15.861 --> 00:18:18.531 region:rollup2
AND THEY WISH TO COMPLAIN ABOUT

00:18:18.331 --> 00:18:20.967 region:rollup2
THIS.

00:18:18.531 --> 00:18:23.002 region:rollup2
OR TRANSFER TO ANOTHER

00:18:20.967 --> 00:18:24.637 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT

00:18:23.002 --> 00:18:27.006 region:rollup2
OR TRANSFERRED TO ANOTHER.

00:18:24.637 --> 00:18:28.040 region:rollup2
POSITION THAT'S EXCEEDINGLY HARD

00:18:27.006 --> 00:18:29.275 region:rollup2
IN THIS WORKPLACE IT'S UNIQUE

00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:31.077 region:rollup2
FACTOR.

00:18:29.275 --> 00:18:33.045 region:rollup2
OF THE CAPITAL.

00:18:31.077 --> 00:18:36.048 region:rollup2
SO FOR EXAMPLE IF YOUR WOMAN

00:18:33.045 --> 00:18:37.216 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCING SEXUAL HARASSMENT.

00:18:36.048 --> 00:18:39.385 region:rollup2
BY A MEMBER.

00:18:37.216 --> 00:18:41.854 region:rollup2
WHERE YOU GO YOU CAN EASILY

00:18:39.385 --> 00:18:43.322 region:rollup2
TRANSFER? ADDITIONALLY IF YOU'RE

00:18:41.854 --> 00:18:44.857 region:rollup2
STAFFERS SEEING INAPPROPRIATE

00:18:43.322 --> 00:18:46.192 region:rollup2
CONDUCT IN THE WORKPLACE

00:18:44.857 --> 00:18:46.659 region:rollup2
COMMENTS THAT PERHAPS SHOULD BE

00:18:46.192 --> 00:18:48.194 region:rollup2
MADE.

00:18:46.659 --> 00:18:49.996 region:rollup2
I.

00:18:48.194 --> 00:18:52.965 region:rollup2
THAT SORT OF CONDUCT.

00:18:49.996 --> 00:18:54.433 region:rollup2
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO COME OUT.

00:18:52.965 --> 00:18:56.769 region:rollup2
AND SAY THIS IS CONDUCT THAT

00:18:54.433 --> 00:18:59.405 region:rollup2
SHOULD NOT BE HAPPENING BECAUSE

00:18:56.769 --> 00:19:01.240 region:rollup2
OF THE LACK OF EASY. A MOBILITY

00:18:59.405 --> 00:19:03.242 region:rollup2
IN THE CAPITAL.

00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:05.578 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THE UNIQUE FACTORS OF

00:19:03.242 --> 00:19:06.078 region:rollup2
THIS WORKPLACE. INCLUDING THE

00:19:05.578 --> 00:19:08.881 region:rollup2
DIFFICULTY TO DISCIPLINE

00:19:06.078 --> 00:19:09.982 region:rollup2
MEMBERS.

00:19:08.881 --> 00:19:11.684 region:rollup2
WHO HAVE ENGAGED IN SEXUAL

00:19:09.982 --> 00:19:13.853 region:rollup2
HARASSMENT DISCRIMINATION

00:19:11.684 --> 00:19:15.154 region:rollup2
RETALIATION THAT REALLY HAS TO

00:19:13.853 --> 00:19:17.056 region:rollup2
BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT AT THIS

00:19:15.154 --> 00:19:19.392 region:rollup2
UNIQUE WORKPLACE?

00:19:17.056 --> 00:19:22.028 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THAT I THINK YOU NEED

00:19:19.392 --> 00:19:24.030 region:rollup2
EVEN MORE STRINGENT POLICIES

00:19:22.028 --> 00:19:24.497 region:rollup2
PROCEDURES. AND THIS REALLY NEED

00:19:24.030 --> 00:19:27.133 region:rollup2
TO BE A ZERO TOLERANCE

00:19:24.497 --> 00:19:28.868 region:rollup2
WORKPLACE.

00:19:27.133 --> 00:19:30.770 region:rollup2
AND THE REASON FOR THAT IN LARGE

00:19:28.868 --> 00:19:32.271 region:rollup2
PART IS BECAUSE OTHERWISE PEOPLE

00:19:30.770 --> 00:19:33.339 region:rollup2
ARE NOT GOING TO GO FORWARD.

00:19:32.271 --> 00:19:35.274 region:rollup2
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE YEARS OF

00:19:33.339 --> 00:19:37.476 region:rollup2
ENTRENCHED BEHAVIOR THAT DOESN'T

00:19:35.274 --> 00:19:39.011 region:rollup2
COME TO THE FORE. UNTIL YOU END

00:19:37.476 --> 00:19:42.248 region:rollup2
UP WITH MULTIPLE COMPLAINTS OF

00:19:39.011 --> 00:19:43.949 region:rollup2
EGREGIOUS CONDUCT.

00:19:42.248 --> 00:19:44.583 region:rollup2
SO THE FIRST THING I THINK THAT

00:19:43.949 --> 00:19:46.252 region:rollup2
THIS.

00:19:44.583 --> 00:19:47.887 region:rollup2
PANEL NEEDS TO THINK ABOUT IS

00:19:46.252 --> 00:19:49.255 region:rollup2
THE UNIQUE FEATURES OF THIS

00:19:47.887 --> 00:19:51.557 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR WORKPLACE WHICH IS

00:19:49.255 --> 00:19:53.125 region:rollup2
UNLIKE OTHER STATE EMPLOYERS

00:19:51.557 --> 00:19:54.627 region:rollup2
WHERE YOU MIGHT HAVE THE

00:19:53.125 --> 00:19:56.429 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY TO TRANSFER.

00:19:54.627 --> 00:19:58.297 region:rollup2
IF YOU'RE EXPERIENCING SEXUAL

00:19:56.429 --> 00:20:01.300 region:rollup2
HARASSMENT OR RETALIATION IN THE

00:19:58.297 --> 00:20:02.001 region:rollup2
WORKPLACE OR RIDE A RETURN TO

00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:04.270 region:rollup2
OTHER.

00:20:02.001 --> 00:20:06.605 region:rollup2
TATE EMPLOYMENT THAT'S WHY

00:20:04.270 --> 00:20:08.774 region:rollup2
THIS HAS TO BE MORE STRINGENT

00:20:06.605 --> 00:20:10.643 region:rollup2
AND THE INVESTIGATION POLICIES

00:20:08.774 --> 00:20:14.013 region:rollup2
PROCEDURES HAVE TO BE FOLLOWED

00:20:10.643 --> 00:20:15.147 region:rollup2
TO THE LETTER.

00:20:14.013 --> 00:20:16.482 region:rollup2
THIS ALSO HIGHLIGHTS THE

00:20:15.147 --> 00:20:18.684 region:rollup2
DIFFERENTIAL IN POWER WHICH

00:20:16.482 --> 00:20:19.318 region:rollup2
ALREADY EXISTS

00:20:18.684 --> 00:20:22.421 region:rollup2
SO MEMBERS.

00:20:19.318 --> 00:20:24.090 region:rollup2
IT AS ELECTED OFFICIALS HAVE.

00:20:22.421 --> 00:20:25.624 region:rollup2
A GREAT DEAL OF POWER THAT'S

00:20:24.090 --> 00:20:27.626 region:rollup2
ENTRENCHED IN THEIR POSITIONAL

00:20:25.624 --> 00:20:29.161 region:rollup2
READY. GIVEN THE UNIQUE FACTORS

00:20:27.626 --> 00:20:31.630 region:rollup2
OF THIS WORKPLACE THAT POWER

00:20:29.161 --> 00:20:34.233 region:rollup2
DIFFERENTIAL IS ONLY INCREASE.

00:20:31.630 --> 00:20:36.635 region:rollup2
.

00:20:34.233 --> 00:20:37.736 region:rollup2
PART OF WHAT'S REQUIRED BY AN

00:20:36.635 --> 00:20:40.072 region:rollup2
EMPLOYER WHETHER YOU LOOK AT THE

00:20:37.736 --> 00:20:42.408 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE SOME OTHER EMPLOYER.

00:20:40.072 --> 00:20:44.243 region:rollup2
IS A PAST FAILURE TO INVESTIGATE

00:20:42.408 --> 00:20:45.544 region:rollup2
IN REMEDY. ALLEGATIONS OF

00:20:44.243 --> 00:20:47.246 region:rollup2
HARASSMENT IS LIKELY TO

00:20:45.544 --> 00:20:49.281 region:rollup2
CONTRIBUTED ADDITIONAL

00:20:47.246 --> 00:20:51.217 region:rollup2
HARASSMENT IN THE WORKPLACE AND

00:20:49.281 --> 00:20:52.384 region:rollup2
TO ENCOURAGE RETALIATION AGAINST

00:20:51.217 --> 00:20:53.853 region:rollup2
THOSE WHO COMPLAIN.

00:20:52.384 --> 00:20:56.789 region:rollup2
THAT WAS ACTUALLY THE HAWKINS

00:20:53.853 --> 00:20:58.624 region:rollup2
VERSES HENNEPIN TECH CENTER CASE

00:20:56.789 --> 00:21:00.092 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK IT REALLY SAYS WHAT

00:20:58.624 --> 00:21:01.994 region:rollup2
WE ALL KNOW IS IF YOU ALLOW

00:21:00.092 --> 00:21:03.295 region:rollup2
HARASSMENT TO FLOURISH.

00:21:01.994 --> 00:21:04.463 region:rollup2
IT ENCOURAGES ADDITIONAL

00:21:03.295 --> 00:21:06.665 region:rollup2
HARASSMENT AND IT ALSO

00:21:04.463 --> 00:21:08.601 region:rollup2
ENCOURAGES RETALIATION FOR THOSE

00:21:06.665 --> 00:21:10.136 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS WHO DO COME FOR OUR

00:21:08.601 --> 00:21:12.772 region:rollup2
ATTENDED KATE THAT THERE'S.

00:21:10.136 --> 00:21:14.406 region:rollup2
INAPPROPRIATE OR UNLAWFUL.

00:21:12.772 --> 00:21:15.975 region:rollup2
CONDUCT IN THE WORKPLACE

00:21:14.406 --> 00:21:18.010 region:rollup2
SOWHAT DO WE DO I'D LIKE TO A

00:21:15.975 --> 00:21:20.246 region:rollup2
TOP TALK ABOUT A COUPLE OF VERY

00:21:18.010 --> 00:21:23.382 region:rollup2
SPECIFIC TANGIBLE WAYS TO

00:21:20.246 --> 00:21:25.551 region:rollup2
ADDRESS THIS.

00:21:23.382 --> 00:21:27.186 region:rollup2
ONE IS OF THE STATUE OF

00:21:25.551 --> 00:21:29.688 region:rollup2
LIMITATIONS BECAUSE OF THE

00:21:27.186 --> 00:21:31.390 region:rollup2
UNIQUE FEATUREOF THIS WORKPLACE

00:21:29.688 --> 00:21:35.027 region:rollup2
WHERE IT'S VERY DIFFICULT.

00:21:31.390 --> 00:21:37.229 region:rollup2
UP TO FRANKLY COMPLAIN AND ALSO

00:21:35.027 --> 00:21:38.364 region:rollup2
TO TRANSFER. THE STATUE OF

00:21:37.229 --> 00:21:40.399 region:rollup2
LIMITATIONS OF ONE YEARS

00:21:38.364 --> 00:21:41.700 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY EGREGIOUS.

00:21:40.399 --> 00:21:44.170 region:rollup2

I HAVE TALKED ABOUT AND THERE IS

00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:52.545 region:rollup2
BEFORE THIS BODY. US IT

00:21:50.876 --> 00:21:54.246 region:rollup2
LEGISLATION WHICH WOULD INCREASE

00:21:52.545 --> 00:21:55.681 region:rollup2
THAT STATUE OF LIMITATIONS TO

00:21:54.246 --> 00:21:57.683 region:rollup2

00:21:55.681 --> 00:21:59.718 region:rollup2
HELPS ADDRESS SOME OF THE ISSUES

00:21:57.683 --> 00:22:00.486 region:rollup2
OF THE DIFFICULTY OF COMING

00:21:59.718 --> 00:22:01.453 region:rollup2
FORWARD IN THE POWER

00:22:00.486 --> 00:22:03.189 region:rollup2
DIFFERENTIAL. I THINK THAT'S

00:22:01.453 --> 00:22:05.057 region:rollup2
CRITICAL.

00:22:03.189 --> 00:22:06.492 region:rollup2
THERE HAVE BEEN REPORTS.

00:22:05.057 --> 00:22:08.861 region:rollup2

00:22:11.697 --> 00:22:13.832 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY BECAUSE I

00:22:13.399 --> 00:22:14.333 region:rollup2
THINK THAT WOULD BE

00:22:13.832 --> 00:22:16.001 region:rollup2
INAPPROPRIATE.

00:22:14.333 --> 00:22:17.536 region:rollup2
HOWEVER

00:22:16.001 --> 00:22:19.572 region:rollup2
THERE HAD BEEN APPROACH OF

00:22:17.536 --> 00:22:21.173 region:rollup2
REPORTS IN THE MEDIA REGARDING

00:22:19.572 --> 00:22:22.741 region:rollup2
NO REHIRE CLAUSES

00:22:21.173 --> 00:22:24.210 region:rollup2
WELL IF YOU HAVE A NO REHIRE

IN THE WORKPLACE.

WHERE DO YOU GO NOT ONLY DO NOT

00:22:29.281 --> 00:22:32.351 region:rollup2
HAVE AN ABILITY TO IT TO

00:22:32.351 --> 00:22:34.820 region:rollup2
LOCKED OUT OF AN ENTIRE CAREER

00:22:33.485 --> 00:22:36.589 region:rollup2
PATH?

00:22:34.820 --> 00:22:37.890 region:rollup2
HE'S NO REHIRE CLAUSES SHOULD BE

00:22:36.589 --> 00:22:40.492 region:rollup2
ILLEGAL AS A MATTER PUBLIC

00:22:37.890 --> 00:22:40.993 region:rollup2

TYPE OF WORK PLACE WHERE

00:22:40.993 --> 00:22:42.895 region:rollup2
THERE'S.

00:22:42.428 --> 00:22:44.530 region:rollup2
THESE AGREE JUST POWER

00:22:42.895 --> 00:22:46.999 region:rollup2
DIFFERENTIALS AND A LACK OF

00:22:44.530 --> 00:22:48.467 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY.

00:22:46.999 --> 00:22:50.936 region:rollup2
CONFIDENTIALITY CLAUSES

00:22:48.467 --> 00:22:51.770 region:rollup2
CONFIDENTIALITY CLAUSES IN THIS

WORKPLACE ARE PARTICULARLY

00:22:51.770 --> 00:22:55.507 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT AND I THINK OUR

00:22:53.739 --> 00:22:57.276 region:rollup2
AGAINST PUBLIC POLICY THE REASON

00:22:55.507 --> 00:22:59.478 region:rollup2
FOR THAT IS. IF YOU HAVE A

00:22:57.276 --> 00:23:01.146 region:rollup2
CONFIDENTIALITY CLAUSE

00:22:59.478 --> 00:23:02.781 region:rollup2

HAPPENING IN THAT MEMBERS OFFICE

00:23:02.781 --> 00:23:06.018 region:rollup2
IT'S HARD ENOUGH TO COME FORWARD

00:23:04.550 --> 00:23:07.887 region:rollup2
IT'S HARD ENOUGH IF YOU'RE BY

00:23:06.018 --> 00:23:09.388 region:rollup2
STANDARD TO SAY. OF WHEN YOU SEE

CONFIDENTIALITY CLAUSES ARE

00:23:26.405 --> 00:23:29.174 region:rollup2

THEM CAME OUT AND SAID

00:23:54.300 --> 00:23:57.336 region:rollup2
PARTICULARLY AS IT RELATES TO

00:23:59.171 --> 00:24:02.975 region:rollup2
ARE AGAINST PUBLIC POLICY THERE

00:24:01.006 --> 00:24:05.077 region:rollup2
AGAINST TRANSPARENCY AND THEY

00:24:02.975 --> 00:24:07.780 region:rollup2
ALLOW REPEAT PLAYERS ARE REPEAT

00:24:05.077 --> 00:24:09.915 region:rollup2
HARASSERS TO EXIST AND TO

00:24:07.780 --> 00:24:11.817 region:rollup2
CONTINUE WITH. THIS UNLAWFUL

00:24:09.915 --> 00:24:14.053 region:rollup2
CONDUCT I HAVE PROVIDED THAT

00:24:11.817 --> 00:24:16.221 region:rollup2

NATION.

00:24:20.225 --> 00:24:23.128 region:rollup2
THE POLICIES THEMSELVES

00:24:21.961 --> 00:24:24.897 region:rollup2
OTHER GOVERNMENTS BODY HAVE TO

00:24:23.128 --> 00:24:26.532 region:rollup2
BE LOOKED AT.

00:24:24.897 --> 00:24:28.300 region:rollup2
I AM ONE OF THE ISSUES WHICH I

00:24:26.532 --> 00:24:29.468 region:rollup2
THINK IS A WONDERFUL STEP IN THE

00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:31.003 region:rollup2
RIGHT DIRECTION BUT I THINK

00:24:29.468 --> 00:24:34.173 region:rollup2
FALLS SHORT.

00:24:31.003 --> 00:24:35.874 region:rollup2
IS THE ABILITY OF VICTIMS TO GO

00:24:34.173 --> 00:24:37.543 region:rollup2
STRAIGHT TO WE.

00:24:35.874 --> 00:24:39.378 region:rollup2
NOW IT'S WONDERFUL THAT THERE IS

00:24:37.543 --> 00:24:40.713 region:rollup2
A A PLACE THAT INDIVIDUALS CAN

00:24:39.378 --> 00:24:41.280 region:rollup2
GO AND TO DISCUSS THEIR

00:24:40.713 --> 00:24:43.615 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCES AND PERHAPS GET

00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:46.518 region:rollup2
HELP.

00:24:43.615 --> 00:24:48.153 region:rollup2
PROBLEM LIES IS THAT IT'S NOT

00:24:46.518 --> 00:24:50.289 region:rollup2
CONSIDERED PROTECTED ACTIVITY SO

00:24:48.153 --> 00:24:51.590 region:rollup2
IF THIS BODY SAYS TO A PERSON

00:24:50.289 --> 00:24:52.591 region:rollup2
WHO'S A VICTIM OF HARASSMENT OR

00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:54.393 region:rollup2
RETALIATION.

00:24:52.591 --> 00:24:56.562 region:rollup2
GO TO WE'VE.

00:24:54.393 --> 00:24:58.263 region:rollup2
BUT DON'T TELL THEM THIS IS NOT

00:24:56.562 --> 00:25:00.866 region:rollup2
CONSIDERED A PROTECTED ACTIVITY

00:24:58.263 --> 00:25:02.334 region:rollup2
AND THE US YOU ARE NOT COVERED

00:25:00.866 --> 00:25:03.802 region:rollup2
BY THE WHISTLEBLOWER LAWS IF YOU

00:25:02.334 --> 00:25:05.504 region:rollup2
DO THAT. I THINK THAT'S A MAJOR

00:25:03.802 --> 00:25:08.140 region:rollup2
PROBLEM.

00:25:05.504 --> 00:25:09.842 region:rollup2
EITHER WE NEED TO SAY AS A

00:25:08.140 --> 00:25:10.476 region:rollup2
MATTER OF PUBLIC POLICY IF

00:25:09.842 --> 00:25:12.177 region:rollup2
YOU'RE TELLING PEOPLE TO GO TO

00:25:10.476 --> 00:25:14.079 region:rollup2
WE'VE THAT IS CONSIDERED A

00:25:12.177 --> 00:25:16.548 region:rollup2
PROTECTE ACTIVITY AND YOU'LL BE

00:25:14.079 --> 00:25:18.751 region:rollup2
COVERED BY A WHISTLEBLOWER LAWS.

00:25:16.548 --> 00:25:20.652 region:rollup2
AND OR YOU NEED TO TELL THOSE

00:25:18.751 --> 00:25:21.854 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS WHO COME FORWARD

00:25:20.652 --> 00:25:23.822 region:rollup2
WITH HARASSMENT DISCRIMINATION

00:25:21.854 --> 00:25:25.024 region:rollup2
AND RETALIATION CLAIMS. IF YOU

00:25:23.822 --> 00:25:26.692 region:rollup2
CHOOSE TO GO TO WE'VE THAT IS

00:25:25.024 --> 00:25:29.795 region:rollup2
NOT.

00:25:26.692 --> 00:25:31.630 region:rollup2
A PROTECTED US ACTIVITY AND YOU

00:25:29.795 --> 00:25:34.366 region:rollup2
WILL NOT BE COVERED BY THE LAW

00:25:31.630 --> 00:25:35.701 region:rollup2
THE INDIVIDUAL WHO IS A VICTIM

00:25:34.366 --> 00:25:36.935 region:rollup2
OR SURVIVOR OF HARASSMENT

00:25:35.701 --> 00:25:38.270 region:rollup2
DISCRIMINATION RETALIATION

00:25:36.935 --> 00:25:39.905 region:rollup2
SHOULD AT LEAST KNOW WHERE THEY

00:25:38.270 --> 00:25:42.441 region:rollup2
STAND. IF THEY'RE TOLD UNDER THE

00:25:39.905 --> 00:25:43.409 region:rollup2
POLICIES TO REPORT SOMEPLACE AND

00:25:42.441 --> 00:25:45.177 region:rollup2
WHERE THE REPORTING IS NOT

00:25:43.409 --> 00:25:46.812 region:rollup2
CONSIDERED A PROTECTED ACTIVITY

00:25:45.177 --> 00:25:48.213 region:rollup2
UNDER THE LAW. THAT'S A MAJOR

00:25:46.812 --> 00:25:51.316 region:rollup2
PROBLEM.

00:25:48.213 --> 00:25:53.152 region:rollup2
REGARDING INVESTIGATION.

00:25:51.316 --> 00:25:54.119 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK IT'S WONDERFUL THAT

00:25:53.152 --> 00:25:55.454 region:rollup2
THEIR INVESTIGATIONS THAT ARE

00:25:54.119 --> 00:25:57.990 region:rollup2
STARTING I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT

00:25:55.454 --> 00:26:00.125 region:rollup2
FOR TRANSPARENCY HOWEVER. WHEN

00:25:57.990 --> 00:26:01.627 region:rollup2
WE LOOK AT THE INVESTIGATIONS WE

00:26:00.125 --> 00:26:03.128 region:rollup2
NEED TO DETERMINE BOMB.

00:26:01.627 --> 00:26:03.295 region:rollup2
CERTAIN GUIDELINES

00:26:03.128 --> 00:26:04.930 region:rollup2
AND.

00:26:03.295 --> 00:26:06.298 region:rollup2
.

00:26:04.930 --> 00:26:08.200 region:rollup2
TRANSPARENCY REGARDING THOSE

00:26:06.298 --> 00:26:09.435 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATIONS

00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:10.903 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT I

00:26:09.435 --> 00:26:12.371 region:rollup2
THINK NEED TO BE ANSWERED AS IT

00:26:10.903 --> 00:26:14.406 region:rollup2
RELATES TO THOSE INVESTIGATIONS

00:26:12.371 --> 00:26:16.141 region:rollup2
ARE WHAT ARE THE RULES OF THE

00:26:14.406 --> 00:26:16.942 region:rollup2
PERSONS IN THE INVESTIGATION.

00:26:16.141 --> 00:26:18.544 region:rollup2
WATER THEIR QUALIFICATIONS AND

00:26:16.942 --> 00:26:20.879 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE

00:26:18.544 --> 00:26:22.481 region:rollup2
DO THEY HAVE ANY CONFLICT OF

00:26:20.879 --> 00:26:24.149 region:rollup2

00:26:25.884 --> 00:26:29.221 region:rollup2
THE LIKELIHOOD IS NONE OF THOSE

00:26:27.686 --> 00:26:31.356 region:rollup2
THINGS ARE TRUE BUT THE PEOPLE

PARTICIPATING IN INVESTIGATIONS

00:26:31.356 --> 00:26:34.726 region:rollup2
NEED TO KNOW THAT UP FRONT

00:26:33.125 --> 00:26:36.295 region:rollup2
RATHER THAN AS THEY WAIT INTO

00:27:20.239 --> 00:27:24.176 region:rollup2
FRONT END AND THEY HAVE TO BE.

00:27:22.641 --> 00:27:25.911 region:rollup2
AFFIRMATIVELY COMMUNICATED.

00:27:24.176 --> 00:27:27.779 region:rollup2
ARE THERE ANY POLICIES IN PLACE

00:27:25.911 --> 00:27:29.248 region:rollup2
REGARDING. ANY CONFLICTS OF

00:27:27.779 --> 00:27:30.916 region:rollup2
INTEREST WHICH MAY MANIFEST IN

00:27:29.248 --> 00:27:32.885 region:rollup2
THE FUTURE DOES NEED TO BE

00:27:30.916 --> 00:27:34.653 region:rollup2
CONTEMPLATED UP FRONT.

00:27:32.885 --> 00:27:35.854 region:rollup2
ADDITIONALLY IS THERE ANY WAIVER

00:27:34.653 --> 00:27:37.122 region:rollup2
OF ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE AND

00:27:35.854 --> 00:27:38.657 region:rollup2
WORK PRODUCT WITH THE

00:27:37.122 --> 00:27:39.992 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATIVE REPORT.

00:27:38.657 --> 00:27:41.627 region:rollup2
IF YOU COVER INVESTIGATIVE

00:27:39.992 --> 00:27:42.861 region:rollup2
REPORTS IF YOU HAVE ATTORNEYS DO

00:27:41.627 --> 00:27:44.062 region:rollup2
THOSE AND THEN DECIDE THAT

00:27:42.861 --> 00:27:46.064 region:rollup2
COVERED BY ATTORNEY CLIENT

00:27:44.062 --> 00:27:48.066 region:rollup2
PRIVILEGE AND WORK PRODUCT.

00:27:46.064 --> 00:27:50.402 region:rollup2
THAT'S VERY PROBLEMATIC I THINK

00:27:48.066 --> 00:27:52.571 region:rollup2
FOR THE ASSEMBLY M. AND FOR THE

00:27:50.402 --> 00:27:53.872 region:rollup2
SENATE BECAUSE IT MEANS THAT

00:27:52.571 --> 00:27:55.974 region:rollup2
THERE IS A LACK OF TRANSPARENCY.

00:27:53.872 --> 00:27:57.176 region:rollup2
WE'RE ALSO ASKING EMPLOYEES TO

00:27:55.974 --> 00:27:59.311 region:rollup2
COME FORWARD WHERE THEY HAVE

00:27:57.176 --> 00:28:00.812 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT FEAR OF RETALIATION

00:27:59.311 --> 00:28:02.881 region:rollup2
BUT NEVER PROVIDING THEM WITH

00:28:00.812 --> 00:28:04.783 region:rollup2
ANY DATA OF WHAT HAPPENS.

00:28:02.881 --> 00:28:06.151 region:rollup2
I'M. ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS WHICH

00:28:04.783 --> 00:28:07.853 region:rollup2
NEED TO BE ANSWERED IS WHO GETS

00:28:06.151 --> 00:28:09.254 region:rollup2
THE REPORTS AND WHAT HAPPENS TO

00:28:07.853 --> 00:28:11.256 region:rollup2
THEM WHERE DOES THAT DATA GO

00:28:09.254 --> 00:28:13.225 region:rollup2
WHERE'S IT DISTRIBUTED. IF YOUR

00:28:11.256 --> 00:28:14.259 region:rollup2
WITNESS AFRAID ABOUT RETALIATION

00:28:13.225 --> 00:28:15.494 region:rollup2
IN THE WORKPLACE AND YOU DON'T

00:28:14.259 --> 00:28:16.862 region:rollup2
KNOW WHERE YOUR DATA IS GOING

00:28:15.494 --> 00:28:18.297 region:rollup2
WHO'S GOING TO BE READING IT HOW

00:28:16.862 --> 00:28:19.798 region:rollup2
IT'S GOING TO BE DISTRIBUTED.

00:28:18.297 --> 00:28:21.300 region:rollup2
YOU'RE UNLIKELY TO COME FORWARD

00:28:19.798 --> 00:28:21.833 region:rollup2
AND SHARE ALL OF THE INFORMATION

00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:24.036 region:rollup2
THAT YOU HAVE AN OPEN AND

00:28:21.833 --> 00:28:25.537 region:rollup2
STE WAY.

00:28:24.036 --> 00:28:25.938 region:rollup2
ADDITIONALLY WHAT'S THE SCOPE IN

00:28:25.537 --> 00:28:28.140 region:rollup2
THE MANDATE OF THE

00:28:25.938 --> 00:28:30.242 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATION.

00:28:28.140 --> 00:28:31.743 region:rollup2
IF THERE ARE OTHER IDENTIFIED

00:28:30.242 --> 00:28:33.912 region:rollup2
PROBLEMS IN THE WORKPLACE LET'S

00:28:31.743 --> 00:28:35.380 region:rollup2
SAY ONE PERSON COMES FORWARD

00:28:33.912 --> 00:28:35.981 region:rollup2
WITH AS A REPORT OF

00:28:35.380 --> 00:28:37.683 region:rollup2
INAPPROPRIATE CONDUCT IN THE

00:28:35.981 --> 00:28:39.184 region:rollup2
WORKPLACE.

00:28:37.683 --> 00:28:40.786 region:rollup2
THE INVESTIGATOR GOES AND TALKS

00:28:39.184 --> 00:28:42.521 region:rollup2
TO OTHER WITNESSES AND FINDS OUT

00:28:40.786 --> 00:28:43.889 region:rollup2
LOAN BEHOLD THIS IS A PATTERN OR

00:28:42.521 --> 00:28:44.890 region:rollup2
PRACTICE IN THE WORKPLACE THERE

00:28:43.889 --> 00:28:46.792 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN OTHER PEOPLE HAVE BEEN

00:28:44.890 --> 00:28:47.960 region:rollup2
TOUCHED INAPPROPRIATELY. OTHER

00:28:46.792 --> 00:28:49.561 region:rollup2
COMMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN A

00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:50.996 region:rollup2
INAPPROPRIATE IN THE WORKPLACE.

00:28:49.561 --> 00:28:52.564 region:rollup2
IS THE INVESTIGATOR ALLOWED TO

00:28:50.996 --> 00:28:54.800 region:rollup2
LOOK AT THOSE ISSUES

00:28:52.564 --> 00:28:55.634 region:rollup2
I WOULD POSIT THAT YES IF YOU

00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:57.736 region:rollup2
ARE OPENING UP THAT

00:28:55.634 --> 00:28:59.504 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATION YOU SHOULD ALLOW

00:28:57.736 --> 00:29:01.240 region:rollup2
THE SCOPE OF THE INVESTIGATION

00:28:59.504 --> 00:29:02.241 region:rollup2
DOING ENCOMPASS THOSE ISSUES.

00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:04.042 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT IS YOUR LEGAL DUTY TO

00:29:02.241 --> 00:29:06.078 region:rollup2
ADDRESS.

00:29:04.042 --> 00:29:08.947 region:rollup2
ALL ISSUES OF HARASSMENT IN THE

00:29:06.078 --> 00:29:09.982 region:rollup2
WORKPLACE AND TO UTILIZE ALL

00:29:08.947 --> 00:29:11.316 region:rollup2
REMEDIAL MEASURES WHICH UNDER

00:29:09.982 --> 00:29:12.851 region:rollup2
THE LAW IT IS AN EFFECTIVE

00:29:11.316 --> 00:29:15.420 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATION. OF AN

00:29:12.851 --> 00:29:18.657 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATION INVESTIGATOR IS

00:29:15.420 --> 00:29:19.057 region:rollup2
PRESENTED WITH UNLAWFUL CONDUCT

00:29:18.657 --> 00:29:20.392 region:rollup2
IN THE WORKPLACE.

00:29:19.057 --> 00:29:22.060 region:rollup2
THIS BODY SHOULD ALLOW THE

00:29:20.392 --> 00:29:23.362 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATION TO LOOK AT THAT AS

00:29:22.060 --> 00:29:24.463 region:rollup2
OPPOSED TO PRETENDING THAT

00:29:23.362 --> 00:29:26.431 region:rollup2
THERE'S BLINDERS AND IT NEVER

00:29:24.463 --> 00:29:28.533 region:rollup2
HAPPENED THAT DEEP SIX IS THE

00:29:26.431 --> 00:29:32.537 region:rollup2
INFORMATION AND ENCOURAGES

00:29:28.533 --> 00:29:33.639 region:rollup2
UNLAWFUL CONDUCT FLOURISH.

00:29:32.537 --> 00:29:35.240 region:rollup2
WHAT ABOUT ACCESS TO PRIOR AND

00:29:33.639 --> 00:29:37.542 region:rollup2
SUBSEQUENT COMPLAINTS WHEN

00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:39.611 region:rollup2
THERE'S ONE COMPLAINT? IT BIG

00:29:37.542 --> 00:29:40.979 region:rollup2
COULD BE EVEN A MINOR COMPLAINT

00:29:39.611 --> 00:29:42.648 region:rollup2
LET'S SAY ONE CAN BE CALLED A

00:29:40.979 --> 00:29:44.816 region:rollup2
MINOR COMPLAINT BUT IF THERE

00:29:42.648 --> 00:29:46.284 region:rollup2
SPEND THREE OR FOUR COMPLAINTS

00:29:44.816 --> 00:29:48.754 region:rollup2
AGAINST THE SAME MEMBER THE SAME

00:29:46.284 --> 00:29:50.222 region:rollup2
STAFFER. IT BEGINS TO LOOK LIKE

00:29:48.754 --> 00:29:52.424 region:rollup2
A PATTERN AND PRACTICE PROBLEMS.

00:29:50.222 --> 00:29:54.092 region:rollup2
AND SO THE ISSUE OF WHETHER

00:29:52.424 --> 00:29:56.094 region:rollup2
THERE'S PRIOR COMPLAINTS OR

00:29:54.092 --> 00:29:58.296 region:rollup2
SUBSEQUENT COMPLAINTS IS

00:29:56.094 --> 00:29:59.965 region:rollup2
EXTREMELY RELEVANT IN ORDER TO

00:29:58.296 --> 00:30:01.266 region:rollup2
GET A PICTURE OF WHAT'S ACTUALLY

00:29:59.965 --> 00:30:03.201 region:rollup2
HAPPENING HERE.

00:30:01.266 --> 00:30:04.903 region:rollup2
THE CONVERSE IS TRUE IF THERE

00:30:03.201 --> 00:30:07.406 region:rollup2
WEREN'T ANY OTHER PER COMPLAINTS

00:30:04.903 --> 00:30:08.807 region:rollup2
AND THE MEMBER HAS DEEMED TO BE.

00:30:07.406 --> 00:30:10.809 region:rollup2
AYE ACTING APPROPRIATELY IN

00:30:08.807 --> 00:30:13.045 region:rollup2
EVERY OTHER WAY AND IF THE

00:30:10.809 --> 00:30:14.846 region:rollup2
COMPLAINT IS OF WHAT COULD BE

00:30:13.045 --> 00:30:16.181 region:rollup2
CONSIDERED A STRAIGHT  <u><c.green>UP A</c></u>

00:30:14.846 --> 00:30:18.150 region:rollup2
MINOR ISSUE.

00:30:16.181 --> 00:30:19.718 region:rollup2
THAT ALSO SHOULD BE TAKEN INTO

00:30:18.150 --> 00:30:20.819 region:rollup2
ACCOUNT BUT WE CAN'T EVALUATE

00:30:19.718 --> 00:30:22.587 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:30:20.819 --> 00:30:24.122 region:rollup2
UNLESS YOU NO ARE THERE PRIOR

00:30:22.587 --> 00:30:25.424 region:rollup2
COMPLAINTS BY THEIR SUBSEQUENT

00:30:24.122 --> 00:30:27.159 region:rollup2
COMPLAINTS AND WHAT WERE THE

00:30:25.424 --> 00:30:29.127 region:rollup2
NATURE OF THOSE COMPLAINTS.

00:30:27.159 --> 00:30:30.629 region:rollup2
THAT ALSO GOES TO RECORD KEEPING

00:30:29.127 --> 00:30:31.863 region:rollup2
WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH RECORD

00:30:30.629 --> 00:30:33.565 region:rollup2
KEEPING ARE YOU KEEPING THESE

00:30:31.863 --> 00:30:35.734 region:rollup2
PUPPIES PARA COMPLAINTS.

00:30:33.565 --> 00:30:38.136 region:rollup2
HOW ARE YOU ACCESSING THAT DATA

00:30:35.734 --> 00:30:40.105 region:rollup2
WHO IS THAT DATA AVAILABLE FOR I

00:30:38.136 --> 00:30:41.907 region:rollup2
WOULD POSIT AT THE VERY LEAST

00:30:40.105 --> 00:30:43.475 region:rollup2
THAT SHOULD BE AVAILABLE TO

00:30:41.907 --> 00:30:45.343 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATORS? IF I'M AN

00:30:43.475 --> 00:30:46.712 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATOR GOING INTO FIND OUT

00:30:45.343 --> 00:30:47.913 region:rollup2
IF A MEMBER ACTED APPROPRIATELY

00:30:46.712 --> 00:30:49.348 region:rollup2
OR INAPPROPRIATELY IN THE

00:30:47.913 --> 00:30:51.149 region:rollup2
WORKPLACE ONE OF THE FIRST

00:30:49.348 --> 00:30:52.284 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS I WANT TO KNOW IS.

00:30:51.149 --> 00:30:53.819 region:rollup2
WERE THERE ANY PRIOR COMPLAINTS

00:30:52.284 --> 00:30:55.320 region:rollup2
WHAT WHERE THE NATURE OF THOSE

00:30:53.819 --> 00:30:57.155 region:rollup2
COMPLAINTS WHEN DEBATE HER HOW

00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:58.924 region:rollup2
DID THEY RESOLVE. DID ANYTHING

00:30:57.155 --> 00:31:00.625 region:rollup2
HAPPEN TO THAT MEMBER WHERE THEY

00:30:58.924 --> 00:31:02.728 region:rollup2
DISCIPLINED IN ANY WAY OR WAS IT

00:31:00.625 --> 00:31:04.362 region:rollup2
FOUND THAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY NO

00:31:02.728 --> 00:31:05.764 region:rollup2
INAPPROPRIATE CONDUCT HAPPENED.

00:31:04.362 --> 00:31:08.767 region:rollup2
THESE ARE CENTRAL QUESTIONS AND

00:31:05.764 --> 00:31:11.203 region:rollup2
I THINK. OF THIS BODY NEEDS TO.

00:31:08.767 --> 00:31:12.637 region:rollup2
DECIDE WHAT RECORD KEEPING AND

00:31:11.203 --> 00:31:14.573 region:rollup2
THERE ARE CERTAIN CONFINES OF

00:31:12.637 --> 00:31:17.109 region:rollup2
LAW THAT YOU MUST AT.

00:31:14.573 --> 00:31:18.210 region:rollup2
AB ABIDE BY BUT SEPARATE AND

00:31:17.109 --> 00:31:20.612 region:rollup2
APART FROM THAT.

00:31:18.210 --> 00:31:23.048 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF TRANSPARENCY AND

00:31:20.612 --> 00:31:24.616 region:rollup2
ALSO FOR THE BEST PRACTICES

00:31:23.048 --> 00:31:25.984 region:rollup2
THOSE OF PRIOR COMPLAINTS SHOULD

00:31:24.616 --> 00:31:27.119 region:rollup2
BE KEPT SHOULD BE KEPT IN A

00:31:25.984 --> 00:31:28.954 region:rollup2
MANNER THAT IS EASILY ACCESSIBLE

00:31:27.119 --> 00:31:29.588 region:rollup2
IT'S VERY EASY TO

00:31:28.954 --> 00:31:30.622 region:rollup2
BUT THAT IN A DATABASE I'VE SEEN

00:31:29.588 --> 00:31:31.223 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:31:30.622 --> 00:31:34.059 region:rollup2
OTHER STATE AGENCIES THAT I'VE

00:31:31.223 --> 00:31:35.861 region:rollup2
SEEN.

00:31:34.059 --> 00:31:38.964 region:rollup2
WHAT'S THE STANDARD OF PROOF.

00:31:35.861 --> 00:31:39.965 region:rollup2
WHEN ANY FACT FINDER IS LOOKING

00:31:38.964 --> 00:31:42.000 region:rollup2
AT A SET OF FACTS YOU NEED TO

00:31:39.965 --> 00:31:43.268 region:rollup2
KNOW WHAT'S YOUR STANDARD OF

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:44.369 region:rollup2
PROOF IS ITS PREPONDERANCE OF

00:31:43.268 --> 00:31:46.605 region:rollup2
THE EVIDENCE IS THIS CLEARING

00:31:44.369 --> 00:31:47.406 region:rollup2
CONVINCING EVIDENCE.

00:31:46.605 --> 00:31:49.241 region:rollup2
BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT THAT

00:31:47.406 --> 00:31:50.142 region:rollup2
MATTERS.

00:31:49.241 --> 00:31:52.010 region:rollup2
AND THAT HAS NOT BEEN

00:31:50.142 --> 00:31:53.245 region:rollup2
ARTICULATED SO WE NEED TO

00:31:52.010 --> 00:31:55.614 region:rollup2
DETERMINE WHAT OUR STANDARD OF

00:31:53.245 --> 00:31:57.416 region:rollup2
PROOF SAYS. OFTEN INVESTIGATIONS

00:31:55.614 --> 00:31:58.683 region:rollup2
WILL USE A PREPONDERANCE OF THE

00:31:57.416 --> 00:32:00.118 region:rollup2
EVIDENCE WHICH IS MORE LIKELY

00:31:58.683 --> 00:32:01.319 region:rollup2
THAN NOT BUT WHATEVER THE

00:32:00.118 --> 00:32:03.021 region:rollup2
STANDARD OF PROOF YOU'RE GOING

00:32:01.319 --> 00:32:05.757 region:rollup2
TO USE IT NEEDS TO BE UNDERSTOOD

00:32:03.021 --> 00:32:06.425 region:rollup2
ARTICULATED. AND SET FORTH BUT

00:32:05.757 --> 00:32:08.693 region:rollup2
BEFORE YOU START THE

00:32:06.425 --> 00:32:10.495 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATION BECAUSE OTHERWISE

00:32:08.693 --> 00:32:12.330 region:rollup2
HOW DOES THE INVESTIGATOR NO IT

00:32:10.495 --> 00:32:13.899 region:rollup2
HERE SHE IS SUPPOSED TO DO. AND

00:32:12.330 --> 00:32:15.267 region:rollup2
HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED TO EVALUATE

00:32:13.899 --> 00:32:17.736 region:rollup2
THAT EVIDENCE THE FITS.

00:32:15.267 --> 00:32:19.704 region:rollup2
BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT WELL

00:32:17.736 --> 00:32:20.972 region:rollup2
THAT'S A VERY DIFFERENT STANDARD

00:32:19.704 --> 00:32:22.340 region:rollup2
AND I WOULD POSIT THAT WOULD BE

00:32:20.972 --> 00:32:24.342 region:rollup2
AN INAPPROPRIATE STANDARD

00:32:22.340 --> 00:32:25.944 region:rollup2
PARTICULARLY IN THIS CONTEXT AND

00:32:24.342 --> 00:32:29.214 region:rollup2
WHERE YOU'RE LOOKING FOR.

00:32:25.944 --> 00:32:30.882 region:rollup2
ZERO TOLERANCE I WOULD SAY THAT

00:32:29.214 --> 00:32:32.451 region:rollup2
WOULD BE AN ANTHEM A TO THAT.

00:32:30.882 --> 00:32:33.485 region:rollup2
BUT BUT AS A BODY NEED TO MAKE

00:32:32.451 --> 00:32:34.753 region:rollup2
THAT DETERMINATION.

00:32:33.485 --> 00:32:36.321 region:rollup2
ADDITIONALLY WE NEED TO LOOK AT

00:32:34.753 --> 00:32:38.156 region:rollup2
OTHER POTENTIAL CONCERNS FOR

00:32:36.321 --> 00:32:39.925 region:rollup2
BIAS

00:32:38.156 --> 00:32:41.793 region:rollup2
REGARDING THE INVESTIGATORS IF

00:32:39.925 --> 00:32:43.895 region:rollup2
YOU'RE HIRING PEOPLE WHO MAY BE

00:32:41.793 --> 00:32:45.564 region:rollup2
OUT STANDING ATTORNEYS THEY MAY

00:32:43.895 --> 00:32:47.566 region:rollup2
BE VERY FAIR BUT A STATE ALWAYS

00:32:45.564 --> 00:32:49.267 region:rollup2
DEFINED EMPLOYERS. WHAT MESSAGE

00:32:47.566 --> 00:32:50.335 region:rollup2
IS THAT SENDING UT TO THOSE

00:32:49.267 --> 00:32:52.137 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS WHO MIGHT BE

00:32:50.335 --> 00:32:53.572 region:rollup2
COMPLIANCE THEY MAY BE LESS

00:32:52.137 --> 00:32:54.840 region:rollup2
LIKELY?

00:32:53.572 --> 00:32:58.076 region:rollup2
TO GIVE THANK YOU.

00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:59.778 region:rollup2
INFORMATION IF THEY FEEL THAT.

00:32:58.076 --> 00:33:01.813 region:rollup2
THIS IS AFFIRM WHO MAYBE

00:32:59.778 --> 00:33:03.281 region:rollup2
OUTSTANDING.

00:33:01.813 --> 00:33:04.983 region:rollup2
WHO ONLY REPRESENTS EMPLOYERS TO

00:33:03.281 --> 00:33:06.651 region:rollup2
GIVE THE PERCEPTION OF BIAS IN

00:33:04.983 --> 00:33:07.853 region:rollup2
THE PERCEPTION OF BIAS IS JUST

00:33:06.651 --> 00:33:10.856 region:rollup2
AS IMPORTANT TO COMPLAIN AS

00:33:07.853 --> 00:33:12.824 region:rollup2
ACTUAL BIAS?

00:33:10.856 --> 00:33:14.526 region:rollup2
REGARDING THE POLICIES.

00:33:12.824 --> 00:33:15.927 region:rollup2
WHILE I THINK THE POLICIES THAT

00:33:14.526 --> 00:33:17.896 region:rollup2
ARE IN PLACE ARE GOOD START

00:33:15.927 --> 00:33:19.965 region:rollup2
THERE ARE SOME CONFLICTS WITHIN

00:33:17.896 --> 00:33:21.266 region:rollup2
THE POLICIES THEMSELVES. AS IT

00:33:19.965 --> 00:33:23.335 region:rollup2
RELATES TO WHAT'S CONSIDERED A

00:33:21.266 --> 00:33:25.737 region:rollup2
COMPLAINT TO REPORT.

00:33:23.335 --> 00:33:27.772 region:rollup2
THOSE ART. IT APPEARS THAT

00:33:25.737 --> 00:33:30.342 region:rollup2
THERE SOME CONFLICT.

00:33:27.772 --> 00:33:31.710 region:rollup2
I THINK ANY ARTICULATION WHETHER

00:33:30.342 --> 00:33:33.011 region:rollup2
YOU CALL IT A COMPLAINT A REPORT

00:33:31.710 --> 00:33:34.880 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE LOOKED INTO REGARDING

00:33:33.011 --> 00:33:35.747 region:rollup2
HARASSMENT DISCRIMINATION

00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:37.949 region:rollup2
RETALIATION THERE SHOULDN'T BE.

00:33:35.747 --> 00:33:40.919 region:rollup2
.

00:33:37.949 --> 00:33:42.721 region:rollup2
I DIFFERENTIAL IN THE POLICIES

00:33:40.919 --> 00:33:44.122 region:rollup2
REGARDING WHEN YOU INVESTIGATE

00:33:42.721 --> 00:33:45.590 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU DOWN IF YOU RECEIVE

00:33:44.122 --> 00:33:46.691 region:rollup2
INFORMATION THAT THERE'S.

00:33:45.590 --> 00:33:48.660 region:rollup2
DISCRIMINATION HARASSMENT

00:33:46.691 --> 00:33:50.061 region:rollup2
RETALIATION IN THE WORKPLACE

00:33:48.660 --> 00:33:51.796 region:rollup2
THAT SHOULD BE SUBJECT TO AN

00:33:50.061 --> 00:33:54.165 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATION IT SHOULD NOT BE

00:33:51.796 --> 00:33:55.600 region:rollup2
UP TO DISCUSSION. IT COULD BE. A

00:33:54.165 --> 00:33:57.302 region:rollup2
SHORT INVESTIGATION NOTHING

00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:58.069 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY HAPPENED IT COULD BE

00:33:57.302 --> 00:33:59.404 region:rollup2
YOU FIND THAT YOU'RE JUST

00:33:58.069 --> 00:34:00.972 region:rollup2
SCRATCHING THE SURFACE AND

00:33:59.404 --> 00:34:02.340 region:rollup2
THERE'S A LOT OF OTHER VICTIMS

00:34:00.972 --> 00:34:04.109 region:rollup2
BUT HAVING A DIFFERENTIAL IN

00:34:02.340 --> 00:34:06.978 region:rollup2
YOUR OWN POLICIES REGARDING THE

00:34:04.109 --> 00:34:08.580 region:rollup2
TERM. REPORTER COMPLAINT LEAVE

00:34:06.978 --> 00:34:10.682 region:rollup2
SOME THINGS ON THE TABLE ARE

00:34:08.580 --> 00:34:12.217 region:rollup2
THERE. OF WOMEN OR MEN COMING

00:34:10.682 --> 00:34:13.785 region:rollup2
FORWARD INDICATING THAT THERE'S

00:34:12.217 --> 00:34:14.853 region:rollup2
INAPPROPRIATE SEXUAL CONDUCT IN

00:34:13.785 --> 00:34:15.954 region:rollup2
THE WORKPLACE THAT NEVER GETS

00:34:14.853 --> 00:34:17.389 region:rollup2
LOOKED AT BECAUSE IT'S

00:34:15.954 --> 00:34:18.723 region:rollup2
CONSIDERED A REPORT.

00:34:17.389 --> 00:34:20.425 region:rollup2
VERSES A COMPLAINT THAT'S A

00:34:18.723 --> 00:34:21.993 region:rollup2
MAJOR ISSUE.

00:34:20.425 --> 00:34:24.162 region:rollup2
WHO DETERMINES AND HOW THEY

00:34:21.993 --> 00:34:25.730 region:rollup2
DETERMINE WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN IN

00:34:24.162 --> 00:34:27.432 region:rollup2
WHETHER SOMETHING SHOULD BE

00:34:25.730 --> 00:34:28.600 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATED I THINK THAT'S A

00:34:27.432 --> 00:34:30.268 region:rollup2
HOLE IN YOUR POLICIES AND

00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:31.169 region:rollup2
PROCEDURES THAT NEEDS TO BE?

00:34:30.268 --> 00:34:32.938 region:rollup2
LOOKED AT AND CLEARLY

00:34:31.169 --> 00:34:34.773 region:rollup2
ARTICULATED.

00:34:32.938 --> 00:34:36.274 region:rollup2
ADDITIONALLY PERMITTING INTERNAL

00:34:34.773 --> 00:34:38.009 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATIONS AND RESOLUTION BY

00:34:36.274 --> 00:34:38.610 region:rollup2
SUPERVISOR.

00:34:38.009 --> 00:34:40.211 region:rollup2
THAT'S RIGHT WITH CONFLICT IF

00:34:38.610 --> 00:34:41.913 region:rollup2
MY.

00:34:40.211 --> 00:34:43.915 region:rollup2
IF I'M A WOMAN COMPLAINING

00:34:41.913 --> 00:34:44.649 region:rollup2
ABOUT SEXUAL HARASSMENT ABOUT MY

00:34:43.915 --> 00:34:46.017 region:rollup2
SUPERVISOR MY SUPPOSED TO GO

00:34:44.649 --> 00:34:47.552 region:rollup2
TELL MY SUPERVISOR AND MY

00:34:46.017 --> 00:34:49.554 region:rollup2
SUPERVISOR. THEN GETS TO

00:34:47.552 --> 00:34:51.957 region:rollup2
DETERMINE WHAT HAPPENS THAT'S

00:34:49.554 --> 00:34:53.591 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY A SITUATION THAT WE

00:34:51.957 --> 00:34:55.994 region:rollup2
CAN'T ALLOW TO STAND IN THAT'S

00:34:53.591 --> 00:34:58.163 region:rollup2
NOT. A ZERO POLLOCK ZERO

00:34:55.994 --> 00:34:59.531 region:rollup2
TOLERANCE POLICY IN IS CERTAINLY

00:34:58.163 --> 00:35:04.636 region:rollup2
NOTHING THAT WOULD PASS THE

00:34:59.531 --> 00:35:06.171 region:rollup2
SMELL TEST UNDER LOCK.

00:35:04.636 --> 00:35:08.039 region:rollup2
AND AND I THINK THAT LEADS US

00:35:06.171 --> 00:35:10.942 region:rollup2
BACK TO RECORD KEEPING I THINK

00:35:08.039 --> 00:35:13.211 region:rollup2
IN ORDER TO HAVE. BUT WHICH WILL

00:35:10.942 --> 00:35:14.479 region:rollup2
WRAP UP MY TIME. AND THESE ARE

00:35:13.211 --> 00:35:15.547 region:rollup2
ISSUES THAT I THINK THE POLICIES

00:35:14.479 --> 00:35:16.915 region:rollup2
AND PROCEDURES NEED TO BE

00:35:15.547 --> 00:35:18.216 region:rollup2
CLEARLY ARTICULATED THEY NEED TO

00:35:16.915 --> 00:35:19.284 region:rollup2
BE ARTICULATED UP FRONT THE

00:35:18.216 --> 00:35:20.819 region:rollup2
STANDARDS REGARDING

00:35:19.284 --> 00:35:22.020 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATIONS NEED TO BE

00:35:20.819 --> 00:35:25.023 region:rollup2
ARTICULATED UP FRONT.

00:35:22.020 --> 00:35:26.358 region:rollup2
AND THERE NEEDS TO BE OF AN OPEN

00:35:25.023 --> 00:35:28.126 region:rollup2
PLATFORM SO THAT WHEN

00:35:26.358 --> 00:35:29.160 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS DO SEE SOMETHING

00:35:28.126 --> 00:35:30.762 region:rollup2
THEY FEEL COMFORTABLE SAYING

00:35:29.160 --> 00:35:31.630 region:rollup2

ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT

00:37:43.828 --> 00:37:47.632 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES EMPLOYERS FACE IS

00:37:45.930 --> 00:37:49.467 region:rollup2

FREE OF HARASSMENT.

00:38:11.956 --> 00:38:16.895 region:rollup2
ABSENT THAT COMMITMENT IT'S VERY

00:38:13.825 --> 00:38:19.731 region:rollup2
LIKELY ALMOST PROBABLE.

00:38:16.895 --> 00:38:22.634 region:rollup2
ALMOST GUARANTEED THAT SEXUAL

00:38:19.731 --> 00:38:24.435 region:rollup2
HARASSMENT IS GOING TO CONTINUE.

00:38:22.634 --> 00:38:26.738 region:rollup2
ALSO AN ORGANIZATION HAS TO HAVE

ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEMS IN PLACE

00:38:26.738 --> 00:38:30.575 region:rollup2

A MEANINGFUL AND APPROPRIATE

00:38:31.643 --> 00:38:35.680 region:rollup2
MANNER.

CONDUCTING TRAINING.

00:38:37.782 --> 00:38:41.252 region:rollup2

LIP SERVICE ISN'T ENOUGH.

00:38:49.861 --> 00:38:53.932 region:rollup2
ZERO TOLERANCE POLICIES THAT THE

00:38:52.163 --> 00:38:55.867 region:rollup2
ASSEMBLY HAS IN PLACE AND THAT

00:38:53.932 --> 00:38:57.569 region:rollup2
THE SENATE HAS IN PLACE.

00:38:55.867 --> 00:38:58.836 region:rollup2
THEY NEED TO BE COMPLIED WITH BY

00:38:57.569 --> 00:39:00.505 region:rollup2
EVERYBODY WHO WORKS IN THOSE TWO

00:38:58.836 --> 00:39:03.274 region:rollup2
BODIES.

00:39:00.505 --> 00:39:05.043 region:rollup2
NOW I AGREE A WITH MISTER

00:39:03.274 --> 00:39:06.811 region:rollup2
JOHNSON'S COMMENT ON A CONCERN

00:39:05.043 --> 00:39:08.746 region:rollup2
ABOUT ZERO TOLERANCE

00:39:06.811 --> 00:39:11.182 region:rollup2
AND I ALSO AGREE WITH MY

00:39:08.746 --> 00:39:12.417 region:rollup2
PANELISTS WENDY WITH RESPECT TO

00:39:11.182 --> 00:39:14.519 region:rollup2
SOME IMPROVEMENTS THAT CAN BE

00:39:12.417 --> 00:39:16.054 region:rollup2
MADE AND SOME OF THE POLICIES.

00:39:14.519 --> 00:39:17.422 region:rollup2
AND I'D LIKE TO FINISH MY

00:39:16.054 --> 00:39:18.223 region:rollup2
PRESENTATION THE MAYBE ADDRESS

00:39:17.422 --> 00:39:20.458 region:rollup2
SOME OF THOSE.

00:39:18.223 --> 00:39:23.361 region:rollup2
IF WE HAVE TIME.

00:39:20.458 --> 00:39:25.296 region:rollup2
BUT LIP SERVICE IS NOT ENOUGH.

00:39:23.361 --> 00:39:28.099 region:rollup2
LIKE OTHER WORKPLACES AND

00:39:25.296 --> 00:39:29.734 region:rollup2
EMPLOYERS A LIKE OTHER

00:39:28.099 --> 00:39:32.270 region:rollup2
WORKPLACES THIS LEGISLATURE.

00:39:29.734 --> 00:39:34.138 region:rollup2
WILL ALSO CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE

00:39:32.270 --> 00:39:37.575 region:rollup2
WITH POWER DYNAMICS AND THE

00:39:34.138 --> 00:39:38.710 region:rollup2
ISSUE A VERY INFLUENTIAL AND

00:39:37.575 --> 00:39:40.712 region:rollup2
HIGH VALUED EMPLOYEES.

00:39:38.710 --> 00:39:42.847 region:rollup2
AND.

00:39:40.712 --> 00:39:44.415 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATURE HAS VERY HIGH

00:39:42.847 --> 00:39:46.351 region:rollup2
POWERED INFLUENTIAL PEOPLE SOME

00:39:44.415 --> 00:39:48.419 region:rollup2
OF WHOM MAY BELIEVE THAT THE

00:39:46.351 --> 00:39:50.588 region:rollup2
RULES DON'T APPLY TO THEM.

00:39:48.419 --> 00:39:52.557 region:rollup2
OR SOMEONE. WHO MAY BELIEVE

00:39:50.588 --> 00:39:53.591 region:rollup2
GENUINELY ARE NOT?

00:39:52.557 --> 00:39:55.627 region:rollup2
THAT THEIR CONDUCT IS SOMEHOW

00:39:53.591 --> 00:39:56.828 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT THAN THE CONDUCT

00:39:55.627 --> 00:39:59.530 region:rollup2
THAT'S BEING DESCRIBED IN A

00:39:56.828 --> 00:40:01.366 region:rollup2
POLICY WERE BEING DISCUSSED IN A

00:39:59.530 --> 00:40:02.867 region:rollup2
TRAINING SESSION.

00:40:01.366 --> 00:40:04.669 region:rollup2
BUT THERE CAN BE NO EXCEPTIONS

00:40:02.867 --> 00:40:06.638 region:rollup2
NONE.

00:40:04.669 --> 00:40:08.339 region:rollup2
THESE INDIVIDUALS REGARDLESS OF

00:40:06.638 --> 00:40:10.241 region:rollup2
THEIR STATURE. MUST BE HELD TO

00:40:08.339 --> 00:40:10.775 region:rollup2
THE SAME STANDARDS AND MUST BE

00:40:10.241 --> 00:40:13.144 region:rollup2
HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR

00:40:10.775 --> 00:40:14.545 region:rollup2
CONDUCT.

00:40:13.144 --> 00:40:16.614 region:rollup2
IN ADDITION A POWER DYNAMIC

00:40:14.545 --> 00:40:18.082 region:rollup2
SEXUAL HARASSMENT OFTEN INVOLVES

00:40:16.614 --> 00:40:20.752 region:rollup2
BIASES.

00:40:18.082 --> 00:40:22.654 region:rollup2
BOTH CONSCIOUS AND UNCONSCIOUS.

00:40:20.752 --> 00:40:24.455 region:rollup2
IN STYRIA TYPES ABOUT THE ROLES

00:40:22.654 --> 00:40:26.457 region:rollup2
OF MEN AND WOMEN IN OUR SOCIETY

00:40:24.455 --> 00:40:29.127 region:rollup2
AND IN OUR WORKPLACE.

00:40:26.457 --> 00:40:32.363 region:rollup2
AND I SUBMIT TO YOU THAT PART OF

00:40:29.127 --> 00:40:34.332 region:rollup2
A RIGOROUS EFFECTIVE TRAINING

00:40:32.363 --> 00:40:36.034 region:rollup2
PROGRAM TO PREVENT HARASSMENT IN

00:40:34.332 --> 00:40:38.202 region:rollup2
THE WORKPLACE MUST ADDRESS

00:40:36.034 --> 00:40:39.871 region:rollup2
BIASES.

00:40:38.202 --> 00:40:42.507 region:rollup2
NOT JUST RECOGNIZING THAT THEY

00:40:39.871 --> 00:40:44.742 region:rollup2
EXIST BUT ACTUALLY EXPLORING

00:40:42.507 --> 00:40:46.344 region:rollup2
TOOLS TO COMBAT THEM.

00:40:44.742 --> 00:40:48.079 region:rollup2
THERE ARE MANY STUDIES OUT THERE

00:40:46.344 --> 00:40:50.148 region:rollup2
THAT SHOW WE ALL HAVE

00:40:48.079 --> 00:40:51.549 region:rollup2
UNCONSCIOUS BIASES EVERY SINGLE

00:40:50.148 --> 00:40:52.684 region:rollup2
ONE OF US THERE'S A PRINCETON

00:40:51.549 --> 00:40:54.218 region:rollup2
STUDY THAT SAID THE SECOND YOU

00:40:52.684 --> 00:40:55.520 region:rollup2
SAW MY FACE YOU MADE A DECISION

00:40:54.218 --> 00:40:56.621 region:rollup2
OF WHO I AM.

00:40:55.520 --> 00:40:59.057 region:rollup2
AND THE SECOND I SAW YOU ALL

00:40:56.621 --> 00:41:01.159 region:rollup2
YOUR FACES I DID THE SAME THING.

00:40:59.057 --> 00:41:03.328 region:rollup2
WE OPERATE ON UNCONSCIOUS BIASES

00:41:01.159 --> 00:41:05.396 region:rollup2
AND WERE NOT AWARE OF IT.

00:41:03.328 --> 00:41:07.365 region:rollup2
DOESN'T MAKE US BAD BUT IT DOES

00:41:05.396 --> 00:41:09.334 region:rollup2
MANDATE.

00:41:07.365 --> 00:41:10.835 region:rollup2
THAT WE USE SELF REFLECTION TO

00:41:09.334 --> 00:41:12.904 region:rollup2
DETERMINE IF SOME OF THOSE

00:41:10.835 --> 00:41:15.506 region:rollup2
BIASES ARE NEGATIVE PREJUDICES

00:41:12.904 --> 00:41:17.041 region:rollup2
THAT ARE MOTIVATING OUR ACTIONS

00:41:15.506 --> 00:41:18.609 region:rollup2
AND CONDUCT IN RELATION TO OTHER

00:41:17.041 --> 00:41:19.911 region:rollup2
PEOPLE.

00:41:18.609 --> 00:41:21.746 region:rollup2
AND THERE ARE LOTS OF RESOURCES

00:41:19.911 --> 00:41:23.548 region:rollup2
TO HELP THIS BODY DO THAT OCCUR

00:41:21.746 --> 00:41:24.215 region:rollup2
WHEN INSTITUTE.

00:41:23.548 --> 00:41:26.484 region:rollup2
THE.

00:41:24.215 --> 00:41:28.886 region:rollup2
COOK ROSS A WOMAN OWN

00:41:26.484 --> 00:41:30.154 region:rollup2
CONSULTING FIRM THAT SPECIALIZES

00:41:28.886 --> 00:41:31.789 region:rollup2
IN THIS I BELIEVE IN YOUR

00:41:30.154 --> 00:41:33.825 region:rollup2
PREVIOUS HEARING YOU HAD.

00:41:31.789 --> 00:41:35.827 region:rollup2
.

00:41:33.825 --> 00:41:36.694 region:rollup2
A A SPEAKER WHO ADDRESSED THIS

00:41:35.827 --> 00:41:39.263 region:rollup2
ISSUE THERE ARE LOTS OF

00:41:36.694 --> 00:41:40.398 region:rollup2
RESOURCES.

00:41:39.263 --> 00:41:42.233 region:rollup2
ANOTHER CHALLENGE FACED BY

00:41:40.398 --> 00:41:44.736 region:rollup2
EMPLOYERS IS THAT EMPLOYERS HAVE

00:41:42.233 --> 00:41:46.104 region:rollup2
TO BALANCE EMPLOYEE RIGHTS WHEN

00:41:44.736 --> 00:41:48.072 region:rollup2
TAKING ACTION IN RESPONSE TO

00:41:46.104 --> 00:41:50.108 region:rollup2
SEXUAL HARASSMENT.

00:41:48.072 --> 00:41:52.276 region:rollup2
UNDER THE LAW WELL EMPLOYER HAS

00:41:50.108 --> 00:41:54.345 region:rollup2
A DUTY TO TAKE ACTION THAT IS

00:41:52.276 --> 00:41:56.047 region:rollup2
REASONABLY CALCULATED TO END

00:41:54.345 --> 00:41:57.949 region:rollup2
SEXUAL HARASSMENT.

00:41:56.047 --> 00:42:00.218 region:rollup2
IT MUST ALSO CONSIDER RIGHTS OF

00:41:57.949 --> 00:42:02.186 region:rollup2
THE ACCUSED UNTIL SUCH TIME AS

00:42:00.218 --> 00:42:04.589 region:rollup2
THE DIRT DETERMINATION IS MADE

00:42:02.186 --> 00:42:06.491 region:rollup2
THAT SEXUAL HARASSMENT OCCURRED.

00:42:04.589 --> 00:42:08.526 region:rollup2
EMPLOYERS MAY FEEL AS IF THEY'RE

00:42:06.491 --> 00:42:10.895 region:rollup2
CAUGHT IN A DOUBLE BIND WHEN

00:42:08.526 --> 00:42:12.363 region:rollup2
DETERMINING WHAT STEPS TO TAKE

00:42:10.895 --> 00:42:13.564 region:rollup2
WHAT EFFECTIVE DISCIPLINARY

00:42:12.363 --> 00:42:15.967 region:rollup2
MEASURES TO IMPLEMENT TO STOP

00:42:13.564 --> 00:42:17.568 region:rollup2
HARASSMENT.

00:42:15.967 --> 00:42:19.537 region:rollup2
THERE IS CASE LAW THAT SAYS THE

00:42:17.568 --> 00:42:21.539 region:rollup2
DISCIPLINARY A REMEDIAL ACTION

00:42:19.537 --> 00:42:22.874 region:rollup2
THAT IS TAKEN CANNOT BE OR

00:42:21.539 --> 00:42:25.043 region:rollup2
SHOULD NOT BE DISPROPORTIONATE

00:42:22.874 --> 00:42:26.611 region:rollup2
WITH THE HARASSING CONDUCT.

00:42:25.043 --> 00:42:29.013 region:rollup2
THERE'S ALSO ISSUES EMPLOYERS

00:42:26.611 --> 00:42:31.182 region:rollup2
FACE WITH POTENTIAL LEGAL SUITS

00:42:29.013 --> 00:42:32.917 region:rollup2
FROM THE ACCUSED.

00:42:31.182 --> 00:42:35.353 region:rollup2
NOT JUST THE HARASSER I MEAN NOT

00:42:32.917 --> 00:42:37.121 region:rollup2
JUST THE VICTIM OF HARASSMENT

00:42:35.353 --> 00:42:39.290 region:rollup2
POTENTIALLY WRONGFUL TERMINATION

00:42:37.121 --> 00:42:40.224 region:rollup2
CASES THEIR DEFAMATION CASES

00:42:39.290 --> 00:42:43.194 region:rollup2
THAT ARE BEING.

00:42:40.224 --> 00:42:45.296 region:rollup2
DEFENDED IN COURT AND THIS

00:42:43.194 --> 00:42:46.197 region:rollup2
HAPPENS IF AN EMPLOYER FAILS TO

00:42:45.296 --> 00:42:48.099 region:rollup2
HAVE FAIR OBJECTIVE

00:42:46.197 --> 00:42:49.500 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATIONS TO GIVE ALL

00:42:48.099 --> 00:42:51.602 region:rollup2
PARTIES AN OPPORTUNITY TO

00:42:49.500 --> 00:42:53.137 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATE. OR IF AN EMPLOYER

00:42:51.602 --> 00:42:55.573 region:rollup2
JUMPS TO QUICKLY TO MAKE

00:42:53.137 --> 00:42:58.042 region:rollup2
DISCIPLINARY DECISIONS BASED ON

00:42:55.573 --> 00:42:59.677 region:rollup2
FAULTY FINDINGS.

00:42:58.042 --> 00:43:02.213 region:rollup2
THEREFORE IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT

00:42:59.677 --> 00:43:02.980 region:rollup2
IN ANY ANTI HARASSMENT PROGRAM

00:43:02.213 --> 00:43:05.183 region:rollup2
THAT AN INVESTIGATION BEEF

00:43:02.980 --> 00:43:08.553 region:rollup2
PROMPT

00:43:05.183 --> 00:43:10.922 region:rollup2
FAIR NEUTRAL AND OBJECTIVE. MIT

00:43:08.553 --> 00:43:12.723 region:rollup2
COLLEAGUE WENDY IDENTIFIED IT IS

00:43:10.922 --> 00:43:13.524 region:rollup2
VERY IMPORTANT UP FRONT TO

00:43:12.723 --> 00:43:14.125 region:rollup2
DETERMINE IF THERE'S CONFLICTS

00:43:13.524 --> 00:43:18.095 region:rollup2
OF INTEREST OR BIASES.

00:43:14.125 --> 00:43:18.996 region:rollup2
TO HAVE THE RIGHT.

00:43:18.095 --> 00:43:20.498 region:rollup2
ALL PARTIES IN THAT

00:43:18.996 --> 00:43:22.266 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATION HAVE TO BE GIVEN

00:43:20.498 --> 00:43:25.736 region:rollup2
THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE.

00:43:22.266 --> 00:43:29.273 region:rollup2
AND HEARD BEFORE ANY FINDING IS

00:43:25.736 --> 00:43:31.843 region:rollup2
MADE AN ACTION IS TAKEN.

00:43:29.273 --> 00:43:33.845 region:rollup2
FINALLY. EMPLOYERS CONTINUE TO

00:43:31.843 --> 00:43:35.513 region:rollup2
STRUGGLE WITH THEIR STRICT

00:43:33.845 --> 00:43:37.715 region:rollup2
LIABILITY FOR SUPERVISOR

HARASSMENT.

00:43:37.715 --> 00:43:40.451 region:rollup2
IF SEXUAL HARASSMENT IS

00:43:38.916 --> 00:43:42.987 region:rollup2
COMMITTED BY A SUPERVISOR AN

00:43:40.451 --> 00:43:45.289 region:rollup2
EMPLOYER IS STRICTLY LIABLE EVEN

OF AN ENTITY IN THIS CASE EVEN

00:43:46.524 --> 00:43:48.893 region:rollup2
IF.

00:43:48.092 --> 00:43:51.329 region:rollup2
THE.

00:43:48.893 --> 00:43:52.797 region:rollup2
MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY AND

00:43:51.329 --> 00:43:54.665 region:rollup2
SENATE HAD NO IDEA THAT A

00:43:52.797 --> 00:43:55.566 region:rollup2
SUPERVISING EMPLOYEE HAD THE

00:43:54.665 --> 00:43:57.201 region:rollup2
PROPENSITY TO ENGAGE IN THAT

00:43:55.566 --> 00:43:59.203 region:rollup2
CONDUCT.

00:43:57.201 --> 00:44:00.705 region:rollup2
WELL FEDERAL LAW MIGHT PROVIDE

00:43:59.203 --> 00:44:02.073 region:rollup2
LIMITED DEFENSES UNDER TITLE

00:44:00.705 --> 00:44:03.674 region:rollup2
SEVEN UNDER WHAT'S KNOWN AS THE

00:44:02.073 --> 00:44:06.144 region:rollup2
LA A FAIR DEFENSE

00:44:03.674 --> 00:44:08.146 region:rollup2
TO EMPLOYER LIABILITY WHEN A

SUPERVISOR. IS BAD FOUND TO HAVE

00:44:08.146 --> 00:44:11.415 region:rollup2
A RAST.

00:44:09.780 --> 00:44:13.050 region:rollup2
THERE IS NO DEFENSE TO LIABILITY

00:44:11.415 --> 00:44:15.319 region:rollup2
UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW.

00:44:13.050 --> 00:44:16.654 region:rollup2
NOW THERE MAY BE A POTENTIAL TO

REDUCE DAMAGES UNDER WHAT IS

00:44:16.654 --> 00:44:19.190 region:rollup2

00:44:23.528 --> 00:44:27.431 region:rollup2
CONSEQUENTLY EMPLOYERS LIKE THIS

00:44:25.530 --> 00:44:28.900 region:rollup2

00:44:27.431 --> 00:44:30.835 region:rollup2
HARSH REALITY.

00:44:28.900 --> 00:44:31.369 region:rollup2
BUT EVEN IF THEY HAVE A ROBUST

00:44:52.189 --> 00:44:55.960 region:rollup2
THEY STILL FACE.

LIABILITY.

00:44:55.960 --> 00:44:59.997 region:rollup2

ENGAGES IN HARASSMENT.

00:45:02.233 --> 00:45:05.503 region:rollup2
NOW I NO ONE OF THE GOVERNMENT

00:45:03.167 --> 00:45:07.405 region:rollup2
CODE THE LEGISLATURE MAY HAVE

00:45:05.503 --> 00:45:08.706 region:rollup2
SOME RECOURSE IN RECOUP.

00:45:07.405 --> 00:45:10.441 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW DEFENSE COSTS OR

00:45:08.706 --> 00:45:13.211 region:rollup2
SOMETHING TO A MEMBER OR SENATOR

00:45:10.441 --> 00:45:15.413 region:rollup2
WHO IF HERE SHE HAPPENS TO BE.

00:45:13.211 --> 00:45:16.814 region:rollup2
THE HARASSER IN THAT SITUATION

00:45:15.413 --> 00:45:19.584 region:rollup2
BUT

00:45:16.814 --> 00:45:20.585 region:rollup2
THE FACT REMAINS LIABILITY.

00:45:19.584 --> 00:45:23.020 region:rollup2
IS ATTACHED UNDER STRICT

00:45:20.585 --> 00:45:23.554 region:rollup2
LIABILITY.

00:45:23.020 --> 00:45:26.090 region:rollup2
WHAT'S THE ANSWER FOR THE

00:45:23.554 --> 00:45:26.657 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE.

00:45:26.090 --> 00:45:28.726 region:rollup2
NOT SURE THERE IS A PERFECT

00:45:26.657 --> 00:45:30.861 region:rollup2
ANSWER.

00:45:28.726 --> 00:45:32.797 region:rollup2
EMPLOYERS ARE NOT SEEKING TO

00:45:30.861 --> 00:45:33.864 region:rollup2
AVOID LIABILITY WHEN IT'S BEEN

00:45:32.797 --> 00:45:36.300 region:rollup2
DETERMINED THAT THEY'VE DONE

00:45:33.864 --> 00:45:37.702 region:rollup2
SOMETHING WRONG.

00:45:36.300 --> 00:45:39.170 region:rollup2
INSTEAD WHAT THEY'RE WISHING TO

00:45:37.702 --> 00:45:40.638 region:rollup2
SEEK.

00:45:39.170 --> 00:45:42.240 region:rollup2
IS TO HAVE A MEANINGFUL DEFENSE

00:45:40.638 --> 00:45:44.108 region:rollup2
WHEN IT'S DETERMINED THAT THEY

00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:46.611 region:rollup2
DID THINGS RIGHT.

00:45:44.108 --> 00:45:49.880 region:rollup2
BUT YET A ROGUE SUPERVISOR STILL

00:45:46.611 --> 00:45:52.149 region:rollup2
ENGAGED IN HARASSMENT.

00:45:49.880 --> 00:45:53.184 region:rollup2
MAYBE ONE OF THE ANSWERS.

00:45:52.149 --> 00:45:55.019 region:rollup2
UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW AS AN

00:45:53.184 --> 00:45:56.887 region:rollup2
AMENDMENT TO THE FAIR EMPLOYMENT

00:45:55.019 --> 00:45:58.789 region:rollup2
HOUSING ACT TO. COME UP WITH THE

00:45:56.887 --> 00:45:59.790 region:rollup2
DEFENSE IN LINE WITH

00:45:58.789 --> 00:46:02.059 region:rollup2
INCOMPARABLE TO THE HOURS FAIR

00:45:59.790 --> 00:46:02.460 region:rollup2
DEFENSE.

00:46:02.059 --> 00:46:06.130 region:rollup2
I BELIEVE THAT.

00:46:02.460 --> 00:46:07.665 region:rollup2
IDEA IN YOUR CAPABLE HANDS.

00:46:06.130 --> 00:46:09.100 region:rollup2
I WOULD LIKE TO JUST ADDRESS A

00:46:07.665 --> 00:46:10.768 region:rollup2
FEW THINGS IN THE POLICY SOME OF

00:46:09.100 --> 00:46:12.703 region:rollup2
WHICH AND.

00:46:10.768 --> 00:46:14.505 region:rollup2
THE OTHER PANEL MEMBERS HAVE

00:46:12.703 --> 00:46:16.307 region:rollup2
DISCUSSED THE ZERO TOLERANCE

00:46:14.505 --> 00:46:17.875 region:rollup2
POLICY THAT IS EXPRESSED IN BOTH

00:46:16.307 --> 00:46:19.543 region:rollup2
THE SENATE'S POLICY AGAINST

00:46:17.875 --> 00:46:22.380 region:rollup2
HARASSMENT AND THE ASSEMBLIES.

00:46:19.543 --> 00:46:24.482 region:rollup2
UP POLICY AGAINST HARASSMENT

00:46:22.380 --> 00:46:26.183 region:rollup2
COULD RAISE SOME CONCERNS

00:46:24.482 --> 00:46:29.020 region:rollup2
BECAUSE AS MS JOHNSON SAID IT

00:46:26.183 --> 00:46:30.521 region:rollup2
DOES SEEM TO CONVEY THAT ANY.

00:46:29.020 --> 00:46:32.089 region:rollup2
FORM OF HARASSMENT RESULTS

00:46:30.521 --> 00:46:33.791 region:rollup2
ULTIMATELY IN TERMINATION OF

00:46:32.089 --> 00:46:35.159 region:rollup2
EMPLOYMENT AND AS I INDICATED

00:46:33.791 --> 00:46:37.695 region:rollup2
THERE IS CASE LAW THAT MAKES

00:46:35.159 --> 00:46:39.563 region:rollup2
CLEAR THAT DISCIPLINARY ACTION

00:46:37.695 --> 00:46:40.731 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE APPROPRIATE.

00:46:39.563 --> 00:46:43.668 region:rollup2
BASED ON THE FINDINGS OF AN

00:46:40.731 --> 00:46:45.236 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATION AND THE EXTENT AN

00:46:43.668 --> 00:46:47.038 region:rollup2
EGREGIOUS NESS OF THE HARASSMENT

00:46:45.236 --> 00:46:47.738 region:rollup2
THEREFORE IT MAY NOT BE

00:46:47.038 --> 00:46:49.440 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE MAY BE

00:46:47.738 --> 00:46:50.741 region:rollup2
DISPROPORTIONATE AND THAT TO

00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:52.810 region:rollup2
HAVE AN ABSOLUTE ZERO TOLERANCE

00:46:50.741 --> 00:46:54.712 region:rollup2
POLICY.

00:46:52.810 --> 00:46:56.747 region:rollup2
THE ASSEMBLY POLICY ALSO SEEMS

00:46:54.712 --> 00:47:00.251 region:rollup2
TO INDICATE THAT.

00:46:56.747 --> 00:47:01.652 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATIONS WILL BE DONE IF

00:47:00.251 --> 00:47:04.889 region:rollup2
A COMPLAINT OF INAPPROPRIATE

00:47:01.652 --> 00:47:07.258 region:rollup2
HARASSING CONDUCT IS MADE WITHIN

00:47:04.889 --> 00:47:09.060 region:rollup2
ONE YEAR OF THE CONDUCT NIGH

00:47:07.258 --> 00:47:10.995 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDABLE I BELIEVE I

00:47:09.060 --> 00:47:12.830 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND THE RATIONALE FOR

00:47:10.995 --> 00:47:14.365 region:rollup2
THAT TIME LIMIT IT'S IN LINE

00:47:12.830 --> 00:47:17.068 region:rollup2
WITH THE CURRENT ONE YEAR.

00:47:14.365 --> 00:47:19.203 region:rollup2
PERIOD IN WHICH EMPLOYEES CAN

00:47:17.068 --> 00:47:20.738 region:rollup2
REPORT TO THE DFV AGE HOWEVER I

00:47:19.203 --> 00:47:22.940 region:rollup2
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT.

00:47:20.738 --> 00:47:25.076 region:rollup2
TO BE MINDFUL OF TWO THINGS.

00:47:22.940 --> 00:47:27.044 region:rollup2
EMPLOYERS SHOULD NEVER DENY

00:47:25.076 --> 00:47:28.646 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATING INAPPROPRIATE

00:47:27.044 --> 00:47:30.114 region:rollup2
CONDUCT IN THE WORKPLACE NO

00:47:28.646 --> 00:47:31.215 region:rollup2
MATTER WHEN IT'S BROUGHT FORWARD

00:47:30.114 --> 00:47:33.984 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE ALWAYS HAVE A

00:47:31.215 --> 00:47:35.553 region:rollup2
CONTINUING DUTY TO MAKE SURE AND

00:47:33.984 --> 00:47:37.521 region:rollup2
AS. MY PANELISTS WENDY POINTED

00:47:35.553 --> 00:47:38.989 region:rollup2
OUT THERE MAY BE OTHER CONDUCT

00:47:37.521 --> 00:47:40.091 region:rollup2
THAT'S GOING ON WITH RESPECT TO

00:47:38.989 --> 00:47:41.492 region:rollup2
THE CO WORKERS OF THAT PERSON

00:47:40.091 --> 00:47:42.993 region:rollup2
WHO COMES FORWARD AND IT'S OUR

00:47:41.492 --> 00:47:44.261 region:rollup2
DUTY AS EMPLOYERS TO GET TO THE

00:47:42.993 --> 00:47:45.596 region:rollup2
BOTTOM UP.

00:47:44.261 --> 00:47:47.565 region:rollup2
BUT FROM A LEGAL STANDPOINT

00:47:45.596 --> 00:47:48.432 region:rollup2
THERE IS ALSO A DOCTRINE CALLED

00:47:47.565 --> 00:47:50.334 region:rollup2
THE AVOIDABLE.

00:47:48.432 --> 00:47:53.270 region:rollup2
THE CONTINUING VIOLATION

00:47:50.334 --> 00:47:55.372 region:rollup2
DOCTRINE AND SO YOU MAY HAVE AN

00:47:53.270 --> 00:47:56.407 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEE WHO COMES IN REPORT

00:47:55.372 --> 00:47:58.342 region:rollup2
SOMETHING TO YOU THAT HAPPENED

00:47:56.407 --> 00:48:01.078 region:rollup2
OVER YOU SOMETHING EGREGIOUS

00:47:58.342 --> 00:48:01.712 region:rollup2
POTENTIALLY THAT HAPPENED OVER A

00:48:01.078 --> 00:48:02.713 region:rollup2
YEAR AGO WHEN YOU THINK AND YOUR

00:48:01.712 --> 00:48:04.248 region:rollup2
PA.

00:48:02.713 --> 00:48:06.016 region:rollup2
SEE THEY DIDN'T REPORT IT TIMELY

00:48:04.248 --> 00:48:06.784 region:rollup2
BUT IF OTHER MICRO INEQUITIES

00:48:06.016 --> 00:48:08.219 region:rollup2
AND HARASSING INAPPROPRIATE

00:48:06.784 --> 00:48:10.688 region:rollup2
CONDUCT IS

00:48:08.219 --> 00:48:12.757 region:rollup2
AND WITHIN THAT ONE YEAR PERIOD.

00:48:10.688 --> 00:48:14.392 region:rollup2
THAT EGREGIOUS CONDUCT THAT WAS

00:48:12.757 --> 00:48:16.160 region:rollup2
HAPPENING OVER YEAR AGO CAN BE

00:48:14.392 --> 00:48:18.396 region:rollup2
BROUGHT IN. TO THE CURRENT.

00:48:16.160 --> 00:48:20.498 region:rollup2
AND.

00:48:18.396 --> 00:48:21.999 region:rollup2
EVALUATION OF WHETHER WE HAVE A

00:48:20.498 --> 00:48:22.666 region:rollup2
HOSTILE WORK NVIRONMENT OR SOME

00:48:21.999 --> 00:48:24.034 region:rollup2
OTHER HARASSMENT IN THE

00:48:22.666 --> 00:48:26.036 region:rollup2
WORKPLACE AND ACTIONABLE

00:48:24.034 --> 00:48:27.805 region:rollup2
HARASSMENT. SO WE SHOULD NEVER

00:48:26.036 --> 00:48:30.040 region:rollup2
PUT A TIME LIMIT THAT WE SHOULD

00:48:27.805 --> 00:48:31.509 region:rollup2
ENCOURAGE PROMPT REPORTING SO

00:48:30.040 --> 00:48:32.676 region:rollup2
THAT WE CAN FULFILL OUR DUTIES

00:48:31.509 --> 00:48:34.578 region:rollup2
TO TAKE PROMPT ACTION AND

00:48:32.676 --> 00:48:36.714 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATE BUT WE SHOULD NEVER

00:48:34.578 --> 00:48:38.349 region:rollup2
PUT A TIME LIMIT. AND SAY THAT

00:48:36.714 --> 00:48:39.283 region:rollup2
WE WILL ONLY INVESTIGATE IF YOU

00:48:38.349 --> 00:48:40.351 region:rollup2
WERE IF YOU REPORTED WITHIN A

00:48:39.283 --> 00:48:42.153 region:rollup2
YEAR.

00:48:40.351 --> 00:48:43.988 region:rollup2
.

00:48:42.153 --> 00:48:44.555 region:rollup2
THE OTHER ISSUE THAT'S REYES AND

00:48:43.988 --> 00:48:46.791 region:rollup2
MY.

00:48:44.555 --> 00:48:48.559 region:rollup2
PANELIST WENDY ADDRESSED IT

00:48:46.791 --> 00:48:50.227 region:rollup2
WITH RESPECT TO THE REPORTING IN

00:48:48.559 --> 00:48:52.396 region:rollup2
RESOLUTION OF SOME COMPLAINTS BY

00:48:50.227 --> 00:48:54.565 region:rollup2
A SUPERVISOR. SHE BROUGHT FORTH

00:48:52.396 --> 00:48:55.466 region:rollup2
A VERY GOOD POINT THAT IF THE

00:48:54.565 --> 00:48:57.601 region:rollup2
SUPERVISORS THERE ISN'T IT

00:48:55.466 --> 00:48:59.069 region:rollup2
SUPERVISOR IS THE HARASSER THEN

00:48:57.601 --> 00:49:00.171 region:rollup2
IT SURELY NOT.

00:48:59.069 --> 00:49:02.573 region:rollup2
S. THE REPORTING POINT THAT AN

00:49:00.171 --> 00:49:04.542 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEE HAS TO GO TO.

00:49:02.573 --> 00:49:06.577 region:rollup2
BUT EVEN MORE SO.

00:49:04.542 --> 00:49:09.180 region:rollup2
A SUPERVISOR SHOULD NEVER BE THE

00:49:06.577 --> 00:49:11.382 region:rollup2
ONE TO INVESTIGATE OR RESOLVE

00:49:09.180 --> 00:49:13.751 region:rollup2
ANY CLAIM OF HARASSMENT EVEN

00:49:11.382 --> 00:49:15.286 region:rollup2
BETWEEN CO COURTS AND PEERS IF

00:49:13.751 --> 00:49:17.588 region:rollup2
THAT SUPERVISOR HAS NOT BEEN

00:49:15.286 --> 00:49:19.390 region:rollup2
TRAINED ON HOW TO DO THAT.

00:49:17.588 --> 00:49:20.858 region:rollup2
THAT CAN ONLY EXPOSE THE

00:49:19.390 --> 00:49:23.060 region:rollup2
EMPLOYER TO MORE LIABILITY IF

00:49:20.858 --> 00:49:24.528 region:rollup2
THEY GET IT WRONG.

00:49:23.060 --> 00:49:25.162 region:rollup2
THANK YOU VERY OUGHT AND MUCH

00:49:24.528 --> 00:49:27.765 region:rollup2
FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO

00:49:25.162 --> 00:49:28.299 region:rollup2
YOU.

00:49:27.765 --> 00:49:31.001 region:rollup2
THANK YOU THAT'S ALL I'M.

REALLY.

00:49:31.001 --> 00:49:33.904 region:rollup2
GREAT AND VERY COMPREHENSIVE

00:49:32.736 --> 00:49:35.439 region:rollup2
INFORMATION.

00:49:33.904 --> 00:49:37.007 region:rollup2
I'M GOING TO OPEN THE PANEL UP

00:49:35.439 --> 00:49:38.709 region:rollup2
NOW TO QUESTIONS AND WE HAVE OUR

00:49:37.007 --> 00:49:39.877 region:rollup2
THIRD PANELIST AVAILABLE SO

00:49:38.709 --> 00:49:41.412 region:rollup2
CALLED ALL START WITH A COUPLE

00:49:39.877 --> 00:49:42.613 region:rollup2
OF QUESTIONS.

00:49:41.412 --> 00:49:44.448 region:rollup2
SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT YOU

00:49:42.613 --> 00:49:45.549 region:rollup2
MENTIONED THAT YOU TALKED ABOUT

00:49:44.448 --> 00:49:47.585 region:rollup2
THANK YOU THAT I'VE BEEN TRYING

00:49:45.549 --> 00:49:49.787 region:rollup2
TO GRAPPLE WITH MY OWN MIND.

00:49:47.585 --> 00:49:52.122 region:rollup2
I'M HAS TO DO WITH.

00:49:49.787 --> 00:49:53.624 region:rollup2
THE IDEA OF THE ZERO ZERO

00:49:52.122 --> 00:49:55.559 region:rollup2
TOLERANCE AS YOU TALKED ABOUT AS

00:49:53.624 --> 00:49:56.760 region:rollup2
BEING IN SOME WAYS PROBLEMATIC

00:49:55.559 --> 00:49:58.128 region:rollup2
BUT ALSO WANTING TO MAKE SURE WE

00:49:56.760 --> 00:49:59.897 region:rollup2
HAVE ACCOUNTABILITY AND WE DON'T

00:49:58.128 --> 00:50:01.765 region:rollup2
ALLOW WORK. PLACE ABUSES TO

00:49:59.897 --> 00:50:03.300 region:rollup2
CONTINUE I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAD

00:50:01.765 --> 00:50:05.636 region:rollup2
A CHANCE TO SEE OUR LAST PANEL

00:50:03.300 --> 00:50:08.506 region:rollup2
BUT WE HAD ARM PEOPLE FROM THE

00:50:05.636 --> 00:50:09.139 region:rollup2
HUMAN RESOURCES WORLD COME IN

00:50:08.506 --> 00:50:10.140 region:rollup2
AND WE ALSO HAD A PROFESSOR WHO

00:50:09.139 --> 00:50:11.876 region:rollup2
SAID.

00:50:10.140 --> 00:50:12.977 region:rollup2
ACTUAL HARASSMENT

00:50:11.876 --> 00:50:14.678 region:rollup2
AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THEY

00:50:12.977 --> 00:50:15.513 region:rollup2
ALL SAID PRETTY CONSISTENTLY WAS

00:50:14.678 --> 00:50:17.314 region:rollup2
THAT YOU DO NEED TO HAVE

00:50:15.513 --> 00:50:19.116 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABILITY.

00:50:17.314 --> 00:50:21.085 region:rollup2
BUT AT THE SAME TIME YOU WANT TO

00:50:19.116 --> 00:50:22.353 region:rollup2
GET TO A WORKPLACE WHERE.

00:50:21.085 --> 00:50:23.754 region:rollup2
PEOPLE FEEL GOOD COMING TO WORK

00:50:22.353 --> 00:50:26.257 region:rollup2
WHERE YOU HAVE MUTUAL RESPECT

00:50:23.754 --> 00:50:28.659 region:rollup2
AND THAT THE MORE YOU FOCUS ON

00:50:26.257 --> 00:50:30.995 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABILITY AND PUNISHMENT.

00:50:28.659 --> 00:50:33.130 region:rollup2
ON THE MORE TOXIC OF A WORKPLACE

00:50:30.995 --> 00:50:34.698 region:rollup2
YOU CAN CREATE BECAUSE PEOPLE

00:50:33.130 --> 00:50:35.266 region:rollup2
BECOME AFRAID THEY'RE AFRAID OF

00:50:34.698 --> 00:50:36.333 region:rollup2
THEIR INTERACTIONS WITH EACH

00:50:35.266 --> 00:50:37.935 region:rollup2
OTHER.

00:50:36.333 --> 00:50:39.036 region:rollup2
AND IFEEL LIKE WE'RE GETTING TO

00:50:37.935 --> 00:50:41.005 region:rollup2
A PLACE HERE IN THE CAPITAL

00:50:39.036 --> 00:50:43.340 region:rollup2
QUITE HONESTLY WHERE PEOPLE ARE

00:50:41.005 --> 00:50:44.842 region:rollup2
AFRAID THEY'RE AFRAID OF. OF OF

00:50:43.340 --> 00:50:46.443 region:rollup2
WHETHER THEIR BEHAVIOR CROSSES

00:50:44.842 --> 00:50:47.578 region:rollup2
THE LINE O MAKE MY QUESTION IS

00:50:46.443 --> 00:50:49.480 region:rollup2
BOTH ABOUT WHERE IS THAT LINE

00:50:47.578 --> 00:50:50.748 region:rollup2
AND HOW.

00:50:49.480 --> 00:50:52.349 region:rollup2
START TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S

00:50:50.748 --> 00:50:54.018 region:rollup2
CONSIDERED ACCEPTABLE AND WHAT'S

00:50:52.349 --> 00:50:55.686 region:rollup2
OT BECAUSE THAT SEEMS TO BE A

00:50:54.018 --> 00:50:57.187 region:rollup2
MOVING TARGET RIGHT NOW.

00:50:55.686 --> 00:50:58.989 region:rollup2
THAT'S NUMBER ONE AND NUMBER TWO

00:50:57.187 --> 00:50:59.890 region:rollup2
HOW DO WE BALANCE.

00:50:58.989 --> 00:51:00.758 region:rollup2
HAVING A PLACE WHERE PEOPLE

00:50:59.890 --> 00:51:02.426 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE

00:51:00.758 --> 00:51:04.895 region:rollup2
PENALTIES FOR ACTING

00:51:02.426 --> 00:51:06.664 region:rollup2
INAPPROPRIATELY BUT ALSO WITH

00:51:04.895 --> 00:51:09.733 region:rollup2
THEY'RE NOT AFRAID ABOUT ALL OF

00:51:06.664 --> 00:51:11.802 region:rollup2
THEIR BEHAVIORS.

00:51:09.733 --> 00:51:13.370 region:rollup2
WELL I I THINK TOLERANCE

00:51:11.802 --> 00:51:16.240 region:rollup2
POLICIES DON'T MEAN THAT THE

00:51:13.370 --> 00:51:16.573 region:rollup2
REMEDY IS ALWAYS EXPULSION AND I

00:51:16.240 --> 00:51:17.908 region:rollup2
THINK FRANKLY.

00:51:16.573 --> 00:51:19.443 region:rollup2
.

00:51:17.908 --> 00:51:20.945 region:rollup2
WHAT TO DO IN THIS PARTICULAR

00:51:19.443 --> 00:51:22.212 region:rollup2
WORKPLACE BECAUSE YOU'RE ELECTED

00:51:20.945 --> 00:51:23.881 region:rollup2
OFFICIALS THAT BECOMES EVEN MORE

00:51:22.212 --> 00:51:25.983 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT RIGHT?

00:51:23.881 --> 00:51:28.052 region:rollup2
THIS ISN'T A NORMAL WORKPLACE

00:51:25.983 --> 00:51:29.853 region:rollup2
WHERE YOU HAVE YOU YOU COULD BE

00:51:28.052 --> 00:51:31.522 region:rollup2
FIRED AND YOU'RE OUT TO TOUR SO

00:51:29.853 --> 00:51:33.691 region:rollup2
I THINK. I'M.

00:51:31.522 --> 00:51:35.526 region:rollup2
IN ANY WORKPLACE HOWEVER ZERO

00:51:33.691 --> 00:51:36.994 region:rollup2
TOLERANCE DOES NOT MEAN NIGHT

00:51:35.526 --> 00:51:39.163 region:rollup2
IT'S A PREDETERMINED REMEDY BY

00:51:36.994 --> 00:51:41.565 region:rollup2
E. THERE COULD BE TRAINING THERE

00:51:39.163 --> 00:51:42.967 region:rollup2
COULD BE. I'M SOMEWHAT LOWER

00:51:41.565 --> 00:51:45.002 region:rollup2
FORM OF DISCIPLINE PART OF

00:51:42.967 --> 00:51:46.971 region:rollup2
EXPULSION SO I THINK THOSE ARE

00:51:45.002 --> 00:51:49.006 region:rollup2
TWO SEPARATE CONV CONV STRIKES

00:51:46.971 --> 00:51:50.140 region:rollup2
ONE IS. THIS IS NOT THE KIND OF

00:51:49.006 --> 00:51:51.742 region:rollup2
WORKPLACE WHO WANT TO HAVE WE'RE

00:51:50.140 --> 00:51:54.345 region:rollup2
GONNA HAVE ZERO TOLERANCE. FOR

00:51:51.742 --> 00:51:55.679 region:rollup2
HARASSING DISCRIMINATORY CONDUCT

00:51:54.345 --> 00:51:57.481 region:rollup2
AND RETALIATORY CONDUCT IN THE

00:51:55.679 --> 00:52:00.451 region:rollup2
WORKPLACE WHICH IS AT THE FAR

00:51:57.481 --> 00:52:02.486 region:rollup2
SPECTRUM. OF EMPLOYMENT ACTIONS

00:52:00.451 --> 00:52:04.588 region:rollup2
THE VAST MAJORITY OF DATING OUR

00:52:02.486 --> 00:52:06.991 region:rollup2
ACTIONS ARE NOT HARASSING

00:52:04.588 --> 00:52:09.626 region:rollup2
DISCRIMINATORY. OR RETALIATORY

00:52:06.991 --> 00:52:11.295 region:rollup2
IN THE WORKPLACE I THINK BUT THE

00:52:09.626 --> 00:52:12.930 region:rollup2
IDEA THAT THERE ARE SOME SORT OF

00:52:11.295 --> 00:52:15.499 region:rollup2
OVER CORRECTION IS ACTUALLY NOT

00:52:12.930 --> 00:52:16.934 region:rollup2
TRUE AT ALL WHAT THE CONDUCT

00:52:15.499 --> 00:52:19.470 region:rollup2
THAT'S COME OUT IF THEY COME

00:52:16.934 --> 00:52:19.937 region:rollup2
HERE AT THE CAPITOL I THINK WE

00:52:19.470 --> 00:52:21.138 region:rollup2
CAN ALL AGREE THAT THE

00:52:19.937 --> 00:52:21.705 region:rollup2
ALLEGATION.

00:52:21.138 --> 00:52:23.307 region:rollup2
OF COURSE HE SENT UP AND

00:52:21.705 --> 00:52:24.842 region:rollup2
DETERMINED YET SO ALL OCCUPANT

00:52:23.307 --> 00:52:26.377 region:rollup2
ALLEGATIONS ARE AGREE JUST

00:52:24.842 --> 00:52:28.412 region:rollup2
CONDUCT THAN ANYONE COULD COULD

00:52:26.377 --> 00:52:29.813 region:rollup2
DETERMINE THAT YOU DON'T DO

00:52:28.412 --> 00:52:31.815 region:rollup2
THOSE THINGS IN THE WORKPLACE.

00:52:29.813 --> 00:52:34.151 region:rollup2
THIS IS NOT THE THINGS THAT ARE

00:52:31.815 --> 00:52:34.351 region:rollup2
COMING OUT ARE NOT. I AM I HAVE

00:52:34.151 --> 00:52:36.754 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:52:34.351 --> 00:52:37.788 region:rollup2
.

00:52:36.754 --> 00:52:38.322 region:rollup2
TAKING YOU TO LUNCH AND WERE

00:52:37.788 --> 00:52:40.557 region:rollup2
HAVING A NICE CONVERSATION

00:52:38.322 --> 00:52:41.759 region:rollup2
ABOUT.

00:52:40.557 --> 00:52:43.560 region:rollup2
MY CHILDREN OR SOMETHING WE CAN

00:52:41.759 --> 00:52:44.962 region:rollup2
COUNT ON THE COULD THE CONTACT

00:52:43.560 --> 00:52:46.397 region:rollup2
THAT'S COMING OUT IS VASTLY

00:52:44.962 --> 00:52:48.232 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT THAN NOT IN IS VERY

00:52:46.397 --> 00:52:50.501 region:rollup2
STE SEXUAL IN NATURE. AND ARE

00:52:48.232 --> 00:52:51.902 region:rollup2
EXPLICITLY RETALIATORY SO I

00:52:50.501 --> 00:52:52.936 region:rollup2
THINK THAT LOOKING AT THE

00:52:51.902 --> 00:52:55.406 region:rollup2
CONDUCT THAT'S ALLEGED.

00:52:52.936 --> 00:52:56.707 region:rollup2
THIS ISN'T RUN OF THE MILL

00:52:55.406 --> 00:52:59.977 region:rollup2
CONDUCT IN THE WORKPLACE.

00:52:56.707 --> 00:53:02.146 region:rollup2
SO I WOULD BE WARY OF ANY SORT

00:52:59.977 --> 00:53:03.547 region:rollup2
OF INTERNALIZATION OF AN OVER

00:53:02.146 --> 00:53:05.649 region:rollup2
CORRECTION OR THAT.

00:53:03.547 --> 00:53:06.550 region:rollup2
BEING OVERLY PC IN THE

00:53:05.649 --> 00:53:07.851 region:rollup2
WORKPLACE I THINK THAT'S

00:53:06.550 --> 00:53:09.253 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY NOT HAPPENING AT ALL I

00:53:07.851 --> 00:53:11.121 region:rollup2
THINK WHAT YOU HAVE IS AT THE

00:53:09.253 --> 00:53:13.223 region:rollup2
OPPOSITE SPECTRUM THAT YOU HAVE.

00:53:11.121 --> 00:53:14.358 region:rollup2
THE HISTORIC.

00:53:13.223 --> 00:53:15.793 region:rollup2
STARKLY YOU HAVE A WORKPLACE

00:53:14.358 --> 00:53:16.593 region:rollup2
IT'S AFRAID TO COME FORWARD.

00:53:15.793 --> 00:53:17.995 region:rollup2
AND SO WHAT YOU HAVE IS A

00:53:16.593 --> 00:53:19.630 region:rollup2
BOTTLENECK.

00:53:17.995 --> 00:53:21.932 region:rollup2
AND SO WOMEN AND MEN ARE COMING

00:53:19.630 --> 00:53:23.600 region:rollup2
FORWARD WITH EGREGIOUS CONDUCT

00:53:21.932 --> 00:53:25.235 region:rollup2
THAT HAS JUST FRANKLY NOT.

00:53:23.600 --> 00:53:26.370 region:rollup2
BEEN BROUGHT TO THE FORE

00:53:25.235 --> 00:53:28.005 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THERE WASN'T A SAFE

00:53:26.370 --> 00:53:29.840 region:rollup2
SPACE FOR IT THAT WASN'T CLEAR

00:53:28.005 --> 00:53:31.842 region:rollup2
POLICIES AND PROCEDURES. AND

00:53:29.840 --> 00:53:33.377 region:rollup2
THERE WAS CERTAINLY CONCERNS

00:53:31.842 --> 00:53:35.045 region:rollup2
REGARDING BACKLASH I MEAN

00:53:33.377 --> 00:53:35.579 region:rollup2
THERE'S A REASON WHY OVER A

00:53:35.045 --> 00:53:36.447 region:rollup2
HUNDRED AND FIFTY WOMEN'S

00:53:35.579 --> 00:53:37.981 region:rollup2
SIGNED.

00:53:36.447 --> 00:53:39.516 region:rollup2
A LETTER SAYING THEY'VE BEEN

00:53:37.981 --> 00:53:41.485 region:rollup2
SUBJECTED TO SEXUAL HARASSMENT

00:53:39.516 --> 00:53:43.587 region:rollup2
OR INAPPROPRIATE CONDUCT OF AN

00:53:41.485 --> 00:53:44.621 region:rollup2
AGREED JUST NATURE.* THAT

00:53:43.587 --> 00:53:46.123 region:rollup2
DIDN'T HAPPEN BY ACCIDENT AND

00:53:44.621 --> 00:53:46.824 region:rollup2
THOSE AREN'T RUN OF THE MILL

00:53:46.123 --> 00:53:49.226 region:rollup2
EMPLOYMENT.

00:53:46.824 --> 00:53:51.228 region:rollup2
DISCUSSIONS.

00:53:49.226 --> 00:53:51.795 region:rollup2
SO I THINK WE NEED TO LOOK AT.

00:53:51.228 --> 00:53:54.098 region:rollup2
THE ZERO TOLERANCE DOES NOT

00:53:51.795 --> 00:53:56.266 region:rollup2
MEAN.

00:53:54.098 --> 00:53:58.335 region:rollup2
YOUR PRE JUDGING.

00:53:56.266 --> 00:54:00.637 region:rollup2
WHAT YOU'RE GONNA DO ABOUT IT?

00:53:58.335 --> 00:54:03.173 region:rollup2
IF I YOU NEED TO TAKE THAT ON A

00:54:00.637 --> 00:54:05.409 region:rollup2
CASE BY CASE BASIS AND I AGREE

00:54:03.173 --> 00:54:07.010 region:rollup2
UNDER THE LOT DOES SAY. THAT YOU

00:54:05.409 --> 00:54:10.047 region:rollup2
LOOK AT WHAT THE CONDUCT IS AS

00:54:07.010 --> 00:54:10.981 region:rollup2
TO WHAT THE REMEDY OUGHT TO BE.

00:54:10.047 --> 00:54:12.015 region:rollup2
THAT'S CONSISTENT WITH THE LINE

00:54:10.981 --> 00:54:13.650 region:rollup2
I DON'T THINK THAT'S AN

00:54:12.015 --> 00:54:15.319 region:rollup2
INCONSISTENT WITH. OTHER

00:54:13.650 --> 00:54:18.956 region:rollup2
POLICIES ARE THE POLICIES ARE

00:54:15.319 --> 00:54:20.491 region:rollup2
GOING WITH THIS BODY.

00:54:18.956 --> 00:54:22.626 region:rollup2
YOUR QUESTION I THINK.

00:54:20.491 --> 00:54:24.962 region:rollup2
IS FAIR AND I DON'T THINK IT'S

00:54:22.626 --> 00:54:26.730 region:rollup2
UNIQUE TO THIS BODY ACTUALLY I

00:54:24.962 --> 00:54:28.132 region:rollup2
WAS ATTENDING A LEGAL CONFERENCE

00:54:26.730 --> 00:54:29.500 region:rollup2
IN SAN FRANCISCO LAST WEEK THE

00:54:28.132 --> 00:54:31.268 region:rollup2
WOMEN LAWYERS TWENTY EIGHTEEN

00:54:29.500 --> 00:54:34.238 region:rollup2
CONFERENCE AND THIS EXACT ISSUE

00:54:31.268 --> 00:54:36.006 region:rollup2
CAME UP. WHERE THERE'S A SENSE

00:54:34.238 --> 00:54:38.075 region:rollup2
OF WALKING ON EGGSHELLS AT LEAST

00:54:36.006 --> 00:54:39.276 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHAT'S BEING DESCRIBED

00:54:38.075 --> 00:54:42.579 region:rollup2
AND THAT PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO

00:54:39.276 --> 00:54:44.715 region:rollup2
OVERCOMPENSATE IN A RATIONAL WAY

00:54:42.579 --> 00:54:47.117 region:rollup2
FOR EXAMPLE IN A LAW FIRM WHERE

00:54:44.715 --> 00:54:49.219 region:rollup2
A? MALE PARTNER HAS A NUMBER OF

00:54:47.117 --> 00:54:51.221 region:rollup2
ASSOCIATES ON HIS TEAM AND IF

00:54:49.219 --> 00:54:53.257 region:rollup2
THE CASE REQUIRES THAT.

00:54:51.221 --> 00:54:54.825 region:rollup2
THERE BE TRAVEL AT A TOWN

00:54:53.257 --> 00:54:57.494 region:rollup2
HE IS NOT GOING TO INVITE THE

00:54:54.825 --> 00:54:58.962 region:rollup2
FEMALE ASSOCIATE TO ACCOMPANY

00:54:57.494 --> 00:54:59.863 region:rollup2
HIM BECAUSE HE'S JUST NOT EVEN

00:54:58.962 --> 00:55:01.932 region:rollup2
GONNA PUT HIMSELF IN THAT

00:54:59.863 --> 00:55:04.067 region:rollup2
SITUATION FOR FEAR OF SOME FALSE

00:55:01.932 --> 00:55:06.236 region:rollup2
REPORT.

00:55:04.067 --> 00:55:06.803 region:rollup2
UNFORTUNATELY I DON'T THINK THAT

00:55:06.236 --> 00:55:09.406 region:rollup2
THAT'S.

00:55:06.803 --> 00:55:11.775 region:rollup2
AFFAIR REACTION I THINK ALL OF

00:55:09.406 --> 00:55:14.611 region:rollup2
US NO WERE ALL ADULTS AS TO WHAT

00:55:11.775 --> 00:55:16.980 region:rollup2
OUR CONDUCT AND NEEDS TO BE THE

00:55:14.611 --> 00:55:19.216 region:rollup2
LAW REQUIRES THAT WE SELF CENSOR

00:55:16.980 --> 00:55:21.084 region:rollup2
BEFORE WE SAY AND DO THINGS

00:55:19.216 --> 00:55:24.254 region:rollup2
RIGHT OUR INTENT DOESN'T MATTER

00:55:21.084 --> 00:55:25.856 region:rollup2
ARE THE IMPACT DOES. AND.

00:55:24.254 --> 00:55:27.991 region:rollup2
I THINK.

00:55:25.856 --> 00:55:30.460 region:rollup2
THIS OVER REACTION THIS FEAR

00:55:27.991 --> 00:55:31.395 region:rollup2
THAT YOU DESCRIBED AND WHAT

00:55:30.460 --> 00:55:33.297 region:rollup2
OTHER PEOPLE ARE DESCRIBING.

00:55:31.395 --> 00:55:34.832 region:rollup2
WILL.

00:55:33.297 --> 00:55:36.733 region:rollup2
FIND ITS WAY BACK.

00:55:34.832 --> 00:55:38.569 region:rollup2
TO SOME SENSE OF NORMALCY AT

00:55:36.733 --> 00:55:39.269 region:rollup2
SOME POINT BUT BECAUSE OF WHAT

00:55:38.569 --> 00:55:41.638 region:rollup2
WE'RE HEARING.

00:55:39.269 --> 00:55:44.775 region:rollup2
IN THE NEWS IN THE PRESS THESE

00:55:41.638 --> 00:55:46.843 region:rollup2
DAYS THAT IS A REACTION BUN

00:55:44.775 --> 00:55:48.478 region:rollup2
THERE'S NO LEGAL ANSWER TO THAT

00:55:46.843 --> 00:55:49.646 region:rollup2
THE STANDARDS HAVE BEEN IN PLACE

00:55:48.478 --> 00:55:51.648 region:rollup2
THE STANDARDS ARE GOING TO

00:55:49.646 --> 00:55:54.618 region:rollup2
REMAIN THE SAME AND EVERYBODY

00:55:51.648 --> 00:55:58.322 region:rollup2
HAS TO BE HELD THEM.

00:55:54.618 --> 00:55:58.722 region:rollup2
IN THIS.

00:55:58.322 --> 00:56:00.791 region:rollup2
BUT IF I MAY ADD.

00:55:58.722 --> 00:56:01.825 region:rollup2
.

00:56:00.791 --> 00:56:02.926 region:rollup2
THIS IS SOMETHING WORTH THINKING

00:56:01.825 --> 00:56:05.262 region:rollup2
ABOUT ALLIES.

00:56:02.926 --> 00:56:07.264 region:rollup2
IT HERE AS YOU RECOGNIZE A

00:56:05.262 --> 00:56:09.333 region:rollup2
MEDIA ATTENTION HAS BEEN FOCUSED

A LOT ON THE MOST EGREGIOUS

00:56:09.333 --> 00:56:11.969 region:rollup2

CRIMINAL JUSTICE TYPE RESPONSES

00:56:14.204 --> 00:56:17.007 region:rollup2

CONVERSATION.

00:56:17.007 --> 00:56:21.311 region:rollup2
AND. YOU KNOW SEXUAL HARASSMENT

00:56:19.243 --> 00:56:23.747 region:rollup2

00:56:52.242 --> 00:57:03.420 region:rollup2
AND THE TYPE OF RESPONSES AND

00:56:59.783 --> 00:57:05.122 region:rollup2
THAT THAT MY.

00:57:03.420 --> 00:57:06.890 region:rollup2
THE APPROPRIATE EACH EACH

00:57:05.122 --> 00:57:09.760 region:rollup2
CIRCUMSTANCE I THINK ASPECT OF

00:57:06.890 --> 00:57:11.895 region:rollup2
TRAINS DR CRESSMAN TRAINS WILL.

00:57:09.760 --> 00:57:12.696 region:rollup2
GO THROUGH THAT.

00:57:11.895 --> 00:57:13.196 region:rollup2
AND AND LAY THAT OUT AND ARE

00:57:12.696 --> 00:57:14.264 region:rollup2

STOP AND THERE ARE.

00:57:31.281 --> 00:57:36.687 region:rollup2
A WHOLE RANGE OF LEVELS OF

00:57:32.382 --> 00:57:38.722 region:rollup2
RESPONSES TO THAT.

00:57:36.687 --> 00:57:40.157 region:rollup2
SO I THINK WE HAVE A

00:57:38.722 --> 00:57:43.026 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBLY TO NUANCE THAT

00:57:40.157 --> 00:57:48.231 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION. AROUND SEXUAL

00:57:43.026 --> 00:57:49.566 region:rollup2
HARASSMENT AND IT WILL HELP UP

BACK TO.

00:57:57.040 --> 00:58:00.177 region:rollup2
A COMFORTABLE PLACE.

00:57:58.709 --> 00:58:01.278 region:rollup2
Q. HOW DO YOU BALANCE THE.

00:58:00.177 --> 00:58:02.279 region:rollup2
THE PUBLIC BENEFIT AND

00:58:01.278 --> 00:58:03.080 region:rollup2
EXPECTATION OF TRANSPARENCY%

00:58:02.279 --> 00:58:05.015 region:rollup2
AGAINST CONFIDENTIALITY.

00:58:03.080 --> 00:58:06.783 region:rollup2
PARTICULARLY WHEN IT COMES TO

00:58:05.015 --> 00:58:07.417 region:rollup2
AYE TALKING ABOUT. THUMB

00:58:06.783 --> 00:58:10.620 region:rollup2
RELEASING DATE LEGAL STANDARD OF

00:58:07.417 --> 00:58:13.123 region:rollup2
HOW THAT'S

00:58:10.620 --> 00:58:13.724 region:rollup2
DONE OR HOW YOU JUDGE THAT.

00:58:13.123 --> 00:58:16.393 region:rollup2
AND IN ADDITION ON HOW SHOULD

00:58:13.724 --> 00:58:18.095 region:rollup2
WE.

00:58:16.393 --> 00:58:19.463 region:rollup2
ALSO CONSIDER RELEASING

00:58:18.095 --> 00:58:21.498 region:rollup2
INFORMATION ABOUT MEMBER

00:58:19.463 --> 00:58:23.100 region:rollup2
TRANSGRESSIONS WHEN THERE IS

00:58:21.498 --> 00:58:26.670 region:rollup2
THAT CONTINUUM OF OFFENSE

00:58:23.100 --> 00:58:28.572 region:rollup2
SO. IS THE EXPECTATION THAT.

00:58:26.670 --> 00:58:30.140 region:rollup2
WITH A MEMBER LET'S SAY. ARM OF

00:58:28.572 --> 00:58:31.808 region:rollup2
THAT YOU WOULD RELEASE ANYTHING

00:58:30.140 --> 00:58:32.843 region:rollup2
THAT VIOLATES OUR POLICY TO THE

00:58:31.808 --> 00:58:35.012 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW TO THE PROCESS OF THE

00:58:32.843 --> 00:58:36.780 region:rollup2
PUBLIC OR ONLY THOSE EGREGIOUS

00:58:35.012 --> 00:58:37.414 region:rollup2
CASES I MEAN HOW WHAT WOULD HOW

00:58:36.780 --> 00:58:40.417 region:rollup2
WOULD YOU ADVISE US AS WE CRY.

00:58:37.414 --> 00:58:41.985 region:rollup2
IT'S POLICY.

00:58:40.417 --> 00:58:43.320 region:rollup2
SELF.

00:58:41.985 --> 00:58:44.021 region:rollup2
I THINK THIS IS A UNIQUE BODY

00:58:43.320 --> 00:58:46.323 region:rollup2
THEN YOU'RE ALL ELECTED

00:58:44.021 --> 00:58:48.992 region:rollup2
OFFICIALS. AND THE PERSON WHO

00:58:46.323 --> 00:58:49.793 region:rollup2
YOU RESPOND TO IT.

00:58:48.992 --> 00:58:50.894 region:rollup2
THAT'S NOT IN A PRIVATE

00:58:49.793 --> 00:58:52.963 region:rollup2
CORPORATION

00:58:50.894 --> 00:58:54.765 region:rollup2
SOME THERE ARE DIFFERENT.

00:58:52.963 --> 00:58:56.099 region:rollup2
INTERESTS HERE MY ANSWER MIGHT

00:58:54.765 --> 00:58:56.733 region:rollup2
BE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT FOR

00:58:56.099 --> 00:58:57.768 region:rollup2
PRIVATE CORPORATION AND IT WOULD

00:58:56.733 --> 00:58:59.903 region:rollup2
BE FOR THIS

00:58:57.768 --> 00:59:02.205 region:rollup2
A KILLER BODY WHERE WHAT YOU'RE

00:58:59.903 --> 00:59:03.774 region:rollup2
DOING IS FOR THE PEOPLE. AND THE

00:59:02.205 --> 00:59:05.275 region:rollup2
ACTIONS THAT YOU TAKE ARE

00:59:03.774 --> 00:59:06.810 region:rollup2
SUPPOSED TO BE UNDER THE

00:59:05.275 --> 00:59:08.111 region:rollup2
SUNSHINE LAWS IN THE LIGHT OF

00:59:06.810 --> 00:59:10.714 region:rollup2
DAY I ALSO THINK.

00:59:08.111 --> 00:59:12.182 region:rollup2
WHERE YOU DO HAVE SUCH A GRAVE

00:59:10.714 --> 00:59:13.583 region:rollup2
POWER DIFFERENTIAL

00:59:12.182 --> 00:59:15.519 region:rollup2
THAT THAT NEEDS TO BE TAKEN INTO

00:59:13.583 --> 00:59:18.622 region:rollup2
ACCOUNT? AND ONE OF THE BEST

00:59:15.519 --> 00:59:19.089 region:rollup2
THINGS. THAT WE'VE SEEN.

00:59:18.622 --> 00:59:21.491 region:rollup2
TO ADDRESS THAT POWER

00:59:19.089 --> 00:59:22.726 region:rollup2
DIFFERENTIAL. IS SUNSHINE LOOK

00:59:21.491 --> 00:59:25.128 region:rollup2
AT THE ONE SEEN MANNER.

00:59:22.726 --> 00:59:27.230 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW IT BECAUSE OF THAT

00:59:25.128 --> 00:59:29.266 region:rollup2
GREAT POWER DIFFERENTIAL IN THAT

00:59:27.230 --> 00:59:31.334 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR INDUSTRY IN FOR THAT

00:59:29.266 --> 00:59:32.803 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR INDIVIDUAL. THOSE

00:59:31.334 --> 00:59:34.204 region:rollup2
ABUSES WERE ALLOWED TO GO ON FOR

00:59:32.803 --> 00:59:35.372 region:rollup2
FAR LONGER THAN THEY EVER

00:59:34.204 --> 00:59:36.840 region:rollup2
SHOULDN'T.

00:59:35.372 --> 00:59:39.976 region:rollup2
THE SAME SORT OF CONSIDERATIONS

00:59:36.840 --> 00:59:42.112 region:rollup2
MUST BE CONSIDERED HERE.

00:59:39.976 --> 00:59:43.513 region:rollup2
PARTICULARLY AS IT RELATES TO IF

00:59:42.112 --> 00:59:45.782 region:rollup2
YOU FIND THAT THERE'S VIOLATIONS

00:59:43.513 --> 00:59:46.483 region:rollup2
A POLICY OR PROCEDURE OF COURSE

00:59:45.782 --> 00:59:48.285 region:rollup2
I DOUBT YOU'RE GOING TO BE

00:59:46.483 --> 00:59:49.753 region:rollup2
ADDRESSING WITH THOSE VIOLATIONS

00:59:48.285 --> 00:59:50.554 region:rollup2
OF LAW WITH YOUR INVESTIGATIONS.

00:59:49.753 --> 00:59:52.789 region:rollup2
ALTHOUGH THAT'S SOMETHING YOU

00:59:50.554 --> 00:59:53.557 region:rollup2
OUGHT TO CONSIDER ONE WAY OR THE

00:59:52.789 --> 00:59:56.393 region:rollup2
OTHER WHETHER YOU DOING.

00:59:53.557 --> 00:59:57.761 region:rollup2
BUT ASSUMING THAT THE WHAT THE

00:59:56.393 --> 00:59:59.296 region:rollup2
CONSTRUCT IS IS ARE VIOLATIONS

00:59:57.761 --> 01:00:01.698 region:rollup2
OF POLICIES OR PROCEDURES I

00:59:59.296 --> 01:00:02.599 region:rollup2
THINK. DESCRIBING WHAT THOSE ARE

01:00:01.698 --> 01:00:04.501 region:rollup2
I THINK.

01:00:02.599 --> 01:00:06.236 region:rollup2
PUTTING THAT INFORMATION OUT ON

01:00:04.501 --> 01:00:07.938 region:rollup2
THE PUBLIC IS NOT STUPID THEY

01:00:06.236 --> 01:00:09.039 region:rollup2
CAN EVALUATE THESE THINGS IF IT

01:00:07.938 --> 01:00:10.340 region:rollup2
WAS.

01:00:09.039 --> 01:00:13.410 region:rollup2
THE CONVERSATION.

01:00:10.340 --> 01:00:15.745 region:rollup2
ONE CONVERSATION ONE TIME WHICH

01:00:13.410 --> 01:00:18.715 region:rollup2
WAS NOT LADEN WITH PROFANITY AND

01:00:15.745 --> 01:00:20.183 region:rollup2
SEXUAL INNUENDO OR PUT PRO QUO

01:00:18.715 --> 01:00:22.319 region:rollup2
VERY DIFFERENT THAN A SEXUAL

01:00:20.183 --> 01:00:25.222 region:rollup2
ASSAULT. I THINK THE PUBLIC IS

01:00:22.319 --> 01:00:26.923 region:rollup2
ABLE TO EVALUATE THAT IN BECAUSE

01:00:25.222 --> 01:00:28.058 region:rollup2
THE RIGHT TO EVALUATE THAT.

01:00:26.923 --> 01:00:29.459 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO ULTIMATELY

01:00:28.058 --> 01:00:31.528 region:rollup2
DECIDE DO WE WANNA.

01:00:29.459 --> 01:00:33.130 region:rollup2
HOW THAT NUMBER COME BACK ARE

01:00:31.528 --> 01:00:34.030 region:rollup2
WE GONNA VOTE THEM BACK IN AND I

01:00:33.130 --> 01:00:35.999 region:rollup2
THINK WE'RE SEEING THAT ON A

01:00:34.030 --> 01:00:38.068 region:rollup2
NATIONAL SCALE AS WELL AS ON THE

01:00:35.999 --> 01:00:39.503 region:rollup2
STATE'S SCALE? IS THE PEOPLE DO

01:00:38.068 --> 01:00:40.770 region:rollup2
HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW WHICH IS A

01:00:39.503 --> 01:00:42.239 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT THAN A PRIVATE

01:00:40.770 --> 01:00:43.640 region:rollup2
CORPORATION.

01:00:42.239 --> 01:00:45.308 region:rollup2
WHERE I WOULD ARGUE THERE

01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:47.110 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE MORE TRANSPARENCY IN

01:00:45.308 --> 01:00:48.945 region:rollup2
MORE RECORD KEEPING AND THAT

01:00:47.110 --> 01:00:50.380 region:rollup2
THAT IS A MATTER PUBLIC POLICY

01:00:48.945 --> 01:00:54.151 region:rollup2
THAT SPOT TO?

01:00:50.380 --> 01:00:56.286 region:rollup2
OCCUR HOWEVER.

01:00:54.151 --> 01:00:58.355 region:rollup2
THERE IS A BATTLE A GREATER

01:00:56.286 --> 01:00:59.689 region:rollup2
BALANCING OF THE RIGHT TO

01:00:58.355 --> 01:01:00.690 region:rollup2
PRIVACY.

01:00:59.689 --> 01:01:03.727 region:rollup2
IN PERSONNEL RECORDS

01:01:00.690 --> 01:01:04.361 region:rollup2
PARTICULARLY WHEN IT COMES TO.

01:01:03.727 --> 01:01:05.529 region:rollup2
PRIVATE EMPLOYER AS OPPOSED TO

01:01:04.361 --> 01:01:05.862 region:rollup2
THIS BODY.

01:01:05.529 --> 01:01:09.132 region:rollup2
I DO THINK.

01:01:05.862 --> 01:01:11.468 region:rollup2
CONCERNS ABOUT.

01:01:09.132 --> 01:01:13.270 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS COMING FORWARD THERE

01:01:11.468 --> 01:01:15.038 region:rollup2
IS A GREAT DEAL OF FEAR ABOUT

01:01:13.270 --> 01:01:18.408 region:rollup2
RETALIATION AND IT'S REAL.

01:01:15.038 --> 01:01:20.644 region:rollup2
AND THE IDEA OF BLACKLISTING IS

01:01:18.408 --> 01:01:24.247 region:rollup2
QUITE REAL.

01:01:20.644 --> 01:01:24.881 region:rollup2
WHERE INDIVIDUALS FEEL THAT? IF

01:01:24.247 --> 01:01:25.949 region:rollup2
THEY COME FORWARD THEY MIGHT NOT

01:01:24.881 --> 01:01:26.950 region:rollup2
GET A JOB.

01:01:25.949 --> 01:01:28.685 region:rollup2
IN THE CITY OR ARE IN THIS

01:01:26.950 --> 01:01:30.520 region:rollup2
BUILDING.

01:01:28.685 --> 01:01:32.422 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THAT ALSO HAS TO BE

01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:33.857 region:rollup2
TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT WITH THE

01:01:32.422 --> 01:01:36.193 region:rollup2
CULTURE CHANGE IN THE POLICY

01:01:33.857 --> 01:01:38.328 region:rollup2
PROCEDURE. AGAIN INVESTIGATORY

01:01:36.193 --> 01:01:40.163 region:rollup2
CHANGES BECAUSE IF I'M

01:01:38.328 --> 01:01:40.730 region:rollup2
CONSIDERING COMING FORWARD I

01:01:40.163 --> 01:01:42.098 region:rollup2
NEED TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO

01:01:40.730 --> 01:01:44.668 region:rollup2
HAPPEN TO ME.

01:01:42.098 --> 01:01:46.002 region:rollup2
AND WHERE MY DATA GOES SO IN

01:01:44.668 --> 01:01:46.803 region:rollup2
ORDER TO ALLOW THAT INDIVIDUAL

01:01:46.002 --> 01:01:48.672 region:rollup2
TO MAKE THAT.

01:01:46.803 --> 01:01:50.674 region:rollup2
DECISION.

01:01:48.672 --> 01:01:52.275 region:rollup2
ABOUT WHAT THE CONSEQUENCES

01:01:50.674 --> 01:01:53.209 region:rollup2
WOULD BE FOR THAT INDIVIDUAL TO

01:01:52.275 --> 01:01:54.110 region:rollup2
COME FORWARD YOU WANT AN

01:01:53.209 --> 01:01:55.478 region:rollup2
ATMOSPHERE WHERE THEY FEEL

01:01:54.110 --> 01:01:56.680 region:rollup2
COMFORTABLE.

01:01:55.478 --> 01:01:57.213 region:rollup2
PART OF FEELING COMFORTABLE AS

01:01:56.680 --> 01:01:59.282 region:rollup2
IF THEY COME FORWARD THAT

01:01:57.213 --> 01:02:00.417 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY SOMETHING HOW.

01:01:59.282 --> 01:02:02.052 region:rollup2
THAT THEY'RE NOT MAKING A

01:02:00.417 --> 01:02:03.520 region:rollup2
COMPLAINT AND THEN THERE'S NO

01:02:02.052 --> 01:02:04.988 region:rollup2
ACTION THERE'S NO INVESTIGATION

01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:06.823 region:rollup2
AND THEY HERE TWO YEARS LATER.

01:02:04.988 --> 01:02:08.258 region:rollup2
THE SAME THING HAPPENED TO

01:02:06.823 --> 01:02:10.427 region:rollup2
ANOTHER WOMAN OR ANOTHER MAN.

01:02:08.258 --> 01:02:12.929 region:rollup2
SO PART OF THE CONSIDERATION IS

01:02:10.427 --> 01:02:14.864 region:rollup2
NOT ONLY CONCERN OF THE

01:02:12.929 --> 01:02:16.833 region:rollup2
IMMEDIATE DISCOMFORT OF THAT

01:02:14.864 --> 01:02:18.001 region:rollup2
PERSON WHO IS A WITNESS.

01:02:16.833 --> 01:02:19.035 region:rollup2
BUT ALSO IF THEY'RE COMING

01:02:18.001 --> 01:02:21.605 region:rollup2
FORWARD THAT IS GOING TO BE

01:02:19.035 --> 01:02:23.306 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVE NOBODY JUST LIKE IF

01:02:21.605 --> 01:02:24.808 region:rollup2
YOU'RE BRING UP SAFETY ISSUES.

01:02:23.306 --> 01:02:26.576 region:rollup2
WANNA MAKE SURE THAT'S FIXED

01:02:24.808 --> 01:02:28.712 region:rollup2
SO THAT OTHER PEOPLE DON'T END

01:02:26.576 --> 01:02:30.614 region:rollup2
UP BEEN THE SAME PROBLEM IF YOU

01:02:28.712 --> 01:02:31.381 region:rollup2
HAVE SOMEONE WHO SEXUALLY

01:02:30.614 --> 01:02:33.350 region:rollup2
ASSAULTS AND.

01:02:31.381 --> 01:02:34.884 region:rollup2
THE WORST CASE SCENARIO AND YOU

01:02:33.350 --> 01:02:36.786 region:rollup2
MAKE A COMPLAINT.

01:02:34.884 --> 01:02:38.054 region:rollup2
YOUR EXPECTATION IS I MAKE THIS

01:02:36.786 --> 01:02:39.356 region:rollup2
COMPLAINT THOUGH SEXUAL ASSAULTS

01:02:38.054 --> 01:02:41.291 region:rollup2
STOP.

01:02:39.356 --> 01:02:43.526 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S PART OF WHAT THIS BODY

01:02:41.291 --> 01:02:44.127 region:rollup2
NEEDS TO CONSIDER AS IT BOUNCES

01:02:43.526 --> 01:02:48.298 region:rollup2
ISSUES OF TRANSPARENCY VERSUS

01:02:44.127 --> 01:02:49.232 region:rollup2
PRIVACY.

01:02:48.298 --> 01:02:50.066 region:rollup2
I'M NOT SURE I HAVE MUCH MORE TO

01:02:49.232 --> 01:02:52.068 region:rollup2
ADD EXCEPT I WOULD.

01:02:50.066 --> 01:02:53.837 region:rollup2
.

01:02:52.068 --> 01:02:56.072 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW ENCOURAGE THE

01:02:53.837 --> 01:02:58.541 region:rollup2
PROTECTION OF THE INTEGRITY OF

01:02:56.072 --> 01:03:00.877 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATIONS AS THEY.

01:02:58.541 --> 01:03:02.579 region:rollup2
ARE GOING ON I THINK IT'S VERY

01:03:00.877 --> 01:03:05.749 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT THAT AN INVESTIGATIVE

01:03:02.579 --> 01:03:07.984 region:rollup2
PROCESS HAVE INTEGRITY AND THAT.

01:03:05.749 --> 01:03:09.486 region:rollup2
WE REMEMBER THAT THEY ARE

01:03:07.984 --> 01:03:11.755 region:rollup2
ALLEGATIONS UNTIL THERE'S A

01:03:09.486 --> 01:03:13.623 region:rollup2
DETERMINATION MADE THAT UP BASED

01:03:11.755 --> 01:03:14.357 region:rollup2
ON THE APPROPRIATE A STANDARD OF

01:03:13.623 --> 01:03:16.660 region:rollup2
PROOF.

01:03:14.357 --> 01:03:19.329 region:rollup2
THAT IT DID OR DID NOT OCCUR

01:03:16.660 --> 01:03:21.064 region:rollup2
AND IF THERE IS GOING TO BE

01:03:19.329 --> 01:03:23.333 region:rollup2
DISCLOSURE IN PUBLICATION TO THE

01:03:21.064 --> 01:03:25.135 region:rollup2
PUBLIC AS THIS BODY I AM. IS

01:03:23.333 --> 01:03:26.569 region:rollup2
REQUIRED TO DO I THINK IT'S

01:03:25.135 --> 01:03:28.405 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT TO MAKE VERY CLEAR

01:03:26.569 --> 01:03:31.074 region:rollup2
WHETHER OR NOT SOMETHING WAS

01:03:28.405 --> 01:03:31.941 region:rollup2
SUBSTANTIATED OR UNSUBSTANTIATED

01:03:31.074 --> 01:03:34.477 region:rollup2
AFTER A FAIR.

01:03:31.941 --> 01:03:35.679 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATION.

01:03:34.477 --> 01:03:37.113 region:rollup2
IF YOU HAVE A COMMENT ABOUT

01:03:35.679 --> 01:03:39.382 region:rollup2
BEING ABLE TO PROTECT WITNESSES

01:03:37.113 --> 01:03:41.718 region:rollup2
AND AND VICTIMS CONFIDANTE

01:03:39.382 --> 01:03:43.486 region:rollup2
CONFIDENTIALITY VERSES SAW THAT.

01:03:41.718 --> 01:03:44.421 region:rollup2
DESIRE FOR TRANSPARENCY DO YOU

01:03:43.486 --> 01:03:46.156 region:rollup2
HAVE ANY.

01:03:44.421 --> 01:03:46.623 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE WITHOUT ERROR IS IS

01:03:46.156 --> 01:03:48.525 region:rollup2
THAT SOMETHING THAT.

01:03:46.623 --> 01:03:50.160 region:rollup2
HOW DO YOU TAKE THAT INTO

01:03:48.525 --> 01:03:53.430 region:rollup2
ACCOUNT?

01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:55.498 region:rollup2
I I THINK THIS IS A A KEY ISSUE.

01:03:53.430 --> 01:03:57.167 region:rollup2
SOME INDIVIDUALS AYE AYE

01:03:55.498 --> 01:03:58.968 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY REPRESENT INDIVIDUAL

01:03:57.167 --> 01:04:00.170 region:rollup2
SOME WHO WISH TO COME FORWARD.

01:03:58.968 --> 01:04:01.338 region:rollup2
AND ARE VERY HAPPY TO TALK TO

01:04:00.170 --> 01:04:02.906 region:rollup2
THE PRESS OR TO TALK

01:04:01.338 --> 01:04:04.407 region:rollup2
WHOEVER WOULD LIKE TO LISTEN

01:04:02.906 --> 01:04:06.042 region:rollup2
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED AND I HAVE

01:04:04.407 --> 01:04:07.343 region:rollup2
OTHERS. WHO REALLY WOULD RATHER

01:04:06.042 --> 01:04:09.112 region:rollup2
NOT?

01:04:07.343 --> 01:04:11.214 region:rollup2
AND SO I AM BECAUSE THEY'RE

01:04:09.112 --> 01:04:12.515 region:rollup2
AFRAID OF RETALIATION BECAUSE

01:04:11.214 --> 01:04:14.984 region:rollup2
THEY'D LIKE TO NOT THINK ABOUT

01:04:12.515 --> 01:04:17.420 region:rollup2
IT BECAUSE IT'S THEIR CHOICE.

01:04:14.984 --> 01:04:19.489 region:rollup2
AND SO I THINK THAT IS IT A

01:04:17.420 --> 01:04:22.058 region:rollup2
MAJOR ISSUE I DON'T THINK AT THE

01:04:19.489 --> 01:04:23.960 region:rollup2
POINT. IN INDIVIDUAL MAKES UP A

01:04:22.058 --> 01:04:25.762 region:rollup2
COMPLAINT. AND PROVIDES

01:04:23.960 --> 01:04:27.731 region:rollup2
DOCUMENTATION THAT THAT

01:04:25.762 --> 01:04:28.865 region:rollup2
IMMEDIATELY BAD BEFORE AN

01:04:27.731 --> 01:04:31.000 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATION NEEDS TO.

01:04:28.865 --> 01:04:33.069 region:rollup2
B. PUBLICIZED I THINK YOU HAVE

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:35.105 region:rollup2
TO HAVE A PROCESS FOR THAT.

01:04:33.069 --> 01:04:38.074 region:rollup2
ULTIMATELY HOWEVER I THINK THERE

01:04:35.105 --> 01:04:40.710 region:rollup2
HAS TO BE BY THE FINDINGS.

01:04:38.074 --> 01:04:42.846 region:rollup2
AND WHETHER THIS BODY HAD THE

01:04:40.710 --> 01:04:44.447 region:rollup2
CONSIDERS US SOME REDUCTIONS OF

01:04:42.846 --> 01:04:46.583 region:rollup2
THAT PARTICULAR WITNESS NAMES

01:04:44.447 --> 01:04:47.217 region:rollup2
ARE VICTIMS NAMES. THAT'S

01:04:46.583 --> 01:04:47.417 region:rollup2
SOMETHING YOU'D HAVE TO GRAPPLE

01:04:47.217 --> 01:04:49.085 region:rollup2
WITH.

01:04:47.417 --> 01:04:50.353 region:rollup2
.

01:04:49.085 --> 01:04:51.955 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I DO BELIEVE THAT THERE

01:04:50.353 --> 01:04:54.691 region:rollup2
IS.

01:04:51.955 --> 01:04:56.593 region:rollup2
REASONABLE POSITIONS ON BOTH

01:04:54.691 --> 01:04:59.262 region:rollup2
SIDES BUT I THINK.

01:04:56.593 --> 01:05:00.897 region:rollup2
PART OF WHY PEOPLE ARE AFRAID TO

01:04:59.262 --> 01:05:01.398 region:rollup2
HAVE THEIR NAME COME FORWARD IS

01:05:00.897 --> 01:05:03.566 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THE ADVERSE

01:05:01.398 --> 01:05:05.368 region:rollup2
CONSEQUENCES.

01:05:03.566 --> 01:05:07.737 region:rollup2
AND SO.

01:05:05.368 --> 01:05:10.673 region:rollup2
WE HAVE TO EXAMINE THAT AND BASS

01:05:07.737 --> 01:05:12.709 region:rollup2
IF THOSE ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES TO

01:05:10.673 --> 01:05:13.543 region:rollup2
THEM ARE HANDLED. WHERE THEY

01:05:12.709 --> 01:05:14.911 region:rollup2
FEEL THAT?

01:05:13.543 --> 01:05:17.514 region:rollup2
THEY'RE BEING HANDLED THEY'RE

01:05:14.911 --> 01:05:19.983 region:rollup2
MORE LIKELY TO TO.

01:05:17.514 --> 01:05:20.717 region:rollup2
BUT. NOT BE AS CONCERNED IF

01:05:19.983 --> 01:05:23.620 region:rollup2
THEIR NAME IS INCLUDED IN SOME

01:05:20.717 --> 01:05:24.754 region:rollup2
SORT OF.

01:05:23.620 --> 01:05:26.289 region:rollup2
BUT IF THEY FEEL THE REPORT GOES

01:05:24.754 --> 01:05:28.425 region:rollup2
NOWHERE AND THAT CONDUCT

01:05:26.289 --> 01:05:28.992 region:rollup2
CONTINUES THEN UNDERSTANDABLY

01:05:28.425 --> 01:05:32.629 region:rollup2
THEY'RE GONNA HAVE A GREATER

01:05:28.992 --> 01:05:34.864 region:rollup2
CONCERN.

01:05:32.629 --> 01:05:36.332 region:rollup2
VALLEY ON.

01:09:03.373 --> 01:09:06.642 region:rollup2
RIGHTS AND WE HAVE TO DISPLAY

01:09:04.874 --> 01:09:08.211 region:rollup2
THOSE RIGHTS TO THEM SO TEY

01:09:06.642 --> 01:09:09.612 region:rollup2
HAVE SOME POWER. WHEN THINGS ARE

01:09:08.211 --> 01:09:11.080 region:rollup2
NOT RIGHT.

01:09:09.612 --> 01:09:12.448 region:rollup2
OKAY IF I DO SOMETHING TO THEM

01:09:11.080 --> 01:09:14.117 region:rollup2
THAT'S NOT RIGHT LIKE NOT PAY

01:09:12.448 --> 01:09:15.485 region:rollup2
THEM RIGHT NOT DO ALL THAT

01:09:14.117 --> 01:09:17.654 region:rollup2
THERE'S A WHOLE HOST A LAWS THEY

01:09:15.485 --> 01:09:19.322 region:rollup2
HAVE POWER TO RETALIATE BACK. SO

01:09:17.654 --> 01:09:22.625 region:rollup2
THAT THEY'RE NOT INTO.

01:09:19.322 --> 01:09:23.559 region:rollup2
IN A SITUATION WHERE I HAVE MY.

01:09:22.625 --> 01:09:25.928 region:rollup2
TOO MUCH POWER OVER THEM THEY

01:09:23.559 --> 01:09:27.363 region:rollup2
HAVE THEIR BRIGHTS.

01:09:25.928 --> 01:09:28.931 region:rollup2
DO OUR EMPLOYEES IN THIS CAPITAL

01:09:27.363 --> 01:09:30.533 region:rollup2
HAVE THOSE SAME RIGHTS I DON'T

01:09:28.931 --> 01:09:32.335 region:rollup2
THINK SO BECAUSE WE DON'T ABIDE

01:09:30.533 --> 01:09:33.903 region:rollup2
BY SOME OF THE SAME RULES THAT I

01:09:32.335 --> 01:09:35.204 region:rollup2
HAVE TO IN MY PRIVATE WORLD. AND

01:09:33.903 --> 01:09:36.906 region:rollup2
THAT SETS UP A POWER STRUCTURE

01:09:35.204 --> 01:09:38.474 region:rollup2
WHERE YOU.

01:09:36.906 --> 01:09:40.276 region:rollup2
PUSHY TALKED ABOUT.

01:09:38.474 --> 01:09:42.645 region:rollup2
THE CASE WHERE YOUBECAUSE

01:09:40.276 --> 01:09:46.082 region:rollup2
YOU'RE OUT WILL YOU CAN BE.

01:09:42.645 --> 01:09:47.884 region:rollup2
FIRED WITHOUT CAUSE BASICALLY

01:09:46.082 --> 01:09:48.818 region:rollup2
EVEN IF THERE IS A THERE'S NO

01:09:47.884 --> 01:09:50.319 region:rollup2
ABILITY TO COME BACK SO I GUESS

01:09:48.818 --> 01:09:51.054 region:rollup2
THAT I'M TRYING TO.

01:09:50.319 --> 01:09:53.056 region:rollup2
BUT I'M TRYING TO DO IS FIGURE

01:09:51.054 --> 01:09:54.257 region:rollup2
OUT HOW WE GET OURSELVES IN A

01:09:53.056 --> 01:09:55.992 region:rollup2
POSITION WHERE.

01:09:54.257 --> 01:09:57.226 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WELL HOPEFULLY AFTER

01:09:55.992 --> 01:09:58.494 region:rollup2
ALL THIS COMES OUT WE'RE GONNA

01:09:57.226 --> 01:10:00.263 region:rollup2
PUT SOME POLICY IN PLACE THAT

01:09:58.494 --> 01:10:01.597 region:rollup2
WILL HELP.

01:10:00.263 --> 01:10:03.166 region:rollup2
THE PERSON WHO A DIP OR THE

01:10:01.597 --> 01:10:04.767 region:rollup2
PEOPLE ARE IN THAT HR DEPARTMENT

01:10:03.166 --> 01:10:05.234 region:rollup2
HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHERE THAT

01:10:04.767 --> 01:10:06.302 region:rollup2
WHERE WE GO FORWARD TO

01:10:05.234 --> 01:10:07.470 region:rollup2
REPRESENT.

01:10:06.302 --> 01:10:09.639 region:rollup2
BOTH THE EMPLOYER AND THE

01:10:07.470 --> 01:10:12.075 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEE.

01:10:09.639 --> 01:10:13.743 region:rollup2
UNLIKELY IN THIS AREA THAT THE

01:10:12.075 --> 01:10:14.510 region:rollup2
LAWS ARE THE SAME MEETING UNDER

01:10:13.743 --> 01:10:16.212 region:rollup2
THE FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING

01:10:14.510 --> 01:10:18.881 region:rollup2
ACT.

01:10:16.212 --> 01:10:20.349 region:rollup2
THAT THIS BODY IS COVERED.

01:10:18.881 --> 01:10:21.951 region:rollup2
SAME AS THEY ARE AT MY BUSINESS

01:10:20.349 --> 01:10:24.721 region:rollup2
OR YOUR BUSINESS.

01:10:21.951 --> 01:10:27.457 region:rollup2
AND SO THAT IS NOT AN ISSUE

01:10:24.721 --> 01:10:28.991 region:rollup2
THAT YOU HAVE TO. A. TACKLED

01:10:27.457 --> 01:10:30.927 region:rollup2
BECAUSE YOU'RE EXPRESS IT THAT

01:10:28.991 --> 01:10:32.095 region:rollup2
LEGISLATORS EXPRESSLY COVERED BY

01:10:30.927 --> 01:10:35.231 region:rollup2
THAT DIFFER EMPLOYMENT AND

01:10:32.095 --> 01:10:36.733 region:rollup2
HOUSING ACT WHICH COVERS.

01:10:35.231 --> 01:10:38.201 region:rollup2
HARASSMENT DISCRIMINATION AND

01:10:36.733 --> 01:10:39.735 region:rollup2
RETALIATION IN THE WORKPLACE THE

01:10:38.201 --> 01:10:41.704 region:rollup2
AT WILL DOCTRINE DOES NOT

01:10:39.735 --> 01:10:43.539 region:rollup2
OBVIATE THAT BECAUSE YOU CAN

01:10:41.704 --> 01:10:44.674 region:rollup2
HIRE OR FIRE SOMEBODY FOR GOOD

01:10:43.539 --> 01:10:46.175 region:rollup2
REASON OR NO REASON AT ALL AND

01:10:44.674 --> 01:10:47.944 region:rollup2
SO LONG AS.

01:10:46.175 --> 01:10:49.011 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT A DISCRIMINATORY REASON

01:10:47.944 --> 01:10:51.347 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT BECAUSE OF A PROTECTED

01:10:49.011 --> 01:10:52.982 region:rollup2
STATUS OR NOT BECAUSE OF A

01:10:51.347 --> 01:10:55.952 region:rollup2
VIOLATION OF STATE OR FEDERAL.

01:10:52.982 --> 01:10:58.187 region:rollup2
LAW OR POLICY REGULATION YOU CAN

01:10:55.952 --> 01:11:01.090 region:rollup2
SAY SAKE I SAY THAT A LOT TO

01:10:58.187 --> 01:11:02.892 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WHO CALL ME. SO. AS IT

01:11:01.090 --> 01:11:04.293 region:rollup2
RELATES TO THIS ISSUE.

01:11:02.892 --> 01:11:05.862 region:rollup2
OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT

01:11:04.293 --> 01:11:08.131 region:rollup2
DISCRIMINATION AND RETALIATION

01:11:05.862 --> 01:11:09.866 region:rollup2
THIS BODY IS COVERED IN LIKELY

01:11:08.131 --> 01:11:11.868 region:rollup2
YOU DON'T NEED TO ADDRESS THAT.

01:11:09.866 --> 01:11:13.436 region:rollup2
BOMB AT THIS JUNCTURE. I ALSO

01:11:11.868 --> 01:11:16.005 region:rollup2
WOULD HESITATE

01:11:13.436 --> 01:11:17.273 region:rollup2
TWO ABOVE ARGUE THAT ELEVEN NO

01:11:16.005 --> 01:11:18.741 region:rollup2
TWO POINT FIVE WHICH IS THE

01:11:17.273 --> 01:11:20.209 region:rollup2
WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTION ACT.

01:11:18.741 --> 01:11:21.978 region:rollup2
IS THAT THIS BODY IS NOT

01:11:20.209 --> 01:11:23.746 region:rollup2
COVERED NOW THERE'S NO APPELLATE

01:11:21.978 --> 01:11:24.847 region:rollup2
CASE WHICH SQUARELY ADDRESSES

01:11:23.746 --> 01:11:26.048 region:rollup2
THAT BUT I THINK THIS BODY

01:11:24.847 --> 01:11:27.784 region:rollup2
SHOULD.

01:11:26.048 --> 01:11:29.652 region:rollup2
ACT AS THOUGH AND WAIT FOR THE

01:11:27.784 --> 01:11:30.920 region:rollup2
APPELLATE COURTS TO MAKE THEIR

01:11:29.652 --> 01:11:32.155 region:rollup2
WAY THERE'S GONNA BE I'M SURE A

01:11:30.920 --> 01:11:33.523 region:rollup2
CASE AT SOME POINT WHICH

01:11:32.155 --> 01:11:34.690 region:rollup2
SQUARELY ADDRESSES THAT AS A

01:11:33.523 --> 01:11:37.160 region:rollup2
MATTER OF LAW.

01:11:34.690 --> 01:11:39.028 region:rollup2
AND THAT THE CURRENT

01:11:37.160 --> 01:11:40.830 region:rollup2
WHISTLEBLOWER LEGISLATION THAT

01:11:39.028 --> 01:11:42.865 region:rollup2
WAS JUST PASSED

01:11:40.830 --> 01:11:45.101 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE AUGMENTING ELEVEN A

01:11:42.865 --> 01:11:47.503 region:rollup2
TWO POINT FIVE AS OPPOSED TO.

01:11:45.101 --> 01:11:50.373 region:rollup2
IN PLACE OF ELEVEN NO TWO POINT

01:11:47.503 --> 01:11:52.341 region:rollup2
FIVE SO I WOULD ARGUE THAT THIS

01:11:50.373 --> 01:11:53.709 region:rollup2
BODY OUGHT TO CONSIDER ITSELF

01:11:52.341 --> 01:11:55.578 region:rollup2
COVERED UNDER THE WHISTLEBLOWER

01:11:53.709 --> 01:11:57.213 region:rollup2
PROTECTION ACT. PERHAPS YOU MAY

01:11:55.578 --> 01:11:59.282 region:rollup2
EVEN WISH TWO AND LEGISLATIVE

01:11:57.213 --> 01:12:00.783 region:rollup2
FINDINGS CLARIFY YES IN FACT WE

01:11:59.282 --> 01:12:02.718 region:rollup2
ARE AND THAT'S INDICATIVE OF

01:12:00.783 --> 01:12:04.420 region:rollup2
PRIOR LAW. AND IT SIMPLY

01:12:02.718 --> 01:12:06.022 region:rollup2
CLARIFYING YES.

01:12:04.420 --> 01:12:06.722 region:rollup2
THERE IS NO APPELLATE CASE LAW

01:12:06.022 --> 01:12:10.393 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:12:06.722 --> 01:12:11.861 region:rollup2
SO. I THINK AS IT SPECIFICALLY

01:12:10.393 --> 01:12:12.829 region:rollup2
RELATES TO WHAT WE'RE DEALING

01:12:11.861 --> 01:12:15.198 region:rollup2
WITH HERE WHICH.

01:12:12.829 --> 01:12:16.365 region:rollup2
ALSO IS ABOUT RETALIATION

01:12:15.198 --> 01:12:17.667 region:rollup2
WHISTLEBLOWING.

01:12:16.365 --> 01:12:18.267 region:rollup2
THAT THERE'S THE NEW

01:12:17.667 --> 01:12:19.902 region:rollup2
LEGISLATION AND I WOULD ARGUE

01:12:18.267 --> 01:12:21.704 region:rollup2
LEFT.

01:12:19.902 --> 01:12:24.841 region:rollup2
FIVE OR EIGHTY COVERS SAID.

01:12:21.704 --> 01:12:25.441 region:rollup2
BUT AGAIN WE'LL HAVE TO WAIT

01:12:24.841 --> 01:12:28.945 region:rollup2
FOR THE COURTS TO TO GIVE THE

01:12:25.441 --> 01:12:30.746 region:rollup2
FINAL WORD ON THAT.

01:12:28.945 --> 01:12:32.582 region:rollup2
I THINK TO TRULY BE HELPFUL IN

01:12:30.746 --> 01:12:35.585 region:rollup2
THIS PROCESS BOMB AS WE GATHER

01:12:32.582 --> 01:12:38.120 region:rollup2
INFORMATION AND DATA ABOUT HOW

01:12:35.585 --> 01:12:40.056 region:rollup2
TO CREATE A SYSTEM. THAT IS FAIR

01:12:38.120 --> 01:12:41.557 region:rollup2
AND YES IT WOULD BE NAIVE OF US

01:12:40.056 --> 01:12:43.125 region:rollup2
TO CONTINUE TO OPERATE UNDER THE

01:12:41.557 --> 01:12:45.328 region:rollup2
ASSUMPTION. THAT THE POWER

01:12:43.125 --> 01:12:46.896 region:rollup2
DYNAMIC IS YOU KNOW ALMOST A ONE

01:12:45.328 --> 01:12:48.698 region:rollup2
WAY STREET BETWEEN ELECTED

01:12:46.896 --> 01:12:50.499 region:rollup2
OFFICIALS AND STAFF IT IS MUCH

01:12:48.698 --> 01:12:51.634 region:rollup2
MORE COMPLEX THAN THAT. YOU'VE

01:12:50.499 --> 01:12:52.935 region:rollup2
REFERENCED THE HUNDRED FIFTY

01:12:51.634 --> 01:12:55.271 region:rollup2
WOMEN WHO SIGNED ONTO LETTERS

01:12:52.935 --> 01:12:57.406 region:rollup2
MANY OF THEM WERE WOMEN FROM

01:12:55.271 --> 01:12:59.675 region:rollup2
THIRD HOUSE WHO TALKED ABOUT THE

01:12:57.406 --> 01:13:01.611 region:rollup2
DYNAMIC OF. THIRD HOUSE POWER

01:12:59.675 --> 01:13:02.545 region:rollup2
BROKERS AND THEIR INFLUENCE ON

01:13:01.611 --> 01:13:05.147 region:rollup2
THIS BUILDING.

01:13:02.545 --> 01:13:06.549 region:rollup2
WE HAVE LEGISLATIVE COLLEAGUES

01:13:05.147 --> 01:13:08.584 region:rollup2
WHO FEEL THAT SOME OF THE

01:13:06.549 --> 01:13:09.085 region:rollup2
TENSION THAT'S BEEN BROUGHT TO

01:13:08.584 --> 01:13:11.954 region:rollup2
THEM IS AS A RESULT OF.

01:13:09.085 --> 01:13:15.157 region:rollup2
EXTERNAL.

01:13:11.954 --> 01:13:16.492 region:rollup2
BROKERS WHO HAVE A VESTED

01:13:15.157 --> 01:13:18.361 region:rollup2
INTEREST IN THE OUTCOME OF

01:13:16.492 --> 01:13:18.828 region:rollup2
POLICIES THAT THAT HAPPEN IN

01:13:18.361 --> 01:13:21.764 region:rollup2
THIS BUILDING.

01:13:18.828 --> 01:13:23.499 region:rollup2
INFLUENCING THE PROCESS AND SO

01:13:21.764 --> 01:13:26.168 region:rollup2
TO SIMPLY ASSUME THAT IT'S

01:13:23.499 --> 01:13:27.169 region:rollup2
LEGISLATORS AND STAFF. IT'S NOT

01:13:26.168 --> 01:13:29.805 region:rollup2
IT NOT EVEN IF IN THE END AND WE

01:13:27.169 --> 01:13:32.575 region:rollup2
CAN'T AFFORD THE FOCUS ON JUST

01:13:29.805 --> 01:13:33.776 region:rollup2
THAT RELATIONSHIP. IT'S MORE

01:13:32.575 --> 01:13:35.578 region:rollup2
BROUGHT ITS BROADER.

01:13:33.776 --> 01:13:36.913 region:rollup2
WHICH MAKES THIS PROCESS.

01:13:35.578 --> 01:13:39.115 region:rollup2
AND THE POLICIES WE HAVE TO COME

01:13:36.913 --> 01:13:40.983 region:rollup2
UP WITH MUCH MORE COMPLEX AND

01:13:39.115 --> 01:13:43.653 region:rollup2
AND AND LAYERED.

01:13:40.983 --> 01:13:46.522 region:rollup2
AND THE NOTION OF BIAS.

01:13:43.653 --> 01:13:48.591 region:rollup2
COMES INTO PLAY AS WELL.

01:13:46.522 --> 01:13:52.261 region:rollup2
GIVEN THAT COMPLEXITY.

01:13:48.591 --> 01:13:55.131 region:rollup2
BOMB WHAT CONCERNS ME IS.

01:13:52.261 --> 01:13:57.099 region:rollup2
.

01:13:55.131 --> 01:14:00.670 region:rollup2
THE TERMINOLOGY WE CONTINUE TO

01:13:57.099 --> 01:14:01.203 region:rollup2
USE THAT CAN BE INTERPRETED BY.

01:14:00.670 --> 01:14:02.805 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT PEOPLE SO MANY

01:14:01.203 --> 01:14:06.575 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT WAYS.

01:14:02.805 --> 01:14:08.210 region:rollup2
AND SO PERCEPTION OF BIAS ZERO

01:14:06.575 --> 01:14:10.980 region:rollup2
TOLERANCE ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEMS

01:14:08.210 --> 01:14:12.915 region:rollup2
TRANSPARENCY DUE PROCESS.

01:14:10.980 --> 01:14:14.950 region:rollup2
FIGURING OUT HOW WE.

01:14:12.915 --> 01:14:16.519 region:rollup2
DEVELOP A CULTURE.

01:14:14.950 --> 01:14:20.022 region:rollup2
WE'LL WE CAN COULD CLEARLY

01:14:16.519 --> 01:14:21.457 region:rollup2
DEFINE WHAT IS HARASSMENT.

01:14:20.022 --> 01:14:22.725 region:rollup2
AND WHAT THE POLICIES AND

01:14:21.457 --> 01:14:24.827 region:rollup2
PROCEDURES WILL BE TO ADDRESS IT

01:14:22.725 --> 01:14:26.195 region:rollup2
I THINK IS.

01:14:24.827 --> 01:14:28.564 region:rollup2
I HAVE TO BE AT THE TOP OF OUR

01:14:26.195 --> 01:14:30.733 region:rollup2
AGENDA AND SO EVERYONE HAS

01:14:28.564 --> 01:14:33.002 region:rollup2
CLARITY ABOUT THE PROCESS OF HOW

01:14:30.733 --> 01:14:34.537 region:rollup2
THEY CAN BE PROTECTED.

01:14:33.002 --> 01:14:36.172 region:rollup2
MY COLLEAGUE ASKED ONE QUESTION

01:14:34.537 --> 01:14:38.074 region:rollup2
TERMS OF BALANCE BUT I I'VE GOT

01:14:36.172 --> 01:14:40.476 region:rollup2
ANOTHER BASED ON JUST.

01:14:38.074 --> 01:14:42.178 region:rollup2
THE NEWS AT IT CONTINUES TO

01:14:40.476 --> 01:14:43.679 region:rollup2
EVOLVE AND UNFOLD EVERYDAY AND

01:14:42.178 --> 01:14:44.680 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHEN COMPLAINTS COME

01:14:43.679 --> 01:14:48.250 region:rollup2
FORWARD.

01:14:44.680 --> 01:14:51.220 region:rollup2
AND CHOOSE IT IS A CHOICE TO

01:14:48.250 --> 01:14:53.889 region:rollup2
REMAIN ANONYMOUS.

01:14:51.220 --> 01:14:56.192 region:rollup2
AND HOW WE'VE BEEN BEGAN TO.

01:14:53.889 --> 01:14:57.593 region:rollup2
WELL IN THIS DESIRE TO HAVE A

01:14:56.192 --> 01:14:59.562 region:rollup2
TRANSPARENT PROCESS

01:14:57.593 --> 01:15:01.564 region:rollup2
HOW WE GUARANTEED DUE PROCESS

01:14:59.562 --> 01:15:03.099 region:rollup2
FOR ALL THE PARTIES INVOLVED.

01:15:01.564 --> 01:15:04.967 region:rollup2
.

01:15:03.099 --> 01:15:06.736 region:rollup2
WHEN.

REMAIN ANONYMOUS.

01:15:08.738 --> 01:15:11.874 region:rollup2
BAH I'M NOT CONVINCED THAT WE

01:15:10.539 --> 01:15:13.809 region:rollup2
CAN HAVE A SYSTEM WHERE PEOPLE

01:15:11.874 --> 01:15:14.777 region:rollup2
FEEL COMFORTABLE AROUND

INVESTIGATORY PROCESS THEN

01:15:39.368 --> 01:15:42.905 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY CONCERNED ABOUT

01:15:41.070 --> 01:15:44.473 region:rollup2
BIASING CREDIBILITY. AND BIAS

01:15:42.905 --> 01:15:45.641 region:rollup2

01:15:44.473 --> 01:15:47.576 region:rollup2
PART OF ANY.

01:15:45.641 --> 01:15:48.844 region:rollup2
COMPETENT

01:15:47.576 --> 01:15:51.313 region:rollup2
HE SAYS ESCRITORIO PROCESS KNOW

01:15:48.844 --> 01:15:53.315 region:rollup2
THOSE ARE THINGS THAT IN ANY.

01:15:51.313 --> 01:15:55.618 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATION WHETHER IT'S THIS

BODY OR IN A PRIVATE CORPORATION

01:15:55.618 --> 01:15:57.119 region:rollup2
WHETHER THERE'S ALL TEARY

01:15:56.152 --> 01:15:59.055 region:rollup2
MOTIVES.

01:15:57.119 --> 01:16:00.756 region:rollup2
AND CREDIBILITY CONCERNS ON ALL

01:15:59.055 --> 01:16:02.024 region:rollup2
SIDES.

01:16:00.756 --> 01:16:03.626 region:rollup2
THOSE ARE THINGS THAT VERY

01:16:02.024 --> 01:16:05.594 region:rollup2
FAIRLY SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN

01:16:03.626 --> 01:16:07.997 region:rollup2
ANY COMPETENT INVESTIGATION.

01:16:05.594 --> 01:16:10.633 region:rollup2
.

01:16:07.997 --> 01:16:12.668 region:rollup2
SO REGARDING THE ISSUE OF

01:16:10.633 --> 01:16:13.302 region:rollup2
ANONYMOUS REPORTING I THINK.

01:16:12.668 --> 01:16:15.371 region:rollup2
THERE'S A REASON ARE SYNONYMOUS

01:16:13.302 --> 01:16:17.073 region:rollup2
WITH.

01:16:15.371 --> 01:16:18.641 region:rollup2
AND AND PART OF IT IS THE FEAR

01:16:17.073 --> 01:16:20.376 region:rollup2
OF RETALIATION BUT OF COURSE

01:16:18.641 --> 01:16:21.010 region:rollup2
ONCE YOU RECEIVE THAT. ANONYMOUS

01:16:20.376 --> 01:16:22.344 region:rollup2

WITH IT.

01:16:22.344 --> 01:16:25.881 region:rollup2
AND THERE HAS TO START TO BE AN

01:16:24.213 --> 01:16:27.817 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATION.

01:16:25.881 --> 01:16:29.318 region:rollup2
AND IT TURNS ON WHAT ENTRY POINT

01:16:27.817 --> 01:16:30.086 region:rollup2
IT COULD BE LET'S JUST SAY

01:16:29.318 --> 01:16:31.654 region:rollup2
HYPOTHETICALLY YOU RECEIVE A

01:16:30.086 --> 01:16:34.090 region:rollup2

BY MEMBERS.

01:16:36.058 --> 01:16:39.628 region:rollup2
THEN AN INVESTIGATION HAS TO

01:16:37.793 --> 01:16:40.763 region:rollup2
START AND USUALLY THERE'S ENOUGH

01:16:39.628 --> 01:16:42.398 region:rollup2
INFORMATION TO START THAT

01:16:40.763 --> 01:16:42.998 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATION TO MAKE

01:16:42.398 --> 01:16:44.066 region:rollup2
DETERMINATIONS ONE WAY OR THE

01:16:42.998 --> 01:16:45.401 region:rollup2

01:16:44.066 --> 01:16:47.002 region:rollup2
AND IN IN SHIRLEY CREDIBILITY

01:16:45.401 --> 01:16:48.170 region:rollup2
AND BIAS

01:16:47.002 --> 01:16:50.306 region:rollup2
CONCERNS SHOULD BE A PART OF

01:16:48.170 --> 01:16:53.075 region:rollup2
THAT INVESTIGATION.

01:16:50.306 --> 01:16:54.543 region:rollup2
IF IT'S ONE MEMBER AND IT SAYS

01:16:53.075 --> 01:16:55.878 region:rollup2
THESE THINGS HAVE BEEN HAPPENING

01:16:54.543 --> 01:16:57.813 region:rollup2
IN THE STAFF WHEN YOU KNOW THE

01:16:55.878 --> 01:16:59.915 region:rollup2
STATUS IT DOESN'T TAKE ROCKET

01:16:57.813 --> 01:17:01.417 region:rollup2
SCIENCE TO TALK. TO WHO'S IN THE

01:16:59.915 --> 01:17:03.752 region:rollup2

01:17:03.752 --> 01:17:05.221 region:rollup2
WHO ARE THE PEOPLE THAT THEY

01:17:04.320 --> 01:17:07.623 region:rollup2
HAD?

01:17:05.221 --> 01:17:09.358 region:rollup2
WHERE DID THEY GO FOR VARIOUS

01:17:07.623 --> 01:17:11.460 region:rollup2
EVENTS AND AND WHAT HAPPENED AT

01:17:09.358 --> 01:17:11.727 region:rollup2
THOSE EVENTS AND I THINK? IT

01:17:11.460 --> 01:17:15.297 region:rollup2
WOULD BE.

01:17:11.727 --> 01:17:17.299 region:rollup2
.

01:17:15.297 --> 01:17:19.135 region:rollup2
I WOULD NOT WANT TESTS TO ASSUME

01:17:17.299 --> 01:17:21.604 region:rollup2
SIMPLY BECAUSE YOU'RE ALLOWING

01:17:19.135 --> 01:17:22.972 region:rollup2
AN AVENUE OF MORE INFORMATION TO

01:17:21.604 --> 01:17:24.540 region:rollup2

THERE'S ANY INDICATION THAT THAT

01:17:26.242 --> 01:17:29.211 region:rollup2
MEANS THAT THIS BODY COULD NOT

01:17:27.877 --> 01:17:30.913 region:rollup2
ADEQUATELY INVESTIGATE THOSE

01:17:29.211 --> 01:17:33.682 region:rollup2
DOES NOT MY ASSUMPTION THAT'S

01:17:30.913 --> 01:17:34.783 region:rollup2
NOT MY SOME SHIRT ALL.*.

01:17:33.682 --> 01:17:37.153 region:rollup2
IF I CAN TOUCH UPON IT I

01:17:34.783 --> 01:17:39.288 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY. WAS RETAINED AS A

01:17:37.153 --> 01:17:40.856 region:rollup2

SOME CHALLENGES THAT OTHER

DOESN'T.

01:17:55.638 --> 01:17:58.574 region:rollup2
.

01:17:56.639 --> 01:18:00.676 region:rollup2
IT DOESN'T A FOR GIVE THE

01:17:58.574 --> 01:18:02.611 region:rollup2
EMPLOYER'S OBLIGATION TO

01:18:00.676 --> 01:18:04.146 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATE AND REMEMBER.

01:18:02.611 --> 01:18:06.782 region:rollup2
THE STANDARD UNDER THE LAW IS

01:18:04.146 --> 01:18:08.817 region:rollup2
NOT THAT WE ABSOLUTELY GET

01:18:06.782 --> 01:18:10.753 region:rollup2
EVERYTHING RIGHT.

01:18:08.817 --> 01:18:12.454 region:rollup2
RIGHT WHEN WE INVESTIGATE WE

01:18:10.753 --> 01:18:13.522 region:rollup2
HAVE THE CO TRAIN CASE IT'S BEEN

THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT

01:18:14.490 --> 01:18:18.594 region:rollup2
CASE THAT SAYS EMPLOYERS HAVE TO

01:18:16.759 --> 01:18:20.729 region:rollup2
ACT REASONABLY. IF TO TAKE

01:18:18.594 --> 01:18:22.865 region:rollup2
REASONABLE STEPS TO TRY TO

01:18:20.729 --> 01:18:24.667 region:rollup2
DETERMINE WHAT IN FACT HAPPENED

01:18:22.865 --> 01:18:26.468 region:rollup2
AND IF SOMETHING INAPPROPRIATE

01:18:24.667 --> 01:18:27.670 region:rollup2
UNLAWFUL HAPPENED WE HAVE TO

01:18:26.468 --> 01:18:29.305 region:rollup2
TAKE APPROPRIATE REMEDIAL

01:18:27.670 --> 01:18:30.973 region:rollup2
ACTIONS TO STOP IT AND PREVENT

01:18:29.305 --> 01:18:32.741 region:rollup2
IT FROM HAPPENING AGAIN. AND SO

01:18:30.973 --> 01:18:33.943 region:rollup2
ANONYMOUS COMPLAINTS HAVE TO BE

01:18:32.741 --> 01:18:35.678 region:rollup2

DIFFERENT MEASURES TO DO IT.

01:18:39.148 --> 01:18:42.451 region:rollup2
AND YOU'RE GOING TO BE

01:18:41.483 --> 01:18:44.420 region:rollup2
REASONABLE.

01:18:42.451 --> 01:18:45.654 region:rollup2
ONCE YOU MAKE A FINDING AND

01:18:44.420 --> 01:18:46.422 region:rollup2
YOU'LL TAKE THE APPROPRIATE

01:18:45.654 --> 01:18:48.190 region:rollup2
REMEDIAL STEPS BASED ON THOSE

01:18:46.422 --> 01:18:49.658 region:rollup2

WANTED TO ADD THAT.

01:18:59.668 --> 01:19:03.606 region:rollup2
.

01:19:01.170 --> 01:19:05.307 region:rollup2
RECOGNIZING THE DIFFICULTY OF

01:19:03.606 --> 01:19:06.442 region:rollup2
REPORTING AND AND THE POWER

01:19:05.307 --> 01:19:07.810 region:rollup2
IMBALANCES THAT MAKE IT

01:19:06.442 --> 01:19:09.912 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY HARD WITHIN A

01:19:07.810 --> 01:19:11.580 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE. WE ARE EXCITED TO

01:19:09.912 --> 01:19:13.015 region:rollup2
SEE MORE LEGISLATURE'S OWN AND

01:19:11.580 --> 01:19:15.150 region:rollup2
CONGRESS CONSIDERING

01:19:13.015 --> 01:19:16.285 region:rollup2
I'M CLIMATE SURVEY IS WHICH IS A

01:19:15.150 --> 01:19:17.386 region:rollup2
WAY TO GET SORT OF. OR

01:19:16.285 --> 01:19:19.521 region:rollup2
GENERALIZED INFORMATION ABOUT

01:19:17.386 --> 01:19:21.924 region:rollup2
WHAT'S GOING ON.

01:19:19.521 --> 01:19:23.525 region:rollup2
AND PREVALENCE OF HARASSMENT

01:19:21.924 --> 01:19:24.727 region:rollup2
THE EFFICACY OF THE POLICIES AND

01:19:23.525 --> 01:19:26.528 region:rollup2
PROCEDURES AND.

01:19:24.727 --> 01:19:27.529 region:rollup2
JUST RECOGNIZING THAT THERE

01:19:26.528 --> 01:19:30.032 region:rollup2
WILL STILL BE PEOPLE WHO WON'T

01:19:27.529 --> 01:19:31.734 region:rollup2
COME FORWARD HAVING SOME SORT OF

01:19:30.032 --> 01:19:34.203 region:rollup2
WAY TO COLLECT THE INFORMATION.

01:19:31.734 --> 01:19:35.037 region:rollup2
YOUR CLIMATE SURVEY IS

01:19:34.203 --> 01:19:37.940 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT.

01:19:35.037 --> 01:19:38.474 region:rollup2
AND I THINK DRESSES SOME OF THE

01:19:37.940 --> 01:19:40.042 region:rollup2
ISSUES THERE.

01:19:38.474 --> 01:19:40.976 region:rollup2
I AGREE AND AM HAPPY THAT THE

01:19:40.042 --> 01:19:43.112 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE.

01:19:40.976 --> 01:19:43.646 region:rollup2
IS CONDUCTING ONE AS WE SPEAK

01:19:43.112 --> 01:19:44.980 region:rollup2
OR AT LEAST BEGINNING THE

01:19:43.646 --> 01:19:45.948 region:rollup2
PROCESS.

01:19:44.980 --> 01:19:47.216 region:rollup2
I THINK WITH REGARD TO

01:19:45.948 --> 01:19:49.118 region:rollup2
RETALIATES OF COURSE IT'S OUR

01:19:47.216 --> 01:19:51.487 region:rollup2
COLLECTIVE GOAL TO TUNE TO

01:19:49.118 --> 01:19:54.423 region:rollup2
CREATE A CULTURE AND A WORKPLACE

01:19:51.487 --> 01:19:56.091 region:rollup2
WHERE. RETALIATION IS AN AT THE

01:19:54.423 --> 01:19:58.761 region:rollup2
AT THE TOP OF ONE'S LISTEN TERMS

01:19:56.091 --> 01:19:59.428 region:rollup2
OF FEAR ABOUT STEPPING UP OF

01:19:58.761 --> 01:20:00.963 region:rollup2
PROTECTING THEIR OWN INDIVIDUAL.

01:19:59.428 --> 01:20:02.531 region:rollup2
RIGHTS

01:20:00.963 --> 01:20:03.999 region:rollup2
I AM CURIOUS BASED ON YOUR

01:20:02.531 --> 01:20:05.401 region:rollup2
COLLECTIVE EXPERIENCES IF YOU

01:20:03.999 --> 01:20:07.403 region:rollup2
CAN POINT TO A CIRCUMSTANCE OR

01:20:05.401 --> 01:20:09.238 region:rollup2
WORKPLACE.

01:20:07.403 --> 01:20:12.408 region:rollup2
WHERE?

01:20:09.238 --> 01:20:14.109 region:rollup2
WHERE A SYSTEM WAS PUT IN PLACE

01:20:12.408 --> 01:20:16.178 region:rollup2
WERE RETALIATION WAS NEVER A

01:20:14.109 --> 01:20:17.413 region:rollup2
QUESTION?

01:20:16.178 --> 01:20:19.415 region:rollup2
AND I SAY THAT BECAUSE MY

01:20:17.413 --> 01:20:21.917 region:rollup2
CONCERN IS WE HAVE THESE. ARE

01:20:19.415 --> 01:20:23.385 region:rollup2
EXTREME EXPECTATIONS.

01:20:21.917 --> 01:20:24.720 region:rollup2
AT AND I'M NOT CONVINCED THAT

01:20:23.385 --> 01:20:27.790 region:rollup2
I'M OPEN TO BE CONVINCED

01:20:24.720 --> 01:20:28.891 region:rollup2
OTHERWISE THAT A SYSTEM EXIST

01:20:27.790 --> 01:20:32.227 region:rollup2
WHERE THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO

01:20:28.891 --> 01:20:33.095 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY FOR RETALIATION.

01:20:32.227 --> 01:20:35.664 region:rollup2
AND I DON'T WANT TO CREATE AN

01:20:33.095 --> 01:20:37.800 region:rollup2
EXPECTATION THAT WE EVEN THERE'S

01:20:35.664 --> 01:20:38.801 region:rollup2
A HIGHER STANDARD BECAUSE WE ARE

01:20:37.800 --> 01:20:40.336 region:rollup2
ELECTED OFFICIALS AND WE SPENT

01:20:38.801 --> 01:20:41.670 region:rollup2
AND AND WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY

01:20:40.336 --> 01:20:43.005 region:rollup2

BOTH IN TERMS OF OUR CONDUCT OUR

01:20:43.005 --> 01:20:45.441 region:rollup2
BEHAVIOR AND PUBLIC RESOURCES

01:20:44.440 --> 01:20:49.144 region:rollup2
USED.

01:20:45.441 --> 01:20:50.479 region:rollup2
.

01:20:49.144 --> 01:20:52.881 region:rollup2
BUT THE PEACE AROUND RETALIATION

01:20:50.479 --> 01:20:55.617 region:rollup2
AN EXPECTATION THAT I'M

01:20:52.881 --> 01:20:57.019 region:rollup2
PROTECTED.

01:20:55.617 --> 01:21:00.255 region:rollup2
PERIOD I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT'S

01:20:57.019 --> 01:21:01.890 region:rollup2
REALLY REASONABLE REALISTIC.

01:21:00.255 --> 01:21:04.093 region:rollup2
NOW I THINK THAT'S A FAIR

01:21:01.890 --> 01:21:06.662 region:rollup2
CONCERN YEAH I'M UNFORTUNATELY

01:21:04.093 --> 01:21:07.396 region:rollup2
STATISTICS SHOW THAT WHEN WE'RE

01:21:06.662 --> 01:21:08.931 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT HARASSMENT

01:21:07.396 --> 01:21:09.832 region:rollup2
DISCRIMINATION RETALIATION IT IS

01:21:08.931 --> 01:21:11.800 region:rollup2
RETALIATION.

01:21:09.832 --> 01:21:14.470 region:rollup2
MORE

01:21:11.800 --> 01:21:16.605 region:rollup2
THEN THE OTHER FORMS OF A

01:21:14.470 --> 01:21:18.307 region:rollup2
UNLAWFUL CONDUCT YOU COULD HAVE

01:21:16.605 --> 01:21:19.808 region:rollup2
A SEXUAL HARASSMENT COMPLAINT.

01:21:18.307 --> 01:21:21.276 region:rollup2
BASED ON ALLEGATIONS OF

01:21:19.808 --> 01:21:23.712 region:rollup2
INAPPROPRIATE CONDUCT THAT MAY

01:21:21.276 --> 01:21:24.847 region:rollup2
NOT RISE TO THE LEVEL OF ILLEGAL

01:21:23.712 --> 01:21:27.015 region:rollup2
OR ACTIONABLE HARASSMENT

01:21:24.847 --> 01:21:28.150 region:rollup2
RETALIATES AND.

01:21:27.015 --> 01:21:30.319 region:rollup2
THAT PERSON WAS RETALIATED

01:21:28.150 --> 01:21:31.854 region:rollup2
AGAINST READ THE EEOC STATS

01:21:30.319 --> 01:21:34.323 region:rollup2
EVERY YEAR READ THAT IF THE H.

01:21:31.854 --> 01:21:35.791 region:rollup2
SETS EVERY YEAR MORE MONEY IS

01:21:34.323 --> 01:21:37.292 region:rollup2
RECOVERED IN RETALIATION

01:21:35.791 --> 01:21:38.994 region:rollup2
LAWSUITS THAT DISCRIMINATION AND

01:21:37.292 --> 01:21:40.429 region:rollup2
HER.

01:21:38.994 --> 01:21:40.963 region:rollup2
SO IT'S VERY FAIRS MAFIC WHEN I

01:21:40.429 --> 01:21:42.631 region:rollup2
DO TRAINING WITH MY CLAIM

01:21:40.963 --> 01:21:45.000 region:rollup2
TELL THEM

01:21:42.631 --> 01:21:46.935 region:rollup2
THIS IS THE AREA OF LAW THAT YOU

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:48.637 region:rollup2
NEED TO PAY ATTENTION TO. AND

01:21:46.935 --> 01:21:50.939 region:rollup2
THEN I TRIED TO GIVE THEM AN

01:21:48.637 --> 01:21:52.741 region:rollup2
ANALOGY. OF GO BACK TO WHEN WE

01:21:50.939 --> 01:21:55.277 region:rollup2
WERE IN.

01:21:52.741 --> 01:21:57.479 region:rollup2
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL AND ON THE

01:21:55.277 --> 01:21:59.348 region:rollup2
PLAYGROUND DAHLE AND TOMMY GOT

01:21:57.479 --> 01:22:00.649 region:rollup2
INTO A FIGHT YOUR AND THE

01:21:59.348 --> 01:22:02.284 region:rollup2
TEACHER IN THE CLASSROOM

01:22:00.649 --> 01:22:04.186 region:rollup2
BECOMING CRYING YOU DIDN'T

01:22:02.284 --> 01:22:06.789 region:rollup2
WITNESS SAID.

01:22:04.186 --> 01:22:09.525 region:rollup2
WHAT HAPPENS IN CASES LIKE THIS

01:22:06.789 --> 01:22:13.195 region:rollup2
USUALLY HAVE A GROUP OF FELLOW

01:22:09.525 --> 01:22:15.097 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEES OR FELLOW? SUPERVISORS

01:22:13.195 --> 01:22:16.899 region:rollup2
WHO SUPPORT THE PERSON WHO'S

01:22:15.097 --> 01:22:18.400 region:rollup2
MAKING THE COMPLAINT AND THEN

01:22:16.899 --> 01:22:20.702 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE A GROUP WHO SUPPORTS

01:22:18.400 --> 01:22:22.905 region:rollup2
THE ACCUSED AND WHAT'S WHERE WE

01:22:20.702 --> 01:22:25.107 region:rollup2
HAVE. TROUBLE BECAUSE IF THOSE

01:22:22.905 --> 01:22:27.075 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS ARE VERY ROOTED IN

01:22:25.107 --> 01:22:29.678 region:rollup2
THEIR DEFENSE OF ONE PERSON OF

01:22:27.075 --> 01:22:31.246 region:rollup2
THE OTHER. AND THEY. ENGAGE AN

01:22:29.678 --> 01:22:33.182 region:rollup2
ADVERSE EMPLOYMENT ACTION

01:22:31.246 --> 01:22:34.516 region:rollup2
TOWARDS THE COMPLAIN ENTER ANY

01:22:33.182 --> 01:22:36.084 region:rollup2
WITNESS WHO'S INOLVED IN AN

01:22:34.516 --> 01:22:38.720 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATION WE ARE IN A

01:22:36.084 --> 01:22:42.624 region:rollup2
RETALIATION SITUATION NOW. IS IT

01:22:38.720 --> 01:22:44.626 region:rollup2
EVERY WORKPLACE INCIDENT ADVERSE

01:22:42.624 --> 01:22:46.829 region:rollup2
AND GIVES RISE TO A RETALIATION

01:22:44.626 --> 01:22:47.963 region:rollup2
CLAIM NO WE HAVE LEGAL STANDARDS

01:22:46.829 --> 01:22:50.265 region:rollup2
AS WELL RIGHT IT HAS TO

01:22:47.963 --> 01:22:50.966 region:rollup2
MATERIALLY AFFECT AND CHANGE THE

01:22:50.265 --> 01:22:53.569 region:rollup2
TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF

01:22:50.966 --> 01:22:55.604 region:rollup2
EMPLOYMENT. DETER PEOPLE FROM

01:22:53.569 --> 01:22:56.004 region:rollup2
COMING FORTH IN BRINGING OTHER

01:22:55.604 --> 01:22:57.906 region:rollup2
CIVIL RIGHTS CLAIM

01:22:56.004 --> 01:22:59.508 region:rollup2
SO FOR.

01:22:57.906 --> 01:23:00.476 region:rollup2
BUT THAT'S THE TRUE REALITY OF

01:22:59.508 --> 01:23:02.044 region:rollup2
IT IF WE JUST LOOK AT IT FROM A

01:23:00.476 --> 01:23:04.880 region:rollup2
HUMAN PERSON.

01:23:02.044 --> 01:23:06.448 region:rollup2
RIGHT IS THAT YOU HAVE TO GROUPS

01:23:04.880 --> 01:23:07.583 region:rollup2
OF PEOPLE WHO ARE SUPPORTING TO

01:23:06.448 --> 01:23:09.952 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT PEOPLE ON TWO SIDES OF

01:23:07.583 --> 01:23:13.288 region:rollup2
THE SITUATION.

01:23:09.952 --> 01:23:14.890 region:rollup2
SO I AGREE WITH YOU AND.

01:23:13.288 --> 01:23:16.391 region:rollup2
THERE'S PROBABLY NOT A PERFECT

01:23:14.890 --> 01:23:18.694 region:rollup2
WORLD WHERE RETALIATION WILL

01:23:16.391 --> 01:23:19.328 region:rollup2
NEVER BE AN ISSUE IT'S A VERY

01:23:18.694 --> 01:23:19.561 region:rollup2
TOUGH PROBLEM AND ONE EMPLOYERS

01:23:19.328 --> 01:23:21.196 region:rollup2
HAVE TO

01:23:19.561 --> 01:23:23.632 region:rollup2
COMMITTED.

01:23:21.196 --> 01:23:25.267 region:rollup2
TO PREVENTING.

01:23:23.632 --> 01:23:27.669 region:rollup2
AND THEN WHAT HAVE YOU FOUND.

01:23:25.267 --> 01:23:30.172 region:rollup2
IT THE AND CULTURE IN POLICY

01:23:27.669 --> 01:23:31.273 region:rollup2
AND PRACTICE.

01:23:30.172 --> 01:23:32.708 region:rollup2
THAT CAN MITIGATE THAT ON THE

01:23:31.273 --> 01:23:34.543 region:rollup2
FRONT END.

01:23:32.708 --> 01:23:36.144 region:rollup2
IF I'M THE FRIEND AND I AM A

01:23:34.543 --> 01:23:38.213 region:rollup2

US ALL OF US AS I SAID BEFORE

01:23:43.185 --> 01:23:45.220 region:rollup2

01:23:44.520 --> 01:23:47.856 region:rollup2
THROUGH THE WORLD WITH

01:23:45.220 --> 01:23:51.860 region:rollup2
PERCEPTIONS AND MISPERCEPTIONS.

01:23:47.856 --> 01:23:54.363 region:rollup2
BASED ON WHAT WE VIEW OF PEOPLE

01:23:51.860 --> 01:23:55.764 region:rollup2
NOT LIKE US LIKE GUYS AND SO

01:23:54.363 --> 01:23:56.732 region:rollup2

PREVENTATIVE TRAINING IN THE

01:24:01.904 --> 01:24:05.173 region:rollup2
ELIMINATION OF IMPLICIT IN AN

UNCONSCIOUS BIAS WE MAY BE

01:24:05.173 --> 01:24:08.844 region:rollup2
BECAME CAN BE A LITTLE BIT MORE

01:24:07.042 --> 01:24:10.712 region:rollup2
AWARE WHEN AN ACTUAL SITUATION

01:24:08.844 --> 01:24:11.980 region:rollup2
HAPPENS AT WORK AND NOT ACT ON

01:24:10.712 --> 01:24:12.981 region:rollup2

01:24:22.758 --> 01:24:28.130 region:rollup2
MORE I REALIZE.

01:24:24.793 --> 01:24:29.331 region:rollup2

01:25:35.430 --> 01:25:39.101 region:rollup2
WORLD AND I KNOW THAT CANDIDATES

01:25:37.366 --> 01:25:40.369 region:rollup2
CAN BE.

01:25:39.101 --> 01:25:42.170 region:rollup2
DESTROYED BY WHISPERING

THE WHOLE BALANCE OF THIS TOPIC.

01:26:00.288 --> 01:26:04.259 region:rollup2
OF FALSE ACCUSATIONS.

01:26:02.658 --> 01:26:06.294 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE CAN MANIPULATE AND I

01:26:04.259 --> 01:26:07.963 region:rollup2

HISSES.

01:26:42.431 --> 01:26:47.002 region:rollup2
SO SO WRONG AND SO.

01:26:45.333 --> 01:26:49.504 region:rollup2
I WANTED TRY AND MAKE SURE THAT

01:26:47.002 --> 01:26:51.373 region:rollup2
WE ADDRESS MALICIOUS INTENT.

01:26:49.504 --> 01:26:55.010 region:rollup2
SO ARE THERE.

01:26:51.373 --> 01:26:57.279 region:rollup2
BESIDES SUING FOR DEFAMATION.

01:26:55.010 --> 01:27:00.182 region:rollup2
ARE THERE OTHER REMEDIES ARE

01:26:57.279 --> 01:27:03.218 region:rollup2
THERE ARE THERE CRIMINAL.

01:27:00.182 --> 01:27:05.921 region:rollup2
URGES IF YOU LIE AND YOU FALSELY

01:27:03.218 --> 01:27:08.023 region:rollup2
ACCUSE SOMEONE ARE THERE.

01:27:05.921 --> 01:27:09.424 region:rollup2
CRIMINAL REMAIN HE'S ADJUSTED.

01:27:08.023 --> 01:27:10.659 region:rollup2
HIS EUROPE EUROPE NOW CREATED A

01:27:09.424 --> 01:27:12.627 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT KIND OF VICTIM RIGHT

01:27:10.659 --> 01:27:14.830 region:rollup2
SO NOW THE ACCUSED IS THE VICTIM

01:27:12.627 --> 01:27:17.666 region:rollup2
WHEN THAT PERSON MAY HAVE. DONE

01:27:14.830 --> 01:27:18.266 region:rollup2
NOTHING AT ALL BUT IT'S JUST

01:27:17.666 --> 01:27:18.767 region:rollup2
PART OF ATTACK IS THAT UNLIKE

01:27:18.266 --> 01:27:20.869 region:rollup2
THE.

01:27:18.767 --> 01:27:22.137 region:rollup2
POLICIES ARE THE POLITICS

01:27:20.869 --> 01:27:23.371 region:rollup2
YOU'RE A OF OF THAT PERSON. AND

01:27:22.137 --> 01:27:26.541 region:rollup2
SO I'M JUST

01:27:23.371 --> 01:27:27.609 region:rollup2
CURIOUS HOW WE BRING THE BALANCE

01:27:26.541 --> 01:27:29.177 region:rollup2
IN HERE SO THAT. WE WOULD TAKE

01:27:27.609 --> 01:27:30.078 region:rollup2
HER THE CREEPS.

01:27:29.177 --> 01:27:32.214 region:rollup2
BUT WE DON'T HAVE ALL THESE

01:27:30.078 --> 01:27:33.748 region:rollup2
SCARLET LETTERS.

01:27:32.214 --> 01:27:34.282 region:rollup2
THAT BALL PEOPLE FOR THE REST

01:27:33.748 --> 01:27:36.151 region:rollup2
THEIR LIVES WHEN THEY WERE

01:27:34.282 --> 01:27:38.320 region:rollup2
INNOCENT.

01:27:36.151 --> 01:27:38.487 region:rollup2
YEAH I APPRECIATE THAT CONCERN

01:27:38.320 --> 01:27:41.857 region:rollup2
AND.

01:27:38.487 --> 01:27:44.326 region:rollup2
.

01:27:41.857 --> 01:27:47.429 region:rollup2
UNFORTUNATELY I DON'T THINK

01:27:44.326 --> 01:27:49.564 region:rollup2
THERE IS A. HIGH PERCENTAGE OF

01:27:47.429 --> 01:27:51.199 region:rollup2
TRULY MALICIOUS FRAUDULENT

01:27:49.564 --> 01:27:53.702 region:rollup2
CLAIMS BEING FILED THAT'S NOT

01:27:51.199 --> 01:27:54.903 region:rollup2
WHAT WE ARE HEARING IN THE NEWS

01:27:53.702 --> 01:27:56.037 region:rollup2
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT'S WHAT

01:27:54.903 --> 01:27:58.540 region:rollup2
YOU'RE EXPERIENCING HERE IN THE

01:27:56.037 --> 01:28:01.510 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE. BUT I WILL TELL YOU

01:27:58.540 --> 01:28:04.546 region:rollup2
THAT IT'S NOT UNCOMMON TO HAVE

01:28:01.510 --> 01:28:06.982 region:rollup2
THE ISOLATED. ILL MOTIVATED

01:28:04.546 --> 01:28:08.250 region:rollup2
MALICIOUS FRAUDULENT CLAIM MADE

01:28:06.982 --> 01:28:10.719 region:rollup2
FOR ALL TERRIER REASONS.

01:28:08.250 --> 01:28:11.753 region:rollup2
AND.

01:28:10.719 --> 01:28:13.755 region:rollup2
IT SHOULD NOT CHANGED THE

01:28:11.753 --> 01:28:16.858 region:rollup2
APPROACH TO INVESTIGATING.

01:28:13.755 --> 01:28:18.793 region:rollup2
THAT COMPLAINTS AND A GOOD

01:28:16.858 --> 01:28:20.128 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATOR THROUGH CREDIBILITY

01:28:18.793 --> 01:28:21.630 region:rollup2
ASSESSMENTS AND EVIDENCE

01:28:20.128 --> 01:28:23.064 region:rollup2
GATHERING HOPEFULLY WE'LL GET TO

01:28:21.630 --> 01:28:24.633 region:rollup2
THE BOTTOM AS TO WHETHER THERE'S

01:28:23.064 --> 01:28:25.934 region:rollup2
REASONABLE SUSPICION THAT THIS

01:28:24.633 --> 01:28:27.636 region:rollup2
IS A FRAGILE ESQUE FRAUDULENT

01:28:25.934 --> 01:28:30.005 region:rollup2
CLAIM.

01:28:27.636 --> 01:28:32.207 region:rollup2
THERE IS CASE LAW TO SUPPORT

01:28:30.005 --> 01:28:34.643 region:rollup2
THAT IF THERE IS A DETERMINATION

01:28:32.207 --> 01:28:37.612 region:rollup2
MADE THAT A HARASSMENT COMPLAINT

01:28:34.643 --> 01:28:39.281 region:rollup2
IS MADE FRAUDULENTLY. WITH

01:28:37.612 --> 01:28:40.916 region:rollup2
MALICE THAT APPROPRIATE

01:28:39.281 --> 01:28:43.418 region:rollup2
DISCIPLINARY ACTION UP TO AND

01:28:40.916 --> 01:28:43.885 region:rollup2
INCLUDING TERMINATION CAMBY HAT

01:28:43.418 --> 01:28:45.987 region:rollup2
SO FROM AN EMPLOYMENT

01:28:43.885 --> 01:28:48.390 region:rollup2
PERSPECTIVE BUT I WOULDN'T CROSS

01:28:45.987 --> 01:28:50.659 region:rollup2
THAT BRIDGE QUICKLY RIGHT I MEAN

01:28:48.390 --> 01:28:53.128 region:rollup2
I WOULD REALLY MAKE SURE THAT WE

01:28:50.659 --> 01:28:55.664 region:rollup2
HAVE A CREDIBLE. OBJECTIVE

01:28:53.128 --> 01:28:57.766 region:rollup2
FINDING THAT THIS CLAIM WAS

01:28:55.664 --> 01:28:58.934 region:rollup2
BROUGHT FRAUDULENTLY IS SO

01:28:57.766 --> 01:29:00.635 region:rollup2
THOUGH THERE IS CASE LAW TO

01:28:58.934 --> 01:29:03.305 region:rollup2
SUPPORT THAT THE EMPLOYER SAYS

01:29:00.635 --> 01:29:04.840 region:rollup2
LOOK YOU YOU KNOW YOU'RE ATTY

01:29:03.305 --> 01:29:05.407 region:rollup2
HERE RIGHT.

01:29:04.840 --> 01:29:07.108 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHAT YOU CAN DO IS AN

01:29:05.407 --> 01:29:09.878 region:rollup2
EMPLOYER.

01:29:07.108 --> 01:29:12.547 region:rollup2
AS THE PERSON AS THE INDIVIDUAL

01:29:09.878 --> 01:29:14.716 region:rollup2
WHO HAD THOSE FALSE.

01:29:12.547 --> 01:29:16.685 region:rollup2
ALLEGATIONS MADE AGAINST HIM HER

01:29:14.716 --> 01:29:19.287 region:rollup2
YOUR REDRESS REALLY IS IN OUR

01:29:16.685 --> 01:29:19.988 region:rollup2
LEGAL SYSTEM IT IS THROUGH THE

01:29:19.287 --> 01:29:22.557 region:rollup2
CIVIL.

01:29:19.988 --> 01:29:24.392 region:rollup2
CLAIMS THAT YOU MAY HAVE.

01:29:22.557 --> 01:29:26.061 region:rollup2
THERE ARE EMPLOYEE MEN

01:29:24.392 --> 01:29:28.563 region:rollup2
ATTORNEYS WHO HAVE NOW STARTED

01:29:26.061 --> 01:29:29.931 region:rollup2
TO MAKE THAT THEIR SPECIALTY ONE

01:29:28.563 --> 01:29:31.399 region:rollup2
OF WHICH IS ACTUALLY IN OUR

01:29:29.931 --> 01:29:33.168 region:rollup2
REGION HERE AND HE'S VERY GOOD

01:29:31.399 --> 01:29:35.904 region:rollup2
AT IT.

01:29:33.168 --> 01:29:39.007 region:rollup2
BUT IT IS A CIVIL REMEDY NOT A

01:29:35.904 --> 01:29:41.176 region:rollup2
CRIMINAL REMEDY.

01:29:39.007 --> 01:29:43.378 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I'VE SEEN

01:29:41.176 --> 01:29:45.313 region:rollup2
AS IT RELATES TO.

01:29:43.378 --> 01:29:47.349 region:rollup2
IT CONCERNS OF OF.

01:29:45.313 --> 01:29:49.150 region:rollup2
ALLEGATIONS AS WELL AS

01:29:47.349 --> 01:29:50.852 region:rollup2
ADDRESSING RETALIATION IS PROMPT

01:29:49.150 --> 01:29:51.953 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATIONS. BY THE CASE

01:29:50.852 --> 01:29:53.555 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW IS JUST ARGUING IN

01:29:51.953 --> 01:29:54.890 region:rollup2
FRONT OF THE CALIFORNIA COURT OF

01:29:53.555 --> 01:29:56.224 region:rollup2
APPEALS YESTERDAY BUT THE

01:29:54.890 --> 01:29:58.627 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATION TOOK THREE POINT

01:29:56.224 --> 01:29:59.160 region:rollup2
FIVE YEARS THREE POINT FIVE

01:29:58.627 --> 01:30:01.496 region:rollup2
YEARS. ABOUT MY LAW DEGREE

01:29:59.160 --> 01:30:03.131 region:rollup2
LISTA.

01:30:01.496 --> 01:30:05.467 region:rollup2
THAT DAY TO INVESTIGATE A A

01:30:03.131 --> 01:30:06.001 region:rollup2
SIMPLE AYE ISSUE IN THE

01:30:05.467 --> 01:30:09.070 region:rollup2
WORKPLACE.

01:30:06.001 --> 01:30:11.039 region:rollup2
AND SO THAT CUTS BOTH WAYS IT

01:30:09.070 --> 01:30:12.440 region:rollup2
GIVES THE MESSAGE.

01:30:11.039 --> 01:30:14.075 region:rollup2
WE DON'T CARE AND WE DON'T WANT

01:30:12.440 --> 01:30:15.310 region:rollup2
YOUR COMPLAINTS

01:30:14.075 --> 01:30:17.312 region:rollup2
BOB AND SO IF YOU'RE GONNA

01:30:15.310 --> 01:30:19.514 region:rollup2
COMPLAIN IT'S GOING TO GO INTO A

01:30:17.312 --> 01:30:21.483 region:rollup2
HOLE AND AND THERE'S GONNA BE NO

01:30:19.514 --> 01:30:23.218 region:rollup2
REMEDIAL MEASURES. NOW IF ON THE

01:30:21.483 --> 01:30:25.120 region:rollup2
FLIPSIDE.

01:30:23.218 --> 01:30:26.655 region:rollup2
THAT THE PERSON FROM FROM WHOM

01:30:25.120 --> 01:30:27.922 region:rollup2
THAT COMPLAINT WAS MADE ABOUT

01:30:26.655 --> 01:30:29.090 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE AN OUTSTANDING

01:30:27.922 --> 01:30:30.425 region:rollup2
COMPLAINT AGAINST THEM FOR THREE

01:30:29.090 --> 01:30:32.761 region:rollup2
AND A HALF YEARS.

01:30:30.425 --> 01:30:33.495 region:rollup2
SO THAT OF COURSE IS ONE OF THE

01:30:32.761 --> 01:30:35.163 region:rollup2
WORST I'VE SEEN.

01:30:33.495 --> 01:30:36.598 region:rollup2
IN REPRESENTING PUBLIC

01:30:35.163 --> 01:30:37.632 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEES FOR TWENTY YEARS YOU

01:30:36.598 --> 01:30:38.867 region:rollup2
DON'T WANT TO HAVE AN

01:30:37.632 --> 01:30:40.302 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATION GO ON FOR THREE

01:30:38.867 --> 01:30:42.337 region:rollup2
POINT FIVE YEARS.

01:30:40.302 --> 01:30:45.106 region:rollup2
BUT.

01:30:42.337 --> 01:30:46.474 region:rollup2
THAT ISN'T IT IS GOING ON AND I

01:30:45.106 --> 01:30:48.243 region:rollup2
THINK HAVING A PROMPT

01:30:46.474 --> 01:30:51.813 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATION.

01:30:48.243 --> 01:30:52.547 region:rollup2
IS KEY TO ADDRESSING SOME OF

01:30:51.813 --> 01:30:54.416 region:rollup2
THESE ISSUES AND REAL TIME.

01:30:52.547 --> 01:30:56.351 region:rollup2
.

01:30:54.416 --> 01:30:58.486 region:rollup2
IN ORDER TO ENCOURAGE THE KIND

01:30:56.351 --> 01:31:01.189 region:rollup2
OF WORKPLACE THAT YOU WANT AND

01:30:58.486 --> 01:31:03.191 region:rollup2
DISCOURAGE CONCERNS BOMB WHETHER

01:31:01.189 --> 01:31:04.826 region:rollup2
THOSE CONCERNS ARE ARE VALIDATED

01:31:03.191 --> 01:31:07.162 region:rollup2
BY STATISTICS ARE NOT. THE

01:31:04.826 --> 01:31:08.496 region:rollup2
CONCERNS ABOUT US SOME SORT OF

01:31:07.162 --> 01:31:09.965 region:rollup2
FALSE REPORTING WHICH AGAIN I

01:31:08.496 --> 01:31:11.666 region:rollup2
THINK FALSE REPORTING AS

01:31:09.965 --> 01:31:12.967 region:rollup2
INDICATED BY MY COLLEAGUE IS IS

01:31:11.666 --> 01:31:15.270 region:rollup2
REALLY STATISTICALLY NOT AN

01:31:12.967 --> 01:31:17.372 region:rollup2
ISSUE.

01:31:15.270 --> 01:31:18.673 region:rollup2
BY PRETTY I DISLIKE THAT I GO

01:31:17.372 --> 01:31:19.808 region:rollup2
LIVE ENTITLED FELLOW PANELISTS

01:31:18.673 --> 01:31:21.042 region:rollup2
IN SAYING THAT I THINK ARE

01:31:19.808 --> 01:31:22.310 region:rollup2
SHOULD FOCUS SHOULD BE ON.

01:31:21.042 --> 01:31:24.145 region:rollup2
ACROSS THE SEA IS.

PROM PROCESS CEASEFIRE FOR

01:31:24.145 --> 01:31:28.683 region:rollup2
HANDLING CLAIMS.

01:31:27.649 --> 01:31:31.186 region:rollup2
AND THAT BENEFITS

01:31:28.683 --> 01:31:31.753 region:rollup2
BOTH THOSE ON BOTH PARTIES AND

01:31:31.186 --> 01:31:32.754 region:rollup2
THAT SHOULD BE OUR FOCUS ON

01:31:31.753 --> 01:31:34.022 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:31:32.754 --> 01:31:34.856 region:rollup2
I THINK WE'RE GETTING A

01:31:34.022 --> 01:31:35.857 region:rollup2
SITUATIONS WHERE IS MUCH MORE

01:31:34.856 --> 01:31:37.659 region:rollup2
LIKELY THAT SOMEBODY WILL.

01:31:35.857 --> 01:31:39.094 region:rollup2
REPORT DONE AND NOT HAVE THE

01:31:37.659 --> 01:31:40.762 region:rollup2
CLAIMED TAKING SERIOUSLY.

01:31:39.094 --> 01:31:42.163 region:rollup2
THAT IS THE REAL CONCERNED

RIGHT NOW.

01:31:42.163 --> 01:31:44.966 region:rollup2
AS OPPOSED TO THE FALSE

01:31:43.064 --> 01:31:45.934 region:rollup2
ACCUSATIONS BUT. THAT BOTH

01:31:44.966 --> 01:31:48.870 region:rollup2
CIRCUMSTANCE THAT IS A FAIR

01:32:41.689 --> 01:32:45.460 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES PAY SETTLEMENTS BUT I

01:32:43.391 --> 01:32:47.595 region:rollup2
HAD DEFINITELY SEEN TIMES WHEN

01:32:45.460 --> 01:32:49.197 region:rollup2
IT WE CITIES. PAID CLAIMS

01:32:47.595 --> 01:32:52.367 region:rollup2
AGAINST THE US SETTLEMENTS TO

01:32:49.197 --> 01:32:55.203 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEES THAT THEY FELT.

01:32:52.367 --> 01:32:55.737 region:rollup2
WHAT THEY MIGHT NOT BELIEVE THAT

01:32:55.203 --> 01:32:56.805 region:rollup2
THEY THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN

01:32:55.737 --> 01:32:59.774 region:rollup2
INCLINED TO?

01:32:56.805 --> 01:33:00.208 region:rollup2
FIGHT THE CHARGER GO TO COURT

01:32:59.774 --> 01:33:02.243 region:rollup2
BUT INSTEAD OF EVEN

01:33:00.208 --> 01:33:03.511 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATING THINGS LIKE

01:33:02.243 --> 01:33:05.013 region:rollup2
WORKPLACE HARASSMENT COMPLAINT

01:33:03.511 --> 01:33:06.247 region:rollup2
THEY DECIDED TO SETTLE THESE ARE

01:33:05.013 --> 01:33:07.248 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEES WHO HAD LEFT WHO ARE

01:33:06.247 --> 01:33:09.584 region:rollup2
THEN GOING TO BRING.

01:33:07.248 --> 01:33:10.885 region:rollup2
CIVIL LAWSUITS FORWARD AND

01:33:09.584 --> 01:33:12.754 region:rollup2
DECIDED TO SETTLE JUST BECAUSE

01:33:10.885 --> 01:33:14.322 region:rollup2
OF DOING A COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS

01:33:12.754 --> 01:33:15.190 region:rollup2
AND THINKING THAT IT WAS JUST

01:33:14.322 --> 01:33:17.559 region:rollup2
LESS EXPENSIVE FOR THEM TO

01:33:15.190 --> 01:33:20.962 region:rollup2
SETTLE. A CASE THEN TO TAKE IT

01:33:17.559 --> 01:33:22.230 region:rollup2
TO COURT OR TO EVEN LAUNCH OF A

01:33:20.962 --> 01:33:24.265 region:rollup2
FORMAL LONG INVESTIGATION.

01:33:22.230 --> 01:33:26.634 region:rollup2
SO HOW DO YOU.

01:33:24.265 --> 01:33:27.101 region:rollup2
NOW I UNDERSTAND SOME BECOMING

01:33:26.634 --> 01:33:28.336 region:rollup2
FOR WITH THE WORKPLACE

01:33:27.101 --> 01:33:29.471 region:rollup2
COMPLAINTS ARE FROM THEM CALLING

01:33:28.336 --> 01:33:31.206 region:rollup2
A LAWSUIT.

01:33:29.471 --> 01:33:33.608 region:rollup2
BUT

01:33:31.206 --> 01:33:35.844 region:rollup2
DOES THAT IF IF WE'RE GOING TO

01:33:33.608 --> 01:33:37.879 region:rollup2
MAKE EVERY SETTLEMENT PUBLIC.

01:33:35.844 --> 01:33:40.615 region:rollup2
OR MAKE.

01:33:37.879 --> 01:33:42.450 region:rollup2
MEMBERS OR EMPLOYEES PAY FOR

01:33:40.615 --> 01:33:43.952 region:rollup2
SETTLEMENTS WOODEN THAT THEN SAY

01:33:42.450 --> 01:33:45.453 region:rollup2
THAT YOU WOULD BASICALLY STOPPED

01:33:43.952 --> 01:33:46.855 region:rollup2
DOING THOSE SORTS OF SETTLEMENTS

01:33:45.453 --> 01:33:48.223 region:rollup2
WERE I KNOW WHAT YOU CALL THEM

01:33:48.223 --> 01:33:50.225 region:rollup2
EVERYONE THE THEY SAY THEY'RE

01:33:49.224 --> 01:33:51.693 region:rollup2

01:33:50.225 --> 01:33:53.495 region:rollup2
PAY THE CLAIM AND YOU'RE

01:33:51.693 --> 01:33:55.663 region:rollup2
SETTLING THE CASE RATHER THAN

01:33:53.495 --> 01:33:57.465 region:rollup2
GOING TO COURT. AND HAVING TO GO

01:33:55.663 --> 01:34:00.168 region:rollup2
THROUGH THE COURT SYSTEM AND

01:33:57.465 --> 01:34:01.603 region:rollup2
THEN RESULTING IN A JUDGMENT HOW

01:34:00.168 --> 01:34:04.072 region:rollup2
DOES.

01:34:01.603 --> 01:34:06.040 region:rollup2
HOW DOES THAT IMPACT?

01:34:04.072 --> 01:34:08.176 region:rollup2
THE DESIRE TO SETTLE VERSUS THE

01:34:06.040 --> 01:34:10.678 region:rollup2
DESIRE DESIRE TO TAKE SOMETHING

01:34:08.176 --> 01:34:12.413 region:rollup2
TO COURT. TO ADJUDICATED IF

01:34:10.678 --> 01:34:15.216 region:rollup2
YOU'RE GOING TO THEN MAKE THE

01:34:12.413 --> 01:34:17.285 region:rollup2
ACCUSED PAGE THAT SETTLEMENT OR

01:34:15.216 --> 01:34:19.220 region:rollup2
MAKE THE RESULT OF A SETTLEMENT

01:34:17.285 --> 01:34:20.622 region:rollup2
PUBLIC EVEN IF. THERE WAS NO

01:34:19.220 --> 01:34:22.257 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATION FINDING SOMEONE TO

01:34:20.622 --> 01:34:23.591 region:rollup2
FALL.

01:34:22.257 --> 01:34:24.559 region:rollup2
WELL IF THIS BODY HAS A

01:34:23.591 --> 01:34:26.895 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR.

01:34:24.559 --> 01:34:28.029 region:rollup2
IS THAT THE RULES RELATING TO

01:34:26.895 --> 01:34:29.797 region:rollup2
PUBLIC SETTLEMENTS ARE ARE

01:34:28.029 --> 01:34:31.332 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT FOR STATE ENTITIES

01:34:29.797 --> 01:34:33.034 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THIS TAXPAYER MONEY.

01:34:31.332 --> 01:34:33.635 region:rollup2
SO THE TAXPAYER HAS A RIGHT TO

01:34:33.034 --> 01:34:34.168 region:rollup2
KNOW WHERE THE MONEY IS BEING

01:34:33.635 --> 01:34:35.937 region:rollup2
SPENT.

01:34:34.168 --> 01:34:37.205 region:rollup2
.

01:34:35.937 --> 01:34:38.973 region:rollup2
I HAVE BEEN REPRESENTING

01:34:37.205 --> 01:34:39.874 region:rollup2
PUBLICAN PLAYS FOR TWENTY YEARS

01:34:38.973 --> 01:34:41.809 region:rollup2
AND.

01:34:39.874 --> 01:34:44.145 region:rollup2
WHEN I AM PRESENTED WITH

01:34:41.809 --> 01:34:45.613 region:rollup2
CONFIDENTIALITY CLAUSES.

01:34:44.145 --> 01:34:48.550 region:rollup2
BUT AS IT RELATES TO THE STATE

01:34:45.613 --> 01:34:51.119 region:rollup2
ENTITY MY RESPONSES THIS A STATE

01:34:48.550 --> 01:34:52.053 region:rollup2
MONEY AND THAT IT TAXPAYER HAS A

01:34:51.119 --> 01:34:53.288 region:rollup2
RIGHT TO KNOW WHERE THAT MONEY

01:34:52.053 --> 01:34:54.956 region:rollup2
IS GOING.

01:34:53.288 --> 01:34:56.591 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S THAT'S ONE THING I

01:34:54.956 --> 01:34:58.393 region:rollup2
THINK THERE ARE SOME LIMITATIONS

01:34:56.591 --> 01:34:59.894 region:rollup2
AS TO WHETHER YOU CAN HAVE.

01:34:58.393 --> 01:35:01.596 region:rollup2
PRIVATE OUR CONFIDENTIALITY

01:34:59.894 --> 01:35:02.764 region:rollup2
CLAUSES AND I AND I QUESTION

01:35:01.596 --> 01:35:04.966 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE PUBLIC POLICY

01:35:02.764 --> 01:35:06.634 region:rollup2
IMPLICATIONS OF ALLOWING SUCH

01:35:04.966 --> 01:35:08.036 region:rollup2
POLICIES TO EXIST I THINK IT'S

01:35:06.634 --> 01:35:10.371 region:rollup2
AGAINST PUBLIC POLICY AND I

01:35:08.036 --> 01:35:12.340 region:rollup2
THINK IT ENCOURAGES. ADDITIONAL

01:35:10.371 --> 01:35:14.075 region:rollup2
UNLAWFUL CONDUCT HAPPEN IF YOU

01:35:12.340 --> 01:35:16.177 region:rollup2
HAVE SECRET SETTLEMENTS.

01:35:14.075 --> 01:35:17.712 region:rollup2
AND GAG CLAUSES THAT'S WHAT

01:35:16.177 --> 01:35:19.681 region:rollup2
ALLOWS THESE THINGS TO FLOURISH

01:35:17.712 --> 01:35:21.416 region:rollup2
AS OPPOSED TO HAVING.

01:35:19.681 --> 01:35:24.018 region:rollup2
.

01:35:21.416 --> 01:35:26.454 region:rollup2
PUB PUBLIC ABOUT THESE SORT OF

01:35:24.018 --> 01:35:28.723 region:rollup2
BY A SETTLEMENT SENATE IN THE

01:35:26.454 --> 01:35:30.225 region:rollup2
SECOND ISSUE BUT JUST.

01:35:28.723 --> 01:35:32.093 region:rollup2
CLARIFY WASN'T IMPLYING THAT THE

01:35:30.225 --> 01:35:33.127 region:rollup2
SETTLEMENTS ARE SECRET.

01:35:32.093 --> 01:35:35.163 region:rollup2
I'M SAYING THAT.

01:35:33.127 --> 01:35:36.664 region:rollup2
THEY'RE DONE WITH SORT OF A NO

01:35:35.163 --> 01:35:38.366 region:rollup2
FAULT CLAUSE SO FROM TYPICALLY A

01:35:36.664 --> 01:35:41.002 region:rollup2
CITY.

01:35:38.366 --> 01:35:42.236 region:rollup2
CONSULT A WORKPLACE CLAIM WITH

01:35:41.002 --> 01:35:43.304 region:rollup2
BY COMING TO AN AGREEMENT WITH

01:35:42.236 --> 01:35:44.539 region:rollup2
AN EMPLOYEE YOU'RE AN EX

01:35:43.304 --> 01:35:45.673 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEE TO PAY A CERTAIN AMOUNT

01:35:44.539 --> 01:35:46.741 region:rollup2
OF MONEY SAYING WE'RE NOT A

01:35:45.673 --> 01:35:48.209 region:rollup2
FAULT WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT WORD

01:35:46.741 --> 01:35:49.210 region:rollup2
FALL BUT WE'RE GOING TO PAY THIS

01:35:48.209 --> 01:35:51.546 region:rollup2
CLAIM BECAUSE IT'S.

01:35:49.210 --> 01:35:53.181 region:rollup2
MORE EX IT'S IT'S ACTUALLY LESS

01:35:51.546 --> 01:35:54.215 region:rollup2
MONEY FOR THE TAXPAYERS TO. PAY

01:35:53.181 --> 01:35:55.683 region:rollup2
TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS

01:35:54.215 --> 01:35:56.217 region:rollup2
THAN TO TAKE IT TO COURT AND WHO

01:35:55.683 --> 01:35:57.685 region:rollup2
KNOWS WHAT'S GONNA END UP

01:35:56.217 --> 01:36:00.121 region:rollup2
HAPPENING.

01:35:57.685 --> 01:36:01.356 region:rollup2
SO I'M WONDER AND AND I'VE

01:36:00.121 --> 01:36:03.291 region:rollup2
NEVER SEEN WITH A SEXUAL

01:36:01.356 --> 01:36:04.859 region:rollup2
HARASSMENT CLAIM. ARM BUT I HAVE

01:36:03.291 --> 01:36:05.927 region:rollup2
SEEN THAT DONE WITH WORKPLACE

01:36:04.859 --> 01:36:08.329 region:rollup2
DISCRIMINATION.

01:36:05.927 --> 01:36:10.331 region:rollup2
CLAIMS BROUGHT TO DEFER

01:36:08.329 --> 01:36:10.898 region:rollup2
MUNICIPALITIES IT'S NOT THAT I'M

01:36:10.331 --> 01:36:11.633 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I MEAN YOU SAW THAT

01:36:10.898 --> 01:36:13.835 region:rollup2
UNCOMMON.

01:36:11.633 --> 01:36:16.271 region:rollup2
SO HOW WOULD THAT IMPACT THAN

01:36:13.835 --> 01:36:18.273 region:rollup2
IF WE'RE GOING TO ASK THE.

01:36:16.271 --> 01:36:20.341 region:rollup2
PERSON WHO IS ACCUSED TO PAY

01:36:18.273 --> 01:36:22.644 region:rollup2
THAT CLAIM.

01:36:20.341 --> 01:36:24.612 region:rollup2
BUT CURRENTLY UNDER THE LAWS. AB

01:36:22.644 --> 01:36:27.081 region:rollup2
IN THE LEGISLATURE OR THAT FOR

01:36:24.612 --> 01:36:28.916 region:rollup2
PUBLIC EMPLOYEES THE INDIVIDUALS

01:36:27.081 --> 01:36:29.550 region:rollup2
INDEMNIFIED UNLESS THEY'VE ACTED

01:36:28.916 --> 01:36:29.751 region:rollup2
OUTSIDE OF THE COURSE AND SCOPE

01:36:29.550 --> 01:36:31.219 region:rollup2
OF THE

01:36:29.751 --> 01:36:33.621 region:rollup2
PLANET.

01:36:31.219 --> 01:36:35.390 region:rollup2
SO AS THE LAW EXISTS TODAY THE

01:36:33.621 --> 01:36:37.425 region:rollup2
STATE DOES NOT HAVE TO PAY FOR

01:36:35.390 --> 01:36:39.193 region:rollup2
EITHER THE DEFENSE OR THE COSTS

01:36:37.425 --> 01:36:40.528 region:rollup2
IF THEY MAKE THE DETERMINATION.

01:36:39.193 --> 01:36:42.030 region:rollup2
THAT THE INDIVIDUALS ACTING

01:36:40.528 --> 01:36:43.031 region:rollup2
OUTSIDE OF THE SCHOOL SCOPING

01:36:42.030 --> 01:36:44.666 region:rollup2
COURSE OF THEIR EMPLOYMENT.

01:36:43.031 --> 01:36:46.467 region:rollup2
YOUNG PLAYERS

01:36:44.666 --> 01:36:48.136 region:rollup2
DO INDEMNIFY AND THERE'S A

01:36:46.467 --> 01:36:50.538 region:rollup2
STRATEGIC REASON FOR IT THEY

01:36:48.136 --> 01:36:52.507 region:rollup2
WANT TO CONTROL. THE HARASSMENT

01:36:50.538 --> 01:36:53.841 region:rollup2
OF THAT THE ALLEGED HARASSER

01:36:52.507 --> 01:36:55.209 region:rollup2
DEFENDANT BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE

01:36:53.841 --> 01:36:56.744 region:rollup2
THAT PERSON.

01:36:55.209 --> 01:36:58.780 region:rollup2
GOING OUT ON THEIR OWN IN AND

01:36:56.744 --> 01:37:00.448 region:rollup2
MAKING STATEMENTS IN THE LAWSUIT

01:36:58.780 --> 01:37:01.949 region:rollup2
THEY COULD SAY I DID IT.

01:37:00.448 --> 01:37:04.218 region:rollup2
ANOTHER'S LIABILITY FOR THE

01:37:01.949 --> 01:37:06.154 region:rollup2
EMPLOYER SO.

01:37:04.218 --> 01:37:07.655 region:rollup2
THAT IS A STRATEGIC DECISION

01:37:06.154 --> 01:37:10.391 region:rollup2
THAT'S NOT A DECISION AS A

01:37:07.655 --> 01:37:13.227 region:rollup2
MATTER OF LAW. THAT IT.

01:37:10.391 --> 01:37:15.663 region:rollup2
THE TOOLS ARE ALREADY THERE

01:37:13.227 --> 01:37:17.699 region:rollup2
THAT ESTATE EMPLOYER CAN DECIDE

01:37:15.663 --> 01:37:19.200 region:rollup2
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO INDEMNIFY.

01:37:17.699 --> 01:37:21.369 region:rollup2
AND THEY'RE NOT GOING TO DEFEND

01:37:19.200 --> 01:37:24.238 region:rollup2
THAT ALREADY EXISTS IT'S JUST

01:37:21.369 --> 01:37:26.541 region:rollup2
THAT. AS A STRATEGY DECISION

01:37:24.238 --> 01:37:29.043 region:rollup2
THEY CHOOSE TO DO SO.

01:37:26.541 --> 01:37:31.245 region:rollup2
ADDITIONALLY IT AS A MATTER OF

01:37:29.043 --> 01:37:32.780 region:rollup2
LAW PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARE NOT

01:37:31.245 --> 01:37:34.515 region:rollup2
PAID BY THE STATE YOU CANNOT

01:37:32.780 --> 01:37:35.116 region:rollup2
OBTAIN PUNITIVE DAMAGES BY THE

01:37:34.515 --> 01:37:36.818 region:rollup2
STATE'S TO EVEN IF YOU CHOOSE

01:37:35.116 --> 01:37:38.619 region:rollup2
TO.

01:37:36.818 --> 01:37:40.922 region:rollup2
INDEMNIFY.

01:37:38.619 --> 01:37:42.590 region:rollup2
UP CORRECT SOMEONE WHO IS FOUND

01:37:40.922 --> 01:37:44.225 region:rollup2
TO HAVE BEEN A HARASSER YOU

01:37:42.590 --> 01:37:45.360 region:rollup2
DON'T PAY THE STATE DOESN'T PAY

01:37:44.225 --> 01:37:46.861 region:rollup2
THOSE PUNITIVE DAMAGES THOSE

01:37:45.360 --> 01:37:47.361 region:rollup2
WOULD HAVE TO COME OUT OF THE

01:37:46.861 --> 01:37:47.995 region:rollup2
POCKET OF THE HARASSER.

01:37:47.361 --> 01:37:51.499 region:rollup2
THINK IT IS.

01:37:47.995 --> 01:37:52.900 region:rollup2
THERE.

01:37:51.499 --> 01:37:53.201 region:rollup2
WELL WOULD MAKE SURE THAT I'M

01:37:52.900 --> 01:37:54.569 region:rollup2
ADDRESSING.

01:37:53.201 --> 01:37:56.537 region:rollup2
.

01:37:54.569 --> 01:37:59.006 region:rollup2
DIRECTLY YOUR QUESTION BECAUSE

01:37:56.537 --> 01:38:02.243 region:rollup2
IT ALSO IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR.

01:37:59.006 --> 01:38:03.244 region:rollup2
THE ACCUSED WHILE EMPLOYED IS

01:38:02.243 --> 01:38:04.979 region:rollup2
AND IS SUBJECT TO

01:38:03.244 --> 01:38:06.214 region:rollup2
INDEMNIFICATION ARE ENTITLED TO

01:38:04.979 --> 01:38:08.483 region:rollup2
INDEMNIFICATION UNDER LABOR CODE

01:38:06.214 --> 01:38:09.984 region:rollup2
TWENTY EIGHT OF TWO. UNTIL THERE

01:38:08.483 --> 01:38:12.620 region:rollup2
IS A DETERMINATION MADE.

01:38:09.984 --> 01:38:14.389 region:rollup2
THAT THE HARASSMENT DID IN FACT

01:38:12.620 --> 01:38:15.790 region:rollup2
OCCUR BECAUSE THAT IS CONSIDER

01:38:14.389 --> 01:38:17.125 region:rollup2
CONDUCT OUTSIDE THE COURSE AND

01:38:15.790 --> 01:38:18.493 region:rollup2
SCOPE OF EMPLOYMENT AND

01:38:17.125 --> 01:38:20.561 region:rollup2
THEREFORE THE EMPLOYER DOES NOT

01:38:18.493 --> 01:38:23.164 region:rollup2
HAVE TO INDEMNIFY.

01:38:20.561 --> 01:38:25.566 region:rollup2
AS FOR THE MOTIVATION FOR

01:38:23.164 --> 01:38:28.236 region:rollup2
EMPLOYERS ENSURING INTO PRIVATE

01:38:25.566 --> 01:38:30.304 region:rollup2
SETTLEMENTS IN LIEU OF

01:38:28.236 --> 01:38:31.973 region:rollup2
PROTRACTED LITIGATION.

01:38:30.304 --> 01:38:34.008 region:rollup2
A THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT

01:38:31.973 --> 01:38:36.210 region:rollup2
MOTIVATIONS FOR THAT ONE OF

01:38:34.008 --> 01:38:39.680 region:rollup2
WHICH COULD BE THE PURE COST AND

01:38:36.210 --> 01:38:41.649 region:rollup2
TIME INVOLVED IN. A LITIGATION

01:38:39.680 --> 01:38:43.751 region:rollup2
OUR COURTS ARE VERY IMPACTED

01:38:41.649 --> 01:38:47.188 region:rollup2
THESE CASES GO ON FOR YEARS AND

01:38:43.751 --> 01:38:47.422 region:rollup2
IF IN FACT YOU DO END UP.

01:38:47.188 --> 01:38:49.423 region:rollup2
ALWAYS.

01:38:47.422 --> 01:38:51.559 region:rollup2
SURE.

01:38:49.423 --> 01:38:53.561 region:rollup2
THAT JURY IS GOING TO BE AND

01:38:51.559 --> 01:38:54.862 region:rollup2
WHAT THE RISK AS A OTHER

01:38:53.561 --> 01:38:57.632 region:rollup2
MOTIVATIONS ARE.

01:38:54.862 --> 01:39:01.002 region:rollup2
WE IN FACT NEED TO RESOLVE THIS

01:38:57.632 --> 01:39:02.737 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THIS IS BAD. RIGHT THEY

01:39:01.002 --> 01:39:05.406 region:rollup2
SHOULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED WE

01:39:02.737 --> 01:39:06.908 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE. LEGITIMATE DEFENSES

01:39:05.406 --> 01:39:08.376 region:rollup2
TAKING THIS TO TRIAL SO WE

01:39:06.908 --> 01:39:10.311 region:rollup2
SHOULD GET IT RESOLVED TO THEIR

01:39:08.376 --> 01:39:11.779 region:rollup2
MANY DIFFERENT REASONS.

01:39:10.311 --> 01:39:14.148 region:rollup2
BUT OFTEN TIMES.

01:39:11.779 --> 01:39:16.851 region:rollup2
I BELIEVE AND WHAT YOU WERE

01:39:14.148 --> 01:39:18.920 region:rollup2
REFERRING TO. AND CHAIRWOMAN WAS

01:39:16.851 --> 01:39:19.754 region:rollup2
JUST THE DECISION TO HAVE A

01:39:18.920 --> 01:39:21.022 region:rollup2
SETTLEMENT WITH THE NON

01:39:19.754 --> 01:39:22.123 region:rollup2
ADMISSION BECAUSE TO GET THIS

01:39:21.022 --> 01:39:23.691 region:rollup2
PUT BEHIND US

01:39:22.123 --> 01:39:27.028 region:rollup2
AND SO IF WE ENTER INTO THESE

01:39:23.691 --> 01:39:29.430 region:rollup2
BUT YET WE TURN AROUND. AND WE.

01:39:27.028 --> 01:39:30.565 region:rollup2
PUBLICIZING MAHLER DISCLOSE THEM

01:39:29.430 --> 01:39:31.132 region:rollup2

THE. TO THE PUBLIC HOW DOES

01:39:31.132 --> 01:39:35.703 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:39:33.534 --> 01:39:37.305 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THAT HELP IN ANYWAY

01:39:35.703 --> 01:39:39.340 region:rollup2
VERSE IS JUST GOING TO TRIAL AND

01:39:37.305 --> 01:39:41.042 region:rollup2
IT BEING PUBLIC AND I THINK

01:39:39.340 --> 01:39:43.477 region:rollup2
YOU'VE GOT TO DETERMINE. WHAT

01:39:41.042 --> 01:39:44.545 region:rollup2
ARE THE REASONS WHY AN EARLY

01:39:43.477 --> 01:39:47.849 region:rollup2
SETTLEMENT IS BETTER THAN A

01:39:44.545 --> 01:39:49.083 region:rollup2
PROTRACTED LITIGATION TO?

01:39:47.849 --> 01:39:50.017 region:rollup2
PASSED FOR PATIENTS FOR MY

THANK YOU FOR TAKING ME A LITTLE

01:40:41.168 --> 01:40:46.140 region:rollup2

NAME IS ANN RAVEL AND I'M THE

01:40:46.140 --> 01:40:49.911 region:rollup2
FORMER CHAIR OF THE CALIFORNIA

01:40:48.576 --> 01:40:53.014 region:rollup2
FAIR POLITICAL PRACTICES

01:40:49.911 --> 01:40:55.683 region:rollup2
COMMISSION AS WELL AS THE.

01:40:53.014 --> 01:40:56.117 region:rollup2
OF FEDERAL ELECTION COMMISSION.

01:40:55.683 --> 01:41:00.688 region:rollup2
AND.

01:40:56.117 --> 01:41:03.758 region:rollup2
FIRE HERE BUT NOT TO SPEAK

01:41:00.688 --> 01:41:05.092 region:rollup2
ABOUT. SEXUAL HARASSMENT PER SE

01:41:03.758 --> 01:41:07.962 region:rollup2
BUT TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE

01:41:05.092 --> 01:41:09.931 region:rollup2
ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED.

01:41:07.962 --> 01:41:12.099 region:rollup2
OF RELATING TO THE ENFORCEMENT

01:41:09.931 --> 01:41:14.902 region:rollup2
OF MATTERS AGAINST

01:41:12.099 --> 01:41:15.069 region:rollup2
PUBLIC OFFICIALS

01:41:14.902 --> 01:41:17.305 region:rollup2
AND.

01:41:15.069 --> 01:41:20.107 region:rollup2
I.

01:41:17.305 --> 01:41:22.009 region:rollup2
FRANKLY BELIEVE. THAT. AND I

01:41:20.107 --> 01:41:23.244 region:rollup2
HAVE DONE SEXUAL HARASSMENT WORK

01:41:22.009 --> 01:41:24.912 region:rollup2
WHEN I WAS A LAWYER FOR THE

01:41:23.244 --> 01:41:27.782 region:rollup2
COUNTY.

01:41:24.912 --> 01:41:30.451 region:rollup2
BUT I DO THINK THAT.

01:41:27.782 --> 01:41:32.453 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATURE IS UNIQUE.

01:41:30.451 --> 01:41:35.089 region:rollup2
AND THAT HOW TO ADDRESS THESE

01:41:32.453 --> 01:41:36.791 region:rollup2
ISSUES. IS A LITTLE MORE

01:41:35.089 --> 01:41:38.793 region:rollup2
COMPLICATED THAN.

01:41:36.791 --> 01:41:40.761 region:rollup2
AS A REGULAR EMPLOYEE.

01:41:38.793 --> 01:41:42.296 region:rollup2
AND FOR THE REASONS THAT HAVE

01:41:40.761 --> 01:41:45.399 region:rollup2
BEEN RAISED.

01:41:42.296 --> 01:41:46.667 region:rollup2
MANY OF THEM BECAUSE.

01:41:45.399 --> 01:41:49.036 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY THE.

01:41:46.667 --> 01:41:50.771 region:rollup2
DESIRE.

01:41:49.036 --> 01:41:52.440 region:rollup2
TO PROTECT THE VICTIM OR THE

01:41:50.771 --> 01:41:54.675 region:rollup2
ALLEGED VICTIM.

01:41:52.440 --> 01:41:57.678 region:rollup2
UP AND TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS A

01:41:54.675 --> 01:42:01.248 region:rollup2
PAPER FAIR PROCESS IS THE SAME.

01:41:57.678 --> 01:42:02.516 region:rollup2
NO MATTER WHAT. BUT.

01:42:01.248 --> 01:42:03.618 region:rollup2
THERE IS UNIQUE.

01:42:02.516 --> 01:42:05.920 region:rollup2
ASPECTS.

01:42:03.618 --> 01:42:07.622 region:rollup2
OF.

01:42:05.920 --> 01:42:09.523 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS WHO IN A POLITICAL

01:42:07.622 --> 01:42:12.426 region:rollup2
POSITION.

01:42:09.523 --> 01:42:15.262 region:rollup2
AND HOW AND.

01:42:12.426 --> 01:42:17.732 region:rollup2
PRESS AND OTHER AND INFORMATION

01:42:15.262 --> 01:42:19.667 region:rollup2
THAT COMES OUT IS BEING USED.

01:42:17.732 --> 01:42:21.569 region:rollup2
AGAINST THEM. AND FOR THAT

01:42:19.667 --> 01:42:24.438 region:rollup2
REASON I THINK YOU HAVE TO LOOK

01:42:21.569 --> 01:42:26.073 region:rollup2
AT. AND THIS IS I THINK WHY I'VE

01:42:24.438 --> 01:42:27.875 region:rollup2
BEEN ASKED TO SPEAK.

01:42:26.073 --> 01:42:29.944 region:rollup2
I THINK YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT WHAT

01:42:27.875 --> 01:42:31.545 region:rollup2
MIGHT BE.

01:42:29.944 --> 01:42:35.082 region:rollup2
A BETTER PROCESS.

01:42:31.545 --> 01:42:38.019 region:rollup2
RATHER THAN A REGULAR.

01:42:35.082 --> 01:42:40.021 region:rollup2
EMPLOYERS WHO MIGHT HAVE AN

01:42:38.019 --> 01:42:41.589 region:rollup2
INTERNAL PROCESS.

01:42:40.021 --> 01:42:43.290 region:rollup2
SO I AND EXCUSE ME IF YOU.

01:42:41.589 --> 01:42:45.359 region:rollup2
.

01:42:43.290 --> 01:42:47.695 region:rollup2
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THERE'S A

01:42:45.359 --> 01:42:48.763 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF WAYS TO LOOK AT AT

01:42:47.695 --> 01:42:50.731 region:rollup2
THESE COMPLAINTS.

01:42:48.763 --> 01:42:52.333 region:rollup2
BOTTOM.

01:42:50.731 --> 01:42:53.668 region:rollup2
ONE OF THEM IS JUST HIRE AN

01:42:52.333 --> 01:42:54.869 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATOR A LAWYER WHICH I

01:42:53.668 --> 01:42:57.705 region:rollup2
THINK.

01:42:54.869 --> 01:42:58.906 region:rollup2
PEOPLE HAVE REFERRED TO TODAY

01:42:57.705 --> 01:43:00.641 region:rollup2
I'M WHICH I DO NOT THINK IS

01:42:58.906 --> 01:43:04.512 region:rollup2
PROBABLY THE BEST.

01:43:00.641 --> 01:43:06.180 region:rollup2
WAY UP AND THERE'S ALSO. A

01:43:04.512 --> 01:43:09.083 region:rollup2
HIDDEN SOMEBODY'S.

01:43:06.180 --> 01:43:11.619 region:rollup2
HAVE A SPECIFIC INDIVIDUAL LIKE

01:43:09.083 --> 01:43:13.621 region:rollup2
AND I. AYE G..

01:43:11.619 --> 01:43:15.356 region:rollup2
WHO WOULD BE THE PERSON? TO

01:43:13.621 --> 01:43:18.125 region:rollup2
OVERSEE AN INVESTIGATOR OR DO

01:43:15.356 --> 01:43:20.461 region:rollup2
THE INVESTIGATION THEMSELVES. IN

01:43:18.125 --> 01:43:25.466 region:rollup2
A SEPARATE BODY I'M SORRY AND

01:43:20.461 --> 01:43:25.633 region:rollup2
INSPECTOR GENERAL.

01:43:25.466 --> 01:43:28.035 region:rollup2
AND.

01:43:25.633 --> 01:43:28.602 region:rollup2
.

01:43:28.035 --> 01:43:32.273 region:rollup2
SOME COMMISSIONS LIKE THE F.

01:43:28.602 --> 01:43:34.675 region:rollup2
PPC.

01:43:32.273 --> 01:43:36.077 region:rollup2
OF ACTUALLY IN OTHER STATES

01:43:34.675 --> 01:43:37.845 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY ONLY HAVE ONE

01:43:36.077 --> 01:43:39.613 region:rollup2
COMMISSIONER.

01:43:37.845 --> 01:43:41.315 region:rollup2
AND DIDN'T BESSIE GATORS.

01:43:39.613 --> 01:43:44.185 region:rollup2
BUT.

01:43:41.315 --> 01:43:46.087 region:rollup2
FRANKLY HAVING SEEN BOTH THE

01:43:44.185 --> 01:43:47.254 region:rollup2
FEDERAL ELECTION COMMISSION AND

01:43:46.087 --> 01:43:49.590 region:rollup2
THE CALIFORNIA FAIR POLITICAL

01:43:47.254 --> 01:43:53.127 region:rollup2
PRACTICES COMMISSION.

01:43:49.590 --> 01:43:55.830 region:rollup2
MY VIEW IS THAT THAT IS.

01:43:53.127 --> 01:43:58.733 region:rollup2
A REALLY GOOD MECHANISM.

01:43:55.830 --> 01:44:01.602 region:rollup2
FOR REVIEWING COMPLAINTS AGAINST

01:43:58.733 --> 01:44:03.304 region:rollup2
ELECTED OFFICIALS WHETHER IT BE.

01:44:01.602 --> 01:44:04.605 region:rollup2
FOR OTHER.

01:44:03.304 --> 01:44:07.274 region:rollup2
VIOLATIONS OF THE POLITICAL

01:44:04.605 --> 01:44:10.010 region:rollup2
REFORM ACT IS THAT IS.

01:44:07.274 --> 01:44:13.314 region:rollup2
OR. ETHICS VIOLATIONS WHICH THE

01:44:10.010 --> 01:44:15.316 region:rollup2
FPC ALSO HAS AUTHORITY OVER.

01:44:13.314 --> 01:44:17.118 region:rollup2
OR SOMETHING LIKE THIS I'M AND

01:44:15.316 --> 01:44:17.418 region:rollup2
THE REASON FOR THAT IS. IF YOU

01:44:17.118 --> 01:44:19.186 region:rollup2
LOOK AT IT.

01:44:17.418 --> 01:44:21.122 region:rollup2
.

01:44:19.186 --> 01:44:24.225 region:rollup2
THE COMPANY COMPOSITION OF THE

01:44:21.122 --> 01:44:26.160 region:rollup2
F. PPC. IT IS SPECIFICALLY

01:44:24.225 --> 01:44:28.462 region:rollup2
BIPARTISAN.

01:44:26.160 --> 01:44:32.366 region:rollup2
AND IT IS INTENDED TO BE

01:44:28.462 --> 01:44:34.401 region:rollup2
NONPARTISAN. AND YOU KNOW I.

01:44:32.366 --> 01:44:36.537 region:rollup2
THIS IS NOT WASHINGTON DC I

01:44:34.401 --> 01:44:39.340 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND THAT HAPPY TO BE BACK

01:44:36.537 --> 01:44:42.843 region:rollup2
IN CALIFORNIA WHERE IT IS NOT.

01:44:39.340 --> 01:44:45.312 region:rollup2
BUT. BURDEN. NONE THE LESS

01:44:42.843 --> 01:44:47.715 region:rollup2
THERE ARE POLITICAL ASPECTS.

01:44:45.312 --> 01:44:49.283 region:rollup2
TO THESE ISSUES NO QUESTION

01:44:47.715 --> 01:44:51.552 region:rollup2
ABOUT IT.

01:44:49.283 --> 01:44:54.989 region:rollup2
SO HAVING A BIPARTISAN

01:44:51.552 --> 01:44:56.991 region:rollup2
COMMISSION. IS A REALLY. GOOD

01:44:54.989 --> 01:45:00.027 region:rollup2
ALTERNATIVE.

01:44:56.991 --> 01:45:02.630 region:rollup2
TO HAVING ONE PERSON WHO MAY BE

01:45:00.027 --> 01:45:04.465 region:rollup2
APPOINTED BY SOMEBODY. OF ONE

01:45:02.630 --> 01:45:08.669 region:rollup2
PARTY OR ANOTHER.

01:45:04.465 --> 01:45:11.071 region:rollup2
I'M. IT THE. SUDDEN OTHER.

01:45:08.669 --> 01:45:12.773 region:rollup2
ASPECT OF IT IS THAT BECAUSE

01:45:11.071 --> 01:45:14.775 region:rollup2
THOSE COMMISSIONS ARE TOTALLY

01:45:12.773 --> 01:45:17.478 region:rollup2
INDEPENDENT.

01:45:14.775 --> 01:45:19.547 region:rollup2
AND ACT IN DEPENDENTLY DO NOT

01:45:17.478 --> 01:45:21.182 region:rollup2
REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE PER SE

01:45:19.547 --> 01:45:22.750 region:rollup2
EXCEPT.

01:45:21.182 --> 01:45:25.386 region:rollup2
INSOFAR AS THEY HAVE

01:45:22.750 --> 01:45:27.655 region:rollup2
RELATIONSHIPS AND THEY SHOULD.

01:45:25.386 --> 01:45:29.356 region:rollup2
TO DO TRAINING TO TO.

01:45:27.655 --> 01:45:31.926 region:rollup2
.

01:45:29.356 --> 01:45:34.662 region:rollup2
TRY TO CHANGE THE CULTURE AS YOU

01:45:31.926 --> 01:45:36.430 region:rollup2
SPOKE ABOUT. A AND TO GET

01:45:34.662 --> 01:45:38.632 region:rollup2
COMPLIANCE

01:45:36.430 --> 01:45:41.402 region:rollup2
AHEAD OF TIME RATHER THAN

01:45:38.632 --> 01:45:44.271 region:rollup2
FOCUSING SOLELY ON.

01:45:41.402 --> 01:45:46.540 region:rollup2
PUNISHMENT AND WELL OF COURSE

01:45:44.271 --> 01:45:48.842 region:rollup2
THERE'S THAT THAT WHOLE TIMIDLY

01:45:46.540 --> 01:45:49.543 region:rollup2
HAS TO TAKE PLACE IS WELL WE

01:45:48.842 --> 01:45:51.545 region:rollup2
ENFORCEMENT OF THE LAW.

01:45:49.543 --> 01:45:53.581 region:rollup2
BUT.

01:45:51.545 --> 01:45:55.282 region:rollup2
REALLY WITH THOSE KINDS OF

01:45:53.581 --> 01:45:58.152 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATIONS.

01:45:55.282 --> 01:46:00.754 region:rollup2
TENDS TO SEE THEIR ROLE.

01:45:58.152 --> 01:46:02.590 region:rollup2
IN MANY WAYS AS.

01:46:00.754 --> 01:46:04.959 region:rollup2
TRYING TO WORK WITH THE BODY

01:46:02.590 --> 01:46:06.727 region:rollup2
THAT THEY ARE THERE TO OVERSEE

01:46:04.959 --> 01:46:08.996 region:rollup2
IN THE SENSE.

01:46:06.727 --> 01:46:10.898 region:rollup2
TO GET.

01:46:08.996 --> 01:46:14.235 region:rollup2
VOLUNTARY COMPLIANCE TO CHANGE

01:46:10.898 --> 01:46:17.271 region:rollup2
THE CULTURE SO THAT IT'S NOT.

01:46:14.235 --> 01:46:20.507 region:rollup2
PURELY PUNITIVE BUT IT IS UP.

01:46:17.271 --> 01:46:22.576 region:rollup2
EDUCATION. AND ABOUT HOW TO HOW

01:46:20.507 --> 01:46:24.078 region:rollup2
THEY INTERACT.

01:46:22.576 --> 01:46:27.281 region:rollup2
PURSUANT TO THE LAW.

01:46:24.078 --> 01:46:28.849 region:rollup2
SO THIS IS WHY. IN SOME WAYS I

01:46:27.281 --> 01:46:31.352 region:rollup2
THINK.

01:46:28.849 --> 01:46:32.219 region:rollup2
THAT MODEL IS A GOOD ONE AND FOR

01:46:31.352 --> 01:46:33.787 region:rollup2
THOSE OF YOU WHO DON'T KNOW I

01:46:32.219 --> 01:46:35.456 region:rollup2
MEAN.

01:46:33.787 --> 01:46:36.924 region:rollup2
AND THEY'RE PROBABLY LOTS OF

01:46:35.456 --> 01:46:39.059 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT WAYS OF SETTING IT UP.

01:46:36.924 --> 01:46:41.028 region:rollup2
ON LEGISLATIVELY IF YOU WERE

01:46:39.059 --> 01:46:43.030 region:rollup2
GOING TO. PURSUE SOMETHING LIKE

01:46:41.028 --> 01:46:44.331 region:rollup2
THIS BUT THE F. PPC THE

01:46:43.030 --> 01:46:46.200 region:rollup2
APPOINTMENTS.

01:46:44.331 --> 01:46:49.603 region:rollup2
ARE.

01:46:46.200 --> 01:46:52.339 region:rollup2
EACH CONSTITUTIONAL OFFICER.

01:46:49.603 --> 01:46:55.442 region:rollup2
HAS IT BEEN APPOINTMENT.

01:46:52.339 --> 01:46:57.211 region:rollup2
UP AND AND IF THERE ARE AS IN

01:46:55.442 --> 01:46:59.380 region:rollup2
THE CASE OF CALIFORNIA.

01:46:57.211 --> 01:47:00.814 region:rollup2
ONLY ONE PARTY S. CONSTITUTIONAL

01:46:59.380 --> 01:47:02.917 region:rollup2
OFFICERS

01:47:00.814 --> 01:47:05.853 region:rollup2
THEN SOME OF THE APPOINTMENTS

01:47:02.917 --> 01:47:08.989 region:rollup2
MUST BE MADE UP AND IN THIS CASE

01:47:05.853 --> 01:47:11.825 region:rollup2
UP BY THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.

01:47:08.989 --> 01:47:14.828 region:rollup2
UP AND AND THAT.

01:47:11.825 --> 01:47:17.064 region:rollup2
PROVIDES THAT BALANCE AND THAT

01:47:14.828 --> 01:47:18.432 region:rollup2
SORT OF CHECK. ON THE AUTHORITY

01:47:17.064 --> 01:47:20.501 region:rollup2
OF THE COMMISSION.

01:47:18.432 --> 01:47:23.237 region:rollup2
WHICH THEN.

01:47:20.501 --> 01:47:26.807 region:rollup2
OVERSEAS BE INVESTIGATORS WITHIN

01:47:23.237 --> 01:47:30.811 region:rollup2
THE WITHIN THE AGENCY. OF.

01:47:26.807 --> 01:47:33.147 region:rollup2
SO BAD INDEPENDENCE I THINK IS.

01:47:30.811 --> 01:47:36.116 region:rollup2
A REALLY GOOD THING BECAUSE WHAT

01:47:33.147 --> 01:47:41.388 region:rollup2
IT DOES IS IT.

01:47:36.116 --> 01:47:43.891 region:rollup2
REQUIRES UNLIKE THE A FDC. WHERE

01:47:41.388 --> 01:47:46.593 region:rollup2
IT WAS A BODY OF SIX?

01:47:43.891 --> 01:47:48.562 region:rollup2
AND A THE ESSENTIAL APPOINTEES

01:47:46.593 --> 01:47:50.965 region:rollup2
WERE EITHER THE MAJORITY LEADER

01:47:48.562 --> 01:47:52.099 region:rollup2
OR THE. MINORITY LEADER OF THE

01:47:50.965 --> 01:47:53.901 region:rollup2
SENATE.

01:47:52.099 --> 01:47:57.137 region:rollup2
AND.

01:47:53.901 --> 01:47:59.173 region:rollup2
AS A RESULT THERE WAS.

01:47:57.137 --> 01:48:00.040 region:rollup2
SOME SENATE'S.

01:47:59.173 --> 01:48:01.942 region:rollup2
ABED.

01:48:00.040 --> 01:48:03.344 region:rollup2
THEY WERE BEHOLDEN TO THOSE

01:48:01.942 --> 01:48:06.046 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS

01:48:03.344 --> 01:48:08.082 region:rollup2
SO THEY ESSENTIALLY BECAME MUCH

01:48:06.046 --> 01:48:09.316 region:rollup2
MORE POLITICAL AND I THINK YOU.

01:48:08.082 --> 01:48:11.518 region:rollup2
RENDON VIEW.

01:48:09.316 --> 01:48:14.521 region:rollup2
MY REPORT THAT I WROTE BEFORE

01:48:11.518 --> 01:48:17.291 region:rollup2
WHEN I LEFT THE FEC AND IT.

01:48:14.521 --> 01:48:19.159 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY HAD AN IMPACT IN

01:48:17.291 --> 01:48:22.062 region:rollup2
ENFORCEMENT.

01:48:19.159 --> 01:48:23.864 region:rollup2
AT THE FTC. BUT.

01:48:22.062 --> 01:48:25.265 region:rollup2
BE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT HAVE

01:48:23.864 --> 01:48:27.701 region:rollup2
BEEN SPOKEN ABOUT BY THE

01:48:25.265 --> 01:48:30.137 region:rollup2
PREVIOUS PANEL. ARE ALSO REALLY

01:48:27.701 --> 01:48:31.672 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT BECAUSE CLEARLY.

01:48:30.137 --> 01:48:34.108 region:rollup2
THE ABILITY OF SUCH AN

01:48:31.672 --> 01:48:36.377 region:rollup2
INDEPENDENT COMMISSION TO ACT.

01:48:34.108 --> 01:48:39.380 region:rollup2
IS ALSO DEPENDENT ON THE FACT

01:48:36.377 --> 01:48:42.282 region:rollup2
THAT THEY ARE PROVIDED AMPLE

01:48:39.380 --> 01:48:44.084 region:rollup2
BUDGET. TO DO SO.

01:48:42.282 --> 01:48:45.986 region:rollup2
UN AND HEAD.

01:48:44.084 --> 01:48:47.354 region:rollup2
AND.

01:48:45.986 --> 01:48:51.025 region:rollup2
IN MANY.

01:48:47.354 --> 01:48:54.328 region:rollup2
COMMISSIONS NATIONWIDE UP AND

01:48:51.025 --> 01:48:57.931 region:rollup2
HOW THE. LEGISLATURE OVER OR

01:48:54.328 --> 01:49:00.868 region:rollup2
LOCAL. GOVERNMENT UP MANAGES TO

01:48:57.931 --> 01:49:02.970 region:rollup2
ASSURE THAT THERE IS NO ACTUAL.

01:49:00.868 --> 01:49:04.938 region:rollup2
ITEM FAIR ACTIVITY OF THOSE

01:49:02.970 --> 01:49:07.107 region:rollup2
COMMISSIONS IS THAT THEY ARE

01:49:04.938 --> 01:49:09.943 region:rollup2
STARVED FOR RESOURCES.

01:49:07.107 --> 01:49:12.379 region:rollup2
SO RESOURCES ARE REALLY

01:49:09.943 --> 01:49:14.248 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT FOR BOTH ASPECTS BOTH

01:49:12.379 --> 01:49:15.883 region:rollup2
FOR THE EDUCATION.

01:49:14.248 --> 01:49:18.152 region:rollup2
THE ADVICE

01:49:15.883 --> 01:49:21.155 region:rollup2
ASPECT WHICH SHOULD BE A

01:49:18.152 --> 01:49:22.222 region:rollup2
COMPONENT OF IT. BUT ALSO FOR

01:49:21.155 --> 01:49:24.258 region:rollup2
THE ENFORCEMENT AND

01:49:22.222 --> 01:49:24.992 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATION ASPECT IT'S REALLY

01:49:24.258 --> 01:49:26.727 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT THAT THERE BE

01:49:24.992 --> 01:49:27.995 region:rollup2
SUFFICIENT.

01:49:26.727 --> 01:49:29.897 region:rollup2
OF RESOURCES.

01:49:27.995 --> 01:49:32.866 region:rollup2
.

01:49:29.897 --> 01:49:36.470 region:rollup2
SO A. THE OTHER THE OTHER THING

01:49:32.866 --> 01:49:39.940 region:rollup2
IS I'M AS IS TRUE OF THE PPC.

01:49:36.470 --> 01:49:42.776 region:rollup2
THE THE COMMISSIONERS CAN'T BE

01:49:39.940 --> 01:49:45.012 region:rollup2
REMOVED DURING THEIR TERMS.

01:49:42.776 --> 01:49:48.015 region:rollup2
SO IT THERE CAN'T BE ANY

01:49:45.012 --> 01:49:51.518 region:rollup2
RETALIATION OR ANY ANY.

01:49:48.015 --> 01:49:53.720 region:rollup2
ACTIONS IF PEOPLE DO NOT AGREE

01:49:51.518 --> 01:49:54.955 region:rollup2
WITH THEIR WITH THEIR ACTIONS

01:49:53.720 --> 01:49:56.690 region:rollup2
WITH REGARD TO THE

01:49:54.955 --> 01:49:58.192 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATIONS AND I THAT DO

01:49:56.690 --> 01:50:01.462 region:rollup2
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT.

01:49:58.192 --> 01:50:04.231 region:rollup2
TO HAVE INVESTIGATORS THAT BEEN.

01:50:01.462 --> 01:50:06.700 region:rollup2
OF MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE

01:50:04.231 --> 01:50:09.470 region:rollup2
COMMISSIONERS. A AND I

01:50:06.700 --> 01:50:11.371 region:rollup2
ABSOLUTELY AGREE THEY HAVE TO BE

01:50:09.470 --> 01:50:14.208 region:rollup2
TIME TIMELY I SPIT THINK THAT'S

01:50:11.371 --> 01:50:15.809 region:rollup2
BEEN SAID BEFORE. BUT THAT IS

01:50:14.208 --> 01:50:18.679 region:rollup2
REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT NO

01:50:15.809 --> 01:50:21.315 region:rollup2
MATTER WHAT. THE CONTEXT.

01:50:18.679 --> 01:50:23.016 region:rollup2
BUT IN PARTICULAR IN SEXUAL

01:50:21.315 --> 01:50:24.952 region:rollup2
HARASSMENT MATTERS IT THEY.

01:50:23.016 --> 01:50:26.787 region:rollup2
MUST BE TIMELY AND I WOULD

01:50:24.952 --> 01:50:28.989 region:rollup2
SUGGEST.

01:50:26.787 --> 01:50:31.725 region:rollup2
BUT ANY RULES RELATING TO SUCH A

01:50:28.989 --> 01:50:33.327 region:rollup2
COMMISSION WOULD HAVE TARGETS.

01:50:31.725 --> 01:50:35.963 region:rollup2
FOR FOR TIMELINES NOT

01:50:33.327 --> 01:50:37.297 region:rollup2
NECESSARILY. REQUIRING THEM

01:50:35.963 --> 01:50:38.966 region:rollup2
BECAUSE SOME THINGS ARE MORE

01:50:37.297 --> 01:50:41.201 region:rollup2
COMPLEX THAN OTHERS.

01:50:38.966 --> 01:50:43.403 region:rollup2
BUT TIME OF TARGETS ARE REALLY

01:50:41.201 --> 01:50:45.506 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT BOTH FOR THE VICTIMS

01:50:43.403 --> 01:50:47.975 region:rollup2
AS WELL AS THE CUES.

01:50:45.506 --> 01:50:50.177 region:rollup2
AND I ALSO THINK THAT THE

01:50:47.975 --> 01:50:51.879 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATIVE PROCESS ITSELF AND

01:50:50.177 --> 01:50:54.014 region:rollup2
I MAY DIFFER FOR THEM.

01:50:51.879 --> 01:50:59.786 region:rollup2
WHAT SOME OF THE OTHERS ON THE?

01:50:54.014 --> 01:51:00.654 region:rollup2
PANEL. PRIOR TO. HAVE SAID OF.

01:50:59.786 --> 01:51:03.490 region:rollup2
I BELIEVE THAT THE INVESTIGATIVE

01:51:00.654 --> 01:51:05.259 region:rollup2
PROCESS SHOULD BE.

01:51:03.490 --> 01:51:07.661 region:rollup2
TOTALLY CONFIDENTIAL.

01:51:05.259 --> 01:51:10.631 region:rollup2
AND I. DO NOT THINK

01:51:07.661 --> 01:51:12.065 region:rollup2
THAT UNLESS THERE IS.

01:51:10.631 --> 01:51:15.802 region:rollup2
OF FINDING

01:51:12.065 --> 01:51:17.538 region:rollup2
THAT THERE IS A. VALID.

01:51:15.802 --> 01:51:19.339 region:rollup2
BELIEF OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT

01:51:17.538 --> 01:51:21.408 region:rollup2
OCCURRED.

01:51:19.339 --> 01:51:23.010 region:rollup2
THAT THERE SHOULD BE PUBLICITY

01:51:21.408 --> 01:51:24.945 region:rollup2
SURROUNDING AND I THINK THAT IT

01:51:23.010 --> 01:51:26.980 region:rollup2
IS.

01:51:24.945 --> 01:51:28.782 region:rollup2
SO IMPORTANT AND I SAW THIS AT

01:51:26.980 --> 01:51:31.318 region:rollup2
THE AT PPC.

01:51:28.782 --> 01:51:33.186 region:rollup2
JUST BE ALLEGATION.

01:51:31.318 --> 01:51:34.922 region:rollup2
JUST THIS STATEMENT JUST A

01:51:33.186 --> 01:51:36.957 region:rollup2
COMPLAINT BEING FILED AND YOU

01:51:34.922 --> 01:51:37.424 region:rollup2
CAN'T STOP PEOPLE FROM.

01:51:36.957 --> 01:51:39.593 region:rollup2
PUBLICIZING THEIR OWN

01:51:37.424 --> 01:51:41.995 region:rollup2
COMPLAINTS.

01:51:39.593 --> 01:51:44.932 region:rollup2
BUT JUST THAT COMPLAINT.

01:51:41.995 --> 01:51:49.002 region:rollup2
IS ENOUGH FOR PEOPLE TO.

01:51:44.932 --> 01:51:51.038 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN ADVERSE VIEW. OF THE

01:51:49.002 --> 01:51:55.142 region:rollup2
PERSON WHO IS BEING COMPLAINED

01:51:51.038 --> 01:51:58.579 region:rollup2
AGAINST AND THAT IT I THINK. YOU

01:51:55.142 --> 01:51:59.680 region:rollup2
SAID OF WE KNOW THAT'S ON THE

01:51:58.579 --> 01:52:02.015 region:rollup2
FRONT PAGE.

01:51:59.680 --> 01:52:04.184 region:rollup2
BUT THE SACRAMENTO BEE OR

01:52:02.015 --> 01:52:06.653 region:rollup2
WHATEVER HOMETOWN NEWSPAPER. AND

01:52:04.184 --> 01:52:08.188 region:rollup2
THEN THE DECISION.

01:52:06.653 --> 01:52:09.756 region:rollup2
WHERE NOTHING IN NOTHING IS

01:52:08.188 --> 01:52:12.092 region:rollup2
PROVEN?

01:52:09.756 --> 01:52:14.428 region:rollup2
IT IS USUALLY HIDDEN SOMEWHERE

01:52:12.092 --> 01:52:14.928 region:rollup2
IN ONE PARAGRAPH OR MAYBE NOT AT

01:52:14.428 --> 01:52:18.932 region:rollup2
ALL. AND SO I I DO HAVE

01:52:14.928 --> 01:52:21.368 region:rollup2
CONCERNS.

01:52:18.932 --> 01:52:24.004 region:rollup2
ABOUT HAVING PUBLICITY AND I AM

01:52:21.368 --> 01:52:24.571 region:rollup2
A. BIG BELIEVER IN GOVERNMENT

01:52:24.004 --> 01:52:28.041 region:rollup2
TRANSPARENCY WITHOUT A DOUBT

01:52:24.571 --> 01:52:31.144 region:rollup2
BUT.

01:52:28.041 --> 01:52:33.080 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES THESE CASES.

01:52:31.144 --> 01:52:35.916 region:rollup2
CAN HAVE.

01:52:33.080 --> 01:52:37.517 region:rollup2
CONSEQUENCES THE BETTER REALLY

01:52:35.916 --> 01:52:39.386 region:rollup2
UNFAIR AND I THINK THAT THE

01:52:37.517 --> 01:52:40.854 region:rollup2
PROCESS.

01:52:39.386 --> 01:52:41.855 region:rollup2
BUT IT LET ME JUST SAY AND I

01:52:40.854 --> 01:52:43.390 region:rollup2
THINK I MENTIONED THIS.

01:52:41.855 --> 01:52:43.991 region:rollup2
TEARS STAFF.

01:52:43.390 --> 01:52:53.367 region:rollup2
WHEN A LISTING ON THE WEBSITE.

01:52:43.991 --> 01:52:54.868 region:rollup2
OF

01:52:53.367 --> 01:52:59.673 region:rollup2
ALL THE COMPLAINTS THAT HAD BEEN

01:52:54.868 --> 01:53:02.976 region:rollup2
FILED AND SO IT RAISE THE. A.

01:52:59.673 --> 01:53:04.945 region:rollup2
IT RAISES THE NOTORIETY OF IT.

01:53:02.976 --> 01:53:06.446 region:rollup2
WHICH.

01:53:04.945 --> 01:53:09.316 region:rollup2
I DO NOT THINK THAT AN

01:53:06.446 --> 01:53:11.418 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATIVE AGENCY.

01:53:09.316 --> 01:53:14.354 region:rollup2
SHOULD ENGAGE AND BE

01:53:11.418 --> 01:53:16.957 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATIVE AGENCY MUST ENSURE

01:53:14.354 --> 01:53:20.594 region:rollup2
THAT THE PROCESS IS FAIR TO THE

01:53:16.957 --> 01:53:23.930 region:rollup2
VICTIM. ALLEGED VICTIM TO THE.

01:53:20.594 --> 01:53:26.967 region:rollup2
ALLEGED PERPETRATOR. AND ONCE A

01:53:23.930 --> 01:53:30.303 region:rollup2
DETERMINATION IS MADE. THEN.

01:53:26.967 --> 01:53:32.606 region:rollup2
PUBLICITY IS FINE NOT A PROBLEM.

01:53:30.303 --> 01:53:34.207 region:rollup2
BUT PRIOR TO THAT TIME I I DO

01:53:32.606 --> 01:53:36.276 region:rollup2
NOT THINK THAT IT'S APPROPRIATE.

01:53:34.207 --> 01:53:39.546 region:rollup2
.

01:53:36.276 --> 01:53:41.982 region:rollup2
SO. I I ALSO THINK I MEAN.

01:53:39.546 --> 01:53:43.316 region:rollup2
I UNDERSTAND WHY ACCUSERS LIKE

01:53:41.982 --> 01:53:44.751 region:rollup2
THERE WAS A QUESTION ABOUT

01:53:43.316 --> 01:53:47.320 region:rollup2
ANONYMOUS ACCUSERS.

01:53:44.751 --> 01:53:50.657 region:rollup2
I UNDERSTAND WHY THERE WOULD BE

01:53:47.320 --> 01:53:52.659 region:rollup2
ANONYMITY. UP NO QUESTION AND BE

01:53:50.657 --> 01:53:56.830 region:rollup2
THERE HAS TO BE PROTECTION FOR

01:53:52.659 --> 01:53:59.032 region:rollup2
THE ACCUSERS AS WELL AND SO.

01:53:56.830 --> 01:54:01.034 region:rollup2
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THERE BE

01:53:59.032 --> 01:54:03.637 region:rollup2
SOME KIND OF A FLEXIBLE

01:54:01.034 --> 01:54:05.439 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATIVE PROCESS.

01:54:03.637 --> 01:54:06.540 region:rollup2
SO THAT THE ROOM RIGHTS IN THE

01:54:05.439 --> 01:54:08.041 region:rollup2
PRIVACY OF THE ACCUSERS.

01:54:06.540 --> 01:54:09.943 region:rollup2
ATTACKED.

01:54:08.041 --> 01:54:12.512 region:rollup2
BUT.

01:54:09.943 --> 01:54:15.182 region:rollup2
WITH COGNIZANT OF THEM

01:54:12.512 --> 01:54:17.818 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THE RIGHTS

01:54:15.182 --> 01:54:19.820 region:rollup2
AND PRIVACY NEEDS OF THE.

01:54:17.818 --> 01:54:21.488 region:rollup2
DEFENSE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE BEING

01:54:19.820 --> 01:54:22.923 region:rollup2
ACCUSED AS WELL.

01:54:21.488 --> 01:54:24.124 region:rollup2
SO WITH THAT I DON'T WANT TO

01:54:22.923 --> 01:54:24.958 region:rollup2
TAKE TOO MUCH OF YOUR TIME BUT

01:54:24.124 --> 01:54:27.227 region:rollup2
I'M MORE THAN HAPPY TO ANSWER

01:54:24.958 --> 01:54:30.163 region:rollup2
SINCE.

01:54:27.227 --> 01:54:31.732 region:rollup2
I'M THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.

ARE STARTING TO IS GOOD THE

01:54:32.733 --> 01:54:36.903 region:rollup2
PANEL IS MOVE IS STARTING TO

01:54:34.301 --> 01:54:38.638 region:rollup2
MOVE FROM IDENTIFYING PROBLEM.

01:54:36.903 --> 01:54:40.073 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT ISSUES AND ALSO INTO

01:54:38.638 --> 01:54:41.808 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS

01:54:40.073 --> 01:54:43.543 region:rollup2
SO ARMED THIS IS A YOU KNOW A

01:54:41.808 --> 01:54:45.178 region:rollup2
VERY INTERESTING AREA AND

01:54:43.543 --> 01:54:47.981 region:rollup2
THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF SUGGESTION

01:54:45.178 --> 01:54:50.183 region:rollup2
AND A LOT OF FOUGHT AMONGST US.

01:54:47.981 --> 01:54:52.052 region:rollup2
ABOUT BREEN OUTSIDE ENTITY OF

01:54:50.183 --> 01:54:54.521 region:rollup2
SOME SORT IN OR CREATING ONE AND

01:54:52.052 --> 01:54:56.690 region:rollup2
HOUSE AND HOW YOU BALANCE.

01:54:54.521 --> 01:54:58.325 region:rollup2
THE GOVERNANCE OF THIS BODY

01:54:56.690 --> 01:55:00.093 region:rollup2
HAVING BEEN FROM WITHIN. THE

01:54:58.325 --> 01:55:01.795 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE.

01:55:00.093 --> 01:55:03.930 region:rollup2
TO LOOKING AT THESE OUTSIDE NOT

01:55:01.795 --> 01:55:06.433 region:rollup2
JUST INVESTIGATORS OR ADVISORS

01:55:03.930 --> 01:55:08.802 region:rollup2
BUT THE F. PPC ACTION IS ALSO AN

01:55:06.433 --> 01:55:11.037 region:rollup2
ENFORCER. AND WHEN IT COMES TO

01:55:08.802 --> 01:55:12.038 region:rollup2
CAMPAIGN FINANCE AND IT COMES TO

01:55:11.037 --> 01:55:13.407 region:rollup2
CERTAIN TYPES OF ETHICS

01:55:12.038 --> 01:55:15.575 region:rollup2
VIOLATIONS.

01:55:13.407 --> 01:55:16.910 region:rollup2
WE DON'T POLICE OURSELVES WE

01:55:15.575 --> 01:55:18.645 region:rollup2
SEEM TO HAVE AN OUTSIDE BODY

01:55:16.910 --> 01:55:21.014 region:rollup2
THAT DOES THAT WHICH HAS SOME

01:55:18.645 --> 01:55:23.150 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES BUT ALSO.

01:55:21.014 --> 01:55:25.752 region:rollup2
A IS THEM OUT IN MY MIND A MUCH

01:55:23.150 --> 01:55:27.187 region:rollup2
FAIRER. WAY FOR EVERYBODY OF

01:55:25.752 --> 01:55:28.588 region:rollup2
HAVING THAT DONE.

01:55:27.187 --> 01:55:29.890 region:rollup2
BECAUSE.

01:55:28.588 --> 01:55:31.258 region:rollup2
PEOPLE HAVE SAID WELL THE LATEST

01:55:29.890 --> 01:55:32.759 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE'S INCAPABLE OF

01:55:31.258 --> 01:55:33.193 region:rollup2
POLICING ITSELF BUT I WOULD ALSO

01:55:32.759 --> 01:55:35.262 region:rollup2
SUBMIT THAT IT'S ON

01:55:33.193 --> 01:55:36.930 region:rollup2
FAIR.

01:55:35.262 --> 01:55:37.964 region:rollup2
TO EXPECT COLLEAGUES TO POLICE

01:55:36.930 --> 01:55:38.965 region:rollup2
OTHER COLLEAGUES AND I DON'T

01:55:37.964 --> 01:55:40.500 region:rollup2
BELIEVE THAT IN THE PRIVATE

01:55:38.965 --> 01:55:42.936 region:rollup2
SECTOR WE ASK.

01:55:40.500 --> 01:55:44.171 region:rollup2
PEOPLE TO BRING THEIR EVILS EN

01:55:42.936 --> 01:55:45.772 region:rollup2
IT THERE'S BEEN A WORKPLACE

01:55:44.171 --> 01:55:47.808 region:rollup2
ISSUE AND THEN VOTE ON WHAT

01:55:45.772 --> 01:55:48.408 region:rollup2
HAPPENS TO THEM YOU KNOW THE LOG

01:55:47.808 --> 01:55:50.644 region:rollup2
GUIDES US IN GUIDELINES GUIDE

01:55:48.408 --> 01:55:52.779 region:rollup2
US.

01:55:50.644 --> 01:55:54.080 region:rollup2
BUT I WILL ALSO SAY THAT WE'RE

01:55:52.779 --> 01:55:56.316 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT ISSUES THAT ARE

01:55:54.080 --> 01:55:57.617 region:rollup2
VERY MUCH WORKPLACE ISSUES ABOUT

01:55:56.316 --> 01:55:58.985 region:rollup2
HOW PEOPLE WORK WITH EACH OTHER

01:55:57.617 --> 01:56:00.821 region:rollup2
WHICH IS DIFFERENT.

01:55:58.985 --> 01:56:02.155 region:rollup2
CAMPAIGN ISSUE OR ANOTHER TYPE

01:56:00.821 --> 01:56:03.757 region:rollup2
OF ETHNICAL ISSUE SO HOW WOULD

01:56:02.155 --> 01:56:05.525 region:rollup2
YOU.

01:56:03.757 --> 01:56:06.927 region:rollup2
JUDGE THAT WOULD YOU ANTICIPATE

01:56:05.525 --> 01:56:09.396 region:rollup2
CHO CLEARLY YOU THOUGHT ABOUT

01:56:06.927 --> 01:56:10.630 region:rollup2
THIS. A PROCESS WHERE.

01:56:09.396 --> 01:56:12.365 region:rollup2
YOU RULES AND HUMAN RESOURCES

01:56:10.630 --> 01:56:13.500 region:rollup2
DEALS WITH ISSUES THAT THEY CAN

01:56:12.365 --> 01:56:15.268 region:rollup2
DEAL WITH BUT WHEN THINGS SORT

01:56:13.500 --> 01:56:16.837 region:rollup2
OF HIT CERTAIN THRESHOLD THAT WE

01:56:15.268 --> 01:56:19.039 region:rollup2
ALL UNDERSTAND.

01:56:16.837 --> 01:56:20.540 region:rollup2
OF CROSSING AN ETHICAL LINE THAT

01:56:19.039 --> 01:56:23.043 region:rollup2
THEY WITH THEM BRING THE F. PPC

01:56:20.540 --> 01:56:25.345 region:rollup2
CN OR WOULD EMPLOYEES GO

01:56:23.043 --> 01:56:27.481 region:rollup2
DIRECTLY TO THE F. PPC WANTED AN

01:56:25.345 --> 01:56:28.882 region:rollup2
ALLEGATION INVOLVES A MEMBER.

01:56:27.481 --> 01:56:29.583 region:rollup2
HAVE YOU GIVEN THAT ANY THOUGHT

01:56:28.882 --> 01:56:31.718 region:rollup2
DO YOU THINK THAT THAT'S ALL

01:56:29.583 --> 01:56:35.021 region:rollup2
KIND OF TO BE DETERMINED WELL I

01:56:31.718 --> 01:56:37.791 region:rollup2
THINK IT IT. COULD BE DETERMINED

01:56:35.021 --> 01:56:39.759 region:rollup2
ALBUM BASED ON WHAT THE

01:56:37.791 --> 01:56:41.661 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE OBVIOUSLY FEELS IS

01:56:39.759 --> 01:56:44.164 region:rollup2
THE MOST COMFORTABLE I DON'T

01:56:41.661 --> 01:56:46.566 region:rollup2
THINK IT'S A QUESTION OF.

01:56:44.164 --> 01:56:49.269 region:rollup2
WHAT'S THE BEST OR WHAT VOTE.

01:56:46.566 --> 01:56:52.038 region:rollup2
EITHER WAY WOULD WORK ALTHOUGH.

01:56:49.269 --> 01:56:54.474 region:rollup2
AND CERTAINLY A DOZEN AGENCIES

01:56:52.038 --> 01:56:56.109 region:rollup2
SUCH AS A FPP SEE.

01:56:54.474 --> 01:56:58.044 region:rollup2
WOULD BE SUITED TO DO THAT

01:56:56.109 --> 01:57:00.614 region:rollup2
BECAUSE SOME OF THOSE ISSUES AS

01:56:58.044 --> 01:57:03.650 region:rollup2
YOU AS YOU MENTIONED.

01:57:00.614 --> 01:57:06.386 region:rollup2
ETHICS ISSUES SOME OF THEM CAN

01:57:03.650 --> 01:57:10.023 region:rollup2
RELATE TO WORKPLACE.

01:57:06.386 --> 01:57:10.991 region:rollup2
ISSUES TO AND SO. FPP SEE

01:57:10.023 --> 01:57:12.692 region:rollup2
ALREADY HAS.

01:57:10.991 --> 01:57:14.794 region:rollup2
.

01:57:12.692 --> 01:57:17.697 region:rollup2
GROUP THAT IS SET UP TO

01:57:14.794 --> 01:57:22.102 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATE CASES AND OF

01:57:17.697 --> 01:57:25.272 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY THESE DO HAVE.

01:57:22.102 --> 01:57:27.107 region:rollup2
A LITTLE MORE. I'M.

01:57:25.272 --> 01:57:29.910 region:rollup2
SENSITIVITY AND NAY PROBABLY

01:57:27.107 --> 01:57:32.245 region:rollup2
WOULD REQUIRE MORE WITNESSES

01:57:29.910 --> 01:57:33.914 region:rollup2
THEN WHAT NORMALLY IS DONE

01:57:32.245 --> 01:57:36.082 region:rollup2
THROUGH FTP SI INVESTIGATIONS

01:57:33.914 --> 01:57:38.051 region:rollup2
BUT.

01:57:36.082 --> 01:57:40.620 region:rollup2
AN OUTSIDE AGENCY COULD DO ALL

01:57:38.051 --> 01:57:42.389 region:rollup2
OF THE ABOVE AND MAKE IT I'M A

01:57:40.620 --> 01:57:44.090 region:rollup2
LOT MORE.

01:57:42.389 --> 01:57:47.160 region:rollup2
MAY BE A LOT MORE INDEPENDENT

01:57:44.090 --> 01:57:48.628 region:rollup2
JUST IN GENERAL.

01:57:47.160 --> 01:57:49.896 region:rollup2
SO YOU WOULD ANTICIPATE OR WHAT

01:57:48.628 --> 01:57:51.231 region:rollup2
YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE THINKING IS

01:57:49.896 --> 01:57:53.600 region:rollup2
IN THE SAME WAY THAT WHEN THERE

01:57:51.231 --> 01:57:55.802 region:rollup2
ARE SEXUAL HARASSMENT CLAIMS.

01:57:53.600 --> 01:57:57.504 region:rollup2
AGAINST MEMBERS THE LEGISLATURE

01:57:55.802 --> 01:57:59.673 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY HIRES OUTSIDE

01:57:57.504 --> 01:58:00.640 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATORS YOU WOULD. YOU SAY

01:57:59.673 --> 01:58:01.942 region:rollup2
THAT THE SAME THING WOULD HAPPEN

01:58:00.640 --> 01:58:03.443 region:rollup2
IT SHOWS THAT THE RESPONSIBILITY

01:58:01.942 --> 01:58:03.777 region:rollup2
OF THAT OVERSIGHT WHICH SHIFT TO

01:58:03.443 --> 01:58:05.045 region:rollup2
THE F. PEOPLE

01:58:03.777 --> 01:58:06.780 region:rollup2
SEED.

01:58:05.045 --> 01:58:08.949 region:rollup2
TO BASICALLY HIGHER SORT OF THE

01:58:06.780 --> 01:58:10.116 region:rollup2
SAME FROM THE SAME BUT I WOULD

01:58:08.949 --> 01:58:11.685 region:rollup2
THINK LIMITED GROUP OF

01:58:10.116 --> 01:58:13.086 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATORS THAT ARE THERE.

01:58:11.685 --> 01:58:16.423 region:rollup2
AND THEN THE DECISION THAT WILL

01:58:13.086 --> 01:58:17.090 region:rollup2
BE MADE AS TO WHT THE WHERE I'M

01:58:16.423 --> 01:58:19.960 region:rollup2
AT AND WHETHER OR NOT.

01:58:17.090 --> 01:58:21.695 region:rollup2
AFTER ALLEGATIONS SUSTAIN AND

01:58:19.960 --> 01:58:22.963 region:rollup2
THE PENALTIES WOULD BE.

01:58:21.695 --> 01:58:24.831 region:rollup2
EITHER SUGGESTED BY THE HAPPY

01:58:22.963 --> 01:58:26.499 region:rollup2
PEACE HERE ACTUALLY ENFORCED AND

01:58:24.831 --> 01:58:29.002 region:rollup2
SORT OF HANDED DOWN BY THE F.

01:58:26.499 --> 01:58:31.404 region:rollup2
PPC. RIGHT WEALTHY WHAT THE F.

01:58:29.002 --> 01:58:33.206 region:rollup2
PPC DOES AS THE COMMISSION IS

01:58:31.404 --> 01:58:35.575 region:rollup2
THERE ARE TIMES THAT THEY WOULD

01:58:33.206 --> 01:58:36.109 region:rollup2
LOOK AT A RECOMMENDATION FROM

01:58:35.575 --> 01:58:39.913 region:rollup2
THE INVESTIGATOR. AND I'M

01:58:36.109 --> 01:58:43.817 region:rollup2
SAYING.

01:58:39.913 --> 01:58:46.653 region:rollup2
EITHER WE THINK THAT THERE IS.

01:58:43.817 --> 01:58:49.456 region:rollup2
AN ERROR IN THE JUDGMENT.

01:58:46.653 --> 01:58:51.891 region:rollup2
AND THAT THIS IS NOT A MATTER

01:58:49.456 --> 01:58:54.027 region:rollup2
THAT IS ACTUALLY SEXUAL

01:58:51.891 --> 01:58:57.364 region:rollup2
HARASSMENT OR THE REVERSE.

01:58:54.027 --> 01:58:59.966 region:rollup2
I SO THE AT THE COMMISSION WOULD

01:58:57.364 --> 01:59:01.234 region:rollup2
EXERCISE INDEPENDENT JUDGMENT IN

01:58:59.966 --> 01:59:02.969 region:rollup2
THAT RESPECT WITH REGARD. IT'S

01:59:01.234 --> 01:59:06.373 region:rollup2
NOT.

01:59:02.969 --> 01:59:08.641 region:rollup2
COMMON BUT IT HAPPENS IT DOES

01:59:06.373 --> 01:59:11.244 region:rollup2
HAPPEN. OF THAT. NOT ONLY DO YOU

01:59:08.641 --> 01:59:14.781 region:rollup2
OF MAKE THE DECISION AT THE. AT

01:59:11.244 --> 01:59:17.017 region:rollup2
THE COMMISSION LEVEL AS TO WHAT

01:59:14.781 --> 01:59:19.886 region:rollup2
THE PENALTY SHOULD BE. BUT

01:59:17.017 --> 01:59:21.421 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES YOU DON'T AGREE WITH

01:59:19.886 --> 01:59:23.790 region:rollup2
THE INVESTIGATORS.

01:59:21.421 --> 01:59:24.724 region:rollup2
ASSESSMENT OF A PARTICULAR CASE

01:59:23.790 --> 01:59:27.827 region:rollup2
THE OTHER.

01:59:24.724 --> 01:59:30.397 region:rollup2
ASPECT OF IT IS THAT THE F. PPC

01:59:27.827 --> 01:59:32.565 region:rollup2
CAN DO WELL THERE.

01:59:30.397 --> 01:59:34.434 region:rollup2
OVERSEEING THE INVESTIGATORS IS

01:59:32.565 --> 01:59:38.338 region:rollup2
TO DETERMINE WHICH IS SOMETHING

01:59:34.434 --> 01:59:40.673 region:rollup2
THAT THAT WAS ALWAYS ON MY MIND.

01:59:38.338 --> 01:59:42.909 region:rollup2
WHEN DEALING WITH THE OTHER

01:59:40.673 --> 01:59:45.912 region:rollup2
ENFORCEMENT DIVISION AT THE F.

01:59:42.909 --> 01:59:47.347 region:rollup2
PPC. IS WHETHER EITHER THEY ARE

01:59:45.912 --> 01:59:50.450 region:rollup2
BEING.

TO BLACKS OR BEING TOO ONEROUS

01:59:50.450 --> 01:59:54.854 region:rollup2
AND SO YOU YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT

01:59:53.053 --> 01:59:57.223 region:rollup2
PATTERNS.

01:59:54.854 --> 02:00:00.593 region:rollup2
OF THE INVESTIGATORS TO BE ABLE

01:59:57.223 --> 02:00:03.229 region:rollup2

UNBIASED

02:00:04.230 --> 02:00:08.301 region:rollup2
AS WELL.

02:00:06.933 --> 02:00:09.803 region:rollup2
SO YOU WOULD COME BACK THEN THE

02:00:08.301 --> 02:00:11.905 region:rollup2
UP PPC WOULD COME BACK WITH THE

02:00:09.803 --> 02:00:13.473 region:rollup2
FINDING. BASIN INVESTIGATION

02:00:11.905 --> 02:00:14.574 region:rollup2
THAT THEY OVERSAW BUT THEN WHAT

02:00:13.473 --> 02:00:15.542 region:rollup2
WHAT THE PENALTIES BICU

02:00:14.574 --> 02:00:16.976 region:rollup2
BECAUSE TYPICALLY WITH THE

02:00:15.542 --> 02:00:18.111 region:rollup2
CAMPAIGN VIOLATION THERE WOULD

02:00:16.976 --> 02:00:19.546 region:rollup2
BE A MONETARY PENALTIES

02:00:18.111 --> 02:00:20.780 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES THERE COULD BE A

02:00:19.546 --> 02:00:21.848 region:rollup2
CRIMINAL PENALTY.

02:00:20.780 --> 02:00:24.317 region:rollup2
BUT WHEN IT COMES TO SEXUAL

02:00:21.848 --> 02:00:26.686 region:rollup2
HARASSMENT AND YOUR THE

02:00:24.317 --> 02:00:29.055 region:rollup2
VIOLATION IS AGAINST AND

02:00:26.686 --> 02:00:31.558 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEES IN THE LEGISLATURE.

HOW WITH THE F. PPC THEN?

IN RESOLVE THAT. RIGHT WELL

02:00:34.861 --> 02:00:41.000 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD BE HAVE TO BE PART OF

02:00:37.597 --> 02:00:42.135 region:rollup2
WHATEVER LEGISLATION. IS A.

02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:44.337 region:rollup2
ULTIMATELY ENACTED BY THE

02:00:42.135 --> 02:00:46.139 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE AS TO WHAT THEY

02:00:44.337 --> 02:00:49.375 region:rollup2
THINK THAT THE RANGE.

02:00:46.139 --> 02:00:52.011 region:rollup2
OF WHAT WHAT THE RANGE OF AND.

02:00:49.375 --> 02:00:53.913 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL PENALTIES SHOULD BE AB

02:00:52.011 --> 02:00:56.483 region:rollup2
ACCORDING TO AS ONE OF THE

02:00:53.913 --> 02:00:58.451 region:rollup2
PREVIOUS A PANELISTS TALKED

02:00:56.483 --> 02:01:00.620 region:rollup2
ABOUT.

02:00:58.451 --> 02:01:02.355 region:rollup2
DEPENDENT ON WHAT THE A

02:01:00.620 --> 02:01:04.991 region:rollup2
HAPPENING.

02:01:02.355 --> 02:01:06.760 region:rollup2
WITH THE VIOLATION ALLEGEDLY WAS

02:01:04.991 --> 02:01:07.827 region:rollup2
AND WHAT IS FOUND.

02:01:06.760 --> 02:01:09.863 region:rollup2
TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S

02:01:07.827 --> 02:01:13.032 region:rollup2
COMMENSURATE WITH WHATEVER THAT

02:01:09.863 --> 02:01:15.769 region:rollup2
IS SO DEFINITELY THERE WOULD

02:01:13.032 --> 02:01:16.669 region:rollup2
HAVE TO BE NEW RULES NEW LAWS.

02:01:15.769 --> 02:01:17.570 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD.

02:01:16.669 --> 02:01:19.572 region:rollup2
GOVERNED.

02:01:17.570 --> 02:01:21.908 region:rollup2
SUCH.

02:01:19.572 --> 02:01:24.043 region:rollup2
OF A RULE FOR THE F. PPC IF

02:01:21.908 --> 02:01:25.578 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHO IT WAS THAT YOU CHOSE

02:01:24.043 --> 02:01:27.280 region:rollup2
AS OPPOSED TO STARTING UP

02:01:25.578 --> 02:01:28.948 region:rollup2
ENTIRELY NEW COMMITTEE.

02:01:27.280 --> 02:01:31.151 region:rollup2
AND WE'VE TALKED HERE ABOUT

02:01:28.948 --> 02:01:32.852 region:rollup2
HAVING A MORE OBJECTIVE CRITERIA

02:01:31.151 --> 02:01:34.487 region:rollup2

02:01:32.852 --> 02:01:36.356 region:rollup2
FOR LEGISLATORS.

02:01:34.487 --> 02:01:37.490 region:rollup2
AND JUST TO CLARIFY WHEN YOU

02:01:36.356 --> 02:01:39.893 region:rollup2
MENTION THE COMMISSION ARE YOU

02:01:37.490 --> 02:01:41.628 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT THE F. PPC ITSELF

02:01:39.893 --> 02:01:43.163 region:rollup2
FOR A NEW COMMISSION MUCH JUST

02:01:41.628 --> 02:01:45.465 region:rollup2
FOR SEXUAL HARASSMENT. THAT IT

02:01:43.163 --> 02:01:47.467 region:rollup2
COULD BE EITHER.

02:01:45.465 --> 02:01:49.169 region:rollup2
IT COULD BE EITHER MEAN IT IT.

02:01:47.467 --> 02:01:51.304 region:rollup2
PROBABLY CONVENIENT THAT IT

02:01:49.169 --> 02:01:54.974 region:rollup2
ALREADY HAS. A COMMISSION

02:01:51.304 --> 02:01:57.310 region:rollup2

02:01:54.974 --> 02:01:59.546 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY I I WOULD GUESS

02:01:57.310 --> 02:02:01.281 region:rollup2
THAT MOST OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE

02:01:59.546 --> 02:02:04.617 region:rollup2

02:02:15.161 --> 02:02:20.166 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT GROUP OF COMMISSIONERS

02:02:17.030 --> 02:02:22.202 region:rollup2
THAT MIGHT. BE BETTER SUITED TO

02:02:20.166 --> 02:02:23.736 region:rollup2
HANDLE CASES SUCH AS THIS BUT

I WILL SAY THAT IN MY OWN CASE

02:06:41.127 --> 02:06:45.898 region:rollup2
MANY YEARS AGO THE TIMELINESS OF

02:06:43.896 --> 02:06:48.134 region:rollup2
IT FAILED AND I WAS REALLY.

02:06:45.898 --> 02:06:50.203 region:rollup2
AFFECTED JOB FOR A NUMBER OF

02:06:48.134 --> 02:06:52.839 region:rollup2
YEARS BY A JUDGMENT THAT WAS

02:06:50.203 --> 02:06:53.406 region:rollup2
FINALLY RULED AROUND THE HOUSE

02:06:52.839 --> 02:06:53.840 region:rollup2
BUT IT TOOK THREE AND A HALF

02:06:53.406 --> 02:06:55.308 region:rollup2
YEARS.

02:06:53.840 --> 02:06:56.209 region:rollup2
IN AFFECTED CERTAINLY ON MY MY

02:06:55.308 --> 02:06:57.043 region:rollup2
MY BUSINESS AT THAT TIME. BUT

02:06:56.209 --> 02:06:58.244 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW PEOPLE IN

02:06:57.043 --> 02:06:59.645 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABILITY AND MISTAKES

02:06:58.244 --> 02:07:01.447 region:rollup2
HAPPEN IN MINUS CORRECTED BUT I

02:06:59.645 --> 02:07:03.716 region:rollup2
THINK IN THIS INSTANCE SOMETHING

02:07:01.447 --> 02:07:06.319 region:rollup2
THAT TOOK THAT LONG OUGHT TO.

02:07:03.716 --> 02:07:08.120 region:rollup2
ADJUDICATE AND THEN FIND SOMEONE

02:07:06.319 --> 02:07:09.856 region:rollup2
INNOCENT WHEN THEY WERE A

02:07:08.120 --> 02:07:12.091 region:rollup2
PERCEIVED AS GUILTY FOR THAT

02:07:09.856 --> 02:07:13.426 region:rollup2
AMOUNT OF TIME IS HORRIFIC IT'S

02:07:12.091 --> 02:07:15.228 region:rollup2
HORRIFIC TO THEIR CAREER PATH AS

02:07:13.426 --> 02:07:16.329 region:rollup2
YOUNG PEOPLE. IT'S HORRIFIC TO

02:07:15.228 --> 02:07:17.930 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WHO ARE IN THIS FOR A

02:07:16.329 --> 02:07:19.632 region:rollup2
SHORT PERIOD OF TIME BECAUSE OF

02:07:17.930 --> 02:07:22.268 region:rollup2
TERM LIMITS MUST RETURN. OUGHT

02:07:19.632 --> 02:07:24.537 region:rollup2
TO THEIR FORMER ALL CAREER ALSO

02:07:22.268 --> 02:07:26.005 region:rollup2
WE HAVE TO BE EXTREMELY MINDFUL

02:07:24.537 --> 02:07:28.908 region:rollup2
OF THAT AS WE GO FORWARD AND WE

02:07:26.005 --> 02:07:30.576 region:rollup2
COME UP WITHOUT A LEVEL IN LIST.

02:07:28.908 --> 02:07:33.880 region:rollup2
OF CONSEQUENCES AND HOW THAT

02:07:30.576 --> 02:07:36.082 region:rollup2
WILL BE HANDLED IN I DO I VOTE I

02:07:33.880 --> 02:07:37.817 region:rollup2
DON'T MAKE IT VERY PUBLIC I

02:07:36.082 --> 02:07:39.886 region:rollup2
BUILT FOR TOTAL. OUR

02:07:37.817 --> 02:07:41.521 region:rollup2
CONFIDENTIALITY UNTIL THERE'S A

02:07:39.886 --> 02:07:43.422 region:rollup2
RULING THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE IN

02:07:41.521 --> 02:07:45.324 region:rollup2
THE COURTS AND THAT CLEARLY IS

02:07:43.422 --> 02:07:47.360 region:rollup2
WHAT SHOULD BE SOMETHING THAT WE

02:07:45.324 --> 02:07:49.795 region:rollup2
ALL EMBRACE HERE. SO THANK YOU

02:07:47.360 --> 02:07:51.864 region:rollup2
FOR BRINGING THAT PERSPECTIVE

02:07:49.795 --> 02:07:54.467 region:rollup2
FORWARD I THINK I THINK LONG

02:07:51.864 --> 02:07:57.136 region:rollup2
LONG OVERDUE THANK YOU BUT I

02:07:54.467 --> 02:08:00.506 region:rollup2
AGREE WITH YOU I CAN'T EMPHASIZE

02:07:57.136 --> 02:08:03.109 region:rollup2
ENOUGH HELLO TIMELINESS IS

02:08:00.506 --> 02:08:04.343 region:rollup2
SOOOOOO CRUCIAL IN THESE.

02:08:03.109 --> 02:08:05.344 region:rollup2
ADMITTEDLY THE.

02:08:04.343 --> 02:08:05.912 region:rollup2
SEE HAS NOT ALWAYS HAD A GOOD

02:08:05.344 --> 02:08:07.413 region:rollup2
RECORD UN IN THAT RESPECT UP

02:08:05.912 --> 02:08:08.047 region:rollup2
BUT.

02:08:07.413 --> 02:08:08.681 region:rollup2
IT'S CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT I

02:08:08.047 --> 02:08:10.016 region:rollup2
THINK IS IMPORTANT AND THAT'S

02:08:08.681 --> 02:08:12.585 region:rollup2
WHY.

02:08:10.016 --> 02:08:14.153 region:rollup2
ANY ANY LEGISLATION IF THAT'S

02:08:12.585 --> 02:08:16.556 region:rollup2
WHAT YOU DETERMINE THAT YOU'RE

02:08:14.153 --> 02:08:19.225 region:rollup2
GOING TO DO SHOULD INCLUDE

02:08:16.556 --> 02:08:21.594 region:rollup2
TARGETS FOR TIMELINESS.

02:08:19.225 --> 02:08:22.962 region:rollup2
AND MY ISSUE IS A CONFLICT OF

02:08:21.594 --> 02:08:24.864 region:rollup2
INTEREST AS A MAYOR OF A CITY

02:08:22.962 --> 02:08:25.831 region:rollup2
MAHOOD AND WHETHER I DID OR

02:08:24.864 --> 02:08:27.233 region:rollup2
DIDN'T HAVE ONE AND IT WAS ALL

02:08:25.831 --> 02:08:28.768 region:rollup2
VERY SPECULATIVE AND A LOT OF

02:08:27.233 --> 02:08:30.469 region:rollup2
PEOPLE BECAUSE OF OTHER ISSUES

02:08:28.768 --> 02:08:32.138 region:rollup2
GOING ON. WE'RE ATTACKING THE

02:08:30.469 --> 02:08:34.674 region:rollup2
WHOLE COUNCIL AT THAT TIME BUT

02:08:32.138 --> 02:08:36.709 region:rollup2
IT TOOK THAT LONG. AND THOSE ARE

02:08:34.674 --> 02:08:37.109 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT WE HAVE TO BE VERY

02:08:36.709 --> 02:08:42.415 region:rollup2
MINDFUL OF HERE.

02:08:37.109 --> 02:08:46.052 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

02:08:42.415 --> 02:08:46.986 region:rollup2

APPRECIATE IT. SO I WOULD ASK MY

02:08:52.258 --> 02:08:54.560 region:rollup2
COLLEAGUES IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS

02:08:53.326 --> 02:08:58.264 region:rollup2
FOR THE PREVIOUS PANEL THERE

02:08:54.560 --> 02:08:59.632 region:rollup2
WAITING PATIENTLY SHOULD I BRING

02:08:58.264 --> 02:09:00.399 region:rollup2
THEM BACK UP. OKAY.

02:08:59.632 --> 02:09:01.934 region:rollup2
RIGHT AND WE DO HAVE ONE MORE OF

02:09:00.399 --> 02:09:03.069 region:rollup2
SPEAKER BUT WHY DON'T WE.

02:09:01.934 --> 02:09:04.604 region:rollup2
FINISH WITH THE QUESTIONS WITH

02:09:03.069 --> 02:09:05.104 region:rollup2
THE WHAT THE PREVIOUS PANEL ON

02:09:04.604 --> 02:09:06.906 region:rollup2
THEM WILL BRING OUR LAST

02:09:05.104 --> 02:09:08.908 region:rollup2
PANELIST UP.

02:09:06.906 --> 02:09:10.743 region:rollup2
THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR.

02:09:08.908 --> 02:09:13.179 region:rollup2
I WANTED TO COMMENT.

02:09:10.743 --> 02:09:15.615 region:rollup2
ON.

02:09:13.179 --> 02:09:19.785 region:rollup2
BUT.

02:09:15.615 --> 02:09:21.287 region:rollup2
OKAY.

02:09:19.785 --> 02:09:22.955 region:rollup2
THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I'M I WANT

02:09:21.287 --> 02:09:24.357 region:rollup2
TO COMMENT ON WHAT ONE OF OUR

02:09:22.955 --> 02:09:25.925 region:rollup2
COLLEAGUES SAID.

02:09:24.357 --> 02:09:28.094 region:rollup2
ASSEMBLYMEMBER DOLLY ABOUT AT

02:09:25.925 --> 02:09:29.462 region:rollup2
WILL EMPLOYEES AND REALLY

02:09:28.094 --> 02:09:31.631 region:rollup2
THERE'S A WAY TO FIX THAT IF WE

02:09:29.462 --> 02:09:32.865 region:rollup2
WANT TO ORGANIZE THE WORKPLACE

02:09:31.631 --> 02:09:33.366 region:rollup2
AND WHEN MEMBERS ARE AND WHEN

02:09:32.865 --> 02:09:34.967 region:rollup2
WORKERS ARE UNDER UNION

02:09:33.366 --> 02:09:36.535 region:rollup2
CONTRACT.

02:09:34.967 --> 02:09:37.870 region:rollup2
IT FIXES A LOT OF WHAT AILS US

02:09:36.535 --> 02:09:39.305 region:rollup2
IN THE WORKPLACE BECAUSE THE

02:09:37.870 --> 02:09:40.339 region:rollup2
EMPLOYERS KNOW WHAT THEY CAN AND

02:09:39.305 --> 02:09:42.408 region:rollup2
CAN'T DO AND THE WORKERS KNOW

02:09:40.339 --> 02:09:44.410 region:rollup2
WHAT THEY CAN AND CAN'T DO. SO I

02:09:42.408 --> 02:09:45.511 region:rollup2
JUST THROW THAT OUT IS SOMETHING

02:09:44.410 --> 02:09:46.846 region:rollup2
THAT WE COULD LOOK AT.

02:09:45.511 --> 02:09:48.581 region:rollup2
I WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT

02:09:46.846 --> 02:09:50.549 region:rollup2
ABOUT RETALIATION BECAUSE I

02:09:48.581 --> 02:09:52.518 region:rollup2
THINK RETALIATION IS INCREDIBLY

02:09:50.549 --> 02:09:55.054 region:rollup2
REAL FOR EVERY SINGLE PERSON WHO

02:09:52.518 --> 02:09:57.623 region:rollup2
IS NOT ELECTED. THAT WORKS IN

02:09:55.054 --> 02:09:59.625 region:rollup2
THE BUILDING AND THIS IS WORKING

02:09:57.623 --> 02:10:01.527 region:rollup2
HERE IN THE CAPITAL IS NOT LIKE

02:09:59.625 --> 02:10:03.763 region:rollup2
WORKING IN ANY OTHER PROFESSION.

02:10:01.527 --> 02:10:05.364 region:rollup2
IF YOU ARE BLACK CALLED IF YOU

02:10:03.763 --> 02:10:07.333 region:rollup2
ARE RETALIATED AGAINST WHERE DO

02:10:05.364 --> 02:10:08.801 region:rollup2
YOU GO AND GET A JOB AND THIS

02:10:07.333 --> 02:10:10.069 region:rollup2
MIGHT BE YOUR JUST BECAUSE

02:10:08.801 --> 02:10:11.704 region:rollup2
YOU'RE NOT THE ELECTED. YOU'RE

02:10:10.069 --> 02:10:12.772 region:rollup2
PASSIONATE ABOUT PUBLIC POLICY

02:10:11.704 --> 02:10:13.939 region:rollup2
YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE THINGS

02:10:12.772 --> 02:10:15.441 region:rollup2
BETTER I KNOW I COULD DO MY JOB

02:10:13.939 --> 02:10:16.909 region:rollup2
WITHOUT MY STAFF.

02:10:15.441 --> 02:10:20.079 region:rollup2
SO THINK WE REALLY HAVE TO THINK

02:10:16.909 --> 02:10:22.181 region:rollup2
ABOUT RETALIATION AND HOW.

02:10:20.079 --> 02:10:23.582 region:rollup2
EVERYONE HERE WORRIES ABOUT THAT

02:10:22.181 --> 02:10:25.351 region:rollup2
AND THEY'RE FEARFUL OF THAT.

02:10:23.582 --> 02:10:26.619 region:rollup2
I INVESTIGATING GRIEVANCES FOR

02:10:25.351 --> 02:10:28.587 region:rollup2
TWENTY YEARS WHEN I WAS IN THE

02:10:26.619 --> 02:10:30.156 region:rollup2
LABOR MOVEMENT AND WE USE TO SAY

02:10:28.587 --> 02:10:31.590 region:rollup2
THAT THERE'S TWO SIDES TO EVERY

02:10:30.156 --> 02:10:33.125 region:rollup2
STORY AND THE TRUTH LIES

02:10:31.590 --> 02:10:34.360 region:rollup2
SOMEWHERE IN BETWEEN. AND IT'S

02:10:33.125 --> 02:10:36.295 region:rollup2
NOT EVER BECAUSE SOMEONE'S

02:10:34.360 --> 02:10:37.663 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY LYING IT'S USUALLY

02:10:36.295 --> 02:10:40.032 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES PEOPLE ARE LYING BUT

02:10:37.663 --> 02:10:41.434 region:rollup2
USUALLY IT'S BECAUSE PEOPLE JUST

02:10:40.032 --> 02:10:43.102 region:rollup2
REMEMBER THINGS DIFFERENTLY SO

02:10:41.434 --> 02:10:45.171 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES INVESTIGATIONS MIGHT

02:10:43.102 --> 02:10:46.272 region:rollup2
TAKE A LITTLE LONGER BECAUSE YOU

02:10:45.171 --> 02:10:48.307 region:rollup2
HAVE TO TALK TO BROADER. A

02:10:46.272 --> 02:10:49.508 region:rollup2
BROADER BASE OF PEOPLE AND I

02:10:48.307 --> 02:10:51.744 region:rollup2
THINK WE SHOULD ALWAYS DO THAT

02:10:49.508 --> 02:10:53.379 region:rollup2
PUMP ISS WEST I WANTED TO THANK

02:10:51.744 --> 02:10:55.514 region:rollup2
YOU. FOR BRINGING UP THAT WE

02:10:53.379 --> 02:10:57.450 region:rollup2
SHOULD NEVER PUT A TIME LIMIT ON

02:10:55.514 --> 02:10:59.452 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATING BECAUSE WHAT I'VE

02:10:57.450 --> 02:11:00.286 region:rollup2
HEARD. THROUGHOUT THE LAST

02:10:59.452 --> 02:11:01.921 region:rollup2
MONTHS.

02:11:00.286 --> 02:11:04.223 region:rollup2
SOME PEOPLE HAVE SAID OH WELL

02:11:01.921 --> 02:11:05.224 region:rollup2
WHY IS THIS COMING OUT IT

02:11:04.223 --> 02:11:06.892 region:rollup2
HAPPENED SO LONG AGO.

02:11:05.224 --> 02:11:08.728 region:rollup2
WELL IT'S BECAUSE AS PEOPLE COME

02:11:06.892 --> 02:11:10.396 region:rollup2
FORWARD AND AS VICIOUS SO MANY

02:11:08.728 --> 02:11:11.931 region:rollup2
WOMEN HAVE COME FORWARD IT MAKES

02:11:10.396 --> 02:11:13.666 region:rollup2
ANOTHER WOMAN FEEL CONFIDENT

02:11:11.931 --> 02:11:15.101 region:rollup2
ENOUGH TO COME FORWARD. SO WE

02:11:13.666 --> 02:11:16.535 region:rollup2
CAN'T EVER SAY BECAUSE IT

02:11:15.101 --> 02:11:19.038 region:rollup2
HAPPENED FIVE YEARS AGO TEN

02:11:16.535 --> 02:11:19.972 region:rollup2
YEARS AGO THAT IT'S NOT VALID I

02:11:19.038 --> 02:11:22.541 region:rollup2
THINK ABOUT THE.

02:11:19.972 --> 02:11:24.577 region:rollup2
STATUE OF LIMITATION ON RAPE

02:11:22.541 --> 02:11:26.178 region:rollup2
BILL THAT WE PASSED OUT OF.

02:11:24.577 --> 02:11:28.047 region:rollup2
THAT THE GOVERNOR SIGNED INTO

02:11:26.178 --> 02:11:29.915 region:rollup2
LAW A COUPLE YEARS AGO YOU CAN'T

02:11:28.047 --> 02:11:31.617 region:rollup2
PUT A TIME LIMIT ON JUSTICE AND

02:11:29.915 --> 02:11:33.152 region:rollup2
EVERYONE HERE SAW THAT THE

02:11:31.617 --> 02:11:34.820 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR SAW THAT AND I THINK WE

02:11:33.152 --> 02:11:36.355 region:rollup2
NEED TO MAKE SURE. THAT WE'RE

02:11:34.820 --> 02:11:38.157 region:rollup2
LOOKING OUT FOR STAFF THE WE'RE

02:11:36.355 --> 02:11:39.692 region:rollup2
TAKING CARE OF THEM THERE ARE

02:11:38.157 --> 02:11:41.026 region:rollup2
HUNDRED AND TWENTY OF US THAT

02:11:39.692 --> 02:11:42.428 region:rollup2
WORK HERE IN THIS BUILDING AND I

02:11:41.026 --> 02:11:44.096 region:rollup2

COME FROM DIFFERENT WALKS OF

02:11:48.067 --> 02:11:52.037 region:rollup2
LIFE. BUTWE HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT

02:11:50.369 --> 02:11:54.006 region:rollup2
THE STAFF WHO WORK HERE BECAUSE.

02:11:52.037 --> 02:11:54.673 region:rollup2
WHEN I'M TURNED OUT MANY OF MY

02:11:54.006 --> 02:11:56.575 region:rollup2
STAFF STILL HAVE A CAREER AHEAD

02:11:54.673 --> 02:11:58.210 region:rollup2
OF THEM AND THEY WILL WANT TO GO

02:11:56.575 --> 02:11:59.545 region:rollup2
WORK FOR SOMEONE ELSE SO I JUST

02:11:58.210 --> 02:12:01.480 region:rollup2
PUT THAT OUT THERE TO MAKE SURE

02:11:59.545 --> 02:12:02.681 region:rollup2

BUILDING THE ONES WHO CAN BE

02:12:04.083 --> 02:12:07.620 region:rollup2
MOST TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF SO WE

02:12:05.885 --> 02:12:09.488 region:rollup2
HAVE TO HAVE POLICIES IN PLACE

02:12:07.620 --> 02:12:11.357 region:rollup2
TO PROTECT THEM BECAUSE ALL OF

02:12:09.488 --> 02:12:11.957 region:rollup2
US ELECTIVES ARE DIFFERENT AND

02:12:11.357 --> 02:12:13.826 region:rollup2
WE ALL COME FROM A DIFFERENT

02:12:11.957 --> 02:12:15.594 region:rollup2
PLACE. AND IF YOU DO NOT HAVE A

02:12:13.826 --> 02:12:17.430 region:rollup2
STAFF BEFORE YOU WERE ELECTED

02:12:15.594 --> 02:12:19.532 region:rollup2
YOU MAY NOT KNOW WHAT IS OKAY

02:12:17.430 --> 02:12:20.1000 region:rollup2
AND WHAT IS NOT OKAY TO DO SO I

02:12:19.532 --> 02:12:23.803 region:rollup2
HOPE THAT WE WILL CONTINUE THIS

02:12:20.1000 --> 02:12:24.837 region:rollup2
AND WE WILL. WE'LL GET TO WHERE

02:12:23.803 --> 02:12:27.473 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO BE.

02:12:24.837 --> 02:12:28.841 region:rollup2
THANK YOU MAY I RESPOND MANAGER.

02:12:27.473 --> 02:12:30.443 region:rollup2
HOME I. STAND FIRM WITH MY

02:12:28.841 --> 02:12:31.710 region:rollup2
BELIEF THAT THE HUNT AT THAT THE

02:12:30.443 --> 02:12:33.445 region:rollup2
ONE YEAR TIME LIMIT IN THE

02:12:31.710 --> 02:12:35.414 region:rollup2
POLICY SHOULD SHOULD NOT BE

02:12:33.445 --> 02:12:36.215 region:rollup2
THERE THAT ALL CLAIMS. OF

02:12:35.414 --> 02:12:38.083 region:rollup2
HARASSMENT SHOULD BE

02:12:36.215 --> 02:12:38.818 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATED BUT I THINK THERE'S

02:12:38.083 --> 02:12:41.053 region:rollup2
A COUNTER.

02:12:38.818 --> 02:12:45.257 region:rollup2
ARGUMENT OR BALANCE TO THAT

02:12:41.053 --> 02:12:48.093 region:rollup2
AND ONE AND I THINK WE WANT.

02:12:45.257 --> 02:12:50.429 region:rollup2
VERY VERY STRONGLY TO ENCOURAGE

02:12:48.093 --> 02:12:52.298 region:rollup2
PEOPLE TO REPORT.

02:12:50.429 --> 02:12:54.066 region:rollup2
RIGHT AWAY VERY QUICKLY OF FOR A

02:12:52.298 --> 02:12:55.434 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF REASONS ONE SO WE CAN

02:12:54.066 --> 02:12:57.970 region:rollup2
STOP THE CONDUCT STOP IT FROM

02:12:55.434 --> 02:12:59.972 region:rollup2
ESCALATING. ALSO BECAUSE AS YOU

02:12:57.970 --> 02:13:01.974 region:rollup2
JUST INDICATED ABOUT PERCEPTIONS

02:12:59.972 --> 02:13:04.577 region:rollup2
AND MEMORIES THE LONGER TIME

02:13:01.974 --> 02:13:07.913 region:rollup2
GOES BY MEMORIES FADE AS TO WHAT

02:13:04.577 --> 02:13:08.781 region:rollup2
DID OR DID NOT OCCUR. SO WELL I

02:13:07.913 --> 02:13:10.749 region:rollup2
DON'T THINK THEY SHOULD EVER BE

02:13:08.781 --> 02:13:12.151 region:rollup2
A TIME LIMIT ON INVESTIGATING A

02:13:10.749 --> 02:13:12.985 region:rollup2
REPORT OF MISCONDUCT IN THE

02:13:12.151 --> 02:13:14.286 region:rollup2
WORKPLACE AGAIN IF THEY BRING

02:13:12.985 --> 02:13:15.821 region:rollup2
SOME

02:13:14.286 --> 02:13:17.556 region:rollup2
FORWARD IT HAPPEN TO THEM YEARS

02:13:15.821 --> 02:13:19.825 region:rollup2
AGO. EITHER CONDUCT COULD BE

02:13:17.556 --> 02:13:21.827 region:rollup2
HAPPENING TO THEM AND OTHERS.

02:13:19.825 --> 02:13:24.396 region:rollup2
WITHIN THAT TIME PERIOD IS MY

02:13:21.827 --> 02:13:27.032 region:rollup2
PANEL MEMBER AND INDICATED BUT

02:13:24.396 --> 02:13:29.034 region:rollup2
ALSO. WE NEED TO ADDRESS THINGS

02:13:27.032 --> 02:13:31.270 region:rollup2
QUICKLY AND THE LONGER THE TIME

02:13:29.034 --> 02:13:34.106 region:rollup2
GOES BY THE HARDER IT IS TO

02:13:31.270 --> 02:13:34.607 region:rollup2
REALLY TRY TO. MAKE A REASONABLE

02:13:34.106 --> 02:13:36.242 region:rollup2
DETERMINATION AS TO WHAT

02:13:34.607 --> 02:13:38.344 region:rollup2
OCCURRED.

02:13:36.242 --> 02:13:39.478 region:rollup2
IF I ME. I COULD NOT AGREE MORE

02:13:38.344 --> 02:13:41.347 region:rollup2
WE WANT PEOPLE TO COME FORWARD

02:13:39.478 --> 02:13:43.582 region:rollup2
BUT THAT'S ON US THAT'S ON US

02:13:41.347 --> 02:13:45.017 region:rollup2
MAKING SURE THAT WE PUT IN PLACE

02:13:43.582 --> 02:13:46.452 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT MAKES PEOPLE THAT

02:13:45.017 --> 02:13:48.254 region:rollup2
THAT.

02:13:46.452 --> 02:13:49.989 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEES IN THIS BUILDING STAFF

02:13:48.254 --> 02:13:51.123 region:rollup2
IN THIS BUILDING FEEL SAFE AND

02:13:49.989 --> 02:13:52.791 region:rollup2
THEY FEEL LIKE THEY CAN COME

02:13:51.123 --> 02:13:54.293 region:rollup2
FORWARD BECAUSE I AGREE I DON'T

02:13:52.791 --> 02:13:55.728 region:rollup2
LIKE TO EE PEOPLE SIT ON THINGS

02:13:54.293 --> 02:13:57.396 region:rollup2
BUT I UNDERSTAND WHY IT HAPPENS.

02:13:55.728 --> 02:13:58.797 region:rollup2
SO IT'S ON US TO TRY AND FIND A

02:13:57.396 --> 02:14:00.299 region:rollup2
WAY THAT WE MAKE IT A SAFE

02:13:58.797 --> 02:14:01.700 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENT COME FORWARD AND AND

02:14:00.299 --> 02:14:02.301 region:rollup2
I THINK YOU'VE TAKEN THE RIGHT

02:14:01.700 --> 02:14:03.903 region:rollup2
STEP WITH THE RECENT

02:14:02.301 --> 02:14:05.604 region:rollup2
WHISTLEBLOWER A BILL THE CAT

02:14:03.903 --> 02:14:09.375 region:rollup2
SIGNED YES.

02:14:05.604 --> 02:14:10.776 region:rollup2
THANK YOU ISRAEL'S.

02:14:09.375 --> 02:14:13.045 region:rollup2
THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND THANK

02:14:10.776 --> 02:14:15.247 region:rollup2
YOU PANELISTS.

02:14:13.045 --> 02:14:16.882 region:rollup2
THE AREA THAT I I WOULD LIKE TO

02:14:15.247 --> 02:14:18.717 region:rollup2
SPEAK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT IS

02:14:16.882 --> 02:14:20.953 region:rollup2
CONFIDENTIALITY.

02:14:18.717 --> 02:14:22.621 region:rollup2
THE RESERVES STATEMENT MADE

02:14:20.953 --> 02:14:24.056 region:rollup2
THAT REPORTING IS THE VICTIMS

02:14:22.621 --> 02:14:26.058 region:rollup2
CHOICE.

02:14:24.056 --> 02:14:28.761 region:rollup2
I AGREE.

02:14:26.058 --> 02:14:30.496 region:rollup2
BUT IN THE END AFTER THE VICTIM

02:14:28.761 --> 02:14:33.899 region:rollup2
HOUSE.

02:14:30.496 --> 02:14:35.834 region:rollup2
CHOSEN TO TO REPORT AND IT IS

02:14:33.899 --> 02:14:38.537 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATED.

02:14:35.834 --> 02:14:40.472 region:rollup2
THE ISSUE OF A CONFIDENTIALITY

02:14:38.537 --> 02:14:42.107 region:rollup2
CLAUSE FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE

02:14:40.472 --> 02:14:44.643 region:rollup2
VICTIM.

02:14:42.107 --> 02:14:46.045 region:rollup2
IS THAT SOMETHING THAT BUT I

02:14:44.643 --> 02:14:48.714 region:rollup2
THINK I KNOW THAT IT YOU HAVE

02:14:46.045 --> 02:14:50.849 region:rollup2
STRONG OPINIONS REGARDING THIS.

02:14:48.714 --> 02:14:51.417 region:rollup2
IT'S BECAUSE THE END YOU'VE

02:14:50.849 --> 02:14:53.652 region:rollup2
MENTIONED THAT IT HAS TO DO

02:14:51.417 --> 02:14:55.087 region:rollup2
WITH.

02:14:53.652 --> 02:14:57.790 region:rollup2
A PUBLIC POLICY.

02:14:55.087 --> 02:15:00.225 region:rollup2
IT TRANSPARENCY AND I I

02:14:57.790 --> 02:15:02.962 region:rollup2
RECOGNIZE ALL OF THAT. IF THAT

02:15:00.225 --> 02:15:04.029 region:rollup2
IS SOMETHING THAT THE VICTIM IS

02:15:02.962 --> 02:15:07.032 region:rollup2
ASKING FOR UNDER WHAT

02:15:04.029 --> 02:15:07.533 region:rollup2
CIRCUMSTANCES IF ANY WOULD YOU

02:15:07.032 --> 02:15:09.034 region:rollup2
FEEL THAT THAT WOULD BE

02:15:07.533 --> 02:15:11.103 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE.

02:15:09.034 --> 02:15:12.738 region:rollup2
SO AYE I ALSO WANTED TO ADDRESS

02:15:11.103 --> 02:15:14.506 region:rollup2
THAT LABOR CODE TWO THREE TWO

02:15:12.738 --> 02:15:16.408 region:rollup2
POINT FIVE ALLOWS AND ACTUALLY

02:15:14.506 --> 02:15:18.978 region:rollup2
MANDATES.

02:15:16.408 --> 02:15:20.546 region:rollup2
THAT THERE CANNOT BE LIMITATIONS

02:15:18.978 --> 02:15:22.147 region:rollup2
ON DISCUSSIONS ABOUT TERMS AND

02:15:20.546 --> 02:15:23.949 region:rollup2
CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT.

02:15:22.147 --> 02:15:26.018 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S A LAW THAT ALREADY

02:15:23.949 --> 02:15:27.987 region:rollup2
APPLIES TO THIS BODY. AND IF

02:15:26.018 --> 02:15:30.456 region:rollup2
YOU'RE A AND SO I WANTED TO

02:15:27.987 --> 02:15:32.725 region:rollup2
RAISE THAT IT ALSO WITH THE NLRB

02:15:30.456 --> 02:15:35.127 region:rollup2
HEADED DECISION ABOUT CONCERTED

02:15:32.725 --> 02:15:37.963 region:rollup2
ACTIVITY. AND YOU SO IF YOU'RE

02:15:35.127 --> 02:15:39.932 region:rollup2
GOING TO GAG. INFORMATION FLOW

02:15:37.963 --> 02:15:41.567 region:rollup2
DURING AN INVESTIGATORY PROCESS

02:15:39.932 --> 02:15:42.835 region:rollup2
YOU REALLY HAVE TO QUESTION

02:15:41.567 --> 02:15:43.902 region:rollup2
WHETHER THAT'S.

02:15:42.835 --> 02:15:45.537 region:rollup2
AND IN KEEPING WITH CURRENT

02:15:43.902 --> 02:15:48.307 region:rollup2
LEGAL STANDARDS

02:15:45.537 --> 02:15:50.309 region:rollup2
SO I WANTED TO ADDRESS AT FIRST.

02:15:48.307 --> 02:15:52.011 region:rollup2
SECONDLY I THINK.

02:15:50.309 --> 02:15:52.911 region:rollup2
IT CONFIDENTIALITY CLAUSES ARE

02:15:52.011 --> 02:15:54.513 region:rollup2
GAGGING THE VICTIM THAT'S WHAT

02:15:52.911 --> 02:15:57.116 region:rollup2
THEY ARE.

02:15:54.513 --> 02:15:58.250 region:rollup2
I AM IN DO WE AS A BODY THINK

02:15:57.116 --> 02:15:59.518 region:rollup2
THAT AS A MATTER OF PUBLIC

02:15:58.250 --> 02:16:00.986 region:rollup2
POLICY WE OUGHT TO BE GAGGING

02:15:59.518 --> 02:16:02.855 region:rollup2
VICTIMS.

02:16:00.986 --> 02:16:04.590 region:rollup2
AND I WOULD SAY NO. THERE'S MANY

02:16:02.855 --> 02:16:07.259 region:rollup2
REASONS FOR THE US.

02:16:04.590 --> 02:16:09.261 region:rollup2
BOB ONE IS IT IT CONTINUES THE

02:16:07.259 --> 02:16:10.629 region:rollup2
CONDUCT THE UNLAWFUL CONDUCT IT

02:16:09.261 --> 02:16:13.399 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY DOESN'T BRING IT TO

02:16:10.629 --> 02:16:14.566 region:rollup2
LIFE IT CERTAINLY DOESN'T. A.

02:16:13.399 --> 02:16:15.334 region:rollup2
LEAD TO ANY ADEQUATE REMEDIAL

02:16:14.566 --> 02:16:17.136 region:rollup2
MEASURES

02:16:15.334 --> 02:16:18.303 region:rollup2
SO.

02:16:17.136 --> 02:16:20.205 region:rollup2
I THINK AS A MATTER OF PUBLIC

02:16:18.303 --> 02:16:22.174 region:rollup2
POLICY WE SHOULD HAVE

02:16:20.205 --> 02:16:24.777 region:rollup2
LIMITATIONS REGARDING SUCH

02:16:22.174 --> 02:16:26.378 region:rollup2
CAUSES WHICH ARE UBIQUITOUS.

02:16:24.777 --> 02:16:29.515 region:rollup2
A EMPLOYERS ASK FOR THESE AS A

02:16:26.378 --> 02:16:30.749 region:rollup2
MATTER. OF COURSE WHETHER IT

02:16:29.515 --> 02:16:32.084 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY BENEFITS THEM OR NOT

02:16:30.749 --> 02:16:33.652 region:rollup2
THEY MAY WISH TO HAVE THEIR

02:16:32.084 --> 02:16:35.154 region:rollup2
STORY COME OUT THEY MAY WISH TO

02:16:33.652 --> 02:16:37.423 region:rollup2
SAY YOU KNOW WHAT THAT'S NOT HOW

02:16:35.154 --> 02:16:38.590 region:rollup2
IT WENT DOWN. AND WE TOOK THIS

02:16:37.423 --> 02:16:40.025 region:rollup2
AS A BUSINESS DECISION ARM BUT

02:16:38.590 --> 02:16:42.127 region:rollup2
IF.

02:16:40.025 --> 02:16:43.729 region:rollup2
DATE UBIQUITOUS NATURE OF

02:16:42.127 --> 02:16:45.097 region:rollup2
CONFIDENTIALITY CLAUSES

02:16:43.729 --> 02:16:46.799 region:rollup2
PROHIBITS THAT SORT OF PUBLIC

02:16:45.097 --> 02:16:49.101 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION AND I THINK. WHAT

02:16:46.799 --> 02:16:50.803 region:rollup2
REALLY HAPPENS IS THE VICTIMS

02:16:49.101 --> 02:16:52.538 region:rollup2
ARE THE ONES THAT ARE GAGGED

02:16:50.803 --> 02:16:54.540 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT THE EMPLOYER?

02:16:52.538 --> 02:16:57.376 region:rollup2
SO IT IT THAT'S WHAT I FIND IN

02:16:54.540 --> 02:16:59.144 region:rollup2
MY PRACTICE IS THAT IF THERE'S A

02:16:57.376 --> 02:17:01.346 region:rollup2
CONFIDENTIALITY CLAUSE. IT'S

02:16:59.144 --> 02:17:03.048 region:rollup2
REALLY THE WOMAN WHO CAN'T TELL

02:17:01.346 --> 02:17:04.349 region:rollup2
HER DAUGHTER DON'T GO WORK FOR

02:17:03.048 --> 02:17:07.186 region:rollup2
THAT MEMBERS DON'T GO WORK FOR

02:17:04.349 --> 02:17:07.719 region:rollup2
THAT EMPLOYER. IT'S THE WOMAN

02:17:07.186 --> 02:17:09.688 region:rollup2
WHO CAN'T.

02:17:07.719 --> 02:17:10.823 region:rollup2
DISCUSS IT WITH HER THERAPIST

02:17:09.688 --> 02:17:12.558 region:rollup2
ENEMIES ARE AGAINST PUBLIC

02:17:10.823 --> 02:17:14.126 region:rollup2
POLICY AND I THINK THOSE THINGS

02:17:12.558 --> 02:17:16.829 region:rollup2
HAVE TO STOP.

02:17:14.126 --> 02:17:18.730 region:rollup2
NOT ONLY IN THE.

02:17:16.829 --> 02:17:20.566 region:rollup2
ONE ON ONE INTERACTION OF

02:17:18.730 --> 02:17:22.601 region:rollup2
GAGGING SOMEONE WHO'S BEEN THE

02:17:20.566 --> 02:17:24.269 region:rollup2
VICTIM OF A CRIME WE DON'T SAY

02:17:22.601 --> 02:17:25.804 region:rollup2
FOR HOMICIDE VICTIMS. IF TO BE

02:17:24.269 --> 02:17:27.673 region:rollup2
SILENT.

02:17:25.804 --> 02:17:29.007 region:rollup2
THE FAMILY MEMBERS OF THE

02:17:27.673 --> 02:17:30.976 region:rollup2
HOMICIDE VICTIM IT'S THE SAME

02:17:29.007 --> 02:17:32.377 region:rollup2
THING HERE THIS IS A CRIME.

02:17:30.976 --> 02:17:34.379 region:rollup2
AND WE CERTAINLY SHOULDN'T

02:17:32.377 --> 02:17:36.815 region:rollup2
ENABLE A CRIME BY KEEPING IT

02:17:34.379 --> 02:17:39.318 region:rollup2
ILENT I THINK THE SILENCE. IS

02:17:36.815 --> 02:17:39.952 region:rollup2
PART OF THE PROBLEM SO YES I DO

02:17:39.318 --> 02:17:40.119 region:rollup2
HAVE VERY STRONG FEELINGS ABOUT

02:17:39.952 --> 02:17:42.488 region:rollup2
IT.

02:17:40.119 --> 02:17:45.124 region:rollup2
.

02:17:42.488 --> 02:17:46.458 region:rollup2
THERE ARE SOME.

02:17:45.124 --> 02:17:48.660 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS WHO MAY CHOOSE

02:17:46.458 --> 02:17:51.263 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY ARE AFRAID OF

02:17:48.660 --> 02:17:54.199 region:rollup2
RETALIATION. I'M NOT TO COME

02:17:51.263 --> 02:17:56.668 region:rollup2
FORWARD I HAVE AGAIN CLIENTS WHO

02:17:54.199 --> 02:17:58.137 region:rollup2
REGULARLY RECIEVE PRESS CALLS

02:17:56.668 --> 02:17:59.671 region:rollup2
AND THEY DECLINED THEM.

02:17:58.137 --> 02:18:01.874 region:rollup2
AND THERE'S REASONS FOR THAT

02:17:59.671 --> 02:18:03.509 region:rollup2
AND I THINK. THAT'S SORT OF

02:18:01.874 --> 02:18:05.377 region:rollup2
CHOICE SHOULD LIE WITH THE

02:18:03.509 --> 02:18:07.513 region:rollup2
SURVIVOR.

02:18:05.377 --> 02:18:09.348 region:rollup2
BUT I DON'T THINK.

02:18:07.513 --> 02:18:10.883 region:rollup2
IT SHOULD BE AS A MATTER OF LA A

02:18:09.348 --> 02:18:12.851 region:rollup2
SURVIVOR OF HARASSMENT.

02:18:10.883 --> 02:18:13.986 region:rollup2
CAN KEEP THINGS CONFIDENTIAL BY

02:18:12.851 --> 02:18:15.721 region:rollup2
SIMPLY DOING NOT SPEAKING ABOUT

02:18:13.986 --> 02:18:17.656 region:rollup2
IT.

02:18:15.721 --> 02:18:19.591 region:rollup2
BUT NOT BEING MANDATED BY LAW

02:18:17.656 --> 02:18:21.960 region:rollup2
NOT TO SPEAK ABOUT.

02:18:19.591 --> 02:18:22.494 region:rollup2
SO. A VERY SIMPLE SOLUTION YOU

02:18:21.960 --> 02:18:24.296 region:rollup2
JUST DON'T TALK ABOUT IT.

02:18:22.494 --> 02:18:25.798 region:rollup2
.

02:18:24.296 --> 02:18:26.932 region:rollup2
BUT ALLOWING THOSE

02:18:25.798 --> 02:18:28.767 region:rollup2
CONFIDENTIALITY CLAUSES TO

02:18:26.932 --> 02:18:31.770 region:rollup2
PROCESS.

02:18:28.767 --> 02:18:32.404 region:rollup2
I THINK CREATES THOSE SYSTEMIC

02:18:31.770 --> 02:18:34.907 region:rollup2
PROBLEMS THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH

02:18:32.404 --> 02:18:36.575 region:rollup2
TODAY.

02:18:34.907 --> 02:18:37.776 region:rollup2
ALONG THOSE SAME LINES YOU.

02:18:36.575 --> 02:18:40.379 region:rollup2
MIGHT COME SORRY DON'T RECALL

02:18:37.776 --> 02:18:42.548 region:rollup2
WHO WAS THAT TALKED ABOUT IT.

02:18:40.379 --> 02:18:45.651 region:rollup2
THAT VICTIMS ABOUT THE VICTIMS

02:18:42.548 --> 02:18:47.886 region:rollup2
ABILITY TO GO STRAIGHT TO WEAVE.

02:18:45.651 --> 02:18:48.921 region:rollup2
AND TO HAVE THAT AS A PROTECTED

02:18:47.886 --> 02:18:49.121 region:rollup2
ACTIVITY BELIEVE IT WAS HERE.

02:18:48.921 --> 02:18:50.923 region:rollup2
WEST.

02:18:49.121 --> 02:18:51.790 region:rollup2
.

02:18:50.923 --> 02:18:53.425 region:rollup2
TELL US ABOUT WHY THAT IS SO

02:18:51.790 --> 02:18:55.060 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT

02:18:53.425 --> 02:18:57.529 region:rollup2
THAT THAT IT BE A PROTECTED

02:18:55.060 --> 02:18:58.130 region:rollup2
ACTIVITY. AND THEREFORE CANNOT

02:18:57.529 --> 02:19:00.165 region:rollup2
BE RETALIATED AGAINST

02:18:58.130 --> 02:19:02.367 region:rollup2
YES

02:19:00.165 --> 02:19:06.305 region:rollup2
SO WHILE I THINK IT'S A VERY

02:19:02.367 --> 02:19:07.439 region:rollup2
GOOD STEP TO ALLOW RESOURCES FOR

02:19:06.305 --> 02:19:08.941 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS WHO'VE BEEN

02:19:07.439 --> 02:19:10.776 region:rollup2
SUBJECTED TO HARASS.

02:19:08.941 --> 02:19:12.444 region:rollup2
TERMINATION RETALIATION

02:19:10.776 --> 02:19:14.546 region:rollup2
TO BE ABLE TO GO SOMEWHERE TO

02:19:12.444 --> 02:19:16.048 region:rollup2
OBTAIN THOSE SORT OF RESOURCES.

02:19:14.546 --> 02:19:17.549 region:rollup2
IN ORDER TO GET THINGS LIKE

02:19:16.048 --> 02:19:19.284 region:rollup2
THERAPY.

02:19:17.549 --> 02:19:22.221 region:rollup2
BUT IF AS A BODY YOU'RE SAYING

02:19:19.284 --> 02:19:23.355 region:rollup2
YOU CAN GO REPORT AGENCY AS A.

02:19:22.221 --> 02:19:25.224 region:rollup2
BUT WE DON'T CONSIDER THAT

02:19:23.355 --> 02:19:27.159 region:rollup2
REPORTER PROTECTED ACTIVITY WHAT

02:19:25.224 --> 02:19:29.061 region:rollup2
THE LEGAL RAMIFICATIONS OF THAT

02:19:27.159 --> 02:19:30.996 region:rollup2
IS IS IF THERE IS RETALIATION IN

02:19:29.061 --> 02:19:32.331 region:rollup2
THE WORKPLACE.

02:19:30.996 --> 02:19:34.466 region:rollup2
THAT IS NOT CONSIDER TO

02:19:32.331 --> 02:19:38.070 region:rollup2
PROTECTED ACTIVITIES SUCH THAT

02:19:34.466 --> 02:19:39.738 region:rollup2
DOT VICTIM THEN CAN HAVE LEGAL

02:19:38.070 --> 02:19:41.240 region:rollup2
REMEDIES SITS THEY ARE. A

02:19:39.738 --> 02:19:42.841 region:rollup2
SUBJECTED TO RETALIATION

02:19:41.240 --> 02:19:45.110 region:rollup2
ADDITIONALLY.

02:19:42.841 --> 02:19:47.446 region:rollup2
IT DOESN'T ALLOW THIS BODY TO

02:19:45.110 --> 02:19:48.647 region:rollup2
LOOK AT WILL WHAT WIRE THERE

02:19:47.446 --> 02:19:50.716 region:rollup2
THESE COMPLAINTS COMING OUT OF A

02:19:48.647 --> 02:19:52.084 region:rollup2
CERTAIN MEMBERS OFFICE HOW CAN

02:19:50.716 --> 02:19:53.585 region:rollup2
WE STEM THAT TIDE.

02:19:52.084 --> 02:19:56.288 region:rollup2
ARE TOSE VALID COMPLAINTS

02:19:53.585 --> 02:19:58.657 region:rollup2
INVALID COMPLAINTS.* SO IT

02:19:56.288 --> 02:20:00.058 region:rollup2
DOESN'T ALLOW. IT IN THIS BODY

02:19:58.657 --> 02:20:02.060 region:rollup2
TO TAKE ADEQUATE REMEDIAL

02:20:00.058 --> 02:20:03.328 region:rollup2
MEASURES TO ADDRESS IT SO I

02:20:02.060 --> 02:20:04.997 region:rollup2
THINK IT'S A WONDERFUL RESOURCE

02:20:03.328 --> 02:20:06.698 region:rollup2
I'M VERY HAPPY THAT IT'S IN

02:20:04.997 --> 02:20:09.268 region:rollup2
PLACE. BUT I THINK IT NEEDS SOME

02:20:06.698 --> 02:20:12.204 region:rollup2
TINKERING TO ALLOW IT TO BE A

02:20:09.268 --> 02:20:15.741 region:rollup2
PROTECTED ACTIVITY. OR TO SAY

02:20:12.204 --> 02:20:17.376 region:rollup2
VERY CLEARLY IF YOU GO TO WE.

02:20:15.741 --> 02:20:18.677 region:rollup2
YOU'RE NOT PROTECTED BY THE LAW.

02:20:17.376 --> 02:20:21.413 region:rollup2
YOU MAY GET A RESOURCE THAT'S

02:20:18.677 --> 02:20:23.515 region:rollup2
WONDERFUL ANY MAY GET RESOURCES

02:20:21.413 --> 02:20:25.517 region:rollup2
TO DEAL WITH TRAUMA YOU MAY GET

02:20:23.515 --> 02:20:26.618 region:rollup2
THERAPY THAT YOU NEED.

02:20:25.517 --> 02:20:28.587 region:rollup2
AND THAT HAS ITS OWN VALUE.

02:20:26.618 --> 02:20:29.121 region:rollup2
BUT.

02:20:28.587 --> 02:20:30.522 region:rollup2
THAT NEEDS TO BE STATED UP

02:20:29.121 --> 02:20:32.858 region:rollup2
FRONT.

02:20:30.522 --> 02:20:34.826 region:rollup2
THAT THAT I HAVE CERTAIN LEGAL

02:20:32.858 --> 02:20:36.128 region:rollup2
CONSEQUENCES AND ALLOWS THE

02:20:34.826 --> 02:20:37.629 region:rollup2
PERSON IN THAT SITUATION TO

02:20:36.128 --> 02:20:39.164 region:rollup2
DECIDE DO THEY WANT TO MAKE A

02:20:37.629 --> 02:20:40.766 region:rollup2
COMPLAINT.

02:20:39.164 --> 02:20:42.801 region:rollup2
AND BE COVERED UNDER THE LAW FOR

02:20:40.766 --> 02:20:43.802 region:rollup2
PROTECTED ACTIVITY WATERGATE

02:20:42.801 --> 02:20:45.137 region:rollup2
WANNA GET THERAPY NOT TALK ABOUT

02:20:43.802 --> 02:20:47.039 region:rollup2
IT AGAIN THEY CAN MAKE THAT

02:20:45.137 --> 02:20:48.874 region:rollup2
CHOICE BUT THEY OUGHT TO KNOW

02:20:47.039 --> 02:20:50.642 region:rollup2
THE CHOICE THAT MAKE.

02:20:48.874 --> 02:20:52.411 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE COMMENTS THANK YOU SO

02:20:50.642 --> 02:20:53.879 region:rollup2
MUCH. ONE OF THE COMMENTS HAVE

02:20:52.411 --> 02:20:55.647 region:rollup2
TO DO WITH.

02:20:53.879 --> 02:20:56.915 region:rollup2
KEEPING THE INVESTIGATION.

02:20:55.647 --> 02:20:58.317 region:rollup2
CONFIDENTIAL TOLD IT WAS A

02:20:56.915 --> 02:21:01.687 region:rollup2
FINDING.

02:20:58.317 --> 02:21:03.088 region:rollup2
GOES TO THE VERY PURPOSE OF OUR

02:21:01.687 --> 02:21:04.923 region:rollup2
JUDICIAL SYSTEM THAT OF DUE

02:21:03.088 --> 02:21:06.792 region:rollup2
PROCESS

02:21:04.923 --> 02:21:08.694 region:rollup2
IF YOU ARE BEING INVESTIGATED

02:21:06.792 --> 02:21:09.528 region:rollup2
THAT DOESN'T MEAN YOU ARE. HAVE

02:21:08.694 --> 02:21:11.096 region:rollup2
BEEN CONVICTED YOU ARE BEING

02:21:09.528 --> 02:21:13.031 region:rollup2
ACCUSED.

02:21:11.096 --> 02:21:15.400 region:rollup2
BOB HOW DO YOU BALANCE THAT HOW

02:21:13.031 --> 02:21:18.770 region:rollup2
DO YOU MAKE SURE THAT YOU DO

02:21:15.400 --> 02:21:20.772 region:rollup2
KEEP THESE INVESTIGATIONS.

02:21:18.770 --> 02:21:22.975 region:rollup2
A CONFIDENTIAL DURING THE

02:21:20.772 --> 02:21:24.276 region:rollup2
PROCESS SO THE TO DO PROTECT

02:21:22.975 --> 02:21:26.078 region:rollup2
BOTH THE VICTIM. AND OF THE

02:21:24.276 --> 02:21:27.646 region:rollup2
CUTEST.

02:21:26.078 --> 02:21:30.849 region:rollup2
I THINK THE THIRTY EXISTS UNDER

02:21:27.646 --> 02:21:32.517 region:rollup2
THE LAW MEANING EVEN IF I'VE

02:21:30.849 --> 02:21:34.186 region:rollup2
BEEN THE VICTIM OF A SEXUAL

02:21:32.517 --> 02:21:36.154 region:rollup2
HARASSMENT IN A MEMBER'S OFFICE.

02:21:34.186 --> 02:21:37.689 region:rollup2
I SHOULD BE ALLOWED AND LEGALLY

02:21:36.154 --> 02:21:38.724 region:rollup2
I AM ALLOWED TO TALK ABOUT THE

02:21:37.689 --> 02:21:40.625 region:rollup2
TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF MY

02:21:38.724 --> 02:21:42.928 region:rollup2
EMPLOYMENT. THAT'S DIFFERENT

02:21:40.625 --> 02:21:45.364 region:rollup2
THAN WHAT I STAND NEXT DAY TO

02:21:42.928 --> 02:21:47.833 region:rollup2
THE INVESTIGATOR IT MAY BE THE

02:21:45.364 --> 02:21:49.334 region:rollup2
EXACT SAME CIRCUMSTANCES BUT

02:21:47.833 --> 02:21:50.602 region:rollup2
THAT THERE'S A THERE'S A.

02:21:49.334 --> 02:21:52.237 region:rollup2
A DELINEATION THERE THAT I THINK

02:21:50.602 --> 02:21:54.573 region:rollup2
IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE. IF

02:21:52.237 --> 02:21:56.775 region:rollup2
I'M SAYING I REPORTED EXPLAINS

02:21:54.573 --> 02:21:58.610 region:rollup2
THE TO THE INVESTIGATOR WHILE

02:21:56.775 --> 02:21:59.644 region:rollup2
THE INVESTIGATION IS ONGOING

02:21:58.610 --> 02:22:01.446 region:rollup2
THAT COULD AFFECT OTHER

02:21:59.644 --> 02:22:02.981 region:rollup2
WITNESSES STATEMENTS.

02:22:01.446 --> 02:22:05.183 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT THE EXACT SAME

02:22:02.981 --> 02:22:06.818 region:rollup2
CIRCUMSTANCES BECAUSE IT IS THE

02:22:05.183 --> 02:22:08.787 region:rollup2
CONDITIONS THAT EXIST IN MY

02:22:06.818 --> 02:22:11.123 region:rollup2
WORKPLACE THAT'S LEGAL.

02:22:08.787 --> 02:22:12.657 region:rollup2
UNDER LABOR CODE. TWO THREE TWO

02:22:11.123 --> 02:22:14.459 region:rollup2
POINT FIVE AS WELL AS ANOTHER

02:22:12.657 --> 02:22:15.127 region:rollup2
AND ALL OUR BE DECISIONS SO I

02:22:14.459 --> 02:22:18.130 region:rollup2
THINK.

02:22:15.127 --> 02:22:19.631 region:rollup2
TRENT WANTING TO TAP DOWN ALL

02:22:18.130 --> 02:22:21.266 region:rollup2
DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE TERMS AND

02:22:19.631 --> 02:22:22.134 region:rollup2
CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT IS

02:22:21.266 --> 02:22:24.736 region:rollup2
ILLEGAL.

02:22:22.134 --> 02:22:25.871 region:rollup2
AND IS SEPARATE AND APART FROM

02:22:24.736 --> 02:22:28.306 region:rollup2
WHAT'S HAPPENING IN AN

02:22:25.871 --> 02:22:29.775 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATION.

02:22:28.306 --> 02:22:31.843 region:rollup2
BUT IF I MAY I I DO THINK I

02:22:29.775 --> 02:22:34.046 region:rollup2
TOUCHED UPON THIS AS WELL AS

02:22:31.843 --> 02:22:35.814 region:rollup2
COUNSEL FOR EMPLOYERS AND AS AS.

02:22:34.046 --> 02:22:37.582 region:rollup2
A NEUTRAL INVESTIGATOR FROM TIME

02:22:35.814 --> 02:22:39.651 region:rollup2
TO TIME HIRED BY OTHER.

02:22:37.582 --> 02:22:41.086 region:rollup2
EMPLOYMENT LAWYERS. IT IS

02:22:39.651 --> 02:22:42.988 region:rollup2
IMPERATIVE THAT THE INTEGRITY OF

02:22:41.086 --> 02:22:44.990 region:rollup2
AN INVESTIGATION BE PROTECTED

02:22:42.988 --> 02:22:47.159 region:rollup2
AND PART OF THAT IS TO KEEP

02:22:44.990 --> 02:22:48.827 region:rollup2
CONFIDENCES FOR PEOPLE TO USE

02:22:47.159 --> 02:22:50.729 region:rollup2
DISCRETION AND JUDGMENT WITH

02:22:48.827 --> 02:22:52.464 region:rollup2
RESPECT WHO THEY TALKED TO WHEN

02:22:50.729 --> 02:22:54.032 region:rollup2
THE INVESTIGATION IS ONGOING.

02:22:52.464 --> 02:22:56.635 region:rollup2
FOR THE VERY REASON THAT WE

02:22:54.032 --> 02:22:58.904 region:rollup2
DON'T WANT US STORIES OF

02:22:56.635 --> 02:23:01.506 region:rollup2
WITNESSES TO BE INFLUENCED BY

02:22:58.904 --> 02:23:03.008 region:rollup2
OTHER WITNESSES AND FOR THE VERY

02:23:01.506 --> 02:23:04.376 region:rollup2
REASON THAT WE WANT THE

02:23:03.008 --> 02:23:05.677 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATIVE PROCESS TO GO

02:23:04.376 --> 02:23:07.612 region:rollup2
FORWARD.

02:23:05.677 --> 02:23:08.814 region:rollup2
TOWARDS A REASONABLE CONCLUSION

02:23:07.612 --> 02:23:09.915 region:rollup2
BASED ON WHATEVER THE BURDEN OF

02:23:08.814 --> 02:23:11.416 region:rollup2
PROOF IS.

02:23:09.915 --> 02:23:12.751 region:rollup2
IN OUR WORLD IT'S THE

02:23:11.416 --> 02:23:15.220 region:rollup2
PREPONDERANCE OF THE EVIDENCE

02:23:12.751 --> 02:23:17.622 region:rollup2
YEARS AGO IS MY PANELISTS.

MAKO PANELIST AT HAS INDICATED

02:23:17.622 --> 02:23:20.058 region:rollup2
WE GOT A VERY STRANGE RULING

02:23:18.824 --> 02:23:22.127 region:rollup2
FROM THE AN HOUR BE

02:23:20.058 --> 02:23:23.662 region:rollup2
A BANNER CASE WHICH ESSENTIALLY

02:23:22.127 --> 02:23:24.629 region:rollup2
SAID THAT THE LONG STANDING

02:23:23.662 --> 02:23:26.298 region:rollup2
TRADITION OF INDEPENDENT

02:23:24.629 --> 02:23:28.767 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATORS.

02:23:26.298 --> 02:23:30.802 region:rollup2
GIVING WITNESSES INVESTIGATIONS

02:23:28.767 --> 02:23:31.636 region:rollup2
AN ADMONITION AND THAT THEY

02:23:30.802 --> 02:23:33.839 region:rollup2
SHOULD KEEP.

02:23:31.636 --> 02:23:35.774 region:rollup2
WHAT'S DISCUSSED WITH THE

02:23:33.839 --> 02:23:38.677 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATOR CONFIDENTIAL SO AS

02:23:35.774 --> 02:23:41.046 region:rollup2
NOT TO RUN THE RISK OF.

02:23:38.677 --> 02:23:43.448 region:rollup2
OF AT THE INTEGRITY THE

02:23:41.046 --> 02:23:45.383 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATION WAS A UNLAWFUL

02:23:43.448 --> 02:23:48.353 region:rollup2
PRACTICE UNDER SECTION SEVEN OF

02:23:45.383 --> 02:23:48.620 region:rollup2
THE NRA THAT HAS BECOME A VERY

02:23:48.353 --> 02:23:50.155 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT.

02:23:48.620 --> 02:23:52.290 region:rollup2
.

02:23:50.155 --> 02:23:53.625 region:rollup2
DECISION FOR INDEPENDENT

02:23:52.290 --> 02:23:54.993 region:rollup2
WORKPLACE INVESTIGATORS TO

02:23:53.625 --> 02:23:56.261 region:rollup2
GRAPPLE WITH THEY DIDN'T SAY

02:23:54.993 --> 02:23:57.996 region:rollup2
THAT YOU COULDN'T GIVE ANY

02:23:56.261 --> 02:23:59.130 region:rollup2
ADMONITIONS TO WITNESSES AND AN

02:23:57.996 --> 02:24:03.135 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATION IF YOU COULD

02:23:59.130 --> 02:24:05.103 region:rollup2
IDENTIFY ACTUAL TANGIBLE. RISKS

02:24:03.135 --> 02:24:07.472 region:rollup2
OF OTHER WITNESSES BEING

02:24:05.103 --> 02:24:09.007 region:rollup2
INFLUENCED AND YOU CAN GIVE THAT

02:24:07.472 --> 02:24:10.742 region:rollup2
ADMONITION YOU SHOULD NOT TALK

02:24:09.007 --> 02:24:12.144 region:rollup2
TO SO AND SO BECAUSE WE BELIEVE

02:24:10.742 --> 02:24:13.645 region:rollup2
THAT THERE'S A RISK.

02:24:12.144 --> 02:24:15.680 region:rollup2
BUT THE GENERAL OVERALL

02:24:13.645 --> 02:24:17.382 region:rollup2
STATEMENT OF PLEASE KEEP THINGS

02:24:15.680 --> 02:24:19.117 region:rollup2

02:24:17.382 --> 02:24:21.386 region:rollup2
AND DISCRETION OF THE BANNER

02:24:19.117 --> 02:24:23.121 region:rollup2
CASE SAID I WAS A VIOLATION OF

02:36:51.102 --> 02:36:54.038 region:rollup2
WHAT NOT LEAD ME TO BELIEVE THAT

THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO DO THIS IN

02:36:54.038 --> 02:36:57.008 region:rollup2
A TIMELY WAY I'M ADDING THAT

02:36:55.473 --> 02:36:58.676 region:rollup2
JUST BASED ON THE TESTIMONY THAT

02:36:57.008 --> 02:37:00.144 region:rollup2
HAPPENED TODAY?

02:36:58.676 --> 02:37:01.913 region:rollup2
AN APPEAL BOARD COULD REVIEW

02:37:00.144 --> 02:37:04.081 region:rollup2
DECISIONS IN THE EVENT THAT A

02:37:04.081 --> 02:37:08.386 region:rollup2

INVESTIGATION.

02:37:11.422 --> 02:37:14.859 region:rollup2
RECENTLY I'VE BEEN IN

02:37:13.224 --> 02:37:16.661 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION WITH NEIL MCCORMICK

02:37:14.859 --> 02:37:18.663 region:rollup2

SPECIAL DISTRICTS ASSOCIATION.

02:37:18.663 --> 02:37:22.833 region:rollup2

02:37:22.833 --> 02:37:27.271 region:rollup2
AND ANTI RETALIATION TRAINING.

02:37:26.037 --> 02:37:29.173 region:rollup2
AND I THINK BIAS TRAINING IS

02:37:27.271 --> 02:37:30.942 region:rollup2
ALSO EQUALLY IMPORTANT. THAT

02:37:29.173 --> 02:37:32.977 region:rollup2
INCLUDES BEST PRACTICES FOR

INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATIONS THERE

02:37:35.546 --> 02:37:38.082 region:rollup2
IS NO TRAINING LIKE THAT

CURRENTLY.

02:37:38.082 --> 02:37:42.586 region:rollup2
HOWEVER I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT

02:37:40.851 --> 02:37:45.022 region:rollup2
THAT IT'S NOT REASONABLE TO

02:37:42.586 --> 02:37:48.826 region:rollup2
EXPECT THAT LOCAL AGENCY

02:37:45.022 --> 02:37:50.661 region:rollup2

02:37:55.1000 --> 02:37:58.636 region:rollup2
