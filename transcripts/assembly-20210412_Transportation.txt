AND WORKING TOGETHER ON THIS MEASURE- WELL MUCH PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE. IN RECYCLING THESE MATERIALS ABOUT A MILLION TIMES ARE STILL SENT TO LANDFILLS. EACH YEAR. THIS BILL WILL REQUIRE THAT BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE CITIES AND COUNTIES ALLOW AT LEAST THE SAME PERCENTAGE OF RECYCLED MATERIALS FOR AGGREGATE BASE.

THAT'S RIGHT YOU HAVE TO THAT IS THAT CHARLIE RIGHT. THE CHARLIE RAY WITH THE CALIFORNIA CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRIAL MATERIALS ASSOCIATION. OR CALCIUM A FOR SHORT THE TRADE ASSOCIATION FOR COMPANIES THAT MAKE AGGREGATES ASPHALT AND CONCRETE. THESE ARE PRODUCTS ARE USED TO BUILD INFRASTRUCTURE INCLUDING ROADS BRIDGES RAIL TRANSIT BIKEWAYS AND WALKWAYS. THE MEMBER COMPANIES HAVE BEEN INCORPORATING RECYCLED CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS SUCH AS RECYCLED CONCRETE ASPHALT INTO THEIR PRODUCTS OVER THE LAST SEVERAL DECADES. THIS HELPS CONSERVE NATURAL RESOURCES KEEP HEAVY AND BULKY MATERIALS OUT OF LANDFILLS REVIEWS OF THE OIL AND CEMENT AND REDUCES GREENHOUSE GASES.CALTRANS HAS ALSO DEVELOPED. REGRESS AND THEN STANDARD SPECIFICATIONS GOING TO MULTI YEAR PROCESSES TO ALLOW THE USE OF RECYCLED MATERIALS AND PAVEMENTS WHILE MAINTAINING THE STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY OF CALTRANS PROJECTS. WHILE MANY CITIES AND COUNTIES USE THOSE SPECIFICATIONS A LOCAL PROJECTS OTHERS EITHER PROHIBIT OR LIMIT THE USE OF RECYCLED CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS. THIS BILL PROVIDES THAT BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE CITIES AND COUNTIES SHOULD HAVE SPECIFICATIONS EQUIPMENT TO CALTRANS STANDARD SPECIFICATION FOR THE USE OF RECYCLED MATERIALS AND ROAD BASE ASPHALT AND CONCRETE. THERE ARE THREE IMPORTANT THINGS I WANT TO NOTE ABOUT THE BILL ONE THAT THE RECYCLED MATERIALS WOULD ONLY NEED TO BE USED FOR THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT DETERMINES IT IS BOTH FEASIBLE AND COST EFFECTIVE. A TWO THE BILL ONLY APPLIES TO CURRENT OPERATING CALTRANS STANDARD SPECIFICATIONS. NOT ABOUT SPECIFICATIONS IN THE DEVELOPMENTAL OR TRIAL STAGE. AND THIRD IT ALLOWS FOR FUTURE CALTRANS STANDARD SPECIFICATIONS ON RECYCLED MATERIALS TO BE INCORPORATED. IN SUMMARY WE BELIEVE THIS BILL WILL ALLOW FOR AN ENVIRONMENTALLY RESPONSIBLE USE OF RECYCLED MATERIALS FOR PUBLIC WORKS PROJECTS.

AND PUT IT IN THE PUBLIC RESOURCES CODE WERE SIMILAR MEASURES HAVE GONE IN THE PAST AND SECOND AS THE ANALYSIS POINTS OUT AND WE THINK THE AMENDMENTS BETTER RECOGNIZE LOCAL FLEXIBILITY AND ENSURE THAT THIS ISN'T A DIRECT MANDATE TO ALWAYS USE THE STANDARDS BUT RATHER TO ENCOURAGE THEIR USE WHERE IT'S FEASIBLE AND COST EFFECTIVE- WILL BE EVALUATING THAT REVISED BILL I THINK OUR ONE REMAINING CONCERN IS REALLY ABOUT WHICH SIDE OF CALTRANS SPECIFICATIONS ARE WE TALKING ABOUT.

THANK IN THE CHAIR- AND COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THE THOUGHTFUL RECOMMENDATIONS AND FOR WORKING WITH MY TEAM ON THIS BILL I WILL BE ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS. AB NINE SEVENTY FOUR WILL REQUIRE MINERS TO WEAR A HELMET WHEN RIDING A HORSE AND REQUIRE REFLECTIVE GEAR- LIGHTS TO BE WORN BY WRITERS OR THEIR HORSES AT SUNDOWN. ON AN EVENING IN OCTOBER OF TWENTY NINETEEN A VEHICLE STRUCK TWO INDIVIDUALS RIDING THEIR HORSES IN LAKE VIEW TERRACE IN MY DISTRICT. THIS CRASH KILLED THE TWO HORSES AND LEFT THE TWO RIDERS IN CRITICAL CONDITION MEMBERS OF MY COMMUNITY WHICH YOU WILL HEAR FROM SHORTLY BROUGHT THE SAFETY CONCERNS TO MY ATTENTION. AFTER RESEARCHING THIS ISSUE WE FOUND SIMILAR COLLISIONS IN THE COMMUNITY OF SAUGUS AND WILTON CALIFORNIA IT IS NOT UNCOMMON THAT OF COURSE FOR HORSES TO SHARE THE ROADS WITH VEHICLES. HOWEVER IT CAN BE DIFFICULT FOR DRIVERS TO SEE RIDERS AND THEIR HORSES IN THE DARK WHEN THESE COLLISIONS OCCUR THE WRITERS ARE USUALLY THROWN OFF THEIR HORSES LEAVING THEM IN CRITICAL CONDITION. THE HORSES USUALLY DIE UPON COLLUSION OR MUST BE EUTHANIZED FROM THE INJURIES THAT THEY SUSTAINED AB NINE SEVENTY FOUR. IS A DISTRICT GENERATED PROPOSAL THAT WILL INCREASE THE VISIBILITY AND THE SAFETY OF BOTH OUR EQUINE ANIMALS AND WRITERS. I'M TODAY I HAVE TO CONSTITUENTS THAT ARE ACTIVE IN THE EQUINE COMMUNITY TO PROVIDE BRIEF TESTIMONY I HAVE GENE A CRUISE AND SHERRY BLOUSE. I THANK YOU VERY VERY MUCH- WE WILL START OPERATIVE WITH- WHICH INCLUDES. THANK YOU YOUR LINE IS OPEN. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS GINA CREATED I'M FROM THE COMMUNITY OF LAKE VIEW TERRACE. I'M HERE TO ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT AT EIGHT BE NINE SEVENTY FOUR I LIVE ON A RANCH NEAR THE QUESTION COMMUNITY AND THE FROM URBAN AREA OF THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES WITH MY FAMILY AND FIVE COURSES. LIKE MANY EQUESTRIANS WITH THE BERMAN AREAS MY DAUGHTER AND I REGULARLY RIDE OUR HORSES ON CITY STREETS IN ORDER TO ACCESS OUR LOCAL TRAIL. IT IS VERY COMMON TO SEE HORSES ON THE STREETS IN OUR COMMUNITY IN FACT MANY OF THE STREETS IN OUR COMUNITY ARE OFFICIALLY DESIGNATED EQUESTRIAN TRAIL. UNFORTUNATELY WE DON'T HAVE BEEN HERE SPINAL TAP ON THE STREET TO SEPARATE THE EQUESTRIAN FROM VEHICLE TRAFFIC. SO WE SHARE THE ROAD WITH VEHICLES. ABSOLUTE MENTIONED ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO THERE WAS A TERRIBLE ACCIDENT HERE ON A BUSY STREET INVOLVING A QUESTIONS IN A VEHICLE. TWO RIDERS WERE RIDING ALONG FOOTHILL BOULEVARD AT NIGHT WHEN THEY WERE STRUCK FROM BEHIND BY A VEHICLE. THE WRITERS WERE TRUMP AND THEREFORE TO THE WORKING NEARLY INJURED REQUIRING HOSPITALIZATION. BOTH PARTIES UNFORTUNATELY WERE KILLED. IF THE WRITERS HAVE BEEN WEARING REFLECTIVE GEAR IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THIS HORRIBLE ACCIDENT COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED. THIS IS NOT THE FIRST SUCH INCIDENT THAT HAPPENED HERE AND IT LIKELY WILL NOT BE THE LAST UNLESS CHANGES ARE MADE. MY DAUGHTER AND I WERE AT NIGHT WE ALWAYS VERIFY VESTS AND PUT REFLECTIVE GEAR ON THE MARKET. IF THE SMART THING TO DO NOT ONLY FOR THE SAFETY OF RIDERS AND HORSES BUT ALSO FOR DRIVERS. THANK YOU PS WHEN WE'RE ON THE ROAD AND AVOID A COLLISION. WE ALSO ALWAYS WEAR HELMET FOR A BRIDE. FOR THE FLIGHT ANIMAL IT DOESN'T TAKE MUCH TO POTENTIALLY PHYSICAL FORCE. IN IT THE WRITER COMES OFF THERE CAN BE SERIOUS RISK OF HEAD INJURY PARTICULARLY ONE FALLING ONTO A PAPER OUT. FOLLOW DON'T CAN MAKE THEIR OWN DECISION ON THE LEVEL OF RISK THEY WANT TO TAKE IT IS IMPORTANT THAT CHILDREN BE PROTECTED. BY REQUIRING THEY WEAR A HELMET WHEN RIDING ON THE STREET. I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME TODAY AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I VOTE. FOR EIGHTY NINE SEVENTY FOUR TO INCREASE THE SAFETY AND VISIBILITY EQUESTRIANS AND FORCES. WHEN WE ARE SHARING. THE ROAD WITH VEHICLES. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WE WILL NOW MOVE TO SAN. CINDY MAY PURSUE WHEN YOU'RE READY. THIS ISSUE RE CLOSE I NEED QUESTRADE AND REPRESENTATIVE FOR THIS BILL MAHER NEIGHBORHOOD COUNCIL AND I'VE BEEN ACTIVE IN THE EQUESTRIAN COMMUNITY AND SOME ARE FOR. OVER THIRTY YEARS AND I WANT TO PARAPHRASE EVERYTHING THAT WAS SAID RIGHT BEFORE ME IN SUPPORT OF AB NINE SEVENTY FOUR. ALL RIGHT IN THE STREETS IN THE EVENING IS TREACHEROUS- SO MARIN HAS ACCESS YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO ACCESS THE ROAD TO THE STREETS TO GET TO THE TRAILS AND- AND IT CAN BE VERY VERY DANGEROUS- WE'VE HAD SEVERAL ACCIDENTS IN SOLAAR WERE AGAIN FORCES AND THE WRITERS ARE ALWAYS THE LOSERS. REFLECTIVE GEAR IS SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE BEEN RECOMMENDING- BUT THERE'S BEEN NO ENFORCEMENT OF IT SO I THINK THAT IN PASSING THIS BILL IT WILL ENCOURAGE ALL OF THE RIDERS TO WHERE THEY IN FACT IT REFLECTIVE GEAR ON THEMSELVES AND ON THE HORSES. I STRONGLY RECOMMEND YOU VOTE FOR THIS. EIGHTY NINE SEVENTY FOUR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH- WE DON'T HAVE ANY OPPOSITION LIFTED- OPERATOR IS THERE ANYONE- I KNOW WHAT IT IS OPPOSITION SO- WE'LL NOW MOVE- I DON'T SEE ANYONE IN THE CHAMBERS- SPEAKING- WILLING WAITING TO SPEAK IS THERE ANYONE IN THE REMOTE.

THE PARTY MAY PERCEIVE ONE READY THANK YOU CARE AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I WANT TO START BY THANKING THE COMMITTEE STAFF- FOR OFFERING AMENDMENTS WHICH I GLADLY ACCEPT. AB EIGHT SIX THREE CLOSEST TO THE POLLS IN THE VEHICLE CODE TO ENSURE SAFETY FOR SOME OF THE MOST AFFORDABLE DRIVERS. ARE PERMIT HOLDERS. BEFORE MINERS AND SEEK THEIR DRIVER'S LICENSE. THEY FIRST MUST OBTAIN A LEARNER'S PERMIT. THE LEARNER'S PERMIT IS DESIGNED TO EQUIP OUR NEW YOUNG DRIVERSWITH THE FOUNDATIONAL SKILLS OF DRIVING WHO EXPERIENCES THE PROVISION. BEFORE THEY BEGIN TO DRIVE INDEPENDENTLY. THE PERMIT HOLDERS MUST BE ACCOMPANIED BY AN ADULT WHO POSSESSES A VALID CALIFORNIA DRIVER'S LICENSE. AND STANDS READY TO INTERVENE OR TAKE CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE IF NECESSARY. WELL THE SPIRIT OF EXISTING LAWS SURROUNDING LEARNER'S PERMIT. IS TO SPIN SURE THE SAFETY OF THE NEW DRIVER AND OTHERS WHO SHARE THE ROAD. CURRENT STATUTE DOES NOT REQUIRE THE IN COMPANY DRIVER TO BE IN THE FRONT SEAT MUCH LESS OVER. AB EIGHT SIX THREE CLOSES THESE LOOPHOLES NEW TEEN DRIVERS ARE OVER THREE TIMES MORE LIKELY TO BE INVOLVED. IN A CAR CRASH BECAUSE NEW DRIVERS ARE LESS LIKELY TO BE WRECKING. ARE LESS LIKELY TO RECOGNIZE DANGEROUS SITUATIONS ON THE ROAD AND EXPERIENCE IS A HUGE RISK FACTOR FOR TEEN DRIVERS. SUPERVISING A PERMIT HOLDER WHILE IMPAIRED PUTS THE DRIVING MINOR PASSENGERS AND OTHERS WHO SHARE THE ROAD. AS SERIOUS AND POTENTIALLY FATAL RISKS.-ACCORDING TO THE NATIONAL HIGHWAY TRAFFIC SAFETY ADMINISTRATION ABOUT TWENTY PEOPLE IN THE U. S. DIE IN DRUNK DRIVING CRASHES EVERY DAY. THAT'S ONE PERSON EVERY FIFTY TWO MINUTES. DRIVING UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF DRUGS OR ALCOHOL CLAIMS 30% OF ALL DEATHS ON CALIFORNIA ROADS. AND CHANGES LIVES FOREVER. JUST LAST YEAR THE CHP ISSUED OVER FORTY TWO THOUSAND DO YOU AYE CITATIONS. AB EIGHT SIX THREE REQUIRES A LICENSED DRIVER TO OCCUPY THE FRONT PASSENGER SEAT AND PROHIBITS BEING UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF DRUGS OR ALCOHOL. WHILE COMPANY HE PERMITTED DRIVER. AB EIGHT SIX AB EIGHT SIX THREE IS SUPPORTED BY MOTHERS AGAINST DRUNK DRIVING AND STATE BY LAW ENFORCEMENT GROUPS. YOU WITH ME TO TESTIFY TODAY IS COLOR PEARSON WHO IS A KERN COUNTY.

EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THESE CRASHES HOUSE DEVASTATING IMPACT ON VICTIMS FAMILY. AND EVERY SINGLE DRUNK DRIVING CRASH IS A 100% PREVENTABLE. UNFORTUNATELY DRUNK DRIVING IS NOT THE ONLY RECKLESS BEHAVIOR THAT MARK OUR ROADS. THERE HAS ALSO BEEN A STAGGERING INCREASE IN DRUG IMPAIRED DRIVING IN FACT 44% OF ALL DRIVERS IN FATAL CAR CRASHES TESTED POSITIVE FOR DRUG. THESE DRUGS MOST COMMONLY INCLUDE MARIJUANA COCAINE METHAMPHETAMINE AND OPIATES. TRAIN OUR NEXT GENERATION OF SAFE DRIVER STARTS WITH A LEARNER'S PERMIT. TEENAGERS ARE STILL LEARNING THE MECHANICS OF DRIVING VEHICLES AND ARE TOO OFTEN PLACED IN THE DANGEROUS AND UNCOMFORTABLE SITUATION OF BEING AFTER DR A PARENT OR AUTHORITY FIGURES. WHO IS UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF DRUGS AND ALCOHOL. IT I AM AN EXPERIENCED COMBINED WITH IMPAIRED SUPERVISION CAN BE A RECIPE FOR A DEADLY EXCHANGE.
