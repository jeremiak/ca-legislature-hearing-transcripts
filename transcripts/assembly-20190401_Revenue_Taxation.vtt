REALLY ENABLE ENCOURAGE AND SENT

00:34:36.641 --> 00:34:38.409
OUR INDUSTRY TO COME INTO THE

00:34:38.476 --> 00:34:39.844
REGULATED MARKET PLACE WHICH IS

00:34:39.911 --> 00:34:41.446
WHAT WE WANT THEM TO BE -- NOW

00:34:41.512 --> 00:34:43.047
YOU MIGHTASK BY LOWERING THE

00:34:43.114 --> 00:34:44.715
TAXES WHAT WILL THE IMPACT BE ON

00:34:44.782 --> 00:34:47.018
OUR TAX REVENUE WE BELIEVE THAT

00:34:47.084 --> 00:34:49.353
IT WILL RAISE TAX REVENUE HOW.

00:34:49.420 --> 00:34:50.655
IT SOMEWHAT COUNTERINTUITIVE BUT

00:34:50.721 --> 00:34:52.590
IT WORKS LIKE THIS BY LOWERING

00:34:52.657 --> 00:34:53.758
THE TAX RATE.

00:34:53.825 --> 00:34:55.760
OUT MORE FOLKS ARE ABLE TO PAY

00:34:55.827 --> 00:34:56.661
THE TAX AND WHEN YOU HAVE MORE

00:34:56.727 --> 00:34:58.129
PARTICIPANTS PAYING A TAX EVEN

00:34:58.196 --> 00:34:59.430
IF IT'S LOWER YOU HAVE A BIGGER

00:34:59.497 --> 00:35:01.165
TAX BASE AN OVERALL HIGHER TAX

00:35:01.232 --> 00:35:02.200
REVENUE.

00:35:02.266 --> 00:35:04.135
WE'VE SEEN THAT HAPPEN IN OTHER

00:35:04.202 --> 00:35:05.837
STATES IN STATES LIKE WASHINGTON --

00:35:05.903 --> 00:35:07.839
AND SO WE THINK THAT -- THE

00:35:07.905 --> 00:35:11.409
CONCERNS RAISED BY THAT -- THE

00:35:11.476 --> 00:35:12.477
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS BLOW

00:35:12.543 --> 00:35:14.045
PROJECTIONS OUT CAN BE ADDRESSED

00:35:14.111 --> 00:35:16.914
BY THIS BILL SO WE GET A TWO FOR

00:35:16.981 --> 00:35:18.049
IN A SENSE WE GET MORE CANNABIS

00:35:18.115 --> 00:35:20.184
INDUSTRY MEMBERS COMING INTO THE

00:35:20.251 --> 00:35:21.419
REGULAR MARKET PLACE AND WE GET

00:35:21.486 --> 00:35:22.887
GREATER REVENUE THAT COULD BE

00:35:22.954 --> 00:35:24.121
SPENT AND ALL THE GOOD THINGS.

00:35:24.188 --> 00:35:25.790
AT DECIMATED OUTLINED IN

00:35:25.857 --> 00:35:28.159
PROPOSITION SIXTY FOUR SO WE

00:35:28.226 --> 00:35:29.861
THINK THIS IS THE AS SENSIBLE

00:35:29.927 --> 00:35:31.796
BILL THAT WILL CREATE.

00:35:31.863 --> 00:35:33.564
A GREAT BENEFIT FOR OUR STATE.

00:35:33.631 --> 00:35:34.966
AND I WANT TO GIVE ASSEMBLY

00:35:35.032 --> 00:35:36.467

00:35:36.534 --> 00:35:38.169

00:35:44.575 --> 00:35:46.377
THANK YOU WELL LOT OF WHAT I

00:35:46.444 --> 00:35:48.112

00:35:51.015 --> 00:35:52.517
ALL DUE RESPECT FOR YOUR TIME

00:35:52.583 --> 00:35:53.017
I'M NOT GOING TO REPEAT

00:35:53.084 --> 00:35:54.285
EVERYTHING.

00:35:54.352 --> 00:35:56.988
BUT ESSENTIALLY -- WE HAVE A

00:35:57.054 --> 00:35:58.322
LIST OF MARKET THAT'S FOR A

00:35:58.389 --> 00:35:59.257
ROBUST HERE.

00:35:59.323 --> 00:36:01.726
AND QUITE FRANKLY THEY HAVE BEEN

00:36:01.792 --> 00:36:03.294
ENGAGED IN BEHAVIOR.

00:36:03.361 --> 00:36:06.364
AND MARKETING SENSE -- THE

00:36:06.430 --> 00:36:08.099
COMPASSIONATE.

00:36:08.165 --> 00:36:09.634
ACT.

00:36:09.700 --> 00:36:11.168
NINETEEN NINETY SIX AND SO

00:36:11.235 --> 00:36:13.971
THEY'RE VERY VERY -- SKILLED AND

00:36:14.038 --> 00:36:15.306
EXPERIENCED IN KNOWING HOW TO

00:36:15.373 --> 00:36:16.908
GET THE PRODUCT.

00:36:16.974 --> 00:36:18.409
INTO THE HANDS OF THE CONSUMER

00:36:18.476 --> 00:36:23.080
AND NOW WE HAVE -- PROP SIXTY

00:36:23.147 --> 00:36:24.916
FOUR WHICH WAS -- I THINK.

00:36:24.982 --> 00:36:26.717
SOMETHING THAT OF COURSE OUR

00:36:26.784 --> 00:36:28.219
PEOPLE WANTED AND SO WE NEED TO

00:36:28.286 --> 00:36:29.554
DO IT RESPONSIBLY AND

00:36:29.620 --> 00:36:31.355
UNFORTUNATELY THE DEMAND HAS NOT

00:36:31.422 --> 00:36:32.990
DIMINISHED BUT WHAT HAS.

00:36:33.057 --> 00:36:34.926
IS THE ABILITY TO COMPETE WITH

00:36:34.992 --> 00:36:36.360
THE ILLICIT MARKET WITH ALL

00:36:36.427 --> 00:36:37.762
THESE REGULATORY.

00:36:37.828 --> 00:36:41.165
COSTS AND EXPENSES AND A

00:36:41.232 --> 00:36:43.668
CIRCUMSTANCES THAT OF COURSE THE

00:36:43.734 --> 00:36:45.102
ILLICIT MARKET HAS NOT ENOUGH.

00:36:45.169 --> 00:36:46.437
AND SO WE'RE TRYING TO JUST

00:36:46.504 --> 00:36:48.339
EQUALIZE THE PLAYING FIELD AND

00:36:48.406 --> 00:36:49.840
ALL UNDERSTAND AND AND A MORE

00:36:49.907 --> 00:36:51.275
SIMPLER FORM.

00:36:51.342 --> 00:36:52.643
AND I BELIEVE THOSE WHO HAVE

00:36:52.710 --> 00:36:54.745
INVESTED HURT HEAVILY DESERVE TO

00:36:54.812 --> 00:36:56.847
BE SUPPORTED BY THIS TAX

00:36:56.914 --> 00:36:57.381
REDUCTION THIS REASONABLE

00:36:57.448 --> 00:36:58.849
APPROACH.

00:36:58.916 --> 00:37:00.751
SO THEY CAN COMPETE FAIRLY --

00:37:00.818 --> 00:37:01.886
THEY NEED TO BE REWARDED IN

00:37:01.953 --> 00:37:04.455
RIGHT NOW THEY ARE NOT AND SO WE

00:37:04.522 --> 00:37:06.457

00:37:06.524 --> 00:37:07.858
FOOTSTEPS OF THE STATE OF

00:37:07.925 --> 00:37:10.261
WASHINGTON -- THERE AN EXAMPLE

00:37:10.328 --> 00:37:11.996
ONCE THEY REDUCE THEIR RATES AND

00:37:12.063 --> 00:37:13.664
SIMPLIFY THEIR TAX.

00:37:13.731 --> 00:37:16.300
SYSTEM THEY INCREASED THEIR

00:37:16.367 --> 00:37:20.237
ABILITY -- TO TO GAIN.

00:37:20.304 --> 00:37:24.842
ACTUAL MONEY AND AND UP WE JUST

00:37:24.909 --> 00:37:25.376
NEED TO FOLLOW THAT SIMPLE

00:37:25.443 --> 00:37:26.944

00:38:52.129 --> 00:38:53.631
FIFTEEN OR 20% OF THAT.

00:38:53.698 --> 00:38:55.966
THE TAX REVENUE IS IS IS VERY

00:38:56.033 --> 00:38:58.769
LARGE IN COMPARISON -- WE NEED

00:38:58.836 --> 00:38:59.503

INSIDE OF THE REGULATED INDUSTRY --

00:39:20.758 --> 00:39:21.926
THE AMOUNT OF TAX DOLLARS

00:39:21.992 --> 00:39:25.396
