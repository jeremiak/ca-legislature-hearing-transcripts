TWO REASONS THAT I CAN THINK OF-

00:08:31.244 --> 00:08:32.912
THE FIRST REASON IS IT IS IT IS

00:08:32.979 --> 00:08:34.747
A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE INDUSTRY-

00:08:34.814 --> 00:08:36.048
ALTHOUGH IT IS GROWING HERE IN

00:08:36.115 --> 00:08:39.685
CALIFORNIA- THERE'S NO. SORT OF.

00:08:39.752 --> 00:08:41.988
INHERENT REASON WHY IT SHOULD BE

00:08:42.054 --> 00:08:43.022
HERE IN CALIFORNIA EXCEPT FOR

00:08:43.089 --> 00:08:44.757
HUMAN INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE

00:08:44.824 --> 00:08:47.894
OTHER- INCENTIVES THAT REMAIN

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:49.295
HERE IN CALIFORNIA THE COULD

00:08:49.362 --> 00:08:50.897
MOVE THE TAXES THAT COULD MOVE

00:08:50.963 --> 00:08:52.064
THE NUMBER OF OTHER. OTHER

00:08:52.131 --> 00:08:54.967
AREAS- THE SECOND REASON IS THIS

00:08:55.034 --> 00:08:57.436
IS AN EXISTING TAX CREDIT BY

00:08:57.503 --> 00:08:59.538
BASICALLY DISALLOWING IT ONE IT

00:08:59.605 --> 00:09:01.807
CREATES CONFUSION. BUT TO IT

00:09:01.874 --> 00:09:03.376
SENDS A VERY STRONG MESSAGE THAT

00:09:03.442 --> 00:09:09.282
TELL. IS ANTAGONISTIC IF WE IF

00:09:09.348 --> 00:09:10.449
WE BASICALLY REVERSAL DONE THE

00:09:10.516 --> 00:09:12.118
PAST WE DEMONSTRATE THAT WERE

00:09:12.184 --> 00:09:14.120
ACTUALLY ANTAGONISTIC. TO THE

00:09:14.186 --> 00:09:16.088
INDUSTRY AND SO- RATHER THAN

00:09:16.155 --> 00:09:17.924
SEND THAT MESSAGE I SUGGEST THAT

00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:19.625
WE- EXTEND THE CREDIT THAT

00:09:19.692 --> 00:09:21.360
CURRENTLY EXISTS. AND IT'S

00:09:21.427 --> 00:09:23.396
RELATIVELY LIMITED EXPANSION AS

00:09:23.462 --> 00:09:26.332
TO- FACILITIES ARE ON THE GROUND

00:09:26.399 --> 00:09:30.202
IN THIRDLY I SUPPOSE- IT WOULD

00:09:30.269 --> 00:09:31.537
SEEM A BIT BIZARRE IF WE START

00:09:31.604 --> 00:09:33.639
TAXING THINGS IN SPACE AND

00:09:33.706 --> 00:09:35.308
ABSENT I AM INFORMED ABSENT THIS

00:09:35.374 --> 00:09:37.009
TAX CREDIT WOULD ACTUALLY BE.

00:09:37.076 --> 00:09:40.546
TAXING PERSONAL PROPERTY ONCE

00:09:40.613 --> 00:09:41.881
FROM CALIFORNIA THAT'S IN SPACE

00:09:41.948 --> 00:09:46.385
. THIRTY NIELSEN. WELL YOU KNOW

00:09:46.452 --> 00:09:48.154
THIS STATE PRIDES ITSELF WITH

00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:49.956
BEING AT THE VANGUARD AND

00:09:50.022 --> 00:09:51.457
CERTAINLY THIS IS AN AREA WHERE

00:09:51.524 --> 00:09:53.392
WE HAVE BEEN AND SHOULD REMAIN

00:09:53.459 --> 00:09:56.562
THE VANGUARD. AND I'M NOT THE

00:09:56.629 --> 00:09:59.565
GREATEST FAN OF TAX CREDITS. BUT

00:09:59.632 --> 00:10:02.134
THEY HAVE THEIR PLACE. AND THIS

00:10:02.201 --> 00:10:04.337
IS MORE THAN SYMBOLIC I

00:10:04.403 --> 00:10:07.606
CONSIDERED SUBSTANTIVE. THE COST

00:10:07.673 --> 00:10:12.078
OF THIS INDUSTRY ARE INCREDIBLE

00:10:12.144 --> 00:10:14.313
. AND THE RISKS THEY TAKE ARE

00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:17.316
LIKEWISE INCREDIBLE. BUT THEN SO

00:10:17.383 --> 00:10:19.318
ARE THE BENEFITS I THINK OF A

00:10:19.385 --> 00:10:21.087
HOLE IN THAT INDUSTRY BASED IN

00:10:21.153 --> 00:10:23.656
THE STATE. CONTINUE OUR

00:10:23.723 --> 00:10:27.059
LEADERSHIP POSITION. NOBODY FROM

00:10:27.126 --> 00:10:27.927
THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS

00:10:27.994 --> 00:10:29.362
ASSOCIATION SHOWED UP THERE TO

00:10:29.428 --> 00:10:31.931
TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION BUT I'M

00:10:31.998 --> 00:10:32.999
INCREDULOUS THAT THEY OPPOSED

00:10:33.065 --> 00:10:35.001
THIS. AND I'D LIKE THEM TO COME

00:10:35.067 --> 00:10:37.837
AND EXPLAIN WHY IN THE WORLD.

00:10:37.903 --> 00:10:41.207
THEY HAVE AN INTEREST. IN THIS

00:10:41.273 --> 00:10:45.244
OPPOSING THIS BILL. CENDRILLON

00:10:45.311 --> 00:10:46.245
BURKE I HAVE DELIGHTED TO

00:10:46.312 --> 00:10:47.847
SUPPORT YOUR LEGISLATION THANK

00:10:47.913 --> 00:10:52.785
YOU SIR. WELL I JUST HAVE TO-

00:10:52.852 --> 00:10:54.720
AGREE THAT- YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA

00:10:54.787 --> 00:10:56.255
HAS BEEN ON THE VANGUARD MY

00:10:56.322 --> 00:10:57.823
FATHER WORKED IN THE AEROSPACE

00:10:57.890 --> 00:11:00.326
INDUSTRY AND SO I REMEMBER WHEN-

00:11:00.393 --> 00:11:03.696
THEY WERE MAJOR- COMPANIES THAT

00:11:03.763 --> 00:11:05.498
HIRED ENGINEERS THAT DID THE

00:11:05.564 --> 00:11:07.733
WORK HERE. AND THAT ALSO DID

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:10.036
THAT THE TESTING RIGHT OUT ON

00:11:10.102 --> 00:11:13.873
THE AIR AIRFORCE BASE- AND A LOT

00:11:13.939 --> 00:11:16.375
OF THAT LEFT WHEN WE LEFT THERE.

00:11:16.442 --> 00:11:19.378
THE SPACE RACE- I DID HAVE A

00:11:19.445 --> 00:11:21.213
OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH THE

00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:22.181
COMPANIES THAT ARE DOING THIS

00:11:22.248 --> 00:11:24.417
WORK AND MY ASK THE SAME

00:11:24.483 --> 00:11:27.053
QUESTIONS WHY DO YOU NEED THIS.

00:11:27.119 --> 00:11:29.055
I'M QUITE FRANKLY THERE BEING-

00:11:29.121 --> 00:11:30.990
ENCOURAGED TO MOVE TO OTHER

00:11:31.057 --> 00:11:32.158
STATES WHERE THEY'RE THEY'RE

00:11:32.224 --> 00:11:38.898
BEING GIVEN- CREDITS BENEFITS-

00:11:38.964 --> 00:11:42.068
MONEY AND- AND I THINK THIS IS

00:11:42.134 --> 00:11:43.369
ONE OF THE INDUSTRY'S WE REALLY

00:11:43.436 --> 00:11:45.371
NEED TO KEEP HER BECAUSE- THEY

00:11:45.438 --> 00:11:48.007
HAVE THE DATE ALTHOUGH IT'S

00:11:48.074 --> 00:11:50.609
LOCATED IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA-

00:11:50.676 --> 00:11:54.747
THAT THE LIST OF SUPPLIERS. IS

00:11:54.814 --> 00:11:57.049
STATEWIDE AND THEY'RE JUST AS

00:11:57.116 --> 00:12:00.219
MANY- SUPPLIERS OF TALENT AND

00:12:00.286 --> 00:12:01.487
EQUIPMENT FROM NORTHERN

00:12:05.925 --> 00:12:07.560
ONE OF THOSE- TAX CREDITS TO

00:12:07.626 --> 00:12:09.962

00:12:17.736 --> 00:12:19.238

00:14:14.987 --> 00:14:17.590
EXCISE TAXES WOULD BE TIME TO

00:14:17.656 --> 00:14:19.358
SAIL. THE BILL HAS BEEN A LONG

00:14:19.425 --> 00:14:21.293
TIME COMING AS CALIFORNIA HAS A-

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:23.162
STORAGE IN CHALLENGE HISTORY ON

00:14:23.229 --> 00:14:25.097
CAMPUS WHICH WE DON'T HAVE TIME

00:14:25.164 --> 00:14:26.232
TO GET INTO BUT THE BOTTOM LINE

00:14:26.298 --> 00:14:28.300
IS THIS IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN.

00:14:28.367 --> 00:14:30.269
CALIFORNIA VOTERS APPROVED PROP

00:14:30.336 --> 00:14:31.303

MEDICINAL USE CANNABIS

00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:44.216
ACTIVITIES- BUT- THE CHALLENGE

00:14:44.283 --> 00:14:47.086
WITH PROP SIXTY FOUR IT PUT THE

00:14:47.152 --> 00:14:48.053
STATE UNDER SOME RIDICULOUS.

00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:49.855

00:14:51.123 --> 00:14:52.925
MEET MEANT THAT THE STATE HAS TO

00:14:52.992 --> 00:14:55.294
BUILD THE PLANE. AS WE ARE

00:14:55.361 --> 00:14:56.595
FINDING. A WHILE WE'VE TRIED TO

00:14:56.662 --> 00:14:58.664
FIX ALL THE ISSUES WERE PROP

00:14:58.731 --> 00:15:00.165
SIXTY FOUR SINCE HIS PASSAGE. OF

00:15:00.232 --> 00:15:01.800
ONE OF THE BIGGEST REMAINING

00:15:01.867 --> 00:15:04.403
CHALLENGES IS THE TAX STRUCTURE.

00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:05.070
THE PRODUCTS A SIXTY FOUR

00:15:05.137 --> 00:15:07.273
CONTAIN TO SPECIFIC TO THIS.

00:15:07.339 --> 00:15:09.575
ADDRESS THE EXCISE TAX IS WELLS

00:15:09.642 --> 00:15:11.176
THE CULTIVATION TAX. AND THE

00:15:11.243 --> 00:15:13.779
EXCISE TAX IS AT A SEPT FIFTEEN

00:15:13.846 --> 00:15:15.614
PERCENT. OF THE GROSS RECEIPT OF

00:15:15.681 --> 00:15:17.483
ANY CANNABIS OR CANNABIS

00:15:17.549 --> 00:15:19.285
PRODUCTS. AT THE TIME OF SALE.

00:15:19.351 --> 00:15:20.953
THE CULTIVATION TAX IS WEIGHT

00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:23.756
BASED ITS CHARGE PER OUNCE ON

00:15:23.822 --> 00:15:26.258
HARVESTED CANNABIS. SO CURRENTLY

00:15:26.325 --> 00:15:30.095
THE CHALLENGE. WITH THE

00:15:30.162 --> 00:15:31.230
CULTIVATION TAXES. IT DOESN'T

00:15:31.297 --> 00:15:33.265
ACCOUNT FOR WHEN PRICE OF

00:15:33.332 --> 00:15:34.700
CANNABIS. IN PRICES HAVE DROPPED

00:15:34.767 --> 00:15:36.068
CONSIDERABLY MORE THAN HALF IN

00:15:36.135 --> 00:15:37.503
THE LAST FEW YEARS. IN THE

00:15:37.569 --> 00:15:39.938
CULTIVATION TAX PER WEIGHT

00:15:40.005 --> 00:15:42.975
REMAINS THE SAME REMAINS FIXED

00:15:43.042 --> 00:15:45.110
WHICH IS CAUSING AN ENORMOUS TAX

00:15:45.177 --> 00:15:48.347
BURDEN- IN REGARDS TO SMALL

00:15:48.414 --> 00:15:50.449
FAMILY GROWERS. IN THIS

00:15:50.516 --> 00:15:51.650
SITUATION DOESN'T HAPPEN WITH

00:15:51.717 --> 00:15:53.986
THE EXCISE TAX BECAUSE IT'S A

00:15:54.053 --> 00:15:55.888
PERCENTAGE OF THE SALES PRICE.

00:15:55.954 --> 00:15:58.090
SO CULTIVATION TAXES ARE

00:15:58.157 --> 00:15:59.591
CRUSHING SMALL FARMERS

00:15:59.658 --> 00:16:01.393
THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THE SMALL

00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:03.295
GROWERS HAVE TRIED TO COME INTO

00:16:03.362 --> 00:16:04.396
THE REGULATED MARKET THEY'VE

00:16:04.463 --> 00:16:06.799
DONE EVERYTHING RIGHT. AS SET UP

00:16:06.865 --> 00:16:08.567
IN PROP SIXTY FOUR WELL

00:16:08.634 --> 00:16:09.968
COMPETING AGAINST THE BLACK

00:16:10.035 --> 00:16:11.970
MARKET. THE BLACK MARKET ISN'T

00:16:12.037 --> 00:16:13.539
FOLLOWING THE ENVIRONMENTAL

00:16:13.605 --> 00:16:16.141
HEALTH AND SAFETY RULES AS

00:16:16.208 --> 00:16:17.976
ESTABLISH PER CALIFORNIA VOTERS.

00:16:18.043 --> 00:16:19.478
AND UNLIKE ANY OTHER

00:16:19.545 --> 00:16:21.313
AGRICULTURAL CROP IN CALIFORNIA

00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:23.615
CANNABIS IS EXTENSIVELY TAX AT

00:16:23.682 --> 00:16:25.718
THE FARM HE MATCHING IF WE HAD

00:16:25.784 --> 00:16:27.619
TO PAY THIS FOR TOMATOES OR A-

00:16:27.686 --> 00:16:29.421
HEAD OF LETTUCE OR CARROTS. THIS

00:16:29.488 --> 00:16:30.889
IS CREATING A DOWNWARD TREND OF

00:16:30.956 --> 00:16:32.424
CANNABIS FARMERS BECAUSE TEY

00:16:32.491 --> 00:16:34.460
SIMPLY CAN'T COMPETE WITH THE

00:16:34.526 --> 00:16:35.260
BLACK MARKET IN COMMERCIAL

00:16:35.327 --> 00:16:38.263
CANNABIS. THE TAX BURDEN IS

00:16:38.330 --> 00:16:39.298
GROWING DISPROPORTIONATELY.

00:16:39.365 --> 00:16:41.200
INVEST PRICE COLLAPSE AND IT'S

00:16:41.266 --> 00:16:43.268
SIMPLY NOT SUSTAINABLE FOR THE

00:16:43.335 --> 00:16:44.236
VAST MAJORITY OF CANNABIS

00:16:44.303 --> 00:16:47.840
FARMERS OUT THERE WHO ARE SMALL

00:16:47.906 --> 00:16:49.174
FAMILY FARMERS. SB TEN SEP.

00:16:49.241 --> 00:16:51.243
EIGHT EXISTING WEIGHT BASE CAMP.

00:16:51.310 --> 00:16:52.211
FISHING TAX IN ROLE THE

00:16:52.277 --> 00:16:54.179
CANNABIST A STATE CANNABIS TAXES

00:16:54.246 --> 00:16:56.782
INTO A SINGLE PERCENTAGE BASE

00:16:56.849 --> 00:16:58.784
EXCISE TAX. SO THIS KEEPS IT

00:16:58.851 --> 00:17:02.321
ESSENTIALLY WHERE THE- SAID- AT

00:17:02.388 --> 00:17:05.224
THE SAME TAX RATE. SB TEN

00:17:05.290 --> 00:17:06.592
SEVENTY FOUR ALSO TEMPORARILY

00:17:06.658 --> 00:17:08.894
SUSPENDS THE CULTIVATION TAX.

00:17:08.961 --> 00:17:10.696
FULLY UNTIL JULY FIRST TO THE

00:17:10.763 --> 00:17:14.600
TWENTY. IN TOUCH FOR TWENTY SIX

00:17:14.666 --> 00:17:15.834
IF THE LEGISLATURE. MONEY AS PER

00:17:15.901 --> 00:17:17.136
OF THE BUDGET PROCESS THE TAX

00:17:17.202 --> 00:17:18.904
REDUCTION IS PART OF BUDGET

00:17:18.971 --> 00:17:21.807
CONVERSATIONS EVEN AS WE SPEAK

00:17:21.874 --> 00:17:23.041
IN ITS ONGOING WITH THE

00:17:23.108 --> 00:17:24.443
ADMINISTRATION I DON'T THINK I'M

00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:25.878
LETTING THE CAT OF THE BAG IS.

00:17:25.944 --> 00:17:28.213
AT THIS IS BEEN ONGOING FOR

00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:29.314
WEEKS NOW AND I AM HOPEFUL THAT

00:17:29.381 --> 00:17:31.617
A DEAL WILL BE REALIZED IN THE

00:17:31.683 --> 00:17:33.919
COMING FEW WEEKS. NOW I WANT TO

00:17:33.986 --> 00:17:35.554
CLARIFY THAT A COUPLE OF ITEMS

00:17:35.621 --> 00:17:36.789
THAT YOU MAY HAVE HEARD ABOUT

00:17:36.855 --> 00:17:38.157
THE BILL WHICH I WILL

00:17:38.223 --> 00:17:38.957
CHARACTERIZE IS A BIT OF HOG

00:17:39.024 --> 00:17:41.727
WASH. OUT FIRST- THAT I'VE HEARD

00:17:41.794 --> 00:17:43.896
SOME SAY THAT IF THERE WILL BILL

00:17:43.962 --> 00:17:45.330
PASSES THE STATE IS GOING TO

00:17:45.397 --> 00:17:46.965
HAVE TO CUT PROGRAMS SUPPORTED

00:17:47.032 --> 00:17:49.268
BY CANNABIS TAXES. THIS IS NOT

00:17:49.334 --> 00:17:51.170
TRUE. SO IT IS ALWAYS BEEN OUR

00:17:51.236 --> 00:17:52.638
INTENTION TO MAKE SURE THAT

00:17:52.704 --> 00:17:53.806
THOSE PROGRAMS WERE NOT

00:17:53.872 --> 00:17:56.208
IMPACTED. AND TO MAKE IT SUPER

00:17:56.275 --> 00:17:57.876
CLEAR WE'VE AMENDED THE BILL TO

00:17:57.943 --> 00:17:59.478
MAKE SURE. THAT ANY REDUCTION IN

00:17:59.545 --> 00:18:01.246
TAXES CAN ONLY OCCUR IF THE

00:18:01.313 --> 00:18:03.315
LEGISLATURE APPROPRIATES AS PART

00:18:03.382 --> 00:18:05.150
OF BUDGET CONVERSATIONS. ABOUT

00:18:05.217 --> 00:18:07.653
TO. BEGIN ADMINISTRATION RETURN

00:18:07.719 --> 00:18:10.355
GRATEFUL FOR. IS ENGAGING ON THE

00:18:10.422 --> 00:18:13.091
SUBJECT EVEN AS WE SPEAK. NOW IF

00:18:13.158 --> 00:18:14.893
NO FUNDS ARE APPROPRIATED. THE

00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:16.128
CANNABIS TAX INSULT

00:18:16.195 --> 00:18:17.095
CONSOLIDATION GOES INTO A

00:18:17.162 --> 00:18:20.866
SINGLE. STATE EXCISE TAX WHICH

00:18:20.933 --> 00:18:22.534
WOULD BE REVENUE NEUTRAL. AND

00:18:22.601 --> 00:18:24.136
THE REASON FOR THAT IS THE

00:18:24.203 --> 00:18:25.204
CULTIVATION TAX WOULD GO TO

00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:27.940
ZERO. IN THE EXCISE TAX IS

00:18:28.006 --> 00:18:29.908
ADJUSTED TO BRING IN THIS EXACT

00:18:29.975 --> 00:18:32.711
SAME TAX REVENUE BUT IT TIME TO

00:18:32.778 --> 00:18:35.013
SAIL. AT THE RETAIL SIDE. WE

00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:36.448
WOULD NOT SEE A REDUCTION IN

00:18:36.515 --> 00:18:38.317
TAXES COMING IN CONSUMERS WOULD

00:18:38.383 --> 00:18:42.287
NOT BE PAYING MORE IN TAXES THEY

00:18:42.354 --> 00:18:44.423
IF WE DON'T SEE THE BACKFILL.

00:18:44.490 --> 00:18:45.757
SECOND WE'VE ALSO HEARD A

00:18:45.824 --> 00:18:47.526
CONCERN THAT THERE SHOULD BE IN

00:18:47.593 --> 00:18:50.395
L. L. A. O. STUDY IMPACTS. I

00:18:50.462 --> 00:18:52.364
FOCUS ON THE IMPACTS OF ANY TAX

00:18:52.431 --> 00:18:54.900
CHANGE. I WILL BE I AM BIASED.

00:18:54.967 --> 00:18:56.468
THERE HAVE BEEN STUDY AFTER DAM

00:18:56.535 --> 00:18:59.071
STUDY AFTER STUDY ON CANNABIS

00:18:59.137 --> 00:19:01.006
TAXES IN CANNABIS IN THE STATE

00:19:01.073 --> 00:19:02.975
OVER THE YEARS IN ON EVERY MAJOR

00:19:03.041 --> 00:19:05.410
CANNABIS POLICY. IN CANDIDLY WE

00:19:05.477 --> 00:19:07.012
GOT TO IMPLEMENT WITH THE VOTER

00:19:07.079 --> 00:19:08.514
SAID WE NEEDED EMPLOYMENT BACK

00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:11.450
IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN LASTLY

00:19:11.517 --> 00:19:12.251
WE'VE HEARD THAT ANY TAX CHANGES

00:19:12.317 --> 00:19:13.719
SHOULD BE TEMPORARILY. AND WHILE

00:19:13.785 --> 00:19:15.354
THE BILL OUTLINES A TEMPORARY

00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:16.588
FRAMEWORK FOR REDUCING OVERALL

00:19:16.655 --> 00:19:18.790
TAX BURDEN I HAVE TO DISAGREE

00:19:18.857 --> 00:19:21.159
THAT WE WOULD ONLY TEMPORARY GET

00:19:21.226 --> 00:19:21.960
RID OF THE CULTIVATION TAX

00:19:22.027 --> 00:19:24.463
FRAMEWORK IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT

00:19:24.530 --> 00:19:25.264
STATES THAT ARE NOW

00:19:25.330 --> 00:19:26.064
IMPLEMENTING. A CULTIVATION

00:19:26.131 --> 00:19:27.833
TAXES AS WE SEE NOW OVER HALF OF

00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:29.835
ALL STATES IN THE UNITED STATES

00:19:29.902 --> 00:19:30.569
AMERICA EITHER RECREATIONAL OR

00:19:30.636 --> 00:19:32.404
MEDICINAL USE. THEY ARE NOT

00:19:32.471 --> 00:19:33.372
LOOKING AT A WEIGHT BASED

00:19:33.438 --> 00:19:34.540
CULTIVATION TAX BECAUSE IT

00:19:34.606 --> 00:19:36.575
SIMPLY DOESN'T WORK IN IT

00:19:36.642 --> 00:19:38.744
CRUSHES A SMALL FAMILY FARMERS.

00:19:38.810 --> 00:19:43.015
FINALLY HOW TO SAY THIS. SB TEN

00:19:43.081 --> 00:19:44.816

00:19:44.883 --> 00:19:45.384

REVISING CANNABIS TAXES TO A

00:19:47.085 --> 00:19:48.587
SINGLE PERCENTAGE BASE EXCISE

00:19:48.654 --> 00:19:50.923
TAX. IT SUPPORTED BY RURAL

00:19:50.989 --> 00:19:51.924
COUNTIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF

00:38:42.053 --> 00:38:42.920
BUT YOU CAN'T LEGALLY BUY IT

00:38:42.987 --> 00:38:45.990
ANYWHERE. AND THEN IMPOSING 25%

00:38:46.057 --> 00:38:47.391
AND STATE TAXES AND THEN

00:38:47.458 --> 00:38:50.194
WHATEVER LOCALS DECIDE TO DO SO

00:38:50.261 --> 00:38:51.328
THIRTY THIRTY FIVE PERCENT. HAS

00:38:51.395 --> 00:38:53.431
MADE TEN OF US NOT JUST HARD TO

00:38:53.497 --> 00:38:55.566
ACCESS BUT HAS MADE IT VERY

00:38:55.633 --> 00:38:56.500
EXPENSIVE. TO PURCHASING LEGAL

00:38:56.567 --> 00:38:59.970
CANNABIS IS WAY TOO EXPENSIVE-

00:39:00.037 --> 00:39:03.941

OPPOSITION TO COME TO THE NORTH

00:43:12.389 --> 00:43:13.223
COAST. THE VAST MAJORITY ARE

00:43:13.290 --> 00:43:14.224
SMALL FAMILY FARMERS THEY'VE

00:43:14.291 --> 00:43:15.926
LITERALLY BEEN FARMING CANNABIS

00:43:15.993 --> 00:43:17.027
FOR DECADES LONGER THAN I'VE

00:43:17.094 --> 00:43:19.496

00:43:19.563 --> 00:43:21.198
ON THE VINE. WE HAVE A MAJOR

00:43:21.265 --> 00:43:23.100

OUT IN THE BUDGET. AND THEN I

00:43:29.873 --> 00:43:32.042
THINK A BIG PICTURE WE MAY NEED

00:43:32.109 --> 00:43:34.078
TO GO BACK TO THE VOTERS HERE AS

00:43:34.144 --> 00:43:36.480
THE INDUSTRY MATURES. THAT'S WHY

00:43:36.547 --> 00:43:38.549

00:43:38.615 --> 00:43:39.883
CAUGHT MY OWN EDITORIAL LONG

00:43:39.950 --> 00:43:43.787
TERM. SENATOR NELSON. THANK YOU

00:43:43.854 --> 00:43:46.890
MADAM CHAIR. I'M A FAN OF THE

00:43:46.957 --> 00:43:49.093
AUTHOR. IN THE AREA THAT HE

00:43:49.159 --> 00:43:50.594
REPRESENTS PARTICULARLY BECAUSE

00:43:50.661 --> 00:43:53.163
I REPRESENTED A GOOD PORTION OF

00:43:53.230 --> 00:43:55.532
IT MYSELF. I'VE NOT BEEN A FAN

00:43:55.599 --> 00:43:57.101
OF CANNABIS IN FACT IN THE

00:43:57.167 --> 00:43:59.169
EIGHTIES- AUTHORED THE CAMP

00:43:59.236 --> 00:44:03.207
PROGRAM TO STAMP OUT MARIJUANA.

00:44:03.273 --> 00:44:05.409
THE TRAIN'S LEFT THE STATION.

00:44:05.476 --> 00:44:07.111
WHAT HAS NOT LEFT THE STATION IS

00:44:07.177 --> 00:44:09.880
THAT BLACK MARKET THAT INSIDIOUS

00:44:09.947 --> 00:44:13.550
BLACK MARKET. VERY DANGEROUS

00:44:13.617 --> 00:44:17.287
BLACK MARKET. AND I DO HAVE

00:44:17.354 --> 00:44:18.622
SYMPATHY FOR THOSE WHO ARE

00:44:18.689 --> 00:44:22.259
LEGITIMATELY TRY. STRIVING. TO

00:44:22.326 --> 00:44:26.697
GROW THE MARKET MARIJUANA. THEN

00:44:26.764 --> 00:44:28.832
I STIPULATE THE MERIT OF. THE

00:44:28.899 --> 00:44:31.201
USE OF MARIJUANA FOR CERTAIN

00:44:31.268 --> 00:44:34.338
PURPOSES. SO WITH KIND OF

00:44:34.405 --> 00:44:37.875
SETTING ASIDE MY HISTORIC IN THE

00:44:37.941 --> 00:44:40.377
BIASES I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A

00:44:40.444 --> 00:44:42.813
GOOD STEP FORWARD FOR THE TIMES

00:44:42.880 --> 00:44:45.215
THAT WE ARE EXPERIENCING NOW I

00:44:45.282 --> 00:44:47.551
THANK THE AUTHOR AND I WILL

00:44:47.618 --> 00:44:48.152

MUCH- I AM I WANT AGREE WITH MY

00:44:52.189 --> 00:44:54.725
WITH MY COLLEAGUES I THINK THIS

00:44:54.792 --> 00:44:56.894
IS- TO TAX. CULTIVATION DOESN'T

00:44:56.960 --> 00:45:00.230
MAKE ANY SENSE- BUT- WE ARE

00:45:00.297 --> 00:45:02.032
BUILDING THIS AIRPLANE AS AS WE

00:45:02.099 --> 00:45:03.500
FLY IT AND THAT'S THE DIFFICULTY

00:45:03.567 --> 00:45:05.035
AND I DO THINK WE'RE PROBABLY

00:45:05.102 --> 00:45:07.271
GONNA HAVE TO GO BACK TO THE

00:45:07.337 --> 00:45:07.871
VOTERS AND ASK THEM FOR

00:45:07.938 --> 00:45:09.106
PERMISSION TO CHANGE SOME OF

00:45:09.173 --> 00:45:13.043
THE- ELEMENTS OF. THE ORIGINAL-

00:45:13.110 --> 00:45:15.312
OF THE ORIGINAL- PROPOSITION I

00:45:15.379 --> 00:45:16.880
IT'S PART OF THE PROBLEM WITH

00:45:16.947 --> 00:45:18.082
PROPOSITIONS IS THAT ONCE YOU

00:45:18.148 --> 00:45:20.284
GET IT. ONCE YOU PUT IT DOWN ON

00:45:20.350 --> 00:45:24.154
PAPER. IF THE REALITY CHANGES-

00:45:24.221 --> 00:45:26.123
AND SOCIETY CHANGES YOU GOT TO

00:45:26.190 --> 00:45:28.192
GO BACK TO THE VOTERS AND YOU'RE

00:45:28.258 --> 00:45:30.127
SO YOU'RE STUCK WITH THE DETAILS

00:45:30.194 --> 00:45:30.928
AND SO. WE'RE LEARNING AND I

00:45:30.994 --> 00:45:32.796
THINK- BECOMING A LITTLE BIT

00:45:32.863 --> 00:45:34.298
WISER AND DOES THIS MAKE SENSE

00:45:34.364 --> 00:45:36.100
AND I APPRECIATE THAT THIS IS

00:45:36.166 --> 00:45:37.768
GOING TO GET TAKEN CARE OF IN

00:45:37.835 --> 00:45:42.606
THE BUDGET AND- YOUR FOCUS ON.

00:45:42.673 --> 00:45:45.542
MOVING AWAY FROM TAXATION AT THE

00:45:45.609 --> 00:45:48.846
POINT OF- AT THE END OF A

00:45:48.912 --> 00:45:50.447

SEEING MORE WORK ON IT CLEARLY

00:45:55.953 --> 00:45:58.088
MORE WORK NEEDS TO BE DONE SO WE

00:45:58.155 --> 00:45:59.623

CONSTITUENTS TO BE WONDERING WHY

00:50:01.198 --> 00:50:02.866
THIS LEGISLATURE WOULD ALLOW

00:50:02.933 --> 00:50:04.301
TAXES TO BE INCREASED ON

00:50:04.368 --> 00:50:05.969

00:50:10.273 --> 00:50:12.008
THAT THIS YEAR'S INCREASE WHAT

00:50:12.075 --> 00:50:13.243
IF THIS YEAR'S INCREASE LOOKS

00:50:13.310 --> 00:50:15.645
LIKE BUT NEXT YEAR IT COULD BE

00:50:15.712 --> 00:50:17.647
EVEN WORSE IN MARCH IN THE

01:02:06.923 --> 01:02:09.025
TRANSPORTATION THIS IS A VERY

01:02:09.092 --> 01:02:11.694
EXTREME. MEASURE THIS ISN'T EVEN

01:02:11.761 --> 01:02:12.862
MORE I MEAN I DON'T LIKE TO

01:02:12.929 --> 01:02:15.264
THINK IT WAS PROPOSING WHICH IS

01:02:15.331 --> 01:02:17.200
A ONE YEAR- THE LADY OF THE- OF

01:02:17.266 --> 01:02:19.235
THE INFLATION ADJUSTMENT THIS IS

01:02:19.302 --> 01:02:22.071
A PERMANENT ELIMINATION OF- THE

01:02:22.138 --> 01:02:24.407
INFLATIONARY- COST OF LIVING

01:02:24.474 --> 01:02:26.976
ADJUSTMENT- FOR THE GAS TAX AND

01:02:27.043 --> 01:02:30.813
SO WHAT THAT MEANS IT'S A HALF A

01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:32.148
BILLION THIS YEAR. CLOSE TO A

01:02:32.215 --> 01:02:33.916
DEAL NEXT AND NOT WILL COMPOUND.

01:02:33.983 --> 01:02:35.451
OVER TIMES OVER THE NEXT DECADE

01:02:35.518 --> 01:02:37.487
DISABILITY BILLIONS AND BILLIONS

01:02:37.553 --> 01:02:39.789
AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. THAT

01:02:39.856 --> 01:02:41.724
WOULD HAVE BEEN INVESTED IN

01:02:41.791 --> 01:02:43.860
RESURFACING ROADS IN FIXING

01:02:43.926 --> 01:02:46.929
STATE HIGHWAYS AND IN SHORING UP

01:02:46.996 --> 01:02:48.564
OUR PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION

01:02:48.631 --> 01:02:51.334
SYSTEMS MEMBERS WE'RE TALKING

01:02:51.400 --> 01:02:52.969
OVER TIME TENS OF BILLIONS OF

01:02:53.035 --> 01:02:54.904
DOLLARS. JUST SUCKED OUT OF THE

01:02:54.971 --> 01:02:57.406
INFRASTRUCTURE OF THIS STATE AND

01:02:57.473 --> 01:02:59.675
THAT MEANS ROADS WILL BE BUMPIER

01:02:59.742 --> 01:03:02.812
MORE. OUR CARS WILL BE DAMAGED

01:03:02.879 --> 01:03:05.414
BY KREDI ROADS- WE WILL HAVE

01:03:05.481 --> 01:03:07.016
MORE OF THOSE HORRIBLE POTHOLES

01:03:07.083 --> 01:03:08.851
ON THE STATE'S HIGHWAYS THAT

01:03:08.918 --> 01:03:10.253
CALTRANS WON'T HAVE THE

01:03:10.319 --> 01:03:11.888
RESOURCES AFFECTS. AND PEOPLE

01:03:11.954 --> 01:03:13.890
WHO RELY ON BUS SERVICE OR

01:03:13.956 --> 01:03:15.558
SERVICE OR TRAIN SERVICE TO GET

01:03:15.625 --> 01:03:16.859
TO WORK OR WHEREVER THEY'RE

01:03:16.926 --> 01:03:18.327
GOING WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO WAIT

01:03:18.394 --> 01:03:20.429
LONGER I HAVE BY. WORSE

01:03:20.496 --> 01:03:23.599
EXPERIENCES- AND SO THIS IS NOT

01:03:23.666 --> 01:03:25.635
JUST SOME MINOR TEN. PIECE FOR

01:03:25.701 --> 01:03:28.171
WHILE WE HIKED GAS PRICES THAT

01:03:28.237 --> 01:03:30.006
SEEM TO BE. USING A MAYBE COMING

01:03:30.072 --> 01:03:32.575
DOWN THIS IS NOT TEMPORARILY.

01:03:32.642 --> 01:03:37.413
THIS IS A PERMANENT WRECKING

01:03:37.480 --> 01:03:41.417
BALL TO OUR ABILITY AS A STATE

01:03:41.484 --> 01:03:45.388
TO. WE ARE. DR SYSTEM ARMS THIS

01:03:45.454 --> 01:03:47.490
IS A VERY SEVERE VERY HARMFUL

01:03:47.557 --> 01:03:50.326
WHY ARE TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS

01:03:50.393 --> 01:03:52.195
AND SUCH ABOUT **** BAD SHAPE

01:03:52.261 --> 01:03:53.896
PEOPLE GET VERY FRUSTRATED AND

01:03:53.963 --> 01:03:55.932
LIKE- WE WILL PASS THE GAS TAX

01:03:55.998 --> 01:03:57.133
INCREASE IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND

01:03:57.200 --> 01:03:58.935
WE STILL HAVE ROADS THAT ARE IN

01:03:59.001 --> 01:04:01.070
BAD SHAPE AND HIGHWAYS SO YOU

01:04:01.137 --> 01:04:02.138
MUST NOT BE DOING ANYTHING THE

01:04:02.205 --> 01:04:05.341
REASON IS BECAUSE FOR THIRTY

01:04:05.408 --> 01:04:08.611
YEARS THIS STATE WAS DENIED

01:04:08.678 --> 01:04:11.180
BUDGETS GET PASSED TAX AND-

01:04:11.247 --> 01:04:12.748
THIRTY YEARS AT THE CLUB. IN

01:04:12.815 --> 01:04:15.084
REAL VALUE ABOUT 50% DIDN'T GO

01:04:15.151 --> 01:04:16.419
UP BY INFLATION FROM THE EARLY

01:04:16.485 --> 01:04:19.222
NINETIES UNTIL YOU KNOW ABOUT

01:04:19.288 --> 01:04:22.758
FIVE YEARS AGO- AND SO WE REALLY

01:04:22.825 --> 01:04:24.493
ALLOWED ARE TRANSFERRED TO HAVE

01:04:24.560 --> 01:04:27.096
A STRUCTURE TO DETERIORATE AND

01:04:27.163 --> 01:04:29.198
WE ARE DIGGING OUT OF DEEP OR

01:04:29.265 --> 01:04:31.367
NOT YOU CAN'T DO IT TO YOUR IT

01:04:31.434 --> 01:04:32.735
TAKES TIME THE LAST THING WE

01:04:32.802 --> 01:04:34.237
SHOULD BE DOING IS SHOOTING

01:04:34.303 --> 01:04:35.905
OURSELVES BUT BY SUCKING

01:04:35.972 --> 01:04:38.608
ALTERNATELY TENS OF BILLIONS OF

01:04:38.674 --> 01:04:42.211
DOLLARS OUT OF OURS. PREDATION

01:04:42.278 --> 01:04:43.980
BOND- I ALSO THINK IT'S REALLY A

01:04:44.046 --> 01:04:46.215
MA'AM OF THE TO DOWN THERE'S A

01:04:46.282 --> 01:04:48.918
OF MESS. GOING NOT NOT JUST IN

01:04:48.985 --> 01:04:50.853
THIS HEARING BUT FROM YOU KNOW

01:04:50.920 --> 01:04:52.421
I'M NOT JUST FROM REPUBLICANS.

01:04:52.488 --> 01:04:53.990
ODDS THE TRAGICALLY FROM SOME

01:04:54.056 --> 01:04:58.361
DEMOCRATS TO- DIED- IF WE TRUST

01:04:58.427 --> 01:05:00.263
THE SPENDER LOWER THE GAS TAX

01:05:00.329 --> 01:05:03.199
YOUR GAS PRICES ARE GONNA GO

01:05:03.266 --> 01:05:05.101
DOWN I DON'T THINK THAT'S TRUE.

01:05:05.167 --> 01:05:06.102
GAS GAS TAXES ARE NOT BEING

01:05:06.168 --> 01:05:07.970
DRIVEN ACHIEVEMENT GAS PRICES

01:05:08.037 --> 01:05:10.006
ARE NOT BEING DRIVEN BY WEATHER

01:05:10.072 --> 01:05:11.974
YOU KNOW WE HAVE THIS OR THAT

01:05:12.041 --> 01:05:14.010
GAS TAX. IS BEING DRIVEN BY THE

01:05:14.076 --> 01:05:16.412
OIL COMPANIES. I'M TO BLAME THE

01:05:16.479 --> 01:05:18.948
BITE IN ADMINISTRATION FOR YOU

01:05:19.015 --> 01:05:21.851
KNOW SOME OF CONSTRAINING OIL

01:05:21.917 --> 01:05:23.352
SUPPLY AND WE HAVE SO MANY.

01:05:23.419 --> 01:05:24.754
FEDERAL GAS LEASE OR WILL WE

01:05:24.820 --> 01:05:26.389
SAYS IT WILL COMPANIES AREN'T

01:05:26.455 --> 01:05:29.191
EVEN USING Y. FOR THEIR OWN

01:05:29.258 --> 01:05:30.559
BOTTOM LINE BECAUSE THEY THEY

01:05:30.626 --> 01:05:32.228
DON'T WANT TO HAVE AN OVER

01:05:32.295 --> 01:05:33.095
SUPPLIED DATA WILL COMPANIES

01:05:33.162 --> 01:05:35.197
BENEFIT. FROM HAVING HIGH GAS

01:05:35.264 --> 01:05:37.633
PRICES AND SO THEY DON'T HAVE AN

01:05:37.700 --> 01:05:39.201
INCENTIVE TO TRY TO CONSTRAIN

01:05:39.268 --> 01:05:41.804
THAT- AND TO MAKE PEOPLE PAY

01:05:41.871 --> 01:05:44.607
MORE THE GUY AT THE PUMP. THAT

01:05:44.674 --> 01:05:45.308
IS IT WILL COMPANIES CATERING TO

01:05:45.374 --> 01:05:47.109
THEIR SHAREHOLDERS THEY DON'T

01:05:47.176 --> 01:05:49.045
CARE ABOUT THE PEOPLE CALIFORNIA

01:05:49.111 --> 01:05:52.548
WILL COMPANIES DON'T CARE. IF

01:05:52.615 --> 01:05:55.017
SOMEONE WHO IS LOW INCOME HAS TO

01:05:55.084 --> 01:05:57.253
PAY MORE AT THE PUMP TO GET THE

01:05:57.320 --> 01:05:58.521
WORK BUILT COMPANIES COULD CARE

01:05:58.587 --> 01:06:00.790
LESS ABOUT THAT. THEY CARE ABOUT

01:06:00.856 --> 01:06:03.426
PLEASING THEIR SHAREHOLDERS AND

01:06:03.492 --> 01:06:04.994
THAT'S WHY THEY ARE KEEPING THE

01:06:05.061 --> 01:06:06.962
PRICES HIGH. AND WE COULD

01:06:07.029 --> 01:06:09.031
ELIMINATE THE STATE GAS TAX

01:06:09.098 --> 01:06:11.267
TOMORROW AND THAT IS NO

01:06:11.334 --> 01:06:13.069
GUARANTEE BUT GAS PRICES WILL GO

01:06:13.135 --> 01:06:15.104
DOWN AT ALL. AND THE DEBT WILL

01:06:15.171 --> 01:06:16.872
COMPANIES ARE JUST AS LIKELY TO

01:06:16.939 --> 01:06:19.842
STOP POCKET THE DIFFERENCE. AND

01:06:19.909 --> 01:06:21.911
WE WILL BE SUBSIDIZING THE OIL

01:06:21.977 --> 01:06:24.480
COMPANIES SO THIS IS I THINK A

01:06:24.547 --> 01:06:26.349
MISREPRESENTATION OF THE PUBLIC

01:06:26.415 --> 01:06:28.117
TO SAY THAT DO THAT PASSING THIS

01:06:28.184 --> 01:06:30.486
BILL OR LOWERING GAS TAXES. IS

01:06:30.553 --> 01:06:32.254
GOING TO LOWER YOUR GAS PRICES

01:06:32.321 --> 01:06:35.858
PROBABLY WON'T. BUT WHAT IT WILL

01:06:35.925 --> 01:06:37.827
DO IS MAKE YOU HAVE TO GO TO MY-

01:06:37.893 --> 01:06:39.362
MORE. WHEN YOUR CAR GETS DAMAGED

01:06:39.428 --> 01:06:40.930
BECAUSE WERE SUCKING TENS OF

01:06:40.996 --> 01:06:42.031
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OUT OF ROAD

01:06:42.098 --> 01:06:44.166
RESURFACING HIGHWAY REPAIRS. AND

01:06:44.233 --> 01:06:47.136
BUS AND TRAIN SERVICE SO I AM

01:06:47.203 --> 01:06:48.337
OPPOSED TO THIS BILL I'M VOTING

01:06:48.404 --> 01:06:50.906
NO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- YOUR

01:06:50.973 --> 01:06:53.175
EYES ON. IT WE'RE GOING TO GO

01:06:53.242 --> 01:06:55.010
THROUGH THE COMMENTS AND THEN

01:06:55.077 --> 01:06:56.045
WE'RE GOING TO GIVE YOU AN

01:06:56.112 --> 01:06:57.246
OPPORTUNITY BECAUSE WE COULD.

01:06:57.313 --> 01:07:02.551
SENATOR EYES THANK YOU- I DO-

01:07:02.618 --> 01:07:05.621
NUMBER A COMMON THE AUTHOR FOR

01:07:05.688 --> 01:07:08.090
RAISING THE ISSUE OF WHAT. IT IS

01:07:08.157 --> 01:07:10.126
THAT POOR AND MIDDLE INCOME

01:07:10.192 --> 01:07:11.327
PEOPLE ARE GOING THROUGH WITH

01:07:11.394 --> 01:07:13.929
GAS PRICES- I THINK IT'S

01:07:13.996 --> 01:07:16.665
TERRIBLE THAT THE GAS PRICES ARE

01:07:16.732 --> 01:07:19.368
BEING INCREASED AS MUCH AS THEY

01:07:19.435 --> 01:07:21.804
ARE. MY PROBLEM WITH WITH THE

01:07:21.871 --> 01:07:23.305
BILL IS THAT THERE IS NO

01:07:23.372 --> 01:07:26.442
GUARANTEE THAT THOSE PRICES WILL

01:07:26.509 --> 01:07:28.511
GO DOWN. IF WE ELIMINATE THE AND

01:07:28.577 --> 01:07:31.614
INFLATION IN THE GAS IN THE GAS

01:07:31.680 --> 01:07:34.183
TAX THAT'S THE REAL PROBLEM AND

01:07:34.250 --> 01:07:35.451
I DON'T WANT TO REPEAT

01:07:35.518 --> 01:07:36.485
EVERYTHING THE CENTER WIENER

01:07:36.552 --> 01:07:39.021
SAID BUT- IF THERE WAS RELIEF

01:07:39.088 --> 01:07:41.323
AND IT WAS SIGNIFICANT ENOUGH. I

01:07:41.390 --> 01:07:43.292
WOULD COUNTERBALANCE THAT WITH

01:07:43.359 --> 01:07:45.428
OKAY WE WILL BE LOSING FIVE

01:07:45.494 --> 01:07:46.262
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS THE

01:07:46.328 --> 01:07:48.030
FIRST YEAR ALMOST BILLION

01:07:48.097 --> 01:07:51.300
DOLLARS THE NEXT YEAR- WHAT DOES

01:07:51.367 --> 01:07:53.202
THAT MEAN IN TERMS OF LOSS OF

01:07:53.269 --> 01:07:55.137
JOBS. LOST TO BUSINESSES THAT

01:07:55.204 --> 01:07:57.306
RELY ON THESE ON ON THIS-

01:07:57.373 --> 01:08:00.242
INVESTMENT. THROUGH IN BALANCING

01:08:00.309 --> 01:08:02.445
THE TWO I DON'T SEE ONE THAT

01:08:02.511 --> 01:08:05.848
THE- REGULAR WORKING PEOPLE.

01:08:05.915 --> 01:08:09.084
NEED TO GAS UP THEIR CARS AND

01:08:09.151 --> 01:08:11.053
TRUCKS TO GET TO WORK I DON'T

01:08:11.120 --> 01:08:12.988
SEE HOW THEY GET THE RELIEF SO

01:08:13.055 --> 01:08:15.524
THAT'S THE PRIMARY REASON. THAT

01:08:15.591 --> 01:08:17.726
I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL

01:08:17.793 --> 01:08:21.096
THANK YOU. VERY GOOD- TO SAY

01:08:21.163 --> 01:08:23.599
THAT THAT- THAT MANY OF THE

01:08:23.666 --> 01:08:25.267
THINGS MY COLLEAGUES HAVE SAID-

01:08:25.334 --> 01:08:27.670
RIGHT IBM. ARE TRUE ABILITY I

01:08:27.736 --> 01:08:29.705
GUESS I SEE THIS A LITTLE BIT

01:08:29.772 --> 01:08:32.641
DIFFERENTLY AND- TO THE EXTENT

01:08:32.708 --> 01:08:33.909
THAT- THE GOVERNOR'S TALKED

01:08:33.976 --> 01:08:36.245
ABOUT. GAS TAX RELIEF THE

01:08:36.312 --> 01:08:37.813
PRESIDENT HAS TALKED ABOUT GAS

01:08:37.880 --> 01:08:39.815
TAX RELIEF I THINK IT'S

01:08:39.882 --> 01:08:40.282
IMPORTANT TO HAVE THE

01:08:40.349 --> 01:08:42.284
CONVERSATION CONTINUE UNTIL WE

01:08:42.351 --> 01:08:43.819
FINALLY ADOPT BUDGETS AND WE CAN

01:08:43.886 --> 01:08:45.254
FIGURE OUT WHAT KIND OF RELIEF

01:08:45.321 --> 01:08:47.423
FOR GONNA. GIVE TO THE

01:08:47.490 --> 01:08:50.693
TAXPAYERS- BUT ALSO I THINK

01:08:50.759 --> 01:08:52.328
THERE THERE ARE ALWAYS SEE

01:08:52.394 --> 01:08:55.831
ISSUES POLICY POSITIONS THAT WE

01:08:55.898 --> 01:08:56.532
TAKE HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE.

01:08:56.599 --> 01:09:00.836
THAT THAT MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR

01:09:00.903 --> 01:09:02.204
PEOPLE TO TRAVEL THAT HAVE

01:09:02.271 --> 01:09:04.773
NOTHING TO DO WITH THE TAP THAT

01:09:04.840 --> 01:09:06.242
THE TAX BEING THERE THE TAX NOT

01:09:06.308 --> 01:09:09.144
BEING THERE WHEN WE START-

01:09:09.211 --> 01:09:13.649
FOCUSING ON- ELECTRIC VEHICLES

01:09:13.716 --> 01:09:15.150
WERE IGNORING THE FACT THAT THEY

01:09:15.217 --> 01:09:16.719
USE THE ROAD THE CLOG THE

01:09:16.785 --> 01:09:18.487
HIGHWAYS BUT THEY DON'T PAY INTO

01:09:18.554 --> 01:09:21.323
A SYSTEM- AND WHEN WE START

01:09:21.390 --> 01:09:22.691
LOOKING AT VEHICLE MILES

01:09:22.758 --> 01:09:26.729
TRAVELED WHICH IS- PENALTY ON

01:09:26.795 --> 01:09:27.997
COMMUNITIES THAT ARE THING

01:09:28.063 --> 01:09:29.932
HOUSING- AND THEY'RE TRYING TO

01:09:29.999 --> 01:09:30.900
BUILD HOUSING FOR THEIR

01:09:30.966 --> 01:09:32.134
WORKFORCE BUT ACTUALLY ARE

01:09:32.201 --> 01:09:33.068
BUILDING HOUSING FOR SOMEONE

01:09:33.135 --> 01:09:34.703
ELSE'S WORKFORCE WHO'S TRAVELING

01:09:34.770 --> 01:09:36.071
LONG DISTANCES WE DON'T

01:09:36.138 --> 01:09:39.108
RECOGNIZE IT. THOSE INDIVIDUALS

01:09:39.174 --> 01:09:40.609
THAT ARE TRAVELING THOSE REALLY

01:09:40.676 --> 01:09:41.777
LONG DISTANCES WHAT BETTER ROADS

01:09:41.844 --> 01:09:43.279
AND THEY WANT WIDER ROADS AND

01:09:43.345 --> 01:09:46.148
BIGGER ROADS AND WE'VE MADE THE

01:09:46.215 --> 01:09:48.117
COMMITMENT IN CALIFORNIA NOT TO

OTHER AND I THINK THIS THIS

01:10:02.798 --> 01:10:04.967
WHOLE ISSUE I HAVE TO AGREE THAT

01:10:05.034 --> 01:10:07.002
I'M NOT SURE THAT REDUCING THE

01:10:07.069 --> 01:10:09.371
TAX. IS GOING TO BENEFIT THE

01:10:09.438 --> 01:10:10.306
INDIVIDUALS THAT WE THINK IT'S

01:10:10.372 --> 01:10:11.807
GOING TO BENEFIT BUT THERE'S A

01:10:11.874 --> 01:10:13.375
DISCUSSION GOING ON RIGHT NOW

01:10:13.442 --> 01:10:15.277

THIS AND- AND- AND I THINK THAT

01:10:57.353 --> 01:11:00.122
THAT LOOKING AFTER THE PEOPLE

01:11:00.189 --> 01:11:01.790
THAT ARE THE LEAST THE LEAST.

01:11:01.857 --> 01:11:03.726
ABLE TO PAY THE HIGH PRICES IS

01:11:03.792 --> 01:11:05.160
REALLY IMPORTANT IN THE STATE

TO MOVE FORWARD I WOULD

01:11:22.177 --> 01:11:23.112
APPRECIATE IT I DON'T THINK

01:11:23.178 --> 01:11:25.447
THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN SOME JUST

01:11:25.514 --> 01:11:26.415
GONNA RESPOND TO A COUPLE OF.

01:11:26.482 --> 01:11:28.317
COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE TO TRY

01:11:28.384 --> 01:11:29.184
TO CORRECT THE RECORD SO

01:11:29.251 --> 01:11:29.852
OBVIOUSLY MY COLLEAGUE FROM LOS

01:11:29.918 --> 01:11:31.453
ANGELES IS TAKING THEIR CUES

01:11:31.520 --> 01:11:32.121
FROM MY COLLEAGUE FROM

01:11:32.187 --> 01:11:35.157
SACRAMENTO. AND I WANT YOU TO BE

01:11:35.224 --> 01:11:37.726
REASSURED THAT OPEC SETS THE OIL

01:11:37.793 --> 01:11:40.262
PRICE RIGHT TEXAS AT SOME RANDOM

01:11:40.329 --> 01:11:42.164
OIL COMPANY IN KERN COUNTY OR

01:11:42.231 --> 01:11:43.032
ANYWHERE ELSE DOESN'T JUST

01:11:43.098 --> 01:11:44.333
RANDOMLY GO ON MEDICAL CHARGE

01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:45.934
THIS AMOUNT OF MONEY SO OPEC ON

01:11:46.001 --> 01:11:48.537
A WORLD VIEW SETS THE OIL PRICES

01:11:48.604 --> 01:11:49.171
AND THEN THAT'S FILTERED DOWN

01:11:49.238 --> 01:11:51.040
THE UNITED STATES- IN EVERYWHERE

01:11:51.106 --> 01:11:52.775
THAT USES OIL. THE SECOND THING

01:11:52.841 --> 01:11:56.311
IS THAT OIL COMPANIES SELL TO

01:11:56.378 --> 01:11:56.912
REFINERIES THAT REFINE OIL THE

01:11:56.979 --> 01:11:59.114
CELL GET. THAT GASOLINE IS

01:11:59.181 --> 01:12:01.483
RETAILER LIKE A VALERO OR A

01:12:01.550 --> 01:12:03.118
CHEVRON GAS STATION MUCH LIKE

01:12:03.185 --> 01:12:05.187
WE'RE EITHER ANY OF PERSON ON

01:12:05.254 --> 01:12:07.222
THE DIESS WOULD GET THEIR GAS IS

01:12:07.289 --> 01:12:09.258
THAT GAS RETAILER IS NOT

01:12:09.324 --> 01:12:11.493
REQUIRED TO PAY THE ADDITIONAL

01:12:11.560 --> 01:12:13.529
TAX TO THE CITY CALIFORNIA EVERY

01:12:13.595 --> 01:12:15.664
GALLON OF GAS THAT THEY SELL.

01:12:15.731 --> 01:12:16.832
THE PRICE WILL AUTOMATICALLY

01:12:16.899 --> 01:12:18.834
DROP FOR EVERY GALLON OF GAS

01:12:18.901 --> 01:12:21.236
IT'S KIND OF LIKE AS AN EMPLOYER

01:12:21.303 --> 01:12:23.105
EVERY QUARTER W HAVE TO FILL

01:12:23.172 --> 01:12:25.507
OUT A D. E. SIX WE TAKE TAXES

01:12:25.574 --> 01:12:26.175
OUT OF AN EMPLOYEE'S CHECK. WE

01:12:26.241 --> 01:12:28.177
BALANCE THAT WITH R. D. E. SIX

01:12:28.243 --> 01:12:30.245
WE MATCH ON SOME OF THOSE TAXES

01:12:30.312 --> 01:12:31.747
AN EMPLOYER TAX MATCHING THE

01:12:31.814 --> 01:12:36.151
RECENT A FORM. YEAH THE STATE.

01:12:36.218 --> 01:12:37.086

01:12:37.152 --> 01:12:38.987
TAKE THE- OUT OF MY EMPLOYEES. I

01:12:39.054 --> 01:12:40.989
WOULDN'T TAKE THE TAXES OUT OF

01:12:41.056 --> 01:12:42.357
THE EMPLOYEES CHECKS. BECAUSE

01:12:42.424 --> 01:12:44.426
WHEN I SET MY FOR MEN TO THE

01:12:44.493 --> 01:12:45.027
STATE THAT THEY VERIFY IN

01:12:45.094 --> 01:12:46.729
BALANCE. THEY WOULD SHOW THAT I

01:12:46.795 --> 01:12:48.864
JUST PAID MY PORTION AND NOT THE

01:12:48.931 --> 01:12:50.566

01:13:00.476 --> 01:13:01.677
CATASTROPHIC AND IT WOULD

01:13:01.744 --> 01:13:03.245
ELIMINATE ROAD CONSTRUCTION

01:13:03.312 --> 01:13:05.481

01:17:19.034 --> 01:17:22.070

WAS THAT IT ALREADY IS IN

01:17:53.902 --> 01:17:55.737

01:19:35.036 --> 01:19:36.238
IMPORTANT. AND SOLUTION TO

POVERTY IS A JOB. TOGETHER THESE

01:19:38.640 --> 01:19:40.208
FACTORS REDUCE THE LIKELIHOOD

01:19:40.275 --> 01:19:41.576
THAT FOSTER YOUTH WILL BECOME

BETTER CHANCE AT A SOLID START

01:19:57.025 --> 01:19:58.560
IN LIFE IT ALSO SUPPORTS THE

01:19:58.627 --> 01:20:00.428
BUSINESSES. THAT ARE WILLING TO

01:20:00.495 --> 01:20:03.265

FOSTER YOUTH- 40% CASH IT'S NOT

01:32:57.438 --> 01:33:00.841
40% ALMOST HALF. OF HOMELESS

01:33:00.908 --> 01:33:04.912
YOUTH IDENTIFY AS LGBT- IN

01:33:04.979 --> 01:33:08.716
ADDITION I ALSO BE T. TO YOU ARE

01:33:08.783 --> 01:33:12.753
HAVEL OVER A IN THE FALL CARE-

01:33:12.820 --> 01:33:16.490
SEEM ASK YOURSELF WHY IS A FIVE

01:33:16.557 --> 01:33:19.727
THAT HOME THAT YOUNG PEOPLE ARE

01:33:19.794 --> 01:33:23.497
SO INTENSELY OVER REPRESENTED

01:33:23.564 --> 01:33:26.267
AMONG HOMELESS USE AND YOUTH IN

01:33:26.334 --> 01:33:27.969
THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM GREEN

01:33:28.035 --> 01:33:30.404
LOOK AT USE OVERALL IN THE WORLD

01:33:30.471 --> 01:33:31.973
IT'S NOT THE CASE THAT FORTY

01:33:32.039 --> 01:33:35.543
PLUS PERCENT OF ALL YOUTH ARE.

01:33:35.609 --> 01:33:38.179
WITH MUCH SMALLER PERCENTAGE BUT

01:33:38.245 --> 01:33:40.181
ALMOST HALF OF HOMELESS YOUTH

01:33:40.247 --> 01:33:43.384
ARE LGBTQ AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT

01:33:43.451 --> 01:33:44.352
THE EXACT PERCENTAGES IN THE

01:33:44.418 --> 01:33:45.586
FOSTER CARE SYSTEM BUT I'S VERY

01:33:45.653 --> 01:33:49.023
HIGH WHY IS THAT THIS IS RANDOM

01:33:49.090 --> 01:33:50.591
NO IT'S NOT RANDOM IT'S BECAUSE

01:33:50.658 --> 01:33:51.993
OF THE WAY SOCIETY TREATS THESE

01:33:52.059 --> 01:33:54.662
CODES THREE TO MY GARBAGE LIKE

01:33:54.729 --> 01:33:57.031
GARBAGE PEOPLE THAT SOCIETY IS

01:33:57.098 --> 01:33:58.799
TRYING TO RAISE THEIR OFFER

01:33:58.866 --> 01:34:01.035
KICKED OUT OF THEIR HOMES THEIR

01:34:01.102 --> 01:34:03.938
THEIR TREATED HORRIBLE SCHOOL-

01:34:04.005 --> 01:34:06.640
THEY ARE TOLD FROM EARLY AGE BUT

01:34:06.707 --> 01:34:08.042
THEY DON'T MATTER THAT THEY HAVE

01:34:08.109 --> 01:34:11.612
NO WORTH- THAT THEY'RE FAKING IT

01:34:11.679 --> 01:34:12.246
WE SEE THAT WITH TRANS KIDS ARE

01:34:12.313 --> 01:34:14.248
PARTICULARLY TRYING TO SCAM YOUR

01:34:14.315 --> 01:34:17.151
WAY ON TO SPORTS TEAM OR- INTO A

01:34:17.218 --> 01:34:19.520
RESTROOM- THAT YOU'RE MAKING IT

01:34:19.587 --> 01:34:26.827
UP AND- MANIPULATING. AND SO IS

01:34:26.894 --> 01:34:28.529
IT ISN'T WONDER THE DISCO. STRAW

01:34:28.596 --> 01:34:30.765
WITH RATES OF SO HARM. BUT ALSO

01:34:30.831 --> 01:34:31.799
WITH HIGHER RATES OF HOMELESS.

01:34:31.866 --> 01:34:32.900
AND AN ENTRANCE THE FOSTER CARE.

01:34:32.967 --> 01:34:35.536
AND WITH TRAFFICKED. THIS IS A

01:34:35.603 --> 01:34:39.340
ROUGH TO A BILL- A- A VERY

01:34:39.407 --> 01:34:41.809
PROBLEMATIC TO. THAT THE SENATE

01:34:41.876 --> 01:34:42.843
PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE A FEW

01:34:42.910 --> 01:34:45.780
WEEKS AGO THE DOT PASSED. OUT OF

01:34:45.846 --> 01:34:47.648
COMMITTEE- AND SOME OF THE

01:34:47.715 --> 01:34:49.717
BACKERS OF THAT BILL. SOME OF

01:34:49.784 --> 01:34:52.987
WHOM. DO NOT HAVE STRONG RECORDS

01:34:53.054 --> 01:34:55.823
IN SUPPORTING LGBTQ. CIVIL

01:34:55.890 --> 01:35:00.628
RIGHTS- WORDS. REFERENCING LGBTQ

01:35:00.694 --> 01:35:03.030
KIDS BEING TRAFFICKED. BETTER

01:35:03.097 --> 01:35:08.936
SOMEONE LGBTQ ART BELL- AND I

01:35:09.003 --> 01:35:10.671
THOUGHT IT WAS IMPORTANT TO

01:35:10.738 --> 01:35:13.774
POINT OUT. THE WHY LGBTQ KIDS.

01:35:13.841 --> 01:35:14.975
OR SOMETIMES TRAFFICKED WHEN

01:35:15.042 --> 01:35:17.311
THEY'RE OUT ONE OUR STREETS AND

01:35:17.378 --> 01:35:20.948
HAVE NO WAY TO TRY TO EVEN

01:35:21.015 --> 01:35:22.817
SURVIVE AND ENGAGE IN SURVIVAL

01:35:22.883 --> 01:35:25.286
SEX WORK THAT THAT'S REAL

01:35:25.352 --> 01:35:28.489
BATTLES REAL IN OUR SOCIETY AND

01:35:28.556 --> 01:35:30.758
THAT IS BECAUSE OF THE WAY THERE

01:35:30.825 --> 01:35:33.828
TREATED BY OUR SOCIETY. AND YEAH

01:35:33.894 --> 01:35:35.763
ONE PEOPLE LIKE RHONDA SANDERSON

01:35:35.830 --> 01:35:37.898
GREAT JOB IT AND ALL THESE

01:35:37.965 --> 01:35:40.034
PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO LITERALLY

01:35:40.101 --> 01:35:42.303
SAY THAT YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO

01:35:42.369 --> 01:35:46.574
TALK ABOUT WHO YOU ARE IN SCHOOL

01:35:46.640 --> 01:35:48.843
BUT IT'S A LEGAL. T. EVEN TALK

01:35:48.909 --> 01:35:50.644
ABOUT WHO YOU ARE AS A HUMAN

01:35:50.711 --> 01:35:52.680
BEING IN SCHOOL OR THAT YOU'RE

01:35:52.746 --> 01:35:53.948
GONNA BE TAKEN AWAY FROM YOUR

01:35:54.014 --> 01:35:56.917
PARENTS AND YOUR PARENTS PUT IN

01:35:56.984 --> 01:35:57.985
JAIL. BECAUSE THEY SUPPORT

01:35:58.052 --> 01:35:59.787
HEALTH CARE FOR THE TRANS KID

01:35:59.854 --> 01:36:00.688
THAT'S NOT POLITICIZING

01:36:00.754 --> 01:36:04.458
ANYTHING. THAT'S EXPLAINING WHY

01:36:04.525 --> 01:36:06.527
SO MANY OF THESE KIDS ARE ON THE

01:36:06.594 --> 01:36:08.896
STREET WHY SO MANY OF THESE KIDS

01:36:08.963 --> 01:36:11.031
ARE IN FOSTER CARE. WHY SO MANY

01:36:11.098 --> 01:36:13.234
OF THESE KIDS QUESTION THEIR OWN

01:36:13.300 --> 01:36:15.569
WORTH AND ENGAGE IN SELF HARM

01:36:15.636 --> 01:36:17.605
THAT'S NOT POLITICS. THAT IS

01:36:17.671 --> 01:36:18.772
POLITICS AND POLITICS BY CERTAIN

01:36:18.839 --> 01:36:22.610
POLITICIANS WHO WERE TRYING TO.

01:36:22.676 --> 01:36:24.078
THAT WHEREVER THEY'RE TRYING TO

01:36:24.145 --> 01:36:26.881
GO ON THE BACKS OF CHILDREN. AND

01:36:26.947 --> 01:36:28.949
THAT EXPLAINS WHY THESE CHILDREN

01:36:29.016 --> 01:36:32.153
SUFFER SO MUCH- AND SO I JUST

01:36:32.219 --> 01:36:34.221
WANT TO EXPRESS AND I'M GLAD

01:36:34.288 --> 01:36:35.456
THAT YOU'RE PUSHING FOR THIS

01:36:35.523 --> 01:36:36.957
BILL THIS IS A GOOD BILL AND I

01:36:37.024 --> 01:36:39.693
SUPPORT A HUNDRED PERCENT- AND

01:36:39.760 --> 01:36:41.662

GET OFFICE. EXISTS ACCESS FULLY

01:36:44.431 --> 01:36:46.467
OUT OF FOSTER CARE GET THEM JOBS

01:36:46.534 --> 01:36:48.135

YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL BUT I

01:36:50.171 --> 01:36:52.173

01:36:52.239 --> 01:36:53.841
SERVE EXPLAINED- THESE OTHER

01:36:53.908 --> 01:36:57.278

YOU FOR INTRODUCING THIS BELT-

01:37:04.852 --> 01:37:06.687
THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT- YOU

01:37:06.754 --> 01:37:08.956
KNOW WE TAKE WE TAKE THE ISSUES.

01:37:09.023 --> 01:37:10.958
IN PIECES AND TRY TO SOLVE THEM

01:37:11.025 --> 01:37:13.761
OUT LITTLE BY LITTLE AND- MANY

01:37:13.827 --> 01:37:14.929
TIMES THERE THERE'S A MUCH

01:37:14.995 --> 01:37:17.264
BROADER ISSUE THAT- BECOMES

01:37:17.331 --> 01:37:19.233
DIFFICULT TO GET OUR ARMS AROUND

01:37:19.300 --> 01:37:20.834
AND THE WHOLE ISSUE OF FOSTER

01:37:20.901 --> 01:37:23.070
CARE HAS- HAS LONG BEEN A

01:37:23.137 --> 01:37:24.905
CHALLENGE BECAUSE WE WANT TO

01:37:24.972 --> 01:37:26.674
PROTECT KIDS BUT SOMETIMES WHEN

01:37:26.740 --> 01:37:27.808
THEY GET INTO THE FOSTER CARE

01:37:27.875 --> 01:37:30.477
SYSTEM THEY JUST DON'T GET THE

01:37:30.544 --> 01:37:31.045
HELP THEY NEED- AND I KNOW

01:37:31.111 --> 01:37:33.047
BECAUSE I'VE- I'VE DONE A LOT OF

01:37:33.113 --> 01:37:34.081
WORK- IN. IN THAT SYSTEM AND

01:37:34.148 --> 01:37:36.984
IT'S FRUSTRATING- HOW LITTLE

01:37:37.051 --> 01:37:38.786
SUPPORT FOSTER KIDS GET IN THE

01:37:38.852 --> 01:37:41.555
END OF DAY MAY BE SAFE FOR IT

01:37:41.622 --> 01:37:43.824
FOR SOME OF THEM DURING THE

01:37:43.891 --> 01:37:45.392
EIGHTEEN YEARS THAT THEY'RE THAT

01:37:45.459 --> 01:37:47.361
THERE ARE CONSIDERED MINERS BUT%

01:37:47.428 --> 01:37:49.129
THEN AFTER THAT IT'S VERY

01:37:49.196 --> 01:37:50.998
DIFFICULT FOR THEM- BECAUSE THEY

01:37:51.065 --> 01:37:52.700
DON'T HAVE ANY FAMILY SUPPORT IN

01:37:52.766 --> 01:37:54.368
AS WE KNOW FAMILY SUPPORT IS. IS

01:37:54.435 --> 01:37:55.769
EVERYTHING IN OUR IN OUR

01:37:55.836 --> 01:37:56.937
COMMUNITY SO WE GOT TO CREATE

COMMITTEE THAT'S FOR QUESTIONS

02:00:24.383 --> 02:00:27.720
COMMENTS CONCERNS CENTER NIELSEN

02:00:27.787 --> 02:00:31.023
. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. I HAVE

02:00:31.090 --> 02:00:33.559
TO CONFESS SOME FRUSTRATION WITH

02:00:33.626 --> 02:00:37.430
THE SOLAR INDUSTRY. AS HAS BEEN

02:00:37.496 --> 02:00:39.665
TESTIFIED HERE IT'S BEEN AROUND

02:00:39.732 --> 02:00:44.103
QUITE A WHILE. IT IS MATURING.

02:00:44.170 --> 02:00:46.572
IT HAS ITS PLACE IN OUR ENERGY

02:00:46.639 --> 02:00:49.208
MIX. THE TOO MUCH HAS BEEN MADE

02:00:49.275 --> 02:00:50.876
OF HOW WE CAN BE TO BENDED ON A

02:00:50.943 --> 02:00:53.012
ONLY AND ENERGY. AND SOLAR

02:00:53.079 --> 02:00:56.949
ENERGY IT HAS ITS PLACE. BUT IF

02:00:57.016 --> 02:00:59.719
THAT'S WHERE WE PUT ALL THE EGGS

02:00:59.785 --> 02:01:01.120
IN OUR ENERGY BASKET. OUR

02:01:01.187 --> 02:01:02.822
CHILDREN THE GENERATIONS WILL

02:01:02.888 --> 02:01:06.492
SUFFER GREATLY. THEY AGAIN HAVE

02:01:06.559 --> 02:01:09.562
THEIR PLACE BUT MY FRUSTRATION

02:01:09.629 --> 02:01:11.864
IS A SOLAR INDUSTRY SEEMS TO BE

02:01:11.931 --> 02:01:14.634
QUITE GREEDY. EVERY YEAR SEEKING

02:01:14.700 --> 02:01:18.004
NEW ADVANTAGES FOR THEM. TO

02:01:18.070 --> 02:01:22.441
SUSTAIN ITSELF. DOWN ON THE FARM

02:01:22.508 --> 02:01:24.577
WE CALL IT WINNING THE CALF.

02:01:24.644 --> 02:01:26.679
MAYBE IT'S TIME FOR A LITTLE

02:01:26.746 --> 02:01:28.648
WINNING OF THE SOLAR INDUSTRY.

02:01:28.714 --> 02:01:30.650
AND AS TESTIFIED HERE AND I'M

02:01:30.716 --> 02:01:32.218
DELIGHTED TO SEE THE COUNTIES

02:01:32.284 --> 02:01:35.655
COMING FORTH EXPRESSING CONCERNS

02:01:35.721 --> 02:01:37.256
. NOT VIGOROUS OPPOSITION BUT

02:01:37.323 --> 02:01:39.592
CONCERNS. AND THAT'S WHAT I'M

02:01:39.659 --> 02:01:41.827
VOICE. I DON'T SEE THE SOLAR

02:01:41.894 --> 02:01:44.363
INDUSTRY HELPING AND SUPPORTING

02:01:44.430 --> 02:01:46.499
OR EVEN TALKING ABOUT IT BEING

02:01:46.565 --> 02:01:48.934
AWARE OF COGENERATION. WHICH

02:01:49.001 --> 02:01:50.503
WOULD HELP US CLEAN UP THE FORCE

02:01:50.569 --> 02:01:52.138
IN THE WILDLANDS AND CUT DOWN

02:01:52.204 --> 02:01:56.742
THESE ENORMOUS CATACLYSMIC FIRES

02:01:56.809 --> 02:01:58.944
. SO MY POINT IS A CHALLENGE TO

02:01:59.011 --> 02:02:00.579
THE SOLAR INDUSTRY. THE QUIT

02:02:00.646 --> 02:02:03.783
BEING SO SELFISH. AND THINK

02:02:03.849 --> 02:02:05.851
ABOUT THE WHOLE ENERGY BASKET

02:02:05.918 --> 02:02:08.320
FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND

02:02:08.387 --> 02:02:10.289
SUPPORTING OTHER ENERGY

02:02:10.356 --> 02:02:13.125
PRODUCING ENTITIES AND HELPING

02:02:13.192 --> 02:02:14.460
THE COUNTIES AS THEY HAVE

02:02:14.527 --> 02:02:16.362
EXPRESSED HERE THEIR OWN

02:02:16.429 --> 02:02:19.231
CONCERNS THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR.

02:02:19.298 --> 02:02:21.267
THANK YOU ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR

02:02:21.333 --> 02:02:25.204
CONCERNS MOTION. CENTER HURT FOR

02:02:25.271 --> 02:02:28.140
YOU CAN MAKE THE MOTION YEAH.

02:02:28.207 --> 02:02:31.777
THE SENATOR RAZA MAKES MOTION I

02:02:31.844 --> 02:02:33.979
DO HAVE A I DO HAVE A COMMENT

02:02:34.046 --> 02:02:35.181
AND I DO APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS

02:02:35.247 --> 02:02:38.050
FROM THE- FROM THE COUNTY- TWO

02:02:38.117 --> 02:02:39.952
THINGS ONE IS THAT YOU KNOW IS

02:02:40.019 --> 02:02:42.555
CALIFORNIA REALLY HAS INVESTED

02:02:42.621 --> 02:02:45.691
A- LOT OF. TIME ENERGY AND MONEY

02:02:45.758 --> 02:02:48.594
ON THE SOLAR INDUSTRY. AND IT'S

02:02:48.661 --> 02:02:51.864
FRUSTRATING TO ME THAT WE STILL-

02:02:51.931 --> 02:02:53.833
THAT WE ARE STILL BUYING OUR

02:02:53.899 --> 02:02:55.334
SOLAR PANELS FROM OTHER

02:02:55.401 --> 02:02:56.969
COUNTRIES WE DON'T EVEN PRODUCE

02:02:57.036 --> 02:02:58.771
THEM HERE IN IN OUR COUNTRY AND

02:02:58.838 --> 02:03:00.840
SO FOR CALIFORNIA TO BE AT THE

02:03:00.906 --> 02:03:02.675
FOREFRONT AND SAY WE REALLY WANT

02:03:02.742 --> 02:03:05.244
TO GO GREEN AND YET WE DON'T DO

02:03:05.311 --> 02:03:06.078
IT OURSELVES IT'S FRUSTRATING

02:03:06.145 --> 02:03:06.912
BECAUSE THAT THOSE ARE JOBS SO

02:03:06.979 --> 02:03:08.214
THAT'S NUMBER ONE. THERE THERE

02:03:08.280 --> 02:03:10.282
ARE A COUPLE OF NEW SMALLER

02:03:10.349 --> 02:03:12.618
COMPANIES THAT ARE STARTING UP-

02:03:12.685 --> 02:03:14.854
BUT WE NEED TO. WE NEED TO MAKE

02:03:14.920 --> 02:03:16.589
SURE THAT THE THEIR SUCCESSFUL

02:03:16.655 --> 02:03:18.157
BECAUSE THAT'S OUR WORKFORCE. SO

02:03:18.224 --> 02:03:19.024
THAT'S NUMBER ONE NUMBER TWO IS

02:03:19.091 --> 02:03:23.362
THAT- WE HAVE INCENTIVIZE. GREEN

02:03:23.429 --> 02:03:26.732
TECHNOLOGY. IN THEM WHICH IS

02:03:26.799 --> 02:03:28.000
REALLY IMPORTANT IT'S BEEN GREAT

02:03:28.067 --> 02:03:30.903
BUT- BY THE- COMMUNITIES THAT

02:03:30.970 --> 02:03:33.439
HAVE HAD THEWHERE WITH ALL TO.

02:03:33.506 --> 02:03:35.808
SET UP THE CCA'S. I ALWAYS

02:03:35.875 --> 02:03:37.476
FORGET WHAT THE ACRONYM STANDS

02:03:37.543 --> 02:03:39.145
FOR BUT THE CHOICE EXIT HE

02:03:39.211 --> 02:03:40.346
COMMUNITY CHOICEAGGREGATE

02:03:40.412 --> 02:03:42.014
THAT'S WHY I CAN NEVER REMEMBER

02:03:42.081 --> 02:03:43.549
BECAUSE WHAT DOES THAT MEAN TWO

02:03:43.616 --> 02:03:45.718
THOUSAND YEAH AND- AND THAT.

02:03:45.785 --> 02:03:48.921
THOSE ARE FOR THE MOST PART THE

02:03:48.988 --> 02:03:50.689
COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE INVESTED

02:03:50.756 --> 02:03:56.362
IN THOSE ALTERNATIVE. ENERGY CAN

02:03:56.428 --> 02:03:59.431
CONGLOMERATES ARE ON THE COAST

02:03:59.498 --> 02:04:01.200
AND THEIR WEALTHIER COMMUNITIES

02:04:01.267 --> 02:04:06.272
AND THEY HAVE LESS NEED. WE HAVE

02:04:06.338 --> 02:04:07.773
THE SAID THEY SAID THEY HAVE A

02:04:07.840 --> 02:04:09.642
NEED FOR ENERGY BUT THEY HAVE

02:04:09.708 --> 02:04:10.810
LESS OF A NEED BECAUSE THEY'RE

02:04:10.876 --> 02:04:12.444
NOT AS HOT AS THE INTERIOR OF

02:04:12.511 --> 02:04:13.879
THE STATE AND THEY'RE NOT AS

02:04:13.946 --> 02:04:16.048
COLD AS THE INTERIOR OF THE

02:04:16.115 --> 02:04:16.916
STATE AND MY POINT I'M MAKING

02:04:16.982 --> 02:04:19.151
WITH ALL OF THIS IS THAT- WHAT

02:04:19.218 --> 02:04:21.954
THEY WANT TO DO. IS BUILD SOLAR

02:04:22.021 --> 02:04:23.455
IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND

02:04:23.522 --> 02:04:24.924
TRANSPORT THAT ENERGY TO THE

02:04:24.990 --> 02:04:27.560
COAST AND WHILE THAT'S A GOOD

02:04:27.626 --> 02:04:29.195
THING- I THINK THE CENTRAL

02:04:29.261 --> 02:04:31.964
VALLEY I DON'T BENEFIT FROM THAT

02:04:32.031 --> 02:04:33.966
DEVELOPMENT. AND SO I'VE BEEN

02:04:34.033 --> 02:04:38.737
ENCOURAGING THE CCA'S. TWO IF

02:04:38.804 --> 02:04:40.806
THEY'RE GONNA BILL SOLAR PANELS-

02:04:40.873 --> 02:04:42.274
THAT THEY DO IT. AROUND

02:04:42.341 --> 02:04:43.542
COMMUNITIES IT REALLY NEED THE

02:04:43.609 --> 02:04:46.111
ENERGY- WHAT- AND I DO HAVE TO

02:04:46.178 --> 02:04:49.315
COMMEND THAT. SAN MATTEO CCA FOR

02:04:49.381 --> 02:04:51.116
BUILDING SOLAR AROUND UNLESS

02:04:51.183 --> 02:04:52.151
FINANCING THEY'RE GOING TO

02:04:52.218 --> 02:04:53.953
INCLUDE THE CITY OF LOS FINE YES

02:04:54.019 --> 02:04:55.421
AND THEY'VE ALSO AGREED. THAT

02:04:55.487 --> 02:04:56.422
THEY WOULD EXTEND THE SAME

02:04:56.488 --> 02:04:57.857
OPPORTUNITY FOR COMMUNITIES

02:04:57.923 --> 02:05:00.092
MENDOTA FIREBAUGH. SAN JOAQUIN

02:05:00.159 --> 02:05:02.061
THE REASON THAT'S IMPORTANT. AND

02:05:02.127 --> 02:05:03.963
IN THIS GETS BACK TO OUR OUR

02:05:04.029 --> 02:05:07.066
THAT OUR- ENERGY POLICY GOALS AS

02:05:07.132 --> 02:05:10.569
WELL AS OUR- CLIMATE CHANGE

02:05:10.636 --> 02:05:14.773
GOALS IS THAT THAT AREA. WILL

02:05:14.840 --> 02:05:17.676
LOSE BETWEEN FIVE HUNDRED

02:05:17.743 --> 02:05:19.178
THOUSAND TO A MILLION ACRES OF

02:05:19.245 --> 02:05:22.014
AG LAND PRODUCTION ONCE SIGMA

02:05:22.081 --> 02:05:24.283
CLIQUE KICKS IN SO WE HAVE THESE

02:05:24.350 --> 02:05:25.551
SEPARATE SYSTEMS RIGHT WE HAVE

02:05:25.618 --> 02:05:27.453
THE WATER SYSTEM IS SEPARATE

02:05:27.519 --> 02:05:29.054
THEN ENERGY THAT SEPARATE THEN

02:05:29.121 --> 02:05:31.924
THEN- LAND USE BUT BUT WHEN YOU

02:05:31.991 --> 02:05:32.958
PUT IT ALL TOGETHER THE

02:05:33.025 --> 02:05:33.993
COMMUNITIES ARE REALLY GONNA

02:05:34.059 --> 02:05:35.527
SUFFER IN THE COMMUNITIES THAT

02:05:35.594 --> 02:05:37.096
THEY DON'T HAVE ANY RESOURCES

02:05:37.162 --> 02:05:39.231
THAT HAVE A LOT OF. OF PEOPLE

02:05:39.298 --> 02:05:42.735
THAT ARE- HARD WORKING

02:05:42.801 --> 02:05:45.704
CALIFORNIANS AND THAT- RELY ON

02:05:45.771 --> 02:05:47.206
AGRICULTURE THAT ARE NOT GOING

02:05:47.273 --> 02:05:49.241
TO HAVE A LIVELIHOOD AND THAT

02:05:49.308 --> 02:05:49.942
THEY'RE NOT GONNA HAVE ENERGY IN

02:05:50.009 --> 02:05:51.944
THERE AND SO WEAK MY POINT ABOUT

02:05:52.011 --> 02:05:55.447
ALL OF THIS IS THAT- WE NEED TO

02:05:55.514 --> 02:05:57.216
SHARE. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:05:57.283 --> 02:05:58.751
HAVE SOLAR PANELS ARE GOING INTO

02:05:58.817 --> 02:05:59.885
COUNTY THAT THEY SHARE IN THE

02:05:59.952 --> 02:06:01.921
BENEFIT OF THE SOLAR PANELS AS

02:06:01.987 --> 02:06:03.756
WELL AS WE CAN FIGURE OUT HOW TO

02:06:03.822 --> 02:06:05.124
DO THAT. I'M GONNA SUPPORT THE

02:06:05.190 --> 02:06:06.725
BILL TODAY I HEAR THAT THAT-

02:06:06.792 --> 02:06:07.893
THERE'S SOME MORE WORK TO BE

02:06:07.960 --> 02:06:10.262
DONE AND I WILL I WILL I AM.

02:06:10.329 --> 02:06:12.631
ASSUMING THAT YOU WILL APPLY TO

02:06:12.698 --> 02:06:13.299
THE COURT WILL GET THERE AND SO

02:06:13.365 --> 02:06:15.367
UP WITH THAT YOU MAKE INCLUDE.

02:06:15.434 --> 02:06:19.405
THEM THE MAGIC THAT'S TWO

02:06:19.471 --> 02:06:20.472
HUNDRED SIXTY THOUSAND SQUARE

02:06:20.539 --> 02:06:21.140
MILES SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND SQUARE

02:06:21.206 --> 02:06:23.242
MILES OF CALIFORNIA. INFORMED BY

02:06:23.309 --> 02:06:24.843
FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES. EACH OF US

02:06:24.910 --> 02:06:27.012
HAVE RESPECTED BURDENS. EACH OF

02:06:27.079 --> 02:06:28.514
US CONTRIBUTE IN DIFFERENT WAYS

02:06:28.580 --> 02:06:30.549
TO WHAT IS CALIFORNIA. THE

02:06:30.616 --> 02:06:32.151
PEOPLE THAT LIVE IN THE HARBOR.

02:06:32.217 --> 02:06:33.786
THOSE TRACTORS WOULD COME TO.

02:06:33.852 --> 02:06:35.421
PLOW THOSE FIELDS COME FROM A

02:06:35.487 --> 02:06:37.122
LOT OF THOSE SHIPS. THAT THOSE

02:06:37.189 --> 02:06:39.358
KIDS ARE. SUCKING UP THAT THE

02:06:39.425 --> 02:06:40.392
ASTHMA AND THE PROBLEMS THEY

02:06:40.459 --> 02:06:41.860
FACE BECAUSE THE TRACTORS. HOW

02:06:41.927 --> 02:06:44.063
MANY PEOPLE FROM EACH OF THE

02:06:44.129 --> 02:06:45.464
COUNTIES GO TO. SANDALS

02:06:45.531 --> 02:06:46.031
INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT. AND

02:06:46.098 --> 02:06:47.466
UTILIZE THAT FACILITY. WHAT

02:06:47.533 --> 02:06:49.468
COUNTIES ARE ENGAGED IN SELF

02:06:49.535 --> 02:06:51.537
HELP AND WHICH COUNTIES ARC. THE

02:06:51.603 --> 02:06:53.439
QUESTION IS WE IS A STATE. IN

02:06:53.505 --> 02:06:54.873
THE BIG PICTURE POLICY THIS

02:06:54.940 --> 02:06:56.608
INFORMED BY THE QUESTIONS HERE

02:06:56.675 --> 02:06:59.745
IN THE- OPPOSITION HERE. HAVE AN

02:06:59.812 --> 02:07:01.280
OBLIGATION. WE SIT BACK IN A RIP

02:07:01.347 --> 02:07:03.115
IN A AND R. AGENCIES TELL US

02:07:03.182 --> 02:07:05.017

SEVENTY GIGAWATTS SEVENTY

02:07:06.251 --> 02:07:06.719
GIGAWATTS SEVEN THOUSAND

02:07:06.785 --> 02:07:08.587
MEGAWATTS OF SOLAR POWER. TO

02:07:08.654 --> 02:07:10.656
MEET THE TWENTY FORTY FIVE SO

02:07:10.723 --> 02:07:11.090
WE'RE CREATING THIS

02:07:11.156 --> 02:07:12.992
EXTRAORDINARY TRANSITION. THAT'S

02:07:13.058 --> 02:07:14.960
HAPPENING AT A TIME WHERE

02:07:15.027 --> 02:07:15.527
TECHNOLOGY IS FUNDAMENTALLY

02:07:15.594 --> 02:07:16.895
CHANGE I'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR

02:07:16.962 --> 02:07:18.364
THIRTY FIVE YEARS I'VE WATCHED

02:07:18.430 --> 02:07:20.165
TECHNOLOGY CHANGED DRAMATICALLY.

02:07:20.232 --> 02:07:22.434
AND YOU KNOW I TRY TO BUILD THE

02:07:22.501 --> 02:07:24.203
SOLAR FACTORY IN LOS ANGELES IT

02:07:24.269 --> 02:07:25.137
DIDN'T WORK. THE BILL FOR

02:07:25.204 --> 02:07:26.572
OFFICERS THAT WE SHOULD PUT

02:07:26.638 --> 02:07:28.107
EVERY ONE OF THOSE JOBS SHOULD

02:07:28.173 --> 02:07:30.075
BE HERE. AND PART OF WHAT WE'RE

02:07:30.142 --> 02:07:31.176
TRYING TO DO HERE IN LOOKING AT

02:07:31.243 --> 02:07:33.012
THE ECONOMICS IS TO MAKE SURE

02:07:33.078 --> 02:07:34.747
THAT THE JOBS WITH RESPECT TO

02:07:34.813 --> 02:07:35.914
UTILITY GRADE SOLAR DON'T GO TO

02:07:35.981 --> 02:07:37.816
THE STATE. BECAUSE IT'S ABOUT

02:07:37.883 --> 02:07:39.184
MONEY WE WANT THOSE JOBS HERE WE

02:07:39.251 --> 02:07:40.552
WANT THAT THOSE FACILITIES TO BE

02:07:40.619 --> 02:07:42.921
BUILT HERE WE DON'T WANT THEM IN

02:07:42.988 --> 02:07:43.989
A NEIGHBORING STATE THAT ALSO

02:07:44.056 --> 02:07:46.291
HAVE SON. THAT MUCH MORE TO BE

02:07:46.358 --> 02:07:47.826
JUST POLICY. EXES SO YES IT'S

02:07:47.893 --> 02:07:49.762
MATURED DRAMATICALLY YES THE

02:07:49.828 --> 02:07:51.330
TECHNOLOGY HAS CHANGED JUST THE

02:07:51.397 --> 02:07:53.332
PRICING HAS GONE DOWN BUT IF YOU

02:07:53.399 --> 02:07:54.867
LOOK AT WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO

02:07:54.933 --> 02:07:57.836
AS A AS AS A STATE. TO MOVE AWAY

02:07:57.903 --> 02:07:59.405
FROM FOSSIL FUELS WE HAVE TO

02:07:59.471 --> 02:08:00.773
FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET THERE AND

02:08:00.839 --> 02:08:02.641
THIS IS A NECESSARY COMPONENT.

02:08:02.708 --> 02:08:04.910
AND I'VE HAD SOME VERY IMPORTANT

02:08:04.977 --> 02:08:06.378
INTERESTING CONVERSATIONS WITH

02:08:06.445 --> 02:08:07.446
ELECTED OFFICIALS FROM KERN

02:08:07.513 --> 02:08:09.448
COUNTY AND I UNDERSTAND THEIR-

02:08:09.515 --> 02:08:11.517
THEIR POINT OF VIEW I GET IT.

02:08:11.583 --> 02:08:15.020
BUT IF YOU LOOK AT WHEN YOU TALK

02:08:15.087 --> 02:08:16.121
IT LANDED ABUSE OTHERWISE WHAT'S

02:08:16.188 --> 02:08:18.123
THOSE OTHER REVENUE STREAMS- IS

02:08:18.190 --> 02:08:20.092
REVENUE FROM THIS. WHAT WE'RE

02:08:20.159 --> 02:08:22.294
TRYING TO DO IS TO FIGURE OUT.

02:08:22.361 --> 02:08:23.662
WE CAN BALANCE. AS THINGS CHANGE

02:08:23.729 --> 02:08:25.931
I THINK A LOT OF THIS WHAT'S

02:08:25.998 --> 02:08:26.832
GOING TO HAPPEN MY OWN PERSONAL

02:08:26.899 --> 02:08:28.367
VIEW IS WE'RE GOING TO BE GREEN

02:08:28.434 --> 02:08:29.234
HYDROGEN WHICH IS BASICALLY

02:08:29.301 --> 02:08:30.903
SOLAR CELLS AND WATER. MAKING

02:08:30.969 --> 02:08:31.804
HYDROGEN WHICH IS GONNA BE

02:08:31.870 --> 02:08:33.172
EXPORTABLE YOU CAN PUT IN PIPES

02:08:33.238 --> 02:08:34.940
YOU CAN DO ALL SORTS OF THINGS.

02:08:35.007 --> 02:08:36.942
I THINK WE'RE IN THIS DEVELOPING

02:08:37.009 --> 02:08:38.277
STAGES OF WHAT'S GOING ON WE

02:08:38.343 --> 02:08:40.079
MADE THE SUN SETS BECAUSE WE

02:08:40.145 --> 02:08:41.513
MADE ANTICIPATIONS WE DIDN'T

02:08:41.580 --> 02:08:42.915
KNOW WHERE WE WOULD BE. BUT THE

02:08:42.981 --> 02:08:44.183
BOTTOM LINE- JUST FINISHED

02:08:44.249 --> 02:08:45.784
CAMANCHE HERE IS THAT WE'RE NOT

02:08:45.851 --> 02:08:48.020
THERE YET THAT WE HAVE TO SEND

02:08:48.087 --> 02:08:49.822
MARKET SIGNALS THE COMPANIES TO

02:08:49.888 --> 02:08:55.027
INVEST. AND MAKE THAT HAPPEN.

02:08:55.094 --> 02:08:57.062
AND SO. I WOULD JUST SUGGEST TO

02:08:57.129 --> 02:08:58.997
YOU. THAT THIS IS A THOUGHT AND

02:08:59.064 --> 02:09:00.499
INTO. APPROACH THAT IS NOT BEING

02:09:00.566 --> 02:09:01.100
PACKAGE. IN TERMS OF WHAT'S

02:09:01.166 --> 02:09:03.535
GOING ON WITH RESPECT TO MARKET

02:09:03.602 --> 02:09:04.670
SIGNALS. AND WHERE WE ARE I

02:09:04.736 --> 02:09:06.205
DON'T THINK THIS WILL BE

02:09:06.271 --> 02:09:07.139
FOREVER. BUT I DO THINK THAT

02:09:07.206 --> 02:09:08.941
THIS IS NECESSARY FOR US. TO

02:09:09.007 --> 02:09:10.943
ACTUALLY HARMONIZE AND MEET THE

02:09:11.009 --> 02:09:12.911
GOALS AND EVERYBODY TO CARE THE

02:09:12.978 --> 02:09:14.146
WRIST CARRY THE RESPECTIVE

02:09:14.213 --> 02:09:16.548
BURDENS. OF WHAT'S NECESSARY YOU

02:09:16.615 --> 02:09:17.850
KNOW ALL THE GOODS MOVING THE

02:09:17.916 --> 02:09:20.486
COMES OUT OF LA AND ALL OF THOSE

02:09:20.552 --> 02:09:22.054
THINGS INFORM ALL OF US. SO WITH

02:09:22.121 --> 02:09:23.155
THAT. I THINK IS AN IMPORTANT

02:09:23.222 --> 02:09:24.089
MEASURE I THINK THE COMMITTEE

02:09:24.156 --> 02:09:26.758
STAFFERS MADE SOME IMPORTANT

02:09:26.825 --> 02:09:27.893

OF THE STATE. THAT THEIR

CONFERENCE LAST DECEMBER IN A

02:11:27.813 --> 02:11:29.114
LAND OF THE NATIONAL CONFERENCE

02:11:29.181 --> 02:11:31.984
WOULD BLOCK STATE LEGISLATORS.

02:11:32.050 --> 02:11:34.186
AND THIS IS A CRISIS ALL OVER

02:11:34.253 --> 02:11:36.288
UNITED STATES SPECIALLY WHEN IT

02:11:36.355 --> 02:11:40.359
COMES TO EQUITY OPERATORS. AND

02:11:40.425 --> 02:11:41.426
THEY'RE HOPING THAT THEY CAN

02:11:41.493 --> 02:11:43.161
SURVIVE. THE INDUSTRY REPORTED

02:11:43.228 --> 02:11:44.930
THAT THE OPPORTUNITY TO CREATE A

02:11:44.997 --> 02:11:47.232
ROBUST LEGAL CANNABIS MARKET IS

02:11:47.299 --> 02:11:49.134
BEING SQUANDERED BECAUSE OF.

02:11:49.201 --> 02:11:51.270
EXCESSIVE TAXATION AND

02:11:51.336 --> 02:11:51.970
OVERREGULATION FOR OUR

PRODUCTS ARE AT LEAST 50% MORE

02:11:56.642 --> 02:12:00.412
EXPENSIVE. THAN ON THE ILLICIT-

02:12:00.479 --> 02:12:02.214
UNDERGROUND MARKET CALIFORNIA

02:12:02.281 --> 02:12:04.750
TAX POLICIES RESULTING IN AN

02:12:04.816 --> 02:12:06.852
ENVIRONMENT FOR THE ILLICIT

02:12:06.918 --> 02:12:09.121
MARKET TO EXPAND. AND MAKING IT

02:12:09.187 --> 02:12:10.956
ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE FOR LEGITIMATE

02:12:11.023 --> 02:12:12.691
BUSINESSES TO COMPETE WITHOUT

02:12:12.758 --> 02:12:14.526
SOME KIND OF REAL MEANINGFUL

02:12:14.593 --> 02:12:17.262
SUBSTANTIVE CHANGE I AM AFRAID

02:12:17.329 --> 02:12:18.463
THAT THIS INDUSTRY IS DESTINED

02:12:18.530 --> 02:12:21.033
TO FAIL SB TWELVE EIGHTY ONE

02:12:21.099 --> 02:12:22.601
WOULD ELIMINATE CANNABIS

02:12:22.668 --> 02:12:23.702
CULTIVATION TAX REDUCED EXCISE

02:12:23.769 --> 02:12:27.372
TAX. FROM 15% 25% AND MOVE THE

02:12:27.439 --> 02:12:28.807
POINT OF COLLECTION OF THE

EXCISE SAYS FROM THE DISTRIBUTOR%

02:12:30.909 --> 02:12:32.344
THE RETAILER. WILL TO

CULTIVATION EXCISE TAX ARE

02:12:33.779 --> 02:12:35.614
CURRENTLY COLLECTED AT THE POINT

02:12:35.681 --> 02:12:37.349
OF ISTRIBUTION OFTEN REQUIRING

02:12:37.416 --> 02:12:39.651
CANNABIS RETAILERS TO PAY ACCESS

02:12:39.718 --> 02:12:42.954
TAX BEFORE EVER- MAKING A SELL

02:12:43.021 --> 02:12:44.923
ON CANNABIS SO IN ESSENCE YOU'RE

02:12:44.990 --> 02:12:46.892
PAYING FOR INVENTORY I MEAN

02:12:46.958 --> 02:12:47.859
OPINION ATTACKS ON INVENTORY

02:12:47.926 --> 02:12:49.594
THAT YOU MIGHT NOT NEVER STILL

02:12:49.661 --> 02:12:51.396
AND AS WE ALL KNOW ALL OF. THESE

02:12:51.463 --> 02:12:53.432
PRODUCTS HAVE EXPIRATION DATE

02:12:53.498 --> 02:12:56.401
AND I'VE VISITED- RETAILERS AS

02:12:56.468 --> 02:12:57.502
WELL AS DISTRIBUTION CENTERS

02:12:57.569 --> 02:13:02.708
WHERE. THEY HAVE TO GO OUT IN-

02:13:02.774 --> 02:13:05.310
DISPOSE OF- WHY A BIT OF THIS

02:13:05.377 --> 02:13:07.546
PRODUCT ON A REGULAR BASIS AND

02:13:07.612 --> 02:13:08.947
THEY ALSO JUST CAN'T PUT IT IN

02:13:09.014 --> 02:13:11.450
THE TRASH CAN YOU HAVE TO HAVE A

02:13:11.516 --> 02:13:13.618
SPECIAL- RECYCLER ARE COLLECTOR

02:13:13.685 --> 02:13:15.120
TO COME IN AND- HANDLES

02:13:15.187 --> 02:13:17.055
SITUATION. WHICH IS ADDITIONAL

02:13:17.122 --> 02:13:19.057
COST AND BURDEN TO THE BUSINESS.

02:13:19.124 --> 02:13:20.559
AND WHILE THE ELIMINATION OF THE

02:13:20.625 --> 02:13:22.027
CULTIVATION TAX AND A REDUCTION

02:13:22.094 --> 02:13:24.229
OF EXCISE TAX MAY DECREASE TAX

02:13:24.296 --> 02:13:25.997
REVENUE FOR PROGRAMS THAT ARE

02:13:26.064 --> 02:13:27.599
DEPENDENT UPON THE REVENUE. IT

02:13:27.666 --> 02:13:29.267
IS ANTICIPATED THAT YOU WILL

02:13:29.334 --> 02:13:30.602
HAVE GREATER DEMAND FROM THE

02:13:30.669 --> 02:13:33.805
LEGAL OPPORT OPERATORS WILL TOOL

02:13:33.872 --> 02:13:36.007
MORE THAN MAKE UP FOR THE

02:13:36.074 --> 02:13:38.477
DIFFERENCE AND- FROM GOING FROM

02:13:38.543 --> 02:13:39.845
15220% BECAUSE I THINK WE'RE

02:13:39.911 --> 02:13:43.548
GOING TO DRIVE MORE- BUSINESSES

02:13:43.615 --> 02:13:44.549

02:13:45.851 --> 02:13:47.052
MARKET CAN SYMBOLIZE INCREASE

02:13:47.119 --> 02:13:49.287
CELLS. ARE REALIZE WERE PRESENT

02:13:49.354 --> 02:13:51.423
PURSUING A GENERAL FUND REVENUE.

02:13:51.490 --> 02:13:53.558
TO OFFSET ANY REDUCTION IN THE

02:13:53.625 --> 02:13:55.060
CANNABIS TAX FUND TO ENSURE THE

02:13:55.127 --> 02:13:56.361
PROGRAMS THAT ARE DEPENDENT ON

THAT WILL. CONTINUE TO BE FUNDED

02:13:58.063 --> 02:14:00.265
SO I ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT AND

02:14:00.332 --> 02:14:02.134

BUYING ILLEGAL CANNABIS IS A

02:18:01.239 --> 02:18:03.208
CRITICAL PART OF THIS ANALYSIS.

AS A TOOL. NECESSARY TO ENFORCE

03:33:50.384 --> 03:33:52.252

SUSPENSION TIMES COMMITTED THAT

03:34:01.261 --> 03:34:03.197
I WOULD DO BECAUSE I HAVEN'T

03:34:03.263 --> 03:34:04.831
DONE THAT. AND IT'S KIND OF A

03:34:04.898 --> 03:34:08.535
FAUCET. BECAUSE WHEN PEOPLE ARE
