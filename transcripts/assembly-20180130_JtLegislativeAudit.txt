ASSEMBLY MEMBER PATTERSON'S AUDIT TWENTY EIGHTEEN DASH ONE OH ONE HAS BEEN PULLED FROM TODAY'S AGENDA. ASSEMBLYMEMBER CHAN'S. AUDIT REQUEST AUDIT TWENTY EIGHTEEN DASH ONE OH THREE HAS BEEN PULLED FROM TODAY'S AGENDA. AND ADDITIONALLY I WANTED TO. MAKE SURE THAT THERE WAS NO ONE IN THE AUDIENCE.

ALRIGHT SO THIS IS. ITEM NUMBER FOUR ON THE REGULAR CALENDAR. AUDIT REQUEST TWENTY EIGHTEEN THAT'S ONE OH SEVEN DEPARTMENT OF RESOURCES RECYCLING RECOVERY. QUESTION OVERSIGHT OF THE MATTRESS RECYCLING COUNCIL. FROM ASSEMBLY MEMBER. CRISTINA GARCIA. LET'S SEE BEFORE WE. YES. MS GARCIA BLOCKING. I THINK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. RECONSIDERATION AT THE REQUEST BY THE AUDIT OF THE CALIFORNIA MATTRESS RECYCLING PROGRAM. THE SPERM WITH ESTABLISHED BY SENATOR HANCOCK IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN TO DEAL WITH THE HUGE NUMBERS OF BB ILLEGALLY DUMP MASTER SERVE AND HER DISTRICT. BY REFLECT LEADER. THEY'LL CONTINUE. I'M SORRY CONTRIBUTE TO BLOOD IN OUR COMMUNITIES. LAST MONTH I LEARNED THAT A MINORITY OWNED BUSINESS IN MY DISTRICT HAD ITS CONTRACT CANCELED AND WOULD BE CLOSELY WITHIN THE NEXT COUPLE OF MONTHS. PUTTING A HUNDRED AND FIFTY PEOPLE IN MY COMMUNITY OUT OF WORK. EVERY SOUTH MRC TO ASK THEM TO CONTINUE NEGOTIATIONS TO SEE IF A COMPROMISE COULD BE REACHED ON THEIR CONTRACT. I CONTINUE TO BE FULL HOPEFUL THAT AN AGREEMENT CAN BE REACHED. AS THE CHAIR OF NATURAL RESOURCES COMMITTEE MY STAFF AND I BEGAN LOOKING INTO HOW THE STATE'S MATCHES RECYCLING PROGRAM WAS GOING. IT IS AMONG THE FIRST OF THE STATE'S PRODUCTS. OF STEWARDSHIP PROGRAMS AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO ENSURE THE PROGRAM IS ACCOMPLISHING ITS GOLD. I WAS APPOINTED BY THAT WHILE MRC SEEMS TO BE MEETING AT COLLECTION GOAL OF AROUND TWENTY FIVE PERCENT. IT DOES NOT SEEM TO BE MEETING THE OTHER REQUIREMENTS OF THE PROGRAM. SPECIFICALLY IT DOES NOT SEEM TO BE ADDRESSING THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF SB TWO FIFTY FOUR TO REDUCE ILLEGAL DUMPING AND CLEAN UP MATTRESSES THAT ARE DUMPED. THE PROGRAM IS REQUIRED TO PROVIDE A FINANCIAL INCENTIVE TO FIND THE COLLECTION OF ILLEGALLY THIS BOTH MATTRESS IF. PROVIDE A MECHANISM FOR THE RECOVERY OF THE MATTRESSES AT NO ADDITIONAL COST TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. AND PROVIDE COLLECTION SERVICES FOR LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES. I HAVE NOT SEEN ANY EVIDENCE THAT MRCS FULFILLING THESE REQUIREMENTS. IN SPITE OF THESE CONCERNS AND MARCIE WAS ABLE TO REDUCE THE FEE ON MATTRESS SALES FROM ELEVEN DOLLARS TO TEN FIFTY ON THE BIRTH OF THE YEAR. I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THAT YOU APPROVE THIS AUDIT TODAY SO THAT WE CAN ENSURE THAT OUR COMMUNITIES ARE GETTING THE FULL BENEFIT OF THE PROGRAM THEY ARE PAYING FOR. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. AS HELL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. AS AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA INDICATED THIS WOULD BE AN AUDIT OF THE MATTRESS RECYCLING PROGRAM IN CALIFORNIA WE WOULD. START WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF OUR RESOURCES. I RECYCLING IN RECOVERY CAL RECYCLE CALMLY REFER TO SO WE WOULD LOOK AT CAL RECYCLES OVERSIGHT OF THIS PARTICULAR PROGRAM. AND WHETHER OR NOT THEY ARE ENSURING THAT THE COUNCIL AYE IS FALLING LAWS RULES REGULATIONS THERE WERE REGULATIONS THAT WERE PROMULGATED RELATED TO THIS PARTICULAR PROGRAM SO. SO STARTING AT CAL RECYCLING LOOKING AT WHAT TYPE OF OVERSIGHT THERE PROVIDING THEIR REQUIRED TO APPROVE AN ANNUAL PLAN THEY'RE REQUIRED TO LOOK AT THE BUDGET FOR THE COUNCIL ETCETERA SO. LOOKING AT THEIR OVERSIGHT THEN FOCUSING ON THE FINANCIAL INFORMATION RELATED TO THE PROGRAM THE REVENUE THE AMOUNT OF MONEY IN THE FUND BALANCE IT APPEARS FUND BALANCE RELATIVELY HIGH. UP BUT ALSO SHE'S ASKING US TO LOOK AT EXPENDITURE REPORTS IDENTIFYING MAJOR CATEGORIES OF EXPENDITURES ARM AND DETERMINING WHETHER OR NOT THE PROGRAM HAS RESOURCES SUFFICIENT. TO ENSURE THAT THIS PROGRAM MEETS ITS GOALS FOR CALIFORNIA ON AS I INDICATED SHE SPECIFICALLY ASKED US TO LOOK AT THE FUND BALANCE DETERMINE WHETHER IT'S REASONABLE. AND THEN THE LAST COUPLE OF OBJECTIVES REALLY ABOUT ARE WE ACHIEVING OUR AS A STATE. THROUGH CALORIE CYCLE IS THIS PROGRAM ACHIEVING THE EXPECTED INTENT ARE THEY INVESTING ENOUGH MONEY IN PUBLIC OUTREACH AND EDUCATION OUGHT NEW TYPES OF TECHNOLOGY CONTRACTING WITH PARTICULAR. OF VENDORS IN CALIFORNIA TO PROCESS MATTRESSES TO REFURBISH REUSE IT CETERA SO THE LAST COUPLE OF OBJECTIVES ARE RELATED TO THAT AS FAR AS HOW WELL THIS PROGRAM IS FUNCTIONING IN CALIFORNIA. THE BUDGET FOR THIS AUDIT IS A LITTLE LESSON TWENTY TWO HUNDRED HOURS IT'S ABOUT A FIVE MONTHS FIVE MONTHS AMOUNT OF TIME. OF STAFF TIME TO CONDUCT THE WORK. ALRIGHT THANK YOU. MS GORE SHOULD YOU HAVE WITNESSES AND SUPPORTIVE REQUEST IDEA. ELEVEN TO DO THEMSELVES. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MY NAME IS MELISSA AND MULLIN AND WHICH I YOU ORDER AND TO BE HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA PRODUCT STEWARDSHIP COUNCIL OR CPSC AS WELL AS THE NATIONAL SEARCH ACTION COUNCIL. AND ALSO BEEN US TO CONVEY SUPPORT ON BEHALF OF STOP WASTE AS THEY WERE UNABLE TO MAKE IT TODAY. CPSC ADVOCATES FOR EXTENDED PRODUCE RESPONSIBILITY AT WHICH IS A POLICY THAT REQUIRES PRODUCERS TO SHARE AND THE END OF LIFE MANAGEMENT OF THE PRODUCTS THAT THEY SELL. WHICH ULTIMATELY END UP IN CALIFORNIA'S WE STREAM. THIS POLICY APPROACH IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT AND EFFECTIVE FOR PRODUCTS THAT HAVE SIGNIFICANT AND OF LIFE IMPACTS SUCH AS MATTRESSES. CPSU SUPPORTS I REQUEST TO ENSURE THAT THE MATTRESS RECYCLING COUNCIL IS FULFILLING THE GOALS OF CALIFORNIA'S MATCHES RECYCLING LA. THIS IS A TARGETED AUDIT THAT ADDRESSES SOME KEY ISSUES TO ASSESS THE SUCCESSES AND FAILURES OF THE EMBASSIES EXPERIENCES THUS FAR. BUT ALSO WORKING WITH MRC ENCOUNTER CYCLE TO ADDRESS ISSUES THAT DON'T FALL WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS AUDIT REQUEST. BUT THE PROGRAM IS OFF TO A FAIRLY GOOD START AND WE HAVE SEEN SOME POSITIVE DEVELOPMENTS WE'VE ALSO SEEN INDICATIONS OF A NEED TO ASSESS THEM MARCY'S PROGRESS. A KEY REASON THAT THIS PROGRAM WAS ESTABLISHED WAS TO REDUCE ILLEGAL DUMPING OF MATTRESSES AND ALTHOUGH SOME PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE. ILLEGAL DUMPING IS STILL A SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM IN CALIFORNIA AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE BURDENED WITH RELATED COSTS. IT SEEMS THAT THE MRC COULD BE DOING MORE TO FULLY REALIZE THE GOALS OF THIS PROGRAM. BECAUSE GEORGIA PROGRAMS ARE NIGHT APR EPR PRODUCER PAY MODEL NOR A GOVERNMENT COMMAND AND CONTROL APPROACH WE'VE SEEN SOME OF THE STATE'S PROGRAMS FACE CHALLENGES. THIS AUDIT WILL HAVE IT'S GET AHEAD OF POTENTIAL PROBLEMS IN THE MATCHES PROGRAM TO ADDRESS THEM EARLY ON WITH EFFECTIVE OVERSIGHT AND NOT WAY AS WE DID ON CARPET FOR EXAMPLE. WE NO THE INCREASING TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY IN THE OPERATIONS OF THE MATTRESS RECYCLING PROGRAM WILL HOPE IS COLLECTIVELY MAKE IMPROVEMENTS ALONG THE WAY. TO AVOID FAILURE DOWN THE LINE. AS CALIFORNIA'S GOING BACKWARDS ON A RECYCLING RATE WHILE TRYING TO REACH THE STATE SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT WASTE RECYCLING GOAL WE ENCOURAGE A REVIEW OF THIS PROGRAM SO WE CAN ENSURETHAT THE MRC IS DOING WHAT IT CAN TO PROVIDE MAXIMUM BENEFIT FOR ALL FEE PAYING CALIFORNIANS. GIVE IT A THREE. THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MARK MURRAY WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL GROUP CALIFORNIA'S GAS WASTE NOW IF THIS WAS ONE OF THE. TRADITIONAL WASTE REDUCTION RECYCLING PROGRAMS THAT WE'VE IMPLEMENTED THE STATE OVER THE LAST THIRTY YEARS. THE WAY THAT WE WOULD. THIS THE LEGISLATURE WOULD PROVIDE OVERSIGHT IN TERMS OF WHETHER OR NOT THE OBJECTIVES OF THE PROGRAM RIPPING MATT WOULD BE THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS AND WE WOULD BASICALLY LEVERAGE THE DEPARTMENT THAT'S IN CHARGE OF IMPLEMENTING THE PROGRAM. THIS PROGRAM THIS POLICY USES A DIFFERENT MODEL WHERE THE INDUSTRY IS ACTUALLY RUNNING THE PROGRAM IN THE INDUSTRY IS COLLECTING THE FUNDS FROM CONSUMER SO HE GOT BY A MATTRESS. THE BILL BILL TELL YOU THAT THE STATE MAKES US CHARGE THIS TEN FIFTY OR THIS. ON THE MATTRESS BUT IN FACT THAT'S GOING TO THE MATTRESS INDUSTRY. WE THOUGHT IN THIS LEGISLATION WE FOUGHT WE HAD BUILT OVERSIGHT INTO THIS PROGRAM OVERSIGHT BY CAL RECYCLE. AND OVERSIGHT BY AN APPOINTED MATTRESS ADVISORY COUNCIL BUT THE THE EVIDENCE OVER THE LAST SIX MONTHS IS THAT THOSE OVERSIGHT FUNCTIONS ARE WORKING. ARE THE MATTRESS INDUSTRY WE'RE NOT SATISFIED WITH TWENTY FIVE PERCENT RECOVERY RATE WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THREE AND A HALF MILLION MATTRESSES BEING GENERATED POTENTIALLY DISCARDED. WE KNOW THAT PRIVATE SECTOR AND PUBLIC SECTOR UP OPERATORS LIKE THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES ARE COLLECTING USED MATTRESSES AND THEY CAN'T GET THOSE MATTRESSES INTO THE RECYCLING STREAM BECAUSE THEY'RE SAYING THEY'RE NOT BEING PAID ENOUGH. AT THE SAME TIME WE HAVE A SURPLUS THAT IS GOING TO APPROACH THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR A PROGRAM. THAT IS HAS OF A FORTY MILLION DOLLAR ANNUAL. INCOME REVENUE STREAM THAT SEEMS LIKE AN AWFULLY LARGE BUDGET SURPLUS TO HAVE WHEN YOU'RE NOT COMING ANYWHERE CLOSE TO MEETING YOUR PROGRAM OBJECTIVES. SO WE THINK THAT THIS OVERSIGHT BY BY THE. J. LACK MAY BE THE ONLY GAME IN TOWN IN TERMS OF PROVIDING OVERSIGHT THAT WE MAY HAVE TO. THE LEGISLATURE MAY HAVE TO RE EXAMINE WHETHER OR NOT THIS KIND OF POLICY EVEN MAKE SENSE TO HAVE THIS KIND OF ONCE REMOVED HAVE THE INDUSTRY OPERATING A PROGRAM TAKING CONSUMER FUNDS. BUT AT THIS POINT IN TIME THE ONLY MECHANISM WE HAVE TO KIND OF TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT'S GOING ON. IS THIS KIND OF ODD WE URGE YOU TO SUPPORT THE REQUEST. ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THE RESPONDING AGENCY IS IS ERUPTION FROM CAL RECYCLE HERE YEAH. AT MINKA. THIS GOES AS TO ALL OF OUR WITNESSES BUT WE LIKE TO ASK. WITNESSES TO TRY TO KEEP THE COMMENTS LIMITED TO TWO MINUTES. HI. I'M CYNTHIA DON IMUS SUPERVISING THE SENIOR ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENTIST WITH COVERAGE OF MICHAEL AND. I OVERSEE THAT THE PA EPR UNIT WHICH HOUSES THE. PUB MATTRESS PROGRAM. WITH REGARD TO THE DEPARTMENTS OVERSIGHT OF THE DEPARTMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ENSURING THAT THE MATTRESS RECYCLING ORGANIZATION IN THIS CASE AND MERCY. EXECUTES ITS RESPONSIBILITIES UNDER THE LAW. AND WE DO THIS THROUGH. AS WAS MENTIONED THE REVIEW AND APPROVAL OF USE MATTRESS RECYCLING. AND RECOVERY PLANS. THE REVIEW AND APPROVAL OF ANNUAL BUDGETS WHICH INCLUDES THE CHARGE. AND THROUGH THE. REVIEW AND COMPLIANCE REVIEW AT THE ANNUAL REPORTS. THE AND REPORTS IN PARTICULAR. ARE CEMENTED EACH YEAR JULY FIRST AND THE DEPARTMENT. EVALUATES THESE PER COMPLIANCE WITH STATUTES AND RAGS. THE DEPARTMENT APPROVED IN MERCIES TWENTY SIXTEEN WHICH IS THEIR FIRST PER PROGRAM YOU'RE ANNUAL REPORT. AND REQUESTED THAT THE MRC CONSIDER SPECIFIC ISSUES RAISED BY STAFF AND STAKEHOLDERS IN PARTICULAR WITH REGARD TO RESEARCH THE CONSUMER INCENTIVE PROGRAM CONVENIENCE. ILLEGAL DUMPING AND MARKET DEVELOPMENT AND THEN TO REPORT BACK IN ITS TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND AIRPORT. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO MENTION THAT. A LOT OF THE CONCERNS THAT ARE DISCUSSED IN THE LETTER AND. THAT WE'VE HEARD FROM STAKEHOLDERS THAT DEPARTMENT CHAIRS SOME OF THOSE CONCERNS ME TO CONVEY THAT THROUGH. TO THE MRC THROUGH OUR REGULAR MEETINGS AND ALSO THROUGH OUR APPROVAL AT THE ANNUAL REPORT. WITH REGARD TO THAT THE APPROVAL OF THE FEE REDUCTION. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE DEPARTMENT REVIEWED THAT REQUEST WITH ITS ANNUAL BUDGET AND DETERMINED THAT IT MATT IT'S. ALL THE STATUTORY AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS NECESSARY FOR APPROVAL. DEPARTMENTS REQUIRED TO APPROVE AB MATCHES RECYCLING CHARGE THAT IS. ENOUGH TO COVER THE PROGRAM THE PROGRAM COSTS WHICH THAT TEN FIFTY MATTRESS RECYCLING CHARGE DEMONSTRATED THAT IT WOULD HURT THAT. BUDGET CATEGORIES. I'D ALSO JUST LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT THE PRODUCTION BETWEEN. THE ELEVEN DOLLAR CHARGE AND TEN FIFTY IS. DIFFERENCE OF LESS THAN TWO MILLION DOLLARS ANNA ABOUT A FORTY MILLION DOLLAR PROGRAM BUDGET. SO IT WAS NOT ONLY ENOUGH TO COVER THAT THAT PROGRAM ACTIVITIES BUT ALSO. MORE IT MORE THAN COVER AND ALLOW FOR THAT A CONTINUATION OF A RESERVE. MISTER I'M GOING TO ASK YOU TO WRAP UP SURE I I WAS ACTUALLY GONNA POP CULTURE AND OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. BUT WE ALSO HAVE A REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE MATTRESS OR SIZE RECYCLING COUNCIL I BELIEVE. NOW. OKAY. ALRIGHT SIR QUESTIONS FROM THE. OH YES UP THAT'S MODERATE MEMBERS. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN MURATSUCHI AND MEMBERS OF J. LACK. TOM SHE HERE ON BEHALF OF THE MATTRESS RECYCLING COUNCIL VERBALLY PLEASED ABBOTT OPPORTUNISTIC A FEW BRIEF COMMENTS ABOUT THE PROGRAM. I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA'S INTEREST. I AM HAVING A FEW PIECES FEW DOCUMENTS HANDED OUT TO YOU WHICH ADDRESS SOME OF THE INFORMATIONAL CONCERNS OF THE BEEN EXPRESSED. AND I WILL JUST TELL YOU AT THE OUTSET THE TWENTY FIVE PERCENT RIGHT THAT'S BEEN QUOTED HERE TODAY. WE DON'T BELIEVE IS ACCURATE AND THE REASON WHY THERE'S A LARGE RESERVE IN THE FUND IS BECAUSE THIS IS A BRAND NEW PROGRAM IS JUST WRAPPING UP. WITH THAT SAID. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MICHAEL DONALD WHO'S THE MANAGING DIRECTOR OF MRC HAD A FAMILY EMERGENCY WHICH PREVENTED HIM FROM BEING HERE THIS MORNING SO. I AM HERE IN HIS STEAD THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAKS THE BEGIN TALK A LITTLE BIT WHAT WE HAVE ACCOMPLISHED IN LAST TWO YEARS. FOLLOWING ITS FIRST YEAR OF OPERATIONS OF ITS YOU GUYS KNOW THE PACKETS AMONG BOTH TO THAT AND AND FOR THE SECOND TIME. FOLLOWING ITS FIRST YEAR OF OPERATIONS MRC CEMENTED ITS TWENTY SIXTEEN AND A REPORT AND IS TWENTY EIGHTEEN PROPOSED BUDGET THIS WAS IN JULY OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN TO JUST SIX OR SEVEN MONTHS AGO. COVER CYCLE DID AFFECT APPROVED IT IN A REPORT. AND IT ESTABLISHED PERFORMANCE GOALS SPECIFIC PERSON FOREMAN'S GOALS FOR THE MRC IN DECEMBER TWENTY SEVENTEEN FOR THE YEARS TWENTY SEVENTEEN THROUGH TWENTY TWENTIES WE HAVE SPECIFIC GOALS OF THE REGULATORS ASKING FOR. THIS REQUIRES A SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT RECYCLING RATE ON A WEIGHT BASIS ON A WEIGHT BASIS. DURING ITS INITIAL TWO YEARS IN OPERATION WE'VE ACCOMPLISHED THE FOLLOWING THINGS AS THE MATTRESS RECYCLING COUNCIL WE CONTRACTED WITH A NUMBER MATTRESS REYCLING FACILITIES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. WE'VE ESTABLISHED A BROAD COLLECTION NETWORK OF OVER A HUNDRED AND SIXTY DROP OFF POINTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND WE CONTINUED AT THOSE ON A MONTHLY BASIS. WE'VE ALSO HELD A HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE PUBLIC COLLECTION EVENTS. OUGHT TO BRING MATTRESS RECYCLING THE DIRECTLY INTO THE COMMUNITY TO MAKE PEOPLE AWARE WHAT'S GOING OR PUBLIC RELATIONS AN AD CAMPAIGN TO LET PEOPLE UNDERSTAND HOW THEY CAN DEAL WITH THEIR VALUES MATTRESSES. MRCS FIRST YOUR EFFORTS FOCUS ON CREATING MATCHES COLLECTION RECYCLING NETWORK AND WE COLLECTED OVER ONE MILLION MATTRESSES THOSE ARE ONE MILLION MATTRESSES ABOUT THINGS WOULD HAVE GONE INTO LANDFILLS. THIS TRANSLATES INTO TWENTY NINE MILLION TONS OF PRODUCTS THAT OCCUPY ELEVEN MILLION CUBIC FEET OF SPACE. WHICH IS EQUIVALENT TO NINETEEN OLYMPIC SIZE SWIMMING POOLS. AND MERCY IS EXPANDING ITS COLLECTIONS IN TWENTY SEVEN EXPAND ITS COLLECTIONS AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN TO ONE POINT THREE MILLION UNITS. UP THIS EX THIS EXCEEDED PARA RECYCLES GOALS THAT THEY SET FOR US IN THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN FISCAL YEAR SO WE BELIEVE THAT WERE NOT ONLY GETTING THE STATE'S REQUIREMENTS BUT WE'RE EXCEEDING THEM. MRC ALSO RAISED A CONSUMER ARE ALSO RAISE CONSUMER AWARENESS RECYCLING THROUGH THEIR EDUCATION PROGRAM AND AS A RESULT OF THE ONE MILLION MATTRESSES THAT WERE COLLECTED THE FIRST YEAR. OVER THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY THOUSAND OF THEM CAME THROUGH CONSUMER DROP OFFS AT OUR DIFFERENT POINTS. MRC HAS FUNDED THE COLLECTION OF OVER SIXTY THREE THOUSAND ILLEGALLY DUMPED MATTRESSES AROUND THE STATE. THERE'S NO QUESTION BUT THAT THERE'S MORE WORK TO DO IN THAT AREA BUT WE MADE A SIGNIFICANT BITE INTO IT AND WE HAVE A STRATEGY IN PLACE TO. CONTINUE INCREASING THAT NUMBER RUMORED THIS IS A BRAND NEW PROGRAM WE'RE JUST WRAPPING UP. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I BRENT I'VE I'VE GOT MY FINAL PARAGRAPH AND I APOLOGIZE I'M WRAPPING UP RIGHT NOW. WE ARE REQUIRED TO RECYCLE SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT BY WEIGHT OF THE MATTRESSES WE RECEIVED. IN TWENTY SIXTEEN ARE RECYCLED HIT A SIXTY FOUR PERCENTAGE RATE AND UNFORTUNATELY A TWENTY SEVENTEEN THAT RIGHT AT DIPPED SLIGHTLY WE ARE WORKING ON THE STRATEGY WORKING FOR CONTRACTORS TO RACE EVERY SO WE CAN HIT THE ARE REQUIRED GOAL BY THE STATE. FINALLY MISTER CHAIRMAN I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT WE GREATLY APPRECIATE THIS OPPORTUNITY. TO DISCUSS MRC IS INITIAL SUCCESS IN IMPLEMENTING THE REQUIREMENTS OF S. B. TWO FIFTY FOUR AND HIGHLIGHTING THE AREAS WHERE WE DO NEED TO IMPROVE. WE APPRECIATE THE SUPPORT OF CAO RECYCLED WE PURCHASED THE SUPPORT OF THE LEGISLATURE AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU TO EXPAND THIS PROGRAM A MAKE IT EVEN BETTER THAN IT IS NOW THANK YOU VERY MUCH I THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

MOTIONS BEEN MAIDEN'S SECOND ED ROLL CALL PLEASE. ROLL CALL TO APPROVE THE CONSENT CALENDAR ASSEMBLY MEMBER MERCI JEAN I. ACOSTA. BAKER. SANTIAGO. OBERNOLTE. RUBIO. WHEN I. SENATOR ROTH. ALLEN. BELL. CANNELLA. FULLER. LARA. MENDOZA. THE MOTIONS PASSED. HERE IN NEW. MOTIONS BEEN MADE. SECOND BY. LARA. JUST HAD A COUPLE QUESTIONS. I HEARD FROM THAT ONE EARLY WITNESSES THAT THE ONLY WAY TO GET ABOUT IN THIS IS FOR US. AS THROUGH JAIL ACT TO PERFORM AN AUDIT BUT. COULD CAL RECYCLE NOT PERFORM AN AUDIT. I MEAN IT'S A CAL RECYCLE PROGRAM. COULD YOU NOT PERFORM AN AUDIT OF THIS PARTICULAR PROGRAM WITHIN EUROPE WE AREN'T DEPARTMENT. YES THE DEPARTMENT HAS A WATER THIRTY TO AUDIT THE THE MATTRESS RECYCLING COUNCILS PROGRAM AND. ACTUALLY INTENDS TO AS PART OF ITS REGULAR DUTIES. OKAY. AS FAR AS THE. THE ISSUE OF DUMPING OBVIOUS IT'S A HUGE CONCERN. I BIGGER OF A BIG CONCERN FOR ME AS I AND I KINDA LIKE TED THAT KNOW MORE ABOUT HOW THE NUMBERS STACK UP IN MY DISTRICT WHERE I DON'T HAVE TO HAVE COUNTIES THAT DON'T HAVE. ANY RECYCLING CENTERS NOW. WHICH IS A A MUCH MUCH BIGGER ISSUE OF FROM MY PERSPECTIVE BUT. SO I WOULD LOVE TO SEE SAM AND I AND NUMBER ALLUVIAL QUESTIONS AND DATA ON WHAT YOU'RE DOING AND DISTRICTS THAT DON'T HAVE. ANY RECYCLING FACILITIES BECAUSE I THINK THAT CONTINUES TO BE A HUGE ISSUE. ILLEGAL DUMPING IS ONE OF THE THE MAIN. PURPOSES OF THE PROGRAM IS TO IS TO ADDRESS ILLEGAL DUMPING AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE FLAT. AS A A A PRIORITY AS WELL. THE THE NATURE OF. THIS PROGRAM WHICH FOLLOWS SOME EXTENDED PRODUCE RESPONSIBILITY PRINCIPLES IS. THAT STATUTE LAYS OUT. PACIFIC REQUIREMENTS AND THEN THE. STORAGE ORGANIZATION HAS SOME FLEXIBILITY. WITH WHICH HOW THEY GO ABOUT MEETING THOSE GOALS. SO WITH THAT I DEPARTMENT IN ITS. APPROVAL OF THE FIRST DOWN REPORT HIGHLIGHTED SOME AREAS WHERE WE THOUGHT THAT. UP SOME ADDITIONAL UP WORK NEEDS TO BE DONE AND I THINK THAT MRC RECOGNIZES THAT IT AS WELL. DATA IS. IS SOMETHING THAT'S THAT'S VERY CHALLENGING TO OBTAIN TO TRY AND FIGURE OUT WHERE OUR. THAT THE AREAS OF THE STATE THAT NEED THE MOST EMPHASIS NOT SOMETHING THAT THE MRC. TRIED TO DO DURING THE FIRST PROGRAM YEAR AND WE THINK THAT THERE'S MORE WORK TO BE DONE TO TRY AND IDENTIFY. THAT THAT DATA SO THAT RESOURCES CAN BE TARGETED TO THE PLACES THAT NEED IT THE MOST. I DON'T KNOW IF ON. MRC IS ANYTHING ELSE TO ADD WITH REGARD TO THAT. MAY I MISTER CHAIRMAN. BOB THANK YOU MISTER WHAT UP ONE OF THE THINGS WE HAVE HANDED OUT TO THE MEMBERS ON THE DAIS WHEN I START TO MAKE MY COMMENTS WAS OUR AND A REPORT WHICH WAS JUST PUBLISHED IN JULY. INSIDE THAT ANNUAL REPORT WHICH YOU CAN SEE ON YEAR ROUND IS THIS PARTICULAR DOCUMENT. WHICH IS A AUDIT THAT WAS DONE BY TOP SHELF INDEPENDENT AUDITING COMPANY THAT LOOKED AT MANY OF THE QUESTIONS THAT MISS GARCIA HAS IN HER COMMITTEE REQUEST LETTER ON EXPENDITURES AND REVENUES NOW THE MONEY IS BEING SPENT. WHAT THE RESERVISTS ON AND SO FORTH THOSE ARE ALL JUST WENT THROUGH A THOROUGH REGULAR ARE RIGOROUS? AUDIT JUST SIX US SEVEN MONTHS AGO THAT'S IN PART OF THIS DOCUMENT HERE THAT I PROVIDED YOU. IS FAR AS WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO IN THE FUTURE OUR BUDGET WAS JUST APPROVED BY COUNTY CYCLE THEY CERTIFY THAT WE'RE MEETING ALL THE STATE REQUIREMENTS. WERE HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU AND ANY MEMBER ARE IN ANY MEMBER IN THE LEGISLATURE ANY MEMBER IN THIS COMMITTEE AS FAR AS. A DEALING WITH THE MATTRESS WHITE ISSUE TRYING TO COME UP WITH NEW STRATEGIES AND SO ON AND SO FORTH. BUT IT'S FAR AS THE INFORMATION IS GARCIA'S WORKING FOR I WOULD I WOULD JUST RESPECTFULLY SUBMIT THAT. MUCH A BET ALMOST ALL OF IT COULD BE PROVIDED UNDER SEPARATE COVER. UP YOU MAY WANT TO CONSIDER PUTTING THE SOBRE FOR THIRTY DAYS WE MIGHT HAVE A CHANCE TO WORK WITH MISS GARCIA. ARE AND IF SHE STILL NOT SATISFIED YOU CAN COME BACK OF A FOR THE AUDIT BUT THE INFORMATION THAT'S BEEN REQUESTED ON. ARE THE FINANCES ON THE PROGRAM PERFORMANCES EITHER AVAILABLE FROM THE DEPARTMENT UNDER CURRENTLY PUBLISHED DOCUMENTS. OR ALSO AVAILABLE THROUGH THE MATTRESS RECYCLING COUNCIL IT'S IT'S BEEN LOOKED OUT THOROUGHLY THIS IS A BRAND NEW PROGRAM IT'S ONLY BEEN RUNNING FOR TWO YEARS IS OUR FIRST AND A REPORT. VERY TRANSPARENT WHAT WE'RE DOING HOW WE'RE DOING IT WERE HAPPY TO WORK WITH THIS COMMITTEE HOWEVER YOU LIKE BUT SKIPPED STATE RESOURCES ARE SCARCE THE AUDITOR CAN'T AUDIT EVERYTHING A MUCH OF THE INFORMATION THAT'S BEING ASKED FOR HERE. IS ALREADY PUBLICLY AVAILABLE. CAN I RESPOND YES MS GRANT. A COUPLE OF THINGS ON THIS AUDIT THAT THE MRC IS TALKING ABOUT ARE THE AUDIT DOES NOTE THAT IT DOES NOT PROVIDE A LEGAL DETERMINATION OF MRCS COMPLIANCE. WITH SPECIFIED REQUIREMENTS OF THE ACT THE STATE THAT THIRTY TO TERMINATE THE MRC SEASON THE FEES COLLECTED FROM CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS. TO FULLY AND EFFECTIVELY AND I ON AND PERFECT EFFECTIVELY A COMPLY WITH ALL THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE MATCHES EXACTLY LA NOT SIMPLY WHETHER THERE ARE COUNTING IS ACCURATE. I A SHORT DECIDED AS NECESSARY ALSO THE AUDITOR WILL BE ABLE TO COME. YOU A BROADER AND GREATER AND THAT AUDIT AND CAL RECYCLE MIGHT BE ABLE TO DO YOU. ARE AND THEN I WHICH IS ALSO LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT THERE HAS BEEN A MOTION TO VOTE ON THIS AUDIT A SECOND AND NOT WITH WHAT EFFORT DID. NOT TO BOTH ONE EVERY THIRTY DAYS FOR YOUR REQUEST THE MOTION ON THE FLOOR ENOUGH WITH. WITH FORWARD MISTER AL. OKAY I'VE COUPLE QUESTIONS FROM. FOR CAL RECYCLED. DO YOU HAVE ANY SENSE OF. AND I'M SURE THIS IS IN ERE SOMEWHERE BUT HOW MANY USED MATTRESSES ARE GENERATED STATEWIDE. SO THE. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT. THAT THE DEPARTMENT ALSO DIES AND ITS EYES SIGNIFICANT EFFORT IS. IS RECEIVE COLLECT. AND. ANALYZE DATA FROM. MATTRESS RECYCLERS RENOVATORS AND SOLID WASTE FACILITIES THAT COLLECTS USED MATTRESSES FROM THE PUBLIC AND. IT WE JUST BECAUSE OUT ARE THE FIRST REPORTING YOUR FOR THAT AND IT THEIR SIGNIFICANCE OF THAT ISN'T SETTING. THAT STATEWIDE BASELINE AND RECYCLING GOALS FOR THE STATE I'M WHICH THE DEPARTMENT DID PER STATUTE. DOT AND BECAME EFFECTIVE JANUARY FIRST OF THIS YEAR THAT MRC WILL HAVE TO. DEMONSTRATE A GOOD FAITH EFFORT TOWARDS MEETING THOSE GOALS FROM ITS TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. AND REPORT WHICH DEPARTMENT RECEIVING TWENTY TWENTY. SO THE REASON I BRING THIS UP IS BECAUSE. IT WAS THE FIRST REPORTING YOU'RE NOT ONLY FOR THE MRC BUT ALSO FOR THESE REPORTING ENTITIES. AND THE. YOU KNOW IT'S IT WAS CHALLENGING IN SOME RESPECTS. GETTING ALL OF THE ENTITIES THAT ARE REQUIRED TO REPORT TO ACTUALLY DO SO AND TO TO. SUBMIT SUFFICIENT AND COMPLETE DATA. SO THAT APARTMENT. HAS BEEN TO DOING A LOT OF EFFORT. TO TRY AND REACH OUT TO THOSE RECYCLERS. AND RENOVATORS TO TRY AND GET ACCURATE AND COMPLETE DATA. SO THE. SO THE. WE BELIEVE BECAUSE THIS SO I. THIS FORM THAT WAS THE SAID WHEN PAGES GIVEN US BY THE MRC THEN SAYS THAT IT'S. ONE POINT TWO ONE POINT THREE MILLION IS THAT. CONFORM WITH YOUR UNDERSTANDING. AS FAR AS GENERATED. GENERATING YEAH THAT'S THAT COLLECTED COLLECTED GUESTS YES OKAY AYE MEN AND IT. YOUR YOUR UNDERSTANDING IS THAT. OUR RECYCLING MATTRESS LIKING RATE IS A LITTLE IS AROUND. STEVE. THE PERCENT IS THAT SEMI THAT EVERY NOW NOW OKAY NO. THE. THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE REPORTING THAT I JUST DESCRIBED. WELL HELP US TO ESTABLISH A. BOB WITH TWENTY TWENTY A DEPARTMENT WAS REQUIRED PER STATUTE TO SET THE BASELINE AND RECYCLING GOALS BY A JERRY ONE TWENTY EIGHTEEN WE DIDN'T HAVE THE DATA THAT WAS NECESSARY WHICH DIDN'T HAVE THE DATA KNOWING WHAT IS. CURRENTLY BEING RECYCLED AND RENOVATED. TO SET A RECYCLING RATE THAT IS BASED ON ABOUT GENERATED. SO INSTEAD WE. WE SET GOALS THAT ARE BASICALLY YEAR OVER YEAR INCREASES. AND IN THE MEANTIME ARE TAKING SIGNIFICANT EFFORTS TO INCREASE THAT THE DATA QUALITY SO THAT WE CAN SET AN ACTUAL RECYCLING RATE WHICH IS BASED ON. WHAT IS ACTUALLY COLLECTED? OVER DIVIDED BY WHAT IS AVAILABLE FOR RECYCLING CONSUMED EVERYWHERE WE LOOKING AT JUST ONE MCADAMS ITEMS ARE THE THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT CALIFORNIA RECYCLING RATES YEAH IT'S ONLY SOME LOOKING AT THE THING TRY TO DO EXACTLY YEAH SO I'M. I'M STRUCK GOOD HEARING TWENTY FIVE AND SIXTY AYE AYE THIS IF REMEMBER IS OF THE ONE POINT TWO THAT ARE COLLECTED. THIS IS HOW MUCH OF THAT MATERIAL IS RECYCLED SO VIBRATES SO I UNDERSTATEMENT PERCENT UP A MATTRESS IS RECYCLED THE OTHER FORTY BECMES WASTE BUT OF ALL THE MATTRESSES THAT ARE. THAT LEAVES SOMEONE'S HOUSE. INTO THE YOU DON'T HAVE WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS IS THE WHOLE WE ONLY KNOW WHAT WE HAVE COLLECTED WHICH IS ONE POINT TWO BUT THERE MIGHT BE ANOTHER THIRTY FOUR. OR ONE MILLION OUR BEST GUESS ESTIMATE AS TO WHAT. NOT NOT YEAH BUT WE WANT TO GET TO THAT OKAY LEVEL FOR TWENTY TWENTY AND THEN ARM. HAVE YOU KNOW SO I'M AND HEARING GOOD I KNOW THIS IS THIS IS. TYPICAL RIGHT IN THE AUTHOR WANTS TO MOVE FORWARD IN THE FOLKS HERE. INFINIBAND ON THE OTHER SIDE SAY LET'S LET'S LET'S MEANS MORE TIME TALKING ABOUT IT I'M CAN I GET A SENSE OF. THE EXTENT TO WHICH YOU AS A WORKING TOGETHER AND TALKING TO EACH OTHER. BUT MAY I MISTER CHAIRMAN YEAH SENATOR ALLEN WE WE. WE MET WITH MISS GARCIA STAFF YESTERDAY AFTERNOON THERE FLOOR SESSION RENTAL LATE. WE'RE DELIGHTED TO WORK WITH HER AND HER STAFF AS WELL AS OTHER STEP IN THIS COMMITTEE ON ANY THE ISSUES RAISED IF UP IF YOU GO FORWARD WITH THE AUDIT A COURSE WILL BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE AUDITORS WELL. YOU HAVE A MAP BEFORE YESTERDAY WE WE JUST WE'VE REACHED OUT AND WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET INFORMATION SINCE DECEMBER SEVENTEENTH. ON VARIOUS ITEMS AND I AM FROM A ARE AS WE SAID AT THE BEGINNING THE. INITIAL REQUEST CAME BECAUSE OF A COMPANY AND MY DISTRICT BUT AS AS I SAY TO ASK MORE QUESTIONS ABOUT RECYCLING OF THE TERM NATURAL RESOURCES AND SO FORTH. I SUDDENLY WAS DISMAYED ENTERS THE SPEAK ABOUT HOW THIS PROGRAM IS RUNNING AND HOW EFFECTIVELY GETS. IT'S FUNNY I AND THE LACK OF INFORMATION AT TIMES AND THERE'S INFORMATION ON TWO DIFFERENT WEBSITES AND SOME OF IT IS DUPLICATIVE SOME OF IT'S NOT. FAMILIAR WILL TELL ME AND I'LL SEND ME BACK TO COPY CYCLE AND SO WE'VE BEEN DOING RESEARCH TRYING TO GET ANSWERS AND IT'S EVEN WHAT'S AVAILABLE IT'S NOT ALWAYS CLEAR AND I CAN'T GET ALL MY ANSWERS AND SO. UP WHILE I WAS IN PERSON ABLE TO MEET WITH THAT MARCY S. TODAY BECAUSE I WAS ON THE FLOOR WE HAVE BEEN ASKING QUESTIONS FOR AWHILE NOW. SENATOR ALLEN IF I MAY MY CLIENT THE MRC RECEIVED A LETTER THE FIRST COMMUNICATION THEY'VE RECEIVED FROM. MISS GARCIA IN LATE DECEMBER OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN. THEY DID SEND A RESPONSE TO THAT LETTER IN EARLY JANUARY AND THEN THE NEXT THING WE HEARD WE WERE BEING CALLED IN FOR AN AUDIT SO WHAT WE ARE WE ARE. WE WE CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO APPEAR AS THOUGH WE'RE NOT. WORKING WITH MS GARCIA'S OFFICE OUR RESPONSE TO THE LETTER SHE SENT. UP. BY BY BELIEVE COULD HAVE BEEN DONE BETTER. PROBABLY WASN'T AS GOOD OF A RESPONSE SHE WAS LOOKING FOR SO WE ARE SORRY FOR THAT MISS GARCIA OKAY MISTER AS SHE LET ME STEP IN HERE AND WE'RE NOT HERE TO. REALLY. YOU KNOW ARGUE ABOUT. YOU KNOW. WHOSE VERSION OF. WELL I AND I'M LIKE YES I AGREE MISTER CHAIRMAN I IT'S MEANINGFUL TO ME THEY YOU KNOW. IF WE'RE GOING TO GET TO THE STAGE OF LIKE SPENDING ALL THE MONEY ASSOCIATE WITH OR NOT IT. I THAT THERE BE AT LEAST SOME MEANINGFUL DIALOGUE BETWEEN. BOTH SIDES BEFORE WE PROCEED TO MOVE FORWARD NOW YOU KNOW MIGHT TENDENCIES TO DEFER TO YOU MISTER CHAIR AND YOUR STAFF HAVING HAD AN OPPORTUNITY LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENED AND IF YOU'VE STILL BELIEVE. THIS IS WORTHWHILE MOVING FORWARD BUT AT THE SAME TIME. IF THEY'RE LITERALLY JUST BEGINNING PRELIMINARY CONVERSATIONS. IT DOES IT WOULD IT WOULD. I'M JUST I HAVE A QUESTION IN MY MIND AS TO WHETHER AND. I AND AND I WOULD IT HAS THAT ANSWERED IT EXCUSE ME I HAS BEEN ANSWERED YET. I MEAN I I THINK YOU'RE HERE HEARING DATES IN TERMS OF. TEMPS. IT DOES SOUND LIKE IT IT STARTED IN DECEMBER BETTA. AND IF YOU IF IF WELL A IF A LAWYER IF WE'VE MET THAT BURDEN TO YOUR SATISFACTION IS THE CHAIR I WILL SUPPORT YOU OKAY. YEAH I KNOW WHAT I MEAN TO CUT OFF I I JUST WANTED TO. AVOID A BACK AND FORTH THAT. GOING HERE BUT IF YOU HAVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS AS TO. A URGING THE THE REQUEST YOUR. YOU KNOW TO TO. SEEK ADDITIONAL. INFORMATION THROUGH INFORMAL MEANS THAT YOU'RE CERTAINLY WELCOME THESE. YEAH I'VE MADE MY GENERAL TENDENCIES TO. YOU KNOW WAS TOO SO YOU KNOW AND I HAD A I HAD A QUESTION ONE POINT HEADLONG COMES IS WITH WITH THAT CENTER ROTH. AND WE WERE ABLE TO WORK THROUGH THAT THE ISSUE THAT WE HAD WITH. THE WAY THE PROCESS OF WORKING THROUGH WITH THAT WITH THE AGENCY THAT WE'RE LOOKING TO AYE THAT'S I JUST THINK IN GENERAL. IT'S BEST PRACTICE FOR US TO TRY TO WORK THESE THINGS OUT BEFORE HAND TIGHTLY. I DON'T COME HERE. I I I UNDERSTAND THAT WE COULD OUT OF THE MILLION THINGS AYE ANY GIVEN YEAR AND WE WANT TO BE MINDFUL OF OUR RESOURCES. ON INSIDE THAT SET OFF BY TRYING TO DO HOMEWORK I THINK GIVING HER FROM CUT CYCLE AT SOME OF THE THING QUESTIONS I HAVE. THEY HAVE A ABOUT HOW THEY'RE RUNNING THE PROGRAM AND SO WE HIT WALTZ WE GOT SOME ANSWERS AT THE IN THING ADEQUATE ALONG THE WAY. AYE AND SUCH A PROGRAM THAT I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE IS WORKING PROPERLY AT ONE OF OUR FIRST. OUT THERE TO BECOMES A ROLE MODEL FOR FOR OTHER PROGRAMS AS WELL LONG THE WAYNE SO. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO PAINFUL BUT I DO THINK WE'VE DONE ENOUGH OF TRYING TO GET INFORMATION AT SOME POINT ACCOUNT FOR SOMEONE. TO GIVE ME UP INFORMATION IF AN AUDIT SUBTLY THAT WANT TO COME TO THE TABLE I HAVE TO ALSO QUESTIONED SOME OF THEIR. A GENUINE THEY ARE IF THEY FINALLY NOW. MARKETS WE WE HAVE MULTIPLE STAKEHOLDERS TRYING TO GET ANSWERS ACTUALLY WITHIN JUST MYSELF. ALRIGHT ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. YES MEDICAL. YEAH I HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS AND I SOME OF MY SENTIMENT THAT ECHOES. SENATOR ALLEN'S IN TERMS OF JUST TIMING IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S A BOZOS QUESTION FOR THE ARE OF THE REQUESTER. I WITH ALL RESPECT TO MATURE NATURIST SOURCES BUT. IT SEEMS LIKE A OF A BRAND NEW PROGRAM IN TWO YEARS IS FAIRLY NEW WORKED SEEMS LIKE WE'RE GETTING THINGS OFF THE GROUND. I'M I'M ALL FOR AUDITS ON DISK WANDERING ABOUT THAT THE TIMING AND THEN I DO HAVE A A BRIEF QUESTION FOR THE. FOR THE FOLKS AT THE MERCY AS WELL SKINNY TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT THE TIMING. SOME NUMBER GARCIA JUST IT SEEMS TO ME THAT. GIVEN THE CENTER ALAN'S YOU KNOW QUESTION I IN TERMS OF. YOU KNOW TIMING AYE AYE HERE DECEMBER SEVENTEENTH AND. GET OUT THIS BUILDING IS. YOU KNOW HALF MORE THAN HALF VACANT DOT IT IT SEEMS LIKE TO ME THEN YOU RUN THE HOLIDAYS AND THEN YOU GET BACK AND YOU'VE GOT. YOU KNOW. AUDIT REQUESTS IN SESSION AND AND AND COMMITTEE STARTING TO RAMP UP AND IT SEEMS LIKE. IT IT IT JUST MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT OF AN AWKWARD TIMING ISSUE. MORE THAN THAN THAN ANYTHING I I'M NOT A YOU KNOW CERTAINLYNOT EXCUSING SOMEONE NOT RESPONDING RESPONDING INAPPROPRIATE MATTER. AND I. ALL RESPECT I I KNOW YOU TAKE THESE THINGS VERY SERIOUSLY IT AS WE ALL DO BUT I JUST. ONE OF AT DISCOUNT CLARIFY THAT ONE QUERY THERE AND THEN I HAVE QUESTION FROM OUR SIDE SO WHILE A LOT OF US ARE HERE. DECEMBER SEVENTEENTH THROUGH DECEMBER STAFF MEMBERS SUCH THAT THIS YEAR COMMITTEES THAT THIS YEAR LOST A COUNTY CYCLE IS STILL UP AND RUNNING. ADVOCATES ARE STILL OUT THERE WORKING MRC THE FILM WORK ON OUR TIMELINE AGAIN THEIR INDUSTRY INDIVIDUALS THAT THEIR BUSINESS RUNS ALL YEAR LONG AND THEY'RE BASED OUT OF STATE. SO DEFTLY DOT RUN ON OUR TIMELINE OF THE LEGISLATURE HERE AND SO WORK I HAS BEEN DONE. AND SO I THINK IT'S NOT RELEVANT PRESS THAT ALWAYS HAD TO BE HERE WE'VE WE WILL HAVE ASKED. A LOT WE HAVE FIVE OTHER STATE QUALIFY TO GET INFORMATION WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT FOLKS ARE YELLING IN THIS WASTE OF ARENA ALSO HAVE TO THINK IN TERMS AND SO THERE WAS A LOT OF BACK AND FORTH INCLUDING BACK AND FORTH. AMONG STAFF BY VARIOUS LEVELS TO TRY TO GET INFORMATION AND IT WASN'T UNTIL THIS POINT THAT THEY SAID HEY LET ME ANSWER ALL YOUR QUESTIONS NOW CONVENIENTLY. NOT AND AND BEFORE IT WAS LET ME DIRECTLY TO THESE DIFFERENT WEBSITE INTO COUNTY CYCLE AND WE FOLLOWED THE SATISFACTION AS FAR AS THAT'S CONCERNED SO I APPRECIATE YOU KNOW YOUR DILIGENCE IN THE MATTER. AND I'M PERFECTLY AWARE THAT STAFF IS IS WORKING ITS OUTRIGHT JUST MAKING A POINT THAT. YOU KNOW IS A LITTLE BIT YOU KNOW EVERYONE AROUND THE COUNTRY TAKE SOME TIME OFF AROUND THE HOLIDAYS IT SEEMS LIKE BUT BUT YOU ANSWERED THE QUESTION MY SATISFACTION FOR THE MERCY. YA I NOTICED ON THIS AUGUST THIS HANDOUT. THAT YOU HAVE. THE LAST. CENTS OR SO IN THE FIRST PARAGRAPH UPPER LEFT HAND CORNER IT SAYS. OF THE FEE ALSO FUNDS AN INCENTIVE THAT ENCOURAGES CONSUMERS TO DROP OFF THEIR OLD MATTRESSES AT A RECYCLER ETCETERA. TO HELP IN COMBAT DUMPED MATCHES CAN YOU CAN YOU EXPAND ON THAT A LITTLE BIT WHAT'S WHAT'S THE INCENTIVE WHERE DID THEY GO HOW THEY DO IT. BECAUSE I DO NOTICE THAT WE DON'T SEE. A WHOLE LOT OF OF OUR CANS AND BOTTLES AROUND. THEY SEEM TO GET YOU KNOW PICKED UP THE SOMEWHAT OF A COTTAGE INDUSTRY UNFORTUNATE BY THE SOME SSID FOR SOME FOLKS. BUT JUST WONDERING. HOW DOES THIS FIT IN AND WHAT'S BEING DONE IN? CAN I TAKE WHILE MATTRESS IN AND YOU KNOW GET MY TWENTY BUCKS OR MY TEN BUCKS BACK OR WHATEVER HE OF ELEVEN DOLLARS BACK I THINK YOU UP. MR ACOSTA. YES SIMILAR TO THE CALIFORNIA REDEMPTION VALUE WHERE WHEN YOU. RETURN OF PLAN OF CLASS AND. ALUMINUM CANS AND BOTTLESAS A REDEMPTION FEE. THERE'S ALSO REDEMPTION FEE OF CA CONSUMER TAKES A MATTRESS TO ONE OF THE ONE HUNDRED SIXTY DROP OFF SITES THAT YOU DO GET A REDEMPTION FEE. I APOLOGIZE MISTER ACOSTA MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I DON'T KNOW. AND MAYBE THE DEPARTMENT KNOWS I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE ACTUAL RATE IS TODAY IF IT'S TWO OR THREE DOLLARS. FOUR DOLLARS IT'S THE DEPARTMENT IS TELLING ME THAT IT'S THREE DOLLARS. SO THAT THE ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION IS WHEN THE CONSUMER TAKES A MATTRESS AND THERE'S ACTUALLY A THREE DOLLAR REBATE THAT THEY GET. THAT'S A MATTER FOR THEM TO DO THAT. OKAY THANK YOU AWFULLY LA AWFULLY LARGE ITEM FOR FOR THREE DOLLARS BUT THE AYE AYE AYE HE. I THINK YOU KNOW I'M NOT GOING TO COLLECT THE MONEY. I COLLECT THEM FOR OTHER REASONS BEEN UP FOR THE THREE DOLLARS WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR RESPONSE. ALRIGHT ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SAYING NOT ARE THERE ANY PUBLIC COMMENTS ON THIS THE. AUDIT REQUESTS. SEEING NO ONE RUSSIAN FORWARD THIS REQUEST I I AGREE WITH THE SENATOR ALLEN AND. ASSEMBLY MEMBER COSTA THAT YOU KNOW THE IDEAL SITUATION WE LIKE TO. SEE EVERYONE. IN THE. BUILDING TO. TRY TO SEEK INFORMATION THROUGH INFORMAL MEANS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE IT SOUNDS LIKE. THERE IS SOME FRUSTRATION ENCOUNTERED BY MS GARCIA AND HER STAFF IN TERMS OF GETTING. OF HER INFORMATION. AND THERE'S A QUESTION AT LEAST AS TO. HOW COOPERATIVE MRC WAS AND TELL THERE ARE FACED WITH THE PROSPECT OF THE AUDIT BUT I THINK? UP FOR FIRST AND FOREMOST SAID THE REASON WHY I RECOMMEND THIS AUDIT IS BECAUSE. INODE AND THIS IS A. GOT A NEW PROGRAM WHERE WE'RE DEALING WITH A PRIVATE ENTITY THAT IS COLLECTING GO OUT FUNDS ON BEHALF. OF. OF THEIR OWN THAT THAT THE STATE MANDATE. PASSED THROUGH LEGISLATION FOR THIS MATTRESS RECYCLING PROGRAM AND I THINK THERE IS VALUE TO HAVE. THE INDEPENDENT STATE AUDITOR TO GIVE A AN OFFICIAL SUSPECT AS TO. THE. STATUS OF OF THE PROGRAM US SO THAT WE CAN. EXCISE ARE PROPER OVERSIGHT AUTHORITY. AND SO WITH THAT I RECOMMEND AND AYE VOTE FOR THE REQUEST. MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. ROLL CALL TO APPROVE AUDIT REQUEST NUMBER TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN ONE OF SEVEN ASSEMBLY MEMBER MERCI CHAU. MERCI CHI AYE ACOSTA AYE AYE ACOSTA AYE BAKER. BAKER I SANTIAGO. OBERNOLTE. OBERNOLTE I RUBIO. RUBIO I WEIGHED. WOULD I. SENATOR ROBB. ROTH AYE ALLEN. ALLEN I SPELL. CANNELLA. FULLER. FULLER AYE LARA. LARA I. THE MOTION PASSES. IF. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE SENATOR IS YOU'RE GOING TO BE STARTING A FLOOR SESSION AT. SHORTLY. OKAY. BUT YEAH. YOUR VICE CHAIR IS AN INDICATOR THAT THE YOUR PREFERENCE IS. FOR THE COMMITTED TO KEEP ROLLING BOARD AND SO. I WILL RESPECT THAT. SO ON NEXT IN LINE IS ASSEMBLY MEMBER LEVINE AS THE SOMEONE WERE LIVING STILL HERE. I. MISTER LIVING HAVE SIGNED IN BEFORE MISSED LACKEY BUT GIVEN THAT HE IS NOT HERE. WE WILL PROCEED WITH MR LACK. A LOT. WELL. TURNING EQUIPMENT LEFT. ALRIGHT WELCOME ASSURE LACKEY THIS IS. ON THE REGULAR CALENDAR ITEM NUMBER THREE. I REQUEST TWENTY EIGHTEEN DASH ONE OH FIVE LOS ANGELES POLICE DEPARTMENT. CRIME REPORTING STATISTICS REQUEST SUBMITTED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER LACKEY. WELCOME SIR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS AND APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO. PRESENT MY PROPOSED AUDIT FOR THE LOS ANGELES POLICE DEPARTMENT CRIME REPORTING STATISTICS. SPECIFICALLY THIS AUDIT WOULD REVIEW AND ASSESS A SAMPLE OF VIOLENT CRIME REPORTS. STORED IN THE LAPD DATABASE FOR THE PURPOSE OF IDENTIFYING CASES. BUT A BEEN MISCLASSIFIED AS LESS SERIOUS OFFENSES OR HAVE BEEN UNDER COUNTED. BACK IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN LA. CHIEF. CHARLIE BACK PUBLICLY ACKNOWLEDGE PROBLEMS WITH THE DEPARTMENTS PROCESS. FOR RECORDING CRIMES AND LAUNCHED A SERIES OF. CHANGED. I'M SORRY CHANGES AIMED AT. IMPROVING INTERNAL ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRAINING OFFICERS. AND THE TRAINING OPTIONS RECEIVE ON HOW TO CLASSIFY CRIMES. FOLLOWING THE LOS ANGELES TIMES INVESTIGATION A TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN NOT A BY THE OFFICE. BUT THE INSPECTOR GENERAL FOUND THAT'S A QUOTE UNQUOTE SIGNIFICANT NUMBER. OF CRIMES WERE CATEGORIZED A SIMPLE ASSAULT FROM TWO THOUSAND EIGHT TO TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN. AND THAT THEY WERE ACTUALLY AGGRAVATED ASSAULTS AND SHOULD HAVE BEEN INCLUDED AS PART OF THE VIOLENT CRIME STATISTICS THAT ARE SUBMITTED TO THE FBI AND DISCLOSE TO THE PUBLIC. AT THE CRIMES HAVE BEEN CLASSIFIED CORRECTLY DURING THOSE SEVEN YEARS THE RATE OF AGGRAVATED ASSAULTS WOULD HAVE BEEN AN AVERAGE OF THIRTY SIX PERCENT HIGHER EACH YEAR. IN NOVEMBER OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AN ADDITIONAL CLAIM OF ERRORS IN THE LAPD'S CRIME STATISTICS WAS REPORTED IN BOTH THE LOS ANGELES TIMES AND THE DAILY NEWS. LOS ANGELES POLICE DEPARTMENT PROTECTIVELY EVEN RELEASED A STATEMENT ARGUING THAT THESE ALLEGATIONS SHOULD BE TAKING. TAKEN I'M SORRY VERY SERIOUSLY. LOS ANGELES IS THE MOST POPULOUS CITY IN THE STATE. ANY ERRORS MADE AND THE REPORTING CRIME STATISTICS CAN SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT THE STATE'S CRIME CALIFORNIA REPORT. AND THEREFORE IS NOT JUST A LOCAL PROBLEM. THE CITIZENS OF LOS ANGELES IN THE REST OF THE STATE NEED TO HAVE CONFIDENCE IN THE ACCURACY OF REPORTED CRIME DATA. WITH THE RECENT PASSAGE OF REALIGNMENT AND VOTER APPROVAL OF PROP 47-57 THE PUBLIC DESERVES AN ACCURATE PORTRAYAL OF THE RESULTS WE'RE EXPERIENCING WITHIN OUR COMMUNITIES. IF YOU. YOU VERY MUCH MUCH LACKEY. MICHELLE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AS AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER LACKEY INDICATED THIS WOULD BE AN AUDIT OF LA UP POLICE DEPARTMENT AND LOOKING AT THEIR CRIME REPORTING. STARTING WITH LOOKING AT POLICIES PROCEDURES WHAT TYPE OF STANDARDS HAVE THEY ESTABLISHED WHAT TYPE OF TRAINING DO THEY PROVIDE NOT ONLY FOR THEIR OFFICERS FOR INDIVIDUAL OR FOR INDIVIDUALS. ARE IN PUTTING THE INFORMATION INTO THE DATABASE HE'S ASKED US TO LOOK AT A SAMPLE OR A SELECTION OF. OFFICER REPORTS AND DETERMINING ESSENTIALLY THE ACCURACY OF THE ANNUAL REPORTING OF THAT'S OCCURRING IDENTIFYING ANY SIGNIFICANT VARIANCE IS OP PERHAPS BY TYPE OF CRIME HE'S ASKING US TO DETERMINE WHETHER THERE ARE CERTAIN CRIMES. THAT MAY HAVE A HIGHER. INCIDENCE OF BEING MIS REPORTED ARE UNDER REPORTED A PARTICULARLY AS HE INDICATED I LOOKED AT THE INSPECTOR GENERAL'S REPORT FOR THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT I LOOKED AT SOME OTHER INFORMATION. AND IT YEAH MUCH OF THE UNDER REPORTING THAT HAS. BEEN IDENTIFIED AS RELATED TO ASSAULT WHETHER IT'S A SIMPLE ASSAULT AGGRAVATED ASSAULTS WE WOULD CERTAINLY BE LOOKING AT DIFFERENT TYPES OF OUR CRIMES TO DETERMINE WHETHER CERTAIN CRIMES THAT ARE. UNDER REPORTED MORE FREQUENTLY THAN OTHERS OUT ONE BIG OBJECTIVE HE'S ASKING US TO ACCOMPLISH IS LOOKING AT A SELECTION OF CRIMES BUT OVER A TEN YEAR WINDOW. OUGHT TO DETERMINE WHETHER THEY CRIMES WERE MISCLASSIFIED AGAIN HAS THERE BEEN AN INCREASE HAS THERE BEEN A DECREASE AGAIN WHAT TYPES OF CRIMES ARE BEING MISREPORTED. AND THEN FINALLY LOOKING UP THE STEPS THAT THE POLICE DEPARTMENT HAS TAKEN TO TRY TO MITIGATE OR MINIMIZE THE NUMBER OF CRIMES THAT ARE. MISCLASSIFIED OR MIS REPORTED UP AGAIN LOOKING AT SOME THE BACKGROUND INFORMATION IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THE POLICE DEPARTMENT HAS ESTABLISHED A DATA INTEGRITY UNIT WE CERTAINLY WOULD BE INTERESTED IN UNDERSTANDING WHAT THAT UNIT DOES. ARE AND HOW THEY CAPTURE THE INFORMATION IF NECESSARY WOULD USE OUR IT FOLKS TO ASSIST WITH THAT. THIS AUDIT THE BUDGET TWENTY SEVEN HUNDRED HOURS THE REASON EVEN THOUGH IT'S ONLY ONE ENTITY WERE VISITING. HOW WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO LOOK AT POLICIES PROCEDURES BUT LOOKING AT A TEN YEAR WINDOW AND MAKING SURE WE TAKE? A SIGNIFICANT OUR SAMPLE SIZE TO BE ABLE TO REALLY UNDERSTAND UP THE TRENDS OVER THAT TEN YEAR WINDOW WHETHER OR NOT CRIMES HAVE BEEN MISSED PORTED WHAT TYPES OF CRIMES IT CETERA. AN AUDIT OF THAT SIZE WILL TAKE US ABOUT SEVEN MONTHS TO COMPLETE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER LACKEY DO YOU HAVE ANY WITNESSES SO DO TO TEST FUND SUPPORT OF YOUR REQUEST I DO NOT MORE. GOOD MORNING. FORTY MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS R. F. ALI KHAN I AM THE DIRECTOR OF CONSTITUTIONAL POLICING POLICY FOR THE LOS ANGELES POLICE DEPARTMENT. SEATED WITH ME IS COMMANDER JEFFREY BURKE WHO THE COMMANDING OFFICER OF RISK MANAGEMENT LEGAL AFFAIRS GROUP. ON BEHALF WHICH CHARLIE BACK IN THE AND MEHRGARH CITY WANT TO THANK YOU FOR GIVING US THE OPPORTUNITY. TO RESPOND TO THE REQUEST FOR AN AUDIT THAT WAS. THAT THERE WAS SENT TO US LAST WEEK ODD. ONE OF MY RESPONSIBILITIES AS THE DIRECTOR CONSTITUTIONAL POLICING POLICY IS TO ENSURE THAT THE. OF REFORMS THAT WERE IMPLEMENTED DURING OUR CONSENT DECREE WHICH INCLUDE COMPLIANCE AND INTERNAL ADITING AND ALSO COORDINATING EXTERNAL AUDITS IN REVIEWS ARE FULLY COMPLIED WITH. BASED ON THE REQUEST THAT WE'VE SEEN. AND. OUR UNIQUE ROLE AND A IN AMONG LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES WHEN IT COMES TO YOU SEE ARE REPORTING. A IT'S THE CHIEF IN THE DEPARTMENT'S POSITION AND THE MAYOR OF LOS ANGELES POSITION TO OPPOSE THE AUDIT REQUEST. I AS I MENTIONED WE HAVE A UNIQUE ROLE IN LEADERSHIP WHICH IS ALSO BEEN RECOGNISED BY THE FBI IN THE LETTER THAT I THINK WAS REACHED JUST CIRCULATED TO YOU. ARE ON OUR. CLASSIFICATION OF USE YOUR CRIME REPORTS OUR DATA TRANSPARENCY IN THE ROBUST SYSTEMS FOR ACCURATELY CLASSIFYING OVER THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND CRIME REPORTS A YEAR. A IS SECOND TO NONE AND ESPECIALLY WHEN DEALING WITH THE COMPLEX AN OUTDATED SYSTEM SUCH AS THE FBI UNIFORM CRIME REPORTS IT WAS INDICATED THAT THE AUDITOR WOULD LOOK OVER A TEN YEAR PERIOD. THAT WOULD CONSIST OF APPROXIMATELY THREE MILLION OF REPORTABLE CRIMES. ENDED IN ADDITION IT WOULD BE HALF A MILLION AGGRAVATED ASSAULTS ALONE OBVIOUSLY THAT WOULD BE A SAMPLING OF THOSE BUT IN ORDER TO HAVE. A RANDOMIZED STRATIFIED SAMPLING AND ALSO THE EXPERTISE TO REVIEW THAT WOULD TAKE A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF TIME. I UNDERSTAND THIS AUDIT REQUEST WAS PROMPTED BY A NOVEMBER TWENTY SEVENTEEN DAILY TIMES ARTICLE REGARDING THE LAWSUIT FILED BY DIVISION COMMANDER. AND REFERENCING A TWO THOUSAND AND FOURTEEN STORY ABOUT A REVIEW OF LAPD DATA AND REPORTS THAT WERE PROVIDED TO THE LA TIMES OUT THROUGH PUBLIC RECORDS ACT REQUEST. AND SEVERAL MEETINGS THAT I PARTICIPATED IN IN THEIR REVIEW AND ANALYSIS OF OUR REPORTS AND WHAT THEY DISCOVERED IS THERE WAS AN ERROR RATE. THAT IS NOT SURPRISING. THEIR ERRORS IN THIS INHERENTLY. VAGUE SYSTEM WHICH IS WHY THE FBI IS TRANSITIONING TO AN ENTIRELY NEW SYSTEM IN THREE YEARS. BUT MUCH HAS CHANGED E. EVEN THOUGH OF THESE ERRORS WERE FOUND. SINCE THEN THE LAST THREE AND A HALF YEARS UP WE HAVE DEDICATED FIFTEEN FULL THAI POLICE OFFICER DETECTIVE AND CIVILIANS WHOSE SOLE JOB IS TO ENSURE THE INTEGRITY OF OUR DATA. IN CRIME REPORTING HOBBIES ARE FIFTEEN PERSONNEL WHO ARE NOT ON THE STREETS INVESTIGATING CRIMES THEY'RE NOT DOING ANY CRIMINAL RELATED MATTERS BECAUSE WE COULD THE CHIEF OF POLICE IS DEDICATED TO MAKE SURE. THAT THEY'RE PROVIDING THE SPECIALIZED TRAINING OF WHICH WE HAVE DONE A FIVE HOUR COURSE FOR TWO THOUSAND OFFICERS. SINCE TWENTY FOURTEEN DEVELOP UNIQUE TOOL SUCH AS DECISION TREES CHECK WITH THE HELP DESK BULLETINS AND NOTICES AND THEN ALSO IMPLEMENTED INTERNAL QUALITY CONTROL MEASURES INCLUDING INTERNAL INSPECTIONS. WHICH INCLUDED REVIEWING FIVE THOUSAND AGGRAVATED ASSAULT REPORTS LAST YEAR MISTER ALCOTT I I KNOW YOU YOU PROBABLY HAVE A LOT TO SAY BETTER JUST TO BE FAIR TO ALL WITNESSES IF YOU. TRY TO WRAP UP AND WE CAN BRING OUT MORE INFORMATION THROUGH THE QUESTION PERIOD ABSOLUTELY UP TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE'S ANY CONCERN ABOUT IT EXTERNAL REVIEW I THINK WHAT'S IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND THAT WHAT IS ALSO UNIQUE ABOUT THE LAPD IS WE HAVE A FIVE PERSON CIVILIAN. OVERSIGHT COMMISSION KNOWN AS THE BOARD POLICE COMMISSIONERS THAT HIRES THE FULL TIME. INSPECTOR GENERAL WITH A FULLY US STAFF. THEY HAVE AUDITED AND THEY REVIEW ALL OF OUR AUDITS AND THEY HAVE FOUND THAT THE THAT THE THINGS THAT WE'VE IMPLEMENTED HAD AN IMMEDIATE EFFECT ON REDUCING OUR ERROR RATES IN THIS VERY COMPLICATED AREA. AND WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU COMMANDER IS YOU HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL JUST TO ADD UP WHEN WE DISCUSS ERROR RATE. ADDS THE LA TIMES A NOTED IN NOVEMBER THAT THEY WERE CONCERNED. THAT SOMETIMES OUR AIR RATE IS TEN PERCENT THIS IS THE. SAME REFERENCE THAT WE SAID IN OUR REPORT TO THE INSPECTOR GENERAL OWN INTERNAL AUDITORS AND MARCH. TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AND AGAIN IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN WHERE WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE HAVE OVER THE PAST TEN YEARS AN ERROR RATE OF ABOUT TEN PERCENT. INTERNING SPECTER GENERAL'S REPORT IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN NOTED THAT AFTER LOOKING AT THREE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED A AGGRAVATED ASSAULTS NOTED AN ERROR RATE AND THEY LOOK AT A SEVEN YEAR PERIOD. OF APPROXIMATELY NINE PERCENT OF OUR MOST RECENT AUDIT HAS SHOWN US THAT WE HAVE CHANGED OUR AIR RAID A THAT TO US SIX PERCENT IN AGGRAVATED ASSAULT AERATE AND SIMPLE SOFTWARE PERCENT. ALRIGHT THANK YOU. DO WE HAVE. QUESTIONS FROM THE OUT OF IN THE COMMITTEE MISS ETCETERA. EXCUSE ME. SO. IN TERMS OF WHAT LEAD UP TO THIS AUDIT REQUEST HEAD. HAS THERE BEEN ANY EVIDENCE OR HAVE YOU UNCOVERED ANY EVIDENCE OR IS ANYONE PRESENTED YOU WITH ANY EVIDENCE TO INDICATE THAT THIS MISS CLASSIFICATION WAS THE RESULT. OF INTENTIONAL CONDUCT OR MISCONDUCT ON THE PART OF ANYONE. INSIDE THE. LAPD ORGANIZATION. THAT'S CERTAINLY NOT THE ALLEGATION THAT I'M TRYING TO TO PRESENT FORWARD IS THAT THERE'S ANY INTENTIONAL. MISCONDUCT OR MANIPULATION HOWEVER I THINK WE LIVE IN AN ENVIRONMENT RIGHT NOW WITH THE PUBLIC TRUST WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS ERODED SIGNIFICANTLY. AND I WOULD LIKE TO BUILD THAT BACK IF THERE ARE. A SUSTAINABLE CIRCUMSTANCES AND THERE IS AN ERROR RATE THAT CAN BE EXPLAINED THAT IT SHOULD BE DONE SO THROUGH AN INDEPENDENT AUDITOR. AND THAT'S WHAT THAT'S MY GOAL IS TO TRY TO BUILD PUBLIC TRUST BACK IT'S NOT TO LA. TWO ALLEGED THERE'S MISTRUST. WELL IT SOUNDS LIKE THE DEPARTMENT MEAN THIS IS A AN ERROR RATE IT'S. BARELY BEEN ESTABLISHED ON SEVERAL DIFFERENT OCCASIONS BY SEVERAL DIFFERENT METHODS NOT. YET BY THE STATE AUDITOR. AND IT SOUNDS LIKE THE DEPARTMENT RECOGNIZES IT AND IT SOUNDS LIKE THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION IS DEVELOPING A NEW SYSTEM THAT LAPD WILL UTILIZE WHICH HOPEFULLY WILL REDUCE THEM NUMBER OF MISS CLASSIFICATIONS. AND IF IN FACT THAT'S THE CASE AND I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT'S CASE BUT THAT'S WHAT'S BEEN PRESENTED. THEN I'M CONCERNED OF FOR GOING TO SPEND THREE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS JUST TO HAVE OUR STATE OUGHT TO GO AND VERIFY THAT THE OTHER RATE IN FACT IS NINE OR TEN PERCENT. FOR MISS CLASSIFICATIONS. AND IT'S NOT THE RESULT OF ANY INTENTIONAL MISCONDUCT OR OR INTENTIONAL ACT ON THE PART OF LAPD OR THE MAYOR ANYBODY ELSE IN THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES TO. TO ARTIFICIALLY LOWER. IT COULD A CRIME RATE IN THE CITY THEN I DON'T KNOW WHERE WE ARE AT THE END OF THE AUDIT ARE WE WHERE WE ARE TODAY WHICH IS WE KNOW THERE'S A NINE OR TEN PERCENT. MISS CLASSIFICATION RATE AND DEPARTMENT AND FBI FIGURED OUT TRY TO GET LOWER BUT THAT PROPOSAL. ASSUMES A LOT OF ASSUMPTIONS THAT. MAY NOT BE FACTUAL AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE LIKE THE OUTSIDE AUDITOR TO COME INTO VERIFY. THEIR THERE VERY WELL MAY BE SUBMITS AND SOME ACTUAL INTENTIONAL AND MANIPULATION OF NUMBERS BECAUSE THAT'S THE SUSPICION OF MANY IN THE PUBLIC. AND THE PUBLIC POLICY THAT WE CRAFT. FROM THE PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE AND AS LEGISLATURE CULTURALLY STATISTICS AND SO THE STATISTICS ARE VERY VERY IMPACTFUL ON THIS ENTIRE STATE. SO WE HAVE MISREPRESENTATION OF FACTS TO THE DEGREE I MEAN THEY INDICATE A THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND. THAT'S A LOT LOT OF SALADA CRIMES AND WHEN WE HAVE EVEN AT A TEMPER SENT RATE. OF THAT'S THAT COULD BE A CRAFTED DOWN TO FIVE OR FOUR PERCENT. THEN WE NEED TO BE DOING THAT VERY THING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE MAKING HONEST DECISIONS BASED ON HONEST INFORMATION WE DON'T GO TO MY QUESTIONS IS BEING CRITICAL I MEAN I I THINK. SORT OF A. OF A BIPARTISAN QUESTIONER WHEN IT COMES TO BEING IN HERE WHETHER IT'S AN AUDIT COMING FROM THE LEFT OR NOT COMING FROM THE RIGHT AYE I TEND TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT. AND I USE THE TERM FISHING EXPEDITION AND THAT SHOULDN'T BE. CONSIDER TO BE A CRITICISM IT'S NOT BUT I TEND TO BE A LITTLE CONCERNED WHEN WE SEND OUR STATE AUDITOR OUT ON A. ON A MISSION WHERE THERE IS NO EVIDENCE TO INDICATE. A PROBABLE CAUSE FOR EXAMPLE FOR THOSE YOU IN LAW ENFORCEMENT THAT SOMETHING MAY HAVE OCCURRED. THAT'S THE REASON FOR MY QUESTIONING BUT I WON'T BELABOR IT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR INDULGING ME THANK YOU SIR FOR BRINGING THIS FOR. THE BANK ABOUT IT SURE OBERNOLTE AND THEN MS BAKER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR YOU KNOW QUITE OFTEN IN THE LEGISLATIVE AUDIT COMMITTEE WILL RUN INTO SITUATIONS WHERE. THE REQUEST FOR AN AUDIT IS PERCEIVED AS ADVERSARIAL. AND A DOESN'T SEEM TO ME THAT IN THIS CASE IT IS I THINK THAT WE'RE ALL THE SAME TEAM HERE WERE TRY TO REDUCE THE ERROR RATES OF THE CLASSIFICATION OF THESE CRIMES. ARE BUT IN READING THE DEPARTMENT'S RESPONSE IT SEEMS LIKE THERE'S A PERCEPTION THAT THE CONFIDENCE OF THE DEPARTMENT'S BEING CALLED INTO QUESTION AND I CERTAINLY DON'T. DON'T ENTER PREDICT THAT WAY. MY QUESTION IS THIS IF. THE ASSISTANCE OF THE STATE AUDITOR WOULD PA WOULD BE HELPFUL IN ESTABLISHING PROCEDURES THAT REDUCE THE AIR RAID I THINK THAT EVERYONE WOULD BENEFIT. ANSWER MY QUESTION USE IS WOULD. THE AUDITOR BE OF ASSISTANCE IN THAT RESPECT AND IF NOT THEN WHY NOT. IT'S OUR POSITION THAT THE ART IT WOULD BE OF LITTLE OR NO VALUE TO US IN THE REASON FOR THAT IS THAT WE ALREADY HAVE EXTERNAL AUDITS THAT ARE CONDUCTED BY THE OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL. OLIVER INTERNAL AUDITS ARE PUBLICLY PRESENTED AND HAVE BEEN FOR MANY YEARS SO IT'S BEEN NO SECRET THAT WE'VE HAD PREVIOUS ERROR RATES. OLIVER PROCESSES AND PROCEDURES THAT WE'VE IMPLEMENTED SINCE TWENTY FOURTEEN HAVE BEEN PRESENTED PUBLICLY TO OUR OVERSIGHT COMMISSION MULTIPLE TIMES. WE HAVE ASKED THE FBI UP FOR MORE GUIDANCE ON WHAT IS AN ACCEPTABLE ERROR RATE THOSE TYPES OF THINGS AND WE'VE BEEN FULLY OPEN AND TRANSPARENT WITH OUR PROCESSES AND PROCEDURES. I'M I THINK OF WHAT WAS MENTIONED EARLIER UP BY THE VICE CHAIR IS TRUE WE EXPECT THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE FOUND AN ERROR RATE. TO THE EXTENT THERE'S ANY AN ALLEGATION OF ANY INTENTIONAL MANIPULATION WHICH I'M NOT AWARE OF ANY BUT WHEN THESE THINGS HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP IN THE PAST THE DEPARTMENT CONDUCTED A VERY THOROUGH. INTERNAL INVESTIGATION MARIE HAD THE A POWER AND ABILITY TO COMPEL. OFFICERS TO SPEAK AND DETECTIVES AND THERE WAS NOTHING FAILED TO SHOW INTENTIONAL MANIPULATION OR THE ANY PARTICULAR ALLEGATIONS TO THAT THAT ARE PENDING THAT I'M AWARE OF. SO SOMEBODY COMING IN AND AND IF EXPENDING THAT THOSE RESOURCES CERTAINLY THERE MIGHT BE SOMETHING BUT. GIVEN OUR OPENNESS OR TRANSPARENCY THE AMOUNT OF RESOURCES THAT WE SPEND CURRENTLY I I WOULD NOT EXPECT TO FIND ANYTHING THAT WOULD CERTAINLY BE. LIKELY TO REDUCE OUR RATE FROM. SIX PERCENT TO TWO OF WE'RE CONSTANTLY DRIVING TO DO THAT THAT IS SOMETHING IS VERY PORTANT. THERE HAVE NOT BEEN ANY MISREPRESENTATIONS OF OUR CRIME STATISTICS WE HAVE ALWAYS INDICATED THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE AN ERROR RATE AND WHAT WE'RE REPRESENT WHICH IS. FAIRLY KNOWN THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY I THINK WHAT WE WOULD WOULD BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO DO IS IF THERE IS AN INTEREST IN LOOKING AT OUR. UP PROCESSES ARE PROCEDURES ALL OF OUR INTERNAL THE EXTERNAL AUDITS AND UNDERSTANDING OF OF THAT. WERE MORE THAN HAPPY TO DO THAT AS WE DO IT FREQUENTLY WE WERE ONLY TOLD OF THIS INTEREST IN DOING AN AUDIT LAST WEEK. AND SO WE'VE BEEN SORT OF IN A POSITION WHERE WE'RE NOW. TRYING TO SHOW THE MANY MANY THINGS THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING SINCE THE ORIGINAL REPORT. WAS PUBLISHED IN TWENTY FOURTEEN WELL JUST TO BE CLEAR EYED NOTHING IN REQUEST I READ SUGGESTS THAT ANY OF THE. ERRORS IN REPORTING ARE INTENTIONAL. BUT TO THE EXTENT THAT. WE AT THE STATE LEVEL CAN BE OF ASSISTANCE TO YOU AND FINDING OUT PATHWAYS FOR REDUCING THE ERROR RATE I'M I'M I THINK WE'RE WE'RE ALL MOTIVATED GIVE YOU THAT ASSISTANCE. SO I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR ANSWERING THE QUESTION THANK YOU. THANK YOU MS BAKER THAN MR ACOSTA THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I I THINK I AM. MR OF THE NINETIES COMMENT JUST CORRECT FOR SURE THAT THIS DOESN'T APPEAR TO ME TO BE AN ADVERSARIAL WINE OR WHINE WHERE. THE AUTHOR IS. JUST LOOKING FOR SOMETHING TO AUDIT I THINK I WENT WHEN I LEARNED OF THIS AUDIT REQUEST AND SAW SOME OF THE BACK WHEN I THOUGHT AS A STATE LEGISLATOR I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO HAVE THIS INFORMATION% BECAUSE. LA IS THIS LARGEST CITY AND CALIFORNIA AND WEIGHS IN ON LEGISLATION THAT WE ARE VOTING ON LAST SESSION THE SESSION AND OTHERWISE. I DO WANT TO ASK OUR AUDITOR. THINK TWO QUESTIONS. IF IF THE THE SCOPE OF THE AUDITED AS AS YOU UNDERSTAND IT WILL ALLOW YOU TO FIND OUT. INCLUDE BY LOOKING EVER TENURE PERIOD WHAT OF THE ITEMS THAT HAVE BEEN CHANGED HAVE BEEN EFFECTIVE I LIKE A CAUSAL LINK BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE REALLY HELPFUL WHEN I'M READING IN THE RESPONSES AND OTHERWISE IF CHANGING THINGS AND OUR ERROR RATE IS BETTER. WE HEAR A LOT IS OF LEGISLATORS THAT THERE'S PROGRAMS OUT THERE AND THERE FOR THE ENTIRE ENTITY HAS IMPROVED SOME RATE OF. RETURN OR SOME RATE OF EFFECTIVENESS BUT THEY CAN'T DRAW A LINE BETWEEN HERE'S WHAT WE DID HERE AND THIS IS WHY IT WAS EFFECTIVE. I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THAT DOES THIS AUDIT GIVE YOU THE CAPABILITY OF DOING THAT. YES IT DOES THERE ARE SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES THAT. MISTER LACKEY HAS ASKED US TO LOOK AT STEPS THAT LAPD HAS TAKEN TO REDUCE OR MITIGATE AND AS I MENTIONED IN LOOKING AT SOME OF THE BACKGROUND MATERIAL OVER THE WEEKEND THEY. THE LAPD SHERIFF I MEAN I'M. CHECK CHIEF BACK I APOLOGIZE CHIEF BACK ACTUALLY IMPLEMENTED A DATA INTEGRITY UNIT I THINK IT'S REFERRED TO SO WE WOULD WANT TO LOOK AT THAT AS PERHAPS. A BEST PRACTICE THAT LAPD IS USING WHEN DID THAT UNIT ONE WAS AT UNICREDIT AND WHAT'S THE DISK DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HOW MUCH WAS MIS REPORTED ARE UNDER REPORTED PRIOR TO. AND NOW SUBSEQUENT AS AS A GENTLEMAN INDICATED THERE ARE SPECIFIC INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE WORKING ON REVIEWING REPORTS TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE. APPROPRIATELY CLASSIFIED AND ENTERED INTO THE SYSTEM SO I THINK. IF THEY'RE DEPENDING ON WHEN SOME OF THOSE MEASURES WERE TAKEN WE CAN LOOK AT THE BEFORE AND AFTER AND I THINK THAT'S WHY MISTER LACKEY. ASKED US TO LOOK AT A TEN YEAR WINDOW I THINK THAT'S GOOD BECAUSE THAT THAT TO ME. IS WHAT WE GET AT THE END OF THE LINE IS A LITTLE BIT MORE EITHER KOZOL. AYE CONNECTION OR SO THAT WE CAN BE MAKING BETTER DECISIONS THAT WILL AFFECT THE STATE BECAUSE AT THE STATE LEVEL WE'RE HEARING FROM LOS ANGELES THE POLICIES THAT. ARE IMPLEMENTED AT THE STATE LEVEL ARE FACT IN THE AREA AND OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE. AND AND I ALSO WANT TO. ASK THE OTHER AUDITS THAT HAVE BEEN MENTIONED THE INSPECTOR GENERAL OTHERWISE YOU WILL HAVE THE BENEFIT OF THOSE AS PART OF YOUR. WORK I THINK IN YOUR OPENING TESTIMONY YOU MENTIONED THAT I'VE LOOKED AT SOME OF THEM AND AND SO I'M. IT THAT BECOMES NOT DUPLICATIVE BUT THAT CAN BE USEFUL TO YOU AND HAVING THAT INFORMATION ALREADY OUT THERE. ABSOLUTELY AND IN PREPARATION FOR THE HEARING I ALWAYS I HAVE MULTIPLE BACKGROUND BINDERS THAT STAFF PREPARE FOR ME SO I CAN BE OKAY A LITTLE BETTER UP TO SPEED. FOR THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS LIKE THAT SO YES ABSOLUTELY WE WOULD LOOK AT INSPECTOR GENERAL REPORTS ANY INTERNAL AUDITS THAT HAVE BEEN DONE AND UNDER OUR AUDIT STANDARDS THAT MY OFFICE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR FOLLOWING OBVIOUS STATUTE. A GENERALLY ACCEPTED AUDITING STANDARDS WE ARE REQUIRED TO LOOK AT OTHER WORK IT'S ALREADY BEEN DONE SO THAT WE CAN BENEFIT FROM THAT DETERMINE WHETHER WE CAN RELY ON IT AND NOT DUPLICATE WORK THAT'S ALREADY BEEN DONE. I WAS VERY INTERESTED IN SEEING THE INSPECTOR GENERAL REPORT THAT WAS DONE ON THE LA SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT HOW THEY WENT ABOUT SELECTING THEIR SAMPLE WHAT THE SIZE WAS WHAT KINDS OF QUESTIONS THEY ASKED. BY THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT AS FAR AS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION SO I THINK WE WOULD WE WOULD START BY LOOKING AT WHAT'S ALREADY BEEN DONE LEARN FROM THAT AND DETERMINE HOW THAT WILL AFFECT OUR APPROACH. IN CONDUCTING THIS AUDIT IF THE COMMITTEE DECIDES TO PROVE IT WAS GOOD TO HEAR AYE I DO YOU SEE AN END PRODUCT THAT CAN BE HELPFUL TO US. STATE LEGISLATORS AND HOPEFULLY HELP HELPFUL ADDED TO THE LA BROADER AREA AND IT BRINGS AND AN ADDITIONAL ELEMENT OF INDEPENDENCE THAT GIVEN THE ALLEGATIONS WHETHER IT WAS. IN TWENTY FOURTEEN OR. LAST YEAR I'M IS REALLY REALLY NEEDED AND AND CAN BE VERY BENEFICIAL SO I'M LOOK FOR TO SUPPORT THE I THINK YOU MISTER LACKEY FOR BRINGING FORWARD. MR BECAUSE IT WOULD. THANK YOU A LOT OF MY COMMENTS A VERY BEEN ECHOED BY MY BY MY. THE FELLOW MEMBERS HERE. I DID ONE I I GUESS AT THIS POINT SINCE THEY HAVE BEEN I WANNA MAKE A COMMENT AYE AYE. SOMEONE WHO REPRESENTS LOS ANGELES. AND AS A LOT OF. ADMIRATION FOR YOU KNOW FOR THE LAPD. I LOOK AT THIS AS AGAIN NOT ADVERSARIAL I LOOK AT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT CAN SUPPLEMENT THE RESOURCES THAT THE LAPD IN INTERNAL AUDITS HAVE. I LOOK AT THIS AS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR EVERYONE TO BE ON THE SAME PAGE IN TERMS OF THEIR. YOU KNOW POLICIES AND PROCEDURES BUT ALSO TO JUST YA CAN'T HAVE A BACKSTOP. IT IT CERTAINLY A TIME GOING TO SPEND. THE STATE RESOURCES HE SHOULD HAVE A A THE POSITIVE OUTCOME IN TERMS OF. YOU KNOW WHAT KIND OF INFORMATION THAT WERE WERE SEEKING AND ONE WHAT THE END GOAL AS. A BUT I LOOK AT THE BACKDROP OF WHAT I HEAR IN THE DISTRICT IN FROM MY CONSTITUENTS OF. YOU KNOW THAT JUST THAT THE OVERALL CRIME RATE AS SOME OF THAT VIOLENT CRIMES AND THEY'RE VERY CONCERNED A WITHOUT NOT ONLY THE. THE REPORTING BUT ALSO JUST THE RESOURCES AND I THINK THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY THAT COULD BE. POSITIVE A POSITIVE OUTCOME I LOOK AT THAT FABULOUS WORKED AT THE. THE OFFICERS ARE DOING ON THE STREETS AND AND FRANKLY I THINK A COMMAND STAFF IS IS DOING. EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO WORK AND IN AND FRANKLY IT TOUGH SITUATION THIS LEGISLATURE'S MADE IT VERY VERY CHALLENGING FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. ACROSS THE STATE WITH A PROP FORTY SEVEN AND EIGHT ENDEAVOR TO MAYBE ONE A NINE AND OF COURSE PROP 47-57 THAT THE. THAT THE ARM VOTERS HAVE APPROVED IT'S MADE IT MUCH MORE DIFFICULT FOR THESE POLICE AGENCIES AND SO I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE THE RESOURCES THEY NEED IN THIS IS ANOTHER WAY FOR US TO GET THE INFORMATION THAT WE NEED IS A LEGISLATURE. TO TO HAVE THAT THE PROPER ON. PERSPECTIVE ON WHAT'S HAPPENING AND AND I I HOPE IT'S NOT EVER CONSTRUED AS ANY KIND OF OUR. OF AN INDICTMENT OF WHAT'S HAPPENING YA INTERNALLY A CERTAINLY. YOU KNOW WITHOUT OF THE RANK AND FILE OFFICERS ON THE STREET THEY'RE DOING A FABULOUS JOB I WORK WITH THEM YOU KNOW ON A REGULAR BASIS. AND FRANKLY ANNA A WHOLE LOT OF LIVE IN MY DISTRICT AND I AYE INTERACT WITH THEM REGULARLY AND AYE HERE ISSUES THAT I THINK. WE YOU KNOW WE CAN WE CAN HELP ADDRESS A NOT NECESSARILY THROUGH THIS AUDIT PROCESS BECAUSE THIS IS A KIND OF A SEPARATE ISSUE. BUT CERTAINLY. THE AUDIT WILL GIVE US AN OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE A BASELINE THAT EVERYONE IN THE STATE CAN NOW TAKE A LOOK AT AND SAY WELL HERE'S SOME BEST PRACTICES HERE SOME THINGS THAT THAT WERE YOU KNOW THAT WERE DONE VERY WELL BY LAPD AND I'M SURE THAT'S GOING TO BE. THE CASE. AND AND ALSO IF WE HAVE AN AFFIRMATION THAT IT'S A FOUR PERCENT TO SIX PERCENT OR TWENTY PERCENT. ERROR RATE WHATEVER IT HAPPENS TO BE. WORK ON AND NOW HAVE THE FACTS AND I I WAS ONE AIR ON THE SIDE OF HAVING DATA. O. EVERYWHERE I I SAID IN THIS LEGISLATURE WHATEVER BODY AND WHATEVER COMMITTEE IT'S ON I LIKE TO HAVE THE DATA AND I THINK THIS IS ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO DO THAT. BUT CERTAINLY AT A WITH ALL RESPECT AND ADMIRATION FOR OF THE LAPD I THINK THIS IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR. YOU KNOW FOR US TO BE ABLE TO GET THE INFORMATION AND I THINK YOU OFFER YOU KNOW YOU'RE BRING IT FORWARD THANK YOU TO THE AUTHOR'S NAME ONLY BRIEFLY. CLARIFY A POINT THAT THE HON THAT WAS JUST MADE UP FIRST WELL WE DO NOT SEE THIS AS ADVERSARIAL AS WELL. I OVERSEE OUR OWN INTERNAL AUDIT THE VISION I UNDERSTAND THAT THE AUDITING IS DIFFICULT AND CHALLENGING SO WE DO NOT I THINK OUR CONCERN IS THAT THERE WAS NO DISCUSSION WITH US TO EXPLAIN WHAT THE CIRCUMSTANCES ARE. I THINK THERE'S SOME MISPERCEPTIONS FOR EXAMPLE WHAT WAS INDICATED THAT THE CONCERN ABOUT THE THE RELATIVE CRIME RATE AN ERROR RATE DOESN'T AFFECT THE RELATIVE CRIME RATE IF THE ERROR RATE IS RELATIVELY CONSISTENT OVER TIME. THE RELATIVE INCREASE OR DECREASE IN CRIME DOES NOT MATTER IF YOU HAVE A FIVE TEN PERCENT ERROR RATE YEAR TO YEAR AND THAT IS SOMETHING THE INDEPENDENT INSPECTOR GENERAL HAS FOUND SO ARCTIC CRIME RATE REDUCTIONS THAT INCREASES. ARE NOT AFFECTED BY THAT ERROR RATE OF THE SECOND THING IS THAT. WE DO NOT USE FBI CLASSIFICATIONS TO TO DEPLOY RESOURCES SO HOW WE CLASSIFY A CRIME UNDER THE UC OUR SYSTEM HAS NO IMPACT ON HOW WE ALLOCATE RESOURCES TO SHOOTINGS AND OTHER THINGS BECAUSE. THE FBI SYSTEM OF REPORTING DOES NOT MARY OUR MATCH UP THE CALIFORNIA PENAL CODE IN ANY WAY. SO THIS IS A WHOLE DIFFERENT REPORTING SYSTEM THAT'S THERE AND I THINK OUR CONCERN IS COULD WE GET SOME VALUE OF THIS CERTAINLY. BUT GIVEN THE EXPENSE THAT WILL BE. EXPENDED BY THE STATE WE JUST FEEL WILL BE HIGHLY DUPLICATIVE OF WHAT WE DO IN A VERY OPEN AND TRANSPARENT MANNER WITH THE. AUDIT DIVISION THAT'S KNOWN THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. DOES EVERYTHING BY THE GENERALLY ACCEPTED GOVERNMENT AUDITING STANDARDS AND THEN THE INDEPENDENT INSPECTOR GENERAL THAT COMES IN AND WE DO AUDITS ANNUALLY A CRIME STATISTICS. THE INSPECTOR GENERAL VIEWS THAT THE INSPECTOR GENERAL CONDUCT ITS OWN AUDITS THAT ARE ARE COMPLETELY SEPARATE FROM US. AS WELL AS ALL OF OUR DATA ALL OF OUR REPORTS A PUBLICLY AVAILABLE AND UNDER INTENSE SCRUTINY BY RESEARCHERS AND THE MEDIA EXTERNALLY. SO OUR CONCERN IS THAT THIS IS SIMPLY GOING TO BE DUPLICATIVE OF A LOT OF THOSE EFFORTS AND WE'RE MORE THAN HAPPY TO TAKE THE TIME. IF GIVEN THE TIME TO PRESENT ALL OF THE MANY THINGS THAT WE'VE DONE AND IMPROVED OVER THE LAST OF SEVERAL YEARS. RIGHT. AND QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. ANY PUBLIC COMMENTS ANYONE IN THE AUDIENCE. SEEING NONE. IT'S LACKEY WHICH LIKE CLOSE. YEAH I JUST REAL QUICKLY I JUST WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT I AM SYMPATHETIC TO THE HESITATION FOR. OF THE DEPARTMENT OF THE LOS ANGELES POLICE DEPARTMENT TO A WELCOME AN AUDIT. AND CERTAINLY. I UNDERSTAND THAT THEY HAVE CONSENT DECREES TO COMPLY WITH AND THEY HAVE A LOT OF. OVERSIGHT CIRCUMSTANCES TO YOU THAT. THERE IS A PROTECT THE REASON WHY WE BROUGHT THIS FORWARD AT BECAUSE THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT. LEVEL OF DOUBT THAT HAS BEEN A PERMEATED IN THE MINDS OF MANY POLICY MAKERS AND MANY PEOPLE WHO RELY ON. ON THE TRUST AND LAW ENFORCEMENT AND AND. BUT TYPICALLY LOS ANGELES POLICE DEPARTMENT. AND AS A OF THE VICE CHAIR OF THE PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE WE RELY. ON GOOD STATISTICAL INFORMATION TO MAKE GOOD PUBLIC POLICY. AND THERE IS CLEARLY A RESERVE WHAT I WOULD CONSIDER A REASONABLE DOUBT OTHERWISE I WOULDN'T BE HERE. I'M I GET NO SATISFACTION OUT OF BRINGING. THIS KIND OF CHALLENGE FORWARD TO IT AT A DEPARTMENT THAT I HAVE GREAT ADMIRATION FOR HAVING SERVED TWENTY YEARS A LOT FOR SOME MYSELF. SO THERE IN MY OPINION AND THE REASON WHY WE'RE. DISCUSSING THIS ISSUE TODAY IS THERE IS A REASONABLE DOUBT. IN THAT IN THE MINDS OF MANY THAT I THINK THAT THIS AUDIT WOULD BE ABLE. TO BRING FORWARD AND TO ELIMINATE AND I THINK IT'S VERY CRITICAL THAT WE ELIMINATE THAT. THAT LEVEL OF DOUBT THAT'S BEEN PERMEATING FOR A LONG TIME QUITE HONESTLY. AND I I DON'T A. WANT TO TO CREATE IT DID A CIRCUMSTANCE THAT I HAVE ANYTHING TO GAIN FROM THIS OTHER THAN GOOD INFORMATION THAT THE PUBLIC. DESERVES AND WE TRULY NEED RIGHT NOW WHERE WHEN THE LEVEL OF LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS. THE A DISTRUST OF THEY DO AND THAT'S IN ARGUABLE THAT WE NEED TO BUILD OUR OUR PUBLIC CONFIDENCE NOT LEAVE IT THIS. PARTICULAR A PROPOSAL AND THIS AUDIT WOULD BUILDUP PUBLIC TRUST NO MATTER WHAT THE FLIGHT. SO THEREFORE I WOULD ASK THAT YOU A FAVORABLY CONSIDER THIS AUDIT. RIGHT. THANK YOU MISTER LACKEY. MOTIONS BEEN MADE TO AND. BY MISTER OBERNOLTE AND SECONDED BY MS BAKER. SO ARM I I DID HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO. STUDY THIS REQUEST. AND A LITTLE MORE DETAIL AND I ALSO HAD A CHANCE TO. AND FOR THE RECORD DISCUSS. THIS WITH THE LAPD CHIEF A BACK. YESTERDAY EVENING WHO. THIS THAT THE POINT I FOCUSED ON WAS WHETHER THERE ARE TO ANY INDEPENDENT AND AND RECENT. REVIEW OF. THE CRIME STATISTICS AND. THE CHIEF. APPOINTED ME TO THE ARE OF COURSE THE INSPECTOR GENERAL'S REPORT WHICH HAVE A COPY HERE.

CRIME STATISTICS AND AND AND CRIME TRENDS. BUT I FEEL AT THIS POINT AND THAT THIS IS. PERHAPS. PREMATURE THAT THAT PERHAPS WE SHOULD ALLOW THE RECENT REFORMS. TO TO GO FORWARD. THE EFFORTS OF THE LAPD ARE SUPPORTED BY. THE FBI WE HAVE. A LETTER HERE. CHIEF BACK REQUESTING TO A JAMES COMEY OF THE F. B. I. THEN DIRECTOR OF THE FBI. IT WITH A RESPONSE. FROM.

CENTRE BELL WHICH LIKE STIRRED. MISTER CHAIRMAN I'M A MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT THIS TODAY. AS I STATED IN OUR AUDIT REQUEST LETTER I'M HERE TODAY REQUESTED JOINT LEGISLATIVE AUDIT COMMITTEE. TO APPROVE AN AUDIT TO EXAMINE. THE EFFICIENCY IN OF A FAT DE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY OF CALIFORNIA. AND THE CURRENT POLICIES AND PRACTICES IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE PROJECT. NOT WITHOUT A QUESTION THE HIGH SPEED RAIL PROGRAM IS THE LARGEST MOST COMPLEX AND. SOME WAYS FAR REACHING PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT WE HAVE NOT ONLY CALIFORNIA BUT IN THE NATION. THIS MEGA PROJECT PUTS CALIFORNIA AT THE FOREFRONT OF THE TRANSPORTATION INNOVATION. HOWEVER PROJECT THIS LARGEST NOT COME WITHOUT CHALLENGES. THE HIGH SPEED RAIL. PROJECT CONSTANTLY FACES A MAIREAD OF REGULATORY ENVIRONMENTAL PUBLIC POLICY POLITICAL FUNDING AND OTHER CHALLENGES THAT MUST BE ANTICIPATED. AND EFFECTIVELY MANAGED AND IN ORDER TO OF HAVE A PROGRAM THAT SUCCESSFULLY IS DELIVERED ON TIME AND ON BUDGET. THE AUDIT RICK THIS AUDIT REQUESTS AM SAID TO PROVIDE THE INDEPENDENT REVIEW. OF THE AUTHORITIES EXISTING PRACTICES AND PROCEDURES. THE RESULT FROM THE AUDIT WILL PROVIDE THAT MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE. WITH THE NECESSARY INFORMATION TO ALLOW US TO PROVIDE STRONG OVERSIGHT AND GUIDANCE TO ENSURE THE PROJECT IS ON TRACK TO BE SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED. FOR EXAMPLE IN THIS REQUEST WE ARE REQUESTING THE STATE OUGHT TO REVIEW THE CONTRACT MANAGEMENT POLICIES. AND PRACTICES INCLUDING THE PROCESS FOR APPROVING CONTRACTOR CHANGE ORDERS. WHEN I WAS BOARD OF A CHAIR. OF THE SANTA CLARA COUNTY TRAFFIC AUTHORITY. WHICH IS THEIR FIRST HALF CENT SALES TAX IN CALIFORNIA. OUR AND WE BUILT. MANY MILES OF FREEWAYS. I CONSTANTLY CHALLENGED CONTRACTORS IN JUSTIFYING THEIR CHANGE ORDER REQUEST AS THEY COULD LEAD TO SIGNIFICANT COST OVERRUNS. THIS IS WHY IT'S CRITICAL THAT WE LOOK AT BOTH THE HIGH SPEED RAILS CONTRACT MANAGEMENT POLICIES AND. ALSO HOLD THE CONTRACTORS. ACCOUNTABLE IN ENOUGH TO EFFECTIVELY USE THE TAXPAYERS' MONEY BY MINIMIZING CHANGE ORDERS INTERN. KEEPING PROJECT COSTS INCREASE TO MINIMUM. BOTH HOUSES ARE AWARE THAT THIS IS A VERY CRITICAL YEAR FOR THE HIGH SPEED RAIL. TODAY I'M HERE REPRESENTING AN AUDIT REQUESTS UNDERSTAND THE ASSEMBLY HAS ALSO EXPRESSED SOME CONCERNS. ON THE AUTHORITIES REQUEST TO DELAY THE RELEASED OF THIS YEAR'S BUSINESS PLAN AS SET A LETTER TO THE AUTHORITY. NOW AUTUMN I IT'S MY GOAL AS CHAIRMAN OF THE TRANSPORTATION HOUSING COMMITTEE OF THE SENATE. TO PROVIDE A STRONG OVERSIGHT OVER THE AUTHORITY AND PROJECT AT THE SAME TIME. INSURER THE AUTHORITY HAS THE PROPER POLICIES AND PROCEDURES IN PLACE. TO ALLOW THE PROJECT TO SUCCESSFULLY MOVED FORWARD. THANK YOU AND WE HAVE MY COSTA RESULT TURN IT OVER TO MICHAEL OFFERS A SEMI MEMBERS. SENATE TOP. MEMBERS APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO JOIN WITH MY COLLEAGUES IN PRESENTING OUT. THE MORE WE LEARN ABOUT. THE HIGH SPEED RAIL PROJECT THE MORE WE ARE FACED WITHOUT THE NECESSITY AND THE NEED FOR OF A FORENSIC THOROUGH. A AT AN INDEPENDENT AUDIT WE'VE WE'VE LEARNED FOR EXAMPLE THAT. WE'RE ON EIGHT YEAR ALMOST AN EIGHT YEAR DELAY. WE HAVE SEEN EXECUTIVES DEPARTING. AND IT'S TAKEN A PERIOD OF TIME TO FILL THOSE. EXECUTIVE POSITIONS IN A IN A TIME WHEN THE PROJECT IS IN A VERY CRITICAL PERIOD OF TIME. NOW WE'VE LEARNED ALSO THAT THE AUTHORITY HAS MADE EMERGENCY INTERNAL FUND TRANSFERS FROM MY UTILITY ACCOUNTS TO THE CONSTRUCTION ACCOUNTS. IN ORDER TO KEEP OUR ARE THE HARD HATS ARE WORKING IN CENTRAL CALIFORNIA. AND THAT JUST A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO WE FOUND OUT THAT THE INITIAL OPERATING SEGMENT. HAS JUMPED FROM SIX BILLION DOLLARS TO EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS NOW TO ALMOST ELEVEN BILLION DOLLARS THESE ARE. FACTS AND TRAJECTORIES DATA CALL HOME. BECAUSE ALL OF US TO HAVE SOME REAL. CONCERNS. MANY OF YOU COME FROM UP LOCAL GOVERNMENT EITHER AS MAYOR OR CITY COUNCIL OR BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. AND IF YOU WERE TO SEE THESE KINDS OF SCIENCE AND AN INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT IN YOUR BACKYARD WERE YOU RESPONSIBLE FOR OVERSIGHT. YOU REALLY WOULD SEE THESE AS REAL RED MARK SIGNALS THAT AND ARE INDEPENDENT NONPARTISAN AUDIT. THE AT TO FIND OUT WHAT'S GOING ON IS REALLY IMPORTANT AND AND MEMBERS WHIT WE'RE REALLY WAY PAST THE POLITICS OF ALL OF THIS. REALLY DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU THINK THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY IS DOING A GOOD JOB WITH THE THE. RARE HIGH SPIRITS GOOD IDEA BAD IDEA OR IF YOU'RE CAUGHT MIDDLE. AND UNDECIDED THE SET OF FACTS AND CONCERNS THAT WE ARE RAISING THAT COME OUT RECENTLY POINT SQUARELY TO THE NEED TO APPROVE THIS AUDIT TODAY. AND WE RESPECTFULLY ASK THAT YOU APPROVE IT THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER PATTERSON MISTER OPERABLE. SO FIRST THANK YOU TO MY COLLEAGUES FOR JOINING ME IN THIS AUDIT. I'M HERE TODAY TO SUPPORT THE AUDIT REQUEST OF THE HIGH SPEED RAIL. AS ONE OF THE TWO MEMBERS APPOINTED AS AN EX OFFICIO MEMBER OF THE BOARD I WOULD LIKE TO ASK YOUR SUPPORT FOR THIS AUDIT. WE KNOW THAT MANY OF THE FINANCIAL OVERRUNS HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY DELAYS IN ACCESSING LAND AND DELAYS FROM LITIGATION. THIS AUDIT SHED SOME LIGHT ON HOW WE IMPROVE DELIVERY OF THE PROJECT MOVING FORWARD MORE EFFICIENTLY. IN MY DISTRICT THE POSITIVE EFFECTS THAT HIGH SPEED RAIL IS ALREADY CREATING IS BEING FELT COUNTY WIDE. HIGH SPEED RAIL IS HAVING THE LARGEST IMPACT IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY WITH ONE POINT TWO BILLION OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITY. AND SIXTY EIGHT HUNDRED JOB YEARS OF EMPLOYMENT VALLEY ONE. HIGH SPEED RAIL HAS HAD THE LARGEST IMPACT IN FRESNO COUNTY. BETWEEN JULY FIFTEENTH AND JUNE TWENTY SIXTEEN HIGH SPEED RAIL RESULTED IN OVER THREE THOUSAND JOB YEARS OF EMPLOYMENT. AND ABOUT THIRTY PERCENT OF THE TOTAL JOBS THAT FRESNO COUNTY ECONOMY ADDED DURING THAT TIME. IN TWENTY FIFTEEN FRESNO'S UNEMPLOYMENT RATE DIPPED BELOW TEN PERCENT FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE THE RECESSION OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHT AND ONLY THE FOURTH TIME IN THE LAST TWENTY FIVE YEARS. THE COUNTY HAS EXPERIENCE THREE CONSECUTIVE YEARS OF ANNUAL EMPLOYMENT GROWTH OVER THREE PERCENT. PRIOR TO TWENTY FOURTEEN FRESNO COUNTY HAD JUST ONE YEAR OF THREE PERCENT EMPLOYMENT GROWTH SINCE NINETEEN NINETY. WITH ANY LARGE INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS THAT THERE ARE BOUND TO BE OVERRUNS. BUT TAXPAYER DOLLARS MUST BE SPENT RESPONSIBLY AND THIS AUDIT WILL HELP ENSURE THAT PROJECTS ARE BEING DELIVERED MORE EFFICIENTLY. THESE POSITIVE IMPACTS WILL BE FELT BY ALL COMMUNITIES ALONG THE HIGH SPEED RAIL ROUTE. ADDITIONAL TRANSPARENCY WILL ENSURE PUBLIC TRUST IN CALIFORNIA'S EFFORTS TO BUILD THE FIRST HIGH SPEED RAIL IN NORTH AMERICA. AS THE FRESNO BEE SAID THIS MORNING THE MORE INFORMATION WE GET THE BETTER. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MS HAL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AS MEMBERS INDICATED A OBVIOUSLY THIS IS NOT OF HIGH SPEED RAIL REALLY FOCUSING ON. CONTRACT MANAGEMENT FIRST OBJECTIVE IS LOOKING AT POT THE THIRTIES POLICIES PROCEDURES AND PROCESSES FOR MANAGING CONTRACTS AWARDING CONTRACTS MANAGING THOSE CONTRACTS AND DOING THINGS TO CONTAIN COSTS. BOB BY TRACKING OUR CONTRACTS REVIEWING INVOICES AND ULTIMATELY PAYING THOSE INVOICES AS SENATOR BELL INDICATED ONE KEY ISSUE HE IS ASKING US MEMBERS OF ARE ASKING US TO LOOK AT IS THE CHANGE ORDER PROCESS. THE FREQUENCY OF CHANGE ORDERS THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THOSE CHANGE ORDERS WHAT KIND OF PROCESS HAS THE AUTHORITY ESTABLISHED. OUGHT TO ADDRESS CHANGE ORDERS THROUGHOUT THE PROJECT. IN LOOKING AT THE ECONOMIC IMPACT WE'VE BEEN ASKED TO THE EXTENT WE CAN POSSIBLY DO THIS AND CERTAINLY WE WILL WE WILL LOOK TO SEE WHAT THE AUTHORITY HAS DONE AS FAR AS. EVALUATING THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF THE EFFORTS OF FOR CONSTRUCTING A HIGH SPEED RAIL IN CALIFORNIA AND WHAT THE IMPACT HAS BEEN ON COMMUNITIES PARTICULARLY THOSE COMMUNITIES RIGHT NOW IN CENTRAL VALLEY. WHERE THIS FIRST SEGMENT OUR FIRST PHASE OF THE PROJECT IS IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION? ALSO DETERMINING. CONTRACTING WITH SMALL AND DISADVANTAGED OR MICRO BUSINESSES THERE'S A THERE'S A PROVISION OF THAT THE AUTHORITY THEIR GOAL IS TO HAVE THIRTY PERCENT OF THEIR CONTRACTS TO BE WITH SMALL. DISADVANTAGED DISABLED VETERAN MICRO BUSINESSES SO WE WOULD ASSESS THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE AUTHORITIES BEEN ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH THAT GOAL. AND THEN THE LAST COUPLE OF OBJECTIVES ARE RELATED TO A SUSTAINABILITY POLICY LOOKING AT BOTH. ECONOMIC OUT OUR OUTCOMES BUT ALSO ENVIRONMENTAL WHAT ARE SOME OF THE EXPECTED AYE ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS OF HAVING HIGH SPEED RAIL IN CALIFORNIA. AND HOW IS THE AUTHORITY ASSESSING THOSE BENEFITS AND COMMUNICATING THOSE BENEFITS AND THEN THE LAST OBJECTIVE. DIDN'T TO THE EXTENT WE CAN AGAIN WE WILL CERTAINLY LOOK TO SEE WHAT THE AUTHORITY IS DOING AS FAR AS THEIR EFFORTS. TO TRY TO PARTNER WITH OTHER TRANSPORTATION. I'M ENTITIES ARE TRANSIT OR RAIL LINES TO TRY TO EXPEDITE A COMPLETION OF THE PROJECT IN CALIFORNIA THEIR BUDGET FOR THE PROJECT OR FOR THE AUDIT IS TWENTY SIX HUNDRED HOURS THAT THAT WOULD TAKE US. BETWEEN SIX AND SEVEN MONTHS PUBLIC CLOSER TO SEVEN MONTHS I'M WE MAY NEED TO HIRE A CONSULTANT WITH RESPECT TO THIS ADMIN ECONOMIST PERHAPS A MAYBE SOME CONSTRUCTION EXPERTISE WE HAVEN'T MADE THAT DETERMINATION BUT I WANT TO LET THE COMMITTEE KNOW THAT AS WELL. OUT WE ALWAYS. LOOKED TO FOR ASSISTANCE IN THE EVENT PARTICULARLY A HIGH PROFILE VERY IMPORTANT PROJECT LIKE HIGH SPEED RAIL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU VERY MUCH ARE THEIR WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF THIS REQUEST. SEEING NONE. DO WE HAVE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE CALIPHATE CALIFORNIA HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY. WELL I'M SORRY IN A VERY HERE ON BEHALF OF THE I I AM I REPRESENT IN A SMALL BUSINESS. OPAC MATERIALS WILL BE WERE AWARDED THE HAVE PURCHASE ORDER FOR THE READY MIX CONCRETE ON THE PROJECT. IN TWO THOUSAND AND THIRTEEN THROUGH TUTOR PERINI ZACHRY PARSONS WHO WAS AWARDED THE CONTRACT. TRACTOR I CONSTRUCTION PACKAGE ONE. AND. AT THE TIME WE HAD. FIVE OPERATIONS IN THE IN THE AN EASTER SIERRA'S MARIPOSA HARBURY SOME SMALL TOWNS. IN ASSEMBLY BIGELOW'S AREA. AND. HAD BEEN THERE FOR JUST OVER FORTY YEARS. AND WHEN WE HEARD THE NEWS ABOUT THE HIGH SPEED RAIL PROJECT IT WAS SOMETHING WE WANTED TO GET INVOLVED IN. AT THE TIME WE AT THIRTY TWO EMPLOYEES AND FAMILIES AND OUR PAYROLL WAS ABOUT A MILLION TO. THINK THE END OF THIS YEAR OUR PAYROLL WAS OVER SIX MILLION DOLLARS IN OUR EMPLOYEE AND COUNTLESS NINETY TWO PEOPLE. IN FAMILY SO THE EMPLOYMENT BROUGHT AS A RESULT OF THIS PROJECT TO TO OUR BUSINESS AND OTHER SMALL BUSINESSES THAT. FRANKLY I. SOME SORT OF OF MATERNAL THAT HAVE REPRESENT THEM OFFICIALLY BUT THERE IS A LOT OF SMALL BUSINESSES THAT I WORK WITH EVERY DAY THAT COULDN'T BE HERE. BECAUSE THEY DRIVE THEIR OWN TRUCKS ARE THERE ONE OR TWO MEN. OPERATIONS SO HOME. WE'VE HAD A HUGE IMPACT WE'VE INVESTED SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS IN. IN. NEW TRUCKS AND. AND A NEW CONCRETE PLANT WITH ALL THE NEW ENVIRONMENTAL. TECHNOLOGIES TO GO ALONG WITH THOSE THINGS HANDA A RECYCLING A HUNDRED PERCENT OF OUR WATER IN ALL OF OUR. CONCRETE FOR THE PROJECT KNOWN AS WELL WERE IMPLEMENTING A CLEAN TECHNOLOGY WERE REPLACING CEMENT WITH LIQUID CARBON DIOXIDE. INTO OUR MIXES THAT ALLOWS US TO USE CO TWO WASTIN PUT IT BACK INTO CONCRETE WHERE THE MATERIAL IS SEQUESTERED. ANDA ABLE TO REDUCE OUR CARBON FOOTPRINT AS A RESULT. OF THIS TECHNOLOGY AND BECAUSE WERE ABLE TO BUILD A NEW PLANT. A AS A RESULT THIS PROJECT WE PROVIDE CLEANER CONCRETE TEN LOWER CARBON EMISSIONS. TO. TO FRESNO. PLAYWRIGHT AND YOU MAY HAVE DONE THIS BUT GOOD YOU WERE. RESTATE YOUR NAME AND YOUR AFFILIATION FOR THE RECORD US LOVE IT IS MY NAME ON THE OWNER ABOUT BACK MATERIALS READY MIX CONCRETE COMPANY. PARA THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WELCOME SIR. ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY. THANK YOU ARE CHAIRMAN MARTUCCI. MEMBERS OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE MY NAME IS DAN RICHARD I'M THE CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE CALIFORNIA HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO APPEAR HERE TODAY. OB I JUST A MISTER CHAIRMAN I WITH YOUR INDULGENCE MAKE JUST A VERY FEW REMARKS AND CERTAINLY BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS FROM YOU OR THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE. ON A SENATOR BELL SAID JOB THE CALIFORNIA HIGH SPEED RAIL PROGRAM IS. IS THE NATION'S LARGEST INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAM OUT WE ARE VERY AWARE EVERY DAY THAT WE WERE THE STEWARDS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF PUBLIC FUNDS. THIS INCLUDES NOT ONLY THE. FEDERAL MONIES THAT CAME TO US THROUGH THE THE RIPPED THROUGH THE STIMULUS ACT BUT AT THIS POINT. WE'VE DRAWN DOWN SOME OF THE STATE BOND MONIES UNDER PROPOSITION ONE A. A AND. BECAUSE OF ACTIONS OF. THIS LEGISLATURE AT THE REQUEST OF THE GOVERNOR OUT WE HAVE ACCESS TO FUNDS UNDER THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM AND WORK SPENDING THOSE SO THERE ARE. PUBLIC DOLLARS INVOLVED HERE OF VERY LARGE MAGNITUDE AND WE RECOGNIZE OF THE OVERSIGHT RESPONSIBILITY. OF THIS BODY TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE DOLLARS ARE SPENT IN THE BEST POSSIBLE WAY TO ACCOMPLISH SHAUNA THE OBJECTIVES. AND AND SO I'M HERE TO SAY THAT A WE WILL BE FULLY COOPERATIVE. AS WE HAVE BEEN IN THE PAST WE WILL BE FULLY COOPERATIVE WITH THIS AUDIT REQUEST WE WILL NOT WORK WITH THE AUDITOR GENERAL'S OFFICE A. A AS OPENLY AND AS. AS EFFECTIVELY AS WE CAN. AND I'D LIKE TO JUST STEP OUT FOR A MOMENT JAM UNDERSCORE THAT POINT BY EMPHASIZING THREE THINGS. OP I WAS APPOINTED TO THIS POSITION IN TWENTY ELEVEN AND IN EARLY TWENTY TWELVE I BECAME. THE BOARD CHAIR ARE ABOUT TWO DAYS BEFORE I BECAME THE BOARD CHAIR. THOUGHT IT WAS REPORTED THAT. THE AUDITOR GENERAL WAS HIGHLY CRITICAL OF THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY BECAUSE. TWENTY TWO OR TWENTY THREE RECOMMENDATIONS HAVE BEEN MADE BY THE STATE AUDITOR HAD BID IGNORED COMPLETELY BY THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY FOR TWO YEARS. AND I I PLEDGE THAT AS SOON AS WE ARE TOOK OVER MY VERY FIRST ACT UPON IT A ASSUMING THE GAVEL WAS TO CREATE A FINANCE AND AUDIT COMMITTEE OF THE HIGH SPEED RAIL GOVERNING BOARD. ARE IN CHARGE OF THAT COMMITTEE IS THE RETIRED VICE CHAIRMAN OF BANK OF AMERICA. IT'S A VERY SERIOUS COMMITTEE OF THEIR WORK IS UP OPEN AND PUBLIC THEIR MEETINGS ARE OPEN IN PUBLIC AND THEIR DOCUMENTS ARE ON OUR WEBSITE. ARE I pOR FIVE MONTHS THAT ALL BUT ONE OF THOSE AUDITOR OUR RECOMMENDATIONS HAVE BEEN FULLY IMPLEMENTED BY THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY IN THE ONE THAT WAS AND IT WAS AGREED. WAS OUTSIDE OUR PURVIEW BECAUSE IT RELATED TO THE PEER REVIEW GROUP. A WE WERE VERY SERIOUS. IN HOW WE ADDRESS THAT. AND. TO THE EXTENT THAT THIS AUDIT. THE BOOK KILL WE WOULD HOPE THAT IT SHOWS THAT THERE PROCESSES AND PROCEDURES THAT WE'VE PUT IN PLACE ARE STRONG AND PROTECTIVE OF THE PUBLIC INTEREST. BUT WERE HUMAN BEINGS AND IF WE HAVE NOT BEEN PERFECT TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE ARE. DEFICIENCIES THAT ARE FOUND WEAKNESSES ARE AREAS THAT NEED IMPROVEMENT WE WILL IMMEDIATELY AN AGGRESSIVELY MOVE TO IMPLEMENT THOSE THAT IS MY PLEDGE TO YOU MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE AND HER COLLEAGUES. ACROSS THE LEGISLATURE. I DO WANT TO TELL YOU THAT. WE HAVE AN INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION. WE VERY ACTIVELY EVERY YEAR OUR AUDIT. ACROSS OUR ORGANIZATION UNDER OUR STRUCTURE WHICH I TRIED TO SET UP TO MIMIC ESSENTIALLY A CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE ABOUT AUDIT FUNCTION REPORTS NOT THROUGH OUR EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR BUT DIRECTLY TO THE BOARD. WHICH IS APPROPRIATE SO ARM. I'M. I ALSO WANT TO SAY THAT TIME ARE THERE BEEN OTHER AUDITS HAVE BEEN DONE EXTERNAL IN TWENTY THIRTEEN THE CONGRESS THE UNITED STATES DIRECTED AN AUDIT. THROUGH THE GOVERNMENTAL ACCOUNTABILITY OF OFFICE. THAT WAS AN EXTENSIVE AUDIT OF OUR COST ESTIMATION OF PRACTICES AND PROCEDURES AT THAT TIME. ARE AND I THINK I'M FAIRLY CHARACTERIZING IT TO SAY THAT OF THE GAO AUDIT AT THAT POINT AT THAT POINT. FOUND THAT ARE COST ESTIMATION PROCEDURES AND OTHER PROCEDURES WERE REASONABLE AND CONSISTENT WITH OUR FEDERAL BEST PRACTICES. HOWEVER. STARTING IN TWENTY FIFTEEN WE'VE BEEN AN EXTENSIVE CONSTRUCTION AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY. ARE THERE ABOUT THREE BILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF CONTRACTS UNDERWAY RIGHT NOW THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF BUSINESSES INVOLVED THERE ARE MAJOR CONTRACTORS THERE HAVE BEEN CHANGE ORDERS. THERE HAS BEEN COST GROWTH AND I'D AND I SAY SITTING HERE TODAY THAT I THINK THIS IS AN APPROPRIATE TIME. OFF OR THIS BODY TO OUGHT TAKE A SNAPSHOT LOOK AT. OUT HOW WE'RE DOING ON AND AS I SAID TO THE EXTENT WE'RE DOING WELL WILL BE PLEASED OUGHT TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE IMPROVEMENT. ARE YOU HAVE OUR COMMITMENT TO DO THAT. AS QUICKLY AND THOROUGHLY AS POSSIBLE. THINKING VERY MUCH. QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE STARTING WITH MISTER OBERNOLTE. BUT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN OF A QUESTION FOR MISS HOW. SO. WHEREIN THE VOTERS APPROVED PROPOSITION ONE AND TWO THOUSAND EIGHT ONE OF THE ASSURANCES THAT WAS GIVEN TO THEM WAS THAT THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY WOULD BE CAPABLE OF OPERATING LARGELY WITHOUT SUBSIDY ONCE IT HAD BEEN CONSTRUCTED. SO. A IN THE OUTLINE OF YOUR AUDIT YOU MENTIONED. EVALUATING DIFFERENT ECONOMIC OUTCOMES WITH THE AUTHORITY AND I'M WONDERING IF THE EVALUATION YOU KNOW WITH THE COST GROWTH THAT HAS OCCURRED IF IF EVALUATING WHETHER OR NOT THAT'S A REASONABLE ASSURANCE STILL IN OTHER WORDS IF THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY. WILL BE ABLE TO OPERATE WITHOUT OP TAXPAYER SUBSIDY WHENIT'S COMPLETE IF THAT'S PART OF THE SCOPE OF THE AUDIT THAT IS BEING PROPOSED. R. MISTER OBERNOLTE I WOULDN'T SEE THAT IN THE CURRENT SCOPE OF THE AUDIT WHEN WORK WHEN WERE CONSIDERING ECONOMIC IMPACT IT'S MORE AT MY PERSPECTIVE ARE END DOING THE ANALYSIS WOULD STAFF IS. LOOKING AT THE ECONOMIC THE POSITIVE HOPEFULLY IN MOST CASES ECONOMIC IMPACT OF THE COMMUNITIES WITHIN. THE CENTRAL VALLEY WHERE IT'S CURRENTLY BEING CONSTRUCTED AND AND CERTAINLY AND FUTURE PHASES OF ON HIGH SPEED RAIL SO WE WEREN'T NECESSARILY LOOKING AT WE HAVE LOOKED AT THAT IN THE PAST WHEN WE'VE LOOKED AT. THE BUSINESS PLAN FOR THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY THE FIRST AUDIT THAT WE DID OPT SEVERAL YEARS AGO NOW LOOKED AT THE BUSINESS PLAN AND LOOKED AT. FINANCING WHAT WERE THE EXPECTATIONS AS FAR AS FEDERAL MONEY COMING AND THE RIDERSHIP ARE HOW MUCH. THE FUNDING THAT WOULD BE GENERATED REVENUE GENERATED FROM RIDERSHIP WOULD HELP PAY FOR THE SYSTEM PARTICULAR MAINTENANCE OPERATIONS ONGOING I DON'T SEE THAT IN THE. CURRENT SCOPE AND OBJECTIVES THIS IS MORE ABOUT CONTRACT MANAGEMENT CHANGE ORDERS AND THEN. CONTRACTING WITH SMALL BUSINESSES THE BENEFITS THAT HAVE BEEN DERIVED FROM THAT NOT NECESSARILY WHETHER OR NOT. AND THE SYSTEM WILL BE. WILL NOT NEED SUBSIDIES FROM EITHER STATER OR FEDERAL. GOVERNMENT. OKAY FAULT BUT I'M NOT TRYING TO BE CYNICAL BUT IF IT SEEMS LIKE A SELF FULFILLING PROPHECY FOR ACT ASKING WHETHER OR NOT. A LARGE MATTER CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES CAN HAVE A POSITIVE ECONOMIC IMPACT ON COMMUNITIES THE HIGH SPEED RAIL GOES THROUGHOUT THAT THE ANSWER IS CLEARLY YES AND MAYBE QUITE QUANTIFY. HOW MUCH SO KNOW EVER I DON'T THINK I WOULD BE ALONE IN OPINING THAT IF WE'RE GOING TO UNDERTAKEN AUDIT? THEN LET'S BE THOROUGH AND LET'S AUDIT THE OVERALL IMPACT ECONOMICALLY ON CALIFORNIA AND I'D BE VERY ENTRUSTED IN. AN EVALUATION OF THE QUESTION OF WHETHER OR NOT HIGH SPEED RAIL WILL BE CAPABLE OF OPERATING WITHOUT TAXPAYER SUBSIDY WHEN IT'S COMPLETE. GIVEN THE RECENT COST OVERRUNS SO I COMEY SHIP THAT TO MISTER RICHARD. CAN YOU COMMENT ON THE THOSE ASSUMPTIONS AND THOSE ASSURANCES THAT WERE GIVEN AND WHETHER OR NOT THAT CONTINUES TO BE THE CASE HARM YES ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND I AM HAPPY TO DO THAT. A FIRST JOB. AS YOU NOTED THE BOND ACT A REQUIRES THAT. AND AND WE HAVE THIS CLEARLY IN MIND EVERY DAY THAT THE SYSTEM MUST BE SELF SUSTAINING AND OPERATE WITHOUT AN OPERATING SUBSIDY. AYE WILL POINT OUT. THAT DUMB OUT WE'RE IN THE PROCESS RIGHT NOW OF DEVELOPING OUR TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUSINESS PLAN WHICH IS TO BE DELIVERED TO THIS BODY THIS SPRING. ARE AND WE HAVE JUST WORKED WITH THE OUR LEADERSHIP IN THIS HOUSE OUGHT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE TIMING IN WHICH WE DELIVER THAT'S CONSISTENT WITH THE LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT. THAT BUSINESS PLAN MUST BY STATUTE ADDRESS THIS QUESTION THAT YOU'RE RAISING AND SO ON. WHETHER. THIS BODY DECIDES TO INCLUDE THAT IN THE AUDIT OR NOT. IS UP TO YOU BUT TO IT WILL BE BEFORE YOU IN THE FORM OF OUR BUSINESS PLAN AND ARE THERE ARE OUTSIDE PEER REVIEW EXPERTS TO LOOK AT THAT A QUESTION. AS PART OF THEIR ANALYSIS OF THE BUSINESS PLAN THEY'LL BE MAKING THEIR FINDINGS THAT THEY REPORT TO YOU BASICALLY UNDER THE STATUTE. AND SO ARE THERE WILL BE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT PATHWAYS I'M I'M NOT OBJECTING TO ANY ADDITIONAL PATHWAYS BECAUSE. IT GOES TO THE HEART OF THE QUESTION OF WHETHER OR NOT THE HIGH SPEED RAIL PROGRAM. IS ULTIMATELY BENEFICIAL FOR THE STATE IF IT CAN SELF SUSTAIN ITS OPERATION. THAT'S ALSO THE BASIS THAT YOU KNOW AS A BUSINESSMAN AS HOW WE WOULD RAISE PRIVATE SECTOR REVENUES BASED ON THE. THAT THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SO IT'S A FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION. AND WE SHOULD BE HAVING THAT CONVERSATION WITH YOU WHETHER IT'S THROUGH THE BUSINESS PLANNER THE AUDIT. IT IS UP TO YOU. WELL THANK YOU HAVE A VERY RESPONSIVE ARE. I WOULD URGE THIS BODY TO CONSIDER. INCLUDING THAT IN THE SCOPE OF THIS AUDIT AND I'M NOT OUT OF ANY DISTRUST NECESSARILY THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY BUT MORE OUT OF A DESIRE TO SEE AN INDEPENDENT SET OF EYES. CAST SOME LIGHT ON THIS ISSUE AND I THINK IF WE'RE GOING TO DO AN AUDIT LET'S DO A THOROUGH ON IT AND WHAT'S MAKE SURE THE WE PUT ALL OF THESE QUESTIONS TO BED. SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE ANSWER. THANK YOU MS. IS BAKER THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. TWO QUESTIONS IN THE COMMENT SO IN THE QUESTION FIRST ONE AND THEY'RE A FOR THE AUDITOR. IT FOLLOWS UP ON OUR COLLEAGUES COMMENTS ABOUT HOW THOROUGH THE OUT IT COULD BE BECAUSE WE REALLY. WANT TO MAKE SURE WE ARE NOT SETTING FORTH AN AUDIT THAT NOT ONLY HAS A FOREGONE CONCLUSION BUT JEN'S UP. ONLY ONE SIDE <u>. AND WITH</u> RESPECT TO THE ECONOMIC IMPACT THAT HIGH SPEED RAIL CAN HAVE A LOCAL COMMUNITY WHICH IS VERY IMPORTANT IN TELLING THAT IT'S IT'S HAVING A REAL IMPACT. DOES DUTY BOUND MODERATE DOES THE AUDITOR'S WRITTEN GIVE YOU THE ABILITY TO LOOK AT. NOT JUST THE ECONOMIC IMPACT IT'S HAVING BUT THOSE DOLLARS THAT ARE BEING SPENT ARE NOT BEING SPENT ELSEWHERE. SO WE NEED TO DO IS MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE SPENDING THE DOLLARS IN THE ABSOLUTE BEST WAY WE POSSIBLY CAN. AND AND GETTING THE BEST RETURN FOR TAXPAYER DOLLARS NOW. ARE I IN THAT SPIRIT OF ONE MAKE SURE IT'S A THOROUGH AUDIT. WONDER IF YOU HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY TO NOT JUST LOOK AT HERE'S HOW MANY JOBS HAVE BEEN CREATED HERE'S THE ECONOMIC ACTIVITY AS A RESULT OF HIGH SPEED RAIL. DO YOU HAVE ANY FLEXIBILITY OR FREEDOM OR. METHODOLOGY OR YOU COULD SAY AND HERE'S WHERE COULD HAVE BEEN SPENT FOR THIS WAS THE BEST WAY TO SPEND THOSE DOLLARS BECAUSE THAT'S EVEN MORE VALUABLE TO US AS A. AS A BODY. THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION. THAT AS I INDICATED. IN THE AND THE SCOPE IT WOULDN'T NECESSARILY BE CONTEMPLATED IN THE SCOPE OF THE OUGHT RIGHT NOW. CERTAINLY WE COULD LOOK AT THE SOURCE OF FUNDING FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE PROJECT AND AS MISTER RICHARDS INDICATED THERE SOME CAP AND TRADE MONEY. AND CERTAINLY THERE'S POLICY DECISIONS AS TO WHAT. CAPTAIN TRADE MONEY COULD BE USED FOR I THINK WHAT WE WOULD NEED TO BE ABLE TO DO IN THIS. AUDIT IS LOOK AT HOW THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY IS USING THE VARIOUS SOURCES OF FUNDING AND THE BENEFIT THAT'S BEING DERIVED FROM THAT I DON'T THINK WE COULD NECESSARILY. APPLYING OR MAKE A DETERMINATION WELL THAT MONEY WOULD HAVE BETTER BEEN BETTER SPENT FIXING ROADS OUR BRIDGES OR WHATEVER OR INVESTING IN SOME OTHER. POLICY AREA ON THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA I DON'T THINK. THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S CALLED FOR IN THIS PARTICULAR PROJECT BUT WE CERTAINLY CAN LOOK AT THE FUNDING THAT THE AUTHORITY IS USING AND HOW IS THAT MONEY BEING INVESTED IN CALIFORNIA AND IS THERE. AN ECONOMIC BENEFIT SHORT TERM AND CERTAINLY LONG TERM OKAY WHAT WOULD WOULD. A I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT I I ENCOURAGE US AS A BODY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CONSIDER THAT AS WELL. WHICH IS THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY COST FOR EVERY DOLLAR THAT IS SPENT AND YOU HAVE GOT A VERY LONG LIST OF OTHER TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS THAT WE COULD BE HAVING A GREAT RETURN ON THE DEPTH OF MOBILITY AND QUALITY OF LIFE FOR CALIFORNIANS. AND THOSE DOLLARS ARE GONNA GO TO HIGH SPEED RAIL. SO I THINK THAT'S A LENS THROUGH WHICH WE NEED TO DO THAT I WISH THEY OUGHT TO HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY TO PROVIDE YOU WITH THAT. ALSO ON THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS BECAUSE WE DO HEAR A LOT ABOUT HIGH SPEED RAIL HAVING THE POTENTIAL THESE FROM ITS ADVOCATES. TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTIONS A TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GASES AND YOU HAVE A POSITIVE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT. I'D LIKE YOU TO ADDRESS MORE HOW YOUR GOING TO BE EQUIPPED TO DETERMINES THAT THOSE. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS ARE REAL PARTICULAR WITH RESPECT TO GREENHOUSE GASES AND THAT IT IS HIGH SPEED RAIL. I THAT IS HAVING THAT POSITIVE IMPACT IF THERE IS ONE AND NOT OTHER. FACTORS THAT CAN WAY AND BECAUSE WE ARE AS A STATE RIGHTLY SO TACKLING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND I THINK AGGRESSIVELY WE NEED TO CONTINUE DOING THAT. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T ASCRIBE TO HIGH SPEED RAIL REDUCTIONS IN GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS THAT MAY HAVE HAD NO CAUSAL CONNECTION. CAN YOU ADDRESS THAT PLEASE CERTAINLY THERE'S AN OBJECTIVE IN THE AUDIT. ANALYSIS THAT TALKS ABOUT SUSTAINABILITY AND CERTAINLY LOOKING AT ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS AND THAT THE WAY TO THE OBJECTIVE RIGHT NOW IS CRAFTED IS TO START WITH THE AUTHORITIES EFFORTS TO EVALUATE TO WE WOULD HAVE TO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT. WE MAY NEED TO HIRE AN EXPERT TO ASSIST US IN THE* AND ALSO DETERMINING WHETHER OR NOT YOU CAN ISOLATE THEY ECONOMIC I MEAN THE ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS THAT HIGH SPEED RAIL WILL BRING TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. ARE YOU ABLE TO AS OR IS THE STATE OR THE AUTHORITY ABLE TO. ISOLATE THAT IMPACT AND IF THEY THEY'RE CLAIMING TO THEN HAVE SOMEONE ASSIST US IN DOING AN ANALYSIS THAT TO SEE WHETHER OR NOT THAT EVALUATION IS. REASONABLE OP I THINK THAT IS THE APPROACH THAT WE WOULD TAKE AT THIS POINT TIME. FOR THAT PARTICULAR OBJECTIVE OKAY BECAUSE I I I THINK THAT'S GONNA BE CRITICAL ON THAT FOR IN ORDER FOR THIS TO HAVE A RESULT AT THE END THAT IS USEFUL TO US. AND HERE'S HERE'S WHAT WE NEED TO DO FOR CALIFORNIA AND HERE'S THE POSITIVE IMPACT HAS IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT. YOU HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY TO DO THAT AND I ENCOURAGE IT. AND THAT THOSE OF THE TWO QUESTIONS BUT ALSO JUST THE COMET. EVERY RED FLAG YOU COULD POSSIBLY RAISE ABOUT A PUBLIC WORKS PROJECT. IS REYES WHEN IT COMES TO HIGH SPEED RAIL AND IT'S NOT THROUGH. A BAD ACTORS IT'S IT'S JUST A FACT WHETHER IT'S COST OVERRUNS CHANGE ORDERS IN THE COSTS THAT THEY'VE HAD FOR THE PROJECT. AND THE LITIGATION IMPACTS AND OTHERWISE SO I I'M PLEASED TO SEE A AND AUDIT THAT IS BEGINNING TO TACKLE THE SOME OF THAT. AND I JUST WANNA APPLY OUR COLLEAGUES FOR BRINGING. A UNIQUE BIPARTISANSHIP TO THIS REQUEST THAT WE DON'T OFTEN SEE WITH HIGH SPEED RAIL. IT'S ALARMING THE RED FLAGS THAT GET REYES WITH HIGH SPEED RAIL AND HOW MANY AUDITS HAVE DIED IN THIS COMMITTEE. AND EFFORTS IN THE LEGISLATURE TO ADDRESS THAT FAIRLY AND I REALLY APPLAUD OUR COLLEAGUES IN BRINGING A BI PARTISANSHIP I TO THIS I WILL LOOK FORWARD TO THIS. AUDIT AND HOPE THAT WE WILL MAKE GOOD DECISIONS BASED ON IT THANK YOU. THANK YOU BEFORE WE GO FORWARD TO LET ME REMIND THE COMMITTEE THAT WE DO HAVE A. COMMITTEE ROLE THAT. AT THE TIME THE HEARING IN AUDIT REQUEST MAY ONLY BE AMENDED IF THE AMENDMENT DOES NOT SUBSTANTIALLY AFFECT THE. FEASIBILITY SCOPE OR COST OF THE PROPOSED AUDIT. UNLESS. THE. REQUEST YOUR WISHES TO SUBSTANTIALLY AMANDA REQUEST. THAT REQUEST YOUR MAY ASK THE COMMITTEE TO HOLD THE REQUEST UNTIL THE NEXT COMMITTEE HEARING AND I SEE SANDRA BELL FROWNING THERE. CHAIRMAN. QUICK. BUT I. THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO UP TO RESPOND TO US. THE BI PARTISANSHIP HERE THE CONCERNS AND QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN RAISED. WHAT WE ARE ALL TRYING TO DO? IS TO GET PAST ALL OF THE NOISE TO GET PAST ALL OF THE POLITICS. TO GET DOWN INTO A THOROUGH AUDIT THAT IS GOING TO GIVE US A VERY GOOD HEADS UP. AS TO WHAT IS IT IS THAT'S WHAT IS COMING AND WHAT HAS. HAS HAPPENED. IN A BIPARTISAN WAY WE HAVE MADE AN UNDERSTANDING WITH ONE ANOTHER. AND WE WILL KEEP TO THAT UNDERSTANDING. HOWEVER I NEED TO POINT OUT THAT AS THE CHAIRMAN HAS MENTIONED AND. NOT TO PUT. WORDS IN HIS MOUTH AT ALL. THIS IS PROBABLY THE MOST SERIOUS PERIOD OF TIME FOR HIGH SPEED RAIL. THE AUDIT HELPS US GET THERE. I WILL BE LOOKING. GENUINELY FOR THIS BUSINESS PLAN WITH NEW LEADERSHIP. BECAUSE FOR ME THE BIG QUESTION HERE IS. WITH THE COST. EXPLODING. AND THE FINANCES FINITE. IS THERE ENOUGH MONEY. A COMPLETE FROM CENTRAL CALIFORNIA. I INTO THE SILICON VALLEY I I THINK THERE ARE SOME REAL QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT. AND SO YES THE AUDIT DOES HAVE SOME OF ADDRESS SOME OF THAT. BUT I DO LOOK FORWARD TO THE FACT THAT THERE WILL BE WITH NEW EXECUTIVES AND WITH NEW. A AT THE END OF A NEW LOOK. BY THOSE NEW EXECUTIVES. FOR THIS BUSINESS PLAN. MEMBERS WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A REAL OPPORTUNITY. TO TAKE A GOOD HARD LOOK AT THAT BUSINESS PLAN. AND I AM HOPING AND I BELIEVE. THAT THERE WILL BE A GOOD FAITH EFFORT. TO DEMONSTRATE WHETHER YOU CAN OR CANNOT GET INTO SAN JOSE. THIS IS FOR FOR CENTRAL CALIFORNIA WE HAVE A LOT AT STAKE HERE. A. BROTHER YOU'RE FOR IT OR AGAINST IT A YEAR AGO YOU'RE AT NONCOMMITTAL THE WORST THING THAT CAN POSSIBLY HAPPEN IS IF THE BUT IF WE WITH WE STARTED IN A FIELD OUTSIDE BAKERSFIELD AND ENDED. IN A FIELD OUTSIDE MERCED SO COMPLETION REALLY DOES BRING THE FULL FRUITS OF. OF WHAT WE A ARE ARE HEARING HERE FROM THIS BIPARTISAN GROUP SO I'M REALLY GOING TO LOOK FORWARD TO DIGGING IN I'M GONNA ASK MY COLLEAGUES AS WELL TO TAKE A GOOD. THE EFFORT WHEN WE HAVE THE CHANCE TO REVIEW THAT BUSINESS PLAN TO REALLY ASK THE QUESTION DOES THIS GET COMPLETED. WITH THE EXISTING FUNDS BECAUSE IF IT DOES NOT. THIS BODY AND. THE GOVERNOR AND OTHERS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO TAKE A GOOD HARD LOOK. AT WHETHER OR NOT ADDITIONAL MONEY IS GOING TO HAVE TO BE REQUESTED FROM THE PEOPLE CALIFORNIA. ALRIGHT THANK YOU MISTER. CENTER BALLOTS THIS IN RESPONSE TO OKAY I'D LIKE TO REMIND EVERYONE TO KEEP THEIR COMMENTS FOCUSED ON THE REQUEST A FOREIGN SO THOUSAND. I THINK THAT DAUM. THE BUSINESS PLAN. THE AUDIT ARE ALL INTERRELATED. THE AUDIT WILL DEAL WITH. JUST OF THE A QUICK. LOOK AT. THE EXISTING COST BENEFIT THE THE THE COST OF THE PROJECTS FOCUSING ON A PARTICULAR PROBLEM. OF OF EFFICIENCY AND BUILDING THE PROJECT ON TIME AND ON BUDGET. WE HAVE TO FOCUS THE AUTHORED ON THAT THAT'S WHY THE AUDIT WAS FOCUSED ON. BUILDING THE PROJECT ON TIME AND ON BUDGET. ONCE WE GET THE AUDIT. IT DOESN'T MEAN. THAT SAID. WE HAVE THE BUSINESS PLAN AND WE CAN SUBSEQUENTLY ASKED FOR ADDITIONAL RESEARCH AND AUDITS AND. OTHER STUDIES THAT. WILL THEN AFTER WE DO THIS THIS AUDIT. LOOK AT. A PROCESS THAT WE COULD SET UP IF WE WANT TO PUT IT THAT WAY. TO CONTINUOUSLY AUDIT AND GET RECOMMENDATIONS. FROM INDEPENDENT SOURCES. AS WE GO ALONG WITH THE PROJECT I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT TO OF THE ECONOMICS OF THIS. ATTENTION ALL IS IS IMMENSE. ARM. I REPRESENT SILICON VALLEY. SILICON VALLEY IS WATCHING THIS PROJECT. THEY WOULD LIKE TO LOCATE LE. OF HIGH TECH FACILITIES AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY. THEY SEE. HUGE ASSET. AND NAM AND I HATE TO SAY THIS BUT DOM. BEEN ASSEMBLY STATE STUDENT. OF FRESNO STATE HAS OF WONDERFUL OF SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING AND BUSINESS DEPARTMENT. AND I KNOW THAT WE CAN HAVE A BULLDOG SPARTAN ALLIANCE. WITH HIS PROJECT RIGHT. THE ARE AND WE WE WERE GOOD FRIENDS WEEK WAIT WE. WE LOVE THAT. RED. TIDE COMING TO SAN JOSE AREA EVERY OTHER YEAR. BUT. THERE IS A A SANERGY IN ECONOMICS. AND THE BUSINESS SENSE. OF CONNECTING SILICON VALLEY. WITH THE CENTRAL VALLEY. AND. THERE IS A POTENTIAL FOR. THE GROWTH OF THE ECONOMY THAT'S IMMENSE. AND. WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT APPLE AND. INTEL AND. ALL THE GREAT COMPANIES THAT WE HAVE IN SILICON VALLEY THERE IN MY DISTRICT. IT IS IT IS IT IS IT IS A POSSIBILITY. IT DOESN'T EXIST UNLESS THERE'S A TRUCK. EFFICIENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM. DOESN'T. IT HASN'T EXIST IN THE PAST I WON'T EXIST IN THE FUTURE. UNLESS WE HAVE IT ADEQUATE. EFFICIENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM. SO I THINK I THINK THE ECONOMY. ECONOMICS. OBVIOUSLY DRIVES RIDERSHIP. AND RIDERSHIP DRIVES THE OPERATIONAL. HIM IMPACT IN TERMS OF. COST PER RIDER AND IN TERMS OF. WHAT ARE NOT A SUBSIDY IS NEEDED GO? AND SO FORTH AND I THINK. TILL WE. SEE THE BUSINESS PLAN REFLECTING. SYMBOL SOME OF THESE ISSUES. THEY CAN CERTAINLY AYE I WOULD ASK THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY. AS OUR EX OFFICIO MEMBERS FROM THE LEGISLATURE. THAT THEY FOCUS ON BECAUSE THE COMMITTEE US THAT. HERE THAT THE BUSINESS PLAN MAYBE GIVE US SPECIAL ATTENTION MAYBE HAVE SOME INDEPENDENT REVIEW VERIFYING. THE OPERATIONAL ASPECTS AND SHARE IT WITH THE LEGISLATIVE MEMBERS DURING THE HEARINGS AT THEIR UP COMING IN A COUPLE MONTHS. BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT CHAU IT'LL PROBABLY BE A RANGE. NO BECAUSE A PROJECTS NOT TO BE COMPLETED FOR SEVERAL YEARS WE HAVE TO LOOK AT. THE FURTHER YOU GET OUT. THE IN TERMS OF FINISHING THE PROJECT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A RANGER GOING HAVE A. IT HAS NO IMPACT ON THE ECONOMY AND. THE BULLDOGS CAN'T COME TO SAN JOSE AND THE SAN JOSE CAN'T COME TO THE BULLDOGS. OF THAT COULD BE THE LOW END OF THE RANGE THE HIGH AND THE RANGE IS WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT IN TERMS OF THE POTENTIAL. FOR THE CONNECTION WITH SILICON VALLEY AND. THE. YOU KNOW JUST OF FRESNO CA SO WONDERFUL SCHOOL AND I GET IT I THINK THEIR ACADEMIC INSTITUTION WILL DRIVE THE. THE ATTRACTION. AND BAKERSFIELD STATE ALSO. I THINK THAT I THINK I JUST MENTIONED VEGAS FEEL SAFER CENTER FULLER MY FRIEND. BUT. BUT I THINK I THINK. I THINK BOTH BOTH SCHOOLS HAVE EXCELLENT ENGINEERING DEPARTMENTS. EXCELLENT THIRD THEIR TOP NOTCH. AND THEY'RE SUCH A GREAT POTENTIAL THAT WE ARE THAT WE ARE THAT WE OUGHT EXAMINED. IT IT JUST STOOD IT JUST. IT IT'LL BE A RANGE THOUGH. ALRIGHT THANK YOU SENATOR MR ACOSTA. WELL THE CENTER LEFT OUT. THE MATADORS A CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY NORTHRIDGE. WHICH IT WHICH HAS A WONDERFUL A PROGRAM YOU COULD KEEP GOING AND THEY'LL WE GOT WE GOT A GREAT S. C. ISSUE AND UC SYSTEM AS WE ALL KNOW. AND A AND APPRECIATE OKAY WHEN WE KNEW. WE GET POSTER  <u><c.green>POSTERS IN HERE</c></u> OKAY SO. TO MY COLLEAGUE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER OBERNOLTE STE POINT I'M I HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE AUTHOR AND HAVE A COUPLE OF OTHER QUICK QUESTIONS AS WELL. MISS HOWELL. THE CHAIR MENTIONED A ABOUT A RULE ABOUT AMENDING AUDITS ETCETERA WITH THE INDULGENCE OF MY COLLEAGUES WHO BROUGHT FORTH THE AUDIT. BOB. YEAH AND OF COURSE ANY WE RULE CAN BE WAY WE JUST WAVED ONE A LITTLE LITTLE BIT AGO ANOTHER ON IT. A TO A MOVE CONSENT COUNTER. DO YOU SEE THE THE THE ALL THE STE DOES TALK ABOUT. THE. WHETHER NOT THE HIGH SPEED RAIL SELF SUSTAINING OUT ABOUT THIS REPORT THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR INVOLVED GREED THAT THAT'S SOMETHING WE REALLY NEED THIS BUSINESS PLAN. THAT SEEMS TO ME THAT HAS BEEN AMENDED IN NEEDS TO BE AMENDED AGAIN. IT WAS SOLD TO THE PUBLIC IN A CERTAIN WAY THIS THIS YOU KNOW. THIS PROPOSITION AND NOW IT SEEMS LIKE WERE WERE THE OTHER THAT THE CART BEFORE THE HORSE AGAIN AND AND WORK GOING BACKWARD SAYING IS THIS EVEN VIABLE. DO YOU SEE IT POSSIBLE UNDER THE SCOPE OF THE AUDIT WITHOUT MATERIALLY CHANGING. THE COST THE TIME FRAME IT CETERA. THIS AUDIT BEING ABLE TO ENCOMPASS WHETHER OR NOT HIGH SPEED RAIL. AYE IS SELF SUSTAINING AND I HAVE A. COMMENT OR FOLLOW UP AFTER THAT. FOR ME. WELL AS I AS I INDICATED. MR CUSTER WERE WITH MR ARE OBERNOLTE QUESTION IT IT ISN'T CONTEMPLATED IN THE CURRENT SCOPE AND OBJECTIVES. IT WOULD BE AN ADDITIONAL OBJECTIVE BOMB I THINK WHAT WE WOULD NEED TO DO AND MISTER RICHARD I THINK INDICATED THE BUSINESS PLAN WAS COMING OUT IN APRIL OR MAY PERHAPS. IT WOULD BE ADDITIONAL WORK THAT WE WOULD NEED TO DO OVER AND ABOVE WHAT'S IN HERE. DETERMINING WHETHER OR% NOT IT'S A SUBSTANTIAL CHANGE IT'S IT'S. A NEW OBJECTIVE. I THINK THE COMMITTEE YOU. KNOW WOULD NEED TO DECIDE IF THAT'S SOMETHING AND MEMBER. WANTED TO AMEND IT. WE CERTAINLY COULD LOOK AT THE BUSINESS PLAN BUT IF YOU WANTED US TO DO YOU ANALYSIS SIMILAR TO WHAT WE DID IN OUR PRIOR AUDIT. THAT WAS THIS. A FAIR AMOUNT OF WORK AS FAR AS LOOKING AT THE BUSINESS PLAN AYE UNDERSTANDING THE VARIOUS FUNDING SOURCES BECAUSE THE CONCERN WE HAD IN THE IN THE FIRST AND IT WAS THEIR FIRST BUSINESS PLAN WAS. THE RELIANCE ON PRIVATE SECTOR INVESTMENT AS OPPOSED TO FEDERAL MONEY COMING AND THERE WAS FEDERAL MONEY THAT WAS PROPOSED BUT AT THAT POINT IT REALLY THE ONLY FEDERAL MONEY THAT WAS INVESTED THAT POINT TIME WAS. THROUGH THE RECOVERY ACT WITH I THINK A COUPLE. MAYBE A COUPLE BILLION OR I DON'T REMEMBER HOW WHAT THE DOLLAR AMOUNT WAS BUT IT WAS LIMITED AS FAR AS FEDERAL MONEY THERE WAS QUESTIONED AS TO HOW MUCH. PRIVATE SECTOR MONEY WOULD BE INVESTED SO THERE REALLY WAS A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF RELIANCE AT THAT POINT AND TIME. ON THE BOND MONEY AND STE AND STATE FUND SO WE WOULD NEED TO DO. TOGETHER AT THAT QUESTION AND TO DO A FAIR ANALYSIS. I THINK IT. A FAIRLY SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF HOURS WOULD NEED TO BE ADDED TO THE AUDIT TO REALLY TAKE A HARD LOOK AT THE BUSINESS PLAN AND ENGAGE WITH. THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY TO UNDERSTAND HOW THEY CAME UP WITH THEIR NEW. PLAN. YA PARTICULARLY WITH RESPECT TO FINANCING FOR THE SYSTEM AND THEN THEIR EVENTUAL. GOAL OF HAVING IT BE SELF SUSTAINING. I DON'T KNOW IF THAT. WELL AGAIN IT'S THE COMMITTEES YET IT IS THE COMMITTEE'S PURVIEW AND AND AND I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU KNOW THAT THIS SHOULD BE ONE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL QUESTIONS THAT WE ASK. IN THIS PROCESS BECAUSE THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY THIS FAR IN A MINUTE DECADE VIRTUALLY INTO THIS. YOU KNOW THE PROPOSITION IN THE FUNDING STARTING TO ROLL OUT ITS CETERA THAT WERE. WE LOOKING ITS MASSIVE COST OVERRUNS AND DELAYS AND WEARING THEEASIEST PART OF THE CONSTRUCTION IN MY HUMBLE OPINION NOT BEING INSTRUCTION MAGNET HERE. BUT IT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT ALL THE REPORTS ALL THE STUDIES INDICATE THEY SHOULD BE THIS THE I UNDERSTAND THIS BEEN LAWSUITS AND THERE'S BEEN DELAYS ETCETERA I AND THAT'S JUST. PART AND PARCEL BUT. WE HAVE AN A EVEN APPROACH THE TO HATCH BEACH YET TO GET IT TO LA WHICH IS WHICH IS BY THE WAY A COMMITMENT OF. THE PROPOSITION. AND THAT IS SELF SUSTAINING AND IT'S GOING TO MEET THESE REQUIREMENTS IN THESE REQUIREMENTS IN TERMS OF PEOPLE AND IF YOU LOOK AT FOLKS IN MY DISTRICT. THEY'LL TELL YOU THEY'RE NOT GONNA DRIVE SOUTH HALF AN HOUR AND LITERALLY BYPASS BURBANK AIRPORT AND THE MULTIPLE AIRLINES THAT ARE COMPETITIVE THERE. TO GET ON A TRAIN AND AND GO NORTH WHEN THEY CAN JUST BE ON A PLANE IN AN HOUR AND AND THAT'S THAT'S A THAT'S A SUBJECT FOR ANOTHER DEBATE BUT IT'S PART AND PARCEL WITH. THE DISCUSSION THAT WE'RE HAVING HERE BECAUSE THE POLICY DECISIONS THE WEATHER FUTURE. GOT CAP AND TRADE MONEY IS IT IS IS IS ALLOCATED IS INFLUENCED. YOU KNOW. BY ALL THE ASPECTS OF THE ECONOMIC DATA AND THAT'S A BIG THE WITHOUT ONE OF THIS IS IF WE ALL KNEW IN THIS BODY. AN ART IRRESPECTIVE CHAMBERS THAT THIS WAS GOING I'M JUST PULLING NUMBERS OUT OF THING AIR THIS IS GOING TO REQUIRE FIVE BILLION DOLLAR YEAR SUBSIDY OR ONE BILLION DOLLAR YOUR SUBSIDY OR. IT'LL MAKE MONEY THOSE WILL INFLUENCE WHETHER OR NOT WE USE CAP AND TRADE DOLLARS NOW TO GET THIS CONSTRUCTED FOR A FUTURE BENEFIT. I THINK IT'S SELF EVIDENT IS THAT ARE EVEN MENTION ABOUT THE BUSINESSES BEING IN THOSE AREAS AND GOD BLESS ON MY I HAVE FAMILY AND FRIENDS IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. AND I THINK YOU KNOW THEY IT'S GREAT THAT THEY'RE GOING WELL. SORTIR DEAR BUSINESS BUT. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A POLICY DECISION THAT AFFECTS THE ENTIRE PART OF THE STATE ENTIRE STATE OF CALIFORNIA NOT JUST ONE PIECE OF IT NOT JUST SILICON VALLEY. ARE NOT JUST THE SPARTANS THE BULLDOG SCENE OF MAYBE THE BOOSTER CLUBS CAN TAKE UP AND BY A TRAIN HERE BUT. YOU WORK WERE TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING THAT YOU KNOW I FRANKLY LIKE TO SEE IN AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUES AT THIS THE SCOPE NEEDS TO BE TWEAKED IF THEY'RE IF THEY'RE ASO INDULGENT. BECAUSE THAT WOULD REALLY. ENCOURAGE ME TO SUPPORT IT I I HAVE TO BE SUPPORTIVE ANYWAY BUT. THAT I SHOULDN'T TAKE MY HAND. THIS REALLY SHOULD BE A MORE COMPREHENSIVE. NOW AUDIT THAN WHAT I SEE NOW AND I'D BE VERY. A BILL ALL THE TIME DISAPPOINTED IF WE DON'T WE DON'T ADD THAT ELEMENT TO IT FOUND QUITE FRANKLY. THANK YOU. RIGHT. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. ANY OF PUBLIC COMMENTS. ANYONE FROM THE PUBLIC LIKE TO COMMENT ON THIS MATTER PLEASE COME FORWARD. SEEING NO ONE RUSHED FORWARD. ALRIGHT. IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE REQUEST YEARS OF THIS AUDIT TO TO. MAKE ANY CLOSING COMMENTS AND AND PERHAPS IF YOU'D LIKE TO. ADDRESS THE. REQUESTS MADE BY A SEVERAL MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE TO. POTENTIALLY. AS HE AUDIT LARGER CHARACTERIZE ADDING ANOTHER OBJECTIVE TO THE AUDIT REQUEST. OR NOT OF PLEASED TO ADDRESS THAT ALSO. STARTING WITH THE DELETE REQUEST FOR CENTER BELL WELL I THINK OF OF THEM. AGUILA I URGE SUPPORT FOR THE AUDIT SO THIS OF BIPARTISAN REQUEST AND. DETAILS OF THIS REQUESTED THAT WORKED OUT IN A BIPARTISAN FASHION. WE WILL RESPOND TO THE CONCERNS ON. BUSINESS PLAN AND. HAVE. IN ABOUT TWO MONTHS. QUICKER THAN THE AUDITS. RESULTS FROM AND. OF INFORMATION REGARDING THE. OPERATING OUT FEASIBILITY OF THE OF THE HIGH SPEED RAIL. AFTER THAT OUGHT TO ONE THE AUDITS COMPLETED IF WE WANT TO ADD SOMETHING. DOWN THE ROAD WE CAN DO THAT THAT'S WHERE I WOULD LIKE TO PROPOSE. WE HANDLE THAT PARTICULAR ISSUE. OUR SUPPORT FOR THIS REQUEST. THANK YOU. TOM AS I SAID IS STATED. EARLIER. OF THE NATURE OF BIPARTISANSHIP IS THAT. NOBODY GETS THE WHOLE LOT OF. AND THAT THAT'S JUST THE WAY IT IS. OUR I I WANT TO SAY I THINK WE'VE MADE SIGNIFICANT STRIDES WITH THE AUDIT AND THEN AND ENCOURAGE. THAT OUT OF A SUPPORT VOTE STUFF FOR IT. AT AND I THINK ALSO THE. OBVIOUS REALISATION OF EVERYBODY HERE THAT WE'RE IN A SIGNIFICANT ERA WITH RESPECT TO THIS PROJECT. AND THIS AUDIT AND THE BUSINESS PLANNING AND OUR. OVERSIGHT DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES GOING FORWARD IN THIS YEAR WILL HAVE TO BE VERY MUCH FOCUSED ON A LOT OF THE DEPTH AT. DEEP QUESTIONS. MY SUGGESTION IS THAT WE WILL. OPEN THIS AUDIT ACCORDING TO THE SCOPE WE HAVE AGREED TO THAT SCOPE AND THE AUDITOR HAS A STERLING REPUTATION. OF GETTING TO THE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SCOPES THAT THAT THAT THAT SHE AUDITS WE APPRECIATE THAT. WE HAVE COMMITMENTS HERE FROM THE HIGH SPEED. RAIL A LEADERSHIP THAT THIS BUSINESS PLAN WILL IN FACT ADDRESS. AS DEEPLY ANEST THAT COMPLETELY AS POSSIBLE. REALLY WHAT I THINK IS THE BIZ THE BIG QUESTION IN THE ROOM. IS THERE FUNDS TO COMPLETE. EVEN GET VALLEY TO VALLEY. THAT IS UP IN THE AIR IT SEEMS TO ME SO THIS GOING IN ONGOING. SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES WE'RE GONNA LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING. THAT DILIGENTLY WITH RESPECT TO THE. TO THE BUSINESS PLAN THAT AS. THE SENATOR SUGGESTED THAT AS WE GET INTO THE AUDIT AND AS WE SEE THE BUSINESS PLAN THERE MAY VERY WELL ME. TO BE A DEEPER AND MORE A SIGNIFICANT DIVE BUT RIGHT NOW THIS IS. WHAT WE HAVE AGREED TO AND I THINK WE SHOULD BE? THAT CONSISTENT EL BUT WITH OUR COMMITMENTS ONE TO ANOTHER AND TO ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. ACTUALLY IT'S BEEN MOVED BY MS RUBIO AND SECONDED BY MS BAKER. YOU KNOW I AGAIN WANT TO COMMENT MY COLLEAGUES FOR THE BIPARTISAN NATURE OF THIS REQUEST. IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US SAYS CALIFORNIANS TO GET TO THE TRUTH AND THIS AUDIT WILL HELP US TO DO JUST THAT. I HOPE AS WE LOOK AT THE AUDIT ONE OF THE FACTORS WE LOOK AT IS THE FACT THAT TIME IS MONEY. AND THAT THE DELAYS AND LITIGATIONS THEMSELVES ARE COSTING THE AUTHORITY. WHAT DO WE DO AS A STATE TO ENSURE THE VIABILITY TO HELP CREATE THE EFFICIENCIES WE NEED WITHIN THE AUTHORITY? AND HOW WE ARE LOOKING TO BE GOOD STEWARDS OF TAXPAYER DOLLARS MUST ALSO MEAN THAT WE HELPED TO CREATE SOME MOMENTUM FOR A PROJECT OF THIS MAGNITUDE. I LOOK FORWARD TO THE REST OF THE STATE REALIZING THE BENEFITS THAT ARE OCCURRING RIGHT NOW IN MY COMMUNITY AND I INVITE EACH AND EVERYONE OF YOU WHO ARE HERE. TO COME AND SEE MY DISTRICT AND SEE WHERE HIGH SPEED RAIL IS BEING BUILT. ALRIGHT. I WANT TO I JOIN MY COLLEAGUES AND THANKING THE. REQUEST YEARS OF THIS AUDIT. IN A BIPARTISAN MANNER. I THINK THIS IS I GREW WITH MY COLLEAGUES THAT THIS IS A. A WELCOME. DEVELOPMENT TO HAVE INDEPENDENT NONPARTISAN AUDIT ON THE BIGGEST INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT IN THE HISTORY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR I KNOW ITS BEEN A LONG MORNING FOR THE COMMITTEE SO I'LL KEEP IT BRIEF ESPECIALLY BECAUSE. I HAVE SHARED THIS AUDIT REQUEST WITH THE COMMITTEE UP EARLIER THIS YEAR EARLIER VERSION OF IT AND WE HAD A VERY GOOD SUBSTANCE DEBATE. I THINK. THIS WEEK WE HEARD THE SUBSTANCE OF THIS ISSUE RAISED IN THE GOVERNOR STATE OF STATE ADDRESS WHERE HE REFERENCE THE FIVE BILLION DOLLAR COST OVERRUN ON THE BAY BRIDGE AS A LAUGH LINE. ANDI DON'T THINK THAT IS RESPECTFUL TO THE RATE PAYERS THAT THE TOLL PAIRS ACROSS THE BAY AREA BRIDGES. I'M GLAD DIED TO BRING THIS BACK TO YOU A IN A TIMELY MANNER AFTER THAT AND ALSO GRATEFUL HAVE SENATOR BILL SUPPORT. FOR THIS AUDIT REQUEST. ALRIGHT. MOST MEN BEEN MADE BY SANDRA BELL SECOND BY MISS BAKER. MS HOW. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I'LL QUICKLY GO THROUGH THE AUDIT OBJECTIVES ESSENTIALLY WHAT MISTER LEVINE IS ASKING US TO LOOK AT IS. RECORDS RELATED TO THE BAY BRIDGE CONSTRUCTION OF ANY COST OVERRUNS WHAT THIS SOURCE OF FUNDING FOR THOSE COST OVERRUNS ARE WERE OR ARE ARE THERE ANY EXISTING OBLIGATIONS THAT THEY NEED TO CONTINUE TO PAY INCLUDING DEBT. WHETHER OR NOT THOSE COST OVERRUNS HAVE AFFECTED OTHER CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS OTHER BAY ON PARTICULARLY ON OTHER BAY AREA BRIDGES. IS THERE ANY CONTINUED FINANCIAL RISK AS A RESULT OF THE CONSTRUCTION. AND WHAT SORT OF FUNDING WILL THEY USE TO COVER THAT RISK. IN ADDITION ASKING US TO LOOK AT THE DEFECTS AND WHAT THE TOTAL COST OF THOSE DEFECTS THAT WERE IDENTIFIED BY A METROPOLITAN TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION BETA AND CALTRANS AND AGAIN WHAT THE SOURCE OF FUNDING IS FOR THOSE. WHAT LESSONS LEARNS WERE DERIVED FROM THOSE PARTICULAR? DEFECTS AND THAT PROCESS AND HAVE HAVE THE. ASSOCIATED ENTITIES MTC AND CALTRANS IN PARTICULAR MODIFIED THEIR. PROJECTS IN THE FUTURE OR THEIR APPROACHES TO PREVENT DEFECTS AND CERTAINLY TO MITIGATE ANY COST OVERRUNS AND THEN THE FINAL TWO OBJECTIVES RELATED TO RISK MANAGEMENT AGAIN. LOOKING TO THE FUTURE WHAT TYPES OF RISK MANAGEMENT PRACTICES WILL THEY USE OR MODIFY OUR IN MAKING SURE THAT FUTURE PROJECTS ARE STAY WITHIN BUDGET AND THAT THE FUNDING IS MEANT MANAGED EFFECTIVELY. AND THEN THE LAST OBJECTIVE IS RELATED TO THE. TOLL BRIDGE SEISMIC RETROFIT PROGRAM LOOKING AT HOW LONG IT WILL TAKE TO PAY OFF ANY EXISTING DEBT OBLIGATIONS RELATED TO THAT PROGRAM THE BUDGET FOR THIS AUDIT ABOUT TWENTY FOUR HUNDRED HOURS. THAT'S ABOUT A SIX MONTH TIME FRAME FOR MY STAFF THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MR LIVING YOU HAVE ANY WITNESSES ALRIGHT. IS THERE A REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE. RESPONDING AGENCIES PLEASE COME FOR. GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN MERIT SUCIA MEMBERS MY NAME IS REBECCA ON AND I'M THE MANAGER OF GOVERNMENT RELATIONS FOR MTC AND DATA. THEM AS WAS MENTIONED THIS IS THE SECOND TIME I ASSEMBLYMEMBER LEVINE HAS MADE THIS REQUEST OF MY AGENCY. AND CALTRANS SINCE LAST YEAR WHEN HE SUBMITTED THE ORIGINAL REQUEST WE'VE WORKED DILIGENTLY TO PROVIDE A DETAILED RESPONSE. I'M AT THIS TIME I'D LIKE TO ASK THE SERGEANT TO PLEASE DISTRIBUTE THE LETTER WE PROVIDED ASSEMBLY MEMBER LEVINE AT SEPTEMBER WHICH INCLUDES. ELEVEN PAGES OF ANSWERS TO THE SPECIFIC QUESTIONS THAT ARE POSED IN THIS NEW REQUEST. WE'VE ACTUALLY ASSEMBLED ALL OF THE REFERENCE REPORTS IN HARD COPY IS WHILE. OTHER DOCUMENTS TAKE UP AT LEAST THIRTY BINDERS ON INSTEAD OF HAULING THAT UP HERE TODAY WE DECIDE TO KEEP THINGS SIMPLE AND PROVIDE PHOTO. I BUT IF DESIRED WE ARE HAPPY TO BRING ALL OF THAT HARD COPY MATERIAL TO SOMEONE ABILITY. MEMBERS THE POINT I'M TRYING TO MAKE IS THAT THERE'S REALLY NO NEED FOR AN AUDIT COTTINGHAM COMPEL MY AGENCY TO PROVIDE ANSWERS TO THE QUESTIONS. ON IN ASSEMBLY MEMBER LEVINE'S REQUEST WE HAVE ALREADY DONE SO. NONE THE LESS PERHAPS THE MOST IMPORTANT QUESTION ASSEMBLYMEMBER LEVINE ASKS IS WHAT LESSONS HAVE BEEN LEARNED. IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE BAY BRIDGES COST OVERRUNS THIS IT'S NO SECRET HAS ALREADY BEEN THE SUBJECT OF SEVERAL STATE AUDITS. BUT IT BEARS REPEATING. THANKS TO THE LEGISLATURE'S ANNOUNCEMENT OF AB ONE FORTY FOUR IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE THE TOLL BRIDGE PROJECT OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE THAT WAS ESTABLISHED BY THAT BILL. AND IS COMPRISED OF MY AGENCIES EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA TRANSPORTATIONS. COMMISSIONS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AND THE CALTRANS DIRECTOR HAD BEEN ABLE TO KEEP THE BAY BRIDGE AND THE OTHER TOLL BRIDGE SEISMIC PROJECTS WITHIN THE BUDGET AND SCHEDULE SET AT THAT TIME NOW THIRTEEN YEARS AGO. HOW? MOST IMPORTANTLY THE TV POCK AS IT'S KNOWN CREATED A RISK MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE THAT ENABLE PROBLEMS TO BE IDENTIFIED EARLY. AND HOLDS PROJECT MANAGERS ACCOUNTABLE IN AN OPEN AND TRANSPARENT MANNER. THE MEETINGS OF COURSE ARE OPEN TO THE PUBLIC ARE WE SUBMIT QUARTERLY REPORTS ON EVERY STEP OF THE WAY. ON SO THAT ALL OF THE ISSUES THAT ARE COMING UP ON IDENTIFIED EARLY IN AND IT VERY TRANSPARENT. TRANSPARENT MEANT MANNER. ADDITIONALLY BECAUSE CONTINGENCIES WERE ADDED TO EACH CONTRACT BECAUSE A SIMPLE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THAT COMPLEX CAPITAL PROJECTS OFTEN COST MORE THAN ORIGINALLY FORECAST AS WE'VE ALREADY BEEN DISCUSSING TODAY. IN FACT THE TV POP HAS BECOME A MODEL FOR OTHER MAKE PROJECTS AND IS HERALDED AS A MODEL IN THE NATIONAL RESEARCH ON THE SUBJECT. RECOGNIZING THE IMPORTANCE OF OVERSIGHT ON COST CONTROL THE CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO HAS CREATED A SIMILAR OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE FOR THE TRANSBAY TRANSIT CENTER. AND INVITED OUR EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR STEVE HAMM ANGER TO SERVE ON IT BECAUSE OF HIS EXPERIENCE ON THE TV POCK. IN CONCLUSION THE LESSONS OF THE BAY BRIDGE ARE BEING APPLIED TO OTHER PROJECTS IN THE BAY AREA AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY. EVERYDAY ON WITHOUT I'D LIKE TO TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE. CALTRANS DIRECTOR OF MALCOLM DOUGHERTY THOUGHTS PAVE THE CHAIR. THANK YOU. WELL GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. JUST ECHO US SOME OF THE SAME POINTS IN ELABORATE SLIGHTLY AND PUT FIRST FOREMOST. I WOULD SAY THAT THE DEPARTMENT WOULD. BE PREPARED TO ASSIST IN ANY. AUDIT THAT THE STATE AUDITOR CONDUCTED. AT THE REQUEST OF THAT THIS BODY AYE THE NEWLY SPAN AS PART OF AN OVER ARCHING A TOLL BRIDGE PROGRAM TO SEISMICALLY UPGRADE ALL THE TOLL BRIDGES IN THE BAY AREA. OF COURSE THE BAY BRIDGE WAS THE ONLY REPLACEMENT THE OTHERS WERE RETROFITTED. THEY'RE OBVIOUSLY HAVE BEEN MANY DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION CHALLENGES THAT WERE OVERCOME ON THIS PROJECT. BUT AS WAS MENTIONED BEFORE ONE SIGNIFICANT POINT TIME WAS IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE WHEN ASSEMBLY BILL ONE FORTY FOUR WAS WAS PASSED IN YSTAD WISHED A TIME FRAME. ANDY BUDGET FORCED TO CONDUCT THE REMAINDER OF THAT WORK IN THAT LEGISLATION. NOT ONLY CREATED THAT SCHEDULE WHICH CALLED FOR THE BRIDGE TO BE OPEN AT THE END OF SEPTEMBER TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN WHICH IT WAS BUT IT ALSO ESTABLISHED. UP A BUDGET. AND WE ARE STILL ACTIVELY FIGHTING TO STAY WITHIN THAT BUDGET THAT WAS ESTABLISHED IN TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE. AND I CHALLENGE YOU TO FIND ANOTHER MEGA PROJECT ON ITS ORDER TO STAY WITHIN A BUDGET AND ON SCHEDULE FOR THE LAST EIGHT YEARS OF ITS EXISTENCE. BUT AS JUST AS IMPORTANT CREATED THE TOLL BRIDGE PROGRAM OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE WITH THREE MEMBER AGENCIES MYSELF. THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CDC AND THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AND TO SEE ABOUT IT WHICH WAS MENTIONED. OF THAT BODY APPROVED ALL DESIGN CHANGES AND ALSO A APPROVED OF ALL CHANGE ORDERS OVER A CERTAIN THRESHOLD THE BODY DOES MEET IN PUBLIC I WOULD ALSO. COMMENT THAT. IT IS IN ACCORDANCE WITH BAG WE CAN THANK THE LEGISLATION BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER BAKER. BAKER. BUT WE ALSO AND I CALLED FOR QUARTERLY REPORTS SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE AND WHEN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN IS DISTRIBUTED. ARE VERY SHORTLY YOU WILL BE THE FORTY EIGHT SUCH QUARTERLY REPORT THAT WE DISTRIBUTE. AND ONE OF THINGS THAT I DO WANT NOTICES IS IT OUR. INDICATORS EVERYONE OF THOSE. REPORTS INDICATED THE ORIGINAL BUDGET ANY ADJUSTMENTS TO THOSE BUDGET AND EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE ON THE COST TO DATE AND THE PROJECTED COST AT THE COMPLETION. OF OF THAT TASK AND WE'VE BEEN DOING THAT QUARTERLY FOR THE LACK OF FOR SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE. WE ARE BEING VERY AGGRESSIVE IN COMING IN ON THE BUDGET SET IN TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE AND BE VERY INNOVATIVE AND UTILIZING DIFFERENT. A CONTRACTING METHODS TO TRY TO SAVE TIME AND MONEY THE MOST RECENT EXAMPLE WOULD BE THE ACCELERATED TIMEFRAME THAT WE DID THE AND. DEMOLITION OF THE MARINE FOUNDATIONS WHICH WE SHAVED OFF A YEAR AND SAVE TENS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. SO WITH THAT SAID I I THINK IT IS APPROPRIATE TO DO LESSONS LEARNED WE HAVE CONDUCTED SUCH AN EXERCISE AND I THINK THERE WILL BE A TIME TO DO SO. AT ANOTHER TIME. IN ADDITION TO THE ONE THAT'S ALREADY BEEN COMPLETED ONE WERE WRAPPED UP WITH ALL THE REMAINING ACTIVITIES. BUT AGAIN WE STAND READY DO PARA SUPPORT THE STATE AUDITOR IF AT ALL IT WAS A REQUESTED BY THIS BODY ON AND WITHOUT I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ALRIGHT QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE MS RUBIO. IT'S JUST A COMMENT I UNDERSTAND AND I CAN FEEL THE THE TENSION HERE BUT IT'S REALLY CONDESCENDING WHEN YOU BRING A PICTURE OF THIRTEEN BINDERS HAS THEREFORE NOT KEEP LEVEL OF UNDERSTANDING THAT THIRTEEN BINDERS IS HARD TO COME UP. WHATEVER'S GOING ON. BETWEEN YOU AND MR LEVIN SHOULD NOT BLEED INTO OUR OUR OUR POSITION HERE I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT'S GOING ON I'M FROM SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND IT'S REALLY JUST FEELS VERY DISRESPECTFUL. TO GET OF A PICTURE OF A BINDER SO I CAN BE JUST A SARCASTIC AND ASK YOU WHEN YOU GONNA PARTICIPATE ARE GONNA SEND PICTURES TO THE AUDITOR. I I JUST WANTED TO POINT THAT OUT BECAUSE AGAIN IT FEELS VERY DISRESPECTFUL WHATEVER IS GOING ON BETWEEN MR LEVINE AND YOUR DEPARTMENT IS NOT WHAT I'M HERE TO ASSESS. SO I JUST WANTED TO POINT THAT OUT. I WANT TO LISTEN TO THE MERITS OF THAT THE REQUEST OF THE AUDIT AND AGAIN I'VE SEEN THIS BEFORE WHEN THE MEMBERS ARE HAVING SPATS BETWEEN THE DEPTH OF THEIR THEIR AGENCIES. AND AND AGAIN I WOULD CAUTION YOU FOR NEXT TIME DIED WHEN SOMETHING LIKE THIS HAPPENED SOMEBODY LIKE ME WOULD BE COMPELLED JUST TO DO THE AUDIT JUST BECAUSE. OF THE SARCASM INVOLVED. BUT MY APOLOGIES ASSEMBLY MEMBER I UNDERSTAND YOUR POINT I THINK THAT WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO REALLY CONVEY IS THAT A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF WORK AND RESPONSIVENESS THAT WE HAVE ALREADY PROVIDED. AND WE THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD BE LESS KERN. IN YOUR FACE IF YOU WILL THEN BRINGING UP THE BINDERS THEMSELVES WHICH YOU KNOW IS THAT WOULD TAKE UP AS A HUGE MASS SPACE THAT WOULD BE A. SERIOUS INCONVENIENCE ON ITSELF AYE BUT POINT TAKEN. ALRIGHT CENTER BAKER THENCE OF BURRIS. AND MS BAKER THEN CENTER BELL. I THINK YOU MISTER CHAIR. I. SUPPORT YOUR ORIGINAL AUDIT MISTER LEVINE I THOUGHT IT WAS VERY WELL WRITTEN SEVERAL MONTHS AGO I'M ONLY SORRY THAT IT DIDN'T HAPPEN EARLIER BECAUSE WE DO HAVE THE BALLOT MEASURE COMING FORWARDBEFORE BAY AREA VOTERS WHERE THIS WOULD BE HELPFUL INFORMATION HOW. AND I DISAGREE THAT IT'S NOT NECESSARY I UNDERSTAND THERE HAVE BEEN STUDIES AYE AYE REPRESENTING EAST BAY DISTRICT I HAVE THOUSANDS OF NOT TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CONSTITUENTS PAIN THOSE TOLLS EVERYDAY. GOING ACROSS THE BRIDGE. AND WHAT WHAT WHAT HAS NOT HAPPENED ISN'T JUST THAT WE'VE LEARNED OUR LESSON. ITEM NUMBER FOUR IN THE REQUEST WHICH IS HAVE YOU CHANGED YOUR PRACTICES. THAT IS PROBABLY THE SINGLE BEST PART IN MY OPINION OF THIS AUDIT WITH THAT WE HAVE NOT SEEN. AND AND WHAT YOU DON'T WANT. IS BINDERS AND STACKS OF REPORTS INTERNAL. I REVIEW THAT LISTS ALL THE THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN DONE DIFFERENTLY STACKED UP AND NOT ACTUALLY APPLIED IN PRACTICE. SO. I WAS HOPING THAT THERE WOULD BE A FULL EMBRACE OF THIS AUDIT FOR THAT REASON ALONE WHICH IS. YEP FOLKS WHEN THEY SEE SUCH A PROJECT WITH SUCH COST OVERRUNS. BEYOND WHAT YOU WOULD NORMALLY EXPECT IN A. IN A PUBLIC WORKS PROJECT. THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE FOR ANY DO ALL THE STUDIES TO FIND OUT WHAT WENT WRONG THEY'RE GONNA CHANGE THEY'RE GONNA CHANGE THEIR PRACTICES. THIS IS THE ONLY AUDIT I'VE SEEN THAT THAT. WILL REALLY LOOK AT HAVE YOU ACTUALLY DONE IT NUMBER ONE. SO IT IS NEEDED AND I I HOPE THERE WILL BE A FULL EMBRACE. AND IT GETS ME NUMBER TWO BECAUSE THERE'S TOO LITTLE INDEPENDENCE THAT A AND M. T. C. ARE BASICALLY ONE IN THE SAME. AND THERE'S ONLY THREE VOICES AND IN THEM. AND I BELIEVE THERE NEEDS TO BE EXACTLY THE TYPE OF NONPARTISAN INDEPENDENT COMPLETELY OUTSIDE AUDIT TO LOOK AT. NOT ONLY THE OTHER AT ELEMENTS OF THE OUT OF A PARTICULAR NUMBER FOUR. AND SO I THINK YOU MISTER LEVINE FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. I I LIKE TO ASK THE AUDITOR IT'S UNFORTUNATE I DON'T KNOW THAT THIS WILL BE. OUT AND AVAILABLE TO US IN TIME FOR THE BAY AREA TO DECIDE IF IT'S GONNA RAISE ITS TOLLS. AND END TO SEE THAT YOU'VE EARNED THE AT THESE ENTITIES OF EARNS THAT ADDITIONAL MONEY IN TERMS OF THEIR PRACTICES. DO YOU HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY TO START WITH ONE PARTICULAR PART OF THE AUDIT AND REALLY DIVE INTO THAT FIRST IS THAT. AT IS THAT PRUDENT WITH THAT MESS UP THE ABILITY FOR YOU TO HAVE AN EFFECTIVE OUTCOME BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE WANT IS EFFECTIVE INFORMATION BUT I'M. AND I AM NOT LOOKING NEITHER WAS I BEFORE TO AMEND THE AUDIT I'M JUST CURIOUS IF YOU HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY TO. GET TO A QUESTION EARLIER. AND PROVIDE THAT TO US. WE CERTAINLY CAN'T DO THAT. WHAT WEEK WE COULD DO ON THIS PARTICULAR PROJECT AND AS I NOTED IN MY OPENING COMMENTS THERE THERE WEREN'T ANY AUDITS WHERE THERE WAS A SPECIFIC DEADLINE REQUESTED BY? THE MEMBER. BUT WHAT WE WE COULD TAKE TWO APPROACHES TO THIS PARTICULAR PROJECT IF IT'S THE DESIRE THE COMMITTEE TO HAVE THIS BE A. PRIORITY I HAVE TEAMS AS I INDICATED THAT ALREADY HIT THE GROUND RUNNING SO. IF THE COMMITTEE CHOOSES TO APPROVE THIS AUDIT WE WERE ASSIGNED STAFF TO IMMEDIATELY. GET THE AUDIT STARTED WE COULD AGAIN TAKE TWO APPROACHES. POTENTIALLY THROW ADDITIONAL RESOURCES AT IT TO TRY TO GET IT DONE. BEFORE I THINK THE REGIONAL MEASURES ON THE BALLOT FOR EARLY JUNE SO THIS WOULD BE A VERY TIGHT TIMEFRAME. THE OTHER THING THAT WE COULD DO IS IF THERE'S A DESIRE BY THE COMMITTEE TO HAVE ANSWERS TO CERTAIN OBJECTIVES. WHAT WE HAVE DONE IN THE PAST AS WE'VE ISSUED TWO REPORTS THERE'S A POINT ONE THAT ADDRESSES THESE TWO OBJECTIVES AND HERE'S A POINT TO THAT ADDRESSES THE REMAINDER OF? THE QUESTIONS THAT MR LEVINE AND CERTAINLY THE COMMITTEE IF THE COMMITTEE APPROVES THE THE AUDIT SO THAT'S THAT'S AN OPTION THAT NAM WE COULD CONSIDER AS WELL. AND AND AND I WOULD WELCOME AT IT WITH RESPECT TO OUR. COLLEAGUES HAVE AUTHORED THE AUDIT YOUR YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT BECAUSE I I DO THINK THE SUBSTANCE OF THIS IS SO IMPORTANT FOR THE DECISION THAT WILL BE MADE. PROBABLY JUNE MAYBE NOVEMBER. AND. AND A IN THE INTEREST OF FULL TRANSPARENCY AND OWNING THAT BOTH THAT MEASURE AND.% BAY BRIDGE OPERATIONS HAVING THIS OUT THERE IF I MAY ASK MISTER LEVINE DO YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS ON EITHER OF THOSE TWO OPTIONS. WHICH I MEAN TO SPRING ON YOU I DIDN'T REALIZE THEY WERE TO OPTION THAT WE HAD IT'S AN INTERESTING QUESTION I I CERTAINLY HAD HOPED WHEN I PRESENTED THE AUDIT LAST YEAR THAT THIS WOULD BE SOMETHING BECAUSE IT WOULD BE COMPLETED. YOU KNOW BY NOW. I THAT ACTUALLY NTC BATTER CALTRANS COULD ACTUALLY DEMONSTRATE GOOD NEWS OR IF THERE WAS WORK TO DO. REMEDIATION TO BURN. THE TRUST IN SUPPORT OF THE PUBLIC JUST IN GENERAL NOT SPECIFIC TO ON A POLITICAL CAMPAIGN AROUND PASSAGE OF ARM THREE WHICH WE DID NOT KNOW. A DATE AND THAT WE ACTUALLY I DON'T BELIEVE THEY'VE ACTUALLY SET A DATE YET WHAT HAS BEEN SET HAVE. SO ON I KNEW THAT THAT WAS WHAT THEY WERE CONTEMPLATING. BUT IT WAS MY HOPE THAT THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO YOU KNOW EVEN IF THEY GOT A BAD. SCORE RIGHT OUT OF YOU KNOW ON THIS TEST SO TO SPEAK I THINK IT'S A LOOK YOU KNOW WE'RE GLAD WE GOT THAT SORTED DO A WHOLE LOT BETTER. SO BY THE TIMING OF THIS IS DIFFERENT I THINK. THE THING THAT'S MOST IMPORTANT TO ME AND I THINK TO THE MEMBERS IS THAT THE AUDIT IS. EXHAUSTIVE AND AND INEFFICIENT AT THE SAME TIME. AND THAT IT'S USABLE AND USEFUL BY THE AGENCIES AROUND AS WELL AS SIDE TO THIS BODY. ON TO PROVIDE THE OVERSIGHT THAT'S NECESSARY AND I DON'T WANT TO SIT HERE AND AND. DICTATE HOW THE AUDITOR USES HER RESOURCES AND I WOULD TRUST THE AUDITOR TO USE OUR RESOURCES IN A WAY THAT HELPS HER UP PURSUE THAT MISSION. OF I MEAN I I THINK YOU AND I THINK WHAT I HEARD. THE BEGINNING OF THIS YEAR IN A FEW HOURS AGO WAS WE'VE WE HAVE THE PEOPLE WE HAVE TIME WERE READY. AND WE DO HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE OF A TIME SENSITIVITY. I'M ALSO HEARING THAT YOU'VE I THINK IT ORIGIN AMOUNT THAT YOU CAN GET THIS WORK DONE. EVEN UNDER AN EXPEDITED I I PERSONALLY HAVE A CONCERN ABOUT BIFURCATING THERE ARE DOING DIFFERENT PARTS OF DIFFERENT TIMES I DON'T KNOW IF THAT NEEDS AN ADDITIONAL MOTION OR IF THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE AS A COMMITTEE IF WE AGREE. COULD COULD DIRECT BUT I WOULD HOPE THAT THE RESULTS TO THE OUT IT COULD BE AVAILABLE BEFORE IT WITHIN SEVERAL MONTHS ON THE TIME FRAME YOU'VE INDICATED WITH THE RESOURCES THAT YOU'VE SAID YOU MAY BE ABLE TO DEDICATE TO IT. AND THAT'S WHAT I WOULD MOVE IT IF IT HAS NEVER BEEN MOVED AND SECONDED NIGHT. SOUNDS LIKE IT MAY BE AGREEABLE. I YEAH. YEAH I THINK IT. I DON'T KNOW IF IT NEEDS A MOTION I'LL BE HONEST WITH YOU BUT I KNOW THAT I'VE HEARD IT YOU CAN DO THAT. IS TO PUT YOUR RESOURCES INTO IT AND I WOULD URGE US TO DO THAT IF IT TAKES ACTION FROM THIS COMMITTEE I WOULD URGE THAT AS WELL. WELL AS I INDICATED MS BAKER WE COULD CERTAINLY THROW WE HAVE THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE I'VE GOT STAFF READY TO START AUDITS AND HAVE COMPLETED AUDITS AND. ARE WORKING ON PARTICULAR PROJECTS IN HOUSE OUR LOCAL HIGH RISK PROGRAM AND OTHERS SO WE HAVE THE STAFF TO TO ASSIGNED TO THIS PARTICULAR PROJECT. ON IF IT'S THE DESIRE OF THE COMMITTEE FOR US TO GET THIS DONE BY A APPRECIATE THAT DIRECTION BUT WHAT WE WOULD DO IN A CIRCUMSTANCE LIKE THAT IF THE ENTIRE SCOPE OF THE AUDIT THEN AND SOUND LIKE MISTER LEVINE WANTS US TO KEEP THIS AS. COMPREHENSIVE TOGETHER THEN YOU KNOW WE WE'VE DONE THIS IN THE PAST WHERE WE'VE HAD A FAST TRACK AUDIT BUT IT'S PRETTY. TYPICALLY BEEN A REQUEST OF A MEMBER OR MOTION BY THE COMMITTEE TO SAY THAT WE WANT THE AUDITOR GET THIS AUDIT DONE. BY THE END OF MAY NAM IF THIS MEASURE IN FACT IS ON THE BALLOT. A FOR JUNE AND I THINK IT'S EARLY JUNE. WERE TALKING FOR MONTHS SO WE CAN DO IT. ARM IT WILL BE A PUSH BUT WE CAN DO IT. THAT'S THE DESIRE THE COMMITTEE. TERRIBLE. YOU THINK THE RULES SUBCOMMITTEE ARE WOULD MAKE A MOTION ON THE. I DON'T WHO WANT TO EXPEDITE THE HAS TO BE A SUBSEQUENT MOTION. IN THE RULES BUT MY. EMOTIONAL MAGRIS NEW. APPROVED A AUDIT THAT'S SO. I THINK IT'S SO FORTHRIGHTLY GOOD AUTO LIKE TO SEE THE FULL RESULTS. I MAKE A MOTION SIR. ASSEMBLYMAN AND I. HAD LONG DISCUSSIONS AND. CAN AGREEMENT ON THIS AND. I THINK IT WILL HELP THE AGENCY. IF WE DO THERE OUGHT SO THAT'S MY MOTION WHAT WHAT. IT DO YOU HAVE ANY OPINION AS TO A. EXPEDITING THE THE AUDIT WELL I HAVE AN OPINION ABOUT WHICH OUGHT TO BE EXPEDITED AND CERTAINLY YEAH I WOULD I WOULD THINK. YEAH I WOULD HAVE THE HIGHEST REAL. TO BE HONESTABOUT IT THAT'S THE ONE THAT HAS THE HIGHEST FINANCIAL REDUCE. SHE WANTED TO EXPEDITE ORDER THAT WOULD BE. THE ITEM THAT YOU WANNA. PLANS ARE HERE TO HAVE TO AUDIT EXPEDITED. AND IT MAY NOT AND THAT'S TO MOTIONS. JUST FOR CLARIFICATION I THOUGHT THE EXPERTS WERE EXPEDITING BUT THE RESULTS OF NUMBER FOR. ONLY. AND YOU'RE GONNA START THE AUDIT. THERE'S SOME CONFUSION SO I'M VERY MUCH I'M NOT I MEAN WE'RE STARTING THE AUDIT AND THE REQUEST WOULD BE TO. TO DO NUMBER ITEM NUMBER FOUR FIRST. IT'S WHAT I'M UNDERSTANDING OKAY SPIN AND PERHAPS AYE I CONFUSED THE SITUATION IS RUBIO WHAT I WAS WHEN I WAS RESPONDING TO MS BAKER'S QUESTION I SAID THERE ARE TWO OPTIONS ONE WOULD BE. TO THROW ADDITIONAL RESOURCES ASK THIS AUDIT PERHAPS. STAFF IT. UP MORE ROBUSTLY THAN WE TYPICALLY WOULD AND LOOK AT ALL LEVINE. INTERESTED. KING IT'S NOT OKAY GO AHEAD. OKAY THERE WE GO SO I I THINK IT'S THE DESIRE MISTER LEVINE THE REQUESTER AND I THINK THE COMMENTS BY MS BAKER AS WELL AS TO HAVE US DO THE ENTIRE AUDIT ALL AT ONCE. BUT. IF THE COMMITTEE DECIDES TO DIRECT US TO GET THE AUDIT DONE BY THE END OF MAY. THAT'S I THINK WHAT THE DISCUSSION I AM WISER THE MOTION THAT I MISSED BAKER WAS INDICATING SO WOULD BE LOOKING AT ALL OF THE OBJECTIVES. AS WE TYPICALLY DO AN AUDIT BUT TRYING TO GET THE WORK DONE BY THE END FOR ME ALSO THAT. OKAY. SO WHY DON'T WE. FIRST IS. ADDRESS THE MOTION AS TO WHETHER OR NOT TO APPROVE THIS AUDIT AND THEN WE CAN. HAVE A SUBSEQUENT IS. DISCUSSION TO ENTERTAIN A MOTION AS TO EXPEDITING. EITHER THIS OR HIGH SPEED RAIL OR. BOTH OR NEITHER AND RIGHT. I'VE. SO. SEE. ANY OTHER. LESSONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SEEING NONE. ARE THERE ANY PUBLIC COMMENTS ANYONE FROM THE AUDIENCE WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS THIS MATTER. SEEING NO ONE COMING FORWARD. MR LEVINE WHICH ELECT CLOSE. YEAH I THINK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU ALSO MEMBERS FOR THE THE QUALITY OF THE.
