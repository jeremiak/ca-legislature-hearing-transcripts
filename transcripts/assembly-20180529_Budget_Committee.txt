WE ARE SETTING ASIDE SEVENTEEN POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS INTO TOTAL RESERVES. WHICH IS A HISTORIC HEART. I IN ADDITION SOME OF THE MAJOR HIGHLIGHTS WHICH I KNOW EACH OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE CHAIRS WILL BE GOING IN. A LITTLE BIT MORE SPECIFICITY WAS APPROPRIATING A BILLION DOLLARS FOR HEALTH CARE. THE BULK OF THAT WAS TO EXPAND HEALTH CARE COVERAGE BUT ALSO TO REDUCE HEALTHCARE COSTS IN PREMIUM COSTS FOR MIDDLE CLASS. FAMILIES ARE STRUGGLING TO PAY WAR OUR PURCHASE HEALTH CARE. I IN ADDITION WE AGREED WITH THE GOVERNOR TO FULLY FUND THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA. ó WE DID APPROPRIATE ADDITIONAL MONEY TO OUR INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER READ BOTH THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA A HUNDRED AND SEVENTEEN FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN ADDITION TO WHAT THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED IN MAY. AS WELL AS TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS TO THEIR CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY WHICH WAS. I IN ADDITION TO WHAT THE GOVERNOR A PRO APPROPRIATE MAY. COME. WE ALSO DID A VERY SIGNIFICANT APPROPRIATIONS THE AREA OF HOMELESSNESS AS WE ALL KNOW HOMELESSNESS IS A CRISIS. NOT JUST IN OUR URBAN CENTERS BUT ALMOST IN EVERY CORNER OF CALIFORNIA WE'VE OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND I PEOPLE WHO ON ANY GIVEN NIGHT ARE HOMELESS HERE. IN CALIFORNIA DONE NUMBER SEEMS TO BE GROWING ON EVERY DAY WE ARE PROPOSING A ONE POINT SIX. BILLION DOLLAR EXPENDITURE TO FIGHT. HOMELESSNESS. THE BULK OF THAT IS APPROPRIATED TO. HELP OUR CITIES FIGHT HOMELESSNESS IN THE EMERGENCY SITUATION WHETHER IT'S BUILDING SHELTERS BUILDING APPLICATIONS CENTERS ARE RENTAL ASSISTANCE OR RAPID RE HOUSING. IN ADDITION A COUPLE OF. OTHER AREAS JUST TO KNOW IS WE APPROPRIATE NINE HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS TOTAL INCLUDING A FEDERAL FUNDS INTO EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION. AYE DAYCARE SLOTS PRESCHOOL AS WELL AS FACILITIES. OPERATIONS IF FACILITIES WELL UPGRADE SO THAT THE SCHOOLS CAN HELP BUILD IT INCREASE OUR CAPACITY TO OFFER PRESCHOOL. ARE IN ADDITION WE ARE WE APPROPRIATE HUNDRED FIFTY THREE FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TOWARD. THE CENSUS COUNT WE THINK THAT'S EXTRAORDINARILY IMPORTANT. IT'S A. STORE IT'S YOUR OWN CRITICAL THAT EVERY CALIFORNIA GETS COUNTED SO THAT WE CAN FIGHT FOR THE FEDERAL DOLLARS THAT WE NEED AS WELL AS MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE ADEQUATELY REPRESENTED IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. AND LAST WE. FOUND WE WERE HAPPY TO SEE THE. GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL OF. SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS TO EXPAND THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT WHICH LOWERED THE. AGE LIMIT ON WHO COULD QUALIFY FOR THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT. WE FELT THAT OVER THE YEARS THAT'S BEEN ONE OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAYS THAT WE CAN FIGHT. POVERTY I DON'T FORTUNATELY WE HAVE TOO MANY. FOLKS LIVING IN POVERTY IN CALIFORNIA AT THE SAME TIME THAT WE ARE NOW BECOME THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY. IN THE COUNTRY. OUT WITHOUT A TURN OVER TO BUY A VICE CHAIR MISTER WILL TO SEE IF HE HAS ANY. COMMENTS. BOB THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I WANT TO COMMEND THE WORK OF OUR BUDGET SUB COMMITTEES OVER THE LAST SIX MONTHS. I THINK PEOPLE OUTSIDE THE BUDGET COMMITTEE PROCESS DON'T REALIZE WHAT A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF WORK IT IS TO SERVE ON THOSE SUBCOMMITTEES. AND I I JUST WANT TO COMMEND ALL THE MEMBERS AND ALL THE STAFF THAT WAS THERE TO SUPPORT US OVER THE LAST SIX MONTHS BECAUSE I I KNOW THAT WE'VE WORKED VERY VERY HARD. POP. I THINK IT IS A VERY UNUSUAL SITUATION WE FIND OURSELVES AND TO HOW TO SPEND A NINE BILLION DOLLAR SURPLUS. I THINK THAT OUT OF THE CHAIR AND I SHARE A LOT OF THE COMMITMENTS TO OTHER INVESTMENTS IN INFRASTRUCTURE. NOW AND SHORING UP THE STATE'S RESERVE FUNDS ARE HOWEVER I I HAVE SOME FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEMS WITH THE BUDGET THAT WE HAVE PUT TOGETHER. I THINK THAT TOTHE EXTENT THAT WE SPEND THAT SURPLUS WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WE'RE SPENDING ON THINGS THAT ARE TRUE INVESTMENTS. IN CALIFORNIA AND BY INVESTMENT I MEAN A DOLLARS THAT YOU SPEND TODAY EQUALS LESS MONEY THAT YOU'LL HAVE TO SPEND IN THE FUTURE. AND I SHARE THE GOVERNOR'S CONCERNED ABOUT SPENDING MONEY THE CREEK CREATE SPENDING PRESSURE IN FUTURE. YEARS AND FOR FUTURE LEGISLATURE'S AND I'M AFRAID THAT WERE DOING TOO MUCH OF THAT. IN THIS BUDGET HIGH AND I HAVE OF ONE KIND OF OVERRIDING CONCERN. AND THAT IS THAT THE CREATION OF A THIRD. A BUDGET DEFICIT SAVINGS ACCOUNT A THIRD RESERVE ACCOUNT FOR. INVESTMENT IN SORT OF SOME OF THIS RESERVE. WE ALREADY HAVE TO BUDGET RESERVES ACCOUNTS THE. THE OLD RECALL THE RAINY DAY FUND THE BUDGET STABILIZATION ACCOUNT AND THE SPECIAL FUND FOR ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTIES AND ALTHOUGH THE BSA HAS A CAP THE SFE YOU DOES NOT HAVE A CAP. SO THE ONLY REASON TO CREATE A THIRD TYPE OF ACCOUNT. IS IF WE WANTED TO AVOID ON AUTOMATIC REDUCTION IN THE STATE SALES TAX. THAT'S THE ONLY CONSEQUENCE OF PUTTING MORE MONEY IN THE US AND FOR YOU. SO THE ONLY REASON FOR CREATING THAT THIRD ACCOUNT IS TO AVOID GIVING THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA BREAK ON THEIR SALES TAX AND I THINK A BRAKE IS BECAUSE APPROPRIATE IN AN ERA WHEN. A LOT OF OUR CONSTITUENTS ARE STRUGGLING TO AFFORD TO LIVE IN THE STATE THEM IN AN ERA WHEN THE STATE HAS A NINE BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET SURPLUS SO I'M GONNA CONTINUE TO ADVOCATE. THAT WE FUND THE SFE YOU INSTEAD OF CREATING A A THIRD TYPE OF RESERVE ACCOUNT THE BDS SAY. BUT I THINK IMMIGRANT MUCH MISTER CHAIR. GIVE US A VICE CHAIR. AGAIN JUST TO ECHO THE VICE YEARS COMIC JUST WANT TO THANK ALL THE BUDGET COMMITTEE MEMBERS WHO SAT THROUGH HOURS AND HOURS OF DELIBERATION. JUST WANTED TO THANK ALL THE STAFF MEMBERS WHO WORKED EXTRAORDINARILY HARD IN PUTTING THIS. PROPOSAL TOGETHER THE HOURS OF WORK THAT WENT INTO THAT. AS OF TODAY WE'VE HAD EIGHTY THREE HEARINGS ANOTHER TOYS DISCUSSION AS TO HOW MUCH DELIBERATION WE HAVE AS WE PUT TOGETHER. THIS. BUDGET PROPOSAL BUT EIGHTY THREE HEARINGS HOURS AND HOURS OF TESTIMONY THAT THE PUBLIC IS INVITED TO H. EACH AND EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THOSE AND. I GIVES THEIR CONSISTENT AND CONSTANT FEEDBACK EVEN NOW AS WE ARE ENTER INTO. BUDGET CONFERENCE COMMITTEE SO I DO WANT ALL IN PARTICULAR JUST RECOGNIZE THE FIVE. BUDGET SUB SHOOTERS WITHIN AN AMAZING JOB IN EACH OF THEIR AREAS VERY MUCH CRAFTING PROPOSALS WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEES TO COME UP WITH ALL THE DIFFERENT PIECES THAT WE HAVE PUT TOGETHER. SO FIRST WITH A TO START OFF WITH BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE ONE DOCTOR ARAMBULA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. IF I MAY I WANTED TO THANK THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE WITH ME FROM DOCTOR WOULD TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER RUBIO. TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER HARPER AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER MATHIS AS WELL AS TO OUR COMMITTEE STAFF ANDREA MARGOLIS AND THE CALL VASQUEZ. WE COULD NOT DO THIS WITHOUT YOU. pEIGHTEEN PUBLIC HEARINGS MANY LASTING MORE THAN JUST A FEW HOURS. AND WE HEARD FROM PEOPLE ALL ACROSS CALIFORNIA. ABOUT THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES NEED OF OUR GREAT STATE. RESPONDING TO THOSE NEEDS OUR SOMEONE TOOK THE FOLLOWING ACTIONS THIS YEAR. ON THE HEALTH SIDE OF SOMEONE. WE TURNED OUT THIS TURNED OUT TO BE A PRECEDENT SETTING YEAR FOR US. ABOUT WHICH MANY OF US SHOULD FEEL PROUD. FIRST AND FOREMOST WE MADE A VERY SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT IN HEALTH CARE. ONE BILLION DOLLARS. THIS INVESTMENT IS SIGNIFICANT IN SIZE OF COURSE BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY. IT IS SIGNIFICANT IN THAT IT MOVES THE STATE A LONG WAY TOWARDS UNIVERSAL COVERAGE. AND TOWARDS OUR GOAL OF MAKING HEALTH CARE TRULY ACCESSIBLE FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. OUR INVESTMENTADDRESSES THE FOLLOWING KEY CHALLENGES IN HEALTHCARE IN CALIFORNIA. FIRST EXPANSION OF COVERAGE. WE EXPAND COVERAGE IN SEVERAL WAYS THE MOST OF SIGNIFICANT IS. WE FIRST MAKE LOW ALL LOW INCOME YOUNG ADULT ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICAL. REGARDLESS OF IMMIGRATION STATUS. SECOND WE INCREASE ELIGIBILITY FOR THE AGED AND DISABLED TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY EIGHT PERCENT OF FEDERAL POVERTY. THE SAME LEVEL IT IS FOR YOUNGER PEOPLE. IN TERMS OF AFFORDABILITY OF HEALTH CARE. DESPITE THE SUBSTANTIAL GAINS IN HEALTH CARE COVERAGE IN REFORMS IN OUR STATE AND NATION. INSURANCE REMAINS ON AFFORDABLE TO MANY MIDDLE INCOME CALIFORNIANS. EVEN LEADING SOME TO CHOOSE TO BE UNINSURED. IN SOMEONE WE INVESTED OVER HALF A BILLION DOLLARS INTO PROVIDING PREMIUM ASSISTANCE TO PEOPLE. BETWEEN TWO HUNDRED AND SIX HUNDRED PERCENT OF FEDERAL POVERTY. FAMILIES SHOULD NOT HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE AND HOUSING. OR BETWEEN HEALTH CARE AND HUNGER. FINALLY SOMEONE'S INVESTMENT INCLUDES THE CREATION OF AN ALL PAYER CLAIMS DATABASE. TO COLLECT COST DATA MAKE IT TRANSPARENT AND LEAD US TOWARD COST CONTROLS. WE WOULD MAKE A SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENT IN OUR HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE AND UNDERSERVED MEDICAL SHORTAGE AREAS. OUTSIDE OF THE HEALTH CARE. EXPANSION REFORMS SOMEONE INVESTED FIFTY MILLION OF PROP FIFTY SIX REVENUES INTO MEDI CAL PROVIDER RATE INCREASES AND I LOOK FORWARD TO THE DISCUSSIONS FURTHER ON PROP FIFTY SIX. FINALLY WE MADE UNPRECEDENTED AND EXCITING INVESTMENTS IN PUBLIC HEALTH WITH OVER SIXTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ON PREVENTION EFFORTS FOR STDS. OPIOID OVERDOSE HIV AIDS. DIABETES HEPATITIS C. AND VALLEY FEVER. IT HAS BEEN AN HONOR AND A PRIVILEGE TO LEAD THE ASSEMBLY'S DECISION MAKING ON INVESTMENTS IN HEALTHCARE AND PUBLIC HEALTH. HOPEFULLY SETTING THE STAGE FOR A HEALTHIER CALIFORNIA. NOW ON TO HUMAN SERVICES SIDE OF OUR WORK FOR SOMEONE. WE APPROVED THE ELIMINATION OF THE SSI CASH OUT FOR SS I SS P. RECIPIENTS. HOLDING HARMLESS THE CURRENT CASELOAD. WHICH WILL EXPAND FOOD BENEFITS FOR OVER FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND S. S. P. HOUSEHOLDS. WE BUILT UPON THE GOVERNOR'S INITIATIVE ON THE CREATION OF A HOME VISITING PROGRAMS FOR PARENTS AND THEIR INFANTS AND TODDLERS WHO WERE LIVING IN POVERTY. EXPANDING THE POPULATION ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE SERVICE AND MAKING THE PROGRAM PERMANENT WITHIN CAL WORKS. WE KNOW THAT THIS HOME VISITING PROGRAM CHANGES THE LIVES OF PARTICIPATING FAMILIES FOR THE BETTER. WITH VITAL HEALTH AND POSITIVE DEVELOPMENT OUTCOMES FOR YOUNG CHILDREN. IN THE AREA OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES WE FUNDED A FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR BRIDGE PROGRAM TO AMELIORATE FISCAL DISTRESS BEING FELT BY DD PROVIDERS LOCATED IN AREAS OF THE STATE WITH HIGH LABOR COSTS. WE PUT TWELVE POINT SIX MILLION INTO EMERGENCY FOOD DISTRIBUTION. TO AID WITH HUNGER RELIEF THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA AND PROVIDED TWENTY FIVE MILLION FOR SORELY NEEDED INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS AT FOOD BANKS AND PANTRIES. WE FUNDED THE MEALS ON WHEELS AND CONGREGATE NUTRITION WITH AN ADDITIONAL TEN MILLION. AND SUSTAINED THIS AND PROVIDED SEVEN POINT THREE MILLION FOR LONG TERM CARE OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM. WE PROVIDED ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR IMMIGRATION SERVICES WITH PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO RECIPIENTS OF THE TEMPORARY pGEOGRAPHIC AREAS IN NEED OF SERVICE CAPACITY AND DETAINEES IN IMMIGRATION COURT. IN THE FOSTER CARE AREA WE PROVIDED FUNDING TO CREATE A FAMILY URGENT RESPONSE SYSTEM. TO GIVE SUPPORT AND COUNSELING TO CAREGIVERS AND CURRENT OR FORMER FOSTER CHILDREN OR YOUTH AND WE BACKFILLED A REDUCTION TO THE VITAL FOSTER PARENT RETENTION RECRUITMENT AND SUPPORT PROGRAM. LASTLY WE PROVIDED MODEST ONGOING FUNDING TO MEET THE NEEDS IN THE DEAF ACCESS PROGRAM AND FOR THE INDIAN HEALTH CLINICS AND ONE TIME SUPPORT FOR DIAPER DISTRIBUTION. HOLOCAUST SURVIVOR ASSISTANCE AND YOUTH AND FAMILY CIVIC ENGAGEMENT. THOSE ARE THE INVESTMENTS THAT SOMEONE CHOSE TO TAKE. TOWARDS THE CRAFTING OF THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN STATE BUDGET.

GREAT THANK YOU MS CHAVEZ. SEEING NO OTHER QUESTIONS PLEASE COSTA DID YOU HAVE ANY COMMENT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN STERN VICE CHAIR MEMBERS IN THE COST OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. WE WOULD LIKE TO CAUTION. AGAINST THE ARCHITECTURE OF THE ASSEMBLIES PROPOSED BUDGET MOSTLY ON THE REVENUE FORECAST SIDE OF THE EQUATION. THE BUDGET PROPOSED BEFORE YOU UTILIZES THE ALEJO REVENUES WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE CORPORATION TAX REVENUES AND THE IMPACT OF THAT IS THAT THE REVENUES OR TWO POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS ABOVE THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISION. PROPOSAL. OFFER A VARIETY OF REASONS WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT THESE REVENUE PROJECTION SHOULD BE ADOPTED AS PART OF THE BUDGET. MUCH OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OUR BUDGET. AYE AYE PARDON ME ARE REVENUE FORECAST IN THE ANALYST AND HAVE TO DO WITH THE PERSONAL INCOME TAX AND CAPITAL GAINS BOTH OF WHICH ARE VERY DIFFICULT TO PREDICT AN EXTREMELY VOLATILE. ON THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE ALEJO REVENUE FORECASTS ARE IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT THEY BOTH ARE ACTUALLY PRESUMING CONTINUED ECONOMIC GROWTH. ALTHOUGH THE ADMINISTRATION'S AT A SLOWER CLIP I AM EVEN THAT HAS SOME OF US NERVOUS A WE ARE REACHING. THE POINT OF OUR ECONOMIC EXPANSION BEING ONE OF THE LONGEST IN HISTORY. AND AS SUCH WE THINK ON THAT THERE ARE MANY RISKS ON THE HORIZON. THE LA OH FORECAST RELIES ON THE GROWTH RATES THAT ARE OUTSIDE OF HISTORIC AVERAGES. THEIR SEEMING HIGHER GROWTH RATES IN WAGES PARTICULARLY PARTICULARLY IN TWENTY NINETEEN WITH THE GROWTH RATE OF SIX POINT SEVEN PERCENT WHICH WOULD BE TO PERCENT ANA ABOVE FINANCES AND ABOVE WHAT WE'VE SEEN HISTORICALLY. BOTH THE ADMINISTRATION AND ALEJO ARE ASSUMING ROBUST GROWTH AND CAP GAINS IN A FOR TWENTY SEVENTEEN THAT WOULD BE A TWENTY PERCENT GROWTH FACTOR FOR FINANCE AND THIRTY SIX PERCENT FOR THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. ON THE LA OF CAPITAL GAINS IS HIGHER THAN THE ADMINISTRATION'S. IN SEVENTEEN AND EIGHTEEN AT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY BILLION AND A HUNDRED AND SIXTY BILLION. VERSUS FINANCES ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE BILLION AND ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY BILLION. FOR CONTACTS OTHER CAPITAL GAINS ON THE LAST REPORTED LEVEL I. HIGHEST LEVEL AND TWO THOUSAND SEVEN WITH A HUNDRED AND THIRTY TWO BILLION SO THAT GIVES YOU A LITTLE BIT OF CONTACTS ABOUT THE GROWTH. THAT FRANKLY WERE BOTH PROJECTING. THE LA US GROWTH ASSUMPTION FROM POINT IT AND BREAK LATE WAGES WILL MORE LIKELY LEAD TO IMBALANCES AND RAISE THE RISK OF RECESSION IN FUTURE YEARS. LASTLY WE VIEW MUCH OF THE GROWTH THAT WE'RE SEEING IN CAP GAINS IN THE PERSONAL INCOME TAXES ONE TIME IN NATURE A DRIVEN IN PART BY THE FEDERAL TAX REFORM ON PEOPLE GETTING BONUSES AND CASHING OUT THINGS THAT WE DON'T THINK WE'LL AYE EQUATE INTO A TREND LINE LONG. TERM. I WE WOULD NOTE THAT A WE SUPPORT THE ASSEMBLIES. PROPOSAL TO ADOPT ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL TO FULLY FUND THE RAINY DAY FUND OF WE'VE OFTEN TESTIFIED ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF PROTECTING AGAINST THE NEXT RECESSION AND. ONE KEY TOOL IS TO FULLY FUND THE RAINY DAY FUND. WE BELIEVE THAT A ROBUST RESERVE COUPLED WITH LIMITED ONGOING EXPENDITURES WILL BE THE KEY TO WEATHERING THE NEXT. RECESSION THAT WILL INEVITABLY HIT THE STATE. A NEW ON GOING SPENDING FOR EXAMPLE AN EXPANDED HEALTH CARE ACCESS WILL CREATE ADDITIONAL PRESSURES FOR THE STATE OUT WHEN WE ARE FACED WITH THE RECESSION WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU MISS COSTA. SEEING NO QUESTIONS COULD I ASK FOR A MOTION AND A SECOND TO APPROVED BUDGET SOME.
