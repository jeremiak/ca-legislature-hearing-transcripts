SO- YOU KNOW PERHAPS THE

01:39:24.358 --> 01:39:24.858
RESOLUTION WOULD HAVE BEEN A

01:39:24.925 --> 01:39:26.193
WAY TO START THE PROCESS. EIGHT

01:39:26.260 --> 01:39:27.995
YEARS AGO- BUT UNFORTUNATELY

01:39:28.062 --> 01:39:29.330
WE'RE HAVING DISCUSS ABOUT THE

01:39:29.396 --> 01:39:31.298
LONG OF PRO. WHITE WAS CREE THE

01:39:31.365 --> 01:39:33.000
OF HUMAN DIGNITY AND WHAT IT

01:39:33.067 --> 01:39:34.935
SAYS ABOUT HUMAN DIGNITY AND

01:39:35.002 --> 01:39:36.370
THE FACT THAT IF WE VALUE WORK

01:39:36.437 --> 01:39:37.571
IN IN AN ECONOMY WHERE WE'RE

01:39:37.638 --> 01:39:39.373
TOLD THAT THERE AREN'T ENOUGH

WE SHOULD AT LEAST PAY

EVERYBODY MINIMUM WAGE SO I

01:39:48.115 --> 01:39:49.817
VALUE ANY WORK THAT ANY

01:39:49.883 --> 01:39:51.352
INDIVIDUAL DOES AND I THINK

01:39:51.418 --> 01:39:52.953
THAT WE HAVE A MINIMUM WAGE SO

01:39:53.020 --> 01:39:55.189
THAT EVERY INDIVIDUAL. CAN

01:39:55.255 --> 01:39:56.323
UTILIZE THAT SO THANK YOU FOR

01:39:56.390 --> 01:39:58.392
DO I THINK THIS IS- A CIVIL

01:39:58.459 --> 01:40:02.329
RIGHTS AND- ISSUE THAT HAS BEEN

01:40:02.396 --> 01:40:05.132
NEGLECTED FOR FAR TOO LONG.

01:40:05.199 --> 01:40:08.202
THANK YOU ANY OTHER COMMENT NO

01:40:08.268 --> 01:40:16.176
QUESTION. OKAY WELL YES PLEASE.

SOME WHEN I LOOK THROUGH- THE

01:40:20.013 --> 01:40:23.417
BILL UNDER THE THAT IS I TO

01:40:23.484 --> 01:40:23.984
FELT THAT THE WAS SOMETHING

01:40:24.051 --> 01:40:26.787
THAT- WAS LONG OVER. BUT I HAVE

01:40:26.854 --> 01:40:28.088

TO THE TEST OF MISTER LONDON I

01:40:30.190 --> 01:40:31.258
DO BELIEVE THAT THAT'S

01:40:31.325 --> 01:40:33.260
SOMETHING THAT. THE FACT THAT

01:40:33.327 --> 01:40:35.629
HE HAS THIS HISTORY. IT ISN'T

01:40:35.696 --> 01:40:37.131
AS THOUGH HE'S JUST COMING IN

01:40:37.197 --> 01:40:38.432
AND SPEAKING ABOUT SOMETHING HE

01:40:38.499 --> 01:40:40.367
HAS NO EXPERIENCE ABOUT- NO

01:40:40.434 --> 01:40:43.437
KNOWLEDGE ABOUT. IT HE'S HE'S

01:40:43.504 --> 01:40:44.138
LIVED WITH THAT WITH HIS CHILD

01:40:44.204 --> 01:40:45.739
ALSO I THINK THAT THAT'S

01:40:45.806 --> 01:40:48.709
SOMETHING THAT HAS VALUE TO ME.

01:40:48.776 --> 01:40:52.212
AND I THINK THAT- THE COMMENT

01:40:52.279 --> 01:40:53.113
FROM THE OTHER. WITNESS IN

01:40:53.180 --> 01:40:54.948
OPPOSITION ABOUT THE PERIOD OF

01:40:55.015 --> 01:40:58.285
TIME. TO TRANSITION. THE LAST

01:40:58.352 --> 01:41:00.554
THING I WANT IS FOR PEOPLE TO

01:41:00.621 --> 01:41:02.089
LOSE THEIR JOBS AND TO LOSE THE

01:41:02.156 --> 01:41:03.824
OPPORTUNITIES. BUT I DO WANT

01:41:03.891 --> 01:41:04.658
THEM TO BE PAID AT LEAST

01:41:04.725 --> 01:41:07.327
MINIMUM WAGE. SO I JUST THOUGHT

01:41:07.394 --> 01:41:09.163
I'D KNOW THAT. AT EVERY STEP OF

01:41:09.229 --> 01:41:10.531
THE WAY YOU YOU WORK WITH

01:41:10.597 --> 01:41:12.800
OPPOSITION AND TRYING TO FIND.

01:41:12.866 --> 01:41:14.768
THE BEST WAY TO MAKE SURE THAT.

01:41:14.835 --> 01:41:17.271
IN THE END IT IS A PROGRAM THAT

01:41:17.337 --> 01:41:19.740
WILL BE EFFECTIVE ON THE DATE

01:41:19.807 --> 01:41:20.374
THAT WE SAY THAT IT'S GOING TO

01:41:20.441 --> 01:41:23.610
BE EFFECTIVE. AND THAT WOULD BE

01:41:23.677 --> 01:41:24.211
MY ONLY COMMENT ON THIS THANK

01:59:38.704 --> 01:59:40.907
OF THIS PROBLEM GREATER THAN

01:59:40.973 --> 01:59:42.575
OUR LARGEST PORTS. THEIR

01:59:42.642 --> 01:59:44.176
EXPLOITATION IS THE DOMINANT

01:59:44.243 --> 01:59:46.045
ECONOMIC MODEL. TRUCKING

NEGOTIABLE RIGHT. IT'S NOT

02:00:03.329 --> 02:00:05.197
UNCOMMON TO HAVE MONTHS WHERE

02:00:05.264 --> 02:00:06.499
THE COST OF MAINTAINING THE

02:00:06.566 --> 02:00:09.502

02:00:11.504 --> 02:00:13.139

THE REAL WAY TO TACKLE THIS

02:01:01.587 --> 02:01:02.888

02:15:29.054 --> 02:15:30.589
THIS DEALS WITH SPECIFIC CASES

WHERE. AN EMPLOYER WITH

02:15:31.857 --> 02:15:34.059

THE LAW AND ALL OF THOSE

02:15:34.926 --> 02:15:36.394
LOCATIONS AT ONCE. IT JUST

02:15:36.461 --> 02:15:37.963
STREAMLINES THE PROCESS OF

SETTING UP A PORTER IN A WAY

02:15:39.297 --> 02:15:40.765
THAT. WE BELIEVE IS VERY FAIR

02:15:40.832 --> 02:15:42.133
AND JUDICIOUS ESPECIALLY TO

02:15:42.200 --> 02:15:43.935
EMPLOYERS THAT. DON'T HAVE A

02:15:44.002 --> 02:15:45.871
BLANKET WORKER SAFETY POLICY

02:15:45.937 --> 02:15:47.706
ACROSS ALL OF THOSE LOCATIONS.

02:15:47.772 --> 02:15:48.840
THEY ALSO ESTABLISHES THE

02:15:48.907 --> 02:15:50.876
CATEGORY OF EGREGIOUS CITATIONS

02:15:50.942 --> 02:15:52.210
THAT. THE AUTHOR DID A GREAT

02:15:52.277 --> 02:15:54.112
JOB OF EXPLAINING. JUST WANTED

02:15:54.179 --> 02:15:56.181
TO SPECIFY THE LOCAL CITATIONS

02:15:56.248 --> 02:15:57.415
RIGHT NOW ALREADY HAPPENED

ABOUT TWO OR THREE TIMES PER

02:15:58.917 --> 02:16:00.352
YEAR. AND THIS WOULD BE A

02:16:00.418 --> 02:16:02.087
SUBSET OF THOSE. SO THEY BE

02:16:02.153 --> 02:16:04.055
EXTRAORDINARILY RARE ONLY USED

02:16:04.122 --> 02:16:05.690
IN THE WORST OF THE WORST CASES

02:16:05.757 --> 02:16:08.159
IF EVER. AND IT ALSO CLARIFIES

02:16:08.226 --> 02:16:09.628
THAT. HELLO SHOULD HAVE THE

02:16:09.694 --> 02:16:11.429
OPTION OF CITING VIOLATIONS OF

02:16:11.496 --> 02:16:13.231
THE LABOR CODE. SO RIGHT NOW IN

02:16:13.298 --> 02:16:15.367
THE LEGISLATURE PASSES THE BILL

02:16:15.433 --> 02:16:16.067
RELATING TO WORKER HEALTH AND

02:16:16.134 --> 02:16:17.869
SAFETY. THERE'S REALLY NO ONE

02:16:17.936 --> 02:16:19.604
THERE TO ENFORCE IT AND SO THIS

02:16:19.671 --> 02:16:21.473

TO MAKE IT WORK- THE VERY

03:17:21.629 --> 03:17:23.531
FOUNDATION OF THIS BILL IS

03:17:23.598 --> 03:17:25.667
BUILT OFF A CONCEPT OF PAYROLL

03:17:25.733 --> 03:17:28.469
REVIEW BEING CONDUCTED. OF OUR

03:17:42.717 --> 03:17:44.652

FUNDAMENTAL TO MAKING THIS BILL

03:17:57.465 --> 03:17:59.200

PORTION OF THE INDUSTRY ALREADY

03:28:52.519 --> 03:28:55.289
REALIZE THAT- WE DO PRODUCE A

03:28:55.356 --> 03:28:57.591
LOT OF OIL AND GAS IN THE STATE

03:28:57.658 --> 03:28:59.026
AND THAT. THE PEOPLE WORKING

THAT IS THAT WE'RE DOING- WE'RE

03:58:21.053 --> 03:58:22.354
TALKING ABOUT RECIDIVISM AND

03:58:22.421 --> 03:58:27.626
YET WE HAVE. AB 830% POPULATION

03:58:27.693 --> 03:58:29.094
WHERE PEOPLE THAT USED TO BE IN

03:58:29.161 --> 03:58:31.697
PRISON CAN ACTUALLY GO. GET A

03:58:31.764 --> 03:58:35.801
JOB. AND ACTUALLY. TAKE CARE OF

03:58:35.868 --> 03:58:39.038
THEIR LIVES. REYES FAMILIES GET

03:58:39.104 --> 03:58:44.810
STRAIGHT N. AND STAY THAT WAY-

03:58:44.877 --> 03:58:46.478
MINORITY POPULATIONS WHO

03:58:46.545 --> 03:58:47.746

BE ABLE TO FOR THEM TO DO THAT

03:59:02.094 --> 03:59:03.562

03:59:23.582 --> 03:59:25.718
LOST LIFE- IN OUR PIPELINE

03:59:25.784 --> 03:59:28.353
SYSTEM- I KNOW YOU'RE LOOKING

03:59:28.420 --> 03:59:30.956
AT THE INDUSTRY WIDE DATA BUT

03:59:31.023 --> 03:59:32.591
YOU KNOW I WENT THROUGH THE

03:59:32.658 --> 03:59:35.160
EARLY SO CANYON GHASTLY CAN HAD

03:59:35.227 --> 03:59:35.761
TWENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE POISON

03:59:35.828 --> 03:59:37.229
IN MY BACKYARD AND PEOPLE ARE

03:59:37.296 --> 03:59:39.631
STILL DEALING WITH ALL KINDS OF

03:59:39.698 --> 03:59:42.301
INCIDENTS FROM- INADEQUATE

03:59:42.367 --> 03:59:44.803
MAINTENANCE- AND A LACK OF

03:59:44.870 --> 03:59:46.038
COMMITMENT ON THE SAFETY SIDE

03:59:46.105 --> 03:59:49.274
SO AND I THINK THE CONSEQUENCES

03:59:49.341 --> 03:59:51.510
ARE REAL AND- THAT THE BIGGEST

03:59:51.577 --> 03:59:52.811
PROBLEM IS WHEN YOU'RE

03:59:52.878 --> 03:59:54.413
SUBCONTRACTING OUT AND YOU'RE

03:59:54.480 --> 03:59:55.714
NOT USING YOUR NOT PAYING

03:59:55.781 --> 03:59:57.583
PEOPLE PREVAILING WAGE. WHICH

03:59:57.649 --> 03:59:58.617
YOU CAN HEAR FROM THE GOOD

03:59:58.684 --> 03:59:59.618
TESTIMONY OF FOLKS WHO ARE

03:59:59.685 --> 04:00:01.587
PAYING PAYING THOSE WAGES BUT

04:00:01.653 --> 04:00:03.822
THERE'S A LOT OF SUB STANDARD-

04:00:03.889 --> 04:00:05.424
PAYMENTS GOING ON OUT THERE AND

04:00:05.491 --> 04:00:08.260
SO- IT'S NOT SO MUCH THAT-

04:00:08.327 --> 04:00:09.495
WE'RE SEEKING A PROBLEM WE'RE

04:00:09.561 --> 04:00:11.263
TRYING TO SORT IT UP LIFT ALL

04:00:11.330 --> 04:00:12.965
THOSE SEVENTEEN THOUSAND

04:00:13.031 --> 04:00:14.633
WORKERS IT'S NOT NOT TRYING TO

04:00:14.700 --> 04:00:16.301
SEND AN INDUSTRY ELSEWHERE

04:00:16.368 --> 04:00:17.369
WE'VE BEEN WORRIED ABOUT THE

04:00:17.436 --> 04:00:18.670
TURNAROUND JOBS COMING IN FROM

04:00:18.737 --> 04:00:20.339
OUT OF STATE AND WE'RE WORRIED

04:00:20.405 --> 04:00:22.274
THAT AMONG SO SEVENTEEN

04:00:22.341 --> 04:00:22.841
THOUSAND IF THEY DON'T HAVE

04:00:22.908 --> 04:00:24.076
STABLE EMPLOYMENT AND THEY'RE

04:00:24.143 --> 04:00:26.178
GONNA SUBCONTRACTED JOB TO JOB

04:00:26.245 --> 04:00:27.279
AND THEY'RE NOT BEING PRIVY TO

04:00:27.346 --> 04:00:28.313
PAY PREVAILING WAGE DRIVE

04:00:28.380 --> 04:00:29.948
ACCESS TO LONG TERM BENEFITS OR

04:00:30.015 --> 04:00:31.550
PENSION OR RETIREMENT. THEN

04:00:31.617 --> 04:00:33.051
THEY'RE GOING TO THEY'RE GOING

04:00:33.118 --> 04:00:34.052
TO RISE AND FALL DEPENDING ON

04:00:34.119 --> 04:00:36.021
WHAT OPEC OR PUTIN DOES AND I

04:00:36.088 --> 04:00:37.689
DON'T THINK THAT'S A SAFE WAY

04:00:37.756 --> 04:00:39.558
TO SET THAT WHOLE SECTOR

04:00:39.625 --> 04:00:41.193
WORKERS UP FOR SUCCESS SO THIS

04:00:41.260 --> 04:00:42.461
IS THIS IS REALLY SUPPOSED TO

04:00:42.528 --> 04:00:48.333
STABILIZE- MAN ASSIST. NOT NOT

04:00:48.400 --> 04:00:50.803
TO BE- AN IMPEDIMENT. IF YOU'RE-

04:00:50.869 --> 04:00:53.572
THANK YOU THANK. YES KEEP HER

04:00:53.639 --> 04:00:54.306
BRING IT FOR IT I THINK M. YOU

04:00:54.373 --> 04:00:55.274
SAID EXACT WHAT I UNDERSTOOD

04:00:55.340 --> 04:00:56.909
THE PURPOSE OF OUR PORTIONS OF

04:00:56.975 --> 04:00:57.976
THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL TO BE

04:00:58.043 --> 04:01:00.312
AND THAT IS- TO UP LIFT A GROUP

04:01:00.379 --> 04:01:02.848
OF WORKERS WHO MAY NOT HAVE HAD

04:01:02.915 --> 04:01:04.583
THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR

04:01:04.650 --> 04:01:06.151
APPRENTICESHIPS OR TRAINING IN

04:01:06.218 --> 04:01:08.020
THE PAST TO BE ABLE THEN OVER

04:01:08.086 --> 04:01:09.388
THIS PERIOD TIME TO GET THOSE

04:01:09.454 --> 04:01:11.290
AND THAT DOES HELP ACTUALLY NOT

04:01:11.356 --> 04:01:12.925
JUST WITH THESE WORKERS BUT- AS

04:01:12.991 --> 04:01:14.760
WE LOOK FORWARD TO A JUST

04:01:14.827 --> 04:01:16.762
TRANSITION. IF WE LOOK AT WHAT

04:01:16.829 --> 04:01:18.730
WILL HAPPEN TO A WORK FORCE AS

04:01:18.797 --> 04:01:21.233
SOME OF THESE JOBS. MAY BE

04:01:21.300 --> 04:01:22.868
PHASED OUT AND WHERE THEY GO

04:01:22.935 --> 04:01:24.536
AND BE HAVING THAT ADDITIONAL

04:01:24.603 --> 04:01:25.404
TRAINING SOME OF THEM WHAT

04:01:25.470 --> 04:01:26.772
WOULD NEED ADDITIONAL TRAINING

04:01:26.839 --> 04:01:28.440
PROBABLY HAVING THAT-

04:01:28.507 --> 04:01:30.442

AND JUST LIKE IN CONSTRUCTION-

04:01:44.389 --> 04:01:45.891

04:13:05.169 --> 04:13:07.205
MYSTIFYING TO US WHY THE AUTHOR

04:13:07.272 --> 04:13:09.807
IS NOT EVEN BEING ABLE TO JUST

04:13:09.874 --> 04:13:11.910

TRANSGENDER PEOPLE AND PEOPLE

LIVING WITH A DISABILITY WOULD

04:14:42.600 --> 04:14:43.768

APPRECIATE OUR VETERANS BUT THE

04:15:42.360 --> 04:15:43.127
BETTER WAY IS TO CHECK WITH

04:18:44.442 --> 04:18:50.715

A COUPLE OF THINGS BOB. THERE

04:18:56.787 --> 04:19:00.458
THERE. THE ARGUMENT THAT THIS

04:19:00.524 --> 04:19:03.027
IS BASICALLY ILLEGAL- IS

04:19:03.094 --> 04:19:04.562
REFUTED BY THE FACT THOSE

04:19:04.629 --> 04:19:05.463
THIRTY NINE OTHER STATES THAT

04:19:05.529 --> 04:19:06.864
HAVE JUST THE SAME KIND OF

04:19:06.931 --> 04:19:08.466
PREFERENCE FOR VETERANS FIFTY

04:19:08.532 --> 04:19:10.501

04:19:10.568 --> 04:19:11.435
THEIR GOVERNMENT AND THE

04:19:11.502 --> 04:19:13.404
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT- I WOULD

04:19:13.471 --> 04:19:15.539
EXPECT THAT THAT THE FOLKS WHO

04:19:15.606 --> 04:19:17.508
ARE OPPOSED WOULD SUGGEST WE

04:19:17.575 --> 04:19:19.644
ROLL BACK THOSE BENEFITS THOSE

04:19:19.710 --> 04:19:21.612
PROTECTIONS AS WELL THERE'S A

04:19:21.679 --> 04:19:23.047
DISPARATE IMPACT IN AND THAT

04:19:23.114 --> 04:19:24.649
UNFORTUNATELY IS NOT SOMETHING

04:19:24.715 --> 04:19:26.984
WE CAN GET PAST OF THE MILITARY

04:19:27.051 --> 04:19:28.886
HAS A DISPROPORTIONATE NUMBER

04:19:28.953 --> 04:19:30.054
OF LATINOS COMPARED TO THE

04:19:30.121 --> 04:19:31.589
GENERAL POPULATION MILITARY IS

04:19:31.656 --> 04:19:32.556
A DISPROPORTIONATE NUMBER OF

04:19:32.623 --> 04:19:34.525
AFRICAN AMERICANS. AS COMPARED

04:19:34.592 --> 04:19:35.326

THE MILITARY AS A

04:19:36.193 --> 04:19:38.162
DISPROPORTIONATE NUMBER OF POOR

04:19:38.229 --> 04:19:39.096
PEOPLE AS COMPARED TO THE

04:19:39.163 --> 04:19:40.698
GENERAL POPULATION THERE ARE

04:19:40.765 --> 04:19:42.500
LITERALLY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS

ENERGETIC AND THE THEATRES

REALLY OPEN THEIR HOUSE TO KIDS

04:25:44.895 --> 04:25:46.597
THAT WERE SOMEWHAT LOST AND

04:25:46.664 --> 04:25:48.132
WANTED TO JUST THE PLACE TO BE

04:25:48.198 --> 04:25:50.834
TO BE CREATIVE. AND ALSO SERVE

04:25:50.901 --> 04:25:53.037
AS INCUBATORS SOME OF OUR KIDS

04:25:53.103 --> 04:25:54.271
IN OUR INNER CITY COMMUNITIES

04:25:54.338 --> 04:25:56.640

04:25:58.742 --> 04:26:00.944
AND STILL THAT GAVE THEM THE

04:26:01.011 --> 04:26:02.646
PLATFORM AND THE ABILITY TO

04:26:02.713 --> 04:26:03.781
PRACTICE AND HONE IN THEIR

ONTO BETTER BIGGER THINGS- I

04:26:09.320 --> 04:26:10.454
WANTED TO ALSO HIGHLIGHT THAT

04:26:10.521 --> 04:26:13.023
THIS IS NOT JUST. ABOUT

04:26:13.090 --> 04:26:14.391
PERFORMING ARTS BUT IT'S REALLY

04:26:14.458 --> 04:26:16.493
IS ABOUT EQUITY IN ACCESS AND

04:26:16.560 --> 04:26:19.129
SOCIAL JUSTICE HISTORICALLY

04:26:19.196 --> 04:26:20.664
THEATER HAS BEEN USED TO

04:26:20.731 --> 04:26:22.433
HIGHLIGHT ISSUES OF IMPORTANCE

04:26:22.499 --> 04:26:24.268
TO CERTAIN COMMUNITIES. FOR

04:26:24.335 --> 04:26:26.203
EXAMPLE IF THE OTHER COMPASS HE

04:26:26.270 --> 04:26:28.839
NOW USED ARTS THEATER TO REALLY

04:26:28.906 --> 04:26:32.142
MOBILIZE THE ARM FARMWORKERS

AND TO HELP THEM FIGHT FOR

04:26:33.544 --> 04:26:35.245
BETTER WORKING CONDITIONS. IT

04:26:35.312 --> 04:26:37.014
IS INDISPUTABLE THAT PERFORMING

04:26:37.081 --> 04:26:38.182
ARTS GO HAND IN HAND WITH

04:26:38.248 --> 04:26:39.350
SOCIAL MOVEMENTS AND PLAY A

04:26:39.416 --> 04:26:41.051
CRITICAL ROLE AND SOCIAL

SEVENTEEN YEARS I CAN'T SAY

04:26:52.062 --> 04:26:53.964
ARE DISAPPEARING IN OUR SCHOOLS

04:26:54.031 --> 04:26:56.633
AND BE THEATERS. AND COMMUNITY

04:26:56.700 --> 04:26:59.403
NONPROFITS ARE REALLY SUCH A

04:26:59.470 --> 04:27:01.171
GREAT PARTNER STROLLER SCHOOLS

04:27:01.238 --> 04:27:02.206
THEY CONTINUE TO INVITE OUR

04:27:02.272 --> 04:27:04.908
CLASSROOMS IN. GIVE CLASSES IN

04:27:04.975 --> 04:27:06.643
REALLY EMBRACE THOSE KIDS THAT

04:27:06.710 --> 04:27:07.745
OTHERWISE WOULD NOT HAVE AN

04:27:07.811 --> 04:27:09.980
OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE ACCESS TO

04:27:10.047 --> 04:27:13.517

04:27:13.584 --> 04:27:16.186
