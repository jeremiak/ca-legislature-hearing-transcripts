CALIFORNIA STATE SENATE COMMITTEE. ON ENERGY UTILITIES AND COMMUNICATIONS. WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO START AS A SUBCOMMITTEE OF THE COMMITTEE TO HEAR. TESTIMONY ON SOME OF THE BILLS WILL GET RIGHT STARTED ALL OF YOU HERE ARE ON TIME THERE'S NO REASON WHY WE CAN'T. START ON TIME. OF WILL BEGIN -- DO WE HAVE ANY PRISONERS HERE. SIR BRADFORD HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT PRESENTING HER. WONDERFUL CLEAVE WONDERFULLY CRAFTED BILL. I'M CENTER OKAY WITH A STARTING RIGHT NOW. GOOD MORNING MR WHAT YOUR HEART WELL I I'M GOING TO START WITH SB [inaudible] ONE FIVE FIVE ALL RIGHT. SB ONE FIVE FIVE IS A SIMPLE MEASURE THAT IMPROVES TO EXISTING STATE ENERGY PROGRAM TO ENSURE ACCOUNTABILITY OF ALL ENERGY PROVIDERS I'M. HERE TO ACCEPT THE CAN COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS AND I THANK THE GERMAN AND STAFF FOR WORKING TO THIS POINT. AS YOU HEARD REPEATEDLY PROCUREMENT IS BECOMING LESS RELIABLE MORE COMPLICATED GREATER UNCERTAINTY DEMANDS MORE NOT LESS ACCOUNTABILITY. OF ALL PARTIES SB ONE FIVE FIVE DOES NOT CREATE ANY NEW REQUIREMENTS JUST PROVIDES BETTER ACCOUNTABILITY IT'S SIMPLY SHORES EXISTING RULES. ARE FOLLOWED SO THE STATE CAN ASSESS OUR PS COMPLIANCE IN A TIMELY WAY. RELIABILITY PLANNING INCLUDES MULTI MULTI YEAR RESOURCE ADEQUACY. AND PROCUREMENT PLANNING INCLUDES EXISTING OF LONG TERM CONTRACT PROCUREMENT -- FROM SB THREE FIFTY IN. TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN WE'RE JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT -- BY VICE BY THE RULES WITH ME TODAY IS MATT FRIEDMAN FROM TURN AND COLIN. QUESTION ANY FROM SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. YES THANK YOU OF A COMMITTEE FOR A HAVING HERE CHAIRMAN I HUESO MY NAME IS COLIN CASH THE ON THE VICE PRESIDENT SO I CALIFORNIA'S AND RESPONSIBLE FOR A POWER SUPPLY. CALIFORNIA MUST CAREFULLY PLANNED FOR IT'S A CLEAN ENERGY FUTURE TO ENSURE THAT ELECTRICITY SERVICES RELIABLE AND AFFORDABLE FOR ALL CUSTOMERS. TO DO THIS WE NEED TO HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE AND INTEGRATED PLAN. THAT IS APPLICABLE TO ALL THOSE CERVANTES WHICH INCLUDES THE UTILITIES THE ENERGY SERVICE PROVIDERS AND COMMUNITY CHOICE AGGREGATORS. AS WE REDUCE OUR RELIANCE ON FOSSIL FIRED FUELS AND INCREASE OUR RELIANCE ON RENEWABLE AND CLEAN ENERGY. WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE A LOT OF THIS CLEAN AND RENEWABLE ENERGY HAS LIMITATIONS ON HOW IT CAN OPERATE. THEREFORE IT'S GONNA BE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE CENTRALLY PLANNED. AND HOLD ALL LOW SERVING ENTITIES ACCOUNTABLE. FOR WHAT IS BILL. WHERE DOES BILL AND WHEN IT IS BUILT? SB THREE FIFTY CREDIT IN INTEGRATED RESOURCE PLANNING PROCESS REFER TO AS THE I. R. P.. TO ACCOMPLISH THIS TASK. HOWEVER CCA'S INDIA'S PIECE WHICH WILL SOON BE MORE THAN HALF OF THE CPC'S JURISDICTIONAL LOAD. HAS BEEN LARGELY RESISTANT TO HAVING THEIR IRP RESULTS DIRECTLY REGULATED BY THE CPUC. AND THIS IS AN UNTENABLE POSITION. CALIFORNIA'S ELECTRIC GRID NEEDS TO BE PLANNED FOR HER THOUGHTFUL. AND COMPREHENSIVE MANNER AND IT WILL FAIL IF DOZENS OF ALICE SEES CAN OPERATE INDEPENDENT OF GREAT NEEDS. THEREFORE SO I CALIFORNIA'S IN VERY MUCH SUPPORTS SB ONE FIFTY FIVE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MATT FRIEDMAN REPRESENTING THE UTILITY REFORM NETWORK IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. I'M SB ONE FIFTY FIVE WOULD SIMPLY AUGMENT THE ABILITY AND THE AUTHORITY OF THE CALIFORNIA PC TO OVERSEE COMPLIANCE WITH THE RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STANDARD AND INTEGRATED RESOURCES PLANNING PROGRAM OBJECTIVES. THE RAPID EXPANSION OF COMMUNITY CHOICE AGGREGATION AND THE EXPANSION OF DIRECT ACCESS THAT WAS AUTHORIZED LAST YEAR. ARE CREATING SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THE RETAIL MARKETS THAT ARE GONNA REQUIRE DILIGENT OVERSIGHT OF ALL RESOURCE PLANNING AND RELIABILITY BY STATE REGULATORS. ALL OF THESE ENTITIES ARE REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STANDARD PROGRAM TARGETS. THE P. YOU SEE HAS DONE VERY LITTLE HISTORICALLY TO REVIEW THE PROCUREMENT PLANS SUBMITTED BY LOAD SERVING ENTITIES OTHER THAN THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES. I'M IN ORDER TO DETERMINE -- WHETHER THESE PLANS ARE ADEQUATE AND TO ENSURE THAT THE STATE'S CLEAN ENERGY GOALS ARE ON TRACK IF YOU SEE SIMPLY NEEDS TO CONDUCT MORE MEANINGFUL REVIEWS OF ANNUAL PROGRESS AND PROVIDE RECOMMENDATIONS WITH RESPECT ANY DEFICIENCY. I'LL GIVE AN EXAMPLE OF HOW THIS PROCESS IS BROKEN. I'M IN THE TWENTY ELEVEN TO TWENTY THIRTEEN COMPLIANCE CYCLE. THREE DIRECT ACCESS PROVIDERS FAILED TO COMPLY WITH THEIR RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STANDARD TARGETS. THEY SUBMITTED REQUESTS FOR WAIVERS IN. TWENTY EIGHTEEN FIVE YEARS LATER -- THESE REQUESTS WERE SUBMITTED SO FAR AFTER THE COMPLIANCE DEADLINE THEY STILL HAVE YET TO BE RESOLVED HERE IN. TWENTY NINETEEN I'M THE PC SHOULD NOT BE ASKED FIRST TO WEIGH IN ON THE ADEQUACY OF THESE PLANS MANY YEARS AFTER THE COMPLIANCE DEADLINES HAVE PASSED SO WE THINK THIS BILL PROVIDES A COMMONSENSE CHECK POINT. THAT ALLOWS FOR A STATUS REPORT TO BE PROVIDED THAT IS MEANINGFUL REVIEWED. ON SB ONE FIFTY FIVE WOULD ALSO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL AUTHORITY -- FOR ALIGNING THE IOP PROGRAM OBLIGATIONS WITH THE 60% RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STANDARD TARGET THAT WAS ADOPTED JUST LAST YEAR IN SB. ONE HUNDRED BY THE RESOURCE PLANS HAVE TO ADDRESS MULTI YOUR RESOURCE ADEQUACY NEEDS AND THE LONG TERM CONTRACTING OBLIGATIONS UNDER EXISTING LAW. WE TINK THAT THESE CHANGES WOULD ENHANCE THE ABILITY OF THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. TO COORDINATE PARTICIPATION BY LOW SERVING ENTITIES IN THE I. R. P. PROCESS IN THE RESOURCE ADEQUACY PROGRAM AND AS PART OF THE OUR PS PROGRAM SO WE REALLY SUPPORT THIS BILL THINK IT'S A COMMONSENSE MODEST MEASURE FORWARD AND ASK FOR YOUR IPHONE. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS GOT WHICH ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA COALITION OF UTILITY EMPLOYEES IN THE STATE ASSOCIATION OF ELECTRICAL WORKERS -- CUSTOMERS WHO WERE WHO SERVED BUT YES PEAS AND CCA'S ALSO SERVED BY -- USE THEY GET SERVICES FROM ALL THREE IT JUST MAKES SENSE TO US THAT THEY HAVE ONE CENTRALIZED REGULATORY BODY THAT THEY CAN GO. TO PARTICIPATE IN THESE PROCEEDINGS AND HAVE A VOICE AND FOR THAT REASON WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THE BILL. HI MY NAME IS STEVE YOU'LL -- YOU I TELL YOUR MY POSITION ON THIS AND PARTICULARLY TO THREE NINETY NINE FIFTEEN BE. TEN I'VE BEEN TRYING TO DO THIS -- BY GETTING DATA OUT OF THE ENERGY COMMISSION. FOR EXAMPLE WHEN THE OUT OF THE PROCESS. THERE'S A HANDSHAKE BETWEEN THE P. YOU SEE ANY ENERGY COMMISSION THE ENERGY COMMISSION DOES THE REPORTING. THE THAT COMMISSIONERS APPROVE THAT IN AND THE P. YOU SEE. I SEE I A I A I WAS AT THE BUSINESS MEETING TO TO TELL THEM. THAT -- THEIR DATA THEY HAVE DIFFERENT OUT -- NET OUTPUT LOW. KILOWATT DATA. AND WHAT I'VE DONE I TAKE IN -- THANK YOU FOR DATA. AND I PUT IT UP AGAINST. SENATE POINTED OUT ABOUT SIXTY OF THEM. WHERE THEY WERE GETTING MORE THAN OF SO? HI I HAVE A SYSTEM THAT WILL ANSWER ALL OF THAT STUFF I I'VE GOT. I IS. YOU SUPPORT PROJECTS SIR I SUPPORT THE PROJECT. WE NEED TO STOP DOING ANALOG MODELING. I GO TO DISCRETE EVENT MODELING. AND I WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK. OKAY FINE ON THAT WE HAVE QUESTIONS FOR YOU WILL CALL YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU MELISSA CORTEZ ROTH ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA WIND ENERGY ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL HOWEVER WE WOULD KNOW TO THAT WE DON'T BELIEVE ANY ON REQUIREMENTS SHOULD BE DERIVE FROM THE INITIAL RP CYCLE WHICH IN MANY. CASES WITH THE TEST CYCLE THANK YOU -- GOOD MORNING CAM MEMBERS LORD AS HE MANAGED TO SEND GAS ELECTRIC IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. HOW DO WE HAVE OPPOSITION? JAMIE MINOR ON BEHALF OF THE LC CA I'M AS LONG AS THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS ARE ACCEPTED WE ACTUALLY REMOVE OUR OPPOSITION THANK YOU. OKAY VERY WELL I DO WANNA DO ASK SPECIFICALLY WHERE YOU GOT TO THE NUMBER TWO THOUSAND FOUR THOUSAND MEGAWATTS AND IF THAT IS -- BASED ON IN A REAL SCIENCE IN TERMS OF WHAT WE NEED IN THE STATE. YEAH THAT WE FOUND WILD. RESEARCH GRANTS WERE. KERN IS LEGISLATION. CONVERSATION WITH INDUSTRY. FOR SO I WOULD ASSUME ALL THAT IS ACCURATE DATA AND NOT MADE UP NUMBERS. AND WILL. IN WHAT TIME DO YOU THINK. THAT AMOUNT TO BE [inaudible] PRODUCED. AND I WOULD THINK CHILI APPROACH HIM BETTER. ADDITION TO ANSWER THAT. ARE SO MAYBE MAYBE IF WE CAN GET. SCOTT WHICH APPEAR OR AND I WANT TO GET TO KIND OF SPECIFICALLY THE NUMBER OF THE TWO TO FOUR THOUSAND BECAUSE IT'S NOT. EXACTLY THOUGHT ON THIS BILL -- I'M SORRY IT'S ON THE THE PUMP STORAGE BILL THAT YOU'RE SPEAKING TO BUT YOU SAID YOU WERE GONNA DO. ONE FIFTY FIVE OKAY I'M YEAH YEAH YOU'RE RIGHT WE'RE ONE FIVE FIVE RIGHT I WENT TO ME FOR A LOOP. YEAH THAT'S PUMP STORAGE OKAY THAT. I WAS I WAS NOT FOLLOWING. THE PRESENTATION BUT I WAS NOT UNDERSTANDING. WHY THEY WEREN'T REALLY SPEAKING TO OKAY? THIS IS THE THAT MAKE SENSE WHY THIS VOTE RESOURCE ADVOCACY I RIDE -- I WANTED TO ASK IF. YOU'RE OKAY WITH AMENDMENTS SAID YES I ACCEPT IT COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS AND WITH IT WILL REMOVE ALL OPPOSITION. OKAY WE HAVE A WE CAN'T BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE A QUORUM BUT WILL THEN WILL -- AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME WE'LL MOVE A BILL WITH AMENDMENTS AT THE PLEASURE OF THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS. THANK YOU THANK YOU OF MOVE ON TO THE NEXT BILL WHICH WILL LARA SB. SIX SEVEN SIX AND SB SIX SEVEN SIX WILL ENSURE THE STATE START I MEAN FULLER -- TO MEANINGFULLY ADDRESS TO REPAIR IMPACTS OF ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING. I ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE TO MEMBERS AGAIN THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS MEASURE BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE EASY CHARGING EXPECTED TO ADD NEARLY ONE GIGAWATTS OF LOW TO OUR GRID DURING PEAK DEMAND. EVERYONE PAYS FOR ACTION GENERATION AND INFRASTRUCTURE NO SIR TO MEET OUR GROWING DAILY PEAK. VEHICLE GRID INTEGRATION CAN SHIFT LOWER. OUT OF THE DAILY PEAK AND MITIGATE AGREED CONGESTION AMONG OTHER BENEFITS THE STATE HAS BEEN DISCUSSING VEHICLE. FOR YEARS IT'S TIME THAT WE REALLY GETS YEARS AND ADDRESS THE PROBLEM AND WITH ME THE DAVID WASHROOM BURKE. ARE FROM E. MOTOR WORKS AND MELISSA ROMERO FROM CALIFORNIA LEAGUE OF CONSERVATION VOTERS AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK DR. HUESO IN THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND THANK YOU CENTER FOR PATRICK FOR YOU COULD YOU SIR I JUST WANTED. TO AGAIN ON THE AMENDMENTS ALL RIGHT UP TO THE MEMBER. GO AHEAD SIR. SO GOOD MORNING AGAIN TO THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND THANKS FOR BRADFORD FOR HIS LEADERSHIP ON THIS TOPIC MY NAME IS DAVID SCHLOSSBERG GONNA REPRESENTING MOTOR WORKS -- WERE ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING STATION MANUFACTURER AND ENERGY SERVICES PROVIDER. I'M HERE TO EXPRESS MY STRONG SUPPORT FOR SB SIX SEVEN SIX WHICH WOULD CREATE A MARKET TRANSFER NAY TRANSFORMATION INITIATIVE FOR VEHICLE RENDON -- INTEGRATION SERVICES IN CALIFORNIA. GIVEN ALL THE AMBITIOUS POLICIES WE HAVE IN THE STATE -- A ROOM WE'VE ADOPTED OVER THE PAST DECADE TO RAPIDLY DE CARBONIZED ARE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR VEHICLE GREAT INTEGRATION IS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF ENSURING THAT ARE LARGE INVESTMENTS IN TRANSPORTATION ELECTRIFICATION. IS DONE IN A WAY THAT MAXIMIZES THE ECONOMIC VALUE TO ALL CALIFORNIANS BOTH THE V. R. OWNERS AS WELL AS THOSE NOT YET ADOPTING YOU VIS. BY ENSURING THAT THE INCREASE IN ELECTRIC DEMAND FROM EVEY CHARGING IS USED IN A LEASE AS A LEASE COST RESOURCE TO INTEGRATE CALIFORNIA'S RENEWABLE ENERGY TARGETS. AND TO ENSURE THAT YOU VIEW CHARGING PROVIDES NOT. ALL REPAIRS AND REDUCES NOT RAISES ELECTRICITY COSTS. THE BILL HERE WOULD CREATE AN ANNUAL TARGET BASED ON THE FORECAST OF EASY CHARGING LOAD OVER A GIVEN YEAR ESTIMATED FOR EACH CHALICES PORTFOLIO -- LOAD SERVING ENTITIES. AND IT'S ACHIEVABLE THROUGH A COMBINATION OF TECHNOLOGY ADOPTION MARKET FORMATION CUSTOMER PROGRAMS AND INNOVATIVE RATE DESIGN. THIS BILL IS TIMELY AN ESSENTIAL AND GIVEN THE IMMENSE AMOUNT OF FUNDING THAT THE STATE IS COMMITTED TO VEHICLE EXTRICATION. AND CHARGING STATION DEPLOYMENT AS WELL AS THE TRANSITION WILL SEE AN EASY MARK. DESK DECADE NEXT DECADE AS WE MOVE FROM EARLY ADOPTERS. TO THE MASS MARKET VVS IT'S ACCEPTABLE FOR ALL [inaudible] THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING TERRY MEMBERS MELISSA ROMERO WITH CALIFORNIA LEAGUE OF CONSERVATION VOTERS. THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE HAS LED THE NATION IN PASSING CLIMATE POLICIES THAT WILL TRANSITION US TO A CLEAN ENERGY FUTURE. AND AS WE LOOK TO THIS CLIMATE TARGETS WE MUST PLAN AHEAD TO ENSURE FLEXIBLE ABOUT GREED BUT BALANCING AS WE TRANSITION TO HER PERCENT RENEWABLE CARBON FREE ENERGY. INCORPORATING IN NOT PLANNING PRACTICES THAT WILL MINIMIZE COST INCREASES AND MAXIMIZE NET RATE REPAIR BENEFITS. AS MORE MORE FAMILIES SWITCH TO ELECTRIC VEHICLES THERE WILL BE MORE EBS PLUGGING INTO THE GRID AND CHARGING. I'M MORE -- MORE EVEY CHARGING STATIONS WILL COME ON LINE. WITH THIS WILL COME IN INCREASED ELECTRICAL DEMAND ON OUR GRADE WHICH PRESENTS AN OPPORTUNITY TO PRACTICALLY PLAN FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLE GREAT INTEGRATION. THIS MEANS INTEGRATING EVEY ISN'T EASY INFRASTRUCTURE IN A WAY THAT INCREASES THE USE OF RENEWABLES AND ALSO REDUCES THE COST OF ENERGY. SB SIX SEVENTY SIX IS A NECESSARY STEP IN SETTING CLEAR TARGETS FOR THIS EVEY GREAT INTO INTEGRATION AND THIS BILL WILL PUT CALIFORNIA ON A PATH TO AN ELECTRIC VEHICLE FUTURE THAT WILL AVOID THE USE OF NON RENEWABLE POWER PLANTS. BY PROVIDING RELIABLE ENERGY FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING DEMAND WHILE MAXIMIZING THE USE OF RENEWABLES. ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE INFRASTRUCTURE CAN AND SHOULD INTEGRATE RENEWABLE ENERGY THROUGHOUT THE ELECTRIC VEHICLE GREAT INTEGRAION IN ORDER TO POSITIVELY IMPACT THE CHANGING NEEDS OF OUR LIKE TO READ. AS WE CHARGE A HAD TO OUR RENEWABLE AND CARBON FREE TRANSITION THANK YOU. OTHERS SPEAKERS IN SUPPORT. YOUR TURN MEMBER SYLVIA SOLUTION ON BEHALF OF ADVANCED ENERGY ECONOMY WERE IN STRONG SUPPORT WE BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A TIMELY -- MEASURE IN ORDER TO COORDINATE -- THE STATE'S ADVANCED ENERGY AND ADVANCE TRANSPORTATION GOALS WHILE IT IS COST EFFECTIVE THANK YOU. HELLO KILLER ROBINSON ON BEHALF OF THE ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING VANESSA GONZALEZ ON BEHALF OF HYUNDAI NORTH AMERICAN SUPPORT. THE DEALER IN SUPPORT TABLE WE'VE ALMOST GOT CURTAILED IS MY CHAD RENEWABLES THE IN APRIL AS WE ALL DID THE ALL LAST YEAR. WELL I SAW DAVE. THANK YOU. ANYTHING FROM THE MEMBERS. QUESTIONS OPPOSITION -- BUT DO WE HAVE OPPOSITION ON THIS BILL. THERE WAS PART OF THE US CENTER SKINNER. YES I APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR I'M TAKING THE AMENDMENTS AT THE MEDICINE MEN SIX YES MA'AM AND ON THE MAKE WATCHES VERY GOOD. I WONDERED -- I ALSO. AS THE AUTHOR OF THE BILL THAT FIRST ALLOWED FOR OUR TIME UTILITIES TO START PURCHASING UTILITY GREAT STORAGE I'M. IN FAVOR OF BUSINESS SEVEN SEVEN YOU'RE YOU'RE NO -- STILL ON THE THANK YOU. ONCE YOU GET TO THE WE'RE ON A ITEM TWELVE RUN ON TIME HE HAS HE HAS LIKE SIXTEEN BILLS ON THE AGENDA TODAY. WE'RE GONNA FIX US SENATE REDFORD'S GONNA FIX ENTIRE ENERGY GREAT TODAY ONE DAY YEAH. I SUPPORT THIS BILL AS THE AMENDED SUGGESTION. THANK YOU. AND IT IS LOOK CONFUSING BUT ANYWAY OF THANK YOU. OF WILL MOVE ON TO YOUR NEXT BILL. NO BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE. WE NEED A QUORUM. ONE TWO ONE NINE SIX WE NEED ONE MORE I COUNTY [inaudible] SURE. WHEN WHEN WE DO I WANNA BE ADAMS CO? I THINK IT'S GREAT. OKAY. I AM THIRTEEN AS IN ALL SEVEN AS FOUR SEVEN OH FOUR THANK YOU WITNESSES -- SB SEVEN OH FOUR MAKES SEVERAL IMPROVEMENTS TO THE LIFELINE PROGRAM THAT WILL INCREASE PARTICIPATION AMONG ELIGIBLE LOW INCOME. CALIFORNIANS MOST IMPORTANTLY IT WILL LARA UNNECESSARY BARRIERS TO THE PROGRAM FOR US TO THE WONDERFUL GROUPS LIKE FOSTER YOUTH INFORMALLY INCARCERATED -- ALSO VALUE EVALUATE WHETHER WE SHOULD INCLUDE BROADBAND AND LIFELINE AS ONE WAY TO ADDRESS THE DIGITAL DIVIDE IS TO ISSUE THAT WE DEALT WITH WHEN I WAS IN ASSEMBLY ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO WE LOOKED AT IT AND IT'S ONE THAT WE'RE STILL LOOKING AT EVERYONE AGREES THIS PROGRAM DESERVES. IMPROVEMENTS SB -- SEVEN OH FOR WILL BEGIN THAT WORK -- I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YA VOTING WITH ME IS VINCE IN LAY WITH. GREEN LINE INSTITUTION AND NAY AND JOHNSON IS GOING TO BE HERE FROM TO CONNECT -- SAID ABOUT -- FOR VINCENT LAY WITH THE GREEN LINING INSTITUTE WE ADVOCATE FOR ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY WE SUPPORT THIS BILL AND ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT BECAUSE BROADBAND AND TELEPHONE SERVICES ARE CRITICAL TOOLS FOR ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY -- IF 1% MORE CALIFORNIA GETS. BROADBAND THAT'S FIFTY TWO THOUSAND MORE JOBS FOR CALIFORNIA AND NEARLY EIGHTEEN BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR -- ADDED TO OUR ECONOMY EACH YEAR SINCE TWENTY TEN WHEN WE DEREGULATED BROADBAND -- PRICES HAVE GONE UP ADOPTION HAS GONE DOWN AND THIS CANNOT HAPPEN -- SO WHILE WE NEED A COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTION TO CLOSE ITS DIGITAL DIVIDE AND LOWER PRICES -- THIS BILL IS A GOOD FIRST STEP THAT'S HOW WE ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU VERY WELL. ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT OF THIS PROJECT. ANYONE IN OPPOSITION MEMBERS -- I WANTED TO ASK ON THIS BILL. FORMS ARE TRANSPLANT IF -- OKAY. OKAY DID YOU WANT TO MAKE ANY CLOSING COMMENTS ARE I THINK THIS IS A STRICT FOR MEASURE AS I STATED TO ISSUE THAT WE'VE BEEN DEALING WITH -- A LIFELINE NO AS WE SEE MORE MORE CUSTOMERS MOVE AWAY FROM A LAND LINE AND ACCESS COMMUNICATIONS THROUGH. OUR WIRELESS DEVICES IS JUST TO COMMONSENSE MEASURE IN IT A AT AN INCREASED PARTICIPATION SERVICE REQUEST FOR OUR LEAD APPEARS WE HAVE A QUORUM NOW LAST. OF THE CLERK TO CALL THE ROLL PLEASE.

SEVEN SEVEN TWO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- SB SEVEN SEVEN TWO WILL FILL THE GAP AND ENERGY RESOURCES THAT WE NEED TO MEET OUR CLIMATE GOES ON LONG TERM -- DURATION BOLTS STORAGE SPECIFICALLY THIS BILL CALLS FOR THE CAL I SO TO PRODUCE AT LEAST. TWO THOUSAND AND UP TO FOUR THOUSAND MEGAWATTS OF BULK STORAGE AND RE COVER THOSE COSTS VIA TRANSMISSION RATES. RENEWABLE ENERGY IS INNER MAN BY NATURE. IF WE WANT TO G. R. TWENTY FORTY FIVE ZERO CARBON POWER GOALS WE NEED BALK ENERGY STORAGE TO HELP BALANCE. ED THIS WILL BENEFIT ALL ENERGY PROVIDERS WE CAN DEBATE EXACTLY WHEN WE WILL NEED THIS RESOURCE BUT BY THE TIME WE ACT WILL BE PROBABLY TOO LATE WE CANNOT WAIT -- FOR WAY TO FIX THIS PROBLEM WE CANNOT -- BOUNCE NOBLES -- ON DOMINATE AGREED IF WE DO NOT HAVE A LOT OF STORAGE AND SPECIALLY BOOKSTORES WE KEEP CITING BIG CLIMATE GOALS. A REQUIREMENT FOR GRIT THIS BILL -- LOOKS TO HELP WITH THAT PRACTICE -- IN MY I'M SORRY IT TO ME BILLS ANIMALS STEP -- THE LEGISLATIVE ARE ACTING ON SHORT TERM DURATION US MISS SKINNER STATED SHE INTODUCED TWENTY FIVE FOURTEEN VIEWS TWO THOUSAND AND TEN NOW IT'S TIME TO ACT ON LONG TERM. STORAGE -- BUT THIS IS STILL NOT A US SILVER BULLET BY ANYWAY ON WITH TECHNOLOGY THERE. ARE STILL OTHER OPPORTUNITIES. THIS BILL IS ABOUT A BASIC GRID NEED BIG RESOURCES THAT CAN -- MIMIC NATURAL GAS SPEAKER PLANTS AND DISCHARGE LARGE AMOUNTS OF ENERGY OVER DAYS AND WEEKS -- SO ON IT -- TOO IT'S MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM IF WE WAIT TILL I AREAS -- AND MOVING FORWARD WITH THIS MEASURE TODAY WITH MRS RDS FROM STATE BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION CONSTRUCTION TRADES CARRY OUT OF BACK FROM NEXTERA AND GLANFORD. FERAL FROM SAN DIEGO COUNTY WATER AUTHORITY AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR I'LL GO. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBER CENTER DOESN'T HELP THE STATE BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL. OPERATOR BE HERE WITH YOU THIS MORNING -- AS YOU ALL WELL KNOW THE STATE BUILDING TRADES COUNCIL HAS BEEN VERY STRONG SUPPORTERS OF HIGHER RPMS. WHICH SUPPORTED THE SP ONE HUNDRED KNOWING THAT MOSTLY SOME OF THOSE JOBS WERE NOT ACTUALLY GOING TO BE CREATING GOOD OPPORTUNITIES FOR OUR MEMBERS TO WORK. BUT WE BELIEVE THAT PROJECTS LIKE THIS WHEN I SLEEP VARIETY THE RELIABLE CAPACITY DICEY GET US TO THE TO THE ONE HUNDRED RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STANDARD GOALS. AND THAT'S WHAT THAT IS WHY WE'RE HERE TODAY. WE KNOW THAT CALIFORNIA'S STEADFAST SUPPORT OF COMMON GOALS WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THERE'S GRID RELIABILITY AS WELL. THIS IS ACTUAL INFRASTRUCTURE INFRASTRUCTURE TO GET US TO SB ONE HUNDRED TO GET US TO THOSE GOALS AND TO SHOWCASE TO OTHER STATES AROUND US THAT CALIFORNIA CAN ACTUALLY BE A PRODUCER SO THAT WE CAN. HELP BECOME THAT LEADER THAT WE ARE CLAIMING TO BE WE CANNOT GET TO OUR GOALS IF WE DON'T HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE RELIABILITY. THIS IS IMPORTANT PROJECT AND CENTER PROJECTS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS POLICY WE RESPECTFULLY URGE YOUR SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS KERRY HOW TO BECOME REGIONAL DIRECTOR OF THE WAY OF WEST GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS FOR NEXT -- ENERGY NEXT OR ENTITIES BEEN AN ELECTRIC GENERATOR PROVIDER IN CALIFORNIA SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX AND IS CALIFORNIA'S LARGEST RENEWABLE GENERATOR AN OPERATOR. WE ON TWENTY SEVEN WIND AND SOLAR FACILITIES REPRESENTING NEARLY NEARLY SEVEN BILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT IN THE STATE ARE CLEAN ENERGY. WE ARE ALSO INVESTORS INC IN ENERGY STORAGE BOTH BOTH IN FRONT AND BEHIND THE METER AS WELL AS INVESTORS A LONG DURATION STORAGE AS WELL AS BEING A TRANSMISSION PROVIDER. WHERE INVESTORS AND EVERY ELEMENT OF CALIFORNIA'S CLEAN ENERGY ECONOMY? WE SUPPORT SB SEVEN SEVEN TWO FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS. THE NEXT STEPS AND GET THE NEXT UPGRADE TO CARBONIZATION REQUIRES VISION AND LEADERSHIP SAID THAT THE INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDED TO SUPPORT CALIFORNIA GOALS IS CONSTRUCTED. CALIFORNIA WILL NEED LONG DURATION ENERGY STORAGE TO MEET ITS CARBON OBJECTIVES. BOOK INTERVIEW STORAGE ASSURES BUT THE CONTINUED INVESTMENT IN CLEAN ENERGY AND THAT CUSTOMERS RECEIVE THE BENEFIT OF THOSE INVESTMENTS. THE STATE FOUND THAT LONG DURATION STORAGE IS THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE PATH FORWARD WITH HIGH LEVELS OF RENEWABLE INVESTMENT AGGRESSIVE CURTAIN CALLS. SB SEVEN SEVEN TWO ELEGANTLY NAVIGATES A GAP IN THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK THAT EXISTS TODAY FOR INFRASTRUCTURE SCALE ELECTRICITY PROJECTS THAT ARE REQUIRED TO COST EFFECTIVELY ME CALIFORNIA'S CARBON GOALS. BUT THE TWENTY THIRTY IN THE TWENTY FORTY FIVE TARGETS. THERE OVER TWENTY SIX LOWERED SERVING ENTITIES IN THE STATE TODAY NO SINGLE LOAD SERVING AND TODAY IS LARGE ENOUGH TO PROCURE LARGE SCALE INFRASTRUCTURE ON THEIR OWN. THIS MEANS THAT WITHOUT ACTION THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE SOLUTION TO MEET THE STATE'S CARBON DE CARBONIZATION GOALS WILL ASSURING GROUP RELIABILITY WILL BE OFF THE TABLE. SB SEVEN SEVENTY PROVIDES AN ANSWER TO BOTH THE COST RECOVERY IN INFRASTRUCTURE SCALE PROBLEM BY ASKING THE ISO FOR THIS LIMITED PURPOSE TO PROCURE BOOK ENERGY STORAGE IN A MANNER SIMILAR TO HOW IT SECURES TRANSMISSION PROJECTS. DíAS ALWAYS BEST POSITION FOR KERR BOOK STORAGE BECAUSE IT ALREADY HAS A PROCESS IN PLACE TO PROCURE TRANSMISSION PROJECTS. THIS PROCESS COULD BE APPLIED DIRECTLY TO BOOK ENERGY STORAGE WHICH HAS A SIMILARLY LONG DURATION CONSTRUCTION TIME. AND AN END HAS A COST ALLOCATION MECHANISMS FOR FOR PROJECTS THAT BENEFIT MULTIPLE. TIME CUSTOMER CLASSES IT ALLOWS CUSTOMERS TO MOVE AROUND WHAT WE STARTED INFRASTRUCTURE IN PLACE. I SAW ALSO THE COST RECOVERY MECHANISM THAT SUPPORTS THE FINANCING OF INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT AND ALLOWS THE STATE TO HARNESS COST SAVINGS WELL SURE SCHERING EQUITABLE COST RECOVERY. THROUGH -- THREE REGULATED RATES IN SHORT SB SEVEN SEVEN TWO BILLS OFTEN EXISTING INEFFICIENT FRAMEWORK. CALIFORNIA MUST INVEST IN BOOK ENERGY STORAGE NOW TO ENSURE THAT THE RENEWABLE INTEGRATION SOLUTIONS ARE THERE BY. TWENTY THIRTY THANK YOU THANK YOU BUT GOOD MORNING A STEVE CREWS HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CITY OF KANDOR WATER FORTY OF PENSION HE FOR FOR GRAN FAIL BUT WE WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF GOOD PROJECTS OUT THERE -- SAN DIEGO -- IS IN THE EARLY STAGES OF PLANNING ITS OWN -- PUMP STORAGE PROJECT. TO THE SANTA CENTER RESERVOIR -- AS STATED IT TAKES A LOT OF TIME A TO THE PLANNING AND SECURE INVESTMENT FOR THIS PROJECT SAN DIEGO'S BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL -- AT BUILDING LARGE SCALE PROJECTS AND SO WE THINK SEVEN SEVEN TWO SENSE OF THEIR PURPOSE SIGNALS -- TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN MOVE FORWARD -- THIS PROCESS SO WE APPRECIATE THE CENTER BRADFORD INTRODUCTION AND AND NOW -- SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY THANK YOU VERY GOOD. ANYONE ELSE'S SUPPORT. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS GOT WHICH ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA COALITION OF UTILITY EMPLOYEES THE STATE ASSOCIATION OF ELECTRICAL WORKERS. THE CALIFORNIA STATE PATRIOTS COUNCIL THE WESTERN STATES COUNTS OF SHEET METAL WORKERS. AND THE ELEVATOR CONSTRUCTORS UNION -- IN. TWENTY SEVENTEEN WOULD SB ONE HUNDRED WAS HELD UP IN THE ASSEMBLY. WE WERE OPPOSED IT WAS THIS SINGULAR ACKNOWLEDGEMENT THAT WE WOULD NEED THIS LEVEL OF INFRASTRUCTURE TO MAKE THAT GOAL ATTAINABLE IS THE REASON THAT WE CAME IN SUPPORT OF THAT BILL HELP MAKE THAT A REALITY. AND WE SEE THIS IS LIKE A COMPLETION OF THAT PROCESS AND WOOD URGENT I'VE A THANK YOU. CHAIRMAN HUESO ON MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ON GARY PASSED FOR WITH THE CONGRESS OF CALIFORNIA SENIORS. WE HAVE BEEN LAW. ACTIVELY IN SUPPORT OF THIS LEGISLATION WE ARE ARE ENTHUSIASTIC SUPPORTERS OF THE STATE'S EFFORTS. TO ACHIEVE A RENEWABLE ENERGY SUPPLY. AND THIS IS IN A CENTRAL PART OF CONCERN. TO THE SENIORS OF CALIFORNIA WHICH WILL SOON BE THE LARGEST DEMOGRAPHIC WITHIN THE STATE. HAVE SPECIAL NEEDS FOR HEALTH CARE. ENERGY SUPPORT. UP AND AND EQUIPMENT IS POWERED BY ENERGY WE CANNOT. HAVE A A A AN INTERRUPTIBLE OR AN INTERMITTENT SUPPLY OF ENERGY. SO WE STRONGLY SUPPORT BALK STORAGE CAPACITY OF THE STATE. AND WE DISASTROUSLY SUPPORT SANDRA BRADFORD TO BILL. AND CONGRATULATE HIM FOR TAKING A LEADERSHIP ON THANK YOU. STEVE YOU ARE AN A AND SUPPORT -- TO WE HAVE NEED TO CONSIDER THAT IT'S MY DE CANCEL THERE I HILL. WE NEED. DUE TO AND NOT BEING ABLE TO GET ENOUGH DATA. TO TO GET SMART TO CONTINUE ON THAT. WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT HOW WE'RE PLANNING ANALOG -- SCHEDULING IS INHERENTLY BATCHING Q.. THE GREAT IS INHERENTLY JUST IN TIME. YOU NEED TO SEE A DISCRETE EVENT SCHEDULING TO DO THAT -- WHAT'S AGAIN I HAVE THAT CAL I SO -- WE'VE ALREADY CURTAILED ALMOST AS MUCH AS WE DID LAST YEAR SO THERE'S THAT DEFINITE NEED WE ALSO NEED TO LOOK AT THE SITUATION AND ALL NOPE TRANSMISSION. WE NEED TO BE CREATIVE ABOUT HOW THIS STORAGE. PATTERN IS CREATED IT WOULD BE BEST TO BEEP CREATED IT AT THE LOW JUST LIKE YOU HAVE A BATTERY IN YOUR PHONE THANK YOU. WHERE TOP ON THE HAVE THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO IN SUPPORT? THANK YOU MELISSA CORTES OFF ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA WIND ENERGY ASSOCIATION I'M A LITTLE BIT BETWEEN THERE KELLY A SUPPORTS THE PROCUREMENT OF GRID INTEGRATION RESOURCES HOWEVER WE'D LIKE TO SEE THE BILL AMENDED. TO NOT HAVE A SPECIFIC AMOUNT OF STORAGE AND HAVE THAT BE DETERMINED BY THE P. UC AND CTC BASED ON THE I. R. P. PROCESS. ADDITIONALLY WE THINK THE COST OF THAT STORE SHOULD BE BASED ON EACH LSTS CONTRIBUTION. TO ELECTRIC SYSTEM CONDITIONS CREATING A NEED FOR THE ENERGY STORAGE IN OTHER WORDS IF YOU HAVE AN OPTIMIZED PORTFOLIO AND ARE RELYING LESS ON THAT STORAGE YOUR COST SHOULD BE LESS. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MARK WEIDEMANN I'M A TWEENER -- USUALLY SENATOR BRADFORD HAS AWESOME BILLS THIS ONE'S JUST SORT OF GOOD. I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF GREENTECH ACTION FUND WHICH IS THE ADVOCACY ARM OF THE ENERGY FOUNDATION. AND WE SUPPORT LONG DURATION BOOK STORAGE AND WE PLAY APPLY THE AUTHOR AND THE SPONSORS FOR MOVIE THIS LEGISLATION FOR TO GET THE DISCUSSION GOING. AROUND THE NEED FOR A LONG DURATION BOOKSTORE JIM CALLIS. ONE OF THE ISSUES WE HAVE AT THE BILL IS THAT THE DEFINITION AROUND WHAT LONG DURATION BOOK STORAGE IS. IS A BIT NARROW. AND WE'RE WORRIED THAT IT'S CONFINED TO ONE PARTICULAR TECHNOLOGY THERE ARE A NUMBER OF TECHNOLOGIES OUT THERE THERE'D BE INCUBATED TODAY THAT ARE VERY. VERY PROMISING FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. YOU'VE GOT THE ABILITY TO STORE ENERGY AND MOLTEN SALT YOU'VE GOT SOME BATTERY TECHNOLOGIES THAT HAVE NOT HIT THE MARKET YET THAT ARE AMAZING. THAT CAN DISCHARGE TWENTY FOUR HOUR PLUS TIME CYCLE FOR LONG DURATION FOR STORAGE. YOU'VE GOT SUBTERRANEAN PUMP HYDRO WE'VE GOT ALL THESE DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGIES OUT THERE IN THE WAY THAT DEFINITIONS DRAFT IN THE BILL TODAY IT WOULD EXCLUDE ALL THOSE TECHNOLOGIES FROM TAKING PLACE. IN A PROCUREMENT PROCESS HAS BEEN MANDATED BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND I THINK WHEN WE DO PROCUREMENTS ON BEHALF OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE OPEN THESE UP. TO ALL FORMS OF TECHNOLOGY SO THEY CAN GET COMPETITIVELY NEUTRAL LANDSCAPE AND EVERYBODY HAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO COMPETE. AND PROVE THAT THEY HAVE THE BEST TECHNOLOGY TO SERVE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THANK YOU. OKAY. ANYBODY IN OPPOSITION. I MIGHT HAVE TO MAKE SOME ROOM APPEAR ON THE DICE FOR THE PRESENTATION. WHAT? THANK THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR JAZZ MONEY JONES FOR THE INDEPENDENT -- ENERGY PRODUCERS WE REPRESENT A LARGE NUMBER OF RENEWABLES WE'D LOVE TO GET BACK TO WORK AND BUILDING THOSE EMPLOYING SOME OF MY LABOR COLLEAGUES. UNFORTUNATELY -- WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW WE ARE OPPOSED TO THIS BILL -- A. L. BUT WE'RE NOT OPPOSED TO PUMP STORAGE OR ANY OTHER BOB VOLK'S -- BALK SYSTEM STORAGE -- WE HAVE A TIME OF GREAT TURMOIL IN ELECTRIC SECTOR -- I'M FRANKLY WORRIED ABOUT THE HONORINE EXISTING COMMITMENTS MY MEMBERS MADE THE CLEAN ENERGY HERE THAT'S VERY REAL WE HAVE ONE UTILITY IN BANKRUPTCY TO THAT ARE TEETERING AND WALL STREET LOOKING WITH JOHN TO SIZE. AS TO EVERYBODY ELSE HERE SO I WOULD SUBMIT THAT THIS IS NOT THE TIME TO BE ADDING ANOTHER. THREE TO TEN BILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF ASSETS INTO THE SYSTEM -- THIS PUMP STORAGE SYSTEM. CALIFORNIA HAVE NOT BEEN TO DETERMINE AS NEEDED -- IN OUR INTEGRATED RESOURCE PLAN WHICH I THINK YOU HEARD A LOT ABOUT EARLIER TODAY THIS BODY IN SB THREE FIFTY PUT THAT FORWARD TO BASICALLY DETERMINE WHAT IS COST EFFECTIVE AND WHAT ISN'T -- THIS IS NOT BEEN IDENTIFIED AS AS NEEDED IN TWENTY THIRTY NOR HAS IT APPEARED IN THE CAL I ESOS TRANSMISSION -- PLANNING PROCESS AND THAT IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE WHAT YOU'RE BEING ASKED TO DO HERE IS TO BASICALLY IDENTIFY THIS RESOURCE AS NECESSARY AS A NECESSARY TRANSMISSION ASSETS WHICH WILL BE COVERED IN FOR WORK REGULATED RATES. YOU LOSE ALL CONTROL OVER THAT -- THE THE SOLICITATION LIMITS COMPETITION -- THERE'S  THERE'S A PHRASE IN THERE THAT HAS TO BE AT LEAST FOUR HUNDRED MEGAWATTS WHY THAT NUMBER IF SOMEONE HAS A GREAT IDEA THAT'S SMALLER THAN THAT. WHY CAN'T THEY PLAY IT ALSO HAS TO BE BUILT IN CALIFORNIA ELECTRICALLY THERE'S NO REASON FOR THAT IN THERE ARE RESOURCES AROUND THE WEST IT MIGHT BE ABLE TO FILL THAT I GET THE INTEREST IN TRYING TO GRAY CALIFORNIA JOBS? BUT THIS IS JUST. LIKE PUTTING A KICK ME SIGN -- ON THIS PROGRAM FROM THE FROM THE COMMERCE CLAUSE SITUATION -- SO IT -- THAT THAT THAT IS A CONCERN -- SO IF WE'RE GOING TO HAVE SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO MOVE FORWARD HERE LET'S MAKE A TRULY COMPETITIVE AND THE WAY THIS IS STRUCTURED IN WRITTEN IT'S NOT COMPETITIVE. LAST BUT CERTAINLY NOT LEAST LAST YEAR YOU ALL HEARD A LOT ABOUT FROM SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES THE FACT THAT WE SHOULD NOT EXPAND THE CALIFORNIA DEPENDED SYSTEM OPERATOR. BECAUSE A FORK -- THAT FOR NETWORK IS GOING TO USE OF HEAVY HAND TO BASICALLY TRY TO CONTROL OUR RESOURCES HERE IN CALIFORNIA. EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS PROJECT IS FEDERALLY JURISDICTIONAL. THE LICENSES FEDERAL JURISDICTION IS CITED UNDER FEDERAL JURISDICTION THE I. S. O. WHICH IS A FEDERALLY REGULATED -- UTILITY IS REQUIRED TO SOLICIT THIS RESOURCE AND ALL THE RATE MAKING IS UNDER -- FOR A JURISDICTION -- SO I KNOW -- IT'S FOOLISH OF ME TO ASK FOR CONSISTENCY BUT I THINK THAT IF WE'RE YOU KNOW IF WE'RE REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT THIS LET'S NOT BE LET'S NOT BE PICKING AND CHOOSING BECAUSE THAT KIND OF GOES FROM INCONSISTENCY HYPOCRISY SO. I WOULD BASICALLY ARGUE THAT -- WE NEED TO GET OUR OUR OUR OUR OUR BRAIN AROUND THAT I THINK IT'S TIME TO SLOW THIS DOWN -- WE'VE GOT TIME TO LOOK AT THIS THE I. R. PETERS ANOTHER ONE COMING UP MAYBE THIS WILL BE THE SHOWS UP -- THERE ARE LESSONS TO BE LEARNED ELSEWHERE THERE ARE PUMP STANDALONE PUMP HYDRO SYSTEMS THAT RUN INTO PROBLEMS IN THE U. S. AND IN EUROPE AND I THINK YOU ALREADY HEARD THAT -- MY UTILITY -- **** DECIDED THE IOWA HILL -- PROJECT WAS A LITTLE -- IT WAS A LITTLE RICH IN A B. AND AND THAT SO WE SHOULD LEARN FROM HIS EXPERIENCE AND NOT YOU TO COMMIT OURSELVES TO OTHER THREE TO TEN BILLION DOLLARS -- IN NEW COST THANK YOU. PATRICK WELL TO THE CALIFORNIA MINUTES WE TO LEASES AS ASIAN REPRESENTING THE PUBLIC AND ELECTED TO LISA PROVIDE ELECTRICITY TO ABOUT 25% OF THE STATE. WE SHARE THE AUTHOR'S INTEREST IN PROPONENTS INTERESTED IN A STABLE LOW CARBON GRADE AND WE BELIEVE THE ENERGY STORAGE IS PART OF THAT SOLUTION. BUT WE ARE OPPOSED SB. SEVEN SEVEN TWO OUR MEMBERS ARE OPEN TO PROCURING THIS TYPE OF RESOURCE AND AS YOU HEARD SMALL AT ONE OF OUR MEMBERS ACTUALLY LOOKED INTO THIS -- PROJECT HERE IN THE SACRAMENTO AREA AND AND WOOD PROCURED IF IT MAKES ECONOMIC SENSE TO DO SO BUT WE HAVE CONCERT SERIOUS CONCERNS ABOUT BEING COLLECTIVELY FORCED TO DO THE PROCUREMENT THROUGH LEGISLATION -- ABSENT ANY IDENTIFIABLE PROCUREMENT NEED FOR OUR CUSTOMERS. AB WE AGREE WITH ANALYSIS THAT THERE ARE FUNDAMENTAL QUESTIONS THAT NEED TO BE ANSWERED HOW MUCH IS NEEDED WHERE IS IT NEEDED AND WHEN IS IT NEEDED WE BELIEVE THAT MORE ANALYSIS AND PLANNING IS NEEDED BEFORE MOVING FORWARD ON THIS LEGISLATION. THE CAMINO HOUSES ALSO POINTS OUT THAT PEER USE ARE ON TRACK TO MEET THEIR TWENTY TWENTY OUR PS GOALS AND ARE WORKING TOWARDS A TWENTY THIRTY GOALS. SENIOR AIDES MEMBERS HAVE BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL MEETING OR EXCEEDING THOSE OUR PS REQUIREMENTS BECAUSE OF THEIR EFFECTIVE PROCUREMENT POLICIES THAT INSURE THE CONSIDERATION OF A DIVERSE. PORTFOLIO OF RENEWABLE ENERGY RESOURCES WHAT THE SAME TIME KEEPING RATES LOW FOR THEIR RATE PAYERS. AS AN EXAMPLE IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN ON BEHALF OF TWELVE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA USE THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA PUBLIC POWER AUTHORITY REVIEWED OVER HUNDRED FORTY PROPOSALS AND SIGNED CONTRACTS. FOR OVER NINETEEN HUNDRED MEGAWATTS OF RENEWABLES WHILE KEEPING RATES THIRTEEN CENTS PER KILOWATT LOWER AND THE I. O. U. RATES. DESPITE THIS SUCCESSFUL PROCUREMENT ON BEHALF FOR THE P. O. USE SB SEVEN SEVEN TWO MANDATES ENERGY THAT WE DO NOT BELIEVE IS NEEDED AT THE CURRENT TIME. FINALLY WE ALSO AGREE WITH ANNOUNCES THAT SOME PATIENTS AS WARRANTED AND THE PROPONENTS STIPULATE THAT THERE IS AN URGENCY TO CONSTRUCT THESE PROJECTS. HOWEVER WE WOULD NOTE AGAIN THAT A USER ON TRACK TO MEET THE TWENTY THIRTY GOALS IN THAT THERE IS A POLICY IN PLACE UNDER SB. ONE HUNDRED FOR A JOINT ASSESSMENT TO BE CONDUCTED BY THE CDC THE P. YOU SEE AND THE AIR BE TO DETERMINE WHAT IS NEEDED. TO REACH A 100% ZERO CARBON BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE THAT ANALYSIS IS DUE IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE AT THE VERY LEAST. WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO CONSIDER THAT ANALYSIS BE BEFORE MOVING FORWARD ON THESE BILLION DOLLAR PROJECTS AND THANK YOU AND RESPECTFULLY. IN OPPOSITION. GOOD MORNING I'M FILING ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA NATIVE PLANT SOCIETY AND I'VE ALSO INCORPORATED SOME COMMENTS FROM OTHER ENVIRONMENT ORGANIZATIONS THAT WILL BE LINING UP TO DO TO ME TO SOME LITTLE BIT -- LIKEWISE ORGANIZATION SUPPORT ENERGY STORAGE PROJECTS BECAUSE OF THE THE BENEFIT. TO THE GRID STABILITY AND COMPLIMENTING INTERMENT AND RENEWABLE RESOURCES SUCH AS WIND AND SOLAR WHICH PORT OF BUT RESPECTFULLY MO WE MUST OPPOSE SB SEVEN SEVEN TWO BECAUSE IT'S YOU KNOW A BIG COMPONENT OF THIS BILL IS IS REALLY ABOUT BREATHING NEW LIFE INTO ONE SPECIFIC -- CONTROVERSIAL NORMALLY DAMAGING PUMP STORAGE HYDRO PROJECT IN THE CALIFORNIA DESERT AND THAT'S THE THE EAGLE CREST PUMP STORAGE PROJECT -- YOU KNOW IT'S BEEN A FILL IN THE WORKPLACE FOR THREE DECADES ALREADY WITH AN ACCEPTABLE COST TO CALIFORNIA'S WATER PARKS AND WILDLIFE RATE PAYERS IN THE NOBLE AND FUTURE. AND YOU KNOW OUR OTHER. FOR IN TESTIMONY TO A TEST ON HIS EVERY SPOKEN TO THE REPAIR IMPACTS AND AND TO TO THE BURKE ISSUES THAT ARE EVEN OUTLINED -- THE LAST THING I WOULD SAY THOUGH IS ANYTHING THAT REALLY INCREASES COSTS TO RATEPAYERS -- ELECTRICITY -- ON THEIR BILLS BECOMES A DISINCENTIVE TERM TO MOVE TOWARDS ELECTRIFICATION OF OUR OF OUR CAR FLEET IN OF ITSELF. COM THAT'S WHAT'S BEEN ONE OF THE BIG INCENTIVES AND DRIVERS FOR ADOPTION OF ELECTRIC VEHICLES -- SO THEN MEASURES THAT THAT ALTERNATELY WE ALL KNOW WE'RE GOING TO INCREASE COSTS TO RATEPAYERS WILL HAVE THAT THAT NEGATIVE IMPACT AS WELL. UNLIKE THE SENT THE PROPOSED SEND YOU SENT -- TO PROJECT IN SAN DIEGO THAT'S OPPOSED BY THE SAN DIEGO COUNTY WATER AUTHORITY OR ANY OTHER PROPOSED FROM START PART IN CALIFORNIA. THE EAGLE CHRIS PROJECT IN PARTICULAR RELIES ON PUMPING AGING GROUND WATER FROM AN ALREADY OVER DRAFTED DOESN'T OXFORD IN ORDER TO FEEL RESERVOIRS -- AND WITHIN AN AQUIFER THAT IS THE CASE IT'S SOME IT'S BOUNDED ON THREE SIDES BY THE NATIONAL PARK BY JOSHUA TREE NATIONAL PARK -- AS YOU CAN IMAGINE. WE KNOW THAT THESE ARE VERY SENSITIVE ECOLOGICAL HABITAT AREAS -- THE NATIONAL PARK SERVICE'S IN THE BUSINESS OF OF DEDICATING PARK SPACE -- FOR AREAS THAT DON'T HAVE THIS AND SO THE FACT THAT THIS IS BOUNDED ON ON BRIEF. ALMOST FOUR SIDES -- COMPLETELY BIVA AND THE NATIONAL PARK ITSELF. IS WHAT REALLY IS DRIVING A LOT OF OUR OWN ANXIETY ON ON THIS PROJECT. SO THE NATIONAL PARK SERVICE RENDON TWENTY SEVENTEEN THAT EAGLE CHRIS GROUNDWATER PUMPING WOULD QUOTE BECAUSE DAMAGING OVER JEFF CONDITIONS BY PUMPING THOUSANDS OFACRE FEET OF WATER FROM AN ALREADY OVER DRAFT IT DOESN'T OFFER. WITH NO GROUND WATER RESEARCH COMPLETED BUT STATE THE NATIONAL PARK SERVICE RESEARCH SERVES AS THE MOST RELIABLE IN INDEPENDENT SCIENCE ON HIS -- THE PROJECT OPPONENTS CLAIM THAT THEIR PROJECT WILL NOT HARM THAT IS A ROCK FOR BECAUSE THE OPERAS RECHARGE RATE IS THIRTEEN THOUSAND ACRE FEET. BUT THE PARK SERVICE'S RESEARCH ESTIMATES THAT THE RECHARGE RATE IS LIKELY CLOSER 230-002-6000 ACRE FEET A YEAR -- THE FRACTION OF THE OF WHAT'S NEEDED -- THE PROJECT ONE TURNOVER DRAFTING ABOUT FOR WILL ALSO LIKELY AFFECT ROUNDED UP IN AN ECOSYSTEMS AND THE REGIONAL SPRINGS THAT SUSTAIN A LOT OF THE WILDLIFE. AND NATIVE PLANT HABITAT. IN JOSHUA TREE NATIONAL PARK. THIS KIND OF GROUND WATER MINING WOULD BE IN VIOLATION ESSENTIALLY IT TO SAY POLICY IN FEDERAL LAND USE PLANS. INCLUDING THE DESERT RENEWABLE ENERGY CONSERVATION PLAN -- AND FOR THESE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY ORIGIN OF A ON SB SEVEN SOME. TO STATE YOUR NAME AND YOUR POSITION ON THE BILL PLEASE. MISTER CHAIR. GREG C<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt; RISING ON THE&lt;/c&gt;</u> CALIFORNIA POWER AGENCY I WOULD LIKE TO WITH YOUR INDULGENCE WOULD LIKE TO PRESENT TO OTHER ISSUES THAT HAVE NOT BEEN DISCUSSED US FAR. NUMBER. ONE THE CAL I SO WHEN IT WAS ESTABLISHED IN AB EIGHTEEN NINETY IN NINETEEN NINETY SIX WAS ESTABLISHED AS AN INDEPENDENT SYSTEM OPERATOR. THIS LEGISLATION WOULD PROVIDE THAT THE CALLOUS SO IS NOW A GENDER. ACQUIRING GENERATION AND SO THEY'RE NO LONGER INDEPENDENT THEY'RE GOING TO BE ASSURING THAT THEIR YOUTH FACILITY IS USED IN FACT THE ANALYSIS ON PAGE THREE LINE ITEM NUMBER FIVE TALKS ABOUT. THE RESPONSIBILITY OF ASSURING THAT THAT THE COST OF THIS THING ARE GOING TO BE SHARED BY ALL. OF THE PARTICIPANTS ON THE CAL I SO SYSTEM SO IT'S GOING TO REYES. FOR THOSE OF US WHO MAY OR MAY NOT NEED IT THE SECOND IMPORTANT ISSUE IS THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION ARTICLE LEVIN SECTION NINE STATES CLEARLY. THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE PROVISION OF ELECTRIC SERVICE. FORTY PLUS CITIES COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA HAVE ACCEPTED THAT RESPONSIBILITY AND THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE RESOURCE ADEQUACY FOR THEIR CITIZENS. THIS REMOVES THAT RESPONSIBILITY FROM THEM AND GIVE IT TO THE I ALSO WE RESPECTFULLY URGE OR NO VOTE THANK YOU THANK YOU. MR TURN MEMBERS DELANEY HUNTER ON BEHALF OF THE SOLAR ENERGY INDUSTRIES ASSOCIATION AND HAIDAR STORE IN STRONG OPPOSITION. RESEARCHER MEMBERS MANY MISSION IN ANY ON BEHALF OF THE LARGE SCALE SOLAR ASSOCIATION -- WE AGREE THAT IMMIGRATION RESOURCES ARE NEEDED BUT THIS ISN'T QUITE THE RIGHT WAY WE POST BILL. AND MICHAEL BOCA DOOR WITH THE AG ENERGY CONSUMERS ASSOCIATION ON BEHALF THE STATE'S FARMERS FOOD PROCESSORS TERRY'S AND WINERIES. ALSO IN STRONG OPPOSITION YOU HAVEN'T HEARD FROM RATE PAYERS SO I WANT TO REMIND YOU OVER THE NEXT NINETY DAYS YOU'RE GOING TO BE DEALING WITH WILD FIRE ISSUES IN THIS LEGISLATURE. AND ABOUT FIFTY BILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF THE COULD END UP ON RATE PAYERS. THIS ADDS TO THAT BURDEN WE CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE YOU'RE GONNA TO BE YOUR OWN SACRAMENTO ALL CITIES BUILDING ELECTRIFICATION ELECTRIC VEHICLES ARE GONNA GO BY THE WAYSIDE. BECAUSE OUR ELECTRIC RATES ARE SO HIGH IN THE STATE THANK YOU. ONE OF THEM IT ON A WITHOUT ABOUT CALIFORNIA WE SINCERELY OPPOSE -- THIS PROJECT SIMPLY OR THIS MEASURE SIMPLY BECAUSE WE SHOULDN'T BE PUMPING OF GROUNDWATER OUT OF THE DESERT THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON OR GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS ANTHONY SAMPSON ON BEHALF OF THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA PUBLIC POWER AUTHORITY IN OPPOSITION FOR THE REASONS STATED BY THE CALIFORNIA MUNICIPAL UTILITIES ASSOCIATION. MY ADDRESS ON BEHALF OF THE NATURE CONSERVANCY IN OPPOSITION. THIRTY YEARS OF THE CALIFORNIA LEAGUE FOOD PRODUCERS REPRESENTING THE FOOD PROCESSING INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA JUST LIKE TO ECHO THE COMMENTS MADE BY MISTER BILL BUT THEY'RE ALL VERY CONCERNED FROM RUSSIA INDUSTRIAL RATE PAYER PERSPECTIVE THE PORTABILITY. OF OF ENERGY IN THE STATE. LAUREN COMMON BE ALBUM SIERRA CLUB CALIFORNIA WE ECHO THE COMMENTS MAY NOT POSITION TODAY IN ORDER NO VOTE. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MATT FREEMAN ON BEHALF OF TURNED WE HAVE A CONCERN POSITION ON THIS BILL. AND IN PARTICULAR WE BELIEVE THIS BILL DIRECTLY INVITES THE FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION TO GET INVOLVED IN CALIFORNIA RESOURCE PLANNING POLICY. FOR THOSE PAYING ATTENTION. THE APPOINTEES TO THE FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION BY THIS PRESIDENT ARE NOT PARTICULARLY SYMPATHETIC TO CALIFORNIA'S CLEAN ENERGY AND CLIMATE GOALS BUT THIS BILL. BAGGS THEM TO GET INVOLVED BECAUSE IT MEANT MADE BY THE I SO WOULD BE REVIEWED AND APPROVED BY FOR WORK. NATIONAL STAKEHOLDERS WOULD BE INVOLVED IN THE VIEWS OF THIS LEGISLATURE WOULD BE IRRELEVANT TO THAT DETERMINATION WE THINK THIS WOULD BE A HUGE MISTAKE IN SEATING STATE AUTHORITY TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. AND IT MAY PRODUCE VERY SIGNIFICANT UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE ANY OTHER SPEAKERS -- I HAVE A FEW COMMENTS BUT I WANTED -- TO DEFERRED TO CENTER HERTZBERG BECAUSE HE'S GOT A ANOTHER MATTER TO TEND TO CENTER HERTZBERG DID YOU WANT THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. JOHN I APPRECIATE YOUR GENEROSITY IN THAT REGARD. AND I ALSO WANT TO THANK YOUR STAFF FOR YET ANOTHER BRILLIANT IN THE ANNALS ANALYSIS HERE THEY JUST DID A FANTASTIC JOB AND DOING THE HOMEWORK IT'S ALWAYS NICE TO SEE. THAT QUALITY OF WORK. ON I SAT IN THIS COMMITTEE LAST YEAR AND SAID AND I SAY IT AGAIN TODAY I AM A GIGANTIC. I HAVE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY IN MY PREVIOUS IN IN MY INTERREGNUM LIFE BETWEEN GOVERNMENT SERVICE. TO TO TO WATCH AND SEE A LOT OF THESE FACILITIES AND AND THOUGHT THEY HAD GREAT CAPACITY AND HAVE DONE GREAT THINGS WHAT WORRIES ME ABOUT WHAT WE SEE BEFORE US AND AND IN THE END IT ALL THE ADVOCATES IS NOT JUST AN EXTRAORDINARY AMOUNT OF TIME ON THIS. MEASURE I SPOKE TO THE AUTHOR ABOUT IT -- IT'S NOT JUST A KNEE JERK REACTION IS HARD FOR ME TO TO TO DO THIS GIVEN THE MY PEOPLE WHO MY HOLDEN HIGHEST REGARD BUT IT PRESENTS SOME SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES SOME OF WHICH WILL I'LL JUST QUICKLY ARTICULATE. A AND I APOLOGIZE. SB FIFTIES ANOTHER COMMITTEES OF THESE COMPETING MEASURES WE'VE GOT TO DEAL WITH. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENED IS WE HAVE BEEN INVOLVED THIS KIND OF EXISTENTIAL CRISIS IN A COUPLE OF WAYS. ONE IS WITH THE MIDDLE OF THIS TRANSITION WHICH THE PROPONENTS OF THIS MEASURE ARE TRYING EARNESTLY INAPPROPRIATELY TO FIGURE OUT HOW DO WE DEAL WITH STORAGE. GIVEN THE FACT THAT WE HAVE OUR RENEWABLE ENERGY THAT'S NOT RELIABLE AND WE'RE CHANGING THE SYSTEM AND YOU GOTTA HAVE IT MAKES TOTAL SENSE I GET IT. ON BUT AT THE SAME TIME THE QUESTION IS AT WHAT PRICE. AT WHAT PRICE. ARMED WE NOW HAVE IS WAS EXPRESSED THE COMPRESSION ON ON RATES WHAT YOU'RE GONNA SEE IN WILD FIRES BY. WE'VE GOT THIS ISSUE WHERE DO YOU WANT TO SPEND ALL THIS MONEY TODAY I'M TOLD THE TAKES THREE PLUS YEARS TO GET THIS PROJECT BUILDS WHEN A AS THE ANALYSIS POINTS OUT STAFF CONCLUDED THAT THERE'S ENOUGH LEAD TIME BEFORE. TWENTY THIRTY UNDER THE FORTY TWO MM T. SCENARIO THAT THE PROCUREMENT ACTIVITIES DO NOT NEED TO BEGIN IN THIS AYE ARE PETE -- CYCLE SO ISTHERE A NEED WE'RE UP AGAINST THIS SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM I'M SITTING HERE AND THEN SO WE'RE DOING TWO BIG THINGS IN TRMS OF MOVING FORWARD WITH THIS AT THIS TIME. ONE IS WE ARE IS ICY AT WE NEED TO REALLY FIGURE OUT HOW MUCH RATE PRESSURES IN THE YOUNG PEOPLE BECAUSE THE FIRES AND WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE. IN TWO WE ARE WHETHER YOU CALL IT STORAGE OR TRANSMISSION OR WHATEVER WE ARE OPENING A VERY BIG BACK DOOR TO THE FORK THAT WE HAVE BEEN FIGHTING. FOREVER IN LETTING THEM COME IN AND SET RATES IN CALIFORNIA AND THE FOUR DOES NOT CARE ABOUT. THE UNDERLYING POLICY ISSUES THAT IS SO IMPORTANT TO CALIFORNIA THE FORK IS A REGULATED BODY THAT'S JUST ABOUT RELIABILITY WHICH IS AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT WHAT WHAT THE GOVERNOR TALKED ABOUT IN HIS REPORT ON WILDFIRES. IS HE'S HAS FIVE POINTS ONE IS THE RELIABILITY AND COST PEACE BUT ONE ALSO IS PROMOTING OUR CLEAN ENERGY POLICIES NOW CLEARLY WHAT THIS PROJECT IS DOING IS DOING THAT. THE BALANCE HERE IN TERMS OF WHERE WE ARE TODAY YOU KNOW I KNOW EAGLE MOUNTAIN WELL I MEMBERS PRODUCT BACK TO THE WHAT IT WOULD TAKE HIGH SCHOOL NO THE PEOPLE FROM UP THERE AND BEEN THERE MANY TIMES AND NOTE. THIS PARTICULAR. ALTHOUGH I RARELY AGREE WITH MR WEIDEMANN WHO I SAW SPEAKER TODAY. YOU KNOW I A THE ISSUE IS DO DO YOU I I DO YOU AND I JUST REYES ONE COUPLE MORE POINTS HERE DO YOU ACTUALLY NEED. TO KNOWLEDGE THE ONE THING THAT I'VE LEARNED BEING AROUND THE RENEWABLE ENERGY BUSINESS FOR THIRTY FIVE YEARS. IS JUST THE EXTRAORDINARY RATE OF CHANGE THE EXTRAORDINARY RATE OF CHANGE THE REDUCTION IN COSTS THE RATE OF CHANGE THAT'S OCCURRING IN THE REAL BILL SPACE. AND YES THIS CLEARLY 1100% MEETS OUR GOALS WHAT DO WE HAVE A WINDOW OR NOT CAN WE TAKE THIS UP NEXT YEAR AFTER WE HAVE SOME MORE INTELLIGENCE HOMEWORK. I DON'T WANNA THROUGH OUT THE WINDOW BECAUSE IT HAS A LOT OF VALUE THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT. I JUST THINK IT RAISES THE QUESTION ABOUT. THE WILDFIRES I THINK IT RAISE THE QUESTION ABOUT. FOR YOU KNOW AND SO WHAT WE'RE DOING IS WE'RE BALANCING WE'RE SAYING OKAY THIS BILL WILL POLICY SO IMPORTANT WE'VE COME OUT WITH A PLAN TO SOLVE YOUR NOBLE POLICY. BUT WHAT'S HAPPENING OVER HERE IS WE'RE SAYING WELL WAIT A SECOND IT RUNS INTO ALL THE STUFF WE FELT HERE IN THIS COMMITTEE MISTER CHAIRMAN. DOING REGIONALIZATION OF STUFF AND I JUST CLOSE ON THIS WELL YOU KNOW I WOULD GOOD DEAR FRIEND NAMED ONLY GOTTEN US WHO SERVED IN THE LEGISLATURE WITH ME HERE. AND AND THEN WENT ON TO THE CITY COUNCIL AND OVERSAW THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER AND POWER. A COMMITTEE IN THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES AND I LEARNED GREAT LESSONS FROM HIM BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENS IS IS THAT UTILITIES ON THE ONE HAND WE IN GOVERNMENT AND IT'S IT'S JUST. AN HONEST ASSESSMENT. ARE TRYING TO MEET ALL THESE POLICIES WITH THE END OF THE DAY PRICE MATTERS TO PEOPLE IF THE RATES GET TOO HIGH IF WE TAKE ACTIONS TO ACHIEVE. PERFECTLY APPROPRIATE INTELLIGENT THOUGHTFUL CONSISTENT VALUES BUT ALL OF A SUDDEN THE PRICE SPIKES WE ALL OF A SUDDEN SAY WITH WAY SECOND WE'RE NOT SO SURE WE WANT TO DO THAT. BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED IMPACTS THEIR LIVES AND SO HERE YOU HAVE THE YOU'RE GETTING TO FORK. THIS ABILITY TO DO THIS ON THE ONE HAND. ON IN SO YOU'VE BASICALLY WHAT WE'RE FACING IS THIS EXTRAORDINARY CHALLENGE OF HONORABLE ATTENTION SEARCH THIS IS NOT A PROJECT WHERE PEOPLE ARE SAYING -- WE WANT TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT THEY ARE ABSOLUTELY TRYING. TO TO TO TO IMPLEMENT EXACTLY WHAT WE SAID WE WANT TO DO IN GOVERNMENT THEY ARE EXACTLY FINDING THE WHOLE. BUT THAT'S RUNNING UP AGAINST THESE OTHER DYNAMIC SO I JUST SURE THAT BECAUSE I THINK THAT. AN HONEST ASSESSMENT OF THIS YOU KNW WITH IT IN TERMS OF HOW WE DO THIS NEEDS TO LOOK AT THAT. IN IN YOU MARRY THAT WITH THE RATE OF CHANGE DO YOU WANT TO SPEND. THAT KIND OF MONEY I LEAVE IT TO YOU TO DETERMINE WANTED YOU JUST THANK YOU MISTER INTERFERE DIRECT GENEROSITY AND WILLING TO TAKE THE TIME. TO SHARE THOSE THOUGHTS THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND AGAIN -- OF THANK YOU FOR THAT. AND THANK YOU FOR THE AUTHOR FOR BEEN INTRODUCING THIS MEASURE AND TAKING THIS ISSUE ON IT'S IT'S IT'S IT'S AN ISSUE NEEDS TO BE DISCUSSED THE MATTER THAT NEEDS TO BE BROUGHT BEFORE THE PUBLIC AND WE NEED TO DISCUSS THE MERITS. AND ALSO THE CHALLENGES FACING IN OR OUR OUR ENERGY GRID. I MEAN AS AS WERE AS WERE HERE PLANNING FOR THE FUTURE WE HAVE. YOU KNOW WHAT WILDFIRE SEASON KIND OF APPROACHING QUICKLY. AND WE'RE ALL WORKING VERY HARD TO ENSURE THAT WE WE LESSEN THE FIRES AND WE HARDEN THE GRID ALL THAT'S GOING TO HAVE A COST. WE UNDERSTAND THATWERE GOING TO HAVE TO SOMEHOW. GO BACK TO THE RATE PAYERS AND AND ASK THEM TO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION THAT'S A THAT'S GOING TO BE A VERY HARD THING TO DO BECAUSE I ALREADY THINK. THAT OUR OUR RATES ARE VERY HIGH IN THE HAVE FINANCE THE TRANSITION IT'S GETTING US TO A BETTER PLACE. HELPING TO REDUCE EMISSIONS HELPING TO COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE. THINGS THAT ARE. I THINK THE CENTRAL TO OUR SURVIVAL. BUT AT THE SAME TIME. IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO GET THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ON BOARD. WITH THIS WITH THIS -- WITH THIS. THE STRATEGY AND IT'S HARDER TO DO. AS A STANDALONE STATE -- YOU KNOW -- ONE OF FIFTY STATES -- TAKING AGGRESSIVE ACTION ON THIS AND EVERYONE ELSE DOES SEEM. TO SEE THE SAME URGENCY THAT WE DO -- AND THIS IS OF THIS POLICY IS KIND OF RESULTING FROM THE FACT THAT WE NEED A BALANCE OUR GRID. REPAIRS -- IN MY NECK OF THE WOODS ALREADY SEEN THE FAT FACTS OF AN IMBALANCE GRID -- RATES GO UP ARE GOING UP IN THE EVENING NOW RATES GO DOWN DURING THE DAY. SO DEPENDING ON WHO YOU ARE YOU HAVE TO ADJUST YOUR ENTIRE LIFESTYLE TO KEEP YOUR BILL. THE SAME. AND IF THIS FOR SOME PEOPLE IT'S A IT'S A CULTURE CHANGE IT'S AN INCONVENIENCE. IT ALSO IS AFFECTING YOUR QUALITY OF LIFE. SO IF WE CAN WE CAN CREATE THE PROJECTS THAT. THAT HELPS BALANCE THAT. I THINK PEOPLE. WHAT WHAT WILL SUPPORT THAT BUT AGAIN? NO I I HAVE LOOKED AT I I HAVE READ THE ANALYSIS AND SEEN -- THE RECOMMENDATIONS I I THINK THE REASONABLE. BUT AT THE SAME TIME I UNDERSTAND. WHAT THE PROPONENTS ARE ARE ARE ARGUING FOR I MEAN REGIONAL I SEEN THE COST TO THE STATE MAKES A LOT OF SENSE? YOU CAN'T DO THAT WITHOUT GOING THROUGH THE CHI SO AND THAT'S THE THE WHOLE PURPOSE OF THAT AND IT MAKES SENSE I'D RATHER. SHARE THE COST OF CREATING A BALANCING WITH ALL OF CALIFORNIAN AND JUST SAYING -- ZANE DIEGANS WERE ONLY GONNA SHOULDER THE BURDEN OF LOVE ONE MAJOR PROJECT [inaudible] SO. FOR THE PEOPLE THAT ARE SAYING NO WE CAN DO BETTER I'D LIKE TO HEAR SPECIFIC SUGGESTIONS. BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE NEED WE NEED WE NEED YOUR YOUR SUGGESTIONS IN TERMS OF HOW TO DO THIS BETTER. I I HOPE I WANT TO COULD SEE THIS PROJECT CONTINUE FORWARD TO CONTINUE THAT DEBATE AND I'M HEARING FROM PEOPLE WE GOT BETTER IDEAS OF TO DO LET'S WORK ON THEM. BECAUSE WE NEED TO FIND. WE NEED TO FIND THE EFFICIENCY WE NEED TO FIND THE SAVING BUT WE NEED IN THE END THE THE RESULT THIS BILL IS. IS ACHIEVING TO OBTAIN WHICH THE BALANCING OF OF THE WAY WE PROCURE AND DISTRIBUTOR ENERGY. IT NEEDS IT NEEDS TO WORK AND RIGHT NOW PEOPLE SAYING THAT THIS IS AN TIMELY I'M SORRY IF THIS BILL GOT PASSED TODAY THIS YEAR. AND GOT SENT TO SIGN THIS YEAR WE WOULDN'T SEE THE FIRST PROJECT. FOR THE VERY LEAST VERY LEAST FIVE YEARS. WHERE WE GONNA BE IN FIVE YEARS WE'RE GOING TO BE IN A MUCH? DIFFERENT PLACE TO BE A GREATER SENSE OF URGENCY IN FIVE YEARS. THIS BILL IT GETS US OFF ON A PATH THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY APPROVE ONE PROJECT OR ANOTHER. SO IF YOU'RE YOU'RE. IF YOU'RE ARGUING THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF ANY PARTICULAR. BECAUSE WE DO HAVE A PROCESS BY WHICH THESE PROJECTS ARE PROVING THEY HAVE TO GO THROUGH ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW. AND THERE WILL BE A PROCESS TO APPROVE THAT. THIS THIS BILL TODAY DOES NOT APPROVE ANY SPECIFIC ANYONE PROJECT. IT IT MAKES IT POSSIBLE FOR SOME OF THESE PROJECTS TO PRE APPROVED I UNDERSTAND THAT BUT AGAIN. THEY STILL HAVE TO SHOW THAT THEY HAVE THEY WILL NOT AFFECT THE ENVIRONMENT IN CALIFORNIA. ARE WE WE HAVE A PROCESS FOR THAT AND AND THIS BILL THIS BILL DOES NOT WEAKEN THAT. THIS BILL DOES NOT ELIMINATE THAT PROCESS OR WEAKENED IT OR GIVE. THESE PROJECTS. OF ANY DIFFERENT STANDING ENVIRONMENTALLY THAN THEY WOULD OTHERWISE SO -- I WANT TO WORK WITH YOU CENTER BRADFORD IN TERMS OF ADVANCING THIS BILL AND WORK WITH -- THE OPPONENTS OF THIS BILL TO SEE IF THERE ARE. BETTER WAYS TO DO THIS. AS YOU SAY THAT THERE ARE. AND IF YOU SAY WELL THIS IS NOT THE BEST WAY TO NEVER MIND DON'T DO AND I THINK THAT'S THAT'S NOT REALLY [inaudible] OF A IS IN TUNE WITH WHAT THE SITUATION WE ARE HERE. IN OUR STATE I MEAN I HEAR OVER AND OVER THE TOP CHART THE DUCK CHART THE DUCK CHART. AND IF YOU'RE IN SOLAR THE DUCK CHART IS YOUR ENEMY. AND IF YOU FIND A WAY TO ADDRESS THE IF YEARS SOLAR POWER IF YOU'RE IN ANY KIND OF RENEWABLE POWER THE DUCK CHART IS YOUR ENEMY. AND UNLESS YOU USE ALL THE DUCK CHART THERE WILL BE NO. NEW PROCUREMENT. IN THOSE INDUSTRIES. SO ARE THIS IS A TOUGH ONE AND AND YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A OF A LOT OF A CHALLENGES GOODNESS THROUGH BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND. THIS IS A A A CONTROVERSIAL PROCESS BUT I WANT TO HELP YOU. AT LEAST ADVANCED ADVANCE THIS OF AND SEE WHERE WE CAN GET -- TO THERE'S GONNA BE A LOT OF A LOT OF BILLS COMING THROUGH THIS YEAR AND A LOT OF ACTION. ON ON WALL FIRES AND ON THE ON ON THE FINANCIAL STABILITY OF OUR OF OUR OF OUR A LOT ELECTRICAL COMPANIES. SO THIS IS GOING TO GET INTO A REALLY BIG MACS AND AND AT THE END OF THE YEAR I HOPE. THAT WE SUCCESSFULLY SORT IT OUT BECAUSE IT'S GONNA BE A REALLY TOUGH YEAR. ON ALL THIS STUFF RELATED TO ENERGY AND OUR ENVIRONMENT AND OUR FORESTS. AND EVERYTHING ELSE SO. IT'S IT'S HARD TO DO FROM THIS DíAS TODAY. WITHOUT REALLY LOOKING AT EVERYTHING IN COMBINATION BUT I THINK. WE'RE GONNA GIVE IT OUR BEST SHOT THIS YEAR SENATOR SKINNER FOLLOWED BY SENATOR DODD. AND SENATOR RUBIO AND THEN CENTER STUFF START. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. AND FORCE. FORCED TO THE AUTHOR -- I SUPPORT BALK [inaudible] ENERGY STORAGE [inaudible] AND MY PROBLEM RIGHT NOW IS HOW THE BILL'S CONCERT [inaudible] IS THAT. IT IS NOT TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL. AND IF WE IF OUR INTEREST IS TRYING. TO CREATE THE PLEXIGLAS IT'S TO BE ABLE TO DO THE BRIT INTEGRATION -- THAT WE KNOW WE NEED. THEN I THINK -- SOME AMENDMENTS OR AN AMENDMENT THAT WOULD ALLOW. FOR MORE TECHNOLOGY NEUTRALITY WHICH DOES NOT ELIMINATE. I'M PUMPED HYDRO FOR ELIMINATE A PARTICULAR PROJECT THAT MAYBE BEING CONTEMPLATED IT DOESN'T ELIMINATE THOSE BUT IT AT LEAST IF WE'RE GOING TO PUT SOMETHING IN THE STATUTE. ALSO PROVIDES. FOR THE OPPORTUNITY FOR OTHER TECHNOLOGIES AND I THINK WHEN WE LOOK AT WHAT WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO DO -- YOU KNOW THERE'S SOME CRITICISM THAT THE ART PS WAS NOT TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL ENOUGH BUT WE WE HAVE AT LEAST TRIED IN OTHER OF OUR BILLS. LIKE A TWENTY FIVE FOURTEEN THE ORIGINAL STORAGE BILL. TO MAKE A TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL NOW UNFORTUNATELY WHAT HAPPENED IS -- THE P. YOU SEE IN THERE ADMINISTRATION OF IT EXCLUDED PUMP HYDRO. SO THE WITH THIS BILL. WE COULD MAKE A TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL BUT STILL WE ARE SENDING A CLEAR SIGNAL THAT WE ARE NOT EXCLUDING PUMP HYDRO SO I WOULD BE FAR MORE COMFORTABLE. IF WE HAD -- LANGUAGE THAT DID THAT. AND ADDITIONALLY I THINK THE ARE REQUIRING IT TO BE THE A CERTAIN NUMBER OF MEGAWATTS IS PARTLY. WHAT CONTRIBUTED TO IT NOT BEING TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL AND I THINK IN TERMS OF THE COST? BY LOWERING THE MEGAWATTS BUT ALLOWING SOME FLEXIBILITY TO GO HIGHER [inaudible] IF I'D. THE R. P. YOUR I. SO SEIZE NEED FOR IT. IT BEGAN DOES A LITTLE MORE RATE PAYER PROTECTION. AND THEN FINALLY THE CONCERNED ABOUT FOR I THINK AND I SO IS VERY LEGITIMATE WHEN I THINK ABOUT LAST YEAR OUR DEBATE AROUND -- WHETHER WE WOULD REGIONAL I START THREADS. AND IF YOU'RE THAT IF WE WERE TO DISMANTLE THE CALL HI SO AS AS IT IT IS CURRENTLY -- CONSTRUCTED THAT WE WOULD BE INVITING BURKE FURTHER INTO OUR DIRECTLY INTO OUR FAIRS. WE KNOWN THAT. FOR BASICALLY IS THE REGULATORY AUTHORITY OF OUR CAL I SO. BUT ANYTHING WE EXPAND IN TERMS OF THAT ROLE CAL SO I SO WE ARE. IN FACT EMPOWERING FOR THAT MUCH MORE. SO -- WHETHER IT WILL HAVE THE NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES THAT SOME FEAR. CAN'T DETERMINE BUT CERTAINLY IF ARE CONCERNED IS THAT -- FIRST WOULDN'T NECESSARILY HAVE CALIFORNIA'S INTERESTS NUMBER ONE IT HARD. IT IS. IT IS -- IT CONSTITUENTS TURNING TO HAVE LANGUAGE THAT SO DEFINITIVELY -- IT INVITES BURKE IN THIS WAY SO THOSE WOULD BE MY CONCERNS WITH THE BILL AS CURRENTLY CONSTRUCTED. KERRY HAD A BIKE AND SENATOR SKINNER VERY GOOD POINTS -- IF I COULD. I'M SO THIS BILL IS ABOUT INFRASTRUCTURE WHAT IS MISSING IN A REGULATORY GAP RIGHT NOW OUR LARGE PROJECTS INFRASTRUCTURE SCALE PROJECTS. ARE TWO TWO LARGE FOR ANY LOAD SERVING ENTITY TO PER CARE -- IF WE MAKE THE PROCESS THE BILL SMALLER THERE'S NOTHING IN OUR CURRENT MARK STRUCTURE THAT KEEPS PEOPLE FROM BUYING SMALLER SCALE PROJECTS TODAY. ON THE P. YOU SEE ANALYSIS THAT LOOKED AT THE THIRTY MILLION TEN CARBON CENTER WHICH IS NOT THE ONE THEY DOCTOR THEY DROPPED A HIGHER CARBON TARGET SO FOR KIDS STAYING AT HIGHER CARBON TARGETS YOU DON'T YOU DON'T NEED THIS BILL. BUT IF FOR DRIVING TOWARD OUR CARBON GOALS THERE IS AN ANALYSIS OUT OF THE PC AND THE CDC THAT TALKS ABOUT THE NEED FOR STORAGE TO SUPPORT FOR INCREASES IN SOLAR. THE ECONOMY'S THE COST EFFECTIVENESS. OF BOOK ENERGY STORAGE WHICH IT FOUNDED EVERY SCENARIO. FOR AGGRESSIVE CARBON REDUCTIONS WAS THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE OPTIONS THAT WAS BASED ON SIZE. SO WE THERE'S NOTHING IN THE MARKET KEEPING SMALLER PROJECTS OUT TODAY IN FACT THIS IS A SMALL PROJECT MARKET. BUT IF WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO CAPTURE THE COST EFFICIENCIES OF LARGE PROJECTS THAT'S WHY YOU NEED THIS BILL. SO I WOULD ALSO POINT ON THAT ON THAT DEFINITION THAT WAS A NEGOTIATED -- DEFINITION WITH THE ENERGY STORAGE ASSOCIATION THAT REALLY WAS CRAFTED TO ALLOW IT TO MAKE IT TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL AND I WOULD POINT OUT THAT WHILE THERE YOU DO HAVE PUMP STORAGE PROJECTS SUPPORTING THE BILL. YOU ALSO HAVE COMPRESSED AIR AND YOU HAVE -- NEXT TRUCKER WHICH IS A LONG DURATION FLOW BATTERY. I DID WANT TO POINT OUT THAT THIS BILL IS VERY LONG TERM THE SINISTER GOING TO SEE A PROJECT ON LINE IS TWENTY THIRTY THE CYNOSURE GOING TO SEE ANY PROJECT HAD RATES IS TWENTY THIRTY THESE ARE TEN YEAR CONSTRUCTION CYCLES. SO WHAT WE'VE DONE IN THE BILL OR TRIED TO DO TO RECOGNIZE THIS AS SENATOR HERTZBERG REYES SOMETHING NEW CAN BE INVENTED. THE SOME GREAT IDEAS OUT THERE SO WHAT WE KNOW IS TO GET TO THAT EVEN A MODERATE CARBON TARGET AT THIRTEEN MILLION TONS AND WE KNOW THAT WE'RE HEADING TOWARDS ZERO AFTER SB. ONE HUNDRED YOU'RE GOING TO NEED AT LEAST TWO THOUSAND MEGAWATTS A LONG DURATION STORAGE BY. TWENTY THIRTY AND IF YOU GET TO HIGH ELECTRIC. SECTOR I'M TRANSMISSION TRANSPORTATION SECTOR YOU'RE GONNA NEED UP. TO FOUR THOUSAND SO WHAT WE DID IN THE BILL AND IN CANDIDATE PROBABLY COULD'VE BEEN CRAFTED BETTER SHE DO TWENTY THOUSAND TWO THOUSAND BY TWENTY THIRTY WHICH IS A NO BRAINER TO GET HER CARBON TARGETS. AND THEN YOU HAVE YOU HAVE A SECOND TWO THOUSAND FOR YOUR CARBON TARGET AT TWENTY FORTY FIVE AND IF SOMETHING NEW IS INVENTED IN THAT PERIOD IF THIS TURNS OUT TO BE A BAD IDEA OR SOMETHING. SOMETHING HAPPENS YOU CAN WE LOOK AT THAT. AND THAT THERE WAS A POSSIBILITY. COMES ALONG SOMETHING'S MORE COST EFFECTIVE WE DECIDE TO STEP BACK FROM THESE GOALS WHO KNOWS. BUT THERE IS A PAUSE BUILT IN THE BILL BUT WE GET THE TWO THOUSAND ON BY TWENTY THIRTY WHICH WE KNOW WE NEED TO REACH AT LEAST THE MINIMUM AMOUNT. OF LONG DURATION STORAGE TO SUPPORT OUR OUR PS GOALS. AND THEN WE LOOK AT THE SECOND -- TWO THOUSAND AND MAYBE EVEN THE DEFINITION IF WE NEED TO BROADEN NAPA DEFINITION IS NOT TECHNOLOGY SPECIFIC BY INTENT AND THAT'S WHY WE HAVE MULTIPLE TECHNOLOGIES SUPPORTING THE BILL. OKAY -- CENTER DOT. YES -- YOU KNOW WHEN I CAME IN HERE THIS MORNING I HAD EVERY INTENTION TO VOTING FOR AND SUPPORT IN THIS BILL I HEARD A LOT OF YOUR OMMENTS -- HERE ON IN OPPOSITION THAT CONCERNED ME. I ALSO -- ASSOCIATE MY COMMENTS WITH THAT. YOUR SENATOR HERTZBERG -- IT ALSO CENTER SKINNER VERY COGENT POINTS THEY BRING UP IT LISTEN TO MISS OUT OF X. -- YOU KNOW. DESCRIPTION THE FACT THAT THIS WOULD NOT HIT RATES IN TWENTY THIRTY AND ALSO. BECAUSE MANY OF THE PEOPLE THAT SPOKE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL ALSO SPOKE IN OPPOSITION TO SB. NINE OH ONE IT WILL PROBABLY SPEAK IN OPPOSITION TO WHATEVER BACKSTOPS WE HAVE FOR UTILITIES GOING FORWARD -- ON IMPORTANT PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE THAT REALLY AT THE END OF THE DAY ARE NOT. PROGRAMS TO SUPPORT UTILITIES ARE ONE COMPANY OVER THE OTHER BUT THERE TO PROTECT RATE PAYERS. SO I REALLY BELIEVE THAT I'M GONNA SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY TO LET IT GET OUT. TO ALLOW THE OPPOSITION TO BE ABLE TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR -- ON REFINING THIS BILL -- BUT YOU KNOW. I I REALLY THINK IT'S IT'S IT IT'S SOMETHING THAT -- YEAH THE ASSEMBLY THE GOVERNOR YEAH WILL BE BACKSTOPS TO THIS IF IT IS SOMETHING THAT THAT AT THE END OF THE DAY WITH WHAT WE'VE COME UP WITH. FOR UTILITY BACKSTOP THAT IT'S YOUR CONCERN BUT THE FACT THAT IT'S COMING UP -- IT WON'T HIT RATES TOLD -- TWENTY THIRTY I THINK WE DO HAVE SOME TIME -- TO YOUR TO WORK WITH THIS BUT I DID HAVE ONE QUESTION ON THIS BURKE SITUATION. THAT -- THE CONCERN ME AND I'M WONDERING MISTER WEST COULD GIVE SOME COMMENTS -- MISTER CHAIRMAN ON THAT'S FINE THAT SITUATION. THANK YOU SENATOR DIED SCOTT WHICH TO BE HAVE TO CALIFORNIA COALITION OF UTILITY EMPLOYEES. I THINK THIS DISCUSSION AROUND -- FOR HAS GOTTEN A LITTLE MURKY. FURK ONE THOUSAND ALREADY APPLIES. TO ALL THINGS TRANSMISSION HAS BEEN IN PLACE NOW. FOR EIGHT OR NINE YEARS. SO IN THE IN THE OLD DAYS IF P. JEANNIE FOR INSTANCE WAS GOING TO BUILD A NEW TRANSMISSION LINE AND IT WAS APPROVED BY CAL I SO. IT STILL HAD TO BE APPROVED BY. FOR AND FOR ACTUALLY TAKES OVER THE BID PROCESS. AND THERE HAS TO BE A COMPETITOR COMPETITIVE BID PROCESS THAT FOR CONTROLS -- THIS BILL DOESN'T CHANGE THAT EVERY TERROR OF THE IS SET ON THE TRANSMISSION SYSTEM. IS APPROVED BY FIRST WE DEAL WITH FOR WORK ON A DAILY BASIS THAT IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THAN THE DISCUSSION AROUND REGIONALIZATION WHICH HAD TO DO WITH COMPLETELY SUBVERTING OUR GOVERNMENTAL CONTROL OVER. THE WHOLE DECISION AND PLANNING. OF MAKING PROCESS THAT CAL IS SO SO THIS BILL DOESN'T EXPAND AND GIVE FOR KATIE GREATER REACH INTO CALIFORNIA IT'S COMPLETELY CONSISTENT WITH THE ROLE THAT FOR PLAYS EACH AND EVERY DAY INTERACTING WITH CAL I SO. ONE OTHER POINT I WANTED TO SAY TO THE EXISTING PROCESS HOLD ON JUST. CENTER DOT DOT ARE YOU NOT. OKAY YEAH -- SO YOU'RE LESS ALONE. I THINK YOU AND I APPRECIATED THE THE QUESTION ABOUT FOR I HAD THE SAME QUESTION I ALSO ONE IS THE SE -- THANK YOU TO THE CHAIRMAN FOR FOR HIS COMMENTS -- RIVERSIDE COUNTY HAS BEEN THE EPICENTER. FOR REALLY ALL FORMS OF RENEWABLE ENERGY AS A CHAIRMAN KNOWS. VAST SOLAR BASS GEO THERMAL VAST WIND. AND WE HAVE A COUPLE A LARGE -- STORAGE PROJECTS AND IN MY DISTRICT AND I HAVE ENJOYED WORKING WITH -- THE AUTHOR I'M A CO AUTHOR WITH THE BILL AND OF COURSE WITH EVERY BILL WE ALWAYS FIND IT OR SOME UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES AND THIS IS WHY. WE HAVE HEARINGS LIKE THIS TODAY TO HEAR -- THE OPPOSITION SO I I KNOW AND I'M CONFIDENT -- THE SENATOR BRADFORD IS A MAN OF HIS WORD HE'S GOING. TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION AND ALSO HE'S AWARE OF THAT -- WE HAVE SOME TRIBAL SACRED SITES -- IN ONE OF THE POTENTIAL PROJECTS AT THIS COULD -- DEFINITELY -- IMPACT AND AND I KNOW THAT YOU'RE GOING TO CONTINUE. TO TO WORK WITH THEM -- BUT IF IT LASER JENNIFER GONNA MEET OUR CLIMATE -- GOALS AND RENEWABLE ENERGY GOALS WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO HAVE A A LARGE CADRE OF OF TECHNOLOGIES AND FORMS OF ALTERNATIVE ENERGY AND I'M VERY PROUD THE RIVERSIDE COUNTY HAS TAKEN A LEAD IN. ON ALL OF THESE FORMS AND AND I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE SENATOR AS WE MOVE THIS FORWARD -- AND THROUGH THE PROCESS SO THANK YOU SENATOR FOR YOUR THINKING OUT OF THE BOX AND AND AND YOU'RE IN YOUR VAST ENERGY BACKGROUND. I'M IN SUPPORT OF THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- I THINK I'M THEM WITH WITH YOU. IN IN IN YOUR AND THE THRUST OF IT. IN TERMS OF NEED TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM. THE GAP THE DUCK CURVE -- THE BROADER SORT OF QUESTION ABOUT HOW TO GET THIS BE ONE HUNDRED AND SOME -- JUST HOW DO YOU GET THERE I MEAN REALLY I MEAN THAT THAT'S YEAH I DON'T THINK WE SOLVED THAT AND WE SOLVE MAYBE THEY'LL LIKE 80% OR 65% I STILL THINK WE SOLVE THE HUNDRED SO. HI I DON'T I'M I'M A LITTLE. I HESITATE ABOUT THE NUMBER THOUGH I THINK IS FOUR THOUSAND EVEN ENOUGH LIKE I I'M I'M CURIOUS TO KNOW WHAT. WHAT'S DRIVING THAT ANSWER THE TIMING THAT WAS MY FIRST QUESTION FOR YOU ALL LIKE WELL HOW DID HOW DID YOU GUYS COME OF FOURTH. THOUSAND I MEAN IF IF THE POPULATION KEEPS INCREASING LIKE. THEIR CHANCE WE'RE GONNA NEED MORE AFTER THAT. TWENTY THIRTY OR EVEN MORE BEFORE TWENTY THIRTY IT JUST ONE FOR SUCH AS NO THE LOGIC OF THAT. AND CENTER SENT THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION I AM SO THE ANALYSIS IN THE STATE WHETHER IT'S THE CPUC OR THE CC DID SOME REALLY GOOD WORK LAST SUMMER AND THEIR DEEP DEEP CARBONIZATION STUDY THAT LOOKED AT CARBON TARGETS ACROSS OUR ECONOMY -- IN THE FOUR THOUSAND IS DERIVED FROM THOSE TO THE CCC THE CPUC STUDY LOOKED AT TWO THOUSAND TO FOUR THOUSAND BASED ON A THIRTY MILLION TIME CARBON TARGET MEMBER WORDS ZERO NOW AFTER SB. ONE AND SO THEY FOUND THAT THE DIFFERENCE BUT WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TWO ONE FOUR THOUSAND IT'S THE AMOUNT OF ELECTRIFICATION WE HAVE IN OUR TRANSPORTATION SECTOR PREDOMINANTLY AND HOW MUCH NATURAL GAS WE KEEP ON THE SYSTEM. SO THAT FOUR THOUSAND IS SOMEWHAT ARTIFICIAL -- IT WAS ASSUMING REALLY TECH THEY WERE LOOKING AT PUMP STORAGE NOT THE BROADER SET OF LONG DURATION STORAGE TECHNOLOGIES THAT COULD COME FRWARD. AND THAT WAS JUST BASED ON GEOGRAPHY PUMP STORAGE IS YOU KNOW GEOGRAPHIC LOGICALLY DRIVEN AND SO IT THEY LOOKED AT THE NUMBER OF MY UNDERSTANDING IS EAT THREE LOOKED AT THE NUMBER PROJECTS IN THE FORK LICENSING AND SAID FOUR THOUSAND IS THE GEOLOGICAL MAX IN THE STATE. BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU WON'T NEED MORE LONG DURATION STORAGE IT DOESN'T MEAN OTHER TECHNOLOGIES MIGHT NOT COME FORWARD AND COULD SOLVE THE PROBLEM. BUT I THINK I THINK YOU'RE YOUR POINT IS REALLY WELL TAKEN. HOW WE GONNA GET THERE BECAUSE THIS IS NOT THE SILVER BULLET RIGHT IF YOU ADOPT THIS BILL? THAT'S IT'S GONNA ESSENTIALLY A QUAKE TO ABOUT THREE POINT THREE MILLION TONS OF CARBON REDUCTION A YEAR WHAT SEVENTY TWO GOING. TO ZERO SO THIS IS. ONE OPTION AMONG MANY YOU'RE GONNA NEED ENERGY EFFICIENCY YOUR NEED TO MANNER SPONSORED ANY BETTER OPTIMIZATION IN OUR MARKET. WE'RE GONNA NEED A DIVERSITY OF OUR RENEWABLE RESOURCES FOR CAN MEET A LOT OF THINGS INCLUDING SOME SHORT DURATION STORAGE IN SOME LOCATIONAL FOR MARCH. SO THIS IS JUST ONE AMONG MANAGER. SO SO THE OTHER TWO ISSUES THAT BEEN RAISED BY THE MEMBERS I MEAN I IS THERE A PATH HERE CAN WE CAN WE TRY TO FIGURE OUT AT LEAST SOME WAY TO STRUCTURE THIS WHERE. WE'RE NOT ARBITRARY CAPPING OURS ARBITRARILY CAPPING OURSELVES WE'RE DEALING WITH THIS PROPORTIONALITY ISSUE WHICH I I I APPRECIATE WHAT THE THE MUNY EASIER SAY IN AND SORT OF WE DON'T WANT THIS SOME SORT OF A IT'S IT'S GONNA BE UNEVEN WHO WHO NEEDS WHAT. AND SO I'M I'M SENSE IT I THINK ACTUALLY WIND BROUGHT IT UP TO THAT SORT OF TAILORING IT TO TEN NEED AND THAT SORT OF PROPORTIONALITY CONCEPT. THAT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE BLOWS UP THE BILL. THE TECHNOLOGY NEUTRALITY SEEMS LIKE THAT'S GOING TO GIVE YOU SPACE I DON'T THINK FRANKLY YOU WANNA SINGLE PROJECT BILL AND I THINK THAT. GOT TO BE REALLY CAREFUL ABOUT. THAT -- AND I I APPRECIATE YOU MENTIONED COMPRESSED AIR STORAGE BUT YOU'RE HERE SO I JUST THINK FOR THE INTEREST OF FOR JUST HOW WE MOVE POLICY. WE SHOULD TRY TO FIGURE THAT ONE OUT LIKE WHY DAILY CYCLE OF DISCHARGE LIKE WHY IS THAT THE THE METRIC -- WHY A FOUR HUNDRED AND NOT THREE HUNDRED OR TWO HUNDRED FIFTY OR TWO HUNDRED OR I MEAN I I APPRECIATE YOUR SAYING SMALL CAN GET IN NOW BUT? I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT ONE ALSO FEEL SORT OF ARBITRARY AND PUMP STORAGE ORIENTED SO DOES THE FOUR THOUSAND YOU SAID THE FOUR THOUSAND DRIVE FROM A FOR PROMPT STORAGE. STATE ANALYSIS AND THEN LET'S JUST LET'S SHADOW THAT LET'S HAVE THIS RELIABILITY CONVERSATION MAKE THIS THING IS SOME WE CAN BE PROUD OF I MEAN I I WANT TO VOTE FOR THIS THING I JUST. I NEED TO GET A SENSE OF WHERE WERE YOU GUYS WOULD WANT TO GO HERE AND HOW GRANULAR YOU WANT TO GET TODAY AND I DON'T WANT TO CONTRAVENE THE CHAIR EITHER IN ANY WAY I MEAN I JUST. I WANT A LITTLE MORE CERTAINTY BEFORE I VOTE AS OPPOSED TO JUST LIKE ALL RIGHT. THUMBS UP AND THEN OFF WE GO SO. IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR MAN TO TO ALL THOSE QUESTIONS TODAY WERE NOT WE DON'T HAVE THAT BUT IT'S THE ONGOING DISCUSSION A COMMITMENT WE MADE AND IT'S REFLECTED IN. THE CHAIRMAN'S COMMENTS AS WELL THAT WE'RE COMMITTING TO WORK. WITH ALL OF THE OPPOSITION AS WELL SUPPORTERS OF THIS BILL THE WEEK WEEK WE'VE BEEN PROMISED A THREAD THE NEEDLE. AND ADDRESS EVERYTHING TODAY BUT WE'RE CONTINUING AS WE ALL KNOW THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS AND ANY PIECE OF LEGISLATION IN SOMETHING AS COMPLEX AS THIS THERE ARE SO WE'VE HEARD TOO CONCERNED VERY CLEAR AND IT'S YOU KNOW IT'S NOT MISTER MAY THAT. WE STILL HAVE WORK TO DO TO MOVE FORWARD AND THAT'S A COMMITMENT I CAN MAKE THAT WE WERE. WE'LL DO OUR BEST TO ADDRESS ALL THOSE ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED. I JUST I NEED MORE I CAN'T I CAN'T GET THERE I CAN'T GET THERE IN THIS I KNOW. THAT WE'RE NOT LIKE SOME OF THE I KNOW THE FINER POINTS ARE HARD TO DRILL DOWN ON RIGHT HERE FROM THE DICE BUT LIKE. I CAN'T I CAN'T BE THERE UNLESS I KNOW WHERE THESE HAVE A SENSE EVEN FROM THE SPONSORS OR OR LABOR WHOMEVER. WE WANT TO BUILD YES WE WANT TO DO LONG DURATION BOOKSTORES YES. BUT TOO MANY TIMES EVEN TODAY THE WORD PROJECT HAS BEEN SET. AND THAT'S NOT THAT DOESN'T WORK LIKE I PEOPLE ARE SLIPPING -- PROJECTS WITH THE KIDS IN PROJECT THOUGH THOUGH HE FALLING INTO THAT THAT'S I CAN'T I CAN'T DO THAT -- SO WHAT WHAT I MEAN JUST FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE IS THERE SOME SIGNAL YOU CAN GIVE US IN TERMS OF JUST KINDA ITERATING WHERE YOU WANT TO HEAD OR WE JUST GOTTA KINDA. LAY OFF AND LET THIS THING OF ALL OF I DON'T KNOW  DON'T LIVE NEAR THE TWO PROJECTS OF THE MANSION. SO SAN DIEGO BUT YEAH WELL ALL -- WHAT WAS THAT THERE SO? THEY'RE NOT EVEN THERE THEY'RE NOT EVEN CLOSE I MEAN THEY JUST GOT STARTED. I MEAN I APPRECIATE THAT THE GETTING STARTED BUT I DON'T KNOW I JUST SEEMS LIKE THERE'S A WAY. TO IRON OUT AT LEAST A DIRECTION SO I KNOW WHERE WE'RE GOING. I DON'T MEAN. TO ALL RIGHT BE A PAIN VERY WELL. DID YOU WANNA MAKE CLOSING COMMENTS ARE I WOULD VERY MUCH LIKE. TO OF FIRST LET ME THANK YOU CHAIRMAN AGAIN FOR YOUR WORK IN YOUR STAFF WORK AND ALLOWING US TO BE HERE THIS MORNING. AND LET ME STATE. I DIDN'T RUSSIAN TO TAKE THIS. A MEASURE BECAUSE OF JUST WHAT HAPPENED TODAY. AND FROM MY PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE BUT IT'S ALMOST LIKE DEJA VU ALL OVER AGAIN BECAUSE MANY OF THE SAME CONVERSATIONS WE WERE HAVING IN TWO THOUSAND AND TEN IN. TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN AS WE PASSED SB. THREE THREE THIS IS THE MEDIAN OUR PS BILL AND WE CONSCIOUSLY MADE ARGUMENTS ABOUT THE BUCKETS AND HOW CAN STE -- RESTRICTIVE IT IT WAS AND HOW -- TECHNOLOGY SPECIFIC IT WAS IN PER SCRIPT IF IT WAS AND I WAS TRYING TO BROADEN THAT DISCUSSION AND SAY LET'S ADD IN RUN OF HYDRO FROM -- BC ALL NO WE CAN'T HAVE THAT WERE SENT LET'S LOOK AT OUT OF STATE -- GENERATION NO WE CAN'T HAVE THAT IT ALL HAS TO BE IN STATE AND WE'RE HERE TODAY BECAUSE OF SOME THE CONSTRICTIVE RESTRICTIVE LEGISLATION THAT WE PASSED IN A FIFTEEN YEARS AGO WHEN WE STARTED THIS WHOLE OUR P. S.. DISCUSSION. AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE NOW FIGHTING AMONGST EACH OTHER AT THE INDIVIDUAL WHO WORK FOR UTILITY I REMEMBER THE SAME ENVIRONMENTAL. FRIENDS WHO ASKED FOR RENEWABLE ENERGY TO ASK FOR WIND AND SOLAR WERE THE SAME ONES WERE OPPOSING THE TAX SHOULD BE POWER LINES AND THE SUN RISE POWER LINES ON A TO AND YOU'RE GOING. TO HAVE TO BE BUT HOW DO WE GET THE POWER FROM WHAT WE BUILT THE SOLAR FARMS TO THE PEOPLE WHO NEED IT SO. IT'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE THAT DANCE BETWEEN. YOU KNOW THE NEED E. N. COST AND IF THERE'S ANYONE THAT TO RATE HAWK IT IS BEEN ME AND I WAS VERY. YOU KNOW ADAMANT ABOUT WHAT WE WERE DOING ELEVEN YEARS AGO. WHAT OUR PS WHAT WE DID EIGHT YEARS AGO WHAT OUR PS WHAT THAT MEANT TO RATE PAYERS AND NO ONE SEEMED TO CARE AT THAT TIME BUT NOW THE SAID? REPAIRS ARE ALWAYS AT THE FRONT OF DISCUSSION AS WE TRY TO EXPAND WHAT WE STARTED. AND WHAT STARTED OUT AS SEVENTEEN CENT A KILOWATT HOUR ON SOLAR IN SOME PLACES WAS TWENTY FIVE WE ARE NOW DOWN TO FIVE CENTS A KILOWATT BECAUSE OF TIME AND GROWTH IN INDUSTRY TO GROW. SO AGAIN. FIRST PROJECT WON'T COME ONLINE TO TWENTY THIRTY WILL HAVE. PLENTY TIME TO ADVERTISE THIS AND AND AND AND AND AND AND COST IT OUT TO SEE WHAT IT IS WE'RE NOT TRYING TO IMPACT REPAIR. LE HAS IMPACTED REPAIRS OF THE LAST TEN YEARS AS OUR MOVE FROM COMBINED HEAT AND POWER ARE MOVED FROM A GAS ARE MOVED FROM. HYDRO TO WIND AND SOLAR THAT'S WHAT DROVE UP TO COST. OUR DESIRE TO BECOME GREEN CLEAN AND EFFICIENT. IT IS A COST FOR THAT. AND IT'S GONNA BE A COST FOR THIS AS WELL BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE WANT TO BE MINDFUL AND THOUGHTFUL AS WE MOVE FORWARD. AND ALL THOSE THINGS HAVE BEEN FACTORY AND AGAIN I TO RUSH TO NEW TECHNOLOGIES THAT WILL COME BEFORE US AND WE'LL HAVE THAT SAME DISCUSSION AGAIN. AS TO HOW DOES IT WORK WHO PAYS FOR IT YOU KNOW. WHO BENEFITS WHO SUFFERS BUT ACT THIS IS WHAT WE'RE HERE FOR TO TAKE ON THE TOUGH ISSUES I REMEMBER SENATOR SKINNER WHEN SHE HAD WON THE LARGEST BATTERY STORAGE BILLS? YOU KNOW AND WE'VE TRIED TO MAKE THAT WORK. THE WHAT WHAT WE WILL IF WE STORED YOUR STORED OKAY TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL BUT YES IT WAS BUT WE WERE WE WERE WORKING ON THAT THE TWO ONE WEEK WE JUST COULDN'T THREATEN NEED ON THAT BUT IT WAS SOMETHING THAT WE DON'T AND WE'RE HERE TODAY. DOING MUCH OF WHAT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT. EIGHT YEARS AGO. SO IT'S ABLUTION OF PROCESS AN AUNT AND DEVELOPMENT AND I THINK. WE ALL MUST AGREE IF WE'RE GOING TO BE AS GREEN AS WE COME -- COMMITTING AN AS CLEAN AS WE ARE COMMITTING. IT'S GOING TO TAKE. YOU KNOW LARGE STORAGE LIKE THIS IS GONNA TAKE POP POP HI JOE IT'S GONNA TAKE YOU GEO THERMAL PROJECTS AT THIS OUR CHAIRMAN HAS ADVOCATED FOR IT'S GONNA TAKE A VARIETY BUT AGAIN WE'RE FIGHTING EACH OTHER NOW BECAUSE OF HOW RESTRICTIVE. AND HOW PRESCRIPTIVE. OUR OUR PS WAS IN ITS INFANCY AND HOW IT IS OF OFF SO ON THAT NOTE I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIGHT MOTION. CLICK PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. SB SEVEN SEVEN TO DO PASSED TO APPROPRIATIONS WESO FIVE WEST SO I MORE LOCK BRADFORD FART BRADFORD I'D CHIANG. DODD. DODD I HERTZBERG HILL MCGUIRE RUBIO. IF I MAY CHERYL QUICKLY I'M SORRY HOW TO STEP OUT TO A RALLY THAT WE WERE HAVING OUTSIDE IS IT APPROPRIATE [inaudible] OKAY [inaudible] SKINNER [inaudible] STERN. STONE STONE AYE WIENER. CALL RUBIO AGAIN. OR CALL THE ABSENT MEMBERS AGAIN. AT MORE LACK CHIANG. HERTZBERG HILL. MCGUIRE RUBIO. GET RUBIO AYE AYE SKINNER STERN WIENER. WE'LL LEAVE IT THERE THE ROLE OF THE PROPS MEMBERS I THINK. I WILL CHECK UP SENATOR NIELSEN HAS BEEN WAITING VERY PATIENTLY -- AND WHILE WHILE WE DO THAT WE'RE GONNA CHANGE -- CHAIRMAN OF OF THE COMMITTEES THIS IS SO I CAN PRESENT A BILL CENTER DOT. ARE YOU INTERESTED IN RUNNING YEAH SURE [inaudible] GLORIA. CENTER NIELSEN I'D ITEM NUMBER TWO SP. SEVENTY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE AND THE CHAIRMAN FOR THE INDULGENCE OF WORKING WITH THIS IS WE PREPARED. THE BILL. THE RIDE WITH THIS COMMITTEE TODAY. I WOULD REQUEST UNFAVORABLE. THIS ADDRESSES ISSUES RELATED TO THE CATASTROPHIC. WILDFIRES VETERANS. AND GULPING OUR STATE. INCREASINGLY. OF INCREASING SEVERITY. MANY OF US OF VERY PERSONALLY DOES LEGISLATORS. THE HALF OF OUR CONSTITUENTS HAD TO CONTEND THE DEAL WITH THESE OVER THE YEARS. THERE WILL BE MANY. BILLS PROPOSED TO ADDRESS IT. THIS ONE ADDRESSES. A PARTICULAR AREA. BY REQUIRING THE ELECTRICAL CORPORATIONS. TECHNICALLY INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES. TO REPLACE THE ABOVE GROUND DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS. WITH UNDERGROUND RELIANCE WHEREVER THIS MIGHT BE PHYSICALLY. POSSIBLE AND FEASIBLE. IN AREAS WHERE IT WOULD BE OF GREATEST HELL. AND CONSISTENTLY SB. NINE OH ONE PLANTS THAT THEY'VE HAD PUT INTO PLACE. IT ALSO WOULD CREATE A WORKING GROUP TO ASSIST IN DIRECTING THE IMPLEMENTATION. OF A PLAN. FOR GOING UNDERGROUND. WHERE WE CAN? IN OUR CASE A MILLION GENERAL FUND DOLLARS. FOR THAT PARTICULAR PURPOSE. AGAIN I EMPHASIZE THAT. TO CUT DOWN ON THE DISASTROUS WILDFIRES MANY THINGS ARE GOING TO BE HAPPENING. OVER A PERIOD OF TIME. THEY WILL ALL FIT TOGETHER HOPEFULLY [inaudible] TO LESSON. THE BURDEN AND THE COST. WHAT'S YOUR INCREDIBLE. FIREFIGHTING COSTS OF THIS YEAR AROUND [inaudible] TWO HUNDRED FORTY TWO BILLION DOLLARS. ELEVEN POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS COST INSURERS TO THIS POINT. IN OVER FORTY SIX THOUSAND INDIVIDUAL CLAIMS. JUST DEALING. WITH LAST YEAR. MANY OF THESE FIRES OVER DECADES HAVE BEEN IGNITED. BY THE YEAH FOR STRUCTURE FAILURES. LINES COMING DOWN FOR EXAMPLE PARKING FIRES. THAT WAS A CONCERN. AND THE DOOR. IN THE CAMP FIRE. IN ORDER TO ENSURE THEN. OUR SAFETY TO THE DEGREE THAT WE CAN [inaudible] AND THE ASSURANCE OF CONTINUED SERVICE WHICH IS ALSO BEEN VERY DISRUPTED THIS YEAR AND VERY PROBLEMATIC. WOULD LIKE TO TRY. TO REDUCE THESE HAZARDS AND OPPORTUNITIES BY UNDER GROUNDING WHERE WE CAN'T. THEY'RE ALWAYS CONCERNS ABOUT UNDER GROUNDING IN THE COSTS BUT I THINK WE HAVE GOT TO WEIGH THESE CONCERNS. WITH THE OVERALL MACRO COSTS IN MANY FRONTS [inaudible] THESE FIRES. ARE IMPOSING ON US. AND CONSIDER. WHAT? TO WHAT DEGREE THE UNDERGROUND AND WILL ALLEVIATE SOME OF THAT VULNERABILITY. IT ALSO WOULD HELP US WITH THE COMMUNICATION BREAKDOWNS THERE HAVE BEEN SO SEVERE WITH MANY COMMUNITIES REMAINING ISOLATED FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME FROM THEIR COMMUNICATION. OPPORTUNITIES. IT'S SO IT'S A WAY OF HARDENING OUR INFRASTRUCTURE [inaudible] THE DID THE TENS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT THAT HAVE. BEEN SPENT AND UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS IMPACTING OUR RATE PAYERS. OVER A PERIOD OF TIME AND THAT IS A MACRO EXPENSE. THE STEALTH EXPANSE. BUT A HUGE. ONE NONE THE LESS. WE'RE WE'RE NOT GONNA AGAIN BE. LAYING OUT A PLAN TO UNDERGROUND EVERYTHING. BUT WE'RE TRYING TO LAY OUT A PLAN. UNDERGROUND WHERE WE CAN WORDS FEASIBLE [inaudible] WORDS ECONOMIC. WE'VE CONTINUED TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE LARGEST INVESTORS UTILITIES TO DISCUSS WITH THEM. THE ISSUES OF IMPLEMENTING IN. MAKING THIS WORK. AND RECENT AMENDMENTS WE'VE TAKEN. HAVE TIGHTENED THE PRESCRIPTIVE NATURE OF UNDERGROUND AND THE LINES AND CREATED SOME. CARVE OUTS. FOR THE PHYSICAL FEES VISIBILITY. AND THEN INCORPORATED THE PREVENTION PLANNING. INCORPORATED IN. SB NINE OH ONE OF LAST YEAR. I AM INFORMED OF THE WE HAD DONE WILL HAVE A DOCUMENT YET THAT THE CAL CHAMBER HAS REMOVED THEIR OPPOSITION [inaudible] THIS IS. NOT JUST A COMMONSENSE. SHORT SMALL STEP. IT IS A SIGNIFICANT STEP. TOWARDS THE FUTURE. AND IT IS AN AREA THAT WE HAVE NEGLECTED NEGLECTED FRANKLY OVER DECADES IN CALIFORNIA. I BELIEVE IT'S A USEFUL AN IMPORTANT TOOL. AND I WITHIN THE THAT ASKED THE BOARD VIA THE COMMITTEE TO ALLOW US TO MOVE THIS BILL ALONG. AND PERCY. THANK YOU SENATOR -- IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT YOU HAVE ACCEPTED THE COMMITTEE -- AMENDMENTS WE ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS I THANK YOU FOR THAT WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. THIS DOES STAFF PERSON OKAY. ANY WITH ANY -- OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION PLEASE COME FORWARD -- SEALER I'M IN OPPOSITION BECAUSE UNDER GROUNDING -- APPEARS TO ME TO BE. LIKE FOR BUILDING. PUTTING LIFE BOATS ON THE TANK PANIC AFTER ITS SALE TO FORD. TO GET THERE IN TIME. THERE'S A SB ONE SIXTY SEVEN WHICH I MADE A POSITION LETTER. TO AND YOU WILL SEE A PHOTOGRAPH. OF WIRE A SERVICE DROP. HERE IN SACRAMENTO SMUD AND DATA. IN THERE I'M POINTING OUT. THAT TO THAT SYSTEM WAS DESIGNED THAT WAY HAVE THE HAVE THE LOWEST COST. AND FOR THE LONGEST TIME. THAT SYSTEM WORKS VERY VERY WELL. AND THEN WE REMOVED AN INGREDIENT AT DE FACTO METHOD. A VERY EFFECTIVE DE FACTO METHOD -- AND THAT WAS HAVING SOMEBODY VISIT EVERY SERVICE CONNECTION ONCE A MONTH. WHEN YOU REALLY NEED TO PAY ATTENTION TO THIS? I WAS AT A AT SMUD RATE WORKSHOP. AND THEY'RE THEY'RE DOING IS THEY'RE GOING TO RAISE RATES FOR WHILE FIRE MITIGATION. AND I PRESENTED I SHOULD OR SHOULD HAVE BROUGHT THE PHOTOGRAPHS OF THAT. DATA SERVICE DROPPED. AND THEY DIDN'T THEY TOLD THEY TOLD ME THAT THIS IS RELATED TO THE UNDERGROUND BECAUSE THAT'S LIKE BUILDING LIFE -- FOR YOU ARE YOU ARE YOU. WHAT WHAT ABOUT EVERYBODY ELSE WHO WHO -- IT HASN'T HAD A FIRE YET OR WHATEVER ELSE YOU NEED TO FOCUS ON YOUTH CHANGE THE DESIGN OF THE SYSTEM. AND INADVERTENTLY REMOVE SOMETHING THIS IS WHAT THE KIND OF THINGS ACOSTA APOLLO. THIRTEEN IT'S A KIND OF THE IT'S THE KIND OF THINGS WHERE SOMEBODY GETS C CONSEQUENCE. BECAUSE THEY THINK -- WE CAN DO ALL THIS TO LIMIT TREE IN WHATEVER. YOU REMOVE THE FEATURE THAT WAS DE FACTO THEY COULDN'T BILL THE CUSTOMER YOU DON'T NEED ANY LAWS THEN. SOMEBODY WOULD GO TO EVERY EVERY SERVICE DROP ONCE A MONTH TWELVE TIMES A YEAR. AND ANY LEASE CATCH THAT PART AND IF THE END THIS IS AN ENTRY LEVEL JOB. SO YOU'VE GOT SOMEBODY WAP UP PLEASE OKAY I WANT EXPLAIN WHY THIS IS IS IS OKAY WE NEED A LONG EXPLANATION OKAY MAYWEATHER STAND. I AM DOING THIS ROUND ROUTE IS IS NOT GIVING SOMEBODY A LIFE. YOU'RE NOT CAPABLE IT'S TOO COSTLY YOU ALREADY HAVE UNDERGONE GAS. IF THAT IS NOT THE PROBLEM. THE CLIMATE IS NOT THE PROBLEM YOU'VE YOU'VE. CREATED AN UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE THINKING THAT YOU'RE MAKING SOMETHING BETTER THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS LEE S. OVER THERE WITH THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE WE WERE INITIALLY IN OPPOSITION -- PRIMARILY DUE TO THE COSTS AND CONCERNS ABOUT DUPLICATION WITH THE NINE ONE PROCESS WINTERS IN THAT THE AUTHOR IS TAKING THE AMENDMENTS OF THE COMMITTEE AND SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO RECEIVING THOSE AMENDMENTS AND REMOVING OUR OPPOSITION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE REALIZED THAT THAT WAS ACTUALLY A REDUNDANT TO PROVISION ANYWAY AND SO. I WAS. REMOVED. IT ANY -- OPPOSITION OTHER OPPOSITION SEEING NONE BUT WE HAVE A MOTION BY SENATOR STONE -- TURN IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE YEAH. HEARING NO COMMENTS WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE SENATOR I WOULD SIMPLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU WOULD CALL THE ROLL PLEASE. SB SEVENTY TWO PASSES AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS WESO MORLOCK BRADFORD CHIANG DODD AYE DODD AYE HERTZBERG HILL MCGUIRE RUBIO. HI RUBIO ICE SKINNER STERN STONE STONE AYE WIENER. NEEDS FOR THE WRESTLING OKAY WITHOUT WHEELS ON CALL THANK SENATOR. THE FIRST CENTER JACKSON WE HAVE ITEM NUMBER ONE SB. FORTY SIX GOOD MORNING. THIS MORNING [inaudible] STILL [inaudible] WITNESSES. GOOD MORNING UP MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. THIS IS A SUBJECT ABOUT WHICH I DON'T THINK I HAVE TO DO TOO MUCH -- PERSUADING FOR SENATOR DODD -- BUT THIS IS A BILL SB FORTY SIX THAT EXPANDS MY ALERT AND WARNING BILL FROM LAST YEAR. WHICH WAS BROUGHT ON BY. RESEARCH AND INFORMATION PERTAINED. PERTAINING TO THE FIRES UP IN. THE CENTER DODGE DISTRICT AND THEN SUBSEQUENTLY. IN MY DISTRICT AND THEN OF COURSE IN THE PAST YEAR AND JUST ABOUT. MANY OTHER DISTRICT HERE IN THE STATE. THIS BILL EXPANDS THAT A WAR -- ALERT AND WARNING SYSTEM BY ALLOWING CITIES. AND UNIVERSITIES TO AUTOMATICALLY ENROLL STUDENTS RESIDENTS AND EMPLOYEES IN LOCALLY OP. EMERGENCY ALERT SYSTEMS WHILE PRESERVING THEIR ABILITY TO OPT OUT. AND I AM TAKING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS THAT ARE REFERENCED IN THE ANALYSIS TO ASSURE. THE COULD TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANIES THAT THEY ARE ONLY. CALLED UPON TO PRODUCE INFORMATION THAT IS IN THEIR POSSESSION. THAT ANY INFORMATION THAT MAY BE MADE PUBLIC IS AGGREGATED INFORMATION THAT DOES NOT IDENTIFY AN INDIVIDUAL OR POSE A SECURITY THREAT TO THE PUBLIC. AND THAT NO PROPRIETARY BUSINESS INFORMATION WILL BE DISCLOSED. THESE AMENDMENTS I BELIEVE ALSO MEET CERTAIN. CONCERNS REGARDING THE USE OF THAT INFORMATION. KNOW WHAT IS IT WE'RE TRYING TO GET WITH THE USE OF THAT INFORMATION. WE WANT TO FIND OUT WHETHER THESE EMERGENCY ALERT SYSTEMS ARE WORKING. ARE PEOPLE ACTUALLY RECEIVING THE NOTICES THAT ARE GOING OUT. TO WARN THEM OF DANGER TO LIFE AND PROPERTY. SO THIS MEASURE CLARIFIES THAT ALERTING AUTHORITIES MAY USE WIRELESS TELEPHONE SUBSCRIBER DATA. FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF PROVIDING EMERGENCY NOTIFICATIONS. AND IT ALLOWS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO IDENTIFY RESIDENTS WITH ACCESS AND FUNCTIONAL NEEDS IN ORDER TO SEND THEM SPECIALIZED EMERGENCY ALERTS. THIS BILL ALSO REQUIRES TELECOMMUNICATIONS OPERATORS TO ANNUALLY PRODUCE DATA. CONCERNING THE PERFORMANCE OF WIRELESS INFRASTRUCTURE USED TO SEND THESE EMERGENCY ALERTS THE CALIFORNIA'S RESIDENTS. MEMBERS WE KNOW OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS MANY OF OUR DISTRICTS HAVE BEEN AFFLICTED BY THESE HORRIFIC WILDFIRES. TO THE COST OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS INTO THE COST OF FAR TOO MUCH IN HUMAN LIFE. A COMBINATION OF YEARS OF DROUGHT FUELS ACCUMULATION AND CLIMATE CHANGE AND DO SEVERE WEATHER. HAVE RESULTED IN WILDFIRES OF ABSOLUTELY UNPRECEDENTED SIZE AND INTENSITY. THAT HAVE KILLED OVER A HUNDRED PLUS CALIFORNIANS DESTROYED THOUSANDS OF HOMES. AND BURNED WELL OVER MILLION ACRES. THESE FREQUENT EVER FREQUENT. LARGE SCALE WILDFIRES HAVE FOCUSED ATTENTION ON HOW CALIFORNIA WARNS THE PUBLIC DURING AN EMERGENCY. OUR WARNING SYSTEMS COME IN A VARIETY OF FORMS AND EACH HAS SPECIFIC CAPABILITIES AND DRAWBACKS. SYSTEMS RANGE FROM RELATIVELY LOW TECH OPTIONS LIKE MAKING DOOR TO DOOR ANNOUNCEMENTS. ON FOOT FREQUENTLY BY LAW ENFORCEMENT. KNOCKING ON YOUR FRONT OR BACK DOOR. WHICH I'VE HAD HAPPENED IN MY OWN PERSONAL EXPERIENCE. TO OUTDOOR WARNING SIRENS TO AUTO DIALING TELEPHONE SECURE RELAY DETAILED IN FROM EMERGENCY INFORMATION TO HOUSES AND A BLOCK BY BLOCK LEVEL. ONE OF THE MORE MODERN ALERT SYSTEMS IN CALIFORNIA AND ACROSS THE WEST IS THE WIRELESS EMERGENCY ALERT SYSTEM CALL WE ARE. THIS IS ADMINISTERED BY THE FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION COMMISSION AND ALLOWS MOBILE PHONE SUBSCRIBERS TO RECEIVE GEOGRAPHICALLY TARGETED TAX LIKE MESSAGES ALERTING THEM OF IMMINENT THREATS TO THEIR SAFETY. IN THEIR AREA NOW WE A IS A VERY GOOD SYSTEM AND IS BEING. APPROVED BUT ACCORDING TO EXPERTS IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT NOTIFICATIONS BE MADE IN A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT MODES IN ORDER TO GROUP TO REACH THE GREATEST NUMBER OF RESIDENTS. SO WE CALL REDUNDANCY A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT WAYS TO NOTIFY PEOPLE SOME WHO DON'T HAVE WIRELESS SOME WHO DON'T HAVE A LAND LINES. IN THE OLD DAYS WE USED TO USE THE CHURCH BELLS WELL OBVIOUSLY WE LIVE IN A LITTLE FARTHER -- COMMUNICATIONS DURING THE THE HEIGHT OF THE RED SCARE THE RUSSIANS CARE WHICH I GUESS IS NO LONGER RISKIER. OUT WE HAD THE CONRAD SYSTEM READ HIS HIGH PITCHED EMERGENCY SOUND THAT WARNS YOU THAT THERE WAS DANGER COMING AT SYSTEM DOESN'T EXIST ANYMORE BUT IT HAS BEEN SUPPLANTED IN SOME MEASURE BY SYSTEMS LIKE THE WE ASSIST THEM. WE JUST NEED TO KNOW IS THIS WORKING. SO. MANY JURISDICTIONS SUPPOSE SUPPLEMENT THE WE IS SYSTEM WITH THEIR OWN LOCALLY OPERATED EMERGENCY NOTIFICATION SYSTEMS IN ORDER TO CREATE THAT REDUNDANCY AND TO ASSURE. MORE EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION WITH RESIDENTS DURING EMERGENCY THESE SYSTEMS SUCH AS NICK SOLAR CODE RED. IT CAN SEND PRE RECORDED MESSAGES TO LAND LINE TELEPHONES LOCATED WITHIN A DEFINED TARGET AREA AS WELL AS TEXT AND VOICE ALERTS TO MOBILE TELEPHONES. GIVEN THE UNIQUE ABILITY TO TARGET ALERTS USING PHYSICAL ADDRESSES LOCALLY OPERATED NOTIFICATION SYSTEMS ARE AMONG THE MOST PRECISE. AND SAFEST WAYS TO GIVE PEOPLE EMERGENCY NOTIFICATION SO THE PEOPLE KNOW WHERE THE PROBLEM IS WHAT THEY NEED TO DO TO PROTECT THEMSELVES AND TO AVOID THE KIND OF FEAR. OF A MASSIVE ONSLAUGHT OF PEOPLE HITTING THE ROADS WHICH DOESN'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO OCCUR OF PEOPLE ARE PRECISE IN THEIR KNOWLEDGE AND UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE. SO -- AGAIN THIS SUDDEN WE KNOW THAT BECAUSE REGISTRATION FOR EXAMPLE OF MOBILE PHONES. IT WAS NOT UNTIL RECENTLY AN AUTOMATIC PROCESS. MANY JURISDICTIONS STRUGGLE TO GET RESIDENTS TO SIGN UP TO RECEIVE AERTS THEY WERE OP THE IN YOU HAD TO MAKE THE EFFORT WHAT WE'VE DONE BY OUR PRIOR LEGISLATION THAT I WANT TO EXPAND ITS NOW AND OPT OUT SYSTEM. YOU WILL BE INCLUDED UNLESS YOU SAY YOU KNOW WHAT I DON'T WANT TO KNOW IF THERE'S AN EMERGENCY IN MY AREA. SO -- WHEN THE THOMAS FIRE BROKE OUT IN MY DISTRICT LITERALLY AFTER WE JUST CONCLUDED A HEARING? ON EMERGENCY ALERT SYSTEMS IT WAS THEN THE LARGEST WILDFIRE IN THE HISTORY THE STATE THAT STARTED IN DECEMBER ON HEARD OFF. FEWER THAN 30% OF THE RESIDENTS OF THE AFFECTED AREA HAD EVEN SIGNED UP TO RECEIVE COUNTY GENERATED CELLPHONE AN EAIL ALERTS. SO WE PASSED SB A TWENTY ONE LAST YEAR -- THAT INSURED RESIDENTS WHO DO NOT WISH TO RECEIVE THESE ALERTS CAN OPT OUT. OF THE MEASURE WAS A NECESSARY BUT A FIRST STEP TOWARD INCREASING THE PERCENTAGE OF RESIDENTS WHO RECEIVE EMERGENCY ALERTS FROM COUNTY OFFICIALS. BUT MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE AND THAT'S WHAT THIS WILL A BILL IS DESIGNED TO DO -- I WON'T GO INTO ANY GREATER DETAIL LIKE I KNOW THAT THE THAT YOU ARE PROBABLY ALL FAIRLY FAMILIAR WITH THIS PROCESS BUT I DO HAVE WITH ME TODAY RAYMOND REARED IN THE DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT. FOR THE CITY OF SAN JOSE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL FANTASTIC SIR. THANK YOU ARNOLD COMMITTEE CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE PANELISTS MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC ARE HERE TODAY. AND THANK YOU TO CENTER JACKSON FOR OF PROPOSING THIS LEGISLATION AND MOVING FORWARD. ON BEFORE I STARTED SAN JOSE OF AN EMERGENCY MANAGER AT SEVERAL LOCAL GOVERNMENT LEVELS THE SPECIAL DISTRICTS THE STATE AND FEDERAL LEVEL SOME VERY FAMILIAR WITH EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT PROTOCOLS AND ALERT AND WARNING. IN MY THIRTY THREE YEARS THAT I'VE BEEN A EMERGENCY MANAGER -- I'M VERY HAPPY TO SUPPORT -- AS THE LOCAL EMERGENCY MANAGER THE CONCEPT OF WHAT THIS BILL. PRESENTS AND PROVIDES FOR US -- ITS LOCAL JURISDICTIONS USING -- TELEPHONE DATA TO ACCESS AND SEND INFORMATION OUT TO THE PUBLIC TO WARN THEM OF THE EMERGENCIES. WE DEFINITELY DON'T WANT TO SEE THE FUTURE EVENTS CAUSED BY PEOPLE NOT BEING NOTIFIED. AND THE ASSISTANCE OF GETTING THIS DATA WILL ASSIST US IN GETTING THE RIGHT INFORMATION OUT TO THE RIGHT PEOPLE THE RIGHT TIME. PARTICULARLY THOSE WITH ACCESS AND FUNCTIONAL THESE BECAUSE WE NEED TO ADDRESS THOSE VULNERABLE POPULATIONS UNDERSTAND. THEIR VULNERABILITIES AND PROVIDE THE RIGHT ALERTING WARNING SO THAT WILL PROVIDE THEM A SENSE OF SECURITY. THAT'S INTO MINE THANK YOU. OUR WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR KLUCZBORK HERE WE HAVE A SANTA BARBARA COUNTY SANTA BARBARA COUNTY WAS DEVASTATED BY THE THOMAS FIRES. AND I WANT TO MENTION THE RESULT IN MUD SLIDES WITH FOLKS IN ESSENCE WAKING UP AT THREE OR FOUR IN THE MORNING -- WITH LIFE THREATENING MUD SLIDES COMING DOWN THE CANYONS WE THINK THIS BILL IS AN IMPORTANT STEP IN ENSURING EMERGENCY NOTIFICATION SYSTEM AN URGE YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. MORNING CHAIR I MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE RUBBER TO GO HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CITIES -- ONE I THINK THE THE CENTER JACKSON'S LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE. WE THINK THIS BILL HAS POTENTIAL TO SAVE LIVES AND FOR THEIR FOR THOSE REASONS WE ARE IN SUPPORT THANK YOU THANK YOU. WHAT THIS IS IN OPPOSITION? MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS ABERDEEN ROSCOE CALIFORNIA CABLE AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS ASSOCIATION -- CCT A IS OPPOSED TO THIS MEASURE. WHAT IT WOULD DO IS REQUIRE A COMPREHENSIVE REPORTING? USE USE YES SIR COULD YOU MAKE ROOM FOR THE WITNESS BEHIND YOU. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. UP WELL THIS -- MEASURE WOULD REQUIRE COMMUNICATION SERVICE PROVIDERS TO PROVIDE COMPREHENSIVE REPORTING TO THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. ON A THIRD PARTY PRIVATE VENDOR OPERATE WROBEL CALLING MACHINE -- RIGHT NOW I THINK CENTER JACKSON DID A VERY GOOD JOB EXPLAINING THE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF EMERGENCY ALERTS SO THE NATIONAL LEVEL WE HAVE -- THE A. S. AND THE EMERGENCY ALERT SYSTEM WHICH IS BROADCAST ON RADIO AND TELEVISION ON VIDEO AND THAT GOES TO EVERYONE YOU DON'T NEED A DATABASE YOU TAKE GOES OUT YOU RECEIVED THAT NOTICE SAME THING WITH WE A NOW THE WIRELESS EMERGENCY ALERT ALSO AUTOMATICALLY GOES OUT AND HIT. CELL TOWERS YOU DON'T NEED A DATABASE THAT GOES OUT AND EVERYONE WAS SEND THE RANGE OF THAT CELL TOWER WE'LL GET THAT EMERGENCY ALERT. WHAT THIS PROPOSAL DOES IS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THERE ARE OVER FOUR HUNDRED I'M HAVE WANT TO GO OUT AND HIRE A THIRD PARTY VENDOR -- THAT WILL USE A DATABASE OF WROBEL CALLING MACHINE. THAT WILL INITIATE PHONE CALLS FOR COMMUNICATIONS SERVICE PROVIDERS THAT RUBBLE CALLING MACHINE IS JUST ANOTHER PHONE CALL GOING THROUGH THERE'S NO MEASUREMENT OF WHAT WE DO WE WE WILL MONITOR TRAFFIC FLOW GENERALLY AT OUR OPERATING CENTERS. BUT THIS IS THIS IS REALLY NO OTHER TYPE OF NO DIFFERENT THAN ANY OTHER PHONE CALL THIS GOING OVER THE NETWORK. SO WE ARE REQUIRED TO DO A CONFERENCE REPORTING ON THE METRICS OF THROUGH PUT AN ERROR RATES THOSE THINGS ARE NOT DEFINED IN THE BILL I I'M NOT SURE WHAT YOU'RE ASKING ME TO DO. IT IN THAT REPORT AGAIN THIS THESE THESE ARE JUST NORMAL CALL TO GO THROUGH THE NETWORK. WE'RE LOOKING AT ERROR RATES WHATEVER THAT IS LOOKING FOR THROUGH PUT WHATEVER THAT IS. AND SO WHAT WE HAVE TO PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION YOU SEE. NOW THE PC DOES NOT HAVE A ROLE IN EMERGENCY ALERTS THAT IS A ROLE THAT IS GIVEN TO THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES SO THE ANNOUNCES THAT A VERY GOOD JOB. OF EXPLAINING WHAT -- YES DOES THIS COMMITTEE AND THIS LEGISLATIVE BODY LAST YEAR UNANIMOUSLY PASS SB EIGHT THREE THREE AND THAT WAS NOTED IN YOUR ANALYSIS. THAT SAYS -- YES YOU NEED TO GO BACK TO WORK WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS BECAUSE WE'RE DISCOVERING ISSUES LOCAL GOVERNMENTS NOT KNOWING. WHEN TO SEND OUT ALERTS HOW TO SEND OUT ALERTS AND HOW THE HOW WE SHOULD BE COORDINATING WITH COMMUNICATION SERVICE PROVIDERS? SO -- YES IS NOW ADOPTED SOME GUIDELINES THAT ARE IN DRAFT FORM THAT JUST CAME OUT COUPLE WEEKS. CC T. A. N. S. MEMBERS WILL BE MEETING WITH -- YES NEXT WEEK TO GO OVER THOSE GUIDELINES TO LOOK AT HOW WE CAN IMPROVE THE EFFICIENCY OF COORDINATION WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WHEN THE WORDS ARE ISSUE. WE WOULD SAY THAT THIS MEASURE IS PREMATURE AT THIS TIME. THE REPORT THAT WE GO TO THE P. YOU SEE I'M NOT SURE WHAT IT WOULD DO WHAT WHAT THE QC DO WITH THAT INFORMATION. ITSELF SUCH INFORMATION REVIEW PROVIDED IT SHOULD BE PROVIDED -- TO YES AS THE APPROPRIATE AGENCY. BUT FOR THESE REASONS CCK IS OPPOSE. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS SAYS THE CARLSON AT CTIA THE WIRELESS ASSOCIATION. THANK GOD MISTER ROSS GO HIT ON A LOT OF THE POINTS THAT THE THAT I WAS GOING TO MAKE I I DID WANT TO COMMEND THE THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS WHICH WAS WHICH WAS QUITE COMPLETE -- I I DO WANT TO KIND OF FOCUS ON THE FACT THAT WITH SB EIGHT THIRTY THREE IS SORT OF A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO LOOKING AT LOCAL STATE FEDERAL. WARNING WARNING ISSUES WE BELIEVE -- THIS BILL IS -- IS DUPLICATIVE OF THAT. THERE'S NOTHING THAT THIS BILL REQUIRES THAT CAN'T BE DONE THROUGH THE EIGHT THIRTY THREE PROCESS -- AND THAT EIGHT THIRTY THREE PROCESS IS RUN BY A BY -- YES I'M AND CAL FIRE. WE HAVE REMAINING CONCERNS ABOUT THE THE PRESUMPTION OF CONFIDENTIALITY THAT IS REVERSED I'M IN THE BILL -- AND AND THAT THAT THAT'S REMAINING CONCERN. WE BELIEVE THE BEST WAY TO HANDLE THESE ISSUES IS FOR THE RIGHT FOLKS TO SIT AROUND A TABLE AND WORK THROUGH ON EVEN TODAY WIRELESS CARRIERS ARE WORKING TO FINALIZE A MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING WITH -- YES AND WORKING PROPERLY WITH CAL FIRE. TO ENSURE THAT INFORMATION FLOWS LIKE THESE SORTS OF ISSUES ARE PROBABLY TAILORED -- TO THESE AGENCIES NEED A WE LOOK FORWARD TO LOOKING AT THE AT LANGUAGE ON THE AMENDMENTS AS THEY BUT RIGHT NOW WHICH WE CONTINUE -- TO TO OPPOSE THE BILL. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS BILL DIVINE AND I REPRESENT AT AND T. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE. I'LL TRY TO KEEP MY COMMENTS BRIEF FIRST LET ME COMMEND THE AUTHOR OF THE BILL BECAUSE CLEARLY THE OBJECTIVE HERE IS ONE THAT WE WOULD ALL SUPPORT. IN FACT SECTIONS ONE TWO AND THREE WE OF THIS BILL WE THINK ARE ARE IMPORTANT AND USEFUL FOR CONTINUED EXPANSION OF EMERGENCY ALERTS TO CITIZENS. ARE OBJECTIONS ARE IN SECTION FOUR AND IN SECTION. FIVE PREFERRED TO THE ISSUE OF FLIPPING THE PRESUMPTION. THE SENATOR COMMENTED ON THE NEED FOR PROTECTING PROPRIETARY NETWORK INFORMATION THE P. YOU SEE RECENTLY WITHIN THE LAST TWO YEARS ADOPTED NEW RULES NEW PROCEDURES -- SIXTY SIX D. THAT OUTLINES DUE PROCESS FOR THE PROTECTION OF INFORMATION. IT IS WORKING EVERYONE PARTICIPATED AND SO BOTH THE PUBLIC AS WELL AS REGULATED ENTITIES HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK THROUGH CHALLENGES SO WE BELIEVE PRESERVING THAT SYSTEM. A WORKING SYSTEM PROTECTS THE CONFIDENTIALITY AND LIMITS CONFLICT CLOSER TO BE YOU SEE BUT THE OTHER ISSUE IS BECAUSE THAT SYSTEM IS SO WELL DESIGNED. THE P. YOU SEE IS GETTING ALL OF THE INFORMATION THAT THEY REQUEST PERIOD WITHOUT EXCEPTION. HAVING THE PRESUMPTION FLIP TO EVERYTHING'S PUBLIC. NOW PUT ALL YOUR INFORMATION AT RISK BECAUSE YOU ARE NEVER SHORT TO BE YOU SEE WILL EVER REVIEW IT. AND BLOCK EXPOSING. IMPORTANT PROPRIETARY FOR NETWORK INFORMATION SO THAT YOU WANT. THE SECOND PART OF SECTION FOUR THAT WE OBJECT TO IS THERE'S A FUNDAMENTAL FALSE PREMISE IN THE BILL. AND THAT IS THAT THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY. HAS CONTROL OVER ALL EMERGENCY ALERT ECOSYSTEM. WE DO NOT AS THE SENATOR AS HIGHLIGHTED WE HAVE THE WE A SYSTEM WHICH IS A BROADCAST SYSTEM. THAT SOFTWARE ITS LOCAL GOVERNMENT CONTROL ITS ENGAGEMENT WITH FEMA AND WHEN THOSE ANNOUNCEMENTS ARE BROADCAST A BROADCAST OVER THE WIRELESS NETWORK BUT IT'S NOT A PHONE CALL. IT IS A BROADCAST EVERYONE IN A CELL SECTOR IDENTIFIED BY THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT. ACTUALLY WILL GT THE ALERT AND THE WAY YOU TEST WHETHER THE ALERTS HAVE ARRIVED IS THE U. SURVEY MECHANISM AT FEMA AND SOME OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE DONE SO AS WELL. THEY FINE THAT WE END UP HITTING UPWARDS OF 80%. OF ALL THE CITIZENS WITH A WIRELESS DEVICE IN THAT AREA YOU MIGHT ASK WHAT ABOUT THE LAST A PERSON HAS TURNED OFF THEIR PHONE WHERE THEY DISABLED THE EMERGENCY ALERT OR THEY MAY ACTUALLY. NOT HAVE THE PHONE WITH THEM OR MAY NOT EVEN RECALL THE GOT THE ALERT BECAUSE THEY'RE ESCAPING A DANGEROUS SITUATION -- SO THE WE'LL ALERT IS THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE AND ITS OPT OUT AUTOMATICALLY ON YOUR PHONE RIGHT NOW. SO YOU HAVE TO OPT OUT OF THAT SYSTEM SO IT IS THE SUPERIOR SYSTEM. AND IT ACTUALLY WORKS INCREDIBLY WELL BUT THE KEY HERE LOCAL GOVERNMENT ACTUALLY HAS TO ISSUE THE ALERT. AND THAT HAS BEEN AN ISSUE IN THE PAST -- QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT WERE RECENTLY ANSWERED IN A CAL ONLY A STUDY FROM LAST YEAR. AND IT AND I'LL QUOTE THE TECHNICAL SYSTEMS FOR ALERT AND WARNING DISSEMINATION APPEAR TO A FUNCTION ADEQUATELY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CINEMA IN THIS INSTANCE. ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING THE SEVERE IMPACTS OF THE EVENT ON TELECOMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE SUCH AS CELLULAR RADIO. REPEATER SITES AND INTERCONNECTING FIBER CABLES THE POINT IS THE SYSTEMS WORKS AND IT'S BEEN ACKNOWLEDGED BY -- YES SO WE'D LIKE TO TRY TO FIX SECTION FOUR REMOVE SECTION FOR AND MOVE FORWARD WITH THE BILL. AND AGAIN I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR THESE ARE IMPORTANT ISSUES WERE AT THE TABLE WORKING WITH EVERYONE. BUT THE WAY THE BILL'S CURRENTLY CRAFTED WE HAVE TO OPPOSE UNLESS AMEND THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ANY OTHER OPPOSITION OFF THEIR NOT OPPOSITION I KNOW POSITION ACTUALLY WHICH WON THE THINK THE AUTHOR IN THE COMMITTEE I BELIEVE THEY'LL BE A TECHNICAL AMENDMENT -- INCLUDED AND THEN AMENDMENTS TAKEN TODAY PATRICK WHAT FOR THE CALIFORNIA MUNICIPAL UTILITIES SENSATION PATCHWORK OF THE AUTHOR AND HER WONDERFUL STAFF -- TOBY WHO AND FORTY IS NO LONGER -- WITH US IN THE LEGISLATURE WHEN HE WILL BE MISSED AT BUT IT THIS TECHNICAL ISSUE BEING RESOLVED THANK YOU VERY MUCH [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] MEMBERS ARE [inaudible] DID YOU. DID YOU WANNA MAKE ANY CLOSING COMMENTS [inaudible] OR CENTER REFERENCE. YEAH I'M I'M JUST LOOK. TURNER HAVE A QUESTION AS IT RELATES TO YOU. AGAIN THE TELEPHONY COMPANIES TO TELECOMS AND CABLE COMPANIES. HALL THEY WILL GATHER THAT DATA BECAUSE THEY'RE NO MORE THAN THE HIGHWAY I MEAN THEY'RE JUST THE YOU KNOW THE PIPE FOR THE ROLE THAT THE PHONE CALL IS ORIGINATED ON BUT IT'S ORIGINATOR OF THE PHONE CALL WHO HAS THAT DATA IS JUST NO MORE LIKE YOU SAY THAN. A ROLL CALL THAT WE MIGHT DO AND WE GET BACK A PRINT OUT OF SAND NUMBER OF CALLS ANSWERED THE NUMBER OF CALLS FAILED BUT THE TELECONFERENCE. THE CABLE COMPANY DOESN'T HAVE THAT INFORMATION WELL ACTUALLY THEY CAN GET THAT INFORMATION SO FOR EXAMPLE -- UNFORTUNATELY. THE WE IS SYSTEM. KINDA WORKS BUT I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MANY PEOPLE JUST ANECDOTALLY NEVER GOT THE OUIJA -- NOTIFICATIONS. ARE AT SO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS TIGHTEN THAT UP FIGURE OUT WHY. I'M AND WHAT EXTENT TO WHAT EXTENT SO THIS BILL BASICALLY AND WE'VE TAKEN ALL THE AMENDMENTS REQUESTED ABOUT -- TRADE SECRETS AND THINGS THAT REALLY HOT BUT THIS BILL IS DESIGNED TO DO. THIS BILL IS DESIGNED TO CREATE A SYSTEM TO MAKE SURE THE PEOPLE GET NOTIFICATIONS. AND THERE ARE THERE ARE. WAYS TO DO THIS THERE ARE -- THING SO WE DO ON THE LOCAL LEVEL SO YOU GET A NICK SOUL. NOTIFICATION FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT THAT THERE IS AN EMERGENCY EVENT ABOUT TO HAPPEN. THEY SIMPLY ASK YOU TO CONFIRM RECEIPT. SO YOU HIT YES. AND THAT'S REALLY BASICALLY ALL WE'RE ASKING OF THE INDUSTRY IS TO IDENTIFY. WHETHER OR NOT -- PEOPLE ARE -- GETTING THESE WE ALERTS SO ESSENTIALLY IT'S SAYING COME ON FOLKS -- IT GETS YOU KNOW. ARE THESE ALERTS BEING RECEIVED BY THE WELL THAT WE INTEND TO RECEIVE THEM BECAUSE THIS IS A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH. TO BE ABLE TO LEAVE THE CIRCUMSTANCES ARE TO GET OUT OF HARM'S WAY TO KNOW THAT THERE'S A PROBLEM. AND I I WOULD HOPE THAT THE THE THE FELLOW FROM. THE CITY. WHO IS HERE WITH THE STATE? ALL RIGHT WELL -- OKAY SO OF OF MY APOLOGIES BUT HE'S ACTUALLY BEEN DOING THIS KIND OF THING HE THERE ARE SOME CITIES AND SOME. AREAS AND ARE DOING THIS BETTER THAN OTHERS AND ONE OF THE HOLES IN ALL OF THIS THAT WE FOUND. HAS BEEN WITH THE WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS MOST PEOPLE NOW DON'T OPERATE USING LAND LINES SO THE QUESTION BECOMES HOW WE GONNA NOTIFY THEM AND ARE THESE NOTIFICATIONS AFFECTED. SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO. I FIND IT KIND OF INTERESTING THAT. THEY'RE THEY'RE HAVING DISCUSSIONS WITH -- YES -- AND OTHERS BUT NOT HAVING DISCUSSIONS WITH. WITH THE AUTHOR THIS BILL I THINK MOST PEOPLE ARE WE'VE BEEN HAVING DISCUSSIONS ARE I KNOW THE TERM. OF MY FRIEND FROM EIGHTEEN TEASE ROLLING HIS EYES -- I NOTED THAT -- BUT WE GAVE THEM ALL THE YOU KNOW THE FIRST SET OF REQUESTS HAD TO DO WITH ALL OUR TRADE SECRETS AND ALWAYS HAD FUNDING WILL TAKE THOSE MOMENTS WE'VE TAKEN THEM. OF THE GOAL HERE IS TO TRY TO SAVE LIFE AND IT'S MY HOPE AND EXPECTATION THAT IN SPITE OF THESE CONCERNS. THEY DON'T LIKE THE PC CAN'T SAY I BLAME THE WILL WORK WILL FIND ANOTHER WAY TO DO THIS THAT'S WHY WE'RE WILLING TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATIONS. AND IF LOOKS COULD KILL I KNOW RIGHT NOW BE DEAD ABOUT. TEN BUT THE IMPORTANT THING HERE IS THAT THIS IS A MATTER OF PUBLIC SAFETY. THIS IS A MATTER SAFETY WHEN YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH WHAT WE'VE BEEN THROUGH IN MY DISTRICT WHAT YOU HAD HAPPEN IN SAN DIEGO SEVERAL YEARS AGO WITH CENTER DAUGHTERS HAD WHAT MANY OF US ARE HAD. WE NEED TO MAXIMIZE THE VARIOUS A REDUNDANCIES IF YOU WILL TO GIVE PEOPLE THE WARNING THAT THEY NEED SO I WILL PLEDGE TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH. MY GOOD FRIENDS FROM EIGHTEEN T. ON THIS AND TO MAKE SURE THAT WE COME UP WITH SOMETHING. THAT MEETS THE EXPECTATIONS WE DON'T WANT TO CAUSE THEM. TO HAVE TO REVEAL INFORMATION WE WANT THEM TO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION HERE. AND THAT'S WHY THIS BILL. HAS COME FORWARD WE HAVE TO WE HAVE TO DO WHAT WE CAN TO PROTECT THE PEOPLE THE STATE AND I BELIEVE. THAT -- THE WIRELESS INDUSTRY THE CABLE INDUSTRY ALL OF PART OF THE SOLUTION I'M HAPPY TO CAN'T CONTINUE WORKING WITH THANK YOU DID YOU HAVE ANY ELSE SENATOR WILL IS OKAY FOR EXCEPT THOSE OF HIS YOUR QUICK CLOSING COMMENT THAT IS CORRECT SOMETHING LIKE CLOSING COMMENTS TO ME. AND DO WE HAVE A MOTION. WE HAVE A MOTION. PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. SB FORTY SIXTY PASSES AMENDED TO APPROACH. HUESO I WAS SO I A MORE LOT BRADFORD. BRADFORD I'D CHIANG DODD HERTZBERG. HILL.

SO WE WILL TAKE UP ITEM NUMBER EIGHT SB. FIVE FOUR NINE THANK YOU FOR WE WHILE WE'RE AT IT JUST TO MOVE THE CONSENT CALENDAR. WE HAVE A MOTION THIS CALL THE ROLL. SB ONE NIGHT. SB. ONE NINE NINE DO YOU PASSED TO APPROPRIATIONS. WESSEL. I WAS SO I MORE LACK BRADFORD BRADFORD AYE KING DODD HERTZBERG KILL. HI. I MCGUIRE RUBIO SKINNER STERN STONE WIENER. OKAY WE'RE GONNA GO TO S. ITEM NUMBER EIGHT SB. SB FIVE FOUR NINE WELCOME. THANK YOU WELCOME BACK AT THE END OF THE DISTINGUISHED GUESTS TODAY. FUTURE THANK YOU WHEN THAT WHEN P. JEANNIE ANNOUNCED ITS PLAN MYSELF INCLUDED. STATED NOT ONLY OUR CONCERNS BUT OUR HOPE. IT'S CERTAIN PRINCIPLES ARE UP HELD DURING THE PROCESS. WILL SUCH AS ENSURING FIRE VICTIMS ARE COMPENSATED. REPAIRS ARE PROTECTED AND THE SAFETY AND RELIABILITY OF OUR ELECTRIC AND GAS SERVICE. IS IMPROVE. WE ALSO NOTED ARE CLIMATE CHANGE EFFORTS IN THE IMPORTANT ROLE THE UTILITIES PLAY IN OUR EFFORTS TO GREEN THE GRID. I HEARD LOUD AND CLEAR FROM MY COLLEAGUES THAT WE WANT TO HAVE SOLUTIONS AND WE WANT TO HAVE A VOICE IN THIS BANKRUPTCY. SB FIVE FORTY NINE IS THE WAY WE CAN DO THAT. SB FIVE FOURTEEN I REQUIRES THE CPUC TO SEEK AUTHORIZATION FROM THE LEGISLATURE. PRIOR TO APPROVAL OF RATE CHANGES FOR P. JEANNIE THIS WAS CAUSED CONCERN FOR SOME OF YOU REGARDING THE APPROPRIATENESS OF THE LEGISLATURE REGULATING RATES. IT'S IMPORTANT WE REMEMBER THAT THE LEGISLATURE UP. CREWS OF UTILITY RATES ALL THE TIME. WE PASS LAWS FOR SPECIFIC PROGRAMS ARE GOALS WITH THE CPUC MUST ADJUST RATES TO IMPLEMENT. SOMETIMES WE OUT RIGHT REQUEST THE CPUC TO RAISE OR LOWER RATES OR EVEN OVERTURN A SEE IF YOU SEE RATE DECISION. WHAT IS CONTEMPLATED IN THIS BILL IS NO DIFFERENT? THE LEGISLATURE HAS PLENARY POWER AFFORDED TO IT BY THE CONSTITUTION OVER THE CPUC. AND SPECIFIES THAT QUOTE PUBLIC UTILITIES ARE SUBJECT TO THE CONTROL BY THE LEGISLATURE. SB FIVE FORTY NINE IS NOT MEANT TO BE PUNITIVE AGAINST THE CPUC ORDERS PROCESSES BUT IT ISN'T MEANT TO IT'S MEANT TO BE A CHECK. ON THE CD USUALLY ENDED TWO IS A SERVE OUR OVERSIGHT AUTHORITY GRANTED BY THE CONSTITUTION AFTER THE ELECTRICITY CRISIS IN P. GENIES TWO THOUSAND AND ONE BANKRUPT. THE CQC TOOK MEASURES TO IMPROVE THE CREDIT RATING OF OF PGD. THIS IF YOU SEE AUTHORIZED A RATE OF RETURN ON EQUITY OF NO LESS THAN ELEVEN POINT 22%. UNTIL P. GENIES CREDIT RATING IMPROVE. YET EVEN ONCE P. GENIES CREDIT RATING IMPROVED IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN THREE DO YOU SEE ANOTHER FIVE YEARS. BEFORE THEY ADJUSTED THE RATE OF RETURN BACK DOWN TO WHAT IT WAS PREVIOUSLY. NOW I'M I HAVE MORE CONFIDENCE IN THE CPUC TODAY. I BELIEVE WE HAVE SOME OF THE BEST COMMISSIONERS IN THE HISTORY OF THE CPUC PUBLIC SERVANTS WHO ARE THOUGHTFUL AND CARING AND BALANCE SAFETY AND AFFORDABILITY AND RELIABILITY. OF ENERGY SERVICE. BUT WE AS LEGISLATORS HAVE OVERSIGHT. BUT EVERY DAY WHEN EVERYONE'S GOALS ARE IN HARMONY THIS OVERSIGHT FUNCTION IS UNDERSTANDABLY MINIMAL. BUT WE SHOULD NOT SEE THE R. OVERSIGHT AUTHORITY. NOW IN THE HOPE THAT THIS HARMONY REMAINS I UNDERSTAND THAT THE CONSEQUENCES SEE MORE HEIGHTENED BECAUSE P. GENIE IS IN THE MIDST OF BANKRUPTCY. COLLEAGUES THAT IS THE VERY REASON WE SHOULD BE INVOLVED. NONE OF US WANT PEACE YOU NEED TO EMERGE FROM THIS BANKRUPTCY ON CHANGE WE WANT A SAFER MORE RELIABLE AND AFFORDABLE UTILITY. IT IS RESPONSIVE TO CALIFORNIA'S NEEDS THAT IS WHY ARE FULLY VOICE. THAT'S WHY OUR VOICES SO CRITICAL IN THIS PROCESS ULTIMATELY OUR INVOLVEMENT IN THIS BANKRUPTCY. IS COMING TOWARD US NO MATTER WHAT. IS THE GOVERNOR STRIKE FORCE PLAN HIGHLIGHTED WE ALREADY HAVE MANY QUESTIONS BEFORE. BEFORE US THE TOUCH ON RIGHT GREAT MAKING AND LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT OF THE CPUC SO WE CAN EITHER BE BACKED INTO A CORNER. AND FORCED TO SIGN ON TO A DEAL COMING FROM A GROUP OF PREDATORS OR WE CAN TAKE A FIRM HAND IN THIS. OUR CONSTITUENTS DESERVE OUR LEADERSHIP SB FIVE FORTY NINE IS OUR OPPORTUNITY TO DEMAND BETTER. IT DOES NOT PRESUPPOSE THE FUTURE OUTCOME OF THE BANKRUPTCY OR OTHER RATE MAKING OCCURRING AT THE CPUC. THE LARGEST TO HAVE A ROLE. IN WE SHOULD HAVE A YOU HAVE A WITNESS I DO THANK YOU. SO. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- I AM JERIT ALLIANCE I'M A PROFESSOR AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA HASTINGS COLLEGE OF THE LAWN SAN FRANCISCO AND I'M HERE TO DISCUSS -- SB FIVE FORTY NINE SO TO JUST TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF MY NVOLVEMENT WITH THE BILL -- MY INVOLVEMENT WITH THIS -- BILL IN THIS IDEA CAME WHEN I RECEIVED A CALL FROM SENATOR HILLS OFFICE PRIOR TO P. JEANNIE I'M FINE FOR BANKRUPTCY I'M JUST LOOKING FOR SOME INFORMATION ON HOW BANKRUPTCY WORKED -- AND WE TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN IN THIS BANKRUPTCY CASE AND THEN -- HOW PARTY SORT OF EXERT INFLUENCE IN BANKRUPTCY IN THOSE DISCUSSIONS THAT LED TO THIS BILL AND IN THE DISCUSSIONS I HAD WITH SENATOR HELENA STAFF I RELIED ON MY RESEARCH INTO BANKRUPTCY BARGAINING? MY KNOWLEDGE OF LARGE BANKRUPTCY CASES FROM WORKING AS A PRACTICING BANKRUPTCY LAWYER I'M PRIOR TO MY TRANSITION INTO ACADEMIA AND SPECIFIC PRECEDENCE OF HOW FEDERAL AND STATE GOVERNMENT HAVE EXERTED INFLUENCE OVER THE BARGAINING PROCESS. THAT EMERGES FROM CHAPTER ELEVEN SO I FIRST THOUGHT ABOUT HELP HOW PRIVATE PARTIES OF TEEN INFLUENCE OVER BANKRUPTCY CASES MORE GENERALLY ON BANKS TYPICALLY ACQUIRE ENORMOUS POWER OVER THE CHOICES THAT A DEBTOR MAKES IN CHAPTER. ELEVEN BY MAKING ATTACHING CONDITIONS TO THE EXTENSION OF FINANCING TO ALLOW THE COMPANY GO TO GO THROUGH BANKRUPTCY ON THESE LOANS OFTEN COME WITH CONDITIONS THAT SAY FOR EXAMPLE -- IF YOU WANT TO FILE FOR BANKRUPTCY WILL GIVE YOU SOME MONEY BUT YOU HAVE TO SELL OF YOUR ASSETS WITHIN NINETY DAYS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. I'M BY ACQUIRING THAT CONTROL THE THAN SHAPE THE BANKRUPTCY OUTCOME THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY WHAT ENDS UP HAPPENING BUT THE FACT THAT THE BANK HAS ACQUIRED THAT RIGHT ON THEN SHAPES THE BARGAIN THAT DOESN'T MERGING THE BANKRUPTCY CASE. IN THEIR TWO PROMINENT EXAMPLES -- RECENTLY OF HOW GOVERNMENT'S RESHAPED BANKRUPTCY OUTCOMES -- ONE IT CAME FROM THE GENERAL MOTORS CASE -- WHICH FAMOUSLY FILED FOR BANKRUPTCY IN TWO THOUSAND NINE THE DEPARTMENT OF TREASURY FOLLOWED THE BANK PLAYBOOK AND I'M CONDITIONS THE EXTENSION OF FINANCING TO ALLOWED HIM TO GET THROUGH BANKRUPTCY -- ON GM FOLLOWING A PRESCRIBED COURSE OF EVENTS THAT MATCH CERTAIN FEDERAL GOVERNMENT POLICY GOALS THINGS THAT THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION WANTED TO HAPPEN IN THOSE WHEN TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF ELECTRIC VEHICLES -- KEEPING AMERICAN WORKERS WORKING KEEPING AMERICAN PLANTS -- ROLLING ON GM WAS GIVEN AS A CONDITION OF THIS FINANCING THREE DAYS AFTER THE BANKRUPTCY FILING TO INITIATE AN AUCTION PROCESS -- FIVE DAYS AFTER THAT TO GET AN ORDER FROM THE JUDGE APPROVING IT AND ANOTHER THIRTY FIVE OR SO DAYS TO HAVE THE SALE APPROVED -- GM MEMBERS FROM BANKRUPTCY SHORTLY THEREAFTER -- IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WAS ABLE TO PROTECT UNIONIZED WORKERS AND PENSIONERS IN THE UNION CONTRACT I'M IS ALL THE SUPPLY CHAIN AND HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS O AMERICAN JOBS. ON THE CITY OF DETROIT FILE FOR ITS OWN BANKRUPTCY IN TWENTY THIRTEEN AT THE TIME THE STATE OF MICHIGAN'S LEGISLATURE TOOK THE POSITION THAT WE'RE NOT GIVING A BAIL OUTS TO THIS SORT OF FISCALLY IRRESPONSIBLE CITY -- BUT THEN THE REPUBLICAN LEGISLATURE BEGAN TO SEE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ACQUIRE -- POLICY ACHIEVEMENTS THROUGH MAKING CONTRIBUTION TO THE BANKRUPTCY CASE AND SO THE STATE OF MICHIGAN ENDED UP CONTRIBUTING THREE ENGINE FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS TO THAT BANKRUPT HE'S CASE TO FACILITATE. A GRAND BARGAIN THAT AMONG OTHER THINGS PROTECTED TRAITS PRICED OUR COLLECTION -- BUT ATTACHED TO THAT CONTRIBUTION -- WAS A REQUIREMENTS THAT UNIONIZED WORKERS AND PUBLIC SECTOR UNIONS GIVE UP MORE THAN THEY WOULD HAVE OTHERWISE INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO SUE SOME OF THE CONCESSIONS THEY'RE BEING ABLE FORCED TO MAKE. IN COURT SO BY ACQUIRING INFLUENCE IN THE BANKRUPTCY CASE ON THE REPUBLICAN DOMINATED LEGISLATURE IN MICHIGAN WAS ABLE TO ADVANCE POLICY GOALS THAT THEY HAVE LONG HELD SUCH AS WEAKENING PUBLIC SECTOR UNIONS -- HOW IS THIS BILL DIFFERENCE FROM THESE PRIOR GOVERNMENTAL INTERVENTIONS THE FIRST IS UNLIKE GM OR OTHER PROMINENT BANKRUPTCY CASES THIS ISN'T DISCUSSING ACQUIRING INFLUENCE OVER THE BEGINNING OF THE BANKRUPTCY CASE THE PROVISION OF FINANCING? P. JEANNIE WAS ABLE TO GET MONEY FROM THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND THEY DON'T NEED MONEY FROM YOU TO ALLOW THEM TO BE IN BANKRUPTCY ON THEY WILL HOWEVER MOST LIKELY NEED TAX PAYER RATE PAYER MONEY LATER. WHICH MEANS THAT THE GOVERNMENT'S CASH INFUSION WILL COME LATER IN TIME LEADER IN TIME SOMETIMES MEANS THAT YOUR BARGAINING POWER ENDS UP BEING MORE LIMITED THAN IT WOULD HAVE BEEN HAD YOU SORT OF SHAPE THE COURSE OF CONDUCT FROM THE BEGINNING -- IT SO HERE WE ARE TRYING TO USE THE BACK END OF THE CASE IN STATING RIGHT NOW HOW THE TO THE EXTENT YOU WANTS TO RAISE RATES -- OR GET A CAPITAL STRUCTURE JUST MEANT I'M YOU'RE GOING TO NEED TO THE CONSENT IN SUPPORT OF THE LEGISLATURE -- IN SACRAMENTO BY STANDING BETWEEN P. JEANNIE AND THE EXIT FROM BANKRUPTCY YOU CAN TELL TO THE PLAYING FIELD IN FAVOR OF THE INTEREST YOU CARE ABOUT WHETHER IS PUBLIC SAFETY A REPAIRS OR ANYTHING ELSE. TAXPAYERS AND RATEPAYERS ARE NOT REPRESENTED AT THE BANKRUPTCY BARGAINING TABLE DIRECTLY -- THIS BILL WILL CAST A SHADOW OVER THE P. JEANNIE BANKRUPTCY THAT WILL CHANGE THE RELATIVE BARGAINING POWER OF DIFFERENT PARTIES AND RESHAPE THE BANKRUPTCY BARGAINING TERRAIN -- IMPORTANTLY I BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL WILL START TO CAST THAT HADOWS TODAY HOPEFULLY WHEN THIS BILLS PASSED OUT OF COMMITTEE AND THE PARTIES WERE NEGOTIATING REALIZED. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT MIGHT BE OUT THERE IN THE FUTURE THAT THEY NEED TO TAKE ACCOUNT OF AND COMING TO AGREEMENT ABOUT WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN IN THE BANKRUPTCY CASE AND WHO IS GOING TO MAKE WHAT SACRIFICES. I'M CALIFORNIA HAS ALWAYS BEEN A LEADER ON A NUMBER OF ISSUES AND USING STATE LAW IN A WAY THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH FEDERAL BANKRUPTCY LAW. TO RESHAPE BANKRUPTCY OUTCOMES USING EXPECTED BACK AND CONTRIBUTION IT'S JUST ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF CALIFORNIA INNOVATING AND CREATING A PRECEDENT THAT OTHER STATES CAN FOLLOW WHEN THEIR OWN UTILITIES GRAPPLE WITH CLIMATE CHANGE -- I WORRY ABOUT TWO SITUATIONS IN PARTICULAR -- THE THE BARGAINING TABLE DIRECTLY SO IT'LL BE VERY EASY FOR ALL THE PARTIES WERE AT THE BARGAINING TABLE TO COME UP WITH A PLAN OF ORGANIZATION THE CONTEMPLATES A LARGE CONTRIBUTION EITHER IN THE FORM OF LIABILITY RELIEF -- A CHANGE LIABILITY ENVIRONMENT FOR A RATE INCREASE -- AND THAT MAY COME TO BACK TO THIS COMMITTEE A YEAR FROM NOW WHEN P. GENIE HAS ALREADY ABSORBED MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED OR SO MILLION DOLLARS ON LITIGATION EXPENSES WHEN WILD FIRE VICTIMS WERE ALREADY WAITING TO GET PAID -- ARE EAGER TO GET SOMETHING -- INTO NEW MAY FACE A SITUATION WHERE THE BANKRUPTCY JUDGE SUPPORTS THE DEAL -- IN THE THE PARTIES INCLUDING P. GENIE IN THE BANKRUPTCY CASE MAY TRY TO USE BANKRUPTCY PROCEDURE TO MAKE IT HARDER FOR YOU TO ASK FOR A DIFFERENT DEAL OR TO ASK TO RENEGOTIATE. WHAT IS GOING ON SO THE RATIONALE BEHIND THIS BILL IS THAT BY PASSING THIS BILL YOU'LL SIT IN THE BACKGROUND OF THE MEETINGS THAT ARE ALREADY GOING ON AND PARTY'S WILL UNDERSTAND THAT I. P. GENIES I COULD THROUGH BANKRUPTCY? RUNS THROUGH THIS BUILDING -- AND THE SECOND REASON WHAT THE SECOND THING THAT I WORRY ABOUT IS THAT THE CQC IS ALREADY ACCORDING TO THE SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE MOVING FORWARD ON A RATE INCREASE THAT WE CALL TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS A MONTH. FOR EVERY HOUSE IN THE P. JEANNIE SERVICE AREA FOR JUST THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN WILDFIRES PURSUANT TO ASKING I'M NINE A ONE ONE COULD EASILY IMAGINE A BANKRUPTCY PLAN THAT WOULD SATISFY BANKRUPTCY LAW. THAT'LL PAY WHILE FOR VICTIMS PENNIES ON THE DOLLAR I'M ON THE GROUNDS THAT P. GENIES NEEDS USE ALL OF ITS EXISTING ASSET BASE I'M TO SELF INSURE AGAINST FUTURE WILDFIRES. PLAN WOULD BE LEGAL -- IN APPROVAL BY THE BANKRUPTCY JUDGE IN THE C. P. U. C. WITHOUT YOUR INPUT AND PERHAPS EVEN WITHOUT TO THE C. P. HOW I GUESS THEY PROBABLY STILL WITH ME THE CPC. ON THE THREAT OF THIS PLAN CAN MAKE IT CHALLENGING NOT TO GET P. JEANNIE LIABILITY REFORM OR OTHER LEGISLATIVE RELIEF ON THE TERMS THAT THEY WANT TO A PART IN THE GOALS THAT YOU HAVE. ON THIS IS A POWER THAT ONLY YOU IS THE LEGISLATURE HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO ON THECBS POWER YOU KNOW COMES FROM THIS BODY IT'S DELEGATED TO THEM THE GOVERNOR. STONE IT REALLY RESTS WITH THIS BODY. THANK YOU ANY OTHER SUPPORTERS. WE HAVEN'T ANY OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. JUST GENERALLY MY COMMENTS -- I APPRECIATE THE THE THE ANECDOTES. IN MICHIGAN AND WITH FORD OF THE CITIES HAVE CERTAIN PROTECTIONS OVER STATES AND AND ANY OPPORTUNITY PENETRATE THAT I'M SURE SOME STATES WOULD TAKE THAT OPPORTUNITY IN THE DETROIT EXAMPLE. THANK CALIFORNIA CHARTER CITIES ARE THERE CERTAIN AREAS WERE NOT EVEN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA COULD EXERT. INFLUENCE OVER CHARTER CITIES. IN CERTAIN AREAS. BUT WE HAVE INFLUENCE AND OTHERS. OVER A PRIVATE CORPORATION LIKE LIKE -- GENERAL MOTORS OR FORD OR ANY ANYTHING LIKE THAT YOU KNOW WHEN YOU GET INVOLVED IN THE PROMOTE PER PER NIGHT. PROVIDE THE FINANCING YET GIVE YOU OUT THE OPPORTUNITY COME IN. AND AFFECT. INTERNAL OPERATIONS. BUT IN THE CASE FOR UTILITIES A P. YOU SEE AS OUR DIRECT -- REGULATOR. AND IN A BANKRUPTCY THY'RE INVOLVED. IN THE BANKRUPTCY PROCESS AS YOU CLEARLY STATED IN YOUR PRESENTATION OF BANKRUPTCY AND THAT IS THE WAY. THE STATE [inaudible] SPECIALIZES REGULATORY REVIEW. WITH ONE ORGANIZATION AND AND IF. YOU HAVE AN ORGANIZATION THAT ALREADY PROVIDING [inaudible] THE EXPERTISE. AT A SIGNIFICANT COST TO THE RATE PAYERS. AND TO THE UTILITIES EVERYBODY IS PAYING FOR THIS PROCESS WE'RE GETTING SOMETHING FOR OUR MONEY. AND ON TOP OF THAT WE'RE GOING TO ADD ANOTHER REGULATORY. REVIEW. YEAH I THINK THAT IT'S IT'S A RISK REDUNDANCY. THAT IS NOT NECESSARY BECAUSE IT'S ALREADY BUILT INTO THE PROCESS -- NONE THE LESS -- AGAIN THIS IS A VERY SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCE I THINK IT DESERVES. A CONVERT TO A YOU KNOW A CONVERSATION IT DESERVES -- A DEBATE A DIP. AND NEW AND INTERESTING AND IDEAS NEED TO BE. AARON REVIEWED THIS ISN'T A NEW AN INTERESTING IDEA -- TO OUR DELIGHT OF THE LEGISLATURE DEALS WITH EVERYTHING. WITH EVERY ISSUE. AND WE'RE BOMBARDED WITH EVERY ISSUE AND AND IT'S HARD TO BECOME A TECHNICAL EXPERT ON EVERY ISSUE IS JUST IMPOSSIBLE. AND I AND THEN WHEN YOU AND CALIFORNIANS REPEATEDLY HAVE VOTED. FOR CITIZENS LEGISLATURE ANYTIME. CALIFORNIANS CONVERT FOR TERM LIMITS THERE FOR THAT. THEY DON'T WANT CAREER POLITICIANS THEY WANT. THEY WANT THE AVERAGE CITIZEN RATE OF COMMAND. AND AND TO MAKE DECISIONS. AND WHAT IS BAD BEST FOR THEIR BEHALF SO. IT'S HARD TO GET. IT IS HARD TO GET OF EXPERTS IN ANY ONE ISSUE AND IF WE DID THEY'D BE AN EXPERT IN ONE ISSUE AND NOT AN EXPERT IN. AND LOTS OF ISSUES AND THAT'S WHY THE THE FOR ME THIS BILL. IT IS REALLY HARD HARD THING FOR ME TO CONTEMPLATE. AS AS THE RIGHT COURSE OF ACTION BUT BUT AGAIN OF THE CENTER HILL YOU ARE AT THIS POINT OF THE ERA THE THE POINT OF THE SPEAR ON THIS. ON THIS ISSUE IN THIS IS AFFECTING YOUR CONSTITUENTS MORE THAN SUFFICE EVEN IF IT'S AFFECTED MINE IT'S NOT AFFECTING MINDS. MUCH IS AFFECTING YOURS AND AND THIS BANKRUPTCY IS AS A MAJOR MATTER. AND AND I WANT TO CONTINUE TO SUPPORT YOUR WE WORK ON THIS. AND AND CONTINUE TO HAVE THIS DEBATE ABOUT -- THE LEGISLATURE'S WRONG BANKRUPTCY -- I BELIEVE. THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD HAVE A ROLE IN THIS BANKRUPTCY AND I BUT I I HOPE THAT THE P. YOU SEE IS IS ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN ADVOCATING FOR OUR INTERESTS AND WE'RE GONNA BE. WATCHING DIED AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE SOLUTION IS BUT HOPEFULLY WE CAN CONTINUE TO TALK ABOUT THE CENTER HILL. IN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS AND I I ABSOLUTELY AGREE WITH YOU AND AND MEN'S -- OR I THINK SO. SPOT ON ESPECIALLY WITH THE FACT THAT. IF WE LOOK AT THE GOVERNOR HAS A STRONG ROLE HAS THE BULLY PULPIT. CAN USE THAT MINISTER IN TERMS OF ACTUALLY. BEING ABLE TO AFFECTED THE BANKRUPTCY IT'S DIFFICULT AND CHALLENGING. THE P. YOU SEE -- HIS AND HE HASN'T MADE THOSE APPOINTMENTS -- YET SO IT'S IT REALLY IS INCUMBENT UPON US TO BELIEVE THAT TO AT LEAST HAVE A ROLE TO BE ABLE TO BE HEARD AND TO BE ABLE -- TO BECAUSE WE DO REPRESENT THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA SO THANK YOU I WILL TAKE THAT THAT YOU COULD ME USE THAT AS A CLOSE BUT I THINK YOU MAY HAVE. I APPRECIATE THAT VERY MUCH THANK YOU -- THIS ARE YOU INTERESTED IN MOVING THIS BILL. NO I DON'T WISH TO MOVE THE BILL THANK YOU FOR THE AND THAT EVEN AS A CHRISTIAN -- I I JUST TO HAVE SOME CONCERNS SENATOR HILL OKAY FIND SHARE FOR OPENING THE OPPORTUNITY FOR ME TO SPEAK -- THANK YOUR HEAD YES -- I'M MORE OF A NO BETTER NO WORSE KIND OF PERSON SO I'M WONDERING WHY JUST P. WE'RE DOING A FOR PEACH YOU NEED TO SET THE SCENE IS THE ONLY UTILITY. CURRENTLY IN BANKRUPTCY. AND THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. AUTHORITY OVER THAT BANKRUPTCY IS ONLY LIMITED TO RATES AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND RATE SETTING IS GOES FORWARD. THOSE THE BANKRUPTCY WILL BE REFLECTED IN THOSE RATE INCREASES IN CHANGES AS IT MOVES OUT OF BANKRUPTCY THIS GIVES THE LEGISLATURE THE OPPORTUNITY IN THAT. PARTICULAR CASE. TWO OF TO HAVE A VOICE TO BE ABLE TO MAKE COMMENTS AND IN EITHER VOTE UP OR DOWN AND SUPPORTING UP ORDER OF THAT. WHAT THE PROFESSOR COMMENTED ON WHICH I THINK WAS A VALID IS? BY US BEING. IN THE PROCESS OF THIS BILL MOVING. FORWARD IT DOES IT ALLOWS. FOR THE WHICH WE WILL HAVE A PRESENCE IN THE BANKRUPTCY CONVERSATION BECAUSE OF THAT. KNOWING THAT THE LEGISLATURE WILL HAVE SOME SAY. IN THAT I THINK IS CRITICAL. IF THEY LISTEN TO THE CONCERNS A WE'VE REYES. SINCE THE BANKRUPTCY FILING WITH THE PROTECTION OF REPAIRS PROTECTION OF THE FIRE VICTIMS. OF PROTECTIONS OF THE THE THE WORKERS AT THE F. P. JEANNIE. AND OUR ENVIRONMENTAL AND RENEWABLE ENERGY PORTFOLIO ALL OF THOSE THINGS NEED TO BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION AND NO ONE IS MORE PASSIONATE ABOUT THAT AREN'T REALLY I BELIEVE IN REALITY KNOWS MORE ABOUT THAT THAN MEMBERS OF THIS LEGISLATURE AND AND WHAT DID. AND I APOLOGIZE I'M JUST JUMPING IN HERE. ONE DAY YOU'RE HAVING. WHO WOULD THAT THE BILL PREVENT P. JEANNIE FOR MAKING POLITICAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO LEGISLATORS DURING THIS THIS? THANK YOU. THE THE BILL DOES NOT HAVE THAT PROVISION IN. THANK YOU THANK YOU CENTER THANK YOU [inaudible] I'M WILL. THIS IS OUR MOTION ON THIS CENTER HERTZBERG. OKAY CLERK PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. SB FIVE FOUR NINE DO PASSED TO APPROPRIATIONS WESSEL FIVE WAS SO I MORE LAST NO MORE LIKE NO BRADFORD CHIANG. DIED HERTZBERG HERTZBERG AYE HILL AYE HILL AYE MCGUIRE RUBIO SKINNER STERN STONE WIENER. ITEM NINE SB. FIVE FIFTY CENTERVILLE. SB FIVE FIFTY PROVIDES ADDITIONAL CRITERIA FOR THE CQC CONSIDER AND WE'RE DOING A PROPOSED CORPORATE RESTRUCTURING TO ENSURE SAFE SERVICE. OF THE SUCCESSOR ENTITY THE PUBLIC UTILITIES CODE ALREADY LIST RIGHT THE COMMISSION MUST CONSIDER PRIOR TO AUTHORIZE ANY CORPORATE RESTRUCTURED. THESE CRITERIA INCLUDE IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF SERVICE PROVIDED ECONOMIC BENEFITS TO RATE PAYERS. IRVINE THE JURISDICTION OF THE CHIEF USUALLY AND MOST RECENTLY ADDED UNDER SB NINE OH ONE LAST YEAR IT'S FAIR AND REASONABLE. TO AFFECTED PUBLIC UTILITY EMPLOYEES DESPITE THESE FOR IF YOU'RE IN NO FORMAL REQUIREMENT THERE'S NO FORMAL REQUIREMENT. THAT UTILITY RESTRUCTURING PRESERVED AND IMPROVED SAFETY. THIS TODAY DURING THE LEGAL OWNERSHIP CHANGE IN FEBRUARY OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AT THE GIL BRANDT STORAGE FACILITY LOCATED FRESNO AND MADERA COUNTIES THE NOTION OF SAFETY CULTURE. AS LIKE AS A CRITERIA FOR APPROVAL EMERGE. I HOLDING COMPANY FILED AN APPLICATION TO ASSUME LEGAL OWNERSHIP OF THE FACILITY. THE OFFICE OF SAFETY ADVOCATE PROTESTED THE APPLICATION OVER CONCERNS IT'S SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS WERE NOT BEING ADDRESSED. THE HOLDING COMPANY ULTIMATELY REACHED A SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT WITH -- AS A THAT INCLUDED THEIR DESIGNATING THE CHIEF SAFETY OFFICER CREATING A PIPE RIGHT SAFETY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM -- IN ALL OF THAT WAS DONE IN CHANGE THE CONDUCT CAUGHT SAFETY CULTURE ASSESSMENTS FOR THE COMPANY. AS A RESULT OF THE SETTLEMENT THE CHANGE IN OWNERSHIP WAS APPROVED BUT IT HAD TO HAVE THAT SAFETY COMPONENT. THIS JUST EXPANDS THAT OUTLINED AND TO THAT THE CPUC WILL HAVE THAT SAFETY COMPONENT A DURING THE BANKRUPTCY. THANK YOU CENTER HILLS -- ANYONE HERE IN PUBLIC. I'D SUPPORT WERE IN OPPOSITION ANYTHING MEMBERS. LEISURE THE MEMBERS TO HAVE MOTIONS BILL FOR MOVE. MOTION CLERK PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. YOU WANT TO CLOSE OF THANK YOU. PERFECT SB FIVE FIFTY DO PASSED TO APPROPRIATIONS WESSEL. I WAS SO I MORE LOT. I LIKE NO BRADFORD. BRADFORD AYE EIGHT CHIANG DIED. HERTZBERG. AYE HILL AYE HILL AYE MCGUIRE RUBIO SKINNER STERN STONE WIENER. VERY GOOD WILL MOVE ON TO ITEM NUMBER. ELEVEN SB SIX TWO FIVE THANK YOU CHAIR A LOOPHOLE IN CURRENT LAW MAKES IT LEGAL FOR PASSENGERS TO SMOKING CANNABIS IN A PARTY BUS A LIMO TAXI OR TNC. AS A RESULT SOME PARTY BUSES AND LIMO OPERATORS ARE OFFERING CANNABIS DISPENSARY TOWARDS SIMILAR TO EXISTING TOURS. FOR WINERIES OR BROUGH RICH MODELED AFTER STATUTES FOR ALCOHOL BUSES IN LIMOS. SB SIX TWENTY FIVE WILL PROHIBIT CANNABIS USE IN THESE VEHICLES AND THE SAFETY STANDARDS ARE FOLLOWED. FOR A PASSENGER ANY PARTY BUS OR LIMóN. TO SMOKE OR VAPOR CANNABIS UNLESS THE DRIVER'S COMPARTMENT IS SEALED OFF IN SEPARATELY VENTILATED. THE PURPOSE OF THE BILL IS TO ENSURE THAT THE RIVER IS NOT IMPAIRED IF CANNABIS SMOKE. IS CONSUMED IN ONE OF THESE FOR HIGHER VEHICLES THE BILL ALSO PROHIBITS ANYONE. TWENTY ONE HUNDRED TWENTY ONE FROM BEING ON BOARD IF CANNABIS SMOKERS PRESENT. SB SIX TWENTY FIVE WILL ESTABLISH SAFETY RULES TO PROTECT CONSUMERS AND ELIMINATE BAD ACTORS OF THE DISEASE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. YES GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS AMY JENKINS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CANNABIS INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION. SEE SEE I A IS PLEASED TO SUPPORT THE SPELL WHICH PROHIBITS THE INGESTION OF CANNABIS AND CANNABIS PRODUCTS IN CHARTER PARTY CARRIERS LIMOUSINES ARE TAXICABS -- WE BELIEVE THAT -- YEAH THIS IS THIS IS A OF IMPORTANT SAFETY PROTOCOLS. ACCORDING TO THE CALIFORNIA CANNABIS TOURISM ASSOCIATION IN MARCH OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN CALIFORNIA SIDE TWO HUNDRED AND IN CANNABIS RELATED TOURISM SEARCHES IN AUGUST OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN FORBES MAGAZINE REFERRED TO CANNABIS TOURISM AS QUOTE FOR THE NEXT BIG THING. IN FACT IN COLORADO CANNABIS TOURISM HAS GROWN 51% SINCE. TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN ACCORDING TO THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF REVENUE AND IS ATTRACTED SIX POINT FIVE MILLION NEW TOURISTS -- BEGINNING IN TWENTY SIXTEEN AND THAT NUMBER IS GROWING. WITH OVER TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION TOURISTS VISITING CALIFORNIA EACH YEAR WE CAN ASSUME MANY OF THESE TOURISTS ARE OR WILL BE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF CALIFORNIA'S NEWLY COMPLIANT CANNABIS MARKET PLACE. CCAP SUPPORTS THE SAFE AND RESPONSIBLE CONSUMPTION OF CANNABIS AND CANNABIS PRODUCTS AND BELIEVES PROVISIONS IN SB SIX TWENTY FIVE OR IN FURTHERANCE OF THIS POLICY. NOT ONLY DOES THIS BILL ESTABLISH APPROPRIATE SAFETY MEASURES THAT ENSURE CANNABIS IS CONSUMED RESPONSIBLY AND BY PERSONS TWENTY AND TWENTY ONE YEARS OF AGE OR OLDER. IT ESTABLISHES APPROPRIATE INDUSTRY STANDARDS FOR CANNABIS TOURISM WHILE IMPROVING THE SAFETY OF BOTH PASSENGERS AND DRIVERS. FOR THESE REASONS WE SUPPORT THE BILL -- AND ENCOURAGE YOUR AYE VOTE TODAY. THANK YOU. JUST A QUESTION OF WHEN YOU SAY THE APPROPRIATE ENTRY INDUSTRY STANDARDS WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT. THERE ARE BEST PRACTICES THAT ARE ALREADY BEING UTILIZED BY -- A LOT OF PARTY CARRIERS -- SO THIS WOULD IN FACT MANDATE THOSE TYPES OF STANDARDS BY ENSURING THAT ALL APPROPRIATE UNDER -- THEY THEY ACTUALLY HAVE BEEN INDUSTRY BEST PRACTICES THAT HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED REALLY BEGINNING IN COLORADO THERE ARE A COUPLE OF CHARTER PARTY CARRIERS THAT DID THIS -- IT WAS NOT LEGISLATIVELY MANDATED BUT TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF THEIR DRIVERS -- WE DO KNOW TOO THAT THERE IS ALSO EXISTING -- PROTECTIONS THAT WERE ESTABLISHED PURSUANT TO LEGISLATION ENACTED BY SENATOR HILL AND OTHERS -- RELATED TO ALCOHOL AND AND SAFETY IF THERE IS IN FACT AN ACCIDENT SO THIS WOULD JUST INCORPORATE THE SAME TYPES OF STANDARDS ON THAT THAT ARE ALREADY UTILIZED BY A LOT OF THE INDUSTRY BUT WOULD MANDATE THOSE TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF PASSENGERS AND THE DRIVERS WHEN CANNABIS IS. CONSUMED -- DO YOU WANT TO SPEAK IN FAVOR ON THAT DAY WE HAVE ANYBODY ELSE WAS BECAUSE FAVOR. DO WE HAVE ANYBODY WANT TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION [inaudible] ON OKAY BEFORE YOU MOVE ANY ANY SPEAKERS IN OPPOSITION. JUST GENERALLY I JUST WANT TO REMIND. EVERYONE THE THE YOU KNOW THAT THIS -- YOU MENTIONED THERE WAS A LOOPHOLE IN THE BILL AND THAT WAS YOUR BILL MAHER REMIND. LAST YEAR [inaudible] OR PUBLISHED BEFORE. EITHER AND THERE WAS A BILL THAT YOU RAN. THAT -- IMPLEMENTED PROP SIXTY FOUR AND WE TALKED ABOUT THIS -- NOT LONG AGO. AND THE ARE THE PARTICULAR CODE SECTION THAT DEALS WITH THE VEHICLES. MADE IT SO THAT YOU HAVE -- PARTY BUSES NOW -- IN A IN A SITUATION WHERE -- THE DRIVERS ARE ARE NOT ARE BEING EXPOSED TO SECONDHAND SMOKE [inaudible] AND SO. IT POSES. A IN YOUR BILL IT IS GONNA OF CREATE A TRY TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM. AND AND FRANKLY -- IT'S A VERY CALM COMPLICATED PROBLEMS SOLVED. BECAUSE YOU HAVE OF THESE VEHICLES WERE NOT DESIGNED TO BE HAVE THE SHOW FOR SEPARATE IT FROM. FROM THE PASSENGERS WHICH CREATES. A NEW SAFETY RISK FOR NOT ONLY THE PASSENGERS. AND THE DRIVER. BUT YOU HAVE A CONDITION IN WHICH PASSENGERS ARE AN ALTAR STATE OF MIND -- WHILE THEY ARE SEPARATED FROM THE DRIVER. WHO HAS -- A LIMITED ABILITY TO RESPOND TO EMERGENCIES SO -- THERE ARE FEW THINGS THAT I DO I'D LIKE TO ASK YOU TO WORK ON CENTER HILL -- AND THEY THEY AT THE DEAL WILL DEVELOP A IN -- OF OF COURSE. YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW HOW HOW WE DO THIS IS A LEGISLATURE BUT THERE ARE CERTAIN FEDERAL SANDERS HAVING TO DEAL WITH -- VEHICLE DESIGN. AND OFTENTIMES THEY'RE NOT THE WE DON'T HAVE STANDARDS AROUND -- USING OF USING A VEHICLES FOR MARIJUANA USE. AND IF PEOPLE ARE GONNA BE -- SMOKING MARIJUANA IN THE BACK OF A OF A CABIN. WHAT WHAT ARE WORTH WHAT ARE THE DANGERS ASSOCIATED THAT WITH THAT -- ARE THEY GONNA BE USING IN -- LIGHTERS A YOU KNOW UC A COMBUSTIBLE NORMALLY IN VEHICLES THAT'S NOT ALLOWED. THEY HAVE A VERY SPECIFIC LIGHTER VEHICLES. THAT DOES NOT PRODUCE A SPARK OR FIRE. AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE A VERY CROWDED BUS IN THE BACK WHERE PEOPLE MAY BE USING. UP LIGHTERS OR SOME KIND OF COMBUSTIBLE. SO YOU KNOW I HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT -- INTRODUCE SEEN COMBUSTIBLES INTO. A CABIN OF A OF A OF A VEHICLE THAT IS POWERED BY A COMBUSTIBLE FUEL. YEAH IN IN AN AREA WHERE PEOPLE MAY BE IN A CONDITION IT IN A CONDITION WHERE THERE MAY BE LESS RESPONSIVE. AN EMERGENCY. HI SO THAT'S THE FIRST ISSUE THE SECOND ISSUES HAVING TO DEAL WITH -- HOW YOU SEPARATE THE DRIVER? AND WE NEED TO COME UP WITH AN ENCLOSURE. THAT IS IS IS SAFE FOR THE DRIVER. AND ALSO -- AND I'M I'M LOOKING AT THAT -- CREATES A DRIVER COMPARTMENT WHERE THE DRIVERS COMPLETELY SEALED OFF. WHO IS THE ONLY -- NORMALLY DRIVERS ARE ARE. NOT ONLY THE DRIVERS OF THE VEHICLE BUT THEY'RE ALSO THE SUPERVISORS OF THE ACTIVITY BEHIND THE VEHICLE. IN IF I COULD POINT OUT MISTER CHAIRMAN THAT THE VEHICLE THE DOOR IS IS -- COMPLETELY TRANSPARENT AND IT IS A DOOR. SO JUST CLOSE THAT IF THERE'S AN EMERGENCY THE EASIEST WAY TO GET BACK IN. I WAS UNDER THE REAR OF THE THING I KNOW IT'S HARD TO SEE BY. I SEE THAT BUT I ALSO SEE. THAT -- IN THIS PHOTO HERE. IN THIS PHOTO HERE THE VIEW. OF OF THE THE THE THE BACKSIDE OF THE DRIVER IS COMPLETELY BLACK BOX OFFICE HIS VIEW IS SIDE WAYS. WHERE WHERE IS THE VIEW INTO THE CABIN? I DON'T KNOW I'M SURE HE LOOKS AROUND THE ACHING DID WHATEVER THAT DOOR IS THAT SEPARATES THE TWO OF AND WE CAN GET YOU MORE THERE'S A LOT OF OBSTRUCTION AND I'VE I'VE BEEN IN THE BUSES WHERE THERE'S A LOT OF OBSTRUCTION. WITHOUT HAVING IT WASN'T A MARIJUANA TOWARD BY THE WAY -- BUT THERE BEEN I'M GLAD YOU KNOW IT'S HARD THAT THEIR SOMETIMES YOU CAN'T TO SEE BUT BUT I THINK THAT YOU'RE MAKING A VERY VALID I'VE NEVER BEEN ON A BUS THAT HAS AN OBSTRUCTION. IF THE BEHIND THE DRIVER'S SEAT I'VE SEEN THAT ALL THE WAY TO THE TOP. OF I'VE SEEN THAT AND SO IT IT'S IT'S VERY BUT I I THINK YOU MAKE A GOOD A POINTS. THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S EASY ACCESS. WHITE AND YOUR YOUR STAFF BOARD. WORK CLOSELY WITH US AND I DID AND I DID WANT TO CUT YOU OFF ON THAT BECAUSE WE HAVE MORE NO NO THAT'S FINE AND IT'S OKAY IF WE HAVE AN EXCHANGE HERE BECAUSE I I HONESTLY I WE HAVE HAD LATELY DISCUSSION MY STUFF AS WELL ON THIS AS WELL. BECAUSE YOU CAN THAT YOU KNOW SHE MENTIONED YOU'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE THE HIGHWAY PATROL THERE AND AT SOME LEVEL THERE'S GONNA BE SOME LEVEL OF HIGHWAY PATROL'S. APPROVAL BUT AS LONG AS THERE IS A THERE ARE SOME STANDARDS OF THE HIGHWAY PATROL CAN ACTUALLY OF REFERENCE WHICH FROM MY UNDERSTANDING THERE AREN'T CURRENTLY. ANY STANDARDS THAT THEY CAN REFERENCE. AND IF THERE ARE AND I'D LIKE -- TO GIVE THROUGH THIS BILL THE HIGHWAY PATROL THE ABILITY TO THE LEAST ESTABLISH THOSE STANDARDS. I THINK THAT'S FAIR I THINK THIS THE HIGHWAY PATROL SHOULD DEVELOP WHATEVER STANDARDS THEY NEED TO DO DE TO DEVELOP AND OBSERVE. AND ENFORCED WHEN THEY APPROVED THE PARTICULAR DESIGN FOR ACCESS AND FOR SAFETY AND ALL OF THE OTHER THINGS AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE WE'RE WORKING WITH THEM ALSO ONE ON THE IDEA THAT. YOU KNOW THE CONSUMPTION OF THE PRODUCT IN THE VEHICLE REALLY CAN'T BE SEEN FROM OUTSIDE TO BE SHOWN YEAH. BERNIE PUBLIC PLACE AND AND THAT THEY'RE PREPARED NOTICES INSIDE THE VEHICLE LETTING PEOPLE KNOW WHAT THE LIMITATIONS ARE AND WHAT WE WITH THIS MOTION SO THERE. THIS IS I THINK THIS WOULD BE A VERY APPROPRIATE. OPPORTUNITY FOR THE HIGHWAY PATROL THE WAY AND IF THEY ARE GOING TO BE USING LIGHTERS THAT THEY BE LIGHTERS THAT ARE APPROPRIATE FOR VEHICLE USE TO EIGHT BUT I THINK THAT'S TRUE I DON'T KNOW. HOW IT WORKS TODAY WHEN YOU HAVE -- YOU KNOW PARTY BUS IN PEOPLE ARE. DRINKING ON THERE AND SOMEBODY IN THE BACK WANTS TO SMOKE THERE AREN'T LIGHTERS OF THE ELECTRONIC ONES THERE. I WOULD GUESS THAT IF IT'S A PARTY BUS THEY USE THEIR LITTLE LIGHTER AND LIGHT A CIGARETTE BUT I'M NOT SURE I'VE NEVER. NEVER SMOKED IN HAVE A FROM A FROM MY UNDERSTOOD. ARE VERY SPECIFIC IN I DON'T KNOW IF THEY'RE PROHIBITED OR HOW IT WORKS BUT WE WILL MAKE SURE THAT THAT IS. OBVIOUSLY PART OF THIS. OKAY THERE IT IS VERY IMPORTANT ALL RIGHT THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOU WORKING WITH NOT NOT REALLY. EUROPE IS VERY FAIR THANK YOU -- ANYONE ELSE [inaudible] WE HAVE. MOTION. SO MOVED. MOTION CLIP PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. SB SIX TWENTY FIVE DAY PASSED TO THE FLOOR WAS SO I WAS SO I MOORLACH BRADFORD. BRADFORD AYE KING DODD HERTZBERG. HERTZBERG AYE HILL AYE HILL AYE MCGUIRE RUBIO SKINNER. STONE WIENER [inaudible] ZERO OKAY DID YOU HAVE ANOTHER BILL SENATE ONE NINETEEN I WOULDN'T CALL I'M WITH THE OKAY THAT'S RIGHT WE HAVE ALL THANK YOU APPRECIATED THANK YOU. THIS IS CENTER BARGES HERE CITY VECTOR. ARE YOU SB SIX SO THREE ITEM. TEN WELCOME. WHEN YOU'RE READY? GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN -- IN MEMBERS OF THE BOARD WHICH TO DATE IS. IT ACTION PACKED DAY WHILE. THANKS THERE IS LIKE. SO WHAT I'D. CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE -- SB SIX ZERO THREE HAS AMENDMENTS AND WE OF AGREED TO ACCEPT THE THOSE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS -- SB SIX OH THREE DIRECTS THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION TO PERFORM ONE OF ITS CORE FUNCTIONS. RATE REGULATION. IN EFFICIENT AND TIMELY MANNER FOR TEN SMALL RURAL TELEPHONE COMPANIES RANGING IN SIZE FROM LESS THAN THREE HUNDRED CUSTOMERS TO JUST OVER SIXTEEN THOUSAND SO THIS IS VERY THIS IS THE AND THEN VERY SMALL CATEGORY. FOR DECADES THE COMMISSION HANDLED THE RAPE CASES OF THESE SMALL TELEPHONE COMPANIES. THROUGH THE ADVICE LETTER PROCESS UNDER GENERAL GENERAL ORDER NINETY SIX BE. TYPICALLY TAKING LESS THAN A YEAR FROM THE FILING OF THE FINAL COMMISSION VOTE. GENERAL ORDER NINETY SIX B. SETS FORTH THE RULES FOR THE VARIOUS USES OF THE ADVICE LETTER PROCESS. FOR EACH UTILITY SECTOR. IN TWENTY FIFTEEN THE COMMISSION ADOPTED A FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY DAY IMPLEMENTATION DEADLINE. PHONE COMPANY RATE CASES. SINCE THEN IT HAS ONLY MET ITS DEADLINE FOR THE FIRST TWO OUT OF NINE RATE CASES FILED. EACH SUBSEQUENT RATE CASES TAKE A LONGER AND LONGER CULMINATING IN THE COMMISSION RECENTLY ADOPTING RESOLUTIONS INTO RATE CASES WAVING THE EIGHTEEN MONTH STATUTORY DEADLINE FOR PROCEEDINGS. SO A LITTLE OVER A YEAR AGO SMALL TELEPHONE COMPANIES FOUND OUT THAT THE COMMISSION -- THE P. YOU SEE WAS DENYING THEM ACCESS TO THE ADVICE LETTER PROCESS. NGUYEN PINNACLES TELEPHONE THE SMALLEST OF THE SMALL REQUESTED TO USE IT FOR HIS RATE CASE. THE COMMISSION FORCED PANICLES INTO THE FORMAL PROCESS WHICH IS. MORE EXPENSIVE FOR THE COMPANY AND REQUIRES THE TIME OF AN ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE TO PRESIDE OVER HEARINGS REVIEW THE EVIDENCE IN RIGHT A PROPOSED DECISION. IT HAS BEEN ALMOST SEVENTEEN MONTHS AND THE ALE JAY STILL HAS NOT ISSUED A DRAFT DECISION. AND PICKLES RATE CASE WAS UNCONTESTED MENTIONED THAT. SB SIX OH THREE SIMPLY RESTORES THE AVAILABILITY OF THE ADVICE LETTER PROCESS FOR SMALL TELEPHONE COMPANY RATE CASES IN CODIFIES TIME LINES FOR THE COMMISSION'S PROCESSING OF THEM. TEN MONTHS FOR ADVICE LETTERS AND TWELVE MONTHS FOR APPLICATIONS. SB SIX OH THREE ALSO CODIFIES A SMALL TELEPHONE COMPANY MAY RECOVER ITS REASONABLE EXPENSES DIRECTLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO PARTICIPATING IN ITS RATE CASE. WHICH IS THE EXISTING PRACTICE ACROSS ALL UTILITIES SECTORS IN EVERY STATE OF OUR GREAT NATION INCLUDING CALIFORNIA. AS YOU KNOW THE WORD REASONABLE GIVES THE COMMISSION FULL DISCRETION TO DETERMINE THE AMOUNT OF RECOVERABLE EXPENSES. SB SIX OH THREE IN CLOSING WILL HOPEFULLY RESTORE MORE EFFICIENT COST EFFECTIVE AND TIMELY PROCESS FOR BOTH THE COMMISSION AND THE SMALL TELEPHONE COMPANIES. ALONG SIDE WITH ME -- IS YOLANDA BENSON OF CAL COM PAM LOOMIS FROM C. I. T. C.. PATRICK ROSE FALL FROM COOPER WHITE IN COOPER -- WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR COMMENT. BE ABLE TO FIELD MORE TECHNICAL QUESTIONS SO WITH THAT I ARE COMMITTEE MEMBERS I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU AND I JUST WANTED IT JUST FOR MY A BENEFIT ARE THERE. IS SPEAKERS IN OPPOSITION OF THIS BILL. DID YOU WANT TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION OKAY I JUST OKAY A WILL COME TO YOU AS SOON AS WE HEAR FROM -- THE SUPPORTERS CAN SO GOOD MORNING CHAIR. IN A POSITION OKAY. CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS -- THAT ARE HERE I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR INDEFINITELY YOUR COMMITTEE CONSULTANT WHO WORKED VERY CLOSELY WITH US AND ARE WORKING ON THE AMENDMENTS THAT ARE BEING TAKEN TODAY AS WELL. AS MENTIONED SIX OH THREE IS REALLY A PROCEDURAL CHANGE JUST TO ENSURE THAT THE SMALL COMPANIES HAVE THE ABILITY. TO USE THE INFORMAL RATE OF A PROCESS OF THE BILL IS NEEDED FOR SEVERAL REASONS NUMBR ONE THE COST IN THE BURDEN. OF THE TWO DIFFERENT TYPES OF FORMAL VERSUS INFORMAL ARE HUGE FOR BOTH THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. AND FOR OUR SMALL -- TELEPHONE COMPANIES NUMBER TWO BECAUSE OF THE DECISIONS AT THE MADE THAT HAVE BEEN MADE AT THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. AT THIS JUST MAKE SURE THAT THE INFORMAL PROCESS IS AN OPTION IT DOESN'T REMOVE THE FORMAL ACTION -- FROM BEING TAKEN IT JUST GIVES THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE INFORMAL CONSIDERED NUMBER THREE WE ARE VERY SMALL -- WE WE TAKE CARE OF THE MOST RURAL AND REMOTE MORE REMOTE PARTS OF CALIFORNIA TO ENSURE TELECOMMUNICATIONS CONNECTION. I WE SHOULD BE PARTNERING WITH THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION TRYING TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE SERVING CALIFORNIA ALL OF CALIFORNIA INCLUDING THESE MOST RURAL AREAS THERE SHOULD BE NO ADVERSARIAL ACTION. AND WHEN WE SAY RATE CASE WITH I WANT TO CLARIFY WHEN YOU HEAR RATE CASE YOU THINK -- THEY WANT TO INCREASE RATES ACTUALLY IT'S MORE OF A RATE DESIGN. MANY TIMES THESE APPLICATIONS ARE PUT IN BY OUR COMPANIES ARE NOT EVEN ASKING FOR RATE INCREASES TO THEIR SUBSCRIBERS ARE TO THEIR CUSTOMERS. THIS REALLY IS ABOUT WORKING WITH THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. ENSURING THAT THEY RECEIVE ALL THE INFORMATION THAT'S CRITICAL FOR THEM DATA. THAT IS CRITICAL FOR THEM TO MAKE DECISIONS WITH OUR COMPANIES TO BE ABLE TO GO FORWARD ON COMPLETING THESE RAPE CASES WE THINK THAT THE INFORMATION IN THE PROCESS IS TRANSPARENT IT'S ACCOUNTABLE. AND THERE IS NO LIKE I SAY THERE'S NUMEROUS DOCUMENTS AND DATA THAT ARE GIVEN TO THE P. YOU SEE. CONTINUES TO ENSURE PUBLIC PARTICIPATION PARTICIPATION BY THE CAL CALIFORNIA PUBLIC ADVOCATE'S OFFICE AS WELL. ALL THIS INFORMATION IS THE SAME INFORMATION THAT WOULD BE PROVIDED WHETHER IT WAS AN INFORMAL OR FORMAL RATE CASE THIS INFORMATION INSURERS TRANSPARENCY. AND ACCOUNTABILITY THANK YOU THANK YOU WE ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE AND BAG I THINK IT'S FAIRLY STILL GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS -- MY NAME IS PAMELA MISSED AND I REPRESENT THE TEN SMALL TELEPHONE COMPANIES THAT RECEIVE SUPPORT FROM THE HIGH COST AND A PROGRAM. THERE ARE A COALITION FOR LOBBYING PURPOSES AND THEY FULLY SUPPORT SB SIX SO. THREE BUILDING ON THE TESTIMONY OF MISS BENSON SB SIX SO THREE WOULD RESTORE THE COMMISSION'S PRACTICE TO WHAT IT'S BEEN FOR DECADES INCLUDING ALLOWING SMALL TELEPHONE COMPANIES TO RECOVER THEIR REASONABLE RATE CASE EXPENSES. THIS IS THE COMMISSION'S EXISTING PRACTICE FOR THE OTHER UTILITY SECTORS. BUT IN THE LAST ROUND OF RATE OUR OF OUR RATE CASES THE PUBLIC ADVOCATE'S OFFICE SIR CAL PA HAS BEEN ADVOCATING FOR ZERO RECOVERY. BASED ON THE MISINTERPRETATION OF A SINGLE SENTENCE IN A TWENTY FOURTEEN KEY YOU SEE DECISION ON THAT HIGH COST SPEND A PROGRAM. AT CAL PA I ARGUING THAT IF OUR CORPORATE EXPENSES ARE CERTAIN AMOUNT THEN WE SHOULD GET NOTHING TO COVER OUR RATE IS EXPENSES. THE COMMISSION CANNOT COMPLETELY IGNORE A REQUIRED EXPENSE JUST BECAUSE SOME OTHER SET OF EXPENSES ARE OF A CERTAIN AMOUNT. SB SIX OH THREE SIMPLY RESTATES EXISTING US SUPREME COURT PRECEDENT REGARDING RECOVERY OF RATE IS EXPENSE. WHICH IS THE STANDING PRACTICE IN EVERY STATE ACROSS THIS NATION. THE BILL DOES NOT LIMIT THE COMMISSION'S DISCRETION TO DETERMINE THE AMOUNT OF EXPENSE RECOVERED. HELP HE IS ALSO ARGUING THAT THIS BILL WILL SOMEHOW ALLOW RECOVERY FOR THE REGULATORY AND RATE CASE EXPENSE OF OUR AFFILIATE. EVEN AS RIDICULOUS AS THIS ARGUMENT IS. CAL PA IS FREE TO MAKE IT WHEN ARGUING OVER THE REASONABLENESS OF OUR RATE CASE EXPENSE. THE HOPE BEHIND THIS BILL IS TO SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED RATE CASE EXPENSE AND PROCEDURAL BURDEN TO THE RENEWED UTILIZATION OF THE ADVICE LETTER PROCESS FOR A RAPE CASES. IN CONCLUSION THE TRIAL LIKE ADVERSARIAL PROCESS OF FORMAL RATE CASE IS NOT NECESSARY FOR CAL PA TO DO ITS JOB OR FOR THE COMMISSION FOR THAT MATTER. CAL PA HAS INDEPENDENT AUTHORITY TO INSPECT OUR FINANCIAL RECORDS AND TO SUBMIT ITS RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE COMMISSION AND BOTH THE FORMAL AND INFORMAL PROCESS SEES. REGARDLESS OF THE PROCESS UTILIZED THE COMMISSION IS THE ULTIMATE FACT FINDER AND IT HAS ALL THE REGULATORY TOOLS TO ENSURE THE INTEGRITY OF THE HIGH COST FUND A PROGRAM -- WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT OF THIS BILL THANK YOU. OKAY. SIR DID YOU WANT TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION. YOU WONDER YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN MEMBERS. MY NAME IS MATTHEW MARCUS AND I'M WITH THE PUBLIC ADVOCATE'S OFFICE I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR ABOUT OUR ROLE THAT THE PC. WE ARE ONLY WE ARE THE ONLY PARTY. THAT THOROUGHLY EXAMINES THE SMALL TELEPHONECOMPANY RATE A JERSEY REQUESTS AT THE PC. WE DO SO TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE ARE IN THE BEST INTEREST OF CUSTOMERS THAT THESE REQUESTS ARE JUST AND REASONABLE. WITHOUT OUR ANALYSIS THE PC WOULD HAVE NO OTHER RECORD IN WHICH TO RELY ON TO MAKE WELL INFORMED. DECISIONS IN CUSTOMERS BEST INTERESTS. WE NOW INTERPRET WHAT WITH PROPERTY ARE WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THIS BILL BECAUSE IT GUARANTEES THAT RATE EXPENSES SUCH AS LEGAL ACCOUNTING. OF FILING AND SO FORTH WOULD BE DIRECTLY PASSED ON TO CUSTOMERS WITHOUT REVIEW WHY. IS IT -- BUT THIS BUILD STILL REQUIRES REVIEW ON IT. I DO NOT HAVE THE BILL FOR ME BUT IT DIRECTLY ALLOWS US TO BE A PASS TO AS LONG AS IT'S REASONABLE. AND THE VERY PURPOSE OF THE GENERAL RATE CASE PROCESSES DETERMINE WHETHER THESE OF THESE AND OTHER COSTS. ARE APPROPRIATE JUST AND REASONABLE. ON WE ALSO QUESTION THE NEED FOR THIS BILL BECAUSE THE PC CURRENTLY HAS. A HIGH COST FUND DAY PRECEDING OPEN TO LOOK AT WHAT MAKES IT WHAT OUTSTANDING POLICY ISSUES EXIST. AND WAYS TO STREAMLINE THE PRODUCT PROGRAMS ADMINISTRATION -- WE THOROUGHLY SUPPORT THE PHONE PROGRAM WE RECOGNIZE ITS IMPORTANCE. BUT BEFORE THE CPU SEES RULE MAKING IS COMPLETE WE ASK THAT YOU. PLEASE HOLD OFF ON DOING THIS BILL THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU -- OKAY. I JUST WANNA MAKE. YOU KNOW I I'VE I'VE HAD A CHANCE TO REVIEW THIS AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU -- I THINK THIS BILL VERY IMPORTANT. AND I DON'T UNDERSTAND. WHY THESE CASES TAKE SO LONG? YEARS EVEN I MEAN. AND IT DOESN'T STOP YOU SEE FROM THE NEVER ABLE TO REVIEW BUT WE NEED. WE NEED THE PC TO WORK WITH A SMALL TELEPHONE COMPANIES BECAUSE I MEAN FOR AS FOR SOME OF SOME PEOPLE OUT THERE THAT'S ALL THEY HAVE. AND AND DIG IT'S ALREADY HARD ENOUGH O KEEP THE TELEPHONE COMPANIES IN BUSINESS OUT THERE -- AND AND PUTTING A RICH -- ON A REGULATORY AN ADDITIONAL REGULATORY BURDEN ON THEM WOULD JUST MAKE IT MUCH DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO STAY IN BUSINESS AND I I GUESS MOST IMPORTANT THING IS GIVING PEOPLE. THE ACCESS TO THIS INFORMATION SO. ONE WHEN I WHEN I LEARNED ABOUT THE CHALLENGES BE FACED OUT THERE REGISTER OF THE REGULATORY VIEW I JUST THOUGHT THIS IS THIS SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO FIX. AND AND I DON'T. I YOU KNOW THE THE REVIEW HAS TO BE THERE BUT I THE LOOK LIKE MY QUESTION IS WHAT WAT IS IT TAKES SO LONG WHY TO TAKE THREE YEARS. TO RENDER A DECISION. OR EVEN A YEAR. COULD COULD WHAT WHAT IS THE CAN CAN THIS BE DONE IN A MONTH. I DON'T KNOW IS THAT SOMETHING THAT IS IS PRACTICABLE. UNDER OUR CURRENT SYSTEM SENATOR A THANK YOU I I CAN PROBABLY ADDRESS THAT A LITTLE BIT I MEAN IF YOU YOURSELF -- BETTER GOSPEL -- I'M THE REGULATORY ATTORNEY FOR A LOT OF THESE COMPANIES BEFORE THE COMMISSION AND PARTICIPATED IN A LOT OF THE RATE CASES. INCLUDING GOING BACK TO WHEN THEY USED TO BE HANDLED MORE EFFICIENTLY THROUGH THE ADVICE LETTER PROCESS. TO YOUR QUESTION I THINK. A LOT OF STATES DO THESE KINDS OF CASES IN ABOUT SIX MONTHS -- AND SO FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE YOU KNOW THAT WOULD BE A REASONABLE TIME TO TO HANDLE RUNNING SMALL TELEPHONE COMPANY WOULD TAKE SIX MONTHS. SOME STATES HAVE DIFFERENT LAYERS OF OF PROCESS USE AND SO IF IT FITS WITHIN CERTAIN PARAMETERS IT CAN BE EVEN FASTER THAN THAT -- BUT SO I THINK THERE IS A POSSIBILITY THEY COULD BE EVEN FASTER BUT TO CONDUCT THE THE FULL REVIEW OF OF THE REVENUES OF THE OF THE INVESTMENTS AND ALL THE THINGS GOING TO RAPE CASE. MOST STATES ARE DOING IT IN SOMETHING LIKE SIX MONTHS. SO THIS TIMING THAT WE'RE ASKING FOR BUILDING QUITE A BIT MORE TIME -- AND SO IS VERY CONSERVATIVE IN ITS APPROACH I WOULD SAY. IF THAT ANSWERS MENTIONED DURING THIS PROCESS THIS STILL ALLOWS YOU TO SUBMIT WHAT. WHAT -- RATE CHANGES YOU'RE SEEKING. YEAH THE THE ACTUAL CALCULATIONS AND DATA SUPPORTING A PROPOSAL IN A RAPE CASE WHETHER IT'S SUBMITTED BY BY SLOWER BY APPLICATION IT'S THE SAME. AND AND SO. THE THE COMMISSION HAS ACCESS TO THE SAME LEVEL OF DETAIL. WHETHER THEY DO IT WITH THE NAIL JAY OR WHETHER THEY HAVE THE COMMUNICATIONS DIVISION REVIEW THAT THE DOCUMENTS. THAT ARTS BURKE. I'M SORRY BUT I CAN'T HEAR A THING OVER HERE. THE TRICK OF THE EYE BETTER. AND IF I MAY I I WOULD OUT W. RIGHT TO ASK ANYWAY GO AHEAD. SORRY. IF I MAY I IT ISN'T THROUGH THE THE CAL PA IS THE ONLY ENTITY REVIEWING THESE THINGS FOR FOR YEARS AND ANY INFORMAL AND CHRYSLER PROCESS THE COMMUNICATIONS DIVISION DOES IT. AND WHAT YOU FIND IS THAT WHEN THAT OCCURS IT TURNS INTO MORE OF AN ADMINISTRATIVE NUMERICAL EXERCISE WHERE THE DATA IS REVIEWED AND REASONABLE DECISIONS ARE REACHED. WHAT HAPPENS IN AN APPLICATION PROCESS IS IT BECOMES MORE ADVERSARIAL JUST BY THE NATURE OF THE PROCESS? BUT THE OFFICE REPAIR ADVOCATES STILL INVOLVED. CERTAINLY AND THERE ARE LOTS OF ADVICE LETTER CONTEXT IN WHICH THEY CAN SUBMIT A PROTEST -- AND THEN THEY CAN BE PARTIES TO THE INFORMAL PROCESS THEY COULD SUBMIT THEIR VIEWS IN ANY WAY THEY SEE FIT -- AND THEN MEDICATIONS DIVISION WOULD CONSIDER THAT. IT WOULD ULTIMATELY RESULT IN A RESOLUTION WHICH WILL WHICH WOULD BE VOTED ON BY THE FULL COMMISSION SAME AS A DECISION COMING FROM. AN APPLICATION PROCESS WELL I JUST WANTED. TO THANK YOU FOR WORKING ON THIS -- SO SENATOR THIS IS A GREAT BILL AND AND I SUPPORT IT. WE CAN. GET THIS. OVER TO THE GOVERNOR'S DESK. AND WE ENTERTAIN A MOTION ON THIS WE HAVE A MOTION. PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. DO YOU WANNA MAKE ANY CLOSING COMMENTS. JUST A QUICK A QUICK ONE THANK YOU SURE CHAIRMAN -- JUST. TO MAKE SURE THAT THE RECORD IS CLEAN I THINK -- IT WAS EASY FOR THERE TO BE MISUNDERSTANDINGS -- THROUGH THE ADVISER PROCESS THERE IS A THOROUGH REVIEW. ALL MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE APPRECIATES THAT -- IN THE COMMISSION HAS TO OF RENDER A VOTE FOR THAT AS WELL. SO I THINK THE SAFEGUARDS ARE ABSOLUTELY HIM PLACE INEFFICIENCIES AS YOU TO APPROPRIATELY IDENTIFIED. ARE IMPERATIVE. THESE TELEPHONE COMPANIES ARE VERY VERY SMALL IN IN THESE RURAL AREAS THIS IS OUR LIFELINE. AND IT SPREAD THROUGHOUT THE SPINE OF CALIFORNIA AND ELSEWHERE -- HE MISTAKES SO WE CAN'T LET THESE -- SMALL COMPANIES -- BE COMPLETELY PUT OUT OF BUSINESS -- WITH REGULATORY -- DIFFICULT SO I THINK YOU SAID IT BEST AND I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST RIVALS THANK YOU VERY MUCH. CLICK THIS KALRA. SB SIX A THREE D. PASSES AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS HUESO HI BUT SO I'M MORE LACK BRADFORD. BRADFORD AYE KING DIED FIVE DIED AYE ERTZBERG HERTZBERG AYE HILL MCGUIRE RUBIO SKINNER STERN STONE WIENER. ZERO OKAY WILL GIVE THE ROLE OF THE FIVE YEAR MEMBERS SENATOR DODD WHETHER MONITORING. GOOD MORNING -- MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS. SB TWO OH NINE WOULD ESTABLISH THE CALIFORNIA WILDFIRE WARNING CENTER A JOINT VENTURE OF CPUC. CALLOW YES CAL FIRE. IN UTILITIES TO CONDUCT FIRE WEATHER FORECASTING THAT ALLOWS FOR ACCURATE LOCALIZED WILDFIRE RISK ASSESSMENT AND THREAT WARNING. IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THE WHILE FAR CHALLENGE OF CALIFORNIA IT IS NECESSARY. TO DEVELOP BETTER WILDFIRE -- WEATHER FORECASTING SKEWS ME WEATHER FORECASTING A WILDFIRE THREAT ASSESSMENT CAPABILITIES. SEVERAL MAJOR DIFFERENCE DEFICIENCIES WITHIN THE CURRENT STATE OF FIRE WEATHER MONITORING AND FIRE THREAT RISK ASSESSMENT CALIFORNIA. FOR EXAMPLE THERE'S A LACK OF CRITICAL WEATHER DATA. YES BUT ESPECIALLY LOCALIZE NGUYEN DATA. THERE'S A LACK OF STATE LEVEL COORDINATION THE DEVELOP OF WEATHER STATIONS BY UTILITIES. THERE IS A LACK OF AGGREGATION OF WEATHER STATION NETWORK DATA. YEAH THERE IS A LACK OF STATEWIDE FIRE THREAT POTENTIAL FORECASTING WHICH LEADS TO EFFECTIVE USE OF STATE RESOURCES. LAST YEAR SB NINE OH ONE REQUIRED THE CPU SEEING CAL FIRE TO ENTER INTO AN ANIMAL YOU TO COOPERATIVELY DEVELOP CONSISTENT APPROACHES AND SHARE DATA RELATED TO FIRE PREVENTION. SAFETY VEGETATION MANAGEMENT IN ENERGY DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM. IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THE WILDFIRE PREDICTION DEFICIENCIES I JUST MENTIONED SB TWO OR NINE TAKES THAT COLLABORATION REQUIRED IN SB NINE A ONE ONE STEP FURTHER. IT ALSO BRINGS CAL FIRE IN THE UTILITIES DIRECTLY INTO THE MIX. UNDER SB TWO OH NINE THE C. W. W. C. WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ONGOING MONITORING OF FIRE WHETHER IT'S RIGHT CONDITIONS. AS WELL AS ITS ONGOING IMPROVEMENT OF FIRE WEATHER FORECASTING MODELS. THE C. W. W. C. WILL RECEIVE AND VERIFY INFORMATION PERTAINING TO FIRE THREAT CONDITIONS UTILITY PROACTIVE DINNER JASON. THE ENERGY IS ATION OF POWER LINES. AND ACTIVE FIERY VETS. THE C. W. W. C. WILL OVERSEE AND COORDINATE THE DEVELOPMENT AND DEPLOYMENT OF A STATEWIDE NETWORK OF AUTOMATED WEATHER AND ENVIRONMENTAL STATIONS. IN A STATEWIDE FIRE WEATHER FORECASTS DURING THAT CASTING MONITORING AT THE END -- THREAT ASSESSMENT SYSTEM. THE C. W. W. C. WILL WORK WITH INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES TO A DOT C. W. D.. W. C. APPROVE WHETHER MONITORING EQUIPMENT IN THE C. W. W. C. WILL OVERSEE THE DEVELOPMENT OF A VALIDATED FIRE THREAT POTENTIAL INDEX IN ENSURE THAT EVERY GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION. YOUR AREA IN CALIFORNIA IS COVERED BY SUCH AN INDEX. I'M AWARE THAT SO SOME VERY GOOD WORK IS ALREADY BEING DONE IN THE AREA FIRE THREAT -- WEATHER PREDICTION INCLUDING THE WORK AND ES DE GENIE. IN OUR OWN CAL FIRE MY INTENTION AN AUTHORING SB TWO OH NINE IS TO BRING DISPARATE FIRE THREAT PREDICTION. ACTIVITIES TOGETHER -- TO COORDINATE AND STANDARDIZE THE RESPONSE PROTOCOLS TO THOSE THREATS BY OUR ELECTRICAL UTILITIES AND LOWERED THE POTENTIAL FOR FUTURE CATASTROPHICALLY. CATASTROPHIC EVENTS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOU RIGHT. VERY WELL. TWENTY CHAIR MEMBERS GREG COOK REPRESENT A CALIFORNIA POWER AGENCY WERE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THE INTENT OF THIS LEGISLATION AND URGES ADOPTION THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT PLEASE COME FORWARD. IF YOU'VE GOT THE THIRD MEMBERS OUT THERE ABOUT THIS WEEK CALIFORNIA CITIES IN SUPPORT. JOHN KENNEDY ON BEHALF OF THE RURAL COUNTIES IN STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU. I NEED ANOTHER GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS FOR SANDY OF GAS AND ELECTRIC APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S WORK ON THIS ISSUE WE ARE IN SUPPORT WE JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT -- IF THE SENDER IS VERIFYING INFORMATION RELATED. TO CONDITIONS I'M DINNER TODAY'S STANDARDIZATION EVENTS AND OF FIRE EVENTS THAT IT DOESN'T MEAN THEY'RE VERIFYING PRIOR TO OUR ABILITY TO THIRTY TWO DE ENERGIZED BY THEN THAT HAVE TO SUPPORT AND REALLY BUT SHE DOES WORK ON IT THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS GIVING A FLEMING'S ON BEHALF OF PACIFIC GAS AND ELECTRIC COMPANY WE ALSO ARE IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL ME THINK THE AUTHOR FOR HIS LEADERSHIP THANK YOU. THANK YOU CHARMERS RHYME PARINI WAS SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON APPRECIATE THE WORK OF THE AUTHOR IS DONE -- TO ADDRESS SOME OF OUR CONCERNS WE SUPPORT THE BILL MOVING FORDING CONTINUE -- OUR COMMITMENT TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR THANK YOU [inaudible] ANY OPPOSITION [inaudible] OKAY -- WE HAVE A A RECOMMENDATION HERE -- TO PASS. ON THIS BILL -- TO MOVE WE HAVE A MOTION. CLICK PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. DID YOU WANNA MAKE ANY CLOSING COMMENTS LIKE WE ASK FOR AB THANK YOU. SB TWO NINE TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS WAS SO. I WAS SO I MOORLACH BRADFORD. BRADFORD I CHIANG. I THOUGHT I HERTZBERG. AYE HILL MCGUIRE RUBIO SKINNER STERN STONE WIENER [inaudible] HERTZBERG. WE CAN CONNECT AND WE ARE COMMITTED TO THE CHARGES TO CALL THE MOTHER'S PERCENT AS CHAIR [inaudible] EIGHT FIVE TWENTY RIGHT WHICH OF THE BILL. A MAN YOU NEVER KNOW. THANK YOU SIR. BY THIS MEASURE ESTABLISHES A BASIC SAFETY NET MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF FOR ELECTRICITY CUSTOMERS LIKE DESIGNATED A PROVIDER OF LAST RESORT. SOMETHING THAT WE UNTIL ALL THIS STUFF WE STARTED WAS THE PEACE AND JIM ROLLED THE YEARS AGO NEVER HAD TO THINK ABOUT. BECAUSE THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIESWERE THE PROVIDERS OF LAST RESORT -- THESE PROVIDER OF LAST RESORT AS SET FORTH IN THIS VISUAL CONTENT WILL ENSURE CONTINUOUS ELECTORAL SERVICES. IN CASE A RETAIL ELECTRICITY PROVIDER BELIEVES THE MARKET FOR ANY REASON WHATSOEVER WHETHER IT'S A BANKRUPTCY DECIDES TO LEAVE WHATEVER THE SITUATION MAY BE. AND IS THIS COMMITTEE IS WELL AWARE OF THE LAST YEARS AND I HAVE CERTAINLY BEEN ON IT. A RETAIL CHOICES GROWN DRAMATICALLY HOWEVER NOT ALL LOW SERVING AS THESE WHO ARE REGULATED LEAVING THOSE CUSTOMERS POTENTIALLY. WITHOUT KEY CUSTOMER AND PRICE PROTECTIONS CURRENTLY THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES I SAY ACT AS THE PROVIDERS OF LAST RESORT. AND IN TWO THOUSAND ONE WHEN WE HAD AN INCIDENT STARTING IN SAN DIEGO -- ONLY 15% OF LOS SERVICE WITH LOW RESERVE BY SOMEONE OTHER THAN AN INVESTOR OWNED UTILITY TODAY'S YOU KNOW MISTER CHAIRMAN QUITE WELL. THAT NUMBER 44% AND WE CAN'T LEAVE THOSE CUSTOMERS WITHOUT BASIC PROTECTION LAST YEAR. FOLLOWING A SERIES OF A PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION WORKSHOPS THERE WAS A CONSENSUS REFLECTED IN THE P. UC'S QUOTE GREEN BOOK KNOWN AS THE GAP ANALYSIS. A IT DEFINING WHAT. THAT POLAR IS NECESSARY ADDITIONALLY AS WE YOU ALSO KNOW THE GOVERNOR STRIKE TEAM. IDENTIFIED POLAR'S OBLIGATIONS AS A SIGNIFICANT CONCERN IN THE WILD FOR ENERGY FUTURES REPORT SPECIFICALLY I'M QUOTING. THE REPORT SAYS IF I'LL USE BECOME PRIMARILY POLES AND WIRES BUSINESSES IT RAISES THE QUESTION AS TO WHETHER THE I AO UCHE SHOULD CONTINUE TO PROVIDE POLAR SERVICE OR WHETHER ANOTHER ENTITY SHOULD ASSUME THIS RESPONSIBILITY. THIS BILL ADDRESSES THAT ISSUE HAD HAD ON FIVE TWENTY THE INITIALLY DESIGNATES THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITY IS THE POLAR FURTHER DISTRIBUTION SERVICE AREAS INCLUDED. A INCLUDING FOR CUSTOMERS OF CCA'S. AND THE S. P. IS CONSISTENT WITH CURRENT PRACTICE HOWEVER WHAT IT DOES IS IT PROVIDES SOME FLEXIBILITY THAT ALLOWS AND I USED TO TRANSFER THE POLAR RESPONSIBILITY TO ANOTHER PROVIDER. THAT WANTS TO SPEAK TO SERVE THAT FUNCTION ALLOWS THOSE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES AND WANT TO GET OUT VERSUS THOSE DON'T [inaudible] BUT STE. FOR CUSTOMERS. AND SO IT'S A STRAIGHTFORWARD MEASURE IT I THINK IT'S SUPPORT OF PORTENT STEP IN THIS LARGER DYNAMIC AS WE LOOK TO RESOURCE ADEQUACY -- PROVIDERS OF LAST RESORT TOGETHER WITH SENT TO PROCUREMENT WHICH IS REALLY THE THREE STOOLS LEGS OF THE STOOL THIS WERE MOVING AND FIGURE OUT HOW TO DEAL IN THIS NEW DYNAMIC MARKET. A NINETY TALK. YOU SEE PRESIDENT'S PICKERS CHIEF OF STAFF WAS. AHEAD OF THE PC WORKSHOP AND ALICE'S FOR THE POLISH YOU SHE'S THE MOST KNOWLEDGEABLE PERSON. THE ADMINISTRATION'S NOT TAKEN A POSITION SHE SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE OF THE PROCESS AND PRESIDENT PICKER. THANK YOU SENATOR. MORNING SENATORS MY NAME IS BETTY TUCKER AND I AM TWO PERCENTAGE IN EXTERNAL AFFAIRS OR PRESIDENT MICHAEL PICKER OF THE TPC. AS SENATOR HERTZBERG NOTED -- I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF PRESIDENT PICKER AND NOT SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE PC BECAUSE WE HAVE NOT TAKEN A FORMAL POSITION ON SB. FIVE TWENTY AS YOU ALL ARE AWARE MORE SO THAN EVER CALIFORNIA ELECTRICITY USERS CAN GET THEIR POWER FROM SOURCES OTHER THAN THE TRADITIONAL I OWE YOU WHICH IS ROOFTOP SOLAR DIRECT ACCESS AND COMMUNITY TWENTY AGGREGATORS. THIS MEANS CALIFORNIA CUSTOMERS HAVE MORE. TO FOR CITING THE GREATEST WHICH IS LEADING TO LOW DEPARTING FROM THE I'LL USE AT A RAPID PACE. BY THE END OF THE YEAR OUR ESTIMATES INDICATE THAT ALMOST WILL HAVE DEPARTED. WITH THE GROWTH AND LOW SERVING AND ANY OPTIONS IN THE STATE. AS OF SEPTEMBER THERE ARE NOW THIRTY SEVEN ALEX HE'S UNDER PC CUSTOMERS INCLUDING. THREE I'LL USE NINETEEN CCA'S AND FOURTEEN YES PLEASE. DESIGNATED ENTITIES NEED TO BE READY TO PROVIDE ELECTRICITY IF THE MARKET DOES NOT MEET CUSTOMER DEMAND DUE TO A SUDDEN EXIT FOR FAILURE OF A LOT OF TRIMMING AND IT. RIGHT NOW THE I'LL USE ARE ESSENTIALLY AND DEFAULT PROVIDER OF LAST RESORT. UNDER P. YOU CODE SECTION FOUR FIFTY ONE BUT THERE IS NO DEFINED PROVIDER OF LAST RESORT IN STATUTE. THE I'LL USE HAVE ALWAYS SERVED IN THIS ROLE BY DEFAULT HAVING AN OBLIGATION TO SERVE CUSTOMERS. WE ARE SEEING A TRANSITION AND LOAD SERVING ENTITIES IN THE STATE AND NEED TO PLAN FOR CUSTOMERS TO HAVE A PROVIDER OF LAST RESORT TO ENSURE ON INTERRUPTED SERVICE. THROUGH THE CUSTOMER CHOICE PROJECT THE COMMISSION RAISE A FUNDAMENTAL QUESTIONS WE NEEDED TO ANSWER TO ADDRESS FRAGMENTED ELECTRICITY PROCUREMENT. AND WE STOP AND SO HAVE RELIABLE AND AFFORDABLE ACTRESS CITY THAT MEETS THE STATE'S AGGRESSIVE GHG REDUCTION TARGETS. THE MOST IMPORTANT PRIORITY COMING OUT OF THE GAP ANALYSIS WAS THE CREATION OF A PROVIDER OF LAST RESORT THAT WILL ENSURE ON INTERRUPTED SERVICE AND AFFORDABLE PRICES. IN THE EVENT ALLEGE SERVING AND IF HE FAILS. WE ARE AGNOSTIC ON WHO SERVED AS THE POLAR AND LONG AS THE LOW TRIMMING AND EDDIE MEETS CRITERIA CRITICAL THRESHOLD REQUIREMENT. SOME OF THESE HAVE BEEN RAISED IN SB FIVE TWENTY ALL RUN THROUGH A FEW. INCLUDING ADMINISTRATIVE CAPACITY AND FINANCIAL STANDING TWO OF YOUR CUSTOMERS IN THE EVENT OF AN INCUMBENT POLICIES AND ABILITY. TO SERVE CUSTOMERS. I DETERMINATION OF FINANCIAL CAPACITY OR THE HEALTH OF THE COLOR COULD BE DETERMINED USING SOME TYPE OF FINANCIAL STRESS TEST. THAT ASSESSES COLLATERAL ON HAND AMONG OTHER FACTORS. ALSO THE POLAR SHOULD HAVE A TRACK RECORD OF PREVIOUSLY SERVING CUSTOMERS AND PREPARING CARBON FREE RESOURCES. SHOULD HAVE A KNOWLEDGE OF RETAIL. ELECTRICITY MARKETS SHOULD BE ABLE TO COVER CERTAIN BINDING REQUIREMENTS TO COVER ADMINISTRATIVE IN PROCUREMENT COST ASSOCIATED WITH TRANSITIONING CUSTOMERS. AMONG OTHER FACTORS TO BE DETERMINED. FINALLY THE PC WOULD NOT. OBVIOUSLY SERVICE A POLAR BUT WHAT HAVE OVERSIGHT OVER LOVE DRIVING ENTITIES SERVING IN THIS CAPACITY AND WOULD MONITOR THE MARKET VERY VERY CLOSELY. THE PC AT REGULAR INTERVALS OF SUCH AS ANNUALLY WHAT IF THAT'S REGISTERED POLAR TO ENSURE THEY COULD MEET THE THRESHOLD REQUIREMENTS. AND WOULD CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE RELIABILITY OF THESE COLORS PARTICULARLY IF THEY'RE A MAJOR SHIFT IN THE CALIFORNIA RETAIL MARKET. SUCH AS WE ARE SEEING TODAY WITH THE INCREASE IN THE SEGREGATION OF ELECTRICITY CARMEN. THANK YOU. MR MEMBERS CAN CAL'S ON BEHALF OF SAN DIEGO GAS ELECTRIC WE ARE IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL THERE'S ONE AMENDMENT WE WOULD LIKE TO SEEK AND IT'S TO INSURE THATTHE COMMISSION ACTUALLY CREATES AND DESIGNATES RATHER THAN HAVING THE AUTHORITY TO DESIGNATE AN ENTITY. AS YOU'RE WELL AWARE AND YOUR COMMITTEE IS HOLD HELD A COUPLE OF INFORMATIONAL HEARINGS ON THE SUBJECT -- IN THE BEGINNING OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO IS MOVING TOWARDS THE CCA THAT'S 40% OF OUR LOAD. WE THINK IT'S A REAL POSSIBILITY THAT WE HAVE 15% OF OUR LOAD STILL SERVED BY US IN THE NEXT HIM FULLY YEARS. MA'AM CUSTOMER'S ACCOUNT FOR ALMOST 13%. WITHIN THE TIME IS RIGHT FOR THIS DEBATE AND APPRECIATE THE AUTHORS A REFERENCE TO THE GOVERNOR'S WHILE FAT WIRE WILDFIRE REPORT. FOR HE MENTIONED THIS AS WELL AS FOR YOUR SUPPORT. ANYONE IN OPPOSITION. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS COMMITTEE EIGHT MATT FREEMAN ON BEHALF OF TURN WE'RE NOT OPPOSING THE BILL WE HAVE A CONCERN LETTER ON WE APPRECIATE THE EFFORTS TO SENATOR HERTZBERG IS MAKING TO TEE UP THIS CONVERSATION. I THINK WE JUST WANT TO POINT OUT WHAT WE THINK IS MISSING FROM THE BILL AS IT CURRENTLY STANDS AND WE UNDERSTAND THAT WOULD BE A TOPIC FOR CONVERSATION GOING FORWARD -- A WE HAVE A FEW ITEMS FIRST OF ALL THE BILL APPEARS TO REQUIRE THAT THE PROVIDER OF LAST RESORT BE AN EXISTING LOAD SERVING ENTITY -- AND WE WOULD LIKE TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO ASSIGN THIS FUNCTION TO A STATE AGENCY OR AN INDEPENDENT NONPROFIT THAT MIGHT NOT HAVE PREVIOUSLY SERVED RETAIL CUSTOMERS. JUST AN EXAMPLE OF A PROVISION OF THE BILL THAT MIGHT IN IT. IN A VERDANT LEE RESTRICT -- OPPORTUNITIES TO LOOK AT ALTERNATIVE ARRANGEMENTS ALSO WE'D LIKE TO SEE A GREATER REFERENCES TO THE ABILITY OF THE P. YOU SEE TO ENGAGE IN ONGOING OVERSIGHT OF PERFORMED BY A PROVIDER OF LAST RESORT TO SERVE ITS CUSTOMERS WERE NOT SEEN. ENOUGH THERE -- TO MAKE US COMFORTABLE. IT ALSO DOESN'T ESTABLISH THE PC CAN REGULATE RATES CHARGED BY THE PROVIDER OF LAST RESORT TO RETAIL CUSTOMERS IN TERMS OF SERVICE INCLUDING CONSUMER PROTECTIONS -- THERE'S ALSO NO PROVISION EXPLICITLY PERMITTING RETAIL CUSTOMERS TO OPT OUT OF SERVICE BY ANOTHER PROVIDER TO TAKE SERVICE FROM THE PROVIDER OF LAST RESORT IF A CUSTOMER WERE TO SO CHOOSE. AND FINALLY THE BILL DOESN'T REALLY EXPLAIN THE RANGE OF FUNCTIONS THAT WOULD BE PERFORMED BY A PROVIDER OF LAST RESORT THERE'S A REFERENCE TO ELECTRICAL SERVICE. BUT WE'RE NOT SURE HOW MANY DIFFERENT FUNCTIONS THAT MIGHT ENCOMPASS -- AND IT MIGHT ARTIFICIALLY CONSTRAIN THE PC FROM CONSIDERING THE TRANSFER OF OTHER RETAIL FACING FUNCTIONS TO THIS ENTITY. SO WE'RE JUST IDENTIFYING THESE AS GAPS IN THE ARCHITECTURE WE UNDERSTAND THE BILL IS NOT FULLY FORMED AS PRESENTED TODAY AND THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO TALK ABOUT IT. I'M AND ALTHOUGH WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING ON THAT WE'RE STILL NOT PERSUADED. THAT THE CURRENT CONDITIONS ARE APPROPRIATE FOR AUTHORIZING AN ALTERNATIVE PROVIDER OF LAST RESORT SO WE'D LIKE TO KEEP. THE THRESHOLD QUESTION OPEN OF WHETHER WE ACTUALLY NEED TO MOVE THIS FUNCTION AWAY FROM THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES. AS THE CONVERSATION CONTINUES. THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE IN THE PUBLIC. MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ANYTHING. THANK YOU ONE RESPOND ANY THOSE COMMENTS OR THAT A LOT OF CLOSING MY COMMENTS YEAH I DID THAT I THOUGHT MOST AND WE'RE REALLY -- THOUGHTFUL AND AND AND THE COMMENTS THE ONLY THING IS THE QUESTION OF IS IT TIMELY. I THINK THIS QUESTIONS ABOUT TIME IN THIS RESPECT TO CENTER PROCUREMENT. BUT MY SENSE IS THERE'S NOT TIME WHEN THIS WITH THIS BEST. FIGHTERS OF LAST RESORT THE THE THE WORLD IS CHANGING IN A DRAMATIC PACE AS SUCH SAN DIEGO WANTS TO GET OUT OF THE BUSINESS. EDISON DOESN'T TO DIFFERENT WE IS TO TAKE A WHILE THESE THINGS DON'T HAPPEN OVERNIGHT. AND I DO IS GOING OUT WRECKED DISAGREE WITH WAS THE THAT THE URGENCY TO MOVE ON THE POLAR ISSUE. ALTHOUGH I THINK ALL THE OTHER COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE WITH RESPECT TO TURN WROTE ABOUT FLINT HAVE TO INCLUDE. THAT'S RIGHT VERY WELL. OKAY CAN WE HAVE EMOTIONAL. WILL MOTION. PLEASE CALL THE ROLL.

MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS -- TODAY TO PRESENT A BILL THAT HOPEFULLY WILL. REDUCE THE RISK AN IMPACT BOTH OF WILDFIRES BUT ALSO THE PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFFS THAT WE NEED TO BE UTILIZING TO PREVENT WILDFIRES. WE NEED TO REDUCE THE NEGATIVE IMPACT THOSE HAVE ON VULNERABLE INFRASTRUCTURE AND VULNERABLE. I WANT TO START BY. THE COMMITTEE -- FOR THEIR WORK AND THE AMENDMENTS -- I WANT TO FLESH OUT. V.. I APPRECIATE THE THE POINTS ABOUT -- PREVENTING ANY COST SHIFTING [inaudible] SORRY [inaudible] ALL RIGHT [inaudible] SO. I APPRECIATE THE POINTS ABOUT RUNNING COST SHIFTING GOOD WITH THAT. SHE THE POINTS ABOUT EVEN IF THE PC'S ABILITY TO SAY. YES OR NO. I THINK THAT'S FINE. SO WILL ACCEPT THOSE I KNOW THERE'S GONNA BE SOME DISCUSSION ABOUT THAT AND AND I WANT TO GIVE. ONE OF OUR SUPPORTERS SOME SOME -- SOME ROOM TO DISCUSS THAT -- BUT THE PART THAT'S REALLY NOT FLESHED OUT YET IN THE LEGISLATION AND IN THE ANALYSIS IS. ON THE BEHIND THE METER SIDE SO WE ALSO DON'T WANT. WE DON'T WANT. THOSE IN THE WILL BE WHO ARE GETTING SOME MICRO GREAT FOR THEIR HOSPITAL TO GET NECESSARILY THE SAME RATE OR OR THE SAME COSTS THAT PROJECT THAT SOMEBODY'S NOT BENEFITING SO. THE BENEFICIARY HAS TO PAY HERE WE DO NOT WANT TO SEE COST SHIFTS SO I JUST WANT TO FIGURE OUT SOME MECHANICS TO FIGURE OUT THE BEHIND THE METER SIDE OF THE NON CIRCUIT SIDE. AS WE GO FORWARD BUT FOR THE IN FRONT OF THE METER AT THE CRITICAL CIRCUIT SIDE I I I DO THINK THAT THERE HAS TO BE SOME CONNECTION TO THE BENEFITS TO THE GRID SO. SO I'M THERE ON THAT I JUST SORT OF WANT TO GIVE YOU HAVE. TO WORK WITH YOU GUYS GOING FORWARD TO TO TO SEARCH OUT THE WITH YOUR HOSPITAL A NURSING FACILITY A FIRE STATION THOSE MICROGRAMS ARE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT THAN WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ON THE CRITICAL CIRCUIT SIDE SO ONE FLESH THAT AS WE GO FORWARD. WITH THE IMMENSE TODAY. AND WITH THAT. HAVE AN ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS OR DIGGING FURTHER BUT RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR ABOUT. YEAH YEAH CAN'T CAL'S WITH SAN DIEGO GAS ELECTRIC ALSO WANT TO THANK THE STAFF FOR THE THOROUGH ANALYSIS A DOES A REALLY GOOD JOB OF POINTING OUT. THE BENEFITS OF HAVING A MIKE REGRET ON RESILIENCY. AND ADDITIONAL RELIABILITY AS YOU ALL ARE AWARE AND SPECIALLY YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I GUESS OTHER MEMBERS OF SEVERAL OF YOU HAVE BEEN DOWN TO OUR WEATHER CENTER. WE HAVE A STATE OF THE ART WEATHER CENTER THAT WEATHER CENTER HELPS US MAKE ALL KINDS OF DECISIONS OPERATIONAL ENGINEERING DECISIONS OTHER THINGS THAT -- COME INTO PLAY WITH OUR CLIMATE CHANGES THAT ARE TAKING PLACE. WE HAVE IDENTIFIED SEVERAL AREAS WITHIN OUR SERVICE TERRITORY THAT COULD BENEFIT NOT FROM MAKES SPECIFIC CUSTOMER -- BASIS BUT A BROADER OF PUBLIC BENEFIT. FOR SHERIFF'S SUBSTATIONS FIRE STATIONS -- CRITICAL WATER FACILITIES AND OTHERS WHERE WE THINK THIS WOULD BE OF BENEFIT. COUPLE YEARS AGO ASSEMBLYMEMBER MIKE AUTO APPROVED A PAST ABILITY TWENTY EIGHT SIXTY EIGHT THAT KIND OF WAS AHEAD OF ITS TIME IN IDENTIFYING THE NEED FOR DISTRIBUTED ENERGY RESOURCES. WE TOOK THAT OPPORTUNITY TO PROPOSE SEVEN PROJECTS ON WILD FIRE MITIGATION. THAT DECISION IS PENDING FOR THE PC AND ACTUALLY TAKES A THE REJECTS WERE HOPING TO GET THAT TURNED AROUND. BUT WE THINK CUSTOMER OWNED MICRO GRIDS ARE AN ESSENTIAL PART OF WHAT WE'RE DOING WHEN WE IMPLEMENTED OUR DE ENERGIZING PROGRAMS. WE DID SOME ENGINEERING WORK TO TRY TO NARROW THE SCOPE OF WHO WOULD BE IMPACTED THIS WOULD BE ANOTHER MITIGATION TOOL TO LESSEN THE IMPACTS ON CUSTOMERS. WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR -- WE THINK THIS A VERY IMPORTANT STEP FORWARD WE ALSO POINTED OUT -- THIS PROGRAM IN OUR WILD FIRE MITIGATION PLAN THAT WAS FILED COUPLE MONTHS AGO MORE OPEN THE PC WILL PROVE THAT. IN A TIMELY MATTER AND WE CAN GO FORWARD WITH -- ADDITIONAL MISSED MITIGATION MEASURES. SPEAKERS IN SUPPORT. COME UP TO THE MIKE. LARA COME ON BEHALF OF SIERRA CLUB CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. SPEAKERS IN OPPOSITION. JAMIE MEDER FOR KELSEY CA NOT IN OPPOSITION -- APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S COMMITMENT TO CONTINUE -- AUTHORS OFFICE COMMITMENT TO KEEP WORKING WITH US -- JUST TO ENSURE THERE'S NO UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES FROM KEEPING AYE CCA'S FROM DEPLOYING MICROGRAMS IN THIS IMPORTANT TECHNOLOGY AND REAPING THE BENEFITS SO. THANKS CONTINUE. TO MOVE WHERE THE DISCUSSION. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M NOT FRIEDMAN ON BEHALF OF TURN. INTERMENT RENEWABLE GENERATION AND WE ARE INTERESTED IN SEEING THE ROLE FOR MICROGRAPHS BUT WE'RE CONCERNED THIS BILL -- INAPPROPRIATELY PRIORITIZES POTENTIALLY EXPENSIVE MIKE REGRET INVESTMENTS WITHOUT INSURING THEIR THE MOST EFFECTIVE. AND LEAST COST OPTION FOR PROMOTING GRADE RELIABILITY AND RESILIENCY -- THE BILL DOES NOT ACCOUNT FOR THE FACT THAT UTILITIES HAVE INVESTED BILLIONS OF DOLLARS DURING THE LAST DECADE. IN MODERN GREAT TECHNOLOGIES INCLUDING SENSOR SWITCHES AND COMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT -- PRECISELY TO PROMOTE RESILIENCY DURING PLANNED AND UNPLANNED OUTAGES -- DOES SOLUTION OF A MICROGRAM MAY OR MAY NOT BE THE MOST APPROPRIATE RESPONSE TO CONCERNS ABOUT RESILIENCY -- THEY ARE POTENTIALLY VERY EXPENSIVE AND THAT'S WHERE WE GET TO OUR CONCERNS ABOUT THE RATE PAYER INTEREST STANDARD THAT IS ARTICULATED IN THE BILL -- THERE'S A REFERENCE SECTION SEVEN FORTY POINT EIGHT AS THE BASIS FOR DETERMINING WHETHER AN INVESTMENT IS IN THE RATEPAYERS INTEREST -- AND IT IS -- IS A PARTICULAR PROVISION THAT IS NARROW IT'S USED IN THE CONTEXT OF PROMOTING. LOW EMISSIONS TRANSPORTATION AND TRANSPORTATION ELECTRIFICATION. I INVESTMENTS IN OUR VIEW THE STANDARD DOESN'T REALLY WORK FOR THIS PURPOSE -- BECAUSE IT DOESN'T CONSIDER THE COSTS AND BENEFITS TO THE BROAD GROUP OF RATE PAYERS WHO HAVE TO FOOT THE BILL FOR THIS -- WE THINK THAT MICHAEL GREAT INVESTMENTS THAT ARE FUNDED BY THE UTILITIES SHOULD BE EVALUATED USING TRADITIONAL ANALYSES FOR THE BENEFITS AND COSTS OF THE INVESTMENT. ON END CONSIDERING THE COSTS OF ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES TO SOLVING THE SAME PROBLEM. ON IT DOESN'T APPEAR THAT THE BILL CURRENTLY CONSIDERS THE PC ALLOWS THE PC TO COMPARE THE BENEFITS AND COSTS OF THESE ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES -- IN ADDITION THERE IS A COST RECOVERY PROVISION THAT DIRECTS THE RECOVERY OF COSTS IN PROPORTION TO THE BENEFITS RECEIVED BY VARIOUS GROUPS OF REPAIRS WERE NOT SURE WHAT THIS MEANS. THE COSTS. MAY OR MAY NOT END UP GETTING RECOVERED FROM NON PARTICIPANT CUSTOMERS VERSUS PARTICIPANTS WE THINK THAT THERE'S A CLARIFICATION HERE. THAT ANY COST SHOULD BE RECOVERED FROM ALL CUSTOMERS ON A NON BY PASSABLE BASIS BECAUSE THE CURRENT LANGUAGE WILL GUARANTEE A LOT OF LITIGATION OVER WHAT IT MAY OR MAY NOT MEAN. ON AND THEN FINALLY WE WOULD JUST. THE BILL REQUIRES THAT ANY MICROGRAM VESTMENTS BY A UTILITY SHALL EARN A REASONABLE RATE OF RETURN. CONSISTENT WITH OTHER TRADITIONAL CAPITAL INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS THIS IS A MISSTATEMENT OF EXISTING ALONG. EXISTING LAW SETS RATES SO THAT UTILITIES HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO RECOVER THEIR RATE OF RETURN THEY ARE NOT GUARANTEED THE RATE OF RETURN THAT IS. PART OF THE RISK FACTOR THAT GOES INTO SETTING THIS COST CAPITAL -- AND I WOULD JUST CAUTION THE COMMITTEE GIVEN THE RECENT ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE THREE MAJOR UTILITIES THAT THEY INTEND TO SEEK HUGE INCREASES IN THEIR RATES OF RETURN ON SHAREHOLDER EQUITY. IT'S REALLY NOT A PRO TO ESTABLISH NEW RIGHTS FOR RECOVERY OF SHAREHOLDER COST INSURER EQUITY. RETURNS -- AS PART OF STATE LEGISLATION SO WE HAVE BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR ON THIS WE ARE TRYING TO BE CONSTRUCTIVE IN OUR FEEDBACK. THANKS. I THINK THAT WAS VERY CONSTRUCTIVE. OKAY ANYONE ELSE US STEVE YOU ARE -- I WOULD LIKE TO STRESS WE NEED TO STOP USING THESE TRYST TRADITIONAL WAYS OF EVALUATING THE AT THE GRID -- THESE. I'M A MANUFACTURING ENGINEER WORKED IN THE FORTY YEARS. I AT I I AM TOTALLY AMAZED THIS IS CALIFORNIA AND THERE'S A COLLECTION A SPREADSHEET. THAT ARE USED TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT THAT'S WHERE THE TOP CARD. OF CAME INTO SIGHT [inaudible] DOT CHART. WE KNOW THE SUN RISES EVERY DAY WE DON'T WE NEED TO GO TO DISCRETE EVENT SCHEDULING THE KIND OF THING THAT TOYOTA USES TO BUILD CARS JUST IN TIME. I ANALOG SCHEDULING. IS BATCHING Q.. SO YOU YOU SAY ALL I GET SO MUCH. AND YOU ACT AS IF YOU HAVE STORAGE I'VE EVEN HAD PEOPLE -- IT HURT PEOPLE'S TALK ABOUT THINGS IN TERMS OF 30% CAPACITY. BUT A IF YOU LOOK AT WIND I TAKEN ALL CAL ISEL STUFF YOU LOOK AT HOW UNRELIABLE WIND IS. AND YOU LOOK AT ALL THESE OTHER -- SITUATIONS USE YOU LOOK AT THIS DATA. YOU ABSOLUTELY NEED TO CHANGE. SENATOR BRADFORD'S STASHED STORAGE THING. I PUBLIC IN THIS AND I'M SAYING THIS IS A WASTE OF TIME TO HAVE ALL THESE PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT THIS. THESE ANSWERS ARE TOLD THEY ARE THERE WE ENDED THE MECHANISMS ARE THEY ARE THE COMMISSION DOESN'T USE THEM I'VE DOCKET IT. BASIC SYSTEMS NOBODY EVEN CUT ASK ME WHAT WHAT'S THIS DO OR HOW'S THIS WORK -- I WOULD LIKE TO SEE TO IT. TO TALK WITH -- WITH ANYBODY ON THIS WE EXCHANGE THIS. IT'S JUST CLIMATE CHANGE WE CAN'T PLAN USING THESE TRADITIONAL METHODS. I'M I'M SORRY I'M PASSION ABOUT THIS AND I'VE BEEN PASSIONATE TODAY PROBABLY MORE THAN I SHOULD HAVE. SO OKAY PASSIONS GO THANK YOU AND I AND WE COULD SOMEBODY PLEASE LOOK AT THE POSITION LETTER BUTTON. THAT THING DOESN'T WORK. IT'S A IT'S A IT'S A BLACK HOLE I PUT IN POSITION LETTERS YOU GUYS SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN IN YOU'RE NOT GETTING. OKAY THANK YOU SIR. WE WE DO GET LETTERS BY THE WAY I'M [inaudible] OKAY [inaudible] AMENDMENTS. YOU'RE YOU'RE GOING WITH THEM AND THEN WANT TO FLESH OUT THE NON UTILITY OWNED PIECE OF IT GOING. FOR OKAY VERY GOOD. WE HAVE TO HAVE MOTION. YEAH DID YOU HAVE QUESTIONS I GET ASKED TWO QUESTION BECAUSE RESEARCHER. CENTER STERN IS THERE EVIDENCE THAT MIKE READS WORK EFFECTIVELY IN AN EMERGENCY. IS THERE EVIDENCE I WOULD GO TO OUR EXPERTS WHO HAVE BEEN DEPLOYED ON THE FIELD. BEEN USING THEM AT THEIR CRITICAL CIRCUITS FROM MY UNDERSTANDING COSTS YES WE HAVE US SOME EXPERIENCE WE'VE GOT -- A COUPLE OF I CORPORATES ARE IN EXISTENCE AND WE HAVE -- OTHERS THAT WE SET UP. ONE OF THEM IS FOR A LOCAL TRIBE -- THE WE SET UP AND IF THEY HAVE BEEN EFFECTIVE ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT YOU HAVE TO HAVE COVERED THOUGH IS IF ALL YOUR LINES ARE ABOVE GROUND. AND YOU'RE TRYING TO DE ENERGIZED BECAUSE OF WEATHER CONDITIONS AND TREES OR ANYTHING FLYING AROUND. THAT'S AN INHIBITOR BUT IF YOU HAVE THE THE DESIGN AND ENGINEERING IS DONE WITHIN THAT. DEFINED AREA WHERE YOU'RE SEEKING TO PROTECT IT. THEY HAVE BEEN AFFECTED. ENSURE POWER. AND SHARE POWER WITH OTHER. YES YEAH OUR IDEA IN THIS IS DEVELOPING IT FOR A LARGER SYSTEM WE'RE NOT LOOKING TO DEVELOP IT FOR ONE PROJECT CUSTOMER. BUT MORE IN A CIRCUIT OR ON A REGIONAL BASIS A LOT OF TIMES IN OUR SERVICE TERRITORY NEEDS COUNTY. THE WEATHER CONDITIONS MIGHT BE. ADVERSE OUTSIDE OF THAT IMMEDIATE AREA BUT THE TRANSMISSION LINES SPEEDING UP. DON'T GIVE US ANY OTHER OPTIONS IN THOSE SITUATIONS WHERE YOU CAN BRING -- MICROGROOVE INTO THAT COMMUNITY AND NOT HAVE TO RELY ON THAT. EXTERNAL TRANSMISSION SOURCE THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT WERE LIKE. WHEN THERE'S AN OUTAGE WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO BE IRELAND DID? ADD MAJOR DISCONNECTED FROM THE LARGER GRID AN ISLAND COULD BE OF PARTICULAR. THERE ARE STILL MAINTAINING POWER COULD BE A LARGER. GEOGRAPHIC AREAS WELL ALL DEPENDS ON HOW YOUR SYSTEM IS ENGINEERED AND YOUR DIFFERENT PATHS TO GET THERE YOU CAN GET TO THE FREEWAY OR TO THE AIRPORT. BY FREEWARE BY HIGHWAY -- HIGHWAY OR CITY STREETS IT'S THE SAME KIND OF THING TO TELL YOU DESIGNED THE SYSTEM. AROUND WHATEVER CONDITION YOU'RE TRYING TO AVOID. SOME NEW THIS COMMITTEES I WANT TO THANK CENTE STERN FOR BRINGING A SUBJECT MATTER EXPERT. CAN I JUST ADD ON THIS WORKS VERY WELL WITH UNDER GROUNDING AND AND I AND I TO THE I SUPPORT YOUR PUSH ON TO AND AND I THINK THIS ISN'T JUST A MICRO GREED ONLY BILL EITHER WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF BACK UP POWER SO THINK ABOUT AGAIN. A HOSPITAL OR SENIOR CENTER THOSE PLACES THAT REALLY WHEN YOU'RE ON RESPIRATORS OR YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO GO THROUGH A PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFF RIGHT PEOPLE ARE GOING TO GET HURT. TO GO BACK TO DIESEL EVERY SINGLE TIME. IT'S THERE BUT IT'S NOT RELIABLE DURING A FIRE I I WAS LITERALLY HAULING TANKS A DIESEL PASSED THE THE BLOCKADES TO TRY TO GET OUR URGENT CARE CENTER BACK UP AND RUNNING BECAUSE SOMEONE NEED A TECHNICIAN. I MEAN THAT'S NOT A GOOD SITUATION TO BE IN IN A FIRE SO I THINK. IT'S MORE THAN JUST. MICROGRAMS ARE THE ONLY WAY TO SOLVE THIS I THINK IT'S GONNA BE A HOST OF SOLUTIONS TO DEAL WITH THIS. THIS CITY SYSTEM BUT BUT I YEAH I APPRECIATE THAT THE INTEREST I THINK THERE'S AN INTEGRATED WITH MOVIES FOR THANK YOU -- DON YES -- I'D LIKE ALSO -- APPLIED TO HER STERN FOR BRING THIS UP THE AND IN MY DISTRICT -- YOU KNOW -- SB NINE A ONE I SUPPOSE EVEN. THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO DO IT -- BECAUSE SB NOT A ONE HAD NOT BEEN A FACTOR THAT THE CITY OF CALISTOGA WAS SHUT DOWN. NO WHERE. I WAS THERE ANY WILDFIRE IMMINENT IN THE CITY OF CALISTOGA BECAUSE THE TRANSMISSION LIGHTS WENT THROUGH THERE. YEAH THEY WERE SHOT DOWN THEIR RESTAURANTS WERE SHUT DOWN THEIR HOTELS WERE SHUT DOWN. GROCERY STORES HOSPITALS. I I JUST THINK THIS IS -- YOU KNOW WHAT THE ONE ELEMENT OF BILL THAT ADDRESSES THAT'S THE MICRO GRADS. IS WELL THOUGHT OUT AND I'D LIKE THEY GUESTS THE GENIE. I THINK FOR IN MAY IN MANY CASES FOR DOING THE RIGHT THING. I NOT ONLY OF THIS BUT AS YOU AFTER THE WEATHER STATIONS AND EVERYTHING ELSE TO TRY TO HELP -- YOUR CUSTOMERS OUR CUSTOMERS -- YOU'LL GET THROUGH THESE CALAMITIES [inaudible] THANK YOU. DO WE HAVE A MOTION. WE HAVE A MOTION. DID YOU WANNA MAKE ANY CLOSING COMMENTS BACK GAS FOREVER THANK YOU A QUICK PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. SB SEVEN SEVEN FORTY PASSES AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS WESSEL BY WITH SO I MORE LOT BRADFORD. BRADFORD AYE TING. TING AYE DODD AYE DODD AYE HERTZBERG HILL. HILL I MCGUIRE RUBIO. THE AYE SKINNER AYE STERN. STERN ICE DOWN WIENER. WIENER AYE. THE BILL HAS ENOUGH VOTES TO GET OUT WILL IT WILL KEEP THE ROLE OF THE PROPS OF MEMBERS AND WILL WELCOME OUR NEXT PRESENTER. CENTER CABALLERO WELCOME. ITEM SIX SB. THREE EIGHTY SIX GOOD AFTERNOON. MISTER CHAIR AND SENATORS I LET ME START OFF BY SAYING I WILL TAKE THE TWO OF THE SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS ONE TO DELETE THEM MERCED RIVER. RIVER PROJECT REFERENCE. AND NUMBER TWO TO INSURE THAT THE HYDRO. OUR PS CREDITS. IS LIMITED TO MEET THE COMPLIANCE. REQUIREMENTS FOR TURLOCK AND MODESTO IRRIGATION DISTRICT. IN REGARDS TO THE SUGGEST A REPORT ON THE DISTRICTS ALREADY FILED THE OUR PS COMPLIANCE REPORTS WITH THE ENERGY COMMISSION. AT THE END OF EVERY COMPLIANCE PERIOD WHICH IS EVERY THREE YEARS AND THEY FILE AN ANNUAL POWER CONTENT LABEL WHICH PROVIDES AN OVERVIEW OF THE DISTRICT POWER SOURCES IN ROUTE READ YOUR RENEWABLE ENERGY PROFILING AND SO. RATHER THAN -- A REPORT IF WE COULD JUST RECEIVED A LETTER FROM THE ENERGY COMMISSION UPDATING THE LEGISLATURE ON THE PROGRESS OF THE DISTRICT'S. PROGRESS TOWARDS -- OUR PS COMPLAINTS I THINK THAT MY THAT WOULD PROBABLY BE BETTER. AND SO THAT'S FINE THAT'S GREAT GETTING TO WHAT WE WERE INTERESTED GREAT THAT'S THAT'S WHAT I FIGURED THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SB THREE EIGHTY SIX WOULD ALLOW THE TURLOCK IN MODESTO IRRIGATION DISTRICTS WHICH JOINT JOINTLY ON THE DON PEDRO HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT TO RECOGNIZE AS RENEWABLE THE HYDRO ELECTRIC POWER THEY GENERATE TO MEET THE RENEWABLE PROCUREMENT REQUIREMENTS. THIS IS A DISTRICT BELL AND THE INTENT IS TO PROVIDE ECONOMIC RELIEF AND EQUITY TO THESE IRRIGATION DISTRICTS AND THE RATE PAYERS THAT ALREADY PRODUCE ZERO CARBON ENERGY. LAST YEAR NEW RENEWABLE ENERGY REQUIREMENTS WERE PASSED INTO LAW. WITH SB ONE HUNDRED THE REQUIREMENTS DICTATE THAT RENEWABLE ENERGY SOUL TO RETAIL AND USE IT CUSTOMERS. INCREASE UNTIL THEY REACH A 100% ZERO CARBON ELECTRICITY BY. TWENTY FORTY FIVE THE GOALS ARE LAUDABLE AND WORTHY BUT THE CURRENT SYSTEM HAS INEQUITIES THAT WE SHOULD NOT IGNORE AND THEY'VE BEEN HISTORICAL INEQUITIES SINCE THE OUR PS SYSTEM WAS WAS THAT WAS DESIGNED. TURLOCK IRRIGATION DISTRICT AND MODESTO IRRIGATION DISTRICT FIRST BEGAN PROVIDING CARBON FREE HYDRO ELECTRIC ENERGY TO CUSTOMERS IN. NINETEEN TWENTY THREE GENERATED FROM THE JOINTLY OWNED AND OPERATED DON PEDRO RESERVOIR IN NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE NEW DON PEDRO CONSTRUCTION WAS COMPLETED TO INCREASE PLANT CAPACITY. DESPITE OWNING THIS RESORT RESOURCE. ASIAN DISTRICT WAS REQUIRED TO BUILD A THE FOUR MEGAWATT SOLAR POWER PLANT IN JANUARY TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN IN ORDER TO MEET. THEIR OUR PS REQUIREMENTS THIS SOLAR PLANT COST A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS OVER TWENTY YEARS. LIKEWISE SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE MODESTO IRRIGATION DISTRICT HAS INVESTED SIXTY MILLION IN CAPITAL FOR THE MCENERY SOLAR POWER PLANT. THESE INVESTMENTS WERE REQUIRED SOLELY BECAUSE HYDROELECTRIC POWER GENERATED AT THE NEW DON PEDRO IS NOT RECOGNIZED IN THE OUR PS. THE DISTRICT S. THE FAILURE TO COUNT THIS HYDROELECTRIC PRODUCTION WILL COST OVER A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN ORDER TO REACH THEIR TWENTY THIRTY GOALS AND THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. EXPENDITURES ARE UNDERTAKEN DIRECTLY BY RATE PAYERS IN A REGION CONSISTENTLY CONSIDERED ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED I CURRENT ENERGY RATE. TURLOCK IRRIGATION DISTRICT WILL NEED TO INVEST THREE HUNDRED MILLION MORE OVER THE NEXT TWENTY YEARS. TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS. BOTH DISTRICTS ARE FORCED TO MAKE MASSIVE CAPITAL INVESTMENT IN UNNECESSARY AND NOT UNNECESSARY PROJECTS FOR THEM WELL SIMON SIMULTANEOUSLY DEVALUING ITS OWN RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCE. TO BE CLEAR THESE IRRIGATION DISTRICT PROVIDE WATER AND ELECTRICITY TO THE RATE PAYERS. THE ENERGY PRODUCED BY THE SOLAR PURCHASES IS NOT NEEDED FOR THEM TO MEET THEIR RATE PAYERS NEEDS. THIS DIVERT TO RATE PAYER MONEY FROM IS STAYING IN THE LOCAL ECONOMY AND STAND STEAD SENT IT OUT. OF THE REGION TO SOLAR ENERGY PRODUCERS. ENERGY COSTS ARE THE HIGHEST IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY WHERE IT IS VERY HOT IN THE SUMMER AND VERY COLD IN THE WINTER. AND THE TIERED RATE SYSTEM HURT FOR REPAIRS THE MOST. ADDITIONALLY TURLOCK IRRIGATION DISTRICT IS ONE OF EIGHT BALANCING AUTHORITIES IN THE STATE AND HAS TO BALANCE RETAIL DEMAND GENERATION AND MUST MEET MAINTAIN RELIABILITY. BOTH SOLAR AND WIND AND YOUR ENERGY OR INTERMITTENT SOURCES AND CANNOT PROVIDE DIRECT RELIABILITY THAT THEY REALLY NEED. TURLOCK IN MODESTO IRRIGATION DISTRICTS WOULD HAVE TO SECURE ADDITIONAL ENERGY THEY DO NOT NEED SIMPLY TO MEET THE NEW AND DATE. INSTEAD OF LOCKING UP MONEY NOW FOR SOLAR THE DISTRICTS MUST THEN SELL OFF AT A LOSS ALLOWING THEIR HYDRO TO COUNT WILL FREE UP REPAIR FRIEND TO GO TOWARDS GETTING THEM TO THEIR 1100% CARBON FREE AND GRADE RELIABILITY. LIKE STORAGE -- LIKE STORAGE. SB THREE EIGHTY SIX IS A NARROW BELL THAT WILL BRING MUCH NEEDED ECONOMIC RELIEF TO COMMUNITIES AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY. I ASK YOU TO CONSIDER THE CALIFORNIA PRODUCES A MUCH SOLAR ENERGY THAT IT. THAT IT HAS TO PAY OTHER STATES TO TAKE IT TO AVOID AN OVERLOAD -- SO THERE ISN'T GOING ANYWHERE LAST YEAR THE STATE APPROVED AT ALL NEW HOUSES HAVE MUST HAVE SOLAR PANELS THEY WILL STILL HAVE TO MEET THE 1100% ZERO CARBON ENERGY MANDATE BY. TWENTY FORTY FIVE I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. AND HERE WITH ME TODAY IS JAMES MCFALL MODESTO IRRIGATION DISTRICTS AND JOSH WHITE REIMER TURLOCK IRRIGATION DISTRICT. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS SAID JAMES MCCALL AND I'M THE ASSISTANT GENERAL MANAGER OF WITH ELECTRIC RESOURCE DIVISION ADMINISTER RIGESA DISTRICT -- SO IN CHARGE OF ENERGY PROCUREMENT. LIKE THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK IN IN FRONT OF YOU AND I'D ALSO LIKE TO THINK SENATOR CARRIER FOR PUTTING ASIDE HERE. FOR AS YOU HEARD MR GEISHA DISTRICT PROVIDES. YOU'RE ADDITION WATER DOMESTIC WATER FOR THE CITY MODESTO AN ELECTRIC SERVICE. FOR A HUNDRED TWENTY TWO THOUSAND ELECTRIC CUSTOMERS. FOR A MEDIUM SIZED VERTICALLY INTEGRATED UTILITY WITH THE COMMAND OF ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED MEGAWATTS. AND RETAIL ENERGY SALES OF ABOUT TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED GIGAWATT HOURS. WE SUPPORT THIS PROPOSAL TO COUNT LARGE HYDRO TOWARD THE DISTRICTS ARE PS REQUIREMENTS GIVEN THE FINANCIAL IMPACT TO OUR RATE PAYERS IN A REGION THAT IS RECOGNIZED BY THE STATE AS ECONOMICALLY DISTRESSED. APPROXIMATELY 35% OF THE DISTRICTS. ELECTRIC SERVICE. RESIDENTS WHO LIVE WITHIN DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. BUT ASK YOUR GUEST MISTREAT OWNS ABOUT 352% OF THE ROUGHLY TWO HUNDRED MEGAWATT DON FUTURE HYDROELECTRIC FACILITY. ON AVERAGE WE RECEIVE ABOUT 8% OF OUR ANNUAL ENERGY FROM THE FROM THE FACILITY. AND I WOULD LIKE TO STRESS THAT -- THIS ENERGY PRODUCED BY DON PEDRO IS ONLY USED TO SERVE OUR CUSTOMERS ELECTRIC NEEDS NOT SOLD INTO THE MARKET. DURING THE EARLY STAGES OF THE STATE'S OUR PS PROGRAM THE DISTRICT MADE SEVERAL RENEWABLE ENERGY PURCHASES. AND GIVEN THE NASCENT MARKET AT THE TIME PRICES FOR THOSE RIP PURCHASES WERE ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE HIGHER THAN TRADITIONAL POWER PRICES. WE ESTIMATE THAT SINCE. TWENTY TEN EIGHTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN ENERGY COSTS IN ORDER TO PURCHASE RENEWABLE ENERGY. AND WE EXPECTED TO GROW BY AN ADDITIONAL ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS THROUGH. TWENTY THIRTY ALTHOUGH THERE'S NO WAY TO RECOVER THIS CLASS OR VOID COSTS RELATED TO CONTRACTS THAT ARE ALREADY EXECUTED. ALLOWING DON PETER TO COUNT TOWARDS THE OUR PS PROGRAM WOULD SAVE MIT CUSTOMERS AN ESTIMATED FOURTEEN MILLION DOLLARS. THREE TWENTY THIRTY AND WHILE THE SOUNDS MODEST COMPARED TO THE EXPENSE. AS THE AS YOU ALL KNOW EVERY LITTLE BIT HELPS IN A TO THOSE CUSTOMERS IN THOSE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. IN SUMMARY. THE ABILITY TO COUNT THIS LARGE WRITER RESOURCE TOWARDS OUR PS REQUIREMENTS WOULD PROVIDE MUCH NEEDED RELIEF TO OUR RATE PAYERS IN THESE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND I THINK YOU AGAIN FOR BY PROVIDING THIS OPPORTUNITY. VERY WELL -- GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS JOSH WHY AROUND TE GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS MANAGER AT THE TURLOCK IRRIGATION DISTRICT. IT'S MY PLEASURE BEING FROM THE COMMITTEE TODAY TO TEST. FOR THE SB THREE EIGHTY SIX WE APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR BRING FOR THIS IMPORTANT DISTRICT BILL. AND HELP TO PROVIDE YOU WITH SOME CONTACT AROUND OUR UNIQUE SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES IN OUR DISTRICT. YEAH HE WAS STABBED US IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN AS THE FIRST PUBLICLY OWNED IRRIGATION DISTRICT IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. TODAY EIGHTY EIGHTY PROVIDES -- GEISHA WATER TO MORE THAN FIFTY EIGHT HUNDRED GROWERS OVER SERVICE TERRITORY THAT IS. A HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND ACRES. IN ADDITION TO EIGHTY PROVIDES RELIABLE AND AFFORDABLE ELECTRICITY TO A GROWING RETAIL CUSTOMER BASE THAT IT NOW EXCEEDS A HARD THOUSAND RESIDENTIAL. FARM COMMERCIAL INDUSTRIAL MUNICIPAL ACCOUNTS. GIVEN RELIABILITY IS OF UTMOST CONCERN TO OUR WE ARE ALSO ON BALANCING THE FORTY WHICH MEANS THAT WE HAVE THE REQUIREMENTS TO PROVIDE MOMENT TO MOMENT GRID RELIABILITY. TO OUR SERVICE TERRITORY DIRECTLY IMPACTING THE TYPE AND GENERATION WE OWN AND OPERATE. DE ID HAS A DIVERSE PORTFOLIO THAT INCLUDES WIND SOLAR GEOTHERMAL SMALL HYDRO. A BIO MASS NATURAL GAS AND LARGE HYDRO. WE'VE ALWAYS COMPLIED WITH THE R. P. S.. AND IN. TWENTY EIGHTEEN ARE RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO CENTER WAS 20%. DE ID IS UNIQUE AMONG UTILITIES DO THE FACT THAT WE OVER WE ARE OVER SUPPLIED WITH EXISTING POWER AND HAVE NO UNMET LONG TERM RESOURCE NEEDS. WE ARE ALSO UNIQUE IN THAT WE ALONG WITH OUR PARTNERS IN MY DE OWN AND OPERATE THE DUMB PETER PROJECT ON THE TO ON THE RIVER. A DON PEDRO PROJECT IS NOT PART OF EITHER THE STATE OR FEDERAL PROJECT. A RATHER IS BUILT BY THE DISTRICTS AND IS LOCALLY OWNED OPERATED AND FINANCED BY US. ON AVERAGE DON PEDRO PROVIDES LOAD. BUT IN BUT DURING WHAT YEARS THIS CAN BE AS HIGH AS 35% -- PEDRO'S OPERATE ON A WATER FIRST PRIORITY MEANING THAT RELEASES ARE MADE FOR ENVIRONMENTAL IN IRRIGATION DEMANDS AND THE POWER PRODUCES NOT SOLD INTO THE MARKET. RATHER THE CARBON FREE RESOURCE IS SUPPLIED TO T. ID'S CUSTOMERS. YETI SPORTS THE STATE'S CARBON GOALS AND HAVE SUBMITTED IN OUR INTEGRATED RESOURCES PLAN OUR PLAN TO ME SB ONE HUNDRED PLANNING GOALS. HOWEVER IF THE ANGLES THE SAME COUNTING OUR HYDRO NOW WOULD ALLOW FOR NEW TECHNOLOGIES TO DEVELOP THAT COULD ASSIST WITH. REQUIREMENTS OF BEING A BOUNCING AUTHORITY RATHER THAN GOING OUT TO BID FOR POWER PURCHASE AGREEMENTS WE DON'T NEED. CAN'T USE OF COST EFFECTIVELY HOUSE OUR CUSTOMERS LOAD. WE SIMPLY WANT TO COUNT THE EXISTING COVER FOR YOU YOUR RESOURCES THAT OUR CUSTOMERS HAVE PAID. FOR DOES NOT REMOVED THE ID'S NEED FOR FUTURE PROCUREMENT OF RENEWABLE ENERGY AS MOST CERTAINLY ALL FUTURE POWER PURCHASES WILL BE RENEWABLE. IT SIMPLY ALLOWS T. ID TO AVOID BUYING BUYING POWER THAT WE DON'T CURRENTLY HAVE A NEED. FOR IN SUMMARY TID SUPPORTS SB THREE EIGHTY SIX BECAUSE AS A COMMONSENSE MEASURE. THAT WOULD PROVIDE THE NEEDED RECOGNITION FOR OUR RATE PAYERS EARLY INVESTMENT IN CARBON FREE GENERATION. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TODAY TO SHARE T. A. B. C. NEWS STORY. THE AUTHORS WERE TO WE HAVE OTHERS SPEAKERS IN SUPPORT. MISSION IS WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR AFTER THIS IMPORTANT DISTRICT BILL AND MOVING THE CONVERSATIONFORWARD ON THIS -- IMPORTANT ISSUE THANK YOU TO HAVE OPPOSITION. YOU I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THEM THE MOVING OF THE GOAL POSTS IN THE R. P. S. -- HOW WILL IT THERE AT THE OUR PS IS RELATED TO THE CONTENT LABEL WHICH WERE FORCED TO STATEWIDE BE ABLE TO COMPARE? AND SO HOW WILL THIS LARG HYDRO THAT'S NOW ELIGIBLE HYDRO SHOW UP ON THEIR I I IS THERE SOMETHING SHOULD BE IN THERE TO SAY IT'S NOW ELIGIBLE LARGE FIGHT GO. AND THE SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY. 31% TO DROP IN -- CARBON SINCE TWO THOUSAND ONE BUT NO GOES UP AND DOWN. I HAVE A CHART THAT DOES EVERY COUNTY IN THE STATE. ARE THE AND THE REASON WHY PASSION ABOUT THIS IS. I AM I HEAR PEOPLE SAY IT'S MUCH GREAT EVERYTHING ELSE. 35% INCREASE IN CARBON. 35% INCREASE CARBON THEY DO NOT DELVER THE RENEWALS THAT'S MY PASSION. I DON'T WANT GOAL POST MOVE I ACTUALLY CUT LOOK AT THE OUR PS THINGS LIKE THIS IS SOME ARTIFICIAL THINGS BECAUSE OF PEOPLE TO DO THINGS. MAKE. DECISIONS ON BUYING STUFF IF THEY WERE TO FOCUS ON THE CARBON. WORK FROM THE HIGHEST CARBON -- AREA TO THE LOWEST. THAT'S HOW A BUSINESS CUTS ARE COST AND AND DOES IT MOST EFFECTIVELY SO I HAVE SOMETHING IN THERE TO NOTE THAT THE POWER CONTENT A LITTLE IS RELATED. HAVE SOMETHING IN THERE SO THAT WHEN WE LOOK AT THEY LOOK AT IT WE KNOW THIS IS A SPECIAL CASE. AND THEY DIDN'T JUST SUDDENLY JUMP THANK YOU THANK YOU WELLS YES. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ON MORE WAS LYNN WITH THE UNION OF CONCERNED SCIENTISTS HERE TODAY OPPOSING THE BILL BECAUSE WE BELIEVE. IT'S UNNECESSARY GIVEN THE FLEXIBILITY THAT'S CURRENTLY IN THE LAW IT WOULD CREATE AN UNLEVEL PLAYING FIELD FOR UTILITIES ACOSS THE STATE AND IT WOULD UNDERMINE ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT AND MOST SUCCESSFUL PROGRAMS FOR CLEAN ENERGY ADVANCEMENT IN OUR STATE. BY AND LARGE LARGE HYDRO CROSS THE COUNTRY ACROSS OUR PS PROGRAMS IN THE COUNTRY IS NOT. YES ELIGIBLE BECAUSE ONE OF THE PRIMARY PURPOSES OF IN OUR PS IS TO ENCOURAGE. INVESTMENT IN NEW CLEAN ENERGY RESOURCES AND REDUCE RELIANCE ON FOSSIL RESOURCES. CALIFORNIA VERY DELIBERATELY EXCLUDED LARGE HYDRO FROM ITS OUR PS BECAUSE SOME UTILITIES IN CALIFORNIA HAVE A LOT OF IT ESPECIALLY DURING GOOD WATER YEARS. AND IT WOULD CREATE A VERY UNEVEN PLAYING FIELD FOR UTILITIES IN TERMS OF MEETING THERE ARE YES MEETING SOME UTILITIES WOULD HAVE A VERY LOW COMPLIANCE BURDEN WHILE OTHER ONES WOULD HAVE A VERY HIGH COMPLIANCE BURDEN. FOR EXAMPLE IF THIS BILL PASSED TURLOCK IRRIGATION DISTRICTS WOULD LIKELY NOT NEED TO MAKE ANY CLEAN ENERGY INVESTMENTS. FOR A GOOD NUMBER OF YEARS ALMOST A DECADE. WHILE CONTINUING TO RELY ON NATURAL GAS AN UNSPECIFIED MARKET PURCHASES FOR A SIGNIFICANT CHUNK OF ITS RETAIL SALES IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN THAT WAS 40%. WE'RE NOBLES TODAY ARE EXTREMELY COST EFFECTIVE AND THE PROVIDE BENEFITS TO GO BEYOND CARBON CALIFORNIA ACTUALLY PASSED ITS FIRST OUR PS IN TWO THOUSAND TWO BECAUSE IT WANTED TO MAKE UTILITIES LESS VULNERABLE TO SUPPLY SHORTAGES FROM ANY ONE FUEL TYPE. ONE OF THE MAJOR IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE IS GOING TO BE HIGH HOTTER AND DRIER WEATHER WHICH MEANS LESS ABILITY TO GENERATE HYDROPOWER OVER TIME. WHEN A UTILITY IS HEAVILY RELIANT ON LARGE HYDRO AND FINDS A WAY TO NOT MAKE INVESTMENT IN RENEWABLES? WHAT ARE THEY GONNA PURCHASE DURING THE DRY YEARS THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO SCRAMBLE AND THEY'RE PROBABLY GONNA HAVE TO PURCHASE NATURAL GAS AND THAT'S NOT GOOD FOR REPAIRS AND THAT'S NOT GOOD FOR THE ENVIRONMENT? FINALLY THERE ARE ALREADY PROVISIONS IN THE LAW THAT PROVIDE UTILITIES WITH FLEXIBILITY IF THEY CAN'T MEET THEIR OUR PS TARGETS FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS INCLUDING COSTS. WE BELIEVE THIS BILL IS UNNECESSARY AND WOULD CREATE AN OPENING FOR OTHER UTILITIES WITH HYDRO IN THEIR PORTFOLIO. TO ASK FOR SIMILAR TREATMENT WHICH WOULD UNDERMINE THE PROGRAM FOR THESE REASONS I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR NO VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MATT FREEMAN ON BEHALF OF TURN WE'RE HERE IN STRONG OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. I'M AS I'M IS WHISTLING POINTED OUT THE RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STANDARD IS THE CENTRAL POLICY MECHANISM THAT THE STATE HAS TO ACHIEVE ITS LONG TERM CLIMATE AND ENERGY GOALS AND THIS BILL UNFORTUNATELY. WOULD DO SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE TO THE DURABILITY AND SUCCESS OF THE STATE'S OUR PS PROGRAM. IT'S ALSO COMPLETELY UNNECESSARY I'M AND IT WOULD PROVIDE UNFAIR TREATMENT TO ONE SET OF RETAIL PROVIDERS. THE LEGISLATURE HAS TAKEN STEPS IN RECENT YEARS TO ACCOMMODATE THE SITUATION FOR PUBLICLY OWNED UTILITIES THAT HAVE A LARGE SHARE OF HYDROELECTRIC GENERATION IN THEIR PORTFOLIOS. THERE HAVE BEEN PROVISIONS IN SB THREE FIFTY AN SP ONE HUNDRED TO ADDRESS UTILITIES THAT HAVE HIGH RELIANCE ON IN ADDITION THE LEGISLATURE HAS ADOPTED A COST CAP. THAT HAS BEEN UTILIZED BY THE MERCED IRRIGATION DISTRICT IN OTHER WORDS IF IT COSTS TOO MUCH TO COMPLY WITH THE OUR PS TARGETS. AND IRRIGATION DISTRICT HAS THE RIGHT. TO ESTABLISH A COST CAP AND TO EXERCISE THAT COST CAP AS A WAY TO PREVENT IT FROM BUYING RESOURCES THAT IN THE WORDS OF THE SPONSORS. THEY DON'T NEED AND THEY FIND TO BE TOO EXPENSIVE. WE BELIEVE THIS ISSUE HAS FUNDAMENTALLY ALREADY BEEN ADDRESSED. PROBLEM IS THAT THE INCLUSION OF A LARGE HYDROELECTRIC ASSETS IN THE OUR PS PROGRAM WOULD SIMPLY UP AND THE CAREFULLY DEVELOPED ELIGIBILITY RULES AND IT COULD LEAD TO A MASSIVE REDUCTION IN THE ANTICIPATED QUAL QUANTITY OF NEW RENEWABLE ENERGY. THAT'S SUPPOSED TO BE PRODUCED UNDER THE STANDARD. I'M NOT QUITE SURE HOW WE WOULD DISTINGUISH SITUATION FOR MODESTO INTERLOCK FROM THOSE OF MANY OF THE OTHER PUBLICLY OWNED AN INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES THAT HAVE SUBSTANTIAL LARGE HYDRO ELECTRIC RESOURCES IN THEIR PORTFOLIO. IF EVERYONE WERE ALLOWED TO COUNT THOSE RESOURCES THAT OWN THEM. WE WOULD SEE APPROXIMATELY A 15% REDUCTION IN THE OUR PS. PROGRAM IN OTHER WORDS INSTEAD OF UTILITIES HAVING TO GET 233% BY TWENTY TWENTY THEY WOULD ONLY HAVE TO GET EFFECTIVELY 218%. WHICH WOULD TAKE US WELL BELOW THE TARGETS THAT WERE ADOPTED IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWO BY THIS LEGISLATURE. WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT THAT'S APPROPRIATE. IN ADDITION I WOULD POINT OUT THAT BOTH TURLOCK AND MODESTO DID APPROVE RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STANDARD PROCUREMENT PLANS IN NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER OF LAST YEAR AFTER THE ENACTMENT OF SB. ONE HUNDRED BOTH OF THOSE PLANS SHOW THAT THESE TWO IRRIGATION DISTRICTS. ARE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THEIR EXISTING RESOURCE COMMITMENTS THROUGH THE YEAR TWENTY TWENTY FIVE UNDER THE ACCELERATED TARGETS. IT'S ARE CONCERNED THAT THE ADOPTION OF THE RELIEF REQUESTED AND SB THREE EIGHTY SIX WOULD RESULT IN ONE OF TWO OUTCOMES ONE NO NEW PROCUREMENT WOULD BE NEEDED BY THESE UTILITIES ESSENTIALLY IN PERPETUITY UNDER THE EXISTING OUR PS. BUT MORE TROUBLING IT APPEARS TO ALLOW THESE YOUR GEISHA DISTRICTS TO RESELL RENEWABLE POWER THEY ALREADY HAVE UNDER CONTRACT. ESSENTIALLY TO TAKE RESOURCES THAT THEY BOUGHT TO COMPLY WITH THE OUR PS IN ITS CURRENT CONFIGURATION AND TO REMARKET IT TO OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS IN ORDER TO MAKE MONEY OFF OF THOSE INVESTMENTS. IT'S NOT CLEAR TO US THAT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS HAS ACCEPTED TODAY DO YOU PREVENT THAT OUTCOME. WE THINK AT A MINIMUM THE ENERGY COMMISSION SHOULD BE IN CHARGE OF OF ISSUING A REPORT TO STUDY THE POTENTIAL CONSEQUENCES OF THESE CHANGES -- AND WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT AMENDMENT FROM THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS ADOPTED BUT FUNDAMENTALLY WE BELIEVE THAT THE COST CAP LIMITATION. IS SUFFICIENT TO DEAL WITH THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THESE IRRIGATION DISTRICTS AND IF THIS BILL WERE TO MOVE FORWARD AND TO BECOME LAW. YOU CAN BE GUARANTEED THAT EVERY SINGLE HYDRO OWNING UTILITY WILL HAVE A BILL BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE NEXT YEAR SEEKING IDENTICAL RELIEF AND THAT WILL ON WINE THE STATE'S POLICY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MY NAME IS DAN JACOBSON WITH ENVIRONMENT CALIFORNIA TODAY ALSO REPRESENTING THE ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE FUND WERE POSTED THE BILL. REALLY FOR A COUPLE OF KEY REASONS THREE NOBLE PORTFOLIO STANDARD HAS BEEN THE BEST. THE STATE HAS HAD FOR REDUCING CALIFORNIA'S CLIMATE POLLUTION. THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD AND OTHERS HAVE NOTED THIS IT'S NOT. ON IMPORTANT IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT AS THE STATE IS THE COUNTRY AS THE WORLD LOOKS TO CALIFORNIA TO BE A LEADER IN REDUCING. THE WORST IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE THAT A PROGRAM LIKE THE YOUR PS IS SO SUCCESSFUL AND IT'S NOT SURPRISING THAT REACHING PROGRAMS LIKE THIS ADOPTED IN OTHER STATES AROUND THE COUNTRY. AND TODAY IS THE AMERICAN LUNG ASSOCIATION HAS WRITTEN. JUST RELEASED THEIR REPORT ON DIRTY AIR IT'S PROGRAMS LIKE THE R. P. S. THAT HELPS TO REDUCE OUR AIR POLLUTION. CALIFORNIA LEADS IN THE WORST AIR POLLUTION ONCE AGAIN WITH CITIES UP AND DOWN THE STATE. CONTINUING TO HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE LAUNCH OF OUR KIDS. THIS PROGRAM HAS BEEN SO SUCCESSFUL FOR THE PAST FIFTEEN EIGHTEEN YEARS HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE DON'T DO ANYTHING TO ROLL BACK WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO ADVANCE AND MOVE THE BALL. JUST AS WE CAN ON PROGRAMS LIKE THIS. RESPECTFULLY URGE A NO VOTE ON THIS THANK YOU. LOT ABOUT ON BEHALF OF THE END OF PRODUCES ASSOCIATION IN OPPOSITION. NUMBER SECURE CROWDED WITH THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL IN OPPOSITION AND RESTATING THE POINTS ALONG THAT COMES WITH THE UC ASKING. THANK YOU. FOR CALLING ON BEHALF OF SIERRA CLUB CALIFORNIA ECHOING THE COMMENTS MADE IN OPPOSITION TODAY URGING YOUR NOTEBOOK [inaudible] MEMBERS. WELL WE DO THAT I'M GONNA STEP UP FOR FIVE MINUTES AND HAVE. AS CHAIR OVER AND I'LL BE RIGHT BACK LOSING GERMAN. DINNER HILL WAS IT DID YOU HAVE YOUR HAND UP TO NUMBER. FIRST LET ME MOVE THE BILL AND LET ME THANK THE SENATOR FOR THIS COMMONSENSE MEASURE. WE'RE HERE TODAY. BECAUSE WE HAVE OUR PS PROGRAM THAT IS NOT TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL. WE EXCLUDED LARGE HYDRO AND SMALL HYDRO OUT OF THAT OUR PS PORTFOLIO SEVENTEEN YEARS AGO AND THIS IS WHY WE'RE HERE TODAY BECAUSE IT WE HAD COUNTED EARLY WHICH IS CLEAN DISPATCH BOWL AND RELIABLE. WE WOULDN'T BE IN THIS POSITION HERE TODAY FOR YOU FIGHTING FOR YOUR COMMUNITY. BUILDING UNNECESSARY RESOURCES THAT MEET OUR COMMON CLIMATE GOALS HI JOE WAS CLEAN IT'S BEEN RELIABLE IT'S DISPATCH WILL. AND AND IT'S IT'S IT'S A SAFE AND TO SIT HERE NOW AND SAY THIS IS HYDRO THE RIGHT TO THE ENVIRONMENT AS FOR PERSON WHO SPENT FOUR YEARS AT LA CONSERVATION CORPS. AND BIOLOGY MAJOR IT'S INSULTING BECAUSE THAT'S THE FARTHEST THING FROM THE TRUTH AND WE WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN EMBRACE HYDRO BUT WE WERE SELLING TECHNOLOGY. AND TO SIT HERE TODAY AND SAY THAT WIND AND SOLAR IS ABOUT CLIMATE. WHEN WE MOVED TO WIN IN SOLAR THIRTY YEARS AGO IT WAS ABOUT GETTING OFF OF FOREIGN OIL IT WAS DUE? TO THE DECISION TO GET RID OF FOREIGN OIL HEARING. ARE CALIFORNIA IN AMERICA AND THAT'S WHY WE START BUILDING WIND AND SOLAR LONGER CAN FREEWAY DONNA RIVERSIDE COUNTY IN PALM SPRINGS IT WASN'T ABOUT CLIMATE ONCE WE REALIZED WE COULD MAKE MONEY ON SELLING. WHEN UNTIL IT BECAME ABOUT THE MONEY SO I SAVE ALL THE MONEY THIS IS A COMMONSENSE MEASURE AND I SUPPORT? ANY OTHER COLLEAGUES SENATOR [inaudible] NANCY SKINNER [inaudible] I'M. IT IS TRUE THAT OUR OUR PS IS NOT TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL. BUT THIS ACTUALLY. WHILE THE FEAR IS BY SOME OF THE OPPONENTS THAT THIS WOULD OPEN UP. YOUR PS -- TWO BIG HYDRO IN TERMS OF YOUR COM MY COLLEAGUES% COMMENTS FROM GUARDINO IT IT. DOESN'T NECESSARILY DO THAT IT DOES IT DOES IN EFFECT CARVE OUT FOR A COUPLE OF YOUR NATION. AND I NOTE IN THE ANALYSIS OUR COMMITTEE ANALYSIS WHICH ONCE AGAIN. I THINK OUR COMMITTEE ANALYSIS HI IN THIS SET OF BILLS THAT WE HAVE IN THIS BINDER TODAY I MEAN THERE IT'S USUALLY VERY VERY GOOD I'M ALWAYS IMPRESSED BY ITS VERY IMPRESSIVE TODAY. AND IT INDICATES THAT. AS HAS BEEN MENTIONED ON THAT HE ARE YOU USE WHICH THE IRRIGATION DISTRICTS THAT ARE AFFECTED BY THIS BILL OUR HAVE LOTS OF ADDITIONAL OPTIONS TO COMPLY WITH YORK YES. AND THEY ALSO HAVE -- MORE COST LIMITATION OPTIONS. SO AND AS WAS. INDICATED ALREADY IN TESTIMONY THE ASIAN DISTRICTS HAVE OPTED FOR THOSE THINGS AND OF ALREADY EVEN MADE THEIR PROCUREMENTS THREE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE SO. I DON'T SEE THE NECESSITY FOR THIS BILL RIGHT NOW AND DUE TO THE FEAR THAT IT WOULD CAUSE OTHER. ENTITIES TO WANT TO COME TO US AND OPEN UP THEN THIS KIND OF CAN OF WORMS [inaudible] I'M. I DON'T THINK IT'S WISE TO DO IT RIGHT NOW [inaudible] AND I'M. ADDITIONALLY. THAT WHILE I UNDERSTAND I DIDN'T HEAR THE OPENING THAT YOU ARE TAKING SOME AMENDMENTS. THE THERE IS COMMITTEE REFERENCE ON IN THE ANALYSIS ABOUT. LIMITING THE ABILITY TO SELL. THIS SUPPLY AND ALSO REQUIRING THE ENERGY COMMISSION TO DO THAT REPORT AND I DON'T BELIEVE THOSE WERE. OKAY REPORT WAS NOT RIGHT SO IT. IF I IF I MAY THROUGH THE CHAIR. I'M THE THAT THE INFORMATION IS ALWAYS IS ALREADY REQUIRED TO GO TO TO THE ENERGY COMMISSION AND SO RATHER THAN ASK THE COMMISSION TO DO A REPORT. IT'S TO DO A LETTER -- IS SO WE WE WE JUST CHANGED IT SO THAT WE'RE NOT ASKING FOR A FULL REPORT IS JUST THE DATA THAT'S BEING GIVEN. I'M ON OUT ON A ANNUAL BASIS THAT IS ALREADY REQUIRED AS PART OF THE REPORTING. I'M. WE DID TAKE THE ON THE OTHER AMENDMENT [inaudible] FIVE SO THAT'S AN IMPROVEMENT BUT I THINK FUNDAMENTALLY. IT'S STILL NOT CLEAR WHY? THIS BILL IS NEEDED. BECAUSE BE I'M. THE ADDITIONAL RELIEF. AGAIN MAYBE THERE MAYBE THEY'LL BE A DEMONSTRATION CAST TWENTY TWENTY FIVE AT LEAST DISTRICTS WILL NEED SOME ADDITIONAL RELIEF. BUT BUT SO FAR. THERE IS NO -- THERE'S BEEN NO DEMONSTRATED NEED FOR THAT. RELEASED. BY THE DISTRICTS OWN ACTION. AND IN FACT -- THE MERCED. CATION DISTRICT AS FAR AS I KNOW IT'S NOT EVEN BEEN THAT ENGAGED IN THE BILL SO. I'M I'M NOT COMFORTABLE MOVING FORWARD I DO APPRECIATE THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO ADDRESSING NEED YOUR DISTRICT BUT IT'S NOT CLEAR THAT THAT NEED [inaudible] IS [inaudible] THAT THERE. IT MAY BE MORE CLEAR THAT THERE IS A NEED IN A FEW YEARS BUT AT THIS MOMENT IT'S NOT CLEAR THAT THAT NEEDS PRESS [inaudible] OKAY. SENATE COVER EURO -- WOULD YOU PLEASE RESPOND TO SOME OF THE ARGUMENTS THAT WE'VE HEARD IN OPPOSITION YOUR BILL THAT I'D LIKE TO ASK A COUPLE QUESTIONS YES THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR. I'M A FIRST OF ALL LET ME JUST SAY THAT -- MERCED IS ONE OF THE AMENDMENTS IS IS NOT INCLUDED IN OTHER WORDS WILL BE. ELIMINATED FROM THE BILL SO THE ISSUE THAT WAS RAISED WITH MERCED -- THEY'RE THEY'RE ON A DIFFERENT TRACK. AND INITIALLY WHEN WE WERE WORKING ON THE BILL THEY WANTED TO BE INCLUDED IN NOW DON'T. SO THEY'RE NOT INCLUDED -- WILL BE -- AMENDED OUT AND THEN -- IN REGARDS TO THE THE THE NEED TO DO THIS AT THIS PARTICULAR POINT IN TIME IS THAT M.. IN IN ANY. IN ANY PROCESS YOU HAVE TO PLAN AND YOU HAVE TO START SPENDING MONEY AND YOU HAVE TO START -- FIGURING OUT HOW YOU GET A FINANCE -- THESE PARTICULAR PROJECTS ARE NOT CHEAP -- THESE IRRIGATION DISTRICTS HAVE SPENT MILLIONS OF DOLLARS -- TO GET THEMSELVES UP TO COMPLIANCE ARE NOT ASKING TO ROLL BACK THAT COMPLIANCE THEY THEY WILL THEY HAVE LONG TERM CONTRACTS IT WILL STAY IN THOSE LONG TERM CONTRACTS. AND THOSE ARE COMMITMENTS THAT THEY MAKE THEY MADE AND QUITE FRANKLY THAT ENERGY THEY BUY AT A PREMIUM AND THEY SELL IT OFF. THEY HAVE TO SELL IT CHEAP TO TO PEOPLE OUTSIDE OF THE STATE THEY DON'T NEED IT WE DON'T NEED IT IN THE STATE SO. WE ARE CREATING THIS OBLIGATION ON THE AIR GET IRRIGATION DISTRICT -- TO BY THESE -- EXPENSIVE SOLAR AND WIND PROJECTS AND THEN TO SELL OFF THE ENERGY AT A LOSS TO THEIR TO THE RATE PAYERS AND AND THAT'S THAT'S REALLY WHY YOU NEED WE NEED THIS BILL NOW. IS BECAUSE THERE ARE THERE ARE PLANNING TO SPEND HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN NEW PROJECTS. PAST TWENTY TWENTY FIVE TO BE ABLE TO MEET THE OBLIGATIONS THAT -- IT THAT SB -- ONE HUNDRED PLACES ON THEM NUMBER ONE NUMBER TWO IS THAT -- YOU KNOW I FIND IT INTERESTING AND I AND I REALLY WANNA I WAS GONNA TAKE THAT -- CENTER BRADFORD STE COMMENTS AS MY CLOTHES IS THAT THIS REALLY HIT ME YOU KNOW WHEN YOU WHEN WHEN PEOPLE START TALKING ABOUT UNFAIR TREATMENT. AND IT'LL UNDERMINE THE PROGRAM -- IT KIND OF INFURIATES ME BECAUSE THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT FOR THE MOST PART. ON I'M LEGISLATORS COME FROM URBAN AREAS AND THEY DESIGN THE RULES OF THE GAME TO TO BENEFIT URBAN AREAS AND THEN AS A AS A RULE RESIDENT AND LEGISLATOR TRYING TO GET INTO THE DISCUSSION BECOMES VERY DIFFICULT WHEN ANSWER SB. ONE HUNDRED WAS MAKING ITS WAY AROUND THE LEGISLATURE I TRIED VERY HARD TO GET. THIS KIND OF RELIEF FOR THE IRRIGATION THESE TO PUT TWO IRRIGATION DISTRICTS -- BECAUSE IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE TO THE RATE PAYERS TREMENDOUS DIFFERENCE TO THE RATE PAYERS -- THE REASON THAT. HYDRO WAS NOT INCLUDED HAD TO DO WITH THIS AND INVESTMENT THAT WE WANTED TO MAKE IN OTHER FORMS OF ENERGY SO EVERYBODY. WAS GONNA GET TREATED THE SAME AND IT'S NOT IT'S NOT EQUAL TREATMENT IF IT IS ON THEY THEIR RATE PAYERS. HAVE BEEN HURT. BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN MADE TO INVEST. IN WHAT IS REALLY GOOD ENERGY SOLAR AND AND WIND ENERGY IS TREMENDOUS ENERGY I'M NOT SAYING IT'S NOT BUT BUT AS CENTER BRADFORD SAID WE WE WERE REALLY LOOKING. AT THE REDUCTION OF FOSSIL FUELS WE WANTED TO GET OFF OF THAT AND AND IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH FAIR AT THE BEGINNING. TO SAY WE'RE GONNA CALL HIGH WE'RE GONNA WE'RE GONNA COUNT HYDRO AND LET'S MAKE THE STANDARD FIRE. BECAUSE THEN YOU THEN THEY COULD HAVE GOTTEN CREDIT FOR THEIR OWN ENERGY AND BUT THEY HAD TO MEET HIGHER HIGHER -- TARGETS DOWN THE ROAD. THEY MADE THE INVESTMENTS NOW AND THE RATE PAYERS ARE PAYING FOR SOMEONE ELSE TO GET CHEAPER -- SOLAR ENERGY -- AND THEY'RE NOT ASKING TO TURN BACK THE CLOCK THEY'RE JUST ASKING FOR THAT THE EQUITY THAT -- WILL ALLOW THEM TO TELL THE REPAIRS WE CAN TAKE A DEEP BREATH FOR FOR A MINUTE -- AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE THESE THESE HUGE INVESTMENTS THAT THAT DON'T BENEFIT US WE ARE NOT USING THAT ENERGY. NUMBER ONE IT AND THEN NOT THAT FINALLY THEY'RE NOT ASKING. TO SELL OFF. THE ENERGY THAT THEY PRODUCE FROM HYDRO IF IT ALL GOES TO THE RATE PAYERS. IT IS THAT THEY'RE NOT IN AND WE AGREED TO THAT AS AS AN AMENDMENT AS WELL. SO I'M IMMEDIATE INTO IN TERMS OF OF OF IS THIS A RENEWABLE ENERGY AND IS IT NOT A CLEAN ENERGY I'M IT'S IT'S MIND BOGGLING TO ME THAT ANYBODY WOULD ARGUE THAT IT'S THAT NOT RENEWABLE AND THEN IT'S NOT -- IT'S IT'S NOT [inaudible] CARBON FREE. IT IS. AND SO ON WE JUST IF IT'S A FAIRNESS ISSUE IT'S AN EQUITY ISSUE AND QUITE FRANKLY IT IT IS A REPAIR HUGH. ON THE EQUITY STANDPOINT YOU'RE YOU'RE TRYING TO DO SOMETHING FOR YOUR CONSTITUENTS. BUT IT YEAH I'M KIND OF A NOTE. PERSON SO I'M JUST WONDERING WHY. PERHAPS YOU AND SENATOR BRADFORD DIDN'T DO A BILL THAT SAID THAT HYDRO PRICE. EVERYBODY EVERYBODY SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE THIS [inaudible] DEBATE. FROM MY PERSPECTIVE WHEN I WAS TRYING TO DO IS TO HELP THE RATE PAYERS THAT HAVE BEEN -- BURDENED AND AND IN PARTICULAR IN IN IN A REGION WHERE I'M VERY LUCKY IN -- IN IN THE COASTAL REGION. WE DON'T HAVE AIR CONDITIONING CONDITIONERS IN OUR HOUSE AND IN IN IN THE WINTER AND SUMMER IT'S SIXTY DEGREES ALL YEAR ROUND SO I'M ALWAYS IN THE FIRST YEAR IN TERMS OF PAYING MY ELECTRIC BILLS. BUT I'VE ALSO SPENT TIME IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY YOU BETTER HAVE AN AIR CONDITIONER AND YOU BETTER HAVE A REALLY GOOD HEATER IN THE WINTER. AND SO -- I HAD A LEGISLATOR TELL ME LAST YEAR THAT THAT LIVES FULL TIME IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. THAT HIS ELECTRIC BILL WAS SIX HUNDRED BUCKS ONE ONE OF THE MONTHS BECAUSE HE HAD LITTLE KIDS AT HOME. AND AND THEY NEEDED THE AIR CONDITIONER ON AND I I WAS APPALLED AT THE IDEA THAT YOU HAVE TO PAY THAT THAT MUCH AND AND THAT'S WHAT. THAT'S REALLY WHAT EXEMPLIFIED WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH SHE SAID IT IT. IT IT. IN IN IN A REGION WHERE THE WHERE WHAT YOU USE TENDS TO BE HIGHER IN THAT IN THAT REGARD WHAT YOU DON'T WANT IS TO HAVE A HIGHER RATE BECAUSE YOU YOU'RE TRYING TO MEET SOME -- OBLIGATION THAT'S BEEN SET THAT REALLY DOESN'T BENEFIT YOUR RESIDENTS AT ALL. AND THAT'S WHAT THEY'VE HAD TO DO THEY'VE HAD TO MAKE MAJOR INVESTMENTS AND SO. YOU KNOW MAYBE WE I UNDERSTOOD THE ISSUE IN TERMS OF THESE TWO IRRIGATION DISTRICT DISTRICT BECAUSE I'VE SPENT A LOT OF TIME TALKING TO THEM IN TRYING TO UNDERSTAND HOW HOW THE PROCESS WORKS. I DON'T KNOW HOW IT WORKS IN OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE -- BUT I'VE I FIGURED IF I COULD HELP SOLVE IT HERE -- WE CAN SEE LATER ON WHAT. CAN'T PREDICT WHAT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN LATER ON I DON'T KNOW WHERE THE OTHER HYDRO IS LOCATED IN AND WHAT IT. IMPACT IS QUITE FRANKLY. I DON'T EITHER THAT'S WHY I WAS KIND OF ASKING BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY WANNA STAY RIGID TO A PRINCIPLE. THE RBS TOLD THAT. THAT THAT MAKES NOW. EXEMPTIONS AND THAT'S WHERE THE STRUGGLE IS I'M JUST CURIOUS IN THIS YEAR VALLEY THEN ARE. SINCE YOU'RE PAYING HIGHER RATES PERHAPS WE SUBSIDIZE THAT WITH. I'M SORRY GO AHEAD YOU YOUR LOCAL STORE. DO NOT AGREE ARE ARE THE ARE ARE YOUR REPAIRS TO THE RATES THE RATES ARE HIGHER IT'S THE USAGE THAT SO MUCH HIGHER THAT CAUSES THE HIGHER BILLS IN YOUR SUBSIDIZING THAT [inaudible] THROUGH. WHAT THE RESERVES ARE HIGH I YOU? OR YOU ARE JUST BECAUSE YOU HAVE THE HYDRO YOU CAN AFFORD. TO CHARGE RATES THAT ARE LOWER EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE PAYING HIGHER RATES FOR THE SOUL. I THINK OUR OUR RATES ARE LOWER BECAUSE OF THE DIVERSE PORTFOLIOS THAT WE BOTH HALF AND AND THE THE ACTIONS THAT WE'VE TAKEN OVER THE YEARS TO TRY TO KEEP OUR RATES LOW BECAUSE WE ARE APPEAR YOU -- SO IT IS FAR SUBSIDIZING I DON'T THERE'S NO THERE'S NO FORMA SUBSIDY ALTHOUGH ALL THE REVENUE WE GET GOES BACK GOES BACK TO THE RATE THE RATE PAYERS AREN'T FEELING ANY PAIN. THE REPAIRS ARE THE ONES WHO WHO MUST HAVE A HIGH VOLUME. AND IN IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY YES MOST FOLKS WOULD HAVE HIGHER VOLUMES AND THEN FOLKS ELSEWHERE IN THE STATE LIKE LIKE ON THE COASTAL REGIONS AND STUFF SO SO THAT'S WHAT CAUSES THE HIGHER BILLS EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE THE LOWER RATES YEAH. WELL THEN IN YOUR PARTICULAR AREA WE SUBSIDIZE NAT WITH. SSI BENEFITS AND WELFARE AND ALL THE REST APRIL THE BILL I WOULD. THAT I COULDN'T ONE ZERO GRAM WEDNESDAY PROGRAM YEAH I'VE SETTING AND OTHER. THAT I'M NOT SURE YEAH. ALL RIGHT ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS CENTER STERN YEAH THANK YOU. ARE YOU MISTER CHAIR RIGHT NOW WHO'S MISTER CHAIR HERE MISTER SURE JUST FOR THE MINUTE JUST FOR THE MOMENT. THANK YOU MISTER THANK CENTER FOR BRINGS FORWARD -- I'M STRUGGLING WITH THIS SORT OF RURAL URBAN DIVIDE AND THIS NOTION OF SOME DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT I I WE'RE ONE CALIFORNIA HERE MANY GREAT IS ONE GREAT I KNOW THAT THEIR DISTRICTS IN JURISDICTIONS THAT. HAVE DIFFERENT CHALLENGES TO SEE A WHOLE LOT OF COLD BY THE WAY AND IN. THE DESK SO. 16% OF THE POWER MAKES THERE SO WELL THAT'S WHAT IT SAYS IN THE ANALYSIS FOR OUR COUNTRY. RIGHT BUT SO I MEAN THERE'S GAS. LEFTOVER COAL YOUR CYCLING OUT EVERYONE'S TRYING TO GET OFF THAT BUT THE BROADER ISSUE IS THAT. INLAND OF LOS ANGELES THE INLAND OF ALL THESE OTHER REGIONS WE ALL HAVE CHALLENGES BUT I'D SEE RENEWABLES IS A HUGE OPPORTUNITY I MEAN FRESNO IN KERN COUNTY OR THE RENEWABLE ENERGY. GENERATORS OF THE WORLD KERN MAKES MORE RENEWABLE ENERGY THAN ANY OTHER COUNTY IN THE STATE ANY OTHER REGION IN THE WORLD AND ALSO HAS OIL. TO JUSTIN ENERGY GIANT AND I'M. I I DON'T SEE THIS IS -- THE DARK IS ALREADY COUNTS HYDRO I MEAN IT DOESN'T COUNTY KIND OF HYDRO YOU GUYS WANT BUT IT COUNTS. BUT A SMALL HYDROELECTRIC FACILITY THIRTY MEG WATER LESS PLUS CONDUIT HYDROELECTRIC FACILITIES PLUS INCREMENTAL INCREASES. FROM EFFICIENCY IMPROVEMENTS IN EXISTING FACILITIES I STILL SEE THERE'S ROOM FOR HYDRO I APPRECIATE YOU ALL WANT TO HAVE A BROADER CONVERSATION ABOUT. WE WE DID A DEAL ON SB ONE HUNDRED AND I I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY. A RUN ON WIND IT. HERE. I DON'T SEE THE BURDENS YET -- YOU KNOW I MEAN SANTA CLARITA VALLEY SAN FERNANDO VALLEY THE D. W. P. CUSTOMERS THE EDISON CUSTOMERS TRUST ME WE'RE USING A LOT OF AC TWO IT'S AND IT'S I MEAN. AND THERE'S PLAN I MEAN THE ELECTRIC RATES I THINK YOU GUYS ACTUALLY SOME OF THE LOWEST RATES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AMONG THOSE YOUR OCCASION DISTRICTS OF I'M NOT MISTAKEN. SO I DON'T HEAR THE RATE. ANGST I'M HERE A HECK OF A LOT OPPORTUNITY FOR YOUR DISTRICTS WITH LOCAL RESOURCE IN ASSETS AND PUT PEOPLE TO WORK. SO I JUST WANT TO GET YOUR SENSE OF THAT I MEAN. HEY I READ I RESPECT THAT. YOU GOTTA FIGHT FOR YOUR COMMUNITY AND THIS FEELS BURDENSOME BUT I SEE MORE IS OPPORTUNITY SO I CAN YOU CAN YOU GUYS COME. TO TERMS YOUR STRATEGY MAY GET YOU WANT TO COUNT THINGS YOU'RE ALREADY DOING BASICALLY TORTURE OBLIGATION BUSINESS FROM JUST REDUCE. YOUR OBLIGATION UNDER THE RP A SO LET ME JUST START OFF BY SAYING THERE IS NO. INTENT HERE [inaudible] YOU [inaudible] I'M. NO IN INTENT HERE. TOO DISPARAGE [inaudible] OUR PS. AND IT AND THE SYSTEM THAT WAS SET UP. WHAT THE COMMENT I WAS MAKING IS? HE IS SENATOR YOU RIGHT NOW JUST SAID WEEK WE HAD A DEAL. I'M NOT SURE WHO IS AT THE TABLE BUT I I CERTAINLY WASN'T TALKED TO ABOUT. THE IMPACT ON RURAL IRRIGATION DISTRICT. AND WHEN I TRIED TO BRING IT UP WITH THE AUTHOR. THE ANSWER QUITE FRANKLY WAS I DON'T NEED YOUR VOTE. AND SO THIS IS THE DIRECTION WE'RE GOING TO GO IN NOW I'M NOT BEING DISRESPECTFUL I'M JUST SAYING THAT WAS THAT WAS EXACTLY THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED IN AND FOR THAT REASON -- I DIDN'T SUPPORT IT BUT BUT THESE BOTH OF THESE IRRIGATION DISTRICT. HAVE STEPPED UP. AND THEY'VE MADE VERY EXPENSIVE MULTI MILLION DOLLAR PURCHASES OF SOLAR. IT'S NOT ENERGY THEY NEED FOR THEIR RATE PAYERS. IT IS ENERGY THAT THEY HAVE TO BUY BECAUSE OF THAT REQUIREMENTS. AND THEN THEY HAVE THEY SELL IT OFF IS AT A DISCOUNT. AND SO THE RATE PAYERS ARE PAYING THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THIS INVESTMENT AND THEN HAVING THE ENERGY SOLD OFF. AND AND AND AND AND THE WHOLE POINT OF IT IS IS THAT IT IT WAS A SYSTEM. THAT WAS NOT SET UP THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE FROM FROM MY PERSPECTIVE. AND SO NOW TO SAY WELL YOU BUTTE YOU'RE GONNA UNFAIRLY CHANGE THE SYSTEM. IT JUST DOESN'T WASH WITH ME BECAUSE THE SYSTEM. IT WAS A SYSTEM THAT SPECIFICALLY EXCLUDED HYDRO FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. AND THAT PURPOSE WAS TO GET OFF. THE USE OF FOSSIL FUELS SO. NO I'M NOT I AND I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO HERE. YEAH CENTER SENATOR IS TRY TO BREATH [inaudible] I'M. WE ALL COULD HAVE RESTORATIONS ANY EXPRESSED SOME WITH THE ORIGINAL BILL BUT I THINK THE EXCLUSION OF THAT THE LARGE. BLUE XIN WAS PARTICULARLY DETRIMENTAL TO RURAL AREAS I MEAN. LED W. P.. AT THE POINT THAT THE ARK YES WAS ADOPTED. HAD OVER 25% OF ITS POWER MIX IN LARGE RIGHT. IT SHIP IT NOW JUST IS PURCHASING. JEANNIE AS A 20% MORE TRIED GROWN IT'S MIXED. THE SFPUC. HAS A THREE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FIVE MEGAWATTS OF LARGE HYDRO IN ITS ELECTRICITY MIX. ONLY THIRTEEN MEG WHAT EVERY NOTE SO IT'S JUST NOT. ACCURATE TO PUT IT THAT WAY. AND I'M. I THINK. YOU KNOW THE OBJECTION THAT AT LEAST I HAVE MUCH MORE THAT WE BUILT IN. BE A COST COMPLIANCE MEANING TO BE A COST LIMITATION COMPLIANCE TO PROTECT PO USE AND THE DISTRICTS AB EXERCISES THAT. AND SO IT JUST AGAIN FOR ME IT'S HARD TO SEE WHAT WE NEED IS RIGHT NOW. CENTER BRAD YEAH I I WANNA GO WOULD SOONER STERN STATED THAT WE'RE CLEARLY ONE CALIFORNIA BUT IT'S MANY PARTS OF CALIFORNIA WHO ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE DISCUSSION. OF ENERGY AND VARIOUS POLICIES HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND IN NEED IN KERN COUNTY AREN'T CENTRAL VALLEY IS FAR DIFFERENT FROM LOS ANGELES. BUT AT THE SAME TIME. THE COMMENT THAT WAS MADE THAT NOW. UTILITIES WILL INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES WILL GO BACK SOON HI I MEAN I USING A HYDRO. THEY SOLD OFF THEIR PART POWER PLANTS BECAUSE OF DEREGULATION SO. THEY'RE STILL THERE BUT THEY DON'T ONLY MORE SO THEY WOULD STILL HAVE TO GO OUT AND PURCHASE ARE FROM WHATEVER BUT THIS IS A REVIEW OF ONE TO CONTINUE TO FRAME HYDRO AS IF IT'S NOT RENEWAL. WE SEE IT WORKING IN BRITISH COLUMBIA WE SEE IT WORKING WE HAD TRIED TO DO A DEAL WERE RUNNING THE RIVER IN BC. THE BRING IMPORTS ALL KNOW YOU CAN'T BECAUSE THE BUCKET ONE BUCKET TWO BUCKETS. IT ALL HAS TO BE IN STATE. WE COULD HAVE HAD CHEAPER POWER FIFTEEN TWENTY YEARS AGO IF WE WERE OPEN. TO ALL THE DIFFERENT RESOURCES OUT. ARE AVAILABLE YOU'RE HEARING A COMMUNITY THAT IS NOW BUYING. SOLAR BECAUSE IT'S MANDATE IT BUT SHE ADDING OUT THE LOWER WOULD BECAUSE IT'S ON NECESSARY. THAT IS HUSTLING BACKWARDS TO ME AND THAT MAKES ABSOLUTELY NO SENSE SO IT'S NOT. ENERGY RATE THAT THEY'RE CONCERNED ABOUT IT STEM CONSUMPTION BECAUSE THEY USE MORE ASH OUT THE SENATOR STATED IN THE WINTER AND THE SUMMER AND WE DO. AND COAST TORN URBAN AREAS SO THAT'S TO RULE SHOULD NOT WHAT THE PAPER BUT HOW MUCH THEY HAVE TO USE SO. ALLOWING HIM TO NOT HAVE TO MAKE THOSE UNNECESSARILY UNNECESSARY PURCHASES OF SOLAR OUR INVESTMENT IN SOLAR ONLY THE SHE HAD A PART IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY. THAT'S THE WHOLE DOCTOR VOTE. SO WE'RE TRYING TO FIX THAT IN YOUR HER SHE HAS A SOLUTION TRY TO HELP US FIX TO DUB URBAN WE ALL PULL POINT ON VERY WELL STATED CENTER THANK YOU. OKAY OF SOME NIGHT. YEAH YOU KNOW I CAME IN HERE KIND OF NEUTRAL ON THIS WANTED TO LISTEN TO BOTH SIDESOF IT YOU KNOW I I TOTALLY AGREE THAT WE DO NOT WANT TO SEE INCENTIVIZE. YOUR HYDRO IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA YEAH OUT PARTICULARLY LARGE HYDRO GOING FORWARD. BUT IT SURE SEEMS TO ME AND YOU KNOW I WASN'T HERE AT THE TIME THAT THINGS WERE DONE IT'S AWFULLY EASY. TO TAKE SHOTS AT THE PAST. THE PEOPLE THAT -- IMPLEMENTED THE R. P. S. DID THE BEST THING THEY THOUGHT THEY COULD DO AT THE TIME IS RIGHT. IT JUST BUT WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE SITTING HERE. JUST IGNORING THE FACT. THAT WE DO HAVE A CLEAN SOURCE OF ENERGY. ARE ALREADY [inaudible] BEING GENERATED. AND SO I I I I DON'T KNOW IT'S IT SURE SEEMS TO ME LIKE ON YOU TILL WE DON'T WANT INCENTIVIZE. YOU PARTICULARLY WHERE YOU HAVE. YOUR UTILITIES AND HAVE A LARGE PORTFOLIO OF HYDRO AND HAVE THE WINNERS AND LOSERS THERE IT SEEMS TO ME THAT WE CAN FIGURE OUT. YOUR FORMULAS OF HOW WE DEAL WITH THAT GOING FORWARD. IF THAT THESE ARE BEING USED IN THEIR BEING USED EFFECTIVELY AND IT IS CLEAN ENERGY JUST. I DON'T KNOW FOR ME IT DOESN'T PASS THE SMELL [inaudible] VERY WELL. DID YOU ON MY CLOSING COMMENTS.
