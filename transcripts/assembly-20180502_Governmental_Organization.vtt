WHAT TWENTY THREE AB TWENTY

00:34:17.155 --> 00:34:20.458 region:rollup2
THREE OH EIGHT WOULD DO WOULD BE

00:34:18.790 --> 00:34:23.461 region:rollup2
TO STOP THE SALE OF CIGARETTES

00:34:20.458 --> 00:34:24.596 region:rollup2
IN CALIFORNIA WITH FILTERS?

00:34:23.461 --> 00:34:26.932 region:rollup2
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING WHAT

00:34:24.596 --> 00:34:27.499 region:rollup2
AN INTERESTING IDEA.

00:34:26.932 --> 00:34:29.401 region:rollup2
BUT HERE'S THE BACKGROUND TO

00:34:27.499 --> 00:34:30.735 region:rollup2
THIS.

00:34:29.401 --> 00:34:32.737 region:rollup2
CIGARETTE FILTERS ARE CIGARETTE

00:34:30.735 --> 00:34:34.105 region:rollup2
* ARE THE MOST UBIQUITOUS

00:34:32.737 --> 00:34:35.640 region:rollup2
ITEM THAT WE FIND A COSTA

00:34:34.105 --> 00:34:37.142 region:rollup2
CLEANUPS RIVER CLEANUPS PARK AND

00:34:35.640 --> 00:34:38.209 region:rollup2
EVERYWHERE.

00:34:37.142 --> 00:34:39.878 region:rollup2
JUST WALK THE GROUNDS THE

00:34:38.209 --> 00:34:41.746 region:rollup2
CAPITAL AND YOU SEE CIGARETTE

00:34:39.878 --> 00:34:43.615 region:rollup2
* ALL OVER.

00:34:41.746 --> 00:34:45.884 region:rollup2
IT'S SOMETHING THAT TENDS TO BE

00:34:43.615 --> 00:34:46.685 region:rollup2
VERY UBIQUITOUS WHEREVER WE GO

00:34:45.884 --> 00:34:48.019 region:rollup2
AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S

00:34:46.685 --> 00:34:49.621 region:rollup2
UNAVOIDABLE IT'S A SIGNIFICANT

00:34:48.019 --> 00:34:51.189 region:rollup2
LITTER PROBLEM.

00:34:49.621 --> 00:34:52.591 region:rollup2
AND AS WE'RE TRYING TO REDUCE

00:34:51.189 --> 00:34:53.992 region:rollup2
THE IMPACT OF PLASTICS IN OUR

00:34:52.591 --> 00:34:54.793 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENT

00:34:53.992 --> 00:34:56.861 region:rollup2
AND CIGARETTE FILTERS ARE

00:34:54.793 --> 00:34:58.330 region:rollup2
PLASTIC.

00:34:56.861 --> 00:34:59.864 region:rollup2
IT'S CELLULOSE ACETATE SO IT'S

00:34:58.330 --> 00:35:01.533 region:rollup2
PERVASIVE IN OUR ENVIRONMENT

00:34:59.864 --> 00:35:02.834 region:rollup2
DOES NOT BREAK DOWN.

00:35:01.533 --> 00:35:03.835 region:rollup2
IN ORDER TO REDUCE THE PLASTIC

00:35:02.834 --> 00:35:05.837 region:rollup2
THOUGHT WOULD BE AN INTERESTING

00:35:03.835 --> 00:35:07.939 region:rollup2
IDEA TO SEE HOW WE COULD REDUCE

00:35:05.837 --> 00:35:09.774 region:rollup2
THE IMPACT OF WHAT GETS TOSSED

00:35:07.939 --> 00:35:11.509 region:rollup2
INTO OUR ENVIRONMENT.

00:35:09.774 --> 00:35:13.244 region:rollup2
NOW MISTER CHAIR I WANNA THANK

00:35:11.509 --> 00:35:14.346 region:rollup2
YOU FOR THAT.

00:35:13.244 --> 00:35:15.647 region:rollup2
ANALYSIS HE WAS VERY THOROUGH IS

00:35:14.346 --> 00:35:17.115 region:rollup2
VERY LONG.

00:35:15.647 --> 00:35:19.317 region:rollup2
BUT IS ALSO VERY FAIR

00:35:17.115 --> 00:35:20.952 region:rollup2
CHARACTERIZATION OF. THE ISSUES

00:35:19.317 --> 00:35:22.220 region:rollup2
THAT WE REALLY FACE HERE BECAUSE

00:35:20.952 --> 00:35:23.955 region:rollup2
AS WE'VE TRIED TO TALK ABOUT

00:35:22.220 --> 00:35:26.725 region:rollup2
THIS BILL BEFORE.

00:35:23.955 --> 00:35:27.592 region:rollup2
WE GET LOST IN THE NOTION THAT

00:35:26.725 --> 00:35:29.394 region:rollup2
TAKING THE FILTER OFF A

00:35:27.592 --> 00:35:31.863 region:rollup2
CIGARETTE WOULD CREATE A MORE

00:35:29.394 --> 00:35:34.032 region:rollup2
DANGEROUS PRODUCT IN THE SCIENCE

00:35:31.863 --> 00:35:38.303 region:rollup2
SHOWS THAT THAT'S NOT TRUE.

00:35:34.032 --> 00:35:39.938 region:rollup2
WE GET KIND OF CAUGHT UP IN THE.

00:35:38.303 --> 00:35:42.140 region:rollup2
SO THAT THE MYTH THAT THE

00:35:39.938 --> 00:35:43.642 region:rollup2
CIGARETTE COMPANIES HAVE PUT ON

00:35:42.140 --> 00:35:44.876 region:rollup2
US OVER THE YEARS THAT ADDING

00:35:43.642 --> 00:35:46.411 region:rollup2
FILTERS WHICH WERE ADDED

00:35:44.876 --> 00:35:48.013 region:rollup2
STARTING IN THE FIFTIES AS THE

00:35:46.411 --> 00:35:50.749 region:rollup2
ANNOUNCES POINTS OUT.

00:35:48.013 --> 00:35:51.616 region:rollup2
ONCE CIGARETTES RULINGS TO LUNG

00:35:50.749 --> 00:35:52.484 region:rollup2
CANCER AND OTHER NEGATIVE HEALTH

00:35:51.616 --> 00:35:54.786 region:rollup2
EFFECTS.

00:35:52.484 --> 00:35:56.421 region:rollup2
AND.

00:35:54.786 --> 00:35:57.889 region:rollup2
SINCE THAT'S NO LONGER TRUE AND

00:35:56.421 --> 00:35:58.723 region:rollup2
SEND SMOKERS THAN SINCE I'VE

00:35:57.889 --> 00:36:00.125 region:rollup2
BEEN RUNNING THIS BILL I TALKED

00:35:58.723 --> 00:36:01.793 region:rollup2
TO A LOT OF SMOKERS BOTTOM DON'T

00:36:00.125 --> 00:36:03.561 region:rollup2
LIKE THIS AND I IDEA SOME OF

00:36:01.793 --> 00:36:05.330 region:rollup2
THEM DO LIKE THIS IDEA BUT ONE

00:36:03.561 --> 00:36:05.897 region:rollup2
OF THE COMMON THREADS.

00:36:05.330 --> 00:36:07.732 region:rollup2
AND THE CONVERSATION REALLY

00:36:05.897 --> 00:36:09.067 region:rollup2
STARTED WITH COULD WE GO TO A

00:36:07.732 --> 00:36:11.469 region:rollup2
REUSABLE FILTER COULD BE GO TO

00:36:09.067 --> 00:36:12.270 region:rollup2
SOME OTHER. ASPECT THAT WOULD

00:36:11.469 --> 00:36:14.172 region:rollup2
MAKE THE SMOKERS MORE

00:36:12.270 --> 00:36:14.773 region:rollup2
COMFORTABLE AND AGAIN AND AGAIN

00:36:14.172 --> 00:36:15.974 region:rollup2
AND AGAIN THEY SAY WE SMOKE.

00:36:14.773 --> 00:36:16.508 region:rollup2
WE TOSS

00:36:15.974 --> 00:36:18.710 region:rollup2
THE SMOKE.

00:36:16.508 --> 00:36:20.612 region:rollup2
WE TOSS.

00:36:18.710 --> 00:36:22.647 region:rollup2
SO WHY NOT TAKE THE STEP TO MAKE

00:36:20.612 --> 00:36:23.848 region:rollup2
WHAT GETS TOSSED.

00:36:22.647 --> 00:36:25.984 region:rollup2
A LESS ENVIRONMENTALLY HARMFUL

00:36:23.848 --> 00:36:26.584 region:rollup2
PRODUCT.

00:36:25.984 --> 00:36:28.153 region:rollup2
WE'RE NOT AFFECTING THE HEALTH

00:36:26.584 --> 00:36:29.120 region:rollup2
THE SMOKER.

00:36:28.153 --> 00:36:30.789 region:rollup2
AND THE AND THINK THAT THE

00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:31.990 region:rollup2
ANNOUNCES VERY CLEAR ON THAT AND

00:36:30.789 --> 00:36:34.125 region:rollup2
FRANKLY WHY THIS IS DOUBLE

00:36:31.990 --> 00:36:35.226 region:rollup2
REFERRED TO GEO AND THEN TO

00:36:34.125 --> 00:36:37.162 region:rollup2
HEALTH IS SOMETHING I DON'T

00:36:35.226 --> 00:36:39.197 region:rollup2
QUITE UNDERSTAND. DATA RESOURCES

00:36:37.162 --> 00:36:40.965 region:rollup2
MAYBE AND AS THE ANNOUNCES

00:36:39.197 --> 00:36:42.434 region:rollup2
POINTS OUT TO POTENTIALLY RATHER

00:36:40.965 --> 00:36:43.568 region:rollup2
TAX BECAUSE THERE'S CLEARLY SOME

00:36:42.434 --> 00:36:44.869 region:rollup2
ISSUES THAT THAT NEED TO BE

00:36:43.568 --> 00:36:46.604 region:rollup2
ADDRESSED IN THEIR.

00:36:44.869 --> 00:36:47.872 region:rollup2
BUT THE HEALTH ISSUES ARE NOT

00:36:46.604 --> 00:36:49.641 region:rollup2
REALLY A PART OF WHAT THIS BILL

00:36:47.872 --> 00:36:51.509 region:rollup2
IS TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH. NOR ARE

00:36:49.641 --> 00:36:53.812 region:rollup2
THEY SOMETHING THAT.

00:36:51.509 --> 00:36:55.914 region:rollup2
GETS PREVENTED BY WHAT WE'RE

00:36:53.812 --> 00:36:56.548 region:rollup2
TRYING TO TO ACCOMPLISH HERE AND

00:36:55.914 --> 00:36:57.882 region:rollup2
WE DO HAVE SOME TESTIMONY ABOUT

00:36:56.548 --> 00:36:58.883 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:36:57.882 --> 00:37:00.819 region:rollup2
SO LET'S CUT TO DRILL DOWN AT

00:36:58.883 --> 00:37:02.454 region:rollup2
THE IMPACT.

00:37:00.819 --> 00:37:04.322 region:rollup2
SEE IF THEIR CISCO TELLS US THAT

00:37:02.454 --> 00:37:04.956 region:rollup2
THEY SPEND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS A

00:37:04.322 --> 00:37:06.057 region:rollup2
YEAR JUST CLEANING UP CIGARETTE

00:37:04.956 --> 00:37:07.992 region:rollup2
*.

00:37:06.057 --> 00:37:09.160 region:rollup2
CALTRANS TELLS US FORTY THREE

00:37:07.992 --> 00:37:11.463 region:rollup2
MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR JUST

00:37:09.160 --> 00:37:13.231 region:rollup2
CLEANING UP CIGARETTE*.

00:37:11.463 --> 00:37:13.865 region:rollup2
CITIES AND COUNTIES WHEN THEY'RE

00:37:13.231 --> 00:37:15.233 region:rollup2
DEALING WITH STORM WATER RUNOFF

00:37:13.865 --> 00:37:16.868 region:rollup2
NOW.

00:37:15.233 --> 00:37:18.336 region:rollup2
ARE FACED WITH A SITUATION THAT

00:37:16.868 --> 00:37:19.971 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE TO GET PERMITTED AND

00:37:18.336 --> 00:37:21.406 region:rollup2
SPEND MONEY ON CLEANING UP THAT

00:37:19.971 --> 00:37:23.174 region:rollup2
STORM WATER.

00:37:21.406 --> 00:37:24.909 region:rollup2
IF THERE WERE NO CIGARETTE.

00:37:23.174 --> 00:37:26.644 region:rollup2
BUT CIGARETTE FILTERS.

00:37:24.909 --> 00:37:28.613 region:rollup2
IN THAT RUNOFF

00:37:26.644 --> 00:37:30.081 region:rollup2
THEN THERE TASK WOULD BE EASIER

00:37:28.613 --> 00:37:31.449 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE FILTERING THAT THEY

00:37:30.081 --> 00:37:33.384 region:rollup2
WOULD HAVE TO DO WOULD BE LESS

00:37:31.449 --> 00:37:34.552 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT.

00:37:33.384 --> 00:37:35.520 region:rollup2
AND THEY'RE THE ONES CARRYING

00:37:34.552 --> 00:37:37.455 region:rollup2
THE BRUNT OF PICKING UP THE

00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:39.424 region:rollup2
CIGARETTE*.

00:37:37.455 --> 00:37:42.293 region:rollup2
NOW I KNOW THE QUESTION ABOUT

00:37:39.424 --> 00:37:43.895 region:rollup2
LATER IS ALSO PREVALENT ONE AND

00:37:42.293 --> 00:37:45.730 region:rollup2
WHY DON'T WE JUST GO AFTER.

00:37:43.895 --> 00:37:47.031 region:rollup2
LETTER AND REYES THAT THE

00:37:45.730 --> 00:37:48.366 region:rollup2
PENALTIES FOR THAT. WELL

00:37:47.031 --> 00:37:49.567 region:rollup2
PENALTIES FOR LITTERING THROWING

00:37:48.366 --> 00:37:50.969 region:rollup2
A CIGARETTE OUT OF A CAR WE'VE

00:37:49.567 --> 00:37:52.904 region:rollup2
ALL SEEN IT SPECS IN THE

00:37:50.969 --> 00:37:54.606 region:rollup2
TWILIGHT THAT ORANGE RQ SOMEBODY

00:37:52.904 --> 00:37:56.274 region:rollup2
SMOKES TOSSED THE CIGARETTE OUT.

00:37:54.606 --> 00:37:58.276 region:rollup2
OR ON THE GROUNDS THE CAPITAL OR

00:37:56.274 --> 00:37:59.377 region:rollup2
ON A BEACH. THEIR FINES UP TO A

00:37:58.276 --> 00:38:01.479 region:rollup2
THOUSAND DOLLARS.

00:37:59.377 --> 00:38:03.081 region:rollup2
DO WE RAISE THAT TO TEN.

00:38:01.479 --> 00:38:04.749 region:rollup2
TO RESET THE FIVE I'M NOT SURE

00:38:03.081 --> 00:38:06.518 region:rollup2
THAT'S THE RIGHT WAY TO GO.

00:38:04.749 --> 00:38:07.452 region:rollup2
AND AGAIN SMOKERS TELL ME AGAIN

00:38:06.518 --> 00:38:09.420 region:rollup2
AND AGAIN AND AGAIN THEY SMOKE.

00:38:07.452 --> 00:38:11.022 region:rollup2
AND THEY TOSS

00:38:09.420 --> 00:38:12.857 region:rollup2
SO I DON'T KNOW THAT WE CAN

00:38:11.022 --> 00:38:14.058 region:rollup2
CHANGE THAT BEHAVIOR I DON'T

00:38:12.857 --> 00:38:15.527 region:rollup2
KNOW THAT WE CAN UP THE PENALTY

00:38:14.058 --> 00:38:16.861 region:rollup2
SO MUCH.

00:38:15.527 --> 00:38:17.829 region:rollup2
THAT IT PROVIDES ADDITIONAL

00:38:16.861 --> 00:38:18.830 region:rollup2
BARRIERS THAT BECOMES A REAL

00:38:17.829 --> 00:38:20.131 region:rollup2
CHALLENGE.

00:38:18.830 --> 00:38:22.133 region:rollup2
SO.

00:38:20.131 --> 00:38:22.967 region:rollup2
FOR THIS BILL.

00:38:22.133 --> 00:38:25.136 region:rollup2
CHANGING THE PRODUCT

00:38:22.967 --> 00:38:27.438 region:rollup2
SLIGHTLY

00:38:25.136 --> 00:38:29.007 region:rollup2
AND IT'S NOT A SILLY AFFECTING

00:38:27.438 --> 00:38:30.041 region:rollup2
THE PRODUCT ITSELF BECAUSE MOST

00:38:29.007 --> 00:38:30.675 region:rollup2
CIGARETTE COMPANIES DO HAVE

00:38:30.041 --> 00:38:32.610 region:rollup2
FILLED WITH THE CIGARETTES THAT

00:38:30.675 --> 00:38:33.912 region:rollup2
THEY OFFER.

00:38:32.610 --> 00:38:35.246 region:rollup2
DOES EXIST BACK THAT'S BREWING

00:38:33.912 --> 00:38:36.981 region:rollup2
ALL THAT WAS THERE PRIOR TO THE

00:38:35.246 --> 00:38:38.950 region:rollup2
NINETEEN FIFTIES.

00:38:36.981 --> 00:38:40.885 region:rollup2
WHEN I GO BACK TO THOSE DAYS.

00:38:38.950 --> 00:38:41.352 region:rollup2
AND HAVE A PRODUCT AND THAT IS

00:38:40.885 --> 00:38:43.688 region:rollup2
THE DOES NOT CARRY THE

00:38:41.352 --> 00:38:44.422 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENTAL COST.

00:38:43.688 --> 00:38:45.857 region:rollup2
SO SOME OF THE YOU KNOW HAS

00:38:44.422 --> 00:38:48.126 region:rollup2
RAISES SOME ISSUES AS WELL MIKE

00:38:45.857 --> 00:38:49.160 region:rollup2
THOUGH FEDERAL PREEMPTION.

00:38:48.126 --> 00:38:50.695 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE FDA HAS BEEN VERY

00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:52.230 region:rollup2
CLEAR. THAT THEY REGULATE

00:38:50.695 --> 00:38:53.064 region:rollup2
CIGARETTES

00:38:52.230 --> 00:38:53.832 region:rollup2
BUT WHAT THEY REGULATORS THE

00:38:53.064 --> 00:38:55.700 region:rollup2
CONSTRUCTION.

00:38:53.832 --> 00:38:57.101 region:rollup2
OF CIGARETTES

00:38:55.700 --> 00:38:59.170 region:rollup2
NOT NECESSARILY THE CIGARETTE

00:38:57.101 --> 00:39:00.471 region:rollup2
ITSELF IS VERY CLEAR IN LAW.

00:38:59.170 --> 00:39:01.239 region:rollup2
AND THE CITY OF NEW YORK FOR

00:39:00.471 --> 00:39:02.841 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE HAS BANNED FLAVORED

00:39:01.239 --> 00:39:04.209 region:rollup2
CIGARETTES.

00:39:02.841 --> 00:39:05.610 region:rollup2
TO ME THAT GOES A LITTLE BIT

00:39:04.209 --> 00:39:06.778 region:rollup2
CLOSER TO THIS NOTION OF

00:39:05.610 --> 00:39:08.112 region:rollup2
CONSTRUCTION SINCE IT'S DECEIVE

00:39:06.778 --> 00:39:09.113 region:rollup2
NEW YORK TELLING THE CIGARETTE

00:39:08.112 --> 00:39:11.249 region:rollup2
COMPANIES WHAT CAN BE IN THEIR

00:39:09.113 --> 00:39:12.483 region:rollup2
PRODUCTS.

00:39:11.249 --> 00:39:14.519 region:rollup2
AND THAT PASSED THE TEST IN FACT

00:39:12.483 --> 00:39:16.221 region:rollup2
THIS THE FIRST AND SECOND.

00:39:14.519 --> 00:39:17.222 region:rollup2
CIRCUIT COURTS THOUGH ON THE

00:39:16.221 --> 00:39:18.656 region:rollup2
EAST COAST WHICH TEND O BE THE

00:39:17.222 --> 00:39:20.625 region:rollup2
ONE TO HEAR CIGARETTE CASES

00:39:18.656 --> 00:39:21.993 region:rollup2
AGREED. AND HAVE BEEN VERY CLEAR

00:39:20.625 --> 00:39:24.262 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:39:21.993 --> 00:39:25.630 region:rollup2
STATES AND COUNTIES CAN IN FACT

00:39:24.262 --> 00:39:27.432 region:rollup2
BAN CIGARETTES WERE BANNED

00:39:25.630 --> 00:39:28.933 region:rollup2
CERTAIN TYPES OF CIGARETTES

00:39:27.432 --> 00:39:31.402 region:rollup2
SO I THINK THIS BILL WOULD VERY

00:39:28.933 --> 00:39:32.904 region:rollup2
CLEARLY. NOT BE PREEMPTED

00:39:31.402 --> 00:39:34.772 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE'RE JUST SAYING FILTER

00:39:32.904 --> 00:39:36.207 region:rollup2
THE CIGARETTES WOULD BE OKAY IN

00:39:34.772 --> 00:39:38.076 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA FILTERED CIGARETTES

00:39:36.207 --> 00:39:39.777 region:rollup2
WOULD NOT BE.

00:39:38.076 --> 00:39:41.212 region:rollup2
SO THAT I A TRIPS IS PROBABLY

00:39:39.777 --> 00:39:42.347 region:rollup2
NOT A PROBLEM ONE OF THE

00:39:41.212 --> 00:39:44.849 region:rollup2
SUGGESTIONS AS WHY DON'T WE

00:39:42.347 --> 00:39:46.184 region:rollup2
REQUIRE BIODEGRADABLE FILTERS.

00:39:44.849 --> 00:39:48.920 region:rollup2
WELL INTERESTING THOUGHT

00:39:46.184 --> 00:39:50.688 region:rollup2
ALTHOUGH OF THE TWO IDEAS

00:39:48.920 --> 00:39:52.123 region:rollup2
BANNING FILTERED CIGARETTES WAR

00:39:50.688 --> 00:39:53.491 region:rollup2
REQUIRE BIODEGRADABLE FILTERS

00:39:52.123 --> 00:39:54.926 region:rollup2
THE BIODEGRADABLE FILTERS NOW

00:39:53.491 --> 00:39:56.461 region:rollup2
GOES MORE TO THE CONSTRUCTION.

00:39:54.926 --> 00:39:57.028 region:rollup2
OF THE CIGARETTE.

00:39:56.461 --> 00:39:58.963 region:rollup2
THAT IS MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO

00:39:57.028 --> 00:40:01.432 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:39:58.963 --> 00:40:03.067 region:rollup2
PREEMPTION ARGUMENT BUT JUST BE

00:40:01.432 --> 00:40:05.069 region:rollup2
ENDING A FILTERED CIGARETTE.

00:40:03.067 --> 00:40:06.771 region:rollup2
REALLY DOES NOT.

00:40:05.069 --> 00:40:08.907 region:rollup2
ALSO BE ANNOUNCES POINTS OUT THE

00:40:06.771 --> 00:40:10.375 region:rollup2
TAXATION ISSUES AND THE YEAR THE

00:40:08.907 --> 00:40:11.476 region:rollup2
REVENUE ISSUES AND THE PIRACY

00:40:10.375 --> 00:40:12.877 region:rollup2
ISSUES IN THE PIRACY ISSUE I

00:40:11.476 --> 00:40:13.444 region:rollup2
THINK IS SOMETHING THAT'S THAT'S

00:40:12.877 --> 00:40:14.779 region:rollup2
VERY SIGNIFICANT WE'VE BEEN

00:40:13.444 --> 00:40:16.014 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT THAT.

00:40:14.779 --> 00:40:17.782 region:rollup2
WE TALKED TO FIT THE FRANCHISE

00:40:16.014 --> 00:40:19.250 region:rollup2
TAX BOARD SEVERAL YEARS AGO WE

00:40:17.782 --> 00:40:21.686 region:rollup2
FIRST BROUGHT UP THIS IDEA. THEY

00:40:19.250 --> 00:40:23.554 region:rollup2
DID SAY THAT AS THE STATE PASSES

00:40:21.686 --> 00:40:25.356 region:rollup2
LAWS LIKE THIS WE WILL SEE A

00:40:23.554 --> 00:40:26.257 region:rollup2
SPIKE IN IN PIRACY.

00:40:25.356 --> 00:40:28.026 region:rollup2
BUT IT TAILS OFF AS PEOPLE GET

00:40:26.257 --> 00:40:30.395 region:rollup2
USED TO IT.

00:40:28.026 --> 00:40:32.096 region:rollup2
THE THIRTY PERCENT NUMBER OF.

00:40:30.395 --> 00:40:33.097 region:rollup2
PIRATED CIGARETTES IN CALIFORNIA

00:40:32.096 --> 00:40:34.532 region:rollup2
IS PROBABLY DRIVEN MORE BY THE

00:40:33.097 --> 00:40:36.501 region:rollup2
TWO DOLLARS.

00:40:34.532 --> 00:40:37.702 region:rollup2
A PACK TAX THAT WE PUT IN PLACE

00:40:36.501 --> 00:40:39.304 region:rollup2
THIS BODY PUT IN PLACE A COUPLE

00:40:37.702 --> 00:40:41.039 region:rollup2
OF YEARS AGO IT WENT FROM EIGHTY

00:40:39.304 --> 00:40:41.639 region:rollup2
SEVEN CENTS A PACK.

00:40:41.039 --> 00:40:42.740 region:rollup2
A TWO DOLLARS AND EIGHTY SEVEN

00:40:41.639 --> 00:40:43.941 region:rollup2
CENTS A PACK

00:40:42.740 --> 00:40:45.910 region:rollup2
THAT'S PROBABLY THE MOST

00:40:43.941 --> 00:40:47.979 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT DRIVER OF PIRACY IN

00:40:45.910 --> 00:40:51.316 region:rollup2
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

00:40:47.979 --> 00:40:52.950 region:rollup2
IF THIS BILL WERE TO PASS.

00:40:51.316 --> 00:40:54.752 region:rollup2
WOULD THAT IMPACT PIRACY IN

00:40:52.950 --> 00:40:55.687 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA PERHAPS

00:40:54.752 --> 00:40:56.788 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK IT'S A LITTLE BIT

00:40:55.687 --> 00:40:58.323 region:rollup2
SPECULATIVE TO SAY HOW MUCH

00:40:56.788 --> 00:40:59.290 region:rollup2
SENATE'S IT'S CERTAINLY WORTH

00:40:58.323 --> 00:41:01.659 region:rollup2
STUDYING IT'S WORTH TAKING A

00:40:59.290 --> 00:41:02.694 region:rollup2
LOOK AT. WHAT WHETHER NOT THIS

00:41:01.659 --> 00:41:04.562 region:rollup2
WOULD REALLY DRIVE PIRACY OR

00:41:02.694 --> 00:41:06.030 region:rollup2
WAYS AROUND IT?

00:41:04.562 --> 00:41:07.265 region:rollup2
NOW I'VE BEEN HEARING ALSO FROM

00:41:06.030 --> 00:41:08.700 region:rollup2
I LOCAL RETAILERS AND I KNOW

00:41:07.265 --> 00:41:10.234 region:rollup2
WE'LL BE HEARING FROM SOME OF

00:41:08.700 --> 00:41:11.102 region:rollup2
THEM TODAY BECAUSE A LOT OF WHAT

00:41:10.234 --> 00:41:13.104 region:rollup2
WE DO IN SACRAMENTO DOES AFFECT

00:41:11.102 --> 00:41:13.838 region:rollup2
THE RETAILERS.

00:41:13.104 --> 00:41:15.673 region:rollup2
BUT TO THE RETAILERS AND HOW

00:41:13.838 --> 00:41:17.342 region:rollup2
EXPLAINED IT.

00:41:15.673 --> 00:41:19.344 region:rollup2
FOR THEM THE ONCE OF CONTACTED

00:41:17.342 --> 00:41:20.778 region:rollup2
ME IN MY IN MY DISTRICT.

00:41:19.344 --> 00:41:22.580 region:rollup2
THEY WOULD BE GETTING A SUPPLY

00:41:20.778 --> 00:41:24.182 region:rollup2
IF THIS WERE TO BE PUT IN PLACE.

00:41:22.580 --> 00:41:25.983 region:rollup2
OF NON FILTERED CIGARETTES THAT

00:41:24.182 --> 00:41:28.119 region:rollup2
THEY COULD THEN SO INTO THEIR

00:41:25.983 --> 00:41:29.354 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES SO THEIR SUPPLY

00:41:28.119 --> 00:41:30.755 region:rollup2
THEIR ABILITY TO KEEP THEIR

00:41:29.354 --> 00:41:32.256 region:rollup2
BUSINESS AND SELL CIGARETTES

00:41:30.755 --> 00:41:33.558 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE UNINTERRUPTED.

00:41:32.256 --> 00:41:34.659 region:rollup2
AND IF WE WANTED TO BUILD IN

00:41:33.558 --> 00:41:36.594 region:rollup2
SOME BUFFER SO THAT THEY CAN

00:41:34.659 --> 00:41:38.363 region:rollup2
SELL DOWN THEIR STOCK THAT WE

00:41:36.594 --> 00:41:39.931 region:rollup2
COULD FACE THIS AND. THAT'S THAT

00:41:38.363 --> 00:41:41.699 region:rollup2
WOULD BE FINE WITH ME BECAUSE I

00:41:39.931 --> 00:41:42.767 region:rollup2
DON'T NECESSARILY.

00:41:41.699 --> 00:41:44.602 region:rollup2
PART OF ME WOULD CERTAINLY LIKE

00:41:42.767 --> 00:41:46.304 region:rollup2
TO NOT BE SELLING CIGARETTES IN

00:41:44.602 --> 00:41:47.171 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA BUT IF WE HAVE

00:41:46.304 --> 00:41:49.006 region:rollup2
BUSINESSES THAT ARE BUILT AROUND

00:41:47.171 --> 00:41:50.908 region:rollup2
THAT THEN THIS BILL IS NOT

00:41:49.006 --> 00:41:52.443 region:rollup2
INTENDED TO INTERRUPT THAT. THIS

00:41:50.908 --> 00:41:54.278 region:rollup2
BILL IS REALLY INTENDED TO TAKE.

00:41:52.443 --> 00:41:57.181 region:rollup2
THAT

00:41:54.278 --> 00:41:58.983 region:rollup2
FILTER OUT OF OUR CIRCULATION

00:41:57.181 --> 00:42:01.085 region:rollup2
THAT'S REALLY THE GOAL SO FROM

00:41:58.983 --> 00:42:01.619 region:rollup2
WATER QUALITY STANDPOINT.

00:42:01.085 --> 00:42:03.021 region:rollup2
FROM A LOCAL JURISDICTIONS

00:42:01.619 --> 00:42:05.023 region:rollup2
STANDPOINT.

00:42:03.021 --> 00:42:06.324 region:rollup2
CLEAN UP THAT WE ALL HAVE TO DO.

00:42:05.023 --> 00:42:07.692 region:rollup2
TRY TO FIND WAYS TO ADDRESS THE

00:42:06.324 --> 00:42:09.193 region:rollup2
CONCERNS OF SMALL BUSINESS AND

00:42:07.692 --> 00:42:11.195 region:rollup2
PIRACY AND IN FACT I THINK THE

00:42:09.193 --> 00:42:12.530 region:rollup2
SMALL BUSINESSES. WOULD.

00:42:11.195 --> 00:42:13.798 region:rollup2
WHICH SHOULD BE BETTER SERVED IF

00:42:12.530 --> 00:42:15.633 region:rollup2
WE WOULD FIND SOME WAYS TO

00:42:13.798 --> 00:42:17.402 region:rollup2
ADDRESS THAT PIRACY.

00:42:15.633 --> 00:42:19.370 region:rollup2
THEY'RE THE ONES BEING HURT MOST

00:42:17.402 --> 00:42:20.405 region:rollup2
DIRECTLY BY THAT THIRTY PERCENT

00:42:19.370 --> 00:42:22.273 region:rollup2
CIGARETTES COMING THE STATE OF

00:42:20.405 --> 00:42:23.141 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA FROM OUTSIDE. THOSE

00:42:22.273 --> 00:42:24.642 region:rollup2
SMALL BUSINESSES ARE LOSING

00:42:23.141 --> 00:42:25.676 region:rollup2
THEIR SALES.

00:42:24.642 --> 00:42:26.878 region:rollup2
SO WE SHOULD BE ADDRESSING

00:42:25.676 --> 00:42:28.413 region:rollup2
PIRACY WE SHOULD BE TAKING A

00:42:26.878 --> 00:42:29.947 region:rollup2
MUCH HARDER LOOK AT THAT.

00:42:28.413 --> 00:42:31.082 region:rollup2
AND ON THE REVENUE SIDE AND THEY

00:42:29.947 --> 00:42:32.550 region:rollup2
KNOW THAT WOULD THAT WAS ALSO

00:42:31.082 --> 00:42:33.885 region:rollup2
BROUGHT UP BY THE ANNOUNCES. BUT

00:42:32.550 --> 00:42:36.053 region:rollup2
THE WHOLE REVENUE FROM

00:42:33.885 --> 00:42:37.955 region:rollup2
CIGARETTES IN CALIFORNIA IS HAS

00:42:36.053 --> 00:42:39.023 region:rollup2
BEEN ON A DECLINING BASIS ANYWAY

00:42:37.955 --> 00:42:40.658 region:rollup2
WE ARE SEEING UNFORTUNATELY

00:42:39.023 --> 00:42:43.027 region:rollup2
OPTICS IN VAPING UPTAKES IN

00:42:40.658 --> 00:42:43.661 region:rollup2
OTHER. DELIVERY SYSTEMSBUT

00:42:43.027 --> 00:42:44.862 region:rollup2
CIGARETTES ARE KIND OF GOING OUT

00:42:43.661 --> 00:42:46.597 region:rollup2
OF FASHION.

00:42:44.862 --> 00:42:48.1000 region:rollup2
ADULTS FRANKLY A LOT OF FOLKS IN

00:42:46.597 --> 00:42:50.301 region:rollup2
MY GENERATION. WHO ARE STILL

00:42:48.1000 --> 00:42:51.068 region:rollup2
SMOKING SMOKING IS LESS THAN

00:42:50.301 --> 00:42:52.070 region:rollup2
TWELVE PERCENT OF THE POPULATION

00:42:51.068 --> 00:42:54.672 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA?

00:42:52.070 --> 00:42:55.907 region:rollup2
WHICH.

00:42:54.672 --> 00:42:56.507 region:rollup2
SHOULD RAISE THE QUESTION IF

00:42:55.907 --> 00:42:58.009 region:rollup2
IT'S LESS THAN TWELVE PERCENT

00:42:56.507 --> 00:42:59.644 region:rollup2
POPULATION WHY SO MUCH CIGARETTE

00:42:58.009 --> 00:43:01.312 region:rollup2
WASTE.

00:42:59.644 --> 00:43:03.081 region:rollup2
WELL AGAIN IT'S A DEDICATED

00:43:01.312 --> 00:43:03.614 region:rollup2
GROUP IT'S A GROUP THAT'S

00:43:03.081 --> 00:43:04.615 region:rollup2
PROBABLY NOT GOING TO STOP

00:43:03.614 --> 00:43:07.318 region:rollup2
SMOKING IT'S A GROUP THAT

00:43:04.615 --> 00:43:09.020 region:rollup2
PROBABLY WOULD. SWITCH TO FILTER

00:43:07.318 --> 00:43:12.090 region:rollup2
THE CIGARETTES IF NECESSARY.

00:43:09.020 --> 00:43:14.225 region:rollup2
THEY'RE STILL SMOKING.

00:43:12.090 --> 00:43:14.725 region:rollup2
THEY SHOULD BE A PART OF.

00:43:14.225 --> 00:43:17.562 region:rollup2
THE SOLUTION THAT WE'RE

00:43:14.725 --> 00:43:18.896 region:rollup2
PROPOSING AND I I WILL HAVE TO

00:43:17.562 --> 00:43:20.665 region:rollup2
ADMIT THAT IN TALKING SOME THE

00:43:18.896 --> 00:43:21.833 region:rollup2
SMOKERS. WHO ARE A LITTLE BIT

00:43:20.665 --> 00:43:23.334 region:rollup2
LEERY OF TAKING THE FILTERS OFF

00:43:21.833 --> 00:43:25.269 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE CHANGE THE TASTE?

00:43:23.334 --> 00:43:26.337 region:rollup2
IT WOULD CHANGE THE MOUTH FEEL.

00:43:25.269 --> 00:43:27.505 region:rollup2
CHANGE THAT SMOKE A LITTLE BIT

00:43:26.337 --> 00:43:28.706 region:rollup2
OF BUT IT BILL BUT OF THE

00:43:27.505 --> 00:43:30.441 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE BUT THAT'S THE

00:43:28.706 --> 00:43:32.176 region:rollup2
TRADEOFF VERSUS THE SIGNIFICANT

00:43:30.441 --> 00:43:33.411 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENTAL HARM.

00:43:32.176 --> 00:43:35.279 region:rollup2
NO TRADE OFTEN HARM TO THE

00:43:33.411 --> 00:43:36.881 region:rollup2
SMOKER THEMSELVES.

00:43:35.279 --> 00:43:38.649 region:rollup2
A LITTLE BIT OF INCONVENIENCE

00:43:36.881 --> 00:43:40.051 region:rollup2
WITH THE TASTE THE MOUTH FEEL

00:43:38.649 --> 00:43:42.019 region:rollup2
AND ALL THAT OF THIS MONTH.

00:43:40.051 --> 00:43:43.321 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT.

00:43:42.019 --> 00:43:44.522 region:rollup2
THE SCIENCE IS ACTUALLY THERE

00:43:43.321 --> 00:43:45.756 region:rollup2
SITES ESTABLISHES THIS IS A GOOD

00:43:44.522 --> 00:43:49.060 region:rollup2
IDEA.

00:43:45.756 --> 00:43:51.295 region:rollup2
SO FOR US THE QUESTION IS. IS

00:43:49.060 --> 00:43:52.797 region:rollup2
ARE THE OTHER ATTRIBUTES.

00:43:51.295 --> 00:43:54.599 region:rollup2
ENOUGH FOR US TO SAY WE

00:43:52.797 --> 00:43:56.234 region:rollup2
SHOULDN'T BE FACING THIS POLICY.

00:43:54.599 --> 00:43:58.069 region:rollup2
I THINK THE ANALYSIS SHOWS A

00:43:56.234 --> 00:44:00.271 region:rollup2
PATH.

00:43:58.069 --> 00:44:02.240 region:rollup2
FOR HAVING THIS CONVERSATION

00:44:00.271 --> 00:44:04.242 region:rollup2
GETTING OVER THE FEW YEARS

00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:05.576 region:rollup2
AROUND THE HEALTH OF THE SMOKER

00:44:04.242 --> 00:44:07.311 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE FILTER DOESN'T

00:44:05.576 --> 00:44:09.313 region:rollup2
REALLY DO ANYTHING AND THAT IN.

00:44:07.311 --> 00:44:10.314 region:rollup2
IN THAT RESPECT.

00:44:09.313 --> 00:44:11.883 region:rollup2
BUT REALLY LOOKING AT THE

00:44:10.314 --> 00:44:13.050 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENTAL HARM.

00:44:11.883 --> 00:44:13.417 region:rollup2
AND KNOWING THAT THE SMOKERS

00:44:13.050 --> 00:44:15.253 region:rollup2
GOING TO SMOKE.

00:44:13.417 --> 00:44:17.655 region:rollup2
AND TOSS

00:44:15.253 --> 00:44:18.122 region:rollup2
LET'S MUCH MAKE WHAT THEY TOSS

00:44:17.655 --> 00:44:19.123 region:rollup2
LESS IMPACTFUL ON THE

00:44:18.122 --> 00:44:21.225 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENT.

00:44:19.123 --> 00:44:22.860 region:rollup2
AND I ASKED WE ARRIVE AT.

00:44:21.225 --> 00:44:24.695 region:rollup2

LEVEL TO TRY AND INTRODUCED THIS

00:44:33.304 --> 00:44:36.741 region:rollup2
CONCEPT OF GETTING THIS FILTERED

00:44:34.972 --> 00:44:39.544 region:rollup2
THIS.

00:44:36.741 --> 00:44:41.145 region:rollup2
UNPRODUCTIVE BUT DAMAGING PIECE

00:44:39.544 --> 00:44:43.681 region:rollup2

LIGHT LOW ARE MILD. WHICH LED TO

00:45:15.513 --> 00:45:18.149 region:rollup2
CONSUMERS FALSELY BELIEVING THAT

00:45:16.914 --> 00:45:20.218 region:rollup2
THE CIGARETTE PRODUCTS WERE LESS

00:45:18.149 --> 00:45:21.252 region:rollup2
HARMFUL TO THEIR HEALTH THAN

00:45:20.218 --> 00:45:22.420 region:rollup2
SMOKING REGULAR CIGARETTES.

BY THE SURGEON GENERAL STRONGLY

00:45:37.435 --> 00:45:39.503 region:rollup2
SUGGEST THAT THE MODIFICATIONS

00:45:39.003 --> 00:45:41.439 region:rollup2
TO THE CIGARETTE DESIGN

00:45:39.503 --> 00:45:42.773 region:rollup2
INCLUDED.

RISKS OF CERTAIN TYPE OF CANCERS

00:45:50.348 --> 00:45:51.616 region:rollup2

00:45:50.948 --> 00:45:52.883 region:rollup2
THEM.

00:45:51.616 --> 00:45:54.218 region:rollup2
AND WE EXPECT THAT THE PASSAGE

00:45:52.883 --> 00:45:55.686 region:rollup2
OF THIS MEASURE WOULD LEAD TO A

00:45:54.218 --> 00:45:56.887 region:rollup2
DECREASE RISK IN THE NECK AND

I JUST WANT TO.

00:46:33.924 --> 00:46:39.230 region:rollup2
FURTHER DISPEL THE NOTION THAT

00:46:37.028 --> 00:46:40.665 region:rollup2
THE THE CIGARETTE FILTER HAS ANY

00:46:39.230 --> 00:46:42.366 region:rollup2
HEALTH BENEFIT IN FACT ISSUES

00:46:40.665 --> 00:46:44.402 region:rollup2
POINTED OUT JUST NOW.

00:46:42.366 --> 00:46:46.637 region:rollup2
THEIR USE OF THE FILTER MEANS

00:46:44.402 --> 00:46:48.272 region:rollup2
EUROPE YOU'RE INHALING AGAINST

00:46:46.637 --> 00:46:49.674 region:rollup2
AND OBSTRUCTION MEANS YOU INHALE

00:46:48.272 --> 00:46:51.876 region:rollup2
THE SMOKE MORE DEEPLY INTO YOUR

00:46:49.674 --> 00:46:53.444 region:rollup2
LUNGS. AND THAT MEANS THAT IT'S

00:46:51.876 --> 00:46:54.879 region:rollup2
CHANGE THE CELL TYPE OF THE LUNG

00:46:53.444 --> 00:46:56.013 region:rollup2
CANCER THAT IT IS CAUSED BY

00:46:54.879 --> 00:46:58.416 region:rollup2
CIGARETTE SMOKING FROM SMALL

00:46:56.013 --> 00:47:00.484 region:rollup2
CELL TO MY MORE AGGRESSIVE TYPE

00:46:58.416 --> 00:47:02.186 region:rollup2
OF CANCER CALLED ADENOCARCINOMA.

00:47:00.484 --> 00:47:03.754 region:rollup2
THE RISKS FOR SMOKING THE RISK

00:47:02.186 --> 00:47:05.690 region:rollup2
FOR LUNG CANCER RATHER HAVE GONE

00:47:03.754 --> 00:47:07.291 region:rollup2
UP ACTUALLY OVER THE LAST FIFTY

00:47:05.690 --> 00:47:08.726 region:rollup2
OR SIXTY YEARS SINCE THE ENGINE

00:47:07.291 --> 00:47:09.760 region:rollup2
AT THE INTRODUCTION OF THIS

00:47:08.726 --> 00:47:12.096 region:rollup2
FRAUDULENT.

00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:13.931 region:rollup2
ATTEMPT TO MAKE A CIGARETTE

00:47:12.096 --> 00:47:14.699 region:rollup2
SAFER IT JUST DOESN'T WORK.

00:47:13.931 --> 00:47:16.400 region:rollup2
NOW THE.

00:47:14.699 --> 00:47:18.035 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES IS PRETTY

00:47:16.400 --> 00:47:20.705 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT AS A AS A.

00:47:18.035 --> 00:47:22.173 region:rollup2
MISS STONE'S POINTED OUT THERE

00:47:20.705 --> 00:47:24.308 region:rollup2
SEVENTEEN BILLION CIGARETTES

00:47:22.173 --> 00:47:26.043 region:rollup2
SOLD YEARLY IN CALIFORNIA STILL

00:47:24.308 --> 00:47:27.778 region:rollup2
EVERY YEAR SEVENTY BILLION GET

00:47:26.043 --> 00:47:29.080 region:rollup2
DUMPED SOMEWHERE THAT'S WHY IT

00:47:27.778 --> 00:47:30.815 region:rollup2
IS THE MOST COMMON THING PICKED

00:47:29.080 --> 00:47:32.817 region:rollup2
UP ON BEACHES IN URBAN CLEAN UPS

00:47:30.815 --> 00:47:34.185 region:rollup2
THROUGHOUT THIS STATE BUT ALSO

00:47:32.817 --> 00:47:35.052 region:rollup2
THROUGHOUT THE WORLD OVER THE

00:47:34.185 --> 00:47:36.320 region:rollup2
LAST THIRTY OR FORTY YEARS.

00:47:35.052 --> 00:47:38.289 region:rollup2
WE'VE DONE DONE THE SITE

00:47:36.320 --> 00:47:39.423 region:rollup2
CLEANUPS NON BIODEGRADABLE

00:47:38.289 --> 00:47:41.125 region:rollup2
PLASTIC.

00:47:39.423 --> 00:47:42.993 region:rollup2
I IN THE REST OF THE CIGARETTE

00:47:41.125 --> 00:47:44.729 region:rollup2
IS BIODEGRADABLE SO THAT WITHOUT

00:47:42.993 --> 00:47:46.530 region:rollup2
IT ONE WOULD THINK IT YOU WOULD

00:47:44.729 --> 00:47:47.531 region:rollup2
HAVE MUCH LESS OF A.

00:47:46.530 --> 00:47:49.367 region:rollup2
INSULT TO THE ENVIRONMENT BY

00:47:47.531 --> 00:47:51.068 region:rollup2
HAVING AN UNFILTERED CIGARETTE.

00:47:49.367 --> 00:47:52.203 region:rollup2
THAT'S TOSSED BY SMOKERS AS

00:47:51.068 --> 00:47:55.673 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE.

00:47:52.203 --> 00:47:57.274 region:rollup2
THIS ISSUE OF THE STORM WATER

00:47:55.673 --> 00:47:59.043 region:rollup2
REGULATION I THINK THAT WE MAY

00:47:57.274 --> 00:48:00.945 region:rollup2
JUST REMIND YOU THAT THERE'S A

00:47:59.043 --> 00:48:02.913 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA CLEAN WATER ACT. THAT

00:48:00.945 --> 00:48:04.248 region:rollup2
HAS THE TRASH AND ADMIT THAT

00:48:02.913 --> 00:48:06.450 region:rollup2
WILL REQUIRE COMMUNITIES

00:48:04.248 --> 00:48:07.718 region:rollup2
TO WITHIN THE NEXT TEN YEARS OF

00:54:11.315 --> 00:54:15.152 region:rollup2
NUMEROUS CHANGES IN STATE LAW IN

00:54:13.217 --> 00:54:16.186 region:rollup2
THE IN RECENT PAST. ON MANY OF

00:54:15.152 --> 00:54:17.788 region:rollup2
THOSE WE UNDERSTAND WERE

00:54:16.186 --> 00:54:19.756 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT POLICY MATTERS RAISING

00:54:17.788 --> 00:54:21.425 region:rollup2
CIGARETTE SMOKING AGE TO

00:54:19.756 --> 00:54:23.060 region:rollup2
INCREASING RECENTLY CIGARETTE

00:54:21.425 --> 00:54:24.828 region:rollup2
TAXES I'M OVER THE SEVEN YEARS

00:54:23.060 --> 00:54:26.330 region:rollup2
AGO MOVING PEOPLE FROM SMOKING

00:54:24.828 --> 00:54:27.531 region:rollup2
INDOORS AT SUCH A NUMBER OF

00:54:26.330 --> 00:54:29.466 region:rollup2
THOSE POLICIES.

00:54:27.531 --> 00:54:30.601 region:rollup2
AGAIN LEGAL SMOKERS UNDERSTOOD

00:54:29.466 --> 00:54:31.869 region:rollup2
AND HAVE AND HAVE GRAPPLED WITH

00:54:30.601 --> 00:54:33.637 region:rollup2
AN ADDRESSED.

00:54:31.869 --> 00:54:34.738 region:rollup2
LEGAL SMOKERS TODAY HAVE A

00:54:33.637 --> 00:54:36.306 region:rollup2
CHOICE OF A FILTER CIGARETTE

00:54:34.738 --> 00:54:38.008 region:rollup2
UNFILTERED CIGARETTE THAT IS

00:54:36.306 --> 00:54:39.109 region:rollup2
TRUE AND YET THE CHOICE OF THE

00:54:38.008 --> 00:54:40.911 region:rollup2
OVERWHELMINGLY MAKE IS FOR

00:54:39.109 --> 00:54:42.379 region:rollup2
FILTERED CIGARETTE NORTH OF

00:54:40.911 --> 00:54:44.314 region:rollup2
NINETY PERCENT OF THE SALES OR.

00:54:42.379 --> 00:54:45.916 region:rollup2
FILTERED CIGARETTES AND SO THIS

00:54:44.314 --> 00:54:47.084 region:rollup2
IS YET ANOTHER IN THEIR EYES IN

00:54:45.916 --> 00:54:48.285 region:rollup2
THE EYES OF THE RETAILERS THAT

00:54:47.084 --> 00:54:49.686 region:rollup2
THAT WORK WITH THEIR CUSTOMERS

00:54:48.285 --> 00:54:51.355 region:rollup2
THIS IS ANOTHER SIGNIFICANT

00:54:49.686 --> 00:54:53.190 region:rollup2
CHANGE TO WHAT IS OTHERWISE A

00:54:51.355 --> 00:54:54.291 region:rollup2
LEGAL PRODUCT. WE'D CERTAINLY

00:54:53.190 --> 00:54:55.926 region:rollup2
SYMPATHIZE AND UNDERSTAND THE

00:54:54.291 --> 00:54:57.194 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT IN FRUSTRATION.

00:54:55.926 --> 00:54:58.529 region:rollup2
IN ALL COMMUNITIES NOT JUST

00:54:57.194 --> 00:54:59.863 region:rollup2
BEACH COMMUNITIES ABOUT LETTER

00:54:58.529 --> 00:55:01.198 region:rollup2
AND CERTAINLY WOULD SUPPORT MORE

00:54:59.863 --> 00:55:02.466 region:rollup2
TO BE DONE TO EDUCATE AND IN

00:55:01.198 --> 00:55:03.433 region:rollup2
FACT I DON'T THINK A TEN

00:55:02.466 --> 00:55:05.402 region:rollup2
THOUSAND DOLLAR FINE IS

00:55:03.433 --> 00:55:06.637 region:rollup2
WARRANTED BUT SOME ADDITIONAL

00:55:05.402 --> 00:55:07.371 region:rollup2
ENFORCEMENT AROUND LETTER WILL

00:55:06.637 --> 00:55:08.939 region:rollup2
STICK MAKES SENSE.

00:55:07.371 --> 00:55:10.040 region:rollup2
AND THIS IS UNFORTUNATELY FOR

00:55:08.939 --> 00:55:11.608 region:rollup2
FOR THE RETAIL COMMUNITY FOR THE

00:55:10.040 --> 00:55:12.576 region:rollup2
CUSTOMERS THAT WE SERVE YET

00:55:11.608 --> 00:55:15.045 region:rollup2
ANOTHER.

00:55:12.576 --> 00:55:16.280 region:rollup2
IF YOU WILL 쉛D

00:55:15.045 --> 00:55:18.048 region:rollup2
IS THEIR ABILITY TO CONSUME A

00:55:16.280 --> 00:55:18.916 region:rollup2
LEGAL PRODUCT

00:55:18.048 --> 00:55:20.951 region:rollup2
BUT THAT MAY RESPECTFULLY ASK

00:55:18.916 --> 00:55:22.085 region:rollup2
FOR NOBLE.

00:55:20.951 --> 00:55:23.453 region:rollup2
CHAIRMAN MEMBERS GENEROUSLY

00:55:22.085 --> 00:55:24.988 region:rollup2
PREFER THE CALIFORNIA SUGARS

00:55:23.453 --> 00:55:26.823 region:rollup2
SOCIALIZATION.

00:55:24.988 --> 00:55:28.525 region:rollup2
HARD DATA SHOWS THAT NINETY

00:55:26.823 --> 00:55:30.694 region:rollup2
NINE POINT SEVEN PERCENT OF

00:55:28.525 --> 00:55:32.429 region:rollup2
THOSE CIGARETTES HOLDING BUYER

00:55:30.694 --> 00:55:34.064 region:rollup2
DISTRIBUTORS WHICH FOR THOSE

00:55:32.429 --> 00:55:35.999 region:rollup2
LARGEST IN THE COUNTRY. AND IN

00:55:34.064 --> 00:55:37.801 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

00:55:35.999 --> 00:55:38.869 region:rollup2
ART FILTERED CIGARETTES

00:55:37.801 --> 00:55:40.370 region:rollup2
SO THREE TENTHS OF ONE PERCENT

00:55:38.869 --> 00:55:42.105 region:rollup2
OR NON FILTERED.

00:55:40.370 --> 00:55:43.340 region:rollup2
OF THE QUESTION BECOMES AS TO

00:55:42.105 --> 00:55:45.042 region:rollup2
WHERE DOES THAT CONSUMER GO TO.

00:55:43.340 --> 00:55:46.710 region:rollup2
.

00:55:45.042 --> 00:55:48.111 region:rollup2
TOOK TO STILL BE ABLE TO GET

00:55:46.710 --> 00:55:49.279 region:rollup2
FILTERED CIGARETTES BECAUSE

00:55:48.111 --> 00:55:50.447 region:rollup2
I'M NOT CONVINCED THAT YOU'RE

00:55:49.279 --> 00:55:51.949 region:rollup2
GONNA MOVE THAT BIGGER

00:55:50.447 --> 00:55:53.617 region:rollup2
POPULATION AWAY FROM WHAT

00:55:51.949 --> 00:55:55.252 region:rollup2
THEY'VE BEEN USED TO.

00:55:53.617 --> 00:55:56.253 region:rollup2
THE IT'S COULD HAVE TO BE

00:55:55.252 --> 00:55:57.387 region:rollup2
CONTRABAND IT'S EITHER GONNA

00:55:56.253 --> 00:56:00.157 region:rollup2

AREAS THAT.

00:56:05.729 --> 00:56:08.865 region:rollup2
WILL WHERE YOU CAN WILL BE ABLE

00:56:07.297 --> 00:56:09.867 region:rollup2
TO BUY THE PRODUCT WILL BE

00:56:08.865 --> 00:56:13.237 region:rollup2
CONTRABAND PRODUCT.

00:56:09.867 --> 00:56:14.171 region:rollup2
AND I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THAT

00:56:13.237 --> 00:56:15.339 region:rollup2
THAT'S THAT'S GOING TO STOP

00:56:14.171 --> 00:56:17.908 region:rollup2
PEOPLE FROM DOING THAT.

00:56:15.339 --> 00:56:20.510 region:rollup2
URINALYSIS IS VERY CORRECT THAT

00:56:17.908 --> 00:56:21.945 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW WITH RAISINS SURTAX.

00:56:20.510 --> 00:56:23.914 region:rollup2
OUR COUNTRY BANDS COME BACK UP

THIS WOULD JUST EXASPERATED. ARE

00:56:25.682 --> 00:56:28.619 region:rollup2
FOR THOSE REASONS SINCE MIGHT

00:56:27.417 --> 00:56:30.988 region:rollup2
MEMBERS ARE THE TAXPAYERS WE

00:56:28.619 --> 00:56:31.922 region:rollup2
MUST POSE.

00:56:37.194 --> 00:56:40.631 region:rollup2
TODAY TO EXPRESS THEIR CONCERN.

00:56:38.862 --> 00:56:41.732 region:rollup2
THAT WE AGREE ACTUALLY WITH ONE

00:56:40.631 --> 00:56:43.267 region:rollup2
OF THE PROPONENTS OF THE MEASURE

00:56:41.732 --> 00:56:44.534 region:rollup2
THAT SAID THAT OF BEHAVIOR

00:56:43.267 --> 00:56:45.535 region:rollup2
DOESN'T CHANGE VERY MUCH WE

00:56:44.534 --> 00:56:47.237 region:rollup2
HAVEN'T SEEN A WHOLE LOT OF

00:56:45.535 --> 00:56:48.572 region:rollup2
CHANGE IN BEHAVIOR. AND WE THINK

00:56:47.237 --> 00:56:50.374 region:rollup2
THAT THAT ACTUALLY ARGUES

00:56:48.572 --> 00:56:52.175 region:rollup2
AGAINST THE BILL BUT WE DON'T

00:56:50.374 --> 00:56:54.044 region:rollup2
BELIEVE THAT OF BANNING THE

00:56:52.175 --> 00:56:55.545 region:rollup2
FILTERED CIGARETTE SALES AS MR

00:56:54.044 --> 00:56:57.080 region:rollup2
LOW PER POINTS OUT HEARD NINETY

00:56:55.545 --> 00:56:59.950 region:rollup2
NINE PERCENT OF CIGARETTE SALES.

00:56:57.080 --> 00:57:01.818 region:rollup2
IN CALIFORNIA IS GOING TO A

00:56:59.950 --> 00:57:03.587 region:rollup2
SOMEHOW CHANGE THE PREFERENCE OF

00:57:01.818 --> 00:57:04.788 region:rollup2
THOSE SMOKERS WHO ARE BUYING

00:57:03.587 --> 00:57:06.556 region:rollup2
FILTERED CIGARETTES AND.

00:57:04.788 --> 00:57:08.725 region:rollup2
IT CHANGED INTO A STARK

00:57:06.556 --> 00:57:09.826 region:rollup2
CONSUMING A NON DISPOSABLE

00:57:08.725 --> 00:57:12.129 region:rollup2
FILTER AND.

00:57:09.826 --> 00:57:15.098 region:rollup2
A FOR A FILTER A CIGARETTE OR

00:57:12.129 --> 00:57:16.033 region:rollup2
SMOKING A JUST A PLAIN CIGARETTE

00:57:15.098 --> 00:57:17.901 region:rollup2
A WE THINK THAT IS MISTER LOCAL

00:57:16.033 --> 00:57:18.435 region:rollup2
POINTS OUT OF THAT WE WILL SEE

00:57:17.901 --> 00:57:20.804 region:rollup2
AN UPTICK. NOT ENCONTRABAN

00:57:18.435 --> 00:57:23.273 region:rollup2
SALES.

00:57:20.804 --> 00:57:24.341 region:rollup2
THAT WILL AT LEAST EXCEED OF

00:57:23.273 --> 00:57:26.176 region:rollup2
WHAT WE'VE SEEN WITH THE

00:57:24.341 --> 00:57:27.244 region:rollup2
CIGARETTE TAX INCREASE AND

00:57:26.176 --> 00:57:29.880 region:rollup2
UNFORTUNATELY.

00:57:27.244 --> 00:57:31.415 region:rollup2

IMPORTANT PART OF THEIR INCOME

00:57:32.716 --> 00:57:35.585 region:rollup2
OF THIS IS GOING TO HAVE A

00:57:33.950 --> 00:57:37.254 region:rollup2
DIRECT IMPACT ON THEM AND IT

THAT IS THAT IS A. POTENTIAL

01:03:12.956 --> 01:03:16.159 region:rollup2
PROBLEM HERE YOU KNOW IT WITH

01:03:14.291 --> 01:03:17.727 region:rollup2

SEEN LOTS PEOPLE BRING IN AND

01:03:17.727 --> 01:03:20.630 region:rollup2
OUT OF STATE.

01:03:18.795 --> 01:03:22.432 region:rollup2
CIGARETTES THAT'S THAT'S

01:03:20.630 --> 01:03:24.134 region:rollup2
UNDERMINE WE ARE THE SEATED THE

01:03:22.432 --> 01:03:25.135 region:rollup2
BUSINESS OWNERS WHO TESTIFIED

01:03:24.134 --> 01:03:27.037 region:rollup2
HERE THIS MORNING.

SO I SAW YOU RECOGNIZE THAT AS

01:03:27.037 --> 01:03:30.874 region:rollup2
A PROBLEM BUT.

01:03:28.672 --> 01:03:32.575 region:rollup2
WHAT WOULD YOU DO TO?

01:03:30.874 --> 01:03:33.877 region:rollup2
YOU DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT I

01:03:32.575 --> 01:03:35.745 region:rollup2
GUESS BECAUSE IF THAT'S A REAL

01:03:33.877 --> 01:03:36.846 region:rollup2
SIDE EFFECT HOW CAN WE.

01:03:35.745 --> 01:03:38.982 region:rollup2
HOW CAN WE ENFORCE THAT HOW CAN

01:03:36.846 --> 01:03:40.350 region:rollup2
WE IN SURE THAT? THAT'S NOT

01:03:38.982 --> 01:03:41.451 region:rollup2
GOING TO CONTINUE TO UNDERMINE.

01:03:40.350 --> 01:03:42.752 region:rollup2
WELL AND THAT'S ONE OF THE

01:03:41.451 --> 01:03:44.387 region:rollup2
REASONS THAT WE PUT THAT THE

01:03:42.752 --> 01:03:46.256 region:rollup2
FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR.

01:03:44.387 --> 01:03:48.491 region:rollup2
PENALTY IN THERE WHICH WAS ALSO

01:03:46.256 --> 01:03:50.293 region:rollup2
SO. OPPOSED TO TO TRY AND AND

01:03:48.491 --> 01:03:51.961 region:rollup2
SET A BAR.

01:03:50.293 --> 01:03:53.296 region:rollup2
I THINK WE HAVE A BIGGER PROBLEM

01:03:51.961 --> 01:03:54.464 region:rollup2
TO FACE AND THAT'S PIRACY IN

01:03:53.296 --> 01:03:55.665 region:rollup2
SALES OF CIGARETTES WHETHER IT'S

01:03:54.464 --> 01:03:57.701 region:rollup2
FROM.

01:03:55.665 --> 01:03:59.569 region:rollup2
THE TRIBES OR OUT OF STATE FOR

01:03:57.701 --> 01:04:01.237 region:rollup2
ON LINE BECAUSE YOU ARE FROM A

01:03:59.569 --> 01:04:02.806 region:rollup2
LOT OF BUSINESSES. THEY DEPEND

01:04:01.237 --> 01:04:04.374 region:rollup2
ON THE SALE OF CIGARETTES REALLY

01:04:02.806 --> 01:04:06.309 region:rollup2
FOR THEIR BUSINESS.

01:04:04.374 --> 01:04:07.744 region:rollup2
WOULD THIS HAVE AN ADDITIONAL

01:04:06.309 --> 01:04:09.212 region:rollup2
INCREMENT DRIVE SOME PIRACY

01:04:07.744 --> 01:04:10.747 region:rollup2
POTENTIALLY THAT'S SOMETHING

01:04:09.212 --> 01:04:12.515 region:rollup2
ABSOLUTELY THAT THAT'S WERE

01:04:10.747 --> 01:04:14.351 region:rollup2
STARTING IN TAKING A LOOK AT.

01:04:12.515 --> 01:04:16.152 region:rollup2
BUT I'M NOT SURE THAT JUST

01:04:14.351 --> 01:04:17.754 region:rollup2
INCREASING FINES AND PENALTIES

01:04:16.152 --> 01:04:19.622 region:rollup2
AND.

01:04:17.754 --> 01:04:21.057 region:rollup2
IS IS REALLY GOING TO TO DO THE

01:04:19.622 --> 01:04:21.524 region:rollup2
JOB I THINK WE HAVE TO DO OF A

01:04:21.057 --> 01:04:23.259 region:rollup2
BIGGER PICTURE JOB IN

01:04:21.524 --> 01:04:24.994 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

01:04:23.259 --> 01:04:25.929 region:rollup2
AND INFORM PEOPLE ABOUT ABOUT

01:04:24.994 --> 01:04:27.197 region:rollup2
WHAT'S AT STAKE SO THAT THEY'RE

01:04:25.929 --> 01:04:28.965 region:rollup2
MAKING.

01:04:27.197 --> 01:04:30.233 region:rollup2
MORE INFORMED CHOICES.

01:04:28.965 --> 01:04:31.601 region:rollup2
I WOULD THINK ANNA AND I

01:04:30.233 --> 01:04:33.236 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND THE OPPOSITION HERE

01:04:31.601 --> 01:04:34.704 region:rollup2
CHANGING THE PRODUCT HAVING NO

01:04:33.236 --> 01:04:36.906 region:rollup2
FILTERS.

01:04:34.704 --> 01:04:38.608 region:rollup2
ON A CIGARETTE.

01:04:36.906 --> 01:04:40.210 region:rollup2
MIGHT DISSUADE SOME PEOPLE FROM

01:04:38.608 --> 01:04:41.611 region:rollup2
CONTINUING TO SLOW A LOT OF

01:04:40.210 --> 01:04:43.346 region:rollup2
FOLKS THAT I TALK TO I'M NOT

01:04:41.611 --> 01:04:44.381 region:rollup2
CONVINCED THAT THAT'S TRUE WILL

01:04:43.346 --> 01:04:45.949 region:rollup2
LISTEN TWELVE PERCENT IT'S A

01:04:44.381 --> 01:04:47.851 region:rollup2
DECLINING GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO

01:04:45.949 --> 01:04:49.652 region:rollup2
ARE SMOKING. THEY'RE PRETTY

01:04:47.851 --> 01:04:51.354 region:rollup2
DETERMINED TO CONTINUE TO SMOKE.

01:04:49.652 --> 01:04:52.789 region:rollup2
SO I I DON'T KNOW THEY PROBABLY

01:04:51.354 --> 01:04:54.290 region:rollup2
WOULD A LOT OF THEM WOULD TAKE

01:04:52.789 --> 01:04:55.525 region:rollup2
ADVANTAGE OF THE FILTER THE

01:04:54.290 --> 01:04:56.459 region:rollup2
CIGARETTE BECAUSE THEY'RE BOUND

01:04:55.525 --> 01:04:58.695 region:rollup2
AND DETERMINED TO.

01:04:56.459 --> 01:05:00.029 region:rollup2
CONTINUE THAT HABIT.

01:04:58.695 --> 01:05:00.563 region:rollup2
WOULD THEY GET IT OUT OF STATE

01:05:00.029 --> 01:05:02.432 region:rollup2
WOULD THEY GET IT FROM THE

01:05:00.563 --> 01:05:03.767 region:rollup2
TRIBES THAT'S SOMETHING I THINK

01:05:02.432 --> 01:05:05.168 region:rollup2
WE CAN TAKE A LOOK AT IT AND

01:05:03.767 --> 01:05:06.436 region:rollup2
FIGURE OUT A MORE EFFECTIVE WAY

01:05:05.168 --> 01:05:07.537 region:rollup2
OF OF ENFORCEMENT.

01:05:06.436 --> 01:05:09.272 region:rollup2
S. THROWING NUMBERS AND AND

01:05:07.537 --> 01:05:10.607 region:rollup2
PENALTIES.

01:05:09.272 --> 01:05:12.609 region:rollup2
LEADS TO MAY NOT SOLVE THE

01:05:10.607 --> 01:05:14.511 region:rollup2
PROBLEM.

01:05:12.609 --> 01:05:15.779 region:rollup2
LISA OTHER ISSUES IN SO FOR

01:05:14.511 --> 01:05:17.614 region:rollup2
WHETHER IT'S FOR THIS BILL OR

01:05:15.779 --> 01:05:18.214 region:rollup2
WHETHER IT'S FOR THE THE LARGER

01:05:17.614 --> 01:05:20.550 region:rollup2
PROBLEM OF CIGARETTE PIRACY.

01:05:18.214 --> 01:05:21.184 region:rollup2
WE.

01:05:20.550 --> 01:05:23.419 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT'S UP TO ALL OF US

01:05:21.184 --> 01:05:25.321 region:rollup2
TO TO. TO LOOK AT HOW WE PROTECT

01:05:23.419 --> 01:05:26.656 region:rollup2
THE BUSINESS THAT THAT IS LOCAL

01:05:25.321 --> 01:05:27.891 region:rollup2
IN CALIFORNIA AND IF WE ARE

01:05:26.656 --> 01:05:29.526 region:rollup2
GOING TO SELL A PRODUCT. THAT IT

01:05:27.891 --> 01:05:30.093 region:rollup2
STAYS.

01:05:29.526 --> 01:05:31.728 region:rollup2
SO KNOW THAT THIS BILL WOULD

01:05:30.093 --> 01:05:33.062 region:rollup2
HAVE.

01:05:31.728 --> 01:05:34.497 region:rollup2
BE THAT SIGNIFICANT OF A DRIVER

01:05:33.062 --> 01:05:35.632 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY TWO DOLLARS A PACK

01:05:34.497 --> 01:05:37.767 region:rollup2
THAT'S A MUCH BIGGER DRIVER

01:05:35.632 --> 01:05:39.969 region:rollup2
PEOPLE MAKE DECISIONS. BASED ON

01:05:37.767 --> 01:05:42.005 region:rollup2
THE THEIR WALLETS MORE THAN THEY

01:05:39.969 --> 01:05:43.773 region:rollup2
DO ON THE PRODUCT

01:05:42.005 --> 01:05:45.175 region:rollup2
AND THEY'VE BEEN SOLD. A BILL OF

01:05:43.773 --> 01:05:47.110 region:rollup2
GOODS FOR MANY YEARS ON THE

01:05:45.175 --> 01:05:47.677 region:rollup2
BENEFITS OF THE FILTER FILTER

01:05:47.110 --> 01:05:48.912 region:rollup2
DOESN'T REALLY PROVIDE THOSE

01:05:47.677 --> 01:05:50.013 region:rollup2
BENEFITS.

01:05:48.912 --> 01:05:51.714 region:rollup2
ONCE THEY UNDERSTAND THAT WORK

01:05:50.013 --> 01:05:53.817 region:rollup2
THAT PRODUCTS NOT AVAILABLE BILL

01:05:51.714 --> 01:05:54.984 region:rollup2
ITEM WILL SWITCH TO AN

01:05:53.817 --> 01:05:56.519 region:rollup2
UNFILTERED CIGARETTE AND

01:05:54.984 --> 01:05:58.521 region:rollup2
CONTINUE WOULD HAVE IT. THAT'S

01:05:56.519 --> 01:05:59.122 region:rollup2
NOT A GOOD THING IN IN MY BOOK

01:05:58.521 --> 01:06:03.726 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK THAT'S A SITUATION

01:05:59.122 --> 01:06:05.962 region:rollup2
WE HAVE.

01:06:03.726 --> 01:06:07.464 region:rollup2
THIS IS GONNA JUMP IN AND.

01:06:05.962 --> 01:06:08.865 region:rollup2
CORRECT WHAT I THINK YOU MEANT

01:06:07.464 --> 01:06:11.835 region:rollup2
TO SAY AND YOU CAN CORRECT ME IF

01:06:08.865 --> 01:06:14.604 region:rollup2
I'M WRONG BUT YOU CONFLATED.

01:06:11.835 --> 01:06:17.574 region:rollup2
LEGAL SALES. OF CIGARETTES ON

01:06:14.604 --> 01:06:18.241 region:rollup2
TRIBAL LAND AND PIRACY AYE IN

01:06:17.574 --> 01:06:19.209 region:rollup2
THE BEER YOUR COMMENTS THERE AND

01:06:18.241 --> 01:06:21.377 region:rollup2
I THINK.

01:06:19.209 --> 01:06:22.412 region:rollup2
THE BLACK MARKET ILLEGAL SALES

01:06:21.377 --> 01:06:24.447 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY.

01:06:22.412 --> 01:06:26.683 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT ISSUES IT ABSOLUTELY

01:06:24.447 --> 01:06:28.518 region:rollup2
UNIFIED GETS GOOD POINT THAT WAS

01:06:26.683 --> 01:06:29.752 region:rollup2
NOT MY INTENTION BECAUSE IT

01:06:28.518 --> 01:06:32.522 region:rollup2
WOULD BE ILLEGAL SALE.

01:06:29.752 --> 01:06:34.924 region:rollup2
OUR STATE OR A LEGAL SALE.

01:06:32.522 --> 01:06:36.893 region:rollup2
IN A TRIBAL SITUATION RIGHT.

01:06:34.924 --> 01:06:39.128 region:rollup2
THOSE CORRECT TO GOING OUT OF

01:06:36.893 --> 01:06:41.397 region:rollup2
STATE WOULD BE ILLEGAL SELLING A

01:06:39.128 --> 01:06:43.466 region:rollup2
CIGARETTE EVEN UNDER THIS BILL.

01:06:41.397 --> 01:06:45.168 region:rollup2
ADD ON TRIBAL LAND IN CALIFORNIA

01:06:43.466 --> 01:06:46.669 region:rollup2
WOULD NOT BE ILLEGAL SO SOMEBODY

01:06:45.168 --> 01:06:48.872 region:rollup2
DID GO AND AND ACQUIRE

01:06:46.669 --> 01:06:50.640 region:rollup2
CIGARETTES ON TRIBAL LANDS AND

01:06:48.872 --> 01:06:51.808 region:rollup2
THEN CAME BACK INTO CALIFORNIA.

01:06:50.640 --> 01:06:52.375 region:rollup2
THAT'S NOT IT WOULD BE DOES IT

01:06:51.808 --> 01:06:54.444 region:rollup2
CONTRIBUTES TO THE TAX ISSUE

01:06:52.375 --> 01:06:55.478 region:rollup2
BUT.

01:06:54.444 --> 01:06:56.679 region:rollup2
OKAY ABSENT OR CONTRIBUTES TO

01:06:55.478 --> 01:06:57.847 region:rollup2
CONTRIBUTE TO THE TAX ISSUE

01:06:56.679 --> 01:06:58.815 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW YOUR YOUR THAT'S A

01:06:57.847 --> 01:07:00.116 region:rollup2
GOOD POINT BECAUSE THERE'S

01:06:58.815 --> 01:07:01.618 region:rollup2
THERE'S DEFINITELY A LINE THERE

01:07:00.116 --> 01:07:03.486 region:rollup2
SO GOING OUT OF STATE WERE

01:07:01.618 --> 01:07:05.588 region:rollup2
TRYING TO SUPPLY. INTO

01:07:03.486 --> 01:07:07.857 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA AND IN FACT UNDER

01:07:05.588 --> 01:07:09.592 region:rollup2
THIS BILL POTENTIALLY DRIVING

01:07:07.857 --> 01:07:11.261 region:rollup2
INTO ANOTHER STATE ACQUIRING

01:07:09.592 --> 01:07:12.595 region:rollup2
CIGARETTES AND BRINGING THEM IN

01:07:11.261 --> 01:07:13.963 region:rollup2
FOR PERSONAL USE.

01:07:12.595 --> 01:07:15.532 region:rollup2
IS NOT AN OFFENSE UNDER THIS IT

01:07:13.963 --> 01:07:16.1000 region:rollup2
WOULD BE.

01:07:15.532 --> 01:07:18.468 region:rollup2
BRINGING IN CIGARETTES AND SO

01:07:16.1000 --> 01:07:20.670 region:rollup2
THE HOPE WOULD BE THAT ALL OF

01:07:18.468 --> 01:07:21.604 region:rollup2
THE RETAILERS WHO RELY ON THE

01:07:20.670 --> 01:07:23.673 region:rollup2
SALE OF CIGARETTES FOR THEIR

01:07:21.604 --> 01:07:25.542 region:rollup2
BUSINESS THEIR SUPPLY CHAIN.

01:07:23.673 --> 01:07:27.043 region:rollup2
WOULD BE PROVIDING THEM THE

01:07:25.542 --> 01:07:28.711 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE CIGARETTES TO SOW.

01:07:27.043 --> 01:07:30.079 region:rollup2
AND AS LONG AS THEY'RE GETTING

01:07:28.711 --> 01:07:31.347 region:rollup2
UNFILTERED CIGARETTES IN THE

01:07:30.079 --> 01:07:32.782 region:rollup2
SAME QUALITY THAT THEY WERE

01:07:31.347 --> 01:07:33.283 region:rollup2
OTHERWISE A FILTER CIGARETTES

01:07:32.782 --> 01:07:34.551 region:rollup2
AND THOSE ARE STILL SELL

01:07:33.283 --> 01:07:36.119 region:rollup2
SELLING.

01:07:34.551 --> 01:07:38.021 region:rollup2
THERE'S BEEN IN THAT INSTANCE

01:07:36.119 --> 01:07:39.088 region:rollup2
NOT IMPACT ON THE.

01:07:38.021 --> 01:07:41.090 region:rollup2
IT CERTAINLY DOES ILLUSTRATE.

01:07:39.088 --> 01:07:42.892 region:rollup2
THE DIFFICULTY.

01:07:41.090 --> 01:07:44.494 region:rollup2
THAT WE FACED WITH BLACK MARKET

01:07:42.892 --> 01:07:44.894 region:rollup2
ISSUES AROUND TOBACCO THAT'S NOT

01:07:44.494 --> 01:07:46.462 region:rollup2
THE ISSUE IN THE.

01:07:44.894 --> 01:07:47.263 region:rollup2
.

01:07:46.462 --> 01:07:48.765 region:rollup2
IT'S AN ISSUE THIS COMMITTEES

01:07:47.263 --> 01:07:49.198 region:rollup2
VERY FAMILIAR WITH AND HAS BEEN

01:07:48.765 --> 01:07:49.832 region:rollup2
FOR SEVERAL DECADES

01:07:49.198 --> 01:07:52.335 region:rollup2
AS-CALIFORNIA HAS STRUGGLED TO.

01:07:49.832 --> 01:07:53.770 region:rollup2
A

01:07:52.335 --> 01:07:55.805 region:rollup2
REDUCE BLACK MARKET SALES I

01:07:53.770 --> 01:07:56.372 region:rollup2
THINK THEY STILL REPRESENT

01:07:55.805 --> 01:07:59.742 region:rollup2
SOMEONE THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF

01:07:56.372 --> 01:08:00.310 region:rollup2
THIRTY PERCENT. OF TOBACCO SALES

01:07:59.742 --> 01:08:02.178 region:rollup2
IN THE STATE.

01:08:00.310 --> 01:08:04.247 region:rollup2
WHICH CONTINUES TO BE A CONCERN

01:08:02.178 --> 01:08:05.949 region:rollup2
BUT WE CERTAINLY MADE EFFORTS.

01:08:04.247 --> 01:08:08.618 region:rollup2
THIS BILL DOES PRESENT.

01:08:05.949 --> 01:08:10.420 region:rollup2
THOSE CHALLENGES.

01:08:08.618 --> 01:08:12.322 region:rollup2
I CERTAINLY COMMEND YOU FOR

01:08:10.420 --> 01:08:15.625 region:rollup2
CONTINUING TO TRY DRESSES ISSUE

01:08:12.322 --> 01:08:17.126 region:rollup2
I THINK THE ENTIRE COMMITTEE.

01:08:15.625 --> 01:08:19.329 region:rollup2
THAT BODY AGREES THAT THE

01:08:17.126 --> 01:08:21.331 region:rollup2
LITTERING ISSUE AS IT RELATES TO

01:08:19.329 --> 01:08:21.931 region:rollup2
STRIP MUCH IS A IS A SIGNIFICANT

01:08:21.331 --> 01:08:23.766 region:rollup2
ISSUE AND ONE THAT NEEDS TO BE

01:08:21.931 --> 01:08:25.068 region:rollup2
ADDRESSED.

01:08:23.766 --> 01:08:27.537 region:rollup2
I THINK WE CONTINUE TO DISAGREE.

01:08:25.068 --> 01:08:29.772 region:rollup2
ON THE APPROACH.

01:08:27.537 --> 01:08:30.773 region:rollup2
TO TAKE YOU KNOW CERTAINLY.

01:08:29.772 --> 01:08:32.508 region:rollup2
THE BLACK MARKET ISSUE.

01:08:30.773 --> 01:08:33.009 region:rollup2
IS FIRST AND FOREMOST ON MY

01:08:32.508 --> 01:08:35.111 region:rollup2
MIND.

01:08:33.009 --> 01:08:36.512 region:rollup2
.

01:08:35.111 --> 01:08:38.281 region:rollup2
BUT THE HOUSE IT HEALTH ISSUE

01:08:36.512 --> 01:08:39.882 region:rollup2
ALSO ARE TO MAP I WANTED STATE

01:08:38.281 --> 01:08:41.918 region:rollup2
DEPT YOU TO ASK THE GENTLEMAN

01:08:39.882 --> 01:08:46.889 region:rollup2
FROM SAN DIEGO YOU. RAISE THE

01:08:41.918 --> 01:08:49.225 region:rollup2
ISSUE OF FILTERED CIGARETTES.

01:08:46.889 --> 01:08:51.194 region:rollup2
PRESENTING AN ADDITIONAL HEALTH

01:08:49.225 --> 01:08:52.762 region:rollup2
CONCERN OVER UNFILTERED

01:08:51.194 --> 01:08:53.696 region:rollup2
CIGARETTES

01:08:52.762 --> 01:08:55.231 region:rollup2
AND I'M CURIOUS IF THAT WERE THE

01:08:53.696 --> 01:08:56.799 region:rollup2
CASE.

01:08:55.231 --> 01:08:57.867 region:rollup2
OR IF THAT IS THE CASE AND IF

01:08:56.799 --> 01:08:59.636 region:rollup2
THE SCIENCE.

01:08:57.867 --> 01:09:02.205 region:rollup2
IS CLEAR ON THAT

01:08:59.636 --> 01:09:02.939 region:rollup2
AND WHY THE FDA HASN'T TAKEN

01:09:02.205 --> 01:09:05.074 region:rollup2
ACTIONS TO BE HIM FILTERED

01:09:02.939 --> 01:09:07.176 region:rollup2
CIGARETTES.

01:09:05.074 --> 01:09:07.977 region:rollup2
WHAT MY THOUGHTS ARE ON THAT?

01:09:07.176 --> 01:09:10.013 region:rollup2
IT'S A GOOD QUESTION.

01:09:07.977 --> 01:09:11.347 region:rollup2
ACTOR I JUST TO STEP DOWN AS

01:09:10.013 --> 01:09:13.816 region:rollup2
DEPUTY ASSISTANT SECRETARY FOR

01:09:11.347 --> 01:09:15.618 region:rollup2
HEALTH IN HHS AND I GET IN THAT

01:09:13.816 --> 01:09:17.253 region:rollup2
POSITION I. CO CHAIRED WITH THE

01:09:15.618 --> 01:09:18.788 region:rollup2
SURGEON GENERAL THE INTERAGENCY

01:09:17.253 --> 01:09:20.356 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE ON THE BACK ON HEALTH

01:09:18.788 --> 01:09:21.891 region:rollup2
I WAS BRINGING THIS ISSUE

01:09:20.356 --> 01:09:23.459 region:rollup2
FORWARD UNTIL.

01:09:21.891 --> 01:09:25.695 region:rollup2
UNTIL ELECTION HAPPENED.

01:09:23.459 --> 01:09:27.196 region:rollup2
AND THEN I HAD TO.

01:09:25.695 --> 01:09:28.464 region:rollup2
CHANGE CHAU MY YOU KNOW MY

01:09:27.196 --> 01:09:29.165 region:rollup2
VENUE BUT.

01:09:28.464 --> 01:09:31.968 region:rollup2
THE.

01:09:29.165 --> 01:09:32.268 region:rollup2
AT THE QUESTIONS I DID ASK THE

01:09:31.968 --> 01:09:33.269 region:rollup2
FDA ON THIS.

01:09:32.268 --> 01:09:34.871 region:rollup2
WERE.

01:09:33.269 --> 01:09:36.239 region:rollup2
RECEIVED WITH INTEREST AND I

01:09:34.871 --> 01:09:38.908 region:rollup2
THINK THEY ARE INTERESTED IN IN

01:09:36.239 --> 01:09:39.208 region:rollup2
THIS ISSUE. AT WHAT THE CAME

01:09:38.908 --> 01:09:40.376 region:rollup2
BACK TO ME.

01:09:39.208 --> 01:09:41.310 region:rollup2
AND

01:09:40.376 --> 01:09:43.546 region:rollup2
TERMS OF THEIR.

01:09:41.310 --> 01:09:45.114 region:rollup2
A REASON NOT TO DO THIS IS THIS

01:09:43.546 --> 01:09:46.816 region:rollup2
COULD BE DONE AT THE STATE LEVEL

01:09:45.114 --> 01:09:48.851 region:rollup2
AND ACTUALLY SUGGESTED THAT THAT

01:09:46.816 --> 01:09:51.154 region:rollup2
MAYBE A BETTER ROUTE THAN TRYING

01:09:48.851 --> 01:09:52.555 region:rollup2
TO DEAL WITH. THE LAWSUITS THAT

01:09:51.154 --> 01:09:54.257 region:rollup2
THEY GET AGAINST THE FTA

01:09:52.555 --> 01:09:56.192 region:rollup2
INCESSANTLY FROM THE TOBACCO

01:09:54.257 --> 01:09:57.593 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY THAT JUST.

01:09:56.192 --> 01:09:58.594 region:rollup2
STOPS EVERYTHING THEY'RE TRYING

01:09:57.593 --> 01:10:00.663 region:rollup2
TO DO WHAT THEY CAN AND

01:09:58.594 --> 01:10:02.165 region:rollup2
INCREMENTAL BASIS TO REGULATE

01:10:00.663 --> 01:10:04.801 region:rollup2
TOBACCO IN THIS ONE IT WAS OF A

01:10:02.165 --> 01:10:06.302 region:rollup2
BIG STEP FOR THEM TO TAKE.

01:10:04.801 --> 01:10:07.437 region:rollup2
NOW I KNOW THERE'S BEEN ARE.

01:10:06.302 --> 01:10:09.005 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT EFFORTS OF THESE

01:10:07.437 --> 01:10:11.474 region:rollup2
ARGUMENTS MADE

01:10:09.005 --> 01:10:14.043 region:rollup2
THAT TRANSITIONING. CONSUMERS TO

01:10:11.474 --> 01:10:15.578 region:rollup2
E. CIGARETTES ARE CAN HAVE SOME

01:10:14.043 --> 01:10:17.046 region:rollup2
PERIPHERAL OR OR BYPRODUCT

01:10:15.578 --> 01:10:18.581 region:rollup2
HEALTH BENEFIT.

01:10:17.046 --> 01:10:20.817 region:rollup2
STRIKES ME THAT WOULD ALSO

01:10:18.581 --> 01:10:23.286 region:rollup2
POTENTIALLY HAVE. A BENEFIT IN

01:10:20.817 --> 01:10:24.954 region:rollup2
THIS AREA IS THAT. GONNA FOCUS.

01:10:23.286 --> 01:10:27.356 region:rollup2
FOR YOU AS WELL.

01:10:24.954 --> 01:10:28.758 region:rollup2
WELL ON. IN THERE'S A LOT THAT'S

01:10:27.356 --> 01:10:31.127 region:rollup2
UNKNOWN ABOUT THE.

01:10:28.758 --> 01:10:32.462 region:rollup2
BENEFITS OR RISKS OF E.

01:10:31.127 --> 01:10:34.163 region:rollup2
CIGARETTES AS YET THEY ARE NOT

01:10:32.462 --> 01:10:35.465 region:rollup2
YET REGULATED. THAT'S BEEN

01:10:34.163 --> 01:10:37.266 region:rollup2
DELAYED FOR SOMETIME ALTHOUGH

01:10:35.465 --> 01:10:37.834 region:rollup2
THE AYE IF HE'S GETTING A LITTLE

01:10:37.266 --> 01:10:39.235 region:rollup2
BIT MORE.

01:10:37.834 --> 01:10:40.369 region:rollup2
INTERESTED IN A SPECIAL WITH

01:10:39.235 --> 01:10:41.604 region:rollup2
JEWEL THAT'S BEEN AFFECT

01:10:40.369 --> 01:10:43.940 region:rollup2
EFFECTING YOUNG PEOPLE

01:10:41.604 --> 01:10:44.440 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY THERE'S NOTHING GOOD

01:10:43.940 --> 01:10:45.641 region:rollup2
ABOUT BEING ADDICTED TO

01:10:44.440 --> 01:10:48.010 region:rollup2
NICOTINE.

01:10:45.641 --> 01:10:49.846 region:rollup2
ADULTS OR CHILDREN AND THE

01:10:48.010 --> 01:10:50.880 region:rollup2
CIGARETTE IS ANOTHER WAY OF

01:10:49.846 --> 01:10:52.515 region:rollup2
BECOMING ADDICTED TO THIS TODAY

01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:54.183 region:rollup2
KATANA MY PERSONAL OPINION ON

01:10:52.515 --> 01:10:56.819 region:rollup2
THIS IS THAT. NOW WE NEED TO

01:10:54.183 --> 01:10:59.822 region:rollup2
WORK AGAINST THAT CD THE FDA IS

01:10:56.819 --> 01:11:03.493 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY WORKING TO REDUCE

01:10:59.822 --> 01:11:04.360 region:rollup2
NICOTINE IN GENERAL DE AS THE

01:11:03.493 --> 01:11:06.529 region:rollup2
SOURCE OF A CONTINUED SMOKING.

01:11:04.360 --> 01:11:08.564 region:rollup2
SO THE ONLY OTHER ISSUE I I

01:11:06.529 --> 01:11:10.666 region:rollup2
THINK IS IS WORTH THINKING ABOUT

01:11:08.564 --> 01:11:12.168 region:rollup2
IS THAT THE CIGARETTES ARE E.

01:11:10.666 --> 01:11:13.703 region:rollup2
WASTE. THEY'VE GOT A BATTERY

01:11:12.168 --> 01:11:14.804 region:rollup2
THEY'VE GOT DOES SOLUTION THAT'S

01:11:13.703 --> 01:11:16.672 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY POISONOUS.

01:11:14.804 --> 01:11:17.373 region:rollup2
THAT YOU KNOW OF KIDS WHO GET

01:11:16.672 --> 01:11:19.442 region:rollup2
INTO IT.

01:11:17.373 --> 01:11:20.877 region:rollup2
ME IT IS SOMETHING I CAN BE A

01:11:19.442 --> 01:11:22.111 region:rollup2
RISK AS WELL SO I THINK THAT

01:11:20.877 --> 01:11:23.913 region:rollup2
THERE ARE SOME DOWNSIDES AS WELL

01:11:22.111 --> 01:11:25.081 region:rollup2
THE OTHER ISSUES THAT IT'S BEEN

01:11:23.913 --> 01:11:27.150 region:rollup2
SHOWN THAT THERE'S A LOT OF DUAL

01:11:25.081 --> 01:11:29.418 region:rollup2
USE. INTO STAINING SMOKING

01:11:27.150 --> 01:11:31.854 region:rollup2
RATHER THAN AND IT REALLY.

01:11:29.418 --> 01:11:33.322 region:rollup2
GETTING PEOPLE TO QUIT.

01:11:31.854 --> 01:11:33.723 region:rollup2
NO ALSO ANOTHER STERN TEST WHERE

01:11:33.322 --> 01:11:36.325 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:11:33.723 --> 01:11:37.560 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE OTHER HEALTH

01:11:36.325 --> 01:11:38.060 region:rollup2
ADVOCACY GROUPS.

01:11:37.560 --> 01:11:40.062 region:rollup2
SUCH AS AMERICAN LUNG

01:11:38.060 --> 01:11:41.898 region:rollup2
ASSOCIATION ARE CESSATION WORK

01:11:40.062 --> 01:11:43.199 region:rollup2
HERE IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL.

01:11:41.898 --> 01:11:44.167 region:rollup2
EYES THAT JUST BECAUSE THEY'RE

01:11:43.199 --> 01:11:45.701 region:rollup2
NOT HERE ARE THEY IN FACT NOT IN

01:11:44.167 --> 01:11:46.802 region:rollup2
SUPPORT OF THE BILL.

01:11:45.701 --> 01:11:48.137 region:rollup2
NO THEY'RE NOT SUPPORTING THE

01:11:46.802 --> 01:11:49.372 region:rollup2
BILL AT THIS POINT THAT THE

01:11:48.137 --> 01:11:50.773 region:rollup2
FOLKS IN CALIFORNIA THAT I'VE

01:11:49.372 --> 01:11:52.074 region:rollup2
BEEN TALKING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT

01:11:50.773 --> 01:11:53.609 region:rollup2
WE'RE TRYING TO DO BUT ON THE

01:11:52.074 --> 01:11:55.211 region:rollup2
NATIONAL LEVEL THEY'RE NOT THERE

01:11:53.609 --> 01:11:56.746 region:rollup2
YET AND THE REASON IS. IS

01:11:55.211 --> 01:11:58.214 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THIS WOULD PROMOTE ONE

01:11:56.746 --> 01:11:59.515 region:rollup2
TYPE OF CIGARETTE OVER ANOTHER

01:11:58.214 --> 01:12:00.149 region:rollup2
AND FOR NOT BANNING CIGARETTES

01:11:59.515 --> 01:12:04.187 region:rollup2
ALTOGETHER. THEY'RE NOT

01:12:00.149 --> 01:12:05.721 region:rollup2
INTERESTED.

01:12:04.187 --> 01:12:06.989 region:rollup2
WHICH STRIKES ME IN THAT WHOLE

01:12:05.721 --> 01:12:07.456 region:rollup2
HEALTH DISCUSSION THE JUST SEEMS

01:12:06.989 --> 01:12:10.726 region:rollup2
INCONCLUSIVE AT BEST.

01:12:07.456 --> 01:12:11.727 region:rollup2
.

01:12:10.726 --> 01:12:13.262 region:rollup2
YEAH THAT THAT THE THIRD ISSUE.

01:12:11.727 --> 01:12:14.430 region:rollup2
.

01:12:13.262 --> 01:12:15.998 region:rollup2
THAT COMES TO MIND WAS REYES NOT

01:12:14.430 --> 01:12:17.934 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION AND WAS ADDRESSED

01:12:15.998 --> 01:12:19.068 region:rollup2
SOMEWHAT.

01:12:17.934 --> 01:12:20.203 region:rollup2
WAS THIS QUESTION OF WHETHER OR

01:12:19.068 --> 01:12:20.770 region:rollup2
NOT FEDERAL LAW PROHIBITS IT

01:12:20.203 --> 01:12:21.771 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY THEY'RE DIFFERENT

01:12:20.770 --> 01:12:23.773 region:rollup2
OPINIONS ON THAT.

01:12:21.771 --> 01:12:26.209 region:rollup2
.

01:12:23.773 --> 01:12:27.310 region:rollup2
WE CERTAINLY.

01:12:26.209 --> 01:12:28.144 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE ANY CONCLUSIVE

01:12:27.310 --> 01:12:30.680 region:rollup2
DIRECTION.

01:12:28.144 --> 01:12:31.247 region:rollup2
AND.

01:12:30.680 --> 01:12:32.949 region:rollup2
YOUR FOURTH IN THAT REALLY

01:12:31.247 --> 01:12:35.218 region:rollup2
CONCERNS HO THE BILL WERE STONE

01:12:32.949 --> 01:12:35.785 region:rollup2
AND AND DID THE LAST TIME.

01:12:35.218 --> 01:12:37.186 region:rollup2
WE SAW THIS BILL BEFORE THE

01:12:35.785 --> 01:12:40.056 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE.

01:12:37.186 --> 01:12:41.190 region:rollup2
I IS IT JUST SEEMS MISPLACED TO

01:12:40.056 --> 01:12:42.625 region:rollup2
LAY THE BURDEN.

01:12:41.190 --> 01:12:44.460 region:rollup2
AT THE DOORSTEP OF THE

01:12:42.625 --> 01:12:46.095 region:rollup2
RETAILERS.

01:12:44.460 --> 01:12:47.196 region:rollup2
RATHER THAN THE DOORSTEP OF THE

01:12:46.095 --> 01:12:48.864 region:rollup2
PERPETRATORS OF THE CRIME WHICH

01:12:47.196 --> 01:12:49.865 region:rollup2
IS THE LETTERING.

01:12:48.864 --> 01:12:51.500 region:rollup2
AND I DON'T KNOW THAT I AGREE

01:12:49.865 --> 01:12:53.369 region:rollup2
WITH WITH THE COMMENTS THAT YOU

01:12:51.500 --> 01:12:55.304 region:rollup2
SHARED.

01:12:53.369 --> 01:12:56.606 region:rollup2
REGARDING INCREASED FINES. AND I

01:12:55.304 --> 01:12:57.940 region:rollup2
WOULD ADD TO THAT ENFORCEMENT

01:12:56.606 --> 01:12:59.275 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I THINK WE ALL AGREE

01:12:57.940 --> 01:13:01.510 region:rollup2
FINDS ARE ONE THING BUT FINDS

01:12:59.275 --> 01:13:03.446 region:rollup2
NOT FORCED OR ARE LARGE LUCIOUS

01:13:01.510 --> 01:13:04.981 region:rollup2
WE HAVE SEEN THE EDUCATION. OF

01:13:03.446 --> 01:13:06.649 region:rollup2
FINES AND ENFORCEMENT HAVE

01:13:04.981 --> 01:13:08.251 region:rollup2
HANDSOME SIGNIFICANTLY POSITIVE

01:13:06.649 --> 01:13:09.986 region:rollup2
IMPACTS AND THERE'S A DRUNK

01:13:08.251 --> 01:13:12.121 region:rollup2
DRIVING.

01:13:09.986 --> 01:13:14.156 region:rollup2
AND. IT SEEMS THAT THEY COULD

01:13:12.121 --> 01:13:15.324 region:rollup2
HAVE A SIMILARLY. A POSITIVE

01:13:14.156 --> 01:13:16.592 region:rollup2
EFFECTS IF WE WERE TO

01:13:15.324 --> 01:13:18.728 region:rollup2
DRASTICALLY INCREASE THE FINE

01:13:16.592 --> 01:13:19.662 region:rollup2
AND AND COUPLE THAT WITH SERIOUS

01:13:18.728 --> 01:13:21.631 region:rollup2
ENFORCEMENT.

01:13:19.662 --> 01:13:23.232 region:rollup2
EDUCATION THE SEEMS LIKE WE

01:13:21.631 --> 01:13:24.734 region:rollup2
COULD MAKE AN IMPACT HIM TO

01:13:23.232 --> 01:13:26.235 region:rollup2
COMMENT ON THAT YEAH.

01:13:24.734 --> 01:13:28.471 region:rollup2
POTENTIALLY THAT THE PROBLEM

01:13:26.235 --> 01:13:30.907 region:rollup2
WITH THIS PARTICULAR CRIME OF

01:13:28.471 --> 01:13:31.340 region:rollup2
LITTERING AND I'M NOT. I DON'T

01:13:30.907 --> 01:13:32.375 region:rollup2
KNOW THAT.

01:13:31.340 --> 01:13:33.309 region:rollup2
RAISING THE THE FIVE THOUSAND

01:13:32.375 --> 01:13:35.411 region:rollup2
DOLLARS.

01:13:33.309 --> 01:13:36.312 region:rollup2
CIGARETTE.

01:13:35.411 --> 01:13:38.014 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S POTENTIALLY THOUSAND

01:13:36.312 --> 01:13:38.614 region:rollup2
DOLLARS SPECIAL OUT OF A MOVING

01:13:38.014 --> 01:13:41.250 region:rollup2
VEHICLE ESPECIALLY DURING FIRE

01:13:38.614 --> 01:13:41.817 region:rollup2
SEASON.

01:13:41.250 --> 01:13:43.052 region:rollup2
LAW ENFORCEMENT NEEDS TO SEE

01:13:41.817 --> 01:13:45.488 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:13:43.052 --> 01:13:47.056 region:rollup2
IT'S A VERY QUICK DISTINCT OR OR

01:13:45.488 --> 01:13:49.058 region:rollup2
SMOKER ON THE BEACH OR IN A PARK

01:13:47.056 --> 01:13:50.126 region:rollup2
OR ON OUR GROUNDS.

01:13:49.058 --> 01:13:51.093 region:rollup2
LOOK OUT EFFECTIVE WE ARE TO

01:13:50.126 --> 01:13:52.795 region:rollup2
FORCING IT ON OUR OWN CAPITAL

01:13:51.093 --> 01:13:53.562 region:rollup2
GRANTS.

01:13:52.795 --> 01:13:55.298 region:rollup2
AND THIS IS AN AREA THAT'S

01:13:53.562 --> 01:13:56.699 region:rollup2
POLICED DAILY.

01:13:55.298 --> 01:13:58.000 region:rollup2
AND YET WALKER AND NOW IN THE

01:13:56.699 --> 01:13:59.335 region:rollup2
AFTERNOON AND YOU'LL SEE

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:01.003 region:rollup2
CIGARETTE* EVERYWHERE THAT

01:13:59.335 --> 01:14:03.272 region:rollup2
ACTS

01:14:01.003 --> 01:14:04.307 region:rollup2
DROPPING IT STEPPING ON IT.

01:14:03.272 --> 01:14:07.209 region:rollup2
IS POTENTIALLY THOUSAND DOLLAR

01:14:04.307 --> 01:14:09.512 region:rollup2
FINE DOESN'T SEEM TO IMPACTS.

01:14:07.209 --> 01:14:11.147 region:rollup2
HERE AND THE WITH ALL THE CHP

01:14:09.512 --> 01:14:12.448 region:rollup2
AND THE GROUNDS.

01:14:11.147 --> 01:14:14.784 region:rollup2
CREW AND EVERYONE WHO'S HERE ON

01:14:12.448 --> 01:14:16.852 region:rollup2
OUR CAPITOL GROUNDS.

01:14:14.784 --> 01:14:18.354 region:rollup2
THAT ILLEGAL ACTS WITH PLENTY

01:14:16.852 --> 01:14:20.122 region:rollup2
PEOPLE AROUND TO POTENTIALLY

01:14:18.354 --> 01:14:21.457 region:rollup2
ENFORCED. DOESN'T SEEM TO MAKE

01:14:20.122 --> 01:14:22.591 region:rollup2
MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE SO WE COULD

01:14:21.457 --> 01:14:24.493 region:rollup2
SPEND A LOT OF MONEY ON LOCAL

01:14:22.591 --> 01:14:25.061 region:rollup2
LAW ENFORCEMENT.

01:14:24.493 --> 01:14:26.362 region:rollup2
WE COULD ASK THEM TO GO AND

01:14:25.061 --> 01:14:29.231 region:rollup2
FORCE.

01:14:26.362 --> 01:14:29.832 region:rollup2
THE LITTERING LAWS.

01:14:29.231 --> 01:14:31.334 region:rollup2
DON'T KNOW THAT THAT WOULD GO

01:14:29.832 --> 01:14:32.902 region:rollup2
OVER VERY WELL NOR DO THEY HAVE

01:14:31.334 --> 01:14:35.638 region:rollup2
THE RESOURCES FOR ESPECIALLY FOR

01:14:32.902 --> 01:14:37.073 region:rollup2
SUCH A VERY QUICK DISCRETE ACT

01:14:35.638 --> 01:14:39.542 region:rollup2
DRUNK DRIVING VERY DIFFERENT

01:14:37.073 --> 01:14:40.910 region:rollup2
OTHER IMPACTS EDUCATION AND

01:14:39.542 --> 01:14:42.578 region:rollup2
ENFORCEMENT. SURE CAN WORK

01:14:40.910 --> 01:14:44.313 region:rollup2
DEPENDING ON THE CRIME.

01:14:42.578 --> 01:14:45.915 region:rollup2
THIS IS BAD AND AN ONGOING ISSUE

01:14:44.313 --> 01:14:47.984 region:rollup2
FOR A LONG TIME THERE'S BEEN A

01:14:45.915 --> 01:14:49.185 region:rollup2
LOT OF PUBLIC. OUTREACH IN FACT

01:14:47.984 --> 01:14:51.220 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH HAS AN

01:14:49.185 --> 01:14:53.622 region:rollup2
AD SERIES ABOUT DON'T THROW YOUR

01:14:51.220 --> 01:14:55.291 region:rollup2
* AWAY AND THAT FOLLOWS A

01:14:53.622 --> 01:14:56.892 region:rollup2
CIGARETTE* OUT TO THE.

01:14:55.291 --> 01:14:58.661 region:rollup2
THE GREAT DOWN THE SEWER GRATE

01:14:56.892 --> 01:15:00.629 region:rollup2
IN AND OUT ON TO THE BEACH.

01:14:58.661 --> 01:15:02.365 region:rollup2
THEY ALSO SEEM TO BE CHANGING

01:15:00.629 --> 01:15:04.233 region:rollup2
THE BEHAVIOR OF ESPECIALLY THE

01:15:02.365 --> 01:15:06.068 region:rollup2
SMALL POPULATION THAT REMAINS

01:15:04.233 --> 01:15:07.636 region:rollup2
SMOKING.

01:15:06.068 --> 01:15:09.405 region:rollup2
SO SOMETHING WOULD WORK THERE

01:15:07.636 --> 01:15:11.741 region:rollup2
I'M OPEN TO MY GOAL HERE IS TO

01:15:09.405 --> 01:15:13.576 region:rollup2
REDUCE IS TO TO TAKE THE THE

01:15:11.741 --> 01:15:14.610 region:rollup2
MOST UBIQUITOUS ITEM A TRASH SEE

01:15:13.576 --> 01:15:15.811 region:rollup2
HOW FAR DOWN THAT LIST WE CAN

01:15:14.610 --> 01:15:17.380 region:rollup2
PUT IT.

01:15:15.811 --> 01:15:19.749 region:rollup2
THIS ISN'T AN ATTEMPT

01:15:17.380 --> 01:15:22.218 region:rollup2
I DO WAY TO DO THAT AGAIN TAKE

01:15:19.749 --> 01:15:23.619 region:rollup2
THE PRODUCT THAT'S BEING TOSSED

01:15:22.218 --> 01:15:25.521 region:rollup2
MAKE IT LESS HARMFUL IN THE

01:15:23.619 --> 01:15:26.589 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENT IT IS STILL.

01:15:25.521 --> 01:15:27.890 region:rollup2
IN THIS AN ANALYSIS IT'S STILL

01:15:26.589 --> 01:15:29.158 region:rollup2
OFFENSIVE.

01:15:27.890 --> 01:15:30.926 region:rollup2
TOSS EVEN THE FILTER THE

01:15:29.158 --> 01:15:31.961 region:rollup2
CIGARETTE*.

01:15:30.926 --> 01:15:32.928 region:rollup2
AND AND THERE MUST BE SOMEBODY

01:15:31.961 --> 01:15:34.930 region:rollup2
WHO ROLLS AROUND HERE THE

01:15:32.928 --> 01:15:36.532 region:rollup2
CAPITAL THAT KNOWS ON THE THE

01:15:34.930 --> 01:15:38.067 region:rollup2
SOUTH SIDE MORE.

01:15:36.532 --> 01:15:38.701 region:rollup2
TO ME IT'S NOT JOINTS BECAUSE

01:15:38.067 --> 01:15:39.602 region:rollup2
THERE'S QUITE A BIT OF MATERIAL

01:15:38.701 --> 01:15:41.771 region:rollup2
INSIDE OF IT.

01:15:39.602 --> 01:15:44.407 region:rollup2
BUT MORE.

01:15:41.771 --> 01:15:46.042 region:rollup2
OF OF A FILTER LESS HAND ROLLED

01:15:44.407 --> 01:15:47.076 region:rollup2
CIGARETTE* THAT THAT ARE OUT

01:15:46.042 --> 01:15:49.178 region:rollup2
THERE SO THIS IS JUST.

01:15:47.076 --> 01:15:50.579 region:rollup2
A PATTER.

01:15:49.178 --> 01:15:51.680 region:rollup2
IT'S A IT'S A IT'S A HABIT IT'S

01:15:50.579 --> 01:15:55.151 region:rollup2
PART OF THE HABIT IT'S.

01:15:51.680 --> 01:15:56.452 region:rollup2
IT'S A WAY OF LIFE.

01:15:55.151 --> 01:15:57.253 region:rollup2
WITH THE WORDS CAN HAVE TO.

01:15:56.452 --> 01:15:58.721 region:rollup2
AGREE TO DISAGREE ON THAT THE

01:15:57.253 --> 01:16:00.723 region:rollup2
SENSE LIKE.

01:15:58.721 --> 01:16:02.658 region:rollup2
I BELIEVE IF WE TOOK.

01:16:00.723 --> 01:16:04.126 region:rollup2
TWENTY CHP OFFICERS AND STARTED

01:16:02.658 --> 01:16:05.661 region:rollup2
HANDING OUT THOUSAND DOLLAR

01:16:04.126 --> 01:16:06.662 region:rollup2
FINES BY THE HUNDREDS AND LACKS

01:16:05.661 --> 01:16:08.030 region:rollup2
COUPLE MONTHS OF ALL THE SUDDEN

01:16:06.662 --> 01:16:09.198 region:rollup2
THERE'D BE A LOT LESS LETTERING

01:16:08.030 --> 01:16:10.933 region:rollup2
ON CAPITAL GRANTS.

01:16:09.198 --> 01:16:12.401 region:rollup2
DEPEND ON ME I WOULD HOPE SO

01:16:10.933 --> 01:16:14.403 region:rollup2
AND AND I WOULD ENLIST YOUR HELP

01:16:12.401 --> 01:16:16.672 region:rollup2
WITH CHP TO TO SEE IF THEY WILL

01:16:14.403 --> 01:16:18.074 region:rollup2
COME BACK. ON. THE END AND AT

01:16:16.672 --> 01:16:20.142 region:rollup2
THE END OF THE DAY.

01:16:18.074 --> 01:16:21.477 region:rollup2
I JUST THINK IT MAKES MORE SENSE

01:16:20.142 --> 01:16:22.912 region:rollup2
TO START WITH THE PERPETRATOR OF

01:16:21.477 --> 01:16:24.747 region:rollup2
THE LETTERING THAN IT DOES TO

01:16:22.912 --> 01:16:26.449 region:rollup2
PLACES BURDEN AT THE DOORSTEP OF

01:16:24.747 --> 01:16:28.317 region:rollup2
THE RETAILER. I'VE EXPRESSED

01:16:26.449 --> 01:16:29.652 region:rollup2
THAT TO YOU IN PRIOR DISCUSSIONS

01:16:28.317 --> 01:16:31.020 region:rollup2
ARE SUBJECT IRAQ REMAINS MY

01:16:29.652 --> 01:16:33.389 region:rollup2
OPINION.

01:16:31.020 --> 01:16:33.956 region:rollup2
AND I'D LIKE TO SEE S. AT LEAST

01:16:33.389 --> 01:16:35.558 region:rollup2
MOVE IN THAT DIRECTION AS A

01:16:33.956 --> 01:16:37.526 region:rollup2
FIRST STEP IN.

01:16:35.558 --> 01:16:38.761 region:rollup2
AS WE CONTINUE TO HAVE THIS

01:16:37.526 --> 01:16:39.728 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION ABOUT UNUSUAL

01:16:38.761 --> 01:16:41.063 region:rollup2
LETTERING WHICH CERTAINLY THE

01:16:39.728 --> 01:16:42.731 region:rollup2
GOAL IS SOMETHING.

01:16:41.063 --> 01:16:44.033 region:rollup2
WE'RE ALL IN AGREEMENT WITH.

01:16:42.731 --> 01:16:46.368 region:rollup2
ON FOR ALL THOSE REASONS ARE

01:16:44.033 --> 01:16:48.637 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDING A NO VOTE TODAY ON

01:16:46.368 --> 01:16:50.773 region:rollup2
ON THE BILL BEFORE US.

01:16:48.637 --> 01:16:51.874 region:rollup2
DO WE HAVE.

01:16:50.773 --> 01:16:54.844 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS I BELIEVE

01:16:51.874 --> 01:16:55.711 region:rollup2
MISTER LEVINE.

01:16:54.844 --> 01:16:57.012 region:rollup2
YEAH THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER

01:16:55.711 --> 01:16:58.147 region:rollup2
CHAIRMAN AND THANK YOU MISTER

01:16:57.012 --> 01:16:58.614 region:rollup2
STONE FOR THE BILL AND I JUST

01:16:58.147 --> 01:17:00.149 region:rollup2
WANNA THINK THE ENTIRE

01:16:58.614 --> 01:17:00.783 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE.

01:17:00.149 --> 01:17:01.851 region:rollup2
FOR THE THOUGHTFUL CONVERSATION

01:17:00.783 --> 01:17:03.219 region:rollup2
AND

01:17:01.851 --> 01:17:03.986 region:rollup2
A LOT OF FOR PERSPECTIVES ON

01:17:03.219 --> 01:17:05.788 region:rollup2
THIS ISSUE WHEN AND HOW TO

01:17:03.986 --> 01:17:06.288 region:rollup2
APPROACH IT.

01:17:05.788 --> 01:17:07.823 region:rollup2
AND.

01:17:06.288 --> 01:17:09.191 region:rollup2
I CERTAINLY HAVE WRESTLED WITH

01:17:07.823 --> 01:17:11.327 region:rollup2
THAT ISSUE.

01:17:09.191 --> 01:17:12.528 region:rollup2
IN MY OWN WAY AND THEN OF

01:17:11.327 --> 01:17:14.463 region:rollup2
COURSE WITHOUT PRIOR BELIEVE

01:17:12.528 --> 01:17:15.965 region:rollup2
YOUR SITE HAD A BILL OF MINE TO

01:17:14.463 --> 01:17:18.167 region:rollup2
SPANNING SMOKING ON ON BEACHES

01:17:15.965 --> 01:17:20.569 region:rollup2
AND PARKS THAT TARA WAS VETOED.

01:17:18.167 --> 01:17:23.405 region:rollup2
VERY RECENTLY.

01:17:20.569 --> 01:17:25.274 region:rollup2
JUST LAST MONTH BROUGHT MY

01:17:23.405 --> 01:17:26.542 region:rollup2
CHILDREN TO YOUR DISTRICT TO OF

01:17:25.274 --> 01:17:28.144 region:rollup2
THE SENATE CRUZ BOARDWALK.

01:17:26.542 --> 01:17:29.211 region:rollup2
AND THE FIRST THING MY NINE YEAR

01:17:28.144 --> 01:17:30.679 region:rollup2
OLD DAUGHTER ASKED ME WAS WHY

01:17:29.211 --> 01:17:32.982 region:rollup2
ARE THERE SO MANY CIGARETTES

01:17:30.679 --> 01:17:33.849 region:rollup2
IN THE SAN DAD.

01:17:32.982 --> 01:17:34.483 region:rollup2
AND I DID HAVE THE HEART TO TELL

01:17:33.849 --> 01:17:36.185 region:rollup2
HER.

01:17:34.483 --> 01:17:37.786 region:rollup2
IT'S BECAUSE SIDE THE GOVERNOR

01:17:36.185 --> 01:17:39.255 region:rollup2
VETOED MY BILL THAT WOULD HAVE

01:17:37.786 --> 01:17:41.023 region:rollup2
BANNED IT.

01:17:39.255 --> 01:17:41.924 region:rollup2
THOUGH I

01:17:41.023 --> 01:17:43.492 region:rollup2
THINK IF I HAVE A CHANCE

01:17:41.924 --> 01:17:45.361 region:rollup2
INTRODUCED HER TO HIM MAY BE OUT

01:17:43.492 --> 01:17:46.362 region:rollup2
TELLER. AT THAT POINT IN THE

01:17:45.361 --> 01:17:48.631 region:rollup2
CHAIN HIM.

01:17:46.362 --> 01:17:49.398 region:rollup2
FOR WHAT HE DID BUT I THINK THE

01:17:48.631 --> 01:17:51.600 region:rollup2
CHAIR.

01:17:49.398 --> 01:17:54.103 region:rollup2
ALSO RAISES SOME REALLY

01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:56.372 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT POINTS ABOUT HOW WE

01:17:54.103 --> 01:17:58.407 region:rollup2
POLICE OF THIS TYPE OF LITTER IN

01:17:56.372 --> 01:17:58.841 region:rollup2
THE CHALLENGES OF ENFORCEMENT.

01:17:58.407 --> 01:18:01.243 region:rollup2
AND.

01:17:58.841 --> 01:18:02.678 region:rollup2
IN WHILE WE THINK THAT WE HAVE

01:18:01.243 --> 01:18:04.480 region:rollup2
THE FORCE THAT WE NEED HERE AT

01:18:02.678 --> 01:18:05.881 region:rollup2
CAPITOL PARK. AND OF COURSE WITH

01:18:04.480 --> 01:18:07.016 region:rollup2
ALL THE CAMERAS AND SURVEILLANCE

01:18:05.881 --> 01:18:09.451 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAVE.

01:18:07.016 --> 01:18:10.019 region:rollup2
THAT THIS OP PERHAPS COULD BE A

01:18:09.451 --> 01:18:12.888 region:rollup2
NUISANCE THAT WE RAISE VERY

01:18:10.019 --> 01:18:15.491 region:rollup2
HIGH.

01:18:12.888 --> 01:18:17.026 region:rollup2
AND ENFORCE AT EVEN IF WE COULD

01:18:15.491 --> 01:18:19.295 region:rollup2
DO THAT IF IT WAS A NUISANCE

01:18:17.026 --> 01:18:20.863 region:rollup2
THAT THAT WENT THAT HIGH. ON NOT

01:18:19.295 --> 01:18:22.798 region:rollup2
EVERYWHERE IN CALIFORNIA DO WE

01:18:20.863 --> 01:18:25.234 region:rollup2
HAVE THE SURVEILLANCE AND THE

01:18:22.798 --> 01:18:26.368 region:rollup2
FORCE TO POLICE IT AT THE LEVEL

01:18:25.234 --> 01:18:27.603 region:rollup2
THAT WE COULD DREAM THAT WE

01:18:26.368 --> 01:18:28.871 region:rollup2
COULD DO HERE WE HAVE A LOT OF

01:18:27.603 --> 01:18:30.339 region:rollup2
OTHER PROBLEMS.

01:18:28.871 --> 01:18:31.240 region:rollup2
LIKE FIGHTS THAT TAKE PLACE AT

01:18:30.339 --> 01:18:32.908 region:rollup2
CAPITOL PARK.

01:18:31.240 --> 01:18:34.877 region:rollup2
THAT OCCURRED IN THE PAST YEAR

01:18:32.908 --> 01:18:35.911 region:rollup2
THAT WE ALSO NEED TO POLICE

01:18:34.877 --> 01:18:38.480 region:rollup2
IT'S KIND OF A HIGH NUISANCES

01:18:35.911 --> 01:18:40.182 region:rollup2
WELL. SO. YOU KNOW IT I'VE

01:18:38.480 --> 01:18:41.917 region:rollup2
LOOKED AT AT THIS A LOT I HAVE

01:18:40.182 --> 01:18:43.419 region:rollup2
LISTEN TO THIS DEBATE IN A LOT

01:18:41.917 --> 01:18:44.053 region:rollup2
OF THE CONVERSATIONS I'VE HEARD.

01:18:43.419 --> 01:18:45.387 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW REMIND ME OF OF SOME

01:18:44.053 --> 01:18:46.822 region:rollup2
OTHER YOU KNOW THAT THERE IS

01:18:45.387 --> 01:18:48.724 region:rollup2
SOME ANALOGIES OF.

01:18:46.822 --> 01:18:51.060 region:rollup2
HOW WE'VE DEALT WITH EMISSIONS

01:18:48.724 --> 01:18:52.962 region:rollup2
ON CARS AND THAT WE'VE TRIED TO

01:18:51.060 --> 01:18:53.529 region:rollup2
REGULATE EMISSIONS ON CARS IN A

01:18:52.962 --> 01:18:54.063 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT WAY THAT THE SAME

01:18:53.529 --> 01:18:55.798 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY YOU?

01:18:54.063 --> 01:18:57.032 region:rollup2
SWINGING

01:18:55.798 --> 01:18:58.500 region:rollup2
OTHER THINGS THAT WERE USED IN

01:18:57.032 --> 01:19:00.235 region:rollup2
THE PAST AREN'T APPROPRIATE NOW

01:18:58.500 --> 01:19:02.137 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THE HEALTH IMPACTS.

01:19:00.235 --> 01:19:03.172 region:rollup2
THAT WE I THINK YOU'VE ALSO

01:19:02.137 --> 01:19:04.506 region:rollup2
BEEN VERY THOUGHTFUL ABOUT THE

01:19:03.172 --> 01:19:05.641 region:rollup2
IMPACTS ON THE SMOKERS

01:19:04.506 --> 01:19:06.108 region:rollup2
THEMSELVES THE FIELD OR THE

01:19:05.641 --> 01:19:08.277 region:rollup2
TASTE.

01:19:06.108 --> 01:19:09.178 region:rollup2
.

01:19:08.277 --> 01:19:11.914 region:rollup2
WHICH I THINK YOU'RE YOU'RE IN

01:19:09.178 --> 01:19:13.882 region:rollup2
FACT EXTRAORDINARILY GENEROUS.

01:19:11.914 --> 01:19:16.118 region:rollup2
TO CONSIDER ADDED THOSE ISSUES

01:19:13.882 --> 01:19:18.687 region:rollup2
AS MUCH AS THAT BUT YOU'VE HAD.

01:19:16.118 --> 01:19:20.556 region:rollup2
I THINK OF THE FILTER.

01:19:18.687 --> 01:19:21.523 region:rollup2
AND IN WHAT CAN BE DONE TO MAKE

01:19:20.556 --> 01:19:23.058 region:rollup2
SURE SMOKERS KNOW WHAT'S THE

01:19:21.523 --> 01:19:24.126 region:rollup2
FRONT AND IN THE BACK END OF A

01:19:23.058 --> 01:19:26.061 region:rollup2
CIGARETTE.

01:19:24.126 --> 01:19:26.962 region:rollup2
IT'S A SIMPLE AS SIDE THEY DO

01:19:26.061 --> 01:19:28.230 region:rollup2
WITH RACE CARS.

01:19:26.962 --> 01:19:30.165 region:rollup2
YOU PUT A STICKER.

01:19:28.230 --> 01:19:31.900 region:rollup2
HEADLIGHT ON AND YOU PRETEND

01:19:30.165 --> 01:19:32.901 region:rollup2
THE RACE CAR HAS A HEADLIGHT YOU

01:19:31.900 --> 01:19:34.637 region:rollup2
CAN MAKE A CIGARETTE LOOK LIKE

01:19:32.901 --> 01:19:36.338 region:rollup2
IT HAS A FILTER SO SMOKER CAN

01:19:34.637 --> 01:19:37.373 region:rollup2
FIGURE OUT. WHICH SIDE THEY WANT

01:19:36.338 --> 01:19:38.907 region:rollup2
TO DRAW FROM.

01:19:37.373 --> 01:19:40.676 region:rollup2
IF THEY'RE HAVING A HARD TIME

01:19:38.907 --> 01:19:42.211 region:rollup2
WITH THAT. THERE ARE SOME OTHER

01:19:40.676 --> 01:19:43.412 region:rollup2
POINTS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED

01:19:42.211 --> 01:19:45.014 region:rollup2
THAT WE DO NEED TO CONTINUE TO

01:19:43.412 --> 01:19:46.415 region:rollup2
WORK THROUGH.

01:19:45.014 --> 01:19:48.183 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT YOU KNOW.

01:19:46.415 --> 01:19:49.818 region:rollup2
PERHAPS OR OTHER WAYS THAT WE

01:19:48.183 --> 01:19:52.354 region:rollup2
CAN DO ENFORCEMENT.

01:19:49.818 --> 01:19:54.123 region:rollup2
DATA WE CAN REGULATE AT THE END

01:19:52.354 --> 01:19:55.524 region:rollup2
OF THE WHOLESALER NOT JUST THE

01:19:54.123 --> 01:19:57.526 region:rollup2
RETAILER AS WELL. THE

01:19:55.524 --> 01:19:59.395 region:rollup2
MANUFACTURE COULD BE A POINT AT

01:19:57.526 --> 01:20:00.429 region:rollup2
WHICH WE ARE WERE WORKING TO

01:19:59.395 --> 01:20:02.498 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE THAT THEY DON'T COME

01:20:00.429 --> 01:20:04.166 region:rollup2
INTO. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

01:20:02.498 --> 01:20:06.402 region:rollup2
THAT WE CAN BE CREATIVE ABOUT

01:20:04.166 --> 01:20:08.871 region:rollup2
THOSE APPROACHES SO WE DON'T PUT

01:20:06.402 --> 01:20:10.873 region:rollup2
TOO MUCH OF A.

01:20:08.871 --> 01:20:12.574 region:rollup2
AN ONEROUS RESPONSIBILITY I

01:20:10.873 --> 01:20:13.142 region:rollup2
GUESS ON A RETAILER TO MAKE SURE

01:20:12.574 --> 01:20:13.942 region:rollup2
THAT THEY'RE NOT SELLING THE

01:20:13.142 --> 01:20:16.345 region:rollup2
WRONG.

01:20:13.942 --> 01:20:18.981 region:rollup2
PRODUCTS MAYBE LAST YEAR'S MODEL

01:20:16.345 --> 01:20:20.382 region:rollup2
THAT SOMEHOW MADE IT IN. OF BUT

01:20:18.981 --> 01:20:22.318 region:rollup2
I DON'T THINK I IF WE CLEAN UP

01:20:20.382 --> 01:20:24.119 region:rollup2
THE THE PRODUCT STREAM THAT WE

01:20:22.318 --> 01:20:25.354 region:rollup2
CAN HELP MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE

01:20:24.119 --> 01:20:27.289 region:rollup2
IS FOLLOWING THE LAW.

01:20:25.354 --> 01:20:29.525 region:rollup2
AS WE ADOPTED AS YOU FINE TUNE

01:20:27.289 --> 01:20:30.959 region:rollup2

SKATEBOARDING BEFORE I EVER

STARTED SERVING IN AND SO I

01:41:05.893 --> 01:41:08.930 region:rollup2
THINK THAT SKATEBOARDING

01:41:07.061 --> 01:41:10.231 region:rollup2
DESERVES AS PROPER RESPECT.

01:41:08.930 --> 01:41:11.432 region:rollup2

01:41:10.231 --> 01:41:13.034 region:rollup2
STATE OF CALIFORNIA GENERALLY

01:41:11.432 --> 01:41:14.835 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT YOU KNOW OUR

01:41:13.034 --> 01:41:15.469 region:rollup2
IDENTITY IN PEOPLE'S PERCEPTION

01:41:14.835 --> 01:41:16.470 region:rollup2
OF THE IDENTITY OF CALIFORNIANS

01:41:15.469 --> 01:41:17.905 region:rollup2
ARE.

01:41:16.470 --> 01:41:19.173 region:rollup2
SPORTS THAT DOES COME UP IS

01:41:17.905 --> 01:41:21.442 region:rollup2
SURFING ABOUT SKATEBOARDING I

01:41:19.173 --> 01:41:24.478 region:rollup2
THINK SERVING IS MORE IS MORE.

01:41:21.442 --> 01:41:25.713 region:rollup2
EMBLEMATIC OF OUR STATE AND OF

01:41:24.478 --> 01:41:27.448 region:rollup2
OUR CULTURE AND AND AND IF

YOU'LL SO MUCH MORE BECAUSE IT

01:41:27.448 --> 01:41:30.685 region:rollup2
NOT ONLY IS A HUGE ECONOMIC

01:41:29.383 --> 01:41:31.686 region:rollup2
DRIVER BUT IT ALSO SPEAKS TO THE

01:41:30.685 --> 01:41:33.087 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENT A LOT AND THEY THEY

01:41:31.686 --> 01:41:34.455 region:rollup2
TAKE ON A LOT OF ENVIRONMENTAL

01:41:33.087 --> 01:41:35.790 region:rollup2
CAUSES THAT WOULD MATTER A LOT

01:41:34.455 --> 01:41:37.892 region:rollup2
OF CALIFORNIANS. AND THEY'RE IN

01:41:35.790 --> 01:41:39.293 region:rollup2
THE CONVERSATION IT IT IS A LOT

01:41:37.892 --> 01:41:40.828 region:rollup2
BIGGER THAN JUST THE SPORT

01:41:39.293 --> 01:41:42.063 region:rollup2
ITSELF AND AND IMPACTS A LOT

01:41:40.828 --> 01:41:43.297 region:rollup2
MORE THAN JUST. THAN JUST PEOPLE

HAVING FUN AND THERE'S LOT OF

01:41:43.297 --> 01:41:45.933 region:rollup2
ECONOMIC IMPACTS IN THOSE LOT OF

01:41:44.799 --> 01:41:48.135 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENTS ON TAXES SO THAT'S

01:41:45.933 --> 01:41:51.639 region:rollup2
WHAT WE DO BELIEVE. THAT SERVING

01:41:48.135 --> 01:41:53.808 region:rollup2

WE WE HEAR TIME AND AGAIN ABOUT

01:49:08.375 --> 01:49:11.779 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT SPOTS WHO WHERE THE

01:49:10.444 --> 01:49:13.580 region:rollup2
LOCALS ARE PEOPLE THAT KNOW THAT

01:49:11.779 --> 01:49:14.515 region:rollup2
ONE SPOT. DON'T WANT THE PEOPLE

01:49:13.580 --> 01:49:16.517 region:rollup2
THERE.

01:49:14.515 --> 01:49:18.018 region:rollup2
AND THAT IS THE THE LEAST.

01:49:16.517 --> 01:49:20.454 region:rollup2
PROBABILITY THE LEAST

01:49:18.018 --> 01:49:22.689 region:rollup2
REPRESENTATIVE ATTITUDE OF OF

01:49:20.454 --> 01:49:24.491 region:rollup2
WHAT A TRUE SIR FOR IS.

01:49:22.689 --> 01:49:26.393 region:rollup2

01:49:26.393 --> 01:49:28.762 region:rollup2
EVERYONE AND EVERYONE IS WELCOME

01:49:28.195 --> 01:49:30.164 region:rollup2
IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF THIS

01:49:28.762 --> 01:49:31.298 region:rollup2
BILL.

01:49:30.164 --> 01:49:33.400 region:rollup2
YEAH AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE

01:49:31.298 --> 01:49:34.468 region:rollup2
A LOT OF MONEY TO DO IT IMMINENT

01:49:33.400 --> 01:49:36.370 region:rollup2
THREE OTHER THAN A STATE.

01:49:34.468 --> 01:49:37.704 region:rollup2
TO GO AND SERVE.

01:49:36.370 --> 01:49:39.706 region:rollup2
EIGHT YOU ANYBODY SO TO BE TOO

01:49:37.704 --> 01:49:41.041 region:rollup2

YOU THAT'S EXPENSIVE.

01:49:42.242 --> 01:49:45.212 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK RELATIVELY TO THE

01:49:44.044 --> 01:49:47.214 region:rollup2
OTHER SPORTS IT'S A LOT LESS

01:49:45.212 --> 01:49:48.782 region:rollup2
EXPENSIVE AND IT'S IT'S ACTION

YOU KNOW TO LEARN IT AND SETS IT

01:49:50.217 --> 01:49:53.153 region:rollup2

01:49:52.119 --> 01:49:54.922 region:rollup2
REALLY I WANT TO MAKE IS.

01:49:53.153 --> 01:49:56.590 region:rollup2
IF WE'RE PUSHIN THE SPORT AS

01:49:54.922 --> 01:49:58.392 region:rollup2
