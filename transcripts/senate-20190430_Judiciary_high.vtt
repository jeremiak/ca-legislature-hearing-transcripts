PROTECTED CLASS.

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:32.305
THESE TABLES ARE BASED UPON THE

00:04:32.372 --> 00:04:33.806
FEDERAL CENSUS AND DEPARTMENT OF

00:04:33.873 --> 00:04:35.642

ALONG RACE AND GENDER LINES

00:04:39.846 --> 00:04:41.247
BECAUSE HISTORICALLY

00:04:52.091 --> 00:04:52.792
SUBSTANTIALLY LOWER.

00:04:52.859 --> 00:04:55.795
THE PRACTICE IS UNCONSCIONABLE.

00:04:55.862 --> 00:04:57.930
BOND CONSTABLE IT GOES WITHOUT

00:04:57.997 --> 00:04:59.298
SAYING THE INDIVIDUALS SHOULD

00:04:59.365 --> 00:05:00.633

RACE OR GENDER.

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:05.271
AND YET THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT IS

00:05:05.338 --> 00:05:06.439
HAPPENING THE PLAINTIFFS IN

00:05:06.506 --> 00:05:08.741

THE PLANE IS THE ENACTED THIS

00:05:12.745 --> 00:05:13.212
INEQUITABLE AND REPUGNANT

00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:14.280

00:05:18.551 --> 00:05:19.619
IT'S DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTS

00:14:09.381 --> 00:14:11.183
ON LINE AND WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO

00:14:11.250 --> 00:14:12.484
DO WITH THIS MEASURE SOME

00:14:12.551 --> 00:14:14.153
DISHONEST MARKETING COMPANIES

00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:16.422
MANIPULATE THE INTERNET SEARCHES

00:14:16.488 --> 00:14:17.923

00:14:22.595 --> 00:14:23.963
INTO BELIEVING THAT THEY ARE

00:14:24.029 --> 00:14:25.164
PURCHASING A LOWEST PRICE

00:14:25.231 --> 00:14:26.966

00:14:27.032 --> 00:14:28.567
WHICH ISN'T THE CASE THIS IS

00:14:28.634 --> 00:14:29.501

THAT EXTRA MONEY SPENT BY

00:24:02.174 --> 00:24:03.842
PEOPLE DO THESE PHONY DEALS

00:24:03.909 --> 00:24:04.543
WHERE.

00:24:04.609 --> 00:24:05.944
USED A COUPLE YEARS AGO IN THIS

00:24:06.011 --> 00:24:07.379

OUT OF THE TICKET AND I'VE DONE

00:24:12.250 --> 00:24:12.918
A BUNCH OF THE STUFF INTERNET

00:24:12.984 --> 00:24:14.553
THE TO THE LEVEL AND RATE WHICH

00:24:14.619 --> 00:24:15.520
THE STUFF HAPPENING IS.

00:24:15.587 --> 00:24:17.823
PRETTY EXTRAORDINARY SO WHAT NO

00:24:17.889 --> 00:24:19.825
BUT IT'S A IT'S A GOOD IDEA.

00:24:19.891 --> 00:24:20.992
GOOD IDEA.

00:24:21.059 --> 00:24:23.829
SO NEXT YEAR THE HAVE A CLOSE IS

00:24:23.895 --> 00:24:24.663
MOSTLY THIS IS BECAUSE I HAD

00:24:24.729 --> 00:24:25.797
RUSSIAN.

00:24:25.864 --> 00:24:26.631
I'M SURE HAVE QUESTION -- SO I

00:24:26.698 --> 00:24:30.202
NOTED HERE THAT THERE IS A VERY --

00:24:30.268 --> 00:24:32.838
ROLE BUST PRIVATE RIGHT OF

00:24:32.904 --> 00:24:33.738
ACTION.

00:24:33.805 --> 00:24:34.806
WHICH SOME OF US BELIEVE ARE

00:24:34.873 --> 00:24:36.808
CRITICAL COMPONENTS TO ENFORCING

00:24:36.875 --> 00:24:38.844
RIGHTS WITHOUT THAT WITHOUT THE

00:24:38.910 --> 00:24:41.146
ABILITY TO FORCE OF RIGHT RELIEF

00:24:41.213 --> 00:24:42.714
WITHOUT A REMEDY IS NO RIGHT AT

00:24:42.781 --> 00:24:44.316
ALL SO I WONDER IF YOU COULD

00:24:44.382 --> 00:24:45.684
SHARE WITH US YOUR THINKING ON

00:24:45.750 --> 00:24:46.685
WHY.

00:24:46.751 --> 00:24:48.286
I IN THIS PARTICULAR INSTANCE

00:24:48.353 --> 00:24:49.754
YOU FELT THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF

00:24:49.821 --> 00:24:53.191
ACTION WAS APPROPRIATE.

00:24:53.258 --> 00:24:54.426
WELL I THINK THAT TO THESE ARE

00:24:54.492 --> 00:24:56.595
SMALL CONSUMER CASES BY AND

00:24:56.661 --> 00:24:58.363
LARGE YOU'VE GOTTA LOOK I JUST.

00:24:58.430 --> 00:24:59.497
THOUGHT IT WAS THE RIGHT THING

00:24:59.564 --> 00:25:00.265
TO DO I MEAN I THINK THAT YOU

00:25:00.332 --> 00:25:02.167
GOT A LOOK VARIOUS FACTORS UNDER

00:25:02.234 --> 00:25:04.603
VARIOUS CONDITIONS THIS WAS A

00:25:04.669 --> 00:25:04.803
GOOD.

00:25:04.870 --> 00:25:07.138
ONE ABOUT THAT.

00:25:07.205 --> 00:25:08.807
ALRIGHT WELL I KNEW I WAS

00:25:08.874 --> 00:25:09.608
GETTING SET UP ON THAT WITH THE

00:25:09.674 --> 00:25:11.176
STATE I I WAS REALLY LOOKING FOR

00:25:11.243 --> 00:25:14.546
CREATING HAD ROOMS I CAN PUT MY

00:25:14.613 --> 00:25:15.947
SERVICE TAX ON THESE TICKETS.

00:25:16.014 --> 00:25:16.715
WELL THAT'S ANOTHER COMMITTEE

00:25:16.781 --> 00:25:18.783
BUT IN THIS COMMITTEE --

00:25:18.850 --> 00:25:20.585
SERIOUSLY -- YOU KNOW BUT

00:25:20.652 --> 00:25:22.220
PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION IS BEEN

00:25:22.287 --> 00:25:24.789
A PRETTY CONTROVERSIAL TOPIC AND

00:25:24.856 --> 00:25:27.225
CONTINUES TO BE SO AND I'M JUST.

00:25:27.292 --> 00:25:28.727
CURIOUS AS TO WHY YOU FELT IT

00:25:28.793 --> 00:25:29.861
WAS APPROPRIATE IN THIS

00:25:29.928 --> 00:25:32.631
CIRCUMSTANCE TO PROVIDE OF

00:25:32.697 --> 00:25:34.165
VICTIMS OF THIS KIND OF

00:25:34.232 --> 00:25:37.269
FRAUDULENT BEHAVIOR TO BE ABLE --

00:25:37.335 --> 00:25:38.670
TO EXERCISE PRIVATE RIGHT OF

00:25:38.737 --> 00:25:40.505
ACTION.

00:25:40.572 --> 00:25:41.806
IF YOU COULD GIVE US YOUR TWENTY

00:25:41.873 --> 00:25:43.441
SMALL CASES THIS IS A SITUATION

00:25:43.508 --> 00:25:44.542
WHERE I THINK IT'S AN EFFECTIVE

00:25:44.609 --> 00:25:46.011
TOOL SOMETIMES IT IS SOMETIMES

00:25:46.077 --> 00:25:46.845
IT ISN'T.

00:25:46.912 --> 00:25:47.612
I THINK YOU JUST GENERALLY

00:25:47.679 --> 00:25:49.381
SMALLER COMPANIES THAT ARE OUT

00:25:49.447 --> 00:25:50.849
THERE DOING THIS KIND OF THING

00:25:50.916 --> 00:25:52.651
AND BY AND LARGE IT'S A IT'S AN

00:25:52.717 --> 00:25:53.952
EFFECTIVE TOOL WE WE USE AND THE

00:25:54.019 --> 00:25:56.321
PRIVACY BILL -- FOR PURPOSES OF

00:25:56.388 --> 00:25:59.891
VERY LARGE -- ISSUES AS IT

00:25:59.958 --> 00:26:02.527
RELATES -- TO WHAT'S IT CALLED

00:26:02.594 --> 00:26:03.962
THE THE RATE DATA BREACHES YOU

00:26:04.029 --> 00:26:05.463
KNOW WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS

00:26:05.530 --> 00:26:06.932
ISSUE FOR BOTTOM DOWN HAVE A

00:26:06.998 --> 00:26:08.433
DECADE YOU CAN TALK TO SOMEONE

00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:08.967
REPRESENTATIVES CONSUMER

00:26:09.034 --> 00:26:10.101
ATTORNEYS HERE.

00:26:10.168 --> 00:26:11.670
AND SOMETIMES IT WORKS AND THIS

00:26:11.736 --> 00:26:12.737
ONE I THINK THAT THESE ARE BY

00:26:12.804 --> 00:26:14.039
AND LARGE SMALL CASES THOUGH

00:26:14.105 --> 00:26:15.740
USUALLY SMALL PLAYERS.

00:26:15.807 --> 00:26:17.208
AND IT IN GRAYSON NECESSARY

00:26:17.275 --> 00:26:19.678
BALANCE I THINK TO MAKE SURE WE

00:26:19.744 --> 00:26:21.346
GET HIM OFF THE INTERNET.

00:26:21.413 --> 00:26:23.682
SO IT'S A IN SMALL CASES YOU

00:26:23.748 --> 00:26:25.550
THINK THIS IS APPROPRIATE.

00:26:25.617 --> 00:26:26.918
I THINK IN THIS PARTICULAR BILL

IF YOU WERE NOT GOING TO GET AN

00:26:35.226 --> 00:26:36.795
ANSWER THE QUESTION I THINK IT

00:26:36.861 --> 00:26:38.196
RAISES A GOOD POINT THOUGH AND I

00:26:38.263 --> 00:26:39.230
AND OBVIOUSLY THAT'S SOMETHING

00:26:39.297 --> 00:26:42.901
OF CONCERN TO ME THAT WE HAVE --

00:26:42.968 --> 00:26:44.736
OF CONSIDERABLY BROADER I CAN

00:26:44.803 --> 00:26:46.271
TAKE IT OUT OF YOUR MITCHELL.

00:26:46.338 --> 00:26:47.706
NO NO NO I THINK IT'S A GREAT

00:26:47.772 --> 00:26:49.140
IDEA I JUST WANT TO GET YOUR

00:26:49.207 --> 00:26:50.742
SENSE OF WHY YOU BOTHER TO PUT

00:26:50.809 --> 00:26:52.477

A REAL VALUE TO THE TIMES IN THE

00:27:17.369 --> 00:27:19.938

IT'S DESIGNED TO BASICALLY

00:43:03.681 --> 00:43:04.982
RETURNED THE STATUS QUO IT

00:43:05.049 --> 00:43:06.550
DOESN'T PREVENT THE PARK OWNER

00:43:06.617 --> 00:43:08.652
FROM RAISING RENTS IF THE PARK

00:43:08.719 --> 00:43:10.254
WOULD NEED TO DO THAT BECAUSE OF

00:43:10.321 --> 00:43:12.156
NEW INFRASTRUCTURE BEING NEEDED

TROLL -- ANY KIND OF A MUTUALLY

00:43:17.962 --> 00:43:19.863
ACCEPTABLE RENTAL AGREEMENT

00:43:19.930 --> 00:43:21.031
COULD BE NEGOTIATED.

00:43:21.098 --> 00:43:22.833
AND BASICALLY THE PART WOULD BE

00:43:22.900 --> 00:43:24.134
IN THE SAME POSITION IT WAS IN

00:43:24.201 --> 00:43:27.271
BEFORE THE FIRE WHICH WAS A

00:43:27.338 --> 00:43:28.072
COULD CHARGE WHATEVER IT WISHED.

00:43:28.138 --> 00:43:30.374
UNDER THE OTHER ALTERNATIVE IF

00:43:30.441 --> 00:43:31.775
THERE IS RANKING TROLL THEN THE

00:43:31.842 --> 00:43:33.277

IF THE PARK GOING TO BELIEVE NOW

00:43:37.748 --> 00:43:38.849

00:43:38.916 --> 00:43:40.751
INFRASTRUCTURE WITH THE PREVIOUS

00:43:40.818 --> 00:43:41.452
ROUND.

00:43:41.518 --> 00:43:44.021
ADD TO SECTION THREE THIS IS A

00:43:44.088 --> 00:43:45.723
VERY CRITICAL ISSUE.

00:43:45.789 --> 00:43:47.491
IN MY EXPERIENCE I CALLED.

00:43:47.558 --> 00:43:49.360

DEFINITION REALLY GIVEN TO THAT.

00:44:02.539 --> 00:44:03.307
AND SO WHAT'S HAPPENED OVER THE

00:44:03.374 --> 00:44:04.475
YEARS AS THE PARK OWNERS HAVE

00:44:04.541 --> 00:44:06.810

VICTIMS WHO LOST HOMES IN THE

CAMP FIRE LAST YEAR -- SO IT'S

00:47:27.044 --> 00:47:28.812
IT'S SOMETHING THAT THE TOUCHES

00:47:28.879 --> 00:47:30.747
A LITTLE CLOSE TO HOME AND AGAIN

00:47:30.814 --> 00:47:33.250
WE WE HAVE A LOT OF SINCERE

00:47:33.317 --> 00:47:33.850
SYMPATHY FOR IT.

00:47:33.917 --> 00:47:35.285
HOWEVER WE WE ACTUALLY SHARE THE

00:47:35.352 --> 00:47:37.054
CONCERNS THAT ARE NOTED IN YOUR

00:47:37.120 --> 00:47:38.088
ANALYSIS.

00:47:38.155 --> 00:47:40.157
THAT THAT THE RIGHT OF FIRST

00:47:40.224 --> 00:47:42.759
REFUSAL THAT'S INCLUDED IN SB

00:47:42.826 --> 00:47:43.227
TWO SEVENTY FOUR COULD

00:47:43.293 --> 00:47:44.361
POTENTIALLY ACTUALLY.

00:47:44.428 --> 00:47:46.096
I CREATE A DISINCENTIVE FOR PARK

00:47:46.163 --> 00:47:49.166
OWNERS TO REBUILD THEIR PARKS --

00:47:49.233 --> 00:47:51.235
THE IN SHORT WHAT THE WRITER

00:47:51.301 --> 00:47:53.036
FIRST OF REFUSAL REQUIRES IS

00:47:53.103 --> 00:47:55.305
THAT FORMER RESIDENTS BE GIVEN A

00:47:55.372 --> 00:47:56.440
SIX MONTH PERIOD IN WHICH THEY

00:47:56.506 --> 00:47:57.975
CAN RETURN TO THE PARK ONCE IT

00:47:58.041 --> 00:47:59.142
IS REBUILT.

00:47:59.209 --> 00:48:00.611
AND CLAIM.

00:48:00.677 --> 00:48:02.980
A SPOT UNDER THE SAME A TENANCY

00:48:03.046 --> 00:48:03.847
AGREEMENTS THAT THEY PREVIOUSLY

00:48:03.914 --> 00:48:06.283
HAD AS IS ACTUALLY NOTED BY THE

00:48:06.350 --> 00:48:07.985
PROPONENTS THE REALITY IS THAT.

00:48:08.051 --> 00:48:10.153
A POKE PARK OWNER IS ALSO THE

00:48:10.220 --> 00:48:11.488
VICTIM OF A WILDFIRE WHEN

00:48:11.555 --> 00:48:13.156
THEY'RE PARK IS DESTROYED THERE

00:48:13.223 --> 00:48:14.591
ARE A LOT OF COST ASSOCIATED

00:48:14.658 --> 00:48:15.359
WITH THE CLEAN UP THERE ARE A

00:48:15.425 --> 00:48:17.160
LOT OF COST ASSOCIATED WITH

00:48:17.227 --> 00:48:18.028
REBUILDING.

00:48:18.095 --> 00:48:19.429
AND A PARK WILL BE REBUILT WITH

00:48:19.496 --> 00:48:20.797
NEW INFRASTRUCTURE AND

00:48:20.864 --> 00:48:22.766
POTENTIALLY NEW AMENITIES AND SO

00:48:22.833 --> 00:48:24.368
AT THE END OF THE DAY THE THE

00:48:24.434 --> 00:48:26.737
RENTAL AGREEMENT THAT WAS MADE.

00:48:26.803 --> 00:48:28.405
WHEN A RESIDENT BECAME OR A

00:48:28.472 --> 00:48:30.240
TENANT OF THE PREVIOUS PARK THE

00:48:30.307 --> 00:48:32.409
PARK THAT WAS WAS DAMAGED AND

00:48:32.476 --> 00:48:33.644
BURNED DOWN A WILDFIRE?

00:48:33.710 --> 00:48:37.047
DOES NOT REFLECT THE ACTUAL COST

00:48:37.114 --> 00:48:38.515
AND THE MARKET VALUE OF THAT.

00:48:38.582 --> 00:48:40.884
OF THAT SPACE GOING FORWARD SO

00:48:40.951 --> 00:48:42.219
THE REALITY IS THAT THE RIGHT OF

00:48:42.286 --> 00:48:43.420
FIRST REFUSAL INCLUDED IN THE

00:48:43.487 --> 00:48:44.421
BILL.

00:48:44.488 --> 00:48:47.824
MIGHT POTENTIALLY REQUIRE APARK

00:48:47.891 --> 00:48:49.693
OWNER TO OFFER A SPACE EITHER AT

00:48:49.760 --> 00:48:50.994
AT A LOSS OR OR AT THE VERY

00:48:51.061 --> 00:48:52.095
LEAST.

00:48:52.162 --> 00:48:55.265
A BELOW MARKET RATE -- SO AGAIN

00:48:55.332 --> 00:48:56.833
THE ISSUE HERE IS THAT WHEN

00:48:56.900 --> 00:48:58.769
FACING THAT AS A PERSON WHO IS A

00:48:58.835 --> 00:49:03.106
VICTIM OF WILDFIRE AND ONE

00:49:03.173 --> 00:49:04.074
FACING THE COST OF REBUILDING.

00:49:04.141 --> 00:49:04.675
YOU MIGHT ACTUALLY CHOOSE. TO

00:49:04.741 --> 00:49:06.009
AVOID THE RISK OF OF HAVING TO

00:49:06.076 --> 00:49:07.477
DO THAT AND AVOID THE RISK OF

00:49:07.544 --> 00:49:11.214
HAVING FURTHER LOSS AND DID NOT-REBUILD THE PARK SO WE ARE

00:49:11.281 --> 00:49:12.783
CONCERNED AGAIN IS THAT.

00:49:12.849 --> 00:49:14.084
YOU WOULD CREATE A SITUATION IN

00:49:14.151 --> 00:49:16.219
WHICH A A PARK OWNER MAY CHOOSE

00:49:16.286 --> 00:49:17.754
NOT NOT TO REBUILD THANK YOU

00:49:17.821 --> 00:49:19.189
NEXT WITNESS.

00:49:19.256 --> 00:49:20.691
THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MY MY NAME

00:49:20.757 --> 00:49:23.060
IS JOE CARROLL -- MEMBERS THAT

00:49:23.126 --> 00:49:24.995
PRECEDED BEING AIRED THANK YOU

00:49:25.062 --> 00:49:25.696
FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK

00:49:25.762 --> 00:49:27.431
WITH YOU TODAY AND MY ACT I'M A

00:49:27.497 --> 00:49:28.632
LOCAL SACRAMENTO ATTORNEY I

00:49:28.699 --> 00:49:31.034
REPRESENT ABOUT A THOUSAND PARKS

00:49:31.101 --> 00:49:31.535
THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF

00:49:31.601 --> 00:49:34.304
CALIFORNIA -- I HAVE --

00:49:34.371 --> 00:49:36.106
OPPOSITION TO SECTIONS TWO AND

00:49:36.173 --> 00:49:36.840
THREE BUT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT

00:49:36.907 --> 00:49:39.676
SECTION THREE FIRST -- THIS

00:49:39.743 --> 00:49:40.744
RELATES TO SOME OF THE CHANGES

00:49:40.811 --> 00:49:43.413
THE CIVIL CODE SECTION SEVEN

00:49:43.480 --> 00:49:43.980
NINETY EIGHT SEVEN FOUR I AM

00:49:44.047 --> 00:49:45.949
CONCERNED THE CHANGES PROPOSED.

00:49:46.016 --> 00:49:47.918
MAY SEVEN PLACES CENTER WE COULD

00:49:47.984 --> 00:49:49.219
SEE AN INCREASE IN RESIDENTS

00:49:49.286 --> 00:49:51.088
DEFAULTING AND FAILING TO PAY

00:49:51.154 --> 00:49:52.155
SPACE RENT.

00:49:52.222 --> 00:49:53.190
THIS COULD ULTIMATELY RESULT IN

00:49:53.256 --> 00:49:54.591
A RESIDENT LOSING THEIR HOME

00:49:54.658 --> 00:49:55.859
WHICH IS CERTAINLY NOT AN

00:49:55.926 --> 00:49:57.294
OUTCOME ANYONE WANTS.

00:49:57.361 --> 00:49:58.962
AS THEIR VERSUS CALIFORNIA'S

00:49:59.029 --> 00:50:00.464
IT'S NOT SURPRISING THAT SOME

00:50:00.530 --> 00:50:02.032
MOBILE HOME PARK OWNERS MAY HAVE

00:50:02.099 --> 00:50:02.833
SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT STANDARDS

00:50:02.899 --> 00:50:04.668
DEPENDING ON WHERE THE PARK IS

00:50:04.735 --> 00:50:05.836
LOCATED.

00:50:05.902 --> 00:50:07.404
THAT BEING SAID ALL MOBILE HOME

00:50:07.471 --> 00:50:09.072
PARKS REQUIRED UNDER CURRENT LAW

00:50:09.139 --> 00:50:10.207
TO PUBLISH THEIR STANDARDS OF

00:50:10.273 --> 00:50:11.575
OCCUPANCY.

00:50:11.641 --> 00:50:12.442
AND MAKE THEM AVAILABLE TO

00:50:12.509 --> 00:50:13.477
POTENTIAL RESIDENTS OF THAT

00:50:13.543 --> 00:50:15.846
THERE IS NO MYSTERY TO THE

00:50:15.912 --> 00:50:16.446
PROCESS IN OTHER WORDS.

00:50:16.513 --> 00:50:17.948
IF YOU'RE SELLING A HOUSE THE

00:50:18.014 --> 00:50:19.483
PARK OWNERS REQUIRED TO GIVE YOU

00:50:19.549 --> 00:50:20.484
THEIR STANDARDS OF ARGUMENTS IN

00:50:20.550 --> 00:50:22.853
IT MAYBE THREE TO ONE OF MAYBE.

00:50:22.919 --> 00:50:23.687
FOUR TO ONE THEY MAY ALSO

00:50:23.754 --> 00:50:25.822
REQUIRE THAT THERE NOT BE ODD

00:50:25.889 --> 00:50:26.890
YOU KNOW YOU MIGHT HAVE A CREDIT

00:50:26.957 --> 00:50:28.358
SCORE BUT IT'S ALL CONSIDERED

00:50:28.425 --> 00:50:30.193
TOGETHER.

00:50:30.260 --> 00:50:32.429
AND SO THIS IS AN IMPORTANT --

00:50:32.496 --> 00:50:34.131
DESERT THESE STANDARDS ARE IN

00:50:34.197 --> 00:50:35.766
THERE TO ENSURE THAT -- THERE TO

00:50:35.832 --> 00:50:36.733
BE ACTUALLY APPLIED TO ALL

00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:38.268
INTERESTED PARTIES BY

00:50:38.335 --> 00:50:39.469
ARBITRARILY LOWERING THE

00:50:39.536 --> 00:50:40.637
STANDARDS REDUCING ONE OWNER

00:50:40.704 --> 00:50:42.339
CONSIDER WHEN APPROVING A RESIN

00:50:42.406 --> 00:50:43.940
FOR TENDENCY. FOR EXAMPLE

00:50:44.007 --> 00:50:45.542
REQUIRED APART TO ACCEPT OR

00:50:45.609 --> 00:50:46.777
PROVE APPLICANTS WHO EITHER HAVE

00:50:46.843 --> 00:50:49.913
LESS INCOME AND OR BAD CREDIT.

00:50:49.980 --> 00:50:50.881
IT'S FORESEEABLE THAT THIS COULD

00:50:50.947 --> 00:50:51.748
LEAD TO MORE OBJECTIONS WARS

00:50:51.815 --> 00:50:53.183
HAVE MORE PEOPLE COMING LOSING

00:50:53.250 --> 00:50:55.819
THEIR HOME. ONE WHERE I'M NOT

00:50:55.886 --> 00:50:57.053
AWARE OF ANY MAJOR ISSUES WITHIN

00:50:57.120 --> 00:50:58.822
THE INDUSTRY RIGHT NOW RELATED

00:50:58.889 --> 00:51:00.290
TO THE APPLICATION PROCESS AND A

00:51:00.357 --> 00:51:01.691
RESIDENCY STANDARDS.

00:51:01.758 --> 00:51:03.827
IF THE COMMITTEE DOES CHOOSE TO

00:51:03.894 --> 00:51:04.394
MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS BILL

00:51:04.461 --> 00:51:05.228
TODAY.

00:51:05.295 --> 00:51:06.396
I WOULD SUGGEST CHANGES TO BE

00:51:06.463 --> 00:51:08.198
MADE THE CIVIL CODE SECTION

00:51:08.265 --> 00:51:09.199
SEVEN NINETY EIGHT SOME FOR D.

00:51:09.266 --> 00:51:12.035
AND FOR TWO SEVEN NINETY EIGHT

00:51:12.102 --> 00:51:13.203
SOME FOR DE TO TO BE ELIMINATED

00:51:13.270 --> 00:51:16.273
IN ITS ENTIRETY -- IT.

00:51:16.339 --> 00:51:18.175
IN REGARDS TO CIVIL CODE SECTION

00:51:18.241 --> 00:51:20.410
SEVEN NINETY EIGHT SOME.

00:51:20.477 --> 00:51:21.511
FOR REGARDLESS OF WHERE THE PARK

00:51:21.578 --> 00:51:24.114
IS LOCATED IF THE BILL GOES INTO

00:51:24.181 --> 00:51:27.150
LAW AS IT CURRENTLY STATES --

00:51:27.217 --> 00:51:28.151
REGARDLESS OF WHERE THE PARK IS

00:51:28.218 --> 00:51:29.586
LOCATED OF ITS ON THE OCEAN WHAT

00:51:29.653 --> 00:51:30.787
AMENITIES IT OFFERS.

00:51:30.854 --> 00:51:32.923
IF EVERYONE IS REQUIRED TO GO BY

00:51:32.989 --> 00:51:35.592
THE THREE TO ONE RATIO -- I SEE

00:51:35.659 --> 00:51:37.761
TO CONCERNS OF WHAT COULD OCCUR --

00:51:37.828 --> 00:51:39.229
COULD YOU WRAP IT UP VERY

00:51:39.296 --> 00:51:40.831
QUICKLY I WILL SO THE UNDER THE

00:51:40.897 --> 00:51:43.934
UNDER CURRENT STANDARDS -- ONE

00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:45.368
OF OUR CONCERNS IS THAT WITH THE

00:51:45.435 --> 00:51:46.603
LOAN PROVISION WHERE IF YOU

00:51:46.670 --> 00:51:47.204
AUTOMATICALLY QUALIFY FOR BANK

00:51:47.270 --> 00:51:48.538
LOAN.

00:51:48.605 --> 00:51:49.973
IT'S NOT SPECIFIC ENOUGH I MEAN

00:51:50.040 --> 00:51:50.874
NOT FAMILY MEMBER COULD LOAN

00:51:50.941 --> 00:51:52.409
MONEY AND THEREFORE THEY WERE

00:51:52.476 --> 00:51:54.311
AUTOMATICALLY QUALIFIED WE THINK

00:51:54.377 --> 00:51:54.911
THAT.

00:51:54.978 --> 00:51:57.247
AS THE CITY THAT PROVISION

00:51:57.314 --> 00:51:57.814
SHOULD BE ELIMINATED IN ITS

00:51:57.881 --> 00:51:58.682
ENTIRETY.

00:51:58.748 --> 00:52:00.817
AND THAT WE BE ALLOWED TO LOOK

00:52:00.884 --> 00:52:01.751
AT BOTH.

00:52:01.818 --> 00:52:03.453
INCOME STANDARDS AND CREDIT

00:52:03.520 --> 00:52:05.755
SCORES AND NOT ONE OR THE OTHER

00:52:05.822 --> 00:52:06.890
SO IF YOU HAVE CREDIT.

00:52:06.957 --> 00:52:07.858
BECAUSE IT'S EASY TO SEE A

TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT WHAT WHAT

00:55:22.285 --> 00:55:23.353
WHEN YOU'VE GOT PEOPLE THAT HAVE

KNOW THE YEAH OF THE AL GOOD

00:55:35.031 --> 00:55:36.966
SOMEBODY'S CREDIT IS A AHEAD OF

TIME IS.

00:55:38.201 --> 00:55:40.470
YOUR EXAMPLE I THINK WAS IN TUNE

00:55:40.537 --> 00:55:42.939

TIME I THINK THAT'S AN

00:56:02.692 --> 00:56:04.160
OPPORTUNITY THAT THEY SHOULD

00:56:04.227 --> 00:56:05.428

A GOOD JOB RECOGNIZING THERE'S

00:59:02.505 --> 00:59:03.139
STILL WORK TO BE DONE ON THIS

00:59:03.206 --> 00:59:05.675

00:59:05.742 --> 00:59:05.875
ARE.

00:59:05.942 --> 00:59:08.144
THAT THIS IS STILL NEEDING SOME

00:59:08.211 --> 00:59:09.479

00:59:09.545 --> 00:59:13.149
BASICALLY WE DON'T WANT. TO SEE

00:59:13.216 --> 00:59:15.018
PEOPLE WHO HAVE.

00:59:15.084 --> 00:59:17.020
OF HAD MOBILE HOMES HAVE BEEN

00:59:25.128 --> 00:59:27.030

PARK OWNERS REBUILDING BUT

00:59:29.499 --> 00:59:30.667
HAVING TO BASICALLY LEAVE

CERTAIN EXPENSES THE SAME WAY

00:59:33.069 --> 00:59:35.471
THERE'S INSURANCE THAT COMES IN --

00:59:35.538 --> 00:59:37.473
THEY'RE ALL SORTS OF FACTORS

00:59:37.540 --> 00:59:40.777

PENALTY.

00:59:49.719 --> 00:59:51.287

SENATE BILL THREE TWO NINE WOULD

NOT REQUIRE THAT LANDLORDS RENT

TO SUBSIDIZE TENANTS.

01:05:22.885 --> 01:05:25.154
LANDLORDS SIMPLY WOULD HAVE TO

ADVERTISEMENTS FOR APARTMENTS

01:06:39.962 --> 01:06:41.030
THAT A FAMILY WITH HOUSING

01:06:41.097 --> 01:06:42.898
ASSISTANCE COULD AFFORD THERE

01:06:42.965 --> 01:06:44.700
WAS ONLY ONE THAT DID NOT

EXPLICITLY PROHIBIT VOUCHER

01:06:47.069 --> 01:06:48.804
HOLDERS FROM APPLYING.

01:06:48.871 --> 01:06:50.106
WHERE SOURCE OF INCOME

01:06:50.172 --> 01:06:52.541
PROTECTIONS WERE NOT IN PLACE

01:06:52.608 --> 01:06:54.143
DENIAL RATES FOR ASSISTED

01:06:54.210 --> 01:06:56.679
FAMILIES WERE AS HIGH AS 75% OR

01:06:56.746 --> 01:06:58.180
MORE?

01:06:58.247 --> 01:06:59.682
IN JURISDICTIONS WHERE THE

01:06:59.749 --> 01:07:01.384
SOURCE OF INCOME PROTECTIONS

01:07:01.450 --> 01:07:03.386
THIS DID NOT RATE WAS ALMOST CUT

01:07:03.452 --> 01:07:05.054
IN HALF.

01:07:05.121 --> 01:07:07.523
THIS SITUATION IS UNACCEPTABLE

01:07:07.590 --> 01:07:09.291
IF WE FIND OUR FOUNDER CELLS FOR

01:07:09.358 --> 01:07:12.027
EXAMPLE FACING DATA THAT 75% OF

01:07:16.132 --> 01:07:18.033
IT TO BUY FOOD.

01:07:18.100 --> 01:07:19.635
WE WOULD CRY FOUL.

01:07:19.702 --> 01:07:20.836
WE SHOULD NOT ACCEPT THE

01:07:20.903 --> 01:07:22.104
SITUATION FOR THE HOUSING

01:07:22.171 --> 01:07:23.572
ASSISTANCE WE GIVE ARE STRICTLY

01:07:23.639 --> 01:07:25.741
RESIDENTS EITHER ESPECIALLY WHEN

01:07:25.808 --> 01:07:27.977
THERE'S A PROVEN POLICY

01:07:28.043 --> 01:07:29.645
AVAILABLE TO CORRECT IT.

01:07:29.712 --> 01:07:31.347
THE HOUSING CRISIS IS IT HARD

01:07:31.414 --> 01:07:33.082
FOR LOW INCOME RENTERS RISING

01:07:33.149 --> 01:07:34.617
RENTS LACK OF AVAILABLE

01:07:34.683 --> 01:07:36.652
AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND STAGNANT

01:07:36.719 --> 01:07:38.654
INCOMES MAKES ITS POPULATION THE

01:07:38.721 --> 01:07:41.023
MOST SUSCEPTIBLE TO FALLING INTO

01:07:41.090 --> 01:07:42.892
HOMELESSNESS.

01:07:42.958 --> 01:07:44.693
YOU ARE COLLEAGUES AND THE

01:07:44.760 --> 01:07:46.462
COMMITTEE HAVE RECEIVED A NUMBER

01:07:46.529 --> 01:07:48.597
OF LETTERS OF OPPOSITION AND

01:07:48.664 --> 01:07:49.865
SOME CONCERNS I'M SURE WE'LL

01:07:49.932 --> 01:07:50.933
HEAR TODAY.

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:52.701
AND SO I WANTED TO ADDRESS THE

01:07:52.768 --> 01:07:54.203
MAGICALLY SOME OF THE MAJOR --

01:07:54.270 --> 01:07:56.839
CONCERNS RAISED IN AND CHALLENGE --

01:07:56.906 --> 01:07:59.041
THEIR POSITION.

01:07:59.108 --> 01:08:00.743
LET ME CLARIFY THAT THIS BILL

01:08:00.810 --> 01:08:03.312
WILL NOT INCREASE THE NUMBER OF

01:08:03.379 --> 01:08:05.114
VOUCHERS IN THE MARKET.

01:08:05.181 --> 01:08:07.383
NOR REQUIRED THAT ALL LANDLORDS

01:08:07.450 --> 01:08:08.384
EXCEPT EVERY VOUCHER HOLDEN

01:08:08.451 --> 01:08:09.485
APPLICANT.

01:08:09.552 --> 01:08:11.187
THE BILL REQUIRES LANDLORDS TO

01:08:11.253 --> 01:08:13.422
ALLOW ASSISTANT RESIDENTS TO

01:08:13.489 --> 01:08:15.424
APPLY WHILE ALSO ALLOWING THEM

01:08:15.491 --> 01:08:17.693
TO RE APPLY TO EXCUSE ME TO

01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:19.361
APPLY THEIR RENTAL CRITERIA. TO

01:08:19.428 --> 01:08:20.930
ACCEPT TO DENY A FAMILY WITH

01:08:20.996 --> 01:08:23.599
ASSISTANCE IN THE SAME WAY THEY

01:08:23.666 --> 01:08:24.333
WOULD ANY OTHER FAMILY.

01:08:24.400 --> 01:08:25.734
BECAUSE THE BILL DOES NOT

01:08:25.801 --> 01:08:27.369
INCREASE THE NUMBER OF VOUCHERS

01:08:27.436 --> 01:08:29.238
WE DON'T THINK IT WILL INCREASE

01:08:29.305 --> 01:08:31.507
ADMINISTRATIVE BURDENS FOR HOUSE

01:08:31.574 --> 01:08:32.074
FOR THE HOUSING AUTHORITIES

01:08:32.141 --> 01:08:34.710
ACROSS THE STATE.

01:08:34.777 --> 01:08:36.212
IF ANYTHING HOUSING AUTHORITIES

01:08:36.278 --> 01:08:37.646
WILL BENEFIT FROM THE FACT THAT

01:08:37.713 --> 01:08:39.582
FAMILY WILL BE MORE LIKELY TO

01:08:39.648 --> 01:08:41.016
SUCCESSFULLY USED THEIR VOUCHER

01:08:41.083 --> 01:08:42.384
RATHER THAN RETURNING IT WHEN IT

01:08:42.451 --> 01:08:44.253
EXPIRES ON THE HOUSING AUTHORITY

01:08:44.320 --> 01:08:46.355
BEING FORCED TO REPROCESS A RE

01:08:46.422 --> 01:08:47.490
ISSUE THE VOUCHER.

01:08:47.556 --> 01:08:48.491
WE'RE PLEASED TO HAVE THE

01:08:48.557 --> 01:08:49.725
CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF

01:08:49.792 --> 01:08:51.227
HOUSING AUTHORITIES AS A CO

01:08:51.293 --> 01:08:53.863
SPONSOR OF THIS MEASURE.

01:08:53.929 --> 01:08:55.431
FURTHER THE BILL DOES NOT

01:08:55.498 --> 01:08:56.632
DICTATE WHAT LANDLORDS MAKE

01:08:56.699 --> 01:08:58.767
CHARGE FOR RENT.

01:08:58.834 --> 01:09:00.336
IF AN ASSISTED FAMILIES ABLE TO

01:09:00.402 --> 01:09:01.737
AFFORD THE RENT BEING CHARGED

01:09:01.804 --> 01:09:03.939
THE BILL ALLOWS THEM TO APPLY

01:09:04.006 --> 01:09:06.175
BUT DOES NOT FORCE LANDLORDS TO

01:09:06.242 --> 01:09:08.544
RENT ANY SPECIFIC LEVEL OR TO

01:09:08.611 --> 01:09:10.312
COMPLY WITH SECTION EIGHT

01:09:10.379 --> 01:09:14.984
PAYMENT STANDARDS.

01:09:15.050 --> 01:09:16.418
WHEN SOMEONE SECTION EIGHT

01:09:16.485 --> 01:09:17.586
VOUCHER APPLIES FOR DEPARTMENT

01:09:17.653 --> 01:09:18.587
BECAUSE THE APARTMENT IS

01:09:18.654 --> 01:09:20.890
INSPECTED TO MAKE SURE IT MEETS

01:09:20.956 --> 01:09:22.224
BASIC REQUIREMENTS?

01:09:22.291 --> 01:09:23.526
WE UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS A

01:09:23.592 --> 01:09:25.895
CONCERN THAT THAT MIGHT CAUSE A

01:09:25.961 --> 01:09:28.364
UNTENABLE DELAY FOR THE LANDLORD.

01:09:28.430 --> 01:09:29.665
THE HOUSING AUTHORITY LOS

01:09:29.732 --> 01:09:31.400
ANGELES IS WORKING TO REDUCE THE

01:09:31.467 --> 01:09:33.702
TIME FOR INSPECTION FOR EXAMPLE

01:09:33.769 --> 01:09:35.704
FROM WHAT THEY REPORT TO BE THE

01:09:35.771 --> 01:09:37.840
CURRENTLY ONE WEEK.

01:09:37.907 --> 01:09:39.875
THE INSPECTION SHOULD NOT BE

01:09:39.942 --> 01:09:41.410
VIEWED AS A BURDEN SINCE IT IS

01:09:41.477 --> 01:09:43.112
PERFORMED TO MAKE LANDLORDS

01:09:43.178 --> 01:09:44.847
COMPLY WITH THEIR EXISTING LEGAL

01:09:44.914 --> 01:09:46.615
OBLIGATIONS FOR PROVIDING

01:09:46.682 --> 01:09:48.083
HEALTHY HOUSING FOR ALL THEIR

01:09:48.150 --> 01:09:50.319
TENANTS.

01:09:50.386 --> 01:09:52.321
LASTLY THERE WAS A CONCERN

01:09:52.388 --> 01:09:54.056
EXPRESSED ABOUT -- INSURANCE

01:09:54.123 --> 01:09:56.759
PREMIUMS AND IF THEY WOULD BE

01:09:56.825 --> 01:09:58.294
THEY THEY WOULD UNDULY INCREASE.

01:09:58.360 --> 01:09:59.261
INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE

01:09:59.328 --> 01:10:01.263
CURRENTLY BARRED FROM ASKING FOR

01:10:01.330 --> 01:10:02.464

HOUSING ASSISTANCE IS ACCEPTED

01:10:04.400 --> 01:10:05.801
BY A PROPERTY OWNER.

01:10:05.868 --> 01:10:07.937
THERE WAS A BILL -- PREVIOUSLY A

01:10:08.003 --> 01:10:09.905
MAIENSCHEIN BILL -- THAT COVERED

01:10:09.972 --> 01:10:11.707
THIS ISSUE BUT AGAIN LET ME BE

01:10:11.774 --> 01:10:13.208
CLEAR.

01:10:13.275 --> 01:10:15.311
UNDER CURRENT LAW.

01:10:15.377 --> 01:10:16.912
INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE BARRED

01:10:16.979 --> 01:10:19.014
FROM EVEN ASKING THE QUESTION

01:10:19.081 --> 01:10:20.449
ABOUT WHETHER HOUSING ASSISTANCE

01:10:20.516 --> 01:10:21.650
IS ACCEPTED BY THE PROPERTY

01:10:21.717 --> 01:10:24.019
OWNER.

01:10:24.086 --> 01:10:25.621
CALLING THE ORIGINAL PURPOSE OF

01:10:25.688 --> 01:10:27.456
HOUSING VOUCHERS WAS TO HELP

PEOPLE ATTAIN AFFORDABLE HOUSING

01:10:28.924 --> 01:10:30.125
AND ENABLE FAMILIES AND

01:10:30.192 --> 01:10:31.460

HIGH POVERTY.

01:10:34.630 --> 01:10:37.066
AREAS WITH GREATER OPPORTUNITIES.

01:10:37.132 --> 01:10:39.201
RESEARCH DEMONSTRATES WHY THIS

01:10:39.268 --> 01:10:41.103
IS -- A VALUABLE WAY TO HAVE

01:10:41.170 --> 01:10:43.005
DIVERSE COMMITTEES FOR A VARIETY

ALTHOUGH INTERNALLY I WAS

I WAS STILL VERY GRATEFUL.

01:11:56.111 --> 01:11:57.446
MY HOPE WAS THAT I WOULD BE ABLE

01:11:57.513 --> 01:11:58.514

01:14:41.543 --> 01:14:42.778
THE WAY THE PROGRAM WORKS IS

01:14:42.845 --> 01:14:44.213
THAT OF AFTER HOLDER MUST FIND A

THE REST OF THE RENT DIRECTLY TO

01:14:59.394 --> 01:15:00.395

01:15:00.462 --> 01:15:00.963
IN PART TO THE COMPETITIVE

01:15:01.029 --> 01:15:02.598
RENTAL MARKETS IN MANY PARTS

01:15:02.664 --> 01:15:04.466
AROUND OUR STATE THE REALITY IS

01:15:04.533 --> 01:15:06.501
NOW THAT FAMILIES ARE UNABLE TO

01:15:06.568 --> 01:15:08.604
USE THEIR VOUCHERS I'M SIMPLY

01:15:08.670 --> 01:15:09.338

EVEN HAVE A CHANCE TO APPLY.

01:15:15.978 --> 01:15:17.479
THIS IS A HUGE PROBLEM FOR MANY

01:15:17.546 --> 01:15:19.481
REASONS FIRST AND MOST IMPORTANT

01:15:19.548 --> 01:15:21.049
IT CAUSES MANY FAMILIES TO

01:15:21.116 --> 01:15:23.518
RETURN THE HIGH POVERTY AREAS

01:15:23.585 --> 01:15:24.753
AND WE'RE REMAIN HOMELESS.

01:15:24.820 --> 01:15:26.922
IT ALSO MEANS THAT CALIFORNIA IS

01:15:26.989 --> 01:15:29.091
NOT RECEIVING THE FULL BENEFIT

01:15:29.157 --> 01:15:30.759
FROM THE FEDERAL SUBSIDIES IT

01:15:30.826 --> 01:15:32.427

FOLLOW THE RULES IT THAT IS NOT

01:21:22.010 --> 01:21:23.545
THE ISSUE I THINK THE CHALLENGE

THAT THAT MANY OWNERS FIND IS.

01:21:26.114 --> 01:21:27.382

01:21:32.887 --> 01:21:33.455
MANY THE HOUSING AUTHORITIES ARE

01:21:33.521 --> 01:21:36.458

OWNERS THROUGH A TIGHT TO TAX

01:21:41.997 --> 01:21:44.466
CREDITS -- AND SOME SORT OF

01:21:44.532 --> 01:21:46.201
EDUCATION PROCESS BECAUSE OF

01:21:46.268 --> 01:21:47.535
COURSE HOUSING AUTHORITIES DON'T

01:21:47.602 --> 01:21:49.237
NECESSARILY HAVE THE TIME TO

01:21:49.304 --> 01:21:50.905
PROVIDE THE EDUCATION THAT MANY

01:21:50.972 --> 01:21:52.340

THE LENGTHY -- CONTRACTS AND IF

01:21:55.310 --> 01:21:57.512
WE COULD FIND A WAY TO SHORTEN

01:21:57.579 --> 01:21:59.381
UP THIS INSPECTION PROCESS SO

01:21:59.447 --> 01:22:07.355

01:22:09.190 --> 01:22:09.791
RENT AND TIME I THINK THAT WOULD

01:22:09.858 --> 01:22:10.625
BE EXTREMELY HELPFUL IF THE

01:22:10.692 --> 01:22:11.192

PEOPLE THAT TALK ABOUT THE FACT

01:26:12.200 --> 01:26:13.134
THAT THEIR RENT WENT UP A 100%.

01:26:13.201 --> 01:26:13.868

MAY.

01:32:38.686 --> 01:32:39.921
CERTAINLY THE HABITABILITY AND

01:32:39.987 --> 01:32:41.722
SHE WAS THE BASELINE BUT ABOVE

01:32:41.789 --> 01:32:44.025
THAT.

01:32:44.091 --> 01:32:46.661
IS THERE A DISTINCTION.

01:32:46.727 --> 01:32:47.628

THERE RIGHT IN LINE WITH THE

01:33:04.445 --> 01:33:05.179
HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE AND

01:33:05.246 --> 01:33:06.914
FRANKLY I THINK IT'S GREAT THAT

01:33:06.981 --> 01:33:07.682
THOSE UNITS ARE GETTING

01:33:46.253 --> 01:33:46.954
LANDLORDS THAT ARE ALREADY

01:33:47.021 --> 01:33:48.823

DIGITALLY PRODUCED SEXUALLY

01:41:05.793 --> 01:41:08.462
EXPLICIT MATERIAL A CIVIL CAUSE

01:41:08.529 --> 01:41:11.165

OPEN COURT FOR ECONOMIC.

01:41:12.833 --> 01:41:15.302
REPUTATIONAL AND EMOTIONAL HARM.

01:41:15.369 --> 01:41:17.671
MEMBERS NEW DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES

01:41:17.738 --> 01:41:19.406
ALLOW CONTENT CREATORS TO

MANIPULATE IMAGES TO DEPICT

01:41:21.275 --> 01:41:23.277

CONSENT OR PARTICIPATION.

01:41:29.650 --> 01:41:30.784
FILMMAKERS CAN ALSO USE THIS

01:41:30.851 --> 01:41:33.454
TECHNOLOGY IN MAINSTREAM CONTENT

01:41:33.520 --> 01:41:35.823
TO DEPICT ACTOR OR ACTRESS AS

ENGAGING IN SEXUAL ACTIVITY

WITHOUT MEANINGFUL CONSENT.

01:41:41.995 --> 01:41:43.297
THIS FORM OF DIGITAL DOUBLING

01:41:43.363 --> 01:41:45.999
DOUBLING CAN CAUSE ENORMOUS HARM.

01:41:46.066 --> 01:41:47.167
EVEN THOUGH THE AUDIO VISUAL

01:41:47.234 --> 01:41:48.435
WORK DOES NOT SHOW THE

01:41:48.502 --> 01:41:50.471
PERFORMERS ACTUAL INTIMATE BODY

01:41:50.537 --> 01:41:52.206
PARTS.

01:41:52.272 --> 01:41:53.640
IN MOST PRODUCTION THE MOST

01:41:53.707 --> 01:41:55.776
EXCUSE ME IN POST PRODUCTION THE

01:41:55.843 --> 01:41:57.744
MAKERS NOW HAVE TOOLS TO REMOVE

01:41:57.811 --> 01:41:58.645
UNDERWEAR.

01:41:58.712 --> 01:42:00.547
CREATE A DIGITAL REPLICA OF THE

01:42:00.614 --> 01:42:03.250
PERSON OR TO REPLACE THE HEAD OF

01:42:03.317 --> 01:42:05.285
A PERFORMER ON THE REAL BODY OF

01:42:05.352 --> 01:42:06.553
ANOTHER.

01:42:06.620 --> 01:42:08.088
UNFORTUNATELY SOME PERFORMERS

01:42:08.155 --> 01:42:09.456
HAVE SUFFERED AT THE HANDS OF

01:42:09.523 --> 01:42:10.657
THIS TECHNOLOGY IN FILM

01:42:10.724 --> 01:42:12.125
PRODUCTION.

01:42:12.192 --> 01:42:13.460
AND THE PROBLEM WILL ONLY INTESA

01:42:13.527 --> 01:42:15.329
INTENSIFY AS THIS TECHNOLOGY

01:42:15.395 --> 01:42:18.765
BECOMES MORE ADVANCED AND FREELY

01:42:18.832 --> 01:42:20.000
ACCESSIBLE.

01:42:20.067 --> 01:42:20.868
THIS FORM OF ONLINE SEXUAL ABUSE

01:42:20.934 --> 01:42:23.103
OF INDIVIDUALS MOSTLY WOMEN IS

01:42:23.170 --> 01:42:24.438
VERY TROUBLING.

01:42:24.505 --> 01:42:26.907
THERE ARE PRESENTLY OVER FIVE

01:42:26.974 --> 01:42:28.509
THOUSAND NON CONSENSUAL PORN

01:42:28.575 --> 01:42:31.278
SITES PORN VIDEOS BEING MONETIZE

01:42:31.345 --> 01:42:33.146
ON PORN WEBSITES AND THE

01:42:33.213 --> 01:42:34.381
POTENTIAL PERPETRATORS AND

01:42:34.448 --> 01:42:36.817
VICTIMS CAN REALLY BE ANYONE.

01:42:36.884 --> 01:42:38.652
SO IT GOES FAR BEYOND IMPACTING

01:42:38.719 --> 01:42:40.087
JUST THOSE WORKING IN THE FILM

01:42:40.153 --> 01:42:41.321
INDUSTRY.

01:42:41.388 --> 01:42:44.224
AN EX BOYFRIEND A FORMER BOSS AN

01:42:44.291 --> 01:42:46.326
ANGRY STUDENT OR ANYONE WITH AN

01:42:46.393 --> 01:42:48.595
AXE TO GRIND CAM PERPETRATE THIS

01:42:48.662 --> 01:42:51.298
TYPE OF ONLINE ABUSE AND EVEN

01:42:51.365 --> 01:42:52.799
WORSE MAKE MONEY OFF OF IT.

01:42:52.866 --> 01:42:54.268
CURRENTLY THERE IS NO CLEAR

01:42:54.334 --> 01:42:55.402
FRAMEWORK FOR OBTAINING

01:42:55.469 --> 01:42:57.337
MEANINGFUL CONSENT FOR DIGITALLY

01:42:57.404 --> 01:42:58.839
PRODUCED SEXUALLY EXPLICIT

01:42:58.906 --> 01:43:00.507
MATERIAL.

01:43:00.574 --> 01:43:02.476
IT IS A BASIC EXPECTATION THAT

01:43:02.543 --> 01:43:04.378
AN INDIVIDUAL SIGN A DULY

01:43:04.444 --> 01:43:05.946
CONSIDERED NEGOTIATED NUDITY

01:43:06.013 --> 01:43:08.382
WRITER BEFORE BEING DEPICTED IN

01:43:08.448 --> 01:43:10.851
THIS WAY IN ANY MOTION PICTURE.

01:43:10.918 --> 01:43:12.553
IT IS A SERIOUS DECISION FOR ANY

01:43:12.619 --> 01:43:14.988
PERFORMER TO DO A NUDE SCENE AS

01:43:15.055 --> 01:43:16.690
IT WILL FOREVER AFFECT THEIR

01:43:16.757 --> 01:43:18.191
HOME LIFE CAREER PUBLIC

01:43:18.258 --> 01:43:20.894
PERCEPTION FAN BASE OR EVEN

01:43:20.961 --> 01:43:22.095
THEIR MENTAL HEALTH.

01:43:22.162 --> 01:43:23.864
ANY SEXUALLY EXPLICIT MATERIAL

01:43:23.931 --> 01:43:25.799
SHOULD BE CAREFULLY SCRIPTED AND

01:43:25.866 --> 01:43:27.501
GREET UPON IN ADVANCE.

01:43:27.568 --> 01:43:29.069
IT IS WRONG TO AMBUSH A

01:43:29.136 --> 01:43:31.638
PERFORMER WITH A NUDITY RIDER ON

01:43:31.705 --> 01:43:33.540
SET AWAY FROM AN AUTHORIZED

01:43:33.607 --> 01:43:35.309
PERSONAL REPRESENTATIVE OR THEIR

01:43:35.375 --> 01:43:36.543
LABOR UNION.

01:43:36.610 --> 01:43:37.945
THESE LAST MINUTE WRITERS ARE A

01:43:38.011 --> 01:43:39.112
PROBLEM IN THE ENTERTAINMENT

01:43:39.179 --> 01:43:41.415
INDUSTRY AND ANY APPLICABLE LAW

01:43:41.481 --> 01:43:43.150
SHOULD LEGALLY PROHIBIT THEM

01:43:43.216 --> 01:43:44.651
UNLESS CERTAIN SAFEGUARDS ARE

01:43:44.718 --> 01:43:46.653
SATISFIED.

01:43:46.720 --> 01:43:49.489
MEMBERS SB FIVE SIXTY FOUR WILL

01:43:49.556 --> 01:43:50.757

SIGNIFICANT AND GROWING PROBLEM

THIS WAS AS BAD AS IT AS IT

01:58:20.460 --> 01:58:23.496

01:58:25.264 --> 01:58:27.567
COMMENT THAT.

01:58:27.633 --> 01:58:29.535
INTUITIVELY I WOULD THINK AN

01:58:29.602 --> 01:58:31.137
ACTOR AND ACTRESS ANYONE THAT

01:58:31.204 --> 01:58:32.472

THAT INDUSTRY [inaudible]

01:58:34.740 --> 01:58:37.877
SHOULD HAVE THE ABILITY TO OWN

01:58:37.944 --> 01:58:40.246
THEIR LIKENESS.

01:58:40.313 --> 01:58:42.248
BUT IF THEY DON'T THAT.

01:58:42.315 --> 01:58:43.449
SOMEONE ELSE'S OWNERSHIP OF THAT

01:58:43.516 --> 01:58:45.685
LIKENESS SHOULD BE WITHIN THE

01:58:45.751 --> 01:58:48.554
CONTEXT OF HOW IT WAS ORIGNALLY.

01:58:48.621 --> 01:58:51.958

02:15:06.832 --> 02:15:16.141
THANK YOU [inaudible]

02:15:16.208 --> 02:15:17.876
GOOD AFTERNOON.

02:15:17.943 --> 02:15:19.511
MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE

02:15:19.578 --> 02:15:21.179
COMMITTEE MARJORIE MURRAY FROM

02:15:21.246 --> 02:15:22.614
THE CENTER FOR CALIFORNIA

02:15:22.681 --> 02:15:24.282
HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION LAW.

02:15:24.349 --> 02:15:25.984
AND I'M ALSO SPEAKING FOR THE

02:15:26.051 --> 02:15:27.652
CALIFORNIA ALLIANCE FOR RETIRED

02:15:27.719 --> 02:15:28.854
AMERICANS I I'M NOT SRE I'VE

02:15:28.920 --> 02:15:29.988
EVER MENTIONED.

02:15:30.055 --> 02:15:32.123
BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE THAT I

02:15:32.190 --> 02:15:33.825
ACTUALLY LIVE IN HAND ONE OF THE

02:15:33.892 --> 02:15:35.527
OLDEST ASSOCIATIONS IN

02:15:35.594 --> 02:15:38.830
CALIFORNIA FORMED IN.

02:15:38.897 --> 02:15:39.998
NINETEEN SEVENTEEN SPECIFICALLY

02:15:40.065 --> 02:15:41.700
TO ENFORCE RACIALLY

02:15:41.766 --> 02:15:43.902
DISCRIMINATORY COVENANTS.

02:15:43.969 --> 02:15:46.204
SO I THOUGHT THAT MIGHT BE OF

02:15:46.271 --> 02:15:48.473
INTEREST TO THE COMMITTEE

02:15:48.540 --> 02:15:48.773
[inaudible]

02:15:48.840 --> 02:15:52.477
WE TESTIFIED BEFORE THE HOUSING

02:15:52.544 --> 02:15:54.079
COMMITTEE ACT WHICH COMMITMENTS

02:15:54.145 --> 02:15:55.514
WERE MADE.

02:15:55.580 --> 02:15:56.882
TO OF CLEAN UP SOME OF THE

02:15:56.948 --> 02:15:58.583
EXEMPTIONS WERE STILL CONCERNED

02:15:58.650 --> 02:16:00.685
ABOUT THE AMENDMENT TO BE TAKEN

02:16:00.752 --> 02:16:02.621
IN COMMITTEE TODAY THAT IT LOOKS

02:16:02.687 --> 02:16:04.890
LIKE EXEMPTIONS CLOSED IN

02:16:04.956 --> 02:16:06.057
DIFFERENT WORDS.

02:16:06.124 --> 02:16:09.027
THAT THE PROPERTY MANAGER IS

02:16:09.094 --> 02:16:11.096
EXCUSED FROM PROVIDING RECORDS

02:16:11.162 --> 02:16:13.498
THAT HAVE BEEN LOST OR DESTROYED

02:16:13.565 --> 02:16:15.534
DUE TO UNFORESEEN CIRCUMSTANCES

02:16:15.600 --> 02:16:17.602
OUTSIDE THE MANAGING AGENTS

02:16:17.669 --> 02:16:18.503
CONTROL.

02:16:18.570 --> 02:16:20.171
SO THAT LANGUAGE STILL IS OF

02:16:20.238 --> 02:16:24.376
CONCERN ALONG WITH THE PROVISION.

02:16:24.442 --> 02:16:26.144
THAT THE MANAGING AGENT DOESN'T

02:16:26.211 --> 02:16:27.679
HAVE TO PRODUCE RECORDS EVEN

02:16:27.746 --> 02:16:30.348
UNDER COURT ORDER UNDER SUBPOENA.

02:16:30.415 --> 02:16:31.850
THAT WAS NOT AN ISSUE ADDRESSED

02:16:31.917 --> 02:16:33.485
IN SENATE HOUSING BUT I WOULD

02:16:33.552 --> 02:16:35.086
LIKE TO DRAW TO THE ATTENTION OF

02:16:35.153 --> 02:16:36.621
THE COMMITTEE HERE.

02:16:36.688 --> 02:16:38.089
THE ISSUE OF SUBPOENA I THINK IS

02:16:38.156 --> 02:16:39.658
AN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT ONE FOR

02:16:39.724 --> 02:16:40.692

02:21:59.377 --> 02:22:00.645
SEEMS.

02:22:00.712 --> 02:22:02.480
THIS COULD BE TIGHTENED UP SOME.

02:22:02.547 --> 02:22:04.015
THERE'S AN EXCEPTION IF THE

02:22:04.082 --> 02:22:06.217
CLIENT RECORDS HAVE BEEN LOST TO

02:22:06.284 --> 02:22:08.519
DAMAGE OR ALTERED.

02:22:08.586 --> 02:22:09.287
WELL SOMEBODY COULD MILITIA

02:22:09.354 --> 02:22:10.588
SLEEP FEED THEM INTO A PAPER

02:22:10.655 --> 02:22:12.323
SHREDDER.

02:22:12.390 --> 02:22:12.824
IN.

02:22:12.891 --> 02:22:15.627
THE EXCEPTION WOULD APPLY.

02:22:15.693 --> 02:22:17.395
IT SEEMS IF YOU SIMPLY.

02:22:17.462 --> 02:22:20.498
WOOD AS THIS MOVES FORWARD.

02:22:20.565 --> 02:22:22.500
STATE INTENT INCLUDE THERE

02:22:22.567 --> 02:22:24.102
SHOULD BE.

02:22:24.168 --> 02:22:25.370
THE SHOULDN'T ALLOW FOR

02:22:25.436 --> 02:22:27.572
INTENTIONAL DESTRUCTION

02:22:27.639 --> 02:22:27.872
[inaudible]

02:22:27.939 --> 02:22:29.874
OF RECORDS IN THE WAY IT READS

02:22:29.941 --> 02:22:31.142
NOW.

02:22:31.209 --> 02:22:33.378
AS I READ IT.

02:22:33.444 --> 02:22:35.246
YOU COULD GET A SUBPOENA YOU CAN

02:22:35.313 --> 02:22:37.215
GET A REQUEST FROM THE SUCCESSOR

02:22:37.282 --> 02:22:38.616

02:22:38.683 --> 02:22:40.318
RECORDS.

02:22:40.385 --> 02:22:41.419
AND YOU COULD DESTROY THE MALL.

02:22:41.486 --> 02:22:43.087
AND SAY SORRY THEY'RE NOT

02:22:43.154 --> 02:22:44.188
AVAILABLE.

02:22:44.255 --> 02:22:44.722
WHERE THEY'VE BEEN ALTERED

02:22:44.789 --> 02:22:46.925
BECAUSE I POURED COFFEE ALL OVER

02:22:46.991 --> 02:22:48.059
THEM?

02:22:48.126 --> 02:22:49.928
YOU CAN DRIVE A TRUCK THROUGH

02:22:49.994 --> 02:22:52.430
THESE EXCEPTIONS SO -- ALL

02:22:52.497 --> 02:22:54.232
DEFERRED TO THE CHAIR AND TO THE

02:22:54.299 --> 02:22:56.167
AUTHOR WHEN YOU GET A CHANCE TO

02:22:56.234 --> 02:22:58.436
RESPOND WELL LET ME JUST PUT THE

02:22:58.503 --> 02:23:00.104
QUESTION TO DIRECTLY -- WOULD

02:23:00.171 --> 02:23:03.041
YOU BE OPEN -- TO TIGHTENING THE

02:23:03.107 --> 02:23:04.108
UP SO THAT SOMEBODY CAN'T

02:23:04.175 --> 02:23:06.110
INTENTIONALLY DESTROY RECORDS

02:23:06.177 --> 02:23:08.112
AND BE PROTECTED YES CENTER THE

02:23:08.179 --> 02:23:09.948
THE WORD IS INTENTIONAL I I

02:23:10.014 --> 02:23:12.317

DEALING WITH.

02:23:14.385 --> 02:23:16.220
AND I THINK THAT JUST TO THIS IS

02:23:16.287 --> 02:23:17.989
TO SEE THAT WHEN THERE'S A

02:23:18.056 --> 02:23:20.224
TRANSFER OF MANAGEMENT COMPANIES

02:23:20.291 --> 02:23:22.327
IT'S JUST THAT SIMPLE IN A IN

02:23:36.674 --> 02:23:38.843
OR THEY HAVE NOT DONE A GOOD OB.

02:23:38.910 --> 02:23:39.877
WHATEVER RECORDS A HAVE SHOULD

02:23:39.944 --> 02:23:41.512
TRANSFER TO THE NEW MANAGEMENT

02:23:41.579 --> 02:23:43.247
COMPANY IS IT'S BASICALLY THAT

02:23:43.314 --> 02:23:46.351
SIMPLE AND WE'RE SAYING THAT IT

SHOULD BE DONE WITHIN A REGIONAL

02:23:48.286 --> 02:23:49.287
RUNNER TIME WE THINK THIRTY DAY

02:23:49.354 --> 02:23:50.088
SHOULD BE THE PINE.

02:23:50.154 --> 02:23:52.790
SOME OF THE OTHER THINGS PERTAIN

02:23:52.857 --> 02:23:54.926

NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS

02:23:59.697 --> 02:24:00.765
PARTICULAR BILL.

02:24:00.832 --> 02:24:03.101
IT JUST TO GO AHEAD AND WHEN

IT'S REQUESTED TO GO OVER AND

02:24:05.103 --> 02:24:06.437
AND I MIGHT POINT OUT.

02:24:06.504 --> 02:24:08.406
THAT -- THE LENDERS THAT ARE

02:24:08.473 --> 02:24:09.607
MAKING THE HOMEOWNERS SPECIALLY

02:24:09.674 --> 02:24:11.809
THAT FIRST TIME HOME BUYER --

02:24:11.876 --> 02:24:13.411
WHO THE BANK IS TRYING TO MAKE

02:24:13.478 --> 02:24:15.246
THE LOAN TO THEY WILL ASK FOR A

02:24:15.313 --> 02:24:16.614
COPY THE HOMEOWNER ASSOCIATION

02:24:16.681 --> 02:24:17.682
THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:24:17.749 --> 02:24:19.317
BUDGET IS INTACT THEY WANT TO

02:24:19.384 --> 02:24:20.184
MAKE SURE?

02:24:20.251 --> 02:24:20.918
THAT THERE'S NO LAWSUIT IN THE

02:24:20.985 --> 02:24:22.520
HISTORY THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE

02:24:22.587 --> 02:24:25.690
THAT THE IT'S IT'S NOT RENTED --

02:24:25.757 --> 02:24:27.825
51% OR MORE THEY MAKE A LOAN SO

02:24:27.892 --> 02:24:29.527
THAT'S ALL IN THE DOCUMENTS AND

02:24:29.594 --> 02:24:31.429
IF FOR WHATEVER REASON THEY HOLD

02:24:31.496 --> 02:24:32.397
BACK.

02:24:32.463 --> 02:24:33.731
THIS BILL WOULD SAY LET'S GO

02:24:33.798 --> 02:24:34.866
AHEAD AND TRANSFER OF EVERYTHING

02:24:34.932 --> 02:24:37.068
THAT YOU HAVE AND AND THEN IF

02:24:37.135 --> 02:24:38.069
THEY'RE GOING TO BE AUDITED.

02:24:38.136 --> 02:24:39.837
LET IT BE AUDITED BY THE NEW

02:24:39.904 --> 02:24:41.339
PERSON SO THEY CAN HAVE QUESTION

02:24:41.406 --> 02:24:43.074
BUT WE'RE TRYING TO PROTECT THE

02:24:43.141 --> 02:24:44.909
CONSUMER HIT IN AYE AYE TOTAL

02:24:44.976 --> 02:24:52.550
IMAGE IF JUST FINISH AND I

02:24:52.617 --> 02:24:53.651
APPRECIATE THAT BEING THE

02:24:53.718 --> 02:24:53.951
OBJECTIVE.

02:24:54.018 --> 02:24:54.719
AND IT'S IT'S CLEARLY

02:24:54.786 --> 02:24:56.387
MINISTERIAL OR CLERICAL IF IF

02:24:56.454 --> 02:24:56.921
THEY'RE JUST PASSING LONG

02:24:56.988 --> 02:24:57.922
RECORDS THE PROBLEM IS IF

02:24:57.989 --> 02:24:58.489
THERE'S BEEN MALFEASANCE IF

02:24:58.556 --> 02:24:59.957
THERE'S BEEN CORRUPTION OF A

02:25:00.024 --> 02:25:01.559
PRIOR MANAGEMENT COMPANY.

02:25:01.626 --> 02:25:04.228
HAS DIVERTED FUNDS OR WHATEVER.

02:25:04.295 --> 02:25:06.164
THEY'RE GOING TO DESTROY THOSE

02:25:06.230 --> 02:25:09.400
RECORDS AND NOT PASS THE MINE IN

02:25:09.467 --> 02:25:12.136
THE USE THE EXEMPTION CITED HERE.

02:25:12.203 --> 02:25:15.273
AS THE RECORDS WERE ALTERED THE

02:25:15.339 --> 02:25:16.474
RECORDS.

02:25:16.541 --> 02:25:17.542
AND THE KEY WORD THAT YOU

02:25:17.608 --> 02:25:19.177
BROUGHT UP WHICH WAS WOULD COULD

02:25:19.243 --> 02:25:21.012
MAKE THE DIFFERENCE AS I THINK

02:25:21.079 --> 02:25:22.113
THAT'S PART OF IT I DON'T KNOW

02:25:22.180 --> 02:25:23.881
THAT THAT'S THE TOTAL WORD

02:25:23.948 --> 02:25:25.516
CRAFTING THAT WOULD BE. TO

02:25:25.583 --> 02:25:27.718
TIGHTEN THIS UP SO IT DOESN'T

02:25:27.785 --> 02:25:32.824
PROTECT SOMEBODY WHO'S TRYING TO

02:25:32.890 --> 02:25:33.991
COVER UP MALFEASANCE.

02:25:34.058 --> 02:25:34.892
THEY'RE THEY'RE TRYING TO AVOID

02:25:34.959 --> 02:25:37.595
PASSING ALONG INFORMATION SO IT

02:25:37.662 --> 02:25:38.229
MIGHT BE WE COULD TIGHTEN SO IF

02:25:38.296 --> 02:25:40.198
IF I MAY IF YOU LOOK AT

02:25:40.264 --> 02:25:44.035
AMENDMENT -- FOR UNDER.

02:25:44.102 --> 02:25:45.303
PAGE -- TO STRUT STRIKING

02:25:45.369 --> 02:25:48.773
OUTLINES -- TWENTY TWO TO THIRTY

02:25:48.840 --> 02:25:49.941
ONE UNDERSEA ONE IT SAYS THE

02:25:50.007 --> 02:25:51.476
RECORD HAS BEEN LOST OR

02:25:51.542 --> 02:25:53.644
DESTROYED DUE TO UNFORESEEN

02:25:53.711 --> 02:25:55.279
CIRCUMSTANCES SO.

02:25:55.346 --> 02:25:57.615
THERE ARE IF IF IN FACT THIS IS

02:25:57.682 --> 02:26:00.918
DONE INTENTIONALLY -- AND IT HAS

02:26:00.985 --> 02:26:02.954
TO BE OUTSIDE OF THE MANAGING

02:26:03.020 --> 02:26:04.956
AGENTS CONTROL.

02:26:05.022 --> 02:26:06.858
SOLD BUT WE CAN CERTAINLY I

02:26:06.924 --> 02:26:08.192
THINK CLEARLY THAT'S YOUR INTENT

02:26:08.259 --> 02:26:09.727
AND PERHAPS TIGHTENING IT UP

02:26:09.794 --> 02:26:11.963
EVEN FURTHER -- IT WOULD BE

02:26:12.029 --> 02:26:13.598
HELPFUL BECAUSE WHAT I THINK WE

02:26:13.664 --> 02:26:16.300
ALL SHARE -- THE NOTION THAT --

02:26:16.367 --> 02:26:17.735
WE CERTAINLY HAVE SEEN THIS IN

02:26:17.802 --> 02:26:19.504
THE POLITICAL WORLD SUDDENLY

02:26:19.570 --> 02:26:21.672
DOCUMENTS DISAPPEAR ARE SHREDDED

02:26:21.739 --> 02:26:22.540
OVERNIGHT.

02:26:22.607 --> 02:26:24.976
THERE'S A SEVENTEEN MINUTE GAP

02:26:25.042 --> 02:26:27.545
IN THE TAPE -- THAT THE ALL

02:26:27.612 --> 02:26:29.347
SORTS OF THINGS THAT -- THAT CAN

02:26:29.413 --> 02:26:31.582
OCCUR BUT THOSE FOR INTENTIONAL

02:26:31.649 --> 02:26:33.050
SO.

02:26:33.117 --> 02:26:33.885
CERTAINLY WILL TAKE A LOOK AT

02:26:33.951 --> 02:26:36.254
THAT -- AND I AND I HOPE THAT TO

02:26:36.320 --> 02:26:38.589
AND I'M SURE YOU'RE COMMITTED TO

02:26:38.656 --> 02:26:41.159
DURING THAT ARTS.

02:26:41.225 --> 02:26:42.793
CENTER WERE CASKEY.

02:26:42.860 --> 02:26:43.594
I GUESS THE OPPOSITION BROUGHT

02:26:43.661 --> 02:26:44.428
UP THE IDEA OF HAVING THE

02:26:44.495 --> 02:26:45.530
RECORDS DIGITIZED BECAUSE

02:26:45.596 --> 02:26:47.532
THERE'S A THERE'S SAID CHALLENGE

02:26:47.598 --> 02:26:49.233
HERE OF WHO OWNS RECORDS IS THAT

02:26:49.300 --> 02:26:50.668
THE H. AWAY HE'S.

02:26:50.735 --> 02:26:51.869
PROPERTY THAT THEY OWN OR THIS

02:26:51.936 --> 02:26:53.437
PROPERTY MANAGER THAT'S BEEN

02:26:53.504 --> 02:26:55.806
HIRED FOR A FIVE YEAR -- IT

02:26:55.873 --> 02:26:57.008
WOULD IT WOULD BE THE UNDER THE

02:26:57.074 --> 02:26:59.010
OWNERSHIP OF THE H. AWAY RIGHT

02:26:59.076 --> 02:27:00.578
AND I GUESS THE QUESTION IS THIS

02:27:00.645 --> 02:27:03.514
OR THAT SUGGESTION IS IS THAT IT

02:27:03.581 --> 02:27:05.449
PITS DIGITIZE AND THEN IT'S

02:27:05.516 --> 02:27:07.285
ELECTRONICALLY TRANSMITTED TO

02:27:07.351 --> 02:27:08.219
THE H. AWAY.

02:27:08.286 --> 02:27:11.489
AND THE BOWL.

02:27:11.556 --> 02:27:13.057
THE AGENT AND THE H. AWAY.

02:27:13.124 --> 02:27:15.159
RETAIN IT THEN THERE'S LESS

02:27:15.226 --> 02:27:17.295
POTENTIAL FOR MALFEASANCE AND

02:27:17.361 --> 02:27:18.663
THE DESTRUCTION UP IN THE IN THE

02:27:18.729 --> 02:27:20.431
TO THE H. AWAY THAT HAS UPDATED

02:27:20.498 --> 02:27:22.633
RECORDS WHETHER THEY BE HARD

02:27:22.700 --> 02:27:24.702
COPY WHETHER THEY BE A COMPUTER.

02:27:24.769 --> 02:27:28.606
THE THE THE THE IDEA OF THIS SB

02:27:28.673 --> 02:27:29.273
FOUR THIRTY FOUR IS TO MAKE SURE

02:27:29.340 --> 02:27:30.341
THEY TURNED IT OVER AND OUT IN A

02:27:30.408 --> 02:27:31.375
TIMELY MANNER THAT'S IT WILL

02:27:31.442 --> 02:27:32.610
MAKE THE ADJUSTMENT.

02:27:32.677 --> 02:27:35.580
ON THE OTHER BUT WE'RE WE'RE

02:27:35.646 --> 02:27:38.082
TRYING TO WORK WITH THEM SO IT

02:27:38.149 --> 02:27:41.185
CAN HAPPEN.

02:27:41.252 --> 02:27:42.820
MADAM CHAIR IF AFFECT FALL AYE I

02:27:42.887 --> 02:27:45.323
GUESS THE THE LANGUAGE I WAS NOT

02:27:45.389 --> 02:27:46.357
SUPPORT IN THE HOUSING --

02:27:46.424 --> 02:27:47.258
COMMITTEE AND I'M LOOKING FOR AN

02:27:47.325 --> 02:27:48.893
AFFIRMATIVE DUTY YOU KNOW THAT

02:27:48.960 --> 02:27:51.095
WE WE WE CREATE DUTIES ALL THE

02:27:51.162 --> 02:27:53.397
TIME FOR FOR FOLKS AND AND

02:27:53.464 --> 02:27:55.399
THERE'S A THERE'S A A

02:27:55.466 --> 02:27:56.734
PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES

02:27:56.801 --> 02:27:58.502
THAT THEY HAVE BUT BUT IT SEEMS

02:27:58.569 --> 02:28:00.071
LIKE ON THESE VITAL RECORDS.

02:28:00.137 --> 02:28:02.540
THIS SUGGESTION THAT THAT PEOPLE

02:28:02.607 --> 02:28:03.274
CAN.

02:28:03.341 --> 02:28:04.709
THEY THEY HAVE OWNERSHIP OF

02:28:04.775 --> 02:28:06.544
PROPERTY MANAGERS AND I I

02:28:06.611 --> 02:28:07.678
APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENTS

02:28:07.745 --> 02:28:08.879
BECAUSE THEY THEY HAVE COME A

02:28:08.946 --> 02:28:10.348
LONG WAYS TO CLOSE THE GAP BUT

02:28:10.414 --> 02:28:12.283
BUT I GUESS THAT'S THAT'S WHAT

02:28:12.350 --> 02:28:14.819
I'M LOOKING FOR HERE IS THAT.

02:28:14.885 --> 02:28:15.686
IS THAT A DUTY TO PROTECT IN IT

02:28:15.753 --> 02:28:17.722
AND THAT THE THAT THEY ARE IN

02:28:17.788 --> 02:28:19.190
IGNORE WHICH MEANT THAT THEY ARE

02:28:19.257 --> 02:28:20.958
THE H. ALWAYS IT'S IT'S THERE

02:28:21.025 --> 02:28:23.060
BUT I MAYBE.

02:28:23.127 --> 02:28:24.161
WE CAN WE CAN.

NOT SUPPORT THIS IN HOUSING

02:30:06.297 --> 02:30:08.399

02:30:08.466 --> 02:30:11.435
TOO MANY -- TOO MANY WAYS FOR

02:30:11.502 --> 02:30:12.870

REQUESTED BY THE COMMITTEE.

02:32:48.225 --> 02:32:50.528
AND THE BIG QUESTION.

02:32:50.594 --> 02:32:52.997
WITH MY BILL IS WHEN IS ELECTION

02:32:53.063 --> 02:32:54.098
AN ELECTION.

02:32:54.164 --> 02:32:55.733
IRAN FOR REELECTION FOR THE

02:32:55.799 --> 02:32:56.767
ORANGE COUNTY TREASURER -- THREE

02:32:56.834 --> 02:32:59.036
TIMES.

02:32:59.103 --> 02:33:00.437
NEVER HAD AN OPPONENT.

02:33:00.504 --> 02:33:02.473
I GET 98% OF THE VOTE I NGUYEN

02:33:02.540 --> 02:33:04.475
BUT WHAT WAS THE REASON FOR

02:33:04.542 --> 02:33:06.210
GOING THROUGH A SINGLE SLATE.

02:33:06.277 --> 02:33:08.812
ELECTION WAS IT EVEN NECESSARY

02:33:08.879 --> 02:33:09.780
THE RESULTS OF THE OUTCOME WOULD

02:33:09.847 --> 02:33:11.181
HAVE BEEN THE SAME THEY JUST

02:33:11.248 --> 02:33:12.449
SAID AT THE END OF FILING THAT --

02:33:12.516 --> 02:33:13.851
YOU YOU YOU WON THE ELECTION

02:33:13.918 --> 02:33:15.486
WHICH IS DONE FOR A LOT OF

02:33:15.553 --> 02:33:17.454
MUNICIPALITY RACES -- BUT THE

02:33:17.521 --> 02:33:18.422
WAY TO HAVE AN ELECTION IS TO

02:33:18.489 --> 02:33:21.292
HAVE AT LEAST TWO CANDIDATES.

02:33:21.358 --> 02:33:23.093
FOR EACH OPEN POSITION THAT IS A

02:33:23.160 --> 02:33:24.361
DOUBLE SLATE.

02:33:24.428 --> 02:33:26.063
A SINGLE FLIGHT IS REDUNDANT AND

02:33:26.130 --> 02:33:27.531
COSTLY AND THAT'S WHAT'S

02:33:27.598 --> 02:33:29.166
HAPPENING WITH HOMEOWNERS

02:33:29.233 --> 02:33:30.467
ASSOCIATION SO.

02:33:30.534 --> 02:33:31.869
COLLEAGUES THE DAVIS STIRLING

02:33:31.936 --> 02:33:33.604
COMMON INTEREST DEVELOPMENT ACT

02:33:33.671 --> 02:33:35.506
NEEDS ANOTHER.

02:33:35.573 --> 02:33:37.942
BUT RATHER SIMPLE TWEAK. FOR THE

02:33:38.008 --> 02:33:39.944
BOARD ELECTIONS IF ONLY THE SAME

02:33:40.010 --> 02:33:41.412
NUMBER OF CANDIDATES OR LESS

02:33:41.478 --> 02:33:43.047
SUPPLY FOR THE AMOUNT OF OPEN

02:33:43.113 --> 02:33:43.781
SEATS.

02:33:43.847 --> 02:33:44.915
DURING THE FILING PERIOD THEN

02:33:44.982 --> 02:33:46.183
THE NOMINEES ARE CONSIDERED

02:33:46.250 --> 02:33:50.321
ELECTED BY ACCLAMATION -- I I

02:33:50.387 --> 02:33:51.021
LIVE IN TO HOMEOWNERS

02:33:51.088 --> 02:33:53.591
ASSOCIATIONS OF ONE HERE AND ONE

02:33:53.657 --> 02:33:54.425
AT HOME.

02:33:54.491 --> 02:33:56.093
IT IT'S TOUGH TO GET PEOPLE TO

02:33:56.160 --> 02:33:57.494
EVEN RUN FOR THE BOARD OF

02:33:57.561 --> 02:34:01.365
DIRECTORS OF BUT WHY SHOULD I BE

02:34:01.432 --> 02:34:03.167
RECEIVING A BALLOT IN THE MAIL.

02:34:03.233 --> 02:34:05.169
AFTER THE FILING PERIOD -- ON A

02:34:05.235 --> 02:34:08.238
SINGLE SLATE SB SEVEN FIFTY FOUR

02:34:08.305 --> 02:34:09.773
SAVES ON MAILING AND

02:34:09.840 --> 02:34:11.675
ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS IT'S ONE

02:34:11.742 --> 02:34:13.143
COMMUTER MY DISTRICT YOU'LL HEAR

02:34:13.210 --> 02:34:15.613
THE WITNESS YOU KNOW IT'S A

02:34:15.679 --> 02:34:17.214
CONSIDERABLE COST.

02:34:17.281 --> 02:34:19.116
SO THIS IS IDENTICAL TO SB

02:34:19.183 --> 02:34:19.750
ELEVEN TWENTY EIGHT SENATOR ROBB

02:34:19.817 --> 02:34:20.918
FROM LAST YEAR.

02:34:20.985 --> 02:34:23.020
IT WENT THROUGH THE ENTIRE --

02:34:23.087 --> 02:34:25.222
LEGISLATURE -- WITH FULL SUPPORT

02:34:25.289 --> 02:34:27.424
BY BIPARTISAN BUT IT WAS A VETO

02:34:27.491 --> 02:34:28.726
BY THE GOVERNOR BECAUSE HE FELT

02:34:28.792 --> 02:34:29.893
THAT IT SHOULD BE DONE AT THE

02:34:29.960 --> 02:34:32.029
LOCAL LEVEL BUT YOU NEED TO BE

02:34:32.096 --> 02:34:34.598
ABLE TO DO IT -- WITH SOME MINOR

02:34:34.665 --> 02:34:35.766
CHANGES TO THE DAVIS STIRLING

02:34:35.833 --> 02:34:37.501
ACT AND THAT'S WHY WE HAVE THIS

02:34:37.568 --> 02:34:38.535
BILL.

02:34:38.602 --> 02:34:39.703
SO FOR THOSE THAT HAVE

02:36:00.551 --> 02:36:01.752
WE WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SAVE

02:36:01.819 --> 02:36:02.986

02:36:06.590 --> 02:36:07.124
TO JUST SPENDING IT FOR

02:36:07.191 --> 02:36:09.059
SOMETHING THAT WASN'T NEEDED

02:36:09.126 --> 02:36:11.495
BECAUSE WE HAD THE NUMBER OF

02:36:19.837 --> 02:36:22.206
A VERY ACTIVE H. AWAY.

02:36:22.272 --> 02:36:23.307

BEING ON THE BOARD WHAT WE'RE

02:36:26.877 --> 02:36:27.344
FINDING IS.

02:36:27.411 --> 02:36:28.345

02:36:34.384 --> 02:36:35.452
OUR BOARD.

DO WANT TO GET PEOPLE RUN THAT

02:36:38.455 --> 02:36:39.923

02:38:01.538 --> 02:38:03.373
THERE IS AMPLE PRECEDENT IN

02:38:03.440 --> 02:38:05.275
OTHER.

02:38:05.342 --> 02:38:07.211
GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES LIKE

SCHOOL BOARDS EVEN CITY COUNCILS

02:38:10.948 --> 02:38:11.715
FOR THE USE OF ACCLAMATION.

02:38:11.782 --> 02:38:13.584
HOWEVER.

USE OF ACCLAMATION AND THAT'S

02:38:28.565 --> 02:38:30.267
ONE OF THE MAIN PROBLEMS THAT WE

02:38:30.334 --> 02:38:33.003
HAVE WITH SB.

02:38:33.070 --> 02:38:34.771
SEVEN OF FIFTY FOUR THAT THERE

02:38:34.838 --> 02:38:36.807
IS NO OPPORTUNITY FOR THE

02:38:36.874 --> 02:38:38.075
ELECTORATE THAT IS FOR

02:38:38.141 --> 02:38:41.511
HOMEOWNERS TO OBJECT TO THE USE

02:38:41.578 --> 02:38:43.480

02:38:43.547 --> 02:38:45.449
IT'S DONE BY FIAT BY THE BOARD

02:38:45.515 --> 02:38:47.417
WHICH SIMPLY DECLARES WE CAN'T

02:38:47.484 --> 02:38:49.620
FIND ENOUGH QUALIFIED PEOPLE AND

02:38:49.686 --> 02:38:51.889

CANDIDATES THAT WE HAVE

02:38:56.860 --> 02:38:59.096
IDENTIFIED WHICH RAISES ONE OF

02:38:59.162 --> 02:39:00.430
THE OTHER ISSUES THAT I'S THE

02:39:00.497 --> 02:39:02.766
BOARD SETTING THE QUALIFICATIONS

02:39:02.833 --> 02:39:04.635
THAT IS NOT THE CASE WITH CITY

02:39:04.701 --> 02:39:06.670
COUNCILS AND SPECIAL DISTRICTS

02:39:06.737 --> 02:39:08.205

02:39:08.272 --> 02:39:10.874
THOSE QUALIFICATIONS ARE SET BY

02:39:10.941 --> 02:39:12.442
THE ELECTIONS CODE.

02:39:12.509 --> 02:39:14.044
BUT IN THE HOMEOWNER ASSOCIATION

02:39:14.111 --> 02:39:15.479
ENVIRONMENT.

02:39:15.545 --> 02:39:18.181
YOU HAVE NO SEPARATION OF POWERS

02:39:18.248 --> 02:39:19.149

02:39:19.216 --> 02:39:21.251
QUALIFICATIONS THAT RUNS

02:39:21.318 --> 02:39:23.387
ELECTIONS THE CHOOSES THE

02:39:23.453 --> 02:39:24.821
EQUIVALENT OF THE REGISTRAR OF

02:39:24.888 --> 02:39:25.756
VOTERS.

02:39:25.822 --> 02:39:27.824
THAT COUNTS THE BALLOTS AND THEN

02:39:27.891 --> 02:39:31.261
DECLARES THAT THE CHOICE OF

02:39:31.328 --> 02:39:32.930
DIRECTORS.

02:39:32.996 --> 02:39:34.598
IT'S A DONE DEAL.

02:39:34.665 --> 02:39:36.867
SO IT'S NOT A VERY GOOD

02:39:36.934 --> 02:39:38.302
COMPARISON TO SAY.

02:39:38.368 --> 02:39:39.536
THAT THESE OTHER GOVERNMENTAL

02:39:39.603 --> 02:39:41.238
ENTITIES USE ACCLAMATION AND

02:39:41.305 --> 02:39:43.040
THEREFORE IT SHOULD BE MIMICKED

02:39:43.106 --> 02:39:44.474
IN THE HOMEOWNER ASSOCIATION

DISQUALIFICATION PROCESS AS A

02:42:24.367 --> 02:42:27.304
METHOD OF INSULATING IN COMMENTS --

02:42:27.370 --> 02:42:29.906

02:42:41.885 --> 02:42:44.621

WHICH THEY HAD THREE BOARDS

02:42:57.100 --> 02:42:57.934
SEPARATE BOARDS SO THEY HAVE FOR

02:42:58.001 --> 02:42:59.536
EACH MUTUAL THEY HELPED OUT

THE NUMBER OF DIRECTOR NOMINEES

02:48:46.916 --> 02:48:48.952
IS NOT MORE THAN THE NUMBER OF

02:48:49.018 --> 02:48:50.353

BEFORE THE CLOSE OF NOMINATIONS

02:49:11.875 --> 02:49:13.176
SO IT DOESN'T BECOME EFFECTIVE

02:49:13.243 --> 02:49:13.710
THE REGIONAL ACCLAMATION.

02:49:13.776 --> 02:49:15.578

02:49:30.527 --> 02:49:31.528
IN THE BILL.

02:49:31.594 --> 02:49:35.765
SO IN THAT ALSO FEATURED PAGE

02:49:35.832 --> 02:49:36.432

WANT TO RUN YOU CAN NOMINATE

02:50:01.190 --> 02:50:04.561
YOURSELF -- BUT I DO THINK THERE

02:50:04.627 --> 02:50:05.495
WAS A MAYBE A LITTLE

02:50:05.562 --> 02:50:07.297
MISUNDERSTANDING.

02:50:07.363 --> 02:50:09.599
IF THIS PASSES IT'S NOT OPTIONAL

02:50:09.666 --> 02:50:10.967
FOR THE H. SHOW A IT WOULD

02:50:11.034 --> 02:50:12.168
BECOME THE LAW OF THE STATE OF

02:50:12.235 --> 02:50:12.802
CALIFORNIA.

02:50:12.869 --> 02:50:14.571
AND IT WOULD.

02:50:14.637 --> 02:50:17.740
REQUIRE A HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION

02:50:17.807 --> 02:50:20.043
TO PROVIDE THIS NOTICE. THIRTY

02:50:20.109 --> 02:50:23.780

QUALIFIED CANDIDATES WITH ONLY A

02:50:26.549 --> 02:50:29.118
NUMERATOR EXEMPTIONS SO THAT THE

EXISTING BOARD COULDN'T

02:50:31.220 --> 02:50:33.022
DISQUALIFY SOMEBODY [inaudible]

02:50:33.089 --> 02:50:34.390
WHIMSICALLY.

02:50:34.457 --> 02:50:37.727

02:50:41.531 --> 02:50:43.266
AMENDMENTS.

02:50:43.333 --> 02:50:45.735

THIRD IS THE ISSUE OF

03:04:15.043 --> 03:04:16.311
COMPENSATION AN ANALYSIS STATES

03:04:16.378 --> 03:04:17.613
THAT ON PAGE THREE AGAIN THAT

03:04:17.679 --> 03:04:18.247
IT'S TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE NOT

FINALLY IN THE RULES OF COURT

03:04:26.655 --> 03:04:28.390

WELL THERE IS A LIST TO THE COME

03:04:33.195 --> 03:04:34.196
TO MY MIND TO TALK ABOUT THE

03:04:34.263 --> 03:04:36.331
SITUATION HERE IS THAT THE

03:04:36.398 --> 03:04:38.233

INAPPROPRIATE.

03:04:49.878 --> 03:04:51.013
AND THEN ALSO TO MAKE SURE THAT

03:04:51.079 --> 03:04:52.881
THERE IS A A REASONABLE BASIS

03:04:52.948 --> 03:04:54.450

IT THAT THEY'RE CONCERNED ABOUT --

03:38:35.435 --> 03:38:37.504
I THINK WHAT WE'VE BEEN TRYING

TO DO IS TO REACH OUT AND TO GET

03:38:39.105 --> 03:38:40.207

BECAUSE FOR ME I ALWAYS HAVE A

03:39:05.632 --> 03:39:06.633
CONCERN.

03:39:06.700 --> 03:39:09.269
WHEN THERE'S LEGISLATION?

03:39:09.336 --> 03:39:12.072
THAT LOOKS AS THOUGH IT'S IT'S

03:39:12.138 --> 03:39:13.940
BROUGHT IN THE INTEREST OF A

03:39:14.007 --> 03:39:16.977
SINGLE COMPANY -- AND YOU KNOW I

03:39:17.043 --> 03:39:18.545

FLAGS GO UP AROUND THAT WITH ALL

03:39:20.814 --> 03:39:23.383

WERE IN AN OPEN COMPETITIVE

03:39:26.119 --> 03:39:28.088
MARKET PLACE IN WHEN THE

03:39:28.154 --> 03:39:29.723
LEGISLATURE SHOULDN'T BE TEAMING

03:39:29.789 --> 03:39:30.590
UP.

03:39:30.657 --> 03:39:33.326
PERSPECTIVE BUSINESS ADVANTAGE

03:39:33.393 --> 03:39:34.828
FOR SINGLE COMPANY SO WITH THE

03:39:34.895 --> 03:39:36.162
PERMISSION OF THE CHAIR I WOULD

03:39:36.229 --> 03:39:37.697
LIKE TO JUST ASK.

03:39:37.764 --> 03:39:38.231
MISTER LEE IS THAT CORRECT

03:39:38.298 --> 03:39:41.001
SHARKS.

03:39:41.067 --> 03:39:41.835
WHAT?

03:39:41.902 --> 03:39:43.803
WHAT WOULD BE NEEDED FOR THIS

03:39:43.870 --> 03:39:48.008
BILL TO CREATE -- FAIR ACCESS TO

03:39:48.074 --> 03:39:49.509
THESE PRODUCTS IN THE

03:39:49.576 --> 03:39:51.478
MARKETPLACE I THINK OUR OVERALL

03:39:51.545 --> 03:39:53.847
REACTION IS THE BILL IS IN THE

03:39:53.914 --> 03:39:55.782
RIGHT DIRECTION -- BECAUSE I

03:39:55.849 --> 03:39:56.816
THINK THERE IS SOME STATUTORY

03:39:56.883 --> 03:39:58.752
REQUIREMENTS AND STATUTORY

03:39:58.818 --> 03:40:00.320
CLARIFICATION THAT'S REQUIRED

03:40:00.387 --> 03:40:02.355
GIVEN THAT WHAT WE ARE DOING --

03:40:02.422 --> 03:40:03.924
BOTH ACTIVE IN OURSELVES AND A

03:40:03.990 --> 03:40:05.859
FEW OTHERS SORT OF FALLS WITHIN

03:40:05.926 --> 03:40:07.928
THE CRACKS -- OF THE CURRENT

03:40:07.994 --> 03:40:09.529
LEGISLATIVE.

03:40:09.596 --> 03:40:11.431
AND REGULATORY SCHEMA MY VIEW

03:40:11.498 --> 03:40:13.099
THOUGH IS THE BILL PROBABLY DOES

03:40:13.166 --> 03:40:15.168
TOO MUCH -- I THINK SOME OF THE

03:40:15.235 --> 03:40:16.303
THINGS IN THE BILL --

03:40:16.369 --> 03:40:17.938
POTENTIALLY COULD BE PERCEIVED

03:40:18.004 --> 03:40:20.340
AS FAVORING ONE MODEL OVER

03:40:20.407 --> 03:40:23.877
ANOTHER AND SO I THINK THE ONUS.

03:40:23.944 --> 03:40:25.879
OR THE THE AT THE PRIMARY DRIVER

03:40:25.946 --> 03:40:27.647
BEHIND THIS IS QUITE ADMIRABLE

03:40:27.714 --> 03:40:28.949
WHICH IS TO PROVIDE THAT

03:40:29.015 --> 03:40:30.817
STATUTORY CLARIFICATION.

03:40:30.884 --> 03:40:31.952
BUT THAT'S PROBABLY ALL THAT'S

03:40:32.018 --> 03:40:33.753
REALLY NEEDED AT THIS POINT TO

03:40:33.820 --> 03:40:35.755
ENSURE THAT THE MARKET PLACE

03:40:35.822 --> 03:40:37.123
DEVELOPS FAIRLY.%

FORWARD BUT THANK YOU.

03:40:54.007 --> 03:40:55.842
I ED THE TWO HAD AONG MY

03:40:55.909 --> 03:40:59.412
QUESTIONS -- THE FACT THAT -- IT

03:40:59.479 --> 03:41:01.481
APPEARED THAT THIS BILL WAS

03:41:01.548 --> 03:41:04.451
FOCUSING ON A THE BUSINESS MODEL

03:41:04.517 --> 03:41:06.019
OF ONE COMPANY WHICH HAS.

03:41:06.086 --> 03:41:08.688
A CENTER MINING INDICATES IS.

03:41:08.755 --> 03:41:10.056
INAPPROPRIATE FOR US AS A

03:41:10.123 --> 03:41:11.324
LEGISLATURE.

03:41:11.391 --> 03:41:15.128
I AM I AM CONCERNED HOWEVER THAT --

03:41:15.195 --> 03:41:16.696
WE HAVE SEEN WITH SO MUCH OF

03:41:16.763 --> 03:41:19.633
THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY WE HAVE SEEN.

03:41:19.699 --> 03:41:22.802
NO GUIDELINES NO REGULATIONS AND

03:41:22.869 --> 03:41:25.605
THE US WE HAVE SEEN A WILD WEST

03:41:25.672 --> 03:41:27.540
AMONG SOME OF THESE TECHNOLOGY

03:41:27.607 --> 03:41:28.508
COMPANIES.

03:41:28.575 --> 03:41:31.645
SO THAT WHEN WE FINALLY REALIZED

03:41:31.711 --> 03:41:33.146
THAT WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING

03:41:33.213 --> 03:41:36.950
WE'RE TOLD HE WILL DESTROY OUR

03:41:37.017 --> 03:41:38.385
BUSINESS MODEL -- SO FOR ME I

03:41:38.451 --> 03:41:41.221
THINK WE NEED TO LOOK AT SETTING

03:41:41.287 --> 03:41:43.823
SOME GUIDELINES AND REGULATIONS

03:41:43.890 --> 03:41:45.225
TO ASSURE THAT.

03:41:45.291 --> 03:41:47.360

UNDERSTAND WHAT OUR EXPECTATIONS

03:41:50.096 --> 03:41:52.165
AND WHAT OUR DEMANDS -- WILL BE

03:41:52.232 --> 03:41:54.034
IS PUBLIC POLICY MAKERS TO

PROTECT CONSUMERS WHILE AT THE

03:41:55.602 --> 03:41:56.936
SAME TIME.

ENCOURAGING THE KINDS OF

03:41:58.505 --> 03:42:00.607

TO BE THE NET APP PRODUCE THE

03:42:18.692 --> 03:42:20.560
NEXT PRODUCT OF OPPORTUNITY FOR

03:42:20.627 --> 03:42:22.262
EMPLOYEES TO ACTUALLY ACCESS THE

03:42:22.328 --> 03:42:23.296
REAL MONEY.

03:42:23.363 --> 03:42:25.598
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THIS IS --

03:42:25.665 --> 03:42:27.367
AND AT THE SAME TIME A

03:42:27.434 --> 03:42:28.835
RECOGNIZING UNLIKE PAYDAY

03:42:28.902 --> 03:42:30.537
LENDERS WHO CHARGES EXORBITANT

03:42:30.603 --> 03:42:32.138
RATES ON THE THEORY THAT THE

03:42:32.205 --> 03:42:33.206
RISK IS HIGH.

03:42:33.273 --> 03:42:35.041
THERE'S NO RISK HERE BECAUSE THE

03:42:35.108 --> 03:42:37.110
MONEY'S ALREADY BEEN ORINDA JUST

03:42:37.177 --> 03:42:38.011
HASN'T BEEN TRANSFERRED.

03:42:38.078 --> 03:42:40.046
I DO YOU HAVE SOME SUGGESTIONS

03:42:40.113 --> 03:42:42.916
THAT ARE PERHAPS -- SENATOR

03:42:42.982 --> 03:42:45.518
CAFIERO COULD CONSIDER GOING

03:42:45.585 --> 03:42:48.188
FORWARD -- THAT WOULD RECOGNIZE

03:42:48.254 --> 03:42:51.491
THE POTENTIAL OF THIS FIELD ON A

03:42:51.558 --> 03:42:52.792
FROM MANY DIFFERENT LEVELS.

03:42:52.859 --> 03:42:54.127
WELL AT THE SAME TIME GIVING

03:42:54.194 --> 03:42:58.198
GUIDANCE TO THIS NEWLY EMERGING

03:42:58.264 --> 03:43:00.100
INDUSTRY.

03:43:00.166 --> 03:43:00.700
AND I'D ARE VITAMIN FROM YOU

03:43:00.767 --> 03:43:01.634
WHEN FROM THE PROPONENTS OF THIS

03:43:01.701 --> 03:43:03.970
BILL [inaudible]

03:43:04.037 --> 03:43:06.706
SURE AN LOOK LET ME START BY

03:43:06.773 --> 03:43:08.675
SAYING THE PERIL HASN'T CHANGED

03:43:08.742 --> 03:43:09.776
IN ABOUT TWO CENTURIES.

03:43:09.843 --> 03:43:11.611
AND SO WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE --

03:43:11.678 --> 03:43:14.147
IS VERY CUTTING EDGE AND IT DOES

03:43:14.214 --> 03:43:15.849
REQUIRE A FAIR AMOUNT OF THOUGHT --

03:43:15.915 --> 03:43:17.417
AND REALLY DELIBERATE

03:43:17.484 --> 03:43:20.754
CONSIDERATION -- AROUND ALL OF

03:43:20.820 --> 03:43:21.554
THE POTENTIAL IMPLICATIONS

03:43:21.621 --> 03:43:23.690
AROUND TRYING TO CHANGE THINGS

03:43:23.757 --> 03:43:25.291
WITH PAYROLL.

03:43:25.358 --> 03:43:27.127
HAVING SAID THAT -- I THINK AS A

03:43:27.193 --> 03:43:29.462
COMPANY -- AND CERTAINLY AS WE

03:43:29.529 --> 03:43:32.465
SURVEY EMPLOYERS AND OUR USERS

03:43:32.532 --> 03:43:33.666
THE THING THAT IS VERY APPARENT

03:43:33.733 --> 03:43:36.069
IS.

03:43:36.136 --> 03:43:37.637
FOLKS UNDERSTAND THAT THEY'VE

03:43:37.704 --> 03:43:39.672
ALREADY EARNED THESE WAGES.

03:43:39.739 --> 03:43:42.108
IT IS THEIR MONEY AS AS AS YOU

03:43:42.175 --> 03:43:43.409
SAID MANAGE IT ALREADY IS THERE

03:43:43.476 --> 03:43:44.744
MONEY THEY'VE ALREADY EARNED IT.

03:43:44.811 --> 03:43:45.812
AND SO ONE OF THE PRINCIPLES

03:43:45.879 --> 03:43:47.413
THAT AT LEAST WE HAVE HELD

03:43:47.480 --> 03:43:49.282
OURSELVES TO IT'S ENSURING THAT

03:43:49.349 --> 03:43:51.918
EMPLOYEES CAN ACCESS THAT WHEN

03:43:51.985 --> 03:43:52.952
THEY WANT.

03:43:53.019 --> 03:43:54.521
IT IS A LITTLE BIT ODD THAT

03:43:54.587 --> 03:43:55.922
SOMEONE HAS TO QUIT A JOB.

03:43:55.989 --> 03:43:58.391
IN ORDER FOR HER TO ACTUALLY GET

03:43:58.458 --> 03:44:00.093
EVERYTHING THAT IS DUE -- TO AND

03:44:00.160 --> 03:44:01.094
UNFORTUNATELY WE DO SEE

03:44:01.161 --> 03:44:02.762
SITUATIONS LIKE THAT WHERE

03:44:02.829 --> 03:44:04.164
SOMEONE IS IN SUCH DIRE

03:44:04.230 --> 03:44:05.398
CONSTRAINTS.

03:44:05.465 --> 03:44:07.967
BECAUSE THEY NEED TO PAY A BILL

03:44:08.034 --> 03:44:08.902
THAT THE WIND UP QUITTING A JOB.

03:44:08.968 --> 03:44:11.137
JUST SO THEY CAN GET.

03:44:11.204 --> 03:44:12.372
WHAT IS ACTUALLY -- TO THEM

03:44:12.438 --> 03:44:14.073
SINCE PAID IS NOT UNTIL NEXT

03:44:14.140 --> 03:44:16.176
WEEK AND SO ONE I THINK VERY

03:44:16.242 --> 03:44:17.677
IMPORTANT PREMISE HERE.

03:44:17.744 --> 03:44:18.978
IS THAT THERE IS A DIFFERENCE

03:44:19.045 --> 03:44:21.181
BETWEEN RESTRICTING THE AMOUNT

03:44:21.247 --> 03:44:23.750
OF FUNDS AVAILABLE TO THE AND

03:44:23.817 --> 03:44:24.017
EMPLOYEE.

03:44:24.083 --> 03:44:26.286
VERSUS GIVING HER WHAT IS

03:44:26.352 --> 03:44:27.754
ALREADY HERS AND WHAT SHE'S

03:44:27.821 --> 03:44:29.222
ALREADY AREN'T.

03:44:29.289 --> 03:44:30.290
I UNDERSTAND AS A BROADER

03:44:30.356 --> 03:44:31.758
DIALOGUE TO BE HAD AROUND THAT

03:44:31.825 --> 03:44:34.093
TOPIC BUT I THINK THAT IS ONE

03:44:34.160 --> 03:44:36.162
THING THAT I WOULD JUST MARK --

03:44:36.229 --> 03:44:39.065
AS ONE IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION

03:44:39.132 --> 03:44:41.034
AS WE AS WE MOVE FORWARD IN THIS

03:44:41.100 --> 03:44:43.236
SPACE.

03:44:43.303 --> 03:44:46.873
OF FROM THE SUPPORT IS THE BILL.

03:44:46.940 --> 03:44:49.475
APPETITE THANK YOU -- THE IT

03:44:49.542 --> 03:44:51.277
JUST BE FROM BE ACTIVE.

03:44:51.344 --> 03:44:52.245
TOOL FOR SO FIRST AND FOREMOST I

03:44:52.312 --> 03:44:53.413
WANT TO ALLEVIATE TO CONCERN A

03:44:53.479 --> 03:44:54.848
PERCEPTION THAT YOU KNOW THIS

03:44:54.914 --> 03:44:56.149
WAS A ONE ONE COMPANY BILL

03:44:56.216 --> 03:44:58.384
BECAUSE THE FACT OF THE MATTER

03:44:58.451 --> 03:45:00.353
IS THE BILL CONSIST OR OR

03:45:00.420 --> 03:45:01.654
CONSISTENT TALES.

03:45:01.721 --> 03:45:02.722
A BUSINESS MODEL THAT WE DON'T

03:45:02.789 --> 03:45:06.626
EVEN OPERATE AS AN EXAMPLE --

03:45:06.693 --> 03:45:07.227
BECAUSE THE DIRECT TO CONSUMER

03:45:07.293 --> 03:45:09.295
MODEL FOOL V. BEEF LOOK FORWARD

03:45:09.362 --> 03:45:10.063
TO WORKING WITH ALL THE

03:45:10.129 --> 03:45:12.365
STAKEHOLDERS -- AND WE HAVE BEEN

03:45:12.432 --> 03:45:18.371
WORKING WITH THEM AND Vì WOULD

03:45:18.438 --> 03:45:20.540
LIKE TO CONTINUE DOING THAT

03:45:20.607 --> 03:45:20.840
[inaudible]

03:45:20.907 --> 03:45:24.811
OUR HOT ON ACCESS TO OWN BRIDGES

03:45:24.878 --> 03:45:26.412
IS THAT IT NEEDS TO BE GIVEN IN

03:45:26.479 --> 03:45:27.947
A RESPONSIBLE MANNER -- NOT

03:45:28.014 --> 03:45:29.315
UNRESTRICTED MANNER SO YES WE

03:45:29.382 --> 03:45:30.183
CAN WORK ON THE FREQUENCY OF

03:45:30.250 --> 03:45:31.885
GIVING MAYBE MORE FREQUENCY THAN

03:45:31.951 --> 03:45:33.786
WHAT THE BILL TODAY ALLOWS.

03:45:33.853 --> 03:45:35.355
BUT BE PHILOSOPHICALLY OR

03:45:35.421 --> 03:45:37.690
PRACTICALLY DO NOT BELIEVE THAT

03:45:37.757 --> 03:45:39.826
PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE ACCESS -- TO

03:45:39.893 --> 03:45:41.661
AND INCOME WITHOUT ANY

03:45:41.728 --> 03:45:43.096
RESTRICTION -- THEY SHOULD BE

03:45:43.162 --> 03:45:43.930
SOME GUARDRAILS IT SHOULD BE

03:45:43.997 --> 03:45:45.565
GIVEN IN A RESPONSIBLE MANNER

03:45:45.632 --> 03:45:49.035
BECAUSE BE HERE REALLY.

03:45:49.102 --> 03:45:50.069
AT THIS POINT TO BE A NOT

03:45:50.136 --> 03:45:52.572
PREPARED TO GET PAID EVERY DAY

03:45:52.639 --> 03:45:53.606
AND WE HAVE DONE SOME HUMAN

03:45:53.673 --> 03:45:55.575
CENTERED DESIGN STUDIES ON IT --

03:45:55.642 --> 03:45:59.646
AND SO YOU DO NOT WANT TO BE IN

03:45:59.712 --> 03:46:01.881
A SITUATION WHERE A PERSON.

03:46:01.948 --> 03:46:03.383
VINDICATE PAID ON PAYDAY THEY

03:46:03.449 --> 03:46:05.418
HAVE A ZERO CHECK.

03:46:05.485 --> 03:46:07.787
CORRECT SOLD THAT'S KIND OF J.

03:46:07.854 --> 03:46:08.354
BUT GIVEN THE MIDDLE GROUND

03:46:08.421 --> 03:46:09.289
GIVEN TO WORK WITH THEM

03:46:09.355 --> 03:46:10.256
ABSOLUTELY -- BUT

03:46:10.323 --> 03:46:11.824
PHILOSOPHICALLY V. BELIEVE --

03:46:11.891 --> 03:46:12.992
AND WHAT OUR PRACTICE AND

03:46:13.059 --> 03:46:14.327
PRODUCT SHOWS THAT RESPONSIBLE

03:46:14.394 --> 03:46:18.431
AXIS IS THE WAY TO PROCEED.

03:46:18.498 --> 03:46:20.233
SENATOR OF Y. CASKEY WERE

03:46:20.300 --> 03:46:22.268
SMILING THE ONE STATION THEM

03:46:22.335 --> 03:46:24.237
FALL BY SENATOR STERN IS I THINK.

03:46:24.304 --> 03:46:25.505
AS I UNDERSTAND THE BILL IT'S

03:46:25.571 --> 03:46:27.740
LIKE NOT STICK THERE ARE SIX

03:46:27.807 --> 03:46:29.475
PLAYERS IN THIS BUSINESS.

03:46:29.542 --> 03:46:30.810
SOME OF THEM HAVE DIRECT

03:46:30.877 --> 03:46:32.946
CONSUMER ACCESS THEY TALK TO THE

03:46:33.012 --> 03:46:34.314
CONSUMER AND THEY SAY CONSUMER

03:46:34.380 --> 03:46:36.549
YOU DECIDE WHAT MONEY YOU WANT

03:46:36.616 --> 03:46:37.617
TO TAKE OUT OF YOUR YOUR

03:46:37.684 --> 03:46:39.585
PAYCHECK THE OTHERS WORK WITH

03:46:39.652 --> 03:46:41.821
THE WITH THE EMPLOYERS AND THEY

03:46:41.888 --> 03:46:43.389
ACCESS THE EMPLOYERS.

03:46:43.456 --> 03:46:46.159
YOUR BUSINESS ALLOWS.

03:46:46.225 --> 03:46:47.994
PEOPLE TO COME IN EVERY DAY TAKE

03:46:48.061 --> 03:46:49.996
OUT EVERYONE F. AS MUCH MONEY AS

03:46:50.063 --> 03:46:51.965
THE URINE IN AS ACT TO PAY HAS

03:46:52.031 --> 03:46:54.767
SAID WHICH WE HAVE SO YOU COULD.

03:46:54.834 --> 03:46:56.369
GET TO PAY THE WITH ZERO YOU'RE

03:46:56.436 --> 03:46:58.171
A FREE MARKET MODEL WHICH IS YOU

03:46:58.237 --> 03:46:59.772
KNOW OKAY THAT SO I DON'T

03:46:59.839 --> 03:47:02.241
BELIEVE THAT.

03:47:02.308 --> 03:47:04.510
THE BILL IN ANY OF IN ANY WAY

03:47:04.577 --> 03:47:06.779
LIMITS THE SIX DIFFERENT PLAYERS

03:47:06.846 --> 03:47:07.747
YOU KNOW YOU JUST WANT TO MAKE

03:47:07.814 --> 03:47:10.350
SURE THAT YOU YOU HAVE ACCESS TO

03:47:10.416 --> 03:47:10.550
DO IT.

03:47:10.616 --> 03:47:13.252
IT'S POTENTIALLY UP TO THE

03:47:13.319 --> 03:47:15.321
EMPLOYER THAT WILL SAY I DON'T

03:47:15.388 --> 03:47:17.657
WANT YOU TO HAVE FIFTY FOR A

03:47:17.724 --> 03:47:18.825
100% OF YOUR PAY DOWN IN VERY

03:47:18.891 --> 03:47:20.193
DAY TAKE MONEY OUT THAT'S AN

03:47:20.259 --> 03:47:21.461
EMPLOYER.

03:47:21.527 --> 03:47:23.596
AGREEMENT WITH THE EMPLOYER AND

03:47:23.663 --> 03:47:25.765
THEN THE QUESTION IS IS THAT IF

03:47:25.832 --> 03:47:27.133
CAN THE DOUBLE DIP CAN THE

03:47:27.200 --> 03:47:28.301
CONSUMER.

03:47:28.368 --> 03:47:30.870
USE ONE SERVICE THAT.

03:47:30.937 --> 03:47:32.438
AT THROUGH THEIR EMPLOYER TO

03:47:32.505 --> 03:47:34.841
ACTIVATE UP 250% AND THEN GO

03:47:34.907 --> 03:47:37.443
AROUND AND GO WITH THE CONSUMER --

03:47:37.510 --> 03:47:38.378
TO THE DIRECT TO THE CONSUMER

03:47:38.444 --> 03:47:40.780
MODEL AND TAKE MORE I MEAN I

03:47:40.847 --> 03:47:41.814
GUESS.

03:47:41.881 --> 03:47:44.017
MY ECONOMY OR ECONOMICS

03:47:44.083 --> 03:47:45.518
PROFESSOR WOULD SAY THAT'S UP TO

03:47:45.585 --> 03:47:47.086
THE CONSUMER RIGHT AT ME.

03:47:47.153 --> 03:47:48.021
BUT I'D.

03:47:48.087 --> 03:47:50.623
IS THAT A FEAR REPRESENTATION WE

03:47:50.690 --> 03:47:52.191
ARE IN THIS BILL TODAY.

03:47:52.258 --> 03:47:53.292
YEAH JUST ONE SMALL

03:47:53.359 --> 03:47:54.827
CLARIFICATION AND PLEASE CORRECT

03:47:54.894 --> 03:47:57.397
ME IF I'M IF I HAVE THIS WRONG.

03:47:57.463 --> 03:47:58.931
I THINK THE BILL TECHNICALLY AS

03:47:58.998 --> 03:48:00.333
A THREAT AND DOES HAVE A

03:48:00.400 --> 03:48:03.403
STATUTORY LIMITATION OF 50% --

03:48:03.469 --> 03:48:04.637
HOWEVER THE POINT THAT YOU'VE

03:48:04.704 --> 03:48:06.572
MADE IS A GOOD ONE SENATOR WHICH

03:48:06.639 --> 03:48:07.340
IS.

03:48:07.407 --> 03:48:09.175
OFTENTIMES IN THESE MODELS YOU

03:48:09.242 --> 03:48:11.077
DO WHAT THE EMPLOYER CHOOSE.

03:48:11.144 --> 03:48:11.677
AND SO CERTAINLY WE WOULD BE

03:48:11.744 --> 03:48:13.179
SUPPORTIVE OF JUST HAVING THE

03:48:13.246 --> 03:48:14.680
EMPLOYER CHOOSE THE EMPLOYER

03:48:14.747 --> 03:48:16.749
TYPICALLY KNOWS -- THE EMPLOYEE

03:48:16.816 --> 03:48:18.785
BASE THE PAST -- THEY HAVE A

03:48:18.851 --> 03:48:20.820
BUILT IN INCENTIVE TO DO THINGS

03:48:20.887 --> 03:48:22.121
THAT ARE RIGHT FOR THE EMPLOYEE

03:48:22.188 --> 03:48:25.591
BASE -- AND SO CERTAINLY WE

03:48:25.658 --> 03:48:26.125
THINK THAT WOULD BE A GOOD

03:48:26.192 --> 03:48:28.961
COMPROMISE [inaudible]

03:48:29.028 --> 03:48:31.497
SENATOR STERN.

03:48:31.564 --> 03:48:32.999
THANK YOU MENTORED IN LIGHT OF

03:48:33.066 --> 03:48:35.468
THE AGNOSTICISM THAT I FEEL IS

03:48:35.535 --> 03:48:37.003
THE INTENSE [inaudible]

03:48:37.070 --> 03:48:39.172
MY COLLEAGUE.

03:48:39.238 --> 03:48:39.772
MENTION I'M HAPPY TO MOVE THE

03:48:39.839 --> 03:48:43.209
BILL.

03:48:43.276 --> 03:48:46.479
OTHER COMMENTS -- I APPRECIATE

03:48:46.546 --> 03:48:47.780
THIS WE NEED TO HAVE THIS

03:48:47.847 --> 03:48:49.582
DISCUSSION I'M NOT SURE WE'RE

03:48:49.649 --> 03:48:51.217
GOING TO COME TO THE RESOLUTION.

03:48:51.284 --> 03:48:53.386
OF BLOOD WITH THE COMMITMENT

03:48:53.453 --> 03:48:54.153
THAT YOU WILL KEEP WORKING ON

03:48:54.220 --> 03:48:55.955
THIS -- AND THAT THIS DOES NOT

03:48:56.022 --> 03:48:59.859
REFLECT A BIAS IN FAVOR OF ONE

03:55:20.873 --> 03:55:22.942
THAT YOU COULD HAVE FOLKS ON WHO

03:55:23.008 --> 03:55:24.977

THEY'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT

03:55:34.920 --> 03:55:36.555
MIGHT DISSUADE THEM SO I THINK

03:55:36.622 --> 03:55:38.657
THAT THAT IS HELPFUL IN THAT

03:55:38.724 --> 03:55:39.291

IF THERE WERE A SITUATION DOWN

03:55:41.794 --> 03:55:43.996
THE ROAD WHERE.

03:55:44.063 --> 03:55:49.201
SOMEONE'S MENTAL CONDITION --

03:55:49.268 --> 03:55:51.003
WOULD REVEAL ITSELF -- AND THAT

03:55:51.070 --> 03:55:51.670
INDIVIDUALS ARE ABLE TO PROVIDE

03:55:51.737 --> 03:55:54.607
ADEQUATE COUNSEL TO THE CLIENT --

03:55:54.673 --> 03:55:57.076
WOULD THERE BE A SITUATION WHERE

03:55:57.142 --> 03:55:58.744
AT ANY POINT THERE THROUGH

03:55:58.811 --> 03:56:00.913

THAT POINT.

03:56:06.352 --> 03:56:07.853

03:56:07.920 --> 03:56:10.022
GOOD QUESTION AND I DON'T KNOW

YOU'RE BEING DISCIPLINED AND AND

03:56:24.570 --> 03:56:25.971

FACT OF THE BILL -- I KNOW

04:16:42.720 --> 04:16:43.921

THE GOOD ONES IS IT UNLESS YOU

04:16:59.637 --> 04:17:03.174
HAVE A NEIGHBORHOOD GROUP WHO

04:17:03.241 --> 04:17:03.941

04:17:06.511 --> 04:17:07.211
VIOLATING SEQUEL.

04:17:07.278 --> 04:17:08.780

04:17:19.157 --> 04:17:19.957
BECAUSE DEVELOPERS WANT TO

04:17:20.024 --> 04:17:21.492
DEVELOP COMMUNITIES WANT

04:17:21.559 --> 04:17:23.494
DEVELOPMENT THAT IS GOOD AND

04:17:23.561 --> 04:17:24.061
PROPER.

04:17:24.128 --> 04:17:25.930
SO WHAT I SO SINCE THAT TIME

04:17:25.997 --> 04:17:27.165
FOURTEEN YEARS AGO I HAVE

04:17:27.231 --> 04:17:29.300
WATCHED THE DEVELOPMENT OF THESE.

04:17:29.367 --> 04:17:29.867
THESE FOLKS TO FIGHT THESE

04:17:29.934 --> 04:17:31.035
BATTLES.

04:17:31.102 --> 04:17:32.737
I'M SURE THERE ARE NEWBIES.

04:17:32.804 --> 04:17:34.305
THE PEOPLE THAT I HAVE SEEN DO

04:17:34.372 --> 04:17:35.640
THIS OVER THE YEARS THROUGHOUT

04:17:35.706 --> 04:17:38.409
CALIFORNIA ARE COURAGEOUS CIVIC

04:17:38.476 --> 04:17:39.911
MINDED PEOPLE IF MORE

04:17:39.977 --> 04:17:41.412
CALIFORNIANS WERE IS DEDICATED

04:17:41.479 --> 04:17:43.648
TO SOME OF THE FOLKS.

04:17:43.714 --> 04:17:44.615
THAT ENGAGE IN THESE LAWSUITS.

04:17:44.682 --> 04:17:46.484
WE WOULD BE A FABULOUS FABULOUS

04:17:46.551 --> 04:17:47.185
STATE.

04:17:47.251 --> 04:17:49.487
SO THE EFFECT OF THIS BILL

04:17:49.554 --> 04:17:50.988
BECAUSE THESE ARE NEIGHBORHOODS

04:17:51.055 --> 04:17:53.224
THESE ARE JUST REGULAR PEOPLE.

04:17:53.291 --> 04:17:54.392
WHEN THEY ARE FACED WITH THE

04:17:54.458 --> 04:17:55.793
POSSIBILITY?

04:17:55.860 --> 04:17:57.929
OF BEING SANCTIONED OR HAVING TO

04:17:57.995 --> 04:17:58.729
PAY THE OTHER SIDE'S ATTORNEYS'

04:17:58.796 --> 04:18:00.598
FEES THESE ARE DAVID VERSUS

04:18:00.665 --> 04:18:02.333
GOLIATH BATTLES TO BEGIN WITH.

04:18:02.400 --> 04:18:04.435
IS THAT THESE ACTIONS WILL NOT

04:18:04.502 --> 04:18:07.071
BE BROUGHT THERE ARE FAR BETTER

04:18:07.138 --> 04:18:10.041
WAYS. TO DEAL WITH THESE ISSUES

04:18:10.107 --> 04:18:11.909
THESE ARE JUST READ ACTIONS.

04:18:11.976 --> 04:18:13.211
PASSED LEGISLATION TO SPEED

04:18:13.277 --> 04:18:15.446

TAKE CARE OF ANY PROBLEM WITH

04:18:16.380 --> 04:18:18.149
ANY BASIS LAWSUITS OR EVEN

04:18:18.216 --> 04:18:19.383
LAWSUITS THAT ARE BASIS BUT JUST

04:18:19.450 --> 04:18:20.585
NEED TO BE LITIGATED.

04:18:20.651 --> 04:18:22.220
BUT THIS IS GOING TO HAVE THE

04:18:22.286 --> 04:18:24.956
WRONG OF FACT IT IS THE WRONG

04:18:25.022 --> 04:18:27.792

WITH FOLKS THAT -- WANTED TO

MAKE THIS BILL BETTER AND I

04:21:35.679 --> 04:21:38.082
THINK REALLY I IT SHOWS THAT WE

04:21:38.149 --> 04:21:40.151
WANT TO BE CONSENSUS BUILDERS

04:21:40.217 --> 04:21:43.187
EVEN ON ISSUES -- THAT CAN BE

04:21:43.254 --> 04:21:45.489
CONTROVERSIAL THE IDEAS WE WANT

04:21:45.556 --> 04:21:46.724
TO MOVE THE NEEDLE FORTY WE DO

04:21:46.791 --> 04:21:48.392
BELIEVE THAT THIS IS --

04:21:48.459 --> 04:21:51.429
IMPORTANT -- STEP IN IN DEALING

04:21:51.495 --> 04:21:52.229
WITH THE SOME OF THE SECRET

04:21:52.296 --> 04:21:53.564
CHALLENGE WE HAVE.

04:21:53.631 --> 04:21:56.367
AND MORE IMPORTANTLY ADDRESSING

04:21:56.434 --> 04:21:57.868
OUR HOUSING. TO GO DIRECTLY TO

04:21:57.935 --> 04:21:59.904
YOUR POINT -- AND I KNOW THAT MY

04:21:59.970 --> 04:22:02.606
MY MY COLLEAGUES HERE -- ARE

04:22:02.673 --> 04:22:04.341
ABLE TO COMMENT FURTHER BUT

04:22:04.408 --> 04:22:06.610
THERE ARE A COUPLE OF KEY POINTS

04:22:06.677 --> 04:22:08.012
THAT DIFFERENTIATE -- CIVIL

04:22:08.079 --> 04:22:09.847
PROCEDURE CODE ONE TWENTY EIGHT

04:22:09.914 --> 04:22:13.284
FROM FROM THIS ONE I SEE WHAT.

04:22:13.350 --> 04:22:14.718
RELATED SANCTIONS SHOULD

04:22:14.785 --> 04:22:16.787
APPROPRIATELY BE IN THE PUBLIC

04:22:16.854 --> 04:22:18.155
RESOURCES CODE.

04:22:18.222 --> 04:22:20.091
SO FAR I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO

04:22:20.157 --> 04:22:21.592
HAVE THAT OVER THERE -- THE

04:22:21.659 --> 04:22:25.930
SECOND IS A IMPRESSING UPON --

04:22:25.996 --> 04:22:28.232
CALIFORNIA THE IMPORTANCE OF

04:22:28.299 --> 04:22:30.968
HOUSING IN HOW WE BELIEVE BY

04:22:31.035 --> 04:22:32.036
VIRTUE OF THIS -- THAT

04:22:32.103 --> 04:22:33.370
LEGISLATION THE POLITICAL

04:22:33.437 --> 04:22:36.974
MESSAGES THAT WE WANT. TO

04:22:37.041 --> 04:22:37.908
PRESERVE SEQUEL BUT WE WANT TO

04:22:37.975 --> 04:22:38.943
MAKE CERTAIN THAT THERE ARE

04:22:39.009 --> 04:22:41.479
MERITORIOUS ACTIONS AND I THINK.

04:22:41.545 --> 04:22:43.814
WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT -- AND

04:22:43.881 --> 04:22:45.449
SEQUEL HAS BEEN USED BY BY

04:22:45.516 --> 04:22:47.685
CERTAIN FOLKS -- FOR DIFFERENT

04:22:47.751 --> 04:22:50.554
REASONS ALSO IT EXTENDS ODD TO

04:22:50.621 --> 04:22:51.956
CLAIMS.

04:22:52.022 --> 04:22:54.458
AND IT ALSO -- ON HAS -- OTHER

04:22:54.525 --> 04:22:56.127
MODIFICATIONS.

04:22:56.193 --> 04:22:57.261
BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY I THINK

04:22:57.328 --> 04:22:58.729
IT'S IT'S IT'S THAT WE BRING IT

04:22:58.796 --> 04:23:00.598
IN TO BRING THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE

04:23:00.664 --> 04:23:02.933
INTO THE PUBLIC RESOURCES --

04:23:03.000 --> 04:23:05.035
CODE AND WITH THAT I'D MAYBE

04:23:05.102 --> 04:23:06.704
I'LL PASS OVER.

04:23:06.770 --> 04:23:07.605
MADAM CHAIR THEIR PERMISSION

04:23:07.671 --> 04:23:07.905
[inaudible]

04:23:07.972 --> 04:23:09.907
VERY BRIEFLY.

04:23:09.974 --> 04:23:11.542
THE DISTINGUISHING FACTOR WITH

04:23:11.609 --> 04:23:13.310
ONE TWENTY POINT FIVE IS IT

04:23:13.377 --> 04:23:15.012
INCLUDES THE BOARD'S SOLE

04:23:15.079 --> 04:23:17.014
PURPOSE WHICH THE COURTS HAVE

04:23:17.081 --> 04:23:18.382
INTERPRETED AS A SUBJECTIVE

04:23:18.449 --> 04:23:20.885
STANDARD VERY DIFFICULT TO PROVE

04:23:20.951 --> 04:23:22.419
UNDERSEA WHEN YOU BRING --

04:23:22.486 --> 04:23:23.687
NUMEROUS CLAIMS I THINK THE

04:23:23.754 --> 04:23:26.157
ISSUE ITS SOLE PURPOSE TO HARASS

04:23:26.223 --> 04:23:28.492
THIS BILL -- ADDRESSES REALLY

04:23:28.559 --> 04:23:30.561
JUST MERITLESS SEQUEL CLAIMS AND

04:23:30.628 --> 04:23:31.695
ACTIONS SO IT'S ALITTLE BIT

04:23:31.762 --> 04:23:33.264
BROADER IN THAT SENSE BUT NARAL

04:23:33.330 --> 04:23:35.432
ANOTHER SENSE THAT WE CAN SPEAK --

04:23:35.499 --> 04:23:36.867
TO ALSO ONE TWENTY POINT FIVE IS

04:23:36.934 --> 04:23:38.202
NOT A UNIVERSAL SANCTIONS

04:23:38.269 --> 04:23:40.304
STATUTE THAT ALL DIFFERENT LAWS

04:23:40.371 --> 04:23:41.505
RELY UPON FOR EXAMPLE YOU THE

04:23:41.572 --> 04:23:43.107
FEE SHIFTING STATUTES UNDER THE

04:23:44.441 --> 04:23:46.911
UNDER GOVERNMENT CODE.

04:23:46.977 --> 04:23:47.511
ONE TWO NINE SIX FIVE AND ALSO

04:23:47.578 --> 04:23:48.679
UNDER THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER

04:23:48.746 --> 04:23:51.982
LEGAL REMEDIES ACT UNDER -- CCP

04:23:52.049 --> 04:23:53.083
SEVENTEEN EIGHTY THERE'S ALSO IF

04:23:53.150 --> 04:23:53.751
YOU SERVED IN STATUTE AND SO TO

04:23:53.817 --> 04:23:54.451
THE SENATOR'S POINT IT'S

04:23:54.518 --> 04:23:55.853
IMPORTANT TO HOW IS IT.

04:23:55.920 --> 04:23:56.854
IN THE LAWN WHICH WERE DEALING

04:23:56.921 --> 04:23:58.455

04:25:30.681 --> 04:25:31.949
EXAMPLE WITH THE RIPPER SEATING

04:25:32.016 --> 04:25:33.584
TO PRODUCE DOCUMENTS THAT SHOULD

04:25:33.651 --> 04:25:34.184
BE PART OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE

04:25:34.251 --> 04:25:34.885
RECORD.

04:25:34.952 --> 04:25:35.886
DISCOVERY SANCTIONS ARE

04:25:35.953 --> 04:25:37.788
REGULARLY -- IMPOSED BY TRIAL

ANYONE TO FURTHER EXPOUND ON

04:25:48.966 --> 04:25:49.800
THAT WELL I THINK -- WHAT WE

04:25:49.867 --> 04:25:53.070
HEARD OF -- IS THAT -- DOES NOT

04:25:53.137 --> 04:25:56.140
SEEM TO BE A RECORD -- THAT --

04:25:56.206 --> 04:25:57.708
ONE TWENTY EIGHT POINT FIVE IS

04:25:57.775 --> 04:26:00.844
ACTIVELY USED -- I THINK.

04:26:00.911 --> 04:26:02.513
I THINK IT IS IT IS ENTIRELY

04:26:02.579 --> 04:26:03.714
APPROPRIATE.

04:26:03.781 --> 04:26:05.349
THAT IF WE DO BELIEVE THAT THERE

04:26:05.416 --> 04:26:06.350
IS A HOUSING CRISIS IN

04:26:06.417 --> 04:26:08.118
CALIFORNIA AND WE'RE

04:26:08.185 --> 04:26:09.787
INTELLECTUALLY HONEST IN

04:26:09.853 --> 04:26:11.155
THINKING.

04:26:11.221 --> 04:26:13.157
THAT I THAT THE DELAYS IN THE

04:26:13.223 --> 04:26:16.427
COST OVERRUNS THAT OCCUR WITH

04:26:16.493 --> 04:26:22.566
ODD THESE SAYS SEEK RELATED --

04:26:22.633 --> 04:26:23.834
MATTERS.

04:26:23.901 --> 04:26:25.169
IT STANDS TO REASON THAT IF YOU

04:26:25.235 --> 04:26:27.738
REDUCE THE SEQUEL LAWSUITS AND

04:26:27.805 --> 04:26:29.606
THERE WAS AT HALL IN THE NIGHT --

04:26:29.673 --> 04:26:30.607
STUDY IN MY JOB MIND YOU THAT

04:26:30.674 --> 04:26:32.743
WAS DURING THE RECESSION THAT WE

04:26:32.810 --> 04:26:36.146
HAD ABOUT -- SIX HUNDRED MATTERS

04:26:36.213 --> 04:26:37.548
THAT WERE -- THAT WERE A LITTLE

04:26:37.614 --> 04:26:40.451
PIECE OF LITIGATION THAT WERE

04:26:40.517 --> 04:26:41.318
FILED WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL.

04:26:41.385 --> 04:26:42.653
THAT'S ROUGHLY TWO HUNDRED PER

04:26:42.720 --> 04:26:43.754
YEAR THAT WAS DURING THE

04:26:43.821 --> 04:26:46.023
RECESSION SO I THINK AS TIME

04:26:46.090 --> 04:26:47.291
GOES ON WILL.

04:26:47.358 --> 04:26:49.293
IF ANYONE IS SERVED ANY TIME IN

04:26:49.360 --> 04:26:51.028
LOCAL POLITICS WHETHER BE THE

04:26:51.095 --> 04:26:52.496
CITY OR A COUNTY.

04:26:52.563 --> 04:26:54.031
WE SEE HOW IT'S USED THE PROBLEM

04:26:54.098 --> 04:26:56.467
IS I AGREE THAT SEQUEL IS

04:26:56.533 --> 04:26:58.001
TERRIBLY IMPORTANT.

04:26:58.068 --> 04:26:59.436
IN THIS IS ONE WAY OF MAKING

04:26:59.503 --> 04:27:01.238
CERTAIN THAT SEQUEL IS REMAINS

04:27:01.305 --> 04:27:02.373
INTACT.

04:27:02.439 --> 04:27:04.308
BUT THAT PEOPLE ARE DOING ARE

04:27:04.375 --> 04:27:06.543
ACTING IN THE BEST INTEREST OF

04:27:06.610 --> 04:27:09.113
THE COMMUNITY AND ON THE MERITS.

04:27:09.179 --> 04:27:11.315
SO FINAL QUESTION IN YOUR REVIEW

04:27:11.382 --> 04:27:13.183
OF ALL THOSE CASES.

04:27:13.250 --> 04:27:14.852

IS.

04:27:29.366 --> 04:27:30.701
IS BECAUSE IT MAY BE IN PRINT

04:27:30.768 --> 04:27:32.703

04:30:48.365 --> 04:30:50.300
IF IT IF INDIVIDUALS OR GROUPS

04:30:50.367 --> 04:30:52.769
OR COMMUNITIES WANT TO

04:30:52.836 --> 04:30:54.471
CHALLENGER PROJECT -- UNDER SEEK

04:30:54.538 --> 04:30:55.539
WERE [inaudible]

04:30:55.606 --> 04:30:57.741
THEY SHOULD.

04:30:57.808 --> 04:30:58.308
THEY JUST NEED TO BE ON THE

04:30:58.375 --> 04:30:59.910
MERITS.

04:30:59.977 --> 04:31:01.745
AND I THINK WHAT HAPPENS IN IT

04:31:01.812 --> 04:31:03.280
WITH WITH A LESS SELECTIVE

04:31:03.347 --> 04:31:05.816
READING IT IS BAD FAITH.

04:31:05.882 --> 04:31:09.820
AND I IN USING THIS TO INTENDED

04:31:09.886 --> 04:31:11.421
FOR DELAYS.

04:31:11.488 --> 04:31:13.123
AND I THINK THAT'S WHERE WE HAVE

04:31:13.190 --> 04:31:15.826
A BIG SEPARATION HERE YOU AND I

04:31:15.892 --> 04:31:19.029
PHILOSOPHICALLY IS THAT -- I

04:31:19.096 --> 04:31:21.365
WANT TO SEE WHAT MATTERS TO GO

04:31:21.431 --> 04:31:23.100
TO LITIGATION PROCESS I JUST

04:31:23.166 --> 04:31:24.768
WANT THEM TO BE ON THE MERITS

04:31:24.835 --> 04:31:26.169
BECAUSE IF THEY'RE ON THE MERITS

04:31:26.236 --> 04:31:29.706
THERE ARE NO ATTORNEYS FEES.

04:31:29.773 --> 04:31:31.642
BUT IN LITIGATION.

04:31:31.708 --> 04:31:32.809
YOU KNOW PEOPLE THROW THE

04:31:32.876 --> 04:31:34.144
KITCHEN SINK IN AND THEIR

04:31:34.211 --> 04:31:35.445
PLEADINGS AND THEY PLEAD

04:31:35.512 --> 04:31:37.648
EVERYTHING IN AN ABUNDANCE OF

04:31:37.714 --> 04:31:40.484
CAUTION AND WHAT WHAT IT APPEARS

04:31:40.550 --> 04:31:41.151
THAT THIS.

04:31:41.218 --> 04:31:43.387
THIS LANGUAGE WOULD HAVE IS THAT

04:31:43.453 --> 04:31:44.821
YOU MAY NOT HAVE CAUSES OF

04:31:44.888 --> 04:31:46.356
ACTIONS BECAUSE YOU'RE WORRYING

04:31:46.423 --> 04:31:49.292
DAD YOU MAY BE SECOND GUESSED BY.

04:31:49.359 --> 04:31:51.228
THE DEVELOPER WHO WANTS TO BUILD

04:31:51.294 --> 04:31:52.796
THE PROJECT THAT YOU'RE SIMPLY

04:31:52.863 --> 04:31:55.198
DELAYING IT SO YOU DON'T HAVE

04:31:55.265 --> 04:31:56.400
FORTY SEVEN CAUSES OF ACTION YOU

04:31:56.466 --> 04:32:00.103
HAVE. THREE EN EN THAT'S NOT

04:32:00.170 --> 04:32:01.638

04:32:01.705 --> 04:32:04.374
AREA OF THE LAW THAT I KNOW OF

04:32:04.441 --> 04:32:07.110

GIVE.

04:32:24.461 --> 04:32:25.228

04:32:25.295 --> 04:32:26.797
DEFINED IN THE PUBLIC RESOURCES

04:32:26.863 --> 04:32:27.964

INTERESTING THING TO WATCH

BECAUSE THAT I I FEEL LIKE WE

04:32:48.985 --> 04:32:50.053
HAVE THESE.

04:32:50.120 --> 04:32:51.288
EVERYYOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE

04:32:51.354 --> 04:32:52.456
BASICALLY IS IS TURN INTO

04:32:52.522 --> 04:32:54.524
LITIGATION OVER THE MERITS OF C.

04:32:54.591 --> 04:32:55.659
QUIET SEQUEL LAWSUITS IN GENERAL

04:32:55.726 --> 04:32:57.461
TO THAT WE HAVE THESE TWO

04:32:57.527 --> 04:32:58.862
ENORMOUS ARMIES THAT ARE HERE.

04:32:58.929 --> 04:33:00.564
AND AND AND YOU KNOW MAKING

04:33:00.630 --> 04:33:02.666
THEIR CASE -- BUT THEY'RE REALLY

04:33:02.733 --> 04:33:05.302
FIGHTING OVER CENTIMETER -- YOU

04:33:05.368 --> 04:33:06.803
KNOW THE END OF THE DAY HEY THIS

04:33:06.870 --> 04:33:09.106
BILL -- SO WHEN WHEN THIS BILL

04:33:09.172 --> 04:33:11.541
CAME TO YOU Q.. FIVE YOU KNOW

04:33:11.608 --> 04:33:13.710
THE SENATOR WANTED.

04:33:13.777 --> 04:33:15.712
TO TEST OUT THE POSSIBILITY THAT

04:33:15.779 --> 04:33:17.013
YOU'RE LOOKING AT THIS AND A

04:33:17.080 --> 04:33:18.381
POSSIBILITY OF OF AN AND

04:33:18.448 --> 04:33:19.783
REASONABLE AS STANDARD.

04:33:19.850 --> 04:33:21.718
AND I THINK WE WERE WILLING --

04:33:21.785 --> 04:33:23.520
TO LET THAT BE TESTED OUT HERE

04:33:23.587 --> 04:33:24.554
IN JUDICIARY BECAUSE WE KNOW THE

04:33:24.621 --> 04:33:26.156
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE DOES A GREAT

04:33:26.223 --> 04:33:27.390
JOB PROVIDING.

04:33:27.457 --> 04:33:29.292
DETAILED ANALYSIS TO LOOK AT THE

04:33:29.359 --> 04:33:31.795
RAMIFICATIONS IMPLICATIONS OF

04:33:31.862 --> 04:33:34.364
THE USE OF THAT TERM -- IN A IN

04:33:34.431 --> 04:33:36.032
AND ONCE AGAIN OF COURSE OUR OUR%

04:33:36.099 --> 04:33:38.001
GREAT STAFF HERE PRODUCED A

04:33:38.068 --> 04:33:38.602
SIXTEEN PAGE ANALYSIS THAT I

04:33:38.668 --> 04:33:39.703
READ CAREFULLY.

04:33:39.770 --> 04:33:41.571
AND I THINK YOU KNOW PARTLY AS A

04:33:41.638 --> 04:33:44.141
RESULT -- YOU ARE ASKED TO DROP

04:33:44.207 --> 04:33:47.477
THE AND REASONABLE IS STANDARD --

04:33:47.544 --> 04:33:48.812
FROM YOUR BILL.

04:33:48.879 --> 04:33:51.381
AND SO NOW THE BILL AND AN END

04:33:51.448 --> 04:33:52.816
VERY VERY SIGNIFICANTLY.

04:33:52.883 --> 04:33:55.552
YOU ASKED TO DROP THE SECOND

04:33:55.619 --> 04:33:57.721
SENTENCE OF YOUR BILL AS IT AS

04:33:57.788 --> 04:33:59.055
IT ORIGINALLY WAS LAID OUT.

04:33:59.122 --> 04:33:59.990
BECAUSE IT DID CREATE AN

04:34:00.056 --> 04:34:01.258
IMBALANCE OF STANDARDS BETWEEN

04:34:01.324 --> 04:34:03.160
THE PETITIONER AND THE DEVELOPER

04:34:03.226 --> 04:34:06.696
OR THE THE YEAH THE THE AGENCY

04:34:06.763 --> 04:34:07.664
THE LEAD AGENCY.

04:34:07.731 --> 04:34:10.167
AND THEY ACTUALLY TOOK

04:34:10.233 --> 04:34:11.735
DISCRETION AWAY FROM A JUDGE.

04:34:11.802 --> 04:34:12.335
OUR BY CREATING THIS KIND OF

04:34:12.402 --> 04:34:14.304
CONVOLUTED PERCENTAGE SYSTEM

04:34:14.371 --> 04:34:15.839
BASED ON THE CLAIMS I MEAN I

04:34:15.906 --> 04:34:18.375
ALSO DID A REALLY GOOD JOB OF OF

04:34:18.441 --> 04:34:20.010
OF AND EXPLAINING WHY THAT WAS A

04:34:20.076 --> 04:34:21.812
PROBLEM -- IT TALKS ABOUT THAT

04:34:21.878 --> 04:34:24.080
IN SECTION SIX WHICH IS ON PAGES

04:34:24.147 --> 04:34:24.714
TWELVE AND THIRTEEN OF THE

04:34:24.781 --> 04:34:25.982
ANALYSIS AND AND YOU KNOW FROM

04:34:26.049 --> 04:34:27.684
MY PERSPECTIVE THE ONLY REASON

04:34:27.751 --> 04:34:28.518
TO SUPPORT SOMETHING LIKE THIS

04:34:28.585 --> 04:34:29.286
IS TO GIVE.

04:34:29.352 --> 04:34:30.620
A LITTLE BIT MORE DISCRETION TO

04:34:30.687 --> 04:34:32.689
A JUDGE -- YOU KNOW WHO'S

04:34:32.756 --> 04:34:34.057
ACTUALLY GOT THE OPPORTUNITY TO

04:34:34.124 --> 04:34:35.625
LOOK AND EXAMINE THE ISSUES AT

04:34:35.692 --> 04:34:37.627
HAND AND THAT SECTION THAT YOU

04:34:37.694 --> 04:34:39.396
HAD IN YOUR BILL RELATING -- TO

04:34:39.462 --> 04:34:40.664
THE THE CLAIMS AND AND

04:34:40.730 --> 04:34:42.199
PERCENTAGES TOOK AWAY DISCRETION

04:34:42.265 --> 04:34:46.102
SO -- I I I THINK THAT -- IN THE

04:34:46.169 --> 04:34:47.003
END OF THE DAY.

04:34:47.070 --> 04:34:49.706
WE ARE NOW WITH LANGUAGE

04:34:49.773 --> 04:34:50.006
[inaudible]

04:34:50.073 --> 04:34:52.042
THAT REQUIRES.

04:34:52.108 --> 04:34:55.712
A JUDGE TO HAVE A FINDING THAT

04:34:55.779 --> 04:34:57.480
THE PETITIONER ACTED IN BAD

04:34:57.547 --> 04:34:59.649
FAITH.

04:34:59.716 --> 04:35:00.784
SO IT -- IT FOR YOU FOR FOR

04:35:12.762 --> 04:35:14.564

HAVING THIS PROVISION IN -- THE

04:38:39.135 --> 04:38:41.571
PUBLIC RESOURCES CODE THAT IT

04:38:41.638 --> 04:38:43.573
DOES HAVE MATERIAL --

04:38:43.640 --> 04:38:45.141
DIFFERENCES IS A PUBLIC RESEARCH

THERE ARE THERE ARE THERE ARE

04:38:47.210 --> 04:38:49.312
MATERIAL DIFFERENCES -- SOLELY

04:38:49.379 --> 04:38:50.780

BUT I THINK -- IT IS IT IS IT IS

04:38:54.951 --> 04:38:55.618
IMPORTANT.

04:38:55.685 --> 04:38:58.988
THAT WE ALSO SET -- A STRONG

04:38:59.055 --> 04:39:02.325
MESSAGE THAT -- BECAUSE THIS IS

04:39:02.392 --> 04:39:06.162
&lt;c.magenta&gt;IMITED TO INFILL -- PROJECTS&lt;/c&gt;

04:39:06.229 --> 04:39:07.464
THAT WE ARE EMPHASIZING THE

04:39:07.530 --> 04:39:09.999
IMPORTANCE OF HOUSING GIVEN ARE

04:39:10.066 --> 04:39:11.534
GIVEN OUR OUR STATE DIFFERENT

04:39:11.601 --> 04:39:13.069
SYMBOLISM THERE I THINK I DID I

04:39:13.136 --> 04:39:15.438
FAIRS.

04:39:15.505 --> 04:39:20.510
AND YES YOU HAVE.

04:39:20.577 --> 04:39:21.811
THE COUPLE COMMENTS IT WILL.

04:39:21.878 --> 04:39:22.979
I WAS GOING TO ADD THE FACT THAT

04:39:23.046 --> 04:39:23.580
THIS BILL DOES NOT HAVE SOLELY

04:39:23.646 --> 04:39:24.280
IN IT COURTS INTERPRET ONE

04:39:24.347 --> 04:39:24.914
TWENTY EIGHT POINT FIVE WITH THE

04:39:24.981 --> 04:39:25.582
WORD SOLELY TO FIND A SUBJECTIVE

04:39:25.648 --> 04:39:25.882
BAD FAITH.

04:39:25.949 --> 04:39:26.983
WE'RE NOT NECESSARILY GOING TO

04:39:27.050 --> 04:39:28.685
FIND SUBJECT ABOUT FATE WERE

04:39:28.751 --> 04:39:29.953
SAYING FRIVOLOUS AND MERITLESS

04:39:30.019 --> 04:39:34.023
SEQUEL CLAIMS WOULD FALL UNDER.

04:39:34.090 --> 04:39:34.624
SIX FIVE NINE ONE TWENTY EIGHT

04:39:34.691 --> 04:39:35.592
HAS SOLELY IN IT WHICH HAS A

04:39:35.658 --> 04:39:37.760
HIGHER STANDARD THAT'S RIGHT SO

04:39:37.827 --> 04:39:38.928
IT LOWERS THE STANDARD.

04:39:38.995 --> 04:39:40.630
ON WHICH THE STANDBY LOAN

04:39:40.697 --> 04:39:41.664
MAINTAINING FIGHT BAD FAITH IN

04:39:41.731 --> 04:39:44.234
THAT AND FINALLY IT WAS THAT.

04:39:44.300 --> 04:39:46.503
IN AN EFFORT TO BUILD CONSENSUS

04:39:46.569 --> 04:39:48.805
I CERTAINLY TAKING IN THE

04:39:48.872 --> 04:39:50.807
RECOMMENDATIONS FROM -- MEMBERS

04:39:50.874 --> 04:39:52.408
OF THIS COMMITTEE AND THE LAST

04:39:52.475 --> 04:39:55.011
COMMITTEE -- I THINK I THINK

04:39:55.078 --> 04:39:56.279
IT'S CLEAR THAT WE WANT TO PUT

04:39:56.346 --> 04:40:00.116
FORWARD -- A PRODUCT THAT -- IS

04:40:00.183 --> 04:40:02.919
ABLE -- TO ACHIEVE CONSENSUS AND

04:40:02.986 --> 04:40:03.920
I THINK.

04:40:03.987 --> 04:40:06.256
CERTAIN THINGS WERE TAKEN OUT --

04:40:06.322 --> 04:40:07.157
NOT NECESSARILY BECAUSE WE

04:40:07.223 --> 04:40:09.125
WANTED TO BUT I IN ORDER TO MOVE

04:40:09.192 --> 04:40:10.760
THIS FORWARD IN MY LAST POINT IS

04:40:10.827 --> 04:40:12.162
THIS IS THAT.

04:40:12.228 --> 04:40:14.664
I AM PLEDGING TO CONTINUE TO

04:40:14.731 --> 04:40:17.767
WORK WITH -- WITH FOLKS I EVEN --

04:40:17.834 --> 04:40:19.802
YOU KNOW MY FRIEND MR DHEAS --

04:40:19.869 --> 04:40:21.671
FROM BUILDING TRADES AND OTHERS --

04:40:21.738 --> 04:40:23.406
IN THOSE ON THE THIS COMMITTEE

04:40:23.473 --> 04:40:27.477
IN THOSE SUBSEQUENT TO THIS.

04:40:27.544 --> 04:40:28.778
WAYS TO IMPROVE THIS -- AS IT

04:40:28.845 --> 04:40:29.579
GOES THROUGH THE PROCESS AND AS

04:40:29.646 --> 04:40:30.880
WE'VE DISCUSSED BEFORE.

04:40:30.947 --> 04:40:33.183
I THINK WHAT WE HAVE HERE IS AN

04:40:33.249 --> 04:40:35.685
OPPORTUNITY TO MOVE THIS FORWARD

04:40:35.752 --> 04:40:38.688
AND I WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH

04:40:38.755 --> 04:40:40.423
THE THE FOLKS ALL ALONG THE WAY

04:40:40.490 --> 04:40:40.990
TO TRY TO MAKE THIS A BETTER

04:40:41.057 --> 04:40:43.526
PRODUCT.

04:40:43.593 --> 04:40:44.827
IF YOU YES IF YOU LIKE TO

04:40:44.894 --> 04:40:46.863
RESPOND TO A COUPLE OF THINGS

04:40:46.930 --> 04:40:48.431
THE FIRST FULL OF ONE TWENTY

04:40:48.498 --> 04:40:49.566
EIGHT POINT FIVE DOESN'T WORK

04:40:49.632 --> 04:40:50.233
THERE'S NO REASON TO BELIEVE IT

04:40:50.300 --> 04:40:50.667
WOULD.

04:40:50.733 --> 04:40:52.435
INEQUIVALENT WOULD WORK IN THIS

04:40:52.502 --> 04:40:54.204
CONTEXT SECOND OF ALL IF WE'RE

04:40:54.270 --> 04:40:55.939
DEALING WITH A SEQUEL ACTIONS

04:40:56.005 --> 04:40:57.540
BETWEEN SOPHISTICATED LITIGANTS.

04:40:57.607 --> 04:40:58.875
THESE FINER POINTS ABOUT BAD

04:40:58.942 --> 04:41:00.310
FAITH OR NOT BAD FAITH THEY'RE

04:41:00.376 --> 04:41:01.411
NOT GONNA MATTER THEIR

04:41:01.477 --> 04:41:02.579
SOPHISTICATED LITIGANTS.

04:41:02.645 --> 04:41:05.014
WHAT THE IMPACT REALLY IS IS ON

04:41:05.081 --> 04:41:06.983
THE ON THE FOLKS THAT GO AROUND

04:41:07.050 --> 04:41:09.953
THE SAKE WOULD YOU PLEASE

04:41:10.019 --> 04:41:10.553
CONTRIBUTE TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS

04:41:10.620 --> 04:41:11.054
WE CAN?

04:41:11.120 --> 04:41:12.021
HIGHER SOMEWHERE TO GO AND AND

04:41:12.088 --> 04:41:12.922
LOOK INTO WHETHER OR NOT WE HAVE

04:41:12.989 --> 04:41:14.624
A SEQUEL CASE YOU TELL THESE

04:41:14.691 --> 04:41:17.493
FOLKS WHO DO REALLY GOOD WORK.

04:41:17.560 --> 04:41:19.429
THAT THEY MAY ALSO GET HIT WITH

04:41:19.495 --> 04:41:20.830
THE OTHER SIDE'S ATTORNEYS' FEES

04:41:20.897 --> 04:41:22.599
IF THEY LOSE.

04:41:22.665 --> 04:41:23.633
FORGET ABOUT IT THEY'RE NOT

04:41:23.700 --> 04:41:25.235
GONNA DO IT IT'S HARD ENOUGH TO

04:41:25.301 --> 04:41:26.903
GET THESE KINDS OF CIVIC

04:41:26.970 --> 04:41:28.538
ENGAGEMENT LAWSUIT OFF THE

04:41:28.605 --> 04:41:29.639
GROUND TO BEGIN WITH.

04:41:29.706 --> 04:41:31.574
AND SO THE END OF THE DAY THAT'S

04:41:31.641 --> 04:41:33.276
THE IMPACT OF THIS BILL AND

04:41:33.343 --> 04:41:35.245
REALLY IT'S NOT GONNA FACT THE

04:41:35.311 --> 04:41:36.446
PROBLEM I THINK WE ALL AGREE.

04:41:36.512 --> 04:41:38.348
EXIST WE WANT MORE AFFORDABLE

04:41:38.414 --> 04:41:39.382
HOUSING.

04:41:39.449 --> 04:41:40.316
I'M LIKE I DON'T A PLAYER THE

04:41:40.383 --> 04:41:41.017
POINT WITH THAT BUT THE THE

04:41:41.084 --> 04:41:43.086
ANALYSIS ACTUALLY SPECIFICALLY

04:41:43.152 --> 04:41:45.221
MENTIONED SIMON V. BMUS BROTHERS

04:41:45.288 --> 04:41:46.823
WHICH WHICH YOU KNOW BASICALLY

04:41:46.889 --> 04:41:47.890
MAKES THAT POSSIBILITY SO

04:41:47.957 --> 04:41:50.059
UNLIKELY I MEAN THE OF A JUDGE

04:41:50.126 --> 04:41:52.061
OF OF A JUDGE SMACKING DOWN A A

04:41:52.128 --> 04:41:53.062
GOOD FAITH.

04:41:53.129 --> 04:41:54.664
LET AGAIN I YOU KNOW BUT BUT THE

04:41:54.731 --> 04:41:55.932
POINT WHEN WHEN A WHEN A

04:41:55.999 --> 04:41:57.166
NEIGHBORHOOD GROUP IS FACED WITH

04:41:57.233 --> 04:41:59.102
THE QUESTION OF DO WE FILE A

04:41:59.168 --> 04:42:00.136
CASE OR NOT.

04:42:00.203 --> 04:42:01.471
RIGHT AND SOMEBODY EIGHT AND THE

04:42:01.537 --> 04:42:03.273
DEVELOPERS ALREADY SAID AND IF

04:42:03.339 --> 04:42:04.907
YOU WILL AFTER US WE'RE GOING TO

04:42:04.974 --> 04:42:05.908
SEE WHERE TO GET ATTORNEY'S FEES

04:42:05.975 --> 04:42:06.909
AGAINST YOU.

04:42:06.976 --> 04:42:08.111
THAT HAS A TREMENDOUS A CHILLING

04:42:08.177 --> 04:42:09.879
EFFECT ON REGULAR PEOPLE THAT'S

04:42:09.946 --> 04:42:11.614
MY POINT I I JUST I THINK THAT

04:42:11.681 --> 04:42:12.115
IS.

04:42:12.181 --> 04:42:14.183
AN EXAGGERATION WITH RESPECT

04:42:14.250 --> 04:42:15.885
GIVEN GIVEN THE SIMON CASE BUT

04:42:15.952 --> 04:42:16.686
THIS IS WHAT MAKES THE

04:42:16.753 --> 04:42:18.254
LEGISLATURE FINALLY GET TO FIGHT

04:42:18.321 --> 04:42:19.856
OVER KIND OF MINUSCULE --

04:42:19.922 --> 04:42:23.026
MINUSCULE CAM INCHES OF OF OF

04:42:23.092 --> 04:42:27.930
THESE MEN ARMS BATTLES.

04:42:27.997 --> 04:42:31.000
I'D OF SO I THINK -- I THINK THE

04:42:31.067 --> 04:42:31.934
THE THE THE POINT IS THIS BILL

04:42:32.001 --> 04:42:32.969
IS DESIGNED TO CREATE A CHILLING

04:42:33.036 --> 04:42:34.070
EFFECT.

04:42:34.137 --> 04:42:36.039
WE HAVE A LAW ONE TWENTY EIGHT

04:42:36.105 --> 04:42:38.608
POINT -- FIVE A J. JUDGES ARE

04:42:38.675 --> 04:42:40.943
NOT GOING TO BE -- TRICKED BY

04:42:41.010 --> 04:42:42.779
SOMETHING NOT BEING IN THE

04:42:42.845 --> 04:42:45.682
PUBLIC RESOURCES CODE -- IT

04:42:45.748 --> 04:42:47.383
WOULD WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE BY

04:42:47.450 --> 04:42:50.753
VIRTUE OF THIS BILL IS THAT IT

04:42:50.820 --> 04:42:51.187
DOES.

04:42:51.254 --> 04:42:52.522
LOWER THE STANDARD.

04:42:52.588 --> 04:42:54.090
AND TWO IF YOU WANT TO LOWER THE

04:42:54.157 --> 04:42:55.458
STANDARD THEN YOU SHOULD VOTE

04:42:55.525 --> 04:42:58.227
FOR THIS -- IF YOU DON'T WANT TO

04:42:58.294 --> 04:42:59.562
LOWER THE STANDARD -- YOU

04:42:59.629 --> 04:43:00.797
SHOULDN'T AND I I WOULD LIKE TO

04:43:00.863 --> 04:43:02.799
SAY THAT.

04:43:02.865 --> 04:43:03.633
I THINK WHAT WE THERE ARE TWO

04:43:03.700 --> 04:43:05.234
THINGS I WANT TO SAY ONE IS THAT

04:43:05.301 --> 04:43:07.003
HALL AND NIGHT REPORT HAS BEEN

04:43:07.070 --> 04:43:08.871
THE BOND.

04:43:08.938 --> 04:43:10.606
IT WAS DONE BY AN ATTORNEY WHO

04:43:10.673 --> 04:43:12.108
FOR THE TWENTY YEARS I'VE KNOWN

04:43:12.175 --> 04:43:13.643
HER HAS BEEN AN ANTI SINGLE

04:43:13.710 --> 04:43:14.577
PERSON.

04:43:14.644 --> 04:43:17.080
SO THERE'S NO OBJECTIVITY THERE

04:43:17.146 --> 04:43:18.614
WE DID HAVE A HEARING.

04:43:18.681 --> 04:43:19.782
WHERE WE BROUGHT IN THE

04:43:19.849 --> 04:43:20.917
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA

04:43:20.983 --> 04:43:22.618
BERKELEY WHICH HAS COMPLETED A

04:43:22.685 --> 04:43:23.586
SURVEY?

04:43:23.653 --> 04:43:26.322
WITHOUT ANY OF A PERSONAL

04:43:26.389 --> 04:43:28.224
INTEREST IN THE RESULTS THEY

04:43:28.291 --> 04:43:30.426
PRODUCE THE A SURVEY THAT I

04:43:30.493 --> 04:43:32.595
DON'T THINK IT CAN BE CHALLENGED

04:43:32.662 --> 04:43:36.299
IT'S IT'S A METHODOLOGY WAS --

04:43:36.366 --> 04:43:40.236
ACADEMIC AND WAS OBJECTIVE AND

04:43:40.303 --> 04:43:42.939
WE HAD THE BEST OF THE JUDGES

04:43:43.005 --> 04:43:45.742
COME IN WHO TRAINS SECRET JUDGES

04:43:45.808 --> 04:43:47.110
SAID SECORD.

04:43:47.176 --> 04:43:48.945
LITIGATION IS IS MINIMAL AT BEST

04:43:49.011 --> 04:43:51.914
WE WE WE DON'T GENERALLY SEE IT --

04:43:51.981 --> 04:43:54.016
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT EXPEDITING

04:43:54.083 --> 04:43:56.219
SECRET PROCEEDINGS WE'VE DONE

04:43:56.285 --> 04:43:57.286
THAT WE HAVE?

04:43:57.353 --> 04:43:58.955
DONE A NUMBER OF THINGS TO

04:43:59.021 --> 04:44:01.023
EXPEDITE THE PROCESS AND IN SOME

04:44:01.090 --> 04:44:02.859
INSTANCES NOW WE'VE GOT ADDED

04:44:02.925 --> 04:44:04.026
THE TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY DAY

04:44:04.093 --> 04:44:06.462
REQUIREMENT WHICH I THINK IS IS

04:44:06.529 --> 04:44:07.497
GOING TO BE A CHALLENGE FOR THE

04:44:07.563 --> 04:44:08.197
COURTS.

04:44:08.264 --> 04:44:10.133
BUT WE'RE TRYING TO DO WHAT IS

04:44:10.199 --> 04:44:12.001
APPROPRIATE TO DEAL WITH OUR

04:44:12.068 --> 04:44:14.337
HOUSING ISSUE TO THE EXTENT THAT.

04:44:14.404 --> 04:44:16.672
SHE QUIT IS A PROBLEM OR IS THE

04:44:16.739 --> 04:44:19.842
SOLUTION WE ALL WE NEED TO BUILD

04:44:19.909 --> 04:44:22.311
THREE MILLION UNITS IN THE STATE

04:44:22.378 --> 04:44:24.580
AND THAT ISN'T A SEQUEL PROBLEM.

04:44:24.647 --> 04:44:30.887
SO I THINK -- WE HAVE HERE -- AN

04:44:30.953 --> 04:44:32.155
ISSUE THAT -- I THINK THERE'S A

04:44:32.221 --> 04:44:34.424
POLITICAL A TONE TO THIS WE HAVE

04:44:34.490 --> 04:44:36.793
IF THERE ARE FRIVOLOUS LAWSUITS

04:44:36.859 --> 04:44:38.795
WE'VE GOT A LAW THAT PROTECTS.

04:44:38.861 --> 04:44:40.930
A ONE TWENTY EIGHT POINT FIVE TO

04:44:40.997 --> 04:44:42.498
THE EXTENT THAT THERE IT IS

04:44:42.565 --> 04:44:44.267
DETERMINED THAT THERE.

04:44:44.333 --> 04:44:47.170
ARE HAS BEEN BAD FAITH R. N. AS

04:44:47.236 --> 04:44:48.971
WAS POINTED OUT.

04:44:49.038 --> 04:44:51.974
LITIGATION IS THE ONLY RECOURSE

04:44:52.041 --> 04:44:54.177
FOR C. C<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt; WE DON'T HAVE A D.&lt;/c&gt;</u>

04:44:54.243 --> 04:44:58.181
FE H. WE DON'T HAVE A YEAH.

04:44:58.247 --> 04:44:59.715
ANY KIND OF ADMINISTRATIVE

04:44:59.782 --> 04:45:02.351
REMEDY THE ONLY WAY TO ADDRESS A

04:45:02.418 --> 04:45:03.586
SEQUEL ISSUE IS THROUGH

04:45:03.653 --> 04:45:05.288
LITIGATION SO IT'S NOT LIKE YOU

04:45:05.354 --> 04:45:07.323
BE HERE WE GO WE WANT TO SUE WE

04:45:07.390 --> 04:45:08.558
WANT TO DELAY THINGS.

04:45:08.624 --> 04:45:10.593
IT'S THE ONLY AVENUE THAT'S BEEN

04:45:10.660 --> 04:45:12.895
MADE AVAILABLE SO -- WHAT AND I

TO HOW TO MAKE SOMETHING WORK

04:45:20.503 --> 04:45:21.537

IT'S NOT INFILL IS TO FIND IN A

04:46:29.739 --> 04:46:31.240
NUMBER OF DIFFERENT WAYS IN A

04:46:31.307 --> 04:46:32.808
NUMBER OF DIFFERENT SECTIONS SO

04:46:32.875 --> 04:46:35.278
THERE'S NO SPECIFIC DEFINITION.

04:46:35.344 --> 04:46:37.880

04:46:59.702 --> 04:47:00.703
I HAVE A DEFINING THE PUBLIC

04:47:00.770 --> 04:47:03.739
RESOURCES CODE SECTION TWENTY

04:47:03.806 --> 04:47:09.545
ONE ZERO SIX ONE POINT

04:47:09.612 --> 04:47:09.845
[inaudible]

04:47:09.912 --> 04:47:10.947
THREE THAT.

04:47:11.013 --> 04:47:12.348
I MEAN I I THINK WE CAN GET THE

04:47:12.415 --> 04:47:14.016
TO GET A COPY OF THAT -- WHAT

04:47:14.083 --> 04:47:16.652
WHILE OTHERS MAY BE LOOKING AT

04:47:16.719 --> 04:47:22.325
IT -- THE CENTER CUBBY YEAR OFF.

04:47:22.391 --> 04:47:24.727
MADAM CHAIR I JUST -- I JUST

04:47:24.794 --> 04:47:26.762
WANTED TO KIND OF WAIT INTO THIS

04:47:26.829 --> 04:47:28.331
AND DO IT VERY QUICKLY BECAUSE I

04:47:28.397 --> 04:47:30.800
JUST DON'T I I DISAGREE WITH

04:47:30.866 --> 04:47:32.401
YOUR CHARACTERIZATION OF THE

04:47:32.468 --> 04:47:34.070
HEARING THAT WE HELD AND THE

04:47:34.136 --> 04:47:37.173
DATA THAT WAS PRESENTED -- AS

04:47:37.239 --> 04:47:38.507
THE JUSTIFICATION FOR NOT

04:47:38.574 --> 04:47:40.042
LOOKING AT THIS AREA AND I THINK

04:47:40.109 --> 04:47:41.844
I THINK WHAT YOU SEE IN THE

04:47:41.911 --> 04:47:42.511
COMMITTEE.

04:47:42.578 --> 04:47:44.680
IS THAT WE'RE REALLY STRUGGLING

04:47:44.747 --> 04:47:46.382
WITH LOOKING AT WHAT IS THE

04:47:46.449 --> 04:47:48.417
IMPACT THAT THAT IF WE ALL AGREE

04:47:48.484 --> 04:47:49.952
THAT SEEK WHAT DOES READ SOME

04:47:50.019 --> 04:47:51.821
REALLY IMPORTANT GOOD THINGS IN

04:47:51.887 --> 04:47:52.388
THE COMMUNITY AND THAT THE

04:47:52.455 --> 04:47:54.357
PROCESS. FOR GETTING PUBLIC

04:47:54.423 --> 04:47:56.592
INPUT AND MAKING SURE THAT

04:47:56.659 --> 04:47:58.194
PEOPLE UNDERSTAND WHAT THE

04:47:58.260 --> 04:47:59.528
PROJECTS GOING TO LOOK LIKE THE

04:47:59.595 --> 04:48:02.765
MITIGATION IT'S THAT SHOULD BE --

04:48:02.832 --> 04:48:04.800
APPROPRIATE FOR THE PROJECT ALL

04:48:04.867 --> 04:48:06.636
OF THAT IS IS REALLY GOOD STUFF

04:48:06.702 --> 04:48:08.304
BUT THERE HAVE BEEN ABUSES OF

04:48:08.371 --> 04:48:10.106
THE SEA QUEST SYSTEM IN THE

04:48:10.172 --> 04:48:12.041
LITIGATION AND THE PART OF THE

04:48:12.108 --> 04:48:13.843
CHALLENGE WITH THE TESTIMONY

04:48:13.909 --> 04:48:14.610
THAT WAS PRESENTED AT THE

04:48:14.677 --> 04:48:15.378
HEARING.

04:48:15.444 --> 04:48:18.581
WAS IT QUITE FRANKLY THE THE THE

04:48:18.648 --> 04:48:20.683
STUDY WAS DONE YET THEY DID NOT

04:48:20.750 --> 04:48:22.685
INCLUDE ANY RURAL COMMUNITIES

04:48:22.752 --> 04:48:25.421
DID NOT INCLUDE -- COASTAL

04:48:25.488 --> 04:48:26.889
COMMUNITIES -- AND AND WAS

04:48:26.956 --> 04:48:29.792
REALLY REALLY VERY LIMITED AND

04:48:29.859 --> 04:48:32.328
SO IT THE CHECK THE CHALLENGE

04:48:32.395 --> 04:48:33.396
THAT WE HAVE WHEN WE START

04:48:33.462 --> 04:48:34.430
TALKING ABOUT SEEK WHAT.

04:48:34.497 --> 04:48:36.365
IS IT WE ALL COME WITH THEIR OWN

04:48:36.432 --> 04:48:36.899
EXPERIENCE ABOUT HOW HOUSE

04:48:36.966 --> 04:48:38.501
SPEAKER HAS BEEN USED IN OUR

04:48:38.567 --> 04:48:39.535
COMMUNITIES.

04:48:39.602 --> 04:48:44.173
AND THERE HAS NEVER BEEN.

04:48:44.240 --> 04:48:45.841
A SEE A PROJECT IN THE SALINAS

04:48:45.908 --> 04:48:46.776
VALLEY THAT HASN'T BEEN

04:48:46.842 --> 04:48:48.878
CHALLENGE FOR FARM WORKER

04:48:48.944 --> 04:48:51.747
HOUSING AND SO AND AND IT PART

04:48:51.814 --> 04:48:53.382
OF THE CHALLENGE IS THE THREAT

04:48:53.449 --> 04:48:55.051
OF SEQUEL LITIGATION.

04:48:55.117 --> 04:48:57.086
AND THE CHILLING EFFECT THAT IT

04:48:57.153 --> 04:48:59.922
HAS AND THE LENGTH OF TIME THAT

04:48:59.989 --> 04:49:01.590
THAT IS REQUIRED TO BE ABLE TO

04:49:01.657 --> 04:49:03.025
GO THROUGH THE A LITIGATION --

04:49:03.092 --> 04:49:05.094
PROCESS SO I I JUST WANT TO GET

04:49:05.161 --> 04:49:07.430
THAT I THINK PART OF WHY YOU SEE

04:49:07.496 --> 04:49:09.198
SOME LANGUAGE BEING WORKED ON IS

04:49:09.265 --> 04:49:12.068
BECAUSE IS THAT WE UNDERSTAND

04:49:12.134 --> 04:49:13.903
THERE ARE SOME OF US WHO FEEL --

04:49:13.969 --> 04:49:16.472
THAT THAT IT IS IMPORTANT TO

04:49:16.539 --> 04:49:18.407
GIVE THE JUDGE THE DISCRETION

04:49:18.474 --> 04:49:21.077
AND TO BE EXPLICIT ABOUT.

04:49:21.143 --> 04:49:22.478
THE DISCRETION TO BE ABLE TO SAY

04:49:22.545 --> 04:49:23.979
IF THIS IS A FRIVOLOUS LAWSUIT

04:49:24.046 --> 04:49:25.648
AND IT SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN FILED

04:49:25.715 --> 04:49:26.849
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

04:49:26.916 --> 04:49:29.919
THEN THERE'S THE ABILITY TO GIVE

04:49:29.985 --> 04:49:33.723
TO GIVE -- ATTORNEY'S FEES IN IN

04:49:33.789 --> 04:49:34.490
THE IN THE IN THE ANSWERS SO I I

04:49:34.557 --> 04:49:35.825
JUST WANT TO SAY THAT BECAUSE I

04:49:35.891 --> 04:49:37.059
JUST THINK THAT.

04:49:37.126 --> 04:49:38.227
THAT YOU DISCOUNT.

04:49:38.294 --> 04:49:40.362
SO MUCH THOSE OF US WHO HAVE HAD

04:49:40.429 --> 04:49:43.232
BAD EXPERIENCES THAT IT IT TO ME

04:49:43.299 --> 04:49:44.767
IT JUST SEEMS DISRESPECTFUL IT'S

04:49:44.834 --> 04:49:46.602
LIKE EVERYTHING YOU BELIEVE IN

04:49:46.669 --> 04:49:47.970
EVERYTHING YOU YOU KNOW.

04:49:48.037 --> 04:49:49.839
IS NOT TRUE AND SO WE'RE GOING

04:49:49.905 --> 04:49:50.840
TO MOVE ON AND DO SOMETHING THAT

04:49:50.906 --> 04:49:52.742
OBVIOUSLY I APPRECIATE THAT

04:49:52.808 --> 04:49:53.809
THAT'S NOT MY INTENT TOWARD MY

04:49:53.876 --> 04:49:55.878
SUGGESTION IS THAT WE ALREADY

04:49:55.945 --> 04:49:57.747
HAVE A CODE SECTION.

04:49:57.813 --> 04:49:59.982
THAT IS AVAILABLE IN THOSE CASES

04:50:00.049 --> 04:50:01.851
AND I CERTAINLY KNOW OF CASES

04:50:01.917 --> 04:50:05.054
WHERE I HAVE QUESTIONED THE

04:50:05.121 --> 04:50:07.857
MOTIVATION OF PEOPLE BRINGING OF

04:50:07.923 --> 04:50:10.025
OF THE SECT THESE KINDS OF

04:50:10.092 --> 04:50:10.793
LAWSUITS.

04:50:10.860 --> 04:50:12.128
THE COURTS ALREADY HAVE THE

04:50:12.194 --> 04:50:13.996
AUTHORITY AND THAT'S THE POINT

04:50:14.063 --> 04:50:15.464
THAT WE GOING TO KEEP.

04:50:15.531 --> 04:50:16.098
WE'RE GONNA KEEP PUNCHING THEM

04:50:16.165 --> 04:50:18.033
ABOUT IT OR WE GONNA SAY YOU

04:50:18.100 --> 04:50:19.969
HAVE THE AUTHORITY UNDER ONE

04:50:20.035 --> 04:50:21.537
TWENTY EIGHT POINT FIVE TO GRANT

04:50:21.604 --> 04:50:23.105
SANCTIONS IT'S THEIR NO ONE'S

04:50:23.172 --> 04:50:25.274
TRYING TO TAKE THAT AWAY.

04:50:25.341 --> 04:50:27.710
AND OBVIOUSLY WE YOU KNOW WE WE

04:50:27.777 --> 04:50:29.879
CAN SEE THINGS DIFFERENTLY AND I

04:50:29.945 --> 04:50:32.014
APPRECIATE THAT BUT MY MY POINT

04:50:32.081 --> 04:50:34.150
IS THAT WE HAVE A MECHANISM TO

04:50:34.216 --> 04:50:35.251
ADDRESS THOSE KINDS OF

04:50:35.317 --> 04:50:36.519
SITUATIONS.

04:50:36.585 --> 04:50:38.287
AND I HAVE WORKED ON THE SEQUEL

04:50:38.354 --> 04:50:38.988
ISSUE.

04:50:39.054 --> 04:50:40.189
OF FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS IN

04:50:40.256 --> 04:50:42.525
ORDER TO EXPEDITE THE PROCESS

04:50:42.591 --> 04:50:44.693
BECAUSE I SURE CONCERNS IN THE

04:50:44.760 --> 04:50:46.061
BILL THE DELAYS THAT HAVE

04:50:46.128 --> 04:50:47.263
EXISTED.

04:50:47.329 --> 04:50:50.666
SO NO ONE SAYING SEEK WAS

04:50:50.733 --> 04:50:51.600
PERFECT.

04:50:51.667 --> 04:50:52.735
BUT THE QUESTION IS DO WE HAVE A

04:50:52.802 --> 04:50:55.237
PROCESS ARE WE HAVE WE BEEN ABLE.

04:50:55.304 --> 04:50:57.940
TO EXPEDITED -- WE HAVE DONE A

04:50:58.007 --> 04:50:59.542
NUMBER OF THINGS RECENTLY THAT

04:50:59.608 --> 04:51:01.177
THAT REQUIRE COURTS WHEN THE

04:51:01.243 --> 04:51:02.745
CASE IS TO GO TO COURT TO BE

04:51:02.812 --> 04:51:04.780
FAST TRACKED TO THE DETRIMENT OF

04:51:04.847 --> 04:51:06.549
OTHER ISSUES PUBLIC POLICY.

04:51:06.615 --> 04:51:08.117
DECISIONS WHICH I HAVEN'T

04:51:08.184 --> 04:51:09.819
NECESSARILY AGREED WITH -- AND

04:51:09.885 --> 04:51:12.922
CLEARLY WE DO WE NEED TO TAKE A

04:51:12.988 --> 04:51:15.524
GOOD HARD COLD LOOK AT HOW WE

04:51:15.591 --> 04:51:17.426
ARE GOING TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE

04:51:17.493 --> 04:51:20.229
ISSUES WE HAVE AND MY SUGGESTION

04:51:20.296 --> 04:51:20.396
IS.

04:51:20.462 --> 04:51:21.564
THAT SEEK WHAT.

04:51:21.630 --> 04:51:23.265
HAS THE REMEDIES WITHIN IT BY

04:51:23.332 --> 04:51:25.467
WAY OF ONE TWENTY EIGHT POINT

04:51:25.534 --> 04:51:26.135
FIVE TO DO WITH THE ISSUES THAT

04:51:26.202 --> 04:51:28.404
THIS AUTHOR HAS PRESENTED HERE

04:51:28.470 --> 04:51:29.371
TODAY.

04:51:29.438 --> 04:51:30.172
OBVIOUSLY WE'RE GOING TO

04:51:30.239 --> 04:51:33.742
DISAGREE -- AND WITH THAT -- US

04:51:33.809 --> 04:51:34.844
SENATOR UMBERG WE'RE GONNA LET

04:51:34.910 --> 04:51:36.579
YOU HAVE THE LAST WORD AND THEN

04:51:36.645 --> 04:51:38.080
WE'RE GOING TO LET THE SENATOR

04:51:38.147 --> 04:51:39.481
BORCHERS LOSE WELL THANK YOU

04:51:39.548 --> 04:51:41.650
MADAM CHAIR -- JUST TO EXPAND

04:51:41.717 --> 04:51:42.618
UPON APPOINTED CENTER I'LL MAKE

04:51:42.685 --> 04:51:44.086
I ACTUALLY THINK WE'RE RAISING

04:51:44.153 --> 04:51:46.288
THE BAR HERE BECAUSE NOT JUST

04:51:46.355 --> 04:51:47.156
BAD FATE THE COURT.

04:51:47.223 --> 04:51:50.192
SHE WILL NEED TO FIND THAT THE

04:51:50.259 --> 04:51:53.329
PARTY ACTED IN BAD FAITH IN.

04:51:53.395 --> 04:51:55.197
IT WAS FRIVOLOUS OR INTENDED TO

04:51:55.264 --> 04:51:56.932
CAUSE UNNECESSARY DELAY AND SO

04:51:56.999 --> 04:51:58.834
IT IT RATHER RATHER THAN

04:51:58.901 --> 04:52:00.302
LOWERING THE BAR I THINK WE'RE

04:52:00.369 --> 04:52:01.670
ACTUALLY REYES IT'S A TOUGH

04:52:01.737 --> 04:52:03.639
STANDARD A VERY TOUGH STANDARD

04:52:03.706 --> 04:52:05.374
TO MEET IN TERMS OF ANY CHILLING

04:52:05.441 --> 04:52:06.775
EFFECT NO ONE HERE WOULD ARGUE.

04:52:06.842 --> 04:52:08.911
NOT AS OPPONENTS READY WHAT ELSE

04:52:08.978 --> 04:52:10.045
THAT SOMEONE SHOULD BE ABLE TO

04:52:10.112 --> 04:52:11.547
FILE LIVER FRIVOLOUS LAWSUIT.

04:52:11.614 --> 04:52:13.015
NO ONE'S GOING TO ARGUE THAT AND

04:52:13.082 --> 04:52:14.483
SO TO THE EXTENT THAT.

04:52:14.550 --> 04:52:17.086
THIS ACTUALLY RAISES THE BAR IT

04:52:17.152 --> 04:52:18.520
IT.

04:52:18.587 --> 04:52:20.322
SORT OF ENCAPSULATES IT SUCH

04:52:20.389 --> 04:52:21.523
THAT THE COURT.

04:52:21.590 --> 04:52:22.591
KNOWS ABOUT IT.

04:52:22.658 --> 04:52:23.926

IS CLEARLY FOR FRIVOLOUS OR IN

04:52:27.897 --> 04:52:32.701
BAD FAITH CAN INVOKE THAT THAT

GET BETTER -- AND I DO BELIEVE

04:55:33.182 --> 04:55:34.917
IT HAS MERIT THERE ARE MATERIAL

04:55:34.983 --> 04:55:35.751

INTO THINKING THAT EVERYTHING IS

04:55:41.290 --> 04:55:43.092
CO PATHETIC.

04:55:43.158 --> 04:55:44.393
BECAUSE IT'S NOT.

04:55:44.460 --> 04:55:45.828
WE WOULD BE LIVING WITH A LIVING

04:55:45.894 --> 04:55:47.796

THE NEEDLE ON THESE THINGS -- I

04:56:00.476 --> 04:56:01.076
DON'T THINK THINGS ARE GOING TO

WAY EACH WOMAN PAYS AN AVERAGE.

04:58:37.633 --> 04:58:39.534

WITH THE GENDER TAX.

04:59:07.262 --> 04:59:09.097

JACKIE SPEAR WHEN SHE WAS A

04:59:17.706 --> 04:59:19.641
MEMBER OF THE LEGISLATURE --

04:59:19.708 --> 04:59:21.743
CALIFORNIA ALREADY HAS A GENDER

04:59:21.810 --> 04:59:24.313
TAX REPEAL LAW THAT APPLIES TO

BACK WHEN I WAS IN THE ASSEMBLY

04:59:28.083 --> 04:59:29.818
IN THE EARLY TWO THOUSANDS I

04:59:29.885 --> 04:59:31.420
FOLLOWED UP ON THAT LAW TO BE

04:59:31.486 --> 04:59:33.422
SURE THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO

04:59:33.488 --> 04:59:35.791
POST THE DIFFERENCES IN PRICING.

04:59:35.857 --> 04:59:38.026
BASED UPON THINGS LIKE WHEN YOU

04:59:38.093 --> 04:59:40.462
GO TO THE CLEANER.

04:59:40.529 --> 04:59:43.765
AND DO YOU HAVE TWO SHIRTS.

04:59:43.832 --> 04:59:45.567
ALL THE BOTH THE SAME ONE IS A

04:59:45.634 --> 04:59:47.936
AMEND SURE MUCH LARGER BECAUSE

04:59:48.003 --> 04:59:49.471
THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED TO ME I

04:59:49.538 --> 04:59:52.741
TOOK MY HUSBAND SHIRT IN BIG GUY.

04:59:52.808 --> 04:59:55.143
MY SHIRT LITTLE PERSON.

04:59:55.210 --> 04:59:56.111
SAME SHIRT.

04:59:56.178 --> 04:59:57.346
MIKE -- COSTS FOR ME WAS FOUR

04:59:57.412 --> 05:00:00.082
DOLLARS AND TWENTY FIVE CENTS A

05:00:00.148 --> 05:00:00.716
COST FOR HIM WAS A DOLLAR AND A

05:00:00.782 --> 05:00:01.483
QUARTER.

05:00:01.550 --> 05:00:03.485
AND THIS KIND OF THING CONTINUED

05:00:03.552 --> 05:00:05.053
WHETHER IT WAS HAIRDRESSERS

05:00:05.120 --> 05:00:07.622
GOING TO GET A PAIR OF PANTS

05:00:07.689 --> 05:00:10.058
SHORTENED -- YOU KNOW FIGURE

05:00:10.125 --> 05:00:11.893
SHORTENING A PAIR OF PANTS. FOR

05:00:11.960 --> 05:00:14.196
WOMEN AND COST MORE EVEN THOUGH

05:00:14.262 --> 05:00:15.931
THERE'S LESS MATERIAL TO GO BUY

05:00:15.997 --> 05:00:17.799
A PAIR OF JEANS IT.

05:00:17.866 --> 05:00:20.068
WAS AT LEAST TEN DOLLARS MORE

05:00:20.135 --> 05:00:22.304
FOR WOMEN SHEEN SWITCHER LESS

05:00:22.371 --> 05:00:25.273
FABRIC.

05:00:25.340 --> 05:00:26.174
SAME STYLE.

05:00:26.241 --> 05:00:27.142
SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT HAS

05:00:27.209 --> 05:00:29.444
BEEN OF CONCERN -- TO ME FOR

05:00:29.511 --> 05:00:31.446
QUITE SOME TIME.

05:00:31.513 --> 05:00:34.216
BUT WE NOW HAVE A LAW THAT SAYS

05:00:34.282 --> 05:00:35.183
YOU CAN'T.

05:00:35.250 --> 05:00:37.452
CHARGE MORE FOR SERVICES.

05:00:37.519 --> 05:00:38.820
BUT IT'S LESS CLEAR THE PRICE

05:00:38.887 --> 05:00:40.589
DISCRIMINATION BASED ON GENDER

05:00:40.655 --> 05:00:42.924
IS OUTLAWED WHEN IT COMES TO

05:00:42.991 --> 05:00:44.760
CONSUMER GOODS.

05:00:44.826 --> 05:00:45.394
AND THAT'S WHERE THIS BILL COMES

05:00:45.460 --> 05:00:47.028
IN.

05:00:47.095 --> 05:00:48.330

THIS IS A COMMON OCCURRENCE THIS

HAPPENS ALL THE TIME.

05:01:56.598 --> 05:01:57.365
THESE ARE JUST A FEW MAYOR OF

05:01:57.432 --> 05:01:59.134
MYRIAD EXAMPLES THAT HAVE BEEN

05:01:59.201 --> 05:02:01.269
FOUND AND I ENCOURAGE YOU TO

05:02:01.336 --> 05:02:03.438
WATCH THE DAILY SHOW SEGMENT ON

05:02:03.505 --> 05:02:04.840
GENDER TAX FOR MORE.

05:02:04.906 --> 05:02:06.942
DONE IN ITS SLIGHTLYEDGY BUT NO

05:02:07.008 --> 05:02:08.477
LESS HUMOROUS APPROACH TO THE

05:02:08.543 --> 05:02:11.580
FACT THAT WOMEN DO INDEED PAY

05:02:11.646 --> 05:02:12.681
MORE FOR PRODUCTS THURMOND.

05:02:12.747 --> 05:02:14.516
AND ADD THAT TO THE FACT THAT WE

05:02:14.583 --> 05:02:15.851
ARE PAID LESS.

05:02:15.917 --> 05:02:17.652
THIS CREATES A GENDER GAP THAT

05:02:17.719 --> 05:02:20.188
REALLY NEEDS TO BE FIXED IT'S

05:02:20.255 --> 05:02:23.091
REAL AND IT'S DISCRIMINATORY.

05:02:23.158 --> 05:02:24.459
I'VE HEARD PEOPLE SAY THE GENDER

05:02:24.526 --> 05:02:26.294
TAXES CHOSE TO RIP OFF WELL IT

05:02:26.361 --> 05:02:27.896
IS A RIPOFF BUT I SHOULD BE TO

05:02:27.963 --> 05:02:29.598
YOU THAT IT IS FAR MORE THAN

05:02:29.664 --> 05:02:30.966
JUST A RIPOFF.

05:02:31.032 --> 05:02:33.068
A RIPOFF THAT AFFECTS EVERYONE

05:02:33.134 --> 05:02:34.402
EQUALLY IS A RIP OFF.

05:02:34.469 --> 05:02:35.804
A RIP OFF THAT IMPACTS A

05:02:35.871 --> 05:02:37.806
PROTECTED CLASS MORE THAN IT

05:02:37.873 --> 05:02:39.241
DOES EVERYONE ELSE.

05:02:39.307 --> 05:02:41.877
THIS TEXTBOOK DISCRIMINATION.

05:02:41.943 --> 05:02:43.245
YOU MAY SAY WELL IF THEY'RE

05:02:43.311 --> 05:02:44.779
BASICALLY THE SAME PRODUCT WOMEN

05:02:44.846 --> 05:02:46.348
SHOULD JUST GO FIND THE MEN'S

05:02:46.414 --> 05:02:48.049
VERSION AT THE CHEAPER PRICE AND

05:02:48.116 --> 05:02:49.985
BUY IT. TO WHICH I MUST ASK EVEN

05:02:50.051 --> 05:02:51.786
ASSUMING THAT WE ALL KNEW WHERE

05:02:51.853 --> 05:02:53.922
TO LOOK FOR THE MEN'S VERSION.

05:02:53.989 --> 05:02:55.290
WHY SHOULD WE HAVE TO DO THAT?

05:02:55.357 --> 05:02:56.925
WHY SHOULD WE HAVE TO GO THAT

05:02:56.992 --> 05:02:58.860
EXTRA MILE TO TRACK DOWN THE

05:02:58.927 --> 05:03:00.228
EQUIVALENT PRODUCT?

05:03:00.295 --> 05:03:02.063
TRUE GENDER EQUITY DEMANDS

05:03:02.130 --> 05:03:03.498
BETTER THAN THAT.

05:03:03.565 --> 05:03:05.433
AND BEFORE THIRD TURNING THINGS

05:03:05.500 --> 05:03:06.935
OVER TO MY WITNESSES ARE WANT TO

05:03:07.002 --> 05:03:08.970
ADDRESS SOME OF THE CONCERNS

05:03:09.037 --> 05:03:09.604
THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED ABOUT THE

05:03:09.671 --> 05:03:11.740
BILL.

05:03:11.806 --> 05:03:13.375
AND I APPRECIATE THE DISCUSSION.

05:03:13.441 --> 05:03:15.076
I THINK THE TIME IS NOW WE HAVE

05:03:15.143 --> 05:03:17.112
TO CLOSE THAT GAP THERE MAY BE A

05:03:17.178 --> 05:03:18.680
NUMBER OF DIFFERENT THINGS THAT

05:03:18.747 --> 05:03:20.448
WE CAN DO IN TWEAKING THIS.

05:03:20.515 --> 05:03:21.983
THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED WHEN I

05:03:22.050 --> 05:03:24.286
WENT AFTER THE WHOLE QUESTION OF

05:03:24.352 --> 05:03:26.855
GENDER INEQUALITY IN IN FAIR PAY

05:03:26.922 --> 05:03:28.390
AND WE WORKED ON THIS ISSUE WITH

05:03:28.456 --> 05:03:34.529
THE OPPOSITION TO NOT DISAGREE --

05:03:34.596 --> 05:03:36.831
END AND IT CAME TO A CONSENSUS

05:03:36.898 --> 05:03:39.301
WHICH IS NOW BEEN FOLLOWED BY

05:03:39.367 --> 05:03:39.868
FORTY ONE OTHER STATES USING

05:03:39.935 --> 05:03:42.203
THAT MODEL IN ORDER TO GET FAIR

05:03:42.270 --> 05:03:43.405
PAYIN THEIR STATES.

05:03:43.471 --> 05:03:44.806
FIRST THE OPPONENTS SAY THAT

05:03:44.873 --> 05:03:46.841
MANY THINGS GOING TO WHAT IS --

05:03:46.908 --> 05:03:48.310
WHAT DETERMINES THE PRICE?

05:03:48.376 --> 05:03:49.544
PRICE COULD DIFFER BETWEEN A

05:03:49.611 --> 05:03:51.112
MALE VERSION OF A PRODUCT IN A

05:03:51.179 --> 05:03:52.814
FEMALE VERSION OF A PRODUCT FOR

05:03:52.881 --> 05:03:54.482
ALL KINDS OF REASONS.

05:03:54.549 --> 05:03:55.850
MANY OF WHICH HAVE NOTHING TO DO

05:03:55.917 --> 05:03:57.018
WITH GENDER.

05:03:57.085 --> 05:03:58.186
FAIR ENOUGH BUT THE BILL

05:03:58.253 --> 05:04:00.689
ACCOUNTS FOR THIS.

05:04:00.755 --> 05:04:02.090
THE BILL PROHIBITS DIFFERENTIAL

05:04:02.157 --> 05:04:03.992
PRICING BASED ON GENDER.

05:04:04.059 --> 05:04:05.594
ONLY.%

05:04:05.660 --> 05:04:08.363
IT WOULD NOT PROHIBIT BUSINESSES.

05:04:08.430 --> 05:04:10.732
FROM SETTING PRICES FOR ANY BONA

05:04:10.799 --> 05:04:12.601
FIDE REASON OTHER THAN GENDER.

05:04:12.667 --> 05:04:14.202
FOLLOWING THE TRACK THE WE TOOK

05:04:14.269 --> 05:04:15.570
WITH EQUAL PAY.

05:04:15.637 --> 05:04:17.472
IF YOU HAVE A LEGITIMATE REASON

05:04:17.539 --> 05:04:18.640
TO PAY SOMEBODY DIFFERENTLY

05:04:18.707 --> 05:04:20.075
THAT'S A BONA FIDE FACTOR THAT

05:04:20.141 --> 05:04:22.577
HAS NO GENDER BASIS YOU CAN DO

05:04:22.644 --> 05:04:24.012
THAT THE SAME THING HERE.

05:04:24.079 --> 05:04:25.513
IF YOU CAN SHOW THAT THE REASON

05:04:25.580 --> 05:04:27.182
THAT YOU'RE CHARGING MORE IS NOT

05:04:27.248 --> 05:04:29.551
GENDER BASED YOU CAN DO THAT SO

05:04:29.618 --> 05:04:31.386
TO EMPHASIZE THAT POINT I'M

05:04:31.453 --> 05:04:32.954
OFFERING AN AMENDMENT TODAY.

05:04:33.021 --> 05:04:35.724
THAT STATES THAT MUCH EXPLICITLY --

05:04:35.790 --> 05:04:37.425
BUSINESSES DON'T HAVE TO WORRY

05:04:37.492 --> 05:04:39.127
ABOUT THE PRICE THEY SAID AS

05:04:39.194 --> 05:04:40.362
LONG AS THEY DON'T SEVEN BASED

05:04:40.428 --> 05:04:41.529
ON GENDER.

05:04:41.596 --> 05:04:43.298
SECOND THE OPPONENTS HAVE ARGUED

05:04:43.365 --> 05:04:44.399
THAT IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO

05:04:44.466 --> 05:04:45.934
ASSOCIATE A PRODUCT WITH THE

05:04:46.001 --> 05:04:48.069
GENDER WITHOUT.

05:04:48.136 --> 05:04:49.404
WITHOUT RESORTING THE GENDER

05:04:49.471 --> 05:04:51.439
STEREOTYPES THAT THIS CRITICISM

05:04:51.506 --> 05:04:53.108
I FIND A BIT RICH WHEN YOU

05:04:53.174 --> 05:04:54.643
CONSIDER HOW HEAVILY MANY

05:04:54.709 --> 05:04:57.045
BUSINESSES RELY ON STEREOTYPES

05:04:57.112 --> 05:04:58.079
FOR MARKETING.

05:04:58.146 --> 05:05:00.515
I THINK OF THINGS LIKE SELLING A

05:05:00.582 --> 05:05:02.183
CARL'S JUNIOR BURGER.

05:05:02.250 --> 05:05:04.019
THOSE BIG WHOPPER BURGERS HAVING

05:05:04.085 --> 05:05:07.389
WOMEN HALF UNDRESSED DROOLING

05:05:07.455 --> 05:05:08.790
OVER A BURGER.

05:05:08.857 --> 05:05:10.592
BECAUSE YOU WERE NOT EXACTLY

05:05:10.659 --> 05:05:12.293
TRYING TO APPEAL TO WOMEN WHO

05:05:12.360 --> 05:05:13.595
ARE GOING TO EAT FIVE POUNDS OF

05:05:13.662 --> 05:05:15.897
BEEF ANYWAY BUT THIS IS THE KIND

05:05:15.964 --> 05:05:17.699
OF THING WHERE YOU HAVE.

05:05:17.766 --> 05:05:20.468
OBVIOUSLY YOU HAVE AN ATTEMPT TO

05:05:20.535 --> 05:05:22.437
USE THOSE GENDER STEREOTYPES IN

05:05:22.504 --> 05:05:23.705
YOUR MARKETING.

05:05:23.772 --> 05:05:25.240
BUT I DON'T THINK THIS IS AS BIG

05:05:25.306 --> 05:05:27.042
A PROBLEM AS OPPONENTS WOULD

05:05:27.108 --> 05:05:28.510
HAVE YOU TO BELIEVE MANY

05:05:28.576 --> 05:05:29.944
PRODUCTS ARE CLEARLY LABELED ARE

05:05:30.011 --> 05:05:32.013
ADVERTISED AS FOR MEN OR FOR

05:05:32.080 --> 05:05:32.580
WOMEN.

05:05:32.647 --> 05:05:34.582
MANY PRODUCTS ARE CLEARLY PLACED

05:05:34.649 --> 05:05:37.118
IN A MAN'S DEPARTMENT OR WOMEN'S

05:05:37.185 --> 05:05:37.619
DEPARTMENT.

05:05:37.686 --> 05:05:38.920
WAS SO SHE SAID IN A PRODUCT

05:05:38.987 --> 05:05:40.955
WITH THE GENDER IN THOSE CASES

05:05:41.022 --> 05:05:42.257
IS CLEARLY A STRAIGHTFORWARD

05:05:42.323 --> 05:05:43.558
ASSOCIATION.

05:05:43.625 --> 05:05:44.926
AND IN THOSE CASES WHERE THE

05:05:44.993 --> 05:05:46.695
INDISCHE ARE MORE SUBTLE AND

05:05:46.761 --> 05:05:48.363
RELY ON HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION

05:05:48.430 --> 05:05:50.632
WITH GENDER THINGS LIKE COLOR

05:05:50.699 --> 05:05:52.634
THE WALKER SANTA FOR INSTANCE.

05:05:52.701 --> 05:05:54.302
THE BILL TRUST THE FACT FINDERS

05:05:54.369 --> 05:05:56.271
TO USE OUR COMMON SENSE AS WE

05:05:56.337 --> 05:05:58.073
OFTEN DO IN THE LAW. TO MAKE

05:05:58.139 --> 05:06:00.041
THIS DETERMINATION I THINK WE

05:06:00.108 --> 05:06:01.676
ALL KNOW THAT THE PINK SCOOTER

05:06:01.743 --> 05:06:03.478
WITH THE PICTURE THE PONY ON IT

05:06:03.545 --> 05:06:05.146
IS BEING PARKING A PRIMARILY TO

05:06:05.213 --> 05:06:06.047
GIRLS.

05:06:06.114 --> 05:06:07.782
EVEN IF IT DOESN'T SAY SO RIGHT

05:06:07.849 --> 05:06:09.851
ON THE LABEL AND THAT'S SAID BY

05:06:09.918 --> 05:06:11.319
THE WAY THAT PINK SCOOTER.

05:06:11.386 --> 05:06:14.622
COSTS TEN DOLLARS MORE THAN THE

05:06:14.689 --> 05:06:16.024
BLUE SCOOTER.

05:06:16.091 --> 05:06:18.693
AND AGAIN BASED ON A

05:06:18.760 --> 05:06:20.028
DIFFERENTIAL.

05:06:20.095 --> 05:06:21.763
SET BY GENDER SO THAT SAID IF

05:06:21.830 --> 05:06:23.231
MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE BELIEVE

05:06:23.298 --> 05:06:24.632
THAT THE BILL COULD BE IMPROVED

05:06:24.699 --> 05:06:26.468
BY IMPROVING FURTHER GUIDANCE ON

05:06:26.534 --> 05:06:28.103
HOW TO IDENTIFY GENDER FOR WHICH

05:06:28.169 --> 05:06:29.671
A PRODUCT IS INTENDED AND

05:06:29.738 --> 05:06:30.605
MARKETED.

05:06:30.672 --> 05:06:32.674
AND THAT'S CONVERSATION ARE MORE

05:06:32.741 --> 05:06:34.476
THAN WELCOME TO HAVE.

05:06:34.542 --> 05:06:36.177
FINALLY.

05:06:36.244 --> 05:06:36.978
ARE GONE FINALLY THE OPPONENTS

05:06:37.045 --> 05:06:38.246

BUSINESSES CAUGHT SETTING PRICES

05:06:54.763 --> 05:06:55.730
IN FACT.

05:06:55.797 --> 05:06:57.732
THIS IS EXACTLY THE SAME SET OF

05:06:57.799 --> 05:07:00.435

NOT BEING EXPOSED TO ANY FORM OF

05:07:12.914 --> 05:07:14.382
LIABILITY THAT ISN'T ALREADY OUT

05:07:14.449 --> 05:07:15.350
THERE.

05:07:15.416 --> 05:07:16.351
THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS THAT

PRETTY EASY.

05:11:47.688 --> 05:11:49.557
WHEN A RETAILER HAS THE SAME

THAT BILL BUT THIS BILL.

05:13:24.118 --> 05:13:25.486
IS DEFINITELY DIFFERENT -- AND

05:13:25.553 --> 05:13:27.688
IT'S NOT THE SAME SCENARIO AND I

05:13:27.755 --> 05:13:28.556
THINK IT WOULD BE A VERY

05:13:28.623 --> 05:13:30.858
DIFFERENT ISSUE IF MY TEN YEAR

05:13:30.925 --> 05:13:32.727
OLD DAUGHTER AND MY THIRTEEN

05:13:32.793 --> 05:13:33.528
YEAR OLD SON WENT UP TO THE

05:13:33.594 --> 05:13:35.129
REGISTER AND AT THE POINT OF

05:13:35.196 --> 05:13:35.730
SALE.

05:13:35.796 --> 05:13:37.565
WHEN THEY WERE BOTH WITH A BLUE

05:13:37.632 --> 05:13:39.400
RACER AND HANDS MY THIRTEEN YEAR

05:13:39.467 --> 05:13:41.135
OLD SON WAS CHARGED A LOWER

05:13:41.202 --> 05:13:42.837
PRICE THE MY TEN YEAR OLD

05:13:42.904 --> 05:13:43.604
DAUGHTER SIMPLY BECAUSE OF

05:13:43.671 --> 05:13:44.572
GENDER?

05:13:44.639 --> 05:13:45.540
BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE

05:13:45.606 --> 05:13:46.641
DEALING WITH HERE WE'RE DEALING

05:13:46.707 --> 05:13:49.544
WITH -- AT PRICE DIFFERENCE --

05:13:49.610 --> 05:13:51.212
BASED UPON TWO PRODUCTS WHICH

05:13:51.279 --> 05:13:52.813
THE CONSUMER CAN CHOOSE WHICH

05:13:52.880 --> 05:13:54.782
PRODUCT THEY CHOOSE AND IT'S NOT

05:13:54.849 --> 05:13:56.083
AT THE POINT OF SALE IN WHICH

05:13:56.150 --> 05:13:58.419
SOMEBODY IS GETTING CHARGED A

05:13:58.486 --> 05:13:59.086
DIFFERENT PRICE BECAUSE OF THEIR

05:13:59.153 --> 05:13:59.620
GENDER.

05:13:59.687 --> 05:14:00.888
SO IT'S NOT THE SAME WITH

05:14:00.955 --> 05:14:02.456
REGARDS TO THE DISCRIMINATION

05:14:02.523 --> 05:14:03.591
THAT THE UNDER CIVIL RIGHTS ACT

05:14:03.658 --> 05:14:05.426
GENERALLY TRIES TO COVER IT'S

05:14:05.493 --> 05:14:07.161
NOT THE SAME AS SERVICES WHEN

05:14:07.228 --> 05:14:08.396
THE SAME EXACT SERVICES BEING

05:14:08.462 --> 05:14:09.397
PROVIDED.

05:14:09.463 --> 05:14:10.798
BUT AT A DIFFERENT PRICE BECAUSE

05:14:10.865 --> 05:14:13.634
OF GENDER THIS IS TWO PRODUCTS

05:14:13.701 --> 05:14:14.936
THAT WERE HAVING TO ASSOCIATE

05:14:15.002 --> 05:14:17.405
THE GENDER WITH AND AGAIN IT'S

05:14:17.471 --> 05:14:18.806
TWO PRODUCTS OF THE CONSUMER HAS

05:14:18.873 --> 05:14:20.942
A CHOICE WITH REGARDS TO WHICH

05:14:21.008 --> 05:14:22.810
ONE TO BUY -- I WANT TO

05:14:22.877 --> 05:14:24.178
HIGHLIGHT THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF

05:14:24.245 --> 05:14:25.680
ACTION THAT IS ASSOCIATED WITH

05:14:25.746 --> 05:14:27.448
THIS BILL.

05:14:27.515 --> 05:14:29.083
YES IT IS AN EXISTING STATUTE --

05:14:29.150 --> 05:14:31.385
IT PROVIDES A MINIMUM FOUR

05:14:31.452 --> 05:14:32.620
THOUSAND DOLLAR PENALTY OR

05:14:32.687 --> 05:14:34.522

ACTUAL VIOLATION IS AND NO

05:14:36.257 --> 05:14:37.625
MATTER WHAT THE ACTUAL PRICE

05:14:37.692 --> 05:14:39.060
DIFFERENTIAL IS.

05:14:39.126 --> 05:14:40.695
AND SO WE'VE SEEN THIS BECAUSE

05:14:40.761 --> 05:14:41.862
IT'S THE SAME ENFORCEMENT

05:14:41.929 --> 05:14:43.831
STATUTE WITH REGARDS TO EIGHTY

05:14:43.898 --> 05:14:45.499
LITIGATION WE'VE SEEN THIS

05:14:45.566 --> 05:14:46.367
BECAUSE IT'S THE SAME

05:14:46.434 --> 05:14:47.668
ENFORCEMENT STATUTE THAT WE'VE

05:14:47.735 --> 05:14:49.170

TAX REPEAL ACT FOR SERVICES AND

05:14:51.005 --> 05:14:52.039
WHAT WE'VE SEEN.

05:14:52.106 --> 05:14:53.574
IS THERE IS AN INCENTIVE BECAUSE

05:14:53.641 --> 05:14:55.643
OF THAT MINIMUM FOUR THOUSAND

05:14:55.710 --> 05:14:57.411
DOLLARS IN STATUTORY DAMAGES TO

VIOLATION TO THE COMPANY.

05:15:10.758 --> 05:15:12.493
AND I KNOW THAT THE COMPANY IS

05:15:12.560 --> 05:15:13.694
GOING TO MAKE A CAP A COST

05:15:13.761 --> 05:15:15.129

05:15:18.466 --> 05:15:19.767
WHETHER OR NOT.

05:15:19.834 --> 05:15:21.435
IT'S WORTH IT TO GO AND FIGHT IN

05:15:21.502 --> 05:15:23.371
COURT WHICH WILL COST THEM OVER

05:15:23.437 --> 05:15:24.805
A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS TO

WHY THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS.

05:15:33.981 --> 05:15:35.283
ACTUALLY DON'T ADDRESS OUR ISSUE

05:15:35.349 --> 05:15:36.384
AND WHEN THEY'RE EVALUATING

05:15:36.450 --> 05:15:37.251

IN THE STATUTE.

05:15:46.260 --> 05:15:47.528

A AND I CAN'T THINK OF AN

05:18:58.919 --> 05:19:00.754
EXAMPLE WITH A CAR WHERE WE'RE

THE MOTRIN THAT MENTIONS

05:19:57.378 --> 05:19:59.046

YOU KNOW I I I STILL CONTINUE TO

05:21:31.372 --> 05:21:33.040
SAY TO MYSELF.

05:21:33.107 --> 05:21:35.109
IF IF IF THERE'S COMPANIES OUT

05:21:35.175 --> 05:21:36.377
THERE THAT CHARGE MORE FOR THE

05:21:36.443 --> 05:21:37.811

WHY ISN'T THERE.

05:21:38.879 --> 05:21:39.847

05:21:43.183 --> 05:21:44.785
A PIC MARKET AT THE SAME PRICES

05:21:44.852 --> 05:21:46.053
THE BLUE AS SORT OF A PINK RAZOR

05:21:46.120 --> 05:21:47.855
THIS IS AS AS THE SAME PRICE AS

05:21:47.921 --> 05:21:49.456
THE BLUE RYES OR AND AND I'M.

05:21:49.523 --> 05:21:51.358
I'M NOT REALLY UNDERSTANDING WHY.

05:21:51.425 --> 05:21:53.994
DO WHY WHY THERE'S NOT WHAT WHY

05:21:54.061 --> 05:21:57.431
THAT'S NOT -- PROVIDING

05:21:57.498 --> 05:21:57.731
[inaudible]

05:21:57.798 --> 05:21:59.299

SUBMIT TO YOU THAT IF WE MAKE

05:22:10.044 --> 05:22:12.413
THAT IT IF WE PROHIBIT GENDER

05:22:12.479 --> 05:22:14.648

05:22:14.715 --> 05:22:15.983
SELL THEM FOR THE SAME.

05:22:16.050 --> 05:22:17.484
BUT THE QUESTION COMES WHY

05:22:17.551 --> 05:22:19.887
SHOULD WHY SHOULD A WOMAN HAVE

05:22:19.953 --> 05:22:22.723

AND WE FOUND SOME OF THE WOMEN'S

05:22:38.238 --> 05:22:40.174
ISSUES WOMEN'S ITEMS TO DON

05:22:40.240 --> 05:22:42.609
DISCOUNT -- ON ON SOME IS THAT

05:22:42.676 --> 05:22:43.777
MUCH LOWER THE PRICE OF THE

05:22:43.844 --> 05:22:44.578
YOU'RE QUOTING.

05:22:44.645 --> 05:22:46.447
AND THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE TO DO

05:22:46.513 --> 05:22:47.347
WHEN YOU'RE SHOPPING YOU WILL.

05:22:47.414 --> 05:22:50.084
AND YOU SEE THAT'S FINE IF IT'S

05:22:50.150 --> 05:22:52.619
A NON GENDER BASED -- THE

05:22:52.686 --> 05:22:54.655
DECISION THEN YOU WILL YOU'RE

05:22:54.722 --> 05:22:56.690

DISCOUNT SOMETHING AND YOU CAN

05:22:58.726 --> 05:23:00.494
SHOW LOOK I'M DISCOUNTING THIS

05:23:00.561 --> 05:23:02.296
BECAUSE I GOT FIVE THOUSAND OPEN --

05:23:02.362 --> 05:23:04.331
AND I WANT TO CLEAR MY INVENTORY

05:23:04.398 --> 05:23:05.933
THAT'S A PERFECTLY LEGITIMATE

05:23:05.999 --> 05:23:06.800
REASON.

05:23:06.867 --> 05:23:08.969
IT'S THAT IF YOU HAVE TWO BANDS

05:23:09.036 --> 05:23:09.970
AND YOU WANT TO CLEAR YOUR

05:23:10.037 --> 05:23:11.605
INVENTORY YOU'RE STILL CHARGING

05:23:11.672 --> 05:23:13.640
MORE FOR THE FEMALE VERSION

05:23:13.707 --> 05:23:15.175
THAT'S DISCRIMINATION AND THAT'S

05:23:15.242 --> 05:23:16.310
WHAT THIS.

05:23:16.376 --> 05:23:18.779
BILL IS DESIGNED TO DO AND IF WE

05:23:18.846 --> 05:23:21.448
WERE GOING TO IF YOU IF YOU WILL

05:23:21.515 --> 05:23:23.650
HAVE TRADE CHANGE THAT WE WOULD

05:23:23.717 --> 05:23:24.451
HAVE ALREADY IT WOULD HAVE

05:23:24.518 --> 05:23:25.419
ALREADY HAPPENED.

05:23:25.486 --> 05:23:28.021
THIS PROBLEM IS ENDEMIC THIS

05:23:28.088 --> 05:23:30.591
PROBLEM HAS NOT RESOLVED AND I

05:23:30.657 --> 05:23:32.493
THINK WHAT'S CLEARLY IMPORTANT

05:23:32.559 --> 05:23:35.195
IS THAT IT HAS A NEGATIVE IMPACT

05:23:35.262 --> 05:23:37.131
ON WOMEN AND I THINK TOO I THINK

05:23:37.197 --> 05:23:38.866
THAT GOOD EXAMPLE YOU GOUP TO

05:23:38.932 --> 05:23:42.936
THE TO THE COUNTER -- I GET MY

05:23:43.003 --> 05:23:44.371
GRANDDAUGHTER A LITTLE HAVE.

05:23:44.438 --> 05:23:46.807
A HELMET -- FOR FOR BIKE AND

05:23:46.874 --> 05:23:49.910
IT'S PINK AND IT'S THIRTY NINE

05:23:49.977 --> 05:23:50.444
NINETY FIVE IN MY LITTLE

05:23:50.511 --> 05:23:58.919
GRANDSON ONCE A BLUE ONE AND HIS.

05:23:58.986 --> 05:23:59.486
TWENTY NINE NINETY FIVE AND

05:23:59.553 --> 05:24:00.120
THAT'S AND THAT IS A FACT THAT

05:24:00.187 --> 05:24:01.021
IS GENDER BASED PRICING IN THAT

05:24:01.088 --> 05:24:01.622
SHOULD BE UNLAWFUL AND THAT'S

05:24:01.688 --> 05:24:02.723
WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE --

05:24:02.790 --> 05:24:06.093
WE CAN -- WE CAN TALK ALL WE

05:24:06.160 --> 05:24:09.496
WANT -- BUT IT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE

05:24:09.563 --> 05:24:11.031
TO STAND PAT ON THIS AND ALLOW

05:24:11.098 --> 05:24:12.533
THAT DISCRIMINATION TO CONTINUE

05:24:12.599 --> 05:24:14.134
I MENTIONED EARLY ON THAT I'D

05:24:14.201 --> 05:24:15.636
BEEN WORKING ON THIS ISSUE FOR

05:24:15.702 --> 05:24:18.672
TWENTY YEARS -- AND WE STILL

05:24:18.739 --> 05:24:19.773
HAVEN'T MADE THOSE STRIDES

05:24:19.840 --> 05:24:21.608
BECAUSE COMPANIES DO IT BECAUSE

05:24:21.675 --> 05:24:22.976
THEY CAN GET AWAY WITH IT.

05:24:23.043 --> 05:24:25.078
WOMEN DO PAY MORE SHOULD WOMEN

05:24:25.145 --> 05:24:27.080
HAVE TO THEN TAKE THAT NEXT STEP

05:24:27.147 --> 05:24:28.482
THEY GO TO THE THEY GO TO THE

05:24:28.549 --> 05:24:30.150
STORE THEY GO INTO THE WOMEN'S

05:24:30.217 --> 05:24:31.752
SECTION OF A GAP.

05:24:31.819 --> 05:24:33.120
BECAUSE I WANT TO BUY CLOTHES

05:24:33.187 --> 05:24:34.121
THAT FIT THEM SO THEY'RE GOING

05:24:34.188 --> 05:24:36.190
TO THE WOMEN'S SECTION AND THERE

05:24:36.256 --> 05:24:38.759
ARE THEIR CHARGE MORE THAN IF

05:24:38.826 --> 05:24:40.060
THEY WENT INTO THE MEN'S SECTION.

05:24:40.127 --> 05:24:41.562
SO WHAT WE GONNA SAY WELL WOMEN

05:24:41.628 --> 05:24:43.230
IF YOU WANT TO PAY WHAT MEN PAY

05:24:43.297 --> 05:24:44.665
YOU HAVE TO GO INTO THE MEN'S

05:24:44.731 --> 05:24:46.133
SECTION WHY IS.

05:24:46.200 --> 05:24:47.935
TO EXPLAIN THAT TO THE THIRTEEN

05:24:48.001 --> 05:24:50.237
YEAR OLD LITTLE GIRL IT THAT

05:24:50.304 --> 05:24:51.872
THERE'S THERE IT IS

05:24:51.939 --> 05:24:53.574
DISCRIMINATION IT SHOULD BE

05:24:53.640 --> 05:24:56.176
UNLAWFUL AND IF WE DO NOTHING

05:24:56.243 --> 05:24:57.845
THE ANNUAL COST TO CALIFORNIA

05:24:57.911 --> 05:24:58.846
WOMEN.

05:24:58.912 --> 05:25:00.914
WHO HAVE TO PAY MORE IS THE TUNE

05:25:00.981 --> 05:25:02.749
OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS A YEAR IN

05:25:02.816 --> 05:25:04.852
CALIFORNIA THE WOMEN PAY MORE

05:25:04.918 --> 05:25:06.286
BECAUSE THERE SIMPLY BECAUSE

05:25:06.353 --> 05:25:07.588
SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY'RE WOMEN?

05:25:07.654 --> 05:25:09.223
THAT'S DISCRIMINATION THAT'S

05:25:09.289 --> 05:25:10.958
WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO WITH THE

05:25:11.024 --> 05:25:12.659
MARKET THE MARKET THE MARKET THE

05:25:12.726 --> 05:25:13.994

05:25:14.061 --> 05:25:15.729
CAN WHAT IT WILL BE ABLE TO BEAR.

05:25:15.796 --> 05:25:17.264
UNLESS WE SAY TO THE MARKET YOU

05:25:17.331 --> 05:25:18.098
KNOW MARKET.

05:25:18.165 --> 05:25:19.666
YOU CAN'T DISCRIMINATE ON THE

05:25:19.733 --> 05:25:21.368
BASIS OF GENDER WHEN YOU PRICE

05:25:21.435 --> 05:25:23.637
THESE THINGS IF YOU'VE GOT OTHER

05:25:23.704 --> 05:25:24.938
REASONS ABSOLUTELY.

05:25:25.005 --> 05:25:27.107
TOTALLY FAIR TOTALLY APPROPRIATE

05:25:27.174 --> 05:25:28.642
BUT IF YOU'RE DOING IT BECAUSE

05:25:28.709 --> 05:25:29.910

BEING CHARGED THE PRICE ISN'T

05:25:59.239 --> 05:26:00.574
BASED ON GENDER.

05:26:00.641 --> 05:26:02.476
IT MAY BE THAT THE SAME COMPANY

05:26:02.542 --> 05:26:04.144

THAT IS WHAT WE'RE GOING AFTER

05:26:09.783 --> 05:26:11.251
NOT THE DIFFERENCES.

05:26:11.318 --> 05:26:12.719
NOT THE DIFFERENTIALS IN PRICES

05:26:12.786 --> 05:26:14.321

WILL SELL IN THEIR COMMUNITY AND

05:28:12.039 --> 05:28:12.739
THEY'RE MAKING A DECISION BASED

05:28:12.806 --> 05:28:15.409
ON BASED ON THEIR KNOWLEDGE OF

05:28:15.475 --> 05:28:16.777

05:29:03.457 --> 05:29:04.891
BUT THEY THEY IT'S NOT A

05:29:04.958 --> 05:29:06.293
DECISION BASED ON I'M GOING TO

DISCRIMINATE AGAINST GIRLS.

05:29:08.962 --> 05:29:10.197
IT'S A DISCRIMINATE TO IT'S A

05:29:10.263 --> 05:29:12.365
DECISION BASED ON THE BEST

05:29:12.432 --> 05:29:13.700
WHAT'S IN THE BEST INTEREST OF

05:29:13.767 --> 05:29:15.902
THEIR PRODUCTS AND MOVING THINGS

05:29:15.969 --> 05:29:16.503
AND SELLING THINGS AND THEN

05:29:16.570 --> 05:29:18.371
THEY'RE NOT.

05:29:18.438 --> 05:29:18.972
THEN THEY'RE NOT VIOLATING THE

05:29:19.039 --> 05:29:19.539
LAW.

05:29:19.606 --> 05:29:21.441
BUT THE BUT THE POTENTIAL THE

05:29:21.508 --> 05:29:23.276
POTENTIAL FOR SOMEONE TO SHAKE

05:29:23.343 --> 05:29:24.411
HIM DOWN FOR THE FOURTH WE ARE

05:29:24.478 --> 05:29:25.212
YOU TELLING ME THAT SEE YOU'RE

05:29:25.278 --> 05:29:27.414
TALKING ABOUT THE SHAKEDOWN

05:29:27.481 --> 05:29:28.615
LAWSUITS WHICH ARE.

05:29:28.682 --> 05:29:31.485
REALLY OF FICTION WE DON'T SEE

05:29:31.551 --> 05:29:33.120
THE SHAKEDOWN LAWSUITS HAVE TO

05:29:33.186 --> 05:29:34.855
TELL YOU I'VE BEEN IN THIS WE

05:29:34.921 --> 05:29:37.224
SEE THE WORLD TOTALLY DIFFERENT --

05:29:37.290 --> 05:29:39.593
WELL I'D I'D BE VERY INTERESTED

05:29:39.659 --> 05:29:41.394
IN HOW MANY SHAKEDOWN LAWSUITS

05:29:41.461 --> 05:29:44.498
HAVE BEEN IN YOUR COMMUNITY --

05:29:44.564 --> 05:29:46.900
WE HAVE -- I I KNOW THERE.

05:29:46.967 --> 05:29:48.301
THERE WERE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE

05:29:48.368 --> 05:29:50.270
ADA YOU SHOULD WE NOW GIVE OF

05:29:50.337 --> 05:29:53.306
RIGHT TO CURE -- THERE THERE WAS

05:29:53.373 --> 05:29:55.175
ONE LAW FIRM I REMEMBER BACK IN

05:29:55.242 --> 05:29:57.544
THE OLD DAY AND THEY WE PUT THEM

05:29:57.611 --> 05:29:59.579
OUT OF BUSINESS OF ON THE BASIS

05:29:59.646 --> 05:30:01.414
OF EXTORTION BECAUSE TO SHAKE

05:30:01.481 --> 05:30:02.949
DOWN IS EXTORTION.

05:30:03.016 --> 05:30:05.018
AND IT'S A CRIME IT IS BUT THE

05:30:05.085 --> 05:30:06.853
PROBLEM IS IS IT HAPPENS ALL THE

05:30:06.920 --> 05:30:08.755
TIME AND IN THE EIGHTY EIGHT

05:30:08.822 --> 05:30:11.525
ROME IT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME.

05:30:11.591 --> 05:30:13.059
BUT IT SO YOU GO TO YOUR D. A.

05:30:13.126 --> 05:30:15.162
AND YOU SAY I'M BEING SHAKEN

05:30:15.228 --> 05:30:17.631
DOWN BY THIS FIRM YOU SEE. TO TO

05:30:17.697 --> 05:30:19.566
TO CONFLATE THE TWO MAIN SHOW

05:30:19.633 --> 05:30:20.767
WE'RE NEVER GOING TO BE ABLE TO

05:30:20.834 --> 05:30:22.202
MAKE PROGRESS WHEN IT COMES TO

05:30:22.269 --> 05:30:23.737
ADDRESSING PROBLEMS BECAUSE

05:30:23.803 --> 05:30:24.671
PEOPLE.

05:30:24.738 --> 05:30:26.173
BECAUSE PEOPLE SAY AND WE HEAR

05:30:26.239 --> 05:30:28.175
IS A FRIVOLOUS LAWSUIT WE HAVE

05:30:28.241 --> 05:30:31.178
WE HAVE FIRST FOR YOU NOT GOING

05:30:31.244 --> 05:30:33.380
TO BRING A LAWSUIT IT'S JUST

05:30:33.446 --> 05:30:34.481
FINISH BY SAYING.

05:30:34.548 --> 05:30:42.122
THAT THAT THAT THE MY CONCERN IT.

05:30:42.189 --> 05:30:43.056
I AS I SAID WHEN I STARTED

05:30:43.123 --> 05:30:43.723
INTELLECTUALLY I UNDERSTAND WHAT

05:30:43.790 --> 05:30:44.357
YOU'RE WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

05:30:44.424 --> 05:30:45.492
BUT THE NET EFFECT OF IT IS IT

05:30:45.559 --> 05:30:48.395
THE NUMBER OF GENDER BASED.

05:30:48.461 --> 05:30:51.398
DIFFERENTIAL PRICING IS IS VERY

05:30:51.464 --> 05:30:53.233
SMALL IN COMPARISON TO ALL THE

05:30:53.300 --> 05:30:55.735
PRODUCTS THAT PEOPLE PEOPLE BY.

05:30:55.802 --> 05:30:58.138
AND AND IT YES THERE ARE

05:30:58.205 --> 05:31:01.441
DIFFERENCES BUT I DON'T SEE THAT

05:31:01.508 --> 05:31:03.643
THOSE DEFENSES BECOME EASILY

05:31:03.710 --> 05:31:04.945
UNDERSTOOD.

05:31:05.011 --> 05:31:07.414
OR EASILY EIGHT EASY TO DEFEND

05:31:07.480 --> 05:31:08.782
YOURSELF AGANST BECAUSE THE

05:31:08.848 --> 05:31:10.450
BOTTOM LINE IS WHEN SOMEBODY

05:31:10.517 --> 05:31:11.651
SEND YOU A LETTER SAYING.

05:31:11.718 --> 05:31:12.919
WERE OMINOUS TO YOU ON THIS

05:31:12.986 --> 05:31:15.488
ISSUE PEOPLE PANIC AND THEY GO

05:31:15.555 --> 05:31:15.989
AND THEY SPEND MONEY ON

05:31:16.056 --> 05:31:17.991
ATTORNEYS AND THAT'S THE KIND OF

05:31:18.058 --> 05:31:19.392
THAT'S A KIND OF ACTION AND

05:31:19.459 --> 05:31:20.694
REACTION THAT I'M.

05:31:20.760 --> 05:31:22.229
THAT I'M JUST NOT IN INTERESTED

05:31:22.295 --> 05:31:23.363
IN PUTTING IN PUTTING ON THE

05:31:23.430 --> 05:31:25.265
BACKS OF YEAH I MEAN IT'S EASY

05:31:25.332 --> 05:31:26.600
WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT MOTRIN.

05:31:26.666 --> 05:31:28.201
I MEAN BECAUSE THEY'RE A BIG

05:31:28.268 --> 05:31:29.736
COMPANY AND FRANKLY I DO JUST

05:31:29.803 --> 05:31:31.571
THAT THINK THAT'S DECEPTIVE --

05:31:31.638 --> 05:31:33.206
PRACTICE A DECEPTIVE PRACTICE IN

05:31:33.273 --> 05:31:34.507
THE OUGHT TO BE SUED FOR IT BUT

05:31:34.574 --> 05:31:36.676
IT'S NOT.

05:31:36.743 --> 05:31:38.078
IT'S NOT NECESSARILY GENDER

05:31:38.144 --> 05:31:40.013
BASED AS MUCH AS IT IS THEY

05:31:40.080 --> 05:31:41.281
FIGURED OUT WHAT IT IS THAT'S

05:31:41.348 --> 05:31:43.149
GOING TO MOVE PEOPLE AND WHAT IT

05:31:43.216 --> 05:31:44.618
IS GENDER BASED.

05:31:44.684 --> 05:31:46.553
IT IS GENERATIONAL ME CHILL

05:31:46.620 --> 05:31:48.021
SUGGEST YOU THAT.

05:31:48.088 --> 05:31:51.024
WOMEN ON AVERAGE PAY AT LEAST

05:31:51.091 --> 05:31:53.827
THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR MORE FOR

05:31:53.893 --> 05:31:55.228
THEIR PRODUCTS.

05:31:55.295 --> 05:31:57.030
THEN THEN MEN DO SO YOU'RE

05:31:57.097 --> 05:31:58.698
TALKING ABOUT YOUR MALL YOU'RE

05:31:58.765 --> 05:32:01.501
YOU'RE LOW INCOME WORKERS WHO

05:32:01.568 --> 05:32:03.670
GOES INTO A STORE.

05:32:03.737 --> 05:32:05.805
MAKING MINIMUM WAGE OR AS A

05:32:05.872 --> 05:32:07.674

DOLLARS MORE ON AVERAGE A YEAR.

05:32:13.046 --> 05:32:15.415
FOR PRODUCTS BECAUSE COMPANIES

05:32:15.482 --> 05:32:18.351
FEEL AND ARE ABLE TO GET AWAY

05:32:18.418 --> 05:32:19.886
WITH CHARGING MORE BECAUSE

05:32:19.953 --> 05:32:20.787
THEY'RE WOMEN.

05:32:20.854 --> 05:32:23.023
IF YOU LOOK AT IT THAT WAY IT'S

05:32:23.089 --> 05:32:24.257
KIND OF HARD TO ARGUE.

05:32:24.324 --> 05:32:25.525
THE WHOLE ISSUE OF THESE

05:32:25.592 --> 05:32:27.327
FRIVOLOUS LAWSUITS TO SHAKE DOWN

05:32:27.394 --> 05:32:29.362
LAWSUIT WE THE END RESERVE A

05:32:29.429 --> 05:32:30.864

05:32:30.930 --> 05:32:32.165
SERVICES.

05:32:32.232 --> 05:32:33.900
BUT WE'RE NOT SEEING A PLETHORA

05:32:33.967 --> 05:32:36.870
OF LAWSUITS BASED UPON THIS THAT

05:32:36.936 --> 05:32:39.406
IS SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE --

05:32:39.472 --> 05:32:42.008
ANTICIPATE BUT HAVE NOT BEEN

05:32:42.075 --> 05:32:44.778
REALIZED AND WE THE END TO TO

05:32:44.844 --> 05:32:47.047
SAY THAT WE ARE GOING TO PROTECT.

05:32:47.113 --> 05:32:48.615
CIVIL RIGHTS ON THE END AND

05:32:48.682 --> 05:32:50.917
ALLOW FOR LITIGATION OF THE

05:32:50.984 --> 05:32:53.620
RIGHTEOUS VIOLATED GIVES PEOPLE

05:32:53.687 --> 05:32:54.387
REMEDY.

BUT IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT

05:32:55.922 --> 05:32:57.290
HAPPENS EVERY DAY OF THE WEEK

05:32:57.357 --> 05:32:58.658

THAT -- THAT WE ARE.

05:33:09.502 --> 05:33:12.339
NOT GOING TO A BY THIS KIND OF

05:33:12.405 --> 05:33:13.740
GENDER BASED PRICING.

05:33:13.807 --> 05:33:15.542

UNLAWFUL -- GIVE THEM THE

05:33:25.819 --> 05:33:28.121
OPPORTUNITY TO REEVALUATE TO IF

05:35:48.928 --> 05:35:49.996
YOU KNOW I THINK OUR DISTRICTS

05:35:50.063 --> 05:35:51.164
ARE SIMILAR IN SOME OF THESE

05:35:51.231 --> 05:35:52.932
RURAL AREAS.

05:35:52.999 --> 05:35:54.834
THIS GUY DID FALL AND IT DID

05:35:54.901 --> 05:35:55.902
CAUSE PROBLEMS FOR A LOT OF

05:35:55.969 --> 05:35:57.704
PEOPLE AND I APPRECIATE THAT BUT

05:35:57.770 --> 05:35:59.305
WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT THE ADA

05:35:59.372 --> 05:36:01.140
HERE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A LAW

05:36:01.207 --> 05:36:03.409
THE CHIP SIMPLY EXPANDS THE SAME.

05:36:03.476 --> 05:36:05.678
THE THE LOS THE LAWSUIT REMAINS

05:36:05.745 --> 05:36:07.180
THE SAME.

05:36:07.247 --> 05:36:08.848
AS SENATOR KIRBY -- POINTED OUT

05:36:08.915 --> 05:36:11.851
YOU'VE YOU'VE GOT SOMEBODY THAT

05:36:11.918 --> 05:36:12.552
UNDER NO.

05:36:12.619 --> 05:36:14.888
INTENT ILL INTENT.

05:36:14.954 --> 05:36:16.789
ACCORDING TO TO YOUR BILL.

05:36:16.856 --> 05:36:18.958
I MEAN THEY COULD AGREE WITH YOU

05:36:19.025 --> 05:36:19.759
ONE A PERSON ON THE ISSUE BUT

05:36:19.826 --> 05:36:20.326
THEY'VE.

05:36:20.393 --> 05:36:21.661
AS CENTER ALLEN POINTED OUT

05:36:21.728 --> 05:36:23.296
THEY'VE GOT TO FIND A WAY TO

05:36:23.363 --> 05:36:24.964
MOVE THESE PRODUCTS.

05:36:25.031 --> 05:36:27.467
AND THEY BECOME GUILTY UNDER THE

05:36:27.534 --> 05:36:28.701
SLAB UNDER THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF

05:36:28.768 --> 05:36:31.037
CURE OR PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION.

05:36:31.104 --> 05:36:33.039
AND YOU'RE NOT OFFERING A CURE

05:36:33.106 --> 05:36:35.808
SO THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION --

05:36:35.875 --> 05:36:37.310
I I THINK IS THE MAIN PROCESSOR

05:36:37.377 --> 05:36:39.112
MAIN PROBLEM FOR ME I UNDERSTAND

05:36:39.178 --> 05:36:40.446
THEY'RE NOT.

05:36:40.513 --> 05:36:42.482
THEY'RE NOT SUBJECT THEY'RE NOT

05:36:42.549 --> 05:36:44.918
SUBJECT TO ANY ACTION BECAUSE

05:36:44.984 --> 05:36:47.120
IT'S A NON GENDER BASED REASON

05:36:47.186 --> 05:36:47.987
THAT THEY'RE CHARGING A

05:36:48.054 --> 05:36:49.355
DIFFERENTIAL.

05:36:49.422 --> 05:36:51.124
AND WOOD AND AGAIN I'D LIKE TO

05:36:51.190 --> 05:36:53.059
JUST SUGGEST WE WE ALL GO BACK

05:36:53.126 --> 05:36:54.294
TO THE A. D. A. AND I THINK THAT

05:36:54.360 --> 05:36:55.295
WE'VE.

05:36:55.361 --> 05:36:57.063
TRIED TO ADDRESS THAT WE'RE NOT

05:36:57.130 --> 05:36:58.431
TALKING ABOUT THE ADA HERE WE'RE

05:36:58.498 --> 05:36:59.866
TALKING ABOUT PRICING WE'RE

05:36:59.933 --> 05:37:02.502
TALKING ABOUT PRICING WE NOW WE

05:37:02.569 --> 05:37:07.240
FEEL WE HAVE -- MADE UNLAWFUL.

05:37:07.307 --> 05:37:08.241
GENDER BASED PRICING ON SERVICES

05:37:08.308 --> 05:37:10.476
WE HAVE NOT SEEN THIS GUY FALL.

05:37:10.543 --> 05:37:12.245
WE ARE JUST SIMPLY ADDING TO

05:37:12.312 --> 05:37:16.683
THAT NO GENDER BASED BASIS --

05:37:16.749 --> 05:37:19.686
FOR PRODUCTS AND AS I SAID I I'M

05:37:19.752 --> 05:37:22.422
SYMPATHETIC TO PEOPLE BEING ABLE

05:37:22.488 --> 05:37:24.524
TO UNDER BEING ABLE TO BE GIVEN

05:37:24.591 --> 05:37:25.758
NOTICE OF THIS.

05:37:25.825 --> 05:37:27.860
I AND I AND I'M HAPPY TO WORK IN

05:37:27.927 --> 05:37:30.663
DEFERRING THE IMPLEMENTATION SO

05:37:30.730 --> 05:37:32.465
THE PEOPLE DO GET NOTICE.

05:37:32.532 --> 05:37:34.200
THIS ISN'T THE GOTCHA KIND OF

05:37:34.267 --> 05:37:36.202
SITUATION THIS IS JUST SIMPLY

05:37:36.269 --> 05:37:38.004
WHERE WE ARE TRYING. TO TO

05:37:38.071 --> 05:37:39.739
CORRECT AN INEQUITY THAT HAS

05:37:39.806 --> 05:37:42.442
EXISTED FOR FAR TOO LONG LONG

05:37:42.508 --> 05:37:44.310
AND COST WOMEN.

05:37:44.377 --> 05:37:44.911
THEY PAY MORE BECAUSE THEY'RE

05:37:44.978 --> 05:37:48.214
WOMEN THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ALL

05:37:48.281 --> 05:37:51.084
ABOUT.

05:37:51.150 --> 05:37:52.151
WHAT WILL THANK YOU -- BUT

05:37:52.218 --> 05:37:53.119
MANAGER I'VE BEEN HANDED THE

05:37:53.186 --> 05:37:55.355
GAVEL SO WE'RE ALL IN TROUBLE ON

05:37:55.421 --> 05:37:57.290
SO -- I I TOLD YOU EARLIER IVES

05:37:57.357 --> 05:37:57.924
IN SUPPORT THE BILL ME TO KEEP

05:37:57.991 --> 05:37:59.225
MY COMMITMENT BUT YOU HAVE A

05:37:59.292 --> 05:38:01.394
QUESTION QUESTION IS THAT WITH

05:38:01.461 --> 05:38:02.562
WITH RESPECT TO THE ISSUES BEEN

05:38:02.629 --> 05:38:04.130
REYES CONCERNING A D. A. I. GET

05:38:04.197 --> 05:38:05.264
THAT.

05:38:05.331 --> 05:38:07.500
ARM IN A RIGHT TO CURE -- WOULD

05:38:07.567 --> 05:38:09.302
WOULD YOU AT LEAST THINK ABOUT

05:38:09.369 --> 05:38:11.104
AS THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD A

05:38:11.170 --> 05:38:12.639
RIGHT TO CURE JUST AS EXISTED

05:38:12.705 --> 05:38:15.475
ADA SO FOR EXAMPLE WHERE THE

05:38:15.541 --> 05:38:18.878
SMALL BUSINESS OWNER -- MAY MAY

05:38:18.945 --> 05:38:21.047
OR MAY NOT BE USING GENDER BASED

05:38:21.114 --> 05:38:23.549
PRICING THAT THAT IS OFFENSIVE

05:38:23.616 --> 05:38:25.785
TO TO ALL OF US I THINK -- IF

05:38:25.852 --> 05:38:27.053
THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO CURE.

05:38:27.120 --> 05:38:29.122
BOB PERHAPS THEY FIX IT WITHOUT

05:38:29.188 --> 05:38:30.757
BEING ENGAGE IN LITIGATION SO MY

05:38:30.823 --> 05:38:32.425
QUESTION TO YOU IS WHETHER YOU

05:38:32.492 --> 05:38:33.793
WOULD AT LEAST ENTERTAIN THAT.

05:38:33.860 --> 05:38:35.128
IS THIS MOVES FORWARD CERTAINLY

05:38:35.194 --> 05:38:36.763
AS WE AS WE LOOK AT SMALL

05:38:36.829 --> 05:38:39.766
BUSINESSES WHO WHO ARE I THINK

05:38:39.832 --> 05:38:42.201
THE CONCERN THAT MOST OF US HAVE.

05:38:42.268 --> 05:38:43.803
A IT'S DIFFERENT THAN THE

05:38:43.870 --> 05:38:45.505
MANUFACTURER IT'S YOU SO I THINK

05:38:45.571 --> 05:38:47.273
IF WE WERE TO LOOK AT HOW WE

05:38:47.340 --> 05:38:49.842
MAKE SURE THAT SMALL BUSINESSES

05:38:49.909 --> 05:38:51.010
HAVE THE PROPER.

05:38:51.077 --> 05:38:53.212
NOTICE SO THAT THEY CAN TAKE THE

05:38:53.279 --> 05:38:55.548
IN THE NECESSARY ACTION I

05:38:55.615 --> 05:38:57.617
CERTAINLY WILLING TO CONSIDER

05:38:57.684 --> 05:38:58.851
THAT BECAUSE OF THIS.

05:38:58.918 --> 05:38:59.819
WE'RE NOT OUT THERE LOOKING AT

05:38:59.886 --> 05:39:01.154
THE MOM AND POP STORE WHAT WE

05:39:01.220 --> 05:39:06.359
WANT TO GET AT IS A CULTURE.

05:39:06.426 --> 05:39:07.694
OF DISCRIMINATION AND PRICING

05:39:07.760 --> 05:39:08.327
AND WE USUALLY SEE IT FROM THE

05:39:08.394 --> 05:39:09.028
BIG FOLKS OUT THERE NOT THE

05:39:09.095 --> 05:39:09.929
LITTLE PEOPLE AND NOBODY WANTS

05:39:09.996 --> 05:39:12.198
TO GO AFTER THE LITTLE GUY.

05:39:12.265 --> 05:39:12.832
A LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH

05:39:12.899 --> 05:39:13.433
YOU.

05:39:13.499 --> 05:39:14.901
HAPPY TO DO IT.

05:39:14.967 --> 05:39:17.270
OTHER OTHER QUESTIONS.

05:39:17.336 --> 05:39:19.105
IS CENTER FOR MONNING MOVES THE

05:39:19.172 --> 05:39:20.206
BILL.

05:39:20.273 --> 05:39:21.941
I'M SORRY GOOD I'M FOR MARKET

05:39:22.008 --> 05:39:22.842
CAN I GET YEAH I CAN GET MS

05:39:22.909 --> 05:39:26.112
BROWN TO COME BACK UP AND FROM

05:39:26.179 --> 05:39:29.716
THE OPPOSITION AND CAN YOU MAYBE

05:39:29.782 --> 05:39:31.184
JUST BREAK YEAH MAYBE JUST

05:39:31.250 --> 05:39:32.552
BRIEFLY.

05:39:32.618 --> 05:39:35.455
ADDRESS THE CONCERNS IT'S CENTER

05:39:35.521 --> 05:39:36.789
CABALLERO AND I HAVE.

05:39:36.856 --> 05:39:38.991
RAISED.

05:39:39.058 --> 05:39:41.127
OR YOU KNOW MAYBE HOW YOU WOULD

05:39:41.194 --> 05:39:43.129
SEE HAVE YOU CAN PAINT A BETTER

05:39:43.196 --> 05:39:45.665
PICTURE OF HOW OUR ANALOGY.

05:39:45.732 --> 05:39:48.101
WOULD BE A PROBLEM OF FOR THIS

05:39:48.167 --> 05:39:50.403
MR.

05:39:50.470 --> 05:39:52.438
YES THANK YOU -- WITH REGARDS TO

05:39:52.505 --> 05:39:53.973
THE LITIGATION I THINK THE

05:39:54.040 --> 05:39:55.708
REASON WHY THE EIGHTY A ISSUE

05:39:55.775 --> 05:39:57.844
KEEPS BEING RAISED IS BECAUSE IT

05:39:57.910 --> 05:40:00.113
IS THE EXACT SAME STATUTE THAT

05:40:00.179 --> 05:40:01.881
IS UTILIZED TO ENFORCE.

05:40:01.948 --> 05:40:03.049
THE ATA ISSUES IN THE

05:40:03.116 --> 05:40:03.983
CONSTRUCTION RELATED

05:40:04.050 --> 05:40:05.985
ACCESSIBILITY ISSUES AND WE HAVE

05:40:06.052 --> 05:40:07.954
SEEN MULTIPLE EXAMPLES I BELIEVE

05:40:08.020 --> 05:40:09.756
THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS TRIED

05:40:09.822 --> 05:40:12.158
EFFORTS WITH REGARDS TO REVISING

05:40:12.225 --> 05:40:14.026
THAT BUT THE MERE FACT.

05:40:14.093 --> 05:40:15.762
THAT YOU HAVE EASY.

05:40:15.828 --> 05:40:17.663
ACCESSIBILITY STANDARD ALLEGED

05:40:17.730 --> 05:40:19.799
VIOLATION OPENS YOU UP THE

05:40:19.866 --> 05:40:21.501
LITIGATION THAT YOU AND SENATOR

05:40:21.567 --> 05:40:23.636
CAFIERO RACE WHICH IS YOU GET

05:40:23.703 --> 05:40:24.771
THE DEMAND LETTER.

05:40:24.837 --> 05:40:26.239
AND A DEMAND LETTER SAYS YOU

05:40:26.305 --> 05:40:27.440
KNOW THERE'S THIS ALLEGED

05:40:27.507 --> 05:40:28.941
VIOLATION AND YOU'RE NOW SUBJECT

05:40:29.008 --> 05:40:30.243
TO DEALING WITH WHETHER OR NOT

05:40:30.309 --> 05:40:32.044
YOU PAY FOR A COST OF DEFENSE

05:40:32.111 --> 05:40:33.346
WAS YOURS EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE.

05:40:33.412 --> 05:40:35.047
OR YOU JUST PAY OUT THE MINIMUM

05:40:35.114 --> 05:40:37.016
STATUTORY DAMAGES WHICH IS FOUR

05:40:37.083 --> 05:40:38.284
THOUSAND AND I WILL SAY WITH THE

05:40:38.351 --> 05:40:39.952
GENDER SERVICES -- THE GENDER

05:40:40.019 --> 05:40:41.420
TAX REPEAL ACT WE HAVE SEEN

05:40:41.487 --> 05:40:43.456
EVIDENCE OF LITIGATION WE

05:40:43.523 --> 05:40:45.591
DECIDED TO SEVERAL OF THE CASES

05:40:45.658 --> 05:40:47.126
IN OUR LETTER.

05:40:47.193 --> 05:40:48.961
IN WHICH THE GENDER SERVICES TAX

05:40:49.028 --> 05:40:50.563
REPEAL ACTED THERE WAS LAWSUITS

05:40:50.630 --> 05:40:53.099
NOT BY WOMEN BECAUSE A SERVICE

05:40:53.166 --> 05:40:55.535
WAS PRICE DIFFERENTLY FOR THEM

05:40:55.601 --> 05:40:57.069
BUT ACTUALLY BY MEN.

05:40:57.136 --> 05:40:58.938
BECAUSE THE PRICE WAS HIGHER FOR

05:40:59.005 --> 05:41:00.773
THEM THAN IT WAS FOR THE WOMAN

05:41:00.840 --> 05:41:02.408
AND THIS BILL ALLOWS EITHER

05:41:02.475 --> 05:41:03.676
GENDER TO COME FORWARD SO EVEN

05:41:03.743 --> 05:41:06.145
IF THE WOMAN'S MENSTRUAL.

05:41:06.212 --> 05:41:08.781
CRAMPS MEDICINE AS AT A LOWER

05:41:08.848 --> 05:41:10.516
PRICE THAN THE REGULAR ADVIL --

05:41:10.583 --> 05:41:12.451
A MAN COULD COME FORWARD AND SAY

05:41:12.518 --> 05:41:14.086
THAT'S GENDER DISCRIMINATION AND

05:41:14.153 --> 05:41:15.354
I WOULD LIKE TO BRING A LAWSUIT

05:41:15.421 --> 05:41:16.989
AGAIN AGAINST THE BUSINESS FOR

05:41:17.056 --> 05:41:18.524
HAVING A LOT HIGHER PRICE FOR

05:41:18.591 --> 05:41:19.992
MEN'S PRODUCTS.

05:41:20.059 --> 05:41:21.360
THE GENDER SERVICES TARA TAX

05:41:21.427 --> 05:41:22.962
REPEAL ACT THERE WAS A AN

05:41:23.029 --> 05:41:23.930
ATTORNEY WHICH IS REFERENCED

05:41:23.996 --> 05:41:25.331
DOWN IN THE ANALYSIS DOWN IN

05:41:25.398 --> 05:41:26.566
RIVERSIDE COUNTY.

05:41:26.632 --> 05:41:28.067
AND THE ATTORNEY WHEN AFTER

05:41:28.134 --> 05:41:29.402
APPROXIMATELY FIVE MINORITY

05:41:29.468 --> 05:41:31.571
OWNED BUSINESSES WHO WERE --

05:41:31.637 --> 05:41:34.040
BARBERS SALONS AND DRY CLEANERS

05:41:34.106 --> 05:41:36.709
AND SUED THEM UNDER THE EXISTING

05:41:36.776 --> 05:41:38.644
STATUTORY ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM

05:41:38.711 --> 05:41:39.712
FOR NOT JUST THE MINIMUM

05:41:39.779 --> 05:41:41.547
STATUTORY DAMAGES BUT THERE IS

05:41:41.614 --> 05:41:43.983
AN EXAMPLE IN WHICH EIGHT FEMALE

05:41:44.050 --> 05:41:45.451
WHO OWNED A DRY CLEANER WAS --

05:41:45.518 --> 05:41:50.289
REQUESTED TO DEMAND OF OVER A

05:41:50.356 --> 05:41:50.857
HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR

05:41:50.923 --> 05:41:52.058
TWENTY CENT DIFFERENCE AND DRY

05:41:52.124 --> 05:41:52.325
CLEANING.

05:41:52.391 --> 05:41:52.859
AND YES THAT ATTORNEY WAS

05:41:52.925 --> 05:41:53.759
ULTIMATELY CONVICTED BUT THE

05:41:53.826 --> 05:41:55.328
LITIGATION WENT ON FOR ALMOST

05:41:55.394 --> 05:41:57.063
NINE MONTHS AND THOSE BUSINESSES

05:41:57.129 --> 05:41:58.865
HAD TO GO THROUGH THE COST OF

05:41:58.931 --> 05:42:00.433
DEFENSE IN LITIGATION TO PROVE.

05:42:00.499 --> 05:42:01.734
THAT THEIR PRICE DIFFERENTIALS

05:42:01.801 --> 05:42:03.569
WERE NOT BASED UPON GENDER BUT

05:42:03.636 --> 05:42:04.804
THEY'RE A BASED UPON SKILL

05:42:04.871 --> 05:42:06.906
EFFORT IN TIME THAT COST IS WHAT

05:42:06.973 --> 05:42:08.374
I'M TALKING ABOUT WHEN YOU GET A

05:42:08.441 --> 05:42:09.809
DEMAND LETTER FOR FOUR THOUSAND

05:42:09.876 --> 05:42:10.076
DOLLARS.

05:42:10.142 --> 05:42:11.177
AND HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE COST

05:42:11.244 --> 05:42:12.478
OF DEFENSE THAT YOU'RE GOING TO

05:42:12.545 --> 05:42:13.613
HAVE TO FACE THE PROOF

05:42:13.679 --> 05:42:14.914
ULTIMATELY THAT IT WASN'T A

05:42:14.981 --> 05:42:17.450
GENDER BASIS FOR THE

05:42:17.516 --> 05:42:19.919
DIFFERENTIAL IN PRICE.

05:42:19.986 --> 05:42:21.988
THANK YOU CENTER ALLEN YOU MADE

05:42:22.054 --> 05:42:22.421

05:42:22.488 --> 05:42:23.890
THIS THANK.

05:42:23.956 --> 05:42:25.224
SOME OF THE STUFF SOME OF THE

05:42:25.291 --> 05:42:26.158
STATISTICS ELEVEN REYES BY THE

05:42:26.225 --> 05:42:27.126
CENTER TROUBLING DOES IT MEAN

05:42:27.193 --> 05:42:28.494
DOES THIS.

05:42:28.561 --> 05:42:30.129
DOES IT BOTHER YOU THAT THAT

05:42:30.196 --> 05:42:31.397
THERE IS THIS PRICE DIFFERENTIAL

05:42:31.464 --> 05:42:32.498
THE AT THAT THAT WOMEN ARE

05:42:32.565 --> 05:42:33.933
PAYING SO MUCH MORE THAN MEN AND

05:42:34.000 --> 05:42:34.967
WHAT HOW TO HOW DO YOU RESPOND.

05:42:35.034 --> 05:42:37.236
WE GONNA ASK HER IN HER CAPACITY

05:42:37.303 --> 05:42:38.537
WORKING WITH THE CHAMBER OR

05:42:38.604 --> 05:42:40.473
COOPER CAPACITIES WOMAN ALL OF

05:42:40.539 --> 05:42:41.841
THOSE ARE TWO DIFFERENT ISSUES

05:42:41.908 --> 05:42:43.242
YOU KNOW I MEAN BOTH THAT'S WHY

05:42:43.309 --> 05:42:46.879
I WANT TO BE CLEAR.

05:42:46.946 --> 05:42:48.381
ORDER THE STUFF.

05:42:48.447 --> 05:42:50.049
LOOK I I DON'T HAVE I WILL SAY

05:42:50.116 --> 05:42:50.383
THIS.

05:42:50.449 --> 05:42:51.517
IF IT THEY'RE THE EXACT SAME

05:42:51.584 --> 05:42:52.752
PRODUCTS AND WE'RE LOOKING AT IN

05:42:52.818 --> 05:42:54.420
THE EXACT SAME WAY THEN I WOULD

05:42:54.487 --> 05:42:56.122
LIKE TO KNOW WHAT THE REASONING

05:42:56.188 --> 05:42:57.823
IS FOR THAT BUT I DON'T THINK.

05:42:57.890 --> 05:42:59.358
THAT THIS BILL DEALS WITH THE

05:42:59.425 --> 05:43:00.693
EXACT SAME PRODUCT IT DEALS WITH

05:43:00.760 --> 05:43:01.928
SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR PRODUCTS

05:43:01.994 --> 05:43:03.562
AND I THINK THERE IS A VARIETY

05:43:03.629 --> 05:43:05.564
OF REASONS AS TO WHY YOU CAN

05:43:05.631 --> 05:43:06.899
HAVE A PRICE DIFFERENTIAL.

05:43:06.966 --> 05:43:08.601
AND I THINK THAT HAVING THAT

05:43:08.668 --> 05:43:10.336
PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION WITH THE

05:43:10.403 --> 05:43:11.203
MINIMUM FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS

05:43:11.270 --> 05:43:12.838
EXACERBATES THAT PROBLEM OF

05:43:12.905 --> 05:43:13.906
TRYING TO PROVE WHAT THE GENDER

05:43:13.973 --> 05:43:15.875
NEUTRAL REASON IT'S I ALSO THERE

05:43:15.942 --> 05:43:16.976
IS A PART OF ME.

05:43:17.043 --> 05:43:18.344
THAT BELIEVES THAT I AS A

05:43:18.411 --> 05:43:20.246
CONSUMER AS A FEMALE CONSUMER

05:43:20.313 --> 05:43:21.347
CAN MAKE AN INDIVIDUAL

05:43:21.414 --> 05:43:22.982
DETERMINATION OF WHAT PRODUCT I

05:43:23.049 --> 05:43:24.750
WANT TO BUY AND IF I WANT THE

05:43:24.817 --> 05:43:26.819
PAIN PRODUCT AND I WANT TO PAY

05:43:26.886 --> 05:43:27.653
TWENTY CENTS MORE FOR THE PING

05:43:27.720 --> 05:43:28.220
PRODUCT.

05:43:28.287 --> 05:43:29.388
THEN THAT'S MY INDIVIDUAL

05:43:29.455 --> 05:43:31.057
DETERMINATION AS A CONSUMER AND

05:43:31.123 --> 05:43:32.158
IF I DON'T WANT TO PAY IT THEN I

05:43:32.224 --> 05:43:33.592
DON'T WANT TO PAY IT I THINK IT

05:43:33.659 --> 05:43:35.227
WOULD BE VERY DIFFERENT AGAIN AS

05:43:35.294 --> 05:43:36.896
A POINT BACK EARLIER IF I WAS AT

05:43:36.963 --> 05:43:38.030
THE POINT OF SALE AT THE

05:43:38.097 --> 05:43:38.597
REGISTER.

05:43:38.664 --> 05:43:39.732
AND THE CLERK SAID YOU'RE A

05:43:39.799 --> 05:43:40.967
WOMAN AND I'M GONNA PAY ARE

05:43:41.033 --> 05:43:42.301
CHARGING MORE FOR THIS EXACT

05:43:42.368 --> 05:43:43.602
SAME PRODUCT BECAUSE YOUR WOMEN

05:43:43.669 --> 05:43:44.904
THAT'S NOT GOING ON RIGHT NOW

05:43:44.971 --> 05:43:47.773
AND I HAVE THE CHOICE TO DECIDE

05:43:47.840 --> 05:43:48.341
WHAT PRODUCT I'M ULTIMATELY

05:43:48.407 --> 05:43:49.208
GOING TO BUY.

05:43:49.275 --> 05:43:50.609
THANK YOU CENTER OLOGY HAVE

05:43:50.676 --> 05:43:53.946
ANYMORE QUESTIONS -- I I HAVE A

05:43:54.013 --> 05:43:55.548
COUPLE OF QUESTIONS I WASN'T

05:43:55.614 --> 05:43:57.416
PLANNING ON ON SPEAKING ON ON

05:43:57.483 --> 05:43:58.417
THIS.

05:43:58.484 --> 05:43:59.652
BUT I WAS TRYING.

05:43:59.719 --> 05:44:01.187
TO TRYING TO FIGURE OUT.

05:44:01.253 --> 05:44:03.155
HOW DO YOU?

05:44:03.222 --> 05:44:04.156
CREATE THAT APPLE TO APPLE

05:44:04.223 --> 05:44:05.891
COMPARISON.

05:44:05.958 --> 05:44:07.927
IN YEARS MENTIONED -- WHAT YOU

05:44:07.994 --> 05:44:11.297
JUST WENT -- THAT DIFFICULTY.

05:44:11.364 --> 05:44:12.665
THE EXTERNALITIES IN THE

05:44:12.732 --> 05:44:14.467
MARKETPLACE ARE SO VARIED AND

05:44:14.533 --> 05:44:16.602
COMPLEX.

05:44:16.669 --> 05:44:20.272
I WOULDN'T KNOW HOW TO BEGIN.

05:44:20.339 --> 05:44:23.209
FINDING THAT APPLE TO APPLE.

05:44:23.275 --> 05:44:24.977
UNLESS THEY'RE FROM THE SAME

05:44:25.044 --> 05:44:26.345
MANUFACTURER.

05:44:26.412 --> 05:44:29.348
WITH THE SAME DIES WITH THE SAME.

05:44:29.415 --> 05:44:31.951
OUR MANUFACTURING PROCESS SEES.

05:44:32.018 --> 05:44:33.552
EVER.

05:44:33.619 --> 05:44:35.054
AND THEN THE SAME ADVERTISING

05:44:35.121 --> 05:44:36.255
BUDGET THESE ARE THINGS THAT YOU

05:44:36.322 --> 05:44:37.857
JUST CAN'T.

05:44:37.923 --> 05:44:40.559
IN CAPSULE EIGHT EASILY.

05:44:40.626 --> 05:44:42.995
AND DOES IT FRUSTRATE ME WHEN I

05:44:43.062 --> 05:44:45.598
GO TO SUPERCUTS FOR MY FIFTEEN

05:44:45.664 --> 05:44:49.802
DOLLAR HAIR CUT AND MY WIFE GOES.

05:44:49.869 --> 05:44:51.303
TO ONE THAT I THINK IS EQUALLY

05:44:51.370 --> 05:44:53.806
COMPETENT AND SHE GETS CHARGED

05:44:53.873 --> 05:44:55.074
EIGHTY TWO I THINK THAT'S FAIR.

05:44:55.141 --> 05:44:56.842
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

05:44:56.909 --> 05:44:58.611
DO I THINK THAT MY WIFE HAS A

05:44:58.677 --> 05:45:00.946
CHOICE NOT TO TO BLOW EIGHTY

05:45:01.013 --> 05:45:03.215
DOLLARS ON A SUBSTANTIALLY

05:45:03.282 --> 05:45:05.551
SIMILAR HAIR CUT IF YOU WILL --

05:45:05.618 --> 05:45:07.219
THAT'S CONSUMER WISDOM.

05:45:07.286 --> 05:45:09.188
AND YOU CAN'T REGULATE OR

05:45:09.255 --> 05:45:11.223
LEGISLATE STUPID.

05:45:11.290 --> 05:45:12.491
AND THAT'S WHAT I THINK WE'RE

05:45:12.558 --> 05:45:14.760
ASKING OURSELVES HERE WE ARE

05:45:14.827 --> 05:45:15.795
TRYING.

05:45:15.861 --> 05:45:17.496
TO TO CREATE A PROBLEM WHICH IS

05:45:17.563 --> 05:45:20.166
INDEED I THINK REAL.

05:45:20.232 --> 05:45:22.101
BUT THE MECHANISM BY WHICH WE

05:45:22.168 --> 05:45:23.069
WOULD GO.

05:45:23.135 --> 05:45:24.203
IN THE LAKES TO WHICH WE WOULD

05:45:24.270 --> 05:45:27.907
GO TO MODIFY IT AND CHANGE THAT.

05:45:27.973 --> 05:45:31.210
WOULD BE SO ONEROUS.

05:45:31.277 --> 05:45:33.979
AND I THINK CREDIBILITY WOULD BE

05:45:34.046 --> 05:45:35.981
ENHANCE AND ALSO ALL AND OPPOSE

05:45:36.048 --> 05:45:37.950
THIS TO CENTER JACKSON.

05:45:38.017 --> 05:45:40.453
WOULD YOU CONSIDER.

05:45:40.519 --> 05:45:43.089
YES THERE IS A I WANT YOU TO

05:45:43.155 --> 05:45:43.722
COME WITH ME TO SUPERCUTS EXT I

05:45:43.789 --> 05:45:45.024
BY THE WAY.

05:45:45.091 --> 05:45:47.026
WOULD YOU CONSIDER.

05:45:47.093 --> 05:45:50.663
AMENDING -- YOUR ITEM. TO TAKE

05:45:50.729 --> 05:45:52.898

05:45:52.965 --> 05:45:55.067
IN INSTEAD MAYBE EVEN PUT THIS

05:45:55.134 --> 05:45:59.004
INTO THE CONSUMER -- PART CENTER

05:45:59.071 --> 05:46:00.272
TO CONSUMER PROTECTION.

05:46:00.339 --> 05:46:02.141
REGULATORY SCHEME YOU KNOW I'M

05:46:02.208 --> 05:46:04.477
NOT PREPARED TO UNDERMINE THE EN

05:46:04.543 --> 05:46:06.112
ROUTE CIVIL RIGHTS ACTED THIS

05:46:06.178 --> 05:46:09.482
POINT I AM MORE THAN HAPPY. TO

05:46:09.548 --> 05:46:11.083
TO TALK APPLES TO APPLES AND

05:46:11.150 --> 05:46:14.520
APPLES TO APPLES ARE -- SERVICES

05:46:14.587 --> 05:46:16.589
IN GOOD STEAD ARE BASED ON

05:46:16.655 --> 05:46:20.926
GENDER -- I BELIEVE AT TWO TWO

05:46:20.993 --> 05:46:22.828
NINE NEUTER. TO NEUTER PEOPLE'S

05:46:22.895 --> 05:46:25.898
RIGHTS -- BECAUSE YOU HAVE ONE

05:46:25.965 --> 05:46:27.766
OR TWO BAD APPLES AND THAT'S IT

05:46:27.833 --> 05:46:29.268
WE KEEP TALKING ABOUT THIS GUY

05:46:29.335 --> 05:46:30.369
IN RIVERSIDE.

05:46:30.436 --> 05:46:32.104
THIS KIND RIVERSIDE HAS GONE TO

05:46:32.171 --> 05:46:34.940
PRISON FOR WHAT HE'S DONE DOES

05:46:35.007 --> 05:46:36.709
THAT MEAN THAT ALL WOMEN SHOULD

05:46:36.775 --> 05:46:38.811
HAVE TO PAY MORE FOR PRODUCTS.

05:46:38.878 --> 05:46:40.946
BECAUSE THERE'S ONE CREEP DOWN

05:46:41.013 --> 05:46:42.882
IN RIVERSIDE THAT WE'VE NOW PUT

05:46:42.948 --> 05:46:44.717

IT WE SHOULD WE SHOULDN'T HAVE

05:46:48.120 --> 05:46:49.522
THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION

05:46:49.588 --> 05:46:51.257
BECAUSE THERE'S ONE BAD APPLE

05:46:51.323 --> 05:46:53.325
THERE OR CAN WE TRY TO DO

05:46:53.392 --> 05:46:54.927
SOMETHING THAT MAKE SURE THAT

05:46:54.994 --> 05:46:56.595

BUT ALSO TO REVERT TO REFER A

05:47:03.035 --> 05:47:05.171
CONSUMER WISDOM VERSUS STUPID

05:47:05.237 --> 05:47:07.540
FRANKLY IS AN INSULT TO WOMEN.

05:47:07.606 --> 05:47:10.075
WE WE DON'T SPEND ALL DAY LONG

05:47:10.142 --> 05:47:12.077
WALKING AROUND THE STORE TO

05:47:12.144 --> 05:47:14.079
COMPARE PRICES BECAUSE USUALLY

05:47:14.146 --> 05:47:16.482
WE GOT A BABY OR TWO ONE HAND OR

05:47:16.549 --> 05:47:17.983
WEAR COME RUNNING HOME FROM WORK

05:47:18.050 --> 05:47:19.685
BECAUSE WE HAVE TO MAKE DINNER.

05:47:19.752 --> 05:47:20.953
AND HAD TO STAY LATE AT THE

05:47:22.588 --> 05:47:24.990
KIDS TO WILL LESSEN I MEAN.

05:47:25.057 --> 05:47:29.595
YOU KNOW THIS THIS KIND OF THING.

05:47:29.662 --> 05:47:30.129
IS IT IS JUST DENYING THE

05:47:30.196 --> 05:47:32.164
REALITY OF THE WORLD WE LIVE IN

05:47:32.231 --> 05:47:34.567

YOUR WIFE SAYS I WANT TO GO TO A

HAIRDRESSER.

CHARGE OF TEN BECAUSE THAT'S THE

05:47:48.347 --> 05:47:50.449
THAT'S THE COMPARISON IT AND IN

05:47:50.516 --> 05:47:52.985
OUR BILL HERE WE HAVE UNDER THE

05:47:53.052 --> 05:47:54.420
MARKUP AMENDMENTS.

05:47:54.486 --> 05:47:56.055
NO BUSINESS ESTABLISHMENT OF ANY

05:47:56.121 --> 05:47:57.790
KIND WHATSOEVER MAY DISCRIMINATE

05:47:57.856 --> 05:47:59.725
WITH THE PRICE -- CHARGE FOR

GOODS OF ANY TO CONSUMER

05:48:02.161 --> 05:48:03.095
PRODUCTS FROM THE SAME

05:48:03.162 --> 05:48:04.563
MANUFACTURER.

05:48:04.630 --> 05:48:06.532
THAT ARE SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR

05:48:06.599 --> 05:48:07.566
IF SUCH PRODUCTS A PRICE

05:48:07.633 --> 05:48:09.335
DIFFERENTLY SO WHEN YOU TALK

05:48:09.401 --> 05:48:10.736
ABOUT THE COMPLEXITIES OF THE

05:48:10.803 --> 05:48:13.072
MARKET PLACE WE RECOGNIZE THAT

05:48:13.138 --> 05:48:14.506
WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS

05:48:14.573 --> 05:48:15.908
ISOLATE.

05:48:15.975 --> 05:48:17.676
THE KIND OF DISCRIMINATION THAT

05:48:17.743 --> 05:48:20.179
WE SEE AN AS EXISTED FOR YEARS

05:48:20.246 --> 05:48:22.281
BASED ON GENDER AND TO CALL

05:48:22.348 --> 05:48:23.916
WOMEN'S TOO BUT I HOPE YOU

05:48:23.983 --> 05:48:26.018
DIDN'T MEAN THAT BECAUSE WE YOU

05:48:26.085 --> 05:48:26.986
KNOW.

05:48:27.052 --> 05:48:28.387
THE PRODUCTS ARE PLACED IN

05:48:28.454 --> 05:48:30.155
DIFFERENT PLACES FOR A REASON

05:48:30.222 --> 05:48:32.891
SMART MARKETERS WILL DO THAT BUT

05:48:32.958 --> 05:48:34.226
THEY'RE STILL CHARGING WOMEN

05:48:34.293 --> 05:48:36.228
MORE AND WOMEN ARE STILL.

05:48:36.295 --> 05:48:37.630
PAYING A THOUSAND DOLLARS OR

05:48:37.696 --> 05:48:39.932
MORE A EAR IT EVERY WOMAN IN

05:48:39.999 --> 05:48:41.867
THE STATE BECAUSE OF THAT KIND

05:48:41.934 --> 05:48:43.168
OF DISPARITY OKAY SO THAT

05:48:43.235 --> 05:48:45.237
DISCRIMINATION ME AND I WANT TO

05:48:45.304 --> 05:48:47.139
GO BACK TO THE QUESTION.

05:48:47.206 --> 05:48:49.608
I ASKED IF YOU WOULD CONSIDER --

05:48:49.675 --> 05:48:52.411
THE THE THEIR PRIVATE RIGHT OF

05:48:52.478 --> 05:48:54.413
ACTION BECAUSE IT THE END GOAL

05:48:54.480 --> 05:48:55.814
OF THE QUESTIONNAIRE TAURUS I

05:48:55.881 --> 05:48:58.183
THINK IT IS WHEN YOU HAVE

05:48:58.250 --> 05:48:59.818
SITUATIONS AS DISPARATE.

05:48:59.885 --> 05:49:04.089
IN OBVIOUS AS THE EXAMPLES WE'VE

05:49:04.156 --> 05:49:04.623
HEARD.

05:49:04.690 --> 05:49:05.991
IF YOU WANT TO CHANGE POLICY

05:49:06.058 --> 05:49:07.493
COULD NOT BE AFFECTED WITHOUT A

05:49:07.559 --> 05:49:09.395
PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION INSTEAD

05:49:09.461 --> 05:49:11.830
MAKE IT A CONSUMER PROTECTION.

05:49:11.897 --> 05:49:13.599
WELL UNDER PRESSURE THE PROBLEM

05:49:13.666 --> 05:49:15.434
IS UNDER CONSUMER PROTECTION AND

05:49:15.501 --> 05:49:17.169
I KNOW CENTER COPIER ON THOSE AS

05:49:17.236 --> 05:49:19.071
WELL WE HAVE DIFFERENT DIFFERENT

05:49:19.138 --> 05:49:21.707
ABILITIES TO ENFORCE AND IF WE

05:49:21.774 --> 05:49:23.242
DON'T HAVE ENOUGH RESOURCES

05:49:23.309 --> 05:49:25.177
AVAILABLE TO THAT ENFORCEMENT

05:49:25.244 --> 05:49:26.912
AGENCY NOTHING HAPPENS.

05:49:26.979 --> 05:49:28.047
AND THAT'S BEEN PART OF THE

05:49:28.113 --> 05:49:29.315
PROBLEM ON ISSUES.

05:49:29.381 --> 05:49:31.417
LAW SUCH AS THIS THERE IS NO

05:49:31.483 --> 05:49:33.585
HAMMER THERE. TO TO REQUIRE

05:49:33.652 --> 05:49:35.187
ANYBODY TO DO ANYTHING BECAUSE

05:49:35.254 --> 05:49:36.488
WE DON'T HAVE A STRONG

05:49:36.555 --> 05:49:38.757
ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM NOW.

05:49:38.824 --> 05:49:40.492
AM I WILLING TO TALK ABOUT A WAY

05:49:40.559 --> 05:49:41.760
SO THAT WE HAVE A STRONG

05:49:41.827 --> 05:49:43.662
ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM BUT WE

05:49:43.729 --> 05:49:47.199
DON'T CATCH IN THAT WAY OF SMALL

05:49:47.266 --> 05:49:51.904
BUSINESSES ABSOLUTELY HAPPY TO

05:49:51.970 --> 05:49:52.137
DO THAT.

05:49:52.204 --> 05:49:52.971
WE WILL.

05:49:53.038 --> 05:49:54.039
I CAN REMIND THE COMMITTEE WE

05:49:54.106 --> 05:49:54.940
HAVE A MOTION -- ON THE DíAS

05:49:55.007 --> 05:49:58.510
AND AT I THINK WE'RE KIND OF

05:49:58.577 --> 05:50:00.979
MOVE AROUND IN CIRCLES NOW

05:50:01.046 --> 05:50:01.280
[inaudible]

05:50:01.347 --> 05:50:05.951
I POINT POINT POINT TAKEN -- BUT

05:50:06.018 --> 05:50:07.519
I I DO HAVE A ANOTHER ANOTHER

05:50:07.586 --> 05:50:09.021
ANOTHER QUESTION.

05:50:09.088 --> 05:50:10.823
THE IDEA THOUGH.

05:50:10.889 --> 05:50:13.625
THE IDEA THOUGH IS THAT IF I

05:50:13.692 --> 05:50:15.594
DON'T WANT TO IN RICH I DON'T

05:50:15.661 --> 05:50:16.295
WANT TO IN RICH.

05:50:16.362 --> 05:50:20.065
ATTORNEYS -- BUT I THINK THE END

05:50:20.132 --> 05:50:21.800
GOAL IS THAT THERE IS SOME

05:50:21.867 --> 05:50:24.036
DISPARITY BUT YOU CAN'T QUANTIFY.

05:50:24.103 --> 05:50:25.771
AND YOU CAN'T.

05:50:25.838 --> 05:50:27.539
CREATE ENOUGH APPLES APPLES IN

05:50:27.606 --> 05:50:29.274
LEAST IN MY OPINION IN WAYS THAT

05:50:29.341 --> 05:50:31.276
WOULD -- ALLOW THE SMALL

05:50:31.343 --> 05:50:32.978
BUSINESSES THAT SENATE CENTER

05:50:33.045 --> 05:50:35.447
COVER EURO HAD TALKED ABOUT --

05:50:35.514 --> 05:50:36.949

05:50:42.087 --> 05:50:44.490
ADVICE OF MY ESTEEMED COLLEAGUE
