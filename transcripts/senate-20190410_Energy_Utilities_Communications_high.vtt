THE DOOR FOR THE MANY NEW

00:02:00.487 --> 00:02:02.489
TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATIONS LIKE

00:02:02.555 --> 00:02:05.124
APPS AND SMART FINANCES.

00:02:05.191 --> 00:02:06.593
THAT.

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:07.927
CUSTOMERS TO CONNECT WITH THEIR

00:02:07.994 --> 00:02:09.929
SMART METERS.

00:02:09.996 --> 00:02:12.298
AND CHIEF BETTER ENERGY DEMANDS

00:02:12.365 --> 00:02:13.466
MANAGEMENT.

00:02:13.533 --> 00:02:15.335
SO WHY IS IT THAT WE NEED BETTER

00:02:15.401 --> 00:02:16.436
DEMAND MANAGEMENT.

00:02:16.503 --> 00:02:18.972
AS ALL OF US KNOW CALIFORNIA NOW

00:02:19.038 --> 00:02:20.607
HAS A 100%.

00:02:20.673 --> 00:02:22.609
GOAL TO ACHIEVE.

00:02:22.675 --> 00:02:24.344
BE A 100% OF OUR ELECTRICITY

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.413
GENERATED FROM RENEWABLE SOURCES.

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.649
AS WE ALSO KNOW RENEWABLE

00:02:29.716 --> 00:02:32.185
ELECTRICITY EXCEPT FOR A FEW OF

00:02:32.252 --> 00:02:34.988
LIKE GEO THERMAL IS NOT.

00:02:35.054 --> 00:02:37.557
TWENTY FOUR SEVEN SO IF WE CAN.

00:02:37.624 --> 00:02:40.593
MODIFY WHEN ELECTRICITY DEMAND

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.062
IS SO WE CAN REDUCE IT PEAK.

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:46.933
THEN WE ARE ABLE TO UTILIZE OUR

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.334
RENEWABLE RESOURCES BETTER.

00:02:48.401 --> 00:02:51.004
AND HAVE LESS DEPENDENCE ON

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:53.406
FOSSIL FUEL BACK UP.

00:02:53.473 --> 00:02:55.975
NOW WHAT IS THE BILL EXPLICITLY

00:02:56.042 --> 00:02:58.011
DUE TO OPEN UP THESE OPPORTUNITY.

00:02:58.077 --> 00:02:59.879
OUR ENERGY COMMISSION HAS THE

00:02:59.946 --> 00:03:01.948
AUTHORITY NOW TO SET APPOINT

00:03:02.015 --> 00:03:04.517
STANDARDS FOR ENERGY EFFICIENCY.

00:03:04.584 --> 00:03:06.319
HOWEVER THEY CANNOT SET

00:03:06.386 --> 00:03:08.421
STANDARDS TO ENCOURAGE THOSE

00:03:08.488 --> 00:03:10.123
POINTS IS TO BE WHAT WE CALL

00:03:10.189 --> 00:03:10.857
SMART.

00:03:10.924 --> 00:03:11.991
SO IN OTHER WORDS SO THOSE

00:03:12.058 --> 00:03:13.960
APPLIANCES ARE ABLE TO BE

00:03:14.027 --> 00:03:14.894
REMOTELY.

00:03:14.961 --> 00:03:17.830
IMPACT REMOTELY CONTROLLED OFF

00:03:17.897 --> 00:03:19.332
ON LOWERING.

00:03:19.399 --> 00:03:20.266
LEFT FOR EXAMPLE WITH AN AIR

00:03:20.333 --> 00:03:21.935
CONDITIONER LOWERING THE

00:03:22.001 --> 00:03:23.770
TEMPERATURE ARE INCREASING THE

00:03:23.836 --> 00:03:25.738
TEMPERATURE OR HOWEVER.

00:03:25.805 --> 00:03:27.640
SO WHAT THIS DOES IS ALLOWS THE

00:03:27.707 --> 00:03:33.813
CDC TO INCLUDE -- SETTING OF

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:34.814
BUILDING CODE STANDARDS FOR OUR

00:03:34.881 --> 00:03:35.748
EXCUSE ME APPLIANCE STANDARDS

00:03:35.815 --> 00:03:36.749
FOR DEMAND RESPONSE MEANING

00:03:36.816 --> 00:03:37.216
SUPPORTING THOSE SMART

00:03:37.283 --> 00:03:38.418
APPLIANCES.

00:03:38.484 --> 00:03:40.286
AND CLARIFYING THAT THE CDC CAN

00:03:40.353 --> 00:03:42.689
CONSIDER GREENHOUSE GASES

00:03:42.755 --> 00:03:44.591
BECAUSE IF THE C. E. C. IN

00:03:44.657 --> 00:03:46.292
SETTING THE STANDARDS.

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:48.995
CAN ONLY INCORPORATE ENERGY

00:03:49.062 --> 00:03:53.600
EFFICIENCY.

00:03:53.666 --> 00:03:54.634
IT DOES NOT ALLOW.

00:03:54.701 --> 00:03:55.535
FOR MOVING DEMAND ISN'T

00:03:55.602 --> 00:03:59.606
NECESSARILY A ROOF A A A

00:03:59.672 --> 00:04:02.442
REDUCTION IN ELECTRICITY USE

00:04:02.508 --> 00:04:04.611
IT'S MORE JUST THE SHIFTING OF

00:04:04.677 --> 00:04:06.245
WHEN WE USE THAT ELECTRICITY.

00:04:06.312 --> 00:04:09.148
SO THAT'S WHY THE BILL.

00:04:09.215 --> 00:04:11.384
ALLOWS THE CDC TO HAVE THAT

00:04:11.451 --> 00:04:12.719
OTHER AUTHORITY.

00:04:12.785 --> 00:04:15.021

OVER 90% OF THAT RENEWABLE

00:15:09.074 --> 00:15:10.643
NATURAL GAS IN NORTH AMERICA --

00:15:10.709 --> 00:15:11.777
WE'RE ACTUALLY HAVE A TWEENER

00:15:11.844 --> 00:15:13.078
POSITION TODAY WERE NOT AN

00:15:13.145 --> 00:15:15.214
OFFICIAL -- OPPOSITION TO THE

00:15:15.281 --> 00:15:15.748
BILL WE'RE HOPING TO WORK

00:15:15.814 --> 00:15:17.182
THROUGH THIS ISSUE I'M WITH THE

00:15:17.249 --> 00:15:18.317
AUTHOR AND WITH THE COMMITTEE

00:15:18.384 --> 00:15:20.152
AND WE AGREE WITH CENTER ARE TO

00:15:20.219 --> 00:15:20.853
LET ITS GOAL.

00:15:20.919 --> 00:15:23.522
OF ADDING HYDROGEN TO STATUTES

00:15:23.589 --> 00:15:24.590
THAT INCENTIVIZE THE USE IT'S

00:15:24.657 --> 00:15:26.191
YOUR MISSION VEHICLES -- BUT AS

00:15:26.258 --> 00:15:26.725
YOU'RE ACTUALLY COMMITTEE

00:15:26.792 --> 00:15:28.193
ANALYSIS POINTS OUT THE

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:29.628
DEFINITION IN THIS BILL.

00:15:29.695 --> 00:15:31.697
EXCLUDES SEVERAL OTHER FORMS OF

00:15:31.764 --> 00:15:33.532
RENEWABLE AND NON FOSSEL

00:15:33.599 --> 00:15:35.534
HYDROGEN MANY OF THEM -- ARE

00:15:35.601 --> 00:15:37.036
MORE MATURE AND MORE COST

00:15:37.102 --> 00:15:39.338
EFFECTIVE INCLUDING -- RENEWABLE

00:15:39.405 --> 00:15:41.106
HYDROGEN MADE FROM RENEWABLE

00:15:41.173 --> 00:15:45.010
NATURAL GAS WHO ARE THE FOLKS

00:15:45.077 --> 00:15:45.577
THAT I REPRESENT [inaudible]

00:15:45.644 --> 00:15:47.680
I'M.

00:15:47.746 --> 00:15:48.314
AS FOR ME GIVE ME NOW SAYS ALSO

00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:49.081
POINTS OUT THE CARBON INTENSITY

00:15:49.148 --> 00:15:50.149
OF THIS YOU'LL HAS THE POTENTIAL

00:15:50.215 --> 00:15:50.983
TO VERY WIDELY ACCORDING TO FEED

00:15:51.050 --> 00:15:51.216
STOCK.

00:15:51.283 --> 00:15:52.351
I'M SOME OF THAT MAY BE TAKEN

00:15:52.418 --> 00:15:53.419
CARE OF BY THE AMENDMENTS BUT

00:15:53.485 --> 00:15:54.486
THE IRONY HERE IS THAT BY

00:15:54.553 --> 00:15:56.088
EXCLUDING RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS

00:15:56.155 --> 00:15:57.289
ARE ACTUALLY.

00:15:57.356 --> 00:15:58.791
EXCLUDING HYDROGEN THAT HAS A

00:15:58.857 --> 00:16:00.559
NEGATIVE CARBON INTENSITY AND

00:16:00.626 --> 00:16:02.494
LIMITING IT ONLY TWO ZERO

00:16:02.561 --> 00:16:04.863
THEREFORE ANY CONFLICTING WITH

00:16:04.930 --> 00:16:05.597
OUR AYE MICHAELS AND SO.

00:16:05.664 --> 00:16:06.965
OUT WE WOULD ASK THAT THIS.

00:16:07.032 --> 00:16:08.834
BILL BE CHANGED.

00:16:08.901 --> 00:16:09.935
TO INCLUDE SOME OF THESE OTHER

00:16:10.002 --> 00:16:11.170
FORMS OF RENEWABLE NON POSSO

00:16:11.236 --> 00:16:12.538
HYDROGEN EITHER BY CALLING IT

00:16:12.604 --> 00:16:14.139
OUT THAT WAY OR ANOTHER WAYS

00:16:14.206 --> 00:16:18.977
THAT IT'S NOT LIMITED TO ONLY

00:16:19.044 --> 00:16:20.512
ELECTROLYTIC HYDROGEN

00:16:20.579 --> 00:16:20.813
[inaudible]

00:16:20.879 --> 00:16:21.280
THANK YOU [inaudible]

00:16:21.347 --> 00:16:23.816
ANYONE ELSE.

00:16:23.882 --> 00:16:26.752
SPEAKERS IN OPPOSITION.

00:16:26.819 --> 00:16:30.155
OKAY VERY WELL OF COMMITTEE.

00:16:30.222 --> 00:16:32.024
CENTER SKINNER THANK YOU.

00:16:32.091 --> 00:16:35.160
I'M I WILL SUPPORT THE BILL I AM.

00:16:35.227 --> 00:16:36.962
WAS THE AUTHOR OF THE BILL THAT

00:16:37.029 --> 00:16:39.732
LAST YEAR ALLOWED US TO TREAT A

00:16:39.798 --> 00:16:41.300
DEFINITION OF GREEN ELECTROLYTIC

00:16:41.367 --> 00:16:42.401
ARTESIAN.

00:16:42.468 --> 00:16:44.570
I DO THINK THAT THE POINT AROUND

00:16:44.636 --> 00:16:46.338
THE OTHER ëEWABLE

00:16:46.405 --> 00:16:48.574
HYDROGEN.

00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:50.242
ALLOWING THEM TO BE USED IN OUR

00:16:50.309 --> 00:16:51.977
TRANSPORTATION SECTOR.

00:16:52.044 --> 00:16:53.479
IS A VALID POINT.

00:16:53.545 --> 00:16:56.348
AND I THINK THAT IS WORTH THE

00:16:56.415 --> 00:16:56.949
AUTHORS.

00:16:57.015 --> 00:16:59.918
I IN SPONSOR'S CONSIDERATION I

00:16:59.985 --> 00:17:00.886
DON'T THINK WE SHOULD HANG THE

00:17:00.953 --> 00:17:03.122
BILL UP NOW BUT I THINK THAT IS

00:17:03.188 --> 00:17:06.158
A VERY WORTHWHILE CONSIDERATION.

00:17:06.225 --> 00:17:08.894
ON AND I AM ALSO I UNDERSTAND

00:17:08.961 --> 00:17:11.897
WHY THE DEVELOPMENT OF HYDROGEN

00:17:11.964 --> 00:17:15.067
AS A CLEAN -- EITHER ELECTRICITY

00:17:15.134 --> 00:17:16.969
GENERATION SOURCE OR

00:17:17.035 --> 00:17:18.904
TRANSPORTATION SOURCE GOT HUNG

00:17:18.971 --> 00:17:19.705
UP.

00:17:19.772 --> 00:17:23.342
BECAUSE FOR YEARS WE WHEN --

00:17:23.409 --> 00:17:25.544
RENEWABLE BASED ELECTRICITY WAS

00:17:25.611 --> 00:17:27.413
VERY HIGH COST.

00:17:27.479 --> 00:17:29.148
IT WAS NOT COST EFFECTIVE TO

00:17:29.214 --> 00:17:30.849
PRODUCE HYDROGEN TO THAT MEANS

00:17:30.916 --> 00:17:32.451
AND WE WERE MOSTL PRODUCING

00:17:32.518 --> 00:17:34.620
HYDROGEN THROUGH.

00:17:34.686 --> 00:17:36.555
A POSSIBLE FROM A LOSS OF YOUR

00:17:36.622 --> 00:17:39.391
POWER SOURCE SO IN FACT WE WERE

00:17:39.458 --> 00:17:40.325
NOT GETTING MUCH PARDON BENEFIT

00:17:40.392 --> 00:17:41.627
FROM HYDROGEN.

00:17:41.693 --> 00:17:43.629
BUT NOW WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY

00:17:43.695 --> 00:17:47.299
TO REALLY UTILIZE IT IN FACT.

00:17:47.366 --> 00:17:50.602
ANYTIME WERE OVER GENERATING

00:17:50.669 --> 00:17:51.437
ELECTRICITY.

00:17:51.503 --> 00:17:52.237
I'M THAT IS GENERATED FROM

00:17:52.304 --> 00:17:54.139
RENEWABLE SOURCES IT ALLOWS US

00:17:54.206 --> 00:17:56.308
NOW TO PRODUCE HYDROGEN WHICH

00:17:56.375 --> 00:17:57.576
CAN THEN SUPPLANT.

00:17:57.643 --> 00:17:59.778
ANY FOSSIL FUEL WHETHER IT'S IN

00:17:59.845 --> 00:18:01.413
TRANSPORTATION OR OTHER WHICH IS

00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:04.316
REALLY THE TYPE OF CLEAN ENERGY

00:18:04.383 --> 00:18:05.984
DIVERSITY WE WANT TO ACHIEVE.

00:18:06.051 --> 00:18:08.053
SO I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT IT AND

00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:09.721
INTERESTINGLY.

00:18:09.788 --> 00:18:12.057
I USED TO RUN A PROJECT THAT --

00:18:12.124 --> 00:18:13.225
WAS PROMOTING THESE KINDS OF

00:18:13.292 --> 00:18:17.029
THINGS AND BACK IN -- NINETEEN

00:18:17.095 --> 00:18:17.563
NINETY FOUR WE DID A

00:18:17.629 --> 00:18:18.964
DEMONSTRATION OF BALLARD FUEL

00:18:19.031 --> 00:18:22.034
CELL BUSES IN CHICAGO.

00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:24.236
AND THEN MAYOR DALEY CUP UNDER

00:18:24.303 --> 00:18:28.006
THE BE A TAIL PIPE.

00:18:28.073 --> 00:18:31.510
AND DRINK THE EMISSIONS SO THAT

00:18:31.577 --> 00:18:33.378
WAS ONE TV.

00:18:33.445 --> 00:18:34.880
UNFORTUNATELY ARJUN FUEL CELL

00:18:34.947 --> 00:18:36.615
BUSES DID NOT TAKE OFF THE WAY I

00:18:36.682 --> 00:18:37.883
THINK SOME OF US HOPE BUT WE WE

00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:40.085
ARE SEEING THAT TECHNOLOGY.

00:18:40.152 --> 00:18:42.187
A VERY VERY AVAILABLE AND WE ARE

00:18:42.254 --> 00:18:43.956
SEEING NOW THE ABILITY TO POWER

00:18:44.022 --> 00:18:47.359
IT WITH OUR RENEWABLE SOURCES SO

00:18:47.426 --> 00:18:54.132
WITH THAT I MOVE THE BILL.

00:18:54.199 --> 00:18:54.666
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AT

00:18:54.733 --> 00:18:57.269
SENATOR YOU MENTIONED THAT THIS

00:18:57.336 --> 00:18:58.203
WILL NOT ADD COSTS TO RATEPAYERS

00:18:58.270 --> 00:19:00.606
BUT MY RESEARCH IS SHOWING THAT

00:19:00.672 --> 00:19:02.341
IT WILL SO DID YOU.

00:19:02.407 --> 00:19:04.743
HELP EXPLAIN BERMAN TURNOUT DOES

00:19:04.810 --> 00:19:07.779
IT TO THAT THE TECHNICIAN HERE.

00:19:07.846 --> 00:19:08.747
AND YOU CAN AFTER THAT.

00:19:08.814 --> 00:19:10.449
CERTAINLY YEAH THE KEY HERE IS

00:19:10.516 --> 00:19:11.817
PRODUCTION OF ELECTROLYTIC

00:19:11.884 --> 00:19:14.052
HYDROGEN AT A UTILITY SCALE SO

00:19:14.119 --> 00:19:16.522
AS WE CAN PRODUCE HYDROGEN FROM

00:19:16.588 --> 00:19:18.090
ELECTRICITY COSTED BELOW FIVE

00:19:18.156 --> 00:19:19.324
CENTS A KILOWATT HOUR WHICH YOU

00:19:19.391 --> 00:19:21.326
CAN ACHIEVE. FOR PEAVEY AND WIN

00:19:21.393 --> 00:19:22.861
INSTALLATIONS GREATER THAN A

00:19:22.928 --> 00:19:24.530
HUNDRED MEGAWATTS YOU GET TO

00:19:24.596 --> 00:19:25.898
HYDROGEN THAT'S PRODUCED AT

00:19:25.964 --> 00:19:27.432
BELOW PARITY COMPARED TO

00:19:27.499 --> 00:19:31.703
ELECTRICAL RESOURCES EVEN WHEN

00:19:31.770 --> 00:19:32.571
YOU KHôNG CAPITAL.

00:19:32.638 --> 00:19:33.338
AMORTIZED OVER TEN YEARS THAT AS

00:19:33.405 --> 00:19:34.640
ABOUT FIFTY CENTS PER KILOGRAM

00:19:34.706 --> 00:19:36.041
SO BECOMES QUITE AFFORDABLE.

00:19:36.108 --> 00:19:38.277
THE KEY POINT FOR

00:19:38.343 --> 00:19:39.778
ELECTRIFICATION WE LOOK AT SB.

00:19:39.845 --> 00:19:41.079
ONE HUNDRED MOVING UP TO TWENTY

00:19:41.146 --> 00:19:42.247
FORTY FIVE FULL EDUCATION WE

00:19:42.314 --> 00:19:43.415
KNOW WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO

00:19:43.482 --> 00:19:45.217
QUINN OPPLE OR QUADRUPLE THE

00:19:45.284 --> 00:19:46.118
RENEWABLE GENERATION.

00:19:46.184 --> 00:19:48.120
IN CALIFORNIA IF WE DO THAT ALL

00:19:48.186 --> 00:19:49.688
WITH LITHIUM ION TECHNOLOGY

00:19:49.755 --> 00:19:51.523
WE'RE LOKING AT ELECTRIFYING

00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:52.991
AREAS OF THE GRID THAT ARE

00:19:53.058 --> 00:19:54.626
ALREADY VERY ENERGY INTENSE LIKE

00:19:54.693 --> 00:19:55.694
THE LA BASIN.

00:19:55.761 --> 00:19:57.296
LIKE THE BAY AREA DOING THAT

00:19:57.362 --> 00:19:58.864
COST EFFECTIVELY AND IN WAYS

00:19:58.931 --> 00:19:59.731
THAT DO NOT INCREASE

00:19:59.798 --> 00:20:01.700
SUSCEPTIBILITY TO WILDFIRES

00:20:01.767 --> 00:20:03.302
OUTAGES IS GONNA BE VERY

00:20:03.368 --> 00:20:05.971
CHALLENGING AND IT'S WORTHWHILE

00:20:06.038 --> 00:20:06.772
FOR THE UTILITIES TO HAVE THE

00:20:06.838 --> 00:20:08.840
OPTION. FOR PRODUCING FUEL IN

00:20:08.907 --> 00:20:10.142
REMOTE AREAS FROM NEW

00:20:10.208 --> 00:20:11.910
INSTALLATIONS OF WIND AND SOLAR

00:20:11.977 --> 00:20:13.145
AND BEING ABLE TO MOVE THOSE IN

00:20:13.211 --> 00:20:14.646
WAYS THAT DON'T REQUIRE NEW HIGH

00:20:14.713 --> 00:20:16.048
TENSION LINES NEW.

00:20:16.114 --> 00:20:17.349
TRANSMISSION DISTRIBUTION

00:20:17.416 --> 00:20:18.917
INFRASTRUCTURE IN AREAS WHERE IT

00:20:18.984 --> 00:20:20.018
MAKES SENSE.

00:20:20.085 --> 00:20:21.520
AND IN THAT WAY IT'S GOING TO BE

00:20:21.587 --> 00:20:22.854
MUCH MORE COST EFFECTIVE FOR HE

00:20:22.921 --> 00:20:24.389
RATE PAYERS TO HAVE THOSE

00:20:24.456 --> 00:20:25.991
OPTIONS AT THEIR DISPOSAL SO THE

00:20:26.058 --> 00:20:29.461
ANSWER IS MAYBE.

00:20:29.528 --> 00:20:30.896
THE ANSWER IS A DEFINITE YES.

00:20:30.963 --> 00:20:31.897
WE HAVE THE ALTERNATIVE AD

00:20:31.964 --> 00:20:33.599
RENEWABLE FUEL AND VEHICLE

00:20:33.665 --> 00:20:35.100
TECHNOLOGY PROGRAM.

00:20:35.167 --> 00:20:37.235
WHICH PROVIDED A HUNDRED SIXTY

00:20:37.302 --> 00:20:38.670
TWO MILLION WHAT WHAT'S THE

00:20:38.737 --> 00:20:42.007
STATUS OF THAT PROGRAM.

00:20:42.074 --> 00:20:44.109
SO THE CDC HAS FUNDED A NUMBER

00:20:44.176 --> 00:20:46.612
OF INITIATIVES IN IN RESPECT TO

00:20:46.678 --> 00:20:48.981
TRANSPORTATION ELECTRIFICATION --

00:20:49.047 --> 00:20:50.282
THEY HAVE.

00:20:50.349 --> 00:20:52.317
FUNDED PRIMARILY -- BATTERY

00:20:52.384 --> 00:20:53.619
ELECTRIC TECHNOLOGIES AND THEY

00:20:53.685 --> 00:20:54.853
HAVE BEEN DOING THAT ON AN

00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:56.922
ONGOING BASIS SINCE -- THAT

00:20:56.989 --> 00:20:58.323
INITIATIVE PASSED THE

00:20:58.390 --> 00:21:01.259
LEGISLATURE IN TWO THOUSAND AND

00:21:01.326 --> 00:21:03.328
SEVEN FUNDING THAT PROGRAM AT CC.

00:21:03.395 --> 00:21:04.630
SO THEY HAVE BEEN ON AN ONGOING

00:21:04.696 --> 00:21:06.398
BASIS FUNDING PROGRAMS RELATING

00:21:06.465 --> 00:21:07.499
TO BATTERY ELECTRIC TECHNOLOGY

00:21:07.566 --> 00:21:08.800
IMPLEMENTATION THROUGHOUT THE

00:21:08.867 --> 00:21:10.202
STATE AND SOME.

00:21:10.268 --> 00:21:11.436
IN THE HYDROGEN SPACES WELL BUT

00:21:11.503 --> 00:21:13.238
THE DISPARITY AND THE GAP IS

00:21:13.305 --> 00:21:15.273
WIDE LOOKING AT ABOUT ONE POINT

00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:16.642
FIVE BILLION TOTAL STATEWIDE

00:21:16.708 --> 00:21:18.076
INVESTMENTS IN BATTERY ELECTRIC

00:21:18.143 --> 00:21:19.077
TECHNOLOGY.

00:21:19.144 --> 00:21:20.512
AND ABOUT A HUNDRED FORTY

00:21:20.579 --> 00:21:21.947
MILLION IN HYDROGEN -- AND

00:21:22.014 --> 00:21:23.582
THAT'S NOT GOING TO GET US TO

00:21:23.649 --> 00:21:25.217
WHERE WE NEED TO BE IN ORDER FOR

00:21:25.283 --> 00:21:27.285
HYDROGEN TO FILL THOSE GAPS THAT

00:21:27.352 --> 00:21:28.420
WERE MENTIONED EARLIER TODAY

00:21:28.487 --> 00:21:28.720
[inaudible]

00:21:28.787 --> 00:21:32.591
THANK.

00:21:32.658 --> 00:21:35.827
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR.

00:21:35.894 --> 00:21:38.497
AS ONE OF BLOOD YOU.

THERE'S A LOT OF TREES OUT THERE

00:27:31.850 --> 00:27:33.151
AND WE DON'T HAVE EYES ON ALL OF

WE BELIEVE WE REPRESENT ALL OF

00:28:00.378 --> 00:28:01.746
THE LINE CLEAR IT'S A TREE

00:28:01.813 --> 00:28:03.148

00:28:28.807 --> 00:28:30.141
THEIR VIEW.

00:28:30.208 --> 00:28:31.676
THERE WAS AN APPROPRIATE TREE

IS A MOSTLY IMMIGRANT WORKFORCE

00:28:53.798 --> 00:28:55.533
IT'S A LOW WAGE WORKFORCE

00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:56.568
UNFORTUNATELY.

00:28:56.634 --> 00:28:58.403

THREE THOUSAND IN SIX MONTHS

00:29:22.427 --> 00:29:23.895
THAT'S HOW QUICKLY THEY'VE BEEN

00:29:23.962 --> 00:29:26.131
HIRING THAT CONTRACTORS ARE

00:29:26.197 --> 00:29:26.898
COMING FROM OTHER STATES

00:29:33.071 --> 00:29:34.539
THEY SHOW UP AND GOT A FULL CREW.

00:29:34.606 --> 00:29:37.008
THESE WORKERS ARE NOT BEING

00:29:37.075 --> 00:29:39.144
TRAINED APPROPRIATELY.

00:29:39.210 --> 00:29:40.145
HOPING TO GET THE LATEST

00:29:41.479 --> 00:29:42.447
OSHA.

00:29:42.514 --> 00:29:43.815
BUT THE NUMBERS ARE ALARMING

00:29:43.882 --> 00:29:47.218
FROM OCTOBER OF TWENTY TWELVE TO

00:29:47.285 --> 00:29:49.587
SEPTEMBER OF TWENTY FOURTEEN

00:29:49.654 --> 00:29:52.423
THAT'S LESS THAN TWO YEARS.

00:29:52.490 --> 00:29:56.794
SEVENTY FOUR SERIOUS ACCIDENTS.

00:29:56.861 --> 00:29:58.563
FIFTY FOUR REQUIRING

00:29:58.630 --> 00:30:00.598
HOSPITALIZATION.

00:30:00.665 --> 00:30:02.333
AND ELEVEN DEATHS.

00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:04.769
OUR INTERNAL RECORDS INDICATE

00:30:04.836 --> 00:30:06.504
THAT THOSE NUMBERS.

00:30:06.571 --> 00:30:08.139
ARE A LITTLE FAR FEWER THAN

00:30:08.206 --> 00:30:10.341
WHAT'S OCCURRED IN THE LAST

00:30:10.408 --> 00:30:11.809
SIXTEEN TO EIGHTEEN MONTHS.

00:30:11.876 --> 00:30:13.444
BECAUSE THIS IS A MIGRANT

00:30:13.511 --> 00:30:14.612
WORKFORCE.

00:30:14.679 --> 00:30:16.247

00:30:17.849 --> 00:30:19.250
THE NUMBER OF ACCIDENTS GO

00:30:19.317 --> 00:30:22.053
WOEFULLY UNDER REPORTED BECAUSE

00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:22.587
OF INTIMIDATION FROM THE

00:30:22.654 --> 00:30:23.488
CONTRACTORS.

00:30:23.555 --> 00:30:25.356
OR FEAR FOR THEIR FAMILIES IF

00:30:25.423 --> 00:30:26.925
THEY HAVE FAMILY MEMBERS WHO ARE

00:30:26.991 --> 00:30:28.126
UNDOCUMENTED.

00:30:28.193 --> 00:30:29.427
SO THIS WORK FORCE WHAT'S

00:30:29.494 --> 00:30:30.495
HAPPENING IS THEY GO OUT INTO

00:30:30.562 --> 00:30:31.763

AND ONCE THEY GET A LIKE

00:30:39.103 --> 00:30:40.471
BACKWARDS THE CONTRACTOR

00:30:40.538 --> 00:30:43.041
HANDSOME CHAINSAW IS AS GO CUT

00:30:43.107 --> 00:30:44.075

IS REQUIRE THE UTILITIES TO

00:31:07.131 --> 00:31:08.499
THAT THEY'RE SAFER.

00:31:08.566 --> 00:31:10.335

FOOT RANGE BUT THEN THERE'S

00:39:00.504 --> 00:39:02.673
TREES ON A JOINING PRIVATE

00:39:02.740 --> 00:39:03.274

POTENTIALLY IN IN IN IN IN IN

00:39:11.549 --> 00:39:11.916
THE EVENT.

00:39:11.982 --> 00:39:13.584
INTERSECT WITH THE LINES THAT'S

00:39:13.651 --> 00:39:17.755
A VERY SUBJECTIVE THING.

00:39:17.822 --> 00:39:19.924
PROPERTY OWNERS OF THEY DON'T

WITHIN THAT TWELVE FOOT RADIUS

00:39:28.766 --> 00:39:31.202

ON ENERGY STORAGE AND WE THINK

01:20:38.967 --> 01:20:40.268
IT'S AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE

BEFORE WE CHANGE OUR POSITION --

01:21:00.422 --> 01:21:02.624
BUT OUR CONCERNS ARE BASED ON

01:21:02.691 --> 01:21:04.259
THE FACT THAT THE LANGUAGE THAT

01:21:04.326 --> 01:21:05.694

01:21:05.760 --> 01:21:06.761

01:21:20.742 --> 01:21:22.210
STORAGE SYSTEMS AND THEY WOULD

01:21:22.277 --> 01:21:23.478
INCREASE THE AFFORDABILITY

01:21:42.530 --> 01:21:42.931
TERRORISTS.

01:21:42.998 --> 01:21:44.432
IN RULES THAT ATTEMPT TO BALANCE

01:21:44.499 --> 01:21:45.934
THE INTERESTS OF VARIOUS

RELIABILITY AND FAIRLY

01:21:51.873 --> 01:21:52.707
APPORTIONED SYSTEM COSTS.

01:21:52.774 --> 01:21:53.275
CUSTOMERS THAT DON'T HAVE

01:21:58.146 --> 01:21:58.813
SHIFTING.

01:21:58.880 --> 01:22:00.248
AND THAT'S A MAJOR OMISSION SO

01:22:00.315 --> 01:22:01.850
IF THIS PROVISION RELATING TO

PROVIDED BY THESE RESOURCES.

01:22:18.566 --> 01:22:20.235
THE BILL AS DRAFTED NOW WOULD

01:22:20.302 --> 01:22:21.336
PREVENT THE COMMISSION FROM

01:22:21.403 --> 01:22:22.437
ASSIGNING ANY COST

01:22:22.504 --> 01:22:24.039

ON SITE.

01:22:28.176 --> 01:22:29.077
THIS IS KIND OF A RED FLAG

01:22:29.144 --> 01:22:30.078
BECAUSE THE P. C. HAS BEEN

01:22:30.145 --> 01:22:31.913

01:22:34.849 --> 01:22:35.717
AND WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE

01:22:35.784 --> 01:22:36.885

01:22:36.951 --> 01:22:38.320
THE THIRD REVISION OF THE NET

ENERGY METERING RULES SOMETIME

01:22:40.155 --> 01:22:41.489
LATER THIS YEAR THIS BILL COULD

01:22:41.556 --> 01:22:43.325
HAVE A PROFOUND EFFECT ON THOSE

01:22:43.391 --> 01:22:44.059

ELECTRIC GRID IT'S NOT

01:22:48.663 --> 01:22:49.964
APPROPRIATE TO CATEGORICALLY

01:22:50.031 --> 01:22:51.700
PROHIBIT ANY COSTS FROM BEING

PAY THEIR SHARE OF THESE COSTS --

01:23:13.355 --> 01:23:15.056

01:40:58.352 --> 01:40:59.119
THIS BILL DOES NOTHING TO

01:40:59.186 --> 01:41:00.487
CURTAIL.

01:41:00.554 --> 01:41:02.456
THE ABILITY OF THE P. YOU SEE

01:41:02.523 --> 01:41:03.390
THE REGULATORS THE BOARDS OF

01:41:03.457 --> 01:41:05.492
GOVERNORS THE PIER USE TO CHANGE

01:41:05.559 --> 01:41:06.860
THE RATE FOR EXPORTS.

01:41:06.927 --> 01:41:08.295
IN FACT IT SPECIFICALLY

01:41:08.362 --> 01:41:10.330
ENCOURAGES AND CREATE THE SPACE

01:41:10.397 --> 01:41:11.565
FOR THE UTILITIES TO DO JUST

01:41:11.632 --> 01:41:12.733
THAT IT.

01:41:12.800 --> 01:41:14.935
GIVES DIRECTION TO PROTECT THE

01:41:15.002 --> 01:41:16.904
CONSUMERS ABILITY TO CONSERVE

01:41:16.970 --> 01:41:18.505

THEIR PREMISES WITH THEIR ENERGY

01:41:20.107 --> 01:41:22.709
AND IT ALLOWS THE REGULATOR.

YOU CASE. TO MAKE A

01:41:25.479 --> 01:41:27.247
DETERMINATION ABOUT THE VALUE OF

THE EXPORTED ELECTRICITY IN THIS

01:41:28.348 --> 01:41:30.150
DOES THIS DOES NOTHING TO SET IN

01:41:30.217 --> 01:41:32.052
STONE THE CURRENT FULLY BUNDLED

01:41:32.119 --> 01:41:34.855
RETAIL NAM RATE IN FACT IT

01:41:34.922 --> 01:41:36.023
EXPRESSLY DOES NOT DO THAT.

01:41:36.089 --> 01:41:37.624
SO IT LEAVING THE AUTHORITY

01:41:37.691 --> 01:41:38.859
WHERE IT IS APPROPRIATE WHAT IT

01:41:38.926 --> 01:41:40.227
IS DOING IS ALLOWING THE

01:41:40.294 --> 01:41:42.229
LEGISLATURE TO SPEAK EXACTLY TO

01:41:42.296 --> 01:41:43.530
WHAT WE WANT PEOPLE TO DO TO

01:41:43.597 --> 01:41:44.932
CONSERVE ENERGY TO BE PART OF

01:41:44.998 --> 01:41:46.366
THE SOLUTION FOR CLIMATE CHANGE.

01:41:46.433 --> 01:41:47.668
TO DO SOMETHING WITH THEIR OWN

01:41:47.734 --> 01:41:49.436
INVESTMENT DOLLARS TO PROVIDE A

01:41:49.503 --> 01:41:51.772
RESOURCE THAT CAN PROVIDE VALUE

01:41:51.839 --> 01:41:53.173
TO ALL RATEPAYERS ON THE GRID

01:41:53.240 --> 01:41:55.008
THAT IS WHAT WE ARE DOING WE ARE

01:41:55.075 --> 01:41:56.477
ASKING CUT CUSTOMERS.

01:41:56.543 --> 01:41:58.412
BUSINESSES TO INVEST IN SOLAR

01:41:58.479 --> 01:42:00.414
AND STORAGE WE NEED TO CREATE

01:42:00.481 --> 01:42:01.782
THE MECHANISMS TO ALLOW THAT

01:42:01.849 --> 01:42:03.717
VALUE TO FLOURISH AND SPREAD WE

01:42:03.784 --> 01:42:05.619

ABILITY TO BE PART OF THE

01:42:06.253 --> 01:42:07.120
SOLUTION.

01:42:07.187 --> 01:42:09.957
AND IN FACT WE DON'T DO THAT TO

01:42:10.023 --> 01:42:11.191
PUT CUSTOMERS IN VERY SIMILAR

01:42:11.258 --> 01:42:12.159
SITUATIONS WHEN YOU PUT A HEAT

01:42:12.226 --> 01:42:12.960
PUMP WATER HEATER IN YOUR HOME

01:42:13.026 --> 01:42:14.228
AND YOU HAVE THAT TIED TO THE

01:42:14.294 --> 01:42:15.596
RATE THAT YOU PAY THE TIME OF

01:42:15.662 --> 01:42:16.697
USE RATES.

01:42:16.763 --> 01:42:18.699
WHICH WE HAVE DESIGNED. TO ALIGN

01:42:18.765 --> 01:42:19.967

WHEN YOU PUT AN EFFICIENT

01:42:24.705 --> 01:42:26.173
WINDOWS YOU ARE REDUCING YOUR

01:42:26.240 --> 01:42:28.942
DEMAND ON THE UTILITY WE DO NOT

01:42:29.009 --> 01:42:30.377
REACH INTO PEOPLE'S HOMES AND

01:42:30.444 --> 01:42:32.079
PENALIZE THEM FOR THE?

01:42:32.145 --> 01:42:33.981
ENERGY THAT THEY DID NOT USE AND

01:42:34.047 --> 01:42:34.982
THAT IS THE CORE PRINCIPLE OF

01:42:35.048 --> 01:42:36.950
THIS BILL IT SAYS WE SHOULD NOT

01:42:37.017 --> 01:42:39.186
IMPOSE DISCRIMINATORY FEES OR

01:42:39.253 --> 01:42:40.687
ARBITRARY ACCESS FEES ON SOLAR

01:42:40.754 --> 01:42:41.588

SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY ARE MAKING

01:42:42.923 --> 01:42:44.191
THE RIGHT CHOICE ACCORDING TO

01:42:44.258 --> 01:42:46.727
PUBLIC POLICY IT LEAVES UNTIE

01:42:56.637 --> 01:42:58.038
ADDRESS IT BUT THE FACT IS THAT

01:42:58.105 --> 01:43:00.207
THE BILL DOES NOTHING TO CURTAIL

01:43:00.274 --> 01:43:01.875

DISCRIMINATORY FEES AGAINST THEM

01:43:21.028 --> 01:43:22.429

02:06:44.930 --> 02:06:48.200
I'M NOT SURE THAT WOULD GET VERY

02:06:48.267 --> 02:06:51.070
FAR IN THE LEGISLATURE.

02:06:51.136 --> 02:06:51.737
ARE WE DISAGREE WITH THE I. ESOS

02:06:53.439 --> 02:06:56.075
BY DISCLOSING BASIC INFORMATION.

02:06:56.141 --> 02:06:57.843
ABOUT THAT ABOUT ALL VIOLATIONS

02:06:57.910 --> 02:07:00.279
THAT RESULT IN FINANCIAL

02:07:00.346 --> 02:07:01.080

02:07:01.146 --> 02:07:02.348
WE ALSO BELIEVE IT'S IMPORTANT

02:07:02.414 --> 02:07:04.083
TO PROMOTE TRANSPARENCY BY

THE PUBLIC RECORDS ACT AND THE

BAGLEY KEENE OPEN MEETINGS ACT --

02:07:10.289 --> 02:07:11.457
CURRENT LAW ONLY REQUIRES

02:07:11.523 --> 02:07:13.559
ADHERENCE TO GENERAL POLICIES OF

02:07:13.625 --> 02:07:15.027
THESE ACT AND WE THINK THAT THE

02:07:15.094 --> 02:07:17.363
I ESOS CURRENT POLICIES.

02:07:17.429 --> 02:07:19.365
WHICH ARE WEAKER THAN THOSE THAT

SO TAKEN TOGETHER WE THINK THE

02:07:27.006 --> 02:07:28.140
PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL SHOULD

02:07:28.207 --> 02:07:31.910
