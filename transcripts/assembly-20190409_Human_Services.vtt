WITHOUT A CHILD IN THEIR HOME.

00:58:45.054 --> 00:58:47.423

EVEN IF THEY'RE TRYING TO RETAIN

00:59:02.438 --> 00:59:04.107
CUSTODY OF THEIR CHILDREN HAVING

00:59:04.173 --> 00:59:05.408
ACCESS TO GA WOULD HELP THEM TO

00:59:05.475 --> 00:59:07.477
DO THAT.

00:59:07.543 --> 00:59:08.745

DRAFTING ERROR BUT IN OUR ZEAL.

01:01:33.790 --> 01:01:37.527
YEARS AGO NOT OURS BUT IN THIS.

01:01:37.593 --> 01:01:39.429
ZERO TO CONTROL OR DENY PEOPLE

01:01:39.495 --> 01:01:42.098
BENEFITS ACROSS THE BOARD.

01:01:42.165 --> 01:01:44.133
WE WE CAUSAL A VERY WE CREATE A

01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:45.735
VERY COMPLEX SYSTEM.

01:01:45.802 --> 01:01:47.904
THAT DENIES PEOPLE AND IS WAS

01:01:47.970 --> 01:01:49.505
REALLY SET UP TO DO THAT.

01:01:49.572 --> 01:01:51.107
SO ANY ATTEMPT THAT WE'RE MAKING

01:01:51.174 --> 01:01:54.811
NOW TO KIND OF CHIP AWAY AT THE

01:01:54.877 --> 01:01:56.612
IRRATIONALITY OF THOSE SYSTEMS

01:01:56.679 --> 01:01:58.481
THE THESE ABILITY TO DENY PEOPLE

01:01:58.548 --> 01:02:00.116
THESE BILLION TO SORT OF SET UP

01:02:00.183 --> 01:02:01.484
ALL OF THE HURDLES THAT WE SET

01:02:01.551 --> 01:02:03.052
UP IS REALLY A GOOD THING.

01:02:03.119 --> 01:02:04.687
I WOULD HOPE AT SOME POINT WE

01:02:04.754 --> 01:02:06.789
COULD DO A COMPREHENSIVE LOOK.

01:02:06.856 --> 01:02:08.758
AT WHAT WE WOULD LIKE THE

01:02:08.825 --> 01:02:10.460
ENTITLEMENT SYSTEM TO LOOK LIKE

01:02:10.526 --> 01:02:12.495
VERSUS HOW IT'S BEEN COBBLED

01:02:12.562 --> 01:02:14.730
TOGETHER AS WE SORT OF PEACE

01:02:14.797 --> 01:02:15.798
THESE THINGS TOGETHER THEN WE

01:02:15.865 --> 01:02:17.300
WOULD HAVING A MUCH BETTER IDEA

01:02:17.366 --> 01:02:18.267
OF HOW TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES

01:02:18.334 --> 01:02:19.302
THAT THE COUNTIES HAVE.

01:02:19.368 --> 01:02:20.503
BECAUSE IT'S AN IMPLEMENTATION

01:02:20.570 --> 01:02:23.372
ISSUE ULTIMATELY WE WE DON'T

01:02:23.439 --> 01:02:24.707
WANT TO BE.

01:02:24.774 --> 01:02:25.708
THE NINE PEOPLE ACCESS TO

01:02:25.775 --> 01:02:27.210
BENEFITS THAT REALLY HELP THEM

01:02:27.276 --> 01:02:28.778
GET OUT OF POVERTY THAT THAT THE

01:02:28.845 --> 01:02:30.413
SYSTEM IN THE COMMUNITIES.

01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:32.815
WE GET OUR SYSTEM DOES THAT.

01:02:32.882 --> 01:02:33.716
BECAUSE OF OUR YOU COULD

01:02:33.783 --> 01:02:35.852
CYNICALLY SAY WAS INTENTIONAL

01:02:35.918 --> 01:02:36.686
BUT I THINK IT WAS THAT A LOT OF

01:02:36.752 --> 01:02:39.288
WAYS. TO DENY ACCESS TO IT A

01:02:39.355 --> 01:02:40.990
NUMBER OF FOLKS SO IT'S GOOD

01:02:41.057 --> 01:02:42.158
THAT WE'RE WORKING AT THIS BUT I

01:02:42.225 --> 01:02:43.426

01:02:43.493 --> 01:02:44.594
WE'RE JUST SORT OF LOOKING AT

01:02:44.660 --> 01:02:46.863

SOME BILLS IN THIS AREA AS WELL.

01:02:48.164 --> 01:02:49.198
BUT I THINK WE SHOULD LOOK MORE

01:02:49.265 --> 01:02:51.634
COMPREHENSIVELY AT SOME POINT AT

01:02:51.701 --> 01:02:53.236
THE OVERALL SYSTEM AND MAKE SURE

01:02:53.302 --> 01:02:56.038
THAT IT'S RATIONAL AND THAT

01:18:43.819 --> 01:18:45.454

AND THEN IN DIDN'T MISS CAL WAYS

01:18:47.589 --> 01:18:50.358
OF SITUATION WHEN THAT HAPPENED.

01:18:50.425 --> 01:18:51.626

01:18:59.634 --> 01:19:00.902
THAT BEING SAID.

01:19:00.969 --> 01:19:02.571
WE HAD A TOWN HALL AND BRENT

01:19:02.637 --> 01:19:03.672
WOULD I BELIEVE IT WAS ABOUT

01:19:03.738 --> 01:19:05.273
THREE WEEKS AGO AND WAS VERY

01:19:05.340 --> 01:19:07.275
KIND OF THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR

01:19:07.342 --> 01:19:08.410

01:19:13.782 --> 01:19:15.150
PEOPLE.

01:19:15.217 --> 01:19:16.885
AND IT WAS STANDING ROOM ONLY.

01:19:16.952 --> 01:19:17.853
BECAUSE THESE PEOPLE WERE

01:19:17.919 --> 01:19:20.489
THIRSTY FOR INFORMATION ON HOW.

01:19:20.555 --> 01:19:22.023
THEY COULD ACTUALLY BE SERVED BY

THE REGIONAL CENTER.

01:19:23.325 --> 01:19:25.327
THAT BEING SAID.

01:19:37.873 --> 01:19:39.574

01:19:39.641 --> 01:19:41.543
THEY HAVE AN ABILITY TO GO TO A

01:19:41.610 --> 01:19:43.945
DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCESS IF

THEN THE MOST VULNERABLE THE

01:22:37.652 --> 01:22:38.753
LEAST.

01:22:38.820 --> 01:22:44.559
ABLE TO WITHSTAND IT -- THE THE

01:22:44.626 --> 01:22:46.328
DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES SYSTEM AS

01:22:46.394 --> 01:22:48.129
WE KNOW SERVICE OVER THREE

01:22:48.196 --> 01:22:49.497
HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND

01:22:49.564 --> 01:22:50.532
INDIVIDUALS.

01:22:50.598 --> 01:22:53.902
EACH OF WHOM HAS VARYING NEEDS.

01:22:53.968 --> 01:22:56.037
WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT WE ALL

01:22:56.104 --> 01:22:57.772
RECOGNIZE THAT HOW IMPORTANT IT

01:22:57.839 --> 01:23:00.241
IS THAT THOSE NEEDS BE MET.

01:23:00.308 --> 01:23:01.576
AND THAT THERE IS RECOURSE WHEN

01:23:01.643 --> 01:23:03.411
THEY ARE NOT.

01:23:03.478 --> 01:23:05.280
CLEARLY WE HAVE EXAMPLES WHERE

01:23:05.347 --> 01:23:06.614
THEY HAVE NOT BEEN MET.

01:23:06.681 --> 01:23:08.383
WE'VE HEARD A LOT TODAY ABOUT

01:23:08.450 --> 01:23:10.018
THE NEED FOR TRANSPARENCY AND

01:23:10.085 --> 01:23:11.653
OVERSIGHT.

01:23:11.720 --> 01:23:13.788
AND I COULDN'T AGREE MORE.

01:23:13.855 --> 01:23:16.791
I BELIEVE THAT WE NEED TO DO

01:23:16.858 --> 01:23:19.394
MORE TO ENSURE THAT THE REGIONAL

01:23:19.461 --> 01:23:22.197
CENTER CONSUMERS HAVE RECOURSE

01:23:22.263 --> 01:23:24.933
WHEN SERVICES ARE DENIED.

01:23:24.999 --> 01:23:25.834
OR WHEN THERE'S A DISAGREEMENT

01:23:25.900 --> 01:23:27.469
ABOUT A DECISION REGARDING THE

01:23:27.535 --> 01:23:29.404
SERVICE.

01:23:29.471 --> 01:23:30.705
BUT I ALSO WANT TO BE SURE THAT

01:23:30.772 --> 01:23:33.641
THE PROCESS THAT WE PUT IN PLACE.

01:23:33.708 --> 01:23:37.178

RIGHT ORGANIZER FOR PARENT

02:26:46.697 --> 02:26:49.233
VOICES -- WE JUST TRULY BELIEVE

02:26:49.300 --> 02:26:50.535
THAT THE WELL BEING OF CHILDREN

02:26:50.601 --> 02:26:52.403
IS INTRINSICALLY LINKED TO THE

02:26:52.470 --> 02:26:55.606
WELL BEING OF THEIR PARENTS--

02:26:55.673 --> 02:26:56.507
FOR TWENTY THREE YEARS NOW WE'VE

02:26:56.574 --> 02:26:58.075
BEEN BRINGING MOTHERS WHO ARE ON

02:26:58.142 --> 02:26:59.810
THE WAITING LIST TO THE CAPITAL

02:26:59.877 --> 02:27:01.179
TO SHARE THEIR STORIES THEY POUR

02:27:01.245 --> 02:27:03.114
THEIR HEART OUT THEY DESCRIBE

02:27:03.181 --> 02:27:04.448
THE CHALLENGES OF THE SACRIFICES.

02:27:04.515 --> 02:27:05.783
AND YET YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTER

02:27:05.850 --> 02:27:07.685
YEAR ON THERE HASN'T BEEN ENOUGH

02:27:07.752 --> 02:27:08.986
SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT IN THIS

02:27:09.053 --> 02:27:10.188
PROGRAM.

02:27:10.254 --> 02:27:11.556
I WANT TO THANK THE ASSEMBLY

02:27:11.622 --> 02:27:12.356
WOMAN FOR REALLY SHEDDING A

02:27:12.423 --> 02:27:14.525
LIGHT ON THIS CRISIS IN USING

02:27:14.592 --> 02:27:15.927
HER PLATFORM.

02:27:15.993 --> 02:27:18.296
TO BE ABLE TO BRING THE STORIES

02:27:18.362 --> 02:27:18.930
TO LIFE.

02:27:18.996 --> 02:27:20.097
THE BEAUTY OF THIS BILL IS THAT

02:27:20.164 --> 02:27:21.766
IT'S ACTUALLY WHAT PARENTS WANT

02:27:21.832 --> 02:27:23.334
AND NEED.

02:27:23.401 --> 02:27:25.570
THIS BILL TAKES US AWAY

02:27:25.636 --> 02:27:27.104
OFTENTIMES IN THIS BUILDING WE

02:27:27.171 --> 02:27:29.340
ARE TARGET POLICIES TOWARDS AGE

02:27:29.407 --> 02:27:30.775
GROUP OR WE TARGET POLICIES BY

02:27:30.841 --> 02:27:31.842
SAUDI.

02:27:31.909 --> 02:27:33.411
AND THAT'S NOT HOW FAMILIES

02:27:33.477 --> 02:27:36.047
OPERATE -- WE NEED CARE FOR OUR

02:27:36.113 --> 02:27:38.482
CHILDREN FROM BIRTH ONWARDS --

02:27:38.549 --> 02:27:40.151
WE CAN'T PICK AND CHOOSE WHICH

02:27:40.218 --> 02:27:42.186
CHILD GETS CARE ON BECAUSE WE'RE

02:27:42.253 --> 02:27:43.554
ALWAYS GOING TO HAVE TO BE THE

02:27:43.621 --> 02:27:44.121
ONE THAT STAYS HOME WITH THE

02:27:44.188 --> 02:27:45.590
OTHER ONE RIGHT WE WE THE WHOLE

02:27:45.656 --> 02:27:46.791
FAMILY.

02:27:46.857 --> 02:27:48.292
NEEDS TO PROGRESS FORWARD AND

02:27:48.359 --> 02:27:50.394
THE OTHER TRUTH IS THAT FAMILIES

02:27:50.461 --> 02:27:52.396
USE ALL TYPE OF SETTINGS AT ALL

02:27:52.463 --> 02:27:53.764
DIFFERENT POINTS IN THEIR

02:27:53.831 --> 02:27:55.433
CHILD'S LIFE I'VE USED FAMILY

02:27:55.499 --> 02:27:56.901
FRIEND AND NEIGHBOR CARE FAMILY

02:27:56.968 --> 02:27:59.036
CHILDCARE CENTER BASED CARE.

02:27:59.103 --> 02:28:00.771
AND WAS BASED ON MY CHILD'S

02:28:00.838 --> 02:28:02.506
NEEDS AT THAT PARTICULAR MOMENT

02:28:02.573 --> 02:28:04.909
AND SO WE DON'T NEED A ONE SIZE

02:28:04.976 --> 02:28:06.244
FITS ALL APPROACH WE NEED A

02:28:06.310 --> 02:28:08.012
COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH AND AND

02:28:08.079 --> 02:28:09.847
THIS BILL REALLY ALLOWS FAMILIES

02:28:09.914 --> 02:28:11.182
TO MAKE CHOICES.

02:28:11.249 --> 02:28:12.450
THEY HAVE NO CONTROL OVER THEIR

02:28:12.516 --> 02:28:14.552
SCHEDULE THEY DON'T HAVE CONTROL

02:28:14.619 --> 02:28:15.786
OVER A LOT OF THINGS IN LIFE.

02:28:15.853 --> 02:28:17.722
FLEXIBLE CHILDCARE OPTIONS GIVE

02:28:17.788 --> 02:28:19.490
THEM THAT ONE SENSE OF CONTROL

02:28:19.557 --> 02:28:21.492
TO CHOOSE WHAT WORKS BEST FOR

02:28:21.559 --> 02:28:22.927
THEM AND THAT'S WHY THEY NEED

02:28:22.994 --> 02:28:25.396
THAT FLEXIBILITY -- YOU KNOW

02:28:25.463 --> 02:28:26.864
IT'S ALSO I WAS THINKING ABOUT

02:28:26.931 --> 02:28:29.467
IT IN HEALTHCARE WE DON'T --

02:28:29.533 --> 02:28:30.067
PROVIDE HEALTH CARE TO JUST

02:28:30.134 --> 02:28:31.802
BABIES FOR PROVIDE HEALTH CARE

02:28:31.869 --> 02:28:33.170
TO JUST FOUR YEAR OLDS OR HEALTH

02:28:33.237 --> 02:28:34.739
CARE TO JUST SCHOOL AGE KIDS WE

02:28:34.805 --> 02:28:35.539
PROVIDE HEALTH CARE TO THE WHOLE

02:28:35.606 --> 02:28:36.440
FAMILY.

02:28:36.507 --> 02:28:37.575
AND WE NEED TO APPLY THAT SAME

02:28:37.642 --> 02:28:40.478
THING -- TO CHILDCARE WE ALSO

02:28:40.544 --> 02:28:43.314
BELIEVE THIS IS A RACIAL GENDER

02:28:43.381 --> 02:28:46.284
AND ECONOMIC JUSTICE BILL 86% OF

02:28:46.350 --> 02:28:47.485

LAST NIGHT SLEEPING IN CARS

02:28:52.156 --> 02:28:54.292
BECAUSE THEY CAN'T GET TO WORK

02:28:54.358 --> 02:28:55.626
THEY CAN'T PAY FOR CHILDCARE AND

02:28:55.693 --> 02:28:56.894
THERE THEY ARE HOMELESS AND SO

02:28:56.961 --> 02:28:58.496

EXPLAINED VERY COMPLICATED --

02:52:30.339 --> 02:52:31.574
PROPOSAL THE OF A WONDERFUL

02:52:31.641 --> 02:52:33.609
COMMITTEE ANALYSIS ON THIS

02:52:33.676 --> 02:52:34.777
SINGLE REGIONALI STATE

02:52:34.844 --> 02:52:35.845
REIMBURSEMENT SYSTEM FOR EARLY

02:52:35.912 --> 02:52:38.147
CARE WOULD HELP ENSURE THAT THE

02:52:38.214 --> 02:52:40.116
EARLY THE MIX DELIVERY SYSTEM IS

02:52:40.183 --> 02:52:42.051
MAINTAINED -- AND INCLUDING ITS

02:52:42.118 --> 02:52:46.823
VARIOUS PROGRAM MISSIONS WHICH

02:52:46.889 --> 02:53:03.973
HAVE BEEN -- CAN YOU.

02:53:04.040 --> 02:53:04.607
DID YOU TO ACHIEVE THE VARIOUS

02:53:04.674 --> 02:53:06.075
PROGRAM MISSIONS WE HAVE THAT

02:53:06.142 --> 02:53:07.110
NEED TO BE FUNDED ADEQUATELY IN

02:53:07.176 --> 02:53:07.910
ORDER TO ACHIEVE THEIR MISSIONS

02:53:07.977 --> 02:53:08.444
AND THEIR SHARED MISSION.

02:53:08.511 --> 02:53:09.712
OF SUPPORTING WORKING FAMILIES

02:53:09.779 --> 02:53:10.713
AND THRIVING CHILDREN.

02:53:10.780 --> 02:53:11.914
I MEAN SIGNIFICANTLY WE BELIEVE

02:53:11.981 --> 02:53:12.515
THAT LIKE WITH OUR OB LOCAL

02:53:12.582 --> 02:53:13.516
CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA THAT WE

02:53:13.583 --> 02:53:15.618
HAVE FOR OUR K. TWELVE SYSTEM WE

02:53:15.685 --> 02:53:16.753
CAN HAVE A FORMULA FOR CHILD

02:53:16.819 --> 02:53:18.921
CARE FUNDING THAT IS A DRIVER

02:53:18.988 --> 02:53:20.523
FOR THE CHILD AND THE SYSTEM

02:53:20.590 --> 02:53:21.657
OUTCOMES THAT WE WANT TO RATHER

02:53:21.724 --> 02:53:22.558
THAN THIS KIND BIFURCATED.

02:53:22.625 --> 02:53:24.360
MESS THAT WE HAVE SO THE FIRST

02:53:24.427 --> 02:53:25.695
GRAPHIC SHOWS YOU THE BIFURCATED

02:53:25.762 --> 02:53:26.963
SYSTEM.

02:53:27.029 --> 02:53:28.030
THE SECOND GRAPHIC IS A

02:53:28.097 --> 02:53:29.799
DEPICTION OF THE CONCEPT WHICH

02:53:29.866 --> 02:53:31.334
IS QUITE SIMPLY.

02:53:31.400 --> 02:53:33.069
TAKING A REVISED REGIONAL MARKET

02:53:33.136 --> 02:53:35.037
RATE SYSTEM IN TRYING TO CORRECT

02:53:35.104 --> 02:53:36.506
SOME THE MARKET FAILURES THEY'RE

02:53:36.572 --> 02:53:38.741
BUILT INTO THE SYSTEM.

02:53:38.808 --> 02:53:40.576
AND THEN ADDING ON TO IT --

02:53:40.643 --> 02:53:42.245
EIGHT QUALITY ADJUSTMENT FACTOR

02:53:42.311 --> 02:53:43.479
FOR THOSE PROGRAMS THAT ARE

02:53:43.546 --> 02:53:45.848
ASKED TO MEET HIGHER STANDARDS

02:53:45.915 --> 02:53:47.884
AND REQUIREMENTS -- MOST LARGELY

02:53:47.950 --> 02:53:49.519
IN TERMS OF DRIVING THEIR COSTS

02:53:49.585 --> 02:53:50.920
IS THE CHANGE IN THE CHILD ADULT

02:53:50.987 --> 02:53:51.754
RATIO.

02:53:51.821 --> 02:53:53.189
SO -- WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS

02:53:53.256 --> 02:53:55.158
THOSE ISSUES WHILE AT THE SAME

02:53:55.224 --> 02:53:58.194
TIME ALSO -- CREATING A THE

02:53:58.261 --> 02:54:00.530
ABILITY -- FOR INCENTIVES FOR

02:54:00.596 --> 02:54:02.698
TELL TWENTY TWO PROGRAMS TO ALSO

02:54:02.765 --> 02:54:03.900
MEET TITLE FIVE STANDARDS IF

02:54:03.966 --> 02:54:05.334
THEY CHOOSE TO DO SO WE WILL SEE

02:54:05.401 --> 02:54:06.969
THAT THE BILL ALSO CONTAINS A

02:54:07.036 --> 02:54:10.206
PILOT. FOR THAT RECOMMENDATION.

02:54:10.273 --> 02:54:11.607
SO THE THIRD GRAPHIC YOU HAVE

02:54:11.674 --> 02:54:13.543
THEN EXPLAINS IMPLEMENTATION

02:54:13.609 --> 02:54:15.077
DESIGN OF OUR PROPOSAL.

02:54:15.144 --> 02:54:16.746
RATHER THAN TO EXPECT THE STATE

02:54:16.813 --> 02:54:18.414
TO ABSORB ALL THE COSTS OF THIS

02:54:18.481 --> 02:54:20.116
ALIGNMENT IN ONE YEAR LIKE WITH

02:54:20.183 --> 02:54:21.317
THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING

02:54:21.384 --> 02:54:23.085
FORMULA IT'S A METHODOLOGYFOR

02:54:23.152 --> 02:54:25.288
HAVING THE STATE CREEK TARGETS

02:54:25.354 --> 02:54:26.556
FOR REACHING THIS NEW SINGLE

02:54:26.622 --> 02:54:27.456
RATE SYSTEM.

02:54:27.523 --> 02:54:28.658
AND THEN OVER TIME IN EACH

02:54:28.724 --> 02:54:29.926
BUDGET ACT THE LEGISLATURE AND

02:54:29.992 --> 02:54:31.427
GOVERNOR WILL BE ABLE TO DECIDE

02:54:31.494 --> 02:54:32.328
HOW MUCH MONEY THEY HAVE TO

02:54:32.395 --> 02:54:33.863
CONTRIBUTE TOWARDS THESE NEW

02:54:33.930 --> 02:54:34.530
TARGETS.

02:54:34.597 --> 02:54:36.532
SO -- WE BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A

02:54:36.599 --> 02:54:39.335
VERY PRUDENT BUT CRUCIAL CHANGE

02:54:39.402 --> 02:54:40.303
THE DRIVER IN OUR HEALTHCARE

02:54:40.369 --> 02:54:41.804
SYSTEM OUR FUNDING.

02:54:41.871 --> 02:54:46.309
AND WE WOULD ASK FOR YOUR

02:54:46.375 --> 02:54:48.978
SUPPORT THANK YOU.

02:54:49.045 --> 02:54:49.712
HAVE A QUESTION ON YOUR LAST

02:54:49.779 --> 02:54:50.580
CHART.

02:54:50.646 --> 02:54:51.447
YES THIS IS THE AMOUNT THE

02:54:51.514 --> 02:54:52.915
COUNTY WOULD HAVE TO PAY.

02:54:52.982 --> 02:54:54.684
NO THIS IS THE AMOUNT THAT THE

02:54:54.750 --> 02:54:57.019
STATE WOULD PAY TO THE TO THE

02:54:57.086 --> 02:54:59.021
CONTRACTORS HER PROVIDING CHILD

02:54:59.088 --> 02:54:59.388
CARE SERVICES.

02:54:59.455 --> 02:55:04.026
SO SAN FRANCISCO WOULD RECEIVE.

02:55:04.093 --> 02:55:04.527
ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND SAN

02:55:04.594 --> 02:55:07.663
BERNADINE -- ABOUT SIXTY FIVE

02:55:07.730 --> 02:55:08.497
THOUSAND AND THAT HAS TO DO WITH

02:55:08.564 --> 02:55:11.400
THE COSTS OF THE MARKET SO WHAT

02:55:11.467 --> 02:55:13.402
THIS PROPOSAL IS BASED ON IS

02:55:13.469 --> 02:55:14.904
USING THE REGIONAL MARKET RATE

02:55:14.971 --> 02:55:17.039
SURVEY WHICH IS CONDUCTED.

02:55:17.106 --> 02:55:18.674
EVERY TWO YEARS.

02:55:18.741 --> 02:55:20.877
AND IT ASSESSES THE COST OF

02:55:20.943 --> 02:55:23.512
DOING BUSINESS IN ANY GIVEN AREA.

02:55:23.579 --> 02:55:25.014
SO YOU'RE HIGHER COST

02:55:25.081 --> 02:55:27.416
COMMUNITIES RIGHT NOW ALL ARE

02:55:27.483 --> 02:55:31.153
NOT COMPENSATED BASED ON THAT SO

02:55:31.220 --> 02:55:34.190
THIS WITH A JUST FOR THAT.

02:55:34.257 --> 02:55:35.725
SO EVERYBODY GETS AN INCREASE

02:55:35.791 --> 02:55:37.293
BUT THE HIGH COST COUNTIES

02:55:37.360 --> 02:55:40.763
INCREASE ESCALATES A BIT MORE.

02:55:40.830 --> 02:55:42.164
