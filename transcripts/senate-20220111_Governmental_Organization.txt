I LET ME START BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS REFLECTED ANALYSIS I ALSO WANT TO THANK YOU MR CHAIR AND THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR YOUR DEDICATED WORK ON THIS ISSUE OVER THE LAST YEAR- FOLKS I WILL REMEMBER THAT WE'VE HAD THIS BILL IN PRINT FOR. ASSISTANCE THE BEGINNING OF LAST YEAR WE HAD A GREAT- SESSION ON THIS- HEARING OVER THE INTERIM. YOU KNOW ONE SILVER LINING OF THIS TERRIBLE PANDEMIC HAS BEEN THE DEVELOPMENT OF SOME CREATIVE POLICY IDEA SPURRED BY THE NEED TO ADJUST TO LIFE. UNDER COVERAGE RESTRICTIONS. AT TEN STATES AND THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA ALLOW JUST DIRECT TO CONSUMER SHIPPING FOR FEAR AND DISTILLED SPIRITS. DURING THE COPA NINETEEN PANDEMIC ADDITIONAL STATES ALLOWED ALCOHOL PRODUCERS TO SHIP. DIRECTLY TO CONSUMERS AS A TEMPORARY ECONOMIC RELIEF MEASURE. IN MARCH OF TWENTY TWENTY GOVERNOR NEWSOM DIRECTED A DIFFERENT ALCOHOL BEVERAGE CONTROL TO ALLOW DIRECT TO CONSUMER SHIPPING OF DISTILLED SPIRITS THIS IS ONE OF SEVERAL POLICIES PUT IN PLACE TO RESPOND TO CONSUMER DEMAND. IN THE SOCIALLY DISTANT ECONOMY AND IT WAS EXTENDED THROUGH THE END OF MARCH TWENTY TWENTY TWO JUST BEFORE. THE NEW YEAR. THEY HAD THE STATE NOT INTERVENED. I AM ALLOWED FOR THE TEMPORARY ABILITY FOR DIRECT TO CONSUMER SHIPPING OF DISTILLED SPIRITS MANY LOCAL DISTILLERIES MAY HAVE BEEN FORCED TO SHUT DOWN. EMILY AND WE ALL HAVE THESE SMALL DISTILLERIES IN OUR DISTRICTS. WITH THIS BILL WE GOT AN OPPORTUNITY TO SUPPORT THESE CALIFORNIA BUSINESS BY CREATING A BETTER SYSTEM ALL WHILE INCREASING ACCESS CONVENIENCE AND SAFETY FOR CONSUME FOR CUSTOMERS. ALREADY UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW BOTH IN STATE AND OUT OF STATE WINE GROWERS ARE AUTHORIZED TO SELL AND SHIP WINE DIRECTLY TO CONSUMERS. WE'VE SEEN THE DIRECT TO CONSUMER MODEL WORK EFFECTIVELY IN THE WINE MARKET OTHER STATES IN CALIFORNIA THROUGHOUT THE PANDEMIC AND WE KNOW IT'S WHAT. CONSUMERS WANT. I SHOULD MENTION I'M WORKING WITH LABOR WITH THE FOLKS OUR FRIENDS FROM THE TEAMSTERS TO ADDRESS THEIR CONCERNS COME TO A COMPROMISE JUST HAD A GREAT MEETING WITH THEM YESTERDAY- ULTIMATELY THIS IS ABOUT. ENSURING THAT THE BILL SUPPORTS CONSUMER ACCESS GROWING CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES AND JOBS ACROSS THE STATE. HERE WITH ME TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF OUR QUESTS WALKER THE CEO OF DISCUS ALEX.

FOR THE RECORD GIVES GETS FULLY SUPPORTS OUR WHOLESALE AND RETAIL PARTNERS. THEY ARE THE CORNERSTONES OF RESPONSIBLE IN A FLOURISHING BEVERAGE ALCOHOL MARKET WE DO BELIEVE HOWEVER THE THREE TIER SYSTEM SHOULD MODERNIZED TO REFLECT THE NEW MARKET MARKET PLACE.

ANY LEGISLATION THAT SHOULD REFLECT DIFFICULT CORRECTABLE HE HAD PRIVILEGE PREVIOUSLY SHARED WITH THE COMMITTEE INCLUDING A RESPONSIBLE BODY ELECTRIC SHIPPING ONE. THESE PRINCIPLES WILL HELP ENSURE THAT ANY DIRECTOR CONSUMER SHIPPING LEGISLATION DID NOT LEAD TO UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. THAT COMPROMISE THE INTEGRITY OF RESPONSIBLE DISTRIBUTION OF BEVERAGE ALCOHOL THERE ARE THREE POINTS. WORK DID- DETAIL. IF THE DOOR SHIP AND SO TO THE LAW RAMP SMALL PRODUCE THAT WITH ESTABLISHED WHOLESALERS WITH MORE THAN TWO. THREE HUNDRED CRAFT DISTILLERS ACROSS THE UNITED STATES.

NATIONAL DISTRIBUTING FORMALLY YOUNG'S MARKET COMPANY HERE IN CALIFORNIA FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE YEARS WE'VE MADE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS OPEN FACILITIES THAN JOBS OVER THAT PERIOD OF TIME AND IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE TEAMSTERS UNION THAT JUST TESTIFIED. I THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS. THE REAL QUESTION POSED BY THE BILL HASN'T BEEN FULLY DISCUSS. THE QUESTION IS THIS BILL INTENDED TO HELP SMALL CRAFT DISTILLERS. FOR THAT INTENDED TO HELP LARGE CORPORATE CALIFORNIA BUT THE QUESTION PRESENTED BY THIS BILL- I WOULD TELL YOU THAT WE WOULD SUPPORT MOST OF THE COMMENTS MADE BY THE CRAFT DISTILLERS IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. THEY IN FACT WE ARE SENSITIVE TO THEIR CONCERNS THEY WERE IMPACTED BY KOGAN AND WE WANT TO HELP THEM. UNFORTUNATELY THE BILL IN HELPING THEM ALSO HELP. LARGE OUT OF STATE THE SOLAR CORPORATIONS WITH SIGNIFICANT MARKETING POWER AND THAT. SOMETHING THAT WE JUST CAN'T SUPPORT. WE ARE SUPPORTIVE OF HELPING CRAFT DISTILLERS AND CREATING A VOLUME LIMITATION THE BALL OUT OF. BEEN CRAVING THAT IN OVERTIME SO THAT THE INDUSTRY IS ITSELF. AND GRAPPLE WITH THIS CHANGE AND HAVE IT HAPPEN SEAMLESSLY AND SMOKE. HOWEVER THIS BILL DOESN'T DO THAT. IN THE LAST THING I WOULD CLOSE WITHIN THE CONCEPT THAT CONSUMERS NEED ADDITIONAL CHOICE RIGHT NOW NOT ONLY AT STORES. BUT ONLINE THE BIG ALLOCATE THE SELLERS COULD IN FACT SELL THEIR PRODUCTS ONLINE. WHAT TO DO ONLINE TRIED TO DO THAT RIGHT NOW THE KEY THING IS THAT THOSE ONLINE SITES USE LICENSE WHOLESALERS AND RETAILERS IN CALIFORNIA TO FULFILL THOSE REQUESTS. BOTH THE FALSE NARRATIVE THAT SOMEHOW. SUMER IS CAN'T FIND WHAT THEY WANT ONLINE IS JUST NOT TRUE THIS FLY YOU GOTTA CLOSE THE CABLE BILL BUT- ALL RIGHT I WOULD JUST CLOSE WITH SAYING THAT WE SUPPORT THE CRAFT DISTILLERS. WE'D LIKE TO HELP THEM IN A BILL THAT WOULD SUPPORT THEM HELP THEM. AND WE'RE ALSO SUPPORTED THE WHAT THE CRAFT BREWERS WANT TO DO IN TERMS OF LEGAL CLARIFICATION. THE PROBLEM WITH THIS BILL DOES A LOT MORE THAN THAT AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE PROS. THANK YOU FINALLY WE HAVE DENNIS LOPER ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA BEER AND BEVERAGE DISTRIBUTORS. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN DOUGLAS FLINT BURNED OFFICE CVD. LIKE THE LITTLE SPOKEN ALREADY HE REPEATED HIS OPPOSITION CONCERNED ABOUT THE LOSS OF GOOD PAYING JOBS.

THANK YOU VERY VERY MUCH I APPRECIATE THE- OPPOSITION WITNESSES- WE'RE GONNA BRING THIS NOW BACK- TO OUR MEMBERSHIP. ANY MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE WISHING- TO ADDRESS US FOR THIS BOARD US SENATOR RUBIO SATTAR MIKE UP. THANK YOU MR CHAIR. WELL FIRST OF ALL I WANNA THANK EVERYONE THAT CALLED IN TODAY- FIRST OF I WANT TO START BY ACKNOWLEDGING ALL THE CONCERNS OF BY ALL THE TEAMSTERS ARE CALLED IN BUT ALSO THE SMALL BUSINESSES AND I THINK THERE'S A REAL CONCERN THERE AND SOMETHING THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO WORK ON BUT I ALSO WANT TO BE MINDFUL AND THANKFUL THAT THE AUTHOR HAS DEDICATED SO MUCH TIME AT LEAST WITH ME WITH HAVING CONVERSATIONS THROUGHOUT THE WEEK AND- AND EVEN IN PREVIOUS TIMES AND- HE HAS AGREED TO CONTINUE THIS CONVERSATION- IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT THERE IS A LOT OF DEFICIENCIES. A STATUS AND SO I WANNA MAKE SURE THAT YOU KNOW I LEASED IT FOR THE RECORD THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE ISSUES FACING THE TEAMSTERS SMALL BUSINESSES DEFINITIONS AND THERE'S A LOT A LIST OF OTHER ITEMS THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS BUT TODAY I WILL SUPPORT IT WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT THIS CONVERSATION WILL NOT STOP HERE AND THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS BUT AGAIN I WANT TO COMMEND THE AUTHOR BECAUSE THAT'S BEEN HIS COMMITMENT AND I KNOW THAT HE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS. AND WHAT THAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR CENTER COME UNDER. THANK YOU MR CHAIR- I. TWO. I WANT TO ECHO THE- SENTIMENTS OF MINE COLLEAGUE FROM ORLAND PARK BEHIND THIS BILL I'VE HAD- GOOD DISCUSSIONS WITH THE AUTHOR OF THIS BILL. AND I ALSO HAVE TO SAY I HAVE FAITH IN THE AUTHOR. THAT HE WILL DO ALL THAT HE CAN- TO WORK THIS OUT. HE HAS PROVEN TO BE THAT KIND OF CHAMPION- FOR OTHER ISSUES AND SO I CERTAINLY DON'T THINK THAT HE WILL NOT- GIVE THE SAME KIND OF ATTENTION TO THIS ISSUE. I'VE HEARD THAT THERE WERE CONSTRUCTIVE DISCUSSIONS EVEN THIS MORNING WITH THE OPPOSITION AND I DO BELIEVE THAT- THINGS WILL GET WORKED OUT. YOU KNOW I YOU WOULD THINK I WOULD HAVE KNOWN MORE ABOUT THIS ISSUE BECAUSE I CERTAINLY INVITES. ARE BUT- I DON'T KNOW THAT MUCH ABOUT THIS ISSUE I DID READ THE LANGUAGE AND I READ THE ANALYSIS AND I READ MANY OF THE SUPPORT LETTERS AND LISTENED OBVIOUSLY TO THE FOLKS WHO CALLED IN ON BOTH SIDES. AND A FEW THOUGHTS WERE RAISED- THAT THE LANGUAGE ACTUALLY DOESN'T DISCRIMINATE BETWEEN LARGE AND SMALL DISTILLERIES WHICH IN MY MIND MEANS THAT SMALL DISTILLERIES- WILL LOSE OUT I MEAN JUST BECAUSE OF. YOU KNOW WHO HAS A GREATER SHARE OF THE MARKET WHO HAS MORE CAPACITY MORE CAPITAL GREATER INFRASTRUCTURE I THINK WE OWE IT TO OURSELVES TO TRY TO LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE TO OUR SMALL AND FAMILY RUN IN CALIFORNIA DISTILLERIES. EVEN THOUGH I KNOW THERE ARE SOME ISSUES BETWEEN IN STATE OUT OF STATE AND HOW YOU CAN'T DISCRIMINATE- AT THE END OF THE DAY IT SEEMS TO ME FROM WHAT I'VE READ THAT DISTRIBUTORS ACTUALLY. DON'T SEEM TO WANT TO WORK WITH SMALL DISTILLERIES BECAUSE IT PROBABLY DOESN'T PENCIL OUT. IN YOU KNOW MY RESPONSE IS SHAME ON THEM- I THINK WE OWE IT TO. OUR CRAFT DISTILLERIES ESPECIALLY THOSE- HERE IN CALIFORNIA TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO INCENTIVIZE OR ENCOURAGE DISTRIBUTORS TO WORK WITH THEM SO THAT WE CAN LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD SO THAT CONSUMERS HAVE. ALL OPTIONS AT THEIR DISPOSAL TO BE SUPPORTIVE% OF SOME OF THE GREAT PRODUCTS THAT ARE COMING OUT OF THE STATE IN THAT ARE COMING FROM OUR SMALL CRAFT DISTILLERIES. N. YOU KNOW WE HEARD FROM FOLKS ON WHO SUPPORT THE BILL THAT THIS WILL CREATE JOBS BUT WE ALSO HEARD FROM FOLKS IN OPPOSITION. THAT DOGS WILL BE LOST AND I DO THINK WE OWE IT TO BOTH SIDES TO KIND OF FIGURE OUT WHAT THE COMPROMISES. BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE DON'T WANT MORE JOBS TO DISAPPEAR AND WE DON'T WANT. JOBS THAT ARE GOOD THAT DON'T HAVE BENEFITS THAT DON'T ALLOW FOLKS TO RAISE THEIR FAMILIES AND CARE FOR THEIR FAMILIES. WE DON'T WANT THOSE KINDS OF JOBS TO BE LOST. SO I AM RESPECTFULLY GONNA. LAY OFF AT THIS TIME BECAUSE I KNOW THAT THIS WILL GET OUT AND I WANT THE DISCUSSIONS TO CONTINUE. AND I INTEND TO BE ABLE TO VOTE ON A BILL WHEN IT COMES UP FOR ME AGAIN BECAUSE I AS I MENTIONED AT THE BEGINNING HAVE FAITH. IN THIS AUTHOR- THAT HE I GOING TO DO WHAT I THINK HE'S ALREADY TRYING TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO DO BUT IT WAS PROBABLY JUST TIMING. FOR WHEN THIS BILL WAS BEING HEARD. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER MEMBERS- CENTER THE BARGES PLEASE. SHARE EDUCATION A CHAT WITH THE AUTHOR AND I GOTTA TELL YA I HOLD THE AUTHOR IN THE HIGHEST ESTEEM ARE BECAUSE HE'S A VERY THOUGHTFUL HAS A HISTORY OF WORKING WITH FOLKS AND- TRYING TO FIGURE OUT PASS FORWARD I THINK WE'RE LOOKING AT A BILL THAT HAS SOME UNEXPECTED COMPLEXITY AND CERTAINLY- DIVISION OF SPECIAL. INTERESTS BEING FROM FRESNO- NO DOUBT WE HAVE A STRONG DISTRIBUTION NETWORK SYSTEM IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY- ONE THAT I THINK HAS BEEN ESSENTIAL TO OUR ECONOMIC PROSPERITY- BUT REVIEWING THIS MATTER I THINK WE CAN ALL APPRECIATE THAT THE THREE TIERED SYSTEM. IS A LITTLE ARCHAIC AND IT NEEDS TO BE REVIEWED AND LOOKED AFTER- INTO WHAT IT'S LIKE FOR INDUSTRY MOVING FORWARD ESPECIALLY WITH LESSONS LEARNED FROM COVERT- BECAUSE WE'RE STILL REALIZING. HELLO INDUSTRY HAS BEEN IMPACTED BY THAT AND HOW WE HAVE BEEN NIMBLE. IN ALLOWING OUR ALCOHOL SALES DIRECTLY TO CONSUMERS- IN WAYS THAT ARE BOTH YOU KNOW CONVENIENT AND- IN RESOLVABLE FROM A- FROM A LEGAL STANDPOINT. OF THIS SITUATION IS- A LITTLE UNUSUAL I HAVE A HISTORY OF SUPPORTING OUR CRAFT BREWERS- WINERIES- DISTILLERIES BY IN MY DISTRICT I THINK IT YOU KNOW FOOD PRODUCTS. ARE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE CAN- FURTHER DEVELOP BECAUSE CALIFORNIA IS A SPECIAL BRAND WE HAVE SPECIAL QUALITIES AND- WE CAN SELL NOT JUST. WITHIN THE US- BUT CERTAINLY- ABROAD- WITH THE WITH THE WITH WITH GREAT SUCCESS. BUT I TOOK A LOOK AT THIS GRAND HOME DECISION AND THE COMMERCE CLAUSE MY FIRST INSTINCT WAS. WE WANT TO PROTECT THIS- SMALL BATCH. DISTILLERIES AND BREWERIES- THAT WE'D FIND A WAY TO LOOK AFTER THE BUDDING INDUSTRIES IN CALIFORNIA- THE SUPREME COURT DECISION IN GRAHAM HOME- INDICATES THAT- THERE MUST BE PARITY BETWEEN IN AND OUT OF STATE SALES OF FOR PURPOSES OF THE COMMERCE CLAUSE. AND I WENT BACK TO MY OLD LAW SCHOOL DAYS AND BEGAN TO FULLY APPRECIATE AND THEN CAME ACROSS THE KENTUCKY RULE- THAT. GOT AROUND THE GRAND HOME DECISION IN THE COMMERCE CLAUSE BUT LIMITING- TO TEN LEADERS- FOR EACH CONSUMER. AND SO I THINK THERE ARE WAYS TO LOOK AFTER IT AND DEVELOP OUR DISTILLERIES. BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO LOOK AFTER WAYS THAT WERE IMPACTING THE MARKET. DISTRIBUTION NETWORKS ARE NOT CHEAP. IT TAKES DRIVERS IT TAKES TRUCKS IT TAKES CENTER. IT TAKES THE G. SIX ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF INVESTMENT AND IF YOU'RE GOING TO INJECT UNCERTAINTY INTO THE MARKET ESPECIALLY IN A POST CODE SITUATION YOU HAVE TO APPRECIATE THE COMPLICATIONS AND IMPLICATIONS. OF YOUR INVOLVEMENT. I THINK THIS IS A THAT WAR. MORE DISCUSSION. I THINK THERE'S A PATH FORWARD HERE YOU KNOW WHETHER IT IS DROPPING IT DOWN AND I'D LIKE TO HEAR FROM THE AUTHOR IN ANY OF MY OTHER COLLEAGUES. THERE SEEMS TO BE WAYS THAT WE CAN- THAT WE CAN. ACHIEVE WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE WHILE STILL LOOKING AFTER THE GOOD PAYING JOBS OF FOLKS THAT WORK IN THE DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM THE FOLKS THAT'LL THAT OWN AND OPERATE. THE DISTRIBUTION NETWORKS- THIS IS NOT A ZERO SUM GAME WITH WINNERS AND LOSERS I THINK THIS COULD BE A WIN WIN SITUATION. BUT THE WAY THAT IT'S DRAFTED RIGHT NOW. I'M AFRAID THERE ARE THERE ARE SO MANY LEGAL QUESTIONS THAT I'M JUST NOW FOR MORE FULLY APPRECIATIVE OF ON FOR EXAMPLE THE CALIFORNIA DEFINITION OF CRAFT. AND A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND GALLONS YOU KNOW IS THAT LIMITED TO THE PRODUCTION OF THE FACILITY OR IS THAT LIMITED TO THE SPECIFIC LINE ITEM- AND ALL USE THE EXAMPLE OF. YOU KNOW IF A PARENT COMPANY- HAS MULTIPLE SMALL BATCH- SUBSIDIARIES YOU KNOW IS IT LIMITED TO THE VODKA. AS OPPOSED TO THE RASPBERRY VODKA. SO THERE'S A NUMBER OF LEGAL ISSUES HERE THAT I WOULD LIKE TIME TO TIBET TO BETTER APPRECIATE MAYBE THE AUTHOR AND POTENTIALLY THE CO AUTHOR CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE- CAN CAN- LINE THIS UP BETTER BUT- I THINK IF WE WERE TO. CONSIDER DROPPING DOWN THE- THE VOLUME TO A TO A RATE THAT DOES NOT AFFECT THE SUPERMARKETS AND THE RETAILERS THAT ARE SELLING YOU KNOW NORMALLY THE LARGE BRAND ITEMS BUT YOU CREATE A SITUATION WHERE SALES NUMBERS CAN MAKE A SMALL BATCH BREWERIES AND DISTILLERIES ATTRACTIVE TO GET ON THE SHELF. THAT COULD HELP OUR INTREPID NOURIEL DOT SET OF INDUSTRIES- SO I DON'T KNOW IF THE AUTHOR HAS ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR EVEN MY COLLEAGUES BUT THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS. IN NORMALLY I DON'T LIKE VOTING ON ON THINGS THAT HAVE SO MUCH TO DO BUT I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR. FROM OTHER FOLKS AND SEE IF THERE IS A WAY. FOR THIS TO BE A WIN WIN SITUATION BECAUSE I THINK IT'S JUST ABOUT THINKING IT THROUGH AND HAVING MORE DISCUSSION. SEVERAL FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO FAKE THANK YOU CENTER FOR JUST FOR THOSE COMMENTS AND OBVIOUSLY THANKS TO MY- MY OTHER COLLEAGUES HAVE SPOKEN SO FAR- THERE THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT WE'RE IN THE WE'RE NOT INTERESTED IN HARMING SMALL BUSINESS WE'RE NOT INTERESTED IN HARMING OUR JOBS- IN MANY RESPECTS I THINK THE IDEA BEHIND THIS BILL IF YOU LOOK AT THE WINE INDUSTRY WE'VE DISCUSSED THIS. THE WHEN SO MY FRIEND FROM LOS ANGELES AND A CALLER SAID SHAME ON ON THE ON THE ON THE DISTRIBUTORS FOR NOT. DOING MORE TO HELP OUT THE SMALL PRODUCERS- I THINK SHE ANSWERED HER OWN CONCERN WHICH HE SAID THAT THE END OF THE DAY THOSE SMALL PRODUCTS THEY JUST DON'T PENCIL OUT THE DISTRIBUTORS ARE REALLY FOCUSED ON ON THE BIG VERY POPULAR PRODUCTS THAT ARE TRIED AND TRUE AND AS THEY SHOULD BE RIGHT I MEAN THAT'S THAT'S THEIR BUSINESS MODEL IS MAKING MONEY SELLING AND DISTRIBUTING. DISTRIBUTING ARE THOSE TRIED AND TRUE PRODUCTS AND WHAT ENDS UP HAPPENING IS IT'S HARD FOR SMALL NICHE PRODUCTS TO BREAK IN TO THE MARKET WHAT'S HAPPENED WITH ONE OF COURSE IS THAT FOLKS GO TO HONOR THE FALLEN LOVE WITH THE WITH THE WITH THE PARTICULAR TYPE OF WINE AND THEY START TO BUY THE WINE THE WORD GETS OUT ABOUT THE WINE AND NEXT THING YOU KNOW THE ONE CONNECTS HER TO GROW IN POPULARITY AND AT SOME POINT THE DISTRICT WILL PICK IT UP BECAUSE THEY RECOGNIZE THAT- IT'S A IT'S A IT'S A POPULAR COLOR NOT LUCKY TAKE A CHANCE ON THE WIND. OUT THE GATE- THERE'S SO MANY GREAT CRAFT WINE PRODUCERS IN DISTILLERS AND BEER PRODUCERS ALL ALL THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND- AND YOU KNOW HOW WHAT WHY WHY WOULD THEY POSSIBLY TAKE A CHANCE ON A SMALL ONE IN LESSER SOME KIND OF INCENTIVE WAS TRADED TO PRODUCTS THAT'S WHAT THIS IS OPENLY ABOUT BEING UP IN SPACE FOR THOSE PRODUCTS TO GET OUT. TO CONSUMERS SO THAT WHEN SOMEONE GOES TO A DEALER THEY GO TO- A BREWERY AND THEY FALL IN LOVE WITH A PARTICULAR PRODUCT AND THEN I PROBABLY NEED TO BE THE CARD STORE THEY CAN FIND A WAY TO GET THE PRODUCT IN THE FUTURE DIRECTLY SHIPPED. TO THAT. NOW I. CLEARLY I A YOU KNOW THE- GUYS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WHAT WILL I'M TALKING. SMALL THIS. AND SMALL PRODUCER. AND THE WAY BILLS RIGHT RIGHT. IT APPLIES TO EVERYBODY. AND I UNDERSTAND THERE'S A LOT OF FOLKS OUT THERE WHO WHO WANT TO LIMIT- SO I DO THINK THERE'S NO QUESTION MY MIND THE BILL WE'RE GONNA TO GO FURTHER AND LIMITING THE NUMBER OF BOTTLES- PER PERSON PER MONTH THAT WE HAVE A CRAFT RIGHT NOW IT'S SET AT THE KENTUCKY STANDARD. I'M HEARING FROM FOLKS THAT WE NEED TO KNOCK THAT NUMBER DOWN I'M ACTUALLY HAPPY TO DO THAT- YOU KNOW SO THAT'S ONE THING. THE OTHER THING IS. THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN BIG PRODUCERS AND SMALL PRODUCERS AND SMALL PRODUCT. AND HERE THE OTHER DAY MY FOCUS IS REALLY ON ON TRYING TO PROVIDE. MORE OPPORTUNITIES MORE ACCESS. FOR FOR THE SMALL BUSINESSES THAT ARE PRODUCING THESE. THESE FANTASTIC ARTISANAL PRODUCTS- YOU KNOW THERE IS A CONSUMER EQUITY QUESTION ASSOCIATED WITH. THE CURRENT SYSTEM AND- AND THE ISSUES THAT WE'RE TRYING TO RESOLVE WITH THIS BILL. BUT SUFFICE TO SAY I YOU KNOW I CAN'T SEE THIS BILL. COULD GET HOW THIS LEGISLATURE WITHOUT- WITH WITHOUT OUR REALLY REALLY. CONFINING V. VIS. A DIRECT CONSUMER. OFFER TO TWO SMALL SMALL BATCH PRODUCTION. I THINK I THINK. THAT WILL ULTIMATELY RESOLVE THE CORE OPPOSITION CONCERNS WE'VE HEARD FROM THE TEAMSTERS AND THE GROCERS IN THE DISTILLERS WHO IN IT. THAT'S RIGHT THE DISTRIBUTORS. WHO OF COURSE IN THE END THEY ARE REALLY FOCUSED ON THE BIG. THE BIG PRODUCTS. I SAY. I YOU KNOW MOST ARE ABLE TO GOING TO- YOU KNOW. WHAT WHAT WHY WOULD THEY WANT TO TELL THE EXTRA SHIPPING WHEN THEY CAN GO DOWN TO THE CORNER STORE AND BUY THE PRODUCT THE MAKER'S MARK DOWN THE CORNER STORE- WHEN THEY CAN YOU KNOW THE SO I DO THINK THAT THIS THIS CONCERN HAS BEEN RAISED ABOUT HOW THIS IS GOING TO COLLAPSE THE SYSTEM IS JUST TOTALLY OVERBLOWN IT'S HYPERBOLIC I JUST DON'T BELIEVE IT'S TRUE BUT I UNDERSTAND THAT PEOPLE ARE. YOU KNOW ALWAYS GOING TO BE CONCERNS ABOUT ANY KINDS OF CHANGES IN IN IN IN THE REGULATORY SYSTEM SO. I I'M ASKING MY COLLEAGUES TO GIVE US THE CHANCE. TO FIGURE OUT A PASSWORD WITH THIS BILL. THAT WILL. THAT WILL FOCUS ON OUR ULTIMATE INTENT WHICH IS TO ALLOW FOR SPACE. FOR HIGH QUALITY. EXCITING ARTISANAL PRODUCTS. TO EXPAND MARKETS TO EXPAND ACCESS. TO CONSUMERS WHO RIGHT NOW HAVE NO WAY OF GETTING THE PRODUCT. IF YOU IF YOU COME FROM. SENATOR JONES IS OFFICE DISTRICT AND YOU'RE UP IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA VISITING THE CAPITAL YOU VISIT A DISTILLER. YOU LOVE THE PRODUCT THAT YOU- THAT YOU FIND HERE. YOU LITERALLY YOU CAN BUY MAYBE A COUPLE BOTTLES AT THE AT THE AT THE AT THE AT THIS AT THE SHOP HERE. BUT YOU THEN THERE'S NO WAY YOU CAN ACCESS THE PRODUCT WAS YOU PHYSICALLY COME YOURSELF. UP HERE TO GET THAT PRODUCT AGAIN THAT'S JUST CRAZY. WE OUGHT TO FIND A WAY TO ALLOW THAT CONSTITUENT FROM ANOTHER PART OF THE STATE. TO BE ABLE TO BUY. A SMALL BIT REASONABLE AMOUNT OF THAT PRODUCT FROM THE OTHER PART OF THE STATE. OR THE OTHER PART OF THE COUNTRY. IT'S IN THE WAY WE HAVE ACROSS RIGHT NOW IS TO SELL A ANTI CONSUMER. AND I'M ASKING COLLEAGUES FOR YOU TO GIVE US THE OPPORTUNITY TO. TO CRAFT A SOLUTION WE'RE GOING TO WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH. FOLKS IN THE TEAMSTERS AND FROM THE DISTRIBUTORS AND FROM THE GROUP. AND THE R. C. W. IN ADDITION TO THE DISTILLERS AND THE PRODUCERS. TO COME UP WITH SOME SOLUTION THAT WILL. GIVE MORE CONSUMER ACCESS. FOR THESE EXCITING NEW PRODUCTS. OUT WITHOUT HARMING LOCAL BUSINESS WITHOUT HARMING. LOCAL JOBS ABBOTT BUT ALLOWING FOR THE SMALL BUSINESSES THAT ARE PRODUCING REALLY GREAT PRODUCTS YOU. TO EXPAND. THEIR ACCESS TO THE MARKETS. THANK YOU. SO WE NEED WE HAVE CENTER WILL SEND A REPORT TO NOTE SENATOR BRADFORD THAT- ALL WANT TO SPEAK TO THIS ISSUE. AND IT'S EVERYBODY'S DEVELOPING THEIR THOUGHTS ON THIS BILL I THOUGHT I'D TAKE AN OPPORTUNITY RIGHT NOW TO OFFER MY REMARKS NOW INSTEAD OF. LATER I WANT TO THANK CENTER OUR FOR TAKING ON THIS REALLY COMPLICATED ISSUE. AS MEMBERS KNOWS THIS BILL HAS BEEN IN PRINT SINCE MARCH OF LAST YEAR. SENATOR ALLEN AGREED TO THE HEARING ON THE BILL WITH A COMMITMENT FROM THE COMMITTEE TO HOLD AN INFORMATIONAL HEARING. DURING OUR FALL RECESS. THE INFORMATION HEARING WAS HELD IN NOVEMBER WHERE I MADE IT CLEAR THAT WE WOULD BE HEARING THIS BILL. IN JANUARY. I WOULD HOPE THAT WE WOULD MAKE MORE PROGRESS OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST NINE MONTHS. AND CERTAINLY OVER THE LAST MONTH AND A HALF. HOWEVER CENTER I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE AMENDMENTS. THAT ARE HERE TODAY TO ALIGN WITH THE DISTILLED SPIRIT LIMITATIONS THOSE CURRENTLY IN PLACE IN KENTUCKY. I UNDERSTAND THAT THE LIMITATION- SOMETHING FITTED LIMITATIONS TOO HIGH MAYBE IT IS STEPS WITH ENOUGH VOTES TO GET THIS OUT OF COMMITTEE TODAY THE BOTH SIDES WILL COME TOGETHER TO HOPEFULLY FIND SOMETHING THAT BOTH SIDES CAN FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH. IN THAT SPIRIT OF COLLABORATION WITH YOUR PERMISSION SENATOR I WOULD LIKE TO JOIN YOU WITH A JOINT OFFER. I HOPE THAT IN DOING SO WE CAN PRESS TO BOTH SUPPORTERS AND OPPONENTS THAT WE'RE ABSOLUTELY COMMITTED TO THE ISSUE THIS ISSUE. I HEARD TODAY IN THE HEARING. AFTER MR LOW PURCHASE SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THE TAX ISSUE ON BEER. THAT RESONATED WITH ME I'VE HEARD ABOUT THE LARGE DISTRIBUTION OF THE JOBS AND EVERYTHING ELSE THE NEGATIVE THINGS THAT COULD HAPPEN WITH THAT. THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IS EASILY ADDRESS AND FINALLY YOU HEARD FROM THE AUTHOR TODAY THAT THE QUANTITY ISSUE WILL ABSOLUTELY BE ADDRESSED AND I AGREE. WITH THAT THIS IS- IOTA CENTER YOU AND I'VE HAD PLENTY OF CONVERSATIONS ABOUT WHAT THIS POSSIBLY COULD LOOK LIKE IN CALIFORNIA. BUT WE NEED TO GET BOTH SIDES REALLY SERIOUS ABOUT WORKING TOGETHER. AND THAT'S WHY THE VOTES ON THE FLOOR TODAY ARE SO INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT. I'LL BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL TODAY WITH YOUR COMMITMENT SURROUNDED CONTINUE WORKING WITH ME. TO GET THROUGH THE PROCESS TO WORK WITH BOTH SIDES AND COME TO THE FLOOR. IN THE- PERHAPS EVEN BEFORE IT GETS TO THE FLOOR WE CAN WORK WITH I'M MAKING NO COMMITMENTS VIEWS A CENTER REPORT TO YOU KNOW. BUT WE CAN WORK WITH THE CENTER AND A YOU KNOW IN APPROPRIATIONS TO GET SOME OF THIS DONE BEFORE IT COMES TO THE FORE SO WITH THAT I'LL MOVE TO CENTER UP AND QUIT. I WANT TO BUILD ON THE ICE I ONE THING I DO WANT TO SAY I DO WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUES I MEAN SENATOR RUBIO FOR EXAMPLE WE HAD EXTENSIVE CONVERSATIONS WHERE SHE LAID OUT CONCERNS. WITH THE BILL LOOK MUCH MUCH ALONG THE LINES OF WHAT WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING IN IN SESSION HERE TODAY- SO MANY OF YOU HAVE DUG IN REALLY DEEP AND REALLY TRY TO GRAPPLE WITH WHAT OUR INTENT IS HERE WITH ALSO THE CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN RACE I JUST WANNA THANK MY COLLEAGUES FOR THE THOUGHTFUL AND ENGAGEMENT. THE YOU'VE HAD I WANT TO WELCOME THAT ENGAGEMENT AS AS AS THE BILL CONTINUES THANK YOU CENTER REPORTING. TO YOU KNOW SORRY TO MAKE YOU WAIT SIR. NO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- AND THE OBVIOUS THEY WANT TO. THE THANK YOUR- LEADERSHIP IN IT BUT- WITH THE AMENDMENTS AND CERTAINLY COMPLEMENT THE AUTHOR- FOR BEING OPEN IN THE CONVERSATION AND- AND- TAKING THE HEART. BOTH THE INTERESTS OF OUR SMALL BUSINESS- NEEDS AND THE CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED- THIS BILL WILL BE COMING TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE NEXT- SO I'M- GOING TO SUPPORT IT TODAY- WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT THOSE FURTHER CONVERSATIONS WILL CONTINUE. AND THAT THEY'LL BE A SECOND BITE AT THE APPLE TO MAKE SURE THAT. THAT WHATEVER DOES COME TO THE FLOOR- IS IN THE RIGHT. PLACE TO RESPECT AND ENCOURAGE ENTREPRENEURSHIP THAT'S BEEN MADE MENTION. AND ALSO THE CONCERNS. ON THE OPPOSITION AS WELL SO. WITH THAT I'LL SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY. AND APPRECIATE ALL THE WORK THAT THE CHAIR AND MR ALLEN HAVE DONE. AND APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS- THAT HAVE BEEN EXPRESSED TODAY BY BOTH SIDES- SO. LOOKING FORWARD TO FINDING THAT SWEET SPOT AS WE MOVE FORWARD SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR AT CENTRE BRADFORD. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I WANT TO THANK ALL OF THE- THE WITNESSES WHO TESTIFIED IN SUPPORT AND IN OPPOSITION TO THIS MEASURE. AND IT'S ONE. THAT WARRANTS THE LOCAL DISCUSSION THAT WE'VE HAD SO FAR AND I FIND MYSELF IN A VERY UNIQUE POSITION BECAUSE I HAVE. SMALL CRAFT DISTILLERS IN MY DISTRICT AS WELL AS THE LARGEST AFRICAN AMERICAN DISTRIBUTOR IN THIS COUNTRY AND MY DISTRICT. AND THEY BOTH HAVE EXPRESSED CONCERNS. IN REGARDS TO THIS MEASURE ALSO EXPRESSED THE BENEFITS THAT COULD BE AFFORDED TO THEM. BECAUSE OF THIS MEASURE BUT AS- HAS BEEN SAID BY MANY OF MY OTHER COLLEAGUES ARE STILL A LOT OF UNANSWERED. QUESTIONS AND I HAVE NO DOUBT THE INTENTIONS OF THIS AUTHOR AND WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE HERE WITH THIS MEASURE. BUT IT LEAVES ME IN A POSITION WHERE I AM NOT READY TO VOTE NO FOR THIS MEASURE BUT AT THE SAME TIME I'M NOT READY TO VOTE YES AND I WOULD HOPE. THAT THOSE ISSUES THAT ARE STILL PENDING WILL BE WORKED OUT AND SO WE CAN HAVE. A MEASURE THAT TRULY ACHIEVES THE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES THAT HAVE BEEN SENT OUT- AND INTENTIONS BECAUSE- AGAIN I'VE HEARD FROM BOTH SIDES AND I WANT TO BE FAIR HRE AND I JUST THINK RIGHT NOW I'M NOT COMFORTABLE WITH WHERE WE FIND OURSELVES RIGHT NOW. THANK YOU SENATOR- CENTER WILL. THANK YOU MR CHAIR- I DON'T WANT TO BEAT A DEAD HORSE BECAUSE I THINK THAT SENATOR BARGES- COMPLETELY ARTICULATED WHERE I'M AT THERE'S OPPORTUNITIES WITH THIS BILL AS WELL AS CHALLENGES I'M PRO CONSUMER BUT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT HAVING AN IMPACT ON THE THREE THREE TIERED SYSTEM I KNOW THAT WE'RE UP AGAINST A LEGISLATIVE DEADLINE I ALSO HAVE GREAT FAITH IN THE AUTHOR AND THIS COMMITTEE CHAIR- SO I INVENTED BOTH TO MOVE THE BILL TODAY. AND RESERVE RIGHT- TO CHANGE MY MIND IF WE GO BY AND THEN WHATEVER THAT SWEET SPOT IS I THINK IT'S STILL PROBABLY A LITTLE BIT TOO BROAD BUT I'M HOPEFUL- WITH BOTH SIDES COMING TOGETHER THAT WE CAN REACH A CONSENSUS THAT'S GOING TO BENEFIT EVERYONE SO. THOSE ARE THOSE ARE MY COMMENTS TODAY THANK YOU SIR. THANK YOU SENATOR SENATOR JONES THANK YOU MR CHAIR AND- MR ALLEN. YOU KNOW IT'S NOT OFTEN THAT- YOU KNOW ON BILLS LIKE THIS AND I'M AUTHORED YOU KNOW BILLS FOR THE CRAFT BREWERIES AND FOR THE CRAFT DISTILLERS- AND SO I THINK YOU KNOW WE'RE ON THE SAME PAGE AS FAR AS THAT. AND I RARELY HEAR FROM MY- DISTRICT CONSTITUENTS ON THESE ISSUES BUT I WILL LET YOU KNOW THAT- ON THIS PARTICULAR BILL THE WAY IT'S CURRENTLY CRAFTED- MY PHONE AND EMAIL HAS BLOWN UP. WITH CONCERNS FROM MY LOCAL CONSTITUENTS SO- I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO GETTING TO A POINT WHERE I CAN SEE YOU. IN OFFICE I HAVE A BILL THAT WE CAN SUPPORT IT I'M GONNA MAKE A COMMITMENT TO THE AUTHOR THAT IN THE MEANTIME I'M GONNA. HOLD A TOWN HALL MEETING WITH THE- MY LOCAL CONDITIONS THAT ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THIS BILL. AND SEE IF YOU KNOW I CAN- YOU KNOW ARTICULATE SOME OF THE CONCERNS. AND ANSWER SOME OF THEIR CONCERNS THAT THEY HAVE REGARDING THIS SO THAT- THERE'S A COMFORT LEVEL WITH HIM MY CONSTITUENTS. HOW TO MOVE FORWARD SO IT TODAY I'LL BE LAYING OFF BUT I'M I'M GOING TO. WORK IN MY OWN DISTRICT TO MAKE SURE THAT I CAN. COMMUNICATE WITH MY CONSTITUENTS TO HELP OUT ON THIS ISSUE. ANY OTHER MEMBERS WISHING TO SPEAK. SEEING NONE- SEVERAL MUCH LIKE WHAT'S IT SKEWS ME CENTER ARCHULETA. HERE I'M GOING TO HOLD OFF TODAY- I FEEL THAT THEY'RE SO CLOSE I'VE TALKED TO BOTH SIDES AND I GET THE FEELING THAT THEY'RE VERY CLOSE AND I THINK WE SHOULD JUST LET THEM COME TOGETHER SO- FROM WHAT WE HEARD FROM MY COLLEAGUES- I JUST CAN'T GO FORWARD WITH IT RIGHT NOW BUT WHEN IT- WHEN THEY COME TOGETHER AND I KNOW THEY WILL IT SEEMS LIKE IT IT SEEMS LIKE OUR AUTHORS. IS DETERMINED TO GET TOGETHER AND I THINK WE CAN DO THAT. SO I'LL BE HOLDING OFF TODAY. THE OTHER ANYBODY ELSE. SEE NON CENTER ALOE WHICH I CLOSE. I WOULD RESPECT COLLEAGUES ON IT'S HARD TO GET PEOPLE TOGETHER IF YOU ALL HOLD OFF- YOU KNOW WE ARE UP AGAINST A DEADLINE AND LIFT THIS DEADLINES NOT THIS THAT WE VOLUNTARILY HELD THIS BILL BACK LAST YEAR SO AS TO ALLOW FOR TIME. IN THE PROCESS ARE WE HELD A HEARING- WE'VE YOU KNOW THAT THE OPPOSITION IS COMING IN AS IS TYPICAL YOU KNOW VERY VERY LATE AND HEAVY JUST OVER THE LAST TWENTY FOUR HOURS I UNDERSTAND- YOU KNOW IT IT IT'S I UNDERSTAND THE PRESSURE THAT THE FOLKS ARE UNDER.

OUR FOLLOW THE PRODUCT AND THEN TO HAVE IT SHIPPED DIRECTLY TO YOU IF IT'S NOT AVAILABLE AT YOUR LOCAL STORE. EVERYONE'S GOING TO SAY YES AND YET.

HI I'M ASKING YOU TO GIVE US THE OPPORTUNITY TO KEEP WORKING ON THIS- THIS IS ULTIMATELY PROCHAN SIMMER BILL. AND WE ARE ABSOLUTELY COMMITTED TO FINDING AN EQUITABLE SOLUTION THAT WILL ADDRESS THE CONCERNS OF OUR FRIENDS FROM LABOR ADDRESS OUR CONCERNS IN THE SMALL BUSINESS COMMUNITY THE GROCERS. AND DISTRIBUTORS I THINK THERE'S A PATH HERE. AND I ASK YOU TO GIVE US THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK ON ON DEVELOPING A DEVICE IN THAT PATH AS IT GOES THE APPROPRIATIONS PROCESS AND THEN ON.

AND IF THIS THING ONLY HAS SEVEN THEN YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO DO ANYTHING BECAUSE IT WILL DIE. AND THEN ALL PARTIES WILL LOSE SO. IF YOU COULDN'T TELL ME BY JUST- RESTATING YOUR A COMMITMENT LEVELS ON THE ISSUES THAT WERE DISCUSSED IN RAISED IN THIS POLICY COMMITTEE- THAT MAY HELP ME. BECAUSE I CERTAINLY.

NOW I DO THINK THAT IN THE END OF THE DAY. OUR OUR CORE GOALS ARE NOT IN CONGRESS. I AND THEN WHAT IS WHAT'S THE WHAT SORT OF DEAL WITH THIS LOOK LIKE I THINK IT'S ULTIMATELY GOING TO HAVE TO INVOLVE LOWERING THE NUMBER OF BOTTLES ARE PER CONSUMER PER MONTH AND I THINK WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO FIGURE OUT SOME PATH TO- TO REALLY FOCUS THE BILL AND ON THOSE SMALLER PRODUCTS THOSE THOSE THOSE SMALLER VOLUME PRODUCTS THAT STRUGGLE TO GET OUT INTO THE BROADER MARKET THAT ARE HARD FOR THE AVERAGE CONSUMER.
