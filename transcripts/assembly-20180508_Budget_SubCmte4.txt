MOVE ON TO ITEM NUMBER ONE HAD PART OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT. HOMELESSNESS. SO RESTORED OFF WITH. BUDGET CHAIR TEAM. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR IT'S HONOR TO BE HERE AND NOW. BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE FOUR TO TALK ABOUT ONE OF THE MOST PRESSING ISSUES. IN OUR STATE ON HOMELESSNESS USED TO BE A. ISSUE THAT WAS PRIMARILY LEFT FOR URBAN CALIFORNIA NOW WE'RE SEEING IT IN SUBURBAN AND RURAL CALIFORNIA. PROBABLY HAPPENING EVERYWHERE ON ANY GIVEN NIGHT WE CAN HAVE OVER A HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND HOMELESS PEOPLE ON OUR STREETS. WHICH IS JUST ABSOLUTELY UNACCEPTABLE WORKS TOWARD NEARLY PROUD THAT OUR STATE JUST BECAME THE WORLD'S FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY. BUT WHAT'S THE POINT OF BEING THE FIFTH LARGEST COMIC WE CAN'T HOUSE EVERY SINGLE CALIFORNIA. SO TODAY. WE BRING FORWARD A PROPOSAL ON THE BACKS OF FIVE MUCH OF THE WORK THAT WE'VE DONE ON HOUSING IN TERMS OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT IN. AFFORDABLE HOUSING INCENTIVES WHICH I THINK ARE OBSOLETE CRITICAL IS JUST A HOP ALSO TO FOCUS ON PRIMARILY. A RAPIDLY HOUSING EMERGENCY RESPONSES SUPPORTIVE HOUSING. VERY MUCH TRYING TO GET PEOPLE OFF THE STREET INTO THE MEDIA SHELTERS OF THIS PROPOSAL WAS CRAFTED. IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE ELEVEN LARGE CITY MAYORS OF BUT IT IS FUND IS IT IS A ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET REQUEST THAT ANY CITY. ANY CITY CAN REQUEST AND GET FUNDING FOR AND IT'S A MATCHING PROGRAM SO THAT CITIES WOULD GET THEIR FUNDING MATCHED BASED ON A WHAT THEY WANT TO EXPAND AND JUST TO GIVE YOU A COUPLE IDEAS OF WHAT IS. HOW WOULD OUR POTENTIAL EXPENDITURES IT COULD BE SHELTERED DIVERSION RAPID RE HOUSING RENTAL ASSISTANCE? EMERGENCY SHELTER NAVIGATION CENTERS BRIDGE HOUSING AND PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING. ARM AS YOU ALL KNOW CITIES ON THE FRONT LINES THE SEE THIS POPULATION EVERY DAY. THE POPULATION NO LONGER IS JUST. SEEN AT THE POPULATION THE PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO LOOK AT THESE IS NOW A PUBLIC HEALTH HAZARD WE SAW A HEPATITIS OUTBREAK IN SAN DIEGO. IT IS NOW A PUBLIC SAFETY ISSUE. BECAUSE WE ARE SEEING THIS. POPULATION GROW ENDED IN PARTICULAR IS FRANKLY IT'S IT'S AN ISSUE OF HUMANITY WHETHER WE CAN'T ACCEPT OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE ON OUR STREETS EVERY NIGHT THE SAME TIME. THAT WE HAVE. THE LARGEST ECONOMY OF ANY STATE IN THE COUNTRY SO. WITHOUT I APOLOGIZE BECAUSE I CANNOT STAY THROUGH ALL THE DELIBERATIONS BUT WE HAVE OUR TWO EXPERTS IN ONE. ON ONE FORMER ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND SENATOR WHO WAS ON HIS WAY. MAKING A. MAKING AN ENTRANCE AND HE'S GONNA ANSWER ALL YOUR QUESTIONS BUT LET ME TURN IT OVER TO ARMED. MISA. BRENDA SHOCKLEY WHO IS THE DEPUTY MAYOR OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT FOR THE OFFICE OF LOS ANGELES MAYOR ERIC GARCETTI. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU. TWO THE COMMITTEE TO THE CHAIR. ON BEHALF OF MAYOR ERIC GARCETTI IN THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES. I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR GIVING US THE OPPORTUNITY. TO. DESCRIBE. WHY WE HAVE JOINED WITH THE? ELEVENTH THE BIG ELEVEN MAYORS. TO SEEK SOME RELIEF FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO ADDRESS THE CRISIS OF HOMELESSNESS. AND SOME WAYS IT'S PRETTY OF. IT'S APPROPRIATE THAT I SHOULD GO FIRST BECAUSE THE. CITY AND COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES REPRESENT APPROXIMATELY ONE HALF OF ALL HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. CITY HAS. AND THE COUNTY TOGETHER HAVE. TAKE AN ENORMOUS STEPS. IN THE FORM OF UP BOND MEASURE OF ONE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS FOR. PERMITTED SUPPORTIVE HOUSING THAT WILL BE BUILT OVER TEN YEARS AND IT WOULD BE TEN THOUSAND UNITS THOUSAND EACH YEAR. COUPLED WITH THE QUARTER PERCENT SALES TAX THAT THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES VOTERS APPROVED. THAT. WILL PROVIDE SUPPORT SERVICES. YEAH. MISTER MAYOR. SORRY. IT IS VERY GOOD AND. YOU IT IS HARD TO KNOW. I'LL THAT. QUARTER PERCENT SALES TAX THAT WAS A COMPANION EFFORT BY THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES TO PROVIDES UP. SUPPORTIVE SERVICES TO THOSE WHO WERE BEING HOUSED. ON ANY GIVEN NIGHT IN THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES WHERE WE HAVE SOME THIRTY FOUR THOUSAND HOMELESS PEOPLE. EIGHTY PERCENT OFTHOSE PEOPLE ARE. LIVING EITHER IN ENCAMPMENTS ON THE STREET OR IN VEHICLES. UNDER PASSES INTO THE FREEWAY. AND. IT IS FAR BEYOND JUST AN ISSUE OF QUALITY OF LIFE. THAT IT REALLY IN THE LAST YEAR. AND I IN THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES OVER EIGHT HUNDRED. HOMELESS PEOPLE DIED. AND THE PRESSURE ON THE. HOSPITAL AND HEALTH SYSTEM LAW ENFORCEMENT. CITY SERVICES IS IS ENORMOUS. BOB THE CITY HAS TAKEN. AND AND FOUND WAYS IN THE LAST TWO YEARS TO. QUADRUPLE ITS INVESTMENT IN ADDRESSING HOMELESSNESS. BUT IT'S STILL NOT ENOUGH. IN THE LAST TWO YEARS WE'VE HAD A THIRTEEN PERCENTAGE CREEK INCREASE IN HOMELESSNESS AND LAST YEAR WAS A TWENTY ERCENT INCREASE. WE WILL KNOW LATER THIS MONTH AND WE'RE HOPEFUL THAT IT WON'T BE AS HIGH BUT WE ARE ACCEPTING THAT THERE WILL BE AGAIN MORE INCREASE. THE ABILITY TO MEET THESE CHALLENGES AND TO MEET THIS CRISIS. AND IT IS IT'S A CRISES. WHAT I'VE HEARD WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS IN THE PAST THAT? WELL IT'S IT'S NOT AN EARTHQUAKE IN ITS NOT A FIRE I IT'S NOT A DISASTER. BUT I TRULY BEG TO DIFFER AND I THINK FOR EACH OF YOU AS YOU MOVE ABOUT. STEP OVER PEOPLE TO GET WHERE YOU HAVE TO GO THAT IT'S BECOME WHERE IT'S IN THE CITY IT. HAS BECOME AMOST NORMAL BECAUSE PEOPLE CANNOT SAFELY SLEEP AT NIGHT THEY SLEEP IN THE DAY IN THEIR TENTS. ON THE STREET IN THE BUSINESS TO OUR. PARTS OF THE BUSINESS I SEE JEFF NODDING BECAUSE I KNOW THAT MARKET ST. IT'S IT'S NOT UNUSUAL AT ALL TO HAVE TO GO THROUGH OUR AROUND THE TENT IN ORDER TO. EVEN CONDUCT BUSINESS BUT MORE THAN THAT. IN AS WAS SAID US. DATE THAT HAS NOW THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD. THERE. IS SUCH A NEED. AND. THE RESOURCES TO BE ABLE TO MOVE IMMEDIATELY. WE'VE HOUSE THIRTY THOUSAND PEOPLE OVER TIME MUCH THERE'S. I COULD GO INTO THE LITANY OF EFFORTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE AND I'LL BE HAPPY TO DO SO IF YOU LIKE. BUT THE POINT IS THAT. NO ONE AND NO SYSTEM. IN THIS STATE. PREPARED FOR THE PERFECT STORM THAT CREATES THE INFLOW INTO HOPELESSNESS. WHERE YOU HAVE THE AFFORDABILITY? PEOPLE WHO WORK EVERYDAY BUT CANNOT AFFORD TO LIVE. AND I THINK IN LOS ANGELES NOW A ONE BEDROOM APARTMENT IS TWENTY FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH AND THAT IS NOT HIGH END THAT'S JUST BEING ABLE TO. LIVE IN A BUILDING. THAT. YOU HAVE IN ADDITION TO THAT THE PEOPLE THAT ARE. AS A RESULT OF. PROP FORTY SEVEN THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE AND THERE WAS A RECENT STUDY THE NUMBER OF HOMELESS PEOPLE WHO HAVE HAD CONTACT. WITH THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM IN THIS COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES IS CLOSE TO SIXTY FIVE. PERCENT AND AS A RESULT SO MANY OF THE BARRIERS THAT PREVENT THEM FROM GETTING HOUSING AND CLAIM AT. ALL OF THOSE FOLD INTO WHY WE NEED FLEXIBLE DOLLARS TO ADDRESS PREVENTION. WE NEED FLEXIBLE DOLLARS TO BE ABLE TO LOOK AT. IN ADDITION TO BUILDING HOUSING LOOKING AT EXISTING STRUCTURES AND BEING ABLE TO MOVE QUICKLY TO RENOVATE TO NOT HAVE IT BE A HALF MILLION DOLLARS A UNIT IN THREE TO FIVE YEARS DOWN THE LINE. BUT TO REALLY MOVE PEOPLE. OFF THE STREETS. I UNDERSTAND AND I TOTALLY AGREE AND SO DOES THE MAYOR THAT THE BEST PRACTICE IS PERMANENT HOUSING. AND THE BEST PRACTICE FOR CHRONICALLY HOMELESS. INDIVIDUALS IS PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING. HOWEVER IN THE MEANTIME. AND I REPEAT THAT IN THE MEANTIME WE HAVE PEOPLE. THE BARELY EXISTE. LIVING WITHOUT. HI BASIC HYGIENE. LIVING WITHOUT. WATER LIVING WITHOUT. BOB THE ABILITY TO EVEN CARE FOR THEMSELVES OR THEIR FAMILIES OR EVEN BE IN A POSITION TO GO. FOR TRAINING OR EMPLOYMENT BECAUSE THEY ARE LIVING ON THE STREET. AND I BELIEVE SO STRONGLY AND I REALLY BESEECH YOU TO THINK ABOUT. THIS AS THE CRISIS TO RESPOND TO IT AS WE WOULD A HURRICANE AS WE WOULD AN EARTHQUAKE AS WE WOULD. ANY OTHER NATURAL DISASTER BECAUSE THIS IS A DISASTER. THAT IS THE RESULT OF ANY NUMBER OF CHOICES THAT HAVE COME TOGETHER IN OUR SYSTEM. AND IN OUR CITIES AND I BELIEVE IF WE HAD FUNDING THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO STABILIZE TO GET PEOPLE OFF THE STREETS TO BE ABLE. TO. MOVE THE ENCAMPMENTS. IN A WAY WOULD THEN YOU COULD HAVE. THE ABILITY TO MUCH MORE SYSTEMATICALLY. ADDRESS THE ISSUE THAT IT IT WOULD GIVE AND IT REQUIRES AN INFLUX OF RESOURCES BECAUSE AYE WHETHER IT IS SACRAMENTO. OR SAN DIEGO OR LOS ANGELES OR SAN JOSE. IT IS CRIPPLING. AND REALLY UNDERMINING. OUR NEW STATUS. AS THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THIS WORLD. THANK YOU THEIR STEINBERG. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. APOLOGIZE WAS CHAIRMAN FOR BEING ON A MOMENT LET MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. I AGREE WITH EVERYTHING MY COLLEAGUE JUST SAID AND. AND I CHOOSE TO FOCUS MY REMARKS OF. EVEN MORE SPECIFICALLY ON WHAT'S MISSING FROM OUR CURRENT SYSTEM BECAUSE I THINK. I HOPE WE ALL RECOGNISE BE VIRTUE OF LIVING. IN CALIFORNIA AND NOT JUST NOT JUST OUR MAJOR URBAN CENTERS POTENTIALLY SPREADING BEYOND. THAT HOMELESSNESS IS IN FACT A MAJOR PUBLIC HEALTH A PUBLIC SAFETY. DE CRISIS AND A CRISIS OF CONSCIENCE. I WANNA TALK ABOUT WHAT WE'RE MISSING HERE IN SACRAMENTO BECAUSE. BOB IN OUR CITY. SINCE I BECAME MAYOR NOW SIXTEEN MONTHS AGO. WE A FOCUSED ON ALL THE KEY ELEMENTS THAT IT WILL TAKE WE BELIEVED ACTUALLY GET THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE OFF THE STREETS AND HOUSED. WE OUR RECIPIENT OF THE WHOLE PERSON CARE. GRANT APPROACH WHICH USUALLY COUNTY. BASED ARE ARE COUNTY DID NOT APPLY OUR CITY DID. WE HAVE SIXTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS TO ENGAGE IN INTENSIVE OUTREACH. FOR. SEVERAL THOUSAND PEOPLE. YOU KNOW THE PROBLEM WAS THAT MANY OF THE PEOPLE THAT HOMELESS FOR A LONG TIME. YES THERE TREATMENT RESISTANT. BUT THEY ALSO HAVEN'T BEEN INTERVENED WITHIN AN ASSERTIVE AND CONSISTENT WAY. TO BUILD THE TRUST THAT ALLOWS SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THOSE PEOPLE TO AGREE EVENTUALLY MAY TAKE MONTHS. THE TO COME IN AND GET HELP. WE HAVE THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. THROUGH THE COUNTY PROPOSITION SIXTY THREE THE MEASURE I AUTHORED WHEN HOSS SERVICES ACTOR FORTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS. TO PROVIDE MENTAL HEALTH AND WRAPAROUND SERVICES. WHAT WE AND WE ARE WORKING HARD TOWARD BUILDING AN INVENTORY OF PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING FOCUSED ON EFFICIENCY HOMES? AND. A AND AS MANY RENTAL UNITS AS WE CAN BILL. BUT. TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS WITHOUT AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE WITHOUT THAT BRIDGE BETWEEN. THAT ASSERTIVE OUTREACH AND PERMANENT HOUSING. YOU NEVER GET PEOPLE FROM THE RIVER BANKS FOR THE STREET INTO THE PERMANENT HOUSING. AND SO IT'S NOT AN EITHER OR. AND I MIGHT SAY THAT WALL THE BIG ELEVEN. CITIES OF WHICH I AM THE CHAIR OF PUT FORWARD A SPECIFIC CITY. PROPOSAL. THAT WOULD PROVIDE A BILLION FIVE OF STATE FUNDING FOR. WHATEVER IT TAKES FOR CITIES TO RESPOND TO THE EMERGENCY WERE ACTUALLY WORKING QUITE COLLABORATIVE LEAN CLOSELY WITH OUR COUNTY PARTNERS. BECAUSE WE RECOGNIZE THAT THAT. THAT. IT'S NOT EITHER OR. AND AND THAT. WERE WERE MUCH BETTER OFF WORKING TOGETHER WITHIN CITIES AND COUNTIES BUT HERE AT THE STATE HOUSE AS WELL. AS WE ALL SEE THE RESOURCES TO ADDRESS THIS CRISIS. BUT OUR PIECE OF IT WHICH WE MUST CALL OUT IS NOT BECAUSE IT'S OUR PEACE. COULD BE ADMINISTERED YOU KNOW. BY ANY NONPROFIT BY ANYBODY. IS TO ADDRESS. THAT EMERGENCY PEACE WITH THE CITY'S NEED FLEXIBLE DOLLARS DO THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT SERVICES GO IN LA. AND SACCHARINE ARE BEGINNING TO DO WE HAVE ONE TRIAGE. CENTER IN NORTH SACRAMENTO ITS PILOT PUBLICIZED. IT WAS CONTROVERSIAL BEEN A HUGE SUCCESS. WE'VE GOTTEN THREE HUNDRED PEOPLE THREE HUNDRED MOST INTRACTABLE HOMELESS PEOPLE OFF THE STREETS. AND YES IT'S NOT THE RITZ. BUT. IT IS. BRIDGE. A PERMANENT HOUSING I HAVE NO MORE CAPACITY IN MY CITY NOW HAVE NOWHERE BUDGET DOLLARS. TO BE ABLE TO EXPAND. TRIPLE THAT CAPACITY WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT WE WANT TO DO TO GET TWO THOUSAND PEOPLE. OFF THE STREET WE NEED A PARTNERSHIP WITH THE STATE HERE FINANCIAL PARTNERSHIP. AND IF THE SURPLUS IS WHAT I KNOW YOU ALL HOPE IS. AND YOUR LOOKING FOR ONE TIME MONEY WE WILL USE IT TO BUILD THE INFRASTRUCTURE AGAIN IN COLLABORATION WITH OUR COUNTY PARTNERS AND OUR NON PROFITS. WE WILL USE IT TO BUILD THE INFRASTRUCTURE. TO BE ABLE TO HAVE GENUINELY ALL THAT IT TAKES. TO MAKE A DRAMATIC IMPACT ON THIS PROBLEM. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS JEFF CASSETTES KIM OF THE DIRECTOR OF SAN FRANCISCO'S DEPARTMENT OF HOMELESSNESS AND SUPPORTIVE HOUSING. MAYOR FARRELL REGRETS HE WASN'T ABLE TO ATTEND THE MEETING TODAY BUT OUT OF TO SHARE WITH YOU SOME OF OUR THOUGHTS. ON WHAT'S GOING ON IN IN OUR CITY AND IN OUR STATE. OTHER DEPARTMENT OF HOMELESSNESS IN SUPPORT OF HOUSING. COMBINED SERVICES AND PROGRAMS FROM MULTIPLE DEPARTMENTS IN THE CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO INTO ONE DEPARTMENT WHERE WE NOW HAVE ONE STRATEGY THAT WE'RE WORKING TO IMPLEMENT IN ORDER TO REDUCE. HOMELESSNESS AND IN SAN FRANCISCO. WAS HAVE BEEN DOING THIS WORK FOR ALMOST THIRTY YEARS ARE MOSTLY IN THE NONPROFIT SECTOR. JUST TWENTY THREE MONTHS. IN GOVERNMENT AND STARTED OUT AS AN OUTREACH WORKER AND WILL TELL YOU THAT I DON'T THINK MY HEART COULD BREAK ANYMORE. BUT SOMEHOW IT HAS MANAGED TO. THE. SERVE IN PERFECT STORM OF THE HOUSING CRISIS IN THE STATE THE LACK OF SHELTER IN CALIFORNIA. THE. OPIOID AND METH AMPHETAMINE EPIDEMICS IN OUR STATE AND MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES HAVE CREATED SOMETHING I'VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE IN DOING THIS WORK FOR NEARLY THIRTY YEARS AND NOT JUST IN SAN FRANCISCO. OF BUT ALL OVER THE STATE WITH PEOPLE. LIVING BY SO MANY PEOPLE LIVING SO DESPERATELY ON OUR STREETS. WITH NOWHERE TO GO. NOWHERE TO TAKE CARE OF THEIR BASIC NEEDS AND. AND JUST FALLING DEEPER DEEPER INTO DESPAIR. WHICH OFTENTIMES A LEAST MEANS DEEPER AND DEEPER INTO A ADDICTION AND UNTREATED MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA HAS NEARLY A QUARTER OF ALL HOMELESS PEOPLE. IN THE UNITED STATES. DURING THE LAST YEAR BETWEEN TWENTY SIXTEEN TO TWENTY SEVENTEEN WE SAW A FIFTEEN PERCENT INCREASE I IN HOMELESSNESS IN OUR STATE. ARE WE THIRTY FIVE OUT OF EVERY TEN THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS ARE HOMELESS WHICH IS TWICE THE NATIONAL AVERAGE. AND SIXTY EIGHT PERCENT OF THE ON SHELTERED POPULAR ART SIXTY PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE ON THE STREETS. IN CALIFORNIA ARE ON SHELTERED WE HAVE NEARLY A FIFTH OF THE COUNTRY'S ON SHELTER HOMELESS POPULATION. AND SAN FRANCISCO WE CURRENTLY HAVE ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE HUNDRED PEOPLE ON OUR STREETS ON ANY GIVEN NIGHT. ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND OF THEM ARE LITERALLY LIVING ON THE STREETS. THE OTHERS ARE IN SHELTER AND TRANSITIONAL HOUSING PROGRAMS BUT THAT DOESN'T REALLY. EXPLAIN THE FULL SCOPE OF THE PROGRAM THAT AND OF SACRAMENTO IN LA ARE ARE DEALING WITH WHICH SET THAT SEVENTY FIVE HUNDRED PEOPLE ON ANY GIVEN NIGHT. WE ESTIMATE ABOUT TWENTY ONE THOUSAND PEOPLE A YEAR ARE HOMELESS IN SAN FRANCISCO ALONE. COMING IN AND OUT OF OUR CITY ARE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. ASSEMBLY CISCO'S INVESTED I THINK WELL. IN THIS ISSUE I MET DEPARTMENTS BUDGET IS APPROXIMATELY TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. AB JUST UNDER TWO HUNDRED MILLION OF THAT COMES FROM COUNTY FUNDS. WE HAVE A MORE PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING PRATAPADITYA THAN ANY OTHER CITY. IN THE UNITED STATES OUT AND ALTHOUGH WE ONLY HAVE TWENTY FOUR PERCENT OF THE BAY AREA'S HOMELESS POPULATION WITH ABOUT A THIRD OF THE BAY AREA SHELTERS. AND WE HAVE ABOUT ALMOST FIFTY OR FORTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING. SO I WAS ASKED TO TALK ABOUT. HYPOTHETICALLY WHAT WOULD WE DO WITH A INCREASED INVESTMENTS FROM THE STATE ON A ONE TIME BASIS AND I I APPRECIATE. HAVING THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THIS DISCUSSION AND I THINK THE IDEA OF HAVING A FLEXIBLE PART OF FUNDING THAT'S AVAILABLE FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO DETERMINE HOW TO USE A. IS VERY MUCH NEEDED UP BY THE STATE. WE IN IN SAN FRANCISCO WHERE WE TO HAVE SAY THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS IN ADDITIONAL FUNDING THAT WAS JUST ONE TIME. WE COULD PREVENT A THOUSAND PEOPLE. FROM BECOMING HOMELESS. WE COULD HELP FIVE HUNDRED PEOPLE UP PERMANENTLY EXIT HOMELESSNESS ARE THROUGH OUR TEMPORARY RENT SUBSIDY PROGRAM CALLED RAPID RE HOUSING. AND WE CAN PROVIDE SHELTER TO ADDITIONAL SEVEN HUNDRED TO EIGHT HUNDRED PEOPLE A YEAR. IF WE WERE ABLE TO HAVE THE FUNDS TO PURCHASE ADDITIONAL SHELTER FACILITIES WHICH WE WE DESPERATELY NEED. I THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT YOU DON'T. ALL OF OUR CITIES ARE IN DIFFERENT PLACES. IN TERMS OF WHAT OUR INFRASTRUCTURE LOOKS LIKE. AGAIN CENTER CISCO DOES HAVE QUITE A BIT OF PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING BUT WE HOUSE WE HELP FIFTY PEOPLE EVERY WEEK EXIT HOMELESSNESS WHICH I'M INCREDIBLY PROUD OF AND GRATEFUL FOR. A CITY THAT DOES SUCH AMAZING WORK BUT EVERY WEEK. APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED AND FIFTY NEWLY HOMELESS PEOPLE ARE IN SAN FRANCISCO SO WE KEEP RUNNING ON THAT. YOU KNOW WE KEEP OPERATING THE SAME WAY WE'VE BEEN DOING BUSINESS ON WE'RE NOT GOING TO GET THE JOB DONE. SO I THINK FOCUS ON HAVING THE OPPORTUNITY TO USE THESE FUNDS TO FOCUS ON PREVENTION AND DIVERSION. TO FOCUS ON ADDRESSING TEMPORARY SHELTER NEEDS. AND TO FOCUS ON THINGS LIKE RAPID RE HOUSING WHICH USE THE PRIVATE MARKET IN ORDER TO HELP HOMELESS PEOPLE FIND A PLACE TO LIVE ARE INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT COMPONENTS. AND I KNOW THAT THE OTHER QUESTION. THAT SOME OF YOUR PROBABLY ASKING IT'S WE JUST KEEP THROWING MONEY AT THE PROBLEM. IS IT CAN GET BETTER. HOW DO WE KNOW IT'S GOING TO GET BETTER BY THINK WE KNOW? YOU KNOW A LOT OF THINGS. THAT WOULD INDICATE THAT IT CRAFTING CREASED INVESTMENTS WILL HAVE AN IMPACT SOME OF ITS SORT OF COUNTER FACTUAL LIKE WE KNOW THE FACT THAT. THE HUD BUDGET CUTS BUDGET AUTHORITY IS A TWENTY PERCENT OF WHAT IT WAS IN NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT IN CURRENT DOLLARS AND THAT CORRESPONDS DIRECTLY TO THE RISE OF MODERN DAY HOMELESSNESS IN THE UNITED STATES. BUT WE KNOW THAT CALIFORNIA'S ALL DECREASE IN FUNDING FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. STARTING IN ABOUT TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT AND THAT WE KNOW DURING THAT TIME WHERE WE HAD SEEN A DECREASE IN HOMELESSNESS. FOOT FOR QUITE SOMETIME IN THE STATE AYE THAT SEEM TO HAVE LED DIRECTLY TO A AN INCREASE AYE IN HOMELESSNESS AND I THINK OUR BUT OUR OWN EXPERIENCE IN THOSE ARE SORT OF A. COUNTER FACTUAL THING SOME OF THE POSITIVE I IMPACTS I THINK. CAN BE SEEN IN SAN FRANCISCO WHERE WE HAVE A RECENTLY INCREASED OUR INVESTMENTS UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF MERRILY. AND ALTHOUGH IT'S NOTHING TO WRITE HOME ABOUT AYE WE SAW A ONE PERCENT DECREASE IN HOMELESSNESS FROM TWENTY FIFTEEN TO TWENTY SEVENTEEN. BUCKING THE TRENDS OF ALMOST EVERY CITY ON THE WEST COAST AND ALL THAT MOST EVERY CITY NATIONALLY AND CERTAINLY. BUCKING THE TRENDS AYE IN CALIFORNIA AND WHEN WE DUG DEEP INTO WHY THAT HAPPENED. OUT WE LOOKED AT WORD WE INVEST IN WHAT WERE THE OUTCOME SO WE FOUND THAT THE AREAS WHERE WE INCREASED OUR INVESTMENTS AND YOU'VE HOMELESSNESS. I IN FAMILY HOMELESSNESS AND VETERANS HOMELESSNESS SAW SOME REALLY GOOD I IMPACTS WE SOLVE OF BETWEEN TWENTY FIFTEEN AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN TO THIRTY PERCENT REDUCTION. AYE IN CHRONIC VETERANS HOMELESSNESS WE SAW THIRTEEN PERCENT REDUCTION IN YOUTH HOMELESSNESS IN A TWELVE PERCENT REDUCTION IN FAMILY HOMELESSNESS DUE TO THESE INCREASED INVESTMENTS AYE THAT WERE MADE. UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF MERRILY AND I BELIEVE THAT SIDE NATIONALLY. AND BOTH YOU KNOW LOCALLY IN WITHIN OUR STATE THERE'S PLENTY OF EVIDENCE TO SHOW THAT WHEN YOU MAKE SMART. TARGETED INVESTMENTS BASED ON AYE DATA AND BASED ON WHAT THE COMMUNITY HAS IDENTIFIED BY ITS NEEDS TO BE A WE CAN WE CAN MAKE PROGRESS WE'VE DONE IT BEFORE IN CALIFORNIA. AND I'M I'M CONFIDENT THAT WE CAN WE CAN DO IT AGAIN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU I'VE QUESTION FOR MAYOR STEINBERG IN YOUR TESTIMONY MENTIONED FLEXIBILITY. NAM WAS THAT MEAN. WELL FIRST OF ALL ANY PUBLIC MONEY OF COURSE NEEDS TO COME WITH A OUTCOME BASED ACCOUNTABILITY AND SO WE WOULD EXPECT. UPON RECEIPT OF THESE RESOURCES TO ACTUALLY DEMONSTRATE. THAT WE WERE USING THE RESOURCES TO ACTUALLY HELP GET. PEOPLE OFF THE STREET. BUT WHEN I WENT WHAT WE MEAN BY FLEXIBILITY IS THE ABILITY TO USE THE MONEY. FOR A VARIETY OF THINGS THAT ARE GOING TO BRIDGE BETWEEN. THE OUT REACH. THE INTERVENTION. AND THE PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING. NAVIGATION CENTERS TRIAGE CENTERS. ANY OTHER FORMS OVER EMERGENCY HOUSING. OUT REACH. WHAT WHATEVER IT TAKES THE ABILITY HAVE NAVIGATORS? ON THE GROUND TO HELP. A WITH THAT ASSERTIVE INTERVENTION. ALL THOSE PIECES THAT AREN'T. USUALLY THE SUBJECT OF A DISCUSSION OR DEBATE WHEN IT COMES FOR EXAMPLE TO. THE DEVELOPMENT OF A LARGE SCALE HOUSING BOND OR. BUT OUR ARE A NECESSARY PART OF THE CONTINUUM WE WANT THAT FLEXIBILITY. BUT WERE WILLING TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE IN TERMS OF THE RESULT THAT IT BRINGS. DID YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF LET ME FIRST START BY THANKING ALL OF YOU FOR. FOR YOUR PRESENTATION AND AS I SAID TO THE BIG TEN WHEN THEY'RE UP A COUPLE WEEKS AGO MINUS MERE STEINBERG WHEN I HAD A CHANCE TO SIT DOWN WITH THEM. AS THE CHAIR OF THE ASSEMBLY HOUSING COMMITTEE. WHAT YOU ARE SAYING DUB TELLS VERY MUCH WITH WHAT MANY OF US HAVE BEEN SO THE LEGISLATURE? WHICH IS WE NOT ONLY HAVE A HOUSING CRISIS BUT WE HAVE A AND THE MOST INTENSE HOMELESSNESS CRISIS REALLY IN OUR STATES. HISTORY AND ARE AS SOMEONE WHO IS A CO AUTHOR OF AB THIRTY ONE SEVENTY ONE I VERY MUCH SUPPORT THE SIZE OF THE MONEY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IN FACT I MIGHT SUGGEST. SINCE THE SENATE HAS A TWO BILLION DOLLAR PROPOSAL I THINK THE ASSEMBLY SHOULD HAVE A TWO BILLION DOLLAR PROPOSAL I HAVE SOME THOUGHTS ON. A WHERE ELSE WE OUGHT TO THINK ABOUT SPENT SPENDING MONEY IN THIS AREA. THAT BEING SAID I I THINK THAT THE QUESTION I'M REALLY INTERESTED IN. TO GET TO THE CHAIRS QUESTION IS IS HOW THIS MONEY IS GOING TO BE USED IN AND LET ME SAY THE FOLLOWING. AND I'M JUST NOW SPEAKING FOR SAN FRANCISCO WE SPEND ABOUT OVER THREE HUNDRED MILLION A YEAR ON HOMELESSNESS WE'VE BEEN SPENDING AT THAT LEVEL CORRECTED FOR. INFLATION OVER TIME FOR FOR QUITE SOME TIME AND THROUGH SEVEN MAYORS WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT DROP IN HOMELESSNESS IN FACT THE ONE PERCENT DROP THAT WE JUST HEARD. THAT WAS ACTUALLY HEROIC DROP COMPARED TO WHAT IS HAPPENING IN OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE. SO JUST ARE SITTING ALONE WE SPENT BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. AND YET WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO BRING HOMELESSNESS DOWN AND SO. I THINK FOR ME. THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF DISCUSSION ABOUT EVIDENCE BASED FACT BASED APPROACHES TO HOMELESSNESS I KNOW ALL THREE OF YOU KNOW. THE FIRST I HOUSING FIRST MODEL THE IMPORTANCE OF PERMITS SUPPORTIVE HOUSING AND. AND A DISCUSSION WE'RE HAVING ABOUT WHAT FOR CIVIL DOLLARS MEAN. IN A SOMEWHAT AT THIS MOMENT A BIT UNDEFINED WAY VERSES WANTING TO FOCUS ON. SUPPORT OF HOUSING AND LET ME SAY JUST TO BE CLEAR WHEN I REFERRED TO SUPPORT OF HOUSING I'M NOT NECESSARILY SAYING WE HAVE TO BUILD AND CONSTRUCT WITH THESE DOLLARS. BUT I THINK PAIN FOR OPERATING COSTS FOR THE ORGANIZATIONS THAT RUN THIS LONG TERM RENTAL ASSISTANCE THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN PROVEN OVER TIME. TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS AND AND I'VE NO DOUBT THAT WHAT I'M ALSO HEARING OF OTHER FLEXIBLE. SOLUTIONS WILL ALSO HELP BUT. MY QUESTION IS. HOW WE ARE I HEARD A LITTLE BIT FROM DISTRICTS THIS GIVE HOW WE WOULD SPEND? IN SAN FRANCISCO ARE THERE SPECIFIC PLANS FOR EACH OF THE CITIES ON HOW THEY WOULD SPEND SO THAT WE COULD JUST HAVE A SENSE OF OF THIS BECAUSE I HEAT AT THE END OF. A YEAR I APPRECIATE WE ALL HAVE TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE BUT I HATE TO SAY WE SPENT A BILLION AND A HALF AND OUR NUMBERS. HAVEN'T DROPPED NOW OR HAVEN'T DROPPED BY MORE THAN ONE PERSON SO LOVE TO JUST GET A LITTLE BIT MORE TO CENSOR OF THAT. SURE TO GO FIRST IN I HAVE SOME THOUGHTS THE HAPPY TO ON. THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES. ARE. I BUDGET THIS STARTS JULY ONE IS FOR FOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS ADDRESSING HOMELESSNESS. OF THAT TWO HUNDRED THIRTY EIGHT MILLION ARE OF THIS THROUGH THE BOND THE HHH BOND THAT WAS APPROVED. THE BALLOTS THOUGH IS FOR. RAPID RE HOUSING THE LOS ANGELES HOMELESS SERVICES AUTHORITY AND EXISTING. PROJECTS AND AGENCIES THAT WE WORK WITH. AS YOU STATED. YOU WE CAN PUT. MONEY IN VARIOUS PLACES BUT WHAT'S TURNING OUT BECAUSE OF THE IN FLOW AND BECAUSE. OF THAT. THE THE NEED. IT IS TO THE NEED TO BE ABLE TO DO IT ALL. AND TO BE ABLE TO DO IT ALL THAT HAS. AT THE SAME TIME BECAUSE. OF ALL OF THESE INTERVENTIONS ARE NEEDED. BOB BASED ON THE. FORMULA THAT WE USE THAT. BATES DID WHICH IS TIED TO THE PERCENTAGE OF HOMELESS POPULATION YOU HAVE IN EACH CITY. THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES PROJECTS THAT UNDER THIS FORMULA WE WOULD I RECEIVE APPROXIMATELY THREE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS. WE HAVE. LOOK CAREFULLY AT THE THINGS THAT WE NEED TO DO AND I'M HAPPY TO SHARE WITH YOU WHERE WE ARE NOW I MEAN IT IS THAT DRAFT BUT IT GIVES YOU A SENSE. OF THE DIRECTION WE'D LIKE TO TAKE. OF THAT THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY MILLION WE FIFTY MILLION OF IT TOO PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING GAPS BECAUSE AS YOU KNOW THE. ON TAX REFORM. CHANGE IT TAX REFORM WHICH IS APPROVED IT CHANGE THE VALUE IF YOU WILL OF THAT NINE PERCENT CREDITS IN THE LIKE THAT WE EACH HISTORICALLY USE THE CALL THAT I YOU OF THOSE. NOT BEING AS HIGH AND IN THE PAST WHICH CREATES THAT GAP BASED ON THE EXPECTATION OF THE FINANCING SO WE ANTICIPATE THAT IF WE WERE ABLE TO PUT. FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS AND ANTICIPATING THE GAPS THAT WILL COME UP BECAUSE OF THAT CHANGE THAT WE'D BE ABLE TO ADD ANOTHER TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY. ADDITIONAL UNITS OF SUPPORTIVE HOUSING. OUR TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE MILLION THOUGH THE LION SHARE OF IT WOULD GO TO TEMPORARY LEGAL ACTION CAN ASK WERE QUICKER QUESTION THERE BECAUSE. AYE I HEAR A LITANY OF OPTIONS BUT I'D I CAN GET IN MY HEAD WHETHER WE'RE TALKING ABOUT BUILDING. REMODELING SOMETHING OR JUST. MEAN EXACTLY WHAT WE TALKED WE HAVE TAUGHT THERE ACTUALLY FIFTY UNITS WERE TALKING. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FILLING GAPS FOR NEW CONSTRUCTION THAT'S WHAT I ASSUME FOR ONE LETTER THE FIFTY MILLION WOULD BE FOR THAT THAT. I TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY SEVENTY FIVE MILLION WAS IDENTIFIED FOR. TEMPORARY SHELTER NAVIGATION CENTERS. BRIDGE HOUSING MEETING EMERGENCY WE USED TO CALL IT TRANSITION BUT NO BUT BRIDGE HOUSING IN. AND THAT WOULD ADD FOUR THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY ADDITIONAL BETS AND THAT ALSO INCLUDE SOMETHING THAT WE'VE. BEEN DOING FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS NOW AND THAT'S MOBILE HYGIENE CENTERS. AND I HAVE TO SAY SOME OF THIS MODEL ARE MUCH OF THIS MODEL DOES COME FROM SAN FRANCISCO. INCLUDING OUR FORMER. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH SERVICES DIRECTOR. AND A BRILLIANT CORNERS THAT DOES THE. MASTER LEASING AS WELL AS. A LOT OF A MAY WHICH IS PROVIDES THAT. HI GENE CENTER IN THE TOILETS ON A MOBILE BASIS AND IT HAS MADE SUCH A TREMENDOUS DIFFERENCE FOR PEOPLE TO HAVE A SENSE OF DIGNITY AND KNOWING THAT. ONCE TWICE A WEEK THEY CAN GO TO AN APPOINTED SPOT AND KNOW THEY CAN GET WHAT WHAT THEY NEED IN TERMS OF HYGIENE. MISTER OBERNOLTE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR BUT NOT SO LIKE THE ABILITY TO DRESS OCEARCH IN THIS OP ED GO AHEAD FOR HIGH YIELD MY TIMES ARE GOING TO NOW. VISIT ONE OF THE. BUT I THINK IT. ALL OF THE BIG ELEVEN CITIES CERTAINLY. ARE IN THE PROCESS OF OF DOING THE EXACT. THE WORK THAT WE JUST HEARD TO ACTUALLY BREAK DOWN OUR NUMBERS BASED UPON THE ESTIMATED PERCENTAGE IN SO WE'RE HAPPY TO GET ALL OF THAT TO THE COMMITTEE. THE PART AND I DON'T THINK WE'VE EMPHASIZED ENOUGH THOUGH IN ANSWER TO YOUR YOUR. ASSEMBLYMEMBER CHIU YOUR QUESTION ABOUT HOW TO UE. CONSISTENTLY HOUSE MORE PEOPLE AND YET THE HOMELESS NUMBERS KEEP GOING UP I MEAN THAT'S THE. REAL CONUNDRUM HERE RIGHT THE PYRRHIC VICTORIES ARE THE HOUSE. SO MANY PEOPLE ONLY TO SEE THE PROBLEM NOT GET ANY BETTER. AND WHAT WE BELIEVE IS THE ANSWER AT LEAST PARTLY LIES IN HAVING THE FLEXIBILITY. TO SOME STATE RESOURCES ON THE PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION SIDE. IN OTHER WORDS THE PIPE THAT THE FOR THE FAMILY. SINGLE PARENT USUALLY THE SINGLE MOM. THIS THE INDIVIDUAL WHO HAVE IS ONE BROKEN DOWN CAR. ONE RENT INCREASE ONE LOST JOB. ONE INJURY. AWAY FROM GOING FROM BEING HOUSED. TO COUCH SURFING. TO. OVERCROWDED SHELTER. TO THE STREET. AND OF WE HAD SOME FLEXIBILITY AND THE ABILITY WITH THE RIGHT SORTS OF VERIFICATION TO. PREVENT SOMEBODY FROM. BECOMING. PART OF THAT NEW COHORT. WE THINK THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO SHOW A GREATER THAN ONE PERCENT NET DECREASE IN OUR CITY. IN TERMS OF THE ACTUAL NUMBERS WHEN IT COMES TO THE POINT IN TIME COUNT. I THINK YOU MISTER CHAIR US SAW OUR QUESTION ABOUT S. B. THREE LOW WHICH WE APPROVED LAST YEAR THAT. IS GOING TO PUT A FOUR BILLION DOLLAR BOND TO ADDRESS. ALMOST AS AN AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN FRONT OF VOTERS THIS YEAR AND I THINK OF HISTORY IS A GUIDE THE VOTERS WILL PROBABLY APPROVE THAT SO I WONDERED HOW THIS REQUEST FOR ONE AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS. AYE INTERFACES WITH THAT IS THIS IS THIS IS IN ADDITION COMPLEMENT OR REALLY AND I GUESS. BUT ONE TIME MONEY WE'RE NOT ASKING FOR ON GOING MONEY WHICH IS I KNOW ONE OF THE CONCERNS. FROM EVERYBODY IN THE LEGISLATURE BUT WHEN I WAS HERE FROM GOVERNORS AND FOR MEMBERS OF THE MINORITY PARTY BUT EVERYONE IS THAT. AND YOU MAKE LONG TERM OBLIGATIONS AND YOU KNOW IT NEVER THEN GOES AWAY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ONE TIME MONEY. SO THAT WE CAN PURCHASE THE WAREHOUSE. FOR THE TRIAGE CENTERS SO THAT WE CAN. SET UP A RENT STABILIZATION FUND. AND SO I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE A BIG DIFFERENCE IN ONE TIME MONEY FOR INFRASTRUCTURE FOR. EMERGENCY RESPONSE. AND ONGOING FUNDING. ALRIGHT PET BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S UNDERSTOOD THAT IS PROBABLY THE REQUEST IS IN ADDITION TO THAT YES. THE. AND I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH YOU THAT THIS IS A AN EPIDEMIC.-CRISIS THAT'S KIND OF EXISTENTIAL CRISIS THAT SPACE IN CALIFORNIA. WE'RE SEEING HOMELESSNESS IN PLACES WHERE WE'VE NEVER SEEN IT BEFORE. THE. PROBLEM THAT I HAVE IS IS JUST WONDERING IF WE'RE NOT. BEING OPEN TO ARE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT OUR CHANCES OF SOLVING THE PROBLEM AND A AND A IF I'M DOING THE MATH RIGHT AND IF YOU HAD JUST JUST THE MONEY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THIS YEAR THAT WERE BILLION DOLLARS. FOR THAT BOND AND THE ONE HALF BILLION DOLLARS IN THIS REQUEST TOGETHER AND THEN IF YOU. COMPARE THAT AGAINST THAT THE HIGH END OF THE RANGE THAT YOU MENTIONED WHICH IS AS MANY AS A HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND HOMELESS IN CALIFORNIA. ON ANY GIVEN NIGHT IF IF I'M GETTING MY ZEROS RIGHT THAT'S. AS A LITTLE OVER FORTY TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS PER HOMELESS. PERSON THIS YEAR THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SPENDING. AND THAT'S IN ADDITION THAT JUST THIS YEAR THAT'S THAT'S IN ADDITION TO YOU KNOW TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN WE HAD. ARE WE HEADED OUT ON A TWO BILLION DOLLAR PROPOSAL AND I'M SURE WE'LL BE SPENDING MORE IN FUTURE YEARS SIGH I JUST. CAN'T HELP BUT WONDERING IF WE'RE TAKING WE'RE GOING TO SIMPLE MINDED ABOUT THIS SUPER JUST OF THROWING MONEY AT THE PROBLEM ISN'T GOING TO FIX IT. IT'S REMINDS ME OF SOMEONE COMING TO THE DOCTOR AND THEY SAY DOCTOR THE HEADACHE AND THE DOCTOR SAYS WELL YOU HAVE A BRAIN TUMOR. BUT YOU KNOW THAT'S WHY YOU HAVE A HEADACHE BUT HERE LET ME PRESCRIBED SOME ASPIRIN YOU KNOW BECAUSE WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE. THE ROOT CAUSES OF HOMELESSNESS IN IT'S A COMPLEX AND MULTIFACETED PROBLEM IT'S IT'S NOT JUST THE AFFORDABILITY OF HOUSING CALIFORNIA BUT THERE'S A OF MENTAL HEALTH ASPECT OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE THERE'S SOME. TECHNOLOGICAL UNEMPLOYMENT THROWN IN THERE THERE'S OTHERS AGING ISSUES AND I JUST I I'M A LITTLE SKEPTICAL THE JUST THROWING MORE MORE MONEY AT THE PROBLEM WOULD. WHAT HELP I WONDER IF IS ANYONE TAKE A HOLISTIC LOOK AT THIS TO TRYING TO SIGN UP FOR IF WE? AS A SOCIETY IF WE IF WE PUT OUR FOOT DOWN SAID NO MORE. THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO ACCEPT HOMELESSNESS IS PART OF OUR SOCIETY WHAT WOULD THAT COST TO IMPLEMENT THAT IP HOUSING LAWS MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. SO MORE LONG TERM. MORE SO THAN IN EMERGENCY FOR FUNDING. AND FUNDING FROM KRETZ CRACK. AND IF I MAY I CAN SHOW YOU HOW WE WOULD GET TO FIFTY ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED TWENTY. ANGELENOS ASSISTED WITH THIS FORMULA AND THESE FUNDS BECAUSE WE HAVE BEEN. S. HOT LOOKING AT IT FROM A HOLISTIC. WE'VE LOOKED AT THE PREVENTION AND PARTICULARLY WITH. THAT THE KIND OF INFLOW THAT WE'RE ALL FACING. WE'RE ALSO LOOKING AT THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND THAT. JUST SORT OF. ALMOST DISCARDING OF HUMAN BEINGS ON THIS BY THE TIME THEY ARE LIVING YEARS ON THE STREET. AND AS I MENTIONED EARLIER WE THAT TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE MILLION WHICH SHOULD BE THE CORE OF WHAT WE GET THAT WOULD ADDRESS NAVIGATION CENTERS AND. TEMPORARY SHELTERS AND ITS SHELTER. MEANING. BRIDGE HOUSING. I TO DEFY HAVE HOUSING THAT STENOSIS ALTERED NOT WHERE YOU LEAVE AT NINE IN THE MORNING. AND YOU HAVE TO STAND IN LINE TO SEE IF THEY'LL BE A BET FOR YOU AT SIX. THIS IS. HOUSING THAT WHILE YOU'RE THEIR IT IS SURE YEAH YOUR PLACE TO LIVE. AND THAT'S AND THAT'S SOMEWHAT OF I'M. DEPARTURE FROM THE TRADITIONAL SHELTER. APPROACH. THE MOBILE HYGIENE SINNERS AND. ARE PROJECTS ON CITY OWNED PROPERTIES ANON SITES FOR PERMANENT. WE PROPOSED IN LOS ANGELES PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING SITES THAT STILL HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE ENTITLEMENTS WHY CAN'T WE PUT TEMPORARY HOUSING ON THOSE SITES. OUT THIRTY TWO MILLION FOR RAPID RE HOUSING WHICH GOES TO THE POINT ABOUT. PEOPLE WHO ARE RIGHT THERE ONE LITTLE THING AND ALSO EVEN IN THE COUNTY THEIR. FUNDING LEGAL SERVICES TO ASSIST SO THAT PEOPLE HAVE RESOURCES ARE THE HUMAN RESOURCES TO THAT. NEGOTIATE WITH LANDLORDS TERRORISM REALLY BUT I APPRECIATE THE ANSWER A AND I UNDERSTAND YOUR ANSWER THE QUESTION OF HOW YOU WOULD SPEND THE MONEY. IN THIS PROPOSAL BUT I WAS ASKING A DIFFERENT QUESTION OF WE KNOW WE DON'T HAVE A CHAIR TO SMALL THEY DON'T HAVE IT WE DON'T HAVE A CURE HERE SIR I MEAN REALLY. WITH ADDITIONAL CURE. WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ALL DO IS TO MAKE THE PROBLEM SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER AND HELP AS MANY HUMAN BEINGS BY THE WAY ALONG THE WAY? AT AS WE CAN BUT. THE FRUSTRATION. LIES IN. THAT THE FACT THAT THERE ISN'T A CURE BUT WE BELIEVE IN OUR CITIES. THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY BEGIN TO SEE A DOWNWARD TREND IF WE FOCUS ON BOTH PREVENTION. EARLY INTERVENTION AND THE ELEMENTS OF THE CONTINUUM OF CARE THAT WE HAVE DESCRIBED. THAT ARE PROVEN TO WORK IF ONLY WE HAVE THE CAPACITY TO BE ABLE TO. TO DO MORE. MARK I THINK WE'RE ON THE SAME TEAM HERE AND YEAH I JUST WHAT MAKES SURE THAT WERE. THAT WERE TAKING A HOLISTIC APPROACH TO THE PROBLEM AND NOT JUST THROWING MONEY AT KNOW THAT YET. CLINTON QUESTION FOR THE PANEL WE THINK IS THE APPROPRIATE BALANCE BETWEEN EMERGENCY AND LONG TERM HOUSING FUNDING. HER SWORD LIKE ALAN'S NAY I THINK IT DEPENDS ON THE COMMUNITY YOU KNOW QUITE FRANKLY. AND WHERE THEY ARE IN TERMS OF THEIR INVESTMENTS I THINK THE COUNTIES KNOW BEST WHERE TO PUT THOSE FUNDS BUT I WOULD LIKE TO ADD. BEING THAT HOMELESSNESS AYE ISN'T ONLY AFFECTING PEOPLE WHO ARE ON THE STREETS IT'S ALSO AFFECTING OUR OUR COMMUNITIES. WITH. HEPATITIS. WE'VE HAD OUTBREAKS OF OTHER DISEASES ENCAMPMENTS. THE CRIME ASSOCIATED WITH IT AND OTHER PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES SO I THINK I CAN SAN FRANCISCO. WE WOULD. WANT TO BE ABLE TO DEPLOY THE MONEY AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE SO WE WOULD WANT TO FOCUS ON EMERGENCY SHELTER. BECAUSE WE HAVE INVESTED MUCH EMERGENCY SHELTER FOR THE PAST FIFTEEN YEARS WE'VE BEEN INVESTING MOSTLY IN HOUSING OTHER COMMUNITIES MAY HAVE A DIFFERENT. APPROACH TO IT AND ALSO FOR US AS WE WANTED TO PLAY THE FUNDING AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE SO RATHER THAN TRYING TO BUILD MORE PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING MASTER LEASING OR USING. A RENT SUBSIDIES ARE THINGS THAT WE CAN I THINK ARE ARE CRITICAL FOR SAN FRANCISCO BUT IMAGINE THE SITUATION IS QUITE DIFFERENT AND IN SACRAMENTO IN LA. YOU KNOW HOW WE DO THIS FORMULA WISE. I THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE A BALANCE I RECOGNIZE A COUPLE THINGS THAT THERE ARE SOME PERMITS SUPPORTIVE HOUSING EFFORTS IN THE PIPELINE THAT NO PLACE LIKE HOME INITIATIVE WHICH. I HOPE THE LEGISLATURE WILL. SAID ESSENTIALLY POSITIVELY REFERENDA AND PUT ON THE BALLOT AND THAT'S TWO BILLION DOLLARS. YOU'VE GOT TO PROPOSITION. WE GET THE HOUSING BOND AND HAVE A LAST YEAR'S PRODUCERS ALL GREAT WORK BY THE WAY. THAT THAT IS THE BEGINNING THERE'S NEED FOR MORE PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING. BUT WE NEED. I MEAN TO REALLY MAKE AN IMPACT TO GET PEOPLE OFF THE STREET INTO TRUE. ONE FORMER KNOW THEIR OF TRIAGE. WE NEED HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS HERE STATEWIDE IN ORDER TO MAKE A REAL IMPACT AND CLOSER TO BILLION. THAT'S REALLY WHAT WE NEED. AND I AM I HOPE THAT IN THE COMBINATION. OF. HOWEVER THE SORTS OUT OF PLEA IN THAT SURPLUS IS LARGE. THAT JUNE THE CITIES AND THE COUNTIES THAT THERE CAN BE. I'M INAPPROPRIATE DIVISION AND BALANCE THAT GIVES US THOSE KINDS OF RESOURCES EARTHLY PANEL ATTORNEY NUMBERS OUT THERE THAT THAT REALLY THE INTERVENTION ON THIS AND HOMELESSNESS VERSES OF THE SEASON WITH MILLION. ALMOST LONGTIME THEIR NUMBERS THAT SHOW ALL YEAH. AND I CAN'T GIVE YOU THE EXACT NUMBERS UP BE HAPPY TO SEND THEM BUT THE. WHEN YOU INTERVENE WITH SOMEONE WHO. IS EITHER ABOUT TO BE HOMELESS OR HAS ONLY BEEN HOMELESS FOR SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME. THE NEED FOR THE EXTENSIVE SERVICES AND THE COST ASSOCIATED WITH THAT IS GREATLY REDUCED BECAUSE YOU ARE. SORT OF. CATCHING THEM AS THEY FALL AND WITH SUPPORT IN THE SHORT TERM. THEY CAN AND BECAUSE THE FACT IS IN LOS ANGELES WE PROBABLY HAVE AND THAT'S ONE OF THE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE A YEAR WHO CYCLE IN AND OUT OF HOMELESSNESS. MANY. AND MOST OF THEM SELF RESOLVE THEIR IN THEIR CAR COUPLE WEEKS AND THEN THERE'S THE PLACE THAT. BUT WHEN SOMETHING HAPPENS AND THEY CAN'T SELF RESOLVE THIS SOONER THAT THEY ARE. GIVEN ASSISTANCE. THE. CHEAPER IT IS TO HELP THEM. AND THE GREATER LIKELIHOOD THAT THEY WILL NOT. FALL BACK INTO HOMES. I WOULD JUST. ED PUT IT THIS WAY MAYBE TO USE AN ANALOGY THEY'RE GOING UNDERSTANDS THAT WE HAVE A STAGE FOR SYSTEM. RIGHT VULGATE CANCER. WHICH STATE FOR SYSTEM. AND WE SPEND BILLIONS TRYING TO CATCH OUR TAILS TO. ADDRESS THE FACT THAT WE HAVE AN INTERVENE. PRIOR TO STAGE FOR. IF SOMEBODY IS HOMELESS FOR THE FIRST TIME. OR HAS A FIRST MENTAL SERIOUS MENTAL HEALTH EPISODE AND WE INTERVENE AT THAT POINT. AND THERE HOMELESS FOR THREE DAYS INSTEAD OF. THREE YEARS. OR GOD FORBID THREE DECADES. THEY HAVE A MUCH BETTER CHANCE OF SUCCESS AND WE HAVE A MUCH BETTER CHANCE AT SAVING. OF THOSE EXPENSIVE RESOURCES ON THE BACK AND. CHIU. THANK YOU END UP I WANT TO THANK MAYOR STEINBERG FOR ARTICULATING. Y. THE FLEXIBILITY SUPPORT BECAUSE I THAT'S I THINK A QUESTION THAT MANY OF US HAVE BEEN GRAPPLING WITH AND I THINK YOU CLEARLY. PUT IT IT'S TOO IT'S TO FOCUS ON RECENTLY HOMELESS. FOLKS BECAUSE YOU THINK THERE'S A GOOD BANG FOR THE BUCK THERE WHICH I I I I WOULD TEND TO AGREE. I I THINK ONE OF THE CHALLENGES WERE ALL GRAPPLING WITH IS OF THE PERCENTAGE OF FOLKS WHO ARE HOMELESS THERE'S SUCH A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF CHRONICALLY HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS. FOR WHOM WE SPENT AN AWFUL LOT OF MONEY. TO. TO. ECHO MISTER OBERNOLTE IS POINT WE KNOW IF YOU'RE CHRONICALLY HOMELESS ON THE STREETS IT MAY COST US FORTY TO SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. BUT IF WE CAN GET THEM TO SUPPORT OF HOUSING WE COULD HAVE THAT NUMBER. A AND BE MUCH MORE COST EFFICIENT WITHOUT IN SUPPORT OF I THINK WHAT I AM OR WE ARE ALTERNATE RAP WITH THIS POLICYMAKERS IS WHAT IS WHAT IS THAT RIGHT BALANCE. AND MY COMMITTEE WE DID AN ANALYSIS OF OF AB THIRTY ONE SEVENTY ONE AND OF AND A FEW THINGS THAT WE HAD SUGGESTED ARE ONE. OF SPENDING MONEY ON THE HOUSING FOR HEALTHY CALIFORNIA PROGRAM WHICH IS THE ONLY STATE PROGRAM TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF TRULY CHRONICALLY HOMELESS. INDIVIDUALS THAT COHORT I JUST REFERRED TO WHO WOULD OTHERWISE BECAUSE THEY'RE IN AND OUT OF EMERGENCY ROOMS AND AND JAIL. AND AND JAIL FACILITIES IN MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. COST US AN AWFUL LOT MORE THAN WE WOULD IF WE COULD FIGURE OUT A WAY TO PUT A ROOF OVER THEIR HEADS. I ALSO IF YOU'RE UP TO ME I THINK A LARGE PORTION OF THAT MONEY EVEN THREE QUARTERS OF THAT FUNDING SHOULD GO TO MOVING CHRONICALLY HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS. INTO SUPPORT OF HOUSING IN A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT WAYS PUMP BUT THAT BEING SAID IF I'M OPEN AND IT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE FLEXIBILITY MEANS I THINK IT. I THINK THE MORE INFORMATION WE HAVE FROM THE BIG ELEVEN CITIES ABOUT EXACTLY WHAT THE PLANS ARE SO THAT YOUR. SO THAT WE CAN WE CAN TEST THAT BECAUSE I KNOW FOR EXAMPLE LOT OF THE STATE WHAT POLICY ADVOCATES. HAVE SEEN MANY MANY BUDGETS THROUGH MANY MANY POLITICIANS AND HAVE SEEN SOME PROGRAMS WORK IN SOME PROGRAMS NOT AND AND THERE. THERE'S A DESIRE TO HAVE TO SPEND MONEY WHERE WE KNOW THE DATA SHOWS IT'S GOING TO HAVE AN IMPACT AND YOU'RE PROPOSING. THAT THERE ARE NEW WAYS FOR US TO DO THAT WHICH VERY WELL COULD IMPACT THIS BUT I THINK IF WE KNOW THAT UP FRONT AND WE HAVE SOME METRICS UP FRONT THAT'LL. HELP MAKE EVERYONE FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE ABOUT. ABOUT WHERE THIS GOES FAIR POINT. MANTIS AB ABSOLUTELY THAT. THE MAYOR OF THE TOWN. THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES OF COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. TOTALLY AGREE AND THAT IS THE BEST PRACTICE AND THAT IS WHY. ONE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLAR BOND WAS PASSED. FOR A CHRONICALLY HOMELESS HOUSE PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING FOR CHRONICALLY HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS AND THEN THE PROB I MEASURE H. WAS TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES. THAT. POPULATION WHILE SO USE IT REPRESENTS AN INCREDIBLE INVESTMENT AN ONGOING INVESTMENT I THINK THAT'S WHY YOU HAVE THE OP. FUNDING FOR. THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT SAID AND ANY NUMBER OF IS THAT BECAUSE THERE IS THAT SAME AS WITH. A HOUSING FOR HEALTH AND IN THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES. WHAT WE ALSO? POINT OUT IS THAT THAT IS APPROXIMATELY THIRTY PERCENT OF THE HOMELESS POPULATION IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THAT THE OTHER. SIXTY SIX SEVENTY PERCENT OF THE POPULATION. ARE THOSE PEOPLE THAT ARE FALL IT BETTER IN THAT ARE HOMELESS. ARE NOT. NECESSARY AND ARE NOT CHRONICALLY MINT REGARDED AS CHRONICALLY MENTALLY ILL. BUT THE LONGER THEY ARE ON THE STREETS THE LONGER THE LID GREATER THE LIKELIHOOD THAT THEY WILL BECOME THAT. PORTION OF THE POPULATION THAT'S SO MUCH COSTLY. AND THAT. NOW. WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO NOT DO ONE OR THE OTHER BUT TO DO BOTH AND IT WE COULD TACKLE THIS TO STABILIZE IN A WAY WHERE THEN. WE WOULD BE ABLE TO. MORE ACCURATELY IDENTIFY SORT OF HOW MUCH GOES FOR CHRONICALLY HOMELESS VERSUS THOSE THAT ARE. THAT ARE SIMPLY HOMELESS BUT AT ANY EVENT IT'S SOMETHING WHERE THE INFLOW. HAS TO BE STEM IF WE'RE GOING TO MAKE ANY PROGRESS AND WHERE WE. AS THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD. CANNOT TURN AWAY. THANK YOU MISS CAMBIADO. I REALLY APPRECIATE THIS CONVERSATION BECAUSE I'M. FRANKLY. I DON'T HAVE ANY OF THAT. ELEVEN LARGEST CITY IN MY DISTRICT. SO I APPRECIATE YOU GUYS COMING FORWARD AND SAYING LOOK AT THIS IS WHAT WE THINK SHOULD HAPPEN BUT I'M GONNA NEED TO HEAR FROM MY CITIES THAT. BETTERS GRAPPLING WITH THIS AND. I'M STRUCK BY THE WHOLE IDEA PREVENTION. INTERVENTION OP BECAUSE THEY. IT DIDN'T REALLY WHAT THAT WITH THE PREVENTION INTERVENTION GETS TO IS THE WHOLE ISSUE OF WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH UNITS. AND THEY'RE NOT AFFORDABLE. AND SO EIGHT THAT THAT'S BEEN IN INTRACTABLE PROBLEM IN OUR COMMUNITIES AS YOU KNOW ANYTIME YOU START TALKING ABOUT BUILDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING OR EVEN A FACILITY FOR HOMELESS YOU GET TREMENDOUS RESISTANCE FROM THE COMMUNITY. AND I'VE BEEN WORKING ON A REGIONAL BASIS TO TRY TO JUST ON. STEMS SOME OF THE. SOME OF THE M.. HOMELESS. HOLDS THAT THERE ARE AND JUST BEING JUST TRYING TO GET OUT AND TALK TO PEOPLE ABOUT ALLOWING. UP DIFFERENT KINDS OF HOUSING IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOODS ARE IS JUST TERRIBLE I MEAN IT AT ITS NOBODY WANTS. ANYBODY NEAR THEM AND SO ON SO THE DIFFICULT OF DOING THAT PREVENTION INTERVENTION WORK IS IS GOING TO BE THERE AND IT AND IT'S TERRIBLY EXPENSIVE. SO I'M STRUGGLING WITH HOW YOU KNOW HOW IF YOU'RE GONNA GET RESOURCES AND ITS NEW RESOURCES HOW DO YOU SET UP THE ACCOUNTABILITY HOW DO YOU SET UP THE METRICS SO THAT. THEN EVEN RURAL AND SMALLER COMMUNITIES ARE UTILIZING THE SAME METHODOLOGY OR THE SAME SYSTEM OR SO THAT WERE ALL DOING THINGS IN A WAY THAT REALLY IS GOING TO REACH AN OUTCOME. SO THAT WE DON'T PUT. TWO TWO BILLION HER A BILLION DOLLARS OUT THE IN A YEAR AND THEN WE'RE IN THE EXACT SAME POSITION AND EVERYBODY COMES BACK THEN THEY REALLY THOUGHT THAT THAT WAS GOING TO DO IT FOR WHAT HERE BUT WE COULDN'T DO IT YOU KNOW I AM SAYING. SO WELL THAT I BUT I REALLY APPRECIATE THIS DISCUSSION BECAUSE I REALLY HADN'T FOCUSED ON THE. PREVENTION INTERVENTION PART OF IT WHICH IS WHICH IS THAT THAT'S A WHOLE ANALOGY OF PEOPLE. PEOPLE ARE STANDING AT THE RIVER AND THEY SEE BODIES FLOATING DOWN IN THERE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S GOING ON THERE. GOING AND PULLING THEM OUT IN THE SUMMER DECIDES TO GO UPRIVER TO FIND OUT HOW THEY'RE ENDING UP IN THE FOR IN THE RIVER IN THE FIRST PLACE AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT THE PREVENTION IS ALL ABOUT IS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. HOW DO WE KEEP PEOPLE FROM FALLING INTO HOMELESSNESS? AND I'VE BEEN TALKING TO A LOT OF PEOPLE AND THEY'RE THAT CLOSE. I HAD I HAD BOMB AND I KNOW THAT PEOPLE ARE SICK OF ME TELLING THIS TALE BUT I HAD A CONVERSATION WITH THE WOMAN WHO TOLD ME SHE WAS SCARED EMBARRASSED AND FINALLY ASHAMED. BECAUSE HER RENTED GONE UP A HUNDRED PERCENT IN FIVE YEARS. AND SHE WAS TWO INCOME EARNERS IN THEIR FAMILY AND THIS WAS IN SALINAS AND SHE SAID. I'M ASHAMED BECAUSE I'M AND WE MAY END UP HOMELESS AND I MAY HAVE TO TELL MY FAMILY AND THERE'S NO OTHER ALTERNATIVE AND. THEY'RE WORKING HOW DO YOU END UP HOMELESS WHEN YOU'RE WORKING AND NOT READ SO SO THE SITUATION IS IS YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE RIGHT. ONE PAYCHECK AWAY ONE. ACCIDENT ONE ILLNESS ONE. YOU KNOW INCREASE IN IN THE RENT AND SO WE GOT TO FIGURE OUT HOW THAT WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE BIG PICTURE IS THAT IN THAT I THINK THAT'S WHAT MISTER OBERNOLTE WAS GETTING TOO AND I AM A LITTLE FRUSTRATED BECAUSE. AFFORDABLE HOUSING BEEN MY NUMBER ONE ISSUE FOR THIRTY YEARS AND IT HASN'T GOTTEN ANY BETTER IN THE LAST THIRTY YEARS AND SO. APPRECIATE YOUR. YOUR ENERGY AND YOUR. HERE. YOU KNOW PUTTING ON PAPER WE THINK IS GOING TO WORK BECAUSE I WANT TO SEE IT HAPPEN THANK YOU. THANK YOU. MISTER CHOI. OKAY LET ME ADD A FEW. OF MY FRUSTRATIONS. AND FROM LISTENING TO OF THE PROBLEMS WE ALL KNOW THAT THAT THAT IS A VERY. A SERIOUS. A STATE ISSUE. I I FEEL LIKE A MORE THAN HALF OF MY TIME HERE AT THE. IN THE LEGISLATURE WE HEAR IS AFFORDABLE HOUSING AFFORDABLE HOSTING. AND THAT WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO DO IS. IF WE PROVIDE THE ENOUGH MONEY OR THE SOLUTION WOULD BE. IN A FOUND. BUT ALSO INTERESTING TO HEAR THAT. EMILY STUNNED BROKE SO. NOISE NOT PROMESAS. IT IS JUST THE IN. THERE'S NO NOT MUCH BETTER THERE'S A KNOCK KNOCK JUROR. WE ARE TRYING TO. AND MINIMIZE. THE IT EVEN IT'S ALSO IRONIC HERE AT THE STATE CAPITOL WE TALK ABOUT THIS SO. JUST ABOUT THE ON A DAILY BASIS BUT THAT JUST ACROSS THE STREET THE. YOU SEE RIGHT THERE HOMELESS PEOPLE. KNOW EVEN THOUGH YOU I'M MIGHT HAVE. REDUCE THAT NUMBER. IT IS SO FULL OF SHAME FOR US TO. YOU KNOW TAKE IT AS A. SERIOUS OUR ISSUE OF THE STATE LOCAL ISSUES. AT THE EVEN THAT THE KEPT THEIR CD WE CANNOT SOLVE THE PROBLEM. ARE AYE I HAVE A MAYBE. I THINK I THINK I CAN TALK HIM INTO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS I THINK ARE. WHEN WE HEAR PREVENTION AND INTERVENTION COR LISTED ALL KINDS OF GOOD WORDS. IN ALL MY WAY OF LOOKING AT THE PROBLEM IS SO. WE ARE TRYING TO. A PROVIDE I COME UP WITH SOME SOLUTIONS SO TO THE PROBLEM BUT THE. IS TO MORE THAN PREVENTION WHAT INTERVENTION Y. SUCH A PROBLEM. IS SUPPOSED TO STING AND THE INCREASING. NOT DECREASING I KNOW THIS IS A NOT US IMPROVE. ANSWER. OF HOWEVER. WHY DID IT BECOME THE YOU KNOW HOMELESS? WITH NO MONEY RIGHT. WHY NO MONEY NO JOBS? WHY NO JOBS? BECAUSE OF THE ONGOING PROCURER SO TOOL WE KNOW WHO MAY. ARE HIRE THEM. EVEN THOUGH WE WE DO SEE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE COST DOWN. AS YOU ARE KNOWN A WILL CALIFORNIA IS SO KNOWN AS A NOTORIOUS. BUSINESS REGULATIONS AND THE BUSINESSES HER PACKING UP AND LEAVING. LAST SO WHAT THE ABOUT A DECADE OR SO NINE THOUSAND SOMETHING BIG BUSINESSES HAVE LEFT. SO THOSE OF BUSINESS OF WHEN THEY ARE IN A BUSINESS BIG BUSINESS OF LEAVE WHAT THEY LEAVE OUT WITH THE TOPS OF. AND SO WHAT. NO THOSE ARE THE DIRECTLY. COORDINATED ISSUES. AND A GOOD JOB SO WE NEED TO CREATE THE AND WE NEED TO FOSTER. IT I FOR EXAMPLE. OUTPUT A SECOND TIME OUR I INTRODUCED ARE A BIT OF. A WHICH I NAMED SL Y. COME BUSINESS OF BACK TO CALIFORNIA. IF YOU CREATE THIS YEAR IT PASTOR REVENUE AND TAXATION COMMITTEE YESTERDAY. A IF YOU BRING BACK A. YOUR JOB YOU YOUR BUSINESS TO CALIFORNIA WITH A TWENTY ONE MORE PEOPLE WILL GIVE YOU A SEVENTEEN POINT FIVE PERCENT. BUT A TAX CREDIT. AND OR IF YOU EAT EXISTING BUSINESSES SO HERE IN CALIFORNIA IF YOU EXPAND THE* MORE FULL TIME EMPLOYEES WILL GIVE YOU A TAX CREDIT. WHAT I'M? I'VE BEEN TRYING TO DO WAS TALK TO FOSTER I CANNOT AS TO MINORITY MEMBER I NO I CANNOT UNDO THE EXISTING. OUR REGULATIONS. SO WHAT I'M TRYING TO DO WAS SET TO CREATE THE MORE JOBS. YOU KNOW BY FOSTERING ON THE BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT THAT THAT'S WHAT I'VE BEEN DOING SO I THINK APPLAUSE OF THE DEEP MORE COMPREHENSIVE THINGS SO WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT THE. WHEN WE TRY TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM THAT WE CREATE THAT PROBLEM. BEGIN WITH. LOOK THAT DUST OF FRUSTRATION INSIDE. OF ME. OKAY THAT'S MY. DUFF VENTING MY FRUSTRATION HERE'S MY QUESTION. ONE OF YOU CITIES. FOR ALL. ARE. SOME FRANCISCO WERE LA OR SACRAMENTO. WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO. WORK A CREATE OF PROFIT. PUBLIC PARTNERSHIP. OUR FOR STARVING THOUGH ON HOMELESSNESS ISSUES THAT THERE WAS SOMEONE. A BUSINESSMAN WHO APPROACHED ME FROM A CHINA. HE. ONE HIS ARE LOOKING FOR A CITY OR LOCAL GOVERNMENT TAP OR. WHAT TONY? THAT THE GIVING THEM AUTHORITY AND THAT GIVING THE PARTNERSHIP FOR. IF HE WERE TO SOLVE ALL THE PROBLEMS SO WE FEEL LESS THAN THIRTY PERCENT OF THE GOVERNMENT OR WOULD HAVE COST. AND WITH THAT ARE I THINK THAT ONE OF TWO CONDITIONS. IS SELF. HELPING THEM FIND THE ZONING PLAYER. THE FACILITIES AT THAT HOUSING CAN BE PLACED. AND THE BUILDING PROMISE WOULD BE EXPEDITED. AND THEN EDUCATION ISSUES HEALTH ISSUES TO MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES OF WHATEVER EDUCATION ISSUE SO THEY WERE. ARMED DEPARTMENT. THE DEPARTMENT ALISA AND THEN HELP THEM. SO I THINK THIS IS SO IT GREEK IDEA GOVERNMENT TRIED THAT CASE TO HAVE TRIED AND TRIED THE IT HAS NOT WORKED. HAS ANYBODY APPROACH. THAT THE PROBLEM THE PUBLIC PARTNERSHIP APPROACH IF YOU HAVE NOT THE WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO LISTEN AND TALK TO THE PERSON. THAT AFFECTS ONE MAKING PROFITS DOT BEFORE ON THE BACKS OF HOMELESSNESS IS IS THE CORRECT METHOD FOR THIS. AND YOU TALK ABOUT THE. EARLY SADISM. JOBS OBVIOUSLY MINIMUM WAGE JOBS IS NOT A FAVORITE AS A BIG ISSUE CALIFORNIA TREE LA JOBS BUT MINIMUM WAGE JOBS DON'T PAY RATE WILL NOT BY YOU HOUSE. SO I I THINK YOU KNOW THE BIG GREAT PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS IN CERTAIN AREAS BUT FOR HOMELESSNESS AYE AYES YOU KNOW WHERE HE IS THE ONLY THING OF IT WHEN YOU REALLY THINK ABOUT IT. THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY TO COMBAT HOMELESSNESS IS HROUGH FORM OF PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP BECAUSE THE COUNTIES THEMSELVES GENERALLY. DO NOT RUN THE PGA OR THE CITIES DON'T ACTUALLY RUN THE PROGRAMS. WE ACTUALLY WORK WITH. MOSTLY NON PROFIT BUT THERE ARE A FEW FOR PROFIT PROVIDERS WHO HAVE THE EXPERTISE. AND HOW TO. AND HOW TO HELP THE POPULATION THE WAY IS ACTUALLY THE CAPACITY. BUILD OF THE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS. THAT I SUPPOSE COULD INCLUDE. A FOR PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS THAT THAT THAT DID THAT WORK. BUT WITHOUT THE THE INFUSION OF PUBLIC INVESTMENT. WE HAVE NOTHING TO OFFER. THE PRIVATE SECTOR IF YOU WILL OR THE NONPROFIT SECTOR TO BE ABLE TO DO ONE OF THE WORKS I THINK THERE'S OF IP INTEREST IN THE CONVERSATION. OKAY YOU KNOW. AT JUST WHY NOT NOW THERE COULD BE A COOK THERE COULD BE A KERNEL OF SOME THEIR. THOUGHT WE WOULD BE INTERESTED AS WELL AND WE'RE CURRENTLY EXPLORING. CREDIT TENANT LEASE FINANCING MODEL. IN WHICH THE PRIVATE SECTOR COULD CONSTRUCT. AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAT COULD THEN BE LEAST BACK. BY THE COUNTY. IN ORDER TO CUT CONSTRUCTION COSTS AND THE AMOUNT OF TIME IT TAKES TO BUILD HOUSING SO WE'RE CURRENTLY LOOKING AT AT ALTERNATIVE MODELS AND WOULD BE HAPPY TO. HAVE CONVERSATIONS WITH WITH ANYONE WHO'S GOT I KNOW ALREADY HAPPY TO MAKE THAT TO PREACH. AND AND AND NOT BASED UPON OUR WHAT I'VE READ HERE IS SUCH TRYING TO GET RID OF OUR. NOW FAITH THE BASTER COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS ARE I MEAN AND TO ME IT THIS HAS SO WRONG IN OUR APPROACH TO SOMEONE'S CENTER. NOW THE HOUSING FIRST OR WHAT WOULD SOLVE ALL THE PROBLEMS SO ONE ENTITY GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN TRYING TO DO THAT THOUGH IT WOULDN'T IT WILL IT DIDN'T WORK. SO I THINK THAT THERE ARE E. EITHER. THE DOUG LA EACH A PRIVATE PUBLIC PARTNERSHIP OFF FACE OF FAITH BASED A SMALL ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS SO FAR IT HAS SO. IT AT LEAST THAT THEY HELPED. A IN COUNSELING FROM THE BEGINNING IN A BEFORE THEY UP RUN INTO A AT THEM MENTAL ISSUES SO WHY WHITE MEN MENTAL. HEALTH THE BECOME SUCH A ISSUE. AND I WOULD GO CRAZY IF I DON'T HAVE MONEY AND THE MY FAMILY WOULD END UP ON THE STREET. AMID THE METAL HALF THE WOULD DISAPPEAR WHEN THEY'RE SO NO MONEY A I CAN THEM MET MENTAL HEALTH OR BE AFFECTED. SO I I THINK WE NEED TO. WORK WITH THE INSTEAD WITH GETTING VETO BY A COMMITTEE BASED OF BASED ORGANIZATION SO WE NEED TO WORK WITH THEM. IN A WRITTEN MANY WASTED BECAUSE A GOVERNMENT THAT CANNOT SOLVE ALL THE PROBLEMS BY HIRING AND NUMBER OPAL AND NOT GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES. THAT'S MY. YOU KNOW TO SENSE REGULATORY THIS POINT WILL OPEN UP FOR PUBLIC COMMENT AND WE WOULD NEVER HAVE TO GET BACK TO CITY HALL FOR A COUNCIL MEETING HIS HEAD OKAY THANK YOU MISTER MAYOR PROPITIATE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND. BUT IS VERY GOOD THANK YOU HAS ALSO PHOTO NUMBER STICKERS SO PLEASE KEEP YOUR COMMENTS BRIEF IT IS OKAY SAY ME TOO. FED A LOT OF DISCUSSION HERE SO ALONG THE MORE MEMBERS HERE SO. BEVERLY. I APPRECIATED THAT THIRTY SECONDS MISTAKE HERE. STEVE CREWS ON BEHALF THE CITY OF SAN JOSE AND MAYOR SAM LICCARDO I KNOW HE WAS HERE A FEW WEEKS AGO ALONG WITH. MAYOR STEINBERG MAKING THE ROUNDS IN SUPPORT OF THIS FUNDING REQUEST. IS THE THIRD LARGEST CITY IN CALIFORNIA. LARGEST IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA THE CITY OF SAN JOSE EXPERIENCE IN HIS ITS FAIR SHARE OF HOMELESSNESS OVER FIVE THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS EXPERIENCE HOW MUCH EACH DAY. SO WE ARE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS REQUEST WE THINK AND WE AGREE WITH SENATORS AB. MAYOR STEINBERG IN TERMS OF THE FLEXIBILITY THE FUNDING AND ALSO ENSURING THAT WE WORK WITH OUR OUR COUNTY PARTNERS. ON THIS IN THIS EFFORT AND SO AGAIN WE. OUR STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU MISTER MAYOR YOU MISTER DRUCE. HIGH AND ARMY COLONEL WITH THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES AND WE OWE THEM ARE SUPPORTIVE IF AMENDED OF THE PROPOSAL FOR ASSEMBLY MEMBER TEENS DEL BECAUSE WE BELIEVE COUNTIES ARE PARTNERS WITH CITIES ON ALL OF THIS. AND IT'S INTERESTING THAT YOU HAVE LA AND SAN FRANCISCO HERE BECAUSE SAN FRANCISCO IS A CITY AND COUNTY AND LA HAS ANIMAL YOU WITH THEIR COUNTY THE CITY OF LA HAS MEMO YOU WITH THEIR COUNTY. TO PROVIDE THESE SERVICES AND SO THEIR PARTNERSHIPS ARE WHAT MAKE THEM SO SUCCESSFUL IN WHAT THEY'RE DOING. SEES ACT HAS AND A PROPOSAL WHICH WOULD BE TO PUT ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO NO PLACE LIKE HOME IF THERE'S A SURPLUS AS WELL IS. BUILDING ON THEM PUTTING MONEY INTO THE MULTI FAMILY HOUSING PROGRAM BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THE LONG TERM SOLUTION IS IMPORTANT. BUT THE EMERGENCY SHELTER PIECE IS IMPORTANT TOO THERE'S A CONTINUUM AND SO WE JUST DON'T THINK THAT A BILLION DOLLARS SHOULD GO TO CITIES TO DO EMERGENCY SERVICES. WE FEEL THAT THERE SHOULD BE A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN COUNTIES AND CITIES TO GET ALL OF THIS DONE INTO THAT ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM VALUE. NICHOLAS DELUDE A HERE WE HAVE OAKLAND MAYOR LIBBY SHAFT IN SANTA ANA MAYOR MIGUEL PULIDO IN STRONG SUPPORT I JUST TELL YOU A WHAT'S GOING ON IN OAKLAND IS ABSOLUTELY HEARTBREAKING. THREE APPRECIATE YOUR TIME AND IN DISCUSSING THIS IN YOUR CONSIDERATIONS OF THANK YOU AND YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON SHARON REPORT WITH THE CORPORATION FOR SUPPORT OF HOUSING I WERE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT. AND SUPPORT BOTH. ASSEMBLY MEMBER TINGS PROPOSAL AS WELL AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER TWO. I WE DO THINK THE LEGISLATURE HAS A ROLE IN ENSURING A BALANCED APPROACH AND OF FOR FUNDING PROGRAMS THAT ARE. PROVEN SOLUTIONS TO HOMELESSNESS WHICH REALLY IS LONG TERM HOUSING. NOT JUST FOR PRODUCTION BUT ALSO FOR RENTAL ASSISTANCE TO GET PEOPLE OFF THE STREET AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AND WITH LANDLORD INCENTIVES. AND WITH OPERATING SUBSIDIES TO. FUNDS AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECTS IN THE PIPELINE TO MAKE AFFORDABLE TO PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS ALL THREE OF THOSE SPEAKERS. REPRESENT CITIES WHO ARE DOING THIS ALREADY THERE ARE INVESTING HEAVILY AND AND A LONG TERM HOUSING SOLUTIONS THE VAST MAJORITY OF CITIES. THEIR BIGGEST MISSING GAP IS PERMANENT HOUSING FUNDING. SO WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE SOME INSURANCE ABOUT BAD IS GOING TO BE WHAT'S FUNDED THANK YOU HOME. I WOULD JUST MENTION REAL QUICKLY STATES THAT HAVE REDUCE. HOWEVER HOMELESSNESS FOR THEIR MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS INCLUDING CHRONICALLY HOMELESS PEOPLE. HAVE SEEN MEASURABLE RESULTS WE HAVE FORTY TWO PERCENT OF THE NATION'S CHRONICALLY HOMELESS POPULATION IN CALIFORNIA THIRTY EIGHT PERCENT OF THE NATION'S HOME HOMELESS YOUTH POPULATION. WE THINK THERE SHOULD BE SOME ATTENTION PAID TO THOSE TWO POPULATIONS THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS SUGGEST RILEY CALIFORNIA CITIES I KNOW YOU AS OUR BRIEF SO I ONLY HAVE TEN POINTS TO MAKE. I'M JUST KIDDING. JEW THINGS I WOULD LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT ONE THE FUNDS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE I'M MORE FUNDS AUGMENTS SERVICES OF COUNTIES REALLY AREN'T PROVIDING AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. INTO. THAT THE FUNDS WERE SEEKING A WILL WILL GET ALL CITIES THAT ARE TACKLING THIS ISSUE SO IT'S NOT JUST THE BIG ELEVEN YOU KNOW WE APPRECIATE THEIR LEADERSHIP. THEM STRONG ADVOCATES BUT IT'S FOR ALL CITIES THAT ARE THERE TACKLE THIS VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE THANK THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS. HERE ON BEHALF MORE TOP HERE ON BEHALF OF. IN HIGH MAYOR TOM TAPE AND SAN DIEGO MAYOR KEVIN FAULCONER WE JOIN AYE OUR FELLOW AT BIG ELEVEN MAYORS. IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS INITIATIVE APPRECIATE THE TIME YOU'VE GIVEN WITH US. TODAY AND I I THINK JUST TO FIND POINTS TO PUT ON AGREEING WITH EVERYTHING THAT ASSEMBLY BEEN SAID TODAY BUT ONE IN TERMS OF FLEXIBILITY. FLEXIBILITY ALSO MEANS. AND. UNDERSTANDING AND GIVING FLEXIBILITY FOR ALL THE VARIOUS AREAS OF THE STATE FOR EXAMPLE SAN DIEGO HAS ONE OF THE LARGEST VETERAN POT VETERAN HOMELESS POPULATIONS. AND SO WHAT WE OFFER TO VETERANS IS GOING TO BE DIFFERENT THAN PERHAPS WHAT'S OFTEN TO OFFERED IN SAN FRANCISCO SO THAT'S FLEXIBILITY. AND THEN SECONDLY I KNOW WE ALL KNOW THIS BUT JUST TO. HIGHLIGHT THIS IS A MATCHING PROGRAM SIR FOR EVERY DOLLAR THAT WE'RE ASKING THE STATE TO PUT IN. DAHLE ADD ONE DOLLAR WOULD ALSO BE PUT IN BY THE LOCALS AND SO WE THINK THAT'S A GOOD BANG FOR YOUR BUCK AND VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR TIME THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON CAN LOW'S REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA COALITION FOR YEAR THAT I REALLY APPRECIATE TODAY'S DISCUSSION AROUND HOMELESSNESS AND WHICH IS NOW WOULD REALLY LIKE TO SEE SOME DEDICATED RESOURCES TOWARDS HOMELESS YOU. I'M IT IS A ON SHELTER POPULATION FOR THE MOST PART ABOUT EIGHTY THREE PERCENT OF YOU CAN CALIFORNIA ARE AND SHELTERED. LAST STATEWIDE SURVEY IN TWO THOUSAND AND TEN I GET A LITTLE BIT OLD BUT ONLY TWENTY OF THE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES AT THAT TIME HAD SERVICES AT ANY TIME FOR YOU. AND I COULD HAVE BEEN ONE BAD. AND SO MORE TALKING ABOUT CITY SPECIFIC WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT RESOURCES IN GENERAL FOR YOUTH EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS AND I'VE SEEN US STATISTIC AROUND. FIFTY PERCENT OF THE CHRONIC ADULTS EXPERIENCE HOMELESSNESS WHEN THEY WERE EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY FOUR SO IF WE REALLY WANT TO GET UP AT PREVENTION AND INTERVENTION. TARGETING RESOURCES THAT YOUTH IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THANK YOU THANK YOU. TYRONE BUCKLEY ON BEHALF OF HOUSING CALIFORNIA WE ARE ALSO VERY SUPPORTIVE OF AN INVESTMENT FROM THE SURPLUS GOING TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS UNLIKE MANY OF THE SPEAKERS HERE TODAY SAID ALL OF THE DIFFERENT STRATEGIES NEED TO BE EMPLOYED SO WE WANT TO SEE THIS PROPOSAL BE REFLECTIVE OF. NOT JUST EMERGENCY HOUSING BUT ALSO RENTAL ASSISTANCE ALSO PERMITS SPORT OF HOUSING ON TOP OF THAT WE THINK ANY SPENDING THAT COMES OUT THE BUDGET THIS YEAR SHOULD ALSO INCLUDE. SOME FUNDING FOR HOMELESS YOUTH PROGRAMS THANK YOU YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON ON LAWLER WITH THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY AND ECHO THE COMMENTS THAT MY COLLEAGUE FROM HOUSING CALIFORNIA JUST MADE A WE DO WANT TOMAKE SURE THAT WE STRIKE THE APPROPRIATE BALANCE BETWEEN SHORT TERM EMERGENCY SOLUTIONS AND. THE LONGER TERM SOLUTIONS SUCH AS PERMITS PART OF HOUSING AND RENTAL ASSISTANCE THAT WE KNOW THAT THE ONLY WAY THAT WE'RE EVER GOING TO REDUCE THE RATE OF CONFLICT CHRONICLE MOST IN CALIFORNIA THINKS IF YOU. OR IN HIGGINS REPRESENT CALIFORNIA HOUSING CONSORTIUM WE ALSO SUPPORT A SIGNIFICANT ON INVESTMENT BY THE STATE OF THE SURPLUS AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND HOMELESS SERVICES. I WANT TO ECHO THE COMMENTS OF MY LAST TWO COLLEAGUES AND. SUPPORT THE INCLUSION OF A RANGE OF SERVICES INCLUDING PERMANENT HOUSING THANK YOU BUT YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS SYLVIA SOLELY SHAUN BEHALF THE CITY OF SANTA MONICA. WE BELIEVE THAT CITIES ARE BEST POSITIONED TO UNDERSTAND BUT LOCAL RESOURCES ALREADY EXIST HOW BEST TO UTILIZE THEM AND WHAT DEFICIENCIES CURRENTLY EXIST IN LOCAL RESPONSE EFFORTS. AS WE ARE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS PROPOSAL AND ASK FOR YOUR FAVORABLE CONSIDERATION THANK YOU THANK YOU. OR TAKE THE PANEL FIRST WELCOMING APPEAR TESTIFYING WITH IT HAD SOME. VERY INFORMATIVE. DEBATE AND ALSO THANK CHAIRMAN TING FOR COMING HERE THAT INCLUDES OUR HEARING THANKS HAVE A GREAT DAY
