IF WE MEET THAT ARE SCENARIO. A

00:33:39.985 --> 00:33:43.522 region:rollup2
WE WILL FULLY SATISFY THE NEEDS

00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:44.723 region:rollup2
OF A WITH AN ECONOMY THAT IS

00:33:43.522 --> 00:33:46.124 region:rollup2
INCREASINGLY DEMANDING MORE

00:33:44.723 --> 00:33:48.093 region:rollup2
HIGHLY SKILLED AND HIGHLY

00:33:46.124 --> 00:33:49.761 region:rollup2
EDUCATED WORKERS AND. MORE IN AN

00:33:48.093 --> 00:33:51.129 region:rollup2
INCREASINGLY REWARDING THEM

00:33:49.761 --> 00:33:53.632 region:rollup2
ECONOMICALLY.

00:33:51.129 --> 00:33:54.900 region:rollup2
AND THE TOTAL DIFFERENCE

00:33:53.632 --> 00:33:56.701 region:rollup2
BETWEEN THESE TWO LINES OVER

00:33:54.900 --> 00:33:58.703 region:rollup2
THIS ENTIRE A TIME FRAME IS

00:33:56.701 --> 00:34:00.005 region:rollup2
ABOUT ONE POINT ONE. MILLION

00:33:58.703 --> 00:34:01.439 region:rollup2
DEGREES SO THAT'S THAT'S THE

00:34:00.005 --> 00:34:02.707 region:rollup2
DEGREE GAP.

00:34:01.439 --> 00:34:03.975 region:rollup2
SO LET'S TURN TO THE NEXT SLIDE

00:34:02.707 --> 00:34:06.211 region:rollup2
THIS IS ON PAGE THREE OF YOUR

00:34:03.975 --> 00:34:08.246 region:rollup2
HANDOUT.

00:34:06.211 --> 00:34:09.481 region:rollup2
AND THE GOOD NEWS AND NOT SO

00:34:08.246 --> 00:34:11.283 region:rollup2
GOOD NEWS MAYBE IT IS THAT

00:34:09.481 --> 00:34:13.018 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA HAS A LOT OF ROOM FOR

00:34:11.283 --> 00:34:14.653 region:rollup2
IMPROVEMENT SO WHILE THOSE A

00:34:13.018 --> 00:34:16.354 region:rollup2
DEGREE GOALS ARE AMBITIOUS.

00:34:14.653 --> 00:34:17.289 region:rollup2
THERE ARE A LOT OF STUDENTS IN

00:34:16.354 --> 00:34:18.823 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA THAT WANT TO GO TO

00:34:17.289 --> 00:34:20.225 region:rollup2
COLLEGE.

00:34:18.823 --> 00:34:22.494 region:rollup2
AND UNLIKE SOME OTHER STATES

00:34:20.225 --> 00:34:24.029 region:rollup2
WHERE POPULATIONS ARE DECLINING.

00:34:22.494 --> 00:34:26.031 region:rollup2
AND SOME COLLEGES ARE HAVING

00:34:24.029 --> 00:34:27.766 region:rollup2
TROUBLES ENROLLING STUDENTS THAT

00:34:26.031 --> 00:34:29.434 region:rollup2
TENDS NOT TO BE THE CASE IN

00:34:27.766 --> 00:34:30.302 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA AND CERTAINLY IS NOT

00:34:29.434 --> 00:34:32.404 region:rollup2
THE CASE FOR OUR PUBLIC

00:34:30.302 --> 00:34:33.972 region:rollup2
INSTITUTIONS.

00:34:32.404 --> 00:34:35.507 region:rollup2
I SAW THIS CHART IS SHOWING YOU

00:34:33.972 --> 00:34:38.009 region:rollup2
THIS PIPELINE FROM NINTH GRADE

00:34:35.507 --> 00:34:39.644 region:rollup2
THROUGH TO A COLLEGE DEGREE AND

00:34:38.009 --> 00:34:41.413 region:rollup2
SO OUT OF. ONE THOUSAND NINE

00:34:39.644 --> 00:34:42.948 region:rollup2
GRADES IN CALIFORNIA YOU SEE HOW

00:34:41.413 --> 00:34:43.882 region:rollup2
MANY WILL END UP GRADUATING FROM

00:34:42.948 --> 00:34:45.850 region:rollup2
HIGH SCHOOL.

00:34:43.882 --> 00:34:47.352 region:rollup2
AND THEN FINALLY AT THE FAR

00:34:45.850 --> 00:34:48.653 region:rollup2
RIGHT IS HOW MANY WILL

00:34:47.352 --> 00:34:49.888 region:rollup2
EVENTUALLY EARNED A BACHELOR'S

00:34:48.653 --> 00:34:51.890 region:rollup2
DEGREE SO OUT OF THOSE ONE

00:34:49.888 --> 00:34:53.525 region:rollup2
THOUSAND NINTH GRADERS. WE HAVE

00:34:51.890 --> 00:34:54.292 region:rollup2
A LITTLE OVER THREE HUNDRED OF

00:34:53.525 --> 00:34:55.794 region:rollup2
THEM WILL EVENTUALLY EARNED A

00:34:54.292 --> 00:34:57.295 region:rollup2
BACHELOR'S DEGREES AT TODAY'S

00:34:55.794 --> 00:34:58.863 region:rollup2
COLLEGE GOING ON COLLEGE

00:34:57.295 --> 00:35:00.999 region:rollup2
COMPLETION RATES.

00:34:58.863 --> 00:35:01.466 region:rollup2
THAT THE GOOD NEWS THAT AS WE

00:35:00.999 --> 00:35:03.568 region:rollup2
HAVE A LOT OF ROOM FOR

00:35:01.466 --> 00:35:04.769 region:rollup2
IMPROVEMENT. AND THE OTHER PIECE

00:35:03.568 --> 00:35:06.705 region:rollup2
OF GOOD NEWS I WOULD SAY IS WE

00:35:04.769 --> 00:35:08.540 region:rollup2
DO HAVE A LARGE NUMBER STUDENTS

00:35:06.705 --> 00:35:10.275 region:rollup2
WHO DO MAKE THE TRANSITION FROM

00:35:08.540 --> 00:35:12.110 region:rollup2
HIGH SCHOOL TO COLLEGE AND

00:35:10.275 --> 00:35:13.578 region:rollup2
YOU'LL SEE THAT THERE WE HAVE.

00:35:12.110 --> 00:35:14.946 region:rollup2
EIGHT HUNDRED TWENTY THREE HIGH

00:35:13.578 --> 00:35:16.481 region:rollup2
SCHOOL GRADUATES OUT OF THAT

00:35:14.946 --> 00:35:17.582 region:rollup2
INITIAL ONE THOUSAND COHORT OF

00:35:16.481 --> 00:35:19.050 region:rollup2
NINTH GRADERS.

00:35:17.582 --> 00:35:20.552 region:rollup2
TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY TWO WILL

00:35:19.050 --> 00:35:22.187 region:rollup2
ATTEND A FOUR YEAR COLLEGE

00:35:20.552 --> 00:35:23.655 region:rollup2
WITHIN TWELVE MONTHS OF

00:35:22.187 --> 00:35:25.323 region:rollup2
GRADUATING FROM HIGH SCHOOL.

00:35:23.655 --> 00:35:26.524 region:rollup2
THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY TWO WILL

00:35:25.323 --> 00:35:28.493 region:rollup2
ATTEND A COMMUNITY COLLEGE SET

00:35:26.524 --> 00:35:30.261 region:rollup2
ALTOGETHER THAT'S ABOUT SIX

00:35:28.493 --> 00:35:31.296 region:rollup2
HUNDRED AND FORTY SIX OUT OF

00:35:30.261 --> 00:35:33.531 region:rollup2
THAT EIGHT HUNDRED AND TWENTY

00:35:31.296 --> 00:35:34.966 region:rollup2
THREE ARE GOING ON TO COLLEGE.

00:35:33.531 --> 00:35:36.601 region:rollup2
SO THERE'S A LOT OF ROOM THERE.

00:35:34.966 --> 00:35:37.902 region:rollup2
TO IMPROVE COLLEGE COMPLETION

00:35:36.601 --> 00:35:39.471 region:rollup2
JUST AMONG THOSE WHO HAVE

00:35:37.902 --> 00:35:40.672 region:rollup2
ALREADY SUCCESSFULLY MADE THE

00:35:39.471 --> 00:35:42.674 region:rollup2
TRANSITION TO COLLEGE.

00:35:40.672 --> 00:35:44.209 region:rollup2
NOTABLY CALIFORNIA RANKS FORTY

00:35:42.674 --> 00:35:45.343 region:rollup2
SEVENTH IN THE NATION AND THE

00:35:44.209 --> 00:35:46.745 region:rollup2
SHARE OF RECENT HIGH SCHOOL

00:35:45.343 --> 00:35:48.079 region:rollup2
GRADUATES TO GO TO A FOUR YEAR

00:35:46.745 --> 00:35:49.481 region:rollup2
COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY THAT'S THE

00:35:48.079 --> 00:35:50.582 region:rollup2
TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY TWO NUMBER.

00:35:49.481 --> 00:35:52.117 region:rollup2
SO WERE DOWN NEAR THE BOTTOM

00:35:50.582 --> 00:35:53.485 region:rollup2
AMONG ALL STATES THERE'S A LOT

00:35:52.117 --> 00:35:55.553 region:rollup2
OF ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT THERE.

00:35:53.485 --> 00:35:56.621 region:rollup2
WE RANK FIFTH HIGHEST AMONG ALL

00:35:55.553 --> 00:35:57.922 region:rollup2
STATES IN THE SHARE THAT GO TO

00:35:56.621 --> 00:35:59.591 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY COLLEGE THAT COMMUNITY

00:35:57.922 --> 00:36:01.292 region:rollup2
COLLEGE FOCUS.

00:35:59.591 --> 00:36:03.495 region:rollup2
OUR IN OUR STATE WHICH IS PARTLY

00:36:01.292 --> 00:36:05.363 region:rollup2
A RESULT OF OF THE MASTER PLAN

00:36:03.495 --> 00:36:06.798 region:rollup2
AND AND OTHER ON DECISIONS WE'VE

00:36:05.363 --> 00:36:08.400 region:rollup2
MADE AND DECISIONS MADE BY

00:36:06.798 --> 00:36:10.402 region:rollup2
STUDENTS AND FAMILIES.

00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:12.370 region:rollup2
GIVES US A TREMENDOUS POOL OF

00:36:10.402 --> 00:36:13.605 region:rollup2
STUDENTS TO WORK WITH.

00:36:12.370 --> 00:36:15.040 region:rollup2
I'D LIKE YOU DID ESPECIALLY PAY

00:36:13.605 --> 00:36:16.508 region:rollup2
ATTENTION TO THAT THAT TRANSFER

00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:18.410 region:rollup2
BOX THERE IT'S A HUNDRED AND

00:36:16.508 --> 00:36:19.644 region:rollup2
FORTY FIVE OUT OF THAT INITIAL

00:36:18.410 --> 00:36:20.945 region:rollup2
COHORT OF ONE THOUSAND NINTH

00:36:19.644 --> 00:36:22.347 region:rollup2
GRADERS A HUNDRED FORTY FIVE OUT

00:36:20.945 --> 00:36:24.049 region:rollup2
OF THE THREE HUNDRED SIXTY TWO

00:36:22.347 --> 00:36:25.083 region:rollup2
TO TEN COMMUNITY COLLEGES.

00:36:24.049 --> 00:36:26.184 region:rollup2
YOU CAN TELL I'M A DEMOGRAPHER

00:36:25.083 --> 00:36:28.019 region:rollup2
LIKE THROWING OUT NUMBERS EARLY

00:36:26.184 --> 00:36:29.988 region:rollup2
IN THE MORNING.

00:36:28.019 --> 00:36:31.056 region:rollup2
BUT IN ANY EVENT THAT NUMBERS

00:36:29.988 --> 00:36:32.157 region:rollup2
TO LAW ARE THE COMMUNITY

00:36:31.056 --> 00:36:33.625 region:rollup2
COLLEGES NO IT'S TOO LOW THEY

00:36:32.157 --> 00:36:34.726 region:rollup2
HAVE A VERY AGGRESSIVE A VISION

00:36:33.625 --> 00:36:35.894 region:rollup2
FOR SUCCESS WHICH WOULD

00:36:34.726 --> 00:36:37.362 region:rollup2
DRAMATICALLY INCREASE THAT

00:36:35.894 --> 00:36:38.830 region:rollup2
NUMBER AT THE GOALS TO INCREASE

00:36:37.362 --> 00:36:40.498 region:rollup2
THAT NUMBER THIRTY FIVE PERCENT

00:36:38.830 --> 00:36:42.033 region:rollup2
THE NEXT FIVE YEARS.

00:36:40.498 --> 00:36:43.668 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF NUMBER TRANSFER

00:36:42.033 --> 00:36:46.237 region:rollup2
STUDENTS TO GO TO UC AND CSU. IF

00:36:43.668 --> 00:36:47.706 region:rollup2
THEY DO THAT THAT WOULD PUT US

00:36:46.237 --> 00:36:49.607 region:rollup2
AS A STATE AND THEM ON A SYSTEM

00:36:47.706 --> 00:36:51.376 region:rollup2
YOU COMPLETELY. ARE ON PAR WITH

00:36:49.607 --> 00:36:53.812 region:rollup2
WHAT WE HAVE RECOMMENDED IN

00:36:51.376 --> 00:36:56.047 region:rollup2
TERMS OF CLOSING THE DEGREE GAP

00:36:53.812 --> 00:36:57.682 region:rollup2
AND THEN FINALLY WE HAVE THIS

00:36:56.047 --> 00:36:59.384 region:rollup2
TRANSITION THAN FROM.

00:36:57.682 --> 00:37:01.820 region:rollup2
THOSE WHO MAKE IT TO A FOUR

00:36:59.384 --> 00:37:03.888 region:rollup2
YEAR COLLEGE TO EARNING A

00:37:01.820 --> 00:37:06.725 region:rollup2
BACHELOR'S DEGREE AND THERE

00:37:03.888 --> 00:37:08.426 region:rollup2
AGAIN WE HAVE. CONTINUED TO DROP

00:37:06.725 --> 00:37:10.328 region:rollup2
OFF SO THERE'S A LOT OF PARTS

00:37:08.426 --> 00:37:11.863 region:rollup2
THIS PIPELINE WHERE THE

00:37:10.328 --> 00:37:13.398 region:rollup2
INSTITUTIONS ARE WORKING TO

00:37:11.863 --> 00:37:15.700 region:rollup2
IMPROVE STUDENT OUTCOMES. AND

00:37:13.398 --> 00:37:18.036 region:rollup2
WHERE WE CAN ACTUALLY INCREASE

00:37:15.700 --> 00:37:19.137 region:rollup2
THE NUMBER OF BACHELOR'S DEGREES

00:37:18.036 --> 00:37:20.772 region:rollup2
WE PRODUCE.

00:37:19.137 --> 00:37:21.940 region:rollup2
IF YOU MOVE THEN TO SLIDE FOR WE

00:37:20.772 --> 00:37:23.074 region:rollup2
HAVE ACTUALLY IDENTIFIED A VERY

00:37:21.940 --> 00:37:25.243 region:rollup2
AMBITIOUS GOALS FOR EACH OF THE

00:37:23.074 --> 00:37:26.211 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS. ARE YOU SEE CSU PLAYS

00:37:25.243 --> 00:37:26.845 region:rollup2
ARE THE LARGEST ROLE AND THAT'S

00:37:26.211 --> 00:37:28.446 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT IS BY FAR AND AWAY

00:37:26.845 --> 00:37:29.781 region:rollup2
THE LARGEST. UNIVERSITY SYSTEM

00:37:28.446 --> 00:37:31.749 region:rollup2
IN THE STATE AND IN FACT THE

00:37:29.781 --> 00:37:32.550 region:rollup2
LARGEST UNIVERSITY SYSTEM IN THE

00:37:31.749 --> 00:37:33.151 region:rollup2
COUNTRY.

00:37:32.550 --> 00:37:34.552 region:rollup2
WITH.

00:37:33.151 --> 00:37:37.088 region:rollup2
THE DISH NO DEGREES NECESSARY

00:37:34.552 --> 00:37:39.190 region:rollup2
FOR THEM ANNOUNCING TOALMOST A

00:37:37.088 --> 00:37:41.226 region:rollup2
HALF MILLION AND. JUST UNDER

00:37:39.190 --> 00:37:43.128 region:rollup2
HALF THE TOTAL BUT OF COURSE YOU

00:37:41.226 --> 00:37:44.662 region:rollup2
SEE AND A PRIVATE NON PROFITS

00:37:43.128 --> 00:37:46.164 region:rollup2
PLAY A VERY IMPORTANT ROLE AS

00:37:44.662 --> 00:37:48.833 region:rollup2
WELL.

00:37:46.164 --> 00:37:51.102 region:rollup2
IF WE MOVE THEN TO SLIDE FIVE

00:37:48.833 --> 00:37:52.437 region:rollup2
PP I SEE HAS IDENTIFIED SPECIFIC

00:37:51.102 --> 00:37:54.205 region:rollup2
TARGETS THAT WOULD NEED TO BE IN

00:37:52.437 --> 00:37:55.673 region:rollup2
THAT TO CLOSE THE DEGREE GAP.

00:37:54.205 --> 00:37:56.841 region:rollup2
THESE ARE TARGETS IN TERMS OF

00:37:55.673 --> 00:37:57.642 region:rollup2
THE STE ELIGIBILITY SHARES THAT

00:37:56.841 --> 00:38:00.011 region:rollup2
THE SHERIFF HIGH SCHOOL

00:37:57.642 --> 00:38:01.513 region:rollup2
GRADUATES THAT ARE ELIGIBLE FOR

00:38:00.011 --> 00:38:03.515 region:rollup2
YOU SEE OR CSU.

00:38:01.513 --> 00:38:04.082 region:rollup2
AND YOU'LL SEE THAT OUR GOALS

00:38:03.515 --> 00:38:05.383 region:rollup2
THAT ARE FOR YOU YOU SEE THE

00:38:04.082 --> 00:38:06.484 region:rollup2
MOVE FROM TWELVE AND A HALF

00:38:05.383 --> 00:38:08.453 region:rollup2
PERCENT TO SEVENTEEN AND A HALF

00:38:06.484 --> 00:38:09.687 region:rollup2
PERCENT. FOR CSU TO MOVE FROM

00:38:08.453 --> 00:38:10.688 region:rollup2
THE TOP ONE THIRD OF HIGH SCHOOL

00:38:09.687 --> 00:38:12.190 region:rollup2
GRADUATES TO THE TOP FORTY

00:38:10.688 --> 00:38:13.291 region:rollup2
PERCENT OF HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES

00:38:12.190 --> 00:38:14.759 region:rollup2
WE HAVE FACED IN PERIODS FOR

00:38:13.291 --> 00:38:16.794 region:rollup2
EACH ONE OF THESE TARGETS WHICH

00:38:14.759 --> 00:38:17.595 region:rollup2
IS ON THE FAR RIGHT THERE. ARE

00:38:16.794 --> 00:38:20.031 region:rollup2
THE.

00:38:17.595 --> 00:38:21.533 region:rollup2
AGAIN SOME GOOD NEWS IS THAT

00:38:20.031 --> 00:38:23.268 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES

00:38:21.533 --> 00:38:24.636 region:rollup2
ARE INCREASINGLY MEETING THE A

00:38:23.268 --> 00:38:26.070 region:rollup2
THROUGH G. CRITERIA THE COLLEGE

00:38:24.636 --> 00:38:28.139 region:rollup2
PREPARATORY COURSES REQUIRED FOR

00:38:26.070 --> 00:38:29.841 region:rollup2
ENTRANCE TO UC AND CSU. WE SEEN

00:38:28.139 --> 00:38:32.777 region:rollup2
STRONG GAINS AMONG EVERY GROUP

00:38:29.841 --> 00:38:33.912 region:rollup2
IN CALIFORNIA INCLUDING LATINOS

00:38:32.777 --> 00:38:35.146 region:rollup2
AND AFRICAN AMERICANS.

00:38:33.912 --> 00:38:36.181 region:rollup2
AND IN FACT THE ELIGIBILITY

00:38:35.146 --> 00:38:39.384 region:rollup2
STUDY THAT WAS.

00:38:36.181 --> 00:38:41.386 region:rollup2
PRODUCED LAST YEAR SHOWED THAT

00:38:39.384 --> 00:38:43.521 region:rollup2
SEE ISSUES ACTUALLY ADMIT. THAT

00:38:41.386 --> 00:38:44.722 region:rollup2
THAT THAT FORTY PERCENT OF HIGH

00:38:43.521 --> 00:38:45.857 region:rollup2
SCHOOL GRADUATES A LITTLE OVER

00:38:44.722 --> 00:38:47.458 region:rollup2
FORTY PERCENT HIGH SCHOOL

00:38:45.857 --> 00:38:49.694 region:rollup2
GRADUATES ARE ACTUALLY MEETING.

00:38:47.458 --> 00:38:51.496 region:rollup2
THE ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA OF CSU

00:38:49.694 --> 00:38:53.331 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW SO IN A WAY WE'VE

00:38:51.496 --> 00:38:54.933 region:rollup2
ALREADY MET THIS TARGET. YEARS

00:38:53.331 --> 00:38:57.368 region:rollup2
AHEAD OF SCHEDULE BECAUSE

00:38:54.933 --> 00:38:59.304 region:rollup2
STUDENTS ARE DOING SUCH A GOOD

00:38:57.368 --> 00:39:01.306 region:rollup2
JOB IN TERMS OF. COMPLETING

00:38:59.304 --> 00:39:03.474 region:rollup2
THOSE COURSES REQUIRED FOR CSU

00:39:01.306 --> 00:39:04.742 region:rollup2
ELIGIBILITY AT THE GRADES

00:39:03.474 --> 00:39:07.111 region:rollup2
REQUIRED BY CSU.

00:39:04.742 --> 00:39:08.012 region:rollup2
I YOU SEE ARE ALSO IS ACTUALLY A

00:39:07.111 --> 00:39:09.113 region:rollup2
SLIGHTLY HIGHER THAN THEIR

00:39:08.012 --> 00:39:10.448 region:rollup2
TWELVE AND A HALF PERCENT

00:39:09.113 --> 00:39:12.350 region:rollup2
ACCORDING TO THAT SAME

00:39:10.448 --> 00:39:13.384 region:rollup2
ELIGIBILITY STUDY.

00:39:12.350 --> 00:39:14.953 region:rollup2
THAT WE ALSO THEN.

00:39:13.384 --> 00:39:16.754 region:rollup2
FOCUS ON TRANSFER AND AS THEY

00:39:14.953 --> 00:39:17.755 region:rollup2
SAID THIS IS INCREDIBLE AYE

00:39:16.754 --> 00:39:19.924 region:rollup2
CREDIBLY IMPORTANT.

00:39:17.755 --> 00:39:23.061 region:rollup2
MECHANISM FOR IMPROVING COLLEGE

00:39:19.924 --> 00:39:25.363 region:rollup2
GRADUATION AND. AND YOU SEE.

00:39:23.061 --> 00:39:25.863 region:rollup2
THEIR THESE NUMBERS REPRESENT

00:39:25.363 --> 00:39:26.965 region:rollup2
THAT THIRTY FIVE PERCENT

00:39:25.863 --> 00:39:28.533 region:rollup2
INCREASE

00:39:26.965 --> 00:39:31.669 region:rollup2
THAT IS OF THE VISION FOR

00:39:28.533 --> 00:39:33.104 region:rollup2
SUCCESS. A GOAL THAT OUR

00:39:31.669 --> 00:39:34.973 region:rollup2
CHANCELLOR OAKLEY AND HIS TEAM

00:39:33.104 --> 00:39:36.708 region:rollup2
HAVE IDENTIFIED. AND THEN

00:39:34.973 --> 00:39:37.742 region:rollup2
FINALLY ON IMPROVING GRADUATION

00:39:36.708 --> 00:39:39.310 region:rollup2
RATES OF STUDENTS WHO ARE

00:39:37.742 --> 00:39:40.845 region:rollup2
ALREADY IN OUR FOUR YEAR

00:39:39.310 --> 00:39:42.213 region:rollup2
COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES IS

00:39:40.845 --> 00:39:45.416 region:rollup2
ESSENTIAL ANNUAL SEE.

00:39:42.213 --> 00:39:46.317 region:rollup2
THERE WE SEE UC AND CSU ARE

00:39:45.416 --> 00:39:48.386 region:rollup2
EIGHTY THREE AND FIFTY SEVEN

00:39:46.317 --> 00:39:49.654 region:rollup2
PERCENT OF RESPECTIVELY WHEN WE

00:39:48.386 --> 00:39:50.989 region:rollup2
DEVELOP THESE PROJECTIONS.

00:39:49.654 --> 00:39:52.624 region:rollup2
THEIR LITTLE HIGHER NOW.

00:39:50.989 --> 00:39:54.993 region:rollup2
AND THEN WE HAD OUR CLOSING THE

00:39:52.624 --> 00:39:56.194 region:rollup2
GAP TARGETS FOR YOU SEE NINETY

00:39:54.993 --> 00:39:58.396 region:rollup2
TWO PERCENT AND SEE IF YOU FOR

00:39:56.194 --> 00:40:00.098 region:rollup2
SEVENTY FOUR PERCENT. ARE CSU

00:39:58.396 --> 00:40:03.468 region:rollup2
TARGET IS IN FACT.

00:40:00.098 --> 00:40:06.404 region:rollup2
EGGS A LITTLE LESS AMBITIOUS

00:40:03.468 --> 00:40:09.941 region:rollup2
THAN BUT CSU HAS SAT OUR TARGETS

00:40:06.404 --> 00:40:11.809 region:rollup2
OVER TWO THOUSAND THIRTY A CSU

00:40:09.941 --> 00:40:14.279 region:rollup2
HOUSE A SEVENTY PERCENT

00:40:11.809 --> 00:40:16.414 region:rollup2
GRADUATION RATE GOAL FOR THEIR

00:40:14.279 --> 00:40:19.550 region:rollup2
SIX YEAR GRADUATION RATE. BY

00:40:16.414 --> 00:40:21.953 region:rollup2
TWENTY TWENTY FIVE SO THAT'S

00:40:19.550 --> 00:40:23.988 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY IF YOU IF YOU DRAW THE

00:40:21.953 --> 00:40:25.456 region:rollup2
LINES THAT'S ACTUALLY A LITTLE

00:40:23.988 --> 00:40:27.492 region:rollup2
BIT MORE AMBITIOUS THAN WHAT

00:40:25.456 --> 00:40:29.827 region:rollup2
WE'VE DONE SO WE'VE GOT SOME

00:40:27.492 --> 00:40:31.896 region:rollup2
GOOD VISION WE'VE GOT SOME GOOD

00:40:29.827 --> 00:40:34.132 region:rollup2
PLANS ARE ON THE PART OF THE

00:40:31.896 --> 00:40:37.135 region:rollup2
SEGMENTS. IN TERMS OF TRYING TO

00:40:34.132 --> 00:40:38.569 region:rollup2
IMPROVE GRADUATION RATES AND

00:40:37.135 --> 00:40:42.206 region:rollup2
COMPLETION I KNOW WE'RE GONNA

00:40:38.569 --> 00:40:43.541 region:rollup2
HEAR FROM PRIVATE NON PROFITS

00:40:42.206 --> 00:40:45.877 region:rollup2
LATER AND I THINK THEY'LL TALK

00:40:43.541 --> 00:40:47.645 region:rollup2
ABOUT. A SOME OF THEIR GOALS

00:40:45.877 --> 00:40:49.314 region:rollup2
WITH RESPECT TO ENROLLMENT

00:40:47.645 --> 00:40:53.551 region:rollup2
INCREASES IN SERVING OUR

00:40:49.314 --> 00:40:54.819 region:rollup2
STUDENTS SO THERE'S A LOT OF

00:40:53.551 --> 00:40:55.787 region:rollup2
GOOD NEWS. OUT THERE.

00:40:54.819 --> 00:40:57.221 region:rollup2
A I'M GONNA GO AHEAD AND.

00:40:55.787 --> 00:40:58.222 region:rollup2
JUST.

00:40:57.221 --> 00:40:59.724 region:rollup2
VERY BRIEFLY MENTIONED THIS NEXT

00:40:58.222 --> 00:41:00.391 region:rollup2
SLIDE SLIDE SIX WE BREAK OUT

00:40:59.724 --> 00:41:05.763 region:rollup2
THESE THESE.

00:41:00.391 --> 00:41:08.066 region:rollup2
TARGETS BECAUSE WE ASSUME MORE.

00:41:05.763 --> 00:41:08.599 region:rollup2
AND IMPROVING GRADUATION RATES

00:41:08.066 --> 00:41:11.169 region:rollup2
THAN THEY DO AND CSU THEIR

00:41:08.599 --> 00:41:13.671 region:rollup2
THEIR.

00:41:11.169 --> 00:41:14.572 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY A LITTLE HIGHER

00:41:13.671 --> 00:41:16.074 region:rollup2
ENROLLMENT NUMBERS ARE A LITTLE

00:41:14.572 --> 00:41:17.475 region:rollup2
HIGHER BECAUSE. I DON'T THEY

00:41:16.074 --> 00:41:20.311 region:rollup2
HAVE A SLIGHTLY MORE AMBITIOUS

00:41:17.475 --> 00:41:21.979 region:rollup2
GOALS WITH RESPECT GRADUATION

00:41:20.311 --> 00:41:24.415 region:rollup2
RATES THAN OUR OUR TARGETS HAD

00:41:21.979 --> 00:41:25.249 region:rollup2
SUGGESTED.

00:41:24.415 --> 00:41:26.784 region:rollup2
THEN IF WE TURN TO SLIDE SEVEN

00:41:25.249 --> 00:41:27.852 region:rollup2
OF THIS MIGHT NOT SEEM LIKE A

00:41:26.784 --> 00:41:28.453 region:rollup2
VERY IMPRESSIVE SLIGHT BUT THIS

00:41:27.852 --> 00:41:28.686 region:rollup2
IS THE ONE THAT MAKES ME MOST

00:41:28.453 --> 00:41:29.921 region:rollup2
HAPPY.

00:41:28.686 --> 00:41:31.923 region:rollup2
.

00:41:29.921 --> 00:41:33.658 region:rollup2
WHAT WE HAVE HERE ARE THOSE

00:41:31.923 --> 00:41:35.560 region:rollup2
INITIAL LINES YOU SAW BEFORE BUT

00:41:33.658 --> 00:41:37.362 region:rollup2
THIS TIME BROKEN DOWN FOR THE TO

00:41:35.560 --> 00:41:38.763 region:rollup2
PLOT LARGE PUBLIC SO THAT THE

00:41:37.362 --> 00:41:40.098 region:rollup2
SECTORS YOU SEE ON THE LEFT IN

00:41:38.763 --> 00:41:41.733 region:rollup2
CSU ON THE RIGHT?

00:41:40.098 --> 00:41:42.700 region:rollup2
AND THAT NEW GRAY BAR WHICH I'VE

00:41:41.733 --> 00:41:43.601 region:rollup2
ADDED IS WHAT'S ACTUALLY

00:41:42.700 --> 00:41:44.635 region:rollup2
HAPPENED SINCE WE DEVELOPED OUR

00:41:43.601 --> 00:41:46.604 region:rollup2
PROJECTION SEVERAL YEARS AGO AND

00:41:44.635 --> 00:41:49.307 region:rollup2
THE GOOD NEWS IS BOTH YOU SEE

00:41:46.604 --> 00:41:50.975 region:rollup2
AND CSU ARE AHEAD OF. THE

00:41:49.307 --> 00:41:52.710 region:rollup2
TARGETS THAT WE HAVE SAT AND

00:41:50.975 --> 00:41:54.479 region:rollup2
THIS IS BECAUSE OF VERY SPECIFIC

00:41:52.710 --> 00:41:56.047 region:rollup2
ACTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN TAKEN BY

00:41:54.479 --> 00:41:57.648 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR

00:41:56.047 --> 00:41:59.283 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF PROVIDING ADDITIONAL

00:41:57.648 --> 00:42:01.919 region:rollup2
FUNDING. FOR ENROLLMENT AND FOR

00:41:59.283 --> 00:42:03.454 region:rollup2
STUDENT SUCCESS AND BY ACTIONS

00:42:01.919 --> 00:42:05.323 region:rollup2
TAKEN BY THE INSTITUTIONS

00:42:03.454 --> 00:42:08.860 region:rollup2
THEMSELVES TO ENROLL STUDENTS.

00:42:05.323 --> 00:42:10.461 region:rollup2
AND INCREASE OUR COMPLETION AT

00:42:08.860 --> 00:42:11.562 region:rollup2
PERSISTENCE COMPLETION AND

00:42:10.461 --> 00:42:11.729 region:rollup2
EVENTUALLY GRADUATION RATES

00:42:11.562 --> 00:42:13.498 region:rollup2
SO.

00:42:11.729 --> 00:42:16.034 region:rollup2
CAN.

00:42:13.498 --> 00:42:17.468 region:rollup2
THE GOOD NEWS IS WE'RE ON PACE.

00:42:16.034 --> 00:42:18.469 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY WHEN YOU LOOK ABOUT

00:42:17.468 --> 00:42:19.871 region:rollup2
CHART YOU SEE WE'RE JUST AT THE

00:42:18.469 --> 00:42:21.439 region:rollup2
BEGINNING AND WE HAVE A LOT MORE

00:42:19.871 --> 00:42:24.108 region:rollup2
WORK. TO GO.

00:42:21.439 --> 00:42:24.776 region:rollup2
ALRIGHT AND THEN UP FINALLY. I'D

00:42:24.108 --> 00:42:26.978 region:rollup2
LIKE TO KNOW THAT.

00:42:24.776 --> 00:42:30.681 region:rollup2
AND VERY IMPORTANTLY THAT ONE

00:42:26.978 --> 00:42:32.984 region:rollup2
OF THE BENEFITS OF CLOSING THE

00:42:30.681 --> 00:42:34.619 region:rollup2
THE DEGREE GAP IS A TREMENDOUS

00:42:32.984 --> 00:42:37.622 region:rollup2
IMPROVEMENT IN EQUITY.

00:42:34.619 --> 00:42:39.957 region:rollup2
OUTCOMES IN CALIFORNIA OUR HIGH

00:42:37.622 --> 00:42:41.559 region:rollup2
SCHOOLS ARE COMPRISED OF. EXCUSE

00:42:39.957 --> 00:42:42.293 region:rollup2
ME ACT AND.

00:42:41.559 --> 00:42:43.761 region:rollup2
ARE.

00:42:42.293 --> 00:42:45.496 region:rollup2
COMPRISED OF A MAJORITY OF

00:42:43.761 --> 00:42:47.265 region:rollup2
STUDENTS WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR

00:42:45.496 --> 00:42:49.267 region:rollup2
FREE OR REDUCED PRICE LUNCH.

00:42:47.265 --> 00:42:49.801 region:rollup2
LATINOS ARE A MAJORITY OF

00:42:49.267 --> 00:42:51.035 region:rollup2
STUDENTS AN ARCADE TWELVE

00:42:49.801 --> 00:42:53.037 region:rollup2
SYSTEM.

00:42:51.035 --> 00:42:55.139 region:rollup2
SO FOR CALIFORNIA TO REACH THESE

00:42:53.037 --> 00:42:57.575 region:rollup2
GOALS MEANS THAT WE ARE GOING TO

00:42:55.139 --> 00:42:58.676 region:rollup2
BE INCLUDING STUDENTS FROM

00:42:57.575 --> 00:43:00.344 region:rollup2
GROUPS THAT HAVE HISTORICALLY

00:42:58.676 --> 00:43:01.879 region:rollup2
BEEN UNDERREPRESENTED IN HIGH

00:43:00.344 --> 00:43:03.247 region:rollup2
SCHOOL AND COLLEGE. ARE IN

00:43:01.879 --> 00:43:04.615 region:rollup2
NUMBERS THAT WE'VE NEVER SEEN

00:43:03.247 --> 00:43:06.451 region:rollup2
BEFORE AND.

00:43:04.615 --> 00:43:08.986 region:rollup2
FOR STUDENTS FROM LOW INCOME

00:43:06.451 --> 00:43:10.288 region:rollup2
FAMILIES ENSURING I THINK MOST

00:43:08.986 --> 00:43:12.590 region:rollup2
IMPORTANTLY THAT HIGHER

00:43:10.288 --> 00:43:14.559 region:rollup2
EDUCATION CONTINUES TO SERVE AS

00:43:12.590 --> 00:43:16.360 region:rollup2
A LADDER OF ECONOMIC.

00:43:14.559 --> 00:43:18.529 region:rollup2
AND SOCIAL MOBILITY AND DOES

00:43:16.360 --> 00:43:20.665 region:rollup2
NOT SIMPLY.

00:43:18.529 --> 00:43:22.200 region:rollup2
REINFORCE CLASS IN ECONOMIC

00:43:20.665 --> 00:43:23.167 region:rollup2
DIVIDES THAT EXIST IN OUR

00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:24.435 region:rollup2
COUNTRY AND WE HAVE A LOT OF

00:43:23.167 --> 00:43:26.204 region:rollup2
GOOD.

00:43:24.435 --> 00:43:28.306 region:rollup2
STORIES TO TELL A GOOD TRACK

00:43:26.204 --> 00:43:29.640 region:rollup2
RECORD IN CALIFORNIA THAT ARE

00:43:28.306 --> 00:43:30.775 region:rollup2
HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEMS HAVE

00:43:29.640 --> 00:43:32.310 region:rollup2
BEEN MORE INCLUSIVE.

00:43:30.775 --> 00:43:34.712 region:rollup2
THAN THOSE IN OTHER STATES

00:43:32.310 --> 00:43:37.348 region:rollup2
INCLUDING OUR PUBLIC SYSTEMS AND

00:43:34.712 --> 00:43:39.784 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA. AND TO RISE TO THE

00:43:37.348 --> 00:43:42.186 region:rollup2
CHALLENGE OF THE FUTURE WE NEED

00:43:39.784 --> 00:43:44.355 region:rollup2
TO ENSURE THAT THAT CONTINUES

00:43:42.186 --> 00:43:45.556 region:rollup2
TANKER. MEETING THESE GOALS WILL

00:43:44.355 --> 00:43:47.492 region:rollup2
BE AYE COOPER INCREDIBLY

00:43:45.556 --> 00:43:48.893 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT STEP IN MAKING SURE

00:43:47.492 --> 00:43:50.761 region:rollup2
THAT HIGHER EDUCATION CONTINUES

00:43:48.893 --> 00:43:51.996 region:rollup2
TO DO THAT FINALLY I SHOULD NOTE

00:43:50.761 --> 00:43:54.632 region:rollup2
THAT OUR PROJECTIONS ARE FOCUSED

00:43:51.996 --> 00:43:55.833 region:rollup2
ON BACCALAUREATE. UP PRODUCTION

00:43:54.632 --> 00:43:57.768 region:rollup2
BUT.

00:43:55.833 --> 00:44:00.972 region:rollup2
OTHERS HAVE LOOKED AT OUR

00:43:57.768 --> 00:44:04.709 region:rollup2
CREDENTIALS IN POST SECONDARY

00:44:00.972 --> 00:44:07.245 region:rollup2
BELOW BACKSPACE AGREES AS WELL

00:44:04.709 --> 00:44:09.914 region:rollup2
AS WORK YOU'VE DONE ON BASHES

00:44:07.245 --> 00:44:12.583 region:rollup2
GRACE THIS IS MONDAY DOESN'T IT

00:44:09.914 --> 00:44:14.952 region:rollup2
GOING TO HEAR FROM AND AMEND IT.

00:44:12.583 --> 00:44:16.787 region:rollup2
AND I SHOULD ALSO NOTE ARE THAT

00:44:14.952 --> 00:44:18.723 region:rollup2
YOU SEE HAS RIGHTLY POINTED OUT

00:44:16.787 --> 00:44:20.224 region:rollup2
THE IMPORTANCE OF GRADUATE

00:44:18.723 --> 00:44:22.326 region:rollup2
STUDENTS IN THE ROLE OF THE

00:44:20.224 --> 00:44:25.129 region:rollup2
GRADUATE STUDENTS PLAY IN OUR

00:44:22.326 --> 00:44:27.899 region:rollup2
ECONOMY THEY ACTUALLY HAVE THE

00:44:25.129 --> 00:44:29.901 region:rollup2
PAST. LABOR MARKET OUTCOMES OF

BUT ALSO.

00:44:31.602 --> 00:44:37.975 region:rollup2
ARE INVOLVED IN TRADING FIRMS

00:44:35.540 --> 00:44:40.511 region:rollup2

EDUCATE UNDERGRADUATES THAT YOU

00:44:40.511 --> 00:44:47.118 region:rollup2
SEE AS THE UC. OUR UNDERGRADUATE

00:44:44.649 --> 00:44:50.955 region:rollup2

00:44:47.118 --> 00:44:51.489 region:rollup2
AND IT'S A GRADUATE STUDENT YOU

00:44:50.955 --> 00:44:55.960 region:rollup2

COMMUNITY AND A VERY ENGAGED

00:45:08.272 --> 00:45:11.142 region:rollup2
CITIZENRY.

00:45:10.107 --> 00:45:12.043 region:rollup2
HOW MUCH ARE WORK FOR THE PAST

00:45:11.142 --> 00:45:13.811 region:rollup2
SEVEN YEARS HAS BEEN FOCUSED ON

00:45:12.043 --> 00:45:15.079 region:rollup2
MAKING THE ECONOMIC AND EQUITY

00:45:13.811 --> 00:45:15.880 region:rollup2
DRIVEN CASE FOR INCREASING

00:45:15.079 --> 00:45:17.648 region:rollup2
DEGREE ATTAINMENT HERE IN

00:45:15.880 --> 00:45:19.083 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA? IN VERY MUCH BAKED

00:45:17.648 --> 00:45:20.851 region:rollup2
INTO OUR VIEW OF HIGHER

00:45:19.083 --> 00:45:22.520 region:rollup2
EDUCATION IS THE ASSUMPTION THAT

00:45:20.851 --> 00:45:23.888 region:rollup2
THE ECONOMIC MEETING THE

00:45:22.520 --> 00:45:25.923 region:rollup2
ECONOMIC NEEDS OF THE STATE.

00:45:23.888 --> 00:45:27.291 region:rollup2
WILL BRING ABOUT THE DESIRED AT

00:45:25.923 --> 00:45:28.593 region:rollup2
NOT OUT COME OF HAVING MORE

00:45:27.291 --> 00:45:30.027 region:rollup2
EQUITABLE OUTCOMES FOR THE

00:45:28.593 --> 00:45:30.194 region:rollup2
STATE'S RESIDENTS.

00:45:30.027 --> 00:45:32.663 region:rollup2
SO.

00:45:30.194 --> 00:45:33.898 region:rollup2
WHAT I HAVE BEFORE YOU IS A

00:45:32.663 --> 00:45:35.600 region:rollup2
POWER POINT ACCOMPANIED BY CAN A

00:45:33.898 --> 00:45:37.134 region:rollup2
FORMAL REMARKS?

00:45:35.600 --> 00:45:39.270 region:rollup2
MORE OR LESS EVERY PARAGRAPH

00:45:37.134 --> 00:45:40.071 region:rollup2
EXPLAINS EVERY SLIDE BUT I DON'T

00:45:39.270 --> 00:45:41.038 region:rollup2
WANNA GO THROUGH THAT WHAT I'D

00:45:40.071 --> 00:45:42.506 region:rollup2
LIKE TO DO WITH KIND OF TALK

00:45:41.038 --> 00:45:44.875 region:rollup2
WITH YOU CONCEPTUALLY ABOUT THE

00:45:42.506 --> 00:45:46.244 region:rollup2
FOR BIG IDEAS. THAT WE THINK

00:45:44.875 --> 00:45:47.345 region:rollup2
WILL COMPLEMENT THE WORK THAT

00:45:46.244 --> 00:45:48.045 region:rollup2
OUR COLLEAGUES PP I SEE HAVE

00:45:47.345 --> 00:45:49.947 region:rollup2
DONE IN TERMS OF THINKING

00:45:48.045 --> 00:45:52.984 region:rollup2
THROUGH THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN

00:45:49.947 --> 00:45:54.752 region:rollup2
ELIGIBILITY POOLS AND ROMANCE

00:45:52.984 --> 00:45:56.153 region:rollup2
TRANSFER AND COMPLETION. BECAUSE

00:45:54.752 --> 00:45:57.255 region:rollup2
I THINK BY ITSELF THAT SERVES A

00:45:56.153 --> 00:45:58.422 region:rollup2
VERY ROBUST MODEL FOR HOW THE

00:45:57.255 --> 00:45:59.790 region:rollup2
STATE MIGHT APPROACH THINKING

00:45:58.422 --> 00:46:01.158 region:rollup2
ABOUT SUPPORTING INCREASED

00:45:59.790 --> 00:46:01.826 region:rollup2
DEGREE ATTAINMENT. BUT WE THINK

00:46:01.158 --> 00:46:02.827 region:rollup2
THAT THERE ARE A COUPLE OF OTHER

00:46:01.826 --> 00:46:05.029 region:rollup2
SUBTLETIES THAT OUGHT TO BE

00:46:02.827 --> 00:46:05.596 region:rollup2
INCORPORATED INTO ANY MODEL IF

00:46:05.029 --> 00:46:07.598 region:rollup2
YOU WELL AS WELL.

00:46:05.596 --> 00:46:08.299 region:rollup2
.

00:46:07.598 --> 00:46:09.900 region:rollup2
BY WAY OF BACKGROUND AS YOU KNOW

00:46:08.299 --> 00:46:11.802 region:rollup2
WE WERE ESTABLISHING AROUND

00:46:09.900 --> 00:46:13.271 region:rollup2
TWENTY TEN TO IN RESPONSE TO A

00:46:11.802 --> 00:46:15.072 region:rollup2
NATIONAL EFFORT TO INCREASE

00:46:13.271 --> 00:46:16.140 region:rollup2
DEGREE ATTAINMENT. AND I WE'VE

00:46:15.072 --> 00:46:17.708 region:rollup2
ALWAYS OPERATED FROM THE

00:46:16.140 --> 00:46:19.243 region:rollup2
ASSUMPTION THAT IF CALIFORNIA

00:46:17.708 --> 00:46:20.478 region:rollup2
WERE TO REACH FIFTY FIVE PERCENT

00:46:19.243 --> 00:46:22.680 region:rollup2
DEGREE ATTAINMENT BY TWENTY

00:46:20.478 --> 00:46:24.382 region:rollup2
TWENTY FIVE. IT ACTUALLY PLACE

00:46:22.680 --> 00:46:25.216 region:rollup2
THE STATE IN THE TOP TEN OF

00:46:24.382 --> 00:46:26.584 region:rollup2
STATES.

00:46:25.216 --> 00:46:27.918 region:rollup2
WITH EDUCATIONAL DEGREE

00:46:26.584 --> 00:46:28.919 region:rollup2
ATTAINMENT.

00:46:27.918 --> 00:46:30.554 region:rollup2
UP UNFORTUNATELY WERE NOT ON

00:46:28.919 --> 00:46:32.056 region:rollup2
TRACK TO.

00:46:30.554 --> 00:46:33.591 region:rollup2
GET TO THIS GOAL OUR ORIGINAL

00:46:32.056 --> 00:46:34.458 region:rollup2
RESEARCH IN TWENTY TWELVE FOUND

00:46:33.591 --> 00:46:35.459 region:rollup2
THAT WE WERE GONNA BE SHORT BY

00:46:34.458 --> 00:46:37.461 region:rollup2
POINT ABOUT TWO POINT THREE

00:46:35.459 --> 00:46:38.763 region:rollup2
MILLION DEGREES. AND OVER THE

00:46:37.461 --> 00:46:40.131 region:rollup2
LAST FIVE YEARS WE'VE UPDATED

00:46:38.763 --> 00:46:42.667 region:rollup2
THAT NUMBER TWICE.

00:46:40.131 --> 00:46:44.468 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S BASED ON THE STATE'S

00:46:42.667 --> 00:46:46.070 region:rollup2
CHANGING POPULATION AND THE GOOD

00:46:44.468 --> 00:46:47.738 region:rollup2
NEWS IS THAT AS HANS MENTIONED

00:46:46.070 --> 00:46:49.573 region:rollup2
OUR PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS HAVE

00:46:47.738 --> 00:46:51.208 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY INCREASED THEIR OUT

00:46:49.573 --> 00:46:53.377 region:rollup2
RATE OF COMPLETION FOR MANY

00:46:51.208 --> 00:46:54.345 region:rollup2
ADULTS AND SO THAT. IS BEGINNING

00:46:53.377 --> 00:46:55.546 region:rollup2
TO HELP US THINK ABOUT HOW WE

00:46:54.345 --> 00:46:57.114 region:rollup2
CLOSE THAT GAP.

00:46:55.546 --> 00:46:58.215 region:rollup2
AT THE SAME TIME

00:46:57.114 --> 00:46:59.750 region:rollup2
DESPITE THEIR SIGNIFICANT

00:46:58.215 --> 00:47:01.385 region:rollup2
EFFORTS WE STILL CONTINUE TO SEE

00:46:59.750 --> 00:47:03.020 region:rollup2
A SIGNIFICANT GAP BETWEEN WHAT

00:47:01.385 --> 00:47:04.922 region:rollup2
THE STATUS FORECAST

00:47:03.020 --> 00:47:05.690 region:rollup2
PRODUCE AND WHAT IT ACTUALLY

00:47:04.922 --> 00:47:06.691 region:rollup2
SHOULD PRODUCE IF WERE TO BE

00:47:05.690 --> 00:47:08.693 region:rollup2
AWARE AMONGST ONE OF THOSE TOP

00:47:06.691 --> 00:47:10.127 region:rollup2
TEN STATES.

00:47:08.693 --> 00:47:12.196 region:rollup2
THE PROBLEM WE FACE IS THAT IS

00:47:10.127 --> 00:47:13.964 region:rollup2
THAT WE CAN'T REALLY CLOSE THAT

00:47:12.196 --> 00:47:14.999 region:rollup2
DEGREE OF PRODUCTION GAP.

00:47:13.964 --> 00:47:17.568 region:rollup2
THE CURRENT PACE THAT WERE OUT

00:47:14.999 --> 00:47:19.870 region:rollup2
ON BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE.

00:47:17.568 --> 00:47:21.505 region:rollup2
SO YOU KNOW EVERYONE NOW TALKS

00:47:19.870 --> 00:47:23.140 region:rollup2
ABOUT WILL WE NEED TO STAY. AND

00:47:21.505 --> 00:47:24.809 region:rollup2
STATE GOAL WOULD BE GREAT I END

00:47:23.140 --> 00:47:26.577 region:rollup2
BUT TO BE CLEAR LIKE THE STATE

00:47:24.809 --> 00:47:27.078 region:rollup2
GOAL AROUND TO GREET HIM AND IS

00:47:26.577 --> 00:47:28.345 region:rollup2
NOT A BE ALL AND END ALL

00:47:27.078 --> 00:47:29.180 region:rollup2
STRATEGY.

00:47:28.345 --> 00:47:31.248 region:rollup2
AT I THINK IT'S AN ESSENTIAL

00:47:29.180 --> 00:47:33.351 region:rollup2
COMPONENT FOR HOW WE THINK ABOUT

00:47:31.248 --> 00:47:34.251 region:rollup2
FURTHER PROMOTING COLLABORATION

00:47:33.351 --> 00:47:36.120 region:rollup2
AND COORDINATION ACROSS AN

00:47:34.251 --> 00:47:37.555 region:rollup2
INSTITUTIONAL SEGMENTS AND

00:47:36.120 --> 00:47:39.557 region:rollup2
ALIGNED WITH. THE WORK THAT YOU

00:47:37.555 --> 00:47:41.859 region:rollup2
ALL OF POLICYMAKERS DO BECAUSE

00:47:39.557 --> 00:47:42.727 region:rollup2
IT REALLY HELPS TO COMMUNICATE A

00:47:41.859 --> 00:47:44.328 region:rollup2
PUBLIC AGENDA FOR HIGHER

00:47:42.727 --> 00:47:46.230 region:rollup2
EDUCATION AND THAT IS IN FACT

00:47:44.328 --> 00:47:48.332 region:rollup2
WHAT THE STATE SORELY NEEDS.

00:47:46.230 --> 00:47:49.233 region:rollup2
LIKE MY COLLEAGUES AT PP I SEE

00:47:48.332 --> 00:47:51.001 region:rollup2
WE THOUGHT ABOUT THE VARIOUS

00:47:49.233 --> 00:47:52.303 region:rollup2
POLICY CONSIDERATIONS THAT WILL

00:47:51.001 --> 00:47:53.437 region:rollup2
MOST MEANINGFULLY HELP TO

00:47:52.303 --> 00:47:54.739 region:rollup2
ESTABLISH.

00:47:53.437 --> 00:47:56.540 region:rollup2
DEGREE ITAIM INCREASE TO GREET

00:47:54.739 --> 00:47:57.975 region:rollup2
HIM AND REACH A GOAL AND WE

00:47:56.540 --> 00:47:59.577 region:rollup2
AGREE THAT PAYING ATTENTION TO

00:47:57.975 --> 00:48:00.878 region:rollup2
ENROLLMENT ON TRANSFERS IS A

00:47:59.577 --> 00:48:02.313 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT PART OF THAT BUT WE

00:48:00.878 --> 00:48:04.014 region:rollup2
RECOMMEND THAT YOU THINK ABOUT

00:48:02.313 --> 00:48:05.416 region:rollup2
EXPANDING THE MODEL. TO DEVELOP

00:48:04.014 --> 00:48:06.817 region:rollup2
DEGREE GOALS THAT INCLUDE NOT

00:48:05.416 --> 00:48:08.185 region:rollup2
ONLY IN PUTS.

00:48:06.817 --> 00:48:09.487 region:rollup2
BUT ALSO FOCUSED ON THE OUTPUTS

00:48:08.185 --> 00:48:11.489 region:rollup2
THAT LEADS EQUITABLE OUTCOMES

00:48:09.487 --> 00:48:13.424 region:rollup2
AND SERVE THE STATE'S ECONOMIES.

00:48:11.489 --> 00:48:15.292 region:rollup2
DEGREE COMPLETION IS THE MOST

00:48:13.424 --> 00:48:16.060 region:rollup2
OBVIOUS OUTPUT TO CONSIDER BUT

00:48:15.292 --> 00:48:17.361 region:rollup2
ARTICULATING A SET A GOAL

00:48:16.060 --> 00:48:19.363 region:rollup2
CENTERED ON DEGREE COMPLETION

00:48:17.361 --> 00:48:21.298 region:rollup2
REQUIRES PAYING ATTENTION TO

00:48:19.363 --> 00:48:22.800 region:rollup2
MORE THAN JUST THE TOTAL NUMBER.

00:48:21.298 --> 00:48:24.568 region:rollup2
IT OUT IT'S ALSO ABOUT WHO THOSE

00:48:22.800 --> 00:48:25.903 region:rollup2
DEGREES GO TO WHERE THEY'RE

00:48:24.568 --> 00:48:27.805 region:rollup2
LOCATED AND HOW THEY SUPPORT OUR

00:48:25.903 --> 00:48:29.573 region:rollup2
REGIONAL ECONOMIES.

00:48:27.805 --> 00:48:30.841 region:rollup2
CONCEPTUALLY WE THINK THEREFORE

00:48:29.573 --> 00:48:32.042 region:rollup2
CRITICAL CONSIDERATIONS TO

00:48:30.841 --> 00:48:33.878 region:rollup2
ESTABLISHING MEANINGFUL RESPONSE

00:48:32.042 --> 00:48:35.246 region:rollup2
OF GOALS.

00:48:33.878 --> 00:48:36.881 region:rollup2
FIRST DEPICTED REPRODUCTION

00:48:35.246 --> 00:48:39.049 region:rollup2
OUGHT TO ALIGN WITH GROWING

00:48:36.881 --> 00:48:40.284 region:rollup2
OCCUPATIONAL DEMANDS.

00:48:39.049 --> 00:48:41.585 region:rollup2
THE LARGEST OCCUPATIONS THAT

00:48:40.284 --> 00:48:43.654 region:rollup2
REQUIRE DEGREE BY TWENTY TWENTY

00:48:41.585 --> 00:48:45.122 region:rollup2
FIVE ENCOMPASS A WIDELY DIVERSE

00:48:43.654 --> 00:48:46.657 region:rollup2
SPECTRUM.

00:48:45.122 --> 00:48:48.659 region:rollup2
BY THAT TIME THE STATE WILL NEED

00:48:46.657 --> 00:48:50.861 region:rollup2
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF HEALTH

00:48:48.659 --> 00:48:52.263 region:rollup2
PROFESSIONALS TEACHERS STEM

00:48:50.861 --> 00:48:54.231 region:rollup2
PROFESSIONALS FINANCE EXPERTS

00:48:52.263 --> 00:48:55.499 region:rollup2
THE LIST GOES ON.

00:48:54.231 --> 00:48:57.134 region:rollup2
CLOSING THE GAP BY PRODUCING

00:48:55.499 --> 00:48:58.669 region:rollup2
DEGREES IN ONLY ONE OR A FEW OF

00:48:57.134 --> 00:49:00.104 region:rollup2
THESE FIELDS WOULD BE A FAILURE

00:48:58.669 --> 00:49:01.539 region:rollup2
FOR THE STATE.

00:49:00.104 --> 00:49:03.674 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE

00:49:01.539 --> 00:49:04.575 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE THE CAPACITY

00:49:03.674 --> 00:49:06.110 region:rollup2
CAPITAL AND THE INCENTIVES IN

00:49:04.575 --> 00:49:07.211 region:rollup2
PLACE.

00:49:06.110 --> 00:49:08.512 region:rollup2
TO SUPPORT INSTITUTIONS IN

00:49:07.211 --> 00:49:10.414 region:rollup2
PRODUCING DEGREES BUT OFFERED

00:49:08.512 --> 00:49:12.550 region:rollup2
THEM BEST LONG TERM OPPORTUNITY

00:49:10.414 --> 00:49:14.251 region:rollup2
TO STUDENTS AND RESPOND TO THE

00:49:12.550 --> 00:49:15.586 region:rollup2
CHANGING NEEDS OF OUR ECONOMY.

00:49:14.251 --> 00:49:17.455 region:rollup2
THIS REQUIRES THAT THE MODEL

00:49:15.586 --> 00:49:19.023 region:rollup2
THAT YOU ALL THINK ABOUT. ITS.

00:49:17.455 --> 00:49:20.457 region:rollup2
BE USED TO ESTABLISH GOALS THAT

00:49:19.023 --> 00:49:22.059 region:rollup2
ARE ATTUNED TO THE DIVERSE

00:49:20.457 --> 00:49:24.728 region:rollup2
MISSIONS AND CAPACITIES OF OUR

00:49:22.059 --> 00:49:26.163 region:rollup2
INSTITUTIONAL SEGMENTS.

00:49:24.728 --> 00:49:27.565 region:rollup2
SECOND DEGREE GOALS MUST BE

00:49:26.163 --> 00:49:29.633 region:rollup2
RESPONSIVE TO VARIATIONS

00:49:27.565 --> 00:49:31.135 region:rollup2
EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT.

00:49:29.633 --> 00:49:32.203 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA IS HOME TO A RICH

00:49:31.135 --> 00:49:33.504 region:rollup2
DIVERSITY OF CULTURES AND

00:49:32.203 --> 00:49:35.406 region:rollup2
BUSINESS COMMUNITIES THAT AFFORD

00:49:33.504 --> 00:49:37.041 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE MOST THRIVING LOCAL

00:49:35.406 --> 00:49:38.742 region:rollup2
ECONOMIES. IN THE WORLD.

00:49:37.041 --> 00:49:39.243 region:rollup2
INCREASINGLY STATEWIDE DEGREE

00:49:38.742 --> 00:49:41.045 region:rollup2
ATTAINMENT IS A NET WHEN

00:49:39.243 --> 00:49:42.646 region:rollup2
HOWEVER.

00:49:41.045 --> 00:49:44.048 region:rollup2
REALISTIC GOALS TO ACCOMPLISH

00:49:42.646 --> 00:49:44.481 region:rollup2
THIS SHOULD BE CUSTOMIZED TO

00:49:44.048 --> 00:49:45.850 region:rollup2
ACCOUNT FOR REGIONAL

00:49:44.481 --> 00:49:47.017 region:rollup2
DIFFERENCES.

00:49:45.850 --> 00:49:48.052 region:rollup2
AN EQUITABLE APPROACH TO

00:49:47.017 --> 00:49:49.753 region:rollup2
INCREASING DEGREE PRODUCTION

00:49:48.052 --> 00:49:51.822 region:rollup2
ACROSS THE STATE.

00:49:49.753 --> 00:49:55.259 region:rollup2
WOULD UP DEVELOP A MODEL THAT

00:49:51.822 --> 00:49:57.328 region:rollup2
CONSIDERS REGIONAL CONTACTS.

00:49:55.259 --> 00:49:58.429 region:rollup2
THIRD WE MUST BE ACKNOWLEDGE

00:49:57.328 --> 00:49:59.597 region:rollup2
THAT REGIONAL DIFFERENCE IN

00:49:58.429 --> 00:50:02.132 region:rollup2
WORKFORCE NEEDS AND LOCAL

00:49:59.597 --> 00:50:03.734 region:rollup2
INSTITUTIONS ABILITY TO RESPOND

00:50:02.132 --> 00:50:04.301 region:rollup2
TO THOSE NEEDS ARE ALSO A

00:50:03.734 --> 00:50:05.636 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT COMPONENT OF THE

00:50:04.301 --> 00:50:06.904 region:rollup2
ISSUE.

00:50:05.636 --> 00:50:08.906 region:rollup2
WERE NOT ADVOCATING FOR AN

PRESCRIBED WHAT DEGREES ARE

00:50:13.177 --> 00:50:16.247 region:rollup2
OFFERED IN EACH REGION.

00:50:14.712 --> 00:50:17.948 region:rollup2
HOWEVER THE MAJORITY OF U. S.

00:50:16.247 --> 00:50:19.917 region:rollup2
COLLEGE STUDENTS ATTEND SCHOOL

00:50:17.948 --> 00:50:21.318 region:rollup2
WITHIN FIFTY MILES OF THEIR HOME

00:50:19.917 --> 00:50:23.020 region:rollup2
AND ITS NECESSARY THAT STUDENTS

00:50:21.318 --> 00:50:25.055 region:rollup2
WHO GRADUATE WITH A DEGREE. HAVE

00:50:23.020 --> 00:50:26.524 region:rollup2
A FAIR OPPORTUNITY FOR LONG TERM

00:50:25.055 --> 00:50:27.725 region:rollup2
QUALITY EMPLOYMENT AND THAT

00:50:26.524 --> 00:50:28.726 region:rollup2
EMPLOYERS IN THE REGION HAVE

00:50:27.725 --> 00:50:31.262 region:rollup2
ACCESS

00:50:28.726 --> 00:50:32.730 region:rollup2
COMPETENTLY SKILLED WORKERS.

00:50:31.262 --> 00:50:33.797 region:rollup2
A PRUDENT WAY TO INCORPORATE

00:50:32.730 --> 00:50:35.299 region:rollup2
THIS INTO IT DEGREE ATTAINMENT

00:50:33.797 --> 00:50:36.300 region:rollup2
GOAL WOULD BE TO DEVELOP A MODEL

00:50:35.299 --> 00:50:37.801 region:rollup2
THAT INCORPORATES JOB PLACEMENT

00:50:36.300 --> 00:50:39.403 region:rollup2

00:50:37.801 --> 00:50:40.504 region:rollup2
THE PATIENT PLACEMENT RATES AND

00:50:39.403 --> 00:50:43.541 region:rollup2
TIME TO EMPLOYMENT RATES FOR

00:50:40.504 --> 00:50:44.742 region:rollup2
GRADUATES.

00:50:43.541 --> 00:50:46.343 region:rollup2
FINALLY THIS REGIONAL LIVE

00:50:44.742 --> 00:50:47.878 region:rollup2
METHODOLOGY CAN AND SHOULD BE

00:50:46.343 --> 00:50:49.346 region:rollup2

RACE AND GENDER.

00:50:51.448 --> 00:50:54.552 region:rollup2
TO DEMONSTRATE THIS WE ANALYZED

00:50:52.883 --> 00:50:56.320 region:rollup2
ATTAINMENT DATA BY RACE AND

00:50:54.552 --> 00:50:58.722 region:rollup2
GENDER AND ONE OF OUR FAVORITE

REGIONS THE INLAND EMPIRE.

00:50:58.722 --> 00:51:02.026 region:rollup2
ALARMINGLY LATINOS WHO MAKE UP

00:51:01.025 --> 00:51:03.627 region:rollup2
ABOUT HALF OF THE TOTAL

00:51:02.026 --> 00:51:05.029 region:rollup2
POPULATION IN THIS REGION HAVE

00:51:03.627 --> 00:51:06.597 region:rollup2
DRAMATICALLY LOWER RATES OF

DEGREE COMPLETION COMPLETION

00:51:06.597 --> 00:51:10.067 region:rollup2
COMPARED TO OTHER GROUPS.

00:51:08.632 --> 00:51:11.735 region:rollup2
THIS IS NO MATHEMATICALLY

00:51:10.067 --> 00:51:13.170 region:rollup2
THERE'S NO MATHEMATICALLY VIABLE

00:51:11.735 --> 00:51:14.905 region:rollup2
PATH FORWARD TO INCREASE

00:51:13.170 --> 00:51:15.639 region:rollup2
REGIONAL DEGREE PRODUCTION

00:51:14.905 --> 00:51:17.975 region:rollup2
WITHOUT ADDRESSING THE

00:51:15.639 --> 00:51:19.176 region:rollup2
INEQUITIES OF COMPLETION GAPS.

00:51:17.975 --> 00:51:21.111 region:rollup2
SPLAYED ACROSS DIFFERENT

00:51:19.176 --> 00:51:22.913 region:rollup2
POPULATIONS.

00:51:21.111 --> 00:51:23.380 region:rollup2
TO REACH A RACIALLY EQUITABLE

ATTAINMENT.

00:51:25.582 --> 00:51:28.252 region:rollup2
GOAL SHOULD BE CONTEXTUALIZED TO

00:51:27.217 --> 00:51:30.421 region:rollup2
COUNT FOR THE PROGRESS MADE

00:51:28.252 --> 00:51:33.657 region:rollup2
TOWARDS ELIMINATING ENROLLMENT

00:51:30.421 --> 00:51:34.658 region:rollup2
AND COMPLETION DISPARITIES.

00:51:33.657 --> 00:51:35.559 region:rollup2
IF YOU CONTINUE TO THINK ABOUT

00:51:34.658 --> 00:51:37.361 region:rollup2
HOW TO IMPLEMENT DEGREE

DEGREES OUR STATE NEEDS BUT WHAT

00:51:40.898 --> 00:51:43.734 region:rollup2
MAJORS AND WHAT DEGREES ARE

NEEDED. TO FUEL THE REGIONAL

00:51:43.734 --> 00:51:47.237 region:rollup2
ECONOMIES AND HOW WE OUGHT TO

00:51:45.803 --> 00:51:49.907 region:rollup2
PRIORITIZE THOSE.

00:51:47.237 --> 00:51:51.408 region:rollup2
HIGHEST EDUCATIONAL NEED.

I'M LIKE TO GO BACK TO.

00:52:28.512 --> 00:52:32.182 region:rollup2
IT'S A GOOD OBSERVATION IS BEING

00:52:29.947 --> 00:52:33.851 region:rollup2
MADE IS THAT THE REGIONALISM

00:52:32.182 --> 00:52:35.386 region:rollup2
THAT WE NEED TO BE CONSIDERING.

00:52:33.851 --> 00:52:37.054 region:rollup2
HOW?

00:52:35.386 --> 00:52:38.689 region:rollup2
HOW MUCH?

00:52:37.054 --> 00:52:39.690 region:rollup2
CAN WE BE LOOKING ALSO AT HOW

00:52:38.689 --> 00:52:41.291 region:rollup2
NIMBLE WE NEED TO BE AS THAT

00:52:39.690 --> 00:52:42.626 region:rollup2
CHANGES.

00:52:41.291 --> 00:52:43.694 region:rollup2
FOR EXAMPLE IF WE'RE GOING TO

00:52:42.626 --> 00:52:46.063 region:rollup2
SAY THE INLAND EMPIRE IS GONNA

00:52:43.694 --> 00:52:47.765 region:rollup2
HAVE A LOT OF NEEDS FOR NURSES.

00:52:46.063 --> 00:52:48.999 region:rollup2
OR PEOPLE WITH NURSING DEGREES

00:52:47.765 --> 00:52:50.334 region:rollup2
OR SOME SORT OF MEDICAL

00:52:48.999 --> 00:52:52.536 region:rollup2
ASSISTANCE DEGREE.

00:52:50.334 --> 00:52:54.338 region:rollup2
AND POPULATIONS CHANGE THEY

00:52:52.536 --> 00:52:56.774 region:rollup2
MOVE AND YOU WANT PEOPLE TO BE

00:52:54.338 --> 00:52:58.609 region:rollup2
AS MOBILE AS POSSIBLE. AND AS

00:52:56.774 --> 00:53:01.178 region:rollup2
YOU'RE LOOKING AT THESE NUMBERS.

00:52:58.609 --> 00:53:02.780 region:rollup2
HOW HOW MUCH RECONSIDERING

00:53:01.178 --> 00:53:04.481 region:rollup2
MOBILITY AND THE PEOPLE UP AND

00:53:02.780 --> 00:53:05.349 region:rollup2
MOVE AND?

00:53:04.481 --> 00:53:06.283 region:rollup2
SPLIT AFTER THEY GET A DEGREE

00:53:05.349 --> 00:53:07.785 region:rollup2
THEY DON'T NECESSARILY STAY

00:53:06.283 --> 00:53:09.219 region:rollup2
RIGHT WHERE THEY'RE AT.

00:53:07.785 --> 00:53:10.187 region:rollup2
SO WE WANT TO HAVE A DEGREE

00:53:09.219 --> 00:53:11.522 region:rollup2
THAT'S PORTABLE WE ONE HAVE THE

00:53:10.187 --> 00:53:13.691 region:rollup2
SKILLS OR PORTABLE TO GO WHERE

00:53:11.522 --> 00:53:15.225 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WANT TO GO BUT. I'M CAN

00:53:13.691 --> 00:53:16.393 region:rollup2
YOU COMMENT AT ALL ON THAT

00:53:15.225 --> 00:53:17.661 region:rollup2
BECAUSE YOU KNOW REGIONALISM NOW

00:53:16.393 --> 00:53:19.930 region:rollup2
I MEAN I THINK THE REGIONALISM

00:53:17.661 --> 00:53:20.564 region:rollup2
QUESTION IS IS AN IMPORTANT ONE

00:53:19.930 --> 00:53:20.731 region:rollup2
BECAUSE CERTAINLY YOU DON'T WANT

00:53:20.564 --> 00:53:21.432 region:rollup2
TO.

00:53:20.731 --> 00:53:23.267 region:rollup2
.

00:53:21.432 --> 00:53:24.802 region:rollup2
OVERLY TYPE PRESCRIBE PEOPLE'S

00:53:23.267 --> 00:53:25.402 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY STRUCTURE RIGHT SO

00:53:24.802 --> 00:53:27.137 region:rollup2
YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET YOUR

00:53:25.402 --> 00:53:28.739 region:rollup2
DEGREE AND TAKE IT WHERE EVER

00:53:27.137 --> 00:53:30.374 region:rollup2
YOU WOULD LIKE TO GO.

00:53:28.739 --> 00:53:31.975 region:rollup2
THE SAME TIME I THINK PART OF

00:53:30.374 --> 00:53:32.976 region:rollup2
THE CHALLENGES WE HAVE SUCH ON

00:53:31.975 --> 00:53:34.211 region:rollup2
EVEN.

00:53:32.976 --> 00:53:35.379 region:rollup2
THEY'RE SUCH GREAT REGIONAL

00:53:34.211 --> 00:53:36.814 region:rollup2
DISPARITIES IN THE STATE OF

00:53:35.379 --> 00:53:38.115 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA SO IF YOU LOOK AT THE

00:53:36.814 --> 00:53:39.416 region:rollup2
SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY OBVIOUSLY

00:53:38.115 --> 00:53:41.552 region:rollup2
COMPARED TO.

00:53:39.416 --> 00:53:42.953 region:rollup2
HOLLYWOOD INLAND EMPIRE ARE

00:53:41.552 --> 00:53:44.822 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE CENTRAL VALLEY THEIR

00:53:42.953 --> 00:53:46.523 region:rollup2
REAL DISPARITIES IN TERMS OF THE

00:53:44.822 --> 00:53:47.458 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY STRUCTURE THERE AND

00:53:46.523 --> 00:53:49.293 region:rollup2
I THINK THE CHALLENGE THAT WE

00:53:47.458 --> 00:53:51.261 region:rollup2
FACE WITH THINKING ABOUT SOME OF

00:53:49.293 --> 00:53:53.430 region:rollup2
THOSE REGIONAL OPPORTUNITIES AS.

00:53:51.261 --> 00:53:54.765 region:rollup2
OUR BEST LABOR MARKET DATA COMES

00:53:53.430 --> 00:53:55.866 region:rollup2
AS CLOSE TO TO THE YEAR WERE

00:53:54.765 --> 00:53:57.034 region:rollup2
STUDENTS ARE GRADUATING WHICH

00:53:55.866 --> 00:53:58.302 region:rollup2
DOESN'T REALLY GIVE OUR

00:53:57.034 --> 00:53:59.970 region:rollup2
INSTITUTIONS THE TIME THAT THEY

00:53:58.302 --> 00:54:02.172 region:rollup2
NEED. TO RE CALIBRATE AND YOU

00:53:59.970 --> 00:54:04.541 region:rollup2
KNOW YOU CAN'T WAIT UNTIL. NOW

00:54:02.172 --> 00:54:06.577 region:rollup2
TO TO GET YOU KNOW FIVE HUNDRED

00:54:04.541 --> 00:54:08.212 region:rollup2
MORE NURSES FOR SEPTEMBER SO

00:54:06.577 --> 00:54:09.980 region:rollup2
THERE IS A TENSION THERE BETWEEN

00:54:08.212 --> 00:54:11.248 region:rollup2
HOW WE THINK ABOUT WHAT THE

00:54:09.980 --> 00:54:13.617 region:rollup2
REGIONAL OPPORTUNITIES ARE

00:54:11.248 --> 00:54:15.619 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY. AND HOW WE NEED TO.

00:54:13.617 --> 00:54:17.688 region:rollup2
ADJUST AND FLEX OUR

00:54:15.619 --> 00:54:19.156 region:rollup2
INSTITUTIONAL AND INSTITUTIONS

00:54:17.688 --> 00:54:19.690 region:rollup2
BE ABLE TO CREATE THE KINDS OF

00:54:19.156 --> 00:54:22.392 region:rollup2
OCCUPATIONS THAT THAT ARE

00:54:19.690 --> 00:54:24.828 region:rollup2
NEEDED.

00:54:22.392 --> 00:54:26.497 region:rollup2
AND THE THIS MAYBE FOR MISTER

00:54:24.828 --> 00:54:28.732 region:rollup2
JOHNSON HAD JUST SORT OF LOOKING

00:54:26.497 --> 00:54:31.635 region:rollup2
AT THE. THE ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE

00:54:28.732 --> 00:54:34.004 region:rollup2
HERE ABOUT THE DEGREE GAP.

00:54:31.635 --> 00:54:34.438 region:rollup2
AND WHERE WE DEFINING IS A

00:54:34.004 --> 00:54:35.005 region:rollup2
DEGREE.

00:54:34.438 --> 00:54:36.774 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WHEN I VISIT WITH

00:54:35.005 --> 00:54:37.808 region:rollup2
EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEES.

00:54:36.774 --> 00:54:38.776 region:rollup2
THAT WE'RE THE NUMBER ONE

00:54:37.808 --> 00:54:39.710 region:rollup2
ISSUES THAT THEY MENTION IS JUST

00:54:38.776 --> 00:54:40.277 region:rollup2
SOMEONE WHO HAS THE SKILLS

00:54:39.710 --> 00:54:41.145 region:rollup2
DOESN'T HAVE TO BE FOR YOUR

00:54:40.277 --> 00:54:42.780 region:rollup2
DEGREE.

00:54:41.145 --> 00:54:44.548 region:rollup2
AND I'M A VERY BIG PROPONENT OF

00:54:42.780 --> 00:54:46.850 region:rollup2
FOR YOUR DEGREE BUT I'M IS ARE

00:54:44.548 --> 00:54:48.919 region:rollup2
WE LOOKING AT MANY OF THE TRADE.

00:54:46.850 --> 00:54:49.686 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITIES THAT FOR WHICH WE

00:54:48.919 --> 00:54:52.055 region:rollup2
CAN HAVE CERTIFICATIONS ARE

00:54:49.686 --> 00:54:55.092 region:rollup2
DEGREES ARE DIFFERENT PATHS.

00:54:52.055 --> 00:54:56.160 region:rollup2
IS THAT INCLUDED IN THIS.

00:54:55.092 --> 00:54:58.128 region:rollup2
ANALYSIS OF THEIRS

00:54:56.160 --> 00:54:59.496 region:rollup2
OF HOW.

00:54:58.128 --> 00:55:00.931 region:rollup2
BROUGHT THE GAP IS BETWEEN THE

00:54:59.496 --> 00:55:01.965 region:rollup2
DEGREES WE NEED BECAUSE THIS

00:55:00.931 --> 00:55:04.368 region:rollup2
LOOKS MOSTLY LIKE NEED FOR YOUR

00:55:01.965 --> 00:55:07.004 region:rollup2
DEGREE SO SO RIGHT SO SO WE

00:55:04.368 --> 00:55:08.839 region:rollup2
FOCUSED OUR IN THIS AREN'T. WORK

00:55:07.004 --> 00:55:10.274 region:rollup2
ARE ON FOUR YEAR DEGREES BASHERS

00:55:08.839 --> 00:55:12.509 region:rollup2
GREASE FOR A COUPLE REASONS

00:55:10.274 --> 00:55:13.677 region:rollup2
FIRST THE VAST MAJORITY OF

THE CONNIE WHICH CONTINUES TO

00:55:37.334 --> 00:55:38.735 region:rollup2
DESPITE WHAT YOU MIGHT HAVE

00:55:37.901 --> 00:55:40.470 region:rollup2
READ.

00:55:38.735 --> 00:55:42.773 region:rollup2
REWARD COLLEGE GRADUATES WHAT

00:55:40.470 --> 00:55:43.574 region:rollup2
THE BASHERS AGREE MORE THAN ANY

00:55:42.773 --> 00:55:45.876 region:rollup2
OTHER.

00:55:43.574 --> 00:55:48.378 region:rollup2
MOSTLY MORE THAN LESS EDUCATED

00:55:45.876 --> 00:55:51.215 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS INCLUDING ARE THOSE

00:55:48.378 --> 00:55:54.484 region:rollup2
WHO HAVE SOME COLLEGE OR THOSE

00:55:51.215 --> 00:55:55.419 region:rollup2
WHO HAVE CERTIFICATES ON AVERAGE

00:55:54.484 --> 00:55:56.620 region:rollup2
NOW. LET ME UNPACK THAT LITTLE

00:55:55.419 --> 00:55:58.155 region:rollup2
BIT.

00:55:56.620 --> 00:55:59.223 region:rollup2
I WE'VE DONE WORK IN MONDAY'S

00:55:58.155 --> 00:56:00.123 region:rollup2
DONE WORK ALSO SO LONG THEY

00:55:59.223 --> 00:56:01.592 region:rollup2
MIGHT WANT TO ADD TO THIS

00:56:00.123 --> 00:56:02.893 region:rollup2
BECAUSE LANDET HOUSE DEVELOP

00:56:01.592 --> 00:56:04.595 region:rollup2
PROJECTION SIMILAR TO OURS

00:56:02.893 --> 00:56:06.496 region:rollup2
EXCEPT HERS ARE. BUT SHE'S ALSO

00:56:04.595 --> 00:56:08.298 region:rollup2
ADDED CERTIFICATES TOOK TO THE

00:56:06.496 --> 00:56:09.967 region:rollup2
NUMBER. ARM AND IT'S ROUGHLY

00:56:08.298 --> 00:56:11.368 region:rollup2
DOUBLES BUT THE NUMBER BUT THAT

00:56:09.967 --> 00:56:14.404 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAVE THE ONE POINT ONE

00:56:11.368 --> 00:56:15.005 region:rollup2
MILLION BECOMES TWO POINT THREE

00:56:14.404 --> 00:56:16.540 region:rollup2
SOMETHING LIKE WHAT FOR HALF A

00:56:15.005 --> 00:56:18.742 region:rollup2
POINT FOR.

00:56:16.540 --> 00:56:19.409 region:rollup2
AS A WE DON'T MARKET PP I SEE

00:56:18.742 --> 00:56:20.677 region:rollup2
LOOKING UP HIGH VALUE

00:56:19.409 --> 00:56:21.411 region:rollup2
CERTIFICATES PURSES MAYBE NOT SO

00:56:20.677 --> 00:56:22.279 region:rollup2
HIGH VALUE CERTIFICATES WE

00:56:21.411 --> 00:56:22.880 region:rollup2
STARTED OUT WORK LOOKING AT

00:56:22.279 --> 00:56:23.981 region:rollup2
HEALTH AND OBVIOUSLY THE MOST

00:56:22.880 --> 00:56:25.616 region:rollup2
HIGH VALUE CERTIFICATE YOU CAN

00:56:23.981 --> 00:56:27.217 region:rollup2
EARN AND HEALTH IS ACTUALLY CALL

00:56:25.616 --> 00:56:28.285 region:rollup2
VOCATIONAL DEGREE IS AN

00:56:27.217 --> 00:56:30.220 region:rollup2
ASSOCIATES DEGREE IN NURSING.

00:56:28.285 --> 00:56:31.722 region:rollup2
MEDICAL ASSISTING DOESN'T GET

00:56:30.220 --> 00:56:34.124 region:rollup2
YOU MUCH ANNA IN THE LABOR

00:56:31.722 --> 00:56:36.426 region:rollup2
MARKET AYE IT DOES ALLOW YOU

00:56:34.124 --> 00:56:38.395 region:rollup2
THOUGH VERY IMPORTANTLY. TO MOVE

00:56:36.426 --> 00:56:39.296 region:rollup2
ARE OUT OF INDUSTRIES WHERE

00:56:38.395 --> 00:56:40.864 region:rollup2
MAYBE THERE ISN'T A LOT OF

00:56:39.296 --> 00:56:43.367 region:rollup2
UPSIDE POTENTIAL RETELL FOR

00:56:40.864 --> 00:56:44.701 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE TO HEALTH WHERE THERE IS

00:56:43.367 --> 00:56:46.270 region:rollup2
A LOT MORE UPSIDE POTENTIAL AND

00:56:44.701 --> 00:56:47.938 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE PIECES THAT WE'VE

00:56:46.270 --> 00:56:49.306 region:rollup2
DONE LOOKING AT CERTIFICATES.

00:56:47.938 --> 00:56:50.874 region:rollup2
AND OF FOR THOSE WHO ARE IN A

00:56:49.306 --> 00:56:53.443 region:rollup2
MEDICAL ASSISTING DEGREE FOR

00:56:50.874 --> 00:56:54.845 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE IS THAT A NUMBER OF

00:56:53.443 --> 00:56:56.446 region:rollup2
THOSE ARE PEOPLE WHO EARNED

00:56:54.845 --> 00:56:57.881 region:rollup2
THOSE DEGREES WILL GO ON AND

00:56:56.446 --> 00:56:59.416 region:rollup2
EARN HIGHER DEGREES AND

00:56:57.881 --> 00:57:01.285 region:rollup2
CERTIFICATES AND HEALTH. I

00:56:59.416 --> 00:57:01.818 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES INCLUDING ALL THE WAY

00:57:01.285 --> 00:57:03.186 region:rollup2
UP TO REGISTERED NURSE SO

00:57:01.818 --> 00:57:06.990 region:rollup2
THAT'S.

00:57:03.186 --> 00:57:09.126 region:rollup2
STEPWISE OF BUILDING OF DEGREES

00:57:06.990 --> 00:57:10.427 region:rollup2
I'D CERTIFICATES IS A STRATEGY

00:57:09.126 --> 00:57:11.561 region:rollup2
THAT STUDENTS ARE EMPLOYING

00:57:10.427 --> 00:57:13.964 region:rollup2
COLLEGES ARE INCREASINGLY

00:57:11.561 --> 00:57:15.599 region:rollup2
IDENTIFYING AS A WAY TO IMPROVE

00:57:13.964 --> 00:57:17.467 region:rollup2
OUTCOMES FOR STUDENTS WHO MIGHT

00:57:15.599 --> 00:57:19.303 region:rollup2
BE EARNING.CERTIFICATES THAT

00:57:17.467 --> 00:57:20.537 region:rollup2
ARE RELATIVELY LOW INCOME OUR

00:57:19.303 --> 00:57:22.339 region:rollup2
LOW OF LOW VALUE AT THE START

00:57:20.537 --> 00:57:23.006 region:rollup2
HAVING SAID THAT THE VAST

00:57:22.339 --> 00:57:24.608 region:rollup2
MAJORITY OF STUDENTS WHO ARE THE

00:57:23.006 --> 00:57:26.109 region:rollup2
MEDICAL SYSTEM GREEN NEVER COME

00:57:24.608 --> 00:57:27.144 region:rollup2
BACK AND DON'T EARN. A HIGHER

00:57:26.109 --> 00:57:28.612 region:rollup2
VALUE CERTIFICATES THAT'S

00:57:27.144 --> 00:57:29.680 region:rollup2
ANOTHER CHALLENGE BUT I AGREE

00:57:28.612 --> 00:57:31.648 region:rollup2
WITH YOU THAT THERE'S A LOT OF

00:57:29.680 --> 00:57:33.750 region:rollup2
ROOM IN OUR ECONOMY FOR POST

00:57:31.648 --> 00:57:35.986 region:rollup2
SECONDARY AWARD SHORT OF THE

00:57:33.750 --> 00:57:38.922 region:rollup2
VOUCHERS DEGREE.

00:57:35.986 --> 00:57:40.157 region:rollup2
AND AGAIN LINE BASED ON SOME

00:57:38.922 --> 00:57:43.060 region:rollup2
WORK AND WE'RE DOING SOME WORK

00:57:40.157 --> 00:57:44.127 region:rollup2
ON THAT BUT PLEASE DO NOT.

00:57:43.060 --> 00:57:45.228 region:rollup2
.

00:57:44.127 --> 00:57:45.929 region:rollup2
DISMISS THE TREMENDOUS

00:57:45.228 --> 00:57:47.431 region:rollup2
IMPORTANCE OF THE BACHELORS

MINUTE TO DO WITH THAT WHAT ROLE

00:57:53.737 --> 00:57:57.274 region:rollup2
YOU SEE THE NEED FOR REMEDIATION

00:57:55.706 --> 00:57:58.208 region:rollup2
OR MEDIA WHAT WE'VE BEEN CALLING

00:57:57.274 --> 00:57:59.943 region:rollup2
REMEDIAL.

00:57:58.208 --> 00:58:00.477 region:rollup2
EDUCATION WHEN SOMEONE IS

SCHOOL.

00:58:03.480 --> 00:58:08.151 region:rollup2
IN AND COMPLICATING THE IT'S THE

00:58:06.516 --> 00:58:09.219 region:rollup2
DEGREE GAP AND I KNOW THAT

00:58:08.151 --> 00:58:11.388 region:rollup2
THERE'S BEEN SOME MOVEMENT IN

00:58:09.219 --> 00:58:12.656 region:rollup2
POLICIES WITH SOME OF OUR HIGHER

00:58:11.388 --> 00:58:13.323 region:rollup2
EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS ON THAT.

00:58:12.656 --> 00:58:14.958 region:rollup2
WE'RE GONNA NEED TO WORK ON THAT

00:58:13.323 --> 00:58:16.793 region:rollup2
BUT I'D LIKE TO HAVE YOUR

00:58:14.958 --> 00:58:18.628 region:rollup2
OPINION ON HOW MUCH THAT HAS

00:58:16.793 --> 00:58:19.863 region:rollup2
CONTRIBUTED TO THE DEGREE GAP SO

00:58:18.628 --> 00:58:21.531 region:rollup2
WE'VE GOT A LOT OF WORK LOOKING

00:58:19.863 --> 00:58:23.367 region:rollup2
AT REMEDIATION IN CALIFORNIA'S

00:58:21.531 --> 00:58:24.768 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY COLLEGES. ARE ABOUT

00:58:23.367 --> 00:58:26.103 region:rollup2
EIGHTY PERCENT OF ENTERING

00:58:24.768 --> 00:58:27.637 region:rollup2
COHORTS IN THE PAST WERE

00:58:26.103 --> 00:58:30.474 region:rollup2
IDENTIFIED AS NEEDING

00:58:27.637 --> 00:58:32.442 region:rollup2
REMEDIATION. AND THE VAST

00:58:30.474 --> 00:58:34.544 region:rollup2
MAJORITY OF THOSE STUDENTS NEVER

00:58:32.442 --> 00:58:36.480 region:rollup2
EARNED A CERTIFICATE OR TRANSFER

00:58:34.544 --> 00:58:38.081 region:rollup2
OR AN ASSOCIATE'S DEGREE. AND IN

00:58:36.480 --> 00:58:39.683 region:rollup2

PASS.

00:58:39.683 --> 00:58:42.252 region:rollup2
COLLEGE LEVEL ENGLISH OR MATH

COURSE.

00:58:42.252 --> 00:58:45.922 region:rollup2
WE'VE LOOKED AT REFORMS IN

00:58:43.787 --> 00:58:47.491 region:rollup2
ENGLISH AND MATH OR ENGLISH OF

00:58:45.922 --> 00:58:49.493 region:rollup2
REFORM WORK IS GOING TO BE

EIGHTH HERE IN SACRAMENTO. OUR

00:58:50.961 --> 00:58:54.998 region:rollup2
AND OUR MOUTH REFORM WORK SHOWED

00:58:53.230 --> 00:58:56.800 region:rollup2
THAT ACCELERATED PATHWAYS FOR

00:58:54.998 --> 00:58:58.335 region:rollup2
STUDENTS SERVE THEM MUCH BETTER

00:58:56.800 --> 00:59:00.570 region:rollup2
COMBINING FOR EXAMPLE TO

00:58:58.335 --> 00:59:02.739 region:rollup2
REMEDIATION COURSES. INTO ONE

00:59:00.570 --> 00:59:05.275 region:rollup2
BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY WAS ARE THE

00:59:02.739 --> 00:59:06.810 region:rollup2
STATISTICS PATHWAY. AYE IN MOUTH

00:59:05.275 --> 00:59:08.845 region:rollup2
VERSUS A TRADITIONAL MOUTH

00:59:06.810 --> 00:59:11.081 region:rollup2
PATHWAY LED TO MUCH MUCH BETTER

00:59:08.845 --> 00:59:13.016 region:rollup2
OUTCOMES FOR STUDENTS INCLUDING

00:59:11.081 --> 00:59:14.951 region:rollup2
MORE SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF

00:59:13.016 --> 00:59:17.354 region:rollup2
SUBSEQUENT COLLEGE LEVEL COURSES

00:59:14.951 --> 00:59:19.222 region:rollup2

TRANSFER LATER ON.

00:59:19.222 --> 00:59:22.292 region:rollup2
HAVING SAID ALL THAT MEANWHILE

00:59:20.724 --> 00:59:24.227 region:rollup2
YOU OF THE LEGISLATURE AND

00:59:22.292 --> 00:59:26.830 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR HAVE PASSED BILLS THAT

00:59:24.227 --> 00:59:28.331 region:rollup2
WILL DRAMATICALLY REFORM. HOW

00:59:26.830 --> 00:59:30.400 region:rollup2
REMEDIATION TAKES PLACE IN THE

00:59:28.331 --> 00:59:31.802 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND I KNOW WE

00:59:30.400 --> 00:59:32.736 region:rollup2
HAVE COMMUNITY COLLEGE PEOPLE

00:59:31.802 --> 00:59:35.472 region:rollup2
HERE WHO CAN TALK ABOUT THAT

00:59:32.736 --> 00:59:37.874 region:rollup2
FURTHER? BUT THAT WORK WILL LEAD

00:59:35.472 --> 00:59:38.842 region:rollup2
TO ACHIEVE AT VERY LARGE SHIFT

00:59:37.874 --> 00:59:39.409 region:rollup2
ALREADY SEEN THIS HAPPENING AT

00:59:38.842 --> 00:59:40.677 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE COLLEGES THAT A

00:59:39.409 --> 00:59:42.279 region:rollup2
BENEFIT FOR FRONT OF THESE

00:59:40.677 --> 00:59:44.548 region:rollup2
STRANGERS. LOOKING AT HIGH

00:59:42.279 --> 00:59:46.116 region:rollup2
SCHOOL GRADES AND COURSES AS THE

00:59:44.548 --> 00:59:47.784 region:rollup2
PRIMARY WAY TO PLACE STUDENTS

00:59:46.116 --> 00:59:48.819 region:rollup2
WHICH.

00:59:47.784 --> 00:59:49.986 region:rollup2
IS THE BEST PREDICTOR OF HOW

00:59:48.819 --> 00:59:51.254 region:rollup2
SOON WILL DO IN COLLEGE NOT HOW

00:59:49.986 --> 00:59:54.024 region:rollup2
THEY DO ON A SINGLE PLACEMENT

00:59:51.254 --> 00:59:55.425 region:rollup2
EXAM. AND THAT WORK SHOWS THAT

00:59:54.024 --> 00:59:56.193 region:rollup2
THOSE STUDENTS

00:59:55.425 --> 00:59:58.128 region:rollup2
ABOUT STUDENTS NOW ARE

00:59:56.193 --> 00:59:59.529 region:rollup2
INCREASINGLY.

00:59:58.128 --> 01:00:00.864 region:rollup2
BEING PLACED DIRECTLY INTO

00:59:59.529 --> 01:00:01.865 region:rollup2
COLLEGE LEVEL WORK NOT EVEN

01:00:00.864 --> 01:00:03.867 region:rollup2
BEING HAVE NOT EVEN HAVING TO

01:00:01.865 --> 01:00:05.535 region:rollup2
REMEDIATE AT ALL AND OF COURSE

01:00:03.867 --> 01:00:07.104 region:rollup2
SUCCESS RATES ARE GOING UP

01:00:05.535 --> 01:00:08.438 region:rollup2
TREMENDOUSLY THROUGH BUT. I

01:00:07.104 --> 01:00:09.606 region:rollup2
EXPECT WILL GO UP QUITE A BIT

01:00:08.438 --> 01:00:11.475 region:rollup2
WHICH CREATES A CHALLENGE FOR

01:00:09.606 --> 01:00:14.144 region:rollup2
ALL OF US THEY CAN DOWN THE LINE

01:00:11.475 --> 01:00:16.847 region:rollup2
HOW DO WE ACCOMMODATE. WHAT I I

01:00:14.144 --> 01:00:18.548 region:rollup2
WOULD CALL THE WAVE AND MAYBE

01:00:16.847 --> 01:00:20.150 region:rollup2
THE TIDAL WAVE OF?

01:00:18.548 --> 01:00:21.918 region:rollup2
TRANSFER ELIGIBLE STUDENTS AS

01:00:20.150 --> 01:00:23.086 region:rollup2
THESE REFORMS ARE IMPLEMENTED

01:00:21.918 --> 01:00:25.188 region:rollup2
AND THEY'RE GOING TO BE LOOKING

01:00:23.086 --> 01:00:27.757 region:rollup2
FOREST PLACE AT UC CSU ARE

01:00:25.188 --> 01:00:30.060 region:rollup2
PRIVATE NONPROFIT. AND RIGHT NOW

01:00:27.757 --> 01:00:31.661 region:rollup2
WE DON'T HAVE THE CAPACITY TO

01:00:30.060 --> 01:00:32.662 region:rollup2
HANDLE ABOUT FLOW AND SO I THINK

01:00:31.661 --> 01:00:34.197 region:rollup2
THAT'S A TREMENDOUS CHALLENGE

01:00:32.662 --> 01:00:35.999 region:rollup2
GOING FORWARD NINE WERE VERY

PLACE AND AND WE THINK THEY'RE A

01:00:38.602 --> 01:00:41.872 region:rollup2
STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND

01:00:39.836 --> 01:00:42.739 region:rollup2
AND THE LEGISLATURE. AS WELL AS

01:00:41.872 --> 01:00:43.874 region:rollup2
THE COLLEGES SHOULD PAT

OVER THE YEARS ON THAT THIS

01:01:01.691 --> 01:01:06.263 region:rollup2
GROUP I AS FAR AS THE CAL STATES

01:01:04.427 --> 01:01:08.765 region:rollup2
OF CAL STATE FULLERTON IN MY

01:01:06.263 --> 01:01:11.101 region:rollup2
DISTRICT THE ON THE LARGEST ONE.

01:01:08.765 --> 01:01:12.802 region:rollup2
OF THE CS USE AND THEY ARE

01:01:11.101 --> 01:01:16.106 region:rollup2
MAKING INCREASES IN THEIR

01:01:12.802 --> 01:01:17.941 region:rollup2
TRANSFER PROGRAM AND YET. IT'S

01:01:16.106 --> 01:01:19.509 region:rollup2
STILL NOT WHERE WE WANT IT SO WE

01:01:17.941 --> 01:01:21.144 region:rollup2
HAVE HAD MANY CONVERSATIONS

01:01:19.509 --> 01:01:22.812 region:rollup2
ABOUT HOW DO YOU GET INTO THE

01:01:21.144 --> 01:01:24.781 region:rollup2
NEXT STEP IF THEY ACTUALLY. YOU

01:01:22.812 --> 01:01:27.284 region:rollup2
KNOW DO ATTAIN SOME TYPE OF

01:01:24.781 --> 01:01:29.619 region:rollup2
DEGREE WE DO HAVE THE TRANSFER

01:01:27.284 --> 01:01:30.353 region:rollup2
PROGRAM THING AND YET I'VE HEARD

01:01:29.619 --> 01:01:32.055 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:01:30.353 --> 01:01:33.623 region:rollup2
ANYTIME STUDENTS DON'T KNOW

01:01:32.055 --> 01:01:35.358 region:rollup2
ABOUT IT AND IF THEY DO KNOW

01:01:33.623 --> 01:01:37.027 region:rollup2
ABOUT IT SAVE RT STARTED TAKING

01:01:35.358 --> 01:01:39.029 region:rollup2
COURSEWORK SO THEY CAN'T REALLY

01:01:37.027 --> 01:01:40.797 region:rollup2
FIT INTO THAT. TRANSFER DEGREE

01:01:39.029 --> 01:01:42.566 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS SO IF YOU CAN JUST

01:01:40.797 --> 01:01:43.900 region:rollup2
SPEAK IF YOU HAVE ANY

01:01:42.566 --> 01:01:47.070 region:rollup2
INFORMATION ON.

01:01:43.900 --> 01:01:48.071 region:rollup2
IS THAT WORKING IS IT.

01:01:47.070 --> 01:01:49.739 region:rollup2
WHAT CAN WE DO TO GET THOSE

01:01:48.071 --> 01:01:51.708 region:rollup2
STUDENTS TEND TO LOOK INTO THAT

01:01:49.739 --> 01:01:53.043 region:rollup2
TRANSFER PROGRAM?

01:01:51.708 --> 01:01:54.878 region:rollup2
SO THE ASSOCIATE DEGREE FOR FAST

01:01:53.043 --> 01:01:55.912 region:rollup2
PROGRAM IS A GREAT IDEA AYE AND

01:01:54.878 --> 01:01:57.280 region:rollup2
IT'S DESIGNED TO TRY TO SOLVE

01:01:55.912 --> 01:01:58.915 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE BIG PROBLEMS. WE HAVE

01:01:57.280 --> 01:02:01.585 region:rollup2
WHICH IS.

01:01:58.915 --> 01:02:02.786 region:rollup2
ELIMINATING BARRIERS TO MOVING

01:02:01.585 --> 01:02:04.120 region:rollup2
FROM COMMITTEE ECOLOGIST FOR

01:02:02.786 --> 01:02:05.455 region:rollup2
YOUR CALLER ISN'T SUPPOSED TO

01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:07.190 region:rollup2
MAP OUT FIRST TUNE AND GUARANTEE

01:02:05.455 --> 01:02:08.692 region:rollup2
A STUDENT. A SPOT AT A

01:02:07.190 --> 01:02:11.194 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY

01:02:08.692 --> 01:02:13.496 region:rollup2
CAMPUS ARE IN A MAJOR IF IT IS.

01:02:11.194 --> 01:02:14.464 region:rollup2
HAS HAS DEVELOPED AN AGREEMENT

01:02:13.496 --> 01:02:16.299 region:rollup2
WITH THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE.

01:02:14.464 --> 01:02:18.235 region:rollup2
SO I'M A BIG FAN

01:02:16.299 --> 01:02:20.036 region:rollup2
BUT IT'S IT'S JUST A STOP AND I

01:02:18.235 --> 01:02:21.338 region:rollup2
WOULD SAY ALMOST A BABY STEP IN

01:02:20.036 --> 01:02:22.806 region:rollup2
AYE DIRECTION FOR THE REASONS

01:02:21.338 --> 01:02:23.473 region:rollup2
THAT YOU'VE JUST IDENTIFIED A

01:02:22.806 --> 01:02:24.207 region:rollup2
LOT OF STUDENTS DON'T KNOW ABOUT

01:02:23.473 --> 01:02:25.609 region:rollup2
IT.

01:02:24.207 --> 01:02:27.077 region:rollup2
AND ALSO THE AGREEMENTS ARE

01:02:25.609 --> 01:02:29.012 region:rollup2
BETWEEN.

01:02:27.077 --> 01:02:30.513 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY COLLEGE CAMPUSES AND

01:02:29.012 --> 01:02:32.582 region:rollup2
SEE ISSUE CAMPUSES YOU SEE IS

01:02:30.513 --> 01:02:33.850 region:rollup2
NOT A PART OF OF THE AGREEMENT

01:02:32.582 --> 01:02:34.985 region:rollup2
AND THEN FINALLY IT'S NOT SYSTEM

01:02:33.850 --> 01:02:36.720 region:rollup2
WIDE.

01:02:34.985 --> 01:02:37.654 region:rollup2
SO ARE A LOT OF CAN YOU COLLEGE

01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:39.189 region:rollup2
STUDENTS MIGHT THINK WELL I'M

01:02:37.654 --> 01:02:40.757 region:rollup2
NOT SURE I MIGHT WANT TO GO TO

01:02:39.189 --> 01:02:43.793 region:rollup2
YOU SEE I MIGHT WANT TO GO TO A

01:02:40.757 --> 01:02:45.095 region:rollup2
CSU. AND SO THAT DOESN'T REALLY

01:02:43.793 --> 01:02:46.863 region:rollup2
WORK IF YOU GET AN ASSOCIATE

01:02:45.095 --> 01:02:48.064 region:rollup2
DEGREE FOR TRANSFER THAT ONLY

01:02:46.863 --> 01:02:49.666 region:rollup2
GOES TO ONCE YES YOU MAYBE WANT

01:02:48.064 --> 01:02:51.434 region:rollup2
TO GO TO DIFFERENT CSU. AND THEN

01:02:49.666 --> 01:02:54.037 region:rollup2
FINALLY SO HAVING MORE SYSTEM

01:02:51.434 --> 01:02:55.672 region:rollup2
WIDE COHERENCE AND AGREEMENT I

01:02:54.037 --> 01:02:57.007 region:rollup2
THINK WOULD MAKE SENSE AND.

01:02:55.672 --> 01:02:58.541 region:rollup2
WE'RE GONNA HEAR FROM NDRC ABOUT

01:02:57.007 --> 01:02:59.476 region:rollup2
PRACTICES AND OTHER STATES SO I

01:02:58.541 --> 01:03:00.677 region:rollup2
DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS PART OF

01:02:59.476 --> 01:03:02.946 region:rollup2
THAT TESTIMONY BUT SOME OTHER

01:03:00.677 --> 01:03:04.981 region:rollup2
STATES HAVE MUCH MORE UNIFORM.

01:03:02.946 --> 01:03:06.950 region:rollup2
LOWER DIVISION REQUIREMENTS IN

01:03:04.981 --> 01:03:09.686 region:rollup2
THEIR COMMUNITY COLLEGES THAT

01:03:06.950 --> 01:03:10.987 region:rollup2
CLEARLY FEED TOO.

01:03:09.686 --> 01:03:13.390 region:rollup2
THEIR FOUR YEAR COLLEGES

01:03:10.987 --> 01:03:13.857 region:rollup2
AND AND AND UNIVERSITIES FINAL

01:03:13.390 --> 01:03:15.225 region:rollup2
NOTE THAT.

01:03:13.857 --> 01:03:16.559 region:rollup2
THEY TOO MANY COLLEGES ARE

01:03:15.225 --> 01:03:18.228 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTING THIS NEW GUIDED

01:03:16.559 --> 01:03:19.562 region:rollup2
PATHWAYS INITIATIVE WHICH IS

01:03:18.228 --> 01:03:20.597 region:rollup2
DESIGNED TO SOLVE SOME OF THE

01:03:19.562 --> 01:03:21.831 region:rollup2
PROBLEMS YOU MENTIONED WERE

01:03:20.597 --> 01:03:23.300 region:rollup2
STUDENTS TO START TAKING COURSES

01:03:21.831 --> 01:03:24.534 region:rollup2
AND THEN THEY.

01:03:23.300 --> 01:03:25.368 region:rollup2
MAYBE LATER SIGNED UP FOR THE

01:03:24.534 --> 01:03:26.703 region:rollup2
EIGHTY TWO YEAR THEY DON'T KNOW

01:03:25.368 --> 01:03:27.804 region:rollup2
ABOUT WHEN THEY FIRST GOT THERE

01:03:26.703 --> 01:03:28.838 region:rollup2
AND THE GUIDED PATHWAYS

01:03:27.804 --> 01:03:29.439 region:rollup2
INITIATIVE IS SUPPOSED TO GET

01:03:28.838 --> 01:03:30.307 region:rollup2
STUDENTS RIGHT WHEN THEY COME

01:03:29.439 --> 01:03:32.142 region:rollup2
IN.

01:03:30.307 --> 01:03:33.843 region:rollup2
AND HELP THEM HAVE A GUIDED

01:03:32.142 --> 01:03:36.212 region:rollup2
PATHWAYS MEANING YOU KNOW VERY

01:03:33.843 --> 01:03:38.281 region:rollup2
CLEAR UNDERSTANDING WHAT COURSES

01:03:36.212 --> 01:03:39.115 region:rollup2
THEY NEED TO TAKE WHEN. AND

01:03:38.281 --> 01:03:40.717 region:rollup2
MAKING SURE THOSE COURSES ARE

01:03:39.115 --> 01:03:42.218 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE. WHEN THOSE STUDENTS

01:03:40.717 --> 01:03:43.720 region:rollup2
WANT TO I NEED TO TAKE THEM SO

01:03:42.218 --> 01:03:44.921 region:rollup2
THAT THEY CAN COMPLETE ON A MORE

01:03:43.720 --> 01:03:46.323 region:rollup2
TIMELY BASIS AND ON THE

01:03:44.921 --> 01:03:48.792 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR

AGAIN HAVE FUNDED. ABOUT PROGRAM

01:03:48.792 --> 01:03:51.361 region:rollup2
JUST ONE NOTE I WOULD AGREE WITH

01:03:50.093 --> 01:03:52.395 region:rollup2
HAUNTED IT'S NOT SYSTEM WIDE AND

01:03:51.361 --> 01:03:54.197 region:rollup2
IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT IT'S

01:03:52.395 --> 01:03:56.700 region:rollup2
NOT SYSTEM WIDE. BOTH BY

01:03:54.197 --> 01:03:58.702 region:rollup2
INSTITUTION AND ALSO BY. DUBBED

01:03:56.700 --> 01:04:00.036 region:rollup2
BY MAJOR SO SOME INSTITUTIONS

MIGHT HAVE THE THIRTY THREE FOR

01:04:00.036 --> 01:04:01.838 region:rollup2
TRANSFERRING THE PSYCHOLOGY

01:04:00.603 --> 01:04:03.273 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT OTHERS WANT SO THAT

01:04:01.838 --> 01:04:05.175 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT IT'S NOT REALLY AN

EQUITABLE CHOICE FOR ALL

01:04:05.175 --> 01:04:08.211 region:rollup2
STUDENTS ACROSS.

01:04:07.143 --> 01:04:09.345 region:rollup2
SO LET ME ASK OUR CHAIRS REALLY

01:04:08.211 --> 01:04:11.815 region:rollup2
QUICKLY IS IS THERE ANY

01:04:09.345 --> 01:04:13.350 region:rollup2
POSSIBILITY OF AT LEAST GETTING

01:04:11.815 --> 01:04:15.518 region:rollup2
IT THE CURRENT INFORMATION WITH

01:04:13.350 --> 01:04:18.922 region:rollup2

SAY THEIR LAST SEMESTER UP

01:04:20.990 --> 01:04:23.660 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE STUDENTS WHO HAVE

01:04:21.958 --> 01:04:25.695 region:rollup2
ALREADY MADE THAT THE.

01:04:23.660 --> 01:04:27.497 region:rollup2
STEP TO GO TO A FOUR YEAR

01:04:25.695 --> 01:04:29.165 region:rollup2
THEY'VE ALREADY.

01:04:27.497 --> 01:04:30.633 region:rollup2
DONE THE APPLICATIONS WHETHER

01:04:29.165 --> 01:04:31.701 region:rollup2
IT'S YOU SEE YOUR CAL STATE BUT

01:04:30.633 --> 01:04:35.405 region:rollup2
THE STUDENTS ARE GOING TO GO TO

01:04:31.701 --> 01:04:37.006 region:rollup2
A COMMUNITY COLLEGE. MAY BE I.

01:04:35.405 --> 01:04:39.209 region:rollup2
TRYING TO MAKE THAT DECISION AND

01:04:37.006 --> 01:04:40.343 region:rollup2
IF THEY DO OVER THE SUMMER

01:04:39.209 --> 01:04:42.112 region:rollup2
DECIDE I'M GONNA GO TO JUST SAY

01:04:40.343 --> 01:04:43.279 region:rollup2
FULLERTON COLLEGE THEY STILL

01:04:42.112 --> 01:04:45.448 region:rollup2
MIGHT NOT KNOW ABOUT THE

01:04:43.279 --> 01:04:47.183 region:rollup2
TRANSFER DEGREE. OF OR ANY OF

01:04:45.448 --> 01:04:48.585 region:rollup2
THESE PATHWAYS AND NOWADAYS A

01:04:47.183 --> 01:04:50.220 region:rollup2
LOT OF STUDENTS DON'T GET TO THE

01:04:48.585 --> 01:04:52.122 region:rollup2
CAMPUS AND OTHER VERY FIRST DAY

01:04:50.220 --> 01:04:54.491 region:rollup2
OF CLASSES. BECAUSE THEY CAN DO

01:04:52.122 --> 01:04:55.759 region:rollup2
ALL OF THIS ONLINE SO IS THERE

01:04:54.491 --> 01:04:57.660 region:rollup2
ANY WAY FOR US TO HAVE.

01:04:55.759 --> 01:04:59.562 region:rollup2
TO DO TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET

01:04:57.660 --> 01:05:01.097 region:rollup2
THIS INFORMATION TO HIGH SCHOOL

01:04:59.562 --> 01:05:04.134 region:rollup2
SENIORS.

01:05:01.097 --> 01:05:06.536 region:rollup2
I HATE USING THE WORD AND ALL

01:05:04.134 --> 01:05:08.905 region:rollup2
OF THEM OR NOT BEEN MAKING IT

01:05:06.536 --> 01:05:11.374 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE BUT I REALLY DO THINK

01:05:08.905 --> 01:05:13.410 region:rollup2
IF WE HAD JUST A. VERY SIMPLE

01:05:11.374 --> 01:05:15.311 region:rollup2
ONE PAGE INFORMATION ABOUT

01:05:13.410 --> 01:05:17.280 region:rollup2
PATHWAYS IN THE TRANSFER BEFORE

01:05:15.311 --> 01:05:18.681 region:rollup2
THEY EVEN GET TO SIGNING UP

01:05:17.280 --> 01:05:20.316 region:rollup2
THEY'D AT LEAST KNOW THAT THAT'S

01:05:18.681 --> 01:05:21.751 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE.

01:05:20.316 --> 01:05:23.486 region:rollup2
NO I IF I COULD ANSWER.

01:05:21.751 --> 01:05:26.389 region:rollup2
I REMEMBER AS A HIGH SCHOOL

01:05:23.486 --> 01:05:26.689 region:rollup2
TEACHER OF WHEN THE CSU SYSTEM

01:05:26.389 --> 01:05:27.590 region:rollup2
WAS GIVING.

01:05:26.689 --> 01:05:29.759 region:rollup2
.

01:05:27.590 --> 01:05:32.128 region:rollup2
THE ASSESSMENT TEST.

01:05:29.759 --> 01:05:34.464 region:rollup2
TWO I SCHOOL SENIORS AS PART OF

01:05:32.128 --> 01:05:35.565 region:rollup2
THEIR OTHER TESTING.

01:05:34.464 --> 01:05:37.834 region:rollup2
AND AND THAT WAS WORK DENSE SO

01:05:35.565 --> 01:05:38.468 region:rollup2
THAT STUDENTS ALL SENIORS WHO

01:05:37.834 --> 01:05:40.737 region:rollup2
WERE TAKING THE.

01:05:38.468 --> 01:05:43.273 region:rollup2
I FORGET WHICH ASSESSMENT TESTS

01:05:40.737 --> 01:05:45.208 region:rollup2
WERE ABLE TO TAKE THE CSU

01:05:43.273 --> 01:05:46.543 region:rollup2
ASSESSMENT TESTS AS THE UP AS

01:05:45.208 --> 01:05:48.878 region:rollup2
PART OF THAT I THOUGHT THAT WAS

01:05:46.543 --> 01:05:50.780 region:rollup2
HELPFUL. AND SO CERTAINLY MISS

01:05:48.878 --> 01:05:52.916 region:rollup2
QUIRK SILVA I THINK THAT BOTH

01:05:50.780 --> 01:05:55.018 region:rollup2
CSU AND YOU SEE SHOULD BE ABLE

01:05:52.916 --> 01:05:56.886 region:rollup2
TO FIND A WAY. TO GET THAT

01:05:55.018 --> 01:05:58.455 region:rollup2
INFORMATION TO US. ALL HIGH

01:05:56.886 --> 01:06:00.089 region:rollup2
SCHOOL SENIORS BEFORE THEY

01:05:58.455 --> 01:06:02.358 region:rollup2
GRADUATE AND WE CAN WORK WITH

01:06:00.089 --> 01:06:04.227 region:rollup2
THEM ON THAT BECAUSE I THINK ANY

01:06:02.358 --> 01:06:06.596 region:rollup2
WE ALWAYS TALK BIG GLOBAL KIND

01:06:04.227 --> 01:06:08.765 region:rollup2
OF CHANGES BUT THIS CAN BE VERY

01:06:06.596 --> 01:06:10.333 region:rollup2
SIMPLE. WHERE AGAIN FOR THAT

01:06:08.765 --> 01:06:12.368 region:rollup2
GROUP OF STUDENTS WHO IS NOT

01:06:10.333 --> 01:06:13.870 region:rollup2
SURE WHAT THEY'RE DOING NEXT BUT

01:06:12.368 --> 01:06:15.839 region:rollup2
MIGHT CHOOSE THE COMMUNITY

01:06:13.870 --> 01:06:18.174 region:rollup2
COLLEGE CUT THAT THEY KNOW

01:06:15.839 --> 01:06:19.275 region:rollup2
BEFORE THEY EVEN LOOK AT THE

01:06:18.174 --> 01:06:20.910 region:rollup2
OFFERED? TO AN EIGHTIES ARE

01:06:19.275 --> 01:06:23.546 region:rollup2
THERE THAT THE COURSEWORK THAT

01:06:20.910 --> 01:06:25.348 region:rollup2
HEY IF I CHOOSE THIS TRANSFER

01:06:23.546 --> 01:06:26.716 region:rollup2
EVEN IF IT MAY NOT BE ALL OVER

01:06:25.348 --> 01:06:28.218 region:rollup2
AT LEAST THEY HAVE A PATHWAY

01:06:26.716 --> 01:06:30.153 region:rollup2
INTO THE FOUR YEAR. BECAUSE

01:06:28.218 --> 01:06:33.289 region:rollup2
UNFORTUNATELY WE'VE SEEN MANY

01:06:30.153 --> 01:06:34.224 region:rollup2
MANY STUDENTS I WOULD SAY MORE

01:06:33.289 --> 01:06:35.825 region:rollup2
MALES THAN FEMALES.

01:06:34.224 --> 01:06:37.927 region:rollup2
SPENDING FIVE AND SIX YEARS AT

01:06:35.825 --> 01:06:38.828 region:rollup2
THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE A LOT OF

01:06:37.927 --> 01:06:40.697 region:rollup2
IT IS THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY

01:06:38.828 --> 01:06:42.432 region:rollup2
WANT TO DO BUT A LOT OF IT IS

01:06:40.697 --> 01:06:43.566 region:rollup2
THEY START TAKING COURSEWORK.

01:06:42.432 --> 01:06:44.868 region:rollup2
THAN THEY REALIZE ALL I DON'T

01:06:43.566 --> 01:06:46.703 region:rollup2
REALLY NEED THAT THEY MIGHT SEE

01:06:44.868 --> 01:06:49.706 region:rollup2
A COUNSELOR COULD BE A YEAR INTO

01:06:46.703 --> 01:06:51.274 region:rollup2
THEIR EYES THEY DROP CLASSES AND

01:06:49.706 --> 01:06:53.676 region:rollup2
WE'RE JUST SEEING THAT THAT

01:06:51.274 --> 01:06:54.677 region:rollup2
STUDENT SUCCESS WHERE. THEY WANT

01:06:53.676 --> 01:06:56.145 region:rollup2
TO BE THERE MAY BECAUSE THEIR

01:06:54.677 --> 01:06:57.180 region:rollup2
PARENTS ARE TELLING THEM BUT

01:06:56.145 --> 01:06:59.115 region:rollup2
THEY JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY

01:06:57.180 --> 01:07:00.483 region:rollup2
WANT TO DO AND AND IT'S TAKING

01:06:59.115 --> 01:07:04.354 region:rollup2
THEM A LONG TIME IF THEY EVER

01:07:00.483 --> 01:07:05.054 region:rollup2
TRANSFER.

01:07:04.354 --> 01:07:08.791 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

01:07:05.054 --> 01:07:09.225 region:rollup2
BUT YOUR QUESTION YOU CAN.

01:07:08.791 --> 01:07:12.695 region:rollup2
I HAD TWO QUESTIONS.

01:07:09.225 --> 01:07:14.163 region:rollup2
.

01:07:12.695 --> 01:07:16.032 region:rollup2
RANDY I THINK YOU MENTIONED

01:07:14.163 --> 01:07:17.300 region:rollup2
YOU'VE MADE THE STATEMENT A A

01:07:16.032 --> 01:07:19.869 region:rollup2
LACK OF THE PUBLIC AGENDA FOR

01:07:17.300 --> 01:07:20.270 region:rollup2
HIGHER EDUCATION.

01:07:19.869 --> 01:07:21.304 region:rollup2
AND.

01:07:20.270 --> 01:07:22.672 region:rollup2
ONE OF THINGS THAT HAS STRUCK

01:07:21.304 --> 01:07:25.141 region:rollup2
ME MOST.

01:07:22.672 --> 01:07:27.110 region:rollup2
AS CHAIR OF HIGHER EDUCATION.

01:07:25.141 --> 01:07:29.279 region:rollup2
IN MY SEVERAL YEARS NOW SERVING

01:07:27.110 --> 01:07:30.880 region:rollup2
AS THE CHAIR UMPIRE EDUCATION IS

01:07:29.279 --> 01:07:32.982 region:rollup2
THAT WE DO NOT IN THE STATE OF

01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:36.386 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA ANYMORE. HAVE AN

01:07:32.982 --> 01:07:38.087 region:rollup2
OVERRIDING A UMBRELLA GROUP.

01:07:36.386 --> 01:07:41.024 region:rollup2
WHOSE MISSION I WOULD THINK

01:07:38.087 --> 01:07:42.225 region:rollup2
WOULD BE TO SET THAT AGENDA TO

01:07:41.024 --> 01:07:44.294 region:rollup2
SEE HOW THE DIFFERENT SEGMENTS

01:07:42.225 --> 01:07:46.262 region:rollup2
WORK TOGETHER.

01:07:44.294 --> 01:07:49.032 region:rollup2
SO I MAKE REFERENCE TO. WHEN WE

01:07:46.262 --> 01:07:50.833 region:rollup2
GOT RID OF SEPAK.

01:07:49.032 --> 01:07:51.968 region:rollup2
I'D THE POST CALIFORNIA PUT

01:07:50.833 --> 01:07:53.870 region:rollup2
SECONDARY EDUCATION COMMISSION

01:07:51.968 --> 01:07:54.604 region:rollup2
BEFORE WE GOT HERE YES AND THERE

01:07:53.870 --> 01:07:56.205 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT.

01:07:54.604 --> 01:07:57.373 region:rollup2
ATTEMPTS

01:07:56.205 --> 01:07:59.008 region:rollup2
BY THE LEGISLATURE BOTH IN THE

01:07:57.373 --> 01:08:00.577 region:rollup2
SENATE.

01:07:59.008 --> 01:08:04.647 region:rollup2
A TO TRY TO CREATE SUCH AN

01:08:00.577 --> 01:08:05.214 region:rollup2
ENTITY.

01:08:04.647 --> 01:08:08.151 region:rollup2
SO THAT STRIKES ME.

01:08:05.214 --> 01:08:10.186 region:rollup2
VERY MUCH THAT WE DO NOT HAVE

01:08:08.151 --> 01:08:11.854 region:rollup2
SUCH AN ENTITY ANYMORE AND SO

01:08:10.186 --> 01:08:13.222 region:rollup2
THEREFORE WHERE WITH THE AGENDA

01:08:11.854 --> 01:08:15.058 region:rollup2
COME FROM.

01:08:13.222 --> 01:08:16.092 region:rollup2
ALSO WITH THAT.

01:08:15.058 --> 01:08:17.894 region:rollup2
THE ABSENCE OF A STATE

01:08:16.092 --> 01:08:21.464 region:rollup2
COORDINATING BODY FOR HIGHER

01:08:17.894 --> 01:08:22.865 region:rollup2
EDUCATION. ALSO CONCERNS EXISTS

01:08:21.464 --> 01:08:24.734 region:rollup2
BUT THE STATE STILL HAS LIMITED

01:08:22.865 --> 01:08:26.536 region:rollup2
DATA CAPACITY.

01:08:24.734 --> 01:08:28.871 region:rollup2
WHICH COULD IMPACT OUR ABILITY

01:08:26.536 --> 01:08:30.673 region:rollup2
TO ASSESS DEGREE AND PAYMENT

01:08:28.871 --> 01:08:32.709 region:rollup2
INPUTS AND OUTPUTS

01:08:30.673 --> 01:08:34.110 region:rollup2
SO MY QUESTION. IS DO YOU HAVE

01:08:32.709 --> 01:08:36.179 region:rollup2
ANY SUGGESTIONS ON WAYS THAT

01:08:34.110 --> 01:08:36.646 region:rollup2
THIS CAN BE ADDRESSED.

01:08:36.179 --> 01:08:38.681 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

01:08:36.646 --> 01:08:40.383 region:rollup2
WE ARE VERY VERY STRONG

01:08:38.681 --> 01:08:43.052 region:rollup2
SUPPORTERS OF THE STATE.

01:08:40.383 --> 01:08:44.921 region:rollup2
HAVING A NEW BETTER VERSION OF

01:08:43.052 --> 01:08:46.589 region:rollup2
WHAT WAS THAT CALIFORNIA POST

01:08:44.921 --> 01:08:48.324 region:rollup2
SECONDARY EDUCATION COMMISSION.

01:08:46.589 --> 01:08:50.893 region:rollup2
THAT ENTITY REALLY.

01:08:48.324 --> 01:08:52.261 region:rollup2
IS A SIGNIFICANT INSOFAR AS IT

01:08:50.893 --> 01:08:53.997 region:rollup2
DOES HAVE THE ABILITY IF

01:08:52.261 --> 01:08:55.131 region:rollup2
CONSTRUCTED PROPERLY TO BE ABLE

01:08:53.997 --> 01:08:56.766 region:rollup2
TO SET A PUBLIC AGENDA FOR

01:08:55.131 --> 01:08:58.034 region:rollup2
HIGHER EDUCATION ONE THAT WOULD

01:08:56.766 --> 01:09:00.036 region:rollup2
BE INFORMED BY CERTAINLY.

01:08:58.034 --> 01:09:01.938 region:rollup2
THE VIEWS OF THE LEGISLATURE

01:09:00.036 --> 01:09:03.539 region:rollup2
AND THE ADMINISTRATION BUT ALSO

01:09:01.938 --> 01:09:04.941 region:rollup2
ONE THAT REALLY IS LOOKING OUT

01:09:03.539 --> 01:09:05.708 region:rollup2
ACROSS ALL OF OUR HIGHER

01:09:04.941 --> 01:09:08.177 region:rollup2
EDUCATION.

01:09:05.708 --> 01:09:09.445 region:rollup2
SEGMENTS TO UNDERSTAND HOW FAR

01:09:08.177 --> 01:09:11.381 region:rollup2
ARE WE GETTING ON THIS DEGREE

01:09:09.445 --> 01:09:12.515 region:rollup2
ATTAINMENT GAP AT WHAT RATE WHAT

01:09:11.381 --> 01:09:13.616 region:rollup2
KINDS OF POLICIES COULD BE IN

01:09:12.515 --> 01:09:14.884 region:rollup2
PLACE WHAT THE CAPACITY

01:09:13.616 --> 01:09:16.119 region:rollup2
CONSTRAINTS WE FACE HOW WOULD

01:09:14.884 --> 01:09:16.786 region:rollup2
YOU SOLVE FOR THOSE WHERE THE

01:09:16.119 --> 01:09:18.421 region:rollup2
CAPITAL NEEDS OF OUR

01:09:16.786 --> 01:09:21.357 region:rollup2
INSTITUTIONS. WE ACTUALLY THE

01:09:18.421 --> 01:09:22.992 region:rollup2
STATE HAS NO FUNCTION FOR

01:09:21.357 --> 01:09:24.127 region:rollup2
FIGURING OUT ANY OF THAT.

01:09:22.992 --> 01:09:25.061 region:rollup2
I KNOW MISTER BERMAN IS HAVING

01:09:24.127 --> 01:09:27.096 region:rollup2
HIS HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ON

01:09:25.061 --> 01:09:28.798 region:rollup2
THE MASTER PLAN AND THE MASTER

01:09:27.096 --> 01:09:30.266 region:rollup2
PLAN ORIGINALLY DESIGNED. THAT

01:09:28.798 --> 01:09:32.502 region:rollup2
THE SEAT SEE PACKETS THAT AS IT

01:09:30.266 --> 01:09:34.003 region:rollup2
EXISTED BUT OVER TIME SEE PACK.

01:09:32.502 --> 01:09:36.606 region:rollup2
A ROAD FOR A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT

01:09:34.003 --> 01:09:38.007 region:rollup2
REASONS AND NOW WE ACTUALLY FROM

01:09:36.606 --> 01:09:39.542 region:rollup2
THE HAVE INSTITUTIONS THAT I

01:09:38.007 --> 01:09:41.110 region:rollup2
THINK ARE DOING THEIR BEST BUT

01:09:39.542 --> 01:09:43.946 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT CLEAR HOW THAT ACTUALLY

01:09:41.110 --> 01:09:45.681 region:rollup2
RELATE TO THE STATES GOALS BOMB

01:09:43.946 --> 01:09:47.216 region:rollup2
RELATIVE TO THE INCREDIBLE LEVEL

01:09:45.681 --> 01:09:48.284 region:rollup2
OF INVESTMENT MAYBE NOT AS MUCH

01:09:47.216 --> 01:09:49.986 region:rollup2
AS WE MIGHT LIKE. TO SEE BUT

01:09:48.284 --> 01:09:51.454 region:rollup2
THEY SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT THAT

01:09:49.986 --> 01:09:53.823 region:rollup2
THE STATE MAKES AND HIGHER

01:09:51.454 --> 01:09:55.792 region:rollup2
EDUCATION AND ALSO RELATES TO

01:09:53.823 --> 01:09:57.226 region:rollup2
THE SIZE AND SCOPE AND SCALE AND

01:09:55.792 --> 01:09:58.194 region:rollup2
DIVERSITY OF OUR POPULATION AND

01:09:57.226 --> 01:10:00.129 region:rollup2
WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO BOTH

01:09:58.194 --> 01:10:01.364 region:rollup2
SUPPORT THOSE STUDENTS. AND MAKE

01:10:00.129 --> 01:10:02.899 region:rollup2
SURE THAT THERE'S A RELATIONSHIP

01:10:01.364 --> 01:10:04.867 region:rollup2
BETWEEN WHAT THOSE STUDENTS ARE

01:10:02.899 --> 01:10:06.102 region:rollup2
DOING AND OUR BROADER ECONOMY A

01:10:04.867 --> 01:10:07.336 region:rollup2
ONE THINKS HE PACKED INTO WAS TO

01:10:06.102 --> 01:10:08.871 region:rollup2
THINK ABOUT ECONOMIC CONCERNS AT

01:10:07.336 --> 01:10:10.440 region:rollup2
ALL IT WAS VERY JUST SINGULARLY

01:10:08.871 --> 01:10:12.241 region:rollup2
FOCUSED ON THE INSTITUTIONS. AND

01:10:10.440 --> 01:10:14.410 region:rollup2
IF THERE WERE ANOTHER STATEWIDE

01:10:12.241 --> 01:10:16.446 region:rollup2
COORDINATING ENTITY I WOULD

01:10:14.410 --> 01:10:17.847 region:rollup2
SUGGEST THAT BOTH THINK ABOUT

01:10:16.446 --> 01:10:19.882 region:rollup2
WHAT THE RELATIONSHIP IS A CROSS

01:10:17.847 --> 01:10:21.484 region:rollup2
BETWEEN INSTITUTIONS WHAT THOSE

01:10:19.882 --> 01:10:23.386 region:rollup2
NEEDS ARE FOR STUDENTS AND

01:10:21.484 --> 01:10:25.254 region:rollup2
INSTITUTIONS. AND WHAT THE NEEDS

01:10:23.386 --> 01:10:28.591 region:rollup2
OF THE ECONOMY ARE BECAUSE

01:10:25.254 --> 01:10:31.294 region:rollup2
THAT'S REALLY THE ROBUST.

01:10:28.591 --> 01:10:34.163 region:rollup2
KIND OF AGENCY OR OR FUNCTION

01:10:31.294 --> 01:10:35.431 region:rollup2
THAT WE NEED I THINK AS A STATE

01:10:34.163 --> 01:10:36.065 region:rollup2
SO.

01:10:35.431 --> 01:10:36.733 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA COMPETES IS DONE A

01:10:36.065 --> 01:10:37.400 region:rollup2
FAIR AMOUNT OF WORK ON WHAT IT

01:10:36.733 --> 01:10:38.101 region:rollup2
WOULD LOOK LIKE CALIFORNIA'S ONE

01:10:37.400 --> 01:10:39.001 region:rollup2
OF TWO STATES IN THE NATION THAT

01:10:38.101 --> 01:10:39.969 region:rollup2
DOES NOT HAVE SUCH A

01:10:39.001 --> 01:10:40.470 region:rollup2
COORDINATING ENTITY.

01:10:39.969 --> 01:10:41.604 region:rollup2
AND WE'D BE VERY MUCH

01:10:40.470 --> 01:10:42.271 region:rollup2
SUPPORTIVE OF TRYING TO HELP

01:10:41.604 --> 01:10:42.905 region:rollup2
FIGURE OUT WHAT WHAT WOULD WORK

01:10:42.271 --> 01:10:43.473 region:rollup2
BEST FOR CALIFORNIA GIVEN WHERE

01:10:42.905 --> 01:10:45.274 region:rollup2
WE ARE TODAY.

01:10:43.473 --> 01:10:46.542 region:rollup2
IT CERTAINLY SEEMS A THAT WE ARE

01:10:45.274 --> 01:10:48.144 region:rollup2
MISSING THAT HERE IN THE STATE

01:10:46.542 --> 01:10:49.679 region:rollup2
OF CALIFORNIA SO MY SECOND

01:10:48.144 --> 01:10:50.646 region:rollup2
QUESTION HAS TO DO WITH YOUR

01:10:49.679 --> 01:10:51.881 region:rollup2
STATEMENT. ABOUT THE INLAND

01:10:50.646 --> 01:10:54.117 region:rollup2
EMPIRE.

01:10:51.881 --> 01:10:56.719 region:rollup2
WHICH I REPRESENT.

01:10:54.117 --> 01:10:58.554 region:rollup2
AND AND LET YOU KNOW STUDENTS.

01:10:56.719 --> 01:10:59.422 region:rollup2
AND THEIR LACK OF ACHIEVEMENT.

01:10:58.554 --> 01:11:02.959 region:rollup2
AN AND I WILL NOTE THAT.

01:10:59.422 --> 01:11:03.826 region:rollup2
.

01:11:02.959 --> 01:11:06.429 region:rollup2
EVEN IN THAT STATEMENT UC

01:11:03.826 --> 01:11:08.831 region:rollup2
RIVERSIDE WHICH IN MY DISTRICT.

01:11:06.429 --> 01:11:11.734 region:rollup2
PROBABLY HAS THE VERY HIGHEST

01:11:08.831 --> 01:11:13.736 region:rollup2
A DIVERSITY OF ANY OF THE UC'S

01:11:11.734 --> 01:11:15.538 region:rollup2
AND PROBABLY GRADUATES NOTE BUT

01:11:13.736 --> 01:11:16.873 region:rollup2
A LARGE NUMBER OF BECAUSE I'VE

01:11:15.538 --> 01:11:18.341 region:rollup2
BEEN A GRADUATION. OF LATINO

01:11:16.873 --> 01:11:20.676 region:rollup2
STUDENTS

01:11:18.341 --> 01:11:21.210 region:rollup2
A EVERY YEAR AND DOES A GREAT

01:11:20.676 --> 01:11:21.778 region:rollup2
JOB WITH AFRICAN AMERICAN

01:11:21.210 --> 01:11:24.013 region:rollup2
STUDENTS.

01:11:21.778 --> 01:11:26.449 region:rollup2
AS WELL.

01:11:24.013 --> 01:11:28.251 region:rollup2
SO MY MY MY QUESTION IS HOW

01:11:26.449 --> 01:11:29.352 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT ARE LATINO STUDENTS TO

01:11:28.251 --> 01:11:30.586 region:rollup2
CLOSING THE.

01:11:29.352 --> 01:11:33.256 region:rollup2
ACHIEVEMENT GAP.

01:11:30.586 --> 01:11:35.858 region:rollup2
AND.

01:11:33.256 --> 01:11:36.592 region:rollup2
WHAT ELSE CAN THE STATE DO?

01:11:35.858 --> 01:11:38.361 region:rollup2
I THOUGHT YOU KNOW LATINO

01:11:36.592 --> 01:11:39.495 region:rollup2
STUDENTS ARE CENTRAL TO CLOSING

01:11:38.361 --> 01:11:40.763 region:rollup2
THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP WHEN YOU

01:11:39.495 --> 01:11:42.064 region:rollup2
LOOK AND WE HAVE A DEMOGRAPHER

01:11:40.763 --> 01:11:43.466 region:rollup2
HERE WHO CAN TALK WITH US ABOUT

01:11:42.064 --> 01:11:44.267 region:rollup2
THAT THE CHANGING CALIFORNIA

01:11:43.466 --> 01:11:46.469 region:rollup2
POPULATION BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT

01:11:44.267 --> 01:11:48.237 region:rollup2
THE COMPATIBILITY OF STUDENTS IN

01:11:46.469 --> 01:11:49.472 region:rollup2
THE STATE. INCREASINGLY.

01:11:48.237 --> 01:11:50.406 region:rollup2
THE LARGEST SHARE AM.

01:11:49.472 --> 01:11:51.908 region:rollup2
AND MANY OF OUR INSTITUTIONS

01:11:50.406 --> 01:11:54.043 region:rollup2
ARE LATINO STUDENTS AND SO WE

01:11:51.908 --> 01:11:56.145 region:rollup2
REALLY CAN'T GET TO.

01:11:54.043 --> 01:11:57.747 region:rollup2
TO THIS THIS GOAL WITHOUT

01:11:56.145 --> 01:11:59.048 region:rollup2
TAKING VERY SERIOUSLY THE GAPS

01:11:57.747 --> 01:12:00.383 region:rollup2
THAT WE IN THE DISPARITIES THAT

01:11:59.048 --> 01:12:01.784 region:rollup2
WE FACE BY RACE.

01:12:00.383 --> 01:12:03.386 region:rollup2
LATINO STUDENTS AND AFRICAN

01:12:01.784 --> 01:12:05.388 region:rollup2
AMERICAN STUDENTS IN PARTICULAR

01:12:03.386 --> 01:12:06.622 region:rollup2
ARE AT RISK OF NOT GRADUATING

01:12:05.388 --> 01:12:08.324 region:rollup2
WHAT WE SEE IS A LOT OF AFRICAN

01:12:06.622 --> 01:12:09.825 region:rollup2
AMERICAN STUDENTS WHO WENT UP.

01:12:08.324 --> 01:12:10.860 region:rollup2
PARTICULARLY MEN WHO END UP FOR

01:12:09.825 --> 01:12:12.862 region:rollup2
OUR ATTENDING PRIVATE FOR PROFIT

01:12:10.860 --> 01:12:14.163 region:rollup2
INSTITUTIONS BECAUSE THEY CAN'T

01:12:12.862 --> 01:12:15.698 region:rollup2
MAKE THEIR WAY THROUGH OUR

01:12:14.163 --> 01:12:17.266 region:rollup2
PUBLIC INSTITUTIONAL SYSTEMS.

01:12:15.698 --> 01:12:19.702 region:rollup2
BUMP INTO WE REALLY NEED TO JUST

01:12:17.266 --> 01:12:21.370 region:rollup2
HAVE A MUCH CLEANER FOCUS ON

01:12:19.702 --> 01:12:23.139 region:rollup2
WHAT KINDS OF STRATEGIES WE NEED

01:12:21.370 --> 01:12:24.006 region:rollup2
TED TO MOVE THROUGH THAT I KNOW

01:12:23.139 --> 01:12:25.208 region:rollup2
OUR COLLEAGUES FROM DRC YOU'RE

01:12:24.006 --> 01:12:26.275 region:rollup2
GONNA TALK ABOUT A PROJECT THAT

01:12:25.208 --> 01:12:28.144 region:rollup2
THEY ARE LOOKING UP IN THE STATE

01:12:26.275 --> 01:12:29.612 region:rollup2
OF CALIFORNIA. LATINO WHICH IS

01:12:28.144 --> 01:12:30.846 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT HOW TO YOU AND MOVE

01:12:29.612 --> 01:12:32.348 region:rollup2
THE NEEDLE IN PARTICULAR ON

01:12:30.846 --> 01:12:34.684 region:rollup2
LATINO STUDENTS.

01:12:32.348 --> 01:12:36.786 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK THAT IS AN

01:12:34.684 --> 01:12:37.653 region:rollup2
ESSENTIAL PART OF.

01:12:36.786 --> 01:12:38.287 region:rollup2
OF OF THE STORY IN ABOUT TWO

01:12:37.653 --> 01:12:40.723 region:rollup2
WEEKS WE'RE GONNA BE COMING OUT

01:12:38.287 --> 01:12:41.691 region:rollup2
WITH A SET OF FACT SHEETS OF THE

01:12:40.723 --> 01:12:43.526 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA COMPETES HAS

01:12:41.691 --> 01:12:45.027 region:rollup2
DEVELOPED ON RACE IN THE ECONOMY

01:12:43.526 --> 01:12:46.596 region:rollup2
THAT'LL SHOW SOME OF THE DID

01:12:45.027 --> 01:12:47.763 region:rollup2
THESE DISPARITIES BY RACE. AND

01:12:46.596 --> 01:12:48.731 region:rollup2
SUGGEST WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO

01:12:47.763 --> 01:12:50.633 region:rollup2
REALLY MOVE STUDENTS BOTH

01:12:48.731 --> 01:12:51.167 region:rollup2
THROUGH THE PIPELINE AS WELL AS

01:12:50.633 --> 01:12:52.902 region:rollup2
ENSURE THAT THEY'RE IN THE

01:12:51.167 --> 01:12:54.904 region:rollup2
ECONOMY.

01:12:52.902 --> 01:12:57.506 region:rollup2
AND LASTLY A NOT A QUESTION BUT

01:12:54.904 --> 01:12:59.575 region:rollup2
A A STATEMENT AND THAT IS THAT

01:12:57.506 --> 01:13:01.244 region:rollup2
IT IS ALSO STRIKING TO ME. THAT

01:12:59.575 --> 01:13:03.479 region:rollup2
AT THE TIME THAT LATINO STUDENTS

01:13:01.244 --> 01:13:05.648 region:rollup2
MAKE SUCH A HIGH. A PERCENTAGE

01:13:03.479 --> 01:13:07.883 region:rollup2
OF THE POPULATION AND MAKE

01:13:05.648 --> 01:13:10.953 region:rollup2
CREATE SUCH A HIGH PERCENTAGE.

01:13:07.883 --> 01:13:12.121 region:rollup2
OF THE COLLEGE STUDENTS IS THE

01:13:10.953 --> 01:13:15.591 region:rollup2
EXACT TIME OR THE STATE OF

01:13:12.121 --> 01:13:17.493 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA DECIDES TO NOT FUND

01:13:15.591 --> 01:13:18.160 region:rollup2
HIGHER EDUCATION AT THE RATES

01:13:17.493 --> 01:13:20.830 region:rollup2
THAT IT HAS IN THE PAST.

01:13:18.160 --> 01:13:21.364 region:rollup2
THANK.

01:13:20.830 --> 01:13:23.532 region:rollup2
THANK YOU AND I WILL HAVE

01:13:21.364 --> 01:13:25.001 region:rollup2
ASSEMBLY MEMBERS LEVINE LIMON

01:13:23.532 --> 01:13:26.936 region:rollup2
BUT I WAS GOING TO FOLLOW UP ON

01:13:25.001 --> 01:13:28.537 region:rollup2
MISTER MEDINA'S QUESTION.

01:13:26.936 --> 01:13:29.639 region:rollup2
THE IT BUT JUST FIRST WITH THE

01:13:28.537 --> 01:13:31.474 region:rollup2
COMMENTS OF THE WHOLE NOTION AS

01:13:29.639 --> 01:13:33.042 region:rollup2
FAR AS THAT THAT MASTER PLAN IN

01:13:31.474 --> 01:13:34.543 region:rollup2
THE TWELVE AND THIRTY THREE FOR

01:13:33.042 --> 01:13:36.045 region:rollup2
UC AND CSU RESPECTFULLY I

01:13:34.543 --> 01:13:37.947 region:rollup2
APPRECIATE THE COMMENT AND. I

01:13:36.045 --> 01:13:39.348 region:rollup2
KNOW THAT MISTER BERMAN'S.

01:13:37.947 --> 01:13:41.183 region:rollup2
SUBCOMMITTEE I MEAN SELECT

01:13:39.348 --> 01:13:41.918 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE HAS BEEN TAKING A LOOK

01:13:41.183 --> 01:13:43.119 region:rollup2
AT THIS TOO BUT I I THINK WE

01:13:41.918 --> 01:13:45.321 region:rollup2
OUGHT TO ASK OURSELVES THE

01:13:43.119 --> 01:13:47.089 region:rollup2
QUESTION IS IS IS THAT THE MAGIC

01:13:45.321 --> 01:13:48.691 region:rollup2
NUMBER. SIXTY YEARS AGO YOU

01:13:47.089 --> 01:13:50.259 region:rollup2
DIDN'T NEED A DEGREE TO GET A

01:13:48.691 --> 01:13:51.527 region:rollup2
GOOD PAYING JOB IN A BE IN THE

01:13:50.259 --> 01:13:53.195 region:rollup2
MIDDLE CLASS.

01:13:51.527 --> 01:13:55.298 region:rollup2
THAT WAS NEVER CODIFIED THE AD

01:13:53.195 --> 01:13:56.999 region:rollup2
CODE IT WAS THAT A PLAN AND SO

01:13:55.298 --> 01:13:58.567 region:rollup2
THAT WAS THEN THIS IS NOW IN SO

01:13:56.999 --> 01:14:00.303 region:rollup2
I REALLY THINK WE OUGHT TO.

01:13:58.567 --> 01:14:02.138 region:rollup2
THINK ABOUT WHETHER THROUGH THE

01:14:00.303 --> 01:14:03.539 region:rollup2
OTHER A BUDGET PROSELYTIZATION

01:14:02.138 --> 01:14:05.508 region:rollup2
AND WHAT HAVE YOU. AND

01:14:03.539 --> 01:14:07.209 region:rollup2
STATUTORILY CHANGE THAT AND PUT

01:14:05.508 --> 01:14:08.611 region:rollup2
IT AND PUT IT IN AND ARE

01:14:07.209 --> 01:14:10.813 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

01:14:08.611 --> 01:14:12.315 region:rollup2
THE EDUCATION CODE AS FAR AS I

01:14:10.813 --> 01:14:13.649 region:rollup2
HIGHER NUMBERS AND GOALS BECAUSE

01:14:12.315 --> 01:14:15.551 region:rollup2
REALLY REFLECT THE NEEDS OF

01:14:13.649 --> 01:14:17.086 region:rollup2
TODAY AND TOMORROW BY DIDN'T ASK

01:14:15.551 --> 01:14:18.754 region:rollup2
ON THE ON THE IN. THE NUMBERS

01:14:17.086 --> 01:14:20.456 region:rollup2
AND EQUITY ISSUES. YOU KNOW IT'S

01:14:18.754 --> 01:14:21.457 region:rollup2
EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING FOR A LOT

01:14:20.456 --> 01:14:23.025 region:rollup2
OF US WE LOOK AT THE

01:14:21.457 --> 01:14:24.760 region:rollup2
DEMOGRAPHICS OF CALIFORNIA HIGH

01:14:23.025 --> 01:14:26.362 region:rollup2
SCHOOL STUDENTS IN OUR COLLEGES

01:14:24.760 --> 01:14:28.064 region:rollup2
DON'T REFLECT IN THE

01:14:26.362 --> 01:14:31.300 region:rollup2
COMMUNICABLE JUST PRETTY GOOD

01:14:28.064 --> 01:14:32.868 region:rollup2
CSU. UP PRETTY GOOD TO YOU SEE

01:14:31.300 --> 01:14:34.170 region:rollup2
UP NOT SELF.

01:14:32.868 --> 01:14:36.405 region:rollup2
SO IF IF WE DID HAVE FOR

01:14:34.170 --> 01:14:38.240 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE THAT THE UC LOOK AT THEM

01:14:36.405 --> 01:14:39.742 region:rollup2
GO FROM THAT THAT TWELVE AND A

01:14:38.240 --> 01:14:41.243 region:rollup2
HALF TO THE TO THE SEVENTEEN.

01:14:39.742 --> 01:14:43.579 region:rollup2
COULD WE EXPECT THAT WE WOULD

01:14:41.243 --> 01:14:45.181 region:rollup2
HAVE A DRAMATIC IMPACTS IN

01:14:43.579 --> 01:14:48.017 region:rollup2
DIVERSIFYING THAT THE UC

01:14:45.181 --> 01:14:49.719 region:rollup2
POPULATION LIKE WE SEE AT CSU.

01:14:48.017 --> 01:14:51.454 region:rollup2
SO IT IS THE CASE THAT IF YOU

01:14:49.719 --> 01:14:53.456 region:rollup2
SEE HOLD AND MORE HIGH SCHOOL

01:14:51.454 --> 01:14:55.691 region:rollup2
GRADUATES IT WOULD. HAVE A MORE

01:14:53.456 --> 01:14:56.625 region:rollup2
DIVERSE SET OF STUDENTS

01:14:55.691 --> 01:14:58.260 region:rollup2
ATTENDING SO IT WOULD GO PART

01:14:56.625 --> 01:15:00.196 region:rollup2
WAY.

01:14:58.260 --> 01:15:02.064 region:rollup2
TOWARDS CLOSING THOSE.

01:15:00.196 --> 01:15:03.566 region:rollup2
DIFFERENCES.

01:15:02.064 --> 01:15:04.633 region:rollup2
ABOUT AT THE END OF THE DAY WE

01:15:03.566 --> 01:15:06.669 region:rollup2
NEED BETTER HIGH SCHOOL

01:15:04.633 --> 01:15:08.871 region:rollup2
PREPARATION AS WELL SO THAT WE

01:15:06.669 --> 01:15:11.007 region:rollup2
HAVE. MORE LATINOS MORE AFRICAN

01:15:08.871 --> 01:15:13.209 region:rollup2
AMERICANS SPEND MORE LOW INCOME

01:15:11.007 --> 01:15:15.711 region:rollup2
STUDENTS. WHO ARE? ELIGIBLE FOR

01:15:13.209 --> 01:15:17.012 region:rollup2
YOU SEE. EVEN AT THAT THE TOP

01:15:15.711 --> 01:15:18.647 region:rollup2
SEVENTEEN AND A HALF PERCENT OF

01:15:17.012 --> 01:15:19.215 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHAT WE WANT TO. AND

01:15:18.647 --> 01:15:20.349 region:rollup2
AGAIN THERE'S BEEN PROGRESS

01:15:19.215 --> 01:15:21.650 region:rollup2
MADE.

01:15:20.349 --> 01:15:23.252 region:rollup2
IF YOU LOOK AT A THREE G.

01:15:21.650 --> 01:15:24.653 region:rollup2
COMPLACENT BUT IT'S STILL NOT

01:15:23.252 --> 01:15:27.823 region:rollup2
SUFFICIENT AND THE GAPS REMAIN

01:15:24.653 --> 01:15:30.526 region:rollup2
QUITE QUITE LARGE.

01:15:27.823 --> 01:15:31.660 region:rollup2
THANK YOU SO MEMBER LIVING.

QUICKLY AND I REGRET THAT I NEED

01:15:36.098 --> 01:15:39.835 region:rollup2
TO DEPART. THAT I WON A COUPLE

01:15:37.700 --> 01:15:41.203 region:rollup2
COMMENTS IN OUR QUEST BUT BOTH

01:15:39.835 --> 01:15:42.605 region:rollup2
OF YOU BUT ALSO OF THE SYSTEMS

01:15:41.203 --> 01:15:44.540 region:rollup2
ARE THAT ARE GOING TO BE

01:15:42.605 --> 01:15:47.877 region:rollup2
PROVIDING TESTIMONY LATER.

01:15:44.540 --> 01:15:49.311 region:rollup2
FIRST OF ALL. OF MISTER JOHNSON

01:15:47.877 --> 01:15:50.880 region:rollup2
YOU WOULD TALK YOU MENTIONED.

01:15:49.311 --> 01:15:52.448 region:rollup2
THE CS USE CHANGE IN THE

01:15:50.880 --> 01:15:53.916 region:rollup2
REMEDIATION POLICY WHICH I

01:15:52.448 --> 01:15:56.285 region:rollup2
APPLIED OUT WHICH IS A HUGE

01:15:53.916 --> 01:15:58.354 region:rollup2
BARRIER FOR STUDENTS JUST TO

01:15:56.285 --> 01:16:00.122 region:rollup2
TAKE THEIR GENERAL EDUCATION

01:15:58.354 --> 01:16:02.324 region:rollup2
MATHEMATICS REQUIREMENT SO

01:16:00.122 --> 01:16:02.792 region:rollup2
STUDENTS STILL NEED TO TAKE. A

01:16:02.324 --> 01:16:04.994 region:rollup2
G. E. IN MATHEMATICS.

01:16:02.792 --> 01:16:07.663 region:rollup2
.

01:16:04.994 --> 01:16:08.731 region:rollup2
AT THE CSU AND IT THIS

01:16:07.663 --> 01:16:10.1000 region:rollup2
A HUGE BARRIER TO JUST EARNING

01:16:08.731 --> 01:16:12.301 region:rollup2
UNITS.

01:16:10.1000 --> 01:16:13.803 region:rollup2
IS GONE BECAUSE ATTORNEY

01:16:12.301 --> 01:16:15.905 region:rollup2
REMEDIAL CLASSES EARNED ZERO

01:16:13.803 --> 01:16:16.806 region:rollup2
UNITS THAT THAT'S INSIDE PAY FOR

01:16:15.905 --> 01:16:18.674 region:rollup2
THAT DID NOT GET THEM TO

01:16:16.806 --> 01:16:19.241 region:rollup2
GRADUATION SO THAT IS A GREAT

01:16:18.674 --> 01:16:20.609 region:rollup2
MOVE BY THE CALIFORNIA STATE

01:16:19.241 --> 01:16:20.810 region:rollup2
UNIVERSITY.

01:16:20.609 --> 01:16:23.079 region:rollup2
THE.

01:16:20.810 --> 01:16:24.613 region:rollup2
AT MISTER CHAIR OF MR MEDINA

01:16:23.079 --> 01:16:27.450 region:rollup2
HAD MENTIONED.

01:16:24.613 --> 01:16:27.616 region:rollup2
THE DEMISE AND END OF SEPAK

01:16:27.450 --> 01:16:29.518 region:rollup2
AND.

01:16:27.616 --> 01:16:31.120 region:rollup2
.

01:16:29.518 --> 01:16:32.788 region:rollup2
A LITTLE BIT OF A QUESTION OF

01:16:31.120 --> 01:16:34.290 region:rollup2
WHO SETS THE AGENDA NOW FOR

01:16:32.788 --> 01:16:35.991 region:rollup2
HIGHER EDUCATION WHICH I THINK

01:16:34.290 --> 01:16:37.526 region:rollup2
WE WILL CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE

01:16:35.991 --> 01:16:38.594 region:rollup2
WITH HOW WE COORDINATE THAT

01:16:37.526 --> 01:16:40.296 region:rollup2
BEYOND THE HEADS OF THE THREE

01:16:38.594 --> 01:16:42.231 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS.

01:16:40.296 --> 01:16:43.999 region:rollup2
BUT TAHT BUT IT IN IN THAT THAT

01:16:42.231 --> 01:16:45.601 region:rollup2
ABSENCE IN THE VOID.

01:16:43.999 --> 01:16:47.670 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATURE HAS STEPPED UP

01:16:45.601 --> 01:16:48.737 region:rollup2
SOMEWHAT. AND DIE IN IN

01:16:47.670 --> 01:16:51.040 region:rollup2

US LEARN FROM A LAW THAT I

01:16:54.310 --> 01:16:59.415 region:rollup2
AUTHORED LAST YEAR. ON HAVING A

01:16:57.746 --> 01:17:01.817 region:rollup2
TO POINT THE DOCTOR JOSI MADE.

THAT ARE NECESSARY FOR THE

01:17:05.955 --> 01:17:08.491 region:rollup2
REGION'S

01:17:07.256 --> 01:17:10.059 region:rollup2
AFTER THE EMPLOYMENT THAT'S

01:17:08.491 --> 01:17:11.927 region:rollup2
NECESSARY AND SO I AUTHORED AB

01:17:10.059 --> 01:17:13.596 region:rollup2
NINE FIFTY SEVEN. THE COMMUNITY

01:17:11.927 --> 01:17:15.798 region:rollup2
COLLEGES VERY.

UP QUICKLY.

01:17:15.798 --> 01:17:19.268 region:rollup2
CONNECTED WITH AN OBAMA ERA

01:17:17.366 --> 01:17:21.303 region:rollup2
PROGRAM TO BE TIED IN WITH

01:17:19.268 --> 01:17:23.072 region:rollup2
WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PORTS AND

IT BUT. BUT I THINK THAT IN A

01:17:32.314 --> 01:17:35.718 region:rollup2
FEW YEARS WE MAY HAVE A SENSE

01:17:33.949 --> 01:17:37.186 region:rollup2
BOTH OF HOW THE SYSTEMS HAVE

01:17:35.718 --> 01:17:38.687 region:rollup2
CHANGED THEIR COURSE OFFERINGS

01:17:37.186 --> 01:17:40.856 region:rollup2
IN THEIR PROGRAM OFFERINGS AND

01:17:46.328 --> 01:17:49.932 region:rollup2
SKILL DESIRE.

01:17:47.530 --> 01:17:51.133 region:rollup2
IS MATCHED AS WELL AS IF THOSE.

01:17:49.932 --> 01:17:52.668 region:rollup2
EVENTUALLY ENDED UP INTO JOBS IN

01:17:51.133 --> 01:17:54.236 region:rollup2
THOSE REGIONS

01:17:52.668 --> 01:17:56.338 region:rollup2
WHICH IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT

01:17:54.236 --> 01:17:57.273 region:rollup2
NOT JUST FOR ECONOMIC SUCCESS OF

01:17:56.338 --> 01:17:59.241 region:rollup2
THE INDIVIDUAL STUDENTS BUT THE

01:17:57.273 --> 01:18:01.777 region:rollup2
REGION'S THEMSELVES.

01:17:59.241 --> 01:18:03.679 region:rollup2
AND DIED AND SO. IF I HAD PUT IN

01:18:01.777 --> 01:18:05.047 region:rollup2
TO THE BILL THAT WE NEED TO

01:18:03.679 --> 01:18:06.549 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY STUDY WEATHER AT ALL

01:18:05.047 --> 01:18:07.883 region:rollup2
CURRENT WOULD INTO EXPENSIVE AND

01:18:06.549 --> 01:18:09.818 region:rollup2
THEN WE PROBABLY WENT TO BELA.

01:18:07.883 --> 01:18:10.953 region:rollup2
AFFORD TO PAY FOR THAT BILL BUT

01:18:09.818 --> 01:18:11.954 region:rollup2
WE WILL NEED THE HELP FROM THE

01:18:10.953 --> 01:18:13.589 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS EVERYONE'S LAUGHING

01:18:11.954 --> 01:18:15.691 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY KNOW HOW THAT GOES.

01:18:13.589 --> 01:18:17.159 region:rollup2
CAN AND DOES SO THE HELP FROM

01:18:15.691 --> 01:18:18.994 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS AS WELL AS HELP FROM

01:18:17.159 --> 01:18:21.730 region:rollup2
OBSERVERS LIKE YOU WHO CARE.

01:18:18.994 --> 01:18:22.731 region:rollup2
TO SEE IN IN THE GOT COMING

01:18:21.730 --> 01:18:24.300 region:rollup2
YEARS IF THAT IN FACT

01:18:22.731 --> 01:18:25.868 region:rollup2
KURT I WOULD BE GREATLY.

01:18:24.300 --> 01:18:27.036 region:rollup2
APPRECIATIVE OF THAT I THINK WE

01:18:25.868 --> 01:18:28.103 region:rollup2
ALL WOULD WOULD BENEFIT FROM

01:18:27.036 --> 01:18:31.106 region:rollup2
THAT KNOWLEDGE.

01:18:28.103 --> 01:18:33.342 region:rollup2
AND LASTLY ANOTHER POINT THAT.

01:18:31.106 --> 01:18:35.110 region:rollup2
THAT MR MEDINA REALLY APTLY MADE

01:18:33.342 --> 01:18:35.778 region:rollup2
WHICH IS.

01:18:35.110 --> 01:18:37.880 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:18:35.778 --> 01:18:39.848 region:rollup2
THE RISE IN THE LATINO

01:18:37.880 --> 01:18:41.650 region:rollup2
POPULATION IS COMING AT A TIME

01:18:39.848 --> 01:18:43.852 region:rollup2
WHEN SUPPORT FOR PUBLIC

01:18:41.650 --> 01:18:45.387 region:rollup2
EDUCATION. IS SLOWING

01:18:43.852 --> 01:18:48.257 region:rollup2
DRAMATICALLY SO IT'S IT'S NOT

01:18:45.387 --> 01:18:49.858 region:rollup2
GOING DOWN BUT IT'S GROWING AS A

01:18:48.257 --> 01:18:50.759 region:rollup2
SHARE OF THE STATE BUDGET. IT'S

01:18:49.858 --> 01:18:52.261 region:rollup2
LESS THAN IT HAD BEEN IN THE

01:18:50.759 --> 01:18:52.962 region:rollup2
PAST

01:18:52.261 --> 01:18:53.929 region:rollup2
AND.

01:18:52.962 --> 01:18:56.198 region:rollup2
IN IS DECLINING.

01:18:53.929 --> 01:18:57.433 region:rollup2
AND.

01:18:56.198 --> 01:18:58.867 region:rollup2
THIS IS ONE OF THOSE POINTS THAT

01:18:57.433 --> 01:19:00.102 region:rollup2
WE HAVE TO JUST KIND OF.

01:18:58.867 --> 01:19:02.738 region:rollup2
TAKE A MEASURE OF THIS MOMENT

01:19:00.102 --> 01:19:04.974 region:rollup2
AND SAY HOW DO WE PREPARE

01:19:02.738 --> 01:19:07.243 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA FOR A BETTER FUTURE

01:19:04.974 --> 01:19:09.378 region:rollup2
AND IT'S GOING TO BE GROWING

01:19:07.243 --> 01:19:11.580 region:rollup2
PUBLIC INVESTMENT NOT SLOWING

01:19:09.378 --> 01:19:12.448 region:rollup2
DOWN PUBLIC INVESTMENT. AND SO I

01:19:11.580 --> 01:19:13.582 region:rollup2
THINK THAT WE NEED TO HAVE A

01:19:12.448 --> 01:19:15.351 region:rollup2
REALLY.

01:19:13.582 --> 01:19:18.487 region:rollup2
STRONG COMMITMENT JUST TO THE

01:19:15.351 --> 01:19:20.756 region:rollup2
STATE IN ITSELF TO RECOMMIT THAT

01:19:18.487 --> 01:19:22.658 region:rollup2
TODD BACK GROWTH TO A LEVEL THAT

01:19:20.756 --> 01:19:24.994 region:rollup2
MEETS THE STATE'S NEEDS RATHER

01:19:22.658 --> 01:19:27.630 region:rollup2
THAN ON. IN A SENSE.

01:19:24.994 --> 01:19:30.032 region:rollup2
I AS COSTS GO UP THAT WE SHRINK

01:19:27.630 --> 01:19:32.501 region:rollup2
AWAY FROM COVERING THOSE COSTS

01:19:30.032 --> 01:19:34.270 region:rollup2
AND DIED OUT ALLOW FOR.

01:19:32.501 --> 01:19:35.304 region:rollup2
DOT FUTURE TO ALSO BE

01:19:34.270 --> 01:19:38.007 region:rollup2
DIMINISHED SO THANK YOU BOTH

01:19:35.304 --> 01:19:39.742 region:rollup2
VERY MUCH.

01:19:38.007 --> 01:19:41.877 region:rollup2
THANK YOU MS LOW.

01:19:39.742 --> 01:19:42.878 region:rollup2

AND SOMETHING THAT US SUMMER

01:19:42.878 --> 01:19:46.715 region:rollup2
CREEK SILVA HAD MENTIONED AND I

01:19:45.047 --> 01:19:48.584 region:rollup2
KNOW THAT AT THE SCHOOL DISTRICT

01:19:46.715 --> 01:19:50.052 region:rollup2
THAT I WORKED WITH ACTUALLY HAD

01:19:48.584 --> 01:19:51.053 region:rollup2
A EVERY HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT WHO

01:19:50.052 --> 01:19:52.421 region:rollup2
KNEW THAT THEY WERE GOING TO

01:19:51.053 --> 01:19:54.423 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY COLLEGE.

01:19:52.421 --> 01:19:55.791 region:rollup2
AND ASSESSMENT ON THE HIGH

01:19:54.423 --> 01:19:57.092 region:rollup2
SCHOOL CAMPUSAT THE STUDENT

01:19:55.791 --> 01:19:58.861 region:rollup2
WOULDN'T HAVE TO GO TO THE

01:19:57.092 --> 01:20:00.863 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY COLLEGE BUT THEY ALSO

01:19:58.861 --> 01:20:02.231 region:rollup2
HAD. KIND OF A DAY WHERE YOU

01:20:00.863 --> 01:20:03.499 region:rollup2
HAVE THE ADMISSIONS DEPARTMENT

01:20:02.231 --> 01:20:04.767 region:rollup2

HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS.

01:20:08.937 --> 01:20:11.874 region:rollup2
SO I THINK THAT PERHAPS.

01:20:10.973 --> 01:20:14.677 region:rollup2
IF WE REFRAME.

01:20:11.874 --> 01:20:16.712 region:rollup2
HER QUESTION ABOUT YOU KNOW.

01:20:14.677 --> 01:20:18.314 region:rollup2

COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE DOING.

01:20:18.314 --> 01:20:21.884 region:rollup2
AND AND WHAT KIND OF OUTREACH

01:20:20.482 --> 01:20:23.252 region:rollup2
AYE IS HAPPENING IN HIGHER ED

01:20:21.884 --> 01:20:25.254 region:rollup2
WITH HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS.

01:20:23.252 --> 01:20:27.289 region:rollup2
I KNOW THAT YOU KNOW THE UC'S

01:20:25.254 --> 01:20:27.990 region:rollup2
HAVE THE EARLY ACADEMIC OUTREACH

01:20:27.289 --> 01:20:29.792 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS.

01:20:27.990 --> 01:20:31.527 region:rollup2
A AND THAT YOU KNOW SEE SACK

01:20:29.792 --> 01:20:32.961 region:rollup2
HAS THE THAT THE YOU KNOW THE

01:20:31.527 --> 01:20:34.363 region:rollup2
CAL SO PROGRAMS.

01:20:32.961 --> 01:20:35.297 region:rollup2
THERE THERE'S A NUMBER OF

01:20:34.363 --> 01:20:36.999 region:rollup2
THINGS.

01:20:35.297 --> 01:20:38.767 region:rollup2
THAT ARE HAPPENING IN SO MAYBE

01:20:36.999 --> 01:20:40.669 region:rollup2
IT'S TRYING TO IDENTIFY ARE

01:20:38.767 --> 01:20:42.705 region:rollup2
THESE CLUSTERED JUST IN CERTAIN

01:20:40.669 --> 01:20:44.173 region:rollup2
REGIONS AND NOT IN OTHER REGIONS

01:20:42.705 --> 01:20:45.541 region:rollup2
AND MAYBE THAT'S WHERE IT NOW IF

01:20:44.173 --> 01:20:47.342 region:rollup2
WE START TO DESEGREGATE SOME OF

01:20:45.541 --> 01:20:48.243 region:rollup2
THE DATA. MAYBE THAT TELLS US

01:20:47.342 --> 01:20:50.979 region:rollup2
SOMETHING ELSE.

01:20:48.243 --> 01:20:51.613 region:rollup2
BUT THERE'S BEEN A HISTORY OF

01:20:50.979 --> 01:20:53.816 region:rollup2
EFFORTS

01:20:51.613 --> 01:20:55.417 region:rollup2
TO REACH OUT TO STUDENTS EARLY

01:20:53.816 --> 01:20:57.152 region:rollup2
ON AND TO HELP THEM HAVE A PLAN.

01:20:55.417 --> 01:20:57.986 region:rollup2
UP HAVING SAID THAT AND WE KNOW

01:20:57.152 --> 01:20:59.388 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW THERE'S A LOT OF TALK

01:20:57.986 --> 01:21:00.823 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE GUIDED PATHWAYS BUT

01:20:59.388 --> 01:21:02.958 region:rollup2
THE CONCEPT HAS BEEN AROUND FOR

01:21:00.823 --> 01:21:04.893 region:rollup2
DECADES HAVE STUDENTS HAVE A

01:21:02.958 --> 01:21:07.262 region:rollup2
PLAN. AND THAT'S NOT. A NEW

01:21:04.893 --> 01:21:10.165 region:rollup2
CONCEPT AND SO I GUESS THAT TO.

01:21:07.262 --> 01:21:11.667 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW. HOW DO WE THINK ABOUT

01:21:10.165 --> 01:21:13.235 region:rollup2
THAT BECAUSE THE CONCEPT ISN'T

01:21:11.667 --> 01:21:14.536 region:rollup2
NEW?

01:21:13.235 --> 01:21:16.271 region:rollup2
I WE'VE TRIED IT WE HAVE

01:21:14.536 --> 01:21:18.207 region:rollup2
TRANSFER AGREEMENTS WE HAVE YOU

01:21:16.271 --> 01:21:20.075 region:rollup2
KNOW THE A DEBT SEE WE HAD THE

01:21:18.207 --> 01:21:23.045 region:rollup2
CSU BREADTH REQUIREMENTS.

01:21:20.075 --> 01:21:24.646 region:rollup2
BACK BUT YOU KNOW HOW HOW DO WE

01:21:23.045 --> 01:21:26.215 region:rollup2
TACKLE IT BECAUSE THIS THIS

01:21:24.646 --> 01:21:27.649 region:rollup2
IDEAS BEEN AROUND FOR DECADES

01:21:26.215 --> 01:21:29.852 region:rollup2
THAT WE NEED TO REACH OUT TO

01:21:27.649 --> 01:21:31.987 region:rollup2
STUDENTS EARLY. BUT WE ALSO NEED

01:21:29.852 --> 01:21:33.322 region:rollup2
THEM TO HAVE A PLAN AND WE NEED

01:21:31.987 --> 01:21:34.623 region:rollup2
TO HELP THEM WITH THAT PLAN AND

01:21:33.322 --> 01:21:36.792 region:rollup2
I THINK WE'VE STRUGGLED.

01:21:34.623 --> 01:21:38.127 region:rollup2
IN HIGHER ED TO DO THAT WE'VE

01:21:36.792 --> 01:21:39.661 region:rollup2
MADE TUNES.

01:21:38.127 --> 01:21:40.629 region:rollup2
AND PERHAPS THOSE GAINS ARE

01:21:39.661 --> 01:21:42.831 region:rollup2
SUSTAIN WITH FUNDING AND THAT WE

01:21:40.629 --> 01:21:43.932 region:rollup2
SEE IT ROLL BACK ON AFTERWARDS

01:21:42.831 --> 01:21:45.167 region:rollup2
WERE LIKE YEA WEGOT OUR MARKS

01:21:43.932 --> 01:21:47.403 region:rollup2
UP YOU KNOW WE HAVE MORE

01:21:45.167 --> 01:21:47.936 region:rollup2
STUDENTS ENROLLED THERE MORE

01:21:47.403 --> 01:21:50.939 region:rollup2
APPLICANTS BUT.

01:21:47.936 --> 01:21:52.841 region:rollup2
HOW DO WE THINK ABOUT THAT NOW?

01:21:50.939 --> 01:21:54.143 region:rollup2
CAN YOU PLEASE. SO I AYE

01:21:52.841 --> 01:21:55.444 region:rollup2
MOONLIGHT AS CHAIR OF THE

01:21:54.143 --> 01:21:56.078 region:rollup2
STUDENT AID COMMISSION WHICH I

01:21:55.444 --> 01:21:56.612 region:rollup2
GUESS I SHOULD HAVE SAID BEFORE

01:21:56.078 --> 01:21:57.946 region:rollup2
I STARTED.

01:21:56.612 --> 01:21:58.981 region:rollup2
AND SO I WANTED TO TALK A

01:21:57.946 --> 01:22:00.549 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE KELSO

01:21:58.981 --> 01:22:01.683 region:rollup2
PROGRAM BECAUSE IT IS THE

01:22:00.549 --> 01:22:03.318 region:rollup2
STUDENT AID COMMISSIONS EFFORT

01:22:01.683 --> 01:22:04.753 region:rollup2
TO ACTUALLY GET THAT INFORMATION

01:22:03.318 --> 01:22:05.354 region:rollup2
TO STUDENTS EARLY TO MAKE SURE

01:22:04.753 --> 01:22:06.955 region:rollup2
THAT THEY'RE COMPLETING THEIR

01:22:05.354 --> 01:22:07.523 region:rollup2
FAT CITED I WORKED FOR KELSO FOR

01:22:06.955 --> 01:22:09.124 region:rollup2
NUMBER YEAH HOW I LIKE IT I

01:22:07.523 --> 01:22:09.925 region:rollup2
LIKE.

01:22:09.124 --> 01:22:11.760 region:rollup2
IT RUNS IN PAGE.

01:22:09.925 --> 01:22:13.362 region:rollup2
SO I THINK THE COUNCIL BUT THE

01:22:11.760 --> 01:22:14.696 region:rollup2
PART AND IT'S ALSO TRUE IS YOU

01:22:13.362 --> 01:22:15.631 region:rollup2
KNOW THAT WE DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE

01:22:14.696 --> 01:22:16.198 region:rollup2
CONCEPTS FOR EVERY REGION IN THE

01:22:15.631 --> 01:22:17.933 region:rollup2
STATE.

01:22:16.198 --> 01:22:19.067 region:rollup2
AND WE ARE NOW THINKING ABOUT

01:22:17.933 --> 01:22:21.336 region:rollup2
IT THIS DO NAY COMMISSION HOW

01:22:19.067 --> 01:22:23.005 region:rollup2
CAN WE RETHINK THAT ARE WE

01:22:21.336 --> 01:22:24.706 region:rollup2
SERVING THAT THE MOST AT NEED.

01:22:23.005 --> 01:22:26.508 region:rollup2
IMMEDIATE STUDENTS AND YOU KNOW

01:22:24.706 --> 01:22:27.910 region:rollup2
IDEALLY WE'D HAVE A COUNCIL FOR

01:22:26.508 --> 01:22:29.311 region:rollup2
EVERY REGION BUT THEY DON'T HAVE

01:22:27.910 --> 01:22:31.146 region:rollup2
THE RESOURCES FOR THAT SO THERE

01:22:29.311 --> 01:22:32.281 region:rollup2
IS A RESOURCE CONSTRAINTS. ON

01:22:31.146 --> 01:22:33.449 region:rollup2
BUT WE ARE VERY MINDFUL

01:22:32.281 --> 01:22:34.483 region:rollup2
PARTICULARLY WITH THIS ISSUE

01:22:33.449 --> 01:22:35.484 region:rollup2
RELATED TO LATINO STUDENTS AND

01:22:34.483 --> 01:22:37.386 region:rollup2
AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS AND

01:22:35.484 --> 01:22:38.520 region:rollup2
WE'RE LOOKING AT RATES. OF.

01:22:37.386 --> 01:22:40.622 region:rollup2
TRANCE OR NOT TRANSFER BUT

01:22:38.520 --> 01:22:42.925 region:rollup2
RATES OF MATRICULATION INTO A

01:22:40.622 --> 01:22:44.359 region:rollup2
CUP COLLEGE WHERE WE HAVE GAPS

01:22:42.925 --> 01:22:45.961 region:rollup2
AND WHERE WE HAVE GAPS BY REGION

01:22:44.359 --> 01:22:48.664 region:rollup2
SO THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IS ON.

01:22:45.961 --> 01:22:50.065 region:rollup2
THE AGENDA AND ON THE MINDS OF

01:22:48.664 --> 01:22:51.533 region:rollup2
THOSE OF US AT PEPSI SOCK.

01:22:50.065 --> 01:22:52.234 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF GUIDED PATHWAYS I

01:22:51.533 --> 01:22:54.369 region:rollup2
THINK THAT.

01:22:52.234 --> 01:22:56.605 region:rollup2
IT IS TRUE THAT WE HAVE SOME

01:22:54.369 --> 01:22:58.474 region:rollup2
SENSE OF WHAT THE PATHWAY

01:22:56.605 --> 01:23:00.075 region:rollup2
PERHAPS OUGHT TO BE.

01:22:58.474 --> 01:23:02.010 region:rollup2
I THINK THEY'RE A COUPLE OF OF

01:23:00.075 --> 01:23:03.479 region:rollup2
REAL CONSTRAINTS DEL AND THAT IS

01:23:02.010 --> 01:23:04.813 region:rollup2
THAT CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN

01:23:03.479 --> 01:23:06.815 region:rollup2
ENORMOUSLY COMPLEX HIGHER

01:23:04.813 --> 01:23:08.283 region:rollup2
EDUCATION SYSTEM.

01:23:06.815 --> 01:23:09.651 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW IT'S JUST REALLY HARD

01:23:08.283 --> 01:23:11.220 region:rollup2
IT'S HARD IF YOU'RE STUDENT AND

01:23:09.651 --> 01:23:12.654 region:rollup2
YOU'RE TRYING TO DECIDE YOU KNOW

01:23:11.220 --> 01:23:14.857 region:rollup2
I'M AT A COMMUNITY COLLEGE ACTS

01:23:12.654 --> 01:23:16.358 region:rollup2
AND I WANT TO TRANSFER TO MAYBE

01:23:14.857 --> 01:23:17.860 region:rollup2
A YOU SEE OR MAYBE A CS YOU. AND

01:23:16.358 --> 01:23:18.660 region:rollup2
GUESS WHAT THEY'RE NOT THE SAME

01:23:17.860 --> 01:23:20.696 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENTS FOR EVERY

01:23:18.660 --> 01:23:21.763 region:rollup2
INSTITUTION RIGHT SO I HAVE TO

01:23:20.696 --> 01:23:23.131 region:rollup2
FIGURE OUT WHAT COURSES I NEED

01:23:21.763 --> 01:23:24.666 region:rollup2
FOR THIS SCHOOL WITHOUT SCHOOL

01:23:23.131 --> 01:23:26.735 region:rollup2
AND FOR THE SCHOOL AND WHAT THAT

01:23:24.666 --> 01:23:28.737 region:rollup2
DOES IS THAT AND IT DRIVES

01:23:26.735 --> 01:23:29.938 region:rollup2
ENROLLMENT IT DRIVES GOD TIME TO

01:23:28.737 --> 01:23:32.107 region:rollup2
DEGREE. BECAUSE STUDENTS ARE

01:23:29.938 --> 01:23:34.243 region:rollup2
SPENDING LONGER IN SCHOOL TRYING

01:23:32.107 --> 01:23:35.344 region:rollup2
TO GET ALL OF THOSE COURSES SO

01:23:34.243 --> 01:23:35.878 region:rollup2
THAT THEY CAN THEN TRANSFER TO

01:23:35.344 --> 01:23:37.846 region:rollup2
THE INSTITUTION OR HAVE A

01:23:35.878 --> 01:23:39.081 region:rollup2
CHOICE.

01:23:37.846 --> 01:23:40.716 region:rollup2
CHOICE ABOUT WHAT INSTITUTION

01:23:39.081 --> 01:23:41.984 region:rollup2
THEM ON A TRANSFER TO SO THERE

01:23:40.716 --> 01:23:43.318 region:rollup2
ARE SOME REALLY LEGITIMATE

01:23:41.984 --> 01:23:44.720 region:rollup2
BARRIERS AND I KNOW THAT YOU

01:23:43.318 --> 01:23:46.355 region:rollup2
KNOW THERE'S THIS TENSION

01:23:44.720 --> 01:23:48.323 region:rollup2
BETWEEN THE INSTITUTIONAL.

01:23:46.355 --> 01:23:50.759 region:rollup2
DEMANDS FOR FOR ADMITTING

01:23:48.323 --> 01:23:51.860 region:rollup2
STUDENTS AND BOB THE PREPARATION

01:23:50.759 --> 01:23:53.395 region:rollup2
OF STUDENTS BUT I WOULD AGREE

01:23:51.860 --> 01:23:55.163 region:rollup2
THAT HAVING STUDENTS HAVE A PLAN

01:23:53.395 --> 01:23:56.465 region:rollup2
IS A PART OF IT BUT YOU CAN'T.

01:23:55.163 --> 01:23:57.966 region:rollup2
IT'S HARD HAVE A PLAN FOR FOUR

01:23:56.465 --> 01:23:59.234 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT OPTIONS

01:23:57.966 --> 01:24:00.636 region:rollup2
AND SO PART OF IT HAS TO DO WITH

01:23:59.234 --> 01:24:02.638 region:rollup2
SOME KIND OF STREAMLINING I

01:24:00.636 --> 01:24:04.139 region:rollup2
THINK ON THE OTHER SIDE. SO THAT

01:24:02.638 --> 01:24:05.707 region:rollup2
IT IS MUCH CLEARER TO STUDENTS

01:24:04.139 --> 01:24:07.609 region:rollup2
WHAT THE OPPORTUNITY STRUCTURE

01:24:05.707 --> 01:24:08.110 region:rollup2
IS IF THEY FOLLOW THE PLAN AND

01:24:07.609 --> 01:24:10.012 region:rollup2
THEY DON'T NEED HOW FOR

01:24:08.110 --> 01:24:11.346 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT PLANS.

01:24:10.012 --> 01:24:12.547 region:rollup2
CLINTON LET ME JUST ADD SO AS

01:24:11.346 --> 01:24:13.115 region:rollup2
USUAL I AGREE WITH EVERYTHING

01:24:12.547 --> 01:24:15.617 region:rollup2
LONG THEY SAID.

01:24:13.115 --> 01:24:17.386 region:rollup2
.

01:24:15.617 --> 01:24:18.754 region:rollup2
I WOULD I WOULD IDENTIFY THREE

01:24:17.386 --> 01:24:22.658 region:rollup2
CHARACTERISTICS OF WHAT'S

01:24:18.754 --> 01:24:23.892 region:rollup2
NECESSARY AND WHY SOME OF THESE.

01:24:22.658 --> 01:24:25.160 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS AND INTERVENTIONS

01:24:23.892 --> 01:24:27.195 region:rollup2
HAVEN'T HAVEN'T. MET WITH LONG

01:24:25.160 --> 01:24:28.163 region:rollup2
TERM SUCCESS AS AS YOU MENTIONED

01:24:27.195 --> 01:24:28.730 region:rollup2
SO FIRST I THINK WE NEED.

01:24:28.163 --> 01:24:31.633 region:rollup2
COMPREHENSIVE

01:24:28.730 --> 01:24:32.768 region:rollup2
PLANS

01:24:31.633 --> 01:24:34.303 region:rollup2
ESTHER IS HIT BY COMPREHENSIVE

01:24:32.768 --> 01:24:35.604 region:rollup2
THAT MEANS ACTUALLY

01:24:34.303 --> 01:24:36.872 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING ALL THE WAY FROM

01:24:35.604 --> 01:24:38.240 region:rollup2
NINTH GRADE TO HIGH SCHOOL

01:24:36.872 --> 01:24:40.309 region:rollup2
WHAT'S REQUIRED AS WELL AS

01:24:38.240 --> 01:24:42.110 region:rollup2
WHAT'S REQUIRED. ONCE YOU GET TO

01:24:40.309 --> 01:24:43.912 region:rollup2
COLLEGE DEPENDING ON WHAT PATH

01:24:42.110 --> 01:24:46.415 region:rollup2
YOU WANT TO PURSUE THEIR. I'D

01:24:43.912 --> 01:24:47.649 region:rollup2
ALSO SAY UNIVERSAL IF WE CALL

01:24:46.415 --> 01:24:49.217 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA THE UNIVERSE WHICH

01:24:47.649 --> 01:24:50.519 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA OFTEN DOES BUT.

01:24:49.217 --> 01:24:52.354 region:rollup2
WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS JUST THEY

01:24:50.519 --> 01:24:54.056 region:rollup2
CAN'T JUST BE ONE REGION OR ONE

01:24:52.354 --> 01:24:55.991 region:rollup2
PLACE OR ONE SCHOOL IT REALLY

01:24:54.056 --> 01:24:57.859 region:rollup2
NEEDS TO BE STATEWIDE ALL THE

01:24:55.991 --> 01:24:59.394 region:rollup2
WAY DOWN TO TELL A EVERY SCHOOL

01:24:57.859 --> 01:25:01.096 region:rollup2
DISTRICT AND EVERY COLLEGE IN

01:24:59.394 --> 01:25:03.031 region:rollup2
OUR STATE? AND THEN FINALLY

01:25:01.096 --> 01:25:03.632 region:rollup2
TIMING THAT HOUSE TO HAPPEN AT

01:25:03.031 --> 01:25:04.466 region:rollup2
THE RIGHT TIME IN A STUDENT'S

01:25:03.632 --> 01:25:06.134 region:rollup2
LIFE.

01:25:04.466 --> 01:25:07.803 region:rollup2
AND IN MANY CASES THAT MEANS

01:25:06.134 --> 01:25:09.037 region:rollup2
NINTH GRADE BEFORE YOU START

01:25:07.803 --> 01:25:10.305 region:rollup2
NIGHT GREAT ACTUALLY IN MIDDLE

01:25:09.037 --> 01:25:11.907 region:rollup2
SCHOOL SO THAT YOU KNOW WHAT YOU

01:25:10.305 --> 01:25:13.508 region:rollup2
NEED TO DO. WHEN YOU GET TO HIGH

01:25:11.907 --> 01:25:15.177 region:rollup2
SCHOOL UNDERSTANDING THE A

01:25:13.508 --> 01:25:16.979 region:rollup2
THROUGH G. COURSES IT'S HARD

01:25:15.177 --> 01:25:19.214 region:rollup2
ENOUGH FOR A COLLEGE EDUCATED

01:25:16.979 --> 01:25:19.982 region:rollup2
PARENTS TEND TO KNOW OKAY THESE

01:25:19.214 --> 01:25:20.949 region:rollup2
ARE A THREE G. THESE ARCADE

01:25:19.982 --> 01:25:22.985 region:rollup2
FRUITY.

01:25:20.949 --> 01:25:24.786 region:rollup2
LET ALONE FOR A STUDENT WHO

01:25:22.985 --> 01:25:26.922 region:rollup2
COMES FROM A FAMILY WHERE.

01:25:24.786 --> 01:25:29.257 region:rollup2
NONE NEITHER OF THE THAT THE

01:25:26.922 --> 01:25:29.825 region:rollup2
PARENTS HAVE GONE TO COLLEGE AND

01:25:29.257 --> 01:25:31.493 region:rollup2
SO.

01:25:29.825 --> 01:25:32.060 region:rollup2
AT THE END OF THE DAY I THINK

01:25:31.493 --> 01:25:34.262 region:rollup2
THEN THIS CALLS FOR

01:25:32.060 --> 01:25:36.031 region:rollup2
INSTITUTIONAL RESPONSES THAT ARE

01:25:34.262 --> 01:25:37.1000 region:rollup2
STUDENT CENTRIC.

01:25:36.031 --> 01:25:40.135 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS AND INTERVENTIONS

01:25:37.1000 --> 01:25:41.269 region:rollup2
RATHER THAN INSTITUTIONAL. ES TO

01:25:40.135 --> 01:25:42.104 region:rollup2
FIND FOCUSED AND WEEKS WERE

01:25:41.269 --> 01:25:42.604 region:rollup2
SAYING SOME OF THESE CHANGES

01:25:42.104 --> 01:25:44.773 region:rollup2
HAPPENING ALREADY SO FOR

01:25:42.604 --> 01:25:47.242 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE.

01:25:44.773 --> 01:25:49.144 region:rollup2
CAMPUSES THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES

01:25:47.242 --> 01:25:50.846 region:rollup2
CSU AND YOU SEE ARE THINKING

01:25:49.144 --> 01:25:53.148 region:rollup2
ABOUT COURSE SCHEDULES IN LIGHT

01:25:50.846 --> 01:25:54.883 region:rollup2
OF STUDENT DEMAND TO MEET THIS.

01:25:53.148 --> 01:25:56.451 region:rollup2
THAT THE PLANS THAT STUDENTS HOW

01:25:54.883 --> 01:25:58.353 region:rollup2
FOR THEM SO THAT STUDENTS CAN

01:25:56.451 --> 01:26:00.222 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY TAKE THE COURSES WHEN

01:25:58.353 --> 01:26:01.023 region:rollup2
THEY NEED TO TAKE THEM IN THE

01:26:00.222 --> 01:26:02.524 region:rollup2
NOT.

01:26:01.023 --> 01:26:03.859 region:rollup2
.

01:26:02.524 --> 01:26:04.493 region:rollup2
LOCKED OUT OF THE COURSE BECAUSE

01:26:03.859 --> 01:26:05.160 region:rollup2
THERE'S NOT SUFFICIENT ROOM SO

01:26:04.493 --> 01:26:07.362 region:rollup2
THERE'S SOME SIMPLE THINGS THAT

01:26:05.160 --> 01:26:09.164 region:rollup2
ARE HAPPENING. THAT SEEM TO BE.

01:26:07.362 --> 01:26:10.699 region:rollup2
ALREADY HELPING BUT THEY NEED

01:26:09.164 --> 01:26:11.466 region:rollup2
TO BE COMPREHENSIVE THEY NEED TO

01:26:10.699 --> 01:26:13.068 region:rollup2
BE.

01:26:11.466 --> 01:26:14.770 region:rollup2
ACROSS THE SYSTEM AND THEY NEED

01:26:13.068 --> 01:26:15.737 region:rollup2
TO BE AT THE RIGHT TIME.

01:26:14.770 --> 01:26:18.240 region:rollup2
I WOULD JUST WALK OUT AT ONE

01:26:15.737 --> 01:26:19.941 region:rollup2
NOTE THAT ADVISING IS ALSO A

01:26:18.240 --> 01:26:20.776 region:rollup2
HUGE PART OF THE THE.

01:26:19.941 --> 01:26:21.910 region:rollup2
A CHALLENGE THAT STUDENTS HAVE

01:26:20.776 --> 01:26:23.645 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF COMING UP WITH THOSE

01:26:21.910 --> 01:26:24.346 region:rollup2
PLANS BECAUSE DESPITE THE

01:26:23.645 --> 01:26:26.248 region:rollup2
INCREDIBLE.

01:26:24.346 --> 01:26:27.049 region:rollup2
AND AND MY KIDS WILL TELL YOU

01:26:26.248 --> 01:26:28.316 region:rollup2
THAT EVERYTHING THEY DO IT

01:26:27.049 --> 01:26:30.519 region:rollup2
THROUGH THE COMPUTER IT'S REALLY

01:26:28.316 --> 01:26:32.320 region:rollup2
HARD THROUGH GOOGLE OR YOU KNOW

01:26:30.519 --> 01:26:33.789 region:rollup2
AN ONLINE. JUST AN ONLINE.

01:26:32.320 --> 01:26:36.158 region:rollup2
.

01:26:33.789 --> 01:26:37.359 region:rollup2
AT A TOOL TO FIGURE OUT EXACTLY

01:26:36.158 --> 01:26:39.027 region:rollup2
HOW YOU'RE GONNA NAVIGATE THESE

01:26:37.359 --> 01:26:40.395 region:rollup2
VERY COMPLEX SYSTEMS AND WE

01:26:39.027 --> 01:26:42.164 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE THE KIND OF ADVISING

01:26:40.395 --> 01:26:44.199 region:rollup2
ON THE HIGH ON THE HIGHER ED

01:26:42.164 --> 01:26:45.167 region:rollup2
SIDE OR ON THE K. TWELVE SIDE TO

01:26:44.199 --> 01:26:46.668 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY HELP STUDENTS IN NINTH

01:26:45.167 --> 01:26:47.669 region:rollup2
GRADE. OR TENTH OR ELEVENTH OR

01:26:46.668 --> 01:26:49.805 region:rollup2
TWELFTH GRADE FIGURE OUT WHAT

01:26:47.669 --> 01:26:51.173 region:rollup2
THAT PATHWAYS.

01:26:49.805 --> 01:26:53.175 region:rollup2
YOU WE HAVE THE AND ANY

01:26:51.173 --> 01:26:54.609 region:rollup2
INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE LOOKING AT

01:26:53.175 --> 01:26:56.378 region:rollup2
KIND OF OUT OF THE BOX ADVISING

01:26:54.609 --> 01:26:59.614 region:rollup2
MODELS.

01:26:56.378 --> 01:27:00.449 region:rollup2
WHETHER IT'S YOU KNOWOFF HOURS

01:26:59.614 --> 01:27:03.085 region:rollup2
WEEKEND HOURS.

01:27:00.449 --> 01:27:04.553 region:rollup2
I MEAN I FEEL LIKE I DO

01:27:03.085 --> 01:27:06.421 region:rollup2
ANYTHING TECH AND I GOT ONLINE

01:27:04.553 --> 01:27:08.423 region:rollup2
ADVISING NOW I DON'T KNOW.

01:27:06.421 --> 01:27:08.957 region:rollup2
IF THERE'S OTHER MODELS TO

01:27:08.423 --> 01:27:10.726 region:rollup2
CONSIDER.

01:27:08.957 --> 01:27:11.993 region:rollup2
LIKE I DON'T KNOW THAT I'LL BE

01:27:10.726 --> 01:27:13.328 region:rollup2
ABLE TO COME UP WITH ENDING ON

01:27:11.993 --> 01:27:14.696 region:rollup2
THE SPOT BUT I KNOW THAT WHEN

01:27:13.328 --> 01:27:17.099 region:rollup2
THE GOVERNOR HAD HIS INNOVATION

01:27:14.696 --> 01:27:18.433 region:rollup2
PRIZE. OF THE FIRST TIME WHICH I

01:27:17.099 --> 01:27:20.235 region:rollup2
THINK WAS IN TWENTY FIFTEEN

01:27:18.433 --> 01:27:22.304 region:rollup2
OTHER WERE THINK WHERE ABOUT.

01:27:20.235 --> 01:27:24.272 region:rollup2
FIFTY NINE APPLICATIONS AND AT

01:27:22.304 --> 01:27:26.074 region:rollup2
LEAST FORTY TWO OF THEM REALLY

01:27:24.272 --> 01:27:27.943 region:rollup2
SPOKE TO GAPS IN ADVISING OUR

01:27:26.074 --> 01:27:29.244 region:rollup2
HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEMS UP AND

01:27:27.943 --> 01:27:30.479 region:rollup2
A LOT OF THE INNOVATIONS THAT

01:27:29.244 --> 01:27:32.114 region:rollup2
WERE THEN BEING PROPOSED WORK

01:27:30.479 --> 01:27:33.648 region:rollup2
INNOVATIONS TO GET IT HOW DO YOU

01:27:32.114 --> 01:27:35.217 region:rollup2
FIX THE ADVISING FUNCTION OR

01:27:33.648 --> 01:27:36.785 region:rollup2
IMPROVING ADVISING FUNCTION.

01:27:35.217 --> 01:27:37.953 region:rollup2
WITHIN HIGHER EDUCATION SO I

01:27:36.785 --> 01:27:39.688 region:rollup2
THINK THAT THERE ARE SOME MODELS

01:27:37.953 --> 01:27:41.089 region:rollup2
OUT THERE ON THE NOT BE HAPPY TO

01:27:39.688 --> 01:27:41.423 region:rollup2
KIND OF LOOK THROUGH IT AND AND

01:27:41.089 --> 01:27:43.658 region:rollup2
PASSED ALONG.

01:27:41.423 --> 01:27:44.860 region:rollup2
OF.

01:27:43.658 --> 01:27:45.994 region:rollup2
RANDY AND MISLEAD BONE.

01:27:44.860 --> 01:27:48.296 region:rollup2
YOUR DISCUSSION GIVES ME AN

01:27:45.994 --> 01:27:49.998 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY TO RECOGNIZE I SEE

01:27:48.296 --> 01:27:51.600 region:rollup2
OUT IN THE AUDIENCE

01:27:49.998 --> 01:27:53.535 region:rollup2
A SEVERAL OF THE.

01:27:51.600 --> 01:27:55.270 region:rollup2
COLLEGE COUNSELORS OF THAT I

01:27:53.535 --> 01:27:56.771 region:rollup2
SAW LAST NIGHT AND.

01:27:55.270 --> 01:27:59.307 region:rollup2

SCHOOL TEACHER.

01:28:04.813 --> 01:28:08.683 region:rollup2
THE FACT

01:28:06.948 --> 01:28:11.686 region:rollup2
THAT AS WE TALK ABOUT COUNSELING

01:28:08.683 --> 01:28:13.054 region:rollup2
THE OVER BURDEN OF STUDENTS THE

01:28:11.686 --> 01:28:15.657 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF STUDENTS THAT THE

01:28:13.054 --> 01:28:16.892 region:rollup2
COUNSELORS. HAVE TO DEAL WITH A

01:28:15.657 --> 01:28:18.560 region:rollup2
IN THEIR LOAD SO THAT YOU KNOW

01:28:59.935 --> 01:29:03.672 region:rollup2
RESEARCH SHOWING WHAT IS

01:29:01.503 --> 01:29:05.273 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVE AND SIGNIFICANTLY.

01:29:03.672 --> 01:29:06.408 region:rollup2
INCREASES THE DEGREE ATTAINMENT

01:29:05.273 --> 01:29:08.176 region:rollup2

NDRC IS A NONPROFIT NONPARTISAN

01:29:25.760 --> 01:29:29.130 region:rollup2
EDUCATION AND SOCIAL POLICY

01:29:27.562 --> 01:29:30.432 region:rollup2
RESEARCH ORGANIZATION.

01:29:29.130 --> 01:29:31.733 region:rollup2
WE'RE DEDICATED TO FINDING WHAT

01:29:30.432 --> 01:29:33.335 region:rollup2
WORKS TO IMPROVE THE LIVES OF

01:29:31.733 --> 01:29:35.070 region:rollup2
LOW INCOME PEOPLE.

01:29:33.335 --> 01:29:36.404 region:rollup2
AND POST SECONDARY EDUCATION WE

01:29:35.070 --> 01:29:38.273 region:rollup2
EVALUATE PROGRAMS AROUND THE

01:29:36.404 --> 01:29:40.775 region:rollup2
COUNTRY AND WE TRY NEW SOLUTIONS

01:29:38.273 --> 01:29:42.444 region:rollup2
AND TEST THEM BASED ON RESEARCH.

01:29:40.775 --> 01:29:43.912 region:rollup2
WE HAVE OFFICES BOTH IN OAKLAND

01:29:42.444 --> 01:29:45.213 region:rollup2
AND IN LOS ANGELES AND WE'VE

01:29:43.912 --> 01:29:46.648 region:rollup2
TESTED MANY PROGRAMS IN

01:29:45.213 --> 01:29:48.984 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA INCLUDING A STATEWIDE

01:29:46.648 --> 01:29:49.885 region:rollup2
SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM.

01:29:48.984 --> 01:29:51.620 region:rollup2
THERE ARE THREE POINTS ALLEN

01:29:49.885 --> 01:29:53.021 region:rollup2
EMPHASIZED MY RESEARCH BEFORE I

01:29:51.620 --> 01:29:54.623 region:rollup2
TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE PROGRAMS

01:29:53.021 --> 01:29:56.791 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAVE EVALUATED.

01:29:54.623 --> 01:29:57.626 region:rollup2
FIRST SHORT TERM PROGRAMS TEND

01:29:56.791 --> 01:29:59.194 region:rollup2
TO HAVE MODEST SHORT TERM

01:29:57.626 --> 01:30:00.629 region:rollup2
RESULTS

01:29:59.194 --> 01:30:02.230 region:rollup2
WELL THIS MEANS THAT SOMETIMES

01:30:00.629 --> 01:30:03.765 region:rollup2
FALL SHORT OF THEIR GOALS THE

01:30:02.230 --> 01:30:04.900 region:rollup2
FINDING STILL PROVIDE LESSONS

01:30:03.765 --> 01:30:05.600 region:rollup2
THAT WE CAN BUILD ON AND THE

01:30:04.900 --> 01:30:07.168 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS THEMSELVES ARE

01:30:05.600 --> 01:30:08.536 region:rollup2
HAPPENING ARE HELPING STUDENTS

01:30:07.168 --> 01:30:10.438 region:rollup2
ADVANCE. WHILE THE PROGRAMS ARE

01:30:08.536 --> 01:30:12.107 region:rollup2
OPERATING.

01:30:10.438 --> 01:30:12.674 region:rollup2
SECOND IT IS POSSIBLE TO

01:30:12.107 --> 01:30:14.909 region:rollup2
DRAMATICALLY IMPROVE STUDENT

01:30:12.674 --> 01:30:15.977 region:rollup2
OUTCOMES.

01:30:14.909 --> 01:30:17.212 region:rollup2
WE'VE SEEN THIS A COUPLE OF

01:30:15.977 --> 01:30:18.146 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS THAT I'M GONNA TALK

01:30:17.212 --> 01:30:20.015 region:rollup2
ABOUT AND HIGHLIGHT IN MY

01:30:18.146 --> 01:30:21.716 region:rollup2
TESTIMONY TODAY.

01:30:20.015 --> 01:30:23.351 region:rollup2
AND THIRD COMBINING AND

01:30:21.716 --> 01:30:24.986 region:rollup2
INTEGRATING MULTIPLE EVIDENCE

01:30:23.351 --> 01:30:25.987 region:rollup2
BASED STRATEGIES TO ADDRESS

01:30:24.986 --> 01:30:28.923 region:rollup2
MULTIPLE FACTORS CAN BE HIGHLY

01:30:25.987 --> 01:30:29.925 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVE.

01:30:28.923 --> 01:30:31.026 region:rollup2
MOST OF THE FINDINGS I'M GOING

01:30:29.925 --> 01:30:32.961 region:rollup2
TO DISCUSS TODAY ARE FROM

01:30:31.026 --> 01:30:34.162 region:rollup2
RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIALS.

01:30:32.961 --> 01:30:35.563 region:rollup2
AND A RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIAL

01:30:34.162 --> 01:30:37.766 region:rollup2
STUDENTS ARE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED

01:30:35.563 --> 01:30:38.967 region:rollup2
BY LOTTERY EITHER TO PARTICIPATE

01:30:37.766 --> 01:30:40.602 region:rollup2
IN A NEW PROGRAM. OR TO A

01:30:38.967 --> 01:30:41.836 region:rollup2
CONTROL GROUP.

01:30:40.602 --> 01:30:43.204 region:rollup2
STUDENTS IN THE CONTROL GROUP

01:30:41.836 --> 01:30:44.205 region:rollup2
CANNOT PARTICIPATE IN THE NEW

01:30:43.204 --> 01:30:45.807 region:rollup2
PROGRAM BUT THEY STILL HAVE

01:30:44.205 --> 01:30:46.741 region:rollup2
ACCESS TO ALL OF THE EXISTING

01:30:45.807 --> 01:30:48.710 region:rollup2
SERVICES THAT THEY WOULD

01:30:46.741 --> 01:30:49.844 region:rollup2
NORMALLY HAVE ACCESS TO.

01:30:48.710 --> 01:30:50.679 region:rollup2
RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIALS OF THE

01:30:49.844 --> 01:30:52.314 region:rollup2
GOLD STANDARD AND EVALUATION

01:30:50.679 --> 01:30:53.415 region:rollup2
RESEARCH.

01:30:52.314 --> 01:30:54.916 region:rollup2
THEY'RE THE SAME AT THAT YOU

01:30:53.415 --> 01:30:57.585 region:rollup2
THINK CLINICAL TRIALS TO

01:30:54.916 --> 01:30:58.820 region:rollup2
EVALUATE NEW MEDICAL TREATMENTS.

01:30:57.585 --> 01:30:59.688 region:rollup2
AND HERE IT IS EVALUATED A

01:30:58.820 --> 01:31:01.489 region:rollup2
VARIETY OF PROGRAMS ACROSS THE

01:30:59.688 --> 01:31:02.657 region:rollup2
COUNTRY.

01:31:01.489 --> 01:31:03.992 region:rollup2
THESE INCLUDE FINANCIAL AID

01:31:02.657 --> 01:31:05.493 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS LIKE PERFORMANCE BASED

01:31:03.992 --> 01:31:07.128 region:rollup2
SCHOLARSHIPS AND DIFFERENT WAYS

01:31:05.493 --> 01:31:08.396 region:rollup2
TO DISPERSE STUDENTS REMAINING

01:31:07.128 --> 01:31:09.564 region:rollup2
PAUL REFUNDS.

01:31:08.396 --> 01:31:11.166 region:rollup2
INCLUDE LEARNING COMMUNITIES

01:31:09.564 --> 01:31:12.200 region:rollup2
ENHANCE STUDENT SERVICES

01:31:11.166 --> 01:31:14.035 region:rollup2
INCLUDING ADDITIONAL VISITS TO

01:31:12.200 --> 01:31:15.570 region:rollup2
ADVISORS.

01:31:14.035 --> 01:31:17.505 region:rollup2
AND STOOD ON.

01:31:15.570 --> 01:31:18.807 region:rollup2
AND STUDENT SUCCESS COURSES

01:31:17.505 --> 01:31:20.608 region:rollup2
WE'VE STARTED INSTRUCTIONAL

01:31:18.807 --> 01:31:21.910 region:rollup2
REFORMS AND WERE NOW STUDYING

01:31:20.608 --> 01:31:23.311 region:rollup2
INCREASINGLY BEHAVIORAL

01:31:21.910 --> 01:31:24.779 region:rollup2
INTERVENTIONS AND COMPREHENSIVE

01:31:23.311 --> 01:31:26.915 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS THAT COMBINE MULTIPLE

01:31:24.779 --> 01:31:28.483 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT STRATEGIES.

01:31:26.915 --> 01:31:29.818 region:rollup2
WHEN WE LOOK ACROSS THE STUDIES

01:31:28.483 --> 01:31:31.019 region:rollup2
WE FIND THAT SHORT TERM PROGRAMS

01:31:29.818 --> 01:31:33.188 region:rollup2
THAT LAST FOR ONE OR TWO

01:31:31.019 --> 01:31:35.457 region:rollup2
SEMESTERS GENERALLY PRODUCE

01:31:33.188 --> 01:31:36.624 region:rollup2
MODEST SHORT TERM RESULTS.

01:31:35.457 --> 01:31:37.959 region:rollup2
HOWEVER WHEN SEVERAL THESE

01:31:36.624 --> 01:31:39.828 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS ARE COMBINED INTO AN

01:31:37.959 --> 01:31:41.029 region:rollup2
INTEGRATED STRATEGY AND WHEN

01:31:39.828 --> 01:31:42.864 region:rollup2
STUDENTS EXPERIENCE THEM FROM

01:31:41.029 --> 01:31:44.432 region:rollup2
SEMESTER TO SEMESTER THE TOTAL

01:31:42.864 --> 01:31:46.001 region:rollup2
EFFECT CAN BE DRAMATIC.

01:31:44.432 --> 01:31:47.669 region:rollup2
THE MOST EFFECTIVE PROGRAM WE'VE

01:31:46.001 --> 01:31:49.537 region:rollup2
STUDIED IS THE CITY UNIVERSITY

01:31:47.669 --> 01:31:50.739 region:rollup2
OF NEW YORK'S XCELERATED STUDY

01:31:49.537 --> 01:31:52.741 region:rollup2
AND ASSOCIATE PROGRAMS.

01:31:50.739 --> 01:31:53.942 region:rollup2
KNOWN AS A SAP.

01:31:52.741 --> 01:31:55.810 region:rollup2
A STEP INTEGRATES MULTIPLE

01:31:53.942 --> 01:31:57.078 region:rollup2
STRATEGIES

01:31:55.810 --> 01:31:58.780 region:rollup2
IT REQUIRES STUDENTS TO ENROLL

01:31:57.078 --> 01:32:00.482 region:rollup2
FULL TIME AND IT SUPPORTS THEM

01:31:58.780 --> 01:32:02.650 region:rollup2
TO DO THIS.

01:32:00.482 --> 01:32:04.619 region:rollup2
TUITION WAIVERS WITH TEXTBOOKS

01:32:02.650 --> 01:32:05.920 region:rollup2
WITH TEXTBOOK VOUCHERS AND WITH

01:32:04.619 --> 01:32:07.088 region:rollup2
THREE METRO CARDS THAT CAN BE

01:32:05.920 --> 01:32:08.790 region:rollup2
USED FOR UNLIMITED USE ON PUBLIC

01:32:07.088 --> 01:32:09.824 region:rollup2
TRANSPORTATION.

01:32:08.790 --> 01:32:11.459 region:rollup2
A STEP ALSO PROVIDES

01:32:09.824 --> 01:32:12.961 region:rollup2
COMPREHENSIVE SUPPORT SERVICES

01:32:11.459 --> 01:32:14.496 region:rollup2
SUCH AS REGULAR HIGH TOUCH

01:32:12.961 --> 01:32:16.531 region:rollup2
ADVISING. CAREER DEVELOPMENT

01:32:14.496 --> 01:32:18.767 region:rollup2
AND TUTORING.

01:32:16.531 --> 01:32:20.502 region:rollup2
A SAP IS BOTH AN OPPORTUNITY AND

01:32:18.767 --> 01:32:21.970 region:rollup2
AN OBLIGATION FOR STUDENTS.

01:32:20.502 --> 01:32:23.271 region:rollup2
IN ORDER TO RECEIVE THE METRO

01:32:21.970 --> 01:32:24.406 region:rollup2
CARDS AND THE OTHER BENEFITS OF

01:32:23.271 --> 01:32:25.673 region:rollup2
THE PROGRAM

01:32:24.406 --> 01:32:27.308 region:rollup2
STUDENTS MUST BE WITH THEIR

01:32:25.673 --> 01:32:27.776 region:rollup2
ADVISOR TWICE A MONTH AND

01:32:27.308 --> 01:32:29.344 region:rollup2
SATISFY OTHER PROGRAM

01:32:27.776 --> 01:32:30.512 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENTS.

01:32:29.344 --> 01:32:32.280 region:rollup2
THE PROGRAM LASTS FOR THREE FULL

01:32:30.512 --> 01:32:33.515 region:rollup2
YEARS.

01:32:32.280 --> 01:32:34.616 region:rollup2
OUR VALUATION FOUND THAT IT

01:32:33.515 --> 01:32:36.384 region:rollup2
NEARLY DOUBLED THE THREE YEAR

01:32:34.616 --> 01:32:37.352 region:rollup2
GRADUATION RATE INCREASING AT

01:32:36.384 --> 01:32:38.987 region:rollup2
FROM TWENTY TWO PERCENT TO FORTY

01:32:37.352 --> 01:32:40.021 region:rollup2
PERCENT.

01:32:38.987 --> 01:32:41.356 region:rollup2
NOW THESE ARE ALL STUDENTS WHO

01:32:40.021 --> 01:32:43.625 region:rollup2
ENTERED INTENDING TO EARN A TWO

01:32:41.356 --> 01:32:45.293 region:rollup2
YEAR DEGREE. AND THE SUB SUBJECT

01:32:43.625 --> 01:32:46.494 region:rollup2
OF REMEDIATION CAME UP EARLIER

01:32:45.293 --> 01:32:48.696 region:rollup2
ALL OF THE STUDENTS NEEDED

01:32:46.494 --> 01:32:50.031 region:rollup2
REMEDIATION. ACCEPTED NOTHING

01:32:48.696 --> 01:32:51.666 region:rollup2
AND NOTHING INSIDE OF THE

01:32:50.031 --> 01:32:53.601 region:rollup2
CLASSROOM THIS IS ALL AROUND

01:32:51.666 --> 01:32:54.903 region:rollup2
SUPPORT SERVICES AND IT NEARLY

01:32:53.601 --> 01:32:57.005 region:rollup2
DOUBLED THE TWO YEAR COULD THE

01:32:54.903 --> 01:32:58.139 region:rollup2
THREE YEAR GRADUATION RATE.

01:32:57.005 --> 01:33:00.108 region:rollup2
GIVEN THE STRENGTH OF THE

01:32:58.139 --> 01:33:01.943 region:rollup2
FINDINGS UNION NDRC PARTNER TO

01:33:00.108 --> 01:33:03.378 region:rollup2
BRING A SAP TO THE A SET MODEL

01:33:01.943 --> 01:33:04.646 region:rollup2
TO OTHER STATES.

01:33:03.378 --> 01:33:06.681 region:rollup2
THREE COLLEGES IN OHIO HAVE NOW

01:33:04.646 --> 01:33:07.148 region:rollup2
REPLICATED THE PROGRAM AND THE

01:33:06.681 --> 01:33:08.450 region:rollup2
EARLY RESULTS ARE VERY

01:33:07.148 --> 01:33:09.818 region:rollup2
PROMISING.

01:33:08.450 --> 01:33:11.386 region:rollup2
BY JUST A SECOND SEMESTER THE

01:33:09.818 --> 01:33:12.987 region:rollup2
PROGRAM INCREASED ENROLLMENT BY

01:33:11.386 --> 01:33:14.155 region:rollup2
TWELVE PERCENTAGE POINTS AND

01:33:12.987 --> 01:33:14.689 region:rollup2
INCREASED FULL TIME ENROLLMENT

01:33:14.155 --> 01:33:16.624 region:rollup2
BY TWENTY FOUR PERCENTAGE

01:33:14.689 --> 01:33:17.358 region:rollup2
POINTS.

01:33:16.624 --> 01:33:18.893 region:rollup2
STUDENTS ARE ALSO EARNING MORE

01:33:17.358 --> 01:33:20.395 region:rollup2
CREDITS.

01:33:18.893 --> 01:33:21.729 region:rollup2
THESE RESULTS ALIGN CLOSELY WITH

01:33:20.395 --> 01:33:22.964 region:rollup2
WHAT WE OBSERVED AT A SIMILAR

01:33:21.729 --> 01:33:24.833 region:rollup2
TIME POINT IN THE ORIGINAL CUNY

01:33:22.964 --> 01:33:26.034 region:rollup2
A STEP PROGRAM.

01:33:24.833 --> 01:33:27.135 region:rollup2
WE ARE NOW WORKING WITH TWO

01:33:26.034 --> 01:33:28.870 region:rollup2
OTHER COLLEGES TO IMPLEMENT A

01:33:27.135 --> 01:33:31.139 region:rollup2
SAP INCLUDING SKYLINE COMMUNITY

01:33:28.870 --> 01:33:32.373 region:rollup2
COLLEGE IN CALIFORNIA.

01:33:31.139 --> 01:33:33.541 region:rollup2
AND ANOTHER EXAMPLE WE'VE BEEN

01:33:32.373 --> 01:33:35.043 region:rollup2
WORKING WITH THE DETROIT CHAMBER

01:33:33.541 --> 01:33:37.178 region:rollup2
OF COMMERCE WHICH ADMINISTERS

DATA MANAGEMENT INFORMATION

01:34:48.583 --> 01:34:52.153 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS ARE IMPORTANT AND THEY

01:34:50.451 --> 01:34:53.188 region:rollup2
CAN ALSO LEAD TO EFFICIENCIES.

01:34:52.153 --> 01:34:54.722 region:rollup2
THEY CAN BE IS THE MONITOR

AUTOMATE MESSAGING FOR FREEING

01:34:56.558 --> 01:34:59.294 region:rollup2
UP STAFF TIME SO THAT STAFF CAN

01:34:58.293 --> 01:35:01.162 region:rollup2
FOCUS ON MORE CHALLENGING

01:34:59.294 --> 01:35:02.096 region:rollup2
STUDENT ISSUES.

01:35:01.162 --> 01:35:03.531 region:rollup2
EVEN THE MOST SUCCESSFUL

01:35:02.096 --> 01:35:05.066 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS THOSE LEAVE MANY

01:35:03.531 --> 01:35:06.434 region:rollup2
STUDENTS WITHOUT GOOD ACADEMIC

01:35:05.066 --> 01:35:08.169 region:rollup2
OUTCOMES AND THERE'S STILL A LOT

01:35:06.434 --> 01:35:10.138 region:rollup2
OF WORK TO DO.

01:35:08.169 --> 01:35:10.905 region:rollup2
AND THE CUNY A SAP EXAMPLE.

01:35:10.138 --> 01:35:12.040 region:rollup2
SIXTY PERCENT OF THE STUDENTS

01:35:10.905 --> 01:35:13.608 region:rollup2
HAD NOT EARNED A DEGREE AFTER

01:35:12.040 --> 01:35:15.043 region:rollup2
THREE YEARS.

01:35:13.608 --> 01:35:17.078 region:rollup2
SO WE'RE CONTINUING TO FAST NEW

01:35:15.043 --> 01:35:18.246 region:rollup2
APPROACHES TO FILL THE GAP.

01:35:17.078 --> 01:35:18.746 region:rollup2
THE DATA CENTERS MATHEMATICS

01:35:18.246 --> 01:35:20.415 region:rollup2
PATHWAYS IN TEXAS IS ONE

01:35:18.746 --> 01:35:21.783 region:rollup2
APPROACH

01:35:20.415 --> 01:35:22.884 region:rollup2
THIS IS A MAJOR INSTRUCTIONAL

01:35:21.783 --> 01:35:24.619 region:rollup2
REFORM OF DEVELOPMENTAL OR

01:35:22.884 --> 01:35:26.020 region:rollup2
REMEDIAL MATH.

01:35:24.619 --> 01:35:27.155 region:rollup2
INSTEAD OF TEACHING ALGEBRA TO

01:35:26.020 --> 01:35:28.590 region:rollup2
ALL STUDENTS THE PROGRAM OFFERS

STATISTICS

01:35:28.590 --> 01:35:31.793 region:rollup2
AND QUANTITATIVE PATHWAYS THAT

01:35:30.024 --> 01:35:33.428 region:rollup2
ALIGN WITH STUDENTS MAJORS.

01:35:31.793 --> 01:35:34.996 region:rollup2
AND STRUCTURES INSTRUCTORS ALSO

01:35:33.428 --> 01:35:36.464 region:rollup2
AVOID LECTURING AND THEY FOCUS

01:35:34.996 --> 01:35:37.932 region:rollup2
MORE ON INTERACTIVE FORMS OF

01:35:36.464 --> 01:35:39.467 region:rollup2
STUDENT LEARNING THEIR EARLY

01:35:37.932 --> 01:35:40.868 region:rollup2
RESULTS ARE PROMISING AND THIS

01:35:39.467 --> 01:35:41.669 region:rollup2
ALSO RELATES TO THE PROGRAM THAT

01:35:40.868 --> 01:35:43.338 region:rollup2

PROGRAM THAT LINE I MENTIONED.

01:36:09.964 --> 01:36:12.667 region:rollup2
A KEY LESSON FROM OUR RESEARCH

01:36:11.499 --> 01:36:14.135 region:rollup2
IS THAT COMBINING AND

01:36:12.667 --> 01:36:15.570 region:rollup2
INTEGRATING MULTIPLE STRATEGIES

01:36:14.135 --> 01:36:17.405 region:rollup2

01:36:30.451 --> 01:36:35.923 region:rollup2
THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU

01:36:32.153 --> 01:36:36.324 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS YOUR COMMENTS.

01:36:35.923 --> 01:36:38.393 region:rollup2
BUT A QUESTION TO.

01:36:36.324 --> 01:36:39.861 region:rollup2
.

01:36:38.393 --> 01:36:41.329 region:rollup2
IN INDIA STUDIES THAT YOU'VE

01:36:39.861 --> 01:36:42.797 region:rollup2
DONE AND AND OTHER STATES

01:36:41.329 --> 01:36:44.298 region:rollup2
OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA.

01:36:42.797 --> 01:36:45.566 region:rollup2
I I I.

01:36:44.298 --> 01:36:48.002 region:rollup2
I BELIEVE YOU FACE THE SAME

01:36:45.566 --> 01:36:49.070 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES OF FOR STUDENTS AND

01:36:48.002 --> 01:36:50.872 region:rollup2
ROLLING BUT NOT COMPLETING.

01:36:49.070 --> 01:36:51.973 region:rollup2
DEGREES.

01:36:50.872 --> 01:36:53.307 region:rollup2
SO WHAT WHAT HAS BEEN THE

01:36:51.973 --> 01:36:54.309 region:rollup2
BIGGEST CHALLENGES THAT YOU'VE

01:36:53.307 --> 01:36:57.278 region:rollup2
FOUND.

01:36:54.309 --> 01:36:59.080 region:rollup2
FOR STUDENTS IN AND COMPLETELY.

01:36:57.278 --> 01:37:00.114 region:rollup2
AND COMPLAINING THERE THERE ARE

01:36:59.080 --> 01:37:01.482 region:rollup2
A LOT OF CHALLENGES A STUDENT'S

01:37:00.114 --> 01:37:02.450 region:rollup2
FACE AND IT'S HARD TO PUT YOUR

01:37:01.482 --> 01:37:05.820 region:rollup2
FINGER ON ONE BUT I THINK

01:37:02.450 --> 01:37:06.354 region:rollup2
REMEDIATION IS PROBABLY ONE OF

01:37:05.820 --> 01:37:07.455 region:rollup2
THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES.

01:37:06.354 --> 01:37:08.122 region:rollup2
PARTICULARLY COMMUNITY COLLEGES

01:37:07.455 --> 01:37:10.458 region:rollup2
BUT AS YOU KNOW AND IT'S WHAT WE

01:37:08.122 --> 01:37:11.659 region:rollup2
TALKED ABOUT THE LAST DISCUSSION

01:37:10.458 --> 01:37:12.994 region:rollup2
ALSO A FOUR YEAR INSTITUTIONS.

01:37:11.659 --> 01:37:13.761 region:rollup2
STUDENTS ARE COMING IN AND

01:37:12.994 --> 01:37:15.296 region:rollup2
THEY'RE UNDER PREPARED FOR

01:37:13.761 --> 01:37:16.798 region:rollup2
COLLEGE AND THEY HAVE TO TAKE

01:37:15.296 --> 01:37:17.699 region:rollup2
REMEDIAL COURSES BEFORE THEY CAN

01:37:16.798 --> 01:37:19.367 region:rollup2
EVEN GET INTO CREDIT BEARING

01:37:17.699 --> 01:37:20.401 region:rollup2
COURSES.

01:37:19.367 --> 01:37:22.303 region:rollup2
SO WE'VE DONE A LOT OF WORK

01:37:20.401 --> 01:37:22.870 region:rollup2
AROUND THIS ISSUE WERE ALSO

01:37:22.303 --> 01:37:24.405 region:rollup2
WORKING WITH THE COMMUNITY

01:37:22.870 --> 01:37:25.873 region:rollup2
COLLEGE RESEARCH CENTER ON A

01:37:24.405 --> 01:37:27.608 region:rollup2
NATIONAL CENTER TO START TO

01:37:25.873 --> 01:37:29.143 region:rollup2
STUDY STRATEGIES. THE

01:37:27.608 --> 01:37:31.045 region:rollup2
DATACENTERS MATHEMATICS PATHWAY

01:37:29.143 --> 01:37:32.380 region:rollup2
THAT I MENTIONED AS ONE OF THE

01:37:31.045 --> 01:37:33.715 region:rollup2
STRATEGIES THAT'S DESIGNED TO

01:37:32.380 --> 01:37:35.383 region:rollup2
CHANGE THE WAY DEVELOPMENTAL

01:37:33.715 --> 01:37:36.751 region:rollup2
REMEDIAL MATHIS TAUGHT. SO THAT

01:37:35.383 --> 01:37:39.087 region:rollup2
STUDENTS CAN PROGRESS THROUGH

01:37:36.751 --> 01:37:40.722 region:rollup2
MORE QUICKLY OR THINK VERY EARLY

01:37:39.087 --> 01:37:42.223 region:rollup2
PROMISING RESULTS WE HAVE

01:37:40.722 --> 01:37:43.391 region:rollup2
ANOTHER MAJOR STUDY AS PART OF

01:37:42.223 --> 01:37:45.193 region:rollup2
THAT CENTER WHICH IS AROUND

01:37:43.391 --> 01:37:47.295 region:rollup2
USING MULTIPLE MEASURES LIVE

01:37:45.193 --> 01:37:49.430 region:rollup2
RESULTS COMING OUT SOON FROM. A

01:37:47.295 --> 01:37:50.998 region:rollup2
SEVEN COLLEGE STUDY THE NEW YORK

01:37:49.430 --> 01:37:52.734 region:rollup2
STATE. BUT IT BUT REMEDIAL

01:37:50.998 --> 01:37:54.235 region:rollup2
EDUCATION IS A HUGE PROBLEM BUT

01:37:52.734 --> 01:37:55.703 region:rollup2
STUDENTS ALSO FACE A LOT OF

01:37:54.235 --> 01:37:57.905 region:rollup2
OTHER PROBLEMS AND AND FINANCIAL

01:37:55.703 --> 01:38:00.108 region:rollup2
THE FINANCIAL SIDE OF COLLEGE

01:37:57.905 --> 01:38:01.442 region:rollup2
CAN'T BE. UNDERESTIMATED.

01:38:00.108 --> 01:38:03.611 region:rollup2
AND SOME OF THE STUDIES YOU'VE

01:38:01.442 --> 01:38:05.580 region:rollup2
DONE HAVE BEEN AND AND.

01:38:03.611 --> 01:38:07.315 region:rollup2
SMALLER STATES IN CALIFORNIA.

01:38:05.580 --> 01:38:08.015 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT POPULATIONS A YOU

01:38:07.315 --> 01:38:10.485 region:rollup2
MENTIONED OHIO.

01:38:08.015 --> 01:38:12.820 region:rollup2
.

01:38:10.485 --> 01:38:13.888 region:rollup2
HOW WELL DO YOU THINK THAT THE?

01:38:12.820 --> 01:38:15.423 region:rollup2
STUDIES YOU'VE DONE OF THE

01:38:13.888 --> 01:38:17.191 region:rollup2
MODELS THAT YOU LOOKED AT ARE

01:38:15.423 --> 01:38:19.026 region:rollup2
APPLICABLE TO AYE CALIFORNIA AND

01:38:17.191 --> 01:38:20.595 region:rollup2
CAN THEY BE SUCCESSFUL. IN

01:38:19.026 --> 01:38:22.130 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA. THAT THAT'S A VERY

01:38:20.595 --> 01:38:24.265 region:rollup2
GOOD QUESTION IT WE WE

01:38:22.130 --> 01:38:25.199 region:rollup2
PREDOMINATELY LOOK FOR PROGRAMS

01:38:24.265 --> 01:38:26.601 region:rollup2
THAT ARE SERVING LOW INCOME

01:38:25.199 --> 01:38:29.036 region:rollup2
POPULATIONS AND WE'RE VERY

01:38:26.601 --> 01:38:30.671 region:rollup2
FOCUSED ON. STUDENTS OF MINORITY

01:38:29.036 --> 01:38:32.373 region:rollup2
STUDENTS AS WELL. THAT THE

01:38:30.671 --> 01:38:34.275 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS THAT WE'VE STUDIED OUR

01:38:32.373 --> 01:38:36.010 region:rollup2
GENERAL APPROACH IS AFTER WE

01:38:34.275 --> 01:38:37.278 region:rollup2
FOUND A PROGRAM THAT'S EFFECTIVE

01:38:36.010 --> 01:38:39.280 region:rollup2
WHICH I DETEST THAT AGAIN IN

01:38:37.278 --> 01:38:40.448 region:rollup2
MULTIPLE CONTEXT AND SO THE IDEA

01:38:39.280 --> 01:38:42.283 region:rollup2
THE A STEP PROGRAM THAT I

01:38:40.448 --> 01:38:43.985 region:rollup2
MENTIONED STARTED IN NEW YORK.

01:38:42.283 --> 01:38:45.520 region:rollup2
WE TESTED IN OHIO AND AND

01:38:43.985 --> 01:38:47.255 region:rollup2
THERE'S NOW PROGRAM THAT'S

01:38:45.520 --> 01:38:49.190 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY GOING ON IN CALIFORNIA.

01:38:47.255 --> 01:38:50.224 region:rollup2
AT SKYLAND COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND

01:38:49.190 --> 01:38:52.326 region:rollup2
SEVERAL OF OUR OTHER PROGRAMS

01:38:50.224 --> 01:38:54.195 region:rollup2
WE'VE TESTED THESE AND MULTIPLE

01:38:52.326 --> 01:38:55.229 region:rollup2
LOCATIONS AROUND THE COUNTRY.

01:38:54.195 --> 01:38:56.697 region:rollup2
AND SO THE EVIDENCE SPACES

01:38:55.229 --> 01:38:58.266 region:rollup2
BUILDING I THINK A LOT OF THE

01:38:56.697 --> 01:39:00.501 region:rollup2
LESSONS THAT COME OUT OF THE

01:38:58.266 --> 01:39:02.170 region:rollup2
STUDIES ARE APPLICABLE TO

01:39:00.501 --> 01:39:03.905 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

01:39:02.170 --> 01:39:05.773 region:rollup2
AND AND AND AS I ASKED ABOUT THE

01:39:03.905 --> 01:39:06.741 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES YOU KNOW I AS A

01:39:05.773 --> 01:39:08.709 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY COLLEGE TRUSTEE.

01:39:06.741 --> 01:39:11.412 region:rollup2
.

01:39:08.709 --> 01:39:12.914 region:rollup2
AS A COMMUNICATIVE JE INSTRUCTOR

01:39:11.412 --> 01:39:14.048 region:rollup2
I I THINK ONE OF THE CHALLENGES

01:39:12.914 --> 01:39:16.150 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY AT THE COMMUNITY

01:39:14.048 --> 01:39:17.385 region:rollup2
COLLEGE LEVEL IS THAT STUDENTS

01:39:16.150 --> 01:39:18.886 region:rollup2
CANNOT OR OR NOT. FULL TIME

01:39:17.385 --> 01:39:20.688 region:rollup2
STUDENT

01:39:18.886 --> 01:39:22.256 region:rollup2
YOU NO I A THINK AT THE TIME

01:39:20.688 --> 01:39:24.058 region:rollup2
WHEN I WAS A STUDENT IN THE.

01:39:22.256 --> 01:39:25.893 region:rollup2
EARLY NINETEEN SEVENTIES WE WERE

01:39:24.058 --> 01:39:28.129 region:rollup2
ALL FULL TIME AND THE ONLY THING

01:39:25.893 --> 01:39:28.763 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAD TO WORRY ABOUT. WAS

01:39:28.129 --> 01:39:35.503 region:rollup2
GOING TO SCHOOL GOING TO BUT NOW

01:39:28.763 --> 01:39:38.239 region:rollup2
WE'RE SEEING STUDENTS

01:39:35.503 --> 01:39:39.407 region:rollup2
WITH JOBS. PERHAPS MULTIPLE JOBS

01:39:38.239 --> 01:39:42.510 region:rollup2
FACE SEEN.

01:39:39.407 --> 01:39:43.077 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES AND KNOW WHAT IF

01:39:42.510 --> 01:39:44.378 region:rollup2
THEY GONNA HAVE FOR DINNER.

01:39:43.077 --> 01:39:46.013 region:rollup2
.

01:39:44.378 --> 01:39:47.849 region:rollup2
SO THAT THE THE CHALLENGE OF

01:39:46.013 --> 01:39:50.017 region:rollup2
BEING FULL TIME I THINK IS

01:39:47.849 --> 01:39:52.587 region:rollup2
CRUCIAL. AND ANY STEPS THAT WE

01:39:50.017 --> 01:39:53.788 region:rollup2
CAN TAKE. AS WE DID LAST YEAR IN

01:39:52.587 --> 01:39:55.156 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATURE. OF WOULD

01:39:53.788 --> 01:39:55.756 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS

01:39:55.156 --> 01:39:57.124 region:rollup2
SAYING THAT IF YOU'RE A FULL

01:39:55.756 --> 01:39:58.493 region:rollup2
TIME STUDENT WILL TAKE CARE OF

01:39:57.124 --> 01:40:00.394 region:rollup2
YOUR.

01:39:58.493 --> 01:40:01.896 region:rollup2
FEES I THINK IS A STEP IN THE

01:40:00.394 --> 01:40:04.465 region:rollup2
RIGHT DIRECTION.

01:40:01.896 --> 01:40:05.333 region:rollup2
SKY.

01:40:04.465 --> 01:40:06.801 region:rollup2
I THANKS VERY MUCH FOR YOUR

01:40:05.333 --> 01:40:07.969 region:rollup2
TESTIMONY SO I I THINK THE

01:40:06.801 --> 01:40:09.804 region:rollup2
RESULTS ARE REALLY INTRIGUING.

01:40:07.969 --> 01:40:11.339 region:rollup2
AND WHAT I'VE HEARD ABOUT THE

01:40:09.804 --> 01:40:13.474 region:rollup2
SUCCESS OF SIMILAR PROGRAMS YOU

01:40:11.339 --> 01:40:15.376 region:rollup2
KNOW I USUALLY HERE WHILE WE DO

01:40:13.474 --> 01:40:17.545 region:rollup2
THESE TEN THINGS AND IT LEADS TO

01:40:15.376 --> 01:40:18.846 region:rollup2
THIS. LEVEL OF IMPROVEMENT AND

01:40:17.545 --> 01:40:20.047 region:rollup2
OUT COMES AND IT DO YOU HAVE ANY

01:40:18.846 --> 01:40:21.983 region:rollup2
SORT OF MORE FINELY GRAINED

01:40:20.047 --> 01:40:23.551 region:rollup2
ANALYSIS OF EXACTLY WHY IT IS

01:40:21.983 --> 01:40:24.418 region:rollup2
THESE PROGRAMS ARE WORKING OTHER

01:40:23.551 --> 01:40:25.887 region:rollup2
SOME.

01:40:24.418 --> 01:40:27.288 region:rollup2
PORTS THAT SEEM TO BE.

01:40:25.887 --> 01:40:28.089 region:rollup2
MORE IMPORTANT THAN OTHERS IS

01:40:27.288 --> 01:40:29.357 region:rollup2
THERE SOMETHING ABOUT THE

01:40:28.089 --> 01:40:31.092 region:rollup2
COMPREHENSIVE NATURE OF THE

01:40:29.357 --> 01:40:32.093 region:rollup2
SUPPORT SYSTEM SUCH THAT THAT

01:40:31.092 --> 01:40:33.794 region:rollup2
THE WHOLE IS GREATER THAN THE

01:40:32.093 --> 01:40:35.396 region:rollup2
SUM OF ITS PARTS I MEAN. OUT

01:40:33.794 --> 01:40:36.397 region:rollup2
WHAT WHAT CAN WE EXTRACT FROM

01:40:35.396 --> 01:40:38.499 region:rollup2
THIS AS FAR AS WHAT MOST

01:40:36.397 --> 01:40:39.800 region:rollup2
VALUABLE THAT THAT THAT'S A VERY

01:40:38.499 --> 01:40:40.635 region:rollup2
GOOD QUESTION AND IT'S IN OUT

01:40:39.800 --> 01:40:42.336 region:rollup2
THAT'S ONE OF THE REAL

01:40:40.635 --> 01:40:43.538 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES WE FACE BECAUSE IT'S

01:40:42.336 --> 01:40:45.172 region:rollup2
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT THE KEYS OUT

01:40:43.538 --> 01:40:47.608 region:rollup2
WHAT'S MOST IMPORTANT. BUT WE DO

01:40:45.172 --> 01:40:49.076 region:rollup2
TALK TO STUDENTS WE DO SURVEYS

01:40:47.608 --> 01:40:49.911 region:rollup2
WITH STUDENTS WE TRY TO GET OUT

01:40:49.076 --> 01:40:51.045 region:rollup2
THIS IN DIFFERENT WAYS AND WERE

01:40:49.911 --> 01:40:52.346 region:rollup2
ALSO. CONSTANTLY TRYING TO

01:40:51.045 --> 01:40:54.348 region:rollup2
FIGURE OUT HOW TO LOWER THE COST

01:40:52.346 --> 01:40:55.983 region:rollup2
OF THESE PROGRAMS SO WE FIGURED

01:40:54.348 --> 01:40:57.385 region:rollup2
OUT NOW HOW TO DEVELOP WE HAVE A

01:40:55.983 --> 01:40:58.352 region:rollup2
COST TOOL THAT WE CAN START TO

01:40:57.385 --> 01:40:59.954 region:rollup2
SEE IF WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A

01:40:58.352 --> 01:41:01.923 region:rollup2
PROGRAM LIKE. WHAT WE'RE DOING

01:40:59.954 --> 01:41:03.624 region:rollup2
IN DETROIT FOR EXAMPLE TO A NEW

01:41:01.923 --> 01:41:05.626 region:rollup2
AREA WE CAN START TO PRICE OUT

01:41:03.624 --> 01:41:06.961 region:rollup2
WHAT EACH COMPONENT WILL COST

01:41:05.626 --> 01:41:09.196 region:rollup2
AND THINK ABOUT THE PACKAGE AS A

01:41:06.961 --> 01:41:10.131 region:rollup2
WHOLE? BUT THERE ARE SOME THAT

01:41:09.196 --> 01:41:11.032 region:rollup2
IT'S A VERY GOOD QUESTION

01:41:10.131 --> 01:41:12.967 region:rollup2
THERE'S SOME GENERAL PRINCIPLES

01:41:11.032 --> 01:41:13.901 region:rollup2
LIKE THAT COME OUT AND I THINK

01:41:12.967 --> 01:41:16.037 region:rollup2
ONE OF THEM IS JUST THE

01:41:13.901 --> 01:41:18.973 region:rollup2
IMPORTANCE OF HIGH TOUCH

01:41:16.037 --> 01:41:21.342 region:rollup2
ADVISING THIS GOES TO AND WHAT

01:41:18.973 --> 01:41:23.411 region:rollup2
CHAIR MEDINA. MENTIONED ABOUT

01:41:21.342 --> 01:41:25.613 region:rollup2
STUDENTS WHO ARE PART TIME AND

01:41:23.411 --> 01:41:26.914 region:rollup2
FACING YOU KNOW MANY CHALLENGES

01:41:25.613 --> 01:41:28.716 region:rollup2
AN ADVISER CAN BE SOMEONE WHO

01:41:26.914 --> 01:41:31.118 region:rollup2
CAN HELP NAVIGATE THOSE KIND OF

01:41:28.716 --> 01:41:34.288 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES. BUT GETTING STUDENTS

01:41:31.118 --> 01:41:36.357 region:rollup2
TO ENGAGE WITH ADVISERS HAVING

01:41:34.288 --> 01:41:38.292 region:rollup2
ADVISORS HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO

01:41:36.357 --> 01:41:40.394 region:rollup2
TALK WITH STUDENTS IS A REAL

01:41:38.292 --> 01:41:44.765 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES AND SO WHAT WE'VE

01:41:40.394 --> 01:41:47.568 region:rollup2
DONE IN MANY CASES AND WHAT WE

01:41:44.765 --> 01:41:49.670 region:rollup2
STUDY TO PLACES LIKE UNITS THAT.

01:41:47.568 --> 01:41:52.673 region:rollup2
ARE WAYS TO ENCOURAGE STUDENTS

01:41:49.670 --> 01:41:56.310 region:rollup2
TO TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THOSE

01:41:52.673 --> 01:41:59.046 region:rollup2
SERVICES THAT WE KNOW CAN HELP

01:41:56.310 --> 01:42:01.215 region:rollup2

EXAMPLE METROCARD. IS A VERY

01:42:06.087 --> 01:42:09.757 region:rollup2
VALUABLE THING TO A STUDENT

WANTED TO MAKE IS THAT MY

01:44:09.143 --> 01:44:11.912 region:rollup2
COLLEAGUE PAMELA IS GONNA SPEAK

01:44:10.177 --> 01:44:13.781 region:rollup2

INCREASES IN GRADUATION RATES.

01:44:13.781 --> 01:44:17.518 region:rollup2

01:44:31.332 --> 01:44:34.835 region:rollup2
THAT AT LEAST TWO POINT FIVE TO

01:44:33.167 --> 01:44:36.771 region:rollup2
THREE BILLION IN CAPITAL

01:44:34.835 --> 01:44:38.506 region:rollup2

SPECIFICALLY AT THE PP I SEE

01:47:14.628 --> 01:47:17.097 region:rollup2
CHALLENGE. A UC CHANCELLORS ARE

01:47:15.930 --> 01:47:18.899 region:rollup2
TAKING A LOOK AT WHAT THEY MIGHT

01:47:17.097 --> 01:47:21.068 region:rollup2
BE ABLE TO DO TO ADDRESS THE

01:47:18.899 --> 01:47:21.735 region:rollup2
DEGREE GAP THAT. IS BEFORE US

01:47:21.068 --> 01:47:23.170 region:rollup2
AND OF WHAT WE'RE SEEING EARLY

01:47:21.735 --> 01:47:25.039 region:rollup2
ON IS THAT THE STRATEGIES THAT

01:47:23.170 --> 01:47:26.640 region:rollup2
CAMPUSES MAY TAKE MAY VERY.

01:47:25.039 --> 01:47:27.141 region:rollup2
IN SOME CASES SOME CAMPUSES ARE

01:47:26.640 --> 01:47:28.142 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE LOOKING AT

01:47:27.141 --> 01:47:29.944 region:rollup2
ESTABLISHING PARTNERSHIPS WITH.

01:47:28.142 --> 01:47:31.745 region:rollup2
LOCAL UNIVERSITIES OR COLLEGES A

01:47:29.944 --> 01:47:33.180 region:rollup2
IN THAT AREA THEY MAY BE LOOKING

01:47:31.745 --> 01:47:35.182 region:rollup2
AT INCREASING OFF CAMPUS

01:47:33.180 --> 01:47:37.885 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATION IN INTERNSHIP

01:47:35.182 --> 01:47:39.653 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS LIKE YOU SEE DC OR ON

01:47:37.885 --> 01:47:41.755 region:rollup2
YOU SEE SACRAMENTO'S CENTER OR A

01:47:39.653 --> 01:47:44.058 region:rollup2
EDUCATION ABROAD. AS A WAY TO

01:47:41.755 --> 01:47:45.693 region:rollup2
INCREASE ENROLLMENT AND ACCESS

01:47:44.058 --> 01:47:46.760 region:rollup2
OF BUT ALSO TO MINIMIZE THE

01:47:45.693 --> 01:47:48.362 region:rollup2
AMOUNT OF CAPITAL COSTS THAT

01:47:46.760 --> 01:47:49.897 region:rollup2
WOULD BE NEEDED TO IT TO MANAGE

01:47:48.362 --> 01:47:51.899 region:rollup2
THAT. OTHERS ARE GONNA BE

01:47:49.897 --> 01:47:53.667 region:rollup2
PRIORITIZING EFFORTS TO INCREASE

01:47:51.899 --> 01:47:58.105 region:rollup2
DEGREE PRODUCTION AND THAT'S

01:47:53.667 --> 01:47:59.039 region:rollup2
IMPROVING GRADUATION RATES.

01:47:58.105 --> 01:47:59.573 region:rollup2
REDUCING TIME TO DEGREE.

01:47:59.039 --> 01:48:00.808 region:rollup2
IN SOME CASES IT MAY BE

01:47:59.573 --> 01:48:02.176 region:rollup2
PROVIDING INCENTIVES FOR

01:48:00.808 --> 01:48:04.078 region:rollup2
STUDENTS TO BE ABLE TO GRADUATE

01:48:02.176 --> 01:48:05.946 region:rollup2
IN THREE YEARS. SO WHATEVER THE

01:48:04.078 --> 01:48:07.848 region:rollup2
CAMPUS STRATEGY IS THE OVERALL

01:48:05.946 --> 01:48:09.483 region:rollup2
GOAL IS THE SAME TO INCREASE THE

01:48:07.848 --> 01:48:11.251 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF DEGREES THAT WERE ABLE

01:48:09.483 --> 01:48:12.886 region:rollup2
TO PRODUCES A SYSTEM.

01:48:11.251 --> 01:48:14.755 region:rollup2
BUT TURNING TO THE REPORT THAT

01:48:12.886 --> 01:48:15.689 region:rollup2
WE PRODUCED IN THE SLIDES THAT

01:48:14.755 --> 01:48:17.691 region:rollup2
WE HAVE THERE THE FIRST ONE

01:48:15.689 --> 01:48:19.593 region:rollup2
THERE. IS THE PROPOSAL FOR WHAT

01:48:17.691 --> 01:48:20.761 region:rollup2
IT WOULD TAKE TO ACHIEVE TWO

01:48:19.593 --> 01:48:22.896 region:rollup2
HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND.

01:48:20.761 --> 01:48:24.098 region:rollup2
BACHELOR'S DEGREES THIS IS THE

01:48:22.896 --> 01:48:25.132 region:rollup2
SAME ONE THAT WAS IN THE YOUR

01:48:24.098 --> 01:48:27.067 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE REPORT.

01:48:25.132 --> 01:48:28.869 region:rollup2
IT SHOWS THAT THE ANNUAL

01:48:27.067 --> 01:48:30.104 region:rollup2
ENROLLMENT GROWTH THAT WE HAVE A

01:48:28.869 --> 01:48:32.239 region:rollup2
GO FROM WHAT WE HAVE TODAY ABOUT

01:48:30.104 --> 01:48:33.474 region:rollup2
ONE PERCENT. UP TO ALMOST FIVE

01:48:32.239 --> 01:48:35.609 region:rollup2
PERCENT OVER AN EIGHT YEAR

01:48:33.474 --> 01:48:37.277 region:rollup2
PERIOD THAT TRANSLATES TO ANNUAL

01:48:35.609 --> 01:48:39.713 region:rollup2
GROWTH OF ABOUT TEN THOUSAND TO

01:48:37.277 --> 01:48:41.382 region:rollup2
OVER THIRTEEN THOUSAND A YEAR.

01:48:39.713 --> 01:48:43.117 region:rollup2
IT REPRESENTS NOT ONLY

01:48:41.382 --> 01:48:44.118 region:rollup2
UNPRECEDENTED GROWTH FOR THE

01:48:43.117 --> 01:48:45.486 region:rollup2
UNIVERSITY BUT IT ALSO A

01:48:44.118 --> 01:48:46.720 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF STATE

01:48:45.486 --> 01:48:49.156 region:rollup2
RESOURCES.

01:48:46.720 --> 01:48:50.491 region:rollup2
IF WE ESTIMATE THAT ONE AT TEN

01:48:49.156 --> 01:48:52.559 region:rollup2
THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR EACH

01:48:50.491 --> 01:48:54.128 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL STUDENT IN THE OUT

01:48:52.559 --> 01:48:55.963 region:rollup2
YEARS THAT WORKS OUT TO BE A ONE

01:48:54.128 --> 01:48:57.464 region:rollup2
BILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR. ADJUST

01:48:55.963 --> 01:48:58.265 region:rollup2
FOR ENROLLMENT FUNDING IF WE

01:48:57.464 --> 01:48:59.666 region:rollup2
TOOK A LOOK AT WHAT OUR

01:48:58.265 --> 01:49:01.468 region:rollup2
ESTIMATES ARE FOR CAL GRANT

01:48:59.666 --> 01:49:03.404 region:rollup2
SUPPORT. THAT'S AN ADDITIONAL

01:49:01.468 --> 01:49:04.838 region:rollup2
FOUR HUNDRED SIXTY MILLION AND

01:49:03.404 --> 01:49:06.340 region:rollup2
THEN KIERAN ALSO TALKED ABOUT

01:49:04.838 --> 01:49:08.509 region:rollup2
THE CAPITAL COSTS THAT WE'VE

01:49:06.340 --> 01:49:10.944 region:rollup2
ESTIMATED ASSOCIATED WITH IT SO

01:49:08.509 --> 01:49:12.679 region:rollup2
TWO POINT FIVE TO. THREE BILLION

01:49:10.944 --> 01:49:14.448 region:rollup2
AN ADDITIONAL CAPITAL OUTLAY AND

01:49:12.679 --> 01:49:16.984 region:rollup2
THAT'S ON TOP OF FIVE POINT SIX

01:49:14.448 --> 01:49:19.953 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAVE ESTIMATED. AS NEED.

01:49:16.984 --> 01:49:21.021 region:rollup2
FOR THE NEXT FIVE TO TEN YEARS.

01:49:19.953 --> 01:49:24.658 region:rollup2
ANOTHER POINT THAT WE'D LIKE TO

01:49:21.021 --> 01:49:26.660 region:rollup2
pMAGNITUDE FOR OF THE UNIVERSITY

01:49:24.658 --> 01:49:28.362 region:rollup2
OF CALIFORNIA WOULD MAKE IT MORE

01:49:26.660 --> 01:49:29.897 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT FOR A CALIFORNIA STATE

01:49:28.362 --> 01:49:32.099 region:rollup2
UNIVERSITY COLLEAGUES TO BE ABLE

01:49:29.897 --> 01:49:33.700 region:rollup2
TO ACHIEVE THEIR PP I SEE GOALS.

01:49:32.099 --> 01:49:36.203 region:rollup2
OF INCREASING THEIR ENROLLMENT

01:49:33.700 --> 01:49:37.905 region:rollup2
BY IT DEGREES AWARDED BY AROUND

01:49:36.203 --> 01:49:39.907 region:rollup2
FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND. OF WE'D

01:49:37.905 --> 01:49:40.841 region:rollup2
BE TAKING A LARGER PROPORTION OF

01:49:39.907 --> 01:49:42.309 region:rollup2
THE CALIFORNIA HIGH SCHOOL

01:49:40.841 --> 01:49:43.977 region:rollup2
GRADUATES IN COMMUNITY COLLEGE

01:49:42.309 --> 01:49:46.280 region:rollup2
TRANSFERS. THAT WOULD

01:49:43.977 --> 01:49:47.881 region:rollup2
TRADITIONALLY GO TO YOU SEE.

01:49:46.280 --> 01:49:50.951 region:rollup2
AND IT WOULD ALSO HAVE AN

01:49:47.881 --> 01:49:52.786 region:rollup2
EFFECT ON THE IMPROVEMENTS THAT

01:49:50.951 --> 01:49:56.023 region:rollup2
WOULD NEED TO BE MADE ON THEIR

01:49:52.786 --> 01:49:58.625 region:rollup2
GRADUATION RATES WE RAISE THIS

01:49:56.023 --> 01:50:02.062 region:rollup2
TO YOU BECAUSE WE BELIEVE AS YOU

01:49:58.625 --> 01:50:03.864 region:rollup2
DO. THAT PUBLIC EDUCATION HIGHER

01:50:02.062 --> 01:50:05.699 region:rollup2
HIGHER EDUCATION SEGMENTS AND

01:50:03.864 --> 01:50:07.868 region:rollup2
THE INDEPENDENT COLLEGES AND

01:50:05.699 --> 01:50:09.703 region:rollup2
UNIVERSITIES ARE ALL GOING TO

01:50:07.868 --> 01:50:11.839 region:rollup2
NEED TO COLLABORATE AND

01:50:09.703 --> 01:50:14.875 region:rollup2
COORDINATE. TO ENSURE THAT

01:50:11.839 --> 01:50:17.478 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA CAN MAKE PROGRESS IN

01:50:14.875 --> 01:50:20.247 region:rollup2
A CLOSING THIS DEGREE GAP AND

01:50:17.478 --> 01:50:21.515 region:rollup2
MEETING THE STATE'S FUTURE

01:50:20.247 --> 01:50:22.916 region:rollup2
WORKFORCE NEEDS.

01:50:21.515 --> 01:50:23.550 region:rollup2
THERE'S ANOTHER A COMPONENT I

01:50:22.916 --> 01:50:24.618 region:rollup2
DON'T WANNA LOSE SIGHT OF AND

01:50:23.550 --> 01:50:25.452 region:rollup2
THAT'S THE STUDENTS THEMSELVES.

01:50:24.618 --> 01:50:26.553 region:rollup2
A IF WE CONTINUE TO GROW

01:50:25.452 --> 01:50:27.588 region:rollup2
UNDERGRADUATE DEGREES WE NEED TO

01:50:26.553 --> 01:50:28.288 region:rollup2
ALSO INCREASE THE OPPORTUNITIES

01:50:27.588 --> 01:50:29.490 region:rollup2
FOR THE STUDENTS TO GET GRADUATE

01:50:28.288 --> 01:50:30.457 region:rollup2
DEGREES. AND IF WE TAKE A LOOK

01:50:29.490 --> 01:50:31.725 region:rollup2
AT THE SECOND SLIDE THIS PRESENT

01:50:30.457 --> 01:50:34.161 region:rollup2
SOME INFORMATION THAT WE'VE A

01:50:31.725 --> 01:50:35.429 region:rollup2
HAVE ON. AT THE PLANS AND THE

01:50:34.161 --> 01:50:36.463 region:rollup2
ACTUAL IS FOR I'M STUDENTS

01:50:35.429 --> 01:50:37.131 region:rollup2
GETTING GRADUATE DEGREES. OF OUR

01:50:36.463 --> 01:50:38.232 region:rollup2
RESEARCH SHOWS THAT AROUND FORTY

PRESCRIBED PAIN KILLERS.

01:52:09.289 --> 01:52:12.559 region:rollup2
BUT TO HELP HEALTH SYSTEMS CUT

01:52:10.791 --> 01:52:15.195 region:rollup2
DOWN ON A NEEDED OPIOID

01:52:12.559 --> 01:52:16.930 region:rollup2
PRESCRIPTIONS AND FLAG THOSE AT

01:52:15.195 --> 01:52:18.799 region:rollup2
RISK OF OPIOID ADDICTION. THOSE

01:52:16.930 --> 01:52:20.200 region:rollup2
ARE JUST TWO EXAMPLES OF THE

01:52:18.799 --> 01:52:22.102 region:rollup2
CONTRIBUTIONS THAT GRADUATE

01:52:20.200 --> 01:52:23.303 region:rollup2
STUDENTS ARE MAKING AND I MARCH

01:52:22.102 --> 01:52:24.972 region:rollup2
TWENTY FIRST YOU'LL HOPEFULLY

01:52:23.303 --> 01:52:26.239 region:rollup2
HERE FOR MORE DURING ARE YOU SEE

01:52:24.972 --> 01:52:28.275 region:rollup2
GRADUATE RESEARCH STAY THE IN

01:52:26.239 --> 01:52:29.710 region:rollup2
THE CAPITAL.

01:52:28.275 --> 01:52:31.678 region:rollup2
WE PRODUCED AN ALTERNATE

01:52:29.710 --> 01:52:33.313 region:rollup2
SCENARIO THAT WOULD BE MORE COST

01:52:31.678 --> 01:52:35.449 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVE AND COLLABORATIVE AND

01:52:33.313 --> 01:52:36.650 region:rollup2
STILL WOULD ENSURE THE STRENGTH

01:52:35.449 --> 01:52:37.851 region:rollup2
OF CALIFORNIANS WORKFORCE AND

01:52:36.650 --> 01:52:39.853 region:rollup2
THE STATE'S KNOWLEDGE BASED

01:52:37.851 --> 01:52:41.655 region:rollup2
ECONOMY. IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT

01:52:39.853 --> 01:52:43.156 region:rollup2
SLIDE THREE. THIS SHOWS A

01:52:41.655 --> 01:52:45.158 region:rollup2
HEALTHY BUT MORE MODEST

01:52:43.156 --> 01:52:46.860 region:rollup2
ENROLLMENT GROWTH JUST OVER ONE

01:52:45.158 --> 01:52:48.629 region:rollup2
PERCENT A YEAR OR AN ANNUAL

01:52:46.860 --> 01:52:50.397 region:rollup2
INCREASE OF TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED

01:52:48.629 --> 01:52:51.965 region:rollup2
UNDERGRADUATES AND NINE HUNDRED

01:52:50.397 --> 01:52:54.101 region:rollup2
GRADUATE STUDENTS BETWEEN NOW.

01:52:51.965 --> 01:52:55.736 region:rollup2
AND TWENTY THIRTY.

01:52:54.101 --> 01:52:57.671 region:rollup2
OUR INITIAL STE OTHER ESTIMATES

01:52:55.736 --> 01:52:58.739 region:rollup2
SHOW IF YOU JUST DID THAT THAT

01:52:57.671 --> 01:53:00.374 region:rollup2
WOULD INCREASE THE DEGREE

01:52:58.739 --> 01:53:02.275 region:rollup2
PRODUCTION BY A HUNDRED AND

01:53:00.374 --> 01:53:04.111 region:rollup2
FIFTY THOUSAND FOR THE STATE.

01:53:02.275 --> 01:53:05.312 region:rollup2
THAT'S A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE

01:53:04.111 --> 01:53:06.880 region:rollup2
THOUSAND BACHELOR'S DEGREES

01:53:05.312 --> 01:53:08.682 region:rollup2
TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND GRADUATE

01:53:06.880 --> 01:53:10.617 region:rollup2
DEGREES AND WE BELIEVE THAT WE

01:53:08.682 --> 01:53:12.452 region:rollup2
CAN MAKE UP SOME OF THAT PORTION

01:53:10.617 --> 01:53:13.720 region:rollup2
OF THE BALANCE BY HIM WITH THE

01:53:12.452 --> 01:53:14.821 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE SUPPORT.

01:53:13.720 --> 01:53:16.590 region:rollup2
FURTHER INCREASE OUR GRADUATION

EIGHT PERCENT FOR TRANSFER

01:53:24.064 --> 01:53:27.534 region:rollup2
STUDENTS THAT'S SLIGHTLY HIGHER

01:53:26.033 --> 01:53:29.770 region:rollup2
THAN ONE PP I SEE DID THE

01:53:27.534 --> 01:53:31.305 region:rollup2
ORIGINAL REPORT. OVER THE DECADE

01:53:29.770 --> 01:53:33.440 region:rollup2
WE'VE SEEN GREATER IMPROVEMENTS

01:53:31.305 --> 01:53:35.075 region:rollup2
WITH A ARE YOU SEE FOUR YEAR

01:53:33.440 --> 01:53:36.677 region:rollup2
GRADUATION RATE FOR FRESHMAN.

01:53:35.075 --> 01:53:38.979 region:rollup2
THAT'S GONE UP EIGHT POINTS FROM

01:53:36.677 --> 01:53:40.580 region:rollup2
FIFTY SIX TO SIXTY FOUR PERCENT

01:53:38.979 --> 01:53:42.082 region:rollup2
AND THE TRANSFER TO RATE IT TO

01:53:40.580 --> 01:53:43.350 region:rollup2
YOUR RATE HAS GONE UP FIVE

01:53:42.082 --> 01:53:44.985 region:rollup2
POINTS FROM FIFTY ONE TO FIFTY

SIX.

01:53:44.985 --> 01:53:48.055 region:rollup2
WE WORK CLOSELY WITH OUR

01:53:46.119 --> 01:53:49.189 region:rollup2
CAMPUSES TO SHARE RESEARCH AND

01:53:48.055 --> 01:53:50.624 region:rollup2
LEARN FROM THEIR PROGRAMS AND

01:53:49.189 --> 01:53:52.492 region:rollup2
STRATEGIES THAT THEY HAVE IN

01:53:50.624 --> 01:53:54.027 region:rollup2
PLACE TO IMPROVE UNDERGRADUATE

SHIRTS SO THAT THEY CAN IDENTIFY

01:54:10.477 --> 01:54:13.814 region:rollup2
THEMSELVES. AND THAT PROVIDES A

01:54:12.279 --> 01:54:15.148 region:rollup2
WAY FOR THEM TO KNOW THAT THERE

01:54:13.814 --> 01:54:16.183 region:rollup2
WERE OTHERS THAT THEY CAN TURN

01:54:15.148 --> 01:54:18.385 region:rollup2
TO THAT MAY HAVE HAD SIMILAR

01:54:16.183 --> 01:54:20.153 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCES. THEY ALSO SERVE AS

01:54:18.385 --> 01:54:21.855 region:rollup2
MENTORS ON THE CAMPUS THAT

01:54:20.153 --> 01:54:23.323 region:rollup2
PROGRAM WAS EXPANDED TO OTHER

01:54:21.855 --> 01:54:25.659 region:rollup2

TRYING TO POTENTIALLY REDUCE

01:55:32.325 --> 01:55:35.695 region:rollup2
TIME TO CREATE. IF WE WERE ABLE

01:55:34.694 --> 01:55:37.631 region:rollup2
TO MEET PEOPLE YEAH SEIZE GOAL

01:55:35.695 --> 01:55:39.666 region:rollup2
OF NINETY TWO PERCENT OF A

01:55:37.631 --> 01:55:40.734 region:rollup2
GRADUATION RATE. THAT WOULD ADD

01:55:39.666 --> 01:55:42.469 region:rollup2
POTENTIALLY ANOTHER FIFTY

01:55:40.734 --> 01:55:43.737 region:rollup2
THOUSAND DEGREES BRINGING THAT

01:55:42.469 --> 01:55:47.440 region:rollup2

THE WORLD.

01:58:45.485 --> 01:58:49.055 region:rollup2
BUT OF COURSE YOU SEE DAVIS'S

01:58:46.486 --> 01:58:49.789 region:rollup2
IS MUCH MORE.

01:58:49.055 --> 01:58:51.191 region:rollup2
THIS HALLWAY AND ROLLED OVER

01:58:49.789 --> 01:58:52.959 region:rollup2
THIRTY EIGHT THOUSAND STUDENTS

PROFESSIONAL SCHOOLS.

01:59:04.471 --> 01:59:08.074 region:rollup2
AS IS THE CASE FOR ALL OF OUR

01:59:06.039 --> 01:59:09.909 region:rollup2
CAMPUSES WE'VE HAD A TREMENDOUS

01:59:08.074 --> 01:59:11.678 region:rollup2
PERIOD OF GROWTH LAST TEN YEARS

01:59:09.909 --> 01:59:12.979 region:rollup2
UC DAVIS IS IN ROWING TWENTY SIX

01:59:11.678 --> 01:59:14.748 region:rollup2
PERCENT MORE STUDENTS COMPARED

01:59:12.979 --> 01:59:16.216 region:rollup2
TO FALL TWO THOUSAND EIGHT JUST

01:59:14.748 --> 01:59:17.617 region:rollup2
TEN YEARS.

01:59:16.216 --> 01:59:19.886 region:rollup2
AND THAT GROWTH AND OUR CAMPUS

01:59:17.617 --> 01:59:21.855 region:rollup2
HAS BEEN GUIDED BY A TWENTY

01:59:19.886 --> 01:59:23.556 region:rollup2
TWENTY PLAN HOME WHERE IN

01:59:21.855 --> 01:59:24.891 region:rollup2
ADDITION TO GROWING CALIFORNIAN

01:59:23.556 --> 01:59:25.859 region:rollup2
ROMANS WE ALSO INCREASED

01:59:24.891 --> 01:59:27.560 region:rollup2
PROPORTIONATE NATIONAL

01:59:25.859 --> 01:59:29.696 region:rollup2
INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS.

01:59:27.560 --> 01:59:31.197 region:rollup2
BUT THAT PLAN HAD MANY GOALS BUT

01:59:29.696 --> 01:59:33.099 region:rollup2
PRIMARY AMONGST IT WAS OUR

01:59:31.197 --> 01:59:36.069 region:rollup2
ABILITY CREATING FUNDING TO

01:59:33.099 --> 01:59:37.604 region:rollup2
INVESTING CAPITAL.

01:59:36.069 --> 01:59:39.239 region:rollup2
AS WE TURN TO CAPITAL JUST A

01:59:37.604 --> 01:59:40.940 region:rollup2
BIT MORE.

01:59:39.239 --> 01:59:41.808 region:rollup2
CONTEXT FOR UC DAVIS

01:59:40.940 --> 01:59:43.143 region:rollup2
WE HAVE OVER FIFTY THREE HUNDRED

01:59:41.808 --> 01:59:44.244 region:rollup2
ACRES.

01:59:43.143 --> 01:59:45.812 region:rollup2
AND NEARLY TWELVE HUNDRED

01:59:44.244 --> 01:59:48.148 region:rollup2
BUILDINGS COMPRISING FOURTEEN

01:59:45.812 --> 01:59:49.849 region:rollup2
MILLION SQUARE FEET AND HUNDRED

01:59:48.148 --> 01:59:51.751 region:rollup2
THIRTY MILES OF INFRASTRUCTURE

01:59:49.849 --> 01:59:53.086 region:rollup2
THAT'S IN DAVIS IN ADDITION HERE

01:59:51.751 --> 01:59:54.587 region:rollup2
IN SACRAMENTO WE HAVE A HUNDRED

01:59:53.086 --> 01:59:56.222 region:rollup2
AND FORTY NINE ACRES WAS SEVENTY

01:59:54.587 --> 01:59:58.091 region:rollup2
BUILDINGS. AND WE HAVE

01:59:56.222 --> 01:59:59.659 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL FACILITIES THAT

01:59:58.091 --> 02:00:01.928 region:rollup2
SUPPORT TEACHING AND RESEARCH IN

01:59:59.659 --> 02:00:03.830 region:rollup2
PLACES LIKE BUT DEGARR TAHOE A

02:00:01.928 --> 02:00:05.365 region:rollup2
TO NAME A FEW.

02:00:03.830 --> 02:00:07.233 region:rollup2
SO IF WE IF WE THINK ABOUT

02:00:05.365 --> 02:00:08.935 region:rollup2
GROWTH I WANNA FIRST CONSIDER

02:00:07.233 --> 02:00:10.370 region:rollup2
CLASSROOMS THAT'S AN OBVIOUS IN

02:00:08.935 --> 02:00:12.038 region:rollup2
CRITICAL NEED FOR ACCOMMODATING

02:00:10.370 --> 02:00:13.239 region:rollup2
STUDENT GROWTH.

02:00:12.038 --> 02:00:14.607 region:rollup2
AND JUST TO INTRODUCE YOU TO OUR

02:00:13.239 --> 02:00:15.675 region:rollup2
BASE SCENARIO.

02:00:14.607 --> 02:00:17.277 region:rollup2
WE'RE IN THE MIDST OF A SIX YEAR

02:00:15.675 --> 02:00:18.745 region:rollup2
PROGRAM.

02:00:17.277 --> 02:00:21.214 region:rollup2
THAT'S RENOVATING OUR EXISTING

02:00:18.745 --> 02:00:22.582 region:rollup2
HUNDRED THIRTY CLASSROOMS.

02:00:21.214 --> 02:00:23.883 region:rollup2
WEARE INVESTING A TOTAL OF

02:00:22.582 --> 02:00:26.453 region:rollup2
TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS OVER

02:00:23.883 --> 02:00:28.054 region:rollup2
THE SIX YEARS TO DO FLOOR TO

02:00:26.453 --> 02:00:29.022 region:rollup2
CEILING RENOVATIONS TO IMPLODE

02:00:28.054 --> 02:00:30.623 region:rollup2
PROVE THE STUDENT LEARNING

02:00:29.022 --> 02:00:31.958 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE.

02:00:30.623 --> 02:00:33.059 region:rollup2
OTHERS THERE'S A COUPLE OF

02:00:34.561 --> 02:00:37.263 region:rollup2
WHEN WE GO IN AND DO THESE.

02:00:36.196 --> 02:00:38.765 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS WERE TAKING CARE OF

02:00:37.263 --> 02:00:39.933 region:rollup2
DEFERRED MAINTENANCE

02:00:38.765 --> 02:00:41.634 region:rollup2
FOR REPLACING OUTDATED

02:00:39.933 --> 02:00:44.604 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY WERE PROVIDING SOME

02:00:41.634 --> 02:00:46.606 region:rollup2
FLEXIBLE SEATING AND AND OTHER

02:00:44.604 --> 02:00:48.908 region:rollup2
ARRANGEMENTS TO SUPPORT. A

02:00:46.606 --> 02:00:51.144 region:rollup2
MODERN INSTRUCTION.

02:00:48.908 --> 02:00:52.479 region:rollup2
APPROACH FOR USING IS TAKING.

02:00:51.144 --> 02:00:54.581 region:rollup2
ABOUT EIGHT TO TWELVE

02:00:52.479 --> 02:00:56.116 region:rollup2
CLASSROOMS EACH SUMMER TO DO

02:00:54.581 --> 02:00:58.151 region:rollup2
THIS FULL RENOVATION AND IT'S

02:00:56.116 --> 02:00:59.753 region:rollup2
HAD EXCELLENT SUCCESS.

02:00:58.151 --> 02:01:02.589 region:rollup2
BUT WE NEED A MECHANISM TO

02:00:59.753 --> 02:01:04.190 region:rollup2
SUSTAIN IT.

02:01:02.589 --> 02:01:05.558 region:rollup2
IN ADDITION TO CARING FOR THE

02:01:04.190 --> 02:01:06.926 region:rollup2
EXISTING CLASSROOMS.

02:01:05.558 --> 02:01:09.562 region:rollup2
ENROLLMENT GROWTH CREATES THE

02:01:06.926 --> 02:01:11.264 region:rollup2
NEED FOR NEW SEATS.

02:01:09.562 --> 02:01:12.699 region:rollup2
AND TEACHING LABORATORIES AND IF

02:01:11.264 --> 02:01:15.135 region:rollup2
YOU'RE CAMPUS LIKE UC DAVIS

02:01:12.699 --> 02:01:16.569 region:rollup2
ANIMAL SCIENCE TEACHING.

02:01:15.135 --> 02:01:18.838 region:rollup2
SO WE'RE DELIVERING HERE TO WERE

02:01:16.569 --> 02:01:20.607 region:rollup2
ADDING OVER FOUR THOUSAND SEATS

02:01:18.838 --> 02:01:21.708 region:rollup2
AND SEVEN FACILITIES.

02:01:20.607 --> 02:01:23.743 region:rollup2
TO CATCH UP TO THE GROWTH WAS

02:01:21.708 --> 02:01:25.745 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCED AND TO SUPPORT MORE

02:01:23.743 --> 02:01:27.447 region:rollup2
INTERACTIVE TEACHING.

02:01:25.745 --> 02:01:28.948 region:rollup2
THE NEW BUILDINGS ARE REQUIRING

02:01:27.447 --> 02:01:30.917 region:rollup2
INVESTMENTS TOTALLING OVER A

02:01:28.948 --> 02:01:32.685 region:rollup2
HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION THAT'S

02:01:30.917 --> 02:01:33.553 region:rollup2
BEYOND THE RENOVATION PROGRAM.

02:01:32.685 --> 02:01:35.188 region:rollup2
SO THAT WE CAN MEET OUR TWENTY

02:01:33.553 --> 02:01:36.923 region:rollup2
TWENTY PLAN.

02:01:35.188 --> 02:01:39.058 region:rollup2
ANY ADDITIONAL GROWTH THAT

02:01:36.923 --> 02:01:41.494 region:rollup2
SUGGESTED BY THAT PP I SEE PLAN

02:01:39.058 --> 02:01:44.731 region:rollup2
WOULD REQUIRE SUBSTANTIAL.

02:01:41.494 --> 02:01:45.498 region:rollup2
INVESTMENT BEYOND THAT.

02:01:44.731 --> 02:01:47.066 region:rollup2
ANOTHER CATEGORY OF CRITICAL

02:01:45.498 --> 02:01:48.802 region:rollup2
NEED ARE LABORATORIES FOR

02:01:47.066 --> 02:01:50.203 region:rollup2
RESEARCH AND TEACHING.

02:01:48.802 --> 02:01:51.638 region:rollup2
SO CHAIRMAN OFFER CHEMISTRY AS A

02:01:50.203 --> 02:01:52.672 region:rollup2
CASE STUDY.

02:01:51.638 --> 02:01:55.008 region:rollup2
OR TOP RANKED RESEARCH

02:01:52.672 --> 02:01:56.075 region:rollup2
UNIVERSITY FIFTY SEVEN PERCENT

02:01:55.008 --> 02:01:58.678 region:rollup2
OF THE UNDERGRADUATES AT UC

02:01:56.075 --> 02:01:59.646 region:rollup2
DAVIS ARE IN STEM FIELDS.

02:01:58.678 --> 02:02:00.747 region:rollup2
AND THAT WERE LEADERS AND

02:01:59.646 --> 02:02:02.882 region:rollup2
DISCOVERY AND INNOVATION ACROSS

02:02:00.747 --> 02:02:04.350 region:rollup2
THE WORLD.

02:02:02.882 --> 02:02:06.519 region:rollup2
STEM OF COURSE REQUIRES

02:02:04.350 --> 02:02:08.154 region:rollup2
SPECIALIZED TEACHING FACILITIES.

02:02:06.519 --> 02:02:10.023 region:rollup2
WE HAVE A HUNDRED PLUS WET AND

02:02:08.154 --> 02:02:11.858 region:rollup2
DRY LABS SUPPORTING INSTRUCTION

02:02:10.023 --> 02:02:14.294 region:rollup2
AT UC DAVIS WITH CLASSES RUNNING

02:02:11.858 --> 02:02:16.462 region:rollup2
FAR INTO THE EVENING FOR MANY OF

02:02:14.294 --> 02:02:17.897 region:rollup2
OUR HIGH DEMAND COURSES.

02:02:16.462 --> 02:02:19.666 region:rollup2
YEAH OUR CHEMISTRY BUILDING

02:02:17.897 --> 02:02:21.734 region:rollup2
BUILT IN NINETEEN SIXTY SIX HAS

02:02:19.666 --> 02:02:23.837 region:rollup2
NEVER HAD A FULL RENOVATION.

02:02:21.734 --> 02:02:25.305 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS OF TRIMMING.

02:02:23.837 --> 02:02:26.739 region:rollup2
PART ME CHANGED DRAMATICALLY IN

02:02:25.305 --> 02:02:28.975 region:rollup2
THE LAST FIFTY YEARS.

02:02:26.739 --> 02:02:30.777 region:rollup2
THE INFRASTRUCTURE THE BUILDING

02:02:28.975 --> 02:02:32.111 region:rollup2
IS LAGGING FAR BEHIND. AND OF

02:02:30.777 --> 02:02:33.479 region:rollup2
COURSE WHEN A BUSY CROWDED

02:02:32.111 --> 02:02:35.014 region:rollup2
TWENTY FOUR SEVEN RESEARCH AND

02:02:33.479 --> 02:02:36.282 region:rollup2
TEACHING FACILITY.

02:02:35.014 --> 02:02:37.717 region:rollup2
SO WE DEVELOPED A COMPREHENSIVE

02:02:36.282 --> 02:02:39.686 region:rollup2
PLAN TO RENOVATE THE CHEMISTRY

02:02:37.717 --> 02:02:40.353 region:rollup2
BUILDING IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT.

02:02:39.686 --> 02:02:42.455 region:rollup2
AND OF COURSE THAT WAS THAT THE

02:02:40.353 --> 02:02:43.256 region:rollup2
STRIKE THE START OF THE FUNDING

02:02:42.455 --> 02:02:44.490 region:rollup2
CRISIS AND SO WE HAD TO SHELVE

02:02:43.256 --> 02:02:45.558 region:rollup2
THAT PLAN.

02:02:44.490 --> 02:02:48.194 region:rollup2
WE PULLED BACK OUT TWENTY

02:02:45.558 --> 02:02:49.429 region:rollup2
FOURTEEN WE WORKED ON UP A

02:02:48.194 --> 02:02:51.064 region:rollup2
REVISION OF THE PLAN TO INCREASE

02:02:49.429 --> 02:02:53.066 region:rollup2
CAPACITY OF THE EXISTING SPACE

02:02:51.064 --> 02:02:55.168 region:rollup2
BY TWENTY PERCENT. USING AN OPEN

02:02:53.066 --> 02:02:57.136 region:rollup2
MODULAR LAP CONCEPT.

02:02:55.168 --> 02:02:58.104 region:rollup2
THE STATUS TODAY.

02:02:57.136 --> 02:03:00.240 region:rollup2
WE'RE USING GENERAL FUND

02:02:58.104 --> 02:03:00.807 region:rollup2
FINANCING TO ADVANCE THIRTY FIVE

02:03:00.240 --> 02:03:02.041 region:rollup2
MILLION UPSIDES AT THE LIFE

02:03:00.807 --> 02:03:03.943 region:rollup2
SAFETY.

02:03:02.041 --> 02:03:05.745 region:rollup2
WERE ALSO INVESTING FIFTY FOUR

02:03:03.943 --> 02:03:08.815 region:rollup2
MILLION FROM CAMPUS FUNDS TO

02:03:05.745 --> 02:03:10.850 region:rollup2
ADDRESS CRITICAL EXHAUST AND

02:03:08.815 --> 02:03:12.585 region:rollup2
ELECTRICAL CAPACITY NEEDS WERE

02:03:10.850 --> 02:03:14.687 region:rollup2
CONSTRUCTING A SMALL ADDITION TO

02:03:12.585 --> 02:03:16.356 region:rollup2
GET DESKS AND FACULTY AND

02:03:14.687 --> 02:03:19.025 region:rollup2
RESEARCHERS RESEARCHERS OUT OF

02:03:16.356 --> 02:03:20.693 region:rollup2
LABS. AND INTO OFFICE SPACE.

02:03:19.025 --> 02:03:21.227 region:rollup2
AND WE'RE RENOVATING ABOUT TEN

02:03:20.693 --> 02:03:22.929 region:rollup2
PERCENT OF THAT CHEMISTRY

02:03:21.227 --> 02:03:24.497 region:rollup2
BUILDING.

02:03:22.929 --> 02:03:25.598 region:rollup2
TO DO THE WHOLE THING WE NEED

02:03:24.497 --> 02:03:27.066 region:rollup2
ANOTHER ELEVEN MILLION FOR A

02:03:25.598 --> 02:03:27.233 region:rollup2
SECOND PHASE.

02:03:27.066 --> 02:03:29.068 region:rollup2
OF.

02:03:27.233 --> 02:03:31.638 region:rollup2
.

02:03:29.068 --> 02:03:32.772 region:rollup2
WORK THAT WE'RE POSTPONING AND

02:03:31.638 --> 02:03:33.606 region:rollup2
THEN WE HAVE PHASES AND AN

02:03:32.772 --> 02:03:35.441 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL THREE PHASES THAT

02:03:33.606 --> 02:03:36.943 region:rollup2
WOULD TOTAL ANOTHER HUNDRED

02:03:35.441 --> 02:03:38.811 region:rollup2
FORTY MILLION. TO. RENOVATE THE

02:03:36.943 --> 02:03:41.214 region:rollup2
WHOLE BUILDING.

02:03:38.811 --> 02:03:43.583 region:rollup2
WE HAVE TO PHASE BECAUSE WHEN

02:03:41.214 --> 02:03:45.184 region:rollup2
THESE ARE ACTIVE SPACES AND SO

02:03:43.583 --> 02:03:46.185 region:rollup2
IN ORDER TO AVOID DISRUPTION AND

02:03:45.184 --> 02:03:46.853 region:rollup2
MOVE FOLKS IN AND OUT IT TAKES

02:03:46.185 --> 02:03:48.855 region:rollup2
THIS PHASED APPROACH.

02:03:46.853 --> 02:03:50.256 region:rollup2
BUT.

02:03:48.855 --> 02:03:51.391 region:rollup2
THE SUBSEQUENT PHASES I'M

02:03:50.256 --> 02:03:52.926 region:rollup2
MENTIONING THEY'RE NOT SCHEDULED

02:03:51.391 --> 02:03:53.927 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT FUNDED. AND

02:03:52.926 --> 02:03:55.728 region:rollup2
SO WE'RE GONNA GET THROUGH A

02:03:53.927 --> 02:03:57.864 region:rollup2
CERTAIN AMOUNT OF PROGRESS IN

02:03:55.728 --> 02:03:58.931 region:rollup2
AND THEN WE'LL BE BACK PROBABLY

02:03:57.864 --> 02:04:00.099 region:rollup2
IN A LAP BY LAP BRAND OF PATIENT

02:03:58.931 --> 02:04:01.434 region:rollup2
MODE.

02:04:00.099 --> 02:04:03.169 region:rollup2
THE STORY OF CHEMISTRY IT'S

02:04:01.434 --> 02:04:05.071 region:rollup2
REPEATING AND ANOTHER SIX

02:04:03.169 --> 02:04:06.105 region:rollup2
BUILDINGS COMPRISING.

02:04:05.071 --> 02:04:07.273 region:rollup2
A HALF MILLION SQUARE FEET THAT

02:04:06.105 --> 02:04:09.075 region:rollup2
WERE BUILT IN THE SIXTIES AND

02:04:07.273 --> 02:04:11.110 region:rollup2
SEVENTIES WE HAVE LARGE

02:04:09.075 --> 02:04:13.079 region:rollup2
BUILDINGS WHERE WE COULD DO MORE

02:04:11.110 --> 02:04:14.814 region:rollup2
ABOUT BUT WITHOUT.

02:04:13.079 --> 02:04:16.249 region:rollup2
PLANNING FUNDING THAT WE CAN

02:04:14.814 --> 02:04:17.183 region:rollup2
COUNT ON AND PLANNED FOR IT'S

02:04:16.249 --> 02:04:19.218 region:rollup2
REALLY DIFFICULT TO EXECUTE ON

02:04:17.183 --> 02:04:20.787 region:rollup2
THESE PLANS.

02:04:19.218 --> 02:04:22.522 region:rollup2
SO I'LL ALL END WITH THE

02:04:20.787 --> 02:04:25.191 region:rollup2
OBSERVATION THAT UC DAVIS WE

02:04:22.522 --> 02:04:25.792 region:rollup2
HAVE A VISION WE HAVE PLANS AND

02:04:25.191 --> 02:04:27.226 region:rollup2
WE HAVE GOOD FOLKS DOING GOOD

02:04:25.792 --> 02:04:28.494 region:rollup2
WORK.

02:04:27.226 --> 02:04:30.163 region:rollup2
TO BE SUCCESSFUL WHEN HE

02:04:28.494 --> 02:04:32.699 region:rollup2
PARTNERSHIP AND WE NEED STABLE

02:04:30.163 --> 02:04:33.800 region:rollup2
AND PREDICTABLE CAPITAL FUNDING.

02:04:32.699 --> 02:04:35.668 region:rollup2
AND WE'RE GOING TO DO ANYTHING

02:04:33.800 --> 02:04:37.437 region:rollup2
ALONG THE LINES I HAVE ADVANCING

02:04:35.668 --> 02:04:39.005 region:rollup2
THE PP I SEE GOALS MEETS TALK

02:04:37.437 --> 02:04:40.506 region:rollup2
ABOUT THAT CAPITAL FUNDING. UP

02:04:39.005 --> 02:04:41.674 region:rollup2
FRONT SO THAT WE REALLY CAN

02:04:40.506 --> 02:04:42.842 region:rollup2
EXECUTE AND HAVE THOSE

02:04:41.674 --> 02:04:43.843 region:rollup2
FACILITIES AVAILABLE AS THE

02:04:42.842 --> 02:04:50.883 region:rollup2
STUDENTS ARRIVE.

02:04:43.843 --> 02:04:54.487 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

02:04:50.883 --> 02:04:55.788 region:rollup2
QUESTION.

02:04:54.487 --> 02:04:56.823 region:rollup2
THE CHECK SHARE.

02:04:55.788 --> 02:04:59.292 region:rollup2
I HAVE A QUESTION.

02:04:56.823 --> 02:05:00.860 region:rollup2
REFERRING TO SLIDE ONE.

02:04:59.292 --> 02:05:02.595 region:rollup2
THAT YOU HANDED OUT HERE YOU

02:05:00.860 --> 02:05:03.529 region:rollup2
HAVE THE THE THIRD BULLET POINT

02:05:02.595 --> 02:05:05.431 region:rollup2
ESTIMATED GENERAL FUND

02:05:03.529 --> 02:05:07.400 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATION INCREASE OF ONE

02:05:05.431 --> 02:05:09.168 region:rollup2
BILLION A YEAR FOR INVOLVEMENT.

02:05:07.400 --> 02:05:11.137 region:rollup2
WAS. WHAT WHAT IS THE CURRENT?

02:05:09.168 --> 02:05:14.941 region:rollup2
GENERAL FUND APPROPRIATION FOR

02:05:11.137 --> 02:05:17.043 region:rollup2
ENROLLMENT.

02:05:14.941 --> 02:05:18.177 region:rollup2
I THINK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER SO

02:05:17.043 --> 02:05:20.146 region:rollup2
THAT CURRENT GENERAL FUND

02:05:18.177 --> 02:05:20.313 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATION FOR THE UNIVERSITY

02:05:20.146 --> 02:05:22.081 region:rollup2
IS.

02:05:20.313 --> 02:05:23.916 region:rollup2
A LITTLE BIT OVER THREE POINT

02:05:22.081 --> 02:05:27.253 region:rollup2
FOUR BILLION.

02:05:23.916 --> 02:05:30.556 region:rollup2
THAT UNIVERSITY RECEIVES.

02:05:27.253 --> 02:05:31.524 region:rollup2
TO PRIMARY SOURCES OF FUNDS FOR

02:05:30.556 --> 02:05:33.092 region:rollup2
WHAT WE CALL OUR CORE BUDGET

02:05:31.524 --> 02:05:34.894 region:rollup2
ABOUT STATE GENERAL FUND THAT I

02:05:33.092 --> 02:05:36.863 region:rollup2
JUST REFERENCED AND THEN.

02:05:34.894 --> 02:05:37.930 region:rollup2
TUITION AS WELL AYE THERE ARE

02:05:36.863 --> 02:05:39.298 region:rollup2
SOME OTHER.

02:05:37.930 --> 02:05:40.666 region:rollup2
FUNDS THAT GOING TO YOU SEE

02:05:39.298 --> 02:05:42.835 region:rollup2
WHAT WE CALL YOU SEE GENERAL

02:05:40.666 --> 02:05:45.104 region:rollup2
FUND SOME PATENT INCOME THOSE

02:05:42.835 --> 02:05:46.973 region:rollup2
SORTS OF THINGS. ABOUT THAT THAT

02:05:45.104 --> 02:05:49.776 region:rollup2
CONSTITUTES OUR COURT BUDGET AND

02:05:46.973 --> 02:05:51.310 region:rollup2
THAT IS WHAT WE EXPAND FROM FOR

02:05:49.776 --> 02:05:53.579 region:rollup2
OUR AYE INSTRUCTION.

02:05:51.310 --> 02:05:54.714 region:rollup2
AND RESEARCH PURPOSES SO SO IN

02:05:53.579 --> 02:05:56.983 region:rollup2
OTHER WORDS IN ORDER TO.

02:05:54.714 --> 02:05:59.185 region:rollup2
ACCOMPLISH A.

02:05:56.983 --> 02:06:00.420 region:rollup2
THE TO A FIFTY THOUSAND MORE

02:05:59.185 --> 02:06:01.754 region:rollup2
BACHELOR'S DEGREES BY TWENTY

02:06:00.420 --> 02:06:03.656 region:rollup2
THIRTY WE WILL HAVE TO INCREASE

02:06:01.754 --> 02:06:06.092 region:rollup2
THE.

02:06:03.656 --> 02:06:07.060 region:rollup2
BY BYE ALMOST TOOK.

02:06:06.092 --> 02:06:08.094 region:rollup2
.

02:06:07.060 --> 02:06:10.363 region:rollup2
BUT MORE THAN A THIRD.

02:06:08.094 --> 02:06:12.231 region:rollup2
.

02:06:10.363 --> 02:06:14.066 region:rollup2
MORE THAN THIRTY PERCENT.

02:06:12.231 --> 02:06:17.003 region:rollup2
YEAR FOR ENROLLMENT.

02:06:14.066 --> 02:06:18.805 region:rollup2
SO OUR ESTIMATE IS THAT.

02:06:17.003 --> 02:06:21.107 region:rollup2
AND ACHIEVING THAT AMOUNT OF

02:06:18.805 --> 02:06:23.943 region:rollup2
ENROLLMENT IT WOULD TAKE.

02:06:21.107 --> 02:06:26.679 region:rollup2
AT BILLION ADDITIONAL AS A BASE

02:06:23.943 --> 02:06:29.816 region:rollup2
ON GOING.

02:06:26.679 --> 02:06:30.983 region:rollup2
BUDGET THAT I. ADDITIONAL AYE

02:06:29.816 --> 02:06:33.019 region:rollup2
AYE AUGMENTATION ARE BASED ON

02:06:30.983 --> 02:06:33.753 region:rollup2
GOING BUDGET YES

02:06:33.019 --> 02:06:35.588 region:rollup2
SO BASED ON AND.

02:06:33.753 --> 02:06:37.090 region:rollup2
.

02:06:35.588 --> 02:06:38.758 region:rollup2
WHAT WE CALL I'D A STATE CHAIR

02:06:37.090 --> 02:06:40.593 region:rollup2
MARGINAL COST OF INSTRUCTION IF

02:06:38.758 --> 02:06:41.227 region:rollup2
WE ESTIMATE THAT WE'RE EXPANDING

02:06:40.593 --> 02:06:43.396 region:rollup2
ABOUT?

02:06:41.227 --> 02:06:44.664 region:rollup2
TWENTY THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS.

02:06:43.396 --> 02:06:46.666 region:rollup2
TO EDUCATE A STUDENT.

02:06:44.664 --> 02:06:49.368 region:rollup2
ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND OF THAT

02:06:46.666 --> 02:06:50.870 region:rollup2
AMOUNT IS I SPENT FOR FINANCIAL

02:06:49.368 --> 02:06:52.705 region:rollup2
AID PURPOSES.

02:06:50.870 --> 02:06:55.241 region:rollup2
WHICH BRINGS US DOWN TO AROUND

02:06:52.705 --> 02:06:57.810 region:rollup2
THAT EIGHTEEN NINETEEN RANGE.

02:06:55.241 --> 02:07:00.580 region:rollup2
IF ABOUT THIRTEEN OR SO.

02:06:57.810 --> 02:07:03.916 region:rollup2
OF THAT OF THOSE DOLLARS ARE

02:07:00.580 --> 02:07:04.951 region:rollup2
ARE COMING IN FROM.

02:07:03.916 --> 02:07:05.785 region:rollup2
STUDENTS TO ASH AND.

02:07:04.951 --> 02:07:08.054 region:rollup2
THE BALANCE IS WHAT WE

02:07:05.785 --> 02:07:09.755 region:rollup2
CONSIDERED TO BE A STATE CHAIR

02:07:08.054 --> 02:07:10.756 region:rollup2
ROCK COMBINED WITH TUITION AND.

02:07:09.755 --> 02:07:11.791 region:rollup2
AND IF YOU LOOK AT THAT

02:07:10.756 --> 02:07:13.993 region:rollup2
CUMULATIVE INCREASE IN

02:07:11.791 --> 02:07:15.461 region:rollup2
ENROLLMENT OF A HUNDRED AND SIX

02:07:13.993 --> 02:07:17.230 region:rollup2
THOUSAND YOU ASSUME THE TEN

02:07:15.461 --> 02:07:19.632 region:rollup2
THOUSAND DOLLARS PER STUDENT

02:07:17.230 --> 02:07:20.266 region:rollup2
THAT GETS YOU OUT TO UP MOUNT.

02:07:19.632 --> 02:07:22.034 region:rollup2
OKAY SO.

02:07:20.266 --> 02:07:23.736 region:rollup2
.

02:07:22.034 --> 02:07:25.071 region:rollup2
BUT OF THE THREE POINT FOUR

02:07:23.736 --> 02:07:27.006 region:rollup2
BILLION IN THE CURRENT GENERAL

02:07:25.071 --> 02:07:27.840 region:rollup2
FUND APPROPRIATION AND NOT ALL

02:07:27.006 --> 02:07:29.509 region:rollup2
OF THAT IS GOING TOWARD

02:07:27.840 --> 02:07:30.376 region:rollup2
ENROLLMENT CURRENT.

02:07:29.509 --> 02:07:31.911 region:rollup2
THAT'S CORRECT THERE'S A

02:07:30.376 --> 02:07:33.946 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF IT THAT

02:07:31.911 --> 02:07:36.849 region:rollup2
IT'S GOING FOR CAPITAL FOR.

02:07:33.946 --> 02:07:38.684 region:rollup2
FINANCING FOR CAPITAL PURPOSES.

02:07:36.849 --> 02:07:40.987 region:rollup2
AND I THINK.

02:07:38.684 --> 02:07:43.823 region:rollup2
PROBABLY.

02:07:40.987 --> 02:07:46.125 region:rollup2
PAMELA MIGHT BE ABLE TO TELL US

02:07:43.823 --> 02:07:48.961 region:rollup2
AYE HOW MUCH OF OUR EXPAND.

02:07:46.125 --> 02:07:51.497 region:rollup2
FOR FACULTY SALARIES FOR STAFF

02:07:48.961 --> 02:07:53.332 region:rollup2
SALARIES IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO.

02:07:51.497 --> 02:07:57.003 region:rollup2
STATE GENERAL FUND.

02:07:53.332 --> 02:07:58.905 region:rollup2
WHO?

02:07:57.003 --> 02:08:00.039 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY I HAVE YET WE WE DON'T

02:07:58.905 --> 02:08:01.607 region:rollup2
HAVE TO GO INTO THAT IN DETAIL

02:08:00.039 --> 02:08:03.342 region:rollup2
NOW I AM JUST TRYING TO GET A.

02:08:01.607 --> 02:08:04.944 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW I GOT A. IN OVER A

02:08:03.342 --> 02:08:05.244 region:rollup2
REALITY CHECK HERE OF HOW MUCH

02:08:04.944 --> 02:08:07.547 region:rollup2
MORE MONEY.

02:08:05.244 --> 02:08:08.948 region:rollup2
WOULD BE REQUIRED TO ACHIEVE

02:08:07.547 --> 02:08:09.382 region:rollup2
THE TO INVADE THOUSAND MORE

02:08:08.948 --> 02:08:10.917 region:rollup2
BACHELOR'S DEGREES.

02:08:09.382 --> 02:08:13.920 region:rollup2
.

02:08:10.917 --> 02:08:16.389 region:rollup2
THIS IS SO SO THE ONE BILLION A

02:08:13.920 --> 02:08:17.957 region:rollup2
YEAR OF THAT. THAT WOULD BE THAT

02:08:16.389 --> 02:08:18.858 region:rollup2
THAT THAT BASICALLY ONE BILLION

02:08:17.957 --> 02:08:20.860 region:rollup2
IN ADDITIONAL CHAU OFF AN

02:08:18.858 --> 02:08:21.661 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATION TO INCLUDE

02:08:20.860 --> 02:08:23.229 region:rollup2
ENROLLMENT AS WELL AS.

02:08:21.661 --> 02:08:26.299 region:rollup2
.

02:08:23.229 --> 02:08:28.234 region:rollup2
CAPITAL OUTLAY.

02:08:26.299 --> 02:08:30.369 region:rollup2
NO CAP THE CAPITAL OUTLAY WOULD

02:08:28.234 --> 02:08:32.138 region:rollup2
BE SEPARATE SO I WHEN WE'RE

02:08:30.369 --> 02:08:33.906 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT ENROLLMENT GROWTH

02:08:32.138 --> 02:08:35.241 region:rollup2
WE GENERALLY TRY AND USE.

02:08:33.906 --> 02:08:36.676 region:rollup2
BASICALLY AIR RIGHT.

02:08:35.241 --> 02:08:38.878 region:rollup2
IN AMOUNTS THAT.

02:08:36.676 --> 02:08:41.013 region:rollup2
WE ATTRIBUTE APPORTIONED IT

02:08:38.878 --> 02:08:42.148 region:rollup2
TUITION AND A PORTION TO STATE

02:08:41.013 --> 02:08:44.417 region:rollup2
CONTRIBUTION.

02:08:42.148 --> 02:08:46.152 region:rollup2
TO ADDRESS WHAT IT COST TO

02:08:44.417 --> 02:08:48.521 region:rollup2
EDUCATE ONE ADDITIONAL NEW

02:08:46.152 --> 02:08:50.389 region:rollup2
STUDENT ON AN ONGOING BASIS.

02:08:48.521 --> 02:08:52.258 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S WHERE WE COME UP WITH

02:08:50.389 --> 02:08:54.060 region:rollup2
THE E. TEN THOUSAND PER STATE

02:08:52.258 --> 02:08:55.795 region:rollup2
STUDENT AS SORT OF A HISTORICAL

02:08:54.060 --> 02:08:57.263 region:rollup2
STATE SHARE. THAT'S BEEN

02:08:55.795 --> 02:08:58.698 region:rollup2
PROVIDED SO FOR INSTANCE WHEN

02:08:57.263 --> 02:09:00.199 region:rollup2
THE YOM.

02:08:58.698 --> 02:09:02.034 region:rollup2
STATE PROVIDED ENROLLMENT GROWTH

02:09:00.199 --> 02:09:03.703 region:rollup2
FUNDING RECENTLY FOR AYE

02:09:02.034 --> 02:09:05.204 region:rollup2
GRADUATE STUDENTS

02:09:03.703 --> 02:09:06.305 region:rollup2
I BELIEVE WE LANDED ON SIX

02:09:05.204 --> 02:09:07.773 region:rollup2
HUNDRED GRADUATE STUDENT

02:09:06.305 --> 02:09:08.808 region:rollup2
ENROLLMENT GROWTH FOR SIX

02:09:07.773 --> 02:09:10.343 region:rollup2
MILLION DOLLARS IN THAT BUDGET

02:09:08.808 --> 02:09:11.911 region:rollup2
THERE WAS.

02:09:10.343 --> 02:09:13.079 region:rollup2
A COUPLE DIFFERENT GOING ON BUT

02:09:11.911 --> 02:09:15.448 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD BE TEN THOUSAND

02:09:13.079 --> 02:09:16.916 region:rollup2
DOLLARS PER STUDENT.

02:09:15.448 --> 02:09:18.651 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S WHY WITH THE OTHER

02:09:16.916 --> 02:09:20.052 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL THAT WE'VE PROVIDED

02:09:18.651 --> 02:09:21.587 region:rollup2
WHICH HAS BOTH GRADUATE AND

02:09:20.052 --> 02:09:23.789 region:rollup2
UNDERGRADUATE GROWTH.

02:09:21.587 --> 02:09:26.092 region:rollup2
THAT WE CALL THAT A MORE MODEST

02:09:23.789 --> 02:09:27.393 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL IT STILL WOULD REQUIRE

02:09:26.092 --> 02:09:29.128 region:rollup2
A SIGNIFICANT.

02:09:27.393 --> 02:09:31.631 region:rollup2
OUTLAY IN FUNDS IT BE ABOUT

02:09:29.128 --> 02:09:32.265 region:rollup2
HALF OF WHAT WOULD BE REQUIRED

02:09:31.631 --> 02:09:35.735 region:rollup2
IF WE JUST DID A.

02:09:32.265 --> 02:09:37.169 region:rollup2
pTHERE.

02:09:35.735 --> 02:09:38.271 region:rollup2
AND OUR OUR FEELING ABOUT

02:09:37.169 --> 02:09:40.473 region:rollup2
SOMETHING ALONG THIS PRO

02:09:38.271 --> 02:09:41.707 region:rollup2
APPROACH BY LOOKING AT GRADUATE

02:09:40.473 --> 02:09:43.109 region:rollup2
STUDENTS IN ADDITION TO

02:09:41.707 --> 02:09:44.577 region:rollup2
UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS AT BOTH

02:09:43.109 --> 02:09:47.046 region:rollup2
SUPPORTS THE EDUCATION OF THE

02:09:44.577 --> 02:09:48.614 region:rollup2
UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS. IT MEETS

02:09:47.046 --> 02:09:50.816 region:rollup2
THE WORK FORCE THEN AND ECONOMIC

02:09:48.614 --> 02:09:51.717 region:rollup2
NEEDS OF THE STATE MOVING AHEAD.

02:09:50.816 --> 02:09:54.820 region:rollup2
AND.

02:09:51.717 --> 02:09:56.022 region:rollup2
OF WOULD HAVE A BETTER BALANCE

02:09:54.820 --> 02:09:57.757 region:rollup2
FOR US AS WE LOOKED AHEAD.

02:09:56.022 --> 02:09:59.859 region:rollup2
SO IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE FOR THE

02:09:57.757 --> 02:10:01.627 region:rollup2
ALTERNATE SCENARIO. OF HOW MUCH

02:09:59.859 --> 02:10:02.662 region:rollup2
MORE OF A GENERAL FUND

02:10:01.627 --> 02:10:03.929 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATION INCREASE ARE WE

02:10:02.662 --> 02:10:06.098 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT SO IT'S ABOUT HALF

02:10:03.929 --> 02:10:08.167 region:rollup2
OF. WHAT WOULD BE REQUIRED UNDER

02:10:06.098 --> 02:10:09.969 region:rollup2
THERE SO AROUND ON FIVE HUNDRED

02:10:08.167 --> 02:10:16.309 region:rollup2
MILLION HEALTH?

02:10:09.969 --> 02:10:17.977 region:rollup2
I THINK IT.

02:10:16.309 --> 02:10:19.345 region:rollup2
I LIKE THAT ASK A QUESTION ABOUT

02:10:17.977 --> 02:10:21.580 region:rollup2
THE A PROPOSAL.

02:10:19.345 --> 02:10:23.315 region:rollup2
OF INCREASING.

02:10:21.580 --> 02:10:25.351 region:rollup2
THE. PERCENTAGE OF HIGH SCHOOL

02:10:23.315 --> 02:10:26.552 region:rollup2
GRADUATES

02:10:25.351 --> 02:10:29.288 region:rollup2
SO IN THE MASTER PLAN THE

02:10:26.552 --> 02:10:30.289 region:rollup2
NINETEEN SIXTY. MASTER PLAN WHAT

02:10:29.288 --> 02:10:31.457 region:rollup2
WE'RE IT TWELVE POINT FIVE

02:10:30.289 --> 02:10:34.427 region:rollup2
CRACKED.

02:10:31.457 --> 02:10:35.428 region:rollup2
.

02:10:34.427 --> 02:10:37.430 region:rollup2
WE HEARD TESTIMONY THAT.

02:10:35.428 --> 02:10:39.665 region:rollup2
.

02:10:37.430 --> 02:10:42.001 region:rollup2
GOING TO SEVENTEEN POINT FIVE.

02:10:39.665 --> 02:10:44.503 region:rollup2
WOULD INCREASE THE DIVERSITY OF

02:10:42.001 --> 02:10:46.439 region:rollup2
STUDENTS AND ALSO ADDRESS.

02:10:44.503 --> 02:10:47.740 region:rollup2
MORE OF THE SOCIO ECONOMIC

02:10:46.439 --> 02:10:49.942 region:rollup2
DISPARITY.

02:10:47.740 --> 02:10:51.777 region:rollup2
OF OF STUDENTS.

02:10:49.942 --> 02:10:53.646 region:rollup2
CAN YOU COMMENT ON.

02:10:51.777 --> 02:10:56.115 region:rollup2
MOVING THE THAT THE PERCENTAGE

02:10:53.646 --> 02:10:57.516 region:rollup2
OF HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES US SO

02:10:56.115 --> 02:10:58.751 region:rollup2
IF WE LOOK AT WHAT'S BEEN

02:10:57.516 --> 02:11:00.619 region:rollup2
HAPPENING OVER THE LAST FEW

02:10:58.751 --> 02:11:02.121 region:rollup2
YEARS THE LARGEST. GROWING

02:11:00.619 --> 02:11:04.156 region:rollup2
POPULATION OF OUR UNDERGRADUATE

02:11:02.121 --> 02:11:04.890 region:rollup2
STUDENTS ARE CHICANO LATINOS AND

02:11:04.156 --> 02:11:06.325 region:rollup2
WE BELIEVE THAT THAT WILL

02:11:04.890 --> 02:11:08.527 region:rollup2
CONTINUE UNDER EITHER THE

02:11:06.325 --> 02:11:10.463 region:rollup2
PROPOSALS AND THAT WE HAVE IN

02:11:08.527 --> 02:11:12.164 region:rollup2
FRONT OF YOU TODAY. THE FIRST

THOUSAND THAT.

02:11:14.700 --> 02:11:17.737 region:rollup2
ASSUMES THAT WE WOULD GO FROM

02:11:16.369 --> 02:11:20.206 region:rollup2
ABOUT TWELVE AND A HALF TO

02:11:17.737 --> 02:11:23.275 region:rollup2
SEVENTEEN PERCENT A AND.

02:11:20.206 --> 02:11:25.044 region:rollup2
EH AGAIN IT WOULD INCREASE A

02:11:23.275 --> 02:11:26.746 region:rollup2
YEAR THAT AS WE LOOK AT THE HIGH

02:11:25.044 --> 02:11:28.214 region:rollup2
SCHOOL POPULATION GOING THROUGH

02:11:26.746 --> 02:11:28.481 region:rollup2
ITS BECOMING INCREASINGLY

02:11:28.214 --> 02:11:30.816 region:rollup2
DIVERSE.

02:11:28.481 --> 02:11:33.953 region:rollup2
SO YOU BE PULLING AND.

02:11:30.816 --> 02:11:35.721 region:rollup2
THAT A UNDER UP EITHER PROPOSAL

02:11:33.953 --> 02:11:40.092 region:rollup2
IT'S JUST THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS

02:11:35.721 --> 02:11:41.894 region:rollup2

02:27:30.308 --> 02:27:34.045 region:rollup2
WHERE THERE ARE ACHIEVEMENT GAPS

02:27:32.744 --> 02:27:35.547 region:rollup2
IN COURSE PERFORMANCE AND IF

ARE USED TO IDENTIFY COURSES

02:27:42.053 --> 02:27:45.190 region:rollup2
THAT ARE SLOWING STUDENTS

02:27:43.388 --> 02:27:47.425 region:rollup2
PROGRESS TO GRADUATION. DRIVE

02:27:45.190 --> 02:27:48.793 region:rollup2
CLASS DRIVING CLASS SCHEDULING

02:27:47.425 --> 02:27:50.495 region:rollup2

02:27:50.495 --> 02:27:54.766 region:rollup2
MOST EFFECTIVE.

02:27:52.263 --> 02:27:56.901 region:rollup2
AND FINALLY THIS SIXTH AREA IS

02:27:54.766 --> 02:27:59.537 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATIVE BARRIERS WHERE WE

02:27:56.901 --> 02:28:01.172 region:rollup2
ARE IDENTIFYING AND REMOVING

02:27:59.537 --> 02:28:03.374 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATIVE IMPEDIMENTS TO

02:28:03.374 --> 02:28:07.312 region:rollup2
AS BUT ONE EXAMPLE SAN DIEGO

02:28:05.276 --> 02:28:09.481 region:rollup2
STATE IS CHANGING ITS CLASS

02:28:07.312 --> 02:28:10.982 region:rollup2

EIGHTEEN SEMESTER THIS CHANGE

02:28:14.719 --> 02:28:18.757 region:rollup2
WILL MAKE IT EASIER FOR STUDENTS

02:28:16.721 --> 02:28:20.425 region:rollup2
TO MEET WITH ADVISORS AND

02:28:18.757 --> 02:28:21.893 region:rollup2
DEVELOP ACADEMIC SCHEDULES

02:28:20.425 --> 02:28:24.396 region:rollup2
DURING CRITICAL PRE REGISTRATION

02:28:21.893 --> 02:28:25.730 region:rollup2
PERIODS.

02:28:24.396 --> 02:28:27.766 region:rollup2
THE STRATEGIES THAT I'VE JUST

02:28:25.730 --> 02:28:30.401 region:rollup2
DESCRIBED BOTH CAMPUS BASED AND

02:28:27.766 --> 02:28:31.636 region:rollup2
SYSTEM WIDE ARE ALREADY HAVING A

02:28:30.401 --> 02:28:33.905 region:rollup2
MEASURABLE IMPACT ON CSU

STUDENTS.

02:28:33.905 --> 02:28:37.876 region:rollup2
THIS PAST YEAR TWENTY SIXTEEN

SEVENTEEN THE STATE INVESTED

02:28:37.876 --> 02:28:41.179 region:rollup2
THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN

02:28:39.544 --> 02:28:44.349 region:rollup2
ONE TIME FUNDING IN THE C.

02:28:41.179 --> 02:28:45.984 region:rollup2
ISSUES STUDENT SUCCESS EFFORTS.

02:28:44.349 --> 02:28:47.485 region:rollup2
I AM PROUD TO STATE THAT A

02:28:45.984 --> 02:28:48.686 region:rollup2
LITTLE MORE THAN ONE YEAR INTO

02:28:47.485 --> 02:28:50.388 region:rollup2

CALIFORNIA ALREADY SEEING A

02:28:53.892 --> 02:28:56.561 region:rollup2
STRONG RETURN ON THAT

02:28:54.359 --> 02:28:58.830 region:rollup2
INVESTMENT.

02:28:56.561 --> 02:29:01.232 region:rollup2
NEARLY NINETY NINE THOUSAND CSU

THIS REPRESENTS AN ALL TIME HIGH

02:29:05.737 --> 02:29:08.406 region:rollup2
FOR THE CALIFORNIA STATE

02:29:06.738 --> 02:29:09.741 region:rollup2

02:29:08.406 --> 02:29:11.876 region:rollup2
WITH AN ADDITIONAL SEVEN

02:29:09.741 --> 02:29:13.411 region:rollup2
THOUSAND STUDENTS CROSSING THAT

02:29:11.876 --> 02:29:15.647 region:rollup2
COMMENCEMENT STAGE COMPARED TO

LAST YEAR.

02:29:15.647 --> 02:29:18.783 region:rollup2
AND SOME CAMPUSES.

02:29:17.415 --> 02:29:20.852 region:rollup2
IMPROVEMENTS REALLY HAVE BEEN

02:29:18.783 --> 02:29:22.954 region:rollup2
QUITE DRAMATIC.

02:29:20.852 --> 02:29:24.689 region:rollup2
CSU MONTEREY BAY HAS INCREASED

02:29:22.954 --> 02:29:26.991 region:rollup2
THEIR FOR YOUR GRADUATION RATES

02:29:24.689 --> 02:29:29.160 region:rollup2

02:29:29.160 --> 02:29:32.397 region:rollup2
GRADUATION INITIATIVE TWENTY

02:29:30.695 --> 02:29:34.165 region:rollup2
TWENTY FIVE HAS COMMENCED.

AT SYNONYMOUS STATE

02:29:34.165 --> 02:29:37.202 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE BEENCHRIS THEIR TWO

STUDENT SUCCESS.

02:29:48.847 --> 02:29:52.317 region:rollup2
SO WHAT THIS IS MEAN.

02:29:50.915 --> 02:29:54.419 region:rollup2
FIRST AND FOREMOST IT MEANS THAT

02:29:52.317 --> 02:29:56.254 region:rollup2
THESE GRADUATES ARE ABLE TO MOVE

02:29:54.419 --> 02:29:57.722 region:rollup2

FOR SUCCESS.

02:29:59.524 --> 02:30:03.428 region:rollup2
SECONDLY IT MEANS THAT MORE

02:30:01.459 --> 02:30:03.962 region:rollup2

NEEDS.

02:30:06.030 --> 02:30:10.068 region:rollup2
AND THIRDLY IT MEANS MORE ACCESS

02:30:08.299 --> 02:30:12.403 region:rollup2
FOR NEW STUDENTS LOOKING TO

02:30:10.068 --> 02:30:14.305 region:rollup2
ENTER THE CSU.

02:30:12.403 --> 02:30:16.140 region:rollup2
THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT

02:30:14.305 --> 02:30:18.243 region:rollup2
BECAUSE DEMAND FOR A CS YOU

02:30:16.140 --> 02:30:20.278 region:rollup2

02:30:18.243 --> 02:30:21.446 region:rollup2
EVER BEEN BEFORE.

THE RECENT HIGHER EDUCATION

02:30:21.446 --> 02:30:24.816 region:rollup2
ELIGIBILITY STUDY FOUND THAT THE

02:30:23.481 --> 02:30:26.284 region:rollup2

SEE IT'S YOU. HAS INCREASED TO

02:30:31.623 --> 02:30:35.393 region:rollup2
FORTY ONE PERCENT.

02:30:33.157 --> 02:30:37.662 region:rollup2
A TESTAMENT TO IMPROVING K.

02:30:35.393 --> 02:30:39.564 region:rollup2
TWELVE OUTCOMES AND STRONG

02:30:37.662 --> 02:30:41.733 region:rollup2

COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES.

02:30:41.733 --> 02:30:45.503 region:rollup2
AND AT THE SAME TIME MORE

02:30:43.301 --> 02:30:46.938 region:rollup2

MORE STUDENTS WILL TAKE

02:30:57.849 --> 02:31:01.119 region:rollup2
ADVANTAGE OF THIS PATHWAY. AS

02:30:59.951 --> 02:31:02.921 region:rollup2

AMBITIOUS GOALS.

02:31:04.889 --> 02:31:07.959 region:rollup2
THESE TRENDS ARE REALLY GREAT

02:31:06.157 --> 02:31:09.961 region:rollup2

THE NEXT FEW YEARS.

02:33:45.083 --> 02:33:49.487 region:rollup2
THE FIRST IS JUST THE COST OF

02:33:46.751 --> 02:33:50.488 region:rollup2
INCREASED ACCESS AND COMPLETION.

YOU CAN IMAGINE AS I JUST

02:33:58.729 --> 02:34:03.067 region:rollup2
DESCRIBED SO SIMPLY PUT.

02:34:01.099 --> 02:34:05.036 region:rollup2
MORE STUDENTS MEAN MORE COURSE

02:34:03.067 --> 02:34:06.771 region:rollup2
SECTIONS IN COURSES THAT MEANS

02:34:05.036 --> 02:34:08.673 region:rollup2
MORE FACT BEEN ADVISERS TO

SUPPORT THOSE COURSES AND COURSE

02:34:08.673 --> 02:34:11.809 region:rollup2
THAT TRANSLATES INTO MORE COSTS.

02:34:10.608 --> 02:34:12.910 region:rollup2
WE ESTIMATE OVER THE NEXT

02:34:11.809 --> 02:34:13.811 region:rollup2
SEVERAL YEARS HE ISSUE WILL NEED

02:34:12.910 --> 02:34:15.580 region:rollup2
AN ADDITIONAL SEVENTY FIVE

02:34:13.811 --> 02:34:17.248 region:rollup2
MILLION DOLLARS.

FIVE MILLION DOLLARS.

02:34:23.554 --> 02:34:26.858 region:rollup2
ONE REASON FOR THE NEED FOR THIS

02:34:25.323 --> 02:34:28.326 region:rollup2
INVESTMENT CAN BE UNDERSTOOD

02:34:26.858 --> 02:34:30.094 region:rollup2

PICK A LIMITS

02:34:42.640 --> 02:34:46.377 region:rollup2
QUICKLY THEN GO TO THE COST OF

02:34:54.719 --> 02:34:57.622 region:rollup2
BEEN FOCUSING VERY HEAVILY ON

02:34:56.687 --> 02:34:59.190 region:rollup2
OUR CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE

02:34:57.622 --> 02:35:00.925 region:rollup2

OUR OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS.

02:35:00.925 --> 02:35:05.363 region:rollup2
BUT WE CONTINUE TO HAVE MAJOR

02:35:03.861 --> 02:35:06.931 region:rollup2
PROBLEMS IN THIS AREA AT THE C.

02:35:05.363 --> 02:35:09.133 region:rollup2
ISSUE CONTINUES TO EXPERIENCE

02:35:06.931 --> 02:35:10.835 region:rollup2

WHAT CAN WE DO DIFFERENTLY TO TO

02:39:48.379 --> 02:39:53.017 region:rollup2
MINIMIZE THAT THE NEED TO PUT SO

02:39:51.315 --> 02:39:54.752 region:rollup2
MUCH MONEY AND READ SOME

02:39:53.017 --> 02:39:55.853 region:rollup2

DIFFERENTLY TO TO ADDRESS THAT.

02:40:05.496 --> 02:40:08.265 region:rollup2
MONEY ISSUE AND ALSO WHEN

02:40:07.631 --> 02:40:10.334 region:rollup2
POTENTIALLY STUDENTS WANT TO GO

02:40:08.265 --> 02:40:10.968 region:rollup2
TO CLASS.

02:40:10.334 --> 02:40:12.970 region:rollup2
PUPPY OUT START A KNOW THAT.

02:40:10.968 --> 02:40:13.904 region:rollup2
ONE STRATEGY THAT SEVERAL OF

02:40:12.970 --> 02:40:15.473 region:rollup2
OUR CAMPUSES HAVE BEGUN TO

02:40:13.904 --> 02:40:17.475 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENT A LOOKING AT.

02:40:15.473 --> 02:40:19.210 region:rollup2
SPACE UTILIZATION.

02:40:17.475 --> 02:40:21.879 region:rollup2
AND CONDUCTING STUDIES TO

02:40:19.210 --> 02:40:22.580 region:rollup2
DETERMINE EXACTLY WHERE THE GAPS

02:40:21.879 --> 02:40:24.482 region:rollup2
ARE.

02:40:22.580 --> 02:40:25.749 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF CLASSROOMS THAT ARE

02:40:24.482 --> 02:40:28.018 region:rollup2
NOT BEING USED

02:40:25.749 --> 02:40:29.687 region:rollup2
AND THEN USING THAT THEN TO WORK

02:40:28.018 --> 02:40:31.989 region:rollup2
WITH THE VARIOUS ACADEMIC

02:40:29.687 --> 02:40:34.458 region:rollup2
COLLEGE IS. A TO RETHINK THEIR

02:40:31.989 --> 02:40:36.427 region:rollup2
TRADITIONAL NINE TO THREE ARE

02:40:34.458 --> 02:40:38.729 region:rollup2
NINE TO FIVE STRUCTURE THAT WE

02:40:36.427 --> 02:40:40.731 region:rollup2
HAVE IN PLACE TO OFFER COURSES.

02:40:38.729 --> 02:40:42.333 region:rollup2
AND PROVIDE INCENTIVES FOR

02:40:40.731 --> 02:40:43.934 region:rollup2
FACULTY WHO WISH THEN OUGHT TO

02:40:42.333 --> 02:40:46.070 region:rollup2
OFFER COURSES PERHAPS IN THE

02:40:43.934 --> 02:40:47.371 region:rollup2
LATER EVENING ON WEEKENDS A AND

02:40:46.070 --> 02:40:49.573 region:rollup2
THAT MORE IMPORTANTLY IN

02:40:47.371 --> 02:40:51.542 region:rollup2
SURVEYING STUDENTS. DETERMINING

02:40:49.573 --> 02:40:53.878 region:rollup2
BASED ON MANY OF THEM WORKING IN

02:40:51.542 --> 02:40:56.914 region:rollup2
THEIR SCHEDULES WHAT COULD BE

02:40:53.878 --> 02:40:58.582 region:rollup2
MORE TIME SLOTS THAT GO BEYOND

02:40:56.914 --> 02:41:00.084 region:rollup2
THEIR TRADITIONAL TIME FRAME OF

02:40:58.582 --> 02:41:01.218 region:rollup2
THE COURSES CAN BE OFFERED AND

02:41:00.084 --> 02:41:02.353 region:rollup2
THAT FACULTY WILL DELIVER THOSE

02:41:01.218 --> 02:41:05.122 region:rollup2
COURSES.

02:41:02.353 --> 02:41:06.991 region:rollup2
WE SEE CHANGES HAPPENING.

02:41:05.122 --> 02:41:07.191 region:rollup2
AT SAN MARCOS A AS A RESULT O

02:41:06.991 --> 02:41:08.792 region:rollup2
THAT.

02:41:07.191 --> 02:41:09.760 region:rollup2
AND WE CERTAINLY ANTICIPATE

02:41:08.792 --> 02:41:11.862 region:rollup2
THAT WE'RE GOING TO SEE OTHER

02:41:09.760 --> 02:41:13.164 region:rollup2
CHANGES AS WELL BASED ON A

02:41:11.862 --> 02:41:14.598 region:rollup2
GROWING NUMBER BY CAMPUS IS

02:41:13.164 --> 02:41:16.400 region:rollup2
CONDUCTING THE SPACE UTILIZATION

02:41:14.598 --> 02:41:19.236 region:rollup2
STUDIES.

02:41:16.400 --> 02:41:22.139 region:rollup2
THAT'S ONE EXAMPLE OKAY.

02:41:19.236 --> 02:41:23.674 region:rollup2
AND AND THEN UST YEAH I KNOW

02:41:22.139 --> 02:41:25.409 region:rollup2
THAT. WHEN GIVEN A GREATER

02:41:23.674 --> 02:41:27.545 region:rollup2
DETAIL DURING THE BUDGET

02:41:25.409 --> 02:41:29.079 region:rollup2
HEARINGS I WANTED. IF TAKE UP

02:41:27.545 --> 02:41:29.313 region:rollup2
TOO MUCH TIME TODAY BUT AS FAR

02:41:29.079 --> 02:41:30.714 region:rollup2
AS THE.

02:41:29.313 --> 02:41:33.717 region:rollup2
THE GRADUATION INITIATIVES I

02:41:30.714 --> 02:41:34.251 region:rollup2
THINK FANTASTIC WORK YOU ALL ARE

02:41:33.717 --> 02:41:36.086 region:rollup2
DOING.

02:41:34.251 --> 02:41:36.754 region:rollup2
.

02:41:36.086 --> 02:41:37.721 region:rollup2
I SEE IT RIGHT HERE AT C. S. U.

02:41:36.754 --> 02:41:38.622 region:rollup2
S..

02:41:37.721 --> 02:41:40.591 region:rollup2
SO IF YOU CAN LOOK AROUND AT THE

02:41:38.622 --> 02:41:41.725 region:rollup2
MACRO LEVEL.

02:41:40.591 --> 02:41:43.661 region:rollup2
WHAT WERE THE BIGGEST TAKEAWAY

02:41:41.725 --> 02:41:44.261 region:rollup2
CC FOR FIRST COUPLE YEARS

02:41:43.661 --> 02:41:45.930 region:rollup2
AS FAR AS THE MOST EFFECTIVE

02:41:44.261 --> 02:41:48.599 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT?

02:41:45.930 --> 02:41:50.100 region:rollup2
TWENTY FIVE CAMPUS WIDE HEARD

02:41:48.599 --> 02:41:51.936 region:rollup2
WHATEVER NEVER IS IS DOING.

02:41:50.100 --> 02:41:53.804 region:rollup2
AND THAT WE COULD DO MORE OUT.

02:41:51.936 --> 02:41:56.106 region:rollup2
WELL GOOD QUESTION.

02:41:53.804 --> 02:41:58.309 region:rollup2
I WOULD SAY THAT.

02:41:56.106 --> 02:41:59.543 region:rollup2
WHAT WE'RE LEARNING NOW AND

02:41:58.309 --> 02:42:00.277 region:rollup2
WHAT'S GOING TO BE THAT THE THE

02:41:59.543 --> 02:42:02.913 region:rollup2
BIGGEST TAKE WAY FOR US

02:42:00.277 --> 02:42:04.381 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY AS WE ARE? WORKING TO

02:42:02.913 --> 02:42:06.650 region:rollup2
CLOSE THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP.

02:42:04.381 --> 02:42:08.519 region:rollup2
<u><c.green>IT'S GOING TO BE THE</c></u>

02:42:06.650 --> 02:42:10.554 region:rollup2
RESTRUCTURING OF THE DEVELOPMENT

02:42:08.519 --> 02:42:12.289 region:rollup2
EDUCATION PROGRAM WHICH WE HAVE

02:42:10.554 --> 02:42:14.325 region:rollup2
LAID THE FOUNDATION FOR THAT TO

02:42:12.289 --> 02:42:17.127 region:rollup2
OCCUR. AND THAT WE HAVE SEEN

02:42:14.325 --> 02:42:19.196 region:rollup2
RESULTS ALREADY IN ENGLISH OF

02:42:17.127 --> 02:42:21.031 region:rollup2
WHERE OF A LOT OF THOSE COURSES

02:42:19.196 --> 02:42:22.199 region:rollup2
THAT WERE NON CREDIT BEARING.

02:42:21.031 --> 02:42:24.068 region:rollup2
THAT ENGLISH FACULTY HAVE

02:42:22.199 --> 02:42:25.603 region:rollup2
CONVERTED THOSE OVER ALREADY

02:42:24.068 --> 02:42:27.304 region:rollup2
INTO CREDIT BEARING COURSES.

02:42:25.603 --> 02:42:29.640 region:rollup2
AND WE'RE SEEING STUDENTS

02:42:27.304 --> 02:42:31.208 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY GRADUATING I IN A

02:42:29.640 --> 02:42:33.277 region:rollup2
TIMELY MANNER OBVIOUSLY

02:42:31.208 --> 02:42:34.812 region:rollup2
MATHEMATICS HAS BEEN THE BIGGEST

02:42:33.277 --> 02:42:36.547 region:rollup2
BARRIER.

02:42:34.812 --> 02:42:37.715 region:rollup2
NOT ONLY FOR US IT'S THE ISSUE

02:42:36.547 --> 02:42:38.582 region:rollup2
BUT IF YOU LOOK ACROSS THE

02:42:37.715 --> 02:42:40.317 region:rollup2
NATION.

02:42:38.582 --> 02:42:42.720 region:rollup2
IT HAD MATHEMATICS PERFORMANCE

02:42:40.317 --> 02:42:43.821 region:rollup2
HAS BEEN A STRUGGLE FOR A NUMBER

02:42:42.720 --> 02:42:45.489 region:rollup2
OF STUDENTS ESPECIALLY FOR

02:42:43.821 --> 02:42:49.727 region:rollup2
STUDENTS OF COLOR. AND SO THE

02:42:45.489 --> 02:42:51.395 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTATION THEN OF THAT SAME

02:42:49.727 --> 02:42:53.430 region:rollup2
CO REQUISITE MODEL FOR

02:42:51.395 --> 02:42:56.533 region:rollup2
MATHEMATICS OF THAT WERE IN THE

02:42:53.430 --> 02:42:57.968 region:rollup2
PROCESS OF IMPERFECT OF. OF

02:42:56.533 --> 02:42:59.803 region:rollup2
FINALIZING NOW FOR

02:42:57.968 --> 02:43:02.706 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTATION AND FALL TWENTY

02:42:59.803 --> 02:43:05.409 region:rollup2
EIGHTEEN I CAN SAY TO YOU THAT

02:43:02.706 --> 02:43:07.845 region:rollup2
WE BELIEVE WILL MOVE THE NEEDLE

02:43:05.409 --> 02:43:10.814 region:rollup2
VERY SIGNIFICANTLY.

02:43:07.845 --> 02:43:13.117 region:rollup2
AS IT RELATES TO ALLOWING MORE

02:43:10.814 --> 02:43:15.052 region:rollup2
STUDENTS AND IT AND PARTICULARLY

02:43:13.117 --> 02:43:18.689 region:rollup2
MORE STUDENTS OF COLOR.

02:43:15.052 --> 02:43:20.658 region:rollup2
TO BE ABLE TO GRADUATE AND I'M

02:43:18.689 --> 02:43:24.495 region:rollup2
AN A TIMELIER MANNER AND MORE

02:43:20.658 --> 02:43:26.597 region:rollup2
IMPORTANTLY OF BE PREPARED.

02:43:24.495 --> 02:43:29.466 region:rollup2
AT IT WITH THE SAME LEVEL OF

02:43:26.597 --> 02:43:32.803 region:rollup2
QUALITY THAT WE WOULD ANTICIPATE

02:43:29.466 --> 02:43:33.871 region:rollup2
OTHER STUDENTS COMPLETING AND

02:43:32.803 --> 02:43:35.372 region:rollup2
BEING READY FOR THE WORKFORCE

02:43:33.871 --> 02:43:37.074 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S ONE OF THE ONE OF THE

02:43:35.372 --> 02:43:37.541 region:rollup2
TAKEOVER TAKEAWAYS. THE OTHER IS

02:43:37.074 --> 02:43:38.909 region:rollup2
OF REALLY LOOKING VERY

02:43:37.541 --> 02:43:40.310 region:rollup2
CAREFULLY.

02:43:38.909 --> 02:43:40.978 region:rollup2
AT HOW STUDENTS REALLY ARE

02:43:40.310 --> 02:43:42.446 region:rollup2
PROGRESSING.

02:43:40.978 --> 02:43:43.347 region:rollup2
IT'S IT'S TYING IN WITH THE

02:43:42.446 --> 02:43:44.214 region:rollup2
DATA DRIVEN KIND OF WORK THAT WE

02:43:43.347 --> 02:43:45.449 region:rollup2
HAVE TO DO TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC INEQUITIES.

02:46:52.135 --> 02:46:54.972 region:rollup2
AS THESE GOALS INDICATE TRANSFER

TO ACHIEVE THESE GOALS

02:47:01.278 --> 02:47:04.047 region:rollup2
THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE IS

02:47:02.112 --> 02:47:05.182 region:rollup2
COMMITTED TO SEVERAL MAJOR

02:47:04.047 --> 02:47:07.050 region:rollup2
DIRECTIONS THAT WE BELIEVE WILL

02:47:05.182 --> 02:47:08.819 region:rollup2
HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT.

02:47:07.050 --> 02:47:11.054 region:rollup2
ON OUR CURRENT STUDENTS AND ALSO

02:47:08.819 --> 02:47:12.489 region:rollup2
CULTIVATE SUCCESS AMONG STUDENTS

02:47:11.054 --> 02:47:14.625 region:rollup2
WHO HAVE NOT YET FOUND THEIR WAY

02:47:12.489 --> 02:47:15.859 region:rollup2
TO OUR DOORS.

02:47:14.625 --> 02:47:17.160 region:rollup2
THESE EMERGING DIRECTIONS

02:47:15.859 --> 02:47:19.496 region:rollup2
INCLUDE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF

02:47:17.160 --> 02:47:20.931 region:rollup2
GUIDED PATHWAYS STATEWIDE IN THE

02:47:19.496 --> 02:47:22.466 region:rollup2
NEXT FIVE YEARS AND HEARD A

02:47:20.931 --> 02:47:23.333 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT ABOUT GUIDED PATHWAYS

02:47:22.466 --> 02:47:26.036 region:rollup2
ALREADY FROM SOME OF OUR

02:47:23.333 --> 02:47:27.538 region:rollup2
PREVIOUS SPEAKERS.

02:47:26.036 --> 02:47:28.338 region:rollup2
THE OTHER ADDITIONAL DIRECTIONS

02:47:27.538 --> 02:47:29.773 region:rollup2
THAT WE THINK WE'LL HAVE A

02:47:28.338 --> 02:47:31.275 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT IMPACT INCLUDE THE

02:47:29.773 --> 02:47:33.310 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTATION OF A NEW FUNDING

02:47:31.275 --> 02:47:35.279 region:rollup2
FORMULA. AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF

02:47:33.310 --> 02:47:36.780 region:rollup2
A NEW ONLINE COLLEGE.

02:47:35.279 --> 02:47:38.448 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY FOCUSED ON STRANDED

02:47:36.780 --> 02:47:41.251 region:rollup2
WORKERS WHO ARE NOT CURRENTLY

02:47:38.448 --> 02:47:42.619 region:rollup2
ENROLLED IN OUR SYSTEM.

02:47:41.251 --> 02:47:44.154 region:rollup2
THESE ARE ENORMOUS GOALS THAT

02:47:42.619 --> 02:47:45.355 region:rollup2
RICK WILL REQUIRE TIME AND

02:47:44.154 --> 02:47:47.424 region:rollup2
SUSTAINED COMMITMENT ON GOING

02:47:45.355 --> 02:47:48.158 region:rollup2
IMPROVEMENT.

02:47:47.424 --> 02:47:48.692 region:rollup2
SO LET ME START WITH A LITTLE

02:47:48.158 --> 02:47:50.661 region:rollup2
EXPLANATION ABOUT GUIDED

02:47:48.692 --> 02:47:52.763 region:rollup2
PATHWAYS.

02:47:50.661 --> 02:47:55.232 region:rollup2
VERY PATHWAYS IS A FRAMEWORK

02:47:52.763 --> 02:47:56.567 region:rollup2
NOT A PROGRAM NOT AN INITIATIVE

02:47:55.232 --> 02:47:57.568 region:rollup2
BUT A REENGINEERING OF THE

02:47:56.567 --> 02:47:59.403 region:rollup2
STUDENT EXPERIENCE AT THE

02:47:57.568 --> 02:48:01.004 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY COLLEGE.

02:47:59.403 --> 02:48:03.507 region:rollup2
IS BASED ON A NATIONAL MODEL AND

02:48:01.004 --> 02:48:05.342 region:rollup2
REFUTE REFER FUELED BY REFORM

02:48:03.507 --> 02:48:06.443 region:rollup2
MOVEMENTS THAT ARE EVIDENCE

02:48:05.342 --> 02:48:07.544 region:rollup2
BASED APPROACHES THAT KEEP

02:48:06.443 --> 02:48:09.079 region:rollup2
STUDENTS OF THE ORGANIZATIONAL

02:48:07.544 --> 02:48:11.848 region:rollup2
CENTER.

02:48:09.079 --> 02:48:13.016 region:rollup2
OF OF THE COLLEGE PROCESS.

02:48:11.848 --> 02:48:15.052 region:rollup2
THE GUIDED PATHWAYS FRAMEWORK

02:48:13.016 --> 02:48:16.586 region:rollup2
FEATURES FOUR PILLARS.

02:48:15.052 --> 02:48:18.422 region:rollup2
THE FIRST IN MANY WAYS FOR THE

02:48:16.586 --> 02:48:20.090 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY COLLEGE AT LEAST IS

02:48:18.422 --> 02:48:21.625 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE MOST CHALLENGING. AND

02:48:20.090 --> 02:48:24.294 region:rollup2
THAT IS CLARIFYING THE PATH.

02:48:21.625 --> 02:48:25.896 region:rollup2
THAT STUDENTS WILL TAKE.

02:48:24.294 --> 02:48:26.964 region:rollup2
AS WAS MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY ONE

02:48:25.896 --> 02:48:28.465 region:rollup2
OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE BUILT

02:48:26.964 --> 02:48:30.067 region:rollup2
IN CALIFORNIA IS A WONDERFUL

02:48:28.465 --> 02:48:31.735 region:rollup2
SYSTEM THAT PROVIDES TREMENDOUS

02:48:30.067 --> 02:48:33.804 region:rollup2
ACCESS BUT IT IS ALSO EXTREMELY

02:48:31.735 --> 02:48:35.072 region:rollup2
COMPLICATED.

02:48:33.804 --> 02:48:36.573 region:rollup2
ON ONE OF THE THINGS I COULD

02:48:35.072 --> 02:48:38.208 region:rollup2
TELL YOU ANECDOTALLY I COME FROM

02:48:36.573 --> 02:48:39.309 region:rollup2
THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM AND

02:48:38.208 --> 02:48:41.345 region:rollup2
WE INLAND EMPIRE.

02:48:39.309 --> 02:48:42.679 region:rollup2
AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE

02:48:41.345 --> 02:48:44.448 region:rollup2
NOTED IS THAT.

02:48:42.679 --> 02:48:46.149 region:rollup2
A NUMBER OF OUR STUDENTS

02:48:44.448 --> 02:48:47.317 region:rollup2
COME UNDECIDED AND THEY ALSO

02:48:46.149 --> 02:48:48.719 region:rollup2
HAVE A VERY DIFFICULT TIME

02:48:47.317 --> 02:48:49.987 region:rollup2
FOLLOWING A PROGRAM MAP BECAUSE

02:48:48.719 --> 02:48:51.822 region:rollup2
THERE MAY ONLY BE ONE OR TWO

02:48:49.987 --> 02:48:52.322 region:rollup2
COURSES DIFFERENCE.

02:48:51.822 --> 02:48:54.558 region:rollup2
IN FIVE OR SIX BUSINESS

02:48:52.322 --> 02:48:56.026 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS.

02:48:54.558 --> 02:48:57.561 region:rollup2
SO ONE OF THE OUR JOBS WITH

02:48:56.026 --> 02:48:59.262 region:rollup2
CLARIFYING THE PATH IS MAKING

02:48:57.561 --> 02:49:01.098 region:rollup2
SURE THAT WE CREATE CONDITIONS

02:48:59.262 --> 02:49:03.266 region:rollup2
FOR THE FACULTY.

02:49:01.098 --> 02:49:05.702 region:rollup2
TO CREATE MORE CLARIFIED PROGRAM

02:49:03.266 --> 02:49:07.204 region:rollup2
MAPS FOR STUDENTS TO FOLLOW.

02:49:05.702 --> 02:49:08.639 region:rollup2
SO THAT THEY CAN MORE CLEARLY

02:49:07.204 --> 02:49:10.107 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND WHAT IT IS THAT THEY

02:49:08.639 --> 02:49:13.844 region:rollup2
NEED TO TAKE AND DO SO MORE

02:49:10.107 --> 02:49:14.845 region:rollup2
EFFICIENTLY.

02:49:13.844 --> 02:49:16.046 region:rollup2
SINCE MANY OF OUR STUDENTS ARE

02:49:14.845 --> 02:49:18.248 region:rollup2
FIRST GENERATION.

02:49:16.046 --> 02:49:19.950 region:rollup2
WE WANT TO PROVIDE OUR STUDENTS

02:49:18.248 --> 02:49:21.451 region:rollup2
WITH RELENTLESS CLARITY THAT'S

02:49:19.950 --> 02:49:23.687 region:rollup2
NEEDED TO SUPPORT THE SUCCESSFUL

02:49:21.451 --> 02:49:24.788 region:rollup2
NAVIGATION OF OUR SYSTEM.

02:49:23.687 --> 02:49:27.491 region:rollup2
THAT AS I MENTIONED HAS BECOME

02:49:24.788 --> 02:49:29.459 region:rollup2
UNNECESSARILY COMPLEX.

02:49:27.491 --> 02:49:30.761 region:rollup2

02:50:40.263 --> 02:50:42.966 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO ASSURE

02:50:41.264 --> 02:50:44.668 region:rollup2

AN ISSUE THAT GUIDED PATHWAYS

MORE SYSTEMATIC WORK HOWEVER

02:53:03.039 --> 02:53:05.575 region:rollup2
NEEDS TO BE DONE TO CONTINUE TO

02:53:04.207 --> 02:53:07.644 region:rollup2
SUPPORT CALIFORNIA'S HIGHER

02:53:07.644 --> 02:53:10.513 region:rollup2
A NEW FUNDING FORMULA HAS BEEN

02:53:08.845 --> 02:53:12.916 region:rollup2
PROPOSED ONE THAT WOULD HELP

02:53:10.513 --> 02:53:14.217 region:rollup2
STABILIZE FUNDING RATES LOCALLY

02:53:12.916 --> 02:53:16.286 region:rollup2
PROVIDE ADDITIONAL SUPPORT

ACHIEVEMENT.

02:53:20.724 --> 02:53:23.059 region:rollup2
THE CURRENT FUNDING MODEL IS

02:53:21.625 --> 02:53:24.661 region:rollup2
SOLELY BASED ON STUDENT

02:53:23.059 --> 02:53:27.063 region:rollup2
ENROLLMENT AND GROWTH AND IT

02:53:24.661 --> 02:53:28.365 region:rollup2
SHARPLY PENALIZES COLLEGES WHEN

02:53:27.063 --> 02:53:30.333 region:rollup2
THE ECONOMY SHIFTS AND GROWTH IS

02:53:28.365 --> 02:53:32.269 region:rollup2
MORE DIFFICULT.

02:53:30.333 --> 02:53:33.403 region:rollup2
WITHOUT GROWTH DOLLARS OR COLA

02:53:32.269 --> 02:53:34.905 region:rollup2
COLLEGES DO NOT HAVE A

02:53:33.403 --> 02:53:36.373 region:rollup2
SYSTEMATIC WAY TO CULTIVATE

02:53:34.905 --> 02:53:37.340 region:rollup2
FUNDING INCREASES TO MEET THE

02:53:36.373 --> 02:53:39.175 region:rollup2
CHANGING NEEDS OF THEIR STUDENT

02:53:37.340 --> 02:53:40.644 region:rollup2
BODY.

02:53:39.175 --> 02:53:43.113 region:rollup2
WITH A MORE BALANCED APPROACH TO

02:53:40.644 --> 02:53:45.749 region:rollup2
FUNDING THAT INCORPORATES.

02:53:43.113 --> 02:53:46.916 region:rollup2
THREE DIFFERENT LEGS WE THINK

02:53:45.749 --> 02:53:48.351 region:rollup2
THAT UP COLLEGES WILL HAVE THE

02:53:46.916 --> 02:53:48.952 region:rollup2
FLEXIBILITY THAT THEY NEED IN

02:53:48.351 --> 02:53:52.222 region:rollup2
ORDER TO INNOVATE AND SUPPORT

02:53:48.952 --> 02:53:53.456 region:rollup2
THEIR STUDENTS.

02:53:52.222 --> 02:53:55.258 region:rollup2
THE DETAILS OF HOW THE FUNDING

02:53:53.456 --> 02:53:56.826 region:rollup2
FORMULA WILL SPECIFICALLY WORK

02:53:55.258 --> 02:53:58.028 region:rollup2
ARE BEING DISCUSSED NOW AND

02:53:56.826 --> 02:53:59.362 region:rollup2
CHANCER OAKLEY HAS ASKED THE

02:53:58.028 --> 02:54:00.830 region:rollup2
PRESIDENTS AND CHANCELLORS TO

02:53:59.362 --> 02:54:03.800 region:rollup2
TAKE THE LEAD ON DEVELOPING THE

02:54:00.830 --> 02:54:05.302 region:rollup2
SPECIFICS OF THE MODEL.

02:54:03.800 --> 02:54:06.369 region:rollup2
FINALLY THE BUDGET INCLUDES A

02:54:05.302 --> 02:54:08.505 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL FOR A NEW ONLINE

02:54:06.369 --> 02:54:10.006 region:rollup2
COLLEGE.

02:54:08.505 --> 02:54:11.775 region:rollup2
BOTH THE GOVERNOR AND CHANCER

02:54:10.006 --> 02:54:13.410 region:rollup2
OAKLEY ARE FORWARD THINKING AND

02:54:11.775 --> 02:54:14.244 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT WAYS THAT THE CURRENT

02:54:13.410 --> 02:54:16.179 region:rollup2
SYSTEM CAN ADDRESS NEEDS OF

02:54:14.244 --> 02:54:18.248 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIANS. WHO ARE NOT

02:54:16.179 --> 02:54:20.283 region:rollup2
ALREADY BEING SERVED?

02:54:18.248 --> 02:54:21.384 region:rollup2
CURRENT LABOR RESEARCH PAINTS A

02:54:20.283 --> 02:54:23.086 region:rollup2
DIM PICTURE OF THE ECONOMIC

02:54:21.384 --> 02:54:25.388 region:rollup2
STABILITY OF CALIFORNIANS WITH

02:54:23.086 --> 02:54:26.589 region:rollup2
LITTLE OR NO COLLEGE EDUCATION.

02:54:25.388 --> 02:54:28.425 region:rollup2
AND YET THAT IS THE SITUATION

02:54:26.589 --> 02:54:30.126 region:rollup2
FOR TOO MANY.

02:54:28.425 --> 02:54:31.795 region:rollup2
AS THE DEMANDS FOR JOB SKILLS

02:54:30.126 --> 02:54:33.663 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO GROW AND CHANGE

02:54:31.795 --> 02:54:35.565 region:rollup2
THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE NEEDS TO

02:54:33.663 --> 02:54:37.033 region:rollup2
DYNAMICALLY MEET THOSE NEEDS.

02:54:35.565 --> 02:54:38.301 region:rollup2
AND ALSO PROVIDE ACCESS TO

02:54:37.033 --> 02:54:40.303 region:rollup2
WORKERS WHO ARE IN MANY WAYS

02:54:38.301 --> 02:54:41.604 region:rollup2
STRANDED.

02:54:40.303 --> 02:54:43.573 region:rollup2
STRANDED BECAUSE THEIR WORK

02:54:41.604 --> 02:54:44.874 region:rollup2
SCHEDULES ARE CONDITIONS LIMIT

02:54:43.573 --> 02:54:45.642 region:rollup2
THEIR CAPACITY TO ATTEND A

02:54:44.874 --> 02:54:48.478 region:rollup2
TRADITIONAL BRICK AND MORTAR

02:54:45.642 --> 02:54:51.548 region:rollup2
COLLEGE.

02:54:48.478 --> 02:54:51.548 region:rollup2
STRANDED BY TRADITIONAL

02:54:51.614 --> 02:54:54.884 region:rollup2
ENOUGH FLEXIBLE OPPORTUNITY. AND

02:54:53.717 --> 02:54:56.419 region:rollup2
STRANDED BY A DEFINITION OF

02:54:54.884 --> 02:54:58.288 region:rollup2
EDUCATION THE DOES NOT FLEX

02:54:56.419 --> 02:55:00.156 region:rollup2
OPTIONS FOR SUB AWARDS OR MICRO

02:54:58.288 --> 02:55:00.924 region:rollup2
CREDENTIALS.

02:55:00.156 --> 02:55:02.392 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD BOOST EARNING

DOLLARS.

03:00:57.780 --> 03:01:00.650 region:rollup2
EVEN THAT TOTAL THOUGH DOES NOT

03:00:59.449 --> 03:01:01.851 region:rollup2
REPRESENT THE TOTAL FACILITIES

03:01:00.650 --> 03:01:03.853 region:rollup2
NEED FOR THE COLLEGES AND AS

03:01:01.851 --> 03:01:04.854 region:rollup2
WE'VE REPORTED BEFORE OUR OFFICE

03:01:03.853 --> 03:01:05.822 region:rollup2
ESTIMATES THAT THERE'S MORE THAN

03:01:04.854 --> 03:01:07.223 region:rollup2
ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN

COLLEGES AS A RESPONSIBILITY

03:01:13.463 --> 03:01:15.798 region:rollup2
THAT'S BEEN SHARED BY THE STATE

03:01:14.864 --> 03:01:17.633 region:rollup2
AND LET ME GO TO COLLEGE

03:01:15.798 --> 03:01:18.601 region:rollup2
DISTRICTS.

03:01:17.633 --> 03:01:19.669 region:rollup2
AND WE CAN ACCOUNT FOR THAT IN

03:01:18.601 --> 03:01:21.104 region:rollup2
OUR PLANNING PROCESSES BY

03:01:19.669 --> 03:01:22.205 region:rollup2
ESTIMATING THAT ABOUT FORTY

03:01:21.104 --> 03:01:24.774 region:rollup2
PERCENT OF THE NEED.

03:01:22.205 --> 03:01:26.109 region:rollup2
IS ADDRESS WITH LOCAL FUNDS.

03:01:24.774 --> 03:01:28.111 region:rollup2
I AFTER ACCOUNTING FOR THE LOCAL

03:01:26.109 --> 03:01:29.512 region:rollup2
FUNDS AND PROPERTY ONE BOND

03:01:28.111 --> 03:01:30.980 region:rollup2
FUNDS WE ESTIMATE THAT OUR PLAN

03:01:29.512 --> 03:01:32.482 region:rollup2
THE FEW REMAINING NEED OF STATE

03:01:30.980 --> 03:01:34.484 region:rollup2

AS THE CHAIR NOTED.

03:01:35.885 --> 03:01:38.421 region:rollup2
WE'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT

03:01:37.186 --> 03:01:39.922 region:rollup2
ALTERNATIVE WAYS TO MEET

03:01:38.421 --> 03:01:41.791 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS ALL

03:01:39.922 --> 03:01:43.826 region:rollup2
HIGHLIGHT TO THE FIRST IS ON

03:01:41.791 --> 03:01:45.328 region:rollup2
YEAR ROUND INSTRUCTION. IN THAT

03:01:43.826 --> 03:01:46.863 region:rollup2
REPORT YOU'LL SEE A STATISTIC

03:01:45.328 --> 03:01:47.964 region:rollup2
THAT SAYS OVER THE PAST TWENTY

03:01:46.863 --> 03:01:49.932 region:rollup2
YEARS THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF DAYS

03:01:47.964 --> 03:01:51.768 region:rollup2
OF INSTRUCTION. HAS INCREASED BY

03:01:49.932 --> 03:01:52.735 region:rollup2
TWENTY THREE DAYS FROM TWO

03:01:51.768 --> 03:01:55.037 region:rollup2
HUNDRED SEVENTY ONE DAYS TO

TUTOR AT NINETY FOUR DAYS.

03:01:55.037 --> 03:01:57.840 region:rollup2
AND THAT WE KNOW ONLINE

03:01:56.172 --> 03:01:59.142 region:rollup2
EDUCATION WILL HAVE IMPACTS ON

03:01:57.840 --> 03:02:00.276 region:rollup2
OUR CAPITAL PLANNING AND SO WE

03:01:59.142 --> 03:02:02.478 region:rollup2
MAKE ASSUMPTIONS.

03:02:00.276 --> 03:02:03.546 region:rollup2
THAT WE UPSET ABOUT TEN PERCENT

03:02:02.478 --> 03:02:05.448 region:rollup2
OF THE NEED TO TRY TO ACCOUNT

03:02:03.546 --> 03:02:06.883 region:rollup2
FOR THAT IMPACT.

03:02:05.448 --> 03:02:08.284 region:rollup2
BUT IN THE IMMEDIATE TERM OUR

03:02:06.883 --> 03:02:09.285 region:rollup2
HIGHEST PRIORITY IN THIS AREA

03:02:08.284 --> 03:02:10.453 region:rollup2
SECURING FUNDING FOR THE

03:02:09.285 --> 03:02:12.188 region:rollup2

BUDGET REQUEST.

03:02:12.188 --> 03:02:14.090 region:rollup2
AND SO FOR EIGHTEEN NINETEEN WE

03:02:13.756 --> 03:02:15.725 region:rollup2
HAD REQUESTED.

03:02:14.090 --> 03:02:15.925 region:rollup2
.

03:02:15.725 --> 03:02:17.927 region:rollup2
THAT.

03:02:15.925 --> 03:02:19.829 region:rollup2
THIRTY THREE PROJECTS BE FUNDED

03:02:17.927 --> 03:02:21.431 region:rollup2
FIFTEEN CONTINUING PROJECTS

03:02:19.829 --> 03:02:22.932 region:rollup2
EIGHTEEN NEW STAR PROJECTS.

OF THOSE PROJECTS AND SO WERE

03:02:24.567 --> 03:02:26.702 region:rollup2
WORKING WE PLAN TO WORK WITH THE

03:02:25.802 --> 03:02:28.504 region:rollup2

THIS PROCESS.

03:02:32.542 --> 03:02:35.044 region:rollup2
AND OVER THE LONGER TERM WE HOPE

03:02:33.976 --> 03:02:36.646 region:rollup2
TO HAVE A DISCUSSION ABOUT HOW

03:02:35.044 --> 03:02:37.113 region:rollup2
TO BEST MEET PIC COLLEGES

03:02:36.646 --> 03:02:38.481 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS.

03:02:37.113 --> 03:02:39.949 region:rollup2
.

03:02:38.481 --> 03:02:41.083 region:rollup2
BY NECESSITY WE CREATE THESE

03:02:39.949 --> 03:02:42.552 region:rollup2
CAPITAL PLANS BY PROJECTING OUR

03:02:41.083 --> 03:02:43.820 region:rollup2
CURRENT TRENDS.

03:02:42.552 --> 03:02:45.388 region:rollup2
BUT THE POINT OF THE VISION OF

03:02:43.820 --> 03:02:47.089 region:rollup2
SPUR SUCCESS IN OF THIS HEARING

03:02:45.388 --> 03:02:48.691 region:rollup2
IS THAT MORE DRAMATIC CHANGE IS

03:02:47.089 --> 03:02:50.159 region:rollup2
NEEDED. AND SO AS WE MADE OUR

03:02:48.691 --> 03:02:51.561 region:rollup2
MOVE FORWARD WE HOPE WE CAN WORK

03:02:50.159 --> 03:02:53.162 region:rollup2
WITH YOU TO CONSIDER SOME

03:02:51.561 --> 03:02:55.131 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS HOW BEST ABOUT STATE

03:02:53.162 --> 03:02:56.499 region:rollup2
LOCAL ROLES. HOW DO YOU TARGET

03:02:55.131 --> 03:02:58.334 region:rollup2
RESOURCES TO THE DISTRICTS THAT

03:02:56.499 --> 03:02:59.669 region:rollup2
HAVE UNIQUE NEEDS AND HOW DO YOU

03:02:58.334 --> 03:03:00.937 region:rollup2
STRUCTURE INCENTIVES IN THE WAIT

03:02:59.669 --> 03:03:01.838 region:rollup2
FOR DISTRICTS TO THINK ABOUT

03:03:00.937 --> 03:03:05.174 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE CONSISTENT WITH

03:03:01.838 --> 03:03:06.676 region:rollup2
THE STATE CALLS?

03:03:05.174 --> 03:03:08.511 region:rollup2
SO JUST CAN TO CONCLUDE ARE A

03:03:06.676 --> 03:03:10.213 region:rollup2
FEW CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES

03:03:08.511 --> 03:03:11.247 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY THE SIZE OF OUR SYSTEM

03:03:10.213 --> 03:03:12.515 region:rollup2
WOULD TWO POINT THREE MILLION

03:03:11.247 --> 03:03:14.450 region:rollup2
STUDENTS.

03:03:12.515 --> 03:03:16.152 region:rollup2
CREATES BOTH A CHALLENGE AND AN

03:03:14.450 --> 03:03:17.753 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY IN THE SENSE THAT WE

03:03:16.152 --> 03:03:18.688 region:rollup2
HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY IMPACT.

03:03:17.753 --> 03:03:19.689 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF

03:03:18.688 --> 03:03:21.824 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIANS.

03:03:19.689 --> 03:03:23.526 region:rollup2
BUT ALSO IT'S A COMPLEX SYSTEM

03:03:21.824 --> 03:03:25.661 region:rollup2
GIVEN ITS SIZE.

03:03:23.526 --> 03:03:26.996 region:rollup2
SOME OTHER MORE A MORE GRANULAR

03:03:25.661 --> 03:03:28.698 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES INCLUDE.

03:03:26.996 --> 03:03:30.700 region:rollup2
IDENTIFYING ACTING UPON

03:03:28.698 --> 03:03:33.169 region:rollup2
SEGMENTAL BARRIERS WITH BOTH K.

03:03:30.700 --> 03:03:34.670 region:rollup2
TWELVE AND UNIVERSITY PARTNERS.

03:03:33.169 --> 03:03:36.239 region:rollup2
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

03:03:34.670 --> 03:03:37.673 region:rollup2
STUDENTS MOVE MORE SEAMLESSLY

03:03:36.239 --> 03:03:39.308 region:rollup2
THROUGH OUR SYSTEM AND ONE OF

03:03:37.673 --> 03:03:41.511 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT WOULD HELP THAT IS.

03:03:39.308 --> 03:03:42.545 region:rollup2
AS WAS MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY OF

03:03:41.511 --> 03:03:45.014 region:rollup2
BETTER ATTENTION TO DATA

03:03:42.545 --> 03:03:46.415 region:rollup2
COLLECTION AND DATA SHARING. IT

03:03:45.014 --> 03:03:48.651 region:rollup2
IS ALSO OUR HOPE.

03:03:46.415 --> 03:03:51.420 region:rollup2
THAT STUDENTS OF WHO ARE

03:03:48.651 --> 03:03:53.222 region:rollup2
ACHIEVING A AT THE AB T. WOULD

03:03:51.420 --> 03:03:55.558 region:rollup2

I THE INDEPENDENT SECTOR IS VERY

03:07:54.063 --> 03:07:56.499 region:rollup2
MUCH INVESTED IN ACCESS AND

03:07:55.631 --> 03:07:58.501 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY FOR CALIFORNIA

03:07:56.499 --> 03:07:59.602 region:rollup2

03:08:01.771 --> 03:08:03.773 region:rollup2
INDEPENDENT COLLEGE OR

DEGREE TRANSFER PROGRAM.

03:08:17.953 --> 03:08:21.123 region:rollup2
SO ACCESS IS A CRITICAL PIECE

03:08:19.555 --> 03:08:22.424 region:rollup2

WE ACTUALLY HAVE A STRONG

03:08:35.671 --> 03:08:38.040 region:rollup2
DEGREE OF CONNECTION AND SENSE

03:08:36.972 --> 03:08:40.075 region:rollup2
OF BELONGING FOR OUR STUDENTS

03:08:38.040 --> 03:08:41.877 region:rollup2
BASED IN PART ON OUR SIZE AND

03:08:40.075 --> 03:08:42.478 region:rollup2

STUDENTS AT THE CENTER OF OUR

03:08:42.478 --> 03:08:44.880 region:rollup2
MISSION.

03:08:43.612 --> 03:08:45.848 region:rollup2
HOWEVER WE'RE NOT DOING WELL

03:08:44.880 --> 03:08:47.483 region:rollup2

AT MILLS FOR INSTANCE THERE

03:08:48.617 --> 03:08:51.687 region:rollup2
SEVERAL INITIATIVES THAT ARE

03:08:49.652 --> 03:08:52.354 region:rollup2
UNDERWAY TO IMPROVE HOW STUDENTS

03:08:51.687 --> 03:08:53.989 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY THOSE FROM

03:08:52.354 --> 03:08:55.191 region:rollup2
UNDERREPRESENTED MINORITIES

03:08:53.989 --> 03:08:56.592 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY DO WITH AN ART DEGREE

03:08:55.191 --> 03:08:59.161 region:rollup2

OPPORTUNITIES FOR EVERY STUDENT.

03:09:08.871 --> 03:09:11.941 region:rollup2
WE ALSO ARE IMPLEMENTING E.

03:09:10.206 --> 03:09:13.342 region:rollup2
PORTFOLIOS WHICH GIVE STUDENTS

03:09:11.941 --> 03:09:15.010 region:rollup2
AN OPPORTUNITY FOR A

03:09:13.342 --> 03:09:16.378 region:rollup2
METACOGNITIVE LEARNING

03:09:15.010 --> 03:09:17.880 region:rollup2
REFLECTION TOLL THAT HAS BEEN

03:09:16.378 --> 03:09:19.148 region:rollup2
PROVEN TO IMPROVE OUTCOMES

03:09:17.880 --> 03:09:20.216 region:rollup2
BECAUSE STUDENTS HAVE A CHANCE

03:09:19.148 --> 03:09:21.450 region:rollup2
TO CONNECT TO THE WORK THAT

03:09:20.216 --> 03:09:23.385 region:rollup2
THEY'RE DOING. AND PREPARE IT

03:09:21.450 --> 03:09:24.420 region:rollup2

MIGHT BE INTERESTED AND.

03:09:26.055 --> 03:09:28.691 region:rollup2
WERE ALSO INTERESTED IN MANY OF

03:09:28.057 --> 03:09:29.959 region:rollup2
THE INITIATIVES YOU'VE ALREADY

03:09:28.691 --> 03:09:31.460 region:rollup2
HEARD ABOUT FROM OTHERS ACROSS

03:09:29.959 --> 03:09:32.895 region:rollup2
THE PUBLIC SECTOR.

03:09:31.460 --> 03:09:34.630 region:rollup2
TRANSFORMATIONAL ADVISING.

ASKING A LOT OF OUR FACULTY

03:09:42.338 --> 03:09:44.974 region:rollup2
TODAY AT THE INDEPENDENT

03:09:43.339 --> 03:09:46.075 region:rollup2
COLLEGES AND ELSEWHERE AND WE

03:09:44.974 --> 03:09:47.443 region:rollup2
NEED TO HELP THEM PREPARE TO

03:09:46.075 --> 03:09:49.245 region:rollup2
MEET THAT CHALLENGE BY A BY

03:09:47.443 --> 03:09:51.380 region:rollup2
PREPARING THEM UP FOR THE THE

03:09:49.245 --> 03:09:54.216 region:rollup2
MULTIPLE ROLES THEY HAVE NOW.

03:09:51.380 --> 03:09:55.951 region:rollup2
FINALLY WITH COMPLETION WE CAN'T

03:09:54.216 --> 03:09:57.253 region:rollup2
FAIL TO TALK ABOUT AFFORDABILITY

03:09:55.951 --> 03:09:59.321 region:rollup2
WE REALIZE THOSE THINGS GO HAND

03:09:57.253 --> 03:10:00.589 region:rollup2
IN HAND ACROSS THE SECTOR WERE

03:09:59.321 --> 03:10:02.157 region:rollup2
WORKING TO PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT

FINANCIAL AID TO OUR STUDENTS.

03:10:02.157 --> 03:10:05.461 region:rollup2
AT MILLS WE'VE IMPLEMENTED A

03:10:03.459 --> 03:10:06.962 region:rollup2
HISTORIC TUITION RESET WHERE WE

03:10:05.461 --> 03:10:08.731 region:rollup2
REDUCED OUR TUITION BY THIRTY

03:10:06.962 --> 03:10:10.666 region:rollup2
SIX PERCENT FOR NEXT YEAR.

03:10:08.731 --> 03:10:12.635 region:rollup2
THAT ENABLES US TO BETTER

03:10:10.666 --> 03:10:14.503 region:rollup2
TRANSLATE OUR VALUE TO STUDENTS

03:10:12.635 --> 03:10:15.604 region:rollup2
AND FAMILIES WHO ACTUALLY CAN'T

03:10:14.503 --> 03:10:16.972 region:rollup2
AFFORD AN EDUCATION AND

03:10:15.604 --> 03:10:18.474 region:rollup2
INDEPENDENT COLLEGE BUT DON'T

03:10:16.972 --> 03:10:20.242 region:rollup2
ALWAYS REALIZE THAT FROM THE

03:10:18.474 --> 03:10:22.878 region:rollup2
COMPLEXITY OF PRICING THAT HAS

03:10:20.242 --> 03:10:23.679 region:rollup2
BECOME A HALLMARK OF HIGHER ED.

03:10:22.878 --> 03:10:24.847 region:rollup2
THE LAST THING I WANT TO TALK TO

03:10:23.679 --> 03:10:26.015 region:rollup2
ABOUT HIS INNOVATION AND IT'S

03:10:24.847 --> 03:10:27.383 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE THAT COMING FROM THE

BAY AREA I WOULD TALK TO YOU

03:10:27.383 --> 03:10:29.918 region:rollup2
ABOUT INNOVATION. I I WANT TO

03:10:28.851 --> 03:10:31.820 region:rollup2
GIVE YOU SOME EXAMPLES FROM

03:10:29.918 --> 03:10:33.656 region:rollup2
ACROSS OUR SECTOR I THINK IT'S

03:10:31.820 --> 03:10:34.456 region:rollup2
BEEN A HALLMARK OF CALIFORNIA'S

03:10:33.656 --> 03:10:36.091 region:rollup2
INDEPENDENT COLLEGES AND

03:10:34.456 --> 03:10:37.359 region:rollup2
UNIVERSITIES TO EXPERIMENT TO

03:10:36.091 --> 03:10:39.395 region:rollup2
TRY THINGS AND TO.

03:10:37.359 --> 03:10:40.863 region:rollup2
HIT ON NEW IDEAS THAT CAN MAKE

03:10:39.395 --> 03:10:41.931 region:rollup2
A DIFFERENCE UP ACROSS HIGHER

03:10:40.863 --> 03:10:43.299 region:rollup2
EDUCATION AND NOT ONLY EVEN IN

03:10:41.931 --> 03:10:45.200 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

03:10:43.299 --> 03:10:46.769 region:rollup2
SO CALIFORNIA'S INDEPENDENT

03:10:45.200 --> 03:10:48.070 region:rollup2
COLLEGES WERE AMONG THE FIRST TO

03:10:46.769 --> 03:10:48.938 region:rollup2
HAVE FOUR YEAR COMBINED

WE'VE ALSO HAD SEVERAL

03:10:59.348 --> 03:11:01.717 region:rollup2
INSTITUTIONS MAKE SPECIFIC

03:11:00.616 --> 03:11:03.585 region:rollup2
ARRANGEMENTS A COUPLE OF

03:11:01.717 --> 03:11:05.721 region:rollup2
EXAMPLES POINT LOMA NAZARENE

03:11:03.585 --> 03:11:07.456 region:rollup2
UNIVERSITY LANDLOCKED AND NOT
