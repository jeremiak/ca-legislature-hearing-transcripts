00:44:15.052 --> 00:44:16.754
EXPRESS THAT PUBLICLY THAT WE

IMPACT OF COVERT NINETEEN HAS

00:49:17.888 --> 00:49:19.356

WERE MADE WE RECOGNIZE THAT

00:54:14.217 --> 00:54:15.652
THERE IS A BALANCE THAT NEEDS

00:54:15.719 --> 00:54:17.020
TO BE REACHED BETWEEN

00:54:17.087 --> 00:54:17.921
PROTECTING PUBLIC HEALTH AND

00:54:17.988 --> 00:54:19.689
SAFETY. AND CONDUCTING THE

00:54:19.756 --> 00:54:21.591
BUSINESS OF THE STATE. BUT THE

00:54:21.658 --> 00:54:23.526
FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE

00:54:23.593 --> 00:54:26.796
STATE AND OF THIS INSTITUTION.

00:54:26.863 --> 00:54:28.932
STATE YOUR IS ACT TO THE- TO BE

ABLE TO DO YOUR PROCEEDINGS IN

00:54:30.567 --> 00:54:32.268
YOUR DOUBLE THE DELIBERATIONS.

00:54:32.335 --> 00:54:34.671
IN THE OPENING DAY LIFE IN THE

00:54:34.738 --> 00:54:37.007
TRANSPARENCY. NATURE OF THE

00:54:37.073 --> 00:54:38.541
PROCEEDINGS IS WHAT MAKES THE

00:54:38.608 --> 00:54:40.577
DEMOCRACY WORK. AND TOO WHEN

00:54:40.644 --> 00:54:45.048
YOU. AND YOU REMOVE YOURSELF

00:54:45.115 --> 00:54:46.750
FROM THE ABILITY OF THE PUBLIC

00:54:46.816 --> 00:54:48.118
TO BEAR WITNESS TO WHAT YOU'RE

00:54:48.184 --> 00:54:49.619
DOING. IT MAKES IT VERY

00:54:49.686 --> 00:54:51.254
DIFFICULT FOR THE PUBLIC TO

00:54:51.321 --> 00:54:53.623
HAVE THE CONTINUED CONFIDENCE

00:54:53.690 --> 00:54:55.058
IN THE RESULTS THAT YOU

00:54:55.125 --> 00:54:57.494
PRODUCED HERE. AND SO FROM OUR

00:54:57.560 --> 00:54:59.062
PERSPECTIVE WE FEEL THAT THIS

00:54:59.129 --> 00:55:00.430
IS A VERY SLIPPERY SLOPE TO BE

00:55:00.497 --> 00:55:02.766
GOING DOWN. AGAIN RECOGNIZING

00:55:02.832 --> 00:55:04.067
THE NEED TO BALANCE PUBLIC

00:55:04.134 --> 00:55:06.236
SAFETY AND PERSONAL SAFETY

00:55:06.302 --> 00:55:07.904
AGAINST THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF

00:55:07.971 --> 00:55:09.606
THE LEGISLATURE. AND SPEAKING

00:55:09.673 --> 00:55:11.841
AS A CITIZEN OF CALIFORNIA I

00:55:11.908 --> 00:55:13.543
SHARE THE SAME VIEWS AND I

00:55:13.610 --> 00:55:15.478
THINK MY COLLEAGUES DO AS WELL.

00:55:15.545 --> 00:55:18.181
AND FOR US THE LEGISLATURE IS

00:55:18.248 --> 00:55:19.983
THESE A SYMBOL OF THE

00:55:20.050 --> 00:55:21.418
GOVERNMENT. YOU HAVE THE

00:55:21.484 --> 00:55:22.619
EXECUTIVE AND MISTER MULLIN

00:55:22.686 --> 00:55:24.020
SPOKE VERY WELL OF. THE

00:55:24.087 --> 00:55:26.790
EXECUTIVE POWER AND THE USE OF

00:55:26.856 --> 00:55:28.291
THAT EXECUTIVE POWER OVER THESE

00:55:28.358 --> 00:55:29.759
LAST FEW MONTHS. THE

00:55:29.826 --> 00:55:31.094
LEGISLATURE HAS BEEN SOMEWHAT

00:55:31.161 --> 00:55:33.229
IN ADVANCE YOUR BACK AND THAT'S

00:55:33.296 --> 00:55:35.231
A GREAT THING FROM THE BALANCE

00:55:35.298 --> 00:55:37.333
OF POWER POINT OF VIEW. BUT THE

00:55:37.400 --> 00:55:40.937
ISSUE IS THIS BUILDING THIS-CAPITAL REPRESENTS THE

00:55:41.004 --> 00:55:43.239
LEGISLATURE IN GOVERNMENT. AND

00:55:43.306 --> 00:55:45.141
IN TIMES OF CRISIS LIKE WE ARE

00:55:45.208 --> 00:55:47.410
NOW THE PANDEMIC NO ONE COULD

00:55:47.477 --> 00:55:48.945
HAVE FORESEEN THAT. THE CIVIL

00:55:49.012 --> 00:55:50.613
UNREST AND WE SEE VERY IN THE

00:55:50.680 --> 00:55:53.149
STREETS AROUND OUR STATE AND

00:55:53.216 --> 00:55:53.983
AROUND THE COUNTRY. THIS

00:55:54.050 --> 00:55:55.885
MOMENT. NO WHATEVER COULD HAVE

00:55:55.952 --> 00:55:58.521
PREDICTED A PANDEMIC. AND THE

00:55:58.588 --> 00:55:59.923
CIVIL UNREST THAT WE'RE SEEING

00:55:59.989 --> 00:56:01.357
TODAY THE CITIZENS OF

00:56:01.424 --> 00:56:03.293
CALIFORNIANS LOOK TO YOU. IN

00:56:03.359 --> 00:56:04.627
THIS ROOM IN THIS BUILDING FOR

00:56:04.694 --> 00:56:06.529
LEADERSHIP THIS BUILDING IS THE

00:56:06.596 --> 00:56:08.465
SYMBOL OF THAT LEADERSHIP. AND

00:56:08.531 --> 00:56:10.133
WHEN YOU LEAVE YOU NEED TO

00:56:10.200 --> 00:56:12.569
LEAVE FROM HERE. THIS IS WHERE

00:56:12.635 --> 00:56:14.304
YOU BELONG. AND SO FOR OUR

00:56:14.370 --> 00:56:16.806
POINT OF VIEW AS PROFESSIONALS

00:56:16.873 --> 00:56:18.074
YES WE'VE ENTERED A VERY

00:56:18.141 --> 00:56:20.477
DIFFICULT TIME. WE WILL WISH TO

00:56:20.543 --> 00:56:23.146
HAVE A DIALOGUE ABOUT HOW WE

00:56:23.213 --> 00:56:23.680
CAN MAKE IT BETTER IN THE

00:56:23.747 --> 00:56:25.615
FUTURE. FROM THE LARGER POINT

00:56:25.682 --> 00:56:27.250
OF VIEW OF GOVERNANCE AND THE

00:56:27.317 --> 00:56:29.152
RESPONSIBILITY THAT WE ALL HAVE

00:56:29.219 --> 00:56:31.221
TO OUR DEMOCRACY. THIS IS A BAD

00:56:31.287 --> 00:56:33.656
IDEA AND THAT THE MINUTE WE

00:56:33.723 --> 00:56:35.759
START REMOVING OURSELVES TO OUR

00:56:35.825 --> 00:56:37.727

01:40:16.844 --> 01:40:18.412
THE ASSEMBLY AND THE SENATE

01:40:18.479 --> 01:40:21.181
BODIES BECOME DURING THOSE

01:40:21.248 --> 01:40:24.585
TIMES WHICH WE DON'T GET TO

01:40:24.651 --> 01:40:26.920
CALL THE GOVERNOR GETS TO CALL.

01:40:26.987 --> 01:40:29.723
SO WE WHEN YOU START LOOKING AT

01:40:29.790 --> 01:40:32.793
THIS HOW DO WE BALANCE THIS

01:40:32.860 --> 01:40:35.295
POWER ROUTE. HOW DO WE ENSURE

01:40:35.362 --> 01:40:38.298
THAT. THOSE OF US THAT THAT ARE

01:40:38.365 --> 01:40:42.603
ELECTED AND I THINK ABOUT THE

01:40:42.669 --> 01:40:47.641
HOW CRAZY IT IS. AMBER'S IN L.

01:40:47.708 --> 01:40:48.208
A. AS AN ASSEMBLY MEMBER WE

01:40:48.275 --> 01:40:50.544
REPRESENT. JUST UNDER HALF A

01:40:50.611 --> 01:40:53.480
MILLION PEOPLE THAT THAT'S MORE

01:40:53.547 --> 01:40:55.416
THAN THE GOVERNOR OF MISSOURI.

01:40:55.482 --> 01:40:56.917
SO THIS MORE THAN A GOVERNOR OF

01:40:56.984 --> 01:40:59.052
A LOT OF THE STATES THAT THAT

01:40:59.119 --> 01:41:01.722
ARE AROUND US AND- TO THINK

01:41:01.789 --> 01:41:03.123
ABOUT THAT AWESOME

01:41:03.190 --> 01:41:05.692
RESPONSIBILITY. AND TO THINK

01:41:05.759 --> 01:41:08.328
ABOUT WHAT HAS HAPPENED OVER

01:41:08.395 --> 01:41:12.366
THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS. OVER

01:41:12.433 --> 01:41:15.402
THE ABILITY OF A GOVERNOR TO

01:41:15.469 --> 01:41:16.870
JUST ONE WITH A PEN. AND CHANGE

01:41:16.937 --> 01:41:20.274
THAT TO GO RIGHT PAST THE

01:41:20.340 --> 01:41:22.342
LEGISLATIVE BODY IN AND FRANKLY

01:41:22.409 --> 01:41:25.879
DO WHATEVER THE HELL HE WANTS.

01:41:25.946 --> 01:41:28.048
AND THEN I LOOK AT THIS AND GO.

01:41:28.115 --> 01:41:30.551
IF FOR SOME UNGODLY REASON THIS

01:41:30.617 --> 01:41:34.721
HAPPENS AGAIN. I DON'T WANT TO

01:41:34.788 --> 01:41:38.058
BE STUCK ON THE SIDELINES.

01:41:38.125 --> 01:41:41.628
WATCHING ON THE NEWS. THE

01:41:41.695 --> 01:41:43.597

01:41:51.505 --> 01:41:57.244
HOPE. EXPRESSLY TO MY COLLEAGUE

01:42:02.950 --> 01:42:05.385
OPPORTUNITY TO REAL IN THE

01:42:05.452 --> 01:42:07.421
EXECUTIVE BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT

01:42:07.488 --> 01:42:11.058

THING WE TRY TO GET THEM TO DO-

01:42:16.930 --> 01:42:19.733
BECAUSE THEY TEND TO INTERPRET

01:42:19.800 --> 01:42:22.603
THINGS HOW THEY WANT. IN

01:42:22.669 --> 01:42:25.706

GRAVE CONCERNS. ABOUT THE

01:42:31.745 --> 01:42:34.648
TRANSPARENCY SIDE OF IT.

01:42:34.715 --> 01:42:36.717
BECAUSE WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO

01:42:36.783 --> 01:42:38.685
TALK TO OUR PUBLIC AND WE

01:42:38.752 --> 01:42:40.454
SHOULD BE DOING THAT IN FOR THE

01:42:40.521 --> 01:42:44.858
PUBLIC. IF WE'RE NOT RECALLS

THE ASPECT THAT THIS GOAL SUCH

01:43:04.912 --> 01:43:08.749
POTENTIALLY ON THE BALLOT WHERE

01:43:08.815 --> 01:43:10.551
PEOPLE CAN HAVE MORE TIME TO

READ IT TO UNDERSTAND IT. TO

01:43:14.221 --> 01:43:17.758
SEE HOW THIS WILL PLAY OUT TO

01:43:17.824 --> 01:43:20.694
TAKE THE POWER AWAY FROM THE

01:43:20.761 --> 01:43:22.563
LEGISLATIVE BODY AND GIVE THE

01:43:22.629 --> 01:43:24.565
POWER TO THE PEOPLE TO VOTE ON

01:43:24.631 --> 01:43:26.833
IT. I THINK IS IMPORTANT. IS

01:43:26.900 --> 01:43:27.968
THAT A MOTION ON THE BILL OF

01:43:28.035 --> 01:43:29.536

TRANSPARENCY IS IMPORTANT I

01:44:29.062 --> 01:44:31.732

THE SEPARATION OF POWERS

01:44:41.008 --> 01:44:42.843
STRUCTURE- THAN IN MANY WAYS

01:44:42.909 --> 01:44:43.944

APPROPRIATELY DEAD DUE TO COVER

LEGISLATORS AS REPRESENTATIVE

01:45:07.868 --> 01:45:09.803
OF NEARLY HALF MILLION PEOPLE

01:45:09.870 --> 01:45:11.204
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE

01:45:11.271 --> 01:45:12.339
WERE LARGELY SHUT OUT OF THE

01:45:12.406 --> 01:45:13.407
PROCESS OF GOVERNING THIS IS.

01:45:13.473 --> 01:45:15.108
CRITICISM OF ANY PARTICULAR

01:45:15.175 --> 01:45:16.376
BORDERS BUT I WOULD JUST NOTE

01:45:16.443 --> 01:45:18.445
THAT THERE BEEN FORTY PLUS. THE

THEY CHANGE ALL SORTS OF

01:45:23.450 --> 01:45:25.952
THINGS- WITHOUT THE LEGISLATIVE

01:45:26.019 --> 01:45:27.287
DELIVER PROCESS IN THE

01:45:27.354 --> 01:45:28.789
OPPORTUNITY FOR TRANSPARENCY IN

01:45:28.855 --> 01:45:29.956
INPUT FROM THE PUBLIC THAT'S A

01:45:30.023 --> 01:45:33.060
PROBLEM. THAT'S A PROBLEM. A

01:45:33.126 --> 01:45:34.628
IT'S A BIG PROBLEM THIS. WEEK

01:45:34.695 --> 01:45:36.797
WE NEED TO FIND THE BALANCE SO

01:45:36.863 --> 01:45:37.564
WE HAVE THE PEOPLE'S

01:45:37.631 --> 01:45:39.666
REPRESENTATIVES WHO SPEAK FOR

01:45:39.733 --> 01:45:41.334
OUR CONSTITUENTS AND ARE ARE

01:45:41.401 --> 01:45:42.903
RECEPTIVE TO THEM AND HEAR WHAT

01:45:42.969 --> 01:45:44.304
THEY HAVE TO SAY AND TELL US.

01:45:44.371 --> 01:45:45.706
AND THEN CARRIED OUT FORWARD

01:45:45.772 --> 01:45:48.408
INTO INTO THE GOVERNING BODY-

01:45:48.475 --> 01:45:50.343
AND ENACT THAT THROUGH A-

01:45:50.410 --> 01:45:52.245
CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRATIC

01:45:52.312 --> 01:45:53.814
PROCESS. AND WE'VE GOT TO BE

01:45:53.880 --> 01:45:54.781
ABLE TO DO THAT DURING

01:45:54.848 --> 01:45:55.615
EMERGENCIES I DON'T KNOW WHAT

01:45:55.682 --> 01:45:57.084
KIND OF. NEW EMERGENCIES WILL

01:45:57.150 --> 01:45:59.252
COME UP IN THE FUTURE AS PEOPLE

01:45:59.319 --> 01:46:00.721
POINTED OUT NOBODY EXPECTED

01:46:00.787 --> 01:46:03.056
THIS PANDEMIC TO COME UP- BUT

01:46:03.123 --> 01:46:06.693
I. I DID NOT ENJOY HAVING

01:46:06.760 --> 01:46:08.762
CONSTITUENTS JUST LIKE ALL THIS

01:46:08.829 --> 01:46:10.764
EXPRESSING THEIR GRAVE CONCERNS

01:46:10.831 --> 01:46:11.798
ABOUT THE DIRECTION OF STATE

01:46:11.865 --> 01:46:13.800
GOVERNMENT. ON AND HAVING SOME

01:46:13.867 --> 01:46:16.503
VERY UNPRECEDENTED DRACONIAN

01:46:16.570 --> 01:46:18.105
THINGS BEING IMPOSED UPON THEM.

01:46:18.171 --> 01:46:19.506
AND A AND ASKED TO MAKE

01:46:19.573 --> 01:46:21.441
TREMENDOUS SACRIFICE FOR PUBLIC

01:46:21.508 --> 01:46:24.311
HEALTH- YOU HAVE WHICH WAS

01:46:24.377 --> 01:46:26.113
APPROPRIATE AT AT THE TIME FOR

01:46:26.179 --> 01:46:27.848
A TIME BUT I DIDN'T LIKE THE

01:46:27.914 --> 01:46:29.583
FACT THAT MY ONLY ABILITY TO

01:46:29.649 --> 01:46:31.218
INFLUENCE. STATE GOVERNMENT IN

01:46:31.284 --> 01:46:33.754
CALIFORNIA WAS. CALLING AND

01:46:33.820 --> 01:46:36.022
EMAILING THE GOVERNOR YEAH. I

01:46:36.089 --> 01:46:37.991
DON'T THINK THAT'S GOOD. THAT'S

01:46:38.058 --> 01:46:39.326
WHY I THINK THIS BILL WOULD

01:46:39.392 --> 01:46:40.427
RESTORE SOME OF THE DEMOCRATIC

01:46:40.494 --> 01:46:43.063
POWER TO CREATE- A LITTLE BIT

01:46:43.130 --> 01:46:46.433
BETTER BALLOTS I A SO THAT'S

01:46:46.500 --> 01:46:48.368
WHY I ULTIMATELY DECIDED TO

01:46:48.435 --> 01:46:50.103
COME ON BOARD- TO SUPPORT IT

01:46:50.170 --> 01:46:52.339
HI. WITH WITH DUE REGARD TO THE

01:46:52.405 --> 01:46:53.807
TRANSPARENCY ISSUES AND I THINK

01:46:53.874 --> 01:46:54.808
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE

01:46:54.875 --> 01:46:56.710
WORKED ON ALSO IT SHOULD BE

01:46:56.777 --> 01:46:57.844
MENTIONED FOR EVERYBODY THAT

01:46:57.911 --> 01:46:58.979
CALLED IN OPPOSITION PEOPLE

01:46:59.045 --> 01:47:00.714
THAT SPOKE WE ARE VOTING TO PUT

01:47:00.781 --> 01:47:02.182
THIS ON THE BALLOT FOR THE

01:47:02.249 --> 01:47:04.017
VOTERS TO VOTE FOR. THERE'S

01:47:04.084 --> 01:47:05.152
NOTHING MORE DEMOCRATIC THAN

01:47:05.218 --> 01:47:06.853
THAT THE VOTERS OF CALIFORNIA

01:47:06.920 --> 01:47:08.421
WILL DECIDE IN NOVEMBER WHETHER

01:47:08.488 --> 01:47:10.724
THEY WANT THIS CHANGE OR NOT.

01:47:10.791 --> 01:47:12.392
WE'RE GIVING THEM THE OPTION. I

01:47:12.459 --> 01:47:13.393
THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT STATE

01:47:13.460 --> 01:47:15.695
FOR THE RECORD VERY CLEARLY- I

01:47:15.762 --> 01:47:17.063
DID HAVE ONE TECHNICAL QUESTION

ON THE PROXY VOTING ASPECT- I

01:47:19.699 --> 01:47:21.334
SEE A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN REMOTE

01:47:21.401 --> 01:47:23.770
VOTING. AND PROXY VOTING PROXY

01:47:23.837 --> 01:47:25.605
VOTING DOES TO ME RAISE SOME

01:47:25.672 --> 01:47:27.774
CONSTITUTIONAL. CONCERNS THAT

01:47:27.841 --> 01:47:29.543
ARE NOT RAISED. IT WITH THE

01:47:29.609 --> 01:47:31.211

CHILDREN. DISTANCE LEARNING WE

01:49:16.283 --> 01:49:18.852
HAVE ALL NEEDED TO ADAPT AND

01:49:18.919 --> 01:49:20.921
FIGURE OUT A WAY TO GET THROUGH

01:49:20.987 --> 01:49:23.189
THE STATE OF EMERGENCY. AND DO

01:49:23.256 --> 01:49:24.891

LEVEL TRANSPARENCY AND

01:49:33.333 --> 01:49:34.701
COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT THAT IS

01:49:34.768 --> 01:49:36.903
NECESSARY AND SOME OF THE

01:49:36.970 --> 01:49:38.004
THINGS THAT WE'VE DONE HAVE

01:49:38.071 --> 01:49:40.874
ACTUALLY INCREASED- HERE IN THE

01:49:40.941 --> 01:49:42.943
CAPITAL ENGAGEMENT. WHICH HAS

01:49:43.009 --> 01:49:44.411
BEEN NOTED FOR EXAMPLE THE

01:49:44.477 --> 01:49:45.912
ABILITY TO PETE FOR PEOPLE THAT

01:49:45.979 --> 01:49:47.614
WHETHER THEY CAN TAKE THE DAY

01:49:47.681 --> 01:49:49.516
OFF FROM WORK OR CARING FOR A

01:49:49.582 --> 01:49:52.619
LOVED ONE- AND CAN SPEND MONEY

01:49:52.686 --> 01:49:54.754
TO TRAVEL TO SACRAMENTO AND

01:49:54.821 --> 01:49:57.557
TAKE THAT AND TO GET TO SACK.

01:49:57.624 --> 01:50:00.226
SO THAT NO MATTER WHO YOU.

01:50:00.293 --> 01:50:02.095
EIGHT IN THIS PROCEEDING AND-

01:50:02.162 --> 01:50:03.296
AND THAT'S A PRETTY AMAZING

01:50:03.363 --> 01:50:05.098
THING IT'S A IT'S A GREAT

01:50:05.165 --> 01:50:07.901
THING- BECAUSE OF THE HIGH COST

01:50:07.968 --> 01:50:08.735
OF ACTUALLY GETTING TO

01:50:08.802 --> 01:50:10.670
SACRAMENTO THAT'S TOO MANY

01:50:10.737 --> 01:50:12.906
PEOPLE HAVE TO EXPERIENCE OR

01:50:12.973 --> 01:50:14.074
DECIDE THAT THEIR PRESENCE

01:50:14.140 --> 01:50:15.542
ISN'T SOMETHING THAT THEY CAN

01:50:15.608 --> 01:50:18.044
AFFORD TO DO- OF COURSE THEY'VE

01:50:18.111 --> 01:50:18.979
ALWAYS BEEN ABLE TO WRITE

01:50:19.045 --> 01:50:21.548
LETTERS AND WE WANT TO CONTINUE

01:50:21.614 --> 01:50:24.918
TO DO THAT AND DO THAT BY. ALSO

01:50:24.985 --> 01:50:27.654
NOTED IS THE CONCERN ABOUT WHEN

01:50:27.721 --> 01:50:29.022
THIS WHATEVER OCCUR BECAUSE WE

01:50:29.089 --> 01:50:30.223
CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO AND THE

01:50:30.290 --> 01:50:31.591
WAY THAT WE HAVE TRADITIONALLY

01:50:31.658 --> 01:50:33.293
CONDUCTED OUR WORK. WITH THIS

01:50:33.360 --> 01:50:36.229
ACTUALLY REALLY IS A- WORST

01:50:36.296 --> 01:50:38.932
CASE SCENARIO BUT ONLY UNDER

01:50:38.999 --> 01:50:41.601
CERTAIN COMMIT CONDITIONS AND-

01:50:41.668 --> 01:50:43.670
WITH RULES THAT HAVE BEEN

01:50:43.737 --> 01:50:51.411
AGREED TO- BY THE TWO HOUSES SO.

01:50:51.478 --> 01:50:53.980
THERE IS A LOT OF. IF THE EAST

01:50:54.047 --> 01:50:56.683
ASKED BY VOTERS RULES MUST BE

01:50:56.750 --> 01:50:59.152
AGREED TO BY THE ASSEMBLY AND

01:50:59.219 --> 01:51:03.757
THE SENATE. FOR HOW TO- CONVENE

01:51:03.823 --> 01:51:05.792
IN THAT STATE OF EMERGENCY AND

01:51:05.859 --> 01:51:07.594
SO THERE IS A LOT MORE WORK TO

01:51:07.660 --> 01:51:10.730
BE DONE TO YOUR HOW WE ENSURE.

01:51:10.797 --> 01:51:14.000
ACCESS AND TRANSPARENCY- IN

01:51:14.067 --> 01:51:16.569
THAT STATE OF EMERGENCY MEETING

01:51:16.636 --> 01:51:18.571
AND SO AGAIN I WANT TO THINK

01:51:18.638 --> 01:51:20.440
THAT THE MEMBER THE OP.

01:51:20.507 --> 01:51:21.941

GOVERNMENT WORK AND TOO OFTEN-

01:51:29.215 --> 01:51:31.684

01:51:31.751 --> 01:51:33.153
TO END THE OPPORTUNITY HAVE

01:51:33.219 --> 01:51:36.089
COME IN OF GOVERNMENT ARE

01:51:39.125 --> 01:51:40.260
SURE THAT GOVERNMENT DOES NOT

01:51:40.326 --> 01:51:43.596
WERE DISCORD. SO DISTRAUGHT AND

01:51:43.663 --> 01:51:45.598
TO UNDERMINE CONFIDENCE IN THE

01:51:45.665 --> 01:51:48.268
ABILITY FOR GOVERNMENTS TO DO

01:51:48.334 --> 01:51:48.868

INTEGRITY IN OUR GOVERNMENT

01:52:37.050 --> 01:52:39.919
DâN AS WE LOOK AT THE CIVIL ON

01:52:39.986 --> 01:52:41.788

01:52:41.855 --> 01:52:44.691
HEARING IT BECAUSE HE- CAN AND

01:52:44.757 --> 01:52:48.428

01:52:51.731 --> 01:52:53.133
IN SACRAMENTO IT CAN BE AT

01:52:53.199 --> 01:52:55.101
THEIR LOCAL FOR MEN. TIMES A

01:52:55.168 --> 01:52:57.670
PUBLIC. THE AMOUNT OF KHAT I

01:52:57.737 --> 01:52:59.139
KNOW WHEN I FOR AIR FROM LOCAL

01:52:59.205 --> 01:53:01.708
GOVERNMENT WHERE COMMUNITY

01:53:01.774 --> 01:53:05.245
MEMBERS CAN SPEAK FOR THREE

01:53:05.311 --> 01:53:05.879
MINUTES ON A TOPIC IN SOME SOME

01:53:05.945 --> 01:53:08.381
EVEN LONG. ON NOT POSTED ITEM

01:53:08.448 --> 01:53:10.083
IT WAS A SHOCK TO COME UP HERE

01:53:10.150 --> 01:53:12.752
AND FIND OUT THAT THERE WAS TWO

01:53:12.819 --> 01:53:15.388
WITNESSES WHO COULD SPEAK AND

01:53:15.455 --> 01:53:18.324
THEN YOU COULD EITHER STATE OP

01:53:18.391 --> 01:53:21.661
CENTER SUPPORT. THOUGH I KNOW.

01:53:21.728 --> 01:53:22.228
YOU KNOW THE PUBLIC DOESN'T

THESE THEY LOOK THE IDEA THAT

01:53:26.599 --> 01:53:29.836
IF THEY CHOOSE. A SO I THINK

01:53:29.903 --> 01:53:31.838
THAT I WILL STILL. IN THIS

01:53:31.905 --> 01:53:34.874
FORWARD BUT- THE CONCERN THAT I

01:53:34.941 --> 01:53:38.011
HEARD ABOUT WILL WE MAKE UP A

01:53:38.077 --> 01:53:40.013
REASON TO HAVE AN EMERGENCY OR

01:53:40.079 --> 01:53:42.515
WHAT WOULD BE THE CRITERIA FOR

01:53:42.582 --> 01:53:45.251
A FUTURE EMERGENCY I THINK THAT

01:53:45.318 --> 01:53:47.687
THERE SO THAT BELIEVE WE

01:53:47.754 --> 01:53:50.623
SHOULDN'T HAVE EVEN CALL THE

01:53:50.690 --> 01:53:52.992
CALL THE NINETEEN MARGINS

01:53:53.059 --> 01:53:55.461
ENDEMIC. IN THAT'S UP FOR. AND

01:53:55.528 --> 01:53:57.564
BUT- I STARTED ON ANOTHER ISSUE

HALF A MILLION VOTERS VOTE AND

01:54:05.138 --> 01:54:06.839
WE REPRESENT THEM AND I TAKE

01:54:06.906 --> 01:54:11.044
THAT SERIOUSLY. AND WITH THAT I

01:54:11.110 --> 01:54:11.911
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE

01:54:11.978 --> 01:54:14.280
VOTERS KNOW WHAT WE'RE GOING NO

01:54:14.347 --> 01:54:16.950
WHERE WERE AT. IT WE SHOULD BE

01:54:17.016 --> 01:54:20.853
HERE AND WE CAN BE. SO THAT

01:54:20.920 --> 01:54:23.489
MEANS I WANT TO CLEAR TO THE

01:54:23.556 --> 01:54:25.258
PEOPLE WHO ARE WATCHING THIS

01:54:25.325 --> 01:54:27.660
THAT THIS WILL NOW GO TO THE

01:54:27.727 --> 01:54:29.295
FLOOR OF THE STATE ASSEMBLY.

01:54:29.362 --> 01:54:31.331
AND IT PASSED IT WILL GO TO

01:54:31.397 --> 01:54:33.366
BALLOT. THERE IS MORE

01:54:33.433 --> 01:54:34.767
OPPORTUNITY FOR THE PUBLIC TO

01:54:34.834 --> 01:54:37.837
WEIGH. FOR IT READ. AND TO BE

01:54:37.904 --> 01:54:40.039

JURORS MENTION WE'D BE UP IN A

01:54:43.843 --> 01:54:46.512

BY. AND THEN. NOT WHAT YOU

01:54:51.951 --> 01:54:53.152
PROPOSED HERE BUT I DO IN THE

01:54:53.219 --> 01:54:55.788
PUBLIC LAST BUT NOT LEAST I

01:54:55.855 --> 01:54:58.057
THINK WE HAVE SEEN SOME.

01:54:58.124 --> 01:55:00.059
ADDITIONAL UP OPPORTUNITIES FOR

01:55:00.126 --> 01:55:03.263
THE PUBLIC TO BE INVOLVED WITH

01:55:03.329 --> 01:55:05.231

I'M HERE. CAN PARTICIPATE IN

01:55:12.038 --> 01:55:14.374
ZOOM CALL THE MY EX OF EVENTS

01:55:14.440 --> 01:55:17.176
GOING ON. IN THE DISTRICT WHERE

01:55:17.243 --> 01:55:18.478
I REALLY NEVER. TO NEEDED

01:55:18.544 --> 01:55:20.813
BEFORE. SO I THOUGHT WE'DTAKE

01:55:20.880 --> 01:55:23.049
THE BEST FROM THIS CRISIS BUT

01:55:23.116 --> 01:55:26.552
WHAT THE FOCUS ALWAYS ON WE

01:55:26.619 --> 01:55:30.723
SERVE THE PUBLIC THANK YOU. I

01:55:30.790 --> 01:55:32.725
HAVE A MOTION IS THERE A SECOND.

01:55:32.792 --> 01:55:36.696
CENTER BY MS CARILLO. I WANT TO

01:55:36.763 --> 01:55:41.167
SPEAK TO THIS AND- THIS ISN'T A

01:55:41.234 --> 01:55:43.670
FINISHER I THINK IT IS VERY

01:55:43.736 --> 01:55:44.270
IMPORTANT TO NOTE AS HAS BEEN

01:55:44.337 --> 01:55:46.839
EXPRESSED. THIS IS A PROPOSED

01:55:46.906 --> 01:55:48.141
CONSCIOUS AMENDMENTS WHAT

01:55:48.207 --> 01:55:50.043
ACTUALLY HAS TO GO BEFORE. THE

01:55:50.109 --> 01:55:51.844
WE THE PEOPLE TO WEIGH AND

01:55:51.911 --> 01:55:54.514
EVALUATE IT. I THINK IT IS A

01:55:54.580 --> 01:55:55.782
DEEPLY PROBLEMATIC IN OUR

01:55:55.848 --> 01:55:57.617
SISTER GOVERNMENT TO HAVE A

01:55:57.684 --> 01:56:00.253
CIRCUMSTANCE ARISE. THAT SIGNED

01:56:00.320 --> 01:56:02.555
LINES AND RENDERS AN EFFECTIVE

01:56:02.622 --> 01:56:04.857
THE LEGISLATURE. AT A TIME OF

01:56:04.924 --> 01:56:09.796
CRISIS. THE OUR SYSTEM OF

01:56:09.862 --> 01:56:12.265
GOVERNMENT DOES NOT WORK WELL

01:56:12.332 --> 01:56:14.634
WHEN ONE ANYONE BRANCH OF THE

01:56:14.701 --> 01:56:17.203
GOVERNMENT. HAS THE UPPER HAND

01:56:17.270 --> 01:56:18.204
IN THE OTHER BRANCHES ARE

01:56:18.271 --> 01:56:25.445
IMPOTENT. SO. I ACTUALLY FEEL

01:56:25.511 --> 01:56:27.647
THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT

01:56:27.714 --> 01:56:31.017
QUESTION. HOW DO WE MAKE MAJOR

01:56:31.084 --> 01:56:33.586
EFFECT IN TIMES OF CRISIS SO

01:56:33.653 --> 01:56:37.023
OUR JOB OF BEING A- CHECK AND

01:56:37.090 --> 01:56:38.558
BALANCE WITHOUR DEMOCRATIC

01:56:38.624 --> 01:56:40.626
SYSTEM GOVERNOR CAN BE UPHELD.

01:56:40.693 --> 01:56:42.628
THAT'S WHAT THIS PRESENTS AS A

01:56:42.695 --> 01:56:44.731
QUESTION. I WANT TO MAKE AN

01:56:44.797 --> 01:56:46.899
OBSERVATION ABOUT THE

01:56:46.966 --> 01:56:48.601
TIMELINESS ACTUALLY OF A

01:56:48.668 --> 01:56:51.304
QUESTION LIKE THIS. YOU KNOW

01:56:51.371 --> 01:56:52.872
THINGS APPEAR ON THE BALLOT ALL

01:56:52.939 --> 01:56:54.674
THE TIMES THE LEGISLATURE MAY

01:56:54.741 --> 01:56:56.175
PUT THINGS ON THE BALLOT THEY
