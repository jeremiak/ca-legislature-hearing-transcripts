THREE ZERO SIX BY DR PAN DOCTRINE WELCOME THANK YOU THINK OF ITS CHAIR- MEMBERS ALWAYS APPRECIATE TO SUMMER GIPSON DIRECTIONS OF GOT HERE- THANKS VERY MUCH FOR HAVING ME HERE WE'RE AT A CRISIS POINT WHEN IT COMES TO STD INFECTIONS IN THIS COUNTRY THE CDC ESTIMATES THAT ONE IN FIVE. WELL IN THE UNITED STATES HAVE AN STD. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN ALMOST SIXTY EIGHT MILLION STD INFECTIONS REPORTED AND RATES OF SYPHILIS CHLAMYDIA AND GONORRHEA- UP FORTY PERCENT. TO TWENTY THIRTEEN. THIS CRISIS AFFECTS COMMITTEES ACROSS THE STATE THE CALIFORNIA YOUTH PEOPLE OF COLOR CASE SEXUAL. I SEXUAL TRANSGENDER PEOPLE ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED. OVER HALF OF ALL THE CITIES IN THE STATE ARE REPORTED AMONG YOU. AFTER AMERICANS ARE 5100% MORE LIKELY TO CONTRACT HONOREE INCLUDE MANY OF THEM TO WHAT COUNTERPARTS. THESE DISPARITIES ARE EXPECTED TO WORSEN AS A RESULT OF THE COVER NINETEEN PANDEMIC. CALIFORNIA HAD THE SECOND HIGHEST SYPHILIS RATES IN THE NATION IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN. BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT TWENTY EIGHTEEN SYPHILIS RATES AMONG WOMEN REPRODUCTIVE AGE INCREASED BY SEVEN HUNDRED FORTY THREE PERCENT. WELL THE HARDEST DATA POINTS FOR ME TO. SQUARE WITH HAS TO DO WITH THE RATES OF CONGENITAL SYPHILIS A CONDITION WE HOPE THAT WHICH IS TREATABLE AND WE- HOPE THEY GOT AWAY WITH THE VICTORIAN ERA AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED TWENTY NINE BABIES WERE BORN WITH CONGENITAL SYPHILIS IN CALIFORNIA. A 9100% INCREASE SINCE TWENTY TWELVE. AND THAT YEAR TWENTY STILL BIRTHS WERE ASSOCIATED WITH THE DISEASE. HAPPEN CAN JOSEPH LIST CASES OCCUR BECAUSE OF GAPS IN TESTING AND TREATMENT DURING PRENATAL CARE. THIS BILL WILL INCREASE ACCESS TO STD SCREENING AND TREATMENT BY. INCREASING USE OF CALIFORNIA'S EXPEDITED PARTNER THERAPY COMMITTEE HIV COUNSELOR SAID MR RAPID STDS TESTS OPENING UP ACCESS TO THE FAMILY PACK PROGRAM REQUIRING INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR HOME STD TESTING. AND REQUIRE A DISH CIVIL SCREENINGS AND PRENATAL CARE. SB THREE OH SIXTY SIX COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO ADDRESSING CALIFORNIA'S AS HE CRISIS EXPANDING ACCESS IN AN EQUITABLE WAY- I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE AND I HAVE TO WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH DOCTOR PAN. WILL BEGIN THEN WITH YOUR TWO PRIMARY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. IF YOU COULD KINDLY WOULD LIMIT YOUR TESTIMONY TO NO MORE THAN TWO MINUTES EACH. AND WILL BEGIN WITH DOCTOR GERRY RICH WALLED. GOOD MORNING SHARE LOW AND ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS DR GERRY RICH WALLED I'M A PHYSICIAN AND COMMUNICABLE DISEASE EXPERT. FORMER DIRECTOR IN CHIEF POSITION OF L. A. COUNTY AS THE PROGRAM THE LARGEST. IN THE COUNTRY AND I TEACH AT THE EPIDEMIOLOGY AT THE USC TECH SCHOOL OF MEDICINE CURRENTLY. CALIFORNIA HAS NOT DEPEND SAID FIVE SELF AND UNFORTUNATE PREDICAMENT. IN THE MIDST OF A SERIES OF STD EPIDEMIC SINCE THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND TEN. WITH THAT INCREASES OVER THAT TIME PERIOD. UP THREEFOLD IN THE FULLEST TO SPALDING GONORRHEA. AND CHLAMYDIA BY HALF AGAIN AND WHAT DOCTOR PAN SAID WHICH I WANT TO RE EMPHASIZE. IS THAT WE'VE HAD A TEN FOLD INCREASE IN CONGENITAL SYPHILIS WHICH MEANS THAT PREGNANT MOTHERS AND THE MOST VULNERABLE FUTURE CALIFORNIA IS THAT IS. THAT IS NEWBORNS AND FETUSES. END UP WITH A DEBILITATING OR FATAL ILLNESS THAT IS FULLY PREVENTABLE. SO HOW DOES THIS BILL ADDRESSED THE ISSUE NUMBER ONE INCREASES EXPEDITED PARTNER THERAPY SO IF YOU HAVE GONORRHEA. INFECTED YOU GET MEDICATION THAT YOU CAN GIVE TO YOUR SEX PARTNERS SO THEY CAN BE TREATED AS WELL. THIS IS DONE IN CLOSE TO FIFTY STATES IN THE UNITED STATES NUMBER TWO IT REQUIRES THAT THE SCREENING IN THE THIRD TRIMESTER OF PREGNANCY. I WAS HEAD OF THE TEAM THAT USED THEIR IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES TO ADDRESS OUR PREVIOUS CONGENITAL SYPHILIS EPIDEMIC AND IT WAS A CRITICAL TOOL IN BRINGING THAT UNDER CONTROL AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST DURING THE CALL THAT THE DAMAGE. WE'VE SEEN IN MANY AREAS A 90% REDUCTION IN SCREENING FOR STDS AND IDENTIFICATION OF INDIVIDUALS. WHO ARE INFECTED SO THEY CAN BE TREATED. SB THREE OH SIX LEVELS THE PLAYING FIELD. DURING THE CALL THAT EPIDEMIC PEOPLE HAVE TO PAY OUT OF POCKET. TO DO REMOTE TESTING IN THEIR WHOLE COLLECTING SPECIMENS AND A SENDING THEM INTO THE LABORATORY. THIS BILL REQUIRES THAT INSURANCE COMPANIES PAY FOR REMOTE HOME COLLECTION WHICH USES NEW TECHNOLOGY YOU KNOW USES WELL ESTABLISHED NEW TECHNOLOGY. TO ACHIEVE AN IMPORTANT GOAL SO S. C. THE THREE CHARACTERS THE SB THREE OF SIX IS AN IMPORTANT STEP TOWARDS CREATING AN EQUITABLE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. SO THAT INDIVIDUALS HAVE MUCH BETTER ACCESS TO STD TESTING AND TREATMENT. FOR ALL OF THESE REASONS I URGE YOU TO VOTE YES ON SB THREE OF SIX. THANK YOU VERY MUCH DOCTOR RECALLED WE NOW HAVE A SECOND PRIMARY WITNESS IN SUPPORT. REPRESENTING THE BLACK WOMEN FOR WELLNESS ACTION PROJECT. GOOD MORNING PARENTS MEMBERS MY NAME IS WILLIAM AGAIN I'M REPRESENTING BLACK ONES ONE IS ACTUALLY PROJECT WE ARE REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE KIEDY BASED ORGANIZATION WITH OFFICES IN LOS ANGELES AND STOCKTON AND ARE COMMITTED TO IMPROVING THE OVERALL HEALTH STATUS AND WELL BEING A BLACK WOMEN AND GIRLS. FOR DECADES CALIFORNIANS IN THE STEADY INCREASE AND WE'VE HEARD IN THE RATES OF STI AND CURRENT DATA TELLS US THAT THESE DIAGNOSES ARE NOW THE HIGHEST IN THIRTY YEARS. YOU BLACK FOLKS IN LGBTQ PLUS FOLK BEAR THE DISPROPORTIONATE BURDEN OF DETECTION THESE THESE FIGURES THESE RISING STI RATES IN OUR STATE ARE NOT ONLY EMBLEMATIC OF THE SHORTCOMINGS OF OUR INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE WAY IT IS FILLED OUR COMMUNITY. PARTICULARLY THOSE WHO ARE MARGINALIZED THEY ARE CANARIAN THE COAL MINE EARLY WARNINGS OF THE GREAT IMPACT FOR PUBLIC HEALTH SHOULD WE FAIL TO IMPLEMENT INTERVENTIONS THAT ARE INNOVATIVE AND RESPONSIVE TO THE ISSUES ARE FACTORS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO THE STAGGERING RATE. CRITICAL ISSUES SUCH AS LACK OF ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE AND LACK OF ECONOMIC MOBILITY INCARCERATIONS WE'VE HEARD THE SOBERING FIGURES EARLIER PRESENTATION ENSURING ACCESS TO TESTING AND TREATMENT ARE KEY TO EFFECTIVELY ATTRACTING CALIFORNIA YEAH I CRISIS. SB THREE OH SIX DOES JUST THAT AS WE'VE HEARD BY AMONG OTHER THINGS ENCOURAGING THAT EXPEDITED PARTNER THERAPY TREATMENT A PRACTICE BEING DEFECTIVE FOR PARTNER MANAGEMENT BY THE CDC EXPANDING ACCESS TO AT HOME TESTING AS WELL AS UPDATED BEFORE TESTING PROTOCOLS FOR PREGNANT PEOPLE. THIS IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT GIVEN THAT 50% OF PEOPLE WITH THE FOLKS IN THE STATE ARE PREGNANT IN FACT CONGENITAL SYPHILIS INCREASED 40% NATIONWIDE WITH 25% OF THOSE CASES FROM CALIFORNIA ALONE. I MEAN LOOK CAN BE TREATED WITH ANTIBIOTICS THAT COST LESS THAN A DOLLAR SO BOLSTERING OUR SCREENING PROTOCOLS SUCH THAT SO THAT WE CAN DETECT TREAT AND PREVENT IS CRITICAL AS LACK OF TREATMENT IN THE ALTERNATIVE CAN RESULT IN PERMANENT DAMAGE. CALIFORNIANS CERTAINLY MADE STRIDES TO EXPAND ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE HOWEVER JACKSON ACCESS TO STI SCREENING. AND TREATMENT PROCESS WE HAVE THE TOOLS TO REVERSE THE UPWARD. TREND AND WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO INTERVENE CALIFORNIA TO THE AND- IN OUR- PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE SO IT'S TO ENSURE. ACCESS TO CARE AND BECAUSE THAT. FOR THOSE THREE THEN I DO.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH BELIEVE THE ROLE OPEN FOR ADDITIONAL MEMBERS THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH EXPECT CULTIVABAN TO FILE ITEM NUMBER SIX THIS IS SB. FIVE TWENTY FOUR BY SENATOR SKINNER. SENATE SKINNER PLEASE FEEL FREE PERCENT MURDER READY WELCOME. THANK YOU CHAIR THANK YOU MEMBERS. FIRST I'D LIKE TO- EXCEPT THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS WHICH CLARIFIED THAT THE FINANCIAL INCENTIVES. CAN BE COMMUNICATED TO PATIENTS AND- REMOVES THE LANGUAGE ALLOWING PHARMACIES TO OFFER. PRICE MATCHING FOR THOSE FINANCIAL INCENTIVES I APPRECIATE THE GOOD WORK WITH THE COMMITTEE ON- THE POINT OF SB FIVE TWENTY FOUR. IS TO ALLOW PATIENTS TO USE THE IN NETWORK PHARMACY OF THEIR CHOICE AS MANY OF US KNOW WE MAY HAVE A LONG TERM RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR PHARMACIST THERE MAY BE AN IN NETWORK PHARMACY CLOSE BY. THERE COULD BE ANY NUMBER OF REASONS WHY WE PREFERRED THE IN NETWORK PHARMACIES. HOWEVER THERE'S BECOME A TREND WHERE- PATIENTS BENEFIT MANAGERS THAT SOME- PRESCRIPTION BENEFIT MANAGERS RATHER. TRY TO STEER. THE PATIENT TO A SPECIFIC PHARMACY AND IMPLY THAT THEY HAVE NO CHOICE BUT ONLY TO USE THAT PHARMACY. SO WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS BASICALLY OF COURSE THE PRESCRIPTION BENEFIT MANAGER CAN STILL OFFER A DISCOUNT TO THE PHARMACY OF THEIR CHOOSING THEY CAN DO A VARIETY OF THINGS- BUT IF THE IF THE PATIENT'S STILL WANTS TO USE THE IN NETWORK PHARMACY OF THEIR CHOOSING. THEY CAN'T SO THAT'S THE PURPOSE OF IT AND LET ME HAVE MY WITNESSES JIM GROSS FROM CALIFORNIA PHARMACISTS ASSOCIATION AND CREEK POSTER FOR FROM A PL A HEALTH TEST BY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR SKINNER. LET'S MOVE ON TO PRIMARY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. LIMIT YOUR TESTIMONY TO NO MORE THAN TWO MINUTES. OUR MEDICARE MEMBERS JIM GROSS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA PHARMACISTS ASSOCIATION PERSONA THANK MR K<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt; FOR VERY HARD&lt;/c&gt;</u> WORK OVER THE LAST WEEK- WORKING ON AMENDMENTS AND REACHING A POINT WHERE WE HAVE ACCOMMODATED SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION- AS SENATOR- SKINNER SAID- THIS IS NEVER GOING PRACTICE BY LARGE- CONGLOMERATES- THAT ARE TRYING TO CONTROL. THE DISPENSING OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS THROUGH THEIR- BRICK AND MORTAR PHARMACIES AND THROUGH THEIR MAIL ORDER AND WHILE WE RECOGNIZE THAT- THERE IS VALUE TO BOTH MAIL ORDER IN SOME OF THE PHARMACIES OWNED BY- THESE GLOBAL CONGLOMERATES- WE DO NOT BELIEVE IT'S IN THE PATIENT'S BEST INTEREST. TO ARBITRARILY STEER THEM AWAY FROM THE PHARMACIES THAT THEY HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH AND- INCONVENIENCE THEM RISK THEIR HEALTH SIX CETERA- WELL WE'VE TRIED TO CRAFT IS BLOWN AWAY THAT BALANCES I KNOW THAT SOME OF YOU HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT- THIS WILL EXPAND THE ABILITY TO- HANDLE SPECIALTY MEDICATIONS YOU'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT LET ME MAKE SURE YOU UNDERSTAND. THERE'S NOTHING A CALIFORNIA LAW THAT LIMITS THE ABILITY OF PHARMACIES DEVELOP DISPENSED ACTUALLY TRUCKS THE LIMITS ARE BOTH TECHNOLOGICAL AND LOGISTICAL AND THOSE WILL REMAIN THERE ARE SOME PHARMACIES THAT WILL NOT BE ABLE TO DO CERTAIN THINGS THAT WILL BE APPROPRIATE THEN TO HAVE THOSE PATIENTS GO TO OTHER PHARMACIES. BUT THE OPPOSITION HIDES BEHIND THE TERM SPECIALTY WHAT THEY MEAN AND WHAT THEY ALWAYS MANAGED BY AND LARGE WHEN THEY SAY THAT IS EXPENSIVE. AND THEY ANT TO CONTROL THE DISPENSING OF EXPENSIVE DRUGS AND JUST BECAUSE A DRUG IS EXPENSIVE AND THEREFORE DESIGNATED STRICTLY DRUG DOES NOT MEAN THAT OTHER PHARMACIES CANNOT DISPENSE IT IN FACT IN MANY INSTANCES HAVE ALREADY BEEN DISPENSING IT WHEN THE- PBM STEP IN AND SAY- WE WANT YOU TO GO SOMEWHERE ELSE. BUT WE THINK THIS BILL IS REPRO CONSUMER AND WE ASKED HIM YES WELL THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR MUCH WE'LL MOVE ON TO OUR SAID WITNESS IN SOME. REPRESENTING P. L. A. GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS CRACKPOTS A PER ON BEHALF OF A QUE LA HEALTH PLAN AT UHC IN ONE OF THE LARGEST HIV SERVICE PROVIDERS AND L. A. COUNTY- TODAY I'M JUST GOING TO FOCUS MY COMMENTS ON HOW PATIENTS DURING IMPACTS. PEOPLE WITH HIV AND OTHER CHRONIC CONDITIONS. MOST IMPORTANTLY THIS PRACTICE UNDERMINES THE REALLY CRITICAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PATIENTS ON THE APARTMENT THAT. MANY PATIENTS DEPENDS ON THIS PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP SOMETIMES SOMEONE THEY'VE KNOWN FOR YEARS TO PROVIDE ACCURATE INFORMATION. ABOUT SIDE EFFECTS AND TO HELP THEM REMAIN INSURANCE THEIR MEDICATION. THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE FOR PEOPLE WITH HIV. AND OTHER CHRONIC CONDITION. PATIENTS HEARING COULD ALSO CREATE SIGNIFICANT PRIVACY ISSUES ESPECIALLY FOR YOUNG PEOPLE. OF PEOPLE EXPERIENCING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND THOSE LIVING IN MORE RURAL AREAS. IF THE PATIENT CAN'T PICK UP THEIR MEDICATION AT THE PHARMACY OF CHOICE. AND ESPECIALLY IF THEY ARE REQUIRED TO USE MAIL ORDER. SOMEONE COULD FIND OUT ABOUT THEIR MEDICAL CONDITION WHICH OF COURSE COULD HAVE DISASTROUS CONSEQUENCES. AND IT CREEK LIKELY. FOR THESE REASONS THE MANDATORY MAIL ORDER HAS LONG BEEN RECOGNIZED TO BE AN APPROPRIATE. AND EVEN UNLAWFUL FOR PEOPLE WITH HIV- AND LASTLY JUST WANT TO STRESS THE IMPORTANCE OF PATIENTS BEING ABLE TO PICK UP THEIR MEDICATION. AT A PHARMACY WHERE APARTMENTS TO SPEAK THEIR LANGUAGE AND WHERE THEY KNOW THEY WILL RECEIVE CULTURALLY COMPETENT CARE. AS A SURPRISE TO NO ONE ON THE COMMITTEE NOT HAVING THAT CULTURALLY COMPETENT PROVIDER. IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST REASONS THE PEOPLE FALL OUT OF CARE. THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE FOR LGBT PEOPLE AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. AND PATIENTS MUST HAVE THE OPTION TO RECEIVE THEIR MEDICATION. FROM THE PHARMACY WHERE THEY KNOW THEY WILL RECEIVE CULTURALLY COMPETENT CARE. THANK YOU AND I RESPECTFULLY URGE. YOUR SUPPORT PRESS PEACOCK TWENTY FOUR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I'M WOULD YOU PLEASE OPEN THE LINES FOR ADDITIONAL MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC NOW JUST SIMPLY TO SIGNIFY THEIR SUPPORT. THANK YOU PRESS ONE ZERO PLEASE- SILVERLIGHT AND NUMBER FORTY THREE ISRAEL HAD.

GOOD AFTERNOON SHARE GONZALEZ ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ON IT HERE COALITION IS STRONG SUPPORT. AND CURRENTLY NO FURTHER IN Q. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SEEN ADDITIONAL MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC HERE IN THE CHAMBERS WISHING TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT WILL NOW MOVE ON TO OPPOSITION. WHEN I MOVE ONTO PRIMARY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION PLEASE LIMIT YOUR TESTIMONY TOMORROW MORE THAN TWO MINUTES. WILL BEGIN WITH A BILL HEAD FROM THE DIVORCE WHERE TO FOUNDATION. YOUR LOADMASTER FLOW FLOW AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS BILL HAVE A POSSIBLE CARE MANAGEMENT ASSOCIATION. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY IN APOSITION OF FIVE POINT SB FIVE TWENTY FOUR TODAY I DO WANT TO BEGIN BY THANKING BOTH THE CHAIR AND MR CHI FOR ALL THE WORK ON THE AMENDMENTS. AND THE BILL AND THE VIRTUAL OPEN DOOR THROUGHOUT THIS PROCESS IS VERY MUCH APPRECIATED. HOWEVER WE CONTINUE TO HAVE A CONCERN WITH THE UNDERLYING BILL. FOR TWO REASONS ONE IT IS IT TAKES AWAY ONE OF THE IMPORTANT COST SAVINGS TOOLS. AVAILABLE TO HELP PLANS PROVIDED BY PBMS THAT ENABLE THEM TO STRESS THEIR HEALTHCARE DOLLARS AS FAR AS POSSIBLE- UNDER THE GUIDANCE OF YOU KNOW PATIENTS DURING- WHICH WE DISAGREE WITH THE PREMISE EVEN EXISTING. IT REALLY COMES DOWN TO THE MARKET SHARE TRYING TO GET MORE THE MARKET SHARE SO LET'S HAVE A LET'S HAVE AN OPEN DISCUSSION ABOUT THAT BUT NOT DO IT UNDER THE GUISE OF SOMETHING THAT SIMPLY DOESN'T EXIST- SO. ALL OF THOSE TOOLS GOING TO AT THE OF THE DAY. IMPACT PREMIUM AND COST FOR PATIENTS. THAT WITH RESPECT TO. CARE THE- IT WAS MENTIONED ABOUT HAAS- IMPACTING THE DEFINITION SPECIALLY GET. I WOULDN'T I WOULD ADD THAT. IT'S A RATHER THAT COST THE ONLY THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT USES IN ITS DEFINITION. OF ESPECIALLY TRUCKS SO WE THINK IT IS RELEVANT FOR THIS DEFINITION TO BE CONSISTENT WITH FEDERAL REGULATIONS AS WELL. ALSO SPECIALLY PHARMACIES- OPEN PPO CONTRACTS THAT REQUIRED TO RECEIVE NATIONAL INDEPENDENT UNIFORM ACCREDITATION STANDARDS. AND THE PURPOSE OF THE STANDARDS IS TO PROVIDE PATIENT PROTECTION. SO IN THE ABSENCE OF THESE GIVE US CONCERN IN THE DEFINITION OF POTENTIALLY OPENING THE DOOR FOR A NETWORK PHARMACY TO DISPENSE WITH SPECIALLY DRUGS EVEN THOUGH IT IS NOT BEEN ACCREDITED. AND CONTRACTED HAS A SPECIALTY PHARMACY AND FOR THESE REASONS WE ARE SO COMMITTEE TO VOTE NO ON THE BILL THANK YOU MESSAGES THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR MOVE ON TO PRESTON YOUNG WITH THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE. YES GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS PRESS ANY ON FROM THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE HERE TODAY IN OPPOSITION TO SB FIVE TWENTY FOUR PERSON FOREMOST I'D LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE. INVESTORS SHE FOR THE HARD WORK TIME AND CONSIDERATION OF THIS BILL WE DO REMAIN OPPOSED TO SB FIVE TWENTY FOUR AND WHAT IS IN PRINT TODAY. THE OVERARCHING CONCERN THAT WE HAVE WITH THE BILL IS THAT WOULD IT WOULD IT WOULD GIVE ROAD THE INCENTIVE EMPLOYERS HEALTH PLANS AND INSURERS HAVE TO DESIGN A PARTICIPATING PHARMACY NETWORKS. NETWORKS INCLUDE MAIL ORDER PHARMACIES CHAIN PHARMACIES AND INDEPENDENT PHARMACIES. MAY HELP CONTROL PHARMACEUTICAL COSTS FOR PATIENTS IN ADDITION TO HEALTHCARE PREMIUMS FOR EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEES. SB FIVE TWENTY FOUR DISRUPTORS BENEFIT DESIGN AND THE CHOICES PLAN PARTICIPANTS MAKE TO REDUCE PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS WHICH ARE SUBSTANTIAL. ACCORDING TO THE DMH C. IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN PRESCRIPTION DRUGS ACCOUNTED FOR TWELVE POINT 7% OF TOTAL HEALTH PLAN PREMIUMS. THE NUMBER OF PATIENTS IN THESE NETWORKS ARE REDUCED THE COST CONTROLS WILL BE WEAKENED AND UNFORTUNATELY WELL AS BEFORE TWENTY FOURTH WELL INTENTIONED. THE LACK OF THE HEALTHCARE COSTS RIGHT. IN ADDITION ARE COST CONCERNS SB FIVE TWENTY FOUR. IS ALSO OF CONCERN AND- WE ARE IN OPPOSITION BECAUSE IT HELPS TO REGULATE HEALTH SELF INSURED PLANS DESIGNED TO BENEFIT THIS IS AN AREA SPACE GOVERNED BY ARISSA AND IT'S FEDERALLY PREEMPTED. SO FOR THESE REASONS WE ARE OPPOSED SB. FIVE TWENTY FOUR THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME TO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. NUMBER OF TO MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WISHING TO SIGNIFY THEIR OPPOSITION ON THE PHONE LINES OPERATE IF WE TO PLEASE OPEN THE LINES. FOR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WISHING TO SIGNIFY THEIR OPPOSITION.

NEXT WE ARE LINE OF FIFTY I'M SORRY THIRTY FIVE PLEASE GO AHEAD. GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN BIRTH MIKE MONEY GOING TO BE OUT THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF ELECTRICAL WORKERS. CALIFORNIA STATE PIPE TRADES COUNCIL AND THE LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL OF SHEET METAL WORKERS. OUR CONCERN IS THAT THE BILL WOULD CIRCUMVENT THE RICH THE PREEMPTION OF OUR UNIONS TRUST FUNDS THANK YOU. NEXT IN THE LINE OF FIFTY FOUR PLEASE GO AHEAD. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS THIS IS ERIN REID BURKE ON BEHALF OF THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA LIFE AND HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANIES AND PERFECT COMPETITION. AND CURRENTLY NO FURTHER IN Q. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SEE NO DIGITAL MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION HERE IN THE CHAMBERS. THE NUMBER OF THE CONVERSATION BACK TO MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS HELLO BEGIN WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER FONG FOLLOWED BY SOME REMEMBER CHECK. I THINK IT WAS CHAIR OF I JUST WANT TO THANKS EVERY SKINNER FOR THE IN DISCUSSION ON THIS ISSUE- THIS BILL PROVIDES. A CONSUMER CHOICE WHILE SUPPORTING LOCAL PHARMACIES THAT BEST SERVE THE NEEDS. OF MANY ROLE IN DISPATCH COMMITTEES OF EXPORTING THIS BILL TODAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SUMMER FONG. THE TAKE THAT MAYBE PERHAPS OF THE MOTION. GREAT A SIMILAR CHECK UP THANK YOU MR APPRECIATE YOUR TIME A REAL ONE THANK ALSO CENTER SKINNER FOR THE OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION. I DO HAVE SOME QUESTIONS AS REALLY APPRECIATE INTENT OF THE BILL TO ADD ADDITIONAL ABILITY FOR PEOPLE UTILIZE MEDICATION. I ALSO UNDERSTAND TO THIS ON THE OPPOSITION'S CONCERNS. THAT WHEN THE ISSUES AND POINTS OF CONTENTION IS. UTILIZATION ESPECIALLY MEDICATIONS SO AS I UNDERSTAND IN ORDER FOR YOU TO BE. A SMASH ISSUES MAY SPECIALTY MEDICATION PROVIDER ONE HAS TO GO THROUGH AN ACCREDITED ACCREDITATION PROCESS AND IT IS CENTER PATIENT SAFETY AND QUALITY PURPOSES. FOR THE PHARMACIES THAT HAVE NOT RECEIVED THIS ACCREDITATION. IS THERE AN ISSUE IN TERMS OF PATIENT SAFETY QUALITY- DISPENSING- IF YOU COULD- ASSISTANT THE ANSWER THIS QUESTION APPRECIATED SENATOR. THROUGH THE CHAIR PLEASE SEVEN Q. THE BILL IF THE- IF THE PARTICULAR PRESCRIPTION CANNOT BE FILLED BY- THE PHARMACY OF THE PATIENT'S CHOICE UNDER THIS BILL AND IF IT MAY OR MAY NOT BE A SPECIALTY DRUG IT COULD BE A DIFFERENT IT COULD. THERE IS A VARIETY OF THAT EITHER COMPOUNDED DRUGS ARE SUCH THAT MAY NOT BE ABLE TO BE FILLED BY A SAY IN INDEPENDENT PHARMACY IN THE PHARMACY OF THE PATIENT'S CHOICE SO OF COURSE THEN THAT SPECIALTY PHARMACY WOULD BE UTILIZED AND THERE'S NOTHING IN THE BILL THAT WOULD PREVENT THAT. AT ALL. THANK YOU SENATOR. AND I ALSO HAVE ANOTHER QUESTION- I ALSO UNDERSTAND ONE OF THE POINTS OF CONTENTION. FOR THE PHARMACIES RELATES THE DEFINITION OF A NETWORK SPECIALTY PHARMACY SPECIFICALLY. WITH THE PURPOSE TO ENSURE BE CONSISTENT WITH THE STRANGE DEMANDS IMPOSED ON PHARMACIES BY PBMS IMPLANTS. GIVEN THE HIGH COSTS AND SINCE THE NATURE OF THE MEDICATIONS. GIVEN THAT IN MIND- CENTER HAS THERE BEEN CONSIDERATIONS AND DOCKING LANGUAGE. RELATING TO THE DEFINITION OF A NETWORK SPECIALTY PHARMACY- SINCE THIS BILL ALLOWS FOR IN NETWORK PHARMACIES S. DEFINED BY THE HEALTH INSURER. WE DID NOT FEEL THE NECESSITY TO ADD FURTHER- DEFINITION AND IN TERMS OF THAT ARGUMENT AROUND COST SO YOU KNOW LET'S BE PRACTICAL THIS BILL MAY BENEFIT SOME INDEPENDENT PHARMACIES HOWEVER THERE ARE SO FEW INDEPENDENT PHARMACIES REMAINING IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THEY ARE CERTAINLY NOT THE DRIVERS OF HIGH PRESCRIPTION COSTS- SO TO. TO IN THE FEW CASES WHERE A PATIENT WOULD CHOOSE EITHER BECAUSE SAY THEY LIVE IN A RURAL AREA AND THE ONLY PHARMACY NEARBY IS THAT INDEPENDENT PHARMACY OR THEY HAVE A LONG TERM RELATIONSHIP WITH THAT INDEPENDENT FIRMS. SO AS LONG AS THEY'RE IN NETWORK IN A FEW CASES WHERE THE PATIENT IS GOING TO UTILIZE THAT PHARMACY INSTEAD OF. THE ONE THAT THE PBM MIGHT PREFER THEM TO USE IS NO WAY THAT THAT IS DRIVING THE COST OF PRESCRIPTIONS IN THE STATE. AND DINNER REALLY PRISONER TIME THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS AT THIS TIME ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRAYSON THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND THANK YOU TO THE AUTHOR FOR YOUR GOOD WORK ON THIS BILL- THERE IS- A PART WHERE IT TALKS ABOUT- A VERY NARROW EXEMPTIONS SPECIALTY DRUGS- WITH IN THE DEFINITION OF- PATIENT STEERING RIGHT AND DOES THAT ALIGN OR OR CREATE A CONFLICT BETWEEN. THE AGREEMENTS BETWEEN PBMS AND PHARMACIES. WELL DONE. NOT TO MY KNOWLEDGE. AND CERTAINLY WAS NOT BROUGHT OUT FAR EITHER IN ANALYSIS OR- AND PARTLY BECAUSE CLEARLY IF YOU CANNOT IF THE SPECIALTY DRUG THAT YOU HAVE BEEN PRESCRIBED CANNOT BE FILLED BY THE PHARMACY THAT YOU MAY BE YOUR CHOICE. YOU OBVIOUSLY WOULD NEED TO GO TO THE SPECIALTY PHARMACY THAT THE PRESCRIPTION BENEFIT MANAGER HAS CHOSEN SO. THE- HI I HAVE A DIFFICULT TIME UNDERSTANDING WHAT IS PERCEIVED TO BE A CONFLICT THERE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR ANSWER THANKS FOR YOUR WORKTHANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH AS OUR GRAYSON AND ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS AT THIS TIME. SENATOR SKINNER JEWISH TO CLOSE THANK YOU I'M I WOULD JUST SAY IN MY CLOSING THAT I FOUND IT INTERESTING TO HAVE THE CHAMBER OPPOSE. THE BILL BECAUSE IN WHILE IT IS BEEN CHARACTERIZED THAT THE BILL IS CONSUMER FRIENDLY WHICH IT IS IT IS ALSO VERY BUSINESS FRIENDLY. NOW WHY ITS BUSINESS FRIENDLY IS BECAUSE- IT SUPPORTS AND WE THE LEGISLATURE PURPORT TO SUPPORT SMALL BUSINESSES. BUT WHAT IT DOES IS HELP TO ENSURE. THAT IN THOSE FEW CASES WHERE. THE PATIENT WANTS TO USE THE INDEPENDENT PHARMACIST IF THAT INDEPENDENT PHARMACIST IS IN THE NETWORK. THEY CAN DO SO. AND THE PRESCRIPTION BENEFIT MANAGER CANNOT EXCLUDE THEM. AND SO IN OTHER WORDS IT'S SUPPORTING OUR SMALL BUSINESSES NOW OVER TIME WE MAY FIND A SITUATION. WHERE MANY OF OUR HEALTH INSURERS DO NOT INCLUDE INDEPENDENT PHARMACIES IN THE NETWORK. BUT WHILE THEY ARE IN THE NETWORK. THEN WE SHOULD NOT HAVE LAWS THAT IN EFFECT. FURTHER DISCRIMINATE AGAINST THEM OTHER THAN OUR CHOI YOU KNOW THAN. WHATEVER OTHER MARKET FORCES MAY MAY AFFECT THEIR EXISTENCE- AND WITH THAT I ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS AS AMENDED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH CENTER SKINNER FOR ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE MADMAN'S UNITE COMMITTEE COMMUNICATED ALSO OVER THE HOLIDAY WEEKEND ON THIS AND SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR HARD WORK AND DEDICATION FOR YOU SPECIFICALLY AS THE AUTHOR AS WELL AS YOUR DEDICATED STAFF.
