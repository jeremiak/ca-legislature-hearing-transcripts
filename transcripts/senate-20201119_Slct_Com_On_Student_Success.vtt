WHEN WE BEGAN THIS IS THE

00:16:18.210 --> 00:16:19.912
HIGHEST RATE IN THE HISTORY FOR

00:16:19.978 --> 00:16:20.946
THE C. ISSUE WHEN THEY BUILD ON

00:16:21.013 --> 00:16:22.648
THE MOMENTUM THAT WE HAVE

00:16:22.715 --> 00:16:23.749
GAINED OVER THE YEARS AND

00:16:23.816 --> 00:16:25.250

GOAL OF FORTY PERCENT. ON ONE

00:16:29.688 --> 00:16:30.989
ALSO MENTIONED THAT THE C.

RATE IS NOW AT 62% WHICH IS ON

00:16:46.872 --> 00:16:48.240
PAR WITH THE NATIONAL AVERAGE

00:16:48.307 --> 00:16:49.641
FOR PUBLIC FOUR YEAR

00:16:49.708 --> 00:16:52.845
UNIVERSITIES. TWO YEAR TRANSFER

00:16:52.911 --> 00:16:54.880
RATE SOMETHING THAT IS ALSO

00:16:54.947 --> 00:16:56.749
VERY IMPORTANT TO US-

00:16:56.815 --> 00:16:58.617
PERCENTAGE OF STUDENTS WHO ARE

00:16:58.684 --> 00:17:00.586
GRADUATING TWO YEARS AFTER

00:17:00.652 --> 00:17:02.020
TRANSFERRING TO THE C. ISSUE

00:17:02.087 --> 00:17:03.756
NOW STANDS AT FORTY FOUR

00:17:03.822 --> 00:17:06.091
PERCENT. AGAIN THE HIGHEST EVER

00:17:06.158 --> 00:17:07.659
FOR THE C. ISSUE IN JUST ONE

00:17:07.726 --> 00:17:11.663
PERCENTAGE POINT AWAY. FROM OUR

00:17:11.730 --> 00:17:12.431
TWENTY TWENTY FIVE GOAL. THE

00:17:12.498 --> 00:17:14.833
FOR YOUR TRAIN RATE OPERAR A

00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:16.535
STUDENTS WHO COME TO THE CSU OR

00:17:16.602 --> 00:17:18.504
GRADUATING- FOUR YEARS LATER IS

00:17:18.570 --> 00:17:22.040
NOW 79% ALSO THE HIGHEST EVER.

00:17:22.107 --> 00:17:23.909
AND AS YOU KNOW SENATOR BEFORE

00:17:23.976 --> 00:17:25.744
GRADUATION INITIATIVE THE CSU

00:17:25.811 --> 00:17:27.379
TRANSFER STUDENT COMPLETION

00:17:27.446 --> 00:17:28.981
RATES WERE ALREADY AMONG THE

00:17:29.048 --> 00:17:31.183
HIGHEST IN THE NATION. COMPARED

00:17:31.250 --> 00:17:33.018
TO PEER INSTITUTIONS WITH

00:17:33.085 --> 00:17:34.620
CONTINUED INVESTMENT IN

00:17:34.686 --> 00:17:37.055
STRATEGIC FOCUS CAMPUSES HAVE

00:17:37.122 --> 00:17:38.590
ENHANCED THEIR SUPPORT OF

00:17:38.657 --> 00:17:40.993
TRANSFER STUDENTS FURTHER

00:17:41.059 --> 00:17:42.795
AUGMENTING THEIR SUCCESS.

00:17:42.861 --> 00:17:44.430
ANOTHER NOTABLE MILESTONE AS

00:17:44.496 --> 00:17:46.965
YOU MENTIONED- WHICH IS

00:17:47.032 --> 00:17:49.067
PARTICULARLY RELEVANT GIVEN THE

00:17:49.134 --> 00:17:52.004
PANDEMIC IS A C. ISSUE POSTED

00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:54.006
ITS HIGHEST EVER RETENTION RATE

00:17:54.072 --> 00:17:55.274
AT EIGHTY FIVE AND A HALF

00:17:55.340 --> 00:17:56.642
PERCENT. FOR FIRST YEAR

00:17:56.708 --> 00:17:58.544
STUDENTS WERE RETURNING FOR

00:17:58.610 --> 00:18:00.379
THEIR SECOND TERM. WELL AS YOU

00:18:00.446 --> 00:18:03.081
KNOW AND YOU HAD MENTIONED- THE

00:18:03.148 --> 00:18:05.050
C. ISSUE IS ONLY ONE OF A

00:18:05.117 --> 00:18:06.351
HANDFUL OF INSTITUTIONS

00:18:06.418 --> 00:18:08.754
NATIONWIDE. THAT IS PUBLICLY

00:18:08.821 --> 00:18:10.722
DECLARED THE GOAL OF NOT

00:18:10.789 --> 00:18:14.726
CLOSING BUT ELIMINATING EQUITY

00:18:14.793 --> 00:18:16.128
GAPS. THAT WOULD CELEBRATE THE

00:18:16.195 --> 00:18:17.095
GAME THAT WE AVE MADE IN

00:18:17.162 --> 00:18:19.798
GRADUATION RATES WE ALSO NOW.

00:18:19.865 --> 00:18:21.700
THAT OUR SUCCESS IS NOT TRULY

00:18:21.767 --> 00:18:24.036
COMPLETE AND LOTS OF REPRESENTS

00:18:24.102 --> 00:18:26.605
SUCCESS FOR ALL STUDENTS

00:18:26.672 --> 00:18:28.574
INCLUDING OUR MOST VULNERABLE.

00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:30.108
WHAT THE SAME INTENSE FOCUS WE

00:18:30.175 --> 00:18:31.243
HAVE PLACED ON MOVING THE

00:18:31.310 --> 00:18:33.045
NEEDLE ON GRADUATION RATES WE

00:18:33.111 --> 00:18:35.848
MUST NOW RENEW OUR COMMITMENT

00:18:35.914 --> 00:18:38.150
TO ELIMINATING EQUITY GAPS THAT

00:18:38.217 --> 00:18:40.018
EXIST TODAY. THIS YEAR WE CAN

00:18:40.085 --> 00:18:41.253
REPORT THAT THE GAP IN

00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:43.155
GRADUATION RATES BETWEEN PELL

00:18:43.222 --> 00:18:44.656
ELIGIBLE STUDENTS AND THEIR

00:18:44.723 --> 00:18:48.126
PEERS IS NINE POINT 2% THE GAP

00:18:48.193 --> 00:18:50.295
CLOSED BY ONE PERCENTAGE POINT

00:18:50.362 --> 00:18:52.297
COMPARED TO LAST YEAR. FOR

00:18:52.364 --> 00:18:53.298
STUDENTS WHO IDENTIFY AS

00:18:53.365 --> 00:18:54.600
AFRICAN AMERICAN NATIVE

00:18:54.666 --> 00:18:56.869
AMERICAN OR LATIN ACTS WE ALSO

00:18:56.935 --> 00:18:58.670
SAW THE EQUITY GP NARAL

00:18:58.737 --> 00:18:59.805
BETWEEN THE STUDENTS AND THEIR

00:18:59.872 --> 00:19:02.007
PEERS FROM ELEVEN POINT ONE

00:19:02.074 --> 00:19:04.510
PERCENTAGE POINTS LAST YEAR TO

00:19:04.576 --> 00:19:05.777
TEN POINT FIVE PERCENTAGE

00:19:05.844 --> 00:19:07.946
POINTS THIS YEAR. THESE NUMBERS

00:19:08.013 --> 00:19:09.548
WALL ALTHOUGH INCREMENTAL

00:19:09.615 --> 00:19:11.316
REPRESENT FAR FOUGHT

00:19:11.383 --> 00:19:13.919
IMPROVEMENTS FROM LAST YEAR AND

00:19:13.986 --> 00:19:16.321
REFLECT OUR ONGOING COMMITMENT

00:19:16.388 --> 00:19:18.290
TO STUDENTS ARE TO ELIMINATE

00:19:18.357 --> 00:19:21.426
EQUITY GAPS DRIVEN BY A BETTER

00:19:21.493 --> 00:19:23.862
AND MORE SOPHISTICATED DATA AN

00:19:23.929 --> 00:19:27.132
EQUITY DRIVEN POLICIES. WHAT IS

00:19:27.199 --> 00:19:28.734
THE ISSUE IS ACCOMPLISHED OVER

00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:30.502
THE PAST FIVE YEARS AS

00:19:30.569 --> 00:19:32.070
RIGHTFULLY GAIN LOCAL AND

00:19:32.137 --> 00:19:33.605
NATIONAL ATTENTION IT IT IS

00:19:33.672 --> 00:19:36.041
TRULY EXTRAORDINARY CHANGE FOR

00:19:36.108 --> 00:19:37.776
SUCH A LARGE AND COMPLEX

00:19:37.843 --> 00:19:40.112
UNIVERSITY SYSTEM. HOWEVER WE

00:19:40.178 --> 00:19:42.714
ARE CLEAR THAT THERE IS MORE

00:19:42.781 --> 00:19:44.783
WORK YET TO BE DONE. WE'RE AT

00:19:44.850 --> 00:19:47.119
THE HALFWAY MARK AND SUCCESSFUL

00:19:47.185 --> 00:19:48.487
COMPLETION OF THE GRADUATION

00:19:48.554 --> 00:19:51.056
INITIATIVE WILL REQUIRE ONGOING

00:19:51.123 --> 00:19:53.425
PARTNERSHIP WITH THE STATE. IT

00:19:53.492 --> 00:19:54.359
WILL REQUIRE EVEN MORE

00:19:54.426 --> 00:19:57.095
INNOVATION ON OUR CAMPUSES AND

00:19:57.162 --> 00:19:58.664
THE KIND OF INSTITUTIONAL

00:19:58.730 --> 00:20:00.666
DEXTERITY DEMONSTRATED THIS

00:20:00.732 --> 00:20:02.701
PAST YEAR TO ENSURE THAT THE

00:20:02.768 --> 00:20:05.270
ISSUE STUDENTS CONTINUE. TO BE

00:20:05.337 --> 00:20:07.539

00:20:07.606 --> 00:20:10.776
HIGH QUALITY AFFORDABLE DEGREES.

00:20:10.842 --> 00:20:13.612
NOW I CAN TELL YOU THAT WHEN WE

00:20:13.679 --> 00:20:14.880
LAUNCH THE GRADUATION

00:20:14.947 --> 00:20:18.650
INITIATIVE- WE KNEW AT THE TIME

00:20:18.717 --> 00:20:21.353
THAT OUR PROGRESS BETWEEN

00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:23.522
TWENTY SIXTEEN AND TWENTY

00:20:23.589 --> 00:20:24.022
TWENTY FIVE WOULD NOT BE

00:20:24.089 --> 00:20:26.058
PERFECTLY LINEAR. HOWEVER I CAN

00:20:26.124 --> 00:20:27.693
ASSURE YOU THAT NO ONE WAS

00:20:27.759 --> 00:20:29.595
THINKING GLOBAL PANDEMIC IN THE

00:20:33.599 --> 00:20:36.501
MARK. I DO WANNA TAKE A MOMENT

00:20:36.568 --> 00:20:38.003
TO HIGHLIGHT JUST A FEW OF THE

00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:40.005
LARGE SCALE PROHIBITS THAT WE

00:28:19.497 --> 00:28:20.799
COMING YEAR BECAUSE REVENUES

00:28:20.865 --> 00:28:21.599
ARE COMING IN HIGHER THAN

00:28:21.666 --> 00:28:23.701
EXPECTED. OF COURSE THAT WOULD

00:28:23.768 --> 00:28:24.436
BE A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE

00:28:24.502 --> 00:28:26.771
SOME INVESTMENTS. IN THIS ISSUE

00:28:26.838 --> 00:28:30.341
AND GRADUATION INITIATIVE. BUT-

00:28:30.408 --> 00:28:32.410
IT HAS TO BE POINTED OUT THAT

00:28:32.477 --> 00:28:33.144
THE RECESSION HAS IMPACTED LOW

00:28:33.211 --> 00:28:35.313
INCOME. AND LOW SKILL WORKERS

00:28:35.380 --> 00:28:40.585
SO THE HARDEST- AND- THE BUT

00:28:40.652 --> 00:28:41.886
THE ECONOMY HAS NOT SUFFERED AS

00:28:41.953 --> 00:28:44.355
MUCH- PARTLY BECAUSE OF THE

00:28:44.422 --> 00:28:45.957
CREATIVE USE OF TECHNOLOGY LIKE

00:28:46.024 --> 00:28:48.059
WE'RE DOING RIGHT NOW- AND THE

00:28:48.126 --> 00:28:50.695
FACT THAT MANY OF OUR- HIGH

00:28:50.762 --> 00:28:53.498
PAYING. SKILLED JOBS. CONTINUE

00:28:53.565 --> 00:28:56.868
TO BE- HI CAN COULD DO TO BE

00:28:56.935 --> 00:28:57.302
PERFORMED- WITH THIS

00:28:57.368 --> 00:29:00.038
TECHNOLOGY. CLEARLY THE ECONOMY

00:29:00.105 --> 00:29:02.307
WILL BE TRANSFORMED. ADAM

00:29:02.373 --> 00:29:03.942
BECAUSE THIS THIS PANDEMIC HAS

00:29:04.008 --> 00:29:05.477
ACCELERATED A LOT OF CHANGES

00:29:05.543 --> 00:29:07.145
THAT WERE FORESEEABLE IN TERMS

00:29:07.212 --> 00:29:08.580
OF THE USE OF TECHNOLOGY IN NEW

00:29:08.646 --> 00:29:10.348
WAYS OF DOING THINGS. WHAT'S

00:29:10.415 --> 00:29:12.951
CLEAR- THAT WILL BE THE CASE IN

00:29:13.017 --> 00:29:15.053
THE POST FUND DEMING FUTURE. IS

00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:16.621
THAT- FLEXIBLE SKILLS AND

00:29:16.688 --> 00:29:18.189
TECHNOLOGICAL LITERACY WILL BE

00:29:18.256 --> 00:29:20.825
PARAMOUNT- IN THE FUTURE AND

00:29:20.892 --> 00:29:21.926
THAT A COLLEGE EDUCATION WILL

00:29:21.993 --> 00:29:25.330
BE. EVEN MORE CRITICAL- TO

00:29:25.396 --> 00:29:26.664
MAINTAIN THE CALIFORNIA

00:29:26.731 --> 00:29:29.000
ECONOMIES PRODUCTIVITY AND THE

00:29:29.067 --> 00:29:31.970
WELFARE OF OUR CITIZENS. SO I'M

00:29:32.036 --> 00:29:33.771
MAKE THOSE POINTS LET ME JUST-

00:29:33.838 --> 00:29:38.576
TURN NOW TO MY- POWERPOINT

00:29:38.643 --> 00:29:48.353
PRESENTATION HERE. SO I'M GONNA.

00:29:48.419 --> 00:29:49.954
TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW THE

00:29:50.021 --> 00:29:51.723
GRADUATION INITIATIVE HAS BEEN

00:29:51.789 --> 00:29:56.361
UNFOLDING AT OUR CAMPUS. IN A

00:29:56.427 --> 00:29:58.830
NUTSHELL THIS IS- THESE ARE THE

00:29:58.897 --> 00:30:00.965
RESULTS THE MOST CURRENT ONES-

00:30:01.032 --> 00:30:02.867
THE TARGETS SET OUT ON THE

00:30:02.934 --> 00:30:03.935
SECOND COLUMN AS YOU CAN SEE

00:30:04.002 --> 00:30:07.505
THERE FOR- FOR YOUR TRANSFER-

00:30:07.572 --> 00:30:10.441
AND- TO YOUR TRANSFER ETIENNE'S

00:30:10.508 --> 00:30:12.944
46% RESPECTIVELY. AND OUR

00:30:13.011 --> 00:30:15.914
CAMPUS HAS BEEN- REALLY

00:30:15.980 --> 00:30:18.516
SUCCESSFUL AND- MEETING THOSE

00:30:18.583 --> 00:30:20.552
OR EXCEEDING THEM ALREADY- EVEN

00:30:20.618 --> 00:30:23.454
FIVE YEARS AWAY FROM THE

00:30:23.521 --> 00:30:24.689
DEADLINE OF GI TWENTY TWENTY

00:30:24.756 --> 00:30:26.791
FIVE- IT DOES SEEM THAT

00:30:26.858 --> 00:30:28.760
GENERALLY SPEAKING- THIS ISSUE

00:30:28.826 --> 00:30:30.628
HAS BEEN- EXCEEDING

00:30:30.695 --> 00:30:32.564
EXPECTATIONS ON THE TRANSFER-

00:30:32.630 --> 00:30:35.667
TARGETS. OVERALL AND- THERE'S

00:30:35.733 --> 00:30:36.935
SOME REASONS FOR THAT THAT OLD

00:30:37.001 --> 00:30:39.938
LIEU TO LATER- ON THE- SIX

00:30:40.004 --> 00:30:42.907
YEAR- GRADUATION RATE FOR FIRST

00:30:42.974 --> 00:30:44.842
TIME FRESHMEN. WE'RE MAKING

00:30:44.909 --> 00:30:47.779
GOOD PROGRESS TOWARD OUR GOAL

00:30:47.845 --> 00:30:51.082
OF 63% AND THE FOUR YEAR- WERE

00:30:51.149 --> 00:30:53.585
A LITTLE BIT FARTHER AWAY- THE

00:30:53.651 --> 00:30:54.185
FOUR YEAR GRADUATION RATE BUT

00:30:54.252 --> 00:30:58.389
BUT ALSO- IT LOOKS- WE THAT WE

00:30:58.456 --> 00:30:59.257
ARE ON TRACK IF YOU ACTUALLY DO

00:30:59.324 --> 00:31:03.061
THE- QUALITY OF THESE- IT WE

00:31:03.127 --> 00:31:03.728
SHOULD BE ABLE TO MAKE IT BY

00:31:03.795 --> 00:31:06.197
TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. L. ADD AND

00:31:06.264 --> 00:31:07.599
THE UNDERREPRESENTED MINORITY

00:31:07.665 --> 00:31:10.568
EQUITY GAPS. ARE AN INTERESTING

00:31:10.635 --> 00:31:11.936
SITUATION THEY'RE NOT VERY

00:31:12.003 --> 00:31:16.975
LARGE- IT FLUCTUATED- OVER THE-

00:31:17.041 --> 00:31:18.576
FOUR YEARS WITH NO CLEAR TREND.

00:31:18.643 --> 00:31:20.712
ON AVERAGE THE PELLEGRI YEP

00:31:20.778 --> 00:31:22.847
IT'S BEEN ABOUT ONE PERCENT-

00:31:22.914 --> 00:31:24.182
WITH OUR GOAL IS OF COURSE TO

00:31:24.249 --> 00:31:25.950
ELIMINATED AND THEIR- UNDER

00:31:26.017 --> 00:31:27.018
REPRESENTED MINORITY EQUITY

00:31:27.085 --> 00:31:29.887
GAP. CURRENTLY STANDS AT- HALF

00:31:29.954 --> 00:31:32.123
A PERCENT. IN THE OPPOSITE

00:31:32.190 --> 00:31:33.491
DIRECTION SO RIGHT NOW ARE

00:31:33.558 --> 00:31:34.859
UNDERREPRESENTED MINORITY

00:31:34.926 --> 00:31:36.427
STUDENTS ARE PERFORMING

00:31:36.494 --> 00:31:38.763
SLIGHTLY BETTER THAN THE-

00:31:38.830 --> 00:31:40.932
POPULATION AT LARGE BUT OF

00:31:40.999 --> 00:31:42.000
COURSE THAT'S PROBABLY NOT

00:31:42.066 --> 00:31:44.202
STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT AS AS

00:31:44.269 --> 00:31:46.571
A VERY SMALL DIFFERENCE. ONE OF

00:31:46.638 --> 00:31:47.305
THE THINGS THAT WE OBSERVED IS

00:31:47.372 --> 00:31:51.676
THAT- SYSTEM BE USED TO HAVE-

00:31:51.743 --> 00:31:53.911
NO GAPS WHATSOEVER- WHEN WE

00:31:53.978 --> 00:31:55.847
STARTED IN THE DOWN THIS ROAD

00:31:55.913 --> 00:31:56.814
OF THE G. I.'S TWENTY TWENTY

00:31:56.881 --> 00:31:58.549
FIVE. THAT WAS A GOOD NEWS THAT

00:31:58.616 --> 00:31:59.651
THE BAD NEWS WAS THAT THE

00:31:59.717 --> 00:32:01.252
REASON WAS THAT THE VIRUS FROM

00:32:01.319 --> 00:32:03.554
RACE WERE NOT TERRIBLY GOOD FOR

00:32:03.621 --> 00:32:05.556
ANYBODY. AND SO AS WE'VE MADE

00:32:05.623 --> 00:32:08.926
GOOD PROGRESS- ON THESE-

00:32:08.993 --> 00:32:12.463
GRADUATION RATES- THE- THOSE

00:32:12.530 --> 00:32:13.698
RATES HAVE ALSO INCREASED-

00:32:13.765 --> 00:32:15.633
INCREASE FOR PL AND YOU ARE AND

00:32:15.700 --> 00:32:18.603
STUDENTS- BUT IN THE CASE OF

00:32:18.670 --> 00:32:21.239
FELT SON OF A GAP STARTED TO

00:32:21.306 --> 00:32:23.841
EMERGE- SO THAT THE IMPROVEMENT

00:32:23.908 --> 00:32:25.576
OVERALL WAS A LITTLE BIT LARGER

00:32:25.643 --> 00:32:27.011
THAN THE IMPROVEMENT WITHIN.

00:32:27.078 --> 00:32:28.846
THE PAL STUDENT POPULATION FOR

00:32:28.913 --> 00:32:30.848
THAT SO THEY THEY GAP STARTED

00:32:30.915 --> 00:32:32.550
TO EMERGE IS NOT VERY LARGE

00:32:32.617 --> 00:32:34.185
DOESN'T CLEAR TREND BUT IT IS

00:32:34.252 --> 00:32:36.020
THERE AND WHAT IS SUGGESTED TO

00:32:36.087 --> 00:32:37.588
US IS THAT WE MAY NEED TO-

00:32:37.655 --> 00:32:39.257
HAVING PICKED THE LOW HANGING

00:32:39.324 --> 00:32:40.758
FRUIT FOR THE POPULATION OF

00:32:40.825 --> 00:32:42.727
STUDENTS AT LARGE. WE MAY NEED

00:32:42.794 --> 00:32:49.367
SOME TARGETED- SO- CAL STUDENTS

00:32:49.434 --> 00:32:50.868
AND FOR UNDERREPRESENTED

00:32:50.935 --> 00:32:54.706
MINORITIES. HI THIS IS HOW WE

00:32:54.772 --> 00:32:56.007
ACHIEVE THESE RESULTS

00:32:56.074 --> 00:32:59.477
UNNATURAL- THE OVERSIGHT IS FOR

00:32:59.544 --> 00:33:02.413
ADVISING COMMANDERS

00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:04.082
MINIATURIZATION OUR- DEAL TURNS

00:33:04.148 --> 00:33:05.750
WE DEVELOPED TO REMEDIATION

00:33:05.817 --> 00:33:09.253
RESPONSE TO AN EXECUTIVE ORDER

00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:10.088
ELEVEN TEN- THE AUTO MODEL

00:33:10.154 --> 00:33:11.989
WHICH IS OUR- RESPONSE TO

00:33:12.056 --> 00:33:13.458
EXECUTIVE ORDER ELEVEN HUNDRED

00:33:13.524 --> 00:33:15.126
CALLING FOR A REVAMPING OF

ADMINISTRATIVE TWEAKS IN OUR

00:33:19.731 --> 00:33:23.468
PROCEDURES- RENEWED FOCUS ON

00:33:23.534 --> 00:33:24.702
TRANSFER STUDENTS ARE PAYING

00:33:24.769 --> 00:33:27.405
ATTENTION TO BASIC NEEDS AND-

00:33:27.472 --> 00:33:28.406
FOCUSING ON INCREASED STUDENT

00:33:28.473 --> 00:33:30.041
ENGAGEMENT THAT'S THE OVER HERE

00:33:30.108 --> 00:33:32.009
LET ME GO THROUGH THESE POINTS

00:33:32.076 --> 00:33:33.478
ON A LITTLE MORE DETAIL.

00:33:33.544 --> 00:33:35.213
ADVISING WHAT WE'VE DONE THERE

00:33:35.279 --> 00:33:37.148
IS WE HAVE CENTRALIZED- THE

00:33:37.215 --> 00:33:39.150
ADVISORS AND CONNECTED THEM TO

00:33:39.217 --> 00:33:41.319
THE CAREER SERVICES CENTER- AND

00:33:41.386 --> 00:33:42.720
REALLY MADE IT MORE OF A

00:33:42.787 --> 00:33:44.555
HOLISTIC APPROACH TO ADVISING

00:33:44.622 --> 00:33:45.790
STUDENTS SO THEY'RE CLEAR ON

00:33:45.857 --> 00:33:47.492
THEIR PATHWAYS. WE'VE ALSO

00:33:47.558 --> 00:33:49.093
INCREASE THE OVERALL NUMBER OF

00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:51.929
ADVISORS. THERE IS AN EARLY

00:33:51.996 --> 00:33:53.798
ALERT TEAM AND THAT- DOES

00:33:53.865 --> 00:33:55.566
OUTREACH TO AT RISK STUDENTS

00:33:55.633 --> 00:33:56.968
THEN THAT'S A MULTI

00:33:57.034 --> 00:33:58.302
DISCIPLINARY TEAM OF FACULTY

00:33:58.369 --> 00:34:01.139

SPOT- YOU KNOW EMERGING

00:34:05.977 --> 00:34:09.781
PROBLEMS WITH STUDENTS AND- AND

00:34:09.847 --> 00:34:11.616
INTERVENE. I WE- APPROACH A

00:34:11.682 --> 00:34:13.384

ASIAN AND THAT HAS REALLY LED

00:34:25.430 --> 00:34:28.032
TO- IMPROVE STUDENT OUTCOMES-

00:34:28.099 --> 00:34:30.201
THE OVERALL ENROLLMENT RATE HAS

00:34:30.268 --> 00:34:34.138
INCREASED- FOR STUDENTS AS WELL

AS FOR- UNDERSERVED

00:34:36.007 --> 00:34:39.744
POPULATIONS- THE STUDENTS WHO

00:34:39.811 --> 00:34:41.546
DO ATTEND MANAGER EDITION ARE

00:34:41.612 --> 00:34:43.314
SHOWING HIGHER PARTICIPATION IN

ACADEMIC STANDING SO THESE ARE

00:34:55.493 --> 00:34:58.396
ALL MEASURABLE OUTCOMES- THAT

00:34:58.463 --> 00:35:01.466
SHOW IMPROVEMENT AS A RESULT

00:35:01.532 --> 00:35:05.203
THIS MANCHURIAN TATIAN-

EXECUTIVE ORDER ELEVEN TEN- THE

00:35:07.939 --> 00:35:09.173
WAY WE RESPONDED TO THAT OUR

00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:10.908
CAMPUSES WE DEVELOPED A

00:35:10.975 --> 00:35:13.010
STRAIGHT STRETCH CORE STRATEGY

00:35:13.077 --> 00:35:16.514

DOCTOR GRAPH- EVEN BEFORE YOUR

00:35:25.857 --> 00:35:26.390
ELEVEN HUNDRED ELEVEN TEN CAME

00:35:26.457 --> 00:35:29.627
INTO PLAY BUT ONCE IT DID WE-

00:35:29.694 --> 00:35:32.530
EXTENDED- THE COVERAGE OF THAT

00:35:32.597 --> 00:35:34.031
COURSE TO STUDENTS THAT WOULD

00:35:34.098 --> 00:35:36.667
HAVE OTHERWISE. A TAKEN A

REMEDIAL OR DEVELOPMENTAL

00:35:37.268 --> 00:35:39.804
COURSES AND THE OUTCOMES HAVE

00:35:39.871 --> 00:35:41.906
BEEN REALLY QUITE POSITIVE-

00:35:41.973 --> 00:35:43.774
WHEN INITIALLY IS- INTRODUCED

THIRTEEN POINT THREE OF SIX

00:35:51.749 --> 00:35:54.185
POINT SEVEN AND AFTER WE

00:35:54.252 --> 00:35:55.887
EXPANDED THE COVERAGEOF THIS

POINT 7% FOR THE STUDENTS THAT

00:36:07.532 --> 00:36:08.466

NORMALLY TAKEN DRAMA COURSES

00:36:10.001 --> 00:36:13.804
WERE JUST AS SUCCESSFUL- WITH

AND THAT THIS IS NOT UNUSUAL IN

00:39:03.374 --> 00:39:05.076
THIS ISSUE AND I THINK. A LOT

00:39:05.142 --> 00:39:06.744
OF IT HAS TO DO WITH SOME OF

00:39:06.811 --> 00:39:07.712

YOUR CAMPUS BY STAFF HAS SENT

THEIR CAMPUSES LOCALLY WHAT

01:03:22.965 --> 01:03:25.501
WHAT WE SEE SENATOR IS IN DC

01:03:25.568 --> 01:03:27.904
YES THERE ARE SOME ISSUES WITH

01:03:27.970 --> 01:03:30.973
ACCESSIBILITY. AND OUR ABILITY

01:03:31.040 --> 01:03:32.775
TO CHEAP STUDENTS CONNECTED TO

01:03:32.842 --> 01:03:35.011
OUR CAMPUSES I WILL SAY FROM

01:03:35.077 --> 01:03:36.879
THE SYSTEM OFFERS THAT VARIES

01:03:36.946 --> 01:03:39.182
QUITE SUBSTANTIALLY ACROSS THE

01:03:39.248 --> 01:03:41.684
SYSTEM. WELL AS YOU CAN IMAGINE

01:03:41.751 --> 01:03:44.554
A MORE URBAN AREAS- THE ACCESS

01:03:44.620 --> 01:03:47.623
TO BROADBAND IS A LOT MORE THAN

01:03:47.690 --> 01:03:49.625
IDEAS ABOUT SOME MORE WAR AREAS

01:03:49.692 --> 01:03:51.727
OF THE STATE. AND SOLVED-

01:03:51.794 --> 01:03:53.930
STRATEGIES AT OUR CAMPUSES OF

01:03:53.996 --> 01:03:56.432
HATS- OUTLINED TO KEEP STUDENTS

01:03:56.499 --> 01:03:58.201
CONNECTED TO THE CAMPUSES OF

01:03:58.267 --> 01:04:00.503
ALSO VARY QUITE SIGNIFICANTLY

01:04:00.570 --> 01:04:01.470
BUT I'LL TELL YOU WHAT THE

01:04:01.537 --> 01:04:03.606
CHALLENGES NOT ONLY BROADBAND

01:04:03.673 --> 01:04:05.274
ACCESS IT'S ALSO THE

01:04:05.341 --> 01:04:07.143
AVAILABILITY OF DEVICES TO

01:04:07.210 --> 01:04:08.978
CONNECT SO THAT BROADBAND WHERE

01:04:09.045 --> 01:04:11.514
IT EXISTS. AND ONE EXTENSION OF

01:04:11.581 --> 01:04:14.884
THAT IS ALSO- APPROPRIATE

01:04:14.951 --> 01:04:16.852
LEARNING SPACE THAT STUDENTS

01:04:16.919 --> 01:04:20.623
HAVE WHEN CONNECTED. TO REALLY

01:04:20.690 --> 01:04:21.757
BE ABLE TO FOCUS AND

01:04:21.824 --> 01:04:23.192
CONCENTRATE ON THEIR STUDIES

01:04:23.259 --> 01:04:25.595
SALT IT IS ACCESS TO BROADBAND

01:04:25.661 --> 01:04:27.697
IT IS THE TECHNOLOGY TO CONNECT

01:04:27.763 --> 01:04:30.399
WHERE IT EXISTS AND IT'S ALSO-

01:04:30.466 --> 01:04:31.567
ENSURING THAT THEY HAVE

01:04:31.634 --> 01:04:34.837
ADEQUATE SPACE TO ACTUALLY-

01:04:34.904 --> 01:04:36.205
FOCUS ON THEIR STUDIES AND

01:04:36.272 --> 01:04:40.509
WAVES. THAT KEEP THEM MOVING

01:04:40.576 --> 01:04:41.711
TOWARDS THEIR DEGREE. OR WE-

01:04:41.777 --> 01:04:43.279
THEN ARE WE WORKING ON THE- A-

01:04:43.346 --> 01:04:45.481
THE GENERAL. I REALIZED SOME OF

01:04:45.548 --> 01:04:46.682
THIS IS CAMPUS AND REGION

01:04:46.749 --> 01:04:49.885
SPECIFIC BUT A GENERAL PLAN TO

01:04:49.952 --> 01:04:51.988
DEAL WITH THE BROADBAND ACCESS

01:04:52.054 --> 01:04:53.856
ISSUES IN THE DEVICE ISSUES.

01:04:53.923 --> 01:04:55.725
THAT WOULD TIE IN TO WHAT THE

01:04:55.791 --> 01:04:58.694
LEGISLATURE EITHER HAS DONE

01:04:58.761 --> 01:05:00.963
WILL DO OR NEEDS TO. PROVIDE

01:05:01.030 --> 01:05:04.000
SUPPORT AND MONEY TO TRY TO

01:05:04.066 --> 01:05:05.801
BRIDGE THIS GAP. WE'RE WORKING

01:05:05.868 --> 01:05:07.236
THESE ISSUES AND ON THE K.

01:05:07.303 --> 01:05:08.804
THROUGH TWELVE ENVIRONMENT. I'M

01:05:08.871 --> 01:05:10.172
INTERESTED IN MAKING SURE THAT

01:05:10.239 --> 01:05:12.108
WE WORK THE ISSUES. IN THE C.

01:05:12.174 --> 01:05:13.976
ISSUE ANTIC TO THE EXTENT IT

01:05:14.043 --> 01:05:15.411
EXISTS THE UC ENVIRONMENT AS

01:05:15.478 --> 01:05:16.812
WELL BUT WE NEED TO WHAT KNOW

01:05:16.879 --> 01:05:18.247
WHAT THE PROBLEMS ARE WE NEED

01:05:18.314 --> 01:05:22.318
THE SYSTEM TO. HELP US THE A

01:05:22.385 --> 01:05:22.918
DESIGN A STRATEGY TO DEAL WITH

01:05:22.985 --> 01:05:24.887
IT. THANK YOU SENATOR WOULD BE

HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU ON THAT.

01:05:29.659 --> 01:05:31.861
I ALSO ALSO WOULD BE INTERESTED

01:05:31.927 --> 01:05:34.263
ABOUT THE- NEED TO PROVIDE

HEALTH- PLAYS A SIGNIFICANT

01:05:43.506 --> 01:05:46.609
FACTOR IN GRADUATION SUCCESS.

01:05:46.676 --> 01:05:51.147
AND IF SO- WHAT MENTAL HEALTH

01:05:51.213 --> 01:05:53.115

01:06:18.941 --> 01:06:19.742
THAT YOU ASK BOTH OF THOSE

01:06:19.809 --> 01:06:21.377
QUESTIONS BECAUSE AS IT TURNS

01:06:21.444 --> 01:06:23.312
OUT I HAVE MEANT TO ADDRESS

01:06:23.379 --> 01:06:27.817
THEM AND- I FORGOT I HAD THIS.

01:06:27.883 --> 01:06:29.652
ONE LESS LIGHT HERE SO I'LL USE

01:06:29.719 --> 01:06:33.889
THAT TO- STRUCTURE MY RESPONSE-

01:06:33.956 --> 01:06:37.827
THE STUDENTS HAVE BEEN- HAVING

01:06:37.893 --> 01:06:39.462
DIFFICULTY STAYING ENGAGED AND

01:06:39.528 --> 01:06:40.663
THIS IS ONE OF THE CHALLENGES

01:06:40.730 --> 01:06:42.231
THAT WE'RE FACING IN THE

01:06:42.298 --> 01:06:44.667
VIRTUAL MODALITY- WE'RE ALSO

01:06:44.734 --> 01:06:46.902
BECOMING AWARE OF THE HOME AND

01:06:46.969 --> 01:06:48.003
FAMILY PRESSURES THAT STUDENTS

01:06:48.070 --> 01:06:50.172
AND EVEN FACULTY HAVE FACULTY

01:06:50.239 --> 01:06:52.007
WITH ISSUES WITH CHILD CARE AND

01:06:52.074 --> 01:06:54.577
SO FORTH AND FINING QUIET TIME.

01:06:54.643 --> 01:06:56.512
AND FOR MANY OF OUR STUDENTS

01:06:56.579 --> 01:06:57.513
PARTICULARLY OUR LOW INCOME

01:06:57.580 --> 01:06:59.615
STUDENTS IN THE SALINAS VALLEY

01:06:59.682 --> 01:07:02.651
AND OTHER AREAS- THEY HAVE-

01:07:02.718 --> 01:07:04.019
THEY DON'T HAVE QUITE SPACE AT

01:07:04.086 --> 01:07:06.155
HOME THEY HAVE A PRESSURES ON

01:07:06.222 --> 01:07:07.690
THEIR TIME THEY NEED THEIR THE-

01:07:07.757 --> 01:07:09.358
THE- THERE ARE FAMILY MEMBERS

01:07:09.425 --> 01:07:10.960
DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND WHY THEY

01:07:11.026 --> 01:07:12.461
CAN'T THEY'RE NOT AVAILABLE TO

01:07:12.528 --> 01:07:14.597
THEM SO THEY ARE PHYSICALLY- IT

01:07:14.663 --> 01:07:15.931
MAKES IT QUITE DIFFICULT AND

01:07:15.998 --> 01:07:17.266
THEN THE BROADBAND AND THE

01:07:17.333 --> 01:07:19.268
ACCESS TO LAPTOPS IS ARE ALSO

01:07:19.335 --> 01:07:21.604
ISSUES. WE HAVE RESPONDED BY

01:07:21.670 --> 01:07:24.807
ISSUING- HUNDREDS IF NOT

01:07:24.874 --> 01:07:27.176
THOUSANDS OF- HOT SPOTS- AND

01:07:27.243 --> 01:07:29.445
LAPTOPS TO STUDENTS THAT NEED

01:07:29.512 --> 01:07:32.214
THEM- BUT THERE IS A PROBLEM

01:07:32.281 --> 01:07:34.049
WITH BROADBAND IF YOU IF YOU

01:07:34.116 --> 01:07:35.785
GIVE HOTSPOTS TO STUDENTS THEIR

01:07:35.851 --> 01:07:37.319
PARTS SOME PARTS OF OUR COUNTY

01:07:37.386 --> 01:07:38.854
WHERE YOU DON'T YOU DON'T HAVE

01:07:38.921 --> 01:07:39.989
THE YOU KNOW THE HOSPITAL'S

01:07:40.055 --> 01:07:43.058
WORK SO- WE ARE MAY WERE

01:07:43.125 --> 01:07:44.427
COLLABORATING WITH THE-

01:07:44.493 --> 01:07:46.028
MONTEREY COUNTY- OFFICER

01:07:46.095 --> 01:07:48.998
DUCATION- AS WELL AS WITH SOME

01:07:49.064 --> 01:07:50.800
AYE REGIONAL. ECONOMIC

01:07:50.866 --> 01:07:52.735
DEVELOPMENT- GROUPS AND THE

01:07:52.802 --> 01:07:54.904
COUNTY ITSELF TRYING TO DEVELOP

01:07:54.970 --> 01:07:57.540
A- A COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY

01:07:57.606 --> 01:08:00.075
FRANKLY I WOULD SUGGEST THAT

01:08:00.142 --> 01:08:03.045
CALIFORNIA- WOULD BENEFIT IN

01:08:03.112 --> 01:08:06.649
MULTIPLE WAYS BY DEVELOPING-

01:08:06.715 --> 01:08:08.717
UNIVERSAL BROADBAND ADVOCATE

01:08:08.784 --> 01:08:10.786
ACCESS ACROSS THE STATE SOME

01:08:10.853 --> 01:08:12.221
THIS IS COMPARABLE TO WHAT SOME

01:08:12.288 --> 01:08:15.724
AYE ASIAN- COUNTRIES- ARE DOING

01:08:15.791 --> 01:08:17.092
BECAUSE I THINK IT WOULD HAVE A

01:08:17.159 --> 01:08:18.594
NOT ONLY A TREMENDOUS IMPACT ON

01:08:18.661 --> 01:08:20.563
OUR EDUCATIONAL EFFECTIVENESS

01:08:20.629 --> 01:08:22.364
BUT ALSO IN TERMS OF OUR

01:08:22.431 --> 01:08:24.033
ECONOMY- IN TERMS OF THE

01:08:24.099 --> 01:08:30.039
ABILITY TO DRAW IN PEOPLE. INTO

01:08:30.105 --> 01:08:30.973
THE- INTERNET ECONOMY ACROSS

01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:32.208
THE STATE- IT WOULD BE I THINK

01:08:32.274 --> 01:08:34.910
A- I'M- TRANSFORMATIONAL IN FOR.

01:08:34.977 --> 01:08:38.747
PROJECT WELL THE LAST THING I

01:08:38.814 --> 01:08:40.082
HAD HERE THAT THAT YOU DIDN'T

01:08:40.149 --> 01:08:41.884
MENTION THAT IS- IN TERMS OF

01:08:41.951 --> 01:08:43.352
WHAT IMPACT THIS IS HAVING ON

01:08:43.419 --> 01:08:46.021
OUR CAMPUSES. OF PHYSICAL EVEN

01:08:46.088 --> 01:08:48.491
THOUGH WE HAVE MAINTAIN A ROMAN

01:08:48.557 --> 01:08:49.725
WE DON'T HAVE STUDENTS ON

01:08:49.792 --> 01:08:51.794
CAMPUS AND SO ARE OF SIMILAR

01:08:51.861 --> 01:08:53.262
ORGANIZATIONS THAT PROVIDE

01:08:53.329 --> 01:08:54.663
HOUSING AND DINING HAVE BEEN

01:08:54.730 --> 01:08:57.166
SEVERELY IMPACTED FINANCIALLY

01:08:57.233 --> 01:08:57.766
AND WE'RE- HAVING TO HELP THEM

01:08:57.833 --> 01:08:59.802
OUT. BUT WE'RE GONNA HAPPEN YOU

01:08:59.869 --> 01:09:00.436
KNOW I DON'T KNOW WHETHER I'LL

01:09:00.503 --> 01:09:02.037
BE HANDLING IT. IS NEXT YEAR

01:09:02.104 --> 01:09:03.272
BUT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DEAL

01:09:03.339 --> 01:09:05.741
WITH THAT LAST ISSUE. BECAUSE

01:09:05.808 --> 01:09:07.843
YOU KNOW UNFORTUNATELY DUE TO

01:09:07.910 --> 01:09:09.612
THIS CALL BUT NINETEEN. YOU

01:09:09.678 --> 01:09:11.347
HAVE A LOT OF SUNK COST AND

01:09:11.413 --> 01:09:13.816
OBLIGATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH-

01:09:13.883 --> 01:09:15.885
WITH- HOUSING FACILITIES AND

01:09:15.951 --> 01:09:18.020
DINING FACILITIES- THAT THE

01:09:18.087 --> 01:09:19.822
STATE DOESN'T PAY TO BUILD AND

01:09:19.889 --> 01:09:21.290
THOSE OBLIGATIONS HAVE TO BE

01:09:21.357 --> 01:09:23.826
SERVICE SO WE'RE GOING TO HAVE

01:09:23.893 --> 01:09:25.160
TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO. OTHER

01:09:25.227 --> 01:09:27.096
COVER THAT GAP FOR YOU SOME WAY

01:09:27.162 --> 01:09:29.031
CONSISTENT WITH THE WAY WE DO

01:09:29.098 --> 01:09:29.632
OUR BUDGETING IN THE WAY WE

01:09:29.698 --> 01:09:31.634
ROLL OUT THE MONEY. AND WITH

01:09:31.700 --> 01:09:32.568
RESPECT TO THE BROADBAND

01:09:32.635 --> 01:09:35.104
FRANKLY- I WANT TO GET THE

01:09:35.170 --> 01:09:35.738
MENTAL HEALTH IN A MINUTE BUT

01:09:35.804 --> 01:09:37.206
WITH. RESPECT TO THE BROADBAND

01:09:37.273 --> 01:09:39.708
I THINK THIS IS ONE ISSUE WHERE

01:09:39.775 --> 01:09:41.410
HIGHER EDUCATION CAN JOIN WITH-

01:09:41.477 --> 01:09:42.978
THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES SO THAT

01:09:43.045 --> 01:09:44.446
PIECE OF HIGHER ED AND K.

01:09:44.513 --> 01:09:47.116
THROUGH TWELVE- SYSTEMS BECAUSE

01:09:47.182 --> 01:09:49.084
THE ISSUES ARE THE SAME. OF THE

01:09:49.151 --> 01:09:50.286
SOLUTIONS MAYBE A LITTLE BIT

01:09:50.352 --> 01:09:51.587
DIFFERENT IN THE WAY THEY'RE

01:09:51.654 --> 01:09:52.521
FUNDED MAY BE A LITTLE BIT

01:09:52.588 --> 01:09:54.223
DIFFERENT. BUT THE ISSUES OF

01:09:54.290 --> 01:09:55.491
THE SAME AND WIENER WE'RE GONNA

01:09:55.558 --> 01:09:58.227
NEED TO TACKLE THESE. BECAUSE

01:09:58.294 --> 01:09:59.461
FRANKLY I'M NOT SURE WE KNOW

01:09:59.528 --> 01:10:01.730
WHAT THE FUTURE. OF ON SITE

01:10:01.797 --> 01:10:03.365
EDUCATION REALLY LOOKS LIKE.

01:10:03.432 --> 01:10:06.535
AND THAT ALSO INVOLVES PERHAPS

01:10:06.602 --> 01:10:09.505
PERHAPS- CONCEPT OF LEARNING

01:10:09.572 --> 01:10:11.006
CENTERS COUPLED WITH CHILD CARE

01:10:11.073 --> 01:10:13.275
IN A COLD ENVIRONMENT BETTER-

01:10:13.342 --> 01:10:15.110
THE CONSTRUCTOR TO AND OPERATED

01:10:15.177 --> 01:10:16.245
IN ACCORDANCE WITH CDC

01:10:16.312 --> 01:10:18.047
GUIDELINES BUT IN TERMS OF

01:10:18.113 --> 01:10:19.982
PROVIDING A QUIET SPACE FOR

01:10:20.049 --> 01:10:21.684
LEARNING A WHILE YOUR FAMILY

01:10:21.750 --> 01:10:22.952
MEMBERS ARE TAKING CARE OF

01:10:23.018 --> 01:10:24.119
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO RETHINK

01:10:24.186 --> 01:10:26.088
THAT TO AND FIGURE OUT HOW TO.

01:10:26.155 --> 01:10:30.392
HOW TO PROPERLY FUND- THE- THE

01:10:30.459 --> 01:10:32.494
IMPLEMENTATION OF THAT AND

01:10:32.561 --> 01:10:34.063
DOING IT IN A WAY THAT COMPLIES

01:10:34.129 --> 01:10:35.998
AS I SAID WITH. WITH THE COVERT

01:10:36.065 --> 01:10:37.766
ROLES IN THE CDC GUIDELINES I

01:10:37.833 --> 01:10:40.035
THINK THAT'S CRITICAL AND I DO

01:10:40.102 --> 01:10:41.971
WANT TO FURTHER EXPLORE NOT

01:10:42.037 --> 01:10:43.706
PERHAPS IN THIS IN THIS SETTING

01:10:43.772 --> 01:10:45.140
THEY WANT TO HIJACK MY CHURCH

01:10:45.207 --> 01:10:46.675
HEARING BUT IF YOU WANT TO

01:10:46.742 --> 01:10:48.043
EXPLORE MENTAL HEALTH BECAUSE

01:10:48.110 --> 01:10:49.612
I'M NOT SURE THAT WE REALLY

01:10:49.678 --> 01:10:51.780
CRACKED THE NUT ON THAT. HOW WE

01:10:51.847 --> 01:10:54.216
HOW WE FUNDED ON YOUR CAMPUSES-

01:10:54.283 --> 01:10:55.651
IN EARLIER HEARINGS PEOPLE

01:13:14.156 --> 01:13:16.125
GRADUATION RATES. THAT WE KNOW

01:13:16.191 --> 01:13:18.060
HOW CONNECTED THAT IS. I LIKE

01:13:18.127 --> 01:13:20.028
TO BRING BACK THE DOCTOR MINOR

01:13:20.095 --> 01:13:21.764

TESTIMONY AND YOUR LEADERSHIP

01:13:23.499 --> 01:13:24.967
IN THE SYSTEM. IT'S A

01:13:25.033 --> 01:13:26.969
CHALLENGING PLACE BECAUSE YOU

01:13:27.035 --> 01:13:28.637
KNOW YU'RE NOT RUNNING THINGS

01:13:28.704 --> 01:13:30.439
HERE GUIDING THE TWENTY THREE

01:13:30.506 --> 01:13:32.541
CAMPUSES AND I. APPRECIATE THE

01:13:32.608 --> 01:13:34.610
CHALLENGES THAT COME INTO PLAY-

01:13:34.676 --> 01:13:37.479
IN THAT REGARD- BUT WE HAVE

01:13:37.546 --> 01:13:39.748
THAT SCENE- IN DOUBT THAT THE

01:13:39.815 --> 01:13:42.117
DATA THAT YOU HAVE PROVIDED-

01:13:42.184 --> 01:13:44.720
AND HEARD ABOUT TODAY THAT. WE

01:13:44.787 --> 01:13:45.921
ARE WE HAVE CAMPUSES THAT HAVE

01:13:45.988 --> 01:13:48.991
ROBUST ENGAGEMENTS AT AND IS

01:13:49.057 --> 01:13:50.659
FOR YOUR PATHWAY- AS I

01:13:50.726 --> 01:13:52.327
MENTIONED SACRAMENTO STATE SAN

JOSE STATE LONG BEACH. THEY ARE

01:13:54.396 --> 01:13:56.331
VERY ROBUST PARTICIPATION IN

01:13:56.398 --> 01:13:57.399
THE FOUR YEAR PROGRAM OVER TWO

01:13:57.466 --> 01:13:59.234
THOUSAND. STUDENTS IN MANY OF

01:13:59.301 --> 01:14:00.569
THE CAMPUSES BUT ON SOME OF THE

01:14:00.636 --> 01:14:01.703
OTHERS AND I'M I'M GLAD TO HEAR

01:14:01.770 --> 01:14:03.205
IT CAL STATE LA THEY'RE

01:14:03.272 --> 01:14:03.872
BEGINNING THE PROGRAM THIS

01:14:03.939 --> 01:14:06.975
YEAR. THERE REALLY HASN'T BEEN-

01:14:07.042 --> 01:14:09.978
THESE PROGRAM- OFFERED. AND IT

01:14:10.045 --> 01:14:11.413
DOESN'T MEAN THAT THERE AREN'T

01:14:11.480 --> 01:14:13.015
GREAT ACTIVITIES THAT THE

01:14:13.081 --> 01:14:14.583
SYSTEM AT THE CAMPUSES ARE

01:14:14.650 --> 01:14:18.086
DOING TO. ENCOURAGE STUDENTS TO

01:14:18.153 --> 01:14:18.887
TAKE FULL COURSE LOADS IN THE

01:14:18.954 --> 01:14:21.123
REST. CERTAINLY THOSE HAVE BEEN

01:14:21.190 --> 01:14:22.057
IMPRESSIVE AND YOU'VE

01:14:22.124 --> 01:14:23.759
IDENTIFIED A NUMBER OF THEM IN

01:14:23.826 --> 01:14:28.230
YOUR TESTIMONY AS AS. WE'VE

01:14:28.297 --> 01:14:28.797
HEARD FROM SOME OF THE OTHER

01:14:28.864 --> 01:14:29.865
CAMPUSES. BOB BUT AGAIN I GO

01:14:29.932 --> 01:14:31.300
BACK TO THE POINT THAT IF

01:14:31.366 --> 01:14:32.601
STUDENTS KNOW ABOUT THE FOR

01:14:32.668 --> 01:14:33.769
YOUR PATH THEY KNOW THEY CAN

01:14:33.836 --> 01:14:34.937
GET ON IT THEY WANT TO GET ON

01:14:35.003 --> 01:14:37.072
IT BUT THEY HAVE TO KNOW. THAT

01:14:37.139 --> 01:14:38.607
IT'S THERE CAN YOU TALK TO ME

01:14:38.674 --> 01:14:40.075
ABOUT HOW YOU ARE WORKING WITH

01:14:40.142 --> 01:14:42.511
THE CAMPUS IS THAT- DON'T HAVE

01:14:42.578 --> 01:14:44.346
PROGRAMS AT ALL OR HAVE VERY

01:14:44.413 --> 01:14:45.814
SMALL PARTICIPATION TO GET THEM

01:14:45.881 --> 01:14:49.585
TO DO MORE TO. PUBLICIZE IT AND

01:14:49.651 --> 01:14:54.656
TO MAKE THAT OFFERING AVAILABLE.

01:14:54.723 --> 01:14:55.924
THANK YOU SENATOR I THINK IT'S

01:14:55.991 --> 01:14:59.061
A VERY. GOOD OBSERVATION ABOUT

01:14:59.127 --> 01:15:00.629
IN TERMS OF THE VARIANCES

01:15:00.696 --> 01:15:03.599
ACROSS CAMPUSES. I DO JUST WANT

01:15:03.665 --> 01:15:04.800
TO MENTION WITH THE

01:15:04.867 --> 01:15:07.236
PARTICIPATION AND OUR- PROMISE

01:15:07.302 --> 01:15:09.705
PROGRAM. CALIFORNIA PROMISE

01:15:09.771 --> 01:15:13.242
PROGRAM- THE WAYS IN WHICH

01:15:13.308 --> 01:15:15.444
WE'RE FEATURING THE PROGRAM ARE

01:15:15.510 --> 01:15:16.945
EVOLVING AND I THINK THE LAST

01:15:17.012 --> 01:15:18.814
TIME. I WAS BEFORE THIS

01:15:18.881 --> 01:15:20.549
COMMITTEE WE MENTIONED NOW THAT

01:15:20.616 --> 01:15:22.584
EVERY SINGLE STUDENT THAT

01:15:22.651 --> 01:15:25.287
APPLIES TO THE C. ISSUE- HAS AN

01:15:25.354 --> 01:15:27.756
OPTION THE EXPRESS THEIR

01:15:27.823 --> 01:15:29.758
INTEREST IN THIS PROGRAM AND

01:15:29.825 --> 01:15:31.660
THAT'S THE ISSUE APPLY PORTAL

01:15:31.727 --> 01:15:33.061
WHICH IS WHERE EVERY STUDENT

01:15:33.128 --> 01:15:35.397
APPLIES TO THE CSU. SO THAT IS

01:15:35.464 --> 01:15:37.099
LED TO US BEING ABLE TO

01:15:37.165 --> 01:15:39.134
IDENTIFY STUDENTS WHO ARE

01:15:39.201 --> 01:15:40.869
INTERESTED IN THE PROGRAM.

01:15:40.936 --> 01:15:41.870
THERE ARE A COUPLE OF OTHER

01:15:41.937 --> 01:15:43.205
COMPONENTS OF THIS THAT I JUST

01:15:43.272 --> 01:15:44.706
WANT TO BE CAREFUL AND CLEAR

01:15:44.773 --> 01:15:48.243
ABOUT THE OTHER HAS TO DO WITH

01:15:48.310 --> 01:15:51.346
THE SHIFT ON OUR CAMPUSES- TO

01:15:51.413 --> 01:15:53.348
BE ABLE TO PROVIDE STUDENTS NOT

01:15:53.415 --> 01:15:55.984
ONLY A FULL COURSE LOAD OR

01:15:56.051 --> 01:15:57.586
FIFTEEN UNITS BUT IT'S THE

01:15:57.653 --> 01:15:59.888
RIGHT FIFTEEN UNITS THAT ARE

01:15:59.955 --> 01:16:01.023
ASSOCIATED WITH THEIR

01:16:01.089 --> 01:16:03.025
PARTICULAR DEGREE PROGRAM SO I

01:16:03.091 --> 01:16:04.793
THINK WHAT YOU'RE ALSO SEEING.

01:16:04.860 --> 01:16:08.196
OUR CAMPUSES DO OVER TIME IS TO

01:16:08.263 --> 01:16:09.498
BE ABLE TO MAXIMIZE THE

01:16:09.564 --> 01:16:12.067
EFFICIENCY OF THE AVAILABLE

01:16:12.134 --> 01:16:13.835
COURSES ON THEIR CAMPUSES A

01:16:13.902 --> 01:16:15.704
LINE THOSE COURSES WITH DEGREE

01:16:15.771 --> 01:16:17.940
PROGRAMS AND I'LL GIVE YOU ONE

01:16:18.006 --> 01:16:18.573
EXAMPLE I WAS SPEAKING WITH THE

01:16:18.640 --> 01:16:23.111
STUDENT- LAST TERM- THE

01:16:23.178 --> 01:16:24.947
INTERESTED IN TAKING. UNITS IN

01:16:25.013 --> 01:16:27.115
TO TAKE A LOOK HER. HOWEVER THE

01:16:27.182 --> 01:16:28.817
FIFTY UNITS WORKS. WITH HER

01:16:28.884 --> 01:16:31.486
DEGREE PROGRAM TAKE THIS COURSE

01:16:31.553 --> 01:16:33.388
NOT BACKWARDS. ONE IN.

01:16:33.455 --> 01:16:37.192
AVAILABLE ENACT HER. AND SO SHE

01:16:37.259 --> 01:16:38.760
COULD HAVE TAKEN A FULL LOCAL

01:16:38.827 --> 01:16:40.028
BUT SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN TAKING

01:16:40.095 --> 01:16:41.830
COURSES THAT WERE NOT ALIGNED

01:16:41.897 --> 01:16:43.632
WITH HER DEGREE PROGRAMS SO

01:16:43.699 --> 01:16:47.602
SOME OF IT IS A BILE- REALIZING

01:16:47.669 --> 01:16:48.737
GREATER EFFICIENCY AND

01:16:48.804 --> 01:16:49.571
ALIGNMENT AND OF COURSE

01:16:49.638 --> 01:16:51.306
SCHEDULE. AND THEN THE THIRD

01:16:51.373 --> 01:16:52.841
COMPONENT OF THIS I THINK IS

01:16:52.908 --> 01:16:54.409
ALSO VERY IMPORTANT IS JUST

01:16:54.476 --> 01:16:56.645
YOUR CAPACITY. AND SO YOU'RE

01:16:56.712 --> 01:16:58.647
SEEING SOME OF OUR CAMPUSES

01:16:58.714 --> 01:17:02.584
MADE VERY VERY- ARCHES BUT ALSO

01:17:02.651 --> 01:17:04.286
DIFFICULT DECISIONS ABOUT

01:17:04.353 --> 01:17:06.755
INVESTING IN- COURSE SCHEDULE

01:17:06.822 --> 01:17:09.291
IN THE CAPACITY ON THEIR CAMPUS

01:17:09.358 --> 01:17:10.559
TO DELIVER THOSE COURSES NOT

01:17:10.625 --> 01:17:12.394
ONLY FOR STUDENTS WHO. HAVE

01:17:12.461 --> 01:17:14.129
INDICATED INTEREST IN- PROMISE

01:17:14.196 --> 01:17:16.865
PROGRAM BUT FOR ALL STUDENTS

01:17:16.932 --> 01:17:18.834
ACROSS THE CAMPUS AND SO MY

01:17:18.900 --> 01:17:20.836
EXPECTATION SENATORS THAT WE

01:17:20.902 --> 01:17:22.904
WILL CONTINUE TO SEE AN UPTICK

01:17:22.971 --> 01:17:24.439
BOTH IN THE PARTICIPATION IN

01:17:24.506 --> 01:17:26.908
THE PROGRAM. AND THE NUMBER OF

01:17:26.975 --> 01:17:28.243
STUDENTS WERE TAKEN UP FOR

01:17:28.310 --> 01:17:30.812
COURSE LOW AND I THINK THE

01:17:30.879 --> 01:17:33.181
PROMISING INDICATION FOR US IS

01:17:33.248 --> 01:17:35.417
WHAT WE'RE SEEING. AMONG OUR

01:17:35.484 --> 01:17:36.918
FIRST YEAR STUDENTS AND BOTH

01:17:36.985 --> 01:17:38.954
SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN THAT

01:17:39.021 --> 01:17:43.525
POPULATION. FOR INDEED TAKEN A

01:17:43.592 --> 01:17:44.726
FULL LOW. WELL THE YOU AND

01:17:44.793 --> 01:17:47.129
THOSE ARE UPS. AND I- I TAKE

01:17:47.195 --> 01:17:48.930
THEM TO HEART AND IT MATCHES UP

01:17:48.997 --> 01:17:50.399
WITH WHAT A LOT OF STUDENTS I

01:17:50.465 --> 01:17:51.833
HAVE SAID IT WHICH IS THAT THEY

01:17:51.900 --> 01:17:53.435
CAN'T GET THE COURSES THEY NEED

01:17:53.502 --> 01:17:55.303
TO GET THROUGH. AND I THINK

01:17:55.370 --> 01:17:56.605
THAT'S WHY THERE MAY BE SOME

01:17:56.671 --> 01:17:58.473
RESISTANCE ON SOME OF THE

01:17:58.540 --> 01:18:00.108
CAMPUSES TO FULLY PUBLICIZED.

01:18:00.175 --> 01:18:02.010
THE PROGRAM BECAUSE IT MAKES IT

01:18:02.077 --> 01:18:03.078
CLEAR THE COMMITMENT OF THE

01:18:03.145 --> 01:18:05.147
UNIVERSITY TO. CREATE THAT

01:18:05.213 --> 01:18:06.381
PATHWAY AND MAKE SURE THAT

01:18:06.448 --> 01:18:08.150
STUDENTS CAN GET THOSE COURSES

01:18:08.216 --> 01:18:10.018
SO THEY CAN GET THROUGH. IT IS

01:18:10.085 --> 01:18:11.820
A DILEMMA WHEN WE WANT OUR

01:18:11.887 --> 01:18:13.422
UNIVERSITIES TO BE AS OPEN AND

01:18:13.488 --> 01:18:14.890
WELCOMING AS POSSIBLE TO AS

01:18:14.956 --> 01:18:16.792
MANY STUDENTS AS POSSIBLE. AND

01:18:16.858 --> 01:18:18.427
YOUR ENROLLMENT GROWTH SPEAKS

01:18:18.493 --> 01:18:20.162
TO WHAT A GREAT VALUE IT IS

01:18:20.228 --> 01:18:23.165
AND- AND THE IMPORTANCE THAT

01:18:23.231 --> 01:18:26.134
STUDENTS SEE AND TRYING TO- IN

01:18:26.201 --> 01:18:28.737
ROLE AT SCSU. BUT THEN IT

01:18:28.804 --> 01:18:30.639
STUDENTS ARE GETTING THROUGH.

01:18:30.705 --> 01:18:32.140
THAT THAT'S THAT'S A LOT OF

01:18:32.207 --> 01:18:34.476
UNFORTUNATE FAILURE- BECAUSE

01:18:34.543 --> 01:18:35.744
THEY'RE THEY'RE TAKING ON THE

01:18:35.811 --> 01:18:37.045
DEBT THEY'RE TAKING A TIME BUT

01:18:37.112 --> 01:18:37.813
THEY'RE NOT GETTING THEIR

01:18:37.879 --> 01:18:39.081
DEGREE SO WE HAVE TO TRY TO

01:18:39.147 --> 01:18:41.383
FIND THAT BALANCE. WE HAVE TO

01:18:41.450 --> 01:18:44.419
BE PRIORITIZED. DIG WHEN THE

01:18:44.486 --> 01:18:45.787
STUDENT IS IN A ROLE WE HAVE TO

01:18:45.854 --> 01:18:47.422
PRIORITIZE MAKING SURE THEY CAN

01:18:47.489 --> 01:18:49.491
BE SUCCESSFUL- AND THAT'S

01:18:49.558 --> 01:18:50.992
THAT'S A CHALLENGING THING TO

01:18:51.059 --> 01:18:54.096
DO BECAUSE AGAIN WE WANT TO BE

01:18:54.162 --> 01:18:58.433
OPEN ARMS TO- TO EVERYONE- I-

01:18:58.500 --> 01:18:59.367
YOU KNOW WHAT. IT A

01:18:59.434 --> 01:19:00.769
FOUNDATIONAL ELEMENT OF THE

01:19:00.836 --> 01:19:02.671
PROMISE PROGRAM IS THE FOCUS ON

01:19:02.737 --> 01:19:06.374
UNDERREPRESENTED STUDENTS- AND

01:19:06.441 --> 01:19:07.642
THAT THE PRIORITY FOR

01:19:07.709 --> 01:19:09.811
REGISTRATION THE PRIORITY FOR-

01:19:09.878 --> 01:19:11.713
ENGAGEMENT- WITH THE STUDENTS

01:19:11.780 --> 01:19:13.482
IS ON THE UNDER REPRESENTED SO

01:19:13.548 --> 01:19:14.649
IT DOES GO TO THE HEART OF

01:19:14.716 --> 01:19:16.384
WHAT. APPEARS TO BE THE STILL

01:19:16.451 --> 01:19:18.520
THE ONE OF THE BIGGER STICKING

01:19:18.587 --> 01:19:20.088
BLOCKS TOOK THE PROGRESS. IN

01:19:20.155 --> 01:19:22.691
THE GRADUATION- INITIATIVE IS

01:19:22.757 --> 01:19:25.227
THOUGH UNDER REPRESENTED. SO WE

01:19:25.293 --> 01:19:27.229
HAVE TO MATCH THOSE THINGS UP

01:19:27.295 --> 01:19:29.698
AND- AGAIN I SAID THIS IS A

01:19:29.764 --> 01:19:31.266
PARTNERSHIP AND WE WANT TO DO

01:19:31.333 --> 01:19:33.068
EVERYTHING WE CAN TO HELP YOU-

01:19:33.135 --> 01:19:37.539
AND SUCCEEDING. IN DOING SO.

01:19:37.606 --> 01:19:39.174
ONE OF THE THAT THE CHALLENGES

01:19:39.241 --> 01:19:40.642
THAT WE HAVE- IN TERMS OF

01:19:40.709 --> 01:19:41.877
SETTING POLICY IS THE

01:19:41.943 --> 01:19:43.812
AVAILABILITY OF DATA. BECAUSE

01:19:43.879 --> 01:19:45.013
WE WANT THE FACTS ON WHAT'S

01:19:45.080 --> 01:19:47.249
HAPPENING IN ALL ASPECTS OF

01:19:47.315 --> 01:19:48.650
STATE GOVERNMENT INCLUDING

01:19:48.717 --> 01:19:51.386
HIGHER EDUCATION. AND SO WE ARE

01:19:51.453 --> 01:19:52.754
INTERESTED IN UNDERSTANDING WHO

01:19:52.821 --> 01:19:54.322
IS PARTICIPATING IN THE PROMISE

01:19:54.389 --> 01:19:56.191
PROGRAM ARE WE REACHING THE

01:19:56.258 --> 01:19:57.726
CONSTITUENCIES THAT WE ARE

01:19:57.792 --> 01:20:00.061
TRYING TO REACH WITH IT IN

01:20:00.128 --> 01:20:02.164
TERMS OF UNDER REPRESENTED. AND

01:20:02.230 --> 01:20:03.532
SO- I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN

01:20:03.598 --> 01:20:05.734
SPEAK TODAY OR WE CAN TALK AND

01:20:05.800 --> 01:20:06.701
FOLLOW UP OUTSIDE OF THIS

01:20:06.768 --> 01:20:08.403
HEARING. BUT WE REALLY ARE

01:20:08.470 --> 01:20:10.205
LOOKING FOR THAT THAT THAT THAT

01:20:10.272 --> 01:20:11.973
THE DATA THAT'S BEEN COLLECTED

01:20:12.040 --> 01:20:14.609
ON THE PROMISE PROGRAM AND WHO.

01:20:14.676 --> 01:20:16.077
WHO ARE WE HELPING ARE WE HELP

01:20:16.144 --> 01:20:17.612
AND WE WANT TO HELP EVERYBODY

01:20:17.679 --> 01:20:18.947
BUT ARE WE HELPING THE RIGHT

01:20:19.014 --> 01:20:20.248
FOLKS ARE WE INVESTING OUR

01:20:20.315 --> 01:20:22.083
RESOURCES IN THE RIGHT WAY. I

01:20:22.150 --> 01:20:24.219
KNOW THAT'S YOUR- COMMITMENT AS

01:20:24.286 --> 01:20:26.588
WELL- AND THE AVAILABILITY OF

01:20:26.655 --> 01:20:27.689
THAT DATA REALLY WOULD HELP ALL

01:20:27.756 --> 01:20:30.926
OF US. MAKE SURE WE'RE MAKING

01:20:30.992 --> 01:20:36.031
THE BEST CHOICES DR MINOR.

01:20:36.097 --> 01:20:38.033
WHENEVER I LOOK FORWARD TO THAT

01:20:38.099 --> 01:20:39.968
CONVERSATION AND I WILL TAKE

01:20:40.035 --> 01:20:41.803
THE RESPONSIBILITY TO GO BACK

01:20:41.870 --> 01:20:44.005
TO OUR TEAM- IN THE

01:20:44.072 --> 01:20:45.373
CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE TO GET AS

01:20:45.440 --> 01:20:47.342
MUCH INFORMATION AS WE POSSIBLY

01:20:47.409 --> 01:20:49.411
CAN ABOUT PRECISELY WHO'S

01:20:49.477 --> 01:20:51.313
PARTICIPATING. AND THE PROMISE

01:20:51.379 --> 01:20:53.348
PROGRAM ACROSS OUR CAMPUSES BUT

01:20:53.415 --> 01:20:55.517
I THINK. THE DELICATE BALANCE

01:20:55.584 --> 01:20:57.319
THAT YOU JUST ARTICULATED IS SO

01:20:57.385 --> 01:20:59.754
TRUE. PARTICULARLY WITH UNDER

01:20:59.821 --> 01:21:01.456
REPRESENTED STUDENTS OR

01:21:01.523 --> 01:21:03.024
STUDENTS WERE THE FIRST IN

01:21:03.091 --> 01:21:04.693
THEIR FAMILY TO GO TO COLLEGE

01:21:04.759 --> 01:21:06.394
FOR FIRST GENERATION STUDENTS

01:21:06.461 --> 01:21:08.363
FOR OUR STUDENTS WHO COME FROM

01:21:08.430 --> 01:21:10.232
LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. AND THIS

01:21:10.298 --> 01:21:12.100
BALANCE BETWEEN MAKING IT

01:21:12.167 --> 01:21:14.369
AVAILABLE TO ALL STUDENTS AND

01:21:14.436 --> 01:21:15.704
THEM BEING ABLE TO FULLY

01:21:15.770 --> 01:21:17.606
CAPITALIZE ON THE OPPORTUNITY

01:21:17.672 --> 01:21:19.374
TO TAKE A FULL COURSE LOAD WE

01:21:19.441 --> 01:21:21.543
KNOW. THAT THOSE STUDENTS TEND

01:21:21.610 --> 01:21:23.979
TO. BE MORE LIKELY TO WORK. NO

01:21:24.045 --> 01:21:25.447
STUDENTS ARE MORE LIKELY TO

01:21:25.513 --> 01:21:27.749
HAVE FAMILY OBLIGATIONS THEREBY

01:21:27.816 --> 01:21:29.584
AND PERHAPS IN SOME CASES NOT

01:21:29.651 --> 01:21:31.119
ALL CASES LIMITING THEIR

01:21:31.186 --> 01:21:33.688
ABILITY. TO ACTUALLY TAKE

01:21:33.755 --> 01:21:34.489
FIFTEEN UNITS IN ANY GIVEN

01:21:34.556 --> 01:21:36.191
SEMESTER SOL I THINK IT'S A

01:21:36.258 --> 01:21:38.126
GREAT QUESTION AND ONE THAT WE

01:21:38.193 --> 01:21:41.896
LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING. SOME

01:21:41.963 --> 01:21:42.931
ONGOING CONVERSATION ABOUT. AB

01:21:42.998 --> 01:21:43.498
TERRIFIC AND I WE'RE GETTING

01:21:43.565 --> 01:21:44.432
FROM THE PUBLIC POLICY

01:21:44.499 --> 01:21:46.735
INSTITUTE IN A MOMENT. WHO CAN

01:21:46.801 --> 01:21:48.937
TALK ABOUT- COURSE LOADS- AND I

01:21:49.004 --> 01:21:50.238
THINK THEY'RE STUDY SHOWS THAT

01:21:50.305 --> 01:21:51.072
I THINK YOU KNOW THAT THEIR

01:21:51.139 --> 01:21:52.941
COURSE LOADS HAVE REALLY GONE

01:21:53.008 --> 01:21:54.376
UP OVER THE LAST THREE OR FOUR

01:21:54.442 --> 01:21:55.610
YEARS I MEAN AGAIN IT'S TAKE A

01:21:55.677 --> 01:21:57.012
CREDIT TO THAT. CAMPUS

01:21:57.078 --> 01:21:58.613
LEADERSHIP IN THE FACULTY AND

01:21:58.680 --> 01:22:00.515
THE AND THE SYSTEM. TO SEE THAT

01:22:00.582 --> 01:22:05.420
<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt;ROWTH IN AND COURSE LOADS- BUT&lt;/c&gt;</u>

01:22:05.487 --> 01:22:07.122
EIGHT EIGHT. I'M NOT SO SURE

01:22:07.188 --> 01:22:09.324
THAT THE WORK OBLIGATION IS

01:22:09.391 --> 01:22:11.026
NECESSARY EIGHTY EIGHT

01:22:11.092 --> 01:22:12.027
DIFFERENTIAL BETWEEN A

01:22:12.093 --> 01:22:13.628
STUDENT'S DESIRED IT STILL TAKE

01:22:13.695 --> 01:22:14.896
THE FULL COURSE LOAD TO GET

01:22:14.963 --> 01:22:16.831
THROUGH IN FOUR YEARS. THEY

01:22:16.898 --> 01:22:17.365
KNOW THE ECONOMICS OF THE

01:22:17.432 --> 01:22:19.934
MATTER TO- THAT THE QUICKER

01:22:20.001 --> 01:22:21.503
THEY CAN GET 2 DEGREES THE MORE

01:22:21.569 --> 01:22:23.038
MONEY THEY'RE GOING TO SAVE.

01:22:23.104 --> 01:22:24.539
THE GREATER OPPORTUNITY TO EARN

01:22:24.606 --> 01:22:26.341
MORE AND ENTER OUR ECONOMIC

01:22:26.408 --> 01:22:28.877
SYSTEM. SO AT LEAST THE DATA

01:22:28.943 --> 01:22:30.345
THAT I HAVE SEEN IS THAT THAT

01:22:30.412 --> 01:22:31.880
THAT- THERE ISN'T A BIG

01:22:31.946 --> 01:22:34.983
DIFFERENTIAL- IN- THE STUDENTS

01:22:35.050 --> 01:22:35.950
WHO ARE TRYING TO TAKE THAT

01:22:36.017 --> 01:22:38.053

CRASHING. ON THE ROCKS WHEN-

01:34:46.514 --> 01:34:50.151
THEY CAN'T FINISH AND- AND ALL

01:34:50.217 --> 01:34:51.552
OF US SERVE COMMITTED TO TRYING

01:34:51.619 --> 01:34:53.320
TO FIND THOSE BOTTLENECKS THE

01:34:53.387 --> 01:34:55.256
ROAD BLOCKS THAT ARE CREATING

01:34:55.322 --> 01:34:58.926
THAT. BARRIER TO COMPLETION- DO

01:34:58.993 --> 01:35:00.461
YOU FIND OUT WHEN YOU TALK TO

01:35:00.528 --> 01:35:01.695
THE STATE- IT THE STUDENT

01:35:01.762 --> 01:35:02.763
COMMUNITY AND I KNOW WE'RE

01:35:02.830 --> 01:35:03.564
DOING YOU KNOW IT'S HARD TO

01:35:03.631 --> 01:35:05.166
GENERALIZE IT YOU KNOW ITS

01:35:05.232 --> 01:35:09.804
TWENTY THREE CAMPUSES. ALL OF

01:35:09.870 --> 01:35:10.871
THEM HAVE UNIQUE SITUATIONS.

01:35:10.938 --> 01:35:11.372
YOU'VE HEARD SOME OF THE

01:35:11.439 --> 01:35:13.541
EARLIER. THAT ON SOME CAN. SAN

01:35:13.607 --> 01:35:15.276
JOSE AND CAL STATE LONG BEACH

01:35:15.342 --> 01:35:17.311
INSECT STATE THOUSANDS OF

01:35:17.378 --> 01:35:19.480
STUDENTS HAVE BEEN ROLLED. IN

01:35:19.547 --> 01:35:20.915
THE CALIFORNIA PROMISE PROGRAM

01:35:20.981 --> 01:35:22.850
WHERE THEY KNOW THAT FOR YOUR

01:35:22.917 --> 01:35:24.552
PAST THAT THEY DO SO. THEY TAKE

01:35:24.618 --> 01:35:25.553
THE FIFTEEN UNITS THAT THERE'S

01:35:25.619 --> 01:35:27.221
AGO PROMISE A GUARANTEE THAT

01:35:27.288 --> 01:35:28.255
THEY CAN GET THROUGH IN FOUR

01:35:28.322 --> 01:35:29.990
YEARS. SO WE HAVE A ROBUST

01:35:30.057 --> 01:35:31.592
PARTICIPATION ON SOME CAMPUSES

01:35:31.659 --> 01:35:33.561
AND THEN THEN WE HAVE A DESERT

01:35:33.627 --> 01:35:36.297
IN OTHERS YOU HAVE ANY INSIGHT

01:35:36.363 --> 01:35:39.767
OVER THAT ON THAT ISSUE. I

01:35:39.834 --> 01:35:41.402
THINK YOU KNOW TO HARM HONEST

01:35:41.469 --> 01:35:44.572
HERE. IT'S JUST LIKE YOU SAID

01:35:44.638 --> 01:35:46.740
VASTLY DIFFERENT ACROSS THE CSU

01:35:46.807 --> 01:35:48.909
SO IT REALLY IS I THINK AT THIS

01:35:48.976 --> 01:35:50.711
POINT JUST CAMPUS DEPENDENT AND

01:35:50.778 --> 01:35:52.012
THE EFFORTS THAT EACH CAMPUS

01:35:52.079 --> 01:35:54.181
ONE SUPPORT- IN PROMOTING THE

01:35:54.248 --> 01:35:57.585
PROGRAM. WELL IT WE APPRECIATE

01:35:57.651 --> 01:35:59.620
THE LEADERSHIP OF THE CSSA AND-

01:35:59.687 --> 01:36:00.921
<u>ND WOULD WELCOME THE</u>

01:36:00.988 --> 01:36:02.556
PARTNERSHIP AND TRYING TO BRING

01:36:02.623 --> 01:36:04.425
THE AWARENESS OF THAT PROGRAM

01:36:04.492 --> 01:36:05.860
TO SOME OF THESE CAMPUSES THAT

01:36:05.926 --> 01:36:07.761
HAVE LOW PARTICIPATION RATES.

01:36:07.828 --> 01:36:09.497
SO LOW WE COULD WORK TOGETHER

01:36:09.563 --> 01:36:11.565
TO IMPROVE FINANCIAL AID. AND

01:36:11.632 --> 01:36:13.501
TRIAL LOWER OR ELIMINATE

01:36:13.567 --> 01:36:15.436
STUDENT DEBT. THAT WE CAN MAKE

01:36:15.503 --> 01:36:17.071
A MORE STUDENTS AWARE OF THIS

01:36:17.138 --> 01:36:19.340
CLEAR PATHWAY TO SUCCESS THAT

01:36:19.406 --> 01:36:21.342
THAT IS OUT THERE FOR THEM. BUT

01:38:47.788 --> 01:38:48.989
INITIATIVE TO TWENTY FIVE AS AS

01:38:49.056 --> 01:38:51.859
YOU KNOW THE CALIFORNIA. BROKE

01:38:51.925 --> 01:38:52.359
IN OUR RESEARCH WE USED

01:38:52.426 --> 01:38:53.727
PUBLICLY AVAILABLE DATA FROM

01:38:53.794 --> 01:38:55.095
THE CSU ENROLLMENT PASSWORDS

01:38:55.162 --> 01:38:57.464
BUT ALL WE GOT. DAY FROM FOUR

01:38:57.531 --> 01:38:59.600
K. VOLUNTEERED THEIR D.

01:38:59.667 --> 01:39:02.169
IDENTIFIED LONGITUDINAL DATA.

01:39:02.236 --> 01:39:04.872
AND SALES. THE MAIN FINDING

01:39:04.938 --> 01:39:08.275
FROM THIS. FIRST MOST STUDENTS

01:39:08.342 --> 01:39:09.476
DO NOT TAKE UP UNITS TO BE ON

01:39:09.543 --> 01:39:11.145
TO GRADUATE FOUR EARS. OUR

01:39:11.211 --> 01:39:12.780
FINANCIAL PURPOSES STUDENTS ARE

01:39:12.846 --> 01:39:14.748
FULL TIME AT UNITS TO- BUT IT

01:39:14.815 --> 01:39:15.549
TAKES AVERAGE OF FIFTEEN YEARS

01:39:15.616 --> 01:39:17.418
TERM THIRTY PER YEAR. AFTER

01:39:17.484 --> 01:39:18.786
GRADUATE TIME THE TYPICAL

01:39:18.852 --> 01:39:19.987
STUDENT ROLLS IN ONLY ABOUT

01:39:20.054 --> 01:39:21.288
THIRTEEN UNITS PARTNER. THE

01:39:21.355 --> 01:39:22.790
MOST RECENT DATA WE HAVE SHOW

01:39:22.856 --> 01:39:24.124
THAT AROUND 43% OF

01:39:24.191 --> 01:39:25.492
UNDERGRADUATES ENROLLED FIFTEEN

01:39:25.559 --> 01:39:28.662
UNITS WHICH IS UP FROM JUST

01:39:28.729 --> 01:39:30.331
ABOUT A THIRD. FIVE YEARS AGO.

01:39:30.397 --> 01:39:31.565
SECOND OUR STUDENTS ENROLLING

01:39:31.632 --> 01:39:32.966
IN A FULL COURSE LOAD ARE MORE

01:39:33.033 --> 01:39:34.501
LIKELY TO FINISH ON TIME.

01:39:34.568 --> 01:39:35.803
CENTRAL FIFTEEN UNITS AND

01:39:35.869 --> 01:39:36.770
THEY'RE JUST THEY'RE VERY FIRST

01:39:36.837 --> 01:39:37.705
TERM ARE ABOUT ELEVEN

01:39:37.771 --> 01:39:38.572
PERCENTAGE POINTS MORE LIKELY

01:39:38.639 --> 01:39:40.341
ABOUT TWICE AS LIKELY TO FINISH

01:39:40.407 --> 01:39:42.710
ON TIME. AND A LITTLE MORE

01:39:42.776 --> 01:39:43.344
LIKELY TO GRADUATE IN SIX YEARS

01:39:43.410 --> 01:39:45.245
AS WELL. AND THIS IS NOT JUST A

01:39:45.312 --> 01:39:46.814
CASE OF MORE PREPARED STUDENTS

01:39:46.880 --> 01:39:48.148
TAKING MORE UNITS AND THE MORE

01:39:48.215 --> 01:39:50.250
LIKE THE GRADUATE ANYWAY. WE

01:39:50.317 --> 01:39:50.951
WERE ABLE TO USE THE STUDENT

01:39:51.018 --> 01:39:52.019
LEVEL LONGITUDINAL DATA FROM

01:39:52.086 --> 01:39:53.821
THE CAMPUSES. TO DETERMINE THAT

01:39:53.887 --> 01:39:55.055
THIS RELATIONSHIP EXISTS FOR.

01:39:55.122 --> 01:39:56.256

CITY SCORES. ADD TO THAT NO WE

01:40:04.231 --> 01:40:04.932
FOUND SOME REALLY. A IT'S

01:40:04.998 --> 01:40:06.166
ENOUGH TO PROMISING TRENDS OF

01:40:06.233 --> 01:40:08.302
COURSE. IT'S A CALIFORNIA

01:40:08.369 --> 01:40:10.371
PROMISED. AND A GRADUATION IN

TWENTY FIVE START. ALMOST EVERY.

01:40:11.839 --> 01:40:19.680
HAS DRAMATICALLY INCREASED.

01:40:19.747 --> 01:40:21.749
THERE WE GO HAS DRAMATICALLY

01:40:21.815 --> 01:40:22.516
INCREASED THE NUMBER OF

01:40:22.583 --> 01:40:24.151
FRESHMEN TAKING FIFTEEN UNITS

01:40:24.218 --> 01:40:26.754
ARE MORE IT IS ALSO ON PAGE

TWO CAMPUSES DIDN'T. WE'RE

01:40:36.663 --> 01:40:38.565
ALREADY VERY HIGH IN THE THAT-

01:40:38.632 --> 01:40:40.167
PERCENT PRESS TAKING FIFTEEN

01:40:40.234 --> 01:40:42.803
MORE UNITS VERY FIRST ARE.

01:40:42.870 --> 01:40:44.505
WELCOME TAKING INCREASED FOR

01:40:44.571 --> 01:40:46.540
ALL STUDENTS MANY GAPS STILL

01:40:46.607 --> 01:40:49.309
REMAIN BETWEEN GROUPS. AS YOU

01:40:49.376 --> 01:40:50.310
CAN SEE ON PAGE NINETEEN THE

01:40:50.377 --> 01:40:53.647
REPORT IN FALL OF 2019407% OF

01:40:53.714 --> 01:40:54.681
WHITE STUDENTS ENROLLED FIFTEEN

01:40:54.748 --> 01:40:56.483
OR MORE UNITS COMPARED 239% OF

AFRICAN AMERICANS AND FORTY PER

01:40:58.452 --> 01:41:00.721
1% LATINOS. THERE'S ALSO AN

01:41:00.788 --> 01:41:01.755
EIGHT POINT GAP BETWEEN FIRST

01:41:01.822 --> 01:41:03.123
GENERATION STUDENT COLLEGES AND

01:41:03.190 --> 01:41:04.358
APPEARS AND THERE'S A SIX POINT

01:41:04.425 --> 01:41:05.492
GAP BETWEEN HEALTH GRANT

01:41:05.559 --> 01:41:07.261
RECIPIENTS OF THEIR PEERS. THE

01:41:07.327 --> 01:41:08.595
GOOD NEWS IS THAT EARLY COURSE

01:41:08.662 --> 01:41:10.864
TAKING MOMENTUM. SEEMS TO HELP

01:41:10.931 --> 01:41:12.800
ALL TYPES OF STUDENTS AND IT

01:41:12.866 --> 01:41:13.434
SUGGESTS THAT CLOSING GAPS IN

01:41:13.500 --> 01:41:15.235
OPPORTUNITY. COULD HELP CLOSE

01:41:15.302 --> 01:41:18.305
THESE GAPS IN OUTCOMES THAT WE

01:41:18.372 --> 01:41:26.814
SEE LATER ON. SO. WE SUGGEST

01:41:26.880 --> 01:41:28.282
ENABLING AND FACILITATING MORE

01:41:28.348 --> 01:41:29.349

I'M GLAD WE WERE ABLE TO CLEAR

01:43:00.274 --> 01:43:02.276
UP THE- THE TECHNICAL ISSUES IN

01:43:02.342 --> 01:43:05.112
HERE YOU'RE TERRIFIC TESTIMONY-

01:43:05.178 --> 01:43:07.648
SO IT IS YOU. OBVIOUSLY HAVE

01:43:07.714 --> 01:43:09.116
THIS FOCUS ON THE FULL THAT

01:43:09.182 --> 01:43:10.651
TAKING THE FIFTEEN UNITS TAKING

01:43:10.717 --> 01:43:12.452
IT EARLY. MAKING A BIG

01:43:12.519 --> 01:43:14.254
DIFFERENCE- IRRESPECTIVE OF THE

01:43:14.321 --> 01:43:15.622
OF WHERE THAT STUDENT COMES

01:43:15.689 --> 01:43:18.492
FROM A BENEFITS THE UNDER

01:43:18.559 --> 01:43:18.992
REPRESENTED IT BENEFITS

01:43:19.059 --> 01:43:22.095
EVERYONE- BUT THE YOU KNOW THE

01:43:22.162 --> 01:43:23.497
BAY. THAT THEY YOU'RE HERE FROM

01:43:23.564 --> 01:43:26.266
THE CAMPUSES IS THAT- YOU KNOW

01:43:26.333 --> 01:43:27.768
THE BOTTLENECKS COURSES THAT

01:43:27.834 --> 01:43:28.669
THEY WANT TO TAKE THAT THEY

01:43:28.735 --> 01:43:31.004
NEED AS A PREREQUISITE BUT BABY

01:43:31.071 --> 01:43:32.739
ISN'T AVAILABLE. DO YOU HAVE

01:43:32.806 --> 01:43:34.141
ANY THOUGHTS AT PERSPECTIVES

01:43:34.207 --> 01:43:36.176
ABOUT HOW DO WE HOW DO WE BREAK

01:43:36.243 --> 01:43:38.045
THAT DOWN. HOW DO WE HELP THE

01:43:38.111 --> 01:43:39.913
CAMPUSES HAD A WE BREAK DOWN

01:43:39.980 --> 01:43:42.716
THOSE BARRIERS SO THAT- THE

01:43:42.783 --> 01:43:44.284
STUDENTS WHO ARE TAKING THE

01:43:44.351 --> 01:43:45.652
FULL COURSE LOADS ARE ABLE TO

01:43:45.719 --> 01:43:46.853
TAKE THE COURSES THAT THEY NEED

01:43:46.920 --> 01:43:48.188
TO BE DONE ANY WORK ON THAT OR

01:43:48.255 --> 01:43:50.223
ANY THOUGHTS ON THAT THAT THAT

01:43:50.290 --> 01:43:52.626
ISSUE. A COUPLE YEARS AGO WE

01:43:52.693 --> 01:43:53.660
GET A REPORT ON GRADUATION THE

01:43:53.727 --> 01:43:54.628
FIRST GRADUATION INITIATIVE

01:43:54.695 --> 01:43:56.964
WHICH WAS AIMED. AT SIX YEAR

01:43:57.030 --> 01:43:58.031
GRADUATION RATES. AND WE FOUND

01:43:58.098 --> 01:44:01.201
THAT- CAMPUSES WHERE TRYING TO

01:44:01.268 --> 01:44:01.868
STREAMLINE THEIR DEGREE

01:44:01.935 --> 01:44:04.404
PROGRAMS. SO THAT THEY DIDN'T

01:44:04.471 --> 01:44:05.839
HAVE THOSE BOTTLENECK COURSES.

01:44:05.906 --> 01:44:07.307
THAT WAS ONE OF ONE OF THEIR

01:44:07.374 --> 01:44:09.009
STRATEGIES AND IT CONTINUES WE

01:44:09.076 --> 01:44:11.511
WANT OTHER STRATEGIES- YOU'RE

01:44:11.578 --> 01:44:13.080
EXACTLY RIGHT IT'S NOT JUST A

01:44:13.146 --> 01:44:15.649
FIFTEEN UNIT- BLANK CHECK IT TO

01:44:15.716 --> 01:44:17.918
BE THE RIGHT FIFTEEN. AND IT

01:44:17.985 --> 01:44:19.086
CONSIDER USING ANALYTICS FIGURE

01:44:19.152 --> 01:44:19.953
THAT OUT A LOT OF CAMPUS WE

01:44:20.020 --> 01:44:22.122
TALKED TO WERE OPTIMISED EVEN

01:44:22.189 --> 01:44:22.889
IN THE FACE OF CODE THAT THEY

01:44:22.956 --> 01:44:24.558
CAN GET. THE COURSES THE

01:44:24.625 --> 01:44:27.694
STUDENTS- THAT THAT NEEDED THEM

01:44:27.761 --> 01:44:29.329
THE RIGHT TO STUDENTS IN THE

01:44:29.396 --> 01:44:31.965
THEM- A SO THEY'RE USING TECH.

01:44:32.032 --> 01:44:34.668
THAT THAT IT TO GET PAST THIS.

01:44:34.735 --> 01:44:36.303
BUT YES IT'S A MAJOR CAN THAT

01:44:36.370 --> 01:44:37.371
THAT IS NOT JUST COURSES EVERY

01:44:37.437 --> 01:44:43.710
BUT THE RIGHT COURSES ARE. IT'S

01:44:43.777 --> 01:44:48.048
IT IN YOUR STUDY- AS- A SIMPLE.

01:44:48.115 --> 01:44:49.449
POINT THAT NINE PER. IS IN

01:44:49.516 --> 01:44:50.617
PERCENT OF THIS TO THAT ENTER.

01:44:50.684 --> 01:44:51.818
HOPE TO GET AND FOR YEARS IS

01:44:51.885 --> 01:44:56.323
THAT- DAY COME FOR EUROPE. I

01:44:56.390 --> 01:44:56.857
COME FROM A SURVEY AND ASH

01:44:56.923 --> 01:45:01.461
SURVEY. OF AND I EXPECT THAT.

01:45:01.528 --> 01:45:03.130
CSU STUDENTS ARE MUCH- THERE'S

01:45:03.196 --> 01:45:05.232
A THERE'S ANOTHER- I THINK

01:45:05.298 --> 01:45:06.466
OVERSEE PER OF YOU SEE STUDENTS

01:45:06.533 --> 01:45:08.035
EXPECTED SAME THING- WE DON'T

01:45:08.101 --> 01:45:10.003
HAVE NUMBERS ON ON- YOU ON CSU

01:45:10.070 --> 01:45:12.239
STUDENT EXPECTATION- BUT IT'S

01:45:12.305 --> 01:45:13.707
SAFE TO SAY THAT. MORE STUDENTS

01:45:13.774 --> 01:45:15.475
LIKELY EXPECTS TO GRADUATE IN

01:45:15.542 --> 01:45:16.610
FOUR YEARS THAT DO GRADUATING

01:45:16.677 --> 01:45:18.679
FOUR YEARS. AND SO WE HAVE

01:45:18.745 --> 01:45:22.115
HEARD- A- IN SOME WAYS I GUESS

01:45:22.182 --> 01:45:24.284
IT'S A REALITY CHECK- THAT THAT

01:45:24.351 --> 01:45:26.420
THAT. IS STUDENTS WHO DON'T

01:45:26.486 --> 01:45:27.921
HAVE THE MONEY THAT THEY'RE

01:45:27.988 --> 01:45:29.423
TAKING OUT FINANCIALLY BUT THEY

01:45:29.489 --> 01:45:31.792
THEY MAY NEED TO WORK- AND THAT

01:45:31.858 --> 01:45:33.660
CREATES- THAT ADDITIONAL YOU

01:45:33.727 --> 01:45:35.262
KNOW BERRIER THAT THEY HAVE TO

01:45:35.328 --> 01:45:36.229
OVERCOME IN TERMS OF TAKING A

01:45:36.296 --> 01:45:38.732
FULL LOAD. OF UNITS TO IT ANY

01:45:38.799 --> 01:45:40.701
THAT DATA ABOUT THE DESIRE DO

01:45:40.767 --> 01:45:42.102
YOU SEE ANY BREAKDOWN IN TERMS

01:45:42.169 --> 01:45:47.040
OF THOSE- BASED ON. STUDENTS

01:45:47.107 --> 01:45:47.607
WHO ARE WORKING IN THOSE WHO

01:45:47.674 --> 01:45:48.675
ARE NOT. SO THAT DATA WAS

01:45:48.742 --> 01:45:50.944
AVAILABLE AT IT'S REALLY A

01:45:51.011 --> 01:45:53.413
REALLY INTERESTING QUESTION- I

01:45:53.480 --> 01:45:57.317
THINK- AS EARLY- GIVEN EARLIER

01:45:57.384 --> 01:45:58.885
TESTIMONY I THINK A COMEDY OF

01:45:58.952 --> 01:46:00.053
MANY THINGS TO. ONE IS THAT THE

01:46:00.120 --> 01:46:03.056
COURTS THE STUDENTS NEED ARE-

01:46:03.123 --> 01:46:04.424
ONE IS THAT THAT I'M NOT COURSE

01:46:04.491 --> 01:46:06.393
IS AVAILABLE AND ANOTHER IS-

01:46:06.460 --> 01:46:09.629
THE BEST. I IT- STUDENTS BEING

01:46:09.696 --> 01:46:12.299
AND- OR- HAVE TO WORK. I KNOW

01:46:12.365 --> 01:46:13.800
BEING ABLE TO TAKE A FULL LOAD-

01:46:13.867 --> 01:46:16.536
SURELY NOT ALL- WILL BE ABLE TO

01:46:16.603 --> 01:46:17.871
ENROLL IN FULL COURSE BUT I

01:46:17.938 --> 01:46:19.406
THINK. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE-

01:46:19.473 --> 01:46:20.907
INCREASES IN THE PAST FOUR

01:46:20.974 --> 01:46:24.978
YEARS- YOU CAN SEE THAT- IT'S

01:46:25.045 --> 01:46:26.246
BEEN A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF

01:46:26.313 --> 01:46:27.714
INCREASED AT ALMOST EVERY

01:46:27.781 --> 01:46:29.449
SINGLE CAMPUS. SO THERE WAS

01:46:29.516 --> 01:46:31.518
UNMET DEMANDS THERE THAT THAT

01:46:31.585 --> 01:46:34.588
WAS EITHER CREATED OR OR OR- OR

01:46:34.654 --> 01:46:36.690
WORKED AROUND EVEN FOR STUDENTS

01:46:36.757 --> 01:46:38.492
WHO ARE POTENTIALLY WORKING-

01:46:38.558 --> 01:46:40.427
AND SO I THINK THAT THERE'S IN

01:46:40.494 --> 01:46:41.094
ORDER TO MAINTAIN AND EVEN

01:46:41.161 --> 01:46:46.733
INCREASE. THOSE NUMBERS EITHER.

01:46:46.800 --> 01:46:47.300
STILL NEED TO BE A FOCUS ON

01:46:47.367 --> 01:46:49.736
THIS. THANK YOU ARE. REID THANK

01:46:49.803 --> 01:46:50.604
BEFORE WE MOVE. I WANT TO MAKE

01:46:50.670 --> 01:46:54.975
SURE INCLUDE YOU. FROM. YOU'RE

01:46:55.041 --> 01:46:56.843
JUST ONE- YOU KNOW GIVEN THE

01:46:56.910 --> 01:46:59.646
FACT THAT MOST OF YOU CAN. OKAY

01:46:59.713 --> 01:47:03.683
IS NOW ONLINE FORCED. THE SCOPE

01:47:03.750 --> 01:47:07.220
NINETY- ENDEMIC THAT THE US-

01:47:07.287 --> 01:47:10.957
AND FRANK THE THAT ON MY AND-

01:47:11.024 --> 01:47:12.726
MAY CONTAIN- ONCE WE RID TO

01:47:12.793 --> 01:47:14.161
CAMP SAID YOU AT LEAST IN

01:47:14.227 --> 01:47:16.163
PERILLO ON CARE SAID YOU. WHAT

01:47:16.229 --> 01:47:20.033
IMPACT DO YOU. I BELIEVE THAT

01:47:20.100 --> 01:47:22.369
THE ONLINE EDUCATION-

01:47:22.435 --> 01:47:25.772
INITIATIVE WILL HAVE ON THESE

01:47:25.839 --> 01:47:27.707
BOTTLENECKS COURSES AND THE

01:47:27.774 --> 01:47:29.543
INABILITY TO OUR STUDENTS TO

01:47:29.609 --> 01:47:33.113
GRADUATE WITHIN FOUR YEARS OR

01:47:33.180 --> 01:47:35.148
FIVE YEARS OR IN SOME CASES. HI

01:47:35.215 --> 01:47:36.616
THIS IS A GREAT QUESTION THANKS

01:47:36.683 --> 01:47:40.887
SENTARA- SO. RESEARCH TAKES

01:47:40.954 --> 01:47:42.556
AWHILE AND BUT WHEN WE STARTED

01:47:42.622 --> 01:47:43.824
THIS REJECTION DURING MOST THE

01:47:43.890 --> 01:47:45.091
TIME TO RESEARCH WAS DONE. WE

01:47:45.158 --> 01:47:46.259
DO NOT KNOW THE CODE- WOULD

01:47:46.326 --> 01:47:49.062
CHANGE THINGS QUITE A BIT- BUT

01:47:49.129 --> 01:47:50.197
IF YOU HAVE A CHANCE TO TALK TO

01:47:50.263 --> 01:47:52.432
SEVERAL CAMPUSES ABOUT THIS AND

01:47:52.499 --> 01:47:55.635
ARE OPTIMISTIC THAT- ONLINE

01:47:55.702 --> 01:47:57.771
COURSES COULD BE HELP IN

01:47:57.838 --> 01:47:58.772
GETTING STUDENTS GRADUATE

01:47:58.839 --> 01:48:00.340
SOONER THAN ESPECIALLY TYING UP

01:48:00.407 --> 01:48:01.508
THE LAST QUESTION STUDENTS TO

01:48:01.575 --> 01:48:03.310
WORK A LOT OF ONLINE COURSES

01:48:03.376 --> 01:48:04.077
HAVE BECOME ASYNCHRONOUS

01:48:04.144 --> 01:48:05.445
COURSES WHICH MEANS STUDENTS

01:48:05.512 --> 01:48:07.080
CAN WORK ON THOSE BACKWARDS

01:48:07.147 --> 01:48:08.315
WORK WHEN THEY- ARE ABLE TO

01:48:08.381 --> 01:48:09.816
WORK ON IT SO THEY'RE NOT TIED

01:48:09.883 --> 01:48:10.383
TO A CERTAIN TIME THAT MAYBE

01:48:10.450 --> 01:48:12.285
DURING WORK HOURS- SO IT'S

01:48:12.352 --> 01:48:14.287
POSSIBLE. THAT IF ONLINE

01:48:14.354 --> 01:48:15.355
COURSES CONTINUE THIS COULD BE

01:48:15.422 --> 01:48:17.657
ONE WAY- THAT- COMBINING IT

01:48:17.724 --> 01:48:19.626
WITH OTHER THINGS- AND OTHER

01:48:19.693 --> 01:48:22.462
SUPPORTS THAT CAMPUS COULD HELP

01:48:22.529 --> 01:48:24.564
EASE THOSE BOTTLENECKS OR HELP

01:48:24.631 --> 01:48:25.699
STUDENTS GET THE COURSES THEY

01:48:25.765 --> 01:48:29.870

THAT THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION

02:01:06.726 --> 02:01:07.927
IT SENDS A MESSAGE TO THEIR

02:01:07.994 --> 02:01:09.996
BROTHERS AND THEIR SISTERS-

02:01:10.062 --> 02:01:12.264

HAVE- THEIR DREAMS THAT.

02:01:14.634 --> 02:01:17.670
ACTUALLY CREATED AND FULFILLED-

02:01:17.737 --> 02:01:20.106
GOING FORWARD- AND WE KNOW FROM

02:01:20.172 --> 02:01:21.273
THE TESTIMONY WE HEARD TODAY

02:01:21.340 --> 02:01:23.376
THAT- THAT THE LONGER STUDENTS

02:01:23.442 --> 02:01:27.279
STAYS IN. SCHOOL THE LESS

02:01:27.346 --> 02:01:27.880
LIKELY THEY ARE TO GRADUATE.

02:01:27.947 --> 02:01:28.414
AND IF THEY CAN STILL OFF

02:01:28.481 --> 02:01:29.982
STRONG AND TAKE THOSE FIFTEEN

02:01:30.049 --> 02:01:31.484
UNITS AT THE BEGINNING THAT IT

02:01:31.550 --> 02:01:33.619
INCREASES THEIR LIKELIHOOD OF

02:01:33.686 --> 02:01:36.989
SUCCESS SO MUCH. MORE SO IT'S

02:01:37.056 --> 02:01:38.924
IMPERATIVE THAT WE CONTINUE TO

02:01:38.991 --> 02:01:40.459
WORK TOGETHER TO INSURE

02:01:40.526 --> 02:01:42.395
STUDENTS CAN MAKE PROGRESS.

02:01:42.461 --> 02:01:44.997
TOWARDS A DEGREE- THAT THAT DAY

02:01:45.064 --> 02:01:46.232
IN SOME WAYS WE'RE TRYING TO

02:01:46.298 --> 02:01:48.668
SHIFT BACK TO- THE TRADITIONAL

02:01:48.734 --> 02:01:49.869
FOR YOUR MODEL IT BECAME A

02:01:49.935 --> 02:01:51.837
LITTLE. COMFORTABLE FOR PEOPLE

02:01:51.904 --> 02:01:53.572
TO SAY WELL SIX YEARS IS OKAY

02:01:53.639 --> 02:01:56.809
OR MORE- BUT WE KNOW AS WE HEAR

02:01:56.876 --> 02:01:58.110
FROM THE SURVEY DATA THAT

02:01:58.177 --> 02:01:59.011
STUDENTS WANT TO GET THROUGH

02:01:59.078 --> 02:02:00.546
AND FOR THAT TRADITIONAL MODEL

02:02:00.613 --> 02:02:02.448
SOMETHING THAT WE WANT TO. RE

02:02:02.515 --> 02:02:05.317
ESTABLISH AND- MAKE IT BE THE

02:02:05.384 --> 02:02:08.254
NORM AGAIN- AS I SAID AT THE

02:02:08.320 --> 02:02:10.322
BEGINNING OF THE HEARING. TO

02:02:10.389 --> 02:02:11.691
ACHIEVE THE GOALS THAT THE

02:02:11.757 --> 02:02:14.393
SYSTEM HAS SET. 40% GRADUATION

02:02:14.460 --> 02:02:16.762
BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE IS THAT

02:02:16.829 --> 02:02:19.398
INCOMING CLASS IN LESS THAN

02:02:19.465 --> 02:02:20.032
TWELVE MONTHS THAT'S GOING TO

02:02:20.099 --> 02:02:21.701
DETERMINE OUR SUCCESS IN THAT

02:02:21.767 --> 02:02:23.836
REGARD. SO A LOT OF GOOD

02:02:23.903 --> 02:02:25.237
PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE WE'RE

02:02:25.304 --> 02:02:27.239
SEEING A LOT OF GOOD PROGRESS-

02:02:27.306 --> 02:02:29.575
IN TERMS OF THE- GRADUATION TO

02:02:29.642 --> 02:02:32.278
GET CLOSER TO THAT NUMBER- BUT

02:02:32.344 --> 02:02:33.312
WE DON'T HAVE TOO MUCH TIME

02:02:33.379 --> 02:02:35.614
LEFT TO. TO DO ALL THE THINGS

02:02:35.681 --> 02:02:38.017
THAT WE NEED TO DO. TO MAKE

02:02:38.084 --> 02:02:41.253
THAT GOAL ACHIEVABLE- AND SO.

02:02:41.320 --> 02:02:42.421
FOR THAT REASON I KNOW BY

02:02:42.488 --> 02:02:43.923
COLLEAGUES AND I ARE COMMITTED

02:02:43.989 --> 02:02:47.460
