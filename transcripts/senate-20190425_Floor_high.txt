MAJORITY LEADER HERTZBERG IS PREPARED TO PRESENT MISTER SECTOR CAN YOU PLEASE READ SENATE BILL THIRTY SIX BY SENATOR HERTZBERG AN ACT RULING TO PREACH ARE RELEASED GOOD MORNING MR MAJORITY LEADER THE FLOOR IS YOURS SIR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AS PRESIDENT. TO TOGETHER WITH SENATOR MITCHELL WE ARE JOINT AUTHORS OF THIS MEASURE. SB THIRTY SIX IS A BILL INSPIRED BY A NATIONAL MOVEMENT FOCUSED ON REFORMING OUR PRE TRIAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. CROSS THIS COUNTRY POLICY INNOVATORS IN SYSTEM ACTORS ARE RETHINKING HOW WE ACHIEVE EQUITY FOR THE ACCUSED IN THE PERIOD BETWEEN WHEN THEY ARE CHARGED WITH A CRIME. AND WHEN THEY ARE BROUGHT TO TRIAL. IN CALIFORNIA COUNTIES ALREADY HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTING SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THEIR PRE TRIAL. SYSTEMS FORTY NINE OF OUR FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES MISTER PRESIDENT. HAVE ADOPTED PRE TRIAL RISK ASSESSMENT TOOLS AIMED AT IMPROVING JUDICIAL DECISION MAKING IN PRE TRIAL SUPERVISION PRACTICES. THE PROBLEM OF COURSE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO WHICH WE ARE SEEKING TO TO REPAIR WITH THIS MEASURE. IS A THE TOOLS COME IN ALL SHAPES AND SIZES THEIR PRODUCE IN ALL MANNERS OF ORGANIZATIONS FROM FOR PROFIT COMPANIES TO CHARITABLE FOUNDATIONS AND THE VERY DRAMATICALLY IN THE METHODOLOGY THE USED TO CALCULATE. RISK OF SOMEONE CHARGED WITH A CRIME. MORE CONCERNING IS THE FACT THAT UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW OUR CURRENT LAW THERE ARE NO MINIMUM STANDARDS ARE REPEAT MEMBERS THERE ARE NO MINIMUM STANDARDS GOVERNING THE EFFECTIVE USE OF RISK ASSESSMENT TOOLS AND NO SAFEGUARDS. IN PLACE TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE BEING USED IN A WAY THAT ACCURATELY ESTIMATES THE RISK WHILE MINIMIZING BIAS. ARE STRESS MINIMIZING BIAS WITH THIS MEASURE WE ARE CREATING THREE MINIMUM STANDARDS REGARDING THE USE OF RISK ASSESSMENT TOOLS. ONE ANY COUNTY THAT USES A TOOL MUST VALIDATE THE TO ON A REGULAR BASIS THAT MEANS EVERY SIX MONTHS. TO ANY TOOL USED IN CALIFORNIA MUST BE TRANSPARENT. THAT MEANS IT COUNTIES NEED TO TELL THE PUBLIC EXACTLY HOW THE RISK CORES ARE BEING CALCULATED. THREE COUNTIES DE TO COLLECT RETAIN AND PUBLISH DATA ON THEIR PRE TRIAL RISK ASSESSMENT TOOLS SO THAT THEY CAN BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE TO THE COMMUNITIES. THAT THEY SERVE MEMBERS THE REALITY IS THAT IN CALIFORNIA WHEN IT COMES TO THE WAY WE HANDLE THE ACCUSED BEFORE TRIAL. WE ARE FAILING. AT NIGHT TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN REPORT BY THE PRE TRIAL JUSTICE IS TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE PRE TRIAL JUSTICE SYSTEMS IN ALL FIFTY STATES. MEMBERS. WE IN CALIFORNIA RECEIVED A D.. A DE. WE CAN DO BETTER WE MUST DO THE BALLOT. IN DEVELOPING THIS MEASURE WE HAVE WORKED CLOSELY WITH A GROUP OF SPONSORS THE ELLA BAKER CENTER OF CIVIL RIGHTS. CALIFORNIA'S FOR SAFETY AND JUSTICE THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY THE ANTI RECIDIVISM COALITION. NEXT GEN AMERICA S. CI YOU CALIFORNIA ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU CENTER HERTZBERG DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THE FLOOR OF SENATOR MITCHELL. FLOOR IS YOURS MA'AM. GOOD MORNING MR PRESIDENT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'D STOOD ON THE FLOOR AS WE DEBATED THE BAIL BILL LAST YEAR -- WHEN SOME FOLKS HAD SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THE FINAL VERSION OF THE BILL AND WHETHER OR NOT? IT WAS TIMELY WEATHER NOT IT WAS COOKED YET AND SAID THAT I WOULD STAND WITH MISTER HERTZBERG AGAIN. THIS YEAR TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GET IT RIGHT. AND I BELIEVE SB THIRTY SIX IS THE APPROPRIATE NEXT STEP IN GUARANTEEING THAT WE GET IT RIGHT. WE CAN DEBATE THE INHERENT BIAS OF RISK ASSESSMENT TOOLS FRANKLY UNTIL THE COWS COME HOME. BUT THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THAT ANY PREDICTIVE TOOL WE USE IN ANY PART OF OUR LIVES IS IN SOME WAY GOING TO USE THE PASS. TO SHED LIGHT ON THE FUTURE. THIS IS TRUE WHEN JUDGES LOOK AT RAPSHEETS TO MAKE A BILL DETERMINATION ARE WHEN ECONOMISTS LOOK AT BOOM AND BUST CYCLES TO TRY AND PREDICT THE NEXT RECESSION. WE HAVE A CHOICE WE CAN GIVE INTERFERE CENSORSHIP SYSTEM ACTORS OF A VALUABLE TOOL THAT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO PROTECT INDIVIDUAL LIBERTY. AND PUBLIC SAFETY OR WE CAN DO THE HARD WORK OF BUILDING IN SAFEGUARS TO MAKE SURE THIS TOOL IS USE THE RIGHT WAY. THERE'S THIS HOVERING FEAR OUT THERE ABOUT THE USE OF MACHINES AND YOU'LL READ IT FROM BOTH CRITICS. AND SUPPORTERS ON BOTH SIDES THAT IF WE ALLOW COURTS AND COUNTIES TO USE THESE TOOLS WILL BE LEADING MACHINES MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT OUR LIBERTY. THE CRITICS ARE WRONG. THESE MACHINES DO NOT MAKE RELEASE OR DEATH THE TENSION DECISIONS. RISK ASSESSMENT TOOLS ARE EXACTLY THAT THEY ARE TOOLS ADDING MORE TOOLS TO THE JUDGES TOOL BOX WILL ENHANCE THEIR DECISION MAKING. BROADEN THEIR UNDERSTANDING OF AN INDIVIDUAL CIRCUMSTANCES BY BRINGING DATA AND EVIDENCE INTO THE EQUATION FOR THOSE REASONS I PROBABLY STAND AS PRINCIPAL COOPER AND WILL BE VOTING TODAY TO SUPPORT.

MR SECTOR CAN YOU PLEASE READ SENATE BILL SIXTY FOUR BY SENATOR CHIANG AND ACT REALLY IN ANIMALS. GOOD MORNING SENATOR CHIANG. GOOD MORNING MISTER PRESIDENT AND COLLEAGUES SB SIXTY FOUR REQUIRES ALL MUNICIPAL ANIMAL SHELTERS AS SPECIFIED MICROCHIP. ANY DOG OR CAT WITH CURRENT INFORMATION THAT IS EITHER ADOPTED OR CLAIM BY A PET OWNER. THIS WILL ULTIMATELY SAVE CALIFORNIA TAXPAYER DOLLARS BY SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF EUTHANIZED. AND SHELTER DOGS AND CATS. SB SIXTY FOUR IS NEARLY IDENTICAL TO SB SEVEN OH TWO OF TWENTY ELEVEN THAT PASSED THROUGH WITH BIPARTISAN SUPPORT. OUT OF THE OVER SIX MILLION ANIMALS THAT ARE SHELTERED NATIONWIDE APPROXIMATELY ONE POINT FIVE MILLION SHELTER DOGS AND CATS LOSE THEIR LIVES EUTHANASIA. IN CALIFORNIA HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS SHELTER DOGS AND CATS ARE EUTHANIZED EVERY YEAR. A SIGNIFICANT SOURCE OF THE PROBLEM IS I AND WANT IDENTIFICATION AND THE ABILITY TO REUNITE THESE ANIMALS WITH THEIR FAMILIES. ONLY 15% OF DOGS AND 2% OF CATS IN SHELTERS WITHOUT IDENTIFICATION REUNIFIED WITH THEIR OWNERS. BY CONTRAST ACCORDING TO THE JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN VETERINARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION ALMOST 75%. OF LOS MICROCHIP CATS AND DOGS WERE LOCATED DUE TO THE PRESENCE OF THE MICROCHIP. FOR EXAMPLE DURING THE CAMP FIRE THE FIRE SPREAD SO FAST THAT PEOPLE BARELY HAD TIME TO SAVE THEMSELVES LET LET ALONE THERE PAT. AS A RESULT OVER THE FOLLOWING WEEKS FIRST RESPONDERS CARRY THOUSANDS OF INJURED AND DISPLACED ANIMALS EMERGENCY VETERINARY HOSPITALS. AND EMERGENCY ANIMAL SHELTERS IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE LOOKING ANIMALS AND ALREADY HAD THE MICROCHIP IN IMPLANTED WERE SAVED IN THAT WITHOUT MICHAEL TO FOR TAGS THE IDENTIFICATION PROCESS COULD HAVE BEEN DIFFICULT BECAUSE OF THE INJURY SUCH AS THE WHISKERS BEING SINGED OFF. OF YOURS PAINFULLY BURNED AT THE EDGES INFERS FOR WISHING FOR TREATMENT SO BASICALLY SOME OF THEM WERE UNRECOGNIZABLE. WITH THIS BILL WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US. TO TO BE ABLE TO SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF DOGS AND CATS THAT WIND UP IN SHELTERS TO BE EUTHANIZED. BOTTOM LINE WE ARE SAVING LIVES AND TAXPAYER DOLLARS WITH THIS BILL AND WITH THAT I WOULD LIKE TO RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MADAM SENATOR DO WE HAVE DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THE FLOOR SENATOR HUESO.

MEMBERS ARE NOW MOVING ON TO ITEM FIFTY FOUR SENATOR DODD IS PREPARED. MISTER SECRETARY CAN YOU PLEASE READ SENATE BILL ONE SIXTY SEVEN BY SENATOR DODD AN ACT RELATING TO ELECTRICITY. THE MORNING SENATOR DOT ELECTRICITY. YES -- MISTER PRESIDENT MEMBERS SP ONE SIXTY SEVEN ADDRESSES THE ISSUE OF HOW UTILITIES ASSIST CUSTOMERS PARTICULARLY LOW INCOME CUSTOMERS WHO RELY ON LIFE SUPPORT EQUIPMENT. WHEN THE UTILITY DE ENERGIZES POWER LINES TO PROTECT AGAINST WILDFIRE IGNITION? LAST YEAR'S ESPY NOT A ONE REQUIRES ELECTRIC UTILITIES TO PREPARE WILD FIRE MITIGATION PLANS THAT INCLUDE PROTOCOLS FOR DE ENERGIZING POWER LINES. IT IS LIKELY WITH CLIMATE CHANGE IN THE ESTABLISH MENTOR OF FORMAL PROTOCOLS TO DE ENERGIZED -- POWER LINES THE FREQUENCY OF POWER OUTAGES WILL CONTINUE TO GROW. DE ENERGIZING OF ELECTRICAL TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION EQUIPMENT CREATES CERTAIN RISKS OF ITS OWN AMONG THOSE RISK IS INTERRUPTION OF POWER NEEDED TO OPERATE -- CUSTOMER BASE LIFE SUPPORT EQUIPMENT. AMONG THOSE RISKS. EXCUSE ME -- MANY OF THESE CRITICAL CARE CUSTOMERS ARE LOW INCOME INTO OF ALREADY RECEIVE DISCOUNTS UNDER THE CALIFORNIA ALTERNATIVE RADIATOR G. CARE PROGRAM. I BELIEVE IT IS A MATTER OF HEALTH AND SAFETY TO ASSIST LOW INCOME CRITICAL CARE MEDICAL BASE LIKE CUSTOMERS IN THE PROVISION OF EMERGENCY BACKUP POWER. THEY CAN OPERATE LIFE SUPPORT EQUIPMENT FOR THE DURATION OF THE POWER OUTAGE. SB ONCE SIX SEVEN SIMPLY REQUIRES AN ELECTRICAL UTILITY TO DETERMINE HOW IT WANTS TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE AND DESCRIBE IT SOLUTION IN THAT PART OF ITS WILD FIRE MITIGATION PLAN. THE PER TEN PER PERTAINS TO ENERGIES ENERGY. ENERGY IS A SIN -- PROTOCOLS SO -- WITH THAT THERE'S NO OPPOSITION ON THE BILL AND A RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AYE. THANK YOU SENATOR DODD. SENATORS WILL DISCUSSION OR DEBATE WE DO HAVE A FEW WE'RE GONNA GO TO SENATOR STONE AND THEN SENATOR STERN. FINISHED ON THE FLOOR IS YOURS SIR.

SO THIS IS A VERY PROACTIVE BILL -- PARTNERING WITH THE UTILITIES TO IDENTIFY THOSE PEOPLE AT RISK AND ENSURE THAT IF WE HAVE SOME OF THE HORRIFIC -- DISASTROUS FIRES THAT WE'VE EXPERIENCED IN THE PAST SO WE WILL HAVE BACKUP GENERATORS OR SOME OTHER FORM OF ALTERNATIVE ENERGY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE SUSTAIN THEIR LIVES UNTIL SUCH TIME. THAT THE UTILITY. GUARANTEE THEM SAFE ELECTRIFICATION WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR AND URGED AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SO MUCH SIR CENTERS TURN THE FLOOR IS YOURS FAMOUS PRESENT I JUST WANT TO RISE BRIEFLY IN SUPPORT AND SAY THAT IS A CRITICAL FIRST STEP IN. PREVENTING THE IMPACTS OF P. S. P. S.

BUT WE FOUND THE THAT THERE'S A PROHIBITION FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF EYE GLASSES ONE CAN WEAR WHEN THEY DRIVE OR THE LIGHTING REQUIRED A NOW DEFUNCT WOULDN'T RIVER BARGES. BUT THE ONE THAT CAUGHT OUR ATTENTION IN THE ONE THAT I BRING TO YOU TODAY. IS REPEALING THE EIGHTEEN SEVENTY TWO LAW THE POSSE COMITATUS ACT OF EIGHTEEN SEVENTY TWO PENAL CODE SECTION ONE FIFTY MAKES IT A CRIME. LADIES AND GENTLEMAN FOR ANYONE OVER THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN IN THE CITY CALIFORNIA TO WILLFULLY OR NEGLIGENT REFUSED TO JOIN A POSSE. AND IMPOSE A FINE OF A THOUSAND DOLLARS AND WITH ASSESSMENTS AS WELL MORE LIKE THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS. NOW WE KNOW THAT THROUGHOUT OUR HISTORY WE'VE ADOPTED THE POSSE POWER IN THE EARLIEST DAYS OF OUR REPUBLIC. IN DECADES THAT FOLLOWED WAS MOST NOTABLY USED TO PRESERVE THE PEACE ON THE WESTERN FRONT. AND QUITE SURPRISINGLY IS WE REACHED WITH IT WENT THROUGH THE HISTORY TO APPREHEND SOLD RUN AWAY SLAVES. BUT A LOCAL GRANT OF POWER THAT MAY HAVE BEEN NECESSARY DURING A TIME OF LAWLESS FRONT TWO YEARS AND WHEN THE SOCIETY WAS QUITE DIFFERENT. WAS NOT SIMPLY RELEVANT TODAY IN MODERN TIMES. WE ARE PROFESSIONAL POOL POLICE FORCES THAT USE INCREDIBLE TECHNOLOGY INVESTIGATIVE MATH METHODOLOGIES TO SOLVE CRIMES WE DON'T NEED CRIMINAL LIABILITY HANGING OVER CITIZENS. HEADS TO COURSE THEM TO ASSISTING POLICE. AND I WANT TO MAKE 6 THING PERFECTLY CLEAR BY REMOVING THIS SECTION FROM THE PENAL CODE WE ARE NOT SAYING. THAT CALIFORNIANS SHOULD NOT HELP FIRST RESPONDERS AND THEIR FELLOW CITIZENS WHEN OBLIGATED BY EITHER STATUTORY OR MORAL DUTY WE HAVE A GOOD SAMARITAN LAW IN CALIFORNIA THE HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE. WE ARE PROVISIONS IN GOVERNMENT CODES AND PENAL CODES I DON'T DROOL THROUGH ALL OF THEM BUT THEY'RE PRETTY SIGNIFICANT. THE BOTTOM LINE OF WHICH IMPOSE ON A DUTY BUT NOT CRIMINAL LIABILITY. AND I MENTIONED ALSO THE FEES AND SO THE LAWS A VESTIGE OF A BY GONE ERA. AND WHAT INVOKE SUBJECTS CALIFORNIANS TO AN UNTENABLE MORAL DILEMMA. JOINT AND POTENTIALLY PUT ONE'S LIFE AT RISK OR REFUSE TO BECOME A CRIMINAL.

HOWEVER OUR RETAIL ELECTRICITY A MARKET PLACE IS FACING ENORMOUS CHANGES WE HAVE SEATED HERE ALMOST ON A DAILY BASIS OVER THE LAST NUMBER OF YEARS IN THIS LEGISLATURE. AND SO HAS OUR REGULATORY SYSTEM SUCH A EXPERIENCE SIMILAR BUT CHANGES. SO. ON OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS. SEVERAL LOCAL AREAS HAVE BEEN STRUGGLING TO HAVE SUFFICIENT RESOURCES UNDER CONTRACT RESULTING IN EXPENSIVE THE LAST MINUTE POWER PROCUREMENT RESOURCE ADEQUACY REQUIRES THAT. EVERYONE. UP PLAY THEIR PART IN THE REGULAR IN THE REGULATORY PROGRAM OF ELECTRICAL RELY ABILITY. ONE SOLUTION IDENTIFIED BY A NUMBER OF STAKEHOLDERS IS TO CONSIDER ESTABLISHING WHAT WAS KNOWN AS A CENTRAL PROCUREMENT ENTITY SUCH ENTITY WOULD COVER GAPS IN LONG TERM CONTRACTING IS TO ENSURE ACCESS. TO AFFORDABLE CAPITAL IN CONTRACTS ACROSS ALL MARKET PLAYERS WHETHER CCA'S DIRECT ACCESS OR CUSTOMERS OF LOTS OF BEHIND THE METER RESOURCES. A CENTRAL BUYER IS HISTORICALLY PROVEN APPROACH FOUND OTHER STATES TO COORDINATE COST EFFECTIVE ELECTRICAL PROCUREMENT. SB FIFTY PUTS THIS OPTION ON THE TABLE AND WILL HELP US MEET OUR OTHER STATE WIDE ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS SINCE SOME OF THE RESOURCES WE NEED -- SO LARGE NO SINGLE ENTITY CAN CONTRACT FOR THEM THE BILL WILL PROTECT RATE PAYERS THROUGH ECONOMIES OF SCALE AND BY AVOIDING EXPENSIVE NON MARKET BASED BACKSTOP PROCUREMENT.

SENATE BILL FIVE OH FIVE BY SENATOR UMBERG AND ACTUALLY TO ELECTIONS A DECLINING THERE'S THE RUSTIC FACT IMMEDIATELY. CENTER I'M BURKE THE FLOORS YOUR SIR THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT MEMBERS I'VE RECENTLY BEEN INFORMED THAN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY THERE'LL BE A PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. ALL OVER THE UNITED STATES INCLUDING HERE IN CALIFORNIA. I'VE ALSO BEEN INFORMED THAT THE SECRETARY OF STATE AT HIS OR HER OWN DISCRETION COULD DECIDE. WHAT CANDIDATES WILL APPEAR AS PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES ON THE BALLOT IT IS CURRENTLY SUBJECTIVE WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS THIS BILL ADD SOME OBJECTIVE CRITERIA A VERY LOW BAR? FOR PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES TO APPEAR ON THE BALLOT. BOB THIS VERY LOW BAR DOES REQUIRE THEM TO ACTUALLY FOR EXAMPLE BE A RECOGNIZE CANDIDATE BY EITHER BEING IN -- IT INDOORS CAM A BY **** ANOTHER STATE. OR BY HAVING A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF POLLING. OR FOR EXAMPLE -- BY OPENING A CAMPAIGN OFFICE HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IT IS A SIMPLE MEASURE THAT SIMPLY APPLIES OBJECTIVE CRITERIA TO APPEARING ON THE PRESIDENTIAL BALLOT. THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH AS TO SENATOR MEMBERS TO A DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THE FLOOR WE DO CENTER ALLEN GOOD MORNING. WELL I WANT -- TO MEMBERS I WANT TO THANK THE SENATOR FOR RAISING THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE I THINK IT REALLY DOES -- BRING UP THE EXTRAORDINARY SUBJECTIVITY THAT CURRENTLY EXISTS IN LAW WITH REGARD TO THE PLACEMENT. OF PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES ON THE BALLOT. I WILL SAY THAT -- I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT HIS WORK YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S WE'RE GETTING INTO THIS AREA OF LAW THAT WERE FAIR. AND ONE OF THE QUESTIONS -- THE THAT I'VE BEEN TALKING THE CENTRAL BUT ABOUT IS -- REMEMBER THIS IS THE ONLY TIME NOW WHEN CALIFORNIANS CAN ACTUALLY VOTE AND WILL ACTUALLY VOTE IN A CLOSE PRIMARY EVERY OTHER -- WE'VE UPENDED PRIMARIES WITH THE TOP TWO SYSTEM. BUT JUST FOR THE PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY ONLY -- THE THE THOSE ARE CLOSE PRIMARIES. NOW FOR THE DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS IT'S A IT'S A IT'S A YOU KNOW IT IT DID PRETTY CLEAR WHAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING THERE BIG NATIONAL CAMPAIGNS BUT REMEMBER OUR OUR FRIENDS FROM THE GREEN. OF PEACE AND FREEDOM LIBERTARIAN PARTIES ARE ALSO SELECTING THEIR PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEES AT THE SAME TIME. AND I THINK THAT THE COURT CONCERNED TO TO NEEDS TO BE HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE FAIR TO THEM AS THEY'RE GOING TO THE PROCESS SELECTING THEIR NOMINEES. SO ARE SO YOU KNOW IN THE IN THE BILL FOR EXAMPLE THERE'S A REQUIREMENT THAT THE CANDIDATE HAS TO HAVE. AT LEAST ONE PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN OFFICE IN CALIFORNIA I TO BE CONSIDERED UNDER THE UNDER UNDER THESE RULES AS I JUST REVIEW OF WITH THE PERMISSION OF THE OF THE CHAIR I'D LOVE. TO ASK A QUESTION OF THE AUTHOR. SONORA BURKE WOULD YOU ACCEPT A QUESTION FROM CENTER ALLEN I'D BE HAPPY TO ACCEPT THE QUESTION FROM SEVERAL OKAY AROUND CAN YOU PLEASE FOR C.. SO. YOU AND I TALKED ABOUT ON ON PAGE THREE FOR EXAMPLE THE BILL TALKS ABOUT -- ABOUT HOW CANDIDATE IN ORDER TO BE PLACED ON THE BALLOT BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE UNDER THIS BILL THEY WOULD HAVE TO HAVE. AT LEAST ONE PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN OFFICE IN CALIFORNIA IS IT YOUR INTENT THAT THEY COULD UTILIZE -- THE PARTY THEIR PARTIES CAN'T YOU KNOW -- OFFICES. FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS OF THIS LANGUAGE ON ON PAGE THREE THIS IS SECTION THE ONE HE WON I WOULD THAT BE SUFFICIENT UNDER YOUR UNDER YOUR VISION FOR THIS BILL -- TO MEET THE CRITERIA FOR AT LEAST ONE PRESENTS A CAMPING OUT IN CALIFORNIA SO FOR EXAMPLE LET'S SAY MINOR PARTY CANDIDATE DESIGNATED HIS OR HER. PARTY HEADQUARTERS AS THEIR HEADQUARTERS AS WELL THAT WOULD BE SUFFICIENT. OKAY -- I THINK THAT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL BECAUSE REMEMBER YOU'RE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT CAMPAIGNS THAT ARE MUCH SMALLER THAN THE THAN THE BIG NATIONAL CAMPAIGNS. THAT ARE PARTIES -- HALF OKAY THAT'S ONE THING -- I KNOW THAT YOU'RE DOING SOME ADDITIONAL WORK I KNOW YOU GOT SOME AMENDMENTS AYE AYE I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS I WILL ALSO. YOU YOU TOLD ME THAT -- UNDER CURRENT LAW. ANOTHER WAY THAT THAT THAT CANDIDATES COULD GET ON TO THE BALLOT. ASIDE FROM THIS PROCESS WOULD BE TO COLLECT SIGNATURES EQUIVALENT THE STATE WHICH I THINK FOR GREEN OR PIECE OF FREEDOM LIBERTARIANS IS LESS THAN A THOUSAND SIGNATURES SO THAT THAT WOULD BE ANOTHER AVENUE. FOR PEOPLE TO GET ON THE BALLOT BUT I I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE AS WE'RE MOVING FORWARD WE'RE ALL PART OF THE TWO BIG PARTIES AND AND WE'RE PROUD OF OUR PARTIES BUT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE'RE BEING FAIR. TO SOME OF THE SMALLER PARTIES AS WELL AND I I JUST WANT TO SAY I APPRECIATE YOUR WILLINGNESS AN OPENNESS TO TO WORK WITH -- WITH EVERYONE ON THIS. I CAN'T. WAIT I I'M SORRY CENTER BURKE SIT AROUND SAID IN A FORM OF A QUESTION THAT YOU'D LIKE THAT SENATOR TO BE ABLE TO DRESS YES IT IS THANK YOU SO MUCH AND THEN CENTER NUMBER -- THAT'S IF YOU DON'T MIND LET'S SEE IF WE HAVE ANYONE ELSE IN YOU CAN COVER THAT YOU'RE CLOSE IF WE HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS OF THAT WORKS FOR FOLKS. MEMBERS ARE THERE ANY ADDITIONAL. COMMENTS ARE DEBATE ON THE FLOOR. WE DO SENATOR JONES. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY PLEASE. PLEASE SAY GIVE US. TWENTY SECONDS. THE OUR ANALYSIS DOESN'T INDICATE ANYTHING ABOUT AMENDMENTS. AND I DON'T THINK THE THE PRISONER SAID ANYTHING ABOUT AMENDMENTS IN HIS OPENING. SO I'M JUST WONDERING -- HOW WE HAVE A BILL ON THE FLOOR THAT'S HAS AMENDMENTS? THANK YOU SO MUCH CENTER JONES. BEFORE WE EVER SEE GIVE US TWENTY SECONDS WE RIGHT BACK WITH YOU [inaudible] MEMBERS. COR INTERESSES SECTOR THE SENATE THERE ARE NO AMENDMENTS PENDING. THE LAST AMENDMENTS THAT WERE TAKEN IN THIS BILL WERE TAKEN ON MARCH TWENTY FIFTH THERE ARE NO WHEN THEY MEAN SPENDING ON THE FLOOR TODAY. I BELIEVE SENATOR ALLEN WAS SIMPLY ASKING THE QUESTION BUT THERE ARE NO AMENDMENTS PENDING ON THE FLOOR TODAY. CENTER JONES MISTER PRESIDENT THANK YOU QUESTION FOR THE AUTHOR. CENTER NUMBER WILL YOU ACCEPT A QUESTION FROM SENATOR JONES A MOST ASSUREDLY THINNER JONES CAN YOU PLEASE PROCEED YES THANK YOU COULD YOU PLEASE. THIS -- ANSWER TO THE QUESTION REGARDING AMENDMENTS ARE YOU. PLANNING ON TAKING AMENDMENTS IN THE ASSEMBLY AND IF SO CAN YOU ADDRESS THOSE TODAY AND GIVE US AN IDEA OF WHAT WE'RE EXPECTING THIS PRODUCT TO LOOK LIKE WHEN IT COMES BACK THANK YOU -- YES THANK YOU OF FOR THE IMPORTANT QUESTION IT AND MY COLLEAGUE FROM SANTA MONICA IS CORRECT HE AND I HAD DISCUSSED -- ADDITIONAL MEMBERS THE ADDITIONAL AMENDMENTS ANTICIPATED IN THE ASSEMBLY WOULD ACTUALLY LOWER THE BAR IN TERMS OF THE SORT OF THE THE FIVE CRITERIA ORIGINALLY IT SAYS YOU MUST BE TWO OF THE FIVE THE INTENDED AMENDMENT WOULD MEAN THAT YOU'D ONLY NEED TO BE ONE OF THOSE FIVE CRITERIA -- IN IN MY COLLEAGUE IS CORRECT. ALSO CALLER FROM CINEMA IS CORRECT THAT FOR EXAMPLE IF SOMEONE FOR WHATEVER REASON CAN'T MEET. THOSE RELATIVELY LOWER A LOWER THRESHOLD THEY ALSO COLLECT SIGNATURES AND FOR THE PEACE AND FREEDOM PARTY WOULD BE SEVEN SIXTY EIGHT SIGNATURES FOR THE NEXT -- PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY. THANK YOU SO MUCH CENTER UMBERG CENTER JONES IN YOUR OWN TIME WOULD YOU LIKE TO INCLUDE COMMENTS OR DO YOU HAVE ANOTHER QUESTION FOR THE GOOD CENTER NOT OVER AT MY AT MY OWN TIME THANK YOU PLEASE FOR SIDE. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT -- AND TO THE PRESENTER I WAS PREPARED TO SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY BUT SINCE IT SOUNDS LIKE IT'S NOT. FULLY DEVELOPED I'M GONNA LAY OFF TODAY AND ENCOURAGE MY COLLEAGUES TO EITHER VOTE NO OR LAY OFF UNTIL WE HAVE A FINAL PRODUCT THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH ENERGY OWNS. TO THIS BILL. YEAH MEMBERS ANY ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. CENTER ALLEN PLEASE FOR SEE YEAH I I JUST -- SINCE I WAS GOING TO OPEN THE PANDORA'S BOX HERE I I WOULD ENCOURAGE MY MY DEAR COLLEAGUE TO TO RECONSIDER HIS OPPOSITION -- THE REASON BEING IF IT DID THE THE THE THE BILL IS ESSENTIALLY GOING TO STAY THE SAME. LITERALLY ALL THEY WOULD BE DOING WOULD BE MAKE IT EASIER FOR BALLOT ACCESS RIGHT NOW IT'S A BIT OF A WILD WEST THE SECRETARY STATE IS GIVEN A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF DISCRETION. AS TO WHO GETS ON THE BALLOT AND IN FACT WITH THE SECTOR STATE ON THE AUTHOR TRYING TO DO IS PROVIDE FOR MORE CLARITY AND MORE -- MORE FAIRNESS THAT'S RIGHT IN BLACK AND WHITE FOR FOLKS TO KNOW HOW TO GET ON TO THE BALLOT OR NOT. THE ONLY CHANGE IT HE'S ANTICIPATING IT AS YOU HEARD WAS TO GO FROM HAVING TO BE TO THE CRITERIA DOWN TO ONE OF THE CRITERIA SO IT'S A VERY TRANSPARENT CHANGE THAT REALLY DOESN'T CHANGE THE SUBS OF THE BILL ALL IT DOES. IS MAKE IT. MAKE IT A LITTLE EASIER FOR CANDIDATES TO GET ON THE BALLOT IN A CLEAR AND TRANSPARENT WAY SO I I WITH RESPECT AYE AYE THE THE THE CHEESY HE'S ANTICIPATING HE JUST ARTICULATED IS NOT. SUBSTANTIVE TO SAY THAT THIS IS NOT A FULLY BATES BILL I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT WE THAT WE WERE ABLE TO HAVE AN OPEN DISCUSSION. ABOUT THE CORE PRINCIPLE THAT WILL BE GUARDED BY THIS BILL WHICH IS WHICH IS ACCESS CLARITY AND FAIRNESS FOR ALL PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES OF OF OF CERTAIN AMOUNT OF RIGOR -- FROM ALL THE PARTIES INCLUDING THE VERY SMALL ONES. AND WITH THAT I DO ENCOURAGE WITHIN WITH THE COMMITTEES MADE I REALLY WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO TO CONSIDER ARE SUPPORTING THIS BILL TODAY. THANK YOU SO MUCH CENTER ALLEN MEMBERS. WE'RE STILL HAVING DEBATE AND DISCUSSION ON THE FLOOR WE'RE GONNA TURN IT OVER TO SENATOR JONES IN SENATOR BATES CENTER JONES THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT AT AND I AGREE IN TRUSTS -- THE PRIOR PRISONER AND THE AUTHOR OF THE BILL I JUST BELIEVE IT SETS A SET A BAD PRECEDENT FOR THE SENATE TO BE PASSING BILLS OVER TO THE ASSEMBLY. AND TRUST THAT THEY'RE GOING TO COME BACK IN THE SAME MANNER THAT WE THINK THEY'RE GOING TO COME BACK AND AGAIN -- HOLD TO MY POSITION THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH CENTER JONES. GOOD MORNING SENATOR BATES. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT A QUESTION FOR THE AUTHOR I MIGHT. FEDERAL BURKE WOULD YOU ACCEPT A QUESTION FROM SENATOR BATES. CERTAINLY CENTER BASED CAN YOU PLEASE PROCEED -- ARE IS CALIFORNIA UNIQUE AND GIVING SUCH WIDE DISCRETION TO OUR SECRETARY OF STATE IN DETERMINING WHO MIGHT BE ON A PRESIDENTIAL BALLOT. THANK YOU SERVICE I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER THAT QUESTION -- BUT I DO KNOW IS THAT. CURRENTLY BECAUSE THE CRITERIA IS NOT OBJECTIVE IT IS SUBJECTIVE THAT THEORETICALLY THE SECRETARY OF STATE COULD DECIDE THAT THAT THE REPUBLICAN. NOMINEE FOR THE REPUBLICAN WHO IS MOST PROMIENT THE POLLS MIGHT NOT SHOW UP ON THE BALLOT NOW OF COURSE THAT PERSON WOULD SUE AND AND PROBABLY END UP BEING ON THE BALLOT BECAUSE THIS. CURRENT STANDARD IS RECOGNIZABLE THAT'S THE CURRENT STANDARD SO THIS SIMPLY CREATES OBJECTIVE CRITERIA. ALSO WITH RESPECT TO ANY MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY BILL CERTAINLY COME BACK TO THE SENATE. WE'LL ALL HAVE A CHANCE BOTH IN COMMITTEE AND ON THE FLOOR TO MAKE A DECISION AS TO WHETHER THOSE AMENDMENTS ARE ACCEPTABLE OR NOT SO IT IS NOT AS THOUGH. THIS IS NOT GONNA BE SEEN AGAIN SHOULD THERE BE AN AMENDMENT. THANK YOU ON MY OWN TIME I IN YOUR OWN TIME THAT -- THE THE GOOD SENATOR FROM ORANGE COUNTY IS PROCEEDING AND I THINK A VERY DELIBERATE WAY ON IT IS OF CONCERN THAT THE SECRETARY OF STATE WOULD HAVE THAT KIND OF DISCRETION THAT ACTUALLY COULD. I IN FACT -- DISCRIMINATE AGAINST A POTENTIAL CANDIDATE BECAUSE OF THE SUBJECTIVE REASONS SO WITHOUT I FEEL SUPPORTIVE BUT I THINK I WILL LAY OFF UNTIL IT RETURNS -- EUNICE FINAL FORM BUT I THINK YOU ARE HITTING THE ENDING IN A GOOD DIRECTION THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH CENTER BATES. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN OF THE SENATE. WOULD LIKE ME TO SEE IF THERE'S ANY ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THE FLOOR. LAST CALL DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. WE'D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO HAVE CENTER AMBERG PLEASE CLOSE AND IF THERE ARE ANY ADDITIONAL ITEMS THAT YOU'D LIKE TO BE ABLE. TO ADDRESS IN SEVEN ROUNDS ORIGINAL QUESTION THE FLOOR IS YOURS FOR THE CLOSER. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT MEMBERS -- THAT THE SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE NOW AND IT IS CRAZY IN A CREDIT TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE TO ASK US TO PROVIDE SOME OBJECTIVE CRITERIA. TO SIMPLY SAY NO TO SAY YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE GONNA LEAVE IT IS STATUS QUO WE'RE NOT GOING TO MOVE FORWARD. IS. TECHNICALLY NOT OF WHAT WE SHOULD DO IS WE SHOULD PASS THIS BILL -- IF THERE'S ANY ISSUE THAT SHOULD ARISE IT SHOULD CAUSE ANY CONSTERNATION IT WILL COME BACK. IN AT THAT POINT IN TIME IF THE MINORITY PARTY DECIDES THAT THEY WANT TO RAISE THE BAR. WE CAN HAVE THAT CONVERSATION BUT FOR NOW AND FOR TODAY I THINK WE SHOULD.

THANK YOU CENTER RUBIO CENTER LEYVA THE FLOOR IS YOURS GOOD MORNING THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT I RISE AS A CHAIR THAT WAS CAUCUS I RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS RESOLUTION I THINK THE AUTHOR FOR BRING IT FORWARD. SOME OF YOU HAVE PROBABLY HEARD ME SAY ONE OF THE THINGS I LOVE ABOUT THIS JOB IS YOU GET HERE AND YOU YOU GET TO FIX PROBLEMS. AND WHEN I FIRST HEARD THIS STORY IT WAS SHOCKING TO ME THAT A JUDGE WOULD ACTUALLY RULED THAT IT WAS THE WOMAN'S FAULT BECAUSE HER JEANS WERE TIGHT AND SHE MUST HAVE HELPED THE RAPIST. TAKE THEM OFF SO IT'S JUST SHOCKING -- WHEN MANY OF YOU ON THIS FLOOR VOTED TO ELIMINATE THE STATUTE OF LIMITATION -- ON RAPE I THANK YOU FOR THAT AND IF WE ALL STICK TOGETHER AND WE ALL WORK TOGETHER MAYBE ONE DAY WE WILL FINALLY END RATE. AND MAYBE ONE DAY WOMEN WILL BE RESPECTED AS THEY SHOULD BE SO THANK YOU SENATOR RUBIO AND THANK YOU ALL I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MADAM SENATOR ALSO CHAIR THE WOMEN'S CAUCUS WE'D LIKE TO BETTER TURNED OVER TO SENATOR JACKSON. GOOD MORNING MADAM CENTER THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER PRESIDENT COLLEAGUES I AM. I LOOK BACK AT MY EARLY CAREER WHICH FOR SOME WAS A LONG LONG TIME AGO AND THEY PROBABLY WEREN'T EVEN ALIVE YET -- AS A DEPUTY DA. BACK TRUST. A FEW DECADES AGO. A MAN COULD NOT RAPE HIS WIFE. THE LAW SPECIFICALLY SAID RAPE IS A CRIME COMMITTED AGAINST SOMEONE OTHER THAN YOUR WIFE. SO IT HASN'T BEEN THAT LONG. SINCE WE HAVE RECOGNIZED HOW SIGNIFICANT AND SERIOUS A CRIME RAPE AND SEXUAL ASSAULT. OUR IT IS THESE ARE CRIMES THAT ARE DESIGNED TO HUMILIATE. TO DEGRADE TWO SUBORDINATE TO SUBJUGATE WOMEN. AND SO I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS RESOLUTION BUT ALSO TO REMIND. OUR COLLEAGUES THAT. THE ATTITUDES ABOUT RAPE. HAVE CHANGED BUT NOT QUITE AS QUICKLY AS WE WOULD HOPE. AND SO WE HAVE TO ALSO CONSIDER THE FACT THAT. RAPE AND SEXUAL ASSAULT ARE CRIMES. THAT A REPORTED ONLY ABOUT 23% OF THE TIME. WHY BECAUSE WOMEN ARE AFRAID OF BEING ACCUSED AGAIN THE FAULT LAY WITH THE WOMAN WHO WAS WEARING BLUE JEANS? WE NOW HAVE MOVEMENT MOVEMENTS ARE OF HEAD MOVEMENTS LIKE TAKE BACK THE NIGHT. BECAUSE WOMEN ARE AFRAID OFTEN TO GO OUT IN THE EVENING AND IF THEY ARE IF THEY DO AND THEY WERE ASSAULTED. IT IS THEIR FAULT. AND SO WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE IT AS MUCH AS WE SYMBOLICALLY WEAR JEANS ONE DAY A YEAR. THIS IS A CULTURAL PROBLEM. AND WE MUST SHIFT THAT CULTURE IN OUR SOCIETY WE MUST DO IT WITH OUR BROTHERS AND SISTERS WE MUST DO IT WITH OUR CHILDREN. WE MUST MAKE SURE THAT AS WE MOVE IN THE FUTURE. THIS IS THE KIND OF BEHAVIOR THAT SOCIETY MAKES VERY CLEAR IT WILL NOT ACCEPT UNDER ANY CONDITIONS AND SO IT IS IMPORTANT FOR US TO RECOGNIZE. THE THE EVENT ITS IMPACT ON THE WOMEN WHO ARE VICTIMIZED OR OTHERS WHO ARE RAPED WE KNOW THAT WOMEN ARE NOT. EXCLUSIVELY THE VICTIMS OF THIS KIND OF HUMILIATION AND SUBJUGATION AND VIOLENCE BUT WE MUST AS A SOCIETY AND AS A LEGISLATURE BE AWARE OFF AND CONCERNED ABOUT AND TAKE ACTION. BASED UPON THE REALITIES THAT THIS IS NOT A CRIME. OF SEX THIS IS A CRIME OF VIOLENCE. AND THIS IS A CRIME OF HUMILIATION AND SUBJUGATION AND SO WHAT MANY OF US WARD CHANGE YESTERDAY. CHANGE OR FUND WHERE. BUT THIS IS A SERIOUS ISSUE AND WE HAVE TO REMEMBER GOING FORWARD THAT THIS BEHAVIOR HAS GOT TO BE STOPPED AND WE ARE IN A POSITION AS POLICY MAKERS TO ASSIST IN THAT EFFORT AND WITH THAT I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SO MUCHSENATE JACKSON MEMBERS WE LIKE TO BE ABLE TO TURN THE FLOOR OVER TO SENATOR SKINNER AND WE LIKE TO RECOGNIZE SENATOR STONE. THE MORNING. THANK YOU -- MISTER PRESIDENT MEMBERS I ALSO STAND IN SUPPORT OF THIS RESOLUTION AND I THANK MY COLLEAGUES FOR SPEAKING TO AND I APPRECIATE THAT -- OR SENATOR FROM SANTA BARBARA REFERENCED THAT IT IS NOT ONLY WOMEN WHO ARE SUBJECT TO THIS CRIME. AND I THINK THAT WE IN A FUNNY WAY THE CHOICES OF WORDS WE USE -- THEY HAVE A FACTOR IN OUR LOOKING AT THIS CRIME AND BY CALLING IT SEXUAL ASSAULT WELL THAT IS ACCURATE. IT IS IT IT IS VIOLENCE AND IT IS SUBJUGATION. AND IN FACT -- MEN. AND TRANSGENDERED PEOPLE ARE SUBJECT TO THIS CRIME IN GREAT NUMBERS AND REPORT AT EVEN A LOWER PERCENTAGE THAN WOMEN DO SO WHILE WE KNOW THAT THE VERY REPORT OF RAPE AND SEXUAL ASSAULT. IS LOW AND LOW FOR WOMEN IT IS EVEN LOWER FOR MEN AND TRANSGENDER PEOPLE WHY BECAUSE OF THE SHAME. AROUND SUCH A CRIME BECAUSE OF THE FEAR THAT YOU BE CONSIDERED THAT IT YOU ASKED FOR IT FOR IT IS YOUR FAULT OR THAT YOU WOULD NOT BE BELIEVED. SO I THINK IT IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR US TO LOOK AT THIS THROUGH A GENDER NEUTRAL LANDS AND TO LOOK AT IT FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE VIOLENCE AND THE SUBJUGATION. THAT SUCH A CRIME IS REALLY ABOUT AND WITH THAT I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU CENTER SKINNER. IT'S TURN THE FLOOR OVER TO SENATOR STONE GOOD MORNING. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR -- I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE THE SENATOR FROM BALDWIN PARK FOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. YOU KNOW THIS PAST WEEK -- THOSE OF THE JEWISH FAITH INCLUDING MYSELF CELEBRATED PASSOVER AND MY KIDS WERE YOUNG. AND COMING TO THE TABLE HUNGRY. WE WOULD HAVE TO READ THE HOT I'D TELL THE STORY ABOUT HOW THE THE JEWS -- LEFT BONDAGE IN EGYPT TO ISRAEL AND I REMEMBER ONE OF MY KIDS AT A ON THAT WHY CAN'T WE JUST GET TO THE MATZAH BALL SOUP IN THE CA FELT THE FISH WHETHER WE HAVE TO GO THROUGH THIS LONG STORY ALL OVER I'M HUNGRY. AND I SAID AS WE CAN WE HAVE TO REMEMBER WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THE STRUGGLES AND WHY -- WE CHERISH OUR FREEDOMS AND IN OUR LIBERTIES. WHEN I FIRST CAME TO THE LEGISLATURE IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN IS WHEN I FIRST LEARNED ABOUT THE SIGNIFICANCE OF DENIM I THINK WAS? THE SENATOR FROM SANTA BARBARA THAT EDUCATED ME ABOUT THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THAT AND IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT STORY CONTINUE TO BE TOLD AND I SUPPORTED IT EVERY YEAR THAT I'VE BEEN IN THE LEGISLATURE. AND IT'S GREAT FOR THE NEW MEMBERS TO HEAR THAT STORY BECAUSE WE NEED TO PERPETUATE THE MEMORY AS TO WHY WE CELEBRATE. IT THE THE THE THE OCCASION WAS WEARING DOWN WHICH I PROBABLY -- DID YESTERDAY I WAS ALSO GOING TO MENTION THIS IS NOT A CRIME OF JUST -- OF WOMEN IS A CRIME THAT -- MEN INDOOR TRANSGENDER PEOPLE INDOOR AS WELL. AND ALSO WHEN I WAS ON THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY I LEARNED IT OUR SEXUAL ASSAULT RESPONSE TEAM. WAS NOT FUNCTIONING WHICH MEANT THAT. MEN AND WOMEN OF SEXUAL ASSAULT COULDN'T COME INTO OUR COUNTY HOSPITAL. WITH TRAINERS PRACTITIONERS TO GATHER THE EVIDENCE SO THAT WE COULD PROSECUTE THAT 20% OR 30% OF PEOPLE THAT. WANT TO GO AFTER THE PERPETRATORS OF THE CRIMES WERE HAPPY. TO WHEN I FIRST -- ROLLS ON THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS AT THE FUND THAT PROGRAM NOT VERY PROUD TO SAY THAT PROGRAM REMAINS FUNDED TODAY AND THAT. WE HAVE BETWEEN THIRTY AND SIXTY CASES EVERY SINGLE MONTH. THAT WE ARE ABLE TO GIVE THAT EVIDENCE TO THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY SO HE CAN PROSECUTE THESE VERY HEINOUS CRIMES. SO MY FRIENDS I ENCOURAGE YOU TO SUPPORT THIS RESOLUTION -- I AM VERY. EXCITED TODAY BECAUSE I HAVE ONE DAUGHTER. AND MY GOAL WAS ALWAYS RAISE MY DAUGHTER IN A SAFER ENVIRONMENT THAT I GREW UP. MY DAUGHTER IS A LABOR WITH HER TWIN GIRLS TODAY IN HONOR MY TWIN GIRLS THAT ARE GOING TO BE COMING THIS AFTERNOON I HOPE. I WANT TO SHOULD I WANT HER TO REMEMBER THEIR GRANDFATHER STOOD UP TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAD A SAFER. COMMUNITY THAT RECOGNIZE THE HEINOUS CRIMES OF SEXUAL ASSAULT.
