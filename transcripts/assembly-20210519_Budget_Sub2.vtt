00:42:59.243 --> 00:43:01.145
THROUGH THE UC PACKAGE WE THINK

00:43:01.211 --> 00:43:02.313
THAT THEY'RE A MIX OF THOSE

00:43:02.379 --> 00:43:05.082
EXACT KIND OF PROPOSALS-

00:43:05.149 --> 00:43:07.151
INTERVIEW SHE ITEM HERE- FOR

00:43:07.217 --> 00:43:08.452
THE SAKE OF TIME I'M GOING TO

00:43:08.519 --> 00:43:10.187
FOCUS MY COMMENTS ON FOUR KEY

00:43:10.254 --> 00:43:14.158
ISSUES. I DON'T GO IN ORDER AS

00:43:14.224 --> 00:43:16.694
YOU SEE THEM HERE ON THE AGENDA.

00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:18.395
SORTING ON PAGE THREE OF THE

00:43:18.462 --> 00:43:19.964
FIRST ISSUE I WANT TO TOUCH ON

00:43:20.030 --> 00:43:21.699
IS BASE SUPPORT FOR THE

00:43:21.765 --> 00:43:23.600
UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA AGAIN AS

00:43:23.667 --> 00:43:25.436
THE ADMINISTRATION NOTED THERE

00:43:25.502 --> 00:43:26.770
ARE THEY ARE PROPOSING TO

00:43:26.837 --> 00:43:28.072
PROVIDE AN ADDITIONAL 2% BASED

00:43:28.138 --> 00:43:30.207
INCREASED YOU SEE LIKE IT'S

00:43:30.274 --> 00:43:31.241
THEIR TOTAL BASE INCREASE TO

00:43:31.308 --> 00:43:32.776
FIVE PERCENT. AND THAT'S ON TOP

00:43:32.843 --> 00:43:34.378
OF RESTORATION FUNDS THAT WOULD

00:43:34.445 --> 00:43:38.315
BE PROVIDED TO YOU SEE. I'M

00:43:38.382 --> 00:43:39.516
UNDER THE FEBRUARY GREEN ONES.

00:43:39.583 --> 00:43:39.984
OVERALL WE THINK IT'S

00:43:40.050 --> 00:43:42.086
REASONABLE THAT THE LEGISLATURE

00:43:42.152 --> 00:43:44.154
TO PROVIDE. ON SOME BASIS

00:43:44.221 --> 00:43:45.556
ADDITIONAL BASE SUPPORT YOU SEE

00:43:45.622 --> 00:43:47.324
ABOVE RESTORATION. YOU SEE

00:43:47.391 --> 00:43:48.959
FACES COST PRESSURES EVER YOU

00:43:49.026 --> 00:43:50.361
HEARD THIS YOU'RE CERTAINLY A

00:43:50.427 --> 00:43:52.229
DIFFERENCE- IN TERMS OF

00:43:52.296 --> 00:43:53.097
THINKING ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF

00:43:53.163 --> 00:43:54.365
THE SUPPORT WE THINK A

00:43:54.431 --> 00:43:56.367
REASONABLE STARTING POINT. A

00:43:56.433 --> 00:43:57.868
COULD BE SEVENTY SIX MILLION

00:43:57.935 --> 00:44:00.504
DOLLARS THAT'S- A LITTLE OVER

00:44:00.571 --> 00:44:03.607
TWO PERCENT. WOULD COVER OF THE

00:44:03.674 --> 00:44:04.975
SORT OF BASIC ESSENTIALS IT

00:44:05.042 --> 00:44:06.910
WOULD COVER- PLATE THAT EFFECT

00:44:06.977 --> 00:44:10.881
COST INCREASES. DEBT SERVICE

00:44:10.948 --> 00:44:12.182
FOR EXAMPLE. ON THE LEGISLATURE

00:44:12.249 --> 00:44:13.350
COULD CAN PROVIDE. FUNDING

00:44:13.417 --> 00:44:15.452
ABOVE THAT- FOR EXAMPLE BY

00:44:15.519 --> 00:44:17.688
ADOPTING THE PROPOSED 3% FROM

00:44:17.755 --> 00:44:20.858
JANUARY OR 5% OF THE REVISION.

00:44:20.924 --> 00:44:22.026
PROVIDING A LARGER BASE

00:44:22.092 --> 00:44:23.193
INCREASE WITH ANOTHER YOU SEE

00:44:23.260 --> 00:44:25.295
PRIORITIES FOR EXAMPLE EMPLOYEE

00:44:25.362 --> 00:44:28.165
SALARY INCREASES- IT WOULD

00:44:28.232 --> 00:44:30.300
ENHANCE STUDENT SERVICES. ABOUT

00:44:30.367 --> 00:44:31.368
THE UNIVERSITY WOULD HAVE

00:44:31.435 --> 00:44:32.403
FLEXIBILITY TO WEIGH THOSE

00:44:32.469 --> 00:44:34.972
PRIORITIES SO IF THERE ARE ANY

00:44:35.039 --> 00:44:35.506
PARTICULAR PRIORITIES THE

00:44:35.572 --> 00:44:37.274
LEGISLATURE. I WANT TO ENSURE

00:44:37.341 --> 00:44:40.611
YOU SEE SUPPORTING IT WE

00:44:40.677 --> 00:44:41.211
RECOMMEND SPECIFYING THAT THE

00:44:41.278 --> 00:44:43.914
BUDGET ACT. SURE WANT TO TOUCH

00:44:43.981 --> 00:44:45.516
ON IS THAT SECOND ISSUE THAT'S

00:44:45.582 --> 00:44:48.419
ON PAGE THREE WHICH IS LEARNING

00:44:48.485 --> 00:44:50.020
ALIGNED STUDENT FINANCE. ARE WE

00:44:50.087 --> 00:44:51.088
HAVE A NUMBER OF CONCERNS OF

00:44:51.155 --> 00:44:53.223
THIS PROPOSAL- ONE CONCERN WE

00:44:53.290 --> 00:44:54.691
HAVE IS WITH THE PROPOSED

00:44:54.758 --> 00:44:56.693
FUNDING APPROACH. WHICH WERE

00:44:56.760 --> 00:45:00.364
INVEST THE PROPOSED FUNDS- ANY

00:45:00.431 --> 00:45:02.032
USING DOMINANCE. ANNADEL

00:45:02.099 --> 00:45:04.101
MONTHS- INVEST FUNDS IN A

00:45:04.168 --> 00:45:06.103
VARIETY OF DIFFERENT ASSETS

00:45:06.170 --> 00:45:09.173
INCLUDING EQUITIES. THAT MAKES

00:45:09.239 --> 00:45:10.474
THEM SUBJECT TO MORE RISK AND

00:45:10.541 --> 00:45:11.842
MORE VOLATILITY OUR

00:45:11.909 --> 00:45:13.310
UNDERSTANDING IS THE PROPOSAL

00:45:13.377 --> 00:45:15.546
WOULD- FUNDED THESE NEW STUDENT

00:45:15.612 --> 00:45:17.448
EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES. ARE

00:45:17.514 --> 00:45:19.616
FROM THE ON GOING PROCEEDS FROM

00:45:19.683 --> 00:45:21.351
THESE INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES.

00:45:21.418 --> 00:45:24.254
AND AS SUCH MAY BE SUBJECT TO

00:45:24.321 --> 00:45:25.823
SOME VOLATILITY. WE THINK THAT

00:45:25.889 --> 00:45:26.824
WOULD MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR

00:45:26.890 --> 00:45:28.826
BOTH CAMPUSES AND STUDENTS THE

00:45:28.892 --> 00:45:31.628
PLAN FOR THE UPCOMING YEAR. THE

00:45:31.695 --> 00:45:32.563
PROPOSAL ALSO RAISES A NUMBER

00:45:32.629 --> 00:45:34.431
OF OUR KEY QUESTIONS FOR

00:45:34.498 --> 00:45:36.100
EXAMPLE WHAT THE ROLE WOULD BE

00:45:36.166 --> 00:45:38.702
OF EMPLOYERS AND SUPPORTING

00:45:38.769 --> 00:45:39.203
THESE OPPOSITION ROBERT

00:45:39.269 --> 00:45:43.006
KENNEDY'S- ALONG WITH THE STATE.

00:45:43.073 --> 00:45:44.007
BECAUSE THESE QUESTIONS ARE SO

00:45:44.074 --> 00:45:45.309
FUNDAMENTAL IN THIS PROPOSALS

00:45:45.375 --> 00:45:48.145
COMING- SO LATE IN THE PROCESS

00:45:48.212 --> 00:45:48.712
WE RECOMMEND REJECTING THIS

00:45:48.779 --> 00:45:52.449
PROPOSAL. SURE I WANTEDTO

00:45:52.516 --> 00:45:54.318
TOUCH ON ARE THESE MANY OTHER

00:45:54.384 --> 00:45:55.953
ONE TIME PROPOSALS THAT UC'S

00:45:56.019 --> 00:45:57.654
STARTING ON PAGE THREE AND

00:45:57.721 --> 00:45:59.656
CONTINUING ON THE PAGE FOR. ALL

00:45:59.723 --> 00:46:01.091
THE ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING

00:46:01.158 --> 00:46:02.392
TO FIND- MANY DIFFERENT

00:46:02.459 --> 00:46:04.561
PRIORITIES ARE FOR EXAMPLE

00:46:04.628 --> 00:46:06.263
DEFERRED MAINTENANCE. OUR

00:46:06.330 --> 00:46:09.933
RESEARCH ON- NEW WAYS TO ENGAGE

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:11.168
AT FIRST DIDN'T HAVE MIGHT HAVE

00:46:11.235 --> 00:46:13.170
THE SPECS YEAH. OUR RESEARCH ON

00:46:13.237 --> 00:46:16.707
ALTERNATIVE NEEDS OUTRAGED

00:46:16.773 --> 00:46:18.775
ANIMAL SHELTERS. THE

00:46:18.842 --> 00:46:20.777
RESTRICTIONS ARE PRO- IN ALLOWS

00:46:20.844 --> 00:46:22.112
STATE TO COVER MANY DIFFERENT

00:46:22.179 --> 00:46:24.248
PRIORITIES. BUT ALSO SPREAD

00:46:24.314 --> 00:46:25.849
RESOURCES THIN ACROSS ALL THE

00:46:25.916 --> 00:46:27.484
DIFFERENT PRIORITIES AND

00:46:27.551 --> 00:46:28.585
POTENTIALLY UNDERMINES THE

00:46:28.652 --> 00:46:30.687
STATE'S ABILITY TO ADEQUATELY

00:46:30.754 --> 00:46:32.556
ADDRESS ANY OF THEM. I DON'T

00:46:32.623 --> 00:46:33.790
ALTERNATIVE APPROACH

00:46:33.857 --> 00:46:35.792
LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER HERE

00:46:35.859 --> 00:46:38.428
IS TO BE MORE STRATEGIC AND

00:46:38.495 --> 00:46:39.930
FOCUS ON A FEW KEY PRIORITIES

00:46:39.997 --> 00:46:41.932
PARTICULARLY PRIORITIES THAT

00:46:41.999 --> 00:46:45.903
HAVE A CERTAIN- STATE BENEFITS.

00:46:45.969 --> 00:46:47.004
OF FOR EXAMPLE AND YOU'VE

00:46:47.070 --> 00:46:49.106
YOU'VE HEARD US MENTION THIS A

00:46:49.173 --> 00:46:50.807
LOT SO I WON'T- WHAT KIND OF

00:46:50.874 --> 00:46:52.976
THIS TOO MUCH BUT WE THINK

00:46:53.043 --> 00:46:53.810
DEFERRED MAINTENANCE IS A

00:46:53.877 --> 00:46:55.379
REALLY GOOD EXAMPLE OF A OF A

00:46:55.445 --> 00:46:57.648
PRIORITY THAT PROVIDES CERTAIN

00:46:57.714 --> 00:47:00.217
BENEFITS TO THE STATE. IT AND

00:47:00.284 --> 00:47:01.952
COVERS PROJECTS THAT WITH

00:47:02.019 --> 00:47:03.287
INCREASING COSTS IN FUTURE

00:47:03.353 --> 00:47:05.189
YEARS HELPS ADDRESS A BUDGET

00:47:05.255 --> 00:47:08.058
RESILIENCY FOR BOTH YOU SEE AND

00:47:08.125 --> 00:47:10.627
THE STATE'S. AND IN THE FINAL

00:47:10.694 --> 00:47:12.863
PROPOSAL I WANT TO TOUCH ON IS

00:47:12.930 --> 00:47:14.264
OUR LOW SECOND THE LAST ONE

00:47:14.331 --> 00:47:16.767
THERE ON PAGE FOUR WHICH IS FOR

00:47:16.833 --> 00:47:17.334
OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT LINE

00:47:17.401 --> 00:47:19.870
ITEM. NOW YOU SEE- HISTORICALLY

00:47:19.937 --> 00:47:21.638
HAS HAD THE ABILITY TO FIND THE

00:47:21.705 --> 00:47:24.408
OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT. ALL

00:47:24.474 --> 00:47:25.475
BUT A FEW YEARS AGO THE STATE

00:47:25.542 --> 00:47:27.177
CREATED A LINE ITEM

00:47:27.244 --> 00:47:28.545
SPECIFICALLY FOR THE OFFICE OF

00:47:28.612 --> 00:47:30.480
PRESIDENT WITH THE INTENTION OF

00:47:30.547 --> 00:47:33.283
ENHANCING OVERSIGHT OVER THE

00:47:33.350 --> 00:47:33.817
OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT'S

00:47:33.884 --> 00:47:37.854
BUDGET AND ALSO- INSERTING MORE

00:47:37.921 --> 00:47:39.756
CONTROL OVER ITS OPERATIONS.

00:47:39.823 --> 00:47:41.625
THE ADMINISTRATION IS NOW

00:47:41.692 --> 00:47:42.926
PROPOSING TO RETURN TO THAT

00:47:42.993 --> 00:47:44.394
PREVIOUS SYSTEM AND GIVING YOU

00:47:44.461 --> 00:47:46.230
SEE MORE FLEXIBILITY TO

00:47:46.296 --> 00:47:50.434
ALLOCATE RESOURCES. WE ARE

00:47:50.500 --> 00:47:51.568
CERTAIN ADVANTAGES TO

00:47:51.635 --> 00:47:53.770
PRESERVING THE LINE ITEM OF FOR

00:47:53.837 --> 00:47:55.005
WHEN WE THINK IT MAKES SENSE TO

00:47:55.072 --> 00:47:56.206
TARGET FUNDING DIFFERENTLY TO

00:47:56.273 --> 00:47:57.241
CAMPUS IT WAS WORTH AS THE

00:47:57.307 --> 00:47:58.909
OFFICE OF PRESIDENT. THERE ARE

00:47:58.976 --> 00:48:00.944
SOME COST PRESSURES THAT ARE

00:48:01.011 --> 00:48:02.412
SHARED BOTH BY THE OFFICE OF

00:48:02.479 --> 00:48:04.281
THE PRESIDENT IN CAMPUSES FOR

00:48:04.348 --> 00:48:06.116
EXAMPLE COMPENSATION INCREASES.

00:48:06.183 --> 00:48:06.984
BUT THERE ALSO ARE SOME

00:48:07.050 --> 00:48:08.085
DIFFERENT COST PRESSURES FOR

00:48:08.151 --> 00:48:09.486
EXAMPLE ENROLLMENT GROWTH

00:48:09.553 --> 00:48:11.321
STUDENT SERVICES THESE TEND TO

00:48:11.388 --> 00:48:13.423
BE MORE CONCENTRATED ON THE

00:48:13.490 --> 00:48:16.260
CAMPUSES. WE ALSO THINK IT ARE

00:48:16.326 --> 00:48:17.261
PRESERVING THE LINE ITEM

00:48:17.327 --> 00:48:18.662
ENHANCES TRANSPARENCY THAT WE

00:48:18.729 --> 00:48:20.063
RECOGNIZE THAT THE

00:48:20.130 --> 00:48:21.932
ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING.

00:48:21.999 --> 00:48:23.667
ADDITIONAL REPORTING WE THINK

00:48:23.734 --> 00:48:25.769
THAT RECORDING MAKES SENSE WE

00:48:25.836 --> 00:48:28.038
RECOMMEND YOU ADOPT THE REPORTS.

00:48:28.105 --> 00:48:29.573
FOR IT LINE ITEM OF PRESERVES

00:48:29.640 --> 00:48:32.309
EVEN ADDITIONAL. AND THAT IT

00:48:32.376 --> 00:48:33.844
CLARIFIES THE AMOUNT OF STATE

00:48:33.910 --> 00:48:36.980
THAT'S GOING FOR THIS PARTIES.

00:48:37.047 --> 00:48:38.348
SO WE DON'T RECKON AGAINST

00:48:38.415 --> 00:48:39.650
ELIMINATING A LINE ITEM WOULD

00:48:39.716 --> 00:48:41.518
YOU RECOMMEND ONE MODIFICATION

00:48:41.585 --> 00:48:43.120
WHICH IS THAT IN THE LINE ITEM

00:48:43.186 --> 00:48:44.521
THERE IS A CENTRAL

00:48:44.588 --> 00:48:45.722
ADMINISTRATIVE PROGRAM LOOK FOR

00:48:45.789 --> 00:48:47.391
JOBS YOU SEE CALF IT'S A

00:48:47.457 --> 00:48:48.558
PROGRAM THAT'S BEEN HURT BY

00:48:48.625 --> 00:48:51.328
THIS COMMITTEE BEFORE. EACH

00:48:51.395 --> 00:48:52.696
PARTICULAR PROGRAM WE THINK

00:48:52.763 --> 00:48:54.531
THAT IT WOULD MAKE SENSE TO

00:48:54.598 --> 00:48:55.265
RETURN THE FUNDS OF THE

00:48:55.332 --> 00:48:57.034
CAMPUSES AND HAVE A PROGRAM

00:48:57.100 --> 00:48:58.969
SUPPORTED BY A ON ASSESSMENT A

00:48:59.036 --> 00:49:00.937
CHARGE ON THE CAMPUSES. WE

00:49:01.004 --> 00:49:01.705
THINK THAT WOULD LEND IT

00:49:01.772 --> 00:49:04.908
STARTED GREATER EFFECTIVENESS

00:49:04.975 --> 00:49:06.443
AND EFFICIENCY OF THE PROGRAM-

00:49:06.510 --> 00:49:08.011
OF TIME ALL MY COMMENTS THERE

00:49:08.078 --> 00:49:09.513
BUT I HAPPY TO ELABORATE ON

00:49:09.579 --> 00:49:10.947
THESE ISSUES DURING THE- DAY.

00:49:11.014 --> 00:49:12.916

01:04:11.414 --> 01:04:13.816
HAVE A CLEAR CUT. ENROLLMENT

01:04:13.883 --> 01:04:16.252
TARGET WITH EXISTING MONEY I

01:04:16.319 --> 01:04:17.186
KNOW YOU ALWAYS WANT MORE AND

01:04:17.253 --> 01:04:19.055
MORE AND MORE BUT THESE ARE

01:04:19.121 --> 01:04:20.590
THESE ARE THE PRIORITIES OF THE

01:04:20.656 --> 01:04:22.758
PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA THESE ARE.

01:04:22.825 --> 01:04:23.926
THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA

01:04:23.993 --> 01:04:26.229
PRIORITIES- AT THE OFFICE OF

01:04:26.295 --> 01:04:28.030
THE PRESIDENT IVORY TOWER BUT

01:04:28.097 --> 01:04:29.999
DON'T REFLECT OUR CONSTITUENTS

01:04:30.066 --> 01:04:36.839
VALUES. RESPONSE. I THINK THAT

01:04:36.906 --> 01:04:38.307
OUR STUDENTS WOULD WANT THE

01:04:38.374 --> 01:04:39.842
UNIVERSITY TO HAVE HIGH QUALITY

01:04:39.909 --> 01:04:42.612
AND AS OF THE THIRD LARGEST

01:04:42.678 --> 01:04:44.113
EMPLOYER IN THE STATE IT IS

01:04:44.180 --> 01:04:46.515
IMPORTANT THAT WE HELP OUR

01:04:46.582 --> 01:04:49.318
STAFF SALARIES KEEP UP WITH

01:04:49.385 --> 01:04:52.822
INFLATION SO I THINK THE

01:04:52.888 --> 01:04:54.624
INTEREST OF THE UNIVERSITY AND

01:04:54.690 --> 01:04:56.292
THE STATE ARE VERY MUCH ALIGNED

01:04:56.359 --> 01:04:57.927
AND MAKING CERTAIN THAT THE

01:04:57.994 --> 01:05:00.196
BASE BUDGET OF THE UNIVERSITY'S

01:05:00.263 --> 01:05:03.266
HEALTHY. WE CAN INCREASE

01:05:03.332 --> 01:05:06.002
ENROLLMENT FOR THIS FALL WE HAD

01:05:06.068 --> 01:05:08.804
A 13% INCREASE IN CALIFORNIA

01:05:08.871 --> 01:05:10.906
UNDERGRADUATE APPLICATIONS WE

01:05:10.973 --> 01:05:13.542
HAVE SIGNIFICANT WEIGHTLESS

01:05:13.609 --> 01:05:15.177
WITH HIGHLY QUALIFIED STUDENTS.

01:05:15.244 --> 01:05:16.879
IF WE HAD THE FUNDING WE CAN

01:05:16.946 --> 01:05:18.848
PULL THOSE STUDENTS AND ENROLL

01:05:18.914 --> 01:05:22.318
THEM THIS FALL SO WE CAN ALIGN

01:05:22.385 --> 01:05:24.587
OUR PRIORITIES- SHOULD THERE BE

01:05:24.654 --> 01:05:26.522
FUNDING FOR IT. I WOULD ALSO

01:05:26.589 --> 01:05:28.424
NOTE THAT REGARDING OUR

01:05:28.491 --> 01:05:31.661
INITIATIVE- THE FRAMEWORK

01:05:31.727 --> 01:05:32.695
TWENTY THIRTY TO GET STUDENTS

01:05:32.762 --> 01:05:35.865
TO GRADUATE FASTER. WE HAVE SO

01:05:35.931 --> 01:05:37.466
MANY PELL GRANT ELIGIBLE

01:05:37.533 --> 01:05:39.902
STUDENTS THAT IF WE GET THEM TO

01:05:39.969 --> 01:05:41.604
GRADUATE AT THE SAME TIME AS

01:05:41.671 --> 01:05:44.807
NON ALL ELIGIBLE STUDENTS. WE

01:05:44.874 --> 01:05:46.942
COULD INCREASE THROUGHPUT BY

01:05:47.009 --> 01:05:48.444
MORE THAN FIFTEEN HUNDRED

01:05:48.511 --> 01:05:49.779
STUDENTS EACH YEAR THAT WOULD

01:05:49.845 --> 01:05:50.913
BE AN INCREASE AT THE

01:05:50.980 --> 01:05:52.048
CALIFORNIA UNDERGRADUATE

01:05:52.114 --> 01:05:53.849
CLASSES THAT WE'RE TAKING AND

01:05:53.916 --> 01:05:55.785
SO THERE'S THAT INVESTMENT

01:05:55.851 --> 01:05:57.119
WHILE IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S NOT AN

01:05:57.186 --> 01:05:58.854
INVESTMENT ENROLLMENT BECAUSE

01:05:58.921 --> 01:06:00.056

SUCCESS. IT ACTUALLY ULTIMATELY.

01:06:05.561 --> 01:06:06.095

AND FRANKLY NOW THE SENATE IS

01:06:57.546 --> 01:06:59.215
PUSHING HARD ON THIS AS FAR AS

01:06:59.281 --> 01:07:01.684

THOSE. AT THOSE- PREMIERE

01:07:19.001 --> 01:07:19.969
CAMPUSES IS JUST THROUGH THE

ROOF. AND IT'S HARDEST TO SHOW

01:07:23.205 --> 01:07:24.440
THAT THERE'S OPPORTUNITIES FOR

01:07:24.507 --> 01:07:26.842
CALIFORNIANS SO. AS WE KNOW IT

01:07:26.909 --> 01:07:29.578

SIGNIFICANT ONE TIME RESOURCES

01:07:31.914 --> 01:07:34.316
SO. IS IT SAID ALL A PRIORITY

01:07:34.383 --> 01:07:37.319
OF THE ADMINISTRATION. TO LOWER

01:07:37.386 --> 01:07:40.723
THE- THERE THE RATIO. AT THOSE

01:07:40.790 --> 01:07:42.057

INCREASINGLY. TICKED UP A

01:07:53.002 --> 01:07:54.069
PROBLEM. WE'RE BURNSIDE OFF

01:07:54.136 --> 01:07:57.673
ACCESS FOR CALIFORNIANS. SO

01:07:57.740 --> 01:07:59.975
WHAT'S YOURS LET ME STAY ON ON

01:08:00.042 --> 01:08:02.411
AGAIN ON RESIDENT ENROLLMENT

HERE MINISTRATION IS OPEN TO

01:08:04.013 --> 01:08:04.780
FURTHER DISCUSSION WE KNOW

01:08:04.847 --> 01:08:06.649
THAT'S A LEGISLATIVE PRIORITY

01:08:06.715 --> 01:08:07.850
IN TERMS OF NONRESIDENT

01:08:07.917 --> 01:08:10.920
ENROLLMENT WE WOULD JUST NOTE

01:08:10.986 --> 01:08:12.655
THAT TO THE EXTENT THAT. THAT

01:08:12.721 --> 01:08:14.623
NONRESIDENT ENROLLMENT WENT

01:08:14.690 --> 01:08:16.158
DOWNTOWN AND THEREFORE ON

01:08:16.225 --> 01:08:18.394
RESIDENT TUITION WENT DOWN THAT

01:08:18.461 --> 01:08:20.262
WOULD CREATE SIGNIFICANT COST

01:08:20.329 --> 01:08:22.431
PRESSURE ON THE STATE TO BACK

01:08:22.498 --> 01:08:25.201
FILL THAT. YEAH I'M NOT SURE IF

01:08:25.267 --> 01:08:27.436
THAT'S TRUE THAT NON RESIDENT-

01:08:27.503 --> 01:08:29.472
APPLICATIONS WENT DOWN BUT THEY

01:08:29.538 --> 01:08:33.142
WENT DOWN FROM LIKE SIXTY

01:08:33.209 --> 01:08:33.742
THOUSAND TO FIFTY FIVE I'M NOT

01:08:33.809 --> 01:08:34.376
SURE THE NUMBER STILL SLIGHTLY

01:08:34.443 --> 01:08:36.111
DOWN AND THE NUMBER OF SLOTS

01:08:36.178 --> 01:08:38.147
YOU HAD FOR NON RESIDENTS WAS

01:08:38.214 --> 01:08:40.683
STILL. YOU KNOW YOU HAD FOUR

01:08:40.749 --> 01:08:42.651
MORE TIMES APPLICATIONS IF I

01:08:42.718 --> 01:08:44.920
RECALL THAN SLOTS AVAILABLE FOR

01:08:44.987 --> 01:08:46.789
NON RESIDENTS SO THERE'S STILL

01:08:46.856 --> 01:08:48.524
A TREMENDOUS DEMAND IN

PRESIDENT WAS YOU KNOW MAKING

01:08:53.162 --> 01:08:54.563
THAT YOU KNOW HARDER AND LESS

01:08:54.630 --> 01:08:55.364

01:08:59.668 --> 01:09:01.770
DEMAND- FOR INTERNATIONAL BUT

01:09:01.837 --> 01:09:03.506
MORE IMPORTANTLY ARE ARE YOU

01:09:03.572 --> 01:09:06.609
WILLING TO LOWER THE RATIO AT

01:09:06.675 --> 01:09:08.978
THE THREE PREMIERE CAMPUSES. SO

01:09:13.048 --> 01:09:16.018
FIVE GPAS AND- AND DOING VERY

01:09:16.085 --> 01:09:18.721
WELL CAN CAN BE MORE VIABLE.

01:09:18.787 --> 01:09:19.655
FOR OUR UNIVERSITY OF

01:09:19.722 --> 01:09:23.726
CALIFORNIA FLAGSHIP CAMPUSES.

01:09:23.792 --> 01:09:26.228

01:09:26.295 --> 01:09:26.862
PROPOSAL THAT COMES MORE THAN

01:09:26.929 --> 01:09:29.465

01:09:35.237 --> 01:09:37.339
NON RESIDENT TUITION I WENT

01:09:37.406 --> 01:09:39.141
DOWN FOR THE UC SYSTEM THAT

01:09:39.208 --> 01:09:40.276
WOULD BE A SIGNIFICANT COST

01:09:40.342 --> 01:09:42.344
PRESSURE ON THE STATE TOBACCO

01:09:42.411 --> 01:09:44.880
YEAH AND ONE THING IS THAT- I

01:09:44.947 --> 01:09:46.649

CHARGING MORE NONRESIDENT

01:09:50.386 --> 01:09:52.421
TUITION. I THINK IS AN

01:09:52.488 --> 01:09:55.724
OPPORTUNITY TO FURTHER. HELP

01:09:55.791 --> 01:09:57.226

FOR THE UC AT ITS FACILITIES

01:15:01.563 --> 01:15:02.831
NOT ALWAYS THE MOST EXCITING

01:15:02.898 --> 01:15:04.700
TOPIC IN THIS ROOM BUT

01:15:04.766 --> 01:15:06.635
FACILITIES ARE IMPORTANT. WELL

01:15:06.702 --> 01:15:07.569
LAST YEAR WE HAD A SCHOOL BOND

01:15:07.636 --> 01:15:09.371

01:15:09.438 --> 01:15:12.274
VARIETY OF REASONS- MS CALL

THINGS THAT THE PEOPLE DIDN'T

01:15:16.578 --> 01:15:17.980
LIKE MAYBE THE DOLLAR THRESHOLD

01:15:18.046 --> 01:15:20.315
WAS TOO HIGH. BUT ALSO RESEARCH

01:15:20.382 --> 01:15:21.450
HAS SHOWN THAT ONE OF THE

01:15:21.516 --> 01:15:22.818
REASONS THAT WE DIDN'T RECEIVE

01:15:22.885 --> 01:15:24.553
AS MUCH SUPPORT AS BECAUSE

01:15:24.620 --> 01:15:26.555
HIGHER EDUCATION. WAS IN THAT

01:15:26.622 --> 01:15:28.290
THAT BOND. SO I WENT OUT AND

01:15:28.357 --> 01:15:29.758
DID SOME RESEARCH AND WHAT I

01:15:29.825 --> 01:15:32.361
FOUND WAS THAT IN TWENTY

01:15:32.427 --> 01:15:32.961
THIRTEEN THERE WAS ACTUALLY AN

01:15:33.028 --> 01:15:33.528
AGREEMENT STAKEHOLDERS CAME

NEXT SCHOOL BOND. BUT WE ARE

01:15:37.432 --> 01:15:38.433
GOING TO GIVE YOU TWO HUNDRED

01:15:38.500 --> 01:15:39.468

SEGMENT TO UNDER MILLION

01:15:40.202 --> 01:15:41.670
DOLLARS HERE. WE'RE ALSO GOING

01:15:41.737 --> 01:15:42.938
TO LET YOURSELF BOND FOR YOUR

01:15:43.005 --> 01:15:45.073
FAILITIES TO A MILLION DOLLARS

01:15:45.140 --> 01:15:47.309
HERE. AND GET A CELLPHONE. SO

01:15:47.376 --> 01:15:49.111
AS WE GO FORWARD- MY QUESTION

01:15:49.177 --> 01:15:50.345
FOR YOU IS DO YOU DO YOU WANT

FACILITIES- HAVE DONE BETTER

01:16:10.265 --> 01:16:11.366
UNDER THAT MODEL THEN GOING

COVERED THOSE FROM OUR OWN

01:16:32.421 --> 01:16:34.856
BUDGET. WHEN I TALKED ABOUT OUR

01:16:34.923 --> 01:16:37.592
BASE BUDGET HAVING OF BONDS.

01:16:37.659 --> 01:16:39.995

COLLATERAL. WE ARE NOW

MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR IN COST

01:16:56.144 --> 01:16:57.612
INCREASES DUE TO THE BUILDINGS

WE ARE BUILDING. SO THAT

01:16:58.981 --> 01:17:01.049
PROCESS IS WORKING FOR US. WE

01:17:01.116 --> 01:17:02.951

01:17:08.490 --> 01:17:11.626
PLACES. ACOSTA STRAIN. ON THE

TAKE FIFTEEN UNITS- TERM- IT'S

01:50:39.833 --> 01:50:40.734
GONNA REQUIRE A LONG TERM

01:50:40.800 --> 01:50:42.635
INVESTMENT. THAT WE WEREN'T

ADVANCE OF THE OF THE KOBE

01:50:52.012 --> 01:50:54.314
BUDGET THERE IS A DECIDED A

01:50:54.381 --> 01:50:55.849
DECISION TO REDUCE THE

SO TO SPEAK. BUT I WILL ECHO

01:51:26.079 --> 01:51:28.548

AND SHIP AND IT'S NOT ONLY JUST

01:51:52.906 --> 01:51:54.674
FOR BEDFORD BETTER THROUGHPUT.

01:51:54.741 --> 01:51:56.743
BUT IT'S ADDITIONAL- SUPPORT IN

01:51:56.810 --> 01:51:58.611
ORDER TO ELIMINATE THOSE EQUITY

01:51:58.678 --> 01:52:00.580
GAPS THAT HAVE BANNED AT ALL OF

01:52:00.647 --> 01:52:04.117
ARE. AT THE FOREFRONT OF ALL OF

01:52:04.184 --> 01:52:05.251
OUR MINDS. SO I THINK YOU GOT

01:52:05.318 --> 01:52:06.186
IT. I THINK FUNDED

01:52:06.252 --> 01:52:07.220
FUNDAMENTALLY YOU HAVE TO

01:52:07.287 --> 01:52:08.621
SUPPORT THE UNIVERSITY AND THE

01:52:08.688 --> 01:52:09.489
NUMBER OF STUDENTS THAT WE

01:52:09.556 --> 01:52:11.925
CURRENTLY HAVE WHICH IS ABOUT

01:52:11.991 --> 01:52:12.425
FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY SIX

01:52:12.492 --> 01:52:14.060
THOUSAND STUDENTS. AND IF YOU

01:52:14.127 --> 01:52:14.694
HAVE ADDITIONAL MONEY TO ADD ON

01:52:14.761 --> 01:52:16.963
TOP OF THAT. WE AGREED THAT WE

01:52:17.030 --> 01:52:17.664
WOULD BE ABLE TO GROW AND

01:52:17.730 --> 01:52:19.466
ROLLED. WE HAVE TWENTY THREE

CAMPUSES WE HAVE A LOT OF

01:52:21.334 --> 01:52:23.403
CAPACITY PHYSICAL CAPACITY THAT

01:52:23.470 --> 01:52:24.471
WE CAN STILL FILL WITH

01:52:24.537 --> 01:52:25.438
ADDITIONAL STUDENTS THAT THE

01:52:25.505 --> 01:52:26.606
HARD PART IS THAT WE DON'T HAVE

01:52:26.673 --> 01:52:28.074
THE RESOURCES IN ORDER TO HIRE

01:52:28.141 --> 01:52:29.742
THOSE FACULTY IN THE SUPPORT.

01:52:29.809 --> 01:52:31.544
FOLKS TO BE ABLE TO DO MORE. I

01:52:31.611 --> 01:52:33.246
KNOW THAT'S NOT GOING TO BE A

01:52:33.313 --> 01:52:35.048
SATISFACTORY ANSWER FOR YOU.

01:52:35.115 --> 01:52:36.749
ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY FROM

01:52:36.816 --> 01:52:37.851
THE FROM THE VANTAGE POINT OF

01:52:37.917 --> 01:52:39.252
WHY DON'T WE JUST GET OUT OF

01:52:39.319 --> 01:52:40.253
THERE. BUT WORK WORK WE'RE

01:52:40.320 --> 01:52:41.588
STAYING TRIED AND TRUE WITH OUR

01:52:41.654 --> 01:52:43.189
BUDGET REQUEST THAT WAS ADOPTED

01:52:43.256 --> 01:52:45.225
BY THE BOARD. AS AND GET AS A

01:52:45.291 --> 01:52:47.460
CHANCER HAS PURSUED AND AS AS

01:52:47.527 --> 01:52:48.528
EXPRESSED ON MULTIPLE OCCASIONS

TO ENROLLMENT GROWTH. YEAH AND

01:52:56.002 --> 01:52:56.736
THE AND THAT LEADS TO MY OTHER

01:52:56.803 --> 01:53:00.440
QUESTION SO. WE DON'T HAVE-

01:53:00.507 --> 01:53:05.712

01:53:05.778 --> 01:53:06.246
GRADUATION INITIATIVE HERE

IS OUR ABILITY TO FULLY FUND

01:53:13.620 --> 01:53:15.321

01:53:16.322 --> 01:53:18.324
PROPOSED IN JANUARY ADDED THE

SEVENTY FOUR POINT FOUR THAT IS

01:53:19.893 --> 01:53:21.327
PROPOSED TO BE REVISION. WE

CAN'T FULLY FUND THE GRADUATION

01:53:23.530 --> 01:53:25.265
INITIATIVE. OKAY IF THERE'S

01:53:25.331 --> 01:53:26.099
ANYTHING LESS THAN THAT WE

01:53:26.166 --> 01:53:27.867
CAN'T DO IT. GOTCHA SO WHAT WE

01:53:27.934 --> 01:53:29.602

MORE SLEEP AND MORE SLOTS THAT

01:53:43.616 --> 01:53:45.351
THAT THE OTHER THING THAT. YOU

01:53:45.418 --> 01:53:46.386

FIFTY THOUSAND CSU STUDENTS.

01:53:51.758 --> 01:53:54.460
GRADUATE WITHIN FOUR YEARS OR

01:53:54.527 --> 01:53:58.464
FOUR PLUS AND NOT. LINGER. FOR

01:53:58.531 --> 01:53:59.365
MULTIPLE YEARS AFTER- SO EVERY

01:53:59.432 --> 01:54:00.266
ELSE THAT WERE PUT HERE FOR

01:54:00.333 --> 01:54:01.901
POLY TAC IN NORTHRIDGE AND ALL

01:54:01.968 --> 01:54:03.703
THIS OTHER STUFF IS. IS GOOD

01:54:03.770 --> 01:54:05.972
FOR HIGHER ED BUT IF WE REALLY

01:54:06.039 --> 01:54:07.974
WANT TO ADDRESS THE KEY ISSUE.

01:54:08.041 --> 01:54:08.942
AND HIGHER EDUCATION ACCESS

01:54:09.008 --> 01:54:11.077
AND- AND FRANKLY WE LOCKED LOOK

01:54:11.144 --> 01:54:12.345
AT AFFORDABILITY LOOK AT THE

01:54:12.412 --> 01:54:14.747
DEBT CRISIS WHICH WE'RE GONNA

01:54:14.814 --> 01:54:15.315
TALK ABOUT LATER WOULD STILL

01:54:15.381 --> 01:54:17.116
NEED COMMISSION. THE FOUR YEAR

01:54:17.183 --> 01:54:18.785
GRADUATION RATE IS THAT IS THAT

01:54:18.851 --> 01:54:20.520
IS THE NUMBER ONE YOU KNOW.

01:54:20.587 --> 01:54:23.723
LINK BETWEEN THOSE TWO THINGS.

01:54:23.790 --> 01:54:25.725
OKAY THAT'S IT FOR NOW

01:54:25.792 --> 01:54:28.461
QUESTIONS MISTER- O'DONNELL BY

01:54:28.528 --> 01:54:30.930
A DENTIST AND MEDINA. THANK

01:54:30.997 --> 01:54:32.665
YOU- AND I DON'T KNOW IF THIS

01:54:32.732 --> 01:54:33.866
WAS BROACHED I WAS OUT OF THE

01:54:33.933 --> 01:54:36.502
ROOM FOR A MOMENT AGO. UP IN

01:54:36.569 --> 01:54:39.272
CLASS INSTRUCTION IN CLASS.

01:54:39.339 --> 01:54:41.574
CLASSES ARE ON A LABEL IT. BACK

01:54:41.641 --> 01:54:44.077
AT THE CAMPUS NOT ONLINE THAT'S

01:54:44.143 --> 01:54:44.677
THE PLAN FOR NEXT YEAR IS THAT

01:54:44.744 --> 01:54:48.181
ACCURATE. THAT'S GENERALLY THE

01:54:48.248 --> 01:54:51.451
PLAN RIGHT- OBVIOUSLY I THINK

01:54:51.517 --> 01:54:53.086
LIKE ALL OF US IN ALL OF OUR

01:54:53.152 --> 01:54:55.088
RESPECTIVE CAPACITIES IT'S ALL

01:54:55.154 --> 01:54:56.289
GONNA DEPEND ON HOW THE DISEASE

01:54:56.356 --> 01:54:57.991
PROGRESSES GOING FORWARD. AS OF

01:54:58.057 --> 01:54:59.259
RIGHT NOW IT LOOKS LIKE

01:54:59.325 --> 01:55:01.227
EVERYTHING IS LOOKING GOOD SO-

01:55:01.294 --> 01:55:02.829
I WOULD SAY THAT WE HAVE BEEN

01:55:02.895 --> 01:55:04.063
CAUTIOUSLY MOVING TOWARDS

01:55:04.130 --> 01:55:05.298
OPENING MORE AND MORE COURSE

01:55:05.365 --> 01:55:07.533
SECTIONS IN PERSON AS WE GO

01:55:07.600 --> 01:55:11.504
FORWARD- AND- OBVIOUSLY THE

01:55:11.571 --> 01:55:14.340
IDEA HERE IS. A LONGER TERM IS

01:55:14.407 --> 01:55:16.042
TO BE ABLE TO DO A LITTLE BIT

01:55:16.109 --> 01:55:17.644
OF BALANCING RIGHT. LOT OF

01:55:17.710 --> 01:55:18.878
OPPORTUNITY FOR IN PERSON

01:55:18.945 --> 01:55:21.447
INSTRUCTION BUT ALSO OFFERING

01:55:21.514 --> 01:55:23.583
COURSES THAT ARE HYBRIDS AND

01:55:23.650 --> 01:55:25.118
MARK MORE COURSES THAT ARE ON

01:55:25.184 --> 01:55:27.186
THAT ARE FULLY ONLINE. GIVES A

01:55:27.253 --> 01:55:29.656
STUDENTS FAR MORE FLEXIBILITY

01:55:29.722 --> 01:55:31.224
IN TERMS OF THEIR SCHEDULING

01:55:31.291 --> 01:55:32.725
AND THEIR ABILITY TO MANAGE

01:55:32.792 --> 01:55:34.627
WORK LIFE EXPERIENCES BUT YES I

01:55:34.694 --> 01:55:36.696
THINK FOR THE UPCOMING FALL OUR

01:55:36.763 --> 01:55:38.197
GOAL IS TO GET AS MANY COURSES

01:55:38.264 --> 01:55:39.666
WE CAN'T FOR MINE. IT'S ALL

01:55:39.732 --> 01:55:41.467
DEPEND ALSO ON ALL THE LOCAL

01:55:41.534 --> 01:55:43.736
AND REGIONAL- REQUIREMENTS BY

01:55:43.803 --> 01:55:47.173
LOCAL. HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AS

01:55:47.240 --> 01:55:48.708
WELL. I AND I GET THE HOW

01:55:48.775 --> 01:55:49.542
REQUIRE AND AGREE THAT THEY

01:55:49.609 --> 01:55:52.445
NEED BE ACCOMMODATED. BUT I

01:55:52.512 --> 01:55:53.980
DON'T I CAN ONLY SPEAK FOR

01:55:54.047 --> 01:55:55.448
MYSELF AND FOR OTHERS IN THE

01:55:55.515 --> 01:55:56.849
ROOM FEEL THE SAME THAT. A YOU

01:55:56.916 --> 01:55:58.284
NEED TO MOVE BACK ON CAMPUS.

01:55:58.351 --> 01:56:00.753
AND FALL IF THINGS KEEP GOING

01:56:00.820 --> 01:56:02.155
IN THE DIRECTION THEY'RE GOING.

01:56:02.221 --> 01:56:03.556
I WALK THROUGH LONG BEACH STATE

01:56:03.623 --> 01:56:05.458
WHEN I'M HOME. JUST ABOUT EVERY

01:56:05.525 --> 01:56:07.460
DAY. AND THE PRAISE THE PLACES

01:56:07.527 --> 01:56:08.695
PRETTY DESOLATE THERE'S SOME

01:56:08.761 --> 01:56:10.196
STUFF GOING ON THERE NOW. BUT

01:56:10.263 --> 01:56:11.197
IT'S PRETTY DESOLATE IT'S A

01:56:11.264 --> 01:56:13.599
LARGE CAMPUS WITH- A LOT OF

01:56:13.666 --> 01:56:14.801
FACILITIES IN THEIR EMPTY IT'S

01:56:14.867 --> 01:56:16.636
RATHER TRAGIC TO SEE AND I KNOW

01:56:16.703 --> 01:56:18.104
YOU AGREE WITH ME. BUT AGAIN I

01:56:18.171 --> 01:56:21.174
JUST WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT- WE

01:56:21.240 --> 01:56:23.609
NEED TO GET STUDENTS BACK. TO

01:56:23.676 --> 01:56:24.610
THE CAMPUS IN THE FALL IN THE

01:56:24.677 --> 01:56:26.713
FALL. IF THINGS KEEP HEADING

01:56:26.779 --> 01:56:28.381
THAT DIRECTION. THEY'RE

01:56:28.448 --> 01:56:31.117
HEADING. AND ALSO ONE OTHER

01:56:31.184 --> 01:56:32.719
TOPICS THE SHARK LAB LONG BEACH

01:56:32.785 --> 01:56:33.720
STATE THAT'S INTERNATIONALLY

01:56:33.786 --> 01:56:36.155
KNOWN ACTUALLY. LOCALLY FAMOUS

01:56:36.222 --> 01:56:39.158
AS WELL- DR LAW THE SHARK LAB

01:56:39.225 --> 01:56:40.360
SHARK WEEK HE'S ON THERE ALL

01:56:40.426 --> 01:56:42.328
THE TIME- IT'S NOT ALWAYS FOR

01:56:42.395 --> 01:56:44.130
ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES QUITE

01:56:44.197 --> 01:56:44.630
FRANKLY IT'S FOR SCIENCE

01:56:44.697 --> 01:56:46.265
PURPOSES. THAT'S WHERE HE COMES

01:56:46.332 --> 01:56:49.736
FROM- AND WHEN Y. ESPECIALLY

01:56:49.802 --> 01:56:51.037
CALIFORNIA WE HAVE A LOT MORE

01:56:51.104 --> 01:56:53.072
SHARK ACTIVITY ALONG OUR SHORE.

01:56:53.139 --> 01:56:54.307
WHEN I WAS A KID GOING OUT TO

01:56:54.374 --> 01:56:55.842
THE BEACH IN LONG BEACH. WE

01:56:55.908 --> 01:56:58.010
NEVER SAW A SEALED WE NEVER SAW

01:56:58.077 --> 01:56:59.712
A DOLPHIN WE NEVER EVEN THOUGHT

01:56:59.779 --> 01:57:01.848
OF A SHARK. NOW THERE ARE SEALS

01:57:01.914 --> 01:57:02.915
NOW THERE ARE DOLPHINS AND

01:57:02.982 --> 01:57:04.617
THEY'RE ACTUALLY SHARKS WHAT WE

01:57:04.684 --> 01:57:05.218
HAVE TO CALL THE KIDS OUT OF

01:57:05.284 --> 01:57:08.521
THE WATER. AND WHAT WE NEED TO

01:57:08.588 --> 01:57:10.123
STUDY THOSE A DOCTOR LOW. OUT

01:57:10.189 --> 01:57:11.457
OF THE SHARK LAB HAS DONE A

01:57:11.524 --> 01:57:13.726
GREAT JOB OF THAT WE GOT AND WE

01:57:13.793 --> 01:57:15.795
GOT AN ALLOCATION ABOUT FOUR

01:57:15.862 --> 01:57:17.296
FIVE YEARS AGO. AND WHAT I'M

01:57:17.363 --> 01:57:18.297
SEEKING TO DO THIS YEAR'S

01:57:18.364 --> 01:57:20.733
CONTINUE- GETTING MONEY TO THE

01:57:20.800 --> 01:57:23.002
SHARK LAB SO IT CAN CONTINUE.

01:57:23.069 --> 01:57:24.637
TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE SAFE

01:57:24.704 --> 01:57:26.172
WATERS WE UNDERSTAND SHARK

01:57:26.239 --> 01:57:28.141
BEHAVIOR. SHARKS ARE PART OF

01:57:28.207 --> 01:57:30.343
OUR ECOSYSTEM IT ALSO SPEAKS TO

01:57:30.410 --> 01:57:31.377
OUR ECONOMY TO. THE USE OF

01:57:31.444 --> 01:57:32.378
PEOPLE START HEARING ABOUT

01:57:32.445 --> 01:57:33.446
SHARK ALERTS ALONG OUR

01:57:33.513 --> 01:57:35.248
SHORELINE. THAT COME GOING TO

01:57:35.314 --> 01:57:36.449
COME TO OUR BEACHES TO VISIT

01:57:36.516 --> 01:57:37.417
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO SPEND

01:57:37.483 --> 01:57:38.951
MONEY IN SUPPORT THE TOWNS.

01:57:39.018 --> 01:57:40.453
ALONG THE BEACHES AND WE NEED

01:57:40.520 --> 01:57:41.687
THAT TO HAPPEN. SO I JUST WANT

01:57:41.754 --> 01:57:43.523
TO HIGHLIGHT. THE IMPORTANCE OF

01:57:43.589 --> 01:57:45.224
THE SHARK LAB. TO CALIFORNIA

01:57:45.291 --> 01:57:46.526
YES THE WORLD BUT REALLY

01:57:46.592 --> 01:57:48.761
CALIFORNIA FROM MY PERSPECTIVE.

01:57:48.828 --> 01:57:50.062
AND THAT THEY'RE DOING REALLY

01:57:50.129 --> 01:57:50.563
IMPORTANT WORK THERE ARE

01:57:50.630 --> 01:57:52.732
CUTTING EDGE WORK. HOW THE HOW

01:57:52.799 --> 01:57:53.933
THEY IDENTIFY WHEN SHARKS ARE

01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:56.436
COMING NEAR THE WATER. AND

01:57:56.502 --> 01:57:58.004
DIFFERENT TYPES OF TECHNOLOGY

01:57:58.070 --> 01:58:03.309
THAT CAN ALERT US SO THAT WE.

01:58:03.376 --> 01:58:05.311
CAN- YOUR PARTNER OKAY. YOU'RE

01:58:05.378 --> 01:58:06.879
RIGHT- IN IN AND SHE THAT OUR

01:58:06.946 --> 01:58:07.880
WILL SOURCE. WE DON'T TO SCAN

01:58:07.947 --> 01:58:08.815
THE OLD THE SEVENTIES WHAT

01:58:08.881 --> 01:58:10.082
KILLED. THAT WAS THE ANSWER

NEXT TERM WOULD BE AGAIN ONLINE.

02:02:44.457 --> 02:02:56.702

KNOW AS I KNOW. AS AN EDUCATOR.

02:03:42.882 --> 02:03:44.817
THAT WHAT HAPPENS IN COLLEGE IN

02:03:44.884 --> 02:03:46.886
THE COLLEGE EXPERIENCE IS NOT

02:03:46.952 --> 02:03:48.988
JUST WHAT HAPPENS IN CLASS AND

02:03:49.054 --> 02:03:50.790
CERTAINLY WHAT HAPPENS IN CLASS

02:03:50.856 --> 02:03:51.824
WHEN IT'S ONLINE IS MUCH

02:03:51.891 --> 02:03:53.259
DIFFERENT. FROM IN PERSON

02:03:53.325 --> 02:03:55.528
INSTRUCTION BUT ALSO THE

02:03:55.594 --> 02:03:56.529
COLLEGE EXPERIENCE IS WHAT

02:03:56.595 --> 02:03:59.498
HAPPENS WHEN STUDENTS ARE ABLE

02:03:59.565 --> 02:04:03.602
TO MIX. AND EXCHANGE IDEAS-

02:04:03.669 --> 02:04:06.172
WHETHER IT BE ON CAMPUS OR IN

02:04:06.238 --> 02:04:08.541
THEIR DORMS. AND SO VERY MUCH

02:04:08.607 --> 02:04:12.344
WANT TO- URGE. CSU TO OFFER AS

02:04:12.411 --> 02:04:15.447
MANY CLASSES- IN THE NEXT TERM-

02:04:15.514 --> 02:04:18.384
IN PERSON. AND HOPE THAT WE CAN

02:04:18.450 --> 02:04:20.319
SEE THAT- NEXT YEAR AND THEN

02:04:20.386 --> 02:04:23.155
CERTAINLY ALL OF OUR-

02:04:23.222 --> 02:04:26.659
CONSTITUENTS. IN OURSELVES WILL

02:04:26.725 --> 02:04:28.160
BE BE WATCHING. OKAY THANK ANY

02:04:28.227 --> 02:04:32.898
ADVICE QUESTION- TO CSU. WE SAW

02:04:32.965 --> 02:04:35.434
LAST YEAR THE GOVERNOR SIGNED-

02:04:35.501 --> 02:04:38.103
LEGISLATION A DOCTOR WEBER IS

02:04:38.170 --> 02:04:40.873
BILL TO- MAKE ETHNIC STUDIES

02:04:40.940 --> 02:04:44.243
REQUIREMENT FOR GRADUATION- I

02:04:44.310 --> 02:04:45.911
BELIEVE IT'S ALREADY BEING

02:04:45.978 --> 02:04:46.745
IMPLEMENTED OR WILL BE

02:04:46.812 --> 02:04:49.481
IMPLEMENTED- FOR GRADUATION AND

02:04:49.548 --> 02:04:51.584
THEN THE NEXT NEXT TERM SO MY

02:04:51.650 --> 02:04:53.452
QUESTION TO CSU IS THERE

02:04:53.519 --> 02:04:56.322
FUNDING- IS THERE FUNDING OR

02:04:56.388 --> 02:04:59.158
THE BEEN REQUEST FOR FUNDING-

02:04:59.225 --> 02:05:02.261
TO- COVER THE COST OF OFFERING

02:05:02.328 --> 02:05:06.665
THOSE CLASSES. TO CSU. ASSEMBLY

02:05:06.732 --> 02:05:09.802
MEMBER MEDINA- ALL ALL TALK

02:05:09.869 --> 02:05:10.336
ABOUT BOTH OF THOSE ISSUES

02:05:10.402 --> 02:05:12.671
ABOUT REAL QUICKLY IN TERMS OF

02:05:12.738 --> 02:05:14.039
THE SPECIFICS ON THE LONG BEACH

02:05:14.106 --> 02:05:16.809
SITUATION I WOULD HAVE TO. TALK

02:05:16.876 --> 02:05:17.910
TO THE CAMPUS A LITTLE BIT

02:05:17.977 --> 02:05:20.779
ABOUT THAT- MY SUSPICION THOUGH

02:05:20.846 --> 02:05:22.882
IS A LOT LIKE WHERE WE

02:05:22.948 --> 02:05:24.350
ABANDONED ALL OF US IN OUR

02:05:24.416 --> 02:05:26.719
RESPECTIVE LIVES WHERE PLANNING

02:05:26.785 --> 02:05:28.287
IS FOR ONE THING AND WHAT

02:05:28.354 --> 02:05:30.389
MATERIALIZES IS A DIFFERENT

02:05:30.456 --> 02:05:32.291
THING THAT THAT HAPPENS SO FOR

02:05:32.358 --> 02:05:33.659
EXAMPLE IN MY OWN PERSONAL LIFE

02:05:33.726 --> 02:05:35.527
I HAVE KIDS THAT STARTED THE

02:05:35.594 --> 02:05:37.496
WHOLE YEAR FULLY ONLINE AND AS

02:05:37.563 --> 02:05:41.133
AS THINGS. LOOSENED UP. TO

02:05:41.200 --> 02:05:42.334
ATTEND IN PERSON RIGHT. SO I

02:05:42.401 --> 02:05:43.469
WOULD IMAGINE THAT THIS

02:05:43.535 --> 02:05:44.703
STUDENTS EXPERIENCE OF

02:05:44.770 --> 02:05:46.272
REGISTERING AND FINDING ONLY

02:05:46.338 --> 02:05:47.840
FOR COURSES OR OR OR THREE

02:05:47.907 --> 02:05:49.341
WHATEVER THE NUMBER WAS. BEING

02:05:49.408 --> 02:05:51.210
FULLY ONLINE I WOULD IMAGINE

02:05:51.277 --> 02:05:52.912
THAT WITH THE URGENCY OF ALL OF

02:05:52.978 --> 02:05:54.246
OUR CAMPUSES WHITES AND RE OPEN

02:05:54.313 --> 02:05:55.948
BECAUSE IT'S NOT JUST. FOR THE

02:05:56.015 --> 02:05:57.116
STATE EXPERIENCE BUT FACULTY

02:05:57.182 --> 02:05:58.651
AND STAFF I WANT TO RETURN AS

02:05:58.717 --> 02:06:00.252
WELL AS SOON AS WE CAN. BUT I

02:06:00.319 --> 02:06:01.887
WOULD IMAGINE THAT THOSE THOSE

02:06:01.954 --> 02:06:03.689
COURSES WELL SOME OF THEM WILL

02:06:03.756 --> 02:06:06.592
BE THEN CONVERTED AND BECOME-

02:06:06.659 --> 02:06:10.095
IN PERSON. AS TIME PERMITS AS

02:06:10.162 --> 02:06:11.297
WE GET CLOSER TO THE FALL AND

02:06:11.363 --> 02:06:12.398
THINGS LOOK LIKE THEY CAN BE

02:06:12.464 --> 02:06:14.400
MORE OPEN AND THAT SORT OF

02:06:14.466 --> 02:06:15.701
THING SO I WOULD THINK THAT. AS

02:06:15.768 --> 02:06:16.936
TRENDS ARE GOING RIGHT NOW I

02:06:17.002 --> 02:06:18.637
WOULD IMAGINE THAT. DISTANCE

02:06:18.704 --> 02:06:20.439
EXPERIENCE MAY BE THAT YOU KNOW

02:06:20.506 --> 02:06:21.674

02:06:21.740 --> 02:06:24.510
ULTIMATELY BE. UP OUT IN PERSON

INSURANCE ABOUT THAT BUT I

02:06:28.047 --> 02:06:29.315

TREND THAT WE'RE HEADING DOWN

02:06:29.982 --> 02:06:33.852

02:06:44.096 --> 02:06:45.564
EVERYBODY'S ANGLE HERE IS TO

02:10:54.580 --> 02:10:55.681
WHAT WAS ASKED EARLIER THE

02:10:55.747 --> 02:10:58.850

THE QUESTION WELL- I WOULD SAY

02:11:34.186 --> 02:11:35.554
WE DON'T NEED ANYTHING OTHER

02:11:35.621 --> 02:11:37.889
THAN FUNDING- WE HAVE CAPACITY

02:11:37.956 --> 02:11:40.859
ON ON OUR CAMPUSES TO BE ABLE

02:11:40.926 --> 02:11:42.961

02:11:43.028 --> 02:11:44.429
CAPACITY TO ACCOMMODATE-

LECTURE HALLS WE HAVE THE

02:11:50.435 --> 02:11:52.404
SMALLER CLASSROOMS WE CAN DO

02:11:52.471 --> 02:11:54.940

DEMOGRAPHICS- WE HAVE A LARGE-

02:12:01.713 --> 02:12:03.215
LET NEXT POPULATION THAT

02:12:03.282 --> 02:12:05.050
REFLECTS THE POPULATION WRIT

02:12:05.117 --> 02:12:06.285
LARGE ENOUGH OF YOUNGER

02:12:06.351 --> 02:12:08.620
CALIFORNIANS SO IN TERMS OF THE

02:12:08.687 --> 02:12:11.323
DIVERSITY AT THE UNIVERSITY I

02:12:11.390 --> 02:12:11.790
THINK PREPARE. APART

02:12:11.857 --> 02:12:13.358
PERSPECTIVE I THINK REALLY WHAT

02:12:13.425 --> 02:12:15.127
IT BOILS DOWN TO IS ADDITIONAL

02:12:15.193 --> 02:12:16.995
FUNDING SO THAT WE CAN OFFER

02:12:17.062 --> 02:12:19.498
MORE SLOT SO TO SPEAK TO

02:12:19.564 --> 02:12:20.832
STUDENTS ARE VARIOUS CAMPUSES.

02:12:20.899 --> 02:12:24.903
I WILL SAY THAT- ON ON THE

02:12:24.970 --> 02:12:26.171
ENROLLMENT. OF THINGS- THERE'S

02:12:26.238 --> 02:12:27.506
A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT WE HAVE

02:12:27.572 --> 02:12:29.941
GOING ARE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA

02:12:30.008 --> 02:12:31.843
CAMPUSES. THERE'S A LOT OF

02:12:31.910 --> 02:12:34.713
DEMAND AT THAT THERE. AND IN

02:12:34.780 --> 02:12:35.781
SOME OF OUR NORTHERN CALIFORNIA

02:12:35.847 --> 02:12:37.482
CAMPUSES DEMAND HAS SOFTENED A

02:12:37.549 --> 02:12:39.985
BIT. AND SO OUR PRIORITY WOULD

02:12:40.052 --> 02:12:42.854
BE TO OBVIOUSLY PUT IN SLOTS TO

02:12:42.921 --> 02:12:44.523
SPEAK TO THE PARTS OF THE STATE

02:12:44.589 --> 02:12:48.193
WHERE. THERE IS GREAT DEMAND SO

02:12:48.260 --> 02:12:48.727
YOU'RE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA

02:12:48.794 --> 02:12:51.396
CAMPUSES WILL LIKELY BE THE-

02:12:51.463 --> 02:12:53.732
RECIPIENT OF MORE OF THE

02:12:53.799 --> 02:12:55.067
ENROLLMENT GROWTH IF YOU WERE

02:12:55.133 --> 02:12:56.568
TO ADD ENROLLMENT AND THAT'S

02:12:56.635 --> 02:12:57.336
SIMPLY BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THE

02:12:57.402 --> 02:12:58.870
STUDENTS LIVE AND THAT'S WHERE

02:12:58.937 --> 02:13:00.639
THEY WANT TO ATTEND. AND THAT'S

02:13:00.706 --> 02:13:03.008
WHAT WE'RE SEEING SOME OF OUR

02:13:03.075 --> 02:13:04.409
CAMPUS IS BUSTING AT THE SEAMS.

02:13:04.476 --> 02:13:05.510
I WILL SAY THERE ARE A COUPLE

02:13:05.577 --> 02:13:07.879
THINGS YOU COULD DO ACTUALLY

02:13:07.946 --> 02:13:11.450
FROM A FROM A- BUDGETARY

02:13:11.516 --> 02:13:13.218
PERSPECTIVE FIRST IS. FUNDING

02:13:13.285 --> 02:13:14.820
HAS TO BE RECURRING. IT CANNOT

02:13:14.886 --> 02:13:16.955
BE ONE TIME FUNDING. RECURRING

02:13:17.022 --> 02:13:18.523
REQUIRES US TO HIRE FACULTY

02:13:18.590 --> 02:13:20.359
THAT WE'RE GOING TO COMMIT TO

02:13:20.425 --> 02:13:20.892
FOR THIRTY YEARS OF THEIR

02:13:20.959 --> 02:13:21.960
CAREER AND STAFF THAT WILL BE

02:13:22.027 --> 02:13:23.528
WITH US FOR THE DURATION OF

02:13:23.595 --> 02:13:25.097
THEIR CAREERS. THE OTHER THING

02:13:25.163 --> 02:13:26.898
TOO IS THAT IF YOU WERE TO

02:13:26.965 --> 02:13:28.633
PROVIDE US A LOT OF FUNDING FOR

02:13:28.700 --> 02:13:31.336
ENROLLMENT GROWTH. IN AN

02:13:31.403 --> 02:13:33.071
BEGINNING JULY FIRST WE'VE

02:13:33.138 --> 02:13:34.039

WOULD ELSE THAT. THE

02:42:49.960 --> 02:42:52.696
ADMINISTRATION RECONSIDER- THEY

02:42:52.762 --> 02:42:54.364
ARE ABSOLUTELY DESERVING OF

02:42:54.431 --> 02:42:56.433
INCREASES BECAUSE OF THEIR

02:42:56.500 --> 02:42:59.436
GREAT SUCCESS WITH OUR STUDENTS.

02:42:59.503 --> 02:43:01.838

02:43:07.477 --> 02:43:10.780
NEEDS CENTERS AND COORDINATORS.

02:43:10.847 --> 02:43:13.517

HUNDRED SIXTEEN ONE SIXTEEN

02:43:28.365 --> 02:43:29.833
THEM IF THE TOTAL AMOUNT FOR

02:43:29.900 --> 02:43:32.536
EACH OF THOSE IS UNDER TWO

02:43:32.602 --> 02:43:34.905
HUNDRED AND SIXTY THOUSAND IS

02:43:34.971 --> 02:43:39.142
THAT ENOUGH. THANK YOU YES

02:43:39.209 --> 02:43:40.877

REALLY ISN'T ENOUGH IN TERMS OF

02:43:44.314 --> 02:43:47.817
THE CASE MANAGED APPROACH AND

02:43:47.884 --> 02:43:49.553
ONE THAT CAN HOLISTICALLY

02:43:49.619 --> 02:43:51.188
SUPPORT EVERY STUDENT WE HAVE

02:43:51.254 --> 02:43:54.257
CAMPUSES THAT HAVE AS MANY AS

02:43:54.324 --> 02:43:55.158
TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND STUDENTS.

02:43:55.225 --> 02:43:56.793
DO YOU CAN ENVISIONED HOW

02:43:56.860 --> 02:43:58.695
CHALLENGING IT CAN BE FOR ONE

02:43:58.762 --> 02:44:00.664
PERSON TO HANDLE THE NEEDS OF

02:44:00.730 --> 02:44:03.266
EVEN HALF OF THAT POPULATION

02:44:03.333 --> 02:44:05.168
WITH A MORE INTEGRATED STRATEGY

02:44:05.235 --> 02:44:07.137
THAT HAS BASIC NEEDS AT THE

02:44:07.204 --> 02:44:10.106
CORE- AND STILL BRINGS ON OF

02:44:10.173 --> 02:44:11.174
THE BASIC NEEDS COORDINATOR TO

02:44:11.241 --> 02:44:14.444
DERIVE THAT WORK- WE THINK THAT

02:44:14.511 --> 02:44:15.745
WE CAN SERVE MORE STUDENTS TO

02:44:15.812 --> 02:44:17.380

STRETCH. SAVES ARE AN ESTIMATED

02:47:06.683 --> 02:47:08.084

02:47:11.755 --> 02:47:14.524
OTHER RECKON- IS REFLECTED IN

02:47:14.591 --> 02:47:16.059
THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSED

02:47:16.126 --> 02:47:18.928
LOOK AT SOME OF THE BEES

02:47:18.995 --> 02:47:20.730
PATHWAYS ARE CAN'T COMPLETELY.

02:47:20.797 --> 02:47:22.932
ZERO TEXTBOOK COST BECAUSE

02:47:22.999 --> 02:47:25.068
THEIR ROYALTIES ASSOCIATED. AND

SOME WILL HAVE TO BE LOW COST

02:47:31.441 --> 02:47:35.445
EFFORTS- WE ALSO CONTINUED TO

02:47:35.512 --> 02:47:38.148
HEAR FROM OUR STUDENTS. THAT

02:47:38.214 --> 02:47:40.049
TEXTBOOK COSTS CONTINUE TO BE A

02:47:40.116 --> 02:47:42.051
KEY DRIVER TO SOME OF THEIR

02:47:42.118 --> 02:47:43.953
AFFORDABILITY CHALLENGES SO WE

02:47:44.020 --> 02:47:45.655
DO THINK THAT THIS DESERVES A

02:47:45.722 --> 02:47:49.225
LOT OF MERIT- THEY- THEY

02:47:49.292 --> 02:47:51.261
INVESTMENTS WOULD COVER NOT

02:47:51.327 --> 02:47:58.301
ONLY. AT DEVELOPING THESE OUT

02:47:58.368 --> 02:47:59.769
COURSE IS PRO. BUT IT ALSO WILL

02:47:59.836 --> 02:48:02.672
COVER. THE FACT TIME DEVELOP

02:48:02.739 --> 02:48:04.541
THESE TWO- I DON'T KNOW. QUAN

02:48:04.607 --> 02:48:07.310
RESEARCH. INCIDENT THAT ARE ARE

02:48:07.377 --> 02:48:08.645
USED AND TO DELIVER THE SAME

02:48:08.711 --> 02:48:12.549
AND THEY WOULD GET FROM-

02:48:12.615 --> 02:48:14.284
EXISTING TEXTBOOKS. TERRA

02:48:14.350 --> 02:48:18.288

DID WANT TO RESPOND TO THE

02:48:25.195 --> 02:48:27.730
QUESTION AND ALSO TO WHAT YOU

02:48:27.797 --> 02:48:29.299
JUST HEARD FROM MISS NAVARETTE

02:48:29.365 --> 02:48:32.702
SO THE REPORT- DID ARRIVE IT

02:48:32.769 --> 02:48:36.306
WAS THE LAST MONTH IT WAS- BY

02:48:36.372 --> 02:48:38.608
YEAR AND A HALF LATE AND IT-

02:48:38.675 --> 02:48:41.678
TALKED ABOUT HOW THE MONEY FROM

02:48:41.744 --> 02:48:42.745
THE SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN

02:48:42.812 --> 02:48:44.948
INITIATIVE I WAS SPENT AND WHAT

02:48:45.014 --> 02:48:47.817
THE RESULTS ARE- WHEN YOU READ

02:48:47.884 --> 02:48:50.019
THE REPORT I THINK IT'S FAIR TO

02:48:50.086 --> 02:48:51.754
SAY YOU'LL BE KIND OF

02:48:51.821 --> 02:48:53.356
DISAPPOINTED THERE WASN'T A LOT

02:48:53.423 --> 02:48:54.357
OF INFORMATION THERE IT SEEMS

02:48:54.424 --> 02:48:55.558
TO BE THERE SOME DATA

02:48:55.625 --> 02:48:58.161
COLLECTION ISSUES. WITH THAT

02:48:58.228 --> 02:48:59.128
THE REPORT DOES MENTION THAT

02:48:59.195 --> 02:49:01.898
BUT- DON'T WANT TO BELABOR THAT

02:49:01.965 --> 02:49:03.633
JUST WANT O POINT OUT THAT THE

02:49:03.700 --> 02:49:05.068
LEGISLATURE AFTER ALL THIS TIME

02:49:05.134 --> 02:49:07.136
STILL LAKES LACKS BASIC

02:49:07.203 --> 02:49:08.972
INFORMATION ON HOW THAT FIRST

02:49:09.038 --> 02:49:09.873
INITIATIVE WHEN WE DON'T KNOW

02:49:09.939 --> 02:49:11.941
AT THIS POINT THE EXTENT TO

02:49:12.008 --> 02:49:14.878
WHICH FACULTY- HAVE ACTUALLY

02:49:14.944 --> 02:49:16.946
CHOSEN TO USE THESE MATERIALS

02:49:17.013 --> 02:49:17.780
THAT WERE TRADED WITH THIS

02:49:17.847 --> 02:49:18.715
MONEY YOU KNOW THEY HAVE

02:49:18.781 --> 02:49:20.250
ACADEMIC FREEDOM THEY CAN

02:49:20.316 --> 02:49:21.384
DECIDE WHETHER THEY WANT TO USE

02:49:21.451 --> 02:49:23.486
OPEN RESOURCE- OPEN EDUCATION

02:49:23.553 --> 02:49:25.755
RESOURCES OVER CHARGE THE OLD

YOU KNOW HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLAR

02:49:26.656 --> 02:49:28.358
TEXTBOOK LIKE THEY ALWAYS HAVE

02:49:28.424 --> 02:49:29.659
WE DON'T KNOW IF FACULTY

02:49:29.726 --> 02:49:31.995
ACTUALLY USING. THESE RESOURCES

02:49:32.061 --> 02:49:32.662
IN THESE PATHWAYS WE DON'T KNOW

02:49:32.729 --> 02:49:34.631
HOW MANY STUDENTS ACTUALLY

02:49:34.697 --> 02:49:36.399
COMPLETED EIGHT ZERO TEXTBOOK

02:49:36.466 --> 02:49:38.468
COST DEGREE OF DEGREE OR

02:49:38.535 --> 02:49:40.303
PATHWAY WERE ON TRACK TO DO ONE

02:49:40.370 --> 02:49:41.437
WE DON'T KNOW HOW THEY

02:49:41.504 --> 02:49:43.306
PERFORMED ACADEMICALLY- WE

02:49:43.373 --> 02:49:44.274
DON'T KNOW WHAT CHALLENGES WERE

02:49:44.340 --> 02:49:46.009
ENCOUNTERED BY GRANTEES YOU

02:49:46.075 --> 02:49:47.210
KNOW THAT THE COLLEGES THAT GOT

02:49:47.277 --> 02:49:49.712
THIS MONEY IN DEVELOPING THESE-

02:49:49.779 --> 02:49:51.948
THESE PATHWAYS AND IF YOU LOOK

02:49:52.015 --> 02:49:53.049
AT THE REPORT WE ACTUALLY THE

02:49:53.116 --> 02:49:54.350
REPORT DOES NOT LAY OUT HOW

02:49:54.417 --> 02:49:55.852
MUCH SAVINGS WERE GENERATED WE

02:49:55.919 --> 02:49:59.222
DO KNOW THAT. STUDENTS SPEND A

02:49:59.289 --> 02:49:59.923
CERTAIN AMOUNT OF MONEY PER

02:49:59.989 --> 02:50:08.097
YEAR ON. AVERAGE ON TEXTBOOKS

02:50:08.164 --> 02:50:10.833
WE DON'T KNOW. OVER HOW THESE

02:50:10.900 --> 02:50:11.901
TWO. SAVED MY AWAY TO SAVE

02:50:11.968 --> 02:50:13.436
MONEY SO. AFTER ALL THIS TIME

02:50:13.503 --> 02:50:15.872
THE LARGEST STILL HAVE ANSWERS

02:50:15.939 --> 02:50:17.173
TO VERY BASED QUESTION SO WE'RE

03:12:20.662 --> 03:12:22.330
DEMONSTRATED NEED. IF THIS IS

03:12:22.397 --> 03:12:23.798
AN AREA THAT THE LEGISLATURE

03:12:23.865 --> 03:12:25.533
WOULD LIKE TO PURSUE. WE

03:12:25.600 --> 03:12:27.068
RECOMMEND A FEW MODIFICATIONS

03:12:27.135 --> 03:12:29.337
TO THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. FOR

03:12:29.404 --> 03:12:31.907
EXAMPLE WE RECOMMEND- NARROWING

03:12:31.973 --> 03:12:33.141
THE SCOPE OF THE GRANTS TO

03:12:33.208 --> 03:12:35.844
FOCUS ON. ON A MORE LIMITED

03:12:35.911 --> 03:12:37.145
AMOUNT OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE

03:12:37.212 --> 03:12:39.948
SUCH AS A CAPITAL PROJECT YOUR

03:12:40.015 --> 03:12:40.815
DEFERRED MAINTENANCE. WE

03:12:40.882 --> 03:12:42.083
RECOMMEND THAT BECAUSE YOU'LL

03:12:42.150 --> 03:12:43.385
SEE AN AGENDA THAT THERE ARE

03:12:43.451 --> 03:12:45.253
OTHER PROPOSALS RELATED TO OUR

03:12:45.320 --> 03:12:47.222
BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE. AND

03:12:47.289 --> 03:12:48.723
WE JUST RECOMMEND ENSURING THAT

03:12:48.790 --> 03:12:49.424
THERE ARE MULTIPLE GRANT

03:12:49.491 --> 03:12:51.359
PROGRAMS IF THEY DON'T PEOPLE

03:12:51.426 --> 03:12:53.828
KIDNAPPERS. WELL WE ALSO KNOW

03:12:53.895 --> 03:12:55.263
THAT THERE WERE A FEW PROPOSALS

03:12:55.330 --> 03:12:56.331
WE ARE RECOMMENDING THE

03:12:56.398 --> 03:12:58.633
LEGISLATURE. UP FOR EXAMPLE

03:12:58.700 --> 03:13:00.735
YOU'LL SEE PROPOSALS RELATED TO

03:13:00.802 --> 03:13:02.203
ENGLISH AS A SECOND LANGUAGE

03:13:02.270 --> 03:13:05.206
INSTRUCTION AND- ONLINE

03:13:05.273 --> 03:13:06.174
TUTORING FOR K. TWELVE

03:13:06.241 --> 03:13:08.643
STUDENTS. WE THINK THESE ARE

03:13:08.710 --> 03:13:10.412
PROPOSALS LARGELY DUPLICATE.

03:13:10.478 --> 03:13:11.880
ACTIVITIES THAT ARE GOING ON AT

03:13:11.947 --> 03:13:13.248
SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES

03:13:13.315 --> 03:13:14.549
STATE PROVIDES BILLIONS OF

03:13:14.616 --> 03:13:15.350
DOLLARS SHOULD BE BECAUSE

03:13:15.417 --> 03:13:16.751
ACTIVITIES. WE DON'T SEE A

03:13:16.818 --> 03:13:18.620
RATIONALE AND PROVIDING AN

03:13:18.687 --> 03:13:20.088
ADDITIONAL SET ASIDE ABOUT FROM

03:13:20.155 --> 03:13:23.892
FOR LIBRARIES. TO CONDUCTION.

03:13:23.959 --> 03:13:26.227
IT'S I REALIZED IS ONE OF SO ON

03:13:26.294 --> 03:13:29.531
HAPPY THAT ON THE DURING. OKAY

03:13:29.597 --> 03:13:32.100
THANK YOU. STATE LIBRARIAN

03:13:32.167 --> 03:13:35.971
MISTER LUCAS. HI GREG LOCUSTS

03:13:36.037 --> 03:13:37.939
CALIFORNIA STATE LIBRARY I'M

03:13:38.006 --> 03:13:40.976
HAPPY TO ANSWER- ANY QUESTIONS

03:13:41.042 --> 03:13:43.745
THE SUBCOMMITTEE HANDS- I WOULD

03:13:43.812 --> 03:13:47.015
I WOULD POINT OUT THAT THE- THE

03:13:47.082 --> 03:13:48.717
SURVEY THAT JASON WAS TALKING

03:13:48.783 --> 03:13:50.552
ABOUT OF LIBRARY FACILITIES

03:13:50.618 --> 03:13:51.987
FINDS A THREE POINT EIGHT

03:13:52.053 --> 03:13:54.356
BILLION DOLLAR NEED- FROM

03:13:54.422 --> 03:13:57.592
RESPONDENTS WHO REPRESENT 70%

03:13:57.659 --> 03:13:59.928
OF THE LIBRARY FACILITIES SO IF

03:13:59.995 --> 03:14:02.063
YOU SORT OF EXTRAPOLATE THAT

03:14:02.130 --> 03:14:04.733
OUT THE RENOVATION AND

03:14:04.799 --> 03:14:08.236
MODERNIZATION NEEDS CLOSER TO

03:14:08.303 --> 03:14:09.504
ABOUT. FIVE BILLION DOLLARS. SO

03:14:09.571 --> 03:14:13.908
IS IT IS THIS TO PROVIDE MORE

03:14:13.975 --> 03:14:16.778
LIBRARY SERVICES OR MODERNIZE

03:14:16.845 --> 03:14:18.546
AND UPGRADE EXISTING BECAUSE IT

03:14:18.613 --> 03:14:21.649
SEEMS THAT WE HAVE. DEUL NEEDS

03:14:21.716 --> 03:14:24.019
IN OUR STATE WIDE LIBRARY

03:14:24.085 --> 03:14:26.921
FACETTI. WELL THAT'S TRUE THERE

03:14:26.988 --> 03:14:28.923
THERE ARE THE INTENT OF THESE

03:14:28.990 --> 03:14:30.725
BONDS ARE TO MAKE FACILITY

03:14:30.792 --> 03:14:32.093
IMPROVEMENTS HAVE THE LIBRARIES

03:14:32.160 --> 03:14:34.062
IN CALIFORNIA OR FORTY YEARS OF

03:14:34.129 --> 03:14:36.131
AGE OR OLDR SO THAT MEANS

03:14:36.197 --> 03:14:37.832
THEY'RE NOT AS ENERGY EFFICIENT

03:14:37.899 --> 03:14:40.135
AS THEY COULD AND SHOULD BE-

03:14:40.201 --> 03:14:41.236
THAT MEANS MANY ARE

03:14:41.302 --> 03:14:42.670
GRANDFATHERED IN UNDER THE

03:14:42.737 --> 03:14:44.939
AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT

03:14:45.006 --> 03:14:47.542
IT MEANS THAT MANY HAVE WIRING

03:14:47.609 --> 03:14:50.011
THAT INADEQUATE TO DELIVER THE

03:14:50.078 --> 03:14:52.447
KIND OF HIGH SPEED- BROADBAND

03:14:52.514 --> 03:14:54.682
CONNECTIVITY THAT'S- BOTH

03:14:54.749 --> 03:14:57.419
EXPECTED THE NEEDED BY

03:14:57.485 --> 03:14:57.952
COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE

03:14:58.019 --> 03:15:04.359
STATE. OKAY AT. QUESTIONS FROM

03:15:04.426 --> 03:15:12.400
COMMITTEE MEMBERS. SIX ZERO

03:15:12.467 --> 03:15:13.902
NINE I YEAH MISTER GALLAGHER.

03:15:13.968 --> 03:15:19.941
AS A QUESTION. SO ON THE

03:15:20.008 --> 03:15:21.342
BUSINESS THIRTY FIVE MILLION

03:15:21.409 --> 03:15:22.644
FOR COLLABORATIVE PARTNERSHIPS

03:15:22.710 --> 03:15:24.379
BETWEEN LOCAL EDUCATION

03:15:24.446 --> 03:15:26.114
LIBRARIES AND TELEHEALTH

03:15:26.181 --> 03:15:27.782
PROVIDERS TO EXPAND INTERNET

03:15:27.849 --> 03:15:30.685
ACCESS TO ISOLATED COMMUNITIES

03:15:30.752 --> 03:15:31.519
OBVIOUSLY THAT'S AN IMPORTANT

03:15:31.586 --> 03:15:34.289
ISSUE- BUT THE L. A- INDICATES

03:15:34.355 --> 03:15:36.591
THAT KEY INFORMATION IS MISSING

03:15:36.658 --> 03:15:39.060
FROM THIS PROPOSAL- CAN THE

03:15:39.127 --> 03:15:40.662
ADMINISTRATION SPEAK TO HOW

03:15:40.728 --> 03:15:41.629
INTERNET ACCESS WOULD BE

03:15:41.696 --> 03:15:45.033
EXPANDED- HOW MUCH ADDITIONAL

03:15:45.100 --> 03:15:46.601
FEDERAL FUNDING THE STATE WOULD

03:15:46.668 --> 03:15:50.538
RECEIVE. AND WHAT THE BALANCE

03:15:50.605 --> 03:15:52.040
OF STATE ANOTHER FUNDS WOULD BE

03:15:52.107 --> 03:15:53.641
TO ACCOMPLISH- THESE

03:15:53.708 --> 03:15:56.010
COLLABORATIVE PROJECTS. BUT

03:15:56.077 --> 03:15:58.646
IT'S CRITICAL SO I CAN TAKE A

03:15:58.713 --> 03:16:03.985
STAB AT THAT- TELL A PROBABLY

03:16:04.052 --> 03:16:05.086
TELL ME WHAT YOU KNOW ALREADY

03:16:05.153 --> 03:16:06.688
ABOUT THE FEDERAL E. RATE

03:16:06.754 --> 03:16:08.690
PROGRAM WHICH OFFERS DISCOUNTS

03:16:08.756 --> 03:16:11.459
BOTH IN THE AMOUNT OF MONEY

03:16:11.526 --> 03:16:13.895
THAT LIBRARIES AND SCHOOLS AND

03:16:13.962 --> 03:16:16.631
OTHERS PAY. FOR THEIR INTERNET

03:16:16.698 --> 03:16:20.068
CONNECTIVITY- AND IT'S THE

03:16:20.135 --> 03:16:21.569
RIGHT THE DISCOUNT IS BASED ON

03:16:21.636 --> 03:16:24.005
THE NUMBER OF SUBSIDIZED MEALS

03:16:24.072 --> 03:16:25.240
THAT ARE SERVED AT SCHOOLS IN

03:16:25.306 --> 03:16:26.975
THE SAME JURISDICTION SO

03:16:27.041 --> 03:16:28.309
THERE'S PARTS OF THE STATE YOU

03:16:28.376 --> 03:16:34.115
KNOW SOME SOME YOUR DISTRICT-

03:16:34.182 --> 03:16:36.818
WHERE. FOR PROVIDERS ARE

03:16:36.885 --> 03:16:38.720
BIDDING ON THE PROJECTS BECAUSE

03:16:38.786 --> 03:16:40.555
CONNECTING THE AREAS IS SO

03:16:40.622 --> 03:16:43.791
EXPENSIVE. ADD THAT TO DO WANT

03:16:43.858 --> 03:16:45.293
TO ACCOMPLISH IN TO THE REVENUE

03:16:45.360 --> 03:16:48.329
THAT THEY'LL GET BACK- DOESN'T

03:16:48.396 --> 03:16:49.230
COVER THE EXPENSE OF THEIR

03:16:49.297 --> 03:16:51.799
INVESTMENT. SO WE'VE HAD SOME

03:16:51.866 --> 03:16:53.968
SUCCESS LAST YEAR WORKING WITH

03:16:54.035 --> 03:16:56.638
OUR PARTNERS- AT THE DEPARTMENT

03:16:56.704 --> 03:16:59.841
OF EDUCATION. AND TWO PROJECTS

03:16:59.908 --> 03:17:01.709
AT THE SAME TIME RIGHT SO A

03:17:01.776 --> 03:17:04.846
LIBRARY PLUS A SCHOOL PROJECT

03:17:04.913 --> 03:17:07.248
AND SO THAT BRINGS INTO PLAY TO

03:17:07.315 --> 03:17:09.250
E. RATE DISCOUNTS. AND THEN THE

03:17:09.317 --> 03:17:11.619
LIBRARIES USED- THERE'S I

03:17:11.686 --> 03:17:13.188
FORGOT THE NAME OF BUT IT'S ON

03:17:13.254 --> 03:17:15.390
THERE THERE'S A- WE HAVE A SIX

03:17:15.456 --> 03:17:16.991
MILLION DOLLAR POT OF MONEY FOR

03:17:17.058 --> 03:17:19.260
BROADBAND GRANTS. AND SO WE'VE

03:17:19.327 --> 03:17:21.362
BEEN USING FUNDS FROM BACK TO

03:17:21.429 --> 03:17:24.399
MAKE A TO MAKE THE STATE MATCH

03:17:24.465 --> 03:17:28.870
WHICH ALSO TRIGGERS- YEAH KIND

03:17:28.937 --> 03:17:30.638
OF A REDUCTION IN COST BY THE

03:17:30.705 --> 03:17:33.308
FEDS. BUT AT LEAST LAST YEAR ON

03:17:33.374 --> 03:17:35.176
THE PROJECTS WE DID WAS RUNNING

03:17:35.243 --> 03:17:39.013
AT A ONE DOLLAR FROM US. TEN

03:17:39.080 --> 03:17:39.681
DOLLARS BACK FROM THE FEDS

03:17:39.747 --> 03:17:42.350
RATIO. SO THIS THIRTY FIVE

03:17:42.417 --> 03:17:43.818
MILLION CONTEMPLATES TAKING

03:17:43.885 --> 03:17:44.919
THAT AND SO WE'VE HAD SOME

03:17:44.986 --> 03:17:49.157
SUCCESS LIKE FERNDALE AND-

03:17:49.224 --> 03:17:51.526
SHOOT WHAT'S OUT GARBER VILLE-

03:17:51.593 --> 03:17:53.761
WERE PROJECTS THAT IS. NOBODY

03:17:53.828 --> 03:17:54.963
IN THAT ON BECAUSE THEY WERE SO

03:17:55.029 --> 03:17:56.664
EXPENSIVE BUT MATT WAS ONE OF

03:17:56.731 --> 03:17:59.000
THE SUCCESSES LAST YEAR. ALSO

03:17:59.067 --> 03:18:01.169
JUST NEAR HERE IN SACRAMENTO-

03:18:01.236 --> 03:18:02.870
CLARKSBURG FOR EXAMPLE

03:18:02.937 --> 03:18:05.206
CONNECTING THE LIBRARY AND-

03:18:05.273 --> 03:18:08.042
ONCE ITS HIGH SCHOOL THERE- BUT

03:18:08.109 --> 03:18:10.445
THOSE WERE TWO SUCCESSES THAT

03:18:10.511 --> 03:18:12.380
CAME FROM THIS BUILDING. TO

03:18:12.447 --> 03:18:13.648
KINDS OF PROJECTS AT THE SAME

03:18:13.715 --> 03:18:16.517
TIME SO THAT THE INTENT OF THE

03:18:16.584 --> 03:18:17.518
THIRTY FIVE MILLION IS TO SAY

03:18:17.585 --> 03:18:22.490
OKAY. WELL LET'S DO. LIVE PLUS.

03:18:22.557 --> 03:18:25.159
PLUS TELEHEALTH WHICH TRIGGERS

03:18:25.226 --> 03:18:28.062
A THIRD- EAT AS I UNDERSTAND IT

03:18:28.129 --> 03:18:29.197
THIRTY RATE DISCOUNT OF MAIN

03:18:29.264 --> 03:18:31.766
BREAKS- EVEN MORE PROJECTS MORE

03:18:31.833 --> 03:18:36.638
ATTRACTIVE TO- PROVIDERS. CAN I

03:18:36.704 --> 03:18:38.206
ANY BETTER WAY TO LEVERAGE

03:18:38.273 --> 03:18:40.475
THOSE ALL THOSE DOLLARS THOSE

03:18:40.541 --> 03:18:43.511
POTS OF MONEY TO GET. SOME

03:18:43.578 --> 03:18:44.912
BROADBAND INCREASE IN THESE

03:18:44.979 --> 03:18:52.220
AREAS. YES. YOU KNOW IF THERE'S

03:18:52.287 --> 03:18:54.455

SOLELY- I WE REALIZE TIME IS

03:29:50.778 --> 03:29:51.612
SHORT SO WE WERE JUST GOING TO

03:29:51.679 --> 03:29:53.647
FOCUS ON THE TWO BIG ITEMS YET

ON THE STUDENT HOUSING PROPOSAL

03:30:04.858 --> 03:30:05.526
WE'RE STILL WAITING ON THE

03:30:05.592 --> 03:30:06.961
TRAILER BILL LEGISLATION THE

03:30:07.027 --> 03:30:07.962
ADMINISTRATION HASN'T RELEASED

03:30:08.028 --> 03:30:09.797
IT YET- SO WE CAN'T OFFER

TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AT THE

03:30:11.065 --> 03:30:12.967
MOMENT BOB BUT WE DO WANT TO

03:30:13.033 --> 03:30:14.101
RAISE A FEW ISSUES ISSUES FOR

03:30:14.168 --> 03:30:18.105
LEGISLATORS LEGISLATURES.

03:30:18.172 --> 03:30:19.206
FACTOR TO CONSIDER ON THIS ONE-

03:30:19.273 --> 03:30:20.307
COME ON THIS WOULD BE. OUR ONLY

03:30:20.374 --> 03:30:21.175
A NEW INITIATIVE REALLY IN

03:30:21.241 --> 03:30:22.710
APPROACH FOR THE STATE.

03:30:22.776 --> 03:30:23.911
HISTORICAL TO THE STATE HAS

03:30:23.978 --> 03:30:25.312
FOCUSED ITS OUR CAPITAL

03:30:25.379 --> 03:30:26.714
RESOURCES ON ACADEMIC

03:30:26.780 --> 03:30:28.949
FACILITIES. MR BE A NEW

03:30:29.016 --> 03:30:30.551
APPROACH BY FOCUSING ON OUR-

03:30:30.617 --> 03:30:32.152
SPENDING ON STUDENT HOUSING.

03:30:32.219 --> 03:30:33.387
IT'S ALSO A NEW APPROACH TO

03:30:33.454 --> 03:30:34.421
ADDRESSING AFFORDABILITY

03:30:34.488 --> 03:30:35.856
HISTORICALLY THE STATE HAS

03:30:35.923 --> 03:30:39.693
FOCUSED ITS SPENT ON SPENDING

03:30:39.760 --> 03:30:40.728
ON TOP FINANCIALLY PROGRAMS.

03:30:40.794 --> 03:30:41.628
HOW BECAUSE THIS IS NEARLY

03:30:41.695 --> 03:30:42.763
RAISES A FEW AREAS OF

03:30:42.830 --> 03:30:44.898
UNCERTAINTY FOR ONE IT'S HARD

03:30:44.965 --> 03:30:47.034
TO GAUGE THE IMPACT OF THE

03:30:47.101 --> 03:30:47.534
PROPOSAL WOULD HAVE ON

03:30:47.601 --> 03:30:49.937
AFFORDABILITY. HAPPENS FOR

03:30:50.004 --> 03:30:51.205
EXAMPLE IT'S HARD TO GAUGE HOW

03:30:51.271 --> 03:30:52.439
MANY ADDITIONAL BEDS WERE

03:30:52.506 --> 03:30:53.974
PROVIDED HOW MANY STUDENTS TO

03:30:54.041 --> 03:30:56.143
BE IMPACTED BY IT. IT'S ALSO

03:30:56.210 --> 03:30:57.344
HARD TO PROJECT- THE

03:30:57.411 --> 03:30:59.179
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROGRAMS

03:30:59.246 --> 03:31:00.714
IT'S HARD TO PROJECT WHETHER.

03:31:00.781 --> 03:31:02.249
CAMPUSES WOULD HAVE THE ABILITY

03:31:02.316 --> 03:31:05.152
TO. IRAN BUT HOUSING ON A

03:31:05.219 --> 03:31:07.488
CERTAIN KIND OF MIND. FINALLY

03:31:07.554 --> 03:31:08.922
IT'S A WANTS TO HOOK HOUSING

03:31:08.989 --> 03:31:10.958
UNITS ARE BILL- DEPENDING ON

03:31:11.025 --> 03:31:11.892
THE TRIM LEGISLATION AND

03:31:11.959 --> 03:31:13.227
DEPENDING ON THE LIMITS THAT

03:31:13.293 --> 03:31:14.795
ARE IMPOSING ON RENTAL RATES.

03:31:14.862 --> 03:31:16.330
IT'S HARD TO GAUGE THE ABILITY

03:31:16.397 --> 03:31:17.831
OF OTHER SEGMENTS MOVING

03:31:17.898 --> 03:31:24.405
FORWARD TO BE ABLE TO. MAINTAIN

03:31:24.471 --> 03:31:25.039
AND OPERATE THE FACILITIES. I'M

03:31:25.105 --> 03:31:27.174
SORRY ABOUT THAT YOU A RESERVE

03:31:27.241 --> 03:31:32.780
FOR THE- COMMENTS. OKAY IN.

03:31:32.846 --> 03:31:34.314
COLLEGE STATING BOTH OVERLAPS

03:31:34.381 --> 03:31:35.949
WAITING PRO ACCOUNT GETS

03:31:36.016 --> 03:31:38.652
PROGRAM WHICH THE STATE END

03:31:38.719 --> 03:31:39.486
NINETEEN TO. UNDERSTANDING

03:31:39.553 --> 03:31:40.320
SCHEDULED TO LAUNCH THIS

03:31:40.387 --> 03:31:41.388
PROGRAM LATER THIS YEAR AND IT

03:31:41.455 --> 03:31:43.323
WILL BE AN ST ACCOUNT EVERY NEW

03:31:43.390 --> 03:31:45.192
KERR BUT IT'S THE OF THESE ON

03:31:45.259 --> 03:31:47.928
FACT THESE. MUCH LITERATURE

03:31:47.995 --> 03:31:49.263
FIVE FUNDING COLLEGE SAVINGS IN

03:31:49.329 --> 03:31:51.031
THE BUDGET GAP WE THINK COULD

03:31:51.098 --> 03:31:51.965
CONSIDER AUGMENTING THE

03:31:52.032 --> 03:31:53.634
EXISTING PROGRAM RATHER THAN

03:31:53.700 --> 03:31:55.369
CREATING A NEW ONE AND HAVING

03:31:55.436 --> 03:31:56.403
ONE COLLEGE SAVINGS ACCOUNT

03:31:56.470 --> 03:31:57.471
COULD BE EASIER FOR FAMILIES TO

03:31:57.538 --> 03:31:58.672
NAVIGATE THAT'S INCREASING

03:31:58.739 --> 03:31:59.807
LIKELY HAD THE BILLING CARE

03:31:59.873 --> 03:32:05.779

ON THESE TO THE LARGER ITEMS.

03:32:20.527 --> 03:32:21.862
WHEN I REALIZED THE OTHER ONE

03:32:21.929 --> 03:32:25.432
WELL- NOT AS LARGE AS TWO

03:32:25.499 --> 03:32:28.035
BILLION IS SIGNIFICANT TWELVE

03:32:28.102 --> 03:32:28.569
THAT CALLS FOR ALL SERVICE

03:32:57.598 --> 03:33:00.467
REVOLVING FUND FOR HIGHER

EDUCATION STUDENT HOUSING IT'S

03:33:02.469 --> 03:33:04.371
A BIG NEED AND FOR THE COST OF

03:33:10.344 --> 03:33:12.412
THE CAMPUS I'M NOT SURE ABOUT

03:33:12.479 --> 03:33:14.781
THE MAJORITY OF IT GOING TO OUR

03:33:14.848 --> 03:33:16.850
COMMUNITY COLLEGES JUST BECAUSE

03:33:16.917 --> 03:33:18.886
TALKING TO THEM LAST YEAR. AND

03:33:18.952 --> 03:33:19.887
THEY'RE THE ONES THAT WERE

03:33:19.953 --> 03:33:21.922
LEAST LIKELY TO ENGAGE IN BILL

03:33:21.989 --> 03:33:23.090
STUDENT HOUSING AND OTHERS A

03:33:23.157 --> 03:33:24.158
COUPLE OF ENTREPRENEURIAL

03:33:24.224 --> 03:33:26.360
CAMPUSES BUT- REALLY IF YOU

03:33:26.426 --> 03:33:28.795

03:33:30.430 --> 03:33:31.532
FOR THE BUCK IT'S THE UC AND

03:33:31.598 --> 03:33:34.635
CSU SEGMENT AND REALLY ADDRESS

03:33:34.701 --> 03:33:35.202
THE OTHER ISSUES WE TALKED

03:33:35.269 --> 03:33:37.905
ABOUT EARLIER WHICH IS

03:33:37.971 --> 03:33:38.939
ENROLLMENT ACCESS. NOT TO SAY

03:33:39.006 --> 03:33:40.741
THAT A STUDENT HOUSING IS AN

03:33:40.807 --> 03:33:41.842
ISSUE WITH OUR COMMUNITY

03:33:41.909 --> 03:33:43.410
COLLEGE STUDENTS BUT JUST DON'T

03:33:43.477 --> 03:33:44.111
THIS DOESN'T SEEM OF THERE'S A

03:33:44.178 --> 03:33:46.113
LOT OF VIABLE. PROJECTS COULD

03:33:46.180 --> 03:33:47.748
THEY COULD JUST GET UP AND

03:33:47.814 --> 03:33:51.451
GOING NOW- YOU KNOW WE CAN TALK

03:33:51.518 --> 03:33:52.019
ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THEY

03:33:52.085 --> 03:33:54.087
SHOULD BE. AREVOLVING LOAN

03:33:54.154 --> 03:33:55.522
FUND- JUST GRANTS TO THE

03:33:55.589 --> 03:33:57.191
SEGMENTS I THINK WE'LL HAVE AN

03:33:57.257 --> 03:33:59.159
OPPORTUNITY TO WHEN IT IS.

03:33:59.226 --> 03:34:00.227
KNOWING THAT WE HAVEN'T SEEN

03:34:00.294 --> 03:34:01.428
THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE AND

03:34:01.495 --> 03:34:05.065
THERE'S A LOT OF IDEAS AND- AND

03:34:05.132 --> 03:34:06.366
REALLY SOME THOUGHTS ABOUT HOW

03:34:06.433 --> 03:34:07.668
TO DO THIS I THINK THIS IS.

03:34:07.734 --> 03:34:09.036
LIKE WE SAID EARLIER AN

03:34:09.102 --> 03:34:10.070
OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE SURE WE

03:34:10.137 --> 03:34:11.705
JUST DON'T GO FAST BUT DO IT

03:34:11.772 --> 03:34:13.207
RIGHT AND REALLY BE THOUGHTFUL

03:34:13.273 --> 03:34:14.875
AND DELIBERATIVE TO MAKE SURE

03:34:14.942 --> 03:34:17.878
THAT. WE FOCUS ON STUFF NASA

03:34:17.945 --> 03:34:20.347
FOR BILLION. IN INVESTMENT TO

03:34:20.414 --> 03:34:22.282
MAKE SURE THAT WE- WE GET OUR

03:34:22.349 --> 03:34:23.150
BIGGEST BANG FOR A BUCK AND

03:34:23.217 --> 03:34:26.220
REALLY. FAT HE ENSURE THAT. YES

03:34:26.286 --> 03:34:27.087
TO HOUSING ANSWER ACTUALLY

03:34:27.154 --> 03:34:29.523
BUILT. AND THEY'RE PERSONALLY

03:34:29.590 --> 03:34:33.594
AFFORDABLE AND LASTLY. WE THINK

03:34:33.660 --> 03:34:36.330
THAT IT'S- IT'S IN THE BEST

03:34:36.396 --> 03:34:37.531
INTERESTS OF TAXPAYERS TO HAVE

03:34:37.598 --> 03:34:41.368
THESE- UNIVERSITY BELTS. AND

03:34:41.435 --> 03:34:43.070
NOT BRING IN IN. THE PRIVATE

03:34:43.136 --> 03:34:44.304
SECTOR FOR THESE YOU KNOW

03:34:44.371 --> 03:34:45.739
PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS

03:34:45.806 --> 03:34:47.441
THEY KNOW THEY THEY SOUND GOOD

03:34:47.507 --> 03:34:50.143
BUT MANY TIMES ARE JUST. WALL

03:34:50.210 --> 03:34:50.944
STREET INVESTORS TRYING TO GET

03:34:51.011 --> 03:34:53.280
THERE. THERE ARE A WIDE ON

03:34:53.347 --> 03:34:55.082
THESE RATES AND SO YOU KNOW WE

03:34:55.148 --> 03:34:56.316
WANT TO MAKE SURE WE KEEP THE

03:34:56.383 --> 03:34:58.118
PRICES DOWN FOR COLLEGE

03:34:58.185 --> 03:34:59.786
STUDENTS. LIKE WE'VE SEEN IN.

03:34:59.853 --> 03:35:01.622
UNIVERSITY HOUSING THE UC UC

03:35:01.688 --> 03:35:03.390

03:36:35.449 --> 03:36:38.085
QUESTIONS ON HOW THIS IS

03:36:38.151 --> 03:36:39.720

INDIVIDUALS WITH CALLS ACCOUNTS

03:37:20.660 --> 03:37:23.997

IT JUST IT ARE WE LOOKING AT A

03:37:26.466 --> 03:37:28.835
FROM A HOLISTIC PERSPECTIVE AND

03:37:28.902 --> 03:37:32.272
NOT YOU KNOW IF THE CHILD HAS

03:37:32.339 --> 03:37:34.307
EIGHTY COLLEGE ACCOUNT- SAVINGS

03:37:37.744 --> 03:37:39.279
THEIR LIFE THAT IS ENGAGED AND

03:37:39.346 --> 03:37:41.014
CONTINUALLY MOVING THEM FOR

03:37:41.081 --> 03:37:42.416
EXAMPLE RATHER THAN IT JUST

03:37:42.482 --> 03:37:43.784
BEING A REALLY YOU KNOW BASIC

03:37:43.850 --> 03:37:45.085

I'LL TRY TO ANSWER ALL OF THEM-

03:38:01.168 --> 03:38:03.670
SO ON THE FIRST POINT OF LIKE

03:38:03.737 --> 03:38:05.806
SAY WE ARE THINKING ON THE

03:38:05.872 --> 03:38:06.773
CHANGE IN THE MINDSET OF THE

03:38:06.840 --> 03:38:08.875
STUDENT ONE STUDENT KNOWS THAT

03:38:08.942 --> 03:38:10.544
THERE ARE SOME MONEY SAVED FOR

03:38:10.610 --> 03:38:12.245
AT THE FOR THE INDIVIDUAL TO GO

03:38:12.312 --> 03:38:14.047
TO COLLEGE THERE IS A CHANGED.

03:38:14.114 --> 03:38:16.149
ARE WE ARE LOOKING AND HOW A

03:38:16.216 --> 03:38:17.918
LOT OF THE STUDENTS WHO WILL BE

03:38:17.984 --> 03:38:20.921
LOW INCOME- MAYBE THEIR PARENTS

03:38:20.987 --> 03:38:21.621
EXACTLY THEY DID NOT ATTEND

03:38:21.688 --> 03:38:23.657
COLLEGE THEY MAY NOT EVEN HAVE

03:38:23.723 --> 03:38:25.992
A CHECKING ACCOUNT. BUT THAT

03:38:26.059 --> 03:38:28.428
THE MINDSET OF THE STUDENT

03:38:28.495 --> 03:38:29.663
KNOWING THAT THERE'S MONEY SAVE

03:38:29.729 --> 03:38:30.864
FOR THAT INDIVIDUAL IS GOING TO

03:38:30.931 --> 03:38:33.166
COLLEGE HAS A BIG IMPACT AND

03:38:33.233 --> 03:38:34.234
WE'RE LOOKING INTO THE

03:38:34.301 --> 03:38:35.769
INTERGENERATIONAL POVERTY

03:38:35.836 --> 03:38:38.572
REDUCTION AS A WAY TO START IN

03:38:38.638 --> 03:38:41.541
AN EARLY AGE- I THINK ONE OF

03:38:41.608 --> 03:38:42.809
YOUR OTHER QUESTION ONE AS TO

03:38:42.876 --> 03:38:43.777
WHAT HAPPENED IF THE STUDENT

03:38:43.844 --> 03:38:46.179
DOESN'T ATTEND COLLEGE- THE

03:38:46.246 --> 03:38:48.048
CURRENT TRAILER BILL INDICATES

03:38:48.114 --> 03:38:50.083
THAT. THE STUDENT HAS UNTIL IT

03:38:50.150 --> 03:38:55.789
TURNS THIRTY FIVE YEARS. OLD TO

03:38:55.856 --> 03:38:56.690
USE THAT SPACE. IF THEY DON'T

03:38:56.756 --> 03:38:57.657

03:38:57.724 --> 03:38:59.960
RIPPLE TO THE FOR. IT WILL USED

03:39:00.026 --> 03:39:00.961

ANY OTHER UP YOU'VE GOT AND SO

03:39:07.534 --> 03:39:10.003
THEN- SO THAT IS THE

03:39:10.070 --> 03:39:12.806
EXPECTATION THAT. WE WILL BE

03:39:12.873 --> 03:39:15.008
OPENING AN ACCOUNT FOR A CHILD

03:39:15.075 --> 03:39:26.052
