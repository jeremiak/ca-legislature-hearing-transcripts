GOOD AFTERNOON AND. WELCOME EVERYBODY. WE HAVE AG THAT GOOD TURNOUT TODAY ONCE AGAIN THIS IS OUR OUR FIFTH HEARING OF THE ASSEMBLY. BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION ON THE SEA AND WERE EXCITED TO BE HERE AT OUR STATE CAPITOL STAY FOR A FIFTH HEARING TALKING ABOUT. THE FINANCING OF THE SEA VIA. SAY THE BILLION DOLLAR QUESTIONER EVEN MORE. YES I KNOW WE WE WE'VE BEEN AROUND THE STATE'S WE HAD OUR FIRST OF COURSE THE HEARING HERE ABOUT A YEAR AGO. AND OUT OF AND IF YOU OTHER CITIES IN OUR PER BACK. OUR NEXT YEAR WILL BE ABOUT LOOKING AT ACCESS ISSUES BUT TODAY WE'RE FOCUSED ON ON. THE FINANCING PIECE OF THAT WE KNOW THAT'S. A CRITICAL COMPONENT THOUGH YOU KNOW THAT MONEY ISN'T EVERYTHING. THE SYSTEMS ARE IMPORTANT WHAT SAM WHAT'S IN THE. IN THE IN THE IN THE SETTING WHETHER IT'S THAT A FAMILY PROVIDER AT CENTER AT SCHOOL DISTRICT. WELL THOSE ARE ALL IMPORTANT COMPONENTS BUT I AM GOING TO MAKE SURE. THAT WE LOOK AT THE ECONOMICS OF OF HOW WE MAKE THIS WORK IN CALIFORNIA SO WE HAVE AN AN EXCITING UP PANEL HERE TODAY I KNOW OUR SPEAKERIS GOING TO BE HER IN A MOMENT TO. TO JOIN US AS WELL. DO HAVE ANY OPENING COMMENTS FOR FROM ANYBODY. YES ASSEMBLY MEMBER RUBIO THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE HERE WITH YOU. I'M I KNOW WE'VE BEEN TAKING A. OUR COMMISSION IN ON THE ROAD SHOW IS WHAT I CALL IT AND I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR US TO. TO GO TO THE DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES AND. HEAR INPUT FROM EVERYONE THAT'S INVOLVED AYE AS. MANY OF YOU KNOW I'M A FORMER TEACHER AND I KNOW I UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION I WITH THE KINDERGARTEN TEACHERS ALL I'D NOBODY KNOWS BETTER THAN THE CAN HARDEN TO JESSE. AND SO I APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION AND I THINK THAT. WITH THE PANEL HERE OF FABULOUS AMAZING PEOPLE I THINK WE CAN. FURTHER UP THE THE MISSION INSTEAD OF JUST HAVING THESE CONVERSATIONS HOPEFULLY AFTER WE HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT FUNDING I THINK WE CAN COME UP WITH SOME GOOD PROCESSES AND PROCEDURES AND. YOU KNOW SOME TANGIBLE OUTCOME SO THAT WE CAN MOVE FORWARD AND REALLY. HAVE OUR COMMUNITIES BE BETTER BECAUSE OF OUR EFFORTS I THINK YOU'VE TO THE A PANEL FOR BEING HERE AND I LOOK FORWARD TO UP A ROBUST. DISCUSSION AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN CONTINUE AND. YOU SOLVE EVERY SINGLE ISSUE. TOMORROW RIGHT SO THANK YOU. OKAY. SO INTERESTS. THANK YOU SO MUCH I ALSO WANT TO WELCOME ALL OF YOU I AM SO GLAD TO BE PART OF THIS COMMISSION. SUCH AN IMPORTANT COMMISSION. IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE ARE PREPARING. FOR THIS IS THE PREPARATION IT'S ALL OUR REPORT THAT WILL PROVIDE THE BLUEPRINT FOR WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IN THE FUTURE. I KNEW WITHOUT A DOUBT OF THIS IS THAT WHAT WE'RE LOOKING LOTS OF CRUCIAL ISSUES. THE ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT HERE RIGHT IT'S NOT THE ONLY ONE. BUT SUCH AN IMPORTANT ONE IS THAT BILLION DOLLAR QUESTION THE BILLION DOLLAR ISSUE. AND MAKING SURE WE DEFINE THE MONEY THAT WE WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE SOME GROUPS HAVE FOUND WAYS TO. TO BRING EVERYBODY TOGETHER AND THAT'S WHAT'S IMPORTANT. SO I'M REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO THE PRESENTATIONS I'M GLAD TO BE PART OF THIS GROUP. OF VERY DISTINGUISHED. CHAMPIONS FOR EARLY CHILDHOOD THAT. ALRIGHT WITH THAT. WITH THAT WE'LL BEGIN BEFORE WE HAVE ARE OUR PANEL TODAY WE WANTED TO. ALLOW. A FEW INDIVIDUALS TO JUST GIVE US A FLAVOR OF OF WHY I PRE QUE IS SO IMPORTANT EARLY EDUCATION FROM. AT THE GROUND LEVEL HERE IN THE CAPITAL CITY OF SACRAMENTO MY HOMETOWN OF COURSE EXCITED SEE MY LOCALS HERE WE HAVE OUR NEW SUPERINTENDENT OF THE SACRAMENTO CITY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT JORGE AG ALLOWED. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US HERE TODAY AND DONNA HOFFMAN. CONAN WHO'S THERE CAMPAIGN DIRECTOR OF EARLY LEARNING FOR MOMS RISING. AND HOPE THAT AREA MAMA TO. PRE CARES AS WELL SO I THINK YOU WILL START WITH THAT YOU JORGE. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US HERE THIS MORNING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND GOOD AFTERNOON TO EVERYONE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY OTHER MEMBERS OF THE STATE LEGISLATURE AND TO EVERY ONE OF OUR COMMISSIONERS. I'M I'M VERY EXCITED TO BE HERE MY NAME IS HOKEY LOT. I'VE THEIR PRIVILEGE IN HONOR OF SERVING AS SUPERINTENDENT OF SACRAMENTO CITY. UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT OUR DISTRICT IS MADE UP OF SEVENTY SEVEN SCHOOLS WITH OVER FORTY SIX THOUSAND STUDENTS. AND WE OPERATE EARLY CHILDHOOD CENTERS AT FORTY FIVE OF THOSE SCHOOLS ARE THOSE ARE. IN THE FORM OF EARLY HEAD START AHEAD STARTS THE PRESCHOOL HEAD START PRESCHOOL. AS WELL AS A STATE SUBSIDIZED AND PHOEBE SCHOOL AGED CHILDREN CENTER. AND ANY COMBINATION THEREOF WE SERVE. ABOUT EIGHTEEN HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THREE STUDENTS SUCH A SHY OF TWO THOUSAND STUDENTS AREN'T AT. A THOSE PROGRAMS. AND I WANNA JUST SPEND A LITTLE BIT OF TIME TALKING ABOUT. SEXY HE'S GUIDING PRINCIPLE WHICH IS THAT. ARE WE ARE DETERMINED TO GIVE EVERY STUDENT AN EQUAL OPPORTUNITY TO GRADUATE. WITH THE GREATEST NUMBER OF POST SECONDARY CHOICES FROM THE WIDEST ARRAY OF OPTIONS. NOW THAT'S A GUIDING PRINCIPLE THAT WE'VE ESTABLISHED IN THAT WE'RE VERY COMMITTED TO AND I WILL BE THE FIRST TO ADMIT THAT THE FOCUS ON POST SECONDARY CHOICES SOMETIMES HAZARDOUS. FOCUSED ON THE BACK END OF OUR CONTINUUM THAT IS HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT WE GRADUATE MORE STUDENTS THAN ARE GRADUATING. AND HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT MORE OF THOSE STUDENTS THAT ARE GRADUATING ARE COMPLETING THE ATG COURSE PATTERN. I'M BUT I'M HERE TO ARGUE. THAT WE HAVE TO SPEND AN EQUAL AMOUNT OF TIME TALKING ABOUT WHAT WE'RE NOT DOING AS EFFECTIVELY ON THE FRONTEND. AND THAT WHAT WE'RE NOT DOING ON THE FRONT AND WE PAY FOR ON THE BACKEND. SO I'D LIKE TO SHARE A LITTLE BIT OF INFORMATION. TO PROVE AT THIS POINT. WE'RE VERY EXCITED. THAT WE HAVE. INITIATED A FULL REDESIGN OF WHAT USED TO BE KNOWN AS OUR SUMMER SCHOOL PROGRAM. SUMMER SCHOOL USE TO BE A PROGRAM THAT WAS AGAIN FOCUSED ON MAKING SURE THAT MORE STUDENTS GRADUATED THOSE THAT WEREN'T ON TRACK TO GRADUATE. NOT BECAUSE WE KNOW THE IMPORTANCE OF CANDOR READINESS. THIRD GRADE READING THIS. TRANSITION YEARS OF SIX TO SEVEN EIGHT TO NINE. A WE HAVE REDESIGNED OUR SUMMER SCHOOL PROGRAM. FOCUSED ON A PHILOSOPHY OF OPTING OUT. WHICH MEANS THAT WE'VE IDENTIFIED. CURRENT CANDOR STUDENTS THAT AREN'T ON TRACK TO DEMONSTRATE CANDOR READINESS. AND WE'VE NOW GONE BACK FURTHER AND IDENTIFIED THOSE STUDENTS WHO ARE STRUGGLING TO DEMONSTRATE CANDOR READINESS WHO DID NOT ATTEND AN EARLY LEARNING PROGRAM. AND ABOUT FIFTY PERCENT OF THE STUDENTS THAT ARE STRUGGLING DID NOT ATTEND AND EARLY LEARNING PROGRAM. NOW. AGAIN. WE COULD CHOOSE TO INVEST THEIR LIMITED RESOURCES WE HAVE. AT THE BACK END TO MAKE SURE MORE STUDENTS GRADUATE BUT WE'VE BEEN DOING THAT FOR MANY MANY YEARS. AND I LIVE ON THE MANTRA THAT EVERY SYSTEM IS PERFECTLY DESIGNED TO GET US THE RESULTS THAT HE GETS. SO WE HAVE TO FUNDAMENTALLY SHIFT THE PARADIGM. FOCUS A GREAT DEAL OF ATTENTION ON THE BACK END BUT BEGIN TO FOCUS MORE ATTENTION ON THE FRONT AND WHICH IS WHY I'M VERY PROUD THAT OUR BOARD OF EDUCATION. HAS FULLY COMMITTED TO FUND A THIS VERY UNIQUE SUMMER SCHOOL PROGRAM THAT WILL SERVE STUDENTS AS EARLY AS KINDERGARTEN WHO ARE NOT ON GRADE LEVEL. GOING INTO FIRST GRADE IN THE FALL. DUFF HOPPED OUT PHILOSOPHY ENTAILS UP THE PRINCIPLE THAT WE HAVE NOW NOTIFIED EVERYONE OF THE PARENTS AND GUARDIANS OF THOSE STUDENTS THAT ARE STRUGGLING AS KINDERGARTENERS. THAT WE'VE ESSENTIALLY PRE REGISTERED THEM FOR SUMMER SCHOOL. AND WE HAVE TO DO RECEIVED AN OPT OUT FORM FROM A PARENT OR GUARDIAN FOR US NOT TO SEE THE STUDENT DURING THE SUMMER. BUT WE ARE CONVINCED AND COMMITTED THAT TO THE EXTENT THAT STUDENTS START THEIR FALL SEMESTER DAY ONE IN THE FALL. CLOSER TO GRADE LEVEL READINESS GOING INTO KINDERGARTEN AND FIRST GRADE. THAT THAT WILL SAVE US. A HUGE AMOUNT OF RESOURCES BOTH HUMAN AND CAPITAL AS THE STUDENTS PROGRESS IN THEIR CAREERS. I ALSO WANT TO MENTION A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT YOU SAID ASSEMBLYMEMBER RADIUS WHICH IS A FUNDING. FUNDING FOR THESE PROGRAMS HAS INCREASED OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS. I IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN ARE THE TOTAL AMOUNT WE INVESTED WAS TWENTY ONE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. SERVE JUST SHY OF TWO THOUSAND STUDENTS IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN IT WAS TWENTY THREE POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS TO SERVE EIGHTEEN HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THREE STUDENTS ABOUT A HUNDRED FEWER STUDENTS. AND IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN WE EXPECT THAT COST TO BE ALMOST TWENTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS IN FACT WE ARE SLATED TO INVEST ABOUT TWO MILLION DOLLARS FROM OUR GENERAL FUND. TO COVER THE DIFFERENCE IN COST. TO RUN THE SAME LEVEL OF PROGRAMMING. NOW WE ALSO KNOW THAT. WE HAVE A WEIGHT LIST. THROUGHOUT SACKS CITY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT AS WELL. ARE AND IT PAINS ME WHEN I LEARNED THAT A STUDENT IS UNABLE BECAUSE OF CAPACITY ISSUES PRIMARILY DUE TO FUNDING. NOT TO ENROLL IN AN EARLY LEARNING PROGRAM GIVEN THE COMMITMENT THAT WE HAVE MADE. TO MAKE SURE THAT STUDENTS ARE DEMONSTRATING CANDOR READINESS FIRST GRADE READINESS AND THIRD GRADE READING CLASS. AND I'LL JUST LEAVE YOU WITH THAT FACT THAT IF FIFTY PERCENT OF OUR STUDENTS WHO ARE STRUGGLING DID NOT ATTEND AN EARLY LEARNING PROGRAM. IN THE URBAN SETTING MOST OF US WOULD CELEBRATE IT FIFTY PERCENT OF OUR STUDENTS COMPLETE THE ATG COURSE PAT. THAT'S A VERY HIGH PERCENTAGE OF STUDENTS STILL WANTING TO. BUT I WOULD MUCH PREFER TO SEE US NOT HIT A PLATEAU IN THAT FIFTY PERCENT. CELEBRATE BECAUSE WE'RE HITTING EIGHTY NINETY PERCENT EIGHTY G. COMPLETION RATES MATCHING OUR GRADUATION RATES AND I BELIEVE THAT WE CAN ACCOMPLISH THAT IF WE INVEST. MUCH MORE HEAVILY ON THE FRONT AND. THANK YOU AGAIN. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THAT PRESENTATION. GREAT THANK YOU SO MUCH SOMEONE NUMBER MCCARTY. AND THANK YOU TO THE COMMISSION FOR INVITING ME HERE TODAY. AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY MENTIONED I AM A LOCAL MOM OF TWO AND MY NAME IS DONNA COLIN AND I'M ALSO CALIFORNIAS CAMPAIGN DIRECTOR FOR EARLY LEARNING. WITH MOMS RAISING WE ARE A MILLION MEMBER GRASSROOTS ORGANIZATION CAMPAIGNING POLICIES. OF THAT STRENGTH AND WOMEN CHILDREN FAMILIES AND OUR ECONOMY WITH ABOUT A HUNDRED THOUSAND MEMBERS HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND AS YOU ALL KNOW HUNDRED THOUSAND IS ANOTHER IMPORTANT NUMBER FOR US HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND IT'S THE NUMBER OF INTO INFANTS AND TODDLERS WHO DON'T HAVE ACCESS. TO HIGH QUALITY EARLY LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES DUE TO FUNDING AND A LACK OF SPACE AND NOT THE REASON WE'RE ALL HERE TODAY. MOMS RAISING IS SO APPRECIATIVE THAT THE BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION WAS FORMED TO STRENGTHEN POLICIES THAT LIFT UP CALIFORNIA'S YOUNGEST LEARNERS. AND WE KNOW THE PARENTS IN THE GOLDEN STATE DESPERATELY NEED A BOOST AND CHANGED ABOUT SUPPORT THEIR CHILDREN. ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE HIGH QUALITY EARLY LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES LIKE CHILDCARE ARE AND PRESCHOOL ARE CRITICAL IN A WINDOW OF TIME WHERE EIGHTY PERCENT OF A CHILD'S BRAIN HAS DEVELOPED. YET IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE A CRISIS OF BOTH ACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY. RIGHT NOW ONLY FOURTEEN PERCENT OF CALIFORNIANS ELIGIBLE INFANTS AND TODDLERS AGES ZERO TO TO HAVE ACCESS TO PUBLIC SUPPORTED AFFORDABLE CHILDCARE OPPORTUNITIES. FORCING THE PARENTS TO MAKE DIFFICULT DECISIONS ABOUT WHERE THEY LEAVE THEIR CHILDREN WHEN THEY GO TO WORK. COMPOUNDING THAT THE PRICE OF INFANT CARE IN CALIFORNIA COSTS FAMILIES MORE THAN IN STATE COLLEGE TUITION. WHICH A BARRIER SO HIGH THAT MANY FAMILIES JUST BASS HORRIBLY CHALLENGING DILEMMAS FOR CARE. AND THE PRICE TAG ON CHILDCARE CARRIES EVEN MORE TROUBLING WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE IMPACT ON LOW INCOME FAMILIES. HEARING HELP CALIFORNIA FOR A FAMILY OF FOUR LIVING NEAR THE POVERTY LEVEL. IT WOULD TAKE NINETY FIVE PERCENT OF THEIR MONTHLY INCOME FOR CHILDCARE FOR TWO. WHICH IS JUST UNACCEPTABLE AND UNATTAINABLE FOR ALL FAMILIES IN CALIFORNIA. AND WITH OVER TWENTY PERCENT OF CALIFORNIA'S KIDS LIVING AT OR NEAR THE POVERTY LEVEL OUR STATE DESPERATELY NEEDS CHANGE. WE STAND AT A MOMENT OF UNMATCHED OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD A SYSTEM THAT SUPPORTS ALL CHILDREN AND FAMILIES AND OUR STATE. WE ALSO KNOW THAT SIXTY PERCENT OF CALIFORNIA'S EARLY LEARNING SPEAK MORE THAN ONE LANGUAGE AT HOME. AND WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO CREATE EARLY LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES THAT WORK AND MEET THE NEEDS FOR ALL OF OUR FAMILIES. INCLUDING ACCESS TO BILL LANGUAGE LEARNING IN THE EARLIEST YEARS. OUR STATE HAS ALWAYS BEEN A BEACON FOR CHANGE AND PROGRESS OFTEN THE EXAMPLE THAT OTHERS POINT TO. YET UNFORTUNATELY OUR COMMITMENT TO OUR YOUNGEST KIDS DOES NOT ALWAYS LEAD THE WAY. EVEN OUR ECONOMY RANKS SIXTH LARGEST IN THE WORLD CALIFORNIA STILL HAS THE SECOND WERE STANDARD OF LIVING FOR CHILDREN IN THE NATION. BUT CALIFORNIA'S GROWING AND STRENGTHENING ECONOMY MEANS THAT IT'S TIME FOR US TO PUT OUR YOUNGEST KIDS FIRST. AND FILL THAT VOID THAT WAS CREATED FOR CHILDCARE FUNDING DURING THE GREAT RECESSION. IT'S ALSO NO SURPRISE THAT HIGH QUALITY EARLY LEARNING PROGRAMS PRODUCE A THIRTEEN PERCENT. YOUR RETURN ON INVESTMENT THROUGH IMPROVED RESULTS IN EDUCATION HEALTH SOCIAL BEHAVIORS AND EMPLOYMENT. I'M HAPPY TO SEE SUCH A PASSIONATE COMMITTEE GROUP OF CHAMPIONS HERE TODAY WITH THE BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION. AND I LOOK FOR TO THE GREAT WORK THAT COMES IN THE NEXT COUPLE YEARS AND THANK YOU AGAIN FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY. THANK YOU AND THANK YOU FOR SETTING THE STAGE THAT WE HAVE A PANEL COMING UP OF A RESEARCHER. PRACTITIONER AND ACADEMIC WE'RE LOOKING FOR HEARING THAT BEFORE THAT WE WENT TO ALLOW. ARAFAT ARE SPEAKER THE ASSEMBLY. WHO TWO YEARS AGO WE WERE PUTTING TOGETHER THIS BUDGET FOR EASY HE THOUGHT YOU KNOW WHAT WE NEED TO STEP UP AND INVEST MORE BUT THINK MORE ABOUT THE LONG TERM? WE CAN DO TO LOOK AT OUR. FRAMEWORK CONSISTENCY IN CALIFORNIA SO A SPEAKER THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND I WANNA OBVIOUSLY THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER CARDIO IN A WELCOME. ALL OF THE COLLEAGUES THE COMMISSIONERS PRESENTERS AND STAKEHOLDERS. WANT TO THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE AND FOR YOUR INTEREST IN THE WORK OF THIS COMMISSION AND FOR YOUR COMMITMENT OBVIOUSLY TOO EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION THERE'S. A A LOT OF FAMILIAR FACES. OUT IN THE THE AUDIENCE I KEVIN I MET. A LONG TIME AGO WHEN WE WERE BOTH WORK IN EARLY CHILDHOOD IT EDUCATION SO IT'S GOOD TO THE IT IT JUST FEELS LIKE HOME. YESTERDAY I SPOKE AT THE TWENTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF FIRST FIVE. AND I NOTED THAT KNOWS TWENTY YEARS FIRST FIVE HAS BEEN ENORMOUS RESOURCE FOR. PARENTS AND POLICY MAKERS HAVE REALLY HELPED SHAPE THE CONVERSATION ABOUT THE VITAL IMPORTANCE OF. ZERO THREE FIVE. IT'S AMAZING HOW FAR ATTITUDES HAVE COME IT'S AMAZING HOW FAR RESEARCH HAS COME NOT ONLY RESEARCH WITH RESPECT TO. TO WHAT WE'VE LEARNED IN THE CLASSROOM. AND SORT OF APPLIED RESEARCH BUT RESEARCH WITH RESPECT TO. THAT BRAIN DEVELOPMENT AND AND ALL THOSE TYPES OF EFFORTS. BUT WE STILL WANT TO DO. ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO FINANCING AND THAT'LL BE OBVIOUSLY THE FOCUS OF TODAY'S HEARING. THIS IS OUR FIFTH HEARING. SINCE I ESTABLISH THE BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION. A YEAR AND A HALF AGO. AND I'M EXCEPTIONALLY PLEASED WITH THE THE HARD WORK OF OF. THIS COMMISSION AND ALL OF ITS MEMBERS. AND I'M EXCITED THAT THE COMMISSION IS ON TRACK TO MAKE SOME IMPORTANT RECOMMENDATIONS TO. THE LEGISLATURE EARLY NEXT YEAR AND THAT THANKS FOR COMING TODAY AND. LET'S GET ON WITH IT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU AGAIN FOR OUR FIRST PRESENTER IS AN WE BRING UP OUR OUR PANEL NOW STATES CAN USE CUTS WHICH UP THE. NEED. THANK YOU I THINK WE'RE GOING TO START WITH. LYNN CAROLEE. SEIGNEURIE ECONOMISTS FROM RAND. THAT WORK IN THIS FIELD FOR QUITE AWHILE AND IT GREAT TO SEE YOU AGAIN I BET YOU WHEN YOU'RE DOING ANOTHER WASTE POWER POINTS IF YEARS AGO SO. YES IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE HERE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR INCLUDING ME IN THIS. HEARING TODAY I'M GONNA BE SPEAKING ABOUT. A STUDY THAT WAS DONE BY THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES ENGINEERING AND MEDICINE. AND THE REPORT WAS RECENTLY ISSUED. PAUL TRANSFORMING THE FINANCING OF EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION. I WAS A MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE. ALONG WITH A. FILIA WHERE. SYRIA CHAU IS ALSO A NUMBER ANOTHER MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE. PUT TOGETHER BY THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES AND ENGINEERING AND MEDICINE TO CONDUCT THE STUDY. THIS WAS A NATIONAL EFFORT TO LOOK AT THE FINANCING FOR EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION BUT I THINK MANY OF BOTH THE FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS HAVE RELEVANCE FOR YOUR WORK HERE IN CALIFORNIA. JUST WANT TO BRIEFLY MENTION THAT THIS STUDY WAS SPONSORED BY A NUMBER OF PUBLIC AND PRIVATE ENTITIES AND I THINK IT SPEAKS TO THE FACT THAT THIS IS. AN ISSUE THAT IS DEEPLY RELEVANT ACROSS THE COUNTRY. BOTH AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL BUT AS WELL FOR STATES AND LOCALITIES. THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES STUDIES ALWAYS BEGIN WITH A STATEMENT OF TASK AND I JUST WANT TO BRIEFLY SUMMARIZE THAT THIS EFFORT. BY OUR COMMITTEE WAS DESIGNED TO LOOK AT THE ISSUE OF FINANCING FOR EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION FOR CHILDREN FROM BIRTH TO KINDERGARTEN ENTRY. WHERE THAT EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION WOULD BE ACCESSIBLE AFFORDABLE TO FAMILIES AND OF HIGH QUALITY? AND DELIVERED BY A WELL QUALIFIED IN ADEQUATELY SUPPORTED AND COMPENSATED WORKFORCE CONSISTENT WITH THE VISION AND AN EARLIER NATIONAL ACADEMY STUDY WHICH MANY OF YOU MAY BE FAMILIAR WITH CALL TRANSFORMING THE WORKFORCE. FOR CHILDREN FROM BIRTH TO EIGHT. SO ALL THAT STUDY SPECIFICALLY LOOKED AT THE WORK FORCE FROM BIRTH TO EIGHT. THIS STUDY IS GOING TO BE SPECIFIC TWO CHILDREN PRIOR TO KINDERGARTEN ENTRY. THE VISION ON THE PART OF THOSE THE COMMITTEE THAT PRODUCE THE TRANSFORMING THE WORKFORCE REPORT. WAS TO ACHIEVE HIGH QUALITY PRACTICE IN THE EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION SETTING. ACQUIRED HIGH QUALITY PROFESSIONAL LEARNING NEEDS AND OPPORTUNITIES TO SUPPORT THE KNOWLEDGE AND COMPETENCIES OF PRACTITIONERS AS WELL AS THE LEADERS AND. THE SETTINGS WHERE THEY DELIVER EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION. PRACTICE ENVIRONMENTS AND WORKING CONDITIONS THAT PROVIDE THE RESOURCES AND TOOLS NEEDED TO PORT THE WELL BEING OF PRACTITIONERS IN THE C. FEEL. AS WELL AS SUPPORT OF POLICIES FOR PROFESSIONAL LEARNING AND THE PRACTICE ENVIRONMENT. SO WITH THOSE UNDERLYING VISION FOR WHAT TO HIGH QUALITY WELL COMPENSATED WORKFORCE WOULD LOOK LIKE. OUR TASK WAS ESSENTIALLY TO LOOK AT WHAT THE COST WOULD BE. TO PROVIDE A SYSTEM THAT DELIVERED EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION BIRTH TO KINDERGARTEN ENTRY AS WELL AS TO THINK ABOUT ISSUES FOR HOW ONE WOULD FIND THAT SYSTEM. AND THE MECHANISMS BY WHICH ANY RESOURCES REYES TO SUPPORT SUCH A SYSTEM WOULD BE DELIVERED. SO WHAT TO SAY A FEW WORDS ABOUT TERMINOLOGY TO CONSENT THE STATE FOR EFFORT. FIRST OF ALL BY EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION I'M REFERRING TO PAID NON PARENTAL CARE AND EDUCATION PROVIDED OUTSIDE THE HOME FOR CHILDREN. INCLUDING CHILD CARE AND EARLY LEARNING SETTINGS. ACROSS THAT ZERO TO KINDERGARTEN INTERFERE EIGHT FIVE SPECTRUM. SO THIS IS INTENDED TO COVER THE PAID CARE THAT'S RECEIVED IN BOTH CENTER BASED SETTINGS AS WELL AS HOME BASED SETTINGS. AND SPECIFICALLY WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE WORK FORCE IN THOSE SETTINGS WERE REFERRING TO THE PRACTITIONERS THEMSELVES WORKING AND HOME ON SATURDAY SETTING SUCH AS EDUCATORS. LEAD TEACHERS FOR EXAMPLE THEIR ASSISTANCE OF AIDS AS WELL AS ADMINISTRATORS IN THOSE SETTINGS SUCH AS DIRECTORS AND THOSE WHO SUPPORT THE WORKFORCE AND THE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT. COACHES AND MENTORS. AND THE UNITED STATES THERE ARE CURRENTLY ABOUT A HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND CENTERS THAT PROVIDE CARE FOR CHILDREN FROM BIRTH TO KINDERGARTEN ENTRY. WITHIN THOSE CENTERS ARE ABOUT A MILLION PAY YOU SEE WORKFORCE MEMBERS AND ADDITIONAL MILLION MEMBERS OF EASY WORKFORCE PROVIDE CARE. ON AN EARLY LEARNING AND HOME BASED SETTINGS SO ARE STUDIES INTENDED TO APPLY TO THOSE APPROXIMATELY TWO MILLION PRACTITIONERS IN THE FIELD. PROVIDING PAID CARE THROUGH HOME AND CENTER BASED SETTINGS. ANOTHER TERM THAT I WANTED TO FINE IS. WHAT WE REFER TO AS FINANCING MECHANISMS THESE ARE THE METHODS BY WHICH FUNDS ARE DISTRIBUTED TO ENTITIES STAKEHOLDERS IF YOU WELL IN THE SYSTEM WHETHER THEY BE PROVIDERS? OR FAMILIES THE WORK FORCE OR THE SYSTEM AS A WHOLE SO FOR EXAMPLE WHEN WE TALK ABOUT FUNDING MECHANISMS THAT ARE PROVIDER ORIENTED. IT MEANS MECHANISM SUCH AS CONTRACTS ARE GRANTS WHERE THE FUNDING COMES DIRECTLY TO PROVIDERS HEAD START BEING EXAMPLE IN CALIFORNIA WOULD BE TOTAL FIVE PROGRAMS. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT MECHANISMS THAT ARE ORIENTED TOWARDS FAMILY THOSE ARE CASES WHERE YOU WOULD HAVE VOUCHERS OR TAX BASE PREFERENCES SO THAT FAMILIES ARE THE RECIPIENTS. IF YOU WILL OF THAT THE. SUBSIDY TO PAY FOR EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION. THEY'RE ALSO EXAMPLES OF MECHANISMS THAT ARE DIRECTED TO THE WORK FORCE. SUCH AS. VARIOUS KINDS OF GRANTS ARE STIPENDS THAT MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT THEIR PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AS WELL AS TARGETED. PAY INSIDE OF SUCH AS WAGE GIVEN LEVEL OF EDUCATION. AND SYSTEM WIDE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MECHANISMS THAT ARE DIRECTED SUPPORT LARGER SYSTEM EFFORTS LIKE QUALITY RATING IMPROVEMENTS SYSTEMS DATA SYSTEMS AND SO ON THAT AFFECT THE ENTIRE. I'M ECT SYSTEM FOR CHILDREN IN THESE AGES. ONLY THINK ABOUT THE LANDSCAPING. LANDSCAPE PRINT CONCERT CURRENTLY IN TERMS OF EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION AND FINANCING. AS I KNOW YOU ARE WELL VERSED IN THESE ISSUES NOW WE HAVE A SYSTEM THAT HAS OF MULTIPLE SOURCES. OF FUNDS RAISED AT THE FEDERAL STATE AND LOCAL LEVELS THROUGH SEPARATE PROGRAMS WHERE THOSE PROGRAMS OFTEN HAVE DIFFERENT STANDARDS WITH RESPECT TO. QUALITY ELIGIBILITY. WHICH TYPES OF PROVIDERS CAN RECEIVE THOSE FUNDS OF ITS PROVIDE ORIENTED. AND A VARIETY OF WAYS IN WHICH THE SYSTEM TODAY IS EXTREMELY COMPLEX. IN ADDITION. FUNDING COMES NOT ONLY FROM THE PUBLIC SECTOR BUT FAMILIES CONTRIBUTE AS WELL AND BY OUR ESTIMATE NATIONALLY FAMILIES ARE CONTRIBUTING ABOUT FIFTY TWO PERCENT. OF THE COST OF PROVIDING EASY FOR CHILDREN FROM BIRTH OUGHT TO KINDERGARTEN ENTRY. I THINK ANOTHER THING TO POINT OUT TERMS OF FAMILIES CONTRIBUTIONS THE DATA WE EXAMINE AND REPORT ON IN OUR REPORT. SO THAT THE LOWEST INCOME FAMILIES. WHO CONTRIBUTE TOWARD ECT WHEN THEY DO SO? IT'S TYPICALLY A HIGHER SHARE OF THEIR INCOME COMPARED TO HIGHER INCOME FAMILIES AND OTHER WORDS THE BURDEN IS GREATEST ON THOSE FAMILIES WHO CAN LEAST AFFORD. TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE COST OF HIGH QUALITY EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION. IN DOING OUR WORK OF THE COMMITTEE WE ESTABLISHED A SET OF PRINCIPLES FOR HIGH QUALITY EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION. THAT ARE PROVIDE A FOUNDATION FOR US BOTH TO EXAMINE THE CURRENT SYSTEM IDENTIFY WHERE THERE WERE GAPS OR SHORTFALLS BUT ALSO TO GUIDE A SET OF RECOMMENDATIONS THAT ALL TALK ABOUT. THAT I'LL TALK ABOUT LATER WE ALSO VIEW THESE PRINCIPLES AT ONCE AS ONE TO THE RELEVANT FOR OTHER ENTITIES AN UNDERTAKING THE KIND OF WORK THAT WE DID ON OUR COMMITTEE. TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE COST OF THE SYSTEM AND HOW ONE WOULD PAY FOR IT. SO I I THINK THESE MAY BE RELEVANT FOR YOUR WORK AND THINKING ABOUT ON THE OBJECTIVES THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE. I'LL SAY A FEW WORDS ABOUT. THE SIX PRINCIPLES. THE FIRST PRINCIPLE SAYS THAT HIGH QUALITY EASY REQUIRES A DIVERSE CONFIDENT EFFECTIVE WELL COMPENSATED AND PROFESSIONALLY SUPPORTED WORKFORCE ACROSS THE VARIOUS ROLES OF THE E. C. E. PROFESSIONALS. THE SYSTEM FAILS TO MEET THIS PRINCIPLE IN SEVERAL WAYS. FIRST OF ALL. AS I'M SURE YOUR WORK AS SHOWN IN THE WORK THAT WE DID ON OUR COMMITTEE SHOWS COMPENSATION FOR EASY PRACTITIONERS IS LOW. AND THAT'S TRUE WHETHER WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TEACHERS WITH BACHELOR'S DEGREES. AS WELL AS THOSE WHO PUT PLAY SUPPORTIVE ROLES ON THOSE IN LEADERSHIP ROLES. AND THAT'S A DRAWBACK IN TERMS OF OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN THAT WORKFORCE THAT WE NEED IN ORDER TO DELIVER THE HIGHEST QUALITY. OPPORTUNITIES FOR OUR CHILDREN. SECOND OF ALL THE CURRENT WORK FORCE ORIENTED FINANCING MECHANISM SUCH AS THE KINDS OF SUPPORTS THE CALIFORNIA HAS HAD. TO ENCOURAGE THOSE. MIGHT NOT HAVE A BACHELOR'S DEGREE FOR EXAMPLE TO GO BACK TO SCHOOL. THOSE FINANCING MECHANISMS DO NOT CREATE PREDICTABLE AND STUDY SOURCES TO EITHER BOOST THE SALARIES. OF THE LOAD COMPENSATED INDIVIDUALS IN THE FIELD AS WELL AS TO RECRUIT AND RETAIN THEM. SO THAT WE BILL THAT HIGH QUALITY WORKFORCE AND THEN FINALLY WHERE WE HAVE FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR ONGOING PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT. AND CALIFORNIA THAT INCLUDES THOSE THAT MIGHT BE AVAILABLE THROUGH THE UPON THE RATING IMPROVEMENTS SYSTEMS AT THE COUNTY LEVEL. FOR COACHING MENTORS AND SO ON THOSE SUPPORTS ARE ALSO ONES THAT. ARE NOT SUSTAINABLE PROVIDED ON A LIMITED BASIS SO AGAIN THEY DON'T NOT REACH THE. ENTIRE WORKFORCE IN A WAY THAT. ENCOURAGES A BELT THAT HIGH QUALITY WORKFORCE. THE SECOND PRINCIPLE STATES THAT HIGH QUALITY EASY REQUIRES ALL% CHILDREN AND FAMILIES TO HAVE EQUITABLE ACCESS. TO AFFORDABLE EASY ESERVICES ACROSS ALL ETHNIC RACIAL SOCIO ECONOMIC AND ABILITY STATUSES AS WELL AS ACROSS GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS. AGAIN OUR CURRENT FINANCING STRUCTURE FEELS TO ACHIEVE ON THE SUBJECT OF. I MENTIONED A MOMENT AGO THAT FAMILIES CURRENTLY PAY FOR ABOUT FIFTY TWO PERCENT OF THE TOTAL COST OF THE CD. AND FAMILIES WITH THE LOWEST INCOME SPEND ABOUT TWENTY PERCENT OF THEIR INCOME ON THAT CARE AND EARLY LEARNING WELL FAMILIES AT THE HIGHEST INCOME LEVELS PAY ONLY ABOUT SIX PERCENT OF THEIR INCOME. SO WE HAVE THIS INVERTED SYSTEM OF FAMILIES LEAST ABLE TO PAY PAYING A LARGER SHARE OF THEIR INCOME. EVEN FOR FAMILIES WHEN THEY QUALIFY FOR SUBSIDIZED UC'S SUCH AS THEIR HEAD START OR IN CALIFORNIA TITLE FIVE PROGRAMS OR SUBSIDIZE CHILDCARE. THOSE FAMILIES ARE NOT BUT NOT ALL FAMILIES WHO WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR THOSE PROGRAMS ARE ABLE TO RECEIVE. ASSISTANCE BECAUSE THE FUNDING SIMPLY IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO SERVE ALL FAMILIES WHO QUALIFY. AND THEN FINALLY THE LACK OF% HARMONIZATION ACROSS DIFFERENT FUNDING MECHANISMS WHETHER WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HEAD START. STATE CHILDCARE ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS AND OTHER STATE FUNDING SUCH AS TITLE FIVE IN CALIFORNIA. THOSE. MECHANISMS. LEAD TO GAP IN AFFORDABILITY FOR LOW INCOME FAMILIES AS WELL AS UNDER UTILIZATION BY MIDDLE INCOME FAMILIES MANY OF WHOM WOULD NOT QUALIFY BUT STILL FACE THE SAME ISSUES ABOUT AFFORDABILITY. AND THE ACCESS TO EASY. THE THIRD THROUGH SIXTH UP PRINCIPLES RATHER THAN GOING INTO DETAIL I JUST WANT TO EMPHASIZE. THAT EFFECTIVELY THEY SPEAK TO ENSURING ACCESS TO HIGH QUALITY CARE AND A RANGE OF SETTINGS. AND HERE IN PARTICULAR THE PRINCIPLES FOCUS ON THE NEED FOR ADEQUATE AND SUSTAINABLE FINANCING WITH INCENTIVES. EQUALITY AND LOVE THE WORDS LINKING FINANCING TO HIGH QUALITY. FINANCING FOR A VARIETY OF SERVICE DELIVERY OPTIONS THAT MEANS. A SYSTEM THAT WOULD ALLOW FOR MIXED DELIVERY SUCH A CENTER BASED AND HOME BASED SETTINGS. AN ADEQUATE FINANCING FOR FACILITIES AND FOR THE SYSTEM LEVEL SUPPORTS THAT ARE NEEDED. THOSE ARE OFTEN NEGLECTED ASPECTS WHEN WE THINK ABOUT FINANCING FOR ASSIST. AND THE CURRENT SYSTEM AGAIN FAILS TO MEET THESE REMAINING PRINCIPLES IN SEVERAL WAYS. FIRST OF ALL PROCEED A FINDING TYPICALLY IS NOT TIED TO QUALITY MANY OF OUR FUNDING STREAMS. ARE NOT EXPECTING FAMILIES TO BE ABLE TO USE THEM IN HIGH QUALITY SETTINGS OR LINK THE RECEIPT OF. PARTICULAR. REIMBURSEMENT FOR CARE TO THE QUALITY OF THE OF THE PROVIDER THE SETTING. SECOND WHILE THE LEVEL OF SUPPORT THAT IS PROVIDED TO PROVIDERS WHETHER WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HOME OR CENTER BASED SETTINGS IS TYPICALLY NOT SUFFICIENT TO COVER THE COSTS OF HIGH QUALITY. SO EVEN IF A PROVIDER HAS A FUNDING MECHANISM THAT'S ORIENTED TOWARD DEMOCRATIC CONTRACT FAMILIES HAVE VOUCHERS TO PAY FOR CARE OFTEN THE REIMBURSEMENT LEVELS TO SET THROUGH THOSE MECHANISMS THAT ARE NOT SUFFICIENT TO COVER. BECAUSE OF HIGH QUALITY. AND FINALLY. IN MANY RESPECTS WE DON'T HAVE FINANCING OR FUNDING STREAMS THAT SUPPORT THE SYSTEM LEVEL. RESOURCES THAT ARE NEEDED. TO PROVIDE THE OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY AND DATA AND OTHER WAYS IN WHICH WE SEE THAT WE HAVE A SYSTEM LEVEL ON HIGH QUALITY SYSTEM THAT PROVIDES ACCESS TO FAMILIES AND A WELL QUALIFIED WORKFORCE. SO ANOTHER OBJECTIVE. FOR OUR COMMITTEE WAS TO DEVELOP AN ESTIMATE OF THE COST OF DELIVERING HIGH QUALITY CD WITH A WELL COMPENSATED WORKFORCE. AT A NATIONAL LEVEL NOT GONNA SPEND A LOT OF TIME ON OUR PROCESS. OR OUR PARTICULAR NUMBERS BECAUSE. THEY WERE DEVELOPED TO BE A NATIONAL ESTIMATE RATHER ONES CIVIC TO CALIFORNIA. BUT I THINK THE EXERCISE THAT WE WENT THROUGH PROVIDED SOME IMPORTANT FINDING SO I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT. AND ALSO TO INDICATE THAT THE PROCESS THAT WE USE. STRATEGIES THE APPROACHES THE ASSUMPTIONS ARE ONE THE AT A STATE OR LOCAL LEVEL COULD BE REPLICATED TO SEE WHAT THE CONSEQUENCES WOULD BE. BEYOND THE NATIONAL LEVEL. I DO WANT TO SAY THAT ESTIMATING THE COST FOR HIGH QUALITY ECT AT A NATIONAL LEVEL WE HAD SEVERAL OBJECTIVES ONE WAS TO ACCOUNT. NOT ONLY FOR ON SITE BECAUSE OF THE COST OF A PROVIDER WHETHER TO CENTER HOME BASE SETTINGS. BUT ALSO TO ACCOUNT FOR THE SYSTEM WHITE BECAUSE I'M INTO YOU CAN SEE ON THIS CHART THE KINDS OF ON SITE COSTS THAT WE WANTED TO BE ABLE TO CAPTURE. SO STAFFING AS A MAJOR COST ELEMENT IN PROVIDING ECT BUT ALSO. TYING THAT TO ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT STAFF QUALITY AND THEIR COMPENSATION. OTHER ONGOING PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND SUPPORTS. THE FACILITIES THEMSELVES FOR EXAMPLE AND THAT AT THE SYSTEM LEVEL TO BE ABLE TO CAPTURE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT. QUALITY ASSURANCE AND IMPROVEMENT SYSTEMS DATA SYSTEMS AND SO ON. SO AGAIN THE GOAL IS TO BE. AS COMPREHENSIVE AS POSSIBLE AND WE ALSO WANTED TO TIE OUR ESTIMATES TO. THE FINDINGS OF THE TRANSFORMING THE WORK FORCE REPORT IN TERMS OF ESTABLISHING. TYPE OF HIGH QUALITY STAFF THAT WE WERE IN VISIONING AS WELL AS THE COMPENSATION TO GO WITH IT. SO JUST TO SAY A FEW WORDS. ABOUT THAT WE ASSUME THAT OUR SETTINGS THAT WE WOULD HAVE LEAD EDUCATORS WITH A BACHELOR'S DEGREE AS. CONSISTENT WITH THE TRANSFORMING REPORT THAT THOSE EDUCATORS WOULD HAVE ONGOING PROFESSIONAL SUPPORT FOR THEIR DEVELOPMENT THREE RESOURCES FOR COACHING MENTORING AND SO ON. THAT THE PROFESSIONAL STAFF WOULD HAVE PAID RELEASE TIME TO ALLOW THEM TO ENGAGE IN THIS PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT. THAT THERE WOULD BE RESOURCES TO SUPPORT CHILDREN WITH SPECIAL NEEDS AND HOME SATURDAY SETTINGS AND THAT. PROVIDERS WOULD HAVE NON CHILD CONTACT TIME THAT WOULD BE USE FOR EXAMPLE FOR PLANNING FOR SUSPECTS OF CHILDREN FOR MEETING WITH PARENTS WAYS IN WHICH THEY WERE SUPPORTED THAN THOSE ADDITIONAL ACTIVITIES. WE DID COME UP WITH THE NUMBER OF SO FOR THOSE OF YOU MAY HAVE SEEN THE REPORT OUR ESTIMATE NATIONALLY FOR THE U. S. ON AN ANNUAL BASIS WAS THAT THE COST OF A HIGH QUALITY EASY SYSTEM. WOULD BE ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FORTY BILLION DOLLARS. NOW FOR SOME THAT MAY SEEM LIKE A LARGE NUMBER OTHERS IT MAY BE HARD TO PLACE IN CONTEXT I THINK ONE WAY TO. CONTEXTUALIZE IT IS TO SAY THAT. OVER THE FOUR PHASES IN WHICH WE ENVISION THE SYSTEM BEING PHASED AND BY THE TIME YOU GET TO THE FINAL PHASE OR THE THE END GOAL. THE SYSTEM WOULD BE SPENDING ABOUT THE EQUIVALENT OF POINT SEVEN FIVE PERCENT OF US GDP ON EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION. THIS IS JUST ABOUT THE AVERAGE FOR OTHER HIGH INCOME COUNTRIES IN THE OECD. SO THIS IS CERTAINLY A REASONABLE ESTIMATE GIVEN WHAT WE SEE OTHER HIGH COUNTRIES DOING IN TERMS OF THEIR INVESTMENTS IN THIS AREA. IN ADDITION WE CAN ALSO PLACE IN THE CONTEXT OF K. TWELVE EDUCATION. SERVING CHILDREN FROM THE AGE VAN FROM ZERO TO KINDERGARTEN ENTRY REPRESENTS. IN THIS CASE ABOUT. ONE THIRD AS MANY CHILDREN AS ARE SERVED IN THE K. TWELVE SYSTEM. YET WE WITH. HAVE A SYSTEM THAT WOULD BE SPENDING ABOUT TWENTY TWO PERCENT AS MUCH AS THE K. TWELVE. SYSTEM AS A WHOLE SUSPENDED FEWER RESOURCES PER CHILD THAN WHAT WE SEE IN THE CASE. TO TWELVE YEARS. ANOTHER CONSIDERATION ONCE WE HAVE THAT ESTIMATE OF A HUNDRED FORTY BILLION DOLLARS WAS TO THEN INVESTIGATE HOW ONE COULD THINK ABOUT. OF THE SOURCES OF FUNDING TO PAY FOR THAT HIGH QUALITY EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION. AND OF COURSE ONE SOURCE IS THE PUBLIC SECTOR WHETHER THAT BE FEDERAL STATE OR LOCAL FUNDING BUT WE ALSO ONE TO CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY THE FAMILIES WOULD CONTRIBUTE MUCH AS THEY DO NOW. TO EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION ALMOND THE RIVER IDEA FOR APPROACHES FOR FIGURING OUT WHAT'S AN APPROPRIATE OR AFFORDABLE ABOUT FOR FAMILIES TO PAY. OF COURSE ONE APPROACHES THERE WOULD BE NO FEES FOR FAMILIES. THINK ABOUT IS OUR CURRENT K. TWELVE EDUCATION PUBLICLY FUNDED K. TWELVE EDUCATION. ONE COULD HAVE THE SAME KIND OF SYSTEM FOR CHILDREN FROM BIRTH TO FIVE. BUT ASSUMING THAT FAMILIES WERE TO CONTRIBUTE. THEIR NUMBER OF WAYS TO THINK ABOUT THE FEES AND WE DID THAT BY CONSIDERING FAMILIES PAYMENTS AT THE LOWEST INCOME LEVEL WOULD BE NOTHING. AS A WAY NOT TO HAVE ANY BARRIERS TO THEM BEING ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN HIGH QUALITY EASY. AND THAT FAMILY PAYMENTS AS A SHARE OF THEIR INCOME WOULD RISE AS INCOME INCREASED YOU COULD THINK OF THIS AS A PROGRESSIVE SYSTEM. FOR OIL ALLOWING FAMILIES TO CONTRIBUTE BUT DOING SO AS A SHARE OF THEIR INCOME WHERE THAT SHARE WOULD START OUT LOW. AND GRADUALLY RISE AS OPPOSED TO THE CURRENT SYSTEM I TALKED ABOUT WHERE WE SING THE HIGHEST FAMILY PAYMENTS AT THE LOW END AND DECLINING AS FAMILY INCOME RISES. SO. OUR REPORT THEN SHOWS. ESTIMATES OF WHAT THE SHARE WOULD LOOK LIKE FOR FAMILIES. WHAT IT WOULD LOOK LIKE FOR THE PUBLIC SECTOR WHAT I WANT TO CONCLUDE WITH OUR? SOME OF THE KEY RECOMMENDATIONS THAT I THINK ARE PARTICULARLY RELEVANT. FOR YOUR WORK BOTH AROUND FINANCING AND AROUND THE WORKFORCE. I AM THE REPORT DOES HAVE A TEN RECOMMENDATIONS IN TOTAL. I WANT TO SPEAK TO A FEW OF THEM THEY ARE GROUPS. BY RECOMMENDATIONS THAT ARE SPECIFIC TO AN EFFECTIVE FINANCING STRUCTURE. SHARING THE COSTS OF THE CONTRIBUTION WOULD BE EXPECTED POTENTIALLY FROM FAMILIES FOR PLANNING FOR A TRANSITION FROM THE CURRENT SYSTEM TO ONE THAT WOULD HAVE. A MORE EQUITABLE. SUSTAINABLE FINANCING SYSTEM WITH A HIGHLY QUALIFIED WORKFORCE. TRANSFORMING THE WORK FORCE ITSELF AND THEN RECOMMENDATIONS AROUND ASSESSING PROGRESS IN QUALITY. SO AGAIN I WANT TO JUST FOCUS ON A FEW OF THESE. GIVEN TIME BUT WOULD BE HAPPY TO TALK ABOUT OTHERS I'M IN THE FOLLOW UP. FIRST OF ALL WITH RESPECT TO HAVE AN EFFECTIVE FINANCING STRUCTURE THE FIRST RECOMMENDATION. UMBER FIRST OF THE FACT THAT WE EXPECT THERE WOULD BE A ROLE FOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S AND STATE GOVERNMENTS TO ESTABLISH CONSISTENT STANDARDS FOR QUALITY SO THAT WE HAVE A MORE UNIFIED SYSTEM AND THE WAY THAT WE APPROACH. SUPPORT FOR EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION THAT FINDING WOULD BE TIED TO QUALITY. REGARDLESS OF THE FUNDING MECHANISM THAT IS USED AND THAT STATE AND FEDERAL. FINANCING MECHANISMS. SHOULD ENSURE THAT PROVIDERS ARE RECEIVING PAYMENTS THAT ARE SUFFICIENT TO COVER THE TOTAL COSTS OF THESE ARE THREE ISSUES THAT I ADDRESSED EARLIER. IN OUR CURRENT SYSTEM THAT NEED TO BE. RECTIFIED. THE SECOND RECOMMENDATION SPEAKS TO. FINANCING WITH RESPECT TO AFFORDABILITY FOR FAMILIES. IN THIS CASE ONE OF OUR RECOMMENDATION HERE WAS THAT FAMILIES WOULD NOT BE EXPECTED TO RECEIVE ACCESS TO SUBSIDIES FOR EASY. BASED UPON THEIR EMPLOYMENT STATUS IN THE CURRENT SYSTEM RECEIPT OF SOME FUNDING IS TIED TO EMPLOYMENT SUCH AS CHILDCARE SUBSIDIES WHEREAS OTHERS ARE NOT HEAD START STATE FUNDED PRE K. PROGRAMS DO NOT TYPICALLY. A LOOK AT A FAMILY'S EMPLOYMENT STATUS IN DETERMINING ELIGIBILITY. SO WE THOUGHT IT WAS IMPORTANT THAT UP EMPLOYMENT STATUS NOT BE A CRITERIA FOR ELIGIBILITY. OF RECEIVING A PUBLIC SUBSIDIES. WE ALSO HAD A THIRD RECOMMENDATION LOOKED TO STATES. IN PARTICULAR AS A MECHANISM FOR. ADDRESSING THESE ISSUES FROM A SYSTEM WHITES PERSPECTIVE AND THAT STATES WOULD BE MUCH ENGAGED IN A PROCESS MUCH LIKE YOU ARE HERE. OF DEVELOPING. THE MECHANISMS THE UNDERSTANDING OF THEIR CURRENT SYSTEM SPEAK TO BE ABLE TO MOVE TOWARD THE TYPE OF SYSTEM THAT WE. ENVISION. WITH RESPECT TO COSTS ADAM AND SHARING THE COSTS THE CONTRIBUTION ON THE PART OF FAMILIES. WE RECOMMENDED THAT FINDING WHETHER IT BE AT THE FEDERAL STATE OR LOCAL LEVEL WOULD BE TO INCREASE IN ORDER TO SUPPORT THE HIGH QUALITY SYSTEM THAT WE ENVISION. AND THAT IF WE EXPECT FAMILIES TO CONTRIBUTE THAT IT WOULD BE DONE IN SUCH A WAY THAT FAMILIES AT THE LOWEST INCOME LEVEL. WOULD PAY NOTHING TOWARD THE COST OF CARE AND THE SHARE THAT THEY WOULD CONTRIBUTE WITH RISE WITH INCOME MUCH IS THE SYSTEM THAT WE MODEL THOSE AT. ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLE. WE DO I ENVISION A PLANNING PROCESS IN OUR ESTIMATES OF WE DO NOT ASSUME YOU COULD ACHIEVE THE TYPE OF SYSTEM WE ENVISIONED OVERNIGHT. ALMOND SO THERE'S A RECOMMENDATION SPECIFICALLY FOR PROPHECIES. TO WORK TOWARD THAT TRANSFORMATION. WITH RESPECT TO THE WORK FORCE. WE RECOGNIZED THAT. THERE'S A NEED BOTH TO THINK ABOUT THE INCUMBENT WORKFORCE AS WELL AS FUTURE WORKFORCE MEMBERS. AND SO WE WANT TO. ACKNOWLEDGE THE NEED FOR THE WORK FORCE TO RECEIVE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. WITH RESPECT TO. INCREASING KNOWLEDGE AND COMPETENCIES IN THE FIELD. WHETHER THAT'S THROUGH PROSECUTIONS THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION CREDENTIALING PROGRAMS AND OTHER SUBFORUMS OF PROFESSIONAL LEARNING. AND IN PARTICULAR THAT THE INCUMBENT WORKS FOR SHOULD NOT BE BURDENED WITH THE COSTS OF ACHIEVING THAT IMPROVEMENT IN THEIR SKILLS QUALIFICATIONS AND CALLED. WE ALSO RECOMMENDED THAT EXISTING EDGE PART OF THAT WORKFORCE TRANSFORMATION THAT RESOURCES AND SUPPORT. WOULD BE AB TARGETED SPECIFICALLY FOR THE INCUMBENT WORKFORCE TO DEVELOP THEIR QUALIFICATIONS. AND. THAT OTHER SUPPORTS WOULD BE AVAILABLE FINANCIAL AND OTHERWISE FOR THE WORKFORCE. THAT IS. MOVING INTO THE FIELD IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE NOT UNDULY BURDENED WITH THE COST OF ACQUIRING THE EDUCATION AND SKILLS THEY NEED. AS THEY MOVE INTO THE FIELD PARTICULARLY WHEN THE ISSUES OF COMPENSATION ARE ADDRESSED THE SHOULD BECOME LESS OF A NEED BECAUSE THE COMPENSATION WILL BE SUFFICIENT. AND RECOGNITION OF THE DEGREES AND COMPETENCIES OF THE PROFESSIONALS IN THE FIELD. WE ALSO HAD RECOMMENDATIONS SPECIFIC TO THE INSTITUTION'S POST SECONDARY INSTITUTIONS TO PROVIDE EDUCATION AND TRAINING. AND THE NEED TO BOOST THEIR QUALITY AS WELL AS THE FINANCING OF THOSE SYSTEM. SO THINK OF THESE AS THE ISSUES AROUND CURRICULUM AND THE PARTICULAR SETTINGS WHERE. EASY PRACTITIONERS AND. THE POST SECONDARY EDUCATION SYSTEM ACQUIRED THEIR SKILLS AND LEARNING. AND LIKEWISE THAT STATE. COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES. NEED INSIDE OF US. IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT THEIR PROGRAMS ARE OF HIGH QUALITY. I HAVE FINALLY WE HAVE RECOMMENDATIONS ABOUT THE LARGER SYSTEM TO ENSURE THAT THERE ARE THE SUPPORT FOR RESEARCH AND EVALUATION TO ASSESS WHETHER OR NOT A TRANSFORM SYSTEM IS ACHIEVING ITS GOALS. AS WELL AS OTHER DATA COLLECTION REQUIREMENTS THAT WOULD BE NEEDED TO MONITOR AND ENSURE THE ACCOUNTABILITY OF THE SYSTEM THAT WE ENVISION. SO IN SOME I THINK HE MESSAGES THAT COME OUT OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMIES REPORT. INCLUDE ARE WELL FOUNDED UNDERSTANDING NOW THAT HIGH QUALITY YOU SEE IS CRITICAL FOR CHILDREN'S POSITIVE DEVELOPMENT. AND HAS THE POTENTIAL TO GENERATE I'M SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIC RETURNS THAT OUR CURRENT FINANCING STRUCTURE IS INADEQUATE TO SUPPORT. THE RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION OF A HIGH QUALITY RESEARCH I WORKFORCE AND TO INCENTIVIZE MOVEMENTS TOWARD HIGHER QUALITY. THAT OUR CURRENT SYSTEM IS AN ADEQUATE WITH RESPECT TO ENSURING THAT ALL CHILDREN HAVE ACCESS TO HIGH QUALITY EASY REGARDLESS OF THEIR FAMILY BACKGROUND. AND TO FINALLY THAT THE TOTAL COSTS OF PROVIDING. ACCESS TO THE TYPE OF AFFORDABLE HIGH QUALITY SYSTEM THAT WE ENVISION IS ONE THAT WILL INDEED NEED NEW RESOURCES FROM THE PUBLIC SECTOR. EVEN IF WE EXPECT FAMILIES TO CONTINUE TO PAY A SHARE OF THOSE COSTS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME AND LOOK FORWARD TO ANY DISCUSSION THAT FOLLOWS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE WILL STOP HERE AND AND ENTERTAIN COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS ON THIS PRESENTER. WE CAN SEAT. YES COMMISSIONER OWNIK. SEEMS LIKE TO ASK YOU QUESTIONS IN WASHINGTON AND THEN ASK YOU QUESTIONS IN SACRAMENTO. SO. IT IN YOUR COMMENTS IN UNION PRESENTATION. I DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING ABOUT FAMILY FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS. AND IN TALKING TO SELL YOUR SHE SAYS THERE WAS INFORMATION ABOUT THAT AND I WONDER IF YOU COULD COMMENT ON. THE WHOLE NOTION OF IMPROVING QUALITY AND INTIMATE FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS WHICH IS A REALLY VERY INTIMATE KIND OF THING THAT GOES ON. BECAUSE THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION. SO THEY CAN THE ISSUE IS FAMILY FRIENDLY CARE AND I ASSUME BY THAT. I IT'S IMPORTANT TO DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN THOSE. CARE PROVIDERS THAT ARE UNPAID. AND THOSE THAT ARE PAID SO OUR STUDY DID IT INCLUDE HOME BASED CARE. THAT'S PROVIDED COULD BE FAMILY FRIEND OR NEIGHBOR BUT IS IF IT'S COMPENSATED CARE PAID CARE. THAT IS COVERED BY OUR WAYS ONE ALL OVER ESTIMATES OF. THE. NUMBER FAMILIES THAT USE CARE THE AMOUNT OF CARE THAT THEY USE FOR INFANTS TODDLERS AND PRESCHOOLERS ALL WERE BASED ON ESTIMATES THAT INCLUDED HOME BASE SETTINGS FAMILY FRIEND AND NEIGHBOR CARE. IT COULD ALSO BE THOSE WHO ARE FORMALLY LICENSE TO PROVIDE CARE AND HOME BASED SETTING SUCH AS. UP FAMILY CHILDCARE HOMES SO THAT RANGE OF PAID CARE PROVIDERS IN THE HOME BASE STUDIES IS CAPTURED. WHAT IS NOT CAPTURED OUR IS THE PART OF THE WORK FORCE THAT IS UNCOMPENSATED? AND SOME OF THAT MAY BE PROVIDED IN HOME BASE SETTINGS A CHILD'S HOME OR ANOTHER. INDIVIDUALS HOME AND THAT WAS JUST PARTLY A LIMITATION IN A CONSTRAINT ON OUR WORK IN THAT WE WERE CHARGED WITH LOOKING AT THE PAID SYSTEM. NOW IT'S ENTIRELY. POSSIBLE WITH THE TRANCE FORMATION THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. THAT WE WOULD DRAW ADDITIONAL INDIVIDUALS INTO THE EASY WORKFORCE SOME OF WHOM MAY BE CURRENTLY PROVIDING UNCOMPENSATED CARE. AND THAT THOSE SAME OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE DESCRIBE FOR. BECOMING A WELL QUALIFIED MEMBER OF THE PAID WORKFORCE WOULD BE OPEN TO THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO CURRENTLY TODAY. MAYBE PROVIDING CARE IN THOSE SETTINGS ON UNCOMPENSATED BASIS. WE HAVE SOME UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT MIGHT CHANGE IN TERMS OF FAMILIES USE OF CARE SO IF WE ELIMINATE THE BARRIERS OF THE TERMS OF THE COST OF CARE TO FAMILIES WE MAY EXPECT TO SEE MORE FAMILIES. MOVE INTO THE MORE FORMAL PART OF RTC SYSTEM WHICH POTENTIALLY HAS THE ADVANTAGE OF. MOVING CHILDREN INTO THESE MONITORED REGULATED. QUALITY SYSTEMS MANY FAMILIES THOUGH MAY STILL CHOOSE TO USE CARE THAT. UNCOMPENSATED FAMILY FRIEND AND NEIGHBOR CARE ALMOND THAT'S GONNA BE A FUNCTION OF THEIR UNDERLYING NEEDS FOR CARE THEY MAY BE USING A COMBINATION. OF CARE FROM THE MORE FORMAL SYSTEM IN THE INFORMAL SYSTEM DEPENDING UPON THEIR NEEDS. SO I I HOPE THAT ANSWERS THE QUESTION ABOUT WHERE IT'S CAPTURED AND WHY WE WOULD EXPECT THE SYSTEM IN A COMPLETE SYSTEM TO CONTINUE TO INCLUDE. SOME OF THE INFORMAL CARE THAT WE SEE IS THAT. YES COMMISSIONER EMISSIONS AND AGAIN IT. TO THIS. YES. COME. WHAT A FOLLOWUP BECAUSE I DIDN'T REALLY HEAR THE PIECE ABOUT? EXEMPT CARE PROVIDERS INCLUDED IN THE HOME BASED A SETTING SUN GLAD TO HEAR THAT IT SOUNDS LIKE. THEY ARE YES IT JUST AGAIN TO REFLECT THERE'S A MILLION INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE PROVIDE CARE AND HOME BASED SETTINGS. THAT WERE INCLUDING IN OUR VIEW OF THE SYSTEM SO ONE THING I AM I WANTED TO. YOU KNOW ALSO LIFT UP BECAUSE YOU ALSO SAID YOU WANNA DE DE LINK EMPLOYMENT WITH NEED AND ACTUALLY I REALLY. AGREE WITH THAT. BUT THE JOBS THAT A LOT OF FAMILIES PARTICULARLY LOW INCOME FAMILIES HAVE ACCESS TO OUR THESE JOBS THAT ARE IN. RESTAURANTS RETAIL HOSPITALITY MEDICAL FIELDS HOME HEALTH AIDES. AND. YOU KNOW A LOT OF THESE HIGH QUALITY EARLY LEARNING PROGRAMS ARE NOT OFFERED. SORT OF. DURING THOSE NONTRADITIONAL HOURS ON NIGHTS AND WEEKENDS WITH SCHEDULES THAT ARE VARYING. SO HOW WHEREIN THE VISION OF THIS E. C. E. SYSTEM DO YOU SEE A PLACE FOR A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF FAMILIES. WHO DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THOSE PROGRAMS PARTICULARLY IN THEIR COMMUNITIES THAT REFLECT? THERE. I THINK IT A COUPLE ANSWERS THE QUESTIONS AROUND THE. NEED FOR NON STANDARD CARE FIVE HOURS. FIRST OF ALL. THE SYSTEM THAT WE'RE DESCRIBING DOES STILL INCLUDE HOME BASED CARE SO FAMILIES WITH THOSE NEEDS FOR NONSTANDARD HOURS MAY CONTINUE OR MAYBE YOU DON'T CHOOSE TO USE HOME BASED CARE PROVIDERS. AND AGAIN THIS IS A SYSTEM THAT WE'RE ENVISIONING. WHERE IF YOU'RE IN THE PAID HIGH QUALITY WORKFORCE THAT IN YOU CHOOSE AS A PROVIDER TO OFFER CARE DURING THOSE NONSTANDARD HOURS THAT WOULD BE? YOU KNOW PART OF WHAT THE SYSTEM IS THAT WERE ENVISIONING. I THINK ANOTHER ASPECT OF. THE SYSTEM THAT WE ARE. SCRIBING IS WHY AND WHERE BECAUSE PROVIDERS WOULD BE COMPENSATED FOR THEIR COST OF CARE. THAT. WE WOULD EXPECT PROVIDERS TO OFFER MORE OPTIONS FOR CARE DURING NON AMHERST NONSTANDARD HOURS RECOGNIZING THE COST OF THAT PROVISION AND ONE BARRIER NOW. IS THAT IT'S HARDER FOR PROVIDERS TO DIFFERENTIATE AND RECEIVE REIMBURSEMENT TO REFLECT THOSE DIFFERENTIAL COST. SO WE CERTAINLY RECOGNIZE THAT THAT WILL BE AND NEED ON THE PART OF FAMILIES WILL CONTINUE I'M A SIMILAR KINDS OF ISSUES AND MORE WORLD SIGHTINGS VERSUS URBAN SETTINGS IN TERMS OF CARE ACCESS AND AVAILABILITY. THAT MEANS WE STILL WANT A SYSTEM THAT ALLOWS FOR A DIVERSE ARRAY OF SETTINGS AND PROVIDER TYPES. WE JUST WANT TO SEE THAT IT'S HIGH QUALITY. AND DELIVERED BY HIGH QUALITY WORKFORCE AND ONE WHERE THAT. WORKFORCE IS WELL COMPENSATED PROVIDERS ARE COMPENSATED FOR THEIR CAUSE. THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER RACE. Q. AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION. IN MUCH THE LITERATURE AND THAT THE CHIU. FRAT ON YOU YOU TALK ABOUT. THIS LEVERAGING AND IT WAS ONE OF YOUR CONCLUSIONS RECOMMENDATIONS SEVEN. SPECIFICALLY. ON LEVERAGING EXISTING FUNDING SOURCES AT THE STATE LEVEL. TO ENHANCE QUALITY FOR THE EASY WORKFORCE. IT IS OR SOMETHING THAT. THAT THAT IS CALIFORNIA FUNDING SPECIFIC THAT YOU CAN ENLIGHTEN US ON. WE CAN USE FOR THE LEVERAGING GRANT PROGRAMS ARE THE LIFE RIGHT SO WHAT I THINK THAT THE BASIC GOAL THAT WE WERE. THINKING ABOUT IN THAT RECOMMENDATION WAS THAT WE WANTED AS AS WE FIRST TRIED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT RESOURCES WERE CURRENTLY IN THE SYSTEM AND THE FUNDING AVAILABLE. THE CURRENT SYSTEM DOES HAVE MULTIPLE FUNDING STREAMS FEDERAL STATE EVEN AT AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. AND WHAT WE WOULD LIKE TO DO IS TO SEE A SYSTEM THAT IS MORE. HARMONIZED MORE UNIFIED BOTH IN THE SIDE OF ESTABLISHING FOR EXAMPLE STANDARDS FOR WHAT CONSTITUTES QUALITY. BUT ALSO IN THE WAY IN WHICH RESOURCES COULD BE BETTER PULL TOGETHER. AND HE USED FOR SUPPORTING THIS LARGER SYSTEM BOTH FOR THE DIRECT CARE PROVISION AS WELL AS LARGER SYSTEM COSTS. AND FOR SUPPORTING THE WORKFORCE. I DON'T KNOW THAT I CAN IDENTIFY SPECIFIC MECHANISM IN CALIFORNIA THAT WE MIGHT HAVE HAD IN MIND BUT THERE ARE SOME STATES THAT ARE. PUTTING FORWARD RESOURCES TO USE FOR PURPOSES OF INVESTING IN THEIR WORKFORCE. THAT MAY BE PART OF THEIR STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM FOR EXAMPLE WHERE THEY HAVE RESOURCES SPECIFIC SPECIFIC TO. WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT. WORKFORCE TRANSFORMATION AND SO WE WANTED TO SEE THAT THOSE WOULD BE RESOURCES THAT WOULD BE CAPTURED AS WELL THE VALUABLE TO THIS. TO THIS LARGER CYSTS. WHEN EXAMINING THE THE STATE'S ROLE. AS A COORDINATOR. SORTS FOR THE VARIOUS ENTITIES. WORKING WITH THAT WITHIN THE DC FIELD. WHAT ADMINISTRATIVE STRUCTURES WOULD WOULD NEED TO BE CHANGED ARE PUT INTO PLACE? TO MAKE THIS MORE EFFECTIVE. WELL I WOULD SAY THAT OUR COMMITTEE DID NOT GET DOWN TO THAT LEVEL OF SPECIFICITY IN TERMS OF WHAT THAT MIGHT LOOK LIKE A PART RECOGNIZING THAT STATES OFTEN APPROACH THESE. ISSUES AROUND. SORT OF INFRASTRUCTURE. THE. WAYS IN WHICH. THAT IS IS ESTABLISHED SO EXAMPLES WOULD BE AROUND GOVERNANCE ISSUES. IN THE STATE'S NOW. THEY TO EXTENT THAT STATES HAVE BEEN INVESTING IN STATE PRE K. PROGRAMS THE GOVERNANCE STRUCTURES THAT THEY PUT IN PLACE A VARIED QUITE CONSIDERABLY WHETHER. THEY HOUSE THAT IN THEIR DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION IN THE SOCIAL SERVICES DEPARTMENT ESTABLISH A NEW DEPARTMENT. HAVE SOME WAY IN WHICH YOU KNOW THAT EFFORT IS HOUSED WITHIN AN OVERALL GOVERNMENT STRUCK. SO WE RATHER VIEW THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THE STATES WOULD DETERMINE WHAT ARE THE NEEDED MECHANISMS IN PLACE TO ENABLE THAT KIND OF COORDINATION. AND HARMONIZATION OF A SYSTEM AND SOME STATES MAY BE FAR ENOUGH ALONG THAT THEY THINK THEY ALREADY HAVE. THAT INFRASTRUCTURE GOVERNMENT STRUCTURE IN PLACE OTHERS MAY NEED TO HAVE MORE TIME TO THINK ABOUT WHAT THAT WOULD LOOK LIKE. AND AGAIN IT'S GOING TO DEPEND APART THE HISTORY OF WHERE THEY BEN. ALONG WITH WHERE THEY'RE GOING TO. THANK YOU. THANK YOU COMMISSIONER MAC MILLAN. THANK YOU REPRESENTATION SO. IT ONE OF YOUR KEY ASSUMPTIONS YOU HAD. MENTIONED LEAD EDUCATORS WITH BA DEGREES CAN YOU TELL ME HOW THAT RELATES TO FAMILY CHILDCARE. SO AGAIN GOING BACK TO THE TRANSFORMING REPORT. THAT WAS OUR OUR FOUNDATION. IN TERMS OF THEIR RECOMMENDATIONS. THEY SPECIFICALLY RECOMMENDED THAT GOING FORWARD IN WHETHER YOU'RE AT HOME OR CENTER BASED CITING THAT THERE WOULD BE A BE A LEVEL. EDUCATOR AS PART OF THE PROVISION OF EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION. INFILL CHILD CARE SETTINGS. THAT MAY TAKE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT FORMS AND AND AGAIN I THINK PART WE NEED TO LOOK TO RESEARCH TO UNDERSTAND WHAT HIGH QUALITY LOOKS LIKE IN THE SETTINGS. SO IT MAY BE THAT IN A FAMILY CHILDCARE HOME WHERE YOU HAVE A SMALL GROUP THAT PROVIDER MAY HAVE. A BACHELORS LEVEL DEGREE AND WHAT WE'RE ALSO TALKING ABOUT IS COMPENSATION THAT GOES ALONG WITH THAT. ANOTHER MODEL BABY ONE WHERE YOU HAVE GROUPS OF FAMILY CHILDCARE HOMES WORKING TOGETHER. AND SUPPORTING THE STRUCTURES SUCH AS A BE A LEVEL. INDIVIDUAL WHO WOULD BE SUPERVISING OR SUPPORTING THE FAMILY CHILDCARE PROVIDERS IN THEIR OWN HOMES IF THEY DO NOT THEMSELVES HOW THAT LEVEL TO CREATE. I'M SO THERE'S DIFFERENT WAYS IN WHICH YOU COULD STRUCTURE THIS. AND. THAT BABY YOU KNOW STATE LEVEL DETERMINATION OR A FUNDING STREAM LEVEL DETERMINATION AS TO WHAT THAT SPECIFICALLY LOOKS LIKE. WE HAD TO MAKE A NUMBER OF ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT RATIOS. AT THINGS LIKE THAT IN COMING UP WITH OUR ESTIMATES AND IN DOING SO PARTICULAR WITH FAMILY CHILDCARE HOMES WE WEREN'T NECESSARILY ASSUMING. THAT HE WOULD HAVE THAT BE A LEVEL STAFF PERSON IN EVERY FAMILY CHILDCARE HOME BECAUSE OF THE ISSUES WITH RATIOS BUT IT COULD BE A SHARED. MODEL LIKE THE ONE I WAS DESCRIBING MAY I ASK. WHO HOME IN? WHAT RESEARCH WHAT GROUPS WERE INVOLVED IN THIS DECISION MAKING FOR FAMILY CHILDCARE? SO THAT I REFER YOU TO THE EARLIER NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES STUDY CALLED TRANSFORMING THE WORKFORCE. THAT WAS SPECIFICALLY LOOKING AT THE WORKFORCE SKILLS COMPETENCIES AND RECOMMENDATIONS ABOUT WHAT A HIGH QUALITY WORKFORCE WOULD LOOK LIKE. OTHER EXTENSIVELY REVIEWED THE LITERATURE AROUND. EDUCATION LEVELS OTHER SKILLS. AND TRAINING FOR THE WORK FORCE AND THAT WAS THEIR CONCLUDING RECOMMENDATION. WHICH ARE COMMITTEE WAS THEN GIVEN AS A. A FOUNDATION THAT WASN'T UP TO US TO. RE DEBATE THAT CONSIDERATION. OR OPEN BACK UP THE ISSUES THAT WENT INTO THAT RECOMMENDATION I I WOULD URGE YOU TO LOOK AT HOW LOOK AT THAT REPORT MORE SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE THEY ARE QUITE CONSIDERED. IN TERMS OF THE EVIDENCE THAT'S AVAILABLE NOW. THE NEED FOR FURTHER UNDERSTANDING AROUND THE ROLE OF DEGREES VERSUS OTHER WAYS IN WHICH WE. SUPPORT THE WORK FORCE IN TERMS OF THEIR SKILLS AND COMPETENCIES THROUGH PROFESSIONAL OTHER PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT MECHANISMS. AND THERE MAY BE INDEED BE A PERIOD OF TRANCE TRANSITIONING THE WORK FORCE FROM OUR CURRENT WORKFORCE TODAY MANY OF WHOM DO NOT HAVE THOSE DEGREES PROTECTING FAMILY CHILDCARE SETTINGS. TO ONES WHERE THEY'RE PROVIDED WITH. PORTS DURING A TRANSITION. TO A WORKFORCE WITH THE EXPECTATIONS THAT THOSE COMING INTO THE WORKFORCE WOULD HAVE THOSE HIGHER SKILLS AND COMPETENCIES AGAIN WITH OUR RECOMMENDATIONS AROUND THE SUPPORT FOR ATTAINING THOSE DEGREES. AND THE COMPENSATION THAT GOES WITH IT. AND SO THAT I THINK IS A WAY OF VIEWING THAT. COMBINATION OF DEGREES SUPPORT FOR DEGREES THE WORK THAT YOU DO IN THE FIELD AND THE COMPENSATION THAT'S RECEIVED TO ALIGN THEM IN SUCH A WAY. THAT WE CAN HAVE A HIGH QUALITY WORKFORCE IN BOTH HOME AND CENTER BASED SETTINGS. HOME. I GUESS YOU CAN TELL BY MY FACE I'M NOT REALLY PLEASED WITH. THE FINDINGS IN THIS AT BEING A FAMILY CHILDCARE PROVIDER WHO DOES NOT HAVE A BACHELORS WHO HAS AN ASSOCIATE'S DEGREE SO THIS WOULD THIS WOULD BE A MAJOR UPHEAVAL IN THIS FIELD THAT I LOVE SO MUCH. AND SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND OTHER FAMILY CHILDCARE PROVIDERS IN THE STATE LOVE SO MUCH AND SO THAT'S WHY I ASK YOU WHO. DID TO TALK TEN YOU REFERRED ME BACK TO THAT THIS ASSOCIATION AND THE STUDY AND I AM GOING TO LOOK INTO THAT. BECAUSE. I DON'T THINK THAT THERE FIND IS CLEARLY REPRESENT. FAMILY CHILDCARE AND MY SISTER AND BROTHER NOW PROVIDERS WHO DO THIS WORK EVERY DAY AND ARE PASSIONATE ABOUT THIS WORK SO ON BUT THANK YOU FOR BEING THE MESSENGER. THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND I THINK I GET TERRIBLE INSTRUCTIONS BY COMMISSIONERS WHAT I MEANT YEAH QUESTIONS I'M A HORRIBLE TEACHER RIGHT NOW LIKE GIVING INSTRUCTIONS TO GIVE A QUESTION LIKE THAT SO I KNOW WHO'S. WHO TO ASK? ASSEMBLY MEMBER RUBIO. THANK YOU YES. MY COMMENTS ARE. IN LINE WITH WHAT YOUR SAME BECAUSE I HAVE A MANY CHILD CARE PROVIDERS THAT. THAT DO PROVIDE EXCELLENT. WITH KAREN EXCELLENT. FOR AN EXCELLENT FOUNDATION FOR THE KIDS NOW ARE AS A FORMER TEACHER I CAN TELL YOU. EVEN IN THE THE SCHOOL SETTING PRESCHOOL TEACHERS ARE UNDER THE CLASSIFIED. DESIGNATION NOT NECESSARILY CERTIFICATED AND THEN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A CERTIFICATE A POSITION VERSUS. CLASSIFIED IS ABOUT. INC HE WE. IT'S THE BE. COMMON CORE MATH. IT'S ABOUT THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS DIFFERENCE AND IF YOU HAVE A BACHELORS DEGREE AND I'M ME BEEN OUT OF SCHOOL SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND THREE NINE STORE. PAYING MY MY STUDENT LOANS AYE I'M TRYING TO PROVIDE FOR MY FAMILY AND ON TOP OF THAT PAY FOR STUDENT LOAN IF WORK. I HAVE ADDITIONAL BURDENS. BECAUSE IT REALLY AT. THE DEGREE DOESN'T NECESSARILY PROVIDE A MAKE SOMEBODY PROVIDE THAT BETTER. EDUCATION OR BAR. SERVICES. THERE IS A BIG DISCONNECT AND I FEEL LIKE IN THE GAME YOU ARE ONLY THE MESSENGER BUT THE COMMENT WOULD BE HIS. BOB POLICING ADDITIONAL BURDENS WOULD LESSEN THE POOL OF QUALIFIED. QUALIFIED AND PASSIONATE. PROVIDERS AND SO HOW DO WE RECONCILE THAT THE INFORMATION IS GREAT AND WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT THAT'S GREAT. AND THAT IS. ALSO IN AN IDEAL WORLD AND WE'RE HERE BECAUSE IT'S NOT AN IDEAL WORLD SO IF WE CAN FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAY BE RECONCILED THAT INFORMATION TO THE REALITIES OF WHAT'S REALLY HAVE. NOW WOULD BE GREAT APPRECIATE THE INFORMATION APPRECIATE THE MESSENGER BUT I I DO AGREE WITH. THE COMMENTS ABOUT. YOU KNOW HOW WE CAN THE PLACE THESE ADDITIONAL BURDENS. AND ARE WE GONNA HAVE ENOUGH PROVIDERS. THAT MAKE THAT. HOW DOES QUALITY? SO I THINK THIS IS IN RESPONSE THE THING I WOULD ADD IS THAT. CAN LOOKING AT OUR RECOMMENDATION SPECIFICALLY TO THE WORKFORCE. THAT OUR RECOMMENDATIONS ARE REVOLVE AROUND NOT INCREASING THE BURDEN ON THE WORKFORCE IN TERMS OF DEGREE OPPOSITION. SO WHY RECOMMENDATION WAS SPECIFIC THAT THOSE WHO ARE CURRENTLY COME BUT MEMBERS OF THE WORKFORCE WOULD PAY NO COST. TOWARD ACHIEVING ANY DEGREE REQUIREMENTS THAT MAYBE AND A NEW SYSTEM. AND SECOND OF ALL THAT FOR THOSE COMING INTO THE WORKFORCE THAT THERE WOULD BE AN ALIGNMENT BETWEEN WHAT THEY WOULD BE EXPECTED TO CONTRIBUTE AND THEY'RE EXPECTED SALARIES. SO PARTICULARLY AND THAT THE CURRENT SYSTEM WITH COMPENSATION THAT'S LOW IN AN ADEQUATE. THAT WOULD IMPLY GREATER DEGREE OF SUBSIDY JUST TO ACHIEVE THE DEGREE OF PAYMENTS. ONCE YOU SEE THAT TRANSFORMATION THAT WE'RE DESCRIBING HERE OF A WORKFORCE THAT'S COMPENSATED. ASSISTANT WITH THERE DEGREES CONSISTENT WITH OTHER PRACTITIONERS. EATING FOR EXAMPLE KINDERGARTNERS IN A PUBLIC SCHOOL. THAT IF YOU HAVE EQUIVALENT AGREES TRAINING COMPETENCIES THAT YOU WOULD BE COMPENSATE ACCORDINGLY. THAT THAT WOULD THAT MIGHT IMPLY MORE OF THE UP FRONT COSTS REQUIRED FUSION MIGHT BE BORNE BY THE INDIVIDUAL BUT WITH THE EXPECTATION. THAT THEY WOULD BE COMPENSATED ACCORDINGLY JUST LIKE OTHER MEMBERS INDIVIDUALS ATTAIN HIGHER EDUCATION WITH THE EXPECTATIONS OF THE FIELDS THEY MOVE INTO. WILL ALLOW THEM TO PAY BACK THEIR STUDENT LOANS AND SO ON. SO I THINK. THAT IT'S AGAIN IT'S THE COMBINATION OF WHAT WE'RE RECOMMENDING LOOKING SPECIFICALLY AT EXPECTATIONS FOR THE WORKFORCE AND THEIR SKILLS AND COMPETENCIES ADAM. DEGREES CREDENTIALS THE COMPENSATION THAT GOES WITH IT AND THAT WHATEVER SETTING THEIR END. THAT THEIR REIMBURSEMENT THROUGH ANY PUBLIC SUBSIDIES WOULD RECOGNIZE THAT COMPENSATION THE OTHER COSTS ACCORDINGLY SO THAT HE WON'T HAVE THE SHORTFALLS THAT WE HAVE TODAY. THAT DON'T ALLOW FOR HIGH QUALITY PROVISION BECAUSE. THE. THE REIMBURSEMENT STRUCTURES ARE NOT CONSISTENT WITH PROVIDING PIPE. THANK YOU COMMISSIONER COMPASS REBEL. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR FOR THE PRESENTATION AND I AM. AND AND I I FEEL LIKE MY QUESTION HAS ALREADY BEEN ANSWERED STILL BE MORE OF A COMMENT I GUESS I AM VERY HOPEFUL AND I THINK THAT THE DATA THAT'S BEFORE US AND RESEARCH AT THE FORCES. THAT ARE REALLY HELPING FORMER THINKING OBVIOUSLY THERE'S GOING TO BE SOME AREAS WHERE WE'RE GONNA SCRATCH OUR HEADS A LITTLE BIT MORE AND ONE BURKE HOW CAN WE. ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES IN CALIFORNIA. I THINK AS WE TALK ABOUT BA'S AND AND OUT WHEN THE CHOOSE SHOULD HAVE. AND AGAIN WEBER COMIN REINFORCE WHAT'S JUST BEEN SAID I THINK IT WAS A LUMINA FOUNDATION THAT PUT TOGETHER REALLY GOOD STUDY ON WHAT PRIOR LEARNING LOOKS LIKE AND I THINK THAT'S REALLY WITH THIS BODY AND MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE GOING TO REALLY HAVE TO GRAPPLE WITH. I'M AND REALLY THINK ABOUT THOSE COMPETENCIES AND IN ADDITION TO JUST THE BE A AYE WE KNOW THAT THERE'S. YOU DON'T TEACHERS ARE EARLY ED TEACHERS PROVIDERS ITEM CARETAKERS THAT HAVE BEEN DOING THIS WORK FOR THIRTY YEARS AND ARE FABULOUS THEY DON'T HAVE TO BE A. AYE BUT IF IF WE GOT TO OUR NORTH STAR BECAUSE WE SHOULD THINK NORTH STAR I AGREE. I'M SUCH AS WE TALK ABOUT WORKFORCE OP AS WE HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS REALLY THINKING ABOUT. PRIOR LEARNING AND THAT AND REALLY TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THAT LEVEL OF EXPERIENCE ON THOSE YEARS OF WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE I YOU HAVE IN THE YOU'RE ABLE TO CONTRIBUTE. ARMS I THINK THIS AND THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THIS BODIES IS REALLY GOING TO HAVE TO GRAPPLE WITH HOW DO WE INCORPORATE PRIOR LEARNING. I MEAN REALLY INVITE. MEMBERS OF THE COMMISSION AND AND THE AUDIENCE REALLY LOOK AT THIS REPORT AND AGAIN I THINK IT WAS THE LUMINA FOUNDATION THAT DID IT THAT LOOKED AT OTHER SECTORS OUTSIDE OF EDUCATION AND WHAT OTHER SECTORS BUSINESS SECTORS. ARE DOING I'M IN ADDITION TO JUST THE BE EIGHT BUT THAT ARE GONNA PUT HIM UP HIGH. ON THE. SALARY PIECES WELL SO THANK YOU. COMMISSIONER WITH THE. AND THANK YOU ALSO FOR THIS REPORT I THINK IT'S VERY HELPFUL I THINK ALL OF US UP HERE OF TAKING THAT ONE HUNDRED FORTY BILLION DOLLAR NUMBER IN TRYING TO DO THE MATH AND FIGURE OUT WHAT THAT WOULD BE IN CALIFORNIA. WHAT PUT FOUR BILLION ALRIGHT THERE WE GO ONE PREFER REALLY TEN BILLION? A FABULOUS I'M I'M I'M CURIOUS BECAUSE YOU TALKED IN THE VERY BEGINNING ABOUT THREE BUCKETS ALMOST RIGHT THE COST OF THE EARLY KERN EDUCATION COSTS OF THE WORK FORCE PEACE NET COST OF THE STATE MECHANISM. OF IS A HUNDRED AND FORTY BILLION DECIDE WORKOUT IMPROPER IN IN WHAT PERCENTAGE FALLS UNDER EACH CATEGORY I'M CURIOUS I'M PROBABLY IT YOU MAYBE YOU DIDN'T DO IT OUT THAT WAY OR IF YOU DID PERCENTAGE VERSUS PHASE AND I'M JUST CURIOUS. HOW THAT WORKED OUT ON A NATIONAL LEVEL? I CAN TELL YOU JUST OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD THAT THE SYSTEM LEVEL COSTS WERE ABOUT EIGHT PERCENT OF THAT NUMBER THE HUNDRED FORTY BILLION DOLLAR NUMBER. SO MOST OF IT IS IN THE DIRECT CARE PROVISION. HOW MUCH OF IT IS TIED TO FOR THE WORK FORCE TRANSFORMATION I'D HAVE TO GO BACK AND LOOK BUT? AGAIN IT'S GOING TO BE A RELATIVELY SMALL SHARE MUCH OF THAT IS THE DIRECT CARE PROVISION OKAY IF WE CAN GET THAT NUMBER THAT PERCENT YEAH THAT WOULD BE REALLY REALLY HELPED ALL THAT. THANK YOU. AND I WILL NOT THOSE OF A MATH THERE SO CALIFORNIA'S ABOUT TEN PERCENT GO SAY IT'S ABOUT THERE WOULD BE FOURTEEN FOURTEEN FOR GAMBLING. YEAH BUT WE HAVE NO I DIDN'T A CRAFTY BUT THAT'S IT. YEAH HOUSING CITED A WE CAN DO ONE POINT FOUR BILLION SUPPORT FOR THE. COMMISSIONER AYALA. THANK YOU LIANE BECAUSE IT'S A IT'S A VERY COMPLEX ISSUE IT'S A BIG BIG PICTURE. BUT I JUST WANT TO HAVE US THIS COMMISSIONERS THINK OF ASPIRATION. THAT THIS IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN OVERNIGHT. IF THOSE OF YOU WHO'VE BEEN AROUND FOR A LONG TIME I SEE SOME FRIENDS. I REMEMBER WHEN KIM THERE WAS NOT A MANDATE IT IT STILL IS NOT. BUT WE'RE TEACHERS DID NOT HAVE A CREDENTIAL. IN ITS TAKEN AS ALL THESE YEARS TO GET HERE. SO JUST A COUPLE BERMAN SAYS BECAUSE WE HAVE THESE VERY HEATED. AND I'M TALKING HEATED DISCUSSION. THAT WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT DISPLACING THE EXISTING WORKFORCE. WE ACTUALLY NEED MORE. THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT NO COST SHOULD BE INCURRED BY THE EXISTING WORKFORCE. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT OVER TIME PHASING IN OVER A MAY BE AT TEN OR TWELVE YEAR. PROCESS. WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT. MAKING SURE THAT. PEOPLE'S. EXPERTISE AND EXPERIENCE ARE DISCOUNTED BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO NEED THAT. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR CHILDREN ARE CARED FOR AN EDUCATED. AND WE KNOW THAT THOSE PEOPLE THAT HAVE HAD A LOT OF EXPERIENCE. IF THEY CAN DEMONSTRATE THROUGH COMPETENCIES ARE PATHWAYS THAT'S A DECISION THAT CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO ME. THIS IS A NATIONAL REPORT. THAT WAS BASED ON ANOTHER REPORT THEY DID TALK SPECIFICALLY THAT A LOT OF RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THAT GROW. WHICH IS THE NATIONAL RESOURCE AND REFERRAL ASSOCIATION. AND A LOT OF OTHER GROUPS IN TERMS OF RESEARCH THAT HAD BEEN DONE WITH HOME CARE. IT WAS ALSO THE PREVIOUS REPORT WAS NOT ONLY EDUCATION BUT IT DEALT WITH SOCIAL WORK AND HEALTH PROVIDERS. AS IT RELATED TO THE ZERO TWO EIGHT POPULATION. SO I WANT US TO THINK. NOT WHAT IS. BUT WHAT SHOULD BE. AND THAT WE THINK ABOUT NOT THE BARRIERS TODAY. BUT HOW WE GET THOSE. PATHWAYS CAREER PATHWAYS ARE HARMONIZATION OF FUNDING. IN THE WAY THAT GETS IS THERE AND I WANNA GO BACK JUST TO TO MISS THEM. LAGOS A OR ACTUALLY IT WAS. ELEVATIONS THEM RAISES QUESTION THERE ARE SOME. MODELS THAT ARE WORKING FOR US. BUT THEY'RE SMALL. AND. RIGHT NOW WE MIGHT BE INVESTING. I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY BILLION BUT AS YOU SAID MR MCCARTY WE NEED FOURTEEN MORE BILLION. AND I THINK MICHAEL HAD TO ATTEND BUT I LIKE YOUR NUMBER BETTER. FOURTEEN BILLION TO GET US TO WHERE WE NEED TO BE. BUT IT'S GONNA BE OVER TIME AND SO I I DON'T WANT US TO BECOME DISCOURAGED. I WANT US TO BECOMING COURAGE AND EXCITED ABOUT THE POSSIBILITIES BECAUSE FOR ME AFTER ALL THESE YEARS. I SEE THE LIGHT. I REALLY DO LOVE AT THAT TIME THING WILL MAKE YOUR LIFE A JUST A REMINDER THAT'S WHAT THIS BLUE RIBBON COMMISSIONS ABOUT IS TO LOOK AT THE NORTH STAR AND. AND AND. BE PROVOCATIVE IT THINK YOU KNOW WHERE WE ARE TODAY AND WHERE WE SHOULD BE BUT I BUT I WILL NOTE THAT THESE THESE ISSUES. AS FAR AS THE EDUCATION LEVEL TO BE A WE DO NOW WE'VE TALKED ABOUT HEAD START BECAUSE THEY ARE THEY'RE MAKING THIS CHANGE. IN ONE OF THE REASONS THAT THAT YOU BROUGHT UP WHAT WHY IT'S HARD. IS BECAUSE SO MANY PEOPLE IN THE FIELDS UP ONE THEY'RE DOING A GREAT JOB YOU KNOW AND IT. A PUSH THEM OUT AS HAVING SOME RECOGNITION AS YOU TRANSITION WHETHER IT'S A GRANDFATHER CLAUSE WHAT HAVE YOU BUT. SAY IT'S HARD BECAUSE THERE ARE. PEOPLE IN THE FIELD ARE GETTING PAID YOU KNOW IN AND OUT BURGER COSCO WAGES WILL FINALLY PAY THOSE POVERTY WE JUST PRAY THAT THEIR WORKFORCE AND SO. I THINK THAT'S A PIECE TO AS WE LOOK AT YOU KNOW PROPERLY. SETTING OUR RATE STRUCTURE FOR THE PROGRAMS. THEN WE CAN ACKNOWLEDGE THAT ISSUE AND THEN I THINK YOU CAN TACTIC TO TAKE A LOOK AT YOU KNOW EDUCATION LEVELS AND WHAT IT COSTS. BECAUSE YOU KNOW THE RESEARCH DOES SHOW THAT HAS AN IMPACT ON QUALITY IF YOU WANT. GIVES THE SHOW UP IN YOUR FORMER KINDERGARTEN CLASSROOM HERE RAY LEARN DAY ONE. AND THIS IS A REALITY OF SO. WITH THAT AT GREAT BUT PRESENTATION GOOD DISCUSSION WE WILL NOW MOVE ON TO. PROFESSOR. MANY INDIAN. CLOSE. MELENDEZ MEANT OKAY IN INDIA YES ASSISTANT DIRECTOR AND. PROFESSOR. RESEARCH AT THE HOSPICE A TOOT AT UC BERKELEY. THANK YOU. AND WELCOME TO THE STATE ASSEMBLY TODAY. THANK YOU COMMISSIONERS AND CHAIRMAN MCCARTY. NOT ONLY FOR HAVING US HERE BUT FOR YOUR ATTENTION ON THIS VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE. CRITICAL BRAIN DEVELOPMENT OCCURS BEFORE AGE FIVE AND YET. THE UNITED STATES RANKS TWENTY SIXTH OUT OF OECD COUNTRIES IN THE FRACTION OF FOUR YEAR OLDS THAT ARE ENROLLED IN PRE K.. AND TWENTY FOURTH IN THE FRACTION OF THREE YEAR OLDS. BUT. I'M NOT HERE TO PRESENT ON THE SUBSTANTIVE ISSUE HIGH. I'M HERE RATHER TO DISCUSS A POLICY FRAMEWORK FOR YOU TO CONSIDER. THAT. WE THINK MIGHT BE VERY HELPFUL AS YOU CONSIDER YOUR RECOMMENDATIONS. AND THAT FREE MARKETS WHAT SOME FED A SCOTCH PAUL AND HARVARD CALLS TARGETING WITHIN UNIVERSALISM IN WHAT WE CALL. IT THE HAWES INSTITUTE TARGETED UNIVERSALISM. SO THIS FRAMEWORK IS AN EQUITY FRAMEWORK. BUT IS NOT A POLICY AND DOES NOT SUBSTITUTE FOR POLICY. AND IN FACT IT'S NOT A STRATEGY RATHER IT'S AN APPROACH BY WHICH EQUITY STRATEGIES MAY BE DERIVED. AND IT ALSO EXPRESSES A COMMITMENT TO BOTH PROCESS IN EQUITY OUTCOMES. IT'S AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE BINARY TRAP OF EITHER TARGETED FOR UNIVERSAL POLICY SO I'M GONNA TRY AND. IF WE RUN THROUGH THOSE AND THEN OPEN UP FOR. SOME QUESTIONS. PART OF THE CHALLENGES THAT THAT THIS TRAP OF TARGETED VERSES UNIVERSAL. IS CREATES A FALSE BINARY THAT WE. THAT WE NEED TO ACTUALLY FIND OUR WAY THROUGH. SO UNIVERSAL POLICIES ARE THOSE THAT ASPIRE TO SERVE EVERYONE WITHOUT REGARD TO GROUP MEMBERSHIP STATUS ARE INCOME. AND THEY TEND TO SET A UNIFORM EITHER SET OF BENEFITS OR OUR GOAL OR SET A MINIMUM PROTECTIONS SO. FOR EXAMPLE SINGLE PAYER HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS. OR. IN A. THE. THE POPULAR THING THESE DAYS IS THE UNIVERSAL BASIC INCOME WHICH IS A IS A POLICY APPROACH THAT WOULD. PROVIDE A BENEFIT THAT OF EQUAL AMOUNT TO EVERYONE REGARDLESS OF INCOME SO THE WEALTHIEST INDIVIDUALS WOULD RECEIVE THE SAME BENEFIT. IS THE POOREST. AND SO THE IDEA OF UNIVERSAL IS THAT IT IT REALLY MEANS EVERYONE. SO SOMETIMES POLICIES ARE DEVISED THAT HAVE A UNIVERSAL SCOPE OR FRAMING BUT ARE ACTUALLY TRYING TO SOLVE THE TARGETED PROBLEM THE FMLA IS A. EXAMPLE OF THAT ITS ORIGINAL IMPETUS WAS TO. PROVIDE LEAVE FOR FAMILIES WITH. WITH PREGNANT. PARENTS PIG PARENTS AND NEW PARENTS AND. IN ITS ULTIMATE EXPRESSION THE THE LAW ACTUALLY ALLOWED ANYONE TO TAKE A LEAVE INCLUDING CARING FOR ELDERLY PARENTS OR SIBLINGS. SO IT'S AN EXAMPLE OF A UNIVERSAL APPROACH WITH A TARGETED A TARGETED PROBLEM. NOW ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WITH TART WITH UNIVERSAL APPROACHES IS THAT UNIVERSAL APPROACHES. ACTUALLY HAVE A TENDENCY IN MANY INSTANCES TO EXACERBATE INEQUALITY. SO IN THE INITIAL CDC STUDY OF THE MASSACHUSETTS UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE THE SO CALLED ROMNEYCARE APPROACH. THE CDC REALIZE THAT WHILE EXPANDING INSURANCE COVERAGE TO EVERYONE. THE DIFFERENTIAL ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE ITSELF ACTUALLY EXPANDED THE RACIAL GAPS IN ACCESS TO CARE. SO I CAN ASSURE YOU A COUPLE SLIDES AND HOW THAT CAN MODEL OUT. THE FIRST ONE WE DEFINE WHEN WE DEFINE TARGETED WOULD BE A POLICY THAT TARGET SPECIFIC POPULATIONS BASED UPON THEIR CHARACTERISTICS ARE DEMOGRAPHICS. AND SO. IN THIS CASE THERE'S A RECOGNITION THAT THERE IS A PROBLEM AND IN THE POLICY LUCIEN POLICY PROPOSE OUR SOLUTION IS TAILORED TO THAT PROBLEM. SO EXAMPLES MIGHT BE THE AMERICAN JUST WITH DISABILITIES ACT WHICH NOT ONLY PROHIBITS DISCRIMINATION REQUIRES EQUAL TREATMENT. BUT ALSO REQUIRE SPECIAL ACCOMMODATIONS INCLUDING EASEMENTS ENTRANCES AND PARKING. AND SO YOU CAN THINK ABOUT DIFFERENT POLICY SOLUTIONS THAT MIGHT FALL INTO THE UNIVERSAL VERSUS TARGETED A FRAMEWORK SO YOU COULD COMPARE. UNIVERSAL BASIC INCOME WITH A NEGATIVE INCOME TAX WHICH WOULD BE CONDITION ON INCOME OR. SNAPPED VERSUS A SINGLE PAYER APPROACH. SO ONE OF THE PROBLEMS IS A ALREADY MENTIONED WITH EQUAL TREATMENT A UNIVERSAL APPROACHES IS THAT IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY GET EVERYONE TO THE GOAL. SO THIS IS LIKE A MEME THAT CIRCULATE ON THE INTERNET QUITE A BEEN THERE NUMBER OF. IMAGES LIKE THIS THAT ILLUSTRATE THAT PROBLEM RIGHT THAT EQUAL TREATMENT DOES NOT ACTUALLY GET EVERYONE. TO THE EQUITY OUTCOME. SO HERE IS A HERE'S ANOTHER SLIDE THE CAN SHOW HOW UNIVERSAL PROGRAM CAN DO THIS. SO I'M. CONSIDER FOR EXAMPLE THAT YOU HAVE TO GROUPS AND THEY COULD BE RACIAL GROUPS GENDER GROUPS A. ANY GROUP ANY ANY GROUP BASED CHARACTERISTIC AND YOU HAVE A UNIVERSAL PROGRAM. AND UNIVERSAL PROGRAM IS A HE IS THE TREATS THAT EXTENDS BENEFITS EQUALLY INTRIGUES MEMBERS OF EACH GROUP OF THE SAME. BUT OF FOR MEMBERS IN THE SHADED GROUPS A DAY LIVE IN NEIGHBORHOODS THAT SAY FOR EXAMPLE ARE ISOLATED FROM JOBS AND SO JOB TRAINING PROGRAM WOULD ACTUALLY FREE. THE PEOPLE WHO NOW HAVE THE SKILLS TO SECURE THE JOBS WHEREAS THE PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE TRANSIT TO THE JOBS WHO DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THE JOBS. A WERE WHY THEY MAY HAVE THE. THE HUMAN CAPITAL THEY DON'T ACTUALLY ARE ABLE TO ACTUALLY SECURE THOSE JOBS AND THIS IS THE PROBLEM THE CDC IDENTIFIED IN MASSACHUSETTS WHICH WAS THAT. ACTUALLY HAVING INSURANCE DOESN'T GIVE YOU ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE PROVIDER. SO WHAT IS TARGETING UNIVERSALISM AND HOW CAN ACTUALLY SOLVE THIS PROBLEM. THIS IS A LOT OF TAX BILL FOR ME TO SAY THAT BASICALLY IT'S AN APPROACH. THAT SUPPORTS THE NEEDS OF THE PARTICULAR WHILE REMINDING US THAT WERE ALL PART OF THE SAME SOCIAL FABRIC SO REJECTS A KIND OF UNIVERSAL BLANKET THAT'S INDIFFERENT TO IT TO HELP PARTICULAR GROUPS ARE SITUATED IN SOCIETY. IS AND IT ALSO REJECTS A KIND OF FORMA A FORMAL EQUALITY THAT ACTUALLY. CREATES A DISPARATE IMPACT. SO IN ITS MOST SIMPLIFIED FORM WHAT IT MEANS TO SETTING UNIVERSAL GOALS AND PURSUING THOSE GOALS WITH TARGETED PROCESS HE'S GONNA WALK YOU THROUGH A STEP BY STEP. FRAMEWORK TO SHOW HOW YOU DO THIS. SO THE FIRST STEP IS YOU HAVE TO ESTABLISH THE UNIVERSAL GOAL BASED UPON. A BROADLY SHARED UNDERSTANDING OF THE PROBLEM. A SECOND THEN IS YOU ASSESSED THE GENERAL POPULATION PERFORMANCE TO THE UNIVERSAL GOAL SO CAN BE ANYTHING BE. A MATH PROFICIENCY COULD BE INCLUDES A YEAH COULD ENGLISH PROFICIENCY IT COULD BE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE COULD BE ACCESS TO EARLY QUITE A HIGH QUALITY EDUCATION AND. CHILDCARE I'M SO THE FIRST THING YO DO IS YOU NEED TO DO A KIND OF GENERAL PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT. THE THIRD IS THEN YOU BEGIN TO SEE THE LOOK AT SUB GROUPS AND YOU IDENTIFY GROUPS AND PLACES SO IT'S NOT JUST. UP COMMUNITIES OUR POPULATIONS BUT YOU ALSO NEED TO LOOK AT GEOGRAPHIES. SEE HOW THOSE PLACES AND GROUPS ARE PERFORMING RELATIVE TO BOTH THE OVERALL POPULATION BUT ACTUALLY MORE IMPORTANTLY THE GOAL RIGHT BECAUSE THE GOAL SHOULD NOT BE TO GET. YOU KNOW ONE GROUP TO WHERE THE BEST PERFORMING GROUP IS BUT RATHER EVERY GROUP TO THE GOAL ITSELF. RIGHT THAT'S ACTUALLY A KEY DISTINCTION. THIS IS ACTUALLY THE MOST IMPORTANT STEP IN A TARGET PERSONAL SOME FRAMEWORK. STOOD THEN ASSESS AND UNDERSTAND THE STRUCTURES THAT EITHER SUPPORT OR IMPEDE. EACH COOPER COMMITTEE FROM ACHIEVING THE GOAL SEAT ACTUALLY HAVE TO CONDUCT AN ANALYSIS TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IS IT THAT'S HOLDING FOLKS BACK. NOW IT MAY BE BARRIERS IT MAY BE CHALLENGES MAY BE A LACK OF TRANSPORTATION IT MAY BE A LACK OF SUPPORT. BUT IT MIGHT ALSO BE THAN SOME OF THE COMMUNITIES THEY ARE OTHER SORT OF PROACTIVE OF AFFIRMATIVE STRUCTURES THAT ALLOW FOLKS TO ADVANCE TO THE UNIVERSAL GOAL SO IT'S NOT ALWAYS A BARRIER SO MUCH AS IT MAY THE ABSENCE OF RESOURCES OR. OR CAPACITIES. AND ONCE YOU DEVELOP AN ASSESSMENT AND ANALYSIS THEN YOU NEED TO BEGIN TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT TARGETED STRATEGIES FOR EVERY GROUP. SO IT'S A UNIVERSAL BLANKET STRATEGY TO TREAT EVERYONE THE SAME I ACTUALLY FAILED TO GET YOU TO THE UNIVERSAL GOAL. AND SO THIS IS ACTUALLY THE CRITICAL PART AS YOU MIGHT HAVE A MARRIED A PLETHORA OF STRATEGIES. BUT THOSE STRATEGIES ARE NECESSARY TO GET EVERYONE TO THE GOAL AND THAT IS THE HEART OF THE TARGET PERSONAL SOME FRAMEWORK. FRAMEWORK IS A FOCUS ON UNIVERSAL GOALS BUT TO RECOGNITION THAT YOU NEED TARGETED POLICIES TO TO REACH THOSE GOALS. NOT JUST A COUPLE OF CAVIAR ARE NOTES ON THE FRAMEWORK. TARGETING WITHIN A TARGET VERSE WASN'T FRAMEWORK DOES NOT ALWAYS MEAN TARGETING PEOPLE OR EVEN POPULATIONS OFTEN DOES BUT NOT ALWAYS OF COURSE THERE ARE. LIMITATIONS WITHIN CALIFORNIA'S PROP TWO A NINE I COULD HAVE A WHOLE SEPARATE SEMINAR IN ON THAT. BUT. THE HEART OF TARGETED UNIVERSALISM IS ACTUALLY TARGETING INSTITUTIONS AND STRUCTURES. SO I CAN GIVE YOU A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES. ONE OF THE ONE OF THE PLACES THAT HAS OPERATIONALIZED ORGAN VERSOS AND IS THE CITY OF AUSTIN AND TEXAS. AND WHAT THEY DID WAS THEY DIDN'T ASSESSMENT AND THEIR GOAL WAS TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERY RESIDENT IN THE CITY. LIVE WITHIN OUR HAD ACCESS TO GREEN SPACE AND LIVE COULD COULD LIVE WITH AND A HALF OR A QUARTER MILE. OF OF THE PUBLIC PARK AND SO THEY THEY CREATED GIS MAP IN THE ASSESSED WHERE RESIDENTS LIVE RELATIVE TO THE GREEN SPACES AND THEY CREATED NEW GREEN SPACES RIGHT. THAT'S THE INSTITUTIONAL APPROACH AS OPPOSED TO MOVING PEOPLE YOU ACTUALLY CREATE GREEN SPACE WHERE PEOPLE ARE SO THE FOCUS ISN'T ON PEOPLE PER SE IT'S ACTUALLY ON THE INSTITUTION STRUCTURE CONSISTS. THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT. THE TARGET REVERSALS APPROACH ALWAYS TARGETS. INSTITUTIONS ARE STRUCTURES. THERE WAS A PROGRAM A VERY VALUABLE PROGRAM IMPLEMENTED IN BALTIMORE CALLED VISION FOR BALTIMORE. IS A PROGRAM LAUNCHED BY THE CITY HEALTH DEPARTMENT. BASED ON A RECOGNITION THAT FIFTEEN THOUSAND STUDENTS IN THE SCHOOL SYSTEM WHO NEEDED. A MEDICAL CARE SPECIFICALLY NEED THAT NEEDED CONTACT LENSES OR GLASSES WEREN'T GETTING AS YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW THAT. WAS A BARRIER TO ACTUALLY LEARNING. AND SO THEY PROVIDED HEALTHCARE PROGRAM THAT BOTH SCREEN AND THEN PROVIDED THAT. THE PROVIDED THAT RESOURCE. SO IN THAT CASE YOU'RE ACTUALLY CREATING INSTITUTIONAL PROGRAM THAT DOES TARGET PEOPLE BUT THE POINT IS THAT MORE OFTEN THAN NOT A TARGET REVERSALS OF APPROACH WILL FOCUS ON SYSTEMS AND STRUCTURES AND INSTITUTIONS. FINALLY IN IMPLEMENTING A TARGET REVERSALS APPROACH. IT'S IMPORTANT THAT YOU NOT JUST BRING TOGETHER THE EXPERTS. AND THE LEGISLATORS AND THE COMMISSIONERS BUT YOU ACTUALLY BRING TO GO THE PEOPLE FROM THE COMMUNITIES WHO ARE AFFECTED. AND THAT YOU MONITOR THE PROGRAMS TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S ACHIEVING THE OUTCOME AND YOU MAKE ADJUSTMENTS OVER TIME SO IMPLEMENTATION AND EVALUATION ARE OUR VITAL. AND THAT'S IT THERE'S A VIDEO WHICH I AM A LITTLE A THREE MINUTE VIDEO THAT JUST GOES OVER THIS I WON'T SHOW YOU SHOW RIGHT NOW BUT IF YOU'D LIKE TO LOOK AT IT. PLEASE PLEASE CHECK IT OUT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU COMMISSIONER NOBODY. FULLER. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR. THIS REPORT THIS SPEAKS TO OUR HEART BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT EQUITY PERSONS EQUALITY. IS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TONIGHT PARTICULARLY. I'M LOVING THE FACT THAT THAT ANY OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS THAT IT IS IMPORTANT TO TALK TO PEOPLE. WHO NEED THE SERVICES? IN ORDER TO FIND OUT WHAT THEY NEED BECAUSE OFTENTIMES IN OUR PROFESSIONS WEEK KIND OF. FIGURE OUT THIS IS WHAT PEOPLE NEED WITHOUT ACTUALLY. REACHING OUT TO THEM AND FINDING THAT OUT SO THANK YOU THIS IS THIS WAS GREAT. I WOULD LIKE TO GET THE POWER. THANK YOU COMMISSIONER IGNATIUS. I HAVE CLIENTS AMAZING. I ACTUALLY LEARNED ABOUT TARGETED UNIVERSALISM. BECAUSE WE BROUGHT A GROUP TOGETHER TO LOOK AT WHAT IT WOULD TAKE TO BRING A RACE CLASS AND GENDER ANALYSIS TO THE EASY. SYSTEM AND IT WAS OUR INCREDIBLE CONSULTED TAMMY JONES AND HOPEFULLY YOU HEAR ME. SHE RAISED TO US AND. IT SO OFTEN THE CONVERSATION OR NOT HAVING. AND. OFTENTIMES WE ARE CREATING PROGRAMS THAT THE VERY PEOPLE WHO WERE TRYING TO TARGET. UP CANNOT GET TO AND THEN WE PENALIZE THEM AND WE DEMONIZED THEM FOR SOMEHOW NOT. YOU KNOW JUMPING OVER OR THROUGH OR UNDER A HUNDRED THOUSAND HOOPS TO GET TO IT AND I REALLY. BELIEVE THAT THIS COMMISSION IS REALLY COMMITTED TO TAKING THIS APPROACH. I HAD TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T DO THAT. AND THAT A FUTURE SYSTEM REALLY CONSIDERS AND UNDERSTANDS WHAT. THE NEEDS ARE OF AB WHO WE ARE TRYING TO TARGET. MY QUESTION TO YOU. YOU KNOW WHERE SHOULD WE. START. WE TALKED ABOUT A NEEDS ASSESSMENT. WE'VE TALKED ABOUT DOING FOCUS GROUPS OF FAMILIES. IF YOU WERE YOU KNOW. ADVICE EVEN THIS COMMISSION WILL I GUESS YOU ARE HOME WHERE WHERE WOULD YOU TELL US TO START. YES. I THINK BOTH OF THOSE PLACES ARE VITAL STARTING POINTS AND YOU YOU CAN'T YOU CAN'T DO ONE WITHOUT THE OTHER. HE NEEDED YOU NEED TO LOOK AT THE DATA AND SEE WHERE THE POPULATIONS ARE THE SUBGROUP RELATIONS ARE WITHIN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. BUT YOU ALSO HAVE TO DO THE QUALITATIVE SIDE YOU HAVE TO MEET WITH GROUPS. AND FIND OUT IS YOUR SPECIAL YOU DEVISED THE STRATEGIES YOU KNOW WHAT OF THE ACTUAL BARRIERS AND STRUCTURES THAT ARE ALLOWING SOME GROUPS TO ADVANCE THE UNIVERSAL GOAL AND HOLDING OTHERS BACK. THANK YOU COMMISSIONER MCMILLAN. THE THANK YOU FOR THAT I HAD NEVER HEARD OF TARGET UNIVERSALISM SO YOU. JUST EDUCATED ME ON THAT AND NOT. KNOWING THAT BEEN A PART OF THE LABOR MOVEMENT. WE COULD NOT ARE ALREADY DOING THAT ESPECIALLY WOULD FAMILY CHILDCARE BECAUSE WE WORK OUT OF OUR HOMES AND SO FOR US TO. EVEN FIND OUT ABOUT OUR UNION AND AND AND WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IT HAS TO BE. IT HAS TO BE BROUGHT TO US. IS THAT HOW IT WORKS IN MY IN MY DOING A GOOD COMPARISON OR AM I NOT. WHAT I HAVE TO HEAR A LITTLE BIT MORE BUT I I THINK THAT? PART OF WHAT WE'RE SUGGESTING HERE IS THAT TO GET EVERYONE TO THE GO TO THE UNIVERSAL GOAL REQUIRES A MULTITUDE OF STRATEGIES. AND ONE SIZE ACTUALLY DOES NOT FIT ALL AND THAT ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH THAT'S JUST SINGULAR UNIVERSAL CAN ACTUALLY EXACERBATE INEQUALITY CAN MAKE THINGS WORSE. AND SO I I APPRECIATED WHAT. I GUESS I HAD TO SAY ABOUT ABOUT. HARMONIZING APPROACHES BUT ALSO BEING FLEXIBLE AS PART OF WHAT I HEARD I THINK THAT. THE TRICK THOUGH WITH TARGETING REVERSALS IN IS THAT. IT'S NOT ACTUALLY JUST TARGETED THAT YOU'RE ACTUALLY THINK ABOUT THE UNIVERSAL GOAL. AND WE THINK ABOUT INEQUALITY WE OFTEN FOCUS ON GETTING SAY WHAT LATIN NEXT TUNES FOR AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS TO WEAR WHITE STUDENTS ARE. BUT IN MANY PLACES WHAT WHAT WHITE STUDENTS HAVE SHOULD BE THE GOAL. RIGHT WE'RE TRYING TO GET EVERYONE TO UNIVERSAL GOAL. AND SO IT'S THERE REALLY IS THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN TARGETING. WHICH MIGHT IN ON SOME PLEASE LOOK LIKE AN AFFIRMATIVE ACTION STRATEGY AND ACTUALLY GETTING EVERYONE TO THE UNIVERSAL GOAL WHICH MEANS CREATING SUPPORTS. IN THE LATTER'S IN THE IN THE CAPACITIES TO DO THAT. SO IF I THINK I THINK YOU'RE THERE SO YOU REALLY ARE SHIFTING A PARADIGM SO TO SPEAK SO THAT'S RIGHT SIDE BRING IN THAT DARTBOARD TO THE DARK. IN SOME CASES IT CAN MODOC PLAYOFFS ON US. OKAY YEAH I THINK THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION. I WILL MOVE ON NOW WITH GRAHAM DOBSON. WITH THAT GOOD AFTERNOON ASSEMBLY MEMBERS AND COMMISSIONERS ON GRAHAM PHELPS AND I WORK AT THEY SAN FRANCISCO OFFICE OF EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION. WHERE RECENTLY? FORMED OFFICE WHERE WE WE BROUGHT OF THE CONSOLIDATED ALL OF THE FUNDING THAT WAS. FOR THE VIEWS YOU TO FIVE YEAR OLDS IN SAN FRANCISCO UNDER ONE ROOF SO WHEREAS PREVIOUSLY WE HAD THREE SEPARATE. CITY DEPARTMENTS SORT OF WORKING WITH THAT FUNDING IS DOES FUNDING SOURCES REPORTED UNDER ONE ROOF AS AN OFFICE OF THE SEA. AND. RECENTLY WE'VE IMPLEMENTED A NEW FUNDING MECHANISM FOR EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION SYSTEM IN THE CITY. WOULD TREAT CALLED ARE ILL THE LEADING SCHOLARSHIP SO I THINK IT'S JUST AN EXAMPLE OF OF SOME BUT YOU KNOW TO. TO GIVE A MODEL OF WHAT WE KNOW WHAT WITHIN TEMAS OF HOW TO EXPAND. ACCESS AND ALSO. ESPECIALLY TO HIGH QUALITY ENVIRONMENTS SO I JUST SOME CONTEXT I YOU KNOW I THINK AS A MODEL SAN FRANCISCO'S A LITTLE IS DIFFICULT BECAUSE WHERE PRETTY UNIQUE AT PLACES WHERE BOTH YOU KNOW WHERE CITY AND THE COUNTY AND WE ONLY HAVE ONE SCHOOL DISTRICT. AND WE DO HAVE. I SOME SIGNIFICANT AT A LOCAL INVESTMENTS IN ONLY TEN EDUCATION THROUGH SOME. SOME SET ASIDES AND. AND TAX. DEL SET ASIDES THAT COME TO E. C. E. SPECIFICALLY SO WE HAVE A LOT OF LOCAL INVESTMENTS THAT WE CAN USE WHICH I ISN'T ALWAYS THE CASE IN AND OTHER COUNTIES. I'M NOT GONNA GO THROUGH ALL OF THIS I THINK YOU ALL KNOW WHERE A HIGH COST COUNTY RENTS ARE RIDICULOUS. AND AND IT'S IT'S REALLY HARD TO DO BUSINESS THERE AND TO LIVE THERE. BUT WE DO HAVE A ABOUT FORTY FOUR THOUSAND CHILDREN. UNDER THE AGE OF FIVE AS PART OF A POPULATION. THEY TOOK IT A LITTLE BIT OF A BREAK DOWN OF THAT PICKED THE INCOME OF THE FAMILIES THAT ARE WITHIN THOSE FORTY FOUR THOUSAND CHILDREN. THE YELLOW IS THAT OUR CHILDREN. YOU KNOW WE BOTH INFANTS AND TODDLERS AND PRESCHOOL AGE WHO UNDER THE STATE A SUBSIDY ELIGIBILITY OF EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE SMI YES I MY DOESN'T REALLY WORK IN SAN FRANCISCO BECAUSE IT'S A STATE MEDIAN INCOME AND THAT'S DOESN'T REALLY. WORK WITH US SO WE KNOW WHAT WE'VE WE'VE BEEN WORKING OR IN OUR OFFICE LOT JUST LOOKING AT THE SUBSIDIES STATE SUBSIDIZED. ELIGIBLE FAMILIES BUT ALSO. WE WHAT WE CALL LOW TO MODERATE INCOME FAMILIES WHO ARE BETWEEN EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE SMI AND A HUNDRED AND TEN PERCENT OF THE AREA MEDIAN INCOME WHICH IS A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE AIR MY AS OPPOSED TO THE SMI. IT IS ASKING QUICK QUESTION THERE I'M SORRY MY. ASSEMBLY MEMBER MISS I KNOW HE WOULD BE THE PERHAPS HILL TOLD ME THAT HE SAYS ALLOW YOU TO GO BACK TO SAN FRANCISCO. BUT THEY SAY THE JOKE THAT THE LAST PERSON WITH A FAMILY CLOSE THE DOOR ON THE WAY OUT OF SAN FRANCISCO WE ARE SHOWING HERE IS THAT. YOU'RE SEEING THAT RIGHT HERE FOR ZERO TO TWO. IT'S DIFFERENT FROM THREE TO FIVE RIGHT. HERE ARE YOUR SAYING THAT THAT THAT THE FAMILY THE NEWER FAMILIES. OUR EAT THE INCOME IS. HIGHER CORRECT SO DIRECT. SO AND THEN THE GREEN HERE AS ABOVE FAMILIES WITH INCOME ABOVE A HUNDRED TEN PERCENT OF YET AM I. SO CURRENTLY THAT THE FACT THAT THE TARGET AUTAUGA POPULATION WITHIN OUR WITH OUR SYSTEM THAT WE FUNDING LOCALLY JUST BECAUSE EVEN WITH OUR. MONEY THAT COME THAT WE HAVE LOCALLY FATS FLEXIBLE WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH TO SERVE EVERY SINGLE UNIT YOU KNOW UNIVERSAL. IN FROM TOTAL OF ZERO TO FIVE PRESCHOOL ACCESS WE DON'T HAVE THAT SO AGAIN ARE TARGETED OUR TARGET IS UP TWO HUNDRED AND TEN PERCENT OF AT MY WITHIN OUR FUNDING SYSTEM. SO I GUESS OUR OUR OVER ACHIEVED GOALS REALLY OUGHT TO INCREASE FUNDING TO THE PROGRAMS TO PROVIDE TO TO REALLY COVER THE CUT THE ACTUAL COST OF PROVIDING HIGH QUALITY CARE WE KNOW THAT A LOT OF THE PROGRAMS THAT ARE RECEIVING SOME YOU KNOW. FUNDING FROM THE STATE AND FROM THE FADS THAT THE REIMBURSEMENT RATES A DALY REIMBURSEMENTS JUST DON'T GO ANYWHERE NEAR A MILLION THE COST OF ACTUALLY PROVIDING HIGH QUALITY OF CARE. AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WERE REALLY LOOKING FOR IS LOOKING FOR CONTINUITY OF CARE THAT ONCE A CHILD'S AND DOES THE SYSTEM AT ANY AGE FROM ZERO TO FIVE. THAT WE WILL GUARANTEE FUNDING FOR THAT FAMILY TO RECEIVE SERVICES FROM WHENEVER THE END OF THE SYSTEM UP TO WHEN THEY HAD TO KINDERGARTEN. YOU KNOW HAS BEEN SO MUCH CHAIRMAN IN AND OUT OF SIGHT OF ELIGIBILITY AND AND DIFFERENT SUBSIDY FUNDING SOURCES FOR FAMILIES AND REQUIREMENTS THAT WE'VE SEEN THAT FAMILIES LOSE A. LEASE SUBSIDIES A LOSE ACCESS AND THEN TO THE GAP AND THEN THE CHILD YOU KNOW LOSES THEIR THEIR SERVICES AND THEN WE HAVE TO START THE FAMILY STARTS OVER AGAIN AND SO WE'RE TRYING TO REALLY. MINIMIZE THAT COMPLETELY BY SEN ONCE YOU'RE NOT SYSTEM ONCE YOU'RE ELIGIBLE YOU GET EMAIL YOU GET YOU KNOW A FUNDING WE WILL GUARANTEE THAT WE WILL FOLLOW YOU ALL THE WAY UP TO CAN THE GARDEN. WE DO HAVE TARGET POPULATIONS PRIORITY POPULATIONS THAT WE ARE WORKING WITH THAT'S BE. LIKE REALLY US FOCUSING ON. IT LOW INCOME AFRICAN AMERICAN AND LATINO FAMILIES ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS HOMELESS FAMILIES OF. CHILDREN WHO ARE IN THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM AND CHILLING WITH SPECIAL NEEDS WE DO YOU KNOW AFRICAN AMERICAN LATINO FAMILIES. WE ARE SPECIFICALLY CALLING UP BECAUSE WE SEE A LOT OF DISC YOU KNOW ONE OF THOSE DISCREPANCIES IN THE KINDERGARTEN READINESS. I IN SAN FRANCISCO DESPITE ALL OF OUR. INVESTMENTS ON AND WORK TOWARDS A MINIMIZING THAT WE ARE SEEING THESE DIFFERENCES IN CAN BEGUN READING OF SCORES AND SO WE REALLY WANT IT WITH LATINO OR NOT. AFRICAN AMERICAN FAMILIES AS OPPOSED TO ASIAN AND WHITE FAMILY SO THATS WHY. YOU KNOW THERE IS A PRIORITY FOR. FOR SERVICES AND IN CERTAIN COMMUNITIES WITHIN CERTAIN DEMOGRAPHICS. WE ONE. TERM TO FULLY UTILIZE OF STATE AND FEDERAL FUNDING THAT'S COMING TO LOOK TO MY COUNTY. WE DON'T WANT TO LEAVE DOLLARS ON THE TABLE YOU WILL USE ALL OF THE STATE MONEY THAT YOU GET ALL OF THE FEDERAL MONEY. THAT WE GET BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT OUR LOCAL GOES AWAY MORE FLEXIBLE AND WE CAN DO A LOT MORE WITH NOTS REVIEWS WE WILL LEVERAGE THOUGH STATE AND FEDERAL DOLLARS. AND LIKE I SAID BEFORE WE REALLY WANT TO TRY TO ASSIST MORE MODERATE INCOME FAMILIES BECAUSE THAT THE STATE ELIGIBILITY OR FEDERAL LEVELS WILL HE DOESN'T NECESSARILY WORK FOR. FOR THE REALITY OF SOME OF OUR FAMILIES IN SAN FRANCISCO. SO I WILL GO THROUGH ALL OF THIS I JUST WHEN YOU KNOW THAT WE HAVE A CITY WIDE PLANNED FOR EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION THAT WAS OF THERE WAS A HUGE COMMUNITY PROCESS I THINK A LAWSUIT OVER YEAR LOTS OF. FEEDBACK SESSIONS LOTS OF FORUMS. AND THAT'S A VISION FOR WHERE WE'RE GOING AS A CITY WE WE HAVE A DOCUMENT THAT THAT THAT'S OUR GUIDING STAR. I THINK IT'S THE ONE THING I DID WANT TO HIGHLIGHT FROM THIS IS THAT REALLY THE IDEA OF GOING OUT INTO THE COMMUNITY DOING LOTS OF INPUT SESSIONS MEETING BETH PROVIDER ASSOCIATIONS WITH A. THAT LOCAL PLANNING COUNCIL FIRST FIVE ARE. YOU KNOW THE FAMILY CHILDCARE ASSOCIATION MEMBERS WE WENT OUT THE APPARENT VOICES REAL LOT OF WITH A LOT OF FEEDBACK A LOT OF COMMUNITY INPUT BEFORE WE MOVE FORWARD WITH OUR EARLY LEARNING SCHOLARSHIP. WE ARE FUNDING SYSTEM AND THAT WAS LAUNCHED JUST IN JULY LAST YEAR SO WE'RE STILL IN THE FIRST YEAR OF IMPLEMENTATION SO IT'S. YOU KNOW IT'S BEEN INTERESTING. SO THIS AGAIN IS ARE SOME OF THE CITYWIDE PLAN OUR STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK THAT GUIDES ALL WORK YOU CAN SEE THAT THE THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE TOP AROUND BEST A FIVE APPROACH OUR. EQUITY IN DIVERSE CITY QUALITY IMPROVEMENT FAMILY ENGAGEMENT PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND WORK FORCE AND THE FINANCING MODELS AND THE FINANCING MODEL SPECIFICALLY HOURS ARE ONLY GOING SCHOLARSHIP. PROVIDING FEDERAL RATES TO PROVIDERS AND CONTINUITY OF CARE FOR FAMILIES. AND THAT'S WHAT WE'LL BE FOCUSING ON TODAY. I THINK WE ARE TOLD ABOUT THIS AGAIN THIS IS ONE OF OUR OWN OVER ARCHING GOALS AS WE DON'T WANT DISQUALIFYING CIRCUMSTANCES ARE GOING OVER THE INCOME LEVEL FOR. FOR ELIGIBILITY TO BE A BARRIER TO TO COME TO CONTINUITY OF CARE SO ONE OF OUR REAL. OVERARCHING SORT OF FRAMEWORK IS URINE UP TALK IN THE GARDEN AND YOU NO MATTER WHAT. SO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH IS HIGH QUALITY E. C. E. COST IN SAN FRANCISCO. WELL IT MIGHT NOT THIS IS THIS IS SORT OF OUR. THE OVERARCHING KIND OF IDEA BEHIND WHAT ARE ONLY LETTING SCHOLARSHIP BASS. SO WOULD HAVE CENTER RATES AND WE HAVE FAMILY CHILDCARE RIGHTS AND WE HAD A COMPREHENSIVE FISCAL ANALYSIS THAT WAS DONE BY A TEAM IN NATIONAL TEAM THAT CAME OUT TO SAN FRANCISCO. THEY MET WITH CENTER DIRECTORS TEACHERS FAMILIES. FAMILY CHILDCARE PROVIDERS TO TO REALLY LOOK AT BUT YOU KNOW ALL OF THE THINGS THAT WENT INTO OF WHAT IT COSTS TO PROVIDE EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION SERVICES THAT WAS UP LIKE A I THINK A NINE MONTH PROCESS WHERE WE DID THIS REALLY INTENSIVE STE. CFA AM IT'S A TOUCHY AVAILABLE ON OUR WEBSITE WITH ITS VERY DETAIL THE FLIGHT TWO HUNDRED PAGES. AND WHAT WE CAME UP WITH WITH THESE BENCHMARK RATES FOR EACH SAT FOR EACH AGE GROUP WITHIN SANTA AND FCC. SO FOR INFANTS OUR ANNUAL RATE WOULD BE A HIGH QUALITY AND ARE A BENCHMARK IS T. IF THREE OF THE. STATE Q. R. S. SO IS A YOU KNOW TO BE ELIGIBLE TO BE ANOTHER LEADING SCHOLARSHIP. YOU KNOW PROVIDE OF SANTA A FAMILY CHILDCARE. EDUCATOR IN OUR IN OUR NETWORK LIVES A GUARANTEE THAT YOU AYE THAT ALREADY AT TI A THREE OF THE CURE I S. OR. FOR FAMILY CHILDCARE BECAUSE THERE ARE SOME YOU KNOW THAT'S THAT DICK CURIOUS CERTAINLY IS NOT AS ACCESSIBLE AND. IT MAY REQUIRE MORE TIME THERE WAS A COMMIT A COMMITTED A COMMITMENT TO MOVE TOWARDS TO YOU THREE OF THE CURIOUS FOR THE FAMILY CHILDCARE EDUCATION IS. SO WHERE USING TEAR THREE IS A BASELINE SO WHAT WOULD IT COST TO PROVIDE TIER THREE QUALITY E. C. E. IN BOTH CENTERS AND FROM WHICH OUT THERE. AND FOR CENTERS AT WIRED FOR INFINITE WAS TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SIX DOLLARS A YEAR. FOR A TABLA IT'S TWENTY THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE DOLLARS A YEAR AND FOR PRESCHOOL IT WAS SEVENTEEN THOUSAND AND SIXTY NINE DOLLARS A YEAR. AND WE'RE ALREADY GETTING FEEDBACK FROM OUR. NETWORK THAT DUTCH NEWMAN HAAS. THAT THOSE RIGHTS ARE NOT ENOUGH AND STILL DON'T MATCH THE COST OF ACTUALLY PROVIDING HIGH QUALITY CARE IN A COUNTY LIKE SAN FRANCISCO. SO FOR SOME OF OUR. CHILDREN IN THE CITY THAT DON'T A QUALIFY FOR ANY OF ITS FEDERAL STATE SUBSIDIES WE WILL PROVIDE VOUCHERS LOCALLY FUNDED VOUCHERS THAT WOULD PAY THAT FULL RIGHT OF THOSE AMOUNTS UP TO CHEER THAT TIA THREE BASE RIGHT. FOR FOR FAMILIES THAT ARE RECEIVING SUBSIDIES FROM IF TITLE FIVE OR HEAD START OR ST VOUCHERS THE CAL EXPENDITURES WE WILL PAY THE GAP BETWEEN WHAT THE REIMBURSEMENT RATE IS FROM THE STATE'S. UP TO THAT TF THREE LOCAL RIGHT AND THAT'S ABOUT GAP FUNDING TO BRING EVERYBODY UP TO THAT THAT SAME AMOUNT PER CHILD. FOR HEAD START AFTER THE BRAID THEM UNPLANNED FUNDING WITH HEAD START AND TITLE FIVE AGAIN WILL BRIDGE THAT GAP SO THEY CAN BRING IT UP TO THE. THE SAN FRANCISCO RIGHT SO YOU KNOW I ALSO WE HAVE UNIVERSAL PFA FOUGHT THAT IS NOT INCOME. BASED AND WE STILL HAVE TUITION CREDIT FOR FAMILIES REGARDLESS OF INCOME FOR FOUR YEAR OLDS WHO ELIGIBLE FOR PRESCHOOL FOR ALL. SO THAT'S KIND OF ARE WE ARE GOAL EVENTUALLY IS TO GET TWO TIERED REIMBURSEMENTS FOR BOTH TF FOR ANTI A FIVE. A IN THE CURIOUS WE'RE NOT THERE YET BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT CURRENTLY. SO THIS IS A LOT OF THOSE LITTLE THINGS THAT I DIDN'T PUT IN. BUT. YEAH. SO I AGAIN I THINK THIS IS FOR YOUHAVE THIS IN YOUR HANDOUTS IT SHOWS YOU THE RIGHTS ONE THING I JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT HERE THIS OF CENTER. AGAIN ON OUR WEBSITE. IN OUR OPERATING GUIDELINES YOU CAN FIND ALL THE RIGHTS BUT FOUND ITSELF AND CENTERS BUT WE DO PAY A FIVE PERCENT DIFFERENTIAL EVEN ON THE FULL DAY FULL YEAR RIGHTS FOR THOSE ARE PROGRAMS THAT. PROVIDE CONTINUITY OF CARE FROM INFANT THROUGH. FIVE YEAR OLDS SO AGAIN INCENTIVES TO. TO SERVE THE FULL RANGE OF INFANTS TODDLERS AND PRESCHOOLERS BECAUSE. INFANTS AND TODDLERS OF THE BIGGEST UNMET NEED FOR. SERVICES IN SAN FRANCISCO. SO WHAT YOU KNOW WHAT WE'VE AGAIN I MENTIONED THAT WE REALLY WANTED TO UTILIZE STATE AND FEDERAL FUNDING AS PART OF A SCREENING FALL LOCALLY FUNDED SERVICES YOU WANT IT YOU KNOW WE LOOK TO SEE IF A FAMILY IS ELIGIBLE FOR ANY. STATE OR FEDERAL FUNDING BEFORE THEY'RE FULLY REIMBURSED IT OUT OF THE LIVING SCHOLARSHIP RIGHTS WE WANT SIVA FAMILY COMES AND. TO OUR RESOURCE AND REFERRAL AGENCIES. AVAILABLE FOR HEAD START OF ELIGIBLE FOR TITLE FIVE COULD BE ON A CAL EXPENDITURE IF NOT I'LL BE ELIGIBLE FOROAKLAND SCHOLARSHIP AND WILL PAY THE FULL WEIGHT. AS OPPOSED TO JUST THE GAP BETWEEN THE. VERY. AT THE STATE OR FEDERAL. FUNDING. YOU KNOW WHAT WE DO HAVE A PILOT WE ARE A PILOT COUNTY SO WE'RE VERY LUCKY WE HAVE. TWENTY FOUR MONTH ELIGIBILITY AND. EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE SMI IS AN ENTRANCE OF INCOME SO THAT BY HAS MADE A DIFFERENCE AND. YOU KNOW EARLY IN OUR STATE CONTRACTS. SO I THINK YOU KNOW I'VE GONE THROUGH MOST OF WHAT WAS BEFORE AND WHAT WAS WHAT WHAT WE HAVE WITH OUR EARLIER IN SCHOLARSHIPS AS FAR AS YOU KNOW REIMBURSEMENT RATES AND CONTINUITY OF CARE. YOU CAN SEE THAT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN. THE INCOME FOR FAMILIES THAT AT EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT OF YOUR SMI AT SIXTY THREE THOUSAND FOR A FAMILY OF THREE IS THE CLIFF. WITH ARE A HUNDRED AND TEN PERCENT OF THE I AM I IT'S A HUNDRED AND THREE THOUSAND FOR A FAMILY OF THREE SO IT'S A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN EARNINGS BUT A FAMILY COULD MAKE. AND STILL BE ELIGIBLE FOR SOME FORM OF. SUBSIDY TO IT TOOK FOR IT ON THE CARE AND EDUCATION AND AGAIN QUALITY IS APPLIES TO ALL OF OUR. THAT ACCOUNTABILITY AND QUALITY INSURANCES FOR ALL OF THE. INCENTIVES AND AS HE SEES THAT ARE IN OUR. NETWORK. SO SO QUALITY HAS IT YOU KNOW WHAT HAVE WE SEEN ANY IMPACT IN WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON AS FAR AS YOU KNOW WHERE WE HAVE THIS. REQUIREMENT TO TO BE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE CURIOUS TO BE PART OF OUR SYSTEM. AND THIS IS FROM FIRST FIVE SAN FRANCISCO. THE ORANGE AS TWENTY FOURTEEN AND TWENTY SIXTEEN WHETHER IT THIS IS BOTH CENTERS AND FAMILY CHILDCARE PROVIDERS. A COMBINED THE AND THEN THE GREEN. IS A TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN SO YOU CAN SEE THAT WE HAVE WE HAVE NO. NONE OF OUR AGENCIES THAT ARE WITHIN OUR NETWORK UNTIL ONE. WE HAVE VERY FEW INTO YOUR THREE. BUT THE MAJORITY OF OUR PROGRAMS ARE IN T. A FOREIGN TO FIVE. SO WE HAVE YOU KNOW I WE HOPE AND WE WE. WE MAKE SOME ASSUMPTIONS BUT WE THINK THE INVESTMENTS THAT WE'RE MAKING AND QUALITY. DOTA COACHING. ALL THE SUPPORT SYSTEMS THAT WE HAVE IN PLACE FOR A PART OF OUR NETWORK. HAVE ACCESS TO HAVE MADE SOME SIGNIFICANT. YOU KNOW IMPROVEMENTS IN AN HOUR QUALITY SCORES AND FAMILY CHILDCARE BROUGH. EDUCATORS WE HAVE TO FAMILY CHILDCARE QUALITY NETWORKS THAT A HOUSE ABOUT YOU RESOURCE AND REFERRAL AGENCIES AGAIN WE WE FUND THAT'S WHERE OUR OFFICE AND THEY PROVIDE THE COACHING T. A INDIRECT. INVOLVEMENT WITH THE FAMILY CHILDCARE HOMES THAT ARE IN THOSE NETWORK. AND THE FAMILY CHILDCARE HOMES AND UPLAND ABOUT YEAH LET'S PROGRAM ARE REQUIRED TO BE IN THE QUEUE AND A CALL THE NETWORK TO GET THOSE SERVICES. LESSONS LEARNT REIMBURSEMENT RATES SHOULD MEET THE COST OF ACTUAL COST TO PROVIDE IN THE CARE INSTEAD OF FIFTY PERCENT. OR LESS OUR CONTINUITY OF CARE IS VITAL. STARTING EARLY IS VITAL AND ONE TALKS ABOUT YOU KNOW CONSIDER PKB ON START AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE IT'S REALLY VITAL TO PROVIDE THAT SUPPORT FOR ZERO OF THREE YEAR OLDS AS WELL AS THREE AND FOUR YEAR OLDS. CHILDCARE CLIFFS AND WE NEED TO BE SMOOTHED YOU KNOW THOSE EDGES JUST NEED TO BE SMOOTH SO TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR FAMILIES. YOU KNOW THE EXISTING SUBSIDY SYSTEM OF OF DIFFERENT AGES YOU KNOW REQUIREMENTS FOR THE REFUND THAT YOU KNOW WHAT YOU MAY HAVE THE VOUCHERS AND A. BIT THEY HAVE DIFFERENT AGE CATEGORIES FOR INFANTS TODDLERS AND PRESCHOOLERS JUST LIKE IT CAN GET REALLY COMPLICATED WAY TRYING TO WORK WITH IN A FRAGMENTED SYSTEM. SO YOU KNOW UP AND MIXED DELIVERY SYSTEM IS VITAL WE FOUND THAT WE WORK WITH YOU KNOW BOTH OF A FAMILY CHILDCARE EDUCATORS AND A SIX COMMITTEE BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND A SCHOOL DISTRICT. AND. DATA IS BEING YOU KNOW WE REALLY NEED A CAR A CONSOLIDATED DATA TO BE ABLE TO DO THE WORK THAT WE DO IN SAM'S US GOING THAT'S AN ONGOING STRUGGLE FOR US IN THE WORKING ON THAT. IT'S CHALLENGING THAT'S OF THAT'S THEY GO THAT'S A LESSON LEARNED IT'S VERY CHALLENGING. BRIGHT SPOTS WE'VE IMPROVED THE LEVERAGING OF STATE AND FEDERAL DOLLARS FOR ELIGIBLE CHILDREN BECAUSE WHERE GIVEN AN INCENTIVE AFFECT FOR FOR PROGRAMS TO IN THOSE DOLLARS NOW AND TAKE THOSE VIRUSES. AND USE TITLE FIVE DOLLARS BECAUSE WE PAY THE DIFFERENCE INSTEAD OF GETTING. EL EVERY EMBRACE RAY THAT DOESN'T YOU BECAUSE OF CARE TO COUNT YOUR COUNSELING IN THE RED WAY SAY WE'LL PAY YOU MORE ON TOP OF THAT TIED TO TO SERVE THOSE CHILDREN. CONTINUITY OF CARE. AND WE WERE PART OF OUR SYSTEM IS E. SIGNATURE LOOKING TO ELECT ELECTRONIC SIGNATURE SYSTEM ACROSS THE BOARD TO CAPTURE ABOUT DATA REALLY. SIMPLY WE HAVE HAD SOME BRIGHT SPOTS WITH ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR OUR SYSTEM SPECIFICALLY HOMELESS CHILDREN AND FOR INFANTS TODDLERS AND WE HAVE A BALLOT MEASURE GOING ON IN JUNE TO RAISE ANOTHER HUNDRED AND FORTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR OUR ELF SYSTEM. WHICH WOULD BE AMAZING IF THAT PASSES. IT'S BEEN A MASS OF. SYSTEM CHANGE IN SAN FRANCISCO AND NOT HAS NOT BEEN WITHOUT ITS. ROCKY ROADS DISPERSED YEAR I THINK WE FOUND THAT WE MOVED FROM A FUNDING PER SITE MODEL THAT WE HAD DIFFERENT STRATEGIES TO ADDRESS DIFFERENT EIGHT AREAS OF THE FIELD. SOMETHING FOR A COMPENSATION SOMETHING FOR INFANTS AND TODDLERS SOMETHING FOR. QUALITY AND WHAT WE'VE DONE IS WE'VE AMALGAMATED ALL OF THOSE DIFFERENT FUNDING STREAMS INTO ONE EARLY LEARNING SCHOLARSHIP WHICH IS A CHILD BASED. YOU KNOW FEE FOR SERVICE BASED ON CHILDREN ENROLLMENT SO THAT WAS A HUGE SYSTEM SHIFT AND. CHANGE IS DIFFICULT AND THAT PROGRAMS THAT WERE CUT WE WILL BE IN FUNDED BY THE CITY WHEN WE BROUGHT IN THIS NEW SYSTEM DEFINITELY THERE WAS SOME. CHALLENGES TO DOUBT ABOUT CHANGING HOW WE WORK FUND IN THE. SERVICES. WE DIDN'T HAVE A VERY LONG TIMELINE FOR PLANNING AND. IMPLEMENTATION SO THAT WAS WE HAD A QUICK TURNAROUNDS ARE ALL HAPPENED WAY TOO QUICKLY. AND YOU KNOW THIS IDEA YOU KNOW I THINK ARE. ARMED SERVICES BY ABOUT ENROLLMENT BEGETTING CHILDREN IN SPACE EMPTY SPACES IN PROGRAMS AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE WE WERE ALREADY BUILDING ON OF OUR SYSTEM THAT WASN'T AS EFFICIENT AS WE SHOULD HAVE. BEEN OUR OUR. ELIGIBILITY LIST WE HAD WE STILL HAVE A CENTRALIZED ELIGIBILITY LIST IN SAN FRANCISCO WE HAD WE KEPT THAT ON AFTER THE STATE DEFUNDED THOSE AND SO OUR SYSTEM DOES WASN'T READY FOR THIS NEW CHANGE A IN THIS AND ASSIST THEM IN THIS SPAWNING. A SYSTEM AND SO WE HAD SOME YOU KNOW WE HAD SOME. THE FIRST FEW MONTHS IT WAS WE WERE GETTING CHILDREN THOSE EMPTY SPACES AS QUICKLY AS WE SHOULD HAVE AND SO THAT WAS A THAT WAS A CHALLENGE. AND AGAIN THE DATA SYSTEMS I THINK OUR. I'VE BEEN A CHALLENGING SO WORK ON DATA SYSTEMS ARE WORKING ON YOU ELIGIBILITY LIST. SO THAT WAS QUICK SORRY I KNEW THAT WE WERE KIND OF RUNNING OUT OF TIME BUT THANK YOU. I'LL START OFF WITH WITH A FEW QUESTIONS. I AM THE MIKE HERE SO. I I KINDA BLAND IS THAT COMMISSION HAD AND. MY BUDGET AT SO I OVERSEE THAT BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE FOR EASY. AND. LOOKING AT THAT THE STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM IN THE RATE STRUCTURE AND BASIC YOUR CARE FAMILIES THAT ARE NOW IN SAN FRANCISCO. YOU KNOW WE'VE WE'VE INCREASED. SLOTS LAST FEW YEARS AS WELL AS. MARGINALLY NOT LARGELY BUT WE'VE INCREASED RATES. AT LAST FEARS AS WELL SO HOW'S THAT SORTING OUT IN TRYING TO TO FIND FAMILIES THAT THAT MATCHED THE OPPORTUNITY THAT THAT WERE. PUTTING OUT FROM CD FOR STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM. OUT I MEAN I'D THAT'S A INTEGRAL PART OF OUR SYSTEM I MEAN THAT BIG THIS I THINK I HOPE THE MAJORITY OF THE PROGRAMS THAT WE WORK WITH THE CENTERS THAT WE WORK WITH AN AYE EE LSI EARLY ON IN SCHOLARSHIP. OUR TITLE FIVE PROGRAM I GET THAT BUT BUT ARE YOU HAVING TROUBLE FINDING FAMILIES WHAT I'M SAYING ARE ARE ARE ARE UTILIZING ALL THE RESOURCES THAT WE ARE GIVING YOU FROM THE STATE SONS DISTRICT SOME COMMUTER THING. RAMMING A TOUGH TIME WHEN YOU'RE NOT BUT WE DOING BETTER. AND I THINK PART TWO OF THE THINGS I THINK THAT YOU KNOW WE SO WE WERE AS A PILOT COUNTY WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT. EARNINGS OF OUR CONTRACTS VERY VERY CLOSELY OVER THE LAST TWELVE YEARS AND WE'VE SEEN THIS YEAR THAT WE'RE DOING BETTER THAN WE DID LAST YEAR. TO THE THINGS I THINK ONE THE LS THIS THIS REIMBURSEMENT RATE THIS INCENTIVE TO EARN THE CONTRACT BECAUSE IT'S YOU'RE NOT GETTING. THEM THE STATE RIGHT. IS AN INCENTIVE TO TO USE THOUGH TO ENROLL MORE CHILDREN INSTEAD OF TAKING A LOT OF OUR PROGRAMS ARE MIXED INCOME NOW HAVE FAMILIES THAT PAY FEES AS WELL AND SO REDUCING THEM NUMBER OF PHOEBE OUR FAMILY FEE. FAMILIES BUT TAKEN MORE A TITLE FIVE MORE VOUCHER CHILDREN FOR EXAMPLE BECAUSE WE PAY IN ON TOP OF THAT SO IT'S NOT BECAUSE THAT THAT REIMBURSE ALL RIGHT UP FROM THE STATE IS. IS ENCOURAGING THEM TO DO IT BUT BECAUSE WAY HELPING SUPPORT THEM AND MEETING LIKE THE COST OF PROVIDING CARE AND THEN THE OTHER THING THAT I THINK HAS MADE A DIFFERENCE OF SOME OF THE STATE. POLICIES THAT HAVE CHANGED RECENTLY STATEWIDE WE HAVE TWELVE MONTH ELIGIBILITY ONCE YOU AND YOUR GOOD FOR TWELVE MONTHS UNLESS THERE'S BEEN A CHANGE YOU KNOW TO THAT OF THE INCOME LEVEL AND FOR IN THE IN SOME CISCO WE HAVE TWENTY FOUR MONTH ELIGIBILITY THE SAME AS THE PILOT COUNTIES. AND SO I THINK THAT AGAIN THAT THAT. FOCUS ON ELIGIBILITY AND AND FAMILY ALL YOUR FAMILY ELIGIBILITY IN TAKING THAT AWAY A LITTLE BIT IT'S BEEN YOU KNOW YOU'RE GOOD FOR A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME. HAS MEANT BACK AGAIN THAT THERE'S MORE. OPPORTUNITIES FOR PROGRAMS TO USE THOSE. THAT THAT THE STATE FUNDING OKAY WHILE YOU'RE HERE YOU CARE PRACTITIONER OF WE HAD OUR LAST HEARING. DOWN IN THE DESERT AND WE HEARD FROM. THE AREA DOWN THERE THE RIVERSIDE SCHOOL DISTRICT TALKING ABOUT. THE. THAT T. K. OPPORTUNITIES AND STATE PRESCHOOL AND HOW DOES HOW TO SAN FRANCISCO. CAN MANAGE THAT WITH THE IF YOU HAVE A. KID THAT'S BORN. IN MARCH AND SO THEY'RE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR TEA QUE CAN BUT THEY COULD BE ELIGIBLE MADE YEAR WHAT WHAT ARE YOU DOING THERE ARE YOU TO ENROLL THEM PART YEAR AND AND HOW HAS THAT WORKED. YOU KNOW WHAT'S UP TO THAT I MEAN THAT'S A FAMILY CHOICE IT'S LIKE WE WE WILL ENROLL A CHILD FOR AS LONG AS THEY NEED TO BE BEFORE THEY GO INTO THE SCHOOL DISTRICT TO MATT AND I DO YOU ENROLL THEM IN THE STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM AND. AND THEN MID YEAR TRANSITION OR HOW DO YOU DO THAT WE DON'T DO WE WE DON'T HAVE A SPECIFIC. POLICY AROUND. STATE PRESCHOOL ON T. QUE YOU KNOW AGAIN I THINK THAT HAPPENS I THINK SOMETIMES A FAMILY MIGHT START IT IN THE STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM AND THEN REALIZE THAT THERE'S A T. K. PROGRAM WITH SPACES DOWN THE ROAD. AND THEY DO HAVE TO PAY A FEE THAT FOR EXAMPLE BECAUSE IT'S A SCHOOL DISTRICT SO I CAN I THINK THAT'S A LOT OF PARENTAL CHOICE WE DON'T. WE WE DON'T GIVE ANY INSTRUCTIONS TO OUR PROGRAMS OUT WHETHER. WHAT AGES I STRESSED ABOUT IT BUT HAVE YOU FIGURED OUT HOW TO BREED THAT TO TO HELP THE FAMILIES IS? METAL FINANCES NOW SHORT ANSWER IS NO AREA SOMEONE MEMBER I HAVE A FOUR AND A HALF YEAR OLD WHO'S TWENTY FIVE SEPTEMBER SEVENTH AND I CAN WALK YOU THROUGH. WHAT AT INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT AND CHALLENGING STRESSFUL PROCESSES YET WE DON'T I DON'T KNOW I MENTIONED THAT ARE LESS YEAH? I COMMISSIONER*. SO YOU TALKED ABOUT HOW YOU BOOTH TO QUALITY STANDARDS THAT VARY BY SETTING AND THEN NOW IT'S THE SAME HIGH QUALITY STANDARDS FOR ALL OF HER SETTINGS WHAT HAVE YOU LEARNED ABOUT THE WORK FORCE THERE YOU MENTIONED COMPENSATION YOU MENTIONED CHO CHANG COME. WELL. COMPENSATION IS PROBABLY THAT THE BIGGEST. CHALLENGE THAT WE HAVE IN TERMS OF STORE EVERY. MEETING THAT WE HAVE WITH OUR GRANTEES THAT TO MEAN THAT WE TRY TO THE COMMUNITY. THAT THE CAUSE OF THE WORK FORCE CRISIS SOMETIME FRANCISCO WE HAVE CLASSROOMS THAT AREN'T OPEN BECAUSE. PROGRAMS CONFINED TEACHERS TO WORK IN THOSE CLASSROOMS. ONE OF THE FOR THE A ONE OF THE. I THINK. SO THE CAN SO COMPENSATION IS INCORPORATED YOU KNOW THE WAGES WERE INCORPORATED AS PART OF THE FISCAL ANALYSIS AS TO WHAT YOU KNOW WHAT THE. PEOPLE WE ALSO INSTEAD OF TIME TO WAGE SPECIFIC INITIATIVE WHICH WE USED TO HAVE WE SAW WITH THE HIGHER REIMBURSEMENT RATE PER CHILD WE THOUGHT THAT WAS ABSOLVED IN THIS IN THIS NEW SCHOLARSHIP. WHAT WE WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT AGAIN WE'RE JUST HEARING THAT IT'S NOT ENOUGH YOU KNOW THAT THAT THAT THAT? LOW WAGES GONE OUTWILL HAVE BEEN MINIMAL WE'RE LOOKING AT MINIMUM COMPENSATION ELEMENTS THAT WOULD BRING UP. THE MINIMUM WAGE WITH CITY FUNDED PROGRAMS OF ABOVE THE MINIMUM WAGE IF YOU KNOW UP TO A SIXTEEN OVER SIXTEEN DOLLARS AN HOUR. SO EVERYTHING WHAT YOU KNOW IT'S WE JUST CAN'T KEEP UP WITH WHAT WHAT THAT. EDUCATORS NEED TO MAKE IT SHOULD BE MAKING. SO. IN THIS ISSUE BALLOT MEASURE THAT'S COMMAND JUNE IF IT PASSES A LOT OF THE LANGUAGES AROUND COMPENSATION FOR. THE EDUCATORS OF THE POT OF IDEALISTS. SO INCREASE THE REIMBURSEMENT RATES TO TO TO SPECIFICALLY ADDRESS THAT BUT WE DO HAVE A PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT PIECE THAT'S THE WORK THAT WE DO SO IT'S VERY SPECIFIC WE HAVE A WHOLE QUALITY PEOPLE. PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT. SORT OF. WORK THAT'S PART OF OUR OFFICE SPENDS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT YOU KNOW SYSTEM EVERYWHERE PREFERS FIVE WE WORK WITH A HIGH RIGHT TO INSTITUTIONS WE WORK WITH THE SCHOOL DISTRICT AROUND. ACCESS TO OPT FOR A EDUCATORS THE TEACHERS IN THE FAMILY CHALK ALLIGATORS. TWO TRAININGS IN WORKSHOPS AND ONGOING EDUCATION. THANK YOU COMMISSIONER UNLEASHES. WE FINISHED. EVER. GRAHAM SINCE THIS IS THE FINANCING AND A CONVERSATION I I DON'T KNOW DID YOU DESCRIBE I MEAN. THESE LOCAL DOLLARS CAME OUT OF A PREVIOUS BALLOT INITIATIVE WE DID YES BUT YEAH BUT YOU KNOW WE HAD. A PROPERTY TAX SET ASIDE FOR OUR CHILDREN'S FUND. AND THEN WHICH A PORTION OF THAT GOES TO ZERO TO FIVE YEAR OLD SO THAT USED TO BE HAS HAD A DEPARTMENT OF CHILDREN YOUTH AND FAMILIES AND THAT THE FUNDING THAT'S ALLOCATED TO ZERO TO FIVE IS NOW. UNDER A HOUSE THEN FIRST IN FIRST FIVE USED TO RUN OUR PRESCHOOL FOR ALL INITIATIVE AND THAT WAS FUNDED BY A GENERAL FUND SET ASIDE WHICH IS THE PUBLIC EDUCATION IN RICHMOND FUND. AGAIN THAT FUNDING WAS WAS ALLOCATED OVER TO OUR OFFICE TO KEEP IT UNDER ONE ROOF. AND THEN WE HAVE SOME. WE ALSO. ADMITS TO SOME CAL WORK SOME STATE DOLLARS THAT'S PART OF THAT BUT THAT THE MAJORITY OF OUR MONEY IS A. AND THAT WE HAVE GENERAL FUND AS WELL SOME GENERAL FUND SO IT'S TO SET ASIDES GENERAL FUND AND SOME STATE FUNDING WE HAVE A A BUDGET AND OUR OFFICE OF ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN MILLION. CAN YOU BREAK DOWN HOW MUCH OF THAT WAS THESE SET ASIDES AND LOCAL VERSES WHAT STATE. I SHOULD BE ABLE TO ABOUT HOW. BUT I GET THAT TO YOU A AND I DIDN'T THAT'S WE IT WAS IN THE OTHER PART. POWER POINT I TOOK IT OUT BECAUSE I THOUGHT YOU WOULD BE INTERESTED. COMMISSIONER MCMILLAN. SO I THINK. WHAT YOU REPRESENT IT IS REMARKABLE ESPECIALLY WITH WHAT CHIU BUT YOU GUYS HAVE DONE IN SUCH A SHORT? TIME FRAME I THINK IT'S AMAZING AYE. I HAVE A DREAM. NOT MARTIN LUTHER KING'S MY OWN. AND AYE ADD TEN. A LOT OF TOWN HALLS ALLOTTED CANDIDATES RUNNING FOR. SEATS AND SO FORTH. AND I ALWAYS HEAR THEM SAY. I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT FAMILIES HAVE JOBS THAT THEY CAN GO TO THAT THEIR KIDS CAN GET INTO. WHATEVER COLLEGE THEY WANT TO BUT NOT ONCE. HAVE I HEARD THEM SAY. I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT FAMILIES HAVE JOBS AND THEY CAN GO TO THAT PAY THEM WELL AND THAT THEIR CHILDREN AND THEIR BABIES. CAN HAVE QUALITY EARLY EDUCATION AND CARE NOT ONCE. I THINK WHAT YOU HAVE HERE. MIGHT CHANGE. THAT CONVERSATION. I'M HOPING. THAT THIS WOULD BE THE BEGINNING OF CHANGE IN THAT CONVERSATION AND MY DREAM IS THAT I CAN GO TO A TOWN HALL. AND HEAR WHAT I JUST SAID. WE LET'S START AT THE BEGINNING DON'T JUMP TO THE END. START AT THE BEGINNING AND MAYBE IF WE USE THAT TARGET UNIVERSALISM THEM WE DON'T HAVE TO HAVE THE. TEACHER BRING THE CHILDREN WE CAN HELP THE CHILDREN BRING THE TEACHER. BUT I'M I'M SO IMPRESSED WITH THIS AND I DEFINITELY WANNA LEARN MORE ABOUT IT COME TO SEND THIS GOD WILL FORGIVE YOU TO. SHOW UP THANK YOU OKAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU COMMISSION ELECT. WELL I COULD ASK A DOZEN QUESTIONS BUT I WON'T. THE ONE THAT I'M REALLY INTERESTED IN IS AS YOU SORT OF RAISE THE RATE YOU TALKED ABOUT HAVING TROUBLE GETTING TEACHERS NOT HAVING CLASSROOM BUT I'M. I'M WONDERING YOUR SEEING ANYTHING IN TERMS OF SUPPLY. A WORST ARE DO YOU STILL HAVE A LOT OF FAMILIES THAT ARE USING. UNLICENSED CARE OR OTHER MECHANISMS SO A HIGH PERCENTAGE OF FAMILIES AND SAN FRANCISCO WITH VOUCHERS ARE ACTUALLY USING LICENSED. CARRIED AN UNLICENSED I MEAN LIKE YOU KNOW FAMILY FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS IN SIMON'S DISCO WE YOU KNOW. WHAT THE NEXT PHASE I YOU KNOW TO TO YOUR POINT ABOUT FAMILY FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS AND WHAT ARE WE DOING THERE THAT'S THE NEXT PHASE AND WE'VE ACTUALLY JUST PUT OUT? SOME GRANT FUNDING YOU KNOW FOR BILL TO APPLY FOR AND ONE OF YOUR FOR INNOVATIVE IDEAS AND ONE OF THEM IS AROUND WORKING WITH FAMILY FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS AND MAYBE LOOKING AT TI HAD A HIGHER REIMBURSEMENT RATES FOR THOSE. FAMILY FRIEND AND NEIGHBOR PROVIDERS WHO WOULD LIKE TO DO SOME QUALITY WORKSHOPS AND GET SOME TRAINING AND BE PART OF THE SYSTEM AND GET A HIGHER REIMBURSEMENT RIGHT TO PROVIDE CARE FOR THE FOR THE CHILDREN. SO THAT'S WHAT I NEXT PHASE YOU KNOW THIS IS STILL LIKE I SAID AS A FIRST YEAR OF IMPLEMENTATION AND SO IT'S YOU KNOW WE'RE STILL WELL LEARNING AS WE GO. BUT WE YOU KNOW I YOU KNOW WE ALSO SEE THAT POTENTIALLY. I THINK BACK TO. COULD BE A PATHWAY FOR I THINK THAT WAS MENTIONED BEFORE FOR FOR A FAMILY FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS TO MAYBE GOING TO LICENSE CAFE GET IF THEY GET A TASTE OF IT THROUGH SOME QUALITY WORKSHOPS AND TRAININGS. SPORT BUT. YEAH I THINK YOU KNOW WE WE ARE LUCKY WE DO HAVE BUT I THINK WE HAVE A PRETTY GOOD SUPPLY. WHERE WHAT WE'RE NOT AWARE OF THIS YOU KNOW I MEAN ALL THE NEED AND YOU KNOW INFANT TODDLER? KAREN AND EDUCATION IS IS A A BIGGEST UNMET NEED AND HOUSE HAS BEEN FOR DECADES AND SO WE REALLY WANT TO INCENTIVIZE. OF SAN DOESN'T FROM WHICH ALL CARE OWNERS TO. TO SERVE GOD ZERO THREE POPULATION THAT'S OUR BIGGEST STRUGGLE. WHERE I PROBABLY NINETY FIVE PERCENT OF PRESCHOOLERS TO ELIGIBLE BE IN MORE THAN NINETY FIVE PERCENT FOR SUBSIDIES WHO ARE? ARE ARE IN SOME FORM OF SERVICES SO WE'RE DOING VERY WELL RESULT THAT'S REMARKABLE. PAY ARE ACTUALLY REPORTS A HUNDRED TWENTY SEVEN PERCENT. TARGETED UNIVERSALIST. YES LISTENER WITH THE. GRAHAM THANK YOU ALWAYS A PLEASURE TO HEAR FROM YOU AND FIGURE OUT THE FUN STUFF IS A COW AS A SOME FRANCISCO RESIDENT MYSELF I ALWAYS LIKE TO WHAT WE DO. THERE AS WELL. AND I'M CURIOUS ABOUT THE COMPETITIVE NATURE OF THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING THAT YOU'RE PUTTING OUT ALL OF THEM ARE A CREATURE TRIES ABOUT SEVENTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS RIGHT FOR PRESCHOOLER PER YEAR WHICH IS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THE STANDARD RAM. RIGHT CURRENTLY ACROSS THE STATE. HOW COMPETITIVE IS THAT TO A PRIVATE PAY PROGRAM? NOT. NO WORK LAUGHS NO WE HAVE WE'VE WE'VE JUST LOOKED AT SOME AYE WE HAVE WE HAVE SOME INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT SOME PRIVATE. WILL WRECKED MY RECOGNIZING THAT EVEN ARE HIGHER ELF CIVILIANS COST RATES ON MEETING SOME OF THE PRIVATE PAY RIGHTS. IN THE CITY AND SO WE DO HAVE SOME. PRIVATE FOR PROFIT AGENCIES ARE A PART OF ALL PRO A NETWORK WHO ARE PRIMARILY SERVE A. PRIVATE PAIN FAMILIES BUT WANT TO SAVE SOME. SOME SUBSIDY ELIGIBLE FAMILIES WITHIN OUT WITHIN OUR FUNDING SOURCE AND WILL LOOK THROUGH THE DIFFERENCES AND WAY NOT MEETING THE RIGHTS THAT THAT CHARGING THAT FAMILIES. SO EVEN WITH YELL AESTHETIC A LOS. WITH THERATES UP THEY WOULD NORMALLY CHARGE TO SERVE THE FAMILIES THAT WE FIND SO WE ARE SEEING THAT IT'S NOT WHEN NOT BAD COMPETITORS COMPETITIVE WAS IT AS WE PEOPLE. DO YOU KNOW ABOUT WHAT PERCENTAGE REDUCE. I DON'T BUT I CAN GET THE INFORMATION TO MY HOUSE I WOULD BE INTERESTING BECAUSE I MEAN CERTAINLY AS WE'RE LOOKING AT WORKFORCE ISSUES WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT COMPENSATION ONE WERE LOOKING AT CAPACITY ISSUES. ACTUALLY FOR ZERO THREE I THINK THE REALLY INTERESTING YOU KNOW WHAT THE OTHER GOING RATES ARE AND ONE PERCENT IT IS EVEN. WE HAVE SUBMIT INFORMATION I CAN GET THAT I'LL BE HAPPY TO SHARE THAT WITH THE COMMISSION. THANK YOU DOCTOR MACROSS. HERE ALL. REALLY INTEREST. BUT YEAH HER VERY INTERESTING CONFLUENCE OF PRESENTATIONS THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH BUT I I REALLY HAVE TO ADD. AND SOMEWHAT UNUSUAL COMPLEMENT CRAMP WHICH IS THAT IN LA WERE VERY INSPIRED BY THE WORK YOU'RE DOING IN SAN FRANCISCO. AND. IN PARTICULAR INSPIRED BY THE IDEA OF REALLY TENDER ENDING A COMPREHENSIVE FINANCIAL ANALYSIS WE'VE BEEN DOING SOME. COUNTING OF STAY IN AND FEDERAL SUBSIDY FUNDS THAT COME IN THAT FLOW INTO ARE COUNTING ON A REGULAR BASIS. BUT WE'RE NOT INCLUDING EVERYTHING AND WE OBVIOUSLY WE DON'T HAVE THE. THE HISTORY OF THE LOCAL INVESTMENT THAT YOU DO BUT. HOPE WE GET A LOT OF INVESTMENTS OUT THERE AND COORDINATING THEM IS NOT A BAD THING TO DO ALRIGHT. SO WE'RE ACTUALLY ALREADY IN DISCUSSION WITH THE SAME TEAM THAT YOU YOU WRITE YOUR FINAL ANALYSIS. AND HITS SO IT'S JUST A REALLY WONDERFUL SHOT IN THE ARM FOR US TO BE ABLE TO SAY THEY DIDN'T SAN FRANCISCO EVEN THOUGH WE GOT MORE THAN ONE CITY IN ONE. SCHOOL DISTRICT AND SO FORTH AND SO ON BUT IT IT'S REALLY INSPIRE AND AND VERY VERY HELPFUL TO HEAR YOUR. UPDATED REPORT ABOUT WHAT THE SORT OF NEXT CHALLENGES ARE GREAT THANK YOU. THE COMMISSIONER COMPASS YOU'RE BETTER. I THINK YOU THINK YOU HAVE THE FOR YOUR GREAT PRESENTATION JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY WHEN BOTH AYE WHEN BOTH THAT. THE SET ASIDE THE INITIATIVES ARE PUT IN THE AND THE BALANCE. AND I'M NOT EVEN SURE WHAT YOU'RE TWENTY SIXTEEN WOULD WELL ACTUALLY THERE YEAH THEY WILL DO A BOTH REALLY. WE. THE BILL WOULD REBOOTED NOTS UP WHITE FAMILY THEY WORK THEIR WAY OUT DAY WHEN WE AUTHORIZED RECENTLY AND AND TWENTY SIXTEEN. BOTH OF THOSE SET ASIDES I MENTION UNDER ONE CHILDREN YOU FUND. CAN YOU TELL ME A LITTLE BIT OF I'M WHAT YOUR COMMUNICATION STRATEGY WAS FOR YOUR GENERAL AUDIENCE FOR THEM TO UNDERSTAND. YOU JUST YOUR AVERAGE FAMILY TO UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF INVESTMENTS IN EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION COMMERCIALS ANYWHERE OR. WHAT DID YOU HEAR THAT RELEASED IT WAS A VERY GRASSROOTS EFFORT AYE BILLY I WOULD SAY THAT THE STATE'S? SOME JUST BECAUSE A VERY. YOU KNOW POLITICAL CITY AND I AND IT WAS GRASSROOTS IT WAS BEEN AT THE BART STATIONS IT WAS BEYOND THE MANY STATIONS IT WAS PARENT VOICES IT WAS. IT WAS OUT OF THE THE EDUCATED THE FAMILY CHILDCARE ASSOCIATION. PEOPLE REALLY RALLIED AROUND AND GOT THE MESSAGE OUT THERE AND I HAVE TO SAY EVEN THOUGH WE KNOW WE MAY HAVE A SMALL A CHILD POPULATION IN SAN FRANCISCO. ATTEND WE TEND TO BE A PRETTY LIBERAL VOTING CITY WHERE I DOT SUPPORT CHILDREN AND YOUTH. INITIATIVES AND SO I THINK WE HAVE A VERY. AND. POPULATION MAY WHO ARE OPEN TO THAT EVEN IF YOU DON'T HAVE CHILDREN THEMSELVES. I SEE THE VALUE IN THAT BUT YEAH I MEAN. I'D YOU KNOW WITH AS A AS A CITY AGENCY WAY NOT ABLE TO DO THAT ADVOCACY OURSELVES SO I THINK IT IT FELL ON. YOU KNOW OUR IN OUR IS ARCHED CENTERS ARE ARE. ALL PARENTS IN THOSE PROGRAMS TO GO OUT WE GET THE WORD OUT. OKAY. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION. PRE SHAVE YOUR CONTRIBUTION. OKAY WITH THAT WE WILL GO NOW TO. THIRD PART OF OUR AGENDA THE SUBCOMMITTEE. PORTS. BUT BEFORE WE DO THAT WEJUST WANTED TO TO RUN THROUGH. Q. SLIDES ON ON OVER ALL. I KIND OF WHAT WE'RE WHAT WE WERE. LOTS TO DO IN THE FIRST PLACE AS A SPEAKER ALLUDED TO SO. THERE ON THE SPOT ON THE YEAH POWER POINT OF COURSE BUT THIS THAT COMMISSION. S. VISION WAS ASPIRATIONAL LOOKING AT TEN. BASICALLY THAT LONG TERM SYSTEMS PROGRAMS AND FINANCING. STEPS IN THE IMMEDIATE AND SHORT TERM. FUNDING ISSUES FEDERAL STATE AND LOCAL. AND THAT THE ROLE OF PHILANTHROPY IN BUSINESS. OF COURSE WHAT WE WANTED LOOK AT. WHAT THE SYSTEM SHOULD LOOK LIKE FOR? PROVIDERS TEACHERS FAMILIES. APPRECIATE THE DISCUSSION NAY ON ON EQUITY IN DISPARITIES. AGAIN FINANCING WHAT THE STATE TO PROVIDE AS WELL AS WHAT'S NEEDED TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE. HIGH QUALITY PROGRAMS MEETING OUR NEEDS. INFRASTRUCTURE FACILITIES COMPENSATION CERTAIN ISSUES THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT. AND THEN WE ALSO WHEN WE BEGAN THIS PROCESS. AFTER A CAPPELLA MEETING OR TWO REALLY WANTED TO FOCUS ON HOW TO GET DIG A LITTLE DEEPER AND SOME OF HIS ISSUES SO WE. INTRODUCE THE IDEA OF HAVING SUB COMMITTEES. A DIGGING A MORE SPECIFICALLY. INDIA TOPICS THAT FINANCING AND ECONOMIC IMPACT. ACCESS WORK FORCE AND MEETING THE NEEDS OF FAMILIES. AND AGAIN THAT SUBCOMMITTEE TENTATIVE PLAN. IS. IT'S PAST SPRING IDYLLIC AN OUTLINE. ON ON THE ISSUES. THEY THERE IS FOR DISCUSSION AND. HOPEFULLY COMING CLOSE TO WHERE THE RIG WENT AHEAD WITH RECOMMENDATIONS IN A PROCESS FROM NOW UNTIL OCTOBER. AT DEVELOPING A DRAFT RECOMMENDATIONS. NOVEMBER DECEMBER. COST ESTIMATES. PHASES IMPLEMENTATION. AND THEN IN TWENTY NINETEEN. JANUARY AND MARCH. A REPORTS COMING OUT WILL REVIEW THAT HAVE A REVIEW WITH US STAKEHOLDERS. AND. STATE AGENCY STAFF AS WELL AS PROVIDERS THROUGHOUT THE. STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND DEBORAH FINAL DRAFT AND I WILL NOTE THIS WILL BE RIGHT ABOUT THE TIME WILL HAVE A NEW GOVERNOR. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO WE THINK IT'S A. A VERY TIMELY APPROACH THAT HOPEFULLY. BACK INTO THAT THAT COULD SERVICE WELL AS WE LOOK TO. TO EXPAND ECM TWENTY NINETEEN AND BEYOND. OKAY SO WITH THAT WE WILL. HERE FROM OUR FOR SUB. RIGHT NOW. AND WE'LL START WITH THE SUBCOMMITTEE. FINANCING. AND ECONOMIC IMPACT OF BC. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR A CHAIR. I I'LL BE REPORTING ON THIS TODAY. I AM ONE OF THE MEMBERS BUT WE HAVE OUR TWO CO CHAIRS NINA BOOTY. ANSONIA AND COMPLETELY BETTER WHO ME SHIP JUMPING IN. AND OUT BUT SO TIMELY BECAUSE AS. EVIDENCED BY THE PRESENTATION EARLIER TODAY. OUT WE HAVE DONE A LOT OF RESEARCH ON THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES REPORT. ON NOT JUST TODAY BUT I'M OBVIOUSLY AND FELLOWSHIP I WORKED ON THE COMMITTEE AND THE NATIONAL COMMITTEE AND SOME OF US HAVE TAKEN THE PIECES APART IN HAVE BEEN DISCUSSING IT. AND WILL CONTINUE TO LOOK AT THAT. THE OTHER IS THE. LEARNING POLICY INSTITUTE REPORT AS WELL AS THE LABOR. REPORT FROM UC BERKELEY. CAN I GO TO THE NEXT ONE OKAY THEN I CREATING. A FINANCING STRUCTURE THAT ULTIMATELY INCORPORATES THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF ALL OF THE OTHER COMMITTEES. BECAUSE WE NEED TO LOOK AT WHAT ARE WE GONNA NEED IN TERMS OF THE WORK FORCE I WOULD WE GONNA NEED IN TERMS OF PROVIDING ACCESS. I'M IN AGAIN WHETHER IT'S TARGETED UNIVERSALISM OR UNIVERSALISM AND THEN WHAT ARE WE GOING TO NEED A IN TERMS OF FUNDING. THE ENGAGING FAMILIES TO SUPPORT THEIR CHILDREN IN THE CARE AND EDUCATION OF THEIR INFANTS TODDLERS AND PRESCHOOLERS. SO IDENTIFYING ON DEDICATED FUNDING SOURCES FOR OF WELL FUNDED SYSTEM AND YOU'VE HEARD A LOT OF THAT IN THE PREVIOUS PRESENTATIONS. THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT WHAT ARE THE LOCAL. STATE FEDERAL DOLLARS BUT AS WELL AS POTENTIAL PRIVATE FUNDING SOURCES. ARE LOOKING AT THE PRIORITIES FOR INITIAL INVESTMENT I YOU'VE ALREADY HEARD WE'RE NOT THINKING ABOUT THIS IN A ONE YEAR. BUT THEY WILL TAKE THIS TIME TO GET THERE SO WHAT IS IT THAT WE NEED TO DO FIRST. HOW DO WE NEED AND THE NEEDS OF THE FAMILIES AND CHILDREN TO ENSURE EQUITY? AND I'D YOU'VE HEARD FROM I AM MANY OF THE PRESENTERS AND IN THE MEMBERS UP HERE. OF THE COMMISSION THAT A BIG GAP IS IN THE INFANT TODDLER AREA SO I WE'VE BEEN HAVING A LOT OF THE DISCUSSIONS IS WHERE DO WE START FIRST. SO WE NEED TO LOOK AT WHAT WE NEED TO DO. TO OUR COMPENSATE OUR FAMILY CHILDCARE PROVIDERS ON BECAUSE THEY'RE THE LEAST COMPENSATED AT THIS PARTICULAR TIME SO WE'RE LOOKING AT THE PRIORITY SEE THE PRIORITIZATION. FOR THE FUNDING. THEN I YOU ALREADY HEARD THE PRESENTATION AND WE'RE EXPLORING THE TARGET UNIVERSALISM AS A POTENTIAL FRAMEWORK. TO LOOK AT OUR FUTURE WORK. I DEFINITELY LOOKING AT THE GOVERNANCE AND SYSTEMS CHANGE INCLUDING. UP THE REIMBURSEMENT RATES BECAUSE YOU HEARD EVEN FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE I SO WOULD WE LOOK IN THAT. WHAT ABOUT THE COORDINATION OF ANY AND ALL OTHER SYSTEMS? SO WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT. COORDINATION AND COLLABORATION ARE PART OF THE DESIGN THAT ULTIMATELY. OUR ELECTED OFFICIALS WOULD LOOK AT. AND THEN. WE ARE LOOKING AT INTEGRATING APPARENTLY FOR PARENTS AS PART OF OUR RECOMMENDATIONS. BECAUSE PART OF THE EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION. COMES FIRST FROM THE PARENTS THAT'S WHERE IT STARTS. THOUGH I WILL. TURN IT OVER TO. MARY. OKAY. I AM GOING TO BE GIVING YOU JUST A REPORT FROM OUR. EXPANDING ACCESS SUBCOMMITTEE. AND SORT OF I KIND OF ALLUDED TO IT EARLIER WITH OUR CONVERSATION ABOUT TARGET UNIVERSALISM BUT. WE ARE REALLY YOU KNOW I THINK FOR A LONG TIME WHEN WE TALKED ABOUT ACCESS IT'S REALLY BEEN ABOUT WHAT THE UNMET NEED IS. AND TRYING TO MEET THAT NEED. BUT BEYOND. I'VE JUST ACTUAL FUNDING FOR MORE RESOURCES FROM WHICH SERVICES WE DO WANT TO ALSO LOOK AND UNDERSTAND WHAT ARE THE BARRIERS FOR FAMILIES TODAY. WHEN IT COMES TO RACE IMMIGRATION LANGUAGE GEOGRAPHY. BECAUSE YOU KNOW JUST GETTING TO THE DOOR OF THE AGENCY THAT'S GOING TO HELP YOU GET THE ASSISTANCE THAT COULD BE A FULL TIME JOB. AND A LOT OF LAND MINES IN BETWEEN AND SO WE WANT TO REALLY JUST TRY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THOSE ARE. WE WANT TO LOOK AT JUST UNIQUE POPULATIONS. HOME YOU KNOW FAMILIES WHO ARE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS DEEP POVERTY CHILDREN WITH SPECIAL NEEDS. CHILDREN WHO ARE ENGAGED IN THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM AND AGAIN JUST. IN ORDER FOR US TO GET TO UNIVERSAL AS I'M WE WE DO NEED TO RECOGNIZE THAT NOT ALL FAMILIES ARE GOING TO GET THERE. AT THE SAME TIME MORE IN THE SAME PASSED AND SO TO MAKE SURE OUR RECOMMENDATIONS REFLECT THAT. ON ONE OF THE WAYS THAT WE WILL BE DOING THAT IS A SURVEY THAT WERE SET OUT TO THE FIELD. AND PARTICULARLY TO SORT OF SERVICE PROVIDERS AND AND ENTITIES WHO REALLY UNDERSTAND THESE A UNIQUE SPECIAL POPULATIONS TO HELP. US INFORM WHAT RECOMMENDATIONS GO FORWARD. WE'VE DISCUSSED THE POSSIBILITY OF DOING A NEEDS ASSESSMENT AS PART OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS WE SORT OF. YOU KNOW WE HAVE A LOT OF EXPERTS. ON THE COMMISSION BUT. A WE NEED TO KNOW WHAT FAMILIES IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN I NEED AND WHEN THEY NEED CARE HOW THEY NEED CARE. WHAT THEY SEE IS QUALITY AND ALL OF THOSE THINGS? AND WILL BE YOU KNOW DOING A LANDSCAPE ANALYSIS OF OUR ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS. MAKING SURE SYSTEMS ARE SPEAKING TO ONE ANOTHER LOOKING AT THE FACILITY NEEDS. AND REALLY MAKING SURE THAT IN ORDER TO BE TRUE TO OUR MIX DELIVERY SYSTEM THAT WE ARE NOT LEAVING ANYBODY OUT. AND THAT. CENTERS FAMILY CHILD CARE AND FAMILY FRIEND AND NEIGHBOR CARE EACH PLAY A SIGNIFICANT PIECE. TO OUR SYSTEM. AND I THINK WITH THAT EARLY BECAUSE SOONER TO. THAT. SO I'M REPORTING ON THE WORK FORCE RETENTION AND DEVELOPMENT SUBCOMMITTEE THAT COACH SIA ALAN TWENTY MCMILLAN AND THEN ANOTHER MEMBERS ON A COUPLE SVETA. IS THERE IS SOME OF THE PIECES OF RESEARCH THAT WE'VE BEEN LOOKING OUT BUT WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT. MANY NATIONAL SURVEYS AS WELL AS. CALIFORNIA TO GET THAT STATE CONTEXT. SO WE HAVE WE'RE LOOKING AT A RANGE OF TOPICS BUT OVERALL JUST TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE A HIGH QUALITY WORKFORCE THAT'S DIVERSE THAT'S EFFECTIVE. THAT'S WELL COMPENSATED AND PROFESSIONALLY SUPPORTED. AND ONE FOCUS IS OF COURSE BUT COMPENSATION SO WE'RE LOOKING AT COMPENSATION AND REALLY COMPENSATING OUR WORKERS AS THE PROFESSIONALS THAT THEY ARE WHO PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE IN YOUNG CHILDREN'S DEVELOPMENT. WE'RE ALSO LOOKING AT COMPETENCIES SO COMPETENCY BASED. PROFESSIONAL PREPARATION FOR THE WORK FORCE. THIRD WE'RE LOOKING AT INC FOR THEIR LOOKING AT TRAINING AND PREPARATION SO INCREASING PRACTITIONERS KNOWLEDGE IN THE COMPETENCIES THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION PROGRAMS THROUGH CREDENTIALING AND OTHER FORMS OF PROFESSIONAL LEARNING. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS ONGOING PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT THAT IT SUSTAINABLE THAT IT'S CONSISTENT AND COHERENT. AND THAT INCLUDES WORK FAVORABLE WORKING CONDITIONS LIKE PAID RELEASE TIME. AND THEN THE LAST YOU HAVE TO DO WITH. DIVERSITY AND INCLUSIVENESS SO FIRST. DIVERSITY ACROSS SETTINGS SO. INCLUDING FAMILY FRIEND AND NEIGHBOR CARE GIVERS. AND ENSURING THAT WE HAVE A DIVERSE WORKFORCE THAT REALLY REFLECTS THE CHILDREN THAT IT SERVES. AND ALTERNATE OVER TO THE ENGAGING IN MEETING THE NEEDS OF FAMILY. THANK YOU DONE WE NEED FOLLOWING THE FORMAT OF THE OTHER SUBCOMMITTEE PRESENTATIONS WERE PROVIDED A FEW OF THE RESOURCES THAT WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT. AND ONE OF THE ONES THAT THAT. MAY BE THE MOST UNUSUAL IS THE IS THE BOOK ACTUALLY RESEARCH BUT BUT IT'S. VERY VERY WELL DONE ABOUT HERE HOW PARENTS BENEFIT FROM THE ADVICE OF OTHER PARENTS IN THEIR SAME SITUATION. OF AND THAT TOKYO PROGRAMS BRING PARENTS AND PROXIMITY WITH EACH OTHER AND THEY CAN SHARE INFORMATION NOT JUST ABOUT TO OCCUR BUT ABOUT ALL KINDS BUT THE THING SO. THERE'S THERE'S GLAD THAT AND THEN THERE'S MORE. HOW THE INSTITUTIONS SUPPORT AND ENGAGE FAMILIES BUT I THINK THE? THE PIECE I WANNA TELL YOU ABOUT BECAUSE I'M SO EXCITED ABOUT IT I THINK ALL OF US ARE EXCITED ABOUT IT IS THAT WE HAVE A PLAN FOR DOING. FOCUS GROUPS WITH PARENTS IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE STATE SO THAT WE'RE GONNA GET TO COLLECT QUALITATIVE DATA FROM PARENTS IN A WHOLE VARIETY OF PLACES USING A WHOLE GREAT PROGRAMS. AND WITH A VARIETY OF EXPERIENCES SAID THAT THEY CAN TELL US HOW THIS LOOKS TO THEM FROM THEIR OWN EXPERIENCES BOTH WHAT HAVE BEEN THE SUCCESSES AND THE PAINT AND THE BENEFITS BUT ALSO THE. CHALLENGES OF NEGOTIATING EXTREMELY COMPLICATED SYSTEM. AND SO WE'RE EXPECTING THAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE RESULTS MAY MEAN AT THE FINAL REPORT OF RESULTS BUT SOME RESULTS FROM OUR. AYE IN THE FALL. WHICH IS WONDERFUL BECAUSE IT CAN IS AS YOU'VE BEEN HEARING IT WILL INFORM I THINK RECOMMENDATIONS THROUGHOUT THE REPORT. TED TO ACTUALLY HEAR HOW PEOPLE USE OUR EXISTING CHILD CARE SYSTEM AND WHERE THEY SEE. OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES AND ALSO. HELPING TO IDENTIFY WHERE THEY GET THEIR INFORMATION. BECAUSE IT IS A REALLY COMPLEX SYSTEM OVER SYSTEMS ARE WAY TOO. COMPLICATED PROBABLY FOR FOR FAMILIES WHO ARE FACING MULTIPLE CHALLENGES WITH YOUNG CHILDREN BUT IT IS DIFFICULT TO NEGOTIATE SOME WERE ALSO LOOKING AT. WHAT IN THE RULES OF INFORMAL COMMUNITY BASED GROUPS CAN PLAY IN TERMS OF HELPING PARENTS GET CONNECTED AND UNDERSTANDING WHERE RESOURCES AND INFORMATION THAT SO? IT'S IT'S SO. AS I SAY WE'RE ALL VERY EXCITED ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO HEAR FROM MANY PARENTS STAND AND NOT JUST FROM A COUPLE IN THIS FORM OUT. BUT THAT WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO DEVELOP FORUMS THAT ARE REALLY DESIGNED TO. GET GET THE BEST INFORMATION WE CAN FROM THE PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY KNOW THIS SYSTEM RIGHT NOW. BETTER THAN ANYONE ELSE. OKAY THANK YOU. THEY HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FOR ANY OTHER. COMMITTEE REPORTS. TING SAYING NONE. WE'LL PROCEED NOW WITH PUBLIC COMMENT. IF ANYBODY IS HERE TO. TALK TO US. SHARE YOUR IDEAS. GET AFTERNOON I'M TRACY PATTERSON WITH CALIFORNIA FOOD POLICY ADVOCATES AND I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BRING UP SOMETHING THAT HASN'T BEEN DISCUSSED WHEN IT COMES TO FINANCING CHILD CARE. AND THAT IS FOOD. FOOD IS CENTRAL TO CARING FOR CHILDREN I CAN TELL YOU FIRST HAND AS A FORMER HEAD START TEACHER AND PARENT YOUNG CHILDREN FOOD IS NOT OPTIONAL WHEN IT COMES TO TAKING CARE OF KIDS DURING THE DAY. BUT AT THE SAME TIME IT'S SOMETHING THAT KEEPS BEING SEEN AS A NICE TO HAVE EXTRA IN THE STATE BUDGET AS OPPOSED TO SOMETHING THAT IS COR TO THE BUSINESS OF TAKING CARE OF KIDS. DURING THE DAY WHILE THEIR PARENTS ARE AT WORK AND SO I REALLY WANT TO EMPHASIZE TO THE COMMITTEE JUST HOW IMPORTANT IT IS THAT WE HAVE AN ADEQUATELY FUNDED CHILD CARE FOOD PROGRAM IN CALIFORNIA. SINCE WE CUT STATE FUNDING DURING DURING THE RECESSION WE HAVE NOT GOTTEN IT BACK AND CHILD POVERTY RATES AT THIS POINT ARE STILL HIGHER THAN THEY WERE IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN BEFORE THE RECESSION FAMILIES HAVEN'T RECOVERED WHILE THE STATE ECONOMY HOUSE. AND SO IT'S REALLY CRITICAL THAT WE RESTORE THE STATE'S SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING TO THE CHILD CARE FOOD PROGRAM BECAUSE A CHILD CARE PROVIDERS DON'T HAVE THAT PROGRAM THEY JUST PULL FROM OTHER PARTS OF THE FUNDING THEY'RE PULLING FROM THEIR PROVIDER RATES. BECAUSE FOOD IS AN OPTIONAL WHEN THEY DON'T HAVE THE PROGRAM THEY MAKE IT WORK REGARDLESS SIR REALLY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IS BEING THOUGHT OF AS PART OF THE FULL PICTURE. BOTH THE BUSINESS MODEL OF CHILD CARE AND WHAT CHILDREN NEED DURING THE DAY. THANK YOU. HELLO MY NAME IS MARY JANE MCGUIRE FONG AND I'M HERE REPRESENTING. PEACH WHICH ANOTHER ADVOCACY GROUP. LOOKING AT INTEGRATING THE HIGHER EDUCATION COMMUNITY IN SUPPORT OF QUALITY PROGRAM EARLY CHILDHOOD PROGRAMS. I WHAT I WANT TO SPEAK. SOMEWHAT BROADLY TO WHAT WE HEARD TODAY WHAT AN INCREDIBLE HEARING. HOPE IT IS LISTEN TO WIDELY ACROSS THE STRAITS THE STATE ON THE STREAMING SERVICE. I WANT TO BEGIN BY SAYING THANK YOU FOR INCLUDING THE ASHAR PARA BELIEF IN THE DISCUSSION BECAUSE IF WE CAN INCLUDE. A PARENTAL LEAVE AS WE TALK ABOUT THE EARLY CHILDHOOD QUALITY. WORKFORCE COMPENSATION DILEMMA ETCETERA. WE'RE GOING TO TACKLE SOME OF THE FINANCING QUESTIONS. THE QUESTION THAT I ALWAYS WORK WITH IS. WHEN WHEN WE'RE THINKING ABOUT THE FULL RANGE OF SERVICES THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT BIRTH TO FIVE HERE. THE QUESTION THAT I ALWAYS THINK ABOUT IS WHAT DO BABIES ASK ABOUT US AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE RESEARCH AND I UNDERSTAND ROSS THOMPSON FROM UC DAVIS WAS WITH YOU A COUPLE OF TIMES BEFORE. A LOOKING AT THE AMAZING COMPETENCE A BABY'S TO LEARN WE CAN'T THEY ASK OF US THE SAME THING THAT THREE AND FOUR AND FIVE YEAR OLDS ASK OF US. THEY ASK ONE THING ARE YOU THERE FOR ME TO SUPPORT MY INCREDIBLE AMAZING CAPACITY TO LEARN. THEY WOULD LIKE TO BE CLOSE TO FAMILIARS. SO THAT'S HOW WE GET INTO THIS COMPLEX QUESTION OF WHO ARE THOSE FAMILIAR IS TO THE BABY INTO THE FAMILY. SO WE HAVE TO BE BE PRESENT TO THE QUESTIONS THAT YOU ASK ABOUT THE FAMILY CHILDCARE PROVIDERS WITHIN OUR SYSTEM AND THE PEOPLE WHO WERE NEXT DOOR TO THE FAMILY SO THAT THEY HAVE ACCESS. THESE ARE COMPLEX QUESTIONS IT FROM THE PERSPECTIVE THE BIGGER PERSON ACTIVE THAT WOULD THAT. LYNN COROLLA BEGAN WITH. HOW DO WE THINK ABOUT THE WORK FOREST'S? AND THE ISSUE OF OF A BACCALAUREATE DEGREE IS FOR THOSE PEOPLE PREPARING THIS WORK TO DO THIS WORK WE CAN GET THERE. IF WE KEEP ALL THESE QUESTIONS IN THE MIX WHICH IS WHAT YOU ARE DOING. PEACH AND OTHER HIGHER EDUCATION GROUPS HAVE BEEN WORKING TIRELESSLY IN CALIFORNIA. A FIGURE OUT THE QUESTION OF WORKFORCE PREPARATION FOR EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION IT'S REALLY COMPLICATED THE ANSWERS ARE NOT CLEAR YET. YET ONE ISSUE IS CLEAR WE NEED RIGOR. WE NEED DRAPER WE CAN GIVE WE CAN GIVE ON RAKER AND WHETHER A. SOMEBODY IS A TEACHER OR A FAMILY CHILDCARE PROVIDER SERVING INFANTS AND TODDLERS. THEY NEED TO BE PAID WELL BUT THEY ALSO NEED TO BE PREPARED WELL AND SO LOOKING AT WAYS TO DO A SYSTEM THAT IS. GONNA BE COMPLEX IN SAN FRANCISCO MY GOD YOU'RE REALLY HIT LEADING THE WAY ON. A TACKLING COMPLEX QUESTION BUT I HONESTLY BELIEVE WE CAN GET THERE. IN THE NAME OF OF QUALITY CARE SO THANK YOU THANK YOU. YEAH AND JUST I DIDN'T SAID EARLIER BUT YOU CAN TRY TO TRY TO KEEP IT TO THE MANOR TO. IS NOT A HUGE LINE SOMEWHAT SIMPLE BE A LITTLE BIT CHEN. THANK YOU. HELLO MY NAME IS CHARLOTTE NAIL IN A MUCH ERICA CHILDCARE PROVIDERS SUBCOMMITTEE COUNTY. AND ALSO A UNION MEMBER OF UT WCC P. YOU ALL WHILE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING WHAT'S NOT DISCUSSED IN TODAY'S HEARING I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE THE TIME TO SING CHILDCARE PROVIDERS ACROSS THE STATE NEED THE RIGHT TO COLLECTIVE BARGAINING. SO WE CAN BETTER MEET THE NEEDS OF THE CHILDREN WE CARE FOR IN THEIR FAMILIES. WHAT THE HELL IN THE RIGHT COLLECTIVE BARGAINING WE CAN WORK TOGETHER AS A FAMILY CHILDCARE ADVOCATE TO IMPROVE ACCESS TO HIGH QUALITY AND AFFORDABLE CHILDCARE FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS WE NEED? EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION RECOGNIZED IMPORTANT WORK IT IS COLLECTIVE BARGAINING WILL GIVE US A SEAT AT THE TABLE SO WE CAN BETTER ADVOCATE FOR OURSELVES AND FOR OUR FAMILIES THANK YOU. THANK YOU.
