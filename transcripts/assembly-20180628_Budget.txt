WE'RE GONNA BE STARTING WITH S. B. EIGHT FIVE SEVEN IN HOME SUPPORT SERVICES. DISCUSSED. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN STERN VICE CHAIR MEMBERS ANY COST WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THIS BILL WHICH APPLIES ONLY TO LOS ANGELES ORANGE MERCED COUNTIES REQUIRES THE COUNTY OR PUBLIC AUTHORITY IN A RECOGNIZED EMPLOYEE ORGANIZATION. UPON REQUEST OF EITHER PARTY TO MEET AND CONFER REGARDING THE STRUCTURE TIME AND MANNER OF THE ACCESS OF THE EXCLUSIVE REPRESENTATIVE TO AYE H. AS FAST. PROVIDER ORIENTATIONS. THIS MAY INCLUDE FOR PROVISION OF THE BILL IS AYE BECOMES AN OPERATIVE ON JULY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE BILL ALSO APPROPRIATES TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS GENERAL FUND TO THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES TO IMPLEMENT THE PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL. WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. I'M BACK TO THE COMMITTEE MISTER. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR SO. I UNDERSTAND THE BILL ALLOWS THE REPRESENTATION ORGANIZATION -- ACCESS TO THE ORIENTATION -- IS THAT THE ONLY ORGANIZATION I WOULD BE ABLE TO PRESENT IN OTHER WORDS IF THERE WAS AN ORGANIZATION THAT WATER TO MAKE A PRESENTATION ON THE ORIENTATION -- THAT. CONVINCED EMPLOYEES THAT BELONGING TO THE REPRESENTATIVE ORGAN ORGANIZATION WAS NOT THEIR BEST INTEREST WITH HAPPY ALLOWED. IT'S SILENT ON THAT AND PARTICULAR QUESTION BUT I WOULD RECALL THAT THERE WAS ANOTHER TRAILER BILL HEARD BY THIS COMMITTEE SEVERAL WEEKS AGO THAT HAS MOVEMENT MANY MORE BROAD PROVISIONS REQUIRE BURKE REGARDING THIS PARTICULAR PROCESS -- BILL BEFORE YOU THE SILENT ON THAT. I RECALL THE TRAILER BILL ALSO. PROVISIONS OF THAT TRAILER BILL WAS THAT NO ORGANIZATIONS LOUD ADVOCATE -- THROUGH IN A GOVERNMENTAL SETTING AGAINST BELONGING. TO THE THE UNION SO I JUST THINK IT'S FAIR THAT IF. THE UNION SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO THE ORIENTATION THAT OTHER ORGANIZATION SHOULD AS WELL -- IT SO THAT THAT'S ARE ONE OF THE REASONS OF A BIG PROBLEM WITH THIS TRAILER BILL BUT THANK YOU FOR ANSWERING THE QUESTION OTHER COMMENTS. BUT TO TRY. THE READING OF THE ANALYSIS S. B. R. -- EIGHT FIVE SEVEN IS -- CLEARLY ATTEMPTING A TO ORGANIZE AYE H. ASSESS EMPLOYEES ARE ULTIMATELY. TO BE UNIONIZED. WAS SO ADVANTAGE OF OUR UNIONIZING -- SUCH. OUR I ITCH ASSESS OUR EMPLOYEES ARE IF THEY DO. YOU KNOW WHAT THEY ARE THE PEOPLE PROVIDING. AREA VULNERABLE A POPULATION AND THAT IF THE ARE ARE ORGANIZED TO AND EVENTUALLY COME. TO A THE POINT THAT -- LABOR NEGOTIATIONS. STONE AGREED YEAH. ALTON BECAUSE OF THE MATTERS ARE AND THAT THEY CHOOSE TO STRIKE THAT THEN -- THE CONSEQUENCES ARE OF THAT THE NO STRIKE. WHEN NO WILCO WERE CHAU WHAT BUT? TO TAKE CARE OF THE ARE. ARE ELDERLY. AND A WHO ARE IN OUR VERY. SYRIA IS -- CONDITION IN THE VEIN NEED. EVERY MINUTE DOT HOW WELL DONE WHAT WOULD BE THE BENEFITS THAT FOR THE UP PUBLIC. BECAUSE OF THIS BILL IS SO CLEARLY. YEAH JAKE POOR WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE -- SO. I I JUST AS PROVIDERS ALREADY I AM ARE -- GENERALLY REPRESENTED BY -- UNIONS IN THAT IN THE STATE -- SIMILAR -- TO OTHER -- YEAH YOU KNOW -- UNION REPRESENTED EMPLOYEES STATE THEY ARE PAY A FAIR SHARE -- TO BE REPRESENTED SOAKED COLLECTIVE BARGAINING DOES HAPPEN NOW CURRENTLY BETWEEN -- COUNTIES OR PUBLIC AUTHORITIES -- AND THE UNIONS. SO THIS ISN'T THE END AND THERE IS ALREADY A PROVISION IN. AND LAW THAT -- I BUT YOU KNOW ALLOWS UNIONS TO MAKE A PRESENTATION DURING THESE ORIENTATION. I CAN SEE THE DIFFERENCE JOB RIGHT THE OF BEING REPRESENTED. BY UNION GROUP WAS OF THE OTHER GROUP OUT ON BEHALF OF DISA. OUT WORKERS OF OUR AYE IT'S A SATISFIED THAT'S ONE THING. BUT ORGANIZING THEMSELVES. AND NOT EXERCISING DEAL RIGHTS THAT'S SO TWO DIFFERENT MATTER. OKAY ANY OTHER COMMENTS QUESTIONS. WE HAVE OUR PUBLIC COMMENT IN FAVOR OF S. B.. EIGHT FIVE SEVEN ANY PUBLIC COMMENT OPPOSE. COMING IN FAVOR. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER MY NAME IS CHRISTINE ABBAS HAMILTON I'M HERE REPRESENTING YOU W.. PATHS ME LOCAL THIRTY NINE THIRTY WE REPRESENT OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND OF OF THE IHS AS PROVIDERS. AND TO ANSWER THE ASSEMBLYMEMBERS QUESTION OF ALL OF OUR CONTRACTS. INCLUDE NO STRIKE PROVISIONS BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF THE WORK THAT OUR MEMBERS DO -- WE WOULD NEVER ASK THEM TO GO OUT ON STRIKE INTO NOT -- PROVIDE SERVICES TO THE VULNERABLE OF FOLKS THAT THE WORK FORCE SO THE THIS IS DEFINITELY A DIFFERENT TYPE. OF OUR COLLECTIVE BARGAINING STRUCTURE I JUSTICE IS PRETTY COMPLICATED -- WE HAVE AN EMPLOYER ALREADY -- WE THE STAY AT TIMES IS CONSIDERED A JOINT EMPLOYER DEPENDS ON WHAT THE ISSUE IS THE THE LAWS ACTUALLY PRETTY COMPLICATED ON THAT BUT I CAN SPEAK TO THE STRIKE PROVISION VERY CLEARLY -- WE'RE WE UP -- SUPPORT THE BILL -- VERY MUCH BECAUSE WE REPRESENT WORKERS IN ORANGE AND IN MERCED COUNTY AND WE VERY MUCH ARE SEEKING THE CLARITY THAT THE BILL PROVIDES WHICH IS THAT WE HAVE THE RIGHT. TO MEET AND CONFER WITH THE EMPLOYER OVER THE STRUCTURE TIENEN MANNER OF PROVIDER ORIENTATIONS THOSE ISSUES OUR CAUSING TREMENDOUS CONFLICT FOR US. IN THE COUNTIES WE BELIEVE THE BILL WILL GIVE US THE CLARITY THAT WE NEED AT A AS TO WHAT OUR RIGHTS ARE. TO BE CLEAR THIS RIGHT ALREADY EXISTS FOR EVERY OTHER PUBLIC WORKER IN CALIFORNIA THIS IS A QUESTION OF PARITY FOR US -- YOU WILL HEAR FROM THE FOLKS WHO GET UP IN OPPOSITION THAT THEY OPPOSE THE BILL BECAUSE IT'S NOT WORKABLE IN ITS CURRENT FORM. THEY'RE GOING TO USE A LOT OF SEMANTICS. THAT THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A COUNTY IN A PUBLIC AUTHORITY -- FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT HAVE SERVED ON THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS I'M NOT SURE HOW MANY THERE ARE ON THIS COMMITTEE. ANYONE WHO KNOWS. I JUST US AND LIFE IN THE COUNTIES KNOWS THAT COUNTIES ABSOLUTELY CONTROL PUBLIC AUTHORITIES. THERE IS NO CONTRACT THAT THE UNION CAN NEGOTIATE THAT IS NOT SIGNED OFF ON LITERALLY BY A VOTE OF THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. SO ANY NOTION THAT THE PUBLIC AUTHORITY IS GOING TO NEGOTIATE SOMETHING THAT THE CONTRACT OF THE COUNTY DISAGREES WITH. IS GIBBERISH AND THE SMOKE SCREEN TO CREATE OPPOSITION OVER SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T EXIST WHAT THEY REALLY ARE OPPOSE TO FROM THE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE IS LOSS OF CONTROL. OVER UNILATERALLY IMPLEMENTING HOW THEY WANT THINGS TO GO IN PROVIDER ORIENTATION SO TO BE CLEAR THAT'S REALLY WHAT THE PROBLEM IS. IT'S NOT A QUESTION OF A WHO IS TECHNICALLY THE EMPLOYER THE COUNTY IS THE ONE WHO. A CONTROLS ORIENTATIONS AND A PUBLIC AUTHORITIES DON'T AGAIN THAT'S NOT TRUE IN EVERY COUNTY AND OF PUBLIC AUTHORITIES FUNCTION -- AS A ENTITY SIMPLY TO SERVICE THE EMPLOYER OF RECORD WE ALL KNOW THAT THE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS ABSOLUTELY CONTROLS. EVERYTHING RELATING TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF IHS US WORKERS SO TO BE CLEAR THAT'S WHAT YOU'LL HEAR -- VERY HAPPY TO TALK THROUGH THE TECHNICAL ASPECTS OF THAT WITH CLARIFYING QUESTIONS SO. ON STE BEHALF OF OUR WORKERS AND OUR MEMBERS WE VERY MUCH ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT FOR THIS VERY IMPORTANT BILL THANK YOU. THE CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE BRIAN NELSON THEM HALF OF THE AMERICAN FEDERATION OF STATE COUNTY MUNICIPAL EMPLOYEES -- FOR THE REASONS PREVIOUSLY STATED WHEN A STRONG SUPPORTER OF SADDAM FOR PIECE OF LEGISLATION I BELIEVE THAT IT'S IMPORTANT CLARIFYING. ODD I CHANGED TO THE EXISTING SET -- MISSPENT HAMILTON STATED -- I BELIEVE THAT IS ABSOLUTELY PRUDENT AT THIS TIME -- TO INSURE THAT THERE'S GREATER CLARITY AS WELL AS BALANCE IN TERMS OF HOW WE SETTLE THESE ISSUES AT THE TABLE SO. WITH ALL DUE RESPECT REQUEST OVERS RIVERS WOULD WORK RESPECTFULLY REQUEST NOT BUILT THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MIKE WE OWE THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION ON ASSOCIATE MY COMICS THOSE OF MY COLLEAGUES FROM A UW AND ASKED ME A WE AGREE THAT. INCREASING ACCESS AND COMMUNICATION BETWEEN -- I'D JUST AS PROVIDERS AND THEIR EXCLUSIVE EMPLOYEE REPRESENTATIVE WILL ENSURE THAT THOSE WORKERS WHO ARE USUALLY AND ISOLATED SITUATIONS WHERE THEY WORK ALONE. I DON'T SHOULD THOSE WORKERS HAVE -- FULL% ACCESS TO THE INFORMATION THE RESOURCES AND THE TOOLS NEEDED TO BETTER SERVE THEIR CLIENTS IN MATTERS OF THE PUBLIC SO FOR THOSE REASONS RESTAURANTS SUPPORT. THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU SEEING NO OTHER PUBLIC COMMENT IN SUPPORT ANY PUBLIC COMMENT IN OPPOSITION. I AYE JUSTIN GARRETT CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES US SINCE MY TESTIMONY WAS ALREADY PREVIEWED I'LL TRY TO KEEP IT SHORT -- AS AS WAS INDICATED THERE IS A COMPLEX EMPLOYMENT STRUCTURE FOR RIGHTS THAT'S THERE ARE SPECIFIC -- DUTIES THAT COUNTIES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR WHICH INCLUDE IMPLEMENTING PROVIDE ORIENTATIONS. THERE ARE SPECIFIC DUTIES THAT PUBLIC AUTHORITIES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR WHICH INCLUDE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING -- ANIMOSITY CAN ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF PUBLIC AUTHORITIES. SO ESSENTIALLY THAT THE CHANGES THAT WHAT THIS BILL DOES DIFFERENTLY IS IT WOULD MANDATE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING BY PUBLIC AUTHORITIES OVER SOMETHING THAT THE COUNTIES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR IMPLEMENTING WHICH IS THE PROVIDE ORIENTATIONS. IT WOULD ALSO INTRODUCE THE POSSIBILITY OF BINDING ARBITRATION TO OCCUR I'M WHERE CONDITIONS COULD BE OPPOSED ON COUNTIES THAT THEY WEREN'T A PARTY TO THE BARGAINING OF THAT THEY WOULD POTENTIALLY OBJECTS HILL AND THAT IS ANOTHER DISTINCTION AND HOW THIS BILL IS DIFFERENT I'M WE WERE NOT CONSULTED ON THIS. LANGUAGE OR THESE CONCERNS ABOUT PROVIDE ORIENTATIONS PRIOR TO THE BILL GOING INTO PRINT AND SO WE HAVE WORK -- TO WORK WITH THAT THE SPONSORS AND AND TRY TO FIGURE OUT ALTERNATIVE APPROACH WE PROVIDED SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS TO PROVIDE AN ALTERNATIVE APPROACH. I AM IN ORDER FOR THE PROVIDER UNIONS AND THE COUNTIES TO REACH AGREEMENT ON I'M PROVIDING UNION PARTICIPATION UMAP RIGHT OR NO. THOSE MOMENTS WHEN THEN I MIGHT ALSO NOTE THAT THE THREE I COUNTIES THAT. ARE DOES NEED IN THIS BILL THEY ALL COMPLY WITH STATE LAW RELATED TO PROVIDE A UNION ACCESS THAT PROVIDE ORIENTATIONS AND I'M AWARE OF SPECIFIC EXAMPLES OF THEM. I'M WORKING WITH PROVIDING UNIONS AND AGREEING TO THINGS THAT ARE BEYOND STATE LAW IN TERMS OF THE THE PROVIDE YOU NAME GETTING TO SPEAK FIRST. OR I'M OTHER GROUPS NOT BEING ABLE TO PUT A SPIN OFFS RIGHT ORIENTATION SO FOR ALL OF THOSE REASONS -- WE REMAIN OPPOSED THIS BILL THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. SEARCH OUR MEMBERS TO MEN OF OURS UPON THE URBAN KINDS OF CALIFORNIA ALSO IN OPPOSITION ONE ALLY MY COMMENTS WITH SIX ACTED Q.. THANK YOU NEED ADDITIONAL. COMMENTS IN OPPOSITION OKAY -- WE WILL BE MOVING ON TO A. B. EIGHTEEN THIRTY EIGHT JUST OR JUST TO MAKE A NOTE I A. B. EIGHTEEN THIRTY EIGHT AND S. B. EIGHT SEVEN TWO WERE IDENTICAL WE WERE. WE ARE GONNA BE SHOWING BOTH OF THEM ARE THERE WAS A TECHNICAL AMENDMENT [inaudible] TO AB S. B. EIGHT SEVEN TWO TO HAVE A REGARDING A TECHNICAL ISSUE REGARDING CANNABIS. SO WE ARE GOING TO HEAR BOTH BILLS ONE THE ORIGINAL BILL AND THEN ONE WHICH IS THE BILL WITH THE TECHNICAL AMENDMENT SO YOU CAN -- FEEL FREE TO DISCUSS BOTH OF THEM TOGETHER AS AT AB EIGHTEEN THIRTY EIGHT NEXT BE EIGHT SEVEN TWO MISS COST. THANK YOU FOR AB EIGHTEEN THIRTY EIGHT THIS BILL WOULD PROHIBIT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FROM IMPOSING OR INCREASING ANY TAXES OR FEES ON GROCERIES WHICH DO NOT A INCLUDE ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES CAO. PRODUCTS WERE CIGARETTES UNLESS BOTH OF THE FOLLOWING CONDITIONS ARE MET. THE TAXES GENERALLY APPLICABLE TO A BROAD RANGE OF BUSINESSES BUSINESS ACTIVITY OUR PRODUCTS AND THE TAX DOES NOT IMPOSE A HIGHER TAX RATE ON ANY PARTICULAR CLASSIFICATION OF GROCERIES THE BILL ALSO INCLUDES A DEFINITION OF GROCERIES. THE BILL GRANDFATHERS IN TAXES ON GROCERIES THAT WERE PASSED BEFORE JULY FIRST TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND SUNSETS AND IS REPEALED ON JANUARY FIRST -- TWENTY THIRTY ONE WE'D KNOW THAT ALTHOUGH THIS IS AN ADMINISTRATION PROPOSAL AND NORMALLY WE WOULD NOT SUPPORT A MEASURE THAT LIMITS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS REVENUE GENERATING AUTHORITY. ON WE ARE AND CONCERNED ABOUT SOME OF THE PROVISIONS IMPACTS ON OF THE INITIATIVE ON THAT ARE ALIGNED WITH THIS PARTICULAR BILL ON STATE SPECIAL FUNDS. AND I IN LIGHT OF THAT AS PASSAGE OF THIS BILL A RESULTS IN THAT PARTICULAR INITIATIVE BEING PULLED THE ADMINISTRATION WILL SUPPORT. I'M I WOULD KNOW THAT ON IN THE LA OWES INITIATIVE -- FISCAL ANALYSIS THE NOTES THAT THE INNOCENT INITIATIVES PASSAGE WOULD BE AND WOULD HAVE SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND ALTHOUGH. IN THEIR ANALYSIS THEY SAY THE IMPACT TO THE STATE IS MINOR. I THINK ON BASED ON THE ALICE PREVIOUS TESTIMONY IN THE SENATE THERE REALLY REVIEWING THAT IN THE CONTEXT OF THE ENTIRETY OF THE STATE BUDGET WHICH I HAVE RIGHT NOW ON BASED ON HOW THE BUDGET THAT WAS SIGNED YESTERDAY BY THE GOVERNOR'S AROUND TWO HUNDRED AND ONE POINT FOUR BILLION. DOLLARS. I WOULD OFFER TO TO THE COMMITTEE ANOTHER WAY TO VIEW IT THOUGH IS THROUGH THE PRISM OF PROGRAMS. AND I IF YOU LOOK AT NATURAL RESOURCES AND THE ENVIRONMENT ON THE PROVISIONS OF THE INITIATIVE ON THOSE PARTICULAR SPECIAL FUNDS WOULD BE DEVASTATING BECAUSE MANY OF OUR PROGRAMS UTILIZE THOSE FUNDS -- FOR THEIR IMPLEMENTATION AND FOR MANY DIFFERENT PROGRAMS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. US WITHOUT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS I WOULD NOTE I'M AS THE CHAIR NOTED US THE OTHER MEASURE S. B.. EIGHT SEVENTY TWO A CONTAINS A CLARIFYING PROVISION ON THE DEFINITION OF CANNABIS ON THAT WAS AN ISSUE THAT I UNDERSTAND THROUGH COMMITTEE STAFF WAS RAISED BY SEVERAL -- LOCALITIES LEDGES AND ENSURES THAT THE DEFINITION IS ITS BROADER BASED ON DIFFERENT CODE SECTIONS THAT DEFINE CANNABIS. THANK YOU MISS COST AND WE ANTICIPATE GETTING -- AB EIGHT EIGHTEEN THIRTY EIGHT FROM THE SENATE AND VOTING IT ON THE FLOOR TODAY. BUT WE WILL NOT BE TAKING UP S. B. EIGHT SEVEN TWO INTEL MONDAY. ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE MISTER STONE BOB. THANK YOU I AM I READING THROUGH THIS AND I KNOW THIS WAS THE DEAL THAT WAS STRUCK AND I MEASURE IN QUESTION WOULD BE DEVASTATING TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. BUT I WONDER WHAT WE'RE DOING TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HERE. AS WELL ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO ARE TRYING TO CREATE SALES OR TAXES ON SUGAR SWEETENED BEVERAGES AND AND OTHERS ESPECIALLY GIVING THAT. THE SAUDIS THAT'S THAT'S SORT OF OUR POLITICAL DILEMMA. I HAVE A STRUCTURAL PROBLEM THOUGH WITH THIS BILL AS A THAT BADLY BURNED UNIFORM SALES LOCAL SALES AND USE TAX WAS SET UP. SO THAT LOCAL JURISDICTIONS DON'T HAVE TO CLICK TAXES THE STATE THEN DOES THAT AND DISPERSES TO THEM. AND SO IF A LOCAL JURISDICTION ATTEMPTS TO DO SOMETHING SPECIFICALLY RELATED TO A SODA TAX WHICH IS REALLY WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WE WE DON'T ALLOW SALES TAX ON GROCERIES OR OTHER ITEMS ANYWAY. SO IT. SEEMS THAT WE WOULDN'T WANT I WOULDN'T EXPECT A LOCAL JURISDICTION TO TRY AND TAX. OTHER GROCERIES BUT THEY ARE TRYING TO GO AFTER SODAS. BUT IF THEY DO OR IF THEY DO SOMETHING THAT OFFENDS THIS STATUTE. THEN WE ARE BY THIS BY THIS BILL THEN ORDERING. THE CALIFORNIA HARMONY TAX AND FEE ADMINISTRATION TO CANCEL THEIR CONTRACT FOR ALL OTHER COLLECTION AND AND SPUR SPENT OF TAXES. SO THEY OFFENDERS IN ONE LITTLE AREA. AND WE HIT THEM WITH A VERY VERY VERY LARGE HAMMER AND LEAVE ALL THE LOCAL TAXES COLLECTION AND DISBURSEMENT AT ALL THAT AND ALL THE OTHER BENEFITS. OF THE BRADLEY BURNS UNIFORM. LOCAL SALES AND USE TAX LAW WE JUST STRIP THAT AWAY FROM THEM -- WHO REALLY STRUGGLING WITH THE DRACONIAN NATURE OF THAT AS A PENALTY? CAN YOU TELL WHY THIS IS THE WAY IT S.. I CAN'T REALLY SPEAK TO THE RATIONALE YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THAT THERE IS A PROVISION IN THE BILL THAT WOULD AND BASICALLY DIRECT THAT DEPARTMENT OF TAX ANTI ADMINISTRATION TO CANCEL THEIR CONTRACT WITH LOCALS FOR TAX COLLECTION. ON AS A STATED PREVIOUSLY THIS IS NOT AN ADMINISTRATION PROPOSAL SO I CAN'T SPEAK TO THE RATIONALE BEHIND THIS PARTICULAR PROVISION. AND I HAVE A QUESTION THE CONSTITUTIONALITY THAT ESPECIALLY SINCE WE HAVE NEVER CHARTER CITIES AND OTHERS WHO HAVE SPECIFIC CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY TO DO THINGS IN THE STATE. HAS WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO A LOT WITH RESPECT TO TAXES BUT TO CONFER A BENEFIT AND THEN TAKE BACK. A BENEFIT ESPECIALLY WHEN DUH. PUNISHMENT SEEMS TO FAR OUTWEIGH THE POTENTIAL CRIME HERE I'D JUST. I THINK THIS SETS A VERY BAD PRECEDENT THAT. I CAN'T REALLY ANSWER THAT QUESTION THANK YOU [inaudible] MR CARTER. AND YEAH I THINK I GOT CLARIFICATION OF UP HERE BUT JUST WANT TO CONFIRM THAT THAT JURISDICTION'S THAT. NEED TO REAUTHORIZE. I THINK THERE'S ONLY ONE OF THE CITIES WOULD BE ABLE TO DO SO AS FAR AS A NEW SORT OF TAX CORRECT. NO YEAH THE IT ANY ARM. IN THE TAX WAS IN PLACE PRIOR TO JANUARY ONE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WOULD CONTINUE TO BE -- WHO EXIST AND COULD BE REAUTHORIZED JUSTICE COULD BE INCREASED OR COULD HAVE HAVE A NEW TAX CORRECT BUT IT COULD I THINK OF ONE OF THE CITIES? RICHMOND BERKELEY. AS A SUNSET AND THEY COULD REAUTHORIZE CORRECT. YES THE PROVISION STATES LOCAL AGENCY MAY CONTINUE ELEVEN O'CLOCK ENFORCER REVIEW AUTHORIZE ANY TAX FEE OR OTHER SETUP ON GROCERIES IMPOSED EXTENDED OR INCREASED. ON OR BEFORE JANUARY FIRST TWENTY EIGHTEEN SO TO THE DEGREE LOCALITY HOT IN THE EXISTING TAX IN THIS AREA ON IF THERE WAS A SENSE THAT THEY COULD EXTEND -- PUT A VOTER ABSOLUTELY DISAGREE WITH THAT I THINK IS VERY VERY CLEAR BY THE WAY THE LANGUAGE IS TO JUST LET READ THAT THEY WOULD HAVE. TO THEY WOULD HAVE TO EXTEND IT PRIOR TO THAT DATE. THAT EXTENSION DONE AFTER THAT DATE WOULD NOT BE ALLOWED INTO THIS TO THIS THAT YOU YEAH. THAT MISTER CHAIR. COULD WE HAVE SOME CLARIFICATION ON MISTER STONE'S QUESTION. I RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE AS I READ THAT SECTION AND BASICALLY GRANDFATHERS AND THE LOCALITIES THE HOTLINE IN EXISTENCE PRIOR AND ALLOWS THEM TO REAUTHORIZE. YOU THINK TO MY COLLEAGUES -- PLANES REAUTHORIZE WOULD NOT INCLUDE INCREASING THAT -- BUT IF THEY HIDE SOMETHING IN EXISTENCE THE HOW TO SUNSET THEY WOULD BE ALLOWED TO REAUTHORIZE SO LONG I'VE. IT EXISTED PRIOR TO THE DATE SPECIFIED. AND THEN THE BIG PICTURE AS AYE I THINK THIS IS A TERRIBLE DECISION THAT WORK WERE MAKING. VERY DISTURBED BY IT FIRST OF ALL THE POLITICS HOW IT CAME ABOUT BRIDGES. THE POWER PLAY AND BEING FORCED IN THE CORNER AND IN OUR CITY HERE. WE HAVE THE CITY COUNCIL THAT'S DEBATING DOING A SUGAR SWEETENED BEVERAGE POLICY TO ADDRESS THE OBESITY EPIDEMIC BRING MORE P. AND HEALTH PROGRAMS TO UNDERSERVED AREAS. AT THE SAME TIME WE HAVE A SALES pUP NEXT YEAR TO ACTUALLY PUT ON THE BALLOT NOW IS THAT FROM THE COUNCIL. TWENTY TWELVE THAT WOULD MEAN IF IT DIDN'T PASS IT TO GET TWO THIRDS VOTE THAT'S FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN CUTS. TO PARKS RECREATION POLICE AND FIRE SERVICE SO. BUT THE CHOICES THAT WE HAVE HERE ARE ARE BOTH THAT NOT GOOD ONES AND WE HAVE TO EVALUATE THAT BUT JUST. I WANT TO EXPRESS MY MY GREAT DISPLEASURE IN THIS WHOLE THAT PROCESS IN THIS BILL BEFORE US. I THINK IT WAS FROM. I JUST REAL QUICK CAN YOU OUTLINE HOW OLD THIS MORATORIUM OR DEAL IS ENFORCED. IF YOU CAN'T HAVE THIS LEGISLATURE CAN'T BIND FUTURE LEGISLATURE'S. I'M SORRY COULD YOU REPEAT THE QUESTION SIR CAN YOU X. EXPLAIN TO ME HOW THIS DEAL AS ENFORCERS MORATORIUM IS ENFORCED IF. THIS LEGISLATURE CANNOT BIND FUTURE LEGISLATURE'S. IT'S THE STATUTE SO A LIKE ANY OTHER STATUTE ON THE LEGISLATURE RETAINS THE RIGHT TO AMEND STATUE IN A FUTURE YEAR. SO IS SO WHAT ALLEGES THAT SO NEXT YEAR OR TWO YOU COULD ANOTHER LEGEND YOU CAN CHANGE THE STATUTE. THAT'S CORRECT VICKI DON'T WORK. ARE THERE OTHER -- INSTANCES WHERE. WE'VE ACTUALLY PASSED BILLS THAT TAKE AWAY. CITIES RIGHT TO VOTE ON SOMETHING. THE REALLY BROAD QUESTION IMMUNOASSAY CERTAINLY THERE ARE THERE ARE. AT WELL I WOULD SAY YOU KNOW THERE HAVE BEEN OTHER ISSUES IN WHICH THE STATE HAS A SIZE TREATED UNIFORMLY THE ABILITY OF A SEAT. VOTE ON ITS ABILITY TO TAX. A SOFT KIRSTEN LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE I BELIEVE THERE IS STATE STATUTE THAT LIMITS LOCAL AUTHORITY TO IMPOSE. TOBACCO [inaudible] EXCISE TAXES. AT SO. TO TO OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. ON EITHER S. B. EIGHT SEVEN TWO OR AB. EIGHTEEN THIRTY OKAY SEEM NON PUBLIC COMMISSURE CHAIR I'M I'M JUST WONDERING IF THE LA O. COULD CLARIFY -- MR STONE'S. NAY IN THE DEBATE BETWEEN THEIR IF THEY LIKE THE WAY AND ABSOLUTE PLUS I'M SORRY AND YOU FORTUNATE DON'T THINK WE CAN IT REALLY DOES DEPEND ON THE INTERPRETATION OF THE TERM RE AUTHORIZE HERE IN THE LANGUAGE AND AND WE'RE NOT. I DON'T THINK WE'RE IN A POSITION TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL KERR CLARIFICATION THIS TIME UNFORTUNATELY [inaudible] THANK YOU. OKAY SEEING NO OTHER COMMENTS PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR THIS SPUR THESE BILLS. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS TERRY BRAND ON BEHALF OF SERVICE EMPLOYEES INTERNATIONAL UNION CALIFORNIA. I THINK A ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY DID A VERY GOOD JOB OF DESCRIBING -- THE ANGST AROUND THIS ISSUE -- I DON'T THINK ANYONE IS HAPPY WITH. HOW WE GOT HERE WHY WE GOT HERE BUT WE'RE HERE?

MISTER CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE BRIAN NELSON ABOUT THE AMERICAN FEDERATION OF STATE COUNTY AND MUNICIPAL EMPLOYEES ALSO SUPPORT A COMPROMISE OFFER THE REASONS STATED BY MY COLLEAGUE -- FORTUNATELY THIS IS -- THE SITUATION FIND THEMSELVES AND BUT ARE WE BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A PROVEN PATH TO MOVING FORWARD TO AND PREVENTING A WORST CASE SCENARIO THE NEGATIVELY IMPACTS BY OUR COMMUNITIES AND PROGRAMS THAT WE CARE ABOUT THOSE COMMUNITIES MOON. FOR REALLY IS A QUESTION ABOUT THE FUTURE OF OUR STATE -- SO WHAT RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN ABOUT. STUCK SUPERZOOM HAVE THE CALIFORNIA PROVIDE FIREFIGHTERS HERE IN SUPPORT AS WELL WOULD ECHO THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUES.

WE HAVE ON FROM A PUBLIC HEALTH PERSPECTIVE ATTEMPTED TO DO THIS ON THE STATEWIDE LEVEL SODA HAS THWARTED THOSE EFFORTS THIS IS A TOTAL POWER PLAY. ON PUBLIC HEALTH IS THE LOSER AND LOCALS HAVE ATTEMPTED TO DEAL WITH THIS AND HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN THOSE AREAS THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PULL TOGETHER TAXES THAT ARE PUT THAT OF PUT TOGETHER MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO GO TOWARD DEALING WITH PRE DIABETES DIABETES. HEART ALL AT THE OBESITY EPIDEMIC WE'RE DEALING WITH THESE COST AS WELL AND SO SAME ARGUMENTS THAT THE FOLKS HAVE MADE ON THE OTHER SIDE WILL MAKE ON THIS SIDE THIS STOPS LOCALS FROM DEALING WITH A LOCAL PROBLEM -- WE HAVE CERTAINLY. BEEN PRIOR COMMITTEE IN THE PRIOR COMMITTEE ON THE SENATE SIDE SAID WE WANT TO WORK WITH US YEAH YOU SINCE WE ARE NOW BEING STOPPED FROM DEALING WITH THIS LOCALLY WHERE WE'VE BEEN SUCCESSFUL WE WOULD LIKE TO WORK.

MY GRANDMOTHER WAS NEVER EDUCATED ON WHAT CONSUMING THE SUGAR SWEETENED BEVERAGES COULD YOU HELP THE AMERICAN BEVERAGE ASSOCIATION NEVER PROVIDED THIS EDUCATION BECAUSE THEY WANTED THEIR PROFIT.

NOW THEY GOT NOTHING TO DO NOW WE GOTTA FIGURE OUT A NEW STRATEGY. THE BIG CONCERN THAT I HAVE HERE IS HIGHER TAKING VOTERS RIGHTS AWAY FROM THAT. PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO VOTE ON THIS PROPOSITION THAT IS BEING PUT ON THE BALLOT BY ABA. SPECIAL INTEREST UNION SHOULDN'T DECIDE WHAT THE VOTERS WANT. VOTERS ARE SMART THEY CAN MAKE A GOOD CHOICE [inaudible] WEAPON DECIDE RIGHT BUT WE HAVE TO PUT UP A FIGHT. AND WE CANNOT SPECIAL INTERESTS WENT SPECIALLY IN THESE TIMES WHERE CALIFORNIA'S THAT SHINING CITY ON THE HILL. THAT'S PROVIDING HOPE TO THE NATION. WHERE WE PROVIDING THEM NOW? BY MAKING A DEAL WITH SPECIAL INTEREST. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS ZACH RECORD VOTE WITH THE CALIFORNIA DENTAL ASSOCIATION. FOR ALL OF THE REASONS STATED WE ARE OPPOSED TO BOTH BILLS. GOOD MORNING TURN MEMBERS MY NAME IS MICHELLE GIVENS AND I'M WITH THE COUNTY HEALTH EXECUTIVES ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA WE REPRESENT LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND WE ARE ACTUALLY WE TAKE WE TOOK A CONCERNS POSITION ON THIS BILL BECAUSE YOU RCOGNIZE THE DIFFICULT POSITION THAT WE'VE BEEN PLACED IN AS PART. OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT. AND I THINK. IN SOME OF THE ELOQUENT TESTIMONY AS YOU'VE HEARD BEFORE YOU ARE READY WE RECOGNIZE THE VALUE OF OF TAXES ON SODAS IN SUGAR SWEETENED BEVERAGES RECOGNIZE THAT IT'S NOT JUST A A FUNDING SOURCE FOR PUBLIC HEALTH PREVENTION ACTIVITIES. BUT IT ALSO RAISES AWARENESS ABOUT THE LINKAGE BETWEEN THE SUGARY BEVERAGES AND CHRONIC CONDITIONS SUCH AS DIABETES AND OBESITY. AND IT ALSO -- HELPS TO REDUCE CONSUMPTION IN THAT MANNER AND SO IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT FOR US TO SEE THE LOCAL ABILITY TO RAISE AND TAXES ON THESE BEVERAGES. AYE HINDER THROUGH THIS BAD THROUGH THIS MEASURE BUT WHAT WE DO RECOGNIZES THAT SHOULD THE INITIATIVE GO THROUGH IT WOULD BE MUCH MORE DAMAGING TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN TERMS OF RESTRICTING OUR ABILITY TO RAISE AT TAXES AND FEES ON A WHOLE HOST OF AREAS FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT. INCLUDING MAKING IT VERY DIFFICULT FOR GIVEN THE TWO THIRDS SWELLED AND SO THAT FOR THOSE REASONS AND WE JUST WANTED TO STATE OUR CONCERNS WITH APPROACH. BUT ALSO WOULD LIKE TO I REALLY EMPLOYER SOME CONVERSATION AROUND A STATEWIDE SOLUTION FOR FUNDING PREVENTION AND REDUCING CONSUMPTION AND WOULD LIKE AND WOULD STAND READY TO AND TO WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE. AND THE ADMINISTRATION ON A STATEWIDE SORT ATTACKS OR SUGAR SWEET WITH EFFORTS TO THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. OKAY CONDUCT TO THE COMMITTEE MISTER BLOOM. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- ALL HAVE FLOOD MORE. TO SAY ABOUT THIS TOPIC WHEN. THE A MEASURE REACHES THE FLOOR LATER THIS MORNING. A BUT I I WANTED. TO SAGE THAT I COME TO THIS INFORMATIONAL HEARING COULD I A AND AND THE LATER VOTE ON THIS ON THE FLOOR. OUT WITH JUST AT A SENSE OF ABJECT DISCUSSED [inaudible] ABSOLUTE [inaudible] SCOTT STE. AND I WANT TO ADDRESS. MY COMMENTS TO YOU BY MY COLLEAGUES -- BUT I WANT. TO PARTICULARLY SPEAK TO THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE HERE WHO ARE WATCHING THIS UNFOLD. AN I WANNA SPEAK ALSO TO THOSE WHO SIGNED PETITIONS THROUGHOUT THE STATE BECAUSE THERE WERE OVER FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE WHO SIGNED PETITIONS. AT THE BEHEST OF PEOPLE WHO CAME TO THEM IN YOUR FARMERS MARKETS IN YOUR SUPERMARKETS IN YOUR STORES AROUND YOUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES. AND THEY WERE TOLD. THAT IF THEY SIGNED ON THE DOTTED LINE IT WOULD HELP PUT A MEASURE ON THE BALLOT. THAT WOULD BE A TAXPAYER GOVERNMENTS. TO TOOK ONLY PASS. LOCAL REVENUE MEASURES WITH THE TWO THIRDS VOTE. THAT'S WHAT THEY WERE TOLD. AND WHO PAID FOR THAT. APPROXIMATELY EIGHT AND A QUARTER MILLION DOLLARS. HAS BEEN RAISED AS OF JUNE TWENTY THIRD IN SUPPORT OF THAT MEASURE. ONLY ABOUT THREE POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS OF THAT MONEY WAS SPENT BUT IT WAS I'M QUITE CERTAIN. VIRTUALLY ALL SPENT ON SIGNATURE GATHERING. AND THE SOURCE OF THOSE FUNDS. SEVEN MILLION OF THAT EIGHT IN A QUARTER ROUGHLY SEVEN MILLION. COCA COLA THREE MILLION DOLLARS PEPSI. TWO POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS. DOCTOR PEPPER ALMOST A MILLION DOLLARS AND THEN SMALLER AMOUNTS BY RED BULL AND THE AMERICAN BEVERAGE ASSOCIATION WHICH IS IN TURN SUPPORTED BY ALL THE BEVERAGE COMPANIES. AND YOU HAVE. TO ASK YOURSELF WILL YOU KNOW WHY ARE THOSE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE SUPPORTING THIS TWO THIRDS VOTE MEASURE. AND I THINK YOU KNOW VERY FEW PEOPLE PROBABLY GOT TO THAT POINT AS THEY WERE THINKING ABOUT SIGNING BECAUSE OF THESE PETITIONS. BUT NOW WE KNOW. BECAUSE WE'RE ALL BEING VICTIMIZED HERE BY A CLASSIC BAIT AND SWITCH. PEOPLE WHO SIGN THOSE PETITIONS WERE EXPECTING ONE THING AND WHAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY GONNA GET IS. THE STATE ASSEMBLY VOTING TO TAKE AWAY THEIR RIGHT TO VOTE AT ALL ON A COUPLE OF ISSUES. NOT BY TWO THIRDS VOTE. THEIR DEMOCRATIC RIGHT TO VOTE IS BEING TAKEN AWAY. WE WON'T BE ABLE TO VOTE ON LOCAL SODA TAXES WHICH HAVE PROVEN POPULAR. AMONGST LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. THEY WON'T BE ABLE TO VOTE. TECH THEIR OCEANS FROM PLASTIC POLLUTION [inaudible] THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS BECAUSE WE DO THIS. WITH A GUN TO OUR HEAD. AND WERE PLACED IN THAT POSITION AND FRANKLY WE KINDA PUT OURSELVES IN THIS POSITION BY TRYING TO REFORM. THE INITIATIVE SYSTEM BY PROVIDING THIS OPPORTUNITY TO NEGOTIATE AND WITHDRAW A MEASURE AND WHAT WE FIND OUT. WE FIND OUT THAT NOT ONLY IS THE INITIATIVE. SYSTEM BEING ABUSED IN BEING VICTIMIZED BY A AYE A YOU KNOW ANYBODY WHO CAN WRITE A BIG ENOUGH CHECK TODAY TO CUT TO COLLECT SIGNATURES. CAN GET SOMETHING ON THE BALLOT ANYBODY WITH A CRACKPOT IDEA CAN DO THIS. AND MEAN TO SAY THAT EVERY BALLOT MEASURE. THAT QUALIFIES AS A CRACKPOT MEASURE BUT YOU KNOW SOME OF THOSE IDEAS THAT ARE OUT THERE YOU READ ABOUT THEM IN YOUR NEWSPAPER SO WE TRIED TO DO SOMETHING TO REFORM THAT. AND NOW THE REFORM. IS PICKING ABUSED AND WERE THE VICTIMS OF OUR OWN REFORM SO I I AM DEEPLY DISAPPOINTED. THAT WE FIND OURSELVES HERE TODAY. I I SAY TO THOSE WHO SIGNED THE PETITIONS. WE'RE GONNA TRY AND FIX THE SYSTEM. AND TO THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE OVER HERE WHO WORK SO HARD ON THIS ISSUE AND WHO UNDERSTAND THE ISSUE AND A AND AND AND COME HERE TO SPEAK TO US NOT UNDERSTANDING. HOW WE COULD DO SUCH A THING? I A I SAY TO YOU DON'T GIVE UP HOPE. AND STAY ACTIVE. AND MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE HERE IN OUR FACES TELLING US. WHAT YOU WANT US TO DO DON'T GIVE UP HOPE? LET ME JUST CLOSE BY TALKING ON A A LITTLE BIT AND I WILL TALK MORE ABOUT THIS LATER ABOUT TARA ARE. I EPIDEMIC OF OBESITY AND DIABETES WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT I'VE WORKED ON FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS NOW AND I DON'T THINK IT'S A OF ON THE I THINK EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT I'VE BEEN VERY ACTIVE AND HAVE HAD. TO OF MULTIPLE PIECES OF LEGISLATION ON ON ON THIS TOPIC AND I UNDERSTAND THEY'RE JUST PEOPLE WHO DISAGREE BUT YOU CANNOT DISAGREE WITH FACTS. YOU NOT ENTITLED TO YOUR OWN FACTS HERE FACTS ARE FACTS WE ARE FACED WITH AN EPIDEMIC. PEOPLE ARE GETTING SICK PEOPLE ARE DYING. AND THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF STUDIES AND THE EVIDENCE THAT OUT THAT IS OUT THERE POINTS TO SUGAR. AND IN PARTICULAR SUGAR SWEETENED BEVERAGES SO WE NEED TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. BECAUSE THE LIVES OF CALIFORNIANS. ARE DEPENDING UPON US TO DO THAT. AND OF THOSE CALIFORNIANS IT'S PEOPLE OF COLOR AND DISADVANTAGED [inaudible] PEOPLE WHO ARE MOST AFFECTED. THE LET ME JUST CLOSE AGAIN BY TELLING YOU HOW HOW. A DEEPLY EMBARRASSED DIANNE BY WHERE WE ARE TODAY AND THE I ENCOURAGE YOU TO STAY ACTIVE. THANK YOU FOR INDULGENCE MISTER CHAIR.
