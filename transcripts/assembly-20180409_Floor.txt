ASSEMBLY CONCURRENT RESOLUTION TO AFFORD AYE FAMILY MEMBER BAKER RELATIVE TO EQUAL PAY DAY. MS BAKER YOUR RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS ON BEHALF OF THE LEGISLATIVE WOMEN'S CAUCUS I'M PLEASED TO PRESENT TO YOU TODAY ACR TWO OH FOR. WHICH COMMEMORATES APRIL TENTH OF THIS YEAR AS EQUAL PAY DAY AND NOT JUST REYES NOW BEHALF OF LEGISLATIVE WOMEN'S CAUCUS BUT ON BEHALF OF EVERY WOMAN AND GIRL IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND ALL WHO BELIEVE IN PAY EQUITY EVEN THOUGH IT IS ILLEGAL AT THE STATE AND FEDERAL LEVEL TO HAVE WAGE DISCRIMINATION THE GENDER WAGE. GAP STILL EXISTS AND IT'S VERY SEVERE IN CALIFORNIA. IN TWENTY ELEVEN THE GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY CENTER ON EDUCATION WORKFORCE FOUND THE COLLEGE EDUCATION WOMEN WORKING FULL TIME EARNED SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR LESS THAN THEIR MALE PEERS. AS RIP SORRY THAT'S OVER THEIR LIFETIME AS REPORTED BY THE UNITED STATES CENSUS BUREAU WOMEN WORKING FULL TIME YEAR ROUND IN TWENTY THIRTEEN TYPICALLY EARNED SEVENTY EIGHT PERCENT OF WHAT MEN EARNED. AND ACCORDING TO THE REPORT BY THE NATIONAL PARTNERSHIP FOR WOMEN AND FAMILIES IN APRIL OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN WOMEN IN CALIFORNIA ARE PAID EIGHTY SIX CENTS FOR EVERY DOLLAR PAID TO MEN. THAT AMOUNTS TO AN ANNUAL WAGE GAP IN OUR STATE OF OVER SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS. MISTER CALDERON STAGE A POINT OF ORDER. YOU CAN THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER MEMBERS IT IS LOUD ON THE FLOOR IN A LOT OF CONVERSATIONS ON MEMBER SETTING UP IF WE PLEASE TAKE OUR SEATS AND GIVE OUR. RESPECTFUL ATTENTION TO THE AUTHOR I REALLY APPRECIATE IT THANK YOU. ONE OF OUR IS WELL TAKEN. THANK YOU I THINK ARE OUR MAJORITY LEADER FOR THAT AND ALSO WITH THIS THIS IS IMPORTANT I HOPE THIS CONVERSATIONS ARE ABOUT WHAT WE CAN BE DOING TO SUPPORT PAY EQUITY IN THE WORKPLACE ALL AROUND CALIFORNIA. SINGLE WOMEN IN CALIFORNIA WITH CHILDREN AND WOMEN OF COLOR ARE ESPECIALLY HURT BY THE GENDER WAGE GAP. ACCORDING TO THE SIMPLE TRUTH ABOUT THE GENDER PAY GAP A REPORT BY THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF UNIVERSITY WOMEN AND TWENTY FOURTEEN AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMEN IN PARTICULAR EARNED SIXTY THREE PERCENT AND LATINA WOMEN EARN FIFTY FOUR PERCENT OF WHAT MEN EARNED. NOW CALIFORNIA HAS MADE A LOT OF PROGRESS IN THIS. I MEMBERS JUST IN MY FIRST TERM WE PASSED HISTORIC EQUAL PAY LEGISLATION THAT SHOULD BE THE MODEL. ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND THEN AGAIN LAST YEAR WE PASSED LEGISLATION TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE ENFORCING THAT BY ENSURING THAT YOUR PRIOR WAGE DOES NOT LOCK YOU INTO A LOWER WAGE GOING INTO NEW. O. JOB THAT YOU MAY HAVE THERE'S MUCH MORE WORK TO DO ONE OF THE NUMBER ONE THINGS WE CAN DO IN CALIFORNIA. TO SUPPORT PAY EQUITY IN THE WORKPLACE IS TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR WOMEN TO RETURN TO WORK. AFTER THEY'VE BEGUN TO START A FAMILY. AND THAT MEANS FLEXIBLE WORKWEEK ARRANGEMENTS FLEXIBLE WORK SCHEDULES FREEING UP THE RIGID RIGID RULES WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA THAT IMPAIR THE ABILITY OF EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEES TO BE ABLE TO REACH AGREEMENTS ON WHAT SCHEDULE WORKS BEST FOR THEM. BRINGING UP INNOVATIVE WORKPLACE TECHNOLOGY SO THAT WOMEN CAN WORK FROM THE HOME MORE ACTUALLY ALL PARENTS THERE'S A LOT MORE WORK TO DO IN THIS AND IT IS A BAD THING. THAT CALIFORNIA HAS THE GENDER WAGE GAP THAT WE DO AND THERE'S MORE THAT WE CAN DO ABOUT IT AND WE ALL HAVE TO DO IT TOGETHER REGARDLESS OF WHAT PARTY YOU'RE A MEMBER OF. THANK YOU MEMBERS I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE IN THE FIRST WILL BE OPEN FOR CO AUTHORS. THANK YOU MISS BAKER. MISTER GIBSON YOUR RECOGNIZE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS I RISE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS ON ACR TWO ZERO FOUR REGARDING PAY EQUITY FOR WOMEN. AND WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS GOOD FOR THIS GOOD A RESOLUTION BEFORE US. IN OUR CONVERSATION ON THE DISPARITY IN PAY BETWEEN WOMEN AND MEN THERE IS AN ADDITIONAL LAYER OF DISPARITY. BETWEEN BLACK WOMEN AND WOMEN OF COLOR. THE DATA FROM THE ECONOMIC POLICY INSTITUTE SHOW THAT BLACK WOMEN WORK MORE HOURS ON AVERAGE YET UNFORTUNATELY. THE GAP IN PAY. HAS INCREASED OVER TIME. AND WHILE TWO THIRDS OF BLACK WOMEN IN THE WORKFORCE HAS SOME POST SECONDARY EDUCATION. AT ABOUT THIRTY PERCENT HABIT BASSES AGREE SHE. A BACHELOR'S DEGREE OR HIGHER BLACK WOMEN ARE PAID LESS AT EVERY LEVEL OF EDUCATION. IT IS OFTEN SAID THAT IT TAKES A VILLAGE TO RAISE A CHILD BUT WE MUST ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT IT TAKES RESOURCES TO RAISE TO RAISE A VILLAGE. MONEY IN THE HANDS OF A WOMAN MEANS NOT FOOD IN THE BOWELS OF OUR CHILDREN STABILIZATION ACROSS. THE COMMUNITY. WE TALK ABOUT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES LET US NOT FORGET THE IMPORTANCE OF PAYING A PAY EQUITY WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK WHEN I VOTE ON ACR TWO ZERO FOUR. THANK YOU MISS GIPSON MISS GONZALEZ FLETCHER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU YOU KNOW I SPEAK ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA LATINO CAUCUS IN SUPPORTING THIS RESOLUTION ON PAY EQUITY BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO TALK MORE ABOUT WHY WE THINK PAY EQUITY ARE PAID IN EQUITY IS WRONG. I THINK THAT'S CLEAR WOMEN SHOULDN'T MAKE LESS THAN MEN. WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT. HOW WE SOLVE THAT ISSUE IN THERE IS ONE THING THAT IS ABSOLUTELY WITH OUT A DOUBT THE BEST WAY TO REDUCE PAY INEQUITY AND THAT IS BY UNIONIZING MORE WORKERS? WE KNOW THAT ANY UNIONIZED WORKFORCE WOMEN MAKE NINETY FOUR CENTS ON THE DOLLAR OF THEIR MALE COUNTERPARTS. THAT'S IN COMPARISON TO SEVENTY EIGHT CENTS ON THE DOLLAR IN A NON UNIONIZED ARE RIGHT IT TOTAL ENVIRONMENT ACTUALLY. WE KNOW IN THE FEMALE DOMINATED SERVICE SECTOR. THAT WOMEN WHO ARE IN THE UNION MAKE EIGHTY SEVEN PERCENT MORE WHEN YOU COUNT PAY AND BENEFITS THAN THEIR NON UNION COUNTERPARTS WE KNOW THAT IF YOU WANT TO RAISE UP WOMEN. THAT YOU ALLOW COLLECTIVE BARGAINING IN ORGANIZING AND YOU DON'T ATTACK THE EIGHT HOUR DAY INSTEAD WE DO THINGS THAT ENSURE THAT ALL WOMEN UNDER. AN AGREEMENT A CONTRACT HAVE TO BE PAID AT EQUAL RATES OF THEIR MALE COUNTERPARTS WE ALSO KNOW THAT HIGHER AND AWAY AGE BRACKETS THAT TRANSPARENCY LEADS TO PAY EQUITY. SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT TODAY WE TALK ABOUT THE DISPARITIES AND HOW TERRIBLE IT IS LET'S ALSO COMMIT OURSELVES TO FINDING WAYS TO REDUCE THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. MR THURMAN YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND COLLEAGUES I RISE IN SUPPORT OF ACR. TWO ZERO FOUR WHICH WILL PROCLAIM TOMORROW AS EQUAL PAY DAY. AS CHAIR OF LABOR AS A FATHER OF TWO YOUNG GIRLS. I'M COMMITTED TO ENSURING THAT WOMEN RECEIVE THE EQUAL PAY FOR EQUAL WORK THAT THEY DESERVE. YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT REPORTS TODAY THAT TALK ABOUT THE GAP IN CALIFORNIA IS BEING EIGHTY SIX CENTS ON THE DOLLAR. FOR WHAT WOMEN EARN COMPARED TO MEN THAT MEANS SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS LESS PER YEAR. THAT MEANS LESS MONEY TO PAY THE RENT. LESS MONEY TO PAY THE MORTGAGE AND SUPPORT WAS FAMILY LESS MONEY FOR EDUCATION OR FOR SAVING OR FOR RETIREMENT. WHAT YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT THE DISPROPORTION ALLEY? IN THIS GAP AND HOW IT IMPACTS BLACK WOMEN AT A RATE ARE BEING PAID SIXTY THREE PERCENT. WHAT MEN ARE AND LATINOS FIFTY FOUR PERCENT OF WHAT WHITE MEN ARE? THIS LEGISLATURE HAS TAKEN GREAT STRIDES IN ADDRESSING THIS ISSUE BY ENACTING THE CALIFORNIA FAIR PAY ACT. WHICH I WAS PROUD TO SUPPORT. I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK TO CLOSE THE PAY GAP AND ENSURE THAT WOMEN BE SAYER RECEIVED THE PAY THAT THEY HAVE EARNED MEMBERS PLEASE JOIN ME IN SUPPORTING. ACR TWO ZERO FOUR. THANK YOU MISTER. BERMAN ALL THIS QUESTION HAVING SEES MS BAKER YOU MAY CLOSE IF YOU WISH. THANK YOU I THINK OUR COLLEAGUES FOR THE THOUGHTFUL ADDITIONAL. WERE TO SUPPORT AND ALL THAT KIND OF SOLUTIONS THAT WE CAN BE CONSIDERING AND DEBATE ON THIS ISSUE. GETTING RID OF THE GENDER WAGE GAP ISN'T JUST A QUESTION OF FAIRNESS IT'S ALSO ONE OF ECONOMIC SECURITY. BECAUSE WOMEN TWO THIRDS OF WOMEN IN CALIFORNIA WHO WORK OUTSIDE THE HOME ARE THE PRIMARY. OR LARGE. WAGE EARNERS FOR THEIR FAMILIES THEY'RE THE BREADWINNERS FOR THEIR FAMILIES AND WHEN THEY ARE PAID LESS WE ARE UNDERMINING THEIR ABILITY TO TAKE CARE OF THEIR FAMILIES AND BE ABLE TO HAVE GOOD ECONOMIC SECURITY IN OUR STATE. IN THERE'S A A MYTH OUT THERE THAT THE WAGE GAP IS THERE JUST BECAUSE WOMEN DO LEAVE THE WORK FORCE TO HAVE CHILDREN AND FAMILIES. THE WAGE GAP IS EVIDENT IN CAREERS ACROSS THE BOARD AS EARLY AS THE FIRST YEAR OUT OF COLLEGE. SO IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER WE NEED TO EDUCATE ONE ANOTHER ABOUT WHAT THE MYTHS ARE THE CAUSE OF GENDER WAGE DISPARITY WE NEED TO TACKLE HEAD ON. AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTING AGAIN THANK YOU FOR ADDING HONEST CO AUTHORS. IT WAS BAKER THE AUTHORS ASKING THAT THE FIRST WILL BE OPEN FOR CALL AUTHORS.

THE REALITY IS IT'S LESS DANGEROUS BECAUSE WE'RE ABLE TO PROVIDE SOME KIND OF CARE FOR INDIVIDUALS IN THE PROCESS BUT ONE. WOULD COMMUNITIES DO NOT GET ADEQUATE PRENATAL CARE AND SUPPORT. THAT WE HAVE TRAGEDY THAT SEVERE. CALIFORNIA OF THE UNITED STATES RATHER UNITED STATES HAS NEARLY UP THREE TIMES MORE THE CHILDREN WILL DIE. FROM. FROM BASICALLY A WOMEN WILL DIE FROM CHILDBIRTH EIGHT HUNDRED WOMEN ALL ACROSS THE NATION WILL DIE EVERYDAY FROM CHILDBIRTH. AND THE UNITED STATES IT WITH ALL OF ITS SOPHISTICATED MEDICAL. INFORMATION AS WELL AS FACILITIES WE STILL HAD LEFT FAR BEHIND MOST OF THE OF THE WEALTHY DEVELOPED COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD WHEN IT COMES CHILD BIRTH AND DEATH FROM CHILDBIRTH. THE TRAGEDY IS ALSO THAT IT IS MAGNIFIED BY THOSE WHO ARE POOR AND PEOPLE OF COLOR WHO HAVE ACCESS WITH LIMITED ACCESS TO PRENATAL CARE. AND AS A RESULT OF THAT THE BLACK INFANT MORTALITY IS BASICALLY TWICE THAT OF THE WHITE POPULATION IN THE STATION. AND BASICALLY IS COMPARABLE TO THIRD WORLD COUNTRIES SO IS VERY IMPORTANT AS WE THINK ABOUT IT BECAUSE MOST OF US DON'T THINK CHILDBIRTH IS A DANGEROUS THING AND YET IT CAN BE. IT IS NOT PROPERLY CARED FOR IT WAS ALWAYS NUMBER ONE KILLER OF WOMEN IN THE EARLY PART OF THE CENTURY AND SO WE'RE MOVING MORE IN THAT DIRECTION BY NOT TAKING INTO SUSAN'S AS WE COULD. AND BASICALLY MAKING SURE THAT ALL POPULATIONS HAVE ACCESS TO PRENATAL CARE THAT'S GOOD TO HEAR THAT ALLOWS THE BABY TO BE BORN HEALTHY AS WELL AS A MOTHER TO SURVIVE THE PREGNANCY. IN A HEALTHY STATE I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE FOR HR NINETY FIVE WE ARE DEVELOPED COUNTRY AND OUR WOMEN AND CHILDREN SHOULD FEEL THE MAGNITUDE OF.
