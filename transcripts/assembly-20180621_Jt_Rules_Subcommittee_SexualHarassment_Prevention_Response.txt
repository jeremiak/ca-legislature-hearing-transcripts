ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRIEDMAN HERE FRIEDMAN HERE ASSEMBLY MEMBER DOLLY HERE SUMMER DAILY HERE BREA'S HERE REYES HERE WALDRON. WALDRON HERE SENATOR MITCHELL. SENATOR MITCHELL HERE SENATOR BATES. FULLER BATES HERE SENATOR LEYVA CENTER LEYVA HERE SENATOR MORLOCK. SUTTER MALEK HERE. WE HAVE. THANK YOU. ARE TODAY IS OF THE EIGHT HEARING. OF THIS COMMITTEE AND I EXPECTED TO BE THE LAST OF THIS SUBCOMMITTEE BEFORE WE SEND A POWER RECOMMENDED POLICY FRAMEWORK TO JOINT RULES. HOPEFULLY FOR ADOPTION OR MODIFICATION I WANT TO THANK ALL OF THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR YOUR HARD WORK I DON'T THINK WE HAD ANY ABSENCES IN THIS HEARING. EVERYBODY WORKED. A VERY HARD -- VERY COOPERATIVELY IN A VERY BIPARTISAN MANNER AND I'M VERY PROUD OF THE FINAL RESULT. WE MET ON MONDAY TO GO OVER IN MORE DETAIL THE RECOMMENDED -- FRAMEWORK FOR A NEW SEXUAL HARASSMENT POLICIES WHICH COVER EVERYTHING FROM TRAINING TO REPORTING. TO ADJUDICATION -- ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE PROCESS MORE MAKING A LOT OF VERY FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES -- THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF WHAT'S GOING TO BE WORKING PROGRESS OVER TIME THAT WE WILL CONSTANTLY BE REEVALUATING I'M SURE AND TWEAKING. A SUIT OUR NEEDS BUT I THINK THAT WE'RE STARTING WITH A VERY VERY STRONG OF FRAMEWORK THAT'S GOING TO MAKE A LOT OF FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES. WE HEARD SEVERAL COMMENTS ON MONDAY AND HAVE CHANGED -- OUR DOCUMENT TO REFLECT AS MANY OF THOSE COMMENTS I'M JUST GOING -- TO BRIEFLY GO THROUGH THOSE BEFORE I DO I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IF MY A VICE CHAIR SENATOR HOLLY MITCHELL HAS ANY COMMENTS AT THIS TIME NO [inaudible] GREAT SO. THE COMMENTS THAT WE HEARD THAT WE HAVE MADE -- MODIFICATIONS THE DOCUMENT AND AND JUST SO EVERYONE KNOWS THERE ARE TWO DOCUMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN PROVIDED TO THE SUBCOMMITTEE ONE DOCUMENT WITH THE RED LINE CHANGES AND ANOTHER DOCUMENT THAT IS A NOW COMPLETE NEW DOCUMENT. AND I'M GOING TO HIGHLIGHT THE FIVE ITEMS THAT WERE CHANGED. THEY ARE THE FIRST I HAD TO DO WITH LOBBYISTS A CONCERN RAISED BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER REYES AND OTHERS. WHICH IS TO MAKE THE RECOMMENDATIONS CLEARER ON THE AVAILABILITY OF THIS PROCESS TO A DIRECT THE CLOCK KIND UP OF LOBBYISTS AND OTHERS AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS REFLECTED IN THE DOCUMENT AND WILL BE A DISCUSSION POINT -- FOR JOINT RULES ON MONDAY AND SOMETHING THAT WE WILL LOOK AT FINDING WAYS OF INCORPORATING INTO OUR POLICY. AND BY THE WAY BECAUSE I'M GONNA TAKE THESE ONE AT A TIME IF ANYBODY HAS A COMMENT ON A SPECIFIC ITEM. YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND MAKE IT BEFORE I MOVE TO THE NEXT ITEM SO ANY COMMENTS ON THAT ITEM. OKAY. THE SECOND I'M A BROUGHT UP CRIMINAL CASES THAT WE HAVE CLARIFIED THAT CRIMINAL CONDUCT WILL BE REFERRED DIRECTLY TO LAW ENFORCEMENT. BUT WE WILL ALSO ALLOW THE INVESTIGATION TO BE SUSPENDED OR TO PROCEED DEPEND ON INTERNALLY AS WELL DEPENDING ON THE CIRCUMSTANCES. I'M THE THIRD COMMENT IS ABOUT PANEL APPOINTMENTS. WHICH WAS A CONCERN OF TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER DOLLY AND WALDRON AND OTHERS WE'RE GOING TO CLARIFY THE PANEL APPOINTMENT PROCESS TO ENSURE THAT THE PANEL IS NON PARTISAN. BY REQUESTING THAT THE CHIEF JUSTICE APPOINT THE MAJORITY OF THE PANEL MEMBERS AS A MEMBER DALY. THANK YOU AND THE FIRST I WOULD SAY THAT. IT'S BEEN A REAL PLEASURE -- TO SIT ON THIS COMMITTEE AND TO BE ABLE TO ENGAGE WITH MY COLLEAGUES FROM FROM THE SENATE AND THE ASSEMBLY -- AND I THINK THAT. AS YOU STATED EARLIER THAT THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS AND WERE WERE TAKING TO DO -- SOMETHING THAT HASN'T BEEN DONE. IN THE ASSEMBLY OR THE SENATE FOR A LONG TIME AND AND BRING -- SHED LIGHT ON ON SOME SITUATIONS SO I WANT TO COMMEND THIS COMMITTEE AND AND TO SHOW THE SERIOUSNESS OF IT -- YOU KNOW WE MISSED A MEETING IN THAT THAT'S RARE. TO HAPPEN -- IN THIS BUILDING. SO WITH THIS NUMBER DO WITH THIS ITEM HERE I WANTED -- TO I HAVE A SUGGESTION AND I AM BY THE WAY I I I HERE'S WHAT. MY GOAL AND I TRY -- MONDAY THAT. FOR ME THE GOAL IS TO MAKE IT AS NONPARTISAN -- AS THE POLICY AS WE CAN GET SO. I HAVE A SUGGESTION HERE THAT THAT COME AND I JUST LEARNED -- A FEW MINUTES AGO ABOUT HOW THE DIFFERENCES OF THE TWO HOUSES WORK. WHICH I WASN'T A TOTALLY AWARE OF SO I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU THAT I THINK THAT IT'S APPROPRIATE THAT [inaudible] THE IF JUSTICE APPOINT THREE I THINK THAT'S A GREAT START BUT OF THE REMAINING. TWO COM. THAT EACH HOUSE SO I SAID THIS IS MY SUGGESTION THAT EACH HOUSE. BUT USED THE REMAINING ONE SO WE GET TO A A TOLL OF FIVE AND THAT THE THE MINORITY LEADER IN THIS SPEAKER. WORK TOGETHER ON OUR SIDE TO POINT OUT AND THE MINORITY LEADER AND THE PRO TO HIM ON THE OTHER SIDE. COME INTO AGREEMENT TO POINT THAT SO THAT TAKES OUT ALL PARTISANSHIP -- ON THAT FIVE PERSON PANEL SO THAT'S WHAT I WOULD SUGGEST BE THE PROCESS -- MOVING FORWARD SO ON AND SO IN TODAY'S WORLD IT WOULD BE. A ANTHONY I AND AND ON THE SENATE TONY AND PASS. AND SO THAT WOULD THAT WOULD THAT MAKE IT THEY COULD WORK TOGETHER FOUND IN AGREEMENT WITH THAT APPOINTMENT SO WE GET TO A REALLY. A NONPARTISAN -- UP. COMMITTEE THAT CAN LOOK AT THESE CASES AND COME UP WITH THAT. A SO IT AGAIN SO THAT THERE'S NO WAY THAT IT'S WAITED BIPARTISANSHIP AT ALL. THANK YOU FOR THAT EXCELLENT SUGGESTION -- MOVING ON FOLLOW UP WITH COMPLAIN TIM TEHAMA ASSEMBLY MEMBER WALDRON HAD BROUGHT THIS UP. AND WE HAVE I CLARIFIED THAT THE DIRECT VOTE TO DIRECT THE INDEPENDENT UNIT TO PROVIDE UPDATES TO THE COMPLAIN SO THAT THEY UNDERSTAND THAT THE PROCESS IS ONGOING. AND THAT IT'S BEING DEALT WITH -- LASTLY MANDATORY REPORTING AGAIN ASSEMBLY MEMBER WALDRON AND OTHERS HOME WE'RE GOING TO CONFORM THE RECOMMENDATION SOME POLICY TO CLEARLY REQUIRE SUPERVISORS TO REPORT COMPLAINTS OF INAPPROPRIATE CONDUCT. AND OF COURSE WE'RE GOING TO BE TRAINING THAT ENCOURAGING ALL EMPLOYEES TO REPORT IF -- HOW INAPPROPRIATE CONDUCT IF THEY WITNESSES -- AT THE VERY LEAST TO FIND OUT IF IT'S SOMETHING THAT IS REPORTABLE SO THAT'S GOING TO BE AN ONGOING. TRAINING -- GOAL AS WE WORK WITH OUR EMPLOYEES -- WITHOUT IT THERE'S NO MORE COMMENTS ABOUT THE CHANGES. I'M I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT AND THEN I'LL COME BACK BUT LET US ALL GO NOW TO OF SENATOR BATES. BOTH A FEW AYE TERROR THOUGHT RIGHT. THIS IS NOT INCLUDED IN YOUR CURRENT DOCUMENT AS AN AMENDMENT IT'S A SUGGESTION THAT WE PUT FORWARD WHEN WE REACH JOINT RULES. IT IT HAS TO DO A SECTION FIVE A RETAIN HOW SECURITY DETERMINE APPROPRIATE RESPONSE TO REPORTS. FAR IN THE LAST LINE ON SECTION IT SAYS THE CHAIR OF THE RELEVANT RULES COMMITTEES WHO WILL RECEIVE A COPY OF EACH REPORT. THAT SUGGESTED ONLY TO INDIVIDUALS ARE GOING TO GET THE REPORT CANDID THAT PUTS A HUGE BURDEN ON THE DOWN. SIDE PERHAPS BEING A PROBLEM. I HATE TO USE THE WORD ACCUSED BUT THE PERCEPTION MIGHT BE THAT THEY COULD BURY A REPORT ON SOMEONE. FOLLOWING IN THE SORT OF THE APPROVAL EASIER A AND SO I'M SUGGESTING THAT OUT WE ADD WE STRIKE. THE LANGUAGE THAT SAYS THE CHAIR OF THE RELEVANT RULES COMMITTEE WILL RECEIVE A COPY OF EACH REPORT AN AD. IN THE SENATE EACH REPORT SHALL BE SIMULTANEOUSLY PROVIDED TO ALL FIVE MEMBERS OF THE RULES COMMITTEE THAT'S HOW IT OPERATES ON THE SENATE SIDE. IN THE SECRETARY OF THE SENATE IN INDIAN THE ASSEMBLY EACH REPORT SHALL BE SIMULTANEOUSLY PROVIDED TO THE CHAIR AND THE VICE CHAIR OF THE ASSEMBLY RULES COMMITTEE. AND THE ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICER OF THE ASSEMBLY AND THAT PROVIDES A BROADER DISTRIBUTION AND I CHAIRMAN. FOR FREE CHAIRWOMAN FRIEDMAN HAD ON THE QUESTION REGARDING BY WOULD THAT INCLUDE ALL REPORTS EVEN THOSE WERE THERE WAS JUST AN INAPPROPRIATE COMMENT THAT DOESN'T LICENSE. I THINK WE COULD THINK ABOUT THAT BETWEEN NOW AND THEY ON IN AFTER SPUR APPROPRIATE LANGUAGE THAT ALL CAN KNOW. MAYBE FACTOR INTO IT THAT'S FINE BUT I THINK IF I WERE THE PRO TIM AND I WAS GOING TO BE THE ONLY ONE THAT GOT THE REPORTED IF YOU REMEMBER THERE WAS A LITTLE DUST UP ABOUT THAT EARLIER. THAT'S THAT'S NOT A GOOD BURDEN TO PUT ON THE INDIVIDUALS ON WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING. LIKE THIS THE CULTURE CHANGES IF THERE'S ANY SORT OF FAVORITISM OR LACK OF TRANSPARENCY SO I THINK IT WOULD HAVE BEEN ADDRESSES BOTH OF THOSE ISSUES THAT. WE HAVE SPOKEN ABOUT ON THE COMMITTEE ARE ALL OVER THE OVER THE COURSE OF OUR DISCUSSIONS AND TRANSPARENCY IS IMPORTANT AND WE WOULD ALL. YOU KNOW HAVE A COPY AT THE SAME TIME COUNT OF THE SAME INFORMATION. THANK YOU SENATOR MITCHELL YES THANK YOU MISS BATES I APPRECIATE ON THE PERSPECTIVE IN THE DRAFT LANGUAGE -- AND I THINK -- AS MY COLLEAGUE JUST MENTION RECOGNIZE THAT THE THAT THE TO SENATE RULES COMMITTEE IS REALLY HAVE DIFFERENT CORE FUNCTIONS AND OPERATE VERY DIFFERENT WILL BE IMPORTANT WE MAKE SURE. THAT THE LANGUAGE JUST APPLIES TO BOTH -- RULES COMMITTEES APPROPRIATELY AND IN THAT WE ARE CONTINUE TO TALK ABOUT THE DETAILS AND TAKE IT UP ON A MONDAY WHEN THE JOINT RULES COMMITTEE MADE. OKAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU I'M SENATOR MORLOCK. MADAME CHAIR -- I'VE A LOT OF QUESTIONS BUT I'M SKINNER DOWN THE THREE HAVE BECAUSE WE'RE GONNA. YOU KNOW WE'VE HAD SHORT NOTICE HE JUST GOT. THE DRAFT SYSTEM. CLEARLY JUST FRIDAY -- BUT LOOK AT THIS IS GONNA BE. BUT IT'S GOING TO THE THREE QUESTIONS ARE GONNA GET ONCE WE STEP OUT OF THE ROOM AND WE GET A REPORTER INTERVIEWS THE FIRST HIS. BUT THAT THERE'S A CRITICISM THAT. THE POLICY DOESN'T RECOMMEND CHANGING STATE LAW TO REQUIRE THAT DOCUMENTS ABOUT THE LEGISLATURE'S HARASSMENT ENQUIRIES. OR FINDINGS BE MADE PUBLIC WHICH OF MY ANSWER BE. I WOULD TO SUBMIT OKAY OKAY ALL A LEAD ON SENATOR MITCHELL A POEM -- RESPOND FIRST. BUT THEN THE MORE LACKEY YOU'VE BEEN EMPLOYER BEFORE AND WE'RE EMPLOYER NOW AND I THINK -- WHAT WHAT'S BEEN UNIQUE ABOUT THIS PROCESS FOR ME I THINK I'VE BEEN -- CERTAINLY THE ONE TO CONSTANTLY SAY IT IN ALL OF OUR MEETINGS ON BOTH PUBLICLY AND PRIVATELY THAT WHERE AN EMPLOYER. AND WE ARE DEVELOPING A POLICY TO GOVERN. OF OUR INTERNAL WORKPLACE BEHAVIOR. I THINK THAT WE HAVE STEPPED UP TO THE PLATE IN A MEANINGFUL WAY. TO HAVE A PUBLIC PROCESS -- ON IT IN THESE NOW EIGHT HEARINGS TO HELP DEVELOP THE PROCESS. FUNDAMENTALLY IT IS AN H. OUR POLICY. AND I KNOW THAT -- IS -- FOR SOME CHALLENGING IN TERMS OF ON THIS AND ADESIRE FOR TRANSPARENCY AND I BELIEVE THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS PROCESS HAS BEEN TRANSPARENT. AND TO THE DEGREE THAT IT IS APPROPRIATE IN THAT IT IS A EACH OUR POLICY. FOR A WORKPLACE THE POLICY WE DEVELOPED HAS BEEN TRANSPARENT WILL CONTINUE -- TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS TO MAKE IT POWELL PALATABLE TO US THE EMPLOYERS. BUT WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT AS EMPLOYERS WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO PROTECT THE PRIVACY OF EMPLOYEES. AND SO TRANSPARENCY WE TALK THAT EARLIER HEARING ABOUT SEMANTICS AND HOW WE CAN KIND OF THROW WORDS AROUND IN THIS EXPECTATIONS TRANSPARENCY. BUT THIS IS AN INTERNAL. H. OUR POLICY. FOR THE SECOND QUESTION ME JUST ADD TO THAT IF I MIGHT -- I THINK IT'S ALSO WORTH POINTING OUT THAT THE MODEL THAT WE FACED A LOT OF THIS POLICY ON AND WHICH IS THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY'S MODEL. HAS NO TRANSPARENCY NOTHING IS DISCLOSED AS FAR AS I KNOW -- TO THE PRESS OR TO OUTSIDE GROUPS WHETHER IT'S ABOUT -- INVESTIGATIONS OF ELECTED OFFICIALS OR INTO ANY OF THEIR INTERNAL STAFF EVEN HIGH LEVEL STAFF. WEIRD WE MADE ITS DECISION IN THIS PANEL TO GO BEYOND THAT. AND TO DISCLOSE SERIOUS ALLEGATIONS SUSTAINED ALLEGATIONS AGAINST MEMBERS AND SENIOR STAFF -- WHICH IS MORE THAT MANY PUBLIC PUB MANY PUBLIC AGENCIES ARE DOING THERE' A VERY LARGE CITY IN CALIFORNIA THAT WAS ON THE FRONT PAGE OF THE LA TIMES THIS WEEK ABOUT. SEXUAL HARASSMENT ALLEGATIONS IN VERY HIGH LEVELS OF THEIR CITY DEPARTMENT AND THEY SAID WE ARE GOING TO SAY THAT THESE ALLEGATIONS ARE I I'M HAVE BEEN TAKEN IN. BUT WE DO NOT DISCLOSE THE NAMES OF THE USED SO. WE ARE ACTUALLY GOING BEYOND WHAT MANY PUBLIC AGENCIES ARE DOING WITH DISCLOSURE. AND AND I THINK THAT THAT'S APPROPRIATE APPROPRIATE THAT WHEN IT COMES TO MEN AND TO MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE THAT WHEN THERE ARE SERIOUS. SUSTAINED ALLEGATIONS THAT WE CONTINUE OUR CURRENT POLICY THAT WE HVE RECENTLY ESTABLISHED OF SEND OF RELEASING THAT -- TO THE PUBLIC SO WE ARE A CONTINUING THAT THAT PROCESS THAT WAS SET INTO MOTION I BELIEVE EARLIER THIS YEAR -- UPSET SO THANK YOU GO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THAT I GO TO THE GREAT QUESTION NUMBER. TWO SUMMER AGAIN I SAY IT YOU KNOW THERE PROBABLY ISN'T REAL INDEPENDENCE BECAUSE WE'RE USING THE LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL. BUT WHAT I SAY THAT. LET ME AY LET ME SAY THAT WE ARE DESIGNING THIS IN OUR INSTRUCTION IS THAT EVEN THOUGH THIS BODY IS SORT OF HOUSE UNDERNEATH THE UMBRELLA OF LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL WERE CALLING IT THE INDEPENDENT UNIT FOR A REASON. THAT WE ARE DIRECTING. THAT POLICY TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT UNIT IS SOCIETY LOADS OF THAT INDEPENDENT COUNSEL DOES NOT IMPACT OUR WAY ON THE PANEL'S DECISION. SO THAT WILL BE DONE THROUGH THE WAY THROUGH DESIGN AND THROUGH INSTRUCTIONS AND THAT WILL BE THE POLICY GOING FORWARD. SECOND I THINK YOU KNOW FUNCTIONALLY A WE TALK ABOUT INDEPENDENT UNIT THEY HAVE TO BE HOUSE SOMEPLACE PAID BY SOMEBODY REPORT I MEAN. AND SO. WHERE ELSE COULD THEY BE HOW COULD THEY SERVE AND WE'VE LOOKED AT ALL KINDS OF OPTIONS -- AND AGAIN I THINK THAT WE'VE CREATED -- ENOUGH FIRE WALLSAND HOW'S THAT IN THE PLACE -- THAT IS TRULY BY CAMEL ON A LEDGE COUNCIL SERVES BOTH AND AFTER YOU ASKWITH ALL YOUR QUESTION I WOULD BE INTERESTED IN TERMS OF WHAT YOUR ANSWERS WOULD BE IN TERMS OF YOUR PERSPECTIVE OF OF THE POLICY. APPRECIATE YOUR DEFENSIVENESS SIDE. SOME OF THE DEFENSE OF ONE OF MY ABOUT IT WE'RE ALL GOING TO BE THAT WE'RE ALL GOING TO BE YOU KNOW ASTON SO I I SAW GIVE YOU THE LAST ONE OKAY BATON REALLY ADMIT WITH SINCERE IN TERMS OF WHAT. I WHAT I'M HEARING ABOUT YOUR OPINION -- INDEPENDENCE. WHEN THE COUNTY OF ORANGE HAD ITS IN LONG? EPISODE IN CHAPTER WE ACTUALLY ESTABLISHED -- PANEL BUT IT WAS -- OF INTERNAL INDIVIDUALS IT WAS THE COUNTY COUNCIL IT WAS THE INTERNAL AUDIT DIRECTOR AND I CANNOT RECALL. RIGHT NOW THE THIRD SO I AS A SUPERVISOR THAT WAS. ADEQUATE DID EVERY COMPLAINT WOULD BE ADDRESSED AND THAT IT WAS. INDIVIDUALS REPORTING TO ME -- DIDN'T SEEM TO BE A PROBLEM BECAUSE THEY WERE SORT OF INDEPENDENT. JUST IN THEIR ROLES COUNTY COUNCIL WHO HOW ARE WHO ARGUES WITH COUNTY COUNCIL WHO ARGUES WITH THE INTERNAL AUDITOR. AND AND SO I WAS COMFORTABLE. WITH IT SO SO THAT OUR SYSTEM IS KIND OF A DIFFERENT RELIGION THAT THAT'S A GOOD THING YOU'RE DOING GREAT I'M GLAD I ACTUALLY QUITE ENJOY HERE COMES THE TOUGHEST. ONE OKAY. NOW I JUST -- WHETHER OR NOT. IT'S STILL A PROCESS THAT GIVES. INDIVIDUALS ASSURANCE BECAUSE IT'S STILL THE LEGISLATORS AT THE END OF THE DAY THAT OVERSEE LIKE I JUST SAID. THE LEDGE COUNCIL AND WE EVEN SELECT. OR APPROVED CHIEF JUSTICE SO WE STILL HAVE. SOME KIND OF CONTROL AND SO THAT. ALSO KIND OF MAKES A COMMENT ABOUT INDEPENDENT I HAD HER WE WERE MEETING THAT. WELL THAT LEGISLATORS DON'T WEIGH IN ON THE PANELS DETERMINATION IT WHETHER OR NOT THERE WAS A VIOLATION. WHO DOES THE PUNISHMENT WELL THAT'S WHAT THE PANEL MAKES RECOMMENDATIONS ABOUT WHAT THE RESPONSE WILL BE PUNISHMENT RESPONSE HOW EVERYONE CALLED TRAINING WHATEVER WHATEVER THEIR RESPONSES? AND JUST LIKE IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY THERE STILL NEEDS TO BE SOME DISCUSSION FOR THE EMPLOYER IN TERMS OF HOW THAT WORKS AND AND WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE BECAUSE THE PANEL. THERE AND THEY'RE OUTSIDE PEOPLE WHO COME IN TO LOOK AT THE INDIVIDUAL SITUATION AND SAY. WHAT YOU KNOW THEY THEY WILL KNOW THE POLICY AND TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THAT DETERMINATION BUT THEY'RE ALSO NOT IN THE OFFICE IS TO REALLY? KIND OF NO NECESSARILY. WHAT IS CERTAIN INDIVIDUAL DOES DAY TODAY WHAT'S THE MOST APPROPRIATE RESPONSE THEY CAN MAKE A RECOMMENDATION MY GUESS IS IN MANY CASES IT WILL BE A FAIRLY BROAD RECOMMENDATION WE THINK THIS WAS VERY SERIOUS I SHOULD BE A LOT OF DISCIPLINE? BUT THEY MAY NOT SAY AND THAT DISCIPLINE MEANS. YOU KNOW WHAT THIS OUT OF THE OTHER THING A BUT FOR MEMBERS WE DON'T WE DON'T KNOW IN MAYBE BUT I THINK FOR MEMBERS. YOU KNOW LET'S BE HONEST THE MOST DISCIPLINE YOU CAN GIVE A MATT MEMBER OF THE LEGISLATURE IS PUBLIC DISCLOSURE. YOU KNOW WE ARE WE CAN'T BE FIRED. THERE'S BEEN SOME DISCIPLINE THAT CAN BE HANDED OUT COMMITTEES CAN BE TAKEN AWAY YOU CAN BE THROWN OUT OF CAUCUS AT THE VERY END YOU COULD BE EXPELLED FOR YOU KNOW EGREGIOUS VIOLATIONS ALTHOUGH IT DOES NOT DOESN'T HAPPEN VERY OFTEN. BUT BEING ON THE FRONT PAGE OF THE NEWSPAPER SAYING THAT YOU'VE HAD A SUSTAINED [inaudible] SERIOUS ALLEGATION OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT -- THAT'S VERY SERIOUS WE SAW WHAT HAPPENED TO THE CAREERS OF SOME OF OUR COLLEAGUES WE KNOW WHERE THAT HAPPENED AND THAT WE WON'T HAVE CONTROL OVER LEADERSHIP WON'T HAVE CONTROL OVER THAT BECAUSE OF OUR POLICY SAYS. THAT WE WILL RELEASE THAT DETERMINATION IF IT'S FOUND TO BEAT TO HAVE OCCURRED. TO THE MEDIA. SO ALREADY YOU'VE TAKEN. THE ROLE OF LEADERSHIP MAKING THAT DECISION OUT OF THEIR HANDS WE'RE GIVING THAT NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME TO AN INDEPENDENT PANEL TO DECIDE AND THAT'S A HUGE CHANGE. HUGE AND THAT IS WITHOUT. BUT THAT THAT IS -- IT DID YOU KNOW THAT IS -- I THINK. OUT OF IT WILL BE CERTAINLY OUT OF THE HANDS OF THE COLLEAGUES OF THE LEGISLATORS TO MAKE THAT DETERMINATION IT WILL BE UP TO THE PANEL. TO DO THAT BUT BY OUR POLICY THAT WE'VE THAT WE'VE STATED AND WE CANNOT OWE YOU KNOW OVER STATE I THINK THE GRAVITY OF THAT AND I DON'T THINK THAT'S GOING TO BE LOST ON ANY OF OUR COLLEAGUES AND YOU KNOW THAT'S DIFFERENT FOR MAYBE WHAT. HAPPENED I DON'T KNOW I WASN'T HERE. BUT THAT'S THAT'S NEW IS FAR AS I CAN SEE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIRS GOOD JOB YES. TO I THAT'S WHY I THINK IT'S VERY CRITICAL THAT THAT. THAT BY PERSON BODY IS VERY. INDEPENDENT SO THAT. SO THAT WE HAVE -- NON PART THAT'S THE KEY TO THIS WHOLE THING IN MY MIND THE KEY TO THIS IS THAT WE HAVE FAITH. AND TRUST IN THAT PANEL. THAT WHATEVER THE OUTCOME IS IS A IS JUSTICE AT IT IT'S RIGHT SO THAT'S WHY I BROUGHT UP FOR AND I THINK THAT'S THE KEY TO THIS WHOLE THING IS THAT. IF YOU'RE PANEL IS. STRUCTURED IN A WAY WHERE IT IS TRULY NOT THERE'S NO WAY THAT THIS SCALE CAN BE. DONE CAN BE ON THE SCALE IN ANY DIRECTION THAN THAT THAT IT THAT WE'RE GOING TO GET SOMEWHERE I THINK IN A POSITIVE PLACE. AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER RIGHT AYE WE YOU KNOW WILL. LOOK TO CONTINUE TO ADJUST THE LANGUAGE AS WE TAKE THAT POLICY FORWARD ON MONDAY AND SO I THINK IT'S IT'S TWO THINGS -- IT'S THE ISSUE OF ON NON PARTISANSHIP. AND I THINK ALL OF US ARE GOING TO HAVE TO COLLECTIVELY ADDRESS THIS ISSUE ABOUT WHETHER WE CAN BE PROFESSIONALENOUGH THAT HAVE THE CAPACITY. TO FOLLOW THE RECOMMENDATIONS. OF THE PANEL -- AND AND POLICE ARE SELF SENATOR MORE LOCKING LIVING EXAMPLE -- OF WHEN IT WAS INTERNAL EMPLOYEES IF YOU WILL WHO SERVED ON THAT PANEL AND SO I THINK IT'S TWO THINGS THAT WE LEAVE. I WOULD HOPE WILL PUSH BACK -- TO THOSE WHO SAY THEY WANT A TRULY INDEPENDENT AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS. IN A WORKPLACE AND SO. NONPARTISAN I HEAR YOU AND I GET IT I THINK THAT WE HAVE TO ADDRESS BOTH OF THOSE. CONCERNS. I HAVE ABSOLUTELY I AGREE AND I'M ALL THIS JUST TO CLARIFY BECAUSE THERE'S TWO DIFFERENT THINGS THE PANEL DOES ONE IS TO MAKE A DETERMINATION IF THERE'S BEEN A VIOLATION OF POLICY. THAT'S WHAT IF THIS IS SERIOUS -- AND UP SUBSTANTIATED A VIOLATION OF OUR SEXUAL HARASSMENT POLICY THAT'S WHAT WOULD BE RELEASED TO THE PUBLIC. THE RECOMMENDATION IS DIFFERENT THAT YOU KNOW WE ARE NOT ANTICIPATING RELEASING THAT TO THE PUBLIC -- THAT'S WHERE WE DO HAVE TO HAVE THE DISCIPLINE TO TO BE ABLE TO POLICE OURSELVES AND TO MAKE THAT DETERMINATION AS AN EMPLOYER. SO I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THAT POINT. THEN JUST WANT CLARIFICATION IN THAT IS WITH POINT ONE ARE DEALING WITH LOBBYISTS DID DODO WE FEEL COMFORTABLE ENOUGH THAT. IT'S BECAUSE WE CANNOT DISCIPLINE LOBBYIST OTHER THAN. WE KNOW DISCLOSING THAT THEY'VE BEEN INVESTIGATING. UMBER AB ARE YOU COMFORTABLE WITH WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE TO ADDRESS. BECAUSE I WAS CONFUSED AS ASSEMBLY WOMAN REYES WAS THAT. WE WE HAVE. THAT ONE CATEGORY OF LOBBYISTS AND OTHER AND WAS A LITTLE DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND. SURVEY THANK YOU AND THAT'S A A VERY FAIR QUESTION I THINK THAT WE STILL HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO TO DETERMINE. WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE WHEN IT COMES TO ANY MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC I WILL SAY THAT WE HAVE AN AFFIRMATIVE DUTY IF WE HAVE A CO IF WE FIND OUT OF FOR TOLD THAT ONE OF OUR EMPLOYEES IS SUBJECT? TO SEXUAL HARASSMENT OR OTHER TYPES OF OF SERIOUS ABUSE FROM ANY MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC TO PROTECT THEM AND WE CAN'T DO THAT WITHOUT WANTING SOME KIND OF INVESTIGATION. SO IT WE WILL HAVE TO INVESTIGATE THAT SHOULD BE DOING THAT NOW AND I DO THINK THAT IN SOME CASES WE DO DO THAT. WHEN SOMEONE COMPLAINS OF SOMEONE THAT THEY'RE IN CONTACT CONSTANT CONTACT WITH THROUGH THEIR WORK IS AS HARASSED SEXUALLY HARASSING THEM? IN TERMS OF IN TERMS OF THE REST OF OUR POLICY THAT. OTHER CONDUCT TOWARDS OTHERS CLEARLY WE CAN'T EXTEND THAT TO A CONSTITUENT COUNTABLE FIELD. SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO KIND OF FIGURE OUT WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE AND IT WILL PROBABLY BE A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT FOR PEOPLE WHO WERE IN THE BUILDING AT EVERY DAY BECAUSE IT'S THEIR JOB BEING THERE ARE LOBBYISTS. ON AND JUST MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC BUT I WANT TO KNOW IF MY IF ONE OF MY FIELD REPRESENTATIVES. FINDS THAT THEY'RE CONSTANTLY IN A SITUATION THAT THAT THEY THINK IS DANGEROUS ARE UNCOMFORTABLE AND IN IN THAT PERFORMANCE OF THEIR WORK -- WHEN THEY'REOUT IN THE FIELDS I WANT THEM TO HAVE A BEEN PLEASED TO REPORT THAT AND WE NEED TO TAKE SOME ACTION TO PROTECT THEM WHETHER IT'S SAYING THAT WE'RE NOT GOING? TO HAVE A PUBLIC EVENT WITH THAT INDIVIDUAL OR OR WHATEVER IT IS BUT WE HAVE THAT THAT RESPONSIBILITY AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WILL FIGURE OUT AS WE MOVE THIS POLICY FORWARD. OKAY AMERICA FOR THE COLLEGE TIME I'M SORRY SENATOR LEYVA. BE SORRY THIS IS JUST A QUICK COMMENT -- I I JUST I WILL I TO WANT TO THINK AGAIN AND THE CHAIR AND THE VICE CHAIR BUT I THINK THAT SENATOR MITCHELL YOU REALLY HIT THE NAIL ON THE HEAD THIS IS AN HR MATTER. AND WE CAN'T OVER FORGET THAT COMPANIES HAVE HR DEPARTMENTS THAT ARE PAID. FOR BY THAT COMPANY BAND THERE IS REALLY NO WAY FOR US TO BE COMPLETELY INDEPENDENT WHO WOULD THATPERSON BE. I'M INCREDIBLY IMPRESSED WITH THE WORK OF THIS COMMITTEE WE STARTED OUT A LITTLE ROCKY I WASN'T SURE WHERE WE'RE GONNA END UP. BUT THIS IS A BIG SEA CHANGE AND I THINK THAT WE HAVE COME TO SOME REALLY GREAT FOR CONCLUSIONS WE'VE COME TO A POLICY I THINK IS VERY WORKABLE DOABLE. AND IS GOING TO PROTECT EVERYONE WHO WORKS IN THIS BUILDING SO I THINK MOVING FORWARD. IT WILL PLAY ALSO BE A LITTLE ROCKY ONLY BECAUSE IT'S SUCH A BIG SEA CHANGE BUT EVERYONE HAS COME TOGETHER AND WORK VERY HARD ON THIS SO I THINK YOU AND I JUST. HOPE THAT WE ALL REMEMBER WE'RE IN THIS FOR THE RIGHT REASONS WERE IN THIS TO PROTECT THOSE THAT WE WORK WITH. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU AND ACTUALLY AND I DO WANT TO JUST PIGGYBACK ON THAT BECAUSE YOU MENTIONED OUR INTERNAL. ON HR DEPARTMENT WHICH IS UNDER OUR RULES DEPARTMENT WE HAVE EXTREMELYPROFESSIONAL HR PEOPLE IN OUR RULES DEPARTMENTS IN ANY FAILURE THAT THERE HAS BEEN ARE PERCEIVED TO HAS BEEN. IT'S NOT BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE PROFESSIONAL PEOPLE IT'S BECAUSE OUR POLICY WHICH IS A TOP DOWN POLICY HAS ALLOWED FOR THOSE FAILURES. THE SAME INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE IN OUR RULES DEPARTMENT ARE CERTAINLY VERY CAPABLE OF ADMINISTERING THIS POLICY. AND I WOULD LOVE TO SEE MORE PEOPLE LIKE THAT YOU KNOW AS WE CAN TO THE FLESH THIS OUT YOU KNOW WE HAVE THESE GREAT HR PEOPLE I'D LOVE TO SEE. OVER TIME THAT WE HAVE MORE OF THESE PROFESSIONAL HR PEOPLE -- OUT THERE TO SUPPORT OUR STUFF AND I KNOW THAT -- THE PEOPLE THAT WE HAVE ARE GOING TO BE. YOU KNOW ARE VERY FAIR AND HIGHLY TRAINED IN THE CAN CERTAINLY ADMINISTER THE POLICY -- WE HAVE -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER RADIUS. AND FOLLOWED BY DAILY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I I JUST WANT. TO THANK THE COMMITTEE WHO I I THINK WE DID WE'VE JUST TO SENATOR LABOR HAS INDICATED. WHICH IS A GOOD JOB. WE DID START OUT A LITTLE ROCKY BUT I I I THE WORK THAT WE'VE DONE. IN A BIPARTISAN BICAMERAL WAY -- AND I APPRECIAE THE FACT THAT AT THE LAST HEARING YOU HEARD OUR COMMENTS AND YOU INCLUDED THOSE AS POTENTIAL REVISIONS TO THE POLICY THAT HAD ALREADY BEEN PUT INTO TO AFFECT. WE'RE LOOKING TO CHANGE THE CULTURE IN THE CAPITAL. IT TOOK A LONG TIME TO GET TO WHERE WE ARE TODAY AND IT'S GOING TO TAKE A LONG TIME. TO GET IT TO WHERE WE WANT IT TO BE -- AYE BUT I DO APPRECIATE ALL THAT THE TO DONE MADAM CHAIR MADAM VICE CHAIR -- AND ALL OF THE STAFF THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU SO MEMBER DALY SO NO. I JUST WANT TO ASK FOR THE PROCESS FROM HERE FORWARD SO I WON IT SO -- THESE IT WE'VE HAD. I THINK PRETTY MUCH WE HAVE. AGREEMENT ON AT LEAST FOUR OF THE GOOD THINGS THAT WERE LISTED OUT HERE WE HAVE AN AMENDMENT FROM -- SENATOR BATES IN THAT WE HAVE A QUESTION ON THREE OF HOW WE'RE GOING TO DO THE POINT SO WHAT'S THE PROCESS GOING FORWARD. THANK YOU SO THE FIRST STEP AFTER WE'VE MADE OUR COMMENTS AS WE HAVE THE PUBLIC -- AS A PUBLIC IF THEY WOULD LIKE TO TO SPEAK AND THEN WE WILL VOTE TO SEND THE RECOMMENDATIONS ALONG WITH THE CONSIDERATIONS OF THE ISSUES THAT YOU BROUGHT UP. SEND THAT FOR JOINT RULES IS CONSIDERATION ALONG WITH THE AMENDMENT THAT YOU THAT THAT WAS SUBMITTED TO US FOR JOINT RULES -- TO CONSIDER. BECAUSE I THINK YOU'VE SEEN SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT COME UP -- ON HAVE IT JUST COME UP TODAY AND SO WE NEED DO NEED TO HAVE TIME TO MAKE SURE THAT THE LEADERS OF BOTH HOUSES HAVE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO WEIGH IN. ON AND SO I THINK SINCE WE HAVE BEEN MEETING ON MONDAY ALL OF THOSE FACTS ALL OF THOSE ISSUES CAN BE. YOU KNOW WE COULD PUT SOME MEAT ON THOSE BONES AND CAN BE CLARIFIED. ON AS WE PRESENT ON MONDAY SAY. SAY THAT THERE IS A DISCREPANCY BETWEEN THE HOUSES ECAUSE THEY'D THEY OPERATE DIFFERENT SAY THAT ONE HOUSE DECIDES THAT IT'S OKAY THE OTHER HOUSE DOESN'T LIKE IT. WHAT WOULD BE THE PROCESS FOR GOING FORWARD HE PROCESS THAT WE'VE USED UP TO THIS POINT WE CONTINGENT AGO SHEET WE BRING AND -- LEADERS WHICH INCLUDE YOURSELF OF THE MINORITY LEADER FOR THE FAMILY TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON UNTIL WE GET SOME LANGUAGE THAT WE CAN AGREE WITH THAT'S THE PROCESS WE FEW LIES UP TO THIS POINT. AWESOME THAT'S WHAT I WANT BUT I JUST WANNA I WANNA FINISH STRONG TO AND I THINK THAT WE HAVE. VERY MUCH -- WE HAVE COVERED A LOT OF GROUND AND IN THEIR SOME DETAILS THAT I THINK WILL MAKE IT REALLY STRONG AND VERY HELPFUL. FOR NO THE BIGGEST -- CONCERN I HAVE IS THAT THERE ARE STILL EMPLOYEES OUT THERE WHO. DON'T HAVE A PROCESS THAT THEY FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH THAT WE'RE GETTING TOWARDS OUT I KNOW IT. I KNOW IT DOWN YOU KNOW WE HAVE. ALL THE TIME IN THE WORLD TO DO IT RIGHT AND WE HAVE NO TIME TO DO A WRONG BECAUSE THERE'S THERE WAITING ANOTHER SOME OUT THERE THAT ARE WAITING FOR PROCESS THAT IS IS. GOOD AND PROPER AND SO ON IF WE IF WE HAVE THE ABILITY MOVING FORWARD. TO WORK OUT THE FEW THAT I THINK WE HAVE JUST MINOR THINGS AT THIS POINT REALLY I THINK WERE ALL TRYING TO GET TO THE RIGHT PLACE SO I'M EXCITED ABOUT THAT SO WHEN THEY'RE IF THERE. IS A TIME I WOULD BE HAPPY TO MAKE A MOTION OR WHATEVER YOU WOULD LIKE THAT MADAM CHAIR AFTER PUBLIC COMMENT THANK YOU. A SOME MEMBER WALDRON. JUST REALLY BRIEFED BRIEFLY -- THANK YOU SO MUCH TO THE CHAIRS FOR YOUR HARD WORK ON THAT -- THIS WHOLE COMMITTEE REALLY STUCK WITH IT WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT WHERE WE STARTED OFF WITH ALL THE EMOTION AND THE YOU KNOW THE CROWDED MEETINGS AND ALL THE MEDIA AND EVERYTHING ESE THAT WAS GOING ON YOU KNOW TRYING. TO TAKE ALL OF THAT AND FOCUS IT DOWN INTO SOMETHNG THAT IS REALLY. A WORKABLE SOLUTION THAT YOU KNOW WE WILL CONTINUE HAS TO CONTINUE AS THIS YOU KNOW MOVES AHEAD. THINGS WILL SURFACE AND AS WE HEARD EVEN IN THE BEGINNING OF THE WEEK ONE OF THE THINGS WE MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER IS COME BACK AND WE DO THE SURVEY AND YOU KNOW SIX MONTHS OR EIGHT MONTHS OF WHATEVER SO WE CAN SEE. YOU KNOW. WHAT IMPACT IT HAS HAD AT THAT POINT -- IT WILL NO GOING FORWARD IN YOU KNOW THIS COMMITTEE WOULD PROBABLY HAVE TO RECONVENE AGAIN AT SOME POINT AND CONTINUE. TO LOOK AT SOME OF THOSE SO I'M ENCOURAGED BY. WHERE WE'VE GOTTEN TO I'M ENCOURAGED BY? YOU KNOW THE FACT THAT WE COULD ALL PUT IN AND THAT WE CAN STILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON THE FINE POINTS AND MAKE SOMETHING THAT IS REALLY WORKABLE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU YOU PUT PUBLIC COMMENT YES THINK SENATOR MEDICALLY OPEN TO PUBLIC COMMENT I JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT AS AS WE RECALL THE CLIMATE. OF SERVING WE TALK ABOUT I TALK ABOUT THE BELL CURVE AND THE PROMOTER. YOU MISTER DALI FOR OUR STAFFS TO FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH THIS NEW POLICY WE'RE ALL GONNA HAVE TO AGREE TO BE PROMOTERS -- TO TO GO ABOVE AND BEYOND CONGRATULATE EACH OTHER FOR OUR HARD WORK BUT TO TALK TO OUR STAFF -- WE ARE THERE MOST ARE THERE -- CLOSEST CONNECTION TO UNDERSTANDING WHAT IT MEANS TO BE AN EMPLOYEE OF THE LEGISLATURE SO IF WE ALL AGREE TO BE PROMOTERS TO TALK ABOUT OUR CONFIDENCE IN THIS POLICY. THAT WILL GO FAR IN TERMS OF EMPLOYEES FEELING COMFORTABLE TO COME FORWARD BECAUSE THEY'VE HEARD FROM US GOOD WE'VE ALL AGREED TO BE ON THE PROMOTER SIDE OF THAT BELL CURVE. IN TERMS OF MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE NDERSTAND THIS POLICY THE SOUND WE HAVE EVERY CONFIDENCE IN IT IT'S BICAMERAL.

THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY RISE TO THE LEVEL OF CRIMINAL CONDUCT BUT IS NEVERTHELESS HIGHLY INAPPROPRIATE AND DEMANDS A RESPONSE -- DOCTOR DAVID CITED A CASE STUDY FROM DOW HOUSE THE UNIVERSITY IN CANADA -- WHICH IMPLEMENTED A RESTORATIVE JUSTICE RESPONSE TO SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND SEXUAL MISCONDUCT -- THE WOMEN WHO WEAR THE RECIPIENTS OF THE INAPPROPRIATE CONDUCT -- REPORTED A VERY HIGH DEGREE OF SATISFACTION AFTER PARTICIPATING IN IN THESE RESTORATIVE JUSTICE ENCOUNTERS. WE HAVE HEARD REPEATEDLY ON OUR WORK A ABOUT HOW IMPORTANT AND MEANINGFUL IT IS FOR VICTIMS TO HAVE. THEIR HARM AND SUFFERING. VALIDATED AND ACKNOWLEDGED -- BY THE AGGRESSOR AND TO BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE AND AND AND CONSTRUCTING.
