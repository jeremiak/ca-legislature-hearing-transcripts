THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN THANKS FOR ALL OF YOUR WORK AND YOUR COMMITTEES WORK ON ALL OF THESE ISSUES OTHER MAY REVISE REFLECTS THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL OF NINE POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS FOR TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE PACKAGE THIS INCLUDES FOUR POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN PROP ONE EIGHTY BOND FUNDS FOR HIGH SPEED RAIL TWO BILLION GENERAL FUND FORD STATEWIDE TRANSIT AND RAIL PROJECTS AND ONE POINT TWO FIVE BILLION FOR ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION INVESTMENTS ARE I HAPPEN TO BELIEVE THAT INVESTING IN TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE IS A DOWN PAYMENT ON THE FUTURE OF THE STATE. I HITS ALL OF OUR GOALS CLIMATE EQUITY- EVERYDAY QUALITY OF LIFE ISSUES HOUSING- CREATING JOBS SO I AM VERY HAPPY TO SEE THIS KIND OF INVESTMENT. IN OUR FUTURE AND I'M ESPECIALLY EXCITED ABOUT THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS PROPOSED IN THE MAY REVISE FOR ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION AND I LOOK FOR TO NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE ADMINISTRATION SO THAT WE CAN FIND A PATH FORWARD IT SHOULD PACKAGE I WANT TO SAY A FEW THINGS I'D LIKE TO SEE IN THAT PACKAGE AS WE GO FORWARD AND SOME RECOMMENDATIONS FOR US TO CONSIDER AND THE ADMINISTRATION TO CONSIDER FIRST OF ALL I THINK THAT WE DO NEED AND SHOULD EXPECT INCREASED OVERSIGHT OF pTHE HIGH SPEED RAIL PROJECT. AND GUARD RAILS PUT IN PLACE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE STATE FUNDS CAN COULD SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETE A PORTION OF THAT PROJECT THAT IS USEFUL DAY ONE TO THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA- AND I WOULD ALSO. LIKE TO SEE MORE FUNDING MADE AVAILABLE FOR ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION. GIVEN OUR CLIMATE GOALS ARE MOBILITY GOALS AND THE FACT THAT. WE ARE SEEING A CONTINUING INCREASE IN CYCLISTS AND PEDESTRIAN FATALITIES ACROSS THE STATE TO THE POINT WHERE IT IS A SERIOUS PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS. SO I. CAN WE. APPLAUSE MY TIME IF THAT'S OKAY INTO A RESOLVER RINGING PHONE ISSUE. OKAY THANK OKAY NOPE I DON'T KNOW WHAT. THAT WAS A VERY GUILTY KIND OF A- THE RESPONSE- SO- OFF THE HOOK YEAH SO YOU'RE OFF THE HOOK SO- SO YEAH I WOULD LIKE TO SEE. A MORE FUNDING FOR ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION I WOULD SAY THAT ARE ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION- PROJECTS HAVE BEEN OVERSUBSCRIBED FOR THE LAST FEW YEARS WE'VE GOT CITIES ACROSS THE STATE AGENCIES ACROSS THE STATE WHO HAVE PROJECTS THAT ARE SHOVEL READY READY TO GO THAT WILL SAVE LIVES FOR THEIR CONSTITUENTS- BUT THEY ONLY HAVEN'T BEFORE BECAUSE- OF A LACK OF FUNDING. YEAH IT'S FUNNY. OKAY NO PROBLEM SORRY WE'RE JUST TRYING TO DEAL WITH SOME TECH TECHNOLOGICAL ISSUES HERE- I DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THE SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS A SO OF I DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THE SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS PROPOSED FOR INCENTIVE GRANTS TO TRANSIT AND RAIL AGENCIES TO PROVIDE FREE TRANSPORTATION MONTHS AND IT SOUNDS VERY LAUDABLE AND OF COURSE THERE ARE YOUR SOME SPECIFIC POPULATIONS THAT CAN BENEFIT FROM FREE TRANSIT MANY OF THEM ALREADY RECEIVE THAT THROUGH VARIOUS PROGRAMS ACROSS THE STATE HOWEVER. WHEN YOU DO WE DO FOCUS GROUPS WITH TRANSIT RIDERS AND WE ASK THEM WHAT THEY WANT TO SEE FREE TRANSIT IS RARELY EVEN ON THE LIST WHAT TRANSIT RIDERS CONSTANTLY SAY IN THIS IS CONSISTENT ACROSS THE STATE THAT THE FARES ARE NOT A BARRIER TO PEOPLE TAKING TRANSIT. AND IT'S NOT A PRIORITY FOR THOSE RIDERS BUT WHAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO SEE IS MORE- COMPREHENSIVE SERVICE THEY WOULD LIKE TO SEE SERVICE THAT IS AT MORE CONVENIENT TIMES AN EXPANDED TIMES THEY DON'T HAVE TO WAIT THEY WANT TO SEE CLEANER PUBLIC TRANSIT AND THEY CERTAINLY WANT TO SEE SAY FOR PUBLIC TRANSIT SO I WOULD STRONGLY SAID MINISTRATION CONSIDER ALL TRANSIT AGENCIES TO INSTEAD USE THESE FUNDS TO INCREASE THE SERVICE THAT THEY OFFER TO IMPROVE THE SERVICE THAT THEY OFFER- AND MAYBE TARGET FREE TRANSIT JUST CERTAIN POPULATIONS WHO SAY THAT THEY NEED IT. BUT TO ALLOW THEM THE FLEXIBILITY TO USE THAT MONEY TO IMPROVE TRANSIT SO THAT MORE PEOPLE WANT TO USE IT- THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST TO RAISE CONCERNS ABOUT USING GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUNDS FOR PROJECTS THAT WOULD QUALIFY AS CAPITAL OUTLAY UNDER THE STATE APPROPRIATIONS LIMIT INCLUDING HIGH SPEED RAIL TRANSIT PROJECTS AND INCENTIVES FOR HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES I WOULD LIKE TO EXPLORE SWAPPING GIGI R. F. FOR GENERAL FUND FOR TRANSPORTATION CAPITAL OUTLAY PROJECTS AND USED EACH YEAR AFTER CLIMATE RELATED ACTIVITIES FOR THE NON EXCLUDABLE PROJECTS. THIS WOULD REDUCE OVERALL GENERAL FUND SPENDING SUBJECT TO THE STATE APPROPRIATIONS LIMIT AND HELP MEET NEARLY TWO BILLION DOLLAR ABOUT ADDRESS REQUIREMENTS. IN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY TWO AND TWENTY THREE. I'M SHIFTING GEARS TO ANIMALS FOR A MOMENT- HIGHWAYS OR MAJOR BECAUSE OF WILDLIFE DEATH IN CALIFORNIA THERE ARE ALSO A MAJOR CONTRIBUTOR TO THE DECLINE OF WILDLIFE POPULATIONS THAT BECOME ISOLATED BY HABITAT FRAGMENTATION I LOSE CONNECTIVITY THROUGHOUT THEIR RANGE AND THIS OBSTACLES TO WILDLIFE MOVEMENT IS ALSO A MAJOR THREAT TO PUBLIC SAFETY. ON AVERAGE FIVE PEOPLE ARE KILLED AND OVER TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY PEOPLE ARE INJURED IN CALIFORNIA IN REPORTED VIEW WILDLIFE VEHICLE COLLISIONS EVERY YEAR I APPRECIATE THAT THE GOVERNOR IS PROPOSING THAT WE PROVIDE FORTY MILLION DOLLARS TO THE WILDLIFE CONSERVATION BOARD FOR THE FISH PASSAGE WILDLIFE QUARTERS PROGRAM WHEN THE NEED FOR THIS PROGRAM IS TOO GREAT AND I WOULD PROPOSAL WE ALLOCATE AN ADDITIONAL ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR THAT PROGRAM. FOR A TOTAL OF A HUNDRED AND FORTY MILLION DOLLARS THIS YEAR AND MISTER BLOOM I KNOW YOU HAVE BEEN A HUGE CHAMPION OF THIS ISSUE OVER THE YEARS SO I'VE I'M JUST HERE TO SAY LET'S GIVE IT MORE MONEY BECAUSE WE KNOW HOW IMPORTANT IT IS. I WAS I KNOW I'M SPEEDING UP OKAY- IT'S GREAT TO SEE THE ADMINISTRATION AND I'M ALMOST DONE PUT FORTH THE AMBITIOUS SPENDING TO TACKLE THE CLIMATE CRISIS AND SUPPORT CLEAN ENERGY. IT'S MY HOPE THAT WE'RE NOT ONLY MAKING CONSENT OF MONEY AVAILABLE BUT THAT WERE ALSO LEVERAGING THE AVAILABILITY OF INCENTIVES TO CREATE ROBUST POLICY FRAMEWORKS SO THAT CLEAN ENERGY SOLUTION PROVIDERS CAN CONTRIBUTE TO SCALE AND THRIVE WHEN INSTEAD OF MONEY MIGHT NOT BE AVAILABLE IN FUTURE BUDGET YEARS. AND WHILE I SUPPORT INCENTIVES FOR CLEAN DISTRIBUTED ENERGY RESOURCES WE ALSO NEED TO TAKE A HARD LOOK AT HOW TO MAKE SURE THESE RESOURCES CAN PROVIDE RELIABILITY AND VALUE AND SATISFY RELIABILITY CONCERNS THAT WE HEAR FROM THE CALIFORNIA INDEPENDENT SYSTEM OPERATOR SYSTEMS OPERATORS. SOLAR AND STORAGE CREATE THE ABILITY FOR CUSTOMERS TO REDUCE THEIR CARBON FOOTPRINTS. AND TO MEET THEIR CLEAN ENERGY AND RECITE THE RESILIENCY LEADS. ABOUT INCENTIVES ALONE WON'T SCALE THIS DISTRICT WON'T SCALE DISTRIBUTED ENERGY RESOURCES AND WE HAVE TO LEVERAGE THESE RESOURCES PROVIDE VALUE TO THE WHOLE GRID. TO ENSURE THAT CUSTOMERS WHO CAN'T. PARTICIPATE DIRECTLY IN SOLAR CAN ALSO PARTICIPATE IN ALSO BENEFIT AND IN WHAT THEY PROVIDE. AND LASTLY. I SUPPORT TO ALLOCATING TWO HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS IN THIS YEAR'S STATE BUDGET ABOVE ARE ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION BUDGET. TO THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES TO FILL THE MISSION TO CREATE A MAJOR REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION ROUTE. TO CONNECT PEOPLE ALONG THE L. A. RIVER. AND PRETTY AND PROVIDE SAFER CLEANER AND MORE SUSTAINABLE OPTIONS FOR REGION WIDE MOBILITY. THE L. A. RIVER ONES FIFTY ONE MILES TO THE HEART OF LOS ANGELES COUNTY. WITH THE FIRST THIRTY TWO MILES OF ITS COURSE WITHIN THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES. THE ONLY REMAINING SECTION. OF THE L. A. RIVER. THAT IS YET TO BE FULLY FUNDED IS IN THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY WHICH IS HOME TO ALMOST TWO MILLION PEOPLE. WERE APPROXIMATELY THIRTEEN MILES OF PATH REMAIN INCOMPLETE. THIS MAJOR SEGMENT WHEN COMPLETED WILL CREATE A ROUTE THAT WILL ALLOW FOR CAR FREE AND SAFE. MOBILITY FROM CANOGA PARK ALL THE WAY TO LONG BEACH. AND DOZENS OF DESTINATIONS IN BETWEEN. AND FURTHERMORE THE RIVERS PROXIMITY TO CHEAP TO KEEP TRANSIT STATIONS AND MAJOR BUS ROUTES WILL ALLOW USERS OF THIS. L. A. RIVER WAY TO SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCE THE MOBILITY THROUGH THE L. A. METRO SYSTEM AND THEN WE HAVE TRIBUTARIES THAT WILL ALSO OFFER FUTURE SPINE INTERNET CONNECTIVITY. THE MANY NEIGHBORHOODS WE CAN GREEN UP THESE AREAS MANY OF WHICH ARE PART POOR. AND SO I THINK THAT THAT IS A VERY PRUDENT INVESTMENT TO DOUBLE DOWN ON THE HUGE INVESTMENTS OF THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES. HAS ALREADY MADE WITHOUT IT YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE MISTER CHAIR. YOU'RE WELCOME. MISTER BENNETT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THIS IS THE END OF- MY SECOND CYCLE HERE WITH THE OF BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE THREE AND I JUST WANT TO SAY SINCERELY- THIS COMMITTEE CHAIRED BY YOU MISTER BLUMEN AND THE STAFF AS IS GENERALLY EARNED MY RESPECT- IN TERMS OF HANDLING A LOT OF COMPLICATED ISSUES AND THE WAY WE RUN THE MEETINGS AND THEN THE PRESENTATIONS THAT WE'VE MADE I FELT AS A NEW MEMBER JOINING US JOINING A VERY. SMOOTH RUNNING OPERATION SO THANK YOU SINCERELY- I ONLY WANT TO MENTION TWO THINGS ONE THE IMPENDING- PEAK HOUR GRID SHORTAGE THAT- THE GOVERNOR HAS RECENTLY MADE US AWARE OF- I. BELIEVE THAT- YOU KNOW ONE APPROACH TO THAT IS STIFF CONTINUE FOSSIL FUEL- BUT I THINK ANOTHER APPROACH THAT- I HOPE WE CAN MAXIMIZE IS THAT THE MORE STORAGE WE HAVE THE MORE WE CAN STORE THE ENERGY THAT- WE HAVE AN ACCESS DURING NON PEAK HOURS- THE BETTER OFF WE'LL BE DURING THOSE SHORTAGE PERIODS IN THE LAST- FOSSIL FUEL CONSIDERABLE KEEP ONLINE. SO GIVE AN EXAMPLE I HOPE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION. WELL WILL DO SAYING THAT PRIORITIZE PROJECTS THAT HAVE STORAGE FOR EXAMPLE- EVEY CHARGING STATIONS IF WE COULD PRIORITIZE EVEY CHARGING STATIONS THAT ALSO INCLUDES STORAGE IN THEIR PLANNING SO THAT WE COULD COUNT ON THEM TO USE THEIR STORIES AT EIGHT O'CLOCK IN THE EVENING DURING PEAK HOURS AND THEY COULD CHARGE UP THE THERE- THEIR BATTERIES DURING NON PEAK HOURS- THE OTHER THING THAT I WOULD JUST. HOPE THAT WE CAN PRIORITIZE IS- JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT WE KEEP PLANNING AHEAD DURING THE PRESENTATION OF THE GOVERNOR SAID PROPOSAL WE WERE TOLD IT TAKES SIX YEARS ON AVERAGE FOR THESE PROJECTS TO COME ONLINE- AND IF IT TAKES SIX YEARS WE SHOULD MAKE SURE WE'RE PLANNING SIX YEARS OUT- AND THAT MEANS EVERY AGENCY THAT IS INVOLVED NEEDS TO HAVE US AS A STRONG SENSE OF ACCOUNTABILITY TO THAT LONG RANGE PLANNING. AND WITH THOSE TWO THINGS L. RELINQUISH THE REST OF MY TIME THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER. MR FONG. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- MY REVIEW OF THE MAY REVISION- I THINK HIGHLIGHTS THE FACT THAT I THINK THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT MISSED OPPORTUNITIES ON SEVERAL VITAL ISSUES- WHICH RIGHT NOW IN OUR STATE WE'RE AT CRISIS LEVELS CALIFORNIANS ARE FACING THE THIRD YEAR OF A DEVASTATING DROUGHT. THE BONE DRY A DROUGHT CONDITIONS WILL pMAKE OUR ENERGY CRISIS FAR WORSE ROLLING BLACKOUTS ARE A LIKELY POSSIBILITY GAS PRICES ARE OVER SIX DOLLARS PER GALLON- IT WILL INCREASE UNFORTUNATELY ON JULY FIRST BECAUSE OF THE INACTION OF THE LEGISLATURE AND WATER RESERVES ARE DRAINING. THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISION FAILS TO ADEQUATELY ADDRESS THE CRITICAL NEEDS EVERYBODY WILL WHILE BY PREVENTION TO WATER STORAGE TO GAS PRICES- AND THE IMMEDIATE RELIEF THAT'S NECESSARY THERE WHILE BY PREVENTION FUNDING ACTUALLY DECREASED FROM LAST YEAR- WHERE THE BUDGET HAVE ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IT NOW GOES TO SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS THERE'S NO FUNDING FOR ABOVE GROUND WATER STORAGE THIS YEAR. AND THE STATE'S SHARE OF THE DIESEL SALES TAX IS BEING SUSPENDED BUT NO IMMEDIATE GAS TAX RELIEF FOR THE EVERYDAY CALIFORNIA AS CONDITIONS GET GRAMMAR CALIFORNIANS CANNOT AFFORD TO WAIT ANOTHER THREE YEARS FOR WATERS FOR NEW WATER STORAGE AND THEY CERTAINLY CANNOT WAIT OUT ANOTHER WILDFIRE SEASON BEFORE THE STATE COMMITS TO SERIOUS WILDFIRE PREVENTION I RECENTLY WAS IN THE SEQUOIA NATIONAL FOREST 19% OF OUR ICONIC. GIANT SEQUOIAS HAVE BEEN DESTROYED. IF WE DON'T. ACTIVELY STREAMLINED- PREVENTION. ARE WE WILL BE RESPONSIBLE EXISTS AS A STATE FOR ALLOWING ALL OUR GIANT SEQUOIAS TO BE DESTROYED AND TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE EVEN MORE IN THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE IS THE GAS TAX INCREASE GOING INTO EFFECT ON JULY FIRST CALIFORNIANS ARE HURTING AS OUR FINANCIAL HARDSHIPS GROW. THE NEED FOR SUSPENDING THE GAS TAX IS IMMEDIATE AND WITH MORE AND MORE STATES ACROSS THE COUNTRY TAKING ACTION CALIFORNIA IT SHOULD DO THE SAME I WILL ALSO SAY THAT WE NEED TO ALLOW FOR MORE ENERGY PRODUCTION ESPECIALLY IN THE AREAS OF OIL AND NATURAL GAS CALIFORNIA. IS A ENERGY ISLAND. IF OTHER STATES INCREASE THEIR OIL NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION TO SECURE THEIR ENERGY SUPPLY. IT DOES NOT MEAN THAT THAT PRODUCTION WILL COME TO CALIFORNIA WE DON'T HAVE THE PIPELINE INFRASTRUCTURE TRANSPORTATION COSTS MAKE IT ECONOMICALLY- YEAH OUT OF THAT DOESN'T ALLOW IT TO ECONOMICALLY PENCIL OUT. SO WE HAVE TO DO. A PRODUCTION HERE. IN CALIFORNIA THIS HAS TO BE A PRIORITY. AND NOT- AND WHEN WE AS A STATE CANNOT BE PUTTING UP ADDITIONAL ROADBLOCKS. BECAUSE IF WE DON'T ACT. THEN THE FOREIGN RELIANCE. ON ENERGY SUPPLY IN OIL NATURAL GAS AS A STATE IN CALIFORNIA WILL ONLY GO UP. AND I HEAR THIS FROM BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE THAT THEY'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THE FOREIGN RELIANCE ON ENERGY BUT IT'S BECAUSE OF THE POLICIES- AND THE LACK OF INVESTMENT IN ENERGY PRODUCTION IN. IN IN THE OIL AND NATURAL GAS SPACE THAT IS ONLY MAKE THAT WORSE. SO WE HAVE A LESS THAN A MONTH TO PUT TOGETHER A BUDGET THAT PROVIDES REAL SOLUTIONS. HONEST RESPONSES TO THE PROBLEMS FACING CALIFORNIA'S I HOPE THAT THERE WILL BE ADDITIONAL HEARINGS- I HOPE THAT WILL BE A CONFERENCE COMMITTEE THAT WE CAN. HAVE BEFORE THE PUBLIC- AND HAVE THIS AND HAVE MORE DISCUSSIONS ON THIS AT THE LEGISLATURE NEEDS TO CONNECT. AT TO WILDFIRE PREVENTION IT NEEDS TO COMMIT TO INVESTING AND WATER STORAGE NEW AND ADDITIONAL WATER STORAGE NOW. AND GIVING DRIVERS A TAX RELIEF AT THE PUMPS. I THANK. YOU VERY MUCH CHAIR. THANK YOU FOR MUCH ASSEMBLY MEMBER FONG- RIVAS DO YOU HAVE A STATEMENT YOU'D LIKE TO MAKE ON YOUR PRIORITIES. I'M SORRY NO PROBLEM NOW THANK YOU OF YOU KNOW THIS YEAR MY I HAVE FOCUSED ON EXTREME HEAT I JUST CAME IN VERY HOT LOTS OF PARTS OF OUR STATE.

I'M YOU KNOW I'M FROM LOS ANGELES WE HAVE VERY LITTLE- OPEN SPACE AND VERY LITTLE AVAILABLE- LOTS FOR PARKS SO FOR US IT'S NOT AN OPTION WE HAVE TO BE CREATIVE.

TO WORK WITH ALL OF YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SO WILL THAT WE'VE TAKEN TO VOTE AND IF YOU'D LIKE- WE CAN HAVE YOU ADD ON NOW LIKE TO CALL THIS- RIVAS I. AND THE SECOND OPTION RIVAS.

OF THIS SUBCOMMITTEE HAS BEEN TRULY REMARKABLE IN THE BREADTH AND THE- SPECIFICS OF THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS THAT HAVE HAPPENED OVER TEN YEARS.

WE'VE LED THE NATION AND THE WORLD IN ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES WE BUILT NEW LOCAL PARKS AND EXPANDED ACCESS TO OUR STATE PARKS. WITH PROVIDED HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS FOR PLANTING TREES WE'VE APPROPRIATED HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS FOR NATURAL SOLUTIONS TO SEA LEVEL RISE WITH DEDICATED FUNDING FOR REACHING OUR THIRTY BY THIRTY CONSERVATION GOALS AS WELL AS REDUCING IN RESPONDING TO EXTREME HEAT. AND LAST YEAR ALONE WE ADOPTED FIFTEEN BILLION DOLLARS IN CLIMATE INVESTMENTS AND THIS YEAR THE GOVERNMENT GOVERNOR HAS PROPOSED AN ADDITIONAL THIRTY TWO BILLION BRINGING THE TOTAL TO FORTY SEVEN BILLION AS I MENTIONED THIS LIST IS NOT EXHAUSTIVE. ARE THERE ARE MANY MANY MORE PARTICULARLY TRANSPORTATION OF FUNDING- ENERGY FUNDING AND SO MUCH MORE. BUT THERE ARE STILL ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO SAY- WE DON'T- WE DON'T STOP. A OF SOME OF THOSE INCLUDE INVESTMENTS IN OUR AB SIX SEVENTEEN COMMUNITIES THAT ARE HARDEST HIT BY AIR POLLUTION AGRICULTURE INCLUDING HELPING FARMERS TRANSITION TO ORGANIC CROPS INVESTMENTS IN DM SAFETY MORE LOCAL PARKS INCLUDING DISABILITY FEATURES FOR CHILDREN PROTECT CRITICAL BIODIVERSITY AND LAND AND OCEAN CONSERVATION INCLUDING PROTECTING STEEL AT DROUGHT EXPANDING KELP FORESTS CLEANING UP DDT OFF THE COAST AND EXPANDING WILDLIFE CORRIDORS WITH CRITICAL ACQUISITIONS. THERE'S STILL MORE TO BE DONE IN THIS BUDGET.

THANK YOU. A. A PRACTICE HOW LONG DO YOU THINK YOU'RE PRESENT WILL BE MAYBE MINUTES OKAY PERFECT- I BONE- ASK OF SECRETARY CROWFOOT IS ONLY AVAILABLE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS UP UNTIL SO I THINK WE CAN FIT THIS ALL IN I DO WANT TO WELCOME- ASSEMBLY MEMBER MULLIN- DID YOU HAVE A STATEMENT YOU'D LIKE TO MAKE REGARDING YOUR PRIORITIES- VERY GOOD- AND- WE'VE TAKEN TO VOTES WOULD YOU LIKE TO ADD ON AT THIS TIME. MISTER MULLIN. WOULD YOU LIKE THAT WE'VE TAKEN TO VOTES WOULD YOU LIKE TO ADD ON AT THIS TIME THANK. FOR THE FIRST MOTION MULLIN. THE SECOND MOTION MULLIN ZERO THAT MEASURE PASSES IN THE SECOND ONE IS FIVE TO THAT MEASURE ALSO PASSES THANK YOU AND I WILL HEAR FROM THE ELIO GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS RETAILERS WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME- MY COMMENTS WERE BE BRIEF AND HIGH LEVEL WE'RE STILL LOOKING AT THE INDIVIDUAL PROPOSALS HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU AND YOUR STAFF IN THE COMING WEEKS AS YOU DAYS. WEEKS AS YOU WERE MAKING YOUR FINAL DECISION- AS YOU COULD TELL FROM THE TWO DIFFERENT LENGTHS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- PROPOSALS BUT PRESENTATIONS THAT YOU JUST HEARD IT IS A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT STORY WITH TRANSPORTATION AS COMPARED TO RESOURCE AS AN ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION- THERE AREN'T TON OF KIND OF LARGE NEW TRANSPORTATION PROPOSALS INCLUDED IN THE MAIL REVISION- AND THOSE THAT ARE MY WITH TO EARLY OR OTHER OR SO PROPOSALS- AS A NOTED. THERE'S THEM THAT JUST A FIVE MILLION FOR ACTOR TRANSPORTATION THAT IS KIND OF RELATED TO WHAT WAS BEFORE YOU IN JANUARY- THEY QUITE A NUMBER OF POSITION. ROUGHLY A THOUSAND NEW POSITIONS PROPOSED AT CALTRANS WHICH ARE TO IMPLEMENT THAT FEDERAL NEW FEDERAL PRACTICE BACK AND- BROADBAND MIDDLE MILE PACKAGE SO THAT THAT'S PRETTY SIGNIFICANT BUT THOSE ARE PRETTY MAJOR UNDERTAKINGS- MULTI YEAR UNDERTAKING SO THE STATUS IS APPROACHING- THERE ALSO SOME TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE PROPOSED RELATED TO EMPLOYEE. OF THE I. HA WHICH WE WOULD HIGHLIGHT FOR YOU- SOME SOME COMPONENTS OF THAT SAME MINOR SOME SEEM POTENTIALLY A LITTLE BIT MORE SIGNIFICANCE THAT SOMETHING YOU MIGHT WANT TO THINK ABOUT WHETHER YOU WANT A LITTLE MORE TIME. TO CONSIDER THOSE TRAILER BILL PROVISIONS- AND THEN AS NOTED THERE ARE SOME PIECES TIED TO THE GOVERNOR'S LARGER FISCAL RELIEF PACKAGE AS WELL AND BOTH THREE FUNDS THROUGH THE DMV- AND AS WELL AS ADMINISTRATIVE FUNDING FOR THE DMV EIGHTY SEVEN MILLION- ASSOC WITH THAT PROPOSAL AND SEVEN WHO AND FIFTY MILLION FOR TRANSIT SO WITH ALL OF THESE I THINK ARE ARMY MESSAGE ON THAT. IS BECAUSE THEY ARE SO. TO THINK OF THE MAYOR. PER IN CON. OF YOUR TRANSPORTATION. A PACKAGE DECISIONS- AND MAKE SURE THAT THOSE DECISIONS ALIGN WITH EACH OTHER. ON THE RESOURCES SIDE THERE IS A LOT- A LOT OF FUNDING MAJOR INCREASES NEARLY ALL ONE TIME. SOME IS FOCUSED ON IMMEDIATE- PRESSING NEEDS THINGS LIKE DROUGHT WILDFIRES AND POTENTIAL ENERGY SHORTAGES THE THAT WE MAY SEE THIS SUMMER. AND SOME. QUITE A BIT OF IT FOCUSES ON LONGER TERM AT- CHALLENGES AND STATE GOALS LIKE ENERGY- DECARBONISATION AS WELL AS WATER RELIABILITY. SO OVERALL WE THINK THE GOVERNOR'S FOCUSES ON A REASONABLE SET OF ISSUES WE THINK THERE'S MERIT IN FOCUSING ON CLIMATE RELATED CHALLENGES WE THINK THERE'S MERIT IN A- HAVING A MIX OF SHORT AND LONGER TERM ACTIVITIES- AS WELL AS FOCUSING ON ONE TIME RATHER THAN GONE GOING. ACTIVITIES BECAUSE- OF SOME OF THE FUTURE BUDGET UNCERTAINTIES SO JUST A MOMENT ON THAT. IT THE OVERALL APPROACH YOU HAVE BEFORE YOU THIS YEAR IS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT BECAUSE OF THIS NEW EMERGING ISSUE OF THE STATE APPROPRIATIONS LIMIT FOR SAL. CONSTRAINTS ACCORDING TO THE CONSTITUTION IS A NEED TO SPEND A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF FUNDING ON WHAT ARE CONSIDERED SALIX GLUTAMYL ACTIVITIES OR TAX REFUNDS SO AB. ACTIVITIES THAT ARE EXCLUDABLE FROM THAT LIMIT OR THINGS LIKE CAPITAL OUTLAY. AND EMERGENCY SPENDING SO YOU'VE GOT QUITE A BIT OF THAT IN THIS SUB COMMITTEE- BUT THEN THERE ARE ALSO PROPOSALS THAT ARE THAT ARE SUBJECT TO THE LIMIT. I WE WANT TO HIGHLIGHT FOR YOU THAT WE THINK THERE'S ABOUT THREE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS UNADDRESSED SELL REQUIREMENTS IN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED. WE STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU- DO NOT PASS A BUDGET THAT DOESN'T ADDRESS THOSE ROOT. IN PART BECAUSE OF WHAT IT SETTING FOR BUDGET YEAR PLUS ONE. AT TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR WE HAVE SOME CONCERNS AB TO HIGHLIGHT FOR YOU. AND KIND OF TWO PARTS ONE IS RELATED TO THE SOUTH WE SEE PRETTY SIGNIFICANT SALVAR FIREMAN'S INTO THREE TWENTY FOUR ABOUT TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS IS OUR CURRENT ESTIMATE. AND WE'RE NOT FORECASTING THE SIZE OF THE SURPLUS THAT YOU HAVE RIGHT NOW WE'RE ONLY FORECASTING ABOUT A TWO BILLION DOLLAR SURPLUS SO WE THINK YOU MAY FACE A REALLY BIG CHALLENGE AND HOW YOU ADDRESS THOSE REQUIREMENTS IN BUDGET YOUR PLUS ONE. ONE WAY TO DO TO PREPARE FOR THAT IS TO PUT MORE FUNDING AND RESERVES SO TO THE DEGREE YOU CAN LOOK AT YOUR KIND OF NON SALLY EXCLUDABLE ACTIVITIES. AND TRY AND FIND ADDITIONAL FUNDING AND THAT SIDE OF THE BUDGET TO PUT INTO RESERVES WE THINK IT WILL PUT YOU IN A BETTER POSITION- COMING TO BUDGET. PLUS ONE. ALL WORSE SOME PRETTY CONCERNING SIGNS OF A- RECESSION ON THE HORIZON- SO WE ALSO THINK THAT THAT IS YET ANOTHER REASON TO. GIVEN THAT UNCERTAINTY TO TRY AND PUT YOURSELF IN A BETTER POSITION. SO THE STORE ON ON YOUR BY THINKING ABOUT THE EXCLUDABLE ACT AND THEN EXCLUDABLE IS SLOW DIFFERENT- BUT OVERALL WE CONTINUE TO STAY FOCUSED ON YOUR PRIORITIES IN YOUR PRIORITIES MAY BE DIFFERENT THAN THE GOVERNOR'S AS AS WAS EVEN NOTED EARLY AT THE BEGINNING OF THE- YOU MAY WANT TO SPEND MORE ON. WILDLIFE ARE ON WATER STORAGE- AND LESS ON SOME THE GOVERNOR'S PRIORITY SO USED YOU ALWAYS HAVE THAT. TO MAKE THOSE ADJUSTMENTS BOTH ON THE EXCLUDABLE SIDE AS WELL AS THE NON EXCLUDABLE SIDE. SOME OTHER CONSIDERATIONS WITH THAT SUGGEST THINKING ABOUT OUR CAPACITY FOR DE. AND LOCALS TO IMPLEMENT THESE PROGRAMS ESPECIALLY GIVEN LARGE INVESTMENTS RECENTLY- IF THERE ARE NEW. NEW PER. ESPECIALLY ON THE NON X. SIDE THAT ARE PROPOSED ME- HAVE A MUCH HIGHER WE WOULD SEE HAVE A HIGHER FOR CAN. WE TO THOSE ARE NOT SPENT GIVEN THE TRADE OFFS- TIMING HOW QUICKLY DO YOU NEED TO MAKE SOME OF THESE DECISIONS- SPECIAL ON THE TRAILER BILL SIDE BUT BUT ALSO FOR SOME OF THESE LARGE INVESTMENTS- WHAT. DO YOU NEED TO DECIDE THE NEXT FEW WEEKS AND WHAT COULD TAKE EITHER A FEW MONTHS THIS SUMMER OR MAYBE ABOUT DEFERRING SOME DECISIONS UNTIL NEXT YEAR- WE SUGGEST THINKING ABOUT REPORTING LANGUAGE AND EVALUATION ESPECIALLY FOR SOME OF THE NEW PROGRAMS TO MAKE SURE YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT HE WHAT. WE'RE GETTING FROM OUR STATE EXPENDITURES- AND TO INFORM FUTURE INVESTMENTS. AND THEN FINALLY JUST A COMMENT ABOUT THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRIEDMAN- MENTIONED WE DO THINK THERE IS. OPPORTUNITY TO USE G. JEFF AND GENERAL FUND STRATEGICALLY IN PART TO HELP WITH SOME OF THE CELL REQUIREMENTS THINKING ABOUT WHICH ACTIVITIES ARE FUNDED WITH EACH FUND SOURCE SO WE'RE HAPPY TO HELP YOU WITH THAT- WE ALSO THINK THERE IS ADDITIONAL D. G. R. F. AVAILABLE BEYOND WHAT'S IN THE GOVERNOR'S PACKAGE WE THINK THERE'S ABOUT. BASED ON OUR HIGHER REVENUE ESTIMATES ABOUT ANOTHER FIVE HUNDRED MILLION YOU MIGHT HAVE AVAILABLE TO SPEND- ON DISCRETIONARY ACTIVITIES. WITH THAT HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AND SOME OF. MY COLLEAGUES ARE ONLINE AS WELL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OF THE WE PROCEED TO QUESTIONS I HAVE A QUICK STATEMENT I'D LIKE TO MAKE ABOUT. OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS ON THE- CLEAN ENERGY. WELL I AGREE WITH THE GOVERNOR THAT. ACCELERATING ADOPTION OF CLEAN ENERGY. AND PREVENTING DISRUPTIONS ARE AT TOP AND URGENT PRIORITY- OF. ALL CALIFORNIANS DESERVE A CHANCE TO WEIGH IN. ON THE DIFFICULT CHOICES THAT WE FACE. TO MEET THOSE GOALS THIS YEAR. HI HOW HARD EVERYONE'S WORKING TO TRY AND GET THIS DONE. GIVEN THE URGENCY. BUT IT JUST SEEMS TO ME THAT WITHOUT PUBLIC INPUT. I DON'T SEE HOW WE CAN GET IT RIGHT. I'M ONE OF SEVERAL MEMBERS THAT HAVE ASKED THE SPEAKER TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A HEARING ON THIS FALL PER TO CONSIDER IT AS A BUDGET ACTION NOT EASILY THAT HEARING IS NOT TODAY. AND SEEMS UNLIKELY BEFORE JUNE FIFTEENTH BUT I'M HOPEFUL THAT WE WILL GET THE TRAILER BILL IN TIME FOR US TO POSSIBLY CONSIDER ACTIONS. AS EARLY AS BEFORE SUMMER RECESS. NOW WILL MOVE TO MEMBER QUESTIONS. AND JOB OF FIRST LET ME ASK IF ANYONE HAS QUESTIONS RELATED TO DROUGHT- BECAUSE AGAIN US SECRETARY CROWFOOT IS AVAILABLE RIGHT NOW BUT HE NEEDS TO LEAVE BY ELEVEN OTHER. ANY QUESTIONS ON THAT TOPIC MR FONG. THIS IS WE HAVE THE SECRETARY ON- ON THE- ON- ZERO MIGHT HAVE YOU HAVE OTHER QUESTIONS- AND DOESN'T HAVE TO BE LIMITED TO DROUGHT ABSOLUTELY- LET ME JUST CONFIRM SOME NUMBERS FIRST SO THAT IT TO THE L. A. OUT SETTING ASIDE PROP ONE BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND THAT. THAT WAS ALREADY THAT WAS ALREADY IN PLACE. CONNECT THIS UP. BUDGET THAT WE'RE DISCUSSING. HOW MUCH IS IN THIS BUDGET IN THE FOR THE BUDGET YEAR FOR ABOVE GROUND WATER STORAGE- THERE AREN'T ANY SPECIFIC ALLOCATION SPECIFICALLY FOR ABOVE GROUND STORAGE THERE IS FUNDING FOR- SUSTAINABLE GROUNDWATER MANAGEMENT- PROJECTS THAT IS. TAG I'VE WAS IN JANUARY FEELS LIKE A LONG DAY AGO BUT I IT FIFTEEN IF I REMEMBERING MR I CAN HELP. AT TO SPECIFICALLY TO WERE ON BELOW GROUND STORAGE- BUT ARE NO OUT BUT FOR ABOVE GROUND OKAY SO THEN LET ME ASK AS I. A AND THAT'S ONE TWO FIVE TWENTY SIX THE SUCH OF THE BY A MAY RISE I UNDERSTAND THERE IS STOOD WATER. AND OF FIVE AND MILLION. UP CAN YOU. I GUESS TELL ME WHAT THAT. IS YEAH WELL TAKE YOUR MUCH MEMBER FOR THE QUESTION AND APPRECIATE. THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE- AND THANK TERRIBLE FOR. THAT YOU'VE DONE- FOR. NOW TO RESOURCE IN FOR OF THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS YOU KNOW A LOT OF THE WE'VE- CAN DIRECT TO INVEST THAT YOU'VE CHAMPION THE SUBCOMMITTEE CHAMPION. SO THANK YOU I THANK YOU COMMITTEE. OP SO OFTEN WHENEVER FONG JUST WANT TO PROVIDE A LITTLE CONTEXT FOR ALL WHO ARE WATCHING- CALIFORNIA VOTERS PASSED PROPOSITION ONE- WHICH PROVIDES WELL OVER TWO BILLION DOLLARS OF FUNDING. FOR STORY PROJECTS ACROSS THE STATE- WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE TO. CONTINUE TO. IN STORAGE BOTH SMART ABOVEGROUND STORAGE AND THE LOWER STORE WERE CHARGING OUR AQUIFERS. AND SO- THOSE PROP ONE PROJECTS WHICH NOW TOTAL SEVEN PROJECTS. BRIEF SURFACE STORAGE PROJECTS AND FOR UNDERGROUND BURKE PROJECTS- WILL DELIVER TWO POINT SEVEN MILLION ADDITIONAL ACRE FEET OF SO. WHICH IS A CO TO ABOUT TWO AWFUL LAKE RESERVOIRS SIGNIFICANT OF THE SUPPLY. ONE OF THOSE PROJECTS IS OUR SITES RESERVOIR WHICH IS RECEIVED A LOT OF. BECAUSE IT HOLDS GREAT POTENTIAL TO CAPTURE WATER IN WET YEARS FOR USE IN DRIER OP LIKE. LIKE- THE YEAR WERE EXPERIENCE. THE GOOD NEWS IS I'M ON THOSE SEVEN OUR WATER COMMISSION IN OUR AGENCY HAS MADE CLEAR THAT WE'RE FOCUSED ON DOING WHATEVER WE NEED TO DO WITH THAT I THE STATE TO HELP THOSE MOVE FORWARD. GOVERNOR NEWSOM HAS MORE RECENTLY DIRECTED US TO BE EVEN MORE PROACTIVE TO WORKING WITH THOSE SEVEN PROJECTS TO IDENTIFY. HOW ELSE CAN WE ACCELERATE THOSE PROJECTS. GETTING DONE GIVEN CURRENT DROUGHT CONDITIONS. SPECIFICALLY THERE'S DISCUSSION IN THE MAY REVISE OF FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN BUDGET YEAR TWENTY FIVE. TWENTY SIX. OR AUGMENT. OF SUPPLY FOR. I IN THE PROP I SHOULD SAY. SPECIFICALLY ON THE THOSE PROJECTS I IN THE COSTS GIVE IN- INFLATION- WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT THEY THE- COST OR THAT FUNDING IT IS IN HEAVEN TO BILLS PROJECT MOVING TO RIGHT. BUT WE DO THINK THAT BY ON A MILLION DOLLAR IN OUT. I COULD VERY WELL BE HELPFUL AS PROJECTS MOVE TOWARDS FRUITION. THANK YOU TO THE L. A. L. IS THERE ANYTHING IN THE MAYOR VISION THAT YOU CAN SEE THAT ACCELERATES AND THOSE PROJECTS. HOT NOT EXPLICITLY NO OKAY. IN THE WHAT PREVENTION PIECE LET ME JUST CONFIRM THESE NUMBERS- THE LAST LEGISLATURE APPROPRIATED ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS FOR AWHILE FOR PREVENTION- AND THE- CHAMBER. THE GOVERNOR'S JANUARY BUDGET AND I THINK THE MAYOR VISION HAS ONE FOR TWO BILLION OVER YEARS SO THE OF FINANCE- THAT MEANS THERE'S SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR WILDFIRE PREVENTION THIS YEAR THIS CURRENT. BUDGET THAT WE'RE DEBATING- YES THE THIRD RECORD PART OF FINANCE- SO BASICALLY THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL WAS ONE POINT TWO BILLION OVER TO FISCAL YEAR- AND LAST YEAR- THOSE ABOUT ONE POINT FIVE BILLION- WHICH TECHNICALLY WITH OVER TWO FIFTY YEARS BECAUSE- OF IT WITH TWENTY TWENTY ONE. PART ABLE TO ONE TWENTY TWO AND ALSO JUST KIND OF POINT OUT THAT- THEY HAVE MULTI YOUR SPENDING AUTHORITY WITHIN WITHIN THE FUNDING FOR SOME OF IT DOES TAKE. SOME TIME TO SPEND ALL APPROPRIATED SAY WE HAD A PRETTY KIND OF A LARGE AMOUNT OF PROBATE LAST YEAR SOME OF IT WILL TAKE SOME TIME BUT ACKNOWLEDGING THAT WE'RE PUTTING AN ADDITIONAL ONE POINT TWO BILLION. WHICH EQUALS THE TOTAL OF TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION WHEN YOU COMBINE LAST YEAR'S AND THIS YEAR'S INVESTMENT WHICH OF THE PRETTIEST DARKENED SO HOW MUCH IS LEFT TO SPENT. HOW MUCH IS. AWHILE BY PREVENTION I CERTAINLY WANT TO APPLAUD AND- ANNA DOLLARS AT THAT THE- CAL FIGHTER. THAT RESPONSE SIDE I THAT'S IMPORTANT BUT ON THE JUST THE PREVENTION SIDE- HOW MUCH IS NOT. A INSERTED COVERED EACH OF THESE FEDERAL JOB AND IF YOU IF YOU LIKE TO. CAPTURE WE CAN DO YOU THOSE SPECIFIC NUMBERS AND WE'RE GLAD TO REPORT THAT AN UPDATE ON THE SPEND. OF FUNDS APPROPRIATED FOR WILDFIRE RESILIENCY AT LAST YEAR IN THE CURRENT YEAR. I AVAILABLE ONLINE AND WE'RE UPDATING THAT- PERIODICALLY AT THE DIRECTION OF THE LEGISLATURE. HI AND THAT WAS REALLY FOCUSED ON ENSURING ACCOUNTABILITY WHAT WE HEARD FROM THE LEGISLATURE LAST YEAR IS. WE NEED TO GET THESE DOLLARS WORKING AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE TO SCALE UP OUR WILDFIRE RESILIENCE EFFORTS. THAT IS THESE PROACTIVE ACTIONS THAT ARE SUPPORTING. RESPONSE BUT PLACE. BEFORE FIRESTAR. TO GO NEWS IS THINK THE LEDGES TO GO. FIVE HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION WAS OUT. IN EARLY. FUNDING IN LAST APRIL EVEN BEFORE THE BUDGET PROCESS. THAT FUNDING MATERIALIZED OVER FIVE PROJECTS THAT ARE UNDERWAY I HAVE SOME INITIAL PHASE COMPLETED- THAT HAVE MADE A DIFFERENCE EVEN THE LAST WILDFIRE SEASON CERTAINLY IN THIS WILDFIRE SEASON. AND THEN THAT ADDITIONAL EIGHT SOME ODD MILLION. EXCEPT ARE BEGINNING THIS CUT THIS BUDGET YEAR ALSO BEING SPENT- MR LAWRENCE CORRECTED THAT WE ARE REALLY FOCUSED ON BUILDING AND MAINTAINING A PIPELINE- FUNDING. FOR REGIONAL PRIORITIES REGIONAL PROJECTS OR REGIONALLY PRIORITIZE. TO WE HAVE THANKS TO YOU THANKS TO THE GOVERNOR SIGNIFICANTLY SCALED UP THE FUNDING FOR THESE PROJECTS ARE LITERALLY HUNDREDS OF PROJECTS UNDER WAY ACROSS THE STATE. AND OUR PROPOSAL OF A ONE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS THIS YEAR. I WILL CONTINUE THAT TYPE SO WE CAN CONTINUE TO SCALE UP THOSE PROJECTS. OKAY SO I JUST WANTED TO MAKE YOU THROUGHOUT A LOT OF NUMBERS THERE SO I AND I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE IF YOU COULD GET ME THAT THE AMOUNT THAT'S LEFT OVER THAT STILL NEEDS TO BE- ALLOCATOR MOVED PROJECTS AS AS I SAID IN MY OPENING STATEMENT TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE. BUT IN THIS CURRENT BUDGET THAT WE'RE DISCUSSING. THEIR SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ALLOCATED FOR WELFARE PREVENTION. AT TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE YES YES OKAY. BUT I HAVE SOME QUESTIONS ON THE- ON ON THE- ON THE ENERGY SIDE AND ON THE- THE- THE DIESEL SALES TAX SO I DON'T KNOW IF A WOMAN ASKING OUR WAIT TIME TO GET TO THE SIX HOT. I WANT TO MAKE SURE ANYBODY THAT'S QUESTIONS FOR SECRETARIAL CRAWFORD HAS NOT ALTERED SO WE'LL COME BACK TO YOU. MR FONG THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER MISTER BENNETT. THANK THANK YOU VERY MUCH I HAVE ONE QUESTION FOR REST SECRETARY CROWFOOT APPRECIATE YOU. BEING AVAILABLE FOR THIS- WE TALKED EARLIER OF THE SUB COMMITTEE. SOME OF OUR PREVIOUS MEETINGS ABOUT THE NEW NORMAL- IN TERMS OF OUR DROUGHT SITUATION AND ARABIZATION- SITUATION- AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS- I'VE- MENTIONED ONE OF MY COMMENTS WAS TO MAKE SURE WE DO. PROPER PLANNING- FOR ALL OF THE ISSUES THAT- OR COMING FORWARD AS A RESULT OF CLIMATE CHANGE. WE HAVE OF FORTY FOR ME. DOLLARS AGO OF THE REVISED HAS FORTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS ALLOCATED TO THE WATER BOARD. FOR DROUGHT RESILIENCE AND WATER RIGHTS MODERNIZATION. AND WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WAS TO SPECIFICALLY COVER THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A DROUGHT SECTION. AT THE WATER BOARD. THAT SHE- HAS. DEDICATED PERMANENT STAFF. TO BE PLANNING FOR ADVANCED YOU'D DO ADVANCED DROUGHT PLANNING. YEAH THANK YOU I MAY I ASK MY COLLEAGUES CHAIR JOAQUIN ASK ABOUT FROM THE WATER BOARD TO RESPOND TO THAT SPECIFIC QUESTION THANK YOU SOMEONE MEMBER. THANK YOU. SECRETARY AMBIGUOUS ON THE NUMBER- THESE ARE PERMANENT POSITIONS AND THESE POSITIONS WOULD BE FOCUSED ON- DROUGHT PLANNING AMONGST OTHER. ACTIVITIES AND IT THAT WE KNOW WE NEED TO BE DOING AND WATER RIGHTS IN PREPARATION FOR DRY TIMES LIKE THIS SHOULD BE VERY MUCH A SUPPORT CONTINUATION OF THE WORK THE BOARD IS DONE THIS LAST YEAR. WE'RE HISTORICALLY WE ARE- CURTAILING FOR THE FIRST TIME IN CALIFORNIA'S HISTORY LOOKING AT WHAT'S HYDROLOGICALLY AVAILABLE MATCHING THAT UP WHAT WE UNDERSTAND. PRIORITY AREAS ON THE WATER RIGHT SYSTEM AND ACTUALLY ADMINISTERING THE WATER IT'S- SO THESE ARE PERMANENT POSITIONS AND WOULD BE FOCUSED ON ON DRUG ACTIVITIES SO. THAT SHOW GET SAY HERE THAT THERE PER POSITIONS DOESN'T ACTUALLY CREATE A DROUGHT SECTION. AND AT THE WATER BOARD. I THE- WEATHER OR NOT WE'RE OFFICIAL TIMELY TIGHTLY ACROSS. I CAN GET BACK TO YOU ON BUT KNOW THAT THE WORK LOOK AT THE DENTIST AND PAID FOR THEM IT'S SPECIFIC TO DROUGHT ACTIVITIES- THEY WOULD BE HERE. CONTINUE TO UPDATE METHODOLOGIES EVEN IF- AND DURING WHAT TIMES- IN. BECAUSE WE KNOW EVEN THAT IMPORTANT WE NEED TO BE PREPARING FOR WHEN WERE NEVER REALLY GOING TO BE SAME TRUCK CONDITIONS LIKE THE SECOND AND TEN DROUGHT PLANNING THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I THINK IF MEMBER. GREAT THANK A BENNETT THE- BACK TO UNITS FROM. SO JUST A FEW OF FEW- ON THE MEN'S IN THE- IN YOUR REVIEW THAT YOU HAVE- THAT IT W. R. ND ENERGY COMMISSION ARE- THERE'S FUNDING FOR STRATEGIC ASSETS FOR RELY. WHAT ARE THOSE ASSETS. SURE AM I AM THE THREE THINK OUR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SOMEONE TO TURN TO OUR ENERGY COMMISSION COLLEAGUES ON THE MIND OUR D. W. R. TO GIVE A LITTLE BIT MORE DESCRIPTION OF WHAT'S ENTAILED IN THAT. PROPOSAL. YES THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER FOR THE QUESTION- THIS IS A GOOD UP FROM CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION. AND THEY JUST PROVIDE A THAT THAT LITTLE BIT BY. CONTEXT ON. ON WHAT RATE BASING THIS- ASKED AND THEN KIND OF TALK THROUGH. THE DIFFERENT- STRATEGIES WE HAVE IN PLACE. SO AT A VERY HIGH LEVEL- AS THE GOVERNOR KIND OF MENTIONED IN HIS BUDGET BRIEFING. WE ARE ESTIMATING- THE WORST OF THE WORST. ASPECT ASSEMBLY MEMBER BENNETT JUST MENTIONED LOOKING AT THE LONG TERM. OVER THE NEXT FIVE TO SIX YEARS AND UNDERSTANDING. WHAT COULD BE A WORST CASE SCENARIO FOR CALIFORNIA. AND IN IN LOOKING BACK ON TWENTY TWENTY AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE. WE REALLY HAVE COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT. THE RESPONSIBILITY. OFF OF YOU KNOW GETTING THE ENERGY TO. AND KEEPING THE LIGHTS ON. IS BECOMING INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT TO PULL CAL BUT THE TOOLS WE HAVE IN HAND. CLIMATE CHANGE AND DO. CABINETS FIRE AND HEAT IS READY TO COULD. SO CAN I JUST GET I LIKE THAT A GOOD ACTORS I DO. INNER BY DOING A- INTO THAT WHAT ARE THE ASSETS. YEAH I STOOD THERE ARE. BROADLY AT. THREE STRATEGIES THAT THE DEVICE HAS. SAID IN A TALK TO ONE BY ONE SO THE FIRST ONE IS THAT THE W. R. IT'S ABOUT FOUR FOUR POINT TWO BILLION UP FORTY W. R. APPLE OUR THOSE RESOURCE THAT ARE CRITICAL FOR TYERMAN THAT COULD BE HELD ON. IN THIS OUT OF MY- INSURANCE. ARE A SECOND PART OF THE STRATEGIC ASSETS WOULD INCLUDE. BUILDING ARE BRINGING IN MORE SKILLED IN THE GROUND- SIMILAR TO. WHAT THE IDEA OF YOUR HAVE DONE PREVIOUSLY BUT IT'S BEEN PRETTY- BEST GENSETS OR- OUT OF MARKET. AFTER CLEAN ENERGY AT PEOPLE THIRTEEN THAT SO THERE ARE TWO BUCKETS THERE. FOR CC- WE HAVE ABOUT NINE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION. IN IN ENSURING THAT WE HAVE THE WHAT. DISTRIBUTED ACTIVITY BACKUPS- BUT OFFICERS WELL AS I SAID APPLE. TO THE DISTRIBUTED ENERGY BACK ABOUT THAT INCLUDES THREE COMPONENTS. SO ONE WOULD BE. ALL THREE ARE ARE AIMED AT- THEY- ON BACK OF GENERATION IN CALIFORNIA. THAT'S AVAILABLE WHICH IS ABOUT FOURTEEN THOUSAND MEGAWATTS. TO DEPEND ON THEM GETTING GETTING EMERGENCY SITUATIONS SO THE FIRST ONE OF THAT WOULD BE. PROVIDING A MEDICATION EQUIPMENT CLICK I SEE ARE STILL PUT ON EXISTING- GENSETS THAT COULD BE AVAILABLE BY DOING EMERGENCIES AT TWO IT STARTED TO. FUNDING SO PROVIDING INCENTIVES FOR EARLY PLACEMENT OF. A POSSIBLE- BACK GENERATORS BUT BRINGING THEM INTO A CLEAN PORTFOLIO BUT ALSO FUNDING NEW BACK OF GENERATIONS THAT ARE CLEAN. AT FACILITIES THAT ARE STRATEGIC AND NEED. AND THE SECOND ELEMENT OF THAT WOULD BE ON THE SUPPLY SIDE- PUTTING. IN ADDITIONAL GENERATION CLEAN GENERATION EXISTING FACILITIES THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABILITY OPPORTUNITY. BUT ALSO INCREASING THE OVERALL. EFFICIENCY OF THE EXISTING THERMAL. POWER AND TO THINK OUT A LITTLE BIT MORE. AND THE ELEMENT THANKS FOR DEMAND FOR SUPPORT. WHICH OF THE PROVIDE INTENT FOR LARGE SCALE- LOADED UP DOES THE P. THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THAT. IN IN IN TERMS OF THE DIESELS TEXAS- IF YOU'RE GOING TO SPEND THE SALE TAX OF DIESEL IS DEPARTMENT. YOU CAN ASSIST THE STATE'S OF THE DIESEL SELL THAT'S WHY DO THE SUSPENSION FOR AND GASOLINE. ARM SO JACOB KERN A FIVE- THE WE DECIDED GO WITH THE D. SALES. I'M FOR NOT THREE THE FIRST ONE THAT. THE STATE ACTUALLY DOESN'T APPLY A- GENERAL FUND TAX RATE ON THE SALE OF GAS. THERE ARE OTHER SALES TAX RATES THAT APPLY TO GASOLINE SALES BY DUSTIN FOR THE LOCALS AND SO WE DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE THE SAME AMOUNT OF CONTROL OVER- GAS TAX REVENUES FOR GENERAL FUND PURPOSES. AS WE DO PRODUCE OR AVENUES. YEAH OTHER PART OF THE- OKAY WAS BAD. THAT GAP OUR BUT HISTORICAL DIESEL AND GASOLINE PRICE RIGHT NOW IS EXTREMELY HIGH AND THAT'S BECAUSE WE HAVE A LOT OF COUNTRIES THAT USE DIESEL FOR A HIGHER PROPORTION OF THEIR VEHICLES I'M NOT GOING THROUGH A BIT OF A SUPPLY CRUNCH RIGHT NOW AND SO THE GAP BETWEEN GAYS ALL AND- GASOLINE PRICES HAS GROWN TO HISTORICALLY HIGH LEVELS. WE THOUGHT DIESEL NEEDED SOME EXTRA ATTENTION. SPECIALLY GIVEN THE DIRECT IMPACT DIESEL CAN HAVE ALL AND I'M GONNA TO INFLATION BECAUSE DIESELS OBVIOUSLY TO TRANSPORT A LOT OF FRIENDS AROUND- AND SURVEYS THAT IS A BIG CONTRIBUTOR TO THE PRICE OF- CONSUMER GUIDES TO SO THAT'S THE PERFECT SEGUE TO MY OBVIOUS QUESTION WHICH IS IF YOU BACK FAILED. THE SALES TAX- THE DID THE DEAL DIESEL SALES TAX SUSPENSION AND THE FACT THAT GASOLINE ALSO NEEDS TO BE THE PRICE REDUCTION BECAUSE YOUR KNOWLEDGE THEY'RE GOING UP WHY NOT BACK FILL INS IS THE PLACE TO SPEND THE GAS TAX. THE STATE'S GAS TAX- RIGHT NOW WE RETRACTED- ON OUR DOUBTS PROPOSAL TO A GAS TAX REBATE THAT'S INTENDED TO. PROVIDE THE RELIEF FOR. CALIFORNIA DRIVERS MAKING DOUBTS ABOUT OUR AND MORE TARGETED WAY I'M- PROVIDING THAT REALLY WITHOUT- CRICKETING COMPLICATED BUDGET MECHANISMS AFTER THE FACT- OKAY YOU SEE THE IRONY THAT YOU BACK FILLED THE SUSPENSION OF THE DIESEL SALES TAX BECAUSE YOU'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THE PRICE OF DIESEL BOND PRODUCTS INFLATION BUT THEN YOU DON'T USE THE SAME LOGIC FOR GASOLINE WHICH MORE PEOPLE ACTUALLY USE- TO THE STATE. AND THE L. L. ACTUALLY SAYS THAT REDUCING THE FUEL TAXES WILL MOST DIRECTLY TARGET- THOSE AFFECTED BY HIGH GAS PRICES BECAUSE IT'S LINKED TO THE AMOUNT OF CONSUMPTION SO I KNOW THAT'S A RHETORICAL QUESTION BUT I JUST WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT THAT THAT IRONY THANK YOU PROJECT. THANK YOU MR FONG. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS MISTER BENNETT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF THIS IS SAID ABOUT THE SELF GENERATION INCENTIVE PROGRAM- ONE BILLION TO FUND SOLAR AND- AND STORAGE THE PROGRAM IS BRITISH SIGNIFICANTLY OVERSUBSCRIBED AND SO MIKE IS HOW DO WE ARE AT ONE DOLLAR AMOUNT. WHEN SO SUBSCRIBED AND DUBBED THE MIGHT ADD YOU KNOW IT SEEMS THAT WITH THE WITH THE POTENTIAL GRID PROBLEMS WE HAVE COMING UP AGAIN I POINT OUT IT'S SAID THAT THE PROBLEM THAT COULD BE ADDRESSED WITH STORAGE IT'S THE PEAK OUR PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE- AND NOT THE OTHER AND- SO VISIT SEEMS AT HOME STORAGE- HOME SOLAR WITH STORAGE COULD BE AWAY PARTICULARLY IF WE INCENTIVIZE WHATEVER FUNDING WE WERE DOING IF WE TIED THAT TO. PEOPLE WHO A INSTALL STORAGE HELPING AT THAT PEAK HOUR TIME PERIOD WITH THEIR STORAGE THAT SEEMS LIKE A REALLY HELP US- THE PROBLEM AND- NOT HAVE TO KEEP THE AS MUCH- OTHER- OF FOSSIL FUEL THE- BACKUP GENERATION AND- AVAILABLE. SO COULD YOU HELP ME WITH THE HOW DID WE END UP WITH A ONE DOLLAR PLEASE SURE I WOULD POINT TO JUST BUT YOU KNOW THE OVERALL ENERGY PACKAGE AND THERE'S A NUMBER OF COMPONENTS. THAT WE TRY TO ADDRESS AS PART OF THE BROAD ENERGY STRUCTURE AND IT ALSO POINT OUT THAT THIS EIGHT BILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT IN ADDITION TO THE TWO BILLION DOLLARS THAT WAS ALSO PROPOSED A GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. DOESN'T REAL SIZEABLE INVESTMENT AND- THERE ARE AGAIN AND OF PRIORITIES IN THIS A- AND PICKING AND CHOOSING WHAT AREAS TO FOR. ON AND AMOUNTED TO PART OF THE- OVERALL THROUGH. HI TO TAKE BACK THE COMMENTS OF THE INTEREST IN S. S. CHIP. PROGRAMS BUT- AND THEN THE INTEREST IS ADAM- ON SOLAR STORE. AT THIS. SO HAPPY TAKE PICTURES NOT FACT RICHER PARTICULARLY IN THE SHORT RUN I MEAN WE ARE WE THINK WE HAVE A SHORT RUN PROBLEM AND YOU. YOU MAY FIND PEOPLE BE WILLING TO- YOU KNOW FOR A TWO YEAR PERIOD- FOR ASSISTANCE- FOR TO GET THE CREDIT- MAYBE WILL TO. USE THEIR STORAGE TO HELP WITH THE- PEAK HOUR CRUNCH THAT WE HAVE THANK YOU VERY MUCH- AND THEN- THAT. I THINK ALL. OF PLEASE MAKE. AT THAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU S. M.

IT MAY SEEM SENSIBLE TO COMBINE THESE PROGRAMS STREAMLINED THEM AND OFFER ONE STATEWIDE- SOLUTION HOWEVER EACH OF CARBS SEVEN SENTENCE ARE UNIQUE THEY SERVE A UNIQUE AUDIENCE- AND WITH THE EQUITY PROGRAMS AIM TO DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES IS REALLY IMPORTANT THESE BE MANAGED VERY CLOSE TO THE GROUND NEAR THE COMMUNITIES THEY SERVE- IF THE CURRENT FUNDING PROPOSAL IN MAY REVISE IS ENACTED THE TEN MILLION ALLOCATED TO SILICON VALLEY WILL NOT BE SUFFICIENT TO EVEN FIND. THE EXISTING CUSTOMERS IN OUR PIPELINE WITH APPLICATIONS PENDING. UP ONCE WE SERVE THOSE EXISTING CUSTOMERS WOULD BE FORCED TO SHUT DOWN OUR PROGRAM AS EARLY AS THIS DECEMBER- WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THAT- THIS COMMITTEE I CONSIDER. SHIFTING THE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION ALLOCATED TO THE STATEWIDE PROGRAM BACK TO THE FIVE DISTRICTS- AND- PUT THE FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE FIVE DISTRICTS OVER THE STATEWIDE PROGRAM- THIS WILL THEN COVER SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT. OF THE POPULATION THE STATE 90% OF THE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

PIECE OF MIST- IN THE NEED FOR RECYCLED WATER IN THE STATE THERE'S A- TEN TO TWELVE BILLION DOLLAR NEED IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS FOR RECYCLED WATER. AND WE JUST THINK NOW IS THE TIME TO INVEST IN CREATING NEW WATER SUPPLIES AMMAR AGENCIES ARE DOING A GREAT JOB OF CONSERVING BUT CREATING NEW WATER SUPPLIES. TO REDUCE RELIANCE ON IMPORTED WATER- CAN ONLY COME FROM RECYCLED WATER SO WE ENCOURAGE ENCOURAGE AN INCREASE INVESTMENT FOR. RECYCLED WTER TO THE STATE BOARD.
