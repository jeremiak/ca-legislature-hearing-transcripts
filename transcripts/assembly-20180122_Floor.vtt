READS.

00:49:48.886 --> 00:49:52.389 region:rollup2
IT IS LIKELY A RESULT THAT

00:49:50.454 --> 00:49:54.024 region:rollup2
NUMEROUS LAWSUITS ADMINISTRATORS

00:49:52.389 --> 00:49:55.526 region:rollup2

WHILE RESTRICTING OTHERS

00:49:58.796 --> 00:50:03.434 region:rollup2
FOR EXAMPLE.

00:50:01.632 --> 00:50:05.503 region:rollup2
MANY AMERICANS MAY REGARD A

00:50:03.434 --> 00:50:07.938 region:rollup2
CONFEDERATE FLAG AS A SYMBOL OF

00:50:05.503 --> 00:50:10.040 region:rollup2
RACISM. WHILE OTHERS MAY VIEW IT

00:50:07.938 --> 00:50:12.309 region:rollup2
AS A SYMBOL OF SOUTHERN HERITAGE

00:50:10.040 --> 00:50:14.178 region:rollup2
AND MAY ABUSE THIS LAW IN ORDER

00:50:12.309 --> 00:50:16.247 region:rollup2
TO ENCOURAGE THAT OR MORE

00:50:14.178 --> 00:50:17.915 region:rollup2

00:50:17.915 --> 00:50:21.352 region:rollup2
WELL THAT MAY BE CULTURAL TO

00:50:19.350 --> 00:50:22.720 region:rollup2
SOME MAY NOT BE OFFENSIVE TO

00:50:21.352 --> 00:50:24.355 region:rollup2
OTHERS AND WILL DISTRACT FROM

SEVENTY THREE TO ONE A LEADER TO

00:51:05.829 --> 00:51:09.600 region:rollup2
GUESS WHO THE ONE WAS. A WHO

00:51:06.730 --> 00:51:11.402 region:rollup2
VOTED OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL.

00:51:09.600 --> 00:51:12.836 region:rollup2
IT WAS STATED THAT THIS BILL

00:51:11.402 --> 00:51:13.737 region:rollup2
DOES IS AYE IS REDUNDANT TO

00:51:12.836 --> 00:51:15.439 region:rollup2
EXISTING LAW.

00:51:13.737 --> 00:51:17.241 region:rollup2
BUT I WOULD TELL YOU THAT YOU

00:51:15.439 --> 00:51:17.775 region:rollup2
SHOULD ASK THE STUDENTS FROM

00:51:17.241 --> 00:51:19.143 region:rollup2
PECHANGA.

00:51:17.775 --> 00:51:20.344 region:rollup2
IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WHO

00:51:19.143 --> 00:51:21.612 region:rollup2

WEAR EAGLE FEATHERS AT THEIR

00:51:21.612 --> 00:51:24.915 region:rollup2
GRADUATION ASK THEM IF THE LAW

00:51:23.180 --> 00:51:26.116 region:rollup2
IS CLEAR ABOUT THEIR ABILITY TO

00:51:24.915 --> 00:51:27.518 region:rollup2
WEAR CULTURAL ADORNMENTS AT

00:51:26.116 --> 00:51:28.986 region:rollup2
GRADUATION CEREMONIES ASKED THE

00:51:27.518 --> 00:51:30.988 region:rollup2
YOUNG MAN JUST DOWN THE ROAD EL

00:51:28.986 --> 00:51:32.556 region:rollup2
GROWTH. WHO'S DENIED CULTURAL A

00:51:30.988 --> 00:51:34.091 region:rollup2
IT WOULD THE ABILITY TO WEAR HIS

00:51:32.556 --> 00:51:35.793 region:rollup2
CAN TAKE OFF AT HIS GRADUATION

00:51:34.091 --> 00:51:37.161 region:rollup2
CEREMONY I HAVE THE UTMOST

00:51:35.793 --> 00:51:38.395 region:rollup2
RESPECT FOR OUR GOVERNOR BUT THE

00:51:37.161 --> 00:51:39.563 region:rollup2
TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS THIS IS A

00:51:38.395 --> 00:51:41.365 region:rollup2
PROBLEM THAT IS INVOLVED IN

00:51:39.563 --> 00:51:42.800 region:rollup2
EVERY ONE OF OUR SCHOOLS. THIS

00:51:41.365 --> 00:51:44.735 region:rollup2
HAPPENS REGULARLY AND IT

00:51:42.800 --> 00:51:46.337 region:rollup2
DESERVES CLARIFICATION BY THIS

00:51:44.735 --> 00:51:48.339 region:rollup2
BODY THAT THE STUDENTS ARE

00:51:46.337 --> 00:51:49.707 region:rollup2
ENTITLED TO FREE EXPRESSION WITH

00:51:48.339 --> 00:51:51.408 region:rollup2
THE CAVIAR OF NOT BEING

00:51:49.707 --> 00:51:52.242 region:rollup2
DISRUPTIVE AND I WOULD SIMPLY

00:51:51.408 --> 00:51:54.678 region:rollup2
SAY THIS IS ABOUT CULTURAL

00:51:52.242 --> 00:51:55.512 region:rollup2
ADORNMENTS THIS IS NOT ABOUT

00:51:54.678 --> 00:51:57.047 region:rollup2
POLITICAL.

00:51:55.512 --> 00:51:59.583 region:rollup2
OR OTHER THERE IS A REFERENCE

00:51:57.047 --> 00:52:01.885 region:rollup2
TO CONFEDERATE FLAG FOR WHICH I

00:51:59.583 --> 00:52:03.587 region:rollup2
DON'T BELIEVE I CAN TAKE CLOTH

00:52:01.885 --> 00:52:05.889 region:rollup2
AN EAGLE FEATHER.

00:52:03.587 --> 00:52:08.892 region:rollup2
IOMEGA ANY THESE OTHER THINGS

00:52:05.889 --> 00:52:09.994 region:rollup2
THAT WE SEE CURRENTLY IN SO MANY

00:52:08.892 --> 00:52:10.995 region:rollup2

00:52:10.995 --> 00:52:14.898 region:rollup2
WOULD NOT BE WOULD WE BE

00:52:12.796 --> 00:52:17.534 region:rollup2
PERMITTED IT WOULD NOT BE

00:52:14.898 --> 00:52:19.570 region:rollup2
PERMITTED THE IDEA IS TO CLARIFY

00:52:17.534 --> 00:52:21.405 region:rollup2
THE LAW TO ALLOW STUDENTS TO

00:52:19.570 --> 00:52:24.108 region:rollup2
ENJOY THEIR GRADUATION

00:52:21.405 --> 00:52:25.142 region:rollup2
CEREMONIES WITHOUT LITIGATION I

00:52:24.108 --> 00:52:28.312 region:rollup2
