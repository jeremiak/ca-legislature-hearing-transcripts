THERE WILL BE NO VOTE IN THE COMMITTEE TODAY. TODAY'S HEARING WILL FOCUS ON THE RECENT REPORT FROM THE INSPECTOR GENERAL REGARDINGCDC OURS NEWS THAT COMPLAIN PROCESS. WILL ALSO BE GETTING A RESPONSE- DEPARTMENT AND DISCUSS THE REMAINING BUDGET PROPOSAL THEY HAVE SUBMITTED. IN RECENT HISTORY THIS SUBCOMMITTEE HAS HAD MULTIPLE HEARINGS REGARDING CDCR STAFF COMPLAIN PROCESS. THE DEPARTMENT ADOPTED A NEW PROCESS LAST YEAR AFTER HEARING CONCERNS FROM LEGISLATORS AND ATTORNEYS REPRESENTING CAR THIRTY PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES REGARDING BIAS. QUALITY CONTROL AND OVERALL FAIRNESS OF THE PROCESSES. BASED ON THE DATA AND FINDINGS IN THE REPORT FROM THE INSPECTOR GENERAL THOSE CONCERNS STILL REMAIN. WELL WE CAN WORK TOGETHER TO FIGURE OUT WHAT A FAIR INDEPENDENT PROCESS LOOKS LIKE BOTH TO THE ACCUSER AND THE ACCUSED THE QUESTION OF HOW TO DEAL WITH PERVASIVE VIOLENT. AND OFTEN THE HUMANIZING CULTURE THE PRESIDENT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT FITS EASILY INTO LET'S SAY THE SOLUTION. WHAT WE CAN DO IS PROMOTED AS SAFER ENVIRONMENT THAT PROMOTES REHABILITATION WHICH WE KNOW SAFER FOR STAFF. AND SO THAT WHEN PEOPLE ARE RELEASED FROM PRISON THEY LEAVE BETTER NOT WORSE. THEY SHOULD BE FOR US CREATE SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL LIABILITY FOR THE STATE BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY IT HAS DEEP CIVIL AND HUMAN RIGHTS IMPLICATIONS. THANK YOU ALL THE PANELISTS FOR A DREAM TO BE HERE TODAY AND I LOOK FORWARD TO TODAY'S DISCUSSION. AFTER EACH PANEL I WILL OPEN IT UP FOR SUBCOMMITTEE MEMBERS QUESTIONS. OUR FIRST ISSUE TODAY'S A SPECIAL REVIEW OF THE STATUS CONTACT PRESS PROCESS AND WE HAVE- OFF ON THE ARM FROM FOR COMPLIANCE BUDGET PROPOSAL. FOR THOSE WHO ARE PRESENTING AT COULD PLEASE- GIVE YOUR NAME WHEN YOU START SPEAK. LET'S BEGIN. CONCERT WITH CAITLIN. WE CAN'T HEAR YOU CAITLYN. NO NO FEDERAL MEDICARE F. CAITLYN. TWO TWENTY HELLO THIS IS THIS IS CAITLIN O'NEILL WITH THE L. A. O. WE HEAR YOU NOW OKAY GREAT. I'LL GO AHEAD AND GET STARTED. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR IT IS KILLING GALLAGHER L. A. O. FOR THE RECORD AT THE VERY STILL IN THE PROCESS OF ANALYZING THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IN THE CONTEXT OF INSPECTOR GENERAL'S REPORT THAT- WHICH RECENTLY CAME OUT. BUT AT THIS POINT WE'D LIKE TO PROVIDE THREE PIECES OF BACKGROUND INFORMATION FOR MEMBERS AWARENESS FIRST- REPORTS OF SERIOUS OFFICER MISCONDUCT ARE NOT NEW AND HAVE BEEN REPORTED AT SEVERAL PRISONS BY MULTIPLE REPUTABLE SOURCES INCLUDING INSPECTOR GENERAL COURT EXPERTS ANY EASIER ON STAFF. FOR EXAMPLE AFTER VISITING- RICHARD J. DONOVAN CORRECTIONAL FACILITY IN SAN DIEGO IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN AS A PART OF A STRIKE TEAM SENT BY CDCR TO INTERVIEW INMATES- REGARDING THE ALLEGATIONS OF MISCONDUCT. THE SHERIFF CHIEF OMBUDSMAN ROPE TO CDCR LEADERSHIP EXPRESSING GRAVE CONCERN URGING MEDIA RESPONSE AND NOTING THAT THE ALLEGATIONS. WERE THE WORST SHE HEARD IN HER CAREER. SECOND CAN ABOUT CDC- THE BILLING TO HAND STAFF MISCONDUCT ARE ALSO NEW. AND HAVE ALSO BEEN RAISED BY MULTIPLE REPUTABLE STAKEHOLDERS AT SOURCES IN ADDITION TO THE INSPECTOR GENERAL WHO YOU'LL HEAR FROM AFTER ME ON THE PANEL TODAY. FOR EXAMPLE IN A REPORT TO CDC OUR LEADERSHIP IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE- STRIKE TEAM THAT WENT TO RJD. CONCLUDED THAT QUOTE IN THE ALLEGATIONS TAKEN AS A WHOLE SEEM TO DESCRIBE AN ENVIRONMENT WITH NO RELIEF MECHANISM FOR INMATES WHO FEEL MISTREATED BY CUSTODY STAFF. MOREOVER AN EXPERT WITNESS IN THE ARMSTRONG VERSUS NATION CASE WHICH I'LL TALK ABOUT IN A MOMENT- WHO HAD WRITTEN THE USE OF FORCE AND DISCIPLINE SYSTEMS- IN JAILS AND PRISONS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. STATED IN COURT DECLARATION THAT CDCR SYSTEM IS THE WORST HE'S SEEN IN HIS CAREER. I'M MOREOVER IT CDCR APPEARS TO HAVE DISREGARDED CONCERNS RAISED BY THIS COMMITTEE AND THE INSPECTOR GENERAL. IN THE COURSE OF PROMULGATING REGULATIONS FOR THE NEW ORLEANS PROCESS WHICH COMPOUNDS UPON THAT. CONCERNS ABOUT CITIES HERE'S ABILITY TO HANDLE STAFF MISCONDUCT ISSUES. AND THIRD THIRD IT IS INVOLVED IN ONGOING LITIGATION ON BOTH THE ALLEGATIONS THERE IS OFTEN MISCONDUCT AND THE STATE'S ABILITY TO HANDLE IT APPROPRIATE. SEVEN MILLION IN FEBRUARY TWENTY PLAINTIFFS IN ARMSTRONG VERSUS NEW SANDWICH IS AN ONGOING CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT RELATED TO TREATMENT OF INMATES WITH DISABILITIES- ALLEGE THAT OFFICERS AT RJD ARE ASSAULTING A CONFUSING AND RETALIATING AGAINST INMATES WITH DISABILITIES- AND THAT THE PRISON SYSTEM FOR RESPONDING TO THESE ALLEGATIONS IS AN ADEQUATE. IN SEPTEMBER THE COURTS ORDERED CDCR TO DEVELOP A PLAN TO ADDRESS THESE CONCERNS THAT RJD AND REQUIRED THE PLAN INCLUDES CERTAIN ELEMENTS SUCH AS BODY WORN CAMERAS- WHICH IS. WHICH LED INTO THE P. C. P. WILL BE TO START HEARING ABOUT LATER- AND FINALLY IN JUNE PLAINTIFFS IN THAT LAWSUIT FILED A MOTION ALLEGING THAT THIS MISCONDUCT AND INADEQUATE SYSTEMS FOR HANDLING IT. IS SYSTEMIC AND REQUESTING STATEWIDE RELIEF HOWEVER THE COURT IS STILL CONSIDERING THIS THIS MOTION. THANK YOU AND I'M HAPPY TO TAKE COMMENT HAVE QUESTIONS AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. SIX OF THE PARTICULAR AT THE END WE'RE GOING TO GO NEXT TO OUR INSPECTOR GENERAL AND THE- MISTER WESLEY IF YOU COULD JUST START SPEAKING SHOULD COME ON SCREEN POINT YOU START SPEAKING. THANK YOU AND GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS HI I'M ROY WESLEY THE CALIFORNIA INSPECTOR GENERAL. THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME HERE TODAY TO BRIEF YOU ON THE O. I. G. REVIEW OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION PROCESS. FOR REVIEWING AND INVESTIGATING INCARCERATED PERSONS ALLEGATIONS OF STAFF MISCONDUCT AND THE FORMATION OF THE NEW UNIT TO HANDLE SUCH ALLEGATIONS CALLED. THE ALLEGATION ENQUIRY MANAGEMENT SECTION. I WILL FOCUS TODAY ON A TOP LEVEL OVERVIEW. THE PROCESS WE LOOKED AT CAME ABOUT AS A RESULT OF A REVIEW MY OFFICE COMPLETED IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN AT SALINAS VALLEY STATE PRISON. AT THE TIME WE WERE ASKED BY THE DEPARTMENT AND THE PRISON LAW OFFICE TO LOOK AT HOW THESE GRIEVANCES WERE PROCESSED AT SALINAS VALLEY STATE PRISON. WE FOUND A SYSTEM THAT WAS UTTERLY AND COMPLETELY BROKEN. THE INCREASE CONDUCTED AT SALINAS VALLEY WERE RIFE WITH BOTCHED INTERVIEWS OFFICER BIAS AND NO SEMBLANCE OF FAIRNESS. AS A RESULT OF THAT REVIEW. WE MADE A NUMBER OF RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE DEPARTMENT INCLUDING REMOVING THE WARDENS AND INSTITUTION STAFF FROM THIS PROCESS. REGIONALIZED THE PROCESS JUST AS THE OFFICE OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS HAS REGIONALI STATES MISCONDUCT INVESTIGATIONS. USE TRAINED INVESTIGATORS TO COMPLETE THESE ENCOURAGED AND CREATE AN AUDIT FUNCTION TO ENSURE DISCIPLINARY ACTION RESULTING FROM INQUIRIES WERE ACTUALLY APPLIED. THE REPORT WE WROTE IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN LED TO THIS COMMITTEE HOLDING A HEARING ON THIS ISSUE ALMOST EXACTLY TWO YEARS AGO. ALLOW ME TO PROVIDE YOU WITH THE DEPARTMENT'S RESPONSE TO THESE ISSUES DURING THE HEARING IN THEIR OWN WORDS. THE DEPARTMENT PROFESS TO AGREE WITH THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT MY OFFICE MADE IN THE REPORT. SINCE WE DO AGREE THAT THE STAFF COMPLAINT PROCESS DOES NEED TO BE REMOVED FROM THE PRISON ITSELF. WE DO NEED TO HAVE- THE INVESTIGATORS- THE TRAIN THE STAFF SO THEY CAN DO INDEPENDENT INQUIRIES ON THEIR OWN OUTSIDE OF THE PRISON SETTING. I WOULD PERMIT REPRESENTED THAT THE INCREASE WOULD BE REMOVED. TAX COURT. THE INCREASE WOULD BE REMOVED FROM THE INSTITUTIONS AND THAT WARDENS WOULD BE OUT OF THE PROCESS CLICK HERE. FIVE COULD IT. BUT IF WE'RE GONNA BE LOOKING AT ADDING RESOURCES WE HAVE TO HAVE A LOT OF CONFIDENCE THAT THOSE RESOURCES ARE GONNA HAVE A FACT THAT HAVE AFFECTED NOW AND LEAD INTO THE RECEIPT OF THE CONVERSATION THAT THAT WERE THAT WERE ALSO HAVING. AND REALLY HAPPY HAVE THE IMPACT OF REHABILITATION THAT WE HELP THE PRISON SYSTEMS. ARE AND REALLY CAMBY. I AGREE WITH I AGREE WITH THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER I THINK- SO FINALLY THE DEPARTMENT NOTED THAT THE PROCESS HAD BEEN REMOVED FROM THE DIVISION OF ADULT INSTITUTIONS CLIPS. THIS SITUATION YOU AND SORT OF ALLUDED THAT YOU CHANGED SOME POLICIES CAN YOU WALK US THROUGH THOSE POLICY CHANGES AND IF YOU CAN SHARE HOW THOSE WERE IMPLEMENTED WITH THOSE DONE IN A IN ORDER AND A MEMO WOULD LIKE TO SEE A COPY OF THAT AS WELL WE CAN GET YOU SOME OF THOSE DOCUMENTS BUT I THINK ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHANGES LIKE I SAID EARLIER. WAS MOVING THE STAFF COMPLAINT PROCESS OUTSIDE OF THE PRISON AND PUTTING IT UNDER OUR OFFICE OF OVERSIGHT AND RESEARCH AND ACCOUNTABILITY AND THAT'S REALLY THAT'S UNDER THE UMBRELLA OF WORLD- THE JOURNAL AFFAIRS EXISTS. SO IT'S UP. UNFORTUNATELY AS A REPORT DOCUMENTS THESE PROMISES WERE NOT FULFILLED. BY THE CONCLUSION OF THAT HEARING I WOULD LIKE TO LEAVE YOU WITH THREE BROAD POINTS. NUMBER ONE. WARDENS UNDERMINE THE PURPOSE OF AIMS BY NOT REFERRING CASES AND KEEPING INCREASE WITHIN THE INSTITUTION. NUMBER TO THAT DEPARTMENT HAS LIKELY GROSSLY UNDERCOUNTED THE ACTUAL NUMBER OF ALLEGATIONS OF STAFF MISCONDUCT. WHEN WARDEN SIMPLY RE CATEGORIZE COMPLAINTS FROM ALLEGATIONS OF STAFF MISCONDUCT TO ROUTINE APPEALS. AND FINALLY WARDENS RARELY FOUND MERIT IN THE ALLEGATIONS THEY RESOLVED ESSENTIALLY EXONERATING THEIR STAFF MORE THAN 98% OF THE TIME. IN A 200-019-2000 TWENTY BUDGET THE DEPARTMENT REQUESTED FORTY SEVEN POSITIONS AT NINE POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS NON GOING FUNDING. THAT REQUEST WAS GRANTED AND THE DEPARTMENT STOOD UP THE ALLEGATION ENQUIRY MANAGEMENT SECTION TO INVESTIGATE INCARCERATED PERSONS ALLEGATIONS OF STAFF MISCONDUCT. IN THEIR REQUEST FOR FUNDING THE DEPARTMENT PROMISED THAT THIS NEW UNIT WOULD PERFORM FOUR HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FOUR INCREASE PER MONTH. EQUALING FIVE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND NINETY INCREASE PER YEAR. WE REVIEWED THE ACTIVITIES OF AIMS FOR THE FIVE MONTH PERIOD FROM APRIL FIRST TWO THOUSAND TWENTY THROUGH AUGUST THIRTY FIRST TWO THOUSAND TWENTY. I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT THIS WAS A PERIOD WHEN AIMS WAS FULLY FUNCTIONAL. DURING THIS FIVE MONTH PERIOD THE UNIT ACCEPTED FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY EIGHT ENQUIRIES FOR ABOUT ONE FIFTH OF WHAT IT WAS SUPPOSED TO HANDLE. IN FACT WARDENS DETERMINED TWO THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED THIRTY NINE GRIEVANCES DURING THIS PERIOD ALLEGED STAFF MISCONDUCT. ACCORDING TO ITS OWN ANALYSIS WHEN REQUESTING THE BUDGET AUGMENTATION FOR AIMS. THE UNIT COULD HAVE HANDLED ALL OF THESE ALLEGATIONS. IF AIMS HAD FULFILLED ITS PROMISE IN THE NUMBER OF INCREASE THAT WOULD HANDLE THE ANNUALIZED COST PER ENQUIRY WOULD BE APPROXIMATELY ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS. BASED ON THE WORK THEY ACTUALLY DID THE ANNUALIZED COST PER ENQUIRY IT'S APROXIMATELY NINE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED SIXTY ONE DOLLARS PER. IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN THE DEPARTMENT ASSERTED THAT THE WARDENS AND INSTITUTIONS WORK OUT OF THIS PROCESS HOWEVER. UNDER THE DEPARTMENT'S REGULATIONS THAT THEY DEVELOPED AS A RESULT OF OUR TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN REPORT. WARDEN'S REMAINS CENTRAL TO THIS PROCESS WARDENS OR THEIR CHIEFS REVIEW EVERY CLAIM THAT POTENTIALLY CLAIMS CONTAINS ALLEGATIONS OF STAFF MISCONDUCT FILED BY INCARCERATED PERSONS. AND DETERMINE WHETHER THE CLAIM MEETS THE DEPARTMENT'S DEFINITION OF STAFF MISCONDUCT AND WHETHER IT WILL BE REFERRED OUTSIDE THE PRISON. NOTHING GETS REFERRED AIMS FOR INQUIRY WITHOUT A WORD AND MAKING THE REFER. AS I SAID CONTRARY TO WHAT WAS INSERTED AT THE HEARING BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE ALMOST TWO YEARS AGO WARDENS AND THE INSTITUTIONS ARE MOST ASSUREDLY NOT OUT OF THIS PROCESS. AS I NOTED EARLIER WARDENS IDENTIFIED TWO THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY NINE GRIEVANCES AT STAFF MISCONDUCT DURING OUR REVIEW PERIOD. HOWEVER THE ONLY REFERRED 23% OF THOSE CASES TO AIMS. THEY HANDLE THE BALANCE OF THE 77% OF THE CASES INTERNALLY AT THE PRISONS. IN ADDITION WE HAVE UNCOVERED EVIDENCE THAT THE TWO THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY NINE GRIEVANCES IDENTIFIED BY WORDS OF STAFF MISCONDUCT. IS GROSSLY UNDERCOUNTED. WE SUSPECT THAT INCARCERATED PERSONS FILED THOUSANDS MORE ALLEGATIONS OF STAFF MISCONDUCT IN THE DEPARTMENT SYSTEMS SHOW. UNDER THE DEPARTMENT OF THE PROCESS THE DEVELOPED BY THE DEPARTMENT AGREEMENTS IS FIRST REVIEWED BY A GRIEVANCE COORDINATOR. WHO REFUSED TO SEE IF THERE IS AN ALLEGATION OF STAFF MISCONDUCT. AFTER THAT REVIEW THE GRIEVANCE GOES FOR FINAL REVIEW BY THE WORK. WITH HER OR NOT WITH THE GRIEVANCE COORDINATOR THAT THE GRIEVANCE ALLEGES STAFF MISCONDUCT. WARDENS COUNTERMANDED THEIR GRIEVANCE COORDINATOR 65% OF THE TIME. AND FOUND ONLY 35% OF THE GRIEVANCE GRIEVANCES FORWARDED TO THEM ALLEGED STAFF MISCONDUCT. THE GRIEVANCE THAT WERE NOT FOUND TO BE STAFF MISCONDUCT CLAIMS WERE SIMPLY RE CATEGORIZED BY THE WHARTON AS ROUTINE APPEALS. NEXT A FULL TWO YEARS AFTER SURE INCE'S WERE GIVEN TO THIS COMMUNITY THIS COMMITTEE NO AUDIT FUNCTION IS ANYWHERE IN SIGHT. THE DEPARTMENT NOT ONLY HAS NO VISIBILITY ON WHETHER THE GRIEVANCE PROCESS IS WORKING OR NOT THE DEPARTMENT HAS NO SYSTEM THAT ALLOWS ITSELF TO PRODUCE REPORTS IDENTIFYING OFFICERS WHO HAVE BEEN IF YOU KEEP THIS CONTENT. OFFICERS WHO HAD THOSE ACCUSATIONS CORROBORATED. FOR WHO HAVE BEEN PUNISHED. FINALLY JUST AS THE SALINAS VALLEY TWO YEARS AGO THIS PROCESS EXONERATE STAFF AT AN ASTONISHING WORKED STAFF WERE EXONERATED NINETY EIGHT POINT 3% OF THE TIME IN THE CASES LOOK AT EITHER BY AIMS ARE THOSE HANDLED IN HOUSE WITH THE PRESENTS. IN FACT UNDER THIS PROCESS THE RATE OF EXONERATIONS EXCEEDS WHAT WE FOUND AT SALINAS VALLEY TWO YEARS AGO. INSTEAD OF WHAT WAS PROMISED TWO YEARS AGO THE DEPARTMENT. DESIGNED A SYSTEM WITH MANY OFF RAMPS. THAT PREVENT A FAIR AND INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION OF AN MADE ALLEGATIONS OF STAFF MISCONDUCT. DESPITE PROFESSING TO AGREE WITH THE RECOMMENDATIONS THE DEPARTMENT IMPLEMENTED FEW IF ANY OF OUR RECOMMENDATIONS. OF NOTE THE SECRETARY AND I HAD A VERY POSITIVE CONVERSATION ABOUT THESE ISSUES LAST WEEK AND IN RESPONSE TO HERBAGE INVITATION. I LOOK FORWARD TO COLLABORATING WITH THE DEPARTMENT ON THESE AND OTHER ISSUES. THANK YOU AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE. WITH THANK YOU OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS FROM CDC ARE. GOOD AFTERNOON- CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY COMMITTEE KATHLEEN ALISON SECRETARY FOR CDC ARE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE TODAY TO ADDRESS THIS VERY SERIOUS ISSUE. THIS ISSUE OF OUR APPEALS AND GRIEVANCE PROCESS- TO INCLUDE STAFF COMPLAINTS IT'S VERY NEAR AND DEAR TO MY HEART WHEN I WAS THE DIRECTOR OF ADULT INSTITUTIONS I INITIATED EVEN BEFORE THE O. R. G. REPORT TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TO START THE PROCESS. TO REVAMP OUR APPEALS. I KNEW THIS FROM MY NAY YEARS EXPERIENCE IN. THE NUMBER OF STAFF COMPLAINTS OF THE NUMBER OF INMATE APPEALS. THAT HAVE FINDING VERSUS THE NUMBER OF ADVERSE ACTIONS. DIDN'T MATCH UP THE ADVERSE ACTIONS FAR EXCEEDED THE NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS THAT HAVE FINDINGS TO WARDENS IN THE END TRYING TO THEIR TO DO A RIGHT THING C. C. R. TAKES EVERY ALLEGATION OF STAFF MISCONDUCT VERY SERIOUSLY. AND WE ARE COMMITTED TO ENSURING ALL ALLEGATIONS ARE PROPERLY FAIRLY AND THOROUGHLY REVIEWED. WE WELCOME THE OFFICERS INSPECTOR GENERAL'S REVIEW AND THIS IS MISTER WESLEY SAID HE AND I'VE HAD CONVERSATIONS ON THIS AND I APPRECIATE HIS VERY THOROUGH REPORT I FIND IT INCREDIBLY VALUABLE INSIGHT ON THE STATUS OF OUR CURRENT PROCESS OF ALLEGATIONS AGAINST STAFF. BUT THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE AGENCY HAS DEMONSTRATED A COMMITMENT TO SEEK OUTSIDE INDEPENDENT REVIEWS OVERSTAFFED COMPLAINT PROCESS BY THE OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL THIS IS EVIDENT BY- OUR REQUEST FOR THE O. I. G. TO CONDUCT A THOROUGH SALINAS VALLEY STATE PRISON REVIEW WHICH PROMPTED THE JANUARY. TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN- I. G. REPORT. WE CHECK THOSE FINE OF THAT REPORT VERY SERIOUSLY TOOK STEPS TO INITIATE. AND IMPLEMENT VERY SURE RIGHT. IT SURE OF OUR ALLEGATION ACQUIRING SYSTEM WHICH AS MR WESLEY STATED IT WAS APPROXIMATELY TEN MILLION IN FUNDING AND FORTY SEVEN POSITIONS THIS PROCESS BEGAN TO ROLL OUT IN JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY WITH FULL IMPLEMENTATION IN APRIL OF TWENTY TWENTY YOU'RE IN THE THROES OF CODE NINETEEN. IT IS AN IMPROVEMENT FROM WHERE WE WERE BUT IT WAS NOT WITHOUT FLAWS. ACTIVATION OVER EIGHT HUNDRED OF THE MOST SERIOUS STAFF ALLEGATIONS HAVE BEEN REVIEWED COMPLETED. INDEPENDENT BY TRAIN TO INQUIRE STAFF TRAINED STAFF IN OUR AGENT JUST AS THE- I. G. WAS EVALUATING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR NEW PROCESS AND ACTIVATION OF AIMS WE WERE TO EVALUATING AND CORRECTING ALONG THE WAY. IT IS TRUE THE SITUATION REVIEWING THAT THE ALREADY AND GRIEVANCE COORDINATOR HAVE STRUGGLED WITH THE SCREENING. SAYS PUT IN PLACE AND CONFUSION LIKELY RESULTED AND SHE WERE ALLEGATIONS BEING SENT TO ENHANCE TO ADDRESS INTERNAL REVIEWS AND IMMEDIATE ACTION HAVE BEEN UNDER WAY THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS. BOTTOM LINE IS WE NEEDED TO COMPLEX. WE CONTINUE TO HOST REGULAR INTERACTIVE CONFERENCES WITHIN BETWEEN UNIT FORTIES AND GRIEVANCE COORDINATORS TO ADDRESS PARTICULAR ISSUES I'M NOT. YOU HAVE ALSO DONE A REVIEW OF THE PROPER APPLICATION OF REFERRALS TO WHAT THE L. A. G. IS AN ADULT. TWO OTHER WHICH HE HAS DONE ALLOWING US TO EDUCATE CORRECT THE ERRORS AS WE FIND THEM. ADDITIONALLY WE FIND THE AMOUNT OF TIMES ON EACH AIMS ENQUIRING. FOREXTV REGIONAL ESTIMATES THREE FULL TO ADDRESS. WE HAVE. A CURRENT TIME AND MOTION STUDY OF THE AIM SCREENING AND COREY PROCESS UNDER WAY WITH THE GOAL OF IDENTIFYING EFFICIENCIES. WITH ALL OF THIS WE EXPECTED VOLUME AIMS TO INCREASE AND WE EXPECT TO FIND EFFICIENCIES IN AMES PROCESS. THIS WILL PROVIDE US A MUCH MORE ACCURATE PICTURE. OF THE ONGOING WORKLOAD NEEDS AND COMMITMENT TRISH TORTURED FINDINGS BASED ON ARMED ASSESSMENT AS WELL AS- YG'S TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY ONE FEBRUARY TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE REPORT. THERE ARE SOME IMMEDIATE ACTIONS THAT ARE BEING ADDRESSED. FIRST SHIFTED INCONSISTENCIES OF APPLICATION THE COMPLEXITIES OF THE SCREENING AT THE LOCAL LEVEL I HAVE DIRECTED MY TEAM. TO AN IMMEDIATE STRATEGY TO IMPLEMENT A STATE WIDE CENTRALIZED SCREENING PROCESS FOR ALL ALLEGATIONS AGAINST STAFF RECEIVED BY THE INCARCERATED POPULATION. WITH THE EXCEPTION OF PRIYA WHICH ALREADY HAS A VERY ROBUST PROCESS MONITORED BY THE INSPECTOR GENERAL AND AUDITED BY- THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. IT REQUIRES REAL TIME ANALYSIS TO COLLECT EVIDENCE- AND THIS PROCESS IS WELL ESTABLISHED ALL THE WAY ACROSS THE NATION. THIS WILL PROVIDE A SINGLE INDEPENDENT SOURCE TO ENSURE THE CURRENT REGULATIONS ARE CORRECTLY APPLIED IN DETERMINING WHETHER STAFF MISCONDUCT SHOULD BE DEFERRED FOR PROCESSING AND REMOVES THE PROCESS FROM LOCAL CONTROL. THIS WILL ALLOW ALL ALLEGATIONS OF EXCESSIVE AND UNNECESSARY USE OF FORCE THIS WILL ALLOW FOR THE LOCAL GRIEVANCE COORDINATOR SHOULD SIMPLY FORWARD ANY GRIEVANCE RECEIVED THAT IS A STAFF COMPLAINED TO THE STATE WIDE CENTRALIZED SCREENING UNIT TO PROCESS AND FORWARD TO THE CORRECT AREA. OUR CURRENT PRACTICE TO THIS POINT HAS BEEN FOR THE LOCAL INSTITUTIONS TO DETERMINE IF A STAFF COMPLAINTS. WHAT'S FOUND TRUE M. WOULD LIKELY- RESULT IN ADVERSE ACTION THIS IS A COMPLEX ANALYSIS. AND THEREFORE I THINK PART OF THE PROBLEM. THIS COMMITMENT OF A CENTRALIZED SCREENING THE LOCAL INSTITUTIONS NO LONGER HAVE TO APPLY THIS COMPLEX SCREENING CRITERIA AND ENSURE ALL STAFF COMPLAINTS GOES TO AN INDEPENDENT OUTSIDE AREA. TO APPLY TO STANDARD SECONDLY. WE CURRENTLY PROCESS ALLEGATIONS OF EXCESSIVE UNNECESSARY FORCE WITH SERIOUS BODILY INJURY. GO TO GAME RECOGNIZING THEIR RESPONSE INJURY DOES NOT ACCOUNT FOR ALL INJURIES OUTSIDE OF THE DHINAC DEFINITION ESPIANDO. THEREFORE THE FIRST STEP I DIRECTED MY CHANGE INSTITUTE AND EXPAND ON THIS PROCESS ALL ALLEGATIONS OF EXCESSIVE OR UNNECESSARY FORCE WITH ANY INJURY. ARE TO BE REFERRED JAMES AND I COLLUDED- THOSE THAT DO NOT NEED TO INCLUDE THOSE THAT CURRENTLY DO NOT MEET THE SB I'D ALREADY ARE YOU SUPPORT PROCESSES ARE MIRRORED BY THE OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL THEY MONITOR THEM IN A REAL TIME OUR REVIEW PROCESS. ARGUMENT THAT AS WELL. THIRD I HAVE DIRECTED MY FOR TO. AND APPLIANCES WERE AIMS WILL PROVIDE A CLEAR. CONCLUSION WHICH WILL INDICATE TO OUTCOMES ONE A THOROUGH AND COMPLETE IN CARD HAS BEEN COMPLETED THAT INCLUDES ALL FACTS AND EVIDENCE. THEY BELIEVE AVAILABLE TO REASONABLE MISCONDUCT HAS OCCURRED WHICH WILL LEAD TO ADVERSE ACTION. WHEN REASONABLE BELIEF IS ACIEVED. AND BURST OUT AND OUR PROCESS A REQUEST FOR AN INVESTIGATION WILL BE INITIATED BY THE AMES TEAM FOR THE HIRING AUTHORITY THIS WILL ALLOW THE CASE TO MOVE SWIFTLY FROM REQUIRE RETURN DESTINATION. MY EXPECTATION IS THAT THE HARNESS OR THE LOCAL LEVEL DISAGREES REQUEST FOR INVESTIGATION FACIAL IMMEDIATELY EVALUATE THAT TO THE AMES CHIEF FOR A RESOLUTION ALLOWING FOR MONITORING OVERSIGHT AND THE STATEWIDE LEVEL. AND ANY FURTHER AND I JUST THIS AGREEMENT WILL BE RAISED TO THE ASSOCIATE. DIRECTOR OF GLOBAL. I THINK THIS IS AND- BECAUSE I WILL SAY AFTER REVIEWING MANY OF THE AIMS- REPORTS. IT'S A LOT OF WORDS I MEAN I'M VERY FAMILIAR WITH THE PROCESS WHAT INSTITUTIONS I ISSUE STAFF SKEWS ME INVESTIGATORS STYLE ROAD REPORT. AND IF THERE WAS A LOT OF INFORMATION WITH NO REAL CONCLUSION- AND SOMETIMES WE MISS THE NEXT OBVIOUS QUESTION. AND I'M I'M VERY COMMITTED TO US BEING DEPARTMENT OF INTEGRITY AND HAVING THIS PROCESS BE VERY THOROUGH. IN ADDITION TO THE FIRST THREE ACTIONS WE AGREE THAT THE DEFINITION OF THE STAFF COMPLAINT REQUIRES MODIFICATION. CREATE A MORE EFFECTIVE PROCESS. DOING CHOIR STAFFEL CONSIDERATION AS TO NOT FIX ONE PROBLEM AND INADVERTENTLY CREATE ANOTHER THEREFORE I DIRECTED STAFF. TO AND TO DO THIS EFFICIENTLY AND TO SEEK INPUT. NOT ONLY THE OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL BUT THE LEGISLATURE I'M FINE YOUR STAFF TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS PROCESS WHETHER IT'S THROUGH REGULAR MEETINGS- TO BE BRIEFED OR SIT AT THE TABLE AS WE WORK THROUGH AND IDENTIFY ADDITIONAL CONCERNS. WE'RE READY. ABOUT THE LIMITATIONS OF ALLEGATIONS- MORE THAN THIRTY DAYS AFTER ALLEGED INCIDENT SO I ASKED TO HAVE THAT EVALUATED CURRENTLY THE PROCESS AND IF IT'S BEYOND THIRTY DAYS- WHEN AN OFFENDER TURNS IT TO THE AIMS UNIT IN AND SENT BACK TO THE INSTITUTION FOR ANALYSIS SO WE- ARE IN THE PROCESS. YEAH MY STAFF. J. OTHER JURISDICTIONS WILL BEST TRACK. FURTHER THE DEPARTMENT RECOGNIZE THAT THE- MULTIPLE ISOLATED DATA SYSTEMS ARE NOT UP TO. MAKING REPORTS. YEAH DIFFICULT AND FOR DUE TO THE FOCUS OF HOPE AND MANY THINGS- THAT WAS NOT A PRIORITY DURING DURING TWO THOUSAND BECAUSE EVERYBODY WAS FOCUSED ON KOBE. SO WE'RE NOT ABLE TO DEDICATE THE RESOURCES NECESSARY- TO ADDRESSING THE DATA SYSTEMS ASCOCHYTA IS RESOLVING WITHIN OUR INSTITUTIONS WITH LESS THAN THREE HUNDRED CASES TODAY. WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO FINDING AN IT SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM ONCE ONCE AND FOR ALL. I AM COMMITTED TO HAVING THESE ITEMS REVIEWED SWIFTLY. AND THOROUGHLY. BINARY TREE SHAPE THE SUPPORT. OF THIS COMMITTEE ON TRAINING ANALYSTS AND CAROLERS IN OUR REQUEST FOR ADDITIONAL CAMERAS AT R. J. D. AND L. A. C. FOR FACILITIES BE ANTI. WHICH IS INCLUDED IN OUR ARMSTRONG PROPOSAL I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT ADDITIONAL CAMERAS WILL SIGNIFICANTLY BENEFIT REDUCING STAFF COMPLAINS. WE HAVE SEEN FIRST HAND THE BENEFIT OF CAMERAS AT OUR FACILITIES SPECIFICALLY AT HIGH DESERT AND CCW OUT FOR- IN CHOWCHILLA CALIFORNIA CENTRAL CALIFORNIA WOMEN'S FACILITY. CRISTINA MARKET DECREASE AN ALLEGATION ENQUIRE RES- CAMERAS MAKE EVERYBODY BEHAVE SO I CERTAINLY SUPPORT THOSE THOSE EFFORTS- GOING FORWARD. IN THE COURT ORDER FOR BODY WORN CAMERAS AT RJD WE ARE READY TO BE AMONG THE FIRST CORRECTIONAL ENVIRONMENT TO DEPLOY AND ASSESS THE USE OF BODY CAMERAS. WHICH UP TO THIS POINT HAVE BEEN RELATIVELY SMALL FOOTPRINT IN A CORRECTIONAL SYSTEM. IT IS DIFFERENT FROM MORE ESTABLISHED LANDSCAPE OF COMMUNITY POLICE DEPARTMENTS. I WANT TO REITERATE TO THE COMMITTEE. MY RECOGNITION IS THAT THERE'S- WATCH TO IMPROVE IN THIS CURRENT PROCESS AS LAID OUT BY THE INSPECTOR GENERAL'S REPORT MY COMMITMENT TO CREATE A SWIFT PROCESSES AND MY OPENNESS TO WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE WHILE DOING SO. I WOULD LIKE TO TURN IT OVER. TO OUR FISCAL SERVICES DIRECTOR ERIC SWANSON DIRECTOR AMY AND ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR SPAN RIGHT TO BELIEVE. PROVIDE A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF OUR ARMSTRONG COMPLAINTS PROPOSAL.

THANK YOU I HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS BUT FOR SURE MY COLLEAGUES FROM THOSE VIDEOS WANT TO ASK THEM QUESTIONS TO SOME I THINK A DEFERRED YOU GUYS VERSUS THIS IS BEEN GOING ON TO SEE IF I GOT HIM A SYSTEM ON CHIP I HAD TO KICK IT OFF. THANK YOU. SECRETARY ALISON WITHOUT WITH ALL DUE RESPECT. YOU HAVE A SIGNIFICANT CREDIBILITY PROBLEM RIGHT NOW. ON THIS ISSUE GIVEN WHAT WE WERE TOLD TWO YEARS AGO WHEN WE APPROVE THIS MONEY HOW IT WAS USED AND THE STANDARD THAT WAS SET UP. TO USE THIS MONEY AND TO ADDRESS. YOU MAKE COMPLAINTS ABOUT STAFF ACTIONS IS JUST ASTONISHING TO ME THAT THE. EXCUSE OF IT BEING COMPLICATED WHEN REALLY YOU IT SEEMS LIKE THE SYSTEM WAS SET UP. WITH TOO MANY GATES TO ENSURE THE COMPLAINTS AND NEVER GOT TO THE UNIT. AND NOW YOU'RE ACTUALLY ASKING US FOR MORE MONEY. TO PROVIDE OVERSIGHT FOR A SYSTEM THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE OVERSIGHT OVER COMPLAINT DRIVEN SYSTEM. AND BY THAT JUST BY THE NUMBER. THAT THE INSPECTOR GENERAL REPORTS. A FIFTH OR LESS OF THE EXPECTED ACTIVITY HAPPENED WITH WHAT WE WERE FUNDING. SO I HAVE TO ASK IN THIS IS PROBABLY THE LEAST SIGNIFICANT QUESTION IS WHERE DID THE REST OF THE MONEY GO. BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY AND SO THAT THAT'S A BIG ISSUE THAT. THAT IF WE ALLOCATE MONEY FOR SOMETHING AND IT'S CLEARLY NOT BEING SPENT THEIR IT IT'S BEEN SPENT SOMEPLACE ELSE. WHEN YOU COME BACK AND ASK FOR MORE MONEY FOR SOMETHING. IT'S REALLY HARD FOR US TO UNDERSTAND. AND HAVE CONFIDENCE THAT THAT MONEY WILL BE SPENT ON ON HOW IT'S HOW YOU'RE SAYING. I'M NOT SURE THIS COMMITTEE SHOULD ALLOW. MORE MONEY TO FIX THE PROBLEM THAT SHOULDN'T HAVE ARISEN IN THIS WAY IN THE FIRST PLACE. SO THAT'S A REAL CHALLENGE FOR ME SITTING HERE RIGHT HERE NOW I KNOW YOU CAN BE WORKING WITH-THE INSPECTOR GENERAL AND ANOTHER SOME PROCESSES THAT THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED AND TO BE CLEANED UP. SO FOR. HOW MAY BE WILLING TO SPEND MORE MONEY IN THIS AREA I THINK WE REALLY REALLY NEED TO UNDERSTAND HOW. THIS IS GOING TO BE FIXED. AND IT'S FAIRLY CLEAR. THAT THERE ARE TOO MANY PEOPLE WHO HAVE THE ABILITY OF SPEAKING SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THE WARDENS TO HEAD OFF A COMPLAINT. AND MAKE IT SEEM INSIGNIFICANT WHEN IT MIGHT BE. AND SO YOU YOU'VE GOT VARIOUS LEVELS OF ACTUAL INTERFERENCE. WITH A PROCESS THAT YOU DESIGN. AND THAT WAS SOLD TO US AS BEING WORTHY OF SOME ADDITIONAL FUNDING. WITH THE RHETORIC THAT. WE SEEM TO HAVE HAD AGREEMENT. ON WHAT WAS MOVING FORWARD AND HOW IN THE AND THAT TURNED OUT TO BE JUST NOT TRUE SO I'M REALLY STRUGGLING RIGHT NOW. WITH HOW WE CAN MOVE FORWARD. AND HOW YOU ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO SET UP A SYSTEM. GIVEN THEIR INTERNALCULTURE AND THE PROTECTIVE NATURE OF YOUR POINT CURRENT EMPLOYMENT STRUCTURE. THAT SEEMS TO PREDETERMINE. OUTCOMES FROM COMPLAINTS OR TO DISMISS COMPLAINTS. ARBITRARILY WITHOUT GIVING ANY REAL SERIOUS CONSIDERATION TO WHAT TRULY HAPPENED AND WHAT THE REMEDIES ARE GOING TO BE. SO HOW ARE YOU GOING TO. BE ABLE TO CONVINCE US N. AND HOW TO RECOVER THE CREDIBILITY HERE. IN A WAY THAT THAT WE CAN. BOB IS REALLY TRYING TO FIND A PATH TO MOVE FORWARD WITH ALL OF THIS AND I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO SEE THOSE CHANGES MADE AND MADE NOW. BEFORE YOU GONNA COME BACK TO US TO ASK FOR MORE INFO FOR MORE MONEY BECAUSE IT JUST LOOKS TO ME LIKE MONEY THAT HAD BEEN SPENT. FOR THE MONEY THAT WE GAVE YOU HAS BEEN MISSPENT. AND I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO SEE THIS PROCESS FIXED. AND FIXED RIGHT AWAY. AND IN A WAY THAT THAT IS TRACEABLE IS AUDIBLE IS MANAGEABLE. AND THAT YOU CAN SHOW SOME SIGNIFICANT OUTCOMES. AND I'M NOT SURE WHAT ELSE TO SUGGEST AS A WAY OF KIND OF GETTING BACK SOME OF THAT CREDIBILITY TO ME WHEN I READ THIS I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT AND THEN JUST SITTING HERE LISTENING TO THE TESTIMONY. AND THINKING BACK TO THE HEARINGS FROM A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO I'M JUST ASTONISHED THAT WE'RE IN THIS PLACE. SO IF YOU WANT OUR HELP HELP US HELP YOU BUT YOU'VE GOT A LONG WAYS TO GO TO SHOW HOW THE SYSTEM CAN BE FIXED CAN BE ADDRESSED AND THAT WE CAN GET IT TO EVEN BEGIN TO LOOK LIKE WHAT WAS PROMISED WHEN THIS MONEY WAS APPROVED. UNDERSTOOD YOUR- EMAIL SAID O. C. C. R. YOU KNOW I AGREE WITH YOU THAT THERE ARE MANY OBSTACLES PUT IN PLACE THAT BECAME MORE DIFFICULT- TO EVEN REFER CASES TO THE ANCIENT OF THE EXCLUSIONARY CRITERIA SOME OF IT WAS CONCERNING- COUPLED WITH. OTHER PROCESSES UNDERSTAND THAT WE STILL HAVE WARDENS FOR HIGHER THIRTIES CONSERVE REFER CASES UP OVER FOUR INVESTIGATION OUTSIDE OF THE AIMS PROCESS AND WE HAVE APPROXIMATELY ANYWHERE FROM TWO THOUSAND TO TWENTY FOUR HUNDRED OF THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS THAT I'VE BEEN REFERRED FOR INVESTIGATION WHICH WERE RESULTING IN ADVERSE ACTIONS ANYWHERE FROM TWELVE HUNDRED TO FIFTEEN HUNDRED ADVERSE ACTIONS. SO WARDENS DO- HAVE THE ABILITY TO FOLLOW THIS PROCESS I WAS RELEASED AIMS IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT WHEN IT WAS IN THE INFANCY- I DO AGREE NEEDS TO BE FIXED IT NEEDS TO BE FIXED NOW I PRIDE MYSELF ON BEING A PERSON OF INTEGRITY AND THIS DEPARTMENT IN A DEPARTMENT OF INTEGRITY AND IN ORDER TO DO THAT YOU HAVE TO HAVE STAFF PROPERLY TRAINED YOU HAVE TO HAVE AN INVESTIGATIVE INQUIRY PROCESS. THAT IS THOROUGH AND TRANSPARENT. I'M ANXIOUS TO GET THERE AS- I WILL SAY THAT THE CORRECTIONAL POLICY RESEARCH AN INTERNAL OVERSIGHT UNIT WHO TOOK OVER THE APPEAL- THE APPEALS AND GRIEVANCE PROCESS. IT IS IMPORTANT REYES. HAS WORKED TIRELESSLY TO TRY AND GET THIS RIGHT BUT IT'S NOT RIGHT YOU MIGHT AS I SIT HERE IN FRONT OF YOU IT IS NOT RIGHT BUT I AM COMMITTED TO FIX AND THAT'S A LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU. YOUR STAFF AND THE OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL GOING FORWARD- THE THING. HOW. I'M USUALLY NOT A LOSS FOR WORDS BUT TRULY AT A COMPLETE LOSS OF WORDS I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA WHAT YOU'VE BEEN SAYING. AT HOME. DID YOU WATCH THE VIDEO AND WOULD YOU AGREE THAT SECRETARY DíAS TO HEAR FROM THIS CHAIR RIGHT HERE A YEAR AGO- PROMISING TO HAVE A COMPLETELY INDEPENDENT- PROCESS. UNFORTUNATELY THE VIDEO CUT OUT BUT I WAS IN THAT HEARING TWO YEARS AGO WHEN MR DíAS SAID I SAW- I RECALL EXACTLY WHAT HE HAS SAID. AND IT THE PROCESS DID GO OVER TO AN INDEPENDENT- UNIT IT WAS NO LONGER IN THE DIVISION OF ADULT INSTITUTIONS IS WHERE APPEALS PROCESS LAID BEFORE. IT IS NOW AN OUTSIDE UNIT THAT REPORTS TO THE UNDERSECRETARY OF ADMIN NOT THE UNDERSECRETARY OF OPERATIONS. HOWEVER THE PROCESS AND THE AIMS PROCESS. WAS TOO COMPLEX TO. BUDGETARY CRITERIA FOR BUT THAT WASN'T MY QUESTION SO. THAT THE SECRETARY START HERE SAID IN FRONT OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE THAT HE- PROMISED A COMPLETELY. INDEPENDENT PROCESS WOULD YOU AGREE WITH THAT. YES THEY GET YES OR NO QUESTION SECRETARY. YES THAT IS WHAT HE SAID I HOWEVER I DO AGREE WITH THAT WOULD YOU AGREE WITH THAT. FIGURE I DID NOT SEE HIS WORDS IN REAL TIME TODAY. I CAN NOT YOU SAID YOU WERE HERE AT THE HEARING WOULD YOU AGREE THAT YOU PROMISED THIS COMMITTEE. EIGHTY EIGHT AND A SEPARATE INDEPENDENT PROCESS. THAT IS MY RECALL YES BURKE SO WHO WHO UNDERNEATH HIM UNDERMINED HIM AND DECIDED TO NOT FOLLOW HIS INSTRUCTIONS. WHO IN YOUR DEPARTMENT. I HAVE NO IDEA ITWAS SET UP THROUGH A SEPARATE ENTITY OUT OF THE OPERATIONS UNIT BUT I WILL SAY I'M I'M SITTING HERE BEFORE YOU TODAY TO COMMIT TO FIXING IT. UP FIRST AND GOAL I HAVEN'T HEARD A SINGLE THING ON HOW YOU'RE GOING TO FIX IT FOR YOU YOU DO YOU CAN OU TALK ABOUT HOW THE PROCESS IS COMPLICATED WE AGREED YOU INSERTED. THE WARDENS INTO AN INDEPENDENT PROCESS. SO YOU'RE RIGHT IT IS COMPLICATED WHY WHY DID THE DEPARTMENT COMPLICATE. THIS RATHER SIMPLISTIC PROCESS BY INSERTING THE WARDENS INTO THE PROCESS. I CANNOT SPEAK FOR PARTY LEADERSHIP WHAT I CAN'T SPEAK TO THE PARDON FOR HOW MANY YEARS NOW. YOU ACT LIKE YOU ARE A NEW EMPLOYEE HOW MANY YEARS HAVE BEEN AT THE TOP HAVE YOU BEEN A PART. THERE I DON'T WANT TO DEPARTMENT MANY YEARS AS YOU NOW THIRTY THREE THIRTY FOUR- SO YOU'VE BEEN AROUND FOR PRIOR MINISTRATION. WHAT WAS YOUR PREVIOUS JOB BEFORE THIS. UNDER SECRETARY OF OPERATIONS THIS THIS PROCESS DID NOT FALL FALL UNDER THE OPERATIONS YOU YOU ARE ON THIS IS UNDERSECRETARY YOU'RE PART OF THE LEADERSHIP TEAM. YES I WAS AND I WAS SURPRISED AT ITS USE ARGUE REMAIN AND YOU ARE AND YOU CONTINUE TO BE. SO WHY DID THE DEPARTMENT. SO YOU'RE TELLING ME AS PART OF THE SECRETARY LEADERSHIP TEAM YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHO SEVERE SCHOOL SUBVERTED HIS INTENTION TO HAVE AN INDEPENDENT PROCESS. IN OUR ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE NAY UNDER SECRETARY HAVE ADMIN. REPORTS DIRECTLY TO THE SECRETARY AND UNDERSECRETARY OF OPERATIONS REPORTS DIRECTLY TO THE SECRETARY. AND THAT OVER TIME THE UNDERSECRETARY OF ADMIN MADE THAT DECISION TO SUBVERT THE INTENTION OF THE SECRETARY. I DON'T KNOW WHO MADE THAT DECISION SIR BUT THE PERSON SOMEBODY IN DOT IN THAT OPERATION YOU'RE SAYING THAT. BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT TAKING RESPONSIBILITY FOR MADE ALONG THE WAY THAT CHANGED IT I THINK THE EXCLUSIONARY CRITERIA AS WELL AS HAVING THE WORK TO MAKE THE DECISION THAT WE WHO MADE THAT DECISION BECAUSE YOU SAID YOU ARE SO COMMITTED TO FIXING IT. HOW CAN YOU FIX THE PROBLEM IF YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW WHO MADE THE DECISION. BECAUSE I PROVIDE CLEAR DIRECTION. AND I WILL HAVE CONSTANT OVERSIGHT OF THIS PROBLEM WITH A LOT SECRETARY SAID. I CANNOT SPEAK TO WHAT HE SAID I CAN ONLY COUNT FOR MYSELF WILL YOU LOOK WHAT WORKED I WON'T LET MYSELF WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM. SANTA CRUZ A THING THAT YOU HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO CREDIBILITY RIGHT NOW BECAUSE YOU HAVEN'T DEMONSTRATED. YOU HAVE A GRASP OF WHAT THE PROBLEM IS AND YOU HAVEN'T TOLD US YOU SAID THE WORD WE'RE GOING TO FIX THE PROBLEM THE NUMBER TIMES YOU HAVEN'T TOLD US HOW YOU CAN FIX IT HOW YOU HOW YOU CAN FIX THE PROBLEM. IF YOU CAN EVEN IDENTIFY WHERE THE PROBLEM IS. THE PROBLEM LIES WITH. ALL OF THE ALLEGATIONS GOING THROUGH THE PROCESS OF THE LOCAL INSTITUTION. EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOU DOING PERFECT. WE UNDERSTAND THE- YEAH I DID THE RESPECT GIVE ME THE RESPECT FINISH. EVERY ALLEGATION WILL BE IMMEDIATELY FORWARDED TO THE OUTSIDE UNIT. OBJECTIVE AS SOON AS MY FALCON FINISH THE DOCUMENTATION ON THE MEMO OUT TO STAFF THAT WILL IMMEDIATELY TAKE PLACE AND THEY WILL NO LONGER GO THROUGH SCREENING AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. THAT IS THE FIRST AND FOREMOST CORRECTION THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE. SECONDLY ALL USE OF FORCE ALLEGATIONS WILL GO TO ALL USE OF FORCE EXCESSIVE OR UNNECESSARY FORCE WILL GO TO THE INCIDENT IMMEDIATELY WORK WORD DRESSING THE VERY SPECIFIC POINTS OF THE OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL THAT HE HIGHLIGHTED IN HIS REPORT AS WELL AS OUR FINDINGS. AS WELL AS PROVIDING CLEAR. WHEN THE REPORT IS DONE TO BOOK CLEAR CONCLUSION THE REPORTS NOW JUST LIST ALL THE VARIOUS INTERVIEWS OF WHAT EVERYBODY SAID WITH NO FINAL RECOMMENDATION NO DRAFTING OF THE INVESTIGATION REQUEST DOCUMENT WHICH IS CRITICAL IN THIS PROCESS THOSE ARE THE TOP THREE THINGS THAT WERE GOING TO FIX IT IMMEDIATELY. THANK YOU FOR THAT SO ON IS THE IS THERE A REASON PRIOR TO COMING. BEFORE THE COMMITTEE YOU ALREADY HAD A COPY OF THE REPORT WHY THEY WEREN'T ALREADY DONE AND DONE CENTER. I'M SORRY SIR I'M NOT SURE I UNDERSTAND YOUR QUESTION A BUBBLE ONCE ONCE THE- OFF OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL'S REPORT WAS MADE- YOU KNOW WAS WAS WAS GIVEN TO YOU YOU YOU OBVIOUSLY HAD A RECORD OF THIS- WHAT WHY WASN'T IT DONE AS SOON AS YOU WERE MADE AWARE OF THE ISSUE. HE. CHAPTER IMMEDIATELY I CAN PROBABLY GIVE YOU THE EXACT DAY WHERE I MET WITH SOUTH AFTER READING THAT REPORT I RECEIVED A REPORT A FEW DAYS AHEAD OF THE FEBRUARY SIXTEENTH AND I'D ALREADY HAD A MEETING AND WE'RE IDENTIFYING VERY CRITICAL PIECES TO FIX AND THOSE WITH THE TOP THREE THAT WERE IMMEDIATELY IDENTIFIED JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO VOLUME WISE HANDLE THE LOAD BECAUSE I HAVE TO TRAIN STAFF THIS TRAINING CRITICAL COMPONENT I HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE STAFF SCREENING THESE- ALLEGATION CHOIRS ARE THOROUGHLY TRAINED SO THAT THEY. CAN BE HANDLED IN A PROPER MANNER. WHAT WILL YOU WEAR OF THE ISSUE PRIOR TO THIS GENERAL'S REPORT BEING RELEASED. HE YES WE HAD SOME INDEPENDENT REVIEWS GOING ON- THROUGH OUR- COOKS CORRECTIONAL RESEARCH CORRECTION POLICY RESEARCH AN INTERNAL OVERSIGHT UNIT. WAS DOING INDEPENDENT REVIEWS AND DISCOVERED SOME SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS AND THEY HAD ALREADY RECOMMENDED. THAT WE CHANGE SOME OF THE DEFINITIONS. WARDENS I WILL SAY THAT THE WARDENS WERE MADE THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE FOUND THAT THE WARDENS WERE NOT APPROPRIATELY APPLYING WHAT WE GAVE THEM WITHIN THE PARAMETERS ONE OF THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS THAT WE HAVE WITH THAT DEFINITION THAT MAY LEAD TO ADVERSE ACTION. WHAT WAS THE NUMBER ONE AREA OF CONCERN- BUT WE DIDN'T FIND WATER BORDERS pWERE INTENTIONALLY NOT FORWARDING CASES ON THAT IS NOT WHAT WE FOUND IT WAS HONESTLY THAT. THE PROCESS WAS TOO COMPLICATED THEY DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION SO DEFINITELY LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING A OUTSIDE SCREENER AND THEN. GIVING THEM GOOD INFORMATION AT THE VERY END. FOR OUR INVESTIGATION PROCESS. ALSO DO YOU THINK YOU'LL HOW LONG THINK WILL TAKE THE TWO- THE STAFF SO THAT WE CAN HAVE AN- PROCESS THAT WILL BE IMPLEMENTED. I'M THIS IS WHAT I'M GOING TO SAY BECAUSE I THINK WE HAVE TO HIRE SOME STAFF- AND GET THEM TRAINED SO. WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO IS PROVIDE YOU REGULAR UPDATES I WANT TO SAY THIRTY TO SIXTY DAYS BUT THE STATE HIRING PROCESSES TAKES WHILE- IS AS WE ALL KNOW BUT I WANT TO DEFINITELY WORK WITH YOUR STAFF AND IF YOU WANT TO SIGN A STAFF MEMBER TO WORK WITH US ON OUR- OR RECEIVE REGULAR BRIEFINGS YOURSELF. I'M CERTAINLY WELCOME AND- TO DO THAT. WELL LET'S JUST SAY BY THE END OF MAY WHICH IS WHEN WE FINISH OUR BUDGET DELIBERATION PROCESS WE SHOULD HAVE A PRETTY CLEAR IDEA OF. THE YOU KNOW HOW THE- NEW PROCESSES IS BEING IMPLEMENTED WHETHER WE WERE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT IS THAT FAIR. STILL THERE SIR THANK YOU ARM SO WE HEARD SECRETARY DíAS A STATEMENT ARE YOU. COMMITTING TO THIS COMMITTEE AS WELL TO HAVE AN INDEPENDENT. A REVIEW PROCESS. SO THE ALLEGATIONS INQUIRES EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM WILL COME OUT OF THE INSTITUTIONS AND GO TO A CENTRALIZED SCREENING UNIT. VERY COMMITTED TO MAKING THAT HAPPEN- PROVIDING WHATEVER NECESSARY DATA IN A BE HAPPY TO PROVIDE. ON OUR ALLEGATION CHOIR IS COMPLETED AS WELL AS- OUR INVESTIGATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN REFERRED. SOMETIMES EVEN OUTSIDE OF AN ALLEGATION CHOIR SOMETIMES WARDENS HAVE ENOUGH TO FORWARD AND INCIDENTS- FOR ADVERSE ACTION DIRECTLY OUTSIDE OF THE ALLEGATION REQUIRED PROCESS. THANK YOU HOW HOW LONG DO YOU THINK IT'LL TAKE TO. CREATE THE CENTRALIZED DATA PROCESSING YOU YOU HAD MENTIONED THAT OBVIOUSLY TAKES TIME- THE STATE'S TRADITIONALLY STRUGGLED WITH PUTTING TOGETHER- DATABASES- I. T. PROJECT I DON'T KNOW HOW BIG A PROJECT THIS IS THE YOU ENVISIONED HOW MUCH TIME DO YOU THINK YOU IT WOULD TAKE TO COME UP WITH A CENTRALIZED DATA PROCESS. OUR SYSTEM. YES I WOULD AGREE THAT'S PROBABLY THE MOST COMPLEX- PROCESS AND- TO BE ANY KIND OF ID PROCESS AND SHE SAID I'VE BEEN AROUND A LONG TIME- IT TAKES A LONG TIME TO GET THAT DONE I UNFORTUNATELY WE HAVE TO HOPEFULLY HAVE SOMETHING UNDER WAY WITH PLANNING OF DEPLOYMENT BY THE END OF MAY OF. OUR TWENTY TWENTY ONE. IT JUST OCCUR IS THERE A WAY TO MAKE IT JUST A SIMPLER. DATABASE I MEAN I'M NOT RECOMMENDING LIKE. EXCEL OR ACCESS BECAUSE THEY'RE A WAY TO DO SOMETHING THAT'S MORE. OFF THE SHELF AND HOW TO DO SOMETHING THAT IS YOU KNOW. PRETTY TIME INTENSIVE. NOT THE BEST PERSON TO ANSWER THAT IS I'M NOT A COMPUTER EXPERT BY ANY MEANS- AND I MAYBE MISS MILLER HAS HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO ASSESS THE FLOOR FURTHER THAN I HAVE- SO I'M GONNA AND ASKING ME TO. PROVIDE THIS INFORMATION AND GOOD AFTERNOON ASSEMBLYMEMBER TANG- SO THE IT THE CURRENT PROCESS FOR TRACKING ALLEGATIONS THAT AN INSTITUTION IS DONE ON A LOCAL ALLOCATION LOG IN UP TO THIS POINT IT ACTUALLY HAS BEEN A PRETTY SIMPLE- SPREADSHEET IF YOU WELL- THE UNFORTUNATE REALITY IS YOU COULDN'T ACTUALLY CROSS REFERENCE ANY INFORMATION IT. IT DIDN'T HAVE WHAT YOU NEEDED TO DO THAT- THE OTHER COMPLICATED PIECE OF THIS IS THAT WE ACTUALLY. KEEP INFORMATION IN SEVERAL DIFFERENT DATABASES. WITH THAT SAID THE DIVISION OF ADULT INSTITUTIONS IN OUR ENTERPRISE INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND OTHERS HAVE GOTTEN TOGETHER AND THEY'RE WORKING OUT AN I. T. SOLUTIONS. IDEALLY IT WOULD HAVE ALREADY BEEN ACTIVATED BUT UNFORTUNATELY WITH CO THAT RESOURCES WERE WORTH- MOVE OTHER PLACES OVER THE LAST YEAR- AND SO I ASK THIS PANDEMIC. STARTS TO TWO THINGS START TO GET BETTER- THE SECRETARY HAS COMMITTED TO MAKING SURE THAT THE RESOURCES ARE AVAILABLE TO GET THAT I. T. SOLUTION IN PLACE AND SO- ALREADY THERE'S ACTIVITY ON MAKING SURE THAT THE DIFFERENT DATA. SYSTEMS TALK TO EACH OTHER AND IF THERE IS A BEGINNING TO END FROM EVERY ALLEGATION THAT'S EVER MADE ALL THE WAY TO WHAT HAPPENED AS THE CAN. AND RIGHT NOW THE EXPECTATION IS END OF MAY FOR HAVING THAT. HOPEFULLY DEPLOYED OKAY PERFECT MY NAME ONLY CAME TO SEE ME AS I HOPE WE DON'T LET THE PERFECT BE THE ENEMY OF THE GOOD AND- WOULD RATHER HAVE. SOMETHING SIMPLER WITH SOME DATA THAN LIKE THE PERFECT SYSTEM THAT TAKES FOREVER SOURCE APPRECIATE THAT. JUST ONE ONE FINAL COMMENT LET ME JUST. DOUBLE THE INSPECTOR GENERAL'S HERE LET ME JUST. ON THANK FOR HIS. REPORT I WOULD JUST LIKE TO. SAY I THINK. THAT YOUR WORK OVER THE LAST NUMBER OF YEARS HAS REALLY. HELPED INFORM THIS COMMITTEE A LOT OF THE WORK THAT WE HAVE BEEN DOING- I PERSONALLY JUST WANT TO SAY HOW MUCH I APPRECIATE. THE ANALYSIS THAT THE THOUGHTFULNESS AND FRIEND FRANKLY. IN MY OPINION THE OBJECTIVITY THAT- THE INSPECTOR GENERAL BRINGS. IT'S NOT I DON'T FIND HIS REPORTS TO BE A GOTCHA REPORT BUT TO BE ON THE VERY OBJECTIVE AND VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD SO I JUST WANT TO THANK HIM AND HIS TEAM FOR ALL THEIR FATHER HARPER THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND I ACTUALLY HAVE SOME QUESTIONS FOR THE INSPECTOR GENERAL- SO. WE'RE GONNA WE'RE GONNA NINETY SOLUTION AND HOPE THAT WE SEE SOMETHING COME THE END OF MAY- MAKING DECISIONS BUT WHAT ARE YOU SOME OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS YOU THINK THAT DEPARTMENT CANBE DOING STARTING TOMORROW BEFORE MADE AT THE COULD BE IMPLEMENTED TO CREATE A BETTER SYSTEM WHAT CAN WHAT ARE IMMEDIATE THINGS WE COULD DO NOW IN YOUR- IN YOUR OPINION HERE. WELL I THINK THE SECRETARY ADDRESSED SOME OF THOSE THINGS- AGAIN WE HAD A DISCUSSION LAST WEEK- GETTING THE INSTITUTIONS OUT OF THE PROCESS. IS A BIG PART OF THAT- ELIMINATING THE OFF RAMPS FOR- INCREASE TO BE DUMPED AND OF SETTING UP A PROCESS WHERE- REPORTS CAN BE RUN AND DATA CAN BE CAPTURED TO ASSESS HOW THE PROGRAM IS WORKING ARE HUGE STEPS AND I THINK THOSE ARE- PROBABLY THE MAJOR THINGS THAT NEED TO BE DONE. IT CAN I MEAN CAN ALL THESE COMPLAINTS JUST BE SENT DIRECTLY TO AIMS NOW. I AYE SINGLE IMPEDIMENT TO THAT THE THERE HAS TO BE A PLACE THAT AIMS FOR THEM TO GO. BUT I THINK THAT- THE DEPARTMENT HAS A VERY GOOD MODEL IN ITS- IN ITS- OFFICE OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS FOR HAVING A CENTRAL- REVIEW OF ALLEGATIONS OF MISCONDUCT. SO I DON'T SEE ANY REASON WHY CAN'T OTHER THAN- ASSIGNING THE DUTIES. HOW LONG WOULD IT TAKE YOU TO FIND THOSE DUTIES. BEEN CHAIR KATHLEEN ALEX SAID- I WOULD LIKE TO COMMIT TO HAVING A MEMO OUT WITHIN A WEEK BECAUSE CENTRALIZED MAILBOX FOR THE INSTITUTION STAFF TO BE ABLE TO SEND THOSE- COMPLAINTS TO. AND SO MY STAFF USUALLY RIDING BECAUSE THIS IS- I KNOW THAT THEY'RE WORKING ON THE MEMO ALL AND HOW IT'S GOING TO WORK IN A PROCESS BUT WE'RE GONNA PUT SOME PARAMETERS AROUND THIS TO MAKE SURE THAT IT HAPPENS WE WILL FORWARD YOU A COPY. OF ONCE THAT IS COMPLETED VIA- YOUR BABY. IF GREAT ABOUT A WEEK WILL ABLE TO THAT BEFORE THE IMPLEMENTATION BEGAN TH YES MA'AM AND THAT'S BEEN ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S BEEN BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION THAT AT IN THE PAST- THE COMMITTEE WAS NOT GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW ANY NEW REGULATIONS ARE GOING TO BE USED TO IMPLEMENT- THIS PROCESS AND SO- I HEARD EARLIER THAT YOU ARE OPEN TO BOTH THE INSPECTOR GENERAL BUT ALSO THIS COMMITTEE BEGINNING GATES IN THAT PROCESS. ABSOLUTELY AND SO WE DEFINITELY WANT TO TAKE YOU UP. ON THAT- S. AS WELL- I GUESS YOU KNOW I LIKE TO THINK ABOUT IT WE HAVE THE AND THE MAY DEADLINE AND THAT'S AN ACTUAL DEADLINE I THINK AS YOU'RE TRYING TO REBUILD TRUST WITH THE COMMUTE WITH THE COMMITTEE- GIVEN THAT. THERE'S JUST NOT TRUST. AYE AND RIGHTFULLY SO WHAT ARE SOME STEPS. OR SOME ADDITIONAL MEMOS CORRESPOND THANK YOU SHARE WITH US ALONG THE WAY SO WE DON'T HAVE TO WAIT. BETWEEN ONE WEEK FROM THAT WE'RE GOING TO GET THE FIRST MEMO AND THEN MAKE WHAT IS THAT YOU KNOW WHAT ARE SOME BENCHMARKS THAT WE CAN LOOK FORWARD TO. WELL I WOULD LIKE TO SET UP REGULAR CADENCE MEETINGS OR BRIEFINGS WITH YOU WHATEVER. WORKS BEST FOR YOU- AND THE COMMITTEE WHETHER IT'S YOU KNOW BRIEFING YOUR STAFF ON A REGULAR CADENCE WHETHER WE SEND YOU A WEEKLY DOCUMENT OUR PROGRESS- WHATEVER YOU THINK WILL WORK BEST FOR YOU TO. KEEP BE REGULARLY INFORMED. I'D LIKE TO. PROVIDE YOU WITH VARIETY WHAT- THE INITIAL STEPS THAT WE'RE DOING. AND THEN OPEN CONVERSATION FOR THE SUBSEQUENT STEPS THAT I THINK- NEED TO BE EVALUATED BUT YOU NEED SOME TIME. I DEFINITELY WANT TO GET THIS THING RIGHT I. YEAH HOW DO I SAY THIS DON'T I RATHER I DON'T WANT TO RUSH IT I WANT TO GET IT RIGHT THIS TIME AND I CERTAINLY WELCOME- OF THE INPUT HAVE YOU AND YOUR STAFF. ALONG YOU KNOW THE PROBLEM THIS PROCESS- OKAY SO. WE DON'T WANT ONE I WANNA GO BACK TO MR THINGS COMMON THAT WE DON'T WANT THE PERFECT TO BE THE ENEMY OF THE GOOD AND SO WHILE WE DON'T WANT TO RUSH SOMETHING I DON'T WANT THINGS LIKE IT SOLUTIONS OR A PROCESS TO THE LATEST MUCH FURTHER- IF YOU'RE ASKING HAS COME JUNE THAT WE HAVE TO VOTE ON SOMETHING AND WE HAVE NO CONFIDENCE THAT'S NOT GOING TO BE A VERY GOOD. RESOLUTION OUT THERE INTO DEFINITELY WANT TO TAKE YOU UP ON THOSE REGULAR CONVERSATIONS WITH THE COMMITTEE SO WE COULD BE SAYING THAT WITH OUR MEMBERS WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IN ADDITION TO MEMBERS THAT WE ARE ABLE TO SEE ANY NEW REGULATIONS THAT ARE BEING PROPOSED REFORMS LIMITATION. US WE COULD ALSO MAKE SURE THAT IT MAKES SENSE TO US AND IT'S NOT OVERLY COMPLICATED. I'M AND THEN. JUST TO BE CLEAR WE ARE GOING TO RETWEET WE USE THE WORDS BEEN AND THAT CONFUSES ME AT TIMES TO BE KERRIGAN EVERY REMOVING AWARD IS WHEN THIS PROCESS- AND WE NEED TO THE WAIT STAFF. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THAT THAT THAT AIM SEPARATE FROM STAFF AT. THE PRESENCE. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR ASKING FOR THAT CLARIFICATION. YES ALL ALLEGATION CHOIR REESE WILL GO FROM THERE. IL'S OFFICE PICKS THEM UP FROM THE VARIOUS YARDS AT THE INSTITUTION. THEY WILL BE MAILED DIRECTLY TO AIMS OR INTO A EMAIL BOX FOR GAINES. RIGHT CLICK AND THEN AIMS WILL SCREEN THEM FOR A FINAL DETERMINATION ON WHAT TO DO% WITH THAT ALLEGATION EQUERRY. SO GIVEN THAT WE'RE GONNA BE SENDING STUFF DIRECTLY TO AIMS- AND THEY ARE GOING FROM HAVING. FIVE HUNDRED OR SO CLAIMS THAT THEY WERE GETTING ALL FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY CLAIMS I APOLOGIZE. I THE FIFTH INSPECTOR GENERAL IF AIMS IN A POSITION TO BE ABLE TO BE SUCCESSFUL- WITH EVERYTHING COMING DIRECTLY TO THEM OR THEIR ADDITIONAL THINGS THAT. THAT WE AT THE LEGISLATURE NEED TO BE AWARE OF TO ENSURE THAT THIS IS- THAT THIS SUCCESSFUL LAWYER AND INDEED THANK. YOU HAVE THE RESOURCES THAT ARE APPROPRIATE FOR THE INCREASING CASELOAD- ABOUT CITY. WELL OUR PLAN IS TO REDIRECT RESOURCES INITIALLY WE DO HAVE A TIME AND MOTION STUDY GOING ON RIGHT NOW AS WE- ENTER THIS NEW PROCESS- I WILL SAY KOBE HAS TAUGHT US A LOT AS FAR AS EFFICIENCIES AND THE UTILIZATION. OF THE VIDEO CAPABILITY WE LOSE A LOT OF TIME TRAVELING. TO INSTITUTIONAL INSTITUTION AND THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS WE LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING GREATER EFFICIENCIES THROUGH TECHNOLOGY. CAN I GIVE MY QUESTION WAS FOR THEIR- THE INSPECTOR GENERAL DO YOU FEEL THAT THEY HAVE ENOUGH RESOURCES THAT AIMS YOUR OPINION GIVEN TO REVIEW YOUR PARTICULARLY. THE ONLY COMMENT I COULD MAKE TO THAT IS THAT- AT THE MOMENT THEY DO NOT APPEAR TO BE WORKING AT THE CAPACITY. WHETHER THEY ACTUALLY HAVE ENOUGH RESOURCES I DON'T THINK YOU KNOW UNTIL YOU GET TO YOUR CAPACITY AND SEE WHAT THEIR WORKLOAD IS. SO I DON'T I CAN'T REALLY COMMENT ON WHETHER THEY HAVE ENOUGH I CAN ONLY TELL YOU THAT. THEY DON'T APPEAR TO BE WORKING AT CAPACITY. DO YOU HAVE AN ESTIMATE OF WHAT CAPACITY MIGHT BE. WELL THE ONLY DATA THAT I HAVE IS WHAT THEY PUT FORWARD IN THEIR B. C. P. HERE TWO YEARS AGO. OR A YEAR AGO- SO- AT THE TIME THEY INDICATED THAT THEY COULD DO FOUR HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FOUR BELIEVE- FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY FOUR COMPLAINTS A MONTH- INCREASE PER MONTH. AND THAT WAS- A LITTLE OVER ALMOST FIFTY SEVEN HUNDRED. INCREASE PER YEAR- THEY'RE NOT THERE YET SO- THAT'S THE DATA I HAVE I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THEIR- DATA IS ACCURATE- AND AGAIN I DON'T KNOW THAT YOU CAN. YOU CAN DETERMINE WHETHER IT'S ACCURATE UNTIL YOU'RE AT CAPACITY AND SEE WHAT IT IS YOU CAN'T GET. ARE YOU ARE YOU ABLE TO PROVIDE OVERSIGHT OF THIS NEW PROCESS. OUR OVERSIGHT IS EXTREMELY LIMITED- I HAVE FIVE PEOPLE FOR THE ENTIRE STATE- AND THE- AS AS YOU. AS I PREDICT THE NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS IS- MUCH MUCH MORE THAN FIVE PEOPLE CAN CAN MONITOR EVEN IF WE MONITOR ONLY A PORTION OF THOSE. I FEEL- SOUL I WOULD TELL YOU THAT I DON'T BELIEVE THAT- I. G. AS RESOURCE ADEQUATELY TO PROVIDE. A REASONABLE OVERSIGHT. OKAY HERE. WHEN A CUSTOMER ORDERS IF THEY'RE LUCKY. YES THANK YOU FIRST OF ALL I'D LIKE TO. THANK MISTER WESLEY FOR RESPONDING TO MY- MY QUESTION BACK IN FEBRUARY EIGHTH AND SENT ME A WRITTEN RESPONSE ABOUT MY- MY QUESTION YOU ARE UNABLE TO ANSWER. ABOUT SEGWIT NOT VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE FOLLOW UP DOESN'T HAPPEN ALL THE TIME- I JUST HAPPEN TO HAVE. SO THE UNIQUE TO THIS COMMITTEE IN EIGHTEEN YEARS OF A- ACTUALLY CONDUCTING. POTENTIAL APPOINTMENTS CONDUCTIVITY GEISHAS AND I WORK FOR A STATE AGENCY THAT HAS A LITTLE DIFFERENT DYNAMIC BUT- TAKES GREAT PRIDE AND FALLS UNDER A LITTLE DIFFERENT. SET OF LAWS THAT DICTATE HOW DO. CONDUCT THESE INVESTIGATIONS- FIRST OF ALL I HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS PROCEDURALLY FIRST OF ALL IT SEEMS LIKE. SOME OF THIS PROCESS WOULD BE NEGOTIATED THROUGH LABOR. CONCERNS OF MY RIGHT ON THAT. THE PROCESS ON HOW TO ADDRESS- A APPOINTMENTS CONDUCT IS THAT SOMEONE NEGOTIATED. ASSEMBLY MEMBER AT LUCKY THIS IS AMY MILLER AND YES YOU WOULD BE CORRECT THAT THAT INDEED SOME OF THIS FALLS INTO LABOR AGREEMENTS. YES I JUST WONDER HOW MUCH AUTHORITY YOU CAN. A SPEAK TO ON IMPROVEMENTS IN AND WAYS TO ADDRESS THIS PROCESS I WOULD THINK THAT. THERE ARE OTHER PARTIES THAT MIGHT BE INVOLVED IN THIS KIND OF A- PROCESS AND I'M I'M CURIOUS ABOUT WE TALK ABOUT ALLEGATION IN CORY'S AND- AND I'M SURE THAT THAT'S A SCREENING PROCESS JUST BECAUSE OF THE SHEER VOLUME OF. POTENTIAL OF MISCONDUCT CIRCUMSTANCES THAT YOU ADDRESS BUT WHAT IS THE STANDARD BY WHICH IT MOVES FROM. THAT INQUIRY TO AN ACTUAL INVESTIGATION IS A PREPONDERANCE OF EVIDENCE OR IS IT IS A GREATER THAN THAT. ASSEMBLY MEMBER LACKEY THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION ACTUALLY WE WORK WITH- THE STANDARD OF REASONABLE BELIEF. THAT TO MOVE AN INQUIRY INTO AN INVESTIGATION AND SO WE'RE LOOKING AT THE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES THAT A PRUDENT PERSON RELIES ON IN ADDITION TO THEIR TRAINING EXPERIENCE AND EXPERIENCE AND KNOWLEDGE TO FORMULATE A GOOD FAITH BELIEF. THAT AN INDIVIDUAL HAS CONDUCTED THE MISCONDUCT SO. WHERE A HIGH ARE WHERE AN ALLEGATION WITHOUT EVIDENCE DEFINITELY. WOULDN'T GO INTO OUR INQUIRY- THOUGHT PROCESS ONCE WE REACH THAT REASONABLE BELIEF STANDARD- IT WOULD THEN. GO. INTO AN INVESTIGATION PROCESS. OKAY WILL PLAY YOU FOR THAT LAST YEAR- YEAH I THINK IT WAS LAST YEAR MAYBE TWO YEARS AGO THIS COMMITTEE EXPRESSES CONCERN THAT SEXUAL MISCONDUCT AND HARASSMENT ALLEGATIONS WERE NOT ELEVATED TO AIMS. AND CAN HELP US UNDERSTAND OF THE- WHY THOSE MANY OTHER SERIOUS ALLEGATIONS OF ABUSE ARE NOT REFERRED TO IN THE AIMS- NUMBERS AND ALL THOSE ALLEGATIONS WERE HANDLED. YES ASSEMBLY MEMBER AT LACKEY SO THE- ALLEGATIONS OF STAFF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT AND STAFF SEXUAL HARASSMENT WERE NOT INCLUDED IN THE PROCESS BECAUSE CDCR HAS IMPLEMENTED A PROCESS THAT'S CONSISTENT WITH THE FEDERAL STANDARDS FOR THE PRISON RAPE ELIMINATION ACT. AND IN THAT THERE'S PART OF THAT THAT REQUIRES AN IMMEDIATE RESPONSE SO THAT YOU CAN COLLECT ANY EVIDENCE OF THAT INCLUDES TAKING SOMEBODY OUT TO A HOSPITAL FOR A SEXUAL ASSAULT EXAM IF THE EVIDENCE. IF IT HAPPENED RECENTLY AS WELL AS GATHERING EVIDENCE THAT MIGHT EXIST MAYBE IN A HOUSING UNIT OR SOME OTHER LOCATION AND SO THAT REQUIRES AN IMMEDIATE RESPONSE AND RECOGNIZING THAT ARE AIMS PROCESS IF YOU WILL IS REGIONAL LIES WE WOULDN'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO GET THOSE PERSONS TO THE INSTITUTION AND THE TIME WE NEED. IN ORDER TO DO THAT EVIDENCE GATHERING AND GET THAT THE- INCARCERATED PERSONS AS WELL AS IN SOME CASES THE STAFF OUT FOR THESE MEDICAL EXAMINATIONS AND EVIDENCE COLLECTION. SO THE THING YOU SEE OUR HOUSE PUT A VERY THOUGHTFUL PROCESS. FOR THE PRISON RAPE ELIMINATION ACT INTO- THE EXISTING INSTITUTES ARE INTO THE INSTITUTIONS AND THAT INCLUDES VERY SPECIALIZED TRAINING FOR PERSONS INVOLVED IN THAT PROCESS FROM EVERYTHING FROM EVIDENCE COLLECTION INTO DOING THE INQUIRY'S- WE DO. GROW AND AUDITING THAT IS AT THE HIGH FEDERAL FEDERALLY CERTIFIED AUDITORS EVERY THREE YEARS AND SO THIS EXISTING PROCESS HAS GONE THROUGH- THE FEDERAL- PROCESS OF AUDITING AND HAS BEEN FOUND TO BE IN COMPLIANCE. AND SO INSTEAD OF RISKING- SPLITTING UP THAT PROCESS AND RISKING HAVING A SYSTEM THAT IS FEDERALLY COMPLIANT THE DECISION WAS MADE TO GO AHEAD AND EXCLUDE THOSE OUT AT THE BEGINNING AND CONTINUE WITH THE PROCESS THAT WE HAVE IN PLACE. ANY QUESTION. ON THE- I. G. MONITOR TEACHERS ARE FREE OF. IN REAL TIME. OKAY SO WHAT WE- UNDERSTAND THIS EVER WORRY ALLEGATION FROM BEING TO A- WHAT IS THE REVIEW. OR OTHER PASS FOR THE L. TO BE VIEW. SO IN THE PROCESS THAT EXISTS RIGHT NOW IF THE BOARD DECIDES THAT IT IT DOES NOT MEET THE CRITERIA FOR AIMS AND SO. IN THAT RESPECT IT WOULD MEAN THA THE WARDEN HAS DECIDED THAT IF TRUE ADVERSE ACTION IS NOT LIKELY THAT IT WOULD STAY WITHIN THE INTERNAL PROCESS AT THE INSTITUTION AND WOOD AND THE INCREASE WOULD BE COMPLETED BY SUPERVISORS AT THE INSTITUTION WHO HAVE BEEN TRAINED BY THE OFFICE OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS TO COMPLETE THOSE ENQUIRIES. SONY COREY STILL HAPPENS IT JUST DOESN'T HAPPEN AT THIS EXTRA UNITS. OKAY YES THIS IS BECAUSE I DON'T THINK HER RESPONSE WAS PRETTY SPECIFIC OKAY. I WANT I WANT SORRY NO GO AHEAD. OKAY AND THEN FOR THE RISON RAPE ELIMINATION ACT AND FOR THOSE INCREASED AGAIN THOSE STATE INTERNALLY AND THOSE ENQUIRIES ARE COMPLETED BY STAFF WHO HAVE TRAINING BEYOND EVEN AN- INQUIRY PROCESS PROVIDED BY THE OFFICE OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS INSTEAD IT'S TRAINING THAT'S PUT TOGETHER AND PROVIDED TO YOU. STAFF TO DO SPECIFIC PRISON RAPE ELIMINATION IN CORY'S- IT'S THE TRAININGS THAT TRAINING IS ACTUALLY PROVIDED BY OUR PRE YEAH ORDINATOR FOR THE STATE. OKAY FINALLY WE HAVE A LIST OF HOW MANY ALLEGATIONS WERE SAID TO AIMS OF THE FIGURE I HAVE BEFORE ME IS FIVE HUNDRED ONLY FIVE HUNDRED FORTY ONE. SO CAN WE IS IT POSSIBLE TO HAVE A BREAKDOWN OF HOW MANY REFER TO FROM WHICH PRISONS. BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S POSSIBLE WE MAY HAVE SOME INSTITUTIONS THAT AREN'T SENDING ALLEGATIONS. OR IS IT TOO COMPLEX AS YOU INDICATED. I KNOW IT'S NOT TOO COMPLEX WE DO HAVE THAT DATA THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT WE EVALUATED FAIRLY. EARLY ON AND HAVE IDENTIFIED CONCERNS AND PROVIDE ADDITIONAL TRAINING I WILL SAY GOING FORWARD EVERY ALLEGATION WILL GO DIRECTLY TO THE AIMS UNIT. ROTH. THANK YOU- CAN I RETURN TO THE O. I. G. AGAIN YOU LET US KNOW THAT YOU HAVE ONLY FIVE STAFF MEMBERS FOR THIS OVERSIGHT- THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION IS- RECOMMENDING THAT YOU GUYS HAD TO ADDITIONAL OVERSIGHT AND THAT WE HELP ARE YOU ASKING FOR ADDITIONAL MONIES OF US TO HELP YOU BE SUCCESSFUL WITH THAT RECOMMENDATION THAT STAFF. HAS MADE. WE WOULD NEED EXTRA WE WOULD NEED ADDITIONAL FUNDING- THE- WE WOULD HAVE TO HIRE STAFF TO DO THE OVERSIGHT THAT- WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT. THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION HERE IS THAT DO YOU OVERSEE AT LEAST ENOUGH I PROBLEMS WITH COMPLIANCE. IN A THAT THEN THE PRICE OF THE COIN CORRECTIVE ACTION DO YOU HAVE AN APPROXIMATE NUMBER OF HOW MUCH THAT YOU NEED- WITH WITH A FUNDING LEVEL MY LOOK LIKE. FIVE WE'VE WORKED THAT UP- BUT I DON'T HAVE IT. AT HAND THAT CAN PROVIDE THAT TO YOU- PROBABLY TOMORROW. THANK YOU THAT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL AND THEN I HANDED OVER TO MR JONES SAWYER. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR IN EVERYONE THAT- ST ONTO HIS HEARING AND ALL MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC THAT MAY TIME OF FOR THIS TODAY- I HAVE A- A RECOMMENDATION THAT I WOULD LIKE TO SHARE. BUT FIRST FORCE FIRST SECRETARY- CATHLEEN ALLISON- A DIFFERENT YOU KNOW THAT THAT. THE WORLD HAS CHANGED FROM WHEN YOU STARTED- MANY MEMBERS ON THIS COMMITTEE NOW HAVE TWELVE YEARS. IN THE PAST WHEN ALL THIS STARTED WE WOULD BE GONE. AND THE FRUSTRATION THAT YOU'RE FREE FEELING RIGHT NOW. IS THAT WE'VE ASKED FOR THINGS TWELVE YEARS AGO SIX YEARS AGO OR TWO YEARS AGO AND UNFORTUNATELY FOR YOU. YOUR PREDECESSOR. AS LEFT US WITH A HUGE CREDIBILITY GAP WHICH NOW FALLS ON ON YOU AND SO HOPEFULLY YOU FEEL THEIR FRUSTRATION. WITH IN IN WITH THIS COMMITTEE RIGHT NOW IN BEING ABLE TO GET ANSWERS BUT MOST IMPORTANT BEING ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD. YOU DON'T SEE A LOT WE'RE BOTH DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS. ARE KINDA UNITED IN FIXING THIS PROBLEM- AND WHEN THE BUDGET CHAIR ASK YOU WHO MAY HAVE UNDERMINED THE FORMER SECRETARY. WHEN I WAS IN YOUR OFFICE AND VISITING WITH YOU AND TALKING ABOUT WHAT YOU WANT TO DO I REMEMBER ASKING YOU WITH ANYBODY ELSE LISTENING. AND YOU LOOKED AT ME LIKE WHAT DO YOU MEAN NOT BECAUSE I REALLY FELT. THAT THE HELP OF CDCR MAY PUT OUT AN EDICT. AND I USED TO WORK IN BUREAUCRACIES BUT TO GET UNDERMINE. AT THE LOWER LEVELS AND SO THAT IS A VERY. VERY REAL AND SERIOUS THING AND SO I THE YOU GET UNDERMINE. FOUR YOU'RE MISREPRESENTING TO THIS COMMITTEE WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON AND SO I JUST WANT TO COMMEND YOU ON A BRACING THIS IDEA OF HAVING CAMERAS OF ACCOUNTABILITY OF OUR CORRECTION SYSTEMS. HOW WE ARE UTILIZING THE MINUTE FUND AND THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF NOT ONLY OUR INCARCERATED POPULATION BUT ALSO THE STAFF HAS BEEN ESPECIALLY PREVALENT AS A RESULT OF THE ONGOING HEALTH PANDEMIC BUT WHILE WE ARE HIGHLIGHTING SPECIFIC INCIDENTS TODAY DISCUSSING THE SHORTFALL THE CDC ARE IS NOTHING NEW AND IS A TOPIC WE EVERY VISIT IT YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTER YEAR. A LOT OF THE MOST RECENT- IG REPORT ON THE STAFF MISCONDUCT PROCESS ANNIE ARMSTRONG FISCALLY COURT PROCEEDINGS IT IS CLEAR WE NEED ADDITIONAL TOOLS TO BRING ABOUT MORE CONTABILIDADE TO OUR CORRECTION SYSTEM. TODAY WE WERE WE HEARD FROM THE L. I. G. OF THEIR FINDINGS REGARDING THE STAFF MISCONDUCT BUT I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO DIRECT YOUR ATTENTION TO THEIR DISCIPLINE MONITORING REPORT FROM THIS PAST YEAR. SPECIFICALLY THE REPORT NOTED INCIDENTS IN WHICH CDCR SETTLE CASES DESPITE THE O. I. G.'S RECOMMENDATION OF A HIGHER PENALTY OUTSTANDING DELAYS A DISCIPLINARY ACTION AND INVESTIGATIONS AND IN MOST. AND ALMOST HALF OF THE CASES MONITORED THE DEPARTMENT ATTORNEYS DID NOT INSURE DISCIPLINARY ACTION COMPLY WITH THAT OUR POLICY IS ENTIRELY UNACCEPTABLE. THAT AN ALREADY LIMITED BUDGET CDCR HAS WAITED OVER THREE HUNDRED AND TWELVE THOUSAND DOLLARS IN JUST SIX MONTHS BECAUSE OF DELAY DISCIPLINE. BUT EVEN MORE IMPORTANT WE SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWING INDIVIDUALS TO GET AWAY WITH GROSS ATTACKS ON VULNERABLE INCARCERATED POPULATIONS THEREFORE UNTIL WE PRIOR TO RISE THE FUNDING OF AN INDEPENDENT OVERSIGHT ENTITY WITH THE AUTHORITY TO HOLD CDC ARE COBBLES THESE ABUSES WILL CONTINUE TO HAPPEN. WHILE WE WERE MAYBE HIGHLIGHT THE STAFF MAKAN PROCESS TODAY. MEMBERS ALSO HAVING. HANDLING DISCIPLINE IN CASES WHERE FINDINGS ARE SUSTAINED AS WELL. IS FOR THESE REASONS. THAT I SUBMITTED A BUDGET REQUEST OF ELEVEN ELEVEN MILLION DOLLARS TO A QUICK THE OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL WITH THE FUNDS THEY NEED TO CARRY OUT THE VERY OVERSIGHT THEY WERE COURAGEOUS. FOUR I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING THE CONVERSATIONS WE HAVE ALREADY HAD WHAT WILL CONTINUE AT ABOUT GREATER ACCOUNTABILITY THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR FOR HOLDING THIS HEARING. HI THE- THANK YOU- I HAVE NO FURTHER QUESTIONS- I'M ABOUT TO CLOSE UP THIS PANEL I WHICH IS SAFE FOR THE DEPARTMENT- I'M GONNA TAKE YOUR BY YOUR OFFER TO WORK CLOSELY WITH YOU AND FOR YOU TO WORK WITH THE- ID TO MAKE SURE WE COULD HAVE. SOME SORT OF MOVEMENT BEFORE. MAYES OVER- IT'S FRUSTRATING TO HEAR INVESTMENT OF DOLLARS WHEN THEY'RE STILL SCARES AND HAVE A GOAL OF HAVING GOING LOWER- IT'S FRUSTRATING AND IT'S EMBARRASSING MORE THAN ANYTHING AT THE END THE DAY WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO THE STAFF WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO THE INMATES TO TREAT THEM WITH DIGNITY RESPECT TO MAKE SURE THAT BOTH ARE BEING HELD ACCOUNTABLE AND IT'S EMBARRASSING WHEN WE HAVE TELETEXT THERE'S THAT ONCE AGAIN WE HAVE FAILED THEM- AND WE HAVE FILLED IN THE WAY WE USE OUR DOLLARS SINCE I HOPE. THAT WE COULD QUICKLY WORKED COLLABORATIVELY AS A TEAM AS UNIT TO CORRECT THIS- SO THAT WE CAN START TO TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF PRIDE IN WHAT AND THIS ADDITION THAT WE HAVE OUT HERE AND SO I DO WANNA THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR TIME I NOW IN IN YOUR YOUR TIME THEN THERE WOULD HAVE TO WORK ON. THIS I'M GONNA MOVE ON TO OUR- SECOND. THE PANELISTS FOR ISSUE TWO WILL EACH PROVIDE A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF EACH OF THOSE THE PROPOSAL FOR THE STATE YOUR NAME I AND YOU CAN BEGAN I WILL TAKE QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS AFTER THE PANEL COVERS ALL THE PROPOSAL FOR. PANELIST MAY BEGIN SPEAKING IN THE ORDER LISTED IN THAT AGENDA. LET'S BEGIN. HERE GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR CAN YOU HEAR ME OK MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE YES. OKAY I MEAN RATE DOWN THE NILE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE CALIFORNIA COMMISSION ON CORRECTIONAL PEACE OFFICER STANDARDS AND TRAINING. COURSE BEFORE YOU INCLUDES FIFTY NINE POSITIONS AND FUNDING OF ONE TIME COST OF SIXTY THREE POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS SPREAD OVER THREE FISCAL YEARS AND% ONGOING FUNDING OF SIXTEEN POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS BEGINNING IN FISCAL YEAR TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE. THE FUNDING WILL SUPPORT ENHANCEMENTS TO THE BASIC CORRECTIONAL OFFICER TRAINING FOR CADETS AND NEW OFFICERS. ENTERING CDC OURS AT ALL INSTITUTIONS. THE FUNDING WILL ALSO SUPPORT STAFFING FOR DEPOSED AS THE TRAINING OVERSIGHT BODY FOR THIS DEPARTMENT. WHILE CDC ARE CURRENTLY REPORTS NEW CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS A TIME INTENSIVE BASIC ECONOMY THE PHYSICAL LOCATION LOGISTICS ASSOCIATED RESOURCES CURRENTLY LIMIT THE DEPARTMENT'S ABILITY TO DELIVER DYNAMIC AND SITUATIONALLY APPROPRIATE TRAINING. THE LEARNING ENVIRONMENT AND MODE OF DELIVERY OF TRAINING FOR THIS PROFESSION HAS NOT KEPT PACE WITH THE DEMANDS AN ESSENTIAL FUNCTIONS OF THIS JOB. THE DEGREE OF ETHICAL DECISION MAKING AND STRATEGIC COMMUNICATION IS SUCH THAT OUR-OFFICERS MUST BE TRAINED USING PROBLEM BASED TRAINING SCENARIOS AND HANDS ON APPLICATION WITHIN THE PRISON ENVIRONMENT. HISTORICALLY NEW CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS FILL SOME OF THE MOST HIGH RISK POST DUE TO THE POSTED BEEN PROCESS WHERE SENIOR OFFICERS TEND TO FORGO SOME OF THESE POSTS THAT MAY HAVE A HIGHER RATE OF STAFF INJURY. IT IS INCUMBENT UPON THE DEPARTMENT TO PREPARE STAFF BEFORE THEIR FIRST ASSIGNMENT IN THIS CHALLENGING ENVIRONMENT. THE THREE PRONGED APPROACH IN THIS PROPOSAL SERVICE TO CLOSE THE GAP BY. CONVERTING THE FORMER NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WOMEN'S FACILITY INTO AN ADVANCED DEPARTMENTAL TRAINING FACILITY TO PROVIDE NEW CADETS WITH CRITICAL REALITY BASED TRAINING. IMPLEMENTING A FOUR WEEK JOB SHADOWING PROGRAM UNDER THE OVERSIGHTOF THE FIELD TRAINING CORRECTIONAL SERGEANT. AND STAFFING SUPPOSED TO FULLY MEET THE LEGAL MANDATE OF AUDITING AND EVALUATING CORRECTIONAL PEACE OFFICER TRAINING INCLUDING SUPERVISORY AND LEADERSHIP ROLES. AS FORMATIVE CHANGES EMPHASIZE. MENTORING HM AND STAFF COMP. WHICH THE A COLD SHIFT WITHIN OUR INDUSTRY. I WILL NOW TURN IT OVER TO SARAH LARSON WHO WILL TALK ABOUT OUR TECHNOLOGY FOR INMATES PARTICIPATING IN ACADEMIC PROGRAM PROPOSAL THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH JIM RATE I'M NOT SURE CAN YOU HEAR ME OK. YES GREAT THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'M SEVERAL ARSON I'M THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR THE DIVISION OF REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS AT THE START AND AS MY COLLEAGUE MENTIONED I'M HERE TO DISCUSS A LAPTOP PROPOSAL THAT WE HAVE AND THE PROPOSAL REQUEST APPROXIMATELY TWENTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS AND FORTY THREE POSITIONS IN THE BUDGET YEAR AND EIGHTEEN MILLION DOLLARS AND THIRTY EIGHT POSSESSION. HERE'S AND ONGOING. INDUSTRY WOULD PROVIDE LAPTOPS ALL OF THE STUDENTS IN OUR DEAR PETE ARE DIVISION OF REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS PROGRAMMING. AND THAT INCLUDES OUR ACADEMIC EDUCATION LIKE LETTERS E. AND G. DEEP PROGRAMS WELL THEIR COLLEGE PROGRAMS. INCLUDE DARKER TECHNICAL EDUCATION STUDENTS OF STUDENTS- UNDERGOING JOB TRAINING PROGRAMS THE BULLETS AT STUDENTS. HER THE PEOPLE AND. HEARING AGENDA NOTES NEARLY FOUR NUMBER STOOD LACK THIRTY OR HIGH SCHOOL. AND MORE THAN FORTY SIX THOUSAND OF OUR STUDENTS NOT GET RID OF THE NINTH GRADE LEVEL IN ADDITION MANY OF OUR STUDENTS LACK BASIC COMPUTER LITERACY SKILLS WHICH HAVE BECOME A BASIC. PREREQUISITE TO MANY JOBS TODAY. THE PROPOSAL WOULD USE LAPTOPS TO SUPPORT IN CLASSROOM LEARNING WOULD HELP EXTEND LEARNING OUTSIDE OF THE CLASSROOM AND WOULD ALSO PROVIDE THE NECESSARY COMPUTER SKILLS. IN THE CLASSROOM OUR STUDENTS WOULD BE ABLE TO USE THE DEVICES TO FOCUS ON THEIR INDIVIDUAL NEEDS AND TO PROGRESS AND PRACTICE THEIR SKILLS AT THEIR OWN PACE. THEY WERE THEN ABLE TO KEEP THOSE DEVICES BACK TO THEIR HOUSING UNITS FOR WHERE THEY LIVE AND CONTINUE TO PRACTICE THEIR SKILLS AND BUILD ON THAT LEARNING THAT THEY'RE RECEIVING IN THE CLASSROOM. I'LL BE HERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THAT YOU HAVE ABOUT THE SPECIFICS OF THE PROPOSAL. BUT FOR NOW I'LL TURN IT OVER TO SHOP AROUND WHO WILL INTRODUCE OUR COULD NINETEEN WORKERS COMPENSATION. GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE CAN YOU HEAR ME. YES HI THIS IS SHEILA BROWN I'M WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION I AM A SENIOR ATTORNEY WITH THE OFFICE OF LEGAL AFFAIRS ON THE WORKERS COMPENSATION TEAM. AND UPON UNIQUEMENT OF SB ELEVEN FIFTY NINE IT SEPTEMBER TWENTY TWENTY. THE LABOR CODE WAS MODIFIED TO INCLUDE A DISPUTABLE PRESUMPTION. THAT AN EMPLOYEE'S ILLNESS OR DEATH AS A RESULT OF THE NINETEEN- ROSADO AND IN THE COURSE OF EMPLOYMENT. THIS PRESUMPTION PROVIDES FOR COMPATIBILITY UNDER WORKER'S COMPENSATION IF THE INDIVIDUAL IS A SPECIFIED OF FRONTLINE EMPLOYEE. OR IF THE PLACE OF EMPLOYMENT EXPERIENCED AN OUTBREAK OF COVER NINETEEN. IN ADDITION SB ELEVEN FIFTY NINE SHORTEN THE DETERMINATION TIMELINE FROM NINETY DAYS TO THIRTY OR FORTY FIVE DAYS. MEANING IF THE EMPLOYER DOES NOT DISPUTE THE CLAIM WITHIN THE REDUCE TIME CONSTRAINTS THEN THE ILLNESS IS PRESUMED TO BE WORK RELATED AND THE WORKERS COMPENSATION CLAIMS WILL BE ACCEPTED. AS A RESULT CDCR REQUEST FIFTY ONE MILLION IN GENERAL FUND THESE FOR TWENTY SEVEN LIMITED TERM POSITION. IN ORDER TO RESPOND TO INCREASING REPORTING REQUIREMENTS UNDER SB ELEVEN FIFTY NINE. THE BULK OF THE REQUEST IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PAY OUT OF ACCEPTED CODE NINETEEN CLAIMS. WHICH INCLUDES MEDICAL COSTS SETTLEMENT COSTS DISABILITY PAYMENTS CLAIMS MANAGEMENT AND LITIGATION. IT ALSO INCLUDES LIMITED TERM POSITION TO HANDLE THE INCREASED VOLUME OF WORKERS COMPENSATION CLAIMS RELATED TO COVER NINETEEN AND THAT THE CERTAIN TIMELINE. THESE TASKS REQUIRE SEVERAL COMPLEX AND TECHNICAL STEPS AND CONTINUOUS COORDINATION WITH THE EMPLOYEE AND THE STATE CLAIMS ADMINISTRATOR. AT THE TIME THE P. C. P. WAS DEVELOPED IN THE FALL OF TWENTY TWENTY. THIS YEAR'S DATA WAS ONLY AVAILABLE THROUGH OCTOBER TWENTY TWENTY. AND CALIFORNIA WAS APPROACHING A PROJECTED SURGE OF KOBE NINETEEN INFECTIONS. AND A VACCINE WAS ON THE HORIZON BUT IT WAS NOT YET APPROVED NOR A SCHEDULE RELEASED. SINCE THAT TIME CALIFORNIA'S INFECTIOUS NUMBERS HAVE DECLINED ALONG WITH CITIES HERE. DUE TO THE VOLATILITY OF CASE NUMBER SEEN THROUGHOUT AND THEN MAKE. CITIES ARE INCLUDED BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE WHICH PLACES THE FUNDING INTO ITS OWN LINE ITEM. APPROPRIATION FOR TRANSPARENCY. AND CAN ONLY BE SPENT FOR OVER NINETEEN WORKERS COMPENSATION CLAIMS. AND INCLUDES THE STIPULATION THAT CDCR WILL REVERT UNUSED FUNDING. TO THE GENERAL FUND IT SHOULD COVER NINETEEN CLAIMS COSTS REDUCE. I HAVE SOME DATA POINTS FOR YOU IF YOU WOULD LIKE AND JUST TO GIVE YOU SOME PERSPECTIVE. SB ELEVEN FIFTY NINE IS ACTIVE THROUGH JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY THREE. AND THIS PERIOD OF TIME COVERS- THAT THE GOVERNOR OF NEW SOME EXECUTIVE ORDER AND SIXTY TWO TWENTY WHICH COVERS FROM MARCH NINETEENTH OF TWENTY TWENTY THROUGH JULY FIFTH. OF TWENTY TWENTY AND NOW SB ELEVEN FIFTY NINE GOES FROM THAT PERIOD FORWARD. THERE'S ALSO AGAIN IT IS NOT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS AND WE HAVE HAD STAFF CLAIMS ARE CURRENTLY APPROXIMATELY. THIRTY TWO HUNDRED AND NINETY CDCR CLAIMS OUT OF A TOTAL OF SEVEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED. OR SEVEN THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY SIX STATEWIDE TOTAL CLAIMS SO CITIES ARE HAS APPROXIMATELY 45% OF THE STATEWIDE OVERALL TOTAL. CLAIMS FOR KOBE. OUR ALSO WE'RE EXPECTING THAT THERE IS A GOT AN APPROXIMATE TIMELINE OF ABOUT TWO AND A HALF TO THREE YEARS READ A HALF YEARS APPROXIMATELY. FOUR COULD BE CREATED TO BE SETTLED SO WE'VE ASKED FOR BIDS VCP TO CONTINUE THROUGH THE YEAR. TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE FISCAL YEAR THAT AS IN ORDER TO ALLOW ANY CLAIMS RECEIVED UP UNTIL THE END OF. DECEMBER TWENTY TWENTY TWO BEFORE THE EXPIRATION OF THE STATUTE. TO BE ABLE TO BE SETTLED INDICATED- THROUGHOUT THOSE FALLING TO YOUR CELL I WILL NOW OPEN IT UP FOR ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE. I THINK YOU I APPRECIATE THE ANY OF THE AND USE MONEY ADDS ABOUT WORKERS COMPENSATION. SO I DO APPRECIATE THAT THE UNUSED MONIES WILL REFER REVERT BACK TO BACK TO THE GENERAL FUND- BUT IS THERE ANY WAY TO GET US. SOME UPDATED NUMBERS YOU KNOW DURING THE SPRING SO THAT WE CAN HAVE A MORE ACCURATE. ASSESSING OF THE BUDGET PROPOSAL. ERIC SWANSON RECORD THE OFFICE OF FISCAL SERVICES BOB WE DID THE- WE DID TRY TO DO THREE THINGS I THINK THAT SHOULD A LOT OF BROUGHT UP TO. SOME TRANSPARENCY TO THIS ISSUE WE'RE NOT PLANNING ON UPDATING THE NUMBERS FOR THE SPRING PROCESS BUT- WE DO HAVE THE- RIGHT TO GET ITS OWN ITEM SO THERE COULD BE TRACKED BY EVERYBODY INVOLVED. AND WE ALSO HAVE LANGUAGE WHICH WOULD REVERTED TO THE GENERAL FUND IF IT GOES ON USE. FOR THE SERVICES SO THIS IS ALL THE INFORMATION WE'RE GOING TO GET THIS TO BE. JUST TO BE CLEAR. I THINK IN THAT TERRIBLE BECAUSE THEY OF FUNDING ITSELF IS IN IS IT A UP DATA. TRACKED BY EVERYBODY WE CAN PROVIDE REGULAR UPDATES AS FAR AS HOW MUCH HAS BEEN SPENT BUT WE'RE NOT PLANNING ON UPDATING THIS PARTICULAR- PROPOSAL GIVEN THAT MAY REVISE OKAY THANK YOU LENITION MATTER DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE YES. HI I'D LIKE TO ADD THAT ADDITIONAL SAID THAT THE TIMELINE FOR WORKERS COMPENSATION CLAIMS CAN BE VERY LONG AFTER THREE AND A HALF YEARS ON AVERAGE SO EVEN IN THE SPRING THERE'S PROBABLY NOT GOING TO BE SUFFICIENT DATA TO DO AN UPDATED PROJECTION FOR WHAT THOSE COSTS WILL BE SO IT WILL STILL. BE PREMATURE TO PROVIDE AN UPDATE. OKAY THANK YOU- FOR THE CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS TRAINING PROPOSAL. OFTEN THE CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS GET A REFRESHER TRAINING ON THE USE OF FORCE AND THE ESCALATION. HELLO ALL OFFICERS GO THROUGH TRAINING ANNUALLY ON USE OF FORCE AND- DE ESCALATION TECHNIQUES AS PART OF WHAT WE CALL ANNUAL BLOCK TRAINING. AND DO WE HAVE ANY WAY TO. HOW AN SUCCESSFUL OR IMPACTFUL BE STRAINING TO OUR. I AM CURRENTLY I THINK WE WOULD LOOK AT FOR STATISTICS- AS TO WHETHER OR NOT ANY CHANGES IN USE OF FORCE POLICY HAVE REDUCE THE NUMBER OF USE OF FORCE AND TO INSTANCES- BUT AGAIN THAT'S NOT AND DATA HAVE AVAILABLE TO YOU TODAY. SO WHEN FIX AIMS WILL HAVE A BETTER IDEA OKAY THANK YOU I DON'T HAVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. I'M SURE THIS IS YES I HAVE YOU KNOW WHAT THE AVAIL OKAY WE DID HAVE THAT- COMMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS THE CORRECTIONAL STAFF TRAINING AND JOB SHADOWING PROPOSAL WHICH WE DID NOT RAISE CONCERNS ON THE OTHER TWO PROPOSALS AS PART OF THIS ITEM BEEN. AT SO MOVING ON TO OUR COMMENTS ON THAT TRAINING PROPOSAL A STRUCTURE THEM AROUND EACH OF THE SEPARATE COMPONENTS AND THEN ONE PROVIDE ONE OVER ARCHING COMMENT SO FIRST ON THE RESOURCES REQUESTED FOR THE COMMISSION ON CORRECTIONAL PEACE OFFICER STANDARDS AND TRAINING OR SEATPOST. WE THINK THAT THE RESOURCES WOULD BETTER POSITION SUPPOSED TO FILL ITS LEGISLATIVE MANDATES AND SO WE RECOMMEND APPROVING THEM HOWEVER WE'RE CONCERNED THAT THE PROPOSAL DOESN'T FACILITATE LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT AND THAT'S BECAUSE- WHILE THE PROPOSAL WHICH PROVIDES DEPOTS WITH FUNDING TO BETTER MONITOR STAFF TRAINING AND PERFORMANCE. IT DOESN'T PLAN TO ACT IT DOESN'T INCLUDE A PLAN TO KEEP THE LEGISLATURE INFORMED OF THESE FINDINGS WE THINK THAT THIS IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT IN LIGHT OF WHAT WE HEARD IN ISSUE ONE TODAY- TO THE EXTENT THAT GAVE RECENT OUT THERE THE REPEATED ALLEGATIONS OF STAFF MISCONDUCT COULD BE TIED TO TRAINING DEFICIENCIES- SO WE RECOMMEND PASSING TRAILER BILL LEGISLATION REQUIRING SUPPOSED TO REPORT ANNUALLY TO THE LEGISLATURE BEGINNING JULY ONE TWENTY TWENTY TWO ON DATA RELEVANT TO TRAINING OUTCOMES AND CONCLUSIONS BECAUSE- DRAWS FROM THE DATA AND ANY PLANS IT HAS TO ADDRESS. THE CONCERNS. ARE CHALLENGES THAT IDENTIFIES. SECOND I WE RECOMMEND. FUND FOR THE NEW. FACILITY FOR HIM ON. FOR CORRECTION OFFICERS GIVEN THAT IT APPEARS THAT WORTHWHILE TO INSURING CORRECTIONAL CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS ARE SUFFICIENTLY. PREPARED TO BEGIN WORKING. THIRD WE THINK THAT THE IDEA OF THE JOB SHADOWING PROGRAM SIMILARLY SEEMS WORTHWHILE BUT WE DO HAVE CONCERNS WITH THAT TWO OF THE RESOURCE AS REQUESTED TO SUPPORT IT- SO FIRST THE THIRTY THREE SERGEANT POSITIONS REQUESTED. BY THE PROGRAM SEVENTEEN OF THOSE POSITIONS ARE DRIVEN BY WORKLOAD THAT'S NEW AND ASSOCIATED WITH THE JOB SHADOWING PROGRAM. HOWEVER THE REMAINING SIXTEEN POSITIONS ARE INTENDED TO RELIEVE EXISTING STAFF OF CERTAIN TASKS SUCH AS MAINTAINING FITNESS EQUIPMENT TESTING EQUIPMENT SO THAT THE OTHER- EXISTING STAFF ARE SO THAT THOSE EXISTING BACK INSTEAD FOCUS ON OTHER ACTIVITIES. LIKE SCHEDULING STAFF FOR THEIR ANNUAL TRAININGS THAT THE DEPARTMENT REPORTS ARE NOT GETTING DONE IN A TIMELY MANNER BUT THE DEPARTMENT HASN'T BEEN ABLE TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE INFORMATION ON THE EXTENT THAT THOSE TASKS AREN'T. EVEN BEING- COMPLETED IN A TIMELY MANNER- IN OTHER WORDS- THE DEPARTMENT HAD AT PROVIDED DETAILED ANALYSIS ON- CURRENT WORKLOAD AND THE NUMBER OF POSITIONS THAT WOULD BE REQUIRED TO COMPLETE IN A TIMELY MANNER. SO WE RECOMMEND AT REJECTING SIXTEEN POSITIONS THAT AREN'T TIED DIRECTLY TO THE NEW JOB TRAINING PROGRAM WHICH WOULD REDUCE THE FUNDING NEEDED BY TWO POINT SEVEN MILLION ANNUALLY. AND THE SECOND RESOURCE THAT- WE HAVE CONCERNED WITH THAT'S REQUESTED FOR THE NEW JOB SHATTERING PROGRAM IS THATYOU SIX POINT TWO MILLION TO PAY NEW OFFICERS WHILE THEY'RE DOING THE JOB SHADOWING- AND THE REASON WE ARE CONCERNED WITH THAT IT'S SIMPLY THAT THE FUNDING AMOUNT AS SOON. ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED AND EIGHTY NEW OFFICERS PER YEAR BUT CDC ARE A SINCE REVISED THAT ESTIMATE TWO ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND SIXTY SIX NEW OFFICERS IN THE BUDGET YEAR. SO WHAT WE RECOMMEND REDUCING THE FUNDING ACCORDINGLY- WHICH WOULD BE BY ONE POINT FOUR MILLION. AND FOR- OVER ARCHING COMMENT IS THAT PRISON CLOSURES WILL REDUCE FUTURE NEED FOR CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS. AND THAT'S BECAUSE WHEN PRISONS ARE CLOSE OFFICERS AT THOSE PRESENTS CAN. HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO MOVE ELSEWHERE IN THE STATE TO FILL VACANCIES AT THE REMAINING PRESENTS. REDUCING THE NEED FOR NEW OFFICERS- TO BE PRODUCED. BY THE ACADEMY. SO WHILE HISTORICALLY THAT THE NEED FOR DOCTORS HAVE BEEN FAIRLY CONSISTENT FROM YEAR TO YEAR- MEANING AND AS A RESULT CDCR BUDGET. ISN'T ADJUSTED ANNUALLY TO ACCOUNT FOR CHANGES IN THE NUMBER OF OFFICERS NEW OFFICERS AT NEEDS TO PRODUCE- HOWEVER. GIVEN PRISON CLOSURES ON THE HORIZON- CTC ARTS. BASED BUDGET FOR THE PROPER TRAINING AS WELL AS THE PERFECT PROPOSALS BEFORE YOU TODAY- ADVOCATES OFFICER TRAINING- PROGRAM. COULD BECOME EXCESSIVE SO WE RECOMMEND PASSING BUDGET TRAILER LEGISLATION REQUIRING THE ADMINISTRATION TO PROPOSE. ADJUSTMENTS THE CITY'S AIRSPACE BUDGET FOR TRAINING NEW CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS ON AN ANNUAL BASIS- THIS WOULD BE SIMILAR TO HOW OTHER AREAS OF CITIES YEAR'S BUDGET ARE CURRENTLY. ADJUSTED ANNUALLY. BASED ON VARIOUS FACTORS LIKE. THE NUMBER OF INMATES ARE PAROLEES. THANK YOU. THANK YOU THE THREE TO FIND SEVENTY TO ADD LIVE NATION UNDER DEPART OF FAINTING THANK YOU MATT AND- OUT WE DO NOT RELATED TO THE RIVER ON THE OUT WE DO NOT IT'S NECESSARY. TO PUT IT INTO TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE BUT WE RESPECT THE LEGISLATURE. FOR INFORMATION AND WERE OPEN TO DISCUSSING IDEAS REGARDING USEFUL REPORTING METRICS WE WOULD WANT TO EVALUATE WHAT REPORTING THAT DEPARTMENT CURRENTLY DOES AS WELL AS ANY POTENTIAL FISCAL IMPACTS OF PROPOSED REPORTING ALTERNATELY CCAR'S COMMITTED TO THE SUCCESS OF IMPLEMENTING THEIR ADDITIONAL TRADING RESOURCES- AND ALSO IN RESPONSE TO THE SERGEANTS FOR THE JOB SHATTERING. IT WE BELIEVE IT'S CRITICAL TO HAVE A SERGEANT AT EACH INSTITUTION DEDICATED TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS PROGRAM INSTITUTIONS HAVE DIFFERENT MISSIONS DIFFERENTLY OUT INMATE POPULATIONS AND OTHER UNIQUE ATTRIBUTES AND IT'S REALLY CRITICAL THAT THE STAFF WHO OVERSEE THE JOB SHADOWING PROGRAM ARE WELL VERSED IN THE SPECIFICS OF THEIR INSTITUTION. THAT WAY THE CRIMINAL OFFICERS CAN RECEIVE SITE SPECIFIC TRAINING ADDITIONALLY THE SERGEANTS SERGEANTS WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR WORKING WITH THE CURRENT POSTED STAFF WHO WILL BE ACTUALLY DOING THEIR JOB SHADOWING AT TO MAKE SURE IT'S INFORMATIVE AFFECTED MAXIMIZES THE.NEW OFFICERS LEARNING EXPERIENCE. APOSTLES THAT CONTINUED I. TO ENSURE THE IT'S IN PLACE ARE CARP TRAINED FROM DEFEAT IT WILL INCREASE ACCOUNT. BY MAKING. THE NEW OXFORD. AFTER MEETING WITH. AND IN OUR TO THE AREA ADJUSTMENT FOR THE ACADEMY OUT WE DON'T BELIEVE IT WE BELIEVE IT'S PREMATURE TO CONSIDER THIS TYPE OF AN ADJUSTMENT THERE'S STILL NUMEROUS UNKNOWNS IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE WHICH MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE OFFICER NEEDED LONG TERM FUTURE ATTRITION RATE IS BASED ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS INCLUDING THE EFFECTS OF COCAINE SALARY AND BENEFIT COMPENSATION AND THE EFFECTS OF PRESIDENT BUSH OR EVEN IF THERE IS REDUCING IT TEMPORARILY. THERE WILL BE CONTINUED RETIREMENTS WHICH WOULD NECESSITATE OFFICERS ARE WILLING WE BELIEVE IT ARE STILL PREMATURE TO IT SURE DOES THAT THIS ISSUE ABOUT THE ADMINISTRATION WILL CONSIDER CONSOLIDATION. WHEN IT'S APPROPRIATE. THANK YOU. OKAY WE ARE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND OPEN IT FOR PUBLIC COMMENT. I WANT TO THANK EVERYONE IS IMPATIENTLY WAITING.
