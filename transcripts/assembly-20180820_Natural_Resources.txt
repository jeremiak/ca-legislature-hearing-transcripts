TO AS A SUBCOMMITTEE -- ONE OF WELCOME ISRAEL'S -- TO PRESENT HERE RESOLUTION. THANK IT WOULD ALSO LIKE TO THANK MY JOINT AUTHORED. OKAY I DIDN'T HAVE HER ON MY MEMO HERE THAT'S A WELCOME IS BAKER THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN HEARING. CHAIR AND MEMBERS I WOULD LIKE TO START BY ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS REFERENCED ON PAGE THREE OF THE ANALYSIS. WASHINGTON DC HAS EMBARKED ON A POORLY CRAFTED STRATEGY TO ROLL BACK THE PROGRESS WE'VE MADE TO CLEAN OUR AIR. FOR OVER FORTY YEARS CALIFORNIA HAS LED THE NATION COMBATING AUTOMOTIVE EMISSIONS VIA BIPARTISAN EFFORTS TO ESTABLISH STANDARDS. THAT HAVE STE THAT HAVE SERVED AS A MODEL FOR THE NATION AND THE WORLD. THE ILL CONCEIVED PLAN FROM THE NATIONAL HIGHWAY. AND WILL NOT JUST INCREASE HER POLICE MISSIONS BUT WILL COST CONSUMERS MORE. THE GAS PUMP. MUST BE STOPPED. CALIFORNIA'S AUTOMOTIVE POLLUTION STANDARDS RATHER THAN BE A BURDEN. HAVE PUSHED AND ACCELERATED INNOVATION IN THE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY. OUR MODERN CARS PRODUCE FEWER ADMISSIONS AND HAVE INCREASED GAS MILEAGE WITHOUT COMPROMISING PERFORMANCE. IN FACT MODERN CARS AND TRUCKS PRODUCE MORE HORSEPOWER. THAN EVER BEFORE WITH LESS DISPLACEMENT AND FUEL CONSUMPTION THEN IT AT ANY OTHER TIME IN HISTORY. WITHDRAWING CALIFORNIA'S WAIVER AND FREEZING THE FUEL ECONOMY IN GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION STANDARDS. WILL HAVE A DRASTIC NEGATIVE IMPACT ON PUBLIC HEALTH. AND CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY AS WELL. POTENTIALLY COSTING THE STATE THIRTY SIX BILLION DOLLARS IN COSTS. OVER THE NEXT DECADE. SUPPORTING AJ OUR FIFTY IS A VOTE FOR SCIENCE AND CONTINUE DEVELOPMENT OF TECHNOLOGIES. ATTACKED OUR AIR WITHOUT COMPROMISING CONSUMER CHOICE. WITH ME TO SPEAK ON THIS RESOLUTION. IS ONE OF THE JOINT AUTHORS MY COLLEAGUE ASSEMBLY MEMBER BAKER. FROM THE CITY OF DUBLIN ERIC AND HIS BAKER BEFORE YOU GO ON PROCEED FURTHER ELECTED STEPS QUORUM. AND I'M SECTOR PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. ASSEMBLYMEMBERS MEANT TO CHAIR REFUGEE HERE ACOSTA HERE ACOSTA HERE CHAU. CHOW HERE EGGMAN. EGGMAN HERE FLORA. FLORA HERE IN LIMON. MCCARTY. MELENDEZ STONE [inaudible] STONE HERE. ALRIGHT WE HAVE QUORUM THANK. THIS BAKER THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS AFTER A LONG DAY VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR CONSIDERATION I REALLY WOULD LIKE TO THANK -- ART JOINT AUTHORED ASSEMBLY MEMORY AS A FEW WEEKS AGO WE BOTH INTRODUCED MEASURES TO STAND UP FOR CALIFORNIA GETTING TO KEEP ITS WAVER FROM THE CLEAN AIR ACT AND CONTINUE -- TO SET STANDARDS THAT THEY FELT THAT WE BELIEVE ARE CORRECTED DETERMINE OUR OWN FATE AND OUR OWN FUTURE WHEN IT COMES TO FUEL EFFICIENCY AND EMISSION STANDARDS. AND I THINK THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW INSTEAD OF COMPETING WITH ONE ANOTHER WE CAN ACTUALLY COME TOGETHER AND SET. NOT ONLY GOOD POLICY BUT HAVE A MUCH STRONGER VOICE BY WORKING TOGETHER SO I VERY MUCH WANT TO THANK THE JOINT AUTHOR OF FOR HER LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE AS SHE HAS OF MANY OTHER ISSUES RELATED TO THE ENVIRONMENT. BAD LIKE TO UNDERSCORE A COUPLE OF KEY POINTS ABOUT THIS WAIVER AND THIS RESOLUTION. THE WAIVER WAS FIRST INTRODUCED IN FIRST REQUESTED. DECADES AGO BY THEN GOVERNOR RONALD REAGAN. JOINT AGENCY. THEY OF ARMENIA PROTECTION AGENCY THAT WAS STARTED BY PRESIDENT NIXON. AND IT HAS BEEN APPROVED OVER A HUNDRED AND THIRTY TIMES IN FIVE DECADES. AS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS AGAIN AND AGAIN CHOSEN TO SET ITS OWN FATE AND OWN STANDARDS THAT LEAD NOT ONLY THE NATION AND THE WORLD. SO I UNDERSCORE FOR YOU THE BIPARTISAN NATURE OF PROTECTING OUR ENVIRONMENT. FUEL EFFICIENCY STANDARDS AND OUR MISSION STANDARDS AND WHY WE SO VERY MUCH PARTICULARLY AT THIS TIME NEED TO CONSIDER CONTINUE THAT EXAMPLE. SECONDLY AS MIKE ARE GOOD CALLING GIVES HAS POINTED OUT THE EFFECTS THAT THE FUEL EFFICIENCY STANDARDS A CALIFORNIA SAID HAVE ON OUR ENVIRONMENT WE MUST CONTINUE TO DO THEM. THEY HAVE PROVEN TO HAVE AN EFFECT NOT ONLY IN CALIFORNIA BUT NATIONWIDE AND ACROSS I THINK THE WORLD. BUT THERE'S ALSO ANOTHER COMPONENT TO THIS SAID I WANNA MAKE SURE WE DON'T FORGET AND THAT IS WHEN WE HAVE PROMOTED MORE FUEL EFFICIENT VEHICLES AND OUR STANDARDS WE HAVE ACTUALLY INCREASED THE AFFORDABILITY. AND ACCESS TO TRANSPORTATION AND MOBILITY FOR CALIFORNIANS THERE'S A LOT THAT HAPPENS IN CALIFORNIA THAT MAKES LIFE LESS AFFORDABLE. FOR OUR CONSTITUENTS THIS IS ONE OF THOSE MEASURES THAT WHEN WE STAND UP FOR FUEL EFFICIENCY STANDARDS AND THE WORK THAT CALIFORNIA HAS DONE THAT ISN'T ALLOWED TO OUR CONSTITUENTS TO GET GREATER. DISTANCES GREATER MOBILITY A WITH MANY REASONS WHY I HOPE YOU WILL SUPPORT THIS RESOLUTION. I'M AND FINALLY I WANT TO UNDERSCORE THATWE'RE NOT ASKING FOR A NEW WAY. FOR THIS IS A WAIVER THAT WAS ALREADY GRANTED WITH BIPARTISAN SUPPORT AS AGAIN A HUNDRED AND THIRTY WAIVERS HAVE BEEN IN THE PAST. WE'RE NOT ASKING FOR SPECIAL TREATMENT -- TO MAKE SURE WE GET A WHOLE BRAND NEW WAVER WE ALREADY HAVE ONE WE SECURED IT WE'VE BEEN PLANNING AND GOING FORWARD WITH THAT. ALL WE'RE ASKING IS THAT WE GET TO CONTINUE UNDER THE FRANKLIN OF THE PRINCIPLE OF FEDERALISM THAT STARTED IN OUR OUR COUNTRY'S CONSTITUTION TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE THAT WAIVER. AND SO -- AGAIN I WANT TO THANK OUR MIKE VERY GOOD COLLEAGUE THE ADDITIONAL CO AUTHORS OF THE LEGISLATION FOR THE BIPARTISAN VOICE THAT IS SO MUCH STRONGER FOR THE COLLABORATION FOR THE ENVIRONMENT AND FOR OUR CONSTITUENTS. RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU ARE FOR THE BIPARTISAN PRESENTATION -- ON DO WE HAVE A WITNESS IN SUPPORT YES YOU CAN NOW KEEP A BRIEF RUPERT PRITCHETT.
