WELCOME TO ASSEMBLY JUDICIARY WE'RE GOING TO START AS A SUBCOMMITTEE. NORMALLY I WOULD NOT DO THAT WITHOUT AT LEAST ONE REPUBLICAN MEMBER BUT WE SEEM TO BE. LACKING THEM THIS MORNING WE NEED TO GET THIS MEETING GOING WE'RE GONNA TAKE MISTER TO FIRST SO WE'LL START WITH. ITEM NUMBER TWO AB TWO OF SIX THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. THIS BILL CONCERNS THE SUBJECT OF A LANDMARK JUDGMENT THAT DEFINITIVELY HELD LEAD PAINT MANUFACTURERS TO HAVE KNOWINGLY SOLD A PRODUCT THAT THEY KNEW WAS HARMFUL TO PROPERTY OWNERS -- THEY'RE FOUND GUILTY BECAUSE OF THEIR ADVERTISING IN THE FACE OF THIS KNOWLEDGE VERTICALLY AROUND HEALTH RISKS THERE WERE DOCUMENTED INVOLVING BRAIN DAMAGE KIDNEY DAMAGE INFERTILITY AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISORDERS IN CHILDREN. TEN CITIES AND COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA SUCCESSFULLY SUED THREE LEAD PAINT COMPANIES AND PROVE THAT THE COMPANY'S NEGLIGENCE CREATED A WIDESPREAD PUBLIC NUISANCE WHICH THE COMPANIES MUST PAY TO ABATE. OUR BILL AB TWO OH SIX WOULD PROTECT PROPERTY OWNERS FROM FRIVOLOUS LAWSUITS THAT HAVE BEEN THREATENED BY THE PAIN COMPANIES IF. A HOMEOWNER OR A PROPERTY OWNER PARTICIPATES IN A LEAD PAINT ABATEMENT PROGRAM. ANY OWNER WHO DOES THE RIGHT THING AND REMOVES LED FROM THEIR HOME SHOULD NOT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THE THREAT OF MERITLESS LAWSUITS FROM THESE PAIN COMPANIES. BEYOND THE THREAT OF LAWSUITS NUMEROUS MULTI FAMILY DWELLING OWNERS ACROSS CALIFORNIA WOULD NOT HAVE TO CSUS SEEK TO HAVE NOT MAY NOT BE SEEKING TO HAVE KNOWN LEAD PAINT DEBATED. TO ENSURE THAT ALL PROPERTY OWNERS WITH POTENTIAL HAZARDS PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM THIS BILL NARROWLY PROVIDES THAT VOLUNTARY PARTICIPATION IN THE PROGRAM ALONE CANNOT BE USED TO PROVE THAT A PROPERTY IS A NUISANCE OR OTHERWISE UNTENABLE. WE WANT AS MANY HOMEOWNERS AS POSSIBLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THESE PROGRAMS AND GET LET OUT OF THEIR HOMES THIS IS A BILL THAT'S NECESSARY TO IMPLEMENT THE COURT'S JUDGMENT EFFECTIVELY. AND MAXIMIZE THE USE OF THESE PROGRAMS WITHOUT FEELING DELAY WHO IS A DEPUTY ATTORNEY WITH THE SAN FRANCISCO CITY ATTORNEY'S OFFICE AS WELL AS DIFFICULT AND WITH THE CALIFORNIA APARTMENT ASSOCIATION. FIRST WITH US PLEASE. HELLO THANK YOU AND CHAIRMAN STONE FOR HANG US TODAY. AB TWO OH SIX IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE LEAD PAINT LITIGATION THAT WE'VE BEEN LITIGATING FOR NEARLY TWO DECADES HAS RESULTED IN A FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR JUDGMENT THE PROVIDES A ONCE IN A GENERATION OPPORTUNITY. FOR TEN JURISDICTIONS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA TO REMOVE THE PUBLIC NUISANCE OF INTERIOR RESIDENTIAL LEAD PAINT FROM HOMES LEAD PAINT THE CONTINUES TO POISON THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS CHILDREN EVERY YEAR. ONE OF THE UNIQUE ASPECTS OF OUR JUDGMENT HOWEVER IS THAT WE HAVE ONLY FOUR YEARS IN ORDER TO GET THIS FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OF ABATEMENT COMPLETED. AND THAT ANY MONEY THAT REMAINS IN THE FUND THAT THE LEAD PAINT COMPANIES HAVE TO PAY INTO WILL REVERT BACK TO THEM AT THE END OF FOUR YEARS. THIS PROVIDES AN INCENTIVE TO THE LEAD PAINT COMPANIES -- TO DISCOURAGE PEOPLE FROM PARTICIPATING IN THE VOLUNTARY PROGRAM AND THEY'VE MADE VERY CLEAR ON THE RECORD IN OPEN COURT THAT THEY PLAN. TO SCARE PEOPLE OFF FROM PARTICIPATING IN THIS VOLUNTARY PROGRAM BY THREATENING TO SUE THEM EVEN THOUGH THOSE CLAIMS IT MAY NOT BE PARTICULARLY STRONG. OR HAVE ANY MERIT AT ALL. IN ORDER TO PROTECT HOMEOWNERS TO GIVE THEM THE COMFORT THAT THEY NEED TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS PROGRAM TO TAKE THE ACTION THAT'S BEST FOR THEIR FAMILIES TO REMOVE LEAD PAINT. AND PROTECT THEIR CHILDREN AND CALIFORNIA'S CHILDREN IN OUR HOUSING STOCK GOING FORWARD WE NEED TO ASSURE THEM THAT THEY WILL NOT FACE THESE MERITLESS BUT NEVER THE LESS SCARY AND EXPENSIVE LAWSUITS IF THEY DO PARTICIPATE. SIMILARLY WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT. HARTMAN THE OWNERS AND OWNERS OF MULTI UNIT DWELLINGS WILL FEEL COMFORTABLE PARTICIPATING IN THE PROGRAM. KNOWING THAT THEIR MERE PARTICIPATION IN THE PROGRAM WON'T. BE EVIDENCE OF A NEW SENSE IN AND OF ITSELF -- THAT THEY WILL ONLY BE RESPONSIVE. ANY PROBLEMS THAT THEY DON'T FIX RATHER THAN FOR TAKING THESE POSITIVE ACTIONS TO FIX. A PROBLEM THAT'S BEEN PLAGUING CALIFORNIA FOR GENERATIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU THAT'S WITH US PLEASE GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I DEBRA CARLTON WITH THE CALIFORNIA APARTMENT ASSOCIATION WE REPRESENT APPROXIMATELY FIFTY THOUSAND RENTAL PROPERTY OWNERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. TOGETHER THEY OPERATE ABOUT TWO MILLION RENTAL UNITS THE PROTECTIONS OFFERED HERE UNDER AB TWO OH SIX WELL ENCOURAGE PROPERTY OWNERS TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM. YOU KNOW IT'S UNLIKELY THAT PROPERTY OWNERS WHO PURCHASED AND APPLIED LEAD PAINT IN THE NINETEEN FIFTIES OR EVEN A LIVE TODAY -- AND YET THE OWNERS THAT OWN THE HOUSING NOW ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING AND OR ABATING THE LEADPAINT. WE WANT TO MAKE CLEAR HOWEVER THAT THE BILL DOES NOT CHANGE THE EXISTING LAW AS IT RELATES TO MAINTENANCE AND HABITABILITY AND SUBSTANDARD CONDITIONS -- PROPERTY OWNERS OF COURSE -- FACE INCREASED A MAINTENANCE COSTS FOR MAINTAINING LEAD PAINT IN PLACE -- BUT THEY WILL. STILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR SUB STANDARD CONDITIONS THIS BILL DOES NOT CHANGE THAT IT DOES NOT CHANGE THE LAW AS IT RELATES -- TO IF A CHILD IS POISONED THE RENTAL PROPERTY OWNER WOULD STILL BE HELD RESPONSIBLE SO FOR THAT -- WE ENCOURAGE YOUR THANK YOU WE'RE GOING TO PAUSE AND ESTABLISH A QUORUM CALL THE ROLL PLEASE STONE HERE GALLAGHER. CHAU. CHIU. CAN SALAS HOLDEN KALRA. KILEY MAIENSCHEIN OBERNOLTE NORRIS PRESS. WE DO HAVE A CORE. THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. IF YOU COULD GIVE US YOUR NAME AND YOUR AFFILIATION PLEASE. AND A BUCK ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS IN SUPPORT WE LIKE TO THINK THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER FOR HIS TENACITY IN BRINGING BACK THIS BILL IDEA THIS YEAR. AND ALSO THE FURTHER REFINEMENTS TO LANGUAGE THAT ARE BENEFICIAL TO HOMEOWNERS THANK YOU. MORNING A COMING WITH LA COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS AND STRONG SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING MR TEAR MEMBERS JEAN HEARST HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE VENTURA COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS AND SUPPORT -- MICHAEL RIGHT AGAIN ON BEHALF OF THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS SANTA CLARA COUNTY AND STRONG SUPPORT. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. I'D SAY NOT AS OUR OPPOSITION GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE JOHN MOFFITT ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIANS FOR SAFE AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING -- WHICH IS A PROJECT OF CONAGRA ENSURE WILLIAMS TO THE THREE DEFENDANTS IN THE UNDERLYING CASE. AS OUR LETTER TO THE COMMITTEE NOTED WERE WERE OPPOSED TO THE BILL AND I THINK FOR THE THE PURPOSES OF OF TODAY'S DISCUSSION TODAY I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS TO KNOW WHO IS BEING PROTECTED HERE. WHO THIS BILL SEEKS TO PROTECT AGAINST LAWSUITS BY US? AND WHO IT SEEKS TO REMOVE. FROM FOR THE PURPOSES OF TENANTS RIGHTS IN THERE AT THE VEIL ABILITY TO EVIDENCE IN BRINGING THEIR OWN LAWSUITS. YOU KNOW THE THE SECTION EIGHT OF THE BILL IS IS ABOUT LAWSUITS BY MY CLIENTS -- THAT WERE GRANTED IN THE APPELLATE COURT DECISION EXPRESSLY GRANTED IN THAT DECISION AND AFTER TWENTY YEARS OF LITIGATION. THE COURT WENT THROUGH AND EXERCISED ITS JUDGMENT IN BALANCING THE EQUITIES AS WHAT IS WHAT HAPPENS IN. IN EQUITY CASES IN TORT CASES AND THEY SAID LOOK. MY CLIENTS ARE LIABLE AND THEY'REGOING TO PAY MONEY INTO A FUND. BUT THEY ALSO RECOGNIZED EXISTING CALIFORNIA LAW. AND THIS IS LAW THAT SEPARATE FROM THIS CASE EXISTING CALIFORNIA LAW ON THE HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE. REQUIRES A A HOMEOWNER AND A LANDLORD TO MAINTAIN THEIR HOMES. IN IN IN AN APPROPRIATE CONDITION WITH RESPECT TO LEAD BASED PAINT IF IT'S INTACT IT'S NOT A LEAD HAZARD. IF IT'S DETERIORATED IT'S A LEAD HAZARD AND THEY HAVE AN EXISTING OBLIGATION RIGHT NOW ASIDE FROM THIS CASE AND THIS PROGRAM. TO FIX IT AND CLEAN IT UP THIS BILL. AND THE COURT IN THE APPELLATE COURT DECISION BASICALLY SAID. WHEN WE RAISED AN ISSUE WITH RESPECT TO OUR DUE PROCESS RIGHTS IN THE TRIAL COURT? SAID YOU'RE DUE PROCESS HAS NOT BEEN VIOLATED BECAUSE AT THE END OF THIS PROCESS. YES THERE'S GOING TO BE A BALANCING HERE. AND A LANDLORD WHO HAS NOT FOLLOWED CALIFORNIA LAW WHO IS NOT MAINTAINED LEAD PAINT HOME WHO IS LET IT DETERIORATE MIGHT ALSO BE RESPONSIBLE. AND YOU GET TO BRING A LAWSUIT TO SEE CONTRIBUTION. THIS BILL TAKES THAT AWAY IN DOING SO IT CLEARLY VIOLATES OUR DUE PROCESS RIGHTS GRANTED BY THE APPELLATE COURT. AND THE EFFECT OF THAT COULD RESULT IN A RE OPENING OF THE CASE BECAUSE THE CASE WAS BUILT ON A BALANCING OF NOW THE EQUITIES OF THIS BILL WERE TO BECOME LAW ARE OFF. WITH RESPECT TO TENANTS. THIS BILL TAKES AWAY THEIR RIGHT TO A KEY PIECE OF EVIDENCE. THAT THEY MIGHT USE TO BRING -- A A A LAWSUIT AGAINST A LANDLORD WHO HAS NOT FOLLOWED THE LAW. IN BOTH OF THESE CASES IN THE LAWSUITS BY MY CLIENTS IN A LAWSUIT BY A TENANT. LANDLORDS AND HOMEOWNERS WHO HAVE FOLLOWED THE LAW HAVE NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT. THEY DON'T NEED THIS BILL. THIS BILL IS NEEDED BY LANDLORDS. WHO HAVE NOT FOLLOWED THE LAW AND MY GUESS IS THAT'S PROBABLY A PRETTY SMALL CHUNK OF THE FOLKS WHO WHO THE APARTMENT ASSOCIATION REPRESENTS? BUT THESE ARE THE WORST OF THE WORST. ACTION A REMOVES THEIR RESPONSIBILITY TO CONTRIBUTE AFTER COLLECTING. MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN RENT. FOR WHO KNOWS HOW MANY YEARS. IT REMOVES THEIR RESPONSIBILITY TO CONTRIBUTE TO CLEANING UP LEAD BASED PAINT. AND THEN IT REMOVES THE TENANTS ABILITY TO ACCESS WHAT MIGHT BE THE ONLY EVIDENCE LEFT. IF THEY WANT TO BRING A LAWSUIT AGAINST THEIR LANDLORD BECAUSE THE LANDLORD BROKE EXISTING CALIFORNIA LAW. FOR ALL OF THESE REASONS WE WE ARE OPPOSED TO THE BILL. AND WE ASK FOR YOUR NO VOTE. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. ALL RIGHT SING NONE I'M GONNA BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE THE CITY ON A THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE LEARNED. LAST YEAR THROUGH THE BALLOT INITIATIVE PROCESS THE HEARINGS YOUR COMMITTEE AND THIS COMMITTEE WERE A PART OF WAS THAT THAT PAIN COMPANIES. HAVE THIS. INCLINATION TO WANT TO PASS BLAME AND PASS RESPONSIBILITY THEY TRY TO PASS IT LAST YEAR. TO THE TAXPAYERS A CALIFORNIA. NOW I AM CONCERNED AND I SHARE YOUR CONCERN THAT THEY'RE TRYING TO PASS IT OFF TO OTHER FOLKS AND GIVE AND DISINGENUOUS PROPAGANDA. THAT WAS. SENT AROUND LAST YEAR ABOUT WHAT THE ACTIONS THAT THIS LEGISLATURE WAS TRYING TO DO. I THINK THE CREDIBILITY OF THE PAIN COMPANIES HERE AND THEIR WILLINGNESS TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PROCESS AND TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE DAMAGE TO THE BECAUSE THE CERTAINLY IN QUESTION. SO THAT'S WHY THIS BILL. ENJOY THE AND I RECOMMENDATION OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM. COMMITTEE MEMBERS. SCOUTER. SOME I GUESS I DO KIND OF STRUGGLE AT THIS BILL LITTLE BIT AYE AYE. ON THE ONE HAND. FEEL LIKE THIS WOULD LEAD -- TO INCENTIVIZE MORE CLEAN UP WHICH I KNOW WE WE DO NEED AND YOU KNOW THIS. HAVING THIS IN PLACE WOULD. I THINK INCENTIVIZE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO MAY BE DO HAVE ISSUES WITH LEAD PAINT OR POTENTIALLY COULD HAVE ISSUES WITH LEAD PAINT. TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS PROGRAM DO ABATEMENT AND THEN ALSO GET SOME LIABILITY PROTECTION -- IN THE PROCESS -- I ALSO THINK THAT YOU KNOW. PROBABLY MOST PEOPLE WHO APPLIED LEAD LEAD BASED PAINT IN THEIR APARTMENTS -- PROBABLY AT THE TIME HAD NO IDEA THAT THIS WAS SOMETHING THAT. COULD BE HARMFUL AT THE TIME AND PROBABLY THE MANUFACTURE WAS IN A BETTER PLACE. TO BE THE DETERMINER OR MAYBE HAVE THE KNOWLEDGE. OF THOSE TYPE OF OF OF THE FAX SO. YOU KNOW IT. IT DOES SEEM TO ME THAT YOU YOU KNOW YOU'D PUT MORE RESPONSIBILITY UPON THE MANUFACTURE AND THOSE TYPE OF SITUATIONS -- HOWEVER I MEAN I DO THINK MISTER MOFFETT MAKES A GOOD POINT THAT -- YOU KNOW THERE IS EXISTING LAW. WITH REGARD TO LEAD BASED PAINT THAT EVERYBODY AT LEAST NOW AND IN MODERN TIMES KNOWS ABOUT THAT YOU DO HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT. A DETERIORATING -- PAINT -- AND ARE WE BY THIS BILL -- SOMEHOW KIND OF RELIEVING THEM OF THE OF THE LANDLORD OF THEIR RESPONSIBILITY TO DEAL WITH THOSE -- TYPE OF ISSUES EVEN THOUGH THAT THEY PROBABLY DID NOT KNOW OF IT WHEN THE PAINT WAS APPLIED AND YOU KNOW MANY YEARS LATER. ARE ARE NOW HAVING TO DEAL WITH THIS ISSUE. THERE STILL IS A LEGAL RESPONSIBILITY CAN YOU MAYBE SPEAK TO THAT MR CHIU AND LIKE. I MEAN DO YOU BELIEVE IT IS. HOW WOULD YOU RESPOND TO THAT I GUESS PROJECT? PROJECT THE QUESTION AND I KNOW MISTER GALLAGHER YOU ARE NOT ON COMMITTEE LAST YEAR WHEN THIS COMMITTEE CONSIDER THIS NOW JUST NOTE. THIS COMMITTEE SUPPORTED THIS BILL. TEND. TO ZERO IN A BIPARTISAN FASHION AFTER HEARING A WAY IN ALL THE ARGUMENTS AND IT ACTUALLY WENT THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE WENT TO THE ASSEMBLY -- IT WAS VOTED ON UNANIMOUSLY IN A BIPARTISAN WAY OFF THE SOME AND I THINK YOU REMEMBER THAT. AND I WILL MENTION THAT LAST FROM COMMITTEE THE OPPOSITION DID NOT RAISE ANY OF THESE ISSUES AS THIS BILL WENT THROUGH -- BUT TAKE TO GET YOUR POINT AS THE EVIDENCE CLEARLY SHOW DURING TWENTY YEARS OF LITIGATION -- CONSUMERS TO HAD NO IDEA WHAT WAS THE MANUFACTURERS WHO HID THAT EVIDENCE FOR MANY MANY DECADES AND IT FINALLY ALL CAME TO LIGHT BECAUSE OF THIS LAWSUIT. I ALSO WOULD POINT TO THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS WHICH IS VERY THOROUGH WHICH STATES. THAT PROTECTING PROPERTY OWNERS FROM LIABILITY DOESN'T LIMIT LEGITIMATE OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE PAIN COMPANIES TO SEEK MEANINGFUL CONTRIBUTIONS FOR THE CREATION OF A NUISANCE. SO THAT IS PERMITTED IN I THINK THE LANGUAGE THAT IS RELIED ON BY THE OPPOSITION -- IS IS BEING READ IN A VERY NARROW WAY NOT IN THE CONTEXT -- WITHIN THIS DECISION ALSO MENTIONED BECAUSE I HAD NOT HEARD THIS ARGUMENT BEFORE BUT THE IDEA THAT SOMEHOW THIS WOULD IMPACT TENANTS IN A NEGATIVE WAY. WE HAVE SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL FROM THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE TENANTS COMMUNITY. AND WE ARE CONCERNED HERE THE REASON WE NEED TO MOVE FOR WITH THIS BILL. IS IF THE LEAD PAINT COMPANIES ARE ALLOWED TO SUE EVEN ONE HOMEOWNER. THAT WILL CREATE AN ENORMOUS CHALLENGE AFFECT THAT DETERS OTHER HOME OWNERS AND THEIR TENANTS FROM BEING ABLE TO BENEFIT FROM LEAD PAINT Là PAINT ABATEMENT PROGRAMS WHICH WILL FURTHER LEAD TO THE POISONING OF NEW GENERATIONS OF KIDS AND FAMILIES SO THAT IS WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT. THE REAL QUICK IS IT JUST A IS IT A SHE'LL JUST FROM CONTRIBUTION IS THAT REALLY WHAT THE SHIELD JUST FROM CONTRIBUTION ACTIONS. IS THAT RIGHT. YES IT IS IT'S FOR CONTRIBUTION AND ONE OF THE REASONS THAT THIS IS SO NARROW IS THAT AND TYPICALLY THERE REALLY. THESE THREATS OF CONTRIBUTION LAWSUITS DON'T HAVE ANY MERIT THE COURT OF APPEALS IN OUR LAWSUIT DID NOT SAY THAT THEY HAVE A RIGHT OR DUE PROCESS RIGHT. TO BRING. ADDITIONAL CASES IT WAS DICK DATA AS INDICATED ON PAGE SEVEN OF LEGISLATIVE ANALYSIS AND IN ORDER TO BE IT CODE PORT FEES ARE OR TO BE LIABLE FOR CONTRIBUTION YOU HAVE TO HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE PUBLIC NUISANCE. HERE THE PUBLIC NUISANCE WAS THE MANUFACTURE DISTRIBUTION AND PROMOTION VIA ADVERTISEMENTS OF LEAD PAINT NO INDIVIDUAL HOMEOWNER PARTICIPATED IN. BUT ANY RATIONAL HOMEOWNER WHO'S AFRAID OF BEING SUED BY LEAD PAINT COMPANY WOULD PROBABLY. TAKE A STEP BACK AND HAVE A SECOND THOUGHT ABOUT PARTICIPATING IN THIS PROGRAM IF THAT'S WHAT THEY THOUGHT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN AND WE CAN'T LET THAT HAPPEN THIS IS BASICALLY. THE LEAD PAINT COMPANY IS TRYING TO GET OUT OF THE JUDGMENT AFTER THEY'VE ALREADY LOST APPEALS AT THE CALIFORNIA COURT OF APPEAL AND THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT. BY TRYING TO GET THEIR MONEY BACK ON THE BACK AND BY SCARING PEOPLE FROM TAKING IT. WILL BUT THE COURT DID SAY. YOU KNOW IN THE END THE DECISION FOR THE MORE NOTHING PRECLUDES A DEFENDANT FROM TESTING THE LEAD PAINT AT SPECIFIC LOCATIONS DURING THE REMEDIATION PROCESS AND SEEKING TO HOLD A FELLOW DEFENDANT LIABLE FOR A GREATER SHARE THE RESPONSIBILITY. RIGHT WAS IN THE COURT SORT OF OPENING THAT UP THAT. THAT THAT COULD BE THE CASE ALL OF FELLOW DEFENDANT WOULD BE ANOTHER LEAD PAINT COMPANY IT WOULD NOT BE A HOMEOWNER. AND THEN THE THESE CONTRIBUTIONS COULD BE BROUGHT AGAINST HOMEOWNERS INDIVIDUAL HOMEOWNERS AS WELL AS YOU KNOW WE SEEM TO BE FOCUSED ON APARTMENTS RIGHT AND YOU KNOW LARGE TENET COMPLEXES BUT THIS. THIS WOULD ALSO BE A SHIELD FOR INDIVIDUAL HOMEOWNERS WHO APPLIED TO LEAD PAINT CRACKED WITHOUT A. B. TWO OH SIX TO PROTECT ALL HOMEOWNERS THE LEAD PAINT COMPANIES COULD SUE ANY HOMEOWNER INCLUDING. AN INDIVIDUAL IN THEIR SINGLE FAMILY RESIDENCE. AND THEN JUST TO MISTER MOFFETT I'D I WOULD BE HAPPY MAYBE RESPOND A COUPLE OF THESE THINGS -- BUT SPECIFICALLY YOU SAID THAT THEY COULD USE THIS TO COVER UP EVIDENCE. AND I'M JUST CURIOUS AS TO HOW. HOW WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT LIKE WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT WHEN YOU'RE SAYING? NO THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION I DID NOT SAY COVER UP EVIDENCE. ONE OF THE VERY PLEASED PLEASE CLICK ON THE THE YOU KNOW IT AND AND AND ADDRESSING THE THE EARLIER ISSUE I MEAN. THE THE THE QUOTE YOU READ FROM THE APPELLATE COURT IS CORRECT BUT YOU LEFT OFF THE LAST SENTENCE WHICH IS. YOU KNOW THE THE COURT TALKED ABOUT THEY'RE LIABLE PAINT COMPANIES THAT WE MAY BE ABLE TO SEE CONTRIBUTION FROM. BUT THEN THE COURT WENT ON TO SAVE IN THIS SENSE DIRECTLY AFTER THAT THE SAME IS TRUE OF EVIDENCE THAT THE HAZARDOUS CONDITION. IS THE OWNER'S FAULT OR THAT IT IS NOT HAZARDOUS I DO SEE THAT IT SAYS THAT AND SO YOU KNOW THAT IS THAT'S I THINK THE KEY POINT OF OF THAT DECISION AGAIN IT ALL COMES BACK. TO DID THE HOMEOWNER FOLLOW EXISTING LAW THIS IS SEPARATE AND ASIDE FROM THIS CASE EXISTING LAW. PUTS LEGAL OBLIGATIONS ON A LANDLORD ON A HOMEOWNER TO MAINTAIN LEAD BASED PAINT IF IT'S INTACT THEY HAVE NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT IF THEY HAVE MAINTAIN THEIR HOME THEY HAVE NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT. IF THEY HAVE NOT IF IT IS DETERIORATED THERE MIGHT BE SOME SOME CONTRIBUTORY NEGLIGENCE SINCE SOME COMPARATIVE FAULT. SOME CONTRIBUTIONS THAT IS DUE TO THE FUND BECAUSE THEY FAILED TO FOLLOW. WHAT HAS BEEN THE LAW FOR THE LAST TWENTY YEARS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA? ALL OF THESE FOLKS CAN CLEAN THIS STUFF UP TODAY AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT HAS THE AUTHORITY AND POWER IN LAW TO FORCE. HOMEOWNERS WITH DETERIORATED DETERIORATED LEAD PAINT TO FORCE THEM TO CLEAN IT UP. TODAY. AND IF THEY WOULD DO THAT TODAY. THEY DON'T EVER NEED TO WORRY ABOUT THIS WITH RESPECT TO THE EVIDENCE QUESTION -- YOU KNOW SECTION B. E. OF THE BILL DEALS WITH PARTICIPATION IN THE REMEDIATION PROGRAM AND WHETHER THAT CAN BE USED AS EVIDENCE. FOR IMMUNITY FROM EXISTING OR OTHER PORTIONS OF EXISTING CALIFORNIA LAW. AGAIN YOU KNOW IS THAT OUR LAWSUIT I DON'T KNOW I DON'T THINK SO THAT'S POTENTIALLY ATTENDANCE LAWSUIT. AND AT TEN IT MIGHT LOOK AT THAT AND SAY WELL LOOK YOU KNOW I DIDN'T KNOW ALL THE I WAS BEING BECAUSE THIS HARM. BECAUSE THE HOME WAS IN A LEAD PAINT WAS IN A DETERIORATED CONDITION BECAUSE THE LANDLORD. FAILED TO MAINTAIN IT BUT THE ONLY EVIDENCE I HAVE BECAUSE I'M LIVING IN MY HOME I'M NOT WROTE RUNNING AROUND COLLECTING EVIDENCE FOR FUTURE THAT THIS EXISTED. ARE THE INSPECTION RECORDS AND EVERYTHING THAT WENT ALONG WITH PARTICIPATION THE REMEDIATION PROGRAM. AND SO IN SOME WAYS I DON'T BELIEVE IT'S A COVER UP OF EVIDENCE BUT THE BILL IS A BAR. OF WHAT COULD BE A KEY PIECE OF EVIDENCE FOR A TENANT IN BRINGING A FUTURE LAWSUIT AGAINST A A RECALCITRANT LAND LAND LANDLORDS WHO ISN'T FOLLOWING EXISTING CALIFORNIA LAW ASIDE FROM THE CASE MAYBE JUST TO CLEAR SO WHAT ARE YOU SEE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS THAT DURING IF SOMEONE. PARTICIPATES IN THE REMEDIATION PROCESS. AND AS MAYBE THERE'S PICTURES OR SOMETHING AS A RESULT OF THAT REMEDIATION PROCESS THAT SHOWS THAT WAS IN A DETERIORATED CONDITION -- THAT UNDER THIS BILL -- BECAUSE THAT WAS PART OF THE REMEDIATION PROCESS IT CAN'T BE USED AS EVIDENCE BY. OTHERS BRING IN AN ACTION THE REMEDIATION PROGRAM OUTLINED BY THE COURT. REQUIRES AN INSPECTION. BY LOCAL GOVERNMENT OR OTHER OFFICIAL CHARGED YOU KNOW THAT THEY DID THE JURISDICTIONS DECIDE SHOULD. CONDUCT THOSE INSPECTIONS AND THEN GO THROUGH AND DO THE REMEDIATION. AND SO WHATEVER EVIDENCE IS GATHERED AS PART OF THAT INSPECTION. THAT IS USED TO DETERMINE WHAT LEVEL OF REMEDIATION IS DED IN THAT HOME. OUR READ OF THE BILL IS THAT NONE OF THAT USED. AS EVIDENCE THAT THE HOME WAS A NUISANCE WAS THAT STANDARD VIOLATED EXISTING HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE IS UNTENABLE. AND AND A HOME BEING UNTENABLE BRINGS ALONG WITH THAT RIGHTS. FOR TENANTS [inaudible] LAUREN. THANK YOU YOU HAVE A MOTION AS THEIR SECONDS. I HAD TO SECONDS BY MR CHILD. THANK YOU. I JUST FIND THIS DISCUSSION KIND OF ASTONISHING AFTER LAST YEAR WHEN AGAIN IT WAS THE PAIN COMPANIES TRY TO FOIST OFF ON THE VOTERS. THEIR LIABILITY AND THEY CREATED THIS VAST PROPAGANDA MACHINE LAST YEAR AS WELL TRYING TO SCARE HOMEOWNERS INTO THINKING THAT THE COURT. HAD HELD THAT THE HOMES THEMSELVES WERE THE NUISANCE WHEN IT WAS IN FACT. THE SALE OF THE LEAD PAINT THAT WAS THE NEW SINCE I THINK THE COURT WAS VERY CLEAR ABOUT THAT AND AGAIN. THE ARGUMENTS DEPEND ON OF THE ARGUMENTS OPPOSITION REALLY DEPEND ON THAT OBFUSCATION AND THAT SAME. DESIRE TO PASS THE BUCK. BECAUSE THERE'S THE COURT DECIDED TO PUT A LIMITED TIME FRAME. THAT'S WHAT'S AT RISK HERE IF WE HAD MUCH LONGER TO DEAL WITH I THINK WE WE COULD START TO PARTS OF THESE ARGUMENTS MORE FINELY BUT I DON'T THINK THAT'S WORTH IT. AT THE END IN ANY CASE BUT NOW THE SPECIALLY BECAUSE OF THE SHORT TIME I'M TO GET THE MONEY SPENT ANYTHING THAT WILL DELAY THAT MONEY. BEING SPENT AND GET ACTUAL REMEDIATION ARE COMMUNITIES. IS HARM TO OUR COMMUNITIES AND THAT'S WHY I THINK WE SHOULD BE STANDING UP FOR THAT'S THE PURPOSE OF THE OF THIS BILL. HE WAS A TWO YOU MAY CLOSE RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU SO THE MOTION IS DO PASS CALL THE ROLL PLEASE STONE BY STONE AYE GALLAGHER. GALLAGHER I CHAO. CHAO I'D SHOOT BY CHIU AYE GONZALEZ. CONSOLES I HOLDEN KALRA KILEY. MAIENSCHEIN.

IS IT IS IT IS OUT THAT IS AB FOR SIXTY FIVE BY EGGMAN THE BILL IS ON ITS WAY TO HUMAN SERVICES. THIS GONZALEZ AB. FIFTY ONE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS -- ONCE AGAIN I BRING BACK A BILL -- THAT WAS PASSED OF THIS LEGISLATURE ROUND TWO LIKE MANY PEOPLE ARE AT THIS POINT. OUR LEGISLATURE PASSES SOME OF THE STRONGEST WORKER PROTECTIONS IN THE COUNTRY BUT THOSE LAWS ARE WORTHLESS IF THEY CAN'T BE ENFORCING COURT OR BY THE STATE AGENCIES BECAUSE EMPLOYER HAS FORCED THEIR WORKERS TO SIGN AWAY THEIR RIGHTS IN AN ARBITRATION AGREEMENT. THIS INCLUDES VIOLATION SUCH AS PAY INEQUITY SEXUAL HARASSMENT DISCRIMINATION RETALIATION AND AGREE JUST LABOR VIOLATIONS LIKE WAGE THEFT. MANDATING THAT EMPLOYEES GO TO ARBITRATION IS A PRACTICE THAT ALLOWS COMPANIES TO FORCE EMPLOYEE COMPLAINTS INTO SECRETIVE HEARINGS WHICH HIGH LABOR VIOLATIONS FROM PUBLIC SILENCE VICTIMS WITH NON DISCLOSURE AGREEMENTS AND OFTEN PROTECT SERIAL OFFENDERS. ARBITRATION CAN BE A HIGHLY EFFECTIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION METHOD WHEN BOTH PARTIES CHOOSE IT FREELY IS FAR LESS SUCCESSFUL WHEN THE MORE POWERFUL PARTY FORCES THE OTHER TAKES UP TO THE TERMS. THAT IS WHY AB FIFTY ONE DOES NOT PROHIBIT EMPLOYERS FROM USING ARBITRATION AGREEMENTS TO RESOLVE WORKPLACE DISPUTES INSTEAD IT SIMPLY REQUIRES THAT EMPLOYEES CHOOSE TO SIGN SUCH AGREEMENTS WITHOUT THE THREAT OF JOB LOSS OR OTHER RETALIATORY ACTIONS. AB FIFTY ONE DOES NOT SEEK TO RENDER SUCH AGREEMENTS UNENFORCEABLE IT SIMPLY PROVIDES FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF WHEN EMPLOYERS ARE FORCING WORKERS TO WAIVE RIGHTS IN ORDER TO PURSUE OR KEEP A JOB AND EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS. ALL CONTRACTS MUST BE VOLUNTARY AND NOT THE RESULTS OF COURSE IN TWO NINE A WORKER A LIVELIHOOD IF THEY DO NOT SIGN A WAIVER OF THE RIGHT IS ANYTHING BUT VOLUNTARY. THIS BILL TAKES THE NECESSARY STEPS TOWARDS PROTECTING AND EMPOWERING VICTIMS IN THE WORKPLACE FROM PORTION HARASSMENT AND DISCRIMINATION WE MADE AMENDMENTS TO ADDRESS OPPOSITIONS CONCERN AROUND THE PROVISION OF THE BILL THAT PROHIBITS THE WAIVER OF EMPLOYEES RIGHTS. AS A CONDITION OF CONTRACTUAL AGREEMENT THEY BELIEVE IT WOULD PROHIBIT POST DISPUTE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS AND NEGOTIATE SEVERANCE AGREEMENTS THIS WAS NEVER THE INTENTION OF OUR BILL AND WE MADE AMENDMENTS ACCORDINGLY TO CLARIFY WE'VE ALSO MADE ADDITIONAL MEMBERS TO CLARIFY THAT AB FIFTY ONE IS IN NO WAY INTENDED TO INVALIDATE OR INTERFERE WITH EXISTING ARBITRATION AGREEMENTS OTHER TECHNICAL MEHMET'S PER. REMOTE PROVISIONS THAT WERE PASSED IN CENTER JACKSON'S SB THIRTEEN HUNDRED LAST YEAR. I TO NOT WITNESSES WITH ME TODAY TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT. MICHAEL YOUNGER THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION AND JACQUI CERTAIN OF THE CONSUMER ATTORNEYS. THANK YOU FIRST WITNESS PLEASE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MIKE WE OWE THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION WHEN THE CO SPONSORED THE BILL WHEN I THINK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS LEGISLATION BECAUSE OF FORCED ARBITRATION IS AN AREA THAT AFFECTS SO MANY WORKERS ACROSS -- SO MANY DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES -- IT BACK ARBITRATION WAS ONLY IN ABOUT 16% OF WORKPLACES -- BUT TODAY WE KNOW THE FORCE ARBITRATION COVERS ABOUT 68% OF CALIFORNIA WORKERS -- MAY AND WE KNOW THE REASON WHY IS BECAUSE THEY EMPLOYERS DO BETTER IN THIS FORUM WE KNOW THAT FEWER WORKERS TAKE CLAIMS ARBITRATION WE KNOW THAT THE FEW WORKERS WHO DO TAKE THOSE CLAIMS. TO ARBITRATION ARE LESS LIKELY TO WIN WE KNOW THAT THE FEW WORKERS WHO DO WIN WIN SUBSTANTIALLY LAST LESS IN DAMAGES -- SO THE SYSTEMS CLEARLY BROKEN AND WILD -- STATES ARE LIMITED IN WHAT THEY CAN DO IN THIS SPACE WE BELIEVE THAT WE'VE CRAFTED A NEARLY TAYLOR BILL THAT AVOIDS ANY FEDERAL PREEMPTION ISSUES -- WE BELIEVE THIS IS A SPACE WHERE CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO LEAD WE UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE COMPANIES THAT ARE ALREADY SORT OF WALKING BACK FROM THIS SORT OF FORCED ARBITRATION POLICY AMBLIN THINGS DIFFERENT PROPOSALS -- AND AND WE BELIEVE THAT IT IF YOU CONTINUE WITH SYSTEM WHERE EMPLOYERS CAN PAY A PRIVATE PARTY TO INTERPRET THE LAW IN A WAY THAT THE BENEFITS THEM. AND THEM FORCE WORKERS TO BE STUCK WITH THAT RULING -- PROHIBIT THEM FROM GOING FROM GETTING AN APPEAL EVEN IF THE RULING IS WRONG AND INTO THE WORKER THEY CAN'T TALK TO ANYBODY ABOUT IT THAT THEY SYSTEMS COULD BE BROKE IT MAKES A LOS WE PASS YOUR MEANINGLESS IT MAKES ALL THE WORK PROTECTIONS OF RIGHTS PROTECTIONS. THE PASS IF YOU HEARD THAT WE PASSING LABOR COLD MEANINGLESS IF THOSE RIGHTS CAN BE A FORCE SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE ARE TONIGHT. THANK YOU EXPERTS. GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MY NAME IS JACKIE CERNAN I'M HERE ON THE BEHALF THAT CONSUMER TRAINEES OF CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT OF AB. FIFTY ONE TODAY CLOSE 270% OF CALIFORNIA'S WORKFORCE IS BOUND BY THESE AGREEMENTS. NATIONWIDE IT'S MORE THAN SIXTY MILLION WORKERS. ARBITRATIONS CAN BE FAIR LIKE MENTIONED BEFORE WHEN IT'S BETWEEN PEOPLE WITH EQUAL -- BARGAINING POWER BUT THE REALITY IS THAT IF A WAS SINGLE WORKERS FORCED AGAINST THEIR EMPLOYER INTO ARBITRATION THE REAL RESULT IS CLAIM SUPPRESSION IN MANY INSTANCES. ESPECIALLY AMONG LOW WAGE WORK OF LOW WAGE WORKERS. AND WE ALL KNOW THAT ONE THIRD OF OUR NATION -- IN THE SERVICE INDUSTRY AND RESTAURANT INDUSTRY AND SO FOR THEM MOST OF THEM WILL NEVER BRING THEIR CLAIMS -- IT'S ALSO UNFAIR AND ONE SIDED WHILE THE ARBITRATION CLAUSES TAKE AWAY THE CONSUMER AND EMPLOYERS RIGHT TO HAVE THEIR CLAIMS HEARD BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY -- THAT'S NOT THE SAME FOR THE CORPORATION THE CORPORATION IS STILL OUT TO SUE IN COURT. I'M IT ALSO PROHIBITS CONSUMERS AND EMPLOYEES FIRST PURSUING A COMPANY EVEN IF THEY CAUGHT EVEN IF THE COMPANY BROKE FEDERAL OR STATE LAWS. THAT REGULATE DISCRIMINATION BASED ON GENDER RACE OR DISABILITY. THE RESULT OF DOING NOTHING IS THAT THIS PUBLIC SYSTEM OF PUBLIC JUSTICE IS RESULTING IN CLAIMS NEVER COMING FORWARD. SOME COMPANIES ARE FINALLY STARTING TO DO THE RIGHT THING AFTER BEING -- FORCED BY SOME OTHER WORKERS WE SELL GOOGLE JUST A FEW MONTHS AGO ANNOUNCED THAT THEY WERE NO LONGER GOING TO BE REQUIRING THEIR WORK FORCE. TO SIGN THESE TYPES OF AGREEMENTS BUT THE REALITY IS THAT MUCH WORK NEEDS TO BE DONE IN AB FIFTY ONE IS ONE OF THE FIRST STEPS THAT WE NEED TO TAKE IN CALIFORNIA -- WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT WORKERS HAVE A CHOICE BEFORE HAVING TO SIGN THESE CAUSES. AND WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. THIS IS AS YOU MENTIONED THE AMENDMENTS WE ARE TAKING THE AMENDMENTS THAT ARE IN THE ANALYSIS. ABSOLUTELY I WANT TO THANK YOUR STAFF FOR PROVIDING I'D TALK THEM THROUGH I'M SORRY IF I IT WASN'T CLEAR THAT WE ARE ABSOLUTE ACCEPTING YOUR COMMITTEE THANK YOU VERY THOSE RESUME BUT I DON'T WANT TO BE CLEAR ON THE RECORD SO THANK YOU.

MORNING THIS GERMAN MEMBERS OVER A TRICK ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA APTLY TERRY SO SHE SHOULD. AND UNITED FOR COMMERCIAL WORKERS STATES COUNCIL IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. RIGHT SIGNAL IN OPPOSITION. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS -- JENNIFER BROWN WE HAVE THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND WE ARE OPPOSED TO AB FIFTY WHEN I DO WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR TAKING THE AMENDMENTS TO CLEAR UP THE ISSUE WITH REGARD TO SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS -- WE DEFINITELY ARE ARE PLEASED WITH THAT AMENDMENT ARE ARE GRATEFUL THAT THAT IS -- CLARIFIED [inaudible] HOWEVER I THE ISSUE OF ARBITRATION THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT THEY FEEL IS A DEBATE THAT WE HAVE ON AN ANNUAL BASIS HERE IN THIS COMMITTEE AND NOT MUCH HAS CHANGED FROM LAST YEAR WHEN WE HAD THIS DISCUSSION EXCEPT FOR THE FACT THAT THERE'S BEEN MORE CASES ISSUED BY THE UNITED. STATES SUPREME COURT EMPHASIZING THE STRENGTH AND BRIGHTNESS OF THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT IN ITS PREEMPTION -- THE REFERENCE IN THE ANALYSIS BY THE SUPPORTERS THAT THE ISSUE WITH REGARDS THE FORMATION OF CONTRACT BEAN AND UNSETTLED OR NOT -- CLEAR ISSUE WITH REGARDS THE APPLE I FEEL WAS CLEARED UP IN THE KINDRED NURSING CASE BY JUSTICE KAGAN WHEN SHE SAID. THAT THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT NOT ONLY APPLIES TO THE INTERPRETATION OF A CONTRACT ONCE FORMED BUT ALSO APPLIES TO FORMATION OF CONTRACT AND IF YOU PUT A SET A SPECIAL RESTRICTION. ON THE FORMATION OF AN ARBITRATION A CONTRACT THAT IS NOT APPLICABLE TO ALL CONTRACTS THEN IT VIOLATES THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT AND IT IS PREEMPTED. IT'S THE SAME REASON WHY IN -- THE SECURELY CASE WHITE MEMORIAL VERSUS THE HILLY AB TWO SIX ONE SEVEN BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER WEBER WAS STRUCK DOWN AS PRINTED IN THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT AS WELL BECAUSE IT ALSO PUT A SPONSOR A SPECIAL RESTRICTION. ON THE FORMATION OF AN ARBITRATION AGREEMENT IN A CONSUMER CONTRACT JUST LIKE AB FIFTY ONE IT SAID. THAT YOU CANNOT HAVE AN ARBITRATION AGREEMENT THAT'S REQUIRED AS A CONDITION OF SIGNING A CONSUMER CONTRACT THE COURT THE CALIFORNIA COURT OF APPEALS SAID THAT'S PRINTED IN THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT BECAUSE IT PUTS A SPECIAL RESTRICTION. ON THE FORMATION OF AN ARBITRATION AGREEMENT THAT IS NOT APPLICABLE TO ALL THE CONTRACTS SEEM ISSUE APPLIES HERE WITH REGARDS TO A. B. FIFTY ONE IT BASICALLY SAYS YOU CANNOT HAVE AN ARBITRATION AGREEMENT. THAT'S MADE AS A CONDITION OF EMPLOYMENT CONTRACT SO WE FEEL LIKE IT'S LIKELY TO BE PRINTED AND THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT AND WE BELIEVE IT'S THE SAME REASON WHY GOVERNR BROWN SAID LAST YEAR. THAT THIS BILL PLAINLY VIOLATES FEDERAL LAW I DID IT REFERENCE THE AMENDMENT IN THE ANALYSIS TO SAY THAT NOTHING BASICALLY IS MEANT -- TO RENDER AN AGREEMENT OTHERWISE UNENFORCEABLE UNDER THE FAA IT BUT I DON'T BELIEVE THAT SAVES IT FROM THE PREEMPTION OF THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT YES ONCE AN AGREEMENT AS FOR FORMED. THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT WILL APPLY BUT IT ALSO A CONTRACTS IS NOT NEW ARENA IN THE ARMY THERE IS CASE WITH REGARDS TO THIS -- CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT IT WAS IN AN HUSING CONTRACT IN THE COURT DIDN'T STRIKE DOWN THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT ON THAT BASIS IT JUST SAID IF YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE ANY HUSING CONTRACT. YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE SUBSTANTIVE RIGHTS INCLUDED IN THAT PROCEDURAL SO IT'S CONSTABLE -- I ALSO HAVE BEEN HAVING THIS DEBATE LONG ENOUGH TO REALIZE THAT MY AB PERSPECTIVE ON THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT MAY NOT BE THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE COMMITTEE -- AND THAT THIS BILL MAY MAKE IT THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE LIKE IT DID LAST YEAR AND MAYBE IT IS ULTIMATELY SIGNED BY GOVERNOR NEWSOME WE'RE NOT SURE NECESSARILY OBVIOUSLY ABOUT THAT WILL GO. BUT IF IT IS I'M ALSO QUITE CONFIDENT THAT JUST LIKE AB TWENTY SIX SEVENTEEN IT WILL BE IMMEDIATELY CHALLENGED AND BECAUSE OF HOW BROAD THIS BILL IS WITH RESPECT TO IT SPLIT APPLICATION. TO ALL LABOR CO CLAIMS AND ALL CLAIMS UNDER THE FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING ACT IT'S VERY LIKELY THAT IT WILL BE IMMEDIATELY CHALLENGED ON THE BASIS OF FEDERAL PREEMPTION. IF THAT'S THE CASE -- I FULLY BELIEVE THAT THE INTENT OF THE AUTHOR IS TO PROTECT EMPLOYEES BUT I DON'T SEE HOW THAT PROVIDES ANY ADDITIONAL PROTECTION TO EMPLOYEES IT'S GOING TO ADD ANOTHER LAYER OF LITIGATION IT'S GOING. TO COST AND IT'S GOING TO ADD DELAY TO THE ULTIMATE RESOLUTION OF THE UNDERLYING DISPUTE THAT DOESN'T BENEFIT EMPLOYEES WITH REGARDS TEMP UNCERTAINTY CERTAINLY DOESN'T -- BENEFIT EMPLOYERS -- THE THE CHALLENGE ON AB TWENTY SIX SEVENTEEN TOOK APPROXIMATELY TWO TO THREE YEARS THE CHALLENGE -- THAT I JUST REFERENCE WITH THE CAN -- NURSING CASE WITH REGARDS TO INFORMATION CONTRACT THE SUPREME COURT TYPE OF LITIGATION -- TO LAYERED ON TOP OF AN IS SOMETHING AND IF IT'S EITHER THE EMPLOYER AT OR THE EMPLOYEE AND FOR THOSE REASONS WE ARE. THANK YOU EXCEPT THIS WITH GOOD MORNING CAN STONE OF STONE ADVOCACY ON BEHALF OF THE CIVIL JUSTICE ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA AND RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION -- WE ALSO APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEE IN THE AUTHORS AMENDMENTS -- FOR REGARDING -- CLARIFYING THAT DOESN'T APPLY TO SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS -- BUT REALLY -- SEE JACK TAKES ISSUE WITH THE PREMISE THAT ARBITRATION IS LESS TRUST THAN GOING TO COURT -- ARBITRATION IS A FAIR OF FISH AND AND JUST METHOD OF RESOLVING DISPUTES WHEN PEOPLE ARE WRONG -- TO THEY DON'T NECESSARILY WANT TO SUE THEY WANT TO SOLVE THEIR PROBLEM -- LABOR ORGANIZATIONS RECOGNIZE THAT -- ARBITRATION IS A FAIR AND EFFICIENT MEANS OF RESOLVING DISPUTE LAST YEAR THEY SPONSORED LEGISLATION TO PROVIDE RELIEF FROM PAGO LAWSUITS TO EMPLOYERS OF REPRESENTED UNION. MEMBERS WHO HAD ARBITRATION AGREEMENTS AS PART OF THEIR COLLECTIVE. BARGAINING AGREEMENTS CHOOSING TO IS A VALID CHOICE A RATIONAL CHOICE A SENSIBLE CHOICE COMPANIES CHOOSE TO USE THESE BECAUSE IT PROTECTS THEM FROM. A RUNAWAY VERDICT THAT WOULD ACOSTA TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY AND BY -- USING THEM WITH ALL OF THEIR EMPLOYEES THAT ALLOWS THEM TO PROVIDE GREATER -- WAGES AND BENEFITS TO THOSE EMPLOYEES. PARTICULARLY LOWER INCOME WORKERS ARE UNLIKELY TO FIND A LAWYER WHO WILL BRING. A LAWSUIT AGAINST A AN EMPLOYER BECAUSE THE AMOUNT OF DAMAGES ARE NOT GOING TO BE SUFFICIENTLY HIGH. TO MAKE IT WORTH IT TO TAKE A THIRD OF THAT AWARD. AND ARBITRATION AGREEMENTS WHICH ARE BY THE ARBITRATION PROCESS IS PAID FOR BY THE EMPLOYER. PROPONENTS TRIED TO MAKE IT SOUND LIKE THAT WAS SOMETHING NEFARIOUS THAT'S ACTUALLY A WORKER BENEFIT THEY DON'T HAVE TO PAY. OUT TO GO THROUGH ARBITRATION -- THAT PROCESS IS PAID -- FOR BY THE EMPLOYER. THAT STUDIES THAT HAVE BEEN DONE I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT TO YOU SOMETHING FROM THAT THE COALITION LETTER. EMPLOYEES ARE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE THEIR DAY IN COURT AN ARBITRATION THEN IN LITIGATION AND ARE MORE LIKELY TO RECEIVE JUSTICE WHEN THE DAY IS OR OVER. EMPLOYMENT ARBITRATION NEEDS TO BE PRESERVED IMPROVE NOT ABANDONED -- AND THEN THERE WAS ANOTHER. A STUDY FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN. THAT SAID THE VAST MAJORITY OF WERE IN MIDDLE INCOME EMPLOYEES ESSENTIALLY THOSE MAKING LESS THAN SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. CANNOT GET ACCESS TO THE COURTS TO VINDICATE THEIR CONTRACTUAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS MOST LAWYERS WILL NOT FIND THEIR CASES WERE SPARE TIME AND EXPENSE THEY'RE ONLY PRACTICAL HOPE IS THE GENERALLY CHEAPER FASTER. AND MORE INFORMAL PROCESS OF ARBITRATION. IF THAT IS SO CALLED MANDATORY ARBITRATION SO BE IT THERE IS NO VIABLE ALTERNATIVE SO WE JUST TAKE -- ISSUE WITH THE IDEA THAT THIS IS SOMEHOW SUB STANDARD JUSTICE IT IS NOT IT IS ANOTHER FOR I'M. VALID LEGITIMATE -- RECOGNIZED BY THE SUPREME COURT AND CALIFORNIA COURTS AS AS LEGITIMATE. WE ARE JUNE ABOUT. THANK YOU OTHERS IN OPPOSITION GIVE US YOUR NAME AND YOUR AFFILIATION PLEASE. MR TURN MEMBERS MIKE BELOW CALIFORNIA EMPLOYMENT LAW COUNCIL OPPOSE THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS CHRISTMAS KAYLEE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA AMBULANCE ASSOCIATION IN THE CALIFORNIA FORESTRY ASSOCIATION IN OPPOSITION. GOOD MORNING MR TURN MEMBERS MATTHEW WELL WITH WESTERN GROWERS ARE ALSO OPPOSED. GOOD MORNING BRIAN LITTLE CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU FEDERATION FOR THE REASONS PREVIOUSLY STATED OPPOSED THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. RIGHT SEE NONE OF BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE MISTER KALRA THANK YOU -- DOES. IF THERE WERE NOT ABLE FAN OF IT IF WE'RE NOT REQUIRED TO SIGN IN OUR GROUP TO ARBITRATION AGREEMENT -- BUT I WHICH I SHOULD BE OFF THE TABLE. IT WAS JUST. SO I WANT TO BE REALLY CLEAR. YOU KNOW WE OBVIOUSLY IN THIS BILL HAVE HAVE POINTED OUT SOME OF THE SHORTCOMINGS OF ARBITRATION I COME FROM THE LABOR MOVEMENT WE WE BELIEVE IN BINDING ARBITRATION WHEN PARTY'S VOLUNTARILY ENTER INTO IT AND THERE IS SOME EQUITY IN POWER -- THAT'S MISSING HERE AND SO IN WE THINK EVEN WITH THE NATIONAL ARBITRATION ACT WHAT'S MISSING IS THE COERCION PIECE. CONSENT TO GO INTERPRETATION SHOULD ALWAYS BE ON THE TABLE IN EVEN AND DISPUTES IT SHOULD BE SOMETHING THAT A WORKER CAN ENTER INTO IF THEY DON'T WANT TO SO IF THEY HAVE AN EMPLOYER WHO ACTUALLY WILL. ARBITRATE SOMETHING A TIMELY MATTER WERE SEEN THAT THAT'S NOT ALWAYS THE CASE -- YOU KNOW THAT THE ARBITRATORS ACTUALLY GOING TO BE PAID FOR THERE ARE A LOT OF CONDITIONS THAT I THINK -- ARE NECESSARY FOR THAT TO BE A A GOOD CHOICE FOR A WORKER THE TRUTH IS RIGHT NOW THAT THERE IS NO CHOICE. AND THAT'S WHAT WE WANT TO ADD WE WANT TO ADD SOME PRETTY CHOICE FOR THE EMPLOYER WHICH ALREADY EXIST AND WILL CONTINUE TO EXIST BUT THAT THERE'S A CHOICE AS WELL FOR THE WORKER AND THAT'S WHETHER OR NOT THERE THEIR COURSE TO SIGN IT AS A CONDITION OF EMPLOYMENT. AND I THINK THAT'S A GOOD MY POINT IS WELL TAKEN BECAUSE NOT ARBITRATION OR LITIGATION AS THE AS THE OPTIONS THE CHOICE AND I DO THINK THAT. IN ALSO -- BUT SOMEONE THAT BELIEVES THAT THE ARBITRATION ABSOLUTE PLAYS WELL AS A REASON WHY IT DOES EXIST. IT IN OUR SYSTEM IN AN OFTENTIMES RESOLVES ISSUES IN A MORE EFFICIENT CLASS C.. UP MORE OR A COST EFFECTIVE MANNER. BUT TO SAY IT SHOULD BE THE IT IS THE ONLY WAY OR SHOULD OR MUST BE THE ONLY WAY AS A CONDITION OF EMPLOYMENT I THINK THAT. CITING AN ARBITRATION AGREEMENT IT CERTAINLY COULD BE A VALID AND REASONABLE AND SENSIBLE CHOICE WAS GONNA BE A CHOICE I THINK THAT'S REALLY WHAT IT COMES DOWN TO IS THE CHOICE THAT. MAKES SENSE IN ORDER TO RESOLVE DISPUTES BUT MAKING SURE THAT WORKERS BUT I'M PUT IN A POSITION -- NUMBER DAY ONE OR FOR THE FOR THE FOUR DAY ONE OF EMPLOYMENT. THAT THEY'RE OUT THERE MAKING A CHOICE ON SOMETHING WHEN IT'S REALLY NOT A CHOICE BECAUSE THEY CAN SAY NO I WON'T SIGN IT AND THEN THEY DON'T HAVE A JOB. AND SO THAT'S A REALLY FALSE CHOICE I THINK HAVING THE OPPORTUNITY. TO RESOLVE ISSUES IN THE WAY THAT MAKE. RESOLVING A RESOLVING ISSUES RESOLVING CONFLICT IN A WAY THAT MAKES SENSE AND HAVING ALL OPTIONS ON THE TABLE. ACTUALLY -- THIS THIS BILL IS DOES THAT BECAUSE IT ALLOWS ALL OPTIONS ON THE TABLE NOT JUST ONE OPTION -- THAT THE EMPLOYER CHOOSES AND THEN SO I THINK IT'S IT'S REASONABLE AND AND THERE'S NO DOUBT LOOK ON ON ON BIG ISSUES LIKE THIS CERTAINLY. THE MAYBE LITIGATION AND AND ALL THAT THE COURTS DECIDE -- BUT I THINK IT'S AN ISSUE THAT -- THAT SHOULD BE DECIDED AT THAT THAT NEEDS TO HAVE SOME BY ANALOGY AT SOME POINT BECAUSE THERE'S GOING TO BE THIS BACK AND FORTH. BUT THAT THAT'S GOING TO CONTINUE TO A CAR UNTIL THERE'S SOME CERTAINTY AND I THINK THAT AT SOME POINT SOME ISSUES AS ARE SOME CERTAINTY AT THIS IS ONE OF THEM SOME OF THE BILL. THANK YOU WE DO HAVE A MOTION IS THERE SECONDS. AND A SECOND THANK YOU. OTHER MEMBERS TOGETHER -- YEAH WE'LL JUST. ONE OF THE THINGS HERE THAT I THINK IS AN ISSUE IS THAT ACTUALLY IT HAS BEEN DECIDED. THE COURTS HAVE DECIDED THESE CASES TIME AND TIME AGAIN THAT ONE IS PREEMPTED BY -- THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT AND THEN ALSO THAT THESE AREN'T. CONSIDERED CAUGHT CONTRACTS OF ADHESION -- SO THERE HAS BEEN RULINGS ON THIS WHERE COURTS HAVE CONSIDERED A LOT OF THE THINGS THAT. ARE BEING BROUGHT UP AND HAVE DECIDED DIFFERENTLY -- WHICH IS I SUPPOSE WHEN YOU KNOW THE WHY THIS BILLS PAIN BROUGHT RIGHT TO TRY AND CODIFY SOMETHING IN SORT OF FORCE. THE ISSUE THAT WAY -- BUT NONE THE LESS I THINK YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE CONTAINER RIGHT INTO. FEDERAL PREEMPTION ISSUES YOU KNOW WHICH YOU KNOW I THINK WAS POINTED OUT AS AS ONE OF THE YEAH LOOK WE'VE WE'VE ALREADY HAD LAWS OVERTURNED BECAUSE OF IT YOU KNOW WHY WOULD THIS. BE ANY DIFFERENT -- THE OTHER THING THE OTHER ASPECT ON IF THERE WAS A WAGE AN HOUR VIOLATION RAY -- OR IF THERE WAS A VIOLATION OF SAY OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HAZARD -- EMPLOYEES WOULD STILL HAVE THE BENEFIT OF GOING TO GOING TO THE STATE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESSES FOR PENALTIES AND FINES IS NOT CORRECT NO THAT'S NOT TRUE IN FACT THE LABOR COMMISSIONER WON'T TAKE AT THE CLAIMS IF THERE IS AN ARBITRATION AGREEMENT. SO THEY WOULD NOT IT IS SO UNDER THESE UNDER THESE -- ARBITRATION AGREEMENTS THEY WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO GO BEFORE LABOR COMMISSIONER'S SALE OR GO THROUGH THE THE YOU KNOW CAL OSHA -- ADMINISTRATIVE LAW PROCESS IS THAT YOUR AND I DON'T KNOW ABOUT COLD CALLOUS I KNOW THEY CAN'T GO TO THE LABOR -- COMMISSIONER AND AS I IN ALL OF MY BILLS I I I PROBABLY SOUND A LITTLE SCHIZOPHRENIC RIGHT BECAUSE I OF BILLS THAT SAY I DON'T LIKE FEE HOW WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO THE LABOR COMMISSIONER'S WHILE. MEN LIKE FIA I'D LIKE THE LAID I LIKE THE LABOR CODE WE ARE LIKE ARE ONES THAT YOU LIKE BETTER THAN BUT THE POINT WELL THE POINT IS IT DEPENDS ON THE SITUATION AND THAT IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE THE FACT THAT. YOU KNOW IF I'M BEING CHEATED OUT OF WAGE IN OUR ISSUES AND I GO REPORT TO THE LABOR COMMISSIONER THEY'RE GOING TO SEND ME BACK TO MY EMPLOYER AND I HAVE TO WAIT ON HIM OR HER. TO TO HIRE AN ARBITRATOR TO GO I DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO WHAT'S THE WHAT'S. WHAT WHAT'S THE THE PRODUCT THERE'S ALSO NO APPEALS PROCESS WITH AN ARBITRATION SO IF YOU GO THROUGH ARBITRATION VOLUNTARILY THAT'S ONE THING BUT EVEN IF THE ARBITRATOR GETS THE WALL WRONG BLATANTLY WRONG? THERE'S NO SENSE THERE'S NO WAY TO FIX THAT -- THERE'S NO. KNOWLEDGE THAT THIS COULD BE GOING IF IF YOU'RE CHEATING ME OUT OF WAGES AND WORKING CONDITIONS IF YOU'RE CHEATING ME OUT OF A SAFE WORKING ENVIRONMENT YOU'RE PROBABLY DOING A TO A LOT OF OTHER EMPLOYEES AS WELL. THERE'S NO WAY TO ADDRESS EIGHT A FIX IN A BROADER WAY THROUGH ARBITRATION SO THAT'S WHY I THINK -- YOU KNOW AND AN EMPLOYEE SHOULD SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO ENTER INTO IT WITHOUT COERCION AND I THINK THAT YOU KNOW LOOK I KNOW THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF BILLS WE WE ARE A LOT OF COURT CASES WE READ THEM ALL. THIS WE THINK IS NARROWLY TAILORED TO ADDRESS THE THINGS THT THE COURT HAS SAID AND AND YOU KNOW. I I I DON'T HAVE A MAGIC EIGHT BALL I CAN'T TELL YOU WHAT THE COURT IS GOING TO SAY BUT WE KNOW THAT WE TOOK ALL THESE CASES AND THINGS THAT HAD BEEN REJECTED. AND WROTE A BILL -- THAT THAT WE THOUGHT ALLOWED A NARROW PATH TO SAY HEY LET'S JUST MAKE SURE WORKERS UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY'RE WHAT THEY'RE SIGNING ON TO AND THEY'RE WILLING TO SIGN ON TO THAT. SO IT'S A VALID I THINK APPROACH BUT YEAH IT TAKES AWAY NOT JUST COURT BUT WHAT I FIND TO BE -- MY PREFERRED AT COMMISSIONER. RIGHT NOW I MEAN AND I THINK THAT GOES TO SOME OF THIS TOO IS I THINK A LOT OF EMPLOYERS FEEL LIKE WHEN THEY GO. YOU KNOW TO THE LABOR COMMISSIONER FOR EXAMPLE AND HAVE AN ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE WHO'S. WHO'S EMPLOYED BY AND PAID BY THE SAME VERY SAME AGENCY -- THAT THEY'RE NOT GETTING NAY IT NECESSARILY A FAIR FORM THIS THEIR ISER RIGHT. YOU KNOW AND ALL JUDGES ARE PAID I'M I'M SORRY MR GALLAGHER BUT LIKE WHO PAYS FOR ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGES IT'S THIS WAY. A LITTLE BIT OFF TOPIC I MEAN I'M NOT SAYING I'M SAYING LIKE SO PEOPLE HAVE THEIR OF JUDGES WERE. THEIR PREFERRED FORUMS I'M NOT SAYING ALL JUDGE I'M SAYING THE VERY SAME AGENCY THAT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ENFORCEMENT IS ALSO EMPLOYING THE JUDGE SO THERE IS. OFTEN CONCERNS ABOUT THE NEUTRALITY IN AN EIGHT AND SECOND WERE A LITTLE OFF. THE BILL -- MIGHT THINK WE'RE ON THE SAME TOPIC BUT SO WE CAN DEBATE THE PRODUCTIVITY OF THE LABOR COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE AND THESE AGREEMENTS. CLUED AN EMPLOYEE FROM GOING TO THE LABOR COMMISSIONER. SO THE OR OR CAL OSHA BECAUSE I'M NOT SURE THAT I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE SHOT THAT THAT THAT THE QUESTION IS. OF A WORKER WHO WAS NOT PAID WAGES ARE TREATED UNFAIRLY WOULD STILL HAVE THE PROBLEM RESOLVED IT WOULD JUST BE THROUGH ARBITRATION RATHER THAN BY BRINGING A LAWSUIT OR BRINGING A CLAIM TO THE BUT LABOR. COMMISSIONER AND IF SO FOR TEN THIRTY ONE OUT JENNIFER IF IF I'D JUST AT THE LABOR COMMISSIONER PIECES ACTUALLY ACCURATE THERE WAS A CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT CASE THE SONIC CALABASAS CASE SAYING THAT AN ARBITRATION AGREEMENT COULD PREVENT -- IT AS A GOING TO THE LABOR COMMISSIONER HEARING TO HAVE AN ADMINISTRATOR JUDICATA ADMINISTRATIVE ADJUDICATION THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THE EMPLOYER COMMUNITY WOULD BE FINE ST YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN THAT GREAT LET THEM GO TO THE LABOR COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE IS JUST IT'S AGAIN PREEMPTED RATE YOU CAN'T. HAVE THE SPECIAL RESTRICTION AND IDENTIFY CLAIMS THAT CAN GO TO ARBITRATION AND ONES THAT CAN'T BY STATE STATUTE BECAUSE THAT'S INTERFERING WITH ARBITRATION SO IT IS IT AN AMENDMENT THAT WE WOULD LOVE TO OFFER UP AND SAY HEY WE BECAUSE WE WE THINK THE LABOR COMMISSIONER I HEARING PROCESS. VERY EFFICIENT PROCESS -- AND IT IS ONE THAT GETS THE RESOLUTION RESOLVED QUICKLY HOWEVER WE WOULD BE DISINGENUOUS AND OFFERING UP SOMETHING LIKE THAT IN A MINUTE BECAUSE IT WOULD BE PRINTED UNDER FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT AS DECIDED BY THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT IN THE SAUNA CALABASAS CASE. OCEANS DIFFERENT BECAUSE OSHA IS AN AGENCY ENFORCEMENT AND THERE'S NO REAL -- ABILITY FOR A PRIVATE EMPLOYER TO BUYING ARE BOUND. DID I SAY THAT RIGHT PROPER ENGLISH BIND -- I CAN'T DO THAT THE COURTS HAVE ALREADY HELD THAT THAT IS NOT -- ALLOWED SO YOU CAN'T HAVE A MANDATORY ARBITRATION FOR OSHA AGREEMENTS BUT THERE IS FOR LABOR COMMISSION AGREEMENTS. AND THEN I MEAN DO YOU BELIEVE THAT ARBITRATORS AREN'T NEUTRAL. ARE YOU ASKING ME THEM. AN ARBITRATOR IS PAID FOR BY THE EMPLOYER -- I I THINK THAT TIPS IN FAVOR OF ONE OVER THE OTHER I'M AND I THINK ARBITRATORS LIKE JUDGES CAN GET THINGS WRONG AND THAT THAT'S WHY WE HAVE AN APPEAL PROCESS BUT THERE'S NO APPEAL PROCESS THERE IS A NOTATION BUT THAT ACTUALLY IS IT CORRECT RIGHT BECAUSE YOU CAN. TAKE AN ARBITRATION AWARD BUT AND AND PETITION -- TO THE SUPERIOR COURT NOW THAT OVER TURNED OUT IF IF IF THAT SUCH A LAW WAS IF THE LAW WAS IMPROPERLY APPLIED THAT'S NOT TRUE I BELIEVE THAT IS THE CARE IS NO APPEAL PROCESS AND USE SO IF IF YOU IF. THEY'RE CERTAIN PROCEDURAL THINGS THAT IF THEY DON'T TO ARBITRATION ARE ELIGIBLE FOR APPEAL BUT FOR EXAMPLE BASIC RULES OF EVIDENCE OF CERTAIN THINGS THE ARBITER IT IS FREE. TO BE MORE FLEXIBLE WITH IN MANY CASES THIS ACCRUES TO THE BENTON BENEFITS OF PLAINTIFFS BECAUSE WHERE BLACK LETTER LAW MIGHT. WARRANT A SUMMARY JUDGMENT MOTION RIGHT DISCOVERY ANY OTHER. STATE DIFFERENT YEAH BUT GIVEN THE MERITS I WANT TO GIVE SOME TO THIS PLAINTIFF ANYWAY BUT APPLICATION OF THE LAW IF IT WAS IF IF. THE LAW WAS INCORRECTLY APPLIED TO THE FACTS THERE IS THE ABILITY TO PETITIONS TO SUPERIOR COURT TO OVERTURN I WOULD LET KNOW THAT THAT IS THAT NOT INCORRECT. STATEMENT LAW THAT IS AN INCORRECT STATEMENT HOW OLD. WE WOULD LIKE. THOSE CASES I'D LOVE TO SEE THEM BECAUSE THAT IS NOT MY UNDERSTANDING A LOT WELL IF I HAD THE STATUE IN FRONT OF ME I WOULD POINT OUT TO YOU BUT YET YEAH. THERE ARE LIMITED GROUNDS FOR AN APPEAL -- IT'S IN THAT COULD SILVER PROCEDURE UPON THE GROUNDS OF WHICH YOU CAN VACATE AN ARBITRATION AWARDS THERE ARE LIMITED GROUNDS THERE'S A COURT CASE CALL PEARSON DENTAL AND WHICH THEY SAID IF THE JUDGE HAS ARE EXCUSE ME THE ARBITRATOR HAS APPLIED THE LAW IN A WAY WHICH DENIES AT INDIVIDUAL. THEIR SUBSTANTIVE RIGHTS WAS DEALING WITH THE FOR ALL THAT TO SUPERIOR COURT IT'S PAST THERE HAS TO BE SOME BASIS TO APPEAL AN ARBITRATION AWARD OTHERWISE WE WOULDN'T HAVE ALL THIS JURISPRUDENCE OUT THERE WITH REGARD STARBIRD REACHING AGREEMENTS. AND ARBITRATION WORDS THAT HAVE BEEN ISSUED SO THERE ARE LIMITED GROUNDS IT'S NOT AS BROAD AS A CIVIL COURT CASE BUT THERE ARE GRANTS. TO SO ONCE AGAIN THERE IS THE LAW AND YES YOU CAN APPEAL -- BUT YOU KNOW I MEAN I LOVE THE STATEMENTS THAT ARE MADE WITHOUT ANY BACKUP OR ANY SUPPORT FOR THEM BUT CLEARLY THERE IS THE ABILITY TO APPEAL. AS I JUST STATED PREVIOUSLY WELL EXCEPT THAT THAT WAS INCORRECT STATEMENT BECAUSE BE ABLE TO APPEAL. A WHAT A ARBITRATOR GETS LAW WRONG THERE ARE CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES TO APPEAL. JUST AN INCORRECT APPLICATION A LAW. IS IT SO DID YOU JUST SAY THERE ARE CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES TO APPEAL VERY LIMITED THAT ARE MOSTLY AROUND DAY THANK YOU MISTER SANDERS OF THAT OF THE ARBITRATION BUT THE BROAD STATEMENT THAT YOU MAKE THAT. IF A ARBITRATOR GETS THE LAW WRONG THAT IS APPEALABLE TO THE COURT IS NOT CORRECT. THIS PETRIE-NORRIS JUST SO I CAN CAN CLARIFY SO. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THE POINT IS THIS LEGISLATION FROM THE AUTHOR IS NOT TO CHALLENGE WHETHER ARBITRATION IS IN FACT A FAIR EFFICIENT AND JUST MEANS OF RESOLVING DISPUTES IT'S SIMPLY. TO STATE THAT THAT HAS TO BE A A CONSENSUAL ARBITRATION RATHER THAN. MANDATORY CORRECT THE RIGHT NOT TO HAVE WHEN I ENTERED EIGHTY MONETARILY WE'RE NOT ACTUALLY GET BEATING THE MERITS OR ARBITRATION. IN THIS BOOK CORRECT THAT'S THAT'S CORRECT ABSOLUTELY. OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS. THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD I THINK THAT THERE ARE CLEARLY SOME FLAWS IN. THE WAY THAT THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION AGREEMENT OR FEDERAL CHASE ACT IS WRITTEN AND IT ENDS UP WITH VERY UNFAIR APPLICATION THAT WE HAVE POINTED OUT HERE AND I THINK IT'S OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO FIND THOSE THERE IS A CONTINUE TO PUSH. TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE THE AS POSSIBLE AND THE FACT THAT THESE THE POWER DIFFERENTIALS ARE SO STARK. THE FACT THAT. THERE ARE PLENTY OF CASES WHERE EMPLOYERS WILL REFUSE TO PAY AN ARBITRATOR OR DRAG THAT PROCESS OUT MEANS THAT IT IS NOT A AN EXPEDIA PROCESS IT IS NOT A QUICK PROCESS AND IT IS PART OF THE PRESSURE THAT EMPLOYERS SEEM TO BE PUTTING VERY WILLING TO PUT ON EMPLOYEES. TO NOT HAVE. CASES HEARD AND TO IT TO INTERFERE WITH WITH QUICK AND APPROPRIATE JUSTICE IN BECAUSE ARBITRATION CASES ARE REALLY NOT APPEALABLE IN. THE BROADER SENSE WHAT WE NORMALLY SEE AN APPEAL I THINK IT IS OUR OBLIGATION TO CONTINUE. TO PUSH THE LAW AND SEE MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE WAYS THAT WE ARE. PROTECTING THE PEOPLE WHO NEED US TO PROTECT THE MOST THAT'S HOW I READ THIS BILL AND I APPRECIATE THAT YOU HAVE BROUGHT IT FORWARD THANK YOU YOU MAY CLOSE MISTER. THANK YOU AND I AM I JUST WANNA CLOSE BY FIRST OF ALL ONCE AGAIN THINKING YOUR STAFF WHO DID AN INCREDIBLE JOB IN HELPING US CLEAN UP LANGUAGE -- AND IT WAS MUCH APPRECIATED I AM I ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT LIKE AGAIN THIS ISN'T ABOUT WHETHER ARBITRATION IS A GOOD VENUE I AM I'M A BELIEVER IN ARBITRATION IF IT'S ENTERED INTO VOLUNTARILY AND THERE'S SOME -- POWER BALANCE I I THINK IT'S A GOOD METHOD -- BUT I THINK ALL METHOD SHOULD BE ON THE TABLE WE WRITE -- CODE IT TO TO GO TO GOVERNMENT CUT IF HE HAD IT IS AN IMPORTANT FEATURE IN AND THAT THERE'S A REASON BEHIND THAT IN IN SHORING THAT WORKERS -- WHEN THEY ARE TAKING A JOB AREN'T TOLD BASICALLY YOUR LIVELIHOOD OR SIGNING AWAY THESE RIGHTS -- THAT THAT WE NEED TO EXAMINE THAT I THINK IT'S VERY NARROW WE'RE NOT TRYING TO UNDO ANY EXISTING ARBITRATION AGREEMENT WE'RE NOT TRYING TO UNDO ANY FUTURE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS PROVIDE INJUNCTIVE RELIEF. TO KEEP EMPLOYERS FROM FORCING AN ARBITRATION AGREEMENT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AND I THANK YOU THERE IS A MOTION TO SECOND THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS CALL THE ROLL PLEASE STONE BY STONE I GALLAGHER.

I THREE THREE TEN WOULD EXEMPT A PROBATION PAROLE CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS FROM ANY DUTY IN CRIMINAL MATT. ANY DUTY -- CHOI CHU YOU. CAN COME PEACE OFFICERS AT THE C. H. P. -- LOCAL POLICE OFFICERS AND COUNTY DEPUTIES. THIS BILL BEEN PASSES COMMITTEE SEVERAL TIMES I APPRECIATE AN AYE VOTE AND WE HAVE A COUPLE WITNESSES HERE AS WELL THANK YOU AND YOU ARE ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS AND THAT'S WHAT STARTED WITH. THANK YOU I STAYED HERE YOU THAT YOU ARE ACCEPTING THEM THANK YOU FIRST WITNESS PLEASE SOME MARKETING AND THE CHIEF PROBATION OFFICER WITH AMADOR COUNTY AND THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE TO TODAY TO TESTIFY. AND THEY THANK YOU TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER SANTIAGO FOR ASKING. ME TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF AB. THREE TEN AS YOU'VE HEARD AB THREE TEN WOULD CHANGE CURRENT STATUTE. TO EXEMPT PROBATION OFFICER FROM JURY DUTY IN CRIMINAL MATTERS. THIS IS IMPORTANT AS AN ARM OF THE COURT PROBATION OFFICERS HAVE PRE CONVICTION RESPONSIBILITIES SUCH AS OPERATING PRE TRIAL PROGRAMS. CONDUCTING RISK ASSESSMENTS AS WELL AS PREPARING REPORTS MAKING RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE BENCH REGARDING SUITABILITY IN ELIGIBILITY FOR PRE TRIAL MONITORING. THIS MAY INVOLVE TALKING TO DEFENDANTS THE VICTIMS AND OTHER IMPACTED PARTIES. FURTHER PROBATION OFFICERS ALSO HAVE SIGNIFICANT POST CONVICTION RESPONSIBILITIES INCLUDING SUPERVISION PROGRAMMING A PERSON'S A PROBATION MANDATORY SUPERVISION P. R. C. S.. JUST POST RELEASE CAN COMMUNITY SUPERVISION. AND SERVING OVER THIRTY NINE THOUSAND IS THAT THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. THIS ROLE PUTS OFFICERS OFFICERS IN A POSITION WHERE THE DEFENDANT IN A CRIMINAL TRIAL IS LIKELY TO BE UNDER OUR JURISDICTION FOR SUPERVISION AS WELL. WHICH CLEARLY CREATES AN INHERENT CONFLICT OF INTEREST TO HAVE OUR DEPARTMENTS COMPLETING REPORTS TO THE COURT. WHILE ALSO ULTIMATELY BEING RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SUPERVISION. AND REHABILITATION OF THOSE UNDER OUR JURISDICTION. ADDITIONALLY THERE HAVE BEEN INSTANCES WHERE APPEALS HAVE BEEN SOUGHT IN CRIMINAL CASES DUE TO HAVING PEACE OFFICERS PARTICULARLY A PROBATION OFFICER ON THE JURY. THIS IS THIS NOT ONLY DELAYS THE COURT PROCEEDINGS THE CAN BE EXTREMELY ONEROUS AND COSTLY FOR COURTS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT. AB THREE TEN WILL FIX THIS ISSUE. AND REMOVE THE INHERENT CONFLICT OF INTEREST IN OUR ROLE IN THE COURT TO ENSURE WE CAN CONTINUE TO BEST SERVE THE NEEDS OF THOSE UNDER OUR CARE. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY I WOULD LIKE TO PARTICULARLY THANK. THE CHAIR ASSEMBLY MEMBER STONE -- FOR WORKING WITH US ON AMENDMENTS. DIALOGUE WITH YOUR OFFICE I HEARD YOU TO SUPPORT AB. THREE TEN THANK YOU THAT'S WHAT DISPLACING. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS GREG STUPOR AND I'M THE LEGISLATIVE VICE PRESIDENT OF STATE COALITION INFORMATION ORGANIZATIONS COPO. A CO SPONSORS OF AB THREE TEN I'M ALSO THE PRESIDENT SEGMENT ACCOUNT INFORMATION ASSOCIATION. ONE OF THINK ASSEMBLYMEMBERS SANTIAGO FOR CARRYING THIS LEGISLATION. AND THINK THE CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE FOR CONSIDERATION OF THIS BILL. WE UNDERSTAND THE JURY DUTY EXEMPTIONS ARE LIMITED VERY SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES. IN LIGHT OF OUR CRITICAL ROLE IN PUBLIC SAFETY REALIGNMENT WE BELIEVE THAT PROBATION OFFICERS MEET THIS VERY HIGH BURDEN. FIRST AS PROBATION OFFICERS WE ON THE FRONTLINE OF REALIGNMENTS IMPLEMENTATION -- TASK WITH THE COMMUNITY SUPERVISION OF SERIOUS PROBLEMS YOU'VE BEEN SENTENCED TO PROBATION FOR THEIR CRIMES. ON A DAILY BASIS WE CONDUCT UNANNOUNCED HOME OR WORK VISIT SOME PROBATIONERS TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE COMPLYING WITH A COURT ORDERS. THEY ARE FOUND TO BE OUT OF COMPLIANCE OCCUR RESULT ARRESTOR REVOCATION OF PROBATION AND RETURN TO CUSTODY. WE ALSO CONDUCT PRE SENTENCING INVESTIGATIONS AND PREPARE PERCENT SING REPORTS FOR THE COURTS WHICH WILL MAKE SYNCING AND RESTITUTION RECOMMENDATIONS. IN SHORT WE ARE INVOLVED WITH THE FENDERS IN EVERY ASPECT OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM FROM ARREST. THE COURT PROCEDURES TO COMMUNITY SUPERVISION. AS A RESULT WE BELIEVE THAT OUR PERSONAL SAFETY MAY BE COMPROMISED BY REQUIRING US TO SERVE IN CRIMINAL JURIES. TO SERVE AS A JUROR IN A CRIMINAL TRIAL WERE FORCED TO DISCLOSE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION. WE THEY MAY BE REQUIRED TO SUPERVISE IN THE COMMUNITY THE VERY SAME DEFENDANT WE FOUND GUILTY AND SENTENCED. SAME DANGERS ARISE FOR REQUIRED TO SERVE ON JURIES INVOLVING CLOSE ASSOCIATES A PROBATIONERS. WE HAVE ARRESTED OR HAD TO VIOLATED PROBATION SOME BACK TO CUSTODY. THESE REASONS SCOPE OF RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT OF AB THREE TEN THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU. OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. BRIAN NELSON ABOUT THE AMERICAN FEDERATION OF STATE COUNTY MUNICIPAL EMPLOYEES ALSO A IN SUPPORT -- ON BEHALF OF OUR PROBATION DEPARTMENT WORKERS IN LOS ANGELES AND SANTA CLARA COUNTY RESPECTIVELY. LIKE THAT FOR YOUR STRONG SUPPORT. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. SEEING NONE IS THERE OPPOSITION. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR ANDY LEVON BOMB ON BEHALF OF THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL OF CALIFORNIA. THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL REGRETFULLY MUST OPPOSE AB -- THREE TEN I THINK IS THIS COMMITTEE HAS HEARD BEFORE STATUTORY EXEMPTIONS. ARE VERY HARD ON THE JUDICIAL BRANCH REDUCES THE NUMBER OF AVAILABLE JURORS MAKES IT MORE DIFFICULT TO SELECT REPRESENTATIVE JURIES. AND UNFAIRLY INCREASES THE BURDEN OF JURY SERVICE ON OTHER SEGMENTS OF THE POPULATION. THE COURTS HAVE A CONSTITUTIONAL OBLIGATION TO ENSURE THAT JURY POOLS ARE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE COMMUNITIES THAT THEY SERVE. AND THAT THERE ARE ENOUGH PERSPECTIVE JURORS IN THE COURTHOUSE EACH DAY TO AVOID HAVING TO DISMISS. EXCUSE ME DISMISS LAST DAY CRIMINAL TO FOR LACK OF JURORS. EXISTING LAW AND THE CALIFORNIA RULES OF COURT MAKE CATEGORICAL LOOKS EXCEPTIONS UNNECESSARY BECAUSE BOTH AUTHORIZED COURTS TO GRANT A HARDSHIP EXCUSE IN APPROPRIATE CIRCUMSTANCES. AND TO MAKE SCHEDULING ACCOMMODATIONS WITHOUT REQUIRING A COURT APPEARANCE INCLUDING WANTED JURORS SERVICES ARE IMMEDIATELY NEEDED FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY THAT. STATEMENT IS EMBODIED IN CALIFORNIA RULES OF COURT TWO POINT. ONE ZERO ZERO EIGHT ALSO MANY CHANGES IN RECENT YEARS DESIGNED SPECIFICALLY TO LESSEN THE BURDEN OF JURY DUTY ON CITIZENS ALSO RENDER CATEGORICAL EXEMPTIONS UNNECESSARY. SUCH CHANGES INCLUDE CREATION OF A ONE DAY ONE TRIAL SYSTEM THAT IS STATEWIDE NOW. IMPROVING SOMEONE'S PROCESS TO ALLOW REQUESTS FOR EXCUSES TO BE MADE AND ADOPTION OF A RULE OF COURT TO ENSURE THAT JURORS CAN REQUEST GOD WILLING ACCOMMODATIONS WITHOUT NEEDING TO APPEAR IN COURT. COURTS MUST CONSTANTLY BALANCE THE NEED TO ENSURE ACCESS TO THE JUSTICE SYSTEM WITH THE NEED TO RESPECT JURORS TIMES. HOWEVER WHAT JURY SERVICE REQUIRE SACRIFICE ON THE PART OF CITIZENS. EXEMPTING CERTAIN CLASSES OF INDIVIDUALS ON THE BASIS OF THE BURDEN IT MIGHT PUT ON THEM UNFAIRLY INCREASES THE BURDEN ON OTHERS. NOW WITH REGARDS TO THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS ARE POLICY COMMITTEE HAS NOT YET HAD A TIME TO REVIEW THEM AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO REVIEWING THEM WE MIGHT ALSO RECOMMEND. THAT IF THERE IS REPORTING TO BE DONE THAT PERHAPS THAT REPORTING SHOULD BE DONE PRIOR TO A CATEGORICAL EXEMPTION BEING PUT INTO PLACE THANK YOU THANK YOU. CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS ERIN RAY BURKE AND I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA JUDGES ASSOCIATION AND RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION TO AB. THREE TEN I WOULD SECOND -- THE COMMENTS MADE FROM OUR PARTNERS AT THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL AN AD THAT CJ HAS HAD IT HAS HELD A HISTORIC. OPPOSITION RIGHT LINE OPPOSITION HIS FROM JURY SERVICE. PLEASE DO NOT TAKE THIS POSITION AS ONE OF OPPOSITION TO OUR CORRECTIONAL AND PAROLE PARTNERS IT IS NOT WE ARE OPPOSED TO ANY BILL THAT WOULD UNDERMINE THE DIVERSE AND REPRESENTATIVE NATURE OF JURY POLLS. AS IF THIS BILL WERE TO PASS. THE LEGISLATURE IS INVITING A TREMENDOUS EROSION IN TO THE RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL BECAUSE OF THE SHRINKAGE OF THE JURY AVAILABLE JURY PAUL. AND AS THAT SHIP IN THAT SHRINKAGE WILL GROW AS OTHER POWERFUL GROUPS LOBBY FOR FOR EQUAL TREATMENT. FOR THOSE REASONS AND MORE CJ RESPECTFULLY OPPOSES AB. THREE TEN THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. RIGHT SIGNAL I'M GONNA BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. SO I HAVE LONG BEEN OPPOSED. TO THESE EXEMPTIONS TO JURY SERVICE JURY DUTY IS ONE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL OBLIGATIONS THAT WE SERVE. AS CITIZENS OF THIS COUNTRY AND IF WE'RE GOING TO WHICH WE HAVE AS OF LEGISLATIVE BODY WE HAVE EXEMPTED CERTAIN FOLKS BECAUSE OF POLITICAL PRESSURE BECAUSE OF ANY. A NUMBER OF OTHER REASONS AND FOR ME LAST YEAR WE SAW THIS BILL AND WE EXEMPTED. OR WE WE CARVED OUT. THE CIVIL TRIALS BECAUSE THE THE ARGUMENTS THAT ARE MADE REALLY DO NOT APPLY TO CIVIL TRIALS. AND THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE TAKEN UP LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY THAN IT WAS IN PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE. BUT IT WASN'T AND IT PASSED BUT MY FUNDAMENTAL CONCERN STILL REMAIN. AND EVEN IF ULTIMATELY THIS IS A PILOT PROGRAM AND IT REQUIRES SOME REPORTING BACK. BECAUSE IF WE'RE GOING TO SERIOUSLY CONSIDER PROBATION OFFICERS AND I DO DISAGREE WITH SOME OF THE PROMISE OF WHY BECAUSE PROBATION OFFICERS WORK. AFTER THE FACT NOT BEFORE THE FACT AND SO THAT DOES BEFORE THAT THAT CONNECTION THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT THERE'S NECESSARILY A CONFLICT WHEN A PROBATION OFFICER IS. CALLED WHO CAN BE FAIR. IN A JURY GETS AT LEAST -- CONVICTION THEY MAY HAVE INTERACTIONS WITH THOSE PEOPLE OR PEOPLE OF SIR SIMILAR CLASS LATER ON BUT THAT'S DURING THE PROBATION PERIOD THAT'S NOT. AT THE TRIAL BECAUSE BE IN. BEING A PROBATIONARY PERIOD MEANS THAT THAT THERE IS A CONVICTION [inaudible] SO THAT. THE THIS AROSE IN THIS KIND OF CONSTANT AND WE GET THIS REQUEST ALL THE TIME WHERE PEOPLE WANT TO BE EXEMPTED FROM JURY SERVICE BECAUSE IT'S IN CAN BE IN IT'S DIFFICULT TO DO. AT SOME POINT WE HAVE TO STOP THE REQUEST SO IF WE'RE GOING TO CONSIDER. PROBATION OFFICERS WHICH I TAKE IT AS A AS A VALID. REQUEST THAT I THINK EVEN THE JUDICIAL COUNCILS CONCERNS THAT WERE RAISED IN THE AND THE PROCESSES THAT ARE PUT IN PLACE THERE ARE MORE. THAT PROTECT AGAINST BIAS SO IF THE IF A PROBATION OFFICER DOES HAVE IN EXHIBITS THE BIAS OR A CONNECTS TO THE CASE THEY COULD BE REMOVED FOR COST BY THE JUDGE SO THERE ARE OTHER. MECHANISMS THAT THE COURTS HAVE IN PLACE. BUT IF WE DON'T IF WE'RE GOING TO TAKE ANY STEPS LIKE THIS WE HAVE TO START TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE DATA BECAUSE SO FAR GROUPS TO COME FORWARD AND ASKING THE GIVE US ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE THEY GIVE US. A MOTIONAL PEELS THEY SAY WE SHOULD BE EXEMPTED BECAUSE WITHOUT PROVIDING ANY DATA WITHOUT SHOWING WHAT THE IMPACT IS ON THE COURTS OR WHAT THE NECESSITY IS. SO WHAT WE'VE PROPOSED AS AMENDMENTS TO THIS BILL IS A PILOT PROGRAM. AND REPORTING BACK SO THAT WE REALLY GET OUR HANDS AROUND WHETHER THIS WOULD BE WHAT THE IMPACT OF REMOVING PROBATION OFFICERS FROM JURY POOLS WOULD BE. WHETHER OR NOT IT'S IT'S ULTIMATELY NECESSARY AND IF ALSO SETS A PROCESS WITH THE WHICH I'M HOPING THAT IF THERE ARE OTHER GROUPS TO COME FORWARD TO MAKE THIS REQUEST EVEN. IF ULTIMATELY PROBATION OFFICERS GET THEIR WISH THAT ARE ALLOWED TO BE EXCLUDED FROM JURY POOLS. THEN WE HAVE A PROCESS BY WHICH WE CAN ASK OTHER ORGANIZATIONS TO COME FORWARD AND ESTABLISH FOR US WHY THEY SHOULD BE REMOVED WHAT THE IMPACT IS. AND THAT GIVES US I HOPE THE BETTER ABILITY TO SAY NO OR IF THEY CAN ESTABLISH THE REASON FOR BEING REMOVED FOR JURY POOLS. WE KNOW EXACTLY WHY RATHER THAN SPECULATION. EMOTIONAL ARGUMENT BECAUSE A LOT OF IT GETS DOWN TO THE FACT THAT PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO SERVE ON JURIES. AND THAT IS NOT ACCEPTABLE TO ME AND IT SHOULD BE ACCEPTABLE TO THIS COMMITTEE SO WHAT WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO PUT IN PLACE IS A BIT OF PROCESS BY WHICH WE CAN TEST THE PROMISE. GET SOME INFORMATION BACK AND HOPEFULLY BETTER UNDERSTAND WHAT THE IMPLICATIONS ARETHAT'S REALLY WHAT WE'RE ASKING IF WE'RE GOING TO MOVE THIS FORWARD AND WE PROBABLY SHOULD TO THE POINT. NOT ALLOW. THIS EXEMPTION UNTIL WE COLLECT THE DATA BUT BECAUSE A PROBATION OFFICERS HAVE BEEN ASKING FOR THAT. THAT THEIR INVOLVEMENT THERE IS THERE IS SOME CREDIBLE ARGUMENT TO IT I'M NOT SURE I COMPLETELY BY ALL THE ARGUMENTS BUT AT LEAST ENOUGH OF A CREDIBLE ARGUMENT. THAT'S LET'S. ALLOW A PILOT PERIOD TO REALLY STUDY THIS TO LOOK AT THIS THEN WE'LL KNOW BETTER WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH THAT'S WHAT I'M ASKING I NOTICE OR SANTIAGO IS NOT HAPPY WITH THIS PROCESS. BUT I REALLY HOPE THAT WE CAN MAKE SURE. THAT THIS THIS MOVES FOR THAT THIS MOVES THROUGH. BECAUSE YOU DO THAT WITH THE AMENDMENTS THAT I APPRECIATE THAT BUT THAT I DO HOPE THAT THIS MOVES FOR THROUGH THAT THAT GIVES US SOME TANGIBLE. EVIDENCE THAT WE CAN WORK WITH WHETHER WHETHER IT'S AROUND PROBATION OFFICERS OR OTHERS. AS WE GET THIS REQUEST BECAUSE I PROMISE YOU IF WE GRANT THIS REQUEST WE WILL START GETTING MORE AND MORE AND MORE. AND THAT GETS HARDER AND HARDER AND HARDER FOR ME IT IS SOMETHING I THINK WE SHOULD DEFINITELY TAKE VERY SERIOUSLY. BUT THE CAR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I DO APPRECIATE -- YOU'RE SAFEGUARDING HUH -- OF THE IT IN MANY WAYS THE TRYING TO MAINTAIN THE INTEGRITY OF THE SYSTEM INTEGRITY OF THE JURY SELECTION PROCESS KNOWING THAT OFTENTIMES. IT'S IT'S A CHALLENGE TO GET PEOPLE EVEN WANT PARTICIPATE IN AND IN INJURIES AND I KNOW SUPPORT FROM FOLKS OF OF THOSE OF US THAT HAVE. HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN JURY SELECTION IN. HERE THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF EXCUSES PEOPLE. PRESUMABLY IS WILL OF ALL ASSUME THAT THEY'RE ALL -- OF THE UTMOST INTEGRITY BUT THE REALITY IS THAT THERE ARE. OFTENTIMES EFFORTS TO TRY TO GET OUT OF SERVING ON JURIES AND I KNOW THAT IT'S ALWAYS A CHALLENGE FOR JUDGES -- TO BE ABLE TO EMPANEL A JURY I WILL SAY -- AND I DO APPRECIATE THE REPORT AND AND TRYING TO AT LEAST GET A GRASS GONNA HANDLE. OF WHAT KIND OF IMPACT OF THESE KINDS OF EXEMPTIONS HAVE ON THE SYSTEM. AND I'LL SAY AS A A FORMER -- Là DEBBIE PUBLIC DEFENDER THAT WHO HAD A FRANKLY A GREAT RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR PROBATION APARTMENT PROBATION OFFICERS. I DON'T THINK I WOULD HAVE ALLOWED A PROBATION OFFICER. NOW WHAT IS THAT BECAUSE OF MY OWN BIASES OR BECAUSE OF IT'S PRIDE MORE ANECDOTAL THAN IT IS STATISTICAL -- IN TERMS OF BIASES AND IT'S NOT THAT THE PROBATION OFFICERS WERE BIASED PER SE. I JUST THINK THAT HAVING SUCH AN IN DEPTH KNOWLEDGE OF THE THE CASES OF THE COME A JUST SYSTEM OF OUR CLIENTS -- BOTH BEFORE AND AFTER TRIAL INCLUDING. THEIR THEIR SLIP UPS AT TIMES -- I I JUST THINK IT'S AN INTIMATE KNOWLEDGE OF OF THE SYSTEM THAT AND THAT I BELIEVE WARRANTS. THAT EXEMPTION BUT I DO APPRECIATE YOUR CONCERN BECAUSE I THINK IT'S A REAL ONE THAT. THERE IS A SLIPPERY SLOPE WORRY HERE THAT -- YOU CAN KIND OF MAKE THAT ARGUMENT AND AND PROBABLY A LOT OF OTHER AREAS AS WELL ALTHOUGH I DO THINK WITH PROBATION. THAT IT'S WITH ITS -- THE THE BASE OFFICER SO INTIMATELY INVOLVED -- BUT THE DAY TO DAY OPERATIONS OF I THINK IT'S FAIR TO AT LEAST -- HAVE SOME KIND OF FOLLOW UP -- THE TO THE TO THE TO THIS BILL IF IT DOES MAKE IT ALL THE WAY -- TO THE GOVERNOR'S DESK ASSIGNED -- RATHER THAN JUST CREATING AN EXEMPTION AND KIND OF JUST NOT NOT LOOKING BACK AND SO I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING WHAT THE RESULTS OF A OF A SUBSEQUENT REPORT WOULD BE. AND I KNOW THAT I HAVE A A LOT OF FORMER COLLEAGUES MOTHER HAPPY THAT WE JUST SAY TO MUCH PRESS THREE CHALLENGES. WELL A AND THE THE PROPERTY CHALLENGE IS PART OF THIS BECAUSE THIS COMMITTEES ALWAYS PUSH BACK ON REDUCTION APPROACH TO CHALLENGES THAT WAS PUT IN BUDGET TRAILER LANGUAGE IN THERE NOW OR LIMITATIONS ON IT. IN THE PAST THE PUBLIC DEFENDERS AND OTHERS INVOLVED IN COURT WERE OPPOSED TO THESE TWO OF MY THREE PROBATION OFFICERS IN THE COUNTIES THAT I REPRESENT OR HAVE BEEN OPPOSED. BUT ONE OF THE CHALLENGES NOW BECAUSE OF THE LIMITATION OF PEREMPTORY CHALLENGES. IS THAT PUBLIC DEFENDERS AND OTHERS DON'T WANT TO USE THOSE FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THAT'S WHY. LET'S GET SOME DATA LET'S FIGURE OUT WHAT'S REAL AND THEN SEE WHAT WHAT THE LANDSCAPE LOOKS LIKE AND AGAIN. I'M WILL IF THIS IS GOING TO BE APPROVED AND SPECIFICALLY FOR PROBATION OFFICERS I'M LESS CONCERNED BUT I'M MORE CONCERNED WITH THE NEXT GROUP THAT ASKS AND THE NEXT GROUP THAT ASKS AND THE NEXT GROUP THAT ASKS BECAUSE THEY WELL. AND AT SOME POINT I WON AFFIRMATIVELY STOP THAT SLIDE. MR. TO AND THEN MISTER GALLAGHER. THIS GONZALEZ I JUST WANT TO BRIEFLY SAY I PROBABLY EIGHT APSLEY GROWTH OUR COLLEAGUE FROM SAN JOSE THAT -- THAT I DON'T THINK ANYBODY'S WANT TO EXPAND -- THE CATEGORIES THAT ARE ALLOWED TO BE EXEMPTED BUT I THINK FOR MANY THE SAME REASONS -- I AM -- I'D I DO THINK THIS MAKES SENSE AND WITH THAT I AM HAPPY TO AS HAPPY AMENDED. THANK YOU THERE'S A MOTION AS THEIR SECOND AND THE SECOND THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT -- MISTER GALLAGHER. YEAH I DO THINK IN THIS SPECIFIC SITUATION -- IT MAKES SENSE THE ONE I MEAN BECAUSE OUR PROBATION OFFICERS HAVE HUGE CASELOADS ESPECIALLY NOW IN THE AFTERMATH OF AB -- ONE OH NINE AND THERE HAVE THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES OF GREATLY INCREASED IN TERMS OF MONITORING AND AND YOU KNOW THOSE ON ON YOUR EARLY RELEASE -- SO YOU KNOW TO TAKE THEM OFF OF THOSE DUTIES YOU KNOWIS. YOU KNOW IS POTENTIALLY A PUBLIC SAFETY THREAT I THINK AND SO. I THINK THERE'S A SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCE IN THAT RESPECT AND EVEN THOUGH THEIR DUTIES DO USUALLY COME AND POST CONVICTION. ESPECIALLY IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE WORLD MANY OF THESE FOLKS THIS ISN'T THEIR FIRST RODEO -- AND SO YOU KNOW AT THAT TERMINAL. THE JURY SYSTEM YOU KNOW THERE IS THAT. THAT GREAT POTENTIAL THAT THEY'VE SEEN MANY THESE PEOPLE ANOTHER OTHER CONTEXTS -- BEFORE SO. FOR THOSE FOR THOSE SPECIFIC REASONS I THINK IT IS WARRANTED. THANK YOU THIS GONZALEZ. I AM I AM. CONFLICTED ABOUT THE AMENDMENTS. WELL HOPEFULLY OF THE CAN THAT GO SOLVE SOME OF THAT PROBLEM WITH THE WITH THE BUDGET OUT OKAY THAT I JUST WANTED TO TO MAKE SURE AT THIS ENTIRE BILL I'M CONFLICTED AYE AYE. EIGHT TEND TO AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUES -- FROM NORTHERN CALIFORNIA ABOUT THE APPROPRIATENESS OF A PROBATION OFFICER SIT ON JURIES AND I THINK IT'S KIND OF A AT WHAT. I MEAN I DON'T KNOW I'D LIKE TO KNOW HOW MANY HAVE EVER BEEN EVEN CHOSEN TO BE SEATED ON A JURY ONCE THEY SHOW UP AND THAT WOULD BE INTERESTING. INFORMATION TO ME THAT BEING SAID I ALSO AGREE WITH THE CHAIR THAT THIS IS A SPIRAL THAT WE CAN GET INTO AND WE SEE IT WITH JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING. AND WE NEED JERRY SO AYE AYE. CONFLICTED IN GENERAL I JUST WANT WE HAVE A TENDENCY AT AND TO NOT -- TO NOT MOVE REPORT BILLS -- THROUGH THE PROCESS AND SO AT IN THAT'S NOT JUST ON THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE BUT THE OTHER SIDE AS WELL SO. THAT THE DESIRE TO GO SEEK BUDGET LANGUAGE AND AND A BUDGET REQUEST WOULD BE -- HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. I'LL BE VOTING FOR THIS TODAY THIS RARE. CLEARLY AFFECT IT SEEMS LIKE ALL THE ATTORNEYS ARE SPEAKING UP -- I I WOULD TEND TO AGREE. I WOULD TEND TO AGREE WITH THAT WITH THE COMMENTS MADE I THINK THAT THE THE THE ONLY. GOOD THING ABOUT THIS IS THAT THEY CAN STILL SERVE ON CIVIL TRIAL CIVIL MATTERS. SO THAT THEY'RE NOT COMPLETELY EXCLUDED FROM JURY SERVICE AND IT APPEARS THAT THEY WERE PROBABLY ONE TIRED -- IN MOST CRIMINAL CASES. BUT I AGREE WITH THE CHAIR -- THIS IS A SLIPPERY SLOPE. I WILL BE VOTING ON THIS TODAY -- BECAUSE THEY CANCER OF ON CIVIL MATTERS. THANK YOU OTHER QUESTIONS COVER. RIGHT. THIS WHOLE. WE'LL HEAR FROM A NON ATTORNEY THAT'S WHY I'M GONNA. AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUES AS A NON ATTORNEY. ALL RIGHT WE CHECK THAT BOX. ALL RIGHT THAT WAS SUCH A AGREEMENT CLOSE. THANK YOU ALSO THE NON ATTORNEY. WELL LOOK I MEAN LOOK REAL ONE ARE BILLS TO GET THERE AND THAT'S THE IMPORTANT PART BUT WE ALSO APPRECIATE A GOOD THOUGHTFUL APPROACH AND DISCUSSION -- SO LOOK I'M APPRECIATIVE OF THE THOUGHTFUL APPROACH AND THE SHOW THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS WORKS -- AND I JUST WANTED TO COUPLE THINGS THOUGH I MEAN IN TERMS OF I DO AGREE THAT THERE IS A PLAYED A CASELOAD AND A PUBLIC GOOD TO HAVING PEOPLE AT THEIR DESKS -- WORKING AS MUCH AS THEY CAN'T PARTICULARLY OVER IN A CONVERSATION ABOUT RESTORATIVE JUSTICE PARTICULARLY WHEN WE WANT PEOPLE TO GET ON A BETTER PATH -- AND THAT'S ONE REASON THAT THE BILL AN OFFICER -- DEPENDS ON WHETHER YOU LIKE THE PRO TO THE PROBATION OFFICER DURING -- DURING A JURY -- PROCEEDING MAY HELP YOU IF YOU DON'T LIKE THE APPROACH OF A POLICE OFFICER MAY MAY HURT YOU BUT THEY KNOW A LITTLE BIT MORE. ABOUT IT'S THAT JUST DEPENDS ON WHAT YOUR APPROACHES AND SO I DECIDED THAT. THAT'S ABOUT IT POINT AND THEN I WOULD ARGUE THAT IN SOME CASES THEY DO HAVE -- THEY MAY KNOW THE THE PARTICULAR -- DEFENDANT -- BECAUSE YOU YOU WE TALKED ABOUT THEM -- THAT THERE'S A CONVICTION AFTER THE TRIAL BUT SOME OF THESE PEOPLE MAY BE ON PROBATION WHEN THEY'RE GOING THROUGH THE PROCESS LIMITED AMOUNT BUT THIS IS WHAT WILL HAPPEN DURING THE A STUDY IN WILL HAVE A BETTER IDEA OF THAT -- I'M REALLY HAPPY ABOUT THE GETTING THIS BILL OUT HOPEFULLY AND SO HIGH I APPRECIATE THE THE TOP APPROACH THAT MR.
