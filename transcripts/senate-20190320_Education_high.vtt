FIRST TIME WE TRIED CANNABIS

00:23:41.486 --> 00:23:43.021

00:24:03.341 --> 00:24:05.010
NOT FAIR THAT THIS MEDICINE IS

IN FIVE THOUSAND YEARS NO ONE

00:24:20.592 --> 00:24:22.961
HAS DIED FROM CANNABIS USE.

00:24:23.028 --> 00:24:24.496
IT IS THE ONLY MEDICINE THAT CAN

00:24:24.563 --> 00:24:26.231
TREAT SO MANY DIFFERENT ELEMENTS

00:24:26.298 --> 00:24:28.166

TO PARKINSON'S.

00:24:32.938 --> 00:24:34.306

VERY AGAINST TRYING CANNABIS --

00:25:09.441 --> 00:25:11.509
BUT THE UPDATE SINCE THEN IS

00:25:11.576 --> 00:25:13.078
THAT HE'S LEARNED HIS ABCS.

00:25:13.144 --> 00:25:14.346
AND HE KNOWS HOW TO COUNT.

00:25:14.412 --> 00:25:17.482

00:25:17.549 --> 00:25:19.184

00:25:19.251 --> 00:25:19.885
THE MIRACLE MEDICATION THAT

00:25:19.951 --> 00:25:21.286
SAVED HIS LIFE IT'S REQUIRED FOR

00:25:21.353 --> 00:25:22.854
SEIZURE CONTROL WITHOUT FORCING

00:25:22.921 --> 00:25:23.955
HIM OUT OF THE CLASSROOM BECAUSE

00:25:24.022 --> 00:25:25.023
OF OUTDATED LAWS AND

00:25:25.090 --> 00:25:26.524

EACH DAY WE GO TO SCHOOL TO

00:25:31.162 --> 00:25:33.531
POINT OUT OF CLASS WALKING A

00:25:33.598 --> 00:25:35.834
THOUSAND FEET FROM CAMPUS.

00:25:35.901 --> 00:25:36.735
AND GIVEN THAT TO BRING HIM BACK.

00:25:36.801 --> 00:25:38.737
THIS WHOLE PROCESS TAKES ABOUT

00:25:38.803 --> 00:25:39.371
THIRTY MINUTES AND THAT'S ON A

00:25:39.437 --> 00:25:40.105
GOOD DAY.

00:25:40.171 --> 00:25:42.140
THAT ACCOUNTS 410% OF HIS DAY AT

00:25:42.207 --> 00:25:43.308
SCHOOL.

00:25:43.375 --> 00:25:45.143

TIME THAT RECALL THAT IS

00:25:55.954 --> 00:25:57.489
REQUIRED WHEN HE COMES BACK TO

CLASS WE HAVE TO PULL HIM FROM.

00:25:59.157 --> 00:25:59.958

HIS MEDICAL NEEDS AND THE

AND THAT TEN BILLION IS A

00:35:09.340 --> 00:35:10.708
CONSTRAINT NUMBER BECAUSE WE

00:35:10.775 --> 00:35:12.343
LIMIT HOW MANY PROJECTS THE

00:35:12.410 --> 00:35:14.479
CAMPUS CAN REQUEST SO THERE'S

00:35:14.545 --> 00:35:15.880
PROBABLY GREATER NEED BUT BASED

00:35:15.947 --> 00:35:17.348
ON THE AVAILABLE FUNDS WE

00:35:17.415 --> 00:35:18.716
CONSTRAIN THAT AMOUNT.

00:35:18.783 --> 00:35:20.318
WE HAVE A FIVE YEAR PLAN WE

00:35:20.384 --> 00:35:22.086

00:35:24.989 --> 00:35:25.990
THE FIVE YEARS FORWARD.

00:35:26.057 --> 00:35:29.694
IT INCLUDES THOSE PROJECTS THAT

00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:32.196
WOULD BE.

00:35:32.263 --> 00:35:33.764

00:35:42.340 --> 00:35:43.641
WE'VE DONE IN THE CSU IS WE

00:35:43.708 --> 00:35:45.343
