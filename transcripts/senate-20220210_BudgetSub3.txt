S. T. THANK YOU. IN A PRESS. THE PRESS- EXCEPT QUESTION. WHY KNOW WILL DIG MORE INTO IT WHEN YOU WHEN WE TALK MORE SPECIFICALLY ABOUT ICE TEA BUT- GIVEN THE POPULATION IN YOUR HOUSEHOLD WHAT WHAT IS ETERNAL I GUESS- THE TURNOVER RATE SO- THE PEOPLE HOW HOW LONG PEOPLE TEND TO STAY IN THESE HIGH RELEASE OF LOTS OF DIFFERENT CATEGORIES AND SO FORTH SO RIGHT SO YOU HAVE. ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED NINETY BEDS WILL TRY TRY TO PUSH THAT UP TO FIVE THOUSAND SEVEN FORTY. POINT TWENTY THREE AT LEAST POSITION. AND- AND BUT IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW WHAT TO THE TOUCH I GUESS THE TURNOVER RATE AND THESE POPULATIONS FOR THE LENGTH OF STAY IN OUR YEAH THE LENGTH OF STAY I DOUBT REDUCE LENGTH OF STAY- YEAH. AND I CAN CERTAINLY ANSWER THAT QUESTION- IT REALLY VARIES DEPENDING ON THE COMMITMENT TYPE- BUT IN THE- END THE PURPOSE FOR WHICH INDIVIDUALS HAVE BEEN COMMITTED TO THE DEPARTMENT- ARE WE HAVE SOME POPULATIONS THAT TURN AROUND. PRETTY QUICKLY WHICH WOULD BE ARE INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL I'M PATIENTS AS WELL AS INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE COMMITTED FROM THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS ARE CURRENT INMATES WHO ARE JUST RECEIVING. A TREATMENT AT THE HOSPITAL AND LEVEL AND THEN RETURNED BACK TO CDC ARE FOR THEIR- FOR THAT ARE AND CONTINUE TO A MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT. AND OTHER COMMITMENTS- HAVE. YOU NO LONGER COMMITMENT TIME FRAMES CERTAINLY SOME OF OUR LONGER AND COMMITMENTS ARE THE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE COMMITTED TO SS SEXUALLY VIOLENT PREDATORS- OFTEN WE HAVE INDIVIDUALS- UNDER THE MANAGEMENT PATRICK SHORT ACT THAT COULD YOU. CAN STAY A LITTLE BIT LONGER AS WELL AS INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE COMMITTED AS OFFENDERS WITH MENTAL HEALTH DISORDERS. AND THEN FINALLY THE NOT GUILTY BY REASON OF INSANITY AND INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE COMMITTED UNDER THAT COMMITMENT COACH THEY ARE COMMITTED TO US FOR THE SAME AMOUNT OF TIME THAT THEY WOULD HAVE RECEIVED A CRIMINAL SENTENCE IF THEY WOULD HAVE. BEEN FOUND GUILTY AND NOT BEEN FOUND GUILTY BY REASON OF INSANITY SO THOSE TERMS CAN OFTEN BE LONG DEPENDING ON THE CRIME IN WHICH THE AND THEY WERE FOUND NOT GUILTY BY REASON OF INSANITY. AT THAT OKAY SO I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND- WHAT YOU'RE SAYING. BUT THIS IS ALSO BUDGET COMMITTEE SOMEONE BE MORE QUANTITATIVE SO LONG AS HOW LONG SO AND I REALIZE YOU HAVE RIGHT SO FOR EXAMPLE. THE ENCOMPASSED ENTRIES THAT ARE SHORTER SO WHAT IS THE AVERAGE LENGTH OF STAY OF SOMEONE WHO IS REFERRED TO AND I REALIZE IT'S DIFFERENT EACH DIFFERENT CASES THERE BUT WHAT IS THE AVERAGE LENGTH OF STAY. FOR SOMEONE WHO'S IN. AND COMPTANT STAND TRIAL VERSES. AND I KNOW YOU KNOW YOU DON'T AND YOU DON'T HAVE IT SO I JUST GOTTA GET THAT'S WHAT THE AVERAGE LENGTH OF STAY IN THESE HOSPITALS AND IF. YOU HAVE BY THE CATEGORIES THAT'S GREAT IF YOU DOWN JUST JUST A SENSE OF WHAT IS NOW HOW LONG IS LONG HOW SHORTAGE. SO LET US OF A BOOK FOR THE IN. TO TRIAL. IN A IT'S REALLY TO THAT THINGS ARE GOING A LITTLE BIT DURING THE- OR- THAT'S ABOUT FREE. RATES AND SO TOOK. FOR WHO AT WHO ARE CA AS- TO STAND AND TO THIS HOUSE. WE TURN OUR SOMEWHERE THE HOME AND FIFTY DAY MARK- AND IN BEING INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE TREATED IN OUR JAIL BASED COMPETENCY TREATMENT PROGRAMS THOSE ARE DESIGNED TO TREAT INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE GOING TO RESTORE MORE QUICKLY. THEY OFTEN HAD I'M COMMITMENTS LESS THAN NINETY DAYS OR HARD AND EVERY TURN TECH COMPETENCY WITHIN NINETY DAYS AND THOSE WHO DON'T RESTORE QUICKLY. ARE THEN TRANSFERRED TO A STATE HOSPITAL FOR CONTINUED TREATMENT- SO AND THEN IN THE COMMUNITY BASED RESTORATION PROGRAMS THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE COUNTING COMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL. ARE REMAIN IN THAT COMMITMENT A LITTLE BIT LONGER I'M ALMOST UP TO THE TWO YEAR COMMITMENT TIME FRAME THAT'S BECAUSE IT'S DESIGNED TO BEING OF LONGER TERM COMMUNITY BASED TREATMENT- THAT'S PREPARING THEM BURKE CONNECTION TO COMMUNITY BASED TREATMENT AFTER THEIR COMMITMENT TIME. ON COMPARING THAT TO SOMEBODY WHO IS ANNIE ON SEXUALLY VIOLENT PREDATOR THEY CAN BE AND FOR YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW THAT.

AND THE BUDGET THE PROPOSED BUDGET INCLUDES NINETY THREE MILLION IN THE CURRENT YEAR AND FIVE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY ONE MILLION GENERAL FUND. IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE AN ONGOING IN ASSOCIATED TRAILER BILL FOR THE DEPARTMENT TO IMPLEMENT SEVERAL SOLUTIONS RELATED TO INCREASING ACCESS TO SERVICES FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE FOUND IN COMPANIES TO STAND TRIAL ON FELONY CHARGES AND THESE INCLUDE STABILIZATION. AND EARLY ACCESS TO TREATMENT CARE COORDINATION AND WAIT LIST MANAGEMENT AND SIGNIFICANTLY EXPANDING COMMUNITY BASED RESTORATION AND DIVERSION OPPORTUNITIES. IN ADDITION TO THE SOLUTIONS THE PROPOSAL ALSO INCLUDES IMPLEMENTING A BROKE CAP ON HIGHEST YOU REFERRALS FOR ALL COUNTIES THAT'S AIMED AT ENCOURAGING THE EXPANSION OF COMMUNITY CARE BUT GUARDING AGAINST ANY UNINTENDED INCENTIVES THAT MIGHT DRIVE INCREASED. ON THE HIGHEST HE REFERRALS. RIGHT BACKGROUND ON THIS. AS WE ALL KNOW CALIFORNIA AS HOME TO THOUSANDS OF VULNERABLE INDIVIDUALS WITH SERIOUS BEHAVIOR HEALTH CONDITIONS IN MANY OF THESE INDIVIDUALS CYCLE IN AND OUT OF HOMELESSNESS IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. I AM VERY REASON THIS HAPPENS IS BECAUSE OF GAPS AS YOU NOTED I'M SURE. IN THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CARE CONTINUUM IN UPSTREAM TREATMENT AND SUPPORT INTERVENTIONS CAN BEING UNAVAILABLE SOME INDIVIDUALS BECOME IMPAIRED TO A POINT WHERE ENGAGEMENT IN TREATMENT IS DIFFICULT. INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE ACCUSED AND ARRESTED FOR CRIME AND WHO AS A RESULT OF THEIR BEHAVIOR HEALTH CONDITION ARE UNABLE TO UNDERSTAND THEIR CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS OR SISTER COUNCIL IN THEIR DEFENSE CAN BE DETERMINED BY A COURT TO BE INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL. INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE BEEN DEEMED BY A COURT TO BE I S. T. ON FELONY CHARGES ARE COMMITTED TO THE DEPARTMENT FOR RESTORATION OF COMPETENCY SERVICES. INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE DEEMED ICY ON MISDEMEANOR CHARGES REMAIN AT THE COUNTY LEVEL FOR THEIR SERVICES. OVER THE LAST DECADE THE DEPARTMENT HAS EXPERIENCED INCREASING REFERRALS FROM THE COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT. OF INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE DEEMED IS CHAMP BONNIE CHARGES THE CURRENT AND PRIOR YEAR BUDGET ACTS HAVE MADE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS INCREASING PROGRAMS AND SERVICES FOR AYE ISSUES INCLUDING ACTIVATING ADDITIONAL STATE HOSPITAL BEDS.

DESPITE TO INCREASE TREATMENT CAPACITY AND LEGISLATIVE AND OTHER DEPARTMENTAL EFFORTS TO INCREASE EFFICIENCIES TOWARD REDUCING THE LENGTH OF STAY FOR I ISSUES. INCREASING NUMBER OF COURT REFERRALS HAS RESULTED IN THE CONTINUED WAITLISTS FOR IDEAS TO USE MEANING PSH SERVICES. ADDITIONALLY THE IMPACTS OF THE KOBE INETEEN PANDEMIC AND NECESSARY INFECTION CONTROL MEASURES THAT WE HAVE HAD TO IMPLEMENT AT THE STATE HOSPITAL. HAS RESULTED IN LOWER ADMISSIONS REDUCE CAPACITY FOR THE TREATMENT OF FELONY ISPS IDEAS STAGE. FURTHER INCREASING THE WAY OF US TODAY THERE ARE OVER NINETEEN HUNDRED INDIVIDUALS AWAITING ADMISSION INTO AN I. S. T. TREATMENT PROGRAM. WHILE THE DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN WORKING AGGRESSIVELY OVER THE YEARS TO ADDRESS THE GROWING WAITLIST IN TWENTY FIFTEEN THE AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION DENSITY THE DEPARTMENT IT'S ON A CASE ARE RIGHT NOW ANNOUNCED YOU HAVE ANY- BE CLINTON.

THE SERVICES ARE DESIGN TO PROVIDE EARLY ACCESS TO TREATMENT TIES T. INDIVIDUALS ON THE PSH WAITLIST WHILE WE WORK TO COORDINATE PLACEMENT IN THE LEAST RESTRICTIVE SETTING. THAT MAY BE AVAILABLE WITHIN THE HIGHEST TO CONTINUE ON THE GOAL REALLY IS TO FACILITATE THE STABILIZATION BY ASKING PATIENTS TO PROMOTE INCREASED ELIGIBILITY AND PLACEMENT IN DIVERSION OR OTHER COMMUNITY BASED TREATMENT PROGRAMS. THIS PROGRAM COME WILL ACT TO TREATMENT AT THE EARLIEST POINT POSSIBLE UPON I AS CHIEF AMENDMENT AFTER INDIVIDUALS ARE ARRESTED AND BOOKED INTO JAIL. D. S. H.

CONTINUUM OF CARE TO BETTER FACILITATE EDUCATION ADMISSIONS AND TRANSFERS. CONDITIONALLY RESOURCES ARE INCLUDED AS SYSTEM CAPTURING AND MAINTAINING HIGH QUALITY DATA- AND MEETING DATA REPORTING REQUIREMENTS UNDER STATE ATTY. THE NEXT THREE COMPONENTS I SUPPORT THE SIGNIFICANT EXPANSION OF COMMUNITY PLACEMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE FELONY ISP POPULATION AND THIS IS ACHIEVED THROUGH THE EXPANSION OF COMMUNITY BASED RESTORATION CONVERSION PROGRAMS. THE TRAGEDY IS BELOW FOCUS ON BOTH SHORT TERM AND LONG TERM SOLUTIONS. THE FIRST COMPONENT IS A SHORT TERM SOLUTION TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF FELONY I S. T. INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE CURRENTLY ON THE TSCH WAITLISTS. SERVED IN I COUNTY DIVERSION PROGRAMS ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT BARRIERS TO PLACING MORE I. S. T. INDIVIDUALS AND A DIVERSION PROGRAM IS THE COST AND AVAILABILITY OF HOUSING THE COST AND AVAILABILITY OF HOUSING. YES H. PROPOSES TO PROVIDE ONE TIME ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO COUNTIES FOR HOUSING TO HELP ADDRESS THIS RESOURCE GAP. COUNTIES CAN UTILIZE FUNDING TO PROVIDE HOUSING TO DIVERSION CLIENTS IN THE MOST APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF CARE INCLUDING- BUT NOT LIMITED TO SHORT TERM TREATMENT FACILITIES SUCH AS DIABETES OR MENTAL HEALTH REHAB CENTERS. RESIDENTIAL HOUSING WAS CLINICALLY ENHANCED SERVICES BORN HERE'S- OR OTHER APPROPRIATE RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES. THE NEXT COMPONENT IS A SIGNIFICANT INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT TO DEVELOP OVER A THREE YEAR PERIODTHE DEDICATED HOUSING THAT'S NEEDED TO SUPPORT THE HIGHEST YOU POPULATION SERVED IN THE COMMUNITY BASED RESTORATION OR DIVERSION PROGRAMS DISEASE PROPOSES TO PARTNER WITH COUNTIES AND OR HOUSING DEVELOPMENT ORGANIZATIONS TO FUND THE DEVELOPMENT OF APPROXIMATELY FIVE THOUSAND COMMUNITY BANDS. ASSUMING AN AVERAGE LENGTH OF STAY OF ABOUT EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY MONTHS YES AGE ESTIMATES THAT THESE BEDS WITH THE SERVER PROXIMALLY THREE THOUSAND NEW ISP INDIVIDUALS REFERRED TO THE COMMUNITY PROGRAMS ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. ISRAEL FOR WOULD PROVIDES UP FINE TO COVER THE DOWN PAYMENT OF A RESIDENTIAL UNIT. RETROFITTING AND FURNISHINGS FOR CLIENTS AND STAFF. THE ONGOING COST OF OPERATING THE HOMES WOULD THEN BE PROVIDED THROUGH THE PER PATIENT RATE- THAT WOULD THAT WE'RE PROPOSING BE PAID TO THE SERVICE PROVIDERS WHO WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR COORDINATING THE CLIENT'S PLACEMENT IN HOUSING AS WELL AS PROVIDING THOSE WRAPAROUND TREATMENT SERVICES. AS A COMPLIMENT TO THIS INVESTMENT IN THE DEDICATED HOUSING DS EACH PROPOSES DEPARTMENT PARTNER WITH COUNTIES TO CREATE OR EXPAND PERMANENT COMMUNITY BASED TREATMENT PROGRAMS. FOR FELONY ISG INDIVIDUALS THE RESOURCES HE REQUESTED HERE WILL PROVIDE A ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR PER CLIENT RATE. SUPPORTING EIGHTEEN MONTHS AVERAGE LENGTH OF STAY IN EITHER EASTSIDE COMMUNITY BASED RESTORATION OR DIVERSION PROGRAM. SERVICES ARE ENVISIONED AS AN INTENSIVE COMMUNITY TREATMENT MODEL OF CARE WITH INCREASED CLINICAL ENGAGEMENT IN PSYCHIATRY SERVICES AS WELL AS OTHER WRAPAROUND SERVICES. AND ONGOING HOUSING SUPPORTS. GINNELLY THE PERKS PATIENT RATE USED FRIENDS CARE SUCH. AND ENHANCE SUPERMAN THROUGH PARTNERSHIP WITH PROBATE.

AS WELL AS PROVIDING TRAINING AND TECHNICAL RESOURCE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE RESOURCES TO HELP ON PROVIDE SUPPORT WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT FOR SERVICE PROVIDERS- AS WELL AS TRACKING OUTCOMES DATA AND CONDUCTING AN EVALUATION OF THE PROGRAM. ON THE NEXT COMPONENT OF THE ICE YOU SOLUTIONS PROPOSAL PROPOSES TO PILOT A NEW INDEPENDENT PLACEMENT DETERMINATION PANEL TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF STATE HOSPITAL PATIENTS SERVED IN THE COMMUNITY B.R. CONDITIONAL RELEASE PROGRAM. THIS NEW PANEL WERE WILL REVISE THE COMMUNITY PROGRAM DIRECTOR ROLE THAT IS PART OF THE CONRAD. AND IMPROVE THE ASSESSMENT PROCESS FOR PATIENTS FOR EITHER NOT GUILTY BY REASON OF INSANITY OR FAST. AND ALEXANDER WITH MENTAL HEALTH DISORDER WHO CURRENTLY RESIDE IN OUR STATE HOSPITALS THE OVERALL INCREASE UTILIZATION CONRAD WELL THREE BEDS IN THE STATE HOSPITALS ALLOW PLACEMENT OF INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE TRULY IN NEED OF. THE HIGHEST LEVELS OUR SYSTEM. AND LASTLY AS THE DIRECTOR MANAGED. I CAN SURE THAT EXPAND OF THE S. C. FUNDED BASED CARE TO NOT CREATE AN- INCENTIVES THAT MAY DRIVE ADDITIONALI ASKED YOU REFERRALS WE ARE PROPOSING TO IMPLEMENT GROWTH CAP THAT WOULD APPLY TO ALL COUNTIES. AND INCLUDE A COST SHARING METHODOLOGY OF THE GROWTH CAP IS EXCEEDED. YES AGE PROPOSES TO SET EACH COUNTIES REFERRAL. NOW OF FELLOW AS CAN. TO THAT IN THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. AND IF COUNTY SPEAKS EITHER ANNUAL BASELINE NUMBER OF REFERRALS BEGINNING- AND FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE THEY WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR PORTION OF TREATMENT COSTS. BASED ON THE NUMBER OF I. S. G. REFERRALS. ABOVE THEIR BASELINE. THERE IS TRADE BILL LANG AT THIS PROPOSAL AND I DID D. WILL BE. MADE AVAILABLE WHEN THE TV EXTREMELY. I'M. THERE WERE ALSO SEVERAL QUESTIONS THAT WERE IDENTIFIED IN THE AGENDA- AS PART OF OUR PRESENTATION WE ANSWERED QUESTIONS ONE THREE AND FOUR. DURING THAT PRESENTATION SO WILL. GO AHEAD AND FOCUS ON THE QUESTIONS THAT WERE NOT. ANSWERED WITH REGARD TO QUESTION NUMBER QUEUE THIS IS AN UPDATE ON OUR I AND D. SEVEN Q. THAT CAN PASS THE PROGRAM. SHE JUST BY WAY BACK. IN THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET ACT WE RECEIVED A TWO HUNDRED SIXTY ONE TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY SEVEN POINT ONE MILLION IN TWENTY TWO POSITIONS. ON THIS THE SCHOOL YEAR AS WELL AS EIGHTY EIGHT POINT FIVE MILLION IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE HUNDRED AND FORTY SIX MILLION. ON GOING TO ADDRESS THE SIGNIFICANT ESTEEM WAIT RESPECT. WITH PRIVATE PROVIDERS WORK COUNTIES TO DEVELOP NEW OR RENOVATED EXISTING FACILITIES TO PROVIDE ALTERNATIVE TREATMENT OPTIONS TO STATE HOSPITALS. OF THE TOTAL RECEIVED WE DIDN'T RECEIVE A TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION IN ONE TIME FUNDING. TO SUPPORT INFRASTRUCTURE COSTS FOR THESE FACILITIES. SO WE REALLY CONSIDER THAT THIS PROGRAM IS A CRITICAL COMPONENT. TO THE CONTINUUM OF CARE REQUIRED TO SUPPORT COMMUNITY TREATMENT AND PLACEMENT OF ICED TEA INDIVIDUALS IN THE LEAST RESTRICTIVE SETTING POSSIBLE. TO THAT END WE WANT TO BE THOUGHTFUL. AS TO WHERE THIS INVESTMENT IS TARGETED SO WE HAVE A BROAD COVERAGE OF I AM DEEP BEDS ACROSS THE STATE THE SERVICE POPULATION. AS AS FAR AS UPDATE DID BEGAN- OVER THE SUMMER ENGAGEMENT MEETINGS WITH MULTIPLE PROVIDERS- WOULD NOT WITH OVER TEN DIFFERENT PROVIDERS- SINCE LAST SUMMER AND THIS IS REALLY TO HELP US TO IDENTIFY WHAT THE INVENTORY OF. POTENTIAL PROJECTS- ARE. IDENTIFIED SEVERAL. BOB PROVIDER PROJECTS TO DATE AND- HAVE CONTINUED OUR WORK WITH THESE PROVIDERS SHE REALLY FLESH OUT PROGRAM DEVELOPMENTS- AND THROUGH BUT HOWEVER THROUGH THESE DISCUSSIONS WITH OUR PROVIDERS WE HAVE IDENTIFIED THE NEED TO SUPPORT- BEYOND JUST I AM D. AND Q. LEVEL OF CARE- AS A COMPLIMENT TO THE I AM D. TO PROMOTE THAT STABILIZATION THAT WE TALKED ABOUT FOR PORTION OF THE FELONY I S. T. POPULATION WHO MAY REQUIRE INVOLUNTARY MEDICATIONS. AND SO MOST RECENTLY AND NOT REALLY IT. A REFLECTED IN OUR ESTIMATE WE ARE FINALIZING CONTRACT NEGOTIATIONS WITH AND HUGE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH HOSPITAL PROVIDER TO ACTIVATE UP TO A HUNDRED AND SEVENTEEN BEDS A SOLID HIT BY PSYCHIATRIC STABILIZATION AND SUPPORT A PATHWAY FOR I. S. T. INDIVIDUALS TO PARTICIPATE IN DIVERSION OR OTHER OUTPATIENT TREATMENT PROGRAMS. ONE I CAN CLOSE MY UPDATE ALTERNATE OVER TO DIRECTOR CLINTON TO PROVIDE RESPONSES JUNE QUESTIONS FIVE AND SIX THANK YOU VERY MUCH. BOOK YOUR MUTE DIRECTOR. YOU'D THINK BY NOW AMAZEMENT MONTHS UNTIL WORLD IN A GROUNDHOG DAY. MY APOLOGIES- SO WITH RESPECT TO QUESTION NUMBER FIVE- THE END WHICH IS AROUND TO IN ADDITIONAL- RECOMMENDATION RECOMMENDATIONS BACK FROM THE IC SOLUTIONS WORK GROUP THAT WE MIGHT BE CONSIDERING FOR FUTURE ACTION THE PROPOSAL ACTUALLY WOULD IMPLEMENT MANY COMPONENTS OF THE I. S. G. SOLUTIONS WORKGROUP RECOMMENDATIONS AND LAST FALL WE IMPLEMENTED ONE OF THE RECOMMENDED SOLUTIONS AROUND DIVERSION. THERE WERE SEVERAL RECOMMENDATIONS THAT CENTERED ON TRAINING AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND DEVELOPMENT OF BEST PRACTICE GUIDES AND THE DEPARTMENT HAS PREVIOUSLY AND CONTINUES TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO OUR COUNTY IN CRIMINAL JUSTICE PARTNERS REGARDING BEST PRACTICES AND IS WORKING TO DEVELOP SOME BEST PRACTICE GUIDES AND TOTAL SIXTEEN OF THE FORTY ONE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE UNDER IMPLEMENTATION OR PROPOSED FOR IMPLEMENTATION. IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE REPORT OF SOLUTIONS WHAT THE CENSUS OF ACTIONABLE SOLUTIONS THAT WERE IDENTIFIED BY WORK REMEMBERS AND THROUGH THE PUBLIC PARTICIPATION THEY DIDN'T NECESSARILY REPRESENT CONSENSUS OF THE WORKGROUP MEMBERS AND SOME WORK REMEMBERS MIGHT HAVE EITHER SUPPORTED OR OPPOSED SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS AND ALL OF THE FEEDBACK THAT WE DID RECEIVE- AROUND SUPPORT IN OPPOSITION IS AVAILABLE ON THE I. S. T. SOLUTIONS WORK GROUP WEBSITE. IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO SHARE THAT SOME OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS WERE ITEMS THAT WOULD BE OUTSIDE OF THE DEPARTMENT RUBIO TO IMPLEMENT AND WILL TAKE FURTHER EXPLORATION AND DISCUSSION WITH OTHER STATE- PARTNERS OR OTHER- PARTNERS OUTSIDE OF THIS AND STATE DEPARTMENTS ON POTENTIAL IMPLEMENTATION SO ULTIMATELY THE SOLUTIONS THAT WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED AND THOSE PROPOSED TO BE IMPLEMENTED REPRESENTS LESIONS THAT WOULD HAVE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR ABILITY TO MEET THE COURT ORDERED TIME LINES. AND WILL HAVE SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE. IMPACTS FOR THOSE WE SERVE. AND THEN WITH RESPECT TO. NUMBER SIX WHICH IS. PERFORMING IN A- TO ON PREVIOUSLY THE GOAL OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO DO TWO THINGS TO ME WINDS ARE REQUIRED BY THE COURT AND MAKE MEANINGFUL CHANGES TOWARD SUPPORTING INDIVIDUALS. AND TO RESIDE IN THE LEAST RESTRICTIVE SETTING THAT'S APPROPRIATE. HAVING THE LIVES OF THOSE WE SERVE AND BREAKING THE CYCLE OF CRIMINALIZATION AS CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE PROPOSAL DOES INCLUDE FUNDING FOR FIVE THOUSAND BANDS WHICH REPRESENTS WHAT WE IS NEEDED TO START APPROXIMATELY THREE THOUSAND NEW AYE ISSUES ANNUALLY. WHICH REPRESENTS TREATING ABOUT 60% OF AYE ISSUES ANNUALLY IN THE COMMUNITY. ADDITIONALLY IT INVEST IN PROVIDING EARLY ACCESS TO TREATMENT AND STABILIZATION- WHICH I USE TNCS- WHICH WOULD ALLOW US TO BEGIN DELIVERING TREATMENT MORE QUICKLY. IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THERE ARE MANY FORCES A PLANE THAT CAN ALL IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO MEET TIMELINES FOR EXAMPLE INCREASING REFERRALS FROM THECOURT THIS YEAR WE ARE EXPERIENCING A 13% INCREASE OVER PRE PANDEMIC REFERRAL RATES. AND ADDITIONALLY THAT PANDEMIC IMPACTS ON OUR HOSPITALS AND THOSE WE PARTNER WITH AND SERVING ICE TEAS CAN ALSO SLOW ACCESS TO TREATMENT IMPACT EXPANSION EFFORTS. SO ULTIMATELY THIS PROPOSAL DOES MAKE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS. TOWARD MEETING THOSE TIMELINES. WE'RE HAVING TAKE ANY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- AND YOU GUYS ARE CERTAINLY BEEN BUSY THIS LAST YEAR I BY APPRECIATE ALL OF THE WORK THAT YOU'RE DOING- A LET'S GO TO THE L. A. O. FIRST TO SEE I SEE MISTER SHOULD WITH HIS HAND UP THERE HE GOES. THANK YOU THANK YOU CENTER EGGMAN HIGH COURT ISSUED A WITH THE L. A. L. I JUST SOME COMMENTS ON ON THIS ISSUE. FIRST WE WOULD JUST SHARE THAT WE DO INTEND TO PROVIDE AN ANALYSIS OF THIS ISSUE IN A FORTHCOMING POST. FOCUSED ON THE GOVERNOR'S MAJOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROPOSALS. WHICH WE EXPECT TO RELEASE IN THE IN THE COMING WEEKS- SECOND WE WOULD NOW ASK THE ADMINISTRATION JUST MENTIONED THAT- THE PLAN IS FOR THE ADMIN TO PROVIDE FORTHCOMING TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE TO IMPLEMENT. MAJOR PORTIONS OF THE IC SOLUTIONS PACKAGE- BUT THIS LANGUAGE IS NOT YET AVAILABLE FOR REVIEW. NEXT WE WOULD NOTE THAT AS AS THE ADMIN MENTION EARLIER THE ADMINISTRATION VIEWS THIS PROPOSED PACKAGE OF IC SOLUTIONS. AS A STARTING POINT FOR DISCUSSIONS ESPECIALLY WITH. STAKEHOLDER GROUPS- AND THE ADMINISTRATION INTENDS TO UPDATE THIS PROPOSED PACKAGE AT ME REVISED TO INCLUDE ANY CHANGES OR REFINEMENTS SO. THE LEGISLATURE IS GOING TO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO WEIGH IN. LATER IN THE BUDGET PROCESS AS WELL I'M ON THIS ITEM. SPEAKING TO THE CURRENT ITERATION OF THIS PACKAGE THE SPECIFIC PROPOSALS INCLUDED REFLECT A FEW OF THE IDEAS FROM THE ICY WORKGROUP BUT NOT ALL OF THEM- YOU KNOW SIMPLY I'LL JUST SAY THAT THEY INCLUDED- A FEW PRIORITIES SUCH AS- FURTHER EXPANSIONS OF THE COMMUNITY CAN YOU COMMUNITY BASED IN DIVERSION. OPTIONS EARLY STABILIZATION- IMPROVE PATIENT TRACKING SYSTEMS AND HOUSING RELATED INVESTMENTS BOTH IN THE SHORTER TERM AND IN THE LONGER TERM- THAT ARE SORT OF INTENDED TO COMPLEMENT THE FUNDING FOR ACUTE AND SUB ACUTE BEDS THAT. WAS PROVIDED TO TEACH SAY THE SHN ME ON TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO BUDGET. AS MENTIONED THE PROPOSAL DOESN'T A REFER. AND REQUIRE FOR COUNTIES TO ENSURE. FOR TREATMENT IF THEY EXCEED THAT CAP. GUARDS TO PROPOSED FUND YOU KNOW GENERAL FIND THESE REASONABLE. TO FIND THIS YEAR YOU KNOW THE EARLY STABILIZATION INVESTMENTS ESPECIALLY SEEM PROMISING GIVEN THAT WE UNDERSTAND THAT LACK OF EARLY STABILIZATION FOR INDIVIDUALS COMING INTO THE JUSTICE SYSTEM IS ONE OF THE MAJOR BARRIERS TO ENSURING THAT AN INDIVIDUAL CAN PARTICIPATE IN THE COMMUNITY OPTIONS. PROVIDED THROUGH TSA H. HOWEVER YOU KNOW WE WOULD NOTE THAT THE IC SOLUTIONS WORKGROUP INCLUDED A VARIETY OF IDEAS ALTHOUGH SOME OF THESE ARE VERY CONCEPTUAL AT THIS POINT- AS WAS ALLUDED TO IN THE AGENDA TODAY YOU KNOW THE LEGISLATURE MAY WISH TO. MONITOR PROGRESS AND DEVELOPMENT OF SOLUTIONS BASED ON THE OTHER IDEAS IN THE WORKGROUP. FOR EXAMPLE YOU KNOW WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE WORK GROUP DISCUSSED OPTIONS RELATED TO IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF IT- INITIAL COMPANY COMPETENCY EVALUATION PROCESS THESE- WHICH IN CONCEPTS SEEM SEEM PROMISING- WE WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO CONSIDER WHERE PSH CAN COORDINATE WITH OTHER STATE DEPARTMENTS- WHICH ARE MAKING. AVAILABLE RELATIVELY SIMILAR HOUSING RELATED AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH BED CAPACITY OPTIONS SUCH AS THE H. CSS BEHAVIOR HEALTH CONTINUUM INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAM. TO SEE IF THOSE PROGRAMS CAN BE LEVERAGED PRIVACY ISSUES AS WELL- WHILE THERE MAY STILL BE VALUE IN V. S. AGE SPECIFIC HOUSING AND TREATMENT PROGRAMS. TAKING A BIT TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THESE OTHER AVAILABLE OPTIONS MAY SORT OF ADD ADDITIONAL ADDITIONAL SIGNIFICANT VALUE. FINALLY WHILE WE DON'T DISAGREE IN CONCEPT WITH A REFERRAL CAP ON COUNTIES FOR ISPS YOU KNOW THESE THESE CAPS MAY ULTIMATELY INCENTIVIZE COUNTIES TO PARTNER WITH THE S. H. ON SOME OF THE SOLUTIONS THAT WERE MENTIONED TODAY. ON THE LEGISLATURE MAY WISH TO SORT OF CONSIDER WELCOME. CAPACITY COUNTIES HAD CURRENTLY TO SORT OF REMAIN UNDER THESE CAPS- AND HOW SORT OF COUNTIES CAN LEVERAGE. THE PROGRAMS AVAILABLE TO THEM IN ORDER TO INSURE THAT THEY ASKING YOU TO STAY ON THOSE CASH. ARE SUPPOSED ARE ALL L. A. O. AT THIS TIME OR WE'RE HAPPY TO TAKE A QUESTION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- DEPARTMENT FIND. I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING AT THIS TIME THAT THAT WAS GOING TO BE AROUND MY QUESTIONS TO THERE WAS A THERE'S A LOT OF TALK ABOUT AND I CLEARLY UNDERSTAND THAT HOUSING AND STEP DOWN BEDS AND ALL OF THAT ARE ARE- IMPERATIVE TO THIS. BUT HOW WE'RE HOW WE'RE GONNA MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT. FOUR NINE DOUBLE DOUBLES AND IN THE COUNTY. MONEY WITHOUT ALL OF THIS BEING. A COORDINATED AND I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO SPEAK TO THAT RIGHT NOW DIRECTOR OR- HAS THERE BEEN ANY EARLY CONCEPTUAL THOUGHTS ABOUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO MAKE SURE. WE'RE NOT JUST. CONTINUING THROWING MONEY TO THE COUNTY FROM DIFFERENT PARTS OF FOR THE SAME BED. THANK YOU. AND SO WITH RESPECT TO COORDINATION YOU KNOW WE ARE WORKING WITH CAL HHS AND OF THE OTHER DEPARTMENTS THAT HAVE RECEIVED FUNDING- TO PROVIDE FUNDING TO THE COUNTIES- SO THERE IS A LOT OF COORDINATION GOING ON ACROSS OUR DEPARTMENTS AND WHAT THE AGENCY. BUT ALSO WOULD NOTE THAT THE AND THE HI THE- THERE IS DISTINCT FOCUSES OF EACH OF THE DIFFERENT INVESTMENTS- AND SO. FOR THEM FOR THE- DOLLARS THAT WE ARE PROPOSING THIS WOULD BE DEDICATED HOUSING TO TREAT INDIVIDUALS WHILE THEY'RE IN THE I. S. T. COMMENCEMENT. TEAM FUNDING THAT IS PROPOSED UNDER HOMELESSNESS UNDER THE- BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONTINUING DOLLARS AND THE OTHER INVESTMENTS THOSE ARE LARGELY AROUND SERVING. THEIR TO ESTABLISH THE BEHAVIOR HEALTH CONTINUE THAT WILL. HOPEFULLY PREVENT INDIVIDUALS FROM BECOMING AYE ISSUE BECAUSE THERE WILL BE A BROADER CONTINUUM TO SERVE INDIVIDUALS- WHO ARE IN- WHO LIVE WITH BEHAVIORAL HALTH CONDITIONS. AND THEN WE'LL ALSO HAVE A CONTINUING TO CATCH THESE INDIVIDUALS WHO DO ALTERNATELY AND UP IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM ON THE BEAT AFTER THE END OF THEIR COMMITMENT OR AFTER THEIR I. S. T. COMMITMENT. SO ULTIMATELY THESE ARE VERY DIFFERENT POTS OF MONEY- AND THAT WE ARE ALL WORKING. TOGETHER TO TRY TO COORDINATE ENSURE THAT THE SYSTEM IS IN A WORK TOGETHER- AND THAT THESE INVESTMENTS ARE LEVERAGING ARE BEING LEVERAGED AND HIS THAT I'M- BEST BENEFIT FOR THE INDIVIDUALS. THAT ARE BEING SEARCHED. I THINK YOU CAN CAN YOU DESCRIBE AT THE AVERAGE OF PAY FOR EACH PERSON IN THE- IN THE DIVERSE PROGRAM. HELLO THIS IS CHRIS- WE HEY- OUT IT IS JUST OVER FORTY SEVEN THOUSAND AND- ANNUALLY OVER A THREE YEAR PERIOD- CLIENT. PER CLIENT PER YEAR FORTY THREE THOUSAND YEAH BUT WE ALLOCATE THAT TO COUNTIES ACTUALLY IS A FLAT RATE PAYMENT ACROSS THAT THREE YEAR PERIOD OKAY AND I WOULD JUST ALSO NOTE THAT A LOT OF THE A LOT A LOT OF THE SOLUTIONS WHICH AGAIN ON OCT THEY ALL MAKE SENSE- DEPEND A LOT. ON CONTRACTING WITH COMMUNITY ARTNERS- AND HOW MANY OF THOSE RELATIONSHIPS ARE ALREADY IN PLACE OR ARE THOSE AND AGAIN AS WE CONTINUE TO TALK ABOUT WORK FORCE OR ARE YOU GONNA BE ABLE TO FIND THOSE PARTNERS. OUT THERE. SURE UNDER THE DIVERSION PROGRAM WEEK WE DO CURRENTLY HAVE. CONTRACTS WITH TWENTY FOUR COUNTIES AND OUR- THROUGH THE EXPANSION DOLLARS THAT WE RECEIVED IN IN THIS CURRENT YEAR BUDGET- AN ADDITIONAL SIX COUNTIES ARE GOING TO BE COMING ON BOARD AND WE'VE BEEN AND- CONTINUAL CONVERSATION WITH MANY OF THESE COUNTY IS AND- IN IN TERMS OF DEVELOPING THOSE RELATIONSHIPS AND WORKING WITH THEM ON THE DIVERSION PROGRAMS BUT ALSO- IN THIS LAST YEAR. OR SO- HAVE BEEN PARTNERING WITH THEM CAN YOU TALK TALKING ABOUT THIS BROADER CONTINUE ON AND REALLY LOOKING AT ALL OF THE VARIOUS OPTIONS THAT WE HAVE WITH OUR I AND D. SEGMENT. WHEN IT'S OUR COMMUNITY BASED RESTORATION AND DIVERSION AND REALLY LOOKING AT THIS HOLISTICALLY WHAT ARE THE GAPS IN THOSE- INDIVIDUAL COMMUNITIES THAT WE NEED TO REALLY TACKLE AND HOW DO WE STRATEGICALLY SORT OF DIRECT THESE DOLLARS TO FILL THOSE GAPS- AND SO. WE CAN REALLY REACHING OUT TO THEM THE MAJORITY OF THE COUNTIES THAT WE CURRENTLY. WORK WITH. THANK YOU A I JUST THINK I IS TO BE AN ISSUE THAT WE THAT WE- AGAIN I'M GLAD HEAR YOUR CALL. WITH ALL THESE DIFFERENT POTS OF MONEY BECAUSE I DO BELIEVE PART OF THE BIG INFRASTRUCTURE MONEY WHAT WAS A DIRECTLY FOR BEDS AND I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE SAYING WOULD YOU NEED. SEPARATE IN DIFFERENT BEDS BUT LET'S JUST MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE KEEPING OUR EYES ON ALL THE DIFFERENT BUCKETS AND POTS. AND WHERE THAT MONEY'S GOING. TO DEPEND. THANK YOU AND- AND I KNOW THAT WILL PLANT MORE QUESTIONS AFTER THE PANEL BUT- SEVERAL QUESTIONS SO THEY HAVE TO FIRST OF ALL- YEAH. THE ADVANTAGE OF HAVING BEEN AROUND FOR A LITTLE WHILE IS THAT I REMEMBER BACK IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN- WHEN GOVERNOR BROWN PROPOSED- FUNDING FOR. ESTABLISHING THE- THE PROGRAM- AND- I SEE DIVERSION PROGRAM. IT WILL. SO NOW THIS MANY YEARS LATER- TO WHAT'S THE VALUATION SO I KNOW THAT BACK THEN I EVEN TRIED TO ASK THE ADMINISTRATION SO HOW MANY PEOPLE DO YOU THINK WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO DIVERT SO THAT- IN TO TRY TO REDUCE THE BURDEN ON STATE HOSPITALS AND- THEY'RE KIND OF VAGUE ABOUT THAT BUT- I GUESS AND NOW AND NOW THAT WE'RE- DONE THIS FOR MANY YEARS AND CLEARLY. ISN'T ENOUGH BUT- HOW SUCCESSFUL OR UNSUCCESSFUL WAS THAT HAS- WHAT PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE ARE NOW DIVERTED YEAH HAVE YOU SEE WE NEED TO DO MORE WE STILL HAVE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED PEOPLE- THIS THAN WHAT IN A WAITLIST SUCCESSFUL TWENTY EIGHT EFFORT. GLORIA I COULD TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT IT DID TAKE US SOME TIME TO- BRING UP THESE THESE PROGRAMS SO- I WILL SAY LIKE I MENTIONED- EARLIER IS THAT WE ARE CURRENTLY CONTRACTING WITH. WITH TWENTY FOUR COUNTIES AND SO ON THAT ORIGINAL HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS THAT WAS INCORPORATED WE HAVE- OBLIGATED NINETY THREE POINT ONE MILLION- OF THOSE OF THOSE DOLLARS AND- I OF THE TWENTY FOUR COUNTIES- THE WAY THAT WE HAD ORIGINALLY DESIGNED THIS PROGRAM. WAS NOT DIRECTLY- OR EXCLUSIVELY I SHOULD SAY. KIM DIVERT INDIVIDUALS OFF OF THE FELONY I ASKED YOU WAIT LIST FROM THE ESTATE WE ORIGINALLY DESIGNED THIS PROGRAM TO SERVE BOTH THE ASKED HE- POPULATION. ON FELONY CHARGES FOR THOSE LIKELY TO BE FOUND I ASKED SHE REPLIED BACK AND THEN WAS. CAN WE INTERRUPT THAT THE- THAT CERTAIN THE CYCLE THE PATHWAY TOWARDS THAT I AS CHIEF COMMITMENT AND THEN REALLY DIVERT THEM BEFORE THAT HAPPENS. AND SO SINCE THAT TIME- ALL ALL COUNTIES HAVE BEEN- ACTIVATED THEIR PROGRAMS. NOW THERE WERE SOME DELAYS DUE TO THE THAT THE PANDEMIC- AND SO IN TOTAL THEY ANTICIPATED DIVERTING. EIGHT HUNDRED AND TWENTY- INDIVIDUALS AND AS OF JAN THIRTY YES- FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT AT ELIGIBLE. INDIVIDUALS HAVE. THE PROBE. AND THIS. A HUNDRED AND NINETY SEVEN THOSE I TEACHERS WERE PRIOR TO REFER TO DO STAGE TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY TWO JUST LIKE WE CAN BE I T. AND FIFTY TWO OUR OKAY AND THIS IS AS OF FOR DATE IS THAT AS OF THE ACTUALLY A JUNE THIRD. WE HAVE SAID A LACK IN THE RIVER WHICH YEAR WHICH. THIS PAST YEAR TWENTY TWENTY ONE. TWENTY TWENTY ONE YEAH. OKAY SO THE GOAL WAS A HUNDRED- WE FOR. WE ACTUALLY GOT FOR TO FIFTY EIGHT. I MEAN YES WE HAD TO PAY. BUT THIS WAS BACK IN TWENTY. I REALIZED SOMETIME STAND UP. WITH A SCORE YEARS LATER SO. OKAY- ALL RIGHT- READING'S TO LEARN LESSONS THE PAST SO WE'RE NOT START FROM SCRATCH- THE OTHERS I GUESS THE OTHER I HAD IS. OF THE CURRENT BACK. THE THINK ABOUT SEVEN SOME PEOPLE ARE WHAT PER. OF THOSE ARE FALLIN. AND WHAT PERCENT OF THOSE ARE MISDEMEANOR AND THEY ALL FELONY OR DAY IS A MIX OF THE TWO. SO THE- THEY SHOULD ALL BE FELONY CHARGES- BUT BECAUSE THE WAIT LIST HAS BEEN SO LONG. YES I'M- YES I AM SORRY- SO THEY THEY SHOULD ALL BE FELONY CHARGES BIG SPOT AT NOW CURRENTLY- UNDER CURRENT LAW. WHICH WAS CHANGED LAST YEAR. I'M ALL MISDEMEANORS ARE TREATED AT THE COUNTY LEVEL OKAY ARE USED TO BE ABLE TO READ FOR INDIVIDUALS- TO THE DEPARTMENT WHO WERE MISDEMEANORS- THAT AND PAY FOR THOSE SERVICES. BUT THAT WE DID- THERE WAS. AT THE CHANGING NOT STATUTE ENACTED LAST YEAR THAT NOW REQUIRES ALL THE MISTER MINUTES REMAIN AT THE COUNTY LEVEL AND ONLY FELONIES CAN BE DIVERTED SO TO THE EXTENT THAT- THERE AREN'T ANY REMAINDER. AND MISDEMEANOR THAT MIGHT BE ON THE LIST AND FROM PRIOR TO THAT STATUTORY CHANGE BUT IT SHOULD BE IN MAJORITY OF THE VAST MAJORITY ARE AT LEAST GOING FORWARD THEY'RE GOING TO SPEAK SOMEBODY. EVEN ESTIMATES FOR ONLY A VERY SMALL FRACTION OKAY I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT THAT'S THAT SO THEN THE NEXT QUESTION I HAVE THEN. IS THAT- EIGHT THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO FIND THESE COMMITTEES NEED THAT- YOU KNOW NEED TO PUT THE MONEY FIND HOW ITSELF. AND THEN YOU JUST BE REALLY BLIND- TELLING THEIR BE SOMETHING DOWN THIS. IS BECAUSE YOU TALK ABOUT EVEN BAD IDEA. BOARD CARE ROOM. IS GOING TO HAVE SOMEONE WHO'S EIGHT- YOU KNOW I S. T. WELL THEN THAT'S OUT THERE GARCIA RIGHT. D. THINK THERE'S TO BE ISSUES RELATED TO FINDING SOME PLACES FOR THEM BECAUSE OF POTENTIAL COMMITTEE PUSH BACK. BECAUSE THESE ARE AGAINST. BIAS. YEAH I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING TO BE EASY- BUT YOU KNOW WE REALLY DO HAVE SOME VERY SUCCESSFUL MODELS WILL LOOK TO- LOS ANGELES COUNTY WE- I THINK AS YOU KNOW I MEAN THROW IN THE END INVESTMENTS IN THE CAREERS WE ARE OPERATING IN PARTNERSHIP WITH ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN. BAD COMMUNITY BASED RESTORATION FOR THAT FELONY ASKING POPULATION PREDOMINANTLY THE MAJORITY OF THOSE BAGS ARE IN RESIDENTIAL SETTINGS AND I THINK YOU KNOW THE KEY TO THEIR SUCCESS IS RALLIED HOUSING PROVIDERS THAT THEY DO WORK WITH YOU TO DO A LOT OF FUN AND WORK IN TERMS OF ENGAGEMENT WITH THE COMMUNITY AND SHARING WHAT WHAT SORT OF THE GOALS OF- AND TREATING THE POPULATION AND WHAT THEIR- STRIVING TO DO. AND SO IT IS THROUGH A LOT OF THAT THAT COULD WELL HARD WORK ON THE FRONT AND THAT THAT HELPS TO- STRESSED OUT WHICH SHOWS RELATIONSHIPS THAT'S WHAT WE GET OUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO MONITOR I DON'T MISS THIS AGREE WITH YOU I THINK- AND NO I WOULD SAY CAN YOU PLACE IT WOULD BE BETTER ANYWAY BUT- I ALSO KNOW THE REALITY OF SODA YEAH- OF THAT SOMETIMES. DO YOU YOU DO GET PUSHED BACK AND- SO IT'S NOT A SIMPLE SIMPLY- WE HAVE SOME MONEY AND WE JUST NEED TO BUY SOME RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES OR WHATEVER IT'S A AND I NEED TO YOU KNOW THAT. BUT- NO THERE'S A TO BE DIVERSE. ON FIND WHAT THE PER OF IT IS SO- IN THAT MAY MAKE A LITTLE MORE DIFFICULT. SO INTO OF TRYING TO MONITOR WHAT'S- OF. YOUR PER. WE NEED TO BE PAINT. AND THE OTHERS. I HAVE IS THAT- IN TERMS OF THE- HE SAID THERE'S A 13% INCREASING COURT REFERRALS- WHAT'S CAUSING SILVA OF COURSE THAT'S THE IMPORTANT PART RIGHT AND I GET THE IDEA OF PLAYING REFERRAL CAPS BUT IT'S NOT THE COUNTIES THAT MAKE THE DECISION UNLESS UNLESS I GOT SOMETHING WRONG THAT SOMEONE GETS AN ICY REFERRAL IT'S A JUDGE FREIGHTERS AND EVALUATION THE JUDGE SAYS OKAY. AND SO WHAT WHAT'S DRIVING THAT 13% INCREASE IS THERE SOME EDUCATION GOING ON WITH THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM IN TERMS OF THE NORTH THINK ABOUT THAT DECISION PASSED THE HOUSE ONE ENDS UP HERE AND- AND I APPRECIATE THAT THE REGIONAL PLAN WAS NOT JUST TELL PEOPLE HONESTLY BUT PEOPLE POTENTIALLY BEYOND I. ESTY BUT- SO. YEAH WELL ARE WE EVERY DAY THE ROOT CAUSES OF THE- INCREASE IN COURT REFERRALS BECAUSE THAT'S GOING TO CONTINUE PUT IN PUT PRESSURE ON THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN THE BACKLOG. AND IS EARLY ON AND ARE WE AND OTHERS PLAN TO HAVE A FIGURE OUT OF DRESS THAT. ASIDE FROM SIMPLY PUTTING A CAP ON THE COUNTY SUMMIT COUNTY UP CAP ON THERE BUT THE COUNTY IS THE ONE YOU MAKING DECISIONS. AS TO WHO'S GETTING THAT WHO'S THE REFERRALS RIGHT. SO TO GET IT GOING TO TIGHT TOUCH ON A COUPLE OF POINTS RELATED. BEING I CAN'T TAKE A BREAK WITH THAT DO I'M ABLE TO MAKES DISK. ON WHO- IS VERY COMMITTED TO THE DEPARTMENT THAT IS- THAT IS- THE CASE AND ABOUT THE- INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE I. S. T. IS REFLECTIVE. OF THE INABILITY OR THE AND NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE GOING UNTREATED. AND TARGET NOT HAVE ACCESS TO TREATMENT OR UNDER TREATED I'M IN THE COMMUNITY SO THERE IS A CORRELATION BETWEEN WHAT WE'RE SEEING IN THE COURTS AND THE SERVICES THAT ARE BEING PROVIDED IN THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONTINUUM. SO WHILE THE- COUNTIES THEMSELVES DO NOT DIRECTLY MAKE THE DECISION ON WHO IS COMMITTED TO THE DEPARTMENT THERE IS A ROLE IN DEAN- INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE AND- ENDING UP IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AND THERE IS OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE COUNTIES AND THE COURTS TO- TO COORDINATE AND COLLABORATE AROUND OPPORTUNITIES. FOR PRE TRIAL DIVERSION OKAY REVERSION FROM THE ARRESTED THERE'S LOTS OF OPPORTUNITIES TO I DON'T THINK SO AND IF I WHICH I THINK I GET WHAT YOU'RE SAYING SO THEN I GUESS THE QUESTION IS THAT- IS THAT 13% INCREASE HAPPENING BECAUSE THERE'S FEWER MENTAL HEALTH OPPORTUNITIES IN THE COUNTIES OF THEIR FOR THE JUDGES FEEL COMPELLED TO NOW REFER THEM TO. TRY S. T. OR IS AT 13% BECAUSE THEY CHANGE THEIR STANDARDS FOR WHO NEEDS I. S. T. SO WHAT'S DRIVING. THIS INCREASE IN REFERRALS. THAT'S REALLY HARD TO DO SAY I MEAN THIS IS BEEN IN ON. YOUR OVER YEAR RIGHT YEAH IT PROBLEM I WE CERTAINLY HAVE DONE OUR OWN LOOKING AT THE DATA THAT WE HAVE ON OUR SIDE TO SEE IF IT WAS LARGE ONLY- ARE DRIVEN BY A SUBSTANCE ABUSE- DIFFERENT THINGS AND POLICY ISSUES THAT WE'VE HEARD OVER THE YEARS AND QUESTIONS THAT WE'VE HEARD AND- CERTAINLY HAVEN'T. SEEN ANY MAJOR DIRECT IDENTIFICATION OF WHAT IS CAUSING- THE POPULATION pINDIVIDUALS INNING UP IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. OTHER THAN AND ULTIMATELY THERE IS- WE DEFINITELY DIDN'T LOOK AT DATA ANGLER AND- MASTER DATA TO THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES MEDICAL RECORDS AND DID SEE THAT NEARLY 50% WE'RE NOT ACCESSING THEIR SERVICES- WITHIN SIX MONTHS OF THEIR ARREST. 65% OF THE INDIVIDUALS THAT- COME INTO ISN'T AS INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL WERE HOMELESS AT THE TME OF THEIR ARREST. SO THERE CERTAINLY INDICATORS OF WHAT IS CONTRIBUTING BUT- NO DIRAC'S YOU KNOW. ANYTHING THAT DIRECTLY SAYS THAT THIS IS ME- THE FACTOR THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS OTHER THAN TO ULTIMATELY THAT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONTINUE ON. THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE HOUSING AND SUPPORTS FOR INDIVIDUALS. WHO HAVE SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS THAT'S ALL THINGS THAT WE ARE WORKING ON AS AN ADMINISTRATION CURRENTLY AND LOTS OF INVESTMENTS IN ALL OF THE AND THOSE AREAS THAT WILL HELP ULTIMATELY- HELP ADDRESS THIS AT ON GOING INCREASE AND HOPEFULLY VERY QUICKLY. ONCE INVESTMENTS ARE START TO MEET AND BE IMPLEMENTED TO HELP REDUCE THAT TREND OKAY SO I GUESS WHAT I WOULD. SAY IS THAT- LIES IT'S NOT NECESSARY TO HAND. BUT NO LESS WE INDEMNIFY. SOME OF THESE CAUSE IT'S BE AN EXTRA IN FOR. RIGHT BECAUSE YOU'RE RIGHT- THE COW YOU CAN PLAY A ROLE IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW EITHER PROVIDING OR NOT PROVIDING SERVICES WHICH THEN WOULD COMPEL A JUDGE TO FEEL LIKE WHAT I DO NEED TO REFER NOTS AYE ANDERSON OLY UNDERSTAND YOU EXPLAIN THAT DYNAMIC. AT THE SAME TIME IF WE CAN IDENTIFY WHY THE NUMBER OF CASES INCREASES THIS POINTED OUT IN THAT ANALYSIS FAILED TO THAT THE BACKLOG HAS INCREASED FROM A COUPLE HUNDRED TO NOW THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED. BUT WE UNDERSTAND WHAT'S DRIVING THAT. THE AND ALL ARE AND THEN WE'RE NOT GOING TO UNDERSTAND WHETHER INTERVENTIONS ARE WORKING OR NOT RIGHT- YOU KNOW MAYBE ON THE GROUND LEVEL WORLD BOWL. HOPEFULLY THE NUMBERS TO GO DOWN BUT THEY'RE NOT WE'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO TEASE OUT WHAT WHICH ONES ARE WORKING WHICH ONES ARE. ARE NOT AND IN FACT WE TOUCHED ON THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE THESE RECOMMENDATIONS WERE IMPLEMENTED SOME OF THEM WHEN I AND SO MANY OTHERS TO MAYBE DISAGREE ABOUT SOME. BUT IF WE'RE GONNA HAVE A DATA DRIVEN EFFORT AND WE'RE INVESTING A LOT OF MONEY IN THIS- RIGHT- I THINK FIGHT OVER FIVE HUNDRED. MILLION. CORRECT SO THAT'S- IN A IN. THE I THINK WE NEED TO ALSO FIRST. HOW DO WE PUT THINGS IN PLACE THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY FIGURE OUT LIKE OKAY WHAT'S DRIVING THIS RIGHT NOW IS BECAUSE OF THE JUDGES CONTINUE THE INCREASE THAT ARE. AFRAID OF REFERRALS FOR ICE TEA. WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO KEEP UP WITH THAT RIGHT AND SO WHY ARE THEY DOING THAT AND IF IT IS BECAUSE THE COUNTIES ARE DELIVERING ENOUGH MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IN THE COUNTY THEN. WE CAN POINT OUT THE ROOT CAUSE AND THAT'S WHERE YOU DIRECT THE MONEY IN THE EFFORTS. BUT LOOK AT IT OR IF IT'S NOT ENOUGH HOUSING RIGHT BECAUSE YOU SAID YOU'RE HOMELESS IT'S SO FORTH. SO AND I KNOW YOU'RE SORT OF. TOUCHING ON THE THESE THINGS- BUT- SO I GUESS MY- AND NOT SO MUCH A QUESTION FOR ELLIE- BUT ONE OF THINGS THAT- MORE OF A COMMENT. SO AS YOU'RE LOOKING AT THIS WHAT'S- AT LEAST FOR ME. THE HELP. IS ACTUALLY DOING A DIAGRAM OF THE SYSTEM RIGHT THIS IS THE INPUT RIGHT SO WE HAVE PEOPLE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES SOME OF THEM END UP UNFORTUNATELY IN DOWN. IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM RIGHT THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY HOPEFULLY WITH MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES THAT. SOME OF THEM WON'T MAKE IT THERE RIGHT SO THAT'S AN EXIT POINT. NOW YOUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. YOU KNOW THE COURT. YOU KNOW ANOTHER EXIT POINT YOU KNOW COMMUNITY SERVICES VERSUS THE HOSPITAL AND SO FORTH AND HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE. EXITING AND ENTERING AT THESE DIFFERENT POINTS. RIGHT AND THEN SO AT LEAST WE CAN MONITOR. THE FIGURE OUT OKAY WE'RE DOING THESE INTERVENTIONS ARE WE SEEING A CHANGE IN THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE EITHER ON RAMPING- OFF RAMPING THIS PATHWAY THAT LEADS TO. YOU KNOW ESSENTIALLY DYNASTY PROGRAM AND EITHER STATE HOSPITALIZATION OR COMMITTEE SERVICES- SO. I THINK THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL. TO AND THEN SAY OKAY AND HOW IS THAT CHANGING OVER TIME AS WE'RE IMPLEMENTING THIS AS WE'RE INVESTING OUR FIVE HUNDRED MILLION ANNUALLY. HOW IS THAT CHANGING IS A CHANGING AT ALL IS IT HOW THE CHANGING AND- AND TRYING TO SEE WERE CONCERNED THAT IF I SOME OF THE RECENT ROOT CAUSES BECAUSE IT SAID WE- YOU KNOW WE INVESTED. PROBABLY NOT ENOUGH BACK IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN. LOOKS LIKE IT MADE LITTLE DENT HERE. BUT IF WE CAN'T QUANTIFY SOME OF THESE THINGS WERE NOT GOING TO KNOW FOR YEARS I MEAN I WILL BE IN OFFICE BUT- MAY CENTER EGGMAN. AND SHE'S KIND OF THE SEATS OPENED UP HER TIME HERE- WITH THAT WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT. WILL ACTUALLY. WE SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF HAVEN'T SAW. AT LEAST WE IDENTIFIED. HOW TO SOLVE THE- BY THE END. AND I SERVE. LIKE YOU KNOW THAT THAT'S A TO BE NO FOR. COMPONENT SO WE KNOW WELL WHAT'S MAKING DIFFERENCE. AND THEN FINALLY I GUESS I WOULD JUST ALSO SAY AS I APPRECIATE THAT. SOME OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF COURSE DON'T DIRECTLY INVOLVE THIS DEPARTMENT BUT I THINK OF THE HELPFUL. OTHERS FINANCES JOBBER ARTSY HOUSE WILL HELP US WITH THIS. AND IF I WHICH OTHER AGENCIES ARE THE ONES BECAUSE THOSE WERE OVERSEEING THE OTHER. AGENCIES AND HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES WE WANT TO BE SURE LOOKING BACK TO THEM AND SAYING HEY BY THE WAY. WE HAVE AN ICY PROBLEM- THERE SOME RECOMMENDATIONS ARE YOU GOING TO BE D. TAKING YOUR OF THIS PART OF THE PROBLEM BECAUSE THAT STEP INTO PER YOUR AGENCY- SO. WITH THAT I AGAIN APPRECIATE THE- THE CONVERSATION LOOKING FOR TO THE PANEL THANK YOU. THANK YOU. MUCH- AT AND I THINK THE POINT DR PANDA'S MAKING OKAY AS IN THE YOU ARE THE MOST EXPENSIVE STOP- ON ON THE ON THE PATH OF CARE. AND I WOULD GUESS ONE OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS TO LIMIT THE AMOUNT UP COUNTY CAN REFER. IS THAT IT WOULD ENCOURAGE THEM PEARL TO PROVIDE MORE RELENTLESS ENGAGEMENT THAT'S ONE THAT I MEAN TWENTY HUGE ISSUES A LOT OF THESE FOLKS ARE VERY HARD TO ENGAGE. AND IT TAKES RELENTLESS ENGAGEMENT WHICH TO HOPEFULLY WE ARE. WE ARE. PUTTING A LOT OF MONEYINTO THE PIPELINE TO KEEP FOLKS FROM GETTING TO YOUR POINT. BUT I GUESS I WOULD I WOULD ASK- ED. MISTER SHEET WHEN YOU DO DO THIS ANALYSIS IF WE IF THE UPSTREAM AND DOWNSTREAM THAT DOCTOR PAN IS TALKING ABOUT I DON'T KNOW PERHAPS H. CHI WOULD BE THE AGENCY RESPONSIBLE FOR LOOKING AT SOME OF THAT DATA. VERSUS PUTTING IT YOU KNOW ALL IN THE STATE HOSPITAL WHEN THEY ARE THERE THE BLAST OBVERSES THE END POINT I THINK IT WOULD TAKE NEED MORE. MORE PEOPLE IDENTIFYING ON THE ENDPOINT HOW DO WE PREVENT PEOPLE FROM GETTING TO THE STATE HOSPITALS. AND I DON'T KNOW. AND I'M JUST THINKING MAYBE IT CUT AS THEIR NEW. ROLE WILL HAVE ACCESS TO THE DATA FROM ALL OVER DH YES I'M- SO. ANYWAY JUST. I THINK IT DEPENDS VERY ACCURATE THAT WE NEED TO IDENTIFY. HOW IT'S ACTUALLY WORKING AND SINCE IT'S SUCH A BIG COMPLEX SYSTEM. IT IS VERY DIFFICULT FOR ONE COMPONENT OF THAT SYSTEM. TO DO THE EVALUATION OF ALL OF IT SO- SO I GUESS WITH THAT THEN. WE WILL GET TO OUR PANEL AND- JUST FOR THE PUBLIC OUR PANEL WAS COMPRISED. AND THE STAFF WERE ASKED. EACH PERSON TO GO TO ANSWER A SERIES OF QUESTIONS AS WE DO FOR ALL OF OUR FOLKS TO HELP GUIDE OUR CONVERSATIONS. SO FAR THE PANEL AGAIN ARE GOING TO DISCUSS THE ADMINISTRATION'S I. S. T. SOLUTIONS. THAT WE HAVE WITH US- DR VERONICA KELLY CHIEF OF MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND RECOVERY SERVICES. ORANGE COUNTY HEALTH CARE AGENCY. WE HAVE KIM PETERSON SENIOR ATTORNEY IN THE MENTAL HEALTH PRACTICE FOR THE DISABILITY RIGHTS GROUP OF CALIFORNIA. WE HAVE STEPHANIE REGULAR. SYSTEM PUBLIC DEFENDER FOR THE CONTRA COSTA COUNTY. WE HAVE BRANDED. GREALISH EXECUTIVE OFFICER FOR THE COUNSELING. CRIMINAL JUSTICE AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. WE HAVE MICHELLE. FRAZIER OF FOR THE AMERICAN OF ACLU OF NORTHERN. AND WE HAVE SANDRA. C. STEVEN BERG WHO WAS A FAMILY MEMBER OF A PERSON WITH I. S. T. O. N. N. I. S. T. PATIENT. OKAY SO WE'LL ASK OUR PANELISTS TO PRESENT THEIR PERSPECTIVES FOR THE THREE MINUTES FOLLOWED BY QUESTIONS FROM THE SUBCOMMITTEE WHEN YOU'RE ALL DONE- DONE. AND WE'LL BEGIN WITH DR KELLY. THANK YOU SO MUCH SENATOR AND MANAGING CENTER PAMPER THE OPPORTUNITY AND DOCTOR BROWN CAL AND BE A HOPE DIRECTORS JUST STATED FOR ORANGE COUNTY AND PAST PRESIDENT OF THE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION. TESTIFYING ON BEHALF OF CAN BE A HEALTH DIRECTORS WE APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO HELP INFORM THE I. S. T. PROPOSAL BEFORE US TODAY DOWN THE PROCESS TO BE VERY COLLABORATIVE IN NATURE. WE APPRECIATE THE STATE'S PROPOSAL HERE AND ELSEWHERE IN THE BUDGET TO PRIORITIZE ACCESS TO HOUSING HOUSING INDIVIDUALS THERE'S MENTAL ILLNESS AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER NAMES ARE ALREADY CHALLENGING. DUE TO FEDERAL RULES THAT DISADVANTAGE OUR CLIENTS FROM HOUSING FOR EXAMPLE AND INDIVIDUALS COMING OUT OF INCARCERATION OR TREATMENT FACILITY THEY NEED TO WAIT LONGER TO ACCESS HOUSING RESOURCES. EVEN IF THEY WERE HOMELESS PRIOR TO THOSE DAYS AND IT CAN BE DIFFICULT TO HOUSE INDIVIDUALS WITH ANY SORT OF CRIMINAL BACKGROUND USED UNDERCOUNTS POINT. ON TOP OF THEIR BEHAVIOR HEALTH CONDITION- WE NOTE THAT 66% OF INDIVIDUALS WERE CHARGED WITH FELONIES ARE FOUND TO BE INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL WERE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS AT THE TIME OF THEIR ARREST. AND WE BELIEVE THAT HOMELESSNESS IS A SIGNIFICANT RISK FACTOR THAT IS DRIVING INCARCERATIONS AND THE RISK OF RECIDIVISM AND BELIEVE THAT ALL STATE HOUSING EFFORTS SHOULD SEEK. TO PRIORITIZE. AND INTO EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. WHO HAVE A ZERO MENTAL AND THE OUT OF WITH THIS USED. AS A URGE STATE YOUR- ORANGE COUNTY ARE. RELEASE FROM CONRAD THIS WORKING DO. WITH DISH AND WE- IT VERY MUCH TO ESTABLISH ALL. LEVELS OF CARE WITH THE COMMUNITY WE APPRECIATE THAT THE STATE IS EXPANDING ITS LEVEL OF CARE CAPACITY AND BELIEVED THIS DOESN'T. REFLECT ABOUT THE UNDERSTANDING THAT THE EXISTING LAKE FOREST. NEEDS CANNOT BE MATCHED. EITHER THROUGH THE EXISTING DISH OR THE EXISTING LOCAL CAPACITY THE REALITY IS THAT WE NEED TO EXPAND CAPACITY FOR THIS POPULATION. WE NEED MORE. CAN BE EVER HELD AGENCIES ARE BUILDING OUT THAT CAPACITY AS WE SPEAK FOR COMMUNITY BASED RESTORATION. FOR INDIVIDUALS CHARGED WITH FELONIES AND ONE COUNT TO BE I. S. T. THIS PROPOSAL WILL CONTINUE THAT INVESTMENT. AS WE SHARED WITH DISH THE BUILD OUT OF THIS CAPACITY AT THE LOCAL LEVEL WILL TAKESOME TIME AND A SHIFT IN POLICIES CULTURE AND PRACTICE. PUTTING GREATER RISK TOLERANCE BY LOCAL COMMUNITIES TO ENSURE THAT COURTS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT STAKEHOLDERS ARE PARDONING PARTNERING WITH US. AND THE STATE JUST LIKE WE ALL DID IN CRAFTING THIS IMPORTANT PROPOSAL TO MAKE LEVEL OF CARE DECISIONS REGARDING WHO IS BEST SERVED IN COMMUNITY. IS BEST SERVED IN CUSTODY OR AT THE STATE LEVEL AND THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE COUNTY PROVIDES BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CARE TO MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES. LAW ENFORCEMENT ARRESTS D. A. PROSECUTE PUBLIC DEFENDER DEFENSE AND THE COURT SENTENCED AS- WE ALL HAVE A ROLE. IN THESE PROPOSED SOLUTIONS. CBS DID A VERY. FOR THE FOCUS OF BEACHES ONYX. THE CURRENT INDUSTRY AND- ON HIS DOOR GAS. IN THE BEHAVIORAL AND TERM CARE THE BEACH DOLLAR AND THE C. DAHLE WILL BE AN AMAZING STAR. AND WE AGREED THAT ALL EFFORTS BY THE STATE NEED TO ADDRESS EQUITY AND LEVERAGE ON GOING MEDICAL INVESTMENTS IN ADDITION WE HAVE PROPOSED IDEAS FOR IMPROVING THE PREVENTION AND TREATMENT. OF ISPS INCLUDING ESTABLISHING STATEWIDE STANDARDS FOR ALIENIST. AND DEVELOPING A STATE CERTIFICATION STANDARD IMPROVING DISTANCE CHARGING PRACTICES TO IMPROVE CONNECTION TO LOCAL COUNTY ENTITIES. OR INDIVIDUALS LEADING STATE HOSPITAL TO REDUCE THE RISK OF RECIDIVISM AND IMPROVING IMMEDIATE ACCESS TO COMPREHENSIVE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES INCLUDING LONG ACTING INJECTABLES AND MEDICATED ASSISTED TREATMENT IN CUSTODY. TEMPERATURES THE LIKELIHOOD OF STABILITY ONCE A PERSON WALKS OUT THE DOOR. COUNTIES ARE INDUSTRIOUS WE MAKE DO WITH WHAT WE HAVE AND WE LEVERAGE WE HAVE FOCUSED ON INTERCEPT MODELS SUCH AS OUR DATA DRIVEN RECOVERY PROJECT MADE ABOUT COUNTIES INCLUDING SACRAMENTO SAMPOERNA DINO YELLOW NO DATA LIMITS. RENDON MERCED THESE THIS PROJECT INCLUDES ONLINE. PARTNERS WILL LAB WE LEVERAGE THE DATA WE HAVE FROM CUSTODY FROM PROBATION FROM HOMELESSNESS AND BEHAVIOR HOW. TO ENSURE WE CAN WORK ACROSS LARGE AND AGENCIES. TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF OUR SHARED CLIENTS ENFORCEMENT PARTNERS ADDRESS TO HER WITH OUT INTO FIVE. WE'VE BEEN UP TO TREAT PROGRAM PARTNER WITH OUR DE ATTORNEYS ARE THE- OUR TRY AGAIN IF I THOSE PEOPLE UNTREATED MENTAL ILLNESS AND TO AND PROVIDE TREATMENT. SO THEY DON'T DOT AS AN I. S. T. SACRAMENTO COUNTY HAS DONE A IN JAIL TO EVERY CENTER PRE TRIAL DIVERSION. COLLABO WITH PROBATION PUBLIC TO. ALONG WITH A CHRONIC NOOSE OFFEND PROGRAM NEVADA COUNTY LEVERAGES THEIR CHAPLAIN GRANT AND GOT FORTY PROGRAMMING EACH USE CASE MANAGERS IN THE PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICE TO ENSURE TREATMENT AND HOUSING AS PART OF THEIR DIVERSION. VENTURA COUNTY HAS COMMUNITY SERVICES COORDINATORS THAT WORK AND DEPLOYED WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT SH CHIU AS SENATOR EGGMAN TALKED ABOUT TO BUILD TRUST AND ENGAGE HIGH RSK PEOPLE AND COMMUNITY. AND SEPARATE IN A COUNTY THEY FOUND THAT IT TAKES FORTY FOUR ZERO VISITS TO ESTABLISH A TRUST WITH SOMEONE WHO WAS ON HOUSING AND GET THEM TO ACTIVATE TO TREATMENT BUT ONCE THOSE FORTY VISITS ARE MADE. 92% SUCCESS SUCCESS RATE AN ACTIVATION. VOLUNTARILY ENTER TREATMENT. HM MEMBERS. THE NUMEROUS YOU NEED TO THAT COME WITH. COMMUNITY BASED TREATMENT FOR AND WITH SERIOUS MY ILLNESS SUBSTANCE USE NAMES. AND WE HELPED IMPLEMENT. AS WE HELPED IMPLEMENT STATE'S. WE MUST BE CLEAR THAT IT WILL TAKE TIME RESOURCE INVESTMENT AND COLLABORATION THE MOST IMPORTANT ACROSS MULTIPLE STATE AND LOCAL PARTNERS I THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE OUR- PERSPECTIVE AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I KNOW OIL THE OTHER BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PEOPLE WANTED YOU TO SPEAK. THANK YOU VERY MUCH LET'S GO NOW TO- KIM PETERSON A SENIOR ATTORNEY WITH THE DISABILITY RIGHTS- MY NAME IS COMPUTER ST AND I AM A SENIOR ATTORNEY WITH DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA- THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE ON THIS PANEL. WE ARE KNOWLEDGES THAT DSHS I ASKED SOLUTIONS. REFLECTS STAKEHOLDER INPUT THAT URGED IMPLEMENTATION OF COMMUNITY BASED SOLUTIONS THE ISP WEIGHTLESS CRISIS. FIFTY S. H. ABLE TO CARE OUT THE MASSIVE EXPAND OF FELONY I ASKED YOU TO VERSION AND COMMUNITY BASED RESTORATION THAT IT PROPOSED IT IS. THESE EFFORTS WILL HOPEFULLY LAY THE GROUNDWORK FOR GREATER REFORMS THAT WILL POSITIVELY IMPACT THE. JUSTICE INVOLVED ARE AT RISK. DSHS IDENTIFIED THAT A CYCLE OF HOMELESSNESS DISENGAGEMENT FROM BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES AND INVOLVEMENT IN THE CRIMINAL LEGAL SYSTEM IS A LEADING DRIVER OF INCREASING FELONY I ISSUE REFERRALS AS SUCH D. R. C. AND OTHERS ON THIS PANEL INCLUDING THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION AND THE ACLU. I REQUEST THAT THE LEGISLATURE CONTINUE TO ALLOW DSHS DIVERSION PROGRAM TO SERVE PEOPLE AT RISK OF BEING FOUND INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL ON FELONY CHARGES. WHAT MEETING DSA STARBURST AND ONLY TWO PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY BEEN DOWN INCOMPETENT AS A MISSED OPPORTUNITY FOR THE STATE TO BREAK THE CYCLE FOR PEOPLE WHO MAY EVENTUALLY BE FOUND I. ESTY AND FIND THEMSELVES ON A WAIT LIST. TURNING TO THE SECOND QUESTION POSED TO THE R. C. ABOUT OTHER SUGGESTED REFORMS TO ENSURE APPROPRIATE. TREATMENT OPTIONS FOR JUSTICE INVOLVED PEOPLE WITH SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS. WE AND- JUST STATE DOCKS POLICIES THAT ENCOURAGE EXPANSION OF EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICES THAT ARE PROVEN TO DISRUPT THE CYCLE OF HOMELESSNESS DISENGAGEMENT FROM TREATMENT. AND INVOLVEMENT IN THE CRIMINAL LEGAL SYSTEM. TO THIS POINT DSHS RESEARCH SHOWS A LEADING FACTOR IN THE NATION WIDE INCREASE IN HIGHEST YOU REFERRALS IT'S AN ADEQUATE GENERAL MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IN THE COMMUNITY INCLUDING ASSERTIVE COMMUNITY TREATMENT OTHERWISE KNOWN AS ACT. THE R. C. WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE STATE TAKES STEPS TO EXPAND THE AREA THE AVAILABILITY OF ACT WHICH IS AN EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICE THAT OFFERS A WIDE RANGE OF COMMUNITY BASED MEDICAL AND SOCIAL SERVICES TO PEOPLE LIVING WITH SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS. IF DELIVERED WITH FIDELITY TO THE MODEL ACT IMPROVES OUTCOMES FOR PEOPLE WITH SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS YOU ARE MOST AT RISK OF HOMELESSNESS PSYCHIATRIC CRISIS IN HOSPITALIZATION AND INVOLVEMENT IN THE CRIMINAL LEGAL SYSTEM. THERE IS ALSO A FORENSIC MODEL OF ACT SPECIFICALLY TAILORED TO THE NEEDS OF JUSTICE INVOLVED PEOPLE ASSESSMENT PUBLISHED LAST MONTH BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. INDICATES THAT A. C. T. THAT IS PROVIDED WITH FINALITY TO EVIDENCED BASED MODEL IS NOT WIDELY AVAILABLE IN CALIFORNIA. TWO IDEAS COME TO MIND FOR EXPANDING THE AVAILABILITY OF A CTR STATE. FIRST THE STATE COULD ALIGN THE REGULATIONS GOVERNING FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIPS ARE FSP IS WHAT THE EVIDENCE BASED MODEL FOR A. C. T. THOUGH THE ADDRESS P. IS DESIGNED TO BE A WHATEVER IT TAKES APPROACH IT DOES NOT HAVE TO ADHERE STEP PROVEN MODEL OF ACT. IN ADDITION THERE IS GREAT VARIABILITY ACROSS THE STATE AND HOW COUNTIES OPERATOR AT THIS PROGRAM. SECOND CAL COULD STICK APPROVAL FROM CMS TO INCLUDE A C. T. AS A MEDIC CAL SPECIALTYMENTAL HEALTH SERVICE UNDER SECTION ONE ONE ONE FIVE WAIVER. AS OTHER STATES HAVE DONE. AGAIN THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR INVITING DRC'S BE PART OF THIS PANEL AND I AM HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT THE COMMITTEE MAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- NOW LET'S GO TO OUR PUBLIC DEFENDER STEPHANIE. REGULAR. KAREN COMMITTEE MEMBERS NAME STEPHANIE REGULAR I'M A BOARD MEMBER CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDER ASOCIATION A PUBLIC DEFENDER FOR TWENTY YEARS AND THE SUPERVISOR OF THE CONTRA COSTA COUNTY PUBLIC DEFENDER MENTAL HEALTH YET I TESTIFIED TODAY ON BEHALF OF CPA AND NOT CONTRA COSTA COUNTY. ON BEHALF OF. I AM GIVING US ATTENTION TO THE SEVENTEEN HUNDRED MEN AND WOMEN CURRENTLY CONFINED IN JAIL CELLS WAITING FOR NECESSARY MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT. AND I SUPPORT THE PROPOSALS TO INCREASE THAT CAPACITY EXPANDS COMMUNITY BASED RESTORATION. AND THE DEFENSE FUND IS A SMALL DIVERSION PROGRAMS. HOWEVER TO EFFECTIVELY ADDRESS THE NINETEEN WEIGHTLESS AND TO TREAT THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO SUFFER FROM MENTAL ILLNESS. BUT THE TECHNIQUE CARE THAT THEY DESERVE. FINDING TO DIVERT THESE INDIVIDUALS SHOULD OCCUR AT ALL STAGES OF THE CRIMINAL LEGAL SYSTEM. INCLUDING AT THE FIRST PLEASE CONTACT. AFTER REST AFTER I NEED A COMPETENCY AND AFTER RESTORATION NINE MILLION AN ADDITIONAL SIXTY SIX POINT EIGHT MILLION FOR STABILIZATION EARLY ACCESS TO TREATMENT FOR INDIVIDUALS I GUESS IT JUST WAIT. BUT AN INDIVIDUAL IS NOT PLACED ON THE ESTATE JUST WAIT LIST IMMEDIATELY UPON ARREST THE TIME BETWEEN ARREST AND COMMITMENT TAKES MONTHS IF NOT YEARS. THAT MEANS THAT NINETY ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS ALLOCATED FOR EARLY TREATMENT WILL ONLY BE PUT TO USE SEVERAL MONTHS AFTER MENTALLY ILL PERSONS INITIAL CONFINEMENT. AND ONLY FOR THOSE IN JAIL. BASED ON DSP DESIGN RESEARCH 45% OF INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE ON THE WAIT LIST. JUST YOU KNOW MORE TIME. MANY OF THOSE INITIAL ARRESTS FOR MISDEMEANOR OFFENSES RESULTING FROM ACUTE SYMPTOMS OF MENTAL ILLNESS. THE ADMINISTRATION HAS NOT ALLOCATED ANY FUNDING TO SUPPORT MENTALLY ILL PEOPLE CHARGED WITH MISDEMEANORS. NOR DOES THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL SUPPORT THOSE TANSITIONING FROM JAILS TO THE COMMUNITY. EARLY ACCESS TO TREATMENT AND DIVERSION SURE CARL LONG BEFORE THE FIFTEENTH ARREST IN PLACE SPENT ON THE STATE HOSPITAL WAIT LAST. WE CANNOT AND SHOULD NOT EXPECT REDUCE THE WAIT LIST IF THE STATE DOES NOT ADDRESS THOSE UPSTREAM AT THE ADMINISTRATION'S TARGETED SOLUTIONS. TO MAXIMIZE OPPORTUNITIES OPPORTUNITIES TO DIVERT INDIVIDUALS LAW ENFORCEMENT MUST HAVE ACCESS TO SEPARATE CENTRIST CRISIS RESIDENTIAL FOR THOSE IN NEED OF IMMEDIATE CARE. COUNTIES NEED FUNDING TO BURKE TO DIVERT ALL INDIVIDUALS ELIGIBLE FOR COMMUNITY BASED TREATMENT NOT JUST THOSE IDEAS SIX WEEKS LAST. AND THOSE WHO ARE UNLIKELY TO BE RESTORING GREATLY DISABLED MUST BE REDIRECTED TO APPROPRIATE SYSTEMS OF CARE AT THE BEGINNING RATHER THAN THE END OF COMPETENCY PROCEEDINGS. TO THE EXTENT THAT CONRAD AND KEEPS THE PROGRESS OF THE STATE I FAILING TO RECOMMEND COMMUNITY BASED TREATMENT OR DIVERSION. THE ANSWER SHOULD NOT BE TO FIND AN INDEPENDENT PANEL TO DO CONTRACTS JOB. WHILE STILL FINDING CONRAD. THE ANSWER SHOULD BE TO DISPATCH CONRAD. THE MINISTRY CERTAINLY. IT'S JUST PROPOSAL FIFTY DECREE. FRAME MANY'S COMMITTEE WITH CARE. BUT I THE COMMITTEE AND THE ACCORDING ASK OF PROPOSAL FIRST DEFINING PROVIDES GRET NEW BAD AND NOT SOMETHING REPURPOSE IT BY FOR D. YES. IT IS WOULD ONLY PUT FURTHER STRAIN AND GREAT I JUST COME FOR THE LIMIT NUMBER MENTAL THAT'S CURRENTLY IN. SECOND THE STATE DO MORE TO HELP THOSE IN NEED OF THE AND THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE AS UPON THEIR- NOT JUST FOR THE- PERIOD OF TIME. AT THE- LESS. AND FINE. WE CONTINUE TO USE OUR- AS A CRUTCH ARE VERY BROKEN MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM. AS LONG AS THE STATE CONTINUES TO POUR MONEY INTO JAIL TREAT MENTALLY ILL PEOPLE ARE DEALS WILL CONTINUE TO BE OUR DE FACTO CRISIS CENTERS. I HAVE TO BELIEVE THAT JUST BECAUSE WE FIND YES SILENCE AT A HUNDRED YEARS AGO DEPLORABLE THAT FUTURE GENERATIONS WILL FIND OUR STATE JAIL BASED TREATMENT EQUALLY UNACCEPTABLE. THE FACT THAT WE ARE RIGHT NEXT TO CRISIS DOES NOT MAKE IT ANY MORE JUSTIFIABLE OR ANY LAST. THANK YOU. FOR HEY MAN. LET'S GO TO BRENDA GRAIN LASH FROM THE COUNCIL CRIMINAL JUSTICE AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CARE GOOD MORNING I THANK YOU SENATOR EGGMAN CENTER POUND FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE COUNCIL ON CRIMINAL JUSTICE AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH OR C. C. G. B. H. MY NAME IS BRENDA GREALISH AND I'M CURRENTLY CCG BEATRICE EXECUTIVE OFFICER PRIOR TO THAT I WAS ACTUALLY COUNCIL MEMBER SINCE TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN. ESTABLISHED IN TWO THOUSAND ONE CCB WHICH IS A TWELVE MEMBER COUNCIL CHAIRED BY THE SECRETARY OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION AND IS COMPRISED OF THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE HOSPITALS DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES AS WELL AS APPOINTED REPRESENTATIVES WHO ARE EXPERTS IN CRIMINAL JUSTICE AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH FIELD SUCH AS PROBATION COURTS AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AS WELL AS EDUCATION. AND CONSUMERS ARE FAMILY MEMBERS. A. B. H. CONTRACT WITH NO. OR ARE REPRESENTING INDIVIDUALS WITH LIVED EXPERIENCE IN THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEMS. SO THAT THEIR PERSPECTIVES ARE INCLUDED WHEN DEVELOPING OUR ANNUAL RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE ADMINISTRATION AND LEGISLATURE IN OUR ANNUAL LEGISLATIVE REPORT. AND TRANSFORM OUR DISCUSSIONS AND OUR WORK PRODUCTS. OVER TWENTY YEARS PAGE HAS WORKED TO DECREASE THE PREVALENCE OF INDIVIDUAL SUFFERING WITH SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESSES WHO BECOME INCARCERATED IN JAILS AND PRISONS BY ADVOCATING FOR MORE ROBUST COMMUNITY BASED TREATMENT AND SUPPORT SYSTEMS. UNFORTUNATELY EXISTENCE ON OUR OUR LEGISLATIVE REPORTS THERE CONTINUES TO REMAIN A STUBBORNLY PERSISTENT OVER REPRESENTATION OF INDIVIDUALS WITH MENTAL ILLNESSES IN JAILS AND PRISONS WHICH IS ALSO REFLECTED IN THE HIGH NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS ON THE APARTMENT SHE HOSPITAL'S FELONY I JUST YOU WAIT LISTS. AND GIVEN OUT RIGHT NOW WE JUST HAVE AN INCREDIBLE OPPORTUNITY TO RIGHT THIS WRONG USING INVESTMENTS AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SYSTEMS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE. IN THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS AS WELL AS THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN ARE BEING PROPOSED FOR THE UPCOMING FISCAL YEAR. I CAN SAY I'VE BEEN IN THIS FIELD FOR TWENTY YEARS AND GOVERNMENT AND THIS IS JUST. AN UNPRECEDENTED TIME FOR INVESTMENTS IN OUR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SYSTEMS ARE VERY EXCITED. TO BE PART. OF THIS THESE EFFORTS. OTHER BURKE STATE HOSPITAL I S. T. SO. PROPOSAL IS AND- SHE COMES. OF OUT THE M. BUT IT'S BEEN SORELY NEEDED FOR DECADES. CCAB H. AS LONG ADVOCATED FOR COMMUNITY BASED TREATMENT RATHER THAN PLACING INDIVIDUALS AND LOCAL JAILS PRETTY MUCH THREW. OUT THE ENTIRE DURATION OF OUR EXISTENCE I CAN GO BACK TO THE EARLIEST LET'S REPORTS ARM AND SEE THAT THAT THIS CONGRESS CONVERSATIONS WERE- WERE BEING MADE- OCCURRING. SH AND THE DISH DIVERSION PROGRAM. PROVIDES OPPORTUNITIES. TO ACHIEVE THIS VISION. SINCE TWO EIGHTEEN SEASON GBH COLOR CLOSELY WITH DISH ON THEIR DIVERSION PROGRAM WHICH PROVIDED A- QUITE A BIT OF. DIVERSION TRAINING AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE BECAUSE DIVERSION IS AN EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION AND STABILIZATION ALONG WITH. THE RESULTS FROM THE RISK ASSESSMENTS ARE KEYS TO UNLOCKING THE CONFIDENCE AMONG CRIMINAL JUSTICE PARTNERS SO THAT THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE TOO. SO THAT THEY KNOW THAT THESE INDIVIDUALS WILL NOT POSE A THREAT TO PUBLIC SAFETY. AS SUCH BY PROVIDING STABILIZATION SERVICES LONG WITH THE NECESSARY CARE COORDINATION DISHES PROPOSAL WILL MOVE THESE INDIVIDUALS CLOSER TO COMMUNITY BASED TREATMENT RATHER THAN INCARCERATION BASED TREATMENT TO THE POINT OF START MY SUMMER ME. I'M WITH THREE TO DISHES PROPOSED TRICKS YOUR FELONY I TEACHING PRO. VIA COMMITTEE BASED REST- AND DIVERT AND THEN INCREASE CHRISTMAS TO CONRAD AND TRANSITION TO COUNTY SERVICES. AGAIN YOU SEE GBH LONG ADVOCATED FOR MORE HOUSING AS WELL AS A RESIDENTIAL AND PSYCHIATRIC IN PATIENT TREATMENT FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS USED INCLUDING THOSE WHO BECOME. WITH THE CRIMINAL JUST INVOLVED WITH THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM- FOR HOUSING WE'VE MADE. IS RIGHT. ON OUR AND LARGEST REPORTS I DEVELOPED FACT AND FULL REPORT I'M SO. MOST RECENTLY LAST WE- LAUNCHED A REPORT FUNDED BY THE MELVILLE. TRUST WITH THE COUNCIL ON STATE GOVERNMENT'S JUSTICE CENTER OUR ENTITLED REDUCING HOMELESSNESS FOR PEOPLE WITH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH NEEDS LEAVING PRISONS AND JAILS. AND LATE LAST YEAR AND ON UNTIL APRIL THIS YEAR WE WERE EXCITED TO LAUNCH A WEB IN OUR SERIES WITH ERIC JOHNSON STATE GOVERNMENT'S JUSTICE CENTER FUNDED BY THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH CARE FOUNDATION- TO. EDUCATE ON THE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THAT REPORT ON YOUR WEB IN OUR SERIES ENTITLED BUILDING BLOCKS FOR COMING HOME. HOW CALIFORNIA COMMUNITIES CAN CREATE HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES FOR PEOPLE WITH COMPLEX NEEDS. LEADING THE JUSTICE SYSTEM. CCJ BEAD ALSO. FEEDBACK THE U. S. IN. COUNCIL ON. SEVEN FORMER DEVELOPMENT IN THEIR NEXT FEDERAL STRATEGIC PLAN TO THE DOCTOR KELLY'S POINT ABOUT ON SOME OF THE- POLICIES THAT ARE IN PLACE THAT BUT OFTEN PREVENT OUR POPULATION- I. FROM READ BUT SHE BEING ACCESS TO HOUSING SERVICES SO I KNOW THERE'S AFTER IT'S UNDER WAY TO TRY TO ALLEVIATE- AND REMOVE THOSE BARRIERS. AND THEN WENT ON TO ACTUALLY. OR- HOMELESSNESS AND HOUSING FIRST. IN ADDITION ARE WITH REGARD TO RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT HAS BEEN A SIGNIFICANT CONCERN FOR OUR COUNCIL MEMBERS- WHICH AGAIN PUT PUT RECOMMENDATIONS ON OUR PRIOR YEAR LEGISLATIVE REPORTS AND COMES FROM SOME OF OUR CONCERNS ABOUT THE LACK OF TREATMENT CAPACITY WAS EXPRESSED AS RECENTLY AS- DECEMBER AND JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND JANUARY TWENTY TWO. KOK COUNCIL MEETINGS. ADDITIONS PROPOSAL TO PROVIDE FUNDING FOR HOUSING RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT CAPACITY IS JUST ABSOLUTELY FOUNDATIONAL IN ORDER FOR THEIR TREATMENT FOR DIVERSION OF CLIENTS TO HAVE A CHANCE OF BEING AFFECTED I CAN'T STRESS HOW IMPORTANT HOUSING IS A TRUE AND I'M SURE AFFECT OF TREATMENT IT'S JUST IT'S JUST ACTUALLY FOUNDATIONAL. ARE ON A PARALLEL PATHS- OTHER EFFORTS SUCH AS DHS'S CALIFORNIA ADVANCING AND INNOVATING MEDIKAL THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONTINUUM INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAM OR EGYPT AND CRISIS CARE MOBILE UNITS PROGRAM PLUS OUR SOCIAL SERVICES CALIFORNIA BERMAN SOCIAL SERVICES COMMUNITY CARE EXPANSION AND HOUSING AND COMMUNITY COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT AND CAL ICHR INTERAGENCY COUNCIL ON HOMELESSNESS IS EFFORTS I WILL CONTINUE TO BUILD OUT THE COMMUNITY INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WILL IDEALLY PREVENT ANY OR FURTHER CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM INVOLVEMENT FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH MENTAL ILLNESSES. SO BASICALLY IN SOME ADDITIONAL IDEAS TO SOLUTIONS PROPOSAL OFFERS A STABLE ONGOING. MUCH NEEDED. BONDING SOURCE FOR FROM I AM YOU DIVERT. WHICH IS A KEY. FOR THAT FULL BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONTINUE ON AND SOMETHING THAT I KNOW BAY COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH HAS BEEN REQUESTING IN ORDER FOR THEIR TREATMENTS TO BE A FACTOR EXPRESS SUPPORT FOR THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED INVESTMENTS THAT WILL BENEFIT THIS POPULATION. INCLUDING THOSE RELATED TO PREVENTION EXPANDING TREATMENT CAPACITY IN INFRASTRUCTURE SO AGAIN CALENDAR CRISIS RESPONSE EXTRA EXPANDING MEDICATION ASSISTED TREATMENT. WORKFORCE SO FORENSIC YOUR SUPPORT SPECIALIST AND COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS AND THE PSYCHIATRIC RESIDENT PROGRAM SPOHR EXAMPLES AND HOUSING SO THE BRIDGE HOUSING RETURNING HOME WHILE AND HOUSING PROPOSED AND- DISHES I S. T. SOLUTIONS PROPOSAL. ALSO ANY EFFORTS THAT CAN PROMOTE AND ENCOURAGE COLLABORATION AMONG STATE ENTITIES STATE AND LOCAL ENTITIES AND AMONG LOCAL ENTITIES. AND FORMER INDIVIDUALS WITH LIVED EXPERIENCE AND THEIR FAMILIES WILL BE ABSOLUTE KEY TO MAXIMIZING THE- EFFICACY OF AND EFFICIENCY OF THESE INVESTMENTS. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME TODAY AND YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. LET'S NOW GO. TO MICHAEL RATIO WITH THE ACLU. MY NAME IS MICHAEL RESTORED- COUNCIL. NORTHERN CALIFORNIA I INVITING OUR INPUTS ARE ENGINE COMES BE CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLES ARE AT ISSUE HERE. THE ADMINISTRATION'S RESPONSE SERVICE. WHAT LEGISLATURE CAN DO TO PREVENT OTHER CONSTITUTIONAL VIOLATIONS OF. THE RIGHTS OF ICE TWO DEFENDANTS. STATE AND FEDERAL COUNTY PROHIBIT THE PROSECUTION OF A PURSE WHO IS UNABLE TO ANSWER THOSE ON OUR DEFENSE. WHAT THAT MEANS WHEN ELSE DOWN ABOUT THE DEFENDANT'S COMPETENCE CRIMINAL BUSQUETS. THE DANGER THIS IS THAT WHEN THAT HAPPENS OF THE CURRENT A PROVISION THAT PROTECT CRIMINAL DEFENDANTS RATES ARE EVAPORATES AND PERHAPS MOST IMPORTANT IMPORTANTLY THAT INCLUDES THE RIGHT TO A SPEEDY TRIAL AND THE RIGHT TO BAIL. FOR INGRAHAM TIME THE COPS BACK THANK YOU CHARGED WITH MINOR YOU FOUNDER. TO STAND LITERALLY THE REST OF THEIR LIVES IN PRISON FIFTY YEARS AGO THE SUPREME COURT HELD THAT VIOLATED DUE PROCESS. AND ANY CONFINEMENT APPLIES TO DISTRACT THEM OR SOMEONE SUSPECT BRST MUST BE JUSTIFIED TOWARDS EVALUATION AND THE ATTAINMENT OF COMPLIMENTS. BASED ON THAT WILL TWENTY CHANGE BECAUSE YOU'RE YOU'RE CONTACTED THE STATE HOSPITALS AND THE START BOUNCE DEPARTMENT MITCHELL STARC. TO STAY THAT THEY WERE BY. THIS PRESS WAS CAUGHT. PRINCIPLE BECAUSE THEY WERE. FAILING TO PROVIDE TIMELY TREATMENT PEOPLE COURSE THE LANES RANGE JOHNSON MONTHS MORE WE CONTACTED THEM TRIED TO RESOLVE THE- SITUATION THEY REFUSE THAT WE SUED THEM AND AS YOU KNOW THE COURT AGREED WITH US AND ISSUE THIS TWENTY EIGHT DAY DEADLINE. NOW BECAUSE OF. COURT RULING DSHS FINALLY TO STEP TO ADDRESS THE LONG STANDING PROBLEM HAS BEEN A PROBLEM FOR MORE THAN A DECADE AT THIS POINT. IN TERMS OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSALS ARE LIKE THE REST OF THE PANELISTS ARE WE AGREE WITH THE OVERWHELMING GOALS. COMMUNITY TREATMENT AND DIVERSION ARE MUCH MORE COST EFFECTIVE AND MUCH BETTER FOR HONESTY INDIVIDUALS ARE NOT ONLY DO THEY FOR THE NEW FOREIGN CARS RUSSIAN BUT THEY HAVE BETTER LONG TERM. OUTCOMES BECAUSE THEY ARE THEY INVOLVED HOUSING IN THE COMMUNITY. ARE THEY HAVE A BROADER FOCUS. NEVERTHELESS THE DOUBLES THE DETAILS AND I SHARE THE CONCERNS RAISED ON PARTICULAR BY MISS PETERSON IN THIS REGULAR- AND ALSO I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THE GROWTH CAP THAT'S BEEN MENTIONED BEFORE. ARE ALSO WE WILL NEED TO MONITOR AND SEE HOW THE ON STAGE IS ACTUALLY IMPLEMENTING THESE- THESE NEW PROPOSALS WITH LEGISLATURE. YOU IN TERMS OF PREVENTING OTHER CONSTITUTIONAL VIOLATIONS OF THE RIGHT. THE STATE REGULATOR GAUGING AFFECTED ONLY ONE SLICE OF THE STOP OF THIS. S. S. AND AS YOU HEARD FROM HIS REGULAR THE DELAYS THAT PROCEED YOU CAN COMPENSATE AND A COMMITMENT TO THE STATE HOSPITAL CAN CAN BE TRUSTED LONG CAN BE LONGER AND CERTAINLY ARE JUST AS HARMFUL AS THOSE DELAYS THAT WE DEALT WITH AND STEER READY. TO LEGISLATION TO REDRESS THOSE- BY IMPOSING DEADLINES FOR THE PROCESS OF APPOINTING ALIEN AS- MAKING THE TERMINATION OF INCUMBENCY OR NOT AND ALSO THE COMMITMENT ACTUAL COMMITMENT AFTER THAT. IT SHOULD ENSURE THAT THERE ARE NONE. SPECIALIST EVALUATE. OUR DEFENSE SEE WHETHER THERE SPECTRUM. AND PERHAPS MOST IMPORTANTLY SHE THAT. IS AVAILABLE BEFORE THAT COMMITMENT HERE AND IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE THAT SOMEONE HAS TO WAIT BE EVALUATED. MULTIPLE EVALUATIONS BEFORE THEY'RE ELIGIBLE FOR DIVERSION NEEDS TO HAPPEN MUCH EARLIER IN THE PROCESS SO WE CAN DIVERT PEOPLE OUT OF THIS EXTREMELY LANDSCAPING- ONEROUS AND EXPENSIVE PROCESS. AND OF COURSE I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS BUT IT'S NOT THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANNELISE HEAR FROM SANDRA THIS IS A MEMBER OF A FAMILY MEMBER OF AN I. S. T. PATIENT WELCOME. YOU'RE STILL ON MUTE. CAN YOU HEAR ME YES. GOOD MORNING THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF MY COUSIN CAN YOU CAN YOU TURN UP THE VOLUME A LITTLE BIT OR MOVE A LITTLE BIT CLOSER TO THE MICROPHONE. IS THAT BETTER THAT'S MUCH BETTER THANK YOU. MY CONCERN WAS. CHRISTMAS DAY IN TWENTY TWENTY. AND HE WAS CHARGED WITH MAKING TERRORIST THREATS. R. THIS WAS DIRECTLY LINKED TO HIS MENTAL. HE'S HAD NO PRIOR CONVICTIONS IN MARCH OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE A JUDGE FOUND HIM INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL. HE HAS BEEN IN CUSTODY FOR FOUR HUNDRED AND TWELVE DAYS SINCE HIS ARREST. A THREE HUNDRED THIRTY EIGHT DAYS. SINCE HIS COMPETENCY DETERMINATION HE HAS NOT BEEN TRANSFERRED TO A STATE HOSPITAL HE HAS NOT BEEN DIVERTED. HE DOESN'T REALLY RECEIVE ANY KIND OF TREATMENT WE WERE HOPING THAT HE WOULD GET MENTAL HEALTH DIVERSION BUT THAT DID NOT HAPPEN. AT THIS TIME MY COUSIN IS LOCKED UP IN A CELL FOR OVER TWENTY THREE HOURS A DAY. FOR THE FORTY FIVE MINUTES IT IS ALLOWED OUT HE TAKES A SHOWER AND HE CALLS ME. EVERY DAY WHEN HE CALLS ME HE ASKED ME THE SAME QUESTION. WHEN AM I GOING TO GET OUT. I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S TÌM KIÞM. MY COUSIN IS AUTISTIC. HE HAS SCHIZO AFFECTIVE DISORDER. FROM THE TIME THAT HE WAS A YOUNG BOY HE WAS PLACED IN AND OUT OF MENTAL HOSPITALS HE ALSO SUFFERED SEVERE PHYSICAL ABUSE. AT HOME AND AT SCHOOL. MIKE IS NOT. HE DOES HAVE MELTDOWNS BECAUSE OF THE AUTISM. HE DOES STRUGGLE WITH HEARING VOICES IN HIS HEAD STRUCTURE AND YOU READ IRAQ JIM. YOU CAN GET THROUGH THOSE MELTDOWNS. JOHN SMALL WAS HIS ROCK AND HE WAS VERY PROTECTIVE OF HER. SHE PASSED AWAY ONE MONTH. AFTER JOHN GOT ARRESTED. HE DOESN'T SEEM TO UNDERSTAND THAT HIS MOM IS GONE HE THINKS THAT WHEN HE COMES BACK OVER HERE THAT. SHOWING ERROR. I'M SORRY. BUT WHEN JOHN WAS TAKEN INTO CUSTODY HE LOST HIS HOUSING I HAVE FOUND IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING HE'S LOST HIS SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS HE LOST HIS PERSONAL POSSESSIONS BECAUSE WE HAD TO VACATE THE APARTMENT I BELIEVE THAT MY COUSIN HAD BEEN PLACED IN A COMMUNITY TREATMENT PROGRAM HE WOULD HAVE RESPONDED TO TREATMENT ONCE AGAIN HE'S NEVER BEEN VIOLENT HE'S NEVER HIT ANYBODY HE JUST USES WORDS HEARING HAS NOT FOUND. AT THE TIME THAT HE WAS TAKEN INTO CUSTODY. I TRIED SO HARD TO FIND PSYCHIATRIST. SOCIAL WORKERS CASE MANAGEMENT FOR HIM BUT BECAUSE THE CULPRIT I THINK THE SERVICES ONE LIKE WHAT EXISTED SO AT THE LAST MINUTE THE APPOINTMENTS WOULD BE CANCELED. NOW WHILE HE'S IN CUSTODY HE DOES SEE A PSYCHIATRIST I BELIEVE OVER. THE TELEVISION AND HE SEES THIS DOCTOR EVERY THREE MONTHS FOR ABOUT FIFTEEN MINUTES AND THEN ON OCCASION A SOCIAL WORKER MAY COME TO VISIT. I'D LIKE TO SEE MY COUSIN COME HOME AND RECLAIM HIS LIFE. I BELIEVE THAT HE WOULD BENEFIT FROM THE MENTAL HEALTH DIVERSION PROGRAM THAT WOULD ALLOW HIM TO GET CLOSE TO HOME AND HE'S WELCOME IN MY HOME. AND IT WOULD AVOID CONVICTION. ON HIS RECORD. IT WOULD ALLOW HIM TO BE ABLE TO SIX CARE AFFORDABLE HOUSING ONCE AGAIN. I HOPE THE CALIFORNIA REFORM SEX CRIMINAL MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM ALL PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO TREATMENT THEY NEED WITHIN THE COMMUNITY I DON'T THINK SHE WAS A PLACE FOR PEOPLE LIKE JOHN. WHO STRUGGLE WITH MENTAL ILLNESSES AND IN ESSENCE ARE ABANDONED WAREHOUSE AND FORGOTTEN. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY IN AND THANK YOU FOR BEING SUCH A GOOD COUSIN. I KNOW THAT'S A TOUGH JOURNEY TO TEST. TO GO ON AND I'M ALSO SORRY FOR THE LOSS OF YOUR AUNT- WHAT COUNTY DO YOU LIVE IN MA'AM. UNDER CURRENT RATE KERN COUNTY OKAY AND I DISCUSSED OUR STUFF TO FOLLOW UP TO SURE ACCESSING REESE WE CAN. MMHM BERMAN SANDBERG AND HER COUSIN- THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATIONS AND THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE COLLABORATIVE PROCESS THAT YOU'VE BEEN WILLING TO ENGAGE IN A AND OF COURSE ALL OF YOU POINT TO THE AT THE- BUT- THE WHOLE THE GAPS. IN OUR SYSTEM AND THAT THE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN FALLING THROUGH FOR YEARS AND YOU ALL OF KNOWLEDGE THAT. IN THE LAST COUPLE YEARS WE HAVE MADE HISTORIC INVESTMENTS. IN ALL OF KNOWLEDGE THAT IT WILL TAKE A WHILE FOR ALL OF THESE. DOLLARS IN INVESTMENTS TO HIM TO BE WHERE THEIR SUPPOSED TO BE. BUT AS WERE ENVISIONING THIS- THIS GREAT NEW FUTURE- I WANTED TO ASK DR KELLY IF SHE COULD RESPOND- IF YOU COULD RESPOND BOTH TO- I DIDN'T MISS REGULARS A POINT ABOUT HOW MANY TIMES. THAT THAT THERE IS NO THERE'S NO CONTACT WHILE PEOPLE ARE HAVE BEEN ARRESTED SOME BABY FORTY TIMES UNDER MISDEMEANORS REYES AND WE'VE IDENTIFIED THAT BEFORE THAT IS A HUGE ISSUE TO SPEAK TO THAT WHAT WHAT THE COUNTIES ARE DOING ARE THERE ANY. OTHER ANY COUNTIES THAT ARE DOING IT A LOT BETTER. AT BEING ABLE TO DO EARLIER INTERVENTIONS AND PREVENTIONS AND THEN ALSO TO RESPOND TO- THE COMPUTER SINCE POINT ABOUT THE- ACT OR A PACKED OR SOME KIND OF EVIDENCE BASED. ON A TREATMENT THAT THEN COULD BE. IS ANYBODY USING ONE- IS OUR OWN A. O. T. N. N. LINEUP I'M LOOKING AT THE COMPONENTS OF IT IN LINE WITH WITH SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND WHEN PEOPLE TELL ME STOP THERE BECAUSE IT WAS OF A COUPLE QUESTIONS SO THEY RESPOND TO. THEM WHAT IS THE COUNTIES HAVE IN PLACE AND IS THERE ANY CONSISTENCY- BUT THEN AGAIN I'M AND I HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIPS TO HOWARD HOWARD THE- THROUGH AN HSA ENGAGED- OF THE PEOPLE BEFORE WAY BEFORE THE MISDEMEANOR THAT ARE THAT ARE PILING UP. WHAT KIND OF EARLIER- IDENTIFICATION AND INTERVENTION ARE THE COUNTIES DOING ANSWER ANY BEST PRACTICE MODEL. OKAY THANK YOU VERYMUCH SENATOR SOLOMON TRYING. FROM CUSTOMER. ALMOST ALL OF OUR COUNTIES ARE DOING OUTREACH AND ENGAGEMENT IN SOME CAPACITY AND I CAN TALK TO HEAR AN ORANGE COUNTY WE HAVE ENTIRE TEAM ABOUT REACH AND ENGAGEMENT WORKERS WHO THAT'S WHAT THEY DO THEY GO OUT THEY LOOK FOR FOLKS. WHO MIGHT BE IN NEED OF SERVICES AND THEY START BACK. INTENSA RELATIONSHIP BUILDING THAT YOU ADDRESSED IN ADDITION THEY ALSO ARE DEPLOYED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT AND SO LAW ENFORCEMENT WILL CALL IF THEY HAVE SOMEONE THAT THEY KNOW IS PROBABLY DEALING WITH A MENTAL ILLNESS OR SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER AND THE TEAM ALSO GOES AND TRIES TO ENGAGE THEM. 20% OF THE FOLKS THAT WE AND WE ASK CMS'S ABOUT STANDARD DROUGHT ALL OF OUR COUNTIES AND- PRIVATE INSURANCE COVERAGE WE STILL SEE THEM WE STILL HOOKED THEM UP WITH RESOURCES I WANT TO JUST DROP THAT DIFFERENTIATION THAT COUNTY IS CERTAINLY MEDIKAL PROVIDER BUT WE ALSO ARE THAT THE- SAFETY NET AND SO. WHEN WE SEE SOMEONE IN NEED WE'RE NOT JUST SAYING ARE YOU DON'T HAVE AN ACCOUNT LIVING ON WE. ARE CONNECTING THEM WITH THEIR PROVIDER. ALSO PROVIDER. AND SO THERE ARE OTHER. EVIDENCE BASE PRACTICES AND SOME. FOR COUNTIES OR DO IN SAN DINO THEY- AND- FOR. ON ACTIVATION- ED TREATMENT FROM. IN THAT WILL DEPLOYS. THE SHARE. ARE HOMELESS. GROUP THEY GO TO WHERE PEOPLE ARE IN NEED IMPROVED. HOME YOU CAN AND THEY STAR TO REALLY. BUILDING THEY GO WITH EIGHT PUBLIC NURSE. I GO WITH A- THESE SERVICE PARKED. OF CAN MAKE PEOPLE HAVE. AND THEY KNOW WHAT THIS BE AT WHAT IS A TO THE- WE ACTIVATE THE TO TREAT RIGHT NOW SO WE START ON MEDICAID. AND WHILE WE ARE GETTING THEM READY FOR HOUSING BUT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THAT CONNECTION WITH THEM. AT YOUR POINT ABOUT GETTING TREATMENT OUT IN ADDITION WE ALSO NEED THEY ALSO USE VETERINARY CARE THEY BRING UP THAT WAS FOUND THAT'S ABOUT A REALLY GOOD PRACTICE TO GET IN WITH. A PEOPLE WHO ARE LIVING ON THE STREETS ENCAMPMENTS AND SUCH. A LOT OF OTHER COUNTIES DO THE VERY SAME THING THAT THEY RESPOND. TO THE LARA IS. LARGELY A O. T. PROCESS. NEVADA COUNTY AS YOU NOW IS THERE VERY SIX. WITH THAT. BY THE NUMBERS ARE NOT VERY LOW ONE LOOKING AT A T. H. MOVING TO THE- START OF A TRAIN EACH. I'LL COUNTY JULY ACT IT DOESN'T BASED PRACTICE MUCH BY THIS HE'S ARE AN AVID BASED. IN ORANGE AND NEW CAL HERE AND CAL WE USE FS PEACE A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY AND WE HAVE THEM FOR. A DIFFERENT POPULATION SO ALL COUNTIES ARE DOING THEM STANDARDIZED BUT WE ARE USING THEM WITH POPULATIONS THAT MAKES SENSE SO YOU MIGHT HAVE A HOMELESS FSP WE WILL HAVE A FORENSIC FSP SO THERE'S A LITTLE BIT MORE EXPERTISE IN PARTICULAR POPULATION. SO THOSE ARE ALL PRACTICES THAT WE ARE DOING AND I'M A I WANT TO MAKE SURE I POINT OUT THAT THOSE ARE NOT MEDICAL BILLABLE SERVICES WE MOSTLY USE I JUST EIGHT DOLLARS AND NINETY ONE REALIGNMENT TO LEVERAGE THAT WORK FORCE. WE ARE NOT OPENING A CASE FOR SOMEONE IN THE FIELD BECAUSE THEY DON'T TRUST US ENOUGH TO COMPLETE OUR FULL ASSESSMENT TO SIGN A TREATMENT PLAN FOR US TO BEGIN BUILDING YOU KNOW CALTRAIN WILL CHANGE SOME OF THAT. THAT IS NOT PRECLUDING **** OR PROHIBITING US FROM ENGAGING IN SERVICES WHEN WE FIND PEOPLE RECEIVE REFERRALS WE ARE OUT THERE BUT AS YOU STATED AS WELL A LOT OF FOLKS ARE JUST NOT INTERESTED IN OUR SERVICES AND IT IS UP TO US AS CLINICIANS TO TALK THEM INTO THAT. MOST OF THAT COMES WITH RELATIONSHIP BUILDING AGAIN FORTY VISITS FOR IN PERSON. TWENTY FOR SOMEONE WHO IS LIVING WITH THEIR FAMILY. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND I. EVERYBODY WHO TO TALK TO HAS ALL. I MEAN TECHNOLOGY RECORD. THE FEE. THE CREW ROLE THAT HOUSE PLACE AND ALL OF THIS. HE WE HAVE SOMETHING GOING OFF YEARS. OKAY THAT THAT HOUSING PLACE AND ALL OF THIS- AND AGAIN THAT WE HAVE REALLY BEEN WORKING VERY HARD TO MAKE THOSE KINDS OF INVESTMENTS AND OF COURSE THE FRUSTRATING PART IS IT'S GOING TO TAKE SOME TIME ANOTHER ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I THINK WOULD DO ALLUDE TO OF. DATA IN COORDINATION THAT WE HAVE TO KNOW THE IMPACT OF SOME OF THE INVESTMENTS THAT WE'VE ALREADY MADE. AND I OF COURSE IN ALL OF US ARE COMMITTED TO WORKING ON THAT- THANK YOU AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THE PRESENTATION FROM THE PANEL- IN CERTAINLY AGREE THAT- WE SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT THE AND THE CONTINUE ON WHICH INCLUDES THE HIGH RISK AND I DO WANT TO. JUST SIT ALSO SECOND- WHAT- CARE EGGMAN SAID MAYBE THEY REALIZE THAT THIS IS IN THE- YOU KNOW IN SECTION FOR THE STATE HOSPITALS AND THEY'RE ASKING A LOT OF TIME WE'RE ASKING A LOT OF TOUGH QUESTIONS BUT THIS IS OBVIOUS TO SCOPE IT IS MUCH LARGER RIGHT. AND IT THE AND SO FOR EXAMPLE WE TALK ABOUT TAKING CARE OF PEOPLE ARE AT RISK- HELLO WE SHOULD HAVE. DGS HERE AND WE SHOULD HAVE OTHER AGENCIES HERE AS WELL ALL RIGHT BECAUSE- THEY'RE PROVIDING MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES BEFORE PEOPLE GET HE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM WHICH IS. YOU KNOW WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING. RIGHT AND TRYING TO- SO. IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT I GUESS IF IT THE FEW QUESTIONS I HAVE HERE- SO. MAYBE FOR FIRST OF ALL FOR DR KELLY- WITH- TO BE FOR HEALTH DIRECTOR SO- DISABILITY RIGHTS- TOUTED THIS- THE THING CALLED THE START OF COMMITTEE TREATMENT. AND SAYS CALIFORNIA ISN'T DOING THAT- ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH THIS CAN YOU ADDRESSES IT IS THAT I MEAN IT'S- IS THAT SOMETHING THAT THAT WE SHOULD BE EXPLORING. FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE AS A HEALTH PROFESSIONAL. THANK YOU THE SENATE PANEL I WE ARE USING THAT OKAY SO THAT IS REALLY ACCESS TO CARE. RIGHT WELL THERE'S OKAY WELL THEN I THINK PERHAPS AS A CONVERSATION THERE AND THAT- THAT NEED TO BE HAD BECAUSE- AND THEN- THE OTHER QUESTION I HAD. WAS WAS MENTIONED BY THE- A PUBLIC DEFENDER AN AT NIGHT I CERTAINLY AND- AGREED- WE TALK ABOUT GETTING NEW BEDS IN THE PROPOSAL- THAT THE- THESE WILL GAIN BETTER WE'RE NOT JUST DRAWING FROM THE EXISTING WELL OF PSYCHIATRIC OR- MENTAL HEALTH- BEDS BUT- TRYING TO CREATE NEW BED SO- PERHAPS- MAYBE SHOULD GO BACK TO THE- THE POOREST. THE HOUSE WAS IS THE FUNDING FOR THIS IT WILL BE TALKING ABOUT GETTING MORE HOUSING SO FORTH I KNOW SOME OF THEM DO THIS REFERRED SOME OF IT SEEM LIKE IT WAS NEW. PADS BUT- ARE WE ARE WE PARTICULARLY DIRECTING TOWARD ACTUALLY BILL INCREASING THE CAPACITY NOT CONTRACTING FOR BEDS THAT ARE READY. FOR MENTAL HEALTH BUT AND NOW THEY'VE TOLD PEOPLE. THE WAY TO PLEASE FOR ICE TEA. THIS IS CHRIS YES THAT'S CORRECT THIS WOULD BE BUILDING NEW CAPACITY NOT TAKING FROM THE EXISTING COMMITTEE ASKING AVAILABLE. OKAY ALL RIGHT- AND I GUESS THE OTHER. THING IS AND I KNOW THE INDIRECT EMENDATIONS AND- MANY PEOPLE REFERRED TO CALTRAIN AND WE'RE GOING TO BE TALKING TO TEACHERS ABOUT CALLING- BUT I ALSO. FOUND SOME BECAUSE JUST AS THE WORLD CERTAINLY TREATING OPPORTUNITIES- WE GOT TO DELVE INTO THIS MORE AND MORE DETAIL DTS. I ALSO KNOW THAT- YOU KNOW TERMS OF PARTICULAR INTENSIVES SERVICE KOREA- CARE COORDINATION SO FORTH. I BELIEVE ONLY IF. THE TICKET IF IT NOT IT'S NOT TO BE BILLED EVERY IT'S ACTUALLY A FAIRLY SMALL PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE. SO ONE OF THINGS THAT WE CAN BE HELPFUL IS- EXACTLY HOW WHAT KIND OF KIND OF WHAT KIND OF CAPACITY ARE WE LOOKING FOR FROM CAL AIM TO SERVE CITIES PARTICULARLY- TALENT YOU KNOW HOW. MENTAL HEALTH CHALLENGE TO PATIENTS AND THEN SO QUICKLY BECAUSE WE GO TO DHS WANTED SAY OKAY WELL WHEN YOU'RE YOU KNOW UNDER CALAMP. HOW MUCH OF THOSE RESOURCES ARE YOU GONNA BE ON THE RACKS TOWARD THIS PARTICULAR PATIENT POPULATION SO IS. AND MAYBE THIS IS A QUESTION BACK TO DOCTOR KELLY SHE HAPPENS AND- OR MAYBE THE COUNCIL. IN THEIR DISCUSSIONS- BRENDA WILLIS. HAD SOMEONE TRY TO QUANTIFY- WHAT'S THE POPULAR ROUGHLY THE SIZE OF THE POPULATION AND THE NEED THAT WE'RE LOOKING TO- TO SERVE- THROUGH CAL AIM TO IS AS A WAY TO. ADDRESS ESSENTIALLY THE YOU KNOW AT RISK POPULATION FORTY OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. SO CAN I CAN EITHER ONE IF YOU PERHAPS SPEAK TO- WHAT THE WHAT THE NEED IS AND TO TAKE A QUANTITATIVE LEVEL ALL RIGHT I. SELL HOW. HOW MANY PEOPLE HOW MUCH MONEY. I'LL TRY DO A I MIGHT NOT KNOW OF EXACT BETTER CALL IN FOR US ON THE BEACH HEALTH SITES BEYOND WHAT THE MAN CARE PLAN ARE DOING. IT WILL ALLOW US. JAIL IN REACH WE HOPE THAT WE CAN START NOW THAT YOU KNOW THIS IT WHEN SOMEONE IS IN JAIL THAT WE COULD ACTUALLY TURN ON THE MEDIC CAL. NINETY DAYS PRIOR AND TREAT THEM AND GET PAID FOR THAT TREATMENT SO THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO EXPAND THE AMOUNT OF SERVICES THAT WOULD BE PROVIDING CUSTODY. FOR US ON THE GROUND IT ALLOWS FOR NO WRONG DOOR AND ALLOWS FOR AN EXPANSION OF WHAT SPECIALLY MENTAL HEALTH IS SO THAT IF I CAME ACROSS. A YOUNG MAN WHO NEEDED SERVICES BUT HE WASN'T AT MY LEVEL YET HE WASN'T SEVERELY AND PERSISTENTLY MENTALLY ILL. AND HE HAD A MILD OR MODERATE ON THIS THE STANDARD OF CARE IS THAT I WOULD REFER HIM WARM YOU KNOW WARM HAND OFF TO. A HAS MANAGED CARE PROVIDER CALLING WILL ALLOW ME TO START TREATMENT IMMEDIATELY BECAUSE PERHAPS I'VE DEVELOPED REPORT WITH THEM. I CAN START TREATMENT I CAN. BEGIN TO HELP AND TO DETERMINE WHAT IT DIAGNOSES IT IS HOW WE CAN BEST HELP CAPTURE AND THEN IF IT IF HE IS IN NEED OF A LOWER LEVEL CARE THEN TRANSITION TOWN BUT I CAN PROVIDE THE CARE RIGHT AWAY AND- TO SUPPORT THE WORK FORCE I CAN START TO BUILD MEDIKAL. WE DON'T DO ANY OF THAT WE DON'T BILL FOR AS I STATED IN CENTER EGGMAN QUESTION WHEN WE'RE OUT DOING CRISIS. STABILIZATION CRISIS RESPONSE AND COMMUNITY WE DON'T BILL FOR THE SERVICES SO IT MAKES OUR RESOURCES WHICH ARE ALREADY LIMITED BERRIES- EVEN MORE LIMITED. YEAH SO. I'M SORRY GO AHEAD. AND I'M TRYING TO ITS AND EVERY TO YOU'RE SAYING- AND- IT. I GUESS I'M TRYING TO DRILL DOWN MORE AROUND THE- AREA. OKAY SO YOU. S. MY- BUT IN THE END WE CAN LOOK AT THE I STEEP I GUESS IS THE PROGRESS MANY OF THE UNFORCED TO MORE SO THEY SET UP TIME MORE INTENSIVE CASE I TYPES OF THINGS PRIOR TO IT HITTING CHRONOLOGY SYSTEM. SO SANDRA TRYING TO GET A SENSE OF WHAT THE MAGNITUDE OF THE POPULATION IS. SO WE START TALKING THE DCS MORE TALK ABOUT CALAMP. SO YES I THINK THERE'S AN OPERA IS ARE WE GONNA TRY TO MEASURE THE SAMPLE WHAT IS THIS FREE AT RISK POPULATION. CANADA GETTING THE SERVICES AND TO WHAT DEGREE DOES ASIDE FROM THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IN THIS PARTICULAR YOU KNOW HOW MUCH OF THIS. NEED TO AT RISK YOU NEED RIGHTS TO TALK ABOUT THIS NOW CREATE A FLOW CHART. WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO ACTUALLY SERVE THROUGH CAL AIM THAT WOULD ALSO THAT IDEALLY HELP DIVERT THEM FROM EVER HITTING THE COLONEL JUSTICE SYSTEM SO. I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO QUANTIFY THAT. I THIS IS BRENDA GREALISH- AND I WOULD DEFER TO DH CS BECAUSE VERY- YOU KNOW HOW TO DEVELOP THE ESTIMATES FOR- ENHANCED YOUR MANAGEMENT SO I'M NOT SURE. WHAT WENT INTO THOSE ASSUMPTIONS FOR OR FOR HOW TO GET QUANTIFY THAT BUT THEY PROBABLY GET THE BEST SOURCE FOR THAT INFORMATION. OKAY SO- I WILL ASK THEM THAT BUT I ALSO WANT TO KNOW ON THIS AND MAYBE SOMEONE CAN IF YOU DON'T HAVE IT NOW SO I CAN GET BACK TO THIS WE HAVE THAT DISCUSSION WITH MURDER TALKING MANY OF CARE MANAGEMENT AGO BY TALK ABOUT. LOTS OF DIFFERENT POPULATIONS RIGHT. I'M ACTUALLY INTERESTED IN AS PARTICULAR ON THE MENTAL HEALTH SIDE AND- MADE A RELATION TO I WILL HI STEVE DIRECTOR TO COME A JUSTICE SYSTEM BUT SO THE AT RISK POPULATION. IS ONLY BE SURE WHEN I HEAR FROM DH CS ABOUT ENHANCE CARE MANAGEMENT. THAT IS INCLUSIVE OF ALL THE PEOPLE THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE WHO ARE AT RISK FOR I. S. T. AND THAT- BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PROGRAM THAT STARTING FROM AT RISK NOT JUST WHEN YOU FINALLY END UP IN JAIL. SO FORTH MORE DOWNSTREAM THAT WE ACTUALLY ARE BUILDING UP THOSE RESOURCES AS WELL SO- SO THAT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL BECAUSE WHEN WE HAVE THAT CONVERSATION WITH DCS WE WANT AT LEAST HAVE THAT IN OUR MIND- AND- KNOW WHAT TO ASK. THE CELLS ANYWAY ABLE TO HELP QUAN. THE. I SEE SOUNDS. DIRECTOR MOBILE CLINTON YOU WANNA TRY TO RECORD.

O- WE ATTRIBUTE THESE PROGRAMMING CASELOAD UPDATES- WITH NO CANCER HISTORY. DEPARTMENT FINANCE. THE NON DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE NOTHING THAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU STILL ARE HAVING SOME TROUBLE HIRING BUT I THINK WELCOME TO EVERYBODY ELSE'S WORLD SOME OF THESE POSITIONS THAT YOU HAVE THAT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO HIRE FOR YET. THAT'S CORRECT WE ARE REPORTING SOME HIRING CHALLENGES I THINK IT IT'S AS DIRECTOR CLENDENIN MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY ON ISSUE IT REMAINS A CHALLENGE BEFORE KOBE AND CERTAINLY HAS BEEN EXACERBATED DUE TO KOBE BUT- IT'S ALSO. AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO THINK DIFFERENTLY ABOUT OUR HIRING SO WE'RE CERTAINLY LOOKING AT OUR- HIRING AND RECRUITMENT PROCESS TO IDENTIFY EFFICIENCIES FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE AND ALSO. TRYING TO LEVERAGE THE PARTNERSHIPS WITH EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS AND ALSO TRYING TO KNOCK CONTRACTORS AND CONSULTANTS TO HELP US ADVERTISE IN DIFFERENT WAYS THAT WE HAVE BEEN DONE PREVIOUSLY. ARTICULATELY NOT ONLY FOR OUR LEVEL CARE CLINICAL CLASSIFICATIONS BUT ALSO IN OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT THROUGH THE OLD USE OF SOCIAL MEDIA. I THINK THERE ARE SOME BEST PRACTICES FROM OTHER DEPARTMENTS WERE TRYING TO LEVERAGE SO IT'S CERTAINLY A FOCAL POINT A ZERO POINT NINE MADAM CHAIR IT IS IT IS A CHALLENGE. THANK YOU I'M THANK YOU DOCTOR. I THANK YOU AGAIN LOT OF PROGRAMS- AND APPRECIATE QUESTION ABOUT HIRING AND SIMILAR QUESTION JUST A MAYBE SLIGHTLY RELATED TO THAT- IN TERMS OF IN ADDITION TO HIRING IN AND OF COURSE ATTENTION- WHEN YOU HAVE IT'S I DON'T KNOW HOW TO SINCE YOU CAN'T YOU HAVING SOME CHALLENGES FILLING POSITIONS SO FORTH. LISTED IN THE GERMAN PARLIAMENT OVERTIME AND- YOU KNOW BECAUSE AFTER ALL YOUR PATIENTS WHO HAD SOMEONE HAS TO TAKE CARE OF THEM SOMEBODY HAD NO PEOPLE STAFF. TO DO WHAT THE GREASE THAT ISSUE AND ARE YOU HAVING TO SPEND A LOT OF MONEY ON CONTRACTING OUT TO GET OF SOMEONE THE HOLES- OR ARE YOU ABLE TO DO THAT WITHIN YOUR OWN. WITH IN NEWTOWN EXISTING STAFF SO- IT'S- PASSAGE THE NO THERE ISN'T SOMETHING EXPLICIT NOTHING TO A SECTION ON THE APP. IT IS THAT IT IS THE SENATE AND IS THAT EXPAND IT IS SIGNIFICANT EXPENSE FOR THIS DEPARTMENT. CHANCE OF THAT QUESTION WE- WE DO NORMALLY RELY ON SORT OF MULTIPLE AVENUES TO BE ABLE TO MEET OUR STAFFING NEEDS AND TRY TO PREVENT A RELIANCE ON OVERTIME SO WE HAD. CERTAIN TOOLS WHERE. INTERNAL REGISTRY WILL WORK WELL WILL WE WILL RELY ON. TIMES STAFF FOR RETIRED A NEW WHICH TENDS TO FILL IN THE GAPS SO THAT WE DON'T ALWAYS HAVE TO RELY ON OVERTIME AS WELL AS- VOLUNTARY OVERTIME IS A AVAILABLE TO OUR STAFF MEMBERS- SOME FOLKS DON'T. RELY ON THAT IS WELL UNFORTUNATELY WE DO HAVE TO MANDATE OVERTIME AT TIMES IN ORDER- IN CERTAIN SITUATIONS. BUT WE ALSO DO CONTRACT OUT SO I THINK OUT OF ALL OF THESE OPTIONS IS SORT OF HOW WE TELL OUR STAFFING NEEDS AND IT'S AN ONGOING BALANCE- HAS BEEN BEFORE THE PANDEMIC AND CERTAINLY IT'S IS ALSO A BALANCE DURING THE PANDEMIC. OKAY APPRECIATE THAT I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS- BE INTERESTED IN LOOKING INTO THE TO FIELD AGAIN OR BUDGET COMMITTEE IS THE EXPENSE OF THAT PARTICULARLY- TO WHAT DEGREE DO YOU NEED- FIND YOURSELF HAVING TO CONTRACT OUT VERSUS THE ON THE USE I GUESS INTERNAL STAFF FOR. OTHER TYPES OF OPTIONS AS WELL SO- SO JUST TO APPRECIATE OR SOME- INFORMATION CAN GET BACK TO US ON THAT LATER THANK YOU.

FOR BACKGROUND PURPOSES NAPA STATE HOSPITAL MANAGE JUST FIVE DIFFERENT WATER STORAGE FACILITIES WHICH HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN USED TO MEET. THE NEEDS OF THE FACILITY BUT ARE NOW ONLY USED TO EMPOWER THE WATER. AND HOLDING THE WATER BEHIND THE DAM HAS THE POTENTIAL TO IMPACT DOWNSTREAM FISH POPULATIONS AND- ON FEBRUARY OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN WATER OUR AUDITOR CALIFORNIA ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF OUR COMPLIANCE WITH SECTION FIFTY NINE THIRTY SEVEN FISHING GAME CODE. RELATIVE TO THE EMPOWERMENT OF THE WATER BEHIND PSH. NAPA'S LAKE MURRAY AND LIKE KAMALA DAMS AND TO COMPLY WITH THAT THIS PARTICULAR. REGULATION DSA TWENTY TO COMPLETE ONGOING STREAM ASSESSMENTS AND MODIFY THE OPERATIONS OF THE LAKE MURRAY DAM. A NUMBER OF ACTIONS ARE ANTICIPATED TO KEEP BE CARRIED OUT BY THE DEPARTMENT TO COMPLY WITH THIS CODE SECTION.

THE FLOW RELEASE AND MONITORING PROGRAM- THE NECESSARY RESOURCE REQUESTING THIS PROPOSAL WOULD BE SPECIFIC TO ADDRESSING THE IMPLEMENTATION MONITORING THE FLOW OF THE FLOW RELEASE PROGRAM IDEA STAGE TAMPA. ADMITTED TAKE ANY QUESTIONS ON THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I WAS VERY SURPRISED TO KNOW THAT WE HAD RESERVOIRS ON OUR STATE HOSPITALS. ECONOMIC AND WE EVALUATED THE POSSIBILITY WE LOOK AT TEXAS STATE GROUND OF. SELLING PART OF THAT IF IT'S NO LONGER USED AS A WATER SOURCE FOR THE HOSPITAL WHY DO WE HOLD ON TO THAT GROUND AND- AND SPEND MORE MONEY FOR WATER QUALITY. THERE ARE- POTENTIAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR EVALUATING THE PROPERTY WHICH WE ARE UNDERGOING AN INFRASTRUCTURE MASTER PLAN SO I THINK THAT'S- SOMETHING WE'RE LOOKING AT BUT DON'T HAVE ANY SPECIFICS ON A STATUS OF THE CELL OF THE PROPERTY AT THIS MOMENT BUT WE'LL CERTAINLY TAKE NOTE OF THAT MADAM CHAIR. CAN YOU TELL ME THE FULL ACREAGE OF NAPA STATE HOSPITAL PROPERTY. I DON'T KNOW THAT OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD AND WE DO HAVE OUR ACTING CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER ROBERT HORSLEY IS ON THE LINE IF HALF THAT DETAIL AVAILABLE PLEASE FEEL FREE TO SHARE IF NOT WE CAN CERTAINLY FOLLOW UP. MISTER GORE THAT THERE'S APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED TWENTY ACRES AT NAPA TWO HUNDRED TWENTY ACRES IN NAPA AND HOW MUCH- GROUND IS THE HOSPITAL TAKE UP IN PARKING. I'M NOT SURE WE KNOW THAT NOT INSURANCE SO I THINK WE MAY BE ABLE TO TAKE A- LOOK AT HOW MANY ACREAGES UTILIZED FOR A HOSPITAL SPECIFIC OPERATIONS AND WHAT. MAY NOT BE MAXIMIZED IN AND CAN REPORT BACK TO YOUR STAFF ON THAT. THAT WOULD BE GREAT AND THEN MAYBE DO FOR THE REST OF THE HOSPITALS TO I MEAN. AS WE LOOK AT X. AS WE LOOK AT THE- NEED FOR HOUSING AS WE LOOK AT THE NEED FOR A LAND FOR HOUSING. IT IT'S JUST INTERESTING TO THINK OF SOME OF OUR STATE HOSPITALS OR A BIG PIECES OF LAND AND WE'RE NOT USING ALL OF THAT. PERHAPS I COULD BE SOMETHING THAT WE CAN CONSIDER. BUT PRINT. I WOULD TO TOSSES. IS THAT- AND THIS IS INTERESTING BECAUSE WE HAVE SEVERAL ITEMS I CALL THIS THE LANDLORD PART. OF THE- IN THE HEARING- AND I KNOW THAT THE VARSITY HOSPITALS AND- CERTAINLY AS OVERSEE ELASTICITIES AND PROPERTY. IF THIS ISN'T NECESSARY FOR THE FUNCTION THE HOSPITAL MORE WHETHER IT'S SELLING IT FOR OTHER PURPOSES ALL OR IS THERE ANOTHER AGENCY IN THE STATE. THAT MIGHT HAVE THE EXPERTISE. SO SIGNALED THE- TO RETURN OPERATE THAT PROPERTY IF FOR SOME REASON THE STATE WHAT'S THE CONTINUE POSSESSION- CERTAINLY AGAIN THE PARTY HOSPITALS A LOT OF EXPERTISE BUT I THINK WE WANT TO KEEP YOU FOCUSED ON THE CARE OF PATIENTS AND THEN OF COURSE THE FACILITIES THAT THEY RESIDE IN. BUT THE FACT THAT WE'RE NOW HAVING TO GET ENGINEERS TO SENSUALLY OPERATE RESERVOIRS- HERE WHAT THEIR DAD IS BETTER PLACED IN AN AGENCY THAT'S USED TO. HANDLING WATER NOT THAT YOU CAN'T DO IT BUT I THINK THERE'S CERTAIN YOU KNOW CERTAIN EXPERTISE. MAYBE AND OTHER AGENCIES THAT MAY BE MORE RELEVANCE- THAT AND TO MAKE IT MORE EFFICIENT TO DO IT THAT WAY. THANK YOU.
