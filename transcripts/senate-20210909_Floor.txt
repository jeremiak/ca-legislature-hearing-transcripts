SENATOR HERTZBERG IS PREPARED MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE READ SENATE BILL SIX FORTY SIX BY SENATOR HERTZBERG AN ACT RELATING TO EMPLOYMENT CENTER HERTZBERG THE FLOOR'S YOURS. THINK ABOUT PRESIDENT THE JANITORIAL SERVICES IN THE INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA IS CURRENTLY DRIVEN BY. INTENSE COMPETITION BY CONTRACTS BY JANITORIAL SERVICE FIRMS IN THE PREVALENCE OF MULTIPLE CHAINS OF LOW ROAD SUBCONTRACTING LOW LABOR COSTS ARE THE PRIMARY GROUNDS IN WHICH LOW ROAD JANITORIAL CONTRACTORS COMPETE FOR BUSINESS NOT INNOVATION. OR PRODUCTIVITY. THESE LOW ROAD EMPLOYERS TYPICALLY PROVIDE LOWER WAGES AND FAIR WORKING CONDITIONS AND TOO OFTEN ENGAGING GREGIS WAGE AND EMPLOYMENT VIOLATIONS FOR JANITORIAL WORKERS. THIS MEASURE BEFORE THIS BODY TODAY SEEKS TO LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD FOR RESPONSIBLE CONTRACTORS AND THEIR WORKERS BY EXEMPTING JANITORIAL COMPLETES FROM PAGA IF THE EMPLOYEE WORK IS CONVERTED. BY VALID IS COVERED EXCUSE ME BY A VALID COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT- THIS TRANSFORMS THE INDUSTRY ELIMINATES EXPLOITATION ABUSE IT'S SUPPORTED BY FREDDIE MERCURY THE SINGER ON BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY AMONG OTHERS. I ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE. FOR ANY DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM. CENTER GROVE. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I RESPECTFULLY I AM DEEPLY RESPECT THE AUTHOR BUT RESPECTFULLY RISE IN OPPOSITION OF THIS BILL. YOU MIGHT WONDER WHY BECAUSE WE ALL KNOW THAT FOR THE LAST FEW YEARS I'VE JUST RAILED ON THE ABUSES OF PAGA. AND HOW TRIAL LAWYERS HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF A LOT OF EMPLOYERS IN THE STATE BECAUSE PAGA. HAS TWO FORMS OF PENALTY HAVE A LIABILITY PHASE AND A PENALTY PHASE. AND SO IF YOU'RE AN EMPLOYER AND YOU HAPPEN TO BANK AT WELLS FARGO IN YOU DON'T PUT THE PHYSICAL ADDRESS OF THE WELLS FARGO BANK THAT SHE BANK AT. THERE'S NO. YOU GO TO THE PENALTY PHASE WHICH IS NON WAIVER OF ALL THE JUDGE CAN'T PICK A SIDE IT'S AN AUTOMATIC TUNER FIFTY DOLLAR PENALTY PER PAY PERIOD PER EMPLOYEE. IF YOU HAVE A PERIOD A COMMA DASH OR SOMETHING ON YOUR PAYCHECK STUB. IT CREATES HAVOC- BECAUSE IF YOU ARE. I DON'T KNOW ABC COMPANY AND ON THE SECRETARY OF STATE'S FILING YOUR A. PERIOD BE PERIOD C. PERIOD COMPANY. THAT AGAIN CREATES ANOTHER VIOLATION. BUT THIS. MEMBERS WE FIND IT IS INTERESTING TO ME THAT YOU GUYS ARE CONSIDERING YOU MOST LIKELY WILL PASS A PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT EXEMPTS JANITORIAL COMPANIES- THAT MY COLLEAGUE- THE AUTHOR SAYS- FOLLOWS THE LAW. AFTER DOING SOME INVESTIGATION ON THIS UNTIL I FOUND OUT THAT THE ACTUAL COMPANIES SOMETIMES LANGUAGE BECAUSE OF THE BILLING YOU CAN IDENTIFY IF YOU DIG INTO IT LIKE A FEW YEARS AGO THERE WAS A BILL THAT EXCLUDED- CERTAIN COMPANIES FROM HAVING TO COMPLY WITH SOMETHING AS LONG AS THEY MERGED WITH ANOTHER COMPANY AND HAD SO MANY EMPLOYEES WITHIN. A STATE OR NATIONALLY AND THAT SHE JUST HAD A BIG FLASHING RED LIGHT ON IT THE CITY AT AND T. THIS BILL SHOULD HAVE A BIG FLASHING RED LIGHT ON IT THAT SAYS ABM. ABM IS A CONTRACTOR THAT WORKS FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT HAS THE LARGEST STATE CONTRACTING FOR JANITORIAL SERVICES THEY DO OTHER CONTACTS CONTRACTS THAT WE WERE ABLE TO FIND WORK ALL OVER. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA INCLUDING CLEANING- MOSTLY JANITORIAL CLEANING SERVICES THEY'RE REPRESENTED BY THE S. YEAH YOU I FEEL LIKE THE S. YEAH HE WAS MOVING IN A BETTER PLACE FOR THE NEW PRESIDENT MAY BE ABLE TO REPRESENT THESE EMPLOYEES. BUT I'M DOING SOME MORE DIGGING ON THIS PARTICULAR BILL AND THE CONTRACTORS THAT IT WILL PROTECT. LED ME TO THIS AND I'M NOT SURE. I MEAN I LIMITED I REALLY DIDN'T WANT TO BRING A DOLLY FULL OF BOXES INTO THE FLOOR HAS AN EXAMPLE SO ALL THEY DID WAS PRINT THE SUMMARIES. OF THE- CERTAIN ITEMS. SO THIS BILL WILL PROTECT A CONTRACTOR THAT HAS EIGHTY NINE. EIGHTY NINE THIS BILL IF IT PASSES WILL PROTECT THE CONTRACTOR THAT HAS EIGHTY NINE PAGA CASES FILED AGAINST IT. EIGHTY NINE CASES WHERE EMPLOYEES FEEL UNJUSTLY TREATED WAGING OUR FAILURE PARTICIPATE MEAL AND REST PERIODS REIMBURSE PERIODS FAILURE TO PROVIDE PRIVACY FOR JANITORIAL WOMENTO LACTATE IN PRIVATE. THINK ABOUT THAT ONE FOR A SECOND LET THAT ONE SETTLEMENT FAILURE TO PROVIDE AGAIN MILLIN REST PERIODS NO REIMBURSEMENT FOR EXPENSES MINIMUM WAGE NOT PAID REST MILL PRES VIOLATES OVERTIME RULES MY PAYSTUB MINIMUM WAGE IN A WORKER WAGE STATEMENTS WILL MEAL AND REST PERIODS AGAIN. I'M NOT ABLE TO TAKE A REST PERIOD DURING THE NIGHT NO RELIEF SUPERVISOR HARASSMENT PAYSTUB MINIMUM WAGE MILITARISTS PERIODS WAGING OVERTIME FAILURE TO SECURE EMPLOYEE FINANCIAL INFORMATION AND PROTECTED PRIVACY A PREGNANCY RETALIATION RE HOUSE HARASSMENT NEIL PERRY'S RESTAURANT I'M NOT GOING TO READ ALL EIGHTY NINETY YOU. AT PAPA WAS PUT IN PLACE TO PREVENT EMPLOYERS LIKE THIS FROM TAKING ADVANTAGE OF EMPLOYEES. PAGA IS A PROBLEM THERE ARE GOOD EMPLOYERS OUT THERE THAT JUST MISSED US ISSUES ON THEIR PAYCHECK STUBS AND THEY GET CAUGHT UP IN THIS FRIVOLOUS LITIGATION BY THESE TRIAL ATTORNEYS. BUT PASSING A BE A PIECE OF LEGISLATION AND THE VOTING I ON A BILL THAT PROTECTS A COMPANY THAT HAS EIGHTY NINE PAGA CASES FILED AGAINST IT. FOR A GRIEVOUS VIOLATIONS IS NUMBER ONE. HYPOCRITICAL BECAUSE- WHAT YOU DO IS YOU PASS LAWS ABOUT PROTECTING JANITORIAL GROUPS AND- YOU KNOW PROTECTING WOMEN ON THE SHIPS. FROM SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND YOU'RE NOW TAKING AWAY OF A WAY FOR THEM TO HAVE A MECHANISM AGAINST A BAD EMPLOYER- FLOOR. NUMBER TWO. A PARTY IS A REAL PROBLEM AND MAYBE ALL THESE CLAIMS ARE FALSE I HAVE NO IDEA DOESN'T SOUND LIKE IT WHEN YOU READ THE DOCUMENTS IN THE WITNESS STATEMENTS. AGAIN I DIDN'T BRING THOSE IN HERE. OR NUMBER THREE. WE JUST DON'T CARE ABOUT THESE EMPLOYEES THAT NEED THIS MECHANISM TO BE ABLE TO- FILE A CLAIM AGAINST THEIR EMPLOYER AND HAVE SOME TYPE OF THE GREEDY SYSTEM OUTSIDE A UNION CONTRACT THAT BINDS THEM TO ARBITRATION. WITH NO REMEDY AND SO OUT OF RESPECT FOR JANITORS ACROSS THE STATE I ASKED FOR A NO VOTE. SENATOR DOLLY. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS. I ALSO RISE IN OPPOSITION BAND I WANT TO SHARE THAT. IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WE HAD. A. B. SIXTEEN FIFTY FOUR WHICH WAS A RUBIO BILL THEY DID THE EXACT SAME THING THAT THIS BILLS ARE PRETTY CLOSE TO WHAT THIS BILL IS DOING. AND I WAS ONE OF THE ONLY REPUBLICANS THAT VOTED FOR. BECAUSE I THINK THAT PARKER HAS A HUGE AMOUNT OF. W. CIS. MANY COMPANIES THAT ARE TRYING TO DO THE RIGHT THING GET. FINED AND SUED BECAUSE OF PARKING VIOLATIONS. AND NOW WE'RE DOING ONE OFFS THIS IS THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT THE SENATOR FROM BAKERSFIELD SAID THIS IS EXEMPTING. UNIONIZED COMPANIES WHO ARE BAD ACTORS IF YOU VOTE FOR THIS BILL YOU'RE EXEMPTING. COMPANIES THAT ARE BAD ACTORS. YOU KNOW. WE HEAR ABOUT WE HEARD YESTERDAY FROM. FROM THE SENATOR FROM SANTA MONICA THAT WE DON'T LIKE TO BE WE DON'T LIKE TO BE PARTISAN WE DON'T TALK ABOUT HOW. SUPPOSEDLY REPUBLICANS HELP BUSINESS OUT. THIS BILL RIGHT HERE IS EXACTLY WHAT THE SENATOR WAS TALKING ABOUT IF YOU VOTE FOR THIS BILL YOU'RE HELPING EXEMPT A COMPANY THAT HAS BEEN BAD. HOW'S THAT GOING TO HELP THE WORKER. SO I STAND WITH THE CENTER FROM BAKERSFIELD I ACTUALLY VOTED FOR THESE EXEMPTIONS BECAUSE I THINK WE NEED TO FIX PAGA. NOT ALLOW IT TO BE A TOOL. TO BE MANIPULATED BY THIS LEGISLATOR SO THAT COMPANIES GOOD OR BAD CAN GET INTO A WAIVER THAT'S WRONG. WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO THE RIGHT THING THE RIGHT THING IS A DRESS. THE PAGA. INCONSISTENCIES THIS BILL WILL NOT HELP THIS THIS BILLS GET IS THE MOTHER MAY I. SYSTEM RUNNER IF YOU GOT THE- LEGISLATURE'S RIGHT TO GET INTO IT EXEMPTION YOU GET ONE. IF YOU DON'T WE'RE GOING TO PENALIZE YOU. THAT'S WRONG BUT NO DO THE RIGHT THING. CENTERED ON. YEAH I'VE GOT A PRESIDENT I TAKE A DIFFERENT VIEW OF THIS I DON'T DISAGREE THAT THERE ARE ABUSES WITH PAPA I TRY TO POP THE REFORM BILL THIS YEAR I COULD NOT GET TO FIRST BASE. AND I WASN'T TALKING ABOUT ANY BIG THING I WAS TALKING ABOUT A PAYSTUB VIOLATIONS. SO LOOK IT. IN THIS HOUSE IN THE OTHER HOUSE WE'RE NOT GOING TO GET WIDESPREAD. BREAKS FROM POP POP WE'VE GOT TO DO IT INCREMENTALLY. YOU OUGHT TO JUST SAY THAT. TO SAY THAT WORDS WERE- IF WE VOTE FOR THIS. THAT WE ARE- YOU KNOW IT JUST AUTOMATICALLY HELPING BAD ACTORS I THINK MISSES THE POINT I'M GONNA VOTE FOR THIS BILL TODAY BECAUSE I WANT TO START DOING SOME MORE INCREMENTAL WHAT OFF THINGS THAT HELP OUR EMPLOYERS WHO ARE GETTING BEATEN UP EVERY SINGLE DAY BYE PADA ADD SOME CASES. THEY'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT IN THOSE EMPLOYERS NED TO BE BEATEN UP BUT IN MANY CASES PARTICULARLY IN MY DISTRICT WHERE PEOPLE COME TO ME IT'S JUST ABSOLUTELY UNBELIEVABLE EXPECT WE ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS. ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION AND DEBATE. SINGMAN SENATOR HERTZBERG YOU MAKE INCLUDE. THANK YOU MEMBERS AND- I APPRECIATE THE ROBUST NATURE OF THIS DEBATE AND I'M REMINDED- BY MY DAD USED TO ALWAYS COLD FLATTEN. IT BASICALLY SAYING WHEN THE REASON FOR THE RULE SEIZES THE ROLE CEASES. IN NINETEEN NINETY FIVE SENATOR DONE PAST. BOB HARGA. IN THE UNDERLYING FRAMEWORK BRIEFLY OF EMPLOYMENT LAW IS WHEN SOMEONE DOESN'T HAVE THE PROTECTION H. TWO OF A LARGER GROUP THERE'S A DESPERATE BARGAINING POWER AND SO WHETHER THOSE CLAIMS WERE MADE BY ONE COMPANY OR ANOTHER COMPANY CERTAINLY DOES EXIST BUT THE SOLUTION HERE IS TO BALANCE OUT THE DISPARATE BARGAINING POWER SO THAT THERE CAN BE A CONTRACT WITH RESPECT TO THOSE POINTS THAT WERE RAISED BY THE CENTER OF BAKERSFIELD THAT WILL IN FACT PROTECT THE WORKERS AND THAT IN FACT SINCE YOU DON'T HAVE THE COLLECTIVE TO SUPPORT THIS IMBALANCE OF POWER. THAT'S WHY YOU NEED PAGA AND WHEN YOU HAVE THE COLLECTIVE PARTICULARLY INDUSTRY THE BERKELEY TALKS ABOUT HIS REPORT THE RACE TO THE BOTTOM YOU HAVE A PARTICULAR UNIQUE GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS THAT NEED THAT LEVEL OF PROTECTION AND SO THIS IS A- BARGAIN IF YOU WILL THIS IS SOMETHING. THAT IS AS- THE CENTER FROM NAPA INDICATED OKAY INCREMENTALISM BUT IT'S A BIG STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND IT IS INFORMED BY THE UNDERLYING ARCHITECTURE OF THE DISPUTE OUR BETWEEN THE INDIVIDUAL AND THE GROUP. AND SO I THINK IT IS THOUGHTFUL I THINK THAT IS CERTAINLY THERE WILL BE A BUNCH OF COMPANIES THAT WILL MAKE THE DETERMINATION TO AVOID PROGRESS. WITHIN ORGANIZED ON THE OTHER HAND AND THAT'S A GOOD THING AND SO WITH THAT MEMBERS. I'D ASK YOU TO VOTE ON THIS MEASURE THANK. ADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. ALAN ARCHULETA I.

SENATE BILL THIRTY FIVE BY SENATOR UMBERG AN ACT RELATING TO ELECTIONS SENATOR UMBERG THE FLOOR IS YOURS THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT POLITICS OF THE RITUAL IS B. THIRTY FIVE. WAS INTENDED TO CLEAN UP SOME OF THE GLITCHES IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ELECTION- WHAT THIS DOES THE AMENDMENTS IN THE ASSEMBLY SIMPLY ALIGN THE- REQUIREMENTS TO SUBMIT TAX RETURNS FOR GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATES WITH OTHER DEADLINES AND TIMELINES AND PROVIDE A CURE. IF IT'S NOT A DREAM TO BE ADEQUATE ORIGINAL VOTE. IS THERE ANY DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM. ANY DISCUSSION OR DEBATE SENATOR BATES. QUESTION FOR THE DOCTOR SENIOR MEMBER GROUP WILL YOU TAKE A QUESTION THANK YOU SATURDAYS SO. I'M CONCERNED ABOUT A PROVISION IN THE HARBOR THAT SAYS THAT THE- THE REDACTED TAX RETURNS ARE LEFT TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE TO DETERMINE IF THEY NEED SATISFACTION AND I AM NOT AWARE THAT THERE'S ANY STANDARD THAT HAS BEEN PRODUCED SINCE THERE WAS A DEBATE OVER THE US EARLIER THIS YEAR IN ANOTHER ELECTION. IF THERE IN FACT A STANDARD THAT IS GIVEN TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE- CREATED ALTHOUGH THAT IS NOT ARBITRARY ON EACH AND EVERY I'LL RETURN. THERE IS NOT A STANDARD THAT'S BEEN CODIFIED IN THE LAW- THE LAW WOULD APPLY A REASONABLENESS STANDARD SO FOR EXAMPLE IF SOMEONE REJECTS THEIR SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER THAT WOULD BE PERFECTLY APPROPRIATE. THE SUMMER THE DAX THERE YOU KNOW INCOME THAT WOULD NOT BE APPROPRIATE AND SO IT IS LEFT TO THE SECTOR'S STATE AND SHOULD THE SECTORS STATE BE ARBITRARY AND CAPRICIOUS. THEN OF COURSE THEN ONE HAS RECOURSE TO THE COURTS. ON MY OWN TIME THEN- MEMBERS WE'VE HAD SOME PRETTY SPIRITED DEBATES IN HERE ABOUT ELECTION INTEGRITY. AND WHEN WE LEAVE THINGS TO SOMEONE INDIVIDUALS DISCRETION- AND IT IS A PARTISAN. POSITION WHICH I BELIEVE SHOULD BE CHANGED THAT RAISES THE IRE OF THOSE WHO DO NOT AGREE OR BELIEVE THAT IT WAS SO ARBITRARY AND IT HAD A POLITICAL AGENDA OR MOTIVATION. SO I WOULD RECOMMEND ON. OUR BILLS LIKE THIS THAT WE TAKE A REALLY CLOSE LOOK. AT THE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE MAKING THE LAWS THAT WE ARE. MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS NOT AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THAT PARTICULAR INDIVIDUAL WHO WILL NOT HAVE THAT OFFICER EVER. HAVE SOME STANDARDS BY WHICH THEY OPERATE IN IS NOT LEFT TO THEIR DISCRETION BECAUSE WE'VE TALKED ABOUT IMPLICIT BIAS THOSE ARE THE THINGS THAT UNFORTUNATELY HAVE INVADED OUR ELECTION SYSTEM AND THE INTEGRITY. AND THE TRUST OF THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA HAVE AN R. LECTION SYSTEM SO WITH THAT I DO NOT INTEND TO SUPPORT THIS BECAUSE OF THAT. BUT I DO APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S ATTEMPTS TO CLEAN UP SOME OF THE PROBLEMS THAT WE HAVE HAD THAT MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE. THANK YOU. IS THERE ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. SINGMAN CENTER AMBER YOU MAY CONCLUDE FIVE THANK YOU MATTER PRESENT WITHOUT GETTING TOO FAR INTO THE WOODS WANT TO RESPOND THAT IN MANY AREAS THE LAW PROVIDES THE REASONABLENESS STANDARD- THAT IS APPLIED IN IMPLIED HERE AND AGAIN SHOULD THE SECRETARY OF STATE- BE UNREASONABLE. IN THEIR- REJECTION OF A TAX RETURN BECAUSE OF EXCESSIVE REDACTIONS AGAIN THE THAT PERSON HAS- ACCESS AND RECOURSE TO THE COURTS VIRGIN I VOTE. MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL.

NO LONGER A POSTCARD THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION SAN DIEGO DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE THE SAN DIEGO DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S ASSOCIATION AND OUR PEACE OFFICERS RESEARCH ASSOCIATION PORAC THE AMENDMENTS REMOVED THE PRESUMPTION STANDARD.

JUST AS MALONE ROUGE CELEBRATES TRUTH BEAUTY FREEDOM AND LOVE THIS BILL WILL DO THE SAME AS THE GUARDS ARE COURTS IN APPLYING SENTENCE ENHANCEMENTS I ASK FOR YOUR I. VOTE. SENATOR NIELSEN. MADAM PRESIDENT LAYS DOWN ON THE SENATE. A LITTLE BIT OF HISTORY HERE. SHE DIDN'T HAVE CEMENT CAME ALONG AS A RESPONSE TO SOMETHING THAT PASSED IN. NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN CALL THE DETERMINANT SENTENCE LAW. EVEN GOVERNOR BROWN LIVED TO RUE THE DAY THAT THAT PACKS. DETERMINATE SENTENCE LONGER SUPPORTED BY BOTH CONSERVATIVES AND LIBERALS FOR VERY DIFFERENT REASONS AT ALL. LIVE TO RUE THE DAY. THE CONSERVATIVES WANTED TO MAKE SURE BECAUSE OF THE LEAK LEAK SENTENCING OF THOSE ERRORS THE INDIVIDUALS WOULD BSOLUTELY SERVE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME TO BE PUNCHED. LIBERALS ELECTED BECAUSE NOBODY KNEW HOW LONG THEY WERE GONNA SERVE INDETERMINATE SENTENCE. WITH ASSURE THEM OF THAT. SO AS A PART OF THE CORRECTION OVER THE YEARS. AND AS A PART OF THE RESPONSE TO THE SEVERITY OF THE CRIME WAVES THAT ARE REFLECTED OUR SOCIETY AND OUR CITIZENS. ENHANCEMENTS OF COLOGNE. WELL THE REFORMERS HAVE NEVER LIKED ENHANCEMENT. SOME OF EVEN CALL IT A DOUBLE PENALTY. LOOK ENHANCEMENTS ARE THE PRODUCT OF CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR THAT WAS MORE EGREGIOUS AND THEREFORE REQUIRED AND JUSTIFIED A LONGER SENTENCE FOR THAT INDIVIDUAL'S BEHAVIOR. THIS IS JUST ANOTHER PART OF THE LET'S GO EASY ON CRIME- SUFFERS. DO YOU EVER THINK ABOUT VICTIMS AROUND HERE HARDLY EVER ANYMORE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN THE VICTIMS ARE THE CRIMINALS AND THEIR FAMILIES. THE VICTIMS ARE NOT. THE REAL TRUE VICTIMS. THE PART OF A REFORM EFFORT WE JUST LOST A SIXTY ONE YEAR OLD WOMAN. IN SOUTH SACRAMENTO. TO A LOVELY YOUNG MAN. WHO WAS GIVEN A LOT OF LOVE. SEARCH NECK. INSTEAD OF BEING. BUT HE WAS BAILED OUT pPHIL HE HIT THE STREETS. THE SIXTY ONE YEAR OLD WOMAN. AND OUR TWO DOGS ARE DEAD BECAUSE OF IT. MY POINT IS THERE ARE CONSEQUENCES AND CONSEQUENCES IN PART OR SENTENCE ENHANCEMENTS. AND HERE WE'RE GOING TO GIVE GREAT WEIGHT ALL WE'RE GONNA LET THE JUDGES DECIDE. AND MAYBE THE PRESUMPTION LANGUAGE. HAS BEEN LESSENED SLIGHTLY. BUT CLEARLY THE PRESENT JOB REPORT THE PRODUCTION IS THERE AND IF THIS IS ALLOWED TO PASS. YOUR TD THAT PRESUMPTION IS GOING TO BE BACK AGAIN NEXT YEAR TO MAKE IT EVEN MORE FIRM AND EVEN MORE OBLIGING. THE JUDGE AND THE JUSTICE SYSTEM. THE PERSON THAT. REALLY WHAT THAT THAT CRIME WOULD MAKE NO DIFFERENCE. I'M SORRY LADIES AND GENTLEMAN. BUT I DID GET A LITTLE BIT UPSET. BECAUSE I'M SEEING FAR TOO MANY TERRIBLE THINGS HAPPENING IN OUR COMMUNITIES ACROSS AMERICA. UNTIL WE AMERICANS STAND UP AND SAY NO MAS. IT'S GOING TO GET ONLY WORSE. CENTER GROVE. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I RISE IN OPPOSITION OF SPD ONE- NO SENTENCE ENHANCEMENTS S. B. EIGHTY ONE WOULD REQUIRE A JUDGE TO STRIKE SINCE ENHANCEMENTS UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES ALL WHICH WILL RESULT IN VERY VERY VERY BAD PEOPLE BEING RELEASED FROM PRISON EARLIER THAN THEY DESERVE. MY COLLEAGUES WHO WROTE THE- WHO VOTE FOR THIS BILL I WONDER IF YOU HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO. READ THE SACRAMENTO BEE LAST WEEK WHICH MY COLLEAGUE FROM AMY JUST REFERENCED. A MAN NAMED TIMOTHY DINNERS TROY DAVIS A MAN NAMED TROY DAVIS A FIFTY ONE YEAR OLD TRANSIENT WITH A CRIMINAL HISTORY THAT INCLUDES TWO FELONY STRIKE CONVICTIONS. OF ASSAULT WITH A DEADLY WEAPON AND ROBBERY WAS RELEASED FROM JAIL ON HIS OWN RECORD COGNEX IS. IN JUNE AFTER HIS ARREST IN AN AUTO THEFT CASE THEY WERE ONLY ABLE TO HOLD HIM. I CAN TELL YOU THAT MR DAVIS WHO HAS A RICH CRIMINAL HISTORY IN SACRAMENTO BEE DATING BACK TO TWO THOUSAND AND THIRTEEN. INCLUDING CHARGES OF RESISTING AN OFFICER BATTERY ON AN OFFICER POSSESSING MASS THREATENING AN OFFICER. MISDEMEANOR SEXUAL BATTERY AND ASSAULT AND BATTERY. EARLIER THIS LAST WEEK HE WAS APPARENTLY CAUGHT AT A RING DOORBELL **** N LAND PARK. THEN ON FRIDAY LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS EVIDENCE AND HAS BELIEVES THAT THIS EVIL MAN BROKE INTO THE HOME OF MARY TIBBETTS. HE KILLED THEIR DOGS BY MUTILATING THEM HE RAPED AND MURDERED HER ANY BURN YOUR HOUSE DOWN. THIS PERSON SHOULD NEVER BEEN LET OUT OF JAIL. A SWEET SIXTY ONE YEAR OD WOMAN IS DEAD BECAUSE THIS CRIMINAL BENEFITED FROM THE POLICIES IMPLEMENTED BY THIS LEGISLATURE AND A GOVERNOR THAT LETS DANGEROUS PEOPLE BACK OUT INTO OUR STREETS. IF CONVICTED MR DAVIS COULD GET THE DEATH PENALTY. EXCEPT THAT THAT WOULD BE MEANINGLESS BECAUSE WE SUSPENDED THE DEATH PENALTY BY THE LEADERSHIP IN THE STATE. SINCE ENHANCEMENTS RECOGNIZES SOME CRIMINALS ARE A VERY UNIQUE THREAT TO PUBLIC SAFETY. AND THAT BY NO MEANS WHICH THEY COMMIT THEIR CRIMES AND THEY DESERVE ADDITIONAL PUNISHMENT. SP EIGHTY ONE CENTS AN ADDITIONAL MESSAGE THAT WE'RE NO LONGER SERIOUS ABOUT PROTECTING OUR PUBLIC AND OUR COMMUNITIES. A LOT OF MONEY HASN'T BEEN BEEN INVESTED IN- LIKE MY COLLEAGUE FROM TO HEMA SAID LEVYING OF THESE PRISONERS. IN OFFERING THEM CHOICES THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE LIKE MR DAVIS THAT- I HATE TO SAY IT BUT NO MATTER WHAT WE OFFER THEM THEY'RE GONNA COMMIT CRIMES. AND SENTENCING HANS HANS SMITS HELP KEEP PEOPLE LIKE MR DAVIS BEHIND JAIL IN JAIL AND BEHIND BARS. AND SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A NO VOTE BECAUSE THE CITIZENS THAT WE REPRESENT IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DESERVE TO BE SAFE IN THE COMMUNITY THAT THEY WALK IN AND THEY DESERVE TO BE SAFE DEFINITELY IN THEIR OWN HOMES I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A NO VOTE. SENATOR WIENER. I THANK YOU- YOU KNOW WHENEVER WE DEBATE- CRIME AND PUNISHMENT IN PUBLIC SAFETY- WE THEY'RE ALWAYS SO IT'S HORRIFIC NIGHTMARE EXAMPLES OF PEOPLE WHO COMMIT TERRIBLE CRIMES THAT PEOPLE COMMIT TERRIBLE CRIMES NEED TO BE HELD CIVILLY ACCOUNTABLE FOR THOSE CRIMES BUT WHEN WE LOOK AT HOW WE DO SENTENCING IN CALIFORNIA. INCLUDING OUR ADDICTION TO OUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY CENTS ANNOUNCEMENTS. A SIGNIFICANT MAJORITY NIGHTMARE SCENARIO THERE ARE PROBABLY DOZENS OF SCENARIOS OR SCORES OR HUNDREDS OF SCENARIOS WHERE PEOPLE WHO HAVE COMMITTED CRIMES AND NEED TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. BUT ARE NOT IN THAT NIGHTMARE SCENARIO AT ALL AND YOU CAN BE REHABILITATED. THEY HAVE A CERTAIN SETS TURN FROM TWO OR THREE YEARS AND A TEN OR FIFTEEN OR TWENTY YEARS BECAUSE OF THE PILING ON OF SENSE ENHANCEMENTS SO INSTEAD OF JUST SAYING THIS CRIME IS PUNISHABLE BY THIS AMOUNT OF TIMES. WE PILE IT ON AND THEIR LIVES ARE DESTROYED ANY CHANCE OF REHABILITATING THEM AND BRING THEM BACK INTO THE COMMUNITY AND REUNITING THEM WITH THEIR FAMILIES IS ENDED. AND WE ALSO KNOW WHO IS IMPACTED DISPROPORTIONATELY. BY THE SONS AND HUSBANDS IT'S NOT PEOPLE WHO LOOK LIKE ME LET'S JUST PUT IT THAT WAY. BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN TORN APART BECAUSE OF OUR ADDICTION TO MASS INCARCERATION IN CALIFORNIA WHEN YOU TAKE A MORE RATIONAL APPROACH GIVES JUDGES THE TOOLS THEY NEED. TO ACTUALLY EVALUATE THE FACTS OF CASES AND TO APPLY SENSE IT HASN'T ONLY WHEN APPROPRIATE I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN IPO. OR ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM. ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE SAYING NINE CENTER SKINNER YOU MAY CONCLUDE. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT SO I JUST WANT TO CORRECT THE RECORD. **** ONE DOES NOT ELIMINATE ANY SENTENCE ENHANCEMENT NOR DOES IT REQUIRE OR FORCE A JUDGE TO DISMISS AN ENHANCEMENT. AND THE PRESUMPTION LANGUAGE IT IS FULLY AND ENTIRELY REMOVED INSTEAD THE BILL. GIVES THE JUDGE THE ABILITY TO. CONSIDER WITH GREAT WEIGHT SPECIFIED CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH ARE DEFINED IN THOSE AMENDMENTS DEMANDED OF GREAT WEIGHT AND THE REMOVAL OF PRESUMPTION THE DEFINITION OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND THE FACT THAT THE THIS BILL CANNOT BE APPLIED RETROACTIVELY WERE ALL NEGOTIATED WITH THE FOLKS WHO I MENTIONED HAVE NOW REMOVED THEIR OPPOSITION WHICH IS THE- DEPARTMENT THE CALIFORNIA DA'S ASSOCIATION AND PORK SO WITH THAT.

SENATE pSENATOR ALAN AN ACT RELATING TO ENVIRONMENTAL ADVERTISING. SENATOR ALLEN THE FLOOR'S YOURS THIRTY MINUTE PRESENT SOMETIMES I FEEL LIKE THE MAN OF LA MANCHA. TILTING AT WINDMILLS ON THIS ISSUE RELATING TO PLASTICS- WE'VE UNFORTUNATELY NOT YET GOTTEN OUR- SP FIFTY FOUR ACROSS THE FINISH LINE YEAH BUT WE DID MAKE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS YESTERDAY WITH THE ASSEMBLY'S PASSAGE OF. SB THREE FORTY THREE WHICH IS OUR TRUTH IN LABELING GULF RECYCLING- MEMBERS CURRENT LAW SAYS THAT IF YOU CAN'T YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO PUT ON TRUTHFUL ENVIRONMENTAL- CLAIMS SUCH AS- EARTH FRIENDLY A RECYCLABLE ON AN ITEM IF YOU CAN'T. WRITE THE FACT THE RECYCLABLE ON YOUR RIGHT AND YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO PUT THE RECYCLING SYMBOL- ON ON YOUR ITEM SO THIS. EXTENDS THIS PROHIBITION TO THE USE OF THE CHASING ARROW SYMBOL SO THAT IF A PRODUCT OR PACKAGING IS NOT TRULY RECYCLABLE THEY CAN'T PUT THE CHEESE IN YOUR SYMBOL THERE. THE RECYCLING IS INCREDIBLY CONFUSING FOR PEOPLE PEOPLE ARE CONTINUALLY PUTTING ITEMS INTO THEIR BLUE BINS WITH RECYCLING SYMBOL ON THEM AND YET IT'S ACTUALLY MUDDYING THE WATERS IT'S CONTAMINATING THE SYSTEM IS MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT. FOR THE RECYCLING SYSTEM TO WORK PROPERLY WHEN THE REASONS WHY ALL THE MAJOR PLAYERS IN THE WASTE HAULERS. ARE CITIES IN CENTER ARE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THIS BILL. NOW I'M COUPLE WHAT ONE THING I JUST I NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT FOLKS UNDERSTAND QUESTIONS WERE RAISED ABOUT HOW THIS BILL HANDLES PLASTIC FILAMENT INTERACTS WITH ARE ARE SINGLE USE- BAG BAN REUSABLE PLASTIC BAG LAWS LET ME BE REALLY CLEAR THIS BILL DOES NOT SHUT DOWN VOLUNTARY STORE TAKE BACK PROGRAMS IT DOESN'T PREVENT BECAUSE CONSUMERS FROM RETURNING PLASTIC BAGS WERE STORED DROP OFF IS AVAILABLE BUT MUCH MORE NEES TO BE DONE TO IMPROVE PLASTIC FILM COLLECTION AND I AM COMMITTED TO LEADING AND WORKING WITH. THE FILM- SECTOR TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF FILM COLLECTED AND RECYCLED. SO WITH THAT- THIS IS ULTIMATELY A TRUTH IN ADVERTISING BILL- IT WILL ENSURE THAT- THAT THEY WILL END CONSUMER CONFUSION ABOUT WHAT IS RECYCLABLE IMPROVE RECYCLING EFFICIENCY REDUCE CONTAMINATION AND ULTIMATELY COSTS. FOR OUR RATEPAYERS. AND WITHOUT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A VOTE THERE ANY DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. ANY DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. SENATOR GLACIER THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS JUST BRIEFLY I WANT TO COMMEND- THE AUTHOR OF AD FOR HIS LEADERSHIP AND PERSISTENCE IN THIS SPACE- YEAH IT IS.

EIGHTY ONE THIRTY AND EIGHTY THREE TWENTY THIS BILL HAS RECEIVED BIPARTISAN SUPPORT AND HAS NO NOBLE I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR IPHONE THANK YOU. IS THERE ANY DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM. SENATOR NIELSEN. THE QUESTION FOR THE AUTHOR IF I MAY SENATOR RUBIO YOU ACCEPT QUESTION. AND SHE WILL THE SEARCH THEM MEANING THERE'S A SECOND PART OF THIS THAT WOULD GET RID OF THE RVCA READING INSTRUCTION COMPETENCE THAT THAT TEST WILL NO LONGER BE. NECESSARY TO BE ASSED BY TEACHERS POST TWENTY TWENTY FIVE IS THAT CORRECT. CURRENTLY WE'RE WORKING ON THE REPLACEMENT SO IT'S NOT GOING TO GO AWAY THERE'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE A TEST UNTIL- THE COMMISSION IS ABLE TO CREATE ONE THAT'S MORE UP TO DATE THE REASON THIS CAME ABOUT IS THAT WE'VE TRANSITIONED FROM. WHAT WE USED TO BE THE CALIFORNIA STATE STANDARDS TO NOW A COMMON CORE WHICH IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT- HOW WE DO THINGS IN THE CLASSROOM SOLD A NEW UPDATED VERSION WILL SATISFY THE CHANGES IN THE CURRICULUM AN ADVIL PM. AND PLEASE SO AGAIN THE TEST DOES NOT GO AWAY UNTIL THE NEW ONE IS CREATED SO THERE WILL BE NO CAP AND WHAT TEACHERS HAVE TO LEARN IMPROVE THEIR COMPETENCY WITH. WELL I I'M NOT GOING TO OBJECT TO THE- SEPARATELY BUT I'M- GONNA LAY OFF OF THIS VOTE. MY CONCERN IS WE HAVE THE WORST MATH AND READING SCORES IN AMERICA. IN CALIFORNIA.AND ANYTHING WE DO THAT WOULD DIMINISH. OUR TEACHERS FROM BEING ABLE TO BE THE HIGHEST. COMPETENCY THAT COULD BE THAT I DON'T LIKE THAT NOW I'M NOT SAYING THAT THIS BILL ACHIEVES THAT BUT LET'S JUST SAY I'M WORRIED. IT UP EITHER IT IS THERE ANY OTHER BAD DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM. CNN SENATOR RUBIO YOU MAY CONCLUDE. THANK YOU AND I JUST WANTED TO SHARE THAT I AGREE WITH WHAT YOU JUST STATED AND I THINK THAT WE NEED TO TRANSITION AWAY THAT TEACHERS ACTUALLY HAVE REAL LIFE EXPERIENCE IN THE CLASSROOM ARE ABLE TO REALLY BE IN A CLASSROOM SETTING WITH REAL LIFE STUDENTS AND ALSO HAVE MENTORSHIP OPPORTUNITIES. I WAS THERE ONCE AND I KNOW THAT JUST MEMORIZING THE TESTS ARE LEARNING A TEST FROM THE BOOKS DOESN'T ALWAYS HELP AND I ALWAYS TELL THIS STORY I HAD A TEACHER WHO WORK WITH US FOR SIX MONTHS AFTER SPENDING FOUR YEARS AT GETTING HER DEGREE AND GOING THROUGH ALL HER EDUCATION TO GET HER CREDENTIALS IT TOOK SIX MONTHS FOR HER TO REALIZE IT WASN'T FOR HER. AND THE WAY WE'RE TRANSITIONING THE TEST IS TO ALLOW TEACHERS TO ACTUALLY STEP FOOT IN A CLASSROOM WORK WITH STUDENTS HALF MENTOR TEACHERS HELP ON AND THEN DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT IT IS FOR THEM BECAUSE WE WANT COMPETENT TEACHERS THAT WANT TO BE IN THE CLASSROOM WITH THAT. I ASKED FOR IT I THANK YOU. MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. ALAN I ARCHULETA HI ATKINS I FACE I BACKER I FORGES I BRADFORD I HAVE ITEM HI PROTECTING. HI DALLY HI TODD.

SENATOR HERTZBERG FORGERS THANK YOU SO MUCH. CALIFORNIA IS EXPERIENCING THE WORST DROUGHT ON RECORD FROM TWO THOUSAND TWELVE TO TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN ESTIMATED TO BE THE DRIEST FOUR YEAR PERIOD IN THE LAST FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS I DON'T SPEND A LOT OF TIME BUT THIS IS A BIG DEAL IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT. AND SO MORE THAN 75% OF THE DROUGHT IMPACTED PUBLIC WATER SYSTEMS WERE SMALL SERVING A THOUSAND CONNECTIONS OR FEWER I COME FROM LOS ANGELES WHERE I HAVE A THOUSAND CONNECTIONS AND A FEW BLOCKS OF MY OF MY HOME. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT ALL OF US WHETHER WE COME FROM AN URBAN AREA OR RURAL AREA NEED TO DEAL WITH THAT DEALS WITH EQUITY AND JUSTICE IN CALIFORNIA ON SOMETHING THAT'S SO FUNDAMENTALLY IMPORTANT. FOR THIS MEASURE ENHANCES THIS DROUGHT PLANNING FOR THESE AREAS AND ALL I CAN SAY IS THAT THE NUMEROUS CO AUTHORS AND I WHEN WE COME TO THE CENTRAL VALLEY WE ARE MET WITH. ENTHUSIASM AND A SHOUT OF HERE COMES THE FANTASTIC SCIENCE REVIVAL. BUT IS THERE ANY DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THAT. ANY DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. SAYING THAT MEMBERS ARE SENATOR NIELSEN MY APOLOGY. MOUNT PLEASANT LANE DOWN THE CENTER I AM A LITTLE BIT WARY OF THIS BILL. AS ONE WHO REPRESENTS SO MANY SMALL JURISDICTIONS THE INTERFACE THESE PROBLEMS. WE UNDERSTAND WE HAVE A PROBLEM IN. A FORM WITH THE DROUGHT. WE LONG HAVE. BUT WE SQUANDER OPPORTUNITIES TO PROVIDE MORE WATER. THROUGH A BOND IT'S ALREADY BEEN PASSED SEVEN YEARS AGO TO BUILD LARGE SURFACE STORAGE. BUT WE CAN'T GET THAT DONE WHY ALL WE HAVE THESE LITTLE REVIEWS AND PERMITTING SORT OF IMPEDED THAT. THESE LITTLE JURISDICTIONS. THEY'RE IN TROUBLE. SOME OF US REPRESENT AREAS WHERE WE'RE HAVING TO HELP THEM FIND WATER TO BE HAULED OUT SIMPLY THAT THEY CAN HAVE SOMETHINGTO DRINK IT'S NOT EVEN ABOUT WASHING YOUR CLOTHES. YEAH WE DO HAVE A PROBLEM HERE. BUT I'M JUST A LITTLE BIT WARY. ABOUT HAVING MORE GOVERNMENT CONTROL NOW WHAT DO I MEAN BY THAT. WE ALREADY HAVE THE SUSTAINABLE GROUNDWATER MANAGEMENT LEGISLATION AND EACH COUNTY HAS TO HAVE ITS OWN SUSTAINABLE GROUNDWATER MANAGEMENT DISTRICT AND ITS OWN PLANTS. AND SOME OF THE SMALL DISTRICTS. THOUSAND OR LESS. THEY'RE GOING TO BE REQUIRED TO COME UP WITH PLANS. WHO'S GOING TO PAY FOR THAT. WHO'S GOING TO BE TECHNOLOGICALLY CAPABLE. OF COMING UP FOR THOSE PLANS THESE THINGS HAVE TO BE THOUGHT THROUGH BECAUSE IT'S JUST NOT REALLY EASY TO DO WHAT WE'RE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF THE SMALL. JURISDICTIONS IT NEEDS TO BE. ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM. DISCUSSION OR DEBATE SAYING NONE SENATOR HERTZBERG YOU MAY CONCLUDE. I JUST WANTED TO ADDRESSABLE I BELIEVE THIS ISSUE OF COST. COLLECT STATE IMPLEMENTATION OF- AS PART OF THIS DEBT THE COST HAS BEEN DEALT WITH I CAN'T DEAL WITH THAT SPECIFICALLY WILL CIRCLE BACK WITH SENATOR. THE IMPORTANT POINT IS THAT. BUT THIS IS PART OF THE LARGER TASK FORCE GROUP THAT WE'RE INVOLVED WITH THAT THAT WAS PART OF OUR LEGISLATION THAT WE DID EARLIER AND THIS WAS A RECOMMENDATION BY THE GDPR'S COUNTY DRUG TASK FORCE. AND THAT ALL OPPOSITION WAS WITH THE RECENT AMENDMENTS ALL OPPOSITIONS BEEN REMOVED SO TO THE EXTENT OF THOSE WERE IN DISCUSSIONS WHICH I REMEMBER THAT THEY WORK THE OPPOSITION REMOVED AND THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH THAT WHAT DID YOU ARE IN THE COUNTY SO I THINK WE SHOULD. BE TAKING CARE OF US RELIABLE. MEMBERS THIS IS ELIGIBLE FOR UNANIMOUS ROL CALL IS THERE ANY OBJECTION TO USING THE ANONYMOUS RECALL. SEEING NONE I THIRTY EIGHT NO% ZERO.

SAYING NO OBJECTION. HIGHS THIRTY EIGHT NO ZERO. MOVING ON TO FILE ITEM NUMBER FORTY FOUR SENATOR BRADFORD IS PREPARED PLEASE READ. SENATE BILL FIVE SIXTY SEVEN BY SENATOR BRADFORD AN ACT RELATING TO OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE SENATOR BRADFORD THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT S. B. FIVE SIX SEVEN IS BROCK ON CONCURRENCE. SP FIVE SIX SEVEN CREATES A PRESUMPTION OF SENTENCING JUDGMENT NOT TO SEAT THE MIDDLE TERM UNLESS THERE IS CLEAR AND SUPPORTING AGGRAVATING CIRCUMSTANCES THAT JUSTIFY IMPOSING THE HIGHER TERM SP FIVE SIX SEVEN PROVIDES THAT WHEN. HI TERMS ARE IMPOSED THE FACTS SUPPORTING THAT AGGRAVATING AGGRAVATION MUST BE STIPULATED BY THE DEFENDER OR SUBMITTED TO THE JURY AND PROVEN BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT OR FOUND BY THE COURT IN A BENCH TRIAL IN THE INSTANCE WHERE THERE WAS NO JURY INVOLVED. A SEMI AMENDMENTS ADDS CONFORMING LANGUAGE TO THE ENHANCEMENT STATUTE. WHICH IS SUNSETTING AT THE END OF THIS YEAR IT CLARIFIES THE BIFURCATION STANDARDS AND DOUBLE JOINS THIS BO WITH AB FIFTEEN FORTY AND EIGHTY ONE TWENTY FOUR. WITHOUT THIS MEASURE CURRENT LAW WITH SUNSET AT THE END OF THE YEAR. THE PROPER PROCESS FOR SYNCING WOULD REVERT TO A LAW THAT WAS IN PLACE BEFORE TWENTY TWENTY NINE FOR WHICH THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT HAS FOUND TO BE UNCONSTITUTIONAL ON THE BASIS THAT FACTS HAVE TO BE PRESENTED TO A JURY IMPROVE. PROVEN AGAIN BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT. THE IS THAT JUDGES ARE LOW TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO INTERPRET CUNNINGHAM CASE ABSENCE OUR GUIDANCE AND THIS CAUSES A LOT OF CONFUSION AND CHAOS WE HAVE AN IMPROVEMENT TO THE SINCE SINCE IT'S IN PROCESS IN THIS BILL AND IT CONFORMS TO THE JUDICIAL OPINION THAT. ABOUT RIGHTS THE PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE BEFORE WE PUT THEM IN JAIL FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME YOU SEE THOSE PEOPLE AS STATED EARLIER ARE BLACK AND BROWN AND WHEN THESE HIGHER SINCE INSTANCE ARM PULLS MORE SO THAN. ON OUR PART MEMBERS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A VOTE FOR SP FIVE SIX SEVEN BECAUSE- AIN'T EASY BUT SOMEBODY HAS TO DO IT MMHM. SENATOR NELSON. LADIES AND DOWN THE SENATE YOU KNOW HAVE BEEN A CRIMINALIST AND EASY BUT WE DON'T SEEM TO HAVE ANY PROBLEM FINDING INDIVIDUALS TO SO INDULGE IN THEIR LIVES. AND AGAIN THIS IS A PART OF A- THEN ATTEMPT AND I HOPE IT'S ONLY GOING TO BE AN ATTEMPT ON A FULL SUCCESS. IN MAKING IT HARDER. FOR THE POSITION A GREATER PUNISHMENTS FOR JUSTIFIED KIND OF BEHAVIOR BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT NOW. THAT'S A PRETTY HIGH STANDARD. IN I DON'T KNOW THAT WE NEED TO HAVE THAT KIND OF STANDARD. TRULY IF YOU'RE GONNA OPPOSE THE IMPOSITION OF A LOCAL MIDDLE AND MAXIMUM TERM LONG BEEN STANDING. IN OUR CODES WELL THE YEARS AND IT DOES GIVE THE DISCRETION. FOR THOSE IN CRIMINAL SENTENCING. I CALL IT PROGRESSIVE PREDICTABLE CONSEQUENCES MEETING IF YOU DO BETTER. THE CONSEQUENCES GET BETTER YOU DO WORSE THE CONSEQUENCES GET WORSE THAT'S JUST A SIMPLE. LIFE LESSON I BELIEVE. BUT AGAIN BACK TO THE MERITS OR DEMERITS OF THE BILL I WOULD URGE A NO VOTE THERE IS NO QUESTION THAT THIS WILL BE MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT. FOR THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM. TO IMPOSE THE OPERATOR. AND I'D ARGUE VOCIFEROUSLY. THERE ARE PLENTY OF CRUNCH IN CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES THAT JUSTIFY THE UPPER TURN. WE SHOULD NOT MAKE IT EASIER. DID NOT GET THE PRINTER. IS THERE FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM. ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. CENTRE BRADFORD YOU MAY CONCLUDE THANK YOU- WHEN PRESIDENT THIS DOESN'T CHANGE ANYTHING IT JUST REQUIRES THAT THE CIRCUMSTANCES THE EVIDENCE SUPPORTS THE HIGHER TERM JUDGE DEAL CAN IMPOSE THE HIGH TERM BUT WE'RE ASKING THAT YOU START WITH THE MINIMUM TURN AGAIN IF YOU EVER WERE TO VISIT- COURT ROOM AND YOU SEE BLACK AND BROWN PEOPLE AND THEY'RE THEY'RE THE ONES WHO ARE USUALLY GETTING THE HIGHER SENTENCES. IT IS NOT OUR OTHER BROTHERS AND SISTERS IN INFLUENT NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE THEY GET AWAY WITH MURDER MUCH OF THE TIME THESE ARE BLACK AND BROWN PEOPLE SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY LIVE IN THE WRONG NEIGHBORHOOD AWARE WITH THE WRONG GROUP AND THEY WERE IMPOSED- THEY IMPOSE A HIGHER SENTENCE ALL THE TIME. ON TO QUOTE A FAMOUS PHILOSOPHER JG MADELINE WOMEN LIVE BUT FACTS DON'T THE FACTS SPEAK FOR ITSELF THESE HIGHER SENTENCES. ARE ALWAYS IMPOSE ON BLACK AND BROWN PEOPLE. A TRACTOR RIVAL.

MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE READ SENATE BILL FIVE NINETY SIX BY SENATOR BACKER IN ACTION RELATING TO GREENHOUSE GASES CENTER RECORD THANK YOU MEMBERS AS DETAILED MY FORTHCOMING MEMOIR THE KING AND I CARBON EMISSIONS FROM CEMENT OR TRULY A GLOBAL ISSUE IN FACT EMISSIONS SORRY 7% OF ALL GLOBAL CARBON EMISSIONS ARE FROM CEMENT AND CONCRETE. THIS BILL IS ABOUT GETTING THE ESTIMATE INTRODUCE ZERO BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE AN ASSEMBLY METHODS MAKE IT CLEAR THE CARB CAN ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT THE STRATEGY NOT JUST HELPED DESIGN IT I'M PROUD THAT WE'VE GOT BIPARTISAN SUPPORT SO FAR AND RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR NINE VOTE. IS THERE ANY DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM. CENTER GROVE. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I RISE IN OPPOSITION BECAUSE YESTERDAY IT WAS ABOUT LAWN MOWERS AND WEED EATERS TODAY IT'S ABOUT CONCRETE AND CEMENT AND MARK MY WORDS COLLIES SPECIFICALLY THE MAJORITY LEADER AND MY COLLEAGUE FROM SANTEE TOMORROW IT'S GOING TO BE ABOUT HAIR SPRAY. IS THERE FOR ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. THAT WOULD BE A DISASTER SENATOR JONES. SENATOR JONES. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT- THE AUTHORS STATED IN IT AND IS OPENING COMMENTS THAT 7% OF THE GLOBAL EMISSIONS COMES FROM CEMENT- PRODUCTION I BELIEVE IS. I WAS GOING TO THAT HOUSE I'M WONDERING IF I COULD ASK THE- THE AUTHOR QUESTION PLEASE ON THAT NUMBER QUESTION TO THE AUTHOR. SURE THANK YOU HE SAID TO GIVE 7% IS THE GLOBAL NUMBER. DO WE HAVE A KIND OF A NUMBER QUANTIFIED FOR CALIFORNIA AND- WHAT'S CALIFORNIA'S SEMEN PRODUCTION REGARDING THE GLOBAL PERCENTAGE- IN TERMS OF OUR IF YOU LOOK AT ALL OF OUR GREENHOUSE GASES THAT CEMENT IS DEAR 2% OF CALIFORNIA'S GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. 32% ON THE ON THE- HI CALIFORNIA MISSIONS AND THEN EXTRAPOLATE THAT GLOBALLY YOU KNOW THAT NUMBER OBVIOUSLY COMES DOWN QUITE A BIT SMALLER- MEMBERS WITH THE POINT I'M TRYING TO MAKE HERE IS. CALIFORNIA HAS DONE A REAT JOB OF LOWERING OUR EMISSIONS WE REALLY HAVE AND THEN I REALLY DO APPLAUD THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD. ADVANCEMENTS OVER THE LAST TWENTY THIRTY FORTY YEARS I REMEMBER IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL MOVING TO CALIFORNIA TO SAN DIEGO SPECIFICALLY FROM COLORADO AND- HAVING SEX NEVER HAVING HAD A SMOG DAY IN COLORADO I DON'T WHAT THAT WAS- BUT WE HAD A COUPLE OF THEM. WHEN I WAS IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL- YOU KNOW BACK IN THE EIGHTIES. AND YOU KNOW WE'VE GOT OUR AIR QUALITY INTO A PRETTY GOOD PLACE IN CALIFORNIA AND WHAT I'M AFRAID OF IS WE'RE WE'RE JUST NOW ENTERING INTO THE LAW OF DIMINISHING RETURNS. WHERE WE'RE JUST YOU KNOW KINDA. HACKING AT THE EDGES ON THIS THING 2% YOU KNOW IT IS SO WHAT THAT TELLS ME IS IF WE CUT ALL OF CALIFORNIA'S EMISSIONS ON CEMENT. THAT WOULD LOWER CALIFORNIA'S EMISSIONS BY TWO PERCENT. BUT WHAT IMPACT DOES THAT REALLY MAKE IT GLOBALLY. AND I THINK AT SOME POINT TIME WE'VE GOT TO GET TO THE POINT HERE WERE WERE PASSING COMMON SENSE REGULATIONS ON AIR EMISSIONS- AND AS OUR- COLLEAGUE FROM BAKERSFIELD POINTED OUT YESTERDAY LAWN MOWERS AND EDGERS AND- AND SUCH- THAT'S GONNA MAKE. NO IMPACT GLOBALLY I BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL ALSO GLOBALLY- WERE WERE PASSED THE LAW OF DIMINISHING RETURNS AND I ASK FOR NO VOTE. SENATOR I KASKI. RISE IN SUPPORT R. AS IN SUPPORT OF SP FIVE FIVE NINE SIX AND THIS IS NOT A STORY OF MY FAIR CEMENT COMPANY OR MY FAIR LADY OR MY FAIR MY FOR ANYTHING IT'S REALLY A STORY ABOUT TECHNOLOGY THE GENTLEMAN FROM SANTEE IS RIGHT I MEAN IT'S NOT THAT BIG OF A CHUNK OF OUR PART OF THE GLOBAL ADMISSIONS AND IT'S NOT THAT BIG A CHUNK OF THE MISSIONS- INTERNATIONALLY PUT IT IS IT IS A CHUNK AND WHAT CALIFORNIA HAS TO OFFER. IN THE DEBATE ON GREENHOUSE GASES IS OUR TECHNOLOGY CHANGES WE KNOW THE AUTHOR HAS- THE CEMENT FACILITY IS SORT OF AN ART BETWEEN MEYER AND HIS HERE THAT HAS COME TO ALTERNATIVES TO BURNING COAL IN ORDER TO GET THE FIRE SO HOT TO MAKE THE CEMENT AND THIS IS WHAT WE BRING TO THE GLOBAL STAGES BY FORCING THE CITY BY MOVING THIS IN THIS AREA AND THE TECHNOLOGY CHANGES WE ARE GOING TO HAVE AN ADDITION THAT'S COULD BE MADE TO OTHER AREAS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD THAT WILL HELP THEM. AND YOU KNOW 7% URGE IN SUPPORT OF TECHNOLOGY IN IN SUPPORT OF THIS- STEP FORWARD WE- CONCURRENTLY ASSEMBLY. AMENDMENTS AND SP FIVE. NO SIX. ANY FURTHER TO AND DEBATE YES SENATOR LAN MEMBERS WERE TALKING CONCURRENCE I THINK THAT THE ASSEMBLY AMENDMENTS TO ADDRESS- ANOTHER INMATE MAKE THIS BILL LESS ONEROUS TO INDUSTRY. FIVE IN WAYS THAT I THINK A DRESS SOME OF THE CONCERNS OF BEEN RAISED BY HER FRIENDS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE SO I GUESS MY QUESTION IS YOU KNOW IT SEEMS LIKE. UNLIKE THE CUSTOMERS IN SWEENEY TODD THERE VIA THE BILL GOT A LITTLE HAIR CUT BUT NOT MURDER IF THE BILL WAS STILL KEPT INTACT HI CAN YOU SPEAK A LITTLE BIT TO THE AMENDMENTS- SENATOR- THAT ADDRESS SOME OF THE CONCERNS HAVE BEEN RAISED BY OUR FRIENDS IN THIS AREA I'M GONNA LET HIM DO THAT BUT BEFORE WE GET THERE HE CAN DO IT IN HIS CLOTHES IF YOU DON'T MIND ACTED. LIKE CALLING A CENTER LABOR. THANK YOU MADAM FOR. I DON'T USUALLY SPEAK ON CONCURRENCE BECAUSE WE'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO. AND I ALREADY SUPPORTED THE BILL I'LL BE SUPPORTING IT AGAIN TODAY BUT I JUST REMIND PEOPLE. THAT EVERYTHING IS CUMULATIVE. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT 2% FOR. CONCRETE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT LAWN MOWERS AND THE GAS LEAF BLOWERS. THEY'RE NOT ONE OFFS THEY'RE CUMULATIVE AND WHEN YOU PUT THEM ALL TOGETHER. THAT CREATES A BIGGER PROBLEM. ONE STUDY THAT I READ TALKED ABOUT. LAWN MOWERS GAS FLOWS WHAT NOT. ALL OF THEM COMBINED IN CALIFORNIA ACTUALLY. CREATE MORE GREENHOUSE GASES THAN CARS ON THE ROAD. I DON'T HAVE THE STADIUM FROM ME I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT. AND I ALSO WANT TO SAY THE AIR QUALITY IN CALIFORNIA IN SOME PARTS OF CALIFORNIA IS BETTER. PLEASE COME TO THE INLAND EMPIRE WHERE WE HAVE THE HIGHEST. RATES AND WHEN I WAS A YOUNG CHILD WITH SMOG DAYS WE COULDN'T SEE THE MOUNTAINS. WE CAN SEE THE MOUNTAINS NOW. BUT GUESS WHAT THE PARTICULATES ARE SMALLER AND THE AIR QUALITY IS JUST AS BAD. SO WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO. BUT I'LL JUST REMIND PEOPLE. CUMULATIVE IT'S NOT ABOUT THIS AND THIS IT'S ABOUT ALL OF IT. TOGETHER I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN IPHONE. SENATOR DOLLY. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS I JONES WAS GOING TO SPEAK ON THIS BILL BUT I THINK WE'RE REALLY MISSING THE POINT WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE MISSIONS WE TALKED ABOUT LAWN MOWERS AND WEED EATERS. BUILDING ELECTRIC. SEMI TRUCKS. WE NEED TO GO INTO THE WOODS. THEY'RE ON FIRE RIGHT NOW. AND THE IMPACTS THAT WE MAKE ARE SMALL IN THIS AREA WITH WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT 2% OF CALIFORNIA'S EMISSIONS. MAKING CONCRETE SOMETHING WE NEED EVERY DAY BUT WE ALSO NEED WATERSHEDS WE ALSO NEED. TREES THAT ACTUALLY SEQUESTER CARBON THAT AREN'T DEAD AND SO. I THINK THE POLICIES THAT COME OUT HERE THE PROBLEM. WE DON'T FOCUS ON THE AREA WHERE WE CAN REALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE. WHICH IS BY REDUCING WILDFIRE. YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT AIR QUALITY FOR THE LAST. TWO AND A HALF MONTHS. WE'VE SEEN IT EVEN HRE IN SACRAMENTO THERE QUALITIES NOT FROM CARS AND TRUCKS AND CONCRETE PLANTS. IT'S FROM THE FOREST BURNING DOWN. MILLIONS ARE MILLIONS OF ACRES IT'S JUST INCREDIBLE THAT WE CONTINUE TO REGULATE DRIVE THE COST OF LIVING UP IN CALIFORNIA TO HELP OUR AIR QUALITY. SOMEWHAT I GUESS BE BETTER WHEN WE DON'T. TALK ABOUT THE REAL EMISSION PROBLEM AND THE REAL EMISSION PROBLEM IS. THE FOREST SO FOR THOSE REASONS I'M NOT GOING TO BE VOTING FOR THIS BILL A MEMBER VOTING AGAINST IT AGAIN BECAUSE IT DOESN'T DO ANYTHING IN THE BIG PICTURE BIG PICTURE OF ACTUALLY CHANGING. GLOBAL WARMING. SENATOR JONES. MADAM PRESIDENT I JUST WANTED TO RESPOND QUICKLY BRIEFLY TO OUR CALLING FROM THE INLAND EMPIRE AND- BEAVER WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CUMULATIVE A FAX IN THAT THAT IS TRUE IN A BEATLE MANIA IS CUMULATIVE ALSO A COLLECTION OF PEOPLE EXCITED ABOUT- THE BEATLES I SUPPOSE- BUT ALSO- OUR COLLEAGUE FROM BEAVER- REALLY REALLY AND CONTINUOUSLY ALPINE'S. THE IMPACTS OF AIR QUALITY FROM THESE CONTINUED FOREST FIRES IN CALIFORNIA AND- YOU KNOW WHAT I KNOW AND A LOT OF OUR CONVERSATIONS PRIVATELY OR IN YOU KNOW WHEN WE'RE MEETING WITH FOLKS WE TALK ABOUT THAT AND IT SEEMS TO BE A GENERAL ATTITUDE OF THE LEGISLATURE THAT WORKERS WERE COGNITIVE. OF THESE FOREST FIRES AND THE IMPACT IT. OTHER THAN OUR OUR OUR- CALLING FROM BEAVER AND- I DON'T HEAR THE PASSION BEHIND THAT THAT SOME OF US. DISPLAYED PRIVATELY IN OFF THE FLOOR. HELLO I REPRESENT A DISTRICT IT'S- HAS A LOT OF FOREST AND- STATE PARKS AND FEDERAL. PART OF FOREST LANDS THAT ARE CLOSED AT THE FROM THE FEDERAL. PARKS RIGHT NOW ARE CLOSED. TO MOVE THOSE RESOURCES FROM SAN DIEGO TO THE PARTS IN CALIFORNIA WHERE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT NEEDS IN THE FIGHT THESE FOREST FIRES WE'VE GOT TO TAKE THIS SERIOUS. AND I JUST WANT TO STAND UP AND SUPPORT ARE CALLING FROM BEAVERTON NOTE LET HIM KNOW THAT THERE'S- MORE THAN JUST HIM ON THIS FLOOR TO CARE ABOUT THAT THANK YOU. CENTERMAN THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I WANT TO SEARCH IT MYSELF WITH THE COMMENTS FROM MY COLLEAGUE FROM CHINO THIS IS CUMULATIVE AND WE ARE AT A UNIQUE TIME RIGHT NOW- WE ARE FACING A CLIMATE CRISIS AND MAMMA MIA THIS IS QUITE A CRISIS THAT WE'RE FACING THE FUTURE FOR OUR CHILDREN AND BEYOND- LOOKS DISMAL AND WE HAVE A VERY LIMITED WINDOW RIGHT NOW TO TRY TO FIX THINGS A VERY SHORT TIME TO TRY TO ADDRESS THIS IS OUR SHOT. AND WE NEED TO BE FOLLOWING EXAMPLE OF ALEXANDER HAMILTON AND SAYING WE'RE NOT THROWING AWAY OUR SHOT. SIDE SUPPORT THIS BILL AND I URGE MY COLLEAGUES TO DO THE SAME. THANK YOU. THERE ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE- SAYING MAN SENATOR BAKER YOU MAY CONCLUDE AND THIS BILL IS ON CONCURRENCE. THANK YOU OR DO YOU WANT TO MAKE A FEW POINTS FIRST OF ALL TO THE POINT BUT MY COLLEAGUE FROM CHINO IS FIRST AT 7% IS A MASSIVE AMOUNT. ALL BUILDINGS IN CALIFORNIA ACCOUNT 412% OF OUR CARBON EMISSIONS TO LIKE 7% THAT'S A MASSIVE AMOUNT AND WE HAVE TO FIND REALLY RESHAPE EACH ASPECT OF OUR ECONOMY AND CEMENT HAS BEEN ONE OF THOSE HARD TO DECARBONISE INDUSTRIES. AND IT'S A WEIRD PLACE TO MAKE A STAND BECAUSE INDUSTRIES ACTUALLY BEEN SUPPORTIVE INDUSTRY'S BEEN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL FROM THE BEGINNING BECAUSE THEY WANT TO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION THEY'D RATHER BE PART OF THE SOLUTION. IN GETTING TO ZERO RATHER THAN HAVING SOMETHING OPPOSED. THE IMPOSED UPON THEM. TO THEY'VE BEEN PARTNERS IN THIS. INITIALIZATION CALIFORNIA IS 1% OF THE WORLD'S. CARBON EMISSIONS 1% SO YES EVERYTHING WE DO HERE MATTERS. BUT WHAT REALLY MATTERS IS WHAT WE CAN TO PUT POLICIES IN PLACE IN CALIFORNIA. THAT COULD BE EXPORTABLE POLICIES A PLACE IN CALIFORNIA. THAT ET THE MODEL FOR THE REST OF WORLD POLICIES IN CALIFORNIA THAT LIKE MY COLLEAGUE FROM FREEMAN SAID. CREATE NEW TECHNOLOGY THAT DENNIS DEPLOYED IN OTHER AREAS THAT'S WHEN WE HAVE AN OUTSIZED. IMPACT AND THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN HERE WE ARE GOING TO CREATE THE INDUSTRY FOR LOW CARBON CONCRETE WILL BE BACK NEXT YEAR. TO MAKE SURE THE GOVERNMENT IN CALIFORNIA BUYS THAT LOW CARBON CONCRETE. HELLO AND THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT CREATING SOLUTIONS THEN THAT CAN SCALE TO THE REST THE WORLD SO WHAT WE DO HERE. MATTERS OUR LEADERSHIP IN CALIFORNIA MATTERS AND THIS IS PART OF THAT LEADERSHIP AND IT'S AGAIN SUPPORTED BY INDUSTRY AND BIPARTISAN SUPPORT. THROUGHOUT THE IT'S HISTORY I TRY TO SAY LAST YEAR ON FIRES JUST PERSONALLY I. VERY FEEL FOR CALLING FROM FROM BEAVER AND THEIR SHORT MEDIUM AND LONG TERM SOLUTIONS WE DO EVERYTHING WE CAN IN THE SHORT TERM ON THOSE FIRES. IN THE MEDIUM TERM EVERYTHING WE CAN IN THE STANDING ON THE CONTROL BURNS USING TECHNOLOGY. BUT IN THE LONG TERM IT'S CLIMATE CHANGE THAT'S WHAT MADE THOSE FIRES KINDLING TO BURN AND SO WE HAVE TO COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE AND SO WE HAVE TO DO. AND PLAN FOR THE SHORT MEDIUM AND LONG TERM AND RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A VOTE. MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. ALAN I ARCHULETA I. ATKINS.

THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS. S. B. ONE SEVENTY IS BUDGET BILL JUNIOR IT CONTAINS BUDGET BILL ADJUSTMENTS PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE JUNE BUDGET AGREEMENT WE ADOPTED IN JUNE. MOST SIGNIFICANTLY THIS BILL APPROPRIATES FUNDING FOR VARIOUS RESOURCES PACKAGES WHEN WITH TODAY'S ACTION WILL BE AUTHORIZING SIXTEEN BILLION. NEW SPENDING DEDICATED TO FIGHT OUR CLIMATE CRISIS WILDFIRES DROUGHT AND IMPROVE OUR NATURAL ENVIRONMENT. BUT I WILL GO INTO SOME OF THE DETAILS IN JUST A MOMENT. IT ALSO. AUTHORIZES FIVE HUNDRED MILLION OF THE TWO BILLION THAT WE SET ASIDE. FOR STUDENT HOUSING A CAMPUS EXPANSION EXPANSION DR RICE IS FIVE HUNDRED MILLION. FOR THIS FISCAL YEAR TWO. OR HIGHER ED CAMPUSES. TO BUILD MUCH NEEDED STUDENT HOUSING. TELL ME GO BACK TO RESOURCES THE SIXTEEN BILLION I MENTION IS A HISTORIC LEVEL OF FUNDING FOR NATURAL RESOURCES AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION. WHEN THE BILLS ALL BE PRESENTING AND THAT WILL BE VOTING ON INCLUDE. THREE POINT SEVEN BILLION OVER THREE YEARS FOR CLIMATE RESILIENCY. ONE POINT FIVE BILLION IF WE ADD UP TODAY AND WHAT WE DID IN EARLY ACTION FOR WILDFIRES. FOUR POINT SIX BILLION OVER THREE YEARS TO ADDRESS OUR DROUGHTS AND WATER QUALITY ANOTHER WATER PROBLEMS. ONE POINT ONE BILLION FOR AGRICULTURE. A HUNDRED AND FORTY MILLION IN WHAT WE NOW CALL THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY BUT TO IMPROVE OUR WASTE RECYCLING AND REDUCTION. THREE POINT NINE BILLION OVER THREE YEARS. TO HELP US GET TO ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES. SO THAT WE ARE NOT EIGHTEEN AIR POLLUTION THAT CAUSES SO MANY OF US TO HAVE ASTHMA OR CARDIO PULMONARY OR OTHER PROBLEMS FOR FUELS OUR CLIMATE CRISIS. AT&amp;T ONE POINT FIVE BILLION FOR CAP AND TRADE SPENDING PLAN WHICH HAS SOME OVERLAP WITH THE ITEMS I MENTIONED ABOVE. FOR PERSPECTIVE THE TOTAL RESOURCES INVESTMENT IN TWENTY ONE IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. WAS ABOUT NINE POINT NINE BILLION. AND IF WE ADD THE FUNDING TO DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS AND ONGOING PROGRAMS THAT WE DID PREVIOUSLY MEETING IN JUNE. PLUS THAT WHICH WE ARE OPERATING TODAY WE ARE MORE THAN DOUBLING. THE INVESTMENT IN RESOURCES AS COMPARED TO LAST YEAR. AND THE STATE SENATE ALL OF US HERE. PLAYED A STRONG ROLE IN PROVIDING THIS UNPRECEDENTED AMOUNT OF FOCUSED FUNDING. TO ADDRESS OUR CLIMATE CRISIS OR DROUGHT OR WILDFIRES AND MORE. AMONG THE SENATE WINS INCLUDE. THE CLIMATE RESILIENCY PACKAGE THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSED TO US ONLY ONE POINT SHIFT SEVEN BILLION OVER THREE YEARS. BUT WE THOUGHT THAT WAS NOT ADEQUATE. LOOK WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE CRISIS RIGHT NOW. WE SEE THE IMPACTS RIGHT NOW SO WE BROUGHT THAT FUNDING UP TO THREE POINT SEVEN BILLION OVER THREE YEARS. THE BUDGET AND ACCOMPANYING TRAILER BILL PRESERVE THE SENATE PRIORITIES THAT WORK CAN CHANGE IN SP FORTY FIVE WHICH WAS A CLIMATE BONDS THAT WAS CIRCULATING HERE. INSTEAD WE'RE DOING IT INITIALLY THESE AUTHORIZATIONS AND DIRECTS HOW THOSE FUNDS ARE TO BE SPENT IN THE OUT YEARS. AND FOR ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES THE SENATE PUSHED FOR A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE TO THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSED. ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE FINDING. SO THAT WE'VE NOW ACHIEVED THREE POINT NINE BILLION OVER THREE YEARS INCLUDING TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION JUSTIN THIS FISCAL YEAR. AND THAT THOSE FUNDS ARE FOR CHARGING AND FUELING INFRASTRUCTURE PASSENGER CARS AND LIGHT DUTY TRUCKS DEDICATED INVESTMENTS TO ZERO EMISSION TRANSIT BUSES HEAVY DUTY TRUCKS IN OUR SCHOOL BUSES. IN THE WILDFIRE PACKAGE THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSED SEVEN HUNDRED AND EIGHT MILLION. THE SENATE WANTED A BILLION ANNUALLY FOR THE NEXT FIVE YEARS BECAUSE WE KNOW WILDFIRES ARE NOT GOING AWAY. AND THE OUTCOME THAT WE'RE ACHIEVING TODAY IS ONE POINT FIVE BILLION FOR THIS YEAR. WHICH IS TODAY'S ACTION PLUS OUR EARLIER ACTION AND OF COURSE AS WE ALL KNOW OUR DEDICATION TO CONTINUING. SIMILAR APPROPRIATIONS AS YEARS GO FORWARD. AND IN CONSERVANCIES THE SENATE FOUGHT HARD TO PROVIDE FUNDING DIRECTLY TO THE CONSERVANCY'S IN OUR DIFFERENT REGIONS CORPORATE WHO ARE FIGHTING OUR WILDFIRES INVESTING TO PREVENT OR WILDFIRES AND ADDRESSING CLIMATE RESILIENCE. AND THE FINAL OUTCOME IS TWO HUNDRED EIGHT MILLION TO CONSERVANCIES FOR WILDFIRE PREVENTION AT A MINIMUM OF SIXTY MILLION ANNUALLY FOR ALL STATE CONSERVANCY'S OVER THREE YEARS. SO EACH YEAR FOR THREE YEARS FOR CLIMATE RESILIENCE. S. B. NINE OH ONE EXTENSION THAT'S FOREST HEALTH NEED MINISTRATION WANTED TO KEEP TWO HUNDRED MILLION FUNDING IN OUR FREE HELP FROM OUR GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND. ANNUALLY FOR FOREST HEALTH. AND THAT WOULD HAVE COME TO ABOUT A BILLION OVER FIVE YEARS. THE SENATE EXTENDED THAT FOR SELF FUNDING. FOR A TOTAL OF SEVEN HUNDRED AND EIGHTY MILLION OVER SIX YEARS PRESERVING A HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILLION OF OUR GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS REDUCTION FUND. THAT WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO USE FOR. DIFFERENT PURPOSES AS WE UNDERSTAND AND APPRECIATE EITHER NEW TECHNOLOGIES OR NEW TOOLS TO FIGHT THE CLIMATE CRISIS SO WE ARE PRESERVING A HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILLION. IN FUNDING THAT'S NOT. LOCKED IN IN TERMS OF SPENDING IN OUR GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS REDUCTION FUND AND YET STILL DEDICATING SIGNIFICANT MONEY STORE FOREST HEALTH. FOR CONTRACT COUNTIES WE'VE INCLUDED FOURTEEN MILLION FOR CONTRACT COUNTIES TO PERFORM WELL FIRE FUEL REDUCTION WORK. AND THAT APPROPRIATION WAS INCLUDED IN THE BUDGET. ON AGRICULTURAL BURNING. WE HAVE FOUGHT TO INCLUDE ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY MILLION. SO THAT WE COULD HELP MOVE OFF OF AGRICULTURE BURNING. ENTROPY AND PROVIDE FUNDING FOR ALTERNATIVES SO THAT THE AIR IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. WOULD BE CLEANER. ORGANIC WASTE ORGANIC WASTE REMAINS FOR A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF THE WAYS THE CENTAUR LANDFILLS IN ONE SENSE THERE. IT PRODUCES METHANE EMISSIONS METHANE A VERY POWERFUL BUT SHORT LIVED CLIMATE GAS. BEYOND IF WE CAN DIVERT ORGANIC WASTE COMPOSTED AND OTHER THINGS THAT WE DO NT HAVE THAT RESULTING METHANE GAS SO THERE IS A HUNDRED AND NINETY FIVE MILLION IN OUR CAP AND TRADE SPENDING PLAN AND THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY PACKAGE FOR THAT PURPOSE AND IN THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE. THE SENATE PROPOSED AUTHORITY FOR DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE TO HAVE NEW STAFF TO DEAL WITH THE IMPLICATIONS OF ILLEGAL CANNABIS GROWS SUCH AS WATER THEFT AND CONTAMINATION OF OUR- RIVERS AND STREAMS WHICH OF COURSE IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT DURING THE STRETCH. AND THE FINAL OUTCOME WITH WHAT'S BEFORE US TODAY IS TWENTY NINE NEW STAFF POSITIONS. FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF. FISH AND WILDLIFE USING EXISTING FUNDING. THE ACTIONS BEFORE US TODAY ALSO INCLUDE MAJOR INVESTMENT. IN PREVENTING OUR DIMENSION METHANE BUT OTHER POWERFUL AND SHORT LIVED CLIMATE POLLUTANTS BECAUSE GETTING THOSE PREVENTING THOSE FOR HITTING OUR ATMOSPHERE RIGHT NOW. IMMEDIATELY ADDRESSES THE CLIMATE CRISIS BECAUSE THEY ARE SO MUCH MORE POWERFUL THAN JUST CO TWO AND THOSE INCLUDE ARE HSCS FROM REFRIGERANTS AND BLACK CARBON FROM VEHICLES AND OTHERS. MEMBERS ARE YOU KNOW THAT. WE ARE FULLY AWARE THAT CALIFORNIA THE NATION ON OUR GLOBE IS IN THE MIDST OF A CLIMATE CRISIS OUR FORCE ARMED FIRE DROUGHT IS OCCURRING THROUGHOUT THE LAND. OUR MAJORITY LEADER MENTION THE FACT THAT OVER THE LAST FOUR YEARS HAVE BEEN THE DRIEST IN pOVER FOUR HUNDRED YEARS. EXTREME HEAT HAS LITERALLY BEEN KILLING PEOPLE SEA LEVEL RISE AS WE'VE SEEN FROM HURRICANE IDA IS DESTROYING CITIES AND OUR COASTS. IN CALIFORNIA LED THE NATION IN GOAL SETTING AND PLANNING TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND HALT CLIMATE CHANGE. IN WITH THIS BUDGET THESE ACTIONS WERE TAKING WE ARE PUTTING OUR MONEY WHERE OUR MOUTH IS AND SUPPORTING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THOSE GOALS WITH REAL INVESTMENTS SO MAKE NO MISTAKE. THIS BUDGET IS THE LARGEST SINGLE INVESTMENT IN ENVIRONMENTAL AND CLIMATE RESILIENCY IN CALIFORNIA HISTORY. AND TO BE SURE WE NEED STRONG LAWS AND TARGETS TO MEET OUR CLIMATE GOALS BUT THE CRISIS IS HERE AND NOW IN THIS BUDGET PUTS THE MONEY DIRECTLY INTO THE PROGRAMS THAT ACHIEVE. OUR GOALS. WITH INVESTMENTS IN. OUR OUR OUR COMMUNITIES OUR FORESTS OUR PORTS ARE GOODS MOVEMENT OUR WASTE AND RECYCLING SYSTEMS AND SO MUCH MORE. IT IS A SITE SAID THE HISTORICAL COMMITMENT TO ADDRESSING OUR CLIMATE CRISIS AND VERY MUCH IN LINE WITH THE PROPOSALS MADE BY THE BY THE ADMINISTRATION. MEMBERS THIS BUDGET DOES MORE FOR CLIMATE THAN ANY SINGLE BILL IT WILL SAVE LIVES PROTECT OUR COASTS IN FORESTS CONSERVED LANDS INSURE PROPERTY IS PROTECTED. AND HELP THOSE SUFFERING FROM THE SCORCH OF EXTREME HEAT WITH THAT MEMBERS I ASK FOR YOUR I. VOTE. SENATOR HERTZBERG. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I WANT TO JOIN IN WITH THE INTENSITY AND- STRESSING THE EXTRAORDINARY NATURE OF. THIS MEASURE THAT WAS EXPRESSED BY THE BUDGET CHAIR. SOME DECADES AGO. WHEN WE TALKED ABOUT RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STANDARDS AND WE PASSED A B. THIRTY TWO AND WE CHANGE TAIL PIPE EMISSIONS. WE CHARACTERIZE THE CHALLENGES THAT WE FACED AS CLIMATE CHANGE. I WOULD SUGGEST. AS THE CHAIR OF THE BUDGET JUST SUGGESTED THAT WE CHARACTERIZE THIS IT'S NO LONGER CLIMATE CHANGE ITS CLIMATE CHANGED. AS A CONSEQUENCE IT REQUIRES US AS A LEGISLATURE AND AS THE GOVERNOR TO FIGHT ON A TWO FRONT WAR. TO DEAL WITH THE VARIOUS ISSUES THAT WE HAVE TO FACE THAT ARE CAUSING EXTRAORDINARY IMPACTS. IN OUR LIVES IN IN ANY ACROSS THE ENVIRONMENT AT THE SAME TIME WE HAVE TO PROVOKE PROVOKE POLICIES THAT SEEK TO PREVENT FURTHER ENDS OF CLIMATE BEING CHANGED. THE COMMUNITY IS THE FIRST OF ALL LET ME START BY SAYING I THINK I WANT TO STRESS A COUPLE THESE POINTS INTO IMPORTANT. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA EXPERIENCED ITS HOTTEST AUGUST ON RECORD IN TWENTY TWENTY JUST A YEAR AGO. WITH TEMPERATURES REACHING A HUNDRED AND THIRTY DEGREES FAHRENHEIT IN THE VALLEY IN THE COMMUNITIES THAT I REPRESENT THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY WHICH IS GROUND ZERO FOR THIS EXTREME HEAT. WOODEN HILLS HIT A HUNDRED AND TWENTY ONE DEGREES CENTER JONES. ARM LAST SEPTEMBER AND THAT'S THE SINGLE HOTTEST TEMPERATURE EVER RECORDED IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY MEMBERS. THE STAKES COULD NOT BE HIGHER ON AVERAGE EXTREME HEAT KILLS MORE PEOPLE IN THE U. S. THAN EVERY OTHER NATURAL DISASTER COMBINED I REPEAT THE EXTREME HEAT KILLS MORE PEOPLE IN UNITED STATES THAN TORNADOES AND FIRES AND FLOODS AND HURRICANES THAT WE'RE SEEING ON THE FRONT PAGES OF THE NEWSPAPER. EVEN THIS MORNING IN THE US IN THE LA TIMES. ALONG WITH RECORD BREAKING HEAT MEMBERS BECAME A RECORD BREAKING FIRST SEASONS AS WE NOTE THE TWENTY TWENTY FIRST SEASON WAS THE LARGEST IN CALIFORNIA HISTORY BURNING MORE THAN FOUR POINT TWO MILLION ACRES. AND SHATTERING ANY PREVIOUS RECORD WHICH WAS JUST SET TWO YEARS EARLIER IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. THE DEVASTATING FIRE SEASON TOOK THIRTY THREE LIVES AND MORE THAN TEN THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED STRUCTURES WERE DESTROYED. IT ALSO MOST IMPORTANTLY SPEWED HAS BEEN TALKED ABOUT THIS FOR THE LAST FEW DAYS. OF CARBON DIOXIDE IN THE YEAR TO EQUAL THE EMISSIONS OF MILLIONS OF PASSENGER VEHICLES OVER THE COURSE OF THE YEAR. WITH MORE THAN TWO MILLION ACRES BURNED SO FAR JUST IN THIS YEAR TWENTY TWENTY ONE. FIRE SEASON IS PROVING TO KEEP PACE AND MAY BE EXCEEDING WHAT HAPPENS IN A RECORD BREAKING TWENTY TWENTY. AND HE ALREADY DESTRUCTIVE FIRE SEASON WILL WORSEN THIS FALL WITH LONG TERM FORECAST SHOWING. LITTLE SIGNS OF RELIEF. CALIFORNIA ALSO FINDS ITSELF STARING DOWN ANOTHER CRIPPLING DROUGHT HARDLY FIVE YEARS AFTER THE LAST HISTORIC DROUGHT THAT I MENTIONED. IT WITH RESPECT TO AN EARLIER BILL HERE TODAY AND AS THE BUDGET YEAR REFERENCE. ALL OF CALIFORNIA IS ALREADY EXPERIENCING AT LEAST A MODERATE DROUGHT CONDITIONS WHILE 46% MEMBERS 46% OF THE STATE IS EXPIRING. EXCEPTIONAL DROUGHT CONDITIONS AT THE START OF THE CALENDAR YEAR ONLY 1% WAS IN THIS EXCEPTIONAL CONDITION. STATE AND FEDERAL AGENCIES ACROSS OUR GOVERNMENT. CONTINUED USE WATER ALLOCATIONS RESPONSE TO DROUGHT CONDITIONS. THESEALLOCATIONS ARE LOW AS WE KNOW AS LOW AS WE'VE NOT SEEN IN THEIR HISTORIC LEVELS. EXTREME HEAT WILDFIRES DROUGHT SEA RISE A SEA LEVEL RISE IS THE CHAIR INDICATED WERE WHERE WE WERE ALL IN THE MIDST OF THIS NEW CLIMATE REALITY AS I SUGGESTED NOT CLIMATE CHANGE. THIS IS OUR NEW UNFORTUNATE NORMAL. WITHOUT DRASTIC MITIGATION MEASURES THESE CLIMATE EVENTS WILL CONTINUE TO BECOME MORE FREQUENT CATASTROPHIC AND COSTLY. NOW THIS BUDGET I WANT TO STAND TALL AND STAND WITH THE BUDGET CHAIR AND SAY THAT THIS IS THE SINGLE LARGEST INVESTMENT CLIMATE RESILIENCY IN THE HISTORY OF THE STATE I REPEAT THIS IS THE SINGLE LARGEST INVESTMENT IN CLIMATE RESILIENCY IN THE HISTORY OF THE CITY CALIFORNIA. AS THE CHAIR INDICATED INCLUDES FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS WITH THE BILLION DOLLARS IN NEW SPENDING DEDICATED TO FIGHT CLIMATE CHANGE WHILE FIRES DROUGHT AND IMPROVE OUR NATURAL ENVIRONMENT. THIS BUDGET IS INDICATED INCLUDES THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO TAKE PEOPLE FROM EXTREME HEALTH. THROUGH TREE PLANTING COOL STRUCTURES AND CUTTING EDGE TECHNOLOGIES ONE POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS WILL BE INVESTED IN- IN IN PROPERLY MANAGING AND REINFORCING. CALIFORNIA'S MAJESTIC FORCED MILLIONS OF ACRES. HAVE BURNED AND NOW NEED TO BE TO BRING CALIFORNIA TOGETHER TO REFOREST. OVER THREE HUNDRED PARTNERS THROUGHOUT THE CITY CALIFORNIA FROM ALL CORNERS OF THE STATE. CAME TOGETHER TO SECURE TWO HUNDRED NINETY MILLION DOLLARS. TO MAKE OUR NEIGHBORHOODS AND COMMUNITIES GREENER COOLER AND MORE CLIMATE RESILIENCE WITH INVESTMENTS IN TREES AND URBAN GREENING. SO MUCH OF WHAT WE DO ONE POLICY WITH RESPECT TO CLIMATE CHANGE DEALS WITH AGENCIES AND GOVERNMENT LANGUAGE THAT FOLKS DON'T UNDERSTAND. I REMEMBER I USED TO TALK ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE YEARS AGO IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY CLIMATE CHANGE MAKE THE YOUR CONDITIONING STOPPED WORKING. THE STANDARDS OF THE ISSUES THAT WE HAVE TO FOCUS ON OUR NEIGHBORHOODS REAL PEOPLE REAL PEOPLE'S LIVES. AND TREES ARE THE BEST FRONTLINE DEFENSE AGAINST EXTREME HEAT. TREES ARE MULTIPLE BENEFICIAL AND COST EFFICIENT GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE IN FACT TREES BUT THE ONLY INFRASTRUCTURE THAT GROWS IN VALUE. OVER TIME. IN ONE YEAR A MATURE TREE WILL ABSORB MORE THAN FORTY EIGHT POUNDS OF CARBON DIOXIDE. FROM THE ATMOSPHERE IN A GROUP FOREST CAN ABSORB TWICE THE CO TWO PRODUCED BY THE AVERAGE CARS ANNUAL MILEAGE. WE FOUGHT HARD TO MAKE THIS HISTORIC INVESTMENT FLOWS DIRECTLY TO CALIFORNIA NEIGHBORHOODS FROM REDWOOD FORESTS TO THE SOUTHERN BORDER TO PROTECT PEOPLE. FROM THE THREATS OF WILDFIRES EXTREME HEAT AND DROUGHTS THAT IS WHAT SO FUNDAMENTAL AND IMPORTANT ABOUT THIS BUDGET AND JUST DOESN'T. ADDRESS OUR CLIMATE REALITY IT IMPROVES THE QUALITY OF LIFE FOR OUR NEIGHBORHOODS I KNOW I'M GOING ON A LONG BODIES ONCE A COUPLE MORE QUICK POINTS. THIS BUDGET IS ABOUT TAKING ACTION. IT'S ABOUT TAKING ACTION. THOUGHT ABOUT LONG TERM PLANS TWENTY OR THIRTY OR FORTY YEARS AGO FROM NOW PEOPLES LIVES ARE BEING IMPACTED TODAY SCREEN HE IS IMPACTING PEOPLE'S LIVES TODAY. FORESTS ARE BURNING TODAY WE NEED TO MARRY THE LONG TERM VIEW BUT ALSO TAKE A VIEW IN TERMS OF IMPACTS ON PEOPLE'S LIVES AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BUDGET DOES AT HISTORICALLY HIGH LEVELS I ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT THIS MEASURE. SENATOR. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT- I RISE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF S. B. ONE SEVENTY- BUT WITH SOME CONCERNS ARE DISPELLED DOES MUCH TO SUPPORT OUR OR WILDFIRE WATER RESILIENCE IT LEAVES OUT FUNDING TO PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR VECTOR TO AFGHAN CITIZENS AND SUPPORT COMFORTABLE MET BY CALIFORNIA COLLEGE STUDENTS IT ALSO PROVIDES MUCH NEEDED FUNDS FOR PUBLIC SAFETY EQUIPMENT FOR CITIES. HOWEVER THIS BILL ALSO INCLUDES PROVISIONS THAT ESTABLISH A GRANT PROGRAM FOR MULTI BENEFIT LAND RE PURPOSING FOR GROUNDWATER SUSTAINABILITY PROJECTS THAT REDUCE GROUNDWATER USE. REPURPOSED IRRIGATED AGRICULTURAL LAND AND PROVIDE WILDLIFE HABITAT. THESE ARE ALL WORTHY CAUSES DON'T GET ME WRONG BUT I AM CONCERNED THAT BY INCENTIVIZING THE CONVERSION OF AGRICULTURAL LAND WE MAY BE PUTTING FARM. AS THIS PROGRAM IS FOR WE SHOULD DO ALL WE CAN TO ENSURE THAT THIS POTENTIAL UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE DOES NOT BECOME A REALITY AND MY CONCERN IS THAT I DON'T SEE ITS SUPPORT TO PUT YOU KNOW FURTHER SUPPORT FOR FARM WORKERS IF THAT IS THE CASE. I ALSO- AND WE COULD DO A LOT MORE WHEN IT COMES TO WATER AND PROVIDING WATER AND WE ARE EXPECTING THIS WATER SHORTAGE IN EIGHTY THREE OF THE TWO HUNDRED FOUR BASINS ACROSS THE UNITED STATES AND- IT'S ONLY GOING TO INCREASE IN THE SITUATIONS GOING TO ONLY GET WORSE AND I KNOW THERE'S THIS BUDGET HAS A LOT TO DO TO ADDRESS THE NOW BUT WE REALLY NEED TO ALSO START ADDRESSING THE NEAR FUTURE- LIKE I SAID THERE'S A LOT OF GOOD THINGS IN THIS IN THIS BUDGET TRAILER BILL- THERE'S SOME CONCERN THAT I HAVE AND I HOPE THAT YOU'LL KEEP THEM IN MIND AS- YOU KNOW WE- WE MOVED THE- LEGISLATIVE YOU'RE- ALONG AND- BUT I. RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AIBO. SENATOR AKOWSKI. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I TO RISE IN SUPPORT OF- AB OR SB ONE SEVENTY I WOULD LIKE TO START OFF WITH THANKING THE BUDGET CHAIR IN THE MAJORITY LEADER FOR THEIR ELOQUENT- PRESENTATION AND OUR EVERYTHING THEY SAID I'VE CHECKED THE FACTS THAT ARE TRUE- BUT ALSO. GIVING US A PERSPECTIVE OF WHAT'S HAPPENING AND ALSO- WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE- PRO TEM AND HER STAFF CHRIS WOULDN'T KICK LEOPARD IS WELL AS THE- STAFF WITH- A SEPT TWO JAMES HACKER IN CHILE AND ROY HAVE BEEN INSTRUMENTAL IN SHAPING THE SENATE'S VIEWS THAT ARE BRACED GUY HERE IN SP- ONE SEVENTY. THERE'S A LOT MORE WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE I THINK EVERYBODY HAS A SENSE MY ANXIOUSNESS- WITH THIS BUT I WAS RECALLING- IN. TWENTY SEVENTEEN WHEN- THAT PROTEIN KEVIN DE ON ASK ME SERVE ON BUDGET SET TWO AND AT THAT TIME WE WERE SPENDING NO MONEY RELATIVELY SPEAKING ON FOREST HEALTH THERE WAS A SIMPLE FIVE YEARS AGO AND THEN. AT THAT YEAR WE PUT IN TWO HUNDRED FORTY MILLION FORTY FOUR SOUTH WAS A BIG. STATEMENT TO SAY THE SENATE AND IT GOT IT ONE AND IN THE FINAL CAPTAIN TREE BUDGET THAT WE WOULD BE SPENDING THAT MONEY ON FOREST HEALTH WE REPEATED THAT IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND MY GOOD FRIEND FROM NAPA. SEEING THE WISDOM AND WHAT THE SENATE BUDGET ACTION INCORPORATED INTO S. BEAT NINE OH ONE AND NOW WE'RE HERE TO DATE EXTENDING THAT MINIMUM INVESTMENT. BUT AS THE- CHAIR BUDGET. IS SET. WE'RE SPENDING. ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION BILLION DOLLARS AN HOUR WILDFIRES YOU KNOW THERE'S SOME PROGRAMS THAT WE LIKE TO HAVE- SPENT SPENT BUT THAT IS. AND UNPROFESSIONAL ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION IN ONE YEAR. SO EVERYBODY KNOWS THE SENATE'S GOAL HERE IS TO SPEND A MINIMUM OF A BILLION DOLLARS FOR THE NEXT FIVE YEARS I'M HERE TO ASK PEOPLE TO VOTE FOR THIS BUT YOU HAVE MY COMMITMENT WHEN THE DISCUSSIONS GO ON MOVING FORWARD WITH IT. AT LEAST I FOR ONE IS GETTING A GOOD USE ALL THE EFFORTS THAT I HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT BECOMES A REALITY IF NOT MORE- THE HISTORIC IMPLICATIONS OF THIS OF THE OF THE OF THE ATTENTION WE'RE PUTTING INTO CLIMATE AND DROUGHT IN. THE FOREST IS REALLY- SOMETHING TO BE TO TAKE PAUSE WITHIN TECH AND TO REALIZE THAT THE ARCHITECTURE HAS REALLY BEEN THE CALIFORNIA STATE SENATE EACH AND EVERYONE OF YOU SHOULD BE. PROUD OF THE WORK THAT HAS BEEN DONE THE GROUNDWORK THAT WAS LAID OUT IN S. P. FORTY FIVE FROM THE GENTLEMAN FROM- BUT LACKING YADA FLINT. WOULD END THAT WE USE TO. TO DESIGN THE PACKAGE- THAT IS NOW THE CLIMATE AND INITIATIVE- I WANT TO BE OPTIMISTIC I WANT TO BE FORWARD LOOKING AND I WANTED TO- IS. UNDERSCORE EVERYTHING THAT'S BEEN SAID HERE N. N. REMIND FOLKS THAT THE FRAMEWORK IS SET WE HAVE LOTS OF WORK TO GO FORWARD AND I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THE NEXT BUDGET SESSION AND SOME MORE VICTORIES FOR THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HER TO HAVE A- SENATOR PERDUE KENO. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT AND THE SENATORS OBVIOUSLY I RISE TODAY IN STRONG SUPPORT OF SB ONE SEVENTY AND I WANT TO ECHO THE COMMENTS OF APPRECIATION TO OUR BUDGET CHAIR ARE PRO TEM IN OUR BUDGET STAFF IN OUR BUDGET THE SUBCOMMITTEE CHAIRS AS WELL- AS IT'S BEEN SAID THIS BUDGET REPRESENTS THE SENATE'S FRAMEWORK THIS BUDGET REPRESENTS THE SENATE'S PRIORITIES AND OUR NEGOTIATORS HELD FIRM AND MADE SURE THAT THE PRIORITIES THAT WE DISCUSSED EARLIER IN THE SESSION- WERE INCLUDED. IN THIS BUDGET BILL JUNIOR- EARLIER THIS YEAR HAS BEEN NOTED SENATOR ALAN HERZBERG HER TADO RUBIO AND STERN AND I AUTHORED THE CLIMATE RESILIENCY BOND SP FORTY FIVE AND FOR SEVERAL YEARS THE SENATE HAS WORKED ON DEVELOPING THIS FRAMEWORK AND TO INCORPORATE THIS INTO A BUDGET BILL JUNIOR IS A IS A REMARKABLE ACCOMPLISHMENT FOR OUR TEAM TO TAKE OUR FRAMEWORK THAT'S BEEN GOING ON FOR YEARS AND MAKE SURE IT HAPPENED THIS YEAR WHEN FUNDS WERE AVAILABLE. TO MAKE IT HAPPEN AS THE BUDGET YEAR NOTED THE CLIMATE RESILIENCY PACKAGE PROVIDES THREE HUNDRED SIXTY NINE MILLION FOR TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE AN ADDITIONAL TWO POINT NINE BILLION FOR TWENTY TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE AND ONE POINT TWO BIT THREE BILLION IN TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR WHICH TOTALS THREE POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS OVER THREE FISCAL YEARS. WE'VE SEEN. THAT THIS YEAR'S DEADLY WILDFIRES ON THE HEELS OF LAST YEAR'S CATASTROPHIC EVENTS AND DEVASTATING MULTI YEAR DROUGHT CLEARLY DEMONSTRATE. THAT THE IMPACTS OF OUR CLIMATE CRISIS ARE HEARING NOW. AND ARE ALREADY COSTING CALIFORNIANS THEIR PROPERTY THEIR LIVES AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS EVERY YEAR. EVEN WITH OUR RECENT INVESTMENTS TO REDUCE FIRE RISK THE STATE IS BEHIND THE CURVE. WE MUST TAKE AGGRESSIVE STEPS TO ENSURE COMMUNITIES AND NATURAL RESOURCES CAN ADAPT. TO THE CHANGING CLIMATE AND TO INCREASE RESILIENCY IN THE FACE OF MOUNTING CLIMATE IMPACTS. TODAY WITH SP ONE SEVENTY WE ARE DOING JUST THAT. THIS BUDGET BILL IS THAT AS THE MAJORITY LEADER MENTION IS THE SINGLE LARGEST INVESTMENT IN CLIMATE RESILIENCY. IN THE HISTORY OF THE STATE AS IT FOCUSES ON CLIMATE CHANGE WHILE FIRES DROUGHT EXTREME HEAT. AND COASTAL SEA LEVEL RISE AGAIN THE LARGEST INVESTMENT IN THOSE AREAS IN HISTORY. BUDGET BILL JUNIOR SETS FORTH IMMEDIATE RESPONSES TO THE CLIMATE CRISIS AND UNDERSCORES THE SENATE STRONG LEADERSHIP. AND COMMITMENT TO ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION FIRE RESILIENCY AND OUR OPEN SPACE MANAGEMENT. IT'S BEEN MENTIONED THAT THE CONSERVANCY'S WHICH ARE LOCALLY DRIVEN. RESOURCE FOR THE STATE HAVE BEEN EMBRACED IN THIS BUDGET THAT IS SOMETHING THAT THE SENATE INSISTED AND MADE SURE WAS INCLUDED IN EIGHT SP ONE SEVENTY. THAT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE STATE LOCAL CONSERVANCIES AND LOCAL ELECTED OFFICIALS IS BOTH BOTTOM UP AND TOP DOWN IN THAT WE PROVIDE THE RESOURCES THEY PROVIDE THE LOCAL. MANAGEMENT AND FOCUS ON PRIORITIES ON THE LOCAL LEVEL THIS IS A RARE AND TERRIFIC FEAT THAT WAS PULLED OFF. BY THE STATE SENATE THROUGH THIS BUDGET PROCESS AND AGAIN I WANT TO GIVE A SHOUT OUT TO OUR BUDGET TEAM THAT WAS WORKING DILIGENTLY AND THE BUDGET CAIR AND THE PRO TEM. TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR PRIORITIES WERE THE FRAMEWORK OF THIS BUDGET AND THAT CLIMATE THE CLIMATE CRISIS IS BEING IMMEDIATELY ADDRESSED THROUGH THE BUDGET ALLOCATION THAT ONCE THIS IS SIGNED. THE MONEY AND THE RESOURCES BECOME AVAILABLE TO ADDRESS WELL WE HAVE ALL BEEN SEEING ON THE NEWS. THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA AND AGAIN RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR STRONG I VOTE ON SB ONE SEVENTY. SENATOR DOLLY. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS I. HELLO TO RECAP A LITTLE BIT OF THIS THIS LAST YEAR WHAT WE'VE- ATTEMPTED TO DO IT SAID ON. SUB TWO AND I OF THAT COMMITTEE GREAT MEMBERS THERE TO WORK WITH. IN JANUARY WE TALKED ABOUT THIRTY ACTION MONIES WHICH WE PUT INTO THE BUDGET BECAUSE WE KNEW. GOING INTO THIS DROUGHT THAT WE WERE GONNA HAVE. FIRES AND- IT WAS TRUE BUT WHAT HAPPENED IN THAT PROCESS IS THAT THE MONEY GOT TAKEN AWAY. AND IT GETS SPENT. SO WE CAME BACK IT WAS A NO WE'RE GOING TO DO IT SO WE DID IT BUDGET. THE BUDGET. AND WE PUT THE MONEY AND IF YOU RECALL. I STOOD ON THE FLOOR SAID WE'RE GONNA HAVE A CLEANUP BILL WHICH THAT'S THIS BILL TO ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT HOW WE'RE GONNA SPEND THE MONEY. S. FIRES WERE BURNING WHEN WE WERE IN RECESS. I DID SOME HOMEWORK ACTUALLY ONE OUT AND IN RESEARCH AND FOUND THAT I HAVE THE LIST RIGHT HERE IN MY HAND. OF FOUR HUNDRED AND SIXTY THOUSAND. REPORTER SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS WITH THE PROJECTS. A CROSS THE STATE THESE ARE YOUR DISTRICTS. BETTER SHOVEL READY SYKORA AND NEPA PROJECTS THAT WOULD DO BETTER TATIAN MANAGEMENT THROUGHOUT THE STATE. I BROUGHT THIS LIST BACK AND I SUBMITTED IT TO THE BUDGET CHAIR. TO THE BUDGET SHARE IN THE SIMILE. I WORK WITH MY COLLEAGUES ON SUB TO TRY TO GET. THIS EMPLOYMENT. AND IT DIDN'T HAPPEN. SO I CAME TO OUR BUDGET HEARING A COUPLE NIGHTS AGO AND I ASKED WHY AREN'T THESE PUT IN. EITHER SHOVEL READY JOBS DOES MY DISTRICT BURNING DOWN. AND I DID A MOTION TO PUT THESE- PROJECTS ACTUALLY IN THE BUDGET. NOW I'M GONNA SAY THANK YOU TO THE BUDGET CHAIR AND ALL OF ALL OF YOU WHO SIT ON BUDGET. AND HAVE LISTENED TO THE FRUSTRATIONS I HAVE IT'S NOT THE MONEY WE HAVE. TONS OF MONEY IT'S HOW WE GET THE MONEY OUT THE DOOR. THAT'S BEEN MY FRUSTRATION IS THAT. CAL FIRE CHIEF TOM PORTER SAID E'RE WE'RE NOT EQUIPPED TO SPEND MONEY IN THE TWENTY FIVE YEARS I'VE BEEN ELECTED I'VE ALWAYS BEEN TRYING TO FIND MONEY. NEVER HAD MUCH OF A PROBLEM SPINNING. THESE FIRE SAFE COUNCILS ARE CD'S AND COUNTIES HAVE THE ABILITY TO GET THIS MONEY OUT. YES I WILL CONCEDE THAT MONEY'S GOING TO CONSERVATIVES THEY WILL BE ABLE TO GET SOME THIS MONEY OUT. BUT WE NEED TO FAST TRACK THIS. MY BUDGET AMENDMENT SAID WE WILL PUT THESE PROJECTS ON THE GROUND BY JANUARY ONE. IN THIS PROCESS WE HAVE RIGHT NOW. IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN. AS WE BURN THE FIRE THAT BURNED INTO THE CALDOR FIRE THAT BURNED INTO LAKE TAHOE WHICH IS STILL BURNING. THERE'S A FUEL BREAK AS IT IS A FIRE CAME OVER THE RIDGE IT WE BACKFIRED- THE CAL FIRE WAS ABLE TO BACKFIRE AND SAVE THE COMMUNITY. THESE WILDLAND URBAN INTERFACE FUEL BREAKS SAVE YOUR COMMUNITIES IF WE WERE TO HAVE ONE AROUND GREENVILLE THERE WOULD STILL BE A TOWN THERE. SO FOR ME IT'S NOT ABOUT I WANT TO COMMEND THAT IS YOUR TRUE EVERYTHING THAT WAS SAID IS TRUE THIS IS MORE MONEY THAN EVER BUT IT'S HOW WE SPEND THE MONEY. IT'S MY ARGUMENT WHETHER WE SHOULD FUND TO. READ OR REGULATE. YOU KNOW WEEDERS LAWN MOWERS VERSUS PLANTING TREES AND SAVING TREES. THE SENATOR FROM SAN FERNANDO MADE MY CASE WE TALKED ABOUT TREES. MILLION ACRES. IN MY DISTRICT ALONE THIS YEAR. IS BURNING. YOU KNOW ME TREES THAT IS THAT'S A LOT OF TREES TO PLANT COSTS A LOT OF MONEY IF WE COULD SAVE THOSE TREES WILL SEQUESTER CARBON. WE CHANGE. OUR CLIMATE CHANGE MODEL FASTER THAN ANYTHING ELSE. THAT'S MY FRUSTRATION MEMBERS AND I. AND I SAID DURING THE BUDGET. I'M NOT GOING TO GO AWAY I'M GONNA KEEP COTINUE TO HOUND AND WORK UNTIL WE GET. THESE PROJECTS IMPLEMENTED IN ON THE GROUND THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO MAKE THE DIFFERENCE FOR THOSE REASONS I'M NOT GOING TO SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY. UNTIL WE ACTUALLY PRIORITIZE AND GET THE MONEY TO GO AROUND AND DO THE JOBS THAT ARE NOT JUST IN MY DISTRICT THEY'RE YOUR DISTRICTS AS WELL. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. SENATOR KAMMERER. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I TOO. RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF SB ONE SEVENTY- AND I TOO WANT TO THANK THE BUDGET CHAIR IN THE BUDGET STAFF FOR WORKING INCREDIBLY HARD THIS BUDGET SEASON WHICH FOR THEM I AM SURE HAS BEEN NEVER ENDING- IT IS TRUE. CLIMATE PROTECTION IS INCREDIBLY REAL- AND IT IS HAPPENING AT A FASTER AND FASTER PACE- YOU KNOW THIS YEAR IT HAS BEEN THE HOTTEST NATIONALLY IN THIS COUNTRY SINCE THE DUST BOWL IN NINETEEN THIRTY SIX AND THAT THOSE TEMPERATURES ARE GOING UP AND UP AND UP. INTO THE POINTS MADE BY THE BUDGET CHAIR AND THE MAJORITY LEADER AND I CHERISH APPROPRIATIONS THE GOOD SENATOR FROM PASADENA- WE HAVE GOT TO GET THIS UNDER CONTROL. AND TO THE MAJORITY LEADER'S POINT THIS MAY BE IN FACT THE SINGLE LARGEST CLIMATE INVESTMENT IN OUR STATE'S HISTORY BUT I DO JUST WANT TO SHARE THAT WE ARE CONTINUING TO LEAVE SOUTH LA OUT A COMMUNITY POPULATED BY BLACK AND BROWN FAMILIES. ON A NON CLIMATE RELATED NOTE THAT IS ALSO IN THIS BUDGET I DO WANT TO SHARE THAT I THINK TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR THE COURT APPOINTED SPECIAL ADVOCATES IS A WALL FULL AMOUNT GIVEN THE WORKLOAD AND THE NUMBER OF YOUTH THAT ARE IN OUR CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM IN LOS ANGELES. THESE ARE CHILDREN WHO ARE ABUSED AND NEGLECTED AND ARE UNDER THE CARE OF THE DEPENDENCY COURT- CHILD WELFARE CASES IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY OR AT A FOURTEEN YEAR HIGH IN LOS ANGELES AND WE WANT TO CONTINUE TO SUPPORT- CASA OR COURT APPOINTED SPECIAL ADVOCATES IN THE INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT WORK THAT THEY DO TO PROTECT OUR YOUNG PEOPLE IN THE SYSTEM. SO HOPEFULLY THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO WORK ON AND THE BUDGET YEARS IN THE FUTURE. YOU KNOW I ALSO WANT TO SAY I KNOW THAT OUR MAJORITY LEADER ENUMERATED A NUMBER OF GOOD THINGS THAT ARE IN THIS BILL I WANT TO ADD TO THAT- FUNDING FOR HYDROGEN REFUELLING INFRASTRUCTURE. AND ALSO FUNDING FOR ZERO EMISSION FLEETS. AND I ALSO WANT TO ADD THAT OF ALL OF THE CONSERVANCY'S THAT ARE IN THIS STATE THE BALDWIN HILLS CONSERVANCY GOT THE LEAST AMOUNT OF MONEY- AND SO I ALSO FEEL COMPELLED TO REGISTER MY DISCONTENT. WITH THAT ALLOCATION AGAIN- YOU KNOW THE FISH IN SANTA MONICA ARE ACTUALLY GETTING MORE MONEY THAN THE BALDWIN HILLS CONSERVANCY. AND THIS CONSERVANCY SERVICES NEIGHBORHOODS THAT ARE IDENTIFIED AS DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. BASED ON THEIR MEDIAN INCOME. AND HIS LOCATION FALLS UNDER THE TOP 20% OF THE MOST ENVIRONMENTALLY POLLUTED. AND SOCIALLY VULNERABLE AREAS IN CALIFORNIA AS MEASURED BY THE CAL ENVIRO SCAM. YOU KNOW THIS CONSERVANCY HAS AQUATIC MIGRATORY BIRDS AND WETLAND ECOSYSTEMS IS WORKING ON FUEL TREATMENT PROJECTS TO REDUCE WILDFIRE RISK. AND TO PROMOTE WATERSHED HEALTH AND TO PROTECT OUR WATERSHED TRIBUTARIES. AND DAY HERE- DEPARTMENT SAY THAT SOUTH LA IS NOT A PRIORITY IT'S NOT CONSIDERED A HIGH RISK IS REALLY INSULTING TO ME. AND MY THE NEIGHBORS AND THE CONSTITUENCIES AND THE RESIDENTS OF THE BALL HOWARD HILLS AND SURROUNDING AREAS THAT I REPRESENT- JUST BECAUSE WE ARE NOT ON FIRE AT THIS MOMENT. DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE'RE NOT AT RISK AND IT ALSO DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE DON'T HAVE THE ONLY URBAN CONSERVANCY IN THIS STATE. THAT SERVICES THE KINDS OF COMMUNITIES THAT WE ROUTINELY TALK ABOUT MAKING THIS GREAT STATE MORE ACCESSIBLE TO. SO WHILE I STAND IN COMPLETE SUPPORT FOR SB ONE SEVENTY I WOULD JUST CONTINUE WHAT TO URGE US TO CONSIDER. COMMUNITIES LIKE SOUTH LA IN THE URBAN CENTERS OF LOS ANGELES THAT WILL CONTINUE TO DESERVE AN EQUITABLE SHARE OF THESE KINDS OF BUDGET DOLLARS THANK YOU. SENATOR PENN. HE MET PRESIDENT- CENTERS- I TO SURPRISE IN SUPPORT OF SB ONE SEVENTY AND- ONE TWO A FIRST OF ALL OF COURSE- I APPRECIATE THAT TREMENDOUS WORK BY THE- BUDGET STAFF OR BUDGET CHAIR- AND BUDGETS OF CHAIRS AND DOES WELLS ARE- PRO TEM AS WELL AND- YOU KNOW CERTAINLY- THIS BUDGET PRESENTED A TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITY TO DEAL WITH- SOME VERY SERIOUS ISSUES FACING OUR STATE AND ACTUALLY THE WORLD SO I KNOW THAT MUCH HAS BEEN TALKED ABOUT IN TERMS OF THE WORK ON CLIMATE CHANGE I DID WANT. TO ALSO JUST BRIEFLY MAKE REFERENCES WERE I TALKING ABOUT THE WORLD- DESCENDED CREDIT CLIMATE CRISIS WE'RE SILL DOING IT BECAUSE OF IT SO IN IN IN THIS- BUDGET JUNIOR BILL WE ARE GOING TO BE- PUTTING IN HALF A BILLION DOLLARS OF FUNDING TO THE DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH TO ADDRESS- COVE IN TERMS LAB CAPACITY SO FORTH ANOTHER EIGHT HUNDRED ACTS ON THIS NINE HUNDRED- MILLION ARE ALMOST A BILLION DOLLARS TO TRY TO KEEP OUR SCHOOLS OPENING KEEPER KIDS SAFE. AS WELL AS- SOME ADDITIONAL- FUNDING TO PUBLIC HEALTH TO TRY TO ADDRESS. DISPARITIES AND ADVERSITY COVE IN NINETEEN RESPONSE ACTIVITIES TO ADDRESS RACIAL ETHNIC DISPARITIES AND OTHER DISPARITIES FOR UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS SO I DO APPRECIATE THAT THOSE ARE MAINLY FEDERAL FUNDS I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE CONTINUE TO EXERCISE OVERSIGHT- AND- THE EASE OF THOSE FUNDS AS A LEGISLATURE- BUT DO APPRECIATE THAT- WE ARE MAKING SOME SERIOUS INVESTMENTS HERE THEY'RE GONNA BE VERY IMPORTANT AND- AND THAT- YEAH. WE NEED TO HAVE A OF WORK TO DO REGARDING- COVETED AND- AND ENOUGH OF IT ALSO MAKE NOTE THE- THE PRESIDENT AS WELL AS SAYS TAKING SOME ADDITIONAL STEPS- TODAY WITH HIS OWN AUTHORITY AND- AND- WE NEED TO. BE SURE WE FOLLOW UP ON THOSE AS WELL AND FINALLY- IS- THE SENATOR WHO REPRESENTS- PERHAPS THE DISTRICT WITH- THE LARGEST NUMBER OF AFGHAN REFUGEES- AND- AND- AFGHAN AMERICANS- HERE AND IN THIS STATE ACTUALLY WON THE LARGEST TUBS IN THE- IN THE COUNTRY. I DO APPRECIATE THAT- THE STATE HAS ALSO- STEPPING UP AND WE'VE INCLUDED THIS BUDGET. FUNDING TO HELP THOSE REFUGEES AND- OTHER PEOPLE HAVE HELPED SUPPORTED OUR OUR TROOPS IN AFGHANISTAN AND- AND THAT- WE WILL- TRY TO WELCOME THEM AND PROVIDE THEM THE SUPPORT THEY NEED- STATE AND TRY TO SALVAGE AND YOU LIVE HERE IN. OUR COUNTRY AND PARTICULARLY HERE IN CALIFORNIA CERTAINLY MANY OTHER EXCELLENT THINGS AND THIS- BUDGET AS WELL BUT I DID WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THESE PARTICULAR ITEMS SO I URGE AN I. VOTED ON SB ONE SEVENTY THANK YOU. SENATOR I. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT WE SHOULD HAVE A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF THE IMPACTS ECONOMIC IMPACTS AS WELL AS THE CLIMATE IMPACTS OF WHAT WE'RE GOING TO RIGHT NOW. I WANT TO THANK THE STAFF FOR ALL THE- THE CHAIRS IN THE BAY HI- FOR A GREEN TO HOW ROAD LAW IN ECONOMIC RESILIENCE PROGRAM I THINK THAT'S A BIG STEP FOR. AND THIS IS ABOUT PRIORITY HIGH QUALITY JOBS AND EQUITABLE ACCESS TO THEM- WE WILL HAVE A REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE ARE% RELATED TO HIGH ROAD METRICS MEANING EQUITY JOB QUALITY AND SUSTAINABILITY JOB CREATION WAGES AND JOB RETENTION AND FRANKLY THAT'S WHAT WE SHOULD HAVE IN ALL OF OUR SPENDING AND GRANT PROGRAMS IF WE REALLY. ARE COMMITTED. TO A SUSTAINABLE INCLUSIVE WORKER CENTER. FAMILY CENTERED ECONOMY THAT WORKS FOR EVERYONE. LAST YEAR'S REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE ENTITLED PUTTING CALIFORNIA ON THE HIGH ROAD A JOBS AND CLIMATE ACTION PLAN FOR TWENTY THIRTY. EMPHASIZE THAT INVESTMENTS IN INFRASTRUCTURE ALONE. ALONE WILL NOT CREATE HIGH QUALITY QUALITY JOBS WE NEED TO INCENTIVIZE BOTH THE SUPPLY AND THE DEMAND SIDE. IN ORDER TO CREATE HIGH ROAD FAMILY SUSTAINED SUSTAINING JOBS AND MAKING SURE THAT THERE IS THE TRAINING NECESSARY FOR THESE MEN AND WOMEN TO BE SUCCESSFUL ON THE JOB SO. THE COMPLEMENTING COLLUSION OF THE HIGH ROAD LANGUAGE AND- I THINK AS WE MOVE FORWARD ON THIS INVESTMENT IN THE CLIMATE CRISIS. THAT WE NEED TO BE MORE EXPLICIT ABOUT THE CONNECTION BETWEEN JOBS AND THAT CLIMATE ACTION PLAN THANK YOU. IS THERE ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE SENATOR NELSON. NOT A PRESIDENT LADIES AND GENTLEMAN SAID THAT WE DO NEED TO MOVE ALONG WITH THE BUDGET I AM GONNA LAY OFF ON THIS ONE AS WELL IN PART BECAUSE OF PROCESS. AND THE FACT THAT WE'RE NOT I'M NOT REALLY CLEAR AS MUCH AS I'D LIKE TO BE AS WHAT IS GOING TO BE IN IT AND WHAT THE LONG TERM OBLIGATIONS ARE I WILL NOTE THAT. THE BUDGET DOES. THE EXPANDED LONG TERM OBLIGATIONS OF NATION BUILDING OF THE BUDGET WHICH WILL AFFECT US IN THE FUTURE. BUT THAT'S NOT THE ITEM AT HAND RIGHT NOW I'M JUST SAYING THAT I AM NOT TO. SUFFICIENTLY CONVINCED THAT IT'S THIS IS THE RIGHT BILL THERE WILL BE SOME OF THE BUDGET BILLS THAT I WILL SUPPORT THERE WILL BE SOME THAT I DO NOT SUPPORT. THIS ONE I'M GOING TO STAND FOR NOW. SENATOR BATES. QUESTION FOR THE AUTHOR PLEASE WOULD YOU ACCEPT A QUESTION SHE WAS. HI IN OUR ANALYSIS IS NOT A REAL SPECIFICITY ON WHAT OF THE CLEARLY CLOSE TO ONE BILLION DOLLARS IT'S GOING FOR FROM WILDFIRES AND I THINK THAT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT YOU KNOW WE'VE ALL EXPERIENCED REMOTELY EXCEPT THE GOOD SENATOR FROM SENATOR SENATOR FROM BEAVER. AND WHAT HAMPERED SOME OF THE EFFORTS ARE A LOT OF THE EFFORTS IS THAT THE HELICOPTERS COULD NOT FLY WITH THE INTENT OF SMOKE SO THIS IS A SPECIFIC ASKED IN TERMS OF THE ROMANIAN THERE FOR- PURCHASING HELICOPTERS THAT ARE ADVANCING CAN ACTUALLY DO THAT JOHN. THOSE ARE THINGS THAT I KNOW WHEN WE GET TO OUR DISTRICT WILL BE SPECIFIC QUESTIONS JUST WHAT IS GOING FOR ON THAT PARTICULAR PROBLEM AND CERTAINLY ALL THE PROJECTS THAT THE SENATOR FROM. BEAVER MANSIONS DO WE HAVE A TIME LINE ON ALL WHEN THEY'RE GOING TO BECOME. YEAH. IN THE JUNE BUDGET ACTION THAT WAS UNRELATED TO. WE DID MONEY FOR HELLO YOU HAVE SO THERE WERE A IS MONEY IN- IN THAT BUDGET NOW IN THE WILDFIRE ADDITIONAL WILDFIRE MONIES WE HAVE BEFORE US TODAY WHICH AUGMENTS THE EARLY ACTION ONES. WHILE DATE IN MOST CASES DO NOT SPECIFY THE PARTICULAR PROJECTS FOR EXAMPLE THAT OUR COLLEAGUE FROM- A BEAVER REFERENCED ON IT THEY FIND THE CONSERVANCY'S WHO CAN IN TURN FUND THOSE PROJECTS. ARENDT IT ALSO OF COURSE FINDS CAL FIRE AND THE- OTHER CONSERVATION CORES AND SUCH THAT ARE EITHER DOING THE WORK OF THE- CREATING A BUFFER ZONES AND SUCH OR FIGHTING THE FIRES RIGHT NOW. THANK YOU FOR THAT ON MY OWN TIME MEMBERS I THINK THE DIFFICULTY THAT WE HAVE IN EXPLAINING WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE. WITH THE MONEY THAT THE PROCREATIVE NEEDS VERY VERY IMPORTANT AREAS BEING ABLE TO SAY WE'RE GOING TO DO X. Y. AND Z. AND IT'S GOING TO BE DELIVERED ON A CERTAIN TIME. BECAUSE OFTEN NOW- WE HAVE DONALD HILL SO MUCH WORK DONE APPRECIATE THAT BUT FOR US INDIVIDUALLY SINCE WE HAVE NOT BEEN DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN THE NEGOTIATIONS ARE PUT THIS ALL TOGETHER IT'S DIFFICULT TO ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS THAT WE GET FROM PEOPLE WHO HAVE SUFFERED THE SEVERE DAMAGE SO I'M JUST SAYING GOING FORWARD. IT WOULD BE HELPFUL IF WE GET MORE OF LINE ITEMS THAT ARE UNDER CONSIDERATION THOSE ARE THINGS THAT WE CAN BE DISCUSSING ENOUGH. IN THE FUTURE SESSIONS BUT I THINK WE'RE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT IN ACCOUNTABILITY- TO THE PEOPLE OF OUR STATE WHO HAVE REALLY SUFFERED SO MANY OF THESE HORRIBLE ON CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS SO THANK YOU BUT TANK YOU FOR YOUR- WORK I KNOW IT'S BEEN A- LONG HARD. JOURNEY. TO TODAY AND WE DO APPRECIATE THAT. SENATOR MCGUIRE. THANK YOU SO MUCH BETTER PRESIDENT AND MEMBERS- FIRST AND FOREMOST I DON'T RISE OFTEN TO BE ABLE TO TALK ON THE FLOOR BUT I WANTED TO BE ABLE TO TALK SPECIFICALLY ABOUT CLIMATE. IN WILDFIRE. ALONG WITH THE GOOD SENATOR FROM BEAVER. AND SO MANY IN THIS CHAMBER. WE'VE BEEN HIT INCREDIBLY HARD. BY A SEVERITY WILDFIRES. LAKE COUNTY FOR EXAMPLE IN THE GREAT NORTH COAST IS THE FIRST COUNTY WHERE NEARLY TWO THIRDS OF ITS ENTIRE LANDMASS IS NOW BURNED SINCE. TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN. THE ALARM IN THE STATE COULD NOT BE LOUDER. THE CLIMATE CRISIS IS NOT HYPOTHETICAL IT'S HERE. AND WE SEE EVIDENCE ALL AROUND US. HUNDREDS OF SCIENTISTS WITH THE UNITED NATIONS INTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE AGREE. WE WILL SEE AN AVERAGE TEMPERATURE INCREASE OF ONE AND A HALF DEGREES CELSIUS UNLESS WE TAKE IMMEDIATE ACTION. AND IN FACT CALIFORNIA IS THAT CANARY IN THE COAL MINE FOR NORTH AMERICA. HERE IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA NORTHERN CALIFORNIA FORESTS WERE ALREADY SEEN AN INCREASE. IN TEMPERATURES. IN THE HOTTEST MONTHS AND INTO THE FALL YOU TALK WITH GRIZZLED CAL FIRE VETERANS WHO'VE BEEN ON THE FIRE LINES FOR THIRTY FORTY YEARS. THEY'RE SEEING A CHANGE IN FIRE BEHAVIOR WHAT IS WORKED OVER THE PAST FEW DECADES IN CALIFORNIA IN THE WEST NO LONGER WORKS BECAUSE OF THE SEVERITY OF THE CRISIS AT HAND. CALIFORNIA'S FIRE SEASON HAS EXPLODED IN THE LAST DECADE. MORE THAN FOUR MILLION ACRES 4% OF THE ENTIRE LAND MASS OF THE GOLDEN STATE HAS BURNED IN JUST ONE RECORD SETTING YEAR AND THAT WAS LAST YEAR. THE NUMBER OF DRY WARM AND WINDY DAYS IN THE FALL IN CALIFORNIA DOUBLED SINCE THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES AND WELL WE HAVE TAKEN SIGNIFICANT STEPS WE KNOW THAT THERE IS MORE TO DO. BUT SOMETIMES I FEEL LIKE IN THIS BUILDING IN PARTICULAR. WE TALK ABOUT WHAT HAVE YOU DONE FOR ME LATELY. BUT I JUST WANT TO BRING ATTENTION TO WHAT. THIS CHAMBER ON A BIPARTISAN BASIS ALONG WITH THE GOVERNOR HAS DONE. TODAY THIS THREE POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS IT'S BEEN LED BY THE STATE SENATE. WITH LEADERS IN THESE CHAMBERS. AND IT'S THE NEXT THREE YEARS ARE GOING TO HELP US CONTINUE TO LEAD NORTH AMERICA ON THE ISSUE OF THE CLIMATE CRISIS IN IT'S BEEN ED WITH FOLKS LIKE PROTEIN MACHEN'S. THIS LEGISLATION IS GOING TO CHANGE THE WAY THAT WE APPROACH. THE CLIMATE CRISIS HOW WE FIGHT IT HOW WE ADAPT HOW WE WORK. AND HOW WE MOVE OUR COMMUNITIES FORWARD. THIS BUDGET IS WE'VE HEARD OTHER MEMBERS SAY REPRESENTS THE SINGLE LARGEST INVESTMENT IN CLIMATE RESILIENCY IN THE HISTORY OF THE GOLDEN STATE. ANY INCLUDES DOZENS OF PRIORITIES THAT WORKING FAMILIES UP AND DOWN THIS COAST DESPERATELY NEED. I WANT TO TALK FINALLY THE PRESIDENT ON THE ISSUE OF SCIENCE. IF YOU LOOK AT THE AVERAGE ACRES BURNED OVER THE LAST TWENTY YEARS IT WAS ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND. PER YEAR. IF YOU LOOK AT JUST THE LAST FIVE YEARS IN CALIFORNIA WE'VE GONE FROM EIGHT HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND ACRES PER YEAR TO NEARLY ONE POINT SIX MILLION ACRES PER YEAR. WHAT WE DID THIS YEAR. IT'S HISTORIC BUT WE KNOW IT NEEDS TO BECOME THE NORM. WE HAVE INVESTED A HUNDRED AND FIFTY FIVE MILLION FOR FOREST HEALTH FOR FOREST THINNING DEAD AND DYING TREE MOVE ON WILDFIRE FUEL BREAKS A HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILLION FOR A WHILE FOR ME TO GREET MITIGATION GRANTS. AT NEARLY FOURTEEN ADDITIONAL CALIFORNIA CONSERVATION CREWS ARE NOW ON THE LINE STARTING FIRING THINNING FORESTS FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS HAS BEEN ALLOCATED TO THE NATIONAL GUARD TO BE ABLE TO ESTABLISH MORE HAND CREWS TO BRING THEM FROM SIX MONTHS TO TEN MONTHS. WE HAVE PURCHASED SEVEN C. ONE THIRTY CARGO PLANES FROM THE COAST GUARD THAT WE'RE GONNA BE DEPLOYING IN ALL CORNERS OF THIS GREAT STATE IN THE YEARS TO COME. TWELVE BLACK HAWK HELICOPTERS HAVE NOW BEEN PURCHASED BY THE STATE BY THE WAY FIVER NOW IN STATE FIGHTING FIRES NOT JUST DURING THE DAY BUT FINALLY FIGHTING FIRES AT NIGHT. WHETHER IT'S THE CALENDAR FIRE. OR THE FIRES IN THE NORTH BAY. I JUST WANT TO END IT RIGHT HERE. THIS WOULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED WITHOUT THE BUDGET SET TO CHAIR NO ONE ACKNOWLEDGED HIM. FROM FREMONT FOR ALL THIS WORK. THE GREAT BUDGET YEAR THAT WE HAVE. AND HONESTLY WITHOUT REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS WORKING TOGETHER. THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT WE CAN ALL AGREE UPON. BUT WE GOT A LOT OF WORK TO DO. AND I KNOW WHETHER YOU ARE LIVING IN BEAVER OR YOU'RE LIVING IN LAKE COUNTY. WE HAVE TO FOCUS ON THE CRISIS AT HAND. WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO INVEST IN THIS ISN'T JUST A STATE PROBLEM WHETHER IT'S A REPUBLICAN ADMINISTRATION OR DEMOCRATIC ADMINISTRATIONTHE WHITE HOUSE THE FOREST SERVICE HAS TO GET THEIR ACT TOGETHER. AND START FOR KENTUCKY SEEN ON THE 57% OF THE LAND IN THIS NATION IN THIS STATE THAT IS OWNED AND MANAGED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. AND THAT'S AN ISSUE FOR DONALD TRUMP IN JOE BIDEN COMBINED. I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU TO JOIN ROY. THANK YOU JAMES HACKER THANK YOU TO KEEP LIVER THESE THREE IN OUR ALL SENATE STAFF AND THEY'VE BEEN WORKING DAY AND NIGHT TO BE ABLE TO HELP DELIVER THIS PACKAGE ALONG WITH THE CARD I MEAN OF COURSE IS WELL FROM THE PROTEINS F. AS IN OF COURSE PROTEIN MACHEN'S I DO I THINK WE OWE THEM A DEBT OF GRATITUDE AND A THANK YOU AND MADAM PRESIDENT I'M SORRY TO GO ON SO LONG BUT LOOK FOR THIS. SEGMENT CONTINUED TO LEAD THE NATION WHEN IT COMES TO INVESTING TO COMBAT OUR CLIMATE CRISIS. SENATOR SKINNER WOULD YOU LIKE TO ADOPT THAT IS YOUR CLOSING. ACTUALLY NO BUT I DO APPRECIATE AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT I'M CALLING FROM HEALDSBURG GAVE THAT THANKS TO THE STAFF AND THEIR OTHER STUFF YOU DIDN'T MENTION BUT THEY DO I MEAN THIS AS OUR US SENATOR FROM- AN APOLOGY- HIS FATE AND I'M NOT RECALLING EXACTLY THE CITY THAT YOU REPRESENT LIKE UNITY GAL. REFERENCED THIS. YOU KNOW WHAT I HAVE MENTIONED THAT THIS IS THE LARGEST INVESTMENT. IN IT'S ARGUABLY THE LARGEST INVESTMENT IN OUR- GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS REDUCTION PROGRAMS BUT IT DEFINITELY IN OUR CLIMATERESILIENCY IS ALSO KNOWN AS CLIMATE ADAPTATION PROGRAMS BUT IT'S ALSO THE LARGEST BUDGET THIS IS STATE IS EVER EVER ADOPTED. AND IT'S COMPLEX IT'S A LOT OF MONEY AND THE STAFF HAVE BEEN WORKING THEIR TAILS OFF SINCE BEFORE JANUARY AND YOU CAN THINK WELL WHY BEFORE JANUARY SINCE THE GOVERNOR ONLY INTRODUCED THAT BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO BE PREPARED THE- L. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND OTHERS GIVE YOU THE REVENUE PROJECTIONS AND SUCH BACK THEN AND SO YOU START WORKING THEN AND THEN YOU WORK FURTHER. ONCE THE GOVERNOR IN TRADUCIDA JANUARY BUDGET AND THEN YOU WORK EVEN FURTHER AS WE HOLD ALL OUR HEARINGS AND DEVELOP IT AND THE REST OF IT SO THEY DO DESERVE INCREDIBLE THANKS BECAUSE THEY HAVE WORKED VERY HARD AND I WILL NOT TRY TO SAY ALL OF THEIR NAMES BECAUSE I DO NOT WANT TO MISS ANYONE BUT THERE ARE MANY NOT ONLY IN BUDGET STUFF BUT- POLICY COMMITTEES THE PROTEIN STAFF MANY OF YOUR PERSONAL STAFF AND OF COURSE ALL THE MEMBERS WHO WORKED ON IT. BUT WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO JUST COME IN ON VERY BRIEFLY IS THAT. THAT'S MEMBERS AS WE AS OUR COLLEAGUES HAVE MADE REALLY GOOD. FLOOR REMARKS ON WHAT'S BEFORE US. MY DAUGHTER SENT ME A PHOTO. OF MY NEW GRAND BABY WAS THREE MONTHS TODAY. THAT GRAND BABY. LIVES IN AN AREA. THAT IS HIGHLY IMPACTED. BY AIR AND CLIMATE POLLUTING EMISSIONS FROM GOODS MOVEMENT. TRUCK SANTA TRAIN. FROM A REFINERY. SHE ALSO LIVES IN CALIFORNIA SO THAT MEANS LIKE ALL OF US SHOULD BE SUBJECTED TO FIRE ANY DAY. HE ALSO LIVES. IN A GLOBE THAT WE HAVE POLLUTED TO THE POINT WHERE WE ARE IN THE CLIMATE CRISIS WARRANTS. AND I THINK ALL OF US NOT JUST FOR HER BUT FOR ALL OF OUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN. AND THEIR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN WANT TO DO OUR BEST TO REVERSE THE DAMAGE THAT WE'VE DONE. AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO WITH THIS BUDGET AND NO IT DOES NOT ADDRESS EVERYTHING NOR WILL IT REVERSE EVERYTHING. BUT IT IS SIGNIFICANT AND SIZEABLE AND WE SHOULD BE PROUD OF IT AND WE SHOULD RESIST ANYONE WHO TRIES TO TELL US THAT WE ARE NOT PUTTING OUR MONEY WHERE OUR MOUTH IS. YES WE COULD DO MORE AND NO IT WILL NOT REVERSE EVERYTHING AND WE HAVE TO CLOSELY FOLLOW THAT WHICH- IS IN WHAT WE'VE DIRECTED IF IT IS NOT. ACCOMPLISHING OUR INTENTIONS THAT WE MAKE REVISIONS NEXT YEAR AND ON THE ISSUES OF DO WE HAVE THE DETAILS OF HOW EACH OF THESE THINGS ARE GOING TO BE SPENT YET MANY OF THIS IS GRANT PROGRAMS AND WE HAVE THE RIGHT AND WE WILL RECEIVE. DETAILED BACK FROM THOSE GRANT PROGRAMS AS TO WHO THEY FIND IT ONWHAT THEY FIND IT. AND IF WE FEEL THAT IT WAS NOT DIRECTED IN THE WAYS THAT WE FEEL ARE APPROPRIATE THEN WE CAN ADD NEW CRITERIA A NEW- PARAMETERS BLIPS IN IN OUR FUTURE YEARS. SO I. FEEL I CAN NEVER DO ENOUGH FOR OUR MY GRAND BABY AND ARE ALL OF OUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN BUT I CERTAINLY FEEL THAT WE'RE DOING A LOT AND I CAN SLEEP BETTER AND WITH THAT I SP RIGHT.

OKAY MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE READ. SENATE BILL ONE FIFTY FIVE BY THE SENATE COMMITTEE ON BUDGET AND FISCAL REVIEW AND ACT RELATING TO PUBLIC RESOURCES IN MAKING APPROPRIATIONS AIRPORTS EXPECT IMMEDIATELY BILL RELATED TO THE BUDGET SENATOR SKINNER FORAGERS THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS SP ONE FIFTY FIVE IS THE TRAILER BILL TO IMPLEMENT THE RESOURCES THINGS WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING IT REQUIRES AN AGENCY TO ANNUALLY REPORT AND THIS IS WHERE WE WILL GET THE DATA AN EARLY REPORT ON ALL PROGRAMS RELATED. TO WILDFIRES IN FLORENCE RESILIENCE THAT THEY FUNDED PURSUANT TO OUR TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET ACT. UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY FIVE IT EXEMPTS FROM SEAPORT BIODIVERSITY PROJECTS THAT CONSERVE RESTORE FOR CHAPPED OR ASSIST IN THE RECOVERY OF CALIFORNIA NATIVE WHICH FISH SORRY DATE OF FISH AND WILDLIFE OR THEIR HABITATS UPON WHICH THEY DEPEND. NOW THIS EXEMPTION IS EXTREMELY LIMITED IN ITS APPLICATION IT DOES NOT APPLY TO THE DELTA CONVEYANCE PROJECT AND THERE IS NO LEGITIMACY TO THE CLAIM THAT THE DELTA CONVEYANCE PROJECT CAN USE THIS EXEMPTION THE DELTA CONVEYANCE IS ABOUT MOVING WATER IT IS NOT ABOUT RESTORING HABITAT AND IT DOES NOT MEET ANY OF THE CRITERIA. THAT IS SET FORTH IN THIS EXEMPTION. BUT BILL ALL EXTEND THE PROHIBITION OF COMMUNITY WATER SYSTEMS FROM CUTTING OFF THE WATER SERVICE TO CUSTOMERS. SO THAT- WHO WERE UNABLE TO PAY THEIR BILLS IT EXTENDS THAT TO THE END OF THIS YEAR. AND MEMBERS I ASK YOUR RIVALS. SENATOR NELSON. MADAM PRESIDENT LADIES AND GENTLEMEN THE SENATE THIS. THEY'LL HAVE A PARTICULARLY ONEROUS PROVISION IN IT. IT HAS A HISTORY AND I WON'T GO INTO IT AND TOO AWFUL MUCH DEPTH SEVERAL YEARS AGO A FORMER ADMINISTRATION. GAVE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS OF OUR BUDGET FOR THE REMOVAL OF FOUR DAMS ON THE KLAMATH RIVER. NOW SOME OF US HAVE A PROBLEM WITH JUST REMOVING DAMS PERIOD. BUT THERE ARE IMPLICATIONS TO THIS THAT ARE SIGNIFICANT. AND IT WOULD BE RELATED IN FACT TO THIS PARTICULAR BILL. NOW THAT OBLIGATION. IS EVEN GREATER. WHAT DO I NEED. I HAVE A LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL OPINION FROM EARLY SPRING THAT I REQUESTED. AND IF THESE DAMS ARE REMOVED THE ENORMOUS FED IMITATION BEHIND THOSE DAMS IS GONNA WORK. DOWNSTREAM. THEN OUT OF THE HUMBLE DAY PARTICULARLY. AND WHAT IS THAT GOING TO DO. TO THE FISH HABITAT. DISASTROUS THOSE ORGANIZATIONS WHO DEMANDED THAT WE REMOVE THOSE DAMS. I WONDER WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO SAY. WHEN ALL OF THAT HABITAT. FOR THE FISH BREEDING. AND SPAWNING IS DESTROYED. I GUESS I'LL PROBABLY SAY NOTHING. BUT IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO NOTE THE LEDGE COUNCIL OPINION FURTHER EMPHASIZED THAT THE CITIZENS OF CALIFORNIA. IF THERE ARE ANY LAWSUITS PURSUANT TO THE MOVIES AND DANCE AND THE IMPACT THERE FROM. TEXAS CALIFORNIA ARE GOING TO BE RESPONSIBLE. FOR THAT. NOW WE ALREADY HAVE. CASE LAW. THE- BLIGE'S STATE OBLIGATION FOR LANDS THAT ARE FLOODED. THAT'S BEEN A QUIET ISSUE MOST PEOPLE DON'T TALK ABOUT THAT IT'S VERY REAL AND VERY REAL IN WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH HERE. IN THIS LEGISLATION THE REMOVAL OF THE VAN. I STILL ARGUE WITH BAD POLICY. AND I WANTED TO GIVE YOU THE CONTEXT OF THIS SEGMENTATION. TWENTY MILLION CUBIC YARDS. NO THAT WOULD BE A PRODUCT OF ONE DUMP TRUCK. EVERY MINUTE. EVERY DAY FOR SIX YEARS. THAT'S WHAT WOULD BE EXPECTED AND THAT'S NOT EVEN THE HIGH PROJECTION. THE SEDIMENTATION ACCUMULATED OVER DECADES BEHIND THOSE. SO THAT IS GOING TO AFFECT. OUR NORTHERN COUNTIES. WHAT DOES THIS HELP WELL ONE PARTICULAR. VERY WEALTHY GENTLEMAN. IN HIS CORPORATION ACQUIRED THESE DAMS FOR POWER YEARS AGO. PROVED TO NOT LEAD TO THE INVESTMENT. BUT NOW THAT ENDED IS GOING TO TRY GREAT. FROM WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE WITH BILL. SO I WILL BE NO ON THIS LEGISLATION HAS A STATEMENT. NUMBER ONE ABOUT POLICY REMOVING THEM WE DON'T NEED TO BE REMOVING THE NEED TO BE CONSTRUCTING AT LEAST ONE THAT WE'VE GOT MONEY IN THE- BUDGETED FOR BY THE VOTERS OF CALIFORNIA SEVERAL YEARS AGO. THAT HASN'T GONE ANYWHERE IN SEVEN YEARS. AND MAY NOT IN ANOTHER SIX YEARS BEFORE WILL STORE ANY WATER. IN THAT ONE DAY. SO FOR THIS PARTICULAR BILL I WOULD URGE AND I A NOBLE. SENATOR DOLLY. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS I. ALL RIGHTS TO TALK ABOUT THE SAME ISSUE AS MY FRIEND FROM TO HIM I ACTUALLY REPRESENT. SISKIYOU COUNTY AND THE DAMS THAT ARE GONNA BE REMOVED I'M GONNA GO A LITTLE MORE DEPTH SO YOU'LL UNDERSTAND WHAT'S BEING PROPOSED HERE. WHAT'S BEING PROPOSED IS THAT. FIRST OF ALL I WANT YOU DON'T KNOW WARREN BUFFETT OWNS THESE DAMS HE'S WEALTHY. GOT PLENTY OF MONEY. AND BEHIND THESE DAMS AS MERCURY THERE'S ARSENIC THERE'S ALL KINDS OF THINGS IS GOING TO BE RELEASED AS WE TEAR THESE DAMS DOWN NOW THE FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION HAS DONE A STUDY TO HEAR THESE DAMS DOWN. OUR TAX DOLLARS IN THE STATE HAVE BEEN. ALLOCATED SOME OF THEM FOR THIS PROJECT AND THE RATE PAYERS HAVE PUT UP SOME OF THE MONEY AS WELL. HEY REGARDLESS IF YOU ARE FOR DAMS ARE NOT DAMS MAKES NO DIFFERENCE IN THIS CASE BECAUSE- WHAT WE'RE DOING IS WE'RE GIVING THEM A SEQUEL A- EXEMPTION. FOR ALL OF YOU WHO. CARE ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT. AND WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ABIDE BY OUR LAWS IN CALIFORNIA WHICH IS THE SEQUEL LAW WHICH ALLOWS YOU TO ENGAGE. WHEN SOMETHING'S GOING TO HAPPEN AND IF IT'S NOT MITIGATED PROPERLY YOU HAVE A STAKE IN THE GAME THIS BILL. WILL ALLOW SECRET TO BE WAIVED JUST LIKE WE WOULD DO. FOR SOMEBODY WANTS A SPORTS ARENA IN SACRAMENTO. MIND YOU THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF MILES OF RIVER BELOW THESE DAMS THAT. NOBODY'S GONNA BE ABLE TO COMMENT ON. OTHER THAN THE PROCESS THEY WENT THROUGH AT THE FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION. SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE RESISTANCE THERE WERE SOME. TALK ABOUT YOU KNOW ONE PARTY HELPING OUT BIG BUSINESS OR THE OTHER PARTY HELPING OUT BIG BUSINESS WELL IN THIS CASE IF YOU VOTE FOR THIS BILL YOUR HELP IN WARREN BUFFET OUT AND YOU'RE PENALIZING. EVERYBODY IN SISKIYOU COUNTY THAT WANTS TO HAVE A STAKE. ENGINE FIGURING OUT WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN WHEN THEY TEAR THESE DAMS DOWN THE COUNTY DOESN'T DEAR YOU'RE WAVING THEIR RIGHT. BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT GONNA HAVE THE SEQUEL OPTION. TO PROTEST HOW OR SEE A PLAN FOR HOW THESE GAMES ARE GOING TO COME DOWN. SO I JUST WANT YOU TO BE AWARE I KNOW MOST PEOPLE PROBABLY DON'T KNOW THAT'S IN THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION BUT IT'S IN THERE. AND IT'S GONNA MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE. TO MY DISTRICT AND IT'S ALSO GOING TO MAKE A HUGE DISTRICT. TO THE CENTER FOR HILLSBOROUGH. WHICH THE RIVER RUNS THROUGH. AND INTO. THE HUMBOLDT BAY. SO FOR THOSE REASONS I'LL BE OPPOSING THIS BILL THEY SHOULD NOT EVEN BE IN THIS. A PIECE OF LEGISLATION BUT IT IS SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK A NO VOTE ON SB ONE FIVE FIVE. SENATOR HER DAUGHTER. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I RISE TODAY WITH SOME CONCERNS REGARDING AB ONE FIFTY FIVE WELL THIS TRAILER BILL DOES INCLUDE IMPORTANT FUNDING TO ADDRESS EXTREME HE AND COMMUNITY RESILIENCE ISSUES I HAVE BEEN WORKING ON TO ADDRESS IN MY COMMUNITY AND OTHERS SINCE I STARTED HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE CONCERT WITH THE PAY INCREASE THE BILL PROVIDES TO PUBLIC UTILITY. COMMISSION MEMBERS UP AT A TIME WHEN SIGNIFICANT POTENTIAL RATE INCREASES ARE BEING CONSIDERED UPWARDS OF 26% AND WHEN PEOPLE ARE ALREADY STRUGGLING TO MEET SKYROCKETING ENERGY COSTS I'M NOT SURE WE SHOULD BE PROVIDING THE PC COMMISSION MEMBERS WITH THE SALARY INCREASE OUTLINED IN THIS BILL- BUT- STILL. FOR THIS REASON I. WILL RELUCTANTLY- SUPPORT SUPPORT THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION TODAY OR BY THE TRAILER BILL THANK YOU. THERE ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE YES SENATOR JOHNSON. AMERICA WANTED TO RISE A DISCUSS ONE PARTICULAR PART OF SP ONE FIFTY FIVE THAT I HAVE SOME CONCERNS OVER AND IT'S THE ALAMEDA TESLA EXPANSION AREA FOR THE- H. V. PARK OF CARNEGIE- HV PARK AND- YOU KNOW I DON'T. I UNDERSTAND AND TRUST THE SINCERITY OF THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND THE SENATOR THAT REPRESENT THIS AREA. IN TRYING TO FIND A SOLUTION FOR- THEIR DISTRICTS ON- SOME OF THEIR CONSTITUENTS THEY DON'T WANT THIS SO H. V. PARK- TO BE EXPANDED AND OR OPENED. BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS- THIS LAND WAS PURCHASED IN NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT FOR NINE MILLION DOLLARS. FOR THE PURPOSE OF BECOMING AN O. H. V. PARK AND TO EXPAND CARNEGIE- SIRVA. AND I DO APPRECIATE I'M NOTICING HERE THAT THERE'S OVER THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS BEING TRANSFERRED FROM THE GENERAL FUND TO. THE PARKS DEPARTMENT ONE MILLION DOLLARS OF THAT FROM THE GENERAL FUND OF PARKS FOR THE PURPOSE OF. DESIGNATING- THE BILL WOULD PROHIBIT THE LAND FROM BECOMING DOESN'T IT IS A STATE VEHICLE RECREATION PARK BUT THEN ALSO FIND YOU KNOW THE BEST USE FOR IT. AND THEN TWENTY NINE POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS IN THE GENERAL FUND J. O. H. B. TRUST FUND FOR PARKS TO ACQUIRE AND DEVELOP PROPERTIES TO EXPAND OHB RESTORATION WHICH HAS BEEN. PRESENTED AS A AS A POTENTIAL SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM AND I WOULD AGREE THAT THAT WOULD BE A POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS PROBLEM IF. WE COULD TRUST THAT THERE WOULD BE APPROPRIATE LAND FOUND. AND ACQUIRED BY THE STATE AND THEN ALLOWED TO ACTUALLY BE BUILT AS AN O. H. V. PARK I WOULD RECKON I WOULD WELCOME THAT MY AREA OR SOMEWHERE ELSE. IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA BUT I THINK IT WOULD BE VERY NAIVE OF ANY OF US TO THINK HERE ON THIS FLOOR TODAY. THAT WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL PRESSURES THAT ARE PUT ON THE LEGISLATORS HERE IN SACRAMENTO THAT WE WOULD EVER GET. ENVIRONMENTAL CLEARANCE TO EXPAND ANOTHER ALWAYS V. PARK SOMEWHERE ELSE IN THE STATE- SO WHAT THOSE CONCERNS I WILL BE VOTING NO TODAY ON THIS BILL- THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. FEDERICO MAN YES MA'AM YES MA'AM PRESENT THANK YOU I. RISE IN SUPPORT OF SB ONE FIFTY FIVE I WANT TO SHARE SOME COMMON. SOME OR RESPOND TO SOME OF THE COMMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN BEEN MADE ENOUGH THAT I GET UP AND TALK ABOUT. A SEQUEL EXEMPTION THERE'S ALREADY BEEN A FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT FOR THE LOWER. KLAMATH RIVER WE'RE JUST SAYING THAT IT SATISFIES SEQUEL REQUIREMENTS SO THAT. ALL THE NERVOUS NOW HE'S IN THE ROOM WILL UNDERSTAND IT IT'S THE ENVIRONMENTAL WORK HAS BEEN DONE AND HAS BEEN. STEADY FOR A LONG TIME. YOU KNOW IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR BROWN HOSTED A CLIMATE GLOBAL CLIMATE CONFERENCE IN SAN FRANCISCO AND I ATTENDED THAT. AND THEY HAD AN EXHIBIT- THAT INVOLVE THE ALAMEDA CREEK AND THAT'S THE LARGEST TRIBUTARY THAT FEEDS INTO- THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AND THEY HAVE A PLAN THAT THEY'RE GOING TO REMOVE THE CEMENT IN THE- END THAT WAS PUT IN BY THE- ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS TO ALLOW THE NATIONAL. NATURAL FLUSHING OF THE CREEK THE RIVER INTO SAN FRANCISCO BAY AM I HAVING AND THIS OCCURS DURING EXTREME. STORM CONDITIONS AND THEY'RE SAYING THAT HISTORICALLY THE WATER WITH THE SENTIMENT WOULD RUSH INTO THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AND NATURALLY SETTLE IN THE LOW PLANTS AND THEY'RE- ANTICIPATING THE DEATH THE CONSEQUENCE WOULD BE THAT ONE FOOT OF SEA LEVEL RISE WOULD BE MITIGATED. BY THE BY RETURNING THE NATURAL FLOW OF THE SETTLEMENT. YOU KNOW THE ENVIRONMENTALISTS AND THE FOLKS HYDROLOGISTS HAVE HAVE STUDIED THE UPPER KLAMATH RIVER AND I THINK THE SCIENCE IS STILL OUT. YES WHEN YOU HAVE AN EXTREME WEATHER CONDITION ALL THE LEGACY OF MERCURY TO TEN EVERYWHERE FOR KIDS. MOVES AROUND AND IT RE SETTLES BUT THE HOPE IS THAT THE NATURAL FLUSH WILL GO OUT TO THE HUMBOLDT BAY AND LIKE IT DOES% IN THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY RESETTLED THERE NATURALLY AND HELP DESK AREA WHEN THEY HAVE C. LEVEL RISE. SO THOSE REPORTS WILL BECOME THAT INFORMATIONAL BECOMING COMING FORWARD THERE'S A LOT OF GOOD THINGS HERE AND- THE TESLA PARK IS THE SIERRA CLUB'S NUMBER ONE ASK FOLKS TO SIT HERE THROUGH ALL THE BUDGET STUFF ALL THE STUFF WE DID ON CLIMATE. THEY'RE ASKING FOR TESLA PARK IN ALL RIGHT MY STAFF HAS RECEIVED INFORMATION OR REQUESTS FROM EXISTING OFF ROAD VEHICLE PARTS THAT WANT TO DO EXPANSIONS THEY WANT TO TAKE THAT TWENTY NINE MILLION DOLLARS INTO THE EXPANSION. SO LET'S NOT FORGET THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION THIS BILL FOR COASTAL CONSERVANCY LET'S NOT FORGET THE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION FOR EXTREME HEAT. LET'S NOT IN THE END- FORGET THE I. CARPET IS GOING TO DO A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AND COMMUNITY RESILIENCY AND ALSO THE- CARBON NEGATIVES IN ABOUT- THE FUNDING THAT SIT THERE. I HEARD TONIGHT PHOTO AND I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH EVERYBODY NEXT YEAR ON IMPROVING AND OTHER RESOURCES BUILT. SENATOR ALAN. MEMBERS I WANT TO RISE IN SUPPORT OF SB ONE FIFTY FIVE AS WELL- YOU KNOW I WANT TO I DO WANT TO ALSO JUST SPEAK ON BEHALF OF SUPPORT FOR CONSERVANCIES- IN THE END OF THE DAY THERE IS DEDICATED FUND OF CONSERVANCIES IN THERE'S LOTS OF THINGS THAT. THAT- YEAH I HEAR I HEAR WHAT PEOPLE BEEN SAYING I WILL SAY THE CONSERVATIVES ARE PROVEN PROGRAMS THAT SHOWN TIME AND TIME AGAIN. THAT THEY CAN GET THE MONEY OUT QUICKLY AND EFFICIENTLY- YOU KNOW WE FROM MY PERSPECTIVE I ABSOLUTELY WANT TO SEE MORE MONEY- FOR CONSERVATIVES IN THE OUT YEARS I THINK WE ALSO. HAVE ONE OF THEIR ISSUES COME UP. AS WE LIKE TO SEE SOME DEDICATED FUNDING TO ENSURE THAT MUSEUMS AND CULTURAL CENTERS. CAN CONTINUE TO BE EFFECTIVE PARTNERS. IN OUR CLIMATE EFFORTS AND THEY CAN ALSO GET THE SUPPORT THEY NEED TO HARDEN. THEIR BUILDINGS HAVE BECOME MORE RESILIENT. AS I CERTAINLY HOPE TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH OUR PARTNERS IN THE BUDGET COMMITTEE TO SEE IF WE CAN GET THOSE THE SOURCES FUNDED BUT THERE'S- THIS IS A- THIS IS. THIS THIS BILL REPRESENTS A REALLY STORAGE INVESTMENT- AND THERE'S MUCH TO BE PROUD OF AND I URGE I HAVE A- IS THERE ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. DISCUSSION OR DEBATE SAYING NONE.

THE PRIVATE DEVELOPED APARTMENT HOW MANY COMPLAINTS ARE YOU STILL GETTING FROM YOUR CONSTITUENTS ABOUT DDD AND HAS IT BEEN FIXED NOW THAT HAS NOT BEEN FIXED MAYBE SOME OF THE LEGISLATION THAT WILL FINALLY GET OUT OF THIS LEGISLATURE WILL DO A LITTLE BIT.

CENTER SKINNER THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS EIGHT SP ONE SIXTY SIX IS OUR CANNABIS BUDGET TRAILER BILL. AND IT- WE ACTED IN JUNE AND PROVIDED THIRTY MILLION TO IMPLEMENT CANNABIS LICENSING FEE WAIVERS AND DEFERRALS CONTINGENT UPON THE ADOPTION OF FUTURE LANGUAGE AND THIS IS THE LANGUAGE THAT WE WOULD NEED TO SPEND THAT MONEY. SO IT SET THE PARAMETERS FOR LICENSING FEE WAIVERS AND DEFERRALS BY CREATING A STATEWIDE DEFINITION FOR EQUITY APPLICANTS AND LICENSEES THAT WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR THE LICENSE THING BE WAIVERS AND DEFERRALS. AND WITH THAT I ASK FOR YOUR VOTE. IS THERE ANY DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM SENATOR BRADFORD. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR ON PRESIDENT I WANT TO THINK OF THE PROTIUM STAFF CREDIBLE. BUDGET STAFF ARE PUT TO CHEER. IN ALL THEIR RESPECTIVE STAFF FOR WORKING ON A B. ONE SIX SIX. IT'S BEEN REALLY ENCOURAGING AND- A REASSURING. TO WORK WITH THIS TEAM AND TO WORK ON THE CONTENTS OF THIS CAMPUS EQUITY FEE WAIVER AND DEFERRAL PROGRAM AS WE ALL KNOW THIS IS A PROGRAM THAT IS NOW. WE ARE ALL THIRTY FIVE NINE FIVE TWO YEARS AGO BUT THERE WAS NO MONEY IN THE PROGRAM AND THE ONE THING THAT WE'VE SEEN OVER THE LAST YEAR AND A HALF YEARS SINCE HIS CANNABIS MARKET IS. TAKEN FLIGHT IS THE LACK OF WOMEN. MINORITIES ARE DISABLED VETERANS IN THE SPACE AND THEY'RE- WANTING TO BE HERE EVERY DAY SO I WANT TO THANK THEM FOR WORKING WITH ME AND SHOW ME THAT YOU. REALLY HEARD THE CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN EXPRESSED- BY ME BY CONSTITUENTS IN MY DISTRICT BY PEOPLE WHO LOOK LIKE ME IN NINETEEN. NOT ONLY ARE HEARD ME BUT YOU WERE TRULY LISTENING.

AND TWO YEARS LATER- WITH AFTER WE PASS WE FINALLY A FINAL VOTE HAVE FUNDING. AND I'VE TALKED TO A FEW FUN THIS FEE WAIVER PROGRAM IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET SO I APPRECIATE THIS- THIS TRAILER BILL SPECIFIES THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN CONVICTED OR ARRESTED WITH CANNABIS VIOLATIONS CAN QUALIFY FOR FEE WAIVERS AND DEFERRALS THE REASONS ARE OBVIOUS TO ANYONE WHO KNOWS THE REAL HISTORY ON THE WAR ON DRUGS WHY THIS IS SO IMPORTANT. PEOPLE'S HOUSEHOLD INCOME IS CAN ALSO QUALIFY THEIR INCOME WOULD BE OF INCOME WITH OTHER. WISE WE TOO MUCH. OR TOO HARD TO SAY FOR THEM TO COMPETE IN THIS RICH MAN'S BUSINESS WHETHER ANY HELP THIS IS CRITICALLY NEEDED.

TWELVE CLEANER TRAILER BILL AND IT MAKES A VARIETY OF CLARIFYING CHANGES TO INDEPENDENT STUDY INCLUDING SPECIFYING THAT OUR LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES MAY RECEIVE APPOINTMENT. EXCUSE ME RECEIVE APPORTIONMENT FOR STUDENTS PARTICIPATING IN INDEPENDENT STUDY AS A RESULT OF BEING QUARANTINED FOR COVERT NINETEEN. IT ALSO SPECIFIES THAT OUR CLASSROOM BASED CHARTER SCHOOLS DO NOT HAVE TO FILE FUNDING DETERMINATIONS FOR PROVIDING INDEPENDENT STUDY INSTRUCTION TO THOSE STUDENTS IN COVERT NINETEEN RELATED QUARANTINE. WHAT MAKES A VARIETY OF OTHER CHANGES NECESSARY TO IMPLEMENT THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET. INCLUDING THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO BUDGET SKEWS ME INCLUDING PROVIDING A PROCESS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF MODEL CURRICULA. AMENDING THE SPLIT A FEDERAL STIMULUS FUNDS AND PROP NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUNDS FOR A VARIETY OF PROGRAMS. AND PROVIDING ADDITIONAL FLEXIBILITY FOR THE USE OF SUBSTITUTE TEACHERS AMONG OTHER AMENDMENTS. AND WITH THAT I ASK FOR YOUR ADDRESS. IS THERE ANY DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM SENATOR BURGESS. THE PRESIDENT IF I MAY POSE A QUESTION TO THE AUTHOR. THE CHAIR. SENATOR SKINNER YOU ACCEPT THE QUESTION YES HE WROTE THANK YOU I RECEIVED A- SOME PHONE CALLS FROM FOLKS- IN EDUCATION AND THEY HAD SOME. FINANCED THEY HAD SOME CONCERN ABOUT THE INDEPENDENT STUDY- REQUIREMENT. I'M TRYING TO RIP RECOLLECTED EXACTLY WHAT CHANGED. IN THE EARLIER ITERATIONS BUT NOW THAT WHEN KIDS ARE OUT OF SCHOOL BECAUSE OF A CODE RELATED MATTERS THAT THEY MUST DO AN INDEPENDENT STUDY AND THAT TRIGGERS A WHOLE NEW SET OF REQUIREMENTS HAVE YOU HEARD FROM- SUPERINTENDENTS OR- THEIR REPRESENTATIVES AFFILIATES ABOUT THE CONCERNS ABOUT. HELLO THIS IS A LITTLE BIT IN THIS IS BURDENSOME AND COULD CREATE COMPLICATIONS FOR THE FOR THE DISTRICT'S. THERE WERE SOME FINANCE ARE THERE WERE SOME ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS THEY JUST FEEL THEY WERE NOT. THE VARIETY OF EXPRESSIONS WERE VARIED AND SO TO LAND ON A PARTICULAR CHANGE THAT WOULD ADDRESS TE VERY CONCERNS WAS DIFFICULT GIVEN ARE GIVEN THE TIMING WE HAD. BUT THE CHANGES WE ARE MAKING DO ACCOMMODATE FOR OUR UNANTICIPATED SURGE DUE TO THE DELTA WHERE WE ARE HAVING MORE CHILDREN HAVING TO BE QUARANTINED AND THUS IN ORDER FOR THEM TO CONTINUE TO GET INSTRUCTION. ALLOWING THEM TO DO INDEPENDENT STUDY WHICH THIS BILL DOES. SO IT DIDN'T LET ME JUST CLARIFY THIS MAY NOT BE OF. THE OPPORTUNE MOMENT THIS MAIN NEED RECORD THIS MAY NEED A LITTLE BIT MORE REVISITING. BUT IF I RECOLLECT APPROPRIATELY- DURING NORMAL COVE IN WHEN A STUDENT WAS OUT THEY WERE GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY- TO MAKE UP CLASS. IN THE NORMAL FORMAT AS OPPOSED TO HAVING TO GO THROUGH THE RIGORS OF AN INDEPENDENT STUDY. AND THAT TRIGGERED- ALL SORTS OF OVERSIGHT AND- THE DIFFICULTY THAT SOME OF THE INDEPENDENT STUDY FOLKS HAVE HABIT OF COURSE DO WITH BROADBAND SO MAYBE ADD AT A LATER POINT IF YOU COULD PUT THIS- FEATHER IN YOUR CAP TO REVISIT SUFFERED FROM SUPERINTENDENTS AND OTHER FOLKS ESPECIALLY IN RURAL FOOTHILL MOUNTAIN COMMUNITIES. THAT THIS COULD BE A POTENTIAL CHALLENGE- FOR FOLKS THAT- ARE DEALING WITH THE COVERT ISSUE- WHAT I WOULD REFERENCE IS THAT AS I THINK ALL OF US APPRECIATE IN THE ACTIONS WE TOOK IN JUNE WE WERE OUR INTENTION WAS TO HELP GET EVERY STUDENT BACK IN THE CLASSROOM IN EVERY SCHOOL TO HAVE INSPIRATION INSTRUCTION- NOW IF WE SEE THAT WE CONTINUE TO HAVE THE LEVEL OF EITHER NEW CODE NINETEEN VARIANTS AND THE LEVEL OF- OF- INFECTION RATES. THEN WE MAY HAVE TO MAKE MORE MODIFICATIONS IN JANUARY CLEARLY HOWEVER THESE ARE ON THE MAIN MODIFICATIONS THAT ARE DIFFERENT DISTRICTS INCLUDING OUR CHARTER SCHOOLS ASKED FOR AND WE ADDRESSED THOSE IN THIS BUT OF COURSE WE'LL CONTINUE TO MONITOR AND IF NEEDED WILL MAKE ADDITIONAL IN JANUARY OR- THEREAFTER.

EIGHTY ONE SENATOR MCGUIRE IS READY. MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE READ ASSEMBLY BILL FOUR EIGHTY ONE BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER TO AN ACT RELATING TO MILITARY EQUIPMENT- MY GUARD FOR TWO YEARS. THANK YOU SO MUCH BETTER PRESIDENT MEMBERS SAY AB FORTY ONE BY SIN REMEMBER Q. IS A GOOD GOVERNMENT TELL IT ESTABLISHES TRANSPARENCY BETWEEN OUR COMMUNITIES AND LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES WHO SERVE THAT WITH REGARD TO THE USE OF MILITARY EQUIPMENT. THE BILL CALLS FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THIS IS ALL ABOUT LOCAL CONTROL IT CALLS FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO WORK WITH OUR LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ENFORCEMENT PARTNERS TO ESTABLISH A TRANSPARENT MILITARY EQUIPMENT POLICY THAT ALLOWS FOR BASIC ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THE PUBLIC. IT SIMPLY ASKED STATE AGENCIES TO ESTABLISH A CLEAR MILITARY EQUIPMENT USE POLICY THAT'S REVIEWED BY THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE IN POSTED ONLINE FOR THE PUBLIC TO SEE THE BILL'S FINAL VERSION ADDRESSES KEY CONCERNS BY THE POLICE CHIEF OF THE CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL AND WAS ARRIVED AT AFTER SIGNIFICANT ENGAGEMENT BETWEEN US AND THE VIRTUE WHICH GRATEFUL FOR HIS WORK- AS WELL AS LAW ENFORCEMENT. NOTHING IN THIS BILL NOTHING IN THIS BILL RESTRICTS THE COMMUNITY OR POLICE DEPARTMENT FOR PROCURING ANY MILITARY COMMAND THEY CHOOSE TO THE BILL WOULD SIMPLY ENSURE THE PUBLIC KNOWS WINNING HOW MILITARY EQUIPMENT BEING USED ESPECIALLY WHEN PUBLIC DOLLARS ARE PAYING. FOR THAT EQUIPMENT WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AND I HAVE A- THERE ANY DISCUSSION OR DEBATE THIS ITEM. SENATOR BURGESS. A RISE IN RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL I THINK THIS IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF US MICROMANAGING LAW ENFORCEMENT. WITHOUT HAVING THE REQUISITE INSIDE UNDERSTANDING OF THE THREAT THEY ARE FIGHTING AGAINST MANY OF THESE GANGS. HAVE SOPHISTICATED WEAPONS. SO WHETHER YOU'RE IN SWAT OR IN SOME OTHER TACTICAL UNIT. BEING ABLE TO HAVE THIS INFORMATION IN A REHAB THESE RESOURCES AT YOUR DISPOSAL ARE TERRIBLY IMPORTANT SO THIS IDEA THAT. IF THEY COULD GIVE A CITY OR A COUNTY WERE TO CREATE A MILITARY EQUIPMENT PURCHASE LIST. THAT IS ONLY A SEGUE INTO JUSTIFICATION FOR WHY IT'S NEEDED AT ALL. AND I THINK WE ALL KNOW WHERE THIS IS GOING THIS IS. A CLEAR EXAMPLE OF A PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT HAS THAT'S GOING TO HAVE. CONSEQUENCES THAT. ULTIMATELY IS TRYING TO TIE THE HANDS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT IN THEIR ABILITY TO HANDLE DYNAMIC IN VERY DANGEROUS SITUATIONS. SO I WOULD I WOULD RESPECTFULLY REQUEST COLLEAGUES LOOK AT THIS FOR WHAT IT IS. THIS IS NOT GIVING LOCALS THE AUTHORITY TO DECIDE ON MILITARY EQUIPMENT LESS IMPOSING IT ON LINE. THIS IS A PRELUDE TO THEM HAVING TO JUSTIFY THE PURCHASE OF THAT EQUIPMENT HOW IT'S ARSENAL LIES IN HOW ULTIMATELY IT IS USED. I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST A NO VOTE. FOR ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM. FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. SENATOR REID JUST A QUESTION OF THE AUTHOR OF THE PRESENT. DO YOU ACCEPT IT A QUESTION CENTER MOLESTED A PRESENT THANK YOU HE WILL. I GUESS MY QUESTION IS THE OPPOSITION LISTA. UP TO DATE ON THIS PARTICULAR FLORIDA OFFICES. THANK YOU SO MUCH AT SENATOR AS FAR AS IT BEING UP TO DATE I DON'T KNOW IF IT REFLECTS THE DAY OF SEPTEMBER NINTH WHICH IS TODAY SO I APOLOGIZE AND I DON'T KNOW HOW UP TO DATE D. SUPPORTER IN OPPOSITION LISTED. AND IF I MAY ASK ONE MORE QUESTION THIS THROUGH THE EMAIL PRESIDENT. MMHM YOU KNOW I HAVEN'T VOTED FOR THESE BILLS IN THE PAST AT LEAST THE ONES THAT I RECALL. BUT AS I READ THIS ONE AND I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE I'M CLEAR- MISSED FOR MANAGER. PRESIDENT THERE'S A LIST OF IN THE BILL ITSELF IS A LIST OF. ALL SORTS MOTOR EQUIPMENT FROM. FIFTY CALIBER AMMUNITION TO WATER CANNONS TO A WHOLE VARIETY OF THINGS- SOME OF WHICH I HAVE DIFFICULTY UNDERSTANDING. HOW THOSE COULD BE UTILIZED IN AN URBAN SETTING BUT OTHER PIECES OF EQUIPMENT I COULD SEE IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES YOU MIGHT WANT TO. DEPLOY ALL THE ALL OF THAT EQUIPMENT. IT CAN BE PURCHASED. BY LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY PROVIDED THAT THE LOCAL BOARD WHETHER IT'S A CITY COUNCIL OR BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. AUTHORIZES THAT ACQUISITION IN A POLICY AND PRESUMABLY AT THE TIME OF PURCHASE BECAUSE OF COURSE THE BUDGETS HAVE TO BE APPROVED BY THOSE OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT BODIES IS THAT CORRECT SENATOR YOU'RE CORRECTED BILL DOES NOT. ADVANCE AN OUTRIGHT BAN IN FACTTHE PREVIOUS BILL WHEN GOVERNOR BROWN WHY IS IN OFFICE WAS VETOED BECAUSE HE BELIEVED THAT THIS ORIGINAL BILL THE ORIGINAL BILL OF WHAT WE HAVE IN FRONT OF US TODAY QUOTE WAS OVERLY BROAD- I WANT TO MAKE SURE FOLKS KNOW ON THE RECORD- THAT. LAW ENFORCEMENT CAN CONTINUE TO PURCHASE BUT THEY DO HAVE TO LISTED- IN A PUBLIC FORUM SO THE NAME IS THAT WE'RE TAKING CLARIFY. THAT ITS GENERAL USE IN QUITMAN STANDARD ISSUE ITEMS RIDGE ARRANGING FO PEPPER SPRAYED SHOT GUNS- IN THIS MEANS LAW ENFORCEMENT CAN CONTINUE ACQUIRING DAILY USE ITEMS- IS WELL SO AGAIN IT SIMPLY CREATES THIS DATABASE BUT IT DOES NOT BAN- THE PURCHASE OF EQUIPMENT. WELL THANK YOU SIR I THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. IN MADAM PRESIDENT IF IT'S ALRIGHT I JUST RECEIVED INFORMATION TO- THE GOOD SENATOR FROM IN AN EMPIRE THE ONLY GROUP AS OF TODAY MY UNDERSTANDING FROM THE AUTHOR'S OFFICE IS THE AGAIN ALWAYS WANT TO BE TRANSPARENT TO THE CHAMBER THAT REMAINS THE STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION THAT THEY REMAIN IN OPPOSITION- CURRENTLY SO I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WAS A QUESTION THAT WAS ASKED I COULDN'T ANSWER I DO HAVE THE ANSWER INTO TO SENATOR ROSS I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT IT WAS ABLE TO ANSWER THAT. SENATOR MELINDA IS I THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT- SENATORS I THINK THE PREVIOUS SPEAKERS BROUGHT UP SOME VERY GOOD POINTS TONIGHT IT'S- NOT NECESSARILY IN THE BEST INTEREST OF PUBLIC SAFETY TO HAVE OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES HAVE TO SAY MOTHER MAY I BEFORE THEY PURCHASE QUICK MINUTE EQUIPMENT THAT THEY NEED TO KEEP THE COMMUNITY SAFE AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE LIST OF ITEMS YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT YEAH THERE'S CERTAINLY SOME BIG TICKET ITEMS IN THERE AND SOME BIGGER PIECES OF EQUIPMENT. BUT THERE'S ALSO SIMPLE THINGS LIKE BEAN BAGS AND EQUIPMENT TO YOU KNOW BE ABLE TO BREAK DOWN THE DOOR TO GET IN THERE AND GET SOMEONE WHO'S IN DANGER- I JUST. IS THAT WHERE WE WANT TO GO WHERE WE WANT TO HAVE OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT QUESTION BY CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS. WHO VERY LIKELY ARE NOT LAW ENFORCEMENT- FORMER LAW ENFORCEMENT MEMBERS THEMSELVES ARE THEY THE BEST PEOPLE TO DECIDE. WHETHER OR NOT THE- AGENCIES NEED THOSE THINGS TO BE ABLE TO KEEP THE COMMUNITY SAFE I THINK THIS GOES. A LITTLE FAR AND I WOULD URGE YOU KNOW BUT THANK YOU. IS THERE ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM. FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE CENTER MY WORRY MAKING FOOD THANK YOU SO MUCH LOOK. I UNDERSTAND IT IS CONTAGIOUS CONCERNS AND REALLY GRATEFUL I TWO THREE SENATORS ADVANCED QUESTIONS AND CONCERNS. NUMBER TWO HAS BEEN WORKING TO BE ABLE TO NARROW THIS DOWN. AND TO BE ABLE TO FOCUS ON SOME OF THE BIGGER CHALLENGES. SO AGAIN THIS MEANS LAW ENFORCEMENT WITH THIS BILL LADIES AND GENTLEMAN COULD CONTINUE ACQUIRING DAILY USE ITEMS SUCH AS PEPPER SPRAY STANDARD ISSUE FIREARMS- IS WELL WITHOUT ANY NEW REPORTING UNDER THIS BILL BUT LOOK WE ALL TALK ABOUT LOCAL CONTROL WE ALL TALK ABOUT TRANSPARENCY. THIS BILL ADVANCES LOCAL CONTROL. AND IT'S ULTIMATELY UP TO THE ELECTED OFFICIALS BOARDS OF SUPERVISORS CITY COUNCILS APPEAR TO MAKE THIS DECISION. NUMBER TWO IT'S ALSO ABOUT TRANSPARENCY IN THE PUBLIC DOES DESERVE TO BE ABLE TO SEE- WHAT LAW ENFORCEMENT MILITARY EQUIPMENT IS POTENTIALLY BEING PURCHASED OUT OF LOCAL CONTROL IN RESPECT FOR TRANSPARENCY WOULD RESPECTFULLY RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL.

THE PEOPLE THAT WERE IN PRISON AND FELONS AND TRYING TO HELP PEOPLE IN OUR LIVES NEVER HAD- LIKE. SEVERELY DISABLED BUT- YOU KNOW THE GOAL IS TO. HAVE THE ABILITY BELLA. HELP THEM GET A JOB AND THE SKILL SETS ALWAYS AREN'T AT THE LEVEL OF THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO THE JOBBUT- OTHER QUICK A QUICK ACTION OF A QUESTION OF THE AUTHOR IF I MAY. QUESTION FOR THE AUTHOR. ARE YOU WILLING TO TAKE IT CENTER. I'M I'M SO VERY SORRY MENTIONED CANNOT HEAR THE QUESTION AGAIN WELL I HAVEN'T HE HASN'T ASKED IT I'M JUST ASKING IF IT'S OKAY IF YOU ASK YOU A QUESTION ALL. SURE HE WILL TAKE THE QUESTION SO THE GOAL IS TO ACTUALLY EMPLOY THEM AND DO YOU BELIEVE THAT IF WE RAISE THE RATE TO THE MINIMUM WAGE THAT WILL THEY'LL ACTUALLY NOT BE HIRED THAT'S WHAT I'M WORRIED ABOUT IS THAT AN EMPLOYER WOULD GO WITH THE SKILLS THAT WILL MAYBE NOT BE THERE BUT I WOULD BE WILLING TO YOU KNOW TAKE TAKE THE CHANCE AND MAYBE. HELP THEM BE EMPLOYED. BECAUSE IT'S A LOWER RATE AND IT'S GONNA TAKE MORE WORK OR DO YOU BELIEVE THAT WE'RE GOING TO ACTUALLY. KEEP THEM EMPLOYED I I'M THAT'S TORRES WAS TEARING ME ABOUT THIS. THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION SURE. FRENCH PRESIDENT YOU MAY PROCEED THANK YOU- YES- WE ARE GOING IN THAT DIRECTION ANYWAY AS A COUNTRY- THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY TEN OTHER STATES THAT HAVE ALREADY GONE IN THIS DIRECTION EVERYWHERE FROM NEW YORK TO CONNECTICUT TO TEXAS. R. ALASKA THEY'VE ALREADY MADE THIS DECISION IN THEIR STATE- SO I FEEL VERY COMFORTABLE THAT IF IT HAD- BECAUSE- OUR BROTHERS AND SISTERS IN THE DISABILITY COMMUNITY TO LOSE. OUT ON THAT DECISION. THAT IT WOULDN'T HAVE GONE AS FAR AS THE DATE AS FAR AS STATE TO STATE TO STATE- WE ALSO TOOK THE A MODEL OF MARYLAND- TO COME UP WITH. THESE KIND OF AMENDMENTS FOR EXAMPLE TO HAVE SELF ADVOCATES THOSE WHO ACTUALLY WORKED FOR SOME MINIMUM WAGE OUGHT TO BE ON THE ADVISORY SO WE COULD IT'S NOT ME TELLING THEM. BUT IT'S ACTUALLY THEY THEMSELVES PARTICIPATING- WE ALSO CHANGED IT TO SAY THAT A PHASE OUT PLAN WOULD BE DEVELOPED WITH ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS AND THEIR INVOLVEMENT SO WE'RE NOT LOOKING TO DO THIS FROM ONE DAY TO ANOTHER. IT WILL BE THREE YEARS WE WILL HAVE A PHASE OUT PLAN WE ARE NOT LOOKING OUT TO HURT ANYBODY'S CHANCES OF WORKING. BUT WE DO FEEL VERY STRONGLY THAT. WHEN THEY WORK THEY OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO COUNT ON THE MINIMUM WAGE IN THIS STATE AND I KNOW NATIONALLY- THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS ALSO LOOKING IN THAT DIRECTION THAT'S BEEN THE CONVERSATION FOR A FEW YEARS SO- THE NUMBER OF EMPLOYERS WHO ARE USING THESE WAIVERS. HAS DECREASED EVERY YEAR HERE IN CALIFORNIA- AND THE NUMBER OF THOSE WHO ARE WORKING UNDER SOME MINIMUM WAGE HAS ALSO DECREASED SO I BELIEVE WE ARE GOING IN THAT DIRECTION LET'S PLANET LET'S DO IT THE RIGHT WAY. WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS INVOLVED IF I IF I MAY JUST ASK ONE MORE FOLLOW UP WAS THERE ANY. STATISTICS. SHOWN IN THOSE OTHER STATES WHERE. THE EMPLOYER'S ACTUALLY DID NOT CONTINUE TO EMPLOY THEM BECAUSE THE WAGE WENT HIGHER MAYBE THAT'S A SIMPLE WAY OF ASKING THE QUESTION. I'M SORRY I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT SENATOR. THANK YOU FOR YOUR FOR I REALLY WANT TO. I THINK THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY REALLY I'M LOOKING AT IS- AND I'M JUST CONCERNED THAT. IF THE SKILL LEVEL IS NOT THERE TO MATCH THE ABILITY FOR THE WAGE THAT IT MAY BE ACTUALLY WORK IN REVERSE WHERE THEY WOULD NOT HAVE THE UPDATE WOULD BE HIRED. SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR INPUT- SO I HAVE. SENATOR HER DAUGHTER THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL IT'S A BILL THAT- WE HEARD AND HUMAN SERVICES COMMITTEE AND I KNOW IT'S A VERY. IT'S A IT'S A DIFFICULT ONE RIGHT I MEAN WE DON'T WANT TO ELIMINATE A JOB OPPORTUNITY- FOR OUR MOST VULNERABLE POPULATION BUT I. THE PRACTICE AS THE AUTHOR MENTIONED- WE ARE MOVING TOWARDS THAT PATH TO THE MATTER FIVE YEARS AND- IT AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL AND THERE'S ALREADY STATES THAT ARE WORKING TOWARDS- TRYING TO IMPLEMENT THAT AS THE AUTHOR MENTIONED. AND I THINK THAT THIS BILL WAS IMPROVED AND TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE WAS AN ADEQUATE TRANSITION PLAN IN THERE SO THAT. THEY'RE NOT LEFT BEHIND THAT THEY'RE NOT LEFT WITHOUT- OR AT RISK OF LOSING THE DOES A JOB OPPORTUNITIES AND THERE'S ALSO MONEY. I BELIEVE IN THE BUDGET- TO HELP WITH ADDITIONAL EMPLOYMENT ACTIVITY SO JUST WANTED TO- EXPRESSED MY SUPPORT FOR THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION AND FOR THE AUTHOR AND- AND FOR ALL HER WORK AND AT. DOING EVERYTHING SHE CAN TO MAKE SURE THAT IT BECOMES EVEN BETTER AND MORE PROTECTIONS. AND FOR THOSE REASONS I ASKED FOR AND I PUT. SENATOR WITH A THANK YOU AND I APPLAUD THIS BILL THE AUTHOR FOR TAKING IT UP BY I RAN WITH THIS BILL AND SUCCESSFULLY APPROXIMATELY SEVEN YEARS AGO AND I LAMENT THE DAY DIDN'T PASS BECAUSE I'VE HAD EXPERIENCE WORKING- WITH THESE INDIVIDUALS HAVE HAD. EXPERIENCE IN TERMS OF HOW THEY PERFORM THEIR JOBS WORKING WITH THEM I'M CONVINCED THAT OUR LADIES AND GENTLEMEN THAT ON THIS EARTH. THERE IS A PLACE FOR EVERY SINGLE PERSON. IN OUR SOCIETY AND OUR ECONOMY THERE IS A PLACE. AND WE SHOULD NOT PUNISH THEM FOR BEING PART OF A GROUP. THAT IS IDENTIFIED WITH HER HAVING CERTAIN ABILITIES AND NOT OTHERS WE DON'T DO THAT TO ANY OTHER HUMAN BEINGS AND IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE THAT WE WOULD SINGLE THEM OUT. AND THIS IS A FORM OF DISCRIMINATION IN OUR SOCIETY THAT WE NEED TO END. THERE IS A PLACE FOR EVERYBODY LET'S WORK VERY HARD. AS A LEGISLATURE MAKE PLACE IN CALIFORNIA FOR EVERYBODY DESPITE THEIR SKILL SET. ANYBODY COULD BE TRAINED TO DO ALMOST ANYTHING AND SOMEBODY COULD HAVE SOMETHING VERY SPECIAL TO CONTRIBUTE IN THIS ECONOMY AND WE COULD FIND THAT. I HAVE WORKED WITH SO MANY. NEVER MISS A DAY SOME ARE NEVER LATE. SUMMER VERY PRODUCTIVE AND TAKE MORE PRIDE IN DOING THEIR JOB. THEN AGAIN ANOTHER PERSON THAT MAY BE IDENTIFIED AS HAVING. YOUR ABILITIES AND THAT'S THAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE. WE NEE TO VALUE PEOPLE FOR THE FOR THE SKILLS THAT THEY DO POSSESS THEM AND ALLOW THEM TO DEVELOP THOSE SKILLS A LITTLE BIT MORE WORK SUCCESSFULLY IN OUR ECONOMY THIS IS OVERDUE. I HOPE WE STAND TOGETHER UP IN A BI BI PARTISAN EFFORT TO BRING AN END TO THIS PRACTICE AND START INVEST. IN THE PEOPLE OF OUR STATE. SENATOR KAMMERER. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I RISE AS A STRONG SUPPORTER OF THIS BILL AND HAS A PROUD CO AUTHOR. I WAS I'M EXCITED TO HEAR IT WHEN IT CAME BEFORE US IN HUMAN SERVICES. AND I DON'T RECALL IF I SHARED THIS IN THE COMMITTEE BUT. MY STEP SON WAS DIAGNOSED WITH AUTISM. AND I AS A RESULT HAVE SPENT A LOT OF TIME AT REGIONAL CENTERS GETTING TO KNOW OTHER PARENTS. ADULT CHILDREN AND YOUNG CHILDREN. WHO ARE ON THE SPECTRUM. AND LEARNING ABOUT WHAT IT MEANS. TO LOVE SOMEONE AND TO WANT TO SEE THEM SUCCEED. WHO WAS ON THE SPECTRUM. AND ONE EVENING AT THE WESTSIDE REGIONAL CENTER I ENDED UP HAVING A DISCUSSION WITH THIS FATHER OF AN ADULT CHILD. WHO'S ON THE SPECTRUM. AND HE TALKED ABOUT HIS SON WANTING TO WORK. AND HAVING A REALLY HARD TIME FINDING WORK. BECAUSE OF HIS AUTISM. AND THE GLORIOUS MESS THAT CAME WHEN HE WAS ABLE TO SECURE HIM A JOB. AT A THEME PARK. AND HE TALKED ABOUT THE VALUE THAT COMES FROM WORK. THE VALUE THAT COMES FROM BEING THE VALUE. FROM BEING ABLE TO DO SOMETHING. CREATE SOME THINGS ARE SERVICE SOMEONE. THAT'S WHAT EVERY PARENT IS HOPING THEIR CHILD WILL FIND. REGARDLESS OF IF THEY ARE ON THE SPECTRUM OR NOT. I RECALL ANOTHER DISCUSSION THAT I HAD WITH AN ADVOCATE NAME HERALD AND HERALD SAID. I'M ON THE SPECTRUM AND I CAN TELL YOU WHAT THAT'S LIKE. THAT'S LIKE BEING IN A HAM RADIO IN AN FM DIGITAL WORLD. IT DOESN'T MEAN YOU CAN'T DO SOMETHING IT DOESN'T MEAN YOU'RE NOT WORTH THE SAME AS SOMEONE ELSE IT JUST MEANS YOUR DIFFERENT. THIS BILL. IT'S ABOUT. THE ONLY. OUR FAMILY MEMBERS AND OUR BROTHERS AND SISTERS. WHO ARE ON THE SPECTRUM. WE FIGHT SO HARD. INTEGRATE. OUR FAMILY MEMBERS. INTO SPACES WHERE THEY CAN LIVE AND LEARN AND LOVE AND WAR. AND CONTRIBUTE IN WAYS THAT MAKE THIS STATE AND OUR COMMUNITIES AND THIS COUNTRY GREAT. AND IT IS ABOUT TIME THAT WE SEE. M. FOR ALL THAT THEY ARE WORTH. I CAN'T TELL YOU. I CAN TELL YOU. THE BRILLIANCE THAT COMES. FROM BEING TOUCHED BY SOMEONE WHO IS ON THE SPECTRUM. AND SO I WOULD ASK THAT YOU WOULD TAKE THAT INTO CONSIDERATION WITH THOSE FOLKS EVEN THOUGH I KNOW IT'S ON CONCURRENCE. IN THE ALL RIGHT. BECAUSE WE SHOULD BE VALUING OUR WORKERS. AND WE SHOULD NOT BE PLACING A LESSER VALUE ON THEM. BECAUSE THEY HAVE A DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY OR BECAUSE THEY ARE ON THE SPECTRUM. AND SO WITH THAT I ASK FOR YOUR VOTE FOR SB SIX THREE NINE. SENATOR BAKER. THANK YOU AND I THINK BY CALLING FROM LOS ANGELES FOR THOSE MOVING WORDS AND I JUST WAS COMPELLED TO RISE AS WELL I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL MY BROTHER IN LAW HAS WORKED IN A SEVEN WAY TIE CAPACITY IN OREGON FOR MANY YEARS AND THEY'VE ALSO MOVED IN THIS DIRECTION AND MY- MOTHER IN LAW SAYS IT'S BEEN BASICALLY GOOD BUT BUT ALSO THERE'S BEEN SOME NEGATIVE INFOGRAPHIC CATIONS AS WELL SO I JUST- HI I APPRECIATE THE OFFER FOR THE WORK AND THEN. AND I JUST HOPE THAT AS WE DEVELOP THIS THIS PLAN- WE REALLY DO- TAKING ACCOUNT- ALL THOSE CHALLENGES AND- AND LOOK AT SOME OF THE SITUATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN WORKING AND- YOU KNOW AS WE GO PLAN GOING FORWARD SO AGAIN I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL AND JUST WHEN IT RAISES CONCERNS FROM FROM WHAT I'VE SEEN IN THE ORGAN SITUATION I KNOW THAT WE HAVE. TO BE VERY CAREFUL IN THIS AREA THANK YOU. SENATOR BATES. YES THANK YOU- MAN PRESIDENTIAL IN MY EARLY YEARS AS A SOCIAL WORKER MY SPECIFIC ASSIGNMENT WAS WITH IN THE PROGRAM CALLED AID TO THE DISABLED SO WE HAD MANY MANY PEOPLE WHO DID HAVE THE CHALLENGES ON ACROSS THE SPECTRUM CERTAINLY PHYSICAL MENTAL HANDED THE PHONE MINIMUM WAGE WAS REALLY A WAY TO INCENTIVIZE EMPLOYERS TO ACTUALLY EMPLOY THESE INDIVIDUALS AND I BELIEVE THE IDEA STARTED WITH PEOPLE WHO WERE. WORKING IN THE AREA WITHOUT PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES- MY MOTHER IN LAW WAS A SPECIAL ED TEACHER VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE CHILDREN IN HER CLASSES THAT WOULD LEAVE THAT AND HAVE NOWHERE TO GO SO I THINK WE HAVE TO BALANCE HERE OF THE INCENTIVE VISITATION FOR EMPLOYERS AND THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THOSEEMPLOYERS TO HAVE KIND OF A GRADUAL- WAY TO HIRE SOMEONE ON SET MINIMUM WAGE TREATMENT AND MOVE THEM UP TO MINIMUM THE NINETY EVEN BEYOND BECAUSE SO MANY OF THE INDIVIDUALS DESIGNATED AS PHYSICALLY OR MENTALLY CHALLENGED. WHEN THEY'RE GIVEN. THAT AN INDIVIDUAL TREE RAINING THE- ARE THRIVE IN THEY DO GROW BUT I WOULD BE CONCERNED THAT WE TAKE AWAY THE INCENTIVE. SO THAT THOSE EMPLOYERS WHO HAVEN'T BEEN INVOLVED IN ALL THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE WITH UNDERSTAND THAT GIVEN THE CHANCE. ANSEL THE BALANCE IS A CONCERN TO ME. THE DATE THAT THIS WILL BE IMPLEMENTED TWENTY TWENTY FIVE DOESN'T GIVE US SOME TIME TO GET SOME EVIDENCE IT MAY BE A WAY TO EDUCATE OUR EMPLOYERS BUT I THINK FOR TODAY I'M JUST GOING TO LAY OFF. THE ON THOSE AND MAYBE WORK WITH YOUI THINK IT'S A VERY NOBLE EFFORT THAT YOU HAVE UNDERTAKEN BUT I DO THINK WE NEED A LITTLE MORE EVIDENCE TO MAKE SURE THAT. WE ARE GOING TO SET OURSELVES BACK INSTEAD OF MOVING OURSELVES FORWARD. THANK YOU. SENATOR CORTESE. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT RISE UP IN SUPPORT OF SB SIX THIRTY NINE- IT WAS CERTAINLY A BUILD UPON- THE COMMENTS MADE BY MY COLLEAGUE FROM SANGER AND CALLING FROM LOS ANGELES- FROM THE OFFERING FROM OTHERS WHO HAVE ALREADY SPOKEN IN FAVOR OF THE BILL TODAY I JUST WANT TO SIMPLY SAY THIS. IN COMING TO THE STATE SENATE- I KNEW THAT. WE WOULD BE VOTING ON A LOT OF BILLS AND I SUSPECTED THAT I WOULD BE PROUD OF A LOT OF MY UNABLE TO HOPEFULLY ALL OF THEM AND I CAN SAY AS OF TODAY- THAT THAT'S TRUE. BUT I DON'T THINK I'LL BE PROUD. I'M MORE PROUD OF AND I BUILT IN THE ONE I CAST I HAVE CAST IN THE WINNER WILL CAST AGAIN TODAY IN CONCURRENCE ON THIS BILL BECAUSE THIS IS A MAJOR CIVIL RIGHTS BILL A BOLD STEP ON BEHALF OF THE DISABILITY COMMUNITY. AND IT IS. DESPITE THE NUMBER OF BILLS THAT THEY'RE IN THE VOLUME OF BILLS THAT WE DEAL WITH IT IT'S STILL RARE TO GET THE OPPORTUNITY TO CHANGE THE COURSE OF HISTORY WHEN IT COMES TO CIVIL RIGHTS WE'VE HAD THE OPTION TO DO IT MORE THAN ONCE IN THIS CHAMBERS RECENTLY- THANKS TO. OTHER COLLEAGUES AND- I JUST WANTED TO SAY TODAY LET'S NOT. LET'S NOT. BE SO BURIED IN THE NUMBER OF BILLS THAT THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH IN THE DETAIL. OF THE BILLS THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH A TO NOT CELEBRATE RECOGNIZE MOMENT. OF THAT WE ACTUALLY HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO CALIFORNIA TO RECTIFY A WRONG THAT IS ALMOST ONE HUNDRED YEARS OLD. THANK YOU. ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. SENATOR- TROUBLE THIS IS ON CONCURRENT. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I WAS NOT PLANNING ON SPEAKING BUT- I FEEL COMPELLED TO SHARE. THE WORDS OF AND CONSTITUENT OF MINE ACTUALLY TO- BOTH MOTHER AND DAUGHTER THE DAUGHTER- IS A SPECIAL NEEDS CHILD AND LEAD TEACHER THIS IS FOR YOU. WHO MET WITH ME ON A- Z. MEETING. AT TWICE ADVOCATING. FOR HERSELF TO BE ABLE TO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO WORK. AND SHE PLEADED YOU KNOW SHE PLEADED HER CASE AND DID A BEAUTIFUL JOB ADVOCATING FOR HERSELF AND THOSE IN THE SPECIAL NEEDS COMMUNITY. AND HER WORDS WERE HEY GUYS PLEASE. PLEASE MAKE SURE THAT I HAVE A JOB. PLEASE MAKE SURE THAT- HE PROTECT MY OPPORTUNITY TO WORK. YOU SEE THE THING IS THAT WE HAVE PEOPLE ON THE DISABILITY- SPECTRUM TWITTERVERSE SOME CAN BE EMPLOYED- ON MINIMUM WAGE BECAUSE THEY'RE THAT FUNCTIONAL. HOWEVER WE DO HAVE OTHERS WERE ALSO ON THE DISABILITY SPECTRUM WHERE THEY CANNOT AND WOULD NOT HAVE OTHERWISE BE ABLE TO BE EMPLOYED BECAUSE OF THEIR DISABILITIES. AND IT IS FOR THOSE. THAT DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO IN A REGULAR IN. THAT WE NEED TO PUT AND HAVE THIS- THESE PARTS. FOR THE MOTHER WAS VERY INTERESTING BECAUSE WHEN I MET WITH HER I ALSO WAS INTERESTED IN MAKING SURE THAT HER MOM WAS THERE TO ALSO- ADVOCATE FOR HER DAUGHTER AND CONFIRM WHAT HER DAUGHTER WAS STATING. AND HER MOTHER AND THIS WERE HER WORDS HER MOTHER STATED THAT MY DAUGHTER CAN'T COMPETE WITH SOMEONE WHO IS AN ENTRY LEVEL WAGE WORKER. BECAUSE SHE DOESN'T HAVE THAT CAPACITY. BY BRINGING OUR SPECIAL NEEDS COMMUNITY TO THE MINIMUM WAGE. REQUIREMENT SHE HAS TO COMPETE WITH OTHER PEOPLE WHO ARE ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS- SPEAKERS AND SHE HAS TO COMPETE WITH ENTRY LEVEL WAGE WORKERS WHO ARE FULLY CAPACITY TO WORK FULLY EDIT PRODUCE MORE THAN MY DAUGHTER IS ABLE TO DO HOW DOES MY DAUGHTER COMPETE. WITH THOSE ABILITIES BECAUSE SHE CAN'T. WHICH IS WHY SHE NEEDS TO BE PROTECTED. IF MY DAUGHTER HAD THE ABILITY TO COMPETE AND HAD THE ABILITY TO PRODUCE. THE EQUAL AMOUNT OF WORK AND THE QUALITY OF WORK OF OTHER INDIVIDUALS. THEY'RE FULL TO CAPACITY ADDED IN THERE WOULD BE NO NEED. FOR THOSE PROTECTIONS. BUT SHE DOESN'T IT IS BECAUSE OF THAT THAT WE CONTINUE TO ADVOCATE TO PROTECT HER ABILITY TO WORK. SO IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE IF I HEAR THE WORDS FROM MY COLLEAGUES. YOU KNOW I THINK ABOUT THE TEACHER. AND I SAY HER NAME BECAUSE I WANT TO VALIDATE HER. BECAUSE SHE IS A FERVENT BITER FOR HER ABILITY AND OPPORTUNITY TO WORK. AND SHE HERSELF ACKNOWLEDGES THAT SHE CAN'T COMPETE WITH FULL CAPACITY TO PEOPLE. I HAVE AN ORGANIZATION IN MY IN MY DISTRICT BUT I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO TOUR. HAVE THE ABILITY TO INTERVIEW PEOPLE WHO WERE WORKING THERE PEOPLE DISABILITIES A DIFFERENT RANGES. AND I ASKED HIM. HOW DO YOU LIKE WORKING HERE. AND EACH OF THEM SAID THEY LOVED IT. THERE WERE THERE WAS A GENTLEMAN THERE WHO HAD WORKED SIX YEARS EIGHT YEARS AND I SAID WOW YOU'RE A LOYAL WORKER AND HE TURNED TO EVERYBODY AND HE SAID. I AM A LOYAL WORKERS. I WANT IT TO WORK. PLEASE THINK ABOUT THAT THIS IS A WELL INTENTIONED BILL. BUT HAS UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES FOR THOSE THAT CANNOT FULLY COMPETE BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE THE CAPACITY. PHYSICAL MENTAL BUT THE DESIRE TO WORK. SO ON BEHALF OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO WANT TO WORK BUT CANNOT COMPETE IN PRODUCTIVITY. EITHER PHYSICALLY OR MENTALLY BUT DECIDED THE DIGNITY FIFTY ALL THAT SELF WORTH. AND I HAD THAT OPPORTUNITY TO WORK ON THEIR BEHALF THOSE INDIVIDUALS THAT I MET IN MY DISTRICT. WE HAVE THE HEART AND DESIRE TO WORK I PLEAD WITH YOU LET'S NOT VOTE ON THE BILL THAT JUST MAKES IT REAL MORE MORMON BUZZY OURSELF BUT THINK ABOUT THEM WHO ARE ADVOCATING FOR THEMSELVES. A TEACHER THIS IS FOR YOU MY FRIEND AND BECAUSE OF HER I ASKED RESPECTIVELY A NEW VOTE ON THIS BILL. HE FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM. SINGMAN SENATOR ALSO YOU MAY CONCLUDE THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT AND THANK YOU TO ALL OF MY COLLEAGUES FOR YOUR HARD FELT OUR CONCERNS- I TAKE EVERYTHING THAT YOU SAID VERY SERIOUSLY- AND IT'S- THOSE THE VERY SIMILAR SENTIMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN EXPRESSED TO ME. BOTH ONE ON ONE AS WELL AS IN OUR COMMITTEES I JUST WANT TO SAY FIRST THAT THAT IS ALL OF YOU ARE EXPRESSING THE SAME CONCERNS THAT I HAVE AND THAT OTHERS HAVE THAT PUT THIS TOGETHER THAT PUT THIS BILL TOGETHER. OF THE DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA STATE COUNCIL ON DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES THESE ARE ALL ORGANIZATIONS AND OTHERS WHO AGREE WITH YOU AND ARE WORKING HARD EVERY SINGLE DAY SO THAT ANYBODY IN THE IT D. COMMUNITY WILL FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE THE FULLEST OPPORTUNITIES IN THEIR LIVES JUST LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE. EVEN THOUGH THEY HAVE DIFFERENT TALENTS AND DIFFERENT SKILLS JUST LIKE EVERYBODY IN THIS ROOM. EVERYBODY IN THIS ROOM. HAS A DIFFERENT SKILL SET. OF HAS A DIFFERENT LIFE EXPERIENCE HAVE A DIFFERENT- UP SOMEONE TO COLLEGE SOME DIDN'T. BUT WE ALL WANT TO BE TREATED THE SAME BECAUSE WE KNOW WE COULD LEARN TO DO THIS WORK AND IT'S THE SAME THING FOR OR SISTERS AND OUR BROTHERS WHETHER THEY'RE YOUNGER OR OLDER. IN THE IDT COMMUNITY OF THIS STATE IS INVESTING ENORMOUS AMOUNTS OF MONEY WE DOUBLE THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT WE'RE INVESTING IN THIS BOOK TO HELP EMPLOYERS TRANSITION. AND FOR THE SERVICES THAT ARE NEEDED SO THAT EVERY SINGLE PERSON HAS THAT HAS THE CONFIDENCE THAT THEY'VE BEEN GIVEN EVERY OPPORTUNITY. AND FINALLY I JUST WANT TO SAY THIS HAS BEEN PART OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT IN THIS COUNTRY. I MEAN THINK ABOUT WHERE- ARE DISABLED- COMMUNITY IS TODAY COMPARED TO FIFTY YEARS AGO. THEY WERE TREATED LIKE. THEY WERE COMPLETELY- DISPOSABLE YOU KNOW THEY WERE NOT GIVEN ANY OPPORTUNITIES THEY WERE NOT GIVEN BECAUSE THEY WERE SO DIFFERENT. AND THEY ARE HUMAN BEINGS WHO CAN COMPETE THEY CAN LEARN THEY DO LEARN. AND THEY OUGHT TO BE GIVEN THE FULLEST OPPORTUNITY IN THEIR LIVES TO FEEL THAT YES THEIR WORK HAS DIGNITY AND HAS THE SAME DIGNITY AS EVERY OTHER PERSON THAT WORKS IN THAT WORKPLACE.
