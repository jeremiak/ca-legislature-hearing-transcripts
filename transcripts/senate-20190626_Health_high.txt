ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. OKAY COMMON TABLE PLEASE. MR MEMBERS PAT RAN WITH THEIR ARENA SOCIO TROUBLING THE CALIFORNIA CLICK TRAINERS ASSOCIATION. FOR SOME IS THAT WE'RE NOT OPPOSED TO THE BILL WE HAVE A SUPPORT IF AMENDED WE THINK IT'S A GOOD BILL -- WE SUPPORT ALL BILLS THAT PROMOTE -- THE SAFETY OF ALL ATHLETES WHETHER THEY'RE YOUTH THEIR PROFESSIONAL OR OR OR COLLEGIATE. IN FACT THAT'S WHAT WE DO THE CALIFORNIA PLAY TRAINERS ASSOCIATION ASSOCIATION REPRESENTS THREE THOUSAND ATHLETIC TRAINERS -- IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WHO ARE TRAINED TO SPECIFICALLY DEAL WITH -- THIS -- POPULATION OF OF INDIVIDUALS -- THEY WORK AT THE PROFESSIONAL LEVEL THEY WORK AND THEY WORK FOR EVERY PROFESSIONAL TEAM IN THE STATE THEY WORK AT EVERY COLLEGE -- IN THE STATE EVERY JUNIOR COLLEGE THEY WORK IN SOME HIGH SCHOOLS A WORKING CLINICS THEY WORK FOR THE NAVY SEALS -- DISNEY. TESLA FRITO LAY -- IN ALL TYPES OF SETTINGS -- THIS IS -- THEIR TRADITIONAL SETTING OF COURSE IS ON THE ATHLETIC FIELD THE WAY THE BILL AS DRAFTED [inaudible] PRECLUDES CERTIFIED ATHLETIC TRAINERS. FROM WORKING YOU SPORTS. GAMES SPECIFICALLY -- SPECIFICALLY SECTION -- ONE TWO FOUR TWO FOUR ONE EIGHT STATES A MINIMUM OF ONE OF ONE STATE LICENSED EMERGENCY MEDICAL TECHNICIAN PARAMEDIC OR HIGHER LEVEL LICENSE MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL. SHALL BE PRESENT DURING ALL PRESEASON REGULAR SEASON. AND POSTSEASON GAMES. THE PROBLEM WITH US IS IT'S LICENSED. AT CERTIFIED ATHLETIC TRAINERS ARE LICENSED BY THE STATE UNFORTUNATELY THEY SHOULD BE BUT THEY'RE NOT -- THIS LANGUAGE PRECLUDES THEM. FROM WORKING -- BUT YOU SUPPORT GAME. WE FIND THAT. IRONIC CONSIDERING THE FACT THAT THEY CAN WORK FOR EVERY. PROFESSIONAL TEAM IN THE STATE EVERY COLLEGE IN THE STATE. AND HIGH SCHOOLS -- SO OUR WE'RE SEEKING IS THAT THEY BE ALLOWED TO WORK THESE AS WELL. BY EITHER AND YOU KNOW BY AMENDING THEM IN INTO THE BILL -- THAT IS OUR CONCERN WE THINK IT'S A GREAT BILL WE HOPE IT MOVES FORWARD THERE'S NO WAY YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT HERE TO ASK YOU TO HOLD THE BILL IN AMENDED OR ANYTHING WE THINK IT'S A REALLY GOOD BILL -- IT PROMOTES YOU SAFETY AND IN SPORTS BUT WE CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO CUT OUR MEMBERS OUT FROM WORKING IN A FIELD. IN WHICH THEY'RE TRAINED. THANK YOU I THANK YOU. SEEING NO OTHER WITNESSES AND OPPOSITION -- QUESTION COMMITTEE MEMBERS CENTER STONE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND SOME WOMEN COOPER THANK YOU FOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD I I PLAYED FOOTBALL AS A YOUNG BOY. POP WARNER FOOTBALL I PLAYED JUNIOR HIGH FOOTBALL I PLAYED HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL. AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT THE EQUIPMENT BACK WHEN I WAS PLAYING. WAS PROBABLY MUCH MORE INFERIOR -- THAN THE EQUIPMENT THAT'S BEING USED TODAY. ANNA AND I REMEMBER -- THE TOUGHNESS ESPECIALLY DURING WHAT WE CALLED HELL WEEK. AND I REMEMBER SOME OF MY FRIENDS. THAT WERE TAKEN SOME PRETTY TOUGH SHOTS. AND I REMEMBER A PARTICULAR CASE WHERE. A VERY CLOSE FRIEND OF MINE -- GOT A HORRIFIC HEADACHE AFTER -- HIT WAS -- HAD A LITTLE BIT OF BLURRED VISION HAD A FEVER. OF COURSE NOBODY RECOGNIZE CITY HAD A CONCUSSION. AND WHEN HE WAS COMPLAINING TO THE COACHES THAT HE NEEDED SOME. ASSISTANCE -- THEY THEY CRITICIZED HIM. STOPPING TOUGH ENOUGH YOU GOT TO BE TOUGH TO PLAY FOOTBALL YOU GOT A SUSTAIN -- SOME DISCOMFORTS TO TO PLAY THE BALL SO -- I THINK YOU'RE LEGISLATION-IS IS IS GOOD -- I THINK IT'S GOING TO SAVE SOME SUPPLIES -- SPECIALLY WITH -- IN A COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT -- IN THE MOST EXTREME CASE OF PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL PLAYERS -- TAKING THEIR OWN LIVES -- BUT A QUESTION FOR OUR PROFESSIONAL. CAN YOU TELL US HOW THE TECHNOLOGY WITH HELMET -- CONSTRUCTION TODAY IS. MORE ADVANCED AND DO WE HAVE A STILL A LONG WAYS TO GO TO A REALLY BUT FOR THE BRAIN IF YOU WILL FROM. SOME OF THESE UNEXPECTED HAD SET UP ALL THE TRAINING IN THE WORLD JUST YOU KNOW KINETICS IS CONNECTICUT'S RIGHT SO -- WHAT ELSE COULD WE BE DOING TO PROTECT OUR KIDS? THANKS FOR THE QUESTION CENTER -- SO COUPLE THINGS -- WHEN I START WHEN I FIRST STARTED PLAN AS A CHILD I WERE SUSPENSION ON IT? TWO STRAPS. WITH PLASTIC OVER TOP OF IT -- NOT RELEASED TESTED CERTIFIED STANDARDS WERE ARE THE WILD WILD WEST -- NOWADAYS THERE'S BEEN INCREDIBLE ADVANCEMENTS IN THE TECHNOLOGY OF THE HELMET -- VIRGINIA TECH HAS A FIVE STAR RATING PROCESS THAT THEY RUN INDEPENDENT. AND IN THEIR LABS AND THAT THAT'S REALLY THE GOLD STANDARD FOR WHAT HOW MUCH SHOULD BE PURCHASED OR NOT PURCHASED IT CETERA -- THEY PUBLISH AT EVERY YEAR THIS YEAR THEY ANNOUNCED FOR THE FIRST TIME THEY THEY ACTUALLY RAN A A CERTIFICATION PROCESS SPECIFICALLY FOR YOUTH HELMETS. FIRST TIME THEY'D EVER DONE THAT UP UNTIL THEN THEY THEY WERE DOING IT AT THE VARSITY YEAR THAT PROFESSIONAL LEVEL -- SO THERE ARE A LOT TO CHOICES VERY AFFORDABLE CHOICES -- FOR FOR FOR FAMILIES -- TO THE BALLOT TECHNOLOGIES IT'S QUITE ADVANCED -- BUT I ALSO WANT TO COMMENTED THE HELMET IS THE IS THE LAST POINT A DEFENSE. IT'S IT'S REALLY IT'S IT'S IT'S THE GOAL HERE IS TO EDUCATE COACHES AND PARENTS EMPLOYERS. ON HOW TO PLAY TACKLE FOOTBALL SAFELY. AND REMOVE THE HEAD FROM PLAYING AND YOU DO THAT BY TEACHING TECHNIQUES. BLOCKING DEFEATING THE BLOCK TACKLING TECHNIQUES THAT MINIMIZE THE HEAD IMPLY. RIGHT TO THE HELMETS TO HELMETS GOTTEN A LOT BETTER AND IT'S NOT WE'RE NOT COACHING OR TEACHING THINGS LIKE DON'T WORRY YOU CAN RUN HARDER IN THE END INTO THINGS BECAUSE OF A BETTER HELMET. THE HELMET IS A LAYER OF PROTECTION AND RELEASE IN EDUCATION AWARENESS A CULTURAL SHIFT THEY WERE DRIVING -- ACROSS CALIFORNIA -- THIS IS REALLY GOING TO IT'S A COMBINATION OF THOSE TWO PLUS FOR STATE THINGS LIKE THAT THAT REALLY GOING TO ARE GOING. TO HAVE SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS OF THE ALSO -- ADDRESSING THE THE FACE CARDS -- WHAT WHEN I WAS PLAYING I WAS A SPLIT AND SO I HAD JUST BASICALLY A VERY SMALL FACE CARD AND? I ACTUALLY HAD A SIGNIFICANT INJURY WERE -- I WAS A DEFENSIVE AND IT HAD MADE A TACKLE AND ENDED UP CRASHING THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE CARTILAGE OF MY NOSE TO POINT WHERE WAS FLAT AND I ACTUALLY HAD TO GO IN. FOR SURGERY TO HAVE IT FIXED NOW THAT COULD'VE BEEN MUCH MORE SERIOUS IF I WOULD TAKE A MORE FRONTAL -- HIT AND IT WOULD HAVE. LODGED INTO THE THE BRAIN OR OR THE A MORE SERIOUS INJURY ALL TOGETHER WITH THE BONE BUT I'M HOPING THAT THEY'RE ALSO TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE THE THE FACIAL EXPOSURE. AND ENSURING THAT WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN TO PROTECT THEIR THEIR FACIAL INTEGRITY AND SENSITIVITY OF THOSE AREAS AS WELL YES SO -- FACE MASKS ARE THE COOL THING ON THE FOOTBALL FIELD. LOTS OF CHOICES LOTS A DIFFERENT FACE MASTER. ON HELMETS -- AND THE OTHER THING I WOULD SAY IS THAT YOU KNOW THERE'S THERE'S NEW THERE REALLY LIGHT HELMETS. RIGHT SO YOU CAN GET A FIVE STAR RATING OF FOUR POUNDS YOU CAN GET A FIVE STAR RATING HELMET TWO POINT FOUR POUNDS RIGHT SO THERE'S LOTS OF AFFORDABLE CHOICES GREAT TECHNOLOGY THAT. INCLUDING. BALANCING AND CHANGING THE FACE MASK TO BALANCE THE WEIGHT SO THAT -- IT RESTS ON THE HEAD AS AS EFFECTIVELY AS POSSIBLE -- WITH ALL KINDS OF DIFFERENT CONFIGURATIONS OF THE FACE MASK THAT GUARD THE ICE AS WELL AS WELL AS CLEAR SHIELDS. IN THURSDAY AND HAVE THESE WHEN YOU AND I WERE PLAN BUT SHIELDS YOU CAN GET FOR A LOT OF RUNNING BACKS AND DEFENSIVE LINEMAN WILL GET. A CLEAR SHIELD. SO THAT YOU CAN STILL SEE THE EYES FROM A SAFETY PERSPECTIVE BUT ELIMINATES. ABOUT WHAT SOUNDS B. LIKE THE INJURY THE U. SUSTAINED I KNOW YOU AND I TALKED BEFORE AND I I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR PASSION AND HELPING US GET HERE TODAY AND I APPRECIATE. THAT SOME WOMEN COOPER IS CARRIED THE LEGISLATION THAT I KNOW IS GOING -- TO EFFECTUALLY BETTER QUALITY OF LIFE TO MAKE THE SAVE THE SPORT A LOT SAFER FOR OUR YOUNG KIDS. TO PARTICIPATE IN AND HAVING TO MOVE IT AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. I THANK YOU I JUST COULDN'T MAKE IT BRIEF PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT WITH HER NEXT QUESTION IS THAT FOR THE STAFF WERE WATCHING WE ARE ONLY ONE MEMBER SHORT OF A QUORUM SO I KNOW MANY PEOPLE ARE AT OTHER COMMITTEES BUT IF YOU HAVE THIS. YEAR'S YOUR MEMBER HAPPENS TO BE AVAILABLE PLEASE AND IN DOWN HERE SO WITH THAT -- SIR MITCHELL. YOU ARE I'M CURIOUS -- THE WITNESS TALKED ABOUT CULTURE SHIFT AND IT'S CLEARLY GONNA REQUIRE CULTURE CHEF I SUPPORTED. A MORE AGGRESSIVE -- A BILL LAST YEAR BUT MY MY QUESTION IS -- DOES THE BILL HAVE ANY TEETH IN IT HOW ARE YOU GOING -- TO MAKE SURE THAT IN IN IN IN THAT INDEED PRACTICES ARE LIMITED TO THIRTY MINUTES A DAY AND NO MORE THAN TWO TIMES A WEEK WHAT WHAT'S THE CONSEQUENCE. IF THEY EXCEED THAT I WORK WITH FORTUNE FIVE HUNDRED COMPANIES ALL OVER THE WORLD I WORKED ON FIVE CONTINENTS IN HELPING THEM RESPOND TO BUSINESS MODEL SHIPS. DRIVE CULTURE CHANGE -- STRUCTURAL CHANGE LEADERSHIP DYNAMICS ALL THAT -- FUN STUFF -- OUR BILL IS MODELED AFTER THREE PREVIOUS BILLS -- AB TWENTY ONE TWENTY SEVEN WHICH THE COOLEY ACT LIMITED FULL CONTACT IN HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL. AB TWO THOUSAND SEVEN WHICH WAS CALIFORNIA'S VERSION OF ALLY STATE LAW WHICH MANDATED CONCUSSION EDUCATION AND AND FACT SHEETS. AND AB TWENTY EIGHT HUNDRED FROM ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHIU WHICH WHICH BASICALLY PROVIDED THE SAME MANDATES AROUND HE ACCLAMATION. TO OUR THERE THERE THERE IS NO -- PUNITIVE CLAUSE OR THINGS LIKE THAT AND IN OUR BILL -- WE MODELED EVANS WHEN PEOPLE EXCEED THE THIRTY MINUTE PRACTICES IN PRACTICE MORE THAN TWO TIMES A WEEK SO. THAT'S GOING TO BE -- THE PARENTS. WE HAVE AN INNOVATIVE DESIGN IN OUR BILL. THAT IS THAT EXCEEDS THE OF THE THE PREVIOUS BILLS STANDARDS AROUND OVERSIGHT AND THAT INNOVATIVE STANDARD IS EACH ORGANIZATION CALIFORNIA THAT RUNS A FOOTBALL PROGRAM IS GOING TO HAVE -- TO PUBLISH THEIR COMMITMENT AB ONE THAT THEY ARE COMPLYING WITH AB. ONE WE'RE CREATING HEALTHY TENSION THE MARKET. THERE'S A LOT OF COMPETITION FOR PLAYERS. AND SO BY CREATING THIS HEALTHY TENSION BY PUBLISHING ARE YOU AB ONE A COMPLIANT OR NOT. PARENTS OWN RESPONSIBILITY TO TAKE PUT THEIR KIDS IN THE SAFEST POSSIBLE SITUATION. AND THE PARENTS ARE GONNA THEN CHOOSE I'M GONNA GO WITH A BEAK ARE COMPLIANT ONE PROGRAM ON THIS SIDE OF THE STREET BECAUSE ONE OF THE OTHER SIDE OF STREET. IS IN COMPLIANCE AND WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN IS THOSE ORGANIZATIONS THAT DON'T STEP INTO SAFETY FROM A SECURITY PERSPECTIVE THEY'RE GONNA WITHER AND DIE. BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT GONNA HAVE THE PLAYERS. THANK YOU THE ICE NOTE THAT WE HAVE A QUORUM SO SURGERY CAN YOU PLEASE CALL THE ROLL HAND. AND IS HERE STONE. STONE HERE GONZALEZ GROVE. GROWTH HERE HER TATO HER TITLE HERE LEYVA LEYVA HERE MITCHELL MITCHELL HERE MONNING RUBIO. HEY WE HAVE A QUORUM OTHER QUESTIONS FOR THE AUTHOR. WITH THE BILL OKAY IT'S BEEN MOVED BY CENTER SO SO -- COOPER FIRST OF ALL I WANT I DO WANNA THANK YOU FOR BRINGING FORWARD THIS BILL AND I KNOW THAT THIS. IS THAT WHEN THE SWIMMING THIS BILL PASSES -- THAT TO IT WILL SET YOU KNOW -- STANDARDS THAT BEYOND THAT BASICALLY SO. PLACE CALIFORNIA LEADERSHIP ROLE IN TERMS OF STANDARDS AROUND THE YOUTH FOOTBALL -- A IS THAT I WOULD WANT TO PUT A PERHAPS -- ONE CAT THE ODD WHICH IS IS THAT EVEN THOUGH THESE WILL BE -- THE LEADING STANDARDS I THINK IT'S STILL IMPORTANT TO BECAUSE I THINK WE STILL HAVE INCOMPLETE INFORMATION ABOUT -- WHAT'S THE LONG TERM IMPACTS OF YOU KNOW I'M TALKING TO YOUNG PEOPLE. IT WHO ARE PARTICIPATING IN A CONTACT SPORT WHERE THEY MAY DEVELOP INJURIES I APPRECIATE THAT THERE WERE TALKING ABOUT CULTURE CHANGE I'D REALLY APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT THERE WAS CONVERSATION ABOUT. HOW THE HELMET IS REALLY THE LAST TO LATER OF PROTECTION THAT ACTUALLY THE FIRST THING IS WE? KEEP THE HEAD OUT OF PLAY THAT'S I THINK A VERY IMPORTANT THING AND AND CERTAINLY ONE ALSO RECOGNIZE WE HEARD FROM MANY OF THE SUPPORTERS THE BENEFITS NOW WE DON'T LIKE NOR THE BENEFITS OF PARTICIPATING IN TEAM SPORT PARTICIPATE IN FOOTBALL THE MOTIVATION IT GIVES MANY USE AND SO. FORTH AND THE LESSONS THEY LEARNED FROM FOOTBALL ITSELF -- BUT SO JUST TWICE A IS THAT IT'S STILL IMPORTANT EVEN WITH THIS BILL AND I APPRECIATE AGAIN THIS IS A FORD BUT LOOKING BILL THAT WE ALSO INSURE THAT WE HAVE -- THEY'LL CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE HEALTH OF THESE -- THESE CHILDREN AS THEY GROW UP AND IF THERE'S FOR THE END OF THIS. THERE'S FURTHER STEPS NEED TO BE TAKEN TO PROTECT THEIR HEALTH AND THAT -- WE STILL NEED TO BE OPEN TO THAT SO. I GUESS THE OTHER ISSUE I DID WHY ASK ME QUESTION ABOUT WILL WE DID HERE FOR THE OPPOSITION FROM THE CATHOLIC TRAINERS OF TWEENER FROM THAT THANK TRAINERS -- DIETERS IN WHAT THEY WHAT THEY WANT TO BE INCLUDED THAT LESS BUT WITH THIS BILL ACTUALLY PRECLUDE ATHLETIC TRAINERS FROM ACTUALLY BEING AT PRACTICE THAT'S NOT HOW I READ THE BILL BUT MAYBE YOU CAN CLEAR -- THAT ISSUE -- IN TERMS OF THE ROLE OF ATHLETIC TRAINERS AND USE OF ALL THAT WAS BROUGHT BY THE OPPOSITION. PARTY WIENER I SHOULD SAY NOT REALLY OPPOSITION IF I MAY STOP THE PRACTICE AT C. ISSUE IT'S THE GAME -- AT WHEN THEY SAY SOMEONE HAS TO BE PRESENT AT THE GAME IT'S A LICENSED -- RIGHT INTENTIONALLY AT PRACTICE IS SOMEONE WHO HAS FIVE OR SIX HOURS OF TRAINING -- WISH IF THAT OKAY OKAY WITH YOU BUT THAT OKAY WELL I'M I DECIDE SO I DID TO STAFF. THE AUTHOR IS TO TRY AND REDUCE YOUR DOCTOR PAN I'D READ THAT WAY EITHER I WAS NOT AWARE OF THEIR CONCERNS PLAY THIS MORNING WE HAD HEARD FROM THEM. AND THE SKILLS INTRODUCED BACK IN DECEMBER SO IS THE FIRST I'VE HEARD I WON'T HAVE DISCUSSIONS WITH THE MISTER MORAN. TO CONCERNS OKAY SELVES SO WILL THE THE THE THE V. SOME FURTHER DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THAT AND AGAIN APPRECIATE WE TRIED TO THE BILL. OKAY SO THE BILL'S BEEN MOVED NO OTHER COMMENTS -- ITS BID THE MOTION IS TO PASS SO I GUESS GOES STRAIGHT TO THE FLOOR IS THE NEXT STEP. OKAY WELCOME AND I BELIEVE YOU HAVE ITEM NUMBER. FIVE EIGHTY FOUR FIFTY ONE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN SENATORS. IF YOU WANT TO START BY THANKING YOUR STAFF FOR WORKING WITH MY OFFICE AND THE SPONSOR. I'M SUBMITTING AUTHORS AMENDMENTS TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT PHYSICIANS. HAS DETERMINED THE PATIENT IS STABLE AND APPROPRIATE FOR TRANSFERRED TO THE PSYCHIATRIC FACILITY. AND THIS IS NOTED IN THE PATIENT'S MEDICAL RECORD. THESE A MAN'S ALSO CLARIFIED THAT THE RECEIVING FACILITY HAS AN AVAILABLE BED. AND ADDS PSYCHIATRIC HELP FACILITIES TO AN EXISTING PROVISION OF A LAW PROHIBITING THE RECEIVING FACILITY FROM REQUIRING A PATIENT. TO BE ON A FIFTY ONE FIFTY HOLD IF THEY ARE VOLUNTARILY SEEKING PSYCHIATRIC TREATMENT. AB FOR FIFTY ONE WAS INTRODUCED TO HELP AN INDIVIDUAL EXPERIENCING. AN EMERGENT MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS OBTAINS ACCESS TO APPROPRIATE AND TIMELY CARE. M. TALL -- WHICH WAS THE EMERGENCY MEDICAL TREATMENT AND ACTIVE LABOR ACT OF NINETEEN SEVENTY THREE IS A FEDERAL LAW THAT REQUIRES HOSPITAL EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS TO MEDICALLY SCREEN EVERY PATIENT TO SIX EMERGENCY CARE. AND TO STABILIZE FOR TRANSFER THOSE WITH MEDICAL EMERGENCIES REGARDLESS OF THEIR HEALTH INSURANCE STATUS OR ABILITY TO PAY. FEDERAL LAW IMPOSES THIS REQUIREMENT ON ANY HOSPITAL THAT PARTICIPATES IN MEDICARE. WE ALSO HAVE STATE AND TALLER. THAT IMPOSES THIS REQUIREMENT ON ANY HOSPITAL THAT OPERATES AN EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT. INDIVIDUALS AND A ENTAL HEALTH CRISIS MAY SEEK CARE AT THE NEAREST EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT. AFTER AN EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT AFTER A VISIT. BY PHYSICIANS JUST LIKE ME. WE SEE INDIVIDUALS WHO MAY NEED HIGHER LEVEL OF PSYCHIATRIC SERVICES AND REQUIRE A TRANSFERRED TO A PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL. HOWEVER MERGING SEE POSITIONS HAVE EXPERIENCED TROUBLE TRANSFERRING PATIENTS TO PSYCHIATRIC PERSONAL FACILITIES. THAT DO NOT HAVE AN EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT. THERE IS A CONCERN. THAT SOME PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITALS ARE USING LANGUAGE IN CURRENT LAW. WHICH ONLY APPLIES TO CALIFORNIA HOSPITALS THAT MAINTAIN AND OPERATE AN EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT. AS A WAY TO NOT ACCEPT ALL PATIENTS. THIS IS SOMETHING I'VE SEEN FIRST HAND. AND WHEN YOU'RE SEEING SOMEONE WHO'S IN A MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS RIGHT THERE IN FRONT OF YOU. I THINK WE HAVE TO HELP TO SOLVE THOSE PROBLEMS HERE TODAY. AND THAT'S WHAT I BELIEVE THIS BILL DOES. BECAUSE OF PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITALS AVOID TAKING PATIENTS IT LIMITS ACCESS. TO CARE AND REDUCES CAPACITY OF ALREADY SCARCE RESOURCES. THESE BEDS SHOULD BE AVAILABLE TO ALL PATIENTS FACING A MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS. REGARDLESS OF AN INDIVIDUAL'S INSURANCE STATUS OR ABILITY TO PAY. AB FOR FIFTY ONE REMOVES BARRIERS AND CURRENT LAW SO AN INDIVIDUAL WITH A MENTAL HEALTH CONDITION HAS TIMELY ACCESS TO ADDITIONAL CARE AND SERVICES THAT MAY BE NEEDED. IT REQUIRES. ONE PSYCHIATRIC UNITS WITH A GENERAL ACUTE CARE HOSPITAL. TO PSYCHIATRIC HEALTH FACILITIES AND THREE ACUTE PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITALS REGARDLESS OF WHETHER IT MAINTAINS AN EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT. TO PROVIDE EMERGENCY SERVICES AND CARE TO TREAT A PERSON WITH THE PSYCHIATRIC EMERGENCY MEDICAL CONDITION. IF THEY THE TREATING PHYSICIAN HAS DETERMINED THAT THE PATIENT IS MEDICALLY STABLE FOR TRANSFER. THAT THE FACILITY HAS AN AVAILABLE BEDAND THAT THE FACILITY HAS APPROPRIATE FACILITIES AND QUALIFIED PERSONNEL AVAILABLE TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES OF CARE. WITH ME TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF AB FOR FIFTY ONE IS TO MATT AND WITH THE CALIFORNIA CHAPTER OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF EMERGENCY PHYSICIANS. THANK YOU WITNESSES SUPPORT. DOCTOR MEMBERS TO MADDEN REPS IN CALIFORNIA CHAPTER THE MIRACLES EMERGENCY PHYSICIANS WE ARE THE SPONSOR I THINK DOCTOR IN REAL -- EFFICIENTLY EFFECTIVELY OUTLINED THE ISSUE THAT WE'RE RUNNING INTO ON A SOMEWHAT REGULAR BASIS I'LL MAKE MYSELF AVAILABLE FOR ANY QUESTIONS OR RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR IVAN.

GOOD AFTERNOON TURN MEMBERS TYLER IN THE WITH THE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION -- FIRST OF ALL I'D LIKE TO THANK THE ON AUTHORS STAFF AND THE ON CHAIR AND CHAIR STAFF TO FOR WORKING US ON NAM ADDRESSING SOME OF OUR CONCERNS ON THE BILL. HOWEVER UNFORTUNATELY WE HAVE BEEN OPPOSING WHITES AMENDED STILL ON THIS BILL -- THIS BILL HAS GOOD INTENTIONS BUT SOME SIGNIFICAN UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES IN THE WAY THAT RE READ IT -- BY AND REQUIRING FACILITIES TO ACCEPT PSYCHIATRIC PATIENTS EXPERIENCING A PSYCHIATRIC CRISIS WITHOUT CONSIDERATION OF ESTABLISH COUNTY OR NETWORKS -- THIS WILL CREATE SIGNIFICANT -- CARE COORDINATION ISSUES TRANSFER INTO VISUALS WITH THE NEXT SERIOUS TURN ACUTE MENTAL ILLNESS IN CRISIS OUTSIDE OF COUNTY OR NETWORK. CAN STREAM AT THE COORDINATION OF TREATMENT WITH THE FAMILY AND LOVED ONES CAN THE INCLUSION OF THE OUTPATIENT CURRENT OUTPATIENT PROVIDER. AND THEN CREATES DIFFICULTY IN TRANSFERRING THAT INDIVIDUAL BACK TO THEIR COUNTY OR THEIR PLACE OF RESIDENCE AT THE END OF THEIR TREATMENT. WITH ADDITIONALLY THIS LEGISLATION AND I READ TO CIRCUMVENT SETS A VERY CRITICAL PART -- PSYCHIATRIC CARE IN CALIFORNIA WHERE WE HAVE ESTABLISHED WITH THE INVESTMENT A MENTAL HEALTH WELLNESS ACTIVE TWENTY THIRTEEN CRISIS STABILIZATION UNITS. AND BY REQUIRING AN INDIVIDUAL TO BE ACCEPTED FROM A IN EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS WITHOUT GOING TO A CRISIS STABILIZATION UNIT. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL IS CIRCUMVENTING A VERY CRITICAL -- PART OF THAT CARE CONTINUE. ONE AND THAT CRISIS STABILIZATION UNITS HAVE PROVIDE TWENTY FOUR SEVEN CARE TO INDIVIDUALS IN CRISIS AND THAT THEY HAVE REDUCE TOPS BUT REALIZATION. THEY REDUCE LAW ENFORCEMENT CONTACT AND SAVES LIVES SO FOR THESE REASONS WE REMAIN OPPOSED UNLESS AMENDED ON THIS LEGISLATION AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AND LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING CONTINUE DISCUSSION WITH THE AUTHORS OFFICE.

AND THE WAY FOR US TO CORRECT THIS AS A STATUS TO DEAL WITH THE CORE ISSUE WHICH IS STATE I'M TALLER. AND HOW WE MAKE SURE THAT IT MATCHES FEDERAL IN TALLINN BRING PARITY TO THIS. I BELIEVE IF THESE WERE ANY OTHER PATIENTS BUT MENTAL HEALTH PATIENTS THIS WOULD ALREADY BE SOLVED. AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO TREAT THEM AS EVERY OTHER PATIENT GETS TREATED AN EMERGENCY MEDICAL CONDITION. OKAY THANK YOU -- SO -- I I WOULD NATIONALLY I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE CONCERNS ARE RATE BY THE EVER HEALTH DIRECTORS -- AYE I WOULD ALSO MAKE NOTE AGAIN WE'RE TALKING MEMBER JUST SEE SITUATIONS -- SO I'D HEARD SHELVE FURTHER DIALOGUE BUT I THINK WE YOU KNOW I THINK FUNDAMENTALLY THE ISSUE IS ABOUT. HIS EMERGENCY SITUATIONS BE SURE PEOPLE ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH CARE I'VE SEEN YOU KNOW PEOPLE PILED UP IN EMERGENCY ROOMS. TO NOT GETTING TO MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT THEY NEED BECAUSE THERE'S NO PLACE FOR THEM TO GO AND AND THE SO WE NEED TO FEET FACILITATE -- THEM GETTING CARE WITH THAT SO -- WITH THAT -- DID YOU HAVE ANY FOR THE CLOTHES.

WELCOME I KNOW SHE'S YOU PUT YOUR YOUR FIRST OKAY. NUMBER EIGHTY EIGHTY FIVE SIXTY SEVEN THANK YOU WELCOME. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. AND MEMBERS HAPPY TO BE HERE TO PRESENT AB. FIVE SIXTY SEVEN WHICH ESTABLISHES A LONG TERM CARE INSURANCE TASK FORCE CONVENED BY THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER COMMISSIONER THE PURPOSES TO THROUGHOUT THE TASK FORCE IS TO PROVIDE EXPERT RECOMMENDATIONS. ON THE COMPONENTS NECESSARY TO ESTABLISH A STATE WIDE LONG TERM CARE INSURANCE. PROGRAM IN CALIFORNIA ESSENTIALLY WHAT WE'RE DOING IS WE'RE CREATING IS AT THE TASK FORCING LET LAST ABOUT TWO YEARS. TO FIGURE OUT IF IT'S-APPROPRIATE FOR US TO CONSIDER A PUBLIC OPTION WHEN IT COMES A LONG TERM CARE INSURANCE. LONG TERM CARE INSURANCE COSTS CONTINUE TO SKYROCKET BECAUSE THE LACK OF PROVIDERS WHO USED TO BE OVER A HUNDRED PROVIDERS OF LONG TERM CARE INSURANCE. CROSS COUNTRY NOW WE'RE CLOSER TO TEN TO TWELVE PROVIDERS THAT'S BECAUSE COSTS TO GO -- I WORK ON THIS ISSUE FOR A LOT OF DIFFERENT REASONS A BIG REASON IS THAT I'M A MILLENNIAL. IT WAS MY FAMILY THAT -- MY PARENTS WENT THROUGH THIS RECESSION IN A WAY THAT IMPACTED IT'S GONNA HAVE A LONG TERM IMPACT ON ME AND MY FROM MY GENERATION I THINK ON ALL THIS BUT SPECIFICALLY ON MY GENERATION. AND THAT IMPACT IS GOING TO BE IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW MY MOM MY STEP DAD WAS STARTING A BUSINESS RIGHT WHEN THE ECONOMY WENT DOWN. THEY DON'T KNOW HOW LONG WAS GOING TO BE THEY PUT ALL OF THEIR RETIREMENT ALL OF THEIR SAVINGS ABSOLUTELY EVERY SINGLE PENNY AND TO KEEP IN THE BUSINESS ALIVE. THEY COULDN'T DO A LONG ENOUGH TO NOT ONLY DID THEY LOSE ALL THEIR RETIREMENT ALL THAT RETIREMENT SECURITY THEY ALSO LOST THEIR HOME. SO YOU KNOW IF SOMETHING WERE TO HAPPEN YEAH MY STEP DAD HE'S GONNA BE WORKING THE DAY HE DIES AND MY MOM. SOMETHINGHAPPENS -- FALLS ON ME AND MY MY SIBLINGS TO PICK UP THAT. OF RESPONSIBILITY WHICH WE GLADLY WILL DO BUT IT'S IT'S IT'S IMPORTANT THAT. IN THE EVENT THAT -- YOU KNOW THOSE CAN AFFORD SOME TYPE OF INSURANCE TO PREPARE FOR ANY ISSUES THAT COULD ARISE LATER ON IN LIFE. OF THEIR NEEDS TO BE AN AFFORDABLE OPTION I THINK IT'S INCUMBENT UPON US AT LEAST KNOW WHAT WE'RE WALKING INTO. AND THAT THERE BE SOME RESEARCH IN TERMS OF ESTABLISHING A PUBLIC OPTION ON I KNOW YOU'RE WORKING ON THIS ISSUE SENATOR PAN HERE'S MORE LONG TERM. AND WE'RE THIS IS SHORT TERM AND AND AND JUST FIGURING OUT THE VIABILITY OF A OF A OF A PUBLIC OPTION SO WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE WITH ME TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT. IS ON WAR FROM THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION. I THANK YOU WELCOME THE FIRST IS A SPORT. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS -- AND MISTER CHAIR AS í THE COMPANY'S GOING PLACES ASSOCIATION AND I AM HERE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF AB -- FIVE SIXTY SEVEN WE KNOW TRAGEDY CAN STRIKE AT ANYTIME AND ANYBODY CAN FIND THEMSELVES NEEDING LONG TERM CARE -- WHICH CAN BE DEVASTATING FINANCIALLY SO THE LACK OF AN AFFORDABLE OPTION FOR LONG TERM CARE IT'S A BIG CONCERN FOR MY MEMBERS WHO ARE AT THE LOWEST WORKERS ON IN OUR SCHOOLS. ON AVERAGE A FULL TIME CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEE EARNS TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR AND A PART TIME EMPLOYEE EARNS JUST THIRTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR -- THE MAJORITY OF MY MEMBERS ARE PART TIME EMPLOYEES AND SOME OF THEM MUST WORK TWO THREE JOBS JUST TO GET BY DATE. FIVE DAY TODAY -- AFTER PAYING FOR THEIR BASIC NECESSITIES A LONG TERM CARE IS LONG TERM CARE INSURANCE IS SIMPLY NOT AN OPTION OR ARE OUT OF REACH FOR MOST ABOUT. ALSO -- MANY OF THEM JUST ASSUMED THAT LONG TERM CARE IS PART OF THE NORMAL HEALTH INSURANCE THAT THE A MAY HAVE. SO IT'S UNTIL THEY NEEDED THAT THEY REALIZE IT'S NOT PART OF THE REGULAR HEALTH INSURANCE AND THEN THAT'S ALSO THE TIME IN WHICH THEY LEARN HOW EXPENSIVE LONG TERM CARE CAN BE -- IT'S NOT UNCOMMON FOR LONG TERM CARE TO COST UP TO SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH OR EVEN MORE AND MANY. MANY PEOPLE CANNOT AFFORD THIS PRICE -- SO THEY END UP HAVING TO USE A THEIR SAVINGS OR DEPLETE ANY ASSETS THAT THEY HAVE -- OTHER PEOPLE HAVE TO RELY ON FAMILIES AND THE STATE. TO TAKE CARE OF THEM. HELLO IF THIS HAPPENS SO WE RECOGNIZE THAT THE SYSTEM IS BROKEN AND THE THIS NEEDS TO BE FIXED AND SO AB FIVE SIXTY SEVEN IS THE FIRST AND NECESSARY STEP IN ADDRESSING THIS ISSUE. SO WE ASKED FOR AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU OTHER WITH THIS IS A SUPPORT. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN PAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ON GEHRY PASSED MORE FROM THE CONGRESS OF CALIFORNIA SENIORS.

TEN EIGHTY SEVEN SIXTY THREE WELCOME THANK YOU MISTER MEMBERS. THANK YOU THE STAFF THAT WORK ON THE BILL ALL BE ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE'S PROPOSED TACTICAL MOMENTS. AB SEVEN SIX THREE MEMBERS SIMPLE BILL THAT WILL. INCREASE ACCESS TO SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR CHILDREN THE MEDICARE PROGRAM BY STANDARDIZED FORMS COUNTIES REQUIRE CONTRACTING PROVIDERS TO USE THIS ALLOWS DOCSIS SPEND LESS TIME DOING PAPERWORK AND MORE TIME HELPING CHILDREN. I HAVE ONE OF THE BEST CHILDREN'S HOSPITALS IN THE COUNTRY -- RIGHT OUTSIDE OF MY DISTRICT AND THAT'S HOW THIS BILL CAME TO MY ATTENTION RESPECTFULLY REQUEST DRIVE BUT WE HAVE TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT. YOU THAT SOME AWARENESS SUPPORT THANK YOU MAYOR MARTIN HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION INCLUDING DALY CHILDREN OUTSIDE OF THE MEMBERS DISTRICT. AND AND ALL OF OUR MEMBER HOSPITALS HAVE CONTRACTS WITH COUNTIES TO PROVIDE SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES TO CHILDREN IN THE MEDI CAL PROGRAM AND WHEN WE STARTED REACHING OUT TO THOSE FOLKS LAST YEAR TO LEARN MORE ABOUT WHAT THEY NEEDED. IN THE PAPER ALL SPACE THE PAPERWORK BURDEN ASSOCIATED WITH THAT WORK QUICKLY ROSE TO THE TOP OF THEIR LIST OF CONCERNS THEY INDICATED THEY THOUGHT IT TOOK ABOUT 4250% FOR OTHER PROVIDERS TIME JUST TO FILL OUT THE PAPERWORK ASSOCIATED WITH THIS CARE. BUT IT WAS ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS THAT THEY LOSE PSYCHIATRISTS AND PSYCHOLOGISTS ADD TO THIS WORK TO OTHER RESOURCES -- AND A LOT OF THAT IS JUST BECAUSE THERE'S SO MUCH VARIATION AMONGST THE DIFFERENT COUNTY SO YOU HAVE FIFTY SIX DIFFERENT SETS OF COUNTY PAPERWORK. MOST OF OUR HOSPITALS WORK WITH MORE THAN ONE COUNTY NOT PAPERWORK EVEN FOR THE INTAKE PACKET CAN RANGE FROM SIX OR SEVEN PAGES UP INTO TWENTY TWENTY FIVE PAGES -- AND OFTEN IT'S NOT ELECTRONICS SO THEY HAVE TO FILL IT OUT BY HAND -- AND BASICALLY THEY SAID IF WE COULD JUST FIX THE PAPERWORK PROBLEM WE COULD SEE 30% MORE KIDS AND THAT KIND OF BLEW MY MIND -- AND AT THAT POINT WE SAID LET'S SEE IF WE CAN DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS AND WE WERE GRATEFUL TO THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER FOR TAKING THE ISSUE ON I THINK ALSO I WOULD JUST ADD THAT NOT ONLY IS IT ABOUT THE BURDEN OF THE PAPER WORK BUT WE HAVE ACTUALLY. HEARD THAT A LOT OF THE PAPERWORK DOES NOT NECESSARILY INCLUDE THE APPROPRIATE STANDARD FOR MEDICAL NECESSITY AND IT IMPOSES ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS THAT MIGHT CREATE. INAPPROPRIATE BARRIERS TO CARE THAT CHILDREN ARE OTHERWISE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE AND SO WE THINK THAT AB SEVEN SIXTY THREE WILL HELP ADDRESS ALL OF THOSE ISSUES AND WE URGE YOU TO SUPPORT IT TODAY.

FOR YOU -- ITEM NUMBER NINE EIGHTY FIVE NINETY EIGHT AFTER ALL THESE SET PARENTS AND CHILDREN TESTIFIED IN FAVOR OF THE BILL IT'LL GET NOTICEABLY QUIETER IN THE HEARING ROOM MISTER CHAIR. BUT I WANT TO UPDATE YOU ALL A GOOD AFTERNOON AND TO FOR START OUT BY YEAH THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN YOUR STAFF FOR WORKING SO HARD WITH MYSELF AND MY STAFF ON A SERIES OF AMENDMENTS WERE TAKING ALL OF THOSE AMENDMENTS SO I IMAGINE I'LL BE TAKEN IN THAT. IN THE NEXT COMMITTEE -- AS A MATTER OF FORMALITY -- BUT THIS BILL IS ABOUT A CHILD'S ABILITY TO HEAR -- AND THAT SHOULD NOT BE I'M SURE WE ALL AGREE DETERMINED BY ONE'S FAMILY INCOME YET HERE IN CALIFORNIA THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF FAMILIES THAT HAVE TO PAY FOR THEIR CHILD'S HEARING AIDS OUT OF POCKET OR SIMPLY HAVE TO FOREGO THE MALL TOGETHER. AB FIVE NINETY EIGHT ADDRESSES THIS GAP IN COVERAGE BY REQUIRING HEALTH INSURANCE POLICIES TO INCLUDE COVERAGE FOR CHILDREN'S HEARING AIDS. THE COST OF HEARING AIDS IS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT BARRIER TO PARENTS SEEKING TO OBTAIN THEM FOR THEIR CHILDREN -- THESE -- DEVICES CAN COST UP TO SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR A PAIR AND GROWING CHILDREN NEED THEM TO BE REPLACED REGULARLY. WELL CALIFORNIA'S A LEADER ON MANY ISSUES ON THIS -- ONE SADLY WE LAGGED BEHIND MORE THAN TWENTY OTHER STATES THAT REQUIRE INSURANCE FOR PEDIATRIC HEARING AIDS. AB FIVE NINETY EIGHT WILL ENSURE THAT ALL CALIFORNIA CHILDREN REGARDLESS OF INCOME OR BACKGROUND HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR HEARING AIDS. AND HEARING AID SERVICES AND BILL ARE KIMBERLY WHEN A MOTHER OF FOR A HARD OF HEARING CHILD'S HERE WITH TWO OF HER CHILDREN. AND THE DOCTOR DILLON CHAN WHO IS ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR IN PEDIATRIC OTOLARYNGOLOGY OTOLARYNGOLOGY. UC SAN FRANCISCO AND I THINK THEY ARE -- THE BEST ADVOCATES FOR WHY THIS BILL IS ESSENTIAL IT IN ADDITION TO THOSE WHO YOU'LL BE HEARING FROM FROM THE PUBLIC. THANK YOU AND BEFORE WE BEGIN THE WITNESSES JUST WANNA CLARIFY AND APPRECIATE YOU TAKING THE MINISTER TAKING THEM IN THIS COMMITTEE CORRECT. YES OKAY. THANK YOU SORRY SO I TO CLARIFY THAT. THIS IS VERY ALL RIGHT THANK YOU WITH THIS IS A SUPPORT SIX MINUTES TOTAL FOR ALL THE WITNESSES SELL [inaudible] WELCOME. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OUT MY NAME IS DYLAN CHANNA PEDIATRIC OTOLARYNGOLOGY SO YOU SEE SAN FRANCISCO -- I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS CALIFORNIA REPRESENTING OVER FIVE THOUSAND PEDIATRICIAN STATEWIDE. IN SUPPORT OF AB. FIVE NINETY EIGHT MY FIRST ONE I THINK THE AUTHOR FOR ITS CONTINUED EFFORTS IN MOVING THIS BILL FORWARD -- SO ONE THOUSAND CHILDREN ARE BORN EVERY YEAR IN CALIFORNIA WITH HEARING LOSS. FOR THESE CHILDREN TO DEVELOP SPEECH IN SPOKEN LANGUAGE THE HEARING AIDS ARE AN ABSOLUTE MEDICAL NECESSITY. THERE IS OVERWHELMING EVIDENCE THAT FAILURE TO PROVIDE APPROPRIATE INTERVENTION TO DEAF AND HARD OF HEARING CHILDREN BY SIX MONTHS OF AGE. LEADS TO SPEECH LANGUAGE COGNITIVE EDUCATIONAL AND SOCIAL EMOTIONAL DEFICITS EVERY MONTH IN DELAY. IN STARTING HEARING AIDS DECREASES THEIR LONG TERM LANGUAGE POTENTIAL. FOR THIS REASON HEARING LOSS IS CONSIDERED A DEVELOPMENTAL EMERGENCY -- THE REQUIRES EARLY INTERVENTION TO PREVENT PERMANENT DELAYS -- CALIFORNIA WE SCREEN 99% OF OUR NEWBORNS FOR HEARING LOSS -- BUT SCREENING IS ONLY USEFUL IF IT CAN BE TO EARLY IN TIMELY INTERVENTION AND THAT'S WHERE WE'RE FAILING OUR CHILDREN -- ONLY 10% OF CALIFORNIA CHILDREN HAVE HEARING A COVERAGE THROUGH THE PRIVATE HEALTH PLANS. HEARING AIDS COST UP TO THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS EACH AND IN MY CLINIC -- I SEE HARD WORKING FAMILIES WHO SIMPLY CAN'T AFFORD THEM AND I ALSO SEE THE PERMANENT SPEECH AND LANGUAGE DELAYS THAT HAPPENED -- WHEN KIDS DON'T GET HEARING AIDS IN A TIMELY MANNER WHEN THEY HIT THEM -- THESE PREVENTABLE CONSEQUENCES ARE NOT ONLY DEVASTATING FOR THE CHILD IN THE FAMILY THERE ARE TREMENDOUS COST TO SOCIETY AND OUR TAXPAYERS. ON IT'S ESTIMATED THAT A WAS SINGLE CHILD BORN DEAF OR HARD OF HEARING -- COST TAXPAYERS UP TO ONE MILLION DOLLARS -- IN EDUCATIONAL COSTS FOR SUCH OCCASIONAL COSTS AND LOST PRODUCTIVITY -- IF THEY DON'T INTERVENTION AND TIME. SO WE NEED TO ACT NOW A DEVELOPMENTAL EMERGENCY IS REALLY EVOLVING RIGHT NOW -- FOR EVERY CHILD IN CALIFORNIA WITHOUT HEARING AIDS DUE TO INADEQUATE INSURANCE COVERAGE. OUR FIRST UP IS THE PAST EIGHTY FIVE NINETY EIGHT AND ENSURE THAT OUR DEFINITION HARD OF HEARING CHILDREN CAN ACCESS SOUND SO THAT THEY CAN LISTEN AND TALK. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. HELLO THANK YOU FOR HAVING US MY NAME IS KIMBERLY NEW AGAIN I AM A SINGLE DEAF MOTHER. WITH TWO CHILDREN THEY'RE BOTH HERE WITH ME. BOTH OF THEM ARE HARD OF HEARING AND THEY BOTH USE HEARING AIDS ON BOTH EARS. NOW MY GIRLS HEARING AIDS HAVE A HUGE IMPACT ON THEIR LIVES IT PROVIDES THEM WITH EQUAL ACCESS ALONG WITH SIGN LANGUAGE TO THEIR FAMILY AND PEERS. THEY LOVE MUSIC SINGING DANCING AND WATCHING MOVIES THEY'RE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE AND DO WELL IN SCHOOL HEARING AIDS ARE ESSENTIAL FOR THEIR SUCCESS. I WORK FULL TIME AND I HAVE INSURANCE I GUESS I AM CONSIDERED ONE OF THE LUCKY ONES. NINE OUT OF TEN INSURANCE COMPANIES DO NOT COVER HEARING AIDS AT ALL. MY CURRENT INSURANCE ONLY COVERS ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS TOTAL WHICH DOESN'T EVEN COVER THE COST OF ONE HEARING AID. MY CHILDREN'S HEARING AIDS CAN COST UP TO SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR THE TWO THAT THEY EACH NEED. THAT IS TWELVE THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR THE TWO OF THEM EVERY TIME NEW AGE ARE NEEDED. THIS DOES NOT INCLUDE THE EXPENSE OF YOUR MOLD AS THEY GROW OR BATTERIES. I AM THE SOLE FINANCIAL SUPPORT PROVIDER FOR MY GIRLS. YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT THIS IS A STRUGGLE FOR ME TO SUPPORT THEM. PAYING FOR HEARING AIDS IS A HUGE BUT NECESSARY MEDICAL NECESSITY FOR THEM. AB FIVE NINETY EIGHT WOULD BE A MAJOR HELP FOR MY FAMILY WHEN THIS BILL PASSES IT WILL LIFT OFF MY SHOULDERS THIS ENORMOUS EXPENSE. AND ALLOW ME TO SPEND MORE PRECIOUS MOMENTS WITH MY DAUGHTERS. MY DAUGHTER SOPHIE WROTE A PAPER CALLED ALL ABOUT MOM. SHE WROTE THAT I WORK TOO MUCH AND I'M ALWAYS TIRED AND STRESSED.

THANK YOU ALL RIGHT. THE WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. THE SAP ACTUAL HUMAN NEED TO MAKE SOME ROOM FOR THEM UP AT THE TABLE [inaudible] THIS WELCOME. GOOD AFTERNOON I'M JENNIFER ALLEY WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION HEALTH PLANS AND WE APPRECIATE YOU FOR YOUR TIME TO TESTIFY ON THIS BILL TODAY. WHAT WE SYMPATHIZE WITH HIS GROUP AND APPRECIATE THE EFFORTS TO LIMIT THE BENEFIT CAPTORS REMAIN OPPOSED TO THIS BILL? UNDER THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT -- STATES REQUIRED TO SELECT AN ESSENTIAL HEALTH BENEFITS PLAN. THAT DEFINES RELATED HEALTH SERVICES AND EQUIPMENT -- THE BENCHMARK PLAN SELECTED IN CALIFORNIA DID NOT INCLUDE HEARING AIDS -- PCA ALSO REQUIRE STATES TO COVER BENEFITS THAT EXCEED THE BENCHMARK PLAN. ACCORDING TO THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH BENEFITS REVIEW BOARD CHIPPER AB DOES EXCEED THE ESSENTIAL HEALTH BENEFITS AND TRIGGERS ADDITIONAL COSTS FOR THE STATE -- SEVERAL BENEFIT MANDATES HAVE BEEN PROPOSED IN THE LEGISLATURE IN RECENT YEARS. AND THIS ONE HAS RETURNED AGAIN AND OUR MEMBERS REMAIN CONCERNED ABOUT THE CUMULATIVE IMPACT. ON THE COST OF OF PREMIUM CITIES MANDATE BEEN THESE MANDATES HAVE. AND MULTIPLE SURVEYS SURVEYS CONFIRM THAT THE COST OF THE MONTHLY PREMIUM IS THE NUMBER ONE CONSUMER. CONCERN WHEN SELECTING A HEALTH PLAN. THUS FAR CALIFORNIA HAS DONE A BETTER JOB COMPARED TO MOST OTHER STATES IN KEEPING COVERAGE AFFORDABLE. AND WITH THE AVERAGE PREMIUM INCREASES BELOW OTHER STATES -- MAINTAINING AFFORDABLE PREMIUMS IS CRITICAL AS CRITICAL AS POLICY MAKERS STRIVE TO DECREASE THE NUMBER OF UNINSURED IN CALIFORNIA. AND SO AT THIS TIME WE DO NOT SUPPORT THIS BILL THANK YOU. SEVENTY WATKINS ON BEHALF OF THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA LIFE AND HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANIES WOULD FIRST LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE AND THE AUTHOR I KNOW% THAT THEY ATTEMPTED. TO NARROW THE BILL AND OUR HEARTS GO OUT CERTAINLY TO THE FAMILIES THAT ARE STRUGGLING IN THE HARD WORK THAT THEY DO ON BEHALF OF THEIR CHILDREN. UNFORTUNATELY WE ARE HERE TO TODAY IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL I THINK OUR MAIN CONCERN IS THERE WAS THAT. THERE WAS A PROCESS THE STATE IS -- CHOSEN A BENCHMARK PLAN TWICE. OUR OUR PRIMARY INTEREST WOULD BE TO HAVE THAT PROCESS PLAY OUT I KNOW THE ANALYSIS DID A WONDERFUL JOB OF KIND OF HIGHLIGHTING THAT THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE STATE MOVING FORWARD TO CHOOSE TO ELECT TO RE EVALUATE THE BENCHMARK PLAN. THERE WERE ALTERNATIVE OPTIONS THAT INCLUDED COVERAGE FOR HEARING AIDS WE WOULD SUGGEST THAT THAT HAVING THAT FRAMEWORK PUT IN PLACE AND UTILIZING THAT OPTION AS A WAY TO LOOK AT THIS BENEFIT AS WELL AS OTHERS -- AND TO CONSIDER THAT OPTION AND GOING FORWARD I KNOW THE ENOUGH TO SIT POINT OUT THAT WE HAVE UNTIL MAY OF TWENTY TWENTY TO NOTIFY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO ELECT -- FOR AND CONSIDER NEW BENCHMARK PLAN WOULD ALSO LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT WE ARE CONCERNED THAT THE BILL IS LIMITED. TO CHILDREN. WE HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE ANNOUNCES THAT TO BURKE DID BECAUSE I THINK THAT OUR CONCERN WOULD BE THAT THAT WOULD BE CONSIDERED DISCRIMINATORY AND WE WOULD HAVE TO COVER. HEARING AIDS FOR ALL INDIVIDUALS REGARDLESS OF AGE WHICH WOULD MEAN THAT THAT SUBURBAN ALICE'S AND THE NUMBERS THAT DENOTED TO THE PREMIUM IMPACTS WOULD NOT ACTUALLY BEAR OUT THE COST WOULD BE MORE SIGNIFICANT IF WE HAD TO COVER THEM FOR ALL AGE RANGES. SO WITH THOSE CONCERNS -- WE WOULD LIKE TO WORK WITH THE COMMITTEE AND POTENTIALLY HAVE THAT CONVERSATION ABOUT CONSIDERING -- AND I AM A REVIEW OF THE BENCHMARK PLAN GOING FORWARD BUT TODAY WE ARE OPPOSED TO THE BILL. HEY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION JOHN WINGER IBF AMERICA'S HEALTH INSURANCE PLANS AGIS ECHO THE COMMENTS CAPEN ACKLAND. OKAY THANK YOU. OKAY -- SIR MITCHELL I BELIEVE HE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS IF I MAY -- FIRST OF ALL SHAME ON US FOR FALLING SHORT IN SELECTING A BENCHMARK PLAN IT DIDN'T COVER IT SHAME ON US SO -- WHATEVER THE OUTCOME OF TODAY'S BILL THAT I WILL BE SUPPORTING THAT THAT THAT. DR PANELED LISTENING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE ENGAGED LITTLE MORE PRO ACTIVELY IN THAT PROCESS NEXT TIME WELL I FULLY APPRECIATE. THE NEED TO CREATE A SENSE OF BALANCE BETWEEN AFFORDABILITY AND COVERAGE COVERAGE ALSO HAS TO BE RELEVANT TO BE RELEVANT. AND TO A FAR GROUP YOU KNOW TO A LARGE NUMBER OF CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE -- HEARING IMPAIRED BOTH CHILDREN AND ADULTS -- I THINK THIS IS A FUNDAMENTAL -- ISSUE THAT I HOPE THAT WE'LL ALL ADDRESS. SECONDLY WITH REGARD TO pOF ALL LET ME I'M GLAD TO KNOW THAT IT IS A COVERED BENEFIT MEDI CAL YOU KNOW I'M ALWAYS THE FIRST ONE TO SAY THAT MEDI CAL IS A WONDERFULLY COMPREHENSIVE BENEFIT PACKAGE -- REGARDLESS OF THE NEGATIVE -- WRAP IT MAY TAKE ITS WONDERFULLY COMPREHENSIVE HERE'S AN EXAMPLE YET AGAIN OF WHERE IT PROVIDES COVERAGE -- FOR A GOOD NUMBER OF CALIFORNIANS WERE PRIVATE INSURANCE DOES NOT. BUT YOU DON'T IN MEDI CAL -- WILL BE ELIMINATED MANY OPTIONAL BENEFITS ONLY BEGAN TO INCREMENTALLY PUT THEM BACK OPTICAL WITH SOMETHING WE PUT BACK FOR CHILDREN FIRST AND JUST SUCCESSFULLY GOT IT IN FULLY FOR ADULTS THIS YEAR. AND SO I YOU KNOW I I QUESTION THE DISCRIMINATORY YOU KNOW CLAIM BECAUSE I APPRECIATE WHEN I TALK ABOUT MEDI CAL TODAY BUT WE HAVE DONE THAT AS A LEGISLATURE WE TOOK AND ACTION. PROVIDED A BENEFIT. TO A POPULATION AND NOT THE ENTIRE POPULATION AND SO IF SOMEONE COULD JUST PROVIDE ME SOME CLARITY ON ON THE DISCRIMINATORY CLAIM IF THAT'S TRULY VALID. SO -- LET ME IF I'M GONNA LET ME TRY TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION FOR SOMETHING THAT YOU AND I HAVE ONE MORE THAN I'M DONE THANK YOU -- SO. SO THE NATURE IS SO THAT THERE ISN'T A LAW -- SO BASICALLY WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT -- THERE CAN BE A CLAIM THAT IT MIGHT BE DISCRIMINATORY BECAUSE WE'RE ONLY DOING CHILDREN SO BECAUSE UNDER. BUT WE HAVE TO TREAT ALL BEEN FISHERIES. THE SAME AND SO SOMEONE IS OLDER COULD SAY WELL I'M NOT CHILD BUT CONSIDERING CURRENT MY POINT IS WE DID THAT AND MEDICARE WE PROVIDE RIGHT. RIGHT EXACTLY YEAH EXACTLY SO THAT'S MEDI CAL BUT WE'RE NOW TALKING ABOUT -- DOWN THE PRIVATE INSURANCE THERE IS A DIFFERENT. THERE'S A PUT THERE YES THERE IS A POSSIBILITY THERE'S A PAUSE IT'S NOT A CERTAINTY THE POSSIBILITY AND SO THE CONCERN IS IS THAT WE HAD SOME SEVERAL DISCUSSIONS I APPRECIATE WORKING WITH THE AUTHORS OFFICE. IS IS THAT -- TO STILL SAY THAT OUR GOAL IS CHILDREN BUT RECOGNIZING THERE IS A POSSIBILITY NAY RECOGNIZE THE OPPOSITION HAS CONCERNS BECAUSE IF IT'S RULE DISCRIMINATORY BY THE WITH. IT BY THE REGULATORS AT IT THEN ESSENTIALLY IT WOULD AUTOMATICALLY THEN EXTEND TO EVERYONE AND THAT WOULD GREATLY INCREASE THE COST SO LITTLE AND THEN WE'D HAVE TO COME BACK HERE AND FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO ABOUT THAT SO -- SO THAT THERE IS A RISK OF THAT I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS WE WORKED ON IS ACTUALLY PUTTING STRONGER INTENT LANGUAGE TO MAKE CLEAR IT'S NOT CERTAIN THAT THEY WILL REGULATE THEY WILL RULE THAT WAY EITHER WITH OUR SEVERAL STATES THAT HAVE CHILDREN ONLY. SO IT'S NOT A CERTAINTY BUT IT'S A POSSIBILITY GOT IT THANK YOU FOR THAT OKAY FAKING. AND MY SECOND FINAL QUESTION HERE AT ONE ONE COMMENT ON THAT ISSUE -- IF YOU PLEASE SENATOR THE FEDERAL DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES IS ALREADY ISSUED A RULE THAT CLARIFIES THAT STATE AND FEDERAL MANDATES WITH H. DISTINCTIONS. DO NOT CONSTITUTE AGE DISCRIMINATION. AND TO A I CAN I CAN QUOTE FROM -- FROM THAT FINAL RULE -- BUT IT'S IT IT SIR IT'S QUITE CLEAR WELL I THINK THE THING AND ADDED WITHOUT GOING TO ATTRACT APPRECIATE YOU BRING THAT UP. I THINK THE WAY THE RULES OF THE LOSS SAID IS ACTUALLY A DISCUSSION OF OUR STATE REGULATORS TODAY IT'S THEIR THEIR TO WANT TO MAKE THE CALL ON THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE OR OTHER SIMILAR ISSUES AND THAT'S THE CHALLENGE. THANK YOU MY FINAL QUESTION IS -- SOMEONE MENTION COCHLEAR IMPLANTS IS IT JUST HEARING AIDS THAT AREN'T COVERED. OUR OTHER A HEARING -- KIND OF REMEDIATION CYCLE CLEAR IMPACTS COVER IN THIS JUST HEARING AIDS ARE NOT THE IRONY HERE IS THAT COCHLEAR IMPLANTS ARE. INCLUDED AS I CENTRAL HEALTH BENEFIT -- I SHOULD POINT OUT THAT -- FOR MANY CHILDREN I THINK -- DOCTOR CHECK AND PROBABLY BETTER SPEAK TO THIS BUT MANY CHILDREN WHO RECEIVE COCHLEAR IMPLANTS START OUT WITH HEARING AIDS AND THAT'S ACTUALLY ESSENTIAL TO THEIR DEVELOPMENT. THANK YOU. OF THE SUPPORT THAT I WOULD LIKE TO MOVE THE BILL AT THE PERFECT TIME OKAY ASSN LEYVA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR ASSEMBLYMEMBER BLOOM I WANNA THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD I I THINK THAT WE CAN ALWAYS FIND A WAY NOT TO DO SOMETHING. BUT I THINK IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT WE DO FIND A WAY TO DO SOMETHING AND HEARING AIDS -- ARE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT ESPECIALLY FOR YOUNG CHILDREN WHEN I WAS GRADUATING FROM COLLEGE A VERY LONG TIME AGO -- AND MY DEGREE IS IN A COMMUNICATIVE DISORDERS I WAS GOING TO BE A SPEECH THERAPIST AND I WAS TAKING A CLASS AN AUDIOLOGY I WAS ALSO SIX MONTHS PREGNANT WITH OUR TWINS. AND I REMEMBER THINKING THAT. WHEN MY GIRLS ARE BORN BUT IN OTHER GIRLS AT THE TIME WHEN MY CHILDREN ARE BORN? IF THEY NEED A HEARING AID I NEED TO KNOW IMMEDIATELY BECAUSE CHILDREN FALL BEHIND SO QUICKLY IF THEY CAN'T HEAR AND AND AND LEARN SOUNDS AND WORDS. SO. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE ARE PROVIDING IT FOR CHILDREN UNDER EIGHT ARE UNDER. EIGHTEEN BUT I ALSO WANT TO PUT A PLUG IN FOR ADULTS BECAUSE AS SOMEONE WHO REPRESENTED WORKERS FOR MANY YEARS. I HAD A MY CREW GUY -- OF THIRTY FIVE YEARS IT WAS ABOUT TO LOSE HIS JOB. AND I ASKED HIM I SAID YOU KNOW YOU'RE SO ANGRY ALL THE TIME WHAT IS THE PROBLEM HE COULDN'T HEAR SO MANAGEMENT THOUGHT THAT HE WAS IGNORING THEM HE COULDN'T HEAR THE INSTRUCTIONS. AND IT'S SHOCKING TO ME THAT YOU WERE HERE IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN AND WE'RE STILL ARGUING OVER WHO'S GOING TO PAY FOR HEARING AIDS TO MAKE SURE OUR CHILDREN CAN LEARN. TO MAKE SURE ADULTS CAN DO THEIR JOB AND BE EFFECTIVE MEMBERS OF SOCIETY SO I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IS FIND A WAY TO DO WHAT'S RIGHT AND THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS PER HEARING AID. SIX THOUSAND FOR ONE CHILD AND THEY'RE GONNA OUTGROW THOSE THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH MONEY YOU HAVE TO MAKE TO BE ABLE TO AFFORD THAT. SO WE NEED TO GET TO A POINT WHERE INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE PAYING FOR IT I KNOW YOU HATE TO HEAR THAT BUT WHAT WE DO DO WE JUST ALLOW THESE YOUNG CHILDREN. TO NOT BUILD HERE AND DEVELOP AND REACH THEIR FULL POTENTIAL -- WE HAVE TO FIND A WAY WE CAN FIND A WAY TO SAY NO LET'S FIND A WAY TO SAY YES I AM LOOK FOR SUPPORTING THE BILL. HEY SIR GROWTH. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I DO APPRECIATE THE BILL AND I APPRECIATE ALL THE COMMENTS ON IT AND I DO AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUES THAT WE DO NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT SOMETHING GETS DONE FOR CHILDREN -- AND ADULTS BUT TODAY WE'RE DISCUSSING CHILDREN BUT I DO HAVE SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT THE PROCESS AND I'M SORRY THAT I DON'T HAVE THE ANSWER SO BE LOOKING TO ALL OF YOU TO GIVE THEM. SO IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA THERE THE A BOMB ADMINISTRATION WITH THE ACA -- WAS HEARING AIDS OR HEARING PROTECT HEARING. AIDS WERE THEY COVERED UNDER THE GENERAL A CA. IS THAT WHY WE DIDN'T COVER HIM OR ARE THERE PLANS THAT ARE AVAILABLE UNDER THE ACA THAT WE IS CALIFORNIANS ADOPT. SO THE PROCESS WHY IS THAT EACH STATE WAS SORT OF GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO PICK A BENCHMARK% PLAN AND WE WERE GIVEN A MULTITUDE OF OPTIONS ONE BEING I THINK THAT. MOST COMMON SMALL GROUP PLANNED THE CALPERS PLAN THE FEDERAL PLAN. I'M I BELIEVE IT WAS TWENTY TWELVE WHEN WE ELECTED OUR FIRST BENCHMARK PLAN. PART OF THAT WAS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WAS LOOKING TO STATES -- TO PICK WHAT WAS MOST UTILIZED IN THEIR OWN STATE WHICH MADE THE MOST SENSE THAT THEY SET UP THE CRITERIA OF THE OF THE TEN ESSENTIAL HEALTH BENEFITS WHAT HAD TO BE INCLUDED. AND THEN YOU CHOSE FROM THE PLAN OPTIONS THAT YOU HAD AVAILABLE TO YOU AND SO THERE WAS A STAKEHOLDER PROCESS THEIR CONVERSATIONS THEIR LEGISLATIVE -- BILLS THAT WERE RUN I KNOW THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER HAD SEVERAL HEARINGS ABOUT WHAT PLAN MADE THE MOST SENSE FOR CALIFORNIA OBVIOUSLY WE WERE VERY PRICE SENSITIVE AT THE TIME KNOWING THAT THIS WOULD BE BASICALLY THE STANDARD FOR WHICH PEOPLE WOULD PURCHASE. AT THAT TIME THE KAISER THIRTY PLUS PLAN THAT WAS CHOSEN -- DIDN'T INCLUDE HEARING IT'S AN ACTUAL EXCLUDED COVERAGE FOR HEARING AIDS -- AND TWENTY FIFTEEN WE THEN WENT THROUGH THE PROCESS AGAIN TO CONSIDER AN UPDATE THAT BENCHMARK PLANNED THE KAISER THIRTY PLAN WAS AGAIN CHOSEN -- WITH REMAINING THAT SORT OF EXCLUSIONS SO I THINK FROM OUR OUR PLACE. AS FAR AS THE PROCESS BE UNDERSTANDING THAT ONCE WE EXCEED THE BENCHMARK PLAN WE'VE SORT OF OPENED THE DOOR TO THOSE CONVERSATIONS THE STATE THE PHRASE THE COST -- FOR ANY SERVICE THAT GOES BEYOND WHAT THE BENCHMARK PLAN IS. SO WE JUST SORT OF GENERALLY SUGGESTED THAT IF THE STATE IS INTERESTED I MEAN CHIROPRACTIC THERE ARE OTHER THINGS TO IT AND AND WE'VE SEEN MULTITUDE OF MANDATES THAT COME BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE. THAT THAT'S A BETTER PROCESS TO CONSIDER TO HAVE A STAKEHOLDER PROCESS TO LOOK AT THE OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO CHOOSE AND POTENTIALLY CHOOSE A PLAN THAT INCLUDES COVERAGE FOR HEARING AIDS ONE SO THAT YOU PROTECT YOU DON'T EXCEED THE BENCHMARK PLAN. YOU DON'T ASSUME THE FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR ALL THOSE DIFFERENT COSTS OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WON'T COVER. I ALSO GIVE THE STATE LEGISLATORS THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONSIDER WHAT THEY THINK IS THE BEST OPPORTUNITY FOR STE CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU SO I THINK MY QUESTION IS BE ACID EFFORT HUESO AYE I GUESS MY QUESTION IS IS THAT I DON'T TO DUPLICATE ANYTHING SO WE'RE ALL SURE THAT THE IN THE ACA DID NOT COVER. A HEARING FOR THE THEY LEFT IT UP TO STATES WHICH WHICH IS KIND OF SILLY TO ME I THINK BECAUSE I SHOW I'M SURE CALIFORNIA IS NOT THE ONLY STATE THAT HAS HEARING IMPAIRED CHILDREN -- I'M SURE THAT GOES OVER ALL FIFTY STATES -- I WOULD THINK. SO I WOULD THINK THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WOULD COVER THAT BUT I AND I'M NOT TRYING TO BASH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT I'M JUST TRYING TO SAY THAT. SO I GUESS MY NEXT QUESTION IS IS THAT IF IT IS NOT COVERED ON THE FEDERAL SIDE AND IT IS LEFT UP TO THE STATE'S THEN MOVED TO THE BENCHMARK PLAN. IF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WITH LEGISLATORS ADOPT A BENCHMARK PLAN. THAT IS COVERED -- BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BUT THEN ADD. TEN TWELVE TO SIX ITEMS TO THAT PLAN THAT COULD OR COULD NOT HAVE A SIGNIFICANT COST. WHERE IS THAT FUNDING MECHANISM COMING FROM [inaudible] SIR. WELL -- TO THE AT THE ANSWER IS ACTUALLY THE STATE. SO IT DOES BECOME A COST TO THE STATE TO PROVIDE THAT COVERAGE BEYOND THE BENCHMARK PLAN SO WE GET TO DECIDE. WITHIN CERTAIN PARAMETERS WHAT THE BENCHMARK PLAN IS AND IF WE HAD ANYTHING BEYOND THAT -- THEN THE STATE IS. FOR FOR AT LEAST THE PUBLIC PIECES OF IT RIGHT SO -- THIS UP IT IS ON THE STATE AND THEN OF COURSE FOR OTHER PRIME INSURERS IT WOULD GET PASSED ON TO CONSUMERS RIGHT AS PART OF AND TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM LOS ANGELES POINT SO WE DON'T MISS THINGS LIKE THIS AGAIN. IS THERE SOME WAY THAT WE STUDY OR THAT WE HAVE -- YOU KNOW THIS IS THE BENCHMARK PLAN WE CHOSE BUT THESE ARE THE TEN ITEMS WE ADDED TO IT WHICH GIVES US THE TRUE COST OF WHAT THE ENTIRE. HEALTH CARE COST IS RIGHT BECAUSE WE CAN'T JUST GO BACK TO THE BENCHMARK PLAN AND SAY THIS WE PAID X.. BECAUSE WE OBVIOUSLY DIDN'T PAY X. IF WE ADDED TEN MORE ITEMS TO IT. IS THERE SOME TYPE OF SOMETHING SO WE CAN GET A TRUE COSTS FOR THE HEALTH CARE. OR NOT [inaudible] SORRY. YEAH I'M TIED TO A DEMO SURE YOU GET YOUR QUESTIONS ANSWERED SO -- DESCRIBE IT THIS BILL IS THE WOOD WE HAVE NOT GONE BEYOND THE BENCHMARK PLAN YET SO THIS THIS IS THE FIRST THIS WOULD BE THE FIRST OF IT. SOMEBODY SAID TEN NO WE DO NOT WE HAVE NOT AND I THINK STEP PERHAPS IN ASTOPS YOU CAN SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES -- A UNDERSTAND THAT THAT'S ONE OF THE CONCERNS IS THAT THIS IS THE FIRST TIME WE'RE BREAKING BEYOND THE BENCHMARK PLAN THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR SO I GUESS MY NEXT QUESTION IS FROM THE STATE PERSPECTIVE I REALIZE THAT WE WOULD PICK OF OF COSTS FOR PUBLIC ISSUES. ON THE PRIVATE PAY ISSUE -- DO HEALTH PLANS IN ASSESSING TO HEALTH PLANS WHEN THEY PUT THEIR POLICY OUT THERE FOR A YEAR YOU OBVIOUSLY SUBMIT YOUR RATES TO THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE. IS WATER PLAN COVERS THE COST OF THIS PLAN. SO YOU SELL PLAN X. THAT COVERS THESE ESSENTIAL SERVICES REQUIRED BY THE ACA WHAT WE ADOPTING CALIFORNIA. CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG. OKAY THAT THAT COST OR THAT FREE WORK THAT IS APPROVED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE GOES FOR WHAT PERIOD OF TIME. ONE YEAR OKAY SO IF THIS GETS IMPLEMENTED AND YOUR NEW PROGRAM DOESN'T GET SUBMITTED WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE. UNTIL THE FOLLOWING YEAR THE WERE YOU SUBMIT YOUR PLAN. AND YOU CAN'T COVER WHAT IS NOW GOING TO BE MANDATED FREE TO COVER. AND I WE YOU NEED COVERAGE OKAY I'M SORRY I THINK YOU NEED COVERAGE SO -- BUT IF IF WHERE'S THIS GAP WHERE DOES THE RESOURCES COME FOR THIS GAP WHERE YOU WILL. YOU HAVE NOT. YOU HAVE NOT SUBMITTED TO THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE TO COVER THIS PARTICULAR PRODUCT. THIS PARTICULAR ITEM. AND NOW YOU ARE GOING TO BE REQUIRED TO COVER IT WHERE DOES. THE RECENT WHERE DOES IT COME FROM THE FUNDING MECHANISM AND CAN YOU CHANGE YOUR PLAN PLAN FOR THE CAN CHANGE PLAN. FOR THEIR PART OF INSURANCE MIDSTREAM SO CAPS NUMBERS FILE WITH THAT COVER CALIFORNIA HANDED HER MINUTES OF MANAGED HEALTH CARE THAT REGULATE. THE HMO THOSE AND THEY'RE ACTIVELY FILING THEIR PRODUCTS AND THEIR RATES FOR TWENTY TWENTY OKAY RIGHT NOW. AND SO THE FISCAL YEAR IT'S A VISITS AT A SCHOOL RIGHT NOW TO COUNTY CALENDAR YEAR OKAY THE END OF DECEMBER SO THOSE FILINGS ARE OCCURRING NOW. FOR THE BENEFITS THAT ARE CURRENTLY PART OF THEIR PLAN DESIGN. WHICH WE MANDATE AS A STATE LEGISLATOR RIGHT SO THE ESSENTIAL HEALTH BENEFITS IN OUTLINES WHAT WHAT THEY NEED TO COVER AND SO THE PLAN SUBMIT THEIR THEIR PRODUCT IN THEIR RATES WITH THAT AND THEN THE REGULATOR GHOSTS OF THEIR PROCESS AND THEN THOSE PLANS. TYPICALLY YOU KNOW THROUGH THE PRIVATE MARKET START ON JANUARY. FIRST. AND RUN THROUGH THAT YEAR AND SO THE PREMIUMS THAT ARE -- DEVELOPED BY THE PLAN ACTUARIES ARE BASED ON THE PLANS EXPERIENCE AND THE BENEFIT PACKAGE. THAT IS GOING TO BE PROVIDED TO THE ENROLLEES. SO IT IS THE RATES ARE SET TO COVER THE COST OF CARE. AND THE OPERATIONAL COST ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS FOR THE PLAN TO OPERATE AND RUN TO ANSWER PHONES AND SEND THEIR STUFF OUT AND DO ALL THE THINGS THAT THAT MY MEMBERS DO SO WELL. SO THAT'S WHAT'S INCLUDED IN THE PREMIUM AND SO WHEN WE LOOK AT BENEFIT MANDATES WE DO CONSIDER THE COST TO THE PREMIUM THAT EVERYBODY PAYS BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT [inaudible] OUR SO YOU KNOW WHEN THE STATE YOU KNOW MANDATES THAT WE HEARD A NEW BENEFIT THEN WE HAVE TO BUILD IT INTO THAT PLAN AND THE COSTS ARE AT YOU'VE ALREADY SUBMITTED YOUR PARTIES FOR NEXT YEAR WE HAVE HEARD SOMEONE ELSE LICENSE MELENDEZ THIS. BILL TAKE EFFECT SIR. IF IT GETS SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR WOMEN IN ONE OF THE AMENDMENTS HAS THAT -- A I THINK IT'S JULY OF FOR YEAH TWENTY TWENTY FIRST MAY TWENTY IT WAS GOING TO BE JANUARY ONE BUT SO JULY OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO DECEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY WHO FUNDS THE SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS PER KID ROUGHLY. WHO DOES THAT? I DON'T KNOW THE WOULD. UNDER THE PLANS. BUT WHERE DO YOU COME UP WITH THAT MANY I GUESS IS WHAT I'M SAYING BECAUSE YOU FILED YOUR WHAT I'M TRYING TO GET ACROSS TO JUST VERIFY THAT THE THE WAY THE AMENDMENTS ARE FRAMES. IS JUST THAT IT'S AT RENEWAL SO THE SO THE MOROCCAN SO I AND I UNDERSTAND YOUR QUESTIONS CONCERNS LIKE IS IT DID WHAT IT IS. THAT'S PART IN MINUTES YES OKAY SO PART OF THE MINUTES IS PROTECTING THE PLANS OF FILED FOR THAT. PART OF THAT. RIGHT SO THE SO WHAT I'M WORRIED ABOUT IS I THINK IT SHOULD BE COVERED I THINK THE PLAN SHOULD COVER THIS I THINK WE SHOULD HAVE MADE SURE. AND THE ESSENTIAL SERVICES THAT -- CENTRAL BENEFITS THAT IT WAS COVERED I GET I GET THAT BUT SINCE WE COLLECTIVELY LET THAT GO. AND NOW I'M CONCERNED ABOUT MANDATING THIS AND THERE BE NO RESOURCES TO PAY FOR IT. AND HAVING PLANS CONTINUE TO LEAVE AND NOT HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE PLANS A COVERAGE FOR YOU KNOW. PEOPLE IN COVERAGE AND IF YOU DON'T HAVE PLANS TO PROVIDE COVERAGE IT PUTS US IN A BAD SPOT AND WE MANDATE THINGS ON PLANS. AND THAT ARE OUTSIDE OF THEIR CONTROL YOU CAN CONTROL THIS CASE VERY SIMILAR TO RATES APARTMENT INSURANCE. MY CONCERN IS WHERE THAT MONEY COMES FROM BUT THIS WILL NOT TAKE EFFECT UNTIL PLANS GET TO SUBMIT THEIR NEW RATES TO THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE. CORRECT UNDER THE MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT -- AT RENEWAL POLICY RATES WILL BE ADJUSTED -- THE ESTIMATE THAT WE HAVE FOR WHAT THE COST OF THAT WILL BE TO CONSUMERS ARE -- TO PLAN MEMBERS IS THE THE RANGE WOULD BE FROM SIX CENTS PER MEMBER PER MONTH IN THE INDIVIDUAL MARKET. TO TWELVE CENTS PER MEMBER PER MONTH AND SMALL GROUP PLANS. YOU PRICE OUT PLANS IS THAT ACCURATE I'M QUESTIONING YOU I'M JUST ASKING FOR SOMEBODY TO GIVE ME SOME TYPE OF ACCURACY -- I THINK I MEAN THAT'S BASED ON THE SUBURBAN DALLAS SAYS I MEAN THAT'S THAT'S WHAT YOU PURPOSE SORT OF TASKED WITH THIS COMING OKAY A GENERAL -- ANALYSIS I THINK OUR ISSUE OR CONCERN AND WE BROUGHT THIS UP EARLIER IS. TO THE DEGREE IF THERE IS IF THE REGULATORS A TERMINUS TO BE DISCRIMINATORY AND THEREFORE HAS TO BE APPLIED TO BOTH CHILDREN AND ADULTS THE IMPACT COULD BE GREATER AND NOT SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BURKE DIDN'T ANALYZE FOR THE ONLY ANALYZE FOR THE BILL AND PRINT. IT IN THE CHAIR MENTIONED WHAT DO YOU THINK THE CHANCES ARE REGULATORS WILL GO AGAINST THAT IN INCLUDING DILTS BECAUSE IT'S DISCRIMINATORY EVEN THOUGH. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS DETERMINED THAT WELL SO JUST TO BE CLEAR -- IT SAID THERE'S A POSSIBILITY IT'S IT'S HARD TO YES THERE ARE STATES THAT ACTUALLY HAVE COVERAGE IT'S ONLY KIDS SO IT'S NOT CERTAIN THAT THEY'LL BE DECLARED DISCRIMINATORY. BUT THERE IS A POSSIBILITY AND WE NEED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT AND THEY DO SO THAT'S EITHER TEAMMATES SEE THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE OR DEPARTMENT SHARON'S. DECLARES A DISCRIMINATORY. THEN -- THEN. BASICALLY BE ON THE HOOK. FOR BOTH CHILDREN AND ADULTS AUTOMATICALLY SO. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT -- SO THAT'S IT THAT'S STATE STATE REGULATORS THAT AND THAT'S WHY ST SO I APPRECIATE -- SUMMER BLOOM BRING UP. THE STATEMENT FROM HIS OFFICE OF CIVIL RIGHTS AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BUT ACTUALLY IT'S TRIGGERED BY THE STATE REGULATORS IN SEVERAL STATES BY THE WAY THE REGULATORS HAVE NOT. DECLARED DISCRIMINATORY SO THEY ACTUALLY HAVE COVERAGE JUST FOR KIDS SO IT'S CERTAINLY KNOWS THERE'S NO CERTAINTY THAT. THE REGULATORS WILL DECLARE IT -- DISCRIMINATORY A IN FACT THEM I THINK WITH THE LAW THE TELLING WHICH THAT THE AUTHORS PUT IN THAT WE'VE ALSO TALKED ABOUT. OUR HOPE IS THEY WOULD NOT -- BUT I IT BUT TO BE FULLY TRANSPARENT AS ALWAYS THERE IS A POSSIBILITY. BUT WE HAVE GONE TO GREAT LENGTHS TO GUARD RAILS AROUND THIS I THINK DOCTOR CHAN -- HAD A COMMENT IF YOU SIR YES. JUST A BRIEF COMMENT ABOUT THE AGE DISCRIMINATION -- ISSUE FROM THE MEDICAL AN IDEOLOGICAL STANDPOINT HEARING LOSS IN CHILDREN IS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT CONDITIONS AND HEARING LOSS IN ADULTS IN TERMS OF BOTH THE IN TERMS ABOUT THE CAUSES AND CONSEQUENCES -- THE PRIMARY CONCERN FOR HEARING LOSS IN CHILDREN IS HOW IT AFFECTS UP PERMANENT -- THAT DEVELOPMENT SO SPEECH AND LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENTS AND COGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT WHICH ARE FUNDAMENTAL TO OUR HEALTH -- THAT'S NOT TO SAY THAT THERE ARE NOT HEALTH IMPLICATIONS FOR HEARING LOSS IN ADULTS -- BUT THERE ARE NUMEROUS EXAMPLES BOTH IN A STANDARD CLINICAL PRACTICE AND IN -- IN -- IN REGULATORY -- EXAMPLES WHERE CHILDREN AND ADULTS ARE TREATED VERY DIFFERENTLY AND RULES ARE VERY DIFFERENCE -- WITH RESPECT TO HEARING LOSS SO I HAVE YOU KNOW QUITE A BIT OF CONFIDENCE BASED ON WHAT'S HAPPENED OTHER STATES AS WELL AS THE MEDICAL REALITY IS THAT -- AGE DISCRIMINATION -- SHOULD HOPEFULLY SHOULD NOT BE AN ISSUE HERE. AND I MY LAST QUESTION I GUESS IS THAT IF IT IS A ISSUE IF IT DID DOES HE HAVE AN ISSUE AND YOU TAKE THAT TWELVE CENTS MULTIPLY IT BY HOW MANY ADULTS. WITH THE ADDITIONAL INCREASE ESTIMATED COST. BUT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO COVER BEFORE YOUR NEW RATES ARE REAPPLIED IN RENEWED. I THINK THAT'S THE UNKNOWN I DON'T WE DON'T WE DON'T HAVE AN EXACT NUMBER AND TO PURPOSE GIVEN THE FACT THAT THEIR ONLY PATH TO LOOK AT THE BILL AND PRINT THAT ISN'T SOMETHING THAT THEY WERE ANALYZED OR PROVIDING. OKAY THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER. THERE STONE WE GIVE US A JUST A FOLLOW UP AGAIN WITH THE PLANS -- THE WAY I THINK I SEE IT IS THAT IF WE WERE TO ENTERTAIN THE BILL. THAT WOULD BE A SIX MONTH PERIOD OF TIME THAT YOU BASICALLY WOULD BE RECEIVING A PREMIUM FOR THIS -- THIS ADDITIONAL SERVICES THAT CORRECT -- I'M MISSING SOMETHING SO YOU WOULD BE COVERED IF. AIDS THEY DID IT. WE OFTEN ASK FOR DELAYED IMPLEMENTATION OFFICE OF THE DENNIS TAKE CARE OF THAT PROCESS OKAY SO -- I'M A I'M A BABY BOOMER. AND AND I LIKE GROUPS LIKE -- STUFF AND WILL. FOR AND YES AND AND I USED TO BLAST THE MUSIC I CRAZY AND MY PARENTS WERE ALWAYS WERE WARNING ME YOU'RE GOING TO LOSE YOUR HERE. HERE SOUND AND A NEW TURN THE MUSIC DOWN WHICH OF COURSE DIDN'T. LISTEN TO THEM. AND THEN I FOUND -- WATCHING TV AT NIGHT WITH MY LOVELY WIFE -- SHOULD BE -- ABBY'S TELLING HER TURN THE VOLUME UP I CAN'T HEAR AND SHE GOES WELL THE NEIGHBORS ALREADY COMPLAINING THAT THEY CAN HEAR NEXT DOOR SO. MY HEARING WAS WAS GOING AND SO -- NEVER. HAVING THIS ISSUE BEFORE. YOU FOLLOW YOUR TELEVISION ADVERTISEMENTS IN A SALE COME HERE FOR THIS PARTICULAR YEAR. DEVICE AND GO IN THERE AND I GOT A I GOT A QUOTE OF LIKE EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS AND I ABOUT. THE IN ANY PARTY CHECKER INSURANCE A SOMEWHAT HOW MUCH IS INSURANCE GOING TO COVER IT WAS LIKE A THOUSAND BUCKS. AND SO LIKE SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS OUT OF POCKET -- AND I AND I PERSONALLY BELIEVE THAT WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH THE CENSUS YOU'RE DEALING WITH SITE YOU'RE DEALING WITH HEARING ESPECIALLY FOR A CHILD OR AN ADULT THESE ARE THESE ARE ESSENTIAL. TOOLS THAT YOU NEED -- TO FUNCTION I EVEN IN THE PUBLIC SAFETY ARENA I WOULD USE THE ARGUMENT THAT YOU HAVE TO BILL HEAR SIRENS IF YOU'RE DRIVING A CAR THERE'S A AN INCIDENT GOING ON BUT THE POINT I WANT TO MAKE IS THAT. TECHNOLOGY IS CHANGING. AND I WAS ABLE TO GO TO A A RETAILER AND I WAS ABLE TO GET WHAT I CONSIDER TO BE QUALITY -- HEARING AIDS FOR ABOUT SIXTEEN HUNDRED BUCKS. AND RECENTLY WE'VE SEEN ON SOME CABLE CHANNELS OF ANOTHER ONE THAT'S ON THE MARKET THAT YOU CAN PROGRAM WITH YOUR IPAD IN. THE RE CHARGEABLE FOR SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS SO I WOULD SAY THE TRENDS ARE THAT. IF YOU PUT A A MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE COSTS AT THE INSURANCE COMPANY MAY OR MAY NOT COVER THAT IT WILL HELP THE PRIVATE SECTOR GO OUT AND SHOP AROUND AND FIND SOME OF THESE. GOOD QUALITY HEARING AIDS THAT ARE OUT THERE THAT MIGHT BE. MUCH LESS EXPENSIVE -- BUT BUT I AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM FROM LOS ANGELES. AT THE TIME SHAME ON US FOR NOT PICKING THE THE THE THE PLAN THAT COVERS THE BASIC ESSENTIALS TO TO HUMAN HEALTH. WHICH I THINK THIS IS ONE OF THEM -- IT SOUNDS LIKE TO ME BE SOMEONE I'M HEARING THAT THE PREMIUMS ARE NOT GOING TO BE EXTRAVAGANTLY LARGER FOR THIS ADDITIONAL SERVICE ESPECIALLY WITH LIMITED TO PETE'S -- BUT I'M SURE THAT THE PLANS WILL WILL INCORPORATE HOPEFULLY THESE COST A CERTAIN THE BILL MOVES OUT TODAY MY PLAN SUPPORTING IT -- THAT WILL GIVE AN INCENTIVE FOR THOSE IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR TO SHOP AROUND BECAUSE THERE IS A TREMENDOUS DELTA AND WHAT THESE HEARING AIDS CAN COST. AND I'M NOT SURE THAT YOU'RE SACRIFICING MUCH QUALITY BY GETTING AN EXPENSIVE HEARING AID -- IN COMPARISON TO WHAT I WOULD CONSIDER THIS THE CADILLAC BRANDS. SO -- I'M HAPPY TO TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY SENATOR THE SOME OF THE BLOOM -- I THINK IT'S IT'S TIME -- AND I'M SURE THAT THE THE PLANTS WILL DO THEIR BEST TO KEEP THE PREMIUMS -- AND AFFORDABLE LEVEL BUT WE HAVE TO PROVIDE -- HEARING DEVICES FOR THE HEARING IMPAIRED THANK YOU [inaudible] SIR RUBIO. THANK YOU AM I JUST WANT TO SPEAK ON THIS ISSUE IN PARTICULAR BECAUSE YOU KNOW I SHARED WITH THE AUTHOR OF MY EXPERIENCE AS AN EDUCATOR AND HOW DETRIMENTAL IT IS FOR OUR STUDENTS. DURING THE EARLY YEARS OF THEIR EDUCATION NOT TO BE ABLE TO HEAR AND I HAD MANY MANY CASES IN WHICH YOU KNOW WE TRIED EVERYTHING AND WE THOUGHT THERE ARE SPECIAL NEEDS AND JUST REALIZING THAT JUST NEEDED A SIMPLE HEARING AID MADE ALL THE DIFFERENCE IN THE WORLD SO. I'M OWSLEY SUPPORTIVE OF GETTING THOSE KIDS AND OLDER YOUNGER ADULTS -- WHAT THEY NEED TO SELL THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FOR I THINK IT'S ESSENTIAL WITHOUT? THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU IN THE BILL'S BEEN MOVED -- SO SUMMER BLOOM FIRST VOIGTS -- THAT THANK YOU FOR WORKING WITH MY STAFF -- ON ON ON THIS BILL AND IT'S SO. YES FIRST OF ALL AS ACM VERY SENSITIVE WHAT TO WHAT THE OPPOSITION HAS -- BROUGHT UP -- THIS IS IS THIS WOULD BE THE FIRST BILL THAT WOULD -- IF IT BECAME LAW WITH THE EXCEED THE ESSENTIAL THAT THAT SOMEONE RECOGNIZE WHAT CENTER MITCHELL SAID. ABOUT YOU KNOW WE SHOULD. TAKE A LOOK AT THAT NOT JUST TO BE CLEAR -- NO WE PICK A DIFFERENT PLAN FOR BENCHMARK PLANNED THAT WILL ALSO HAVE THE FACTS ON THE OVERALL PREMIUM RATES ACROSS THE BOARD RIGHT IT BECOMES AND THE I'M SURE THE JURORS WOULD SAY. SIR NOT A YES RIGHT BECAUSE IF WE PROVIDE A RICHER BENEFIT PACKAGE IN IN THAT NEGOTIATION OF THAT WAS ATTENTION RIGHT. RIGHT YES I AM ITS RIGHT EXACTLY SO WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT THAT WAS PART OF THE TENSION WE TRIED TO DECIDE THE BENCHMARK PLAN AND I THINK MANY OF US WANTED SOMETHING A LITTLE. BROADER -- THEN WE LANDED ON BECAUSE THERE'S ATTENTION THE BROADER IT IS THE HIGHER THE PREMIUMS WILL BE. AND SO WHEN THAT YOU KNOW AFTER ALL THE PEOPLE PURCHASE YOUR PAIN THOSE PREMIUMS AND AND SO THAT IT THAT WAS THE BACK AND FORTH AND SO I THINK THAT -- BUT I THINK WE SHOULD THE NEXT THEN WE SHOULD BE EXPLORED THAT AND AND AND SEE EXACTLY WHAT TENSION IS BECAUSE WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT SOMETHING LIKE HEARING LOSS PARTICULARLY. IN KIDS I MEAN THAT DOES BEG THE QUESTIONS LIKE WHAT THAT SOMETHING YOU REALLY SHOULD BE COVERING AND WHY ARE WE NOT DOING IT SO SO CERTAINLY WE NEED TO PUT THAT. TABLE I WOULD I WOULD POINT OUT THAT IT WAS MENTIONED AND AGAIN I WANT TO THANK -- THE SEMINAR FOR WORKING -- WITH THE COMMITTEE STAFF YEAH WE DO PERMITS THE PLANS TO AND GET TO TO DO SO SOME COST SHARING SO -- TO IT SO THAT THERE IS -- SO THAT THE PEOPLE BE PRUDENT PURCHASERS AND JUST NOT TRYING TO YOU KNOW RUN UP THE LIMITS -- THAT THERE THAT THAT -- SO FORTH -- AND I THINK AGAIN IT'S THOSE ARE IMPORTANT -- COST MEASURES THAT HOPEFULLY PROVIDE PEOPLE CHOICE AND ALLOW THEM TO GET A QUALITY PRODUCT -- BUT AT THE SAME TIME. RECOGNIZING WE HAVE TO BE PRUDENT PURCHASERS WEIRD THE POLICY COMMITTEE SO I THINK PROCREATION WE'LL HAVE SOME CONVERSATIONS ABOUT COST BECAUSE WE ARE ON THE HOOK. FOR EVERYONE IN THE INDIVIDUAL MARKET FOR THE INCREASED COST AND IN ONE SMALL GROUP MARKET SO THAT'S GOING TO BE SOMETHING THAT PROCREATION IS WILL DEAL WITH. BUT I WOULD SAY ALSO FUNDAMENTALLY -- AS A DEVELOPMENTAL PEDIATRICIAN THE FIRST QUESTION. THEY ASK WHEN WE HAVE A CHILD WHO IS A DEVELOPMENTAL DELAYS CAM DAY HERE AND CAN THEY SEE. AND IF THE ANSWER IS NO. AND WE DON'T FIX THAT PROBLEM AND THEY CAN'T HEAR OR THEY CAN'T SEE RIGHT IF TROUBLE WITH THAT. WE CAN'T GO BEYOND THAT RIGHT WE IT'S IT'S LIKE -- FIND THE QUEUE WE KNOW THEY HAVE HEARING LOSS AND MAYBE THEY HAVE SOME OTHER THINGS GOING ON BEYOND THAT AND THAT'S WHY THERE'S DELAYED SPEECH OR WHATEVER ELSE. BUT WITHOUT FIXING THE HEARING YOU JUST CAN'T GO YOU KEEP THERE'S NOT MUCH MORE. YOU CAN DO THAT'S GOING TO BE EFFECTIVE FUNNELED THE HEARING AND AND SO THAT COST GOES BEYOND MEDICAL COSTS I MEAN. AND AND THERE'S CRITICAL PEERS THE DEVELOPMENT I KNOW THAT -- THE GOOD THAT I DON'T KNOW LIKE I JUST KNOW THIS IS THAT ONCE A CRITICAL PERIOD DEVELOPMENT IF WE DON'T FIX THAT PROBLEM WITHIN A WINDOW OF TIME IT'S NOT LIKE WE CAN GO BACK IN TIME AND FIX IT LATER. THAT PROBLEM BECOMES MORE PERMANENT BECAUSE IT ACTUALLY SHIPS THE WAY THE BRAIN DEVELOPS. SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WE FIND THE PROBLEM WE SCREEN FOR THE PROBLEM WE THAT'S WHAT WE SCREEN FOR A NEW BUNCH WHEN WE FIND PROBLEMS SCREEN FRONT OF WE DON'T ADDRESS IT. IN A CERTAIN WINDOW OF TIME. THAT'S A CONSEQUENCE THAT PERMANENT FOR THAT CHILD IS THE BECOME AN ADULT THAT. BECOMES A PERMANENT ISSUE IN TERMS OF THEIR FUTURE LEARNING THE PENDULUM NOW OF COURSE BECOMES A PERMANENT ISSUE BY THE WAY FOR ALL OF US IS A COMPASSIONATE SOCIETY. AND SO THAT'S WHY EVEN THOUGH I'M VERY RELUCTANT TO GO BEYOND. THE ESSENTIAL HEALTH BENEFITS THAT -- YOU KNOW I WANTED TO SUPPORT THIS BILL. PERHAPS THE REAL SOLUTION IS IN THE FUTURE IS THAT WE'RE GOING TO REWORK OUR SEXUAL HEALTH BENEFITS AND WITH ALL THE CONSEQUENCES THAT MAY INVOLVE TO IN TERMS OF COST AND OTHER TYPES OF THINGS. SO -- IT MAYBE THAT IS REALLY AND I APPRECIATE THE OPPOSITE SAY THAT PRIDE RELEASED THE BETTER ANSWER IN THE LONG RUN BUT I FEEL THAT EVEN THE SHORT RUN WE STILL NEED TO DEAL WITH THIS AND AND TAKE CARE OF AND THAT'S WHY I AM GOING. TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY -- SUMMER BLOOM WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE THANK YOU -- ACTUALLY -- MISTER CHAIR YOU HAVE FOR A REALLY JUST SUMMARIZE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT -- THAT I WAS INTENDING TO SAY AND AND CLOSING COM I THINK THIS ISSUE ABOUT THE ESSENTIAL HEALTH BENEFITS AND KIND OF BREACHING THE THE THE WALL OPENING UP THE FLOODGATES AS AS WE HEARD FROM FROM THE OPPOSITION -- THE LIST -- THE LEGISLATURE -- AND THE STATE HAVE BEEN VERY CONSISTENT AND NOT -- IN IN BEING VERY STRICT ABOUT -- HOW THESE ITEMS ARE REVIEWED -- BUT AS YOU SAID MISTER CHAIR I DOUBT THAT THERE IS IN YOU WOULD KNOW BTTER THAN HIGH THAT THERE'S ANYONE ELSE WHO IS ASKED FOR AN EXCEPTION TO THE ESSENTIAL HEALTH BENEFIT ANY OTHER. CONDITION THAT WOULD -- INVOLVES A LIFETIME A POTENTIAL LIFETIME OF DEVELOPMENTAL DELAY AND THAT'S WHAT MAKES THIS DIFFERENT A MATCH IN THESE CHILDREN WHO ARE HERE TODAY WITH THEIR PARENTS -- NOT HAVING THE ACCESS TO HEARING AIDS NOT HAVING THE AXIS IN THERE ARE -- TWO TO THREE HUNDRED CHILDREN EVERY YEAR WHO ARE NOT GETTING HEARING AIDS HEARING AIDS AT ALL BECAUSE OF THE COST AND IT'S JUST NOT HAPPENING -- THOSE CHILDREN. ARE GOING -- TO BEAR THE CONSEQUENCES OF THAT -- DECISION THAT'S BEING MADE BY US THE ADULTS IT'S GOING TO AFFECT THEM. I HAVE. YES WE MAY BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THIS WHEN THE ESSENTIAL HEALTH BENEFITS -- ARE UP FOR REVIEW. IF WE CHOOSE TO REVIEW THEM. IF WE DO IT AT A POINT IN TIME IT'S UNCERTAIN WHEN THAT WOULD. HAPPEN WE KNOW WHEN IT COULD START BUT WE DON'T KNOW WHEN IT WHEN IT ACTUALLY STARTS OR WHEN IT ACTUALLY FINISHES -- AND THEN AT THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE A HUMONGOUS FIGHT OVER WHAT IS THEN INCLUDED IN THE PLANS AND THERE'S NO GUARANTEE THIS IS A THOUSAND CHILDREN THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE. A RELATIVELY SMALL GROUP OF CALIFORNIANS WHO HAVE -- VERY LITTLE POLITICAL POWER IN REALITY COMPARED TO THOSE WHO WILL BE SEEKING BENEFITS ALL OF WHICH MAY BE A VERY IMPORTANT BENEFITS THAT THEY'RE SEEKING SO THERE'S NO GUARANTEE. THAT IT WILL HAPPEN THEN AND SO THEN WHAT FOR ALL OF THOSE CHILDREN WHO DO NOT. HAVE THE ABILITY TO ACCESS HEARING AIDS -- WE NEED TO TAKE ACTION NOW THIS BILL HAS BEEN PENDING AS YOU HEARD FOR A LONG LONG TIME. AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON THEIR BEHALF. I THANK YOU CENTER BLOOM SO DIFFERENT AND IT THAT THOSE BEEN SET -- MOVED AS THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED AND REFERRED TO COMMITTEE APPROPRIATIONS ACTIVITIES CALL THE ROLL AM I AND I STONE. STONE AYE GONZALEZ. GONZALEZ I GROW GROVE I HEARD TACO. LEYVA LEYVA AYE MITCHELL MITCHELL AYE MONNING. RUBIO. RUBIO I'D. SEVEN OF SEVEN VOTES -- THAT'S ENOUGH TO GET THE BILL OUT WILL PUT THE BILL ON CALL FOR ABSENT MEMBERS THANK YOU THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT. I SEE SOMEONE WERE RIVAS HERE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR PATIENCE -- I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN HERE. BEEN WAITING FOR A WHILE SO WE HAVE ITEM NUMBER ELEVEN A. B. NINE TWENTY NINE YES. AT ISSUE WELCOME. THANK YOU inaudible] OKAY. THANK YOU CHAIR AND MEMBERS -- I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING CLOSELY WITH MY OFFICE ON THIS BILL AND I'M HAPPY TO ACCEPT THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS A MOCK UP VERSION OF THE LANGUAGE SHOULD HAVE BEEN PASSED OUT. I'M EXCITED TO PRESENT AB NINE TWO NINE WHICH INSURERS COVERED CALIFORNIA HAS THE AUTHORITY TO COLLECT THE DATA IT NEEDS TO FULLY EVALUATE IF THE HEALTH PLAN IS LOWERING COSTS. IMPROVING QUALITY AND REDUCING HEALTH DISPARITIES. THIS BILL ALSO REQUIRES THAT THE DATA IS DISAGGREGATED AND PUBLISHED BY HEALTH PLAN. CURRENTLY COVERED CALIFORNIA DOESN'T HAVE THE ABILITY DIRECTLY ACCESS THE DATA IT NEEDS TO SEE OF HEALTH DISPARITIES ARE ACTUALLY BEING REDUCED. THEY ALSO DO NOT HAVE THE ABILITY TO DISAGGREGATED DATA BY HEALTH PLAN. WHEN THIS LEGISLATOR CREATED COVERED CALIFORNIA IT GAVE COVERED CALIFORNIA AUTHORITY TO BE AN ACTIVE PURCHASER THAT NEGOTIATED ON COST AND QUALITY? COVERED CALIFORNIA HAS DONE THIS ON BEHALF OF CONSUMERS WHO BUY COVERAGE AS INDIVIDUALS. LOOKING UP PLANS SPECIFIC DATA ON COST QUALITY AND HEALTH DISPARITIES CAN HELP US BETTER UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEMS WHETHER IT'S ACCESS TO CARE OR HEALTH DISPARITIES BETWEEN GROUPS. THE PROCESS TO ELIMINATING HEALTH DISPARITIES AND INEQUITIES STARTS WITH HIGH QUALITY DATA AND AB. NINETY NINE IS THE FIRST STEP -- THANK YOU AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE -- BUT TO FURTHER SPEAK ON THIS BILL I HAVE A FEW WITNESSES IN SUPPORT WITH ME TODAY FROM HEALTH ACCESS AND CALIFORNIA PAN ETHNIC HEALTH NETWORK. THANK YOU SIX MINUTES TOTAL YOU CAN DO LESS OF YOURS. THANK YOU DOCTOR PAN AND JDS HERE ON BEHALF OF HEALTH ACCESS CALIFORNIA THE STATE WIDE HEALTH CARE CONSUMER ADVOCACY COALITION. PRACTICAL SPONSOR AB NINETY NINE WOULD SEE PAN AB NINETY NINE WOULD ENSURE COVER CALIFORNIA HEALTH PLAN DATA ON COST QUALITY HEALTH DISPARITIES. IS COLLECTED AND PUBLISHED. COVER CALIFORNIA IS UNIQUELY POSITIONED TO USE ITS. AUTHORITY AS AN ACTIVE PURCHASE PURCHASER TO NEGOTIATE WITH HEALTH PLANS TO ADVANCE DELIVERY SYSTEMS IMPROVEMENT AND QUALITY IMPROVEMENT. SINCE THE CREATION OF COVERED CALIFORNIA AND ALSO THE ATTACHMENT SEVEN CONTRACT PROVISION IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN PUBLIC REPORTING ON PLAN SPECIFIC CONTRACT COMPLIANCE WITH REQUIREMENTS ON COST. QUALITY AND DISPARITY DATA HAS BEEN THE STATED GOAL. RECENT AMENDMENTS TO THE BILL ENSURES COMPLIANCE WITH THESE CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS THAT THE HEALTH PLANS ACTUALLY HAVE TO COMPLY WITH. AB NINETY NINE DOES NOT CREATE NEW REPORTING REQUIREMENTS IT MERELY ENSURES HEALTH PLANS MEET THEIR EXISTING CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS. AB NINETY NINE ALSO AUTHORIZES COVER CALIFORNIA TO BECOME A HEALTH OVERSIGHT AND TO T. UNDER HIPPA. SO THAT IT CAN SAFE GUARD IMPORTANT DATA AND PERSONAL HEALTH INFORMATION. THIS IS REALLY INTENDED TO CREATE ANOTHER LEVEL OF PROTECTION AND SECURITY SO THAT PERSONAL INFORMATION AND DATA SHALL ONLY BE USE FOR HIPPA. PERMITTED OVERSIGHT ACTIVITIES -- LASTLY AB NINETY NINE ALSO PROTECTS CONFIDENTIAL AND CONTRACTED RATES BETWEEN HEALTH PLANS PROVIDERS SUCH AS DOCTORS AND HOSPITALS AND ANY OTHER COSTS DETAILED. SUCH AS COINSURANCE THAT COULD BE USED TO INFER CONTRACTED RATES. COVER CALIFORNIA HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO MAKE -- PUBLIC PLAN BY PLAN COMPARISONS BECAUSE OF THE PLANTS HAVE ASSERTED THAT DATE ON QUALITY AND DISPARITIES IS PROPRIETARY. BUT BECAUSE THE DATA IS ALSO NOT AVAILABLE IN A USEFUL MANNER COVER CALIFORNIA POLICYMAKERS ADVOCATES AS WELL AS RESEARCHERS ARE NOT ABLE TO USE THE INFORMATION TO THE TERM IN WHICH PLANS ARE ACTUALLY EFFECTIVELY. WITH IMPROVING QUALITY AND REDUCING DISPARITIES DATA IS REALLY ESSENTIAL -- AND FOR THESE REASONS WE REQUEST FULLY RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR IDOL THANK YOU. THANK YOU A GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN SENATORS MARKETS GOT THROUGH WITH THE CALIFORNIA PAN ETHNIC HEALTH NETWORK -- THIS PART OF THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN CONTRACTOR GARMENTS HEALTH PLANS WERE REQUIRED TO SHOW PROGRESS TOWARDS. HEALTH DISPARITIES REDUCTION BY RACE ETHNICITY AND GENDER IN KEY TARGET AREAS WERE DOCUMENTED DISPARITIES EXISTED INCLUDING DIABETES HYPERTENSION ASTHMA AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH -- THE FIRST SET OF DATA COLLECTED FROM THE PLANS FOR THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN YEAR WAS DISCLOSED EARLIER THIS YEAR -- BUT IS PRESENT IN ACCURATE FASHION AND STATED FINING SUCH AS THE BEST PERFORMING PLANNED RANKED ABOVE THE NINETIETH PERCENTILE IN IT FOR DIABETES CONTROL NATIONWIDE WHILE THE LOWEST PERFORMING PLAN RANKED BELOW THE FIFTIETH PERCENTILE -- IN TERMS OF ADDRESSING HEALTH DISPARITIES THIS IS CONCERNING BECAUSE DATA SHOWING THAT IN CALIFORNIA A TINO'S AN AFRICAN AMERICANS ARE. HAVE TWICE THE PREVALENCE OF TYPE TWO DIABETES AND ARE TWICE AS LIKELY TO DIE FROM THE DISEASE. RECENT AMENDMENTS -- TAKEN HELP CLARIFY THE SPECIFIC DATA -- THAT MUST BE REPORTED ON ON A PLAN BY PLAN BASIS AND ALSO REQUIRE ALL OFF SIXTEEN SMALL MARKET. DATA TO BE REPORTED SO THAT WE HAVE SUFFICIENT DATA AND CAN -- DO QUALITY IMPROVEMENT WORK IN THE INDIVIDUAL AND SMALL GROUP MARKET -- BREAKING DOWN THE DATA OF BREAKING DOWN THE ALREADY COLLECTED DATA FURTHER IT WOULD ALLOW US TO SEE WHICH PLANS ARE PERFORMING WELL AND HOW TO IMPLEMENT THOSE PRACTICES IN THE FRONT AND THE PLANS ARE LAGGING BEHIND. HEALTH DISPARITIES INEQUITIES -- CAN ONLY BE ELIMINATED IF THERE IS HIGH QUALITY DATA AVAILABLE TO MORROW -- TO A AND TO MONITOR THE PROBLEMS WITHIN THE HEALTHCARE DELIVERY SYSTEMS AB NINETY NINE IT WOULD GIVE US A BETTER VIEW OF THAT DATA AND FOR THOSE REASONS WE ARE PROUD TO CO SPONSOR AB NINETY NINE AND REQUEST DRIVE THOUGH. AND BEFORE YOU MOVE AND COVER CALIFORNIA'S ALSO HERE TO ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS FOR THE COMMITTEE [inaudible] OKAY. TELLING. YOU INTRODUCE YOURSELF. AT AT THE CHAIRS PLEASURE AT MR TEAR MEMBERS KELLY GREEN DIRECTOR OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS FOR COVER CALIFORNIA. I'VE KATIE RAVEL HERE DIRECTOR OF POLICY ELIGIBILITY IN RESEARCH AND BRANDON ROSS OUR ASSISTANT GENERAL CUNSEL AGAIN HERE FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THANK YOU JUST. A HELPFUL TO HAVE THE INTRODUCTIONS OKAY. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES A SUPPORT. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MARK WINDOWS WITH THAT CA YOU CALIFORNIA AND STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU. AND FLORA ON BEHALF OF WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. MORALE IS AGO REPRESENTING CALIFORNIA CHRONIC CARE COALITION IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. MY NAME IS BOUNDING FROM ASIAN AMERICANS ADVANCING JUSTICE CALIFORNIA AND WE SUPPORT AB NINETY NINE THANK YOU. YOUR HUNGER DENNIS ON BEHALF OF THE LATINO COMMISSION FOR HELP TO CALIFORNIA AND WE STRONG SUPPORT. THANK YOU. HEY THIS IS IN OPPOSITION AND NEED SOME. EXTRA ROOM FOR THEM AT THE TABLE PLEASE. EITHER SCOOT AROUND -- DOWN. I THINK THEY NEED TO SUCCEED WELCOME. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS NICK LOUISE US ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF HEALTH PLANS -- WE HAVE AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED A POSITION ON THE BILL -- SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME -- YOU KNOW ONE OF THE POINTS I'D LIKE TO MAKE RIGHT OUT THE GATE IS THAT -- YOU KNOW WE DON'T VIEW THIS AS A SIMPLE TRANSPARENCY BILL WE WE VIEWED AS AS MUCH MORE -- AB EIGHT NINE TWO NINE EXPRESSLY CONVERTS COVER CALIFORNIA INTO A HEALTH CARE OVERSIGHT AGENCY -- OR TERMS TO DO THREE SO THREE STATE LAW. THIS IS A CHANGE OVER ITS EXISTING POSITION AS AN ACTIVE PURCHASER OF HEALTH CARE COVERAGE -- ANY CHANGES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ON THE EXCHANGE AND A QUALIFIED HEALTH PLANS. THIS CHANGE IN AN OF ITSELF MAY NOT BE INHERENTLY OBJECTIONABLE -- WHICH IS WHY WE ARE NOT -- THE STREET OPPOSE ON THE BILL ON THERE COULD BE BENEFITS TO THIS ARRANGEMENT -- HAVING SAID THAT WE DO HAVE SEVERAL QUESTIONS AND CONCERNS ABOUT THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS POLICY ARE PARTICULARLY AS IT RELATES TO THE DATA SUBMISSION COMPONENTS OF THE BILL -- FIRST CALIFORNIA'S HEALTH PLANS ORAL ALREADY WHO REGULATED BY A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT STATE ENTITIES -- THAT CAN REQUEST VARIOUS LEVELS OF DATA. INFORMATION FOR MY MEMBERS -- SO YOU KNOW WE ALWAYS HAVE THAT CONCERN THAT YOU KNOW LEGISLATION -- ADDS TO YOU KNOW UNNECESSARY DUPLICATION REGULATORY OVERLAP -- WITH OTHER FUNCTIONS. I'M SECOND AS A KIND OF ALLUDED TO EARLIER -- IT'S UNCLEAR -- TEST AT LEAST WITH THE STATE OR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT MUST MAKE THIS NEW OVERSIGHT -- DESIGNATION -- EVEN IF THE STATE DOES HAVE THIS POWER -- YOU KNOW OUR PART THE NEXT SET OF QUESTIONS OVER WHETHER FEDERAL LAW AND REGULATIONS -- CONTEMPLATE -- FOR OR ALLOW FOR THE SUBSTANTIAL DATA SUBMISSION ON THAT IS REQUIRED -- UNDER THIS BILL. COME WE HAVE QUESTIONS WITH THE CONGRESS OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT -- ENVISIONED A STATE BASED EXCHANGE COLLECTING ON THE AMOUNTS OF DETAILED A PERSONAL HEALTH INFORMATION AND A PROVIDER RATE INFORMATION ON THAT IS REQUIRED AND IN THIS BILL. UNDER NINE TWO NINE OF THE DEFINITION OF HEALTH OVERSIGHT FUNCTIONS INCLUDES A MANDATE FOR GENERALIZED DATA. COLLECTION WHICH IS VERY BROAD INTO THE COULD GO BEYOND THE RECOGNIZE FUNCTIONS UNDER THE HIPPA REGULATIONS -- THE HIPPA REGULATIONS PERMIT LIMITED DISCLOSURE OF HEALTH OVERSIGHT AGENCIES -- AND IT ALSO INCLUDES LANGUAGE AROUND A MINIMUM TO SET NECESSARY -- STANDARD -- THAT APPLIES TO DISCLOSURES FROM PLANS TO V. DESIGNATED HEALTH OVERSIGHT ENTITY -- INDEED THE PREAMBLE OF THE HIPPA REGULATIONS ON THIS MATTER INCLUDES THE LINE -- WE DO NOT INTEND FOR THE RULES PERMISSIVE APPROACH TO HEALTH OVERSIGHT OR THE ABSENCE OF SPECIFIC DOCUMENTATION TO PERMIT THE GOVERNMENT. TO GATHER LARGE AMOUNTS OF PROTECTED HEALTH INFORMATION FOR PURPOSES UNRELATED TO HEALTH OVERSIGHT -- SO YOU KNOW WE CUT WERE. TAKING A LOOK AT THIS BILL IT WAS JUST AMENDED -- ABOUT A WEEK AND A HALF AGO. WE HAVE HAD SOME EXTENSIVE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE AUTHORS AND SPONSORS WHICH WE FOUND TO BE MEANINGFUL HELPFUL BUT YOU KNOW. WE DO VIEW AS THE BILL -- REQUIRING A PRETTY EXPANSIVE COLLECTION OF DETAILED PERSONAL HEALTH INFORMATION IN PROVIDER RATES AND THAT ALWAYS MAKES US UNCOMFORTABLE BECAUSE REVIEW THAT INFORMATION IS PROPRIETARY IN NATURE. SOME. THE MEASURE ALSO JUST REQUIRES DISCLOSURE OF X.. AND PUBLIC EXPOSURE OF OFF EXCHANGE DATA IN INFORMATION RELATED TO MARKETS THAT ARE OUTSIDE THE PURVIEW OF COVERED CALIFORNIA -- INCLUDING DATA RELATED TO THE EMPLOYER MARKETS AND MEDI CAL OF COURSE WE WOULD HAVE REGULATORS OVER MEDI CAL AND OVER ON THE EMPLOYER MARKETS AND WE DON'T BELIEVE THERE IS A CLEAR JUSTIFICATION FOR WHY COVER CALIFORNIA NEEDS IS DATA. FOR MARKETS IT DOESN'T OVERSEE WILL DOESN'T OVERSEE YET -- TECHNICALLY ARE OR HOW THEY WILL USE IT -- AND SO WE BELIEVE THAT PORTION OF THE BILL NEEDS TO BE TAKEN OUT -- MUCH OF THE INFORMATION THAT WILL BE TRANSFERRED TO COVER CALIFORNIA -- IS PROPRIETARY NATURE -- WELL THERE'S AN ATTEMPT IN THE BILL TO LIMIT THE PUBLIC EXPOSURE OF PROPRIETARY DATA. THE BILL STILL REQUIRES A SUBMISSION OF SENSITIVE DATA TO THE HEALTH OVERSIGHT AGENCY. OR ENTITY -- AND NOT ALL OF THE INFORMATION IS PROTECTED UNDER THE BILL IN ITS CURRENT FORM -- IS THAT WE CONSIDER PROPRIETARY IS PROTECTED -- UNDER THE BILL -- FOR INSTANCE LIKE TO SPECIFIC STRATEGIES AND TECHNIQUES OF PLANS USED TO LOWER COST REDUCE HEALTH DISPARITIES IN INCREASE QUALITY. ON TEMPLE INVOLVE UNIQUE PAYMENT ARRANGEMENTS BETWEEN THE PLANS IN THE PROVIDERS -- AND THIS INVOLVES INCENTIVES AND DISINCENTIVES USED TO DRIVE A QUALITY AND DRIVE DOWN ON DISPARITIES -- THE PLANS OF COURSE DON'T WANT THEIR COMPETITORS TO EVER GET A HOLD OF THIS INFORMATION -- AND WE'RE NOT SURE THE PROVIDERS WOULD WANT THIS INFORMATION REVEALED AS WELL. HARMS THE MARKET AND COMPLICATES OUR EFFORTS IN THESE AREAS -- WE DO UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF COMBATING HEALTH DISPARITIES IN MAKING QUALITY IMPROVEMENTS -- YOU KNOW THE OTHER POINT WILL MAKE YOU SOME OF THE DATA ASSOCIATED WITH THESE ISSUES ARE NOT CONSISTENT AMONG PLANS BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT STANDARDIZED BY ANY TYPE OF ACCREDITING ORGANIZATION OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT. SO NOT SURE HOW USE LITTLE IT'LL BE. AND HE'LL BE A STRUGGLE TO DO AN APPLES TO APPLES COMPARISON OF THE DATA ON THAT WOULD BE REVEALED A PUBLICLY -- FINALLY -- ORGANIZATIONS PARTICIPATING IN THE HEALTH PAYMENTS DATA REVIEW COMMITTEE THAT WAS ESTABLISHED UNDER EIGHTY EIGHT TEN LAST YEAR -- THE PURPOSE OF THIS COMMITTEE IS TO ESTABLISH A COSTS DATABASE -- USED TO INFORM POLICY DECISIONS REGARDING THE PROVISION OF OF QUALITY HEALTHCARE -- INTO -- LOOK AT REDUCING THE COST OF CARE INTO SUPPORTING GREATER TRANSPARENCY AMONG ALL MARKET SO IT TAKES A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW -- WERE ON THE BOARD OR THE WORK GROUP IF YOU WILL ON THAT AND SO WE'RE WORKING -- TO TO THAT IN A MORE THOUGHTFUL COMPREHENSIVE MATTER THAT'S BEING CONTEMPLATED BY THIS BILL. SO -- YOU KNOW IN SHORTS -- YOU KNOW THE CONVERSATIONS HAVE BEEN PRODUCTIVE YOU KNOW THEM IF THE BILL MOVES TODAY AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING THOSE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE AUTHOR AND SPONSOR. AGAIN WE DON'T VIEW CONCEPTUALLY THE IDEA OF TRANS. MAKING COVER CALIFORNIA HEALTH OVERSIGHT AGENCY IS OBJECTIONABLE IN AND OF ITSELF. THE BILL NEEDS TO BE SCALED DOWN CONSIDERABLY FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE AND WE LIKE TO SHARE SOME IDEAS MOVING FORWARD ON THAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU -- WE'RE OUT OF TIME FOR TESTIMONY CAN INTRODUCE YOURSELF.

DENNIS ARE SENSITIVE TO PRICES -- THE PRICE CONCERNS THEIR PATIENTS HAVE AND THEY NEED THIS TRANSPARENCY TO BE ABLE TO CLEARLY DISCUSS TREATMENT OPTIONS IN OUT OF POCKET COST WITH THEM.

FOR TITLE I LEYVA LEYVA AYE MITCHELL MONNING RUBIO. THE BILL HAS SIX VOTES IT'S ENOUGH TO GET OUT WILL HOLD IT OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS THANK YOU. RIGHT SEVERAL KARA WELCOME SO WHY SHOULD WE TAKE YOUR BILL YOU HAVE THREE BILLS WHO WOULD TAKE THEM AND FOLLOW ORDER NUMBER THAT'S FINE OKAY SO WE'LL. START OFF WITH ITEM NUMBER -- TWO EIGHTY THIRTY FIVE THAT'S WORKER SAFETY PUT. UP BLOOD LEAD LEVELS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- AB THIRTY FIVE WOULD IMPROVE HOW PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS ARE MADE AWARE OF AND HANDLE CASES OF THAT PLACING AMONG WORKERS IN CALIFORNIA AND WOULD HELP PREVENT. REPEATED OR PROLONGED INCIDENTS OF LEAD POISONING AND WORKPLACES. AS WE ALL KNOW THAT CAN HAVE PROFOUND AND PERMANENT ADVERSE HEALTH EFFECTS OF THE CHILDREN ADULTS AND HIGH LEVELS LEAD POISONING CAN BE FATAL. PROLONGED REPEATED CASES OF LEAD POISONING ARE ENTIRELY PREVENTABLE BUT THE PROTOCOLS IN PLACE CURRENTLY DO NOT WORK. AT THIS TIME THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH HAS DISCRETION WHETHER IT'S FOR FOR A CASE OF THAT PLAYS INTO CAL OSHA. AS A RESULT MANY EMPLOYEES TO REMAIN VULNERABLE TO REPEATED THAT EXPOSURE FOR INDETERMINATE MASS THE TIME BEFORE THE ISSUE IS PROPERLY ADDRESS. THIS LOCKS ADMINISTRATION -- Là LEASE TO CASES LIKE THE RECENTLY DISCOVERED GUN RANGE MORE PETERS WERE SUCH HIGH LEVELS OF LEAD RIPPING SPREAD INTO THE SURROUNDING AREA. OF THE ADJACENT CHILDREN'S GYMNASTICS CENTER AFTER TESTING FOR HIGH LEAD LEVELS HOW TO BE SHATTERED AND THE CHILDREN NOW BEING TEST FOR LEAD POISONING. AB THIRTY FIVE IS A COMMON SENSE APPROACH TO HELP ENSURE THAT PROPER NOTIFICATIONS AND FOLLOW UP BETWEEN DEVIATION THE P. H. AND CAL OSHA ARE MADE. IN ORDER TO PROTECT PRESENT AND FUTURE WORKERS AND THEIR FAMILIES. THIS BILL SIMPLY REQUIRES CAL OSHA TO INVESTIGATE WORK SIZE TO HAVE ORKERS WITH ELEVATED BLOOD LEAD LEVELS UPON RECEIVING SUCH REPORTS. FROM DPH WORKER SAFETY SHOULD BE PARAMOUNT NOT JUST TO BUSINESSES BUT ALSO TO THE AGENCY TASS WITH PROTECTING -- THESE WORKERS BUT THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. I THINK YOU IN THIS IS SUPPORT FARM BILL ALLEY -- SPONSORING THE BILL -- FOR ENVIRONMENT ENVIRONMENTAL WORKING GROUP -- THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT BILL FOR WORKERS SAFETY YES -- THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH'S OCCUPATIONAL LEAD POISONING PREVENTION. PROGRAM HAS SOME AUTHORITY IN THIS AREA BUT THEY'VE FALLEN DOWN ON THE JOB WE HAVE REPEATED HIGH BLOOD THAT LEVELS FOR WORKERS AT A ARIETY OF INDUSTRIES. THE WORST BEING GUN RANGES AND BATTERY RECYCLERS BUT IT THERE'S DOZENS OF MORE INDUSTRIES WERE PEOPLE ARE EXPOSED TO LEAD. THIS BILL DOESN'T SAY FIND SOMEONE IN FOR SITE DAMAGES SAYS HANDOVER TO CAL OSHA GO OUT AND TAKE A LOOK THEY CAN CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT HELPS -- L. P. P. P. BUT IF NEED BE THEY COULD FIND THAT SIX MONTHS TO FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO. AND WE THINK THAT'S PLENTY OF TIME TO RESOLVE IT IN A CONVERSATIONS WITH CAL OSHA. THEY SAID -- THEY HAVE TO HAVE STRONG EVIDENCE TO ISSUE A FINER CITATION ANYWAY THE IMPORTANT THING IS WE WANT A DIFFERENT AGENCY LOOKING AT THIS BECAUSE FRANKLY. I THE O. L. P. P. P. HAS NOT DONE A GOOD JOB OF KNOCKING THESE BY THE LEVELS DOWN ALSO IF THE LEVELS ARE BELOW TWENTY ONE MICROGRAMS PER DECILITER THEY CAN WORK WITH ALL THOSE HUNDREDS OF WORKERS IF NOT THOUSANDS IN THE STATE. TO FIND OUT WHY SOME AS TENER EIGHTEEN BUT NOT THE ALARM BELL LEVEL OF TWENTY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU MISTER MEMBERS MUCH TIGHTER WITH CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THE BILL. THAT WE SEE IS JUST A MEASURE TO DIRECT ONE AGENCY TO TRANSFER DATA TO ANOTHER THAT THE LATTER NEEDS TO ADEQUATELY PERFORM ITS DUTY OF IN THIS CASE KEEPING WORKERS SAFE ON THE JOB. IT'S EXTREMELY HARD TO THINK OF REASONS TO ESSENTIALLY KEEP. HIDING THE STATE OF FROM CAL OSHA WHICH IS ARGUABLY WHAT HAPPENED UNDER THE CURRENT SYSTEM WHERE SOMETIMES IS TRANSFERRED OVER SOMETIMES IT'S NOT. ESPECIALLY GIVEN A HAZARDOUS INSIDIOUS AS LEAD EXPOSURE AND ESPECIALLY GIVEN THAT WE'VE GOT A VERY SERIOUS PROBLEM IN THE WORKER HEALTH AND SAFETY WORLD WITH CALIBRATION NOT. ALREADY RECEIVING INFORMATION THAT THEY'RE ENTITLED TO WHEN IT COMES TO OUR FACILITIES AND SERIOUS ACCIDENTS CALLUSES SUPPOSED TO BE NOTIFIED OF THOSE IN EIGHT HOURS. ABOUT HALF THE TIME THEY'RE NEVER NOTIFIED BY THE EMPLOYER ORTHE FIRST RESPONDER WITH RESPECT TO COMPLAINTS -- CAN A WORKERS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE PROTECTED FROM RETALIATION WHEN THEY REPORT COMPLAINTS BUT IT'S SO COMMON THAT WE ESSENTIALLY HAVE TO COUNSEL WORKERS THAT. VERY POSSIBLY GOING TO GET FIRED IS COMMITTED AGAINST THE REPORT THIS SO. ALL ACROSS THE BOARD IN WORKER HEALTH AND SAFETY WE NEED TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO GET MORE INFORMATION INTO THE HANDS OF COLLEGE OF RATHER THAN LAST. AND WITH LEAD EXPOSURE IT'S ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT ESPECIALLY ONCE WE GOT A BLOOD LEAD LEVEL OF OF OF TWENTY MICROGRAMS PER DECILITER. THAT'S BY DEFINITION OF A SERIOUS PHYSICAL AND A SERIOUS PHYSICAL HARM IN THAT IT MEETS THE CRITERIA FOR BEING A SERIOUS VIOLATION OF WHEN THE CALLS FOR INVESTIGATION BY CAL OSHA. AND AGAIN AS MENTIONED THIS BILL DOESN'T REQUIRE AN INSPECTION ALL IT DOES IS GIVE THE APPROPRIATE INFORMATION TO THE APPROPRIATE AGENCIES SO THAT THEY CAN MAKE A DETERMINATION ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT REQUIRES A PHYSICAL INSPECTION AND AS IS OFTEN THE CASE THEY CAN TELL FROM THEIR INITIAL INSPECTION WHETHER OR NOT. THEY NEED TO DO ONE AND WHETHER OR NOT THERE ARE OTHER VIOLATIONS HAPPENING AS WELL SO TO KEEP THIS INFORMATION IN THE HANDS OF CD PH THEN. NOT ONLY MAKES IT A LOT MORE LIKELY THAT THE HAZARD OF LEAD EXPOSURE CONTINUES BUT THAT A WIDE VARIETY OF OTHER SAFETY HAZARDS MAY CONTINUE FURTHER JEOPARDIZING THOSE WORKERS HEALTH WE ARE -- SPARK. THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. MY NAME IS BY HAVING FROM ASIAN AMERICANS ADVANCING JUSTICE CALIFORNIA AND BE SUPPORT AB. THIRTY FIVE THANK YOU. MELISSA ROMERO AT THE CALIFORNIA LEAGUE OF CONSERVATION VOTERS IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU. RIGHT WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. PLEASE COME UP TO THE TABLE WELCOME. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR -- MEMBERS ROBERT MACHINE FOR THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND WE ARE IN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION -- SO AT FIRST TO BE CLEAR OUR POSITION IS NOT BASED ANYWAY ON A YOU KNOW ON TRYING TO DIET PREVENTS THE LEAD REGULATIONS WHICH ARE COMING DOWN THE PIPE TO TO LOWER STANDARDS OR TO PROTECT. NOT PREVENT PROTECTION OUR WORKERS FROM LEAD OUR VISION IS MAINLY FOCUSED ON THE TECHNIQUE THIS BILL USES IN ORDER -- IN HOW IT DIVIDE THE RESPONSIBILITIES BETWEEN THE TWO AGENCIES DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND CAL OSHA. I'M WE BELIEVE THERE IS A BETTER SET OF AMENDMENTS WHICH WE HAVE PASSED THE OFTEN WE'VE BEEN TALKS ABOUT AND WE APPRECIATE THOSE WITH THAT WORK -- TO CLARIFY THE ROLE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND CAL OSHA TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S MORE EFFICIENT IN PROTECTING WORKERS EFFICIENT FOR THE BUSINESS AND AT AND IS AS WE REDID. EFFICIENT FOR THE COST OF THE STATE -- SIR TO TO CLARIFY -- AS JUST STATED WE DO THINK THERE'S AN ISSUE WITH THE DISCRETION PRESENTLY ALLOWED TO DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH THEIR DISCRETION WHEN THEY FOR THE CASE TO CAL OSHA IS -- IS OVER BROUGHT AND THERE HAVE BEEN ISSUES THERE AND WE ABSOLUTELY DO NOT YOU MEAN TO DEFEND THEIR FAILURE TO FORWARD. HOWEVER WE BELIEVE IN OUR AMENDMENTS THE SOLUTION TO THAT OVER DISCRETION. IS TO LIMIT THEIR DISCRETION WITH GUARD RAILS NOT TO THROW THEM OUT O THE PROCESS AND WE BELIEVE THAT THEY PROVIDE SOME VALUABLE -- ROLES IN TIMES OF THEIR COLLABORATIVE PROCESS. SO FAR AMENDMENTS AND AND WE ARE IN TALKS ABOUT THESE WOULD LIMIT THAT TO A SCHEDULED TO SAY YOU KNOW YOU HAVE THIS MANY WEEKS TO DEAL WITH THIS TO PROVIDE A QUICK SOLUTION IF YOU CAN'T. THEN KICK IT TO CAL OSHA HAVE BEEN TREATED SERIOUS VIOLATION AS THE BILL DOES PRESENTLY -- YEAH I HAVE ONE QUICK EXAMPLE -- TO TO KIND OF CLARIFY SOME OF THE FACTS ABOUT THIS SO. BECAUSE BLOOD LEVELS RIGHT RISE OVER TIME AND FALL OVER TIME ONE OF THE ISSUES WITH THIS BILL WE THINK IS THAT -- LET'S SAY YOU HAVE A WORKER IN A WE HAVE A MEMBER COMPANY FROM THE BATTERY COUNSELOR NATIONAL WHO. WERE HERE BUT I JUST WHICH COMMITTEES -- AND JOIN US THIS POSITION. I LIVE IN PLACE TO HANDLE THE LEVELS THEY FOUND THE LAST TEST TO THOSE EMPLOYEES WERE NEW. THEY INVESTIGATED THE FOUND OUT FAILURE TO PROPERLY PROPER INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE IT'S A SIMPLE AS YOU KNOW WASH YOUR HANDS BEFORE YOU EAT LUNCH IN WORKING WITH LET. THE LEVELS GOING TO GO UP. RIGHTS THEY PROVIDED ADDITIONAL TRAINING THOSE EMPLOYEES THEY TALKED ULTRA P. ABOUT IT. THOSE WILL BE FIXED OVER TIME BUT THEY'LL PROBABLY HAVE MULTIPLE READINGS WITH A MAYBE ABOUT LEVEL. UNDER THIS BILL YOU'RE GONNA HAVE MULTIPLE READINGS AUTOMATICALLY KICK TO CAL OSHA CAL OSHA THAN HAS TO AUTOMATICALLY TREAT A SERIOUS VIOLATION. EVEN THOUGH WE KNOW WHAT THE CAUSES AND IT'S BEING ARE BEING WORKED ON AND FIX OVER TIME. TO SITUATIONS LIKE THAT THAT WE THINK THIS IS KIND OF A AN OVERLY BLUNT APPROACH AND WE HELPED ARMAMENTS CAN CLARIFY THAT -- SO FOR THAT REASON OPPOSE LESS AMENDED THANK YOU OKAY THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SAYING NONE COMMITTEE MEMBER QUESTIONS CENTER GROVE. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER FOR BRINGING THE BILL FORWARD I DO HAVE QUESTIONS -- AT THE WITNESS STATED THAT -- AT SOME MADE THE AGENCY ISN'T ALWAYS TRANSFERRING THE INFORMATION TO CALIBRATION -- IT IN IT'S REQUIRED FOR THAT INFORMATION GO TO CALIFORNIA. THAT THAT'S WHAT IN IT ELEVATED LEVELS WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WITH ELEVATED LEVELS OF LEAD THEN IT WOULD BE REQUIRED TO TRANSMIT IT TO GET TO CAL OSHA IS THIS -- WANT SOMEBODY FILES A WORKERS COMP CLAIM THIS PROCESS IS GOING TO TAKE PLACE. NO DIFFERENT WORKERS COMP AND WE% JUST GOT RECENTLY GOT DATA FROM THE DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH AND HOW OFTEN THEY REFER THESE CASE OF A CAL OSHA. SIX TIMES IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS WHEN THERE'S DOZENS AND DOZENS OF CASES PER YEAR THAT THEY COULD REFER OVER. SO THEY'VE USER DISCRETION VERY VERY TO DISCRIMINATE WAY AND HAVING PASS THEM ON OKAY SO I GUESS I'M WONDERING SOMEBODY'S GONNA TO EDUCATE ME LIKE HOW YOU'RE GONNA OBTAIN THE BLOOD IN THE FIRST PLACE TO SOMEBODY FELLOW WORKERS COMP CLAIM AND SAY. YOU KNOW I FEEL DIZZY I DON'T FEEL GOOD WHATEVER THAT WHATEVER THAT ISSUES ARE RIGHT WHATEVER THE SIDE EFFECTS ARE THE SYMPTOMS. AND AND THEN THE FILE WORKERS COMP CLAIM AND THEN HOW DO YOU OBTAIN THE BLOOD OR THE TESTING FOR THAT. IS IT SOMEBODY GETS INJURED ON THE JOB GOD FOR BID AND AND IT REQUIRES EMERGENCY SERVICES AND THEN THEY TAKE SOMEONE'S BLOOD IN THE NEW RELEASE THAT INFORMATION WITHOUT THE EMPLOYEES AUTHORIZATION. I MEAN I'M JUST CONCERNED ABOUT THE PROCESS OF SOMEBODY COULD EXPLAIN THAT TO ME I'D REALLY APPRECIATE THE CHECK FOR A MOMENT. YES BILL ALLEY OKAY WITH THE WG -- IN ANY WORK SITE WERE LED-EXPOSURES A CONCERNED YOU MUST HAVE YOUR EMPLOYEES -- BLOOD LIKE TESTED AT LEAST TWICE A YEAR AND THAT DATA IS AUTOMATICALLY TRANSFERRED TO DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH SO IT HAS NOTHING TO THE WORKERS COMP. SO IF YOU WORK WHETHER A BATTERY RECYCLING SANDBLASTING COATINGS GUN RANGES YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO SEND ALL THIS DATA. YOU TOO MUST SEND ALL THE DATA TO SEE PH TO ACCUMULATE SAID AND HAS A DATABASE. SO -- IT'S AUTOMATIC WE DONE BY LAW I THINK BY REGULATION ACTUALLY. THAT'S HOW THEY GET THOSE NUMBERS AND THE WORKERS THEN CAN BE TOLD YOU HAVE HIGH BLOOD LEVELS. IS IT ESTABLISH A BASELINE IS THERE A BASS LINE ESTABLISH AND THEN IT EXCEEDS THE BASS LINE THAT WAS ESTABLISHED OR JUST. BUT WHAT IF THEY START MERETE EXCEED THE BASELINE OF TWENTY IT WAS WHAT I THOUGHT IT WAS RIGHT TWENTY MAYBE. THIS BILL IS BEEN VERY IT'S A OF THE ALARM LEVELS OR RIGHT NOW CAL OSHA'S REDOING THEIR REGULATIONS BEEN UNDER PROCESS FOR SEVEN YEARS ASSEMBLY MEMBER QUIRK BECAUSE A BILL TO SPEED THOSE REGULATIONS UP IN ADOPTING NEXT YEAR -- THE THE CHANGES THE THE LEVELS IN THE BLOOD IN WHICH THE WORKER IS AUTOMATICALLY SENT HOME TAKEN OFF THE WORK SITE ALSO CHANGES THE AMBIENCE LEAD LEVELS IN THE AIR BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH AB THIRTY FIVE THE BILL BEFORE YOUR COMMITTEE. WHICH IS ABOUT GETTING THEM REFERRED TO CAL OSHA FOR INSPECTION THE INSPECTION ACTUALLY IT'S CALLED NOT REFERRAL BUT A COMPLAINT TO TECHNICALLY AS THAT WOULD CAL OSHA CALLS IT. SHOULD BE A COMPLAINT FROM THEY SAID THEY GET TEN TO THIRTEEN THOUSAND COMPLAINTS A YEAR FOR ALL DIFFERENT WORKS WORK THINGS SO. THIS LOOKING AT THE DATA WOULD ADD A FEW DOZEN MORE THIRTY EIGHTY MORE AND THEY SAID WE CAN HANDLE THAT AN APPROACH THEY SAID. SEVEN HUNDRED ABOUT SEVEN OR EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR TO HANDLE THIS INCREASED WORKLOAD. WE JUST SUPPOSE THAT AGAINST YOU KNOW OF HUNDREDS OF THOUSAND DOLLARS IN MEDICAL COSTS FOR PEOPLE WHO LOSE WORK TIME AND GET SICK TREMORS -- NERVE DAMAGE HEART DISEASE CAUSED BY HIGH BLOOD LEVELS. AND I WOULD ARGUE MILLIONS MORE TO ADD STAFFING DPH TO ACTUALLY. DO WHAT IS BEING SUGGESTED BY OPPOSITION TO BEEF UP FOR THEM TO FOLLOW UP ON BEFORE SENDING IT OVER TO OSHA ACTIVATED RIGHT NOW PART OF THE REASON WHY -- DPH ISN'T FALLING THROUGH AWESOME THIS THERE'S UNDERSTAFFED -- THE PUSH TO THE THE APPROPRIATE INVESTIGATIVE ARMS OSHA -- AND DPH IS NOT KICKED OUT OF THE PROCESS TO PHD AS PART OF THE PROCESS THE WHOLE TIME TO CONTINUE TO BE PART OF THE PROCESS. SO THAT IF AN INVESTIGATION DONE BY OSHA SHOWS THAT THERE'S SOME PROCEDURAL ASPECTS OF THE WORK SITE THAT DON'T REALLY LEND ITSELF TO A LARGE MINOR CITATION OR OF BUT WAS STORED AND AT FIRST THEY CAN WORK WITH DPH TO PICK SOME OF THOSE ISSUES AS WAS. REFERRED TO AS THE HAND WASHING ISSUE OR SOMETHING MINOR LIKE THAT DPH IS STILL VERY MUCH PART OF THE PROCESS. SO THESE EMPLOYER IN A REPORT TO BOTH AGENCIES CENTERS THERE ONE BLOOD TESTS THAT SUBMITTED TO BOTH AGENCIES THE AGAINST AN ENTITY PH AND THEN DPH WITHOUT THE TRANSMITTED THAT'S ABOUT THE ELEVATED LEVEL TO OSHA. OKAY IF I COULD BRIEFLY CLARIFY -- I'LL BE VERY PRETTY. LAID THE AFTERNOON -- ONE OF THE ISSUES WHICH WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS BILL IS THAT THE PRESENTLY COMING DOWN THE PIPE LED REGULATIONS -- REFLECT DIFFERENT LEVELS THAT PRESENTLY EXISTS AND THIS BILLS TWENTY IS NOT ACTUALLY TIED TO A NUMBER THAT RACK ONE OF THE MEN WITH YOU PROPOSED. IS TO HAVE THIS BILL REFER TO A LEVEL IN THE REGULATIONS THAT HAS THE REGULATIONS CHANGE THIS BILL WILL SHIFT WITH IT -- I THINK THAT SOME THE TWENTY OTHER IS PRIMARY LANGUAGE AND IN HERE SUCH THAT IF COLLISON THE FUTURE DOES ADOPT STRICTER REGULATIONS PURSUANT TO THEIR OF ON GOING. PROCESS THAT THIS WOULD THIS WOULD CHANGE ALONG WITH CAL OSHA'S RECOMMENDATION. THANK YOU SIR THANK YOU THANK YOU. CENTER STONE THANK YOU -- THANK YOU MISTER CARR OF IN MY REPORT IS SHOWS OVER THE PAST EIGHTEEN YEARS THERE'S BEEN A 54% DECREASE IN THE NATIONAL PREVALENCE OF BLOOD LEAD LEVELS THE GREAT OF AN EQUAL TO TWENTY FIVE MICROGRAMS. PER DECILITER [inaudible] AND DO YOU WANT TO LOWER THAT THRESHOLD. TO TWENTY MICROGRAMS PER DECILITER FROM FIFTY WHICH IS A A 60% DECREASE IN THAT HAVE OVER TO OSHA -- I'M CONCERNED ABOUT SUCH A DRACONIAN -- THRESHOLD DECREASE -- AND IN LIGHT OF ALSO -- THIS BILL WAS -- SUBMITTED TO ALMOST THE EXACT SAME BILL AB. TWENTY NINE SIXTY THREE AND GOVERNOR BROWN VETOED IT -- CLAIMING THIS DEPARTMENT HEALTH WORKS FOR QUIET CORNER COLLABORATIVELY WITH EMPLOYERS TO REDUCE. WORKER EXPOSURE TO LETTER REFERS EMPLOYERS TO THE DEPARTMENT FOR ENFORCEMENT UPDATED ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS SO WE SEE A DECREASE INCIDENCE A HIGHER SENSITIVITY. AND SYSTEM SEEMS TO BE WORKING IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH. WHAT'S DIFFERENT ABOUT THIS BILL. I DON'T BELIEVE THE SYSTEM HAS BEEN WORKING IN A BIG DROP IN THOSE CASES REPORTED CASES THE FACT THAT EXCITE WAS CLOSED. THAT WAS A BIG BUT A NUMBER OF THOSE CASES THE TWENTY MICROGRAMS IS WHAT OSHA IS RECOMMENDING SWIRL THAT WERE BURGER LYING ON OUR EXPERTS TO TELL US WHAT. THAT NUMBER SHOULD BE A WHAT IS OUR SCIENTIFIC BASIS FOR THAT ONE OF THE OTHER RECORDING SUSPENDED AND CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL. DATA YES THE FEDERAL -- LEVEL OF RESPONSE I BELIEVE IS TWENTY FIVE MAY BE STAFFERS THIS TWENTY FIVE PIC CALLOW SHOULD TOLD US LAST YEAR WHEN WE'RE DING AB TWENTY NINE SIXTY THREE THAT.% USE TWENTY WERE COMFORTABLE WITH THAT IT'S A BETTER LEVEL MORE PROTECTIVE OF WORKER HEALTH. THAT SO THAT'S WHERE THE COMES FROM SO FEDERAL ACTION LEVELS TWENTY FIVE CALIFORNIA BE TWENTY OTHER STATES HE'S TWENTY ALSO. OKAY THANK YOU [inaudible] THE SERVER. I JUST LIKE THAT I JUST HAVE ONE MORE QUESTION SO IT SAYS IN THE LANGUAGE THAT THE BILL WOULD FURTHER PROVIDE THAT THE ABOVE DESCRIBED REPORT WOULD CAN TO CONSTITUTE A SERIOUS VIOLATION WITH OSHA -- IS A SERIOUS VIOLATION WITH OSHO WITHOUT AN INVESTIGATION TO SHOW THAT THE GUY STARTED -- WITH YOU KNOW HIGH BLOOD LEVELS OR IS IT JUST AN AUTOMATIC SERIOUS VIOLATION FIND WHICH COULD BE THOUSANDS UPON THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS AND AND AS IT CAME OUT WITH IS THAT THE TERM OF ART THAT ACTUALLY TRIGGERS. THE THE INVESTIGATION IT DOESN'T REQUIRE A CONCLUSION OF THE INVESTIGATION TO BE ANY WORDS. IT DOESN'T IT DOESN'T BUT BECAUSE OF THAT THIS YEAR'S VIOLATIONS THE TRIGGERING A TRIGGERING TERM. BY TRIGGERING IT NOW -- CHICKEN BASKET THEY CAN DO BUT THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH THE INDIAN THAT THERE WAS A ONE OFF THAT PARTICULAR DAY THAT'S NOT RELATED TO THE OPERATION OF THE BUSINESS. BY NATE BY LABELING A SERIOUS VIOLATION IN NO WAY DOES THAT PREJUDICE -- THE EMPLOYER WHAT IT DOES IT TRIGGERS A TRIGGERS INVESTIGATION. SO I HAVE TO PICK A DIFFERENT BECAUSE I'M EMPLOYER AND DIVERT IN TWENTY SIX YEARS -- SHOULD ON RIDERSHIP ONE TIME FOR AN INJURY THAT TOOK PLACE IN IN IN IN INDUSTRY -- THAT WE WERE DEEMED NOT RESPONSIBLE BUT AN BUT TO HAVE A SERIOUS VIOLATION AGAINST YOU UNDER CAL OSHA PROHIBITS YOU FROM HAVING CONTRACTS. PROHIBIT YOU FROM GAINING CONTRACTS ESPECIALLY IN THE OIL INDUSTRY THE AG INDUSTRY THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS THAT AFFECT EMPLOYERS AND IF THERE'S IS AN AUTOMATIC SERIOUS VIOLATION ATTACHED TO THIS. WHEN THERE? COULD BE A FINDING OF NO GUILT WHATSOEVER THAT THAT'S A HUGE CONCERN. AND THAT COULD VERY WELL BE THE CONCLUSION OF THOSE SHOWS THAT THERE IS NO VIOLATION IT IT'S IT'SLABELING ISSUES VIOLATION FOR THE PURPOSE OF TRICKING THE INVESTIGATION. BUT THEN OCEAN WILL DO THE INVESTIGATION AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE INVESTIGATION -- SHALL DECIDE WHAT -- WHAT WE'LL DO WHAT WILL BUT THE CONCLUSION OF THAT INVESTIGATION WILL BE? THE DON'T YOU THINK IT SHOULD SAY AS IT WOULD THIS THAT THE BILL WOULD FURTHER PROVIDE THAT THE ABOVE -- DESCRIBE REPORT WOULD CONSTITUTE A SERIOUS ALLEGED VIOLATION INSTEAD OF A MANDATED SERIOUS VIOLATION. THIS MIMICS FEDERAL LANGUAGE AS TO HOW AN INVESTIGATION IS TRIGGERED BUT ONCE AGAIN -- THAT THE THE DEEMING A BIT OF A SERIOUS VIOLATION IS FOR THE PURPOSE THE TRIGGERING THE INVESTIGATION -- SECOND TEAM THAT THERE IS NO VIOLATION THE CONDITION THAT THERE'S NO CITATION THEY CONTEND THAT THE COULD BE A REALLY QUICK FIX -- AND SO AGAIN IT'S A TERM OF ART -- NOT SOMETHING THAT IS GOING TO BE ON A PERMANENT RECORD BUSINESS THE EXTENT THAT OSHO DEEMED A SERIOUS VIOLATION. THAT TRIGGERS THE INVESTIGATION AND AGAIN THIS ISN'T THIS MIMICS FEDERAL LAW -- IN TERMS WHAT WOULD REQUIRE -- BUT LAUNCH AN INVESTIGATION ACCORDING TO FEDERAL LAW AS WELL. THANK YOU SIR THANK YOU. THE OTHER QUESTIONS [inaudible] OKAY SO. SOME OF HER AYE -- JEFF FISHER YOU BRING THIS BILL FORD. YEAH I I THINK WAS AS WE DISCUSSED BEFORE -- AND AND I APPRECIATE WHAT THE OPPOSITION SAYING BUT FRANKLY THE THE PART OF PUBLIC HEALTH -- AT LEAST RIGHT NOW DOESN'T REALLY HAVE THE STAFF TO DO MUCH OF AN INVESTIGATION BEYOND WE RECEIVED THE BLOOD LOVE LEVEL TEST AND REVIEW THEM AND SAY. AND SO FORTH AND AND ACTUALLY YOU KNOW SINCE I CHAIR THE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AYE I ACTUALLY HOPE THAT PERHAPS THE CHAMBER AND OTHERS MIGHT ACTUALLY PUT IN A BUDGET REQUEST FOR MORE STAFF FOR THE LEAD. THAT FOR THE OCCUPATIONAL LED THE VISION. FOR THE FARM PUBLIC HEALTH -- BEYOND WHAT THE GOVERNOR HAS PROPOSED TO FAR SO -- OUR WORK WITH THE GOVERNOR TO TO INCREASE THE STAFFING SO THAT THEY COULD HAVE MORE CAPACITY TO DO SO BUT I THINK IN THE ABSENCE OF THAT. THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO DO ON SITE INVESTIGATIONS TO FIGURE OUT AND CAL OSHA IS THE AGENCY THAT'S CHARGED WITH THE LEAST ONSITE INVESTIGATIONS -- SO -- TO ME WELL IT'S NOT IDEAL -- IT IT DID GIVEN THE REALITIES WHAT WE'RE FACING RIGHT NOW I DATE AND AND THE SERIOUSNESS OF LEAD -- POISONING THAT I THINK -- THIS IS A REASONABLE SOLUTION TO THE TO THE CURRENT PROBLEM -- AND AND ENSURE INVESTIGATION I WOULD MAKE NOTE THAT -- AS YOU SAID IT'S IT'S REALLY AN ALLOCATION OF THIS YEAR'S VIOLATION OF COURSE HAS. TO THAT YOU KNOW THERE'S AN INVESTIGATION AND THE BUSINESS HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO DEMONSTRATE ITS THERE AND THEY'RE NOT THE ONES WHERE THE AT FAULT RIGHT AND AND SO. SO WE CERTAINLY WE DO NOT WANT TO PRESUME. IT BUSINESSES IS CAUSING SOMETHING BUT WE NEED TO FIND WE'D HAVE A RESULT THAT SHOWS A PROBLEM THERE NEEDS TO BE AN INVESTIGATION TO IDENTIFY WHAT THE CAUSES. AND THAT'S ALSO FOR THE SAFETY AND HEALTH OF THAT WORKER AND ALSO THEIR FAMILY BY THE WAY I MEAN I'M A PEDIATRICIAN SO THERE HAS THERE'S BLOOD LEVELS THAT HIGH. WHAT A BRING HOME FROM WORK CA HOURS A COMING FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE IS ACTING FOR THE WORKPLACE WE NEED TO KNOW WHERE IT'S COMING FROM SO? WITH THAT -- IS THERE A MOTION ON THE BILL IT'S BEEN MOVED -- SO RICARDO JULY CLOSE APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS MISTER CHAIR AND-AGREE THAT THE STOCKS COULD BE A COST SAVING TO EMPLOYERS THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO IDENTIFY AND ISSUE EARLIER RATHER THAN THREE FOUR FIVE YEARS ON THE LINE -- WAS GONNA COST MILLIONS ARE MUCH MORE POTENTIALLY TO MITIGATE THIS IS ACTUALLY I CAN BE VERY GOOD FROM PLAYERS AS WELL AS WITH THAT RESPECT YES WHEN I BOUGHT. I THANK YOU SO THE MOTION IS -- DO PASS REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON LABOR PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT RETIREMENT SO SAID GOING TO ANOTHER COMMITTEE AND I GUESS I'LL SEE IT THERE -- TOO SAYS OCCURRED PLEASE CALL THE ROLL CAN HI AND I STONE STONE NO GONZALEZ GONZALEZ I GROWTH.

AB FIFTY ALSO SETS OUT NEEDED ADJUSTMENTS FOR FAIR PROVIDER REIMBURSEMENT AND REQUIRES ENGAGE MISTAKE ORDERS FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. THE ASSISTANT LIVING WAIVER PROGRAM PROVIDES A CRITICAL COMMUNITY BASED ALTERNATIVES. TO INSTITUTIONALIZATION FOR ELIGIBLE OLDER ADULTS AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES I MEDI CAL. THE WAIVER PROGRAM ALSO ALIGNS WITH THE STATE'S COMMITMENT OF THE OLMSTEAD DECISION. BUYING THAT THE UNNECESSARY INSTITUTIONALIZATION OF PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES IS A VIOLATION OF THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT. THEREBY ESTABLISHING THE RIGHT OF INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES TO RECEIVE SERVICES IN THE MOST INTEGRATED SETTING. EVEN THOUGH THE DEPARTMENT RENEW THE WAIVER PROGRAM FOR ANOTHER FIVE YEARS. THERE HAS BEEN DISCUSSION TO INTEGRATE THE PROGRAM AT THE HOME AND COMMUNITY BOARD SERVICE BASED SERVICES WAIVER. AND AB FIFTY INCLUDES LANGUAGE ACCOUNT FOR THAT TRANSITION ALLOWS THE DEPARTMENT TO RAMP UP SERVICES PRIOR TO THAT OCCURRING.
