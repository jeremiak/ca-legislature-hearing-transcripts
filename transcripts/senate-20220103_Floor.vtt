FUNNY. OFTEN SATIRICAL AND MOST

00:29:58.796 --> 00:30:00.365
OF ALL THOUGHT PROVOKING.

00:30:00.431 --> 00:30:02.367
RICHARD ALWAYS HIT THE NAIL ON

00:30:02.433 --> 00:30:04.235
THE HEAD WHEN A BILL PROPOSED

00:30:04.302 --> 00:30:06.871
CREATING A NEW STATE AGENCY

00:30:06.938 --> 00:30:09.474

OFTEN ASKED POINTED QUESTIONS

00:30:11.309 --> 00:30:12.944
SUCH AS IT IS THERE NO OTHER

00:30:13.011 --> 00:30:14.779
EXISTING GOVERNMENT ENTITY THAT

00:30:14.846 --> 00:30:16.481
CAN BE UTILIZED INSTEAD OF

00:30:16.548 --> 00:30:19.684
REINVENTING THE WHEEL. AGAIN

00:30:19.751 --> 00:30:21.486
HERE'S A FAVORITE PASSAGE THAT

00:30:21.553 --> 00:30:24.122
RICHARD OFTEN PINNED TO QUOTE.

00:30:24.189 --> 00:30:25.456
WHY DO WE NEED A SEPARATE AND

00:30:25.523 --> 00:30:28.326
DISTINCT COMMISSION TO STUDY.

00:30:28.393 --> 00:30:30.728
THIS ISSUE YET AGAIN WHY

00:30:30.795 --> 00:30:32.030
ESTABLISHED YET ANOTHER

00:30:32.096 --> 00:30:33.565
COMMISSION IN THE STATE

00:30:33.631 --> 00:30:34.632
GOVERNMENT WHEN THE GOVERNOR HAS

00:30:34.699 --> 00:30:36.901
ALREADY ISSUED AN EXECUTIVE

00:30:36.968 --> 00:30:39.037
ORDER CREATING ESSENTIALLY THE

00:30:39.103 --> 00:30:42.440
SAME THING. AND I WELL MAYBE A

00:30:42.507 --> 00:30:43.741
QUESTION TO ALEX AZAR WOULD BE

00:30:43.808 --> 00:30:46.144
IS HOW MANY TIMES DID THAT SHOW

00:30:46.211 --> 00:30:48.346
UP IN IN A IN AN ANALYSIS. ONE

00:30:48.413 --> 00:30:49.514
OF RICHARD'S FAVORITE TARGETS

00:30:49.581 --> 00:30:51.583
WAS THE LITANY OF EXEMPTIONS.

00:30:51.649 --> 00:30:52.350
AND CARVE OUTS OF THE

00:30:52.417 --> 00:30:54.118
LEGISLATURE MAKES EVERY YEAR TO

00:30:54.185 --> 00:30:55.920
THE TIED HOUSE LAW. WITH RICHARD

00:30:55.987 --> 00:30:57.522
OFTEN RAISING THE QUESTION OF

00:30:57.589 --> 00:30:59.290
HOW ABOUT LETTING THE MODERN.

00:30:59.357 --> 00:31:01.426
MARKET PLACE DEAL WITH THIS

00:31:01.492 --> 00:31:02.660
RATHER THAN PROPPING UP THIS R.

00:31:02.727 --> 00:31:05.897
K. GOVERNMENT SYSTEM OF CONTROL.

00:31:05.964 --> 00:31:09.000
RICHARD STAYED. TRUE TO THE FREE

00:31:09.067 --> 00:31:12.103
MARKET PRINCIPLES AND WROTE. THE

00:31:12.170 --> 00:31:14.305
ABC ACTORS PUNCHED FULL OF HOLES

00:31:14.372 --> 00:31:16.541
ALREADY. WHY NOT JUST FIX THIS

00:31:16.608 --> 00:31:18.376
SECTION OF LAW SO THAT EVERY NEW

00:31:18.443 --> 00:31:20.211
DEVELOPMENT STADIUM ARENA

00:31:20.278 --> 00:31:23.081
THEATRE ETCETERA. DOES NOT NEED

00:31:23.147 --> 00:31:23.982
TO COME CRAWLING TO THE

00:31:24.048 --> 00:31:25.683
LEGISLATURE SEEKING LEGAL

00:31:25.750 --> 00:31:27.151
EXEMPTIONS SO THAT THEY MAY

00:31:27.218 --> 00:31:28.987
CONDUCT WHAT IN ANY OTHER

00:31:29.053 --> 00:31:30.722
INDUSTRY WOULD BE CONSIDERED

00:31:30.788 --> 00:31:33.458
COMMON BUSINESS PRACTICES.

00:31:33.524 --> 00:31:35.793
SOMETIMES THOSE ANALYSIS ARE

00:31:35.860 --> 00:31:37.395
HARD TO READ FOR SOME OF THE

00:31:37.462 --> 00:31:40.231
FOLKS THAT WE WORK WITH HERE IN

00:31:40.298 --> 00:31:41.432
