MILITARY IN A NON SEGREGATED

00:25:20.886 --> 00:25:25.090
MILITARY- THAT IS NOT TRUE. FOR

00:25:25.156 --> 00:25:28.693
AFRICAN AMERICAN VETERANS- IF

00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:30.061
YOU THINK ABOUT THE TUSKEGEE

00:25:30.128 --> 00:25:31.997
AIRMEN WHO CAME IN UNDER

00:26:16.708 --> 00:26:19.644
INTENT BEHIND IT. WHAT YOU HAVE

00:26:19.711 --> 00:26:20.912
TO REMEMBER IS THAT OUR

00:26:20.979 --> 00:26:25.016
MILITARY IS SUCCESSFUL BECAUSE-

00:26:25.083 --> 00:26:27.585
THE BASIS IS UNITY WHEN YOU

00:26:27.652 --> 00:26:28.887
JOIN THE MILITARY YOU DON'T

00:26:28.954 --> 00:26:33.291

WE'RE SUCCESSFUL BECAUSE IF IN

00:26:48.039 --> 00:26:51.910
THE MILITARY. WE STARTED. KIND

00:26:51.977 --> 00:26:54.112
OF SELF DIVIDING ONE ANOTHER

00:26:54.179 --> 00:26:55.714
THE WHOLE THING FALLS APART YOU

00:26:55.780 --> 00:26:57.048
HAVE TO HAVE UNITY YOU HAVE TO

00:26:57.115 --> 00:26:58.883
HAVE PEOPLE WHO COME INTO AN

00:26:58.950 --> 00:27:00.251
ORGANISATION UNDERSTANDING THAT

00:27:00.318 --> 00:27:01.753
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT YOUR

00:27:01.820 --> 00:27:03.021
RACE IS OR WHERE YOU CAME FROM

00:27:03.088 --> 00:27:04.656
THAT YOU'RE ALL WORKING TOWARD.

00:27:04.723 --> 00:27:07.025

00:27:08.727 --> 00:27:10.195
IN VIEW THEIR SERVICE.

00:27:10.261 --> 00:27:11.596
DIFFERENTLY THAN THEIR

00:27:11.663 --> 00:27:14.599
COUNTERPARTS IN THEIR PEERS. IT

00:27:14.666 --> 00:27:16.368
MAKES THE JOB MORE DIFFICULT

00:27:16.434 --> 00:27:17.969
AND THE ONE THING THAT OUR

00:27:18.036 --> 00:27:19.938
NATIONAL SECURITY DEPENDS ON IS

00:27:20.005 --> 00:27:21.973
THAT WE HAVE A MILITARY THAT IS

00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:24.109
UNITED NOT ONLY YOU KNOW

00:27:24.175 --> 00:27:26.144
PHYSICALLY GEOGRAPHICALLY BUT

00:27:26.211 --> 00:27:28.446
PSYCHOLOGICALLY. IN THIS

00:27:28.513 --> 00:27:31.783
RESOLUTION THOUGH IT DOESN'T.

00:27:31.850 --> 00:27:34.419
PHYSICALLY SEGREGATE OUR TROOPS

00:27:34.486 --> 00:27:35.520
IT IS A PSYCHOLOGICAL

00:27:35.587 --> 00:27:37.122
SEGREGATION WHEN YOU START TO

00:27:37.188 --> 00:27:38.556
TELL ONE GROUP THAT THEIR

00:27:38.623 --> 00:27:39.891
SERVICE IS SO MUCH MORE

00:27:39.958 --> 00:27:41.993
SIGNIFICANT THAN THOSE OF THE

00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:44.129
OTHERS THAT THEY GET A SEPARATE

00:27:44.195 --> 00:27:46.164
DAY AND I THINK THAT IS NOT THE

00:27:46.231 --> 00:27:47.899
MESSAGE THAT WE WANT TO SEND.

00:27:47.966 --> 00:27:49.034
I'M CERTAIN THAT THAT'S NOT THE

00:27:49.100 --> 00:27:50.902
AUTHOR'S INTENT. BUT I THINK

00:27:50.969 --> 00:27:52.037
ULTIMATELY THAT IS THE

00:27:52.103 --> 00:27:54.005
CONSEQUENCE OF PUTTING FORWARD

00:27:54.072 --> 00:27:55.607
A RESOLUTION LIKE THIS SO WITH

00:27:55.673 --> 00:27:56.875
ALL DUE RESPECT TO THE AUTHOR I

00:27:56.941 --> 00:27:58.610
MUST OPPOSE THIS RESOLUTION

00:27:58.676 --> 00:28:00.211
THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH

00:28:00.278 --> 00:28:02.047
SENATOR MELINDA'S SENATOR

00:28:02.113 --> 00:28:05.550
AIKMAN. I THANK YOU MADAM

00:28:05.617 --> 00:28:07.552

00:28:07.619 --> 00:28:09.187
THIS RESOLUTION. AND YOU KNOW

00:28:09.254 --> 00:28:11.189
AS A AS A LATINA AS A WOMAN AS

00:28:11.256 --> 00:28:13.892
A VETERAN- I CAN BE ALL OF

00:28:13.958 --> 00:28:15.160
THOSE THINGS AND STILL BE A

00:28:15.226 --> 00:28:16.728
PROUD AMERICAN AS I AM AND A

00:28:16.795 --> 00:28:18.463
PROUD VETERAN. BUT YOU KNOW IT

00:28:18.530 --> 00:28:21.199
IS NOT HARD FOR ME TO STAND FOR

00:28:21.266 --> 00:28:22.400
VETERANS ON VETERANS DAY AND I

00:28:22.467 --> 00:28:24.269
DO THAT. AND IT'S NOT HARD FOR

00:28:24.335 --> 00:28:25.503
ME TO STAND FOR LATINOS ON THE

00:28:25.570 --> 00:28:27.205
TUESDAY AND I DIDN'T DO THAT

00:28:27.272 --> 00:28:28.640
AND FOR WOMEN'S DAY. AND I

00:28:28.706 --> 00:28:30.208
THINK WHEN WE TALK ABOUT ISSUES

00:28:30.275 --> 00:28:31.709
LIKE UNITY WE CAN LOOK AROUND

00:28:31.776 --> 00:28:33.711
AND I CAN NO THE GENERAL ROSS

00:28:33.778 --> 00:28:35.313
WOULD STAND FOR ME. AND I CAN

00:28:35.380 --> 00:28:36.781
LOOK AROUND I CAN KNOW THAT

00:28:36.848 --> 00:28:37.882
CAPTAIN NEWMAN WOULD STAND FOR

00:28:37.949 --> 00:28:39.417
ME. I CAN LOOK AROUND I KNOW

00:28:39.484 --> 00:28:41.152
THAT BECAUSE I KNOW I WOULD

00:28:41.219 --> 00:28:42.287
STAND WITH THEM AND THEY KNOW

00:28:42.353 --> 00:28:44.556
THAT. AND I THINK A LOT OF

00:28:44.622 --> 00:28:45.857
TIMES WHEN WE- PEOPLE TRY TO

00:28:45.924 --> 00:28:47.058
SAY WE'RE SEGREGATING OURSELVES

00:28:47.125 --> 00:28:48.460
WE'RE RECOGNIZING. I THINK IN

00:28:48.526 --> 00:28:50.728
RECOGNIZING THAT. PEOPLE HAVE A

00:28:50.795 --> 00:28:53.531
LOT OF PRIDE. IN FAMILY MEMBERS

00:28:53.598 --> 00:28:55.533
AND SERVICE. A LOT OF PRIDE IN

00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:57.035
THEIR CULTURE AND WHEN THOSE

00:28:57.102 --> 00:28:58.103
TWO THINGS ARE. ARE MELDED

00:28:58.169 --> 00:29:00.071
TOGETHER. I KNOW FROM Y FAMILY

00:29:00.138 --> 00:29:01.706
WHO CAME OVER AS IMMIGRANTS AND

00:29:01.773 --> 00:29:03.741
PROUDLY SERVED. AND MY FAMILY

00:29:03.808 --> 00:29:05.376
UP UP. WITH THE PICTURES OF OUR

00:29:05.443 --> 00:29:07.679
LADY WAR LUPE AND THE POPE- AND

00:29:07.745 --> 00:29:09.514
JFK WAS ALSO MY UNCLES. IN

00:29:09.581 --> 00:29:11.583
PROUDLY IN THEIR UNIFORMS. AND

00:29:11.649 --> 00:29:12.684
IT WAS A REAL THING OF HONOR IN

00:29:12.750 --> 00:29:13.785
MY FAMILY AND WHEN I WENT TO

00:29:13.852 --> 00:29:15.253
THE MILITARY. IT WAS A THING OF

00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:17.055
HONOR FOR ME AS WELL. SO WHERE

00:29:17.122 --> 00:29:19.357
WE STAND AS AMERICANS WE STAND

00:29:19.424 --> 00:29:20.492
FOR ALL OF US. RIGHT WHEN WE

00:29:20.558 --> 00:29:23.228
STAND IN UNITY WE STAND NOT TO.

00:29:23.294 --> 00:29:24.996
DIVIDE AND IT JUST FEELS A-

00:29:25.063 --> 00:29:26.464
BOMB. AT THAT I AM PROUD TO

00:29:26.531 --> 00:29:27.432
STAND WITH THAT CENTER

00:29:27.499 --> 00:29:29.100
ARCHULETA TODAY AND I'M PROUD

00:29:29.167 --> 00:29:30.435
TO STAND WITH ANYBODY. WHO HAS

00:29:30.502 --> 00:29:34.072
SERVED THIS COUNTRY. AND

00:29:34.139 --> 00:29:34.572
DESERVES A LITTLE BIT OF

00:29:34.639 --> 00:29:35.306

THANK YOU VERY MUCH YOU KNOW I

00:29:46.651 --> 00:29:48.753
JUST WANTED TO RISE TO ADDRESS

00:29:48.820 --> 00:29:50.188
SOME OF THE COMMENTS WERE MADE

00:29:50.255 --> 00:29:53.024
ABOUT BEING INCLUDED IN THE MID

00:29:53.091 --> 00:29:54.626
IN MILITARY SERVICE AND NOT

00:29:54.692 --> 00:29:57.529
SEGREGATED I THINK THAT REALLY

00:29:57.595 --> 00:29:59.397
DOES NOT DO SERVICE TO WHAT

00:29:59.464 --> 00:30:00.732
REALLY HAS HAPPENED IN OUR

00:30:00.798 --> 00:30:03.635
NATION'S HISTORY DESPITE. OF

00:30:03.701 --> 00:30:07.038
THE- HISPANICS AND LATINOS

00:30:07.105 --> 00:30:10.208
SERVING. IN IN MILITARY IN THE

00:30:10.275 --> 00:30:12.443
MILITARY AND BEING INTEGRATED

00:30:12.510 --> 00:30:13.144
THIRTY EIGHT THEY SUFFERED

00:30:13.211 --> 00:30:15.280
ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF RACISM. IN

00:30:15.346 --> 00:30:17.015
THE HISTORY OF AMERICA

00:30:17.081 --> 00:30:19.751
INCLUDING BEING PASSED UP FOR

00:30:19.817 --> 00:30:21.686
IMPORTANT METALS AND PROMOTIONS

00:30:21.753 --> 00:30:24.756
RIGHT NOW THE LARGEST GROWING

00:30:24.822 --> 00:30:27.759
ETHNIC GROUP IN THE MILITARY

00:30:27.825 --> 00:30:28.826
ARE ARE LATINOS AND LATINO

00:30:28.893 --> 00:30:31.429
ORIGIN. YET THEY ARE NOT

00:30:31.496 --> 00:30:34.566
ACHIEVING RANK AT THE SAME

00:30:34.632 --> 00:30:37.769
LEVEL AS OTHER ETHNIC GROUPS

00:30:37.835 --> 00:30:39.637
AND THAT CALLS INTO QUESTION IN

00:30:39.704 --> 00:30:41.739
TERMS OF HOW. OUR MILITARY IS

00:30:41.806 --> 00:30:45.009
BEING RUN. AND WHETHER LATINOS

00:30:45.076 --> 00:30:47.045
ARE GIVING- ARE BEING GIVEN A

00:30:47.111 --> 00:30:49.347
FAIR OPPORTUNITY TO SERVE IN

00:30:49.414 --> 00:30:51.382
POSITIONS OF RANK IN POSITIONS

00:30:51.449 --> 00:30:54.152
OF LEADERSHIP. IN OUR MILITARY

00:30:54.219 --> 00:30:56.254
WE KNOW THAT THAT HAS HAPPENED.

00:30:56.321 --> 00:30:58.156
HISTORICALLY AND WE NEED TO

00:30:58.223 --> 00:31:01.326
RAISE AWARENESS THAT THAT IS

00:31:01.392 --> 00:31:02.927
HAS HAPPENED AND THAT IT

00:31:02.994 --> 00:31:06.731
CONTINUES TO HAPPEN WITHIN THE

00:31:06.798 --> 00:31:07.665
RANKS OF OUR MILITARY. BUT

00:31:07.732 --> 00:31:09.601
THERE'S A DIFFERENT STORY TO BE

00:31:09.667 --> 00:31:12.270
TOLD ABOUT LATINO SERVING IN IN

00:31:12.337 --> 00:31:14.105
IN THE MILITARY THERE'S A VERY

00:31:14.172 --> 00:31:16.007
IMPORTANT STORY TO BE TOLD

00:31:16.074 --> 00:31:17.842
ABOUT NATIVE AMERICANS AND

00:31:17.909 --> 00:31:19.644
AFRICAN AMERICANS AND ASIAN

00:31:19.711 --> 00:31:21.579
AMERICANS ALL OF THEM HAVE

00:31:21.646 --> 00:31:25.383
PROVIDED. A UNIQUE ADVANTAGE IN

00:31:25.450 --> 00:31:28.720
THE AREA OF IN IT INTERNATIONAL

00:31:28.786 --> 00:31:32.624
CAMP- CAMPAIGNS ARE TO KEEP OUR

00:31:32.690 --> 00:31:34.692

MILITARY MIGHT AND POWER. AND

00:31:40.298 --> 00:31:43.067
I'M NOT AFRAID OF US

00:31:43.134 --> 00:31:44.802
UNDERSTANDING THAT IF THERE IS

00:31:44.869 --> 00:31:45.637
A STORY TO BE TOLD AND YOU

00:31:45.703 --> 00:31:47.171
SHOULD BE TOLD. AND WE

00:31:47.238 --> 00:31:49.907
SHOULDN'T BE AFRAID OF THAT

00:31:49.974 --> 00:31:53.678
STORY. ON UNITING US THAT'S NOT

00:31:53.745 --> 00:31:54.979
THE POINT THE POINT IS TO

00:31:55.046 --> 00:31:58.149
RAISE. AWARENESS ABOUT LATINOS

00:31:58.216 --> 00:32:01.653
HAVING HAD CONTRIBUTED. TO

00:32:01.719 --> 00:32:03.788
MAKING THIS COUNTRY GREAT DON'T

00:32:03.855 --> 00:32:07.058
BE AFRAID OF RECOGNIZING THE

00:32:07.125 --> 00:32:09.727
CONTRIBUTION THAT. LATINOS HAVE

00:32:09.794 --> 00:32:11.329
MADE AND DON'T BE AFRAID OF

CONTRIBUTION THAT EVERYONE HAS

00:32:14.766 --> 00:32:17.568
MADE. AND THIS IS NOT AN EFFORT

00:32:17.635 --> 00:32:19.604
TO DENY BUT TO TELL THE STORY

00:32:19.671 --> 00:32:21.906
AND TO REALLY LOOK AT A GROUP

00:32:21.973 --> 00:32:24.742
THAT. HAS DISTINGUISHES ITSELF

00:32:24.809 --> 00:32:27.111
FROM MILITARY SERVICE TODAY IN

VALOR HAVE BEEN LATINOS EVEN IF

00:32:37.255 --> 00:32:39.390
THEY WERE PASSED OVER FOR

00:32:39.457 --> 00:32:41.559
IMPORTANT RECOGNITIONS THEY

00:42:28.679 --> 00:42:30.180
RELATIONSHIPS I'M NOT SURE WHAT

00:42:30.247 --> 00:42:31.982
THAT MEANS AS WELL. TECHNOLOGY

00:42:32.049 --> 00:42:33.951
SAVINGS FOR UNPROVEN THINGS

00:42:34.018 --> 00:42:36.020
LIKE LARGE BATTERY STORAGE. SO

00:42:36.086 --> 00:42:37.288
THERE'S GOING TO BE A COST TO

00:42:37.354 --> 00:42:39.490
THE RATE PAYERS AND- AS I'VE

00:42:39.556 --> 00:42:40.624
SAID MANY TIMES ON THIS FLOOR

00:42:40.691 --> 00:42:42.026
THAT THE DEVIL'S IN THE DETAILS

00:42:42.092 --> 00:42:43.694
AND HOW WE'RE GOING TO ACHIEVE

00:42:43.761 --> 00:42:46.730
ZERO. EMISSIONS BY TWENTY

00:42:46.797 --> 00:42:48.198
THIRTY WAS **** IS GOING TO BE

00:42:48.265 --> 00:42:49.633
A HUGE IMPACT ON THE RATE

00:42:49.700 --> 00:42:51.135
PAYERS AND THIS IS A PLAN

00:42:51.201 --> 00:42:52.503
THAT'S NOT VERY WELL THOUGHT

00:42:52.569 --> 00:42:54.638
THOUGHT OUT IN MY OPINION SO.

00:42:54.705 --> 00:42:56.340
THE ONE THING WE CAN WE CAN

00:42:56.407 --> 00:42:58.208
COUNT ON IS THAT. THE RATE

00:42:58.275 --> 00:42:59.276
PAYERS WILL BE ON THE HOOK AT

00:42:59.343 --> 00:43:00.644
THE END. AND WE DIDN'T KNOW

00:43:00.711 --> 00:43:01.912
THAT BUT BEFORE GOING INTO IT

00:43:01.979 --> 00:43:03.480
SO FOR THOSE REASONS. I OPPOSE

00:43:03.547 --> 00:43:06.684
S. C. R. FIFTY ONE. THANK YOU

00:43:06.750 --> 00:43:09.520

THANK YOU I RISE IN SUPPORT OF

00:43:10.254 --> 00:43:11.956
THIS RESOLUTION. IN THE GLOBAL

00:43:12.022 --> 00:43:13.724
FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE WE

00:43:13.791 --> 00:43:15.159
NEED MODELS. AND THAT'S WHAT WE

00:43:15.225 --> 00:43:16.560
DO HERE IN CALIFORNIA IS SO

00:43:16.627 --> 00:43:17.661
IMPORTANT. WHAT WE DO ON

00:43:17.728 --> 00:43:19.463
TRANSPORTATION WHAT WE DO ON

00:43:19.530 --> 00:43:22.166
THE GRID. BUT WHAT WE DO ON-

00:43:22.232 --> 00:43:23.467
THE BUILDINGS WILL BE DO YOU ON

00:43:23.534 --> 00:43:25.069
CEMENT. WE COULDN'T CREATE

00:43:25.135 --> 00:43:26.303
MODELS FOR THE REST OF THE

00:43:26.370 --> 00:43:28.739
COUNTRY. AND IN MANY CASES REST

00:43:28.806 --> 00:43:29.673
THE WORLD SO I JUST WANNA

00:43:29.740 --> 00:43:31.608
COMMAND. THE AUTHOR ADMIN

00:43:31.675 --> 00:43:33.243
COMMANDS BUT THE SURGE THIS

00:43:33.310 --> 00:43:36.947
MONTH IS A TREMENDOUS. GOAL TO

00:43:37.014 --> 00:43:38.882
BE ZERO CARBON BY TWENTY THIRTY.

00:43:38.949 --> 00:43:40.150
AND HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN THIS

00:43:40.217 --> 00:43:42.152
KIND OF POLICY FOR A LONG TIME.

00:43:42.219 --> 00:43:43.053
THE CLEAR MARKET PLACE

00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:44.989
CONFERENCE WE START FOR EPA

00:43:45.055 --> 00:43:46.156
NINETEEN NINETY ONE. WE ALWAYS

00:43:46.223 --> 00:43:47.091
KNEW AT THE TIME THAT THE

00:43:47.157 --> 00:43:49.460
TECHNOLOGY. WASN'T POSSIBLE AT

00:43:49.526 --> 00:43:52.763
THAT TIME TO GET. TO ZERO BUT

00:43:52.830 --> 00:43:53.731
NOW WE KNOW THE TECHNOLOGY IS

00:43:53.797 --> 00:43:55.899
THERE. BUT WE HAVE. THE

00:43:55.966 --> 00:43:58.302
CAPACITY WITH RENEWABLES WITH

00:43:58.369 --> 00:43:59.636
YOUR THERMAL WITH OFFSHORE

00:43:59.703 --> 00:44:02.239
WIND. WITH ALL THE OTHER NEW

00:44:02.306 --> 00:44:03.807
TECHNOLOGY COMING ONLINE WE

00:44:03.874 --> 00:44:05.342
KNOW WE CAN GET THERE WE KNOW

00:44:05.409 --> 00:44:07.277
WE CAN ACHIEVE. THIS YOUR CAR

00:44:07.344 --> 00:44:09.013
BY TWENTY THIRTY GOAL IS VERY

00:44:09.079 --> 00:44:11.582
IMPORTANT. AND I. HAVE HAPPY TO

00:44:11.648 --> 00:44:13.484

THANK YOU SENATOR BAKER MEMBERS

00:44:15.319 --> 00:44:17.788
FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE.

00:44:17.855 --> 00:44:20.257
CENTER GROVE. AND PRESIDENT I

00:44:20.324 --> 00:44:21.225
TOO HAVE TO AGREE WITH MY

00:44:21.291 --> 00:44:22.659
COLLEAGUE FROM BEAVER THAT THAT

00:44:22.726 --> 00:44:24.628
YOU KNOW THE DETAILS- WHAT'S

00:44:24.695 --> 00:44:26.497
VERY IMPORTANT ABOUT THIS. BUT

00:44:26.563 --> 00:44:27.464
I ALSO AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE

00:44:27.531 --> 00:44:29.500
FROM SILICON VALLEY. AND HE

00:44:29.566 --> 00:44:30.768
SAYS THAT YOU KNOW EVERYTHING

00:44:30.834 --> 00:44:32.269
THAT WE DO OUT THERE MAKES A

00:44:32.336 --> 00:44:33.570
HUGE DIFFERENCE AND ONE OF THE

00:44:33.637 --> 00:44:34.872
THINGS I'M GONNA CONTINUE TO

00:44:34.938 --> 00:44:37.174
SAY THIS BODY IS THAT. MY

00:44:37.241 --> 00:44:40.911
DISTRICT PRODUCES 53% OF ALL

00:44:40.978 --> 00:44:42.713
SOLAR ENERGY RENEWABLE ENERGY

00:44:42.780 --> 00:44:45.082
TO THE GRID AND SO WHILE MY

00:44:45.149 --> 00:44:46.350
DISTRICT IS BUILDING LARGE

00:44:46.417 --> 00:44:47.785
SCALE SOLAR PLANTS WITH NO TAX

00:44:47.851 --> 00:44:49.019
BENEFITS IS A MATTER OF FACT

00:44:49.086 --> 00:44:50.254
WE'VE LOST A HUNDRED AND THREE

00:44:50.320 --> 00:44:52.489
MILLION DOLLARS. WE DON'T HAVE

00:44:52.556 --> 00:44:54.358
THE RESOURCES FOR FIREFIGHTERS

00:44:54.425 --> 00:44:56.693
LAW ENFORCEMENT- ALL OF THOSE

00:44:56.760 --> 00:44:57.995
THINGS IT DOES MAKE A

00:44:58.062 --> 00:44:59.496
DIFFERENCE ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS

00:44:59.563 --> 00:45:01.131
SO WHAT WE SEND OUR ENERGY

00:45:01.198 --> 00:45:03.167
SOLAR ENERGY NORTH. POSSIBLY

00:45:03.233 --> 00:45:04.301
THIS MAN I'M TRYING TO GET A

00:45:04.368 --> 00:45:05.502
TEXT BACK IMMEDIATELY BUT I

00:45:05.569 --> 00:45:06.637
KNOW IT DOES GO TO SACRAMENTO

00:45:06.703 --> 00:45:08.038
WHEN IT DOES GO TO SAN

00:45:08.105 --> 00:45:08.639
FRANCISCO WHEN IT DOES GO TO

00:45:08.705 --> 00:45:10.374
LOS ANGELES. AS A MATTER OF

00:45:10.441 --> 00:45:11.642
FACT LOS ANGELES PUTS THEIR

00:45:11.708 --> 00:45:13.510
COMMERCIALS UP ON TV AND

00:45:13.577 --> 00:45:15.612
THEY'RE USING OUR SOLAR. LARGE

00:45:15.679 --> 00:45:17.815
SCALE SOLAR FACILITIES M.

00:45:17.881 --> 00:45:19.917
PLANTS- IN KERN COUNTY IN PART

00:45:19.983 --> 00:45:22.453
OF THEIR- ADVERTISING THIS IS

00:45:22.519 --> 00:45:23.620
THAT WE'VE GOT THEM ON A GREEN

00:45:23.687 --> 00:45:25.956
TECHNOLOGY. NOT BELIEVE THAT'S

00:45:26.023 --> 00:45:27.491
THAT LOS ANGELES IS ON A GREEN

00:45:27.558 --> 00:45:29.493
TECHNOLOGY A PLATFORM. WELL

00:45:29.560 --> 00:45:30.794
THAT ENERGY IS COMING FROM KERN

00:45:30.861 --> 00:45:33.063
COUNTY SO- YOU KNOW WHEN I

00:45:33.130 --> 00:45:34.031
DON'T SEE SOLAR PLANTS IN

00:45:34.098 --> 00:45:35.332
INGLEWOOD AND I DON'T SEE SOLAR

00:45:35.399 --> 00:45:36.834
PLANTS IN SACRAMENTO AND I

00:45:36.900 --> 00:45:38.869
DON'T SEE LARGE SCALE SOLAR IN

00:45:38.936 --> 00:45:39.603
ANY OTHER REALLY PARTS OF THE

00:45:39.670 --> 00:45:41.638
STATE- I JUST YOU KNOW THINK

00:45:41.705 --> 00:45:42.673
THAT YOU GUYS NEED TO

00:45:42.739 --> 00:45:44.007
UNDERSTAND THAT. AND WE'RE IN

00:45:44.074 --> 00:45:45.309
THE PROCESS AGAIN OF APPROVING

00:45:45.375 --> 00:45:46.977
A SIX THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED

00:45:47.044 --> 00:45:49.713
MEGAWATT POWER PLANT. AND I'M

00:45:49.780 --> 00:45:51.281
ASKING MY COUNTY BOARD OF

00:45:51.348 --> 00:45:52.116
SUPERVISORS NOT TO APPROVE THAT

00:45:52.182 --> 00:45:54.351
PLAN. DON'T APPROVE IT IF WE'RE

00:45:54.418 --> 00:45:55.586
NOT GONNA GET ANY BENEFITS OUT

00:45:55.652 --> 00:45:56.653
OF IT WHATSOEVER AND IT'S GONNA

00:45:56.720 --> 00:45:58.122
DO NOTHING BUT A CHIEF OF THE

00:45:58.188 --> 00:45:59.456
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION GOALS

00:45:59.523 --> 00:46:00.757
THAT ARE BY THIS GOVERNOR IN

00:46:00.824 --> 00:46:03.260
THIS. MAJORITY BODY THAT- WE

00:46:03.327 --> 00:46:04.561
SHOULD HOLD OUT YOU KNOW HOLD

00:46:04.628 --> 00:46:05.963
TIGHT WE HAVE TAKEN THE HIGH

00:46:06.029 --> 00:46:07.631
ROAD WE HAVE TAKEN THE HIGH

00:46:07.698 --> 00:46:10.267
ROAD AND- WE HAVE PRODUCED 53%

00:46:10.334 --> 00:46:11.268
OF THE STATE'S RENEWABLE

00:46:11.335 --> 00:46:13.937
ENERGY. AND WE GET ZERO CREDIT

00:46:14.004 --> 00:46:15.172
FOR IT WHATSOEVER AND THEN WE

00:46:15.239 --> 00:46:19.109
PRODUCE 70% OF THE STATE'S OIL

00:46:19.176 --> 00:46:19.710
AND WE GET ATTACKED ON THAT ON

00:46:19.776 --> 00:46:20.344
A DAILY BASIS. SO MAKING SURE

00:46:20.410 --> 00:46:21.145
THAT CALIFORNIA BEACHES

00:46:21.211 --> 00:46:22.813
RENEWABLE ENERGY GOALS BY THE

00:46:22.880 --> 00:46:24.848
DATE THAT THIS. RESOLUTION IS

00:46:24.915 --> 00:46:26.617
SET THAT'S MADE HIS AGREED TO.

00:46:26.683 --> 00:46:28.051
A KERN COUNTY IS A BIG PART OF

00:46:28.118 --> 00:46:28.919
THAT AND I THINK WE SHOULD

00:46:28.986 --> 00:46:30.888
TALK. BECAUSE I THINK IT'S VERY

00:46:30.954 --> 00:46:33.023
IMPORTANT TO THAT- THE NEXT

00:46:33.090 --> 00:46:34.958
SOLAR PLANT IT'S POSSIBLY A

00:46:35.025 --> 00:46:37.227
HOPEFULLY NOT APPROVED. IN THE

00:46:37.294 --> 00:46:38.295
NEAR FUTURE THAT WE HOLD OFF ON

00:46:38.362 --> 00:46:41.131
IT- IS UP FIVE TIMES THE SIZE

00:46:41.198 --> 00:46:42.432
OF DISNEYLAND IT WILL PRODUCE

00:46:42.499 --> 00:46:44.067
ANOTHER SIX THOUSAND FIVE

00:46:44.134 --> 00:46:45.102
HUNDRED MEGAWATTS OF POWER.

00:46:45.169 --> 00:46:46.837
GREEN ENERGY. TO THE STATE OF

00:46:46.904 --> 00:46:48.438

WOULD ALSO MAKE NOTE THAT-

00:47:13.630 --> 00:47:14.698
ACTUALLY POWER HERE IN

00:47:14.765 --> 00:47:16.400
SACRAMENTO IS LESS EXPENSIVE

00:47:16.466 --> 00:47:17.668
THAN MANY OF THE SURROUNDING

00:47:17.734 --> 00:47:19.503
AREAS- BECAUSE I DO HAVE PARTS

00:47:19.570 --> 00:47:21.471
OF MY DISTRICT AREN'T. COVERED

00:47:21.538 --> 00:47:23.507
