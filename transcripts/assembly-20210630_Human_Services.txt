ACTUALLY GREAT WE HAVE OUR OUR FIRST PRESENTER SENATOR TORONTO WELCOME SENATOR TORONTO. YES SENATOR PLEASE GO HEAD WHENEVER YOU'RE READY AND THREE FOR THIRTY NINE SIX SB SIX THIRTY NINE THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH MA'AM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE VERY MUCH FOR WORKING WITH US ON. THEIR ANALYSIS AND THAT I ACCEPT THE TECHNICAL AMENDMENT ON PAGE TEN- SB SIX THIRTY NINE ENSURES THAT WORKERS WITH DISABILITIES CANNOT BE PAID LESS THAN MINIMUM WAGE. SINCE THE THIRD NINETEEN THIRTIES THE STATE HAS BEEN ABLE TO PAY WORKERS WITH DISABILITIES LESS THAN MINIMUM WAGE THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF FOURTEEN C. CERTIFICATES. UNDER THE FEDERAL FAIR LABOR STANDARDS ACT. SO EVEN THIS CALIFORNIA PRIDES ITSELF IN LEADING THE COUNTRY WITH OUR MINIMUM WAGE A WORKER PROTECTIONS THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS WITH DISABILITIES ARE STILL BEING- ARE STILL WORKING IN SEGREGATED SETTINGS OFTEN. FOR LESS THAN TWO DOLLARS AN HOUR. SB SIX THIRTY NINE PROHIBITS THE ISSUANCE OF NEW. FORTY C. CERTIFICATES BY JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY TWO. AND DEVELOPED A PHASE OUT PLAN FOR CURRENT EMPLOYERS TO ENSURE A PATH TO COMPETITIVE INTEGRATED EMPLOYMENT. I TWENTY TWENTY FIVE THIS BILL WILL END THE PRACTICE OF SEGREGATED SOME MINIMUM WAGE EMPLOYMENT ENTIRELY. THIS PRACTICE IS AN ARCHAIC RELIC OF THE NINETEEN THIRTIES AND DATES BACK TO A TIME WHEN CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES WERE DENIED AN EDUCATION. AND BEFORE CIVIL RIGHTS LEGISLATION SUCH AS THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT RECOGNIZE THE FULL HUMANITY OF PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES. IF ENACTED CALIFORNIA WILL JOIN THE STATES OF ALASKA CONNECTICUT MARYLAND NEW HAMPSHIRE NEW YORK RHODE ISLAND. TEXAS AND WASHINGTON IN PROHIBITING SUB MINIMUM WAGE EMPLOYMENT OR SHELTERED WORKSHOPS I ALSO WANT TO ADD THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS INVESTING HEAVILY IN PROGRAMS THAT WILL SUPPORT THE SUCCESSFUL TRANSITION OF INDIVIDUALS MOVING OUT. OF SHELTERED WORKSHOPS WE ARE PROVIDING FOR EXAMPLE AN ADDITIONAL SIXTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS FOR REGIONAL CENTER SERVICE COORDINATORS WILL BE ASSISTING INDIVIDUALS MOVING OUT OF SHELTERED WORKSHOPS WE ARE ALSO INVESTING IN COMPETITIVE INTEGRATED EMPLOYMENT. BY NEW INITIATIVES SUCH AS DOUBLING THE INCENTIVE PAYMENTS TO SERVICE PROVIDERS REPLACING AN INDIVIDUAL INTO COMPETITIVE INTEGRATED EMPLOYMENT IF THE INDIVIDUAL MAINTAINS EMPLOYMENT FOR SPECIFIED MILESTONES WE WANT EVERY PERSON COMING OUT OF A SHELTERED WORKSHOP. TO HAVE A MEANINGFUL DAY AND THE MEANINGFUL EXPERIENCES AND THIS BUDGET INVESTS HEAVILY TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN. I HAVE TWO WITNESSES JOINING ME TODAY ERIN CARUTHERS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE STATE COUNCIL ON DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. WILL BE TESTIFYING IN PERSON AND KEN BARNES PRESIDENT AND C. E. O. OF OPTIONS FOR ALL. TWENTY MANAGER. THANK YOU CENTER TORONTO- L. YOUR FIRST WITH FIRST WITNESS CAN GO AHEAD AND BEGIN THAT PACKAGE AARON THANK YOU FOR THE HARD WORK OF EUROPE COMMITTEE AND HOLDS MY PHONE IS STILL THE MAN CHRIS WARD MY NAME IS KEN BARNES AND I'M THE PRESIDENCY OF OPTIONS FOR ALL WARY SAN DIEGO BASED SERVICE PROVIDER WITH OFFICES IN INLAND EMPIRE AND SILICON VALLEY AND WE PROVIDE SUPPORT SERVICES FOR OVER THIRTEEN HUNDRED INDIVIDUALS WITH INTELLECTUAL. AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES WE SUPPORT SB SIX THIRTY NINE BECAUSE WE KNOW IT'S POSSIBLE THE TRANSITION OR DIVERSE PERSONS FROM SUB MINIMUM WAGE- TO MARKET RATE JOBS AND WHILE SOME FAMILY MEMBERS SEE THESE JOBS VALUABLE OPPORTUNITIES FOR TRAINING AND SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT WHAT I DISCOVERED AFTER BECOMING CEO LAST YEAR THAT THESE FOURTEEN C. CERTIFICATES OFTEN TOOLS FOR EMPLOYERS TO LEGALLY EXPLOIT THE LABOR OF PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES SO I PAN FOURTEEN C. CERTIFICATES AND THAT'S SUPPORTABLE. FINDING COMPETITIVE INTEGRATED EMPLOYMENT IS NOT EASY BUT SINCE WE BAN FOURTEEN C. CERTIFIED- FOURTEEN C. SUPPORT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO PLACE OVER ONE HUNDRED FIFTY PEOPLE IN THE MARKET RATE JOBS AND IT'S DURING A PANDEMIC. HOW INSTEAD OF BACKING EMPLOYERS TO HIRE PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES WE TELL POTENTIAL EMPLOYERS ABOUT THE BENEFITS OF HAVING A PHENOMENAL EMPLOYEE AND THE RESPONSE HAS BEEN EXCELLENT OPPONENTS OF SB SIX THIRTY NINE OFTEN CITE THE HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT RATE OF THOSE WITH DISABILITIES AS A REASON TO MAINTAIN FOURTEEN C. CERTIFICATES HOWEVER EVEN WITH THE ABOMINATION OF SUB MINIMUM WAGE PAYMENTS. FALLING BELOW TWO DOLLARS AN HOUR IN SOME CASES UNEMPLOYMENT RATES CONTINUE TO BE STRATOSPHERIC THIS MEANS THE ISSUE IS ACCEPTANCE AND INCLUSIVITY. AND NOT ONE DRIVEN BY ECONOMICS. IN CLOSING I THINK. MY AREAS IN COLLEGE HUMAN RIGHTS AND THAT'S WHY I GET A LITTLE EMOTIONAL ABOUT THIS AND- I FELL STUDENT OUT WHAT'S THAT'S A PROFESSOR. HOW TO DEFINE A HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATION AND HE SAYS I KNOW IT WHEN I SEE IT. YEAH AND LAST YEAR WHEN I LEARNED IT WAS LEGAL IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE PAY PEOPLE VOTERS THREE OR FOUR DOLLARS AN HOUR. I KNEW INSTANTLY IT WAS A HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATION I HOPE YOU SEE THAT THE C. ABOUT WAYS WELL AND ASK FOR YOUR VOTE OF YES ON SB SIX THIRTY NINE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR ERIN CARUTHERS AND THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE STATE COUNCIL ON DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES WE ARE AN INDEPENDENT STATE ENTITY THAT IS HERE TO BE A GUIDING FORCE FOR POSITIVE LASTING CHANGES IN LIFE TO PEOPLE DEVELOP DISABILITIES THEIR FAMILIES WHICH IS WHY WE'RE ONE OF THE CO SPONSORS OF THIS LEGISLATION. ONE THIRD OF OUR COUNCIL MEMBERS WERE ACTUALLY PUT INTO SAID MINIMUM WAGE SHELTERED WORKSHOPS. AND THEY ALL QUIT- ONE IN PARTICULAR- SAID THAT SHE WAS. PUT IN THERE AND WHEN SHE FOUND IT WAS ABOUT SHE LEFT AND SHE WENT TO A COOKING CLASS WHICH IS REALLY WHAT HER PASSION WAS. ANOTHER ONE SAID THAT SHE REPORTS ABUSES IS SHE EXPERIENCING THEM NOT BEING ABLE TO USE THE RESTROOM. IN THE END SHE JUST SAID. IT'S NOT WORTH IT FOR THE MONEY THEY'RE GIVING ME. AND THEN A THIRD ACTUALLY STAGED A LABOR WALK OUT TO TRY TO GET BETTER RATES. GET BETTER WAGES. THIS LEGISLATION WILL DO WHAT THESEADVOCATES WE'RE NOT ABLE TO DO ON THEIR OWN. WHICH IS TO STOP AN UNFAIR EXPLOITATIVE PRACTICE. THIS COMMUNITY AND THIS COMMITTEE I'M SORRY IS THE CHAMPION OF THE LANCER MAX AND WE'RE GRATEFUL FOR THAT. AT ITS CORE THE LANTERN ACT IS A CIVIL RIGHTS BLUEPRINT IT'S FOR A CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT. IN ALL COMPASSION AT ONE POINT IN OUR HISTORY SHELTERED WORKSHOPS SUB MINIMUM WAGE THAT WAS SEEN AS THE BEST MOST PROGRESSIVE THING THAT YOU COULD DO FOR PEOPLE WITH INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. BUT TIMES HAVE CHANGED AND OUR VIEWS HAVE CHANGED AND ACTUALLY OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO PEOPLE HAVE CHANGED MS OUR COUNCIL SO DEEPLY GRATEFUL FOR HOW MUCH CONCERN HAS BEEN PLACED ON WHAT HAPPENS TO EACH INDIVIDUAL. IT ONCE SHELTERED WORKSHOPS ARE CLOSED. WANT TO POINT OUT THAT FOR THE LAST FIVE YEARS THE LEGISLATURE'S LAY THAT FRIEND THAT THAT GROUP THAT FROM GROUNDWORK- YOU'VE INVESTED FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR FOR PROVIDERS TO. ADAPT MODERNIZE TO CURRENT TIMES ADDITIONALLY THE SENATOR JUST POINTED OUT ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS THE LEGISLATURE IS DOING. SO THAT PEOPLE WILL BE ABLE TO MAKE THIS TRANSITION SO THIS IS THE RIGHT POLICY AT THE RIGHT TIME WITH THE RIGHT SUPPORTS. TO CREATE SUCCESSFUL PEOPLE DESERVE BETTER I'LL BE HAPPY TO ANSWER THE QUESTIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU MR CROWTHER'S. AT THIS TIME DO WE HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL SUPPORT- IN THE HEARING ROOM.

THE SORRY THAT ALLERGIES OFFICER WENT AHEAD GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF MY NAME IS CARL LONDON I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE LIONS SUPPORTING PEOPLE WITH INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOPMENT DISABILITIES WE ARE STATEWIDE ORGANIZATION OF COMMUNITY BASED NONPROFITS THAT SERVE THIS POPULATION THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA AND PROVIDE A RANGE OF SERVICES I DO WANT TO CLEAR UP A COUPLE THINGS ABOUT THIS LEGISLATION. FIRST OF ALL THIS IS A THIS WAS SAID A COUPLE TIMES IT APPLIES ONLY TO SHELTERED WORKSHOPS WORK ACTIVITY PROGRAMS IT IS NOT THERE ARE PEOPLE THROUGHOUT COMMUNITY INTEGRATED PROGRAMS TODAY THEY CHOOSE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF SUB MINIMUM WAGE PROGRAMS ARE FOURTEEN C. CERTIFICATES AND GAIN WORK EXPERIENCE IN THE COMMUNITY- MY SON IS- ONE OF THOSE MEMBERS ALL TALK A BIT MORE ABOUT THAT- THE OTHER THING IS THAT. IF YOU LOOK AT THIS BILL THIS BILL DOES NOT GET PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES WHO CURRENTLY MAKE SUB MINIMUM WAGE MINIMUM WAGE TO SIMPLY SAYS. NOBODY CAN BE PAID LESS THAN MINIMUM WAGE ANYMORE. AND GETS RID OF THE OPPORTUNITY TO USE A FEDERAL LAW WHICH IS LEGAL IN EXIST TODAY AND ALLOW SOME AND WE SHOULD BE TO BE USED. THE ONLY WAY A PERSON GETS TO A SUB MINIMUM WAGE POSITION IN CALIFORNIA JUST TO BE CLEAR ABOUT THIS. IS IF THEY PROGRAM REGISTERS FOLLOWS ALL OF THE FEDERAL GUIDELINES AND A TEEN'S A. FOURTEEN C. CERTIFICATE. SECOND THE PERSON WHO- LIKE MY SON WHO CHOOSES TO DO THIS HAS TO ELECT THAT CHOICE THROUGH THE INDIVIDUALIZED PROGRAM PLAN PROCESS. THAT IS DONE BY THE REGIONAL CENTER IN THE CATCHMENT AREA IN WHICH THEY LIVE IN OTHER WORDS THEY HAVE TO DESIGNATE AND SAY THIS IS WHAT I CHOOSE TO DO. THE LAST THING I'D SAY HER AND I WANT TO TALK ABOUT MY SON'S PERSONAL EXPERIENCE. WHAT MISTER BARNES SAYS I GET EMOTIONAL ABOUT THE SOMETIMES BUT HE'S A GUY WHO'S FUNCTIONALLY BLIND HAS BRAIN DAMAGE FROM BIRTH AND CANNOT FUNCTION AT LEAST THUS FAR AT A RATE THAT WOULD ALLOW HIM TO COMPETE IN THE REGULAR WORKFORCE JUSTICE WAS IMAGINED IN THE FEDERAL LEGISLATION. NOW HE GOT A JOB A WHILE AGO AT BEST BUY. HE WAS RESTOCKING SHELVES HE WAS TAKING EVERYTHING THAT'S RETURNED TO THE STORE AND TAKING A BATH AND PUTTING IT ON THE FLOOR TO BE REPURCHASED. IT'S NOT AN EXCITING JOB IT'S NOT WHAT I WOULD CHOOSE TO DO AND BECAUSE OF HIS PRODUCTIVITY RATE WHICH UNDER THE FEDERAL LAW IS REQUIRED TO BE REMEASURED EVERY SIX MONTHS. HE WAS RATED ABOUT A JOB COACH HE WAS DOING HIS JOB HE LOVED IT. HE WAS TALKING TO STAFF THE BEST BUY. HE WAS TALKING TO PEOPLE IN THE PUBLIC EVERY DAY. AND I LOOKED AT HIM I THOUGHT HE WAS CRAZY THIS WOULD NOT BE A CHOICE THAT I WOULD MAKE BUT THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE. OF THE STATE'S LANHAM ACT WHICH IS OUR- ESTEEMED GUIDANCE ON THIS AND LAW THAT NO OTHER STATE REALLY HAS. ALLOWS THE PERSON WITH THE DISABILITY. TO MAKE THE CHOICE OF WHAT SUITS THEM. THIS BILL. PROPOSES TO GET RIGHT IN THE WAY OF THAT AND CONFLICT WITH THAT. AND LET'S BE CLEAR ABOUT WHAT THIS BILL SAYS. IT DOES NOT GET THESE PEOPLE MINIMUM WAGE WHAT IT SAYS IS. LET'S HAVE A PLAN. CONDUCTED BY THE DEPARTMENT. TO MAYBE SEE HOW WE MIGHT GIVE IT TO US. WE HAVE NO OBJECTION TO HAVING THAT DISCUSSION WHAT WE OBJECT TO IS PUTTING A TERMINATION DATE. IN PLACE AT THE SAME TIME WITHOUT HAVING THAT PLAN I THINK THAT HAVING A FUNDING COMMITMENT. THAT WILL IMPACT TWELVE THOUSAND PEOPLE AND PUT THEM OUT OF THEIR JOBS OF THEIR CHOICE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU MISTER LONDON. K. WE HAVE I WANT ONE MORE WITNESS IN OPPOSITION WE HAVE- CRYSTAL HERMAN. AND HER MOM MARCHERS. THIS CALL THEN. CHAIRMAN THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING US TO SPEAK MY NAME IS MARGARET SHARES. AND THAT'S WHAT MY DAUGHTER HARRIMAN THAT COULD STILL HAPPEN. YOU TELL ME HOW YOU LIKE THE ROMAN CENTER AND WHAT IT MEANS TO YOU. HELLO VERY LUCKY HE- IT AND FRANCE AND THEIR FAMILIES. TODAY  WOULD LIKE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THE SENATE BILL NUMBER ONE IT'S SIX THIRTY NINE THE FAIR STANDARDS ACT FROM ROOSEVELT START TO SIGN THIS ACT INTO LAW IN NINETEEN THIRTY NINE HIS INTENT WAS FOR THIS LANDMARK LAW TO BE DESIGNED TO PROTECT THE RIGHTS. OF DISABLED WORKERS. VI&lt;c.cyan&gt;&lt;/c&gt; ELIMINATING THE SPECIAL- WAY CERTIFICATE THIS THE FOURTEENTH SEE- WELL ELECTED WHICH ALLOWS THEM I USED TO RECEIVE LESS THIS VERY SPECIAL LABOR CODE THAT BENEFITS DAUGHTER OF MY DAUGHTER. AND OTHERS LIKE HER ABOUT TWELVE THOUSAND APPROXIMATELY IN CALIFORNIA ALONE THIS ALLOWS HER TO WORK AT HER OWN PACE WITHOUT THINGS IT AND STRESS OTHER JOBS PROVIDE. SHE HAS TRIED ALL THE OTHER JOBS SHE'S BEEN IN OTHER PROGRAMS. I WOULD LIKE TO SHARE THAT THESE PROGRAMS ARE HIGHLY REGULATED BY THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT. OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS AND THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR. THE SENATE IS REQUIRED TO DO FREQUENT THE STUDIES AND REPORT THE STUDIES THAT BE. STARTED ON THE KIDS IN THERE. I SHOULD SAY PROTESTS OFFENSE AND THEIR WORK. INTEGRATED EMPLOYEE IS IDEAL FOR THOSE WHO COULD DO IT. BUT WHAT ABOUT THE ONES WHO CANNOT. WHAT ABOUT THE WITH THE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF THE PROGRAM- SO MANY LEVELS TO CRYSTALS PROGRAM. SHE CAN MAKE HER OWN CHOICES AND CHOOSE TO MOVE UP AND MOVE OUT IF SHE SHE OR SHE IF SHE CHOOSES TO I'M SORRY I'M A LITTLE NERVOUS. OKAY THERE'S ONE OF MINE A SUPPORT THERE'S COMMUNITY SUPPORTS. THEIR SUPPORTED EMPLOYMENT WITH COVERAGES AND THERE'S EVEN PLATE PAID INTERNSHIP ALL WITHIN HER CENTER. FINALLY WHAT MAKES THESE CENTERS ESSENTIAL IS THE SUPPORT THE PROVIDE THE WORKERS. IDINA MEDICAL ISSUES SUCH AS SEIZURES WHICH HAPPENED DALY. M. BEHAVIORS MELTDOWNS WHICH ALSO COULD HAVE BEEN DALY THOSE CAN'T BE AND NO NORMAL WORKSITE WORKPLACE. WHAT ABOUT PROTECTION AGAINST INAPPROPRIATE SEXUAL ADVANCES YOU ARE HEARD HOW MY DAUGHTER SPOKE TO YOU HOW IS SHE SUPPOSED TO GET HER POINT ACROSS THAT SHE'S BEING INFLUENCE ONE WAY OR ANOTHER AT THE WORK SITE WHEN THERE'S NO ONE THERE TO GUIDE HER. AND HIGH SCHOOL CRYSTAL WAS AND WILL FOLLOW IN A WORKABILITY PROGRAM. SHE WAS TRAINED AND SHE WAS ALSO CERTIFICATE AND WORKING PROPER PROCEDURES AT MILLENNIUM EMPLOYER SUCH AS PAT MARC. DOLLAR TREE RASS. AMBER FREY TYPER RESTAURANTS. EVERY EMPLOYER EVERY EMPLOYER THAT SHE HAD I TOLD HER THEY COULD NOT HIRE HER BECAUSE OF HER LIMITED SPEECH THEY WOULD TAKE HER ON WITH A ONE ON ONE BUT THEN WHERE IS THE LOVE LEAST RESTRICTION MEANS MY DAUGHTER WOULD HAVE TO GO TO WORK WITH SOMEONE. TO SPEAK WITH HER EVERY DAY THAT'S NOT LEAST RESTRICTIVE. K. AS THEY TOLD YOU THEY CAN HIRE BECAUSE OF HER SPEECH AND THEY WANTED AN INTERPRETER FOR. SECONDLY CENTER PRODUCTIVE. PRODUCTIVE READY- IS SLOWER THAN MOST. SHE WAS ALWAYS BEING PRESSURED WHICH WAS CAUSING A GREAT DEAL OF ANXIETY AND STRESS. AT THE TIME SHE DIDN'T WANT TO GO TO WORK. SHE WOULD CALL AND TELL ME THAT SHE WOULD WANT TO STAY HOME. SIX YEARS AGO WE FOUND THE ROMAN CENTER. SHE'S BEEN THERE EVERY SENSE MISSING ONLY DAYS WHEN SHE'S FORCED TO FOR DOCTORS OR WHAT HAVE YOU. THIS CENTER MIGHT BE KNOWN AS A SHELTERED CENTER. AND IT IS PLAIN LESS THAN MINIMUM WAGE TO CRYSTAL AND MANY LIKE HER IT IS SO MUCH MORE. IT IS THEIR LIFE LIKE I SAID NOW SHE NEVER MISSES A DAY WORK SHE NEVER COMES HOME CRYING OR ANXIOUS OR DEPRESSED. SHE GETS HER FANS READY AT NIGHT MAKES OUR LIVES EASIER FOR THE NEXT DAY SHE COMES HOME WITH A SMILE OR SMILE LARGER THAN THE GRAND CANYON WHEN SHE HAD FACT CHECKED. CRYSTAL DOES NOT UNDERSTAND THE VALUE OF MONEY. BUT SHE DOES UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT TECHNIQUE. THANK YOU SO MUCH INTO THE COMMUNITY. AND WE SPEND THAT CHECKED AND SHE'S CERTAINLY KNOWS HOW TO SPEND HER MONEY THAT SHE HAS EARNED. AS A PARENT I CANNOT EXPRESS. HOW MUCH IS THIS WARMS MY HEART. WHEN KRISTA WAS BORN THE DOCTORS TOLD ME SHE MUST BE INSTITUTIONALIZED THAT IS THE BEST PLACE FOR HER. THAT IS NOT THE BEST PLACE FOR SHE'S WORKING IN OUR COMMUNITY IT MIGHT BE A SHELTERED COMMUNITY. I MIGHT BE PAYING A LITTLE BIT LESS. BUT IT'S HER COMMUNITY AND HAS HER JOB THAT SHE WAKES UP FOR EVERY MORNING. TODAY I ASK YOU TO CONSIDER THE CIVIL RIGHTS NOT ONLY OF MY DAUGHTER BUT THE OTHER TWELVE THOUSAND OTHER PARTICIPANTS OR IN WORKSHOPS LIKE HER. TO ALLOW THEM TO CONTINUE TO WORK AND THRIVE IN A PALE PLACE THAT MEETS THE NEEDS AND ALLOWS THEM TO BE A PERFECT ACTIVE MEMBER OF OUR SOCIETY. IF YOU TAKE THIS AWAY I ASSURE YOU THE IMPACT WOULD BE VERY MUCH LIKE THE CLOVER IN QUARANTINE. DEPRESSION SETTIN QUICK. SHE DIDN'T WANT TO LEAVE HER ROOM SHE WAS SAD ALL THE TIME AND SHE PUT ON A LOT OF WEIGHT THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING TO TESTIFY CRYSTAL AND VISITORS WE REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR TESTIMONY. OKAY DO WE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE MEMBERS- MISTER WORK. THANK YOU AND I ARE ONE THINGS ARE DRUGS- FOR AUTHORING THIS BILL I REALLY ALARMING THAT THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON REALLY RIGHT UNDER US- I KNOW WE TALKED A LITTLE BIT TO SPEND THEN THE OUT LABOR EMPLOYMENT COMMITTEE ON BUT I EIGHT I DO- AT AT THE IN THE SEAT IN THE SEAT OF MY HEART REALLY BELIEVE THIS IS A MORAL OBLIGATION THAT WE CORRECTLY TALK ABOUT WORKING WITH THE VALUE OF WORK IS AND REGARDLESS OF SOMEBODY HAS A- INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY A CHALLENGE OR NOT- PEOPLE DESERVE TO BE. PAID UP TO HER WELFARE WAGE- AND FOR THOSE IT JUST REALLY SUCKS WRONGLY WITH ME THAT YOU KNOW WE HEAR THE VOICES THAT- PEOPLE ARE GOING TO FEAR THAT THEY'RE GOING TO LOSE THEIR JOB. B. WE ARE TRYING TO GET THEM UP TO A STANDARD THAT WE WANT TO SEE FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. AND WE PICKED THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE ALREADY PROBABLY STRESS WITH A LOT OF THINGS IN THEIR LIVES. WITH THE- NOTION OR THE FEAR. THAT SOMETHING LIKE THIS WHICH IS MEANT TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THEM. ADDITIONAL INCOME ADDITIONAL SUPPORT TO BE ABLE TO TAKE THAT OUT INTO THE COMMUNITY. THAT SOMEHOW THEY'RE GOING TO LOSE SOMETHING FROM THAT- THAT THAT ARGUMENT IS THAT WEALTHY ON ON SEVERAL LEVELS. AND I HOPE THIS IS THE KIND OF WORK ALSO THAT CATALYZES SOME INTEREST AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. TO BE ABLE TO READ IS THIS AS WELL AS THE OTHER STATES ARE STARTING TO. GO IN THIS DIRECTION I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT- AND- YOU KNOW I KNOW THAT YOU ARE SETTING THE CLOCK TODAY- OR THAT HIS PASSES AND BECOMES LAW. NOT THAT WE NEED TO GET THIS RIGHT WITHIN THREE YEARS I KNOW THAT'S% AGGRESSIVE BUT ATTAINABLE AND SO WE SHOULD BE HEADING DOWN THIS PATH WE SHOULD MAKE SURE BECAUSE THE WORK HAS TO GET DONE WHETHER. YOU'RE STOCKING SHELVES- SOMEBODY'S GOING TO HAVE TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT WORK AND THEY OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO BE PAID. A FAIR WAGE AT LEAST A MINIMUM WAGE- AND SO OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT THREE YEARS I IMAGINE WE WILL BE. CONTINUING TO MONITOR THIS VERY CLOSELY TO MAKE SURE THE PROTECTIONS ARE THERE. SO THAT INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE FEARFUL THAT THEIR EMPLOYER MIGHT BE USING THIS OPPORTUNITY AGAINST THEM. THAT THAT WE ARE THERE TO STAND UP FOR THEM TO. THAT THEY'RE NOT GOING TO LOSE THEIR JOB WE WILL WELL I THINK WE NEED TO STAY CLOSE ON THIS ISSUE AND CONTINUE TO MONITOR IT SO THAT THERE ARE NO. ADVERSE IMPACT THAT THAT WE'RE MEETING THAT- IMPORTANT GOALS THAT WE SEEK FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS SO THANK YOU FOR. DOING THIS BILL I'M HAPPY TO MAKE A MOTION TO SUPPORT THE BILL- AND WILL BE GOING FOR TODAY. I SOMEONE. THANK YOU TO AND- ON THE SENATE TO SO ON THIS THAT YOU INTENT OF THE P. FOR THE L. P. OVER THE DISEASE SO TO GET THAT PAID EQUAL AMOUNT THAT THAT IS THE MINIMUM AMOUNT. EVEN THOUGH YOUR INTENT IS UNDERSTANDABLE BUT I'M AFRAID THE ESTá NOT ON THE- JEOPARDIZING IT MAY BE- YOU YOU WE CAN COME UP WITH A CERTAIN MANAGER SO FOR THOSE WHO ARE ALREADY UP AND PER LEAD TO A DEAL CURRENT JOB MAY BE PROTECTED DAHLE BUT WHAT ABOUT THE- FUTURE- IN OPPORTUNITIES OF FOR THOSE SO WHO- WITH THE- DISABILITIES- BECAUSE- EMPLOYERS SO- WHEN THE HIGHER THE HIGH YEAR- WITH KIA KIND THE MIND TO HELP THEM AND OFFER THEM TO STAND ON THEIR FEET AND THOSE SOCIAL REASONS SO. I EVEN THOUGHT OF COULD BE SELF STANDARD PAY- I HAVE BEEN EXPERIENCE- A MYSELF FOR AT THE STATE OF IRVINE WE HIRED THE QUITE A FEW PEOPLE WITH A DISABILITY ASM BUT THE I NOTICES. THAT THE WE HAVE TO PROVIDE A FOURTH TIME- STAFF- TO SUPERVISE THEM EVERY MOVE- EVERY DIRECTION THEY GO- SO IT DOES COST EXTRA MONEY- TO SUPERVISE THEM BECAUSE THAT DEPENDING UPON THE SEVERITY OF WHAT THEY ARE DISABILITY SOME MAY NEED OR DEDUCTIBLES WE SENT SOME MAY NOT THOUGH- SO ETCETERA. SO FOR THE FUTURE- A POTENTIAL EMPLOYER SO- WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT THE HOUSE GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY SO FOR THOSE KIND OF PEOPLE WITH A DISABILITY IS BUT- THE- IF WE STOP DEMANDING. ARE YOU GOING TO PAY OKAY THEN KNOW WHAT INCENTIVE WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT MY SHOULD DIE. ACOSTA WHEN I CAN HIRE SOMEBODY WITH THE NORTH DISABILITIES HONDA- CAN PRODUCE SO- EXPECTED INSTEAD OF STANDARD THE WALK POLITY SO- EVEN SO INTENT IS ARE HELPING THEM. OUT WITH A MORE PAID BUT THE FOR THE LONG RUN THIS MAY BE DUE SERVICES TO THEM BECAUSE OF SUCH A JOB OPPORTUNITY MAY BE DIMINISHED. WHEN I THINK ABOUT THAT. WELL I'M- TIMES THAT ONLY WAY SOMEBODY COULD GET AT LEAST. THE MINIMUM WAGE THE OR CAN'T GET MINIMUM WAGE IS BECAUSE BECAUSE OF THEIR- DISABILITY I'M SADDENED BY THAT I THINK THAT WE AS A SOCIETY NEED TO CHANGE OUR ATTITUDES TOWARDS THOSE WHO ARE DIFFERENT THEY HAVE DIFFERENT POTENTIAL THEY HAVE DIFFERENT SKILLS THEY ARE A DIFFERENT HUMAN BEING JUST LIKE YOU AND ME WE DON'T HAVE THE SAME WE DON'T HAVE THE SAME SKILLS WE DON'T HAVE THE SAME LIFE EXPERIENCES BUT WE EXPECT TO BE TREATED IN SOME FUNDAMENTAL WAYS THE SAME. AND SO WHAT I'M TRYING TODO HERE IS SAY THAT ALL THESE INDIVIDUALS WE NEED TO GIVE THEM THE OPPORTUNITY AND BREAK DOWN THESE ATTITUDINAL BARRIERS THAT WE FACE THAT THEY FACE I'M SADDENED TO HEAR OF THE YOUNG WOMAN AND ALL THE PRESSURE AND THE STRESS AND THE ATTITUDES AGAINST HER IN HER WORKPLACE BUT THE WAY TO DEAL WITH THAT IS NOT BY PAYING THEM LESS. THE WAY TO DEAL WITH THAT IS BY MAKING SURE THAT THE RESPECT FOR CIVIL RIGHTS ARE WE ARE THAT OUR CIVIL RIGHTS ARE RESPECTED THAT'S THE WAY TO DEAL WITH THAT SO I DON'T THINK THAT WE SHOULD MEASURE A PERSON AND SAY WELL THEY'RE DISTANT DISABLE SO THEREFORE THEY DON'T DESERVE EVEN THE MINIMUM WAGE THAT'S NOT CORRECT THAT'S NOT RIGHT AND I THINK WE AS A CUT OF THE STATE STAND FOR. LIFTING EVERYONE UP AND WE HAVE WE ARE PUTTING THE RESOURCES ON THE PRACTICAL SIDE WE ARE PUTTING TENS OF MILLIONS OF THE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS INTO THE RESOURCES BOTH FOR EMPLOYERS AND FOR ALL THE SERVICES THAT ARE SISTERS THE BROTHERS WERE DISABLED NEED AND DESERVE SO- I JUST DON'T THINK THIS IS THIS IS ABOUT TREATING PEOPLE ON THE ON THE ISSUE OF A JOB. THEY SHOULD GET PAID JUST LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE. YEAH I HEAR YOU KNOW YOU ARE APPROACHING FROM THE HUMAN EMOTION ON HUMANOS SYMPATHY ASPECT HOWEVER. NOT ALL THE BUSINESS PEOPLE WOULD LOOK AT IT THAT WAY BECAUSE THAT THEY WOULD LOOK AT STUFF. IN A COMBINATION OF- THAT ASPECT AT THAT YOU ARE DESCRIBING BUT AT THE SAME TIME FROM OUR- STANDPOINT OVER HIS- HIS A BUSINESS. YOU HEARD THE MANY MANY. PARENTS AND INDIVIDUALS WITH A DISABILITY SO THEY ARE THE DIRECT VOICE US THAT THEY DO NOT AGREE WITH YOUR SUPPORT AND THAT THEY ALL POLL STUFF. SO ARE YOU TRYING TO TELL THE PROTECT. OUR LOST A TRACK OF THAT THE ROUGHLY HALF AND HALF OR MAYBE A LITTLE LESS US ALL. WHAT A FEW. INDIVIDUALS WITH A DISABILITY SO DON'T AGREE WITH YOU. SO THAT THAT THIS IS SO NOT THE MORAL ISSUE YEAH AND MOTION ARE USED TO YES THEY DO SO MORAL. IF WE CAN BUT THE REALITY GOT TALKING ABOUT THAT THE PRACTICAL SIDE. OF PRACTICAL BUSINESS TO WORRY DON'T WANT NOT TO SEAT US YOU. SEE THANK GOODNESS MY STATE. ASSEMBLY WOMAN DAVIES THANK YOU BETTER CHAIR I'M IF I COULD I HAVE A- FOR. THE WITNESS OF MR. THANK YOU MISTER LIMON I HAVE A QUESTION- IF THIS OF MINIMUM WAGE IS BANNED IN CALIFORNIA FOR PEOPLE WITH THEM I D. D. EVEN THOUGH IT'S STILL LOUD AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. WHAT DO YOU THINK WILL HAPPEN WITH MOST OF THE PEOPLE WORKING IN SUCH PROGRAMS TODAY I HEAR A LOT OF OPPOSITION AND I'M AND I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND. THE INTENTIONS THE GOOD INTENTIONS MY CONCERN THAT IT OULD DO MORE HARM THAN GOOD AND I'M TRYING TO GET A BETTER- YOU KNOW IDEA OF WHAT WILL HAPPEN. THANK YOU. I MEAN. IT HURT THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- SO. IN WATCHING WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING THE PRESSURE ON SOME OF THESE SITUATIONS TO CLOSE AND GO OUT OF BUSINESS IS PRETTY PRETTY GREAT SO WE'RE SEEING. LESS AND LESS OF THESE OPPORTUNITIES AROUND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THESE DAYS. BUT THERE ARE STILL WE BELIEVE AROUND TWELVE THOUSAND PEOPLE WHO STILL TODAY. TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS OPPORTUNITY. AND WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS THAT WHEN THEY LEAVE THE WORKFORCE. THEY TYPICALLY AREN'T FINDING A MINIMUM WAGE OR HIGHER JOB. UNLESS THAT'S OUR GOAL AND WE GET INTO THAT AND THEY MOVE AND SOME PEOPLE DO TRANSITION SUCCESSFULLY THAT WAY. NOT MANY BECAUSE MANY TIMES TO TALK ABOUT PEOPLE AT THE LOWER END OF THE PRODUCTIVITY SCALE. IN THOSE PEOPLE TYPICALLY END UP IN A DAY PROGRAM. WHICH COSTS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ODDLY ENOUGH. ABOUT THREE TIMES AS MUCH MONEY IN TERMS OF THE PAYMENTS OF WHAT. THE STATE PAYS RATE WISE. THAN THEY DO TO A WORK ACTIVITY PROGRAM THE COMPARISON IS ABOUT EIGHTY FIVE DOLLARS TO THIRTY DOLLARS A DAY. PER PERSON SO IF YOU DID THE LITERAL MATH. AND SAID YOU KNOW ALL TWELVE THOUSAND PEOPLE IN INTO A DAY PROGRAM. INSTEAD OF WORKING YOU'D BE TALKING ABOUT A HUNDRED FIFTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS. OUR CONCERN ON THIS OVERALL IS THAT WE LOVE THE IDEA OF HER BY MOVING TO MINIMUM WAGE. AND THIS BILL CREATES A PROCESS TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION. BUT IT HAS THAT SLEDGEHAMMER TERMINATION DATE IN IT. WITHOUT HAVING A SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM IDENTIFIED WE WOULD RATHER SEE. THEM COME BACK TO YOU. WITH AN OUTLINE OF A PROGRAM TELL YOU HOW THEY'RE GOING TO FUND IT. AND THEN YOU DECIDE UPPER NOW WITH THAT MAKES SENSE TO YOU AS A- AS A PROGRAM BEFORE YOU KILL OFF THESE JOBS. SO THAT THAT'S A- LONGER ANSWER MOST PEOPLE IF THEY DON'T. HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY WE DON'T SUBSIDIZE OR WE DON'T DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT. THEY'RE GONNA MOVE INTO SOME OTHER PROGRAMS LIKE A DAY PROGRAM IT WILL NOT BE EMPLOYMENT. ALMOST. CERTAINLY THANK YOU THANK. MADAM CHAIR. OR STAY HOME THAT'S THE ALTERED THEY JUST HOME CORRECT. IF I MAY- HAVE A QUESTION THROUGH THE CHAIR FOR THE CENTER YES THANK YOU. THAT'S SENATOR THAT'S THAT'S MY QUESTION IS IN REGARDS TO FUNDING BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE A BUSINESS AND YOU WANT YOU WANT TO BRING IN THESE EMPLOYEES BUT THEY'RE GIVING ABOUT 25% PRODUCTIVITY OBVIOUSLY YOU NEED TO EMPLOY MORE TO BE ABLE TO GET. WHAT YOU NEED DONE WHERE IS THE FUNDING FOR THE BUSINESS- OWNER TO COMPENSATE- WITH THE FACT THAT THEY'RE GOING TO NEED TO BRING IN MORE EMPLOYEES TO- YOU KNOW YOU. TO REACH THE PRODUCTIVITY THAT THEY NEED. WELL JUST THIS LEGISLATURE ALONE IS ALREADY INVESTING AND ADDING TO. THE AMOUNT OF MONEY- TO MAKEA SUCCESSFUL TRANSITION OF INDIVIDUALS WILL BE OUT OF THESE SHELTERED WORKSHOPS AS I SAID EARLIER. THERE IS AN ADDITIONAL SIXTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS FOR REGIONAL CENTER SERVICE COORDINATORS. WHO ARE GOING TO ASSIST INDIVIDUALS MOVING OUT OF THE WORKSHOPS. WE HAVE WE'RE INVESTING IN THESE COMPETITIVE INTEGRATED EMPLOYMENT. DOUBLING THE INCENTIVE PAYMENTS TO SERVICE PROVIDERS. I MEAN THERE THOSE ARE JUST TWO EXAMPLES OF THE STATE LEVEL AND THERE'S ALSO FEDERAL FUNDS AVAILABLE. SO THAT THE FUNDING IS THERE THE QUESTION IS HOW WILL IT BE USED. AND I ABSOLUTELY HAVE ENORMOUS RESPECT AND ADMIRATION FOR ALL THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO CALLED IN. WHO ARE UP P A DISABLED HAVE A DISABILITY- AND AS YOU HEARD. THERE ARE THOSE WHO SAY THEY SUPPORT AND THERE ARE THOSE WHO SAY THEY DON'T SUPPORT. I HOPE. THAT YOU KNOW THIS IS NOT- IS NOT THIS IT'S NOT BECAUSE SHOULDN'T BE FACING THIS FEAR. THAT AN EMPLOYER IS GOING TO DISCRIMINATE AGAINST THEM. THAT SHOULD NOT EXIST WE SHOULD NOT ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN IN CALIFORNIA. THAT SOMEBODY DOESN'T GET HIRED BECAUSE THEY'RE BEING DISCRIMINATED AGAINST. THAT'S WHAT ALL OF OUR- CIVIL RIGHTS LAWS HAVE BEEN ABOUT THAT SOMEBODY DOESN'T GET DISCRIMINATED AGAINST BECAUSE OF WHO THEY ARE. AND THAT'S WHAT WE OUGHT OF MAKE SURE HAPPENS- AS THEY GET INTEGRATED. INTO DIFFERENT- WORKPLACES. THANK YOU I JUST JUST WANNA MAKE A COMMENT COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND THAT I THINK MY CONCERN IS THAT WE HAVE THE FUNDING. BUT IT HASN'T BEEN DESIGNATED AND UNFORTUNATELY WE WATCH THIS BEFORE WHERE WE HAVE THE FUNDING BUT IT'S NOT GOING WHERE THE FUNDING IS. WE PUT THE CART BEFORE THE HORSE WHERE IS I'D LIKE TO SEE WHERE THE FUND IS GOING WORDS THERE IN WRITING SAYING THIS IS WHAT'S GOING TO THE BUSINESS THIS IS WHAT'S GOING ON HERE. SO THAT I KNOW THAT WHEN I VOTE ON SOMETHING LIKE THIS I KNOW THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO ACTUALLY- THEY HANDLE THIS BILL IS GOING TO BE UP IN PROTECTIVE BAIL. AND IT'S GOING TO BENEFIT EVERYONE IT'S SO THAT'S MY CONCERN RIGHT NOW IS JUST BECAUSE WE HAVE THE MONEY AND UNFORTUNATELY IT'S IN THE PAST DOESN'T MEAN IT'S GOING TO GO WHERE IT NEEDS TO GO. SO I DO APPRECIATE THIS THANK YOU. THANK YOU. DO WE HAVE ANY OTHER MEMBERS HAVE QUESTIONS FOR. OF OKAY M. ASSEMBLY MEMBER PUT UP IN ASSAM AND STONE. TO THE CHAIR- I CONCUR WITH YOU CENTER THAT WE MUST WE HAVE TO TREAT EVERYONE. I CONCUR FARE UP THE WITH THIS BILL. AND I HOPE YOU CAN ANSWER THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES ON INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE. LITERALLY TRYING TO DO. THE BEST. FOR DO YOU HAVE ANY ANY ANY CONCERNS WITH THAT. WELL I WOULDN'T BE DOING THIS BILL IF IT WAS GOING TO LEAVE PEOPLE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE OVERNIGHT WITHOUT JOBS THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS IS ABOUT AND THIS IS- BUT I'D LIKE MAYBE. ONE OR TWO OF MY WITNESSES WHO HAVE THE DAY TO DAY EXPERIENCE WITH THAT WHO COULD ANSWER THAT QUESTION MAYBE- MISTER CARRUTHERS YES. THANK YOU SENATOR ASSEMBLY MEMBER ERIN CARUTHERS IN THE STATE COUNCIL ON EVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES WE SHARE THAT SAME CONCERN. THERE'S AN INTERESTING CONNECTION MADE OF ALL PEOPLE IN THE THIS PROGRAM MOVE INTO EMPLOYMENT I THINK THAT MAY BE AN UNFAIR PARALLEL. THE QUESTION REALLY IS WILL PLE IN THIS PROGRAM AND I'M NOT GOING TO CALL ANYTHING TO PAY SEVENTY TWO DOLLARS AN HOUR A JOB I'M NOT GONNA DO THAT. WELL IN THIS PROGRAM WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO GET IS CONSTRUCTED A MEANINGFUL DAY AND WHAT'S MEANINGFUL TO THEM IS GOING TO BE INDIVIDUAL AND SPECIFIC TO EACH PERSON SO IT MAY BE EMPLOYMENT IT MAY BE A COMPETITOR GREAT EMPLOYMENT OR MAYBE OTHER PROGRAMS THAT ARE OFFERED TO THE REGIONAL CENTER SO THE GOAL I THINK IS NOT JOB TO JOB OR THIS PROGRAM SEVEN WHICH TO ANOTHER JOB IT'S FROM THIS PROGRAM INTO. A MEANINGFUL DAY FOR THEM. SO IF YOU DON'T MIND ME ASKING OF THE QUESTION IS. SO THE FOURTEENTH SEED CODE THAT THAT. THE OTHER FOLKS WERE TALKING ABOUT- THAT'S GONNA GET ELIMINATED OKAY I MEAN. WILL THEY STILL BE ABLE TO PICK. WHERE THEY WANT TO GO WHERE THEY WANT TO WORK. I MEAN YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF BUSINESSES THAT ARE. FOR PROFIT THAT CAN PROBABLY OBSERVE ABSORB THIS. WITH THERE'S A LOT OF NONPROFITS DO THAT WILL MAKE A DECISION SAYING. YOU MAY WE HAVE TO CUT BACK AND I JUST DON'T WANT. TO LOSE JOBS YOU KNOW I MEAN I AM AN UNCLE. IT HAS BEEN WE THAT THAT AT MY NEPHEW'S DISABLED. I HAVE STAFF THAT WAS WORKING IN OUR DISTRICT. TO GET FOLKS THAT THAT SHOULD BE DISABLED GO THROUGH DISABILITY. AND I I'M I'M CONSTANTLY FIGHTING TO. IT IS A TOUGH FIGHT. YEAH I BUT I DON'T WANT TO GO THROUGH WHERE WE ARE GOING TO LOSE JOBS YOU KNOW THAT INDIVIDUALS ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO PICK AND CHOOSE. I CONCUR WITH WITH THE SENATE THAT THIS HAS TO BE FAIR. BUT I DON'T WANT TO GO A YEAR DOWN THE LINE AND SAY AND- TWELVE THOUSAND JOBS THAT NOW WE'RE DOWN TO NINE THOUSAND JOBS. AND THEN ONE MORE QUESTION I HAVE- YOU GUYS MENTIONED THAT OTHER STATES ARE DOING THIS. YOU KNOW I LIKE TO HEAR AND HOW. HOW IS THAT COMING UP FOR THE STATE'S YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN ANYONE FROM THE OTHER SIDE IF THEY CAN ALSO- ANSWER THAT. YEAH WHAT ARE YOUR FROM BOTH SIDES BECAUSE- WHATEVER TODAY WAS. A LOT OF PEOPLE AGAINST THIS. AND I'M I'M I'M SHOCKED I'M BOTHERED ABOUT. THANK YOU SIR FOR YOUR YOUR COMPASSION YOUR INVESTMENT IN THE ISSUE IN YOUR INVESTMENTS AND REALLY AN ACT OF LOVE FOR PEOPLE TO HAVE OF MEANINGFUL IMPORTANT LIVES. REGARDING OTHER STATES PART OF THE STATUTE THE BILL HAS BEEN PROPOSED SAYS LOOK AT THOSE LESSONS FROM THOSE OTHER STATES AND MAKE SURE WE KNOW WHAT THOSE ARE. NOW REGARDING THE EMPLOYMENT WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN ALL ALL SEE THE MICROPHONE TO A CHICKEN HERE IS THAT. SOME HAVE ACTUALLY TRANSITIONED INTO OTHER EMPLOYMENT SO PEOPLE THE SECRETARY OR FAMILIAR WITH PRIDE INDUSTRIES- WELL KNOWN IN THIS AREA AND THEY DECIDE TO STOP DOING FOURTEEN SEES. AND THEY MOVED INTO EMPLOYMENT INFORMATION OR STANDING NO WAS LAID OFF BUT PEOPLE ARE NOT BEING PAID MINIMUM WAGE I'M PEOPLE DEVELOPING A DISABILITY SO. THE STATE INVESTS IN ENTITIES IN THESE PROGRAMS TO MAKE THAT TRANSITION THERE'S A FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLAR POT THAT'S BEEN AVAILABLE FOR EVERY YEAR FOR THE PAST FIVE YEARS AND WILL BE AVAILABLE NEXT YEAR. WHERE THESE PROGRAMS CAN COME FORWARD AND BID FOR MONEY FROM THE STATE TO SAY HOW CAN I CHANGE HOW CAN I MODERNIZE BUT- CAN BEHIND ME CAN SPEAK MORE DIRECTLY BECAUSE HE IS A PROVIDER WHO MADE THE TRANSITION. THANK YOU SIR ONE OF THE SPECIFIC QUESTIONS THAT YOU ASKED WERE IN PARTICULAR FELT LIKE NON PROFITS VERSUS FOR PROFIT ENTITIES- I'LL GIVE YOU A COUPLE SPECIFIC EXAMPLE SO SOMETIMES PEOPLE TALK ABOUT LIKE OUR PARTNERSHIP WITH THE SAN DIEGO ZOO OBVIOUSLY THAT'S A LARGE ENTITY WHAT WE MORE OF OUR PARTNERSHIPS ARE LIKE OPERABLE PHARMACY IT SLUR TWO PEOPLE WORKING THERE AND THEY'VE HIRED A PERSON FROM OUR POPULATION. A VERY- RECENT EXAMPLE OF SAN DIEGO PRIDE WHICH IS A NONPROFIT WHO HAVE HAD A TERRIBLE FISCAL YEAR BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC THEY RECENTLY HIRED THREE PEOPLE FROM OUR PROGRAM TO PERFORM SOME WORK FOR THEM AS THEY GET READY FOR- THERE AT THE PRIDE FESTIVAL IN JULY A USES EXAMPLE BECAUSE WHETHER IT'S A NN PROFIT- LIKE MYSELF OR LIKE CYNICAL PRIDE OR A LARGE FOR PROFIT LIKE THE SAN DIEGO ZOO OR SMALL MOM AND POP BUSINESS LIKE THE PHARMACY. IT STILL COMES DOWN TO A CHOICE OF HEY DO YOU WANT TO ALLOW US TO COME IN SUPPORT YOU TO SUPPORT OTHERS SENT MISSILE WE DO SO IT'S REALLY JUST ABOUT BILL SUPPORTS BUT NOT AROUND AND YOU CAN TRAIN A BUSINESSES AND TRAIN THEIR MANAGERS AND THEIR EMPLOYEES TO WORK WITH THE POPULATION THAT WE SUPPORT I WAS. TO THAT ANSWER YOUR QUESTION OR- YEAH IF YOU COULD. HOW HOW ARE THE OTHER STATES DOING. SO I THAT IS MORE OF A FOR ERIN CROTHERS I CAN JUST TELL YOU WHAT WE DO HERE- IN ACROSS THE STATE WE OPERATE NOT JUST IN SAN DIEGO BUT THE INLAND EMPIRE IN THE SILICON VALLEY SO WE'RE OPERATING A VERY HIGH COST AREAS AS WELL AS LOWER COST AREAS. AND I GUESS WE CAN THAT WE'RE NOT HAVING PUSHED BACK TO PEOPLE EMPLOYING OUR FOLKS WE JUST ARTICULATE TO THEM WHY THIS IS VALUABLE TO THEM WE NEVER TALK ABOUT IT FROM A PERSPECTIVE OF WOULD YOU PLEASE HIRE SOMEONE. YEAH IT MEANS THANK YOU FOR SPEAKING UP TONY I MIGHT MY CONCERN IS THIS IS THAT I DON'T WANT TO LOSE HAVE FOLKS WITHOUT A JOB. YOU KNOW- IT WAS MENTIONED HERE THAT YOU KNOW THEY'RE RESPONDING. RIGHT AND THERE'S GONNA BE FUNNY IN THE STATE ALWAYS SEEMS TO LEAD BUT- I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT FUNDING IS GOING INTO NOT TAKEN AWAY. HASN'T TO ME IS NOT ABOUT THE FIFTEEN DOLLAR. OR THE REYES I THINK THEY SHOULD DESERVE IT. BUT I JUST DON'T WANT THEM WITHOUT A JOB. IF THEY HAVE A JOB WE HAD TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE PROTECTING THAT JOB THEY HAVE. NOT TAKEN AWAY SO THANK YOU SIR. VENTURA IF I COULD TAKE A CRACK AT THAT- I WANT TO GIVE YOU JUST A COUPLE PIECES OF FACTUAL INFORMATION AND FACTS ARE STUBBORN THINGS RIGHT. THIS STATE SEVEN YEARS AGO WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHESBRO WAS IN YOUR SAME SEAT- BASICALLY IN THE LEGISLATURE. HE PASSED A BILL THAT COMMITTED THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO BE CALLED AN EMPLOYMENT FOR STATE. FOR PEOPLE WITH INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENT DISABILITIES. I WAS TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN WHEN IN FACT JANUARY FIRST. TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN. HERE WE ARE SEVEN YEARS LATER. AND THE EMPLOYMENT RATE OF OUR POPULATIONS OF PEOPLE WITH INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES IS EXACTLY THE SAME. WE SAT A MADE IN THE STATE THE TOP PRIORITY FOR ALL PEOPLE WITH INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES EMPLOYMENT FIRST THAT'S THE FIRST THING WE SHOULD DO FOR THEM AND YET OUR EMPLOYMENT RATE IS STILL AT 14% THE SAME AS IT WAS SEVEN YEARS AGO. AND NINE POINTS BELOW THE NATIONAL AVERAGE. THE NATIONAL AVERAGE FOR THIS POPULATION IS TWENTY THREE PERCENT. CALIFORNIA'S AT FOURTEEN. NOW IT AND WE HAVE NO DISCOMFORT WITH ANYTHING IN THIS BILL. IN TERMS OF THE PROCESS TO COME UP WITH A GREAT PLAN. BUT HAVING THE TERMINATION DATE SET OUT THERE AS PART OF THAT WITHOUT THE PLAN. IS THE PROBLEM. AND SO WHAT YOU'RE SUGGESTING I THINK IS RIGHT PROTECT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE IN THEIR JOBS TODAY DEVELOP A GREAT PLAN. AND THEN WHEN YOU GET THAT PLAN COME BACK AND TELL US WHAT IT IS AND HOW YOU'RE GOING TO FIND IT. IF YOU GUYS WANT TO MAKE THE LEAP THEN YOU SHOULD DO IT. BUT I HAVE SEEN THIS MOVIE FOR MANY YEARS AND WE'RE JUST NOT DOING A GREAT JOB. WHATEVER MONEY WE PUT INTO THOSE OF EMPLOYING THIS POPULATION. THIS BILL LITERALLY WOULD KNOCK IN THREE YEARS. TWELVE THOUSAND PEOPLE OUT OF POSITIONS THAT THEY HAVE CHOSEN TO BE IN TODAY. THERE'S NO GETTING AROUND THAT YOUR CHOICE THEN IS THEY WILL EITHER BE. GIVEN MINIMUM WAGE TO STAY IN THAT OR ANOTHER JOB. SOMEHOW THERE'S NOTHING THAT SPECIFIES HOW THAT'S GONNA WORK YOU COULD SUBSIDIZES. THE STATE COULD SAY WE'RE GONNA COME FOR THE POT OF MONEY AND FILL THE GAP BETWEEN THE PERSONS FOURTEEN SEE WAGE. AND THE WAY TO THE EMPLOYERS GOING TO PAYING WHICH IS MINIMAL WE COULD DO THAT. THEY'RE BENT TO BILLS IN THE PAST THAT OFFERED A TAX CREDIT TO EMPLOYERS. ON THAT SPREAD WHICH WOULD MAKE IT EASIER FOR EMPLOYERS TO SWALLOW SOMEBODY WHO'S AT A LOWER PRODUCTIVITY LEVEL BUT WE KILL BOTH OF THOSE BILLS. BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO LOWER THE PROP NINETY EIGHT BASE IN THE STATE. SO THERE ARE IDEAS AND WAYS TO GET OF THIS WE'RE TOTALLY OPEN TO BEING A PART OF THAT. I WILL TELL YOU THAT I AM PLEASED. THAT CENTER DORADO ADDED SOME OF THE PEOPLE WHO DO FOURTEEN C. PROGRAMS TODAY TO THE BILL IN TERMS OF STAKEHOLDERS WHO WILL PARTICIPATE IN THAT PROCESS. I AM JUST OUR ORGANIZATION IS ABSOLUTELY UNCOMFORTABLE KILLING OFF THOSE JOBS UNTIL WE HAVE THE PLAN. YOU COULD GRANDFATHER MEN THAT BE ANOTHER WAY TO DO IT GRANDFATHER THOSE PEOPLE IN TODAY LET HIM KEEP THEIR JOB AND MOVE INTO SOMETHING NEW IF IT DEVELOPS. THOSE ARE JUST SOME IDEAS. SIR I AM ARE YOU GET A SOMEONE OKAY A SOMEONE'S STYLE. THANK YOU I THINK WE HEAR THE EMOTION ON THIS ISSUE REALLY ON BOTH SIDES. AND TO THE WAY ADVOCACY GOES IS SOMETIMES WE GET FOLKS WHO. WORKED UP ABOUT AN ISSUE. PARTIAL INFORMATION AND I ALWAYS FIND THAT TO BE. SAD AND POTENTIALLY USE. THEM BEEN TALKING TO A NUMBER OF PEOPLE ACROSS THE BOARD. ON THIS ISSUE AND I JUST WANTED TO MAKE THAT STATEMENT THAT I THINK WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL. ABOUT THE EMOTIONS AND FOR US WE NEED TO STEP BACK AND TAKE A LOOK AT THE BIGGER PICTURE HERE. AND WHAT'S BEING PRESENTED AND TALKED ABOUT LOOKS LIKE ZERO SON AND IT'S NOT ZERO SO. THERE'S A LOT THAT CAN BE DONE HERE. AND FOR MOST OF PEOPLE I'VE INTERACTED WITH WITH DISABILITIES THAT JOB THAT ABILITY TO WORK. EVEN AT NOT EXPECTED PRODUCTIVITY LEVEL. WHICH AGAIN IS A POTENTIAL PATH TO A FALSE CHOICE. THE PRICE THEY GET FOR DOING THAT WORK THE DIGNITY GET FOR DOING THAT WORK AND ENGAGEMENT IS WHAT IS MOST SIGNIFICANT. AND IF WHAT WE'RE GOING TO SAY IS THE STANDARD. FOR SOMEONE DISABILITIES IS THE SAME AS SOMEONE WITHOUT DISABILITIES WE END UP WITH THOSE FOLKS CHOICES. SO WE HAVE TO COME TO AN ERROR IT SOME OF THE THESE LAWS GO BACK TO IT AS WE HAVE BEEN SATED FDR. AND YES WESTLEY JUST BROKE. THE LAW SEVEN YEARS AGO THAT DIDN'T SEEM TO MOVE THE NEEDLE UNEMPLOYMENT SO SOMETHING HAS TO CHANGE IT THIS IS A GOOD STEP AND A GOOD RECOGNITION. OF WHAT THAT CHANGE REALLY NEEDS TO BE A PROVIDING SOME ADDITIONAL DIGNITY BECAUSE I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT SOMEBODY WHO IS DOING WORK IN AN ORGANIZATION. THAT IS BEING PAID. SUB MINIMUM WAGE AND REMEMBER WE'RE ACTUALLY NOT TALKING ABOUT SUB MINIMUM CALIFORNIA WAY. FEDERAL WAGE WHICH IS STILL SEVEN DOLLARS AND FIFTY CENTS ABOUT. A LOT OF THESE FOLKS PERFORMING THESE JOBS. ARE GETTING SUB. MINIMUM WAGE WELL BELOW WHAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THIS LEGISLATURE WE WANT TO GIVE GET PEOPLE AWAY. AND IN ANY ORGANIZATION THERE ARE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF PRODUCTIVITY. SO WE CAN'T BE SAYING BECAUSE WE DON'T VALUE YOU YOU'RE ALLOWED TO HAVE SOME MINIMUM WAGE AND THAT'S ULTIMATELY WHAT'S GOING ON HERE. BUT TAKE A DEEP BREATH. TAKE A STEP BACK. AND APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE DOING AND I KNOW CENTER YOU'RE WORKING WITH THE CHAIR AND WITH THIS COMMITTEE BECAUSE WHAT WE- OUR PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY IN THIS AREA THANK. IS TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE TRANSITION WE ARE WHERE WE ARE. GIVEN THE HISTORY OF FEDERAL LAWS AND STATE LAWS IN IT AND OTHER ATTEMPTS. WHERE WE WANT TO BE I THINK IT'S VERY CLEAR AND I AGREE WITH YOU THAT A LOT OF YOUR TIME TWO YEARS. BECAUSE GIVING PEOPLE. DIGNITY IS THE WORK. BUT IS ALSO RECOGNITION WITHIN OUR CURRENT STRUCTURE OF HOW WE VALUE THE WORK THAT'S THE MINIMUM WAGE AND WE HAVE DONE THAT. THE CROSS THE BORDER WE HAVE RATCHETED THAT UP APPROPRIATELY. RECOGNIZING WHAT IT COSTS TO LIVE AND TO WORK IN CALIFORNIA SO WHAT I'M HOPING AND I KNOW WE DON'T HAVE. AMENDMENTS HERE BUT I'VE BEEN TALKING TO COMMITTEE BEHIND INTO. THAT SOME OF YOUR SUPPORTERS SAID AND YOUR SPONSORS A NUMBER OF FOLKS TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THIS AND THERE'S A POTENTIAL I KNOW YOU'RE TALKING TO THEM ABOUT IT AND THAT'S WHAT I'M ASKING IS WE HAVE TO BE RESPONSIBLE. TO THAT TRANSITION AND I GET WORRIED WHEN THERE ARE CLIFFS THAT GET BUILT IN. WITHOUT ANY ANSWER WE'RE STILL WAITING THIS COMMITTEE WITH THEY'RE BUILT ON A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO IN THE CONTINUE OF CARE REFORM DIFFERENT SUBJECT BUT STILL WITHIN JURISDICTIONS COMMITTEE. GETTING DEPARTMENT TO DO GAP ANALYSIS. THAT WAS DUE BY A CERTAIN DAY WE STILL DON'T HAVE IT REXY TAKING. ACTION ON SOME OF THOSE GAPS WITHOUT THE HELP THAT HELPS HAVE BEEN DONE FINE WORK WE ARE MAKING PROGRESS AND I WANNA SEE IS MAKING PROGRESS HERE. SO I THINK WE HAVE TO. UV BEYOND WHAT APPEARS TO BE. A ZERO SUM. IT ULTIMATELY FALLS CHOICES. AND REALLY SET UP. SUCCESS HERE. IN A WAY THAT GETS EVERYBODY COMFORTABLE I WOULD RATHER SEE THE PLAN. BEFORE FINAL ACTION GETS TAKEN. SO ALL I'M ASKING IS THAT YOU'RE WORKING WITH COMMITTEE STAFF HERE AND I'M HOPING THIS BILL MOVES OUT AND THAT'S FINE. BECAUSE WE HAVE OTHER OPPORTUNITIES IN APPROACH FROM THE FLOOR. TO GET THIS RIGHT BECAUSE IF WE DON'T. SET UP THAT TRANSITION PROCESS AND APPROPRIATE WAY. IT'S HARD TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. AND I DON'T BUY INTO THE FEAR ABOUT THE CLIFF BECAUSE A LOT OF THESE JOBS B. 14% YEARS AGO AREN'T. WORKING THE WAY WE WOULD HAVE INTENDED SO LET'S MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE WORKING GET THE BENEFIT OF THAT WORK. AT THE WAGES WE EXPECT THEM TO GET. THAT'S FAIR THAT'S EQUITABLE THAT'S JUST. BUT BECAUSE WE ARE TRANSITIONING FROM ONE STEP TO THE NEXT I'M JUST ASKING THAT YOU WORK WITH THE CMMITTEE AND MAKE SURE THAT THAT WE UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT TRANSITION IS. AND THAT WE DON'T. TO PERPETUATE THE- THE CURRENT NARRATIVE OF THIS TWO ZERO SUM. ENVIRONMENT BECAUSE IT'S REALLY NOT THAT SIMPLE YES IT'S COMPLICATED. BUT WE NEED AND THAT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE COGNIZANT OF WHAT THAT TRANSITION IS. AND THAT WE'RE BRINGING EVERYONE ALONG. TO HELP MANAGE THE- THESE PEOPLE WHO ARE VALUABLE TO US IN OUR COMMUNITY THE WORK THAT THEY DO. THE LIFE EXPERIENCE THAT THEY GET IN THE BENEFIT THAT THE GET FROM ANY VARIOUS LEVELS OF EMPLOYMENT OR INTERNSHIPS OR- ANY OF THESE POSSIBILITIES SO THAT'S- WHAT I WANT TO MAKE SURE OF- I'M SUPPORTING IT TODAY ABSOLUTELY AND I AGREE WITH WHAT YOU'RE WITH WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO. I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE WE'RE TRANSITIONING APPROPRIATE. OKAY THANK YOU SOMEONE AND SOMEONE BRENT DID YOU THE QUESTION. I'M SORRY SIX SEVEN CALLS MY FIRST DAY COMMITTEE. I APPRECIATE ALL OF THE TESTIMONY TODAY I HAVE FOUR SIBLINGS OF SPECIAL NEEDS INCLUDING A LITTLE BROTHER WITH CEREBRAL PALSY- AND I THINK THERE ARE A LOT OF IMPORTANT VALUES AT STAKE IN THIS BILL. ONE OF THEM IS THAT WE DON'T DISCRIMINATE ON IMMUTABLE CHARACTERISTICS WE DON'T PAY MEN LAST BECAUSE WOMEN ARE MORE PRODUCTIVE. MY WE DON'T PAY WHITE FOLKS LESS BECAUSE PEOPLE OF COLOR MORE PRODUCTIVE. WE DON'T DISCRIMINATE ON IMMUTABLE CHARACTERISTICS AND THAT'S AN IMPORTANT VALUE TO HOLD I THINK. MY COLLEAGUE ALSO MENTION THAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT PAYING BELOW THE FEDERAL MINIMUM WAGE. WHICH IS LESS THAN HALF OF WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS THE STATE MINIMUM WAGE CURRENTLY. ABOUT WORKERS RIGHTS. AND IT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT. WHEN I APPRECIATE WHAT I APPRECIATE ABOUT THIS BILL AND LIKE TO THINK THAT AUTHORS IT IT'S ABOUT DEVELOPING A PLAN. IT'S ABOUT SITTING WITH STAKEHOLDERS ABOUT A MULTI YEAR PHASE OUT IT'S ABOUT PROTECTING THE TWELVE THOUSAND FOLKS IN THESE JOBS AND DOING IT IN A THOUGHTFUL- INSINCERE WAY- BUT NOT AT THE EXPENSE OF NOT SETTING A HARD RULE THAT BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE WE'VE GOT TO PAY PEOPLE FAIR. AND SO I WOULD LIKE TO BE A PART OF THAT PLANNING A PART OF THINKING THAT THE WRITING THIS ENTIRE COMMITTEE SHOULD BE THINK. ALL OF THE STAKEHOLDERS IN THIS ROOM NEED TO BE A PART OF THAT PLAN BECAUSE WE ALL WANT TO MAKE SURE. THAT THE TWELVE THOUSAND PEOPLE WITH THESE JOBS KEEP.

SOMEONE BRENT- MY FIRST HOME AFTER BEING BORN WAS A FOSTER HOME AND THEN IT WAS ADOPTED BY A FAMILY THAT DID FOSTER CARE FOR TWENTY SIX YEARS HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF THESE GOING UP AND I JUST WANT TO COMMEND THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR CO AUTHORS I WOULD BE HAPPY TO JOIN I THINK THIS IS AN IMPORTANT PRIORITY FOR CALIFORNIA AND I'M PROUD TO BE SITTING ON THIS COMMITTEE TODAY LOOKING AT THIS BILL SO THANK. ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD BE HONORED TO HAVE YOU ON BOARD AS CO AUTHOR. THANK YOU. HER QUESTION GO AHEAD. THE SENATE TO PUT THIS ON I WONDER I VSO UNIVERSE ONLINE BUSY OF ALL ONCE A DOLLAR SO IT WOULD BE- GIVEN ALL THE FOR THOSE SO. A CATEGORY REGARDLESS OF THEIR- INCOME AT THAT TIME. IT CAN YOU REPEAT THAT THE QUESTION. OKAY ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS WILL BE GIVEN OUT TO OR THE FOSTER CHILDREN- THERE ARE- YEAH IN THE EXTENDED THE FOSTER CARE PROGRAM REGARDLESS OF WHAT THEIR INCOME. YES THIS IS AND RIGHT THIS IS THIS IS ESSENTIALLY- AZAR EMANCIPATED THE ROLE LONGER THEY NO LONGER QUALIFY FOR EXTENDED FOSTER CARE- AND AT THAT POINT. THEY'RE BASICALLY ON THEIR OWN WITHOUT FAMILY SUPPORT- LIKE A LOT OF NON FOSTER NON CHILD WELFARE- CHILDREN HAVE A BILL DO NOT ALL BUT MANY DO- BUT IT IS REGARDLESS OF INCOME. AND IT'S PERSON PURPOSELY NOT PRESCRIPTIVE IN THAT REGARD WE HAVE FOSTER YOUTH WHO HAVE LITTLE OR NO INCOME BUT OUR STUDENTS- PERHAPS- THEY ARE STUDENTS IN NEED. TO MAKE A DECISION TO USE. THE DOLLAR SLUMPED TO SUPPORT THEIR EDUCATION IN SOME MANNER OF BOOKS. COULD BE THAT THERE ARE- THEY DON'T NEED HELP WITHOUT THE NEED HELP WITH HOUSING THE ROOM TO RENT A ROOM. OF MONEY TO RENT A ROOM COULD BE THAT THEY HAVE A ROOM- AND THEY HAVE. OTHER EDUCATION GOING ALONG FINE ON A SCHOLARSHIP OR SOME OTHER WAY BUT THE- THEY'RE HAVING. ANXIETY AROUND FOOD AND NUTRITION ISSUES AND THEY NEED THE MONEY FOR THAT SO IT'S PURPOSELY- AN AUGMENTATION OBVIOUSLY NOT A LOT OF MONEY WITH AN AUGMENTATION- TO THEIR BASIC INCOME- TO VOTE FOR THEM TO NOT ONLY BE EMPOWERED. TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT BUT ALSO TO GIVE THEM THE LATITUDE- IN A NON PRESCRIPTIVE WAY- TO NOT ONLY MAKE THE DECISION THAT THEY NEED TO MAKE BUT TO PUT THE MONEY IN THE RIGHT. PLACE BASED ON THEIR CIRCUMSTANCES. THANK HAS. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER I THINK IT MOMENT IN THIS THIRD. THROUGH THE CHAIR MAN. SENATOR THANK YOU VERY MUCH I THINK THAT'S MIKE IS A I'VE BEEN BIG OF A FOR FOSTER SYSTEM AND FOSTER CARE MY CONCERN IS WITH- THE THOUSAND DOLLARS MAKING SURE THAT YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S USED FOR THE RIGHT PURPOSE SO YOU TALK ABOUT THAT YOU KNOW WHAT ABOUT PERHAPS THINKING. GREAT YOU NEVER GONNA GIVE THIS THOUSAND DOLLARS AND YOU COULD PUT IT TOWARDS YOUR HOUSING YOU COULD PORTED TOWARDS YOUR BOOKS YOU CAN PUT IT TOWARDS YOU KNOW PAYING YOUR INSURANCE BUT THERE'S A PLACE LIKE A CATEGORY OR SOMETHING. BECAUSE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS IS ACTUALLY GOING TO BE UTILIZED WHERE WHERE IT NEEDS TO BE AND YOU KNOW WITH GOOD FAITH OF THE ASSUMING GOING WHERE WE'RE GOING TO EXPECT THESE PEOPLE TO KNOW. YOU KNOW WHAT WHEN YOU'RE GROWING UP EVEN WHEN YOU'RE IN YOUR EARLY TWENTIES WHETHER YOU'RE AT A FOSTER HOME YOU'RE NOT. THEY'RE NOT TAUGHT THE SKILLS SOMETIMES A REALLY KNOWING WE IN A WIDE COMMONSENSE WE REALLY SHOULD BE PUTTING IN HERE TO A GIRL LITTLE BIT OLDER WE REALIZE. OKAY I SHOULD SAVE MY MONEY OR PAY MY BILLS FIRST BEFORE I GO IN I HAVE FUN. SO I THINK THAT'S JUST IT I. IT'S NOT THE MONEY. IT'S JUST MAKING IT SO THAT YOU KNOW THEY HAVE OPTIONS% AND GOOD CHOICES FOR DOUBTS OF THE UNDERSTAND THAT'S HOW YOU TRAIN THEM. GOING GREAT THIS IS A GREAT PLACE I'M GONNA PUT IT. TOWARDS A HOUSING ART. TO TBILISI OR MAYBE IT'S A CAR. YOU KNOW IN MAKING A PAYMENT BUT IF WE GIVE THEM- COMMONSENSE OPTIONS TO PUT THE MONEY IN WE COULD SEE THE MONEY'S BEING USED. YOU KNOW RIGHT. I THINK THAT'S MY ONLY CONCERN IS THAT IT'S REALLY UP TO THEIR DISCRETION. AND THAT WE COULD HELP THEM ALONG EDUCATE THEM AS WELL. AND HOW TO BE- YOU KNOW. WHEN IT COMES FINANCES BEING GOOD YOU KNOW BE LIKEGOOD IDEAS GOOD LEADERS WHEN IT COMES FINANCES. WELL ONE THING SETS. BACK IN. BILL FINALLY RE. THINGS OF BUILT IN. OF THE- IS OF. THE VSS WILL. WILL WORK- WITHOUT PRESCRIBING A TO WORK TO MAKE AVAILABLE. OF CREDIT COUNSELING FINANCIAL COUNSELING MENTORSHIP. OF NUMBER PROGRAMS. PART OF THOSE IDEAS CAME. YOU KNOW WERE INCUBATED- AT THE COUNTY LEVEL WHERE IT'S EASIER TO TEST THOSE THINGS. WITHOUT REQUIRING IT. BECAUSE THE THOUGHT HEARING THERE IS A PHILOSOPHY IN A- I WILL KNOWLEDGE SAID. SOME MAY NOT BUY INTO IT OR NOT BUY INTO IT YET- THAT WHAT WE HAVE DONE FOR YEARS AND YEARS. IS TRIED TO BE VERY VERY PRESCRIPTIVE. WITH SOCIAL SERVICE- WITH SOCIAL SERVICES- WITH THIS POPULATION. AND WE FAIL- 50% OF THEM ARE NOT GRADUATING. HIGH SCHOOL SO NOW. THEY'RE LAUNCHING INTO THIS. THIS ERA OF EMANCIPATION WITHOUT EVEN. A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA OR THOSE SKILLS THAT THEY NEED. WE THEN SAY. LOOK WE DON'T WANT YOU HOMELESS. SO WE'LL GIVE YOU A HOUSING VOUCHER BUT THEY DON'T ALL NEED A HOUSING VOUCHER SOME DO AND SOME DON'T. IT'S OF THE DANGER. EVEN THOUGH I UNDERSTAND. YOU ARE SORT OF SUGGESTING. A FAIRLY. LENGTHY LIST. HI HERE YOU RIGHT AS TO. WHAT SUITABLE. EXPENDITURES ARE- AT SOME POINT YOU. RUN THE RISK OF ESSENTIALLY. TOM UP AS THESE AS A STAY IN THESE CHILL- THE YOU KNOW AS SAYING WE KNOW EXACTLY. WHAT ISGOING TO SORT OF DELIVER YOU THROUGH TRANSITION USE THE MONEY THIS WAY AND NOT ANOTHER WAY. IN OF COURSE WE DON'T REALLY DO THAT- SUCCESSFULLY. YOU KNOW WITH MUCH OF OUR- QUOTE WELFARE SYSTEM OR SOCIAL SERVICE SYSTEM WITH THAT. BY AND LARGE ARE SICK OUR EFFORTS TO TRY TO DICTATE TO PEOPLE HOW THEY SHOULD LIVE THEIR LIVES. YOU DON'T HAVE BEEN A FAILURE IN THIS STATE ACROSS THE COUNTRY SO THIS IS SOMETHING DIFFERENT IT'S SAYING- YOU YOU MAKE YOUR DECISIONS. BUT LIKE ADULTS WAS GONNA WORK A 100% THE TIME WITH EVERYONE WITHOUT MISTAKES NO BUT- WE DON'T HAVE MUCH OF A HIGH BAR RIGHT NOW- TO BEAT OR TO- TO REACH IN IN TERMS OF DOING BETTER THAN WE'RE ALREADY DOING. IN IN THE BEST EVIDENCE THAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW IS THE SANTA CLARA COUNTY MALL DIDN'T DO ANYTHING TO SKEW THE RESULTS SEVENTY TWO FOSTER YOUTH. I THINK THAT ONE DROP OUT FOR GOOD REASON THE REST OF THEM- AFTER EUROPE ALL BEEN EVALUATED. WITH INDICATORS- PRESENT THAT THE BASED ON PREVIOUS BASELINE POPULATIONS OF STATE OUT OF INCARCERATION OF MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES HAVE NOT DROPPED OUT OF SCHOOL AND ARE NOT HOMELESS SO. IT SEEMS TO BE WORKING THIS IS A PILOT TWO ONE EMPHASIZE THAT FOR THOSE WHO ARE CONCERNED WHAT IF IT DOESN'T WORK ON A STATEWIDE LEVEL WELL. I THINK WILL BE SUNSETTING- THE PROGRAM NOBODY'S GONNA WANT TO RENEW THE PROGRAM AT SUNSET AT THAT POINT I THINK THAT'S THE REAL SAFEGUARD. ULTIMATELY TO THE- TO THE CONCERNS THAT YOU'RE RAISING ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND I DO APPRECIATE THE CONCERNS AND I DO AND I UNDERSTAND IT'S A THREE YEAR PILOT PROGRAM. IS THERE ANY WAY OF JUST YOU KNOW KEEPING TRACK BUT AFTER YEAR- INSTEAD OF WAITING FOR THREE YEARS AND IT REALLY YOU KNOW IT IF THERE'S A PLACE OF SAYING VERY WHERE DID YOU PUT YOU KNOW BECAUSE THIS IS A GREAT STUDY PROGRAM WHERE IS IT THAT YOU DID. YOU KNOW PLACE YUR BODY IT GET IF IT'S UP TO THEIR DISCRETION THERE SHOULD BE A PROBLEM LET US KNOW YOU KNOW WHERE YOU'RE PUTTING IT. IN IN THERE IS A VALUATION BUILT IN IN THERE IS VALUATION AT THE ONE YOUR POINT- YEAH AND ALTHOUGH. WHAT I'M SAYING ABOUT BEING NON PRESCRIPTIVE SOUNDS LIKE MAYBE WE ARE GOING TO EVALUATE THERE IS A DIFFERENCE WE WILL EVALUATE. IS SO THE IDEA OF NOT TELLING SOMEONE SPECIFICALLY WHETHER TO BUY SHOES OR BUY FOOD. IS WHAT WE WANT. BUT IT'S STILL OKAY TO ASKING AT THE END OF THE YEAR DID YOU BUY SHOES OR DID YOU BUY FOOD AND SO. WE'LL HAVE THOSE DATA POINTS ONE THE BEAUTIFUL THING ABOUT THIS POPULATION. IF YOU WERE EVER GOING TO DO. YOU BE I. WITH THE POPULATION- IT WOULD BE THIS. BECAUSE WE HAVE A LIFETIME. OF AGGREGATED AND DISAGGREGATED DATA ON THEM ALREADY IN OUR COUNTY SYSTEMS. SO YOU. YOU YOU WERE ABLE TO TAKE THIS ONE YOUR POINT. ND HOPEFULLY A SECOND THIRD YOUR POINT IF THE PROGRAM- IS APPROVED FOR THREE YEARS AND FUNDED FOR THREE YEARS. AND REALLY- AND REALLY- DO NOT ONLY AN EVALUATION BUT IN ALL THE VALUATION RELATIVE TO WHAT KIND OF RESULTS THE SYSTEM IS PRODUCED IN THE PAST ON ON THE SAME USE FOR THAT MATTER. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE THEM. I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. AND. WE HAVE A MOTION BY ITS CINNAMON ARAMBULA AND A SECOND BY ASSEMBLY MEMBRANE. THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE ASSEMBLY APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE CALDERON HI WALDRON I'D DAVIES. DAVIES NOT VOTING ARAMBULA RYAN I AND I ACTUALLY CHOI AYE STONE STONE I'D LOVE TO DO THAT THE DUBAI WARD. OKAY RIDLEY. CAN WILL GET FIVE VOTES FOR EVEN OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS. CENTRE HER TADO THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE. YOU READY TO PRESENT ON SBONE OH EIGHT. YES I. ASSEMBLY WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. OKAY WELL THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS TODAY I'M HERE TO PRESENT SB ONE ZERO EIGHT THE HUMAN RIGHT TO FOOD ACT. COLLEAGUES WE ARE ON THE ROAD. WE ARE ON THE VERGE OF A FOOD CRISIS. A THIRD OF GLOBAL PRODUCTION IS AT RISK DUE TO CLIMATE CHANGE ALONE AND ENERGY MAKES UP 19% OF THE AMERICAN FOOD SUPPLY CHAIN. WITH INCREASING PRICES AND ENERGY WERE ALSO SEEN FOOD COST INCREASE. IN CALIFORNIA WE'RE FACING A DROUGHT THAT IS ALREADY PUTTING FOOD OUT OF PRODUCTION. I LET'S NOT FORGET DISEASE CROP DISEASES NOT ONLY A THREAT TO OUR FOOD. BUT IT'S ALSO TO OUR OWN HEALTH. JUST LIKE THE COVER NINETEEN PANDEMIC WE ARE UNPREPARED FOR A FOOD CRISIS WE NEED FOOD RESILIENCE AND ADAPTIVE CAPACITY BECAUSE FOOD IS HEALTH AND FOOD IS LIFE. CALIFORNIA NOT ONLY FEEDS THE STATE WE FEED THE WORLD THE WORLD IS RELYING ON CALIFORNIA TO KEEP MANKIND FOOD SECURE. TODAY AS AND TODAY IT IS IMPORTANT AS IT IS AS IT WILL BE TOMORROW. AS CALIFORNIA'S POPULATION GROWS AS THE CLIMATE GETS WARMER AND AS LAND USAGE CHANGES OUR ABILITY TO KEEP PACE AND FEED THE RESIDENTS OF THE STATE WILL BE CHALLENGED. WE MUST PREPARE FOR THESE CHALLENGES AND THAT'S WHY I'M INTRODUCING SB ONE ZERO EIGHT. SB ONE ZERO EIGHT REQUIRE STATE AGENCIES TO CONSIDER THE HUMAN RIGHT TO FOOD AS A CREATE AMEND OR ADOPT REGULATIONS BUT IT ALSO REQUIRES A REPORT ON THE CURRENT AND FUTURE STATUS OF FOOD. FOOD PRODUCTION AND FOOD ASSISTANCE SB ONE ZERO EIGHT DECLARES IT THE ESTABLISHED POLICY OF CALIFORNIA THAT EVERY HUMAN BEING HAS THE RIGHT TO ACCESS TO EFFICIENT HEALTHY AND AFFORDABLE FOOD. WE MUST MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE IN OUR STATE ARE FED NOW AND IN THE FUTURE. AND S. B. ONE ZERO EIGHT WORKS TOWARDS THAT END TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL I HAVE. DAVID GUEST FROM THE BRIDE OF THE WORLD AND PAULA PS BECAUSE FROM THE COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION. THANK YOU SENATOR OPERATOR CAN YOU PLEASE OPEN THE LINE FOR THE WITNESSES. PLANTER OPEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. DID YOU DID YOU GET DID YOU LIKE THE WORKERS YES SIR. THANK YOU WELL AS MISUNDERSTOOD I'M DAVID AND I'M NOT SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF BREAKING THE WORLD'S THE WORLD IS A NETWORK OF CHURCHES AND PASTORS AND COMMUNITY LEADERS AROUND THE COUNTRY AND HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND MEMBERS WE WORK WITH OVER THREE THOUSAND CHURCHES UNITED IN CALLING FOR A RIGHT TO IT AND TO WORK WITH ELECTED LEADERS TO END HUNGER. SO WHAT ARE YOU KNOW I MEAN HUNGER HAS QUADRUPLED DURING THE PANDEMIC. AND WHEN WE RECOGNIZE THAT THE HELPFROM DEMOCRATS FOSTERED EIGHT HUNDRED PANDEMIC. ONE WE UNDERSTAND HUNGER AND FOOD INSECURITY AS PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES. AND SECURING THE RIGHT TO ACCESS TO EFFICIENT AFFORDABLE AND HEALTHY FOOD WITH DIGNITY. BECOMES A MORAL AND ECONOMIC IMPERATIVE. SPREE PANDEMIC HUNGER INCLUDED SECURITY COSTS THE US ECONOMY OVER A ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY BILLION DOLLARS IN POOR HEALTH OUTCOMES AN ADDITIONAL HEALTHCARE. AND I WAS PRETTY CONDEMNING. CALIFORNIA LOST ONE POINT FIVE MILLION JOBS THE PANDEMIC AND HUNGER HAS SPIKED IN MANY COMMUNITIES. FOR EXAMPLE FOOD BANK IN ALAMEDA SERVICE FIFTY TO SIXTY FAMILY TODAY CREE PANDEMIC BUT REACHED SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY TO EIGHT HUNDRED AND FIFTY FAMILIES TODAY DURING LAST SUMMER WHEN CONGRESS HIGHER WITH KIDS NOT IN SCHOOL. WE BRIEFLY GOING TO WHERE THE FEDERAL. PROGRAM THAT INVEST IN MOTHERS AND YOUNG CHILDREN STUDY AFTER STUDY HAS SHOWN WHAT IT COULD BE QUITE COST EFFECTIVE BY INVESTING IN IMPROVING. NUTRITION AND HEALTH FOR LOW INCOME FAMILIES WHICH LEADS TO BETTER PUBLIC HEALTH AND HIGHER ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT IN SCHOOLS. I BELIEVE SB ONE OH EIGHT WILL PROVE AS COST EFFECTIVE AS WELL. BY HELPING HER STAY BECOME HEALTHIER AND MORE ROBUST ECONOMICALLY IN THE MONTHS AND YEARS TO COME AS WE RECOVER FROM THE PANDEMIC. THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT. ARE AFFECTS A GROWING NUMBER OF CALIFORNIANS BEFORE TOO MANY OF THEM ARE CHILDREN. CALIFORNIANS NEED THE STATE TO SET A STANDARD OF A RIGHT TO FOOD AND S. B. ONE AWAITS. RIGHT TO SUE THAT CAN BE THAT STANDARD. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU MISTER CHEST. WE HAVE MISS SMITH ONLINE.

THE INSIDER MUSTA GUARANTEE THAT TIME VIçT THE PERSON- WHO'S GONNA BE ALLOWED. TO FOR- TEN MILLION IMMIGRATION WON'T BE CALM THE PUBLIC CHARGING FOR FIVE YEARS.

WE DO HAVE- UNFORTUNATELY A LOT OF WORK. EIGHTY NINE IS WITH THE NORTH DOCUMENTATION. AND ARE YOU MAY I'M SURE NO 100% EVERY DAY I'VE DONE ON THE CHANNEL. NEWS CHANNELS SO. THIS COUNTRIES ARE STRUGGLING BUT THE DRILL IN THE SOUTHERN BORDER- WITH THE OPEN BORDER- MANY MANY PEOPLE ARE. ATTEMPTING TO CROSS ALL BORDERS. SO I'M SO AFRAID. THIS BILL IS SO. ENCOURAGING.

OBLONG IN THIS COUNTRY PARTICULARLY IN THIS AGE NASA FEW MONTHS AGO. SEVERAL HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE TRIED TO CROSS OUR BORDER. JUST BECAUSE ALL OF ALL. THE BEER IS A SIMILAR TO THIS SO REGARDLESS OF IMMIGRATION STATUS SO ORDER ORDER FEED YOU IS JUST TELL YOU EDUCATE YOU. HOSPITALIZE YOU A CERTAIN SUCH A SOUL YOUR P. R. COMPOUND THE PROBLEM SO HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT THAT THE NEGATIVE IMPACT THAT THIS YOUR BILL WILL MAKE. FOR THE PROBLEM THAT THAT THIS NATION IS SOFT FACING. THE BANK TONIGHT LOOK GREAT CRESCENTA YOU'RE RAISING THE CONCERN AND IF I MAY I WANT TO. SHARE WITH YOU I KNOW YOU MENTIONED THAT- YOUR FIRST GENERATION HERE AND AMERICA AND I'M FIRST GENERATION HERE IN AMERICA TOO MY PARENTS CAME FROM THE STATE OF SAN LUIS POTOSI AND THE STATE AND OFFER MEXICO AND THEY LEFT BECAUSE- THEY WERE ALSO FACING THE DROPPED. AT THAT TIME THEY WERE FACING. POVERTY THEY WERE FACING LACK OF ACCESS TO FOOD AND WHAT DO YOU DO. WHEN YOU'RE IN THAT KIND OF SITUATION. HE TRIED TO GO AND SEARCH FOR A PLACE. THAT PROVIDE SOME SENSE OF SECURITY FOR YOURSELF AND FOR YOUR FAMILY AND- YOU KNOW THE REALITY IS THAT THAT- WITH THE CHALLENGES THAT WE'RE FACING HERE TODAY AT AMERICA AND REALLY OF THE WORLD- I AM A CHANGES BOOKED ABOUT IT EARLIER. WE COULD BE. YOU KNOW- MIGRANTS HERSELF. WE COULD BE MOVING WE COULD BE. IN THAT NEED AND SHOULD WE BE DENIED ACCESS TO FOOD BECAUSE WE'RE TRYING TO ESCAPE AND PROVIDE A BETTER OPPORTUNITY FOR OURSELVES AND- TRYING TO SURVIVE. I MEAN REALLY IT'S A IT'S A MORAL QUESTION I'M FOR ME THOUGHT. THE MORAL QUESTION AS- THIS IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO. NO ONE SHOULD BE DENIED FOR THAT YEAH THAT'S THE REASON I STATED I STRUGGLE WITH YOUR B. L. AND- EVEN THOUGH THE CHAIN. TENONTOSAURUS DAHLE HUNGER PROBLEM UNFORTUNATELY. IRAN DO YOU THINK AMERICA CAN- FEED THE ENTIRE WORLD ANYONE HUNGRY CAN COME OVER AND FEED YOU I KNOW THEY ARE ENTITLED TO DATE THEY SHOULD NOT. BE HUNGRY THEY SHOULD BE SHELTERED AND THE FED. TO THAT DOCTOR DOES STORIES ON YOUR BASIC KERR. OUT RIGHT TO FOOD. SB OUT ONE OH EIGHT THE- ENCOMPASSES AT THAT ONE I CAN AGREE UPON BUT THIS PROGRAM IS A SUBJECT SPECIFICALLY ENCOURAGING. MORE ILLEGAL ENDURANCE A TO THIS COUNTRY AND THAT THAT WOULD COMPOUND THE OUR NATION'S A PROBLEM THAT'S TO MY AS A NON LEGAL CITIZEN OF THIS COUNTRY I'M CONCERNED FOR MY COUNTRY. I BUT YOU KNOW WHAT- I RESPECT YOUR OPINION BUT YOU KNOW FOR ME IT'S A MATTER OF A MORAL QUESTION AND LIKE I SAID WE'RE FREDDIE WERE FACING THE GREATEST THREAT OF OUR LIFETIME WHICH IS CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE REALITY IS THAT WE'RE ALL GOING TO BE IMPACTED BY FOR. YOU KNOW FOR- OUR FOOD SCARCITY RIGHT AND- AND I THINK THAT WE NEED TO DO A BETTER JOB OF BEING. COMPASSIONATE AND UNDERSTANDING AND- YOU KNOW HELPING ONE ANOTHER OUT DURING A CRISIS TO SURVIVE AND- THIS BILL DOES ACT ON IT IT A LOT IT ALLOWS. US TO PROVIDE. AN OPPORTUNITY TO INDIVIDUAL TO SURVIVE IT'S ASKING IF IT'S GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO A CHILD TO A MOTHER TO A FATHER. TO SOMEONE LIKE MY PARENTS- WHO JUST WANTED AN OPPORTUNITY AND THAT'S I THINK THE MOST IMMIGRANTS- WANT. AN OPPORTUNITY THEY DON'T WANT TO HAND OUT NOBODY SHOULD BE THERE IN A PART OF THE SHOULD BE THE STANDARD FOR. IT'S A BETTER LIFE THIS IS THIS IS TO HELP LIFT FAMILIES OUT OF POVERTY AND- I HOPE IT CAN CONVINCE YOU AT SOME POINT TO SUPPORT THIS LEGISLATION I WAS THERE WHEN I WAS GOING TO SCHOOL. DURING THE SUMMERTIME I WAS HUNGRY I HAD NO MONEY. SO I HAD TO GET A JOB AS A DISHWASHER JUST TO EAT AT THE RESTAURANT. IF I WASH THE DISHES SO I'M SURE THEY WILL FEED MISSILE. IN NEW YORK CITY WITH DUST DUST AWAY I SURVIVE. AND THE SAVED A FEW DOLLARS DOLLAR SO AND FINISHED MY MASTER'S DEGREE. AND DISOWN SO. THERE IS SO- HUMANISTIC. OUR SIDE OF OUR EMOTION ATTACHED HERE BUT THE. THE DOG CRASHES SO THAT THAT THIS NATION IS SO CREATING ARE WEARE INVITING DID THIS BILL IS SO STIMULATING MORE ILLEGAL ALIENS IN THIS COUNTRY THAT THAT THIS IS A BIG PROBLEM.

I WANT TO BE CLEAR I'M NOT OPPOSED TO WE HAVE CONCERNS- KIMBERLY ROSENBERGER WITH SEIU- WE THINK- THE AUTHOR IN THE INTENT OF THIS BILL IS WONDERFUL WE DO YOU HAVE A CHILD CARE CRISIS- ESPECIALLY FOR INFANTS HOWEVER- IT THERE THERE'S NOT PARITY THERE WERE A LITTLE CONCERNED WITH THE UNINTENDED UNINTENDED A FACT THAT IT WILL HAVE. ON OUR CHILD CARE PROVIDERS WHO TRADITIONALLY DO THE ZERO TO THREE AND- ARE ALREADY FACING A LITTLE BIT OF INSTABILITY CAUSED BY THE UNIVERSAL TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN PROPOSAL THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO HELP WITH THAT IS STREAMLINED THINGS WITH WE DO APPRECIATE BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE FULL PARITY. THERE ISN'T PARITY WHEN IT COMES TO INTER AND INTRA TRANSFERS THERE ISN'T PARITY IN THE STREAMLINING ACCESS FOR SCHOOLS I HAVE 80% OR MORE FOR YOUR REDUCE CHILDREN WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT FOR OUR FAMILY CARE PROVIDERS. I WOULD LIKE THEM THE SAME OPPORTUNITY AND THEN WITH ALL THINGS THAT ARE ARE SYSTEMICALLY CHANGING- AN INFRASTRUCTURE LIKE THIS WE DO THINK THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE A SUNSET- WE ARE RECOMMENDING A SUNSET THAT ALIGNS WITH GIVING THEM A COUPLE CYCLES THROUGH CONTRACTS SO WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE AN EVALUATION AFTER THE FIRST CYCLE AND THEN WITH THE SECOND CYCLE WE CAN COME BACK RETURN. SEE WHAT WORKS AND WHAT DOESN'T AND ALLOW- YOU KNOW STAKEHOLDERS TO HAVE IN PLACE WE ARE WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR AS WELL AS THE SPONSORS BUT WE'RE IN THE SECOND HOUSE THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF THINGS CHANGING AND WE JUST FEEL- WE NEED TO REALLY HAMMER OUT SOME MORE DETAILS AROUND. HOW THE IMPACT IS GOING. TO BE ON OUR PROVIDERS BEEN KILLED. THANK YOU. I DO WE HAVE ANY- PUBLIC OPPOSITION RTS ROOM. NO OKAY OPERATOR DO WE HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL PUBLIC OPPOSITION ON THE LINE. COMMENTS IN OPPOSITION TO SB FIFTY PLEASE PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO THAT COMMAND AGAIN ONE THEN. ZERO AND WE HAVE NO COMMENT AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU OPERATOR- DO WE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FOR THE AUTHOR FROM THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS. AND IF SOMEONE TRIED. THANK YOU SENATOR NAME ON- I WILL BE SUPPORTING HIS SO- MANAGER BECAUSE I AM A STRONG BELIEVER OF EARLY LEARNING AND I'M ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT THE- AVAILABILITY OF A CHILD CARE CENTERS- BUT THAT IN. THIS- IMPLEMENTATION- THE SUMMARY. SAYS SO IT SAYS THIS PROGRAM IS EXPANDING THE RANGE OF WHAT TYPE OF A CHILD CARE. AND EARLY LEARNING SERVICES TO THE STATE. OPRY'S QUARTER CONTRACTING AGENCY- CAN YOU DEFINE IN IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS PROGRAM WILL THIS BE- EXPANDED GOT TO EXISTING PUBLIC SCHOOL RISK WHAT. BUY YOU A STATEMENT DOUBLE CONTRACTING AGENCY DOES THAT MEAN THAT OUTSIDE THE CONTRACTOR- WILL IT INCLUDE THE NONPROFIT'S ALL FOR PROFIT SO WHO WILL BE DAHLE CONTRACTING AGENCIES. THAT'S MY FIRST QUESTION AND THEN I ASSUME- THAT ANYONE TWO TO FOUR YEARS OLD DON'T ONE DAY OUT AND ROLLED INTO STATE SPONSORED THAT CHARMED ITSELF. Q. PROGRAMS WILL BE FREE OF CHARGE IS THAT CORRECT SO THE PROGRAM THE IDEA IS THAT WE WOULD EXPAND THIS TO SOME OF THE LICENSED PROVIDERS- THAT CURRENTLY EXIST AND SO WE HOPE THAT THAT SOME OF THE PROVIDERS FOR CHILD CARE NOW WOULD BE INTERESTED IN CONTRACTING WITH THAT WITH THE STATE AT TO EXPAND THIS SERVICE AND SO YES- THE PRESCHOOL THE STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM IS FREE- SUBSIDIZE AND THAT IS OUR HOPE I MEAN I THINK WE ARE WORKING TOWARDS. A MODEL OF MORE AFFORDABILITY AND CERTAINLY THIS BILL- IS FOCUSED ON THE MORE UNDERSERVED- WHO REALLY WANT TO MAKE SURE- ARE ABLE TO ACCESS. A CHILD CARE AND STATE PRESCHOOL. A NOT CREATE SO- MORE CONCERN TO ME- AT LEAST- IN MY- DISTRICT A- THE- CHILD CARE OR- CENTERS ARE NOT SUFFICIENT AND THERE'S ALWAYS A LONG. WAITING LIST AND IF YOU EXPAND- THE THAT THAT THE PROGRAM AGE GROUP TO YOUR TOOL FOR YEARS SO THAT'LL BE OVERWHELMING AND EVEN LONGER- WAITING PERIOD- TO BE ADMITTED. SO HOW CAN WE SOLVE THAT PROBLEM SO IT IS SAID THAT A COUPLE THINGS I'M NOT SURE THAT YOUR- ANALISIS EIGHT IS ONE THAT I SHARE- I IS THAT WHAT HAPPENS IS YOU HAVE A COMBINATION OF THINGS HAPPENING AND ACTUALLY IT WAS JUST SPOKEN TO WE'VE ALSO EXPANDED. THE TIKI PROGRAM RIGHT AND THAT'S HAPPENING- THROUGH BUDGET ACTIONS WE'VE HAD CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THAT SO ALL OF THIS WORKS TOGETHER- AND THE IDEA IS THAT. IF YOU'RE AN AGENCY IF YOU'RE A CENTER- IF YOU'RE HOME HAIR CARE PROVIDER THAT CAN EXPAND THEN YOU ARE A BIG ABLE TO GO REMEMBER THAT THE RULES CHANGE RIGHT SO FOR INFANT CARE THERE ARE CERTAIN GUIDELINES THAT ARE NEEDED FOR TODDLER CARE AND THEN FOR PRESCHOOL AND ALL OF THOSE GUIDELINES ACTUALLY AS THE STUDENTS GET OLDER THE ALLOW FOR MORE FLEXIBILITY. AND THAT'S WHY YOU SEE A HIGHER- STUDENT TO ADULT RATIO AT THE OLDER AGE- AND SO ALL OF THESE THINGS ARE PART OF ANY CREATION- AND YOU WOULDN'T IF YOU WOULD NOT BE IF YOU WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO. MEET THE NEEDS OF THE CONTRACT YOU WOULD THEREFORE NOT APPLY- AS SOMEONE WHO IS HONEST SEVEN WAIT LIST THREE IN SACRAMENTO AND US FOR IN SANTA BARBARA COUNTY I CAN TELL YOU- THAT THIS BILL DOES NOT MAKE THAT PROBLEM ANY BIGGER THAT PROBLEM EXISTS BECAUSE THE OVERALL THING THAT WE NEED TO DO. IS WE NEED TO INCREASE CHILD CARE SLOTS IN ALL AGES RIGHT ESPECIALLY IF THE INFANT SO IF YOU LOOK AT THE YOU KNOW NOW I MAY BE GIVING YOU TOO MUCH DETAIL BUT YOU JUST ASK THE MOTHER OF AN INFANT. ABOUT THIS SO AT THE INFANT LIST IS ACTUALLY THE LONGEST LIST IF THE SO AS THE KIDS GET OLDER AT THAT LIST IS SHORTER. SO I CA GIVE YOU MORE DETAILS IF YOU'D LIKE BUT THE THIS IS DOES NOT EX CREATE LONGER WAIT LIST THIS ACTUALLY EXPANDS THE OPPORTUNITY TO SERVE MORE KIDS THROUGH THE STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM WHICH WOULD POTENTIALLY BE SLIGHTLY OLDER- KIDS AND ALSO I DO WANT TO RECOGNIZE THE IN TERMS OF THE DISCUSSION THAT'S HAPPENED THIS BILL- SHOULD GET OUT OF THE COMMITTEE TODAY. IS LIKELY TO TAKE AMENDMENTS IN THE NEX COMMITTEE. BUT ALSO. A SPEAKING ABOUT THE. THE FISCAL FACILITY IS UNLIMITED BUT THE THIS PROGRAM WILL EXPAND THE NUMBER OF ELIGIBLE CHILDREN TO BE ENROLLED BY CHOICE NOT BY REQUIREMENTS. SO IF THE FACILITY HAS THE SPACE FOR MORE BECAUSE REMEMBER THE RATIOS CHANGE AND THE GUIDELINES CHANGED THEN THEY'RE ABLE TO DO MORE AND THAT IS NOT AN OPTION THAT IS ON THE TABLE RIGHT NOW. OKAY THANK YOU. DO WE HAVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SENATOR WOULD YOU LIKE TO COOK I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. WE HAVE A MOTION BY ASSEMBLYWOMAN DAVIES AND THE SECOND BY FROM WORK. THE QUESTION IS DO YOU PASS TO THE ASSEMBLY EDUCATION COMMITTEE CALDERON HI CALDERON AYE DAVIES DAVIES I ARAMBULA ARAMBULA HI BRIAN. BRIAN I CHOI CHOI AYE STONE. STONE I FILIPPIDIS LITTLE BIT ABOUT I LORD LORD I. EIGHT TWO ZERO THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU SENATOR. OKAY SENATOR WELL ARE YOU READY TO PRESENT ON SB FIVE FOUR SIX. WHENEVER YOU'RE READY SIR. THANK YOU CHAIR MEMBERS BEFORE YOU AS SB FIVE FORTY SIX WHICH EXTENDS THE AYE FOSTER PILOT PROGRAM IS PART OF THE PUC'S BROADER LIFELINE PROGRAM THIS BILL WILL ENSURE THAT CRUCIAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES ARE CONTINUALLY OFFERED TO FOSTER YOUTH L. A. COUNTY HAS A LARGE POPULATION OF FOSTER YOUTH AND ONE OUT OF EVERY THREE FOSTER YOUTH- RESIDE IN THE TWENTY FIRST SENATE-DISTRICT AND I'M WELL AWARE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT THEY FACE. IF YOU LOOK AT THE DATA ON FOSTER YOUTH IT'S QUITE HEARTBREAKING- THEIR GRADUATION RATE FROM HIGH SCHOOL IS HALF OF THE NORMAL RATE ONLY 4% GRADUATE FROM COLLEGE AND THOUGH THEY DON'T HAVE HARD FIGURES THE DEPARTMENT CORRECTIONS BELIEVES THAT MAYBE AS HIGH AS 20% OF THE PRISON POPULATION ARE FORMER. FOSTER YOUTH. SO THANKFULLY THE DATA SHOWS THAT THE RESOURCES OF HAVING A PHONE MAKES A DIFFERENCE IN THESE USE LIFE BE ABLE TO REACH OUT TO THE MENTORS TO THEIR FAMILY HEALTH SERVICES EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE SEEN THIS LAST YEAR AND IT COULD BE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN EARLIER AND SUCCESS. NOW OBVIOUSLY HAVING A PHONE CREATE STABILITY IN THEIR LIFE WHICH IS MUCH NEEDED. SO WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY I GUESS OVER THE PHONE IS CERITA OF THE AYE FOSTER PROGRAMS. THANK YOU SENATOR OPERATOR CAN YOU PLEASE OPEN THE LINE FOR THREE TO FIVE SIX. THREE O'CLOCK DEADLINE IT OPEN. GOOD AFTERNOON AND THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE AYE FOSTERS AND OUR PARTNER SUPPORT FOR SB FIVE FORTY SIX MY NAME IS RITA **** I AM THE CEO AND CO FOUNDER OF AYE FOSTER AND A FORMER BOSS TO USE I FOSTER THE NATIONAL NONPROFIT PROVIDING OVER A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE MILLION IN RESOURCES TO ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE THOUSAND COST USED ANNUALLY ACROSS ALL FIFTY STATES. AS SENATOR WHAT MENTIONED ACCESS TO RELIABLE COMMUNICATIONS IS A TRUE LIFELINE FOR OUR USE. IN JUST A YEAR AND A HALF THE AYE FOSTER PHONES FOR COST YOU THE LIFELINE PILOT HAS PROVIDED COMMUNICATIONS FOR THIRTEEN THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND FORTY TWO CALIFORNIA COST TO USE. MEETING THE NEEDS OF 84% OF PILOT ELIGIBLE USED. AS WELL AS CONNECTING NEARLY TWO THOUSAND FIVE TO USE IN CALIFORNIA WHO ARE NOT ELIGIBLE- WITH FUNDING FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES AND PHILANTHROPY. PILOT PARTICIPANTS HAVE BEEN USING THEIR PHONES FOR COMMUNICATIONS WITH FRIENDS FAMILY AND THEIR SUPPORT NETWORKS FOR SCHOOLWORK EMPLOYMENT AND TELEHEALTH. 101% OF PARTICIPANTS SURVEYED AND THEIR FOSTER YOUTH SERVING AGENCIES BELIEVE THIS PROGRAM SHOULD BE CONTINUED AND SHOULD BE NATIONWIDE. WHICH IS WHY WE NEED YOUR SUPPORT FOR SB FIVE FORTY SIX. WELL THE CPUC DOES HAVE PURVIEW OVER THE PILOT THESE VIEWS ARE WARDS OF THE STATE AND IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO ENSURE THAT THEIR TELECOMMUNICATIONS OF RIGHTS AS COULD APPLIED IN THE CALIFORNIA FOSTER CARE BILL OF RIGHTS ARE REALIZED. THIS PROGRAM IS THE ONLY PROGRAM THAT THE BILL'S THEIR RIGHTS INCLUSIVELY AND EQUITABLY. YOUR SUPPORT IS REQUIRED TO ENSURE THIS PROGRAM CONTINUES WITH NO SERVICE GAPS WELL WE ARE SPOILED WITH COMMISSIONER SHOULD ALMOST PROPOSED DECISION ON JUNE EIGHTH TWENTY TWENTY ONE. WE DO NOT YET HAVE A DEFINITIVE DECISION NOT COATED BY PLANS FOR HOW THIS PILOT WILL BECOME. A PERMANENT THE LIFELINE PROGRAM. THIS DECISION TO MAKE OUR PROGRAM PERMANENT IS NOT WITHOUT LOGISTICAL HURDLES INCLUDING REQUIRING THE SWAP OUT OF EVERY SINGLE. PHONE PRIOR TO THE END OF THIS YEAR. TIME IS RUNNING AND WE CANNOT AFFORD DELAYS ON JANUARY FIRST FIFTEEN THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED ELEVEN FOSTER USE PHONES WILL CEASE TO FUNCTION. WELL ALL THE PARTIES ARE WORKING ON DRAFTING PLANS AND BUDGETS A DECISION IS NOT YET EXPECTED UNTIL JULY FIFTEENTH. WHEN THE COMMISSION IS SCHEDULED TO VOTE LEAVING ONLY FIVE AND A HALF MONTHS TO ENSURE THAT FOSTER USED TO NOT LOSE TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES. ANY DELAYS IN BOTH OF FURTHER HEARINGS COULD JEOPARDIZE THIS TIME FRAME. FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF FOSTER CARE COMMUNITY AND AS EVIDENCED BY THE RECENT CQC EVALUATION OF THE PROGRAM THE I TALKED TO POUNDS TO POCKET PILOT HAS BEEN A SUCCESS WITH FIFTEEN THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED ELEVEN CALIFORNIA. BOB DO YOU RECEIVING CRITICAL COMMUNICATIONS THAT THEY NEED BUT THERE IS A RISK THAT ARE CALIFORNIA PASSED YOU'D LOSE ALL OF THEIR COMMUNICATION GAINES. LOSING SERVICE CAN HAVE DIRE CONSEQUENCES. AS ONE NEW PARTICIPANT SHARED I MIGHT HAVE COMMITTED SUICIDE IF I WASN'T ABLE TO REACH OUT TO MY SUPPORT SYSTEM GOODBYE I FOSTER FROM. FOR THIS REASON I FOSTER AND OUR PARTNER ORGANIZATIONS SUPPORT SB FIVE FORTY SIX AND RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU MISS **** DO WE HAVE ANY.

ONE OF THE THINGS THAT CONCERNS ME WITH THIS AND MANY OTHER BILLS THAT WE HEAR BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE HELD ON HIS. FIRST DAY. IS ARBITRARY LINE THAT TO BE ELIGIBLE AS A FORMER FOSTER YOUTH BETWEEN TWENTY ONE TO TWENTY SIX YOU HAD TO HAVE BEEN IN FOSTER CARE AFTER AGE THIRTEEN THE AVERAGE AGE OF FOSTER. YOUTH IN CALIFORNIA THEY KNOW HALF THE AVERAGE TIME YOU'RE IN FOSTER CARE IS TWO AND A HALF YEARS. THE AVERAGE YOUTH THERE FOR THE AVERAGE TIME WHEN QUALIFY FOR THIS. AND OBVIOUSLY THIS KIND OF A LINE IS A COST SAVING MECHANISM BUT IN A- YEAR LIKE THIS I DON'T KNOW THAT WE HAVE TO DRAW THIS KIND OF A LINE- WE HAVE. TWO HUNDRED SIXTY BILLION DOLLARS COMING OUT OF THE STATE BUDGET AND- BIFURCATING WHICH FOSTER YOUTH ARE DESERVING. OF BEING OUT OF FOR THIS PROGRAM WHICH FORMER FOSTER YOUTH OR NOT.

THAT IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE BUT CALIFORNIA IN THE US IN GENERAL HAVE STILL HAVE HIGH RATES OF MATERNAL MORTALITY AND INFANT MORTALITY HIGHEST AMONG BLACK WOMEN. THEN OUR NATIVE INDIGENOUS WOMEN IN LATINO WOMEN AND THAT'S OUTRAGEOUS THIS BILLS ADDRESSED TO ADDRESS THAT AND I'LL LEAVE IT ALONE IT I'LL- TAKE YOUR VOTE YOUR MOTION. AS A GOOD SIGN AND I WILL ASK MY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT TO SPEAK IT IS DR SEAH MALALA WHO IS THE A PEDIATRICIAN WITH SF DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. AND CHANTE DAVIS BULGE WHO IS A JEWELER AND THE PRESIDENT OF THE SEAT AND- PRESIDENT OF THE BLACK WELLNESS AND PROSPERITY CENTER. THANK YOU SENATOR OPERATOR CAN YOU PLEASE OPEN THE LINE FOR THE WITNESSES WITH DOCTOR AS THE MLS SPEAKING FIRST. DR ALLOWED LINE IS OPEN. HI CAN YOU HEAR ME. YES. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY I'M DR SAM ALLOWANCE I'M A BLACK PEDIATRICIAN MOTHER AND I'M TESTIFYING ON BEHALF OF THE CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO WHO'S IN STRONG SUPPORTER OF SB SIXTY FIVE- I WANT TO BRIEFLY SHARE A STORY OF A PATIENT OF MINE ARE WE CAN COLLECTIVELY. KEVIN HE WAS VERY EXCITED TO BECOME A MOTHER SHE STARTED SCHEDULING APPOINTMENTS WITH ME THE ATTRITION WHEN SHE WAS BARELY FIVE MONTHS PREGNANT BEFORE THE BABY WAS EVEN OUT BECAUSE SHE JUST REALLY WANTED TO MAKE SURE SHE WAS DOING EVERYTHING RIGHT FOR THIS BABY AND I THOUGHT EARLY VISITS AND LEARNED THAT SHE WAS WORRIED ABOUT PAYING HER RENT AND HER BOSS HAD BEEN CUTTING HER HOURS EVER SINCE YOU FOUND OUT SHE WAS PREGNANT AND HER- B. WROTE A NOTE LIMITING HOW MUCH TECHNIQUE OF MISSED AT WORK. BUT BY THE TIME HE WAS SIX MONTHS PREGNANT HE HAD MOVED OUT OF HER APARTMENT BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T WANT IT IS AN ADDICTION ON HER RECORD AND SHE WAS COUCH SURFING AND SO NOT SURPRISINGLY SHE HAD HER BABY TWO ONE HALF MONTHS EARLY AND HER BABY. WAS FIRST FOR HIM SO LITTLE. IT'LL FOR. MONTH OF HIS LIFE. AND STORY UNFORTUNATELY IS NOT UNUSUAL ESPECIALLY FOR BLACK MOTHERS. CALIFORNIA CAN ONLY PROSPER WHEN ALL OF OUR CHILDREN HAVE A FAIR CHANCE TO BE BORN HEALTHY. AND REACH THEIR FULL POTENTIAL. IN CALIFORNIA TODAY HOWEVER TOO MANY PREGNANT PEOPLE. ARE SHUT OUT OF THE RESOURCES AND OPPORTUNITIES THAT THEY NEED TO HAVE A HEALTHY PREGNANCY AND BIRTH. RESOURCES LIKE HOUSING. RESPECTFUL HEALTHCARE. NURSING FOOD GOOD JOBS AND LIVABLE WAGES. WHICH WE KNOW ARE ESSENTIAL- THE CONSEQUENCES OF NOT HAVING ACCESS TO THESE RESOURCES ARE DEVASTATING FOR ALL OF US. TODAY IN CALIFORNIA. ONE IN EIGHT BLACK BABIES IS BORN PREMATURE. A RATED PRE MATURITY THAT'S WORSE THAN MANY DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. AND IT'S CALIFORNIA. NATIVE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE THE SECOND HIGHEST RATE OF PRETERM BIRTH. AND UNFORTUNATELY THE GROUPS ARE ALSO FACED WITH THE BURDEN OF HIGHER RATES OF MATERNAL MORTALITY AND INFANT MORTALITY. SO IT'S PREMATURE WHEN THEY'RE BORN IN JUST A FEW WEEKS PREMATURE THE IMPACT CAN LAST A LIFETIME. BABIES THAT ARE BORN PREMATURE MAY FACE RISK OF HEALTH AND COGNITIVE PROBLEMS THROUGHOUT THEIR LIFE. ALSO WHEN YOU CONSIDER THE THOUGHT. HERE IN LEON NEAL INTENSIVE UNIT. AND PARENTS LOST HOURS OF PRODUCTIVITY WHILE CARING FOR A PREEMIE AND THE TRAUMA TO THE FAMILY IT'S CLEAR HOW THESE BURDENS. ARE ARE ARE THE DISPARITIES ARE BURNING ALL OF US. THE MORE PRETERM BABIES THAT ARE BORN IN OUR STATE THE LESS HEALTHY WE ARE AT THE COMMUNITY. SB 65% OF REAL OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE A POSITIVE. CHANGE FOR CALIFORNIA PARENTS AND BABIES. THESE INITIATIVES IT CONTAINED WITHIN SB FIFTY FIVE WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE WHAT THE WAY. TO LAST DR ACCOUNTABILITY AND CASH HAVE ALL BEEN SHOWN TO MAKE BRITAIN SAFER FOR MOTHERS AND BABIES. FOR INSTANCE THEY HAVE HAD A THE INCOMES UP MANITOBA THAT'S- TO THE ONE WE PROPOSED SB SIXTY FIVE. FOR OVER TEN YEARS AND WITH THIS ONE PREGNANCY INCOME SUPPLEMENT THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO REDUCE PRETERM BIRTH RATE. BY SEVENTEEN POINT 5% AND FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE NOT. IN THE ROOM IF THE MEDICATION CAN IMPROVE A DISEASE RIGHT BY EVEN SEVENTEEN POINT 5% REDUCTION IS A REALLY BIG DEAL. REDUCING THE STRESS ASSOCIATED WITH MAKING RENTER FEEL LIKE FILLING THE FRIDGE. AND ALSO ADDRESS THE UNDERLYING STRESS THAT THE FACTORS IN PRETERM BIRTH AND OTHER ADVERSE HEALTH OUTCOMES SO THIS APPROACH CAN BEGIN TO ADDRESS OUR STATE'S RACIST PAST. LIKE OUR HISTORY OF REDLINING AND URBAN RENEWAL THAT HAS LEFT BLACK AND INDIGENOUS RESIDENTS. PARTICULARLY UNDER RESOURCE IN THE MIDST OF OUR STRONG ECONOMY. THIS PROGRAM BUILDS ON THE GROWING MOMENTUM TO PROVIDE. INCOME AS A SOLUTION TO POVERTY AND THE POLICY TOWARD HAS GAINED EVEN MORE TRACTION IN THE PAST YEAR DUE TO THE COBIT NINETEEN PANDEMIC. HERE IN SAN FRANCISCO WE BELIEVE IN THE SOLUTION SO STRONGLY THAT WE RECENT RECENTLY LAUNCHED OUR OWN PREGNANCY INCOME PILOT. IT'S CALLED THE ABANDONED BIRTH PROJECT AND THE COMMUNITY HAS BEEN NOTHING SHORT OF OVERWHELMING IN. TERMS OF THE NUMBER OF APPLICATIONS WE'VE GOTTEN. A PREGNANCY INCOMES. WILL MAKE COURT INVOLVING DURING A- STAGE OF LIFE. AND THE PAYOFF WILL BE FELT BEYOND. FAMILIES HAVE OPTED TO LIQUIDITY ESPECIALLY AS WE EMERGE FROM THAT CAN. HOW WILL OUR SCHOOLS PRIVATE MORE PARENTS ARE NO LONGER LIVING HAND TO MOUTH. YOU CAN SPEND QUALITY TIME WITH THEIR CHILDREN AND VOLUNTEER AT THEIR SCHOOLS. WHAT WHAT ARE STATE LOOK LIKE IN THE FUTURE ONE MORE FAMILIES ARE STABLY HOUSED AND FED. AND THEIR CHILDREN ACTUALLY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO REACH THEIR FULLEST POTENTIAL. WHEN WE WORK TOGETHER TO ENSURE THAT OUR CHILDREN. MOTHERS AND FAMILIES CAN PLOW WE CREATE A BETTER FUTURE FOR ALL OF US. AND SO I URGE YOU TO SUPPORT SB SIXTY FIVE. I THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU DR MILA- OPERATOR CAN YOU OPEN THE LINE FIRST- THE NEXT WITNESS CHANTE DIE DAVIES FONG. OKAY DAVID BOX LINE IS OPEN THANK YOU.

AND EXPERIENCE TO PRETERM BIRTH MYSELF BUT BEFORE THAT I WAS THE DAUGHTER OF AN AMAZING WOMAN WHO DESPITE HER BEST EFFORTS BUT NEVER ABLE TO GET A HAT WE WERE OFTEN ON HOW INDEPENDENT ON CASH.

THAT UNDER THE IMPORTANCE OF SUPPORTING SB SIXTY FIVE AND IT ABILITY TO STABILIZE OUR MOST VULNERABLE. BLACK WOMEN AND BABIES. WE KNOW THAT BLACK WOMEN AND BABIES EXPERIENCE THE HIGHEST BURDEN OF PRETERM BIRTH INFANT MORTALITY AND LOW BIRTH RATE. DR MALUS SHARED SOME DATA BUT I ALSO WANT TO SHARE THAT INSPIRED YOU KNOW FOR EXAMPLE BLACK BABIES ARE MORE THAN THREE TIMES MORE LIKELY TO DIE BEFORE THEIR FIRST BIRTHDAY THAT MIGHT BE. AND IT'S NOT CHEN ALL WE KNOW WHAT THE STOMACH. DATA ON THE EXPERIENCES OF BLACK WOMEN POINT TWO STARKLY UNEQUAL TREATMENT. LEADING TO SEVERE GAPS AND HEALTH AND ECONOMIC OUTCOMES AND OPPORTUNITIES. BLACK WOMEN ARE MORE LIKELY TO. HOUSING INSTABILITY AND LESS LIKELY TO HAVE THE SOCIAL FINANCIAL AND EMOTIONAL SUPPORT THEY NEED DURING PREGNANCY AND BIRTH. SB SIXTY FIVE LAYS THE GROUNDWORK FOR A CULTURALLY CONCORD APPROACH LEVERAGING THE POWER ABSTRACT AND SHARED EXPERIENCES TO PROVIDE MUCH NEEDED SOCIAL SUPPORT THREE DO LET. US ARE IN CENTRAL POINT AND I DRAFTING THE SCRAP LOAD THAT DRIVE BURKE DISPARITIES.

IN OUR COMMUNITY STANDING UP FOR WHAT'S OCCURRING TO MANY BLACK WOMEN. NOT ONLY IN MY COMMUNITY BUT THROUGHOUT THE STATE I THINK THE MEASURE THAT'S BEFORE US WILL GO A LONG WAY TOWARDS ADDRESSING MANY OF THE SYSTEMIC ISSUES THAT I'VE FACED ARE COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND REALLY APPRECIATIVE OF THIS BILL. I WOULD JUST REMIND THIS COMMITTEE OF FOR DISCUSSING RULES THAT WE HAVE BOTH A MOTION AND A SECOND ON THIS BILL I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO AN OPPORTUNITY. TO BE ABLE TO VOTE FOR IT LATER TODAY. THANK YOU SEVEN MEMBERS. ANYBODY ELSE HAVE A COMMENT ASSEMBLY MEMBER I AM. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU SENATE'S GONNA FOR BRINGING THIS BILL. NONPROFIT OF THE YEAR AND FIFTY WITH A SIMPLE DISH WAS BLACK WOMEN FOR WELLNESS FOR REASON. THIS KIND OF WORK IS IMPORTANT IT'S LONG OVERDUE- NOW IS THE RIGHT MOMENT IT'S BEEN THE RIGHT MOMENT FOR A LONG TIME I'M GLAD IT BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE. I LOOK FOR THE VOTING ON IT AS WELL- THE DIFFERENCE OF OPINION FROM RULES AS YOU'D MENTIONED THAT'S BEEN SETTLED THEY'VE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO THINK ABOUT THIS AND RECALL IF THEY WANTED. IT HASN'T IT'S MADE IT THIS FAR NEEDS TO CONTINUE MOVING ALONG. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. I WOULD AT ANY OTHER MEMBERS HAVE ANY COMMENTS. OKAY- ASSEMBLY MENTOR CHOI- I WOULD LIKE TO PUT THE SENATOR CLOSE ON HER BILL RIGHT NOW IF YOU. I DON'T HAVE ANY OTHER COMMENTS THERE ARE. TENSAI HERE TO DIFFERENT VERSIONS I THINK I HAVE TO FOLLOW UP WITH YOU CONSISTENT COUPLE GAVE ME THIS UP- I'M PROCEDURAL PROBLEM ON. THE ISSUES SO HE HE HAS RACED. OKAY GO AHEAD ALL I CAN AFFORD AND IS THANK YOU SENATOR PER YOUR PATIENTS GO HEAD AND- PLEASE WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE ON YOUR BILL CERTAINLY THANK YOU VERY MUCH- WE- MOST. NOT EVERYTHING IN THE BILL BENEFITS THE LOWEST INCOME A PREGNANT PEOPLE AND- INFERENCE- THERE ARE PARTS OF IT THAT BENEFIT MORE BUT WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT IN TERMS OF BLACK. MORTALITY IN AB MATERNAL MORTALITY AND INFANT MORTALITY IT IS CROSS ALL INCOME LEVELS AND EDUCATION LEVELS. ONE ONLY HAS TO US READ THE REPORTS OF SERENA WILLIAMS BIRTH FOR EXAMPLE BEYOND STAYS MANY MORE- SO WHILE THIS BILL WILL NOT ADDRESS. OR FIX ALL OF THOSE DISPARITIES THE DATA COMPONENTS ARE VERY IMPORTANT FOR US TO UNDERSTAND THEM AND THEN FINALLY I WOULD SAY THAT- THERE MUCH OF THE TALK HAS BEEN SO FAR ABOUT THE SUPPORT- DURING PREGNANCY. HOWEVER WE ALSO KNOW THAT THOSE FIRST WEEKS AND MONTHS AFTER BIRTH ARE ALSO VERY VERY IMPORTANT AND- MANY MANY MOTHERS WHO EITHER. ARE YOU KNOW WERE INJURED DURING THE DELIVERY OR WHOSE BABIES HAVE ISSUES HAVE NO SUPPORT. AND I YOU KNOW I CAN UNDERSTAND THIS INTELLECTUALLY AND WHEN I CARRIED WHEN I INTRODUCED THIS BILL I APPRECIATED IT ALL INTELLECTUALLY HOWEVER I'VE JUST EXPERIENCED MY FIRST GRAND BABY WAS BORN JUST ON JUNE NINTH. MY DAUGHTER HAD A VERY DIFFICULT TO LIVE RE WHICH HAS RESULTED IN SOME INJURY THAT SHE NOW HAS TO HEAL FROM. AND HER BABY HAD SOME ISSUES. SHE WAS IN A SITUATION BECAUSE OF HER SUPPORT SYSTEM TO BE ABLE SHE HAS TO LOOK HERE. AND WHAT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF SHE DID NOT HAVE THAT TO LOOK HERE I CAN'T SAY. AND SO THAT THE BILL ALSO WHICH WAS NOT MENTIONED PROVIDES DULY KERR- IN OUR MEDIC HEALTH PROGRAM AND- THAT'S I THINK SO IMPORTANT SO WITH THAT I ASK FOR YOUR VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR AND WE HAVE A MOTION FROM A SOMEONE ARAMBULA AND SECOND FROM ASSEMBLY MEMBRANE. THE MOTION IS DEEP PASSED TO THE ASSEMBLY APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE CALDERON AYE CALDERON AYE DAVIES DAVIES NO ARAMBULA ARAMBULA ALRIGHT BRIAN. BRIAN HI CHOI. CHOI NOT VOTING STONE STONE I WILL PUT IT ON FILIPPIDIS I WARD. OKAY THE VOTE FIVE TO ONE OF THE LEGAL CALL THANK YOU YOU'RE WELCOME OKAY WOULD YOU LIKE TO RESIDENT ON THE FINAL BILL SB THREE FIVE FOUR THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THANK YOU COMMITTEE FOR YOUR PATIENCE I KNOW YOU'VE HAD A LONG HEARING. SB THREE FIFTY FOUR RECOGNIZES THAT CHILDREN DO BETTER WITH FAMILY CARETAKERS AND THERE ARE SOME CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE WE HAVE IN BECAUSE OF WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THE CHILDREN ARE NOT ENDANGERED THAT WE HAVE PUT UP SOME OBSTACLES AT TIMES TO. A RELATIVE OR A EXTENDED FAMILY BEING ABLE TO CARE TAKE FOR A CHILD AND WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS WE WORKED VERY CLOSELY WITH OUR WELFARE DIRECTORS TO DEVELOP SOMETHING THAT THEY WOULD HAVE CONFIDENCE IN THAT COULD HELP PRIORITIZE. RELATIVES AND EXTENDED FAMILY CARETAKERS WERE EVER THAT WAS POSSIBLE AND SO WITH THAT I'D LIKE MY WITNESSES BONIOR QUARRELS FROM STARTING OVER INCORPORATED TO SPEAK AND KATHY SANDERLING FROM THE COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION. THANK YOU SENATOR I EACH WITNESS WILL HAVE TWO MINUTES TO THAT TESTIFYING SUPPORT OPERATOR COULD YOU PLEASE OPEN THE LINE- OPENING UP THE LINES ONE MOMENT PLEASE. AND BOTH LINES ARE OPEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS TANYA QUARRELS AND I'D LIKE TO THINK THAT SHARING COMMITTEE. FOR HEARING THIS BILL AND ALSO THANK YOU TO SENATOR SKINNER OFFERING THIS BILL. I'M A PRACTICING ATTORNEY AND A CO FOUNDER AND DIRECTOR OF STARTING OVER. JOINING OVER WAS THE NONPROFIT OF THE YEAR TWICE IN THE YEAR TWENTY TWENTY. I'M ALSO A THIRD GENERATION CONVICTED FELON. I AM THE DAUGHTER THAT SPENT FIVE YEARS IN THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM. I'M THE MOTHER OF SIX THEY HAD THREE OF MY SIX CHILDREN ADOPTED OUT TO STRANGERS. I AM A GRANDMOTHER THAT NEEDED TO STEP UP FOR TWO OF MY THIRTEEN GRANDCHILDREN TO GET THEM OUT OF THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM. IT TOOK ME OVER TWO HUNDRED DAYS TO CLEAR THE RFA PROCESS. IN SPITE OF MY DEMONSTRATED REHABILITATION. AND THE PRIVILEGES THAT COME WITH BEING ATTORNEY. AND MY DEMONSTRATED ABILITY TO CARE FOR AND LOVE MY GRANDCHILDREN IT TOOK ME OVER TWO HUNDRED DAYS. I WAS FORTUNATE BECAUSE I ENDED UP BRINGING MY GRANDCHILDREN HOME. I HAD A RELATIONSHIP WITH MY GRANDCHILDREN BEFORE CPS STEPPED IN AND TOOK THEM FROM THEIR MOTHER- THE PATERNAL GRANDMOTHER. AND I HAD ESTABLISHED A RELATIONSHIP BUT BECAUSE OF MY THIRTY PLUS YEAR OLD CRIMINAL CONVICTION HISTORY IT BECAME A HUGE BARRIER TO ME BRINGING THEM HOME AND THEY ACTUALLY HAD TO BE PLACED WITH NON RELATIVES FOR ABOUT SEVEN MONTHS DURING THE PROCESS. MY GRANDSON WAS FOUR MONTHS OLD WHEN THIS STARTED AND I WAS I LATER RECEIVED UNLIKE OTHER GRANDDAUGHTER WHO WAS TWO MONTHS OLD AND SHE'S BEEN WITH US FOR ABOUT TWO YEARS NOW. THE PART THAT BECAME THE BIGGEST BARRIER WASN'T HOW I'M LIVING TODAY. BUT DRUG CONVICTIONS FROM THIRTY YEARS AGO BUT I CANNOT AND DO. AND THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT'S SPECIFIC TO ME. THURMOND STARTING OVER I WORK WITH AND INTERACT WITH MOTHERS EVERY DAY WHO FACE THESE BARRIERS MANY OF HOME FIND THESE BARRIERS TO BE INSURMOUNTABLE. AND SO UNDERSTANDING THAT OUR FIRST PRIORITY IS THE CHILDREN I BELIEVE THAT THESE ARE CHILDREN THE CHILDREN WHO ARE GOING INTO THE HILD WELFARE SYSTEM DESERVE THE BENEFITS OF AN INDIVIDUALIZED ASSESSMENT. AND IT COMES TO RELATIVES OR NON RELATIVES IN THE FAMILY MEMBERS THAT HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH THE CHILD AND SO IN A BROAD BLANKET. YOU'RE LIKE YOU KNOW YOU HAVE CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS THAT RESTRICT YOU FROM EVER. BRINGING CHILDREN OUT OF THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM. ISN'T THAT A GOOD OUTCOME THAT WE WANT AND I BELIEVE THAT WE ALL WANT WHAT'S BEST FOR THE CHILDREN BUT I BELIEVE THAT THIS PARTICULAR BARRIER IS CREATING MORE HARM BECAUSE WE'RE BASING THE OUTCOME OF CHILD PLACEMENT. ON THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. THAT THE DATA SHOWN HAVE THAT THIS DISPARITY IMPACT UPON BLACK AND BROWN PEOPLE IN OUR COMMUNITY AND THEREFORE BELCHING BLACK AND BROWN CHILDREN ARE AT A DISADVANTAGE WHEN IT COMES TO BEING PLACED WITH FAMILY MEMBERS BECAUSE WE'RE RELYING. ON CRIMINAL BACKGROUNDS TO THE POINT THAT WE FOREGO EVERYTHING ELSE. SO NOW I'M ABLE TO READ TO MY GRANDCHILDREN LOVE MY GRANDCHILDREN AND BE IN THEIR LIFE. AND I BELIEVE THIS IS- GOOD FOR OUR FAMILY IT'S GOOD FOR CALIFORNIA AND MORE AND MORE PEOPLE SHOULD BE AFFORDED THEBENEFITS OF AN INDIVIDUALIZED ASSESSMENT I ASK AND URGE YOU TO VOTE YES ON SB. SIXTY FOUR- SO THAT MORE OF US WOULD HAVE THIS OPPORTUNITY AND I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND FOR LISTENING AGAIN MY NAME IS TANYA QUARRELS I'M A NATIVE OF CALIFORNIA AND I LIVE IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY. AND I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME AND CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU MS CORALS OPERATOR CAN YOU PLEASE OPEN THE LINE FOR NEXT WITNESS- CATHERINE SANDERLING A DONALD AND YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES. THANK YOU. GREAT THANK YOU MADAM% CHAIR AND MEMBERS HAPPY THUNDERWING MAKE ALL BUT THE QUOTE THAT COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION. DWTS REALLY PLEASED TO BE ABLE TO CO SPONSOR SB THREE FIFTY FOUR WITH A HOST OF OTHER AMAZING ORGANIZATIONS IN HONOR TO TESTIFY WITH YOU TODAY. FIRST I THINK THE COURT AND LIFT UP THE COMMENT BY SENATOR SKINNER AND MISS QUARRELS REGARDING DISPROPORTIONATELY THAT EXIST IN OUR CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM AS ONE OF THE INEQUITIES IN OUR UNDERLYING CRIMINALS THAT THAT THAT THAT. THAT NEGATIVELY AFFECT RELATIVE SPEAKING TO CARE FOR CHILDREN ARE BROUGHT INTO FOSTER CARE STEMMING COUNTY CHILD WELFARE AGENCY PERSPECTIVE THIS BILL IS IMPORTANT. BECAUSE IT WILL HELP CHINESE PLACE MORE CHILDREN WITH RELATIVE CAREGIVERS WHEN THEY COME INTO CARE RESEARCH SHOWS THAT CHILDREN IN FOSTER CARE ARE MUCH BETTER WITH RELATIVES IN GENERAL AND RELATIVE TO THE FIRST PLACE COUNTY TURNED OUT BY LAW AND BEST PRACTICE. AS PART OF THE RESEARCH FAMILY APPROVAL PROCESS WHICH APPLIES TO ALL POTENTIAL CARE GIVERS ANY PERSON LIVING IN A REGULARLY PRESENT IN THE HOME NOT BE BACKGROUND CHECKED. ANYONE WITH MORE THAN A MINOR TRAFFIC OR MARIJUANA INTERACTION BUT THE CAN EXEMPTION OR THE HOME CANNOT BE APPROVED. EXEMPTIONS ARE DONE ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS GRANTED AFTER NEXT CENTER REVIEW OF THE CRIME AS WELL AS THE PERSON IS TAKEN STEPS THAT TIME TO SHOW THEY HAVE CHANGED AND ARE ABLE TO PROVIDE A SAFE AND LOVING ENVIRONMENT. NOT EVERY EXEMPTION OR CLUSTERS GRANTED AN APPROVAL OF THE EXEMPTION AND SUBSEQUENT APPROVAL AT THE RESORT FAMILY DOES NOT GUARANTEE THAT A. PARTICULAR CHILD WILL BE PLACED IN THAT HOUSE. IN RECENT YEARS HE- HAS SUPPORT INCOME. EFFORTS TO THE- AND EXPAND. THE AVAILABILITY OF EXEMPTS FOR MINOR CRIMES. AND CRIMES THAT OCCURRED THE PAST. HOW MANY CRIMES REMAIN ON. THIS BILL TAKES IT APART NEXT STEP GUIDED BY A RECENT HARDCORE DECISION STICK IT WHERE THE CURRENT CROP OF UNCONSTITUTIONAL. WHEN IT COMES TO RELATIVES AND NON RELATED EXTENDED FAMILY MEMBERS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED A POTENTIAL CARE GIVERS FOR SPECIFIC RELATED CHILD. IN THE DECISION TELL THEM THEIR KNOWLEDGE THAT THE COURT WILL THAT SOMEONE CONVICTED OF A CRIME. THAT OTHERWISE CONSIDER NOT UNCOMFORTABLE UNDER LAW. MUST BE GIVEN A CASE BY CASE CHANCE TO REQUEST THEM ATTACHED WOULD RECEIVE AN EXAM CENTER. IF THE RELATIONSHIP OF THE CHILD THAT THEY CAN'T GET OUT OF A PARENT. SCALIA'S CONSIDERING AN EXEMPTION UNDER THIS NEW PROVISION WOULD ESTABLISH THAT SUCH A RELATIONSHIP THE BEST. INTEREST OF THE CHILD THE RELATIVES AND OTHERS WITH KNOWLEDGE OF THE RELATIONSHIP. THIS WILL BE HELD BY THE TYLER FAMILY TEAMING PROPER CREDIT CARD WITH A CHILD IS BROUGHT INTO CARE. WHICH INCLUDES OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS AS WELL AS OTHER SUPPORT AND THE CHILD'S LIFE. IMPORTANTLY THE EXEMPTION PROCESS ITSELF REMAIN AN EXPENSIVE CASE BY CASE. PROCESS AND IT WOULD NOT BE AUTOMATIC. RIGHT COUNTY SANTA. WHEN IT EVEN. PEARL OF CARE FOR PER. CHILD'S EVEN IF THEIR CRIME OCCUR LAW AGO AND CLEARLY CHANGED I NEVER NOTHING EXISTING RELATIONS. WITH ITS- THE CARD IS A MADE CLEAR THAT NEED TO CHECK OUR LIVES ALLOW FOR THAT CASE CASE EXEMPTION THE CONFEDERATE. WHEN HE PARLAYED HAVE ALREADY EXIST BETWEEN THE CHILD.
