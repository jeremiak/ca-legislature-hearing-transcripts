00:54:18.321 --> 00:54:20.190
THEIR FAMILIES.

00:54:20.256 --> 00:54:21.057
AS A MEANS OF CONTROL AND

00:54:21.124 --> 00:54:22.993
DISCRIMINATION.

WE KNOW. THAT THE CHAINS OF

00:54:39.376 --> 00:54:41.611
OPPRESSION AND MARGINALIZATION

WERE LITERAL SHACKLES THAT BOUND

00:54:43.713 --> 00:54:45.215
TO PEOPLE INTO CENTURIES.

00:54:45.281 --> 00:54:47.684

MISTER HOLDEN FROM PASADENA IN

00:56:08.998 --> 00:56:11.267
BRINGING THIS RESOLUTION FOR.

00:56:11.334 --> 00:56:12.635
YOU A JUNETEENTH IS AN EXTREMELY

00:56:12.702 --> 00:56:14.838
IMPORTANT DAY WAS HISTORICALLY

00:56:14.904 --> 00:56:16.840
IN THE LIFE OF AFRICAN AMERICANS.

00:56:16.906 --> 00:56:17.907
BECAUSE IT ENDED FOR AT LEAST

00:56:17.974 --> 00:56:19.375
LEGALLY.

00:56:19.442 --> 00:56:21.945
SLAVERY IN THIS COUNTRY.

00:56:22.011 --> 00:56:22.779
BUT AS POINTED OUT IT ISSUED IN

00:56:22.846 --> 00:56:24.447
A NEW ERA.

00:56:24.514 --> 00:56:25.949
IN THAT ERA CONTINUES TO THIS

00:56:26.015 --> 00:56:28.651
DAY IN DIFFERENT FORMS.

00:56:28.718 --> 00:56:29.486
AND DIFFERENT METHODS AND

00:56:29.552 --> 00:56:30.754
DIFFERENT OPPORTUNITY ACT OF

00:56:30.820 --> 00:56:32.789
OPPORTUNITY FOR SO MANY.

00:56:32.856 --> 00:56:33.790
BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT ALSO

00:56:33.857 --> 00:56:36.926
TO RECOGNIZE THAT EVEN THOUGH.

00:56:36.993 --> 00:56:38.428
IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY FIVE WHEN

00:56:38.495 --> 00:56:40.363
EMANCIPATION CAME AND WAS TOLD

00:56:40.430 --> 00:56:41.598
TO THE LAST WEEK WITH PEOPLE AND

00:56:41.664 --> 00:56:43.133
TEXAS THAT THEY HAD BEEN FREED

00:56:43.199 --> 00:56:44.734
LEGALLY FREE.

00:56:44.801 --> 00:56:45.935
THE RESIDUAL IMPACT OF THAT IS

00:56:46.002 --> 00:56:47.904
STILL FELT.

00:56:47.971 --> 00:56:49.239
AND I THINK LAST YEAR A TALK TO

00:56:49.305 --> 00:56:51.608
YOU ABOUT A A WALLET THAT I SAW

00:56:51.674 --> 00:56:53.276
WHEN I WAS AT THE MUSEUM.

00:56:53.343 --> 00:56:54.744
AND HOW PRECIOUS FREEDOM WAS

00:56:54.811 --> 00:56:56.279
BECAUSE IT WAS SO FRAGILE TO

00:56:56.346 --> 00:56:58.581
THOSE WHO ARE WHO ARE IN SLAVE

00:56:58.648 --> 00:57:00.283
AND THOSE WHO WOULD NOT ENSLAVED.

00:57:00.350 --> 00:57:01.851
BUT IT ALSO HAS AN IMPACT ON

00:57:01.918 --> 00:57:04.053
PEOPLE'S LIVES TODAY.

00:57:04.120 --> 00:57:05.355
HOW'S THAT A BOOK CLUB YESTERDAY

00:57:05.421 --> 00:57:06.222
AND WE WERE READING A BOOK

00:57:06.289 --> 00:57:07.257
CALLED HOMECOMING BY THE AFRICAN

00:57:07.323 --> 00:57:09.159
AUTHOR.

00:57:09.225 --> 00:57:10.627
AND ONE OF THE THINGS OF THE

00:57:10.693 --> 00:57:12.095
FAME OF ONE OF THOSE BOOKS WAS

00:57:12.162 --> 00:57:13.930
THE ISSUE OF BELONGING.

00:57:13.997 --> 00:57:16.866
AND UNDERSTANDING WHO YOU ARE.

00:57:16.933 --> 00:57:18.301
AND I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUE

00:57:18.368 --> 00:57:19.435
FROM FROM THE ASSEMBLY DISTRICT

00:57:19.502 --> 00:57:20.770
ONE.

00:57:20.837 --> 00:57:22.005
AND THE MEMBERS OF HIS OF HIS

00:57:22.071 --> 00:57:23.673
STAFF.

00:57:23.740 --> 00:57:25.141
FOR HELPING US TO GET A LITTLE

00:57:25.208 --> 00:57:27.443
BIT CLOSER TO UNDERSTANDING

00:57:27.510 --> 00:57:28.945
THE IMPACT OF THAT SLAVERY HAS

00:57:29.012 --> 00:57:31.147
HAD ON OUR LIVES.

00:57:31.214 --> 00:57:32.715
YOU KNOW MOST OF YOU CAN BEGIN

00:57:32.782 --> 00:57:34.851
TO TALK ABOUT YOUR FAMILY.

00:57:34.918 --> 00:57:36.386
A YOU CAN TALK ABOUT HOW FAR YOU

00:57:36.452 --> 00:57:37.787
CAN GO BACK AND YOU CAN REMEMBER

00:57:37.854 --> 00:57:39.122
YOUR RELATIVES AND YOU HAVE

00:57:39.189 --> 00:57:40.523
PHOTOGRAPHS WE HAVE PICTURES AND

00:57:40.590 --> 00:57:41.891
YOU HAVE. ALL OF THIS STUFF THAT

00:57:41.958 --> 00:57:44.060
HELPS YOU TO DEFINE WHO YOU ARE

00:57:44.127 --> 00:57:46.062
AS A PERSON.

00:57:46.129 --> 00:57:47.931
IF YOU'RE AN AFRICAN AMERICAN.

00:57:47.997 --> 00:57:48.898
YOU'LL BE LUCKY TO KNOW YOUR

00:57:48.965 --> 00:57:51.334
GREAT GRANDFATHER.

00:57:51.401 --> 00:57:53.703
IF YOU'RE MY AGE.

00:57:53.770 --> 00:57:54.637
OTHERS MAY KNOW THEIR GREAT

00:57:54.704 --> 00:57:56.306
GREAT IF THEY'RE YOUNGER.

00:57:56.372 --> 00:57:58.575
BUT THE ABSENCE OR THE ERASING

00:57:58.641 --> 00:58:00.410
OF HISTORY AND HERITAGE.

00:58:00.476 --> 00:58:02.345
IS SO PROFOUND.

00:58:02.412 --> 00:58:03.847
THAT IT BECOMES DIFFICULT TO

00:58:03.913 --> 00:58:06.416
HAVE A SENSE OF BELONGING.

00:58:06.482 --> 00:58:08.451
A SENSE OF IDENTITY. AND KNOWING

00:58:08.518 --> 00:58:10.520
WHO YOU ARE.

00:58:10.587 --> 00:58:12.021
YOU CAN ONLY IMAGINE IT'S ALMOST

00:58:12.088 --> 00:58:13.590
AS IF YOU WERE AN ORPHAN.

00:58:13.656 --> 00:58:15.358
YOU CAN ONLY IMAGINE HOW FAR YOU

00:58:15.425 --> 00:58:17.293
CAN GO BACK AND UNDERSTANDING.

00:58:17.360 --> 00:58:18.695
BECAUSE THE SIGNIFICANCE OF

00:58:18.761 --> 00:58:20.363
AMERICAN SLAVERY WAS AN ATTEMPT

00:58:20.430 --> 00:58:21.531
TO COMPLETELY ERASE.

00:58:21.598 --> 00:58:23.266
PASSED THE

00:58:23.333 --> 00:58:25.735
THE HISTORY THE GREATNESS OF

00:58:25.802 --> 00:58:27.403
AFRICANS IN THIS COUNTRY.

00:58:27.470 --> 00:58:28.738
SO THAT THEIR FAMILIES WERE

00:58:28.805 --> 00:58:30.273
SEPARATED AND DIVIDED NEVER TO

00:58:30.340 --> 00:58:32.075
BE FOUND AGAIN.

00:58:32.141 --> 00:58:33.376
AND ONE OF THE GREATEST THINGS

00:58:33.443 --> 00:58:34.577
THAT HAPPENED AT THE END OF

00:58:34.644 --> 00:58:36.412
EMANCIPATE OF OF SLAVERY WAS A

00:58:36.479 --> 00:58:38.681
PEOPLE BEGAN TO LOOK FOR FAMILY.

00:58:38.748 --> 00:58:40.416
AND THAT NUMBER PLAYS ABOUT

00:58:40.483 --> 00:58:41.684
PEOPLE LOOKING FOR FAMILIES JOE

00:58:41.751 --> 00:58:43.386
TURNER'S COME AND GONE IS ONE OF

00:58:43.453 --> 00:58:45.355
THOSE BUT AUGUST WILSON.

00:58:45.421 --> 00:58:46.923
AND IN THAT THERE'S ALWAYS THIS

00:58:46.990 --> 00:58:49.392
SERVES TO TRY TO FIND WHO YOU'RE

00:58:49.459 --> 00:58:50.059
PEOPLE WORK.

00:58:50.126 --> 00:58:51.928
BECAUSE YOU WERE SEPARATED.

00:58:51.995 --> 00:58:53.363
YOU MIGHT KNOW BROTHER SISTER IF

00:58:53.429 --> 00:58:54.497
THEY HAPPEN TO REMAIN AT THE

00:58:54.564 --> 00:58:56.032
SAME PLANTATION.

00:58:56.099 --> 00:58:57.734
BUT THE LIKELIHOOD OF ACTUALLY

00:58:57.800 --> 00:58:58.635
TRACING YOUR FAMILY BACK

00:58:58.701 --> 00:59:00.670
IT'S DIFFICULT.

00:59:00.737 --> 00:59:02.205
AND IT'S HARD TO EXPLAIN TO

00:59:02.272 --> 00:59:03.139
THOSE WHO HAVE ALL OF THAT IN

00:59:03.206 --> 00:59:05.074
THEIR PAST.

00:59:05.141 --> 00:59:06.442
JUST HOW ABSENCE IT FEEL IN YOUR

00:59:06.509 --> 00:59:07.644
HEART

00:59:07.710 --> 00:59:10.179
BUT YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.

00:59:10.246 --> 00:59:11.681
I WAS FORTUNATE TO CHEER TO

00:59:11.748 --> 00:59:13.683
BASICALLY GET SOME OF THAT

00:59:13.750 --> 00:59:15.418
INFORMATION NOT ALL OF IT.

00:59:15.485 --> 00:59:17.253
BUT I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW IT FELT

00:59:17.320 --> 00:59:19.188
TO FOR WANT TO SEE MY GREAT

00:59:19.255 --> 00:59:21.291
GRANDFATHER SPACE.

00:59:21.357 --> 00:59:23.559
BUT I HAD NEVER SEEN BEFORE.

00:59:23.626 --> 00:59:24.961
AND TO SEE A NAME ON A SINCE HIS

00:59:25.028 --> 00:59:26.396
RECORD.

00:59:26.462 --> 00:59:28.398
OF A GREAT GRANDFATHER.

00:59:28.464 --> 00:59:30.333
AND HAVE SOME SINCE OF TRYING TO

00:59:30.400 --> 00:59:31.901
PIECE THOSE PIECES TOGETHER BUT

00:59:31.968 --> 00:59:32.802
I HAVE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO PIECE

00:59:32.869 --> 00:59:34.637
TOGETHER.

00:59:34.704 --> 00:59:36.105
I HOPE WE UNDERSTAND WHY I TALK

00:59:36.172 --> 00:59:37.807
THE WAY I TALK.

00:59:37.874 --> 00:59:40.510
WHY HAD THE PASSION THAT I HAVE

00:59:40.576 --> 00:59:41.477
I KNOW IT COMES FROM MY PARENTS

00:59:41.544 --> 00:59:42.779
BUT I ALSO WONDER DID IT COME

00:59:42.845 --> 00:59:44.280
FROM SOME OF THEM?

00:59:44.347 --> 00:59:46.015
THAT I GET SOME OF THIS PASSION

00:59:46.082 --> 00:59:47.684
AND SOME OF THIS ELOQUENCE YOU

00:59:47.750 --> 00:59:48.918
GUYS SAY I HAVE FROM SOME OF

00:59:48.985 --> 00:59:50.086
THEM.

00:59:50.153 --> 00:59:52.722
I DON'T KNOW.

00:59:52.789 --> 00:59:54.557
AND SO IT'S THE LOS PIECES THAT

00:59:54.624 --> 00:59:55.959
ARE IN OUR LIVES THAT SLAVERY

00:59:56.025 --> 00:59:57.360
HAS TAKEN AWAY.

00:59:57.427 --> 01:00:00.029
THAT WILL NEVER BE REPLACED.

01:00:00.096 --> 01:00:01.164
AND SO I JUST WANTED TO SHARE

01:00:01.230 --> 01:00:02.265
THAT WITH YOU BECAUSE WE OFTEN

01:00:02.332 --> 01:00:03.499
TALK ABOUT THE CELEBRATION AND

01:00:03.566 --> 01:00:05.134
THE ENDING OF SLAVERY AND THE

01:00:05.201 --> 01:00:06.336
MOVING FORWARD AND THE

01:00:06.402 --> 01:00:08.404
CHALLENGES OF JIM CROW.

01:00:08.471 --> 01:00:09.505
BUT THIS OTHER PIECE THAT MAKES

01:00:09.572 --> 01:00:10.340
US HUMAN.

01:00:10.406 --> 01:00:12.342
IS THERE.

01:00:12.408 --> 01:00:15.211
I CAN REMEMBER WHEN OF. ONE OF

01:00:15.278 --> 01:00:17.447
THE AUTHOR HAD WRITTEN A BOOK

01:00:17.513 --> 01:00:19.949
AND HE WENT TO THE FREEDOM OF OF

01:00:20.016 --> 01:00:21.084
EGGMAN GHANA AND HE SAT THERE

01:00:21.150 --> 01:00:22.885
AND HE WATCHED PEOPLE. WHEN GOT

01:00:22.952 --> 01:00:24.153
I GOT ITS LIBERATION IN THE

01:00:24.220 --> 01:00:26.556
NINETEEN SIXTIES.

01:00:26.622 --> 01:00:27.824
HE SAID HE'S SADDAM LEBRON

01:00:27.890 --> 01:00:28.624
BENNETT WAS THE AUTHOR HE SAW

01:00:28.691 --> 01:00:30.927
THEM CRYING FOR THEIR FREEDOM
