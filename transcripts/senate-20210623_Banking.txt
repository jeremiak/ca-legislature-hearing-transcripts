FOR TWENTY FOUR WHICH IS DEALING WITH PRIVATE STUDENT LOANS AS YOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN WORKING QUITE A BIT ON STUDENT LOANS IN GENERAL. AND FOR PRIVATE STUDENT LOANS AS OF A YEAR AGO THERE WERE SIX HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS BOEING TEN POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS IN DEBT SO THIS IS A VERY SIGNIFICANT ISSUE. AND WHAT OFTEN HAPPENS IS THESE BORROWERS WHO MAY COME INTO TROUBLE ON THEIR DEBT AT SOME POINT AS HAPPENS WHEN THEY DO WHAT THE SERVICER OF THESE LOANS WILL OFTEN DO. IS CREATE A BIT OF A HOPE OF A QUICK AND DIRTY PROCESS TO FILE SUIT AGAINST THESE BORROWERS IN COURT AND THE BORDERS IF THEY ARE NOT REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL IN 91% OF THESE BORROWERS AS THEY GO THROUGH THIS PROCESS ARE NOT REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL DON'T ALWAYS KNOW WHAT TO DO. AND THE COURTS WILL THEN ENTER A DEFAULT JUDGMENT NOW ONCE A DEFAULT JUDGMENT IS ENTERED. ANY PROBLEM OR DEFICIENCIES IN THE FILING IS REALLY OVERCOME BECAUSE THERE IS A DEFAULT JUDGMENT THAT IS ENTERED IN TWO AGAINST THE BORROWER. AND THEN THAT DEFAULT JUDGMENT BECOMES ENFORCEABLE BUT IN MANY MANY OF THESE CASES WE HAVE FOUND THAT IT'S NOT EVEN CLEAR THAT THE PARTY BRINGING THE CASE HAS THE RIGHT TO BRING THE CASE THEY HAVE INSUFFICIENT DOCUMENTATION. THEY CAN'T EVEN ANSWER THE PROOF THAT THEY ALL KNOW WELL THEY DIDN'T HAVE ANY NECESSARILY CAN'T PROVE THAT THEY SERVE IT ON THE RIGHT INDIVIDUAL AND YET DEFAULT JUDGMENTS HAVE BEEN ENTERED INTO. ALL THIS BILL DOES IS IT ESTABLISHES A MINIMUM EVIDENTIARY STANDARD. FOR A LENDER OR A NEWS SERVICE OR WHO WANTS TO FILE A SUIT AND GOING TO COURT ASKING FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT TO MEET SOME CERTAIN STANDARDS OF DOCUMENTATION DOCUMENTING THE LONE DOCUMENTING THAT THE PERSON INVOLVED IN ENSURING THAT THAT IF THEN A DEFAULT JUDGMENT IS GOING TO BE ENTERED INTO IT IS CORRECT THAT THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO DO THIS THEY OWN THE LOAN THAT THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO BE FILING SUIT SO WE'RE ASKING THAT DAY. MAINTAINS RECORDS. AND WE'RE GIVING THE BORROWERS RATES OF ENFORCEMENT OF THIS MECHANISM WHICH IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE REMEMBER MOSTLY SUCKS AT THE TIME OR NOT REPRESENT. SENATE BY COUNCIL AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE SERVICERS ARE BEING AS RESPONSIBLE AS POSSIBLE. NOW A LOT OF THE LENDERS AND WE'RE WORKING WITH THE BANKING INDUSTRY AND THE CREDIT UNION INDUSTRY WHO ARE NOT GENERALLY THE ONES WHO ARE FILING THESE SORT OF. THESE KINDS OF LAWSUITS AND IN THIS KIND OF REPETITIVE MULTIPLE LAWSUITS TO WORKING WITH THEM ON AMENDMENTS AND MADAM CHAIR I WOULD APPRECIATE THE ANALYSIS IN THE WORK THAT YOU HAVE DONE AND- YOUR STAFF IS DONE TO HELP US WITH THIS AND PROVIDE SOME GUIDANCE. TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE GOING AFTER THE CORRECT PARTIES HERE SO WE'RE WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION. AND TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN ALLOW THEM TO PURSUE THE LEGITIMATE DEBTS THAT THEY ARE OWED THAT'S THAT WE'RE NOT TRYING TO INTERFERE WITH THAT. YET BUT TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY ARE ENGAGED IN STUDENT LOAN SERVICING THAT THERE AT LEAST SOME MINIMUM STANDARDS THERE'S A WORK I THINK WE'VE GOT SOME AMENDMENTS FROM THEM THAT WERE PROCESSING WITH OUR BOUNCERS MAKING SURE THAT. WE HAVE THE RIGHT MIX SO I THINK WE'RE MAKING SOME SOME PRETTY GOOD PROGRESS THERE THIS IS AN IMPORTANT BILL FOR CALIFORNIANS. TO ENSURE THAT THEY HAVE. THAT THAT IF THERE'S A JUDGMENT ENTERED AGAINST THEM IT IS THE CORRECT JUDGMENT THAT IS BASED ON THE APPROPRIATE DOCUMENTATION. THAT'S REALLY WHAT THIS BILL DOES AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I.

WHEN A LOW INCOME BORROWERS BASED COLLECTION OF PRIVATE LOANS THEY ARE OFTEN CONFUSED. USUALLY HAVE NEVER HEARD AT THE COLLECTOR OR THE LOAN HOLDERS THAT ARE ASKING THEM TO MAKE A PAYMENT. BECAUSE THE LOAN HOLDERS ARE NOT TYPICALLY BE ORIGINAL CREDITORS MEAN GETTING A LOAN AGREEMENT. THEY USUALLY DON'T HAVE A COPY OF THE LOAN AGREEMENT. OR A PAYMENT HISTORY AND SOMETIMES THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW THEY HAD TAKEN OUT THE PRIVATE NON BECAUSE THEY'RE COMPETING VIEWS ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FEDERAL AND PRIVATE LOANS. EIGHTY FOUR TWENTY FOUR IS A VERY SIMPLE AND COMMON SENSE SOLUTION THAT START TO. LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD IN THE POWER BETWEEN FIREWORK ANYONE COLLECTORS BY BY. REQUIRING AT A MINIMUM AND THAT THE LOAN COLLECTORS ALONE HOLDERS PROVIDE THEM WITH BASIC COLLECTOR LOAN HOLDER SHOULD BE COLLECTING A PRIVATE LOAN WITHOUT AND THESE ARE THE ACTUAL LOAN AGREEMENT SO THE PAYMENT HISTORY.

WITH MANY CALIFORNIANS STRUGGLING WITH ECONOMIC IMPACTS OF CODE NINETEEN IS IMPORTANT THERE ARE STRONG PROTECTIONS TO PREVENT WELL INTENDED BUT MISINFORMED CONSUMERS FROM FALLING INTO WORSE FINANCIAL SITUATIONS. THERE IS LITTLE TO NO REGULATION DEBT SETTLEMENT COMPANIES IN CALIFORNIA CURRENT LAW DOES NOT REFLECT THE CHANGING PRACTICES OF THIS INDUSTRY. WHICH IS MADE IN FOUR SPENT MORE DIFFICULT. THIS LACK OF REGULATION HAS LED TO INCREASED PATISSERIE BEHAVIOR WITHIN THE DEBT SETTLEMENT INDUSTRY. MOREOVER THE LACK OF REGULATION OF THIS GROWING INDUSTRY HAS RESULTED IN CONFUSED AND FRUSTRATED CUSTOMER SPENDING ADDITIONAL MONEY. AND TIME TRYING TO DEAL WITH UNANTICIPATED DEBT COLLECTIONS LAWSUITS. OF THEIR ENROLLED AT. AB FORTINO FIVE WILL MODERNIZE CURRENT LAW TO BETTER REFLECT THE INDUSTRY'S PRACTICES AND IMPROVE REGULATION DEBT SETTLEMENT COMPANIES BY DOING THE FOLLOWING THINGS. MAKE CLEAR THAT ALL DEBT SETTLEMENT COMPANIES OPERATING CALIFORNIA ARE COVERED BY CALIFORNIA LAW. PROVE IT THAT SOME OF THE COMPANIES FROM ENGAGING IN DECEPTIVE AND MISLEADING PRACTICES. REQUIRE CRITICAL DISCLOSURES THAT WOULD ALLOW CONSUMERS TO MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS ABOUT THEIR FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS AND LASTLY PROVIDE CONSUMERS INJURED BY THE BY BAD ACTORS WITH REMEDIES. THERE IS A NEED FOR LEGISLATIVE ACTION TO PROVIDE GUARDRAILS OVER THAT SOMEONE INDUSTRY BEFORE CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF CONSUMERS WHO'VE ALREADY OR ARE CURRENTLY SUFFERING THROUGH THE PANDEMIC AND THE RECESSION. THIS BILLS INTENDED TO PROVIDE PROTECTIONS AND TO SUPPLEMENT THE WORK OF THE DF PI. WITH THE SETTLEMENT OF THE DEPARTMENT THE D. F. P. I.

FIRST I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE- STAFF AND ALL THE MEMBERS WHO. HAVE ENGAGED- ON THIS BILL AND I DON'T SAY THIS ABOUT EVERY BILL AND IT'S ONE OF THESE. ONE OF THESE BILLS WHERE- I HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO TALK TO MOST MEMBERS AND REALLY TAKEN THEIR VALUABLE INPUT. AND HOPES TO MAKE THIS A BETTER ABILITY OR STAFF WHO REALLY DID ENGAGE. THE HELP- WITH CLARIFYING LANGUAGE TO ACHIEVE OUR GOALS. I WANT THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND ALSO WANT TO SAY THAT- WE'RE ACCEPTING THE COMEDIAN.

AND WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR IS GIVING CALIFORNIA THE DEBT FREE SAVINGS ACCOUNT. WITH DIRECT DEPOSIT- AFTER WE'VE DONE THE COMPLETION OF THE MARKET ANALYSIS. WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR IS THE ANSWER. THAT THE COMMUNITIES WERE UNBANKED. OR NOT BANKS. I HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO. TO SAVE WELL TO BE ABLE TO BUY THAT CAR TO BE ABLE TO APPLY FOR CREDIT. AND THAT STARTS IN OUR COMMUNITIES BY HAVING THE ABILITY. TO SAVE DOLLARS. IN A PLACE THAT IS NOT GONNA. BE SOMEONE EVERY SINGLE TIME TO GO BEFORE US ON ACCOUNT. SORT OF MOUNT WEATHER ISN'T OVER DRAFT FEES FOR EVERY SINGLE THING. OF EVERY SINGLE TIME THERE'S NO DROP FURTHER WEATHER ISN'T A PENALTY- WHAT IS THE PENALTY FOR- FOR CERTAIN THINGS. AND SO WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR IS TO CREATE A B. SEVENTY SEVEN- WHICH WOULD NOT CREATE A NEW BANK BUT IT WOULD CREATE A STATE A STATE WIDE RETAIL BANKING OPTION. THROUGH WHICH EVERY CALIFORNIA WOULD HAVE ACCESS TO THE ZERO CLASS FINANCIAL SERVICES. LIKE CHECK CASHING DIRECT DEPOSIT OR DEBIT CARDS. BANK HOLIDAY SIMILAR TO CAL SAVINGS BECAUSE IT WAS IT WOULD USE A NETWORK OF. PARTNER BANKS CREDIT UNIONS PRIVATE FINANCE INSTITUTIONS TO ADMINISTER THE SERVICES. MORE POORLY IT WOULD HELP IF. IT WOULD HELP. CAN I READ THE SIZE OF THE GAN. I TO SERVE THE UNDERBANKED OR UNBANKED POPULATION. ALL THE- LIKE THE COMMUNITIES I REPRESENT. SO MANAGER I THANK YOU. AGAIN I WANT TO EMPHASIZE. THAT THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW US TO MOVE FORWARD TO DO A MARKET ANALYSIS. A VERY RIGID MARKET ANALYSIS THAT WOULD DETERMINE THAT WHAT WE ARE. IF WHAT WE ARE SAYING IS ACCURATE AND WE CAN ESTABLISH. A BANK ACCOUNT THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO COME BACK BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE- TO THE BANKING AND FINANCE COMMITTEE IN THE ASSEMBLY AND THE SENATE. TO BE ABLE THEN TO MOVE FORWARD TO BE ABLE TO ESTABLISH THIS. SO THIS WILL ALLOW US TO PUT THE FIRST PIECE IN PLACE. WOULD YOU BE THAT MARKET ANALYSIS IS CRITICAL TO ESTABLISHING BANK CAL.

I THINK YOU. THANK YOU. NINE FIFTY FOUR PLEASE GO AHEAD.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. LINE FIFTY TWO PLEASE GO AHEAD. DANIEL GUTIERREZ ON BEHALF OF THE CONSUMER FEDERATION OF CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU THERE ARE NO OTHER LINES AND SUPPORT PLEASE CONTINUE THANK YOU VERY MUCH- MODERATOR WE WILL. AS NOW MOVED TO. ANYWAY IT WHEN ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION- OUR FIRST WITNESS AN OPPOSITION IS JASON LANE pASSOCIATION HI JASON PLEASE- PROCEED WHEN YOU ARE READY. THANK YOU MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE WE WOULD LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE EFFORT THAT THE COMMITTEE HAS GONE THROUGH TO IMPROVE AT ELEVEN SEVENTY SEVEN. CERTAINLY THE PRODUCT BEFORE YOU TODAY IS AN IMPROVEMENT OVER PRIOR VERSIONS OF THE BILL. UNFORTUNATELY WE REMAIN OPPOSED TO THIS MEASURE WHICH IS NOW THE THIRD PUBLIC BANKING BILL INTO LEGISLATIVE CYCLES THAT LEGISLATORS HAVE BEEN ASKED TO CONSIDER. CALIFORNIANS ARE SERVED BY NEARLY ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY DIFFERENT BANKS AND TWO HUNDRED NINETY CREDIT UNIONS. MANY OF WHICH ARE ACTIVELY OFFERING LOW TO NO COST. BANKING ACCOUNT OPTIONS SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED TO ASSIST YOUNG BANK TELLER FORMULAS DO NOT LACK ACCESS TO FINANCIAL SERVICES REGARDING YOUNG BANK. EVERY RECENT AVAILABLE FEDERAL STUDY THE FEDERAL RESERVE TO THE FDIC CONCLUDES THAT APPROXIMATELY 5% OF THE US POPULATION REMAINS UNBANKED- AND THAT'S A SIGNIFICANT POPULATION BUT IT CERTAINLY IS NOT- YOU KNOW SIGNIFICANT AS- STATED IN THE BILL- AND THAT'S A POPULATION IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR BANKS CREDIT UNIONS FROM TECH COMPANIES ARE ALL ACTIVELY TRYING TO CAPTURE. BUT HERE'S WHAT THE BILL DOES IT ESTABLISHES A BRAND NEW BUREAUCRACY IN STATE GOVERNMENT THE PUBLIC BANK OPTIONS BOARD TO STUDY A VERY SPECIFIC NARROWLY TAILORED SOLUTION TO A PROBLEM THAT ITSELF HAS. NOT YET BEEN STUDY BY THE LEGISLATURE. IF A LEGISLATOR WE IS JUST. A MILLION DOLLARS ON THE STUDY WE BELIEVE THAT STUDIES SHOULD FOCUS ON THE UNDERLYING UNBANKED PROBLEM WITHOUT USED ABOLITION OF THE PUBLIC BANK OPTIONS FOR WHICH ONCE FORMED WILL BE VERY DIFFICULT TO WIN THE WAR SHE FURTHER WE ARE OPPOSED TO THE NAME OF THE PROGRAM. YOU NOW UNDER THIS PROPOSAL BANK HELL WILL NOT TAKE DEPOSITS IT WILL TAKE DEPOSITS BUT IT WILL SEND THEM TO LOCAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. THAT'S NOT A BANK DEPOSIT BROKER AND NOT ONLY IS IT DECEIVING TO TELL AND WITHIN CALIFORNIA DEPOSITORS THAT THEIR BANKING WITH THE STATE BANK WHEN THEY'RE REALLY HAVING YOUR ACCOUNT MANAGED BY THE VERY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THEY NEVER WANTED TO DO BUSINESS WITH BEGIN WITH. IT'S ALSO A VIOLATION OF FINANCIAL CODE WHICH PROHIBITS THE NAME BANK FROM BEING USED WITHOUT PRIOR AUTHORIZATION. FOR THESE REASONS WE MUST REMAIN. OPPOSED TO THIS MEASURE THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU NEXT WE IN UP. AS ROBERT WILL RIVER THE CALIFORNIA CREDIT UNION LEAGUE ROBERT PLEASE GO AHEAD AND BEGIN WHEN YOU ARE READY. GOOD MORNING CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE PROBLEMS WITH THE CALIFORNIA CREDIT UNION LEAGUE. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO OFFER SOME COMMENTS IN OPPOSITION TO AB ELEVEN SEVENTY SEVEN. YOU START BY TAKING THE CHAIR COMMITTEE STAFF FOR ALL THE WORK THEY PUT IN ON THE SPELL ON THE X. ONE ANALYSIS. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO THANK THE OFFERED SPONSOR TO BE PROVEN TO THIS BILL HAS COME A LONG WAY. PREVIOUS AGREE WITH THE STATEMENT CAN YOU SPELL. TO GET THE- BANKING DON'T FINANCIAL INSTITUTION. AND WE FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT I HAVE A LOT OF LOCAL. HOWEVER WE OPPOSE THE BILL BECAUSE WE BELIEVE IT SIMPLY UNNECESSARY AT THIS POINT. THANK YOU LEON BANK IS PRECISELY WHY CREDIT UNIONS WERE STARTING OVER A HUNDRED YEARS AGO. THREE UNIONS ARE NONPROFIT MEMBER OWNED COOPERATIVES THE GOAL OF SERVING THOSE OF MODEST MEANS. AND I CALLED THE BANK PERCENTAGE TOWARD A UNITED CREDIT UNION IS HEADQUARTERED IN CALIFORNIA. THE REACHING EVERY CORNER OF THE STATE. VAST MAJORITY NEED CREDIT UNIONS. LOW TO NO THE CHECK ACCOUNTS WITH FUTURE SIMILAR THAT OF THE BANK. IN ADDITION TO JOIN A MIGRAINE USES A NETWORK OF A HUNDRED FIFTY BANK WHO ALSO OFFER SIMILAR COUNTS MANY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ALSO PARTICIPATE IN THE AFTER MENTIONED BANK ON PROGRAM WHICH IS RUN BY THE CITIES FOR FINANCIAL EMPOWERMENT. GOING TO SCHOOL IN THE STATE INDEPENDENCE STILL ARE ONE AND THE SAME COULD BE ON BANK BANK. BANK ON DOES WELCOME BANK ON CERTIFIED ACCOUNT EQUITIES BACON AND SOLICITATIONS. THE LOTUS NOTE THE ACCOUNT ALREADY PLEASE MAKE ME WISH WHITE TEETH YOU WILL FEEL. BETTER MORE COST EFFECTIVE LESS BRIDGE LANE APPROACHES TO REDUCE POPULATION. THE CALIFORNIA CREDIT UNION WE BELIEVE THAT THE RECENT CHANGE THE MARKET ANALYSIS WILL SHOW THE AVAILABILITY TO COUNT. AND HOPE THAT THERE'S ROOM FOR A PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN FIFTY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND THE STATE. SPONSORS TO TARGET THE UNBANKED INDIVIDUALS. WE'RE NOT DENYING THAT THERE ARE UNBANKED INDIVIDUALS OUT THERE WAS STILL THERE'S A BETTER WAY TO GET TO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND WE ASK FOR NOTEBOOKS THAT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT WEEK MOVE. WITNESSES IN UP. IN THE GALLERY SCENE NO WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION IN THE GALLERY WE WILL GO AHEAD AND TO MOVE TO WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION IN ROOM ONE TWELVE. SEEN NO WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION IN ROOM ONE TWELVE. WE WILL NOW MOVE TO WITNESSES WAITING TO TESTIFY VIA TELECONFERENCE ORVIS.

THANK YOU IF YOU'D LIKE TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION PLEASE PRESS ONE AND ZERO. WE'LL GO TO LINE FIFTY SIX PLEASE GO AHEAD. GOOD MORNING THIS IS JUSTIN HIGHER WITH THE SILICON VALLEY LEADERSHIP GROUP AND WE MUST RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THE BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS STILL BE JUST THEM. IT'LL BE JUST A MOMENT FOR OUR NEXT ONE. NINE FIFTY EIGHT PLEASE GO AHEAD. BALLERINA REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA CAMBER OF COMMERCE WE ARE NOT POSITIONED TO THE BILL THANK YOU. IT'LL BE JUST A MOMENT HER NEXT ONE. NINE SIXTY TWO PLEASE GO AHEAD- GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE BALLOT COUNTING IS REPRESENTING ALTERNATE CARD SERVICES ALTERNATIVE NOT HAVE AN OFFICIAL SUPPORTER CLOSE POSITION ON A. B. ELEVEN SEVENTY SEVEN. HOWEVER THEY ARE CURRENTLY IN THE THIRD BUCKET THAT SUPPORTS THE GOALS OF THE BILL BUT HAVE CONCERNS GLOBAL TURN ALREADY OFFERS PRODUCTS FOR THE TARGETED CUSTOMERS OF THE BILL. WILL TURN AS AN FDIC INSURED PREPAID FINANCIAL SERVICES PRODUCTS THAT PROVIDE CONSUMER FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS WITHOUT ALL THE OWNERS SPEAK WITH THOSE OTHER PRODUCTS. WE LOOK FORWARD TO ONGOING CONVERSATIONS WITH THE AUTHOR AND INTERESTED STAKEHOLDERS AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD THROUGH THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU. THERE ARE NO FURTHER LINES IN OPPOSITION ALL RIGHT WITH NO ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION OF THE BILL WE WILL- MOVE THIS TO MEMBER DISCUSSION I MEMBERS ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS IN A SEA OF A FEW SO I OPENED A FEW ALL A LOT. AND SO I WILL START WITH AN INTERMITTENT. THANK YOU MA'AM CHAIR- I APPRECIATE THE INTENT OF THIS BILL- FOUR GLOBAL SAVINGS HOUSEHOLDS HAVING A BANK ACCOUNT IS SO CRITICAL TO WEALTH BUILDING. FOR MANY OF US WE TAKE A BANK ACCOUNT FOR GRANTED- BUT IT'S WHEN YOU HAVE LOW SAVINGS- YOU'RE DEALING WITH A POTPOURRI OF ALTERNATIVE FINANCIAL PRODUCTS. THERE'S A REASON THAT PAYDAY LENDERS ARE USED IS NOT BECAUSE HOUSEHOLDS ARE STUPID THEY KNOW ABOUT THE HIGH RATES- BUT THERE ARE FOR THEM. FOR MANY HOUSEHOLDS PAYDAY LENDERS CAN CHECK CASHING SERVICES AND OTHER SIMILAR FINANCIAL. SERVICES PROVIDERS- PROVIDE A SERVICE TO AT EIGHT IF NET FEE THAT IS LOWER THAN OPENING A TRADITIONAL BANK ACCOUNT. WITH THE HIGH OVERDRAFT FEES THE LOW BALANCE FEES AND THE NUMBER OF CHARGES ASSOCIATED WITH HAVING THOSE- AND WE'VE MADE TREMENDOUS PROGRESS IN LAST DECADE I'M JUST GONNA NOTE I THINK ONE OF THE OPPOSITION WEAKNESSES. I NOTED THAT IN A RECENT FDIC SURVEY WE HAD REACHED. A POINT IN WHICH ONLY FIVE POINT 4% OF AMERICANS ARE NOW ON BANK. BUT WE STILL HAVE A LONG WAYS TO GO THAT SAME SURVEY ALSO FOUND THAT OVER 20% OF AMERICANS ARE UNDERBANKED OR UNBANKED. WHICH MEANS THAT THEY ARE STILL VIEWING BANK ACCOUNTS AS A NECESSARY EVIL IS SOMETHING THEY HAVE TO HAVE BUT THEY'RE STILL RELYING HEAVILY PRODUCTS- SO I THINK THIS IS AN IMPORTANT POLICY GOAL. AND WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT ALL OPTIONS AND I APPRECIATE THE WAY IN WHICH THE AUTHOR STRUCTURED THIS BILL. AS A STUDY A MARKET ANALYSIS OF THE FEASIBILITY OF ONE TYPE OF OPTION. THAT MIGHT SERVE AS A COMPLEMENT TO SOME OF THE FINTECH AND OTHER PRODUCTS THAT ARE DEVELOPING RIGHT NOW. I WOULD JUST SAY I APPRECIATE pMEANS THAT HE'S TAKEN- I MIGHT SUGGEST- ADDITIONAL. DIRECTIONAL APPROACHES HERE FIRST I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT WE TALK ABOUT THE CRITERIA. THAT THIS BOARD IS SUPPOSED TO LOOK AT IN DEVELOPING ITS PROPOSAL THAT. IT LOOK AT SAFETY AND SOUNDNESS AS A INDEPENDENT PILLAR- THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT ANYTHING WE THINK ABOUT AS A LEGISLATIVE BODY IN THE STATE GOVERNMENT- THAT MIGHT HAVE. THE IMPRIMATUR OF THE STATE BEHIND IT- NEEDS TO MAKE YOU NEED TO FIRST AND FOREMOST BE SOMETHING THAT'S SAFE AND SOUND THAT WILL NOT IMPLODE. BECAUSE THIS IS NOT GONNA BE A TRADITIONAL BANK IF WE DO THIS- AS I UNDERSTAND THE STRUCTURE WILL BE A PRIVATE INSTITUTION- BUT WITH A LOT OF STATE BACKING BEHIND IT- THE SECOND THING I THINK. THAT WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT ENSURING AS PART OF THIS PROPOSAL IS CONSUMER PROTECTION. SINCE THIS IS GOING TO BE DELEGATED TO PRIVATE INSTITUTION OR NETWORK OF A SERIES OF PRIVATE ACTORS. I WANNA MAKE SURE THE CONSUMER PROTECTION IS A CORE PART OF WHAT'S BEING LOOKED AT SO I HOPE THAT THE AUTHOR WILL CONSIDER. ADOPTING THESE APPROACHES AS HE MOVES THIS BILL OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE INTO APPROPRIATIONS BUT- I INTEND TO VOTE I TODAY BECAUSE I THINK WE REALLY SHOULD BE LOOKING AT ALL OPTIONS WHEN IT COMES TO. HOW WE SERVE THE UNBANKED AND UNDERBANKED THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU I HAVE SENATOR. WEST SO THEN US SENATOR COMING INTO. THANK YOU MADAM. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT. AND FIRST OF ALL I'D LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE- WHOEVER PUT TOGETHER THIS ANALYSIS WAS ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT VERY WELL DONE LOT OF WORK INVESTED I REALLY APPRECIATE HAVING ACCESS TO THAT AMOUNT OF INFORMATION SO FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU FOR THAT. ALSO TO THE AUTHOR OF THIS BILL THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONTINUED EFFORTS IN THIS AREA I THINK IT'S ESSENTIAL THAT WE CONTINUE TO WORK TOWARD THIS GOAL THAT FOR THE FOR THE OPPONENTS OF THIS MEASURE THERE REALLY IS NOTHING TO OPPOSE NOTHING TO FEAR IT'S JUST A- THE ARGUMENTS THAT ARE PROPOSED- ALMOST- YOU KNOW IT. I DON'T EVEN WANT TO PUT IN AN A WORD ON IT HONESTLY BECAUSE I THINK IT'S JUST SAD THAT WE'RE GETTING OPPOSITION. TO WANNA FURTHER BANK. CALIFORNIANS WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE FIVE POINT FOUR FIGURE NATIONWIDE A NATIONWIDE FIGURE WAS YOU WHOSE BECAUSE CALIFORNIA'S GENERALLY IS GOING TO BE MUCH HIGHER IN THIS AREA. AND WE'RE LOOKING AT THREE MILLION PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA COMPLETELY. UNBANKED ABSOLUTELY ZERO ACCESS TO BANKING SERVICES AND WHEN YOU CONSIDER POOR PEOPLE AND WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THEIR DEPOSITS GO TO ACTUALLY PAY IN FEES. VERSUS SOMEBODY THAT HAS HEALTHY DEPOSITS AND HIGHER INCOME IT'S COMPLETELY UNFAIR IT'S NOT A FAIR SYSTEM OFTEN TIMES IF YOU HAVE HIGHER DEPOSITS. YOU WILL PAY LESS FEE FEES UNLESS BANKING COSTS SO THIS SYSTEM. IS ALREADY DESIGNED. TO GO CONTRARY IN IN IN IN NOT SUPPORTING PEOPLE THAT WE SHOULD BE SUPPORTING TO GET INTO OUR ECONOMY HELPING THEM TO GET- MAKE FINANCIAL PLANNING LONG TERM FLYKNIT-FINANCIAL PLANNING DECISIONS THAT HELP THEM. UP HAVE MORE PROSPERITY OVER THE FUTURE SO I'M SORRY. TO THE BNKING INDUSTRY OUT THERE OUR SYSTEM RIGHT NOW IS JUST NOT WORKING FOR THE PEOPLE THAT WE'RE TRYING TO HELP TO TRY TO HELP PEOPLE TO GET ACCESS TO THE AMERICAN DREAM HELP TO. HELP THEM TO MAKE WISER PLANNING DECISIONS AND BANKING IS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THAT. WHEN YOU CONSIDER THAT 90% OF THE BUSINESSES THAT APPLY FOR BUSINESS LOANS DON'T GET IT. SAID NUMBER. FOR ANYBODY TO COME TO US HERE AND SAY THAT NOTHING NEEDS TO BE DONE THAT EVERYTHING IS PERFECT HE'S NOT THINKING OF THE 90% OF THE BUSINESSES. OVER THE YEARS THERE BEEN DIFFERENT INITIATIVES EITHER THROUGH GOVERNMENT OR THROUGH BANKS THAT HAVE INCREASED ELIGIBILITY AND THE RESULTS WERE THAT THE REPAYMENT RATES INCREASED SO IF YOU ACTUALLY INCREASE ELIGIBILITY THE REPAYMENT RATES TO LEASE LOANS ARE GOING TO ACTUALLY INCREASE THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IS VERY COMPELLING THAT REQUIRES US TO MOVE TOWARD THIS. NORTH DAKOTA HAS BEEN DOING THIS SINCE SINCE NINETEEN FIFTEEN AND NOBODY'S BEEN TRYING TO UNDO THE NORTH DAKOTA BANKS IT IS IT IS DOES NOT I THINK THIS BILL. IS LEANING IN THAT DIRECTION TO START STUDY SOMETHING THAT COULD POTENTIALLY WORK LIKE NORTH DAKOTA. AND BANKERS LOVE THE NORTH DAKOTA BANKS SO WHY DO THEY HATE THIS PROPOSAL IN CALIFORNIA. THE WHAT I'VE SEEN IS THAT ANYTHING HERE THAT EVEN INSINUATES ANY KIND OF COMPETITION. IS JUST COMPLETELY REFUTED AND IN AND HAVING TO PRESENT THIS AS A NEW BUREAUCRACY AND NOT A NEW BUSINESS AND INITIATIVE IS JUST JUST. ANOTHER EXAMPLE. OF WHY. THIS OPPOSITION IS COMPLETELY COMPLETELY WRONG SO THIS NOBODY SHOULD FEAR A STUDY NOBODY SHOULD- FEAR FURTHER ANALYSIS NOBODY SHOULD FEAR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. TRYING TO CREATE A PROGRAM TO BANK MORE OF ITS UP MORE OF ITS COMMUNITY NOBODY SHOULD FEAR THAT THIS SHOULD BE SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE RALLY AROUND I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYTHING FOR THE BANKING COMMUNITY FEAR I UNDERSTAND. WHY THEY'RE NOT POSITION I UNDERSTAND THE COMMENTS BUT- THE REALLY THE ARGUMENTS IN OPPOSITION OF THIS BILL ARE EXTREMELY WEAK LET'S STUDY IT LET'S LOOK AT IT LET LET IF THE- IF IT'S SEEN AS NON VIABLE THEN THAT'S THAT GIVES US A DECISION AND- BUT IF IT PROVIDES US DIRECTION. WHY NOT ENGAGE THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY MOVE SOMETHING THAT MAKES MORE SENSE AND HELP THE PEOPLE OF OUR STATE- HAVE BETTER BANKING SERVICE OR AT LEAST HAVE AN OPTION THAT'S CURRENTLY NOT AVAILABLE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS SITE I SUPPORT THIS MEASURE THE PROPER TIME I'D LIKE TO MOVE FORWARD. THANK YOU SENATOR WESSEL SO WE DO HAVE A MOTION BY SENATOR WEST SO I HAVE SENATOR COVEY IT'LL SENATOR BRADFORD AND THEN SENT OVER THE REST OF. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR- I WANT TO ALIGN MY COMMENTS WITH THOSE OF SENATOR MINUTES SENATOR WEST SO I THINK THEY MADE SOME SOME REALLY GOOD COMMENTS ABOUT. THE NEED FOR BANKING SERVICES FOR THOSE THAT. ARE UNBANKED OR THEY DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES AND IT IT IS ALWAYS BEEN A POINT O CONTENTION WITH ME THAT IF YOU HAVE ENOUGH MONEY AND YOU CAN LEAVE IT IN A SAVINGS ACCOUNT YOUR SERVICES ARE FOR FREE. INCLUDING INCLUDING IN MANY INSTANCES THE ABILITY TO TAKE MONEY OUT OF THE BANK AND USE THAT. DEBIT CARD. AND IF YOU DON'T HAVE MONEY AND ALL YOU HAVE IS A DEBIT CARD WITH WITH MONEY IN THE BANK YOU PAY FOR EVERYTHING. EVERYTHING THAT YOU DO IF YOU'RE USING THAT DEBIT CARD YOU PAY. AND TO ME IT JUST SEEMS LIKE IT'S BACKWARDS- I CERTAINLY WOULDN'T. MIND LEAVE HAVING MONEY IN THE BANK AND ALLOWING THAT TO BE USED TO. PAY FOR SOMEONE ELSE'S DEBIT CARD USE- RATHER THAN MY OWN BUT IN ANY CASE- THERE ARE A COUPLE AND I WANT TO. RECOGNIZE AND THANK THE AUTHOR FOR. HAVING PERSONAL CONVERSATIONS WITH ALL OF US SO THAT WE COULD GET OUR QUESTIONS ANSWERED. AND AND REALLY HAVE INPUT IN TERMS OF HOW HE'S THINKING ABOUT THIS- IT IT SAM. THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT THIS IS- THAT THIS IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY BUT IT'S GOT. IT'S GOT TO BE GROUNDED IN- IN- FISCAL. SINCE AND SO I REALLY DO APPRECIATE THAT THE COMMENTS BY SENATOR MENU REGARDS TO SAFETY AND SOUNDNESS IT'S WHAT THE BANKS HAVE TO. HAVE TO COMPLY WITH AND CONSUMER PROTECTION REALLY DOES HAVE TO BE- OUR NUMBER ONE. CONCERN FOR DOING IT TO MEET CONSUMER NEEDS AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WE'RE TAKE WE'RE PROTECTING THEM SO. TWO THINGS ONE IS. I REALLY WANT THIS MARKET ANALYSIS TO BE ROBUST THAT WE'RE REALLY LOOKING AT WHAT ARE THE COSTS OF PROVIDING THE SERVICES. AND IS THERE A WAY TO BE ABLE TO DO IT SO THAT THE COST IS MINIMAL AND IT'S ON. IT IT CONTRIBUTES TO THE SAFETY AND SOUNDNESS OF THE PROGRAM- SO IF YOU KNOW MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE WE'RE ASKING THE RIGHT QUESTIONS IN DOING THIS- WHAT KIND OF SERVICES SHOULD BE OFFERED WHAT ARE THE COST OF THE SERVICES WHETHER. THEIR DIRECT DEPOSIT AUTOMATIC PAYMENTS OR ELECTRONIC PAYMENTS DEBIT CARDS ALL OF THAT REALLY PRACTICAL THINGS THAT. BOMB THAT WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO COVER BY THIS KIND OF A OF A SERVICE. AND THEN I HAVE A QUESTION- FOR THE AUTHOR AND I BECAUSE IT JUST WASN'T CLEAR TO ME IN IN READING THIS. WHETHER WHETHER THE ISSUE COMES BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE. OUGHT TO APPROVE A PROPOSED PROGRAM WEDNESDAY- MARKET ANALYSIS IS DONE IT'S NOT CLEAR IT SOUNDS LIKE YES WE DO- AND I'M HOPING WE DO IT BECAUSE I THINK WE ALL NEED TO TAKE PERSONAL- RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE FACT THAT IF IT'S GOING TO WORK- WE GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE- DOTS THAT I'S ARE DOTTED AND THE TEASER CROSSED AND SO. ON I WANT TO I'M GOING TO SUPPORT IT TODAY I THINK IT'S- THE WAY THAT THE AUTHOR IS GONE ABOUT CONSTRUCTING THIS BILL IS REALLY HELPFUL. AND AND WITH THAT I'D I'D THAT'S THE ONLY QUESTION THAT I HAVE THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU A SUNBURST MONTANA WOULD YOU LIKE TO ADDRESS THAT YES AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH DONE TO MIKE- CALLING FROM SALINAS. WHO REALLY ENGAGED IN THE CONVERSATION AND I'M THE SAME PERSON REALLY QUICKLY I THINK YOU HIT ON THE MAIL THIS WE WANT THIS TO BE A VERY SOLID POLICY PROPOSAL. THAT WHICH STANDS- THE FISCAL PRESSURES OF ESTABLISHING A PLATFORM THAT BANKS FOLKS- AND WE ALSO WANTED TO HAVE LONGEVITY AND DO THE THINGS THAT WE WANTED TO DO SO I HAVE. EVERY INTENTION. THAT THE MARKET ANALYSIS WILL ACHIEVE THAT- BECAUSE I WANT TO WORK I DON'T WANT TO FAIL. ON MONDAY WHAT IT WOULD. DEFEAT THE PURPOSE- SO I JUST WANNA SAY THAT OUT LOUD BECAUSE THERE IS THAT'S WHAT WE WANT AND- IN IN TERMS OF. COMING BACK TO LEGISLATURE YES- TO ME IT'S CLEAR AND THE CHAIR CAN CONFIRM THAT THERE IS LANGUAGE THAT WE STARTED- SINCE- THE ASSEMBLY TO ENSURE THAT IT COMES BACK TO THE- SENATE AND THE ASSEMBLY BANKING FINANCE COMMITTEE- WHERE THE MARKET ANALYSIS- WILL NOT ONLY HAVE BEEN. HOW WILL IT HAD PUBLIC HEARINGS BUT IT WILL HAVE- IT'LL BE VETTED BY BOTH COMMITTEES. IT'S A FIFTY MARKET ANALYSIS COMES BACK AND SAYS. WHAT YOU ARE SAYING IS NOT GOING TO WORK. IT'S A NEW SUBJECT WILL MOVE FOR. BUT IT pTHE WAY WE SAY IT'S GOING TO WORK. ON THE COMMITTEES HAVE THE ABILITY. TO MOVE THIS FORWARD SO THAT WE CAN BEGIN TO ESTABLISH IT BUT IT WILL STILL NEED LEGISLATIVE APPROVAL. LIKEWISE IF THE MARKET ANALYSIS COMES BACK- AS IS THE LEGISLATURE'S PRODUK PRODUCT PRODUCT SO I MIGHT ASK YOU TO CONSTRUCT MY MOUSE I APOLOGIZE ABOUT THAT. AS IS THE LEGISLATURE'S PRODIGY IF THERE ARE DEFICIENCIES WE ALSO HAVE THE ABILITY- TO ADDRESS THOSE DEFICIENCIES WHEN IT COMES BACK BECAUSE- IT HAS TO BE VOTED ON pUNDERSTAND STAND IN MADAM CHAIR CAN CONFIRM- AS I UNDERSTOOD HIM LAST MAY UNDERSTAND THIS COMMITTEE. BEFORE IT WAS FOR. AND I WILL CONFIRM THAT AT IS AS IS WRITTEN TO DATE- THIS BILL I'M SORRY THE MARKET ANALYSIS CONDUCTED BY THE TREASURER'S OFFICE DOES NEED TO COME BACK TO BOTH THE ASSEMBLY AND SENATE BANKING AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS- TO DECIDE TO TERMINATE HOW TO PROCEED ONCE THE ANALYSIS IS COMPLETED. AND DID THAT ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS IN ORDER TO YES I IT DID I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT IT'S NOT JUST THE COMMITTEES AND THEN THEY GO YEAH THAT'S A GOOD IDEA AND THAT'S IT- I'M ASSUMING THAT IT WHAT WHAT WILL COME BACK IS A IS A PROPOSAL AND THEN IT pOTHER THE OTHER THING IS THAT I ALSO THINK WE NEED TO GIVE THE COMMITTEE. THE FLEXIBILITY TO MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS ABOUT HOW WE MIGHT WANT TO. CHANGE THE PROGRAM IF IT. IF IT NEEDS IT IN OTHER WORDS IF THAT MARKET ANALYSIS COMES BACK AND SAYS. LOOK THIS DOESN'T WORK. BUT IF YOU DO IT THIS WAY. IT COULD WORK I THAT THE BID COMMITTEE SHOULD BE ABLE TO RECOMMEND TO US A DIFFERENT PATHWAY THAT WOULD GET US WHERE WE WANT TO GO. UNDERSTANDING WHAT WE WANT TO DO. IS TO PROVIDE SERVICES. SO THAT- SO THAT EVERYONE IN THE STATE THAT NEEDS A BANKING SERVICE CAN GET IT SOMEWHERE. YES YES AND I WILL CLARIFY THAT THE MARKET ANALYSIS COMES BACK TO THE COMMITTEES BUT IN REALITY WHAT HAPPENS WHAT HAS TO HAPPEN IS THERE WILL NEED TO BE OF THE BILL. VERY GOOD- AFTER THE MARKET ANALYSIS IS PRESENTED. I THANK YOU THAT BAD SO THAT HELPS ME YEAH. AND NOW WE HAVE A SENATOR BRADFORD THEN SENATOR- THAT ALSO. THANK YOU MANAGER AND I TOO WILL ONLINE MY COMMENTS WITH. MY PREVIOUS. COMMENTS BY MY COLLEAGUES WHO HAVE PREVIOUSLY SPOKEN ON THIS MATTER. AND MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO CITY COULDN'T FIND THE WORDS TO DESCRIBE THE BANKING JOB POSITION AND LET ME JUST ADD IT I THINK IT'S LAUGHABLE AS THE FORMER BANKING CHEER I AM JUST BLOWN AWAY AT THE CONTINUED OPPOSITION TO LOOKING AT ALTERNATIVE METHODS I'M ALSO CHALLENGED APPS SOME OF US AS LEGISLATORS WHO. HAVE STOOD IN THE WAY OF SOME OF THOSE OTHER VEHICLES THAT ARE NOW AVAILABLE IN THE EXIT SIMPLY BECAUSE OUR TRADITIONAL BANKING WAS NOT SERVING THOSE CUSTOMERS THAT'S WHY WE HAVE ONLINE NINETY NOW THAT'S WHY WE HAVE PAYDAY LOANS THAT'S WHY THOSE FOUR MARKETS EXIST NOW IN CALIFORNIAACROSS THE COUNTRY BECAUSE TRADITIONAL BANKING WAS NOT. PROVIDING SERVICES TO THESE INDIVIDUALS AND EIGHT YEARS AGO AS A MEMBER OF THE ASSEMBLY I AUTHORED A BILL LOOKING AT THE UNDERBANKED CALIFORNIANS AND WAS SPONSORED BY ARDEN AND LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR NOW GOVERNOR GAVIN NEWSOM. AND WE HAD THE SAME LEVEL PUSH BACK EIGHT YEARS AGO AND HERE WE ARE TODAY STILL TALKING ABOUT HOW DO WE SERVE THE MILLIONS OF UNBANKED CALIFORNIANS THAT EXISTS HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT. INTEREST RATES BANKING INTEREST RATES FOR OVERDRAFT PROTECTION- OVER DRAFTING SO YOU GO TO STARBUCKS WITH YOUR DEBIT CARD IN YOUR DOLLAR SHORT YOU'RE GONNA PAY TWENTY SIX DOLLARS. OVERDRAFT FEES BECAUSE YOU WERE. A DOLLAR SHORT THAT'S A THOUSAND OVER A WERE SQUABBLING THAT- LAST YEAR IN THE LAST TWO YEARS ABOUT THAN WHAT THE BANK CHARGES. AND THAT'S WHY MANY OF THESE FOLKS ARE AWAY FROM THE BANK BECAUSE THEY CAN'T AFFORD AS YOU STATED. FEES BANKS MAKE THE MAJORITY OF THEIR PROFIT OFF OF FEES AND SERVICES. I TRULY MAKE THE MAJORITY OF THEIR MONEY OFF OF FEES AND OVERDRAFT PROTECTION. CHARGES SO THIS IS A COMMON SENSE MEASURE THAT'S LONG OVERDUE WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT IT. FAR TOO LONG AND WE DO NEED TO PROVIDE ALTERNATIVE METHODS FOR INDIVIDUALS TO COME INTO. MAINSTREAM AMERICA AND HOW THE BANKING ACCOUNT HAVE A CHECKING ACCOUNT EVEN LOOKING AT THE NUMBER OF HOME LOANS THAT ARE PROVIDED TO. PEOPLE OF COLOR THEY'RE FAR LESS. OUR BANK INSTITUTIONS PROVIDE FEWER LOANS TO LATINOS AND AFRICAN AMERICANS INTO THE GROUP HERE IN THIS NATION WE HAD A HEARING- TWO YEARS AGO WHEN I WAS BANKING CHEER AND ONLY ONE BANK WAS WILLING TO SHOW UP AND HAVE A DISCUSSION. ON THEIR LENDING PRACTICES TO MINORITIES IN IT WAS WELLS FARGO AND I COMMEND THEM FOR THAT THE REST OF THE BANK'S ANYONE OF A DISCUSSION ON. HOW THEY WERE LONG LESS THAN 20% OF HOME LOANS TO AFRICAN AMERICANS OR LATINOS SO I THINKTHIS IS A- MEASURE WHICH TIME IS COMING ICE STRONGLY SUPPORTED. THANK YOU SENATOR BRADFORD AS SENATOR IT ALSO. I THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND- EVERY ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES HERE WHO SPOKE I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH- AND I DO WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. BLACK AND LATINO HOUSEHOLDS ARE SIX TIMES MORE LIKELY TO BE UNBANKED THAN WHITE HOUSEHOLDS. THEY CAN'T AFFORD THE FEES. BUT THEIR MONEY IS IN THAT BANK. HOW RIDICULOUS IS THAT. SO YOU HAVE TO PAY 3510% OF THEIR PAYCHECKS JUST TO GET ACCESS TO THE MONDAY. THAT'S THERE'S- THE DECK IS STACKED AGAINST LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. THESE ARE THE COMMUNITIES WHERE THE PEOPLE WORK HARD JOBS FRONT LINES OF THE ECONOMY LITTLE PAY. VERY LITTLE IF ANY SAFETY NET THESE ARE THE PEOPLE THAT NEED THE MOST SERVICE AND FRANKLY THERE WAS SOME COMMENTS BY I THINK THE OPPOSITION WITNESSES THAT MADE IT SOUND LIKE EVERYTHING'S OKAY. AND IT'S OUTRAGEOUS I'M I'M OFFENDED BY IT WHY HASN'T THE OPPONENTS DONE ANYTHING AND ENOUGH TO DATE. IF YOU'RE NOT GONNA DO IT IF THAT'S NOT GOING TO BE WHERE YOU ARE YOU THINK YOU CAN MAKE YOUR MONEY THEN STEP ASIDE STEP ASIDE AND LET ANOTHER INSTITUTION DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT SO. THANK YOU TO THE AUTHOR AND THANK YOU TO ALL MY COLLEAGUES FOR THEIR REMARKS THANK YOU SENATOR THAT ALSO. ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS- SEE NO ADDITIONAL COMMENTS- A DO YOU WANT TO. YOU COULD YOU KNOW COME INTO- THE AUTHOR FOR WORKING ON THIS BILL AND I THINK THIS BILL RESPONDS TO A VERY IMPORTANT FUNDAMENTAL ISSUED TO THE CONCEPT OF FINANCIAL INCLUSION AND FINANCIAL WELL BEING- MANY OF US WHO HAVE BANK ACCOUNTS- SOMETIMES TAKE THEM FOR GRANTED- WERE NOT REMINDED EVERY WEEK EVERY TRANSACTION EVERY MONTH A MONTH- THE BURDEN AND COST OF GETTING A PAYCHECKS CASHED AND GETTING. MONEY ORDERS TO PAY RENT- BUT HAVING A BANK ACCOUNT IS OFTEN A PREREQUISITE ALSO FOR BUILDING HEALTHY FINANCIAL. THIS IS ESTABLISHING A HEALTHY FINANCIAL LIFE BANK ACCOUNTS OFTEN SERVE AS A FIRST STEP IS TO MAINSTREAM FINANCIAL SERVICES- CONSUMERS CAN GET LOANS. CAR IN AND PURCHASE A CAR OR A HOUSE THROUGH BANKS AND SO I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE WHAT IT MEANS TO BOTH HAVE A BANK ACCOUNT BUT ALSO NOT HAVE A BANK ACCOUNT- IN THE LIMITING OPPORTUNITIES. WE KNOW THAT BANK ACCOUNTS CAN BE RISKY FOR SOME CONSUMERS ESPECIALLY IF THEIR BANK OR CREDIT UNION CHARGES HIGH FEES- IN OVERDRAFT AND I THINK THAT THAT'S BEEN A COLLECTIVE SENTIMENT. ON IT YOU KNOW OF THIS COMMITTEE SO WHILE THIS IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE. WE REALLY HAVE TO ASK OURSELVES WHAT OPTIONS DO WE HAVE TO ADDRESS IT AND I BELIEVE THAT BY SUPPORTING THIS BILL WEEK KNOWLEDGE OF THE CHALLENGES OF MBANK CALIFORNIANS IS A PROBLEM. IT IS A PROBLEM THAT NEEDS INVESTIGATION AND IS A PROBLEM THAT THIS LEGISLATURE NEEDS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND. AND THEN CERTAINLY THE SUPPORT OF THIS BILL IS NOT JUST TO THINK OF THE ONE OPTION BUT TO THINK OF THE VARIOUS OPTIONS AT THIS MARKET ANALYSIS CAN BRING FORWARD WE NEED TO ADDRESS A SERIOUS ISSUE. I DO LOOK FORWARD TO THE RESULTS OF THE MARKET ANALYSIS WHICH I HOPE WILL PROVIDE THE LEGISLATURE WITH BETTERINFORMATION ON HOW WE NEED TO ACT AND HOW WE NEED TO MOVE FORWARD. I WILL ALSO NOTE THAT WE NOW HAVE TWO SIGNIFICANT EFFORTS UNDER WAY UNDER WAY TO TEST WHETHER GOVERNMENT CAN ADD VALUE TO THE FINANCIAL SERVICES SPACE. TWO YEARS AGO WE ENACTED AB EIGHT FIVE SEVEN TO ALLOW LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO PURSUE PUBLIC BANKS IN THEIR JURISDICTION. NOW WE HAVE THIS BILL- AND ATE IT THAT LOOKS TO MOVE FORWARD TO SEE HOW THE STATE CAN ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF UNBANKED CALIFORNIANS. I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO. SUPPORT THESE EFFORTS AND SEE HOW THEY PLAY OUT. BUT BEFORE CLOSING I ALSO WANT TO EXTEND MY GRATITUDE TO- OUR TREASURE- OFF FOR NOT SHYING AWAY FROM THIS CHALLENGE. THIS. THIS ISSUE WILL WANT TO SEE THEIR VIEWS REFLECTED IN THE STUDY. I HOPE THAT AS MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE- WE'RE GOING TO BUT NOT JUST ASK OUR TREASURE TO CONDUCT THIS STUDY BUT ENSURE- THAT THE TREASURER HAS THE SUFFICIENT MEANS. TO BE ABLE TO CONDUCT A THOROUGH EVIDENCE BASED STUDY- FOR THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY FORTY MILLION PEOPLE THAT IS NOT LITTLE. AND SO I THINK THAT WE REALLY NEED TO ENSURE THAT THAT THIS IS DONE WELL. AND OFTEN IS THE CASE YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR AND SO I HOPE WE DON'T SHORT CHANGE. THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS STUDY AND I DO. WANT TO RECOGNIZE- THAT ALL OF THE SUPPORTERS AND ALSO THE OPPOSITION HAS MADE MANY POINTS- ABOUT WHAT CAN COME OUT OF THE STUDY AND IT'S CERTAINLY. DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES NEED TO BE INCLUDED. I DO WANT TO RECOGNIZE- THAT AMONG YOU KNOW THIS BODY WE HAVE FELT THAT THE SAFETY AND SOUNDNESS CONSUMER PROTECTIONS- AND COST. TO ADD TO INSURE ITS COST TO CONSUMERS TO ACCESS. THESE PRODUCTS WHATEVER OPTIONS ARE PRODUCTS ARE OUT THERE ARE ALSO OF GREAT IMPORTANCE- AND I DO WANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT OUR FORMER CHAIR HAS TALKED FOR MANY OF YEARS. ABOUT THE UNBANKED AND THEY NEED. TO DO MORE SO I HOPE- DATA THE MESSAGE IS VERY CLEAR ON WHERE THIS BODY STANDS- IN TERMS OF CONSIDERING THIS A SERIOUS ISSUE THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED. SO WITH THAT- WE WILL GO AHEAD AND- IF THERE ARE NO FURTHER COMMENTS WE WILL GO AHEAD AND- TAKE A VOTE ON THE BILL WE HAVE A MOTION BY US SENATOR WESSEL.
