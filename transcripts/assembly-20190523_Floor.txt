MR MEDINA YOU ARE RECOGNIZED OPEN ON THIS MATTER. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER IN MEMBERS TODAY I PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL. THREE THIRTY ONE A BILL THAT WILL REQUIRE AN CHORUS OF ETHNIC STUDIES. TO BE A HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION REQUIREMENTS. BEGINNING IN THE SCHOOL YEAR. TWENTY TWENTY FOUR TWENTY TWENTY FIVE STUDIES HAVE PROVEN THAT THE EFFECT ON STUDENTS WITH THE COURSE. IN ETHNIC STUDIES IMPROVES NOT ONLY ATTENDANCE BUT ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT. THIS MEASURE IS SUPPORTED BY THE ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDER LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS. THE LEGISLATIVE LATINO CAUCUS THE LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS. AND THE LEGISLATIVE JEWISH CAUCUS. AS WELL AS BY THE NATIVE AMERICAN CAUCUS. YESTERDAY AS WE TALKED ABOUT. CHARTER SCHOOLS WE BROUGHT UP THE IMPORTANCE. OF THE LA STUDENT WALK OUT IN NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT BY LATINO STUDENTS. WE CELEBRATE MANY. HOLIDAYS IN THIS CHAMBER. WE HAVE MANY. COMMEMORATIONS OF HISTORICAL EVENTS. BUT YET WHEN WE CELEBRATED HERE WE DON'T GIVE HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS THE SAME OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN ABOUT THOSE SAME EVENTS. VERY RECENTLY THE CONNECTICUT LEGISLATURE. PASSED A BILL TO MAKE. LATINO AND BLACK STUDIES. OFFERING IT TO THE CONNECTICUT STUDENTS. AND WHEN THEY DID THAT ONE OF THE MEMBERS ON THAT CHAMBER GOT UP. ANY PAPER CLIPPED. A VERY CURRENT US HISTORY BOOK THAT IS USED IN IN CONNECTICUT. THE PAPER CLIP HOW MANY PAGES FOCUSED ON AFRICAN AMERICAN HISTORY. IN THIS COUNTRY. AND I CAN TELL YOU I HAVEN'T BEEN A U. S. HISTORY TEACHER THAT IS VERY FEW PAGES WE ARE [inaudible] IN A STATE LIKE CALIFORNIA WITH SUCH DIVERSITY. IT IS BEYONDTIME THAT ALL STUDENTS ARE GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY. TO LEARN ESSENTIAL HISTORY OF THIS STATE AND THIS NATION. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AYE VOTE ON A. B.. THREE THIRTY ONE YOU MISTER MEDINA DOCTOR WEBER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED TO SPEAK ON THIS MATTER. YES I REALIZE IS A PROUD CO AUTHOR OF AB -- THREE THIRTY ONE THAT WOULD BRING ETHNIC STUDIES TO A HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS YEAH WE'VE TALKED A LOT IN THIS IN AS POINTED OUT BY THE AUTHOR WE'VE TALKED A LOT IN THIS HOUSE ABOUT ETHNIC STUDIES AND CELEBRATING BLACK HISTORY MONTH API MONTH WITH THAT YOU KNOW THE CHICANO MONTH. WE GO ON AND ON WITH THIS DISCUSSION AND BECOMES NO MORE THAN RELIGIOUS CEREMONIAL STATEMENT AND IF WE REALLY BELIEVE THAT ARE THAT WE NEED A HISTORY THAT IS UPDATED THAT OUR CHILDREN NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE TOLD TOTAL HISTORY OF CALIFORNIA. AND THE WONDER AND BEAUTY OF ITS DIVERSITY AS WELL AS WHAT IT HAS DONE WHEN IT HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED. TO RESTORE CONFIDENCE IN STUDENTS THEN WE NEED TO DO THIS THIS IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT. YOU KNOW THIS PAST WEEKEND I WAS HONORED BY MY STUDENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY FOR FORTY YEARS OF OF DEVELOPING A PROGRAM CALLED THE BLACK BACCALAUREATE. AND ONE OF THE THINGS I WAS INTERESTED IN I WAS INTERESTING IN LISTENING TO MY STUDENTS WHO CAME FROM ALL AREAS ACROSS THE NATION FOR THE CELEBRATION IT'S AN EAGLE STATE. WAS THEY TALKED ABOUT SOMETIMES HOW JUST HAVING THE INFORMATION FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THEIR LIVES. BEING ABLE TO BE IN AN ETHNIC STUDIES CLASS AT THE UNIVERSITY MANY OF THEM WISH THEY'D HAD IT IN HIGH SCHOOL. BUT HAVING IT CHANGED THEIR PERSPECTIVE OF WHAT THEIR MISSION WAS IN LIFE AND HOW THEY GOT SOMEHOW ANOTHER THE CONFIDENCE AND THE COURAGE. TO BASICALLY CHALLENGE THEMSELVES IN THE FIELDS OF ENGINEERING AND SO MANY OTHER AREAS AND SO I I LOOK AT THAT AND IT WAS REALLY A WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE AS CONTINUING TO SAY. HOW IMPORTANT ETHNIC STUDIES WAS WITH THEM AT THE COLLEGE LEVEL AND THEY WISH THEY'D HAD IT EARLIER? WE PASSED A RESOLUTION IN THIS FOR WHEN I FIRST CAME HERE SOME SEVEN YEARS AGO. AND THAT RESOLUTION WAS A CELEBRATION OF ETHNIC STUDIES AND SOME OF YOU WERE HERE AT THAT TIME REMEMBER THAT MANY OF THE MEMBERS ON THE FLOOR. GOT UP AND TALKED ABOUT HOW IMPORTANT THIS INFORMATION WAS IN MOTIVATING THEM TO STAY IN COLLEGE AND TO MOVE FORWARD AND TO BECOME THE PROFESSIONALS THEY BECAME. NOT ONLY WAS IT THAT THAT THE AFRICAN AMERICANS AND HISPANIC FACULTY MEMBERS WERE HERE SAYING THIS BUT WE HAD MANY OF YOU WHO WOULD NOT MANY OF OUR WHITE COLLEAGUES TALKED ABOUT. HOW HAVING THAT INFORMATION WAS SO IMPORTANT IN SHAPING WHO THEY BECAME IN THEIR VIEW OF CALIFORNIAN THE BUTTE VIEW OF THE U. S.? SO I STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT WE FINALLY STEPPED FORWARD. AND DO THIS FIRST STEP IN TERMS OF REQUIRING ETHNIC STUDIES IN OUR HIGH SCHOOLS BECAUSE IT WILL DEFINITELY CHANGE THE PERSPECTIVE OF A HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS AND WHEN IT HAS BEEN THOROUGHLY IMPLEMENTED WE SEE THAT IT CHANGES. THE BEHAVIOR THE ACADEMIC EXCELLENCE ALL THOSE THINGS CHANGE BECAUSE IT IMPROVES THE PERSPECTIVE OF THAT STUDENT IN HOW THEY FIT IN THIS WORLD AND WHAT THEIR MISSION IS. I RESPECTFULLY ASK THE AYE BILL FOR AB THREE THIRTY ONE THANK YOU DOCTOR RUBBER MISS RAMOS YOU ARE RECOGNIZED ON THIS MATTER THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER AND COLLEAGUES I ALSO RISE IN SUPPORT OF AB.

DOCTOR WEBER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED OPEN ON THIS MATTER THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER AND MEMBERS SO THIS MORNING I RISE TO PRESENT TO YOU AB. THREE SIX NINE A BILL RELATING TO THE STRUCTURE OF SALARIES FOR THE CSU EMPLOYEES. THIS WILL BE FAMILIAR TO MANY OF YOU BECAUSE THIS BILL HAS BEEN BEFORE THIS HOUSE. SEE IF SHE WAS THE ONLY STATE AGENCY THAT DOES NOT PROVIDE SALARY STEPS TO ITS STAFF. SORRY STEPS ARE INCREASES BASED ON JOB PERFORMANCE AND LONGEVITY AND I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT. IN NINETEEN NINETY SIX THE CSU BOARD OF TRUSTEES OUTSIDE OF THE BARGAINING PROCESS UNILATERALLY ELIMINATED EXISTING EMPLOYEE SALARIES STEPS. THIS HAS RESULTED IN NEW HIRES EARNING HIGHER SALARIES THAN EXISTING EMPLOYEES WHO HAVE WORKED IN THE SAME CLASSIFICATION FOR MANY YEARS. THIS IN EQUITY HAS CREATED A NINETY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN VERSION GAP BETWEEN THE SALARIES OF NEWLY HIGH. ORDER IN THE CHAMBER PLAN LONG EMPLOYED SEE ISSUE STAFF. BUT TWO DECADES THE ISSUE HAS BEEN UNWILLING TO REINSTATE SALARY STEPS WITH THIS PARTICULAR GROUP. DESPITE THE FAILURE OF THE EXISTING SORRY STEP AND THE INABILITY OF EMPLOYEES TO EARN A FAIR AND EQUITABLE WAY. AB THREE SIXTY NINE WOULD REINSTATE THE 5% STAFF ALWAYS STEP WAS THE ISSUE SUPPORT STAFF. THE INCREASE WILL BE MADE ANNUALLY WHEN EMPLOYEES MEET THE STANDARDS WAS SATISFACTORY PERFORMANCE AS DETERMINED BY THE EMPLOYEES ADMINISTRATORS. KEEP IN MIND THIS IS A A PERFORMANCE EVALUATION AND HE'S AT A MERIT SALARY THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. AND THAT BECOMES IMPORTANT. THE CURRENT STRUCTURE DOES NOT FACILITATE THIS AND AS A AS A FORMER C. ISSUE EMPLOYEE WHO I'D MINUTES WAS AN ADMINISTRATOR WHO HANDLED WITH MY STAFF. THIS WAS A PROBABLY THE MOST DIFFICULT THING TO HAVE YEAR AFTER YEAR SORRY WHO A FACULTY WHO PERFORMED AT A HIGH LEVEL OR MET GOALS AND OBJECTIVES. NOT ABLE TO GET MERIT INCREASES FACULTY GOT MERIT INCREASES ADMINISTRATORS GET MERIT INCREASES THIS GROUP OF OF EMPLOYEES OF THE LOWEST PAID INDIVIDUALS. WE HAVE BROUGHT THIS BEFORE YOU AND YOU'VE SUPPORTED EACH YEAR WE'RE OPTIMISTIC THAT WOULD A NEW GOVERNOR THAT THIS WILL HAPPEN. THAT IT WILL FINALLY HAPPEN ONE WOULD THINK THAT AFTER PRESENTING THIS BILL YEAR AFTER YEAR AND HAVING IT EMBRACE BY THE ASSEMBLY AND THE SENATE EACH YEAR. THAT AT LEAST DID AT AND HAVING THE GOVERNOR SAY WELL THIS SHOULD BE DONE IN COLLECTIVE BARGAINING. YOU WOULD THINK THAT THEY WOULD FINALLY PUT IT IN COLLECTIVE BARGAINING BUT THEY HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO AFFECT THE INSTITUTE OF THE THE THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE AND THE TRUSTEES TO BASICALLY PUT THIS IN THERE AND HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT IT. AND GIVE THE MERIT INCREASES THESE ARE THE HARDEST WORKING PEOPLE IN OUR INSTITUTION AND THAT THE LOWEST PAID IN. BUT BY AND LARGE THE LOWEST PAID INDIVIDUALS IN THE INSTITUTION THESE ARE OUR BECAUSE DALIAN'S OUR JANITORS AND IF YOU OTHER OFFICE WORKERS SO I REALLY REALLY HOPE THIS YEAR. THAT WE WILL NOT ONLY PASSES ON THIS FLOOR BUT WE WILL MAKE IT A PRIORITY FOR THIS GOVERNOR TO AT FAIRNESS BECAUSE EVERYONE ELSE HAS THIS. HAPPENED. EVEN YOU IN THIS HOUSE GIVE YOUR STAFF OF MERIT INCREASES THE GO BEYOND THE 3% OR WHATEVER IT IS BECAUSE THEY WORK HARD AND YOU WANT THEM TO STAY WITH YOU INTO BEING GAZE INVOLVED. I'M TELLING YOU AT THE INSTITUTION THIS HAPPEN INITIALLY FOR FACULTY. AND I CAN REMEMBER HOW IT AFFECTED OUR FACULTY WE HAD PEOPLE BEING HIRED IN TO DO JOBS THAT WERE WERE MAKING MORE THAN THOSE OF US WHO HAD BEEN THERE FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME. IT IS DEMORALIZING TO HAVE SUCH IN A SYSTEM THAT EXIST AND IT REALLY IS VERY DEVASTATING TO THEM AND MOST OF THE OTHER ORGAN THAT THE OTHER GROUPS THE FACULTY AND ADMINISTRATORS. HAVE FOUGHT BECAUSE THEY HAVE MORE CLOUT AT THE INSTITUTION AND HAVE GOTTEN THIS DONE. WE MUST DO IT FOR THIS GROUP OF EMPLOYEES BECAUSE IT IS CLEAR THAT THE SYSTEM WILL NOT DO IT FOR THEM I RESPECTFULLY ASK THE AYE BOTH AB. THREE SIX NINE THANK YOU DOCTOR EVER MISTER PATTERSON YOU ARE RECOGNIZED ON THIS MATTER THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER AND MEMBERS UP I RISE IN VERY STRONG SUPPORT. OF THIS BILL AND I WANT TO TAKE THIS -- HOME TO FRESNO CALIFORNIA I WANT TO SPEAK HERE. ON BEHALF OF THE MANY EMPLOYEES AT FRESNO STATE. HAVING THE PRIVILEGE OF REPRESENTING THE CITY OF FRESNO FOR EIGHT YEARS AS ITS MAYOR. AND LIVING IN FRESNO AND ACTUALLY HAVING A RADIO STATION THERE FOR THIRTY YEARS. I GOT TO KNOW THESE PEOPLE THESE ARE THE BACKBONE OF FRESNO STATE. I KNOW THEM AND I REPRESENT THEM AND THEY ARE EXPERIENCING PRECISELY WHAT THIS BILL SEEKS TO ADDRESS. IT IS EMPLOYEES SUCH AS OUR GROUNDS KEEPERS JANITORS AND THOSE WHO PAID FRESNO STATE BULLDOGS STADIUM AND MAKE IT READY FOR PRIME TIME AT FOOTBALL GAMES. MANY OF THEM HAVE TO WORK. A SECOND JOB TO MAKE ENDS MEET. THESE ARE THE EMPLOYEES THAT KEEP CSU CAMPUSES RUNNING. BUT YET MEN THINK ABOUT THIS WHEN A NEW EMPLOYEE. GETS HIRED. THEY'RE STARTING SALARY MAY BE MUCH HIGHER THAN SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN EMPLOYED. FOR TWENTY YEARS OR MORE. SO I THANK MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO FOR BRINGING AB THREE SIX NINE FOUR WOULD ONCE AGAIN I SUPPORTED ORIGINALLY. I SUPPORTED AGAIN I'M ASKING MY COLLEAGUES BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE SUPPORT A. B.

I THANK MY COLLEAGUE FROM OF FROM FRESNO AND ALL OF YOU WHO'VE EXPRESSED AN INTEREST AND CONCERN AND A COMMITMENT TO THIS. WE MUST GET THIS DONE THIS IS ABOUT FAIRNESS AND AS I SAID I'VE LIVED WITH IT AS AN ADMINISTRATOR AND BEING FEELING VERY VERY CONFLICTED WITH NOT A WITH MY STAFF. OF NOT BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE THEM WITH THE SUPPORT THEY NEED IS THESE ARE LIKE I SAID OFTENTIMES THE LOWEST PAID INDIVIDUALS AT THE INSTITUTION. UP BECAUSE OF THE CURRENT SYSTEM THEY'RE MAKING AN AVERAGE OF SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHTY DOLLARS LESS THAN ANY NEW HIRE IN THEIR CURRENT JOB. THAT IS UNACCEPTABLE VERY UNACCEPTABLE AND SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOU I BOTH AB. THREE SIX NINE OF FOR OUR C. ISSUE STAFF AND THAT WE BASICALLY TAKE THIS TO THE GOVERNOR'S DESK AND AND AND EVEN MORE STRENGTH TO BASICALLY GET IT PASSED I RESPECTFULLY ASK THE AYE VOTE. BABY THREE SIX NINE CLERK WILL OPEN THE ROLE. ALL MEMBERS VOTED DESIRE TO THE ALL MEMBERS VOTE WHO DESIRE TO VOTE. ALL MEMBERS VOTER DESIRE TO VOTE. CLERK WILL CLOSE THE ROLE IN TALLY THE VOTE I FIFTY TWO NO ZERO THIS MEASURE PASSES. WHEN FILE ITEM SEVENTY NINE AB THREE SEVENTY EIGHT THE CLERK WILL READ ASSEMBLY BILL THREE SEVENTY EIGHT BY STANLEY MEMBER LIMóN AND OTHERS AND ACTUALLY CHILD CARE? THIS LIMON YOU ARE RECOGNIZED OPEN ON THIS MATTER. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER. AB THREE SEVENTY EIGHT SIX TO CREATE A SUSTAINABLE CAREER PATHWAY AND SUPPORTS. THOSE WHO EDUCATE AND CARE FOR OUR EARLIEST LEARNERS. CALIFORNIA'S EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION WORKFORCE IS COMPRISED PRIMARILY OF WOMEN AND PREDOMINANTLY WOMEN OF COLOR. THIS IS A WORK FORCE THAT OFTEN DOES NOT EARN A LIVABLE WAGE AND QUALIFIES FOR THE SAME SUBSIDIES THE FAMILIES THEY SERVE USE. AS THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY WORK FORCE ISSUES FOR CURRENT WORK FIRST AND THE FUTURE WORK FORCE MUST REMAIN AT THE FOREFRONT OF OUR THINKING. THE ASSEMBLY BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION ON CHILD CARE WORKED TIRELESSLY OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS TO DEVELOP A COMPREHENSIVE SET OF RECOMMENDATIONS. IN ADDRESSING THE ISSUES WITH THE CURRENT E. C. WORK FORCE. ONE OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS IT'S JUST TO SUPPORT COLLECTIVE BARGAINING RIGHTS FOR FAMILY CARE HOME PROVIDERS BOTH LICENSE AND FAMILY AND FRIEND AND NEIGHBOR. CALIFORNIA RUNS A TWENTY FOUR HOUR A DAY WORKFORCE BUT OUR CHILD CARE OPTIONS FOR WORKING FAMILIES DO NOT MEET THAT NEED. NOR DO THEY SUPPORT THOSE TO PROVIDE CHILD CARE. THIS BILL PROFESSIONAL EYES IS INCREASE STABILITY FOR FAMILY CARE PROVIDERS BY MAKING QUALITY TRAINING AVAILABLE TO ALL PROVIDERS THROUGH COLLECTIVE BARGAINING. I ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT ON A. B. SEVEN THREE SEVEN EIGHT FOR ALL WORKING FAMILIES IN NEED OF CHILD CARE AND THOSE WHO SUPPORT OUR EARLIEST LEARNERS. THANK YOU MISTER MON MISTER MCCARTY YOU ARE RECOGNIZED ON THIS MATTER. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER I RISE AS I THOUGHT IT WAS A CO AUTHOR BUT I WOULD MISS TO MISS THAT SO WE'LL FIX THAT IN IN THE SENATE SIDE. I'M IS STRONG SUPPORTER THIS AS WAS MENTIONED WE ADDRESS THIS ON OUR BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION WHICH WAS -- COACH I COACH HERE BY MYSELF AND MY COLLEAGUE FROM LOS ANGELES COUNTY. AND AS THE AUTHOR MENTION THAT TOO LONG WE'VE IGNORED PEOPLE THAT WORK IN THE SERVICE INDUSTRY DOMESTIC WORKERS TO CHILD CARE WORKERS ARE PRE K. WORKERS AND AS WE KNOW. PREDOMINATELY WOMEN RAMLI WOMEN OF COLOR AND IT'S NO WONDER WHY WE HAVEN'T STEPPED UP AND STOOD BY THESE WORKERS AND SO THIS MEASURE DOES JUST THAT. IT FOCUSES ON COLLECTIVE BARGAINING WILL SOME PEOPLE SAY THAT'S JUST ABOUT WAGES THIS IS GONNA. BREAK OUR BANK IN THE STATE BUDGET AND YES WILL HAVE A DISCUSSION DONE THAT BY THE ROAD BUT THIS IS MORE ABOUT HAVING A VOICE AT THE TABLE. THAT'S WHAT UNIONS ARE ABOUT BEING ABLE TO SIT THERE AND TALK ABOUT WORKING CONDITIONS. THE DIRECTIONS OF THE INDUSTRY CURRICULUM THE WHOLE. ISSUE OF WHAT IS PROVIDED TO OUR YOUNGEST LEARNERS. AND THEN AGAIN THE IN THE INDIVIDUALS THAT WORK IN THIS INDUSTRY ARE LITERALLY PAID FAST FOOD WAGES. NOT TO DIMINISH OUR FAST FOOD WORKERS BUT THEY QUALIFY. FOR THE SAME PROGRAMS WHERE THEY TEACH. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN THAT MEANS THAT MANY TIMES THEY CAN GO AND GET A JOB AT A FAST FOOD RESTAURANT -- COSCO AND MAKE MORE MONEY AND THAT LEAVES A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY FOR THE WORK FORCE AND THAT IMPACTS NOT ONLY THEMSELVES BUT ALSO THE KIDS IN THESE PROGRAMS. SO THIS WILL FOCUS ON INCREASING PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT WHAT'S WILL HELP THE WORK FORCE BUT ALSO MAKE SURE WE IMPROVE QUALITY AS WELL THIS IS A SOUND MEASURE. AND ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE THIS MORNING THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER MCCARTY MISTER GALLAGHER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED ON THIS MATTER. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER MEMBERS AND AND I I RISE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL AND I AND I DEFINITELY APPRECIATE WHERE MY COLLEAGUE FROM SANTA BARBARA IS COMING FROM -- BUT I THINK. THE CONCERN THAT I HAVE AS WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS A LOT THIS YEAR. IS ACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY OF CHILD CARE. AND YOU KNOW MANY IN THIS ROOM KNOW PERSONALLY -- THAT THE COST OF CHILDCARE IS IS VERY HIGH AND MY CONCERN IS THAT -- THIS IS GOING TO LEAD TO HIGHER CHILD CARE COSTS THAT ARE ALREADY VERY. OUT OF REACH FOR MANY PEOPLE IN-THE STATE. AND SO I WOULD URGE A NO VOTE ON THIS I THINK THERE ARE OTHER WAYS. OTHER THAN COLLECTIVE BARGAINING. TO HELP INSURE THAT PEOPLE ARE GETTING PAID. HIGHER WAGES ARE BETTER WAGES -- BUT THIS IS THIS IS NOT THE ONLY WAY AND I AND I AM CONCERNED AGAIN ABOUT THE COST. THE COST IS ALREADY TOO HIGH FOR CHILD CARE IN THIS STATE AND THIS IS ONLY GOING TO MAKE IT HIGHER. THANK YOU MISTER GALLAGHER SEEING AND HEARING NO FURTHER DEBATE ON THIS MATTER MISS THEM AND WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU I DO WANT TO SAY THAT. THE IMPORTANCE OF INVESTING IN pOUR WORK FORCE MEANS THAT WE HAVE A WORK FORCE AND WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THE COST THAT WE'RE INVESTING IN OUR WORK FORCE INNER CHILD CARE WORK FIRST IT ENSURES THAT PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO TAKE ON THAT JOB. WE WILL HAVE A SCARCITY. OF WORKERS FOR CHILD CARE IF WE DO NOT INVEST AND THEN IF WE DO NOT PAY. LIVABLE WAGES WITH THAT MEMBERS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. CLERK WILL OPEN THEIR OWN.

MADAM SPEAKER AND AB FIVE TWO NINE PROHIBITS THE PRACTICE OF IMPOSING ON THE SPOT MANDATORY OVERTIME OF ANY PSYCHIATRIC TECHNICIAN OR PSYCHIATRIC TECHNICIAN ASSISTANT WORKING AT A STATE HOSPITAL. CHRONIC STAFFING ISSUES AT OUR STATE HOSPITAL HOSPITALS HAS OBJECTED STAFF TO WORK MANDATORY OVERTIME. RESULTING IN BACK TO BACK EIGHT HOUR SHIFTS CREATING HEALTH HAZARDS FOR PATIENTS AND STAFF. WHEN I SERVED AS A SEMINAL COUNTY SUPERVISOR I TOWARD PATTON STATE HOSPITAL AND SEEING THE CHALLENGES THAT STAFF TAKES THEIR IN THE SAFETY ISSUES THAT THAT EXIST? I WALKED INTO AN AREA WE'RE ALL PATIENTS WERE. AND WHAT I SAW WAS A SINGLE LINE SEPARATING PATIENTS FROM EMPLOYEES. THERE WAS NO WALLER BARRIER. SO SAFETY IS SOMETHING THAT WE CONTINUE TO ADDRESS. AND I MAKE REFERENCE TO MY VISIT TO PENN STATE HOSPITAL TO HIGHLIGHT THE NEED TO PROVIDE EMPLOYEES SAFETY AT OUR STATE HOSPITALS. PUTTING A STOP TO FORCED OVERTIME ON A SACK PSYCHIATRIC TECHNICIAN NOT ONLY STRENGTH IS EMPLOYEE SAFETY BUT ALSO ENSURES PATIENTS RECEIVE PROPER CARE AND ATTENTION. THIS BILL HAS NO OPPOSITION AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER OMINOUS MISS WALDRON YOU ARE RECOGNIZED ON THIS MATTER THANK YOU I DIDN'T EXPECT TO SPEAK ON THIS BILL BUT I RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT. WE'VE SEEN THIS BILL A COUPLE OF TIMES IN DIFFERENT FORMS. THESE PSYCHIATRIC TECHNICIANS. AS AS OUR OUR OF OUR COLLEAGUE JUST DESCRIBED. THEY WERE VERY SERIOUS JOB THERE IN VERY DANGEROUS CONDITIONS IN MANY ASPECTS AND UNBEKNOWNST TO MANY. MANY OF THESE FOLKS ARE WOMEN AND THEY'RE WORKING IN THESE THESE JOBS IN THE PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITALS UNDER SOME VERY -- INTENSE OF ENVIRONMENTS SO AND AND AND THE OTHER THING WITH THE THE OVERTIME YOU KNOW THEY MAKE THEIR PLANS FOR THE DAY THEY'VE GOT CHILDCARE ISSUES THEY'VE GOT FAMILY ISSUES THEY'RE TRYING TO LEAVE AND THEN THEY'RE CALLED BACK I MEAN IT'S JUST NOT APPROPRIATE. AND IT'S THE OUT THE OTHER THING THAT'S NOT APPROPRIATE IS THAT IT'S BEEN GOING ON FOR YEARS SO I REALLY URGE AN AYE VOTE ON THIS BILL THANK YOU THANK YOU MISS WALDRON SECULAR KERR YOU ARE RECOGNIZED ON THIS MATTER. MEMBERS I STAND IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL AS WELL THE NAPA STATE HOSPITALS IN MY DISTRICT THERE ARE SIX HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT PSYCH TEXAN PLOY THERE IN ABOUT. SUPPORTING THIS BILL MEANS SUPPORTING WOMEN AND FAMILIES I URGE YOU TO JOIN ME IN SUPPORT OF AB.

ALL MEMBERS THOSE WHO DESIRE TO VOTE. ALL MEMBERS VOTED IS THERE TO VOTE. ALL MEMBERS VOTE WHO DESIRE TO VOTE. CLERK WILL CLOSE THE ROLE IN TALLY THE VOTE I SIXTY FOUR KNOWS ONE THIS MEASURE PASSES. BY LATE IN NINETY THREE AB FIVE THIRTY NINE THE CLERK WILL READ ASSEMBLY BILL FIVE THIRTY NINE BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER LIMóN AND OTHERS AND ACTUALLY TO CONSUMER LOANS. THIS LIMON YOU ARE RECOGNIZED OPEN ON THIS MATTER. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER. AB FIVE THIRTY NINE IS AN IMPORTANT CONSUMER PROTECTION BILLS THAT IS YEARS OVERDUE. HIGH COST LOANS HAVE EXPLODED IN CALIFORNIA OVER THE PAST DECADE. THESE LOANS START AT TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS AND HAVE INTEREST RATES. FROM 2100% TO MORE THAN 2100%. FAR TOO OFTEN CONSUMERS ARE UNABLE TO REPAY THESE EXPENSIVE LOANS. ONE OUT OF THREE BARS WHO OBTAINED THESE LOANS. FOR MORE THAN A HUNDRED THOUSAND CALIFORNIA FAMILIES EACH YEAR. CANNOT AFFORD THEIR LOAN PAYMENTS AND FALL INTO DEFAULT. THIS PROCESS RESULT IN DAMAGE CREDIT FOR THE CONSUMER. AND CAN ALSO LEAD TO THEIR PAYCHECK BEING GARNISHED THEIR BANK ACCOUNT CLOSED OR THEIR CAR BEING REPOSSESSED. ONE OUT OF THREE TIMES MEMBERS. I CANNOT THINK OF ANOTHER PRODUCT THAT FEELS SO OFTEN WITHOUT GOVERNMENT STEPPING IN TO INTERVENE. THE IDEA THAT CONSUMERS WILL NOT HAVE CREDIT OPTIONS IF THIS BILL PASSES IS NOT REALISTIC. THE RESPONSIBLE LENDERS WHO SUPPORT THIS BILL HAVE FOUND WAYS TO OFFER SAFE AFFORDABLE CREDIT OPTIONS TO BARS WITH DAMAGE CREDIT FOR EVEN NO CREDIT SCORE AT ALL. THESE LENDERS PROVIDE MORE THAN TWO BILLION. DOLLARS OF CREDIT ACCESS EACH YEAR TO CALIFORNIA BARS. AND LET'S BE CLEAR. ON THE ISSUE OF HIGH COST INSTALLMENT LOANS CALIFORNIA IS AN OUT LIAR. WE ARE AMONG A SMALL MINORITY OF STATES THAT DO NOT CAP INTEREST RATES ON THESE LOANS. THIRTY EIGHT STATES IN OUR COUNTRY. HAVE TAPPED [inaudible] THIS PRODUCT. I HAVE WORKED HARD TO FIND A COMPROMISE THAT COULD EARN THE SUPPORT FROM BOTH CONSUMER GROUPS AND LENDERS ALIKE. AB FIVE THREE NINE IS THE RESULT OF THOSE NEGOTIATIONS. WE ALSO HAVE A STRONG COALITION OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. LABOR ORGANIZATIONS RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS AND VETERAN GROUPS WHO SUPPORT THIS EFFORT. AFTER SO MANY YEARS OF FAILED THE TREND TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM I ASK YOU TO JOIN ME IN ADVANCING THIS IMPORTANT POLICY. THAT WILL BENEFIT BOTH CONSUMERS AND RESPONSIBLE LENDERS ALIKE. THANK YOU MISTER MON RESTAURANT MOST YOU ARE RECOGNIZED ON THIS MATTER. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND AND I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL IT REALLY DOES COME INTO THE THE CHARACTER OF OUR COMMUNITIES WHEN YOU START TO LOOK AT PREDATORY LENDING. AND YOU'RE BEING TOLD ONE INTEREST RATE THAT'S COMING UP IN THIS CASE TEN POINT 49% AND THEN ONCE YOU AVERAGE IT OUT TO THE MONTHLY DAILY RATE ON THE ANNUAL RATE OF OVER A 125%. I BELIEVE THAT'S OVER BEARING AN OVER EXHAUSTING TO THE MEMBERS IN OUR COMMUNITY SO I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL AND URGE OUR COLLEAGUES TO SUPPORT THIS. THANK YOU MISTER RAMOS MISTER CUNNINGHAM YOU ARE RECOGNIZED IN SPANISH. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. I THOUGHT LONG AND HARD ABOUT THIS BILL AND I TALKED AT LENGTH WITH. MY COLLEAGUE MY NEIGHBOR TO THE SOUTH -- THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER FROM SANTA BARBARA ABOUT THE GOALS OF THIS BILL -- AND I RISE IN SUPPORT. I'D ASK YOU TO CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING. THE DICTIONARY DEFINES USE SIRI. DOES THE LANDING A MONEY WITH AN INTEREST WITH INTEREST AT AN UNCONSCIONABLE OR EXORBITANT AMOUNT. CONSIDER THAT IF YOU BORROW TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS TODAY. THIS IS MATH BOOKS YOU BAR TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS TODAY AT 40% INTEREST. AND YOU'RE NOT UNABLE TO MAKE ANY PAYMENTS ON THAT. IN FIVE YEARS. COMPOUNDED ANNUALLY IN FIVE YEARS YOU OWE 1-300-040-0405 DOLLARS AND SIX CENTS. OVER FIVE TIMES AS MUCH AS YOU BORROWED FIVE YEARS THAT'S THE MINIMUM LOAN THIS BILL APPLIES TO AND THAT'S THE MINIMUM INTEREST RATE AND THEY'RE CHARGING OUR CONSTITUENTS. WAY MORE THAN 40% AND IT ISN'T DISCLOSED. TO THEY ARE NOT BEING TOLD IN A LOT OF THESE PRODUCTS WITH THEIR THE ACTUAL COST OF THE DEBT THAT THEY ARE CARING. MEMBERS EVERY MAJOR WORLD RELIGION HAS. COUNSEL AGAINST YOU SIR. BECAUSE IT DESTROYS COMMUNITIES AND FAMILIES. WE NEED TO STAND UP TO PROTECT THEM. ON A FREE MARKET CAPITALIST UNDERSTATED UNASHAMED OF IT. BUT SOMETIMES WE NEED TO STAND UP AND PROTECT PEOPLE THAT ARE BEING PREYED UPON. YOU HEARD HER SAY ONE THIRD OF PEOPLE TO BORROW. FROM THIS PARTICULAR PRODUCT ONE THIRD DON'T PAY IT BACK. THEY'RE PUTTING CHANGE ON THEMSELVES IN THE FORM OF DEBT. AND THEY NEED OUR HELP I ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU MISTER CUNNINGHAM MISTER GRAYSON YOU ARE RECOGNIZED ON THIS MATTER. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I RISE TODAY IS JOINT AUTHORS OF AB. FIVE THIRTY NINE AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM SANTA BARBARA NOTED AB FIVE THIRTY NINE SEEKS TO BRING MUCH NEEDED PROTECTIONS AND TO THE SMALL DOLLAR LENDING SPACE. AS WE STAND HERE TODAY THERE ARE PEOPLE IN OUR COMMUNITIES OUR NEIGHBOURS FRIENDS AND FAMILY. WHO ARE TAKING OUT LOANS THAT ARE STRUCTURED TO BE NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO PAY BACK LOANS THAT ARE DEATH TRAPS AND PERPETUATE THE CYCLE OF POVERTY? FOR ITS PART TOO LONG THOSE WHO HAVE ARGUED AGAINST COMMON SENSE REFORMS SUCH AS THIS HAVE SAID THAT PEOPLE NEED ACCESS TO A HUNDRED AND 50% 2100%. TWO HUNDRED AND 50% CREDIT BECAUSE THAT INTEREST RATE REPRESENTS THE RISK SO OF SUBPRIME LENDING HOWEVER THE DATA TELLS US THAT RISK BASED PRICING IS SIMPLY NOT HAPPENING. IF LENDERS WERE IN FACT WRITING LOANS BASED ON RISK YOU WOULD EXPECT TO SEE LOANS FROM ALL UNDER SPREAD ACROSS A RANGE OF INTEREST RATES REPRESENTING ALL SEGMENTS OF THE SOME PRIVATE SUBPRIME MARKET. INSTEAD LOANS FROM TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED TO FIVE THOUSAND ARE HEAVILY CONCENTRATED AROUND AND OVER A 100% APR AND WORST OF ALL NUMEROUS LENDERS RIGHT NO LOANS LESS THAN A 100% APR. WE ALL KNOW THE STORE FRONTS IN ADVERTISEMENTS THAT WE SEE IN OUR COMMUNITIES. IT'S NO COINCIDENCE THAT MOST HIGH COST LENDERS ARE CONCENTRATED IN ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED AREAS OVER THE YEARS BILLIONS OF DOLLARS HAVE BEEN EXTRACTED FROM COMMUNITIES. THAT CAN LEAST AFFORD IT FORTUNATELY AND HISTORICALLY FOR THE FIRST TIME THIS REFORM EFFORT IS SUPPORTED BY A BROAD COALITION OF LENDERS WHO RIGHT AND WILL CONTINUE TO WRITE RESPONSIBLE LOANS INTO THE SUBPRIME MARKET. THE LARGEST SINGLE LENDER IN THIS SPACE IS ALREADY WRITING LOANS AT LOWER RATES THAN THIS BILL PROPOSES DESPITE WHAT THE OPPOSITION WILL FORECAST WE KNOW LENDING WILL NOT DRY UP BECAUSE OF THIS BILL. AB FIVE THIRTY NINE WILL PRESERVE REAL AND FAIR ACCESS TO CREDIT WELL IN BEING SOME OF THE MOST ABUSIVE PREDATORY LOANS IN OUR STATE AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER GRAYSON MISSED KAMAGRA OF YOU ARE RECOGNIZED ON THIS MATTER. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER I TO HAVE LENGTHY CONVERSATIONS WITH THE AUTHOR MY COLLEAGUE FROM SANTA BARBARA -- BECAUSE IT'S A COMPLICATED ISSUE. YOU KNOW IT'S A LARGER ISSUE THAN WHAT'S IN THIS BILL BUT I THINK THIS BILL HAS SOME GOOD ADJUSTMENTS TO HOW WE LAND. AT THE END OF THE DAY THOUGH WE'RE TALKING ABOUT POOR PEOPLE. AND PEOPLE WHO ARE DEEMED UNDESIRABLES OR HIGH RISK AND THEY ARE PREYED UPON. BY PAYDAY LOAN OPERATORS AND THEY'RE REDLINED BY TRADITIONAL. LENDING INSTITUTIONS IN THE REALITY IS [inaudible] THAT WITH. OUT THESE ALTERNATIVE FINANCIAL SERVICE PROVIDERS THOSE FOLKS WOULD ACTUALLY HAVE NO WHERE ELSE TO GO. BECAUSE THEY ARE YOU RACED. FROM THE APPLICATION PROCESS AND FROM THE DOORS OF OUR TRADITIONAL LENDING MARKETS. BUT WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING BECAUSE IF WE DON'T WE WILL CONTINUE TO ALLOW POOR FOLKS. AND FOLKS WHO HAVE NO CREDIT OR BAD CREDIT TO BE PUT IN THIS DANGEROUS CYCLE OF EVOLVING AND INCREASING DEBTS. AND I HOPE THAT AT SOME POINT AFTER THIS BILL PASSES AND GET MOVED ON TO THE SENATE. THAT WE CAN HAVE DIFFERENT CONVERSATIONS ABOUT HOW WE INCENTIVIZE ALL KINDS OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO WORK WITH FOLKS POOR PEOPLE AND FOLKS WHO HAVE NO CREDIT OR BAD CREDIT TO HELP THEM REBUILD AND ESTABLISH THE KIND OF CREDIT THAT WE ALL HOPE TO HAVE. SO IT IS WITH THATTHAT I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD AND I'LL BE SUPPORTING IT. THINKING HAS COME UNDER DENNIS RUBIO YOU ARE RECOGNIZED ON THIS MATTER. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I RISE TO RESPECTFULLY VOICE MY CONCERNS WITH THE POTENTIAL IMPACT. OF THAT AB FIVE THIRTY NINE WILL HAVE. THE BILL CAPS INTEREST RATES ON CALIFORNIA LICENSE CONSUMERS FINANCE LOANS OVER TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS 236%. ALTHOUGH THE BILL IS DESIGNED TO HELP CALIFORNIANS WHO CAN LEAST AFFORD TO PAY HIGH INTEREST RATES I HAVE CONCERNS I KNOW I WILL IMPACT SOME OF MY CONSTITUENTS WOULD NEED THIS ACCESS TO CAPITAL. MANY POOR PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA WHO LIVE PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK DO NOT HAVE QUICK ACCESS TO CASH WHEN THE FALL SHORT. ON PAYING BILLS AT TIMES IN ORDER TO GET THROUGH THE WEEK AND WE SEE FUNDS IMMEDIATELY TO PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE THESE ESTABLISHMENTS ARE THEIR ONLY OPTION. THIS BILL DOES NOT TAKE AWAY THE NEED FOR CAPITAL AND I WORRY THAT THIS UNMET NEED WILL BE FILLED. BY ON LICENSE INTERNET OR TYPE OF LENDERS WHO WILL HAVE NO INTEREST RATE LIMITS THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER BE HONEST GONZALEZ YOU ARE RECOGNIZED ON THIS MATTER. THANK YOU I RISE AND I AM PROUD SUPPORT AS A CO AUTHOR OF THIS. AT THIS MEASURE AND I'LL SAY THIS. IT IT WASN'T AUTOMATIC THAT I SUPPORTED THIS WHEN I FIRST CAME HERE I HAD QUESTIONS AS WELL IN AND I THINK -- MY COLLEAGUE FROM LOS ANGELES TO BRINGING UP SOME OF THOSE ISSUES I LIVE IN AN EXTREMELY. ON BANKS UNDER BATES COMMUNITY IF YOU GO DOWN -- THE MAJOR STREET IN IN MY HOMETOWN MICE MY THE AREA I LIVE IN CITY HEIGHTS EVERY SINGLE BLOCK YOU SEE LENDERS OF DIFFERENT TYPES. AND YOU DON'T SEE BANKS AND YOU CERTAINLY DON'T SEE CREDIT UNIONS AND SO I UNDERSTAND ANNE ACTUALLY BELIEVED THAT THEY WERE NECESSARY FOR SOME FOLKS WHO OTHERWISE COULDN'T. HAVE OF THE ACCESS TO CAPITAL THAT THEY NEED. BUT OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS AND BEING HERE AND ACTUALLY EXPLORING THIS FURTHER YOU REALIZE THAT'S NOT EXACTLY WHAT'S HAPPENING. THERE MANY TIMES -- THAT THE CHAIR BANKING AND I TALKED ABOUT DOING THIS AND I HAVE ACTUALLY DID WHERE YOU GO INTO ONE OF THESE FOLKS I HAVE A CREDIT SCORE OF OVER. EIGHT HUNDRED BUT THEY WERE MORE THAN HAPPY TO OFFER ME A LARGE A LOAN AND A VERY LARGE RATE WITHOUT ANY TYPE OF OF BELIEVE. IF I HADN'T KNOWN BETTER THAT I DIDN'T NEED THAT TYPE OF LOAN. THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS IN A COMMUNITY LIKE MINE WHERE YOU ACTUALLY HAVE PEOPLE WHOSE CREDIT NOT ALL OF THEIR CREDIT IS TERRIBLE. SOME OF THEM HAVE NO CREDIT BECAUSE THEY BUT NOT BANKS AND WE'VE ACTUALLY CREATED PILOT PROGRAMS TO SERVE THOSE FOLKS AT THIS RATE AT A 36% RATE. IT'S POSSIBLE IT'S DOABLE. THE STORES UNFORTUNATELY ARE PREYING ON COMMUNITIES LIKE MINE WHERE THERE ISN'T. OTHER INFRASTRUCTURE AND WE DO NEED TO DO MORE I DO UNDERSTAND -- BOTH OF MY COLLEAGUES WE NEED TO DO MORE TO BRING PEOPLE INTO OUR COMMUNITIES WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO INCENTIVIZE LENDING IN OUR COMMUNITY IS NOT JUST TO INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE ARE HAVING A HARD TIME. BUT YOU FOLKS WANT TO START A SMALL BUSINESS WE REALLY NEED THIS KIND OF ACCESS TO CAPITAL. BUT WE HAVE TO STOP WHAT'S HAPPENING IT IS JUST. UNCONSCIONABLE IT'S NOT OKAY AND SO I AM PROUD TO BE PART OF THIS I KNOW -- THIS IS A TOUGH. PULL AND I DON'T THINK WE'VE EVER SEEN THIS KIND OF COALITION COMING TOGETHER BIPARTISAN. ACROSS ALL PARTS OF THE STATE TO FINALLY SAY ENOUGH IS ENOUGH SO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR NINE OUT THANK YOU MISS AND SALAS. SEEING AND HEARING NO FURTHER DEBATE MISTER SPEAKER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED TO SPEAK ON THIS MATTER. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER AND MEMBERS MEMBERS I RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF AB FIVE THIRTY NINE AND CONSIDERED TO BE AS IMPORTANT AS ANY PIECE OF LEGISLATION WE WILL VOTE ON THIS YEAR. WE HAD TRIED BEFORE IN THIS HOUSE AND IN THIS IN THIS BUILDING TO AND PREDATORY LENDING BUT WE MUST SUCCEED THIS YEAR. THIS IS NOT JUST A POLITICAL ISSUE THIS IS A MORAL ISSUE WE CAN NOT BE COMPLICIT WITH EXORBITANT INTEREST RATE LOANS. THAT VICTIMIZE WORKING PEOPLE WHO LIVE FROM PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK. OPPONENTS OF THIS BILL WILL TELL YOU THAT IT WILL IT RESTRICT ACCESS TO CREDIT FOR THE PEOPLE WHO NEED IT MOST. THOSE ARE MERELY TALKING POINTS OF AN INDUSTRY THAT HAS REPEATEDLY LIED TO MEMBERS OF THIS BODY. DOES THE TALKING POINTS OF AN UNSCRUPULOUS INDUSTRY. DON'T BE FOOLED BY THEM. THE ONLY ONES FACING RESTRICTED ACCESS ARE THOSE LENDERS THEMSELVES WHO WANT ACCESS TO VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES SO THAT THEY CAN CONTINUE TO PREY ON THEM. WE ALREADY HAVE RESPONSIBLE LENDERS WITH BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. AS A BUSINESS SERVING THE SAME SUBPRIME CONSUMERS. THOSE LENDERS LIMIT THEMSELVES TO THE INTEREST RATES IN THIS BILL. AND THOSE LENDERS ARE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. PRACTICE OF PREYING ON PEOPLE IN DESPERATE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT INCLUDES WORKING PEOPLE WITH SUDDEN HOSPITAL BILLS? BORROWING IS NORMAL. WE DO IT ALL THE TIME WITH CREDIT CARDS IN WITH HOME LOANS. BUT LOANS OFFERED AT RATES THAT COURTS HAVE ALREADY FOUND ON REASONABLE. DO NOT HELP BORROWERS AT RISK I ASK YOU TO VOTE YES ON IB AB. FIVE THIRTY NINE THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER SOMEONE YOU MAY CLOSE. I THINK WE'VE HEARD TODAY. BOTH THE STRUGGLES WE'VE HAD TO GET HERE TO GET TO THIS MOMENT. BUT I WANT TO ALSO REMIND PEOPLE THAT THIS IS CLEARLY MOVING THE NEEDLE. FOR THE FOR THE LAST FOURTEEN YEARS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. HAS TRIED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT A PRODUCT THAT HAS FAILED CALIFORNIANS. HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE YOUR DEFAULT. IN OUR STATE. TWENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE A YEAR IN OUR STATE LOSE THEIR CAR BECAUSE OF THIS PRODUCT [inaudible] THIS BILL. IS OUR ATTEMPT TO MOVE FORWARD IT'S OUR ATTEMPT TO MAINTAIN A RESPONSIBLE AND HENCE HEALTHY FINANCIAL PRODUCTS ON THE MARKET. AND STILL ALLOW ACCESS TO CAPITAL. THIS IS BEEN TESTED THIS RATE pTHIRTY EIGHT OTHER STATES HAVE TESTED IT. AS HAS OUR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WHEN THEY IMPLEMENTED THAT MILITARY LENDING ACT. WE KNOW THAT WE WILL MAINTAIN. ACCESS TO CAPITAL. FOR THOSE THAT HAVE WORRIED ABOUT BUSINESSES GOING AWAY FROM CALIFORNIA. pBY RESPONSIBLE LENDERS. A BILL THAT TELLS YOU THAT THE BUSINESSES WHO ARE DOING THE BEST THING AND OFFERING CAPITAL. WILL STAY HERE. AND THEY ARE READY TO MOVE FORWARD. YOU HAVE BUSINESSES THAT ARE TELLING YOU THAT THEY'RE LOOKING FOR REGULATORY STABILITY. BECAUSE JUST LAST YEAR. OUR CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT. UNANIMOUSLY SAID THAT THESE THIS PRODUCT WAS UNCONSCIONABLE. THEY DIDN'T KNOW THE RATE BUT THEY KNEW THERE WAS A PROBLEM. YOU ALSO HAVE. THE THREAT OF THE BALLOT INITIATIVE. LOTS OF DISCUSSIONS ABOUT WHAT THE RATE COULD BE. THE 36% HAS BEEN TESTED. IT'S BEEN A STANDARD FOR OUR ACTIVE MEMBERS OF THE MILITARY. AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT CALIFORNIA CAN DO AND SHOULD DO. THIS DOES NOT ELIMINATE OUR NEED. TO CONTINUE TO ADDRESS THE ROOT CAUSE OF THIS WHICH IS POVERTY. FINANCIAL PRODUCTS SHOULD NOT BE A SUBSTITUTE FOR CORE ISSUES LIKE POVERTY AND THAT'S WHAT THIS PRODUCT HAS BECOME. MEMBERS I ASK THAT YOU CONSIDER VOTING IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL BECAUSE CALIFORNIANS NEED US TO PROTECT THEM CALIFORNIANS NEED US TO DO THE RIGHT THING. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE.

AB SIX ONE SIX ONE IS OUR IS MY SKIP THE SLIP BILL. OF THIS GET THE FOOT BILL REQUIRES ON JANUARY TWENTY FIVE JANUARY. ONE TWENTY TWENTY THAT BUSINESSES PROVIDE PAPER RECEIPTS UPON REQUEST. ALSO IN CHEN BY JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY FOUR IT ALLOWS CUSTOMERS TO CHOOSE BETWEEN THREE OPTIONS ASKING ASKING FOR IT NO RECEIPT. IN E. RECEIPT OR A PAPER RECEIPT. IN ADDITION WE ADDED SIGNIFICANTLY MORE EXEMPTIONS TO ASSIST SMALL BUSINESSES SO THAT SMALL BUSINESSES THAT GROSS UNDER TWO MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR WILL BE EXEMPT FROM OUR LEGISLATION. IN ADDITION WE ALSO ADDED AMENDMENTS IN APPROPRIATIONS THAT. BUSINESSES THAT USE BPA SLASH B. P. S. FREE PAPER. AND ALSO DO NOT INCLUDE NONESSENTIAL INFORMATION MEETING INFORMATION THAT'S NOT PERTINENT TO THE RECEIPT. IT WOULD ALSO BE EXEMPT ALSO HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS ARE ALSO EXEMPT -- THE REASON WE'RE DOING THE BILL IS WE HAVE A PROBLEM THAT EVERY SINGLE PIECE ALMOST EVERY SINGLE PIECE OF RECEIPT THAT WE HAVE IS ACTUALLY LACED WITH BPA OR BE PS WHICH MEANT MANY OF US KNOW IS A VERY TOXIC CHEMICAL. IN FACT WE WENT TO THE EXTRAORDINARY LIMIT TO ACTUALLY MAKE SURE THAT BABY BOTTLES. AND BOTTLES THAT WE DRINK WATER OUT OF DON'T HAVE B. P. IT. YET EVERY DAY WE ARE EXPOSING OURSELVES TO THIS KIND OF CHEMICAL BY TOUCHING THE RECEIPTS THAT WE'RE GETTING WE'RE JUST BUYING EVERYDAY PRODUCTS. IN ADDITION TO MAKE THESE RECEIPTS NATIONALLY WE ARE USING APPROXIMATELY THREE MILLION TREES AND NINE BILLION. GALLONS OF WATER. WE'RE AT A STAGE NOW WITH THESE RECEIPTS ARE DIFFICULT TO RECYCLE BECAUSE THEY ARE VERY SMALL AND IT'S HARD FOR MANY OF THE MACHINES TO CATCH. ALSO IN ADDITION THEY DON'T COMPOST SO WITH SAN FRANCISCO WHERE WE HAVE COMPOST I WAS ACTUALLY SHOCKED TO LEARN BECAUSE OF THIS CHEMICAL WHEN I WAS PUTTING IT INTO MY COMPOST BIN. IT ACTUALLY WAS POLLUTING OUR COMPOST SO AGAIN BY JUST MAKING THERE'S MUCH MORE OF A ASK FOR THE PAPER RECEIPT RATHER THAN MAKE SURE THAT EVERYBODY GETS THAT. WE THINK WE CAN SAVE A LOT OF PAPER REDUCE A LOT OF WAYS AND ALSO HELP STOP EXPOSURE TO SOME VERY DANGEROUS CHEMICALS WITHOUT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE ON AB.

SOME PEOPLE SEVEN NINETY TWO BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER TAKEN OUT RELATE TO RECYCLING. MR TING YOU ARE RECOGNIZED OPEN ON THIS MATTER. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER AB SEVEN NINETY TWO ESTABLISHES. A TIME FRAME TO HAVE A MINIMUM RECYCLING CONTENT. IN OUR PLASTIC BEVERAGE BOTTLES UNFORTUNATELY ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF AGO MUCH OF THE RECYCLING THAT WE WERE PUTTING INTO OUR BLUE BINS WHICH WAS BEING SHIPPED OVERSEAS TO CHINA. CHANGED BECAUSE CHINA STOP TAKING MUCH OF THAT WASTE. SO UNFORTUNATELY WHAT MANY PEOPLE ACTUALLY HAVEN'T EVEN REALIZE IS MUCH OF THAT RECYCLING THAT WE THOUGHT WAS ACTUALLY GETTING RECYCLED. IS GOING EITHER TO LANDFILL GOING INTO THE OCEAN BEING INCINERATED. THE ONE THING IT'S NOT BEING IS RECYCLED. AND SO WHAT WE'VE WANTED TO DO WAS TO TRY TO CREATE GUIDELINES AND GOALS WHERE WE ACTUALLY HAVE A MINIMUM AMOUNT OF RECYCLING. IN EVERY -- BEVERAGE BOTTLE IN CALIFORNIA. MANY COMPANIES HAVE ALREADY DONE THIS IF YOU IF YOU GET A NAKED JUICE BOTTLE THEY ALREADY ADVERTISED THEIR THAT THEIR BOTTLES 1100% RECYCLED. IF YOU TALK TO THE WATER COMPANIES OF NESTLE IN NIAGARA THEY'RE ALMOST AT 30% RECYCLED CONTENT SO THIS CAN BE DONE. EUROPE IN FACT THE EUROPEAN UNION ALREADY JUST ESTABLISHED. GUIDELINES INCLUDING GOALS WERE THE EUROPEAN UNION HAS PLEDGED TO DO 25% BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE AND 30% BY. TWENTY THIRTY SO OUR BILL ESTABLISHES THE FOLLOWING GUIDELINES WE WANT TO HAVE. 25% BY 202150% BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE IN 75%. BY. TWENTY THIRTY AND WE BELIEVE BY SETTING THE GOAL GETTING THESE GUIDELINES THEN THE PLASTIC BOTTLES THAT WE HOPE TO ACTUALLY GET RECYCLED WILL ACTUALLY BE RECYCLED. NOT SOMEWHERE ELSE INCH LIKE CHINA OR SOME OTHER OVERSEAS MARKETS. RIGHT HERE IN CALIFORNIA WELL WE ACTUALLY HAVE FACTORIES WAITING AND WANTING TO TAKE THIS PRODUCT RECYCLING. IN SELL IT BACK IN SO WE THINK THIS WILL HELP CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES THIS WILL MAKE SURE THAT THE BOTTLES THAT WE ARE THINKING ARE GETTING RECYCLE ACTUALLY BE RECYCLED. AND WE THINK THIS WILL MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT JUST ONE SCARY NO. IF WE DON'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT OUR PLASTICS AND I KNOW WE HAVE OTHER -- PLASTICS BILLS COMING UP BUT IN THE NEXT COUPLE DAYS IF WE DON'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH PLASTICS WE WILL HAVE MORE PLASTIC IN THE OCEAN.

BAD AIR QUALITY. SO WE'RE INCENTIVIZING NOW THE PURCHASE OF HOMES IN AREAS IDENTIFIED WITH BETTER QUALITY. THE REVERSE WOULD BE PROBABLY MUCH MUCH BETTER THAT IF WE GAVE THEM THIS CREDIT FOR MOVING OUT OF THE CALAVERAS SCREEN AREA THAT'S THE KIND OF A PROGRAM THAT I THINK WE SHOULD BE. PROVIDING AN INCENTIVE. FOR THE VIRUS CAN PROGRAM WAS NOT REALLY DESIGNED FOR A PROGRAM LIKE THIS AND BECAUSE OF THAT BECAUSE IT'S A THOSE ARE IDENTIFIED AREAS WITH POOR AIR QUALITY.

SEVEN THROUGH TWELVE TO INCLUDE A POLICY ON THE YOUTH SUICIDE PREVENTION FOR GRADES ONE THROUGH. SIX THE LEGISLATURE HAS WORKED HARD TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT STRIDES ON KEEPING KIDS SAFE FROM BULLYING AND HARASSMENT IN AND OUT OF THE CLASSROOM. BULLYING CAN LEAD TO DEPRESSION IN SOME CASES SELF HARM BY SUICIDE. IN MY DISTRICT. WE SEE IN A SERIES OF SIR -- SUICIDES TAKE PLACE AS EARLY AS A PERSON IN THE SIXTH GRADE. SUICIDES IN ALL PARTS OF OUR SOCIETY AND ALL AGE RANGES IS AN EPIDEMIC AND WHILE THE ISSUE OF ADOLESCENT SUICIDE. HAS RECEIVED FOCUS IN RESOURCES IN RECENT YEARS RATES OF YOUTH SELF HARM AND SUICIDE HAVE TRAGICALLY INCREASED. WHILE OTHER RESOURCES -- SCHOOL DISTRICTS PROVIDE ARE EXPENSIVE TO MOST AGE RANGES SUICIDE PREVENTION POLICIES ARE GREAT EXCLUSIVE. ONLY TARGETING THAT GRADES SEVEN THROUGH TWELVE THESE GREAT EXCLUSIVE POLICIES CAN TRAGICALLY LEAVE BEHIND STUDENTS WHO ARE ALSO AT RISK IN A YOUNG AGE.

CLOSER ROLE TALLY THE VOTE I SIXTY THREE NO ZERO THAT MEASURE PASSES. THERE WAS WITHOUT OBJECTION ALL MORNING MOVE BACK IN THE FILE THE FILE ITEM. TWO TWENTY EIGHT WE'RE GOING TO TAKE UP FILE I'M. TO TWENTY EIGHT AB SEVENTEEN THIRTY ONE CLICK WITH. SOME LEGAL SEVENTEEN THIRTY ONE BY SOME REMEMBER FOR HORROR MATHEMATICALLY THE BUSINESS. IS BOERNER HORVATH YES THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND COLLEAGUES WE ALL KNOW TOO WELL THAT WE'RE IN THE MIDST OF A HOUSING CRISIS. WE TALK ALL THE TIME ABOUT INCREASING SUPPLY BUT WE SPEND VERY LITTLE TIME ADDRESSING THE REMOVAL SUPPLY FROM THE HOUSING MARKET. WHERE THIS HAPPENS MOST OFTEN AS WELL WHEN HOMES INTENDED FOR FAMILIES AND SENIORS AND VETERANS AND WORKING FAMILIES? ARE REMOVED OFTEN PERMANENTLY FROM THE HOUSING STOCK FOR FULL TIME SHORT TERM VACATION RENTALS. ALL CITIES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA CAN REGULATE. OR BAN SHORT TERM VACATION RENTALS AS THEY SEE FIT. THIS IS NOT TRUE BECAUSE OF THEM. THE COASTAL COMMISSION REQUIRES OUR CITIES TO HAVE SHORT TERM VACATION RENTALS BECAUSE THEY HAVE ONLY PURVIEW OVER ACCESS TO THE COAST. WITH NO AUTHORITY TO BOUNCE THAT WITH IMPACT OF REMOVAL OF HOUSING FROM THE HOUSING STOCK IN THE CITY'S. SAN DIEGO COUNTY IS ONE OF THE BEST RATIOS FOR LOWER COST COASTAL COMBINATIONS PER CAPITA IN THE STATE. BUT ON TOP OF THAT WE HAVE APPROXIMATELY ELEVEN THOUSAND SHORT TERM VACATION RENTALS MOST OF WHICH ARE FULL TIME. WHEN WE'RE ADEQUATE PROVIDING ACCESS TO THE COAST WHY WOULD WE EVER CREATE A SYSTEM THAT ALLOWS FOR THE FIGURES HAVE DEMOLITION OF HOUSING FROM HOUSING STOCK? AB SEVENTEEN THIRTY ONE SIX ADDRESS THIS ISSUE IN A VERY NUANCED WAY. BRANDISHING A PILOT PROGRAM FOR FIVE YEARS AND SAN DIEGO COUNTIES COASTAL ZONE. REGULATING SHORT TERM VACATION RENTAL PLATFORMS. I WANT TO BE CLEAR ABOUT WHAT AB SEVENTEEN THIRTY ONE DOES AND DOES NOT DO. AB SEVENTEEN THIRTY ONE SAYS WHEN THE PRIMARY RESIDENT IS NOT ON SITE THE SHORT TERM VACATION RENTAL PLATFORM MAY BOOK A UNIT IN THE SAN DIEGO COUNTY COASTAL ZONE. FOR UP TO THIRTY DAYS THAT MEANS OF A PROPERTY OWNER OWNS OWNER PLATFORM HOPS THEY MAY USE PLATFORMS FOR UP TO NINETY DAYS. BASED ON THE CHROME CURRENT NUMBER PLATFORMS THE MARKET -- THIS THAT'S AN ENTIRE STE HER SUMMER FOR US IN VIDEO COUNTY OR ALMOST EVERY WEEKEND OF THE ENTIRE YEAR. AB SEVENTEEN THIRTY ONE ALSO IMPORTANTLY REQUIRES THAT SHORT TERM VACATION WITH THE PLATFORMS. COLLECTED RETURN TRANSIT OCCUPANCY TAX TO THE LOCAL CITIES WHICH IS KEY FOR CITIES TO PAY FOR VISITORS SERVING SERVICES -- BUT TOURISTS USE AS WELL AS GIVING NECESSARY TRANSPARENCY FOR ENSURING WHERE SHORT TERM VACATION RENTALS ARE OPERATING THEY ARE SAFE AND RESPONSIBLE. AB SEVENTEEN THIRTY ONE I WANNA BE CLEAR ABOUT WHAT IT DOESN'T DOESN'T DO AB SEVENTEEN THIRTY ONE DOES PRESERVE LOCAL CONTROL BY REGULATING THE PLATFORMS AND NOT THE CITIES. AS WELL AS IMPORTANTLY GIVING THEM A TOOL TO ZONE AREAS RESIDENTIAL TOURISM WHERE THEY INTEND FOR SHORT TERM VACATION RENTALS. TO BE EXCLUDED FROM-ABOUT. PRESERVES COASTAL ACCESS THROUGH RUNNING PILOT PROGRAM IN THE COUNTY THAT IS THE MOST LOW COST COAST ACCOMMODATIONS IN THE STATE. AS WELL AS THE BASS PER CAPITA RATIO. ALSO THOSE PRIMARY RESIDENCE OR ONSITE REMAIN UNREGULATED BY THIS BILL AS WELL AS UP TO NINETY DAYS ON EXISTING PUT THE PLATFORMS. THAT IS A LOT OF COASTAL ACCESS THAT IS NOT REMOVING HOUSING FROM OUR HOUSING STOCK AND RESTORING ACCOMMODATIONS FOR FAMILIES TEACHERS FIREFIGHTERS ARE WORKING FAMILIES. PRISONERS PROPERTY RIGHTS BY NOT REGULATING PROPERTY OWNERS EVERYTHING HOMEOWNERS DID BEFORE SHORT TERM VACATION RENTAL PLATFORMS. THEY CAN STILL DO FOR THE LOCAL ORDINANCES THEY CAN READ TO FAMILY OR FRIENDS THEY CAN PUT UP A WEBSITE THEY COULD PUT A SIGN IN FRONT OF THEIR HOUSE. IT JUST CAPS THE UNINTENDED IMPACT -- SHORT TERM VACATION RENTAL PLATFORMS TO FURTHER DISTORT OUR HOUSING MARKET. AB SEVENTEEN THIRTY ONE DOES NOT DO MANY THINGS IT DOES NOT BAN SHORT TERM VACATION RENTALS IT DOES NOT APPLY TO AREAS OUTSIDE OF SAN DIEGO COUNTY'S COASTAL THOUGH. IT DOES NOT BAN ACCESS TO THE COAST OR PREVENT YOUR CONSTITUENTS FROM VISITING SAN DIEGO WE WOULD LOVE TO HAVE YOU.

DOCTOR EGGMAN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS I AM PRESENTING TODAY AB THREE SIXTY TWO WHICH WILL BE NEW FOR ANY OF US -- THIS BILL WILL ALLOW SAN FRANCISCO TO OVERDOSE TO PILOT AN OVERDOSE PREVENTION PROGRAM. AS WE KNOW THERE IS AN OPIOID EPIDEMIC. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY. AND WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE TRIED AND TRUE METHODS OF INTERVENTION AND EARLY TREATMENT PREVENTION TO BE ABLE TO TREAT THIS -- IN THE IN THE IN NORTH AMERICA WE HAVE BEEN HESITANT TO DO THIS -- WE CONTINUE TO SEE OVERDOSE AND DEATH WE CONTINUE TO SEE THE INCREASE OF HEPATITIS C. OF HIV OF PEOPLE BEING OVERDOSING IN ALLEYS WE CONTINUE TO SEE PEOPLE IN OUR EMERGENCY SYSTEM POLICE RESPONDING. EMERGENCY ROOMS OVERWHELMED. SO WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS LET'S GET PEOPLE TREATMENT EARLIER THAN LATER. WE ARE IN NO WAY CONDONING DRUG ABUSE BUT WHAT WE ARE SAYING. IS HAVING A DRUG ADDICTION SHOULD NOT BE A DEATH SENTENCE. WE KNOW THAT THE BEST WAY TO GET PEOPLE INTO TREATMENT IS TO BEGIN HAVING A RELATIONSHIP WITH THEM VERY EARLY ON WE KNOW THAT PEOPLE WHO USE. WHO ARE HOMELESS AND ARE USING ON OUR STREETS IN OUR SCHOOL GROUNDS IN OUR CHURCH YARDS ARE LEAVING NEEDLES THAT ARE DANGEROUS FOR CHILDREN? DANGERS FOR OTHER ANIMALS AND NOT GOOD FOR ANYBODY INVOLVED WE KNOW THAT THERE IS A WAY TO BE ABLE TO PILOT THIS SAN FRANCISCO IS WILLING TO PILOT IT. IT HAS A VERY SHORT SUNSET ON IT THEY WILL COME BACK WITH A REPORT ABOUT ABOUT THE IMPLEMENTATION THE BILL REQUIRES THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT BE AT THE TABLE IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH WHERE THESE ARE GOING TO BE. THERE IS A EVERY. OVER TO EVERY DRUG ADDICTION -- A SPECIALTY IS IN SUPPORT OF THIS THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION IS NOW IN SUPPORT OF IT ALSO. AGAIN THAT WE HAVE TIME TESTED IN TRUE INTERVENTIONS THIS GETS PEOPLE INTO TREATMENT THIS TELLS PEOPLE THEY DON'T HAVE TO BE DESTINED TO DIE ON THE STREETS. THIS TELLS PEOPLE THAT WE KNOW WE HAVE MORE IMPORTANT THINGS TO DO WITH OUR PUBLIC SAFETY PEOPLE THAN GOING OUT TO OVERDOSE ON THE STREETS WE KNOW THIS ALSO MEANS THAT PEOPLE DON'T HAVE TO SIT IN E. OURS TAKING UP SPACE JAILS TAKING UP SPACE. BUT THAT WE CAN TREAT THEM. WHERE THEY WHERE THEY LIVE WE CAN TREAT THEM WHERE THEY ARE IN THE MOMENT AND BE ABLE TO INVITE THEM MAYBE TO GET AN ABSCESS FIXED MAYBE TO BE ABLE TO GET? A REPRIEVE FROM DOMESTIC VIOLENCE WE KNOW IN THESE OVERDOSE PREVENTION CENTERS NOBODY HAS EVER DIED OF AN OVERDOSE ALL WE'RE SAYING IS GIVE SAN FRANCISCO A CHANCE TO GIVE PEOPLE A SHOT AT TREATMENT AND AT LIFE. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU DOCTOR I WENT MS MELENDEZ [inaudible] YOUR RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER -- LADIES AND GENTLEMEN THIS. I I APPRECIATE -- THE AUTHOR'S INTENT -- IN AND I THINK I AGREE THAT. WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING. TO KEEP PEOPLE FROM NOT ONLY DOING THESE DRUGS BUT OVERDOSING ON THEM BUT I DON'T THINK THAT GIVING THEM -- ACCENTUATE GOVERNMENT SANCTIONED FACILITY IN WHICH TO DO THEIR DRUGS IS THE BEST WAY TO GET THEM OFF THE DRUGS NOW WE'RE IN THE BILL DOES IT REQUIRE THAT ANY TREATMENT -- MUST BE ATTAINED OR THAT THEY'RE EVEN. NECESSARILY DIRECTED TO IT IT'S IT'S NOT EVEN IN THE BILL AND I THINK. BY MAKING A FACILITY LIKE THIS -- WE ARE ESSENTIALLY SPEEDING UP THEIR DEATH BECAUSE WHEN WE KNOW THE PEOPLE WHO DO THESE TYPES OF DRUGS DON'T HAVE A VERY LONG LIFESPAN IF THEY CONTINUE TO DO THESE DRUGS THEN. EVENTUALLY DEATH COMES TO THEM MUCH QUICKER THAN IT NORMALLY WOULD AND I JUST I DON'T THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE THAT WE ARE SPEEDING UP. THE DEATH PROCESS FOR THEM I DON'T DISAGREE THAT. WE HAVE TO FIND WAYS TO HELP THEM BUT I DON'T THINK THAT THIS IS THE ANSWER SO RESPECTFULLY I WOULD ASK FOR KNOW ABOUT DOCTOR CHOI. YOUR RECORD THANK YOU SPEAKER AND COLLEAGUES I OR SO -- POLLS SO AB SIX OF THREE SIXTY TWO OUT WE HAVE A NATIONAL ON YOUR DOOR AND A DROGA EPIDEMIC IN THE COUNTRY. THAT IS SO AFFECTING OUR COMMUNITY IS AND FAMILY OF WHILE I UNDERSTAND MY COLLEAGUE SO DESIRE TO PROVIDE A SAFE MEANS OF FOR INDIVIDUALS. TO A SATISFIED THEY ARE HAPPY AND THE HOPEFULLY REDUCE THE SPREAD OF THE DISEASE IS I DO NOT THINK. THAT THE THE PROLES SALT WATER -- OUTWEIGH THE CONS. WE HAVE A WE ARE TALKING ABOUT ESTABLISHING ILLEGAL DRUG USE. WE CANNOT AND SHOULD NOT HOW PEOPLE OR UP A BREAK A ADDICTION BY PROMOTING WASTE TO MAINTAIN -- THE ADDICTION. IF WE ARE TO TRULY HELP THE WHOLE SO ARE USING ILLEGAL DRUGS SO. AS I TRULY BELIEVE ON MY COLLEAGUES -- OR TRYING TO DO -- HERE. OUR OUR LOG TEND NOT TO INCLUDE THE ENABLING THESE INDIVIDUALS SO. IN CONTINUING DALE ADDICTION. FOR THESE REASONS I ASK YOUR NOVEL THANK YOU. THANK YOU DOCTOR CHOI MISS RUBIO YOUR RECOGNIZE. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I AM ARE RISING TODAY IN SUPPORT OF OF THE PREVENTION CENTERS BECAUSE I KNOW THAT WE ALL KNOW THAT THERE ARE A WHOLE PEELED OVER [inaudible] CRISIS IS. TOUCHING EVERY SINGLE COMMUNITY THIS IS SPECIFIC TO SAN FRANCISCO COUNTY IN SAN FRANCISCO THE MAYOR OF SAN FRANCISCO WAS HERE LAST YEAR. AND SHE EXPRESSED HER WILLINGNESS TO TRY THIS OUT IF THIS PROGRAM DOES NOT WORK THEN IT WILL NOT BE EXPANDED TO ANY OTHER COMMUNITIES. IF IT DOES WORK THAT WE HAVE A MODEL TO HELP ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES. ACROSS THE STATE TO HELP THESE FOLKS WE'RE NOT PROVIDING. THE BILL DOES NOT PROVIDE THE DRUGS FOR THOSE FOLKS THEY ALREADY HAVE THE DRUGS ARE PROVIDING SAFE. INJECTION OF FACILITIES WE CANNOT JUST SIT BACK AND DO NOTHING I GREW UP IN DOWNTOWN LA MOST OF MY FRIENDS A LOT OF MY FRIENDS -- WERE EITHER IN GAINES OR ADDICTED TO DRUGS AND UNFORTUNATELY A LOT OF THOSE ARE GONE. IF WE DO NOT LOOK FOR WAYS TO SOLVE THIS ISSUE WE'RE GOING TO BE IN THE SAME PLACE THAT WE ARE TODAY THIS IS THE OPPORTUNITY TO TRY THIS OUT THE MAYOR OF SAN FRANCISCO IS WILLING -- TO TRIED IN HER COMMUNITY AND IF IT WORKS WE CAN EXPAND THE PROGRAM I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THIS IS A CRISIS THAT NEEDS TO BE -- HANDLE THAN WE CAN HANDLE IT IF FOR JUST SITTING BACK PRETENDING THAT IT DOESN'T EXIST I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THERE WAS ROOM IS FRIEDMAN YOUR RECOGNIZE THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I STAND TODAY AS A CO AUTHOR OF AB. THREE SIXTY TWO AND MY ONLY ISSUE WITH THE BILL RIGHT NOW IS THAT IT'S LIMITED TO SAN FRANCISCO -- AND I WOULD POINT OUT TO MY COLLEAGUES WHO SAY THAT THEY BELIEVE THAT THIS ISN'T THE WAY TO ADDRESS THE DRUG EPIDEMIC. I WOULD ASK WELL THEN WHAT IS THE WAY. BECAUSE WHAT WE'RE DOING RIGHT NOW IS CLEARLY NOT WORKING AND DEFENDING THE STATUS QUO. AND DOING NEXT TO NOTHING WHEN WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE OTHER SOLUTIONS OUT THERE THAT CITIES ARE WILLING TO TRY. IS SIMPLY NOT ACCEPTABLE IN THE FACE OF THE DRUG EPIDEMIC. AND IN CASE ANYBODY THINGS THAT THIS IS SOME KIND OF CRAZY SHOT IN THE DARK OF A SOLUTION. LET ME REMIND EVERYBODY THAT CANADA HAS EMPLOYED THIS VERY SAME SOLUTION FOR YEARS AND IS SEEN IN THE AREAS AROUND. THE SAFE INJECTION SITES A DROP IN CRIME. A DROP IN DEATHS. A DROP IN DISEASE. AND MANY OTHER POSITIVE RESULTS. NOW IN LOS ANGELES AND IN MANY OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE WHERE WE HAVE -- DRUGS WE'VE ALSO SEEN OUTBREAKS OF HEPATITIS AND OTHER COMMUNICABLE DISEASES. HAVING PEOPLE IN FACILITIES WITH TRAINED MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS WHICH IS WHAT THESE FACILITIES OFFER. IS A WAY TO RECOGNIZE AND TREAT DISEASE BEFORE THEY BECOME AN EPIDEMIC IN OUR ENTIRE COMMUNITY. SO IF NOT FOR THE ADDICTS THEMSELVES. AND IT SHOULD BE FOR THE ADDICTS THEMSELVES BUT IF THAT'S NOT IF THEY'RE LIVES DON'T MEAN ENOUGH FOR YOU. TO TAKE THIS MEASURE THEN THINK ABOUT THE REST OF THE COMMUNITY AND WHAT THEY'RE BEARING WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE LIVING ON THE STREETS AND WITHOUT MEDICAL CARE THIS IS A WAY TO GET PEOPLE INTO MEDICAL TREATMENT THAT'S PROVEN AND THAT WORKS. AND WITH THAT I WOULD WOULD ASK YOU TO LOOK DEEP INTO YOUR HEART AND VOTE I ON THIS MEASURE TODAY THANK YOU. MISTER DAVID CHIU YOUR RECOGNIZE THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER COLLEAGUES APPRECIATE YOUR CONSIDERATION OF A PILOT OF THE OVERDOSE PREVENTION PROGRAM. AND LET ME THANK OUR COLLEAGUE FROM STOCKTON FOR HER. LONG ADVOCACY ON THIS ISSUE -- AND AS WE JUST HEARD FROM ONE OF OUR COLLEAGUES -- UNFORTUNATELY AT THIS TIME THROUGH THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS -- WE HAVE DECIDED TO JUST NARAL THIS TO OUR CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO AND I'M VERY APPRECIATIVE AS A REPRESENTATIVE OF SAN FRANCISCO. OUGHT TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THIS DIALOGUE. BUT I DO HOPE THAT WE ARE ABLE TO TEST IF IT WORKS AND IT IS THAT NARROW -- THIS IS AN IDEA THAT I THINK MANY OF US WHEN WE FIRST HEAR ABOUT IT IT TAKES A LITTLE TIME. TO UNDERSTAND IT AND TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE DATA IS BUT IF YOU LOOK AROUND THE WORLD THAT STUDIES. ARE AROUND THE GLOBE WE HAVE SEEN THIS WORK AND THIS IS WHY PUBLIC HEALTH PROFESSIONALS SUPPORTED IF YOU LOOK AT IT FROM A FISCAL STANDPOINT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT COULD SAVE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. BECAUSE IT ALREADY HAS IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS IF YOU LOOK AT IT FROM A PUBLIC SAFETY STANDPOINT THE REASON LAW ENFORCEMENT SUPPORTS THIS IS A NOTE THIS IS A DIFFERENT SOLUTION. THAT ACTUALLY WORKS BUT IN SHORT THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE DYING ON THE STREETS. IN OUR COMMUNITIES UP AND DOWN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR THIS BILL IS TO ALLOW FOR ONE PILOT. IN A CITY THAT IS SEVEN BY SEVEN SQUARE MILES TO SEE IF THIS WILL WORK AND IF IT DOES WE CAN HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT EXPANDING IT AROUND THE STATE. AT THE END OF THE DAY WE HAVE A DUTY TO MAKE SURE WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN TO SAVE THE LIVES OF OUR CONSTITUENTS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MISTER MESS YOU ARE RECOGNIZED HIM AS SPEAKER MEMBERS -- WHEN THIS BILL WAS BROUGHT BEFORE THE HEALTH COMMITTEE AND I FIRST SAW THAT MY FIRST GUT INSTINCT WAS THAT I WAS? GOING TO VOTE NO ON THIS MEASURE JUST LIKE SOME OF YOU IF YOU I'M HAD READ THIS YOU'D THINK OH I CAN'T SUPPORT THIS. GIVE ME POLITICALLY DIFFICULT FOR ME TO BE ABLE TO DO SO. BUT WE KNOW THAT DRUG ADDICTION IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM IT IS IN MY DISTRICT AND I'LL TELL YOU THAT I CARE AS MUCH ABOUT. THE ADDICTS IN MY DISTRICT AS I DO ABOUT THE ADDICTS IN THE CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO AND THE TRUTH IS. WHAT WE'RE DOING IS NOT WORKING THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM IS FAILING THESE PEOPLE THERE'S THIS MIGHT NOT BE? THE OVERALL ANSWER BUT FOR GOODNESS SAKE LET'S TRY SOMETHING ELSE I KNOW THAT MY COLLEAGUE THE AUTHOR -- THE MEMBER FROM A FROM STOCKTON IS PUT A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF WORK IN AND DO THIS I KNOW THAT THEIR SUPPORT LOCALLY. WITH THE CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO THAT THEY WILL BE A SUPERVISING -- THIS -- THIS THIS THESE PROGRAMS AND FOR THAT REASON I'LL BE SUPPORTING THIS MEASURE AGAIN TODAY. THANK YOU MISS MAYES SEE NO ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THE ITEM. DOCTOR EGGMAN YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS AND THANK YOU ALL FOR THE CONVERSATION I THINK. WE'VE EVOLVED OVER THE COURSE OF THE YEARS THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS WELL WE DON'T TALK ABOUT IT WITH THE SAME LEVEL OF THE TREE ALL. TOWARDS THE PEOPLE WHO ARE ADDICTS ARE THE PEOPLE WHO WANT TO TRY TO DO SOMETHING TO HELP. THIS IS AN ISSUE OF TREATMENT. THIS IS AN ISSUE OF REDEMPTION AND HOPE. THIS IS AN ISSUE ABOUT HOW DO WE TREAT THE LEAST OF US THAT IS THE TRUE CALLING I THINK THAT WE'RE ALL ALL OF US WHO FOR THE LEAST OF US HOW CAN WE EXTEND. THE THE GOOD CHRISTIAN LOVE ALL SAY LIKE THAT HOW DO WE EXTEND THAT. AND THAT THAT THAT LOVE THAT HOPE THAT RESPECT. TO EVERY SINGLE PERSON. THIS IS NOT A PERFECT BILL. THIS HAS.
