MEMBER BERMAN OR BONTA OR ASSEMBLY WOMAN IRWIN OR STRIKE THAT -- ASSEMBLYMEMBER LOW. WE WOULD WELCOME YOUR ATTENDANCE YEAH SO -- THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER BONTA -- AB. EIGHT FORTY NINE AND WE HAVE A SUBCOMMITTEE SO. WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU COLLEAGUES AND STAFF FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT AB EIGHT FORTY NINE TODAY. REDISTRICTING IS OF CRUCIAL IMPORTANCE TO LOCAL DEMOCRACY HOW CITY OR COUNTY ELECTION. DISTRICTS ARE DRAWN CAN HELP DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT I COMMUNITY WILL BE FAIRLY REPRESENTED BY THE MOST INTIMATE AND PROXIMATE GOVERNMENT. BODIES UNLIKE STATE LEVEL REDISTRICTING THERE ARE VERY FEW REQUIREMENTS GOVERNING CITY AND COUNTY REDISTRICTING TO ENSURE THE PROCESS IS FAIR. AND TRANSPARENT. AND THAT THE PUBLIC AND ESPECIALLY UNDER REPRESENTED COMMUNITIES ARE ENGAGED IN THE PROCESS. AB EIGHT FORTY NINE WILL BRING TRANSPARENCY. AND CREATE CLEAR STANDARDS FOR CITIES AND COUNTIES BY EXPANDING OPPORTUNITIES FOR PUBLIC PARTICIPATION. FOR NON ENGLISH SPEAKING COMMUNITIES THAT ARE OTHERWISE ALL TOO OFTEN. OVERLOOKED THIS BILL ENSURES THAT REDISTRICTING MAPS ARE MADE AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC BEFORE THEY CAN BE ADOPTED. AND ALONG WITH OTHER TRANSPARENCY MEASURES SETS A MINIMUM OF FOUR PUBLIC HEARINGS TO ALLOW. FOR PUBLIC PARTICIPATION I HAVE AND WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE CITIES AND COUNTIES TO ENSURE THAT WE STRIKE THE RIGHT BALANCE BETWEEN COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT AND TRANSPARENCY. I THINK WE ARE CLOSE TO A RESOLUTION THAT WILL ADDRESS SOME OF THEIR CONCERNS RELATING TO THE BIRD IN ASSOCIATED WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF NOTICE IN TRANSLATION. AND I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE ASSOCIATIONS FOR THEIR ENGAGEMENT WITH MY OFFICE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN SENATORS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT TODAY I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. WITH ME HERE TODAY TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF AB EIGHT FORTY NINE R. NICHOLAS HI TORN. I WITH COMMON CAUSE CALIFORNIA AND SOPHIA GARCIA DELORES WORKED A FOUNDATION [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU TERM. OXEN SUPPORT GO AHEAD THANK YOU TERM BERGEN MEMBERS NICKEL SIDE ON REPRESENTING CALIFORNIA COMMON CAUSE. WE'RE STRONG SUPPORTERS OF AB EIGHT FOUR NINE WHICH PROVIDES A CRUCIAL SAFETY NET. AGAINST GERRYMANDERING AND CITY AND COUNTY REDUCING. REDISTRICTING IS ABSOLUTELY CRUCIAL AT ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT TO ENSURE REPRESENTATIVE AS WELL AS INCLUSIVE DEMOCRACY. UNFORTUNATELY SOMETIMES THE LOCAL REDUCING PROCESS ABUSED AND WAY THAT UNDERMINES REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENT MOST SIGNIFICANTLY BY CRACKING VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES RURAL COMMUNITIES WORKING CLASS COMMUNITIES OR MINORITY COMMUNITIES. THE WAY THAT DILUTES THE POWER OTHER VOTE AND UNDERMINES LOCAL POLITICAL ACCOUNTABILITY. THIS IS IN SIGNIFICANT PART BECAUSE UNLIKE WITH STATE AND CONGRESSIONAL REDISTRICTING THEY'RE ALMOST NO MANDATORY STANDARDS GOD LOCAL REDUCING TO PREVENT SUCH ABUSE AND TO ENSURE DIVERSE PARTICIPATION IN THE PROCESS. FOR EXAMPLE UNLIKE STATE AND CONGRESSIONAL REDUCING THERE IS NO REQUIREMENT FOR LOCAL REDUCING THE COMMUNITIES AND NEIGHBORHOODS BE KEPT HOLE. IN FACT OTHER THAN EQUAL POPULATION AND COMPLIANCE WITH THE FEDERAL VOTING RIGHTS ACT WHICH ARE FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS THERE NO MANDATORY CRITERIA AT ALL FOR LOCAL REGISTERING JUST DISCRETIONARY CONSIDERATIONS. THE CONDITION OR AND WHERE IS THE COMMISSION MUST ENGAGE AND AN EXTENSIVE HEARING PROCESS STATE LAW REQUIRES LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HOLD JUST ONE PUBLIC HEARING PRIOR TO ADOPTING A MAP. THERE'S NO PUBLIC AVERAGE REQUIREMENTS. AS A REULT MANY COMMUNITIES AND ESPECIALLY NON ENGLISH SPEAKING COMMUNITIES I DO NOT FAIL TO PARTICIPATE IN PROCESS AND MAY NOT EVEN BE AWARE THAT ITS CURRENT. THESE ARE OFTEN COURSE THE SAME CONSTITUENCIES ARE STARKLY ALREADY STARKLY UNDER REPRESENTED IN MANY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. IF YOU FOUR NINE FOR MAPS ACT PROVIDES POLICY GUARDRAILS TO STOP THE WORSE THESE ABUSES. IT OFFICE MANDATORY RANKS REDUCING CRITERIA MODEL CLOSELY OFF THE STATE CRITERIA WHICH PRIORITIZE KEEPING NEIGHBORHOODS AND COMMUNITIES INTACT. IT ALSO REQUIRES MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR PUBLIC PARTICIPATION INCLUDING MINIMAL FOR HEARINGS FOR MAP CAN BE APPROVED. IN A REQUIREMENT THAT CITIES AND COUNTIES ENGAGING BASIC CAMINO READS SO DIVERSE CONSTITUENCIES INCLUDING NON ENGLISH SPEAKING ONES. HAVE A VOICE IN THIS PROCESS. TOGETHER WE THINK THE CHANGES MAYBE EIGHT FOUR NINE WILL CONTRIBUTE TO MORE REPRESENTATIVE INCLUSIVE AND ACCOUNTABLE LOCAL MOXIE. ALL THESE REASONS WERE PROUD -- TO TONIGHT VOTE ON AB. EIGHT FOUR NINE AND AS A SPONSOR JUST LIKE CLOSE ALSO ECHOING THE COMMENTS OF THE SUMMER BONTA -- IN EXPRESSING GRATITUDE TOWARDS LEAGUE OF CITIES AND SEE SACRIFICE VERY PRODUCTIVE DISCUSSIONS -- TOWARDS POTENTIAL MEMON STRESSING THE BURDENS CONCERNS AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THEM THIS BILL PROCEEDS THANK YOU. THANK YOU. OTHERS IN SUPPORT [inaudible] THE MORNING. AMBERG I'M GONNA TAG TEAM WITH SEVERE GARCIA FROM DILLER SQUARE TOUGH AND ASIAN I'M DOOR ROSE WITH LEGAL AND VOTERS OF CALIFORNIA CO SPONSOR IN IN SUPPORT. SO AS YOU KNOW THE LEAGUE HELPED LEAD THE FIGHT FOR STATE. LEVEL REDISTRICTING AND ALL THE CRITERIA OF THAT INCLUDES OUR LOCAL LEAGUES WORK HARD TO ENSURE THAT LOCAL REDISTRICTING PROCESS IS TRANSPARENT. THE PUBLIC CORPORATE DECISIONS REALLY ROBUST AND AND MEANINGFUL. THAT EVERY COMMUNITIES ENGAGED IN THAT PROCESS SO THAT THE LINE DRAWING RESULT IN A FAIR REPRESENTATION OF THE DIVERSITY IN THE AREA. BUT IT IS A SISYPHUS IN STRUGGLE WHEN DISTRICT MAPS ARE DRAFTED INTRODUCED IN THE DOCTOR ALL AT ONCE WITHOUT FIRST BEING PUBLISHED AND SHARED WITH THE PUBLIC THERE'S JUST NO ROOM FOR PUBLIC PARTICIPATION. OR WHEN THERE'S NO HARD STANDARD REQUIRING THAT CITIES AND COUNTIES REDISTRICT WITH A FOCUS ON KEEPING COMMUNITIES INTACT WE CONSIDER TO BE CRITICAL. OR A MAJORITY MINORITY STATE BUT AS NICHOLAS TESTIFIED WE DON'T SEE THAT DIVERSITY REPRESENTED AT THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT LEVEL. WE NEED TO INSTITUTIONALIZE PUBLIC OUTREACH TO MAKE LINE DRYING AND INCLUSIVE EXERCISE WE NEED TO BE ACCESSIBLE TO PEOPLE WHOSE FIRST LANGUAGE MAY NOT BE ENGLISH. OF THE WORK WITH THAT WE DO AT THE STATE LEVEL PROVIDES A CLEAR NATIONAL STANDARD OF EXCELLENCE SO NOW IT'S TIME TO FIX REDISTRICTING IN CITIES AND COUNTIES BY REQUIRING THAT SAME KIND OF TRANSPARENCY. BY LAYING IT ALL OUT IN IN A IN A FAIR -- AND TRANSPARENT MANNER IT [inaudible] END OF CREATING CONSISTENT CRITERIA WHICH IS A BIG PART OF WHAT THIS BILL DOES. FOR THE LOCALITIES TO BE ABLE TO USED TO BE HAVE SOMETHING TO HANG THEIR HAT ON SO WE HOPE THAT YOU'RE GOING TO JOIN US IN SUPPORTING A. B. -- A FORTY NINE AND TO BRING CALIFORNIA ONE STEP CLOSER TO REALLY A MORE REPRESENTATIVE DEMOCRACY WITH ATTITUDE EVERY DISAPPEAR. HELLO OUR MOTION THANK YOU HI MY NAME IS SEVERE SEE I'M WITH THE DOORS WERE THE FOUNDATION AS A G. I. S. ANALYST. I'M HERE REALLY SPEAKING FOR HOW. GREAT THIS BILL WOULD BE EN PROVIDING A LOT OF RESOURCES FOR THE COMMUNITY I WE'VE BEEN IN PART OF A COUPLE OF REDISTRICTING EFFORTS IN THE COUNTY OF KERN. AND BECAUSE WE HAVE THE J. S. DEPARTMENT AT THE DEALERS WERE THE FOUNDATION WERE ABLE TO TELL OUR COMMUNITY MEMBERS. ABOUT THE DATA ABOUT THE REDISTRICTING PROCESS BECAUSE IT IS A PRETTY COMPLICATED PROCESS AND BY HAVING AN IN HOUSE -- DEPARTMENT WERE ABLE TO GUARD TO THE COMMUNITY AND REALLY ADVOCATE FOR THESE MAPS AND SO AB EIGHT FOUR NINE OUT WOULD A PARTNER WITH GOOD GOVERNMENT ORGANIZATIONS LIKE THE DOORS WERE THE FOUNDATION AND OTHER. PARTNER AGREES ASIANS LIKE OURSELVES WHO ALREADY GO TO THESE DISTRICT MEETINGS AT THE COUNTY LEVEL AT THE CITY LEVEL AND THEN WILL ABLE. TO BUY WILL BE ABLE TO PROVIDE EN MASSE -- THIS COMMUNITY MEMBERS TO GO AND LEARN ABOUT THIS REDISTRICTING PROCESS THE LANGUAGE ACCESS M. IS ALSO A REALLY IMPORTANT PART HERE BECAUSE THERE'S NOT ONLY A HEAVILY SPEAKING OF SPANISH POPULATION IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND KERN COUNTY PARTICULAR. BUT WE ALSO HAVE OTHER I'M COMMUNITIES LIKE THE PUNJAB BE COMMUNITY WHICH WHEN THEY GO TO THESE MEETINGS AND THEY DON'T HAVE LANGUAGE AREN'T REALLY ABLE TO ONE UNDERSTAND WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING BUT ALSO. JUST UNDERSTAND THAT REDISTRICTING PROCESS AS WELL AND ALSO BEING A DATA PERSON WE REALLY KNOW HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO PROVIDE THOSE MAPS AND THAT DATA BE TRANSPARENT WITH THE PUBLIC. AND ALLOW FOR THEM -- AS A GOOD GOVERNMENT ORGANIZATION TO REVIEW THOSE MAPS WITH THEIR COMMUNITY MEMBERS TO REALLY TELL THEM IF THAT THE VERY AS A FAX OF YOU KNOW ONE LINE GOING ABOVE A COMMUNITY OR OR GOING BY LAW -- BELOW AND IN TERMS OF GOING INTO THE DATA -- SO WE WE ARE REALLY EXCITED AND AND HOPE THAT -- THAT THIS BILL AB EIGHT FOUR NINE WILL PASS BECAUSE IT WILL BE A GREAT EFFORT FOR THE COMMUNITY AND WILL REALLY ALLOW FOR THEM TO BE A PART OF THIS DEMOCRATIC PROCESS.

HAVING YET ANOTHER UNFUNDED LIABILITIES A CHALLENGE THAT BEING SAID WE HAVE BEEN WORKING DILIGENTLY WITH THE AUTHOR AND SPONSORS TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN GET TO A PLACE WE WE FEEL COMFORTABLE -- AND AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN WE CAN FIND A RESOLUTION -- PRIOR -- TO THE BILL GETTING OUT TO OF GOVERNANCE AND FINANCE SO WHEN I THINK THE AUTHORS SPONSORS HOPEFULLY WE CAN GET THERE. URINE OPTIMISTIC OPPOSITION OPTIMISTIC OPPOSITION WOULD BE ACCURATE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN BURST JEAN HER SEARCH AND WE HAVE FOR THE URBAN COUNTIES OF CALIFORNIA AND THE RURAL COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES OF CALIFORNIA ALSO HEAR AN OPTIMISTIC OPPOSITION. WE TOO I APPRECIATE THE WORK OF THE AUTHOR AND THE SPONSOR AND HELPING US GET TO A PLACE WHERE YOU CAN FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH THE LANGUAGE SO WE LOOK FORWARD. TO THAT THANK YOU BUT OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. ONE IS REVENUE FROM THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUES AT THE TABLE. ALSO AN OPTIMISTIC OPPOSITION. OKAY. WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE AT THIS POINT AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER BONTA AND I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN WORKING DILIGENTLY IN FACT AYE AYES YOU TEXTED ME AT TEN FOURTEEN LAST NIGHT I'M GLAD TO SEE THE FOLKS IS SIMILAR GETTING OVERTIME PAY NOW. SO -- IT ADDRESSING THE THE CONCERN WITH RESPECT TO EXPENSES AND AND UNFUNDED MANDATES. HE WOULD SPEAK TO THAT YES TOM. THERE HAVE BEEN VERY FEW STANDARDS. AND RULES AND GUIDELINES THAT MAKE LOCAL REDISTRICTING FAIR SO. WE'RE GONNA DO SOMETHING TO CHANGE THE STATUS QUO THERE WILL BE SOME COSTS AND SOME BURDENS -- BUT WE DON'T WANT TO JUMP HEADLONG INTO THOSE CASA BIRDS WITHOUT BEING THOUGHTFUL AND BEING REASONABLE WITH. A BOUNTY THE VALUES THAT THAT ARE BEING THE GUY THAT'S BEEN ADDED -- WITH WITH SOME. DOT THE TO THE COSTS THAT ARE BEING INCURRED SO. WE HAVE SHARED WITH YOU AND YOUR STAFF AND A BLUEPRINT THAT WE THINK IS A BLUEPRINT THAT SHOULD WE GET OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE CAN HELP US. STRIKE THE RIGHT BALANCE BETWEEN COSTS -- AND FAIR DEMOCRACY AS WE GO FORWARD AND WE'RE HOPING THAT WE COULD TAKE THOSE OF THE SECOND COMMITTEE AS BEFORE THERE ARE DISCUSSIONS WITH WITH OUR WITH THOSE WHO ARE AN OPTIMISTIC. OPPOSITION AT AT THE MOMENT -- THESE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE -- LOCAL MANDATES THAT THAT ARE FUNDED AND THAT IS THE INTENTION -- WEEK WE KNOW THAT THAT BUT SOME OF THE HISTORY HAS BEEN WAS SUSPENDED MANDATES AND THAT IS NOT WHAT WE WERE SEEKING TO DO WE'RE STICKING AFFAIR DEMOCRACY -- BUT WE WE HAVE BEEN THOUGHTFUL I BELIEVE IN TERMS OF LISTENING TO THE CONCERNS AND HAVE OPPOSE QUITE A FEW AMENDMENTS THAT CAN HELP REDUCE COSTS REDUCE BURDEN. AND GET TO A PLACE WHERE I HOPE OUR OPPONENTS WILL BE ABLE TO GO NEUTRAL [inaudible] ALL RIGHT [inaudible] HERTZBERG. PART OF THIS LAW. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE TO ENGAGE IN REDISTRICTING EVERY TEN YEARS. YES. THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES REQUIRE THAT THEY RE DRAW THE LINES EVERY TEN YEARS YES [inaudible] YOU'RE WALKING. DOES THE YOUR QUESTION AIDED WITH THAT. YES THERE ARE HAVE TO DRAW MAPS YES DO THEY HAVE TO BE CONSTITUTIONALLY PERMISSIBLE YES. WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE. I SPENT YEARS WORKING ON THE STUFF YOU KNOW MISTER BONTA IT FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND I THINK THE ARGUMENT IT'S LIKE TO ASK A LOCAL GOVERNMENT THAT THEY GOT TO COUNT VOTES AND SAYING WELL THAT'S A LOCAL MANDATE. IT'S THE CONSTITUTION AND IS THE BASIS OF GOVERNMENT AND ALL YOU'RE DOING NOW IS MAKING A DETERMINATION AND TAKING OUT OF THE HANDS OF THE ELECTED POLITICIANS. WHO ARMED RIGHTLY OR WRONGLY ARE OFTEN JUDGE IN A WAY OF SELF DEALING AND WHAT WE'VE LEARNED ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY WHEN WE'VE HAD THESE COMMISSIONS AND WE'VE LOOKED AT THE LAWS OF THE LAST FIFTY YEARS OF THE SUPREME COURT CASES? THE MANDATED ALL OF THE CONTIGUOUS NATURES AND COMMUNITIES OF INTEREST AND ALL THE LAWS. THAT THIS ISN'T REALLY THAT MUCH DIFFERENT AND THAT ALL IT'S DOING IS CHANGING A PROCESS THAT WOULD EXIST IN ANY OF IT AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS BECAUSE THEY'RE GONNA DRAW. AND THEN I THINK THE ARGUMENTS ABOUT COSTS ARE DISINGENUOUS AND THAT THEY BECAUSE THERE ARE COSTS THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO DO MAPS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO EVERYTHING ELSE THE QUESTION IS. WHO DOES IT? AND IS IT ARE YOU SAYING THAT YOU GOT TO DO OUT REACH AND TALK TO THE FOLKS IN THE COMMUNITY IN ORDER TO GET INPUT. IS THAT SOMETHING WHERE THE GOVERNMENT IS MAKING A MANDATE THAT SOUND REASONABLE AND CONSISTENT WITH THE CONSTITUTION WE'RE JUST TELLING PEOPLE YOU GOT TO DO YOUR JOB THAT YOU CAN'T DO IT IN THE BACK ROOM THAT YOU GOT TO CHANGE UP THE GAME. AND SO I THINK THAT WE HAVE SEEN THIS WORK IN A PRETTY BRILLIANT WAY. THE ARGUMENTS THAT YOU KNOW PARTISANSHIP BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AREN'T PARTISAN BUT IF YOU LOOK AT ALL THE OTHER CONSTITUTIONAL CASES THAT HAVE BEEN LITERALLY FIFTY YEARS SINCE THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT IN. NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE SEVEN FORM THIS PROCESS I DON'T BELIEVE YOU DO A THING THAT'S ADVERSE TO WILL THIS OR IMPOSING ANY OBLIGATION. AND I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE ARGUMENTS ABOUT THIS WILL AFFECT THEIR PENSION CONTRIBUTIONS IS THEIR ARGUMENT IT'S ABOUT POWER. AND SIMPLE AND THIS IS A GREAT PROCESS TO GREAT BILL THANKS FOR BRINGING FORWARD I LOVE TO BE ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR OF THIS MEASURE AND I LOVE TO MAKE THE MOTION THE TIME APPROPRIATE MISTER CHAIRMAN. RIGHT OF THANK YOU SENATOR HERTZBERG I'D LIKE TO HAVE YOU AS A CO AUTHOR THANK YOU FOR THE MOTION. THANK YOU SEVEN HERTZBERG ASSUME THAT THAT WAS QUESTIONS HE SAID ISN'T IT TRUE AT THE SO -- I DON'T KNOW THERE'S A THE RESPOND TO BUT ASSEMBLY MEMBER BONTA WOULD LIKE TO RESPOND I MEAN. I WHAT I I THINK EVERYTHING WE'RE DOING IS CONSISTENT WITH THE CONSTITUTION. WE ARE PROVIDING SPECIFIC STANDARDS IN AND RULES THAT I THINK. A TEASE OUT -- WHAT IS SPECIFICALLY SHOULD BE THAT WERE BEING PRESCRIPTIVE I THINK WITHOUT BEING OVERLY PRESCRIPTIVE I I DO AGREE THAT -- THERE ARE COSTS AND THERE IS WORK TO BE DONE TO ENSURE A STRONG DEMOCRACY. AND THIS IS PART OF THAT SOMETIMES I'VE BEEN FAIR AND HONORING OUR DEMOCRACY -- TAKES EFFORT AND AND TAKES COSTS SO -- I APPRECIATE SENATOR HERTZBERG PASSIONATE SUPPORT OF THE BILL THANK YOU. IN TERMS OF OF THIS BILL THIS BILL DOES NOT REQUIRE ANY JURISDICTION TO FOR EXAMPLE HAVE DISTRICT ELECTIONS CORRECT. THAT'S CORRECT AND THE ARE YOU CONCERNED THAT THIS MAY BE A DISINCENTIVE FOR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO ADOPT -- BY DISTRICT ELECTIONS. ONE COMING ON THE ROAD. SENDER I'D I DON'T THINK THIS BILL WILL BEAR ONE WAY OR ANOTHER AS TO THE DECISION OF DISTRICTS THE MAIN DRIVER FROM MOVING TO DISTRICTS AS MEN. I CHALLENGES RELATING TO MINORITY REPRESENTATION AND IT HASN'T BEEN SO I DON'T THINK THE THE PROCEDURES FOR DRAWING THE DISTRICTS WILL NECESSARILY AFFECT. OTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SEEING NONE OF THE HERTZBERG WAS GOING TO MOVE -- TURNER STERN MOVES ALL RIGHT -- THEM -- THIRTY SORRY. HEY I THINK YOUR POINT IS WELL I I THINK THAT WE'RE NOT TRYING TO DRIVE THE DECISION IN CENTER DISINCENTIVE DECISION. TO GO TO DISTRICT ALEXIS WE THINK THAT HAPPENS BASED ON A DIFFERENT STANDARD OF DIFFERENT APARTMENTS HI BUT ONCE THE DISTRICT ELECTIONS ARE IN PLAY WHEN REDISTRICTING WE THINK WE HAVE A AND AN APPROPRIATE APPROACH TO HOW THAT SHOULD BE DONE FAIRLY AND AND DEMOCRATICALLY. THANKS FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION APPRECIATE THE ROBUST DISCUSSION I RESPECTFULLY ASK DR -- THANKS AND I KNOW IT IS YOU YOU MENTIONED DOES MENTION YOU WORKING HARD ON THIS AND I KNOW YOU'LL KEEP PARK.

BEFORE I BEGIN I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR ASSISTANCE IN ACCOMMODATING THE AMENDMENT THAT IS ON ONE OF THE BOTTOM OF PAGES. PAGE EIGHT OF THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS WHICH I'M HAPPY TO ACCEPT AS AN AUTHORS AMENDMENT. STATE AND FEDERAL LAW REQUIRE ELECTIONS OFFICIALS TO CONDUCT PERIODIC RESIDENCY CONFIRMATION PROGRAMS TO VERIFY THE ADDRESSES OF REGISTERED VOTERS. IF THE ELECTIONS OFFICIAL RECEIVES INFORMATION FROM THE US POSTAL SERVICE THE INDICATES THAT A VOTER HAS MOVED. THAT VOTERS REGISTRATION BECOMES INACTIVE IN THE ELECTIONS OFFICIAL SENDS A NOTIFICATION TO THE VOTERS LAST KNOWN ADDRESS. THE INACTIVE LIST VOTER SERVICES SAFEGUARDS TO PROTECT VOTERS FROM BEING DISENFRANCHISED DUE TO INACCURATE INFORMATION WHILE ALSO ENSURING THAT ELECTIONS OFFICIALS HAVE THE TOOLS THEY NEED TO KEEP VOTER REGISTRATION RECORDS UP TO DATE. VOTERS REGISTRATION IS AN ACTIVE REMAINS ELIGIBLE TO VOTE BUT DOES NOT RECEIVE ELECTIONS RELATED MATERIALS IN THE MAIL. AN INACTIVE VOTER REGISTRATION EVENTUALLY MAYBE CANCEL THE VOTER DOES NOT VOTE OVER THE COURSE OF APPROXIMATELY A FOUR YEAR PERIOD. IN KEEPING WITH THE STATE'S COMMITMENT TO DEVELOPING POLICIES THAT PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF VOTERS. AB FIVE OH FOUR EXPANDS THE TOOLS THAT MAY BE USED TO CONFIRM THE RESIDENTS ADDRESS OF REGISTERED VOTERS. SPECIFICALLY AB FIVE OH FOUR PROVIDES THAT IF VOTER CONFIRMS THEIR ADDRESS BY LOGGING INTO THE SECRETARY OF STATE'S MY VOTER STATUS WEBSITE. THAT CONFIRMATION AN SHORES THAT THE VOTERS REGISTRATION REMAINS ACTIVE OR MAKES THE REGISTRATION ACTIVE AGAIN IF IT WAS AN ACTIVE. AB FIVE OH FOUR ALSO ENSURES THE VOTERS REGISTRATIONS ARE NOT MADE IN ACTIVE UNLESS THE ELECTIONS OFFICIAL RECEIVES INFORMATION. FROM A GOVERNMENTAL ENTITY THAT INDICATES THAT THE VOTER HAS MOVED. TO ENSURE CONSISTENT APPLICATION THROUGHOUT THE STATE AB FIVE OH FOUR ALSO CLARIFIES RESIDENCY CONFIRMATION PROCEDURES THAT COUNTY ELECTIONS OFFICIALS MUST FOLLOW. SB FIVE OH FOUR IS SPONSORED BY SECRETARY OF STATE -- EXPEDIA AND IS SUPPORTED BY THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF CLERKS IN ELECTIONS OFFICIALS IN THE AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION OF CALIFORNIA.

LEYVA Y. LEYVA ICE. ALRIGHT WE'LL WE'LL KEEP THE ROLE OPEN. ALL RIGHT -- A. B.. SIX NINE THREE THANK YOU I'M A RESEARCHER. CONDITIONAL VOTER REGISTRATION ALSO KNOWN AS SAME DAY VOTER REGISTRATION IS A SAFETY NET FOR CALIFORNIANS WHO MISSED THE DEADLINE TO REGISTER TO VOTE OR UPDATE THE REGISTRATION. CURRENTLY A CONDITIONAL VOTER IS GIVEN A PROVISIONAL BALLOT WHICH IS PROCESS AFTER ELECTION DAY DURING THE CAMPUS PERIOD. USING VOTE COUNT THE STATEWIDE VOTER DATABASE I COUNTY ELECTIONS OFFICIAL IS NOW ABLE TO VERIFY IF A VOTER IS ELIGIBLE IMMEDIATELY. AN UPDATE THE DATABASE IN REAL TIME. THIS MEANS THE SAME PROCESS TO VERIFY CONDITIONAL REGISTRANTS ELIGIBILITY THAT CURRENTLY OCCURS ON THE BACK AND AFTER ELECTION DAY CAN SIMPLY HAPPEN ON THE FRONT END INSTEAD IN REAL TIME. THEREFORE EIGHTY SIX NINETY THREE WOULD AUHORIZE AN ELECTIONS OFFICIAL TO OFFER A NON PROVISIONAL OR REGULAR BALLOT TO A CONDITIONALLY REGISTERED VOTER. IF THE OFFICIAL USES VOTE CAL TO DO THREE THINGS TO DETERMINE THE VOTERS ELIGIBLE TO VERIFY THE PERSON HAS NOT VOTED AND CHECK IF THEY ARE INCLUDED ON A ROSTER IN ANY OTHER COUNTY. AND UPDATE THE VOTE COUNT RECORD TO INDICATE THAT THE PERSON HAS VOTED. IF THOSE CONDITIONS ARE NOT MET OR THE CONNECTION TO THE VOTER DATABASE IS INTERRUPTED AT ANY TIME. THEN THE VOTER WILL BE ISSUED A PROVISIONAL BALLOT. THIS BILL WILL IMPROVE THE VOTER EXPERIENCE AND LOWER THE NUMBER OF PROVISIONAL BALLOTS THAT NEED TO BE PROCESSED AFTER ELECTION DAY. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE -- AND WITH ME IS RYAN RONCO CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF CLERKS AND ELECTIONS OFFICIALS AND LOOKS ACTIVITY MARK AS WELL FROM THE SECRETARY OF STATE'S OFFICE. I THANK YOU I CHAIR ON BERGEN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I AM RHEIN RONCO PLASTER COUNTY CLERK RECORDER REGISTRAR OF VOTERS. AND A CULTURE OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF COURSE IN ELECTIONS OFFICIALS LEGISLATION COMMITTEE I WOULD BE PLEASED TO SPONSOR A AB SIX NINETY THREE AND WOULD LIKE TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER BERMAN. FIRST WORK ON THIS BILL. SB SIX NINETY THREE WILL PERMIT THE USE OF NON PROVISIONAL BALLOTS FOR CONDITIONAL VOTER REGISTRATION AND VOTING. A CERTAIN CONDITIONS ARE MET. WITH THE TWENTY TWENTY ELECTIONS RAPIDLY APPROACHING THAT THIS CHANGE WILL ALLOW ELECTION OFFICIALS THE OPTION TO IMMEDIATELY ADJUDICATE CONDITIONALLY REGISTERED VOTERS BALLOTS. IN SO DOING IT WILL HELP TO REDUCE THE MANY CONDITIONALLY REGISTERED VOTERS PROVISIONAL BALLOTS THAT WOULD NEED TO BE REVIEWED PROCESSED AND EDUCATED DURING THE POST ELECTION CANVAS PERIOD. I HAVING EVEN A SMALL NUMBER OF VOTERS BALLOTS IMMEDIATELY JUDICATA ENCOUNTERED. BY CONCLUDING THEIR VOTES IN ELECTION NIGHT RESULTS. WE ARE CREATING A BETTER VOTING EXPERIENCE FOR VOTERS WERE REDUCING THE NUMBER OF BALLOTS BEING PROCESSED AFTER ELECTION DAY WE'RE SPEEDING UP RESULTS AND WE ARE REDUCING THE ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN ON OUR STRESSED CAMPUS PROCEDURES AND TIMELINE. IF THERE'S ANY AMBIGUITY ABOUT A VOTERS ELIGIBILITY OR FOR COMMUNICATION WITH THE STATEWIDE DATABASE IS INTERRUPTED AT ANY TIME THE VOTERS BALLOT WILL BE PLACED INTO AN ENVELOPE FOR EDUCATION LATER. WHEN WE CAN CONFIRM THE VOTERS ELIGIBILITY ABOUT? I THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST DRIVE OUT. ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE THANK YOU SIR MADAM PRESIDENT. CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF FOR THE REASONS STATED WE ORDER SUPPORT THANK YOU. OTHERS IN SUPPORT. SENATOR PRESENT IN THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS IN SUPPORT. YOUR ROSE THE RIVER IS A CALIFORNIANS. A MAJORITY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CIVIL LIBERTIES ARE ADVOCACY. FRONT SUPPORT THANK YOU OPPOSITION. YES MA'AM. SURE GO AHEAD. COME OF THE TABLE LIKE. AND I KNOW THAT -- THE LETTER IS BEING PRESENTED TO EACH MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE. YES THEY ARE IN A MY NAME IS CALLING BRITAIN I'M WITH THE ELECTION INTEGRITY PROJECT CALIFORNIA. AND THIS IS OUR OUR LETTER OF OPPOSITION. OUR ORGANIZATION STRONGLY OPPOSES AB. SIX NINETY THREE WE BELIEVE THAT IT WOULD FACILITIES FACILITATE HEIRONEOUS REGISTRATIONS AND ENSURE THAT INELIGIBLE VOTES WOULD BE CAST AND COUNTED. OUR OUR MAIN ISSUE WITH THIS IS THAT SOUL SOUL RELIANCE ON THE VOTE CAL. A DATABASE WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS AS YET ON RELIABLE PURVEYOR OF SOUL VERIFICATION OF ELIGIBILITY TO VOTE. IN THE I. T. N. -- TO TWENTY SEVENTEEN HAD A LAWSUIT WITH CALIFORNIA. OF THE OVER THE VOTER ROLLS AND THEY HAVE VOTER ROLLS HAVE SUFFERED FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS OF MAINTENANCE NEGLECT. AND WE BELIEVE THAT IT WILL TAKE YEARS TO COME INTO FULL COMPLIANCE WITH THE FEDERAL LAW. AND UNTIL THAT COMPLIANCE IS COMPLETE WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT VOTE CAL CAN BE RELIED UPON AS A SOLE SOURCE OF VALIDATION FOR REGISTRATION OR ELIGIBILITY AND WE HAVE SOME EXAMPLES THAT WE LIKE THE COMMITTEE SERVES TO PAY ATTENTION. TO ARE USING LA COUNTY IN FEBRUARY. TWENTY TWENTY EIGHTEEN DATA. I WON'T GO INTO ALL THE DETAILS BUT THERE WERE OVERSIX THOUSAND SEATS. MUST ALSO VOTERS THAT WERE LIKELY REGISTERED TO MORE THAN ONE ADDRESS AT THE SAME TIME OF THERE WERE SEVEN THOUSAND ALMOST EIGHT THOUSAND SETS OF VOTERS THAT OR LIKELY REGISTERED IN TWO DIFFERENT ADDRESSES IN WITH IN LOS ANGELES. AND THERE WERE OVER OF FOUR THOUSAND RATE ASSESSOR VOTERS THAT WERE REGISTERED IN LA COUNTY. AND THE OTHER NEIGHBORING COUNTIES. IN ADDITION TO THAT THERE WERE TWENTY TWENTY FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY SIX LIKELY DISEASE VOTERS ON THE LA COUNTY ROLES. OF 50% OF WHOM HAD DIED WITHIN THE COUNTY BUT WE'RE STILL ON THE ROLLS. THESE ARE JUST JUST SOME EXAMPLES AND THERE'S MORE. LOW CAL IS ALSO MISSING IMPORTANT INFORMATION NEEDED TO DETERMINE VOTER ELIGIBILITY. AND DISTINGUISH ONE APPLICATION FROM THE OTHER. HOW ARE USING THE SAME VOTE HELICITY I. P. C. A DATA ANALYST IDENTIFIED SIXTY NINE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY LA COUNTY REGISTRANTS WITH NO ACCURATE DATE OF BIRTH? ALMOST TEN THOUSAND LA COUNTY RESIDENTS WITH MISSING FIRST NAMES. AND SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN LA COUNTY REGISTRANTS MISSING THEIR LAST NAMES. THESE ARE JUST A FEW REASONS THAT WE BELIEVE VOEPEL COULD NOT BE RELIED UPON AS THE SOLE SOURCE. FOR VALIDATION OF REGISTRATION ELIGIBILITY -- ONE OTHER FELLOW SEE IN THE IN THIS BILL IS THAT AB SIXTY NINE DOES NOT INDICATE HOW ELECTION DAY DECISIONS WILL BE MADE. THERE'S NO MENTION OF THE SEARCH CRITERIA TO BE USED WOULD BE DATE OF BIRTH LAST NAME FIRST NAME. ARE THESE ARE QUESTIONABLE CRITERIA GIVEN THAT VOTE CAL HAS BEEN SHOWN UNABLE TO IDENTIFY PEOPLE. REGISTERED SEVERAL TIMES IN ONE SINGLE ADDRESS. SEARCH CRITERIA CANNOT RELY ON DRIVER'S LICENSE NUMBERS EITHER. AS CALIFORNIA ALONG THESE VOTERS TO REGISTER WITH NO ID -- ALL QUALIFIED REGISTERED REGISTRANTS DESERVE TO CAST A VOTE AND HAVE IT COUNTED. THEY DESERVE TO VOTE WITHIN A SYSTEM THAT PROVIDES THEIR VOTE FROM BEING DILUTED BY HASTILY ACCEPTED VOTES THAT MAY NOT BE A LEGITIMATE. LAST MINUTE REGISTRANTS MUST BE SUBJECT TO THE AME LEVEL OF SCRUTINY AS ALL OTHERS AND UNTIL ALL PROPER PROCEDURES CAN BE FOLLOWED. THEY MUST BE ALLOWED TO CAST ONLY A PROVISIONAL BALLOT. AB SIXTY NINE MAYBE THE GREATEST THREAT TO ELECTION INTEGRITY IN CALIFORNIA. AN E. I. PCA STRONGLY OPPOSES THIS BILL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU MA'AM A NOTE FROM THE LETTER USE DISTRIBUTED YOU'VE IDENTIFIED AS AS IS ALSO INDICATED YOUR ORAL TESTIMONY A NUMBER OF ISSUES THAT YOU BELIEVE DEMONSTRATE IRREGULARITIES IS THAT RIGHT THAT'S CORRECT AND WHEN YOU. FOUND THIS INFORMATION WHAT DID YOU DO WITH THE INFORMATION THEY PASSED IT ON TO THE REGISTER OF VOTERS. IN EACH OF THE COUNTIES IN EACH OF THE COUNTY CS THAT AND WAS THERE ANY RESPONSE A WELL. WE FILED SUIT AGAINST THE SECRETARY OF STATE AND THE REGISTER OF LOS ANGELES COUNTY FOR FAILING TO MAINTAIN THEIR VOTER DATABASES ACCURATELY. OKAY AND THEY WON THAT SETTLEMENT. OKAY THANK YOU. OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. HERE WE GO. MY NAME IS GLEN MYERS SAID LIVE IN ROSEVILLE AND I'M REGISTERED TO VOTE I'VE WORKED ON POLLS ON ELECTION DAY. I'M A CONCERNED CITIZEN.

HOW WILL THE ELECTION OFFICIAL NO THIS IS THE CORRECT PERSON OR THAT THE INFORMATION PROVIDED ON VOTE CAL THESE EVEN CORRECT IF THE NAME SHOWS UP INFO CAL? IF THE PERSON HAS NEVER VOTED OR NOT VOTED IN THIS PRECINCT IT WILL BE IMPOSSIBLE TO VERIFY THEIR INFORMATION ON THE SPOT. THAT IS PRESENTLY RESEARCH IN MY COUNTY AND VERIFIED AND THE REGISTRAR'S OFFICE. THIS PROCEDURAL MAKE MORE WORK FOR THE ELECTION OFFICIALS AND WILL IMPACT THEIR ABILITY TO WORK CAREFULLY IN ASCERTAINING IF THIS PERSON SHOULD GET ON NON PROVISIONAL OR PROVISIONAL BALLOT. ESPECIALLY IN THE EARLY MORNING AND EVENING HOURS WHEN MOST PEOPLE COME TO VOTE I URGE YOU TO VOTE NO ON THIS BILL THANK YOU. A BRING BACK COMMITTEE QUESTIONS -- QUESTIONS.

IN ADDITION LOS ANGELES COUNTY IS WORKING ON A NEW VOTING SYSTEM WITH THE OPTION FOR VOTERS TO SCAN IN QR CODE IT BALLOTS. FROM THEIR PHONE TO THE VOTING TERMINALS AT POLLING PLACES. HOWEVER OUR ELECTION LAWS DO NOT EXPLICITLY RECOGNIZE THE USE OF SMARTPHONES OR TABLETS. AND SOME ELECTIONS OFFICIALS IMPORTERS OF QUESTION THE PERMISSIBILITY OF USING SMARTPHONES OR TABLETS AT THE POLLS. AB SEVENTY NINE SEVEN WOULD CLARIFY THAT A PERSON MAY NOT BE PROHIBITED FROM USING AN ELECTRONIC DEVICE AT A POLLING PLACE. PROVIDED THAT THE USE DOES NOT CONFLICT WITH EXISTING LAWS THAT ENSURE THAT VOTING IS PRIVATE AND FREE FROM INTIMIDATION.

I SEE ASSEMBLY MEMBER LOW HERE -- THIS IS OUR LAST BILL SO. IF THE SENATOR STERN OR HERTZBERG. IS WITHIN EARSHOT TO BE A GOOD TIME TO COME BACK. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF YOU HAVE SEEN THIS BILL BEFORE THIS IS AB FOURTEEN FIFTY ONE WITH RESPECT TO THE TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY ON THE DIRECT DEMOCRACY INITIATIVE PROCESS BY ENTERING THE COUNT BILLION DISCLOSURES. OF COLLECTING SIGNATURES AND ENSURING THAT THIS IS A GRASSROOTS EFFORT WITH ME THAT'S THAT'S FINE SUPPORT IS ALSO PRETTY BERMAN WITH THE CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE CRISTINA MONEY HAVE THE CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS. POLICE TO BE IN STRONG SUPPORT THIS MEASURE WE HAVE SUPPORTED THIS MEASURES IT BEEN BEFORE THIS HOUSE AND THE OTHER HOUSE. MULTIPLE YEARS -- YOU KNOW THE INITIATIVE PROCESS HAS WAS REFORMED MANY DECADES AGO -- AT THE URGING OF THE VOTERS BECAUSE IT. THE YOU KNOW THE LEGISLATURE CAN OVERCOME BY INTERESTS AND THE PEOPLE HAVE NOT BEEN HEARD AND NOW WE HAVE AN INITIATIVE PROCESS. HAS BEEN OVERCOME BY INTERESTS AND THERE'S RARELY OF MOVEMENT BEHIND AN ISSUE THAT GETS TO OUR BALLOT WE'D LIKE THERE. TO BE. JUST A MINOR DEMONSTRATION OF A MOVEMENT IN THAT 10% A SIGNATURE TO BE GATHERED BY THOSE WHO BELIEVE IN ISSUE THAT THEY'RE WORKING ON A VOLUNTEERING IN THAT REGARD. I KNOW THAT THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER IS WORKING WITH OUR LABOR PARTNERS TO TO MAKE SURE THIS BILL IS WORKABLE FOR ALL CONSTITUENCIES AND WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT TODAY. OTHERS IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN VERS MUCH TIGHTER WITH THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION WE DON'T HAVE AN OFFICIAL POSITION ON THE BILL THE WE'VE COSPONSORED VERY SIMILAR ONE IN THE PAST. WE DON'T OF DECISION THIS TIME AS A RESULT OF SOME CONCERNS RAISED BY AFFILIATES BUT WE'VE GOT A CONCEPTUAL AGREEMENT ON SOME AMENDMENTS TO DEAL WITH THOSE CONCERNS IT'S OVER WORKING WITH AUTHORS OFFICE TO ADDRESS THOSE AND CAN HOPEFULLY COME ON IN SUPPORT. THANKS THANK YOU. OTHERS IN SUPPORT [inaudible] OPPOSITION THE MORNING MISTER CHAIR. YES OVER THERE WITH THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE. WELCOME TO CAL CHAMBER APPRECIATES THE GOAL PROVIDING OPPOSE BECAUSE IT WOULD CREATE AN UNNECESSARY LIMIT ON THE INITIATIVE PROCESS. ARTICLE TWO SECTION ONE OF THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION PROTECTS THE ABILITY OF CALIFORNIANS PARTICIPATE DIRECT DEMOCRACY SPILL THREATENS THAT RIGHT. AB FOURTEEN FIFTY ONE IMPOSES A FINE AND THREATENS CRIMINAL LIABILITY FOR EXERCISING THE PEOPLE'S RIGHT TO GATHER SIGNATURES TO QUALIFY AN INITIATIVE WE THINK THIS GOES TOO FAR. WELL THE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT THIS BILL IS NECESSARY TO ADDRESS THE PERCEPTION OF SIGNATURE GATHERING ISSUES THIS PERCEPTION IS NOT SUPPORTED BY THE DATA FROM THE STATE'S ELECTION FRAUD INVESTIGATION UNIT. JUST TASK WITH VIGOROUSLY PROTECTING INITIATIVE PROCESS. THE BILL ALSO SUGGESTS THAT THE SYSTEM CAN BE SKEWED BY WELL FUNDED INDIVIDUALS OVER THERE ARE MANY WILL FUND A NOT FOR PROFIT COMPANIES AS WELL. PROHIBITING HOW THESE PARTIES PAY THE PARTIES THEY HIRE TO DESCRIBE THE ISSUE TO THE PUBLIC. DOES NOT ADDRESS THIS ISSUE BECAUSE THERE'S NO COMPELLING EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THE PAYING ON A PERSONAL BASIS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED A CRIME UNDER THE LAW CAL CHAMBER RESPECTFULLY OPPOSES THIS. I PRINT LAYING A CALIFORNIA QUEEN MONEY CAMPAIGN I DON'T ALWAYS HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF WORKING SIDE BY SIDE WITH THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE HONOR. ON BILLS BUT I THINK THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT. IS ACROSS THE AISLE THECONCERNS THAT WE HAVE WE VERY MUCH AGREE WITH THE THE NEED AND CONCERN TO LIMIT THE UNDUE INFLUENCE OF SPECIAL INTEREST IN THE INITIATIVE PROCESS. AND WE'VE WORKED ON THE DISCLOSE ACT ANOTHER THING OTHER BILLS WITH. MANY MEMBERS A COMMITTEE HERE TO DO SO -- HOWEVER WE HAVE TWO MAJOR CONCERNS WITH THE CURRENT BILL IN TERMS OF POTENTIALLY SHUTTING OUT OF THE PROCESS A PARTICULARLY GRASSROOTS SORTS OF ORGANIZATIONS GOOD GOVERNMENT ORGANIZATIONS AND OTHERS THAT. DON'T HAVE WEALTHY BACKERS -- SO ONE ONE PROBLEM IS THE 10% THRESHOLD -- WE AS A COVER COMMITTEE CAMPAIGN IS A GRASSROOTS ORGANIZATION ARE VERY -- SYMPATHETIC TO THE IDEA OF HAVING TO SHOW SOME SORT OF GRASSROOTS SUPPORT -- FOR TO QUALIFY AN INITIATIVE THAT THE PROBLEM IS THAT A 10% THRESHOLD ESPECIALLY AFTER THE LAST ELECTION -- THAT HAD SUCH HIGH TURNOUT COULD BE -- IMPOSSIBLY HIGH FOR MANY GRASSROOTS ORGANIZATIONS -- TO QUALIFY THAT ARE THAT ARE REALLY RELIANT ON VOLUNTEERS FOR CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT TO BE SET ON THE SAFE SIDE THAT'S OVER A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND SIGNATURES YOU'D WANT TO HAVE TO GATHER -- THAT IS. NOT THAT MANY GRASSROOTS ORGANIZATIONS ARE GOOD GOVERNMENT ORGANIZATIONS ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO TO DO THAT -- WE PUT IN OUR LETTER THAT THAT -- THOSE CAN'T THE CONCERNS WOULD BE ALLAYED IT WAS A LOWER THRESHOLD LIKE 5%. ON THE OTHER PART IN THAT NOT I DON'T KNOW THERE IS A WAY TO RELAY THIS IS THE IDEA OF BANNING SIGNATURES BY BEING PAID. TING SIGNATURES BASED OFF OF THE UPPER SIGNATURE BASIS -- IT IT SOUNDS APPEALING ON THE SURFACE AND I CAN CERTAINLY SEE -- CONCERNS THAT SOME SIGNATURE GATHERERS TRYING TO GET AS MANY SIGNATURES THEY CAN THEY ARE ALWAYS THEY DON'T ALWAYS -- FOLLOW THE TRUTH IN DOING SO AND THAT'S WHY WE ARE WORKING ON SPONSORING SB FORTY SEVEN THE PETITION DISCLOSE ACT TO MAKE SURE AT LEAST THEY HAVE TO SHOW WHO'S WHO'S PAYING FOR THEM. BUT THE THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS IT'S GOING TO SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE THE COST. THE FLORIDA LEGISLATURE JUST A COUPLE WEEKS AGO. NOT PASSED THE BILL THAT TRANSPARENTLY WAS ABOUT LIMITING THE INITIATIVE PROCESS. THE SARATOGA'S AT TIMES HEADLINE ON THAT WAS FLORIDA LAWMAKERS PLACE BARRIERS TO BALLOT INITIATIVES THAT WAS THE HEADLINE OF THAT THERE WAS VERY TRANSPARENT ABOUT STOPPING. SLOWING DOWN THE NISHA PROCESS AND A KEY PART OF THAT BILL THAT THEY UNFORTUNATELY PASSED IN THE GOVERNOR SIGNED. WAS TO BAN PAYMENT OF SIGNATURES ON A PER SIGNATURE BASIS BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT IT COULD RAISE COST. ESTIMATES UP TO TWICE AS HIGH. NOW IF YOU'RE A A WEALTHY SPECIAL INTEREST IF YOU'RE A CORPORATION ORDER ORDERED OR ARE BIG LABOR UNION OR A A BIG BILLION HERE. A COUPLE EXTRA MILLION BUCKS IS JUST THE COST OF DOING BUSINESS THEY'RE GONNA PUBLIC SPEND A LOT MORE ON THAT AND THE SIGNATURE COUNTY PACE. BUT IF YOU'RE A GRASSROOTS ORGANIZATION GOOD GOVERNMENT GROUPS. THAT MAY BE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOUR INITIATIVE. BEING ABLE TO QUALIFY AND NOT SO THAT'S WHY WE ARE STRONGLY OPPOSED UNLESS AMENDED THOSE TWO PIECES THANK YOU -- AROSE WHEN I'M SORRY GO AHEAD. A BRIEF. DURAS LEGAL IN VOTERS IN CALIFORNIA AND WE MUST RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE A. B. FOURTEEN FIFTY ONE AND WE'VE APPROACH OPPOSE PRIOR SIMILAR BILLS. PROHIBITING THE PAYMENT OF PETITION CIRCULATORS PER SIGNATURE COULD SUBSTANTIALLY RAISE COSTS FAVOR WEALTHY INTERESTS. I REALLY DRIVE IN EQUITY THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS PAYING HOURLY. TENDS TO BE VERY EXPENSIVE AND MUCH LESS EFFICIENT AS AN ENTERPRISE. BY CRIMINALIZING CONDUCT THAT'S ASSOCIATED WITH SPEECH IN WITH DIRECT DEMOCRACY THIS BILL TRAVELS A VERY DANGEROUS ROAD ONE THAT'S DISFAVOR BY THE COURTS ALREADY. AND UNNECESSARY WE'RE SIGNATURE FRAUD DOESN'T APPEAR TO BE REALLY SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM. THE IDEA OF 10% OF SIGNATURES COMING FROM ON PAID CIRCULATORS FOR MEMBERS OF NON PROFITS WITH SKIN IN THE GAME. WHO CARE ABOUT THE ROLE OF AN ISSUE MAYBE LAUDABLE IN THEORY? BUT THERE ARE MANY LEGITIMATE ORGANIZATIONS DOING IMPORTANT WORK WHICH ARE NOT ORGANIZED AROUND A LARGE MEMBERSHIP AND COULDN'T MUSTER THAT LEVEL OF VOLUNTEER OR STAFF COMMITMENT. THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF THIS BILL COULD SIGNIFICANTLY BE WORSE THAN THE ABUSES AT THE BILL AIMS TO PREVENT AND SO WE ASK. FOR A NO VOTE ON THIS BILL. OTHERS IN OPPOSITION.

CHRISTOPHER LESS FROM CENTER HELL PLEASE OPPOSE ON THE WESTERN AND KEVIN. CHAIR OF THE CALIFORNIA THE MONEY ACTION FUND PLEASE OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED. NANCY NOW PHONE TWO WITH CLEAN MONEY PLEASE OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED. OKAY -- BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE QUESTIONS. YES CENTER LIMóN [inaudible] HERE -- SO WHAT IS THE AMENDMENT THAT THE OPPOSITION IS LOOKING. FOR THE CALIFORNIA MONEY CAMPAIGN IS LOOKING TO STRIKE THE BAN ON ON PAYMENT PER SIGNATURE BECAUSE OF THE EXTRA COST IT WOULD END UP. IMPLY -- WE WOULD REMOVE OUR OPPOSITION IF IF THAT WERE TAKEN AND THE THRESHOLD WERE LOWERED FROM 10% 25%. OKAY AND THE LEGAL VOTERS CALIFORNIA IS A STRAIGHT OPPOSE NO MATTER WHAT NO MATTER WHAT OKAY AS HE KILL CHAMBER OKAY I APPRECIATE THAT -- SO THE PERSON THE CHORE THE THE BAN ON THE PERSON YOU TO WHITE WHAT DOES THAT GIVE YOU HEARTBURN. A HONG KONG THEY HAVE A GIVES A HEARTBURN AND I THINK IT. EVERYBODY ELSE YOU WOULD AGREE THAT IT WILL SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE THE COST OF SECOND ORG. SIGNATURE GATHERING ESTIMATES A A IN IN FLORIDA THERE WERE PRESENTED WERE UP TO TWICE THE COST OF SIGNATURE DOWN BECAUSE YOU KNOW THEY'RE NOT. AS INCENTIVIZE TO GO OUT THERE AND FIND THE VERY BEST PLACES AT CENTER THERE'S LOTS OF REASONS WHY IN A PAYMENT PER HOUR JUST DOESN'T HAVE THE SAME. IMPACT AND AND AGAIN -- WEALTHY INTERESTS THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY A PROBLEM BECAUSE I'LL JUST PAY THE EXTRA TWO MILLION THEIR PUBLIC WITH A LOT MORE FOR AN INITIATIVE. BUT IF IT'S A A GOOD GOVERNMENT INITIATIVE IF IT'S A GRASS ANOTHER KIND OF GRASSROOTS INITIATIVE -- IT'S IT IT COULD BE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN QUALIFYING AND NOT WHICH IS WHY THIS IS SO IMPORTANT TO US. SO I WOULD JUST SAY FROM MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE -- I WAS IN THE LABOR MOVEMENT FOR TWENTY YEARS AND WE DID A LOT OF SIGNATURE GATHERING AND I HAVE SEEN THE THESE. THE SYSTEM JUST CHANGED DRAMATICALLY OVER THE YEARS THE HIGHER THE PRICE IS ON THE PERSON MITCHELL -- JUST ANECDOTALLY WHATEVER I HAVE FOUND IS THE MORE PEOPLE LIE -- AND YOU CAN ASK MY FAMILY AGAIN THIS IS ANECDOTAL BUT I AM THAT PERSON WHEN I'M WALKING INTO A GROCERY STORE WALKING INTO TARGET THAT'S GOING TO ASK THE SIGNATURE GET AND I DON'T SIGN ANYTHING ANYMORE BECAUSE I DON'T TRUST MOST OF THEM. SO MY CONCERN IS IF WE DON'T CHANGE THE SYSTEM. WE IT'S JUST GETTING WORSE AND WORSE YOU KNOW SO MY QUESTION ALWAYS IS TO THE SIGNATURE GATHERER. HOW MUCH YOU BEING PAID DO YOU ACTUALLY KNOW WHAT YOU'RE ASKING PEOPLE TO DO 99% OF THE TIME THEY HAVE NO CLUE WHAT THEY'RE DOING AND THEY WILL EVEN SAY TO ME? YOU KNOW -- I'M JUST TRYING TO MAKE SOME MONEY HERE LADY COULD YOU JUST SIGN IT AND I'M LIKE NO I WANT YOU TO MAKE MONEY BUT SO I'M WORRIED THAT THE THAT TH THE WAY WE PUT THINGS ON THE BALLOT -- AND PROPOSITIONS HAS REALLY COME BECOME VERY POLLUTED AND THE THE 10% SIGNATURE GATHERING. I MEAN I'M INTERESTED IN THAT BECAUSE WHEN I WAS WITH THE LABOR MOVEMENT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE TOYED WITH AND AND HOW DO WE I UNDERSTAND THAT VOLUNTEER. COMMUNITIES ARE VOLUNTEER ORGANIZATIONS AND NON PROFITS MIGHT HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF A HARD TIME WITH THAT. I GET THAT. BUT ON THE OTHER SIDE THE CORPORATIONS OR WHATEVER THEY HAVE TO FIND VOLUNTEERS AS WELL AND THEY'RE NOT GOOD AT FINDING VOLUNTEERS THEY'RE GONNA PAYING PEOPLE. SO THEY HAVE TO FIND 10% OF THE SIGNATURES THE VOLUNTEERS ARE PEOPLE WHO YOU KNOW COME FROM THE COMMUNITY OR WHATNOT. I DON'T KNOW THAT THEY KNOW HOW TO DO THAT THEY KNOW HOW TO WRITE CHECKS. SO I I APPRECIATE THE THE CONCERN BECAUSE I DO THINK THIS IS THIS IS A HARD SITUATION -- AND I WOULD ASK THE AUTHOR YOU KNOW IF THERE'S SOME WAY YOU GUYS CAN WORK OUT ANY. UNDERSTATES NOT GONNA WORK OUT ANYTHING WITH THE LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS WHICH WE LOVE YOU GUYS THANK YOU FOR WAITING. WE'VE JUST MIGHT NOT AGREE ON THIS BUT IF THERE'S SOMETHING YOU GUYS CAN WORK OUT YOU KNOW I LIKE TO JOKE AND SAY THAT IF EVERYBODY WALKS AWAY A LITTLE HAPPY IN A LITTLE UNHAPPY WE'VE REACHED A GOOD NEGOTIATION. I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY BECAUSE I DO THINK THE SYSTEM IS BROKEN AND WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING TO RAIN SOME OF THESE THESE CAUGHT. I AND I WORRY ABOUT THE COST BUT WE NEED TO RAINY AND WHAT CORPORATE AMERICA CAN DO AND I THINK BY HAVING SOME SORT OF VOLUNTEER PROCESS. CHANGES THAT -- WHETHER OR NOT WE CHANGE IT TO FIVE OR 10% -- I'LL LEAVE THAT TO BOTH OF YOU BUT I THINK THIS IS AN IMPORTANT OF ISSUE THAT I'D LIKE TO SEE THE BILL CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR OTHER QUESTIONS. SO SOME OF OUR LOVE. AND TO THE OPPONENTS A COUPLE OTHER QUESTIONS. I HEARD WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT THE ESTIMATED INCREASING COSTS AND ALL OF US ARE PRODUCTS OF OUR OWN EXPERIENCE. THE THREE OF US UP HERE OF ALL RUN FOR ELECTION BEEN INVOLVED IN ELECTIONS. I'M IN AND HOW DO YOU ARRIVE AT THE CONCLUSION VERY IMPAIR DATA THAT SAYS IF YOU PAY FOLKS BY THE HOUR IT WILL INCREASE COSTS. OF TIMES. TO I'M. I'M NOT AWARE OF EMPIRICAL DATA MAYBE. MAYBE THE THE CHAMBER IS -- BUT I THINK IT'S IT'S IT'S IT'S QUITE NATURAL WE WE AT HIGHER ORGANIZER'S AND AND WHEN YOU YOU NATURALLY GIVE ORGANIZER'S -- IN SIGNATURE GATHERERS INCENTIVES TO GIVE THEM INCENTIVES HEY YOU GET AN EXTRA TWENTY SIGNATURES THEN. WILL YOU'LL GET A FREE THEY WILL GIVE YOU A FREE TRIP TO STARBUCKS RIGHT DID JUST THAT SORT OF INCENTIVE MAKES A A BIG DIFFERENCE -- SO IT -- WE'VE TALKED -- TO OTHER FOLKS HAVE BEEN ENGAGED IN SIGNATURE GATHERING PROCESS. THAT'S AREN'T ALWAYS AT HIGHS DOUBLE IT COULD BE I'VE HEARD ESTIMATES AS LOW AS 20% OF AN INCREASE BUT EVEN A 20% INCREASE ON A PROCESS THAT MAY COST TWO THREE FOUR MILLION DOLLARS ALREADY. IF AGAIN IT'S NOT A PROBLEM FOR THE WEALTHY -- INITIATIVE. FUNDERS THEY CAN JUST PAY THAT EXTRA COST I MEAN IT IS A LITTLE BIT OF A IT'S DEFINITELY PROBLEM BUT THEY'LL STILL BE ABLE TO QUALIFY THEIR INITIATIVES WHAT'S GONNA HAVE THE PROBLEMS. EVEN AN EXTRA 20% THAT MEANS AN EXTRA FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND EXTRA MILLION DOLLARS IT HAS TO BE PAID. FOR A GRASSROOTS INITIATIVE FOR A GOOD GOVERNMENT INITIATIVE WHICH TYPICALLY IS NOT BACKED BY WEALTHY FUNDERS. THAT IS A SIGNIFICANT. PROBLEM TO INITIAL PROCESS BECAUSE IT'S MEANT TO IS MEANT TO ALLOW GRASSROOTS THE VOTERS TO BE ABLE TO QUALIFY. AS AN OPTION. ANY I MEAN I THINK THAT LORNE EXAM WILL BE THE BEST EXAMPLE OF EMPIRICAL DATA TO DATE AND THAT DOES SUGGEST THAT THERE'S ADDITIONAL SIGNIFICANT COST ME THE ISSUE FOR BUSINESSES OBVIOUSLY IS OUR EMPLOYEES ARE VERY ENGAGED AND INTERESTED IN THESE TYPES OF ISSUES. BUT THEY DON'T NECESSARILY ALWAYS HAVE TIME WE DON'T HAVE A LARGE VOLUNTEER BASE TO MOBILIZE WHEN THESE ISSUES COME UP THROUGH TALKING ABOUT PAYING THEM. TO DO THEIR WORK AND THEN PAYING THEM AFTER THE FACT ON A TO GIVE THEM AN INCENTIVE TO GO DOOR TO DOOR AND BE MORE EFFICIENT WITH THEIR TIMES THAT'S WHERE THE COST INCREASES COMMON. IN MENTION FLOWS THEIR DATA FROM FLORIDA THAT INDICATES THAT THE COSTS OR IS IT BETTER THEIR ESTIMATE I BELIEVE THERE IS AND I'M HAPPY TO LOOK INTO THAT PROVIDES YOU AFTER THE FACT THAT WOULD BE USEFUL -- OKAY IN IN IS AN EARLY VOTE ILLUSTRATES IS THAT WE ARE ALL PRODUCT OF OUR OWN PERSONAL EXPERIENCE AND SINCE ALL OF US UP HERE HAVE PERSONAL EXPERIENCE IN ELECTIONS HISTORICALLY. FOLKS WOULD DO VOTER REGISTRATION BY SIGNATURE BY VOTER REGISTRATION CARD. AND THEN AT LEAST -- I THINK ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE ALLEGED IT'S GONE THE HOURLY. TO INCREASE BASICALLY THE QUALITY -- AND SO OUR OWN EXPERIENCE LEASE MY OWN EXPERIENCES WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS YOU'RE INCREASING THE QUALITY OF THE REGISTRATION -- UP I'LL PUT THAT OUT THERE AND OTHERS CAN DISAGREE IN THE SECOND. OBSERVATION IS IN THIS IS OBSERVATION FROM ELECTION -- ABOUT ONE YEAR AGO IT -- I I OBSERVE FOLKS REPRESENTING THE RECALL PETITION WAS A REPEAL OF THE GAS TAX AND THE AT THE END THAT. WAS IT WAS CLEARLY A FALSEHOOD AND I THINK. PEOPLE ARE INCENTIVIZED TO TO LIMIT THE GAS TAX SIGN THE PETITION THINKING THEY WERE. SIGNED A PETITION DILEMMA THE GAS TAX AS OPPOSED TO RECALL SO I THOSE THOSE THOSE EXPERIENCES -- INFLUENCE MY JUDGMENT HAVING SAID THAT THOUGH IS THAT I AFTER MEETING WITH FOLKS I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THE 10% THRESHOLD I AM INTERESTED IN. REDUCING IT 25% I REALIZE THAT WE CAN'T DO THAT TODAY BUT I'D ASK THE AUTHOR WILL WELL IF THEY WOULD CONSIDER IF HE WOULD CONSIDER. REDUCING IT FROM 10% 25%. SURE I'M AT MY CLOTHES OR WHAT. WE WILL HAVE OTHER QUESTIONS BUT RIGHT. YOU CAN YOU CAN ADDRESS IN YOUR CLOTHES YOUR LIFE. OKAY ALL RIGHT THANK YOU SENATORS VERGE OF QUESTION. YEAH I MEAN I'M LOOKING AT THE ANALYSIS AND IT GOES BACK TO THE MISS CENTER LENO'S BILL IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIX AND THEN. COURT SENATOR CORBETTS IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINE IN THE BILL IN SIXTEEN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN YEAH AND THIS INDIVIDUAL CAN GO BACK TO FOR A LONG TIME BEFORE THAT WE'VE SEEN THESE THINGS INCLUDING A COMMISSION THAT I DID IN A PREVIOUS LIFE. ON INITIATIVE REFORM AND TRYING TO LOOK AT THIS TOGETHER WITH A NOT FOR PROFIT GROUPS THAT WE SPEND MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND CORPS INCLUDED -- JUDGES FORMER CHIEF JUSTICE IN OTHER ASSOCIATE JUSTICES SUPREME COURT AS PART OF THIS ENDEAVOR. TRYING. TO YOU KNOW. THE THE THE THE PUBLIC LOVES THE INITIATIVE IT IS EXTRAORDINARILY IMPORTANT TOOL WE GET THAT AND THAT IS IMPORTANT CHECK ON GOVERNMENT IN MANY WAYS. CERTAINLY I CENTER LABOR JUST TOLD ME I HAD THE SAME EXPERIENCE WITH MY IN REFERENDUM ON MY SB TEN ON BAIL WERE THE PEOPLE JUST SAY WHATEVER THEY'RE GOING TO SAY IN ORDER TO GET YOUR SIGNATURE IRRESPECTIVE OF THE TRUTH. THERE INCENTIVIZE OF COURSE BY ON HOW THE PAY STRUCTURE WORKS AND WE ALSO KNOW FROM THOSE OF US WHO'VE BEEN EXPERIENCE THAT THESE FOLKS THAT DO THIS STUFF TRAVEL FROM ALL AROUND THE COUNTRY. AND THEY JUST BUILT UP THE NUMBER AND WITH THE HIGHEST NUMBER IS IRRESPECTIVE OF THE ISSUE DOESN'T MATTER. THEY MAKE DECENT MONEY IN THERE THEY KIND OF THAT'S WHAT THEY DO AND SO WE HAVE BEEN GRAPPLING WITH THIS FOR DECADES FIGURING OUT HOW DO YOU BALANCE OUT ON THE ONE HAND. THE THE UNDERLYING NATURE OF THIS PROCESS WHICH IS. CRITICALLY APPROPRIATE IMPORTANT WITH WHAT'S TRANSPIRED BECAUSE WHEN YOU LOOK AT JUST I APOLOGIZE IF IS ALREADY SAID I'M SORRY JUST VOTING IN ANOTHER COMMITTEE. BUT WHAT HIRAM JOHNSON CAME UP WITH THIS THIS RUBBER FORM ALL IT WAS ALL ABOUT GETTING RID OF POWER IN SACRAMENTO WHEN IN FACT NOW WHAT'S HAPPENED IS IS OF FOLKS THAT HAVE MONEY. THEY'RE ABLE TO ACTUALLY OVERTURN THE POWER THE COMMUNITY THE LAST TIME I REMEMBER THAT WAS ALMOST A COMPLETE -- CITIZEN DRIVEN -- VOLUNTEER DRIVEN ENDEAVOR WAS NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT WITH PROP THIRTEEN I DON'T REMEMBER ANYTHING SINCE THEN. THAT HAS BEEN REALLY DRIVEN BY FOLKS VERSES INTEREST GROUPS ON WHATEVER SIDE OF THE THE TRADE THERE IS. WE'VE LOOKED AT THIS IS 5% AS THE CHAIRMAN HAS SAID. IN THE PAST FOR COSTS OF THE REASONS YOU KNOW IT'S ONE OF THESE FIGHTS THAT WE KEEP ENGAGING IN AND SOME YOU KNOW TOOK FORTY FIVE TIMES FOR THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT PASSED THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS SO. I THINK THE THE FACT THAT IMPORTANT PUBLIC POLICY ISSUES TAKE A LONG TIME ISN'T THE DECEIT REASON WHY YOU DON'T KEEP UP THE FIGHT. BUT I WOULD SUGGEST THAT FOR THE REASONS IF HE HAS NOT ARTICULATED THAT WERE TO GO TO IN YOUR ANALYSIS. THAT 5% AS WE HAVE DONE WITH THE NEWMAN BILLS IT WITH LENO AND WITH CORBETT AND EVERYBODY ELSE. PROBABLY MEETS THE NECESSARY THRESHOLD -- IN TERMS OF CREATING A BIG ENOUGH OF AN ORGANIZATION. THE LAST POINT I WANT TO MAKE IS ONE OF THE ODDITIES IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES JUST FOR HE RECORD IS. THE DETERMINATION OF HOW MANY VOTES ON THE SIGNATURE G. IS DETERMINED BY PREVIOUS SELECTIONS IF YOU HAD A REAL HIGH TURNOUT ELECTION ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU HAVE A REPORT AN IDEA YOU WANT TO PUT THE BALLOT. IT'S INFORMED BY A MUCH HIGHER THRESHOLD IN A LOW TURNOUT ELECTION KIND OF A LITTLE BIT IRRATIONAL BUT THE TO THE EXTENT THAT AT LEAST A 5% NUMBER YOU CAN GET IT SEEMS TO ME THAT YOU HAVE SUPPORTED THIS OVER AND OVER AGAIN OVER THE YEARS. BUT THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL AND I JUST AGAIN I YOU WANNA MAKE ANY COMMENTS ON YOUR CLOTHES WOULD BE GREAT I JUST WANTED TO ADD THAT IN FOR THE RECORD. BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN GRAPPLING THIS WAS SUCH A LONG TIME TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO CREATE A A APPROPRIATE INTEGRITY. IN A PROCESS THAT IS INFORMED BY THE PUBLIC ON THE ONE HAND. AND AND IT REALLY IT HERE'S TO THE UNDERLYING ARCHITECTURE AND POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY THAT IS SO IMPORTANT OF THE REFORM MOVEMENT OF A HUNDRED YEARS AGO. THE OTHER QUESTIONS OF OUR YES THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE COMMENTS AND THE ROBUST DIALOGUE ON OUR DEMOCRACY AND CENTER HERTZBERG THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE INSTITUTIONAL KNOWLEDGE ALSO THAT YOU PROVIDED. WITH RESPECT TO THESE ISSUES AT HAND -- ANECDOTALLY. MY EXPERIENCE WAS REAFFIRMED -- WITH RESPECT TO THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION I JUST COME BACK FROM THE GYM WEARING A BASEBALL CAP GOING OUTSIDE TRADER JOE'S. AND INDIVIDUAL APPROACHED ME AND SAID DO YOU WISH TO STOP THE TYRANNY OF THE SACRAMENTO POLITICIANS I SAID PLEASE DO INFORM ME ABOUT WHAT THIS IS ABOUT. AND THEY HAD SAID DO YOU WANT TO REPEAL THE GAS TAX AND I SAID WILL PLEASE EXPLAIN TO ME WHAT THIS IS ME SAID WELL YOU KNOW THE POLITICIANS ARE GOING TO BE USING THESE REVENUES THE BALANCE THE BOOKS SOMEWHERE ELSE. I SAID I THINK THEY'RE FACTUALLY INCORRECT AND HE SAID WHAT WOULD YOU KNOW. AND I SAID OKAY WELL LET'S HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT THAT. BUT AS WE BEGAN TO HAVE A CONVERSATION HE THEN SAW. AN ELDERLY WOMAN APPROACH HE MERELY STOPPED MID SENTENCE TRYING TO EXPLAIN OR TO HAVE THIS DIALOGUE. AND WINTER HER. AND I SAID EXCUSE ME I I'VE I% WANT TO BE INFORMED ON THIS AND HE SAID -- EXCUSE ME I'M GOING TO SOMEONE TO TRY TO COLLECT A SIGNATURE. AND I STOPPED AND SAID OKAY I'M JUST GOING TO STAND AND OBSERVE ANY REPEATED HIMSELF AND THE WOMAN SIGNED THE THE BALLOT -- THE THE THE PETITION. AND I STOOD THERE AND SAW HIM DO THIS DO THIS OVER AND OVER AGAIN. THERE WAS NO THERE WAS AN INCENTIVE TO GET THAT SIGNATURE NOT TO HAVE A FACTUAL CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT THIS IS REALLY ABOUT. AND SO WHEN YOU INCENTIVIZE THAT INDIVIDUAL FROM CHASE OF THE SIGNATURE THERE IS NO. TYPE OF INTEGRITY IN TRYING TO HAVING A ROBUST DIALOGUE WITH A FELLOW CALIFORNIAN AND A FELLOW VOTER ABOUT WHAT THIS IS ABOUT. AND THAT'S WHAT THIS FUNDAMENTALLY. IS DOING WHICH IS TO SAY THAT WE MUST HAVE TRANSPARENCY THIS BILL PROVIDES THAT YOU MUST HAVE DISCLOSURE OR WHATNOT YOUR VOLUNTEER OR PAID SIGNATURE GATHERER. WE WANT TO STILL ALLOW FOR INDIVIDUALS TO BE ABLE TO SOLICIT SIGNATURES BUT YOU'RE PAID BY THE HOUR BUT NOT BY THE SIGNATURE TO NOT INCENTIVIZE THAT TYPE OF BEHAVIOR. AND IN ADDITION AS YOU'VE OF PREVIOUSLY STATED -- WE CONTINUE TO LOOK AT OPPORTUNITIES TO MAINTAIN THE INTEGRITY OF A LOT THE TOTAL PROCESS. I'M I'M MORE THAN HAPPY TO COMMIT TO HAVING FOR THE CONVERSATIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE PERCENTAGE OF THE QUALIFICATIONS YEAH SHOULD THIS MOVE FORWARD INTO THE FUTURE -- BUT AGAIN I THINK THIS IS FUNDAMENTALLY ATTEMPTS. TO FOCUS ON THAT OF THE INITIATIVE PROCESS AND WHAT. FINISH THE PROCESS ABOUT. DEMOCRACY IN THE GRASS WAS PROCESS BUT YOU ALSO HEARD FROM CENTER HERTZBERG AS TO WHEN THE LAST TIME AN ACTUAL PEER GRASSROOTS INITIATIVE MEASURE ACTUALLY OCCURRED I THINK THE AVERAGE INDIVIDUAL HAVE SEEN. THAT SAID WHY THE LEGISLATURE WHY NOT DOING OUR JOBS WHY DO WE MAKING THESE DECISIONS ON THESE TEN PROPOSITIONS WHEN NO MEANS YES INVESTMENTS KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING YOUR JOB. AND WATER HERE'S OF FALSEHOODS THAT CONTINUE TO BE EXACERBATED IN THIS PROCESS AND AS SOMEONE WHO FORMALLY TAUGHT POLITICAL SCIENCE AT THE END THE COMMITTEE BECAUSE WHEN I TALK TO STUDENTS ABOUT THIS THEY SAID WHAT WHY IS IT SO OMPLICATED. AND WHY WE TELLING THE TRUTH THIS IS ABOUT TRANSPARENCY IN TELLING THE TRUTH AND WE SHOULD BE GETTING MONEY OUT OF THIS INITIATIVE PROCESS. TO TAKE AWAY FROM THAT OF WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH IN CHIEF AND YOU'VE HEARD FROM THE FELLOW COMMITTEE MEMBER AS TO WHEN THE LAST TIME SUCH A MEASURE. QUALIFY TO AGAIN -- I JUST -- AND IN THIS POSITION TO CARRY THE WATER IT FROM PREVIOUS MEMBERS OF THIS LEGISLATURE AND HELPING TO ACCOMMODATE THIS ISSUE AT HAND WHICH IS TO MAINTAIN THE INTEGRITY OF OUR ELECTORAL PROCESS AGAIN. I AM COMMITTED TO LOOKING AT THE A PERCENTAGE AS IT MOVES FORWARD -- SHOULD THIS NEW FORD AT THIS COMMITTEE THANK YOU. SO THANK YOU I THINK YOU'VE HEARD AT LEAST TWO OF US SAY THAT THAT WE'RE INTERESTED IN CHANGING THE 10% 25% SO I AM HOPING YOU'LL KEEP US. INFORMED AS TO THE PROGRESS IN NEGOTIATIONS AND I KNOW THIS IS GOING TO I THINK IT'S PUBLIC SAFETY FROM HERE -- SHOULD IT SHOULD MOVE OUT OF THE COMMITTEE -- SECOND POINT IS YOU LETTER SAYING DID YOU SIGN THE PETITION THE THE INDIVIDUAL THE NINETEEN OPPORTUNITY TO STOP THE TYRANNY OF THE SACRAMENTO POLITICIANS CORRECT I DISPUTE INSIDE ARE AND I WOULD I KNOW -- ALL RIGHT.
