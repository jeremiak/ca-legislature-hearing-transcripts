THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- CENTER THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME TODAY I JUST HAD A COUPLE QUESTIONS THE ISSUE OF CLARIFICATION AS I UNDERSTAND IT RIGHT NOW. THE STATUS OF A CURRENT LAW THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IS CURRENTLY IN CHARGE OF THIS OVERSIGHT. AND ENFORCEMENT óRDENES A WISER NEED FOR THE DVO ALSO TO BE EMPOWERED- TO OVERSIGHT THIS PARTICULAR TYPE OF INVESTIGATION. THROUGH THE CHAIR PLEASE SHARE- THE STAFF REPORT CORRECTLY POINTS OUT THAT ATTORNEY GENERAL CALMLY DAVIS IN TWENTY FIFTEEN SUIT- J. P. MORGAN IN ORDER TO ENFORCE THEM VIOLATIONS THAT THEY HAD THE CHALLENGE IS THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER SAID IT'S ON THE INDIVIDUAL DEBTOR IT'S NOT THAT THE ONE THAT WAS THE ONE TIME BASED ON ALL THESE COMPLAINTS THEY GET TO THE CONSUMERS HAVE A FEDERATION WE WANT TO HAVE ENFORCEMENT SO THAT THERE'S A REPORTING AND THEY CAN TAKE AWAY THAT LICENSE- IF THEY'RE- CONDUCTING- OF. BAD BEHAVIOR THE CHALLENGES BEEN THE WE'RE NOT CHANGING THE LOG OF THE LAWSUIT READS THE SAME THE CHALLENGES BEEN BUT YOU HAVE A LITTLE BIT BETTER WHOSE- DO YOU KNOW WHICH KID IS WRONGFULLY CHARGED FIFTEEN HUNDRED BUCKS IT DOESN'T MAKE ECONOMIC SENSE TO DO THAT IN THERE IN THE REAL pWORLD SO WE WANT TO HAVE THE AGENCY THAT WILL. IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF LICENSING WHAT AND EVERYTHING ELSE IS THAT THAT THEY HAVE A TEST THEY PAY A FEE THEY CONDUCT. AND RIGHT TO THE D. P. O. THAT I'VE I'M BEING HER BY. ATTORNEY I BEING BY THE DECK SO THAT'S THAT'S THE CHALLENGES JUST EIGHTY THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO TAKE AWAY THE LICENSE OR GIVE THEM ANCILLARY- RELIEF THEY CAN FIND. THANK YOU CENTER JUST SAID NO THE FALL QUESTION AND- BASED ON YOUR EXAMPLE YOU GAVE ME OF WITH THE DVL ALSO BE REQUIRED TO NOTIFY OTHER AGENCIES SUCH AS THE AG'S OFFICE- ON CASES JUST EVENT THERE'S NO DUPLICATION OF SERVICES. OR DATS- IF THERE'S INSTITUTION DATA COULD FACE ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS THAT THERE'S NOT MULTIPLE AGENCIES- GETTING INVOLVED IN THE SAME VIOLATION- OF FUTURE PLEASE THAT'S NOT EXPLICITLY PROVIDED FOR NOTICE IN THIS BILL GENERALLY THE-ATTORNEY GENERAL ASKS IS THE ATTORNEY FOR ALL THE AGENCIES SO. IF THEY MOVE BEYOND REGULATORY- ACTION IN THE ATTORNEY GENERAL WILL BE INVOLVED. THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING. ANY MEMBERS ASSEMBLY MCCANN FONG. THANK YOU A CENTER IF YOU COULD CLARIFY- FOR MEAT DOES THE NEW LICENSING AND REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS DOES DOES THAT JUST APPLY TO BUSINESSES IN THE BUSINESS OF DEBT COLLECTION OR DOES IT APPLY TO BUSINESSES THAT COLLECTS DATA- LIKE A- WATER BILL YOU KNOW OTHER OTHER AGENCIES SO IT'S WE'RE FOCUSING ON THE ACTIVITY THAT PEOPLE AREN'T INVOLVED. SO RIGHT NOW IS THE IS THE BANKERS TESTIFIED WE EXEMPT BANKS CREDIT UNIONS THOSE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ARE ALREADY THERE WE'RE IF YOU UNDER ROSENTHAL UNDER EXISTING LAW DEFINES WE PULLED THE LANGUAGE FROM THE ROSENTHAL ACT IT'S AS IF YOU CONTINUOUSLY ENGAGED IN DEBT COLLECTION AND THAT'S THE ACTIVITY THAT YOU'RE INVOLVED IN. THEN YOU WOULD BE REQUIRED TO GET THE LICENSE. THAT IS SO. FOR EXAMPLE OF IF I DON'T PAY MY CABLE BILL AND IT WOULD END THE NIGHT OCCURRED A DEBT THAT I NEED TO PAY BACK WOOD. WITH THE REQUIREMENTS APPLY TO. THOSE COMPANIES THE- NO NO NOT NOT NOT AN. ONE ABOUT YOU KNOW WHETHER IT'S A LAWYER WHO HAPPENS HAVE A LAW DEGREE BUT THEY ENGAGE IN THE DEBT COLLECTION BUSINESS CONTINUALLY SO JUST ONE CASE OR ONE OFF ON A CLIENT THIS IS A- PORTFOLIO OF DATA.
