THANK THANK YOU GOOD MORNING- I'M CALLING THIS HEARING TO ORDER WHEN I THINK YOU FOR JOINING US TODAY FOR ATIMELY DISCUSSION ON THE IMPORTANCE OF ADVERSITY BOTH ON CORPORATE BOARDS AND DOWN THE LADDER FOR ALL EMPLOYMENT IN CALIFORNIA. MY CULTURE MR HOLDEN AND I WERE BOTH EXCITED TO SEE SB EIGHT TO SIX BY. FORMER SENATOR HANNAH BETH JACKSON IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN REQUIRE WOMEN BE APPOINTED TO CALIFORNIA BASED CORPORATE BOARDS. THAT'S WHY IN TWENTY TWENTY MR HOLDEN TOOK THE LEAD ON AB NINE SEVEN NINE OUR BILL TO SET A MINIMUM NUMBER OF BOARD MEMBERS. TO BE FROM AN UNDERREPRESENTED COMMUNITY IN CALIFORNIA. THE REASONS BEHIND AB NINE SEVEN NINE THIS SOUND CITIES HAVE SHOWN THAT CORPORATIONS WITH A MORE DIVERSE AND EQUITABLE BOARD HAVE BETTER COMPANY GOVERNANCE AND HAVE BETTER DECISION MAKING. WILL BE WHICH LEADS TO A MORE SUCCESSFUL COMPANY. EVERY CITY IN EQUITY ARE NECESSARY FOR THE HEALTH OF THE COMPANY WHILE ALSO PROVIDING OPPORTUNITIES FOR THIS EXPERIENCE RACISM. MICRO GEISHA AGGRESSIONS ON A DAILY BASIS. CALIFORNIA'S UNDER REPRESENTED GROUPS. OKAY. CALIFORNIA'S UNDER REPRESENTED GROUPS SERVICE SEAT AT THE TABLE TO WHAT THESE BILLS HAVE BEEN LAW FOR OVER A YEAR NOW AND THE INTENTION FOR THIS HEARING TODAY'S UPDATE US ON THE STATUS OF IMPLEMENTATION I'M PREVIOUS EVER SEE LEGISLATION AND ALSO CONTINUE THE DISCUSSION ON THE VERSA FIND THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTORS FURTHER. BEFORE I HAND THIS OFF TO MY CULTURE ASSEMBLY MEMBER HOLDEN TO INTRODUCE SOME OF THE EARLY EVIDENCE OF THE BILL SYNTAX. I DO WANT TO MENTION A COUPLE HASHTAGS THAT WE WILL BE USING ON SOCIAL MEDIA. A. B. R. HAS TIED AB NINE SEVEN NINE. HI SIDE CORPORATE THEIR CORPSE EVERY CITY. AND HASH TAG OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL TO HELP TRACK THE DISCUSSION ON SOCIAL MEDIA- I WANNA ALSO WELCOME OUR COLLEAGUES WHO ARE HERE TODAY AND WE WILL DO A LITTLE MORE INTRODUCTIONS. AFTER THE OPENINGS ON ON THAT AND- FINALLY I WANT TO SAY THAT WHEN WE DID AB NINE SEVEN NIGHT WELL IT WAS A LANDMARK LEGISLATION MR HOLDEN AND I WERE WELL AWARE THAT THERE'S MORE WORK TO BE DONE AND WE HOPE THROUGH THESE HEARINGS THAT ARE STARTING TO DAY. WE WILL BE ABLE TO FIGURE OUT WHERE WE'RE AT AND WHERE WE NEED TO BE GOING IN ORDER TO CONTINUE TO CREATE- UP WORKFORCE THAT LOOKS MORE LIKE OUR SOCIETY OUT THERE SO WITH THAT I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE. AND PASS IT OVER TO MR HOLDEN. THANK YOU AS A MEMBER GARCIA. AND THANK YOU TO ALL OF OUR- PANELISTS WHO WILL BE JOINING US- THIS LATE MORNING AND- BEING A PART OF THIS IMPORTANT CONVERSATION I WANT TO INTRODUCE AB NINE SEVENTY NINE MY GOAL WAS TO START A CONVERSATION ABOUT DIVERSITY AND CREATE. A MATRIX THAT SETS A FLOOR FOR DIVERSITY NOT A CEILING. OUR EFFORTS THROUGH AB NINE SEVEN NINE AND S. B. EIGHT TWENTY SIX HERE IN CALIFORNIA HAVE BEEN CRUCIAL TO SUPPORTING DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION POLICIES ON A NATIONAL SCALE. AB NINE SEVEN NINE SERVED AS A CALL TO ACTION FOR BUSINESSES TO TAKE MEASURABLE ACTION IN LIGHT OF DATA THAT SHOWS THAT PEOPLE OF COLOR FACE BARRIERS TO GETTING HIRED. FACE HOSTILE ENVIRONMENTS AND MICRO AGGRESSIONS ONCE HIRED OBSTACLES TO GETTING PROMOTED. AND ARE NOT ABLE TO CLIMB UP THE LADDER OF SUCCESS. IN ADDITION TO THE ATTENTION THAT BOTH OF THESE LAWS HAVE ATTRACTED. COMPANIES ARE TAKING INTENTIONAL STEPS TOWARDS CREATING SUPPORTIVE WORK ENVIRONMENTS FOR PEOPLE OF COLOR WOMEN AND THE LGBT COMMUNITY. EARLIER THIS YEAR I ATTENDED EVENTS HOSTED BY THE SILICON VALLEY LEADERSHIP GROUP. AFRICAN AMERICAN BOARD LEADERSHIP INSTITUTE HOW WOMEN LEAD AND THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE DIVERSITY SUMMIT TO PROVIDE CLARITY ON THE INTENT OF AB NINE SEVENTY NINE. FROM THESE CONVERSATIONS AND EARNEST DISCUSSIONS. WE'RE SEEING MEASURABLE RESULTS. AFTER S. B. EIGHT TWENTY SIX BECAME LAW. THIS FIRST IN THE NATION LAW INSPIRED OTHER LOS TO FOLLOW SUIT AND THE NUMBER OF WOMEN ON BOARDS INCREASE SIGNIFICANTLY. BUILDING UPON THE SUCCESS OF S. B. EIGHT TWENTY SIX AB NINE SEVENTY NINE ALSO INSPIRED CHANGE ACROSS THE NATION. IN THE SUMMER OF TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY ONE NASDAQ SUCCESSFULLY CHANGED ITS RULES TO REQUIRE ITS MEMBER COMPANIES TO HAVE AT LEAST ONE WOMAN OR PERSON OF COLOR ON THEIR BOARD OF DIRECTORS. BOTH OUR OUR OFFICES WORK TOGETHER LETTERS AND SIGNATURES TO SUPPORT THIS EFFORT. AND THIS HEARING WE WILL CONTINUE THOSE CONVERSATIONS AROUND THE IMPORTANCE OF CREATING INCLUSIVE WORK ENVIRONMENTS AND HIGHLIGHT THE VERY REAL IMPACTS OF DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION POLICIES HAS ON PEOPLE AND BUSINESSES. WE WILL HEAR FROM MANY EXPERTS IN THIS FIELD AND HOPE TO LEARN MORE ABOUT WHAT THE LEGISLATURE CAN DO TO HELP EFFORTS AT IMPLEMENTING CURRENT LAW AND CREATING NEW LAWS TO ASSIST AND DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION POLICIES AT ALL LEVELS. OF EMPLOYMENT. NOW FOR A FEW REMINDERS BEFORE WE START TODAY'S HEARING- MASS OR REQUIRES SUCH A WITH LIKE UP STOP WILL SHOP START STOP REAL QUICK ON THE ON THE GOOD STUFF AND THEN WE'LL GET TO THIS TECHNICAL STUFF. OUR MASTER REQUIRED IN THE HEARING ROOM AND OTHER COMMON ERRORS TESTIMONY CAN BE PROVIDED IN PERSON AND BY TELEPHONE. THE NUMBER PUBLIC PHONE TESTIMONY IS. 877-692-8957 AND THE ACCESS CODE IS. ONE THREE ONE FIVE FOUR TWO ZERO TWO. THIS NUMBER IS POSTED ON THE COMMITTEE'S WEBSITE AND ALSO APPEARS ON THE VIDEO FEED ONCE WE HAVE CONCLUDED ALL PANELS WE WILL OPEN THE PHONE LINES FOR PUBLIC COMMENT. WE HAVE A HARD STOP AT TWO PM BUT WITH EFFICIENCIES OF I'M SURE THIS MEETING WILL PROCEED- WE COULD CONCLUDE SOONER THAN THAT. BEFORE WE BEGIN I WOULD LIKE TO LOOK TO THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS TO SEE IF THEY HAVE ANY. OPENING COMMENTS THAT THEY LIKE TO MAKE ALL STAR TO MY LEFT- SENATOR SCANNER IF YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS IT DOESN'T YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE ANY BUT IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO HAVE AN OPENING COMMENT WE CERTAINLY. WILL LOOK TO YOU TO HAVE THAT SURE THAT MOMENT NOW. THANK YOU- GERALD AND I'M GLAD TO BE HERE AND I'M VERY HAPPY THAT WE ARE PURSUING THIS BECAUSE WHILE WE HAVE LEGISLATION. WE KNOW THAT- IT. WE HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO TO ACHIEVE DIVERSITY. IN OUR- PRIVATE SECTOR AND EVEN THE PUBLIC SECTOR FOR THAT MATTER THOUGH IT'S BETTER IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR. AND CERTAINLY WE WANT UNDER REPRESENTED GROUPS WHICH INCLUDES WOMEN AS VICE CHAIR OF THE WOMEN'S CAUCUS. I'M TO BE IN. CBS'S HAMILTON SAID I WANT TO BE IN THE ROOM WHERE IT HAPPENS. AND IF WE'RE NOT THEN THE- DECISIONS THAT ARE MAE. ARE NOT AS- THEY'RE NOT AS GOOD DECISIONS SO I'M REALLY HAPPY THAT WE ARE THAT HE COMMITTEE LIKE THIS EXISTS BECAUSE THE TYPE OF OVERSIGHT THAT WILL BE NEEDED. WHICH WILL ALLOW US TO IDENTIFY WHETHER WE NEED TO STRENGTHEN BERRY'S POLICIES THAT WE MAY HAVE AND THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO RECOGNIZE BOTH THE SOME MEMBERS THAT NAY GARCIA AND CHRIS HOLDEN FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP AND ADDRESSING THIS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT ISSUE. FOR NOW THE CALIFORNIA AR ENTIRE COUNTRY SO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR CONVENING THIS HEARING. AS CHAIR OF THE ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDER LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS. WE ACTUALLY HELD AT WELL ACTUALLY AS CHAIR OF THE SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON API AFFAIRS IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE H. I. LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS WHICH I CURRENTLY CHAIR. WHICH SHE HELD A HEARING BACK IN SEPTEMBER TWENTY NINETEEN. AT THE SILICON VALLEY COMMUNITY FOUNDATION WE TALKED ABOUT THE GLASS CEILING FOR ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDERS- THAT PARTICULARLY WHEN YOU AND WE EXAMINED MANY DIFFERENT FIELDS AT WHERE. BASICALLY YOU SAW. API TO- CERTAIN SUBSEGMENTS AGAIN ONLY IF THE SIZE WE HAVE A DIVERSE COMMUNITY CERTAIN SUBSEGMENTS PERHAPS WERE WELL REPRESENTED IN CERTAIN FIELDS LIKE TECHNOLOGY OR MEDICINE AND OR SOME OTHER FIELDS BUT YET I NEVER WERE- WHICH TREMENDOUSLY UNDER REPRESENTED IN SENIOR MANAGEMENT POSITIONS C. SUITES AND BOARDS. AND I THINK THAT THE REASON I BRING THIS UP IS THAT- YOU KNOW SOMEONE WHO'S WORKED ON PIPELINE PROGRAMS IN MY CAREER CERTAINLY IN THE FIELD OF MEDICINE WHICH I'M IN THEPOSITION- I OFTEN HEAR. THAT WELL IT'S THE PIPELINE. AND CERTAINLY I'M NOT SAYING THAT THERE AREN'T CERTAIN PIPELINE ISSUES PARTICULARLY FOR MANY COMMUNITIES OF COLOR WHERE THERE ARE. THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH OPPORTUNITIES FOR ADVANCEMENT OF STRUCTURAL RACISM HAS PREVENTED- PEOPLE OF COLOR FROM BEING ABLE TO EVEN GET ON TO THE ENTRY RONNING'S BUT ALSO POINT OUT THAT. FOR THE API COMMITTEE WHERE FOR CERTAIN AGAIN ONLY CERTAIN SUBSEGMENTS- THAT EVEN WHEN PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO ASCEND INTO. SOME OF THOSE YOU KNOW A PROFESSIONAL POSITION AND SO FORTH. THAT THE PIPELINE IS NOT THE ISSUE. AND THAT'S AN EXCUSE. THE PIPELINE IS THERE SO WHY IS IT IN MY OWN FIELD OF MEDICINE THAT WELL WHAT IS THAT WHILE YOU SEE REPRESENTATION AT LEAST FOR CERTAIN SUBSEGMENTS AMONG THE FACULTY. WE LOOK AMONG MEDICAL SCHOOL DEANS. THE I THINK WE'VE ACTUALLY FOUND ONE. RIGHT A LOT OF CREDIT MEDICAL SCHOOLS IN UNITED STATES. RIGHT AND THEN LET'S TALK ABOUT CORPORATE BOARDS AGAIN IN FACT IF YOU TAKE TECHNOLOGY WHERE SUPPOSEDLY AGAIN ONLY CERTAIN SUBSEGMENTS OF THE API COMMITTEE ARE WELL REPRESENTED. IN THE TECH FIELD YOU DON'T SEE THEM IN THE C. SUITES AND THE BARS AND IN FACT. IT IS AND IF YOU TAKE OUT THE ONES WHO ACTUALLY FOUNDED THE COMPANIES THEMSELVES SO ONCE YOU FIND ARE OFTEN THE ONES WHO ARE ACTUALLY THE FOUNDERS OF THE COMPANIES. THEN THE NUMBERS EVEN WORSE. SO IT'S NOT BECAUSE OF LACK OF TALENT AND I KNOW OUR COMMUNITY STRUGGLES WITH THE MODEL MINORITY MYTH. IT'S NOT LACK OF TALENT IT'S NOT LACK OF EXPERIENCE OR SKILL TO THE DEGREE THAT THOSE OPPORTUNITIES AFFORDED OUR COMMUNITIES. IT'S FRANKLY RACISM. AND SO WE NEED TO RECTIFY THIS IN OUR CORPORATE LEADERSHIP IN OUR PUBLIC SECTOR LEADERSHIP. THIS NEEDS TO BE DEALT WITH IN THIS HEARING IS CERTAINLY A VERY IMPORTANT. DISCUSSION AND ALSO THE BILL AB NINE SEVEN NINE WAS VERY IMPORTANT POLICY STEP TO BE IN ADDRESSING THAT SO AGAIN I WANT TO THANK OUR CHAIRS AND- THE SELECT COMMITTEE FOR DRESSING THIS ISSUE AND FOR ALLOWING THOSE OF US IN THE SENATE TO JOIN YOU IN THIS HEARING. THANK YOU. THANK YOU CHAIR- A. I. ASSEMBLY MEMBER MIA BONTA. THIS IS MY FIRST AT SELECT COMMITTEE HEARING AND I'M THANKFUL THAT IT IS ACTUALLY SELECT COMMITTEE. ON THE IMPORTANCE OF ENSURING THAT WE HAVE MORE DIVERSITY AND OUR CORPORATE BOARDS AND IN THE CALIFORNIA. WORKFORCE OVERALL- AS AND NONPROFIT EXECUTIVE AND SOMEBODY WHO HAS COME THROUGH. AT WORK WITH MANY DIFFERENT CORPORATIONS AND IN THE NONPROFIT SECTOR I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW CRITICAL IT IS THAT WE HAVE. DIVERSITY REPRESENTATION- BOTH OF WOMEN OF PEOPLE OF COLOR. I MYSELF GET THE FORTUNE OF A PARTICIPATING IN THE WOMEN'S CAUCUS THE LATINO CAUCUS AND THE BLACK CAUCUS. HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE AND- AND BELIEVE THAT ONE OF THE WAYS THAT WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE REPRESENTATION IN OUR IN OUR COMMUNITIES. AS WE MAKE CRITICAL DECISIONS AT WHETHER IT BE AROUND HEALTH A- HEALTH JUSTICE ECONOMIC JUSTICE HOUSING JUSTICE. AT WORKFORCE JUSTICE IS REALLY THAT WE HAVE PEOPLE- AT THAT UNDERSTAND THE PERSPECTIVE AND THE EXPERIENCE OF WHAT IT MEANS TO NOT BE IN THOSE ROOMS. FOR FAR TOO LONG WE HAVE NOT BEEN IN THOSE ROOMS AND I REALLY APPRECIATE. AT YOUR LEADERSHIP ASSEMBLYMEMBER HOLDEN AND GARCIA AT IN THE SPACE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO. TO HAVE THE KIND OF DIVERSITY THAT WILL LEAD TO THE STATE IN IN IN IN A STRONGER DIRECTION. TOGETHER THANK YOU. WELL I WANNA SAY. ALL OF YOU FOR BEING HERE BECAUSE THIS IS- A SENATOR SKINNER POINTED OUT WHO GRADE LEGISLATION THAT HAS BEEN. LAID OUT THERE WHETHER IT'S THROUGH AND ABOVE JACKSON'S BILL TE BILL THAT WE'RE JUST- MODE FOUR NINE SEVENTY NINE. THERE'S A NEED TO CONTINUE TO HAVE DIALOGUE AS WE MAKE OUR WAY THROUGH IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE BILLS AND SO I THINK THIS CREATES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO ALL BE INFORMED- DOCTOR PAN- AS YOU POINTED OUT. TO REALLY AWESOME PENETRATING QUESTIONS IN TERMS OF HOW- EQUITY IS ALSO ADDRESSED IN THIS CONVERSATION OF DIVERSITY AND I THINK THIS GIVES US AN OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY. TO REALLY ENGAGE IN A MEANINGFUL WAY- WILL ALL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO ASK QUESTIONS AFTER EACH PANEL- AND THEN AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE PANELS WILL OPEN IT UP. FOR THE PUBLIC COMMENT- ONE QUICK NOTE BEFORE WE BEGIN TODAY. SB TWENTY SIX AND AB NINE SEVEN NINE OR BOTH- SUBJECT TO PENDING LITIGATION- THAT IS NOT THE TOPIC OF TODAY'S HEARING AS THIS IS AN INFORMATIONAL HEARING.

JERRY BROWN IN SEPTEMBER TWENTY EIGHTEEN. SINCE TWENTY NINETEEN WHEN WOMEN ON BOARD AFFECT THE SECRETARY OF STATE'S OFFICE HAS BEEN WORKING ON COMPILING DATA ABOUT BOARD DEMOGRAPHICS. THAT WERE NOT PREVIOUSLY COLLECTED BY OUR OFFICE OR ANY OTHER STATE AGENCY. DURING THEIR INITIAL YEARS OF DIVERSITY ON BOARDS IMPLEMENTATION OUR AGENCY IS FOCUSED ON EDUCATING BUSINESSES ABOUT CORPORATE DISCLOSURE STATEMENTS AND DIVERSITY ON BOARDS REQUIREMENTS RATHER THAN REGULATION AND PENALIZE ATION. IN DECEMBER TWENTY NINETEEN IN DECEMBER TWENTY TWENTY THE SECRETARY OF STATE'S OFFICE MAILED INFORMATIONAL LETTERS TO OVER TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED POTENTIAL CORPORATIONS IDENTIFIED THROUGH SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION.

OKAY ASSEMBLYMEMBER HOLDEN ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA COURT CHAIRS OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON CORPORATE CORPORATE BOARD IN CALIFORNIA WORKFORCE DIVERSITY. AND DISTINGUISHED MEMBERS JOINING THE SELECT COMMITTEE TODAY THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME. TO BE PART OF THIS IMPORTANT CONVERSATION FIRST OFF MY NAME IS ESTRELLA I GREW UP IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THE CITY OF SAN FERNANDO. AND AFTER I'M THE DAUGHTER OF A LANDSCAPE LABOR AND A GARMENT WORKER. AFTER GRADUATING FROM OCCIDENTAL COLLEGE I AM MOVED TO WASHINGTON DC TO IMPACT PUBLIC POLICY. MY PERSONAL AND PROFESSIONAL PURSUITS I'M BEEN TO ELEVATE LATINOS TO POSITIONS OF POWER- BOB AND TAKE OUR SEAT AT THE TABLE BECAUSE WE ARE BY ANY MEASURE THE LEAST REPRESENTED- ON BOARDS AND VERY INFLUENTIAL POSITIONS. SO ARE ASSOCIATION I CURRENTLY SERVE AS CEO OF THE CONGRESSIONAL SERVICIOS THE LATINO CORPORATE DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT OUR WORK IN MONITORING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF BOTH S. B. EIGHT TWENTY SIX AND A. B. NINE SEVEN NINE. FIRST OUT WE BEGAN MONITORING IMPLEMENTATION OF SB EIGHT TWENTY SIX AND WE PUBLISH THE FIRST STUDY OUT FIFTEEN MONTHS AFTER PASSAGE OF. EIGHT TWENTY SIX OUGHT TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE WOMEN. AND THE COMPOSITION OF WOMEN THAT WERE BEING APPOINTED TO CALIFORNIA COMPANY BOARDS AND THE FIRST ANY FOUND THAT OF THE FIVE HUNDRED ELEVEN APPOINTMENTS MADE. AFTER FIFTEEN MONTHS. 78% OF THE APPOINTMENTS WERE WHITE WOMEN. AND ONLY 3% LATINAS AGAIN THESE WERE NEW APPOINTMENTS MADE AFTER PASSAGE OF THAT BILL. WE CONTINUED OUR RESEARCH BECAUSE CLEARLY IT'S IMPORTANT TO OUR ADD WOMEN TO THE BOARD. BUT WE ALSO FOUND THAT BECAUSE THEY WERE- MAINLY WHITE WOMEN THAT A LOT OF THE BOARDS IN CALIFORNIA REMAINED ALL WHITE AND IN JULY ONE TWENTY TWENTY THREE PUBLISHED ANOTHER STUDY. ARE OF THE SIX HUNDRED AND SIXTY TWO PUBLIC COMPANIES IN CALIFORNIA. THIRTY TWO HUNDRED THIRTY THREE WERE ALL WHITE THAT IS 35% OF THE CALIFORNIA COMPANIES OUT WE WERE VERY PLEASED TO LEARN AT THAT TIME THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER HOLDEN AND OTHERS WERE LOOKING AT. INTRODUCING. EIGHTY NINE SEVEN NINE FIRST BOTH OF THESE LAWS HAVE BEEN GROUNDBREAKING AND CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN TRENDSETTING IN THE INTRODUCTION OF BOTH BILLS- WE HAVE FOUND THAT SINCE INTRODUCING NINE SEVEN NINE WE ARE SEEING A BIT MORE WOMEN OF COLOR ADDED TO BOARD SO IT HAS BEEN A TREMENDOUS UP ASSET AND INFLUENCE. I'M GONNA GO TO SOME SLIDES AND PRESENT YOU WITH. OUR LATEST FINDINGS. THIS IS FROM OUR. MORGAN REPORTS SO WHEN EIGHTY NINE SEVEN NINE WAS INTRODUCED WE ARE PRODUCING REPORTS EVERY QUARTER TO MONITOR- HOW THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE BILL IS GOING HOW COMPANIES ARE COMPLYING AND WHO IS BEING APPOINTED TO CALIFORNIA BOARDS AND IN THIS FIRST SLIDE YOU WILL SEE THE- BOASTS THAT DEMOGRAPHICS OF CALIFORNIA'S OP POPULATION YOU CAN GO TO THE PREVIOUS SLIDE PLEASE THANK YOU THIS IS PERFECT SO IN THIS SLIDE YOU'RE SEEING THE COMPOSITION OF PUBLICLY TRADED COMPANIES BY GENDER RACE AND ETHNICITY. AND THIS IS ADDS- Q. TWO OF. TWENTY TWENTY ONE. SO WHAT YOU SEE HERE IS FIRST LATINOS ARE THE LARGEST SEGMENT OF CALIFORNIA'S POPULATION WITH THIRTY NINE POINT 4% THIS IS THE LATEST TWENTY TWENTY DATA YET WE'RE THE LARGEST DEMOGRAPHIC LARGER THAN ARE WHITES WHITES REPRESENT I NEARLY 35% ASIANS ARE NEARLY 16% AND- BLACKS ARE UP FIVE POINT 5% BOTTOM LINE IS THAT THE BOARD COMPOSITION OF CALIFORNIA COMPANIES DO NOT REFLECT ITS DEMOGRAPHIC AND ITS STRENGTH OF ITS- POPULATION IN TERMS OF BOARD APPOINTMENTS. LATINOS ARE UNDER REPRESENTED BY ANY MEASURE OF THOSE SERVING ON BOARDS. AS OF Q. TWO OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE ONLY TWO POINT 5% OF ALL BOARD SEATS OF CALIFORNIA PUBLIC COMPANY BOARDS ARE HELD BY LATINOS. BOB WHITES CONTINUE TO HOLD THE LION'S SHARE OF BOARD SEATS AT SEATS AND BLACKS ARE FOUR POINT WOMEN ARE THE PERCENTAGE OF FEMALE SEATS HERE AGAIN LATINOS ARE THE LEAST REPRESENTED EVEN THOUGH. THEY ARE 20% OF ALL PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA A HOLD ON THE ONE POINT 1% OF ALL CALIFORNIA COMPANY SEATS AND I ASK MYSELF HOW DOES THIS HAPPEN IN TWENTY FIRST CENTURY CALIFORNIA TWENTY FIRST CENTURY AMERICA. SO WE ABSOLUTELY WANT TO SEE SOME CHANGE WE CAN GO TO THAT THE NEXT SLIDE. SO IN ADDITION TO LOOKING AT THE ENTIRE COMPOSITION OF WHO'S ON CALIFORNIA COMPANY BOARDS WERE ALSO MONITORING NEW APPOINTMENTS. SO THESE TWO GRAPHS SHOW YOU THAT NEW APPOINTMENTS MADE TO CALIFORNIA BOARDS BETWEEN JULY ONE. AND TWENTY TWENTY AND JUNE THIRTIETH TWENTY TWENTY ONE THERE WERE A TOTAL OF ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED FORTY THREE OINTMENTS MADE DURING THAT PERIOD. OF THESE NEW APPOINTMENTS. 70% 69% OR NINE HUNDRED NINETY NINE OF THOSE APPOINTMENTS ARE. WERE SEIZED BY WHITES THE SECOND LARGEST SEGMENT TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY FIVE SEATS OR 18% OF THOSE NEW APPOINTMENTS IN THAT PERIOD OF WERE SEIZED BY ASIAN AMERICANS ARE LACKS SEES 10% OF THE SEATS A HUNDRED FORTY. AND LATINOS WERE ONLY TAPPED FOR FORTY NINE SEATS OR THREE POINT 5% THIS BOTTOM PORTION OF YOUR ODDS SLIDE HERE THE SLIDE LOOKS AT. THE GENDER BREAKDOWN. FOUR THE GENDER BREAKDOWN OVER ALL OF THE APPOINTMENTS MADE BETWEEN THIS PERIOD. 60% R. WHERE ERE ASSIGNED TO MEN. WERE APPOINTED AT TO WHITES THAT'S UP NUMBER IS. IT'S SEVENTY IS 63% OF THAT TOTAL. ASIANS GARNERED HUNDRED TEN SEATS OR 19% AND BLACKS GARDNER 13% OF THE SEATS LATINOS LIKE DENIES IN THIS CASE- GAINED 5% AGAIN OF THE WOMEN OF THE APPOINTMENTS MADE TO TWO WOMEN- I WILL MAKE A NOTE AND COMPARING OUR FIRST DATA. WITH WHERE WE ARE TO DATE WHEN WE FIRST MEASURED. WHO ARE THE WOMEN THE COMPOSITION OF WOMEN GETTING ON BOARD- BACK IN MARCH TWENTY TWENTY BOB WHITE WOMEN AGAIN OR 70% OF THE SEATS IT WENT DOWN TO SIXTY THREE PERCENT. IT'S STILL ARE LARGER THAN THEIR SHARE OF THE POPULATION SO WAS THAT A NEGATIVE FIFTEEN. OP AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMEN ARE WENT FROM WITH AN INCREASE OF PLUS 8% OF OUR BLACK WOMEN GETTING ON BOARDS OB AND FOR I'M SORRY THAT WAS ASIAN WOMEN ASIAN WOMEN GAINED AT EIGHT PERCENT. OUT BLACK WOMEN WERE 5% OF BOARD SEES BEFORE THIS LAW AFTER THE LAW. OUT THERE ARE HAVE SEEN WOMEN OF COLOR INCREASE FOR LATINOS. BEFORE THE LAW. FOUR SEVEN NINE SEVEN NINE OUT. THERE WERE THE CARD OR 3% OF SEATS AFTER NINE SEVEN NINE THEY GARNERED 5% OF SEATS ON INCREASE OF TWO PERCENT. AGAIN LATINAS AND LATINOS BY ANY MEASURE ARE STILL AT LEAST REPRESENTED OF ANY DEMOGRAPHIC GROUP AND WE HAVE THE WIDEST GAP TO CLOSE COMPARED TO OUR SCIENCE IN THE STATE'S POPULATION. WE GOT TO THE NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. THIS A SLIGHT GIVES YOU SOME TREND DATA. OF THE DIFFERENT QUARTERS WHERE WE ARE MEASURING APPOINTMENTS THE NEW APPOINTMENTS THE PURPLE SHOWS YOU THAT APPOINTMENTS MADE BETWEEN JULY ONE IN DECEMBER THIRTY ONE. AT THE NEXT THAT TIAN IS OUR Q. ONE TWENTY TWENTY ONE DATA AND THE GREAT IS. UP Q. TO THE LATEST DATA SO YOU SEE HERE BOB WHAT THE TRENDS HAVE BEEN FOUR WHITE ASIAN BLACK AND LATINOS- IN TERMS OF CORNERING SEATS. WE SEE CLEAR. STRONG NUMBERS FOR WHITE FOR WHITES OVER ALL ASIANS IN THE LAST QUARTER INCREASED THERE ARE APPOINTMENTS SIGNIFICANTLY- SOME FOR BLACKS AND LATINOS CONTINUE TO HAVE A VERY LOW NUMBER OF APPOINTMENTS I'M IN THE PROCESS NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. THIS IS A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND ON THE METHODOLOGY AT THE TIME OF THEIR QUEUE TO REPORTS THERE ARE SEVEN HUNDRED NINE PUBLIC COMPANIES HEADQUARTERED IN CALIFORNIA. THAT WAS A TOTAL OF FIVE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED AND THIRTY ONE SEATS. STILL TODAY NEARLY 23% OF CALIFORNIA COMPANY OUR BOARD SEATS ARE ALL WHITE THEY DON'T INCLUDE RACE ARE RACIAL OR ETHNIC INDIVIDUAL ON THE SEATS THEY MAY INCLUDE WHITE WOMEN BUT WE STILL HAVE A WAYS TO GO FOR CALIFORNIA COMPANIES TO OP AD REYES AND ETHNICITY- EIGHTY TWO POINT 7% OF CALIFORNIA COMPANIES. VAST MAJORITY DO NOT HAVE A SINGLE LATINO OR LATINA ON THE BOARD. WITH THIS JOB MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND- THE AUDIENCE- WE HAVE A MADE SOME PROGRESS THAT BILL NINE SEVEN NINE HELPED TO INCREASE SOME DIVERSITY FOR WOMEN OF COLOR ON THE BOARDS BUT THERE STILL REMAINS A GREAT DEAL OF BARRIERS FOR ODD LATINAS AND LATINOS IN CALIFORNIA WE ALSO MEASURE. ALL THE U. S. DEMOGRAPHICS OF LATINOS ON BOARDS AND CALIFORNIA- IS AT THE TOP OF THE LEAST WITH THE LEAST NUMBER AND PERCENTAGE OF LATINOS OF ANY OTHER STATE IN THE COUNTRY WE ARE AS THE LATINO CORPORATE DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION WE PERFORMED BY LATINO DIRECTORS. BECAUSE THE NUMBERS ARE LOW AND WE KEPT HEARING EXCUSES THAT YOU CAN FIND THEM I WILL TELL YOU THAT THERE IS AMPLE TALENT FOR THE BOARDROOM OUR MEMBERSHIP IS INCREASING THREEFOLD- ALMOST ON AN ANNUAL BASIS AND SO REALLY THERE IS NO EXCUSE FOR CONTINUES TO BE. A STRUCTURAL RACISM ALL. FOR LATINOS IN THE PIPELINE IN THE C. SUITE AND THE BOARDROOM AND IN EVERY SECTOR OF THE COUNTRY. LATINOS ARE NATIONWIDE. R. TWO IN TEN AMERICANS WE CONTRIBUTE OUR MARKET SHARE IS INCREASING AND WE CONTRIBUTE 72% OF NEW ENTRANTS TO THE WORK FORCE INVESTING IN PROMOTING LATINOS FOR POSITIONS OF LEADERSHIP AND POWER WILL ONLY HELP THE ECONOMY AND THE STATE. I THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT OUR DATA. THANK YOU ESTHER ARM HI I THINK WHEN I WHEN WE STARTED THIS I WOULD SAY THAT WE WOULD HAVE- QUESTIONS AT THE END OF THE PANEL- SO. JANET LONG IF YOU COULD GIVE US JUST A MOMENT AND WE WILL COME TO YOU AND INTRODUCE YOU UNLESS. THERE ARE QUESTIONS THAT WANT TO BE HELD WHERE WE'RE AT. WE'LL DO IT TOGETHER OKAY- ASSISTED US TO RAISE A LOT OF INTERESTING. THE ISSUES THAT I THINK WERE CAPTURED US IN THE MOMENT BUT WILL HOLD AND I WILL NOW INTRODUCE. OUR NEXT PRESENTER- JANET S. HUANG FROM THE DIVERSE CORPORATE DIRECTORS COALITION. AND WOMEN CORPORATE DIRECTORS AS LONG AS AN INDEPENDENT BOARD DIRECTOR. FOR PUBLICLY LISTED COMPANIES INCLUDING TWO HEADED HEADQUARTERED IN THE SILICON VALLEY. SHE IS A LONGTIME VOLUNTEER AND ADVOCATE FOR WORKPLACE DIVERSITY ESPECIALLY IN THE CORPORATE BOARD ROOM. SHE REPRESENTS THE PAN ASIAN COMMUNITY ON THE DIVERSE CORPORATE DIRECTORS COALITION SHE IS A MEMBER OF THE WOMEN'S CORPORATE DIRECTORS AND VOLUNTEERS AS AN EXECUTIVE ADVISOR TO ASCEND THE LARGEST ASIAN PERSON PROFESSIONAL BUSINESS ORGANIZATION IN NORTH AMERICA. DURING HER TIME MEDICINE SHE SERVED AS A LEADER OF A SEN PENTACLE IT'S NETWORK OF EXPERIENCED AND ASPIRING CORPORATE BOARD DIRECTORS. SHE ALSO SERVED ON THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE 30% COALITION WORKING TO INCREASE DIVERSITY IN CORPORATE BOARD ROOMS ACROSS THE U. S. LIKE TO THANK YOU MS ONE FOR JOINING US TODAY. WE APPRECIATE YOU BEING A PART OF THIS CONVERSATION AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR PRESENTATION. THANK YOU. FIRST I WOULD LIKE TO EXPRESS MY APPRECIATION TO ASSEMBLY MEMBERS HOLDEN AND GARCIA TWO OF THE KEY SPONSORS OF AB NINE SEVEN NINE AND CO CHAIRS OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE AS WELL AS OTHER- COMMITTEE MEMBERS THAT ARE HERE TODAY FOR INVITING ME TO SPEAK ON HOW THE LEGISLATURE CAN IMPROVE ON CORPORATE BOARD DIVERSITY IN CALIFORNIA. IT'S A GREAT PRIVILEGE AND A PLEASURE TO PARTICIPATE ON THIS PANEL WITH MR ERIK GAS AND WITH ESTHER AG ALERA ESTHER IS NOT ONLY A CO ADVOCATE OF CORPORATE BOARD DIVERSITY BUT ALSO A FRIEND. OF SO I MET IN THE UNIQUE POSITION AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER HOLDEN SAID WHERE I AM A CORPORATE BOARD DIRECTOR CURRENTLY SERVING ON THE BOARDS UP FOR PUBLIC COMPANIES INCLUDING TWO WITH HEADQUARTERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I WANT TO TAKE A MINUTE JUST TO SHARE THE DIVERSITY OF BOTH OF THESE COMPANIES WORK FORCE IN THE BOARD ROOM BECAUSE THEY ARE GREAT EXAMPLES OF BOTH SB EIGHT TWENTY SIX AND AB NINE SEVEN NINE. SO WE CAN PUT UP THE FIRST SLIDE- LAST SEPTEMBER I WAS ELECTED TO. THE BOARD OF LUMENTUM. A TECHNOLOGY THAT CAN GO THE NEXT SLIDE THANK YOU. A TECHNOLOGY MANUFACTURER THAT'S HEADQUARTERED IN SAN JOSE I STRONGLY MET THEIR SKILLS MATRIX FOR THIS NEW BOARD SEAT. AND I'LL IT ALSO ENABLED MOMENTUM TO ME SB EIGHT TWENTY SIX AS AT THE TIME THEY HAD TWO WOMEN. BOARD DIRECTORS BUT WANTED TO ADD A THIRD WOMAN MEMBER AND THEY ALSO WANTED O ADD SOME RACIAL DIVERSITY TO REFLECT THEIR EMPLOYEE WORK FORCE. OF THE COMPANY AND AS YOU CAN SEE FROM THIS GRAPHIC THIS IS. ACTUALLY THE WORK FORCE TODAY R. AS OF AUGUST THIRTY ONE IN CALIFORNIA AND IT SHOWS THAT OVER 60% OF THE WORK FORCE IS ASIAN. OUR RECENTLY LUMENTUM ADDED A SUPPLY CHAIN EXPERT TO ITS BOARD WITH THE WELL QUALIFIED DIRECTORS WHO IS AFRICAN AMERICAN SO NOW THE BOARD CONSISTS OF. EIGHT IN TOTAL WITH THREE WOMEN- ONE WOMAN OF COLOR AND A MALE OF PERSON THE COLOR. SO IF WE CAN GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE. THIS IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE LUCID IS AN ELECTRIC VEHICLE MANUFACTURER ALSO HEADQUARTERED IN SILICON VALLEY I JUST RECENTLY OF WAS DISTINGUISHED TO BE THE FIRST ELECTRIC CAR TO RECEIVE A FIVE HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILE EPA RATED RANGE ON A SINGLE CHARGE. I JOINED ITS BOARD OF THIS PAST JULY WHEN THE COMPANY BECAME PUBLICLY LISTED ON THE NASDAQ AND FROM THE GRAPH IN THE UPPER RIGHT HAND CORNER YOU CAN SEE THAT LUCID IS A FAST GROWING COMPANY IN CALIFORNIA IN YEAR TO DATE HAS ADDED OVER SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY JOBS IN THE STATE. L'USAGE TRULY HAS ITS HEART IN CALIFORNIA WITH NOT ONLY ITS HEADQUARTERS HERE BUT ALSO FOR FIVE RETAIL SHOW ROOMS SO FAR IN THE STATE. AND WHERE IT'S INTERIOR CAR DESIGNS I REALLY LIKE THIS OUR NAME WITH CALIFORNIA THEMES SUCH AS SANTA MONICA IN TAHOE. IT CURRENTLY HAS A BOARD OF NINE DIRECTORS WHICH INCLUDES THREE WOMEN OF WHICH TWO ARE WOMEN OF COLOR. AN ASIAN AND AN AFRICAN AMERICAN. AS YOU CAN TELL I'M VERY ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT BOTH OF THESE COMPANIES AS THEY NOT ONLY HAVE AND SUPPORT A DIVERSE BOARD OF DIRECTORS. THESE COMPANIES ARE BUILDING THE FUTURE OF DIVERSE LEADERS THROUGH THE DIVERSITY OF THE EMPLOYEE WORK FORCE AND PROGRAMS TO SUPPORT LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT. IF WE CAN GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE. UP ESTHER HAVE PROVIDED A GREAT UPDATE ON THE IMPACT TO THE NUMBER OF WOMEN ON CALIFORNIA BOARDS- THAT ARE HEADQUARTERED HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AS WELL AS THE NUMBER OF PORTS SEATS HELD BY. OTHER UNDERREPRESENTED GROUPS I'M NOT GOING TO GO THROUGH THE NUMBERS- AND NO SHE POINTED OUT HOW LOW THE LATINO- OF. REPRESENTATION IS ON BOARDS AGAIN ASIANS ARE ALSO DOWN AT THE AT THE LOW PERCENTAGES OF THAT GROUP AS WELL. SO IN STATE OF FOCUSING MORE ON THE NUMBERS I WANTED TO SHARE SOME THOUGHTS ON HOW. WE AND THE LEGISLATURE COULD FURTHER IMPROVE ON THE STATISTICS OF BOARD DIVERSITY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND BEYOND. SO ON THIS SLIDE JUST WANTED TO MOVE. UP THIS EMPHASIZED THE IMPORTANCE OF BOARD DIVERSITY DISCLOSURE. IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN THE DIVERSE CORPORATE CORRECTORS COALITION OF WHICH THAT LATINO CORPORATE DIRECTORS IS ALSO A MEMBER RELEASED A CALL TO ACTION FOR GREATER BOARD DIVERSITY. AND ONE OF THE KEY RECOMMENDATIONS IN THIS CALL TO ACTION WAS FOR COMPANIES ESPECIALLY PUBLIC COMPANIES TO REPORT OR DISCLOSE INFORMATION ON THE MAKE UP OF THEIR BOARD OF DIRECTORS SO IN EFFECT A CALL FOR TRANSPARENCY. ARE THOUGHT AT THE TIME AND STILL TODAY IS WHAT GETS MEASURED GETS DONE YOU KNOW WE CAN SEE THAT WITH OF THE NUMBERS THAT ESTHER WENT THROUGH THAT. THERE HAS BEEN SOME MOVEMENT WITH BOTH OF THE CALIFORNIA LAWS BUT OBVIOUSLY MORE BRING- TO IMPROVE ON BOARD DIVERSITY. RECENTLY KPMG BOARD LEADERSHIP CENTER WHO SUPPORTS THE DC DC RELEASED TOOLS TO HELP COMPANIES DISCLOSE THEIR BOARD COMPOSITION INFORMATION AND YOU CAN FIND THAT ON THEIR WEBSITE. ALL WE HAVE SCENES DAY COLDER CALLS CONTINUE TO GROW OR DISCLOSURE OF BOARD DIVERSITY HOWEVER DISCLOSURE PRACTICES ARE NOT CONSISTENT ACROSS COMPANIES FOR EXAMPLE SOME COMPANIES REPORT ONLY THE AGGREGATE NUMBER OR PERCENTAGE OF DIVERSE BOARD MEMBERS AND COMPANIES HAVE BEEN LESS LIKELY TO REPORT THE DIVERSITY OF INDIVIDUAL BOARD MEMBERS SO WE CAN GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE. WE BELIEVE WITH MORE DETAILED DISCLOSURE ABOUT BOARD DIVERSITY IT WILL PROVIDE TRANSPARENCY AND HELP US UNDERSTAND WHAT EACH DIRECTOR BRINGS TO THE BOARD ROOM TABLE. I MENTIONED EARLIER ABOUT THE DC DC CALL TO ACTION AND THE EXAMPLES IN THAT CALL TO ACTION IT ALSO PROVIDES A TEMPLATE FOR COMPANIES TO DISCLOSE THEIR DIVERSITY INFORMATION SO WE'RE SEEING A LOT MORE TOOLS TO HELP. COMPANIES DISCLOSE THEIR BOARD DATA. IF WE GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE. SLIDE IS A GRAPHIC REFLECTING THAT LARGER COMPANIES IN THE S. AND P. FIVE HUNDRED INDEX ARE MORE LIKELY TO PROVIDE DIVERSITY DISCLOSURE INFORMATION THEN COMPANIES IN THE BROADER RUSSELL THREE THOUSAND INDEX SO NEARLY THREE QUARTERS OR 71% OF S. AND P. FIVE HUNDRED COMPANIES. BOB DISCLOSE THEIR RACIAL AND DIVERSITY MAKE UP COMPARED TO ONLY A THIRD OR 34% OF THE RUSSELL THREE THOUSAND. INDEX SOME COMPANIES ARE ACTUALLY PROVIDING BOTH AGGREGATE AND INDIVIDUAL INFORMATION HOWEVER THE NUMBER OF COMPANIES AND THE PERCENTAGE ARE NOT AS LARGE FOR EXAMPLE 19% OF COMPANIES IN THE S. AND P. FIVE HUNDRED ARE PROVIDING BOTH THE AGGREGATE AND INDIVIDUAL BOARD INFORMATION AND ONLY 5% OF THE RUSSELL THREE THOUSAND ARE PROVIDING THIS INFORMATION. SO WE GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE. BOB THIS JUST GIVE SOME FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THE AGGREGATE DISCLOSURE WHICH AGAIN IS LESS INFORMATION UP IT IS INCREASING SOAK UP BOARDS ARE COMPANIES ARE PROVIDING THAT INFORMATION ON THEIR BOARDS. OF IN FACT THE NUMBER OF COMPANIES IS MORE THAN DOUBLE FROM JANUARY TO JULY OF TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE SO AGAIN HOPEFULLY WE WILL SEE THAT TREND CONTINUE TO GET BETTER. IF WE GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE. THIS REFLECTS COMPANIES THAT ARE PROVIDING INDIVIDUAL DIVERSITY DISCLOSURE WHICH AGAIN PROVIDES MORE DATA MORE INFORMATION. OF THE PERCENTAGE OF COMPANIES THAT ARE PROVIDING THE INDIVIDUAL RACIAL AND ETHNIC DIVERSITY DATA HAS ALSO INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY DURING THE SAME TIMEFRAME JANUARY TO JULY TWENTY TWENTY ONE. IN FACT IT'S MORE THAN DOUBLED FROM JANUARY WHEN IT WAS 16% TO JULY OF THIS YEAR WHERE IT'S NOW THIRTY FOUR PERCENT. IF YOU LOOK AT THE RUSSELL THREE THOUSAND COMPANIES DISCLOSING INDIVIDUAL DIRECTOR DATA THE NUMBERS TRIPLE HOWEVER IT STARTED WITH A SMALLER NUMBER IN JANUARY AT 5% AND NOW IT'S THOUSAND. THAT ARE DISCLOSING THE INDIVIDUAL DATA. SO WE CAN GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE- CAN WE BACK UP ONE SLIDE BACK TO THE OTHER ONE JUST WANT TO INDICATE THAT THERE IS GREATER SUPPORT FOR BOARD DIVERSITY DISCLOSURE INCLUDING NASDAQ'S BOARD DIVERSITY ROLE THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER HOLDEN MENTIONED IN HIS OPENING REMARKS THIS RULE WAS APPROVED BY THE SEC AND AUGUST pINCLUDES A DISCLOSURE STANDARD REQUIRING COMPANIES LISTED ON THE U. S. EXCHANGE TO PUBLICLY DISCLOSE THEIR BOARD LEVEL DIVERSITY STATISTICS. AND THE HAVE OR EXPLAIN WHY THEY DO NOT HAVE AT LEAST TWO DIVERSE CORRECTORS ON THEIR PORCH IN IN ON THE NASDAQ'S WEBSITE THEY ALSO PROVIDE AN EXAMPLE OF A GOOD DIVERSITY DISCLOSURE SO I'VE MENTIONED THREE NOW THAT DC DC KPMG'S BOARD LEADERSHIP CENTER AND NASDAQ THAT ALL HAVE EXAMPLES. FOR DISCLOSING MORE DIVERSITY DATA. IF WE CAN GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE. THIS IS MY- LAST SLIDE AND WHAT I'M REFLECTING HERE IS AN EXAMPLE OF INDIVIDUAL- DIRECTOR DIVERSITY DATA. AND THIS IS FOR LUMENTUM THE COMPANY THAT I SERVE ON ITS BOARD AGAIN IT'S A MID CAP COMPANY. THIS IS IN THEIR PROXY THERE- SHAREHOLDER MEETING IS COMING UP IN NOVEMBER SO THIS IS JUST RECENTLY RELEASED DATA BUT THERE ARE DISCLOSURE NOT ONLY SHOWS A SKILLS MATRIX X. FOR EACH DIRECTOR ON THE BOARD. BUT IT ALSO SHOWS WITH AT THE VERY BOTTOM OF THE PAGE THAT DIVERSITY- GENDER RACIAL MAKE UP OF EACH DIRECTOR SO AS I MENTIONED BEFORE THERE ARE THREE WOMEN- ONE WOMAN OF COLOR MYSELF AND ONE OF MALE. SAY AFRICAN AMERICAN. SO I THINK THAT THIS REPRESENTS A GOOD EXAMPLE AND I JUST WANTED TO BOB DEMONSTRATE THAT THERE ARE OTHER- STATE OTHER ENTITIES NOT JUST STATE A CALIFORNIA STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS DEFINITELY BEEN A LEADER. IN BOARD DIVERSITY- WE CAN SEE NASDAQ TAKING A LEAD THERE IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN THE STATE OF ILLINOIS I HAD A NEW LAW REQUIRING COMPANIES WITH THEIR EXECUTIVE OFFICES IN THE STATE OF ILLINOIS TO DISCLOSE THE MAKE UP OF THEIR CORPORATE BOARDS- THE SEC IS ALSO CONSIDERING DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS. THERE'S A LARGE FOCUS FOR COMPANIES TO- REPORT AND PROVIDE ESG INFORMATION AND THAT SORT OF PART OF THAT YES IN THE ESD. OF THERE'S A FOCUS NOW ABOUT DISCLOSURE OF BOARD INFORMATION I THINK THE KEY WILL BE. THAT DUMB IF WILL GET CONSISTENCY IN THE INFORMATION REPORTED SO I DEFINITELY THINK THERE IS A MOVEMENT IN GREATER BOARD OF. DISCLOSURE IN SUMMARY THE DIVERSE CORPORATE DIRECTORS COALITION AS WELL AS OTHER SUPPORTING ORGANIZATIONS YOU KNOW RECOMMENDS THAT THE SELECT COMMITTEE AND THE EGISLATORS LEGISLATURES SUPPORT INDIVIDUAL BOARD DIRECTOR DIVERSITIES DISCLOSURE ESPECIALLY FOR COMPANIES HEADQUARTERED IN CALIFORNIA. OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS ALREADY BEEN A LEADER IN CORPORATE BOARD DIVERSITY AND I THANK YOU FOR CONTINUING TO BE AT THE FOREFRONT. SO THAT CONCLUDES MY FORMAL REMARKS AND I LOOKED FOR CHEAP QUICK QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS. THANK YOU AS LONG WAS- APPRECIATED PRESENTATION VERY THOROUGH I WILL TURN TO COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR ANY QUESTION I KNOW THAT- OF VICE VERSA COCHAIR OF GARCIA HAS A FEW QUESTIONS AND I'LL AND THEN DOCTOR DOCTOR PAN. I THINK IN IN THE QUESTIONS FOR BOTH OF YOU WELL FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION AND THE DATA OFFER A HELPFUL EARLIER- MAKING MISS HUANG SAID THAT WILL GETS MEASURED. GETS DONE- AND I THINK I WONDER. I'D ADD TO THAT WE'LL GET MEASURED PUBLICLY. GETS DONE AND HE GAVE HIS ONE RECOMMENDATION AT THE END OF YOUR PRESENTATION- TO DO THE INDIVIDUAL BOARD OF DIRECTORS DIVERSITY INFORMATION PUBLICLY. OUT THERE TO HELP MOVE THE BALL FORWARD- WHEN WE WERE HAVING THE DISCUSSIONS AROUND AB NINE SEVEN THE NINE THE DISCUSSION OF EQUITY SOMETHING THAT MR HOLDEN AND I KEPT GOING BACK AND FORTH ON AND WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT AS WE SIGN PRUDENT THAT WE SIDE EQUITABLY ACROSS ALL. MARGINALIZED GROUPS AND NOT JUST ONE GROUP OR THE OR THE VERSUS ANOTHER OUT THERE AND AT THE DATA THAT AS A PRESENTED TO US LET'S NOT THAT THAT CONCERN IS REAL AND WE NEED TO FIND WAYS TO ADDRESS THAT EQUITY ISSUE. SO IN ADDITION TO INDIVIDUAL BOARD OF DIRECTORS EVERSON INFORMATION THAT YOU RECOMMEND THAT YOURSELF OR MISS AND LARA I HAVE ADDITIONAL POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WILL HELP US GET TO A MORE EQUITABLE- SITUATION AS A AS A LATINA. AND AS THE CHAIR OF THE WOMEN'S CAUCUS- YOU KNOW I TAKE A BRIEF MOMENT TO BE THANKFUL FOR THE PROGRESS WE'VE MADE BUT I THINK FOR THE MOST PART STILL PRETTY ALARMED AFFORDABLE OF WHERE WE'RE AT AND HOW SLOW THE CHANGES HAPPENING FOR. THESE COMMUNITY GROUPS AND SO I DO LIKE- ADDITIONAL IDEAS THAT YOU THINK WE NEED TO DO TO. TO CREATE MORE EQUITY IN IN THESE NUMBERS. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY WOMAN GARCIA I'M HAPPY TO HAVE START I'M SURE JANET BALL TRYING MAN. JANET IS THAT AN ESTEEMED COLLEAGUE AND I'M ONE OF THE CO FOUNDERS OF. THAT DIVERSE CORPORATE DIRECTORS COALITION. THAT INCLUDES. THE BLACK DIRECTORS CONFERENCE THAT SAID TENTACLE AB AND WHEN CORPORATE DIRECTORS- ASCEND. PINNACLE AND THE OUT QUORUM WHICH IS THE L. G. B. T. Q. DIRECTORS- PART OF WHAT JANET MENTIONED IS THE IMPORTANCE OF DISCLOSURE. WE HAVE TO DO A LOT OF INDIVIDUAL- MEASURING COMPANIES TO COME UP WITH OUR DATA SO THE DISCLOSURE REALLY WOULD. MAKE IT A LOT MORE PUBLIC AND I WHICH STRONGLY URGE- TO DISAGGREGATE THE DATA OUT. I THINK SOMETIMES COMBINING DIVERSITY DATA OR PEOPLE OF COLOR DATA DOES NOT GET. TO THE INDIVIDUAL MEASURES THAT WE NEED. SO DISAGGREGATE. BY LATINO ASIAN AND BLACK WOMEN AND EVEN FOR THE NUMBER OF WOMEN SOMETIMES WILL GIVE HERE'S HOW WOMEN ARE DOING BUT WE ALSO NEED TO DISAGGREGATE. ARM THE NUMBER OF WOMEN AS WELL BECAUSE AND WE HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING HOW WE'RE DOING BOTH. IN THE GENERAL POPULATION FOR ALL. AND HOW WE'RE DOING FOR WOMEN OF COLOR THOSE ARE A COUPLE OF RECOMMENDATIONS BUT I COMPLETELY AGREE AND- CONCUR WITH THE. ACCIDENT REPORT THAT JANET GAVE. THANK YOU ESTHER MAYBE I CAN JUST ADD A LITTLE BIT ON TO THAT ALL BECAUSE YEAH I AM A FIRM BELIEVER YEAH WHAT GETS MEASURED GETS DONE SO TO THE EXTENT PEOPLE- SEE THOSE STATISTICS ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU GET EXAMPLES OF. LIKE IN THE STATE OF BOTH THE LATINO AND ASIAN COMMUNITY ARE VERY LARGE POPULATION WITHIN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BUT HOLD VERY SMALL PERCENTAGES OF THE BOARD SEAT SO I THINK THAT DISCLOSURE HELPS. I THINK ANOTHER WAY THAT THIS CAN BE DONE- IS JUST THE AWARENESS AND BY HAVING THIS- FORUM TODAY. YOU KNOW THAT JUST HELPS DEMONSTRATE WE'RE GIVING AN UPDATE AND WE SHOW SOME PROGRESS BUT THERE'S STILL ROOM FOR MORE IMPROVEMENT SO JUST HAVING THE DISCUSSIONS AND BRINGING OUT THAT THERE IS THE ISSUE AND THE IMPORTANCE OF. THE GREATER BOARD DIVERSITY I THINK IT'S HELPFUL. THANK YOU DR PAN. THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATIONS I DO JUST WANT TO FIRST OF ALL BRIEFLY- KNOWLEDGE. A SECRETARY OF STATE AND ACTUALLY ERIC KARROS WAS MY FIRST LEDGE DIRECTOR SUMMER I'LL GET TO SEE HIM BACK- SO AGAIN APPRECIATE THE EFFORTS OF OUR SECRETARY OF STATE- TO- TRYING TO GATHER DATA AND MONITOR THIS DATA. AND SO I DO HAVE QUESTIONS FOR BOTH- MISS AG ALERA AND- AND IN THIS ONE AS WELL I THANK YOU BOTH FOR YOUR PRESENTATIONS- THAT STATE SO MUCH SO I GUESS MY FIRST QUESTION FOR THE SECULAR- IN IT AND I JUST WANT TO. AND I HEARD YOU SAY THIS BUT I JUST WANT AND PERHAPS HAVE YOU REPEAT THIS- I HEARD YOU SAY THAT CALIFORNIA IS A STATE. DESPITE OUR VERY LARGE LATINO POPULATION ACTUALLY HAS THE LOW IS THE LOWEST OF ANY STATES IN TERMS. OF CORPORATE BOARD REPRESENTATION FOR LATINOS. THAT HEAR THAT RIGHT. YES THAT IS CORRECT- AND I WOULD JUST I MEAN AS YOU KNOW THE CHANNELS ARE NOT ONLY A LARGE SEGMENT OF CALIFORNIA'S POPULATION WE ARE THE PLAN THE REALITY LARGER THAN ANY OTHER DEMOGRAPHIC. CALIFORNIA IS DISTINCT IN THAT WAY- IF YOU LOOK AT THE OVERALL CALIFORNIA STATISTICS LATINOS HOLD TWO POINT 5% OF THE CALIFORNIA BOARD SEATS NATIONWIDE THIS IS- NATIONWIDE IT'S CLOSER 23% AND SO UP NATIONWIDE WE ARE 20% OF THE POPULATION COMPARED TO FORTY SO IF WE WERE. TO MEASURE EQUITABLY. COMPARED TO THAT NATIONWIDE IT SHOULD BE CLOSER TO FOUR PERCENT- BUT WE DO HAVE DATA BROKEN OUT BY STATE IN TERMS OF HOW MANY BOARDS COMPANIES ARE IN CALIFORNIA AND HOW MANY HAVE. THAT YOU KNOW DIRECTORS AND CALIFORNIA MEASURE. OUR FIFTIETH IN TERMS OF. I WOULD SAY FIFTIETH IN TERMS. OF THE STATE THE LARGEST CALIPH LATINO POPULATION MAYBE NOT OUT OF ALL FIFTY OF THE TOP ALL STATES WITH LATINO POPULATION BUT TINA- CALIFORNIA IS AT THE BOTTOM OKAY ALL RIGHT. YOU SEE VERY TROUBLING STATISTIC BUT I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT AND HAVE YOU REPEAT THAT SURE I HEARD IT CORRECTLY- AND THEN I GUESS THE OTHER QUESTION ACTUALLY RELATED TO DATA COLLECTION AND I ALSO WILL HAVE A QUESTION FOR THIS ONE ABOUT THIS AS WELL. BUT JANUARY SO IN TERMS OF TRYING TO COLLECT THIS DATA GIVEN THE CHALLENGES THAT YOU TALKED ABOUT- WHAT ARE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT YOU THINK WE NEED TO DO SO THAT SO I GUESS SO I GUESS THE QUESTION I HAVE IS THAT. YOU KNOW HOW MUCH EFFORT IT TAKES TO COMPILE THIS INFORMATION AND WHAT SHOULD WE DO TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR GROUPS LIKE YOURSELF TO ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO- TO GET THIS INFORMATION AS WELL AS OF COURSE BEING ABLE TO. HOLD PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE RESULTS. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION. WELL WE TEAMED UP WITH AQUILO ARE WHICH IS BASED IN CALIFORNIA. AND DAVID CHIU ON IS THE CEO. AND IT'S A PLATFORM THAT TRACKS ALL DIRECTORS AND- SENIOR EXECUTIVES AND COLLECTS DATA THAT'S PUBLICLY AVAILABLE. AND IT'S A MASSIVE DATABASE AND WE STARTED. WORKING WITH THEM ALONG WITH OTHER. RACE ETHNIC GROUPS TO IDENTIFY WITH IN THE EKWALL OUR NETWORK. WHICH OUT DIRECTORS ARE IDENTIFIED AS LATINOS AND WHICH DON'T. AND WE HAVE A METHODOLOGY FOR DOING THAT WE DO RESEARCH- ON HOW THIS INDIVIDUAL HAS. NOT ONLY YOU KNOW WE DON'T ONLY LOOK AT THE NAME BUT ARE THEY A U. S. LATINO OR LATINA. VERSUS I'M SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T RESIDE IN THE COUNTRY NOT- REALLY CONNECTED WITH THE U. S. THAT YOU KNOW COMMUNITIES SO WE GOT TO THAT. STAFF TO COME UP WITH THESE NUMBERS- SO THAT IT IS A LOT OF WORK. OUT ONE- MODELS. THAT CALIFORNIA CAN LOOK AT. THERE IS LARGEST. THAT WAS INTRODUCED IN THE U. S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES IT ACTUALLY PASSED AT THE HOUSE AT THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES IN THE LAST CONGRESS. THIS YEAR IT ALSO PASSED THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES THERE IS- LEGISLATION UP IN THE HOUSE AND IT'S PENDING ON THE SENATE ON THE SENATE SENATOR MENENDEZ INTRODUCED A- COMPANION BILL. IT HAS NOT MOVED BUT WHAT THAT BILL IT IS A DISCLOSURE BAIL AND IT'S- A REASONABLE MEASURE% IT'S NOT ONEROUS BUT IT CALLS FOR YOU KNOW COMPANIES. FOR DIRECTORS TO SELF DISCLOSE AND THE COMPANY TO REPORT AS PART OF THEIR SEC REPORTING. WHAT THE COMPOSITION IS OF THE BOARD GENDER- RACE ETHNICITY AND VETERAN STATUS- SO THAT IS- YOU KNOW ONE WAY TO DO IT IS JUST FOR DIRECTORS TO SELF IDENTIFY IF THEY FEEL THAT YOU WANT TO DO IT IT'S NOT REQUIRED BUT- I THINK THAT'S- A REALLY GOOD MODEL FOR WHITE THAT CALIFORNIA CAN DO. ANYTHING JANET ALSO% MENTIONED THAT ILLINOIS I AT- PASSED A DISCLOSURE BILL AS WELL BUT I THINK WE'RE- WORKING WITH THEM AND I THINK THEY'RE STILL TRYING TO ACT. IT KIND OF PUT TOGETHER HOW TO PROCEED FOR NEXT STEPS OKAY AND THEN ANOTHER QUESTION I HAVE ACTUALLY ITS PRICE FOR BOTH YOU AND- THIS ONE IN TERMS OF- I SAW IN TERMS OF DAILY TALK ABOUT NEW DIRECTORS AND OF COURSE WERE ELECTED OFFICE SO WE KNOW ABOUT YOU KNOW PEOPLE BEING ELECTED AND THEN RE ELECTION AND SO FORTH. SO WE SAY NEW DIRECTORS IS- DOES THAT EXCLUDE PEOPLE WHO SAID SHE ARE BEING RE APPOINTED FOR ANOTHER TERM AND SO FORTH AND THEN I GUESS THE FOLLOW UP QUESTION AND THAT IS WHAT PERCENTAGE OF DIRECTORS IF YOU HAPPEN TO KNOW ACTUALLY TURNED OVER IN ANY TIME SO IN OTHER WORDS IF WE'RE JUST LOOKING AT NEED. AND OBVIOUSLY NEW DIRECTORS WHERE YOU LOOK FOR THE TRENDS. BUT HOUSE. SLOW HIS IS GOING TO BE IF THERE'S NOW A LOT TURN YEAH I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH TURNOVER THERE IS A CORPORATE. NO AS WELL SO- SO IT CAN YOU JUST SPEAK TO YOUR DATA RELATED TO NEW DIRECTORS AND THE PACE AT WHICH- THE FOR MAINLY LOOKING NEW DIRECTORS- THAT. THAT YOU KNOW HOW HOW. WHAT TO WHAT PERCENTAGE OF BOARDS IF YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO SEE TURN OVER TO START WITH SO ARE WE TALKING ABOUT THE VERY TINY PERCENTAGE OF. BOARD SEATS SIMILAR LOOKING AT NEW DIRECTORS. YES I'M HAPPY TO TALK ABOUT THAT THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION. SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT NEW APPOINTMENTS. ARE MADE DURING IT OUT A CERTAIN PERIOD DOES OUR NEW APPOINTMENTS NOT NECESSARILY. PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T HAVE A BOARD SEAT BEFORE WELL WE ARE- TRACKING NATIONAL DATA- SO FOR EXAMPLE JUST TO CLARIFY SO WHEN YOU SAY NEW APPOINTMENTS DOES COULD BEEN PEOPLE WHO ARE ON THE BOARD BEING APPOINTED FOR ANOTHER TERM. CORRECT OKAY NO NO MEANS IT IS- LET'S SAY YOU HAVE FOR EXAMPLE JANET SHE'S ALREADY ON ONE WARD IF SHE GETS NOMINATED TO ANOTHER COURT. THAT IS GOING ON OKAY SO. NEW APPOINTMENTS BUT IT COULD BE SOMEONE WHO'S HAD A POSITION BEFORE IN ANOTHER SHOULD. IN THE SAME PERIOD SHE CAN HAVE BEEN APPOINTED TO TWO BOARDS AND THAT IS A NEW COURT APPOINTMENT TO NEW BOARD APARTMENTS IN NAP HERE YET- NOW WE ARE LOOKING AT- SOME TRENDS REGARDING. OUT HOW MANY YEAH WOMEN IN LATINAS ARE IN WOMEN OF COLOR ARE BEING APPOINTED AS WELL AS FIRST TIME DIRECTORS FIRST TIME DIRECTOR NUMBER IS AN IMPORTANT ONE TO FOLLOW. BECAUSE IT'S RAINING- IN THE PAST. ORDS REALLY PRIORITIZE ADDING CEO COO CFO IS AND ISN'T AS MUCH DIVERSITY WITHIN THOSE FIELDS WE'RE SEEING A TREND IN OPENING THE APERTURE OF THE SKILL SET AT BEING ADDED TO THE BOARD TO OTHER C. SUITE LEVELS CHIEF HUMAN RESOURCE OFFICERS CHIEF INFORMATION OFFICERS AND OTHER AS VP LEVEL SO IT HASN'T COMPLETELY WE WERE TRENDING THERE I THINK THERE COULD BE A LOT MORE. MORE INCLUSION. CHECK IT IS TODAY ARE DEALING WITH SOME OF THE MOST COMPLEX ISSUES GIVEN OUR TECHNOLOGY GIVEN RESCUE GIVEN CYBER THAN WE'VE EVER HAD I ALWAYS SAY THERE ARE ALMOST. YEAH GOING TO PROVIDE A GREAT DEAL OF VALUE IN THE BOARDROOM. COMPARED TO SOMEONE WHO IS IN A C. OR FORTY YEARS AGO I'M JUST GIVING AN EXAMPLE OF COURSE AND IT WOULD BE VALUABLE TO BUT THERE IS- SOME TRAINED TO LOOK AT OTHER- SKILL SETS ARE WE'VE BEEN ON IN SOME. THE DATABASE IS NATIONWIDE WE'RE SEEING- AN INCREASE OF LATINO APPOINTMENTS IN OTHER YOU LOOK AT ALL THE STATES. AND OF THE NEW APPOINTMENTS THIS IS IN THE LAST SIX MONTHS OR TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FOUR- 40% OF THE APPOINTMENTS FOR LETTING US. WHICH IS HIGHER THAN IT'S TRENDING HIGHER AND 43% OR FIRST TIME DIRECTORS SO THERE'S SOME. PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED THAT WHAT ARE THE SAME PEOPLE WHO ARE ON BOARDS GETTING. TO ANOTHER ANOTHER. WE ARE SEEING A TREND IDENTIFYING FIRST TIME DIRECTORS. IN TERMS OF OVERALL TURNOVER EXCEEDS. THERE IS NOT SOME REPORTS LIKE HEIDRICK AND STRUGGLES MEASURES MEASURES IS THAT THEIR SEARCH FOR ALL AND OTHER SEARCH FORUMS MEASURE. YOU KNOW HOW MANY APPOINTMENTS OPENED UP AND TURNED OVER IN A SINGLE YEAR AND THE AND THEY BALK AT THE FORTUNE FIVE HUNDRED OF THE FORTUNE FIVE HUNDRED IT ENDS UP BEING- YOU KNOW. PROBABLY IN THE RANGE OF. THREE HUNDRED FOUR HUNDRED SEATS OF ALL OF THE THOUSANDS OF SEATS REPRESENTED BUT I THINK THOSE TWO REPORTS A FEW OF THOSE REPORTS WOULD GIVE YOU A GOOD MEASURE OF HOW MANY SEATS TURN OVER. IN FACT I THINK IT'S VERY MUCH ACTUALLY THIS ONE DID YOU WANT TO COMMENT AS WELL THE QUESTION. YES I WANTED TO ADD TO ESTHER'S RESPONSE I THINK. I SEE A LOOK A DIFFERENT SIDE OF IT BEING A CORPORATE DIRECTOR AND- PARTICIPATING WITH OTHER BOARD COLLEAGUES AND FORUMS. AND FROM WHAT I'VE SEEN YOU KNOW BOARDS ARE ACTUALLY ADDING SEATS TO. INCREASE AND HAVE A DIVERSE CANDIDATE IF THEY DON'T ALREADY HAVE ONE OR ADD MORE DIVERSE DIRECTORS. YOU HAVE SEEN THAT PERSONALLY WITH OF ONE OF. OF THE BOARD'S ACTUALLY TWO OF THE BOARDS THAT I'M ON A ADDED A SEAT AND WE'RE SPECIFICALLY LOOKING FOR SKILL SET. AS WELL AS SOMEBODY WITH. A RACIAL DIVERSITY BACKGROUND. AND IT GOES BACK TO I THINK THE COMMENT MADE. EARLIER IN THE OPENING- LIKE WE KNOW THERE ARE. VERY HIGHLY QUALIFIED. PEOPLE OF. OF DIVERSE NATURE. THAT CAN. SIT ON A BOARD. AND SO THAT IS SOMETHING ELSE THAT WE HELP EMPHASIZE BOTH THE ORGANIZATIONS THAT ESTHER AND I WORK WITH THE- ASCEND AS WELL AS LATINO CORPORATE DIRECTORS HAVE. SORT OF BORED READY- OUR SENIOR EXECUTIVES THAT ARE LOOKING FOR BOARD SERVICE. ALSO AGAIN I'VE SEEN ADDITIONAL BOARDS ADDED I'VE SEEN WHERE COMPANIES THAT ARE GOING PUBLIC AND NOTE YOU NEED TO HAVE A BOARD. OF YOU KNOW THEY'RE PAYING ATTENTION TO LAWS SUCH AS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA EVEN IF THEY AREN'T IN THE STATE. AND LOOKING TO HAVE DIVERSE DIRECTORS AS PART OF THEIR BOARD MAKE UP. AND ONE FINAL QUESTION I APPRECIATE THE PATIENCE OR TEARS- THIS ONE. WE'VE HEARD ABOUT THE CHALLENGES THAT THE AGGREGATE DISAGGREGATED DATA BUT IN THE H. I. COMMUNE DISAGGREGATION IS NOT IS ALSO ABOUT THE SAGGING WITHIN THE API CATEGORY RIGHTS ARE NEAR POINT PACIFIC ISLANDERS OFTEN GET JUST GET LUMPED IN. AND DAY OUT I DON'T THINK THEY'VE DONE IT AND SO THEY GET LOST IN THAT- WE HAVE TREMENDOUS DIVERSITY WITH THEIR API COMMUNITY- YOU KNOW IT'S A AND INTO MY OPENING REMARKS ONLY CERTAIN SUBSEGMENTS AND SO WHEN WE SAY API WE OFTEN GLOSS THAT OVER BECAUSE ONLY CERTAIN SUBSEGMENTS. OF OUR COMMUNITY- ACTUALLY AT LEAST HAVE SOME REPRESENTATION- MORE ENTRY LEVEL PROFESSIONAL TECHNICAL POSITIONS- CAN YOU SPEAK ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR DIS AGGREGATING AT LEAST CERTAINLY WITHIN THE API COMMUNITY AND FOR OTHER GROUPS MAY HAVE WANT TO DO THAT AS WELL. SO THAT WE'RE NOT JUST LUMPING. EVERYBODY IN LARGE UMBRELLAS. YES I AGREE I'VE- WITH MY VOLUNTEER ROLE WITH THE SAND I STARTED HELPING WORK ON RESEARCH AND PUBLISHING REPORTS ON. DIVERSITY WELL I WITHIN COMPANIES AND THAT WAS YOU KNOW ALWAYS WHAT WAS SO DIFFICULT IS THAT WE HAVE ONE CATEGORY FOR ASIANS WHICH INCLUDES A LOT OF COMPONENTS INCLUDING. THE SOUTH ASIAN COMMUNITY. AND SO WE- IN OUR BOARD DISCLOSURE MAKE UP- YOU KNOW CONSIDER THAT AS WELL I THINK IT WILL BE HELPFUL. BECAUSE IN SOME RESPECTS. I THINK UP. PEOPLE ESTIMATOR GAS THAT THERE'S MORE REPRESENTATION BY BOARD DIRECTORS THAT ARE SOUTH ASIANS BECAUSE THEY SEE LARGE COMPANIES SUCH AS MICROSOFT AND GOOGLE. YOU KNOW WHAT THEY'RE WHERE THEY'RE CEOS ARE SOUTH ASIAN SO I THINK THAT IS A GREAT POINT SENATOR PAN- IS FAR AS- REPORTING YOU KNOW EVEN. MORE INDIVIDUAL INFORMATION BY ALL RACIAL GROUPS. THANK THANK YOU VERY MUCH BYE THANK YOU THANK YOU. THANK IT AFTER TEN. AT THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE PRESENTATION I THINK WHAT THAT REALLY IS HIGHLIGHTED FOR ME IS THAT IT BE IT IT'S NOT ONLY IMPORTANT TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE A DIVERSITY IN REPRESENTATION. ON OUR BOARDS BUT ONCE A WE HAVE THAT REPRESENTATION THAT IT ACTUALLY HAS AN IMPACT ON THE POLICIES AND PRACTICES OF THE COMPANIES THAT PARTICULARLY AS IT RELATES TO DIVERSITY EQUITY AND INCLUSION PRACTICES THROUGHOUT THE COMPANY. I'M WONDERING IF EITHER OF THE PANELISTS HAVE THAT ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT OR HAVE BEEN TRACKING. THE EXTENT TO WHICH- THERE'S BEEN A SHIFT IN POLICY AND PRACTICE IN A BROADER DIVERT. BURGER POLICIES AROUND DIVERSITY EQUITY INCLUSION IN THE COMPANIES AS THEY ARE ALSO INCREASING THE NUMBER OF BOARD MEMBERS. WHO ARE AT FROM AT FROM DIVERSE. FROM DIVERSE AT COMMUNITIES. YEAH I CAN I CAN START IF YOU WOULD LIKE BECAUSE AGAIN I HAVE A PERSPECTIVE. SITTING ON FOR COMPANY BOARDS AS WELL AS INTERACTING WITH A LOT OF OTHER DIRECTORS FROM. IN A C. D. NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF CORPORATE DIRECTORS WOMEN CORPORATE DIRECTORS XTERRA AND THERE IS AN INCREASED FOCUS I THINK WE ALL FOUR OF MY BOARDS WE DO SPEND TIME AT THE BOARD MEETINGS ON. DIVERSITY AND EQUITY AND- VERY MUCH OF SUPPORTING OUR COMPANIES AND HELP THEM IN GROWING THAT PIPELINE YOU KNOW SPECIFICALLY FOR MY TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES YOU KNOW THERE IS. A LACK OF- BLACK AND LATINOS ESPECIALLY IN THE TECHNICAL AREAS AND SO. COMPANIES ARE LOOKING AT PROGRAMS WORKING ACTUALLY WITH OTHER COMPANIES AS TO HOW DO WE ATTRACT MORE PEOPLE INTO STEM A SPECIALLY PEOPLE OF COLOR. SO AGAIN I THINK COMPANIES THAT HAVE A STRONG CULTURE TO- YOU KNOW DEVELOP A WORK FORCE NOT JUST AT THE BOARD LEVEL ARE GOING TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN B. AND HELP. US CONTINUE TO BUILD A PIPELINE OF SENIOR LEVEL PEOPLE THAT CAN BE FUTURE BOARD DIRECTORS. I'M ALSO HAPPY TO WEIGH IN ARE YOU DON'T EAT IT LARGE INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS AND PENSION FUNDS HAVE BEEN INSTRUMENTAL IN THIS AREA- IS JANET MENTIONED WE CHEN I BOTH SERVE ON THE BOARD. OF THE 30% COALITION AND IT BRINGS TOGETHER A LOT OF THE LARGE INVESTORS AND PENSION FUNDS NO INCLUDING CASTERS AND NEW YORK STATE CMMONS AND ALL OF THEM WHO HAVE BEEN COALESCING. ARE TOO BRIGHT TO COMPANIES AND LEVERAGING. OUR SHAREHOLDER RESOLUTIONS AND THE PROXY VOTING TO- ADVOCATE. FOR MORE ADVANCEMENT AND BOARD DIVERSITY SO IT WILL BE POSSIBLE IN THE SHAREHOLDER RESOLUTION AND IF. YOU KNOW A COUPLE OF YEARS OF TALKING TO THE COMPANY OF THEIR NOT SEEING RESULTS THEY WILL REQUIRE. REQUESTED NO VOTE FOR THE CHAIR OF THE NOMINATING COMMITTEE OR THE FULL BORDER JUST CHANGE IN THE BOARD COMPOSITION SO IT'S BEEN HELPFUL TO SEE INVESTORS BECAUSE THEY ARE THE SHAREHOLDERS OF THESE COMPANIES AND THEY KNOW. THAT MORE. DIVERSE VOICES AND THE SKIT STRONG SKILL SETS AROUND THE TABLE ARE GONNA LEAD TO BETTER RESULTS- THE OTHER'S TRENDS WITH- THE INVESTORS THAT WE'RE SEEING AND HEARING IS THAT INVESTORS ARE ALSO. CALLING ON COMPANIES TO DISCLOSE THEIR IASI DATA AND THE WORKFORCE DATA ACROSS. THE BOARD AND AGAIN FROM WHEN YOU'RE SITTING AT THE STATE AS A SHAREHOLDER THE BOARD IS ACCOUNTABLE TO THE SHAREHOLDERS. THAT'S WHEN YOU KNOW THERE ARE ALSO PAYING ATTENTION I THINK- YOU KNOW CALLING FOR DISCLOSURE OF. THE THEIR WORK FIRST DATA PLUS THE BOARD DATA IT WOULD HELP IN ALL OF THIS AND TRACKING AGAIN BACK TO WHAT GETS MEASURED GETS RESULTS- YOU KNOW THAT WOULD BE A BIG HELP ACROSS THE STATE ACROSS THE COUNTRY. AND CERTAINLY- HAVING THE SHAREHOLDERS ADVOCATE AS WELL HAS BEEN A GOOD TREND SO WHAT WE'RE TELLING COMPANIES IS LIKE YOU NEED TO GET AHEAD OF THIS BECAUSE YOUR FIRST FOUR HOLDERS ARE YOU'RE GONNA BE HEARING FROM THEM. LAST MARCH- PROXY AND- LIGHT I ASSESS THE INSTITUTIONAL SHAREHOLDER SERVICES THE ADVICE ALL SHAREHOLDERS FOR HOW THEY CAN VOTE ON DIFFERENT JOB. PROXY VOTING AND THEY'RE ALSO WRITING TO COMPANIES ABOUT A- LACK OF RACE ETHNICITY ON THE BOARD- AND SAYING. KIND OF WARNING THEM HEY WE'RE GONNA RECOMMEND ALONG WITH GIVE SHAREHOLDERS A NO VOTE ON CERTAIN PERFORMANCE IT FOR NOT SEEING MORE DISCLOSURE MORE DIVERSITY IN THE BOARDROOM AND DISCLOSURE OF THE WORK FORCE- DEMOGRAPHICS. THANK YOU- I DO WANT TO. JOIN WITH MY COLLEAGUES AND SHOW APPRECIATION FOR BOTH OF YOUR PRESENTATIONS IN THE DEPTHS. OF THE SUBJECT AND HOW YOU OF SORT OF UNPACKED SOME OF THIS FOR US AND AS YOU CAN SEE. WE PROBABLY COULD HAVE HAD THE HEARING JUST ON THE TWO OF YOUR PRESENTATION- BUT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO TRANSITION TO THE TO THE NXT PANEL BUT IN DOING SO- JUST A ONE WORD A ONE WORD RESPONSE YES OR NO- WHEN S. B. BY A TWENTY EIGHT. WHAT A TWENTY SIX AND NINE AND AB NINE THREE NINE. AT THE ONSET OF THOSE BILLS WHEN THEY WERE BEING PRESENTED IN WORKING THROUGH THE PROCESS THERE IS A LOT OF THOSE WHO CHOSE TO OPPOSE THE BILLS. SAID THAT IT WAS GOING TO DRIVE BUSINESSES OUT OF CALIFORNIA. I'M SORT OF READING FROM YOUR PRESENTATIONS IN YOUR NUMBERS THE THAT'S NOT HAPPENING BUT IF YOU CAN JUST GIVE A- ONE WORD. IS THAT THOSE WORST FEARS. PLANED OUT IT IS NOT HAPPENING ASSEMBLYMEMBER HOLDEN BECAUSE THEY'RE ALSO HEARING FROM NEAR THE SEC APPROVED NASDAQ'S RESPONSE AND I'M JUST GONNA HAVE JUST VERY QUICKLY SHARE THAT SUPPLY IS NOT THE ISSUE THEY KEEP SAYING WELL WE CAN'T FIND QUALIFIED THIS OR THAT OUR ORGANIZATIONS OUR ORGANIZATION IS A RESOURCE TO TAP QUALIFY THE TEAM KNOWS IT EVERY INDUSTRY AND SO WE'RE HERE TO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION. LET'S NOT LET THEM HAVE THE EXCUSE THAT THEY CAN'T FIND THE TALENT THERE IS TALENT. AND CAN JUST QUICKLY TO ADD ON TO ESTHER'S COMMENT YEAH I AGREE NO IT'S NOT DRIVING COMPANIES AWAY I JUST GAVE A GREAT ILLUSTRATION OF. LUCID WHO IS CONTINUING TO GROW AND ADD PEOPLE AND PURPOSELY- HAVE KEPT THEIR HEADQUARTERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND YOU KNOW STARTED THEIR BOARD WITH THREE PEOPLE THAT TO HELP IT MEET THAT SB EIGHT TWENTY SIX AND AB NINE SEVEN NINE. THANK YOU I'LL TURN TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA HOLINESS AND PANEL TO. THANK YOU TO THANK YOU THANK YOU TO OUR SPEAKERS AND PANEL ONE FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE BALLING US REMOTELY ONE REMAIN THE ABOUT THE HASHTAGS AB NINE SEVEN NINE CORPORATE CITY AN OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL THAT WE COULD CONTINUE TO TRACK THIS CONVERSATION ON SOCIAL MEDIA OUT THERE DO APPRECIATE THAT FOR A SECOND PANEL WILL DISCUSS BEVERAGE THE FIND THE PUBLIC SECTOR. HIS PANEL FOCUS ON INCREASING OUTREACH TO UNDERREPRESENTED COMMUNITIES FOR CONTRACTING AND CREATING ENVIRONMENTS THAT ARE NOT THAT NOT ONLY EMBRACE DIVERSITY BUT ALSO ACTIVELY REDUCE BARRIERS TO UPWARD MOBILITY. OUR FIRST PANELIST IS ANGELA SHALL ANGELES SHALL WAS APPOINTED DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE PROCUREMENT DIVISION AT THE DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES AND CHIEF PROCUREMENT OFFICER FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ON NOVEMBER FIRST TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN. IN YOUR CURRENT ROLE ANGELES RESPONSIBLE FOR OVERSEEING THE STATE'S PURCHASE OF GOODS AND SERVICES. VITAL TO STATE DEPARTMENT OPERATIONS THAT SERVE THE NEEDS OF CALIFORNIA. THIS INCLUDES DEVELOPING AND A WARNING STATEWIDE LEVERAGE PROCUREMENT AGREEMENTS DELEGATING PURCHASING AUTHORITY DEVELOPING STATEWIDE POLICY AND TRAINING IDENTIFYING SUSTAINABLE PROCUREMENT METHODS AND PRODUCTS AND CERTIFYING SMALL AND DISABLED VETERAN BUSINESS ENTERPRISE. THANK YOU MICHELLE FOR PARTICIPATING TODAY YOU MAY PROCEED. AFTERNOON AND THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER HOLDEN AND ASSEMBLYMEMBER GARCIA FOR INVITING DEPARTMENT GENERAL SERVICES TO SPEAK ON DIVERSITY IN SMALL BUSINESS PROCUREMENT DURING TODAY'S INFORMATIONAL HEARING. THE DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES HAS BEEN ACTIVELY WORKING TOWARD GREATER DIVERSITY IN BOTH THE SMALL BUSINESS AND DISABLED VETERAN BUSINESS PROGRAMS AS WELL AS THOSE VENDORS THAT ARE NOT CURRENTLY CERTIFIED BUT WHO HAVE INTEREST IN CONTRACTING WITH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. RELATED TO OUR OUTREACH EFFORTS THE DEPARTMENT HAS A LONG ESTABLISHED OFFICE OF SMALL AND-DISTANT BUSINESS SERVICES THAT FOCUSES ON CERTIFICATION OF THESE BUSINESSES AND OUT REACH ON STATE CONTRACTING OPPORTUNITIES. TO ORGANIZATIONS THAT SERVE THE BUSINESS COMMUNITIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA SUCH AS ETHNIC CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE PROCUREMENT AND TRAINING ASSISTANCE CENTERS PUBLIC AGENCY CONSORTIUMS VETERAN BUSINESS CENTERS AND THE WESTERN REGIONAL MINORITY SUPPLIER DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL. THE DEPARTMENT HAS ESTABLISHED OVER THIRTY OF THESE STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIPS AND PROVIDES FUNDING ANNUALLY SPECIFICALLY FOR OUTREACH EVENTS AND MEDIA COMMUNICATIONS THAT INCORPORATE INFORMATION ON HOW TO GET CERTIFIED AND HOW TO COMPETE FOR STATE CONTRACTING OPPORTUNITIES. IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE FISCAL YEAR THE DEPARTMENT ATTENDED A HUNDRED AND THIRTY TWO EVENTS WITH APPROXIMATELY SIXTY SEVEN HUNDRED IN ATTENDANCE THESE INCLUDED WORKSHOPS WEBINARS BUSINESS MATCH MAKING AND PANELS THAT PROVIDE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR INTERESTED BUSINESSES TO LEARN MORE ABOUT STATE OPPORTUNITIES. DGS WILL BE PRESENTING ON STATE CONTRACTING OPPORTUNITIES ALONGSIDE THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE AT NEXT WEEK'S INSURANCE DIVERSITY SUMMIT. IN ADDITION TO ITS OUTREACH ACTIVITIES WITH ITS STRATEGIC PARTNERS SUCH AS THE CALIFORNIA HISPANIC CHAMBER AND THE NATIONAL LATINO WOMEN BUSINESS ASSOCIATION. WE REPRESENT HISTORICALLY DISADVANTAGED BUSINESS OWNERS DGS ALSO WORKS DIRECTLY WITH BUSINESSES THAT NEED ASSISTANCE UNDERSTANDING STATE CONTRACTING REQUIREMENTS AND WE DO THIS THROUGH STAFF WILL HAVE THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE INTERPRETER SERVICES. AS WELL AS USE OF A STATE WIDE CONTRACT FOR THIS SPECIFIC SERVICE TRANSLATING DOCUMENTS INTO OTHER LANGUAGES SUCH AS SPANISH. UP HOSTING OUR ONLINE TRAINING VIDEOS IN OTHER LANGUAGES SUCH AS SPANISH ON RGS WEBSITE. AND OFFERING DIRECT ONE ON ONE COUNSELING TO BUSINESSES ON NAVIGATING STATE PROCESSES. IN AN EFFORT TO UNDERSTAND OUR OUTREACH EFFECTIVENESS AND- IN UNDERSERVED AND DISADVANTAGED AREAS AND INFORM OUR STRATEGIES MOVING FORWARD WE'VE RECENTLY DEVELOPED WHAT WE'RE CALLING THE CAL SOCKS TOOL THIS IS THE CALIFORNIA SB DVP ATLAS'S. THAT OVERLAYS ARE TWENTY ONE THOUSAND PLUS CERTIFIED FIRMS GIS LOCATION ALONG WITH THEIR PROCUREMENT DOLLARS USING THE CAL EPA DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES CAL ENVIRO SCREEN MAPPING TOOL. CALAVERAS IN SKEWS ME CAL ENVIRO SCREEN USES DOT C. O. ECONOMIC FACTORS FACTORS- FOR EXAMPLE HIGH POVERTY HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT REALISTIC ISOLATION SEVERE HOUSING BURDEN LOW EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT ALONG WITH ENVIRONMENTAL AND HEALTH FACTORS IN DETERMINING IF A COMMUNITY IS DISADVANTAGED SO WERE USING THAT. PARTICULAR DEFINITION. THIS IS AN IDEAL TOOL TO INTEGRATE WITH OUR CERTIFICATION AND OUTREACH DATA GIVEN OUR LIMITATIONS DUE TO PROP TWO OH NINE SO WHILE IT DOESN'T EXPLICITLY INCLUDE RACE AND ETHNICITY INDICATORS THE TOOL DOES COME WITH A COMPLIMENTARY RACE ETHNICITY AND AGE ANALYSIS. CONCLUDING THAT DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES ARE MOST LIKELY TO BE PREDOMINANTLY OF PEOPLE OF COLOR SO USING THE CALLOUS THAT MAP WE WILL BE ABLE TO SEE WHERE WE NEED TO INTENSIFY OUR OUTREACH EFFORTS AND SEEK ADDITIONAL STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIPS TO ENSURE WE REACH OUT. IN THOSE SPECIFIC COMMUNITIES. IN TWENTY TWENTY DGS ALSO BEGAN WORKING CLOSELY WITH ITS AGENCY GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS TO ESTABLISH A MINORITY FOCUSED TASK FORCE THAT INCLUDES MINORITY SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS AND ETHNIC CHAMBERS TO IDENTIFY REAL TIME ISSUES IMPACTING THESE BUSINESSES DURING THE PANDEMIC. HOWEVER THE GROUP HAS EXPANDED AND MEETS MONTHLY TO CONTINUE PROVIDING FEEDBACK ON THE NEEDS OF MINORITY SMALL BUSINESSES. ONE PRACTICAL EXAMPLE OF THIS INITIATIVE- WASN'T PPD CONTRACT THAT WAS A STATEMENT CONTRACT ISSUED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES WORKING DIRECTLY WITH THE PARTNERS ON THIS TASK GROUP- THAT ALLOWED US TO AWARD. ADDITIONAL CONTRACTS TO SMALL BUSINESSES AND MINORITY OWNED BUSINESSES AS WELL AS DISADVANTAGED I'M SORRY- DISABLED VETERAN BUSINESS ENTERPRISES- SO THIS IS THIS WAS A GREAT EFFORT AND WE ATTRIBUTE OUR SUCCESS BACK TO THE ASSISTANCE OF THE- MINORITY FOCUSED TASK GROUP. RELATED TO OUR DATA COLLECTION EFFORTS THE STATE DOES COLLECTED VOLUNTARILY SUBMITTED DATA ON THE ETHNICITY RACE GENDER AND SEXUAL ORIENTATION OF BUSINESS OWNERS. TO DATE THE RESPONSE RATE IS VERY LIMITED BUT WE AREN'T WORKING ON WAYS TO INCREASE IT. ACCORDING TO PARTNERS ARE REQUIRED TO SEND A VOLUNTARY STATISTICAL DATA SHEET EVERY BUSINESS OWNER WHO WAS AWARDED A STATE CONTRACT. DEPARTMENTS CONTINUE TO REPORT THAT MANY FORMS ARE NOT RETURNED BY BUSINESS OWNERS WITH ONLY 40% OF THE DEPARTMENTS HAVING DATA TO REPORT IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TWENTY WHICH WAS A SLIGHT DECREASE WHEN COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR. AGAIN THIS IS VOLUNTARY INFORMATION TO HELP FACILITATE BETTER REPORTING OF THIS INFORMATION DGS IS EMBARKING ON AN EFFORT TO DEVELOP AN ONLINE A VOLUNTARY ETHNICITY GENDER AND SEXUAL ORIENTATION SURVEY USING THEIR FISCAL SYSTEM FOR OWNERS OF BUSINESSES THAT ARE CONTRACTING WITH THE STATE. OUR HOPE IS THAT THE ONLINE SURVEY PORTAL WILL BE. MORE EASILY ACCESSIBLE FOR BUSINESSES AND IT WILL PRESERVE THE CONFIDENTIALITY COP CONFIDENTIALITY OF RESPONSES AND THEN ALSO AGAIN REMOVE ARTIFICIAL BARRIERS FROM REPORTING ON THIS INFORMATION. DGS USES THE LIMITED INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THE REPORT TO ENSURE CONTINUED OUT REACHED ORGANIZATIONS REPRESENTING THE GROUPS IDENTIFIED IN THE REPORT. DGS DOES NOT CURRENTLY COLLECT DEMOGRAPHIC DATA ON SMALL BUSINESS OR DVB OWNERS THROUGH ITS CERTIFICATION PROGRAMS ONLY THROUGH THE VOLUNTARY REPORTING PROCESS WHICH IS AGAIN TIED TO CONTRACT AWARDS. WE ARE CONSIDERING ALLOWING STATE VENDORS TO VOLUNTARILY PROVIDE DEMOGRAPHIC. BOARDING IN BOTH THEIR VENDOR ANSWER CERTIFICATION PROFILES THAT ARE CONTAINED WITHIN THE STATE'S TO VOLUNTARY REPORTING. UP WITH RESPECT TO THE DISADVANTAGED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM- I CAN'T ANSWER SOME BASIC QUESTIONS ABOUT THE CALTRANS DVD PROGRAM BUT IT IS SPECIFIC TO FEDERAL TRANSPORTATION DOLLARS- IF THE COMMITTEE DESIRES- THE DVD PROGRAM IS BASED ON SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC DISADVANTAGE STATUS WITH SIX CATEGORIES CONSIDERED UNDER THAT- SOCIALLY DISADVANTAGED AND IT INCLUDES WOMEN AGAIN THIS IS A FEDERAL PROGRAM THAT IS NOT A STATE CALIFORNIA PROGRAM. AND IT IS ONLY USED ON CONTRACTS THAT HAVE FEDERAL FUNDING TIED TO THEM. FINALLY RELATED TO THE STATE'S SMALL BUSINESS AND DISABLED VETERAN BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAMS IN THIS FISCAL YEAR NINETEEN TWENTY THE STATE CHIEF JUSTICE UNDER ITS 25% SMALL BUSINESS SCHOOL AT TWENTY THREE POINT SEVEN PERCENT. BUT WE CHEAP THREE POINT 87% AGAINST THE 3% DVB EAGLE WILDFIRE AND COVERT SUPPORT OPERATIONS NECESSITATED A LARGE GROWTH IN EMERGENCY SPEND DOLLARS IN WHICH SMALL BUSINESSES AND DVDS HAVE HISTORICALLY HAD LIMITED PARTICIPATION. WITH ONE OF THE EMERGENCY SPEND DOLLARS THE STATE WOULD HAVE ACHIEVED THIRTY SIX POINT 27% FOR SMALL BUSINESS AND FIVE POINT 54% FOURTEEN VP. SO TO INCREASE OPPORTUNITIES FOR THESE FIRMS TO PARTICIPATE IN EMERGENCY PROCUREMENTS TODAY DGS IS LAUNCHED LAUNCHING AN ONLINE EVE URGENCY REGISTRY TOOL THAT WILL ALLOW SMALL BUSINESS AND DISABLED VETERAN BUSINESS ENTERPRISE FIRMS TO PROVIDE INFORMATION ON THEIR SPECIFIC CAPACITY. TO RESPOND TO EMERGENCIES. OUR STATE BUYERS WILL USE THIS TOOL TO IDENTIFY AVAILABLE FIRMS TO CONNECT WITH FOR CONTRACTING OPPORTUNITIES AGAINST SPECIFIC TO THAT EMERGENCY NEED. BERMAN BELIEVES THE USE OF THIS TOOL WILL ALLOW THE STATE TO INCREASE THE DEBT PERSONALLY BUSINESSES USE DURING EMERGENCY OPERATIONS AND PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR MORE BUSINESSES TO EXPERIENCE WORKING WITH STATE CONTRACTING PROCESSES. THAT ULTIMATELY ALLOWS THEM TO ENHANCE THEIR ABILITY TO COMPETE ON FUTURE NON EMERGENCY PROCUREMENTS. AS OF SEPTEMBER EIGHTH TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE UC AND DGS HAVE ENTERED INTO A RECIPROCITY AGREEMENT WHERE THE UC WILL ACCEPT THE GSS S. B. A D. V. B. E. CERTIFICATIONS AS PART OF THE UC SMALL BUSINESS FIRST PROGRAM. DGS RECIPROCITY PARTNERSHIP WITH THE UC FORMALIZES THE AVAILABILITY OF THE UC PROGRAMS BENEFITS TO OUR ESPYS AND DVB. THIS PARTNERSHIP STREAMLINES THE PROCUREMENT PROCESS FOR THESE BUSINESSES AND PROVIDES ADDITIONAL CONTRACTING OPPORTUNITIES WITH THE GOAL OF INCREASED DOLLARS GOING TOWARD CERTIFIED FARMS. DGS WILL MARKET THIS ADDITIONAL ATTRACTING OPPORTUNITY TO ITS STRATEGIC PARTNERS AS WELL AS DURING ALL OF ITS OUTREACH EVENTS SO THAT THE ATTENDEES ARE AWARE OF THIS ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITY. AND LASTLY THE DEPARTMENT HAS ESTABLISHED A NEW EXECUTIVE LEVEL POSITION WITHIN THE PROCUREMENT DIVISION TITLE THE STATE WIDE SUPPLIER DIVERSITY PROGRAM MANAGER WHO WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THE POLICY STRATEGIES AIMED AT IMPROVING EQUITY AND ACHIEVING GREATER DIVERSITY IN THE SUPPLY STATE SUPPLIER BASE. THESE ARE JUST SOME EXAMPLES OF THE ACTIVITIES THE DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN ENGAGING IN TO SUPPORT THE STATE'S BUSINESS ECONOMIC RECOVERY AND DIVERSITY THROUGH PROCUREMENT OPERATIONS AGAIN THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE THIS INFORMATION AND I'M HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS. THANK YOU WE'RE GONNA HOLD OFF- FOR QUESTIONS AT THE END OF THE PANEL. NEXT WE HAVE. ATRIA JENKINS JONES CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR AT THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN RESOURCES ON AUGUST THIRTY FIRST TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN GOVERNOR EDMUND G.

ASSOCIATE PERSONNEL ANALYST EXECUTIVE ASSISTANT CHIEF OF RECRUITMENT AND SELECTION ASSISTANT PERSONNEL IDALUS THAT SERVICE ANALYST AND EXAMINATION TECHNICIAN THANK YOU FOR MAKING TIME TO THEN YOU MAY PROCEED. HEARING GREETINGS SHARE GARCIA HOLDEN IN OP FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO APPEAR BEFORE YOU ON THE BEHALF OF CALLING CHAR TO THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON CORPORATE BOARD IN CALIFORNIA'S ADVERSITY OR FOR STAFFERS CITY KALINJAR STRIVES TO EMPLOY A WORKFORCE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND MARKETS ITS DIVERSE POPULATION. DURING GOVERNESSES JUNIOR HE CONVENE MEETINGS FOR EXECUTIVE BRANCH LEADERS TO DISCUSS HOW THE STATE EMPLOYER CAN ACHIEVE THE STATE WORKPLACE THAT IS DIVERSE EQUITABLE HE REFLECTS THE VALUES OF CALIFORNIANS WILL CALL THIS INITIATIVE IS KNOWN AS CALIFORNIA LEADS FROM THESE MEETINGS TASK FORCE WORKS DAMPENS TO MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS TO ADDRESS PAY EQUITY AND THE ELEVATION OF PROGRAMS AND POLICIES THAT. IMPACT PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. THOSE TWO WRECKED WILL BE FINALIZED IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS. KALINJAR IS FULLY EQUIPPED TO MEET STATEWIDE HUMAN RESOURCES NEEDS IN SOME AREAS IN OTHER AREAS THE DEPARTMENT NEEDS FURTHER SUPPORT FOR THE PROGRAMS AND RESOURCES NECESSARY TO FULLY ACHIEVE DESIRED OUTCOMES. FOR THIS REASON KALINJAR IS EXPLORING IDEAS TO MEET THE GOALS OF THE CALIFORNIA LEADS INITIATIVES. ALLEN CHAU WAS ASKED BY THE COMMITTEE TO ADDRESS THE FOLLOWING WORK FOR STAFF VERY CITY TEENS GROUP IN AND RETAINING A DIVERSE WORKFORCE IMPORTANCE OF COLLECTING DEMOGRAPHIC DATA. CREATING DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION POLICY SPECIFICALLY IN REGARDS TO RACIAL AND GENDER IDENTITY. ON THE WAGE GAP. BEFORE I SPEAK OF A SPECIFIC TOPICS I WOULD LIKE TO PROVIDE SOME ADDITIONAL CONTEXT BASED ON THE MOST RECENT POPULATION DATA WHICH WAS CALCULATED USING DATA FROM THE AMERICAN COMMUNITY SURVEY ONE YEAR ESTIMATES COMPARISON PROFILES. FOR THE CALENDAR YEARS. TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND TWENTY NINETEEN. THE CALIFORNIA LATINO POPULATION INCREASE FROM 38% NINETEEN WHILE THE LATINO POPULATION FOR CIVIL SERVICE EMPLOYEES INCREASE FROM TWENTY TWO PERCENT. 28% FOR THE SAME YEARS. LIKEWISE THE ASIAN POPULATION INCREASED FROM 13% SERVICE EMPLOYEES INCREASED FROM FIFTEEN PERCENT. 20% THE STATE'S BLACK POPULATION REMAIN THE SAME AT SIX PER TO SET FOR TWO THOUSAND AND TEN AND TWENTY NINETEEN HOWEVER THE POPULATION IN THE BLACK COMMUNITY FOR STATE CIVIL SERVICE EMPLOYEES DECREASED FROM 11% 29% LIKEWISE THERE WAS A DECREASE IN THE STATE WHITE POPULATION FROM 40% CIVIL SERVICE EMPLOYEES POPULATION FROM FORTY EIGHT PERCENT. 44% THE POPULATION IDENTIFIED AS OTHER REMAIN THE SAME AT 4% FOR TWENTY TEN AND TWENTY NINETEEN THANK INCREASED ONLY BY ONE PERCENT. FOR STATE SALES SERVICE EMPLOYEES. RECRUITING AND RETAINING A DIVERSE WORK FORCE BASED ON THE POPULATION DATA THERE HAS BEEN A SLIGHT INCREASE IN DIVERSITY IN THE STATE'S POPULATION AS WELL AS IN THE CIVIL SERVICE EMPLOYEE POPULATION. KALINJAR RECOGNIZES THAT DIVERSITY IS AN INTEGRAL PART IN TODAY'S WORKPLACE CULTURE AND THAT THERE IS A GROWING SIGNIFICANCE PLACED ON CREATING DIVERSE ENVIRONMENTS THAT INCLUDES IN CONSIDERATION OF RACE ETHNICITY AGE GENDER DISABILITY VETERAN STATUS. I SURE OF A DIVERSE WORKPLACE THAT IS FREE OF DISCRIMINATION FOR ALL IS CRITICAL TO THE SUCCESS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AS A MODEL IN SLOW HERE THE PEOPLE THAT IT SERVES. KALINJAR IS CURRENTLY EXPLORING NEW IDEAS TO SUPPORT IMPROVED HIRING PRACTICES AND PROCESSES. FOR EXAMPLE INCORPORATING AN ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS OR BLIND HIRING INITIATIVE WHERE CANDIDATES APPLICATIONS PROTECTED DEMOGRAPHIC DATA IS HIDDEN FROM THE RESPECTIVE SELECTION IN HIRING PATTERNS. IT IS OUR HOPE THAT BY IMPLEMENTING THIS INITIATIVE WE LESSEN THE- CONSCIOUS BIAS INHERENT IN THE HIRING PROCESS. IN ADDITION WE CONTINUE TO TRAIN AND EDUCATE LEADERSHIP AND WORKFORCE ON HOW TO RECOGNIZE UNCONSCIOUS BIAS IN THEMSELVES IN THEIR ORGANIZATION AND HOW TO MITIGATE IT AS WELL AS OTHER FORMS OF BIAS. THIS CURRICULUM IS MANDATORY FOR ALL NEW TO ROLL SUPERVISORS AND MANAGERS. THERE OF COURSE IS ALSO AVAILABLE TO THE GENERAL WORKFORCE AND KALINJAR IS CONTINUOUSLY VETTING NEW COURSES TO ADD TO THE TRAINING CARILLO. COLLECTING KIDDING DEMOGRAPHIC DATA IS VERY IMPORTANT ONE OF KELLY GEORGE GRANULOSA CALIFORNIA'S WORKFORCE IS TO REFLECT THE DIVERSITY OF THE STATE'S RESIDENTS WE SIR. KALINJAR BELIEVES WE CAN ACCOMPLISH THIS BY CONTINUING TO MONITOR THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF THE STATE'S WORKFORCE AND LEVERAGE THAT DATA TO MAKE TARGETED DATA DRIVEN THE CREW RECOMMENDATIONS AND DECISIONS. CONSISTENTLY COLLECTING AND ANALYZING DEMOGRAPHIC DATA MAINTAINING IT AND CREATING DASHBOARDS FOR USERS WILL FURTHER BRING TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY TO THOSE EFFORTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS. OUR EXPECTATION IS THAT OUR SUCCESS WILL BE SEEN WHEN THE DATA MORE ACCURATELY REFLECTS THAT HAVE PERSONALLY OF THE RESIDENTS OF THE STATE. ADDITIONALLY KALINJAR. WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT DIVISION HAS WORKED WITH THE STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE TO PRODUCE ONE DEMAND MANAGEMENT INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEM RECORDS SO THAT DEPARTMENTS CAN MORE EASILY MORE REGULARLY AND MORE ACCURATELY DRAW THEIR OWN WORKFORCE DATA TO ANALYZE THEIR DEPARTMENTS DEMOGRAPHICS RACE ETHNICITY GENDER DISABILITY AGE DATA AND GAIN A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THEIR INDIVIDUAL WORK FORCE MAKE UP. ROOT MEAN OPPORTUNITIES AND RISKS THIS INFORMATION WILL ALSO SERVE TO GUIDE THEIR DIVERSITY EQUITY AND INCLUSION AS WELL AS OTHER IMPORTANT WORKFORCE PLANNING FACTORS SUCH AS CAREER DEVELOPMENT RETENTION AND TURNOVER AS WELL AS SUCCESSION PLANNING MANAGEMENT. NEW DEMOGRAPHIC DATA COLLECTION CATEGORIES SUCH AS GENDER IDENTITY AND SEXUAL ORIENTATION AND OTHERS CURRENTLY DO NOT EXIST WITHIN STATE EMPLOYMENT AND A MECHANISM FOR COLLECTING SUCH DATA IS NEEDED. ADDITIONAL PROGRAMMING A STATE DATA COLLECTION SYSTEMS WILL BE AN EXTENSIVE PROJECT REQUIRING RESOURCES AND SIGNIFICANT TIME. CREATING DIVERSE INCLUSION POLICIES. THE EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY IS TO BE AFFORDED TO ALL APPLICANTS AND EMPLOYEES WITHOUT REGARD TO AGE ANCESTRY COLOR DISABILITY MENTAL OR PHYSICAL ENGAGING IN A PROTECTED ACTIVITY GENDER GENDER IDENTITY OR EXPRESSION GENETIC INFORMATION. MARITAL STATUS MEDICAL CONDITION MILITARY VETERAN STATUS NATIONAL ORIGIN POLITICAL AFFILIATION HI MISSY RACE RELIGION SEX SEXUAL ORIENTATION KALINJAR IS OFFICES OVER RIGHTS PROVIDES GUIDANCE ON THE ROLL. OUT TO ALL STATE DEPARTMENTS IN ANNUALLY RECEIVES EACH DEPARTMENT'S WORKFORCE ANALYSIS AND ACTION PLANS TO ADDRESS WORKFORCE UNDER REPRESENTATION. EACH STATE AGENCY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR IMPLEMENTING NONDISCRIMINATION POLICIES PROCEDURES AND PRACTICES AND ENSURING THEY ARE INTEGRATED INTO EVERY ASPECT OF EMPLOYING- POINTING POWER OF EACH AGENCY IS REQUIRED TO APPOINT THE MANAGERIAL LEVEL IN E. O. OFFICER WHOSE PRIMARY ROLE IS TO OBJECTIVELY MONITOR AND ASSESS AGENCY PERSONNEL POLICIES AND PRACTICES. WELCOME ME INTO MINISTRY CHANGES TO PREVENT DISCRIMINATION AND TO CONTINUOUSLY FACILITATE EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY THESE POSITIONS ARE REQUIRED BY GOVERNMENT CO TO REPORT. CORRECTLY TO THE DIRECTOR OF EACH STATE DEPARTMENT. THE WAGE GAP KALINJAR IS STATUTORILY OBLIGATED TO REQUIRE DEPARTMENTS TO UPHOLD THE STATE'S MERIT BASED HIRING PRINCIPLES. STATE SALARY RANGES ARE SET BY DUKE'S BASE SALARY ANALYSIS THAT ARE BLIND TO GENDER THE GENDER PAY GAP IS THE SALARIES BETWEEN DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FEMALE AND MALE WORKERS. ANNUALLY THE MEDIAN SALARY OF MALE EMPLOYEES IS COMPARED TO THE MEDIAN SALARY A FEMALE EMPLOYEE. THIS DOLLAR DIFFERENCE IS CONVERTED TO A PERCENTAGE DIFFERENCE OF THE FEMALE LEAD TO THE MAIL ME. HISTORICALLY AND PRESENTLY GENDER BASED OCCUPATIONAL SEGREGATION CONTRIBUTES TO THE PAY GAP BECAUSE FEMALE DOMINATED WORK PAYS LESS OVERALL THAN MALE DOMINATED WORK. THE TYPE OF WORK WOMEN PERFORM DETERMINES YOUR SALARY LEVEL INFLUENCES THE GENDER PAY GAP. ALL THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE GENDER PAY GAP FOR FULL TIME EMPLOYEES IN CIVIL SERVICE WAS IT 17% THIS IS A DECREASE FROM THE TWENTY SIXTEEN GENDER PAY GAP OF NINETEEN POINT 5% THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN ANNUAL CENSUS OF THE EMPLOYEES IN STATE CIVIL SERVICE SHOWS THAT NEED MADE UP 50% OR MORE OF ALL SALARY RANGES ABOUT SEVENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. THE RANGE WITH THE HIGHEST PROPORTION OF NEED SIXTY FIVE POINT 6% WAS A HUNDRED THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS ANNUALLY. WOMEN MADE A 50% OR MORE OF ALLTHE SALARY RANGES SEVENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS AND ALLOW. THE FORTY THOUSAND DOLLAR IN ABOVE RANGE CONTAINS THE HIGHEST. OR SHOULD OF WOMEN AT FIFTY EIGHT POINT 1% THE MEDIAN EARNINGS OF WOMEN WORKING IN CIVIL SERVICE WORK MEN WORKING IN CIVIL SERVICE. THE CALIFORNIA CIVIL SERVICE GENDER PAY GAP WAS LOWER THAN THE NATIONAL LABOR FORCE FIGURE OF NINETEEN POINT 3% AS RECORDED BY THE UNITED STATES CENSUS BUREAU IN THEIR AMERICAN COMMUNITY SURVEY DATA OUT OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN. KALINJAR IS WORKING ON A NEW APPROACH TO ANALYZING THE STATE'S JUNIOR AND WAGE DATA. IN ADDITION TO USUAL COMPARISON OF MEDIAN MONTHLY PAY BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN. A MORE DETAILED ANALYSIS BY BARGAINING YOU. OCCUPATIONAL LEVEL IN CLASSIFICATION LEVEL WAS CONDUCTED. THE NEW APPROACH ALLOWS THE STATE TO DRAW CONCLUSIONS AND MAKE TARGETED RECOMMENDATIONS THAT MAY BE MORE SUCCESSFUL IN MARY THE PAY GAP OVER TIME. IN CLOSING THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME TODAY TO DISCUSS COUNTY CHOICE KERN IN PERSPECTIVE EFFORTS ON WORKFORCE CENTERS TODAY AS YOU CAN SEE KALINJAR IS WORKING ON DIFFERENT FRONTS TO ENSURE THAT STATE WORKFORCE WITH SLACKS AND DIVERSE CITY IN THE STATE. THIS IS ALWAYS MORE THAT THE STATE CAN DEAR AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR IDEAS AND YOUR INPUT ON THESE EFFORTS. THANK YOU.

INITIATIVES NOT ONLY OUR SHIFT MINDSETS BUT TRANSFORM THE CULTURE OF THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY FROM THE INSIDE OUT GIVEN THE WAY FORMER EXPERIENCES AS A MEMBER OF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE. IT IS IMPORTANT FOR ME TO CONTINUE PUSHING FORWARD POLICIES THAT REALLY CENTER AROUND CONSUMER PROTECTION THROUGH THE LENS OF EQUITY AND JUSTICE FOR ALL. AS A REGULATOR THIS MEANS- REFINING OUR IMPACT AND PUSH FOR EQUITY AND JUSTICE FOR ALL ALL AT BOTH THE LOCAL AND NATIONAL LEVELS ULTIMATELY THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY NEEDS TO REALLY REFLECT THE DIVERSITY OF THE PEOPLE IT SERVES. ESPECIALLY IN THE MOST DIVERSE STATE IN THE UNION IN ORDER FOR THIS TO HAPPEN THE INDUSTRY NEEDS TO GET VERY COMFORTABLE SPEAKING THE LANGUAGE OF DIVERSITY EQUITY AND INCLUSION. WE HAVE ALREADY SEEN HOW- HOW PURPOSE TRANSLATES INTO POLICIES WITH LAWS LIKE CALIFORNIA'S FIRST BOARD GENDER DIVERSITY LAW AS YOU KNOW SB EIGHT TWO SIX IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND- THAT WAS PRETTY SPEARHEADED BY A FORMER COLLEAGUE. CENTER HANNAH BETH JACKSON AND OUR FIRST DIVERSITY CORPORATE DIRECTOR LAW ARE WE COST. THIRD- BUT OUR I WAS EAGER HOLDEN.

YOUR LEADERSHIP IN ADDRESSING THE ISSUE OF DIVERSITY YOU'VE YOU'VE ARTICULATED THAT WELL BUT I CAN SAY THAT EARLIER THIS YEAR YOU HOSTED IN MADE VERY SPECIFIC AND INTENTIONAL. EFFORT TO RAISE DIVERSITY AMONGST THOSE COMPANIES THAT MAY NOT FALL UNDER NINE SEVENTY NINE BUT FALL CLEARLY UNDER YOUR JURISDICTION- TO MAKE IT MAKE THEM AWARE OF THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING A DIVERSE WORKFORCE BUT ALSO LEADERSHIP ON THEIR BOARDS OF DIRECTORS AS WELL AND YOU'RE SO YOUR I JUST WANTED TO ACKNOWLEDGE PUBLICLY YOUR- CONTINUED EFFORT THOUGHTFUL LEADERSHIP- WEATHER WAS HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE. OR AS YOU'VE NOW TAKEN A VERY IMPORTANT NATIONAL PRESENCE AS AMONGST INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS TO BRING TO LIFT THIS PROFILE HELPS MAKES OUR JOB A LITTLE BIT EASIER AS WE TRY TO COMMUNICATE AS WELL SO I JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU APPRECIATE IT. MISTER MARTINEZ MAY CONTINUE. GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH BOTH CULTURES HOLDEN AND GARCIA AND THANK YOU CULTURE HOLDING FOR YOUR ADJUSTER YOUR KNOWLEDGE MEANT RIGHT NOW AND IN SUPPORT OF THE COMMISSIONERS LEADERSHIP I WILL NOW BE ABLE TO PROVIDE MORE ON THAT- IMPORTANT DIVERSITY EQUITY AND INCLUSION WORK THAT WE'RE DOING AT THE DEPARTMENT UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF COMMISSIONER LARA. CURRENTLY THE DEPARTMENT'S DIVERSITY INITIATIVES COLLECTING. PUBLICLY DISSEMINATE INFORMATION ON CORPORATE BOARDS AND SUPPLY CHAIN DIVERSITY IN ADDITION TO. BE A COMMUNITY INVESTMENTS AND INSURANCE COMPANIES ALL OF WHICH WERE MADE POSSIBLE BECAUSE OF SUCCESSFUL LEAD LEGISLATION BACKED COMMISSIONER LOT OF SPONSORED SINCE COMING INTO OFFICE. AMONG THEM IN TWENTY TWENTY A NEW LAW WAS ENACTED WHICH EXPANDED OUR ABILITY TO COLLECT DATA ON HOW MUCH MONEY INSURANCE COMPANIES STAND WITH LGBTQ PLUS. AND THEN TURN OWN BUSINESSES MOM EXISTING CATEGORIES OF BUSINESSES SUCH AS THOSE OWNED BY WOMEN. DISABLED VETERANS AND PEOPLE OF COLOR. AS COMMISSIONER LOT OF MENTION WE ARE VERY PLEASED AND THRILLED IN FACT THAT GOVERNOR NEWSOM CIDER SPONSORED INSURANCE DIVERSITY BILL SB SIX FIFTY FIVE JUST A FEW DAYS AGO AMONG OTHER PROVISIONS THIS NEW LAW WILLBUILD UPON THE SUCCESS OF OUR DIVERSITY PRIORITIES. BY EXPANDING THE POOL OF INSURANCE COMPANIES REQUIRED TO REPORT ON THE DOLLARS SPENT WITH THE STATE'S DIVERSE BUSINESSES OR SUPPLIERS. I MISS BEING THAT IF THE COMPANIES ARE ABLE TO CALL TO COLLECT BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN PREMIUMS FROM CALIFORNIANS FROM CALIFORNIANS. AND IT'S ONLY FAIR THAT THEY ALSO CONTRACT. WITH A SMALL AND DIVERSE BUSINESSES BETTER BACKBONE OF OUR STATE'S ECONOMY. AND IT'S REALLY GOOD TO HEAR THAT OTHER STATE AGENCIES- THE ONES ESPECIALLY THAT SPOKE BEFORE US ABOUT THE WORK THAT THEY ARE ALSO DOING. I LOVE THE SYNERGY THAT HAPPENS WHEN WE ALL COME TOGETHER TOWARDS THE SHARED GOAL IT'S WHY THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE CO FOUNDED. THE STATEWIDE CALIFORNIA STATEWIDE COALITION FOR DIVERSITY INITIATIVES ALONGSIDE OTHER STATE AGENCIES INCLUDING THE DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. I'M GONNA TRANSPORTATION THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND OFFICES. HEALTH PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT. WE CREATED THIS COALITION BECAUSE TOGETHER OUR PURPOSE IS TO POOL OUR RESOURCES ARE BEST PRACTICES AND FIGURE OUT WAYS TO PROPEL MORE PROCUREMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR SMALL AND DIVERSE DIVERSE BUSINESSES. THESE EFFORTS REALLY ALIGNED WITH THE VISION AND GOALS OF OUR DEPARTMENTS DIVERSITY INITIATIVE. WE CREATE ANNUAL STRATEGIC PLANS IN PARTNERSHIP WITH OUR INSURANCE DIVERSITY TASK FORCE WHICH IS AN ADVISORY BODY OF THE COMMISSIONERS APPOINTEES COMPRISED OF COMMITTEE REPRESENTATIVES BUSINESS LEADERS AND INSURANCE INDUSTRY EXECUTIVES. IN THE FOR THE PANDEMIC IT WAS CRITICAL FOR COMMISSIONER A LOT OF TO SEE THAT INSURANCE COMPANIES CONTINUE TO REINVEST AND UP WITH THE COMMUNITIES THAT THEY DO BUSINESS AND- AT OUR DEPARTMENT. WE HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE SUPPLIER DIVERSITY LANDSCAPE WITHIN OUR STATE'S INSURANCE INDUSTRY BECAUSE WE LEGISLATED A LAW IN PARTNERSHIP WITH WITH YOU ALL THAT REQUIRES COMPANIES TO REPORT TO US. PUBLICLY BY EDITOR CALIFORNIA INSURANCE DIVERSITY SURVEY AND WE MAKE THE RESULTS OF OUR ANALYSIS PUBLICLY INSTRUCT ACCESSIBLE WE KNOW THAT TRANSPARENCY FEELS ACCOUNTABILITY. MANY INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE MULTI BILLION DOLLAR COMPANIES THAT EVEN ONE CONTRACT. FOR DIVERSE SMALL BUSINESS CAN BE LIFE CHANGING. IN TWENTY NINETEEN DIVERSE BUSINESSES COLLECTIVELY SUPPLIED TWO POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS A SIXTEEN POINT 7% INCREASE SINCE TWENTY EIGHTEEN IN GOODS AND SERVICES TO INSURANCE COMPANIES. WE ALSO KNOW THAT NEARLY HALF APPROXIMATELY 46% OF THOSE CONTRACTS WENT TO WOMEN BUSINESS ENTERPRISES. WELL LESS THAN A PERCENTAGE OF THOSE CONTRACTS WERE AWARDED TO BUSINESSES OWNED BY LGBTQ PLUS PEOPLE. SO ONE OF OUR GOALS HAS BEEN TO CREATE MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR DIVERSE SUPPLIERS TO MAN CONTRACTS WOULD CALIFORNIA'S INSURANCE COMPANIES WHICH WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO WITH A SERIES OF. BUSINESS MATCH MAKING IT AND CONNECTION EVENTS WHICH WE HOST OUR EFFORTS ARE HAVING A TANGIBLE IMPACT WE BELIEVE FOR CALIFORNIA'S DIVERSE BUSINESS OWNERS WELL PROCUREMENT FROM DIVERSE SUPPLIERS STILL DOESN'T REFLECT THE REALITY OF THE DIVERSE LANDSCAPE IN OUR STATE YET. THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY IS HEADED IN A POSITIVE DIRECTION FOR SUPPLIER DIVERSITY PROCUREMENT BUT STILL WE HAVE A WAYS TO GO. IN TWENTY TWENTY FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THE SPAN OF ITS OVER ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEAR HISTORY. THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS WHICH IS- THE NATION'S- ASSOCIATION OF CHIEF INSURANCE REGULATORS. FOR ALL FIFTY STATES PLUS UNITED STATES TERRITORIES WHICH COMMISSIONER LIVE IS A LEADING MEMBER. TREATED A SPECIAL EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE ON GRAYSON INSURANCE. TO FOCUS ON RACE AND DIVERSITY AND THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY. THEY'RE LOOKING TO CURTAIL DISCRIMINATORY PRACTICES IN ART IN THIS INDUSTRY TO CREATE POLICIES. THAT ARE MUCH FAIRER MORE INCLUSIVE. OUR DEPARTMENTS PROGRAMS TO ADVANCE DIVERSITY ARE BEING LOOKED UPON AS A NATIONAL MODEL AND BY THE SAME TOKEN WE ARE SEEING HOW EACH REGULATORS ACTIONS WITHIN THEIR RESPECTIVE STATE JURISDICTIONS. ARE CREATING A RIPPLE EFFECT ACROSS THIS INDUSTRY. AND KNOWING THAT THIS WORK IS A LONG TERM COMMITMENT COMMISSIONER A LOT OF REMAINS LASER FOCUSED. ON PUSHING FORWARD BOLD PUBLIC POLICIES THAT CENTER THE PRINCIPLES OF EQUITY. BUT MAKE NO MISTAKE WE CAN'T DO THIS ALONE AND IT'S GOING TO TAKE AN ENTIRE COMMUNITY OF LEADERS WE ARE COMMITTED TO. IN CHANGING THE STATUS QUO. NEXT FRIDAY AT OUR DEPARTMENT'S ANNUAL DIVERSITY SUMMIT COMMISSIONER LOTTO WILL BE HOSTING. EIGHT CONVERSATION WITH LEADERS. FROM NASDAQ INCLUDING ALSO CALIFORNIA'S SECRETARY OF STATE DR SHIRLEY WEBER TO DISCUSS. THE FUTURE OF BOARD DIVERSITY AND HOW CALIFORNIA'S LANDMARK MORE DIVERSITY LOS. HAVE ESSENTIALLY SHAPED THE LANDSCAPE OF NATIONAL POLICIES. DESPITE OUR COMMITMENTS IN THE STRIDES WERE MADE CALIFORNIA'S INSURANCE INDUSTRY NEEDS TO EVOLVE TO MEET THE EXPECTATIONS OF OUR CONSUMERS. LUCKILY FOR US HINDSIGHT IS TWENTY TWENTY VISION AND- AND BASED ON OUR WORK WE LEARN ABOUT WHAT STEPS WE SHOULD BE TAKING NOW AND WE HAVE A FEW. OF THOSE- OF THOSE STEPS THAT WE'RE TAKING ONE. SET MEASURABLE GOALS YOU CAN'T MEASURE WHAT YOU DON'T TRACK SO I GREW WITHOUT WHAT CO CHAIR GARCIA HAS STATED AND SHASTA INCLUDED PUBLICLY YOU CAN'T MEASURE WHAT YOU DON'T TRUST PUBLICLY. WE AGREE THANKS FOR NOTHING THERE'S PUBLIC POLICY MORE THAN DATA. AND WITHOUT DOUBT RELIABLE DATA IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND THE DISPARITIES THAT EXIST. THE DATA THAT WE OBTAIN FROM OUR DEPARTMENTS INSURANCE DIVERSITY SURVEY. CONTINUES TWENTY FOUR ARCHY PROGRAM AND POLICY INITIATIVES. SECONDLY SHARE RESOURCES FOR SUCCESS DESPITE YEARS OF COLLECTING DATA WE ARE STILL SEEING INSURANCE COMPANIES TELL US. THAT THEY SPEND NOTHING WHAT THE WHAT DRIVERS SUPPLIERS IN THE STATE. WHETHER IT'S THE RESULT OF THE REPORTING SYSTEMS ARE LACK OF INTENTIONALITY. THAT REMAINS TO BE SEEN BUT REGARDLESS WE ARE HERE TO HELP. AS WELL AS GUIDE AND PUSH. AS WE LOOK WILL BE WORKING WITH OUR DIVERSITY TASK FORCE. TO BRAINSTORM WORKABLE SOLUTIONS AND HOW TO HELP. AND PUSH INSURANCE COMPANIES TO MOVE BEYOND THE ZERO MARK AND TO THE SAME EXTENT CONTINUE WORKING WITH DIVERSE SUPPLIERS. ON ACCESSING. BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES WITH THESE COMPANIES. BUT I DO WANT TO A- HIGHLIGHT. THAT WE DID HAVE A WHOLE BOARD ENGAGEMENT CAMPAIGN WHERE COMMISSIONER LOT ISSUE THE CALL TO ACTION. TO INSURANCE COMPANY EXECUTIVES FOR THEIR OWN BOARDS TO SET INTERNAL GOALS TO ADD A DIVERSE BOARD DIRECTOR OR SHARE THEIR PLANS. TO DIVERSIFY AND WITHIN A TWELVE MONTH PERIOD 1100% OF THOSE INSURANCE COMPANIES CEOS RESPONDED- TOLD US THAT THEY HAD MADE OVER CLOSE TO MAKING PROGRESS WITH THOSE GOALS THAT WE SET OUT FOR THEM. CURRENTLY SUPPORT LONG TERM SOCIALLY RESPONSIBLE INVESTMENTS ONE OF THOSE MOVES IN DIFFERENT WAYS TO DIRECTLY IMPACT ONE'S ECONOMIC LIVELIHOOD IS THROUGH COMMITTEE INVESTMENTS THE PANDEMIC AS WE HAVE ALL SEEN HAS DEEPENED WELL DISPARITIES ACROSS OUR STATE. AS YOU MAY KNOW FIRMS OWNED BY WOMEN OR PEOPLE FROM HISTORICALLY UNDERREPRESENTED COMMUNITIES MANAGED LESS THAN ONE POINT 3% THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY SEVENTY TRILLION WITH A T. TRILLION IN ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT. AND JUST LAST YEAR JULY TWENTY TWENTY COMMISSIONER LARA ANNOUNCED A NEW INVEST IN OUR DIVERSE COMMUNITIES INITIATIVE AS PART OF OUR DEPARTMENTS ARE CALIFORNIA ORGANIZED INVESTMENT NETWORK PROGRAMS THAT WILL IDENTIFY WOMEN VETERANS LGBTQ PLUS. AND HISTORICALLY- UNDERREPRESENTED INVESTMENT MANAGERS LOOKING DIED SOCIALLY RESPONSIBLE INVESTMENTS OF INSURANCE COMPANIES TOWARDS CAPITAL READY ENFORCEABLE HOUSING. SMALL BUSINESS RECOVERY ENVIRONMENTAL PROJECTS ACROSS CALIFORNIA AND LASTLY WE NEED TO BUILD THE PLOT OF PIPELINE MUST STRENGTHEN OUR STATE'S COMMITMENT TO RECRUITING AND PROMOTING DIVERSE CANDIDATES THAT REFLECT OUR DIVERSITY AND PROVIDE THEM WITH PPORTUNITIES TO SUCCEED AT NEXT WEEK'S DIVERSITY SUMMIT WE WILL WE WILL BE HOSTING A WORKSHOP. ON PROPELLING TO PROPELLING DIVERSITY ONSTAGE ADVISORY BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS ALONGSIDE OUR APPOINTEE APPOINTMENTS CALLING FROM THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE THE CALIFORNIA STATE SENATE MITCHELL FROM ST SOMEBODY. SO IN CLOSING. WE HEAR THE DEPARTMENT UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF COMMISSIONER LARA- WE WANT TO SEE A CULTURAL SHIFT AND CALIFORNIA'S INSURANCE LANDSCAPE.

CLEARLY AS WE'RE LOOKING AT THE ISSUE OF PUBLIC SECTOR DIVERSITY- THERE'S ALWAYS A MORE OF A HIGHER BAR TO NAVIGATE THROUGH WITH THE ADVENT OF PROP TWO OH NINE AND SO WE APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT. LEADERSHIP WITHIN. THE GOVERNOR'S ADMINISTRATION- GIVES A KNOWLEDGE MEANT TO THE ISSUES OF DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND HIRING A DIVERSITY MANAGERS IS VERY IMPORTANT- FOCUSING ON IMPLICIT BIAS TRAINING IS VERY IMPORTANT SO WE APPRECIATE THAT KIND OF LEADERSHIP AND SO WAS THAT WAS BROUGHT OUT BY A NUMBER OF OUR PANELISTS TODAY WE WANT TO.

THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE AND WILL TURN TO YOU NOW FOR YOUR PRESENTATION. NO WORRIES AT ALL THANK YOU SO MUCH ASSEMBLY MEMBER HOLDEN AND ALSO LIKE TO THANK ASSEMBLYMEMBER GARCIA AND THE SELECT- MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. FOR THIS TIME BOB. ACTUALLY THE PRESENTATION AT DO YOU WANT TO SHARE BUT BASICALLY IT'S MY INTENTION TO PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF WHAT ABLY. ASK MARTIN BOARD LEADERSHIP INSTITUTE WHAT WE DO AND HOW WE'RE RESPONDING TO OUR NATIONAL CALL TO ACTION RECOGNIZING A CALIFORNIA'S LEADING THE WAY WITH THE RECENT PASSAGE OF EIGHTY NINE SEVENTY NINE. I ALSO WANT TO SHARE HER ORGANIZATION CAN HELP TO CREATE A PIPELINE OF AFTERMARKET PROFESSIONALS TRAINED BY US WHAT GOVERNANCE. IF WE CAN GO TO SLIDE NUMBER TWO PLEASE. I'LL SKIP CHRISTMAS LIGHTS. NEXT. ONE AND THE NEXT LOOK. OKAY SO I MISSION IS QUITE SIMPLE OUR GOAL IS TO STRENGTHEN NONPROFIT PUBLIC AND PRIVATE ORGANIZATIONS TO RECRUITING AND PREPARING AND ASSISTING WITH THE PLACEMENT OF AFRICAN AMERICANS ON A BROAD RANGE OF GOVERNING BOARD SO WE DO THE SCHOOL CORPORATIONS WE DO IT FOR FOUNDATIONS WE DO IT FOR GOVERNMENT COMMISSIONS- ABLY WAS ESTABLISHED OVER A DECADE AGO WHICH SETS US APART FROM A NUMBER OF ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE POPPING UP WE'VE SEEN. THE ADVENT ROMANIZATIONS AFTER A MASTECTOMY THIS PROPOSAL TO THE SEC ORGANIZATIONS ARE HAVE BEEN LOOKING TO DO RECRUITMENT RETENTION BUT WITH THE AFRICAN AMERICAN BOARD LEADERSHIP INSTITUTE WE ARE AND DECADE TO OF SERVICE. I'M SORRY I'M OUR SECOND DECADE OF SERVICE. AND THERE'S A LEVEL OFTEN THAT COMES WITH THAT THAT'S A LEVEL OF TRUST WERE HIGHLY RESPECTED BASED IN LOS ANGELES CALIFORNIA WE WORK WITH A NUMBER OF CORPORATIONS. FOUNDATIONS AND THEN GOVERNMENT ENTITIES SO WE WERE FOUNDED BY VIRGIL ROBERTS AND YOU BETCHA INGRAM IN A GROUP OF CONCERNED CITIZENS WHO HAD SERVED ON BOARDS THEY SERVE ON BOARDS. THEY HAVE SERVED AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF NONPROFIT AND PHILANTHROPIC AND PHILANTHROPY THEY WERE EXECUTIVES AND THEY SAW THE NEED FOR THIS ORGANIZATION TO EXIST A DECADE AGO. BECAUSE OF THE UNDER REPRESENTATION OF AFRICAN AMERICANS ON GOVERNING BOARDS NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. SO OVER THE LAST DECADE WE'VE TRAINED OVER EIGHT HUNDRED PROFESSIONALS TO SERVE ON GOVERNING BOARDS EVEN IMPACT ABOUT TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND OFFICIALS THROW PROGRAMMING. AND MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED CURRENTLY SERVE ON NONPROFIT BOARDS WHEN GOVERNMENT COMMISSIONS AND ALSO ON OUR CORPORATE BOARDS NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. SO ABLY IS OUR PIONEERING IN THIS REGARD WE'VE EXPANDED OUR OPERATIONS NATIONALLY WE'RE ENTERING THE SECOND DECADE OF SERVICE AS I'VE MENTIONED WE'RE COMMITTED TO PROVIDING RESOURCES AND SERVICES TO CORPORATIONS SO THAT THEY CAN MEET THE MANDATE THAT SPINS. BEFORE DOWN BY EIGHTY NINE SEVENTY NINE SO WE PROVIDE SOLUTIONS AND TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES FOR CORPORATIONS WE DO IT FOR GRANT MAKERS AND FOR NON PROFITS AND GOVERNMENT ENTITIES AND- REALLY THE FUTURE OF DIVERSITY IS ABOUT THESE PARTNERSHIPS AND SOLUTIONS WITH AN ORGANIZATION LIKE. EBELING NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. SO WE TAKE THIS AS WE SEE THIS AS A- AN ACTIVE ROLE IN ANSWERING THE NATION'S CALL TO ACTION WE HAVE BEEN WILL BE. CONTENT TO BE A PART OF THIS MOVEMENT FOR CHANGE WHAT THE RISE OF SOCIAL UNREST IN TWENTY TWENTY MANY CORPORATIONS WERE FORCED TO STATE THEIR SUPPORT FOR DIVERSITY WITH THEIR WITHIN THEIR ORGANIZATIONS. EMILY WAS ONLY PLANTED AND ITS WORK TO BRING ABOUT CHANGE SO OUR DIVERSITY ACCORDING TO SOME THIS WORK PROVIDES CONFIRMATION OF WHAT RESEARCHERS THAT'S PERFECT YOU KNOW OUR BACK. ON BUSINESS RECENT PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR SOCIAL JUSTICE MOVEMENTS DOESN'T ALWAYS TRANSLATE INTO LONG TERM STRUCTURAL CHANGE CAN BOARD MEMBERS HIRING AND RECRUITMENT RETENTION POLICIES THAT'S. WHERE OUR WORK COMES TO PLAY. NEXT LIKE WEEKS. WHAT WE SKIP TO. GO UP A FEW SLIDES. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. WELCOME TO SLIDE NUMBER. EIGHT SO THIS IS KEY BECAUSE EXACTLY ONE YEAR AGO THE GOVERNMENT ISN'T SIGNED LANDMARK LEGISLATION WHICH REQUIRES DIVERSITY ON CORPORATE BOARDS- WE'RE CERTAINLY APPRECIATIVE FOR THE VISION ASSEMBLY MEMBER HOLDEN ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA ASSEMBLY MEMBER DAVID CHIU AND US NUMBER- RACE AND ALSO SENATOR BEN YOU STILL FOR CO AUTHORING. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. NETWORK. SO IS A SINGLE ASCO CALIFORNIA YOU KNOW SO DO DOES THE REST OF THE COUNTRY AND WE'VE SEEN WHAT'S HAPPENING- BASED UPON THIS VISIONARY LEADERSHIP SEEMS STATES LIKE ILLINOIS AND WASHINGTON AND HAWAII AND MASSACHUSETTS AND OTHERS OR FOLLOWING CALIFORNIA'S LEAD BUT THERE'S STILL MORE WORK TO BE DONE NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. SO THE FUTURE FOR DIVERSITY AS WE SEE IT ABLY IS HOW WE HELP CORPORATIONS ACHIEVE THIS MANDATE THIS LAW THAT'S BEEN SET BEFORE THEM AND WE BELIEVE IT'S STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIPS WITH. JEFF MARTIN WE SHOULD INSTITUTE NEXT SLIDE. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. SO WHAT I LIKE TO SHARE SOME OF OUR PROGRAMMING AND HOW WE HELP CORPORATIONS ARE SIGNATURE PROGRAM IS THE BOARD LEADERSHIP PROGRAM AND WE TRAINING- INDIVIDUALS ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY THE PROGRAMMING IS DONE VIRTUALLY NOW DUE TO COLDER IRATE SAP THROUGH THE LAST COHORT OF INDIVIDUALS WHO CAME THROUGH- OUR PLP PROGRAMMING IN AUGUST AND- IT'S A RIGHT TO HEAR THE STORIES THAT CORPORATIONS AND FOUNDATIONS AND- GOVERNMENT EMISSIONS CAN'T FIND QUALIFIED PEOPLE OF COLOR I WITNESSED FORTY EIGHT PEOPLE. WHO WENT TO THE PROGRAM IN AUGUST THERE WERE DOCTORS LAWYERS P. H. D.'S NBA'S ALWAYS FAN CALIFORNIA AND ALL AROUND THE COUNTRY INDIVIDUALS WHAT SERVED ON BOARDS INDIVIDUALS WHO HAD NOT SO YOU REALLY CREATE A SPECIFIC TRAINING PROGRAM BECAUSE THERE'S- JUST BECAUSE WHAT WORKS FOR MAJOR CORPORATIONS OR- ISN'T EXACTLY WITHIN A MAJOR FOUNDATION DOES NOT MAKE THEM QUALIFIED TO SERVE ON THE BOARD HOWEVER HAVING THE TRAINING AND LEADERSHIP FROM. CULTURALLY COMPETENT LEADERS WHO HAVE SERVED ON BOARDS AND THROUGH THE CURRICULUM AND TRAINING THAT WAS DEVELOPED WITH OUR FACULTY WELCOME TO MEET THOSE. NEEDS NEXT MARKETS. ONE OF OTHER PRO IS ALREADY LEADERS SERIES. AND WE ARE WITH OVER THE FOR ARE PROFESSOR DEVELOPMENT FOR INDIVIDUALS TO GO THROUGH A BORN LEADERSHIP PROGRAMS WORKSHOPS AND FORUMS AND EVENTS. AND LIFELONG LEARNING FOR ALL MEMBERS OF OUR ALUMNI NETWORK NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. WE HAVE A CORPORATE DIRECTORS INITIATIVE WHICH IS WEBINARS ARE ONLINE RIGHT NOW ON YOUR COLD BUT THEY'RE PACKED WITH INSIDER PERSPECTIVES THAT CAN HELP INDIVIDUAL BOARD MEMBERS- WHO ARE INTERESTED IN THE CORPORATE BOARD. JOIN THOSE BOARDS WITH CONFIDENCE WITH THE SUPPORT THAT THEY NEED TO HAVE BUT TALKING CHECK OTHER. BOARD MEMBERS NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. WE ALSO HAVE A PUBLIC BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS WARM- ASSEMBLY MEMBER HOLDERS PARTICIPATE IN ONE OF THOSE AND BASS WE USE THAT AS OPPORTUNITIES TO ENGAGE COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND- THE VARIOUS APPOINTMENTS THAT MIGHT GET A LITTLE DOWN AFTER PURSUE CORPORATE BOARD SO WE HAVE BETTER COMMISSIONERS. WILL SHARE THEIR INSIGHTS AND TO TALK ABOUT HOW YOU CAN BECOME MEMBERS OF PUBLIC BOARDS NEXT MONTH'S. SO THERE'S VERY SPECIFIC THINGS THAT ABLE IS GOING TO WORK WITH CORPORATIONS SO WE BELIEVE THAT THERE IS- WE PROVIDE A SOLUTION THAT'S NEEDED FOR CORPORATIONS TO. BEGIN TO DO THIS WORK AND ALSO TO HAVE BEEN NUMBERS OF TEENS LIKE TO. DEBATE WHAT SHE NEXT LOGS. SO ONE EXAMPLE OF OUR WORK IS A PARTNERSHIP WITH TOYOTA WOULD BE DEVELOP CUSTOMIZED TRAINING FOR TOYOTA TO- TRAINS MOTHER CORPORATE EXECS ANDALSO FOR SOME OF THEIR MID CAREER STAFF INTEREST THEIR C. SUITE EXECS SO THAT THEY COULD SERVE ON- BOARDS AND THEY COULD SERVE. SERVE ON NONPROFIT BOARDS IN THE COMMUNITIES OF THEIR SERVICE SO WE DO IT WITH CORPORATIONS FOR NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS BUT FOR THEIR AT THEIR FOUNDATIONS AND THEIR THEIR- THEIR ORGANIZATIONS UP THERE SERVE WITHIN THEIR RESPECTIVE COMMUNITIES. ONE OF WHICH WAS A TRAINING THAT WE CREATED FOR TOYOTA BECAUSE NOBLE CORPORATION IS EXACTLY THIS THING YOU KNOW THERE'S DIFFERENT CULTURE WITHIN EACH ORGANIZATION SO WE CREATE CUSTOMER TRAININGS. TO SUPPORT. NEXT LIVES. ANOTHER OF OUR WORK IN TERMS OF DIVERSITY ACCORDING INCLUSIVENESS IS A PARTNERSHIP WITH THE WEINGART FOUNDATION SO- WEINGART FOUNDATION. IS A PIONEER OR LEADER IN THE SCHOOL BECAUSE THEY TOLD ORIGINAL GRANTEE THAT THEY WOULD NOT FUND THEM UNLESS THEY HAVE DIVERSE BOARDS SO DIVERSITY STARTS AT THE TOP SO WE WENT AND- TO TRAIN WIDER ITS GRANTEES SO THAT THEIR BOARDS COULD BECOME. MORE DIVERSE AND SO THEY CAN RECRUIT AND RETAIN- INDIVIDUALS TO SERVE ON A NONPROFIT BOARD. NEXT LEXUS. AGAIN ACCORDING TO SHIP PROGRAM WHICH THREE WEEKS INTENSIVE FOR. CHECK PLACE ON SINCE. COURTS MEET THEY REVIEW CASE STUDIES BY TALK WITH ACTUAL- ARE SITTING BOARD MEMBERS THEY DISCUSS ISSUES LIKE IMPLICIT BIAS YOU KNOW YOU LESION. OR DOES IT LEADERSHIP AND THINGS THAT WOULD NOT ACTUALLY COME UP THEY HAVE NOT GOING TO A SPECIFIC TRAINING THAT WAS CREATED FOR THEM SO. IT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE BELIEVE IS KEY TO NOT ONLY HAVE COMPLEX WELL IF I WAS WITH THE TRAINING AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE READY. SO THAT'S THAT'S WHAT. MAKES US. DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT DIFFERENT FROM OTHER ORGANIZATIONS. NO SLIDE SO. I TALKED NUMBER CUSTOMIZING YOUR TWENTY FOUR REALIZATION- IT'S A WITNESS ABOUT HOW DO WE EVEN TACKLE POSITION SO WE TRAINED EMPLOYEE RESOURCE GROUPS RETRAINING C. SUITE EXECS TRAIN OUR MID LEVEL STAFF SO WHATEVER THE REASON NEEDS CAN CREATE THAT PROGRAMMING FOR THEM WE HAVE A STANDARDIZED TRAINING AND CUSTOMIZED TRAINING SECOND STEP WITH THE NEEDS OF ANY ORGANIZATION SO IT'S ONE OF THE WAYS THAT WE'RE LOOKING TO IMPACT BE DIVERSITY EQUITY INCLUSIVENESS AMONGST ORGANIZATIONS IT'S ONE OF THE WAYS THAT WE LOOK AT. ELEVATING LEADERSHIP YOU KNOW LEADERSHIP IT GOES BOTH WAYS SO THE MID LEVEL STAFF- MANAGERS DIRECTORS VICE PRESIDENTS C. SUITE STAFF- STREAMS ALL AROUND THAT'S AVAILABLE TO ANY CORPORATION. AND NEEDS. NEXT LOOKS. BOB PRESSURE THE COST. WORKSHOPS ONE RESOURCE MADE WORK WITH- BLACK AMERICANS A RESOURCE GROUPS ONCOLOGY B. G. Q. RESOURCE GROUPS HELPING THEM TO- DISCUSSED ISSUES WITHIN THEIR ORGANIZATIONS AND TO CREATE MORE DIVERSE COMMUNITIES IN A MORE DIVERSE WORK ENVIRONMENT. EXCELLENT WE DO BOARD GOVERNANCE TRAINING AND THIS REALLY HELPS TO FOCUS ON SPECIFIC ISSUES THAT ARE NEEDED FOR BORDER CITY SUCCESSFUL IN THEIR ENDEAVORS AND THEIR WORK AS MORE MEMBERS. MECKLER SAID. SURE YOU DO BUT IT'S WHAT TRAINS FOR MID CAREER DEVELOPMENT- IF WE'RE OUT TO DEVELOPING THE TRAINING AS LEADERS NEXT LINE. AND WHAT'S WHAT'S REALLY KEY IS OUR BOARD RECRUITMENT PLACEMENT SO- FOR THESE BILLS INDIVIDUALS THAT WE TRAIN WE PLACED THEM ON ACTUAL BOARDS SO ABLY NOW HAS A PARTNERSHIP WITH NASDAQ NASDAQ LOOKS TO- FOR THAT. REASON THE OLDEST ON THE NASDAQ WHEN THEY HAVE OPENINGS FOR DIFFERENT WELL- BOARD LEADERSHIP OPPORTUNITIES BAY SURE THAT WITH US WE SHARE OUR BORDERING TALENT TO HELP THEM TO RECRUIT AND RETAIN INDIVIDUAL SO AGAIN IT'S MORE ABOUT A RESOURCE IN PARTNERSHIP AND THAT'S HOW WE LOOK TO THE FUTURE TO SUPPORT NOT ONLY CORPORATIONS BUT FOUNDATIONS AND- OTHER ENTITIES. NEXT LAB TO. AND THAT BRINGS TO THE END OF MY PRESENTATION TRY TO RUN THROUGH A VERY QUICKLY AND- YOU HAVE TO KEEPING. HELLO MY- UP. BUT WHAT HI SCHEDULE SO IF THE I PUT IS ON THINGS IT AND- THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME WE THANK YOU AND WE DO A- THE- SHORT END OF THE PRESENTATION BUT THE- THE ESSENCE OF WHAT YOU ARE PRESENTING. WAS STILL VERY RICH AND VERY INFORMATIVE AND SO IT'S APPRECIATIVE THAT. THAT THAT WAS PRETTY LAID OUT THERE IN A WAY THAT I THINK IT MAKES IT HELPFUL TO UNDERSTAND THE VALUE THAT YOUR ORGANIZATION IS BRINGING TO BUILDING THE PIPELINE AND I THINK THAT WAS PART OF THE FOCUS OF YOUR PRESENTATION AND WE SEE THAT AND WE- LOOK FORWARD TO BRING YOU BACK AND DRAWING ON YOU AS A RESOURCE AS WE- CONTINUE TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES IN A COLLABORATIVE WAY GOING FORWARD. WE'RE GOING TO INTRODUCE OUR OUR LOT BUT WE HAVE ONE MORE WE HAVE ONE MORE. PRESENTER IN THIS PANEL- AND THEN WLL RESERVE SOME TIME FOR A FEW QUESTIONS AT THE CONCLUSION. OF THE NEXT WE SHIFT OUR ATTENTION TO THE LEGAL CONCERNS AROUND INSTITUTING DIVERSITY INCLUSION POLICIES OR DENY POLICIES IN THE WORKPLACE PROFESSOR HANNAH. SHAW FROM GOLDEN STATE UNIVERSITY WILL ADDRESS SOME OF THE LEGAL CONCERNS AROUND D. AND I POLICIES AND WILL DISCUSS HER PAPER. A RADICAL RECONSTRUCTION. RE EMBRACING AFFIRMATIVE ACTION AND PRIVATE EMPLOYMENT. PROFESSOR HANNAH SHAW IS PROFESSOR OF LAW AND DIRECTOR OF WOMEN'S IN EMPLOYMENT RIGHTS CLINIC. AT GOLDEN STATE UNIVERSITY LAW SCHOOL W. E. R. C. ADVOCATES FOR THE RIGHTS OF LOW WAGE IMMIGRANT WORKERS THROUGH DIRECT SERVICE IMPACT LITIGATION AND PUBLIC POLICY WORK AND IN COORDINATION WITH COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS. IT ALSO SERVES AS LEGAL COUNSEL. TO THE CALIFORNIA DOMESTIC WORKERS COALITION HELPING EXPAND AND ENFORCE WORK PLACE PROTECTIONS FOR DOMESTIC WORKERS PROFESSOR SHAW HAS LECTURED AND WRITTEN ON THE PLIGHT OF LOW WAGE AND IMMIGRANT WORKERS HER SCHOLARSHIP FOCUSES ON EXPLORING THE RADICAL RACIAL. STRATIFICATION OF THE LABOR. ELECTED YOU FOR SHAW JOIN US TODAY AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO PRESENT. THANK VERY MUCH MEMBERS HOLDEN AND COURSE AND FOR THE MEMBERS IN SPECIAL OF THE COMMITTEE. HI I HAVE LAW BEEN INTERESTED IN THE DIVERSITY OF THE WAY WORK FORCE FOR ME THROUGH MY WORK AT THE CLINIC AT GOLDEN GATE UNIVERSITY WILL ALSO THROUGHOUT MY CAREER I HAVE REPRESENTED LOW WAGE WORKERS. AND IT IS NOT SURPRISING HAT WOMEN AND PEOPLE OF COLOR ARE OVER REPRESENTED IN LANGUAGE IN DISTRICTS. IN MY SCHOLARSHIP AND MY PUBLIC SPEAKING I HAVE BECOME INTERESTED IN ADDRESSING THE RACIAL STRATIFICATION OF THE LABOR MARKET AND TO FIND SOLUTIONS TO TRULY DIVERSIFY. GOVERNMENT HAS LONG RECOGNIZED THAT WITHOUT DISCRIMINATION EMPLOYERS WORKFORCE SHOULD REFLECT THE PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION ALONG RACE AND GENDER. WORKFORCE SO IT'S NOT JUST A PROBLEM OF REPRESENTATION AT BOARD LEVEL. BUT IT SHOULD BE REFLECTED THROUGHOUT THE LABOR MARKET. WE KNOW THAT RACIAL DISCRIMINATION BOTH HISTORICALLY AND THE CURRENT RIPPLE EVIDENCE WE KNOW THAT THERE IS DISCRIMINATION IN THE LABOR MARKET BOTH OVERT AND IMPLICIT. DISCRIMINATION ALL AND IT IS STILL VERY PROMINENT. NORTH PURPLE STUDIES HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT DISCRIMINATION AGAINST BLACKS IS NOT DISAPPEAR OR EVEN GRADUAL DIMENSION DIMINISHING LABOR MARKET. IN FACT IN ONE STUDY A WHITE MALE FELON OUT ON PAROLE AT A HIGHER CHANCE OF GETTING EMPLOYMENT THAN A BLACK MALE WITH NO PROBLEM. I WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT AFFIRMATIVE ACTION BUT ALSO TO EXPAND THE COMMITTEES UNDERSTANDING ABOUT THE CHALLENGES ON BET. ON READING AFFIRMATIVE ACTION IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR IS GOING TO. APPRECIATE DURING WARTIME THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PROHIBITED DISCRIMINATION IN TRAINING AND VOCATIONAL PROGRAMS IN DEFENCE PRODUCTION BY PRIVATE DEFENSE CONTRACTORS. PRESIDENT KENNEDY IN NINETEEN SIXTY ONE EXPANDED THE PROHIBITION ON DISCRIMINATION BY MAKING THE FIRST EXPLICIT REFERENCE TO AFFIRMATIVE ACTION WHEN HE MANDATED THAT FEDERAL CONTRACTORS TAKE AFFIRMATIVE ACTION TO ENSURE EQUAL OPPORTUNITY. THAT'S AFFIRMATIVE ACTION MANDATE REMAINS INTACT TODAY MOST FEDERAL CONTRACTORS MUST ADOPT AFFIRMATIVE ACTION PLANS WITH DETAILED STATISTICAL AND NARRATIVE COMPONENTS FOR EXAMPLE COMPARING THE UTILIZATION OF WOMEN AND PEOPLE OF COLOR TO THEIR AVAILABILITY IN THE MARKET. AND DEVELOPING RECRUITMENT OUTREACH EFFORTS TO ADDRESS THESE DEFICIENCIES. WHAT DOES NOT REQUIRE VOTERS IT DOES REQUIRE DESIGNING GOALS TIMETABLES AND PRIMITIVE ACTION COMMITMENTS TO CORRECT ANY IDENTIFIABLE DEFICIENCY. SPECIFIC STUDIES OF THE FOUNDER FEDERAL MANDATE ON AFFIRMATIVE ACTION AND CONCLUDED THAT THE PROGRAM WORKS SUBSTANTIALLY TO INCREASE BLACK AND FEMALE EMPLOYMENT AND CONTRACTING FOR. BUT THIS PROGRESS WAS SHORT. CALIFORNIA BECAME THE FIRST STATE THE PASSAGE OF PROPOSITION TWO OH NINE TO BAN THE USE OF PREFERENTIAL TREATMENT BASED ON RACE OR GENDER IN PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT PUBLIC EDUCATION AND PUBLIC CONTRACT. THIS CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT STILL STANDS TODAY. IN A PRIVATE EMPLOYMENT SECTOR THE PORT HAS GRAPPLED WITH THE A COLOR BLIND SOCIETY BUT THE HISTORICAL HISTORICAL REALITY OF RACE THE SUBJUGATION. MANY OF THE PORTS DOCTRINAL DECISIONS ON AFFIRMATIVE ACTION ARE FRACTURED AND DOCTRINALLY UNSTABLE. DESPITE THE IDEOLOGICAL PUNCTUATION THE WORD AND THE LACK OF A MAJORITY SINCE THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES THE COURT HAS UPHELD THE USE OF RACE IN NARROW CIRCUMSTANCES INCLUDING AN EDUCATION TO CREATE OR MAINTAIN DIVERSITY. AND BY PRIVATE EMPLOYERS IN DESIGNING VOLUNTARY AFFIRMATIVE ACTION PROGRAMS. TODAY HOWEVER WE MUST PROCEED WITH CAUTION IN PRESCRIBING REYES OR GENDER CONSCIOUS DECISION MAKING AS THE ONLY SOLUTION TO ENSURING A DIVERSE WORK. THE MAKE UP OF THE HIGH COURT IS DRASTICALLY DIFFERENT THAN EVEN A DECADE AGO. AND JUSTICE ROBERTS ALONG WITH THE CONSERVATIVE WING OF THE SUPREME COURT ARE STAUNCH OPPONENTS OF AFFIRMATIVE ACTION. I FEAR THAT ANY CASE THAT WILL END UP BEFORE THE COURT MAYBE AN INVITATION FOR THE WORK OF FINALLY AND THE CONSIDERATION OF RACE AND GENDER DECISION. RECENT DECISIONS ON VOTING RIGHTS IN OTHER AREAS CLEARLY POINT TO THE COURTSWHEN HE HAS TO ABANDON PRECEDENT. IN IMPACT MOVEMENTS OF THE ONE DIRECTION. HOWEVER THERE ARE STILL OPPORTUNITIES FOR THIS COMMITTEE AND THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER. WHAT AREA OF OPPORTUNITY WITH RESPECT TO AFFIRMATIVE ACTION IS IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR. TOTAL SEVEN DOES NOT MANDATE AFFIRMATIVE ACTION BUT IT ALSO DOES NOT PROHIBIT. FURTHERMORE PROPOSITION TWO OH NINE DOES NOT DEAL WITH PRIVATE EMPLOYMENT. I'M MULTIPLE OCCASIONS THE FEDERAL THE U. S. SUPREME COURT HAS REINFORCED THE ABILITY FIVE EMPLOYERS TO ADOPT NARROWLY TAILORED VOLUNTARY AFFIRMATIVE ACTION PLANS. THE KEY IS FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO INCENTIVIZE COMPANIES THROUGH TAX CREDITS OR OTHER FINANCIAL INCENTIVES TO ADOPT AFFIRMATIVE ACTION. TO END TO ADOPT A PLAN THAT WORKS WITH A DIVERSE AND INCLUSIVE WORK. WE HEARD FROM A LOT OF THE PUBLIC SECTOR ALL LEADERS INCLUDING MISS JENKINS JOHNSON THE SHALL ABOUT THE PUBLIC SECTOR'S COMMITMENT TO CREATING A COMPREHENSIVE DIVERSITY PLAN. WE NEED TO ENCOURAGE PRIVATE EMPLOYERS TO SUMMARY ADOPTED COMPREHENSIVE D. I. PLAN INCLUDING ALL WHERE THERE ARE. THERE'S A TRAIT DESPITE WHAT DOES A PIPELINE THAT'S GREAT AT ALL AS WELL AS WE- READ. LOOKING AT THE ENTIRE PROCESS ON GROUP TRULY CREATED DIVERSITY IN THE WORK. WHAT THE LEGISLATURE COULD WORK TOWARDS CREATING A DIVERSE AND INCLUSIVE WORKFORCE BY FUNDING TRAINING PROGRAMS OR INCENTIVIZING ON THE JOHN TRAINING BENEFITS IN CERTAIN INDUSTRIES WHERE THERE ARE RACIAL GENDER DISPARITIES. BUT I ALSO URGE THE COMMITTEE TO NOT THINK START LEADING A BINARY FASHION. THE CHOICE IS NOT BETWEEN COLOR OR GENDER BLINDNESS AND RECOVERING TREATMENT. IN EQUITY PERMEATES EVERY OF THE EMPLOYMENT RELATIONS FOR RECRUITMENT RETURN TO PROMOTION TO SUCH. AFFIRMATIVE ACTION WE JUST COMES AT THE TAIL END TO FORCE A CHOICE BASED ON RACE OR GENDER. HOWEVER WE NEED TO EMBRACE AND MANDATE THAT EMPLOYERS ELIMINATE ALL THE- EXPLICIT AND IMPLICIT IN THE PROCESS TO TRULY DIVERSIFY THEIR WORK. I THINK THE ONLY- JANET WANTS I'LL INDIVISIBLE GARCIA DECIMATED ATTENDED TO THIS COMMENT BUT I AGREE WHAT GET WHAT GETS MEASURED PROBABLY GETS DONE. SO FOR EXAMPLE. COMPANIES CAN ADOPT WRITTEN STATEMENTS OF COMMITMENTS TO DIVERSITY INCLUSION AND EQUITY AND MAKE THOSE STATEMENTS PUBLIC ALL OF THE STATEMENTS SHOULD INCLUDE ADOPTIONS A COMPANY WIDE HIRING GOALS TO ADDRESS ANY INEQUITIES. AND A COMMITMENT TO REDUCE UNCONSCIOUS BIAS AND STRUCTURAL BARRIERS. THERE'S MUCH MORE ACCOUNTABILITY THAT COMPANIES NEED TO DO TO ADDRESS EXISTING RACE OR GENDER WAGE AND OCCUPATIONAL DISPARITIES. DISPARITIES THAT CAN BE REVEALED BY THE PAY DATA REPORTS THAT ARE REQUIRED BY SB NINE SEVENTY THREE. THOSE REPORTS SHOULD BE MADE PUBLIC REQUIRING EMPLOYERS TO POST THE DATA ON THE PUBLIC WEBSITES. WHERE TO THE DMV EACH POST A SEARCHABLE DATABASE THAT REMOVES ANY INDIVIDUALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION. SB NINE SEVEN THREE SHOULD ALSO BE EXPANDED TO APPLY TO PRIVATE EMPLOYERS WITH FIFTY OR MORE TO AGGREGATE P. DATA BASED ON RACE. GENDER AND OTHER IDENTIFIABLE. CATEGORIES MISTER JONES ONE ZERO COPPER CAL MANDATORY CORRECT TO LOOK TO REDUCE IMPLICIT BIAS I THINK THIS COMMITTEE AND LEGISLATURE CAN REALLY THINK ABOUT MANDATING REQUIREMENTS ON THAT ENCOMPASS DIVERSITY EQUITY AND INCLUSION THE LEGISLATURE ALREADY MANDATES ARE PRIVATE EMPLOYERS TO HAVE SEXUAL HARASSMENT TRAINING FOR THEIR SUPERVISORS BUT WE NEED EVEN MORE SO ALL IN TERMS OF PROVIDING TRAINING IN THE LEADERSHIP TO ELEVATE DIVERSITY EQUITY INCLUSION THROUGHOUT. A PRIVATE EMPLOYERS WITH. MORE FOCUS NEEDS TO BE PLACED ON ENSURING A DIVERSE APPLICANT WILL BOTHER THEM FOCUSING SOLELY ON THE ACTUAL DECISION. THIS MUST DO THE HARD WORK OF EVALUATING ITS ENTIRE EMPLOYMENT PROCESS FROM IDENTIFYING HIRING NEEDS TO PROMOTION AND RETENTION. BIAS CREATES BARRIERS TO WALK ACROSS. THE PAINSTAKING STEPS OF EVALUATING AND LAMINATING BIAS IN EVERY STEP OF THE PROCESS WILL RESULT IN A MORE DIVERSE APPLICANT POOL. WHEN SETTING MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THE WOMEN ARE RELUCTANT TO APPLY TO JOBS AND WHEN THEY DO NOT MEET 100% OF TE HIRING CRITERIA. BUSINESSES SHOULD THINK CAREFULLY ABOUT WHICH SKILLS A PERSON NEEDS TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN THAT POSITION. OUR ANTI DISCRIMINATION LAWS COULD ALSO BE CLEAR ON WHAT INFORMATION BUSINESS CAN GATHER FROM JOB APPLICANTS TO ENSURE THAT THE APPLICANT POOL IS DIVERSE AND INCLUDES. CURRENTLY THE LAW REQUIRES THAT DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY IT IS UNLAWFUL TO IDENTIFY AN INDIVIDUAL ON THE BASIS OF THE ENUMERATING ENUMERATED CATEGORIES ALL IT'S ON WALL. HOWEVER IT'S NOT A MORE. ELECT A VOLUNTARY BASIS APPLICANTS WILL DATA AND OTHER RECORD KEEPING DATA FOR STATISTICAL PURPOSES. THE DATA CAN BE USED TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE APPLICANT WAS DIVERTS MORE THOUGHT NEEDS TO BE- SPENT BY THE LEGISLATURE I'M THINKING ABOUT WHAT KIND OF DATA CAN AN EMPLOYEE REVIEWS TO EVALUATE WHETHER THEY HAVE TRULY A DIVERSE APPLICANTS. THESE ARE JUST SOME SUGGESTIONS THE BUSINESSES IN THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD EXPLORE TO ENSURE THE CALIFORNIA'S WORKFORCE REFLECTS THE TRUE DIVERSITY OF ITS POPULATION. I THINK THAT THERE'S A LOT TO BE LEARNED BOTH FIGHT STEPS TO THE PRIVATE EMPLOYERS HAVE TAKEN. ACCEPT ORDERS TAKEN AND ALSO BY THE LEGISLATURES ARE. FOCUSING ON COMMITMENT TO CREATING A TRULY DIVERSE AND INCLUSIVE WORKFORCE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR INVITING. THANK YOU. WE WILL NOW. TURN TO MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- TO SEE IF THERE ANY QUESTIONS BUT IF I COULD JUST VERY QUICKLY ON THAT LAST POINT THAT YOU RAISED AROUND THE PUBLIC SECTOR- WORKFORCE AND LOOKING AT WAYS OF CREATING GREATER. DIVERSITY WE DO HAVE A BILL. I AB ONE OH FIVE THAT IS BEFORE THE GOVERNOR FOR SIGNATURE THAT LOOKS AT UPWARD MOBILITY. FOR WOMEN AND- INDIVIDUALS OF COLOR OF WHO ARE LOOKING TO MOVE UP WITHIN ORGANIZATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES ADDRESSING THE ISSUE IS YOU TO CHRIS THESCRIBE OF ELIMINATING. BIAS IN THE RECRUITING POOL- BUT ALSO SITTING IN PLACE. A CLEAR STANDARD OF HOW THERE COULD BE AN OPPORTUNITY TO EVALUATE PEOPLE BASED ON WHAT. THEIR TRUE TALENTS ARE AND GIVING THEM THE OPPORTUNITY TO MOVE UP AND NOT HAVING ANYTHING THAT WOULD SORT OF FILTER THEM OUT BECAUSE IT MAYBE DIDN'T CHECK A CERTAIN BOX. OF BASED ON A CERTAIN EDUCATIONAL STANDARD BUT THEY MAY BE WORK FIFTEEN TO TWENTY YEARS. FOR THE CIVIL SERVICE OF SYSTEM SO- I'D I JUST WANTED THAT OUT THERE BECAUSE I WAS GOING TO SAY ANYTHING BECAUSE IT'S STILL ON THE GOVERNOR'S DESK BUT- YOU YOU BROUGHT THAT ALSO FOR PURPOSES OF JUST. LETTING YOU KNOW THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS GOTTEN THEIR ARMS TO SOME DEGREE AROUND THIS. PARTICULAR ISSUE- SENATOR YOUR HONOR. THANK YOU ADJOURNMENTS SO MY QUESTION ACTUALLY WAS TO MISTER SANTA ELF- I WONDERED. HOW SUCCESSFUL YOUR PLACEMENT IN CORPORATE BOARD TO SPEND AND YOU EITHER. FIVE HOW MANY- DIVERSE PEOPLE YOU'VE BEEN ABLE TO GET. CORPORATIONS TO POINT TO THEIR BOARDS ARE HOW MANY COMPANIES ARE. ACTUALLY UTILIZING YOUR SERVICES. THIS IS MICHELLE- I CAN SPEAK TO ABOUT TWO INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE BEEN PLACED- THE BOOK ABOUT PLACEMENTS HAVE BEEN IN THE NONPROFIT SECTOR AND WITH GOVERNMENT COMMISSIONS BUT WITH OUR NEW RELATIONSHIP WITH NASDAQ AND WITH THEM- WELL FIRST OF ALL WITH THE PUSH. THAT HAS BEEN DONE BY THE- BY THE CALIFORNIA ASSEMBLY AND THE GOVERNOR SIGNING THIS BILL- WE'RE SEEING MORE MOMENTUM MORE RELATIONSHIPS AND MORE MOVEMENT AS A RESULT OF THAT SO WHAT WE'VE DONE RECENTLY ASKED ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP THAT I MENTION WITH NASDAQ WHICH ALLOWS US TO. ENGAGE THERE ARE COMPANIES THAT ARE LISTED ON THE EXCHANGE AND WHEN THEY'RE LOOKING FOR BOARD MEMBERS THEY MAY LOOK TO US SO THAT'S ONE WAY THAT WE'RE LOOKING TO MOVE THAT NUMBER OF THE CORPORATIONS THAT NUMBER FOR INDIVIDUALS THAT WOULD PLACE CORPORATIONS. BUT THE THREE HUNDRED THAT YOU CURRENTLY SEE MOST OF THOSE ON THE PRINTER I MENTIONED THAT BUT ARE ACTIVELY ON BOARDS MOST ARE GOVERNMENT COMMISSIONS AND MOST ARE IN THE NONPROFIT SECTOR WITH A SMALL. SECTION OF THAT BEING CORPORATIONS. THANK YOU SENATOR. SEVERAL NAZARIAN. THANK YOU PERSONAL THANK YOU TO THE CULTURES AND THANK YOU TO ALL MY COLLEAGUES FROM BOTH HOUSES OF BEING HERE IT'S WONDERFUL TO SEE YOU ALL TWO WEEKS AFTER SESSION ENDED AND THANK YOU TO THE WONDERFUL PANELS PANELISTS- THIS IS A THIS IS A QUESTION FOR. ALL OF THE PANELISTS WHO ARE AVAILABLE RIGHT NOW AND WHO ARE STILL WITH US I- I VERY MUCH APPRECIATED YOUR PRESENTATION AND IT TAKES SOMETIMES THE ACT OF LEGISLATURE IN ORDER TO PUSH A CERTAIN- CHANGE IN THE CULTURE OF THINKING AND ONCE WEDO THAT IT PRECIPITATES AND OVER TIME WE SEE OTHER STEPS TAKE THAT TAKE EFFECT SO THAT'S THAT'S HOPEFULLY WHAT WE CAN ACHIEVE. WITH THE A MARGINAL MOVEMENT FROM FROM OUR INSTITUTION BUT ASKING THIS BROADLY TO ALL THE PANELISTS I'M INTERESTED TO KNOW ALSO WHAT ARE THE ACHIEVABLE N. OF PROJECTED DESIRES OF WHAT WE WANT. TO HAVE SOMETHING TO WORK TOWARDS WHAT IS IT WHAT NUMBERS DO YOU THINK ABOUT OUR BOTH ATTAINABLE AND ALSO GOOD GOALS WHICH MIGHT NOT BE ATTAINED BUT GOOD GOALS TO SET FOR US TO BE ABLE TO WANT TO ACHIEVE OUT BY A CERTAIN TIME LINE SO IF ANYONE WANTS TO JUMP IN AND- OFFER SOME THOUGHTS- ESPECIALLY FROM THE PRIVATE SECTOR I'D BE VERY INTERESTED TO HEAR.
