IN ADDITION TO VOTE ONLY ONCE WE ADDRESSED EARLIER TWENTY FIVE ONE THREE TWENTY FIVE. THEY JUST GIVE ME ONE MINUTE HERE THAT'S OKAY I RESPECT THAT. TAKE. WE'LL PAUSE FOR A MINUTE. ASSEMBLY. YEAH. MENDOCINO ONE OF THE- SOME OF THE FEEDBACK THAT I'VE GOT FROM MY DISTRICT SUPERINTENDENTS AROUND EIGHTY EIGHT FUNDING- ESPECIALLY AS WE HAD THIS HOLD HARMLESS- WILL LAST IN THE TWENTY. IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE SCHOOL YEAR WE WERE LOOKING AT THIS FOR TWENTY. ONE TWENTY TWO- I THINK THAT MAYBE WE COULD CONSIDER ADDRESSING YOU KNOW EIGHTY EIGHT ALLOWING DISTRICTS IF DISTRICTS TO HAVE HIGHER EDA. IN THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO SCHOOL YEAR. TO- REVISIT THERE ARE A HOLD HARMLESS FUNDING FOR MAKING SENSE HERE- IT'S A CONSIDERATION THAT I THINK WOULD BE REALLY HELPFUL AS SOME DISTRICTS HAVE TAKEN ON MORE STUDENTS AND WILL BE SERVING MORE STUDENTS AND SHOULD BE MADE WHOLE FINANCIALLY. YEAH THAT'S THAT'S A POINT THAT WE- HAVE NOTED YOU KNOW WE WERE TRYING TO FOCUS ON THE ONES WHO WENT THE OTHER DIRECTION OF COURSE BUT SOME COMMUNITIES HAVE GROWTH- I THINK THIS OF THIS BUDGET ENABLES US TO. GET THROUGH WORK ACT WITH THE PANDEMIC. AND CERTAINLY WE ALWAYS HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO REVISIT. THANK YOU SIR. I THINK WE'RE WAITING MR IMAGINE IF COMMENT YES SIR YEAH THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR- CONTINUED COMMITMENT TO FUNDING OF ETHNIC STUDIES. AND LOOK FORWARD TO THE DISCUSSIONS WITH THE ADMINISTRATION TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS IMPORTANT PRORAM. IS FULLY FUNDED THANK YOU THANK YOU. YEAH THIS MISTER MEDINA AND JUST AS YOU KNOW WHILE WE'RE WAITING FOR- IF YOU THE MEMBERS TO RECONCILE SOME OF THE ITEMS TODAY- JUST WASN'T AS THE PRIMARY FOR A LEGISLATION WE WANT TO MAKE ETHNIC STUDIES WORK AND THERE'S A COMPANION BILL. WHICH WE- FULLY EMBRACED THE ASSEMBLY. BUT WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY. TO HELP IMPLEMENTED WITH THIS YEAR'S BUDGET AS WELL SO THIS I THINK IS VERY VERY TIMELY. AND THANK YOU FOR PUSHING THIS FOR ALL THESE YEARS THANK YOU FOR NEVER GIVING UP. YOUR JACK. OKAY SO WITH THAT WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND ON. ISSUE NUMBER HAT ISSUE NUMBER ONE. THE PROP NINETY EIGHT PACKAGE WHICH AGAIN. ARE ITEMS NUMBER. ONE THROUGH. TWENTY TWO. AND- MR GALLAGHER. SO YES I JUST TO COLLECT SOME OF THE IN A LOT IN HERE- AND THEY GET MOST BECAUSE- CHANGES I THINK WE ARE PROPOSING- IT WITH REGARD TO STATE PRESCHOOL AND UNIVERSAL TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN- I DO THINK WE NEED TO OBVIOUSLY WE NEEDED WE NEED TO PUT IN HERE THE RATE REFORM. PORTION I DO THINK WE NEED TO BE THINKING ABOUT. IT'S NICE OF THEM PROPOSING TO VOTE AGAINST THIS BUT WOULD YOU BE THINKING ABOUT. TRANSITIONING I THINK FROM OUR AMAR TO A MORE STANDARDIZED. RATES BECAUSE IN THE LONG TERM WE CAN GET TO AN UNEQUAL POSITION- AGAIN DEPENDING ON YOUR REGION- IF WE'RE BASING IT. JUST ON RMR AND SO I MEAN THAT'S ONE THING I'D FLAG IS THAT WE MAY WANT SOME FLEXIBILITY. INTO THE FUTURE TO GO TO A MORE STANDARD- RATE SYSTEM BUT OBVIOUSLY THIS IS AN IMPROVEMENT ON WHAT WE'VE GOT. RIGHT NOW- SO THAT WAS JUST ONE THING I WANTED TO. MENTION ON THIS- ON RE OPENING PUBLIC SCHOOLS THAT PORTION- IT'S HARD FOR ME TO VOTE ON THAT SECTION AT THIS POINT IN TIME BECAUSE YOU REALLY DON'T HAVE ANY. LANGUAGE CAN HAVE PLACEHOLDER LANGUAGE. SO I WOULD HAVE CRIED AS MAYBE A STAIN ON THAT ITEM NUMBER- I THINK WE'VE HIGHLIGHTED VERY CLEARLY THAT THERE'S SOME PROBLEMS- MAYBE THE MOST THE POSTER CHILD FOR THIS IS SAN FRANCISCO UNIFIED- WHO. YOU'RE REALLY I THINK ABUSE WHAT WE HAD PASSED EARLIER IN THE YEAR. THE OPENING FOR WHAT ONE DAY- OUT OF THE YEAR AND- POSSIBLY- COLLECTING FUNDS WERE MANY OTHER SCHOOLS ACTUALLY DID OPEN- AND. YOU KNOW AND IN SOME WAYS IS KIND OF PUTS THEM AT A DISADVANTAGE- MANY OF THOSE SCHOOLS HAD TRANSPORTATION COSTS. ALL KINDS OF OTHER COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH YOU KNOW MAKING THE EFFORT THE REAL EFFORT TO BE REACHED TO BE OPEN FOR KIDS AND- HAVING SOME GREATER. YOU KNOW- SAFEGUARDS ON WHAT THOSE REQUIREMENTS ARE I THINK WOULD BE IMPORTANT- SO THAT'S. SHOP WITH THE RIGHT ADAM I THINK I WOULD HAVE STAINED OKAY- SO MR GALLAGHER CAN CAN YOU GO BACK AND JUST. SEE WHAT NUMBERS THEY ARE I GUESS THAT WOULD BE NUMBER NINE YEAH THAT WOULD THAT BE RIGHT. K. TO OBTAINING A NUMBER. NINE AND IN THE OTHER THE OTHER ONES LIKE THE RATES YOU WERE JUST PROVIDING SOME COMMENTARY COMMENTS WHICH AGAIN CURRENT AND THAT MAY WE TRIED TO RUBIO RESERVE SOME KIND OF FLEXIBILITY ON THAT IN THE FUTURE- TO GO TO MORE STANDARDIZED RATES. NUMBER FIFTEEN I WOULD BE IN A. AND PRIMARILY BECAUSE AGAIN WE ARE WE ARE EXCLUDING NON CLASSROOM BASED CHARTER SCHOOLS. AND AS WE SAID I THINK THAT FOR EXPANDING LEARNING LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES THEY SHOULD BE AND INCLUDED. AND THERE ARE NO ON EIGHTEEN. OKAY THANK YOU MISTER GALLAGHER WILL NOTE THOSE ITEMS ASSEMBLY MEMBER VADAR STUDENTS- MENTIONED ISSUES THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO. HOW DOES NOT FOR YOUR YOUR ABOUT. I'LL JUST BE AND STATE ABSTAINING OR NOT VOTING ON ITEM NUMBER NINE. AND WE'RE NINE. OKAY SO WE HAVE A MOTION SENATE YEAH WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND ON THE PROP NINETY EIGHT PACKAGE ISSUE- NUMBER ONE. WE HAVE A MOTION FROM I THINK MISTER LEE'S SECOND PREMISE THAT HAVE BETTER SECOND RANTS. AND WE NOTE ITEMS THAT THE OTHER MEMBERS WILL BE HOSTING PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. MCCARTY HI GALLAGHER. PLEASE MEDINA FOR DONALD REYES. VETERANS. OKAY. WE WERE NOT ALMOST DONE. WITH THAT P. THREE TWELVE PIECE HIGHER AT NEXT OKAY ISSUE NUMBER TWO THIS IS OUR EARLY EDUCATION PACKAGE FOR THE ASSEMBLY THIS IS SOMETHING THAT- WE PUT A LOT OF WORK INTO. AND WE DID EARLIER IN THE LAST ITEM PROP NINETY EIGHT. ADOPT THE MONUMENTAL TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN- UNIVERSAL TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN- PROGRAM HERE IN CALIFORNIA WHERE WE WILL HAVE A RAMPING UP TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE THAT AVAILABLE FOR ALL KIDS IN CALIFORNIA IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS. BUT WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT IS THAT OVER AND OVER THAT YOU KNOW THIS IS PART OF AN OVERALL PACKAGE SO NOT JUST TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN WHICH WE FULLY FUND THE PROP NINETY EIGHT- BUT AS WELL AS MAKING SURE WE TO STOP. OUR CHILD CARE PROGRAMS IN THE PROVIDER RATES- BECAUSE IT ONLY WORKS IF YOU HAVE ALL THE PIECES OF PLUGGING ALONG SO I KNOW THERE ARE LOTS OF NUMBERS AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS HERE BUT I KIND OF WANT TO PUT THIS IN PERSPECTIVE AS FAR AS WHAT THIS MEANS FOR CALIFORNIA FAMILIES SO. FIRST FOR A LOT OF OUR ARE SUBSIDIZED PROGRAMS IN CALIFORNIA SOME PEOPLE HAVE OPPORTUNITIES TO RECEIVE THEM- A LOT OF PEOPLE ESPECIALLY IN HIGH COST AREAS EXACT WHEN THE BAY AREA SOME PARTS OF LA. THEY'RE PRICED OUT THERE THERE'S THERE TO- FOR TWO SO CALLED RICH TO GET THE FREE PROGRAMS BUT THEY'RE WAY TOO POOR TO PAY THE SOMETIMES THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH OR MORE SOMETIMES A VERY TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH FOR EARLY EDUCATION SO. TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN HAVING UNIVERSALLY ACCESSIBLE WILL BE A BIG BOON FOR MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES IN CALIFORNIA. AS WELL WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE OTHER PIECE OF THE PUZZLE INCLUDED WHICH IS WHY WE EXPAND UPON THE GOVERNOR'S. SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN CHILD CARE SLOTS THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES WE. KNOW A HUNDRED THOUSAND. NEW CHILD CARE. AND WE PROPOSE AN ADDITIONAL HUNDRED THOUSAND FOR A TOTAL OF TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND. THAT CHILD CARE SLOTS ESSENTIALLY I'M GOING FROM ROUGHLY THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY OR SO. THOUSAND CHILD CARE SLOTS IN CALIFORNIA. TWO FIVE HUNDRED AND SIXTY THOUSAND A SICK THAT SIGNIFICANT INCREASE. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN FOR FAMILIES IN CALIFORNIA THERE ARE ABOUT. FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND FAMILIES ON THE WAITING LIST SO WITH THIS ACTION WE WILL CUT THAT WAITING LIST. AND HALF. AND THAT WOULD REALLY CHANGE LIVES FOR FAMILIES IN CALIFORNIA. BUT I'M ONLY WORKING MOMS WHO ARE TRYING TO. GET AHEAD GO TO WORK GO TO SCHOOL SO THIS ESSENTIALLY. WILL PUT OUR VALUES- RIGHT- IN PEN AND PENCIL RIGHT HERE TO OUR ACTIONS TODAY. AND SECONDLY WE HAVE THIS LONG OVERDUE- RATE REFORM. WHICH IS YOU KNOW IT'S SOUNDS LIKE REFORM GOVERNMENT THING BUT IT'S REALLY. WAY MORE THAN REFORMING RATES AS MR GALLAGHER SAID IT MAKES PROGRAMS- VIABLE THROUGHOUT THE STATE FINANCIALLY VIABLE. HELPS THEM PENCIL OUT MORE. BUT ALSO ALLOWS THEM TO PAVE OUR PROVIDERS ARE ARE WORKFORCE THAT WE TREASURE. LIVING WAGES SO YOU KNOW. SINCE SENT TO ME TIMES ARE PROVIDERS- MOVE ON FROM JOB TO JOB BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT PAID AN ADEQUATE WAGE THEY CAN GO WORK AT A- FAST FOOD- ESTABLISHMENT FOR MORE THAN GET. AS A PRESCHOOL TEACHER SO. THAT'S CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT'S NOT IN TUNE WITH THEIR VALUES SO THIS WILL ALLOW US TO. TO BOOST UP THESE PROGRAMS TO SERVE MORE. KIDS THROUGH THE EXISTING- PRESCHOOL AND CHILD CARE PROGRAMS AS WELL AS RAMP UP. WHAT WE ARE DOING WITH THE NEW CHILD CARE SLOTS IN ADDITION. WITH TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN. WITH YOUR KIDS IN. THE CALIFORNIA STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM. THE BE AN OPPORTUNITY TO USE THOSE OF THIS MONIE TO SERVE KIDS THREE THREE. AND WITH THESE INCREASED RATES WILL BE ABLE TO SERVE. MORE CALIFORNIA KIDS IN THE EXISTING PROGRAMS ON SO THAT I THINK IS A WIN FOR THE KIDS OF CALIFORNIA WILL HAVE. TWO YEARS OR MORE OF QUALITY EARLY EDUCATION BEFORE THEY ENTER KINDERGARTEN REALLY ABLE TO ADDRESS OUR KINDERGARTEN READINESS GAP. BUT ALSO MAKE SURE WE DON'T LEAVE ANYBODY BEHIND. TO MAKE SURE THE EXISTING PROGRAMS ARE THRIVING AND THEY PAY THEIR WORK FORCE A LIVING WAGES. ON THE THIRD ISSUE HERE IS THE FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN PRESCHOOL FACILITIES GRANTS. I WILL BE AMENDING THE GOVERNOR'S MAY VERY REVISED PROPOSAL AND FUNDING FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ONE TIME- TO EXPAND- THOSE FACILITIES AND EXPAND CAPACITY- WE ALSO RESTORE. IS THOUGHT I NEVER FOR THE CHILD CARE FACILITIES- BLOCK GRANT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS- NUMBER FIVE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS. I KNOW THERE'S BEEN A CONCERN WITH WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF UNIVERSAL TKA. WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN WITH OUR EXISTING WORKFORCE. AND AND YOU KNOW WE THINK IT'S THERE'S NOT GOING TO BE IN- ANYTHING TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT THERE WILL BE MORE JOBS AVAILABLE. IN EARLY EDUCATION WITH TEEKAY NOW HAVING TO HIRE MORE- CREDENTIAL TEEKAY TEACHERS AS WELL AS PART PROFESSIONALS IN THE CLASSROOM. WE'RE GOING TO BE NEEDING MORE INDIVIDUALS SEARCH SERVING. THE STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM FOR A THREE'S POTENTIALLY FORCING FAMILIES WHO WANT TO STAY IN STATE PRESCHOOL. AS WELL AS INFANTS AND TODDLERS SO THIS WILL HELP HELP US BUILD THAT. THE NUMBER OF- PROFESSIONALS IN THE STATE. THROUGH- WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AND AGAIN WITH THE REIMBURSEMENT RATES PAY THEM PROPER. WAGES AND- IT NUMBER SO WITH TO HUNDRED- ITEM NUMBER SIX EXCUSE ME PROVIDE TWO HUNDRED FIVE MILLION ONE TIME FEDERAL. FUNDS FOR EXPANDED LICENSING CHILD CARE CAPACITY. THIS IS THE BILL BACK CHILD CARE. AND THEN AND ISSUED ASSEMBLYMEMBERS RAY S. MENTIONED EARLIER WE PROVIDE ONE TIME MONEY TO- CAP FAMILY TOO I'M SORRY TO WAY FAMILY FEES. THREE TWENTY TWENTY THREE WHICH HAS BEEN A PRIORITY OF THE ASSEMBLY AS WELL AS A DOT PLACEHOLDER TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE. TO CAP FAMILY FEES OF I'VE NEVER EIGHT- WE WOULD- THIS IS NOT THE QUESTION. YES THIS IS VERY BAD. OKAY HAVE I HAD AN EIGHT THIS IS THE CHILD CARE PROVIDERS UNITED AGREEMENT- THIS IS A PIECE OF THE AGREEMENT ARE STILL AT WORK TO BE DONE WITH OUR CHILD CARE PROVIDERS IN THE ADMINISTRATION BUT THIS WOULD RATIFY A PIECE OF THAT AGREEMENT HAS BEEN REACHED RELATED TO PANDEMIC RELIEF INCLUDING STIPENDS CLOSURE DAYS HOLD HARMLESS PROVISIONS MENTAL HEALTH RECRUITMENT AND AGAIN FAMILY FEES. I REMEMBER NINE CHILD NUTRITION WE RESTORE ELEVEN MILLION DOLLARS IN GENERAL FUND FOR- FEDERAL MAIL FUNDS AS WELL AS THE CHILD AN ADULT MEAL. PROGRAM WE ALLOCATE TEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE MY CHILD CARE PLAN .ORG. THE SOCIAL SERVICES- IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS WE PROVIDE TEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR ON GOING FEDERAL FUNDS TO SUPPORT OUR RESEARCH RESOURCE AND REFERRAL AGENCIES. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE ADMINISTERING PROBABLY THE CALIFORNIA ALTERNATE PAYMENT PROGRAM. AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST WE ARE ADOPTING TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THAT WOULD EXTEND THE SUNSET ON THE ALAMEDA COUNTY CHILD CARE PILOT PROGRAM TO JULY. TWENTY TWENTY THREE. AND AS NOTED EARLIER. THIS SOUNDS LIKE A LAUNDRY LIST OF ISSUES BUT THIS IS CERTAINLY A PACKAGE THAT- WE HAVE BEEN DREAMING AND SCHEMING ABOUT FOR MANY YEARS SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT AT ALL WE'RE ALL VERY VERY PROUD OF I KNOW THIS IS SOMETHING THAT COMES. DOWN FROM THE SPEAKER AS WELL OUR VALUES ARE ABOUT INVESTING IN OUR FUTURE AND NOTHING MORE IMPORTANT THAN OUR YOUNGEST LEARNERS. AS YOU SAID A FEELING OR VIA THERE IS A FEW MONTHS AGO LITTLEST LEARNERS SO I WITH THAT DO WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND FOR OUR EARLY EDUCATION PACKAGE. MOVED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER LEE SECOND BY SELLING OVER MY INTEREST. ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS ON THESE ITEMS. ASSEMBLY MEMBER GALLAGHER. YEAH AGAIN I WOULD JUST HIGHLIGHT THE MINUTE AGAIN SUPPORTIVE OF THE EXPANSION OF SLOTS- BUT THE RMR YOU KNOW WE'VE IN OURSELVES OR FLEXIBILITY GET TO A STANDARDIZED RATE WHICH I THINK ULTIMATELY WOULD BE- THE BETTER. MORE SOUND POSITION FOR US- IN THE LONG TERM I WHICH COULD BE PHASED IN OVER TIME MIA NEW RATE STRUCTURE COULD BE PHASED IN OVER MULTIPLE YEARS- ON THE- I HAD A NUMBER TO. I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT YOU KNOW BECAUSE OF THE T. K. EXPANSION- WE- YEAH. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE FUNDING LIKE DIRECTED TOWARDS SHE K. EXPANSION INTO SO. WOULD LIKE TO SEE LIKE MORE MONIES DIRECTED TOWARDS T. K. EXPANSION SINCE THAT'S- THAT WE'RE GONNA NEED MORE FACILITIES FOR THAT I MEAN I THINK A LOT OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE SAYING. THAT IF WE EXPAND T. K. WE'RE GONNA NEED TO ALSO. PROVIDE FUNDING FOR EXPANDING FACILITIES. AND I'VE ALSO WOULD NOTE ON SOME OF THESE AT LEAST ON THE- WE COULD USE OUR PROVIDES INSTEAD A GENERAL FUND FOR SOME OF THESE FACILITIES- COSTS. AS THE ITEM EIGHT I REALIZE THAT THIS IS ALREADY BEEN NEGOTIATED. I THINK THERE ARE ISSUES WITH THE HOLD HARMLESS POLICY- IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW ENSURING THAT WE HAVE. WORKFORCE. BUT OBVIOUSLY THAT'S ALREADY BEEN NEGOTIATED WE'RE OBLIGATED. TO PHIL THAT CONTRACT. WHEN THE SO THOSE WOULD BE MY COMMENTS JUST ON THIS PACKAGE AS A WHOLE- BUT OVERALL I BELIEVE IT IS A SUPPORTABLE PACKAGE AND AS HE SAID THAT- MUCH NEEDED IMPROVEMENT. IN INVESTMENT. IN THIS AREA- EARLY CARE AND- CHILD CARE AND EARLY EDUCATION WHICH WE KNOW IS IMPORTANT TO THE FUTURE OF OUR OF OUR CHILDREN SO- PRECIADO DATA MISTER CHAIRMAN AND I'LL AND WITH THAT. OKAY THANK YOU.

THREE- ARE JUST TURNED THREE ACTUALLY SHE HAD HER THIRD BIRTHDAY V. AS IN PARTY. AND THE CHILD THE WHAT HAPPENS IN TRANSPIRES FROM THREE TO FOUR IS JUST AMAZING TO SEE A CHILD GROW AND UNDERSTAND THEIR WORLD AND CONCEPTS. AND FAMILY AND COMMUNITY.

AND LOOKING AT THEIR WORLD AND THEY THINK IT'S A WORLD FULL OF MASS AND NOT BEING ABLE TO COME IN CONTACT WITH PEOPLE AND HAVING TO SIT SIX FEET AWAY. FROM OTHER CHILDREN THEIR VIEW OF OUR WORLD IS SO. DIFFERENT AND IT'S KIND OF SAD- IT'S SAD WHEN I'M OUTSIDE NOW AND MY DAUGHTER DOESN'T WANT TO TAKE OFF HER MASK EVEN THOUGH IT'S JUST MOMMY. AND HER AND THIS IS COMING AT A TIME WHERE THESE FOUNDATIONAL YEARS ARE GOING TO BE REALLY HARD TO GET BACK. SO TO SEE THIS EXPANSION NOW.

THANK YOU AND- BEFORE WE TAKE A VOTE ON THIS I JUST WANT TO SAY YOU KNOW THAT THEIR- ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THIS SPACE IN EARLY EDUCATION WHETHER THEY'RE- A CHILD CARE PROVIDER AT THE CENTER BASED PROGRAM.

GOOD AFTER- CHAIRMAN THE AND OUR STEAM EDGE COMMITTEE LEGISLATORS MY NAME IS MIKE WAGNER I AM A CALDERON AND DEMO BOARD MEMBER OF A LOCAL ANIMAL RESCUE GROUP HERE IN DISTRICT FOURTEEN IN CONTRA COSTA COUNTY. IN NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT THE STATE PASSED THE HAYDEN ACT WHICH WAS SUPPOSED TO DRIVE OR STATE TOWARDS BECOMING A NO KILL STATE. BUT THAT ACT WAS TO FUNDED IN THE GREAT RECESSION OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHT AND FUNDING WAS NEVER RESTORED. IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN OUR SHELTERS EUTHANIZED ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND ANIMALS EQUALLY TROUBLING IS THE FACT THAT TWENTY FIVE PERCENT. OF OUR COUNTY SHELTERS IN THE STATE HAVE NO ON PREMISE THAT CARE. SADLY THERE'S A DISCONNECT WHEN IT COMES TO THE PERCEPTION OF STANDARD OF CARE AT ALL COUNTY ANIMAL SHELTERS. HERE IN MY CONTRA COSTA COUNTY WHICH IS THOUGHT TO BE A WELL OFF. DEMOGRAPHIC AREA WITH THE MEDIAN HOME. PRICE OF ONE MILLION DOLLARS OR COUNTY ANIMAL SHELTER HAS A COST PER CAPITA OF ONLY SIX DOLLARS AND THIRTY EIGHT CENTS. THIS IS IN STARK CONTRAST TO THAT OF OUR NEIGHBORS TO THE NORTH IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY THAT ENJOYED A COST PER CAPITA OF FOURTEEN AND A HALF DOLLARS. I URGE YOU TO APPROVE THE GOVERNMENT GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL FOR FORTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR AN ANIMAL GRANT PROGRAM AS ADMINISTERED BY UC DAVIS IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT WE DON'T LEAVE OUR SHELTERS BEHIND THEY ARE VERY IMPORTANT MEMBER OF OUR COMMUNITY. THANK YOU. LET'S GO TO LINE SEVENTY SEVEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS KAREN LAYING TOP OF THE CALIFORNIA ANIMAL WELFARE ASSOCIATION REPRESENTING MANY OF THE SHELTERS THAT HAVE ALREADY SPOKEN WITH AFTERNOON I JUST FEEL REALLY UNDERSCORE THAT THE HIDDEN MANDATE WHEN IT WAS SUSPENDED- TOOK ALL STATE FUNDING AWAY FROM- CALIFORNIA PUBLIC SHELTERS SO. ALL OF THE SHELTER OPERATIONS YOU SEE ARE YOU'RE SITTING COUNTY SHELTERS ARE FUNDED ENTIRELY THROUGH CITY COUNTY GENERAL FUND AND THROUGH ADOPTION FEES THAT ARE ORDINARILY SET MUCH LOWER THAN THE COST OF CARING FOR THE ANIMAL BECAUSE WE WANT PEOPLE TO COME IN AND ADOPT. SOTHIS PROPOSAL FROM THE GOVERNOR WAS INTENDED AND IS INTENDED TO HELP DEVELOP STRATEGIES TO REDUCE EUTHANASIA AND SHELTERS AND THAT'S THE ONLY REAL MONEY THAT WE'VE SEEN IN THIRTEEN YEARS. SO WHEN YOU'RE SAYING AND I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE COMPARING THAT TO OUR EDUCATION PRIORITIES- BECAUSE THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSING TO PUT IT IF YOU SEEN IT BEFORE YOU AND THE SUB COMMITTEE BUT THERE'S LITERALLY NO OTHER SUB COMMITTEE THAT WHEN. MAKE ANY OTHER DECISIONS ABOUT SHELTER FUNDING THIS IS THE PRECEDENT BEEN THE ONLY THING FOR THIRTEEN YEARS SO IF YOU CAN IMAGINE UNDER SO MUCH HOPE AND NOW THAT I YOU'VE ACTED TODAY TO REJECT IT THERE'S A LOT OF DISAPPOINTMENT AND WE'RE HOPING YOU WILL REVISIT. YOUR DECISION AND THE FINAL NEGOTIATIONS THAT ARE STILL TO TAKE PLACE AT THE END OF THE DAY THE ANIMALS ARE CARING FOR ARE YOUR CONSTITUENTS AS WELL AS- ANIMALS THAT DON'T BELONG TO ANYBODY AND ARE GOING TO GET HOME THIRDS THERE YOUR CONSTITUENT ANIMALS SO PLEASE PLEASE RECONSIDER WHEN YOU GOING TO FINAL.

I URGE THE ASSEMBLY TO REVISIT AND APPROVE THE GOVERNOR'S A REGIONAL FORTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR PROPOSAL FOR THIS PROGRAM. AS MANY OTHERS SPEAKERS OF SAID CALIFORNIA ALREADY HAS THE GOAL THAT NO ADOPTABLE OR TREATABLE ANIMAL SHOULD BE EUTHANIZED BUT THEY ARE. IN SHELTERS CANNOT POSSIBLY MEET THAT GOAL UNLESS THE LEGISLATURE PROVIDES PROFESSIONAL AND FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE THROUGH THE SHELTER PROGRAM. ALSO PLEASE KNOW THAT IS THE CODE RESTRICTIONS ARE RELAXING AND PEOPLE ARE GOING BACK TO WORK WE ARE ALREADY SEEING AN INFLUX OF ANIMALS SURRENDERED TO THE SHELTER. MOHAMMED GANDHI SAID THE GREATNESS OF A NATION CAN BE MADE HERE BY THE WAY ANIMALS ARE TREATED. FOR MANY REASONS I BELIEVE THAT AMERICA HAS LOST A LOT OF THE GREATNESS. THE CALIFORNIA IS STILL ON THE FOREFRONT OF PROGRESSIVE THOUGHT AND PROGRESSIVE CHANGE. I URGE THE ASSEMBLY TO STEP IN AND SUPPORT THE SHELTER PROGRAM.
