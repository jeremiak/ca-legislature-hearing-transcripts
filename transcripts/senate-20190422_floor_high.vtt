NOT EVEN PARTICULARLY ATTRACTIVE.

00:53:37.914 --> 00:53:39.382
FOR CENTURIES THE BLACK PEOPLE

00:53:39.449 --> 00:53:42.152
HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO CONFORM TO

00:53:42.218 --> 00:53:44.220
HARSH AND EXPENSE OF STANDARDS

00:53:44.287 --> 00:53:46.389

00:53:47.924 --> 00:53:49.593
SOME PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT THIS IS

00:53:49.659 --> 00:53:51.061
AN ISSUE OF THE PASS.

00:53:51.127 --> 00:53:53.229
THE WERE BEYOND SUCH OUT RIGHT

00:53:59.269 --> 00:54:01.671
AT ALL.

00:54:01.738 --> 00:54:04.207
FEDERAL AND STATE LAW DO PROTECT

00:54:10.714 --> 00:54:12.649
HOWEVER THERE ARE STILL FAR TOO

00:54:12.716 --> 00:54:14.818
MANY CASES OF BLACK EMPLOYEES

00:54:14.884 --> 00:54:16.987

00:54:36.306 --> 00:54:37.841
DISTRACTION TO OTHERS.

00:54:37.907 --> 00:54:39.743
CAN WE TRULY SAY THAT EQUITY

00:54:39.809 --> 00:54:41.344
EXISTS WHEN OUR CHILDREN ARE

00:54:41.411 --> 00:54:43.146
DENIED THE RIGHT TO LEARNING

MEN AND WOMEN ARE DENIED ACCESS

00:54:50.854 --> 00:54:52.188
TO ECONOMIC ADVANCEMENT?

00:54:52.255 --> 00:54:54.157
BECAUSE OF THEIR NATURAL

IMPACT ON BLACK MEN AND WOMEN.

00:55:34.597 --> 00:55:35.965
THIS MEANS THAT THESE POLICIES

00:55:36.032 --> 00:55:38.334
ARE FAR MORE LIKELY TO EXCLUDE

00:55:38.401 --> 00:55:39.736
BLACK PEOPLE FROM THE WORKPLACE

00:55:39.803 --> 00:55:43.440
