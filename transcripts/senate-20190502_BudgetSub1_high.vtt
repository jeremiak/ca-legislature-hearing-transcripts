00:02:20.373 --> 00:02:21.608
HELLO.

00:02:21.674 --> 00:02:22.342
THERE ARE TWO ISSUES BEFORE YOU

00:02:22.408 --> 00:02:23.776
IN THIS ITEM THE FIRST IS -- THE

00:02:23.843 --> 00:02:24.611
ONGOING BASED INCREASE AND THE

00:02:24.677 --> 00:02:26.679
SECOND IS THE ONE TIME FUNDING

00:02:26.746 --> 00:02:27.747
FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE.

00:02:27.814 --> 00:02:29.382
NOW WITH REGARD TO THE BASE

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:31.284
INCREASE.

00:02:31.351 --> 00:02:32.318
WE DON'T HAVE A SPECIFIC

00:02:32.385 --> 00:02:34.287
RECOMMENDATION ON ADOPTING

00:02:34.354 --> 00:02:35.722
REJECTING OR MODIFYING THE

00:02:35.788 --> 00:02:38.091
PROPOSAL -- BUT WE DO OFFER SOME

00:02:38.157 --> 00:02:41.694
ANALYSIS ON THE LAW SCHOOLS THE

00:02:41.761 --> 00:02:43.730
OVERALL BUDGET CONDITION -- THE

00:02:43.796 --> 00:02:46.799
LAW SCHOOL HAS HAD -- A DEFICIT.

00:02:46.866 --> 00:02:48.601
IN RECENT YEARS.

00:02:48.668 --> 00:02:50.904
AND IT'S IN THE PROCESS OF

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.405
ELIMINATING THE DEFICIT.

00:02:52.472 --> 00:02:53.806
AND YOUR GENDER I TURN YOUR

00:02:53.873 --> 00:02:55.875
ATTENTION TO PAGE FIVE WHICH THE

00:02:55.942 --> 00:02:58.778
DISPLAYS A TABLE OF THE SCHOOLS --

00:02:58.845 --> 00:03:01.581
OPERATING BALANCES AND RESERVES --

00:03:01.648 --> 00:03:03.316
STARTING IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN

00:03:03.383 --> 00:03:04.651
EIGHTEEN AND PROJECTIONS IN

00:03:04.717 --> 00:03:06.252
LATER YEARS.

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:07.487
NO ONE THING I WOULD NOTE WHEN

00:03:07.554 --> 00:03:08.922
YOU'RE LOOKING AT THIS TABLE IS

00:03:08.988 --> 00:03:10.423
THAT A FIFTY AS YOU'LL SEE IN

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:11.791
FIGURE.

00:03:11.858 --> 00:03:12.559
TO THE TABLE INCLUDE SOME

00:03:12.625 --> 00:03:14.661
FUNDING THAT THE LEGISLATURE

00:03:14.727 --> 00:03:17.564
PROVIDED HASTINGS -- FOR A

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:18.865
FINANCIAL AID INITIATIVE.

00:03:18.932 --> 00:03:19.866
I WOULD PROVIDE FOR A HALF

00:03:19.933 --> 00:03:21.301
MILLION IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN AND

00:03:21.367 --> 00:03:22.302
THEN THE SCHOOLS BEGINNING TO

00:03:22.368 --> 00:03:24.704
SPEND THOSE FUNDS ARE BEGINNING

00:03:24.771 --> 00:03:25.471
IN [inaudible]

00:03:25.538 --> 00:03:27.240
NINETEEN TWENTY AND THIS FUNDING

00:03:27.307 --> 00:03:29.275
DOESN'T HAVE AN IMPACT ON HIS

00:03:29.342 --> 00:03:31.277
TEAM'S OVERALL OPERATIONS ITS

00:03:31.344 --> 00:03:33.646
ITS PROGRAMMATIC IN NATURE --

00:03:33.713 --> 00:03:35.415
BUT THE FUNDS -- SKEW THE

00:03:35.481 --> 00:03:36.749
NUMBERS SOMEWHAT SO IN OUR

00:03:36.816 --> 00:03:38.618
ANALYSIS WE REVIEW WE REMOVE

00:03:38.685 --> 00:03:40.720
THOSE -- FUNDS AND WHAT WE FOUND

00:03:40.787 --> 00:03:42.722
IS THAT IN NINETEEN TWENTY

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:43.523
HASTINGS PROJECTS WILL ACTUALLY

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.558
START REDUCING ITS DEFICIT

00:03:45.625 --> 00:03:47.093
RATHER THAN INCREASING AS THE

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.195
TABLE MIGHT SUGGEST.

00:03:49.262 --> 00:03:50.430
AT FIRST GLANCE.%

00:03:50.496 --> 00:03:51.731
THE SCHOOL IS REDUCING ITS

00:03:51.798 --> 00:03:55.101
DEFICIT PRIMARILY BY REDUCING --

00:03:55.168 --> 00:03:56.836
TUITION DISCOUNTING -- IT HAD

00:03:56.903 --> 00:03:58.237
INCREASED TUITION DISCOUNTING A

00:03:58.304 --> 00:03:59.672
FEW YEARS AGO AND THAT'S WHAT

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:02.275
ORIGINALLY I WAS A KEY FACTOR

00:04:02.342 --> 00:04:03.810
THAT LED TO THE BUDGET DEFICIT.

00:04:03.876 --> 00:04:04.777
AND THE SCHOOL HAS A LONG TERM

00:04:04.844 --> 00:04:07.580
PLAN. TO ADDRESS ITS DEFICIT AND

00:04:07.647 --> 00:04:08.514
SO THE QUESTION BEFORE THIS

00:04:08.581 --> 00:04:10.350
COMMITTEE IS IS THE COMMITTEE

00:04:10.416 --> 00:04:12.352
COMFORTABLE THAT PLAN WHAT STEPS

00:04:12.418 --> 00:04:14.554
IS THE SCHOOL IT EXPECTED TAKE

00:04:14.621 --> 00:04:15.622
IN THE FUTURE.

00:04:15.688 --> 00:04:17.690
AND IS IT IS A FAST ENOUGH WOULD

00:04:17.757 --> 00:04:19.525
LIKE TO SEE FURTHER PROGRESS OR

00:04:19.592 --> 00:04:22.228
IS IT DOES THAT SEEM ABOUT RIGHT.

00:04:22.295 --> 00:04:23.463
NOW IN ADDITION TO THAT DURING

00:04:23.529 --> 00:04:24.731
THE DEFICIT NUMBERS THAT THOSE

00:04:24.797 --> 00:04:27.000
NUMBERS ALSO SKEW THE RESERVE

00:04:27.066 --> 00:04:28.301
NUMBERS A BIT.

00:04:28.368 --> 00:04:29.235
I'M WHEN WE REVIEWED WHEN WE

00:04:29.302 --> 00:04:29.936
WROTE.

00:04:30.003 --> 00:04:31.437
YOU KNOW A FACTORED OUT THAT

00:04:31.504 --> 00:04:32.905
THAT INITIATIVE FUNDING OTHER

00:04:32.972 --> 00:04:34.307
RESERVES WENT DOWN AND

00:04:34.374 --> 00:04:35.908
EFFECTIVELY WHAT WE FOUND IS

00:04:35.975 --> 00:04:38.478
THAT THE SCHOOL ANTICIPATED. TO

00:04:38.544 --> 00:04:39.979
SPEND ALL OF ITS OPERATING

00:04:40.046 --> 00:04:42.115
RESERVE AND WOULD START COVERING

00:04:42.181 --> 00:04:43.583
OF THE REMAINING DEFICIT IN

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:45.618
OPERATIONS FROM ITS MAINTENANCE

00:04:45.685 --> 00:04:46.853
RESERVE.

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:48.154
NOW THE SCHOOL IN OUR OFFICE

00:04:48.221 --> 00:04:49.088
HAVE A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT

00:04:49.155 --> 00:04:51.491
PERSPECTIVE ON HOW TO INTERPRET

00:04:51.557 --> 00:04:52.058
THIS.

00:04:52.125 --> 00:04:53.426
THE SCHOOL MY UNDERSTANDING OF

00:04:53.493 --> 00:04:55.628
THE SCHOOLS PERSPECTIVE IS THAT --

00:04:55.695 --> 00:04:57.563
IT FEELS THAT BECAUSE THE

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:59.966
MAINTENANCE RESERVE IS FUNGIBLE

00:05:00.033 --> 00:05:01.467
WITH THE OPERATING RESERVE --

00:05:01.534 --> 00:05:04.203
IT'S A BIT ARBITRARY -- TO

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:06.973
DESIGNATE ONE FUNDING OR THE

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:08.708
OTHER AND AND THE TOTAL RESERVES

00:05:08.775 --> 00:05:10.076
COMBINED AREON RESTRICTED AND

00:05:10.143 --> 00:05:11.210
SO THE SCHOOL HAS COMPLETE.

00:05:11.277 --> 00:05:13.813
ABILITY TO USE THOSE FUNDS TO

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:15.615
COVER ITS DEFICIT.

00:05:15.682 --> 00:05:17.817
WHERE WE HAVE A BIT MORE CONCERN

00:05:17.884 --> 00:05:20.053
WITH THIS APPROACH -- WHAT WHAT

00:05:20.119 --> 00:05:21.220
WE FOUND IN THE PAST IS THE ONE

00:05:21.287 --> 00:05:22.722
OF THE WAYS IN WHICH MAINTENANCE

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:24.023
BACKLOGS GROW?

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:25.591
AT STATE AGENCIES IS WHEN THEY

00:05:25.658 --> 00:05:26.959
START USING FUNDS THAT WERE

00:05:27.026 --> 00:05:28.094
DESIGNATED FOR MAINTENANCE

00:05:28.161 --> 00:05:29.796
TOWARDS OTHER BUDGETARY

00:05:29.862 --> 00:05:30.997
PRIORITIES.

00:05:31.064 --> 00:05:32.165
AND SO THE FACT THAT THE SCHOOL

00:05:32.231 --> 00:05:34.100
WILL HAVE TO START A SPENDING

00:05:34.167 --> 00:05:35.501
DOWN ITS MAINTENANCE RESERVE.

00:05:35.568 --> 00:05:36.502
A WE THINK.

00:05:36.569 --> 00:05:38.037
RAISES FURTHER QUESTIONS ABOUT

00:05:38.104 --> 00:05:39.439
WHETHER OR NOT IT'S IT'S IT'S

00:05:39.505 --> 00:05:40.873
TAKE DOING ENOUGH TO ADDRESS

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:43.409
THIS DEFICIT.

00:05:43.476 --> 00:05:45.478
NO REVIEWING THIS PROPOSAL OTHER

00:05:45.545 --> 00:05:46.312
COMMITTEE MIGHT ALSO WONDER WELL

00:05:46.379 --> 00:05:48.081
WHAT IS THE CONDITION OF A

00:05:48.147 --> 00:05:51.217
HAZING FACILITIES TO DATE ARE

00:05:51.284 --> 00:05:51.818
THEY IN GOOD SHAPE ARE THEY IN

00:05:51.884 --> 00:05:52.819
BAD SHAPE.

00:05:52.885 --> 00:05:53.953
AND OUR VIEW SUGGESTS THAT THE

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:55.254
SCHOOLS ACTUALLY AND AND

00:05:55.321 --> 00:05:56.355
RELATIVELY BETTER SHAPE THAN

00:05:56.422 --> 00:05:58.191
OTHER STATE AGENCIES YOU MIGHT

00:05:58.257 --> 00:05:58.791
HAVE EXPERIENCED IN IN YOUR

00:05:58.858 --> 00:05:59.859
HEARINGS.

00:05:59.926 --> 00:06:01.394
AND THAT'S LARGELY BECAUSE THE

00:06:01.461 --> 00:06:03.229
STATE HAS ADDRESS THIS BACKLOG

00:06:03.296 --> 00:06:04.163
AYE THROUGH NUMBER OF DIFFERENT

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:06.599
ACTIONS SO THE SCHOOL HAS TO

00:06:06.666 --> 00:06:07.400
FACILITIES.

00:06:07.467 --> 00:06:09.035
OF THOSE WHO WANT ONE IS WHAT IS

00:06:09.102 --> 00:06:10.903
SLATED TO BE REPLACED FROM AN

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:11.971
WITH A NEW BUILDING THAT WILL

00:06:12.038 --> 00:06:13.873
COME ONLINE SOON THAT WAS FUNDED

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:15.041
BY THE STATE A FEW YEARS AGO.

00:06:15.108 --> 00:06:16.676
THE SECOND BUILDING HAS RECEIVED

00:06:16.743 --> 00:06:18.010
SOME FUNDING FOR PROJECTS AND

00:06:18.077 --> 00:06:19.946
IT'S LARGELY ADDRESS A LOT OF

00:06:20.012 --> 00:06:21.247
ITS BACKLOG.

00:06:21.314 --> 00:06:23.216
IF YOU TURN TO PAGE -- SIX AND

00:06:23.282 --> 00:06:25.017
YOU'LL SEE A TABLE THERE THAT

00:06:25.084 --> 00:06:26.819
SHOWS HE THINGS.

00:06:26.886 --> 00:06:28.287
ESTIMATE OF BACKLOG TODAY.

00:06:28.354 --> 00:06:29.622
AND AS YOU CAN SEE THE SCHOOL

00:06:29.689 --> 00:06:31.891
HAS STARTED TO INCLUDE IN ITS

00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:32.825
MAINTENANCE WAS PROJECTS THAT.

00:06:32.892 --> 00:06:34.927
THE STATE SOMETIMES CONSIDERS TO

00:06:34.994 --> 00:06:36.295
BE LOWER PRIORITY SO THINGS LIKE

00:06:36.362 --> 00:06:37.630
CARPET REPLACEMENT'S ENTER YOUR

00:06:37.697 --> 00:06:38.464
PAINTING.

00:06:38.531 --> 00:06:40.833
THESE ARE PROJECTS THAT ARE ARE.

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:42.101
SCHEDULED TO HAPPEN BUT THEY'RE

00:06:42.168 --> 00:06:44.036
THEY'RE NOT NECESSARILY CRITICAL --

00:06:44.103 --> 00:06:45.772
BUILDING OPERATIONS PROJECTS

00:06:45.838 --> 00:06:47.406
THAT YOU MIGHT SEE ANOTHER

00:06:47.473 --> 00:06:49.008
AGENCIES THAT ARE IN MUCH FIFTH

00:06:49.075 --> 00:06:52.411
HAVE FACILITIES WITH MUCH WORSE

00:06:52.478 --> 00:06:53.179
CONDITION.

00:06:53.246 --> 00:06:54.113
SO THAT THE ISSUE FOR DEFERRED

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:55.148
MAINTENANCE IN THE CASE OF

00:06:55.214 --> 00:06:57.917
HASTINGS IS -- TO SOME EXTENT

00:06:57.984 --> 00:06:58.818
PAYING DOWN THE BACKLOG BUT

00:06:58.885 --> 00:07:00.319
ULTIMATELY THE THE QUESTION

00:07:00.386 --> 00:07:01.854
BEFORE THE COMMITTEE IS HOW WILL

00:07:01.921 --> 00:07:03.623
THE SCHOOL -- ADDRESS

00:07:03.689 --> 00:07:04.524
MAINTENANCE IN THE FUTURE SO

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:06.259
THAT FIFTEEN YEARS FROM NOW IT

00:07:06.325 --> 00:07:07.693
WILL BE ABLE TO START.

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:09.629
OF FUNDING MAINTENANCE PROJECTS

00:07:09.695 --> 00:07:13.232
WITH ITS NEW BUILDING.

00:07:13.299 --> 00:07:15.668
I'M SO GIVEN THE OUR ANALYSIS OF

00:07:15.735 --> 00:07:17.570
THE CURRENT BACKLOG IN THE FACT

00:07:17.637 --> 00:07:18.738
THAT THE SCHOOL HAS MAINTENANCE

00:07:18.805 --> 00:07:20.740
RESERVES WE RECOMMEND THE

00:07:20.807 --> 00:07:22.775
LEGISLATURE REJECT THE PROPOSED

00:07:22.842 --> 00:07:23.743
A ONE TIME FUNDING FOR

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:24.911
MAINTENANCE AND DIRECT THE

00:07:24.977 --> 00:07:25.812
SCHOOL INSTEAD TO FUND THESE

00:07:25.878 --> 00:07:26.412
REMAINING.

00:07:26.479 --> 00:07:28.281
OF PROJECTS FROM ITS MAINTENANCE

00:07:28.347 --> 00:07:29.382
RESERVE.

00:07:29.448 --> 00:07:30.483
AND THEN MOVING FORWARD WE ALSO

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:32.418
RECOMMEND AS WE DO IN THE CASE

00:07:32.485 --> 00:07:34.353
OF UC AND CSU. TO DEVELOP A LONG

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:35.988
TERM PLAN TO ADDRESS ITS

00:07:36.055 --> 00:07:37.790
MAINTENANCE BACKLOG -- OBVIOUSLY

00:07:37.857 --> 00:07:38.925
THAT AGAIN THE CONSIDERATION

00:07:38.991 --> 00:07:40.626
HEARD BE SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT --

00:07:40.693 --> 00:07:42.128
THERE THERE'S SOME BACKLOG WE

00:07:42.195 --> 00:07:42.929
NEED TO BE PAID DOWN BUT

00:07:42.995 --> 00:07:45.331
ULTIMATELY THAT PLAN WOULD WOULD --

00:07:45.398 --> 00:07:47.166
DEVELOP OF A WAY FOR THE SCHOOL

00:07:47.233 --> 00:07:48.134
TO SET ASIDE FUNDING EACH YEAR

00:07:48.201 --> 00:07:49.602
SO THAT WHEN MEANS PROJECTS

00:07:49.669 --> 00:07:50.970
PROJECTS ARE SCHEDULED HAS

00:07:51.037 --> 00:07:53.139
FUNDING TO TO UNDERTAKE THOSE

00:07:53.206 --> 00:07:54.073
PROJECTS.

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:55.575
THANK YOU ONE HAS TO QUESTION

MY OLD BRAIN BUT OUR ANALYSIS

00:08:04.383 --> 00:08:06.752
REFLECTS THE TASTINGS WILL BEGIN

00:08:06.819 --> 00:08:08.754

JUST RECEIVED SO WAS THERE AND A

00:08:19.098 --> 00:08:21.467
NEW ANALYSIS OR THE ANNOUNCED

THAT I FOR OUR ANALYSIS WE

00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:26.038
EXCLUDED THAT DIVERSITY PIPELINE

00:08:28.341 --> 00:08:29.308
FOR ACTUALLY SO THE TOTAL

00:08:29.375 --> 00:08:32.545
MAINTENANCE BACKLOG HASTINGS IS

SORT OF TIED INTO WHAT THE LA --

00:12:56.842 --> 00:12:57.843

00:12:57.910 --> 00:12:59.145
I'D JUMP ON SEISMIC IN THE

00:12:59.211 --> 00:13:00.146

THE OVERALL -- GENERAL INCREASE

00:13:12.224 --> 00:13:14.026
WILL ALLOW US TO GO INTO AN

00:13:14.093 --> 00:13:16.162
EIGHTH YEAR WITHOUT TUITION --

00:13:16.228 --> 00:13:18.797
RAISE ANY TUITION OF RAISING FOR

00:13:18.864 --> 00:13:21.300
THE STUDENTS -- AND OF COURSE

00:13:21.367 --> 00:13:22.768

IN GOOD WORKING ORDER -- HOW DID

00:13:27.806 --> 00:13:31.777
pTHE STATE -- THE LEGISLATURE IN

THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE FOR THEIR

00:13:33.345 --> 00:13:35.181
SUPPORT OVER THE YEARS -- THEY

00:13:35.247 --> 00:13:37.049
DIDN'T ALLOCATE FUNDS THAT ALLOW

00:13:37.116 --> 00:13:39.084
US TO BUILD A BRAND NEW ACADEMIC

00:13:39.151 --> 00:13:40.653
BUILDING WHICH IS BEING BUILT ON

00:13:40.719 --> 00:13:44.023
CURRENTLY ON AN EMPTY LOT -- AND

00:13:44.089 --> 00:13:45.791
THEN LAST YEAR -- THROUGH AFTER

00:13:45.858 --> 00:13:47.293
THE INITIATIVE OF SOME OF THE

00:13:47.359 --> 00:13:49.895
PORTANTINO -- WE WERE PROVIDED

00:13:49.962 --> 00:13:52.364
WITH A PUT DIVERSITY PIPE BY

00:13:52.431 --> 00:13:54.400
GRANT TO CREATE -- CALIFORNIA

00:13:54.466 --> 00:13:56.335
SCHOLARSHIP FOR GRADUATES OF THE

00:13:56.402 --> 00:13:58.304
H. B. C. USE THIS WILL BE THE

FIRST YEAR THAT THAT -- GRANT

HAVE EVERY EXPECTATION THAT IT

00:14:04.343 --> 00:14:06.278
WILL BE AN EXTRAORDINARY SUCCESS

00:14:06.345 --> 00:14:07.313
HAS BEEN VERY WELL RECEIVED BY

00:14:07.379 --> 00:14:12.918
THE H. B. C. USE -- NATIONALLY.

00:14:12.985 --> 00:14:14.053
CAN YOU SPEAK TO THE THE

00:14:14.119 --> 00:14:15.120
DISCOUNTING PRACTICES THAT SET

00:14:15.187 --> 00:14:17.823
OUT IN THE IN THE OUTLINE IS IS

00:14:17.890 --> 00:14:19.024
I GUESS SECOND YES.

00:14:19.091 --> 00:14:20.326
PRELIMINARY STREAM OF CONSCIOUS

00:14:20.392 --> 00:14:22.027
QUESTIONS I MEAN IS THIS COMMON

00:14:22.094 --> 00:14:22.995
IN.

00:14:23.062 --> 00:14:24.697
LAW SCHOOL BUSINESS THESE DAYS

00:14:24.763 --> 00:14:26.098
AND I NOTICED IT'S NOT NEED

00:14:26.165 --> 00:14:28.234
BASED ITS ITS MERIT BASED SO

00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:29.702
IT'S ESSENTIALLY IN THE FORM OF

00:14:29.768 --> 00:14:31.570
A SCHOLARSHIP BUT WE CALL IT A

00:14:31.637 --> 00:14:33.272
DISCOUNT I GUESS.

00:14:33.339 --> 00:14:36.442
SO YEAH -- FOR FOLLOWING TWO

00:14:36.508 --> 00:14:38.811
THOUSAND EIGHT A REALLY AROUND --

00:14:38.877 --> 00:14:40.579
TWENTY TEN THE APPLICATION POOL

00:14:40.646 --> 00:14:43.415
DECREASED BY AS MUCH AS 40%

00:14:43.482 --> 00:14:44.550
NATIONALLY.

00:14:44.617 --> 00:14:46.752
AND SO THAT RAISE THE

00:14:46.819 --> 00:14:49.088
COMPETITIVENESS -- FOR QUALIFIED

00:14:49.154 --> 00:14:51.490
APPLICANTS TO LAW SCHOOL AND LAW

00:14:51.557 --> 00:14:52.925
SCHOOLS ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND

00:14:52.992 --> 00:14:54.293
IN PARTICULAR IN CALIFORNIA

00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:56.495
INCLUDING ALL OF OUR SCHOOLS THE

00:14:56.562 --> 00:14:58.264
NEW UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA SYSTEM

00:14:58.330 --> 00:15:00.833
BUT ALSO -- PEPPER NINE CHAT MEN

00:15:00.899 --> 00:15:03.869
WILL LOS ANGELES SOUTHWESTERN --

00:15:03.936 --> 00:15:06.805
THE VERY SCHOOLS BEGAN -- TO

00:15:06.872 --> 00:15:08.540
THEY CALL THE SCHOLARSHIP MONEY

00:15:08.607 --> 00:15:10.142
WAS ACTUALLY TUITION DISCOUNTING

00:15:10.209 --> 00:15:12.044
WE WENT -- IN ORDER TO REMAIN

00:15:12.111 --> 00:15:13.779
COMPETITIVE IN THE MARKETPLACE

00:15:13.846 --> 00:15:16.915
FROM AROUND THE 25230% DISCOUNT

00:15:16.982 --> 00:15:18.550
I WHICH WAS THE ORDINARY I THINK

00:15:18.617 --> 00:15:20.252
MOST SCHOOLS FALL THAT -- TO

00:15:20.319 --> 00:15:23.155
AROUND 42405% DISCOUNTING OVER

00:15:23.222 --> 00:15:26.792
THE YEARS FROM AROUND -- TWENTY

00:15:26.859 --> 00:15:27.426
THIRTEEN FOURTEEN OTHER SCHOOLS

00:15:27.493 --> 00:15:30.229
INCLUDING -- OUR SISTER SCHOOLS

00:15:30.296 --> 00:15:31.864
LIKE DAVIS AND IRVINE I HAD

00:15:31.930 --> 00:15:35.334
DISCOUNT RATES ABOUT 505560%

00:15:35.401 --> 00:15:37.770
AWAY -- ESSENTIALIST SO -- IS IN

00:15:37.836 --> 00:15:40.873
THE 65270% TUITION DISCOUNTING A

00:15:40.939 --> 00:15:42.908
RANGE -- AND THEY ARE LARGELY

00:15:42.975 --> 00:15:44.410
BEING SUPPORTED BY THEIR

00:15:44.476 --> 00:15:46.145
CAMPUSES SO ONE OF OUR

00:15:46.211 --> 00:15:48.547
DISADVANTAGES AS A STANDALONE --

00:15:48.614 --> 00:15:49.615
HAS BEEN THAT WE DON'T HAVE A

00:15:49.682 --> 00:15:52.051
CENTRAL CAMPUS TO HELP SUBSIDIZE --

00:15:52.117 --> 00:15:54.586
THAT -- TUITION DISCOUNTING OF

00:15:54.653 --> 00:15:56.722
COURSESTUDENTS BENEFIT -- FROM

00:15:56.789 --> 00:15:58.190
SOME TUITION DISCOUNTING BECAUSE

00:15:58.257 --> 00:16:00.059
TUITION IS QUITE EXPENSIVE THESE

00:16:00.125 --> 00:16:01.627
DAYS BUT IT'S NOT REALLY A

00:16:01.694 --> 00:16:03.562
SUSTAINABLE MODEL AND WE HAVE

00:16:03.629 --> 00:16:05.464
SEEN APPLICATIONS STARTING TO

00:16:05.531 --> 00:16:09.935
RISE -- NOT TO THE LEVELS PRIOR --

00:16:10.002 --> 00:16:10.502
TO TWENTY TWELVE BUT I THINK

00:16:10.569 --> 00:16:12.471
THAT THAT STARTING TO EVEN OUT

00:16:12.538 --> 00:16:13.605
AND I THINK SCHOOLS GENERALLY

00:16:13.672 --> 00:16:14.740
FOLLOWING.

00:16:14.807 --> 00:16:16.542
THE TREND THAT WE ARE WHICH IS

00:16:16.608 --> 00:16:22.481
TO RATCHET BACK -- A PART IT IS

00:16:22.548 --> 00:16:23.515
OF COURSE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

00:16:23.582 --> 00:16:24.149
HAVE A BALANCED BUDGET SO WE'RE

00:16:24.216 --> 00:16:25.250
NOW IN WITH THIS YEAR WE RATCHET

00:16:25.317 --> 00:16:27.019
BACK TO OUR HISTORICAL NORM --

00:16:27.086 --> 00:16:28.921
BUT WE HAVE A TAIL BECAUSE THE

00:16:28.987 --> 00:16:30.456
SECOND YEAR STUDENTS THE THIRD

00:16:30.522 --> 00:16:32.725
YEAR STUDENTS GOT THE DISCOUNT

00:16:32.791 --> 00:16:35.327
OF THAT 42405% SO UNTIL THEY'VE

00:16:35.394 --> 00:16:38.630
GRADUATED -- IT'S A COUPLE OF

00:16:38.697 --> 00:16:39.998
YEARS TO GET BACK TO OUR

00:16:40.065 --> 00:16:41.400
HISTORICAL MEMBERS.

00:16:41.467 --> 00:16:42.835
WELL I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THEN

00:16:42.901 --> 00:16:44.503
WHEN MY FRIENDS IN ACADEMIA PUSH

00:16:44.570 --> 00:16:46.772
BACK ON SO MY COLLEAGUES WHO

00:16:46.839 --> 00:16:48.307
WANT TO START ANOTHER LAW SCHOOL.

00:16:48.374 --> 00:16:50.642
IS NOT A GOOD MARKET -- TO SO

00:16:50.709 --> 00:16:54.747
THE THING YES IT'S POLITICALLY --

00:16:54.813 --> 00:16:56.749
THIN ICE FROM YOU TO TAKE A

00:16:56.815 --> 00:16:58.150
STAND ON THAT.

00:16:58.217 --> 00:17:00.219
I DO AGREE WITH YOU THAT --

00:17:00.285 --> 00:17:02.054
RIGHT NOW THE LAW SCHOOLS IN THE

00:17:02.121 --> 00:17:04.056
STATE OF CALIFORNIA SEEM TO BE A

00:17:04.123 --> 00:17:05.824
SEVEN THE MARKET WELL IF --

00:17:05.891 --> 00:17:07.760
THERE WAS AN ISSUE FOR ME -- IT

00:17:07.826 --> 00:17:09.228
WOULD BE MAKING SURE THAT OUR

00:17:09.294 --> 00:17:11.063
STUDENTS TO GO INTO PUBLIC

00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:12.698
SERVICE AND PUBLIC INTEREST.

00:17:12.765 --> 00:17:15.100
HAVE THE SUPPORT TO LAW SCHOOL

00:17:15.167 --> 00:17:16.935
AND THROUGH -- SOME SORT OF

00:17:17.002 --> 00:17:18.370
FORGIVENESS PROGRAMS WE DO HAVE

00:17:18.437 --> 00:17:20.906
AND ARE ACTIVE IN PI CAP AND OF

00:17:20.973 --> 00:17:22.074
COURSE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

00:17:22.141 --> 00:17:24.877
CURRENTLY -- FORGET IS -- ANY

00:17:24.943 --> 00:17:27.012
LOANS ARE NOT PAID BACK AFTER

00:17:27.079 --> 00:17:29.148
TEN YEARS AND MAY BE UP FOR THE

00:17:29.214 --> 00:17:30.749
TIME BEING EXACTLYTHEY SAY

00:17:30.816 --> 00:17:32.251
THEY'RE GOING TO RIGHT HAVEN'T

00:17:32.317 --> 00:17:33.519
SEEN VERY MANY RIGHT YEAH YEAH

00:17:33.585 --> 00:17:35.154
EXACTLY SO JUST ONE FINAL

00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:36.355
QUESTION FOR ME -- BECAUSE I'M

00:17:36.422 --> 00:17:38.023
CURIOUS HOW DO YOU WHO GETS THE

00:17:38.090 --> 00:17:39.892
DISCOUNTS HOW DO YOU DO YOU HAVE

00:17:39.958 --> 00:17:41.827
A CUT LINE I MEAN IS IT BASED ON

00:17:41.894 --> 00:17:45.330
YOUR LSAT SCORES AND YOUR GPA

00:17:45.397 --> 00:17:47.132
IT'S A MIXTURE -- SO WE DO HAVE

00:17:47.199 --> 00:17:49.968
NEEDS BASED -- AND ABOUT 85290%

00:17:50.035 --> 00:17:51.937
OF OUR STUDENTS ARE NEEDS BASED --

00:17:52.004 --> 00:17:54.840
BASED ON FASTER AND AND OTHER --

00:17:54.907 --> 00:17:57.776
STANDARD -- METRICS -- SO EVEN

00:17:57.843 --> 00:17:59.077
WHEN THEY GET MERIT BASED

00:17:59.144 --> 00:18:01.480
SCHOLARSHIPS THE VERY OFTEN --

00:18:01.547 --> 00:18:03.582
NEEDY STUDENTS IN ANY CASE --

00:18:03.649 --> 00:18:05.350
BUT WE DO OF USE IT

00:18:05.417 --> 00:18:07.186
STRATEGICALLY -- TO TRY TO

00:18:07.252 --> 00:18:08.220
ATTRACT STUDENTS WITH HIGHER

00:18:08.287 --> 00:18:10.722
LCTS AND HIGHER GPA IS PART OF

00:18:10.789 --> 00:18:13.358
THE ARMS RACE QUITE FRANKLY IS

00:18:13.425 --> 00:18:15.027
HOW WE ARE RANKED BY.

00:18:15.093 --> 00:18:16.962
U. S. NEWS THIS AND SO STUDENTS

00:18:17.029 --> 00:18:18.430
ARE MAKING JUDGMENTS SUPPORTERS

00:18:18.497 --> 00:18:20.232
ARE MAKING JUDGMENTS -- BASED ON

00:18:20.299 --> 00:18:22.634
THE PROCEEDS ARE STATUS OF THE

00:18:22.701 --> 00:18:25.204
SCHOOL AND BECAUSE US NEWS TAKES

00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:28.040
INTO ACCOUNT -- CITY IN GPA --

00:18:28.106 --> 00:18:30.843
IT HAS A DIRECT EFFECT ON THE

00:18:30.909 --> 00:18:33.612
SORT OF SPIRALING IN THE FUTURE --

00:18:33.679 --> 00:18:35.414
WHAT LEVEL STUDENT YOU CAN

00:18:35.481 --> 00:18:43.355

SAY JUST TO ADD TO THAT

00:18:47.526 --> 00:18:47.926
THE GERMAN ROUTE THEN.

00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:49.828
WE ALSO USE IT TO ATTRACT

00:18:49.895 --> 00:18:50.462
PROGRAM CALLED OTHER LEGAL AND

00:18:50.529 --> 00:18:51.129

THE CALIFORNIA STATE LIBRARY

00:21:29.321 --> 00:21:30.889
SERVES A CRITICAL ROLE IN STATE

00:21:30.956 --> 00:21:32.057
GOVERNMENT BY SERVING AS THE

00:21:32.124 --> 00:21:34.059
CENTRAL REFERENCE AND RESEARCH

ADDITIONALLY THE STATE LIBRARY

00:21:38.263 --> 00:21:39.965
PROVIDES CRITICAL ASSISTANCE AND

PROGRAM OF ONE MILLION DOLLARS --

00:21:56.148 --> 00:21:57.683
GENERAL FUND.

00:21:57.749 --> 00:22:01.286
THE PROGRAM ENABLES A WITHOUT

00:22:01.353 --> 00:22:03.021
FURTHER ACCESS TO BOOKS AND

00:22:03.088 --> 00:22:05.791

CERTAINLY ENABLE SAP PATRONS --

00:22:11.596 --> 00:22:12.698
TO HAVE ADDITIONAL ACCESS TO

00:22:12.764 --> 00:22:13.965
BOOKS THAT THEY WOULD NOT BE

00:22:14.032 --> 00:22:16.401
ABLE TO OBTAIN AT THEIR LOCAL

00:22:16.468 --> 00:22:17.402
LIBRARY [inaudible]

00:22:17.469 --> 00:22:21.039
HELLO. TO GIVE A LITTLE MORE

00:22:21.106 --> 00:22:22.741
CONTEXT ON A WHAT THE FUNDS

00:22:22.808 --> 00:22:24.910
WOULD BE SPENT ON OF THE WAY THE

00:22:24.976 --> 00:22:27.245
PROGRAM WORKS IS A PATRON AT A

00:22:27.312 --> 00:22:29.014
LIBRARY REQUESTS A BOOK.

00:22:29.081 --> 00:22:30.649
THE LIBRARY THEN.

00:22:30.716 --> 00:22:31.817
AS AN ESTABLISHED LINE OF CREDIT

00:22:31.883 --> 00:22:33.185
THE RAMS ON AND PURCHASED THE

00:22:33.251 --> 00:22:34.820
PURCHASES THE BOOK ON BEHALF OF

00:22:34.886 --> 00:22:36.955
THE PATRON AND THE STATE.

00:22:37.022 --> 00:22:38.724
ULTIMATELY PAYS FOR THE BOOK.

00:22:38.790 --> 00:22:39.424
THE BOOK IS DELIVERED TO THE

00:22:39.491 --> 00:22:41.293
PATRON THE PATRON USES THE BOOK

00:22:41.359 --> 00:22:42.627
RETURNS IT TO THE LIBRARY AND AT

00:22:42.694 --> 00:22:43.929
THAT POINT THE LIBRARY EITHER

00:22:43.995 --> 00:22:45.464
DECIDES TO MAINTAIN THE BOOK

00:22:45.530 --> 00:22:48.433
KEEP IT OR ARE TO SELL THROUGH

00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:49.868
ITS FOUNDATION.

00:22:49.935 --> 00:22:50.669
THE PROGRAM IS CURRENTLY

00:22:50.736 --> 00:22:52.671
OVERSEEN BY NORTH NET WHICH IS A

00:22:52.738 --> 00:22:53.905
LIBRARY COOPERATIVE SYSTEM IN

00:22:53.972 --> 00:22:55.107
NORTHERN CALIFORNIA.

00:22:55.173 --> 00:22:57.342
AND ACCORDING THE STATE LIBRARY

00:22:57.409 --> 00:22:58.009
NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS OF

00:22:58.076 --> 00:22:59.511
THE ONE MILLION WOULD BE SPENT

00:22:59.578 --> 00:23:01.613
ON BOOK PURCHASES ABOUT SIXTY

00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:02.848
THOUSAND BUCKS ESTIMATES.

00:23:02.914 --> 00:23:04.182
THE REMAINING HUNDRED THOUSAND

00:23:04.249 --> 00:23:05.584
WOULD BE SPENT ON NORTH NOTES

00:23:05.650 --> 00:23:10.021
ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS.

00:23:10.088 --> 00:23:11.590
WE REVIEW THIS PROPOSAL -- WE

00:23:11.656 --> 00:23:12.858
FOUND THAT THAT ONE OF THE OVER

00:23:12.924 --> 00:23:15.026
ARCHING GOALS OF THIS PROGRAM IS

00:23:15.093 --> 00:23:16.895
TO ENSURE THAT -- RURAL

00:23:16.962 --> 00:23:18.964
LIBRARIES WITH RELATIVELY FEW

00:23:19.030 --> 00:23:19.765
RESOURCES.

00:23:19.831 --> 00:23:22.300
I CAN MEET PATRON REQUESTS FOR

00:23:22.367 --> 00:23:23.502
LIBRARY RESOURCES.

00:23:23.568 --> 00:23:25.170
AND THAT OVERARCHING GOAL IS

00:23:25.237 --> 00:23:27.172
SOMETHING THAT IS BEEN A LONG

00:23:27.239 --> 00:23:29.007
ESTABLISHED GOLDEN STATE LAW.

00:23:29.074 --> 00:23:30.142
WE'RE CONCERNED HOWEVER THAT THE

00:23:30.208 --> 00:23:31.610
PROPOSAL LACKED A COUPLE OF KEY

00:23:31.676 --> 00:23:33.178
CONSIDERATIONS WHEN IT WAS

00:23:33.245 --> 00:23:34.279
SUBMITTED TO THE LEGISLATURE.

00:23:34.346 --> 00:23:35.447
A WALK THROUGH SOME OF THOSE --

00:23:35.514 --> 00:23:37.849
ISSUES.

00:23:37.916 --> 00:23:40.685
OF THE FIRST IS THAT THE THE

00:23:40.752 --> 00:23:42.287
PROPOSAL ITSELF DIDN'T FULLY

00:23:42.354 --> 00:23:44.222
ARTICULATE -- THE THE MAGNITUDE

00:23:44.289 --> 00:23:46.391
OF THE PROBLEM SO THERE WAS NO

00:23:46.458 --> 00:23:48.226
DATA FOR EXAMPLE ON A WHICH

00:23:48.293 --> 00:23:49.461
LIBRARIESHAVE DIFFICULTY

00:23:49.528 --> 00:23:50.762
MEETING PATRON REQUEST WHICH

00:23:50.829 --> 00:23:52.097
LIBRARIES ARE RELATIVELY UNDER

00:23:52.164 --> 00:23:53.198
RESOURCE.

00:23:53.265 --> 00:23:54.466
AND THOSE DIFFICULT TO KNOW IF

00:23:54.533 --> 00:23:55.600
HE CURRENT PROGRAM IS WAS

00:23:55.667 --> 00:23:57.102
TARGETED ADEQUATELY.

00:23:57.169 --> 00:23:58.804
A WE DID FIND THAT FROM SOME

00:23:58.870 --> 00:24:00.939
HISTORICAL INFORMATION.

00:24:01.006 --> 00:24:02.407
BUDGET DATA FOUND THAT -- THE

00:24:02.474 --> 00:24:03.175
LIBRARIES ARE CURRENTLY

00:24:03.241 --> 00:24:04.743
PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM THEY

00:24:04.810 --> 00:24:05.944
SPENT ABOUT TEN MILLION DOLLARS

00:24:06.011 --> 00:24:07.712
OF THEIR LOCAL RESOURCES TO

00:24:07.779 --> 00:24:09.514
REQUIRE PRINT MATERIALS.

00:24:09.581 --> 00:24:11.316
THAT'S FAR IN EXCESS OF WHAT THE

00:24:11.383 --> 00:24:12.984
STATE -- IS ABOUT PROVIDING FOR

00:24:13.051 --> 00:24:14.820
THE BOOKS PROGRAM ABOUT TEN

00:24:14.886 --> 00:24:16.121
MILLION DOLLARS ACROSS ALL OF

00:24:16.188 --> 00:24:18.156
THE LIBRARY JURISDICTIONS SOME

00:24:18.223 --> 00:24:19.791
OF THEM HAVE A OF MATERIALS

00:24:19.858 --> 00:24:21.226
ACQUISITION BUDGET OF ZERO AND

00:24:21.293 --> 00:24:22.260
SOME OF THEM HAVE.

00:24:22.327 --> 00:24:24.930
LARGER ACQUISITION BUDGET SO --

00:24:24.996 --> 00:24:28.400
IT JUST A QUESTION OF WHICH OF

00:24:28.466 --> 00:24:29.000
THESE LIBRARIES ARE AT HIGHEST

00:24:29.067 --> 00:24:29.201
NEED.

00:24:29.267 --> 00:24:29.901
ANOTHER FACTOR THAT WASN'T

00:24:29.968 --> 00:24:31.169
INCLUDED IN THE PROPOSAL WERE

00:24:31.236 --> 00:24:33.205
OTHER ALTERNATIVES -- TO THE

00:24:33.271 --> 00:24:34.372
BOOKS THAT COULD HELP ROLE

00:24:34.439 --> 00:24:36.107
LIBRARIES ME PATRON DEMAND FOR

00:24:36.174 --> 00:24:37.375
EXAMPLE A BETTER USING

00:24:37.442 --> 00:24:40.145
ELECTRONIC RESOURCES FOR EXAMPLE

00:24:40.212 --> 00:24:42.914
A RATHER THAN PRINT MATERIALS.

00:24:42.981 --> 00:24:43.949
AND THEN FINALLY ON THERE ARE%

00:24:44.015 --> 00:24:45.417
SOME BASIC INFORMATION THAT WE

00:24:45.483 --> 00:24:46.785
HAD REQUESTED FROM THE

00:24:46.852 --> 00:24:48.186
ADMINISTRATION ON HISTORICAL

00:24:48.253 --> 00:24:49.254
SPENDING IN FUNDING IN THE

00:24:49.321 --> 00:24:50.755
PROGRAM IN WHICH LIBRARIES HAVE

00:24:50.822 --> 00:24:52.791
RECEIVED A BOOK PURCHASES AND

00:24:52.858 --> 00:24:54.092
HOW MANY BOOKS HAVE BEEN

00:24:54.159 --> 00:24:55.026
PURCHASED SO FAR.

00:24:55.093 --> 00:24:56.528
AND WE'RE STILL WORKING WITH THE

00:24:56.595 --> 00:24:57.162
ADMINISTRATION ON THAT REQUEST

00:24:57.229 --> 00:24:58.096
WE HAVEN'T.

00:24:58.163 --> 00:24:59.164
SEEN THE DATA YET AND SO WE

00:24:59.231 --> 00:25:00.899
CAN'T COMMENT ON WHETHER THE

00:25:00.966 --> 00:25:02.334
PROJECTED SIXTY THOUSAND BUCKS

00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:04.202
IS IN LINE WITH WHAT THE PROGRAM

00:25:04.269 --> 00:25:04.836
HAS SEEN THUS FAR AND IF THERE'S

00:25:04.903 --> 00:25:08.440
ANY.

00:25:08.506 --> 00:25:10.041
SO SOMEBODY COLLECTING DATA.

00:25:10.108 --> 00:25:11.509
A MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT NORTH

00:25:11.576 --> 00:25:13.011
NET WHICH OVERSEES THE PROGRAM

00:25:13.078 --> 00:25:14.412
GATHERS DATA AND SUBMITS A TO

00:25:14.479 --> 00:25:16.147
THE STATE LIBRARY -- WHERE WE'VE

00:25:16.214 --> 00:25:17.148
BEEN WORKING AGAIN WITHIN

00:25:17.215 --> 00:25:19.017
MINISTRATION ON ON THAT THEY

00:25:19.084 --> 00:25:20.252
INDICATED THAT THEY COULD GET US

00:25:20.318 --> 00:25:21.453
SOME INFORMATION BUT WE HAVEN'T

00:25:21.519 --> 00:25:22.220
SEEN IT YET SO IT'S JUST A

00:25:22.287 --> 00:25:22.988
MATTER OF?

00:25:23.054 --> 00:25:25.557
OF GETTING AT THIS POINT SO WE

00:25:25.624 --> 00:25:28.460
CAN REVIEW IT.

00:25:28.526 --> 00:25:29.594
WE HAVE A PROBLEM GETTING THE

00:25:29.661 --> 00:25:31.062
BOOKS BACK INTO THE LIBRARY

00:25:31.129 --> 00:25:31.997
SYSTEM.

00:25:32.063 --> 00:25:33.999
MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE

00:25:34.065 --> 00:25:35.734
BOOKS GENERALLY ARE RETURNED TO

00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:37.769
THE LIBRARY SYSTEM SOME

00:25:37.836 --> 00:25:39.871
LIBRARIES HAVE A DIFFICULTY --

00:25:39.938 --> 00:25:41.406
TRACKING THE BOOKS SO IF THEY

00:25:41.473 --> 00:25:43.508
DON'T OF BAR CODED PROPERLY IS

00:25:43.575 --> 00:25:44.743
SOMETIMES IT MIGHT GET LOST WITH

00:25:44.809 --> 00:25:45.644
THEIR OTHER BOOKS AND SO THERE'S

00:25:45.710 --> 00:25:46.144
SOME.

00:25:46.211 --> 00:25:47.545
THERE'S SOME DATA ISSUES THERE

00:25:47.612 --> 00:25:48.713
WITH WITH TRACKING WHETHER OR

00:25:48.780 --> 00:25:49.781
NOT THE BOOKS ARE RETURNED MY

00:25:49.848 --> 00:25:51.116
UNDERSTANDING THAT MOST OF THE

00:25:51.182 --> 00:25:52.550
BOOKS ARE RETURNED THERE ARE

00:25:52.617 --> 00:25:54.019
SOME THAT THAT MAY NOT GET

00:25:54.085 --> 00:25:55.620
RETURN BUT THAT DUTCH BASED ON A

00:25:55.687 --> 00:25:56.821
REVIEW THAT WAS DONE OF THE

00:25:56.888 --> 00:25:59.658
PROGRAM A FEW YEARS AGO.

00:25:59.724 --> 00:26:01.826
CLICK AN INNOVATIVE PROGRAM.

00:26:01.893 --> 00:26:04.229
STATE LIBRARIAN -- I'M SORRY I'M

00:26:04.296 --> 00:26:05.463
TO GIVE A RECOMMENDED WITH A

00:26:05.530 --> 00:26:07.365
RECOMMENDATION THAT I WALK YOU

00:26:07.432 --> 00:26:08.333
THROUGH AND I APOLOGIZE ABOUT

00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:10.168
THAT REALLY CUT YOU -- BUDGET

00:26:10.235 --> 00:26:11.770
JUST A RECOMMENDATION THERE ON

00:26:11.836 --> 00:26:13.204
WE WE HAD RECOMMENDED THAT THE

00:26:13.271 --> 00:26:14.940
LEGISLATURE GET AN IMPROVED PLAN

00:26:15.006 --> 00:26:16.675
FIRST FOR THOSE OF BOOKS

00:26:16.741 --> 00:26:17.342
PROPOSAL THAT ADDRESSES SOME OF

00:26:17.409 --> 00:26:21.713
THE CONCERNS WE HAD.

00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:23.348
BECAUSE THE LARGEST BECAUSE IT

00:26:23.415 --> 00:26:23.982
FOR TWO WEEKS AWAY FROM THE MAY

00:26:24.049 --> 00:26:25.850
REVISION -- IT'S IT'S UNLIKELY

00:26:25.917 --> 00:26:28.053
WE GET OUT OF AN UPDATED AND PER

00:26:28.119 --> 00:26:28.620
PLAN IN THAT TIME TO BE IN

00:26:28.687 --> 00:26:30.121
REASONABLE FOR THE CELEBRITY

00:26:30.188 --> 00:26:31.222
DEVELOP THAT PLANTS THE

00:26:31.289 --> 00:26:32.958
LEGISLATURE HAS TWO OPTIONS. ONE

00:26:33.024 --> 00:26:34.626
IS TO REQUEST ADMINISTRATION

00:26:34.693 --> 00:26:35.961
COME BACK NEXT YEAR ANOTHER

00:26:36.027 --> 00:26:37.562
ALTERNATIVE IS TO APPROPRIATE

00:26:37.629 --> 00:26:39.030
THE FUNDS AND CONDITION THE

00:26:39.097 --> 00:26:40.265
RELEASE ON THOSE FUNDS ON ON

00:26:40.332 --> 00:26:41.599
GETTING -- SOME MORE INFORMATION

00:26:41.666 --> 00:26:43.201
AND HAVING A SORT OF DEAL BE SEE

00:26:43.268 --> 00:26:45.170
REVIEW PROCESS.

00:26:45.236 --> 00:26:45.804
SUCH THE RECOMMENDATION WE HAD

00:26:45.870 --> 00:26:48.139
THANK YOU.

00:26:48.206 --> 00:26:49.407
WELL I WOULD ASSUME THAT.

00:26:49.474 --> 00:26:50.108
IT WILL BE SOMEBODY WILL BE

00:26:50.175 --> 00:26:51.309
COLLECTING SOME DATA AND

00:26:51.376 --> 00:26:53.044
CRUNCHING SOME NUMBERS.

00:26:53.111 --> 00:26:54.479
MAKING SURE THAT THE PRO PROGRAM

00:26:54.546 --> 00:26:56.081
IS THE MOST EFFICIENT EFFECTIVE

00:26:56.147 --> 00:26:57.515
WAY BUT IT IT SEEMS SORT OF

00:26:57.582 --> 00:26:58.683
INNOVATIVE TO ME WE'RE NOT

00:26:58.750 --> 00:27:00.585
APPROVING ANYTHING TODAY TO HOLD

00:27:00.652 --> 00:27:03.388
OPEN ITEM BUT THANK YOU.

00:27:03.455 --> 00:27:04.923
SIR SAID SINCE YOU'RE HOLDING

00:27:04.990 --> 00:27:06.825
THE ITEM OPENID WOULD THANK YOU

00:27:06.891 --> 00:27:08.626
FOR THAT AND TALKED AFTER THE

00:27:08.693 --> 00:27:09.194
MAY REVISION.

00:27:09.260 --> 00:27:10.862
I WANNA HAVE A FURTHER

00:27:10.929 --> 00:27:12.564
DISCUSSION OR I THINK IF YOU

00:27:12.630 --> 00:27:14.132
KNOW A BOOK ANYTHING ELSE IT'S

00:27:14.199 --> 00:27:15.533
NOT A HUGE AMOUNT OF MONEY IT'S

00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:16.835
AN INNOVATIVE PROGRAM IF IT

00:27:16.901 --> 00:27:18.470
SERVES PEOPLE IN RURAL AREAS WHO

00:27:18.536 --> 00:27:19.637
WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE TROUBLE

00:27:19.704 --> 00:27:22.140
GETTING TO LIBRARIES AND

00:27:22.207 --> 00:27:23.108
SECURING BOOKS AND WE SEEM TO

00:27:23.174 --> 00:27:23.775
GET THE BOOKS.

00:27:23.842 --> 00:27:25.810
BACK INTO THE SYSTEM IT'S ABOUT

00:27:25.877 --> 00:27:28.380
80% RETURN RIGHT -- IF YOU YOU

00:27:28.446 --> 00:27:29.581
KNOW CATTY CORNER FROM YOUR

00:27:29.647 --> 00:27:31.416
DISTRICT OFFICE HE WALKED TO THE

00:27:31.483 --> 00:27:32.851
MAIN LIBRARY RIVERSIDE USES THAT

00:27:32.917 --> 00:27:34.986
MAKE HIM RIGHT AND WHAT GIVE YOU

00:27:35.053 --> 00:27:36.254
CHAPTER AND VERSE ON THE

00:27:36.321 --> 00:27:37.822
CUSTOMER SERVICE IN THE

00:27:37.889 --> 00:27:39.257
POPULARITY THAT IT HAS.

00:27:39.324 --> 00:27:40.558
BUT I'M SURE THERE'S A WAY TO

00:27:40.625 --> 00:27:41.960
YOU KNOW QUANTIFY THE EFFECT

00:27:42.027 --> 00:27:43.128
YEAH PROGRAM OVER TIME AND

00:27:43.194 --> 00:27:44.496
THAT'S PROBABLY WHAT WE SHOULD

00:27:44.562 --> 00:27:45.663
BE LOOKING AT THE NEXT TIME

00:27:45.730 --> 00:27:47.065
AROUND FOR SURE.

00:27:47.132 --> 00:27:48.566
IF NOT BEFORE YEAH IT'S BEEN

00:27:48.633 --> 00:27:51.369
INTERESTING FOR HOW HUGE -- AS

00:27:51.436 --> 00:27:53.738
AMAZON IS -- THEY HAVE

00:27:53.805 --> 00:27:55.874
DIFFICULTY DEALING WITH LARGE

00:27:55.940 --> 00:28:00.011
GROUP CLIENTS AND THAT'S THAT'S

00:28:00.078 --> 00:28:00.845
BEEN AN ISSUE THAT WE'VE.

00:28:00.912 --> 00:28:01.646
I MEAN IT'S A LONGER DISCUSSION

00:28:01.713 --> 00:28:02.447
BUT IT'S AN ISSUE WE'RE WORKING

00:28:02.514 --> 00:28:03.848
ON THAT'S GOING TO ALLOW THE

00:28:03.915 --> 00:28:05.083
EASIER.

00:28:05.150 --> 00:28:06.785
COLLECTION OF THE DATA WITH WHAT

00:28:06.851 --> 00:28:08.319
WE'RE DOING WITH THE HANDS ON

00:28:08.386 --> 00:28:10.121
PERFECT.

00:28:10.188 --> 00:28:12.157
TELL YOU ANY QUESTIONS.

00:28:12.223 --> 00:28:14.359
NOT LET'S MOVE ON ISSUE NUMBER

00:28:14.426 --> 00:28:18.329
THREE LUNCH AT THE LIBRARY.

00:28:18.396 --> 00:28:20.765
THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSES

00:28:20.832 --> 00:28:21.332
ONE MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL

00:28:21.399 --> 00:28:23.501
FUND. TO SUPPORT THE LUNCH AT

00:28:23.568 --> 00:28:26.137
THE LIBRARIES PROGRAM -- THESE --

00:28:26.204 --> 00:28:27.806
INVESTMENTS ARE INTENDED TO

00:28:27.872 --> 00:28:29.274
ENABLE LOCAL LIBRARIES TO DRAW

00:28:29.340 --> 00:28:32.844
DOWN -- FEDERAL -- FUNDING TO

00:28:32.911 --> 00:28:35.013
SUPPORT AT SUMMER LUNCH PROGRAMS

00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:36.981
TO THE LIBRARY -- THIS WAS FIRST

00:28:37.048 --> 00:28:39.717
FUNDED -- IN THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN

00:28:39.784 --> 00:28:40.518
NINETEEN BUDGET WHAT THEY ONE

00:28:40.585 --> 00:28:42.687
MILLION ONE TIME AUGMENTATION AS

00:28:42.754 --> 00:28:43.321
WELL [inaudible]

00:28:43.388 --> 00:28:45.557
HELLO.

00:28:45.623 --> 00:28:47.058
OUR SYSTEM THE RECOMMENDATION IS

00:28:47.125 --> 00:28:48.359
GOING TO SOUND SOMEWHAT SIMILAR

00:28:48.426 --> 00:28:50.528
TO THE PREVIOUS ITEM. FOR SOME

00:28:50.595 --> 00:28:52.097
FURTHER CONTEXT AND WHAT WHAT

00:28:52.163 --> 00:28:53.531
THE STATE FUNDS TO BE USED FOR

00:28:53.598 --> 00:28:55.333
THIS PROPOSAL AS PART OF A

00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:56.935
LARGER FEDERAL PROGRAM.

00:28:57.001 --> 00:28:58.703
THAT PROVIDES FREE MEALS TO

00:28:58.770 --> 00:28:59.971
STUDENTS IN THE SUMMER AND THE

00:29:00.038 --> 00:29:01.106
OVERARCHING PURPOSE OF THIS

00:29:01.172 --> 00:29:02.807
FEDERAL PROGRAM IS TO ENSURE

00:29:02.874 --> 00:29:04.375
STUDENTS HAVE ACCESS TO

00:29:04.442 --> 00:29:06.444
SUBSIDIZE MEALS IN THE SUMMER --

00:29:06.511 --> 00:29:08.646
BECAUSE THEY'RE OTHERWISE NOT

00:29:08.713 --> 00:29:09.214
ATTENDING SCHOOL WHERE THEY

00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:10.081
RECEIVED.

00:29:10.148 --> 00:29:12.183
A SUBSIDIZED MEAL DURING THE

00:29:12.250 --> 00:29:14.452
FALL THROUGH SPRING.

00:29:14.519 --> 00:29:16.721
THE FEDERAL PROGRAM ITSELF FUNDS

00:29:16.788 --> 00:29:19.057
THE MEALS AND SO THE STATE

00:29:19.124 --> 00:29:20.592
FUNDING HERE.

00:29:20.658 --> 00:29:22.494
RATHER THAN FOR THE MEALS ARE OR

00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:23.061
FOR ACTIVITIES THAT ARE IN

00:29:23.128 --> 00:29:24.562
SUPPORT OF THOSE -- MEALS SO FOR

00:29:24.629 --> 00:29:26.231
EXAMPLE A PORTION OF THE FUNDING

00:29:26.297 --> 00:29:27.999
WOULD BE FOR STAFF TIME TO TO

00:29:28.066 --> 00:29:29.534
PROVIDE OUTREACH AND SUPPORT TO

00:29:29.601 --> 00:29:30.235
LIBRARIES.

00:29:30.301 --> 00:29:31.736
WHO WANT?

00:29:31.803 --> 00:29:32.370
TO BECOME PART OF THE FEDERAL

00:29:32.437 --> 00:29:34.139
SYSTEM ANOTHER PORTION OF THE

00:29:34.205 --> 00:29:35.106
FUNDING WOULD.

00:29:35.173 --> 00:29:36.207
PROVIDE STARTUP FUNDING FOR

00:29:36.274 --> 00:29:37.542
LIBRARIES THAT WANT TO BECOME

00:29:37.609 --> 00:29:39.511
SITES TO PROVIDE MEALS ANOTHER

00:29:39.577 --> 00:29:40.111
PERSON THE FUNDING WOULD ALSO

00:29:40.178 --> 00:29:41.646
SUPPORT I'M VERY SUMMER

00:29:41.713 --> 00:29:43.214
ENRICHMENT PROGRAMS FOR STUDENTS

00:29:43.281 --> 00:29:43.882
THAT.

00:29:43.948 --> 00:29:45.550
ARE AVAILABLE TO THEM WHEN THEY

00:29:45.617 --> 00:29:47.852
ALSO WHEN THEY RECEIVE A FREE

00:29:47.919 --> 00:29:49.787
MEAL AT A LIBRARY.

00:29:49.854 --> 00:29:51.089
IN REVIEWING THIS PROPOSAL WE

00:29:51.156 --> 00:29:52.056
THINK THE ADMINISTRATION HAS

00:29:52.123 --> 00:29:53.758
IDENTIFIED A CEILING ISSUE FOR

00:29:53.825 --> 00:29:54.726
THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER

00:29:54.792 --> 00:29:57.262
WHICH IS -- FOR A FOOD AND

00:29:57.328 --> 00:29:57.896
SECURITY AMONG CHILDREN IN THE

00:29:57.962 --> 00:29:58.396
STATE.

00:29:58.463 --> 00:30:01.966
DATA SUGGESTS THAT ABOUT 19% OF

00:30:02.033 --> 00:30:03.334
CHILDREN IN THE STATE

00:30:03.401 --> 00:30:05.103
EXPERIENCED FOOD INSECURITY WHAT

00:30:05.170 --> 00:30:06.437
THE RATES UP.

00:30:06.504 --> 00:30:08.072
BIG TENDING TO BE HIGHER IN IN

00:30:08.139 --> 00:30:09.140
THE INLAND PARTS OF THE STATE

00:30:09.207 --> 00:30:13.545
VERSUS -- THE MORE URBAN PARTS.

00:30:13.611 --> 00:30:14.579
I'M.

00:30:14.646 --> 00:30:15.313
IN TERMS IT WITH THEIR ISN'T

00:30:15.380 --> 00:30:17.048
DATA ON THE SEASONALITY OF THAT

00:30:17.115 --> 00:30:18.449
BUT IT'S POSSIBLE THAT FOOD

00:30:18.516 --> 00:30:19.918
SECURITY INCREASES IN THE SUMMER

00:30:19.984 --> 00:30:21.953
WHEN STUDENTS AREN'T IN SCHOOL

00:30:22.020 --> 00:30:24.355
AND NOT RECEIVING A FREE MEAL.

00:30:24.422 --> 00:30:25.490
WE ALSO.

00:30:25.557 --> 00:30:28.059
UNDERSTAND THAT BY TRYING TO

00:30:28.126 --> 00:30:28.660
LEVERAGE MORE FUNDING THROUGH

00:30:28.726 --> 00:30:31.196
THE SUMMER MEAL PROGRAM IN ORDER

00:30:31.262 --> 00:30:32.163
TO ADDRESS FOR IN SECURITY WE

00:30:32.230 --> 00:30:33.398
UNDERSTAND THAT THE

00:30:33.464 --> 00:30:34.465
ADMINISTRATION AND STATE LIBRARY.

00:30:34.532 --> 00:30:35.533
IS TRYING TO LEVERAGE MORE

00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:36.701
FEDERAL FUNDS IN ORDER TO

00:30:36.768 --> 00:30:38.703
ADDRESS THIS ISSUE AND WE ALSO

00:30:38.770 --> 00:30:39.237
THINK THAT'S A REASONABLE

00:30:39.304 --> 00:30:40.171
APPROACH.

00:30:40.238 --> 00:30:41.606
OUR CONCERN HERE IS THAT BY

00:30:41.673 --> 00:30:43.708
FOCUSING SPECIFICALLY ON ON

00:30:43.775 --> 00:30:45.476
FEDERATION NEW LIBRARY SITES.

00:30:45.543 --> 00:30:47.579
THE PROPOSAL IS SOMEWHAT NARROW

00:30:47.645 --> 00:30:49.147
IN FOCUS A WEBER IS OR JUST A

00:30:49.214 --> 00:30:51.249
SUBSET OF PROVIDERS THAT CAN

00:30:51.316 --> 00:30:52.617
PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM.

00:30:52.684 --> 00:30:54.419
OUR SCHOOLS ARE A KEY PROVIDER

00:30:54.485 --> 00:30:56.154
IN ADDITION OF NON PROFITS IN

00:30:56.221 --> 00:30:57.555
OTHER LOCAL ENTITIES CAN SERVICE

00:30:57.622 --> 00:30:58.590
SITES.

00:30:58.656 --> 00:30:59.757
AND IN ADDITION TO THAT --

00:30:59.824 --> 00:31:01.025
THERE'S SOME THERE'S MANY

00:31:01.092 --> 00:31:02.527
FACTORS THAT LIKELY EXPLAIN MY

00:31:02.594 --> 00:31:03.795
STUDENTS MAY NOT.

00:31:03.861 --> 00:31:04.762
RECEIVE A FREE MEAL IN THE

00:31:04.829 --> 00:31:06.531
SUMMER AND GO TO A SITE -- ONE

00:31:06.598 --> 00:31:07.498
OF THEM IS THAT THERE MAY NOT BE

00:31:07.565 --> 00:31:08.733
ENOUGH SITES ESPECIALLY IF

00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:09.934
THEY'RE IN A RURAL AREA.

00:31:10.001 --> 00:31:11.035
THERE COULD BE OTHER FACTORS TO

00:31:11.102 --> 00:31:13.871
LIKE LACK OF AWARENESS OF THE

00:31:13.938 --> 00:31:16.007
PROGRAM -- WE THINK BY FOCUSING

00:31:16.074 --> 00:31:16.908
JUST ON WAIVERS AND JUST ON THE

00:31:16.975 --> 00:31:18.409
SITES THE DEMONSTRATIONS JUST

00:31:18.476 --> 00:31:19.978
FOCUSING ON ONE ON ONE

00:31:20.044 --> 00:31:21.879
PARTICULAR ISSUE AND NOT AT

00:31:21.946 --> 00:31:22.447
ADDRESSING THE PROBLEM MORE

00:31:22.513 --> 00:31:24.215
HOLISTICALLY.

00:31:24.282 --> 00:31:25.250
SO WE RECOMMEND THAT THE

00:31:25.316 --> 00:31:26.584
LEGISLATURE DIRECTION OF THE

00:31:26.651 --> 00:31:28.119
ADMINISTRATION IN STATE LIBRARY

00:31:28.186 --> 00:31:29.287
TO WORK WITH THE CALIFORNIA

00:31:29.354 --> 00:31:31.189
DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION WHICH IS

00:31:31.256 --> 00:31:32.490
PRIMARILY RESPONSIBLE FOR

00:31:32.557 --> 00:31:34.559
OVERSEEING THE FEDERAL PROGRAM A

00:31:34.626 --> 00:31:36.361
IN CALIFORNIA. TO DEVELOP -- A

00:31:36.427 --> 00:31:37.929
MORE COMPREHENSIVE PLAN THAT

00:31:37.996 --> 00:31:39.097
ADDRESSES SOME OF THESE ISSUES

00:31:39.163 --> 00:31:40.865
SO FOR EXAMPLE THE PLAN WOULD

00:31:40.932 --> 00:31:42.934
PROPOSE ALWAYS TARGET RESOURCES

00:31:43.001 --> 00:31:44.936
IN REGIONS WHERE FOOD SECURITY

00:31:45.003 --> 00:31:45.370
IS HIGHER.

00:31:45.436 --> 00:31:47.238
IT WOULD INVITE ALL ENTITIES TO

00:31:47.305 --> 00:31:48.673
OF APPLY FOR THE FUNDING NOT

00:31:48.740 --> 00:31:49.941
JUST THE LIBRARIES FOR EXAMPLE

00:31:50.008 --> 00:31:51.709
BUT ALSO SCHOOLS NONPROFITS

00:31:51.776 --> 00:31:54.812
OTHER UP PROVIDERS WHO CAN SERVE

00:31:54.879 --> 00:31:56.648
THEIR COMMUNITIES.

00:31:56.714 --> 00:31:58.116
I WOULD ALSO IDENTIFY PLANNED IT

00:31:58.182 --> 00:31:58.750
TO TO TRACK DATA NOW COMES OVER

00:31:58.816 --> 00:32:00.685
TIME.

00:32:00.752 --> 00:32:02.053
NOW AS I AS I SAID IN THE BOOKS

00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:03.354
PROGRAM GIVEN THE SHORT TIME

00:32:03.421 --> 00:32:04.922
FRAME HERE IT PROBABLY THIS PLAN

00:32:04.989 --> 00:32:06.991
COVER PROBABLY CAN BE DEVELOPED --

ADEQUATELY MET BY THE CURRENT

00:46:36.894 --> 00:46:39.062
SYSTEM.

00:46:39.129 --> 00:46:40.264
THAT BEING SAID WE HAVE A NUMBER

00:46:40.330 --> 00:46:41.598
OF CONCERNS WITH THE PROPOSAL AS

00:46:41.665 --> 00:46:43.800
IT'S CURRENTLY STRUCTURED.

00:46:43.867 --> 00:46:45.502
LISTED ON PAGE TWENTY TWO OF

00:46:45.569 --> 00:46:46.703
YOUR DONDE ABOUT HALFWAY DOWN

00:46:46.770 --> 00:46:49.473
THE PAGE.

00:46:49.540 --> 00:46:50.807
THE FIRST FOUR CONCERNS IS THAT

00:46:50.874 --> 00:46:52.342
THE LEGISLATURE HAS IN THE PAST

00:46:52.409 --> 00:46:54.111
FEW YEARS INDICATEDAN INTEREST

00:46:54.178 --> 00:46:55.479
IN SIMPLIFYING THE HEALTH AND

00:46:55.546 --> 00:46:56.647
SYSTEM.

00:46:56.713 --> 00:46:57.581
IN STREAMLINING THE MANY

00:46:57.648 --> 00:46:58.882
DIFFERENT RULES COVERING

00:46:58.949 --> 00:47:01.685
ELIGIBILITY AND WHAT SITES.

00:47:01.752 --> 00:47:02.786
THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL WOULD

00:47:02.853 --> 00:47:04.488
RUN COUNTER TO THESE EFFORTS BY

00:47:04.555 --> 00:47:06.857
INTRODUCING A NEW SET OF RULES

00:47:06.924 --> 00:47:08.992
THAT ARE SPECIFIC TO ONE SUB A

00:47:09.059 --> 00:47:11.962
FINANCIALLY NEEDY STUDENTS.

00:47:12.029 --> 00:47:14.064
WE ALSO RELATED DISTRIBUTIONAL

00:47:14.131 --> 00:47:14.998
CONCERN.

00:47:15.065 --> 00:47:16.033
WHETHER STUDENT HAS CHILDREN

00:47:16.099 --> 00:47:17.634
SENT ME DOES THE FACT THEIR

00:47:17.701 --> 00:47:18.769
FINANCIAL NEED.

00:47:18.835 --> 00:47:20.270
BUT THERE ARE ALSO VARIOUS OTHER

00:47:20.337 --> 00:47:21.605
FACTORS THAT SHAPE THE STUDENT'S

00:47:21.672 --> 00:47:23.040
OVERALL NEED INCLUDING THE

00:47:23.106 --> 00:47:26.710
HOUSEHOLD INCOME ASSETS IN.

00:47:26.777 --> 00:47:28.245
FIVE BY TARGETING ADDITIONAL AID

00:47:28.312 --> 00:47:29.446
ACCORDING TO ONE COMPONENT OF

00:47:29.513 --> 00:47:31.515
OVERALL NEED WE ARE CONSENT THE

00:47:31.582 --> 00:47:32.349
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL WITH ME

00:47:32.416 --> 00:47:34.051
ABOUT SOME STUDENTS WITH HIGH

00:47:34.117 --> 00:47:34.484
OVERALL.

00:47:34.551 --> 00:47:36.253
NEED.

00:47:36.320 --> 00:47:39.156
WHO DO NOT HAVE CHILDREN?

00:47:39.223 --> 00:47:40.090
WHEN WE WERE ALSO CONCERNED THAT

00:47:40.157 --> 00:47:41.658
THE PROPOSAL WOULD BE ABOUT A

00:47:41.725 --> 00:47:43.193
LARGE NUMBER OF STUDENTS PARENTS

00:47:43.260 --> 00:47:44.361
WITH FINANCIAL?

00:47:44.428 --> 00:47:45.762
THIS GOES BACK TO THE EARLIER

00:47:45.829 --> 00:47:46.897
POINT THAT MOST STUDENTS PARENTS

00:47:46.964 --> 00:47:48.265
ARE SIR AFTER THE COMPETITIVE

00:47:48.332 --> 00:47:49.299
PROGRAM.

00:47:49.366 --> 00:47:50.400
GIVEN THE COP ON COMPETITIVE

00:47:50.467 --> 00:47:51.969
AWARDS THIS MEANS THAT ONLY A

00:47:52.035 --> 00:47:53.537
MINORITY OF STUDENTS PARENTS

00:47:53.604 --> 00:47:55.138
WITH FINANCIAL NEED ACTUALLY

00:47:55.205 --> 00:47:56.640
RECEIVE A CALL.

00:47:56.707 --> 00:47:57.841
THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL WOULD

00:47:57.908 --> 00:47:59.076
NOT PROVIDE ADDITIONAL AID TO

00:47:59.142 --> 00:47:59.743
THOSE STUDENTS WHO ARE

00:47:59.810 --> 00:48:01.778
FINANCIALLY ELIGIBLE FOR BUT NOT

00:48:01.845 --> 00:48:04.414
OFFERED CAL GRANT IT IS A LIMON

00:48:04.481 --> 00:48:05.749
UNCOMPETITIVE AWARD.

00:48:05.816 --> 00:48:06.817
IT ALSO WOULD NOT PROVIDE

00:48:06.883 --> 00:48:07.684
ADDITIONAL AID TO STUDENTS

00:48:07.751 --> 00:48:08.952
PARENTS WITH FINANCIAL NEED

00:48:09.019 --> 00:48:09.419
ATTENDING THE PRIVATE

00:48:09.486 --> 00:48:12.623
INSTITUTION. FOR THESE REASONS

00:48:12.689 --> 00:48:13.824
WE DO RECOMMEND REJECTING THE

00:48:13.890 --> 00:48:15.759
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL.

00:48:15.826 --> 00:48:16.827
AND THAT RAISES IMPORTANT

00:48:16.893 --> 00:48:18.495
QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER OUR

00:48:18.562 --> 00:48:19.696
CURRENT SYSTEMS ARE ADEQUATELY

00:48:19.763 --> 00:48:21.098
MEETING THE NEEDS OF THIS

00:48:21.164 --> 00:48:22.266
POPULATION.

00:48:22.332 --> 00:48:23.066
AND SO WE KNOW THAT THE

00:48:23.133 --> 00:48:25.002
LEGISLATURE MAY WISH TO PURSUE

00:48:25.068 --> 00:48:25.569
FURTHER INFORMATION ON THIS

00:48:25.636 --> 00:48:27.337
TOPIC.

00:48:27.404 --> 00:48:29.006
THAT WOULD REQUIRE A BETTER

00:48:29.072 --> 00:48:30.274
UNDERSTANDING THE COSTS THAT

00:48:30.340 --> 00:48:31.975
STUDENT PRINT SPACE BUT ALSO A

00:48:32.042 --> 00:48:33.043
BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE

00:48:33.110 --> 00:48:34.611
RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO STUDENTS

00:48:34.678 --> 00:48:36.713
PARENTS BOTH THROUGH OUR STUDENT

00:48:36.780 --> 00:48:37.848
FINANCIAL AID SYSTEM.

00:48:37.914 --> 00:48:39.349
AND THROUGH OTHER SOCIAL SERVICE

00:48:39.416 --> 00:48:43.654
PROGRAMS SUCH AS OUR WELL GIVEN

00:48:43.720 --> 00:48:46.723
THE DELTA BETWEEN THE NUMBER OF

00:48:46.790 --> 00:48:48.292
APPLICANTS FOR THE COMPETITIVE

00:48:48.358 --> 00:48:49.593
PROGRAM IN THOSE IT ACTUALLY

00:48:49.660 --> 00:48:51.361
RECEIVE AN AWARD MY RECOLLECTION

00:48:51.428 --> 00:48:54.331
IS IT SOMETHING LIKE THIRTY

00:48:54.398 --> 00:48:54.865
THOUSAND TO THREE HUNDRED

00:48:54.931 --> 00:48:56.466
THOUSAND GIVE OR TAKE.

00:48:56.533 --> 00:48:59.336
DO WE KNOW IF WE TOOK THIS THE

00:48:59.403 --> 00:49:01.038
TOTAL MONEY THAT WE HAD.

00:49:01.104 --> 00:49:01.638
HAVE.

00:49:01.705 --> 00:49:04.074
LIED TO THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL.

00:49:04.141 --> 00:49:05.676
AND WHAT AND WE APPLIED INSTEAD

00:49:05.742 --> 00:49:07.010
TO INCREASING THE NUMBER OF

00:49:07.077 --> 00:49:09.146
COMPETITIVE GRANTS SO MANY

00:49:09.212 --> 00:49:12.015
GRANTS THAT WOULD ADD.

00:49:12.082 --> 00:49:12.749
ASSESSMENT OF THE COMPETITIVE

00:49:12.816 --> 00:49:13.750
WORDS PROPOSAL THAT WILL BE

00:49:13.817 --> 00:49:15.185
DISCUSSING IN THE NEXT ISSUE.

00:49:15.252 --> 00:49:16.553
WE ESTIMATED THAT FOR EVERY

00:49:16.620 --> 00:49:18.755
ADDITIONAL ONE MILLION DOLLARS

00:49:18.822 --> 00:49:19.323
WE PUT INTO THE COMPETITIVE

00:49:19.389 --> 00:49:20.657
PROGRAM.

00:49:20.724 --> 00:49:23.093
COULD RAISE THE CALIFORNIA WHERE

00:49:23.160 --> 00:49:25.562
I ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED AND FORTY

00:49:25.629 --> 00:49:27.197
THAT BEING SAID AS THIS NEW

00:49:27.264 --> 00:49:27.798
AWARDS CONVERTER NOODLES THAT

00:49:27.864 --> 00:49:29.633
COST WOULD INCREASE OVER THE

00:49:29.700 --> 00:49:30.200
COMING YEARS AND SO WE WOULD

00:49:30.267 --> 00:49:31.001
NEED.

00:49:31.068 --> 00:49:32.069
TO MORE THOUGHTFULLY MODEL THAT

00:49:32.135 --> 00:49:34.204
IF WE WERE TO PROPOSE SHIFTING

00:49:34.271 --> 00:49:36.173
THE HUNDRED TWENTY TWO MILLION

00:49:36.239 --> 00:49:36.673
FROM THE STUDENT PARENTS

00:49:36.740 --> 00:49:37.507
PROPOSAL.

00:49:37.574 --> 00:49:39.543
DIRECTLY INTO THE COMPUTER

00:49:39.609 --> 00:49:41.411
PROGRAM SO IT'S ABOUT. FOUR

00:49:41.478 --> 00:49:42.045
THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED FOR EVERY

00:49:42.112 --> 00:49:44.181
TEN MILLION.

00:49:44.247 --> 00:49:45.982
THAT'S RIGHT IF I WERE IF I KNEW

00:49:46.049 --> 00:49:46.616
MATH THERE WOULDN'T BE A LAWYER

00:49:46.683 --> 00:49:51.254
BUT AND SO WE DO WE GET TO ABOUT

00:49:51.321 --> 00:49:51.855
THIRTEEN THOUSAND ADDITIONAL.

00:49:51.922 --> 00:49:53.490
GIVE OR TAKE COMPETITIVE GRANTS

00:49:53.557 --> 00:49:55.158
WHAT'S IF WE TOOK THE THIRTY

00:49:55.225 --> 00:49:56.426
THREE MILLION AND WE SIMPLY

00:49:56.493 --> 00:49:57.361
INCREASE THE NUMBER OF

00:49:57.427 --> 00:49:58.195
COMPETITIVE [inaudible]

00:49:58.261 --> 00:50:00.497
GRANT.

00:50:00.564 --> 00:50:05.268
COMPETITIVE SLOTS AVAILABLE.

00:50:05.335 --> 00:50:09.740
MY MENTAL MATH IS NOT THAT GREAT.

00:50:09.806 --> 00:50:11.341
I GET IT SO.

00:50:11.408 --> 00:50:12.909
THAT'S CERTAINLY AN ISSUE AND

00:50:12.976 --> 00:50:14.544
THEN BY DOING SO WE WOULD.

00:50:14.611 --> 00:50:17.814
BE ABLE TO IMPACT MORE --

00:50:17.881 --> 00:50:20.517
STUDENT PARENTS.

00:50:20.584 --> 00:50:21.985
THAT'S RIGHT ONE OF OUR CONCERNS

00:50:22.052 --> 00:50:23.186
WITH THIS PROPOSAL IS JUST

00:50:23.253 --> 00:50:24.187
BECAUSE THE LIMIT ON COMPETITIVE

00:50:24.254 --> 00:50:25.722
AWARDS THAT WOULD LIMIT OUR

00:50:25.789 --> 00:50:27.591
ABILITY TO BUY ADDITIONAL AID TO

00:50:27.657 --> 00:50:30.160
THE STUDENT PARENTS WHO ARE.

00:50:30.227 --> 00:50:32.329
ELIGIBLE FOR BUT NOT OFTEN.

00:50:32.396 --> 00:50:34.731
LEAVE ANY QUESTIONS.

00:50:34.798 --> 00:50:36.833
SENATOR IF I MAY. ONE THING TO

00:50:36.900 --> 00:50:38.735
BE VERY MINDFUL OF IN IN LOOKING

00:50:38.802 --> 00:50:40.036
AT THE COMPETITIVE WARTS IS THAT

00:50:40.103 --> 00:50:41.671
AS THOSE AWARDS A RENEWED IN THE

00:50:41.738 --> 00:50:42.506
OUT YEARS.

00:50:42.572 --> 00:50:44.841
THE COSTS INCREASE BEYOND THOSE

00:50:44.908 --> 00:50:46.643
IN THE FIRST YEAR SO WHILE IT

00:50:46.710 --> 00:50:48.612
MAY BE ROUGHLY ONE MILLION PER

00:50:48.678 --> 00:50:49.980
FOUR HUNDRED AND FORTY THAT

00:50:50.046 --> 00:50:51.648
COULD BE ONE POINT FIVE MILLION

00:50:51.715 --> 00:50:52.816
THE FOLLOWING YEAR AND TWO

00:50:52.883 --> 00:50:54.451
MILLION THE SUBSEQUENT YEAR.

00:50:54.518 --> 00:50:55.952
AND IF IT CAN BE VERY VOLATILE

00:50:56.019 --> 00:50:57.454
DEPENDING ON WHICH SEGMENT THE

00:50:57.521 --> 00:51:00.924
AWARD SHOWS UP IN A WHETHER IT.

00:51:00.991 --> 00:51:02.325
COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND THE

00:51:02.392 --> 00:51:04.528
INCREASED ROUTE REFRESH ME THE

00:51:04.594 --> 00:51:08.799
INCREASES BECAUSE SOMETHING ELSE

00:51:08.865 --> 00:51:11.701
IS ADDED TO THE MIX.

00:51:11.768 --> 00:51:13.003
IT'S BECAUSE THERE ARE ARE.

00:51:13.069 --> 00:51:14.371
HEY LET'S SAY EVERY THOUSAND

00:51:14.438 --> 00:51:16.406
AWARD YOU WERE TO ADD YOU HAVE A

00:51:16.473 --> 00:51:17.507
NUMBER OF THOSE AWARDS THAT WERE

ARGUABLY -- JUST WANT TO SAVE

00:52:07.724 --> 00:52:08.124
MISTER NICK EMISSIONS

00:52:08.191 --> 00:52:09.593
PERSPECTIVE THAT WE DO

00:52:09.659 --> 00:52:11.194

COLLEGE STUDENTS THAT -- THEIR

00:52:17.567 --> 00:52:18.869
FINANCIALLY SYSTEM WE HAVE WAS

00:52:18.935 --> 00:52:21.071
DESIGNED FOR A DIFFERENT TYPE OF

00:52:21.137 --> 00:52:22.606
STUDENT AT A DIFFERENT ERA.

00:52:22.672 --> 00:52:24.341
AND BY RECOGNIZING SPECIFICALLY

00:52:24.407 --> 00:52:26.142
THAT THIS ONE POPULATION STUDENT

00:52:26.209 --> 00:52:27.878
PARENTS FACES UNIQUE BURDENS AND

00:52:27.944 --> 00:52:29.145
COSTS WE THINK THAT THAT

00:52:29.212 --> 00:52:31.114
REPRESENTS -- AT THE VERY LEAST

00:52:31.181 --> 00:52:33.183
A GREAT STARTING POINT. FOR THE

00:52:33.250 --> 00:52:34.951
DISCUSSIONS AROUND RESHAPING AND

00:52:35.018 --> 00:52:36.219
EXPAND THE FINANCIAL AID SYSTEM

00:52:36.286 --> 00:52:37.654
THAT WE'VE BEEN HAVING WITH

00:52:37.721 --> 00:52:39.756
STAKEHOLDERS SUCH AS OUR SEGMENT

00:52:39.823 --> 00:52:41.658

THIS BUT IF YOU OPEN AN ANALYSIS.

00:52:47.531 --> 00:52:51.434
ON THE ISSUE THAT I WAS JUST

00:52:51.501 --> 00:52:52.135
DISCUSSING THE INCREASING THE

00:52:52.202 --> 00:52:52.802
TOTAL NUMBER OF COMPETITIVE

00:52:52.869 --> 00:52:54.304

THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL HERE AND

00:52:58.074 --> 00:52:59.476
WHAT THAT IMPACT WOULD BE IN

WHICH IS BETTER AND WHICH

00:53:00.677 --> 00:53:02.412
IMPACTS MORE PEOPLE.

00:53:02.479 --> 00:53:04.247
CERTAINLY I'M I DON'T BELIEVE WE

00:53:04.314 --> 00:53:05.749
HAVE A FINAL NUMBER YET AND IT

00:53:05.815 --> 00:53:07.150
IS IMPORTANT TO LET AND

00:53:07.217 --> 00:53:08.985
RECOGNIZE THE ISSUE THAT MR

00:53:09.052 --> 00:53:11.755

00:53:11.821 --> 00:53:13.456

USE THE GRANT FOR JUST ONE YEAR.

00:53:31.775 --> 00:53:33.076
IT WOULD BE IN THE RANGE OF

00:53:33.143 --> 00:53:34.277
ABOUT FIFTY THOUSAND NEW AWARDS

00:53:34.344 --> 00:53:35.378
BUT WHAT WE'RE STILL WORKING ON

00:53:35.445 --> 00:53:37.714
DOING IS MAKING SURE THAT WE CAN

00:53:37.781 --> 00:53:39.449
APPLY PROJECT. TO THAT TO THAT

00:53:39.516 --> 00:53:40.517
DOES NOT OVERSTATE THE

00:53:40.584 --> 00:53:42.452
AVAILABILITY IT WOULD LIKELY BE

00:53:42.519 --> 00:53:44.387
SOMEWHERE AROUND THIS IS A VERY

WARD SO THEORETICALLY IF THAT

00:54:11.982 --> 00:54:13.216
WERE THE DIRECTION FROM THE

00:54:13.283 --> 00:54:15.685
LEGISLATURE WE COULD INCORPORATE

IS IT BETTER TO DO IT THIS WAY

00:54:27.364 --> 00:54:30.100
OR THIS WAY THAT'S THE ESSENCE

00:54:30.166 --> 00:54:31.501
OF MY QUESTION.

00:54:34.304 --> 00:54:39.709
THE FACT THAT THAT POPULATION --

00:54:39.776 --> 00:54:40.810
FROM IF YOU'RE NUMERICAL

00:54:40.877 --> 00:54:42.879
PERSPECTIVE IT APPEARS THAT THE

00:54:42.946 --> 00:54:44.147
ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL.

00:54:44.214 --> 00:54:46.082
WOULD HELP A GREATER NUMBER OF

00:54:46.149 --> 00:54:47.951
STUDENTS IN THAT POPULATION POOL

00:54:48.018 --> 00:54:49.452
BECAUSE IT IS IT.

00:54:49.519 --> 00:54:51.121

NUMBER OF COMPETITIVE CAL GRANT

00:55:03.199 --> 00:55:05.135
AWARDS WOULD HAVE THE SIDE

00:55:05.201 --> 00:55:07.337
EFFECT OF INCREASING THE NUMBER

00:55:07.404 --> 00:55:07.871
WERE TO GO TO THAT STUDENT

00:55:07.937 --> 00:55:09.706
POPULATION.

00:55:09.773 --> 00:55:10.273
BUT IT WOULD BE FAR FROM A

00:55:10.340 --> 00:55:11.174
GUARANTEE.

00:55:11.241 --> 00:55:12.108
I'M AS OPPOSED TO THE

00:55:12.175 --> 00:55:13.743
ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL WOULD

ENSURE THAT WITHOUT THOSE

00:55:16.479 --> 00:55:18.081
DOLLARS GO TO THAT POPULATION

00:55:18.148 --> 00:55:20.417

PREMIER PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM IN

THE NATION THIS TITLE SHOULD NOT

01:12:21.537 --> 01:12:25.407
HOW UNDERSTAFFED WE ARE AT UCLA.

01:12:25.474 --> 01:12:26.442

01:30:08.870 --> 01:30:10.738
WOULD BE A SIGNIFICANT RISK OF

01:30:10.805 --> 01:30:11.939
HAVING TO PAY THOUSANDS MORE.

01:30:12.006 --> 01:30:14.475

IS CONVERSION CHANT AND I'M A

01:30:20.681 --> 01:30:21.149
FIRST YEAR STUDENT AT THE

01:30:21.215 --> 01:30:21.916
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN

01:30:21.983 --> 01:30:24.152
DIEGO -- SO AS A FIRST

01:30:24.218 --> 01:30:25.586
GENERATION LOW INCOMESTUDENTS

01:30:25.653 --> 01:30:26.721
MOVING AWAY COLLEGE FOR THE

01:30:26.788 --> 01:30:28.689
FIRST TIME WAS A TRANSFORMATIVE

01:30:28.756 --> 01:30:30.691
GETS.

01:30:30.758 --> 01:30:32.293
SO AS YOU CAN IMAGINE WHEN I

01:30:32.360 --> 01:30:34.729
FOUND OUT THE HEADS ZERO UNITS

01:30:34.796 --> 01:30:36.697
ON THE FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL.

01:30:36.764 --> 01:30:39.967
I WAS TERRIFIED -- I I WAS

01:30:40.034 --> 01:30:40.434
THINKING ABOUT CALLING

01:30:40.501 --> 01:30:41.169
APPEARANCE I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO

01:30:41.235 --> 01:30:42.470
TELL THEM I DON'T THINK I'M EVEN

01:30:42.537 --> 01:30:44.005
A STUDENT NOW BECAUSE I'M NOT

01:30:44.071 --> 01:30:46.374
ENROLLED IN ANY CLASSES AT ALL --

01:30:46.440 --> 01:30:47.742

MY FINANCIALLY TO VOTE AND I

01:30:49.610 --> 01:30:53.314
DON'T KNOW IF I WAS GOING TO

MAKE IT TO COLLEGE I YOU KNOW IT.

01:30:54.382 --> 01:30:55.783
COULD IT COULD ATTEND ANYMORE --

01:30:55.850 --> 01:30:56.717
IT WAS FRUSTRATING BECAUSE THIS

01:30:56.784 --> 01:30:58.386
IS DUE TO OVER ENROLLMENT IN

01:30:58.452 --> 01:30:59.453
EXTREME WAIT LISTS -- STUFF I

01:30:59.520 --> 01:31:00.988
HAD NO CONTROL OVER -- SO MY

01:31:01.055 --> 01:31:02.790
GRADUATION DATE NOW COULD

01:31:02.857 --> 01:31:04.959
POSSIBLY BE PUSHED BACK BECAUSE

01:31:05.026 --> 01:31:06.394
OF CIRCUMSTANCES THAT.

01:31:06.460 --> 01:31:09.397
I DIDN'T HAVE ANY CONTROL -- SO

01:31:09.463 --> 01:31:10.665
THIS IS WHY I THINK THE SUMMER

01:31:10.731 --> 01:31:11.232
CAL GRANT FINANCIAL IT IS

01:31:11.299 --> 01:31:13.467

EXPONENTIALLY.

01:32:00.715 --> 01:32:02.817
