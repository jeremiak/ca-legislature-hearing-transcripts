ELIGIBLE TO BE HEARD AT OUR NEXT HEARING ALSO THE FOLLOWING BILLS ARE ON CONSENT AB EIGHT SEVEN EIGHT. SB SIX THREE AB THREE ONE FIVE A. B. SIX NINE TWO AND A. B. EIGHT ONE SEVEN- WE WOULD NORMALLY TRY TO ESTABLISH A QUORUM T THIS TIME WE HAVE. NOT ENOUGH MEMBERS- WE MAY BEGIN AS A SUB COMMITTEE. AND SO BEFORE WE DO THAT WE HAVE TO ADOPT BE A COMMITTEE RULES- SCISSORS THIS IS OUR FIRST BILL HEARING OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO LET'S SAY SAID SHE WANTED TO DROP COMMITTEE ROLES IS RECALLS A ROLL COUPLE WITH THE MAJORITY OF THE COMMITTEE IN FAVOR. ANYONE HAS ANY QUESTIONS PLEASE ASK THEM NOW IF NOT I WILL TAKE A MOTION- OR WE CAN'T BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE A QUORUM. BUT WE'RE GOING THROUGH THE FORMALITIES HERE OKAY- WE DO HAVE A BILL. AUTHOR HERE ND SO WHAT WE'LL ASK. HER TO COME. FORWARD AND PRESENT A BILL. YES THIS IS. THAT MEANS. OR GET. FOR MORE. GOOD AFTERNOON YEAH. THEY DR. THE AB WORKING GENERATE FUNDING. OKAY EDUCATION. WELL. MR DON'T. EIGHT DUCK IN UPLAND GAME BIRD STAMPS REQUIRED TO HUNT WATERFOWL AND UPLAND GAME BIRDS. SB SIX FOURTEEN ALSO REQUIRES GREATER ACCOUNTABILITY AND IMPROVE TRANSPARENCY OR THE SPENDING OF THE FUNDS COLLECTED VIA THE UPLAND GAME BIRD STAMP. IN LINE WITH CURRENT PRACTICES FOR THE STATE DUCK STAMP. LACK OF AVAILABLE NOW NESTING COVER ESPECIALLY IN AGRICULTURAL AREAS LIKE THE SACRAMENTO VALLEY RICE GROWING REGION. IS A SIGNIFICANT LIMITING FACTOR FOR BREEDING WATER FELL AND OTHER GROUND NESTING BIRDS. THE NESTING BIRD PROGRAM IS FLEXIBLE ENOUGH TO MEET CALIFORNIA GROWERS NEEDS AS FUNDS CAN BE USED TO PLANT COVER CROPS. ENHANCE EXISTING NESTING BIRD HABITAT OR ESTABLISHED NESTING COVER ON THE LANDS THAT ARE FOLLOWED UNDER DIFFERENT PROGRAMS. SB SIX FOURTEEN IS A RESOURCE GENERATING CONSERVATION MEASURES THAT WILL COMPLEMENT OUR STATEWIDE GOALS FOR CARBON SEQUESTRATION. IMPROVING AIR QUALITY THE PROTECTION OF OUR WATER FILL SPECIES. THE BILL HAS RECEIVED NO OPPOSITION ENJOYS WIDESPREAD SUPPORT FROM A DIVERSE COALITION OF SPORTSMEN'S GROUPS CONSERVATION ORGANIZATIONS AND PRIVATE LANDOWNERS AND AGRICULTURAL REPRESENTATIVES- WITH ME TO TESTIFY TODAY IN SUPPORT IS MARKEDLY WITH THE CALIFORNIA WATERFOWL ASSOCIATION AND LOUIS BROWN ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA RIGHTS COMMISSION. RIGHT BOB PLEASE YOUR FIRST WITNESS- PROCEED. CAN YOU HEAR ME THAT IS MARKEDLY WITH CALIFORNIA WATER PROBLEM. WE CAN HEAR YOU. RIGHT ALL RIGHT- IF YOU ARE AWARE AB SIX FOURTEEN IS VERY SIMILAR TO AB TWENTY ONE OH SIX BUT PASSED THE COMMITTEE LAST YEAR. CONNECTING BACK- BIRD HABITAT INCENTIVE PROGRAM IS AN EXISTING PROGRAM IN THE FIFTH FISHING GAME CODE BUT IT LACKED FUNDING. AB SIX WORKING WOULD PROVIDE A FIVE DOLLAR SURCHARGE ON BOTH STATE DOC IN UPLAND GAME BIRD STAMP. WHICH OUR MEMBERS MUST PURCHASE TO HUNT GAME BIRDS. HELP START UP THE PROGRAM. THERE'S A PRESSING NEED FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS PROGRAM. BLACKTIP SUFFICIENT VEGETATIVE COVER SIGNIFICANT LIMITING FACTOR FOR BREEDING WATERFOWL AND OTHER CRAP WHEN NESTING BIRDS AS IDENTIFIED IN BURKE HABITAT PLAN FINE BUT IT IT CALIFORNIA. STUDIES ALSO DEMONSTRATED THAT PROVIDING ADDITIONAL NOTHING COVERED THROUGH THE BREEDING USING- CAN GREATLY BENEFIT LOCAL WATERTOWN OTHER BIRDS. FOR EXAMPLE THE RESULTS OF A TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN RIGHTS- COVER CROP ROTATION PILOT PROJECT FOUND THAT ANNUAL COVER CROPS LOCATED YOU ADDICTED TO RICE CULTIVATION. PRODUCED ESPECIALLY HIGH AND NOT THINK ABOUT I WAS ABOUT 39% OUR LOCAL WATERFALL POPULATIONS HAVE DECLINED- 36% STATEWIDE SINCE NINETEEN NINETY TWO WHICH IS VERY DISHEARTENING- IT SHOULD ALSO BE NOTED THAT THERE WAS A PILE OF OVER SIXTY THOUSAND WATER TOPIC WOMEN'S REFUGES IN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY- IT YOU TO IT THAT THE OUTBREAK. MANY OF THE BIRDS AFFECTED ONE WATERFALL THAT READ IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY BUT USE THE KLAMATH REFUGES FOR MULTI PURPOSES WHICH PUTS FURTHER STRESS ON THEIR POPULATIONS- THE NESTING BIRD HABITAT THAT A PROGRAM IS DESIGNED TO BE FLEXIBLE FOR CALIFORNIA GROWERS- IT WOULD PERMIT FARMERS TO ROTATE THE FOLLOWING FIELDS EACH YEAR. WOULD ALSO INCENTIVIZE WHEAT FARMERS TO DELAY HARVEST THEIR CROP. GET NOTHING WATERTOWN OTHER BIRDS ENOUGHTIMES SUCCESSFULLY HATCHED BRAG. THE PROGRAM BUILDS ON- THE HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL NON REGULATORY APPROACH OF OTHER WATERFOWL BIRD CONSERVATION INITIATIVES THE PROBE PROVIDED FINANCIAL INCENTIVES AND WORK COOPERATIVELY WITH PRIVATE LANDOWNERS- IN ADDITION TO HELPING BIRDS AND OTHER WILDLIFE THE PROGRAM WHICH WESTER CARBON. IMPROVES SOIL HELP THEM PROVIDE AIR QUALITY THAT BENEFITS WHICH WAS MENTIONED FOR THESE REASONS WE RESPECT RESPECTFULLY ASK YOU TO SUPPORT THE BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU THE NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. MISTER CHAIRMAN FOR THE COMMITTEE LOUIS BROWN CALLING TODAY ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA RICE COMMISSION. HOW FOR ALL THE REASONS PREVIOUSLY STATED- IN REGARDS TO THE NESTING BIRD HABITAT PROGRAM AWARDS FOR THE BILL WELL SOME SUPPORT- FOR THE CHANGES THAT THE BILL PROVIDES FOR THE CALIFORNIA WINNER RIGHT HABITAT. INCENTIVE PROGRAM WHICH INCENTIVIZES GROWERS IN THE RIGHT INDUSTRY- TO FLOOD THEIR FIELDS IN WINTERTIME SO THAT- THIS IMPORTANT- THESE THESE IMPORTANT WETLANDS COULD BE MADE AVAILABLE FOR THE PACIFIC FLYWAY. THE LANGUAGE THAT WE WORKED INTO- THIS BILL HAS BEEN AGREED UPON WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND WILL REALLY PROVIDE SOME ADDITIONAL FLEXIBILITY- AND GREATER OPPORTUNITY TO INCREASE THE ACREAGE- THAT PARTICIPATE IN THIS PROGRAM NOW WITH IMPENDING DROUGHT- WE BELIEVE THAT THESE CHANGES ARE ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY. SO THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO PROVIDE THE NECESSARY HABITAT THAT WE'VE DONE- PROUDLY FOR- WELL OVER TWENTY YEARS SO WE ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU THANK THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'M GOING TO PAUSE BEFORE WE MOVE ON TO THE- NEXT SET OF.

THANK THANK YOU- GOOD AFTERNOON- MY NAME IS KIM DELFINO AND I'M REPRESENTING DEFENDERS OF WILDLIFE AND THE CALIFORNIA NATIVE PLANT SOCIETY- THESE ORGANIZATIONS ARE OPPOSING AB FIVE FIVE FOUR- NOT BECAUSE THEY OPPOSED THE CONCEPT OF CREATING- AND- BENJAMIN OFFICE OR CONDITIONS FOR RESOLVING DISPUTES- BUT BECAUSE THE CONCERNS WHAT SPECIFICALLY OVER- JUST BEAT UP A PERMITS- THE BILL CREATES AN OFFICE- THAT IS REPORTING ONLY TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE FISHING GAME COMMISSION- AND NOT WITH ANY WITH ANY- MINUS FORTY WITHIN THAT DEPARTMENT OFFICIALS WILDLIFE- THE- THE BILL- IN EXPLAINING AT THE BILL AT. ONE OF THE ISSUES WITH TALKING ABOUT RESOLVING ISSUES AROUND PERMITTING AND- SO THERE IS A QUESTION ABOUT IF THERE'S AN OFFICE CREATED- THAT'S REPORTABLE ONLY TO FISHING GAME COMMISSION PRESIDENT WHO ACTUALLY DOESN'T HAVE ANY- DIRECT RELATIONSHIP WITH THE ACTUAL PERMITTING REQUIREMENTS ARE JURISDICTION IT'S A QUESTION OF WHETHER THERE'S ANY A PROCESS THAT WOULD WOULD BE SET UP IN A WAY THAT COULD BE. COULD RESOLVE THOSE TYPES OF ISSUES THE OTHER PROBLEM IS THAT- BY SETTING UP THE OFFICE IT CREATES- EXAMS ALL DISCUSSION- FROM THE PUBLIC RECORDS ACT AND KEEP EVERYTHING CONFIDENTIAL- WHICH MAKES SENSE WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE THAT ARE REPORTING- EDUCATE VIOLATIONS WITHIN A NURSING HOME AND YOU'RE TRYING TO PROTECT THOSE PEOPLE FROM- RETALIATION HERE- IF YOU'RE SAYING- IT'S- THERE'S A REDUCED YOU OVER A PERMIT. THERE'S THAT MINISTRY TO RECORD THAT IS CREATED AROUND THAT PERMIT BY CREATING A SEPARATE SIDE THE PROCESS IT EXEMPTS- THAT ABILITY OF THE PUBLIC AND FOLKS YOU KNOW LIKE WHAT KINDS OF BACK AND FORTH ARE GOING ON OVER THE ADMINISTRATION OF THEIR NATURAL RESOURCES. LAWS- SO. YOU KNOW FOR THE REASONS WE DO THINK THE BILL AS CURRENTLY DESIGNED. MAKES SENSE NOT WELL ARE CERTAINLY ISSUES WITH THAT OF IN TERMS OF- AROUND PERMITTING WE ACTUALLY THINK A BETTER. WAY OF RESOLVING SOME THE PERMITTING ISSUES MIGHT BE A WITH PROVIDING BETTER SUPPORT FOR THE DEPARTMENT SO THAT THEY CAN ACTUALLY ADMINISTER THEIR LIVES AND I'LL LET I BELIEVE THERE'S ANOTHER. WITNESS WHOSE- IN OPPOSITION CAN SPEAK TO THAT ISSUE MARKET THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU NEXT PERSON ON THE TELEPHONE. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRS CAN YOU HEAR ME WE CAN HEAR YOU.

ON COMMERCIAL POACHING AND PARTICULARLY ABALONE POACHING BECAUSE OUR RESOURCES PARTICULAR APOLLONIA SO FRAGILE THAT IT WAS NOT STOP THERE WON'T BE ANY OUT BONUS SO SIMPLE. THE LEGISLATURE RESPONDED WITHOUT THE ONLY PROVISIONS BUT THEY DID GIVE US HIGH POINTS SO WE HAVE REALLY HIGH POINT ASSOCIATED WITH THESE CRIMES AND THEY NEED TIME TO PAY THEM OFF AND THAT'S THE PURPOSE OF AN EXTENDED PROBATIONARY PERIOD. TO GET ALLOW THEM TO PAY OFF OF FOR INSTANCE POACHING OF A COMMERCIAL POACHING OF ABALONE IS A FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLAR MINIMUM POINT WHICH WITH FAMILY ASSESSMENTS TRANSLATION. TO FORTY TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS. THEY NEED TIME TO PAY THE FINE OFF. AND THAT'S WHY WE NEEDED EXTENT ALL ALSO WE WANT TO IMPOSE BE ABLE TO IMPOSE. DO NOT HUNT DO NOT FISH THOSE KIND OF PENALTIES ASSOCIATED WITH HIS AGREE JUST TYPE VIOLATIONS. SO WE WOULD ASK THAT YOU. SUPPORT THIS MEASURE AND PASS IT PLEASE THANK YOU THANK YOU YOUR NEXT WITNESS. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS RUGGER FOR SPEAKING ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA RIFLE AND PISTOL ASSOCIATION BUT MORE SO TODAY SPEAKING AS RETARGETING MORTON THIRTY TWO YEARS. I'M HERE TO TESTIFY TODAY FOR. THE VICTIMS OF THESE CRIMES I CAN'T TESTIFY FOR OURSELVES. NOT I'VE BEEN IN THIS BUILDING MANY TIMES TO WATCH A LOT OF TESTIMONY OF VICTIMS OF CRIMES TESTIFYING IT'S ALWAYS VERY MOVING. FOR THE WILDLIFE AND DID RESOURCE THAT WE'RE HERE TO PROTECT DAY CAN'T TESTIFY FOR THEMSELVES. I'M ALSO HERE TO REPRESENT GAME WARDENS IT BECAUSE OUR STATE EMPLOYEES THEY CAN'T STAND FROM THIS MIKE EITHER AND- SINCE I RETIRED I'VE A FREE SOUL NOW AND I CAN SAY WHAT I BELIEVE. THIS BILL THAT ASTRONOMER GALLAGHER IS DOING IS CRITICAL I ANNOT TELL YOU HOW HARD IT IS TO MAKE SOME OF THESE CASES. MY COLLEAGUES SPEAK ALREADY ON BEHALF OF PROSECUTORS IN WHAT IT MEANS FOR THEM TO HAVE THESE THESE TOOLS IN THEIR TOOL BELT. BUT FOR GAME MORE TO SPEND COUNTLESS HOURS SOMETIMES YEARS IN THE FIELD TO MAKE THESE CASES WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE MOST GRIEVOUS VIOLATORS WHO PUT A PRICE TAG ON OUR WILDLIFE AND OUR RESOURCES HEAD. TO MAKE MONEY OFF OF IT. AND NOT JUST AGAIN THAT PERSON JUST SHOOTS A FEW HOURS BEFORE SHE TIME A FEW MINUTES AFTER SHE TIME. THESE FOLKS SET OUT EVERY DAY TO RIP OFF OUR RESOURCES EVERYBODY IN THIS ROOM EVERYBODY THE STATE. IS A VICTIM OF THESE CRIMES. AND IT MEANS SO MUCH OF THE GAME WORKS A BILL TO PUT THESE PEOPLE OUT OF THE FIELD IT'S CRITICAL FOR WILDLIFE TO GET HIM OUT OF FUEL. AND THESE POACHERS DON'T LIMIT THEIR ACTIVITIES TO JUST TO CALIFORNIA. THESE FOLKS POACH ALL OVER THE WESTERN UNITED STATES IF NOT NORTH AMERICA. THAT'S WHY THE PROBATION TERMS THAT WERE SEEKING TO RETAIN THIS BILL THE THREE YEARS IS CRITICAL TO GET THESE FOLKS WHAT'S CALLED A WHILE LEADERS VIOLATOR OF. INTERNATIONAL WHILE LEADERS OF VIOLATORS COMPACT IT TAKES ALMOST A YEAR TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN AND WITH THE CURRENT TERMS OF JUST A YEAR PROBATION. WE DON'T HAVE A CHANCE TO GET MEN CONTACT NOW WE PUT A LOT OF BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA. BUT THROUGHOUT THE NATION. SO I CAN'T TELL YOU ENOUGH HOW MUCH I BELIEVE- MY PASSION FOR THIS MEASURE SHINES THROUGH. IT'S CRITICAL THAT WE JUST WE'RE NOT ASKING FOR MORE JUST ASKING TO PROTECT WAS ALREADY THERE TO GET. US TO LET THE GAME MORE TO CAL. ANYA TO REST LIVES EVERY DAY. TO PROTECT YOUR- TO DO THEIR JOB. AND PUT FOLKS OUT OF BUSINESS SO PLEASE WITH ALL THE- I ASK FOR YOUR I. THANK YOU SIR.

IF YOU'RE IN OPPOSITION OF THE BILL PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO AGAIN ONE ZERO FOR OPPOSITION. THIS TIME THERE ARE NONE IN THE QUEUE PLEASE CONTINUE MR WILL BRING YOU BACK TO THE BODY HERE TO QUESTIONS. EXCELLENT. THANKS VERY MUCH THANKS MISTER CHAIRMAN AND THANKS- CINEMATOGRAPHER FOR INTRODUCING THIS I'M I'M KIND OF. HAVING A BIT OF A DISCONNECT RELATED TO THE SHORT SHORTENING OF PROBATIONARY PERIODS IN GENERAL IN CALIFORNIA AND THE BE- ANALYSIS DOES TALK ABOUT THE RECENT PASSAGE OF AB NINETEEN FIFTY. I DON'T RECALL HOW YOU VOTED BY IMAGINING VOTED AGAINST IT- YOU CORRECT IF I'M WRONG I BET PERHAPS SOME OF THE DA'S OF THE WARDENS WOULD HAVE BEEN AGAINST IT AS WELL- SO I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S FAIR. TO ASK THEM ABOUT ABOUT THAT DISCONNECT BUT I WOULD BE GLAD TO HEAR. YOUR WITNESSES WAY N. ON. BEAT BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T REALLY SEEN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ONE YEAR PROBATIONARY PERIOD WHEN HAVE THEY GIVEN. PROBATIONARY PERIODS OF DIFFERENT DURATION. AND THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ONE OF THOSE PERIODS WHEN HAVE THEY SAID WELL THIS IS A ONE YEAR PROBATIONARY PERIOD I SEE IN IT AN EXAMPLE IN THE ANALYSIS OF THE THREE YEAR AND A BIG FINE THAT HAPPENED- IN ELDORADO- COUNTY. IF SO COULD YOU CALL WALK ME THROUGH HOW THEY PURSUE THE DIFFERENT LENGTHS OF PROBATIONARY PERIOD AND WHAT THE RECIDIVISM IS FOR THAT FOR US TO CONSIDER WALKING BACK A VERY SIGNIFICANT REFORM JUST PASSED. A FEW MONTHS AGO. YOU KNOW ALL THAT- PERHAPS- LARRY WOULD BE ABLE TO SPEAK TO THAT AS A FORMER DA- AS YOU KNOW NINETEEN FIFTY WAS A VERY BROAD ACROSS THE BOARD I DON'T EVEN THINK IT WAS REALLY THE INTENT TO DO THIS FOR THESE TYPES OF CRIMES AND SO WE'RE JUST TRYING TO SAY HEY FOR THESE CRIMES LET'S TAKE THAT BACK TO THE THREE YEAR PROBATION. AND REALLY WHAT PROBATION DOES IT TAKES WHETHER HUNTING THEY WILL NOW NO LONGER BE ABLE TO HUNT FOR THOSE THREE YEARS NO MATTER HIS LIVELIHOOD PERHAPS WE GOT YOU KNOW PEOPLE THAT ARE DOING THIS OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND MAYBE ONLY. YOU KNOW. LOSING LOSING THEIR LICENSE FOR ONE YEAR MINIMAL PENALTIES. THAT DOESN'T REALLY DETER PEOPLE FROM DOING THIS AGAIN. APPS CAN AND I THINK FOR THE FORMER DA I'D LOVE TO HEAR THAT THAT COMMENTARY BUT ALSO IF THEY'RE WILLING TO POACH WELL WHY NOT DO IT WITHOUT THE LICENSE ANYHOW SO TO JUST DESCRIBE YOU KNOW WHAT IS WHAT IS THAT CRIMINAL ELEMENT THINKING ABOUT. DOING THIS. WELL MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU. WELL THE OF. AS I UNDERSTAND IT THE LEGISLATION THAT SHORT THE PROBATIONARY PERIOD DID CARVE OUT EXCEPTIONS. ONE OF THOSE EXCEPTIONS WAS FOR DO YOU WHY. DO YOU WHY DID DRIVING UNDER THE INFLUENCE OBVIOUSLY HAS A LONGER PROBATIONARY PERIOD BECAUSE- AGAIN IT'S A HIGH FIND A NEEDS TO BE PAID OFF. BUT IT ALSO GIVES THE ABILITY TO. FILE A PROBATION YOUR ANSWERS SOME SORT OF VIOLATION THE FUTURE DRIVING WITHOUT A LICENSE EVEN. OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT THAT WOULD VIOLATE THE TERMS OF A PROBATION. MISDEMEANOR PROBATION IS REALLY NOT A BIG DEAL. IT'S A PROBATION TO THE COURT ONLY THEY'RE NOT RESPOND OR NOT- GOING BACK TO PROBATION OFFICER. IT'S ONLY TO A COURT. AND IT IS LIKE OF SOMETHING COMES UP AND- THEY WANT TO COME BACK AND GET IT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE. IS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WHAT I WOULD MUCH RATHER HAVE FELONY PROVISIONS. FOR COMMERCIAL POACHING- BUT AS LONG AS WE'RE GOING TO HAVE. THE YOU KNOW THE HIGH FINES AND- AND BROOKE PROHIBITIONS WE NEED SOME WAY TO ENFORCE IT. AND PROBATION IS THE EASIEST WAY TO ENFORCE IT. BECAUSE OF PROBATION VIOLATION IS A HEARING BEFORE A JUDGE WITH A LOWER STANDARD OF PROOF IT DOESN'T REQUIRE A JURY TRIAL. AND BRING ALL THE PEOPLE AND TO PROVE UP OF. A PROBATION VIOLATION SO IT'S A LOT EASIER PROVEA PROBATION VIOLATION OR DISPROVE UP. US A SEPARATE OFFENSE. AND YOU KNOW AGAIN THEY NEED THE TIME TO PAY OFF THE FINE SO WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A HIGH FINES WE NEED TO HAVE TIME TO PAY MORE. SO IT TOOK YOU CAN. APPROACH THE POINT ABOUT WHEN YOU HAVE SOUGHT ONE YEAR OR TWO YEAR OR THREE YEARS AND HOW THAT DOES IN FACT. AFFECT BEHAVIOR OF THE POACHER. AND WHETHER DURATION THAT YOU'VE AND I'M JUST TRUSTING YOU TO GIVE ME GOOD GOOD DATA GOOD STORY ABOUT THIS BUT DOES NOT REALLY IMPACT A CHANGE IN BEHAVIOR. OR IS THAT JUST A PUNITIVE MEASURE- YOU KNOW WE DON'T HAVE AN OF GAME AWARDS IN THE STATE IS IT IS WE HAVE VERY FEW GAME AWARDS BUT WHEN. YOU HAVE SOMEBODY CONVICTED OF AN OFFENSE LIKE THIS THEY WATCH THEM. THEY PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT THEY'RE DOING AND THEY DO COME BACK AND THAT DOES HAVE AN IMPACT ON WHAT HAPPENS IN THE FUTURE MMHM VERY MUCH SO. AND AS A ROY POINTED OUT THEY GET IN THE CONTACT TO GO TO ANOTHER STATE TO TRY TO HALT EVEN. TO GET PICKED UP A VIDEO YES THEY DO CONTACT IS IT IS A NET NATIONWIDE- SYSTEM THAT TARGETS POACHERS. AND THEY CAN PICK WE CAN PICK THEM UP HERE AND WE HAVE. WE HAVE A PROSECUTOR FROM OUT OF STATE. MANY TIMES YEAH AND I THINK THIS FOR ME TO BE HELPFUL IN LEARNING ABOUT THIS THIS PROBATION IS A VERY DIFFERENT PUNITIVE MEASURE. THAN WHAT WE ARE TYPICALLY THINKING ABOUT WHEN WE THINK ABOUT PROBATION FOR OTHER- MISDEMEANORS THAT THAT PEOPLE ARE CONVICTED OF. I THINK THAT'S TRUE YEAH. I THINK I WOULD AGREE WITH THAT. AND ONLY BECAUSE WHEN YOU'RE AT THE LEVEL OF A COMMODE COMMERCIAL POACHER. THEN EVERYBODY'S WATCHING. ALL THE AT THE GAME AWARDS ALL KNOW WHO THIS PERSON CHEMOURS ARE VERY CLOSE KNIT GROUP OF LAW ENFORCEMENT WITHIN THE STATE. AND THEY KNOW WHO THESE FOLKS ARE. IN THE FALL IN FACT WHEN I WAS A CIRCUIT PROSECUTOR. I GET A BEAR POACHING. OF CASE IN SISKIYOU COUNTY AND I GO DOWN TO SEE YOUR CANDIDATE THE- BEAR HUNTERS THERE ALREADY KNEW WHO I WAS. ARE YOU MY NAME THEY KNEW WHAT I DID AND IF YOU COULD JUST ADDRESS HOW YOU WOULD DETERMINE THE DURATION OF PROBATION. OF GENERAL IS NEGOTIATED. IT'S NO GOOD SHOULD GO SHE'D WITH THE DEFENDERS ATTORNEY. I HAD ONE CASE WHERE A GUY WAS. LURING BEARS OUT OF LASSEN PARK. BUT A GUIDE. AND HE WOULD TAKE HIS HIS HIS CLIENT UP THERE. AND HE HAD A BIG A BIG PILOTS LESSONS THE ONLY BELIEVE HAVE A GUN LAST PARK WILL HUNT. SO HE WAS WILLING THE BEARS OUTSIDE LASSEN PARK. AND HIS CLIENTS WOULD PAY MONEY TO GO UP AND BEAR THEY ALWAYS GOT A FAIR BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO BE AROUND THE STATE. AND IF YOU HAVE WITH A TEN THOUSAND DOLLAR FINE. FIVE YEARS NO HUNTING. AND BASICALLY SHOWS GUIDING BUSINESS DOWN- BUT AGAIN THAT WAS A- AND THE WAY HE GOT VIOLATED BECAUSE YOU. ONE HUNDRED IN A DIFFERENT STATE AND CAUGHT UP WITH. SO IT DOES WORK I THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS IF I COULD JUST HAVE ONE MINUTE TO ADDRESS SYSTEMS QUESTION ABOUT THE MINDSET OF THE POACHER YES PLEASE GO ONE RESPECT YOU ASK WHY NOT WHAT IS THE POSTER JUST GO HUNT WITHOUT A LICENSE. AND THEY DO BUT THE BEAUTY OF THAT THE REASON THE GAME WARDENS NEED THIS PROBATION IS IT TAKES SO MUCH TO LINE UP ALL THOSE PLANETS TO CATCH VIOLATORS. VIOLATING WHEREAS WITH THE PROBATION TERMS OF NO HONEY YOU KNOW IF THEY CHOOSE TO HOME WITHOUT A LICENSE THEN THE GAME MORE HAS THAT INDIVIDUAL HIM OR HER DURING THE FIELD FOR JUST BEING THERE WITH IMPLEMENTS A TAKE. AND THEN THE ALREADY GAUTAM AS OPPOSED TO IF THEY COULD LEGALLY HAVE THAT LICENSE IN HERE THEN CAME WORDS BACK TO SQUARE ONE HAVE TO LINE ALL THOSE PLANETS UP AGAIN TO CATCH. THAT INDIVIDUAL DOES THAT HELP SIR. YEAH I KNOW IT IT DOES HELP I HAVE NO PLACE IN MY HEART FOR POACHERS A HORSE IS LOOKING AT. YOU KNOW FOR TRYING TO- ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO REHABILITATE AND- YOU KNOW BE A CONTRIBUTING MEMBER OF SOCIETY AND- A WHOLE OTHER AREA- CRIMINAL JUSTICE. THAT I WANT TO REALLY UNDERSTAND. HOW THIS IS IMPACTING THE SPACES WELL- AND IT YOU KNOW IT'S A IT'S A- BIT THE POLICY IMPLICATIONS ARE ARE SIMILAR. FOR THE INDIVIDUAL THAT WE'RE TRYING TO. REHABILITATE AND- AND STOP. DOING THESE CRIMES- SO IT'S WORTHY OF THE CONVERSATION. I MEAN IT'S WE CAN ALL BE VERY OFFENDED BY THE BEHAVIOR- BUT WE'RE WE'VE BEEN PUSHING THE STATE. IN IN ONE DIRECTION FOR REASON I REALLY WANTED TO- AND YOU BOTH HAVE AND I THINK THE AUTHOR. HAS DONE A REALLY GOOD JOB OF EXPLAINING. THE DIFFERENCE AND THE DISTINCTION IN THIS SITUATION AND WITH THIS TYPE OF PROBATION. FROM WHAT WE WERE PERHAPS GOING AFTER WITH AB NINETEEN FIFTY THANK YOU.

PRODUCTION AND UNFORTUNATE SEEMS INEVITABLE AT THIS POINT AND SO WITHOUT A PLAN OR A STRATEGIC APPROACH TO ADDRESS- SIGMA IMPACTED LAND CONVERSIONS LAND WILL NO LONGER BE FARMED AND WILL LAY- YOU KNOW- YOU KNOW WITH- WITHOUT A PRIMARY USE. AND SO- YOU KNOW SO THIS IS CERTAINLY GONNA BECOME AN ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITY- AND WILL EVENTUALLY NEED A REMEDY- AND SO YOU KNOW THIS LEGISLATION HERE ASSEMBLY BILL TWO FIVE TWO- WILL INSTEAD IS SURE THAT WE'RE APPROACHING THIS ISSUE MORE STRATEGICALLY. BY WORKING TO REPURPOSE IDLED OR FALLOW LAND IN WAYS THAT BENEFIT OUR ECONOMY. AND OUR AND ARE- ENVIRONMENT LOCALLY REGIONALLY AND SPECIFICALLY THIS BILL IT PROPOSES TO CREATE A PILOT PROGRAM THAT WOULD- PROVIDE SOME GRANTS TO LOCAL GROUNDWATER SUSTAINABILITY AGENCIES TO COUNTIES AND TO AND TO- OTHERS TO PRO ACTIVELY CONVERT LANDON TOLD ME WILDLIFE HABITAT GROUNDWATER RECHARGE. RANGELAND OR OTHER USES- AND SO THIS BILL ENJOYS BROAD SUPPORT FROM ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS FROM- FROM- FROM BUSINESS FROM WATER AGENCIES AND MANY MANY OTHERS- IT'S A WITH THAT INVITE OUR COLLEAGUES FROM. SUCH A VALLEY PHYSICAL. THANK YOU THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS AB DOES YOUR CALL PRESENTS WITH SOMEONE MEMBER RIVAS ON ASSEMBLY BILL TWO FIFTY TWO AS YOU GUYS KNOW AND WE'VE HEARD IN THIS COMMITTEE IN PREVIOUS YEARS CIGNA IS GONNA HAVE A HUGE IMPACT NOT ONLY ON THE CENTRAL VALLEY BUT A LOT OF DIFFERENT PARTS OF CALIFORNIA- WITH CRAFTING THIS BILL WOULD WE WOULD SPEND A COUPLE OF YEARS IN THE MAKING. BUT WE BELIEVE THIS IS A GOOD WIN WIN THIS IS A WIN FOR THE ENVIRONMENTALISTS THIS IS A WIN FOR THE- FARMERS AND FOR AGRICULTURE WHAT THEY'RE GONNA DO IS WE'RE GONNA HAVE THIS PILOT PROGRAM THAT WE CAN USE HAVE SOME BENEFICIAL USES THINGS LIKE CREATING PARKS OUR COMMUNITY RECREATION CENTERS- DRYLAND FARMING RESTORING FLOOD PLAINS AND HABITATS CREATING RAGE LAND. AND SOME OF THE PROJECTS THAT I'VE SEEN IS A WILDLIFE CONSERVATION SO WE SEE THIS AS A WIN WIN- MOVING FORWARD IN THIS IS ANTICIPATION OF THE BIG AFFECT THAT SO IT WAS GOING TO HAVE AN RESPECTFULLY ASK. FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU. C. HAVE BUT- TO WHAT ARE ONE AND HATED DIRECTOR OF WESTERN WATER RESILIENT ESCAPE ON THE TELEPHONE LINE TO LASKER TO PROCEED. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ON EIGHTY TWO FIFTY TWO I AM MANHATTAN WITH ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE FUND THE SPONSOR OF THE CELL. WE'RE HERE TODAY BECAUSE CENTER VALLEY HAS REACHED A FORK IN THE ROAD ON ONE PASS WITHOUT MEASURES LIKE AB TWO FIFTY TO THE VALLEY COULD BECOME A HAPHAZARD PATCHWORK OF DUSTY FIELD WITH INVASIVE WEEDS IN PASSED. FURTHER IMPAIRING ALREADY POOR AIR QUALITY AND PUTTING MANY FARM WORKERS OUT OF WORK ON ANOTHER PATH THE VALLEY COULD TRANSFORM INTO A WATER RESILIENT AGRICULTURAL REGION RIDING AMID A MOSAIC OF VIBRANT NEW LAND USES. LIKE HABITAT CORRIDORS WILDLIFE FRIENDLY RECHARGE AREAS OR OUTDOOR. RECREATIONAL SPACES FOR FAMILIES. THIS BILL CAN HELP MOVE THE DOWN THIS PASS. THE CANNIBAL GRAMMAR MANAGEMENT ACT OR SIGMA WHEN ACTED IN TWENTY FOURTEEN TO ADDRESS CRITICAL GROUNDWATER OVERDRAFT WHICH CAUSED PLAN THINK DAMAGED INFRASTRUCTURE AND DRIED UP COMMUNITY DRINKING WELL DURING THE LAST DROUGHT. SIGMA IS CRUCIAL TO BUILDING LONG TERM WATER SUSTAINABILITY. ONE UNFORTUNATE REALITY OF THIS TRANSITION IS THAT A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF AGRICULTURAL LAND ASSEMBLY DECIDE TO GIVE SOMEBODY. WILL NEED TO BE TAKEN OUT OF PRODUCTION OVER THE NEXT COUPLE DECADES. THIS WILL BE A CHALLENGE EXACERBATED BY MORE FREQUENT DROUGHTS LIKE WHAT WE'RE EXPERIENCING NOW. AB TWO FIFTY TO TURN THIS CHALLENGE INTO A NEW OPPORTUNITY FOR FARMERS AND COMMUNITIES. FIVE SEVENTEEN THE MULTI BENEFIT LANDRY PURPOSING INCENTIVE PROGRAM THIS BILL WILL ENABLE FARMERS TO RECEIVE PAYMENTS FOR VOLUNTARILY REPURPOSE SAYING SOME OF THEIR LAND TO PRODUCE ECOSYSTEM. RECREATIONAL AND OTHER BENEFITS THAT THE VALLEY AND ITS COMMUNITIES NEED AND WANT. AB TWO FIFTY TWO IS THE MOST PROMISING WAY TO TAKE THE CENTRAL VALLEY DOWN A NEW PATH TOWARD A MORE RESILIENT FUTURE FOR PEOPLE AND WILDLIFE. WE'D LIKE TO THANK ASSEMBLYMEMBERS RIVAS AND SALAS FOR THEIR PARTNERSHIP ON THIS BILL AND RESPECTFULLY URGE AN IPHONE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. WHEN ASKED IF THERE'S ANYONE IN THE ROOM.

OR IS THIS IS THE READING OF THE NEEDLE IN TERMS OF ISSUES THAT ARE QUITE- QUITE DIFFICULT TO HANDLE SIGMA AS THEIR MUCH ANTICIPATED- POLICY THAT WILL BE GETTING ROLLED OUT SOON AND WE'LL SEE WHAT. THE IMPLICATIONS OF ALL THOSE PLANS OR SOME IT WILL BE SOON AND I KNOW THAT OUR FARMING COMMUNITY WAS OF VERY VERY INTERESTED IN BEING ENGAGED AND PREVIEW BRINGS FOR I'D LIKE TO ADD ON AS- SO WHAT DO WITH YOUR- PERMISSION TO BOTH OF YOU AND- NOW WE DO HAVE A MOTION THE SECOND DOES HAVE A DO PASS RECOMMENDATION SAUCE FOR ROCA. THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS EDUARDO GARCIA. EDUARDO GARCIA HI DOLLY. DOLLY I BENNETT. BENNETT I BIGELOW. BIGELOW I FRIEDMAN FRIEDMAN HI CRISTINA GARCIA KALRA LEVIN LEVINE AYE MERE SU CHI NORMAN NEWMAN AYE RUBIO RUBIO AYE SALAS SALAS I SMITH. SMITH I'D BE ABLE TO DO IT THE OPRAH DO OUTSIDE WARD WARD I. THE STRUCTURE AND ALSO LIKE TO ADD ON AS A CO AUTHOR OF FICTION THANK YOU THAT. CITING YES. FOR THE CONSIDERATION AND ENGAGEMENT ON- THIS BILL. AND THE FOLLOWING MY APPOINTMENT TO SERVE AS CHAIR OF- THE ASSEMBLY- THE COMMITTEE ON AGRICULTURE THIS PAST SEPTEMBER. I EMBARKED ON A TWO MONTH STATEWIDE AGRICULTURE TOUR OF MEETINGS AND SITE VISITS AND MY GOAL WAS TO ENGAGE WITH STAKEHOLDERS ACROSS OUR STATE- AND GATHER PERSPECTIVES ON THE NEEDS OF- OF CALIFORNIA'S DIVERSE AND PRODUCTIVE AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY. YOU KNOW IT'S OVER TWO MONTHS I MET WITH APPROXIMATELY SEVENTY STAKEHOLDERS. I VISITED OVER FIFTY SITES- I WOULD HAVE DONE MORE BUT OBVIOUSLY IS DURING THE SURGE OF. OF US PANDEMIC IN SO WE HAD TO RESCHEDULE A LOT OF THESE VISITS. BUT ALL OF OUR VISITS INCLUDED FARMERS- FARMING AGRICULTURAL WORKERS- INDUSTRY UNION LEADERS ENVIRONMENTALISTS SCIENTISTS AND RESEARCHERS FROM UC DAVIS AND UCLA. A COUPLE WEEKS AGO ON NATIONAL AG DAY MY OFFICE RELEASED A REPORT OUT FROM OUR AG TOUR THE- YOU KNOW IN IN THIS REPORT- IT WAS SENT TO ALL OF. YOUR OFFICES. THIS REPORT INCLUDES FINDINGS AND POLICY IDEAS BASED ON THE CONVERSATIONS IN THE LEVEL OF ENGAGEMENT WE HAD. AND SO THIS LEGISLATION- HERE ASSEMBLY BILL THREE OH THREE- MARICULTURE PILOT PROGRAM. IT WAS INSPIRED BY A VISIT I HAD A MEETING I HAD I DIDN'T AQUACULTURE OPERATION AT THE PORT OF SAN DIEGO. AND IT WAS AT THAT VISIT WERE I LEARNED OF NEW RESEARCH IN INCREASING BODY OF RESEARCH. SHOWING THAT SHELLFISH AND SEAWEED FARMS OR OPERATIONS IF DONE RIGHT. IF THE RIGHT PRACTICES ARE DEPLOYED IN THE RIGHT PLACES. THEY CAN ACTUALLY DELIVER RESTORATIVE US AND BENEFITS FOR OCEAN HEALTH. IT CAN BE A VERY EFFECTIVE TOOL TO FIGHT CLIMATE CHANGE. AND IS ONE OF THE MOST SUSTAINABLE FORMS OF FOOD PRODUCTION ON OUR PLANET SO UNFORTUNATELY AS I LEARNED THE BIGGEST CONSTRAINT TO EXPANDING MARICULTURE HERE AND OUR STATE IS CURRENTLY AND HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE PERMITTING PROCESS. THE PERMITTING PROCESS IN OUR STATE IS EXHAUSTIVE IT IS TIME CONSUMING. AND IT IS PROHIBITIVELY EXPENSIVE. IN FACT HERE CALIFORNIA IS EXPONENTIALLY EASIER. TO OBTAIN APPROVAL FOR A NEW OIL WELL. THEN IT IS THE FARM SHELLFISH OR SEA WEED. CALLAGY AND WILL- WILL TYPICALLY APPROVING OIL OUT WITHIN TEN DAYS. WITH USUALLY NO- NO NOTICE THE PUBLIC. NOT A PERIOD TO MAKE COMMENTS OR PROJECT SPECIFIC ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW. NOW THE ABSOLUTE MOST OPTIMISTIC SCENARIO FOR MARICULTURE. IS THREE TO FOUR YEARS PER PROJECT. BUT MORE REALISTICALLY IT COULD TAKE OVER A DECADE. THAT'S ALL YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THE DATA IN THE PAST TEN YEARS ABOUT TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND NEW OIL WELLS HAD BEGUN OPERATION IN CALIFORNIA. IN THAT SAME TIME FRAME EXACTLY ZERO. ZERO NEW SHELLFISH OR SEE WE FARMS HAD BEGUN OPERATION. AND SO THAT IS WHY THIS LEGISLATION PROPOSES TO CREATE A PILOT PROGRAM. DETEST AN ALTERNATIVE MORE STRAIGHT FORWARD APPROACH THE CALIFORNIA'S MARICULTURE PERMITTING. AND IT WOULD DO SO WITHOUT SACRIFICING THE HIGH INBOUND ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS THE INDUSTRY CURRENTLY ACHIEVES. THIS LEGISLATION REQUIRES THAT CALIFORNIA'S LEADING REGULATORY AGENCIES FOR. OCEAN FARMING FOR MARICULTURE. TO COLLABORATIVELY WORK TOGETHER IN ADOPTED THE REGULATIONS FOR THIS PROPOSED PILOT PROGRAM. PROVIDING THEM WITH THE DISCRETION TO IDENTIFY THE RIGHT MANAGEMENT PRACTICES TO BE DEPLOYED. TO IDENTIFY ALLOWED SPECIES FOR BOTH RESTORATION AND COMMERCIAL PRODUCTION. AT TO DESIGNATE THE RIGHT PLACES OR PHYSICAL LOCATIONS FOR POTENTIAL OPERATIONS. THE RESULT I HOPE IS THAT THERE WILL BE AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF NUMERICAL TRIP PROJECTS HERE IN OUR STATE WHICH I I'VE WHICH WHICH WHICH I'VE SAID WOULD YIELD SIGNIFICANT BENEFITS TO OUR STATE IN TERMS OF FOOD PRODUCTION. ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND THE BENEFITS TO OUR ENVIRONMENT NOT TO MENTION AS I LEARNED IN AS- A STUDY- THAT WAS JUST RELEASED ABOUT A MONTH AGO- CONFIRMED. THAT THIS RED SEA WEED WHEN INCORPORATED INTO THE FEET OF CATTLE. WE SHOWN TO REDUCE METHANE. EMISSIONS FROM CATTLE BURPS AND. AND OTHER THINGS BY OVER 80% OVER 80% BY ADDING JUST A SMALL AMOUNT OF SEA WEED TO THEIR FEET. AND SO WITH ME HERE TO- PROVIDE SOME TESTIMONY IS TERRY SAWYER CO FOUNDER OF HOG ISLAND OYSTER COMPANY. AND DR- HOLLY FOR A LOOK ON BEHALF OF THE NATURE. OF THE NATURE CONSERVANCY THANK YOU MEASURE. THANK YOU. AND I BELIEVE THEY'RE BOTH CLOUT COLLEEN INSULT PEOPLE STATE. EIGHT TO PROVIDE THE TESTIMONY TUESDAY IN SUPPORT FOR THE AB THREE OH THREE. IT'S BEEN AN HONOR TO BUILD OUR BUSINESS AND PROVIDE GOOD HEALTHY LOCAL FOOD TO OUR COMMUNITY WHILE BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE JOB OPPORTUNITIES FOR OVER THREE HUNDRED PEOPLE. PRE PANDEMIC. WE'VE SEEN THAT WE CAN GROW OYSTERS IN A WAY THAT IS COMPATIBLE WITH AND EVEN HELPS ADVANCE THE CONSERVATION OF OUR VEHICLE DEMOLISHED BAY AND WE'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR ALMOST FORTY YEARS. BUT THERE'S BEEN MANY CHALLENGES THE CURRENT PERMITTING THE LEASING THE REGULATORY SYSTEM IS SIMPLY NOT DESIGNED FOR PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO DO BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA IT IS NOT SUSTAINABLE. WE'RE WILLING AND EAGER TO MEET THE HIGHEST ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS IN THE NATION. WE ABSOLUTELY DEPEND ON COLD WATER TO SURVIVE COLD CLEAN WATER TO SURVIVE. BUT A POOR MEETING THOSE STANDARDS WE WANT TO BE TREATED JUST LIKE ANY OTHER BUSINESS WE CAN'T KEEP JUMPING THROUGH NEW AND DIFFERENT HOOPS ALL THE TIME. THERE'S SO MUCH INTEREST IN SUSTAINABLE AMERICOLD SURE AMONG THE NEXT GENERATION. BUT AT THE RATE WE'RE GOING I'M WORRIED THAT NONE OF THEM WILL BE ABLE TO GET INTO THIS FIELD. THAT'S WHY WE'RE SO SUPPORTIVE OF THIS PROPOSED PILOT PROGRAM. WE NEED TO FIND A PATHWAY FOR THAT RETAINS ARE STRONG ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS. WHILE LEADING WELL DESIGNED OPERATIONS ACTUALLY GET INTO THE WATER. AND I WOULD LIKE TO EXTEND AN INVITATION TO ANYONE ON THE COMMITTEE TO COME OUT PER VISIT TO OUR OPERATIONS. HERE ON SMALLEST BAY. AND TO SEE WHAT WE'RE SO PROUD AND CONFIDENT ABOUT. COURSE AFTER THE PANDEMIC RESTRICTIONS RELAXED ALLOWED TRAVEL. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS. THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO TESTIFY TODAY ON AB THREE OH THREE. MY NAME IS DR HOLLY LIKE AND I'M AN ASSISTANT PROFESSOR AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA BARBARA WHERE THIRTY IMPACT IN INTERACTIONS WITH AQUACULTURE WILD FISHERIES AND CLIMATE CHANGE- I AM ALSO ONE OF THE PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATORS ON THE OCEAN PROTECTION COUNCIL CALIFORNIA AQUACULTURE ACTION PLANS AS WELL. THE COLLABORATORS WITH THE NATURE CONSERVANCY. WHILE NOW IN THE BY LETTER THAT. OR FARMING AND PARTICULARLY MARICULTURE IS A RELATIVELY SMALL GIVEN ITS POTENTIAL IN THE UNITED STATES INCLUDING CALIFORNIA. BUT WHAT NEW ACADEMIC WILL CONSERVATION RESEARCH IS NOW SHOWING IS THAT MIRACLE CURE DOES IN FACT HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO NOT TO BENEFIT PEOPLE BUT ALSO BENEFIT NATURE. THE TICKET ALERTLY TRAIL S. S. B. OKAY ON THE TYPE OF SKILL MANAGEMENT AND GOAL OF THAT PRODUCTION BUT THEM DIFFERENT THAN FARMED OYSTERS AS WE HEARD AND- WE CAN PROVIDE ECOSYSTEM SERVICES. LIKE INCLUDING LOCAL WATER QUALITY BRING SOME LEVEL OF ACIDIFICATION AND EVEN HELP CAPTURE CARBON. IMPORTANTLY IN THE SYTEM AS A WHOLE CAN BE A FOURTH OF THE OVERALL LOWER IMPACT FOOD PRODUCTION MAIN COMPARED TO OTHER FOOD SYSTEM ESPECIALLY. UNDER BASS NINETEEN FORMS MANAGEMENT PRACTICES. THE UNITED STATES IS IN FACT THE NUMBER ONE IMPORTING STEVEN COUNTRY IN THE WORLD AND CALIFORNIA ACCOUNTS FOR THE LARGEST PROPORTION OF NATIONAL PEOPLE'S CONSUMPTION AT ABOUT IS ONLY ANTICIPATED TO INCREASE INTO THE FUTURE. THIS BILL JUST BEGINS ADDRESSING THE NEED AND POTENTIAL FOR MORE EQUITABLE ACCOUNTING THE CALIFORNIA YOU CAN PRODUCTION CONSUMPTION CENTER GOALS FOR THE FUTURE OF MARICULTURE IN SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT THROUGH A PILOT PROCESS. AND BEGIN TO ALIGN WEARING FARMING WITHIN A CLIMATE CHANGE MITIGATION AND ADAPTIVE FRAMEWORK ESSENTIAL FOR MORE RESILIENT PEOPLE SYSTEM OVERALL.

THANK YOU- SHARE GARCIA AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS I'M LINDA KROP CHIEF COUNSEL OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE CENTER TESTING ON BEHALF OF THE GROUPS THAT SUBMITTED AN OPPOSED LETTER. MAKE KNOWLEDGE THE STATE'S INTEREST IN SUSTAINABLE AQUACULTURE HOWEVER WE BELIEVE THIS BILL IS PREMATURE AND UNNECESSARY THE OCEAN PROTECTION COUNCIL IS WORKING ON AND OFF THE CULTURE ACTION PLAN MULTIPLE STATE AGENCIES ARE WORKING ON AQUACULTURE PRINCIPLES A DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL MAILLET FISH AND GAME COMMISSION HAVE PREPARED AN AQUACULTURE INFORMATION REPORT WHICH WILL INFORM FURTHER ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW. AND MOST RECENTLY ACOSTA COMMISSION DEVELOPED A PERMIT GUIDE FOR AQUACULTURE IN CALIFORNIA THIS GUIDE WAS MANDATED LESS THAN TWO YEARS AGO BY SB TWO SIXTY TWO THE PURPOSE OF THE GUY JUST TO ASSIST APPLICANTS FOR MARINE AQUACULTURE RESTORATION PROJECT BY REDUCING DUPLICATIVE OVERLAPPING INFORMATION REQUIREMENTS INCREASING STATE AND FEDERAL AGENCY COORDINATION INCREASING REGULATORY CERTAINTY AND REDUCING THE TIME AND COST ASSOCIATED WITH SECURING A COASTAL DEVELOPMENT PERMIT. THE GUIDE INCLUDES DETAILED INFORMATION REGARDING THE PROCESS TIMELINE AND REQUIREMENTS FOR APPLICATIONS AS WELL AS THE ROLES OF VARIOUS STATE AGENCIES AS SUCH IT ENSURES. PROPER COORDINATION AND EFFICIENCY. SHE WE BELIEVE THAT AB THREE OH THREE WHAT INVESTOR THE WORK BEFORE DIFFICULT. WITH SB SIX TWO AND WHAT ROB MULTIPLE AGENCIES OF THEIR IMPORTANT REVIEW WITH ALREADY IN PARTICULAR THE BILL WOULD ELIMINATE THE COASTAL COMMISSION'S AUTHORITY DESPITE THE AGENCY'S PREPARATION OF THE GUIDE. AND THE FACT THAT THE COMMISSION HAS A VERY EFFICIENT HUNDRED REVIEW PROCESS. IN FACT THE AVERAGE REVIEW PERIOD FOR COASTAL DEVELOPMENT PERMIT IS ONLY FOUR AND A HALF MONTHS. AND THE COMMISSION ISSUED OR UPDATED APPROXIMATELY THIRTY SEVEN PERMITS FOR AQUACULTURE OPERATIONS JUST OVER THE PAST SIX YEARS. WITH MORE THAN 95% PROCESS AS ADMINISTRATIVE OR CONSENT CALENDAR ITEMS. GIVEN THE STATE'S RECENT PROGRESS IN COMPLIANCE WITH SB TWO SIXTY TWO I RESPECTFULLY URGE THE COMMITTEE TO VOTE NO ON THIS BILL. THANK YOU YEAH MONTHS SO WE HAVE ANOTHER WITNESS SPEAKING IN OPPOSITION ASHLEY EAGLE GIPSON. I CAN YOU HEAR ME OK YES THIS WILL SEE. WONDERFUL SACRAMENTO GARCIA HONORABLE COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS ASHLEY WILL AGAIN AND I AM THE CONSERVATION DIRECTOR WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL ACTION COMMITTEE OF WEST MARIN. I'M SPEAKING TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE GREAT SUPPLEMENT AND IMPOSE LETTER ON MARCH TWENTY SIX. WE OPPOSE THE BILL FOR MANY REASONS INCLUDING THE BILL'S FAILURE TO PRIORITIZE CAREFUL ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW THE LARGE UNPRECEDENTED PILOT AREA PROPOSED A LIMITED REGULATORY OVERSIGHT OVER THE PILOT AREA AND THE POTENTIAL CONFLICTS WITH OTHER STATEWIDE EFFORTS. REGARDING ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE EXTREMELY SHORT REVIEW TIMELINE WHICH APPEAR AT THE COMPLEX BUT THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT OR CEQA REQUIREMENTS THERE IS NO SIMPLE EXEMPTION FOR PILOT PROJECTS. ADEQUATE AN INDIVIDUALIZED ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW IF NOT POSSIBLE IN FOUR MONTHS OR TWO MONTHS FOR STATE GOVERNMENTS HAVE LEASES WHICH HAVE VERY LIMITED OVERSIGHT UNDER THE BELT. IN LIGHT OF THE FACT THAT CALIFORNIA ESTUARIES AND COASTAL WATERS ARE ALREADY FACING OCEAN ACIDIFICATION BIODIVERSITY LOSS IN C. LEVEL RISE AND OTHER THREATS DIRECTING CUMULATIVE IMPACT OF ANY TYPE IN DEVELOPMENT MUST BE CLOSELY CONSIDERED. ALONGSIDE OTHER CITING. BOTH AREAS ARE. LARGE APPROXIMATELY TIMES THAN THE AREA THAT IS CURRENTLY BEING. IN THE STATE PROPER CULTURE WHICH IS NOT THE SAME AS WHAT AREA THAT'S FULLY LEASED. HYLA AREAS ARE ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY LARGER IN SIZE AND LONGER IN DURATION SIMILAR PROJECTS AND OTHER EAST COAST STATES. COMPARE TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED ACRES ON A TWELVE YEAR PERIOD YOU LASSEN ONE ACRE AND ONE TO THREE YEARS FOR SOME OF THOSE OTHER EXAMPLES. AND WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE PILOT PROCESS ENDS IN TWENTY THIRTY SIX OR ONE OF THE PILOT PROJECTS ON SUCCESSFUL WITHOUT ADEQUATE OVERSIGHT FOR FUNDING FOR CLEAN UP COSTS. THE BILL ALSO APPEARED TO CONFLICT WITH THE STATE AND FEDERAL AFRICAN BILLION A THIRTY BY THIRTY FIVE DIVERSITY EFFORTS. THIS BILL DOES NOT REPRESENT THE BEST INTERESTS OF CALIFORNIA CITIZENS PROTECTION OF OUR PRICE LOOK CLOSER RESPONSES. AND WE RESPECTFULLY ENCOURAGES OUT NOW AND THE SPELL- I'M ALSO HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AND I THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. NOW WE'LL MOVE ON TO FOLKS IN THE ROOM. WHO WOULD LIKE TO OPPOSE THE BILL. SEE NO ONE ANYONE THE BILL ALL RIGHT WE HAVE A MOTION.

FAMILY PARKER HEAL THE BAY SUSAN JORDAN CALIFORNIA COASTAL PROTECTION NETWORK. SHE HAGENS COAST WALK OR CALIFORNIA COASTAL TRAIL ASSOCIATION. MARTUCCI REFERENCE OF THE EARTH ROSANNA MARINI ALL NORTHWEST ATLANTIC MARINE ALLIANCE BRANDEN DAWSON SIERRA CLUB CALIFORNIA. RIGHT NOW WITH THE CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY AND THE AND FINAL DEFENSE CENTER AND WENT ACROSS PARTY SPELL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU- SEEING THAT DON'T HAVE ANYONE ELSE- BECAUSE ENOUGH. TO BRING BACK THE BODY ANOTHER NUMBER FOLKS OF SOME QUESTIONS. GREAT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR- WORKING ON THIS ISSUE WE KNOW THAT THERE IS DEFINITELY A NEED FOR SUSTAINABLE AQUACULTURE AND IT'S TRICKY YOU HAVE AND I THINK A LOT OF THE- INERTIA THAT WE HAD- AND ESPECIALLY OVER THE RECENT DECADES- BUT IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE GET IT RIGHT SO THAT WE DON'T. CREATE A- AND THAT- NEGATIVE. ON THE ENVIRONMENT ON THE QUALITY OF THE PRODUCT THAT WE'RE TRYING TO BE ABLE TO PRODUCE AND- CERTAINLY- FOR BOTH A CONSUMPTIVE- SEAFOOD- SELF THIS IS ONE OF THOSE- THAT YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO IMPORT US MOSTLY FROM INTERNATIONAL RESOURCES- WHY NOT BE ABLE TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO USE OUR- OUR- THE COAST RIGHT OFF OF. THOSE MAILS MARCOS IN A AND A MORE IN A SMARTER WAY- BY THIS BILL FIRST OF ALL I WANT APPRECIATE IS NARROWED- TO SELFISH AND MORE IMPORTANTLY TO HELP WHICH WE KNOW IS- STARTED TO DISAPPEAR OFF OUR COASTLINE IT'S IMPORTANT WE CAN'T- THING STREAMLINED TO BE ABLE TO PROTECT BOTH OF THOSE. WELL PROTECT THE RESOURCE AND THEN ALSO BE ABLE TO GROW- ITSELF- HAS CRAFTED RIGHT NOW I'VE GOT A COUPLE OF ISSUES THAT I WANT I WANT WANT TO GET TO YES AND I JUST HOPE THAT I HAVE A COMMITMENT TO CONTINUE TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON SOME OF THESE- POINTS- ONE THIS PILOT ESTABLISHES A MINIMUM NUMBER AND THAT'S FIVE. OF THESE TRACKS- BUT IT DOESN'T ESTABLISH A MAXIMUM SO THEORETICALLY THERE COULD BE TWO HUNDRED OR MORE AND THEN YOU GET TO A POINT OUT THAT IT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE A PILOT ANYMORE FEELS LIKE A FULL BLOWN OPERATION- SO I'D ENCOURAGE YOU TO WORK WITH STAKEHOLDERS TO FIGURE OUT WHAT MAYBE THAT REASONABLE MAXIMUM NUMBER SHOULD BE- AND RELATED TO THAT A DISTANCE REQUIREMENTS BETWEEN. THE DIFFERENT TRACKS SITE SO YOU DON'T HAVE FIVE RIGHT NEXT TO EACH OTHER KIND OF DEFEATS THE PURPOSE OF. A THAT SECONDLY- IT REQUIRES ENVIRONMENTAL I'M LOOKING FOR MINIMAL ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS BASICALLY STUDY ABOUT WHERE THESE ARE GONNA BE LOCATED- AND MAYBE THIS IS INFERRED BUT NOTHING IN THE BILL RIGHT NOW ACTUALLY WOULD- IT WOULD REQUIRE- DONE. THE REGULATORY AGENCY TO HAVE TO CONTINUE ENVIRONMENTAL. MONITORING SO THE LAST THING THAT WE WANT. IS TO GO AHEAD AND GIVE THE- LIGHT AND THEN HOW SOME. ENVIRONMENT EFFECT THE SIR. AREA AN OFFER- SO I REALLY WANT TO SEE THAT STRENGTH AND TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A REQUIREMENT FOR ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING- CONDITIONS- THAT. ALSO WOULD- THAT WOULD WOULD REQUIRE. A TEMPORARY HALT. IN OPERATIONS SHOULD WE SEE SOME SORT OF ENVIRONMENTAL METRICS- NEGATIVELY AFFECTED. DURING THE COURSE OF ITS OPERATION- THIRDLY- YOU KNOW SENSITIVE WE'VE GOT. FULL APPRECIATION FOR THE ROLE THAT OUR COASTAL COMMISSION THE OCEAN PROTECTION COUNCIL AND OTHERS TO PLAY- BUT I ALSO UNDERSTAND WINE TO BE ABLE TO STREAMLINE THIS SORT OF MINIMUM AND LIKE TO. BE ABLE TO SEE- THE REQUIREMENT FOR DFW TO CONSULT. WITH THESE TWO ORGANIZATIONS OR OTHERS THAT MAYBE. TO THEIR POINTS HAVE HAD A LOT OF EFFORT A LOT OF DEVELOPMENT. A LOT OF FUN AND WE APPRECIATE THAT THOUGHT. INTO THE WORK THAT WE HAVE FOR AQUACULTURE- AND THEN- YOU KNOW THROUGH THAT. IF YOU KNOW I KNOW YOU'VE GOT SOME TIME POINTS IN HERE ABOUT A REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE- IF THINGS ARE LOOKING WELL AND- I KNOW THE NEXT REPORT WILL COME OUT IN THE YEAR TWENTY THIRTY- IF THERE IS A DIFFERENT DATE. YOU WANT TO LOOK AT THAT POSSIBLY SHOW THAT PILOT IS WORKING ON A VERY SMALL SCALE- THAT- THAT WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO REVISIT THIS ISSUE AND- AND SEE ABOUT A SCALING UP AGAIN BUT IF EVERYTHING LOOKS GOOD. LIKE CB HAD COMMITMENT TO WORK ON SOME OF THESE ISSUES ABSOLUTELY NO I REALLY APPRECIATE THE CALMEST AND AGREE WITH ALL THAT- YOU SUGGESTED. YOU KNOW AND WE- HAVE ENGAGES STAKEHOLDERS FROM FROM- THE MOMENT WE INTRODUCED THE BILL- AND- WE- WILL CONTINUE TO ENGAGE WITH THEM. YOU KNOW BUT I THINK SOME OF THESE SUGGESTIONS AT THE COASTAL COMMISSION IS. CUT OUT THAT'S NOT TRUE. THE LEGISLATION IF YOU LOOK AT THE LEGISLATION SPECIFICALLY STATES. THAT IT- I BELIEVE IT'S- THE DEPARTMENT OF- A VISION WILDLIFE THAT THEY ARE TO. CONSULT THAT THERE TO WORK WITH ALL OF THE REGULATORY AGENCIES- THAT- YOU KNOW WORK IN THIS SPACE IN THIS AREA. OF OCEAN FARMING. THAT THEY ARE GOING TO WORK TOGETHER. TO CREATE THIS MULTI AGENCY ADOPT THESE MULTI AGENCY REGULATIONS TO GOVERN THIS PILOT PROGRAM. AND SO THAT'S WHY WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT C. CO YOU TALK ABOUT. THE COASTAL ACT ALL OF THOSE. ISSUES ARE TO BE- TAKE PLACE. DURING THIS THIS. THIS PROMULGATION OF THE REGULATIONS THAT'S GONNA GOVERN THIS PROGRAM. YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE MAKING THIS SHIFT FROM A PROCESS THAT IS DETERMINING THESE PROJECT ON A PROJECT BY PROJECT BASIS- AND TRYING TO CREATE THE PARAMETERS. OF A- OF OPERATIONS- SO THAT WAY IF YOU HAVE- SOME POTENTIAL FARMERS THE MEET THOSE THAT CRITERIA BUT THEY DON'T- AND THAT'S WHY YOU KNOW WE THE BILL SPECIFIES ENFORCEMENT WHO WILL DO ENFORCEMENT- AND THEN OBVIOUSLY IT'S YOU KNOW BUT WE ARE LEAVING IT TO ALL OF THE REGULATORY AGENCIES THAT CURRENTLY- MANAGE THIS PROCESS. FOR PUTTING IT TO THEM TO DETERMINE HOW THIS PILOT PROGRAM IS GOING TO WORK. OKAY THANK YOU- WHITE AND HE DESERVES TO MOVE FORWARD AND DESERVES TO I CONTINUE TO HAVE THIS WORKED ON DIFFERENT FACTORS WE DON'T- WE WANT TO ACHIEVE THE GOALS IN THE END. THAT WE CAN TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DO IT RIGHT SO THANK YOU FOR ONE TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THOSE ISSUES ABSOLUTELY NO AND I APPRECIATE- THE SUGGESTIONS AND- I WILL CERTAINLY. FOLLOW UP.

LEVINE SUU KYI AND WHEN RUBIO RUBIO AYE SALAS SMITH. SMITH I'VE YET TO DO IT VIA DUBAI WARD WARD I. BENNETT I. COULD LEAVE THAT OPEN FOR OTHER MEMBERS AND I WOULD LIKE TO PRESENT YOUR SECOND FINAL BILL YES THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I AM HONORED TO PRESENT AB EIGHT OH FOUR WHICH WILL REDUCE FINANCIAL BARRIERS AND INCREASE ACCESS TO OUTDOOR SPORTS AND RECREATION FOR CALIFORNIANS THIS BILL DOES TO SIMPLE THINGS FIRST IT CLARIFIES CURRENT LAW WHICH ALLOWS THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE THE OPTION TO THAT DESIGNATE TO FREE HUNTING DATES PER YEAR. ONE IN THE FALL AND ONE IN THE WINTER THIS WAS ENACTED BY S. B. ELEVEN SEVENTY NINE WHICH WAS PASSED IN TWO THOUSAND AND TEN HOWEVER THE DIRECTOR HAS NEVER ACTUALLY DOESN'T NEED TO DAYS SO AB SO AB EIGHT OH FOUR REQUIRES THE DIRECTOR TO DESIGNATE. THOSE DAYS SECONDLY THE BILL CHANGES THE SEASONS FROM THE TWO FREE HUNTING DAYS TO FALL AND SPRING. UNDER AB EIGHT OH FOUR AN UNLICENSED HUNTER WHO HAS COMPLETED THE HUNTER SAFETY COURSE THAT'S- VERY IMPORTANT TO NOTE THEY'VE COMPLETED THE HUNTERS GIVES SAFETY COURSE. WOULD BE ALLOWED TO HUNT WITHOUT A LICENSE ON THESE TWO DAYS IF ACCOMPANIED. BY LICENSED HUNTERS TWENTY ONE YEARS OR OLDER WHO HAS HELD A VALID HUNTING LICENSE FOR AT LEAST THE LAST THREE CONSECUTIVE YEARS. TO ENSURE NECESSARY SAFETY IN THE FIELD LICENSE MENTORS WOULD BE RESTRICTED TO ONLY COMPANY ONE UNLICENSED HUNTER AT A TIME. AND THAT WOULD BE REQUIRED TO ALWAYS REMAIN AND CLOSE VISIBLE AND VERBAL CONTACT WITH THEM. THIS BILL CHANGES THE SEASONS OF THE FREE HUNTING DAYS TO SPRING AND FALL BECAUSE GAME SPECIES IN THOSE SEASONS. ARE IDEAL FOR NEW HUNTERS AS THEY HAVE LOW BARRIERS TO ENTRY AND MINIMAL. EQUIPMENT REQUIREMENTS THIS BILL HAS NO OPPOSITION AND RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE WITH ME TODAY. WITH ME TODAY TO- TESTIFY IN SUPPORT IS ROY GRIFFITH WHO IS RETIRED FISHING GAME WARDEN. AND ALSO BILL GAINS FROM THE CALIFORNIA HOMES BEEN FOR CONSERVATION THANK YOU DO ENJOY DO PASS RECOGNITION HAVE A MOTION A SECOND FIRST WITNESS. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF ROY GRIFFITHS BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO THE CALIFORNIA RIFLE AND PISTOL ASSOCIATION AGAINST SOMEONE SAID A RETIRED GAME WARDEN. TWENTY SEVEN YEARS AS A GAME WARDEN THE LAST FIFTEEN OF WHICH I AROUND THE STATE'S HUNTER EDUCATION PROGRAM. HISTORY THE BILL AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER SAID I'VE- BEEN INVOLVED IN SINCE TWO THOUSAND TEN- NO SAFETY CORNERS HAVE BEEN CUT ON THIS BILL AS MENTIONED. HUNDRED DUCATION AND THE CLASSIFICATION OF THE MENTOR OF ARE GOING TO BE VERY CLOSELY WATCHED. THIS IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE DECLINE OF HUNTERS IN CALIFORNIA IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES WE HAD OVER. SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND LICENSE HUNTERS IN THE STATE NOW WE HAVE LESS THAN THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND LICENSE UNDER THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THAT'S ABOUT A 65% LOSS AND FIVE. FIVE THOUSAND HUNDREDS A YEAR BASICALLY BEING LOST FROM THE STATE ALL THE TIME WHY WE HAVE. UPWARDS OF THIRTY THOUSAND STUDENTS GOING THROUGH HUNDREDS OCCASIONALLY YEAR IN CALIFORNIA WHICH BEGS THE QUESTION WHERE THE SPOKES GOING WIRE TO GET IN A HUNTING LICENCES. IT'S BEEN CHAU THROUGHOUT THE NATION NOT FINANCIAL COSTS ARE A BARRIER TO GETTING NEW FOLKS INTERESTED IN HUNTING. THIS IS JUST A SMALL STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION OF GETTING FOLKS INTERESTED GET THEM OUT THERE THE TRY BEFORE YOU BUY IT IDEA. HUNTERS ARE A CRITICAL TOOL IN WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT CALIFORNIA THEIR DOLLARS BRING IN HUNDREDS OF THOUSAND DOLLARS IN LICENSE FEES. AND APPLICATIONS TAGS ALONE NOT TO MENTION. ALL LAST YEAR ALONE ABOUT TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS IN PITTMAN ROBERTSON DOLLARS ARE COMING TO CALIFORNIA IT'S CRITICAL FOR HABITAT USE EDUCATION SO FORTH. AND AGAIN THIS IS NOT THERE'S NOT A ONE SIZE FITS ALL OVER ONE FIX FOR THIS BUT THIS BILL IS A CRITICAL STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. OF THE R. THREE MOVEMENT THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT READ TO RECRUIT RETRAIN REACTIVATE THE NEXT GENERATION. OF CALIFORNIA'S HUNTER CONSERVATIONIST AND AS WE DISCUSSED EARLIER THIS COMMITTEE GAME MORE INTEREST PRESS RELEASE FANS WE NEED LAW ABIDING EYES AND EARS OUT IN THE FIELD. HHONORS TURNED IN ALL KINDS OF POACHERS EVERY YEAR AND HELP. OUR GAME WARDENS MAKE THE CASES SO- FOR ALL THE REASONS REALLY. ALIVE OR THIS MEASURE THANK YOU THANK YOU. OUR NEXT WITNESS REGULAR OF. NUMBER MISTER CHAIRMAN CAN YOU HEAR ME OK. THE OKAY. YES PLEASE RIGHT. WE CAN HEAR YOU. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS BILL GAINES AND TODAY I'M PLEASED TO BE SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING FOR CONSERVATION. AND TWELVE OTHER WILDLIFE CONSERVATION ORGANIZATIONS IN STRONG SUPPORT OF AB EIGHT OH FOUR. TENURE REVENUES DURING THE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL WILDLIFE FIVE HUNDRED VIA THEIR PURCHASE OF HUNTING LICENCES SAMSTAG ANOTHER REQUIRED PERMITS PROVIDE SUBSTANTIAL FUNDING TO THE DEPARTMENT. TO CONDUCT PROGRAMS ARE PROJECTS CRITICAL TO THE HEALTH OF CALIFORNIA'S WILDLIFE RESOURCES RECOGNIZING THE IMPORTANCE OF THESE ANNUAL REVENUES TO THEIR WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES THE DEPARTMENT IS CURRENTLY ENGAGED IN A MAJOR EFFORT TO RECRUIT RETAIN AND REACTIVATE HUNTERS IN CALIFORNIA. THAT C. R. THREE THAT MISTER GRIFFIN JUST FOR TWO. SINCE NINETEEN NINETY ONE THE DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH WILDLIFE HAS AUTHORIZED TO FIFTEEN DAYS AFTER SUCCESSFULLY LED TO INCREASE PARTICIPATION IN FISHING BY CALIFORNIA PUBLIC. AND THE ANNUAL REVENUES TO ANGLERS GENERATE TO THE DEPARTMENT FORFEITURE RELATED PROGRAMS AND PROJECTS. SINCE TWENTY TWELVE THE DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL WILDLIFE HAS ALSO HAD THE ABILITY TO AUTHORIZED TO THREE HUNDRED DAYS BUT AS OF TODAY THEY HAVE NOT DONE SO. IT'S IMPERMANENT PRISON WITNESS LEGISLATION WILL HAVE THE SAME POTENTIAL POSITIVE EFFECT AS THREE FIFTEEN DAYS AND INCREASE THE NUMBER OF HUNTING LICENSES AND RELATED PERMITS SOLD. IN THE ANNUAL REVENUES THEY GENERATE TO THE DEPARTMENT FOR PROGRAMS AND PROJECTS THAT ARE CRITICAL TO OUR STATE'S WILDLIFE. ANOTHER POSITIVE CHANGE EIGHT ZERO FOUR WOULD MAKE TO EXISTING LAWS IT WOULD CHANGE THE SEASONS OF FREE HUNTING DAYS AUTHORIZED FROM FALL AND WINTER TO SPRING AND FALL. THIS CHANGES CRITICAL OF HUNTING TURKEYS DURING THE SPRING HUNTING SEASON WHICH IS CURRENTLY ON RIGHT NOW. IS THE BEST INTRODUCTORY GAME SPECIES WITH LOW BARRIERS TO ENTRY MINIMALLY CRIMINAL REQUIREMENTS AND. RELATIVELY HIGH SUCCESS RATES. IT'S ALSO WORTH NOTING THAT ALTHOUGH THIS BILL IS LATE AS- A DAYS LET'S JUST. THAT PATTERSON BIT OF A MESS. DEPENDING ON THE- THAT THE ON. TO BE ON A LED. IT IS BUT FREE. THE LEGISLATION REQUIRES THAT ANY UNLIKE HUNDREDS PROTEST. IS REQUIRED TO PURCHASE HAVING THEIR- ANYWAY. DANCE STAMPS OR OTHER PRINT. IN THE SUBJECT ARE REALLY. PUT TO ALLOW. HUNTER BURNING OUT A HOT LIQUID YOU NEED HOW DO WE TO GO OUT OF SUCCESS CAN BE COPPER. WHICH IS LIKE WHY MAY IN. WHO ARE INTERESTED IN HUNTING WILL TAKE ON A SAFETY COURSE BUT. NOT POSSESS THE HUNTING LICENCES. NO PROGRESSIVE POP PLAYING. A MENTAL TO TAKE DECENT IN THE- OUT IN THE FIELD OF THEM WHERE TO GO AND WHAT THE TO KNOW TO. EXCEL PASSED IT INTO AB.

THAT IS DRAWING AUTHORED BY MYSELF AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER MULLIN AND OVER A DOZEN OTHER COLLEAGUES WHO HAVE SIGNED ON IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE. WHETHER SMOKE FROM WILDFIRES INCREASING TEMPERATURES WATER RATIONING BECAUSE THIS DROUGHT. THE NEW TO PROVIDE SAFE CLEAN DRINKING WATER FLOODING WHEN IT'S TOO WET OR SEA LEVEL RISE WE ALL KNOW. WHAT CLIMATE CHANGE LOOKS LIKE AND ALL THE PARTS OF THE STATE. THAT IS BECAUSE ALL OF OUR DISTRICTS ARE EXPERIENCING ONE OR MORE OF THESE IMPACTS EVERY SINGLE DAY EACH YEAR THE SITUATION BECOMING MORE URGENT. IN OUR COMMUNITIES ARE FALLING FURTHER BEHIND. AS YOU ALL KNOW LAST YEAR WAS CALIFORNIA'S WORSE FIRE SEASON. RECORD WITH OVER FOUR POINT TWO MILLION ACRES BURNED THIS IS ON THE HEELS. THE RECORD FIRE SEASONS IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. THE L. SEVENTEEN. WITH MULTI MILLION ACRES OF BEING BURNED THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THESE FIRES IMPACT THE INTERSTATE THROUGH WORSE. AND CONTRIBUTE TO WORSE AIR QUALITY. EVEN WHEN WE CAN'T SEE THOSE FLAMES. LIKEWISE WE ARE ENTERING OF THE DROUGHT AFTER RECENTLY EXPERIENCING THE WORST DROUGHT ON RECORD. AND WE HAVE THIS CLIMATE CHANGE BOND PROPOSAL. WOULD ENSURE THAT WE DRESS MANY OF THOSE ISSUES. ALL THIS SPEAKS TO WHY SB FIFTEEN HUNDRED IS URGENTLY NEEDED THE INVESTMENTS OUTLINED IN THE BILL WILL MAKE COMMUNITIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA BETTER PREPARED TO DEAL WITH CLIMATE CHANGE. IMPACTS CALIFORNIA CAN CONTINUE TO LEAD THE WAY. ON RESPONDING TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND AVOID THAT DIRE PREDICTIONS THAT WE ALL HEAR ABOUT CONSTANTLY. REPORTER WORKING WITH ALL OF YOU AS THE BILL MOVES THROUGH THE PROCESS. AND ENSURE THAT ALL OF THE DIVERSE NEEDS OF THE STATE ARE INCLUDED I'VE HAD SOME GREAT CONVERSATIONS WITH SOME OF YOU. LOOKING FORWARD TO BROADER DISCUSSIONS WITH ALL OF THE- EXCEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. WILL. HAVE A DRINK OVER WITH THE BAY AREA COUNCIL AND REGAL MASTRODONATO WITH THE TRUST FOR PUBLIC LAND ON THE LINE OVER. HERE IN PERSON TO UP PROVIDES INCOME SUPPORT. THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR ATTENTION. MORE FROM WITNESS IN SUPPORT. GOOD EVENING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS RICO MASTRODONATO WITH THE TRUST FOR PUBLIC LAND AND I OF COURSE WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR INTRODUCING THIS BILL- YOU KNOW AT THIS POINT I DO. ACKNOWLEDGE AND THANK THAT VIRTUALLY EVERYBODY IN CALIFORNIA KNOWS ABOUT FLYING TO CHANGE- AND- AND I THINK IN PART THAT'S BECAUSE CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN LEADING HE WAY ON ADDRESSING CLIMATE CHANGE- SINCE WELL WATER SINCE THE BEGINNING. AND WHAT'S LESS OBVIOUS IS OF THE BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS CALIFORNIA'S INVESTED. ADDRESSING CLIMATE CHANGE ABOUT TRANSPORTATION AND ENERGY PROJECTS AND- STRATEGIES- WE NEED THIS BOND IT'S NOT COMING THROUGH THE STATE- WE GOT SOME MONEY THROUGH THE BUDGET THIS YEAR BECAUSE OF THIS- AFOREMENTIONED SURPLUS. BUT TYPICALLY WE REALLY RELY ON BONDS AND WE ARE VERY MUCH RELYING ON A CLIMATE BONDTO PASS THE LEGISLATURE THIS YEAR. THE TRUST FOR PUBLIC LANDS- YOU KNOW OUR EXPERTISE DISS BUILDING PARKS AND WE WORK IN LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES- ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA MENTIONED. MANY OF THE- SUBJECTS THAT THIS BILL IS GOING TO ADDRESS I'M GOING TO FOCUS MY COMMENTS ON HEAT. I THINK THAT THAT IS A AREA THAT THE STATE OF THEM WILLFULLY IGNORING DESPITE ITS EMINENT DANGER- AND WHAT SCIENCE IS TELLING US- SCIENCE IS TELLING US TO BUT- THE WORLD IS GETTING CUT HOTTER. CALIFORNIA CERTAINLY AS LAST YEAR WAS THE HOTTEST YEAR ON RECORD AUGUST THROUGH SEPTEMBER OCTOBER WAS THE HOTTEST IN CALIFORNIA HISTORY WE HAVE TO NATURE BASED. PROGRAMS THAT MITIGATE HEAT IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA URBAN FORESTRY AND URBAN GREENING URBAN FORESTRY IS ZEROED OUT. IN THE BUDGET URBAN FORESTRY IS GETTING TWENTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS TEN FROM LAST YEAR AND THIRTEEN FROM THIS YEAR. SO- AS I MENTIONED HE DOES EMINEM WE COULD HAVE A HEAT WAVE IN A COUPLE OF MONTHS HE KILLS MORE PEOPLE THAN ANY OTHER WEATHER RELATED EVENTS CERTAINLY PUTS MORE PEOPLE IN THE HOSPITAL AND IT'S OUR LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES THAT ARE THE MOST VULNERABLE I WANT TO THANK. ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA FOR ACKNOWLEDGING THIS WITH THE HEAT CHAPTER IN HIS- LEGISLATION. THERE FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR AB THIRTY ONE. THAT'S A LOCAL PARK PROGRAM OBVIOUSLY THAT'S GOING TO THAT PROGRAM IS FOCUSED ON LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES TO QUALIFY FOR THE GRANTS SO IT'S AUTOMATICALLY GOING TO GO TO LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES AND- YOU KNOW INCOME. HIM GREEN SPACES ENTRY CANOPY ARE BUT A BASICALLY A 100% CORRELATION IF YOUR HOUSEHOLD INCOME IS LOW YOU DON'T HAVE GREEN SPACES YOU DON'T HAVE TREE CANOPY AND ALSO SOME OF THE HOTTEST PLACES IN THE STATE. ARE IN LOS ANGELES LAST YEAR THERE WAS A GROUND SURFACE TEMPERATURE OF ALMOST A HUNDRED AND FIFTY DEGREES I CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT IT WAS LIKE AN ASSEMBLYMEMBER GARCIA'S DISTRICT. CALEXICO COACHELLA AT CETERA. WE NEED TO DEAL WITH THIS. WE ARE EXTREMELY SUPPORTIVE OF THIS BILL. WE SUBMITTED SOME AMENDMENTS. BASICALLY TO INCREASE MONEY TO ADDRESS HEAT- WE WANT TO PRESERVE THE AB THIRTY ONE MONEY BUT- OUR URBAN GREENING IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT IT'S OVERSUBSCRIBED JUST LIKE AB THIRTY MONTH. MAYBE THIRTY ONE HAD A SEVEN HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR PER PROP SIXTY EIGHT THEY GOT SIX BILLION DOLLARS IN APPLICATIONS. SO AND URBAN GREENING IS SIMILAR. THEY ARE DIFFERENTLY FOCUSED URBAN GREENING IS A MORE FLEXIBLE PROGRAM THAT CAN. DO ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE AND SO ON- BUT THEY BOTH THE CROPS IS SAME THING. MITIGATING HEAT SO. LONG AND SHORT OF IT IS AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. WE NEED THIS BILL. WE NEED TO CONTINUE ADDRESSING WILDFIRES WE HAVE EIGHT HUNDRED MILES OF COAST. AGRICULTURE IS THE NUMBER ONE BUSINESS. AND HE IS COMING. AS GOING TO BE EXTREMELY HAS ALREADY BEEN HARMFUL. SO I URGE YOUR VOTE I THANK THE MEMBER FOR AND THE OTHER MEMBERS THAT ARE CO AUTHORS. AND THE THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU IN THE NEXT WITNESS ON THE PHONE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIRMAN- COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER MALL AND ON BEHALF OF THE LARGEST EMPLOYERS AND THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA. THE DAIRY COUNCIL IS PLEASED TO SUPPORT AB FIFTEEN HUNDRED AND RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR I. ABOUT WITHIN THE PAST SEVEN YEARS CALIFORNIA'S ALREADY VOLATILE CLIMATE HAS SHATTERED LONG STANDING CLIMATE RECORDS RELATED TO DROUGHT WILDFIRE HEAT. AND FLOOD EVENTS THESE DISASTERS DAMAGED ECOSYSTEMS DAY HER COMMUNITIES AND DISRUPT AND TOO OFTEN COST LIVES. THE TWENTY TWENTY TWELVE TO TWENTY SIXTEEN DROUGHT FOR EXAMPLE COST THREE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS IN ECONOMIC LOSSES AND NEARLY THIRTY THOUSAND JOBS THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN WILDFIRES ALONE COST. ALMOST A HUNDRED AND FIFTY BILLION DOLLARS IN LOSSES AND KILLED A HUNDRED THREE CALIFORNIANS. THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN FLIGHTS COST SEVENTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS IN LOSSES IN SAN JOSE ALONE AND NEARLY TOPPLED THE OROVILLE DAM EMERGENCY SPILLWAY. AND AUGUST TWENTY TWENTY WAS THE HOTTEST MONTH IN STATE HISTORY EXTREME HEAT IS CAUSING INCREASED NUMBERS OF PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFF OF THAT AND SWOLLEN BLACKOUTS AND AVERAGING ABOUT FORTY DEATHS EACH YEAR AS INDICATED BY THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER. AB FIFTEEN HUNDRED WOULD INVEST SIX POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS IN UPGRADING AND IMPROVING THE RESILIENCE OF CALIFORNIA'S NEIGHBORHOODS. BUSINESSES INFRASTRUCTURE AND ECOSYSTEMS THESE AND OTHER CLIMATE RELATED CHALLENGES AND IN DOING SO AB FIFTEEN HUNDRED WOULD NOT ONLY HELP SAVE LIVES AND AVOID COSTLY DAMAGES FROM WILD FROM CLIMATE RELATED DISASTERS. THAT WOULD ALSO HELP CREATE JOBS STIMULATE GROWTH IMPROVE ECOSYSTEM HEALTH AND PROTECT COMMUNITIES. ACCORDING TO ANALYSIS CONDUCTED BY THE BAY AREA COUNCIL- EARLIER LAST YEAR A BOND MEASURE OF SIMILAR SIZE AND STRUCTURE- AB FIFTEEN HUNDRED IT WOULD CREATE. BETWEEN SEVENTY TO IN A TWO FIVE JOB. AND GENERATE BETWEEN NINE POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS AND FIFTEEN BILLION DOLLARS IN TOTAL ECONOMIC ACTIVITY ACROSS CALIFORNIA. PUTTING PEOPLE TO WORK TO STRENGTHEN THEIR NATURAL ENVIRONMENT IS AN AMERICAN TRADITION GOING BACK TO THE NEW DEAL. AND THE MOST RECENT POLLING SHOWS A STRONG MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIANS WOULD SUPPORT A CLIMATE RESILIENCE BOND.

ALLOW THE ISSUANCE OF FUNDS TO CITY. ROSE ORGANIZATIONS- IN PARTICULAR THERE'S A JOINT POWER AUTHORITY THAT'S ALREADY FORMED. THE DEALING WITH THE TRYING TO ATTEMPT TO DEAL WITH SEA LEVEL RISE IN VENTURA AND SANTA BARBARA COUNTIES- AND THIS BOND WOULD DOES CERTAINLY HELP AN ORGANIZATION LIKE THAT APPLY FOR FUNDING.

WELCOME THANK YOU MA'AM CHAIR- WE'LL TAKE A BRIEF MOMENT TO THINK- THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS MEASURE FORWARD. IT'S NO SECRET THAT THESE INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS ARE CRUZ CRITICALLY NEEDED. EVERY YEAR CALIFORNIA'S SEES A WHOLE WARMTH OF CLIMATE CHANGE TAKING PLACE. AS THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN IN THE WORLD TOO MANY PEOPLE DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO CLEAN WATER. AND DRINKING WATER TOO MANY PEOPLE ARE SUBJECT TO CLIMATE DISASTER. WE CAN SIT BACK AND DO NOTHING HOPING THAT THESE DAYS WILL PASS WITH MINIMUM DAMAGE.
