COMMITTEE. THE SENATE BUDGET BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE ON EDUCATION AND ALSO THE ASSEMBLY BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE ON EDUCATION FINANCE. THE THE PURPOSE OF THIS HEARING THIS MORNING IS TO DISCUSS MANY BUT CERTAINLY NOT ALL AS WE WENT THROUGH THE. COMPILING OF THIS SCHEDULE BUT MANY OF THE ISSUES THAT ARE UNIQUE TO SPECIAL EDUCATION FINANCE IN OUR STATE. WE WILL HEAR HOW SPECIAL EDUCATION FUNDING RATES VARIES. FUNDING RATES VARY WIDELY ACROSS THE STATE AND ALSO HOW THAT IMPACTS INSTRUCTION AND SERVICES. TO SOME OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE STUDENTS. WILL ALSO LEARN ABOUT TRENDS IN THE TYPES OF DISABILITIES BEING IDENTIFIED COSTS OF SERVICES THE CHALLENGES OF. PROVIDING A HIGH QUALITY FREE APPROPRIATE EDUCATION. PUBLIC PUBLIC EDUCATION. THIS HEARING WILLEXPLORE CHALLENGES FACED BY LARGE AND SMALL SCHOOL DISTRICTS CELTA'S THAT ARE FUNDED AT LOW RATES DISTRICTS THAT SERVE STUDENTS WITH LOW INCIDENCE. DISABILITIES AND THOSE PROVIDING PRESCHOOL FOR STUDENTS WITH EXCEPTIONAL NEEDS. LAST YEAR WE SAW SIGNIFICANT LEGISLATIVE ATTEMPTS TO INCREASE FUNDING FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION IS A MEMBER OF DONAL. ARE SO MEDICATION CHAIR HE INTRODUCED AB THREE TWELVE. WHICH WOULD HAVE EQUALIZED EDUCATION FUNDING AT THE NINETIETH PERCENTILE AND CREATED A FUNNY MECHANISM FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION PRESCHOOL. AS A MEMBER OF OUR TEAM AND I INTRODUCED A B. FOURTEEN FORTY NINE WHICH WOULD HAVE ADDED A SPECIAL EDUCATION GRANT. TO THE LCS PFAFF BASED ON THE PERCENTAGE OF STUDENTS WHO ARE SEVERELY DISTURBED DISABLED. IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN ITEMS SP TEN SEVENTY ONE TO PROVIDE A PERMANENT ONE TIME ADJUSTMENT TO SUPPORT. SPECIAL EDUCATION RELATED SERVICES FOR PRESCHOOL CHILDREN WITH EXCEPTIONAL NEEDS. BUT NONE OF THESE FIVE FOR BOTH THOSE WERE ULTIMATELY SUCCESSFUL AND I THINK WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO TODAY IS CONTINUE THESE CONVERSATIONS AND DEVELOP SOME SOLUTIONS TO MANY OF THESE LONG STANDING FUNDING ISSUES. ALL WITH THE GOAL OF BETTER SUPPORTING STUDENTS. WITH EXCEPTIONAL NEEDS AND ALSO ALL THE GOAL. TOWARD OF SUPPORTING THOSE SCHOOLS THAT SERVE THOSE STUDENTS. WITH EXCEPTIONAL NEEDS SO. I WANNA THANK EVERYBODY FOR BEING HERE TODAY WE'VE GOT A A VERY FULL AGENDA SO I I REALLY WANT TO KEEP IT ON TRACK ON TIME. AND. LOOK TO SEE IF A CINEMA MCCARTY CHAIR OF THE BUDGET SEVEN ASSEMBLY SIDE WOULD LIKE TO MAKE SOME OPENING REMARKS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR JUST A FEW OPENING COMMENTS FROM THE ASSEMBLY SITE I FIRST OF ALL ARE SIMPLY AT CHAIRPERSON MISTER O'DONNELL COULD NOT BE HERE IS IN HIS DISTRICT SO. ASSET DIE AT TAKE THE LEAD FROM THE ASSEMBLY SIDE AND WHEN I THINK OF COURSE. LEADERSHIP IN THIS TOGETHER BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY ARE PRACTITIONERS OUT THERE TODAY WHO ARE GOING TO HEAR FROM A LITTLE BIT WE APPRECIATE YOU AND YOU'RE SHARING YOUR PERSPECTIVE ON WHAT'S REALLY HAPPENING IN OUR SCHOOLS ACROSS CALIFORNIA. KNOW LOTS BEEN HAPPENING IN OUR SCHOOL SYSTEM THE LAST FEW YEARS CERTAINLY A NEW FUNDING PROPOSAL LCS PFAFF ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM. OUR OUR CERTAINLY OUR CURRICULUM WITH A COMMON CORE. THAT WE HAVEN'T REALLY HAD DONE A LOT AS FAR AS THAT OUR SPECIAL ED FINANCE SYSTEM WE HAD A MAJOR REFORM OF COURSE TWENTY YEARS AGO. A LOT HAS CHANGED AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THIS AND HOW IT'S REALLY IMPACTING OUR SCHOOLS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA HAVING A MEANINGFUL DISCUSSION AS FAR AS SPECIAL EDUCATIONFINANCE. AS WAS NOTED THIS DISCUSSED AS LONG OVER DUE THERE'S BEEN SOME PROPOSAL LAST YEAR'S PRODUCT HOLISTIC LOOK ON THE OVERALL FUNDING STRUCTURE. SO THAT CERTAINLY THE THE THE GOALS IN THE OUTSET TODAY AND I LOOK FORWARD TO A ROBUST HEARING THANK YOU. SO I ONE WE HAVE RAIN ANDERSON FROM ELIO COME UP AD AND GET PREPARED FOR HIS OVERVIEW HISTORY OF SPECIAL EDUCATION FINANCE IN THE STATE. AND IF THERE ANY MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEES WHO LIKE TO MAKE SOME OPENING REMARKS WOULD LOVE TO GIVE AN OPPORTUNITY MISTER THOMAS. WELL I JUST THANK THE SENATOR ALLEN. IN THE ASSEMBLY WORKING TOGETHER ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE. I MEAN SHOULDN'T HERE FOR SIX YEARS AND WATCH AND OTHER DIFFERENT HEARINGS ON DISCUSSION. WE KNOW WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE. AND WE KNOW THE VALUE OF DEALING WITH. CHILDREN WITH SPECIAL NEEDS EARLY ON AN EARLY COGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT CAN HAVE GREAT RESULTS LATER ON THEIR LIFE. SO WE CLEARLY KNOW WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE. THE ISSUER I THINK WE'VE FALLEN DOWN IS IS IN THE FUNDING OF IT. SO I LOOK FORWARD TO DISCUSSIONS AS WE GO FORWARD AT THIS I THINK IT'S A. BIPARTISAN ISSUE. BECAUSE THESE ARE SOME ARE MOST VULNERABLE IN THE STATE THAT WE CAN INCREASE THEIR QUALITY OF LIFE NOT ONLY FOR THEM BUT FOR THEIR FAMILIES SO LOOK FORWARD TO THE DISCUSSION. YOU SENT OVER A CENTER CAN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I WANT ALSO THINK YOU WANT THEM LOOKING FOR TODAY'S HEARING. AS A PEDIATRICIAN ACTUALLY SERVES AS A MEDICAL CONSULTANT FIRST. MY LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICT A SEXY UNIFIED. WE WORK TOGETHER AND WORK TOGETHER WITH OUR SCHOOL NURSES SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGISTS ARE TO TRY TO ADDRESS. HEALTH ISSUES AND MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES FOR CHILDREN WHO. ARE IN SCHOOL CLEARLY THE SPECIAL ED SUCH OCCASIONS VERY IMPORTANT PART OF THAT WE ALSO HEAR HAPPENED SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON SOME SPECIAL NEEDS AND RECOGNIZING THAT. SPECIAL EDUCATION IS ONE OF THE. BUCKETS IN WHICH CHILDREN GET SERVICES BUT OFTEN NOT COORDINATED WITH OTHER PARTS NOT BECAUSE A SPECIAL ITSELF BUT BECAUSE THE DIFFERENT. PARTS OF ALWAYS TALK TO EACH OTHER THE OTHER THING I THINK IN TERMS OF SINS WERE FOCUSING ON FINANCING IS. REALLY LOOKING AT HOW. YOU KNOW DIFFERENT SOURCES OF FUNDING INCLUDING LOOKING AT WHERE CAN WE GET. FUNDING FOR HEALTH SERVICES ARE DELIVERED PARTICULARLY TO CHILDREN OF WHICH HALF OF ALL CALIFORNIA CHILDREN ARE ON. THROUGH THE MEDICARE PROGRAM AS WELL AND I KNOW THAT MANY OF US HAVE WORKED TOGETHER LOOKING AT. MEDICARE. PAYMENTS FOR. EDUCATION BASED. HEALTH SERVICES SO WIDE BEGIN LOOKING FOR TWO DISCUSSION TODAY. THE CENTER. TWENTY. SO I WANT TO COMPLIMENT. SENATOR ALAN FOR. AND ALL OF THE THE COMMITTEES THAT ARE WORKING TOGETHER THIS VERY IMPORTANT SUBJECT. ON THE FATHER OF A SIXTEEN YEAR OLD HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT TEN. IN ON CAMPUS QUITE OFTEN AND IT IS A CONVERSATION THAT JUST AVERAGE PARENTS EVERY DAY. TALK ABOUT. AND IT'S OFTEN THE SUBJECT THAT. THE LEGISLATURE DOES IT BUT. FRONT CENTER. THE CHALLENGES JUST GENERAL EDUCATION BUDGET CHALLENGES. EVERY YEAR WE WE GRAPPLE WITH IN A PARTICULAR ARE SPECIAL NEEDSSTUDENTS MANY OF WHOM ARE IN FOSTER CARE. WHICH IS ALSO A PART AND PARCEL TO THIS CONVERSATION O. YOU KNOW AS BUDGETS OF A ONE SHARE IT'S A. TOPIC THAT'S ON THE FRONT PAGE THIS YEAR AND I KNOW SENATOR ALLEN'S LEADERSHIP IS AS BEEN TREMENDOUS AND I KNOW. MY COLLEAGUE IN THE ASSEMBLY MISTER MCCARTY SHARES THE THE GOLAN THE MISSION TO TRY TO. MAKE SOME BUDGETARY SENSE OUT OF THIS BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY THE MORE WE INVEST IN THESE KIDS SOME THE BETTER OFF THEY'LL BE SO I'M LOOKING FOR THE HEARING THAT THE CONVERSATIONS SO THANK YOU FOR COMING IN. CENTER. OKAY SO TO KICK US OFF WE'RE GONNA HAVE RYAN ANDERSON FROM THE LA EL WHO IS OUR FISCAL POLICY NOW ANALYSTS IT'S GONNA. TALK IS ABOUT THE HISTORY OF SPECIAL EDUCATION FINANCE GIVEN OVERVIEW OF THE CURRENT SYSTEM. MISTER ANDERSON. IN MORNING RYAN ANDERSON LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WILL BE SPEAKING THIS MORNING FROM A HANDOUT THAT WAS INCLUDED IN YOUR PACKET AND FOR THE PUBLIC THAT'S IN ATTENDANCE. THEIR EXTRA COPIES OF THIS HANDOUT ON THE SERGEANT'S DESK. THE FIRST PAGE OF THIS HANDOUT WE JUST HAVE SOME BRIEF BACKGROUND. ON WHAT IS SPECIAL EDUCATION. AND SPECIAL EDUCATION IS A SERIES OF POLICIES LARGELY SET BY FEDERAL LAW. WHICH STATE THAT PUBLIC SCHOOLS MUST PROVIDE SPECIAL SUPPORT TO ALL STUDENTS WHO HAVE DISABILITIES THAT IT IMPACT THEIR LEARNING. NOW THESE DISABILITIES RANGE FROM THE RELATIVELY MILD SUCH AS SPEECH IMPAIRMENTS TO THE RELATIVELY SEVERE SUCH AS DEAFNESS OR VISUAL IMPAIRMENTS. AND FOR EACH CHILD THAT IS IDENTIFIED WITH THE DISABILITY. THEIR PARENTS THEIR TEACHERS THE SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS MEET AT LEAST ANNUALLY TO DEVELOP WHAT IS KNOWN AS AN. INDIVIDUALIZED EDUCATION PROGRAM OR IBP THIS IS A LEGAL DOCUMENT WHICH SPECIFIES THE SPECIFIC SERVICES EACH INDIVIDUAL STUDENT REQUIRES. IN ORDER TO. MAKE UP THAT DIFFERENCE OF WITH THE GENERAL EDUCATION POPULATION. NOW THESE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED IN MAINSTREAM CLASSES WHENEVER POSSIBLE AND THE LAST POINT ON THIS FIRST PAGE. IS A IS A GRAPH THAT. CHARTS THE MOST COMMON DISABILITIES BY GRADE. AND THE FIRST THING TO POINT OUT HERE IS THAT MOST CHILDREN IN SPECIAL EDUCATION. AND SPECIAL EDUCATION MAKES UP. ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA PUBLIC SCHOOLS. OF THAT SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND ABOUT SIXTY PERCENT HAVE ONE OF TWO. OF RELATIVELY MILD DISABILITIES IN THE EARLIER GRADES THAT'S PRIMARILY SPEECH IMPAIRMENT SUCH AS STUTTERING THE LATER GRADES IS PRIMARILY SPECIFIC LEARNING DISORDERS. SUCH AS DYSLEXIA. ON THE SECOND PAGE. OF WE HAVE. INTRODUCTION TO THE BASIC CONCEPTS THAT DRIVE SPECIAL EDUCATION FUNDING THIRD TWO PRINCIPLES I WANNA HIGHLIGHT HERE. THE FIRST IS THAT SPECIAL EDUCATION STUDENTS ARE. CONSIDERED GENERAL EDUCATION STUDENTS FIRST THAT MEANS THEY RECEIVE A INSTRUCTION THE SAME CURRICULUM OFTEN FROM THE SAME TEACHERS IN THE SAME CLASSROOM AS THEIR PEERS WHO DO NOT HAVE DISABILITIES. AND THEY GENERATE THE SAME FUNDING TO THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA TO SUPPORT THOSE ACTIVITIES. NOW IN ADDITION TO THE GENERAL EDUCATION CURRICULUM. EACH STUDENT'S I EP SPECIFIES ITS SERVICES THAT IMPOSE EXCESS COSTS. NOW TO COVER THOSE EXCESS COSTS WE HAVE A SHARED RESPONSIBILITY BETWEEN THREE DIFFERENT FONTS FORCES. FIRST THE STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENTS PULLED DISTRIBUTE CATEGORICAL FUNDING WHICH CAN ONLY BE SPENT ON IP SERVICES. AND THEN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THAT CATEGORICAL FUNDING AND THE REMAINING COST OF THOSE SERVICES IS COVERED BY LOCAL GENERAL PURPOSE FUNDS SO THAT THESE ARE FUNDS REDIRECTED FROM OTHER SOURCES IN MANY CASES LCF. BUT THE INTENT OF THAT LOCAL GENERAL PURPOSE CONTRIBUTION IS TO ENSURE THAT SCHOOLS HAVE AN INCENTIVE. TO KEEP THEIR SPECIAL EDUCATION COSTS AS LOW AS IT IS IS POSSIBLE AS WHILE STILL PROVIDING ADEQUATE SERVICES. THE SPECIFIC SHARE OF THESE COSTS IS REPRESENTED IN THE FIGURE ON PAGE TWO THAT'S THAT'S IN THE MOST RECENT DATE IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN SIXTEEN. THAT SHOWS THAT THE LOCAL GENERAL PURPOSE CONTRIBUTION NOW MAKES UP THE MAJORITY OF EXPENDITURES IN SPECIAL EDUCATION SERVICES WHO SPENT SIXTY PERCENT IN THIS YEAR. NOW THAT SHARE HAS CHANGED AWFUL LOT OVER TIME IT'S BEEN GROWING FOR MANY YEARS WE'LL TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHY THAT IS. BUT FOR NOW WE'RE GOING TO FOCUS ON THAT SLICE LABELED STATES SPECIAL EDUCATION. AND THAT SLICES HAS GONE THROUGH AT LEAST THREE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN CALIFORNIA'S HISTORY. ON PAGE THREE WE TALK ABOUT THE EARLIEST HISTORY OF A STATE SPECIAL EDUCATION FUNDING. OUT IN THE EARLY TWENTIETH CENTURY. CALIFORNIA AND DEVELOPED A PATCH WORKS A SERIES OF CATEGORICAL PROGRAMS EACH TARGETING. A SPECIFIC DISABILITY AND A SPECIFIC TYPE OF SERVICE. FOR SUPPORTING THAT DISABILITY PATCHWORK SYSTEM HAD SEVERAL PROBLEMS FIRST IT WAS NOT INCLUSIVE OF ALL STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES SECOND. IT WOULD IS VERY COMPLICATED THERE ARE MANY RULES THAT HAD TO BE FOLLOWED AND MASTERED. AND THIRD IT HAD SOME INCENTIVE PROBLEMS NAMELY. SCHOOLS HAD AN INCENTIVE TO IDENTIFY STUDENTS WITH WHICHEVER DISABILITY. WAS ASSOCIATED WITH THE BEST FUNDED PROGRAM AS OPPOSED TO WHICHEVER DISABILITY OR PROGRAM BEST SUITED THEIR INDIVIDUAL NEEDS. TO ADDRESS THESE PROBLEMS THE STATE INTRODUCED A SOMEWHAT SIMPLIFIED SYSTEM STARTING IN NINETEEN EIGHTY. THIS IS COMMONLY KNOWN AS THE J. FIFTY SYSTEM AFTER THE COMPLIANCE DOCUMENT THOSE ASSOCIATED WITH IT. THE SYSTEM BASICALLY SAID INSTEAD OF HAVING A DISABILITY SPECIFIC TYPE REGIME WE'RE GOING TO FIND BASED ON THE GENERAL TYPE OF SERVICES THAT SINCE RECEIVED. SO UNDER THIS SYSTEM SCHOOLS RECEIVED ONE RATE FOR SERVING STUDENTS IN A SPECIAL DAY CLASS ANOTHER RATE FOR SERVING. STUDENTS IN A MAINSTREAM ENVIRONMENT. ANOTHER IMPORTANT CHANGE THAT WAS MADE AT THIS TIME WAS THAT THE STATE DEVELOPED. A SPECIAL EDUCATION LOCAL PLANNING AREAS FOR CELL PHONES. NOW THAT SELL THE MODEL STILL EXISTS EVEN THOUGH WE NO LONGER HAVE THE J. FIFTY MODEL. CALIFORNIA HAS ABOUT A HUNDRED FORTY OF THE SELFLESS THEY TEND TO FALL IN THREE GENERAL CATEGORIES. THE MOST COMMON IS A CELL BUT THAT REPRESENTS A COLLABORATION BETWEEN A JOINING SMALL AND MID SIZED DISTRICTS. CHARTER SCHOOLS IN COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION. AND THESE ENTITIES WORK COLLABORATIVELY ON PROVIDING SPECIAL EDUCATION TO ALL STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES AND THAT SERVICE AREA. AT SOME SOAP IS A REPRESENT A SINGLE LARGE DISTRICTS SO DISTRICTS SUCH AS LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SAN DIEGO UNIFIED SERVICE OUR OWN SYLLABLES. IN THE FINAL CATEGORY OF SELFLESS SERVICE ONLY CHARTER SCHOOLS AND THIS IS. CATEGORY IS DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHER CATEGORIES IN THAT IT IS NOT RESTRICTED TO A SPECIFIC GEOGRAPHIC AREA SO. IN SOME CASES THE TRUTH THESE CHARTER SELFLESS INCLUDE MEMBERS FROM NOW. UNDER THE SIMPLIFIED. J. FIFTY SYSTEM THAT WAS ESTABLISHED THE SAME TIME WE START WITH SOAP WAS. IN THIS STATE AGAIN IDENTIFIED SOME PROBLEMS WITH THE SYSTEM AGAIN AND IT WAS QUITE COMPLICATED FOR. SUPPOSED TO FILL OUT THE AND MASTER THE ASSOCIATED COMPLIANCE DOCUMENTS THEY CAN THEY WERE SENT INCENTIVE CONCERNS AND IN PARTICULAR. THERE IS A CONCERN THAT. BASED ON THE FUNDING RATES PROVIDED A SCHOOLS HAD AN INCENTIVE TO A SERV SPECIFICALLY STUDENTS WITH SEVERE DISABILITIES AND A SPECIAL DAY CLASS ENVIRONMENT WHERE THE FUNDING RELIEF. MORE CLOSELY MATCH THE COST OF PROVIDING THOSE SERVICES AS OPPOSED TO SERVING THEM IN A MAINSTREAM ENVIRONMENT WHERE THE FUNDING WAS NOT SUFFICIENT. TO ADDRESS THOSE INCENTIVE PROBLEMS AND ALSO TO. ADDRESS THE COMPLEXITY THE STATE INTRODUCED ITS CURRENT SYSTEM. IN NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT THAT SCRIBED ON PAGE FOUR. SINCE SYSTEM IS COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS A P. SIX OR TWO AND IT'S IT'S BASED PRIMARILY ON ONE FACTOR WHICH IS OVERALL STUDENT ATTENDANCE. SO AGAIN FUNDING IS DISTRIBUTED TO SELL PLAYERS UNDER THIS SYSTEM. IS DISTRIBUTED BASED ON THE TOTAL NUMBER OF STUDENTS THAN HE'D SELL. SERVICE REGARDLESS OF HOW MANY OF THE STUDENTS. HAVE DISABILITIES OR WHAT. SPECIFIC SERVICES THOSE STUDENTS RECEIVE. US. AND ONCE A SUB OF RECEIVES THE TOTAL FUNDING AMOUNT THE SOAP THAT MAKES A DECISION ABOUT HOW TO ALLOCATE THAT FUNDING BETWEEN ITS INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS. SO THE EIGHTY SIX TO TWO HAS ACHIEVED MANY OF ITS INITIAL PROP. POLICY GOALS IS MUCH SIMPLER THAN THE SYSTEM THEY REPLACED. AND ALSO UNDER AB SIXTY TWO WE'VE SEEN A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS WITH SEVERE DISABILITIES WHO ARE SERVED IN MAINSTREAM ENVIRONMENTS. IT'S APPROXIMATELY DOUBLED FROM ABOUT FIFTEEN PERCENT THE YEAR BEFORE EIGHTY SIX A TWO TO ABOUT THIRTY PERCENT IN THE MOST RECENT DATA. HOWEVER THERE ARE SEVERAL CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN SHARED ABOUT THE BASICS OF TO MODEL AND WE OUTLINED THOSE CONCERNS OR SOME OF THEM ON THE LAST TWO PAGES OF THE HANDOUT. SO THE FIRST IS THAT. THE SPECIFIC RATES THAT ARE GENERATED UNDER EIGHTY SIX TO TWO VERY QUITE NOTABLY BETWEEN SELFLESS THROUGHOUT THE STATE THIS IS BECAUSE WE. WE. GRANDFATHERED IN. A LOT OF THE INEQUITIES THAT EXISTED IN THE PREVIOUS FNDING MODEL WHEN WE. INITIALLY SET UP THE EIGHTY SIX A TO MODEL. CONSEQUENTLY IN THE MOST RECENT YEAR. STUDENT RATES RANGED FROM LESS THAN A FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR THE LOWEST FUNDED SUPPLEMENTS HAVE MORE THAN NINE HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR. THE HIGHEST FUNDING SOMETHING. TWO. MODEL IS THAT THE UNDERLYING ASSUMPTION HERE IS THAT OVERALL STUDENT ATTENDANCE IS A GOOD PROXY FOR SPCIAL EDUCATION COSTS THE IDEA BEYOND THAT. LARGER DISTRICTS WILL IDENTIFY MORE STUDENTS AND THUS HAVE. MORE SPECIAL EDUCATION COSTS THAN SMALLER. DISTRICTS. WE DO NO EMPIRICALLY THAT THAT ASSUMPTION IS NOT TRUE THAT IN IN FACT THE. IDENTIFICATION RATE FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION VARIES QUITE NOTABLY THROUGHOUT THE STATE SOME SELFLESS IDENTIFY LESS THAN TEN PERCENT OF THEIR STUDENTS FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION. OTHERS IDENTIFY NEARLY TWENTY PERCENT. THESE RATES AT VERY FROM MANY REASONS BOTH. THE UNDERLYING INCIDENCE OF DISABILITIES FAIRIES A GEOGRAPHICALLY AND ALSO PRACTICES AND. INVOLVING HOW STUDENTS ARE IDENTIFIED AND DETERMINED TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION VERY THROUGHOUT THE STATE. BUT ANOTHER CONCERN IS THAT SPECIAL EDUCATION COSTS RISING MUCH FASTER THAN TOTAL FUNDING UNDER EIGHTY SIX TO TWO. IN FACT IN MOST RECENT YEARS MOST AREAS OF THE STATE HAVE EXPERIENCED ON THE ONE HAND DECREASING THEIR TOTAL STUDENT ATTENDANCE WHICH MEANS THAT THEIR TOTAL FUNDING UNDER EIGHTY SIX OR TWO HAS BEEN GOING DOWN. WHAT THE SAME TIME IN THE THEY'RE EXPERIENCING AN INCREASE IN THE SPECIAL EDUCATION POPULATION? TAKER LISTED AS BEEN DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE. IN THE POPULATION OF STUDENTS IDENTIFIED WITH AUTISM. CONSEQUENTLY WE'VE SEEN THAT SHARE OF SPECIAL EDUCATION COSTS THAT ARE COVERED BY LOCAL GENERAL PURPOSE FINDING. EXPAND QUITE NOTABLY IN THE LAST COUPLE YEARS. ON THE LAST PAGE READ UNTIL WITH ONE FINAL CONCERN WITH EIGHTY SIX TO TWO MODEL WHICH IS THAT IT DOES NOT EXPLICITLY COVER. OF THE POPULATION OF PRE SCHOOL AGE CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES.NOW AB SIX OH TWO IS BASED ON ATTENDANCE AND KINDERGARTEN THROUGH GRADE TWELVE BUT UNDER FEDERAL AND STATE LAW SCHOOLS ARE STILL REQUIRED TO OFFER SPECIAL EDUCATION STUDENTS. AND CHILDREN WHO HAVE DISABILITIES WHO ARE AGE THREE AND FOUR. OF THIS POPULATION OF CHILDREN WHO ARE THREE AND FOUR YEARS OLD WITH DISABILITIES HAVE GROWN QUITE NOTABLY IN RECENT YEARS. BUT EIGHTY SIX OF TWO DOES NOT RECOGNIZE THAT GROWTH IN THIS. THOSE DISTRICTS HAVE NOT SEEN ANY CORRESPONDING INCREASE IN OVERALL FUNDING. THAT'S THE END OF MY PREPARED REMARKS BUT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU HAS CENTER MORE LIKE. AND ASK QUESTIONS. YES WITH INCEST. POSER CAME ON TIME ABSOLUTELY. THANK YOU RICHARD. YES AND WHAT AGE FIVE. WEEK WE HAVE THE SPECIAL EDUCATION PER STUDENT EXPENDITURES OF REASON. FASTER THAN FINDING CAN YOU GO ONLY UP TO FIFTEEN SIXTEEN SO. HOW MUCH IS PROB NINETY EIGHT FINDING RISEN SINCE THAT TIME? IT'S ABOUT NINE BILLION OR TEN BILLION. I'M I'M AFRAID I DON'T HAVE TO HAVE OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD YOU ARE RIGHT THAT. SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN AND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN WERE BOTH PRETTY POSITIVE YEARS FOR PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT I. EXPECT ONCE WE GET THE SPECIAL EDUCATION EXPENDITURE DATA WILL WILL STILL SEE THAT. THOSE EXPENDITURES HAVE INCREASED AT LEAST AT THE SAME RATE AS PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT IS INCREASED. SO YOU WOULD THINK THAT THE THE TWELVE PERCENT TWO PERCENT WOULD STILL BE THE SAME. AT THE DIFFERENCE MAY VERY WELL BE SIMILAR YEAH. AND THEN. DO YOU HAVE ANY STATISTICS ON. KERN SAID JUST DROP OUT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM WHEN YOUR KIDS HAVE. DISABILITIES TO EAT DO WE HAVE ANY DATA. AND NO WE DON'T HAVE ANY DATE ON THAT. IT IS AN INTERESTING. ARYAN SPECIAL EDUCATION LAW BECAUSE EVEN STUDENTS THAT IT THATCHOOSE TO ATTEND PRIVATE SCHOOLS ARE STILL ENTITLED TO SPECIAL EDUCATION SERVICES THEY'RE FUNDED THROUGH THE PUBLIC SCHOOL DISTRICT. SO IT'S IT'S. OF LIKELY THAT FEW STUDENTS ARE OPTING OUT ENTIRELY OF PUBLIC SPECIAL EDUCATION. DO WE HAVE. DO WE KNOW HOW MANY OF THE STUDENTS THAT PARTICIPATE ARE. ATTENDING PRIVATE SCHOOLS. BUT AS FAR AS I KNOW WE DON'T WE DON'T TRACK THAT KATE. WE KNOW THAT WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER THEY'RE GETTING. HIGH PRIORITY SERVICE OR NOT IF THEY'RE NOT ATTENDING PUBLIC SCHOOLS. AND AS FAR AS I KNOW WE HAVE NO DATA SPECIFICALLY IN THE POPULATION. DO WE KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT. PRIVATE SCHOOLS THAT ARE FOCUSED JUST ON CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES. YET THERE IS A CATEGORY OF SCHOOLS WHICH SOMEONE BUT CONFUSINGLY IS. REFERRED TO AS NON PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND THESE ARE ENTITIES THAT. EXIST SPECIFICALLY TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES UNDER CONTRACT WITH PUBLIC SCHOOLS. THERE ARE A LOT OF THESE THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND THEY THEY PERFORM AN IMPORTANT FUNCTION AND SPECIAL EDUCATION TYPICALLY THEY THEY PROVIDE. VERY SPECIALIZED SERVICES TO STUDENTS WITH VERY SEVERE NEEDS. AND SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT A LOT OF THOSE SCHOOLS RECEIVE. PUBLIC FUNDING AS A LIKE A CONTRACT SERVICE MEDIA IN MOST CASES THAT MAKES UP THE MAJORITY OR ALL OF. THE NON PUBLIC SCHOOL REVENUES IS A CONTRACT WITH THE PUBLIC SCHOOL AND DO WE KNOW OF ANY SCHOOLS THAT TAKE NO GOVERNMENT MONEY THEN. I'M NOT AWARE OF ANY. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. SIR. THANK YOU THAT AFTER A FEW QUESTIONS BOTH FOR DISTANCE SOME SOME COMMENTARY FIRST. I DO SHARE THE POINT YOU MAKE ABOUT EQUALIZING AND IT'S ROUGHLY THREE HUNDREDMILLION I THINK THAT. IT'S YOU KNOW UNFAIR IF YOU LOOK AT THE CHART SOME. DISTRICTS IN CALIFORNIA AND HAVE. A REIMBURSEMENT RATE ESSENTIALLY YOU KNOW THIRTY FORTY FIFTY PERCENT GREATER. AND SO I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD ADDRESS AND ALSO TO NOTE THAT SINCE. THIS IS KIND OF A LEGACY CATEGORICAL IF YOU LOOK AT THE GROWTH IN LC AFFECT THE LAST FEW YEARS. AT HUGE INCREASES BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE STATUTORY COLA. MINIMAL SO. IT COMPOUNDS THAT. THAT INEQUITY GOING FORWARD AND THAT I DIDN'T WANT TO GO BACK TO THE TO THE CHART YOU HAD A NUMBER ONE AS FAR AS THE THE COMMON. TYPES OF STUDENTS AS FAR AS THAT DISABILITIES AND IN THIS UP STRUCK ME FOR A COUPLE REASONS ONE. I WAS A LITTLE KID WAS IN A SPEECH CLASS I HAD AT. THE ALL STAR STUTTERING ISSUE AND SPENT THAT FROM KINDERGARTEN THROUGH FOURTH GRADE BEING PULLED OUT GOING TO THAT. SPEECH THERAPISTS AND SENSE IT WORKED UP TO FOURTH GRADE SO WHAT IT SHOWS HERE IS ESSENTIALLY. MY LIFE. BUT BUT I I WONDER IF YOU SEE THE HUGE HUGE GROWTH IN THE LEARNING DISORDER POPULATION. AND. AND HOW IS THAT CHANGED OVER YEARS AND AND ARE THERE ANY. PROMISING TRENDS TO TO START EARLIER BECAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE IT IN THE DISORDER PEACE IF YOU LOOK AT GRADES K. THROUGH. TWO WE DON'T SPEND A LOT OF MONEY WE SPEND A TON OF MONEY FROM GRADES THREE THROUGH TWELVE SO WHAT DO WE DO AS FAR AS. DOING EARLIER INTERVENTION I KNOW THAT. CERTAINLY A PRE K. IS A PRETTY PROMISING. THAT BASICALLY REMEDY AND SHOWS THAT KIDS GET A QUALITY. PRE K. ENVIRONMENT YOU CAN LESSON THAT THE TRACK FOR SPECIAL ED DOWN THE ROAD SO MAYBE CAN ENLIGHTEN US THERE. YEAH THE IT IS AN INTERESTING STORY WITH SPECIFIC LEARNING DISORDERS WHAT OFTEN HAPPENS IS THAT IT'S DIFFICULT TO. DIAGNOSE A SPECIFIC WARNING DISORDER INTEL ITSELF HAS BEEN EXPOSED TO RELATIVELY. HIGH LEVEL CURRICULUM BUT A LOT OF THESE DISORDERS ARE SPECIFIC TO. THE CHILD HAS DIFFICULTY LEARNING HOW TO READ OR LEARNING HOW TO DO MATH AND SO. OFTENTIMES THESE GO UNDIAGNOSED AND TELL THE LATER GRADE SPECIFICALLY FOR THAT REASON. IN SOME CASES A CHILD IS IDENTIFIED AS NEEDING SPECIAL SUPPORT BEFORE HAND AND THEY JUST DON'T HAVETHE NAME FOR IT YET. SO SOME OF THESE CHILDREN ARE LABELED AS HAVING A DIFFERENT DISABILITY AND EARLIER GRADES AND AND THAT WOULD SPEAK TO WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF. EARLY IDENTIFICATION. IMAGES LATER ON THAT. IT IS DISCOVERED THAT THE APPROPRIATE NAME FOR THE DISORDER IS FOR INSTANCE DYSLEXIA. OF COURSE THE LAST DECADE OR SO WE'RE HEARING MORE AS FAR AS. THAT ADHD AND TO AND THOSE ISSUES OR WHAT CAN YOU TELL US AS FAR AS THE. THE TRENDS DISABILITY GROUPS AS FAR AS WHICH ONES ARE GROWING WHICH ONES ARE ARE DECLINING. WHETHER THAT FISCAL IMPLICATIONS FOR THESE. YEAH THE. A VERY BRIEF SYNOPSIS IS THAT. THE RELATIVELY MILD DISABILITIES THAT ARE CALLED OUT HERE SO SPEECH IMPAIRMENTS AND LEARNING DISORDERS HAVE BEEN ABOUT FLAT FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AN INFECTED DECLINED A LITTLE OVER THE LAST. TEN YEARS WHERE IS THE INCIDENCE OF ALL OTHER DISABILITIES HAS INCREASED AND FOR THE MOST PART THAT INCREASES BEEN DRIVEN BY A SINGLE CATEGORY WHICH IS AUTISM. THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA WHO ARE DIAGNOSED WITH AUTISM. AS I I BELIEVE ABOUT TRIPLED OVER THE LAST. TEN OR FIFTEEN YEARS IT'S BEEN. A. SIGNIFICANT ENOUGH THAT BY ITSELF THE CATEGORY OF AUTISM ACCOUNTS FOR MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED PERCENT OF THE GROWTH IN THIS SPECIAL EDUCATION POPULATION OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS. OKAY. AT FISCAL EVEN ASKED ABOUT THAT. THE STUDENTS WHO HAVE AUTISM TEND TO REQUIRE RELATIVELY SEVERE. INTENSIVE SUPPORTS. THOSE INCLUDE ONE ON ONE PAIR PROFESSIONAL AIDS A SPEECH THERAPIST PHYSICAL THERAPIST. IF YOU LOOK AT. EMPLOYMENT IN THOSE SPECIFIC AREAS OF THE LAST TEN YEARS IN CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS THEY'VE INCREASED BY ABOUT TWENTY PERCENT ACROSS THE BOARD. THAT'S CERTAINLY REFLECTED IN THE EXPENDITURE AREA AND HAS BEEN A SIGNIFICANT COST DRIVER FOR THOSE DISTRICTS BUT IT'S PROBABLE THAT BEFORE THE INCREASE IN AUTISM THE SAME TYPE OF STUDENTS WERE. CATEGORIZED IN. GENERAL. DISORDER AND NOT NECESSARILY. CATEGORIES AUTISM BUT THEY WERE RECEIVING SPECIAL ED SERVICES. YOU KNOW IT'S A GOOD QUESTION I THINK THE UNDERLYING QUESTION IS WHY HAS THE INCIDENCE OF AUTISM BEEN INCREASING DOES THIS. REPRESENTS AN ACTUAL INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF OF STUDENTS WHO HAVE AUTISM UP PER SE OR DOES IT. REPRESENT A CHANGE IN HOW WE ARE IDENTIFYING AND DIAGNOSING. AUTISM SUCH THAT. STUDENTS WHO USED TO BE IDENTIFIED WITH SOMETHING ELSE ARE NOW CLASSIFIED AS AUTISM. RESEARCH REALLY HAS NOT. A SOLIDIFIED AROUND A SINGLE ANSWER ONE ONE THING TO NOTE IS THAT THIS RECENT TREND IN AUTISM IS NOT UNIQUE TO CALIFORNIA IN FACT IS NOT UNIQUE TO THE UNITED STATES. MOST HIGH INCOME COUNTRIES HAVE SEEN THE SAME SIGNIFICANT INCREASE OVER A NUMBER OF YEARS AND RESEARCHERS WHILE THEY'VE SPENT A LOT OF TIME ON THIS ISSUE. STILL APPEAR TO BE SET. UP IT STOPPED. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR A COUPLE QUESTIONS. UNDER THE FEDERAL ID HE A. THE FEDERAL COMMITMENT TO SPECIAL EDUCATION SUPPOSED TO BE FORTY PERCENT AND WERE HOVERING AROUND SIXTEEN PERCENT. I'D LIKE TO KNOW IF WE WERE FULLY FUNDED WHAT WOULD THAT MEAN IN TERMS OF. AGGREGATE DOLLARS AS WELL AS PERCENTAGE. YES SIR I I BELIEVE IN. IN THE MOST RECENT DATA THAT I HAVE AVAILABLE IS FROM A FIFTEEN SIXTEEN AT THAT TIME. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PROVIDED CALIFORNIA A LITTLE OVER A BILLION DOLLARS FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION COSTS THAT REPRESENTED. A LITTLE LESS THAN TEN PERCENT OF. OF TOTAL SPECIAL EDUCATION EXPENDITURES IN THE STATES SO ROUGHLY SPEAKING WE'D BE TALKING ABOUT AN INCREASE ALONG THE LINES OF THREE OR FOUR BILLION DOLLARS AND FEDERAL SPECIAL EDUCATION. AID IN ORDER TO GET THE THE FORTY PERCENT. THAT BE A BIG DIFFERENCE WHEN IT. I BELIEVE. MANY MANY SCHOOLS WOULD BE HAPPY TO SEE THAT INCREASE YES THAT'S A CIVIL RIGHTS ISSUE. I. I. DON'T. FEEL COMFORTABLE SPEAKING ASIDE A LOT AND I WILL THEN IT IT IS THAT OKAY YEAH I'M. QUICK QUESTION QUESTION NUMBER TWO YOU WERE SAYING HOW IT DOES TO POPULATIONS LIKE HOVERING SOMEWHERE BETWEEN TEN TO TWENTY PERCENT. SO SOME. ARE THERE SOME SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT ARE MORE AGGRESSIVE IN TERMS OF TRYING TO IDENTIFY STUDENTS SIR AS HAVING SOMEONE I ONE OF MYCHILDREN WAS SPECIAL NEEDS. AND IT'S A VERY IF YOU'RE NOT SOPHISTICATED TO NAVIGATE THAT PROCESS IS VERY DIFFICULT SO I WONDER IF THERE'S A DISPARITY AMONG. LIKE SCHOOL DISTRICT EDGES. AT. SOCIAL ECONOMIC LEVEL SO PEOPLE WHO MAYBE OR ARE. DISADVANTAGE ECONOMICALLY DON'T HAVE THOSE TOOLS TO NAVIGATE THE SYSTEM IS THERE ANY ANY DATA ON THAT ONE WAY OR THE OTHER. WE WE CERTAINLY BELIEVE THAT ONE RESENT THE INCIDENCE OF STUDENTS IN SPECIAL EDUCATION FAIRIES IS THAT. INDIVIDUAL SCHOOL LEVEL POLICIES FAIRY AND DOES MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE IN IDENTIFICATION BUT IT'S VERY HARD TO DISENTANGLE THAT FROM THIS OTHER QUESTION OF DOES THE UNDERLYING INCIDENCE OF DISABILITIES FAIRY I'M I'M NOT. AWARE OF ANY STUDIES THAT SPECIFICALLY ATTEMPT TO DISENTANGLE THOSE TWO. WHAT ABOUT IT HELD? AT WHAT ABOUT THERE HURDLES FOR PARENTS IN AT TWO NAVIGATE THE SYSTEM. IT'S CERTAINLY. IT IN MANY CASES A VERY DIFFICULT SYSTEM FOR PARENTS TO. SAID NAVIGATE PARENTS OF COURSE. OFTEN COME IN WITH NO EXPERTISE ARE FAMILIAR. WITH THIS. WITH THIS AREA AND AS I THINK YOU'LL LEARN FROM SUBSEQUENT PANELISTS EVEN. TEACHERS AND ADMINISTRATORS HAVE DEATH DECADES OF EXPERTISE STILL GET TRIPPED UP. SO I I THINK THAT CERTAINLY IN AN ISSUE IS SOMETHING THAT. THAT HAS BEEN A LONG STANDING ISSUE IN SPECIAL EDUCATION RIGHT THANK THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU. ACTUALLY WILL FOLLOW UP ON SOME KIND OF CEREBRAL FAVE COURSE I'VE BEEN ON THE AND AS A. PHYSICIAN AND PEDIATRICIAN WHO TAKES CARE OF CHILDREN WHO HAVE. DISABILITIES. WITH PARTICULAR FOCUS ACTION CHILDREN'S LEARNING DISABILITIES AND HEROES USE. AND. I'VE. SOMETIMES THERE ARE THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES FOR FAMILIES AND TRYING TO GET SPECIAL EDUCATION NOW. ACCORDING TO A FEDERAL LAW THAT ID A. SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE REQUIRED. TO PROVIDE. THE SPECIAL EDUCATION SERVICES BUT THERE CAN BE MANY BARRIERS IN FRONT OF FACT. KIND OF WE'VE LOOKED AT. RACIAL DISPARITY SOCIO ECONOMIC DISPARITIES. AND TERMS OF. PEOPLE TRYING TO GET IN CHILDREN AND FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION AND RECEIVE SPECIAL EDUCATION SERVICES I MEAN THEY WOULD ALSO NEED TO BE ADJUSTED FOR AN INDEPENDENT EVALUATION OF. THOSE. CONDITIONS. BUT. SO I THINK THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT DEFINITELY NEEDS TO BE LOOKED AT. THE OTHER QUESTION I GUESS YEAH YOU. AND YOU HAVE YOUR REPORT EARLIER REPORTED FIGURE TO ON SPECIAL EDUCATION SERVICE SCRIPTS AND A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT. CONDITIONS. YOU KNOW THE WAY WE'RE DOING THE FINANCING IS BASED JUST ON ATTENDANCE. RIGHT. AND. SO BUT. DEPENDING ON WHAT CONDITIONS THEY HAVE. THERE MAY BE DIFFERENT BECAUSE YOU JUST REFERRED TO AUTISM BEING VERY INTENSIVE RIGHT. YOU MAY HAVE A SPEECH DELAY WHICH SPEECH THERAPIST YOU CAN HAVE LOTS OF THE YOU CAN HAVE SUCH CHILD WHO HAS SIGNIFICANT. MENTAL HEALTH PHYSICAL HEALTH PROBLEMS. YEAH I KIND OF THE WAY IT'S ALAN MOTION SERVANTS OF FORCE SO HOW DO YOU JUST FOR THAT DURATION FACT ACTUALLY LANCE YOUR QUESTION THEN IS IS THAT. THE MOST EXPENSIVE TWENTY PERCENT. OF OF KIDS WHAT PROPORTION SPECIAL EDUCATION FUNDING ACTUALLY GOES TO THE MOST EXPENSIVE TEN PERCENT MOST BEST OF TWENTY PERCENT. OF SPECIAL EDUCATION THIS EXPENDITURE. YES SIR THE THE FIRST ISSUE THAT YOU RAISED A SON RACIAL DISPARITIES THIS IS A LONG STANDING. ISSUE IN SPECIAL EDUCATION THE THE. THE. A SHORT DESCRIPTION IS THAT. GENERALLY SPEAKING AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS TEND TO BE OVER IDENTIFIED. OF RELATIVE TO THEIR SHARE OF THE POPULATION IN SPECIAL EDUCATION AND ASIAN AMERICAN STUDENTS TEND TO BE UNDER IDENTIFIED. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. MONITORS SINCE THE MOST RECENT. REAUTHORIZATION OF THE INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES EDUCATION ACT BUT A REMAINS AN ONGOING CONCERN. ABOUT THAT AND THE QUESTION ON. ACTUALLY I THINK WE WILL BE CAREFUL I MEAN I RELEASE IT TERM UNDER AND OVER DATA SIDE I CAN BE. THAT TYPE OF LANGUAGE COULD BE MISINTERPRETED. DYING THAT WE HAVE PEOPLE ARE REFERRED TO ACTUALLY DON'T NEED IT ARE PEOPLE SO I I I I. MEAN ALL WE CARE I KNOW THAT'S NOT YOUR INTENSIFIED CAREFUL HOW YOU KNOW I I APPRECIATE THE CLARIFICATION YEAH SO. I I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THE SECOND PART OF WHAT I SAID RELATIVE TO THEIR SHARE OF THE POPULATION SO. IF EXAMPLE. TWO PERCENT OF THE OVERALL STUDENT POPULATION IS I IDENTIFIED AS HAVING AUTISM. BITES OF ONE PERCENT OF THE ASIAN AMERICAN POPULATION OR THREE PERCENT OF THE AFRICAN AMERICAN POPULATION THAT THAT WOULD BE. OF WHAT I'D BE REFERRING TO IS UNDER OVER REPRESENTATIVE BUT THAT IN ITSELF DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THERE'S A PROBLEM BECAUSE I POSSIBLE I WOULD NOT USE ARTISAN IS EXAMPLE BUT YES WE UNDERDOG MISS AUTISM AND THE AFRICAN AMERICAN AND LATINO COMMUNITY. SELL ME SOME OTHER EXAMPLES FOR HALF SURE SURE. YEAH I DID YOU ACTUALLY AT THAT. DID YOU ACTUALLY LOOK AT THE DATA ON AUTISM THAT I KNOW NOTICED AND NIGHT YEAH YEAH. TO MAKE THE OTHER OTHER REFERRALS FOR SPECIAL ADS WHERE WE'RE SEEING THIS PHENOMENON IS DESCRIBING ANSWER THAT'S NOT AROUND AUTISM'S I REALIZE YOU PRACTICE PICKING EXAMPLE TALK YEAH. I APPRECIATE THE CLARIFICATION. THE SECOND QUESTION ABOUT. ADJUSTMENTS UNDER THE STATE'S FUNDING A MODEL FOR A SPECIFIC TYPES OF DISABILITIES AND FOR THE MOST PART THE STATE DOESN'T DO THIS. THERE ARE A FEW EXAMPLES. FOR EXAMPLE. THE STATE DOES PROVIDE SOME SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING FOR STUDENTS WITH WHAT ARE REFERRED TO AS A LOW INCIDENCE DISABILITIES THIS IS A CATEGORY INCLUDING. A STUDENTS WERE DEAF AND HARD OF HEARING THOSE WHO ARE BLIND OR VISUALLY IMPAIRED AND THOSE WHO ARE ORTHOPEDIC CLEAN PAIRED. EACH OF THOSE STUDENTS. GENERATE SOME SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING BUT THAT THIS IS A VERY MODEST. I BELIEVE IN THE MOST RECENT YEAR ADEQUATELY TO ABOUT. FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS FOR. EACH STUDENT THESE STUDENTS TEND TO REQUIRE. TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS OF ADDITIONAL SUPPORT SERVICES IN THIS ADJUSTMENT AS. IT IS NOT PARTICULARLY NOTABLE OF FOR THE MOST PART HOWEVER FUNDING IS BASED ON TOTAL STUDENT ATTENDANCE WAS MEANS THAT WE ARE NOT ADJUSTING EITHER FOR THE OVERALL INCIDENCE OF DISABILITIES. OR THE INCIDENCE OF SPECIFIC DISABILITIES AND AS YOU KNOW. THAT. HAS SIGNIFICANT FISCAL IMPACTS CERTAIN DISABILITIES REQUIRE MUCH MORE INTENSIVE SUPPORTS. AND IF A SCHOOL DISTRICT PARTICULARLY A SMALL SCHOOL DISTRICT HAPPENS TO HAVE. AN UNUSUALLY HIGH INCIDENCE OF STUDENTS WITH OF RELATIVELY SEVERE DISABILITIES I CAN HAVE SIGNIFICANT FISCAL IMPACTS. ON THE OTHER HAND RESEARCH DOES INDICATE THAT WHEN. GOVERNMENTS PROVIDE SPECIAL EDUCATION FUNDING BASED ON THE SPECIFIC INCIDENTS OF DISABILITY IS. A SCHOOLS DO END UP IDENTIFYING MORE STUDENTS FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION THEY DO RESPOND TO THAT OF FISCAL INCENTIVES. AND THEY CAN HAVE NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON AN INDIVIDUAL STUDENTS ACADEMIC OUTCOMES. BEING CLASSIFIED AS A STUDENT WITH DISABILITIES OFTEN MEANS. BEING FACED WITH LOWERED EXPECTATIONS WILL FOR EXAMPLE WHICH CAN RESULT IN THEIR ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE SUFFERING SO IT IS IT. IS A CAREFUL BALANCE THAT HAS TO BE STRUCK BETWEEN PROVIDING ADEQUATE FISCAL SUPPORT IN ENSURING THAT THERE ARE NO INAPPROPRIATE INCENTIVES. VIOLENT MEN FOLLOW UP ON THAT I MEAN. I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING BUT I THINK IN TERMS OF THAT BUT I I I I FIND IT INTERESTING POLICY APPROACH TO SAY THAT WELL. INSTEAD IF APPROPRIATE FUNDING BASED ON NEED. WHICH YOU KNOW WE WE CAN LOOK AT HOW WE CREATE INCENTIVES ARE JUST INTENSE BUT. THE OTHER BUT. THAT WORD ACTUALLY ALLOW. THIS CERTAIN RATE MAYBE GETTING. US SINCE YOU ACTUALLY NEED SERVICES CROWDED OUT BY SOMEONEELSE BY OTHERS WHO MAY HAVE HIGH DEMANDS. AND AND I THINK WHEN WE TALK ABOUT YOU KNOW SMALL SCHOOL DISTRICT TALK ABOUT SOMEONE IS REALLY EXPENSIVE. OR NOT THAT SIMPLY SAY HIGH INCIDENCE. BY TALKING ONE OR TWO. NOT TALKING ABOUT. SUDDENLY THEY GOT A HUGE NUMBER RATE IN FACT ACTUALLY IS INTERESTING BECAUSE HE POINTED OUT THAT OF THE THREE IS THE THREE THINGS THE STATE ACTUALLY DOESN'T JUST MINUTES ORTHOPEDIC IMPAIRMENT. HE SAID. A NIGHTLINE EXACTLY IMPAIRED RIGHTS AND AND IF YOU ADD THOSE TWO UP ACCORDING TO YOUR CHART. OR THE IMPAIRMENT REPRESENTS POINT TOO AND THAT DEFINITELY LINE REPRESENTS LISTEN POINT OF FIVE SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT STATE JUST MEANT FOR ESSENTIALLY. A FRACTION BUS ABOUT. YOU KNOW LIKE A QUARTER OF A PERCENT OF THE STUDENTS OF THE OF THE TOTAL POPULATION WE CAN RECALCULATED FOR PERCENTAGE OF. THOSE IN SPECIAL ED SO. SO REALLY IT'S I MEAN BIZZARE THEY THEY MAY HAVE. TO NAVIGATE NEEDS AN EXPENSE WISE BUT I THINK IT'S. I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO LOOK AT. WHAT PORTION? WE SHOULD LOOK AT WHAT ARE THE INCENTIVES ARE DISINCENTIVES BUT WHAT PORTION. OF THE NEED IS BECAUSE WHAT'S KNOWN FOR TWO. IF YOU HAVE A SMALL SCHOOL DISTRICT. YOU KNOW YOU'RE FACED WITH NINETEEN THIS IS SOMETHING WE SEE IN HEALTHCARE TO WRITE ITS ADVERSE SELECTION WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT YOU HAVE ONE DAY OFF YOU VERY EXPENSIVE PEOPLE. AND THAT CAN CROWD OUT AND IF YOU'VE GOT JUST GOING TO DO IT BASED ON POPULATION YOU JUST HAVE TO TAKE ACCOUNT OF VARIATION RIGHT SO IF YOU HAVE ONE VERY EXPENSIVE PERSON. ACTING COMPLETELY BLOW OUT YOUR ENTIRE BUDGETS FOR ALL SPECIAL ED IS THE ONLY BEING ON YOUR TOTAL POPULATION. ESTIMATE NOTICE YOU KNOW THE FACT THAT YOU DON'T COUNT THREE AND FOUR YEAR OLDS. ARE THE OTHER THING IS I DO NEED TO. TO TO CLARIFY SOME STATEMENTS YOU MADE BEFORE. I MYSELF AM A HEALTH PROFESSIONAL STUDIES EPIDEMIOLOGY YOUR COMMENTS ABOUT AUTISM AND AUTISM RATES I THINK DOES NOT ACTUALLY FOR LIKE THE CURRENT SCIENCE. THERE'S A GROWING BODY OF RESEARCH SHOWING THAT THE INCREASE IN AUTISM RATES IS DUE TO. OF IDENTITY HELP. DIFFERENCE IN DIAGNOSIS CHANGES IN THE DSM. ACTUALLY AND IT WAS ONLY IN NINETEEN NINETY ONE WHERE TO PARK ADVOCATION YEARS APART EDUCATION ACTUALLY SAID TO. CHILDREN ALSO QUALIFY FOR A SPECIAL EDUCATION AND ACTUALLY SEEING A KANTANA RISING DIAGNOSES. BECAUSE OF THAT. PROBABLY YOU KNOW WE CAN TALK YOU CAN TALK ABOUT DIFFERENT TENANTS ARE THERE'S BEEN RESEARCH DONE FOR EXAMPLE IN ENGLAND. THEY'VE ACTUALLY GONE BACK AND. REASSESS THE SAMPLE POPULATION USING A STANDARDIZED MEASURES LOOK OF CAT TRACTORS AUTISM AND IDENTIFY AND ACTUALLY FOUND OUT THAT THE DOLLS WHO WERE DIAGNOSED WITH AUTISM BEFORE WHEN THEIR CHILDREN X. WE HAD DIFFERENT SECRETARIAT. ACTUALLY HAD THE SAME RATES AS THE CHILDREN SO. BASICALLY EMPHASIZING THAT PROBABLY VEE SAYS PEOPLE ALWAYS HAD AUTISM WE JUST HAD DIFFERENT SETS OF CRITERIA AND THOSE HAVE CHANGED OVER TIME SO YOU GO INTO A STANDARDIZED. DIRECTORY AND THEY WOULD SEND EXAMPLE THE POPULATION AND WE EVALUATE THEM. IT'S YOU KNOW YOU GET THE SAME RATE FOR OLDER PEOPLE THAN A CHILL AS THE CHILDREN SO I THINK THAT. YOU KNOW THAT THAT THE BODY OF RESEARCH IS MOVING IN THAT DIRECTION I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THAT STATEMENT. THAT YOU MADE EARLIER. AND THE CENTER. ACTUALLY FOR THAT DOCTOR. DOCTOR THANK YOU DOCTOR YES. I THINK SO MUCH ON THE INCENTIVE QUESTION. ANOTHER. ISSUE THAT I POTENTIALLY SEE IS THAT. DISTRICTS THAT DO A REALLY GOOD JOB WITH SPECIAL ED WILL TEND TO ATTRACT FAMILIES WITH KIDS WITH SPECIAL NEEDS. BUT THEN THEY'RE NOT REWARDED FOR THAT ACTUALLY ENDS UP STRAINING THEIR BUDGETS AND SO THAT MIGHT REDUCE THE INCENTIVE TO. REALLY PROVIDE EFFECTIVE SERVICE IN THE FIRST PLACE IS THIS I DID ADMIT THAT YOU SEE PLAY OUT. I ATE CERTAINLY SOMETHING WE HEAR ABOUT A LOT A IT'S. A IT'S A DIFFICULT TO QUANTIFY. BUT IT IS A COMMON EXPLANATION FOR WHY THERE IS SO MUCH VARIATION AND THE RATE OF IDENTIFICATION BETWEEN SELFLESS ACTS. DO YOU. HAVE ANY THOUGHTS ON HOW YOU CAN ADDRESS THAT WLL THEN YOU KNOW RUNNING INTO THE OTHER PROBLEM WITH INCENTIVES OF. DEALING WITH CLASSIFICATION. WELL I I THINK THE STATE HAS MANY OPTIONS FOR ALLOCATING FUNDING. BUT EACH ONE WOULD HAVE DISSOCIATED STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES I I MEAN. FOR EXAMPLE WE COULD USE ONE OF THE METHODS THAT HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN USED IN THE STATE EITHER FUNDING BASED ON THE TYPES OF SERVICES THAT ARE OFFERED. OR FUNDING BASED ON THE TYPES OF DISABILITIES SOUND. THOSE EXPERIENCES THAT THE STATE HAD WITH THE SPECIFIC SYSTEMS ARE MIXED BUT PERHAPS WE CAN IMPROVE ON THE SPECIFIC WEAKNESSES OF OF THOSE. ALTERNATIVELY. AT LEAST THEORETICALLY THE STATE COULD. FIND THE SPECIAL EDUCATION ON A REIMBURSEMENT METHOD A FEW STATES USE THAT. THAT RUNS INTO. SEPARATE SET OF CHALLENGES INVOLVING HOW DO YOU HIDE IT. EXPENDITURE CLAIMS BUT. AND IT'S IT'S POTENTIALLY THAT COULD BE WORKED THROUGH I I THINK THE LEGISLATURE WOULD HAVE MANY OPTIONS FOR DEALING WITH. WITH THESE ISSUES IF IF THAT WAS A MAJOR CONCERN YES. YEAH SOME ON PAGE FOR YOU YOUR SECOND BALL IT SORT OF DOES A GOOD JOB OF US IS UNDER THE FUNDING. SYSTEM THE STATE PROVIDES SELF AS WITH FUNDING BASED ON TOTAL STUDENT ATTENDANCE. REGARDLESS OF HOW MANY STUDENTS ARE ENROLLED IN SPECIAL ED. EDUCATION OR HOW THE STUDENTS ARE SERVED. THAT'S SORT OF THE CONCEPT THAT I GET AN EARFUL FROM FROM MY DISTRICT WITH A HIGH CONCENTRATION. OF SPECIAL ED STUDENTS. FINALLY SAYING IT CREATES AN UNFAIR. BURDEN WHERE THEY'RE NOT GETTING COMPENSATED FOR THE ACTUAL NUMBER OF STUDENTS THAT NEED SERVICES. WOULD YOU SAY THAT AB SIX OF TWO IS A GOOD MODEL. WOULD YOU SAY IT'S A SUCCESSFUL MODEL. I. I I THINK THAT THE EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT MAYBE SIX OR TWO SUCCEEDED AT THE STATE'S INITIAL POLICY GOALS WHICH WAS SIMPLIFYING THE SYSTEM AND SPECIFICALLY. ELIMINATING DISINCENTIVES FOR SERVING STUDENTS WITH RELATIVELY SEVERE DISABILITIES AND MAINSTREAM ENVIRONMENTS. NOW WITH ANY POLICY AS BROAD AS. FUNDING SPECIAL EDUCATION THEY'RE ALWAYS GOING TO BE A NUMBER OF COMPETING PRIORITIES. END IN THIS IN THIS INSTANCE IT. ONE AREA WHERE THE STATE MAY BE HAS MOVED AWAY FROM IS. OF BEING LESS PRECISE AND HOW IT TARGETS SPECIAL EDUCATION FUNDING. FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION ME. THAT IS CERTAINLY IN THE AREA. WHERE'D BE LEGITIMATE FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER ARE THERE ALTERNATIVES THAT WOULD IMPROVE UPON IT. OF COURSE ANY OF THOSE IMPROVEMENTS WILL COME WITH THEIR OWN TRADE OFFS. AND THAT ACTUALLY IS TO MY NEXT QUESTION IS THE LA O. RECOMMENDING. ANY SPECIFIC IMPROVEMENTS BASED ON ALL OF YOUR RESEARCH AND DATA. THAT ARE FAIR. WASTED I MEAN IF YOU WERE KING HOW WOULD YOU IMPROVE THE SYSTEM I GUESS IS MY QUESTION. AT THIS AT THIS TIME THE LA OWES. THE ONLY SIGNIFICANT LONG STANDING RECOMMENDATION FOR IMPROVING SPECIAL EDUCATION FUNDING IS TO ADDRESS THE LONG STANDING INEQUITIES IN EIGHTY SIX TO TWO RATES SO FOR MANY YEARS WE'VE BEEN. SUGGESTING THAT THESE INEQUITIES ARE BASED ON. REALLY THAT SOME HISTORICAL ACCIDENTS OR ARTIFACTS THAT DON'T MAKE ANY SENSE ANYMORE AND THAT AND WE SHOULD BE WORKING TOWARDS. AT LEAST REALIZING THE INITIAL VISION OF EIGHTY SIX OR TWO WHICH WOULD BE AN EQUAL PERSON FUNDING RIGHT FOR ALSO THROUGHOUT THE STATE. OKAY THANK YOU. CAN I JUST WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT A LITTLE BIT. I'M ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAS CHANGED SIGNIFICANTLY SINCE NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT. IS. A MUCH GREATER DIVERSITY IN THE TYPE OF SCHOOLS THAT EXIST IN OUR SYSTEM. AND. I WAS WITHOUT THE GROWTH OF THE CHARTER SCHOOL MOVEMENT. WHICH HAS NOW IS NOW TO GETTING UP AT A MUCH MUCH LARGER PORTION OF OUR STUDENTS. AND WHERE DOES THAT FIT INTO THE CALCULUS. THERE ARE LOTS OF RUMORS OF FLOW BACK BACK AND FORTH FROM BOTH SIDES ABOUT THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE DISTRICT SCHOOLS IN THE CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE. TAKING ON A CERTAIN PORTION OF THE SPECIAL NEEDS STUDENTS THERE'S ALSO A LOT OF ARGUMENTS MADE ABOUT THE SEVERITY OF THE NEEDS. ASSOCIATED. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT WITH THIS NEW SHIFT IN THE WAY THAT WE'RE EDUCATING SO MANY OF OUR STUDENTS. THAT THAT ALONE AT ALL GIVES US THE THE NEED TO REALLY EXAMINE THIS ISSUE. OUT WHAT WE WERE DOING TO TO TO REALLY LOOK AT WHETHER A STRAIGHT PER PUPIL. ALLOCATION REALLY MAKE SENSE ANYMORE. IT IS A. AN IMPORTANT QUESTION. BY A THINK THE THE FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE WITH CHARTER SCHOOLS AND SPECIAL EDUCATION IS THAT A LOT OF SPECIAL EDUCATION SERVICES REALLY. DEPEND ON WHAT WE REFER TO AS ECONOMIES OF SCALE. RIGHT IT'S IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO PROVIDE. ADEQUATE SERVICES. FOR A POPULATION OF. WITH REASONABLE COSTS PER STUDENT IF THAT POPULATION IS VERY SMALL SO FOR INSTANCE. OF THE POPULATION WHO ARE BLIND OR VISUALLY IMPAIRED NEED VERY SPECIFIC SUPPORTS AND SERVICES BOTH AND STREETS INSTRUCTIONAL. AND IN TERMS OF THE MATERIALS ARE PROVIDED TO THEM. LARGER SCHOOL DISTRICTS. A SERVICE. I'D JUST BY VIRTUE OF THEIR SIZE MORE OF THE STUDENTS AND THUS HAVE. REASONABLE ACCESS TO THOSE MATERIALS AND ARE ABLE TO EMPLOY A FULL TIME BASIS. APPROPRIATE STAFF MEMBERS SMALLER DID SCHOOL DISTRICTS. OFTEN STRUGGLE WITH THAT AND CHARTER SCHOOLS IN PARTICULAR TO SAY THAT THAT WOULD BE. I THINK THE MAJOR CHALLENGE WITH CHARTER SCHOOLS. FOR THAT REASON I SAY IT'S POSSIBLE TO AN EVEN ABSENT ANY. BAD PRACTICES AMONG CHARTER SCHOOLS THAT PARENTS OF STUDENTS WITH SUCH DISABILITIES COULDN'T EASONABLY. CONCLUDE THAT A CHARTER SCHOOL IS OFTEN NOT THE BEST PLACE FOR THEIR IMPRISONMENT WHICH. BY ITSELFWOULD MEAN THAT THE GROWTH OF THE CHARTER SCHOOL POPULATION. WILL MEAN THAT THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS WHICH HAVE. ADVANTAGES AND ECONOMIES OF SCALE ARE LEFT BEHIND WITH MORE OF THE STUDENTS. THAT. FITS WITH SOME OF THE DATA THAT WE'VE SEEN BUT IT'S IT'S HARD TO. ACTUALLY TEACH OUT A CAUSAL RELATIONSHIP THERE. RIGHT SO I GUESS I'M TRYING TO IN AND THIS IS THE MOMENT I WANT TO ASK THE NEXT PANEL A SUBSIDY SO ANOTHER HERE AND SAID LOVE IT IF THEY WOULD COULD ADDRESS THIS ISSUE BUT. I'M SO INTERESTED IN THIS HISTORICAL SHIFT I APPRECIATE YOUR PRESENTATION. BECAUSE IT SEEMS AS THOUGH THE END OF THE NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT REFORMS THE A B.. SIX OF TO OUR REFORMS. TEAM TO ADDRESS A PROBLEM THAT EXISTED RIGHT THAT THERE WAS A THERE WAS AN INCENTIVE ASSOCIATED WITH. WITH. YOU KNOW OVERDIAGNOSIS PERHAPS. MORE SEVERE NEEDS BECAUSE EVERYONE KNEW THEY GET MORE MONEY ASSOCIATED WITH THAT. ADEN BUT NOW GIVEN THAT THE SHIFT IN THE WAY THEY WERE EDUCATING OUR KIDS IN THE IN THE IN THE MIX OF SCHOOLS THAT ARE THERE OPEN TO THEM AS OPTIONS. AND. I WON IT I I GUESS I GUESS THE QUESTION IS IF WE'RE GONNA IF WE WANT TO. REFORM MAYBE SIX OH TWO TO MOVE A LITTLE BIT BACK IN THE DIRECTION OF WHAT WE HAD BEFORE NINETY EIGHT. AND HOW WOULD WE CRAFT LEGISLATION TO. TO NOT FALL INTO THE SAME PROBLEMS THAT THEY WERE TRYING TO FIX WITH SIX OF TWO IT MAY BE AND THAT'S A BIG QUESTION. AND. IF YOU DON'T HAVE A GREAT ANSWER FOR NOW I'D LOVE THE ALIENS ARE THINKING ABOUT THIS. YEAH WE'RE WE'RE HAPPY TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE ON THIS AND IN FACT WE HAVE BEEN. WORKING. WITH MANY OF. YOUR STAFFERS ON EXACTLY THIS QUESTION FOR MANY YEARS AND. AND HAVE MANY THOUGHTS TO SHARE I'M AFRAID IT'S IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO SUMMARIZE THEM. IN MY COMMENTS HERE DECIDE TO GET THAT I LOVE TO. CONNECT WITH YOU OFF LINE AND TALK ABOUT THIS BECAUSE I'M VERY INTERESTED IN AND CERTAINLY INTERESTING HEARING AS OTHER PALACE COME UP THROUGH THE COURSE OF THE DAY. IF YOU HAVE THOUGHTS ON THAT ISSUE. ASSUME OR CITY THANK YOU. FROM. WHAT IS THE CURRENT TOTAL STATE SPENDING ON SPECIAL EDUCATION? I DON'T HAVE. OBVIOUSLY THE SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN. YEAR WHICH STILL IN PROGRESS I ALSO HAVE NOT HAD A CHANCE TO ANALYZE THE SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN DATA THAT JUST CAME OUT SO. THE MOST RECENT DATA I HAVE IS FROM FIFTEEN SIXTEEN AND THAT YEAR WAS A LITTLE OVER THIRTEEN BILLION DOLLARS THIRTEEN BILLION. AND SO. IT AND AND THAT IS PRIMARILY THROUGH THE STATE ALLOCATION OF FUNDS THAT. INOTES ACTUALLY THE MAJORITY OF IT IS COVERED BY LOCAL GENERAL PURPOSE. IS CONTRIBUTIONS SO THAT THE STATE. ALLOCATION WAS ALL A LITTLE LESS THAN FOUR BILLION DOLLARS SO IT COVERED A LITTLE LESS THAN FORTY PERCENT OF THOSE EXPENDITURES. AND SO DID THE NEWS. DOES THAT MEAN THAT DOLLARS THAT THE STATE GETS THROUGH. THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FOR MY THROUGH PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT. THAT ARE ADMINISTERED BY OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT'S CORRECT. AND SO YOU MENTIONED EARLIER THAT. THAT. UNDER THE FEDERAL ID A. ACTUALLY I THINK IT WAS CENTER WELL THAT THAT THAT INDICATED THAT IT. IS IT IN THE LAW OF THE FEDERAL ID A THAT THE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS SUPPOSED TO FIND IT AT FORTY PERCENT. YOUR COVER FORTY PERCENT OF OF THE SPECIAL EDUCATION BECAUSE AS I UNDERSTAND IT WHEN A WHAT IS NOW KNOWN AS ID A WAS PASSED IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES THERE WAS ASPIRATIONAL LANGUAGE ATTACHED TO THAT THAT. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT INTENDED. I'M GONNA GET A LITTLE TACKY HERE BUT AS I UNDERSTAND IT THERE. PLEDGE WAS TO PROVIDE FORTY PERCENT OF THE AVERAGE OF PER PUPIL EDUCATION EXPENDITURES IN THE NATION I. I DON'T ACTUALLY KNOW WHAT THAT FIGURE CORRESPONDS TO. IN TODAY'S DOLLARS A BELIEVE IT IS A SOMEWHAT. SOMEWHAT SMALLER AMOUNTS THAN FORTY PERCENT OF TOTAL SPECIAL EDUCATION EXPENDITURES BUT IT'S CERTAINLY MUCH. MUCH GREATER THAN. THE FED'S CURRENTLY GIVE AND SO IS THERE ANY. LANGUAGE AND AND THE FEDERAL LAW THAT. WOULD. GIVE THE STATE. SOME KIND OF A LEGAL CLAIM FOR A A RIGHT UNFUNDED MANDATE DON'T BELIEVE THAT THERE IS. THE STATE HAS ANY LEGAL STANDING TO THAT I BELIEVE IT WAS JUST ASPIRATIONAL LANGUAGE. OKAY. I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY YOUR COMMENTS EARLIER. AS TO THE. OVER AND UNDER I DIFFERENT IDENTIFICATION YOU YOU WERE TALKING. JUST AS THE PERCENTAGE OF STUDENTS IN. AND A DIFFERENT RACIAL GROUPS WHETHER THEY'RE OVER UNDER THEIR OVERALL GENERAL POPULATION IS THAT CORRECT CORRECT OKAY SO YOU'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT OVER UNDER DIAGNOSIS. YES. WAS NOT MEANING TO MAKE ANY MEDICAL CLAIMS WE WE DON'T KNOW IF DIFFERENCES IN REPRESENTATION IN SPECIAL EDUCATION REPRESENT. AND TO WHAT DEGREE THEY REPRESENT DIFFERENCES IN THE ACTUAL INCIDENCE DISABILITIES AS OPPOSED TO. DIFFERENT PRACTICES FOR IDENTIFYING DISABILITIES ARE. AND FINALLY I. DON. OFTEN HEAR ANECDOTAL. OPINIONS THAT. THAT. THAT THERE IS A HIGHER INCIDENCE OF DIAGNOSES ESPECIALLY OF AUTISM AND. HIGHER SOCIAL ECONOMIC. COMMUNITIES BECAUSE THEY HAVE ACCESS TO MORE ADVOCATES IN ORDER TO. ADVOCATE AND OBTAIN. THE EYEPIECE A IS THERE ANY EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THAT. SO FIRST WE WE'VE. ALSO HEARD THAT CLAIM OFTEN. IT. I'VE RECENTLY REVIEWED THE LITERATURE ON THIS SIDE I WOULD SAY IT'S MIXED. OKAY THANK YOU. WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MISTER ANDERSON AND AS IT WILL BE IN TOUCH MOVING FOR AND I'M SURE OTHER MEMBERS WILL BE AS WELL AS TO DO PROCEDURE PRESENTATION I THINK YOU'VE GIVEN US A LOT OF FOOD FOR THOUGHT FOR THE NEXT. WHICH IS JUST. JAM PACKED WITH GREAT PERSPECTIVE SO THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER EDISON LET'S CALL UP. FRANCISCO ESCOVEDO IS THE SUPERINTENDENT CHULA VISTA ELEMENTARY SCHOOL DISTRICT. BRAZIL THE PRETEND OF KEYS UNION SCHOOL DISTRICT. ANNEMARIE YELLOW ALSO IS THE DIRECTOR OF SANTA CLARA COUNTY SELFLESS.

I HAVE BEEN HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FROM OUR CALIFORNIA SCHOOL BUSINESS OFFICERS ASSIST ORGANIZATION CASCO WHICH HAS A VERY IMPORTANT PERSPECTIVE IN THIS IS WE TRY TO MAKE. THE WHOLE SYSTEM PENCIL OUT FINANCIALLY. THEY WERE ALSO CAN HEAR SOME FROM SOME SOME EDUCATORS WHO ARE NOT ON THE MINISTER OF SITES A ROBBIE CRATES. WHOSE SPECIAL EDUCATION RESOURCE TEACHER AT DUBLIN UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT MARTHA PANDERING WHO'S A RETIRED SPECIAL EDUCATION PARA PROFESSIONAL. FROM TRIM TWIN RIVERS UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT WE ALL KNOW THE PARISER ARE VERY IMPORTANT PIECE OF THIS PUZZLE TO. AND WE'RE VERY MUCH LOOKING FORWARD TO HER TESTIMONY. AND THEN KARINA LOOK QUEEN IS APPARENT LEADER FROM THE SPANISH LANGUAGE SPECIAL EDUCATION PARENT SUPPORT GROUP FROM PREVIEW COUNTIES WE'RE GONNA HAVE A. AN IMPORTANT. PARENTAL PERSPECTIVE TOO SO WE REALLY HAVE. THE THE WHOLE GAMUT OF PERSPECTIVES IN THE SYSTEM REPRESENT THIS PANEL AND I'M REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO IT. OUT I'D LOVE TO START WITH FRANCISCO SQUARE THOUGH. I WILL PRESENT HIS TESTIMONY. THANK YOU. BUT A GREAT MORNING AND AND YOU KNOW I WILL SAY GAVE KEVIN AND I WERE COMMENTING THAT OFTENTIMES THE POUR LA O. GETS ALL OF THE QUESTIONS OF THE ENERGY FROM THE MEMBERS. AND AND AND HERE WE HAVE THIS GREAT. RANGE OF OF LOCAL PERSPECTIVES FROM EVERY LEVEL OF THE GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE AND I HOPE THE MEMBERS WILL. WILL ENGAGE THEM AS WELL AS THERE'S A LOT OF KNOWLEDGE HERE. THANK YOU FOR THE GREAT MORNING I'VE REALLY LEARNED A LOT FROM THE QUESTIONS AND THE. DATA SHARED MY NAME IS FRANCISCO SQUARE THEN THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE TWO OF US ELEMENTARY SCHOOL DISTRICT. TO THE BASIS IS SOUTH OF SAN DIEGO IS THE LARGEST LEMENTARY DISTRICT IN CALIFORNIA. WHERE? WE SERVE OVER THIRTY THOUSAND PRE K. US SIX KIDS. WE HAVE FORTY SIX SCHOOLS OF FIVE OF THOSE SCHOOLS ARE CHARTER SCHOOLS BY THE WAY DEPENDENT CHARTER SCHOOLS THAT WE CONVERTED. A WE'RE ABOUT FIVE MILES FROM THE BOARD OF MEXICO. ARE WE SERVE A LARGE MILITARY POPULATION. WHERE APPROXIMATELY IN SOME OF OUR SCHOOLS TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE STUDENT POPULATION ARMED MILITARY AFFILIATED? WE HAVE APPROXIMATELY THIRTY FIVE PERCENT OF OUR STUDENTS FOR ENGLISH LEARNERS. FIFTY ONE PERCENT PARTICIPATE IN THE FREE REDUCE UP PRICE LUNCH PROGRAM. AND CLOSE TO ELEVEN THOUSAND ARE DEAD FIVE SPECIALISTS WE HAVE APPROXIMATELY THREE THOUSAND OF OUR STUDENTS THAT ARE. OUR SPECIAL ED STUDENTS UP. TO THIS DAY IS IS IS A GREAT DIVERSE PLACE WE BELIEVE THAT EVERY CHILD IS AN INDIVIDUAL OF GREAT WORTH NO MATTER. YOU KNOW CHARLES ZIP CODE GENDER COLOR DISABILITY WE EXPECT OUR. STUDENTS TO PERFORM ABOUT THEIR POTENTIAL. WE'VE HAD GREAT SUCCESS IN DOING THAT WE IF YOU LOOK AT THAT FIVE BY FIVE DASH BOARD I'M SURE MANY OF YOU HAD. A GREAT TIME ENJOYED. LOOKING THROUGH IT MANY OF OUR ENGLISH LEARNERS AND SPECIAL LET MATTERS A GREAT TIME WAS HAD A GREAT TIME I KNOW THAT WITH TIME. AND WAS JUST IN A. AT AT. BUT YOU'LL SEE MANY FOR ENGLISH LEARNERS AND. STUDENT FROM MOM POVERTY AT AT THAT THE GREEN GREEN GREEN SECTOR. YEAH ONE OF ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT WERE SEEN THOUGH ALTHOUGH WE'RE HAVING AN AMAZING ACADEMIC SUCCESS WITH VIDEO FOR TARGET GROUPS. ESPECIALLY POPULATION IS THAT THE RED RED AREA WHICH IS WHICH IS FOR US RIGHT NOW. A. WE'RE A LEVEL OF URGENCY AND HOW DO WE SUPPORT OUR SPECIAL ED STUDENTS TRULY TRULY IS IT IS A BIG ISSUE. LEVEL TERMS OF ACADEMIC OUTCOMES OR ACADEMIC OUTCOMES SICK EXACTLY EXACTLY AND ONE OF THINGS THAT I'VE BEEN HEARING THROUGHOUT IS IT IS IMPORTANCE OF. OF SUPPORTING OUR KIDS AT AT A YOUNGER AGE AND AND ONE OF THINGS THAT I SEE IS THAT. BY THE TIME STUDENTS ARE IDENTIFIED AND ARE IN SPECIAL ED. THEY'RE AT A FOURTH FIFTH SIXTH GRADE LEVEL RIGHT AND I BUY THAT THAT TIME. THAT EARLY INTERVENTION IS NOT THIS IS NOT MAKING THE INROADS NECESSARY NECESSARY TO CELEBRATE ACHIEVEMENT. SO I REALLY WANT TO FOCUS ON ON PRE K. BECAUSE I REALLY DO BELIEVE INVESTMENT AS. AT AN EARLY AGE. REALLY WILL MAY MAKE A SIGNIFICANT INPUT. JAB AT SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENT I WANNA HIGHLIGHT TWO SPECIFIC STUDIES STUDY FROM DUKE UNIVERSITY IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN FOUND THAT THE ATTENDANCE IN PRESCHOOL. REDUCES THE LIKELIHOOD THAT A CHILD WILL NEED OR NEED TO BE PLACED IN A SPECIAL DAY CLASS BY THIRTY NINE PERCENT. YOU KNOW THAT'S THAT'S REALLY SIGNIFICANT. ANOTHER STUDY BY THE NATIONAL FORUM ON EARLY CHILDHOOD POLICY AND PROGRAMS FOUND THAT HIGH QUALITY EARLY. CHILDHOOD INTERVENTION PROGRAM CAN YIELD. FOUR TO NINE DOLLARS AND RETURN FOR EVERY ONE DOLLAR INVESTED. IN I JUST WANT TO SHARE WHAT. REITERATE WHAT ASSEMBLY PERSON I CHAVEZ SAID THIS IS THIS IS. THIS NOT COMPLEX IT IS A COMPLEX ISSUE SPECIAL LEAD WITH ALL. ALL THE. CHALLENGES BUT THE INVESTMENT AND HOW WE NEED TO EARMARK DISINVEST MATTER PRESCHOOL AGE IS CLEAR IS CLEAR AND WE TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT TO THE MISTER. WE HAVE ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED AND TWELVE SPECIAL THAT. PRE SCHOOL STUDENTS. ARE THE VAST MAJORITY ARE IN SPECIAL DAY CLASS ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTEEN. ONLY FORTY TWO ARE AN INCLUSION CLASS. WELL. BUT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY TWO ARE IN WHAT WE CALL COMMUNITY SPEECH CLASSROOMS THE COST PER STUDENT IS ABOUT TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS PER STUDENT WE. EXPAND TO EIGHT POINT NINE MILLION DOLLARS AND ONLY RECEIVE ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN FEDERAL FUNDS WHICH. WE NEED TO COVER EIGHTY EIGHT PERCENT OF OF THAT BECAUSE IT IS A SIGNIFICANT. SENT A SIGNIFICANT BURDEN YOU KNOW. BECAUSE OF THE UNDER FOUR FUNDED AT A SPECIAL ED PROGRAM IT IT LEADS TO DECISIONS THAT I BELIEVE. IS FAR FROM THE BEST INTEREST TO STUDENTS. YOU KNOW WE WE TEND TO PLACE MORE KIDS A SPECIAL DAY CLASSES RATHER THAN INCLUSION CLASSES. THEM THE MONEY IS USED. MORE IN A REACTIONARY BASIS RATHER THAN PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT FOR FOR OUR STUDENTS TO SERVE. OUR SPECIAL ED STUDENTS AND. I'M TALKING ABOUT GENERAL THAT TEACHERS ARE GENERALLY TEACHERS DON'T KNOW HOW TO HANDLE SPECIAL ED STUDENTS NEED TO MAKE MORE OF AN INVESTMENT. AT AT THE GROUND LEVEL. AT THE GROUND LEVEL IT IT ISN'T IT IS. ALSO SO CRITICAL THEY JUST WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU THAT. THE NUMBER OF PRE SCHOOL STUDENTS THAT ARE BEING IDENTIFIED. HAS INCREASED SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR I INTO THE VISTA LOAN. OUR NUMBERS HAVE GROWN BY SIXTY PERCENT SINCE TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN DUE TO THE INCREASE OF REFERRALS. AND AN INCREASE OF POPULATION OF COURSE YET THE FUNDING HAS REMAINED STAGNANT. SINCE TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN WE'VE OPENED THIRTEEN SEC PRESCHOOL CLASSES SERVING AN ADDITIONAL TWO HUNDRED TWENTY ONE ADDITIONAL STUDENTS SO. WE FEEL THAT WE CAN ADDRESS IT THIS ISSUE OBVIOUSLY BY PROVIDING FUNDING THROUGH A B. SIX ZERO TWO BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY HOW WE USE THE FUNDING. IS SO CRITICAL WE NEED TO INVEST AT EARLY AGE WE NEED TO INVEST. IN OUR GENERAL ED POPULATION AND WE NEED TO CREATE LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS FOR KIDS YOU KNOW CAN CAN ACCELERATE THEIR LEARNING. THANK YOU CRIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. BRAZIL SUPERINTENDENT FROM. HE'S UNION SCHOOL DISTRICT NOW WHERE'S KEYS. HE IS IS LOCATED ALONG THE NINETY NINE IN BETWEEN NOW I WOULD SAY SERIES MODESTO INTERLOCK SO GREAT. ABOUT THAT SAID CAN ALAN BERRY HILL COUNTRY ABSOLUTELY ALL RIGHT. WELL GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS AL YOU BRAZIL AND I'M A FIRST GENERATION IMMIGRANT AND A PROUD PRODUCT OF PUBLIC EDUCATION. I'M HERE TODAY REPRESENTING SMALL SCHOOL DISTRICTS AS THE PRESIDENT ELECT OF SMALL SCHOOL DISTRICTS ASSOCIATION AND I ALSO SERVE AS A KEYS UNION SCHOOL DISTRICT SUPERINTENDENT. THIS IS A SMALL SCHOOL DISTRICT IN STANISLAUS COUNTY OUR DISTRICT IS LOCATED IN ONE OF THE LOWEST FUNDED CELL BUS AND US RECEIVE LESS FUNDING THAN OTHER DISTRICTS. FOR NO APPARENT REASON. HAVE A CHARTER SCHOOL THAT ENROLLS FAR FEWER SPECIAL EDUCATION STUDENTS THAN THE TRADITIONAL DISTRICT PART OF IT IS BECAUSE THEY FEEL THAT THE SERVICES THAT TRADITIONAL DISTRICT IS PROVIDING FOR THEM ARE ARE. WHAT THEY WANT? THE ENROLLMENT OF OUR CHARTER IS THREE HUNDRED FIFTY SEVEN STUDENTS IN GRADES. KINDERGARTEN THROUGH TWELFTH. AND THEY HAVE LESS THAN TWO PERCENT SPECIAL EDUCATION. STUDENTS IN ADDITION TO THE CHARTER ARE SMALL DISTRICT CONSISTS OF TWO SCHOOLS AND ELEMENTARY THAT SERVES TKD. THROUGH FFTH GRADE WITH FIVE HUNDRED AND SIXTY STUDENTS AND THEN A SIX THROUGH EIGHTH. MIDDLE SCHOOL SERVING TWO HUNDRED FORTY ONE STUDENTS. WE HAVE FIFTY THREE PERCENT ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS NINETY TWO PERCENT SOCIALLY ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED OUR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES PERCENTAGES FOURTEEN PERCENT. OUR AND DUPLICATED COUNT IS NINETY SIX PERCENT AND WE HAVE APPROXIMATELY ONE HUNDRED STUDENTS ENROLLED IN OUR PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS FOR WHICH WE RECEIVE NO FUNDING. ALONG WITH SMALL SCHOOL DISTRICTS ASSOCIATION WE ARE COMMITTED TO ALL STUDENTS MOST ESPECIALLY THOSE. IN NEED OF SPECIALIZED SERVICES AS A RESULT OF LEARNING DISABILITIES. THESE ARE OUR KIDS SMALL SCHOOL DISTRICTS OPERATE AS A FAMILY. EVERYONE KNOWS EVERYONE. YOU FOR RECOGNIZING THE NEED FOR A DEEPER LOOK INTO SPECIAL EDUCATION AND FOR INVITING ME TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS HEARING ON BEHALF OF SMALL DISTRICTS LIKE MINE. IT IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US ALL TO LEARN FROM ONE ANOTHER. SMALL DISTRICTS BECAUSE OF THEIR SIZE DIMINISHED CAPACITY AND OFTEN LACK OF ACCESS TO RESOURCES. ARE IMPACTED BY CHANGES IN LAW REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS AND INCREASE COSTS AT A MUCH GREATER LEVEL LEVEL THAN LARGER DISTRICTS. NOWHERE IS THAT MORE EVIDENT THAN IN SPECIAL EDUCATION. WERE DOING SOME THINGS WELL RELATIVE TO SERVING STUDENTS WITH EXCEPTIONAL NEEDS BUT WE ALSO HAVE SOME AREAS THAT NEED SOME WORK. WE ARE MUCH BETTER AT EARLIER IDENTIFICATION FOR EXAMPLE WHICH IS WONDERFUL BUT THE SYSTEM IS NOT PREPARED FOR THE NEEDS NOR THE COSTS. I'D LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT SEVERAL AREAS A PARTICULAR CHALLENGE FOR SMALL SCHOOL DISTRICTS TRYING OUR BEST TO SERVE OUR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES. EQUALIZATION PRESCHOOL ACCESS LOW INCIDENCE DISABILITIES TRANSPORTATION AND CONTRACTING WITH PRIVATE PROVIDERS. EQUALIZATION FOR THIS EXAMPLE IS IS A VERY SERIOUS HURDLE BY LOCAL CELL PLAYING STANISLAUS COUNTY IS ONE OF THE LOWEST FUNDED IN THE STATE AS I SAID BEFORE. AND THERE APPEARS TO BE NO REASON FOR THOSE FUNDING LEVELS. MANY DISTRICTS ARE LIKE MINE ARE IN INVESTING IN OFFERING PRESCHOOL SERVICES WITHOUT STATE FUNDING. EARLY SUPPORT IS KEY BUT IT DOES COME AT A COST TO THE DISTRICTS. LOW INCIDENCE DISABILITIES LIKE LARGER DISTRICTS WE HAVE MORE STUDENTS BEING IDENTIFIED WITH LOW INCIDENCE DISABILITIES SUCH AS AUTISM. EMOTIONAL DISTURBANCE AND WE ARE ALSO SEEN GREATER EXTREMES IN BEHAVIOR. IN BUTTE COUNTY FOR EXAMPLE THE RATE OF STUDENTS IDENTIFIED AS AUTISTIC IS DOUBLE THE STATE LEVEL AND THEY HAVE SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT MORE EMOTIONALLY DISTURBED STUDENTS THAN THE STATE AVERAGE. ONE CAUSE MAY VERY WELL BE AS A RESULT OF NOT BEING ABLE TO FIND EARLY INTERVENTION PROGRAMS I MEAN. I'M SURE THERE ARE MANY OTHER FACTORS. MEETING THE NEEDS OF STUDENTS WITH LOW INCIDENCE DISABILITIES CAN BE CHALLENGING FOR SMALL SCHOOL DISTRICTS. IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR SMALL DISTRICTS TO FIND SPECIALISTS WHEN THEY'RE ONLY A FEW STUDENTS NEEDING SERVICES WITHIN THAT DISTRICT. PARTICULARLY IN THE AREA OF SPEECH AND LANGUAGE. PRIVATE PLACEMENT. IS ALSO A HUGE ISSUE FOR SMALL DISTRICTS THIS CAN RUN INTO THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS. AN STC CLASS FOR EXAMPLE TO AIDS AND A TEACHER OUT WITH LESS THAN PERHAPS THREE STUDENTS IN THE CLASS CAN RUN INTO THE COST OF ABOUT TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. IN THE CASE OF TWO SMALL DISTRICTS OUT OF SIX MILLION NOW YOU'LL BUDGET THEIR SPECIAL EDUCATION COSTS WERE IN EXCESS OF ONE MILLION. AND ANOTHER OF FOUR MILLION BUDGET THEIR SPECIAL EDUCATION COSTS WERE WELL OVER FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND. RELIANCE ON PRIVATE CONTRACTORS SMALL SCHOOL DISTRICTS DO NOT DO NOT HAVE THE CAPACITY TO HIRE MANY SPECIALISTS. AND THIS MAKES THIS VERY RELIANT ON CONTRACTORS THE INCREASE OVERALL OF THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN IDENTIFIED ON THE AUTISM SPECTRUM COMBINED WITH AN AVAILABILITY OF SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHERS OR RESOURCE IS A SMALL DISTRICT IS LEFT WITH HAVING TO CONTRACT OUT. MORE AND MORE AT THE MERCY OF WHATEVER CONTRACTOR CHARGES AND WHAT SERVICES THEY'RE ABLE TO DELIVER. THE LACK OF EQUITY ONE STUDENT HAVING AN AIDE FOR EXAMPLE PAID BY A PARENT'S INSURANCE WHILE ANOTHER STUDENT DOES NOT HAVE THAT LUXURY. AND THE MORE RESTRICTIVE ENVIRONMENT SUCH AS OUTSIDE INVOLVEMENT CREATES IT IS NOT IN THE BEST INTEREST OF STUDENTS NOR HIS OR HER CLASSMATES. TRANSPORTATION WE ALL FACE. PARTICULAR CHALLENGES WHEN IT COMES TO TRANSPORTATION ESPECIALLY FOR OUR RURAL DISTRICTS WHILE WE WOULD ALWAYS RATHER SERVE STUDENTS OURSELVES WE MAY HAVE TO UTILIZE AS ALFA. TRANSPORTATION FROM ONE OF MY STUDENTS AS AN EXAMPLE IS PROVIDED OUR DISTRICT AND EXPENSIVE WELL OVER SEVENTEEN ANYWHERE BETWEEN SEVENTEEN AND TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. ONE ZERO WE CHARGES ITS DISTRICTS TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS A ILE. WITH THE BUDGET CONSTRAINTS STUDENTS ARE OFTEN SUBJECTED TO VERY LONG RIDES WHICH IS STRESSFUL ON THEM AND THEIR FAMILIES THERE ON THIS BUS FOR HOURS. WORKING WITH OUR CELL BY SMALL pMORE RELIANT ON OURSELF AS IN COUNTY OFFICES FOR SERVICES. WE CAN'T PROVIDE IN MANY CASES SERVICES FOR EMOTIONALLY DISTURBED STUDENTS MUST BE PROVIDED BY OUR COUNTY SELF UP. HOWEVER WE ARE RELIANT ON THEIR CAPACITY AND MAY HAVE TO WAIT FOR SERVICES THIS IS NOT HELPFUL OR APPROPRIATE FOR THE STUDENT. THE ANNUAL SERVICES FOR ONE CHILD CAN VERY. EASILY FROM THIRTY TO FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. WELL WE HAVE A NEED FOR STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACROSS THE STATE SMALL DISTRICTS HAVE A GREATER STRUGGLE TO SERVE OUR STUDENTS. BECAUSE WE HAVE EVEN LESS ACCESS TO SERVICES OR PROVIDERS. ALSO IN MANY RURAL AREAS JUVENILE HOUSE OF CLOSED DUE TO THE LACK OF SUPPORT AND UNFORTUNATELY FOR SOME OF OUR STUDENTS THAT WAS THE ONLY PLACE THEY HAD ACCESS TO SERVICES. IT WOULD BE WONDERFUL TO HAVE SOME SORT OF REGIONAL SUPPORT SYSTEM IN PLACE. IN SMALL DISTRICTS OUR COMMUNITIES ARE OUR FAMILY WE DON'T JUST KNOW OUR STUDENTS WE KNOW THEIR PARENTS THEIR SIBLINGS COUSINS OFTEN GRANDPARENTS AND IN MANY CASES WE MAY BE RELATED. THEY ARE CHILDREN AND WE WANT TO GIVE THEM THE SERVICES THEY NEED WE ALSO WANT TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE PROVIDING OUR TEACHERS AND STAFF WITH THE SUPPORT THEY DESERVE. AND ALL OUR STUDENTS WITH THE EDUCATION THEY ARE ENTITLED TO AND DESERVE IT. WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE THE GOVERNOR AND THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION ON THESE EFFORTS THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR TIME AND CONSIDERATION THIS MORNING. THANK YOU SIR NEXT MUST FEEL ABBAS. GOOD MORNING. MORNING COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS ADAM REVEAL OF US AND I'M THE DIRECTOR OF THE SANTA CLARA. LITIGATION LOCAL PLAN AREAS OR SELFLESS WHICH RESULT SERVE OVER EIGHTEEN THOUSAND STUDENTS WITH EXCEPTIONAL NEEDS AND IS COMPRISED OF TWENTY SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND THE SANTA CLARA COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION. I FIRST CENTERS SPECIAL EDUCATION BECAUSE I WAS THERE MY BEST FRIEND AND MY COUSIN. BEING EXCLUDED FROM SCHOOL I WITNESSED THE BATTLES OF THE FRUSTRATIONS THEY AND THEIR FAMILIES FACE SO THAT THEY COULD HAVE THE SAME OPPORTUNITIES AS THEIR PEERS. I STILL FEEL THE FRUSTRATION AND I SEE HOW HARD EDUCATION PROFESSIONALS STUDENTS OF FAMILY STRIVES FOR EQUITY AND SOCIAL JUSTICE FOR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES. TODAY I WOULD LIKE TO TALK ABOUT SPECIAL EDUCATION FUNDING AS IT RELATES TO EQUALIZATION OF FUNDING. FUNDING OF SPECIAL EDUCATION AT PRESCHOOL AND FUNNY FOR STUDENTS WITH SIGNIFICANT DISABILITIES. IT'S BEEN OVER A DECADE SINCE CALIFORNIA ADDED ANY MEANINGFUL FUNDING INCREASES FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION EVEN THOUGH SCHOOL DISTRICTS BASIC GROWING FINDING NEED TO PROVIDE STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES AGES ZERO TO TWENTY TWO. A FREE AND APPROPRIATE PUBLIC EDUCATION. THE CURRENT SPECIAL EDUCATION FUNDING MODEL ALSO CALLED AB SIXTY TWO FUNDING MODEL IS BASED ON THE AVERAGE DAILY ATTENDANCE OF KATIE TWELVE STUDENTS. HOWEVER. WHEN A B. SIX THIRTY WAS IMPLEMENTED THE FUNDING WAS BASED ON PREVIOUS SPECIAL EDUCATION EXPENDITURES BY SCHOOL AGENCIES WHICH VERY THROUGHOUT THE STATE WHICH CAUSED AN EQUAL FUNDING. I OVERSEE FIVE SELFLESS AND THE BASE FUNDING RANGES FROM FOUR HUNDRED NINETY SIX DOLLARS SECOND LOWEST IN THE STATE TO SIX HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SIX DOLLARS SIX HIGHEST IN THE STATE. THIS MEANS THAT FOR EVERY STUDENT ROLLED IN SCHOOL WHEN JUST RECEIVED FOUR HUNDRED NINETY SIX FOR PEOPLE DOLLARS IN THE OTHER DISTRICT RECEIVES SIX HUNDRED SEVENTY SIX PEOPLE DOLLARS TOWARDS OUR SPECIAL EDUCATION FUNDING. THIS TRANSLATES INTO THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE EDUCATION STUDENT THE FUNDING EQUALIZATION OF SPECIAL EDUCATION AFFECTS ALL DISTRICTS INCLUDING BASIC A DISTRICT SINCE I HAVE BOTH. ADA BASE LCF INVESTIGATE DISTRICTS IN MYSELF AS WORSENING THE SITUATION IS DECLINING ENROLLMENT. PAIRED WITH THE INCREASING ENROLLMENT OF STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES WITH HIGHER LEVELS OF NEEDS AND GROWING COSTS AS A RESULT OF THE WAY THE STATE FUND SPECIAL EDUCATION EACH YEAR. WE ENROL MORE STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES AND EACH YEAR WE RECEIVE LESS FUNDING TO SERVE THEM. IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN THE CALIFORNIA SPECIAL EDUCATION TASK FORCE OUTLINED REFORMS NECESSARY FOR SUCCESSFUL SPECIAL EDUCATION SYSTEM INCLUDING A CALL FOR ADDITIONAL SPECIAL EDUCATION FUNDING. THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. HAS CONSISTENTLY RECOMMENDED THAT THE LEGISLATURE PROVIDE ADDITIONAL STATE FUNDING TO LEVEL UP ITSELF WAS EIGHTY SIX SO TO BASE FUNDING RATES. EQUITY INADEQUACY OF FUNDING FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION STUDENTS IS OF PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES HAVE LOWER GRADUATION RATES HIGHER UNEMPLOYMENT RATES LOWER ATTENDANCE RATES AND HIGHER EDUCATION POST SECONDARY TRAINING PROGRAMS. IN REVIEWING THE DASHBOARD DATA NEARLY TWO THIRDS OF THE DISTRICTS DIFFERENTIAL ASSISTANCE NEEDED SUPPORT WITH THEIR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES. INCREASE FUNDING WOULD ASSIST DISTRICTS WORKED TO IMPROVE THE ACHIEVEMENT OF STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES BY PROVIDING THE CURRICULAR INSTRUCTIONAL SUPPORTS IN THE LEAST RESTRICTIVE ENVIRONMENT. UNDER FEDERAL LAW DISTRICTS MUST PROVIDE SERVICES FOR PRESCHOOLERS WITH DISABILITIES BEING H. THREE IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN FIFTEEN TO SUCCEED NINETY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS IN FEDERAL GRANTS FOR PRESCHOOL. NO STATE FUNDS FOR PRESCHOOL HIS ALLEGED CATION AND SPENT FOUR HUNDRED NINETY MILLION DOLLARS FOR SERVICES FOR PRE SCHOOL AGE STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES. RESEARCH SHOWS THAT INTENSIVE EARLY INTERVENTION SERVICES SUCH AS PRESCHOOL SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASES STUDENT WITH DISABILITIES ULTIMATE EDUCATIONAL SUCCESS. ALLOW STUDENTS TO BE EDUCATED IN THE LEAST RESTRICTIVE ENVIRONMENT. PRESCHOOL PILOT PROJECT WITH THE INCLUSION COLLABORATIVE AND IT JUST BECAMEMY COUNTY EIGHTY PERCENT OF THE STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES WHO ATTENDED THE PILOT PRESCHOOL WENT INTO AN INCLUSIVE KINDERGARTNERS GENERAL EDUCATION KINDERGARTEN WITH SUPPORT. ACCORDING TO THE CALIFORNIA RESEARCH A REFERRAL NETWORK IN THE CALIFORNIA CHILDCARE PORTFOLIO IN THE CHILDREN NOW DATA BUT ONLY IGHT TO TEN PERCENT THREE TO FOUR YEAR OLDS RECEIVE HEAD START OR STEEP PRESCHOOL SERVICES. THREE OUT OF EVERY FOUR CHILDREN WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR STATE PRESCHOOLER HEAD START ARE NOT ABLE TO ACCESS THESE PROGRAMS YOU TO LIMITED CAPACITY ISSUES. PROVIDING FUNDING TO THE AB SIXTY TWO SYSTEM FOR PRESCHOOLERS WITH DISABILITIES WILL SUPPORT THIS TYPE OF SUCCESSFUL EARLY INTERVENTION PROGRAM. THE CURRENT AMOUNT OF FUNDING FOR STUDENTS WITH SIGNIFICANT HIGH COST DISABILITIES SUCH AS AUTISM BLINDNESS DEAFNESS OR SEVERE ORTHOPEDIC IMPAIRMENTS IS FAR BELOW THE AMOUNT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE THESE JEANS WITH A FREE APPROPRIATE PUBLIC EDUCATION. BY JUST ACCEPTING A TWO HUNDRED FIFTY PERCENT INCREASE IN STUDENTS WITH MULTIPLE DISABILITIES A FIFTY PERCENT INCREASE IN STUDENTS WHO ARE HARD OF HEARING A TWO HUNDRED PERCENT INCREASE IN STUDENTS WITH AUTISM OVER THE PAST TEN YEARS. THESE STUDENTS ARE ALL OFTEN NEED SIGNIFICANT SUPPORT SUCH AS ADDITIONAL SERVICES EQUIPMENT AND STAFF TO MEET THEIR EDUCATIONAL AND RELATED SERVICES NEEDS. THE CURRENT LEVEL OF SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING FOR STUDENTS WITH SIGNIFICANT DISABILITIES IS FOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTY SEVEN DOLLARS PER STUDENT WHILE THE AVERAGE COSTS ARE ALWAYS HIGHER. AN INCREASE IN FUNDING FOR STUDENTS REQUIRING SUBSTANTIAL SUPPORTS WOULD ALLOW DISTRICTS PROVIDE THE STUDENTS THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE ADEQUATE PROGRESS THE TECHNOLOGY TO SUPPORT MANY MORE STUDENTS WITH LOW INCIDENCE DISABILITIES IS QUICKLY ADVANCING BUT CAN BE EXPENSIVE. HAVING THESE DEVICES FOR THESE STUDENTS IS AN EQUITY ISSUE SINCE WITHOUT SUCH SUPPORT MANY OF THE STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES WOULD BE DEPRIVED OF AN AVENUE TO SUCCESS. IN CLOSING I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR THE TIME AND WILLINGNESS TO HEAR FROM MYSELF IN THE DISTRICT I REPRESENT. YOU APPRECIATE YOUR PERSPECTIVE. OKAY WARD WERE NEXT IN HERE FROM JEAN CHRISTOPHE GOES WHO'S THAT CBO OF SAN MARINO CITY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT AND ALSO. MORNING CASTRO HAD TWO ICE BREATH THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS SOME THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME ON THIS VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE. AS WAS STATED ON THE CBO FOR SAMMY DINO CITY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT I'VE BEEN SERVING STUDENTS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA FOR TWENTY ONE YEARS. SALMON AND DINO WAS A LARGE URBAN DISTRICT LOCATED BETWEEN LOS ANGELES AND PALM SPRINGS. A LITTLE BIT ABOUT OUR AMAZING AND RESILIENT STUDENTS WE SERVE FIFTY THREE THOUSAND STUDENTS. IN SEVENTY FOUR OF OUR SCHOOLS AND THIRTEEN CHARTER SCHOOLS. WE HAVE IT ON DUPLICATE ACCOUNT OF NINETY PERCENT. ARE HISPANIC POPULATION COMPRISES SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF OUR STUDENTS AFRICAN AMERICAN TWELVE PERCENT. WHITE SIX PERCENT ARE FOSTER YOUTH IS ALMOST ONE PERCENT AND SPECIAL EDUCATION IS. THIRTEEN POINT THREE PERCENT IT IS MUCH LOWER IN OUR CHARTER SCHOOLS. AND NUMBER OF SPECIAL SPECIAL NEEDS STUDENTS ARE INCREASING IN OUR COMMUNITY AND THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA AND WE KNOW THAT INVESTMENT IN OUR STUDENTS ALL OF OUR STUDENTS IS. THE BEST THING WE CAN DO FOR THEIR FUTURE SUCCESS ALSO THE COMPLEXITIES OF THE DISABILITIES IS INCREASING WHICH REQUIRES HIGHER LEVELS OF SERVICES. AT INCREASING COST OF INVESTING INTO THEIR FUTURE. ADDITIONALLY WE UNDERSTAND THE IMPACT OF TRAUMA AND LEARNING ON THE BRAIN. DUE TO EXPOSURE TO CRIME AND HIGH POVERTY IN OUR DISTRICT WE KNOW THAT OUR STUDENTS DEAL WITH TRAUMA WHICH AFFECTS LEARNING AND REQUIRES. THAT TIER ONE INVESTMENT AND THAT'S A BIG NEED IN OUR DISTRICT WHERE WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO EDUCATE ALL. ADULTS THAT INTERACT WITH OUR STUDENTS WE ALSO HAVE HIGH MOBILITY IN OUR COMMUNITY. SPC USD ARE DISTRICT HAS BUILT ONE OF THE LOWEST EIGHTY SIX OH TWO FINDINGS WHICH EXACERBATES THE DISPROPORTIONATE FUNDING DISTRIBUTED FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION. AND THE HIGH NEED OF SUPPORT AND SERVICES TO OUR KIDS. WE NEED TO ADDRESS HOW WE PROVIDE FUNDING FOR GROWTH IN SPECIAL EDUCATION YOU'VE HEARD FROM A NUMBER OF FOLKS THIS MORNING WHEN I GIVE YOU A REAL LIFE EXAMPLE. WE DECREASE THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY NINE STUDENTS THIS YEAR IN OUR TOTAL POPULATION. THAT'S ABOUT A FOUR MILLION DOLLAR LOSS IN LC FF WHEN THEY APPLIED. ATTENDANCE RATE. THEN. WE ALSO LOST TWO HUNDRED TEN THOUSAND ENTER AB SIX OH TWO FUNDING BECAUSE IT'S BASED ON OUR ENROLLMENT. BUT OUR SPECIAL ED POPULATION GREW BY ONE HUNDRED AND NINETY EIGHT STUDENTS SO THAT'S FOUR POINT TWO MILLION LESS. TO PROVIDE SOME SUPPORT FOR MULTIPLE NOBLE STUDENTS. ADDITIONALLY OUR PRESCHOOL SPECIAL EDUCATION POPULATION GREW ABOUT SIXTY STUDENTS OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS CONTINUES TO GROW. AT WITH VERY LITTLE FUNDING TO SUPPORT THE GROWTH AND NEEDS OF OUR YOUNGEST SCHOLARS AND YOU'VE HEARD. THE RESEARCH ABOUT EARLY INTERVENTION AND THAT IS WHERE WE REALLY NEED TO MAKE THAT INVESTMENT. AT A MINIMUM THE STATE SHOULD PROVIDE FUNDING FOR THE GROWTH IN SPECIAL ED THROUGH AB SIX SO TOO HAD WE NOT LOSS AT TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND. YOU KNOW IT'S ADDITIONAL DOLLARS TO SERVE OUR YOUNGEST KIDS. JUST AS THE NOTRE DISTRICT CONTRIBUTES TO SPECIAL ED OR INCREASES VARY BETWEEN THREE AND THREE AND TEN MILLION PER YEAR WE WILL BE ADDING THREE MILLION IN POSITIONS FOR NEXT YEAR'S OUR EARLY. SECTIONS. SOME OF THE THINGS OUR DISTRICTS DOING TO ADDRESS. SPECIAL EDUCATION WE HAVE REALLY STRONG MULTIPLE TIERED SUPPORT SYSTEM SPECIFICALLY IN THE INTERVENTION AND SMALL GROUP INSTRUCTION THAT TIER ONE IS WHERE WE NEED TO FOCUS A LOT OF. OF. OUR RESOURCES AND THAT IS TRAINING FOR ALL ADULTS THAT ARE WORKING WITH THEIR KID DOES NOT JUST SPECIAL EDUCATION. WE NEED MORE. AND ALSO OUR INSTRUCTIONAL AIDES AS WELL. WE ARE WORKING. CONTRACTING WITH WESTJET TO PROVIDE A FULL PROGRAM EVALUATION AS OUR GOAL IS TO DELIVER SERVICES MORE EFFECTIVELY AND EFFICIENTLY. AND WERE ALSO PREPARING OUR STUDENTS FOR LIFE AFTER K. TWELVE EDUCATION SO THAT THEY ARE SELF SUFFICIENT REGARDING THEIR DISABILITY. SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE WORKING ON AS WELL AS THE APPROPRIATE TRANSITION TRANSITION AND STUDENTS BACK TO GENERAL IT. WE DO HAVE ALSO VERY STRONG RELATED. EDUCATIONAL RELATED MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. VERY STRONG MENTAL HEALTH COMPONENTS AND. WE HAVE A STRONG CRISIS RESPONSE TEAM WHICH IS ESSENTIAL IN OUR COMMUNITY SO THAT OUR STUDENTS ARE IN A IN A PLACE WHERE THEY CAN. TEACHING AND LEARNING CAN OCCUR. WE HAVE SEEN HUGE INCREASING DEMANDS VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT YOU'RE HEARING HERE SPEECH AND LANGUAGE IMPAIRMENT HAS DOUBLED AUTISM OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS. WE HAVE A GROWTH IN AUTISM ABOUT FIFTY STUDENTS A YEAR EIGHTY SIX THIS YEAR ACTUALLY. OTHER HEALTH IMPAIRMENT. GROWTH AS WELL. BUT OUR PRESCHOOL AGE WERE SEEN ULTRA HIGH INCREASE IN AUTISM SPEECH AND OTHER HEALTH IMPAIRMENTS. SO SOME OF THE STRATEGIES THAT THE STATE COULD TAKE IS TO PROVIDE STATE SUPPORT THROUGH OUR EXISTING FUNDING SOURCES WE HAVE EIGHTY SIX SO TO ONLY HAVE A LC ABOUT. ALL DISTRICTS ARE DEALING WITH THE COST THE RISING COST OF SPECIAL EDUCATION AND KNOWING THAT THAT INVESTMENT IN OUR STUDENTS IS GOING TO PAY OFF IN THE LONG RUN TO BE. REALLY HELP OUR OUR KIDS TO BE SUCCESSFUL. WE WE NEED TO INTERVENE IN THE EARLIEST STAGES OF OUR CHILDREN'S LIVES. AND. FUNDING TO SUPPORT THIS WILL GO A LONG WAY. CONTINUOUS PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT TRAINING FOR BOTH GENERAL AND SPECIAL ED TEACHERS AND ADMINISTRATORS OF TALKED ABOUT THAT ALREADY. AND I THINK YOU KNOW I'VE ALREADY TALKED ABOUT EARLY INTERVENTION EVERYONE HAS TALKED ABOUT THAT BUT WHEN WE LOOK AT TEACHERS ENTERING THE PROFESSION. THE GENERAL ED TEACHER IS IT'S SO IMPORTANT THAT TIER ONE SUPPORT AND WHEN YOU THINK OF ALL OF THE THINGS A NEW TEACHER HAS TO BALANCE IN THE CLASSROOM. WE LOOK TO IS THEY'RE PAID APPRENTICESHIPS AND OTHER THINGS THEY CAN WORK WITH EXPERT TEACHERS BEFORE THEY TAKE ON. THEIR OWN CLASSROOM IT'S A LOT TO MANAGE BUT THAT'S THE BEST PLACE TO START WITH THE INTERVENTION. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THAT'S CERTAINLY TRUE. THANK YOU. I'M. OKAY. ALSO MORE COMPACT QUESTIONS FOR YOU COMING UP BUT. NOW WE HAVE A GREAT CHANCE TO HEAR FROM. A TEACHER. ESPECIALLY RESOURCE TEACHER FROM DUBLIN UNIFIED BY ROBBIE CRATES. WE'RE WE'RE REALLY GLAD TO HAVE YOU HERE MISS GRADES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS ROBBIE KITES AND I'M A MIDDLE SCHOOL SPECIAL ED TEACHER IN DUBLIN. PRESENT AT THE DUBLIN TEACHERS ASSOCIATION AND VICE CHAIR OF SPECIAL INTEREST THE TI. I AM I AM THINKING FOR INVITING ME TO TALK ABOUT THE REALITIES AND IMPACT OF UNDERFUNDED SPECIAL EDUCATION FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF A CLASSROOM TEACHER. MY TEACHING CAREER OF NINETEEN YEARS IT'S BEEN ONE MONTH WITH A FOUNDATION OF PASSION DEDICATION AND ADVOCACY. ON THE DAUGHTER OF TWO CALIFORNIA PUBLIC EDUCATORS WHO HAVE INSPIRED ME ON MY PATH TODAY. I STARTED MY SPECIAL ARTWORK IN FIFTH GRADE WHEN I APPLIED TO BE A READING CLASSROOM BODY FOR SPECIAL DAY CLASS. TWO DAYS A WEEK MY TIME IN THAT CLASS OF THE AMAZING TEACHERS THAT I HAD AT EDISON ELEMENTARY IN ALAMEDA OPENED MY EYES TO A DIVERSITY OF STUDENTS SOME OF WHO I STILL CALL FRIENDS TODAY. MY TEACHING SCHEDULE WHEN I FIRST STARTED INCLUDED A TEST PREP A MENTOR TEACHER WHO MET ME. AND WORKED ON ALL MY A PIECE A COOPERATIVE CO TEACHER SOMEONE WHO ASSISTED ME WITH STUDENT COUNSELING I WAS SUPPORTED. NINETEEN YEARS AGO AS A NEW TEACHER I DID NOT KNOW THAT THERE WOULD BE A HUGE SHORTAGE IN SPECIAL EDUCATION I WAS EXTREMELY NAIVE. THAT WAS MY NORMAL AS THE LEAD TEACHER FOR MY DEPARTMENT NOW I DO NOT HAVE THE SUPPORT AND RESOURCES TO GIVE MY NEW TEACHERS. I CAN COACH AND MENTOR BUT THE TIME AND RESOURCES ARE NOT ALLOCATED AS THEY WERE NINETEEN YEARS AGO. I'M STILL IN MY SAME TEACHING POSITION OUT MY SAME SCHOOL BUT THE REST OF MY TEAM TURNS OVER EVERY THREE YEARS ON AVERAGE. THIS IS A CHALLENGING TEACHING ASSIGNMENT. DURING MY FIRST TWO YEARS I HAD TO LEARN FIRST HAND WHAT THE COURSE WORK DOES NOT PREPARE YOU FOR THE REALITY OF THE DAY TO DAY GAPS IN SUPPORT. AND THE BALANCING OF TEACHING WITH THE SPECIAL ED PROCESS. THEY'RE ALWAYS FISCAL FISCAL CONSTRAINTS THAT IMPACT ESPECIALLY TEACHER TO SPECIAL EDUCATION CLASSROOM. BEFORE I OPEN THE DOORS ON THE FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL THERE WERE GAPS AND RESOURCES FOR EXAMPLE. LAST FALL MY DISTRICT WAS GOING THROUGH THE PROCESS OF PURCHASING A NEW CURRICULAR ADOPTION. I KNEW THAT WE NEEDED THE SUPPLEMENTAL RESOURCES TO ENSURE THAT MY STUDENTS HAVE ACCESS TO THE STANDARDS ALIGNED INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS THE GENERAL EDUCATION STUDENTS HALF. HOWEVER THOSE RESOURCES WERE NOT PROVIDED AS PART OF THE PILOT. SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS ORDERING NEW MATERIALS FROM THE APPROVED ADOPTION IS EXPENSIVE BECAUSE THE GENERAL TO TO RECEIVE THE CLASS SAT IN A TEACHER'S EDITION. HOWEVER IS A SPECIAL ED TEACHER I NEED MULTIPLE GRADE LEVELS OF BOTH THE TEACHER AND STUDENT RESOURCES. AT GENERAL EDUCATION TEACHERS STUDENTS ARE COUNTED BUT MARTY'S OUR NEEDS ARE NOT FACTORED INTO THE BELT. I ASKED MY SCHOOL TEAM FOR AN ANALOGY THAT PAINTS A CLEAR PICTURE OF HOW IT IS TO DESCRIBE US AND WHAT WE DO AND THE PHRASE DUMPSTER DIVERS WAS THE BEST IMAGE. WE LOOK WE USE AND FIND SOMETHING AND WHAT OTHERS DO NOT NEED TO SUPPORT OUR STUDENTS SUCCESS HOW MANY CLASSROOMS AT MY SCHOOL HAVE AN ALTERNATIVE CURRICULUM. THAT NOT ONE PERSON CAN ASSURE WILL BE THERE ON DAY ONE. TOMMY DEPARTMENT SOLICIT DONATIONS FOR THEIR BASIC CURRICULAR NEEDS WHAT WE HAVE COME TO KNOW IS THE REALIZATION THAT IF WE DO NOT DO THIS WE ARE GOING TO HAVE WHAT WE NEED ON DAY ONE. AND IN NINETEEN YEARS HAVE BEEN AT MY SCHOOL WE'VE SEEN A RAPID INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS WITH AUTISM AND OUR STUDENTS WITH EMOTIONAL DISTURBANCE IP'S. THE REQUIRED MORE COORDINATED SUPPORT AND SERVICES YET ACCESS TO THOSE IS CHALLENGING. WE NEED TO ENSURE WE HAVE ADEQUATE SPECIALISTS COUNSELORS BEHAVIOR SUPPORTS INCLUSION SUPPORT PSYCHOLOGIST AND TRAINING FOR THE GENERAL TEACHERS. THAT YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT BEFORE HE TOOK TO BE A FEW OF THE ESSENTIAL RESOURCES FOR STUDENTS AS DETERMINED BY THEIR IP. OUR PROCESS IS THE TEAM IS TO LOOK AT WHAT WE NOW HAVE HOW WE CAN FULLY FUNDED PROGRAM THAT CAME INTO EXISTENCE IN NINETEEN FIVE OR NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE. THAT WAS NEVER BEEN FULLY FUNDED WE LOOK TO THE DISTRICT FOR HELP. WITH WHAT WE HAVE IN OUR OWN COMMUNITY AND THEN WE GOT OR SOMETHING. MY DISTRICT IS ONE OF THE MOST RAPIDLY GROWING DISTRICTS IN THE STATE IF THE SUPPLY OF MONEY AND ALL THE. ALL THAT GOES WITH IT IS NOT KEEPING UP WITH THE STUDENT DEMAND. EVEN THE EVEN WITH THE GROWTH WE ARE EXPERIENCING SPECIAL EDUCATION PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS CONTINUE TO GENERATE MORE CHALLENGES TO ADDRESS THE CHRONIC GAPS IN THE FUNDING NEED. NEEDED TO INSERT IT IS DONE SUCCESSFULLY. HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT ALL TEACHERS ARE TRAINED IN THE VARIOUS DISABILITIES AND THE SUPPORTS NEEDED FOR THE STUDENTS WE SERVE? HOW DO WE TREAT A TEACHER WHO ALREADY HAVE THE CASE LOAD OF A HUNDRED FIFTY STUDENT CONTACTS BAILEY? HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT LEGAL OBLIGATIONS ARE MET WITHOUT THE TIME THE TRAINING THE STAFF THE CURRICULAR RESOURCES TO DO SO? WE HAVE A LITTLE TIME FOR TRAINING AND MINIMAL IF ANY RESOURCES ARE SET ASIDE FOR TEACHER DRIVEN PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT. WE HAVE NO FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR THE NEED FOR INCREASED AID SUPPORT TO ACCOMPANY THE STUDENTS TO THE GENERAL EDUCATION CLASSROOM. SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHERS ARE EXPECTED TO MAKE IT HAPPEN WITHOUT INCREASED SUPPORT TO DO SO. WHEN THERE IS A GAP IN PROGRAMMING A BREAK IN THE CONTINUUM OF SERVICE A SHORTAGE OF STAFF MISSING CURRICULUM OR CHANGES TO PROGRAM DELIVERY. THEY ALL SHARE ONE THING IN COMMON A LACK OF FUNDING DESPITE THESE HEART HURDLES WE MUST CONTINUE AND NOT LOSE FOCUS. ON MEETING THE EDUCATIONAL NEEDS OF OUR STUDENTS. I STARTED THIS MORNING SHARING WITH YOU THE LITTLE PATH I TOOK TO BECOME A VETERAN SPECIAL ED TEACHER. AND LIKE TO I WOULD LIKE TO CONCLUDE WITH A STATEMENT THE CURRENT FUNDING FOR SPECIAL IT'S NOT ADEQUATE THIS MUST IMPROVE AND LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALL OF OUR STUDENTS SHOULD BE JUST THAT FOR ALL. THANK YOU AND I WILL BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU ALL HAVE. THESE KINDS OF MUSIC YOUR SENSE. YOU KNOW WE WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT HOW THE THE FINDING IS ACTUALLY INCREASE BUT YOUR BURDEN HAS INCREASED AS WELL AS YOUR SENSES JUST A LOT MORE KIDS TO. TAKE CARE OF WITH MORE SEVERE NEEDS IS THAT. WHAT'S HAPPENING OR IN MY PARTICULAR STUDY ABSOLUTELY AN INCREASE IN PERSON TO GENERALIZE. YEAH CRIME. ARE THEY GIVEN MUCH IS BECAUSE WE'RE GONNA HAVE A CHANCE FOR DISCUSSION AFTER THE REST THE PANELS GET TO TESTIFY. NEXT WE'RE VERY PLEASED TO HAVE A MARKET HENRY. WHO IS A PARA PROFESSIONAL FROM TWIN RIVERS UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT AND WE KNOW THAT THE PARIS AND A PLAYING A REALLY IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE PROVISION OF SPECIAL ED? SERVICES ON THE GROUND IN OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND WE'RE REALLY PLEASED TO HAVE YOU HERE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. BEFORE I BEGIN AT THE SERGEANT DOES HAVE COPIES IF YOU HAD A WE GOT IN THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT TO BE. THE MORNING CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF MY NAME IS MARK THE PENRY AND I WORK AS A SPECIAL EDUCATION PARENT EDUCATOR I WORKED AS A SPECIAL EDUCATION. EDUCATOR FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS ON TWENTY EIGHT YEARS TO BE EXACT. I ALSO SERVED ON THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION FOR TWELVE YEARS. AND CURRENTLY A SERVICE THE CHAPTER ADMINISTRATOR FOR CSAA'S ELK GROVE AT CHAPTER. CSEA REPRESENTS NEARLY TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEES ACROSS THE STATE. AND PARENT EDUCATORS MAKE UP ABOUT THIRTY THREE PERCENT OF THAT MEMBERSHIP. I WOULD FIRST LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR FOCUSING ON THIS VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE. FOREIGN AND FOR INCLUDING THE CLASSIFIED SCHOOL EMPLOYEE PERSPECTIVE. EDUCATORS ARE DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN THE SUCCESS OF IT OUT OF SPECIAL EDUCATION STUDENTS BUT OFTEN OUR WORK IS BEHIND THE SCENES. I HAVE BEEN ASKED TO SPEAK ABOUT THE GROWING DEMANDS ON SPECIAL EDUCATION AND THE CHALLENGES. EDUCATORS EXPERIENCE WHILE SERVING THE STUDENTS. LAW REQUIRES THAT SPECIAL EDUCATION STUDENTS LEARN IN THE LEAST RESTRICTIVE ENVIRONMENT BUT THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH PEREZ. TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL. THE INCREASING POPULATION OF SPECIAL NEEDS STUDENTS DEMANDS MORE PARENT EDUCATORS WITH REGULAR TRAINING TO HELP THE STUDENT SUCCESS GENERAL EDUCATION. SPECIAL EDUCATION PARIS ARE AMONG THE MOST DEDICATED EMPLOYEES ON SCHOOL CAMPUSES WORKING WITH SPECIAL NEEDS STUDENTS AS BOTH UNIQUELY CHALLENGING AND REWARDING. WE SPEAK WE HELP SPECIAL EDUCATION STUDENTS ACROSS ALL GRADE LEVELS ACHIEVE THEIR IEP GOALS. WE PROVIDE THE INSTRUCTIONAL SUPPORT AND ENCOURAGEMENT NECESSARY FOR THEIR INCLUSION OF SPECIAL EDUCATION STUDENTS IN MAINSTREAM CLASSES. WITHOUT PARIS SPECIAL NEEDS STUDENTS COULD NOT BE TAUGHT ALONGSIDE THEIR GENERAL EDUCATION PEERS. BEYOND ACADEMIC SKILLS WE WORK ONE ON ONE WITH STUDENTS TO TEACH APPROPRIATE WAYS TO RESPOND TO STRESS AND CONFLICT. HIS RESPONDED CHALLENGING BEHAVIORS ON A REGULAR BASIS AND LEARN EACH STUDENT'S TRIGGERS AND MOTIVATIONS. OUR CLOSE RELATIONSHIP WITH STUDENTS CAN MAKE US A TARGET FOR FRESH STATION AND AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIORS. BUT WE CHOOSE THIS CAREER BECAUSE WE LOVE THE STUDENTS WE SERVE AND AND BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THEY ARE ENTITLED TO THE SAME EDUCATION. AS EVERY OTHER STUDENT. THE POPULATION OF SPECIAL EDUCATION STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA IS GROWING. IN ELK GROVE SCHOOL DISTRICT EACH YEAR. THEY EXPAND THE PRE K. AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER PROGRAM TO OFFER MORE CLASSES. ONE FULL INCLUSION PERO TOLD ME THAT DURING ONE CLASS PERIOD AND. SHE WAS ASSIGNED SIXTEEN STUDENTS AND THREE DIFFERENT CLASSROOMS. IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HER TO MAKE EACH STUDENT. TO MAKE SURE EACH STUDENT WAS WORKING TOWARDS THEIR I EP GOALS. IT'S COMMON FOR FULL INCLUSION PARIS TO BE ASSIGNED MULTIPLE STUDENTS AND DIFFERENT CLASSROOMS. IF JUST ONE PARENT IS ABSENT AND A SCHOOL SITE THEY ARE FORCED TO MAKE DIFFICULT DECISIONS. ABOUT WHICH STUDENTS GET THE SUPPORT FOR THE DAY. STAFFING SHORTAGES ALSO CREATE SAFETY RISKS FOR BOTH PARENTS AND STUDENTS IT IS NOT UNCOMMON FOR MORE SEVERE STUDENTS TO ATTEMPT TO HARM THEMSELVES OR ARE PARENT EDUCATORS. WHEN SMALL ONE STUDENT EXHIBITS AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIORS IT MOST LIKELY ALWAYS TRIGGERS OTHER STUDENTS IN THE CLASSROOM. AND LESTER IS APPROPRIATE STAFFING THIS DISRUPTS THE ENTIRE CLASS AND STUDENTS MISS VALUABLE INSTRUCTION TIME. HOWEVER WITH THE PRO FOR APPROPRIATE STAFFING A STREET A TRAINED. CAN IDENTIFY TRIGGERS AND DE ESCALATE THESE BEHAVIORS. STAFFING SHORTAGES ARE NOT ONLY DUE TO THE INABILITY. OF FUNDING BUT ALSO HIGH TURNOVER AMONG PARIS. THE AVERAGE SPECIAL ED PARA MAKES FOURTEEN DOLLARS AND SIXTY ONE CENTS AN HOUR. AND CAN BE ASSIGNED AN OVERWHELMING NUMBER OF STUDENTS WORKLOAD FRUSTRATIONS AND EXPOSURE TO EIGHT AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIORS CAN CAUSE PEREGRINE OUT. BUT APPROPRIATE TRAINING AND SUPPORT CAN INCREASE RETENTION. A GROWING POPULATION OF SPECIAL EDUCATION STUDENTS DEMANDS THE PARENT EDUCATORS ARE SUFFICIENTLY TRAINED. THIS YEAR CSAA'S ANNUAL TWENTY FIRST DANIEL I MIGHT ADD. EDUCATOR PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT CONFERENCE SOLD OUT. DUE TO ITS OVERWHELMING POPULARITY. THE DEMAND FOR THIS CONFERENCE GROWS EVERY YEAR. THE MOST POPULAR COURSES INCLUDE UNDERSTANDING ANXIETY AND STUDENTS WITH AUTISM. MAXIMIZING STUDENT ENGAGEMENT MINIMIZING DESTRUCTIVE BEHAVIORS COMMON CORE. AND. AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS SAY TO SEE. THIS YEAR OVER THREE HUNDRED PARIS ATTENDED THE CLASS OF ON AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS. SO IN CONCLUSION PAIR OR ERIC PARENT EDUCATORS WORK DIRECTLY WITH THE STUDENTS. AND IF THE GOAL OF SPECIAL ED IS A MAINSTAY IS TO MAINSTREAM THE STUDENTS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE THEN THERE SIMPLY ARE NOT ENOUGH PARIS TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL. DISTRICTS DO NOT HAVE THE BUDGETS TO ADEQUATELY STAFFED TRAIN AND PAY THEIR SPECIAL EDUCATION PARIS. DESPITE THESE CHALLENGES PARENT EDUCATORS DEDICATE THEIR CAREERS TO HELPING THESE INCREDIBLE STUDENTS SUCCEED. BY PROVIDING MORE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT FOR EDUCATORS AND FINDING POSITIONS WE CAN BETTER MEET THE GOALS AND THE NEEDS OF THE STUDENTS TYPE HE'S. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR HOLDING THIS HEARING ON SPECIAL EDUCATION FUNDING AS THE CSEA LEADER I'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS FOR MANY YEARS. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME. I'VE ATTENDED A HEARING ON THIS CRITICAL ISSUE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR PERSPECTIVE IN YOUR SERVICE. OKAY WERE NEXT IN HERE FROM THE CRADLE OF KEEN.

WHEN OUR FAMILIES CALL FOR NORTHERN REGIONAL CENTER THE CENTER DOESN'T HAVE A BI LINGUAL RECEPTIONIST WHO CAN ADDRESS OUR NEEDS OR CONCERNS WHEN WE CALL FOR THE FIRST TIME. POSITIVE. AFTER CONNECTING WITH OTHER PARENTS THEY WANTED TO CONTINUE RECEIVING SERVICES FOR TRANSPORTATION WITHIN OUR DISTRICT. I REALIZE THAT THE MORE INFORMED WE ARE THE MORE BY WHERE WE HAVE TO FIGHT FOR SERVICES FOR OUR CHILDREN. HAVING A SUPPORT GROUP HASGIVEN ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO FIND OUT. ABOUT RESOURCES AVAILABLE FOR EACH MY CHILDREN THAT I WASN'T AWARE OF. ALSO HE HAS GIVEN ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO LISTEN TO DIFFERENT PRESENTERS. DRESSED UP BOOKS FOR CHILDREN WITH SPECIAL NEEDS.

THE TROOPS AT HOME WITH WITH NO ONE TO TO TO HAVE TO LOOK TOO SO I I THINK THOSE ARE THE ISSUES I THINK ACCESS VERY WILLING AS IS SMALL SCHOOL DISTRICTS ASSOCIATION. BUT AGAIN IT COMES TO TO THE POINT OF ARE WE INVITED TO THE TABLE AND OUR IS OUR VOICE BEING HEARD ARE ALLOWED TO AT LEAST BE SHARED SO I THINK THAT'S. YEAH WELL I THINK YOUR LINE OF QUESTIONING IS IS IS GREAT SENATOR AND I. I GUESS THE NUMBER OF US ARE HEARING THIS DISCUSSION WILL BRING THIS SPIRIT THESE ISSUES TO THE SUB. HEARING WHEN IT HAPPENS AND. MAKE A POINT OF FOLLOWING UP ON THE THINGS WE'VE BROUGHT UP TODAY. I CAN JUST MAKE A COMMENT I MEAN THAT'S THE POINT OF TODAY. SET THE TABLE FOR THAT. BUDGET CONVERSATION AND YOU'VE GOT THE TWO BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE CHAIRS HERE. LISTENING TO THIS SERIOUS CONVERSATION AND HIGHLIGHTING THE DEFICIENCIES WITH THE CURRENT FORMAT I MEAN THAT'S. THAT'S THE PROCESS WE'RE UNDERTAKING I WISH I HAD THE MEETING SCHEDULE IN MY DOWNLINE BUT. I DON'T. BUT AS SOON AS I GET IT I'LL LET EVERYBODY KNOW AND. THAT'S AND I'VE BEEN HEARING FROM VINYL YOU HAVE BEEN HEARING FROM YOUR DISTRICTS AS WELL. YOU KNOW THE DISTRICT SEVEN SHARING THEIR PERSPECTIVE WITH US AND YOU KNOW THAT'S WHY WE'RE DOING THIS YEP. YEP OKAY DECEMBER MCCARTY. YEAH THAT JUST ON THAT NOTE YES MISTER POINTY NOSE. STATED I I MONTHS SIMPLY SIDE OVERSEEING THAT BUDGET FOR EDUCATION AND WE'LL BE LOOKING AT SO THAT THE. PROP NINETY EIGHT EXPENDITURES AND ELSIE FAST SO THE GOOD NEWS IS THE GOVERNORS. ALLOCATION. FULLY FUND SELL CFF THAT THE BAND IS A WASTE OF A LONG WAY TO GO IS ART. SUPERINTENDENT SAID WERE SO FORTY FIFTH THE NATION IN PER PUPIL FUNDING AS MR MARTUCCI SAYS SOME OF THE DISTRICTS. BASED ALLOCATION DOESN'T KEEP UP WITH COMMITMENTS THEY HAVE WITH HIM PLAY COMPENSATION YOU KNOW RETIREMENT ALL THAT SO. YOU KNOW. COMPETING ISSUES WERE LOOKING AT THIS IS CERTAINLY ONE WHICH I THINK. WE SHOULD EVALUATE YOU KNOW WE'RE LOOKING AT. YOU KNOW PRE K. FOR ALL KIDS WHO ARE INCOME ELIGIBLE WE HAVE A LONG WAYS TO GO FOR THAT YOU KNOW CERTAINLY THIS. IS IT ISSUE AS WELL AS WELL AS TAKING A LOOK AT THE OVERALL. BASE RATE FOR DISTRICTS IN THESE LEADERS HERE ARE SHAKING THEIR HEADS THAT'S AN IMPORTANT ISSUE SO YES IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO BE ON OUR. ON OUR LIST TO TAKE DEVALUATIONS WITH ALL THE COMPETING ISSUES. BUT I DO WANT TO ASK SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT WE THAT WE ASK THE LAST pCOULD STEP IN. ESPECIALLY SOME OF THE DISTRICT LEVEL. THE FIRST IS MAYBE CAN FOLLOW UP ON THE QUESTION THAT THAT SENATOR ALAN NAST'S FARCE. CHARTER SCHOOLS IN IT GOD YOU KNOW TWENTY YEARS AGO WAS A DIFFERENT LOOK WE HAD THE CHARTER AUTHORIZATION OF COURSE TWENTY YEARS AGO BUT THE DIFFERENT LANDSCAPE AS FAR AS WHO'S BEING. SERVED IN THE FUNDING WAS LOCKED IN TWENTY YEARS AGO AND SO WHAT ARE YOUR. THOUGHTS ON ON THAT AND THAT THE FINANCING OF IT AND WHAT HAPPENS IN A REALISTIC WAY AND. AND IS THERE. AN INEQUITY AS FAR AS. YOU KNOW WHO'S THAT WHO'S PAYING THE FARE SHARE. NO THEY'RE DIFFERENT SHADES OF CHARTER SCHOOL SUMMER DEPENDENCE ARE INDEPENDENT SOME WORK WITH NETWORKS. I WOULD HAVE TO SAY I'M LOOKING AT THE ONES THAT ARE. INDEPENDENT FROM THE DISTRICT OKAY SO INDEPENDENT OF THE DISTRICT AID IS VERY DIFFICULT JUST BECAUSE OF SCALE. FOR THE INDEPENDENT CHARTERS TO SUPPORT SPECIALIST STUDENTS AND TYPICALLY WE RECEIVE A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER ARE FROM INDEPENDENCE. SCHOOL STUDENTS COMING TO THE DISTRICT BECAUSE OF LACK OF SERVICES OF OUR LACK OF SYSTEMS IN PLACE YOU KNOW SPECIFICALLY FOR SPECIAL ED STUDENTS. WHO? WE HAVE OF. AND OUR THIRTEEN CHARTER SCHOOLS THEIR SPECIAL ED POPULATION COMPRISES FOUR PERCENT OF THEIR TOTAL POPULATION WORDS OVER THIRTEEN PERCENT FOR A DISTRICT THAT CAN AND DO YOU THINK THAT'S. IT'S SAD BY BY CHOICE THAT THAT THERE'S DECISIONS BEING MADE TO MAKE TO HAVE THOSE NUMBERS REFLECT THAT A WORK. SOMETHING ELSE GOING ON I I THINK IT'S COMPLICATED I THINK. SOME FOLKS ALREADY TALKED ABOUT WHAT I THINK WAS THE LA O. ABOUT WHAT A DISTRICT CAN PROVIDE ALTHOUGH WE PROVIDE SERVICES TO ABOUT HALF OF OUR CHARTER SCHOOLS. SO I WOULD HAVE TO TALK TO THE SPECIAL ED FOLKS A LITTLE MORE TO SEE IF THEY ACTUALLY HAVE DATA ON THAT. OKAY. DON'T SEE ANY OTHER. INTERESTING ANSWER ASKING THIS QUESTION SO MY MY NEXT ONE IS THE. AS FAR AS THAT THAT THAT THE FUNDING. THE STRUCTURE AND MODEL. ARE THERE WAYS IN WHICH OUR FUNDING MODEL CREATES DISINCENTIVES TO SERVING SPECIAL ED STUDENTS IN MAINSTREAM ENVIRONMENTS. FROM THE. FOR INSTANCE THE MAKES IT MORE CHALLENGING THAN AN AS AND AS A MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC EYE WOULD I HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT I ABSOLUTELY NOT I WANT TO SERVE CHILDREN REGARDLESS OF WHAT THE FUNDING GAPS ARE. AS IS DISTRICT SUPERINTENDENT AND I THINK AS A CEO WE I I THINK THEY WOULD ASK MY CBO WOULD BE SAYING THE PROBLEM IS HOW DO WE DO THIS WITH LIMITED RESOURCES. SO I I THINK THAT. ANY HUMAN BEING WHO GOES INTO EDUCATION THEIR HEART IS IN SERVING KIDS AND SO THE PROBLEM BECOMES TRULY THE FUNDING MECHANISM ON HOW WE BEST DO THAT. I HOPE THAT ANSWERS YOUR QUESTION I THINK IT'S IT'S NOT AN EASY QUESTION OF SAYING. THAT IF THIS WERE THE SOLE FIX IT WITH SOLID. I THINK. I'M NOT SURE IF IF. WE'RE LOOKING MAYBE OUR SPECIAL IN A DIFFERENT MINDSET ALWAYS WONDERED WHY. SPECIAL THAT WAS INCLUDED AS PART OF THE EL CAP PLAN. JUST SEEMS LIKE ITSELF YOU KNOW THINK IT SHOULD BE YES. ABSOLUTELY THE FLIP SIDE THE ARGUMENT IS THAT IF IT WAS PARKED. SOME PEOPLE THINK THAT IT WOULD BECOME. LIKE WE HAD WITH THAT CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION WHERE YOU KNOW IT'S NOT A PRIORITY SOME DISTRICTS ARE JUST PUT IT TO THE BACK BURNER AND THEY YOU KNOW USE THAT. BASED ALLOCATION TO FOLKS ON THEIR NEEDS AND AND DO YOU THINK THAT YOU WOULD. SPEND THAT. ADEQUATE. AMOUNTS TO TAKE CARE OF SPECIAL AT. WELL NOT ONLY THAT BUT THE FOCUS WILL BE MORE SPECIAL LETTER WE WOULD HAVE MORE PUBLIC INPUT PUBLIC STAKE HOLDERS I MEAN. THAT IS THAT IS OUR OUR PLAN OUR DISTRICT PLAN BUTTON IN IT OUT OF. SPECIAL EDUCATION AWAY FROM THE LIMELIGHT YOU TAKE IT AWAY FROM THE CONVERSATION. AND BASICALLY SPECIALIST HISTORICALLY HAS ALWAYS BEEN IN THE BACK BURNER. AND IT CONTINUES TO BE THAT WAY BY TAKING OUT OF THE EL CAP. SO I UNDERSTAND YOUR POSITION HOWEVER AS A DISTRICT WE PUT SO MUCH ATTENTION ON EL CAP OVER WE'RE CONFUSING ELF CAPPERS LC AFFECTS THE DO YOU THINK THAT. THAT SHOULD BE PART OF THE PLAN HEATH BUT THAT'S NOT THAT'S THE PLAN BUT DO YOU THINK THE IT THE MONEY SHOULD BE. PUT IN WITH LCF AFTER WE SHOULD STILL HAVE THIS SEPARATE CATEGORICAL ALBEIT MAYBE AN EQUALIZED AMOUNT CATEGORIC RIGHT. I DO BELIEVE WE SHOULD BE PART OF THE US IF YOU DO THE THE FUNDING. OKAY. THANK YOU. WHAT KINDA ANSWER YOUR QUESTION IN TERMS OF DISSENT DISINCENTIVES FOR HAVING STUDENTS AND LEAST RESTRICTIVE ENVIRONMENT I WOULD SAY NO? YEAH I WOULD SAY IT'S A TWO FOLD. YES THERE CAN BE DISINCENTIVES BECAUSE AS YOU TALKED ABOUT EARLIER THE KINDS OF SUPPORTS TO REALLY MAKE STUDENTS THAT HAVE A SEVERE MORE OF A SEVERE LEVEL OF DISABILITY THAT YOU MAY NEED. IN ORDER FOR THEM TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN THE GENERAL EDUCATION CLASSROOM. THERE MAY NOT BE THE FUNDING TO SUPPORT THAT DISTRICTS. FOLKS WANT KIDS IN THAT GENERAL EDUCATION CATION CLASSROOM THEY WANT STUDENTS IN THE LEAST RESTRICTIVE ENVIRONMENT THAT IS WHAT EVERYONE IS SPECIAL EDUCATION REALLY STRIVES FOR. BUT AT WHETHER OR NOT IT IS SOMETHING THAT IS FEASIBLE DEPENDING UPON THE KINDS OF SUPPORTS THAT MIGHT BE NEEDED FOR AN INDIVIDUAL WITH SIGNIFICANT DISABILITIES. THAT'S ANOTHER QUESTION. IS IT. NINETEEN YEARS AGO MY CLASSROOM WAS MOSTLY MIDDLE SCHOOL SIXTH SEVENTH AND EIGHTH GRADE RESOURCE STUDENTS WITH LEARNING DISABILITIES AND NOW WITH THE CHANGES IN FUNDING AND PROGRAM DELIVERIES AND SERVICES AVAILABLE. I HAVE LEARNING DISABILITIES AUTISM EMOTIONALLY DISTURBED COUNSELING AND RICH STUDENTS BECAUSE THERE ARE MANY PROGRAMS AVAILABLE STUDY. AND THAT YOU KNOW THE ANALOGY OF A MOTLEY CREW OF STUDENTS IN MY ROOM WITH THE DIFFERENT GRADE LEVELS DIFFERENT ABILITIES HAS CHANGED BECAUSE OF THAT WITH LIMITED RESOURCES. OKAY. SIR MORE LIVE IN A SMALL PLACE YOU THINK RESEARCHER MISS CHRISTOPOULOS. I AM CURIOUS TO. TEACHERS LIKE MISS CHRIST'S. DO THEY RECEIVE SPECIAL PAY OR DIFFERENTIAL PAY. YOU KNOW THAT IS SOMETHING THAT AS A STATE WE NEED TO LOOK AT HOW DO WE ENCOURAGE MORE. BUT WERE IT IS DISTRICT TO DISTRICT. I DON'T KNOW THAT IN MY DISTRICT I'VE BEEN THIS IS MY THIRD YEAR AT THE DISTRICT I DON'T RECALL IF THERE'S ANYTHING THERE ARE SPECIALTY AREAS THAT WE PAY HIGHER FOR. IN SPEECH AND UP I MEAN SOME POSITIONS ARE SO DIFFICULT TO. HIGHER BECAUSE. OTHER AGENCIES CAN PAY THESE FOLKS A LOT MORE MONEY AND SO THAT'S A CHALLENGE AS WELL WE DID PUT ADDITIONAL. RESOURCES IN OUR NEGOTIATIONS A YEAR AGO I JUST DON'T HAPPEN IN FRONT OF ME. FOR SOME OF OUR SPECIAL ED. AND LOOKING AT THE CLASS SIZE TO TRYING TO KEEP THOSE MANAGEABLE. AM. BUT. I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT ALL TEACHERS GET SUPPORT. AND THAT WERE LOOKING AND THE FACT THAT ARE GENERALLY TEACHERS AS WELL SO THEY'RE ABLE TO. PROVIDE GOOD SUPPORT FOR STUDENTS THAT ARE IN THEIR CLASSROOM THAT ARE SPECIAL NEEDS. I AM I RECEIVE A STIPEND AS A SPECIAL ED TEACHER OF FOUR HUNDRED FORTY FOUR DOLLARS A YEAR. HERE I AM. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THAT'S SOMETHING TO LOOK AT ANOTHER DEALIO IS A RECOMMENDED THAT SOUL. IS JUST AN IDEA THAT JUST LANGUISHING OUT THERE. I I TOURED A. THE PRIVATE SCHOOL JUST AT TWO MONTHS AGO. THAT SPECIALIZES IN SPECIAL NEEDS KIDS AND. WAS QUITE AN EYE OPENER EYE OPENER FOR ME. SYSTEM TO MEET SOME OF THE KIDS THE TEACHERS BUT VERY SMALL CLASSROOMS. BUT VERY HIGH TUITION. SO THESE INSTRUCTORS ON THE PRIVATE SIDE. I WOULD THINK ARE ALSO LEAST BEING CONVERTED MAYBE A LITTLE MORE. TO. ONE OF THE REASONS I WAS THERE IS YOU KNOW TO HELP WITH THEIR GALA. TO RAISE MONEY. SO. I JUST THINK YOU'RE MISTER CHAIR WE OUGHT TO BE LOOKING AT DIFFERENTIAL PAY WE OUGHT TO BE LOOKING AT SOME INCENTIVES TO GET. FOR THESE TEACHERS BECAUSE THIS AREA IS GROWING. THE SECOND IS SOME. MISS A. IF I IF I LOOK CLOSER. BACK TO JUST A COMMENT ON THE ISSUE OF OF THE PAY. THE WE AS AS SMALL DISTRICTS WE VERY OFTEN OFFERED TO PAY FOR SOMEONE SPECIAL CREDENTIALING OR PROGRAMMER TRAINING. BUT THEN WHAT HAPPENS IS THEY COME BACK TO OUR SALARY SCHEDULES IN A DISTRICT THAT WE CAN'T COMPETE WITH LARGER DISTRICTS AND SO THOSE INDIVIDUALS THAN OUR LEARNED AWAY. BY A BETTER SALARY SO I THINK THAT'S ABSOLUTELY CRUCIAL THAT WE DO. EIGHT INDIVIDUALS FOR THEIR. WHO WHO GOES THROUGH MORE TRAINING THAN SPECIALIZE I MEAN THEY THEY THEY REALLY DO HAVE TO LOVE IT OR THEY WOULDN'T DO IT BUT AGAIN FOR FROM MY PERSPECTIVE IS YES I WANT TO PAY THEM BUT I CAN'T AFFORD TO? AND WHEN I DON'T I KNOW I'M LOSING THEM SO I'M CONSTANTLY TRAINING AND THEN THEY LEAVE. THAT'S THE. AND I APOLOGIZE FOR INTERRUPTING NO NO BUT IT'S GREAT I. PART OF IT. PART OF THE EDUCATION OF JUST VISITING THIS CAMPUS. IS THAT AFTER I'D INTERVIEWS STUDENTS. THE PRINCIPAL WOULD TELL ME. WHO THE STUDENT WAS RELATED TO? PRETTY SIGNIFICANT PEOPLE IN MY COUNTY IN RESERVE. YOU KNOW JUST KIND OF AN AMAZING. I THINK THEY ALSO ADDED I REALLY FEEL UNDERSTAND THE NEED SO MANY ASK A REAL NASTY QUESTION TO MS FILLABLE BELOW. VILLA LOBOS. YEAH I'M. THE PP I SEE RECOMMENDED TO DO AWAY WITH SELF AS. INTO I'M ALWAYS WORRIED ABOUT YOU KNOW SOMETHING IN BETWEEN. YOU KNOW IT IF WE'RE LOOKING FOR FUNDING COULD YOU. COULD YOU MAYBE AN. JUST A BRIEF BRIEFLY DEFENDANT WHY WE WE STILL HAVE SELF AS. I THINK THE EXAMPLE THAT I GAVE YOU FOR EXAMPLE. I OVERSEE FIVE SELFLESS. AND TWO SO MY DISTRICTS GET YOU KNOW. QUITE A BIT OF. OF I WOULD SAY. TECHNICAL SUPPORT AND ASSISTANCE FOR ME. AT A VERY LOW RATE SINCE I OVERSEE FIVE DIFFERENT SELF AS BUT THE REASON WHY IS EXAMPLE I GAVE YOU WE HAVE. ONE SELFLESS THAT RECEIVES. FOUR HUNDRED AND. NINETY SIX DOLLARS AND ANOTHER WHEN THEY GET SIX HUNDRED SEVENTY SIX AND THEY'RE LITERALLY RIGHT BUT UP AGAINST EACH OTHER. SO. AND THE ONE THAT RECEIVED SIX HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SIX DOLLARS WHAT. WHAT ENDS UP HAPPENING IS THAT? THEY RECEIVE A LOT OF MONEY THAT GOES FOR INFANT FUNDING. SO AS THE BENEFIT OF THAT THAT. BECAUSE OF THE DIFFERENT MUTUAL AGREEMENTS BETWEEN THOSE FIVE DIFFERENT TOPICS IN THOSE TWENTY DIFFERENT DISTRICTS THAT INFANT FUNDING THAT GOES TO THE REGIONAL PROGRAM TO OUR COUNTY OFFICE AND HELPS TO SUPPORT THAT. IF THAT WASN'T A RANGE THAT WAY THEN THAT MONEY WOULD GO AND STAY WITH THAT GROUP IN THOSE OTHER DISTRICTS THAT DON'T RECEIVE AS MUCH MONEY WOULD NOT RECEIVE THE BENEFIT OF THAT FOR THAT INFANT FUNDING. SO THAT THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF THIGS OF THE REASONS WHY SELF HELP EVEN OUT THINGS FOR EXAMPLE I HAVE THREE NINE HUNDRED DISTRICTS SMALL DISTRICTS WITHIN MYSELF AS. SO. BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT WE OF THE AGREEMENTS THAT WE HAVE WITHIN THAT SOUTH OF THE HELP ALL HAPPEN TO BE WITHIN MY ONE OF MYSELF AS WHICH IS SOUTH THREE. THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS THAT CAN BE DONE TO SUPPORT THOSE SMALLER DISTRICTS BECAUSE THEY SAID FACE SO MANY THE OBSTACLES THAT MISTER BRAZIL HAS ALREADY TALKED ABOUT THAT HE FACES AND KEYS. SO THOSE ADDITIONAL THOSE FUNDS FROM THE FRIEND THAT SUPPLICANT AND HELP THOSE IN ADDITION I HAVE TO SINGLE DISTRICTS UP A SO I KNOW WHAT THE FUNDING LOOKS LIKE FOR THOSE FOR SINGLE DISTRICTS UP. THE REASON WHY FOR ONE OF THE MAJOR THINGS THAT I SEE IS ONE OF THE DISADVANTAGES OF NOT HAVING A CELL BUT IS THAT THERE IS IT WHEN A PARENT HAS CONCERNS IN A SINGLE DISTRICTS ALPHA. THERE'S NO ONE TO GO TO. YOUR THAT'S THAT SELL THE THE ADDRESS THAT NEED AND WHETHER OR NOT THEY THEY CAN THEY DO ADDRESS THAT THERE'S NO ONE FOR. ANOTHER PERSON THEY CAN GO TO ANOTHER LEVEL WHICH WOULD BE ME IN THAT IN THAT CASE. SO IN ALL THOSE CASES I I MEAN NASA IN EXAMPLE RIGHT THERE IT WITH THIS AT THE SOUTH REALLY DOES HELP TO EVEN OUT AND MAKE A RANGE OUT OF EXPERTISE. ITSELF AS DIRECTOR GENERALLY HAVE A YOU KNOW IS IS A AS IT AS A PRETTY I DON'T BUY ONE BUT IT TO MY OWN HORN. BUT WE HAVE A VERY HIGH LEVEL OF EXPERTISE GENERALLY IN TERMS OF SPECIAL EDUCATION. SO I MEAN THAT IS ANOTHER REASON THAT I THAT I THINK IS THE THE SOUTH BUT SHOULD NOT BE. DONE AWAY WITH AND ALSO BECAUSE. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE WAY THE FUNDING MODELS CURRENTLY ARE YOU KNOW THAT SOMETHING THAT WHEN THAT SOUTH WHEN THAT REPORT CAME OUT BASICALLY DISTRICTS WERE NOT ADDRESSED. AND I HAVE A NUMBER OF BASIC EIGHT DISTRICTS AND HOW FUNNY WOULD LOOK FOR THEM WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS AN ADJUSTMENT. IC REPORT EITHER SO MY BASIC EIGHT DISTRICTS ARE VERY MUCH CONCERNED WITH THE PP I SEE REPORT CAME OUT THAT THEY WEREN'T MENTIONED AND WHAT WOULD BE HAPPY WITH THEIR FUNDING LOOK LIKE FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION. THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME HIT A NERVE. DOES. DOES ANYONE AROUND THE TABLE WANT TO TAKE THE OPPOSITE POSITION AND MAYBE WE HAVE SOME. DEBATE. DONNA YOU CHICKENS. BUT SO EVERYONE SUPPORTS THE CELL PRESIDENT IN PP I SEE IS THE OUT LIAR OKAY THANK YOU FOR THE DELAY THING I WOULD SAY IS THERE ARE DIFFERENT. NOT EVERY CELL BUT IS THE SAME AND SO THE LEVEL OF SERVICE IN THE EXPERTISE AND SOME OF THEM DIFFERS GREATLY AND IT DEPENDS ON THE REGION. AT AND SO I'M NOT TAKING I WALK I WOULD NEVER WANT TO SEE MYSELF WITHOUT A SELF PIE WILL SAY THAT AS A SUPERINTENDENTHOWEVER. THAT THERE ARE LEVELS FROM COUNTY TO COUNTY. FROM SINGLE. DISTRICT SL PLUS TWO COUNTIES HELP US AND THEY ARE TRULY DIFFERENT. THANK YOU WHAT WHAT IS THE CORE IT WHAT'S YOUR NURSING AT THE CORE OF THE PKC IS CRITIQUE OF THIS UP AS. WELL I I ALWAYS FIND IT INTERESTIG EXTERNAL MARKET BALLS SORRY PRETTY WELL SO. I WAS KIND OF FIND IT INTERESTING THAT THEY'RE COMING UP WITH A PERSPECTIVE THAT'S A LITTLE DIFFERENT SO. I JUST WANTED TO KIND OF GET THE. THE FIELD BUT COULD JUST CONSUMING CRYSTALLIZE WHAT IS TAKE ME TO PULL ITS PURPOSE IN THE PACKAGE. OF ONE I'LL GET BACK TO YOU OKAY OKAY OKAY. YEAH I THINK YOU GUYS CENTERPOINT YOU KNOW. A COUPLE THINGS SO. AS FAR AS THE BUDGETS OF HEARING SCHEDULE IT'S ACTUALLY GOING TO GET THREE DIFFERENT PIECES A SPECIAL ED ON THREE DIFFERENT DAYS. APRIL FIFTH. CHILDCARE RELATED SPECIAL ED ISSUES WILL BE DISCUSSED ON MAY THIRD. THE SPECIAL ED TEACHER PROPOSALS ARE GOING TO BE DISCUSSED ON APRIL TWENTY SIX BE OUT EVERYTHING THAT WE HAVEN'T COVERED. RELATED TO SPECIAL AND OTHER SPECIAL ISSUES ARE GONNA BE ON APRIL TWENTY SIX SO AGAIN APRIL FIFTH CHILDCARE APRIL TH OF MAY THIRD SPECIAL ED TEACHER PROPOSALS APRIL TWENTY SIX. OTHER SPECIAL ED ISSUES. AND I DID HAVE SORT OF ONE SORT OF. A QUESTION. AND I WANT TO HAVE AUDIENCE PARTICIPATION WITH A SHOW OF HANDS. IF THAT'S OKAY MISTER CHAIR. MY DISTRICT'S SORT OF ON. WEATHER SPECIAL ED FUNDING SHOULD BE ROLLED INTO ELSEY FF IT SEEMS TO BE THE PREVAILING OPINION NOT TO ROLL WITH INTEL CFF BUT TO. SOLVE THE FINDING AN ACT INEQUITIES IN AB SIX OH TWO SEPARATELY SO WHO THINKS IT SHOULD BE ROLLED INTO ELSEY FF RAISE YOUR HAND. OKAY WHO THINKS WE SHOULD FIND THE INEQUITIES IN SIX SIX SO TO. RAISE YOUR HAND. YOU GUYS HERE CAN RAISE YOUR HANDS TO IS THAT THE. OKAY JUST WANT TO SEE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR HAD THAT SOUNDS LIKE A CENTER MORE LIKE I KNOW CEMETERY WAS TALKING BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE MAYBE APRIL TWENTY SIX WILL BE GOOD OPTION TO ENGAGE FINANCE. ON THE ISSUES YOU'RE RAISING EARLIER AT THE BUDGET SUB. ITEMS JUST ANNOUNCED BY THE CENTER FOR TINA WE NEXT LOVE TO TURN TO SENATOR VOCAL. THANKS FOR THE PROMOTION. THIS AGAIN. BACK I'M ACTUALLY SEE SOME OF ARABS A VERY FAST. SO. IT'S GREAT HAVING THIS IS A BY A CAUCUS THAT. THEY HADN'T DREAMT MULTI HOUSE A HEARING HERE SO WE WE WE DO APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE REGARDLESS OF WHICH HOUSE OR IN. THANK YOU SENATOR. I JUST WANTED TO. A GREATLY WELCOMED. TO THE BEST ELEMENTARY SCHOOL DISTRICT AND. MR BIZARRO. I HAD THE HONOR TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR SCHOOL DISTRICT FOR OVER TWENTY SEVEN YEARS AND RISK MANAGEMENT DEPARTMENT SO. I KNOW. THE DISTRICT INSIDE AND OUT. AND I WOULD LIKE TO ALSO HONOR EVERYONE GIVING TESTIMONY HERE TODAY BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH TO INVESTORS MODELS EACH CHILD AS AN INDIVIDUAL OF GREAT WORTH I THINK YOU SHARE THAT. ALL. AND YOU DON'T DO IT FOR MONEY YET DO IT FOR LOVE. IN MY DISTRICT WHICH IS EAST COUNTY SAN DIEGO. IT'S IT'S URBAN AND A GREAT. DEAL OF. RURAL. TWENTY PERCENT. OF SYRIAN REFUGEES COME TO MY DISTRICT. SO THAT. PUTS A NEW. SOME SAID INTO SPECIAL NEEDS A MATCH AND HAVING AN AUTISTIC CHILD OR SPECIAL NEEDS CHILD. THAT HAS NEVER GONE TO SCHOOL. AJ THERE NINE. AND THEY WON'T. REACT TO ANY SCHOOL BELLS OR ANYTHING BECAUSE THAT'S AN ALARM BELL THEY WON'T LINE UP FOR CAFETERIA BECAUSE SNIPERS COULD PICK THEM OFF. ALL RIGHT NOW YOU TAKE THOSE SPECIAL NEEDS CHILDREN. WHOA DOCTOR THAT'S A TOUGH ONE. OKAY FROM JUST WANTED TO. TO PUT THAT OUT THERE BECAUSE SPECIAL NEEDS GOES FROM. THE BEAUTIFUL TO THE ABSOLUTELY HELLISH OKAY AND EVERYWHERE IN BETWEEN. ARM. I WAS SOMEWHAT OF A. I HAVE A MILITARY BACKGROUND SO WHEN I RAISE MY CHILDREN IT WAS PRETTY. GOOD DISCIPLINE WITH LOVE OKAY. TRUST ME. WHEN YOU HAVE AN AUTISTIC CHILD WHICH I HAVE A GRANDDAUGHTER THAT SOUGHT TO STAKE. THEY DON'T GET THAT. THEY'RE GOING TO DO WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO AND YOU HAVE TO BE ON YOUR GAME. BIG TIME IN ORDER TO RUN THAT SO YOUR SPECIAL NEEDS TEACHERS AND. SUPERVISORS THEY'RE THE THEY'RE A CUT ABOVE. THE SO JUST SO YOU KNOW THAT. I WOULD LIKE TO WRAP MY COMMENTS UP WITH. ONCE AGAIN I HAVE. AN ARTISTIC GRANDDAUGHTER THEIR PARENTS WERE VERY DISAPPOINTED IN CALIFORNIA'S SERVICES AND SUPPORT. SO THEY ACTUALLY SOLD THEIR HOUSE AND MOVED TO TEXAS SO THAT THEY CAN GET A MUCH HIGHER. LEVEL OF SERVICE IN THE STATE OF TEXAS. SO THAT'S WHAT THEY DID. AND IT IS TREMENDOUS THE STATE OF TEXAS IS FULLY FUNDED AND THEY HAVE WONDERFUL PROGRAMS BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE MONEY. MONEY IS EVERYTHING. THESE FOLKS ARE GONNA KILL THEMSELVES IN THIS ARENA BUT WE HAVE TO FUND THEM THEY HAVE TO HAVE THE MEANS TO PROVIDE. THE LEVEL OF SERVICE. SO THAT'S WHAT I LEAVE YOU WITH IS THIS IS A REAL DIFFICULT AREA. OF HUMAN SERVICE. AND THEY HAVE TO HAVE SOME KIND OF MONEY THAT'S IT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. SHE DOES COME INTO WHAT. I AM ITEMS PENDING OUTCOME IS GOING TO MAKE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I I HAVE A QUESTION FOR YOU FOR YOU AND I HOPE I'M NOT OUT OF ORDER. IF IF YOU RETURN TO YOUR DISTRICTS. AND DO YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO VISIT A PUBLIC SCHOOL. SPECIAL DAY CLASS. FOR AUTISTIC CHILDREN I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU DO THAT. YOU'RE GOING TO SEE WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WE CAN SIT HERE AND TELL YOU THIS. AMP FOR AND AND LAY EVERYTHING OUT IN FRONT OF YOU BUT INTEL YOU WITNESS SET. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ONE HUNDRED PERCENT I ENCOURAGE YOU TO DO THAT PLEASE. WELL I'M SURE THAT. DID THE MEMBERS OF THE INNOCENT OR NOT AND LET'S WORK TOGETHER TO. GET SOME TOWARDS ME WE CAN EVEN DO THEM HERE LOCALLY SO THAT EVANS CLOSE BY AND WE CAN. I KNOW YOU'RE BASED HERE SO ON THERE BECAUSE IF YOU WORK WITH THE COMMITTEE THAT TO GET SOME OF SET UP. SUMMARY. OF YOUR PRESENT ABOUT OKAY I'M. YEAH WELL I APPRECIATE THE DISCUSSION I'M I'M YOU KNOW CONTINUE TO BE. AN. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THAT I THINK WE HAVE TO SPEND SOMETIME LOOKING AT IS THIS ISSUE THAT I RAISED DURING THE LAST PANEL. ABOUT. AND. THE OLD SYSTEM PRETTY NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT. AND TODAY. AND HOW WE ENSURE. THAT IF WE'RE GOING TO MAKE SOME TWEAKS TO THE SYSTEM. THAT CREATES A MORE EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION OF FINDS. IT IS A QUESTION YOU MORE MONEY THAT'S. CLEAR. ON THE AWESOME BUT. DO YOU KNOW IF WE'RE GONNA FIGURE OUT A MORE EQUITABLE WAY OF DISTRIBUTING THE FUNDS WITHIN THE SYSTEM BASED ON. THE NEEDS OUT THERE HOW DO WE MAKE SURE. HOW TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T? THE MISTAKES THAT LED US TO THE POLICY CHANGES THAT WE JUST THAT WE MADE BACK IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT I LOVE IF SOMEONE COULD KIND OF DRILL IN A LITTLE BIT MAYBE. MAYBE YOU JANE. MARIANNE MARIE I DON'T KNOW I'D. YOU'RE BOTH PASSING BACK OF WHAT I KNOW IT'S A TOUGH QUESTION BUT IT BUT. YOU KNOW. THE REASON WHY WE PASSED A BE SIX OR TWO. WAS IT SEEMS THAT THERE WAS OF CONCERN OUT THERE THAT THERE WAS A. THERE WERE PURSED PERVERSE DISINCENTIVES. I WORRY THAT WE MAY HAVE SWUNG THE OTHER END OF THE PIT. YOU KNOW PENDULUM. I'M HOW WOULD WE CRAFT A BETTER SYSTEM IN TERMS OF EQUITABLE. DISTRIBUTION OF RESOURCES THROUGHOUT OUR STATE. TO REFLECT THE NEEDS THAT ARE OUT THERE. I THINK WE NEED A LOT MORE DATA BEFORE I COULD RESPOND TO THAT STATEWIDE. WHEN YOU LOOK AT EIGHTY SIX OR TWO IT'S NOT A LOT SAMMER DINO IS A LOW FUNDED. STRICT IN THE EIGHTY SIX SO TO ONE OF THE LOWEST. THERE IS SUCH A HUGE. DISCONNECT IN SUCH A WIDE VERY ANTS OF THE FUNDING. BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE AMOUNT PER PUSH PEOPLE IT'S NOT A LOT. I'M NOT COMPLAINING BECAUSE WE NEED IT. SO I THINK WE NEED TO STUDY YOU KNOW REALLY LOOK AT THE DATA STATE WIDE. AND LOOK AT. WHAT DROVE THOSE DECISIONS BACK THEN WHAT'S DIFFERENT NOW COMPARED TO WHAT WE WERE TRYING TO ADDRESS BACK THEN AND I THINK PART OF IT IS HOW DO YOU CONTINUE TO IMPROVE? WE CAN'T WAIT TWENTY YEARS TO DO THAT WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO LOOK AT WHAT WE'RE DOING. YOU KNOW ON ONGOING BASIS SO WE CAN MAKE CHANGES AS NECESSARY SO I KNOW I DIDN'T REALLY ANSWER THAT EXCEPT TO SAY I THINK WE NEED TO STUDY IT A LITTLE MORE. OKAY. I AGREE I THINK WE DO NEED TO LOOK AT A LITTLE MORE BUT THERE ARE SOME BASIC AND FUNDAMENTAL THINGS JUST IN TERMS OF THE WAY THAT THE CURRENT FUNDING IS DONE WHERE YOU HAVE YOU HAVE DECLINING ENROLLMENT. IN GENERAL EDUCATION IN YOUR TOTAL ADA POPULATION BUT THEN YOU HAVE AN INCREASING AROUND ITS SPECIAL AT. THAT THAT THAT IT THAT SUIT ON ONGOING ISSUE AND I AND I'M TEN OF MY DISTRICTS OF DECLINING ENROLLMENT. ARE FACING THAT SITUATION WITH AN INCREASE SO THERE I AM SO THE FUN THEY HAPPEN TO YOU. YOU KNOW SERVICE MORE STUDENTS WITH A DECREASE IN FNDING SO THAT THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT REALLY NEEDS TO BE EXAMINED IN TERMS OF. OF HOW THAT EIGHTY SIX SO TO FINDING IS. IS ORGANIZED IN THAT MANNER THAT'S ONE AREA ANOTHER AREA REALLY ISN'T ONE MORE TIME I JUST SECOND. OKAY SO IF YOU HAVE LET'S SAY YOU HAVE YOU GET AD A. YOU KNOW LAST YEAR FOR A THOUSAND STUDENTS AND THEN YOU GET. TEN DOLLARS IN SPECIAL EDUCATION FUNDING FOR EACH ONE OF THOSE THOUSAND STUDENTS. OKAY AND AND AND YOU HAVE. TWENTY SPECIAL EDUCATION STUDENTS. SO THE FOLLOWING YEAR LET'S SAY THIS YEAR. I HAVE NINE HUNDRED. TOTAL STUDENTS BUT I HAVE. TWENTY FIVE SPECIAL EDUCATION STUDENTS SO NOW I HAVE LESS FUNDING. BECAUSE MY TOTAL ENROLLMENT WENT DOWN BUT I HAVE AN INCREASED ABOUT A SPECIAL EDUCATION STUDENTS SO I HAVE LESS MONEY FOR ME TO WRITE HALF JUST PROVIDE SERVICES FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION STUDENTS. THAT'S A REAL ISSUE BECAUSE WE HAVE DECLINING ROLE IN IN A STATEWIDE RIGHT BUT WE HAVE INCREASING SPECIAL EDUCATION ENROLLMENT. SO SO THE INDIA IS SO THAT I THINK IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST THINGS HAT REALLY NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED THAT AND JUST YOU KNOW EQUALIZING THE FUNDING STATEWIDE YOU KNOW FOR ALL THE DIFFERENT. FOR ALL THE DIFFERENT SELFLESS IS IS REALLY YOU KNOW SOMETHING THAT REALLY NEEDS TO BE DONE. AND ALSO WE YOU KNOW WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS BEFORE LOOKING BACKWARD OUT EVEN FUNDED TO WHAT WE ARE FINDING TWO THOUSAND SEVEN SO THAT I MEAN YOU KNOW THAT. SO THERE'S THREE THINGS RIGHT HERE THAT WE COULD TALK ABOUT IT COULD BE ADDRESSED ALL THAT GOES WITHOUT SAYING TOTALLY AND I THINK. THAT MESSAGE IS REALLY LOUD AND CLEAR. BUT TO JUST KIND OF ZERO IN ON THIS. ISSUE OF THE NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT REFORMS EIGHTY SIX OR TWO ON. YOU KNOW I I I THINK I DO WE ABSOLUTELY WOULD LOVE TO CREATE A SYSTEM THAT WOULD. BE MORE REFLECTIVE OF THE TRUE COSTS. THAT ARE BORNE BY THE SCHOOLS TO PROVIDE HIGH QUALITY EDUCATION FOR THESE STUDENTS. YOU KNOW HOW DO WE AND AND MAYBE DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER FOR ME TODAY BUT IF YOU KNOW. IF YOU DON'T I LOVE YOU TO GO BACK. TO YOUR RESPECTIVE ORGANIZATIONS SMALL DISTRICTS ACCESS CALLASPO CT A CSE. SUPPER ORGANIZATIONS WHATEVER ORGANIZATION MAY BE AND SAY HEY YOU KNOW HOW DO WE HOW DO WE LEARN. HOW DO WE HOW WE IMPROVE THE SYSTEM TO MAKE IT MORE EQUITABLE WHILE? UNDERSTANDING AND AVOIDING THE CHALLENGES THAT LD TO THE REFORMS IN NINETY EIGHT IN THE FIRST PLACE FROM BEFORE. SO. I I THINK BEFORE THE WAY IT WAS WORKED WAS BASED UPON THE AMOUNT OF STUDENTS THAT WERE AN STC CLASSES EVERYONE REALLY IS PUSHING TOWARDS THE LEAST RESTRICTIVE ENVIRONMENT RIGHT NOW. SO THE IDEA ISN'T NECESSARILY THAT WE'RE GOING TO. HAVE A FORMULA THAT REFLECTS THAT WEEK STUDENTS ARE CURRENTLY BEING FOUND ELIGIBLE FOR AUTISM AND THERE'S NO INCENTIVE FOR THAT AND HERE HE FOUND ELIGIBLE AT A HIGHER LEVEL. YET THE STUDENTS YOU KNOW HAVE ARE SEVERELY IMPACTED NEED A HIGHER LEVEL OF SUPPORT SO KIND OF THAT ARGUMENT TO ME RIGHT NOW. DOESN'T REALLY A. DOESN'T MEAN IT'S NOT REALLY HOLDING TRUE FOR RIGHT NOW BEGIN THEN WHY WOULDN'T WE YOU KNOW. FIVE ANALOGY BELOW SOMETHING ELSE WHERE WE YOU KNOW WHEN COSTS AS MUCH MONEY AS YOU KNOW IT DOESN'T REALLY MAKE SENTENCES POINT. FOR THE STUDENTS THAT WE ARE FINE BECAUSE WE'RE FINDING THAT GROUP OF STUDENTS TO BE ELIGIBLE SAID AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'RE NOT GETTING ANY MORE FUNDING FOR. SO. RIGHT IS THAT MAKE DOES THAT MAKE SENSE WHEN I'M SAYING YES THE PROBLEM BEFORE I I GUESS WAS THAT. I MEAN IF YOU KNOW THE TOTAL GROSS GENERALIZATION BUT BUT THE ARGUMENTS WHILE THESE DISTRICTS ARE JUST. THEY HAVE SUCH AN INCENTIVE TO DIAGNOSE EVERYBODY IN THEIR MOTHER BECAUSE THEY'RE GETTING ALL THIS EXTRA MONEY ASSOCIATED WITH IT. NOW YOU KNOW THAT WAS THE J. FIFTY GOING INTO THIS ALPHA RIGHT NOW BUT YOU'RE I THOUGHT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. THE MIDDLE ONE WHERE IT WAS GETTING RID OF THEM THE ORIGINAL AND THEN GOING TO NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT. SO SO. YOU KNOW I I I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT REALLY NEEDS TO BE LOOKED AT IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW. NOT JUST THAT BASE AMOUNT YOU KNOW FOR STUDENT BUT WE REALLY DO NEED TO LOOK AT HOW DO WE FIND. ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR STUDENTS WITH SIGNIFICANT DISABILITIES BECAUSE WE DO HAVE AS WE KNOW RIGHT NOW IN INCREASE IN THOSE STUDENTS JUST OVERALL WITHOUT LOOKING AT ANYTHING THOUGH. YOU KNOW I DON'T PUT BY. AND. BY I REALLY DO YOU ASK FOR INPUT FROM YOUR FOLKS IN YOU AND YOU KNOW I UNDERSTAND YOU YOU MAY NOT HAVE THE ANSWERS RIGHT NOW. BECAUSE W'RE YOU KNOW AND REALLY WITH A MIND TOWARD THE MACRO. CHALLENGES THAT WE'RE DISCUSSING HERE TODAY MISS CHRIST. I DON'T KNOW THE PROTOCOL THAT WE JUST CAN'T SAY WITH THE INCREASES THAT SHE WAS DESCRIBING EVEN THOUGH IT'S DECLINING ENROLLMENT I WORK IN A RAPIDLY FAST GROWING DISTRICT OPENING IN SCHOOL A YEAR ON AVERAGE A CAPACITY. AND YOU HAVE TO HAVE SPECIAL ED TEACHERS TO WORK IN THE NINETEEN YEARS I WORKED IN SPECIAL AT. THE REQUIREMENTS TO BE A SPECIAL ED TEACHER HAVE CHANGED TENFOLD EVERYDAY THERE'S A NEW AUTHORIZATION THERE'S A NEW TEST THERE'S A NEW. COURSE NOBODY WANTS TO GO INTO THIS JOB SO I THINK FIGURING OUT WAYS. TO FIND. WAYS TO ANSWER THE TEACHER SHORTAGE. FOR SPECIAL ED. IN WITH THE ARM FUNDING. REQUIREMENTS OUR CHALLENGE AS WELL THAT I THINK NEED TO BE BROUGHT INTO THE CONVERSATION TOTALLY FORGIVE ME IF I'M BIRD WALKING BUT. I THINK THAT'S A HUGE CRITERION HUGE FACTOR IN THIS. YEAH. YEAH A LOT OF CHALLENGES YES. THE ONLY MEMBER MCCARTY YES ME JUMP IN THIS AS WELL THOUGHT I KNOW THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF THAT DISCONNECT SO WHEN MR PORN TINO ASKED WHO WHAT TO PUT THE MONEY PEACE AND LCF EFFORT OR KEEP IT IN SIX OR TWO AND FUNDED PROPERLY AND. HAVE EQUALIZE THAT SEEMS TO BE. THE DIRECTION AND PARTIALLY BECAUSE THERE'S GOOD POLICY CHANGES. THAT THAT WERE IN THERE AND. YOU KNOW MAINSTREAMING THE KIDS AND AND AND ALL THE OTHER PIECES TO THAT AND YOU SHAKE YOUR HEAD BUT I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND. WHY WE WOULD KEEP THE FAITH THE SAME FUNDING MODEL? IN OTHER WORDS YOU'RE CRACKS IS IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE IF YOU HAVE A DECLINING ENROLLMENT. A SCHOOL A SCHOOL LIKE WE HAVE ALL ACROSS CALIFORNIA AND WE'RE SHOWING THERE IS IT INCREASE IN SPECIAL ED POPULATION THAT THAT'S THE POT OF DOLLAR GOING TO SERVE THESE KIDS GOES DOWN. SO THEN. WHY WOULDN'T YOU YOU KNOW HAVE SOME TYPE OF ELSE IF THAT FUNDING FOR IT AND YOU GIVE THE DISTRICT'S MONEY BASED UPON WHO THEY SERVE LIKE WE DO WITH? YOU KNOW THE UNDUE PLACATE ACCOUNT WE CAN KEEP THE SAME POLICIES IN PLACE. BUT FOCUSING ON THE ACTUAL DOLLARS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEIR SON FAIRNESS SO WHY WOULDN'T WE DO THAT IT SEEMS. SO LOGICAL MET ONE OF MY MISSING HERE. I THINK WHAT SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN SAYING IS A QUICK FIX IS AT LEAST FUND. WHEN WE HAVE AN INCREASE IN SPECIAL ED AND A DECREASE IN ROME AND WE SHOULD CONTINUE TO GET THAT EIGHTY SIX SO TO FUNDING AND LIKE IT A LOT WHAT WHAT WHAT WE JUST GO ALL THE WAY. BY WOULDN'T YOU JUST FIND NOT BASED UPON HOW MANY STUDENTS YOU HAVE IN THE DISTRICT BUT HOW MANY STUDENTS YOU HAVE. IN IN THIS. DISABILITY BUT THIS POPULATION IN THE I THINK THAT IF YOU START FROM SCRATCH IF WE HAD. STARTED BUILDING OUR SYSTEM RIGHT HERE ON THIS TABLE I WOULD THINK YOU WOULD DO IT THAT WAY RATHER THAN THIS. BACKWARDS WAY SO WHAT'S A COUPLE WHAT WHY ARE WE MIGHT MAYBE THIS IS LA ON FINANCE QUESTION FOR OUR. BUDGET HEARING BUT WHY ARE WE DOING THAT. WELL I THINK. IF WE LOOK AT THE TRUE COST OF SPECIAL ED THAT'S THAT'S BIG. AND SO WE CERTAINLY SHOULD HAVE THOSE ASPIRATIONAL GOALS TO FUND THE TRUE COST OF ALL OF THE DISABILITIES AND HOW THOSE. CONTINUE TO RISE EACH YEAR BUT FINDING A FUNDING SOURCE THAT ADDRESSES THE MORE. EXPENSIVE OR MORE CHALLENGING MORE. STAFF INTENSE DISABILITIES AT A HIGHER LEVEL MEAN I THINK WE'RE OPEN TO. MORE FUNDING TO HELP OUR KIDS. AND WHATEVER THAT TAKES BUT AM I DO THINK WE NEED A LITTLE MORE WORK ON PROVIDING. WHAT DOES THAT? ASPIRATIONAL FUNDING MODEL LOOK LIKE. THE DISSENTING OPINION THE ROOF FELT LIKE IT SHOULD BE NOW SEE A FAT BUT I MEAN I AGREE SIX OF TWO MAY HAVE. POSITION HOWEVER. AGAIN SPECIAL HAS TO BE PART OF THE MAINSTREAM AND I WOULD LOOK AT THE FUNDING FORMULA DIFFERENT YOU KNOW BE LOOKING AT UNDER PUT ON DUPLICATE ACCOUNTS. WITH SPECIAL ED. I WOULD. BUT THAT AS A DUPLICATE ACCOUNTS SO IT IS. ETERNAL LOOK AT THAT THOSE NUMBERS EVEN YOU HAVE ENGLISH LEARNERS THEY'RE STILL THEY WILL RECEIVE AN EXTRA AMOUNT SO JUST LOOKING AT. THAT FORMULA DIFFERENTLY UNDER THE LENS OF SPECIAL LET ME BE SOMETHING TO LOOK AT. BECAUSE YOU REALLY I I TRULY BELIEVE IT NEEDS TO BE INTEGRATED WITHIN THE WHOLE. INSTRUCTIONAL PROGRAM YEAH UP TO THIS BUT THERE'S TWO THERE'S TWO THINGS ARE EVALUATING YOU KNOW IT. THIS THIS STUDENT'S NEEDS AND WHAT'S THE BEST OUTCOMES FOR THE POPULATION WERE TRYING TO HELP IN. MAINSTREAM INTEGRATION. THAT'S HOW FAR CONVERSATION AND HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT WE FIND YOU FOR THE WORK THAT YOU'RE DOING IT SOUND DISTRICTS. I HAVE SOME LEGACY OF PREPARATION THAT THEY'RE GETTING A LITTLE BUMP RIGHT NOW AND THINK PROBABLY USE THAT MONEY TO TAKE CARE OF ALL THEIR OTHER NEEDS WHICH YOU GUYS HAVE IN YOUR DISTRICTS AND. BUT DOESN'T THAT SAY MAKES THE MOST SENSE FOR STATEWIDE ALLOCATION. AND. OKAY THANK YOU. MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT CALL REALLY OF NECESSITY. THANK YOU. SO WHETHER THINGS THAT THAT SEEMS TO COME UP A LOT WE HEARD IT FROM THE ALLEY OF PRESENTATION WE ALSO. AND SOME OF THE OTHER POLICY. IF THEY KEEP SAYING THAT WELL WHAT WE'RE WORRIED ABOUT IS WE ACTUALLY PAY FOR THE NEED WE'RE JUST GONNA SET OF EYES MORE PEOPLE MARKETS MOVING IN THE SPECIAL ED AND ALSO IT MEANS IT WAS LIKE THE MAINSTREAM. I I I I I WANNA GIVE YOU ENOUGH TO TO RESPOND TO THAT FREQUENTLY MADE COMMENTS. WE ALREADY HEARD IT HERE IN THIS HEARING AT HER SCENE IN POLICY PAPERS. MY TWO I'D APPRECIATE YOUR THOUGHTS AND AND AND AND AND THE SPONSOR TO TO TO TO THAT CONCERNED IT SEEMS TO BE RES FREQUENTLY. I DON'T SEE FUNDING OF A DISABILITY. AS AN INCENTIVE TO KEEP A CHILD IN SPECIAL EDUCATION. EDUCATORS ARE HERE TO ENSURE THAT OUR STUDENTS ARE SUCCESSFUL IN THE LEAST RESTRICTIVE ENVIRONMENT. NOW THAT MAY BE MORE INTENSIVE CARE AT FIRST AS WE BEGAN TO. TRANSITION THEM INTO A LEAST RESTRICTIVE ENVIRONMENT. BUT I DON'T KNOW OF ANY BUSINESS OR SUPERINTENDENT OR EDUCATOR. THAT LOOKS TO IDENTIFY STUDENTS SO THEY CAN GET MORE MONEY. I'VE SEEN AN INCREASED AND DIVERSIONS TO SPECIAL ACT THROUGH THE MTS LASTS ROLLOUT AND THE. RESPONSE TO INTERVENTION SIR IN SOME WAYS OFFSETTING STUDENTS FROM GETTING THE SERVICES THEY NEED. BUT NOT THE OF HER IDENTIFYING AND PAYING FOR THE SERVICES. ANYONE ELSE WITH HER THOUGHTS. WELL BEING A MOTHER YOU KNOW MY SON WAS A GIVEN OUT ELECTRONIC DEVICE. BECAUSE. HE IS LEARNING BUT WE DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH HE'S LEARNING IN THE CLASSROOM. AND. WE'RE GOING THROUGH THE TRANSITION OF MAYBE GETTING A ONE ONE EIGHH WHICH OF THE DISTRICT IS NOT REALLY WANTING TO. GIVE ORDER BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE THE FUNDING. AND IT WILL REQUIRE HE'S MAINSTREAM THIRTEEN UM AT LEAST TWO HOURS OF THE DAY. SO HE GOES TO SPECIAL ED CLASSROOM AND THEN GOING TO MAINSTREAM. BUT. SO THAT COMES AGAIN TO DO THIS. BASICALLY WHAT WE HAVE BEEN DISCUSSING ABOUT THE FINDING AND I'M. HAVING THE ABILITY TO MAYBE. AS A LIBERATING THEM. LEARNING FOR THE STUDENT. FROM. AND I I THINK THAT THE INCENTIVE IS SIMPLY NOT THERE IN IN THE SENSE THAT THE IT PETER RACKS THAT IT WANTS. GOALS TO BE MET AND GROWTH TO BE MADE. OUR OWN DASHBOARD SAYS THAT WE NEED TO MAKE A SO THAT THERE IS ABSOLUTELY ZERO INCENTIVE FOR KEEPING A CHILD. AT A POOR LEVEL OF FUNCTIONING. BE IT ACADEMICALLY SOCIALLY AT ANY LEVEL SO I I DON'T THINK THAT THAT'S THE. I DON'T THINK THERE'S A DAY I WOULD HATE TO THINK THAT THERE IS A DISTRICT OR. AND EDUCATOR. TAKING ADVANTAGE OF SOMETHING LIKE THAT. I THINK WE'RE MORE PROFESSIONAL THAN THAT. WELL I THINK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR SPONSOR A DO SHARE YOUR CONCERNS AS WELL I THINK. SOMETIMES I WONDER IF THAT SIMPLY AN EXCUSE TO PREVENT. US FROM PUTTING IN THE RESOURCES WE NEED TO MEET THE NEEDS SO THANK YOU. WELL. GREAT DISCRETION LOTS MORE FOLLOW UP I REALLY DO MEAN IT WHEN I SAY THAT WE LOVE YOU TO. GO BACK TO YOUR VARIOUS FOLKS AND I KNOW WE'VE GOT PEOPLE HERE ALSO FROM. AS HERE YOU FOLKS FROM THE CHARTER SCHOOL CESSATION FOLKS FROM THE CALIFORNIA FEDERATION OF TEACHERS. FOLKS FROM CALIFORNIA SCHOOL BOARDS ASSOCIATION AND SOME OF THE FOLKS FROM THE FROM THE SPECIAL EDUCATION ADVOCACY COMMUNITY AND WE REALLY ARE LOOKING FOR. HELP IN TRYING TO GET OUR HEADS AROUND THESE THESE KIND OF. GREAT CHALLENGES AS WE TRY TO CRAFT. A MORE EQUITABLE SYSTEM THAT WORKS BETTER FOR EVERYBODY SO AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR PARTICIPATION TODAY BUT THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING. I WILL BE CALLING ON YOU SO THANK YOU BYE. ALL RIGHT NOW WE'RE GONNA BE HEARING A PERSPECTIVE FROM THE STATE YOU KNOW THE CENTER CENTER MORE LOCK ASKED ABOUT DIFFERENT A FINANCE WE WILL BE HEARING. TODAY FRONT APARTMENT OCCASION. AND ALSO STATEWIDE SPECIAL EDUCATION TASK FORCES WE'VE GOT MAUREEN FOR NASA CO EXECUTOR ACTOR FOR THE STATEWIDE SPECIAL EDUCATION TASK FORCE. AND ALSO KRISTEN WRITERS DIRECTORS MASOCHISTIC EDUCATION DIVISION. FROM THE COMFORT OF HER MEDICATION AND WE WERE VERY MUCH LOOKING FORWARD TO THEIR PERSPECTIVES FROM THE STATE. AND CERTAINLY A FASTER MORE LIKE A STILL IN THE BUILDING I'M SURE HE'D ENJOY COMING BACK IN HEARING FROM. OUTSIDE THESE TWO STATEWIDE PERSPECTIVE SO WE'LL START. WITH THAT MISS AMBER NESS. SO MUCH. IN THE IN THE FIRST PLACE I ABSOLUTELY WANT TO THANK YOU JUST SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE AND FOR ACTUALLY TAKING US. US BEING SPECIAL ED FROM THAT BACK FORTY TWO THIS LEVEL OF HEARING. IT IS SO WONDERFUL TO HAVE THIS KIND OF LOOK AT WHAT A GREAT NEED THIS IS MY HOPE. AND I DO NEED TO SAY THAT VICKY WAS NOT ABLE TO MAKE IT TODAY SHE WAS BY ACOG SECT OF DIRECTOR ON THE TASK FORCE AND HER HUSBAND HAS BEEN HOSPITALIZED SO SHE'S VERY SORRY. BUT THE HANDOUT THAT YOU'LL GET FROM US HAS BOTH OF OUR CONTACT INFORMATION AND OUR COMMITMENT TO YOU IS THAT WE WILL BE ANY KIND OF FOLLOW UP HELP FOR YOU IN ANY FURTHER CONVERSATION. OF WHICH WERE VERY CLEARLY INDICATED FROM TODAY THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE MORE. JUST JUST TO HELP CLARIFY SOME THINGS. SO I WAS ABLE TO BE PART OF THE AB SIX OH TWO CONVERSATIONS AND I THOUGHT A LITTLE BIT OF HISTORY. GOING INTO THIS US SPECIAL ED FINANCE WOULD HELP. IN NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN WHEN AB SIX OH TWO WAS WRITTEN. IT WAS TOO ADDI INCENTIVIZE THE THE PAST AND IT WAS TO EQUALIZE THE DIFFERENCES SO YOU'VE HEARD SOME REFERENCE TO THE FACT THAT DISTRICTS WERE FUNDED SO DIFFERENTLY AND IT WAS ACTUALLY. UNITS OF FUNDING TEACHERS AND AIDES DEPENDING ON HOW IT IS THAT YOU DID WHAT YOU DID. AND WHAT YOUR SUPPORT SERVICE RATIO WAS IT WAS A VERY COMPLEX FORMULA AND IT DIFFERED THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND IT BECAME SO UNEQUAL THAT DISTRICTS JUST LIKE YOU'VE HEARD TODAY WERE TELLING THE LEGISLATURE. THIS ISN'T FAIR THIS IS A REASONABLE WE NEED TO CHANGE IT. AND SO THERE WAS A VERY LONG CONVOLUTED CONVERSATION TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WOULD BE A GOOD WAY TO DO THIS. SO WE DID LOOK AT D. INCENTIVIZING. AND THE ISSUE WAS THAT IF WE WENT TO AN EIGHTY EIGHT BASED MODEL THEN ALL OF THOSE DIFFERENCES ACROSS THE STATE. COULD BE KIND OF AVERAGED OUT. BUT YOU STILL HAD TO DO YOUR AVERAGING FROM THIS UNEQUAL POINT. AND SO THE IDEA OF. COMING TO AN EIGHTY A BASIS BUT OVER TIME EQUALIZING THOSE RATES UP WAS THE SOLUTION AT THE TIME AND SO SEE THE PROBLEM IS WE'VE STILL NEVER GOTTEN THERE. AND THAT'S WHY EQUALIZATION WAS MENTIONED BY SO MANY PEOPLE NOW BECAUSE IF MY EIGHTY YEAR RATE IS FOUR HUNDRED AND SIXTY DOLLARS IN YEARS IS SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS. IT'S NOT FAIR SO THE EQUALIZATION ISSUE IS JUST ABSOLUTELY ONE OF THE MOST CRITICAL ARM. ISSUES OF CONTINUATION. BUT THE OTHER WAS THAT WE DID GO TO A K. TWELVE EIGHTY A MODEL AND WE'RE RESPONSIBLE IN SPECIAL ED FROM BIRTH. TO TWENTY TWO SO WE HAVE STUDENTS WHO DON'T GET A REGULAR HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA WHO NEED TRANSITION SERVICES WHO NEED SERVICES. TO BECOME THE MOST PRODUCTIVE CITIZENS THEY CAN BE AND WE HAVE THIS BURGEONING PRESCHOOL POPULATION THAT HAS JUST EXPLODED ACROSS. THE STATE AND SO OUT OF OUR K. TWELVE EIGHTY A WERE SUPPOSED TO BE COVERING THIS ENTIRE RANGE OF SERVICES. SO I JUST WANTED TO MAKE THOSE PARTICULAR POINTS THAT HERE WE HAVE THESE HUGE INCREASES IN IN US STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES. AND REALLY THE ISSUE THAT IS MOST UNREASONABLE ABOUT EIGHTY SIX SO TOO IS THAT IT IS ONLY KATE TWELVE DOESN'T INCLUDE PRESCHOOL DOESN'T INCLUDE TRANSITION AGE. AND IT IS STILL UNEQUAL IN IT SARAH IN ITS RATES ACROSS THE DISTRICT. SO THE THE SHEEP THAT WE HAVE PROVIDED FOR YOU. ACTUALLY TWO YEARS THREE YEARS AGO NOW WE PROVIDED EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOU LEGISLATORS SENATOR PAN IS MY CENTER THANK YOU AND. KEVIN MCCARTY IS MY ASSEMBLYMAN EACH OFFICE GOT ONE OF OUR REPORTS AND SO I KNOW YOU HAVE SOMEWHERE IN YOUR HISTORY. THE ENTIRE REPORT AND WHEN DICK AND I PRESENTED THIS WE SAID WE DON'T WANT THIS TO BE A REPORT THAT WILL SIT ON YOUR SHELVES WHAT WE WANT IS THAT FOR THIS TO BE A CALL TO ACTION. AND I AM DELIGHTED TO SAY THAT SO MANY THINGS HAVE HAPPENED. SINCE THIS REPORT HAS COME OUT SO. OF THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION FOR EXAMPLE HAVE ESPECIALLY WITH KRISTEN'S LEADERSHIP THERE AND AND GLENN PRICE. AND TOM TRUCKS THAT HAVE REALLY TAKEN THE WHOLE ISSUE OF ONE'S SYSTEM AS A MODEL. IN OUR DISTRICTS ARE FOLLOWING THAT ISSUE TRYING TO GET KIDS MORE INCLUDED AND I AM. AND THAT-WHOLE ONE SYSTEM IDEAS FABULOUS ART COMMISSION ON TEACHER CREDENTIALING HAS REVAMPED THE GENERAL ED ODD CREDENTIAL IN IS IN THE PROCESS OF REVAMPING THE SPECIAL ED CREDENTIAL. WE DO HAVE MORE M. TSS ACROSS THE STATE WE HAVE GREAT MENTAL% HEALTH MODELS. OF MEN THAT WERE RECOMMENDED FROM OUR BEST PRACTICES A LOT OF THE ASSESSMENT ACCOUNTABILITY PIECES. HAVE BEEN TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT. BUT. THE LEGISLATURE HAS NOT SINCE THAT TWO THOUSAND SEVEN BUDGET CUT. DONE AUGHT ANYTHING OF SIGNIFICANCE IN THE AREA OF SPECIAL ED FUNDING. AND I NEED TO AY THAT WHEN MY CURSED ASKED US TO START THIS PROCESS WHICH IS NOW. SIX YEARS AGO HE SAID WE ARE JUST BEGINNING L. CFF WE ARE JUST BEGINNING EL CAP. DON'T MESS WITH SPECIAL ED FUNDING IN THE EL CAP YET. SO THAT'S REALLY WHERE THAT CAME FROM SO WE LOOKED AT THE WHOLE PICTURE ABOUT WELL WHAT IS SPECIAL AND FINDING WHAT CAN WE RECOMMEND. TO THE LEGISLATURE SO WE HAVE THIS WHOLE LIST. OF IDEAS. AND. AND I WISH THAT SOMEONE MCCARTY WERE STILL HERE BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK AT THAT EIGHTY A RATE. REALLY THE IDEA OF LCF I WAS THAT EVERYBODY GETS AN EIGHTY A RATE. AND SO OUR WHOLE POINT IS THAT ARE ADA RATES IN SPECIAL ED ARE UNEQUAL. IF YOU WERE TO DO ANY KIND OF MODEL THAT SAYS LET'S EQUALIZE THAT'S WHERE THE FIXES. AND I DO BELIEVE THAT IT IS IMPORTANT TO CONTINUE TO PROTECT SPECIAL ED FUNDING AS SPECIAL ED FUNDING IT'S AN ENTITLEMENT. FROM FEDERAL LAW IT IS THAT WHICH GUARANTEES THAT WE PROVIDE THE SERVICES TO OUR STUDENTS. AND SO I THINK THAT IS THE THE BIGGEST SOLUTION AND YOU WILL SEE. IN OUR LIST OF RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WAS NUMBER ONE. IT WAS NUMBER ONE THREE YEARS AGO IT'S NUMBER ONE. TODAY BECAUSE IT IS PROBABLY THE MOST CRITICAL AND IT'S BECAUSE OF EVERYTHING THAT YOU'VE ALREADY HEARD THIS MORNING SO I WON'T GO INTO. THOSE DIFFERENCES IN RATES AGAIN. OUT BUT THE SECOND ONE IS THIS ENSURING THE AVAILABILITY OF EARLY INTERVENTION PROGRAMS AND SERVICES AND I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU SENATOR ALAN FOR ALL THAT YOU'VE ALREADY DONE IN THAT REGARD WE APPRECIATE ALL YOUR EFFORTS. PRESCHOOL NUMBERS HAVE INCREASED SO DRAMATICALLY AND THE NEEDS OF THE STUDENTS HAVE INCREASED AND THERE ISN'T. ANYWHERE NEAR THE ADEQUATE FUNDING TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES AND IT DOES COME FROM THE K. TWELVE FUNDING. IN ORDER TO PROVIDE IT AT THE PRE SCHOOL LEVEL. AND SO THAT IT THAT IS DEFINITELY OUR SECOND. THE THIRD RECOMMENDATION ABOUT FUNDING SELF IS BASED ON EIGHTY EIGHT GOES BACK TO THE ADVOCACY ISSUE THAT HAS ALSO BEEN BROUGHT UP. BY SEVERAL OTHER PEOPLE HERE. AND YOU'VE ALSO HEARD DISCUSSION ALREADY ABOUT THE THE ISSUE OF GROWTH AND DECLINE SO BY MYSELF BUT I HAVE ONE OF MY DISTRICTS LOSES A HUNDREDSTUDENTS. BUT ANOTHER GROWS A HUNDRED IN GETTING THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING BUT HERE YOU ARE THIS DISTRICT WITH ONE HUNDRED MORE STUDENTS TO SERVE. AND SO THAT THAT HAS ALWAYS BEEN. AN ISSUE AND HAS CONTINUED TO BE. ARE WE REALLY ARE AT NUMBER FIVE WAS TO ENSURE THAT WE INCREASE OUR THAT WE CONTINUE. AS SOME DOLLARS THAT HAVE BEEN PROTECTED LIKE NECESSARY SMALL SABAS. THE EDUCATION RELATED MENTAL HEALTH CARE SERVICES. AND AT THE TIME WE RECOMMENDED THIS OUT OF HOME CARE FUNDING FOR FOSTER YOUTH IN THE MEANTIME THIS LEGISLATURE'S CHANGE THE WHOLE FOSTER YOUTH PLACEMENT AND A GROUP HOME ISSUE. SO THAT IS AN ISSUE THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO REALLY READ ADDRESS AS UP FOSTER HOMES AND STR TEEPEES CHANGE AS WELL. WITH IN THAT I DIDN'T SPECIFICALLY NOTE ON YOUR PAPER BUT IN OUR FAMILY ENGAGEMENT SECTION. WE HAD RECOMMENDED FULLY FUNDING FAMILY EMPOWERMENT CENTERS AND I THINK YOU HEARD A VERY. IMPASSIONED PLEAS THAT ALL PARENTS DESERVE THE OPPORTUNITIES OUGHT TO HAVE A FAMILY EMPOWERMENT CENTER. AND SO THAT WAS ALSO ONE OF OUR RECOMMENDATIONS. I WILL SAY THAT OUR RECOMMENDATION NUMBER SIX ABOUT UPDATING ELECTRONIC DATA SYSTEMS HAS IN FACT BEEN WELL ADDRESSED BY THE DPARTMENT OF EDUCATIONAL READY WE HAVE MUCH BETTER COORDINATION. AND A AND THAT IS CONTINUING. TO BE IMPROVED. AS LOW INCIDENCE FUNDING WAS MENTIONED EARLIER AND AND OUR SEVENTH RECOMMENDATION WAS ABOUT INCREASING THAT BUT CHANGING THE DEFINITION TO THE FEDERAL DEFINITION. BECAUSE THERE ARE IF YOU USE THE FEDERAL DEFINITION THERE ARE MORE STUDENTS. WHO WOULD THEN BE ELIGIBLE FOR THE FUNDING BUT YOU'VE ALSO HEARD HOW INADEQUATE THAT LEVEL OF FUNDING AT LESS THAN FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR STUDENTS WHO MIGHT REQUIRE? TEN OR TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS WORTH OF SERVICES IN A YEAR. WE ALSO RECOMMENDED THAT. WORKABILITY B. AN OPPORTUNITY THAT IS AVAILABLE FOR ALL OF OUR STUDENTS WHO WERE OF HIGH SCHOOL AGE. AND GIVEN THAT ONE OF OUR BIGGEST. ASSIGNMENTS IN THE TASK FORCE WORK WAS THAT WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO INCREASE OUTCOMES% FOR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES WORKABILITY IS THE ONE PROGRAM THAT LETS US A DOCUMENT OR ACCOUNTABILITY AND ALLOWS ALL STUDENTS AND HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE SOME KIND OF. MEANING INTO THE AGE OF TWENTY TWO. YOU HEARD FROM ONE OF THE SUPERINTENDENTS ABOUT TRANSPORTATION COSTS BEING SO IMPORTANT THAT IS INCREDIBLY EXPENSIVE PARTICULARLY IN A SMALL RURAL OR. LARGER COUNTIES AND THAT'S IT. WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMENDED THAT THAT BE INCREASED. I WOULD LIKE TO SAY AND THINK YOU ARE TO LEGISLATOR FOR NUMBER TEN WE ASKED THAT ALL SUPPOSED TO HAVE ADR GRANTS AND IN FACT THAT HAS BEEN. THE ONE FISCAL. RESPONSE THAT OUR LEGISLATURE HAS GIVEN US AT ABOUT FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS TO EACH CELL BY THAT THAT IS A GREAT WAY TO HELP WITH. A WORKING RELATIONS WITH PARENTS. AND THEN WE HAVE SEVERAL DIFFERENT A COUPLE DIFFERENT IDEAS HERE ABOUT FACILITIES INCLUDING A SERVICES FOR. FROM BIRTH ALL THE WAY TO TWENTY TWO. AND THEN THERE ARE THREE RECOMMENDATIONS AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL AND TO THE OF THIS ISSUE OF FORTY PERCENT IS IS ONE THAT OUR LEGISLATURE HERE IN CALIFORNIA HAS FREQUENTLY ACTUALLY ADOPTED A JOINT RESOLUTION. THAT HAS GONE TO CONGRESS TO SAY. IT SURE WOULD HELP IF YOU WOULD COME THROUGH WITH WHAT YOU SAID IN THE ORIGINAL ID A. THERE HAVE BEEN BILLS PASSED AND BROUGHT FORWARD EVERY YEAR THAT SAY PLEASE GET THAT FUNDING TO FORTY PERCENT IT WOULD MAKE SUCH A DIFFERENCE TO EVERY STATE BUT PARTICULARLY TO CALIFORNIA. AND. SO THAT'S ONE THING THAT WE COULD DO IT IS UP TO CONGRESS. BUT AT LEAST THIS LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER ADOPTING A RESOLUTION. AND THEN AS YOU HAD MENTIONED SENATOR PAT ANOTHER OF OUR RECOMMENDATIONS IS ABOUT. GETTING RID OF THOSE BARRIERS TO MEDICAL AND I ELLIE A. FANS. AND THEN THERE'S ONE OUT ONE LAST ONE ABOUT ENSURING THAT ALL OF OUR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES STILL HAVE THE RIGHTS TO. FEDERAL SCHOLARSHIP OPPORTUNITIES AND AND THAT WAS CHANGED FOR. AN UNREASONABLE. A CHANGE IN THE PAST. SO I DID THAT AS QUICKLY AS I COULD WANTING TO SAY SO MUCH MOREAND BECKY HAS SENT MORE TO THAT I'D BE HAPPY TO PASS ON AS WELL. BUT I ALSO KNOW WE HAVE LOTS OF INFORMATION FROM KRISTIN WHO WAS MY LIAISON AT THE STATE BOARD FOR THE TASK FORCE AND SO. THANK YOU FOR BEING BAD FOR US. APPRECIATE HAVING THESE TWO PERSPECTIVES HERE AT THE PALACE OF. CHRISTIAN RIGHT. I WOULD LIKE TO ALSO INTRODUCE HER HEATHER CARLSON WHO IS HERE TODAY. WITH THE FISCAL LANDS. I KNOW DR BARBER COULD NOT BE WITH US TODAY AND HAVE THEIR FEARS ABOUT THE KNOWLEDGE THAT THERE'S QUESTIONS ABOUT THE SPECIFIC PAPERS THAT YOU RECEIVE JUST RECENTLY. SO I I JUST WANNA DO A COUPLE EXCLAMATION MARKS IN A COUPLE CLARIFICATIONS ONE IS THAT JUST TO LET YOU KNOW SORT OF WHAT WERE MAPPING TO AS A STATE AND WORKING WITH ALL OUR ELEAZAR AND YOU GOT A GREAT FLAVOR FROM ALL OF OUR. SOME LOCALS EARLIER AND I THINK. WHAT THEY SHARED WITH YOU IS REALLY WHAT WE'RE HEARING FROM DISTRICTS AROUND THE STATE SO VERY CONSISTENT MESSAGES WITH WHAT WE ALSO HEAR? AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT. AS A STATE WE ARE LOOKING AT MORE THAN EVER IS REALLY THAT MAPPING TO EMPLOYMENT SO WE'RE WORKING ACROSS SECTORS WITH OUR DEPARTMENT OF REHABILITATION OUR EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT OUR DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES SOCIAL SERVICES HEALTH CARE. TO REALLY TRY TO ENSURE THAT EVERY SINGLE ONE OF OUR STUDENTS HAVE ACCESS TO EVERY SINGLE SKILL THAT THEY WOULD NEED IN ORDER TO GAIN EMPLOYMENT AND REALLY TO BECOME AN ACTIVE PRODUCTIVE CITIZEN WHICH IS. REALLY THE IMPETUS FOR WHY WE HAVE KIDS IN SCHOOL AND SO I JUST WANT TO REALLY HIGHLIGHT AND REITERATE. THE EARLY EDUCATION PIECE AND SO IF THERE WAS ONE THING IF THE MAGIC WAND HAPPEN IF THERE WAS ONE THING THAT REALLY. WE BELIEVE WOULD CHANGE THE TRAJECTORY FOR OUR STUDENTS IT WOULD BE THE ACCESS TO EARLY PRESCHOOL INCLUSIVE SETTINGS AND IT'S NOT JUST BECAUSE WE WANT KIDS HAVING ACCESS TO EARLY PRESCHOOL BECAUSE WE DO. IT'S ALSO BECAUSE OF WHAT HAPPENS AS A COMMUNITY. IN TERMS OF SETTING A CULTURE THAT EVERYONE BELONGS IN OUR SYSTEM AND WHAT WE SEE NOW IS WE SEE A LOT OF STUDENTS WHO START OFF IN SEGREGATED PRESCHOOL SETTINGS AND THEY NEVER LEAVE. AND SO THERE WAS A QUESTION EARLIER ABOUT NON PUBLIC SCHOOLS WERE SERVING ABOUT. OUT OF OUR SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY FOUR THOUSAND STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES IN CALIFORNIA ABOUT FIFTEEN THOUSAND OF THEM ARE SERVED IN NON PUBLIC SCHOOLS I'M TWO HUNDRED AND NINETY SIX. NON PUBLIC SCHOOLS WHICH SHOULD BE DELINEATED FROM OR DIFFERENT YOU DID FROM PRIVATE SCHOOLS. OF NON PUBLIC SCHOOLS ARE SCHOOLS THAT ARE CERTIFIED THROUGH THE STATE TO SERVE STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES AND THEY DO RECEIVE ID A FUNDS THROUGH THEIR SELF OR ELLIJAY. AND PUBLIC PRIVATE SCHOOLS ARE NOT SCHOOLS THAT WE CERTIFY IN THAT REGARD AND THEY DO NOT RECEIVE PUBLIC FUNDING. AND SO. SO IN TERMS OF IF WE'RE LOOKING AT WHAT THE BIGGEST BANG FOR OUR BUCK IS IT'S REALLY ENSURING THAT WE HAVE THOSE EARLY PRE SCHOOL SETTINGS NOT ONLY ARE YOU. CHANGING THE HEARTS AND MINDS OF THE CHILDREN THAT STARTED IN THE SETTINGS BUT I WOULD BE REMISS IF I DID NOT QUOTE MY FRIEND JOKE SAVIOR WHO'S THE DIRECTOR OF THE PROBLEM OF REHAB. WHO SAYS THAT THE BUSINESS OWNERS OF TOMORROW ARE THE PRESCHOOLERS OF TODAY THEY'RE SITTING IN THOSE PRE SCHOOL CLASSROOMS LEARNING ABOUT THE STUDENTS THAT THEY'RE WITH? AND SO WE'RE TRYING TO CREATE THIS COMMUNITY WHERE EVERYONE BELONGS BUT WE START SEGREGATING EARLY AND WE SEND SOME REAL SPECIFIC MESSAGES SO I KNOW YOU'VE HEARD A LOT OF THE OTHER LOGISTICS TODAY THERE'S A COUPLE OTHER POINTS THAT I WANTED TO MAKE JUST IN TERMS OF. OUR OWN RESPONSIBILITIES AS A AS A STATE AND AS A DEPARTMENT WITH ACCEPTING THE MORE THAN ONE BILLION DOLLARS THAT WE ACCEPT FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WERE ACCEPTING. THE RESPONSIBILITY TO ENSURE THAT STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES TO GET ACCESS TO. A FREE APPROPRIATE PUBLIC EDUCATION THE LEAST RESTRICTIVE ENVIRONMENT AND WHAT DOES THAT MEAN THAT REALLY MEANS THAT IT STARTS AS EVERY STUDENTS IN GENERAL AT STUDENT LIKE WE HEARD EARLIER. AND THAT SCHOOL STARTS WITH THEIR GENERAL ED PEERS AND YOU DON'T NEED TO TAKE IT TO GET INTO THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO EARN YOUR WAY INTO GENERAL LET EVEN IN PRESCHOOL. REALLY YOU YOU HAVE TO EARN A TICKET OUT AND THAT'S ONLY AFTER EVERY SUPPORT AND SERVICES BEEN PUT IN PLACE. THE WORD HOLDING AS A DEPARTMENT AS WE'RE DOING OUR MONITORING OR HOLDING DISTRICTS TO A MUCH HIGHER STANDARD AROUND. ENSURING THAT STUDENTS DO HAVE ACCESS TO GENERAL AND WERE BEING PUSHED IN OUR LAWSUITS FOR THE SAME THING. SO IF WE'RE GOING TO DO THAT AND WE TRULY BELIEVE IN EQUITY WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO FUND OUR DISTRICTS TO BE ABLE TO SERVE EVERY SINGLE STUDENT IN THAT LEAST RESTRICTIVE ENVIRONMENT AND FOR SOME STUDENTS. IT'S REALLY EXPENSIVE THAT MIGHT MEAN A STUDENT WITH SIGNIFICANT DISABILITIES NEEDS TO HAVE A NURSE IN THE CLASSROOM OR PARA EDUCATOR OR A LITANY OF THINGS BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN. THAT BECAUSE IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE ACCESS TO THAT CLASSROOM. AND SO I THINK WHAT WE'VE SEEN IS. ELEAZAR AND AND I DON'T I AGREE I DON'T KNOW ANYONE WHO WANTS TO SEGREGATE KIDS AND DOESN'T WANT THEM TO GET EVERYTHING THEY NEED BUT AT SOME POINT. YOU HAVE TO MAKE FISCAL CHOICES AROUND ECONOMIES OF SCALE AND THEN WE SEE THINGS LIKE SPECIAL DAY CLASSES OF KIDS FROM KINDERGARTEN THROUGH FIFTH GRADE. GOING TO SCHOOL TOGETHER WITH THE SAME TEACHER FOR MANY YEARS NOW IF WE EXPECT THEM TO BE ABLE TO. TO LEARN ALL THEIRS STATE STANDARDS AND PERFORM ON STATE LEVEL ASSESSMENTS THEY HAVE TO HAVE ACCESS TO ALL OF THAT INFORMATION AND THE STATE STANDARDS AND SO FOR ONE TEACHER. TO TEACH FIVE GRADE LEVELS EVERY YEAR. WITH ONE OR TWO AIDES AND A LOT OF KIDS WITH BEHAVIOR AND OTHER THINGS IS A PRETTY TALL ORDER. SO YOU KNOW I JUST FEEL LIKE AS A STATE WE HAVE TO WE HAVE TO DECIDE WHAT WE WANT FOR ALL OF OUR STUDENTS. WERE HERE TODAY AT THE DEPARTMENT AND IN THE SPECIAL ED DIVISION AND THE REASON I'M HERE. IS TO SUPPORT THIS AND IT'S BEEN NICE HAVING THE BACKBONE OF THE SPECIAL ATTACKS FORCE AND ALL OF YOUR SUPPORT FRANKLY ALL THE FOLKS SITTING UP HERE HAVE BEEN TREMENDOUS SUPPORTERS AROUND MAKING THIS HAPPEN. AND AGAIN IT GOES BACK TO THE EQUITY ISSUE THE FEW THINGS I'D LIKE TO ALSO POINT OUT OR THAT. OUR SUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES ARE NOT JUST STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES THERE'S THE INTERSECTION AUDI BETWEEN THEM THERE ENGLISH LEARNERS. STUDENTS IN POVERTY THEIR FOSTER YOUTH ON THEIR HOMELESS YOUTH AND THE MANY OTHER THINGS BUT IN TERMS OF THE LC FF THEY CROSS OVER ALL THOSE GROUPS. SO THEY'RE NOT INDIVIDUAL GROUPS SEVENTY PERCENT OF OUR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES ARE IN ONE OR MORE OF THE LCF CATEGORIES. SO WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT DIFFERENT KIDS SO ARE FRAMING OF HOW YOU SUPPORT WHOLE CHILDREN. IN A GENERAL ED ENVIRONMENT IS CLOSE TO GENERAL AS POSSIBLE IS SOMETHING THAT WILL COST MORE MONEY. AND IF WE EXPECT EQUITY FOR ALL OF OUR STUDENTS WE HAVE TO HAVE EQUITY ACROSS OUR ELEAZAR TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THOSE SERVICES AND THAT INCLUDES CHARTER SCHOOLS. AND THAT'S ANOTHER CLARIFICATION I WANT TO MAKE IS THAT. OF ALL OF OUR CHARTER SCHOOLS I THINK AROUND SIX HUNDRED OF THEM ARE ONES THAT ARE THEIR OWN ELLIE IS FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION SO SOME OF THEM ARE DEPENDENT ON DISTRICTS FOR THEIR SPECIAL ED SERVICES. BUT THOSE SIX HUNDRED FULL RESPONSIBILITY OF SPECIAL EDUCATION SO WE EXPECT THEM TO SERVE THE FULL RANGE OF STUDENTS JUST LIKE WITH OUR SMALL SCHOOL DISTRICT IS THE SAME CONVERSATION. IS THE MICROMETER SCALE ISSUE YOU ONLY GET. A CERTAIN AMOUNT FOR YOUR SMALL NUMBER OF STUDENTS AND THEN YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO DO A LOT OF THINGS SO WE'RE PUSHING CHARTER SCHOOLS TO SERVE TRANSITION AGE YOUTH THEY'VE NEVER DONE THAT BEFORE. AND BUT THEY GET NO FUNDING AND THEY HAVE NO ACCESS TO WORK ABILITY SO HOW DO WE EXPECT WE WANT EVERYONE TO SERVE EVERYONE AND TO SERVE EVERYONE WELL. AND SO THAT EQUITY ACROSS FISCAL IS REALLY REALLY CRITICAL AND SO I SEE SO MUCH PROMISE RIGHT NOW. OLD EVERY SINGLE PIECES LINED UP IN OUR SYSTEM. OUR POLICY MAKERS OLIVER STATE AGENCIES. COLLABORATION IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT OF WHAT'S OCCURRING ACROSS EVERYONE WITH THIS REAL WELL TO WRAP AROUND. THE REALLY THE HOW AND THE ABILITY TO DO THAT WORK WITH THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF OF MONEY IS GOING TO BE A CRITICAL PIECE OF IT ALL. SO I THINK YOU FOR LISTENING. ONE. MANY BIG. EMPLOYER ID PRE APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS A GREAT DEAL THANK YOU GUYS ABSENT A PANT. THANK YOU. ACTUALLY DID JUST WANNA TOUCH. ON BECAUSE ONE OF THINGS WE TALK ABOUT COURSES RESOURCES AND. SO WHEN AREA BECAUSE I USED TO CHAIR THE HEALTH COMMITTEE IN THE STATE ASSEMBLY IN FACT. A. CONVENED A MEETING BETWEEN. DCS AND. SEVERAL SCHOOL DISTRICT IN THE PART OF EDUCATION LOOKING AT. ONLY A AND MOM MONEY AND I KNOW WE WERE AT THAT TIME. DEALING WITH. CHALLENGE WITH CMS BUT. IT IS AS YOUR REPORT NOTED. AND THEY'VE RELEASES TO THOUSANDS AWHILE AGO BUT STILL. I DON'T THINK PRICE THESE CHANGES ESTIMATE CALIFORNIA RANKS IN THE BOTTOM QUARTILE. AND AVERAGE CLAIMS FOR MEDICAID FOR ELIGIBLE CHILDREN AMONG STATES WITH SCHOOL BASED MEDICAID PROGRAMS AND OTHERS ANY MORE RECENT DATA. AND WHETHER YOU WANT CONJECTURE WITH ACTUALLY MOVES FROM THE BOTTOM QUARTILE TO ANYWHERE ELSE BUT THE BOTTOM QUARTILE. AND THEN ASHES INTERESTING IS THERE'S A LOT OF. CONCERNED AT THAT BASICALLY SAYS ONE REASONS ARE SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE AVAILING THEMSELVES OF THESE FUNDS IS THAT THAT THE UP PAPERWORK. THE CLEANING PROCESS IS TOO DIFFICULT AND. MAYBE COMMENT ON WHAT WE CAN DO TO. TO PROVE THAT WILL STILL MEETING THE CMS ENDS OF WHY OTHER STATES ARE ABLE TO DO THIS AND WHY ARE WE NOT ABLE TO I MEAN I THINK THAT. THERE'S A TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITY. I'VE JUST JUST JUST. EVEN AT THE BOTTOM QUARTILE WE ARE. YOU KNOW GETTING ABOUT A HUNDRED THIRTY TWO HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN MILLION. IF YOU'RE IN THE TOP QUARTILE I DON'T KNOW THAT BECOME LIKE. TWO HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE HUNDRED MILLION THE I THINK. I THINK THE SCHOOLS COULD USE THAT MONEY SO THE BABY CAN COMMENT ON THAT WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING TO ADDRESS. ARE BELIEVED TO DRAW DOWN FEDERAL FUNDS THROUGHOUT THE A AND MA. THROUGH THE MEDICAID PROGRAM. BUT I WISH I HAD AN EASY ANSWER TO THAT ONE OF THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT I HAVE IS AS A MEMBER OF THE NATIONAL COUNCIL FOR ADMINISTRATORS FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION THROUGH THE COUNCIL FOR EXCEPTIONAL CHILDREN. AND SO TWICE A MONTH I'M ON A CALL WITH PEOPLE FROM AROUND THE COUNTRY. AND EVERY OTHER STATE. USES THESE MONIES TO FUND CLINICS AND THEY GET IT AND IT'S JUST PART OF THE PROCESS BUT THEY DO HAVE SOME DIFFERENT RULES. AND SO AT ONE POINT EARLY ON IN THIS DISCUSSION I REMEMBER US LOOKING INTO. I'M A COUPLE OF THE OTHER STATES DISABLED EXACTLY WHAT WHAT ARE YOUR RULES SO THAT WE CAN LOOK AT HOW DO WE DIFFER. AND SO I THINK THAT THERE MIGHT BE SOME REGULATORY CHANGES THAT COULD DO THAT BUT THEN WE ALSO HAVE A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT. BUSINESSES THAT SOME OF WHICH HAVE COME AND GONE AND I'M NOT IN THE FIELD ANYMORE SO I CAN'T GIVE YOU THE THE LATEST UPDATE. BUT I KNOW PEOPLE WOULD BE VERY WILLING TO WORK WITH YOU ON THAT BECAUSE WE'RE. EIGHTEEN PERCENT OF THE NATIONAL SPECIAL ED POPULATION. AND IN THE BOTTOM QUARTILE. THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE FOR WHAT WE COULD BE ACCESSING POTENTIALLY. WELL I JUST POINT OUT IN ADDITION TO SERVING ON THE. EDUCATION COMMITTEE ASKED THE CHAIR OF THE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE ON HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES THAT OVERSEES THE MEDICAID. OUR MEDICAL PROGRAM SO AND SO I'M VERY VERY INTERESTED IN THIS AND FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN SOLVE THIS PROBLEM. BE HAPPY TO HELP WORK WITH YOU ON THAT THANK YOU. THE QUESTIONS AND. YEAH YEAH I HAD TO STEP OUTSIDE APOLOGIZE IF IF YOU IF YOU MENTION IS WE TALKED OUR LAST TWO PANELS AS FAR AS THE THE EQUALIZATION OR. WHATNOT WHICH IS SOMETHING DIFFERENT YOU KNOW GOING BACK TO THE TWENTY YEAR MODEL JUST FINDING IT PER STUDENT SERVED. WHAT ARE YOUR IDEAS OF WHAT CALIFORNIA SHOULD DO FOR REALLY WANTED? ADDRESS THAT THE FISCAL ISSUES NOT THE NOT THE POLICY SIDE. SO ONE NIGHT. I DID ADDRESS THAT SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE YOU HAD ASKED THE QUESTION ABOUT WHAT IF WE JUST WHEN INTEL CFO. AND SO. THE COMPARISON IS THAT EVERY DISTRICT THROUGH LCF UP IS NOW GETTING AN EIGHTY EIGHT RIGHT. ANDSO WHAT IS EQUALLY TRUE IS THAT EVERY DISTRICT EVERY CELL BUT GETS A RATE ALSO FOR SPECIAL LED THE DIFFERENCE FOR US IS THAT THOSE RATES DIFFER SO SIGNIFICANTLY. SO IF YOU WERE TO SAY THAT LET'S KEEP THIS IN A SIMILAR MODEL AS LCF HALF. THE POINT WOULD BE TO EQUALIZE THOSE DOLLARS SO THAT THE ADA RATE FOR SPECIAL ED PURPOSES. COULDN'T BE PART OF THAT CONVERSATION BUT IT WOULD BE EQUALIZED BUT THE DIFFERENCE IS FRANKLY THAT BECAUSE. ID A IS AN ENTITLEMENT AND SPECIAL ED IS AN ENTITLEMENT TO PEOPLE. I BELIEVE AND I'M NOT A PARENT BUT I BELIEVE THAT THAT PROTECTION OF HAVING IT BE THE ONE REMAINING CATEGORICAL IS IMPORTANT SO THAT WE CAN MONITOR WE CAN REPORT. IS A LOT OF REPORTING REQUIREMENTS THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE THE PROTECTION BUT SHOULD WE ALSO DO THE EQUALIZATION OR FUNDED BY THE STATE THE AMOUNT OF STUDENTS ACTUALLY SIR SO THEN. SENT DISTRICTS ARE ARE GETTING A TRUE. IT OUT YET COMPENSATION OR ALLOCATION BASED UPON THE WORK THAT'S BEING DONE I THINK THERE'S A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT. RESPONSES TO THAT DURING THE EIGHTY SIX SO TO CONVERSATIONS ONE OF THE REASONS THAT THE DECISION TO GO TO AN EIGHTY A RATE ULTIMATELY. WAS BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK ACROSS THE STATE. IT LETS THEM IN FREMONT I'M GONNA HAVE A HIGHER POPULATION OF KIDS WHO ARE DEAF BECAUSE THE SCHOOL FOR THE DEAF IS RIGHT THERE. BUT IF I'M IN MODOC COUNTY I HAVE A HIGHER POPULATION OF KIDS WHO REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT TRANSPORTATION OR HEALTH OR OTHER DIFFERENT KINDS OF NEEDS IN. THE RANGE OF NEEDS IN AT THE SYSTEM AS WIDE AS OURS WITH SOME WOULD YOU SAY SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND STUDENTS IN. EIGHT STATES ACROSS THE GEOGRAPHY OF CALIFORNIA. IT IT FELT LIKE IT WAS THE FAIR THING TO DO TO AVERAGE OUT THAT ACROSS ALL THOSE SYSTEMS BECAUSE OF THE DIFFERING NEEDS. AN EIGHTY A RATE THAT WOULD GO ACROSS THOSE NUMBERS SEEM TO BE THE MOST FAIR THAT THE MISSING PIECE REALLY WAS INCLUDING PRE SCHOOL AT THE TIME. THANK YOU. YEAH SOON MEMBER MEMBERS CITY SO I I JUST WANNA FOLLOW UP ON THAT TO THEM SO ARE YOU SAYING. THAT. LIKES A. I MEAN I. MEAN IT IS IT SEEMS TO MAKE SENSE TO ME THAT THAT THE DOLLAR'S FALL THE STUDENTS WITH THE GREATEST NEEDS. JUST LIKE THE BASIC PRINCIPLE OF LCL PATH BUT BUT YOU'RE SAYING. THAT BECAUSE IT'S HARD TO ACHIEVE LIKE SAY THE ECONOMIES OF SCALE OF OF PROVIDING TRANSPORTATION AND REAL DISTRICTS THAT THAT THAT IS. THAT THAT IS ONE REASON WHY YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO HAVE THE DOLLAR'S FALL IN THE STUDENT IT WASN'T JUST THAT ABOUT TRANSPORTATION IT WAS THAT WHEN YOU TALK TO THE ENTIRE RANGE OF THOSE SELF REPRESENTATION WHO'S WHO REPRESENT THEN ALL OF THESE. KIDS AND WE WORKED WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AT THE TIME TO TO LOOK AT THAT RANGE OF NEEDS. EVERY PART OF THE STATE HAS A DIFFERING SET OF DEMANDS AND SO WHEN YOU TRY TO GET ONE ANSWER IT'S NOT GOING TO BE AN ANSWER FOR THIS DISTRICT BUT IT IS AN ANSWER FOR HERE. BUT IT IS TRUE THAT MORE STUDENTS WITH MORE SIGNIFICANT NEEDS HAVE BECOME PART OF THE SYSTEM. AND SO I KNOW THAT ONE OF THE IDEAS THAT HAS BEEN RECENTLY TALKED ABOUT IS WHAT IF YOU ADD SOME KIND OF ADDITIVE FACTOR FOR THOSE STUDENTS WHO ARE THE MOST EXPENSIVE. BUT THEN I WOULD GO BACK TO THE MOST EXPENSIVE TO SERVE. I WOULD GO BACK TO THE CONVERSATION THAT YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO HAVE ANY KIND OF SOLUTION THAT WOULD INCENTIVIZE. A. THE. THAT. THE DETERMINATION OF ELIGIBILITY SO WAY BACK WHEN I WAS A SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGIST AND REALLY THE NUMBER THAT WAS MANIPULATED THE MOST WAS A SPECIFIC LEARNING DISABILITY OR HEATHER AND I WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT WHAT WAS YOUR UNIT RATE. THAT WOULD BE ONE WAY THAT YOU COULD MANIPULATE IT YOU JUST DON'T WANT TO BE REALLY CAREFUL ABOUT ACTUALLY HAVING TO FOLLOW SOMETHING THAT IS. AN IDENTIFIABLE BUT NOT MANIPULATE A BULL. NUMBER I ANSWER THAT TOO JUST IN THE SENSE THAT. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THE CDC IS JUST DONE WITH THE NEW CREDENTIAL IS CHANGED FROM. BEING MORE LABELED. ABOUT THAT THE STUDENT THE DISABILITY AND CHANGE THAT SORT OF THE LEVEL OF NEED AND SO ONE WAY OF RETHINKING THIS CONVERSATION ACROSS EVERY DISABILITY CATEGORY FOR THE MOST PART THERE'S A FULL RANGE OF SUPPORT NEEDS. SUMMER VERY MINIMAL AND SOME ARE VERY EXTENSIVE AND SO. ONE THOUGHT IS THAT AS WE'RE LOOKING AT SORT THIS WHOLE SIX OH TWO EQUALIZATION THAT'S THAT SOLVES. PART OF THE PROBLEM THE OTHER PROBLEM REALLY S THE HIGHER NEED STUDENTS AND THAT BECOMES A PROBLEM FOR THE FOLKS THAT HAVE. LESS ECONOMIES OF SCALE RIGHT BECAUSE ONE STUDENT WHO HAS TO GO TO A NON PUBLIC SCHOOL THINKS THE SHIP ESSENTIALLY. SO HOW DO WE ACCOUNT FOR THAT HIGH NEEDS HIGH LEVEL OF SUPPORT POPULATION ACROSS ALL THE DISABILITY CATEGORIES IT'S REALLY ABOUT. IF YOU HAVE A STUDENT WITH REALLY EXPENSIVE NEEDS HOW ARE YOU GOING TO MEET THOSE AND SO PERHAPS THERE'S A TWEENER THERE SOMEWHERE. RIGHT AND IT DOESN'T INCENTIVIZE. ANY KIND OF ENVIRONMENT OR ANYTHING ELSE. I FLESH OUT THESE LAST TWO COMMENTS DO YOU HAVE. I THINK WE'RE ALL IDENTIFYING THE NEEDLE IS BETRAYED DO HAVE PARTICULAR IDEAS ABOUT HOW TO THREAD THE NEEDLE. IN TERMS OF CRAFTING A SYSTEM THAT WILL. STRIKE THAT BALANCE THAT YOU TALKED ABOUT IN TERMS OF MAKING SURE THERE'S SOME ADDED A FACTOR TO REFLECT THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER. NEEDS AS AN EDUCATIONAL PROVISION WITH WITHOUT INCENTIVIZING. YEAH BAD BEHAVIOR FROM A FINANCIAL PERSPECTIVE. I THINK THE MOST PART THE STUDENTS THAT HAVE SIGNIFICANT SUPPORT NEEDS ARE NOT ONES THAT THAT CAN BE HIDDEN. AND THEY'RE NOT ONES THAT PETETHAT FOLKS ARE GOING TO JUST TRY TO GET MORE MONEY BECAUSE I THINK MOST FOLKS MOST PEOPLE WOULD AGREE. THAT THAT LEVEL OF STUDENT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT IS GOING TO BE INCENTIVIZED AND MANY OF THOSE STUDENTS ARE IDENTIFIED OUT OF OUR EARLY INTERVENTION. SO THEY'RE NOT THEY DON'T JUST POP IN IN LESS THERE'S SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS TO THEM LATER IN LIFE SO. SO I HEAR WHAT YOU'RE SAYING LIKE WHAT IS THE SOLUTION. I THINK I THINK IF WE CAN AGREE THAT THAT THAT'S WHERE WE ARE THAT WE HAVE LIKE A A. BASED AGREEMENT ON EQUALIZATION IN THOSE THINGS COULD BECAUSE THAT'S KIND OF WHERE WE ARE IN THE CONVERSATION WE HAVEN'T HAD THOSE OTHER CONVERSATIONS YET BUT WE ARE. WE AT WE WERE FULLY OPEN TO THAT AND WOULD LOVE TO HAVE ADDITIONAL. BRAINSTORMING SESSIONS. AND APPRECIATE THAT WE'VE HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH YOUR STAFF AS WELL JUST ABOUT YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT COULD LOOK LIKE LET'S DO THAT I MEAN A AND I ATE IN IN IT AND I GUESS. YOU KNOW ULTIMATELY MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT RIGHT IF IF. THE REAL COST DRIVER. IS FOR IS IN THE AREA THE MORE. HIGH SEVERITY. I STUDENTS. AND IF THEY'RE YOU KNOW THEY'RE THERE IS PRESUMABLY LESS. OPPORTUNITY FOR A BAD ACTOR TO MANIPULATE. THAT SORT OF DIAGNOSIS. FIVE AND SO MAYBE MAYBE THAT'S WHERE. MAYBE THAT'S GONNA KIND OF. ADDRESS THIS KEY PROBLEM. I THINK FOR EXAMPLE A MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS SO. THAT'S WHAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THE LOW INCIDENCE COMMUNITY BEING SUCH AN AD AND EASILY IDENTIFIABLE POTENTIAL GROUP BECAUSE EITHER YOUR YOUR DEATH FOR YOU OR NOT EITHER YOURS TO GREATLY HARD OF HEARING OR YOU'RE. BLIND THOSE ARE EASILY IDENTIFIABLE AND NOT PARTICULARLY DEBATABLE. SO THE LOW INCIDENCE DISABILITIES ARE CLEARLY ONE THAT COULD BE. COULD BE LOOKED AT BUT THEN IF YOU LOOK AT AUTISM WHICH USED TO BE CONSIDERED A LOW INCIDENCE DISABILITY AND IS NOW AT. EIGHT PERCENT OF THE SPECIAL ED POPULATION IN THE STATE. KNOWING THAT THAT'S A SPECTRUM DISORDER AND NOT EVERY CHILD WITH AUTISM. IS A OF THE LEVEL OF NEED THAT KRISTEN WAS JUST ADDRESSING AND SO IT WOULD BE A MATTER REALLY BEING VERY CAREFUL ABOUT WHO COULD BE INCLUDED. OUT RATIONALLY AND AND IN A FAIR WAY THAT GOES BACK TO NOT HAVE NOT THE LABEL DRIVING IT BUT RATHER THE SUPPORT ANY DRIVING AND RIGHT EXACTLY. AND HOW TO CRAFT A SYSTEM OF ACTION AND WORK ON THE STATE LEVEL IF IT WITH THE SIZE AND COMPLEXITY OF OUR SYSTEM. YEAH BUT A VERY IMPORTANT TASK FORCE TO TAKE ON I THINK BECAUSE SOME. RIGHT NOW I'M. BUT IN CVS ADEQUATE EQUITY. TERMS OF THE WAY THEY WERE FOR DISTRIBUTING THE RESOURCES SOME. OKAY BOB WELL YOU KNOW. ONCE AGAIN I KIND OF TASK YOU WITH WITH WITH GOING BACK AND TALKING YOUR FOLKS WITH WITH TRYING TO HELP US. THREAD THE NEEDLE AS BEST WE CAN. I'M. AND AND BE IN TOUCH WITH US IS WE'RE TRYING TO CROSS SOME SOLUTIONS COMING OUT OF THIS IN THE WORD WITH YEAH WELL I'VE I'VE SAID THE WORDS A. YEAH I GUESS. LET'S LET'S WORK ON IT RIGHT NOW SO MUCH. HAS BEEN SUCH AN INCREDIBLE MORNING AND I THANK YOU VERY MUCH AGAIN GREAT ALRIGHT THANK YOU GUYS THANK YOU OKAY. I'M SO THANK YOU SO MUCH NOT TO TO RUN OPEN UP PUBLIC COMMENT I'D LIKE TO GIVE THE OPTION FOR JOHN THING WENGER TO COME UP AND MAKE A COUPLE COMMENTS I KNOW THAT HE. HAD SOME ISSUES RELATED TRICYCLES WERE RAISED BEFORE AND AND AND SEES IT AND HAVE THE OPTION TO. TO SPEAK OUT ON ONE OF THE PANEL SO AND. IF YOU LIKE TO MAKE JUST A COUPLE COMMENTS ON THE THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED AND THEN. IF WE CAN. THE FOLKS WHO WANT TO MAKE THIS A PUBLIC COMMENTS THAT THEY CAN LINE UP BEHIND THE MICROPHONE THERE AND WE'LL GET WE'LL GET ON A PUBLIC COMMENT. MISTER MAKER. YEAH THANKS FOR THE TIME. JOHN WINGER ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHARTER SCHOOLS ASSOCIATION. THANK YOU FOR THE HEARING. THIS BEEN REALLY ENLIGHTENING AND CCS A DEFINITELY APPLIES THE COMMITTEE'S FOCUS ON TAKING THE APPROPRIATE STEPS TO CREATE. ONE SYSTEM THAT IS PREPARED TO SERVE FOR EACH AND EVERY STUDENT. THAT MEANS ENSURING THAT ELEAZAR OF THE FUNDS NEEDED TO SERVE. I THINK IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO REALLY TALK ABOUT SPECIAL EDUCATION IN CHARTER SCHOOLS WITHOUT IDENTIFYING THE TWO DECISIONS THAT DEFINE WHO RECEIVED THE MONEY. AND WHO HOLDS THE RESPONSIBILITY. WITHOUT THAT CONTEXT AND DISTINCTION YOU CAN'T REALLY ACCURATELY DRAW ANY CONCLUSIONS. SO FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS THAT HAVE DIRECT ACCESS AND CONTROL OVER SPECIAL EDUCATION FUNDS. WHICH IS ABOUT FIFTY PERCENT OF CHARTER SCHOOLS IN THE STATE. THE PERCENTAGE OF KIDS WITH DISABILITIES SERVED. IS VERY CLOSE TO STATE WIDE AVERAGES IN TRADITIONAL SCHOOLS. CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE DEPENDENT ON THEIR AUTHORIZING DISTRICTS FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION THERE'S NO CONTROL OVER SPECIAL EDUCATION DECISIONS OR ENROLLMENT TRENDS. IN MANY CASES CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE PROHIBITED FROM SERVING STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES. WE BELIEVE THIS IS A. CRITICAL DISTINCTION THAT NEEDS TO BE RECOGNIZED. WHEN EVALUATING THIS ISSUE. OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS DUE TO AN INCREASE IN OF AVAILABLE OPTIONS FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION A TANAMI THROUGH CHARTER SELF THOSE AND OTHER INNOVATIVE. ARRANGEMENTS. CHARTER SCHOOLS HAVE SEEN A SIGNIFICANT GROWTH IN THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS ACROSS THE FULL CONTINUING. CONTINUUM OF NEED. ALL ELEAZAR MUST HAVE THE FUNDS AVAILABLE TO ENSURE THAT EACH AND EVERY CHILD IS ON A PATH TO SUCCESSFULLY TRANSITION. INTO A COLLEGE OR CAREER. THE SYSTEM NEEDS ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO ENSURE EQUITY HOWEVER THE SYSTEM ALSO NEEDS INCREASED LEVELS OF ACCOUNTABILITY TO ENSURE WE REACH OUR DESIRED OUTCOMES. AND AS WE MOVE FORWARD CCA CCS A LOOKS FORWARD TO CONTINUING CONVERSATIONS WITH. THE LEGISLATURE ON HOW WE FIND THE APPROPRIATE FUNDING TO ENSURE EQUITY IN THE SYSTEM FOR ALL STUDENTS. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH YES SIR. YES STEVE WARD A LEGISLATIVE ANALYST FOR CLOSE UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT AND THE SCHOOL FUNDING COALITION. UP PLEASE NOTE OUR EMPLOYEES AND OUR PARENTS ARE TRULY EXCITED THAT OUR LEGISLATIVE LEADERS. ARE TAKING ON A HUGE CHALLENGE STATE ADEQUATELY AND EQUITABLY. FUND THE REAL COST OF PROVIDING SERVICES FOR OUR CHILDREN ADULTS. WITH SPECIAL NEEDS ON THEIR BEHALF WE JUST REALLY TRULY TRULY THANK YOU. THANK YOU. WITHOUT. MY NAME IS JIM ANDERSON I'M THE SUBDIRECTORY LOS ANGELES COUNTY COURT SCHOOL SPECIAL EDUCATION LOCAL PLAN AREA. OF LOS ANGELES COUNTY CHARTER SPECIAL EDUCATION LOCAL PLAN AREA. WITHIN THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION. AND THE CURRENT CHAIR OF THE SELF ADMINISTRATORS ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA. REPRESENTING ALL STUDENTS TO DISABILITIES IN OUR FAMILIES IN CALIFORNIA GOT A LOT ON YOUR PLATE. YES. THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY PROVIDE INPUT TODAY. ADDITIONALLY THE ASSOCIATIONAL BE HAPPILY WILL HAPPILY SEND YOU A RECENT WHITE PAPER ON THE IMPORTANT ROLE THE WORK OF SELF IS ACROSS THE STATE. IT IS CLEAR THERE IS A COLLABORATIVE A LINE ACROSS THE STATE AMONG AGENCIES AND IS HIGHLIGHTED BY DATA PROVIDED IN REPORTS TO SPECIAL EDUCATION. FINANCE INCLUDING THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE THE STATEWIDE SPECIAL EDUCATION TASK FORCE IN THE PUBLIC POLICY THROUGH TO CALIFORNIA. THE ALIGNMENT RECOMMENDS THE CRITICAL NEED TO SUPPORTER LEE INTERVENTION. INCREASE THE AVAILABILITY OF WELL TRAINED A PREPARED SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHERS. AND ADDRESS THE LONGSTANDING INADEQUACY OF SPECIAL EDUCATION FUNDING. PLEASE JOIN THE SIGNIFICANT COLLABORATIVE ALIGNMENT AN ACT TO PROPERLY FUND THE EDUCATION OF STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES. DEMONSTRATING THE COLLECTIVE CONCERNING CARE OTHER EDUCATIONAL NEEDS TOWARD IMPROVED. ACADEMIC AND POST SECONDARY OUTCOMES. THANK YOU THANK YOU AND HAVE. WOULD LOVE TO SEE THE REPORT AND I'M I'M WE SHOULD ALSO PROBABLY WITHIN A MORE LIKE TO. YES I I ME LAME LYNN I LIVE HERE IN THE LOCAL SACRAMENTO AREA AND I REPRESENT FAMILY VOICES OF CALIFORNIA WHICH IS AN ORGANIZATION REPRESENTS THOUSANDS OF FAMILIES OF CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES. THEY I WOULD LIKE TO PROVIDE YOU A PARENT PERSPECTIVE I'M I HAVE TWO CHILDREN WITH SPECIAL NEEDS AND MY FIFTEEN YEAR OLDS IS HAS DOWN SYNDROME AND INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY AND SPEECH AND LANGUAGE IMPAIRMENTS. HE ALSO PLAYS THE PIANO HE RIDES HIS BIKE AND HE KNOWS MORE ABOUT THE US PRESIDENT'STHAN MOST OF US I'M SURE DO. MY HUSBAND ALSO A TEACHER SO I SEE THAT GLIMPSE OF THINGS AS WELL. TOBY HAD REALLY GREAT INTENSIVE EARLY INTERVENTION SERVICES BUT WE HAD TO PUT HIM IN PRIVATE PRESCHOOL SO THAT HE COULD BE FULLY INCLUDED. I'M. HE THEN WENT TO PUBLIC SCHOOL AND AND LATER LIKE MANY I PULL TOBY OUT OF OUR DISTRICT TO ATTEND A CHARTER SCHOOL IN ANOTHER DISTRICT SO THAT HE COULD HAVE. A MORE INDIVIDUALIZED OPPORTUNITY TO ACHIEVE. I KNOW FINDING IS A HUGE ISSUE OBVIOUSLY BUT I WONDER IF WESHOULD BE TALKING ABOUT. SOME SORT OF INTEGRATED EDUCATION FINANCING TRAINING AND SERVICE DELIVERY. AND STOP SEGREGATING STUDENTS IN SPECIAL EDUCATION WHILE KEEPING THOSE PROTECTIONS THAT WE SO DESPERATELY NEED. I HAVE FOUND A PRESUMPTION OF INCOMPETENCE. I'M IN A LACK OF INDIVIDUALLY INDIVIDUALITY AND MY SONS IEP. LIKE ANY PARENT I WANT MY CHILD TO GRADUATE FROM HIGH SCHOOL BUT JUST TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA I'M CONSTANTLY QUESTIONED AND CHALLENGED. ABOUT THIS WHEN I TOURED MY LOCAL HIGH SCHOOL I DID NOT SEE ONE CHILD WHO LOOK LIKE MINE AND THAT WAS VERY TELLING THAT TOLD ME A LOT ABOUT THE EXPECTATION. OF STUDENTS LIKE MINE. THERE'S NO EXPECTATION OR MECHANISM TO INCLUDE THESE STUDENTS OFTEN BECAUSE THE FUNDING. IT'S EXHAUSTING TO CONSTANTLY FIGHT. OR WHAT SENATOR WILL CALLED CIVIL RIGHTS. I REGULARLY HERE CAN'T WON'T AND DON'T SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T DONE IT BEFORE. TOBY DREAMS OF GOING TO COLLEGE LIKE HIS BROTHER AS HE AS HE SHOULD. AND I FIND IT THE VERY SYSTEM THAT SHOULD BE PREPARING HIM IS IS FURTHER DISABLING HIM. MAYBE IF WE CHANGE OUR MINDSET AND OUR EXPECTATIONS WE COULD REDUCE THE LONG TERM NEED FOR INTENSIVE SERVICES FOR MANY. AND IDENTIFY EFFICIENCIES THAT COULD BE REALIZED. THROUGH TRUE INTEGRATION. WE SHOULD BE INCENTIVIZING GROWTH AND ACHIEVEMENT WHEN WE LOOK AT THOSE GOALS IN THOSE IP'S THAT MIGHT BE A WAY BEGIN LOOKING AT THINGS. THE FINDING AS IT STANDS I THINK REFLECTS THE WAY THAT WE AS A SOCIETY STILL THINK OF THESE CHILDREN. WHO ARE SO OFTEN IN A SEPARATE CLASSROOM AT THE BACK OF THE CAMPUS THANK YOU? YOU THINK YOU'RE MUCH. YES MA'AM. IT AFTERNOON I'M CINDY CHANDLER. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE MY EXPERIENCE AS A PARENT AND A REPRESENTATIVE OF FAMILY EMPOWERMENT CENTERS. I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF FAMILY SUPER FAMILY EMPOWERMENT CENTER AND FAMILY RESOURCE CENTER. RESEARCH SUTTER YUBA AND COLUSA COUNTIES. AND FAMILY SOUP WAS ONE OF THE LAST CENTERS FUNDED AND THAT WAS BACK IN TWO THOUSAND SIX. CLOSE TO THIRTY YEARS AGO WHEN OUR DAUGHTER EMILY LOST THROUGH LANGUAGE DIDN'T MAKE EYE CONTACT ONLY EIGHT THREE THINGS HAD MELTDOWNS AND SENSORY ISSUES. WE WERE AT A TOTAL LOSS AND AT THAT TIME MY HUSBAND CHRIS CHANDLER WAS AN ASSEMBLY MEMBER FOR DISTRICT THREE. THERE WAS NO RESOURCE FOR PARENTS. PREPARED TO PARENT SUPPORT. NO ONE TO HELP US NAVIGATE THE SERVICE SYSTEM OR EXPLAIN WHAT TO DO NEXT. IT WAS ISOLATING AND TERRIFYING AND WE WERE LOSING TIME. THAT WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY THE WINDOW FOR LANGUAGE WAS CLOSING. SO WE KNEW THERE HAD TO BE A BETTER WAY. AS PARENTS WE KNEW WE NEEDED TO HELP WE NEEDED HELP TO GAIN ACCESS TO THE SPECIAL ED SYSTEM. WE NEEDED TO KNOW HOW THE INDIVIDUALIZED EDUCATION PLAN PROCESS WORKED. AND WE KNEW WE WANTED TO BE ACTIVE PARTICIPANTS BUT HOW. PARENTS ENTER A UNIVERSE OF UP WITH THE LANGUAGE THEY DIDN'T CHOOSE. PRIOR WRITTEN NOTICE FUNCTIONAL ANALYSIS RTI MTS AS YOU DL INCLUSION LEAST RESTRICTIVE ENVIRONMENT LIST GOES ON. THEY FEEL THEY ARE LOSING PRECIOUS TIME EACH TIME A DOOR CLOSES. A FOR SERVICES AND MATCH THE FULL ARRAY OF RESOURCES IS NOT SHARED. THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT QUESTIONS TO ASK BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY DON'T KNOW. THEY SUSPECT THEIR CHILD HAS A DISABILITY THEY KNOW SOMETHING IS NOT RIGHT AND IT FEELS LIKE NO ONE WANTS TO ASSESS THEIR CHILD. AND PROVIDE THE HELP THEIR CHILD NEEDS. WHAT WE WANT THEM TO KNOW THAT THERE IS A BETTER WAY WE WANT ALL THE PARENTS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO HAVE THAT EQUAL ACCESS TO THE SUPPORT? FAMILY EMPOWERMENT CENTERS PROVIDE THE INFORMATION AND PARENT TO PARENT SUPPORT TO THE PARENTS CAN BE THE BEST ADVOCATES. FOR THEIR CHILD WITH A DISABILITY. WE SUPPORT ALL DISABILITY. FEC SERVICE STUDENTS AGED THREE TO TWENTY TWO. WE COLLABORATE WITH SCHOOL DISTRICTS IEP TEAMS TEACHERS AND SELF AS. THOSE ARE OUR PARTNERS. SCHOOLS MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL SOCIAL WORKERS THEY ALL REFER THEIR FAMILIES THE FCC'S OUR SERVICES ARE RESPECTED AND VALUED BY OUR PARTNERS. WE WORK HARD TO HELP RESOLVE CONFLICT BEFORE IT ESCALATES AND WE WE DON'T WANT PARENTS TO HAVE TO GO THROUGH THOSE THOSE FRUSTRATING MEETINGS AND FRUSTRATING. YEARS OF LACK OF SERVICES. IF A PARENT HAS A CONCERN ABOUT THE DEVELOPMENT OF THEIR CHILD. FAMILY EMPOWERMENT CENTERS ARE THE PERFECT PLACE TO START THE JOURNEY TOGETHER. ONE OF OUR PARENTS SAID IT BEST THE FAMILY EMPOWERMENT CENTER GAVE US HOPE SHE SAID. WE HAD LOST OUR HOPE BEFORE WE MET FAMILY SOUP. AND I HAVE HOPE AND CONVICTION THAT THE PROMISE OF SP FIVE ELEVEN DEFINE THE THIRTY TWO REGIONAL FEC STATEWIDE IS FULFILLED. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU YES SIR. I MY NAME SCRAP PRICE AND THE CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER FOR THE LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT I'VE BEEN WITH THE DISTRICT ABOUT EIGHT MONTHS BEFORE THAT I WAS WITH THE LA COUNTY FOR FOUR YEARS AS THE CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER. WE'RE ALL HERE WE UNDERSTAND THAT. AS SPECIAL ED IS UNDER FUNDED AND WE'RE GLAD THAT YOU RECOGNIZE THAT ALSO AND WE'RE GRATEFUL TO BE HERE TODAY. OTHERS TO WORDS THAT HAVE BEEN BATTED AROUND EQUAL AND. EQUITY YET WHAT'S EQUITABLE AND WHAT'S EQUAL. AND. THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO US THAT LOS ANGELES UNIFIED. WE FEEL THAT AN EQUITABLE SYSTEM IS ONE WHERE THE FUNDS FOLLOWED THE KIDS THAT ACTUALLY HAVE THE NEEDS. AND THAT THE AMOUNT OF FUNDS THAT FOLLOW THOSE KIDS. IT DEPENDS ON THE SEVERITY. OF THEIR NEEDS. VLC FF IS A GREAT MODEL IT'S AN EQUITY BASED SYSTEM YOU HAVE A BASE AND THEN YOU HAVE A SUPPLEMENTAL GRANT. AND THEN WHEN THERE'S A CERTAIN CONCENTRATION OF THOSE PARTICULAR STUDENTS YOU GET AN ADDITIONAL FUNDING STREAM. I WE'RE NOT SUGGESTING THAT. WE NEED TO BE PART SPECIAL ED NEEDS TO BE PART OF THAT L. CFL FORMULA IT WOULD SPECIALLY IT WOULD BE A BAD THING FOR US TO BE PART OF THE END DUPLICATED. COUNT. BUT THAT SAME TYPE OF EQUITY SYSTEM NEEDS TO APPLY TO SPECIAL ED. WHERE IT THE MONEY FOLLOWS THE STUDENTS AND THE AMOUNT OF MONEY FOLLOWS THE KNEES? SO WHAT'S YOUR ARGUMENT TO THE POINT THAT WENT BEHIND A V. SIX R. TWO THAT SAID THAT YOU KNOW. THE OLD SYSTEM WHERE THE MONEY REALLY FALL THE STUDENTS CREATED ALL SORTS OF PERVERSE INCENTIVES. SO AT THE DETAIL THAT WAS IN THAT SYSTEM I THINK THAT JUST LIKE AL CFF THERE ARE CERTAIN CATEGORIES YOU HAVE MODERATE TO SEVERE THAT COULD. HAVE A CERTAIN GRANT MONEY WE HAD OF VARIOUS FORMULAS THAT WE PUT TOGETHER. THAT WE'VE SHARED WITH DIFFERENT COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND SPECIAL EDUCATION DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THAT WOULD LOVE TO SHARE WITH YOU. IN IN DETAIL AT ANOTHER TIME BUT IN REGARDS TO INCENTIVIZE SCENE. EDUCATORS WHO. OR SEVERELY RESTRICT OR OR. CATEGORIZE STUDENTS IN THAT MORE SEVERE CATEGORY IN ORDER TO GET FUNDING. I THINK THAT THE. GROUP THAT WAS AROUND THE TABLE EARLIER. REALLY ADDRESS THAT I HAVEN'T SEEN THAT WITHIN DISTRICTS WE WANT TO GET THE LEAST RESTRICTIVE ENVIRONMENT. AND AND MOVE FORWARD WITH THAT. AND WE FEEL THAT THE EQUITY ISSUE IS IS SUCH THAT IT'S IMPORTANT ENOUGH TO. TO DIRECT THOSE FUNDS TO THOSE STUDENTS THAT SAID ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE SUPPORTED. LAST YEAR. ASSEMBLY MEMBER MARS SU CHI'S FOURTEEN FORTY NINE. HE WAS TRYING TO DO THAT SAME TYPE OF A MODEL. WHERE THERE WAS? AN ADDITIONAL AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT WOULD FOLLOW SPECIFIC STUDENTS WITH THEM. THANK YOU SIR THANK YOU SO MUCH AND. YES MA'AM OR WASCO WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF SUBURBAN SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY EDUCATION ORGANIZATION. WE ARE A DIVERSE GROUP OF. DISTRICTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE WERE IN SUPPORT OF OF NUMBER OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE AND SPECIAL ED TASK FORCE THE EQUALIZATION FUNDING. AS WELL AS PRE SCHOOL. I'M GETTING PRESCHOOL FUNDING AND IN ADDITION WE'D LIKE TO BE BACK ON TOP OF. SENATOR PANTS COMMENTS FORGET GUARDING MEDICO AND ADDITIONAL ACCESS TO MALL LDAP ATI PSP T. FUNDING. WHICH IS CRITICAL TO HELP SERVE THE MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS OF STUDENTS COMING INTO OUR SCHOOLS SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU AND THE COMMITTEE TO ADDRESS THOSE NEEDS. THANK YOU. MR. THAT AFTERNOON MY NAME IS DAVID TOSSING I SERVED AS THE ASSOCIATE SUPERINTENDENT FOR THE ELDORADO COUNTY SELF AS WELL AS THE ELDORADO. CHARTER SAGA ALSO SERVE AS THE CHAIR TO THE COALITION. I'M FOR ADEQUATE FUNDING AND SPECIALIZED WHICH REPRESENTS OVER NINETY FIVE PERCENT OF THE SELF IS IN THE MAJORITY OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS I'M THROUGHOUT THE STATE I WOULD SECOND THE COMMENTS THAT MY COLLEAGUE. JIM ANDERSON A SHARED IN TERMS OF OUR SUPPORT OF THE CONVERSATION. I BELIEVE THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSCORE IT EVEN IN THE CURRENT FUNDING MODEL NUMBER FUNDING BASED ON EIGHTY EIGHT. THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS IN SPECIAL ED HAS GROWN BACK THE QUAIDS TWO ADDITIONAL SERVICES FOR STUDENTS SO I BELIEVE THAT REPRESENTS THAT EDUCATORS AND FAMILIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. ARE COMMITTED TO MEETING THE NEEDS OF STUDENTS EVEN WHEN THERE ISN'T AN INCENTIVE. AND QUITE FRANKLY AN ADEQUATE FUNDING AND SO WE SUPPORT THE CONVERSATION THAT ALLOWS US TO CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD. AND IN ANSWER TO ONE OF THE QUESTIONS HOW DO WE THREAD THAT NEEDLE. I WOULD HIGHLIGHT THE INCREASE FUNDING FOR PRESCHOOL I'M EQUALIZING FUNDING FOR SELF AS I'M AS WELL AS HAVING THE THE LOW INCIDENCE RATE AND I WOULD ADD. THE CONVERSATIONS ARE TAKING PLACE AROUND INCREASE TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY. I WOULD NOT GET RID MY CAR IF I DIDN'T PUT ENOUGH FUEL OIL AND ARMS SO I WOULD. WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT HAD APPROPRIATE RESOURCES AND THEN MAKE AN EVALUATION ABOUT WHAT COMPONENTS OF THE SYSTEM NEED TO BE REVISED OR MAINTAIN. THANK YOU. AWESOME MIKE DID YOU CAN. TRADE IT FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLES. YEAH. OKAY YES MA'AM. GOOD EVENING THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY SPEAK ON BEHALF OF MY STUDENTS MY NAME IS VAL WILLIAMS ON THE SUPERINTENDENT FOR THE ALBANY SCHOOL DISTRICT. VERY SMALL DISTRICT JUST NORTH OF BERKELEY ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED STUDENTS WELCOME HERE. I WANNA TAKE LOADS OF A DIFFERENT. STANCE TO GIVE A SNAPSHOT OF WHAT THE INADEQUACY OF FUNDING FOR SPECIAL ED ACTUALLY LOOKS LIKE A SMALL DISTRICT LIKE MINE. OUR NUMBER ONE OBJECTIVE IN OUR STRATEGIC PLAN IS TO ENSURE THAT ALL STUDENTS REACH THEIR FULL POTENTIAL AND SO TO DO SO WE NEED MORE FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR SPECIAL ED. LAST YEAR FOR MILLIONS FORTUNE REFORMING AND DOLLARS OF OUR GENERAL FUND MONIES WERE SPENT TOWARDS SPECIAL EDUCATION. THIS REPRESENTS SIXTY PERCENT OF THE TOTAL SPECIAL EDUCATION EXPENSES THAT ARE NOT FUNDED BY THE STATE. SIX SHORT YEARS AGO WE SERVE THE SAME NUMBER STUDENTS AT ONLY ONE THIRD OF THE COST OF SPECIAL EDUCATION. EACH YEAR THIS SIXTY PERCENT MEANS THAT MY DISTRICT DOES NOT HAVE TO MILLION DOLLARS TO HIRE MUCH NEEDED COUNSELORS READING SPECIALISTS MASS SPECIALISTS NURSES SOCIAL WORKERS AND QUALITY PARA PROFESSIONALS. WHO ARE NEXT TO TEACHERS EVERY SINGLE DAY MEETING WITH MY STUDENTS? EACH YEAR THIS MEANS THAT MY DISTRICT DOES NOT HAVE TO MILLION DOLLARS TO PROVIDE HIGHER WAGES FOR MY STAFF TO LIVE CLOSER TO MY COMMUNITY. TO MAKE INVESTMENTS IN CLOSING THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP TO MAKING INVESTMENTS IN GETTING MORE KIDS TO GRADUATE TO INVESTING IN PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT FOR MY GENERAL ED SPECIALLY TEACHERS AND MY POWER PROFESSIONALS. EACH YEAR THIS MEANS THAT WE DO NOT HAVE TO MILLION DOLLARS THEIR PROVE THE SAFETY SECURITY OF MY SCHOOLS. WE NEED MORE THE STATE SUPPORT TO ENSURE THAT ALL STUDENTS REACH OUR POTENTIAL AND SO I'M ASKING THAT YOU HELP US COLLECTIVELY ADDRESSES THIS ISSUE. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME REGINA YOU NICER THAN THE SCHOOL BOARD FOR. AS ELECTED TO THIS BODY IN AND. NO NO THOSE PROBLEMS INTIMATELY. SO THANK YOU. FOR HAVING THIS HEARING HERE TODAY YES MA'AM. THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY IT'S BEEN A GREAT MORNING. LISTENING TO EVERYBODY I'M KATIE BABCOCK DIRECTOR OF NORTH REGION SALPA SPECIAL EDUCATION LOCAL PLAN RESENT. BUT THAT'S ALBANY AREA OKAY OKAY YEAH THAT'S COMING NORTH REGION EIGHTY A IS ABOUT TWENTY SIX THOUSAND AND WE HAVE FIVE DISTRICTS THAT ACTUALLY PACK A PUNCH ALBANY'S ONE OF THEM. BERKELEY PIEDMONT EMORY AND ALAMEDA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT SO WE'RE A SMALL SELF A BUTTON. THERE'S A LOT GOING ON. OUR FEDERAL GRANTS FOR PRESCHOOL EQUALS ABOUT TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS PER CHILD. WITH DISABILITIES AGE THREE AND FOUR AND WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT IS OFTEN A NEED FOR A LOW STUDENT TEACHER RATIO AND OFTEN ADDITIONAL SPECIALISTS THERE'S A HUGE. SHORTFALL OUR FIVE DISTRICTS NO DEEPLY. THAT EARLY INTERVENTION IS CRITICAL SO WE ALLOCATE BY POLICY EIGHT POINT FIVE SEVEN PERCENT OF OUR STATE APPORTIONMENT. FOR SPECIALIZED SERVICES FOR PRE SCHOOL STUDENTS FUNDS THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE USED FOR STUDENTS OF ALL AGES AND THERE'S STILL A SHORTFALL WITH THOSE ADDITIONAL FUNDS SO I'M ADVOCATING THAT CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO BUILD A MECHANISM IN THE AB SIX SO TO. FOR PRESCHOOL SPECIAL EDUCATION SERVICES THANK YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. HELLO NAMES INTERNET PELLETS HERE IN THE SENIOR ADMINISTRATOR FOR SAM MATTEO COUNTY SELFLESS SPECIAL EDUCATION LOCAL PLAN WE SERVE OVER TEN THOUSAND STUDENTS WITH INDIVIDUAL EDUCATION PROGRAMS. I HAVE THIRTY ELEAZAR AND BY FIVE OF WHICH ARE CHARTER SCHOOLS THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR CONVENING THIS HEARING AND IT'S GREAT TO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE INPUT. I'D INTENDED TO SPEAK ON THE CRITICAL IMPORTANCE OF EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION AND FUNDING. BUT INSTEAD I'M GOING TO SPEAK TO SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT I RAISED ABOUT RACE ABOUT LOCAL CONTROL AND ELSIE FF. SELF IS REALLY REPRESENT THE ORIGINAL LOCAL CONTROL LOCAL PLANS OF EVERY SILVA DETERMINE HOW AB SIX OH TWO DLLARS CAN BEST MEET THE NEEDS OF THE REGION IN WHICH IS BEING SERVED AS KATIE TO SHARE. SPECIAL EDUCATION AS A FEDERAL ENTITLEMENT AND KEEPING THOSE FUNDS IN A SEPARATE ALLOCATION ENSURES THAT LIMITED FUNDS PROVIDED FOR THOSE NEEDY STUDENTS ARE SPENT DIRECTLY ON THOSE POPULATIONS. ATTEMPTING TO RESOLVE A CHRONIC UNDERFUNDING BY AN EMPTINESS INSUFFICIENT PART OF DOLLARS INTO ANOTHER INSUFFICIENT PART OF DOLLARS WITHOUT FIRST ATTEMPTING TO ADDRESS THE INADEQUACY. ONLY WILL EXACERBATE THE CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE. NEITHER LCF NOR AB SIX OH TO CURRENTLY ADDRESS EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION AND PRESCHOOL FUNDING. NEITHER ENSURES ADEQUATE OR EQUITABLE FUNDING FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION AMBLE FOR DEPENDED ON CALCULATIONS THAT MAY NOT REFLECT THE UNIQUE NEEDS OF THE SPECIAL ED POPULATIONS SUCH AS INCREASING NUMBERS SERVED. AND I'M THE BEARING LEVELS OF SUPPORT OR NEED THAT THOSE STUDENTS A HALF. RIGHT NOW WE BELIEVE THAT ADDITIONAL FUNNY IS DESPERATELY NEEDED ESPECIALLY FOR EARLY CHILDHOOD AND FREE K.. WE NEED TO ADDRESS THE NEED FOR EQUALIZATION ACROSS THE STATE AND RESOLVING THESE ISSUES FIRST COULD PROVIDE A FIRM FOUNDATION FOR FUTURE SPECIAL ED FISCAL PROBLEM SOLVING AND PLANNING. THE SUBASSOCIATION AND COALITION FOR ADEQUATE FUNDING HAVE DEVELOPED SEVERAL DRAFT PROPOSALS THAT WE HAVE BEEN KICKING AROUND OURSELVES WE WOULD LOOK VERY MUCH FORWARD TO THE OPPORTUNITY. TO SHARE THAT INFORMATION WITH MEMBERS OF THE OF THE OF THE PANEL OR HE'S. AND WE HAVE ARE REALLY WILLING TO COME TO THE TABLE AND SPEAK JUST RECENTLY I HAVE WRITTEN A PROPOSAL FOR OUT OF HOME. CARE FUNDING AM ADJUSTMENT SO THERE ARE DEFINITELY RESOURCES WITHIN THE COMMUNITY THAT COULD FORWARD THAT THAT NEED TO THREAD THE NEEDLE THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU CAN IN THE ORGANIZATIONAL RETURNED.

YEAH WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE BIG. IS SO MY S. SUPERINTENDENTS COUNSEL ASKED ME TO BRING THIS MESSAGE TO THE COMMITTEE TODAY AND I THINK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. VERY PROUD OF THE PROGRAMS AND SERVICES WE PROVIDE OUR STUDENTS PARENTS AND STAFF EVEN THEN HERONS INEQUITY OF THE STATES AB SIX OH TWO FUNDING MODEL OURSELF AS AB SIX SO TO BASE RATE IS SET AT FIVE HUNDRED. AND. EIGHTEEN DOLLARS FOR THAT'S THE AT THE. THE STATEWIDE TARGET RATE IS FIVE HUNDRED AND FORTY DOLLARS AND NINETY NINE CENTS SO THE DISPARITY RESULTS IN A YEARLY DEFICIT OF ONE POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS OF FUNDING FOR STUDENTS. AND WE BELIEVE THAT THE AV SIX SO TO RATE SHOULD BE. EQUALIZED THROUGHOUT THE STATE AM. THAT IS A LOT OF MONEY WE ARE A BIG DISTRICT AND. SPREAD OUT BETWEEN THE FOURTEEN DISTRICTS IT WOULD MAKE AN IMPACT AND OF COURSE OUR EARLY. EDUCATION. WE HAVE MANY MANY PROGRAMS FOR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES AND. AND OUR PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS BUT THEY'RE ALL RUNNING AT AT WITH NO FUNDING BASICALLY AND THE DISTRICTS ARE SUPPORTING THAT FINDING AND THEY'RE ALL ADVOCATES FOR THE EARLY EDUCATION PIECE SO.

YES MA'AM. HIGH. EVELYN ADVERTISING WITH DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA THOUGHT FIRST I'D LIKE TO. THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR A VERY. FRUITFUL CONVERSATION AROUND VERY COMPLEX ISSUES. MORE. IMPORTANTLY FROM DRC'S PERSPECTIVE AS WE LOOK AT FUNDING GENERALLY IN THE CONTEXT SPECIAL EDUCATION. WE THINK REALLY IT'S IMPORTANT TO LOOK AT. IDENTIFYING OUTCOMES FOR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES SO THAT FUNDING ADJUSTMENTS COULD REALLY BE TIED TO SEEING SOME PROGRESS FOR STUDENTS WHETHER IT'S IN EMPLOYMENT I THINK WAS THE LAST COMMITTEE. MEETING ABOUT THAT ISSUE UP OR POST SECONDARY EDUCATION OR ANY NUMBER OF OUTCOME BUT REALLY LOOKING AT IS THIS MONEY LEADING TO. HOPEFUL OUTCOMES FOR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES IN THE CONTEXT OF EMPLOYMENT INTEGRATION. NOTE WAS SECONDARY EDUCATION AT SUCH A AND THEN TRYING TO GET SOME DATA TO SEE IF THAT'S ACTUALLY HAPPENING. VERSUS A VERY MUCH A PROPONENT OF THAT CONCEPT TO REALLY SEE THAT OUR MONEY IS GOING TO ACTUALLY IMPROVING OUTCOMES FOR STUDENTS. YEAH YEAH MAKE SENSE. THANK YOU. I. THINK IT IS A CARING ABOUT. SEIU CALIFORNIA I THINK WE TOTALLY AGREE WITH THOSE COMMENTS OF BELIEVE THAT OUR CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES DESERVED UP ALL OF THEIR NEEDS MET AND FULLY FUNDED AND WE THINK THE MONEY. TO FOLLOW THE STUDENTS AND WOULD LIKE TO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR. BRINGING UP THE ROAD THE CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEES. PLAY IN MAKING SURE THAT THEY'RE NOT OVERLOOK THINGS ONE VERY IMPORTANT PIECE OF THE PUZZLE. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON GETTING AWAY WITH THE CALIFORNIA LINES OF CHILD AND FAMILY SERVICES OUR MEMBERS ARE NONPROFIT PROVIDERS OF FOSTER CARE IN CHILDREN'S MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. WEEP UP TALK ABOUT THE WHOLE SPECTRUM FROM FOSTER YOUTH OR IN GENERAL EDUCATION ALL THE WAY UP TO FOSTER YOUTH AND STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES WERE BEING SERVED AT OUR MOST RESTRICTIVE SETTINGS. OUR MEMBERS HAVE BEEN ENGAGING IN CONVERSATIONS WITH THE DEPARTMENT EDUCATION AS WELL AS FINANCE ALREADY STARTING TO TALK ABOUT AND THINK THROUGH THOSE VERY HIGH NEED STUDENTS INCLUDING THOSE. WITH VERY HIGH MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS AND SOME CASES ARE I'M HADN'T REQUIRING RESIDENTIAL CARE AND A NON PUBLIC SCHOOLS. WE ALSO ARE REALLY ENGAGING AND THINK THROUGH THE OUT OF HOME CARE FORMULA THAT HAS BEEN BRIEFLY MENTIONED. I'M SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING THESE GUYS GOT DISCUSSIONS WITH THE MOVING FORWARD. MAKE YOU THINK YOU'RE MUCH. YES. IT AFTERNOON I'M SUSAN BOBBITT BOTH I'M FROM THE WEST AND SOUTH BY. DECEMBER TODAY NO SAMBAR STUDENTS AND ABOUT THIRTY THREE DISTRICTS. A MY SUPERINTENDENT TEXAS ALSO SERIOUSLY THAT HE BROUGHT A DELEGATION UP EARLIER THIS WEEK AND WE MET WITH SEVEN. OF FIFTEEN DIFFERENT MEMBERS THAT WAS AN AWESOME OPPORTUNITY SO I THINK YOU KNOW EIGHT. FOR TAKING THE TIME TO LISTEN TO ARE VERY SERIOUS NEEDS I'M WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT AB SIX OR TWO IS TWENTY YEARS OLD NOW. AND SO IT'S ABOUT TIME THAT WE DO RETHINK THIS. I'M. IN MY CELL BUT. WE DID HAVE A HUNDRED AND SEVENTEEN THOUSAND STUDENTS WHEN I ARRIVED FIVE YEARS AGO WE LOST A DISTRICT OF TWENTY TWO THOUSAND LOST YOUR SO WE'RE NOW DOWN TO EIGHTY NINE THOUSAND STUDENTS. ON THE NATURAL WE WERE STILL DOWN TWO HUNDRED ELEVEN THOUSAND SO WE HAD LOST SIX THOUSAND STUDENTS IN A FIVE YEAR PERIOD. I'M WE'RE FUNDED IT FIVE TOTAL SOON PART WAS NOT SPECIAL NEEDS STUDENT. HOWEVER OUR STAR POPULATION OF STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES HAD PROBABLY GONE UP ABOUT TWO THOUSAND IN THAT SAME AMOUNT OF TIME. WE ARE FUNDED AT FIVE HUNDRED AND TWENTY THREE DOLLARS AND FORTY TWO CENTS PER ADA. IF THE STATE WERE TO COLLIDE SPENDING TO SIX HUNDRED AND TWENTY TWO DOLLARS THAT WOULD MAKE OVER TWELVE MILLION DOLLAR DIFFERENCE FOR US. EVERY TIME THAT YOU LOOK HOT BUT ENCROACHMENT OR GENERAL FUND CONTRIBUTION IS DOING TO JANETTE. WE SO MUCH WHEN THEY HAVE INCLUSIVE SETTINGS FOR STUDENTS. BUT AS YOU LOOK A GENERAL FUND HAVING TO MAKE UP THE DIFFERENCE AND WERE RIGHT ALONG WITH THE STATE FIGURE SIXTY TWO PERCENT. THEN IT TAKES AWAY ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY FOR STUDENTS TO BE AN JENNETTE OR TAKES WAY BAND OR TAKES AWAY ARTER ALL THOSE OTHER THINGS THAT OUR KIDS CAN DO SO WELL AT. I'M IN THE LAST TEN YEARS WE'VE HAD AN INCREASE IN AUTISM IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN WE HAD SIX HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE STUDENTS WITH AUTISM. IN THE NINE DISTRICTS I HAVE NOW THAT'S NOT EVEN INCLUDING THE TENTH DISTRICT THAT HAD. TWENTY TWO THOUSAND STUDENTS TOTAL LAST YEAR WE WERE UP TO SIXTEEN HUNDRED IT'S A HUGE INCREASE OF OVER AT THAT ALMOST A THOUSAND STUDENTS WITH AUTISM. AND AS WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER TODAY. YOU KNOW THERE'S A WHOLE SPECTRUM SOME OF THEM CAN BE VERY VERY INTELLIGENT AND DO VERY WELL THE JANET MAINSTREAM WITH YOU SERVICES. BUT SEVENTY PERCENT IS THAT NUMBER THAT I'VE HEARD THAT ALSO HAVE AN INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY. I'M I'M PROUD TO SAY THOUGH WE HAVE ALSO RETURNED STUDENTS GENERAL EDUCATION. IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN WE RETURNED SEVEN HUNDRED AND THIRTY SIX STUDENTS TO GENERAL EDUCATION. TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY SEVEN. WE HAVE A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY EIGHT STUDENTS IN NON PUBLIC SCHOOLS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THAT A LITTLE BIT TODAY. AND WE SPENT TWELVE MILLION LAST YEAR AND IT WAS APPROXIMATELY SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR PER STUDENT AND THAT DOESN'T EVEN COST. INCLUDE THE MENTAL HEALTH COSTS BECAUSE THOSE ARE ON TOP OF THAT. I'M JUST TALKING ABOUT STATE AND FEDERAL FUNDING. ARE ENCROACHMENT LAST YEAR I HAVE A CHART AND LEANED OVER HAD A COPY OF IT I THINK FROM OUR MEETING EARLIER THIS WEEK WHICH I CAN LEAVE WITH YOU. THAT SHOWS OUR ENCROACHMENT DISTRICT BY DISTRICT. SOMEBODY DINO CITY SCHOOL TO TALK TO YOU TODAY EARLIER THIRTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS. AND ALL ACROSS OUR WHOLE COUNTY. THERE SEVEN SUPPERS AND IT AMOUNTS TO THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AN ENCROACHMENT. DO YOU PROCESS WE ARE HIT HEAVY BY DUE PROCESS LAST YEAR WE HAD EIGHTY ONE FILINGS THAT WE HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT THE COST OF THAT. THAT COST US ABOUT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS WE HAD TWENTY OTHER CASES WHERE PARENTS THANK GOODNESS CAME TO US AND SAID WE DON'T WANT TO FILE FOR DUE PROCESS. WE WANT TO USE ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION METHODS AND WE WERE ABLE TO COME TO AN AGREEMENT WITH THOSE PARENTS. WE REALLY SEE A SHIFT IN OUR CULTURE BECAUSE OF THE GRANTS. SO IN THE END I WOULD SUGGEST THAT WE REALLY REALLY DO NEED TO LOOK AT A GROWTH FACTOR OF SOME RECENT SHIFT IN OUR CULTURE BECAUSE OF THE. ADR GRANT EDR GREEN HAS THE FIVE YEAR ADR GRANT FOR TWENTY THOUSAND PER YEAR. WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO BRING pWITH OUR PARENTS AND OUR OUR DISTRICTS TO. REALLY MAKE SOME DIFFERENCES AND DESCENDED CONFERENCES. SO I WOULD RECOMMEND. SOME KIND OF A GROWTH FACTOR BECAUSE AS YOU SAW ADA IS DECLINING AND YET OUR STUDENT POPULATION IT'S SPECIAL IT IS GROWING. WE DESPERATELY NEED EQUALIZATION. PRESCHOOL I HAVE A DAUGHTER WITH AUTISM WHO'S NOW AN ADULT AND I KNOW THAT PRESCHOOL MADE A HUGE HUGE DIFFERENCE FOR HER. INCLUSION THE MORE THAT WE CAN INCLUDE OUR KIDS IN GENERAL AD IN SEVENTY PERCENT OF OUR KIDS ARE IN GENERAL ADS FIFTY OR MORE PERCENT OF THE DAY. SO WE REALLY REALLY NEED TO GIVE THEM ACCESS TO FIRST BEST INSTRUCTION. AND THEN WE REALLY REALLY NEED TO ADVOCATE FOR THE ID A FUNDS SO THAT WE CAN GET AN INCREASE THERE SO WE WON'T JUST HAVE TO BEAR IT AS THE STATE. AND I KNOW EARLIER THIS WEEK JEFF BELL MET WITH US IF YOU DO A LITTLE PICTURE OF A CIRCLE THAT HERE'S THE PIE. HOW DO YOU WANT ME TO CUT SOMEBODY ELSE'S SPICE MAKE YOURS LARGER? SO I WOULD ADVOCATE THAT WE REALLY NEED TO LOOK AT THAT ADDITIONAL REVENUES THAT ARE COMING INTO THE STATE AND SEE WHERE WE CAN TAKE SOME OF THOSE AND PUT THEM IN SPECIAL ED. BECAUSE EVERY TIME YOU GIVE A DOLLAR TO SPECIAL ED YOU'RE NOT TAKING IT AWAY FROM GENERAL. THANK YOU. HI MY NAME IS CALLIE YOUNG AND I AM THE PROUD MOTHER OF A TWENTY ONE YEAR OLD. YOUNG WOMAN WHO HAPPENS TO BE ON A SPECIAL EDUCATION. SHE HAS SEVERAL POLICY AND EPILEPSY SO THIS IS VERY NEAR AND DEAR TO MY HEART I'M GRATEFUL THAT MY REPRESENTATIVES ARE ON. IN THIS HEARING THEY'RE NOT HERE RIGHT NOW THOUGH. DOCTOR PAN AND A MEMBER MCCARTY. I WANT TO THANK YOU GUYS FIRST OF ALL FOR YOUR COURAGE TO TAKE UP THE SUBJECT IT'S HUGE AND A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE DONE A LOT OF WORK ALREADY. AND WHAT REALLY IMPRESSES ME AS A PARENT. AS A TAXPAYER THAT WE HAVE ALL THESE GREAT MINDS. THAT HAVE A LOT OF INFORMATION AND THAT YOU GUYS ARE REALLY TAKING THE TIME TO LISTEN TO THEM. AND AND ASK THE DIFFICULT QUESTIONS WHICH I THINK IS GREAT SO SLOW AND STEADY I DON'T THINK YOU GUYS CAN. MAKE THIS OF. THIS PROBLEM DISAPPEAR QUICKLY. I CAN I CAN I ENCOURAGE YOU TO CONTINUE BRING ALL THE VOICES TO THE TABLE WHAT I'M REALLY MISSING THOUGH IS THE STUDENT VOICE THE YOUNG ADULT WHO SPENT THREE SPECIAL EDUCATION I WOULD BE REALLY NICE TO SEE THEIR VOICE. I'M OF COURSE I THINK EARLY IDENTIFICATION. OF. DELAY AND DISABILITIES AND IN EARLY INTERVENTION IS OUR ONE OF OUR KEYS TO MAKING SURE THAT OUR KIDS GET WHAT THEY NEED ESPECIALLY ON EARLY INTERVENTION. INVOLVES THE FAMILY WHICH IS REALLY IMPORTANT. I'M I ECHO ON THE DEPARTMENT'S. RECOMMENDATION THAT WE HAVE MORE INCLUSIVE OPPORTUNITIES FOR PRESCHOOL WHERE INCLUSION BECOMES THE NORM INSTEAD OF THE EXCEPTION. OF IN. WHICH IT IS AN EXCEPTION IN SCHOOL BUT I CAN TELL YOU AS A PARENT OF A CHILD OF A YOUNG WOMAN WHO'S TWENTY ONE AND. BEAUTIFUL AND GORGEOUS AND. BIG HEART SHE'D SHE'S SHE DOESN'T HAVE A LOT OF FRIENDS. I'M SHE HAS A LOT OF PEOPLE IN OUR LIVES WHICH DOESN'T HAVE A LOT OF FRIENDS. I'M. SUPPORT FOR THE DEDICATED PROFESSIONALS WHO WORK IN EDUCATION WE'VE HAD AN INCREDIBLE EXPERIENCE. FROM GENERAL TEACHERS TO PEOPLE IN THE OFFICE TO OUR SPECIAL I'D PEOPLE IT'S BEEN INCREDIBLE. I'M WE'VE BEEN LUCKY BECAUSE WE WE BELIEVE IN COLLABORATION WHICH I THINK IS THE KEY THE OTHER PART I BELIEVE IN IS PARENTS SHOULD BE INFORMED AND THEY'RE NOT. I'M. BREAKING DOWN THE BARRIERS BETWEEN GENERAL EDUCATION AND SPECIAL EDUCATION I THINK IS SUPER IMPORTANT TO. IT IS KIND OF A TWO SYSTEM AND IT DOESN'T ALWAYS WORK. ULTIMATELY WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT THOUGH IS STUDENT OUTCOMES. IS THE MEASURE OF OUR OUR SUCCESS. OUR CHILDREN HELD A HIGH STANDARDS. ARE THEY ROLLING IN COLLEGE. DO THEY HAVE JOBS I THINK IS REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT. AND FINALLY AS A PARENT MY OTHER JOB MY OTHER ROLE IS WHEN LORNE WAS BORN SHE CHANGED MY LIFE AND I BECAME I HAD JUST GRADUATED FROM LAW SCHOOL. AND I CHANGED WHERE I WAS GOING AND I EVENTUALLY BECAME THE DIRECTOR OF A WARM WIND FAMILY RESOURCE CENTER HERE IN SACRAMENTO AND WE SUPPORT PARENTS IN UNDERSTANDING. THE LAWS AND HOW TO NAVIGATE BUT AS MY COLLEAGUE SAID EARLIER A LOT OF OUR STATE DOES NOT HAVE A LOCAL SUPPORT FOR PARENTS AND THEY'RE DROWNING. AND THEY'RE CONFUSED AND THEY NEED HELP. AND THERE'S PEOPLE WONDER WHY THEY COME TO MEETINGS ANGRY. THEY'RE CONFUSED AND IF WE HAD MORE FORM PARENTS WE WOULD HAVE MORE COLLABORATION SO I WOULD FULLY SUPPORT FULL FUNDING OF THE FAMILY EMPOWERMENT CENTERS THANK YOU FOR THIS. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR GOOD. META VISION TO. YES. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS THERESA BRADLEY AND I'M HERE TODAY TO REPRESENT AT THE CARS PLUS ORGANIZATION. CARS PLUS IS A CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION FOR RESOURCE SPECIALISTS PLUS ALL OTHER SPECIAL EDUCATORS. OUR MEMBERS ARE NOT TRUSTING DISTRICTS THESE DAYS. BECAUSE THE DISTRICTS ARE NOT FOLLOWING THE AT TWENTY EIGHT. HER CASELOAD LAW FOR OUR S. P.. AND I AM HERE TO HAVE YOU LISTEN. AND HOPEFULLY HELP MAKE SURE THAT ALL OF THE FUNDING DOES NOT GET INTO. PUT INTO DISTRICT HANS. OUR MEMBERS ARE HELPING STUDENTS BECAUSE THEY WANT THEM TO BE AN ADVOCATE AND TO BE THE VOICE OF THE STUDENTS. AND SOME TEACHERS ACTUALLY GET IN TROUBLE FOR ADVOCATING FOR THEIR STUDENTS WHEN THEY DO NEED MORE SERVICES. AND IF THE FUNDS WERE SOLELY BEING HANDED OUT BY THE DISTRICT THERE WOULD BE A. SOME PROBLEMS THERE. THERE ARE THE OTHER THING THAT I WANTED TO BRING UP IS THAT IT IS. WOULD BE WONDERFUL TO HAVE A SPECIAL DAY CLASS. CLASS SIZE MAXIMUM. FOR THE CASE LOAD STC TEACHERS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. I CURLING HOLDEN WITH EASTER SEAL I SHOULD DO. EASTER SEALS PROVIDER OF CONCRETE PRIMARILY DISABILITIES HAVING ALMOST A HUNDRED YEARS OLD SO WE WERE STARTED BY. MY PARENTS IN THE ROTARY AND A HUNDRED YEARS LATER WE'RE STILL PROVIDING SERVICES TO FAMILIES. WITH THE DISPELLED INDIVIDUALS WITH A DISABILITY AND THE WHOLE FAMILY SO IT IS A YEAH. INDIVIDUALIZED SUPPORT MODEL. ARE WE PROVIDE EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION. ZERO FIVE I'VE GOTTA SAY THAT IT'S THE INTEGRATED BOTTLE ONLY. AND. CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES ARE GENERALLY ATTEND OF UP TO FORTY PERCENT OF CHILDREN WITH A DISABILITY PARTICIPATING IN WITH TYPICALLY DEVELOPING CHILDREN ALL OF OUR CHILDREN GO TO PUBLIC SCHOOL. AND AND IN INTEGRATED SETTING WHEN THEY ARE TRANSITIONING FROM OUR SERVICES TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS. AND I'VE BEEN VERY IMPRESSED WITH THE MODEL ON AS AN EASTER SEAL PROVIDER MODEL WE DO A LOT OF SERVICES FOR DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES AND REGIONAL CENTER FUNDED SERVICES. BUT I THINK THE OF EARLY CHILDHOOD SERVICES IN THE INTEGRATED MODEL IS PRODUCING AWESOME RESULTS I REALLY ENCOURAGE YOUR SUPPORT. FOR THAT BECAUSE CHILDREN AND FAMILIES ARE EXPECTING TO BE INTEGRATED WHEN THE TRANSITION. AND THEY ARE BEING INTEGRATED. I ALSO THINK SOME OF THE SPECIAL WORKAROUND TRANSITION AGE. CHILDREN IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE BLUEPRINT THAT'S BEEN DEVELOPED IS PRODUCING CEMEX GOING TO BE PRODUCING SOME EXCELLENT ARE. OUT COMES AS WELL SO LIKE ON DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA WHO IS PROMOTING BETTER LOOK AT. OUTCOMES BY TO ENCOURAGE YOU TO REALLY LOOK AT. MEASURABLE OUTCOMES THAT WE CAN LOOK AT THE INVESTMENTS THAT WE'RE MAKING AMTRAK THOSE SO WE CAN CONTINUE HAVE A CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT MODEL. I WOULD IF TIME PERMITS I'D LIKE TO SHARE A FEW COMMENTS ALSO NOT AS A PROVIDER BUT AS A PARENT ABOUT CHILDREN WHO. HAD. DISABLING CONDITIONS AND PARTICIPATED IN SPECIAL ED. ONE OF WHICH IS THE LEARNING DISABILITY I HAVE ON. MY OLDEST DAUGHTER WHO HAS A LEARNING DISABILITY SHE WAS NEVER DIAGNOSED. AND DONT IT CHILDREN SHOULD HAVE TO WAIT TILL FIFTH GRADE I THINK WHEN WE STARTED TO WATCH THAT CURVE COME UP. BECAUSE BY THEN THEY'VE LOST A LOT OF LEARNING OPPORTUNITY. NOW. HAVING BEEN A PARENT OF A CHILD WITH A LEARNING DISABILITY I'VE GOT TO SAY WE COMPENSATED AND SHE IS NOT GOING TO GET HER PHD. AND IN IN THAT ENGINE EDUCATOR. BUT WE'VE COME A LONG WAY HERE AND OUR ABILITY TO DIAGNOSE INTO DIAGNOSED EARLIER. AND SO WHATEVER WE CAN DO ONE OUT. HILLARY HAD LIKE TO ENCOURAGE THAT WE DO THAT SO WE GET CHILDREN IDENTIFIED IN AN EARLIER AGE SO THEY DON'T HAVE TO START GETTING MESSAGES OF NOT BEING AS COMPETENT LATER. I ALSO HAD A CHILD WHO PARTICIPATED IN SPECIAL EDUCATION. I HE DID HAVE A INTEGRATED MODEL THEY PULLED HIM OUT FOR SERVICES. AND DUMB. HE IS NOW ARM IN CHARGE OF SIGN LANGUAGE INTERPRETERS CROSS THE COUNTRY'S WAS WORKING FOR. EIGHT. A COMPANY AND HE'S A SUPERVISOR FOR HUNDREDS OF OF.

THE MORE MINUTES. ON ON MY CAMPUS THE STUDENTS HAVE MORE CERTAIN MINUTES PER SCHOOL DATE THAN ANY OTHER SCHOOL ON OUR CAMPUS. I MEAN IN OUR DISTRICT.

BETWEEN YOU AND THEM IF YOU DON'T WANT TO VISIT MY CLASSROOM I CAN MAKE ARRANGEMENTS FOR YOU TO SEE SOMEBODY ELSE'S. I'M ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE THAT GETS THE MEDICAL PAPERWORK SIGNED BY THE FAMILIES.

MY CLASS IS THE ONE THAT HAD DOWN SYNDROME AND WE COULD SEE THE. OBVIOUSLY HAD A DISABILITY BECAUSE OF HOW HE LOOKED BECAUSE ITS CHROMOSOMES BUT THE OTHER THREE. THE STAFF ON CAMPUS HAVE TO GO-THROUGH A LOT OF WORK AND A LOT OF.
