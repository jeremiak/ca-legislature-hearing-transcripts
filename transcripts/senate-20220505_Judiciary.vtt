00:08:54.267 --> 00:08:56.435
WHOSE PARENTS HAVE CHOSEN TO

00:08:56.502 --> 00:08:59.405
BLOCK THEM FROM RECEIVING THIS

00:08:59.472 --> 00:09:01.307
POTENTIALLY LIFESAVING VACCINE.

00:09:01.374 --> 00:09:03.476
BAXEEN MISINFORMATION HESITANCY

00:09:03.542 --> 00:09:07.280
HAS ALSO LED TO TRAGIC OUTCOMES

00:09:07.346 --> 00:09:08.314
DURING THE CODE NINETEEN

00:09:08.381 --> 00:09:10.983
PANDEMIC. BUT EVEN IN SITUATIONS

00:09:11.050 --> 00:09:12.318
WHERE PARENTS DON'T HAVE A

00:09:12.385 --> 00:09:14.387
PROBLEM WITH THEIR KIDS GETTING

00:09:14.453 --> 00:09:16.055
VACCINATED IS AND THIS GOAL IS

00:09:16.122 --> 00:09:18.257
NOT JUST ABOUT THE SITUATION

00:09:18.324 --> 00:09:19.992
WHERE A PARENT. IS AGAINST

00:09:20.059 --> 00:09:22.161
VACCINES ARE REFUSING WE KNOW

00:09:22.228 --> 00:09:24.397
THAT UNFORTUNATELY MEDICAL

00:09:24.463 --> 00:09:26.832
NEGLECT OF CHILDREN IS REAL

00:09:26.899 --> 00:09:28.968
THERE ARE FAR TOO MANY FAMILIES

00:09:29.035 --> 00:09:30.036
WHERE THE PARENTS ARE SIMPLY

00:09:30.102 --> 00:09:32.571
NEGLECTING THE MEDICAL CARE OF

00:09:32.638 --> 00:09:33.739
THEIR CHILD THEY'RE NOT AGAINST

00:09:33.806 --> 00:09:36.075
VACCINES ARE JUST NEGLECTING

00:09:36.142 --> 00:09:38.477
WAR. SITUATIONS WHERE PARENTS

00:09:38.544 --> 00:09:42.214
SIMPLY CAN'T MAKE THE TIME. TO

00:09:42.281 --> 00:09:43.749
TAKE THEIR KIDS TO BE VACCINATED

00:09:43.816 --> 00:09:45.952
THEY'RE WORKING MULTIPLE JOBS

00:09:46.018 --> 00:09:47.453
IT'S JUST NOT. THEIR HIGHEST

00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:49.655
PRIORITY COMPARED TO EVERYTHING

00:09:49.722 --> 00:09:51.290
ELSE I HAVE GOING ON IN LIFE.

00:09:51.357 --> 00:09:53.092
AND SO THE KID MAY NOT GET BACK

00:09:53.159 --> 00:09:55.061
SENATE. WHERE THERE MIGHT BE A

00:09:55.127 --> 00:09:56.829
DELAY OF SEVERAL MONTHS BEFORE

00:09:56.896 --> 00:09:59.565
THEY'RE VACCINATED WHICH CAN

00:09:59.632 --> 00:10:02.034
HAVE TERRIBLE CONSEQUENCES. WE

00:10:02.101 --> 00:10:04.003
KNOW THAT SINCE MARCH OF TWENTY

00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:05.438
TWENTY CALIFORNIA HAS

00:10:05.504 --> 00:10:06.973
EXPERIENCED MORE THAN EIGHT

00:10:07.039 --> 00:10:09.442
MILLION CONFIRMED CASES OF CODE.

00:10:09.508 --> 00:10:13.312
AT ALMOST NINETY THOUSAND DEATHS

00:10:13.379 --> 00:10:13.879
NINETY THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS

00:10:13.946 --> 00:10:16.248
HAVE DIED. BOB SINCE DATA

00:10:16.315 --> 00:10:17.450
DEMONSTRATES AN UNVACCINATED

00:10:17.516 --> 00:10:19.452
PEOPLE ARE STILL ALMOST NINE

00:10:19.518 --> 00:10:21.020
TIMES MORE LIKELY TO DIE FROM

00:10:21.087 --> 00:10:23.756
CODED THAN PEOPLE WHO RECEIVE

00:10:23.823 --> 00:10:26.525
THE ROOSTER DOES. NEARLY ONE

00:10:26.592 --> 00:10:29.962
MILLION CALIFORNIA TEENAGERS ARE

00:10:30.029 --> 00:10:32.098
UNVACCINATED FOR COVERT HAVING A

00:10:32.164 --> 00:10:34.033
LARGE NUMBER OF UNVACCINATED

00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:37.203
TEENS UNDERMINES PUBLIC HEALTH

00:10:37.269 --> 00:10:38.704
AND INCREASES THE RISK OF

00:10:38.771 --> 00:10:41.107
INFECTION HOSPITALIZATION AND

00:10:41.173 --> 00:10:44.210
DEATH FOR THOSE KIDS BUT ALSO

00:10:44.276 --> 00:10:45.878
FOR OTHERS AROUND THEM. THESE

00:10:45.945 --> 00:10:47.813
LOW VACCINATION RATES KIND OF

00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:50.483
DIRE CONSEQUENCES A RECENT STUDY

00:10:50.549 --> 00:10:51.951
OF FOUR HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE

00:10:52.018 --> 00:10:54.587

AND SEVENTEEN PUBLISHED IN THE

00:10:55.654 --> 00:10:57.523
NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE

00:10:57.590 --> 00:10:59.592
FOUND THAT ALMOST ALL TEENAGERS

00:10:59.658 --> 00:11:01.093
WHO NEED INTENSIVE CARE FOR

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:03.796
COVER NINETEEN WERE UNVACCINATED

00:11:03.863 --> 00:11:06.298
AND ALL SEVEN WHO DIED. WERE

00:11:06.365 --> 00:11:07.633
UNVACCINATED. THIS

00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:10.703
HOSPITALIZATIONS AND DEATHS ARE

00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:12.705
PREVENTABLE TO ADD TO BE CLEAR.

00:11:12.772 --> 00:11:14.340
THIS BILL IS NOT ONLY ABOUT CODE

00:11:14.407 --> 00:11:15.875
THE CODE BAXEEN ABOUT OTHER

00:11:15.941 --> 00:11:18.244
VACCINES AS WELL BUT WE KNOW THE

00:11:18.310 --> 00:11:19.812
COVE IT IS FRONT AND CENTER

00:11:19.879 --> 00:11:22.782
STILL BECAUSE THE PANDEMIC IS

00:11:22.848 --> 00:11:24.583
NOT OVER- AND WALLS EMPIRICAL

00:11:24.650 --> 00:11:26.819
EVIDENCE IS STILL EMERGING-

00:11:26.886 --> 00:11:28.854
REGARDING THE IMPACTS OF COOKING

00:11:28.921 --> 00:11:30.122
NINETEEN RELATED SCHOOL CLOSURES

00:11:30.189 --> 00:11:31.891
ON YOUTH. MOST STUDIES HAVE

00:11:31.957 --> 00:11:33.526
FOUND NEGATIVE IMPACTS OF THESE

00:11:33.592 --> 00:11:36.028
CLOSURES ON TEAMS MENTAL HEALTH

BASED ACADEMIC DISPARITIES AND

00:11:40.166 --> 00:11:42.501
VACCINATION IS ONE METHOD OF

00:11:42.568 --> 00:11:44.837
MAKING SURE THAT OUR SCHOOLS DO

00:11:44.904 --> 00:11:48.541

00:11:54.246 --> 00:11:55.314

I DID NOT HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO

VACCINATE MYSELF I LOST MY JOB.

00:14:06.478 --> 00:14:08.247

FORCE TO TAKE A GAP YEAR FROM

THAN TWO MILLION DEATHS PER YEAR

00:23:14.893 --> 00:23:16.328
. YET THESE VACCINE PREVENTABLE

DISEASES ARE STILL AROUND AND

00:23:17.696 --> 00:23:19.698
THEY REMAIN A THREAT. IN MY

VACCINES MANY DO NOT REALIZE

00:23:46.458 --> 00:23:48.160
THAT COVERT NINETEEN CAN BE

00:23:48.226 --> 00:23:50.295
SERIOUS AND CHILDREN. TO DATE

00:23:50.362 --> 00:23:51.429
MORE THAN TWELVE MILLION

00:23:51.496 --> 00:23:53.165
CHILDREN HAVE BEEN INFECTED WITH

00:23:53.231 --> 00:23:54.766
COVERT IN THE U. S. AND THIS IS

00:23:54.833 --> 00:23:56.134
RESULTED IN MORE THAN FORTY

00:23:56.201 --> 00:23:57.669
THOUSAND HOSPITALIZATIONS. AND

00:23:57.736 --> 00:23:59.538
MORE THAN FIFTEEN HUNDRED DEATHS

pWE'RE TALKING TODAY SIX HUNDRED

DIE FROM COVERT HERE AND

00:24:17.489 --> 00:24:18.523
CALIFORNIA. IMMUNIZATION RATES

00:24:18.590 --> 00:24:20.258
ARE SUBOPTIMAL DUE TO A VARIETY

00:24:20.325 --> 00:24:22.060
OF BARRIERS TO SELL ANY CHANGE

00:24:22.127 --> 00:24:23.728

00:24:23.795 --> 00:24:25.630
IMMUNIZATIONS WILL RESULT IN

00:24:25.697 --> 00:24:26.298
IMPROVED HEALTH AND WELLNESS FOR

TWELVE TO SEVENTEEN YEAR OLDS.

00:24:49.354 --> 00:24:50.822
RECEIVING TWO DOSES OF CODE

00:24:50.889 --> 00:24:53.425
VACCINE. THIS IS A REAL TRAGEDY

00:24:53.491 --> 00:24:55.060
SINCE THE CDC REPORTS THAT

00:24:55.126 --> 00:24:56.828
UNVACCINATED PEOPLE TWELVE YEARS

00:24:56.895 --> 00:24:58.964

TIMES INCREASED RISK OF DYING

00:25:00.365 --> 00:25:01.800
FROM COVERT COMPARED TO THOSE

00:25:01.867 --> 00:25:03.735
WHO ARE VACCINATED. AND THAT'S

00:25:03.802 --> 00:25:05.136
WHY IT'S CRITICAL THAT

00:25:05.203 --> 00:25:06.771

02:43:44.147 --> 02:43:45.882
TAKES THE VIEW THAT THE-

02:43:45.949 --> 02:43:48.118
DECISION OUT OF THE DC COURT-

02:43:48.185 --> 02:43:50.420
WAS SIMPLY WRONG. EIGHT HE'S

02:43:50.487 --> 02:43:52.489
CORRECT IN THAT A DECISION FROM

02:43:52.556 --> 02:43:55.692
A LOWER FEDERAL COURT IN DC- IS

02:43:55.759 --> 02:43:58.195
NOT BINDING OR CONTROLLING ON

02:43:58.261 --> 02:43:59.863
THIS BODY. BUT IT CERTAINLY

02:43:59.930 --> 02:44:02.499
PRESENTS SOME LOW HANGING FRUIT

02:44:02.566 --> 02:44:03.967
TO THOSE OF US WHO ARE READY-

02:44:04.034 --> 02:44:07.504
PERCEIVE A LOT OF AND ILLEGALITY

02:44:07.571 --> 02:44:09.372
WITHIN A S. S. B. EIGHT SIXTY

02:44:09.439 --> 02:44:12.175
SIX- IT LAYS OUT A- PRETTY

02:44:12.242 --> 02:44:14.911
EXTENSIVE. FRAMEWORK FOR HOW TO

02:44:14.978 --> 02:44:17.414
ATTACK THIS BILL. AND GET TO

02:44:17.480 --> 02:44:20.250
SOME OF THAT GENERAL INTEREST

02:44:20.317 --> 02:44:21.685
POINTS EIGHT IN. OF COURSE THERE

02:44:21.751 --> 02:44:24.354
ARE DISTINCTIONS BETWEEN THE LAW

02:44:24.421 --> 02:44:26.056
THAT WAS PASSED IN DC COMMITTEE

02:44:26.122 --> 02:44:27.557
ANALYSIS PICKED UP ON THIS AS

02:44:27.624 --> 02:44:29.159
WELL. I OF COURSE THERE ARE

02:44:29.226 --> 02:44:32.762
DISTINCTIONS BETWEEN S. B. EIGHT

02:44:32.829 --> 02:44:34.497
SIXTY SIX IN ALL OF THE OTHER

02:44:34.564 --> 02:44:35.565
STATE LAWS AND RECITED. IN

02:44:35.632 --> 02:44:38.602
SUPPORT OF IT IS- AUTHORIZING

02:44:38.668 --> 02:44:41.571
VARIOUS TYPES OF- HEALTH

02:44:41.638 --> 02:44:43.607
EMANCIPATION IF YOU WILL FOR

02:44:43.673 --> 02:44:44.474
MINORS AND OTHER STATES THERE

02:44:44.541 --> 02:44:46.710
ARE ALWAYS SOME DISTINCTIONS.

02:44:46.776 --> 02:44:49.579
BUT WHAT YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT AND

02:44:49.646 --> 02:44:51.281
YOU KNOW WE KNOW AS LAWYERS WE

02:44:51.348 --> 02:44:53.250
ASK OURSELVES. ARE THESE

02:44:53.316 --> 02:44:54.417
DISTINCTIONS WITHOUT A

02:44:54.484 --> 02:44:55.452
DIFFERENCE. AND I WOULD SUBMIT

02:44:55.518 --> 02:44:57.420
THAT THE ARE PARTICULARLY

02:44:57.487 --> 02:45:00.156
BECAUSE OF THE INSIDES OF THE

02:45:00.223 --> 02:45:03.393
FEDERAL JUDGE IN DC AND ECHOING

02:45:03.460 --> 02:45:05.595
THAT IS A LEADER TO EARLIER. OF

02:45:05.662 --> 02:45:06.596
SOME OF THE SAME KINDS OF

02:45:06.663 --> 02:45:07.864
CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN

02:45:07.931 --> 02:45:10.433
PRESENTED. IN THE OPPOSITION

02:45:10.500 --> 02:45:13.603
SUBMITTED TO THE COMMITTEE ON

02:45:13.670 --> 02:45:15.338
THE FOR INSTANCE WHAT YOU HEARD

02:45:15.405 --> 02:45:16.873
FROM PARENTS AS WELL AS FROM

02:45:16.940 --> 02:45:20.143
OTHERS. ABOUT THE BACKGROUND OF

02:45:20.210 --> 02:45:23.446
KIDS WHO DON'T KNOW THEIR OWN.

02:45:23.513 --> 02:45:25.315
MEDICAL HISTORY ESPECIALLY FROM

02:45:25.382 --> 02:45:26.716
A YOUNG AGE THAT'S SOMETHING

02:45:26.783 --> 02:45:30.954
THAT THE COURT IN. DC PICKED UP

02:45:31.021 --> 02:45:32.856
ON. IT SO THE THING THAT I THE

02:45:32.922 --> 02:45:34.024
KEY THE COURTS HERE WOULD BE

02:45:34.090 --> 02:45:36.026
VERY. ATTUNED AND SO- I THINK

02:45:36.092 --> 02:45:37.861
THAT'S WHY THE DECISION FROM THE

02:45:37.927 --> 02:45:39.529
DC COURT WOULD JUST ENCOURAGE-

02:45:39.596 --> 02:45:41.564
ALL OF YOU TO TAKE A LOOK AT

02:45:41.631 --> 02:45:42.866

ARE- AND WHAT THE SIMILARITIES

02:45:46.102 --> 02:45:47.737
ARE IN. I BELIEVE YOU'LL FIND

02:45:47.804 --> 02:45:50.473

DC CASE HAS BEEN. ON THE WALL

02:46:55.372 --> 02:46:57.107
BUT I WOULD LIKE TO ASK A LITTLE

02:46:57.173 --> 02:47:00.977
ABOUT THE ACTUAL. PROGRAM IS

02:47:01.044 --> 02:47:03.713
THERE EVIDENCE. THAT SOME OF THE

02:47:03.780 --> 02:47:05.715
CONCERNS THAT WERE EXPRESSED

02:47:05.782 --> 02:47:08.752
HERE. ARE CAME INTO PLAY IN DC

02:47:08.818 --> 02:47:10.954
WHEN THE AGE OF CONSENT WAS

02:47:11.020 --> 02:47:12.722
ELEVEN WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED

02:47:12.789 --> 02:47:15.925
WAS IT CONSIDERED A SUCCESS WHAT

02:47:15.992 --> 02:47:20.864
WERE THE ISSUES. BUT I MEAN I.

02:47:20.930 --> 02:47:23.533
THE THAT WOULD BE A QUESTION FOR

02:47:23.600 --> 02:47:24.467
THE WASHINGTON DC OF A FALSE OR

02:47:24.534 --> 02:47:26.269
THAT'S WHAT I WAS SUGGESTING TO

02:47:26.336 --> 02:47:29.572
YOUR WAS GONNA YES WE- I'VE NOT

02:47:29.639 --> 02:47:34.978

02:47:35.044 --> 02:47:37.580
AND- WE CERTAINLY CAN ACQUIRE-

02:47:37.647 --> 02:47:40.750
WITH WATCHINGWHAT DC OFFICIALS

02:47:40.817 --> 02:47:42.719
BUT WE'VE NOT HEARD OF ANY FIVE

02:47:42.786 --> 02:47:44.053
ARE ARE OBVIOUSLY SUGGEST IF

02:47:44.120 --> 02:47:45.522
THERE'D BEEN PROBLEMS WE WOULD

02:47:45.588 --> 02:47:46.956
HAVE HEARD ABOUT IT IN THE LIKE

02:47:47.023 --> 02:47:48.391
THE TESTIMONY BUT IT STILL WAS

02:47:48.458 --> 02:47:50.927
A- MATTER. DURING THE OPINIONS

02:47:50.994 --> 02:47:52.829
OF PROBLEMS HERE TWENTY OPINIONS

02:47:52.896 --> 02:47:55.465
THEN THEN A SIMILAR QUESTION

02:47:55.532 --> 02:47:57.534
BECAUSE WE HAVE THE EARLIER AGE

02:47:57.600 --> 02:47:59.202
OF CONSENT IN CALIFORNIA FOR

02:47:59.269 --> 02:48:01.204
MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT WITH THE

02:48:01.271 --> 02:48:02.705
EARLIER AGE OF CONSENT IN

02:48:02.772 --> 02:48:04.808

TRANSMITTED DISEASES HAVE WE

02:48:06.509 --> 02:48:09.946
HEARD. OF THAT THEIR ROLE.

02:48:10.013 --> 02:48:11.748
ISSUES THAT WOULD TURN ON THIS

02:48:11.815 --> 02:48:13.983
THAT HAVE COME OUT OF BOTH OF

02:48:14.050 --> 02:48:16.886
THOSE NO WE WOULD NOT AND WHAT I

02:48:16.953 --> 02:48:19.856
WILL SAY IS IN THIS WHOLE NOTION

02:48:19.923 --> 02:48:20.457
THAT KIDS DON'T KNOW ANYTHING

02:48:20.523 --> 02:48:22.859
ABOUT THEIR HEALTH HISTORY- YOU

02:48:22.926 --> 02:48:24.027
COULD SAY THAT WELL THEY

02:48:24.093 --> 02:48:25.862
SHOULDN'T BE ABLE TO GO AND

02:48:25.929 --> 02:48:27.730
PICK. YOU KNOW OUR DOMESTIC

02:48:27.797 --> 02:48:28.998
VIOLENCE HEALTH CARE PHYSICAL

02:48:29.065 --> 02:48:30.700
TREATMENT WOULD THANK YOU FOR

02:48:30.767 --> 02:48:32.368
SERIOUS INJURY BECAUSE THEY

02:48:32.435 --> 02:48:33.703
DON'T THEY CAN'T RECITE THEIR

02:48:33.770 --> 02:48:36.372
OWN- HISTORY AND I'M SURE THEIR

02:48:36.439 --> 02:48:38.074
KIDS BACK OR GREATER RECITING

02:48:38.141 --> 02:48:39.476
THEIR OWN HEALTH CARE HISTORY

02:48:39.542 --> 02:48:41.010
ABOUT YOUR EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD I

02:48:41.077 --> 02:48:42.812
BET YOU THERE ARE SEVEN YEAR

02:48:42.879 --> 02:48:44.013
OLDS WHO CAN'T RECITE OR CAN'T

02:48:44.080 --> 02:48:45.648
REMEMBER THEIR ENTIRE HEALTHCARE

02:48:45.715 --> 02:48:46.950
HISTORY I CAN SAY WITH

02:48:47.016 --> 02:48:48.751
CONFIDENCE A FIFTY ONE. BUT I

02:48:48.818 --> 02:48:49.686
CAN REMEMBER EVERYTHING THAT

02:48:49.752 --> 02:48:51.221
HAPPENED TO ME THE ENTIRE FIFTY

02:48:51.287 --> 02:48:53.857
ONE YEARS THAT I'VE BEEN ALIVE

02:48:53.923 --> 02:48:56.159
AND SO I YOU KNOW I THINK THAT

02:48:56.226 --> 02:48:58.094
PEOPLE PERFECT HEALTH CARE

02:48:58.161 --> 02:49:04.634
PROFESSIONALS. ARE TRAINED. TO

02:49:04.701 --> 02:49:07.103
ASK. AND TO AND TO HELP DEAL AND

02:49:07.170 --> 02:49:09.138
PEOPLE WHO MAY NOT RE EVERYTHING

02:49:09.205 --> 02:49:10.073
THAT'S A VERY VERY COMMON.

02:49:10.139 --> 02:49:12.542
SITUATION FOR IT I THINK FOR ANY

02:49:12.609 --> 02:49:13.843
KIND OF HEALTH CARE PROVIDED

02:49:13.910 --> 02:49:15.778
THAT THERE ARE TIMES THAT YOU

02:49:15.845 --> 02:49:16.279
HAVE A PTIENT. THAT FOR

02:49:16.346 --> 02:49:18.047
WHATEVER REASON DOESN'T KNOW

02:49:18.114 --> 02:49:19.449
EVERYTHING ABOUT THEIR OWN

02:49:19.516 --> 02:49:20.917
HEALTH CARE HISTORY OR CAN'T

02:49:20.984 --> 02:49:23.219
REMEMBER EVERYTHING OR MIGHT

02:49:23.286 --> 02:49:25.522
MISS REMEMBER. AND SAY ONE THING

02:49:25.588 --> 02:49:26.523
BUT REALLY SOMETHING ELSE

02:49:26.589 --> 02:49:28.591
HAPPENED. AND HEALTH CARE

02:49:28.658 --> 02:49:30.059
PROFESSIONALS ARE TRAINED HOW TO

02:49:30.126 --> 02:49:32.328
NAVIGATE THAT AND SO THE BILL

02:49:32.395 --> 02:49:33.596
AND HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS

02:49:33.663 --> 02:49:35.031
HAVE BEEN NAVIGATING THE AS YOU

02:49:35.098 --> 02:49:37.333
KNOW SENATOR- AROUND MENTAL

02:49:37.400 --> 02:49:39.302
HEALTH AND OTHER AREAS OF HEALTH

02:49:39.369 --> 02:49:40.904
CARE. FOR A LONG TIME AND SO

02:49:40.970 --> 02:49:42.972
THEY KNOW HOW TO DO IT. I DON'T

02:49:43.039 --> 02:49:45.942
KNOW HOW TO DO IT HERE. WELL

02:49:46.009 --> 02:49:48.745
THERE WAS A- YOU KNOW THE VOTERS

02:49:48.811 --> 02:49:50.513
HAVE VOTED ON. A NUMBER OF TIMES

02:49:50.580 --> 02:49:52.916
THE PARENTAL RIGHTS WITH REGARD

02:49:52.982 --> 02:49:55.418
TO- GETTING REPRODUCTIVE

02:49:55.485 --> 02:49:57.887
SERVICES FOR PEOPLE THAT WERE

02:49:57.954 --> 02:50:00.456
YOUNGER AND ONE OF THE

02:50:00.523 --> 02:50:02.258
INTERESTING POLLING OUT COM

02:50:02.325 --> 02:50:07.063
CIVIL WAR IS THAT IN GENERAL IF

02:50:07.130 --> 02:50:08.665
. PEOPLE FELT BY PARENTS FELT

02:50:08.731 --> 02:50:10.433
LIKE THEY SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT

02:50:10.500 --> 02:50:12.135
FOR THEIR OWN KIDS BUT THEY FELT

02:50:12.201 --> 02:50:13.736
THAT THERE WERE OTHER FAMILY

02:50:13.803 --> 02:50:16.773
STEP. THAT MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN

02:50:16.839 --> 02:50:19.642
AS RESPONSIBLE AND I THOUGHT IT

02:50:19.709 --> 02:50:21.678
WAS IMPORTANT TO GRANT THAT IN

02:50:21.744 --> 02:50:23.780
THE BALLOT BECAUSE OF WHAT THEY

02:50:23.846 --> 02:50:25.515
THOUGHT MIGHT BE EXISTED IN

02:50:25.582 --> 02:50:28.551
OTHER PLACES A COUPLE OF THINGS

02:50:28.618 --> 02:50:31.487
THAT CAME UP- THERE WAS AN ISSUE

02:50:31.554 --> 02:50:33.623
ABOUT LIABILITY- COULD YOU

02:50:33.690 --> 02:50:35.892
RESPOND TO THE CONCERNS THAT

02:50:35.959 --> 02:50:38.595
WERE EXPRESSED ABOUT. SURE WE

02:50:38.661 --> 02:50:41.097
HAVE- THERE'S A FEDERAL LAW THAT

02:50:41.164 --> 02:50:43.032
COMPLETELY OCCUPIES FIELD AND

02:50:43.099 --> 02:50:45.435
GOVERNS- LIABILITY OR

02:50:45.501 --> 02:50:48.771
COMPENSATION FOR VACCINE INJURY

02:50:48.838 --> 02:50:51.040
OCCURS ARE EXTREMELY RARE AND

02:50:51.107 --> 02:50:53.443
WHEN THEY DO OCCUR THERE IS A

02:50:53.509 --> 02:50:54.711
FEDERAL PROCESS FOR SEEKING

02:50:54.777 --> 02:50:56.746
COMPENSATION AND NOT APPLY HERE.

02:50:56.813 --> 02:50:58.781
BECAUSE NUMBER KIDS HAVE BEEN

02:50:58.848 --> 02:51:01.684
VACCINATED FOR A LONG TIME- AND

02:51:01.751 --> 02:51:02.885
SOMETIMES ON THEIR OWN EACH

02:51:02.952 --> 02:51:06.089
PEOPLE YOU'RE HAPPY- OTHERWISE A

02:51:06.155 --> 02:51:08.057
PARENT OR GUARDIAN AND OF A

02:51:08.124 --> 02:51:10.360
VACCINE INJURY OCCURS THERE IS A

02:51:10.426 --> 02:51:12.929
PROCESS TO GO THROUGH- TO GET

02:51:12.996 --> 02:51:14.864
COMPENSATION AND THIS DOESN'T IN

02:51:14.931 --> 02:51:17.700
ANY WAY CHANGE I. AND SO THAT

02:51:17.767 --> 02:51:19.369
THAT LIABILITY SYSTEM IS WHAT IT

02:51:19.435 --> 02:51:21.571
IS A REMAIN THAT WAY THE BILL

02:51:21.638 --> 02:51:23.206
DOESN'T CHANGE NOR COULD REACH

02:51:23.272 --> 02:51:24.874
BUT THERE WAS AN IMPLICATION IN

02:51:24.941 --> 02:51:26.876
THE TESTIMONY THAT SOME HOW

02:51:26.943 --> 02:51:28.544
DOCTORS ARE FAMILIES WOULDN'T

02:51:28.611 --> 02:51:31.047
KNOW WHAT THIS BILL PASSED WELL

02:51:31.114 --> 02:51:36.919
AND SO. DOES THAT. PREJUDICE

02:51:36.986 --> 02:51:38.655
THAT YOUR STATE YEAH AND IT THIS

02:51:38.721 --> 02:51:40.323

02:51:45.061 --> 02:51:47.697
CONFIDENTIALITY LAW- LIMITING

02:51:47.764 --> 02:51:50.566
WHAT A PARENT IS ALLOWED TO KNOW

CARE TREATMENT WITHOUT THE

02:51:53.236 --> 02:51:55.772
CONSENT. OF THE CHILD NOT

EXISTING LAW ONE SECURE TERMS

CONCERNS PEOPLE HAVE ABOUT THAT

02:52:07.750 --> 02:52:12.755
THAT EXISTS. TODAY IF A KID HAS

02:52:12.822 --> 02:52:13.690
AN ADVERSE REACTION. THAT'S NOT

02:52:13.756 --> 02:52:16.726
GOING BE. A SECRET IN TERMS OF

02:52:16.793 --> 02:52:18.828
COMPENSATION POTENTIALLY AND

02:52:18.895 --> 02:52:20.697
THEIR PARENTS WHAT EVERY ABILITY

02:52:20.763 --> 02:52:23.032
TO FILE FOR COMPENSATION FOR

02:52:23.099 --> 02:52:26.969
THAT CHILD. AND YOU YOU

02:52:27.036 --> 02:52:30.707
INDICATED THAT THAT YOU BELIEVE

02:52:30.773 --> 02:52:32.575
THAT THAT IS RARE. THE DEAD THE

02:52:32.642 --> 02:52:34.744
FACT THAT THIRD ENTRIES A RARE

02:52:34.811 --> 02:52:39.582
AND YET THERE WAS- TESTIMONY

02:52:39.649 --> 02:52:41.584
BELIEVED THAT IT HAPPENED TO

02:52:41.651 --> 02:52:44.454
THEIR KIDS HOW DO YOU PROPOSE TO

02:52:44.520 --> 02:52:47.890
GO. NO ONE ARGUES THAT VACCINE

02:52:47.957 --> 02:52:50.193
INJURIES NEVER HAPPENED WITH THE

02:52:50.259 --> 02:52:52.395
DATE THAT THAT NO ONE IS SAYING

02:52:52.462 --> 02:52:55.098
THAT AND THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE

02:52:55.164 --> 02:52:57.734
TESTIFIED ABOUT THEIR KIDS. BUT

02:52:57.800 --> 02:53:00.570
THAT'S BETTER EXPERIENCE AND I'M

02:53:00.636 --> 02:53:02.271
NOT IN ANY WAY DISPUTING WHAT

02:53:02.338 --> 02:53:06.142
THEY SAID ABOUT THEIR CHILD- BUT

02:53:06.209 --> 02:53:08.211
- THERE'S ALSO THE TENS OF

02:53:08.277 --> 02:53:10.813
HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS. OF

02:53:10.880 --> 02:53:12.648
CHILDREN WHO WERE VACCINATED.

02:53:12.715 --> 02:53:15.218
WE'RE NOT BOXING INJURED. AND

02:53:15.284 --> 02:53:16.619
WHO WERE ABLE TO AVOID.

02:53:16.686 --> 02:53:18.788
ATTENTIONAL GETTING VERY SICK OR

02:53:18.855 --> 02:53:22.492
DYING FROM MEASLES- HI I IMAGINE

02:53:22.558 --> 02:53:24.627
THAT THERE ARE RARE INSTANCES IN

02:53:24.694 --> 02:53:25.628
WHICH THE POLIO VACCINE HARM

02:53:25.695 --> 02:53:28.331
SOMEONE BUT BUT THAT AGAINST ALL

02:53:28.397 --> 02:53:29.532
THE CHILDREN THAT WOULD HAVE

02:53:29.599 --> 02:53:31.901
BEEN DEBILITATED PARALYZED OR

02:53:31.968 --> 02:53:35.838
DEAD. HAD WE NOT HAD A MASS

02:53:35.905 --> 02:53:37.774
VACCINATION CAMPAIGN FOR POLIO.

02:53:37.840 --> 02:53:39.709
AND SOYOU YOU LOOK AT THOSE

02:53:39.776 --> 02:53:42.245
INJURIES. I'M EMPLOYEE WAS A

02:53:42.311 --> 02:53:44.313
GREAT EXAMPLE I WASN'T I WASN'T

02:53:44.380 --> 02:53:46.082
ALIVE DURING THE HORRIBLE YOU

02:53:46.149 --> 02:53:48.684
MIGHT PARENTS OR- GRANDPARENTS

02:53:48.751 --> 02:53:50.153
OF TALK TO ME ABOUT IT. THE

02:53:50.219 --> 02:53:52.421
ABSOLUTE NIGHTMARE AND FEAR THAT

02:53:52.488 --> 02:53:55.158
SOCIETY LIVE FOR KNOWING EVERY

02:53:55.224 --> 02:53:57.627
YEAR. THAT SOME NUMBER OF KIDS

02:53:57.693 --> 02:53:59.562
WE'RE GONNA GET POLIO AND THEY

02:53:59.629 --> 02:54:01.030
MIGHT NO LONGER BE ABLE TO USE

02:54:01.097 --> 02:54:02.765
THEIR ARMS THEY MIGHT NOT BE

02:54:02.832 --> 02:54:04.100
ABLE TO WALK ANYMORE OR THEY

02:54:04.167 --> 02:54:06.869
MIGHT DIE MIT POWER ALLIES. I

02:54:06.936 --> 02:54:08.805
THANK GOD WE GOT THE POLIO

02:54:08.871 --> 02:54:10.173
VACCINE ACTUALLY DID A MASS

02:54:10.239 --> 02:54:11.641
VACCINATION CAMPAIGN. AND WE

02:54:11.707 --> 02:54:13.176
DIDN'T HAVE SOCIAL MEDIA TO

02:54:13.242 --> 02:54:15.745
SPREAD MASS MISINFORMATION ABOUT

02:54:15.812 --> 02:54:18.414
THE POLIO VACCINE. AND CONGRESS

02:54:18.481 --> 02:54:20.750
SET UP A COMPENSATION STRUCTURE

02:54:20.817 --> 02:54:23.219
FOR THE VERY RARE INSTANCE IN

02:54:23.286 --> 02:54:24.387
WHICH SOMEONE IS INJURED. BUT

02:54:24.453 --> 02:54:26.422
HOW MANY MILLIONS AND MILLIONS

02:54:26.489 --> 02:54:28.057
AND MILLIONS AND TENS OF

02:54:28.124 --> 02:54:30.092
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE ARE EITHER

02:54:30.159 --> 02:54:32.528
ALIVE OR NOT PARALYZED TODAY.

02:54:32.595 --> 02:54:34.864
BECAUSE WE HAD A MASS POLIO

02:54:34.931 --> 02:54:36.132
VACCINATION CAMPAIGN. AND

02:54:36.199 --> 02:54:37.700
BECAUSE WE LET PEOPLE GET

02:54:37.767 --> 02:54:40.303
VACCINATED SO I AM NOT ANYWAY

02:54:40.369 --> 02:54:42.572
SAYING THAT. THE PEOPLE'S

02:54:42.638 --> 02:54:43.940
EXPERIENCE AND THEIR LIFE

02:54:44.006 --> 02:54:46.008
EXPERIENCE AND WHAT AND AS A KID

02:54:46.075 --> 02:54:48.211
WAS INJURED. THAT BAD THAT'S A

02:54:48.277 --> 02:54:51.047
TERRIBLE THING AND THAT IS WHAT

02:54:51.113 --> 02:54:52.081
THEY HAVE ARE LIVING WITH AND I

02:54:52.148 --> 02:54:54.150
AND I HONOR THAT AND I'M NOT

02:54:54.217 --> 02:54:57.486
THIS. THAT IN ANY WAY. BUT THEN

02:54:57.553 --> 02:54:59.755
WE HAVE TO AT THE BIG PICTURE OF

02:54:59.822 --> 02:55:01.624
THE MANY NNE OF. WHO HAVE

02:55:01.691 --> 02:55:04.927
HEALTHIER LIVES NOW BECAUSE

02:55:04.994 --> 02:55:06.329
EGGMAN OXIDATIVE. AND THEN

02:55:06.395 --> 02:55:08.564
MISTER CHAIR BUT TO MAKE. I

02:55:08.631 --> 02:55:09.899
THINK ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT

02:55:09.966 --> 02:55:13.436
THINGS- ABOUT BEING IN THE

02:55:13.502 --> 02:55:15.271
LEGISLATURE. IS THAT THERE ARE

02:55:15.338 --> 02:55:16.906
CERTAIN TIMES THAT ISSUES ARE

02:55:16.973 --> 02:55:19.041
REPRESENTED TO BE BLACK AND

02:55:19.108 --> 02:55:20.409
WHITE. BUT IT IS ACTUALLY THE

02:55:20.476 --> 02:55:22.311
PRACTICAL CHOICE OF WHAT'S IN

02:55:22.378 --> 02:55:23.913
FRONT OF US IT HAPPENED THIS

02:55:23.980 --> 02:55:27.383
MORNING ON THE FLOOR- BECAUSE

02:55:27.450 --> 02:55:28.985
THE MICRO ITEM THAT CAME IN

02:55:29.051 --> 02:55:31.020
FRONT OF THIS IT WAS A CHOICE.

02:55:31.087 --> 02:55:32.755
BETWEEN THIS BIG COMPROMISE AND

02:55:32.822 --> 02:55:34.790
WHAT WOULD GO TO THE BALLOT IT

02:55:34.857 --> 02:55:36.726
WASN'T A CHOICE. REALLY BETWEEN

02:55:36.792 --> 02:55:39.195
THE CURRENT SITUATION. AND THAT

02:55:39.262 --> 02:55:41.197
COMPROMISE AND IT ON THE

02:55:41.264 --> 02:55:44.500
ENVIRONMENTAL WORLD TICKETS IT

02:55:44.567 --> 02:55:46.569
WHEN TREES DIE. OF THE BIOMASS

02:55:46.636 --> 02:55:48.871
PROCESS IS NOT ENVIRONMENTALLY

02:55:48.938 --> 02:55:51.707
SOUND BUT THOSE TREES HUNDRED

02:55:51.774 --> 02:55:52.308
TWENTY NINE MILLION TREES ARE

02:55:52.375 --> 02:55:54.243
GOING TO JURY FORCED TO CREATE

02:55:54.310 --> 02:55:56.445
METHOD SO IT'S A CHOICE BETWEEN.

02:55:56.512 --> 02:55:57.280
SOMETHING THAT MIGHT NOT BE

02:55:57.346 --> 02:56:00.483
ENVIRONMENTALLY SOUND BIOMASS IT

02:56:00.549 --> 02:56:07.723
AND THAT. IT AND. D. G. YOU JUST

02:56:07.790 --> 02:56:09.125
READ TO YOUR PARENTS HI EITHER

02:56:09.191 --> 02:56:11.160
EIGHT OR NINE. WHEN OURS IN LINE

02:56:11.227 --> 02:56:15.464
AND A POLIO Q. A SUGAR WITH

02:56:15.531 --> 02:56:18.167
POLICE. AND IT WAS- AND THERE

02:56:18.234 --> 02:56:20.102
WAS A IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD THAT

02:56:20.169 --> 02:56:23.105
GOT POLIO BEFORE WE DID THAT

02:56:23.172 --> 02:56:25.608
NUMBER IN THAT CASE IT IS A MORE

02:56:25.675 --> 02:56:27.310
MINOR THING BUT HE COULDN'T LIST

02:56:27.376 --> 02:56:28.744
ARMS OR ABOVE A CERTAIN LEVEL.

02:56:28.811 --> 02:56:32.915
AND IT WAS A VERY VERY REAL FEAR

02:56:32.982 --> 02:56:37.153
. WE ALL FELT LIKE AS KIDS WE

02:56:37.219 --> 02:56:38.688
WERE SUBJECT TO THAT. AND SO

02:56:38.754 --> 02:56:41.223
THEN ONCE AGAIN IT BECOMES A

02:56:41.290 --> 02:56:43.626
CHOICE IS IT IT IS A CHOICE

02:56:43.693 --> 02:56:45.861
BETWEEN. THE POSSIBILITY OF

02:56:45.928 --> 02:56:48.664
HAVING THAT SITUATION. FOR THE

02:56:48.731 --> 02:56:50.800
MASS VACCINATION WITH WHICH IN

02:56:50.866 --> 02:56:53.202
ESSENCE PREVENTED IT FOR MANY OF

02:56:53.269 --> 02:56:54.937
US IN IN WHAT WOULD HAVE

02:56:55.004 --> 02:56:57.206
HAPPENED AND I THINK. THAT'S THE

02:56:57.273 --> 02:56:58.607
DIFFICULTY ABOUT THIS AND IT

02:56:58.674 --> 02:57:00.710
WASN'T. NECESSARILY REPRESENTED

02:57:00.776 --> 02:57:02.244
IN SOME OF THE TESTIMONY BECAUSE

02:57:02.311 --> 02:57:03.512
IT WAS REPRESENTED AS AN

02:57:03.579 --> 02:57:06.248
ABSOLUTE. WHAT WHEN THERE'S A

02:57:06.315 --> 02:57:08.651
GRADIENT OF CHOICE HERE. IT IS

02:57:08.718 --> 02:57:11.420
AN WHAT IT IS AND THERE THERE IS

02:57:11.487 --> 02:57:12.989
AN IT I REMEMBER WHEN I WAS IN

02:57:13.055 --> 02:57:15.958
THERE AND WE HAD A SIMILAR

02:57:16.025 --> 02:57:17.927
CONTENTIOUS HEARING. I HAD TO

02:57:17.994 --> 02:57:19.061
SAY TO SOMEBODY THAT WAS

02:57:19.128 --> 02:57:20.863
TESTIFYING THAT RUDENESS WAS

02:57:20.930 --> 02:57:23.966
JUST NOT PERSUASIVE. AND IT'S

02:57:24.033 --> 02:57:25.568
LIKE I WAS LISTENING CLOSELY TO

02:57:25.634 --> 02:57:27.636
THE TESTIMONY AND IT'S THE

02:57:27.703 --> 02:57:30.873
REASON WHY. I ASKED YOU ABOUT

02:57:30.940 --> 02:57:32.808
SOME OF THE PRACTICAL FACTS THAT

02:57:32.875 --> 02:57:35.244
WERE PRESENTED IN THE TESTIMONY.

02:57:35.311 --> 02:57:38.748
THE WEATHER WAS THE LIABILITY.

02:57:38.814 --> 02:57:40.583
FOR THE REALITIES OF THE DC

02:57:40.649 --> 02:57:43.452
THING AGAINST THE LEGAL PART.

02:57:43.519 --> 02:57:44.954
BECAUSE I THINK THOSE THAT IS

02:57:45.021 --> 02:57:47.556
THE CHOICE IN FRONT OF US AND IT

02:57:47.623 --> 02:57:49.525
IS WEIGHING. A CHOICE THAT IS

02:57:49.592 --> 02:57:51.927
NOT AS CLEAR CUT BUT ONE THAT WE

02:57:51.994 --> 02:57:55.631
HAVE TO DEAL WITH SO. I KNOW IS

02:57:55.698 --> 02:57:57.600
ESSENTIALLY THE STOP. ON A

02:57:57.666 --> 02:57:59.235
LENGTHY DISCUSSION AND I THINK

02:57:59.301 --> 02:58:02.238
SAID THAT THE ISSUES HAVE BEEN

02:58:02.304 --> 02:58:04.874
LAID ON THE TABLE. IN A VERY

02:58:04.940 --> 02:58:08.144
CLEAR WAY AND FOR ME NOW. GIVEN

02:58:08.210 --> 02:58:09.111
THE CHOICE IT'S LIKE I WILL VOTE

02:58:09.178 --> 02:58:12.114
TO MOVE ALONG AND I THINK SAID.

02:58:12.181 --> 02:58:14.917
THAT IT IS IMPORTANT IN THE

02:58:14.984 --> 02:58:18.187
HEATED DISCUSSION THAT EXISTS.

02:58:18.254 --> 02:58:20.656
TO HONOR. ARE THE CONCERNS THAT

02:58:20.723 --> 02:58:22.792
ARE RAISED AND MAKE SURE THEY

02:58:22.858 --> 02:58:24.260
ARE ADDRESSED AND I THINK YOU

02:58:24.326 --> 02:58:25.961
HAVE DONE A REASONABLE JOB. OF

02:58:26.028 --> 02:58:28.497
ADDRESSING THE SPECIFIC THINGS

02:58:28.564 --> 02:58:30.232
THAT WERE THAT WERE RAISED IN

02:58:30.299 --> 02:58:32.468
THIS SO. I KNOW IT'S DIFFICULT

02:58:32.535 --> 02:58:34.804
TO AND- BUT- I APPRECIATE THE

02:58:34.870 --> 02:58:36.672
OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THIS ENGINE

BY EVERYBODY IN PARTICULAR

LETTING THEIR KIDS GET MAX AND

03:06:07.489 --> 03:06:10.158
THAT IS ONE PIECE OF THIS. BUT

03:06:10.225 --> 03:06:12.828
IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT THAT WE KNOW

03:06:12.895 --> 03:06:17.266
THAT THAT MOST KIDS MANY KIDS IF

THEY'RE THINKING ABOUT DOING

03:06:28.443 --> 03:06:31.547
SOMETHING WE'RE GOING TO TALK TO

03:06:31.613 --> 03:06:32.981
THEIR PARENTS NOT ALL BUT MANY.

03:06:33.048 --> 03:06:35.517
BUT THERE ARE SOME KIDS WHO FOR

03:06:35.584 --> 03:06:36.585
WHATEVER REASON CAN'T TALK TO

03:06:36.652 --> 03:06:38.353
