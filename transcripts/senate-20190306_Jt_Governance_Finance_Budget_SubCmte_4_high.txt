MADAM CHAIR IT IS A PLEASURE TO BE TO WORK WITH YOU AND THANK YOU SO MUCH. THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION TURNS A HUNDRED AND FORTY YEARS OLD THIS YEAR. AND TODAY WE'RE GONNA BE FOCUSING ON SOME VERY SPECIFIC ITEMS RELATED TO THE BOARD. IN MANY WAYS EVEN THOUGH IT'S CELEBRATING ITS HUNDRED AND FORTIETH ANNIVERSARY IT'S ALSO STARTING OVER NOW. NOW THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF ITS RESPONSIBILITIES HAVE BEEN SHIFTED TO THE DEPARTMENT OF TAX AND FEE ADMINISTRATION. IN THE OFFICE OF TAX APPEALS. IN NOVEMBER. VOTERS ELECTED FOR NEW BOARD OF EQUALIZATION MEMBERS WITH A DIVERSE SET OF EXPERIENCES AND BACKGROUNDS. AND ALL HAVE HIT THE GROUND RUNNING. WE HAVE TWO HERE TODAY WE WELCOME BOTH OF THEM TO THE HEARING. THEY HAVE A LOT OF WORK AHEAD. CONTROLLER YE THE OFFICE OF STATEWIDE AUDITS AND EVALUATIONS IN THE STATE PERSONNEL BOARD ISSUED AUDITS IN THE PAST. AND IN RECENT YEARS. HAVE ESTABLISHED FINDINGS THAT CANDIDLY OR SHOCKING AND UNACCEPTABLE FOR ANY STATE AGENCY. THESE AUDITS AND REPORTS REVEALED AN AGENCY WHERE PREVIOUS BOARD MEMBERS ACTIONS HAD COMPROMISE THE BASIC FUNCTIONS OF A TAX ADMINISTRATION AGENCY. THESE FINDINGS RESULTED IN GOVERNOR BROWN THE LEGISLATURE TAKING SWIFT A NEARLY UNPRECEDENTED ACTION BY ENACTING THE TAXPAYER TRANSPARENCY AND FAIRNESS. A B. ONE OH TWO WHICH REDUCE THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION TO ITS CORE CONSTITUTIONAL DUTIES. AND CREATED TO IT NEW AGENCIES TO TAKE ON ITS OTHER TAX ADMINISTRATION COLLECTION AND EDUCATION RULES. THE NEWLY ELECTED BOARD MEMBERS SAY IT IS A NEW DAY. BY THE WAY AGAIN NONE OF THOSE NEW BOARD MEMBERS WERE PRESENT DURING THE SCANDALS. AND THE NEW BOARD MEMBERS SAY THEY NEED TIME TO TURN THE AGENCY AROUND. CRITICS SAY THERE IS NO NEED FOR A POLITICALLY ELECTED BOARD. OR AGENCY. AND THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION SHOULD BE INTO ANOTHER STATE DEPARTMENT. TODAY'S HEARING IS THE FIRST STEP IN A PROCESS TO MAKE SURE THAT EIGHTY ONE OH TWO WAS DELIVERING ON ITS PROMISE. THAT OUR REVENUE AGENCIES ARE FAIR. EFFECTIVE AND ACCESSIBLE TO THE TAXPAYING PUBLIC. THIS SPECIFIC GOAL FOR TODAY. IT IS TO EVALUATE THE BORDER OF EQUALIZATION'S PROGRESS. OVER THSE FIRST ESSENTIALLY NINETY DAYS. TODAY EIGHTY TODAY'S HEARING SHOULD PROVIDE US WITH THE INFORMATION WE NEED ABOUT THE BOARD. ITS STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES AND WHAT PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE INTERNALLY SINCE THE TRANSITION OF THE BOARD AND BUDGET. THE STAFF AND BUDGET. WE AS A COMMITTEE OF GOVERNANCE AND FINANCE A BEGUN TO EVALUATE WHAT THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION FUTURE LOOKS LIKE. AND IF AN INDEPENDENT BOARD IS STILL NECESSARY NOW THAT 95% OF ITS BUDGET AND STAFF HAS BEEN TRANSITION. THEY STARTED APPROXIMATELY TWENTY FOUR MONTHS AGO AT FORTY TWO HUNDRED STAFF. AND NOW THEY HAVE LESS THAN. TWO HUNDRED TODAY WE'RE GONNA HEAR FROM THE STATE CONTROLLER WHO IS WORK FOR AND SERVED ON THE BOARD AS A MEMBER FOR MANY YEARS. AND HAS BEEN A LEADER IN THE REFORM MOVEMENT. WE WILL ALSO HEAR FROM THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION CHAIRWOMAN CHAIRWOMAN CONE WHO BELIEVES THE NEW BOARD NEEDS TIME TO ENACT REFORMS. WHILE ALSO HEAR FROM A PANEL OF INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE EXPERIENCE WITH THE BOARD BOTH BEFORE AND AFTER A B.. ONE OH TWO WE ALSO WANT TO HEAR FROM ALL OF YOU THE PUBLIC. SO WE WOULD WELCOME ANYONE TO COME FORWARD AND SPEAK DURING THAT TIME EACH SPEAKER WILL BE PROVIDED TWO MINUTES TO ADDRESS THE COMMITTEE'S [inaudible] FINALLY [inaudible] THE WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE GOING TO BE SOME HARD DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE BOARDS FUTURE. HAPPENING IN THE CAPITAL THIS YEAR. THE ONLY QUESTION IS THIS. WHETHER WE HAVE THOSE DISCUSSIONS IN PUBLIC. HARINGS LIKE THIS. ONE OR BEHIND CLOSED DOORS. WE BELIEVE IT'S BEST TO HAVE THOSE DISCUSSIONS IN THE LIGHT OF THE PUBLIC. EVEN THOUGH SOME OF THOSE CONVERSATIONS MAY BE DIFFICULT TODAY AND IN THE MONTHS TO COME. WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO BE TO TURN IT OVER TO OUR PARTNER CENTER DRAWS OVER ANY OPENING COMMENTS YOU MAY HAVE AND AGAIN.

FOCUSING ON MAYBE ON LESS GOVERNMENT. BUT ALSO LOOKING AT THE FACT THAT WE WHEN I HAVE ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES THAT WE CAN APPEAL -- TO ON TAX MATTERS. SO I'M LOOKING FORWARD.

FOR THIS GERMAN AND I WANT TO OBSERVE AS WE PROCEED. THIS IS THE KIND OF THING THAT THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD BE DOING. THE TRAILER BILL PROCESS IS VERY INAPPROPRIATE PARTICULARLY FOR REORGANIZING AN AGENCY WITH SUCH A HISTORY IS THIS OF A HUNDRED AND FORTY YEARS. THE TRAILER BILL CONSIDERATION IS CURSORY. IN NO DEPTH. IT IS ACTUALLY A CORRUPTION OF THE BUDGET PROCESS. THAT'S A LONG VOICE COMPLAINT YOU'RE NOT HEARING ANYTHING NEW FOR ME HERE [inaudible] BUT THIS. PROCEEDING AND FUTURE ONES TO COM WILL BE VERY IMPORTANT. AS THE LEGISLATURE DECIDES THE FUTURE PATHWAY IN COURSE THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION FILLED CHERISH THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING US THIS OPPORTUNITY TO NOW DELIBERATE FINE. THANK YOU SO MUCH AS A VICE CHAIR WE'D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO GO OVER THE FORMAT. QUICKLY IN INTERNET OVER THE CONTROLLER. BETTER CONTROLLER WILL BE PROVIDED FIFTEEN MINUTES TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE.

WE WELCOME PUBLIC COMMENT EACH INDIVIDUAL HAVE TWO MINUTES TO BE ABLE TO SAY THEIR PIECE. AGAIN WE ARE GRATEFUL THAT ALL OF YOUR HERE TODAY THANK YOU MADAM CONTROLLER FOR TAKING TIME OUT OF YOUR BUSY SCHEDULE THE FLOOR IS YOURS YOU HAVE FIFTEEN MINUTES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIRMAN GOOD MORNING HAD THE MORNING MADAM CHAIRWOMAN AND SENATORS. AND THANK YOU FOR THE INVITATION TO APPEAR BEFORE YOU TODAY -- I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR HOLDING THIS HEARING AND I WANT TO JUST ECHO -- CENTER NIELSEN'S POINT AND THAT IS THIS IS -- EXACTLY THE CHARGE FOR THAT -- I THINK -- FOR ALL OF YOU IN TERMS OF YOUR WOMAN SAID TO INFORM THE WORK OF THE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE AS WELL -- TO BE ABLE TO HAVE DECENT -- INFORMATIONAL HEARINGS ALSO WHILE THIS MAY BE THE FIRST VIEWING OF THIS MOVIE FOR SOME OF YOU I DO HAVE TO POINT OUT THAT THAT SOMEONE THAT'S BEEN SHOWING ON AND OFF IN SACRAMENTO FOR ALMOST EIGHTY YEARS. OF ALMOST -- JUST AS SOON AS CALIFORNIA ESTABLISHED A STATEWIDE SALES TAX IN PERSONAL INCOME TAX BACK IN. NINETEEN THIRTY THREE AND BEFORE THE END OF THE DECADE THERE ARE ALREADY REPORTS AND STUDIES THAT WERE PREPARED REGARDING SOME TYPE OF TAX AGENCY CONSOLIDATION OF THAT SHOULD TAKE PLACE. AND SINCE THEN THERE HAVE BEEN PROPOSALS LARGE AND SMALL. RANGING FROM CONSOLIDATING TAXPAYER OUTREACH EFFORTS TO LARGER TENDS TO CONSOLIDATE THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION AND EVEN THE EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT INTO A SINGLE ENTITY. AND THAT'S YOUR COMMITTEE BACKGROUND -- PAPER POINTS OUT LOW MORE THAN EIGHTEEN MONTHS AGO THE LEGISLATURE ENACTED ASSEMBLY BILL ONE OH TO CREATING THE OFFICE OF TAX APPEALS OF THE OTA COMMONLY KNOWN. AS THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT TAX AND FEE ADMINISTRATION OR CD TFA. OF THE BILL MOVED EVERYTHING THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION TO HAVE RESPONSIBILITY -- FOR IN STATE STATUTES SO THOSE ABOUT 90% OF ITS OVERALL DUTIES TO THESE TWO NEW AGENCIES. FOR THAT REALITY REALLY LEADS US TO QUESTIONS I BELIEVE. THE FIRST IS GIVEN WHAT THE BOARD IS NOW -- SHOULD CONTINUE TO BE AN ELECTED BOARD. AND IF THE ANSWER TO THAT IS NO THEN THE SECOND QUESTION IS WHAT IS THE BEST MOST TAXPAYER FRIENDLY AND RESPONSIVE WAY. THE MINISTER THE PROGRAMS THAT TODAY REMAIN UNDER THE BOARD'S UMBRELLA. FOR ME THE ANSWER THE FIRST QUESTION IS NO. THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION DOES NOT NEED NOR SHOULD CONTINUE TO HAVE AN ELECTED BOARD AND I SAY THIS WITH PHONE. YOU'RE REALLY SOME -- SADNESS BECAUSE I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO SERVE ON THE BOARD AND I'M STILL CURRENTLY ON THE FIFTH VOTING MEMBER OF THE BOARD -- BUT THE BOARD HAS CHANGED OVER TIME AND CERTAINLY NOW WITH THIS -- LIMITED RESPONSIBILITIES OR REDUCE RESPONSIBILITIES I DO BELIEVE THERE IS NO NEED FOR AN ELECTED BOARD. AND SO THE SECOND QUESTION IS AND WHAT IS THE BEST MOST -- TAXPAYER RESPONSIVE AND FRIENDLY WAY TO ADMINISTER THE PROGRAMS THAT REMAIN TODAY UNDER THE BOARD'S UMBRELLA. THE FORTY NINE OTHER STATES MANAGE QUITE WELL WITHOUT ELECTED BOARDS AND I'M CONFIDENT THE CALIFORNIA CAN DO THE SAME. OF THE ANSWER TO THE SECOND QUESTION -- DOESN'T HAVE AN OBVIOUS ANSWER AND I THINK THAT'S FOR US TO SORT AS WE CONTINUE THESE CONVERSATIONS -- WHICH MEANS THAT SO THERE'S REALLY NOT A WRONG WAY TO DO IT -- WHAT I WILL SAY IS THAT THERE IS AN EXPERT IS A COMING UPON THE DUTIES THAT THE BORDER IS A UTILIZATION STILL? HAS AND I WANT JUST A TECHNOLOGY EXPERTISE AMONG THE STAFF WHO REALLY ARE THE OF THE LIAISON WITH OUR OUR TAX PAYING COMMUNITY PARTICULARLY OUR OUR STATUS AS SEASON. AND I AM SURE THAT THE ASSESSORS AND AND THE OF WHAT VEHICLE SECTION REPRESENTS WILL BECOME ANYMORE ABOUT THAT. AND UP SO BY THAT I MEAN A CREDIBLE CASE TO BE MADE TO LEAVE THE B. ALWAYS PROGRAMS RIGHT WHERE THEY ARE JUST ELIMINATE THE ELECTED BOARD IN THE CONSTITUTION. OR YOU CAN MOVE ALL THE PROGRAMS TO SAY THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD OR YOU CAN MOVE THE MALL TO THE CITY TODAY -- OR YOU COULD SPLIT THE PROGRAMS BETWEEN AGENCIES BECAUSE THERE ARE SOME PROPERTY TAX PROGRAMS THAT HAVE SPECIFIC POLICY OF FOCUS. OF THE NAME ON THE DOOR OF WHO ADMINISTERS HIS PROGRAMS IS LESS IMPORTANT THAN HOW THEIR MINISTER NOTHING CENTER MORE LOCK YOUR POINT IS EXACTLY WHAT WE SHOULD BE FOCUSED ON AND THAT IS YOU KNOW WHAT SHOULD. BE THE EXPECTATION OF THE TAXPAYERS IN TERMS OF HOW THEY WILL BE SERVED AND IS THE ONE WHERE WE KNOW WILL BE RESPONSIVE AND CERTAINLY ACCESSIBLE. FOR TAXPAYERS. SO WHAT'S IMPORTANT THESE PROGRAMS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. ARE THERE ARE A NUMBER OF THEM AND FIRST I JUST WANNA START OUT WITH THE PROPERTY TAX ADVOCATE -- GENERALLY THERE IN EACH TAX AGENCY THERE IS A TAXPAYER RIGHTS ADVOCATES OFFICE -- BUT IN THE END THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION SUPPORT -- PROPERTY TAX ADVOCATE THAT WAS -- REQUIRED A PERSON TO THE MORGAN PROPERTY TAX PAYERS BILL OF RIGHTS IN STATUTE. THEN THERE IS THE STATUS AS PROPERTY PROGRAM WHICH ENTAILS ESTIMATING -- MARKET VALUE AND ASSESSING ANNUALLY INTERCOUNTY PIPELINES EXCLUSIVE OF OF LAND AND RIGHTS OF WAY. AT ALL THE TAXABLE PROPERTIES OWNED AND USED BY REAL ROADS AND CERTAIN PUBLIC UTILITIES. THERE IS THE COUNTY ASSESSOR PROPERTY PROGRAM OF THE OVERSIGHT FUNCTIONS OF THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION PROVIDES OVER THE COUNTY ASSESSOR -- PROPERTY PROGRAM AND THERE IS A WHOLE LIST OF OF FUNCTIONS OF IN TERMS OF THE OVERSIGHT RESPONSIBILITY OF BOARD OF EQUALIZATION I'M SURE YOU'LL HEAR FROM. THE ASSESSORS ABOUT BUT CERTAINLY IN TERMS OF HAVING A TEAM GOING UNTIL SEE HOW WELL OUR COUNTY ASSESSORS ARE DOING WITH RESPECT TO THEIR ASSESSMENT PRACTICES. A AND PROBABLY MOST IMPORTANTLY THE ISSUES OF ISSUANCE OF GUIDANCE TO BE SURE THAT WE CAN -- ACHIEVE SOME UNIFORMITY ACROSS COUNTIES -- WITH RESPECT TO THE PROPERTY TAX ASSESSMENT ISSUES. OF FINALLY THERE'S A CENTRALIZED WEBSITE FIRST A LOCAL STATUS OF PROPERTY TAX LAW RULES LEGAL OPINIONS. OF FORMS INSTRUCTIONS FAQ'S AND MORE AND WHAT I WOULD SAY TO THAT IS THAT THAT COULD REALLY BE HOUSE AND EVEN BE MORE CENTRALIZED AT THE STATE LEVEL SO THAT WE CAN ESTABLISH A ONE STOP SHOP FOR ALL. OUR TAX MATTERS. BUT WHAT I WANT TO JUST RECOGNIZES THAT HAVING AN ELECTED BOARD -- YES WE HAVE -- FOR ELECTED BY DISTRICTS WHO ARE TAXPAYER ADVOCATES -- CERTAINLY REPRESENTING FOR THE POSITION. BUT ALL OF US IN THIS ROOM WHO ARE AFFECTED OUR TAXPAYER ADOCATES. AND I KNOW I KNOW WE SURE THE GOAL OF ENSURING THAT THESE PROGRAMS ARE ADMINISTERED EFFICIENTLY AND CLEARLY FOR ALL TAXPAYERS. AND I'M SURE CERTAINLY HAPPY TO BE HELPFUL TO US TOO BIG OF A CONTINUED DELIBERATIONS ABOUT -- SHOULD YOU DECIDE THAT THE ELECTED JERRY OF THE BEST HOME FOR THESE PROGRAMS THAT I JUST MENTIONED. AND LET ME JUST MAKE A COUPLE OF OTHER REMARKS WITH RESPECT TO OF pRESPONSIBILITIES WE HAVE -- AS I SAID A LEVEL OF EXPERTISE THAT THE STAFF -- PROCESSES THAT CAN BE MOVED REALLY ANYWHERE IN STATE GOVERNMENT. AND THESE ARE THE RELATIONSHIPS THAT. ARE BETWEEN THE OF THE ASSESSMENT TEAM AT THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION WITH OUR COUNTY ASSESSOR'S WITH OUR STATE SSE -- ENTITIES OF THOSE RELATIONSHIPS WILL NOT CHANGE HIGH ANTICIPATE THAT IF WE NO LONGER WANT AN ELECTED BOARD THOSE RELATIONSHIPS WILL REMAIN INTACT. EITHER AS THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION WITHOUT AN ELECTED BOARD OR AS A SEPARATE LEE FUNCTIONING -- DIVISION AND ANOTHER AGENCY. WE ALSO -- ALSO JUST WANTED BOARD. AND I'VE BEEN AN ADVOCATE OF THIS FOR A LONG TIME FOR EACH OF THE TAX AGENCY'S WHETHER WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD CD TWO FAA. OR THE EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT OF THERE IS ALWAYS ROOM TO ENHANCE THE TAXPAYER ADVOCATES RESPONSIBILITIES. OF THERE ARE IS IS A POINT OF CONTACT FOR MANY TAXPAYERS WHEN THEY ARE FRUSTRATED ABOUT HOW TO NAVIGATE OF THE TAX AGENCY'S. OF BUT IT IS ALSO A PLACE WHERE THEY CAN GET TO A REALLY PERSONAL ATTENTION TO THEIR ISSUES -- IN TERMS OF HOW TO NAVIGATE TO RESOLUTIONS WITH ANY STATE TAX ENTITY. SO -- I WOULD SAY AGAIN THERE IS NO OBVIOUS RIGHT OR WRONG DIRECTION IN TERMS OF WHERE THESE FUNCTIONS SHOULD GO. BUT AT THE SAME TIME. WE WANT TO BE SURE THAT THE TAXPAYERS ARE WELL SERVED AND AS I DID SUPPORT THE EIGHTY ONE OF TWO THE BIGGEST STUFF -- AREA OF FOCUS THAT I HAD IN TERMS OF THE RESPONSIBILITIES THAT ARE NOW HOUSES SEATED HALF A AND WITH -- TA IS TO BE SURE THAT THE EXPECTATIONS WERE CLEAR IN TERMS OF BOTH OF THOSE AGENCIES TO TAXPAYERS. THAT THE OUT REACH IS A ROBUST IN TERMS OF HEALTH OF THE IS -- WELL STAFFED AND OPEN FOR BUSINESS ANY TIME OF DAY. SO -- WITH THAT OF I THINK IT WILL STOP THERE AND ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT THE NUMBERS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU MADAM CHILLER NEIGHBORS WE LIKE TO BE ABLE TO OPEN IT UP FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE CONTROLLER SENATOR BELL. GLAD THE THE CONTROLLERS HERE AND SOMETHING'S BEEN. STICKING IN MY CRAW. FOR ABOUT A YEAR AND ASKED HER ABOUT IT. OF THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION -- WAS RESPONSIBLE [inaudible] FOR A REVENUE NEUTRAL. EVALUATION OF THE SALES TAX ON GASOLINE AND CONVERTING IT TO A REGULAR GAS TAX. THEIR JOB UNDER THE STATUTE. WAS NOT TO MAKE A DECISION WHETHER OR NOT THAT TAX IS APPROPRIATE. BUT TO SIMPLY FIGURE OUT OF WHAT THE REVENUE NEUTRAL LEVEL OF A GASOLINE TAX WOULD BE. THAT WAS THEIR RESPONSIBILITY -- FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AS DICTATED BY THE LEGISLATION -- HOWEVER LAST YEAR THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION DECIDED -- TO REJECT THE GAS TAX INCREASE. IN OTHER WORDS -- NOT HAVE A REVENUE NEUTRAL -- PROCESS BUT TO REJECT THIS I BELIEVE THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION -- AND ALSO -- THE CALCULATIONS. AND DECIDE NOT TO INCREASE THE GAS TAX COMMENSURATE WITH THE WHAT THE SALES TAX WOULD HAVE BEEN AS RESPONSIBLE BY THE LEGISLATION. SO MY QUESTION TO YOU IS -- COULD YOU TELL. WHY THEY DID THAT AND -- ALSO WHAT THE REVENUE LOSS TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WAS -- AND MAYBE YOU CAN JUST GIVE US ON I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW DIRECTLY BUT WHAT THE ORDER OF MAGNITUDE OF REVENUE LOSS RIGHT WAS SO -- I I FELT THAT WE PASSED A LAW. WE WE PASS A LAW THAT GAVE THEM THE RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKING THAT ADJUSTMENT. AND THEN THEY JUST DECIDED TO IGNORE WHAT WE PUT ON OUR STATUTE. SO CAN YOU CAN YOU OR MAYBE COMMENT ON THAT SURE THANK YOU SENT A BILL FOR THE QUESTIONS -- AND I HAPPEN TO AGREE WITH YOU OF THE BOARD'S RESPONSIBILITY WAS REALLY EVERY YEAR TO DO THOSE SO CALLED TRUE UP. AN ODD TO BE SURE THAT OF THE ALL THE SPIRIT OF THE STATUTE WAS CARRIED OUT. ON NOT TO LEGISLATE THE OF THE DEGREE OF THE DEATH GOT SACKS INCREASE AND AND I WAS A NO VOTE I SUPPORT THE STAFF HAS PETITIONED FUNDS LOST SO WE'RE IN THE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. AND WE CAN ILL AFFORD TO HEAR REALLY LOSE OF THOSE DOLLARS -- FROM TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS -- BUT IT WAS -- AT AND I CAN'T SPEAK FOR THE PRIOR BOARD WHO VOTED ON THE SUN TERMS OF WHAT THE MOTIVATION WAS BUT I'M SURE GIVEN THE ROBUSTNESS OF THE CONVERSATION -- THAT DID TAKE PLACE -- THINK THERE WERE THERE WAS A FEELING THAT THERE WAS SOME EXPOSURES THAT -- WE WERE INCREASING GAS TAXES WHEN IN FACT IT WAS A MECHANISM THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAD A ACTIVE THAT -- REALLY JUST PLACED IN OUR HANDS THE AS YOU SAY OF THE INSURING THE REVENUE NEUTRALITY AND THE TRIP THAT WE WOMAN I WOULD LIKE TO FIND OUT EXACTLY HOW MUCH REVENUE. WAS LOST TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE CAN WE CAN GET BY THIS INAPPROPRIATE ACTION OF THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION. AND IF IT IS ON THE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF COURSE I DON'T BELIEVE WE CAN RECOVER THAT AT ALL. THERE'S NO WAY IT'S JUST. LOST -- REVENUE AND THEN WHAT THE IMPACT OF THAT REVENUE LOSS WAS BECAUSE THOSE FUNDS WERE FOR ROAD REPAIRS -- AND THE MONEY WOULD GO TO ROAD REPAIRS -- THERE WERE ABOUT AND WE'RE WE HAD THIS HUGE ROW REPAIR BACKLOG. AND THAT'S WHY WE PAST SP. ONE AND I THINK THAT -- THIS IS. AN EXAMPLE OF A PROBLEM WITH THE BORDER LEGALIZATION -- BUT I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THE RESEARCH DONE ON WHAT THE REVENUE LOSS WOULD BE A SORT OF BILL WHAT I WILL DO. LET ME GET YOU THE EXACT MAGNITUDE OF THE DOLLAR LOSS I THINK WITH RESPECT TO THE IMPACT ON OUR PROJECTS OF THE CALIFORNIANS PETITION COMMISSION AND OTHERS MIGHT BE. BETTER INFORMED ON THAT THAT WE CAN COORDINATE WITH THEM AS WELL. OF AND WHAT WHAT I WOULD JUST SAY THAT YOU KNOW THE ROLE OF THE BOARD IS REALLY TO APPLY THE LAW. TO APPLY THE LAW OF WE'RE NOT LEGISLATORS WE IMPLEMENTED A A WHAT ALL OF YOU AN ACT AND WERE THERE TO APPLY THE LAW AND I THINK -- FROM MY PERSPECTIVE MY NOBLE INDICATED THAT IT WAS AN OVER REACH. BE INTERESTING TO SEE HOW MUCH -- ROAD REPAIRS. AND SAFETY PROJECTS WERE SET BACK. DO THAT LOST REVENUE AND I THINK THE THE CONSEQUENCE OF IT IS. WAS VERY BIG IN TERMS OF THE ROAD REPAIRS THAT WERE NOT ABLE TO DO SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH A CHARMING DRAWS ON I WILL WORK WITH THE CONTROLLER IN HER OFFICE TO BE ABLE TO DISTRIBUTE INFORMATION. EQUALLY TO ALL MEMBERS A TERM DRAWS A OF CONTROLLER YE. OF YOU MENTION. MANY OF THE IN YOUR OPINION MANY OF THE RESPONSIBILITIES COULD BE MOVED ELSEWHERE. IN STATE GOVERNMENT. OF COULD YOU DIG IN. A LITTLE BIT DEEPER INTO THAT AND WHAT YOU MEAN BY THAT THAT'S ONE QUESTION [inaudible] OF HOW DOES THE NEW STRUCTURE. IMPROVE OVERSIGHT OF AND ACCOUNTABILITY. OF THE FUNCTIONS OF THE TWO NEW DEPARTMENTS. OF AND THE THIRD IS YOU HAVE AN OPINION ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THIS BOARD THE BILL WE SHOULD BE AN ELECTED. POSITION -- CAN YOU EXPLAIN WHY YOU THINK OR A WE'RE BETTER OFF WITH IT NOT BEING AN ELECTED POSITION SURE SURE -- LET ME SEE THIS MAYBE START WITH THE LAST QUESTION FIRST -- CALIFORNIA REMAINS THE ONLY STATE -- ALL OTHER FORTY NINE STATES ARE ABLE -- TO REALLY CARRY OUT THESE DUTIES -- ADMINISTRATIVELY. OF THEIR VERY VERY STRUCTURES FOR HOW THESE PROGRAMS ARE A MISTER WITHIN THE OTHER FORTY NINE STATES WHAT I'M SUGGESTING HERE IF A MANAGER WOMAN IS OUT OF CALIFORNIA CAN FOLLOW SUIT. OBVIOUSLY THE EXPERTISE LIES WITH THE STUFF ANDWE CAN REALLY HOW'S THE STUFF ANYWHERE COULD BE IS EVEN A NEW STANDALONE. OF SMALL DEPARTMENT IF YOU WANTED IT THAT WAY NO NEED FOR AN ELECTED BOARD HIM BUT IT OVER-MY TIME OF SERVING ON THE BOARD. OF CERTAINLY HAD A FULL WORKLOAD WHEN I SERVED ON THE BOARD WE HAVE THE THE APPELLATE FUNCTIONS. WE WERE A FULL TIME WORKING BOARD. OF AND EVEN OVER STARTING -- TO DIMINISHED A BIT MANY MORE CASES WERE GOING TO SETTLEMENTS AND AND TODAY OBVIOUSLY THERE IS NO PUBLIC FUNCTIONS ON OTHER THAN OUR PROPERTY TAX APPEALS FOR STATUS AS THESE BEFORE THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION. SO I THINK THOSE OF FUNCTIONS CAN BE HOUSE ELSEWHERE THE GUIDANCE ASSESSORS AND YOU'LL HEAR FROM SOME THE ASSESSORS TODAY IS IMPORTANT. BECAUSE THE ORIGINAL OF FUNK -- PURPOSE OF THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION ESTABLISHING THE CONSTITUTION WAS INSURE UNIFORMITY ACROSS COUNTY LINES IN TERMS OF OF PROPERTY TAXATION ASSESSMENTS. AND WHAT I BEGAN TO SEE OF IS REALLY OF REALLY MOVING AWAY FROM THAT UNIFORMITY THAT -- IN TERMS OF HOW TESTERS WERE BEING SERVED AND SOME GETTING THE SOME THESE PROGRAMS -- ON THE GROUND FOR TAXPAYERS IN OTHER DISTRICTS THAT WERE MORE ROBUST AND DOING SO SO I THINK HAVING. EVERYTHING UNDER A SINGLE UMBRELLA A SINGLE ADMINISTRATION JUST ENSURE THAT ALL TAXPAYERS HAVE ACCESS TO SIMILAR RESOURCES CAN BE SERVED EQUALLY. AND CERTAINLY WITH RESPECT TO PROPERTY TAX ON THE GUIDANCE -- TO ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES THAT IS PART OF THE OVERSIGHT RESPONSIBILITY OF THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION FOR COUNTY ASSESS PROPERTIES. IS A REALLY IMPORTANT -- AND THAT GUIDES REALLY CAN COME FROM THE EXPERTS HOUSE ANYWHERE IN STATE GOVERNMENT. SO I THINK IT'S REALLY ABOUT THE FUNCTIONS IT'S ABOUT -- HOW WE BEST SERVE TAXPAYERS OF I KNOW THE ELECTED MEMBERS BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE CONDUITS FOR THEIR CONSTITUENTS TO COME? AND I HAVE THEIR ISSUES -- RESULTS OF FRANKLY IF WE HAVE A HUNDRED TWENTY LEGISLATORS THAT ALSO CAN BE CONDUITS FOR THAT. AND IT'S JUST TO ME -- BUT ADDED IT'S USEFUL PURPOSE ANYMORE. COULD YOU TELL IN SUCH A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME SINCE THE CHANGES WERE MADE US WITH THE DIFFERENCES ARE. YEAH I KNOW IT'S A VERY SHORT IT IS A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME AND I DON'T WANT TO BE UNFAIR WITH RESPECT TO THE ASSESSMENT LOOK ANY REORGANIZATION OF THIS MAGNITUDE IS GOING TO TAKE TIME. AND SURE THERE BEEN ROCKY STARTS AND AND BUT I DO THINK THAT BOTH THE DEPARTMENT STILL CD TFA AND NO T. A. AND AND A MENTOR WILL YOU WILL HAVE A LOTS OF OPPORTUNITIES -- TO A REALLY DO A DEEP DIVE ON THIS -- DURING YOUR SUBCOMMITTEE PROCESS BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT -- YOU KNOW ITS -- SETTLING IN OKAY AS NOW HEARING REGULAR CASELOADS AND THEY'LL PROBABLY RAMP UP AS CASES OR WE HAVE JUST BEEN AMORE CASES ARE BEING PREPARED OF FOR A HEARING -- TA ACIDITY FAA OF I THINK IT WAS -- TOUGH FOR THESE -- STUFF -- TO LOOK AT BEGINNING -- IN A NEW ORGANIZATION THAT -- DIDN'T HAVE ELECTED DIDN'T HAVE AN ELECTED BOARD. OF AND I THINK PART OF THAT WAS BECAUSE WE DON'T WE THEY JUST FELT LIKE THAT LISTEN. I DON'T WANT TO EVEN GET INTO THAT IN TERMS OF WHAT HAPPENED IN THE PAST BONES A LOT OF THAT'S BEEN DOCUMENTED AND REPORTS AND AND ON A SORT OF BEEN DONE. BUT BUT I THINK THE NEW DEPARTMENT CERTAINLY SELLING AND I THINK THAT AS YOU BEGIN TO LOOK AT THE VARIOUS -- TAX AND FEE PROGRAMS ARE BEING ADMINISTERED BY THE NEW DEPARTMENT OF THEY ARE ALL WELL STUFF THEY ARE BEING RESPONSIVE -- THE OUT REACHES US STARTING TO BECOME MORE ROBUST AND SO IT JUST TAKES TIME. OF IT'S DIFFICULT TO MOVE ON IT JUST THOUSANDS OF EMPLOYEES ACROSS SOME -- DEPARTMENTS AT ORGANIZATIONS AND STATE GOVERNMENT AND HOPE THAT IT BEGINS TO DO ITS JOB OVERNIGHT -- BUT I EASE OF STAND BY LIFE SUPPORT OF A B. ONE OH TWO LAST YEAR AND AND CENTER NIELSEN. OF I JUST WANNA MAKE A COMMENT ABOUT THE BUDGET TRAILER BILL PROCESS -- POINT WELL TAKEN TERMS OF A MAJOR MAJOR POLICY INITIATIVE AND CERTAINLY REORGANIZATION -- TAKING PLACE IN A BUDGET TRAILER BILL I WILL SAY THOUGH THAT -- SET ITSELF FOR A LEADING UP TO THAT TRAILER BILL. FOR MANY MANY YEARS UP TO THAT POINT HAD REALLY BEGUN -- TO YOU KNOW REALLY DIG DEEP IN TERMS OF SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT. GAVE RISE TO A BE ONE OR TWO AND SO I DID AND THE AND A LOT OF OVERSIGHT THAT HAD BEEN DONE LEADING UP TO THAT POINT AND I AND FRANKLY I WOULD HAVE SUPPORTED THE BILL OF I DON'T THINK THAT -- THAT WAS ALREADY KNOWN. OF THAT -- THAT I THINK THIS IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO TAKE TIME AND WILL CONTINUE TO IMPROVE. US SENATOR ALSO WHEN YOU HAVE YOUR OVERSIGHT HEARINGS I THINK BOTH DEPARTMENTS WILL. BE VERY FAIR AND ABOUT THEIR SUSSMAN ABOUT WHERE THEY ARE TODAY -- BUT ALSO ARE VERY VERY -- EAGER TO THE KITCHEN TO DO BETTER. WHAT IS YOUR YOUR RELATIONSHIP NOW WITH THE TWO NEW DEPARTMENTS -- WHAT WHAT IS THE CONNECTION OR RELATIONSHIP AND YES HAS THAT BEEN REALLY FIGURE IT OUT? OR IS THAT CHANGING WHAT. OF TWO NEW DEPARTMENTS AS OF NONE. OF THESE ARE EXACTLY BRANCH OF AGENCIES SO THAT OUR DEPARTMENT OF TAX AND FEE ADMINISTRATION. AS AN EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND EXECUTIVE TEAM OF LIKE ANY OTHER -- STATE AGENCY OF THE OFFICE FOR TACK OF TAX APPEALS SO SAME THING THERE IS A AN EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR. A DIRECTOR OF THAT DEPARTMENT AS WELL AND WITH ANY APPELLATE ORGANIZATIONS OF I THINK IT'S WISE NOT TO HAVE ANY RELATIONSHIP WITH THEM. AS THEY DO TO REMAIN INDEPENDENT SO OF MY OF OF THE ONLY ROLE I HAVE NOW IS A A SERVING AS THE FIFTH VOTING MEMBER OF THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. WE'RE GONNA CENTER GOT JOHNNY. THANK YOU I HAVE SOME COMMENTS THAT I'D LIKE TO MAKE AND THEN I'D LIKE TO ASK YOU A QUESTION BUT FIRST OF ALL I REALLY THINK THAT. THIS YEAR IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO RETHINK AND RE PURPOSE AND MODERNIZE THE ROLE OF THE BOARD OF THE LETTERS OF THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION. I'M SERVING IN MY THIRTEENTH YEAR AND THE LEGISLATURE IN ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I'VE ALWAYS STRUGGLED WITH HIS THAT. CALIFORNIANS HAVE PASSED MORE THAN SEVENTY BILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF BEHIND MEASURES AND THE TIME THAT I'VE BEEN HERE. ABOUT A HUNDRED AND THIRTY EIGHT BILLION IN LOCAL SCHOOL MY MEASURES BUT YET THERE'S LITTLE ACCOUNTABILITY AND IT SEEMS THAT IN THE LEGISLATURE WE WILL LOOK AT SOMETHING WHEN THERE'S A PROBLEM. AND THEN WE ARE OFF TO THE NEXT CRISIS OR A CRITICAL THING THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS TO DEAL WITH. AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THERE'S A REAL OPPORTUNITY HERE FOR THE LEGISLATURE. TO DESIGNATE SOME SPECIFIC STATION TO COMPLEMENT WHAT WE DO IN THE LEGISLATURE AND ASSIST US WITH THE BOND ACCOUNTABILITY AND OVERSIGHT. AND PARTICULARLY -- TO GIVE THE PUBLIC AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE PRESENT AT PUBLIC HEARINGS THAT THEY HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING THAT WE AS A BODY AND THE THE STATE ELECTED. AS A WHOLE ARE REALLY TAKING SERIOUSLY OUR JOB AS BEING GOOD CUSTODIANS OF TAXPAYER DOLLARS AND IN THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS WE HAVE PASSED -- NUMBER OF WATER BEHIND MEASURES THERE ARE ELEVEN DIFFERENT WATER FINANCING COMMITTEES THAT ARE STILL IN PLACE YEAH AND I BELIEVE THAT THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO REPURPOSE SOME OF THE REMAINING FRIENDS. THAT ARE SITTING IN SOME OF THOSE COMMITTEES THAT HAVE BEEN IN USE THIS YEAR THE LEGISLATURE IS THINKING ABOUT IMPOSING A WATER TAXI FOR SAFE. AND CLEAN DRINKING WATER PARTICULARLY IN SOME OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY COUNTIES -- BUT YET I BELIEVE THAT THERE IS STILL REMAINING MONEY THAT WE CAN RE PURPOSE BUT WE DON'T KNOW. THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO ASK THE BOARD TO LOOK AT SOME OF THOSE PARTS OF MONIES DO IT PUBLICLY REPORT BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE. AND I'M DOING A BILL ON TO THAT END TO INCLUDE THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE CAN LOOK AT FOR RE MODERNIZING THE PURPOSE OF THE B. ELLIE. AND I'M HOPING THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE CAN LOOK AT TOGETHER AND THAT WE CAN DISCUSS AND I KNOW YOU HAVE A LOT OF EXPERIENCE WITH -- OVER SIDE OF THE BOND MEASURES AS WELL AND AND PERHAPS WE CAN ENTERTAIN THAT IDEA WHILE WE WHILE WE CONSIDER. GETTING RID OF THE B. O. E. ALL TOGETHER I AND REPURPOSE IT TO HAVE IT ASSISTING COMPLEMENT THE LEGISLATURE IN THIS AREA. IS THAT A YES THANK YOU SENATOR JOHNNY AND I I THINK A POINT WELL TAKEN WITH RESPECT. TO LOOKING AT HOW WE DO MODERNIZE SOME OF THESE -- OVERSIGHT FUNCTIONS THAT WE HAVE. FOUR OF REFLECTIVE OF WHAT'S HAPPENING TODAY -- I THINK YOU'LL HEAR FROM SOME THE ASSESSORS THAT -- WITH RESPECT TO PROPERTY TAX ASSESSMENTS AND OVERSIGHT RESPONSIBILITIES BY THE BOARD AND CERTAINLY -- OUR ROLE WAS STATUS AS PROPERTIES THAT -- A LOT HAS CHANGED IN TERMS OF THE LANDSCAPE SINCE PROP THIRTEEN BUT I'LL LEAVE THAT TO THE ASSESSORS. OF WHAT I WILL SAY WITH RESPECT -- TO JUST A BOND OVERSIGHT -- OVERSEE THOSE OF LITTLE BIT OF AN ELEPHANT WITH THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION SURCHARGE IS REALLY WITH PROPERTY TAX ASSESSMENTS. I HAPPEN TO SERVE ON A NUMBER OF THOSE BOND OVERSIGHT COMMITTEES I WOULD BE HAPPY. TO REALLY LOOK AT HOW WE ACTIVATE THOSE SOONER RATHER THAN LATER. OF THAT SO I HOPE I MEAN LOOK I'M I'M IN THE ACOUNTABILITY BUSINESS IN MY DAY JOB WITH MY GREEN EYE SHADE DUTIES AND THAT WHAT I LIKE TO SEE IS THAT EVERY DECISION THAT YOU MAKE WITH RESPECT TO HOW YOU ALLOCTE BOND PROCEEDS. ARE GOING TO ENTITIES THAT HAVE STRONG INTERNAL CONTROLS AND AND SO MAYBE SOME OF THE THE EARLY WORK OF THOSE FINANCING OVERSIGHT COMMITTEES ABOUT FOR BONDS COULD BE LOOKING AT EXACTLY AT THOSE TYPES OF QUESTIONS SO. I THINK THERE IS ROOM TO LOOK AT MODERNIZING THE FUNCTIONS OF THOSE OVERSIGHT OF BODIES OF BUT IT IS A LITTLE BIT WITH RESPECT TO THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION CITIES I WILL ALSO SAY I WANTED JUST A COMMENT THAT MY COLLEAGUE OUR STATE TREASURER OF FIELD AMALA. REALLY HAS THE OVERSIGHT WITH RESPECT -- TO NO BON BON OVERSIGHT AND BOTH THE STATE AND LOCAL ON MEASURES AS THAT ISSUE ISSUANCES HAPPEN OUT OF THAT OFFICE. SENATOR JOHN DID YOU WANNA ASK ANY QUESTIONS OR ANY TO SHOW COMMENTS NO NOT AT THIS TIME OKAY THINK SO MUCH SOONER. LIKE TO SEE IF WE HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS I HAVE A FEW WANTED TO OPEN IT UP SEE IF WE HAVE ANYONE ELSE WITH QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE [inaudible] ALL RIGHT. CONTROLLER I JUST SAID A FEW OTHER QUESTIONS AND AGAIN THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME TO BE TO BE HERE TODAY. I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS AN INDEPENDENT COMMISSION THAT SETS. THE PAY OF THE LEGISLATURE'S WAS CONSTITUTIONAL [inaudible] OFFICERS. WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO GET YOUR TAKE ON THE BOARD MEMBER COMPENSATION. AS WE'VE SEEN SIGNIFICANT TRANSITION. OF BUDGET OVERSIGHT. AS WELL AS POLICY RESPONSIBILITIES SHIFTED TO OTHER AGENCIES. IS THAT AN APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF PAY AT ONE FIFTY ONE TO SIXTY THE OTHER QUESTION THAT I HAVE FOR YOU TWO PARTER. NOW THAT THERE IS. A SHIFT THE RESPONSIBILITY. DESCRIBE WHAT THE DAY TO DAY WAR WORK LOOKS LIKE FOR BOARD MEMBER -- AND WHAT ARE THEY DOING THROUGHOUT THE DAY. PLEASE OF THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN OF LET ME ANSWER YOUR FIRST QUESTION FIRST A LITTLE BIT OF AN AWKWARD QUESTION BUT LET ME TRY TO PHRASE IT THIS WAY OF MANY OF YOU KNOW I'M A LIFELONG GIANTS FANS. SO I MEAN OF I KNOW. SO SOME DAYS I SEE A SO SOMETIMES I'M SEE MADISON BUMGARNER KITCHEN I THINK HE IS VASTLY UNDERPAID OF SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. AND OTHER DAYS I DON'T THINK HE'S WORTH THE MAJOR LEAGUE MINIMUM SALARIES SO CLEARLY I'M NOT IN THE CELL RESETTING BUSINESS. OKAY -- BUT I I'M I'M GONNA LEAVE THE POSITION COMMIT COMMISSION WITH COMMISSION WILL LOOK AT AS REALLY OF THE DUTIES OF THE OF THE BOARD AS THEY DO WITH OUR WITH LEGISLATORS AND CERTAINLY WITH OTHER CONSTITUTIONAL OFFICES AS WELL. AND I THINK IT'S CRITICAL THAT WE ALL FOCUS FIRST ON THE REMAINING PROGRAMS OF THE BE A WE STAFF THE MINISTER ON A DAY IN AND DAY OUT BASIS AND AND I THINK THAT REALLY HAS TO BE KIND OF THE CRUX OF WHAT WE DECIDE. ON BECAUSE IT IS ABOUT THE PROGRAMS -- AND THEN OF ONLY THEN CAN THE CONVERSATION BEGAN ABOUT WHERE THEY SHOULD BE HOUSE -- WHAT ON GOING RESPONSIBILITY OF ELECTED MEMBERS MAY HAVE -- ENDS AS I SAID -- TO THE MAIN FOCUS HERE SHOULD BE OUR TAXPAYERS A WHALER WHERE WILL THEY BE BEST SERVED A WITH RESPECT TO THE PROGRAM SO ALL LEAVE THE SALLY SAID INTO THE ASSISTANCE COMPENSATION COMMISSION -- I'M ALSO GONNA BLEED VALVE FOR THE MEMBERS OF THE BOARD WHO ARE HERE OF THE CHAIRWOMAN AND AND A OF THE TO COME IN ABOUT WHAT THE DAY TO DAY ACTIVITIES ARE OF A BOARD MEMBER HI IT'S SO RADICALLY DIFFERENT THAN WHEN I SERVED ON THE BOARD. OF AS I SAID -- ONE NIGHT DURING MY TENURE ON THE BOARD IT WAS A FULL TIME. OF POSITION THAT -- REQUIRED JOBS IT JUST REALLY UNDERSTANDING THE CASES THAT CAME BEFORE THE BOARD WITH A FULL CASELOAD -- AND WITH THE APPELLATE FUNCTION LEGALIZATION ON IT'S A FRANCHISE AN INCOME TAX MATTERS AND BUSINESS TAX MATTERS -- I I COULDN'T COMMENT ABOUT WHAT THE DAY TO DAY -- LIFE OF A BOARD MEMBER LOOKS LIKE TODAY -- ONLY TO SAY THAT THEY ARE NOT WITHOUT THOSE DUTIES AT THIS POINT. WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO SHIFT TO TALK ABOUT ADVOCACY ON BEHALF OF TAXPAYERS. YOU COVERED THAT A BIT BUT I LIKE TO BE TO DO A DEEPER DIVE -- THERE ARE SOME THAT SAY THAT TAXPAYERS ARE GOING TO BE AT RISK. IF IT IS WITHIN AND A HALF. THE REMAINING FORTY CALL ISOLATION RESPONSIBILITIES ARE SHIFTED. TO A TO BEING NAMED AGENCY END OR AN INDEPENDENT -- ACTED BOARD WERE TO BE DISSOLVED IN THE B. O. E. IS A STANDALONE DEPARTMENT. AND I BELIEVE AND I DON'T WANT TO SPEAK FOR THEM BUT BOARD MEMBERS ARE. THEY BELIEVE THE VOICE OF TAXPAYERS. WHEN IT COMES TO THE DUTIES OF -- OF THE DAY IN OF THE BOARD. DEEP DIVE FOR US ON HOW WE ENSURE TAXPAYERS HAVE A VOICE IN THE PROCESS BEFORE TURNING IT OVER. TO AN ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTMENT. I THINK IT'S DOING EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE DOING HERE TODAY -- PROVIDING THE OVERSIGHT OF REALLY A CONTINUING. TO ENGAGE WITH THE DEPARTMENTS OF WITH RESPECT -- TO HOW THEY'RE OF FUNCTIONS ARE ARE BEING CARRIED OUT AND WHAT IMPROVEMENTS MAY NEED TO BE MADE IF THE TAXPAYERS INDEED ARE NOT. OF ADEQUATELY SIR. KIND OF A STEEP DIVE IS A IN ALL OF US WERE ELECTED OFFICIALS AS I SAID EARLIER TAXPAYER ADVOCATES OF I STILL DO MY SHARE OF CONSTITUENT WORK AND I AS I'M SURE ALL OF YOUR OFFICES DO WAS WELL. AND I KNOW THAT WHAT GIVES ME CONFIDENCE WHEN WE DO IT IS THAT WHEN WE DO WE FOR MANY OF THESE MATTERS TO THE BROTHERS TO THE TAXPAYER OF ADVOCATES OFFICE IN EACH OF OUR TAX AGENCIES OR TO THE SPECIFIC PROGRAMS WITH EACH AND WITHIN EACH OF THE TAX. AGENCY'S THAT'S THE RESPONSE BACK TO TAXPAYERS WILL BE UNIFORM FROM ONE DOCTOR TO ANOTHER. AND THE I'M NOT SO SURE THAT WE GET THAT WITH AN ELECTED BOARD OF THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION BECAUSE THEY EACH HAVE DIFFERENT WAYS. OF INTERACTING WITH THEIR A CONSTITUENCY ALSO JUST -- SAY THAT WITH RESPECT TO THE TAXPAYERS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WITH WITH WITH REGARD TO THE CURRENT DUTIES OF THE BOARD WE'RE TALKING ABOUT STATE ASSESSES. THESE ARE SOPHISTICATED TAXPAYERS PUBLIC UTILITIES RAILROADS -- THE OTHER STILL IS OVERSIGHT OVER -- THE GAS TAX -- BUT THESE ARE. TAXPAYERS WHO DO BUSINESS WITH THE STATE WHAT WILL NEED TO BE CLEAR WITH ANY KND OF CHANGES WHO ARE THEY DOING BUSINESS WITH. AND WHAT ARE THE EXPECTATIONS OF THE RELATIONSHIP OF THAT ENTITY WITH THE TAX PAYER. AND THAT COULD BE DEFINED AND CERTAINLY HAS A SO THE ONGOING OVERSIGHT OF THAT NEEDS TO CONTINUE TO BE ROBUST. BUT IT IS UNIFORMLY TO BE AS IMPORTANT OF A TAXPAYER SHOULD NOT -- EXPECT THAT BY VIRTUE OF THE WHO'S REPRESENTING THEM WHETHER IT BE ANY OF US AS LEGISLATORS OR OR ESTATE MY CONSTITUTIONAL OFFICERS THAT THEY'RE NOT GOING TO RECEIVE THE SAME SERVICE. ASIDE ANY OTHER TAXPAYER SO -- UNIFORMITY IS KEY FOR TALKING ABOUT A VERY FINITE SET OF TAXPAYERS WITH RESPECT TO THE CURRENT BOARD OF EQUALIZATION DUTIES. AND I DO BELIEVE THAT -- THEY WILL BE -- WILL SERVE UP REALLY ANYWHERE IN STATE GOVERNMENT SONGS EXPECTATIONS ARE CLEARER AND THERE IS AN AVENUE FOR A TAXPAYER RIGHTS ADVOCATES OFFICE TO ALSO BE THE CONDUIT FOR VERY COMPLEX MATTERS. I WILL HAVE A A CLOSING COMMENT BUT I WANT TO ASK YOU ONE FINAL QUESTION IN IT STEVE -- ONE FINAL TIME FROM THIS COMMITTEE COMMITTEES TO BE ABLE TO SEE IF WE HAVE ANY CLOSING COMMENTS FROM EITHER OF YOU BEFORE WE TURN OVER THE BE A WE CHAIR. ADVICE FOR THE MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE AS WE MOVE FORWARD ALONG WITH SENATOR RISES COMMITTEES CAN CONTINUE TO EVALUATE THIS ISSUE. WE'RE ALSO GONNA BE BRINGING IN THE COPPER DEPARTMENT TAX AND FEE ADMINISTRATION TO DO OVERSIGHT IN THEM AS WELL. AS OVER THE LAST TWENTY MONTHS -- WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE CHALLENGES THERE. WHAT ADVICE DO YOU HAVE PARTING ADVICE -- FOR THE LEGISLATURES WE CONSIDER TO BE ALWAYS FUTURE. I THANK YOU ALL. OLIVIA NAILED IT ON THE HEAD I MEAN I THINK THE FIRST AND FOREMOST FOCUS HAS TO BE ON OF THE PROGRAMS AND HOW BEST TO CARRY OUT THOSE PROGRAMS ON BEHALF OF THE TAXPAYERS. OF THE HAS TO BE THE FOCUS OF THE CONVERSATION. AND I HOPE IN THE COURSE OF YOUR DELIBERATIONS YOU WILL ALSO -- SIX SOME OF THE INPUT FROM OUR TAXPAYER GROUPS AS WELL -- AND I THINK WE ALL WANT THE SAME THING. THE QUESTION IS HOW ARE WE GOING TO CARRY IT OUT AND THAT -- WHEN WE LOOK AT CALIFORNIA WITH OUR UNIQUE SITUATION HAVING THE ONLY LIKE THE TAX COMMISSION? AND LOOKING AT THE SUCCESS OF FORTY NINE OTHER STATES -- WITH THE VARIOUS -- STRUCTURES THAT THEY HAVE THAT -- THE NEED FOR AN ELECTED BOARD IS OF NO LONGER. AND AND IF WE GET THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION IS -- NO WE DON'T NEED ELECTED BOARD THEN I THINK THE QUESTIONS ARE VERY CLEAR. FOR OF ALL OF YOU HERE AND THAT IS SO WHERE DO WE HOUSE THESE PROGRAMS WHERE DO WE CONTINUE TO CONTINUE WHAT WE WHAT WE CAN TAKE THE BE SURE THE EXPERTISE OF REMAINS ROBUST AND KEYS TO GET DEVELOPED. AND HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT TAXPAYERS HAVE ACCESS. TO THE SERVICES THAT THEY ARE ENTITLED TO AND IT'S VERY SO -- ON A SEVEN THAT -- THE CHAIR OF TRANSPORTATION ADVANCED HERE IN REGARDS TO GAS TAX. OXMAN LEE. EIGHTEEN TWENTY pINTO THE ISSUE OF MEDICAL CANNABIS IN CALIFORNIA BECAME VERY AWARE THAT THERE WERE POLITICAL DECISIONS MADE -- AT A PREVIOUS BOARD THE PREVIOUS BOARD ON TO ACTUALLY COLLECT THE TAX ON CANNABIS AND WAS BASED ON ONE INDIVIDUAL BOARD MEMBERS OPINION NOT TO COLLECT TAX. AND I WILL SHARE WITH YOU. IN THE AREA THAT I REPRESENT THE BOARD MEMBER FOLLOWTHE LAW OF CALIFORNIA VOTERS AND ENSURE THAT THERE IS TAX COLLECTED. AND THAT WAS A DEEP CONCERN OF INAPPROPRIATE MEDDLING -- WHEN THE VOTERS HAVE SPOKEN ANY TAX RATE WAS SET IN THE BOARD WAS NOT COLLECTING ON AN EVEN BASIS BECAUSE OF BOARD MEMBER INVOLVEMENT -- AND I WILL SAY. THAT NUMBER IS NO LONGER THERE -- BUT THAT IS A DEEP CONCERN WHEN. ELECTED OFFICIALS INAPPROPRIATELY METAL -- ANGLE AGAIN STATE LAW. I IN THAT HAS REALLY THAT IS WHEN MY INTEREST WAS PIQUED OUR PARTICULARLY WITHIN THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION AS THAT ACTION HAD TO BE STOPPED. END OF MOVEMENT WAS MADE TO DO THAT BUT AT THAT WAS OF GREAT CONCERN CENTER ABOUT. I WAS DOING SOME CHUCHUS OVER SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS WE LOST. SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. BY THEM NOT FOLLOWING THE RULES. SO SO I THINK I'LL GET THE LIST OF ALL THE PROJECTS AND ALL YOUR DISTRICTS. HOW MUCH EACH CITY LOST -- WILL GET THAT INFORMATION TO YOU -- IT WAS A TRAVESTY IN MY OPINION. THANK YOU SO MUCH. MADAM CENTER I'D LIKE TO MAKE ONE LAST COMMENT -- WE MADE THE CHANGES THAT WE MADE LAST YEAR AND I THINK THAT THIS THIS TOPIC DESERVES MUCH MORE ATTENTION THAT THAN WHAT WAS GIVEN TO IT LAST YEAR AND THAT. WE SHOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THE FULL LEGISLATIVE YEAR TO LOOK AT OTHER PROPOSALS FOR HOW TO HANDLE THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION. MY CONCERN IS THAT BY DISMANTLING THE BOARD ALL TOGETHER AND LEAVING ALL OF THE DECISION MAKING AND THE APPEALS MATTERS AND ALL OF THE WORK. TO STATE AGENCIES ALONG WITHOUT ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES WHO ARE ACCOUNTABLE TO THE TAXPAYERS THAT WE ARE IN THE POSITION OF THEN LEAVING THE TAXPAYER WITH LESS THAN A PUBLIC DEFENDER -- SO I HOPE THAT WE WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK AT HOW WE CAN MODERNIZE AND AND RESTRUCTURE THE ROLE OF THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION TO GET BACK TO THE ORIGINAL INTENT WHICH WAS. PROTECTING TAXPAYERS AND AND THEN EMPHASIZING PROTECTION OF TAXPAYER DOLLARS. THANK YOU SO MUCH SOONER BUT I'M SURE ONE MORE QUESTION. BECAUSE OF THE EXAMPLE THAT YOU YOU GAVE CENTER MCGUIRE AND THE EXAMPLE THAT SENATOR DOLE GAVE. WHAT DO YOU THINK CONTROLLER WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT UNDER. A NEW A STRUCTURE WITHOUT THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION AN ELECTED BOARD OF EQUALIZATION. WHAT HOW WOULD THAT HAVE BEEN DEALT WITH -- WHY WOULD THE RESULT BE DIFFERENT SURE OF THANK YOU MADAM CHAIRWOMAN THE -- I BELIEVE THE RESULT WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT BECAUSE THE OVERSIGHT THE POINTS OF OVERSIGHT. RESPONSIBILITY WOULD BE DIFFERENT OF THE MEMBERS AND CERTAINLY NOW WITH EXECUTIVE BRANCH OF DEPARTMENTS. OF THAT RESPONSIBILITY THE COUNT REALLY RESIDES WITH -- WELL FIRST IN MY WITH MY OLD OUT ON A DEPARTMENT FINANCE WILL BE YOU KNOW REALLY -- TO ACCEPT THAT IS A REVENUE GENERATING ORGANIZATIONS WILL BE CERTAINLY MONITORING THE REVIEWS ARE BEING GENERATED OF THE LIST AS CENTER BILLS EXAMPLE WITH RESPECT TO THE TRUE UP ON THE GAS TAX WHAT WAS -- A SOMETHING INDICATIVE OF A KIND OF A ROLE THAT I PREVIOUSLY PLAYED AT THE FARM TO FINANCE ASSISTANT DEPUTY DIRECTOR WOULD ENSURE THAT THAT TRIP HAPPEN THAT CAN BE DONE ADMINISTRATIVELY -- AND I THINK -- BECAUSE THEY'RE SOME OF THE POLITICAL OVERTONES TO THAT TRUE UP WHEN I THOUGHT THE LEGISLATIVE INTENT WAS VERY CLEAR ABOUT THE REVENUE JOLLITY. OF THAT COULD HAVE BEEN AN ADMINISTRATIVE DUTIES THAT COULD HAVE BEEN CARRIED OUT AND THEN THE OBVIOUSLY THE SECOND BRANCH OUT RESPONSIBLE. SO THIS IS -- AND AND THEN OBVIOUSLY A BEFORE ALL OF YOU. AS YOU'RE DELIBERATING OVER THE BUDGET -- DELIBERATING OVER THE FUNCTIONS OF THESE ORGANIZATIONS -- IN THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH HOW TO BE SURE IT'S ABILITIES -- NIELSEN [inaudible] BURTON AUTOMATION -- YOU ALL. THE LATEST. THE ISSUE OF ORDERS [inaudible] WHAT [inaudible] AND THIS [inaudible] GREATER PROBLEMS. FACT THAT ALMOST EVERY AGENCY. THE STAFF OF ALMOST EVERY. DOES THE SAME THING. REGULARLY TRYING TO UNDERMINE THE INTENT. OF THE LEGISLATURE. THAT'S REALLY A HUGE FRUSTRATION. CONTROL RIGHT EAT IN TERMS OF THE THE CITIZENS. ACCESS [inaudible] UNDERSTANDING. THEY'RE USED TO A BOARD OF EQUALIZATION. SENDING LETTERS IN -- CONTACTING IN SOME MANNER OR WAY. UNDER THE NEW CONFIGURATION. WHAT'S GONNA BE REQUIRED. TO EDUCATE THE PUBLIC TO THE NEW WAYS. THE VOICE THEIR OPINIONS. AS THE NOTE NEW DELEGATIONS HAVE OCCURRED AND SETTLE IN SURE IT'S GOING TO BE VERY CONFUSING ISN'T IT. WELL HA NEED NOT BE A METHOD OF TAXPAYER EDUCATION IS ALWAYS IN ORDER AND THE NEW DEPARTMENTS HAVE DEFINITELY BEEN ENGAGED IN THAT WITH. VARIOUS -- TAXPAYER GROUPS -- TAXPAYER ADVOCATE GROUPS AND CERTAINLY PRACTITIONERS A SMALL OF I KNOW WE DO HAVE A REPRESENTATIVE OF HE OF CITY TFA HERE. FOR A SPECIFIC -- ACTIVITIES AT THEIR UNDERGO I THINK -- FOR ANY AGENCY TO DO ITS JOB WELL THE SERVE THE PUBLIC THAT HAS TO BE A STRONG ARM WITH RESPECT TO HOW WE REACH OUT TO OUR CONSTITUENTS. AND THE BUSINESS THAT WE DO AND HOW WE SERVE [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] TOO MUCH. PLEASE IN GENERAL LIKE MANY OTHER ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FOR THE CONTROLLER. XENON MANAGEMENT COLOR ANY CLOSING COMMENTS FOR THE COMMITTEE OF THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU MADAM CHAIRWOMAN OF AND THANK YOU FOR STARTING THIS -- PROCESS IN THE OF THE DELIBERATIONS ON THIS MATTER EARLY. IN THE LEGISLATIVE YEAR -- TO CENTER GIRLS YANNI'S POINT I THINK A YEAR THE OVERSIGHT RESPONSIBILITY THAT ALL THIS YEAR IS ONE THAT IS IMPORTANT -- CERTAINLY HAVING MORE OF IT AIRED IN PUBLIC -- AND NOT -- BEHIND CLOSED DOORS IS ALWAYS IN ORDER SO -- AND I APPRECIATE THE THE SPIRIT AND SAY WITH RESPECT TO YOUR LAST COMMENT MISTER CHAIRMAN OF IS EXACTLY THE POINT. OF I THINK THE WORST CASE SCENARIO WOULD BE IF WE HAD TO SIMILARLY SITUATED TAXPAYERS WHO ARE TREATED -- DIFFERENTLY. AND I'VE AND I THINK WE COULD INSURE CERTAINLY WITH OUR COLLECTIVE OVERSIGHT THAT THAT WILL HAPPEN IS WHEN WE HAVE ALL THESE FUNCTIONS MOVED INTO. OF AN ENTITY THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO MONITOR AND CERTAINLY I'LL HOLD THEIR FEET TO THE FIRE. ACTUALLY THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TODAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH YOUR COMMENTS.

THE SINS THAT WERE COMMITTED ON THE PREVIOUS CALL HAD AN IMPACT ON OUR ABILITY OF OF OF OF OF WHAT WE ARE DOING -- TODAY -- EACH OF US WAS ELECTED BY THE PEOPLE IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN DURING THE GENERAL ELECTION TO SERVE ON THE ONLY ELECTED TAX BODY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA EXCUSE ME IN THE UNITED STATES. IT IS AN HONOR TO REPRESENT TEN MILLION PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN MY TWENTY THREE COUNTIES THAT I REPRESENT WITH THAT INTRODUCTION LET ME GO DIRECTLY TO THE ISSUE AT HAND. WHAT SHOULD THE FUTURE THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION BE? SPECIFICALLY SHOULD THE LEGISLATURE VOTE TO PUT A MEASURE BEFORE THE PEOPLE AND AND TWENTY TWENTY GENERAL ELECTION TO ELIMINATE TE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION. AND TO TRANSFER ITS CONSTITUTIONAL POWERS TO ATTACKS AGENCY -- IN OTHER WORDS A BUREAUCRACY. WHEN I RAN FOR THE BOARD IT WAS CERTAINLY? NO SECRET THAT THE CURRENT DEAL WE WAS UNDER -- CHALLENGES AND I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE NUMBER WHERE YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT AND THAT. AND MANY OF YOU UP HERE ACTUALLY SUPPORTED ME IN IN THAT ENDEAVOR WE'VE HAD VERY HONEST AND CANDID CONVERSATIONS THROUGHOUT THIS ENTIRE TIME NOT ONLY DURING THE TIME OF THE ELECTION SEASON BUT ALSO WHERE WE ARE TODAY. ABOUT THE EVOLVING ROLE OF THE STATE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION. AND WHEN I RAN IT WAS WITH SOME EXPERIENCE AS AN ELECTED OFFICIAL WHO UNDERSTOOD THE IMPORTANCE OF FAIR OF EQUITABLE -- REVENUE COLLECTION AND DISTRIBUTE JUST BY WAY OF BACKGROUND ON THE FORMER CHAIR OF THE BUDGET AND FINANCE COMMITTEE WHICH IS AN ELEVEN BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET IN THE CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO. I'M A TWO TERM TWICE ELECTED -- SUPERVISOR AND ALSO ELECTED BY COLLEAGUES ARE SERVICEABLE AT THE BOARD PRESIDENT. AND IN THIS ROLE IN MY LAST EIGHT YEARS I ALSO SERVED AS A TRANSPORTATION ON THE TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY WHICH WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF PROPERTY -- THIS -- THE PROP K. DOLLARS TO INSIST TO TO DEVELOP PROJECTS -- TO ASSIST WITH INFRASTRUCTURE AND TRANSPORTATION NEEDS I HAVE SHARED AND HAVE SERVED ON THE LAND USE COMMITTEE AND UNDERSTAND LAND USE ISSUES -- AS A GREATLY. CHALLENGE SAN FRANCISCO. WITH THE KNOWLEDGE AND PERSONAL EXPERIENCE I SUPPORTED THE GOALS OF EIGHTY ONE UP TO THE TAXPAYER TRANCE VERY SEE AND FAIRNESS ACT OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND I BELIEVE I DO BELIEVE I BELIEVE IT THEN AND I BELIEVE IT NOW THAT TAXPAYERS HAVE A RIGHT. TO TAX ADMINISTRATION AND APPEAL AND AND AN APPEAL PROCESS THAT IS FAIR THAT IS TRANSPARENT THAT IS CONSISTENT THAT IS EQUITABLE THAT IS IMPARTIAL. AND I JUST WANT TO REMIND YOU THAT I COME FROM A DISTRICT THAT HAS HISTORICALLY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN LOCKED OUT. DISENFRANCHISED AND HAVE HAD NO VOICE AND I AM VERY MUCH IN TUNE IN CONNECTED TO THESE TYPES OF COMMUNITIES WHERE COMMUNITIES WHERE PEOPLE SPEAK ENGLISH AS A SECOND LANGUAGE WHERE THEIR IMMIGRATION STATUS IS QUESTIONABLE. AND HAVE BEEN ON THE SIDE OF SOCIAL JUSTICE AND FIGHTING FOR JUSTICE -- WHEN IT COMES TO REFORMS -- TREES THAT THEY ARE ALL UNITED STATES NAVY -- REPRESENTING A DISTRICT WITH A SUPERFUND SITE -- BRINGING ON AND TAKING ON POLICE REFORM -- AS WELL AS THE SUGARY BEVERAGE INDUSTRIES I CERTAINLY HAVE A PERSPECTIVE WHEN IT COMES TO FIGHTING AND FIGHTING FOR THE RIGHTS AND ON BEHALF OF PEOPLE AND IN THE WAKE OF THE REFORMS ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE NEW AGENCY WAS FORMED IN THAT DEPARTMENT OF TAX AND FEE ADMINISTRATION. AND A NEW OFFICE OF TAX APPEALS WAS SET UP TO HEAR THESE APPEALS I'M GRATEFUL TO LEARN SENATOR MCGUIRE THAT YOU TOO WILL BE CARRYING ON HEARINGS TO ADDRESS. SOME OF THE CHALLENGES AND AND QUITE HONESTLY DO A SWOT ANALYSIS WHAT'S WORKING WITH THE STRAINS ONE OF THE WEAKNESSES THE OPPORTUNITIES AND AND AND THE THREATS HOPEFULLY PAYING ATTENTION TO THE THREATS. OF THE THAT THE TAXPAYERS ARE FACING. IT IS APPROPRIATE NOW THAT OVER TWENTY MONTHS THAT SINCE THE PASSAGE OF A B. ONE OH TWO FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO REVIEW THOSE OPERATIONS OF THESE NEW AGENCIES TO SEE IF THE OBJECTIVE OF THE LEGISLATURE. IF THE OBJECTIVE IS BEING MET. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY TO SEE IF THE INTEREST OF THE TAXPAYERS ARE BEING FOR PHIL NOW THESE ARE THE SAME TAXPAYERS THAT YOU ARE ALSO ELECTED TO REPRESENT AS WELL AS I HERE -- IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE I JUST WANT TO ADDRESS THE OBVIOUS BECAUSE WE ARE THE MOST DISCUSSION UPSET UP INTO THIS ONE HAS SUBSEQUENTLY BEEN ABOUT THE PREVIOUS BOARD OF EQUALIZATION AND NOW HERE WE ARE A MEMBER OF THE NEW BOARD. I'M TELLING JUST SHY EIGHT WEEKS AND COMING INTO THIS POSITION AND ALMOST IN A POSITION TO DEFEND. CHANGES OF WHAT'S HAPPENING AND DEFEND WHAT WE WHERE WE ARE AND WHAT WE ARE DEALING WITH TODAY. AND AND MAKE THE CASE FOR KEEPING THE THE BOARD ELECTED AND I'M GONNA HAVE TO JUST PAY THAT TO OUR FOREFATHERS I MEAN PEOPLE YOU SAID IN YOUR OPENING REMARKS A HUNDRED AND FORTY YEARS. AND WHITE WHY DID THE MEN. DECIDE TO MAKE THE STATE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION. CONSTITUTION ELECTED BODY BECAUSE THERE WAS CORRUPTION. THERE WAS AN TRANSPARENCY. THERE WAS AN AN EQUITABLE WAY BETTER BUSINESS IS BEING DONE. AND I AM OF THE MINDSET THAT WE MUST UNDERSTAND A LOOK AT OUR PAST IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND A MOVE FORWARD TO MOVE INTO THE FUTURE. AND I THINK IT WOULD BE SHORT SIGHTED OF US. TO NOT TO ACKNOWLEDGE ALL FOR A HUNDRED AND FORTY YEAR HISTORY NOW IN THAT HISTORY IS IN THE HISTORY OF THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES WHICH BY THE WAY IS A HUNDRED OR TWO HUNDRED TWENTY NINE YEARS OLD. WE NEED TO BE THOUGHTFUL IN THE APPROACH. AND WE ARE A DEMOCRACY AN ELECTED BODY. AND THAT IS SERIOUS PEOPLE HAVE GIVEN THEIR LIVES TO MAINTAIN -- THIS DEMOCRACY. AND MY CASE FOR KEEPING THAT THIS BODY ELECTED A REALLY STEMS FROM MAKING SURE THAT IT IS THAT THIS BODY CONTINUES TO BE VITAL IN ANY CAN FULFILL ITS CONSTITUTIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES. IN THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD. IN THE CONTROLLERS REMARK SHE SAID THAT NO THIS IS THE ONLY TAX WERE ELECTED ACROSS THE ACROSS THE UNITED STATES I SAY ABSOLUTELY CALIFORNIA DO THING WE DO THINGS DIFFERENTLY. AND UPHOLD OUR GOVERNOR THIS IS THE CALIFORNIA DREAM. RIGHT PEOPLE WANT TO BE HERE THEY WANT. WE ARE AT THE STANDARD WE DON'T LOOK TO OTHERS TO HELP US DETERMINE WHERE AND WHAT DIRECTION WE SHOULD GO IN. HIGHLIGHTING THE INITIATIVE PROCESS THERE FEW STATES THAT DO THAT PROCESS. AND I BELIEVE OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENT OUR DEMOCRACY IS IN. RICH BECAUSE OF THAT PROCESS BECAUSE OF THE ELECTORAL PROCESS AND WE SHOULD CONTINUE TO BE INDUSTRY LEADERS THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION AND ITS BOARD MEMBERS IF THEY ARE THE ONLY ELECTED BODY SPECIFICALLY CONSTITUTED. TO REPRESENT THE INTERESTS OF TAXPAYERS PERIOD. WE ARE ONE OF THE MOST DIVERSE AND REPRESENTATIVE ELECTED BODIES IN CALIFORNIA GOVERNMENT TO DATE I WANT TO NOTE THAT WE HAVE FINALLY ELECTED THE FIRST LATINO. YOU HAVE BEFORE YOU THE FIRST AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMAN WE HAVE A MEMBER ON THIS BODY THAT IS EIGHTY PLUS YEARS OLD. AND WE HAVE. A COLLEGIAL FOUGHT FOR WORKING PROCESS TECHNOLOGY THAT WE'VE ONLY HAD TWO BOARD MEETINGS WE'VE BEEN IN THIS POSITION FOR WHAT A LITTLE ALMOST ALMOST SHY OF NINE WEEKS. BUT NOW WE ARE TURNING THE CORNER NOW WE ARE MOVING IN A DIRECTION WHERE THAT WE ARE STEPPING INTO THE NEW FRONTIER ABOUT THAT THE FUTURE OF THE STATE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION WHERE I WOULD MAKE THE ARGUMENT THAT IT IS EVEN MORE REPRESENTATIVE THAN WHAT IT WAS BEFORE. I'M PROUD TO BE A MEMBER OF THE BOARD WHICH HAS A BROAD CROSS SECTION OF CALIFORNIA'S OF DIVERSITY WHICH IS FINALLY VISIBLY PRESENT ON THE DS WHEN OUR MEETINGS BEGAN. ELECTED COUNTY ASSESSOR'S DESERVE THE RESPECT. IMPLIED IN THEIR OFFICE AND DESERVE TO HAVE A COLLEGIAL RELATIONSHIP WITH AN ELECTED BOARD NOT A SUBSERVIENT RELATIONSHIP. TO STATE BUREAUCRATS AND I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT BECAUSE THESE MOST ASSESSORS NOT ALL IN OUR COUNTY IN OUR IN OUR STATE WE HAVE FIFTY EIGHT OF THEM. ARE ELECTED TO SERVE WHICH MEANS THEY TO GO ON THE BALLOT AND THEY GO AND THEY PUT FOR THE WORK IN A PUT FOR A PLATFORM. TO TO APPEAL TO VOTERS CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS DESERVE TO HAVE THE PROPERTY VALUES OF OUR LARGEST PUBLIC UTILITIES ESTABLISHED. DONE AN OPEN FORUM BY ELECTED AND ACCOUNTABLE OFFICIALS NOW LET'S TAKE THAT AND UNPACK THAT FOR A MOMENT. TAXPAYERS DESERVE TO PROPERTY VALUES OF OUR LARGEST PUBLIC UTILITIES TO TO BE DONE IN OPEN FORUM THINK ABOUT THE C. P. U. C. NOT ONE PERSON IS ELECTED OVER THER BUT WE'VE GOT CORRUPTION CHARGES OVER THERE. ABOUT THE FAIR ADMINISTRATION. OR MAYBE THE UNDER HANDEDNESS OF P. JEANNIE EXECUTIVES WE'RE GOING TO BE STRAIGHT AND FORARD IN OUR DISCUSSIONS TODAY. PGA ANY ONE OF OUR LARGEST RETAILERS ARE DEALING WITH BANKRUPTCY. HOW DOES THAT HAVE AN IMPACT ON THIS ENTIRE CLIMATE THAT WERE AND WE AS A PROPERTY ASSESSMENT BODY? DEAL WITH THE ASSESSMENT OF THESE PROPERTIES NOW IS NOT THE TIME TO DISMANTLE OR TO BREAK AWAY AND AND TRANSFER THINGS INTO ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE QUITE FRANKLY. ON THE VERGE OF TRYING TO STAND UP AND YOU WILL WE WILL DISCUSS I'M SURE SOME OF THE CHALLENGES -- AT A LATER DATE. BUT REALLY NOW YOU WANT TO DISMANTLE I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S IF IF THAT'S THE RIGHT TIME. I VALUE THE WORK I DO AND QUITE FRANKLY I WELCOME THE RESPONSIBILITY OF MY OFFICE NOW LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT WORKLOAD SENATOR MCGUIRE. WE REVIEW -- REVIEWING PROPERTY TAX CASES FOR PUBLICATION NOW -- THE CONTROLLER TALK TO A LOT OF IT WAS JUST ABOUT SALES ND USE TAX AND THE SINS OF THE PREVIOUS BOARD. SALES AND USE TAX TOOK. DAYS AND QUITE FRANKLY ON THE AGENDA WHEN I'M REVIEWING IT THEY WERE ONE OR TWO CASES THAT TOOK A LION'S SHARE OF THE ENERGY OF THE STAFF WHEN THEY WERE MAKING THEIR PRESENTATIONS THEM AND AND BOARD MEMBERS WHEN THEY WERE DELIBERATING. AND I'M SORRY THIS IS NOT GONNA COUNT AGAINST YOUR TIME I DON'T MEAN TO INTERRUPT I JUST WANNA DO QUICK TIME CHECK YOUR AT TEN MINUTES S. WANNA MAKE SURE IF YOU WANT YOUR EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR TO ALSO SPEAK WE WANT TO LEAVE TIME FOR HER. AGAIN THIS IS NOT ONLY APPRECIATE THAT -- I TOTALLY APPRECIATE THAT BUT I TOO WAS WATCHING THE TIME A LITTLE BIT IN. MAY PERHAPS THEY COULD HAVE THE SAME COURTESY THAT WAS GIVEN TO THE CONTROLLER SHE THE CONTROL SPOKE FOR APPROXIMATELY SEVEN MINUTES OKAY. SO IN REVIEWING THE NEW PROPERTY TAX HANDBOOKS THAT IS ISSUED -- OUR JOB IS ALSO REVIEWING THE TAXPAYER RIGHTS' PUBLICATIONS AND AND REPORTS TO ENSURE THAT OUR OUTREACH IS APPROPRIATE AND EFFECTIVE. I WILL DEFER TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR BECAUSE IN HER REPORT SHE ALSO HAS -- THE OUTLAYS THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE STATE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION AND I THANK YOU FOR THE TIME CHECK AND I WILL GIVE THE REST OF MY TIME TO MISS BRENDA FLEMING IS A VERY TALENTED. PROFESSIONAL THAT HAS BEEN A POINT FUTURE OF THE B. AWAY. THANK YOU SO MUCH MANAGER AGAIN NOT AT ALL TRYING TO INTERRUPT I JUST WANTED YOU TO BE AWARE AND WE CAN ALSO COVERED THE SHOW ITEMS IN QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. ADAM EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR WE WELCOME YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE I I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY ABOUT FIVE MINUTES -- AND TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS DISCUSSION AND KNOWLEDGE IN MY CHAIR BY SHARON ON BEHALF OF OUR ORGANIZATION WE APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY JUST TO PRESENT BEFORE YOU -- AS MENTIONED MY NAME IS BRENDA FLEMING AND THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR RECENTLY APPOINTED PER MILLION ON THE JANUARY BOARD MEETING. I HAVE HOWEVER BEEN ON THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION SINCE -- TWENTY ELEVEN I'D LIKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE SOME FIRST HAND EXPERIENCES -- FROM THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE TOWN'S. TAXPAYER TRANSPARENCY AND FAIRNESS ACT -- AND PROVIDE SOME INPUT PERHAPS IN SOME SOME INSIGHTS ABOUT. MAYBE SOME OF THE UNINTENDED OUTCOMES. A LITTLE BIT OF HISTORY I'M SURE YOU KNOW. YOU'VE HEARD THIS BEFORE BUT JUST FOR KIDS FOR BACKGROUND ESTABLISHED IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY NINE BY CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION IS IN FACT CHARGED WITH THE RESPONSIBILITY. OF ENSURING COUNTY PROPERTY TAX ASSESSMENTS PRACTICES WERE EQUAL IN UNIFORM THROUGHOUT THE STATE. LEGISLATIVE CHANGES EXPANDED THE BILLS TO BE ALWAYS ROLE TO ADMINISTER ADDITIONAL TAXES AND FEES AND SO JULY FIRST. TWENTY SEVENTEEN THAT MILESTONE DATE RETURN TO BE WE TO ITS CONSTITUTIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES. THE CURRENT BE AWAY WHICH WE AFFECTIONATELY REFERRED TO AS B. WE TO IT AT ALL -- IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PROPERTY TAX PROGRAMS INCLUDING ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGE TAX TAX ON INSURERS IN PRIVATE REBEL CARS. THE BOP HAS APPROXIMATELY TWO HUNDRED EXPERTISE AND ADMINISTRATION. THE MAJORITY OF THOSE -- TWO HUNDRED OUR STATE THE STATE'S EXPERTS AND COUNTY SAYS PROPERTIES STATUS AS PROPERTIES EXCEPT FROM. THE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTY ASSESSOR'S THE STATUS AS PUBLIC UTILITY COMPANIES THE RAILROAD COMPANIES. AND A BROAD ARRAY OF TAX INDUSTRY PROFESSIONALS AND TAX PAYER ADVOCATES RELY ON THE PEOPLE THE FUNCTIONS IN THE SERVICES OF BE AWAY. ONE COULD SAY. B. WE AND I SAID FINALLY BE WE SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS ARE AMONG THE STATE'S MOST VALUABLE RESOURCES. FOR REFERENCE MEMBERS CALIFORNIA PROPERTY TAX LEVIES FOR FISCAL YEAR SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN WERE APPROXIMATELY SIXTY SIX POINT FIVE BILLION WHICH IS A 7% INCREASE OVER THE PREVIOUS YEAR. IN THE SAME YEAR THE ASSESSED VALUE FOR STATUS AS PROPERTIES WAS A HUNDRED FIVE POINT FIVE BILLION. WHICH IS AN INCREASE OF TWO POINT ONE BILLION FROM THE PRIOR YEAR'S VALUES. FURTHER FOR SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN THE COUNTY SAYS PROPERTY VALUES REACHED FIVE POINT SEVEN TRILLION DOLLARS I LOVE THAT NUMBER. COUNTY SAYS PROPERTIES PRODUCED AN ESTIMATED SIXTY POINT SIX TWO BILLION DOLLARS AND LOCAL PROPERTY TAX REVENUES FOR THE SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN FISCAL YEAR. AS ONE OF THE MANY EMPLOYEES WHO EXPERIENCED THE TRANSITION FROM B. O. E. ONE BATTLE TO BE WE TO DOUBT -- THE IMPACT WAS IMMEDIATE. AND OPERATIONALLY VERY DIFFICULT. ALLOW ME TO CITE A FEW EXAMPLES IF I MIGHT. SO JUST IMAGINE THIS IN TERMS OF RUNNING A VIDEO [inaudible] ON JUNE. THIRTIETH. TWENTY SEVENTEEN PROPERTY TAX DEPARTMENT. WAS ONE OF SIX B. WEE DEPARTMENT'S. INTERNAL OPERATIONAL DEPARTMENTS. SUPPORTED BY ABOUT TWENTY LEGAL STAFF. APPROXIMATELY TEN OF THOSE LEGAL STAFF WERE -- ATTORNEYS WITH PROPERTY TAX EXPERTISE. ON JULY FIRST THE VERY NEXT DAY. THE PROPERTY TAX DEPARTMENT HAD TO PROPERTY TAX ATTORNEYS. THIS IMPACTED DIRECTLY OBVIOUSLY OUR ABILITY TO PROCESS LEGAL OPINIONS SUMMER DECISIONS AND A NUMBER OF OTHER LEGAL DOCUMENTS MATERIALS. IT IS TAKEN I AM MORE THAN A YEAR JUST TO GET BACK. TO SEVEN UNDERSTANDING AND GETTING BACK TO THOSE SEVEN THEY DON'T HAVE THE DEPTH OF THE PROPERTY TAX EXPERIENCE THAT THE PRIOR -- STAFF HAD. ANOTHER EXAMPLE ON JUNE THIRTIETH TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE B. U. E. HAD ITS OWN ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES STAFF. THEY WERE ABLE -- TO PERFORM THEIR OWN WORK PERFORM THOSE FUNCTIONS DIRECTLY AND TO SET THE PRIORITIES FOR THAT WORK. THE NEXT DAY JULY FIRST ALL ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES WERE REMOVED AND BY STATUTE THERE ON JULY FIRST WE NOW HAD TO GO TO CITY TESFAYE TO GET THOSE SERVICES. THEREFORE LOST ITS CAPACITY YOUR PERFORMANCE ON ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTIONS OBVIOUSLY IMPACTING OUR OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCIES SO JUST A NOTE ALMOST EVERYTHING THAT WE NEED TO DO -- AND AGAIN IT'S NOT YOU KNOW NOT IN ANY WAY TO TO SAY ANYTHING -- KILL TOWARDS THE CHAIR FAY BUT IT A GOVERNMENT AGENCY HOW BEAT A SMALL ONE WE HAVE TO GO TO ANOTHER AGENCY TO GET THOSE SERVICES. ON JUNE THIRTIETH AS ANOTHER EXAMPLE. ENGINE THIRTY FIVE BILLY WAS A FRIDAY REMEMBER SITTING MY DESK DEALING WITH SOME OF THESE ISSUES. VOA SYSTEMS AND IMAGINE THIS SYSTEMS AND INFORMATION THAT WAS USED TYPICALLY USED BY YOU KNOW YOUR INTERNAL EMPLOYEES SECURE INTERNET WEBSITES ECCENTRIC -- PROVIDES OR CHARTS POLICY INFORMATION DIRECTORIES YOU KNOW BULLETINS JUST A AN INFORMATION RESOURCE. ON THE THIRTIETH THAT SYSTEM AND THAT INFORMATION APPLY TO BE AWAY THE NEXT DAY JULY FIRST. LITERALLY WAS MIRACULOUS OVERNIGHT CD TESFAYE STOOD UP THE NEW SITES IN THE NEW INFORMATION AND IT NOW REFLECTED CITY CAFE SO IF WE WENT TO LOOK FOR AN ORCHARD BASIC COURT CARTER OR DIRECTORY. ADS ON THE B. WE ORDER NO LONGER EXISTED. NOTE TO RESOLVE THESE ISSUES RELATED TO THIS CHANGE B. O. E. HAS TO AS I MENTIONED BEFORE IT'S ACTUALLY SUBMIT A REQUEST TO THE CD TESFAYE. JUST IN TERMS OF PROCESS JUST TO GET SOME PRETTY BASIC FUNCTIONS AND SERVICES. GENTLEMEN OVER NIGHT. THE BASIC FUNCTIONS AND RESOURCES NEEDED BY ALL STATE AGENCIES THIS IS I WORKED IN THE LEGISLATURE FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS SO I CAN YOU KNOW GET THE DATA THEY OPERATIONS. HIS BASIC FUNCTIONS THAT YOU NEED IS A GOVERNMENT ORGANIZATION -- POLICIES PHONE OFFICE SPACE INFORMATION -- EXCEPT FOR WERE GREATLY IMPACTED AND THE TIME FRAME AND THE COST THAT IT'S TAKING TO TRANSFORM ALL OF THAT MATERIAL FROM BE A WE WENT OUT ALL TO BE WE TO DIJO FULMINATE THE CITY TFA I'M INFORMATION RELATIVE TO SALES AND USE TAX ECCENTRICS AFTER. ALL OF THAT IS TAKING TIME AND ENERGY AND WE DON'T WHO DID THAT FORCE OBVIOUSLY WENT TO SEE TESFAYE. AN EXPECTED RETRIEVE ABOUT ONE MINUTE. ON A PERSONAL THANK YOU SIR ON A PERSONAL NOTE THESE ISSUES RELATED TO PROCESS THE SYSTEMS AND INFORMATION THAT RESTRAIN OUR ADMINISTRATIVE AND OPERATIONAL FUNCTIONS WERE NOT. THE ONLY UNEXPECTED OUTCOME. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE HAS BEEN THE IMPACT ON OUR PEOPLE -- AND THIS DRIVES HOME FOR US THESE ARE SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS OR AGAIN ARE AMONG THE STATE'S MOST VALUABLE RESOURCES. THE PERCEPTION HONESTLY AFTER THE REFORMS WAS THAT QUOTE VIEW WE WAS BLOWN UP. AND THAT -- YOUR FUTURE IS UNCERTAIN WHAT DOES THAT MEAN. IT'S NOT A HELPFUL SLOGAN WHEN WE TRY TO RECRUIT AND RETAIN STAFF. SO AS WE TRIED TO GET PROPERTY TAX EXPERTS NINETIES THE TEAM WE CAN'T JUST WE CAN'TDRIVE BY TARGET AND PICK UP THAT EXPERTISE TO TAKES DECADES TO GET THAT KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERTISE. AND SO WERE TRYING TO RECRUIT PEOPLE SAY IS TO DEVELOP AND MAINTAIN THAT TALENT TO SERVE THIS -- THIS INDUSTRY -- IT'S GETTING TO BE A PROGRESSIVELY MORE DIFFICULT. MY FINAL COMMENT I THINK I WOULD SAY WE CANNOT FAIL. TO PROTECT THE PEOPLE. THE KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERTISE THAT EXISTS WITHIN B. O. E.. ON BEHALF OF THE EMPLOYEES -- I EMPLOYEE AND I ASK YOU TO JOIN US IN THIS COMMITMENT TO TO PROTECT THOSE ASSETS. AGAIN THE LEGISLATION WAS NOT INTENDED TO REDUCE THESE OUT COMMON WE UNDERSTAND THAT. BY NO MEANS THATTHE LEGISLATIVE THEY WERE CONTAINED IN THE ORIGINAL LEGISLATIVE OBJECTIVE. IN FACT THE LEGISLATION CONTAINED OBJECTIVES TO HELP AND TO SUPPORT THE STAFF -- AND TO SUPPORT OUR CIVIL SERVICE EMPLOYEES. THAT SAID -- MANY ON INTO RECORD AS A RESULT OF THIS AND WE JUST NEED THE TIME TO ADDRESS THEM AND REBUILD AND REESTABLISH AND MODERNIZE. AND WE THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY. THANK YOU SO MUCH MA'AM EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR WHAT WE LIKE TO BE ABLE TO DO IS OPEN IT UP FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEES -- IN WE DO HAVE A JOINT LEGISLATIVE AUDIT COMMITTEE HAPPENING CONCURRENTLY I IN I KNOW WILL BE -- AND THAT'S WHERE MADAM CHAIR HAD RUN OFF TO TAKE A COUPLE VOTES IN HAD BACKS WE DO APOLOGIZE AND SHE CENTER APOLOGIES AS WELL. LIKE ME TO SEE IF WE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. FROM THE COMMITTEE THIS TIME I KNOW I HAVE A FEW BUT I WANT TO BE AT OFFER [inaudible] OKAY -- SO FEEL FREE BOTH VIA -- ONE OF YOU I MEAN IT'S GONNA GO THROUGH A SERIES OF QUESTIONS AND YOU LET ME KNOW HOW AND WHO YOU'D LIKE TO BE ABLE -- TO ANSWER [inaudible] SO. THE CHAIRWOMAN HAS ACCURATELY STATED THAT -- THE CHALLENGES OF THE PAST. I'M PARAPHRASING HERE BY THE WAY MADAM CHAIR. THE CHALLENGES OF THE PAST ON THE BOARD. WHO IS CURRENTLY SEED AND THE REASON WHY SOME OF THE REASONS WHY -- THE BOARD EQUALIZATION WAS CREATED. BECAUSE OF CORRUPTION THAT WE SAW BETWEEN COUNTIES PARTICULARLY THOSE COUNTIES THAT WERE GOLD MINING COUNTIES VERSUS COUNTIES THAT WERE. AGRICULTURAL COUNTIES -- THAT'S WHY THE BE A WE WAS ADVANCE. AND I DO BELIEVE THAT. ONE OF THE MAJOR REASONS WHY A B. ONE OF TWO SUCCESSFUL IS BECAUSE THE LACK OF TRANSPARENCY IN CANDIDLY. CORRUPTION -- OVER THE PAST TWENTY MONTHS I WILL. AGREE WITH THE CHAIR WOMAN -- IT'S A NEW BOARD. NO ONE WAS THERE. AT THE TIME AND WANTING TO BE ABLE TO SHIFT IN FOCUS ON THIS NEW DAY. SO I'D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO IT IF YOU ALL DON'T MIND TALK TO US HOW THAT CULTURE HAS CHANGED. SINCE THE LEGISLATURES ENACTED AB ONE TWO OVER THE LAST TWENTY MONTHS. RIGHT I'M GOING TO DO -- TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR TO TALK ABOUT FROM OF ADMINISTRATIVE PER -- REALITY A WELL WHERE WE ARE THE STAFF THANK YOU -- THANK YOU FOR THAT OPPORTUNITY I THINK PRIMARILY -- THE PRIOR BOARD BE WE WENT OUT ON IN ITS DUTIES HAD INVESTIGATORY RESPONSIBILITIES -- HAD H. R. RESPONSIBILITIES I WAS ABLE TO HIRE AND FIRE YOU KNOW EXECUTIVE STAFF -- CA SIX AFTER. HAD I'M A THIRTY TWO TO EDUCATION EDUCATION EDUCATION OUTREACH WITH FUNDING TO DO THAT -- AND I THINK THAT CLIMATE NIGHT EAGLES -- WHAT I REFER TO AS MAYBE A CLIMATE OF SOME TEMPTATIONS -- AND SOME DOORS THAT YOU COULD PROBABLY OPEN AND TAKE ADVANTAGE OF OF A NUMBER OF THOSE THOSE -- AVENUES -- AND THAT SAID I THINK BECAUSE THOSE EXISTED -- I THINK THE MEMBERS AT THE TIME AND I'M NOT HERE REALLY TO TO INDICT ANYONE OR SPEAK TO WHAT THEIR MOTIVES ARE IT JUST WAS A CLIMATE OF OF OF OF THEIR DUTIES -- AND SOME OF THOSE FUNCTIONS THAT -- I THINK THEY FELT LIKE THEY WERE SERVING THE TAXPAYERS AND DOING IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE TAXPAYERS BUT I THINK IT DID CREATE -- SOME SCENARIOS AND I THINK WE'VE HEARD THIS IN PREVIOUS HEARINGS I'VE TESTIFIED AT WHERE YOU KNOW THEIR NUMBER OF EXECUTIVES IN CA SAID FELT LIKE YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO COUNT THE VOTES ECCENTRICITY OF HER ALL THAT AND I HEAR. TO REWIND TO THAT TO THAT STORYABOUT TIME. BUT THAT WAS THE CLIMATE AT THE TIME AND SO I CHALLENGING ISSUES THAT THEY SAW SOME IMPROPRIETIES THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN -- A LEVEL OF DISCOMFORT TO RESPOND TO THAT. BUT THE CURRENT ORGANIZATION THE THAT THAT TAXPAYERS TRANSPARENCY ACT HAS RESOLVED MUSCLES ISSUES FIRST AND FOREMOST SO THEY CAN THEY NO LONGER HAVE THE INVESTIGATORY ROLES RESPONSIBILITIES. THEY DO HAVE THE ADJUDICATORY RESPONSIBILITIES AND THAT IS -- GIVING THEM THAT THAT THE AUTHORITY TO HEAR -- OUR APPEALS CASES -- FOR STATUS AS SEES EXCEPT -- FOR AND THE LEGISLATION ALSO IF YOU WANT TO LEGISLATION ALSO ADDRESSED -- THE BOARD'S ROLE. TO AN AUTHORITY TO WORK WITH THEIR EMPLOYEES -- SPECIFICALLY THE BOARD MEMBER STAFF -- AND WHILE I'M ONE OF THEIR EMPLOYEES FOR FOUR OF THE FIVE THEN THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR'S RESPONSIBILITY IS TO RUN THE DAY TO DAY OPERATIONS AND SOUL THAT LEGISLATION SPEAKS TO THE BOARDS -- LIMITATION AND BEING ABLE TO GO INSIDE THE AGENCY I THINK IT'S REALLY THAT'S THAT'S THE MOST SIGNIFICANT THING -- AND I THINK AS A RESULT THE STAFFER FEELING MORE COMFORTABLE THAT THEY CAN JUST YOU KNOW -- THEY CAN JUST OPERATE THE AGENCY AND USE THEIR EXPERTISE. THANK YOU YEAH AND I APPRECIATE THE CANDOR IS WELL. LET'S TALK ABOUT THE REORGANIZATION SHIFT RESPONSIBILITIES. THE SAME QUESTION THAT WE ASKED THE CONTROLLER. IS AN INDEPENDENTLY ELECTED. BE A WE STILL NECESSARY IN CALIFORNIA I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU HAD SAID MADAM CHAIR IF YOU CAN JUST. DO A BIT OF A DEEPER DIVE SAME QUESTION AS WE AS A CONTROLLER -- MAJORITY RESPONSIBILITIES ARE NOW ANOTHER AGENCY -- AND IT'S NOW FOCUS ON SOME PRIMARY -- BUSINESS SECTORS AS WELL AS WORKING WITH ASSESSORS IDEALLY BASIS SO TELL US WINE INTENTLY ELECTED BOARD IS STILL NECESSARY I THINK IT YES I I RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE I THINK IT INDEPENDENTLY ELECTED. ANYTHING IS STILL RELEVANT IN A DEMOCRACY I THINK THAT IN ORDER TO SOLVE PROBLEMS WE DON'T NEED LESS DEMOCRACY YOU NEED MORE DEMOCRACY. AND I'M CONCERNED WHEN THINGS ARE PLACED IN A BUREAUCRATIC STRUCTURE THAT SUNSHINE WON'T GET IN TRANSPARENCY WILL BE SQUELCHED AND ASSESS ABILITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY WILL NOT BE ADEQUATELY -- ADMINISTERED. AM I THINK ABOUT THIS I THINK ABOUT JUST THE CURRENT STATE OF WHERE WE ARE PARTICULARLY SENATOR IN YOUR DISTRICT MET THE THE FIRES THAT HAVE RAVAGED. NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AND PARTS OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND THINKING ABOUT THE FLOODS THAT THAT WE ARE NOW ALL GRAPPLING WITH QUITE HONESTLY THIS ALL SQUARELY HAS TO DO WITH PROPERTY TAXES NOW. THE DISCUSSIONS EARLIER AGAIN WORK FOCUSED AND CENTERED ON SALES AND USE TAX AND I THINK IT'S A LITTLE BIT OF A MISNOMER TO SAY -- THAT THERE'S NOTHING LEFT. YES I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE ROLE HAS BEEN REDUCED BUT THERE IS STILL A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF WORK QUITE FRANKLY TECHNICAL WORK. AS YOU HEARD IN THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR'S REMARKS I DON'T KNOW IF YOU REALIZE THIS BUT FIVE POINT SEVEN TRILLION DOLLARS. OF PROPERTY IS ASSESSED IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT'S A LOT OF PROPERTY THAT NEEDS ASSESSMENTTHAT'S A LOT OF WORKING. HAND IN HAND WITH PROPERTY ASSESSORS. NOW -- I BELIEVE THAT -- WITH THE REALITY OF THE FLOODS AND THE FIRES THAT ASSESSORS HAVE FIND THEMSELVES -- I WOULD IMAGINE UNDER RESOURCE UNDERSTAFFED I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW THIS BUT THE APPRAISAL BUSINESS IS ALMOST A DYING BUSINESS WE NEED. TO THINK CREATIVELY DEVELOP RELATIONSHIPS WITH INSTITUTIONS OF EDUCATION AND APPEAL TO A NEW GENERATION SO THEY WILL BE ABLE TO GOING TO CONTINUE TO FILL THE PIPELINE OF TALENT. AND OUR JOB AS THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION IS TO WORK DIRECTLY WITH THE SS IS ENSURING THAT THEY HAVE THE RESOURCES BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY THAT THEY HAVE THE RULES THE REGULATIONS -- SURVEYS THERE ARE THINGS THAT WE AS A BODY PROVIDE OVERSIGHT AND GUIDANCE AND TOOLS TO TO ALLOW THEM TO HAVE A SYSTEM AND DOING IN DOING THEIR BUSINESS. THE ASSESSMENT OF FIVE POINT SEVEN TRILLION DOLLARS BRINGS IN SIXTY THREE BILLION DOLLARS INTO THE GENERAL FUND. THAT WE USED TO PAY OUR FIRST RESPONDERS TO PAY OUR EDUCATORS AND SO THERE IS A STRONG AND I THINK OF CONVINCING CORRELATION THAT THERE IS CERTAINLY IS A REASON TO CONTINUE TO ALLOW AN ELECTED BODY. NOW LET ME GIVE YOU ANOTHER EXAMPLE NOW AS I MENTIONED I JUST GOT INTO OFFICE -- WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF TAX SEASON AT THIS TIME. AND PEOPLE HAVE QUESTIONS SMALL BUSINESSES STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND AND THEY'RE STILL CALLING MY OFFICE AND I WAS A BIT THE OFFICES OF MY COLLEAGUES. ASKING QUESTIONS NOW WHAT DOES HAPPEN POST AB ONE OH TWO IS THAT WE ARE NO LONGER A ONE STOP SHOP WE NEED TO SIT DIRECT PEOPLE TO DIFFERENT LOCATIONS AND QUITE FRANKLY I'M IN A POSITION. TO HAVING TO DIRECT PEOPLE TO AN EIGHT HUNDRED NUMBER -- AND TO HELP THEM WITH THEIR TAXES THE BUSINESS TAX QUESTIONS -- IN ALAMEDA COUNTY AND WORKING WITH THE NONPROFIT. A CHURCH ORGANIZATION HAD QUESTIONS WHEN WORKING WITH LONG LONG WAS OUR SENSOR IN ALAMEDA COUNTY -- IN IN YOUR COUNTY THERE'S A BUSINESS THAT -- IT BURNED AND GLENN IT'S SELLING THEIR PROPERTY SUCH AS REAL TIME EXAMPLES OF HOW WE HAVE A DAY TO DAY FUNCTION PEOPLE STILL COME TO THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION THEY'RE STILL CALLING US. AND NO MATTER WHERE I GO. PEOPLE -- YOU KNOW HAVE HAVE QUIT STILL HAVE TAX COLLECTION AND TAX QUESTIONS THAT ARE ASKING I WAS AT A A CRAB FEED LAST FRIDAY AND PEOPLE WERE COMING UP TO ME ASKING ME. ABOUT IT ASKING FOR HELP AND ASSISTANCE SO AS WE CONTINUE TO MOVE AND FIGURE OUT WHO'S GOING TO DO WHAT THE REALITY IS IS THAT THIS IS STILL VERY MUCH A SPACE THAT IS OCCUPIED. AND AND RELEVANT TO EVERYDAY PEOPLE AND AS YOU WAS ELECTED OFFICIALS BEGAN TO THINK ABOUT THE FUTURE CHECK IN WITH YOUR CONSTITUENTS ASK YOUR SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS ASK YOUR PROPERTY OWNERS WHAT DO THEY THINK THIS IS THE SOMETHING THAT TO THE CONVERSATION THAT WILL HAVE. A RIPPLE EFFECT ACROSS THE ENTIRE STATE AND THAT IT DESERVES ATTENTION I WILL NOTE THAT ONE ONE VOICE THAT IS MISSING IN THIS HEARING IS LABOR WHERE WHERE WOULD IT WHAT IS THEIR PERSPECTIVE I HAVE. HAVE REACHED OUT AND WOULD LOVE TO GET HERE -- HOPEFULLY YOU'LL BE ABLE TO GET INTO -- WHAT WORKERS ARE SAYING TO THEM ABOUT THE WORK ENVIRONMENT -- TO TALK TO A LITTLE BIT MORE TO ADD SOME MORE CONTEXT AND SOME FRANKLY. QUANTITATIVE POINTS IS THAT THERE ARE FORTY SIX VACANCIES IN THE PO WE AGENCY FORTY SIX TWENTY OF WHICH THAT ARE IN THE PIPELINE AND A HANDFUL OF THAT TWENTY HAVE BEEN IN THE PIPELINE. FOR SIX MONTHS. SIX MONTHS SO YOU WANT ME TO DO MY JOB I PERFORM I'M PERFECTLY WILLING AND READY TO DO IT -- I'M COMMITTED TO SERVE TWENTY FOUR SEVEN I BELIEVE I LEAD A LIFE OF SERVICE THAT'S MY CALLING -- BUT I NEED AN AGENCY THAT HAS THE RESOURCES TO DO WHAT THEY CAN DO SO THAT I CAN SO THAT WE CAN WORK TOGETHER -- IN ASSISTING THE SUPPORT THAT IS NEEDED TO NOT ONLY TAXPAYERS WITH TO THE ASSESSORS. YES. AND YOU'RE JUST GOING BACK AND FORTH A LITTLE BIT ON THAT I I THINK THAT -- TALK ABOUT THE ISSUE OF OF DEMOCRACY IN HAVING THE INDEPENDENTLY ELECTED BOARD. THAT WOULD IMPLY THAT DAY IN OTHER AGENCIES THAT ARE NOW. I DO WHEN THE JOB THAT BE -- WE WANT STATE THAT DOES THAT MEAN THAT. TAXPAYERS ARE GETTING THAT FAIR SHAKE. THAT'S A REALLY GOOD QUESTION I CAN'T SAY WITH ANY DEFINITIVE BECAUSE IT'S ONLY BEEN TWENTY MONTHS RIGHT IT'S I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT QUESTION I WILL DEFINITELY BE ATTENDING THE THE HEARING WITH CITY TFA AND TA. I CAN TELL YOU WHAT I HAVE RECEIVED FROM REPORTS I THINK THEY'RE IMPORTANT -- NUMBERS THAT WE SHOULD CALL AND SINCE SINCE -- SEPTEMBER OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN OF THIS IS I'M QUOTING THE SACRAMENTO BEE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN CASES -- HAVE BEEN DECIDED BY AU TA ALL BUT TO HAVE BEEN IN FAVOR OF THE STATE ALL BUT TWO SO THAT MEANS THAT THE THREE HUNDRED THERE'S A THREE HUNDRED SALES. TAX CASE BACKLOG NO I DON'T NO LONGER HAD TE PURVIEW OF SALES TAX SO I DON'T WANT. TO SPEAK OUT OF TURN BUT I'VE BEEN USING THIS AS JUST SOME COLOR -- TO TO HIGHLIGHT YOUR YOUR QUESTIONING I I LEAVE THAT IS VERY IT'S TOO EARLY TO TELL AND THE PROCESS THAT USUALLY THE LEGISLATURE TAKES. OMINOUS TAKING PRIDE IN IS IS THAT THEY HAVE SWEEPING CHANGES AND THEN THERE'S AN ASSESSMENT THERE'S AN AUDIT THERE'S A DISCUSSION THERE IS. A HEARING -- AT WHERE THERE'S PUBLIC COMMENT IS TAKEN I THINK THAT THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING AS WE CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD. QUITE HONESTLY I THINK IT'S A LITTLE BIT PREMATURE I UNDERSTAND IT THERE'S AN URGENCY AS WE GO INTO THE THE BUDGET DISCUSSION -- WIN AND WE ANTICIPATE THE GOVERNOR'S MATT REV REVISED -- I AM VERY KEENLY AWARE OF HOW THE BUDGET PROCESS WORKS IS BEING FORMER CHAIR OF THE BUDGET ON THE CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO. BUT WE ARE AN ENTITY THAT IS JANUARY VALUE THAT WE ARE BRINGING -- TO TO THE TO THIS TO THE GREAT THEY ALSO WANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT WE STILL ARE WORKING IN CONJUNCTION WITH -- TA AND CD TFA -- IN THE ADMIN THEY THEY ADMINISTER -- AND COLLECTED WE HEAR THE APPEALS SO THERE ISN'T A RELAY THERE IS OF THE RELATIONSHIP IS NOT DIVORCED AND TOTALLY SILO IN SEPARATE FROM EACH OTHER WE STILL HAVE -- AN OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE TO WORK TOGETHER. THANK YOU AND YOUR I. I'M GONNA HAVE A FEW MORE QUESTIONS AND ASKED ONE LAST ONE AND THEN TURN IT BACK OVER TO THE COMMITTEE THEN I'LL JUMP BACK IF THAT WORKS FOR THE COMMITTEE. WE ASKED THE SAME QUESTION OF CONTROLLER II. IN REGARDS TO MEMBER COMPENSATION [inaudible] SO BOB. OPTIONALLY 9095% OF THE RESPONSIBILITY HAS BEEN SHIFTED. OVER TO TO OTHER AGENCIES THAT WERE ONCE UNDER THE UMBRELLA OF THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION -- IS IT AN APPROPRIATE. SALARY NOW THAT THE VAST MAJORITY RESPONSIBILITIES HAVE BEEN SHIFTED. SHOULD WE BE LOOKING AT OTHER OPTIONS LIKE COMPENSATION ON A PER MEETING BASIS AGAIN THERE'S AN INDEPENDENT COMMISSION THAT'S GOING TO SET THIS. BUT NO THAT THAT'S A DISCUSSION AND A LOT OF FOLKS ARE HAVING THE LEGISLATURE THIS YEAR WANTED YOU TO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE ADDRESS IT HEAD ON THANK YOU FOR THAT AND I PROBABLY AM GOING TO ALSO ANSWER THE SAME WAY I MEAN WE'VE GOT PEOPLE. THE CITIZENS COMPOSITION COMMISSION THAT THAT THAT ARE CHARGED TO DEAL WITH THAT THAT'S NOT FOR ME TO DECIDE I MEAN IT MANY WAYS YOU'RE ASKING ME TO BE THE JUDGE AND THE JURY. I I'M NOT GOING TO TO DO THAT BUT ONE THING THAT DOES KIND OF CONCERN ME A LITTLE BIT IS IN JUST KIND OF LIKE THE PHRASING OF IT 9095% OF YOUR DUTIES OF IT HAVE I'VE CHANGED I DON'T NECESSARILY KNOW. IF THAT'S AN ACCURATE -- KWAN OF QUANTIFYING FOR STATES WHAT EXACTLY OUR OUR OUR ROLE IS THE LARGE THE WHAT WAS SEXY AND GLAMOROUS QUITE FRANKLY. THERE'S NOTHING SEXIER ABOUT PROPERTY TAXES I'M TRYING TO MAKE IT EXCITING AGAIN BUT WHAT. WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT WAS WHAT WAS WHAT WAS WELL MAYBE THE ASSESSORS MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING SOMETHING TO DIFFER ON ON ON THAT IN IN THE IN THE ATTACKS HERE ADVOCATES BUT? THE REALITY IS IS THAT SALES AND USE TAX WAS EASY TO UNDERPRIVILEGED UNDERSTAND THEREFORE THEY GRASP ON IT THE MEDIA GRAPHS ON IT AND THEY SAY THAT -- THIS IS WHAT'S GOING WRONG IN THIS IS ODD -- ONE OF THE AUDIENCE OF THE SENATOR IT ONE OF THE ITEMS SAID THAT THEY WERE SOMETHING LIKE. SEVERAL MILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT WERE MISSING OR UNACCOUNTED FOR AND THAT IS TRUE AND THAT WAS IN SALES AND USE TAX I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU UNDERSTAND THAT OUR CORE FUNCTION IN OUR CORE FUNCTION IN OUR BUSINESS. THERE'S NEVER BEEN A DISPUTE WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO COUNT EVERY SINGLE DOLLAR WHEN IT COMES TO PROPERTY TAX ASSESSMENT AND SINCE THAT IS THE PURVIEW CONSTITUTIONALLY GIVEN TO THE STATE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION I WANT TO STAND UP AND DEFEND THAT. AND MAKE SURE THAT THAT REMAINS INTACT THE BE A WEEK IS NOT SOLELY ITS REPUTATION WHEN IT COMES TO THE MAIN CORE CONSTITUTIONAL FUNCTION. IN IN WHERE THE 9295% CAME FROM IS THAT -- THE GOVERNOR THE LEGISLATURE -- TRANSITIONED RESPONSIBILITIES MINUS WHAT IS MANDATED IN THE CONSTITUTION. IN THE AGENCY WENT FROM APPROXIMATELY FORTY TWO HUNDRED TO JUST UNDER TWO HUNDRED EMPLOYEES -- AND SO THAT'S WHERE THAT THE PERCENTAGE CAME FROM AND I THINK EVENTUALLY. IS GOING TO HAVE TO BE SOME TYPE OF DISCUSSION -- ABOUT ROLES RESPONSIBILITIES AND COMPENSATION UNDERSTAND I BOTH THE CONTROL YOURSELF DON'T HAVE THAT TODAY BUT LOOK IN ANY OTHER POSITION JUST BEING CNDID ABOUT IT ANY OTHER POSITION. WHEN THE VAST MAJORITY RESPONSIBILITIES ARE SHIFTED THERE IS GOING TO BE SOME TYPE OF SHIFT THE COMPENSATION? THAT WOULD FOLLOW WAS IT WHAT'S INTERESTING IS IS THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THE SHIFTING OF THE OF OF THE WORKLOAD BUT WE HAVEN'T GIVEN ANY VOICE OR EVEN CONSIDERATION. TO THAT IDEA THAT CENTER GAL JOHNNY PROPOSED ABOUT THAT MOVE WHAT THAT EXACTLY IS GOING TO LOOK FORWARD TO MEETING YOU SEEMS TO BE A CERTAIN -- ALMOST BIAS THAT EXISTS OF BECAUSE THE WORKLOAD ARE EQUATING. WORK LOAD WITH RELEVANCE -- AND THE I I WOULD SUBMIT THAT THE LEVEL OF WORK WHEN IT COMES TO THE STATE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION SCORE FUNCTION. OF OF OF OF OF A PROPERTY TAX -- WHAT IS WHAT ELSE IS THERE'S JUST A THERE'S TOBACCO TAX I'M NOT TOBACCO TAX THERE'S ALCOHOL TAX? AS WELL -- AND SOME INSURERS AND TAX ON INSURERS I MEAN THERE ARE THREE THINGS I MEAN NO NO ONE TALKS ABOUT THAT IT'S NOT AS GLAMOROUS BUT AT THAT STILL OF A FUNCTION. AND AND IF YOU'RE GOING TO SAY WELL YOU'RE YOU NO LONGER DESERVE YOUR SALARY BECAUSE YOU WERE HAD FORTY HEARINGS AND NOW YOU DON'T HAVE FORTY HEARINGS I MEAN THEY DO YOU IT'S REALLY ABOUT THE QUALITY OF WORK NOT NECESSARILY THE QUANTITY. OF WORK THE QUALITY OF WORK IS STILL BEING DONE THE ADVOCACY AND THE REPRESENTATION IS STILL BEING DONE THE APPEALS ARE STILL BEING HEARD AND AND I ALSO JUST WANT TO NOTE AND THAT -- T. EIGHT WEBSITE SHOWS THAT TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN OF OPINION OPINIONS HAVE HAVE BEEN HAVE BEEN WRITTEN IN THAT THERE IS A BACK LEVEL WITH AARON MAYBE. MAYBE YOU WOULD LIKE TO GIVE US LET US HELP OUT GIVE US A LITTLE SOMETHING BACK WE CAN HELP WITH THE BACK LOVE TO HELP THE END OF THE ORGANIZATION. STAND UP THE ORGANIZATION BY JUST WANT TO BE REALLY CAUTIOUS AND THOUGHTFUL THAT THE NUMBER OF HOURS THAT YOU POUR INTO SOMETHING DOES NOT -- VALIDATE YOUR EXISTENCE. ALL YOUR RELEVANCY NO THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR -- ALL HIT THE PAUSE BUTTON LIKE TO BE ABLE TO OPEN IT UP TO OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE -- FOR ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS I HAVE A JUST A FEW MORE -- BUT I WOULD LIKE. TO PASS MYSELF. AND YOUR THANK YOU VERY MUCH TERROR OF I'M SORRY I'M MISTER -- BEGINNING OF YOUR YOUR PRESENTATION BUT IF YOU COULD SUM UP -- WHAT'S WHAT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO KNOW. WHEN EVALUATING THE CURRENT STATE OF THE BOP? I HIGHLIGHT WHAT ARE THOSE. KEY THINGS THAT WE NEED TO KNOW AS WE MOVE FORWARD AND EVALUATING THE BOP. WELL I THINK -- SENATOR WELCOME BACK AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR THOUGHTFUL QUESTIONS COUPLE THINGS THAT I WILL HIGHLIGHT ON FIRST -- DEMONSTRATING A COLLEGIAL WORK ENVIRONMENT. THAT THE CULTURE [inaudible] OF THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION THE BOARD HAS CHANED. AND YOU COMING FROM A BACKGROUND DEEP WITH LABOR YOU KNOW HOW CULTURAL CHANGES ARE CHALLENGING. TO TO TO TO TO CORRECT WE CHANGE THAT -- WE'VE DISTANT DID THAT DEMONSTRATE A COLLEGIAL WORKING ENVIRONMENT. I BELIEVE THAT TAXPAYERS NEED AND DESERVE REPRESENTATION I BELIEVE THAT IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN A DEMOCRACY YOU NEED MORE DEMOCRACY NOT LESS. IF THERE ARE CHALLENGES WE ADDRESS THEM STRAIGHT ON I BELIEVE THAT -- THAT THERE IS A A A A THE IS. THAT THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION IS NO LONGER RELEVANT AND I THROW BACK. THAT'S FIVE POINT SEVEN TRILLION DOLLARS OF PROPERTY IS ASSESSED AND AGAIN THAT'S OUR CORE FUNCTION THAT CREEK THAT BEEN DISSEMINATED THAT'D BEN IS COLLECTED AND BRINGS IN SIXTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS. EXCUSE ME SIXTY FOUR BILLION DOLLARS INTO THE GENERAL FUND I ATE ICE HIGHLIGHT THE FACT THAT -- IN THIS DAY AND AGE WHERE WE HAVE RAVAGED CALIFORNIAN FLOODS THAT ARE RAVAGING CALIFORNIA THAT THE ASSESSORS NEEDS CONTINUED SUPPORT FROM THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION AND THAT HIS STREAK SQUARELY HAS TO DO WITH OUR ROLE. ON A PROPERTY TAX ASSESSMENT I GAVE EXAMPLES OF NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS THAT WE ARE WORKING ON BEHALF AND ON THE GROUND WITH WE ARE ASSESSABLE THEY'RE COMING TO US IN. WALGREENS QUITE FRANKLY IN DIFFERENT PARTS MUCH LIKE HOW YOU ARE A SENSIBLE TO YOUR CONSTITUENTS AND I BELIEVE THAT -- IN A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY WE SHOULD BE SUPPORTING AND UPS AND STANDING UP ORGANIZATIONS WHERE PEOPLE ARE ELECTED TO SERVE I GAVE EXAMPLES OF THE CPUC IS DEALING WITH THE PUBLIC UTILITIES A PUBLIC UTILITIES COMPANY. THAT IS IN THE MIDST OF BANKRUPTCY -- AND THEY HAVE HAD DID CORRUPTION -- ALLEGATIONS INC RECONSTITUTED THAT THAT BOARD A I BELIEVE THAT ELECTED OFFICIALS COME TO THIS BODY A COME TO THEIR SERVICE WITH A HIGHER STANDARD AND HAVE INTEGRITY I BELIEVE THAT WHEN ELECTIVES ARE ACTING POORLY THAT THERE IS A WAY TO ADDRESS. THEIR GRIEVANCES AND ADDRESS THEIR THEIR THEIR BEHAVIOR HI RIGHT I'VE SAID THAT THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT IN A HUNDRED AND FORTY YEAR HISTORY THAT YOU REALLY HAVE DIVERSITY AT FORT HERE YOU'VE GOT THE FIRST ELECTED BLACK WOMAN THE FIRST ELECTED LATINO MEAN. YOU'VE GOT A SENIOR REPRESENTATIVE -- REPRESENTING THE THIS IS REALLY A NEW DAY AND I WAS CONCERNED THAT THE SINS OF THE PREVIOUS CLASS WERE CLOUDING IS A CLOUD OVER OR THE JUDGMENT OF OF OF THIS BODY. WHETHER THERE ARE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC. EDITORIAL BOARDS OR SOME OF YOUR COLLEAGUES -- I WANT TO ALLOW BRENDA FLEMING TO SHARE WITH YOU -- THOROUGHLY UNDERSTOOD ALL OF THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION NOW THAT AB ONE OH TWO IS. THE LAW OF THE LAND AND IF YOU COULD HIGHLIGHT NOT JUST OUR OUR ON PROPERTY TAX ELEMENT BUT ALSO THE OTHER THE OTHER -- TWO FUNCTIONS THAT WOULD CORE FUNCTIONS THAT WE PERFORM. SO THANK YOU FOR THAT OPPORTUNITY SO AS AS I STATED BEFORE -- A THE THE CORE PORTION OF RESPONSIBILITY IS ON THE PROPERTY TAX PROGRAMS OF COURSE STATE ASSESSING COUNTY SUCH PROGRAMS BUT WE DO HAVE -- THE RENTAL CARS WE TALKED ABOUT ALSO AND THE TAX ON INSURERS AN ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGE -- SO THOSE PROGRAMS ARE SIMPLY SMALLER BUT THEY STILL HAVE WE STILL HAVE -- A WORKLOAD RELATED TO THAT ON JUST FOR THE RECORD WE DO HAVE A AGAIN IN TERMS OF ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTIONS OF THOSE TAX PROGRAMS THEN AGAIN ANOTHER PART OF THE SERVICE THAT WE RELY ON CD TFA TO PERFORM SOME OF THOSE CORE FUNCTIONS. ON BUT WE STILL HAVE A ROLE -- THEY'RE STILL APPEALS ACTIVITIES THEY'RE STILL SEEING A REPORT SOME MATERIALS THAT WE HAVE TO REVIEW SO IT IS A PART OF THE BOARD'S RESPONSIBILITY -- TO STILL HAVE AN ADJUDICATORY -- ROLL AND ROLL MAKING ROLE ON WELL CHAIRMAN COLIN I APPRECIATE YOU EMBARKING ON SUCH A DIFFICULT. VENTURE ADVENTURE HERE MAYBE. BUT IT IS. A STORY THAN IN HSTORIC AGENCY. THE OTHERS. IN THE THROES OF A LOT OF CHANGES NOW. ONE OF THE CHECKS AND BALANCES THAT WE HAVE HERE. IS EFFECTED BY THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES ACT. ONE OF THE ELEMENTS THERE IS THAT THERE ARE STATUTORY FOUNDATION FOR THE THINGS THAT. AN ENTITY WOULD DO THROUGH REGULATION OR DEPARTMENT OPERATION MANUAL OR WHATEVER. MAYBE THIS IS JUST BEEN ALL MINUTIA BUT DO YOU CONTEMPLATE A HALF -- TO HAVE TO REVIEW NOW. YOUR REGULATIONS AND WILL THAT BE DONE THROUGH THE ADMINISTRATIVE. PROCEDURES PROCESS IF YOU ARE GOING TO BE REVIEWING. THE REGULATIONS. ARE THE SHORT ANSWER IS YES -- I WANTED TO PLEASE GO AHEAD IF LIVING FOR LOVE IT MORE THOUGHTFUL OF COURSE. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY -- IN A CHAIR SO -- YES WE DO USE THAT PROCESS SO AS AS RULE MAKING HIS A SIGNIFICANT. PART OF THE BOARD'S RESPONSIBILITY -- THEIR KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERTISE THEIR ABILITY TO SORT OF PULL BACK. AND LOOK AT THINGS HOLISTICALLY -- AS ONE OF THE GREAT VALUES THAT THEY BRING TO THE TABLE IN TERMS OF RULE MAKING REALLY STUDYING THE ISSUES UNDERSTANDING ISSUES CLEARLY STAFFER INVOLVED IN SUPPORT OF BUT IN THAT RULE MAKING PROCESS WE JUST RECENTLY HAD SOME -- ON SOME RECENT ISSUES -- AND FOURTH QUARTER OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND SO WE DO DOCUMENT THAT PROCESS WE GET AND PUT THROUGH -- STAKE HOLDERS THROUGH INTERESTED PARTIES PROCESS -- THE MATERIAL IS THEN PRESENTED TO THE BOARD -- FULL DISCUSSION IF YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO GO BACK AND LOOK AT SOME OF THE HEARINGS OVER THE LAST -- QUARTER FULL DISCUSSIONS AND VERY ACTIVE ROLE THAT THE BOARD PLAY THE BOARD PLAYED A SIGNIFICANT ROLE -- IN WORKING WITH OUR STAKEHOLDERS -- WITH THE THE TASK TAX ADVOCATE THE THE ISSUE IS TO MAKE SURE RULES WERE IN THIS CASE WE DO USE AND WORK WITH THE OFFICE OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW -- TO TO TRANSLATE -- THOSE ROLES AND TO GET THEM CAUGHT BY. THAT AND GET TO THE CHAIR COLIN YOU MENTIONED [inaudible] OPPOSITION. THIRTEEN I'M VERY SENSITIVE ABOUT THAT PARTICULAR ISSUE WHAT DO YOU SEE. PROSPECTIVELY. AS THE BOARD WOULD BE. PROCEEDING RELATED TO PROPOSITION THIRTEEN WELL YOU KNOW THAT'S A VERY INTERESTING POINT I DON'T EVEN THINK OF I DIDN'T EVEN MENTION THAT IN MY CAR IN MY COMMENTS -- BUT AGAIN ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WHEN IT COMES TO ASSESSMENT OF PROPERTY PROP THIRTEEN QUALIFIED IT'S GOING TO THE BALLOT IN TWENTY TWENTY I WOULD SAY IS NOW THE TIME TO GET RID OF YOUR DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED -- THAT BODY -- I WOULD SUBMIT THE ANSWER STILL IS NO PROP THIRTEEN IS. A QUESTION THAT VOTERS ARE GOING TO ASK AND THAT IS THAT QUESTION IS IS ARE WE GOING TO BE A REASSESSING COMMERCIAL PROPERTY THAT FALL SQUARELY IN THE ROLE OF THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION. AND SQUARELY IN THE ROLE OF THE ASSESSORS NOW IF IT PASSES THAT WILL HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON ON ASSESSORS PARTICULARLY SENSORS THAT ARE REPRESENTED IN RURAL COUNTIES WHERE THEY ARE UNDER RESOURCE ALREADY IN THEIR DAILY FUNCTION. AND WE WILL NEED TO WORK COLLECTIVELY TO CREATE -- RULES AND GUIDELINES AND GIVE THEM ASSISTANCE SO THAT THEY CAN COMPLY WITH WHAT THE VOTERS HAVE PUT FORWARD -- LARGER COUNTIES CHANGE AND AND WHAT WHAT WILL BE CONSIDERED OR WAS YOU FOR MISSILE THE EUPHEMISTICALLY DESCRIBED AS A SPLIT ROLE SPLITTING RESIDENTIAL FROM COMMERCIAL PROPERTY IN THAT ASSESSMENT BUT YOU KNOW A IT IS IN THE FUTURE IT IS TO BE DETERMINED. I AM HERE TO MAKE THE CASE THAT NOW IS NOT THE TIME TO BEGIN TO QUESTION WHETHER NOT A DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED BODY SHOULD. SHOULD EXIST OR SHOULD NOT EXIST I THINK THAT THIS IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE THAT FURTHER DRIVES HOME THE POINT THAT WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD AND HAVE A BODY THAT IS NOT LEARNING. BUT HAS A DEMONSTRATED TRACK LAP RECORD FOR OUTSTANDING PROPERTY ASSESSMENT THANK YOU SENATOR NELSON THANK YOU. IT'S AN IMPORTANT SUBJECT GOOD I MIGHT NOTE THAT. THE RURAL AREAS WOULD RATHER VIEW THAT. TO AND NOT THAT THEY'RE UNDER RESOURCE BUT THEY'RE OVERTAXED. AND THAT IS STILL THEIR POINT OF VIEW. I THINK THAT'S STILL THE POINT OF VIEW OF MOST CALIFORNIANS. AND WE WILL REST WITH THAT PERSPECTIVE WELL BUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR COMMENTS THANK YOU SENATOR. THANK YOU MR VICE CHAIR. I HAVE A FEW MORE BUT WOULD LIKE TO BE TO SEE IF WE HAVE ADDITIONAL COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. ALL RIGHT IF IT'S ALRIGHT WITH AT THE COMMITTEE'S WE JUST LIKE THAT I'D TAKE A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME IN REGARDS A FEW MORE QUESTIONS [inaudible] I'M. WE HEARD THE ADVOCACY BY THE CHAIR WOMAN IN REGARDS TO THE BELIEVE THEY NEED -- FOR AN ELECTED BOARD. SO THERE ARE A LOT OF FOLKS IN THE CAPITAL SAYING THAT LOOK STATE AGENCIES. CAN. I TAKE ON THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE DO WHAT THE BILL WE DIES AND A DAILY BASIS WITHOUT AN ELECTED BOARD. WELL I THINK THE QUESTION IS CAN CAN THEY DO IT I'M SURE I MEAN THEY'RE VERY SMART TALENTED PEOPLE BUT THE QUESTION IS IS HOW WELL WILL THEY BE ABLE TO DO IT HOW WELL WILL THEY BE ABLE TO FULLY EXECUTE. DOING WORK THAT WE HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN DOING FOR A HUNDRED AND FORTY YEARS AND I SUBMIT THAT NOBODY WILL BE ABLE TO DO A BETTER THAN AN AGENCY THAT HAS BEEN DOING IT FOR AS LONG AS WE HAVE BEEN DOING IT. OKAY I I THINK THE ONLY. BRING THAT UP IS THAT LOOK AT AGAIN I WANT TO CONTINUE TO SAY AT THE CHAIR WOMAN. THIS CURRENT BOARD HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE SINS OF THE PAST WHO. BUT WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN THE PAST AND I AND I DO BELIEVE THERE STILL CLOUD. AND RIGHTFULLY SO THERE ARE SOME AGREE JUST ACTIONS. JUST. TWO YEARS AGO. WHICH LEAD THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR DO YOU DO BUT THEY DIDN'T TAKE THE ACTION. IN. OUR THERE IS GONNA BE DISCUSSION OF DO WE NEED -- AGAIN I WANT YOU JUST COMMENT IS WE DID DISCUSS PRIOR TO THIS HEARING WANTING TO MAKE SURE THAT. YOU HAVE YOUR TIME IN EACH YOU HAVE YOUR SAY. THAT WORD CAN BE A BOARD OF EXPERTS -- THAT HAS -- BACKGROUND IN WHICH THE SUBJECT MATTER IS ON A DAILY BASIS I YOU COULD CREATE A SERIES OF AN ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGES AS WE'VE SEEN WITH THIS TRANSITION. TO BE ABLE TO DO THE JOB THAT THE BOARD'S DOING NOW. I AND THE STAFF IS STILL ABLE TO DO THE PROFESSIONAL WORK. SO. FORTY NINE OTHER STATES ARE ABLE TO DO IT -- I UNDERSTAND THAT CALIFORNIA'S LARGEST BUT AGAIN I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE WE DRILL DOWN ON THAT ISSUE BEFORE WE LEAVE BECAUSE THAT'S BEEN A LOT OF CONVERSATION IN THE HALLS AROUND HERE IS YOU KNOW. I WANNA GIVE BOTH THE OPPORTUNITY. AND IGN DATES DO WHICH I UNFORTUNATELY DON'T KNOW IF THEY'RE DOING IT WELL THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE DON'T KNOW WE KNOW THAT THEY'RE DOING IT BUT WE HAVE NO ASSESSMENT AS TO WHETHER THEY'RE EXECUTING FULLY. ON AND I WOULD IMAGINE THERE'S PEOPLE THAT GRIPE AND SAY THAT THAT THERE ISN'T THE OTHER THING YOU BRING HOME A REALLY INTERESTING POINT ABOUT. IT SHOULD THE BODY BE ELECTED A SHOULD BE FILLED WITH EXPERTS I I YOU KNOW IT QUITE HONESTLY I WOULD SAY THAT THERE IS NO QUALIFICATION -- IN ORDER TO SERVE ON THE BOARD OF EDUCATION YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE A CERTIFIED CLASSROOM TEACHER TO SERVE ON THE BOARD OF EDUCATION YOU DON'T HAVE TO KNOW HOW TO OPERATE A MUNY BUS OR A LIGHT RAIL. IN ORDER TO SERVE IN ANY OF THE AND THE TRANSPORTATION ENTITIES WHAT I'M SAYING TO YOU IS IS THAT WHAT YOU NEED OUR DEDICATED ELECTED OFFICIALS THAT ARE CONNECTED AND REMEMBER WHO THEY SERVE. AND ARE COMMITTED TO TO A LIFETIME OF SERVICE AND I BELIEVE THAT IF YOU'RE HAVING TROUBLE WITH ANY KIND OF IT. ANY KIND OF AGENCY THAT YOU NEED MORE DEMOCRACY AND NOT LESS YOU NEED MORE TRANSPARENCY WHAT CONCERNS ME IS IF YOU GO INTO THE BUREAUCRATI STRUCTURE IS THAT REALLY -- MEETINGS ARE TELEVISED YOU GET MINUTES YOU DON'T GET TO A TEE YOU GET WHICH IS A SET OF SOMEONE ELSE'S SUMMATION OF WHAT TRANSPIRED IN THE MEAT IN THE MEETINGS AND I THINK THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING THAT IS LOST. AND IN THE IN THE PEOPLE THAT ARE LOSING WILL BE TAX PLAYERS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT EVERY DAY PEOPLE THAT DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES TO HIRE A LOBBYIST AND DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES. TO DO IT TO HIRE A LAWYER TO WALK THE HALLS AN ADVOCATE ON THEIR BEHALF I MEAN THIS YOU'RE TAKING AWAY -- THE THE THE THE THE THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA AS WALLY'S TO HAVE AN ELECTED REPRESENTATIVE WHOM THEY CAN GO TO YOU CAN WALK INTO THE OFFICE YOU CAN SCHEDULE AN APPOINTMENT. AND AND REACH OUT. TO CAN THEY DO IT I YOU KNOW THAT'S TO BE DETERMINED THE REALLY I THINK THE QUESTION IS WILL THEY BE ABLE TO DO IT WELL THE MANAGER. MANAGING DIRECTOR ANY ITEMS -- SO I CAN KERR -- I KNOW THIS FROM MY PERSPECTIVE I DO -- INPUT ON THE HALF AND I'M NOT JUST THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE AGENCY AND REPRESENTING OUR EMPLOYEES AND OUR BOARD -- BUT JUST AS A CITIZEN. THERE'S A DEFINITE VALUE. TO HAVING REPRESENTATIVES THAT THE VOTERS -- SELECTED TO BE THERE TO REPRESENT THEM. MOM AND I WOULD I WOULD LEAVE YOU WITH. THE BOARD HAS A VALUE IS A DIFFERENT THAN IT WAS BEFORE YOU KNOW THE WORKLOAD HAS SHIFTED WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT -- WE LIVE THROUGH IT SO SO THAT'S TRUE. BUT I THINK THAT THE DIFFERENCE THAT I'D LIKE TO MAYBE LEAVE WITH YOU AND MAYBE SORT OF DEMYSTIFYING -- AND SOME OF THE SOME OF THE SOME OF THE SOME OF THINKING OUT THERE AND AND MAYBE CLARIFY. I THINK OUR HISTORICALLY WITHOUT THE PRIOR BOARD THERE WAS A LOT OF WORK LOAD -- AND SELL THE VOLUME SPOKE TO ALL LOOK THE BOARD IS BUSY -- THREE FORTY BOARD MEETINGS VERY LONG DAYS ECCENTRIC CETERA -- THE VOLUME DOESN'T NECESSARILY REPRESENT THE CURRENT B. O. E. THE B. WE KIRBY -- EACH TO DOUBT I'LL DEFINITELY HAS A WORKLOAD -- THAT'S REDUCED FROM WHAT IT WAS BEFORE BUT THE COMPLEXITY OF PROPERTY TAXES WHAT IS SO IMPRESSIVE AN AMAZING. AND IT'S NOT COMPLEX JUST FOR THE SAKE OF BEING COMPLEX IS COMPLEX BECAUSE THE YOU KNOW THE ISSUES OF FOR F. PROPERTY -- THAT THE THE VALUATION PRICE ASSESSMENT AND EVALUATION -- AND REPRESENTING AND SUPPORTING THE STATUS AS SEASON THE COUNTY SAYS HE'S THAT COMPLEXITY IS WHAT THE DIFFERENCE IS SO I DON'T KNOW IF YOU COULD MEASURE IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW THAT SO THAT SAID WITH THAT COMPLEXITY. ON TO THE CHAIR'S POINT WHEN YOU HAVE ELECTED STATE YOU CAN REACH OUT TO TO HELP WITH THE TRANSLATION ARE GRANTED YOU KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS AND PHYLLIS AND I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU KNOW THE STATUS AS THESE ARE LARGE ORGANIZATIONS -- BUT I DO KNOW THAT YOU KNOW THERE ARE TIMES WHEN WE STILL HAVE APPEALS WHEN THEY HAVE THOSE CHALLENGES IT IS NICE TO BE ABLE TO ESCALATE IT TO SOMEONE WHO. COMES FROM A BACKGROUND OF NOT JUST BEING YOU KNOW AND FOR THOSE OF US THAT HAVE BEEN WORKING FOR THE STATE FOR A LONG TIME I GET THAT BUT JUST HAVING SOMEBODY WHO HAS A DIFFERENT BACKGROUND. AS ELECTED TO BRINGS SO MANY OTHER INCREDIBLE TALENTS TO THE TABLE SO I THINK BEING ABLE TO ESCALATE YOU KNOW THROUGH THE APPEALS PROCESS ISSUES THAT COME BEFORE THE BOARD I MEAN THAT. MAY BE DIFFERENT SPEC PERSPECTIVE ON REAL MAKING KINDS OF THINGS I THINK THEY DO BRING KIND OF JUST A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE FROM THAT VERSES. INTERNAL TO THE B. WE WE HAVE STATE EMPLOYEES AND IF WE HAD WE% WRITTEN YOU KNOW ESCALATED TO AN APPEAL PROCESS THAT GOES TO OTHER STATE EMPLOYEES I THINK IT'S KIND OF IT MIGHT BE A BIT ONE DIMENSIONAL EVEN WITH SOME INDEPENDENT BOARDS. IT'S JUST SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT IN TERMS OF THE PERSPECTIVE IN TERMS OF THE RICH BACKGROUNDS THAT ELECTED TO BRING TO THE TABLE. THANK YOU MADAM EXACTLY LIKE MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE. EXACTLY RECTOR AN ADMINISTRATIVE ITEM I LIKE TO JUST BETTER DISCUSS THAT I'D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO ASK ONE FINAL QUESTION REGARDS. TO DAY IN THE LIFE OF A BOARD MEMBER IN THIS -- NEW REALITY IN WHICH YOU ARE LIVING IN NOW. BUT AN ADMINISTRATIVE QUESTION REGARDS OFFICE SPACE SO -- THERE'S BEEN DISCUSSION ABOUT BEER WE MOVING OUT. I I I THINK IN IN THOMAS RIGHT ARM. WHAT'S THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING. DOWNTOWN IF YOU WILL VERSUS. NEW THOMAS SO CAN YOU JUST TALK ABOUT TAX THAT'S BEEN AN ITEM THAT'S BEEN BUBBLING OVER IT HAS BEEN IN THANK YOU FOR THAT OPPORTUNITY IT IS. ONE OF MY TOP PRIORITIES SO JUST PATIENT THAT BINGE THE MAJORITY OF OUR CURRENT BE WE TO AN EMPLOYEES OF AM ARE HAPPEN TO THOMAS LOCATION -- AND SO THEY'VE BEEN THERE FOR QUITE SOME TIME YOU KNOW EVEN WITH B. WE WENT OUT -- THOSE EMPLOYEES WERE THERE -- IT SET UP THAT WAY YOU KNOW TO SUPPORT ITS EASY ACCESS FOR THE COUNTY ASSESSOR'S OF COURSE WE DO TRAINING WE HAVE A NUMBER OF MEETINGS THERE EXCEPT FOR THAT YOU KNOW COUNTY ASSESSOR SERVICE. ARE -- USE THAT AS KIND OF AN EXTENSION IF YOU WILL SOMETIMES OF THEIR OFFICES -- X. -- NOT DAY TODAY BUT JUST IN TERMS OF TRAINING EXCEPT FOR CONFERENCES MEETINGS -- THE THIS IS A SMALLER PERCENTAGE OF THE EMPLOYEES ARE IN THE DOWNTOWN LOCATION SO THE EXECUTIVE OFFICER LEGAL STAFF ARE BORE PROCEEDINGS. THE LAW SAYS NO CREATED THAT BARRIER THAT FIREWALL BETWEEN THE THE ELECTED BOARD AND THE EMPLOYEES. AND SO THE ISSUE OF HAVING THE STAFF MOVED TO ONE SIXTY PROM NIGHT AT THE THOMAS LOCATION IS ACTUALLY NOT A PROBLEM -- THE CONSOLIDATION OF ALL THE EMPLOYEES IN THAT LOCATION ACTUALLY WOULD THERE WERE SOME DEFINITELY SOME EFFICIENCIES THERE. THERE'S GONNA BE SOME ADJUSTMENTS BECAUSE IT'S  SHIFT IN BUSINESS MODEL FOREST BECAUSE AGAIN WE WERE WITH CD TFA AND SO A LOT OF THOSE ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES ARE SO TIGHTLY COUPLED. THAT WILL BE MOVED TO ANOTHER LOCATION WE'VE GOT TO WORK OUT THE LOGISTICS WE CAN DO THAT. I THINK THE GREATER ISSUE IS FOR THE BOARD MEMBER SPECIFICALLY I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THAT BECAUSE IN WORKING WITH YOU KNOW SOME OF THE OTHER AGENCIES I THOUGHT ALL OF THE WE WANTED TO BE IN THE DOWNTOWN CORE DOOR AND IT'S NOT WE'RE LOOKING AT THE STAFFING OKAY. MOVING TUNA THOMAS BUT THE BOARD MEMBERS OFFICIAL TAKE TO MAINTAIN THAT SEPARATION BECAUSE THAT JUST FROM THE OPTICS YOU SEE THAT THE BOARD MEMBERS ARE NOT DIRECTLY -- ENGAGING DAY TODAY WITH THE EMPLOYEES. I THINK THE GREATER THING HOWEVER IS THEIR ROLE -- WHERE WE FIND THE VALUE OF THE BOARD AND AND ONE OF THE OTHER LANES IS THEIR ADVOCACY SOMETIMES AND IN THIS CASE FOR THINGS THAT THE AGENCY IS FIGHTING? FOR AND SO I THINK AS YOUR COLLEAGUES -- CONSTITUTIONAL OFFICERS IN YOUR COLLEAGUES I THINK THE CLOSE PROXIMITY CONSISTENT WITH OTHER -- ELECTED -- AND CONSTITUTIONAL OFFICERS ARM ALL ARE DOWN INTO THE DOWNTOWN LOCATION SO I THINK TO THE EXTENT IF I COULD USE FOR THIS ANALOGY IF YOU COME TO THE CONSTITUTIONAL OFFICER ON TABLE IF YOU WILL -- HAVING A MATTE CLOSE PROXIMITY TO BE A PART OF THE STATE WIDE POLICY SETTING NOW STATEWIDE DISCUSSIONS ON SIGNIFICANT ISSUE PROPERTY TAX AND BE TAXING TAKES THAT TAXATION BEING ONE OF THEM. I THINK THE CLOSE PROXIMITY -- AND BEING ABLE TO HAVE EASY ACCESS TO MANY OF THE STAKE HOLDERS THAT ARE VISITING YOUR OFFICES COME TO THE TO TO THE BOARD'S OFFICES EXCEPT FOR WOULD BE EXTREMELY HELPFUL. I'M SO I THINK THAT AND JUST BASED UPON THE NATURE OF THE WORK THAT WE'RE SEEING -- I THINK IT'S IT'S A FREE GENERAL PROXIMITY AND OBSCENITY AS AS AS THEIR COLLEAGUES ARE. EXCEPTIONAL. NO THANK YOU SO MUCH AND I THINK IT'S GONNA BE A I WON'T GO ANY DEEPER DIVE WITH THAT BECAUSE I KNOW THAT A MAN OF MY CHAIR WILL HAVE SOME DISCUSSIONS ON THAT AS WELL AND ON THE ISSUE OF AIDID'S YES [inaudible] I AM. BUT I'M SURE I'D LIKE TO BE ABLE JUST A FINISH UP HI THEN I ASKED FOR CLOSING COMMENTS UP FROM. OTHER COMMITTEES IN THE CLOSING COMING FROM YOU MADAM CHAIR SO LOOK TRANSITIONS HAPPEN WERE TWENTY ONE ST -- LESS OF A WORKLOAD AND THEIR WIVES SO AGAIN.

THE BEER WE ON A DAILY BASIS AND WE LIKE EACH OF THE FOUR TO BE TO COME FORWARD WE HAVE THE CALAVERAS COUNTY ASSESSOR LESLIE DAVIS -- ALSO SHE IS THE PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSESSORS ASSOCIATION. THE RETIRED MARINE COUNTY ASSESSOR SARICH BENSON IS HERE WE HAVE TREES TO MAY -- WHO IS REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION AND WE'RE ALSO GRATEFUL THAT SAMANTHA CORBIN FROM THE CALIFORNIA TAX REFORM ASSOCIATION HERE IS HERE WITH US TODAY? THE FORMAT OF THIS LAST PANEL IS GOING TO BE FIVE NO MORE THAN SEVEN MINUTES FOR EACH INDIVIDUAL WE WILL THEN OPEN IT UP FOR PUBLIC COMMENT WE APPRECIATE ALL OF YOU. HANGING WITH US HERE TODAY ON THIS IMPORTANT HEARING WE'RE NOW GOING TO TURN IT OVER TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA SUCH DECISION MISTAKE THIS MISTAKE THIS WELCOME THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME YEAH. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU FOR INVITING US HERE TODAY. THE CALIFORNIA ASSESSORS ASSOCIATION IS A STATEWIDE PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATION. OF COUNTY ASSESSOR'S THAT WAS CREATED IN. NINETEEN OH TWO OUR EARLIEST HISTORICAL RECORD SHOW THAT ONE OF CAA'S PRIMARY PURPOSES IS TO WORK COLLABORATIVELY WITH THE BE -- WE CAME TO MIND AT SCHOOL IN THE MIKE A LITTLE CLOSER I APOLOGIZE. I AM SO SORRY FOR YOUR WEIGHT RICHARD. THAT'S GREAT OKAY. THAT CONTINUES ASSESSORS HAVE A UNIQUE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION. THE BOP PROVIDES CRITICAL REVIEWS SUPPORT AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO THE INDEPENDENTLY ELECTED COUNTY ASSESSOR'S IN EACH OF CALIFORNIA'S FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES. I'LL CALL YOUR ATTENTION TO OUR WHITE PAPER ON THE STATE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION BUT THE DESCRIPTION OF THOSE AREAS THAT ARE MOST IMPORTANT FOCUS MY COMMENTS IF I MAY. ON THE AREA IS REQUESTED BY THE CHAIR THAT WHITE PAPER WAS DISTRIBUTED TO EACH OF THE COMMITTEES AS WELL SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU STATE LAW REQUIRES THAT WE WORK TOGETHER IN SEVERAL AREAS INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO APPRAISER AND ASSESSMENT ANALYST CERTIFICATION. AND DEVELOPING STANDARDIZED FORMS WE CO ADMINISTER WELFARE EXEMPTIONS AND WE'VE EXPANDED OUR COLLABORATION INTO OTHER AREAS THAT INCLUDE TRAINING AND OUR COUNTY SURVEYS. IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT IN GENERAL OUR EXPERIENCE WITH THE BOP HAS BEEN GOOD. WE'VE HAD SOME ROUGH PATCHES OF COURSE ELECTIONS CHANGE THE MAKEUP OF OUR ORGANIZATION JUST AS THEY CHANGE THE BOARD. IN THE END WE'RE ALL WORKING FOR THE TAXPAYERS OF CALIFORNIA AND I BELIEVE THAT'S THE GREATEST STRENGTH OF THE BOARD WHEN THEY KEEP THAT FOCUS. THE BIGGEST CRITICISM I'VE HEARD OF THE BOARD IS THAT MEMBERS SOMETIMES ACT AS IF THEY'RE BEHOLDEN TO SPECIAL INTERESTS. THAT HELP FUND THEIR LAST OR THEIR NEXT CAMPAIGN. HOWEVER I'VE HEARD THAT CRITICISM OF OTHER ELECTED OFFICIALS AND I'M REMINDED OF THE OLD ADAGE THAT WHEN YOU'RE POINTING YOUR FINGER AT SOMEONE. THREE FINGERS ARE POINTING BACK AT YOU. THE FACT THAT CALIFORNIA IS UNIQUE IN THE NATION WITH AN ELECTED BOARD RESPONSIBLE FOR ADMINISTERING PROPERTY TAX LAW. DOES NOT INHERENTLY CREATE PROBLEMS OR MAKE IT BETTER OR WORSE AT PERFORMING ITS TASKS. THE EFFECTIVE ADMINISTRATION OF PROPERTY TAX LAW HAS A DIRECT IMPACT ON TAXPAYERS AND NON GOVERNMENTAL FUNCTIONS. IT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED A PRIORITY BY THE STATE. FROM A PUBLIC POLICY STANDPOINT TAXPAYERS AND VOTERS HAVE THE RIGHT TO EXPECT ACCOUNTABILITY. AND FOR THE MOST PART THEY GET THAT WHEN THEY CHOOSE THEIR REPRESENTATIVES. THE CALIFORNIA ASSESSORS ASSOCIATION FEELS VERY STRONGLY THAT THE BEER WE USE MOST IMPORTANT FUNCTION AS AN ASSESSMENT AGENCY. REQUIRES A VASTLY DIFFERENT SKILL SET THAN A TAX AGENCY. ATTACKS AGENCY IS CONCERNED AN ACCOUNTING. AND ASSESSMENT AGENCY IS CONCERNED WITH FAIR EQUITABLE STANDARDIZED IN UNIFORM ASSESSMENT PRACTICES. THE TEARS QUESTION COMPARING THE BOP TO AN ASSESSMENT APPEALS BOARD WOULD TAKE MORE THAN FIVE MINUTES TO DISCUSS. AND IN MANY WAYS IT'S LIKE COMPARING APPLES TO ORANGES. AND ASSESSMENT APPEALS BOARD IS ACQUIRES I JUDICIAL BODY WHOSE ONLY FUNCTION IS TO ADJUDICATE A DISPUTE BETWEEN A TAXPAYER AND THE ASSESSOR'S OFFICE. THAT DECISION AFFECTS ONE VALUE% ON ONE ASSESSMENT ROLL. THE VIDEO IS RESPONSIBILITY IS OVERSIGHT STANDARDIZATION AND GUIDANCE ON LOCAL ASSESSMENT PRACTICES. BAD HAS STATE WIDE RAMIFICATIONS. THE QUESTION OF MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS IS ONE AREA WHERE CA MEMBERS DO NOT HAVE AGREEMENT. LIKE YOU. MEMBERS OF THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION OTHER STATE CONSTITUTIONAL OFFICERS AND EVEN ASSESSORS. NEED ONLY BE EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD REGISTERED TO VOTE IN ORDER TO HOLD OFFICE. IT IS UP TO THE VOTERS TO DECIDE. WHO WILL ACT IN THEIR BEST INTEREST? I THINK WE CAN AGREE ON TRAINING IT'S A GOOD THING. AND I'M ENCOURAGED BY THE FACT THAT THE NEWLY ELECTED BOARD MEMBERS HAVE ENGAGED IN TRAINING ACTIVITIES AT THEIR FIRST TWO BOARD MEETINGS. AND THERE ARE CLEARLY READING THE ASSESSORS HANDBOOKS. BUT I WOULD ADD THAT IT IS ALWAYS OUR RESPONSIBILITY AS SUCCESSORS TO EDUCATE ABOARD WHEN THERE IS A DISPUTE. OR AN IMPORTANT MATTER THAT THERE CAN AN APPEALS BOARD A BOARD OF SUPERVISORS OR A BOARD OF EQUALIZATION. ASSESSORS ARE THE SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO ENSURE WE PROVIDE BACKGROUND AT LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR THESE DECISIONS WE'VE MADE. AS FOR COMPENSATION THAT DEBATE COULD TAKE WEEKS AND I'M RUNNING OUT OF TIME SO I'LL PASS ON THAT. I WOULD BE REMISS IF I DID NOT MENTION THAT BEER WE STAFF IN INTERNAL OPERATIONS HAVE SUFFERED. AS A RESULT OF A B.. ONE OH TWO WHEN STAFF IS FACED WITH THE TYPE OF UPHEAVAL AND UNCERTAINTY BROUGHT ON BY THAT MASSIVE IT CHANGE. IT AFFECTS PRODUCTIVITY AND EFFICIENCY. STAFF SALARIES ARE INSUFFICIENT TO RETAIN OR ATTRACT THE BEST AND THE BRIGHTEST. AND THE NEW CONSTRAINTS ON HIRING AND OTHER ADMINISTRATIVE DECISIONS HAVE ESSENTIALLY HANDCUFF THE AGENCY. THE BOP HAS LOST ITS ORGANIZATIONAL MEMORY AND I BELIEVE THAT WILL HAVE LONG TERM NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES. WE HAVE ABOUT ONE MINUTE MA'AM. THANK YOU I THINK I CAN DO THAT BUT I'LL JUST TALK FAST. WE BELIEVE THE PUBLIC'S RIGHT TO EXPECT THAT THE ADMINISTRATION OF PROPERTY TAX LAWS INDEPENDENT TRANSPARENT FAIR EQUITABLE NONPARTISAN AND ACCESSIBLE. THE STRAIGHT SHOULD BE TRUE OF LOCAL ASSESSOR'S AS WELL AS A STATE AGENCY THAT OVERSEES AND ASSESS THEIR OFFICES. ANY CHANGES IN THE ADMINISTRATION SHOULD BE CAREFULLY AND THOROUGHLY REVIEWED. THE ASSOCIATION DOES NOT HAVE AN OFFICIAL POSITION ON A CA. TO AS THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION IS THE PRINCIPAL REGULATORY AGENCY OVERSEEING THE PRACTICES OF ASSESSORS. WE DEEM IT APPROPRIATE TO REMAIN NEUTRAL REGARDING ISSOLUTION IT'D BE -- WE IN ORDER TO AVOID ANY APPEARANCE OF CONFLICT OF INTEREST. HAVING SAID THAT WE STRONGLY BELIEVE THE CURRENT DUTIES OF THE BORDER NECESSARY TO MAINTAIN UNIFORMITY ACROSS THE STATE. WE BELIEVE IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THOSE DUTIES DO NOT GET LOST IN THE SHUFFLE. THIS WILL BE EVEN MORE IMPORTANT IF ACA TO EMMA SPLIT ROLE PROPOSAL ARE BOTH APPROVED BY VOTERS IN THE SAME YEAR. I'M ONE OF A FEW ASSESSORS IN THE STATE WHO WAS IN THE BUSINESS ONE PROPOSITION THIRTEEN PASSED. IT CREATED TURMOIL IN OUR OFFICES THAT IS DIFFICULT TO DESCRIBE. WE RELIED ON REGULAR COMMUNICATION WITH THE B. O. E. AS WE WORK TO IMPLEMENT THAT CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT. I WOULD EXPECT SIMILAR CHAOS IF WE FOUND OURSELVES DEALING WITH TWO CHANGES LIKE SPLIT ROLE AN ACA TO SIMULTANEOUSLY. MISTER CHAIR I REALLY WANT TO SAY THAT WE APPRECIATE YOU ASKING FOR OUR OPINION AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY HERE TODAY. I HOPE WE CAN GIVE YOU INFORMATION THAT WILL HELP YOU AND YOUR COMMITTEE MEMBERS AS YOU DELIBERATE WHAT WE THINK IS AN ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL. A SERIES OF QUESTIONS BEFORE YOU. IT IS MUCH BETTER PRESENT WE'RE GRATEFUL FOR YOUR TIME THANK YOU FOR MAKING THE AT THE TRIP AS WELL VERY GRATEFUL IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU. WE NOW WOULD LIKE TO BE TO TURN THE FLOOR OVER TO RICH BENSON HE'S A RETIRED ASSESSOR FROM THE COUNTY MARIN AND I DO WANT TO SAY CONGRATULATIONS BY THE WAY. A LONG AND DISTINGUISHED CAREER SIR WE WELCOME YOU TO COMMITTEE YOU HAVE FIVE NO MORE THAN SEVEN MINUTES AND WE'LL GIVE YOU ONE MINUTE PROMPT FLOORS SOURCE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE -- AS YOU KNOW MY NAME IS RICH BENSON -- I GUESS I'M A LITTLE LUCKY BECAUSE I'M RETIRED AND I LISTENED CAREFULLY TO SOME YOUR QUESTION SO I'M GONNA TRY TO PICK UP SPECIFICALLY. ON SOME OF THOSE BUT JUST AS A MATTER OF BACKGROUND. WAS THIRTY THREE YEARS IN THE ASSESSOR'S OFFICE ACTED FUNCTION. OF FOR THE COUNTY OF MARIN -- YEAH I ALWAYS CONSIDERED THE WORK THAT I DID SEXY -- AND WOULD TAKE -- ISSUE TO THE FACT THAT PROPERTY TAXES OR ANYTHING BUT SEXY. AND I THINK THAT'S CRITICAL BECAUSE I THINK WHAT. THE TAXPAYERS DESERVE WHAT THE PEOPLE DESERVE -- NOT NECESSARILY TO POINT TO ME BUT TO SAY THAT YOU KNOW WHAT YOU REALLY WANT IS SOMEBODY THAT IS SO COMMITTED AND DEDICATED THEIR CAREER. TO THE PROCESS OF PROPERTY TAXATION DAD DAY BECOME A STUDENT OF IT THAT THEY STUDY IT THEY BECOME A SUBJECT MATTER EXPERT. AND THEY DEVELOP A LEVEL OF EXCERPT CURTICE. THAT IS ON COMPROMISE A BALL NOW I WILL SAY TO MISS DAVIS THAT SHE AND I CO TAUGHT MANY YEARS AGO THE ONE AND ONLY ETHICS CLASS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FOR ASSESSORS. AND WHEN WE LOOK AT WHAT YOU'RE ASKING FOR TODAY. I WOULD POINT TO A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT I THINK ARE VERY IMPORTANT. ONE IS THAT THE NATURE OF WHAT IS THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION BUT THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION WAS SOMETHING THAT BEGAN AS YOU'VE HEARD OVER AND OVER OVER A HUNDRED AND FORTY YEARS AGO -- AND IT WAS THE PURPOSE WAS TO EQUALIZE THE ASSESSMENT BETWEEN OR CROSS COUNTIES FOR THAT COUNTIES HAD THE SAME LEVEL. SINCE PROP THIRTEEN THAT'S GONE WE DON'T DO THAT ANYMORE WHAT WE TRY TO DO REALLY INSTEAD OF EQUALIZATION IS UNIFORMITY. AND THAT'S REALLY MORE TODAY WHAT THE FUNCTION OF THE BOARD IS LET ME READ TO YOU THE MISSION STATEMENT OF THE BOARD AND SEE IF YOU CAN. GATHER FROM THIS THE CONNECTION THAT THE PUBLIC. TO WHAT THEIR FUNCTION IS TO THEIR MISSION STATEMENT. THE MISSION STATEMENT OF THE BOARD OF VEHICLES TO SERVE THE PUBLIC THROUGH FAIR AFFECT OF AN EFFICIENT TAX ADMINISTRATION. WHAT'S THAT. WHAT WE HAVE TODAY IS A DISCONNECT IN SOME MEASURE BETWEEN EITHER THE? PEOPLE THAT ELECTED BY MEMBERS OF THE BOARD EXHORTATION AND WHAT THEIR FUNCTIONS ARE. AND I THINK THERE'S A GREAT OPPORTUNITY HERE FOR US AS A STATE FOR YOU TO LOOK AT HOW DO YOU MAKE THOSE CONNECTIONS. THERE ARE PROS AND CONS TO BOTH HAVING ELECTIVES AND APPOINTED OR NON ELECTIVES IN -- THE CAPACITY OF THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION OF WHAT THE ROLE IS IT'S MY OPINION THAT YOU CAN HAVE BOTH. AND I THINK -- AT LEAST SINCE THE TIME OF PROP THIRTEEN THAT WE KNOW A LOT MORE ABOUT PROPERTY TAXES THAT WE DID. AND THAT THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO BUILD THAT STRUCTURE SOMETHING THAT'S VERY HARD TO DO WITH ELECTED BUT IT IS EASY TO DO TO BUILD STRUCTURE. ETHICS AND STANDARDS WHEN YOU'RE NOT DEALING WITH ELECTED CONSTITUTIONAL OFFICERS. OUT OF SENATOR NIELSEN WITH REGARD TO YOUR QUESTION ON PROPOSITION THIRTEEN AND LET'S SAY THE VULNERABILITY THAT IT JUST BLOWS -- TO WITH SPECIFICALLY TO THE SPLIT ROLE IT'S BEEN MY OBSERVATION THAT WHEN THESE THINGS HAPPEN AND BEAR IN MIND THE SO CALLED CORRUPTION THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACE. WITH THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION WHETHER ITS RECENT OR IN THE PAST HAS BEEN CYCLICAL FOR THE WHOLE PERIOD OF TIME FOR THE HUNDRED FORTY YEARS. WELL THAT'S NOTHING NEW AND YOU KNOW REALITY IS YOU GOTTA GO THROUGH IT AGAIN YES WOULD YOU GO THROUGH IT AGAIN IF IT'S ELECTED OR APPOINTED. PROBABLY YES. BUT YOU CAN BUILD CONTROLS IN THE APPOINTED POSITIONS THAT YOU CAN'T DO IN THE ELECTED POSITIONS. AND WE HAVE ALL THE EXPERIENCE WE HAVE TO LOOK AT HOW DO WE DO THAT NOW IN TERMS OF BUILDING THAT STRUCTURE CREATING ETHICS CREATING STANDARDS CREATING TRAINING IT CETERA. THAT MAY BE ABSENT IN THE IN THE CONTEXT OF ELECTIVES NOW WITH REGARD TO WHEN DOES THAT HAPPEN WHEN. YOU GET A PROPOSITION THIRTEEN ROLL IT HAPPENS WHEN THERE'S A DEFICIENCY WHEN THE VOTERS LOOK AND SAY THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WITH TAXATION BE IT PROPERTY TAXATION. AND THEY SAY IF THE LEGISLATURE OF THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION WHOMEVER IS NOT WILLING TO CHANGE IT. AND WE'RE GOING TO CHANGE IT SO IT'S REALLY A CANARY IN THE COAL MINE. ONE OF THE MOLES IN MY OBSERVATION OF MY TENURE AS AN ELECTED. AND I SAY MY COMMENTS WITH RESPECT TO ALL ELECTED'S OF MEMBERS OF THE BOARD NOW MEMBERS OF THE BOARD IN THE PAST AND I'VE BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH MEMBERS OF BOARD. FOR NEARLY THIRTY YEARS -- AND I'VE HAD THE THE BENEFIT OF BEING ABLE TO LOOK AT LEGISLATIVE THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN IDEAS THAT I'VE BROUGHT FORWARD I'VE HAD COURT CASES GO UP THROUGH THE COURT OF APPEALS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- I'VE TAUGHT ME MANY DIFFERENT SESSIONS AT CETERA BUT SPECIFICALLY WHEN WE LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENS THE VOTERS REACT WHEN IT'S NOT WORKING EFFICIENTLY. AND WHEN I THINK ABOUT PROPERTY TAXES TODAY AND ONE OF THE DYNAMICS BETWEEN THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION IN THE ASSESSORS. IT'S SOMETIMES RAISES THE QUESTION IS THE BOARD REACTIVE OR THEY PROACTIVE OR THEY CONFLICT ADVERSE. DO THEY REACT TO THEIR CONSTITUENTS OR THE INFLUENCE THAT'S UPON THEM AND WITH REGARD TO THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ASSESSORS. FOR INTERESTED PARTIES AND THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION WHILE PROVISION IS BEEN THAT THEY'VE ACTED MORE ARBITRATORS ARE MEDIATORS THAN A TAXPAYING AUTHORITY. AND THAT'S A BIG DIFFERENCE AND I THINK THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO MOVE AWAY FROM THAT IN ONE PROBABLY CLOSE SO I'M GONNA LEAVE IT FOR ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE -- CERTAINLY I WOULD ENCOURAGE WHAT EVER MECHANISM YOU WOULD HAVE TO TAP INTO THE EXPERTISE OF PEOPLE WHO CAN BRING FORWARD -- LOTS OF INDEPENDENT OBJECTIVE INFORMATION TO YOU TO HELP YOU BECAUSE THE PROCESS OF PROPERTY TAXATION TODAY AND I SPEAK PRIMARILY FROM AN ASSESSOR. IS A VERY COMPLICATED ONE AND IT DESERVES PEOPLE WHO SERVE IN IT WHO HAVE A HISTORY WHO HAVE AN INTEREST WHO HAVE THE TENACITY AND WANT TO STUDY IT. AS IF THEY'RE GETTING A BACHELOR'S OR MASTER'S DEGREE THAT'S WHAT IT DESERVES. THANK YOU SO MUCH SIR THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TODAY IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU. NOW I WOULD LIKE TO TURN THE FLOOR OVER TO TO REACH TO MAY REPRESENT THE CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION YOUR FIVE NO LONGER THAN SEVEN MINUTES AND I'LL GIVE YOU ONE MINUTE PROMPT. WELCOME BACK IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THERESA MAY REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION JUST LAST MONTH WE CELEBRATED NINETY THREE YEARS OF EXILE SCHMIDT. AND DURING THOSE YEARS WE WORK WITH BOTH STATE AND FEDERAL LOCAL TAXING AGENCIES OUR GOALS ARE TO ADVANCE TAX POLICIES THAT PROMOTE ECONOMIC GROWTH AND JOBS IN CALIFORNIA. IS TO STREAMLINE TAX ADMINISTRATION AND TAX COMPLIANCE BOTH TAXPAYERS. AND TAX AGENCIES AS WELL AS TO PROMOTE POLICIES THAT ADVANCE GOVERNMENT EFFICIENCIES AND PROMOTE OVERSIGHT OF PROGRAMS. IN THE NINETY THREE YEARS THAT WE WORKED WITH THE STATE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION BOTH PRE AND POST. A B. ONE OH TO YOU FASTER TO US TO DISCUSS SOME OF THE IMPORTANT ROLES. OF THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION AND FOR US THERE ARE THREE MAIN GOALS. AND THREE MAIN RESPONSIBILITIES THAT ARE VERY IMPORTANT FOR CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS. THE FIRST IS TO INSURE THAT PROPERTY TAXES ARE ASSESSED CORRECTLY AND APPROPRIATELY UNDER THE LAW. THAT TAXES ARE NOT OVER SAYS NOR ARE THEY UNDER SAYS. THAT HIS SON BY THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION COUNTY ASSESSMENT SURVEYS THAT IS A COUNTY BY COUNTY INDEPENDENT AUDIT THE LOOKS AT DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES LOOKS AT RESIDENTIAL ASSESSMENT INDUSTRY ASSESSMENTS. AS WELL AS DIFFERENT TYPES OF BUSINESS THE ASSESSMENT TO ENSURE THAT THE COUNTIES AT HERE TO THE LAW. THEY STRIVE 41100% A CENT ASSESSMENT AS OPPOSED TO NINETY EIGHT UNDER ASSESSMENT OR 11002% OVER ASSESSMENT. THE OTHER VERY IMPORTANT FUNCTION AS MENTIONED BY THE ASSESSORS AND OTHER PREVIOUS SPEAKER IS UNIFORMITY WITH FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES FIFTY EIGHT DIFFERENT ASSESSORS. SOMEWHERE NEW WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN A PERSON MOVES A RESIDENCE FROM ONE COUNTY TO ANOTHER. THERE ARE THE SIMILAR LAWS THAT APPLY WITH REGARD TO THEIR PROPERTY ASSESSMENT IN FOR BUSINESSES THAT OPERATE IN MULTIPLE COUNTIES THAT THERE ARE SIMILAR SET OF RULES THAT APPLY TO HOW THAT PROPERTY IS VALUED IN THE SIZE. AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST. THE COUNTY HAS PROPERTY ASSESSMENT FOR RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY BUT NOT A WHAT IS CALLED STATUS AS PROPERTIES. THE CONSTITUTION PROVIDES INVEST THE AUTHORITY WITH THE STATE TO ASSESS INDUSTRIES THAT HAVE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT CROSS PROPERTY LINES. EXAMPLES OF RAILROADS BECAUSE THE RAILROAD TRACK TRAVELS FROM FROM COUNTY THROUGH THE OTHER IT ONLY MAKES SENSE TO HELP THE STATE ASSESS THAT TAXPAYER AND ALL OF ITS RAILROAD TRACKS WITHIN THE STATE. AS OPPOSED TO HAVING EACH OF THE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES ASSESSED ONE SEGMENT OF THAT OF THAT TRACK. ANOTHER QUESTION THAT THE COMMITTEE HAS ASKED US TO ADDRESS IS WHETHER OR NOT THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION SHOULD RETAIN THE RETAINED INTACT WHETHER OR NOT THOSE FUNCTION SHOULD BE MOVED TO ANOTHER AGENCY. IN IN OUR HUMBLE OPINION WE DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH DATA IN ORDER TO EVALUATE THAT AT THIS JUNCTURE. WHY IS THAT? THE AGENCY IN THE RESTRUCTURING HAS ONLY BEEN IN EXISTENCE FOR A LITTLE BIT OVER NINETEEN MONTHS. ADDITIONALLY FROM WHAT WE HEAR THE BOARD DOES NOT HAVE THE SUFFICIENT RESOURCES IN ORDER TO CARRY OUT ITS STATUTORY FUNCTIONS. THE BOARD IS ALSO GOING THROUGH A TRANSITION PERIOD WITH FOUR NEW ELECTED MEMBERS THEY'VE JUST ADOPTED NEW GOVERNANCE POLICIES TO HELP AVOID SOME OF THE PROBLEMS THAT HAVE BEEN PLAGUED BY THE PREVIOUS BOARD. AND ALSO THERE'S A NEW CHAIR THAT HAS A NEW AGENDA HOW TO DIRECT THE POOR WITH FOUR NEW MEMBERS OR THREE NEW MEMBERS HOPING. TO IMPLEMENT THOSE POLICIES BUT HAVE ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT IN OUR HISTORY OF WORKING IN THIS AREA. THAT ELECTED OFFICIALS AND HAVING ELECTED BODY TENDS TO LEND ITSELF TO MORE ACCOUNTABILITY. ELECTED OFFICIALS SUCH AS YOURSELF ALSO BRING A UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE YOU HAVE AN AGRICULTURAL BACKGROUND CENTER MORE LUCK HAS AN ACCOUNTING AND FINANCE BACKGROUND. SENATOR NIELSEN HAS A PUBLIC SAFETY BACKGROUND ALL OF THOSE UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE BRING MORE TO THE TABLE THAN JUST HAVING AN EMPLOYEE OF THE STATE OR AN AGENCY DISCUSS THE TECHNICAL IMPLICATIONS OF THE LAW. YOU ALSO ASKED US TO TAKE A LOOK AT RECOMMENDATION TO PROVIDE YOU WITH SOME THOUGHTS AND OBSERVATIONS. WE HAVE SOME GENERAL OBSERVATIONS AND THAT IS. IF THE LEGISLATURE WERE TO CHANGE THE STRUCTURE OF THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION. WE ASK THAT THE PROGRAMS WITHIN THE B. O. E. BE TRANSFERRED INTACT BUT THE PROGRAMS NOT BE BROKEN UP IN SEGMENT INTO DIFFERENT AGENCIES. THE SECOND IS WE ASK THAT THE NOTICE ON ANY INFORMATION BE PROVIDED TO TAXPAYERS IN ADVANCE. TO MITIGATE ANY DISRUPTION IN COMPLIANCE DURING THE TRANSITION PROCESS. AND ALSO FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER SOME KIND OF TRANSITIONAL SAFE HAVEN SO THAT TAXPAYERS NOT PENALIZED IF THEY MISSED DEADLINES BECAUSE THERE'S A NEW MAILING ADDRESS OR THERE'S A NEW CHANGE IN POLICY PROCEDURE. BUT WE ALSO HAVE THREE VERY IMPORTANT SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS TO CONSIDER. THE FIRST IS THAT STATE ASSESSED REMAIN CENTRALIZED AT THE STATE LEVEL. NOT ONCE AGAINST GOES TO POLICIES THAT ASSESS. THESE DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES SUCH AS RAILROADS UTILITIES AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS THAT HAVE CABLES AND WROTE TRACKS THAT RUN ACROSS ALL THE DIFFERENT. COUNTIES CENTRALIZATION WAS IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT ONE ENTITY CAN PROVIDE GREATER UNIFORMITY. AND THAT'S VER IMPORTANT FOR AFTER STATES CAN YOU IMAGINE A FLOCK TRICITY ONE OUT. CAN YOU IMAGINE IF A RAILROAD STOP WORKING AND NOT ABLE TO TRANSPORT GOODS OUR TELECOMMUNICATION SYSTEMS WERE UNABLE TO WORK BECAUSE OF DIFFERENT ASSESSMENT ROLLS AND THERE IS A POSSIBLE LEAD DATE AS WELL WORD THE ASSESSMENT HAS TO BE DONE BY A CERTAIN TIME IN ORDER. TO EVALUATE AS THAT THOSE PROPERTIES. THE SECOND IS TO CONTINUE THE REGULATORY GUIDANCE AT THE STATE CURRENTLY PROVIDES TO THE ASSESSOR. THAT PROMOTES UNIFORMITY BUT ALSO HELPS TO AVOID COSTLY LITIGATION BETWEEN TAXPAYERS AS WELL AS COUNTY ASSESSORS. AND WE ALSO ASK THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER HAVING THE BILL WE PROVIDE SOME ADDITIONAL TRAINING -- IN SUPPORT OF THE ASSESSORS NEWLY ELECTED ASSESSORS HAVE THE CA BUT WE BELIEVE THAT THERE CAN BE SOME ADDITIONAL TRAINING SUPPORT THAT THE STATE CAN PROVIDE TO THESE ASSESSORS. IT'S A VERY BIG COMPLEX AREA. AND IT'S AN AREA WHERE IT LAST YEAR IN A VOTE ME SOME NEW ASSESSORS -- SENT SOME ILLEGAL THREATENING LETTERS TO TAXPAYERS OF THREATENING IMPRISONMENT IF TAXPAYERS DID NOT PROVIDES QUESTIONNAIRES. TO THE CAA'S CREDIT THEY DID POLICE AND THEY DID CORRECT THOSE ACTIONS BUT I THINK THAT JUST DEMONSTRATES THE FACT THAT THERE IS ADDITIONAL TRAINING AND NATIONAL WORK THAT CAN. BE MITIGATED AND CAN BE INCREASED BETWEEN THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION AND THE ASSESSORS. AND WITH THAT WE APPRECIATE YOUR TIME AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU SO MUCH VERY VERY GRATEFUL MR MAY -- THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT YOU PROVIDED VERY HELPFUL I AM WE'LL BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION AND THANK YOU FOR TAKING SO MUCH TIME TO GET A PART FOR THIS AND I TAKING THAT INTO ACCOUNT AS FAR AS WHERE WE WANT YOU. TO GO SO VERY GRATEFUL AND NEXT UP IS ALWAYS. WE NOW WOULD LIKE ME TO TURN THE FLOOR OVER TO SAMANTHA CORBIN SHE'S REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA TAX REFORM ASSOCIATION. CORBIN WELCOME BACK TO COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE YOU GO FIVE NO MORE THAN SEVEN MINUTES AND I'LL GIVE YOU ONE MINUTE PROMPT. THANKS FOR HAVING ME -- I STATED MY NAME SAMANTHA CORBIN I'M HERE SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA TAX REFORM ASSOCIATION THE PRIMARY GOAL OF SEE TERRY IS THE DEVELOPMENT AND MAINTENANCEOF THE STATE TAX SYSTEM THAT IS PROGRESSIVE ELASTIC AND EQUITABLE FOR CALIFORNIANS. OR BOARD IS COMPRISED PRIMARILY A SOME OF THE LARGEST LABOR UNIONS IN THE STATE. HE TERRY HAS WORKED REGULARLY WITH THE BE -- WE SINCE THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES -- FOLLOWING THE PASSAGE OF PROP THIRTEEN WHICH HAPPENS TO COINCIDE WITH THE ORGANIZATION'S BIRTH -- SINCE THAT TIME WE'VE BEEN WE'VE HAD EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE WORKING WITH THE BOARD ON A WIDE RANGE OF ISSUES. INCLUDING THOSE THAT USED TO BE UNDER THEIR PURVIEW AS WELL AS OF COURSE PROPERTY TAX WHICH REMAINS UNDER THEIR JURISDICTION TO DATE. THERE'S YOUR PROPERTY TAXES ONE THAT HAS BEEN A PRIORITY FOR C. T. OR A AND HAS BEEN SINCE THE ORGANIZATION'S INCEPTION AND BACKED AS HAS BEEN DISCUSSED TODAY -- WERE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THE PROPERTY TAX REFORM MEASURE CURRENTLY ON THE TWENTY TWENTY BALLOT A AND ARE QUITE AWARE AND I'M I'M A BELIEVER THE POINT OF OF SOME OF THE CONCERNS OF HOW THAT THAT COULD BE IMPLEMENTED IF PASSED. BY GIVEN POTENTIAL CHANGES TO THE B. O. E.. AS CONTROLLER HE INDICATED THIS CONVERSATION WE'RE HAVING TODAY IS NOT A NEW ONE I BELIEVE THE FIRST CALLS FOR DISBANDING THE PO WE ACTUALLY BEGAN RIGHT AFTER IT WAS FORMED IN ABOUT. NINETY EIGHTEEN SEVENTY NINE BUT SINCE NINETEEN FORTY THREE THE LEGISLATURE'S BUDGET ADVISER EVEN HAS RECOMMENDED GETTING RID OF IT ENTIRELY -- UNFORTUNATELY AND THIS HAS BEEN WELL DOCUMENTED AND AND IT I HOPE THE GENTLEMAN HAD MENTIONED EARLIER THAT PSYCHOLOGICAL IN NATURE THE BEER WE AS LONG BEEN A SOURCE OF NEPOTISM SCANDAL AND AND EFFICIENCY FOR REALLY GENERATIONS -- THE JURY'S LONG BEEN CRITICAL OF THE ADJUDICATORY FUNCTION OF THE BEER WE BOTH ITS BASIC STRUCTURE AND HOW IT'S IMPLEMENTED -- THIS LEGISLATION HAS SUPPORTED AND TO THAT END WE WERE VERY ACTIVE IN SUPPORTING AND WORKED DILIGENTLY TO PASS A B. ONE OH TWO IN THE LAST LEGISLATIVE CYCLE -- OF COURSE THAT MEASURE COULD ONLY GO SO FAR GIVEN THE CONSTITUTIONAL NATURE OF THE BOARDS ELECTED POSITIONS AND THUS WE ARE HERE TODAY -- THERE ARE SOME WHO WOULD SUGGEST THAT THE BE A WE NO LONGER HAS FUNCTION OR PURPOSE IN FACT I CAN TELL YOU MUCH TO MY TERRIFYING DISMAY I WAS WATCHING ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND TWITTER IN OTHER PLACES AS EVEN HIGH LEVEL -- DEMOCRAT AND REPUBLICAN PARTY OFFICIALS WERE SUGGESTING WHO TO VOTE FOR IN THE UPCOMING ELECTION CYCLE AND SOME SENSE SAID SIMPLY LEAVE THE BE -- WE BLANK THEY DON'T DO ANYTHING ANYWAY -- HOWEVER I CAN ASSURE YOU THERE ARE STILL SOME VERY CRITICAL FUNCTIONS THAT REGARDLESS OF THE FATE OF AN ELECTED OR APPOINTED BOARD OR STRUCTURE MUST BE PRESERVED -- I THINK THE NUMBER MENTION WAS FIVE POINT SEVEN TRILLION IN PROPERTY TAX ASSESSMENTS WITH OVER SIXTY BILLION OF THAT GOING TO THE GENERAL FUND A YEAR -- I'VE BEEN AROUND DOING ERROR OF THAT -- IS FAIRLY SIGNIFICANT FOR THE WORK OF THIS BODY -- SO REGARDLESS WE BELIEVE THAT THE FUNCTIONS OF THE BOARD MUST BE PRESERVED THE FUNCTIONS OF THE AGENCY MUST BE PRESERVED AND IN PARTICULAR THE COUPLE HUNDRED DEDICATED CIVIL SERVANTS. WHO WORK ON THESE ISSUES SHOULD BE PRESERVED AND NOT FORGOTTEN AS THESE CONVERSATIONS CONTINUE -- TO SENATOR BELLS COMMENTS EARLIER MADE REGARDING THE GAS TAX VOTE I THINK THAT'S A GREAT EXAMPLE OF EVEN WITH THE REDUCTION IN THE SCOPE OF RESPONSIBILITIES THE POTENTIAL OF A POLITICAL AN ELECTED BOARD. TO FRANKLY LEGISLATE FROM THE BENCH SO TO SPEAK END OF TAXES AND UNITS EARLY IN APPROACH AS CONTROL SO NOTED CALIFORNIA'S UNIQUE AND POSSESSING AN ELECTED BOARD FOR THIS PURPOSE. AT EIGHTY ONE OH TWO WAS IN LARGE PART NECESSARY AS A RESULT OF THE B. ALWAYS FAILURE AS AN ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCY ONE THAT IS SUBJECT TO POLITICAL NUMERIC MANEUVERING RATHER THAN A STRAIGHTFORWARD ADMINISTRATION. STATUS AS PROPERTY FUNCTION IN PARTICULAR SHOULD LIKE ALL OTHER FORMS OF ADJUDICATION BE NON POLITICAL UNFORTUNATELY AND REPEATEDLY THIS HAS NOT ALWAYS BEEN THE CASE. OVER THE YEARS THIS HAS RESULTED IN DECISION MAKING BY SOME MEMBERS AND OR IT RATIONS OF THE BOARD THAT HAS BEEN FAR MORE RESPONSIVE TO INDUSTRY THAN TO COUNTY ASSESSOR'S BOARD OF SUPERVISORS AND EVERYDAY CALIFORNIANS. IN FACT OVER THE YEARS MUCH OF C. TERRY'S WORK WITH THE BEER WE HAS CENTERED AROUND MITIGATING FOR THE OVER PUT OVER POLITICIZATION OF THAT AGENCY IS ADJUDICATORY ROLE. SPECIFICALLY WE'VE SEEN THE BEER WE UNDER ASSESS THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY IN PARTICULAR WE HAVE STRUGGLED TO HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE TO IN FOR SALES TAX COLLECTION WITH ONLINE RETAILERS SUCH AS AMAZON SINCE THE LATE NINETIES -- THESE FACTS BECOME EVEN MORE ALARMING WHEN YOU COMPARE THE EXPERTISE AND CAPACITY TO THE BOARD TO A TIP TYPICAL COUNTY ASSESSMENT APPEALS BOARD. CERTAINLY THOSE INDIVIDUALS -- ARE ELECTED AS WELL BUT THERE IS A HUGE DISCREPANCY IN THE NUMBER OF TRAINING -- EXPERTISE AND I THINK THERE WERE OTHER COMMENTS I WON'T REITERATE THAT RELATED TO SOME OF THE THE BELT AND SUSPENDERS THAT ENSURE THAT THESE BODIES OPERATE IN A WAY THAT IS AN ETHICAL AND EFFICIENT -- ABSENT A DECISION MAKING BOARD WITH -- VERIFIABLY APPROPRIATE BACKGROUND AND TAX ADMINISTRATION AND IT DID ADJUDICATION AND NO POLITICAL MANAGEMENT EXCUSE ME MOTIVATION HOW CAN TAXPAYERS BE ASSURED THAT THE DECISIONS OF THE BOARD WILL BE NOTED BY APPROPRIATE FACTORS. AND ARE NOT WRONGLY INCENTIVIZED CURRENTLY UNDER THE CURRENT MODEL THEY CANNOT. WIN WRONGLY MINDED OR MOTIVATED DECISION MAKING DOES OCCUR AND THERE IS NO REASON EVEN UNDER A NEW BOARD TWO I BELIEVE THAT THIS COULD NOT OCCUR AGAIN IT IS IN FACT THIS LEGISLATIVE BODY THAT IS LEFT TO CLEAN UP THE BASS AND IT IS TAXPAYERS WHO PAY THE PRICE. OF COURSE AS I MENTIONED THERE KEEP FUNCTIONS THAT ARE WE WOULD WANT TO INSURE ARE PRESERVED -- AND SO WE WANT TO ENCOURAGE THIS BODY TO INSURE ANY LEGISLATIVE. REFORM EFFORTS WERE CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM EFFORTS PRESERVE THOSE FUNCTIONS EXISTING STATE JOBS AND ASSURE APPROPRIATE MECHANISMS FOR TAXPAYERS TO TAXPAYERS TO ACCESS INFORMATION AND SERVICES AS NEEDED -- AND I WOULD SAY THAT WE DON'T OFTEN AGREE ON A LOT MY COLLEAGUE NEXT TO AN AT NEXT TO ME AND A CITY OR A BUT WE DO APPRECIATE YOUR THOUGHTFUL SUGGESTIONS AND AGAIN WE JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT THIS BODY AS YOU DELIBERATE. CONSIDER THE IMPLICATIONS OF SORT OF TRANSFERRING POWER SHOULD THAT IN FACT OCCUR. THIS COMMENT THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR WORDS TODAY PRETTY GRATEFUL THANKS FOR BEING HERE WE NOW WOULD LIKE TO BE TO OPEN UP TO THE COMMITTEE. FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS I HAVE A JUST A COUPLE BUT WOULD LIKE TO GO TO SEE IF WE HAVE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE FOR OUR DISTINGUISHED PANEL. TWENTY NINE WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO ASK -- ET YOU NEED YOU CAN KEEP YOUR RESPONSE TO BATMAN AND A HALF -- TO TWO IS AN INDEPENDENTLY ELECTED BOARD OF EQUALIZATION STILL NECESSARY IN CALIFORNIA -- WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT IF THAT WERE TO BE. DISSOLVED IT EITHER BE STAND ALONE AGENCY OR ABSORB OUT WITHIN ANOTHER. AND IF YOU DO THINK THAT IT COULD BE ABSORBED ARE THERE ANY AGENCIES YOU BELIEVE ARE WELL SUITED. WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO WHO'D LIKE TO KICK US OFF. IN AND NO NEED TO RUSH THANK YOU. I THINK THE QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THE B. O. E. I STILL NEEDS TO BE ELECTED IS. PERHAPS SOMETHING YOU MIGHT WANT TO TALK TO YOUR OWN CONSTITUENTS ABOUT. I'D IS SINCE THE INCEPTION OF THIS CONVERSATION I'VE BEEN TALKING TO MY CONSTITUENTS LOCALLY -- AND WHILE CALAVERAS DOES NOT. IS NOT THE TAIL THAT WAGS THE DOG OF CALIFORNIA -- THEY'RE STILL VOTERS THEY STILL HAVE OPINIONS ABOUT WHAT THEY THINK. I SHOULD HAPPEN WITH AN ELECTED BODY AND THEY DO NOT. UNANIMOUSLY THUS FAR THOSE I'VE TALKED. TO I DO NOT SEE A REASON TO REMOVE THE ELECTIVE. LEVEL OF THE BOP -- SOME HAVE HAVE USED WORDS LIKE POWER GRAB. OTHERS HAVE SUGGESTED THAT THEY KEEP THERE ARE ELECTED OFFICIALS ACCOUNTABLE. HI IN THE ABSENCE OF YOU THE LEGISLATURE HOLDING THEM ACCOUNTABLE USING WHATEVER. OF RULES OR REGULATIONS YOU HAVE AVAILABLE TO YOU. HI IF HOWEVER THE STATE WERE TO GO THAT WAY -- YOUR FOLLOW UP QUESTION WAS I SHOULD IT BE A STANDALONE AGENCY OR ABSORPTION IF ABSORBED WHERE. I HAPPEN TO SIT ON THE STATE CONTROLLER'S COMMITTEE ON PROPERTY TAX COLLECTION PROCEDURES I WAS APPOINTED. BY THEN CONTROLLER JOHN CHONG HAVE BEEN REPORTED BY A BETTY. I REMEMBER ONE OF THE FIRST COMMENTS MADE TO ME BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF COUNTY TREASURERS AND TAX COLLECTORS AND WHAT HE SAID WAS. THE TAX COLLECTORS ARE JEALOUS OF THE ASSESSORS RELATIONSHIP WITH THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION. JEALOUS BECAUSE WE HAD A UNIQUE RELATIONSHIP WE WORKED WELL AND HAD OVERSIGHT THAT WAS BASED ON RESPECT. THE TAX COLLECTORS ARE OVERSEEN BY THE STATE CONTROLLER AS IS THE AUDITORS AUDITOR CONTROLLERS. FOR THE COUNTY SO THEIR RELATIONSHIP WAS WITH AN ELECTED OFFICIAL A SINGLE ELECTED OFFICIAL. AS I'VE THOUGHT ABOUT IT THAT OVER THE YEARS AND IT'S BEEN ABOUT SIX YEARS SINCE I FIRST HEARD THAT COMMENT. I REALLY DON'T SEE ANOTHER AGENCY WHERE ASSESSORS MIGHT CONSIDER THESE TASKS RELATED SO I DON'T SEE STATE CONTROLLER AT BEING RELATED I DON'T SEE FINANCE CERTAINLY NOT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OR SECRETARY OF STATE. I WOULD ECHO SOME OF THE COMMENTS YOU HEARD EARLIER -- THAT I WOULD I WOULD QUESTION PUTTING OR ABSORBING THESE TASKS IN AN AGENCY THAT WITH A BUREAUCRATIC APPOINTMENTS IF YOU WILL. SO I WOULD SUGGEST THAT IT WOULD NEED THANK YOU SO MUCH HAVE STANDALONE. AND REMAIN INDEPENDENTLY ELECTED AT SWEAR MY CONSTITUENTS ARE TALKING TO ME ABOUT I AM IMPRESSED BECAUSE BOOKS YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHY AND LET ALONE BORDER LEGALIZATION SO -- CALAVERAS IS ALL OVER IT SO AT LEAST -- I'M I'M IMPRESSED THANK YOU SO MUCH A LOT ABOUT RETAIN OF IT REALLY THANK YOU VERY MUCH BETTER PRESIDENT. THIS TO ME. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- IN OUR OPINION BASED ON OUR WORK WITH THE TAX PAYERS. AN ELECTED BODY REALLY DOES LEND ITSELF MORE TO TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY -- YOU KNOW AS WE INDICATED EARLIER THE UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE OF ALL OF YOU COMING FROM YOUR DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS. REALLY HELPS HELLO YOU KNOW AS A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER ALSO REALLY HELPS. UNDERSTAND THE COMPLEXITIES AND CHALLENGES THAT TAXPAYER MAY HAVE TO COMPLY WITH DIFFERENT LAWS AND REGULATIONS AND ONLY AT THE STATE LEVEL OR TAX AGENCY. BUT THE DIFFERENT LOCAL REGULATIONS THAT ALSO HAVE. TO BE TAKE INTO ACCOUNT AND COMPLY WITH RANDOM BEING. A NORMAL TAXPAYER -- IT IN TERMS OF THE ELECTED BODY YOU KNOW WHAT WE'VE SEEN TYPICALLY IS IF THERE IS WRONGDOING ON THE PART OF AN OFFICIAL OR OFFICIALS. TYPICALLY WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT OFFICIAL IS DISCIPLINED. AND THAT OFFICIALS NO LONGER ELECTED WE DON'T SEE TOO OFTEN THE ABOLISHMENT OF AN ENTIRE STATE AGENCY BECAUSE OF THE WRONG DOINGS OF A HANDFUL FEW. AND YOU KNOW WHAT. WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT IS. THE MORE CHANGES TO THE TAXING STRUCTURE. OF THE POTENTIAL FOR GREATER COMPLICATIONS THAT COULD RESULT IN INCREASED TAXPAYER CONFUSION. AND ALSO INCREASING THE COMPLEXITY FOR THE TAXPAYER TO IN ORDER TO FIRE THE REPORTS THAT THEY NEED TO IN ORDER TO PAY THE TAXES AND ESSENTIALLY COMPLY WITH THE LAW. NOW AS YOUR QUESTION WHETHER OR NOT IT CAN BE AN INDEPENDENT ENTITY. OR FOLDED I THINK OUR OBSERVATIONS ARE THAT IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THOSE FUNCTIONS TO BE. INTACT WHETHER IT'S TRANSFERRED OR AN INDEPENDENT ENTITY AND THE ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITY BUT ESPECIALLY THE EXPERTISE OF THE STAFF -- AND SPEAKING PRIMARILY TO THE STATE ASSESS PROPERTIES DIVISION EXPERTISE AND STAFF NEED TO BE TRANSFERRED AND ONCE AGAIN TRANSFERRED INTACT AS A PROGRAM. THAT NOT BROKEN UP IN SEGREGATED INTO DIFFERENT SO MUCH SO OPTION A WOULD REMAIN INDEPENDENTLY ELECTED. AND THEN IF -- AGAIN. WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO RIGHT SO THIS IS MORE ON JUST YOUR AT GOT AT THIS POINT. INDEPENDENT ELECTED AND THEN BE IF THERE WAS A GIRL IN THE PAIN LIKE DID THEY NEED TO BE A STANDALONE. OR TRANSFERRED AS A UNIT YES YES THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH TO ME BENTON. THANK YOU MISTER KERR -- I THINK I WOULD HAVE -- TO LOOK AND SAY I DON'T THINK IT STILL NEEDS TO BE ELECTED ON ALL EXPLAIN WHY. AND I DO THINK THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD STRUCTURE FOR ACCESS AND ADVOCACY I THINK WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD IT SMARTLY. I THINK IN REGARD TO MY COMMENT ABOUT WHY THERE MIGHT BE CORRUPTION ELECTED APPOINTED OR WHATEVER THAT MIGHT LOOK LIKE PEOPLE ARE PEOPLE WERE JUST MERE MORTALS SO I MEAN WE CAN'T REALLY LOOK TO EACH OTHER AND SAY YOU KNOW. WE'RE GONNA HAVE PERFECTION WITH THE ELECTED OR NOT IT WE ALL COME IN ALL SHAPES AND SIZES. BUT IN TERMS OF THAT STRUCTURAL OPPORTUNITY I THINK THE THINGS THAT COME TOGETHER WITH NECESSARILY A NON ELECTED OR WHAT BUT IS THAT YOU CAN DEVELOP STANDARDS EASIER. WE'RE NO LONGER EQUALIZING THERE'S A BETTER OPPORTUNITY FOR JERSEY DISTRICT FOR DISTRIBUTION OF SKILL SETS THERE'S A BETTER OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK AT WHAT RESOURCES YOU NEED THERE'S A BETTER OPPORTUNITY TO DEVELOP CONFIDENCE. LEADERSHIP SUCCESSION PLANNING LONG TERM PROGRAMMING. FOCUS ON EFFICIENCIES QUALIFICATIONS AND ACCOUNTABILITY ALL THOSE THINGS IN MY OPINION GET VERY STRONG WITH THE ABILITY TO MANAGE THAT IN SOME FASHION AND WITH REGARD TO WHETHER IT NEEDS TO BE A STAND ALONE OR NOT. I THINK YOU'VE. YOU MAY EVEN BE BOXING YOURSELF IN THERE YOU MAY BE ABLE TO LOOK AT AND SAY WELL MAYBE WE DON'T HAVE TO DO EXACTLY THE SAME WHETHER IT'S A STANDALONE OR ELECTED. MAYBE WE CAN HAVE SOMEBODY WHO'S HAVE A BOARD OF DIRECTORS THAT COMES IN THREE OR FOUR OR FIVE DIFFERENT AGENCIES OR INCLUDING MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC. SO I'M NOT SURE IF I WAS LOOKING AT THIS I WOULD LOOK EVEN WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF IT HAS TO BE -- ONE WAY OR ANOTHER I THINK THIS OPPORTUNITY. THANK YOU SO MUCH MISS BENSON SO -- IN A PARAPHRASE HERE. YOUR BELIEVE NO LONGER NEED AN ELECTED BOARD AND TO BE DETERMINED ON WHAT A STRUCTURE WOULD LOOK LIKE -- IN HOW THAT -- ORG CHART WOULD BE. IF THE MOVE AWAY FROM ELECTED AND IT COULD BE INDEPENDENT IT COULD BE WITH MULTIPLE AGENCIES TO BE DETERMINED YES THANK YOU SO MUCH PRAY. FOR CORPORATE AND THEN ALL AT BRIEFLY TO THAT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I YOU KNOW I I WOULD pAFFILIATE MYSELF WITH A NUMBER OF MR BENTSEN'S COMMENTS I CERTAINLY. WE DON'T FEEL THAT THERE IS A NECESSITY FOR AN ELECTED BOARD PER SE -- BUT REGARDLESS THERE IS A DEFINITE NEED -- TO AS I MENTIONED EARLIER PUTS SOME BELTS AND SUSPENDERS ON THIS AND AND REALLY YOU KNOW YOU YOU DON'T SOME PEOPLE OUT A CAR WITHOUT AN AIRBAG AND AND SO IT IS INADEQUATE AT THIS POINT. GIVEN THE CYCLE AND HISTORICAL NATURE OF THE OCCASION AND AND OTHER THINGS GOING ON AT THE BE A WEEK TO LOOK AT HOW DO WE IMPROVE UPON THIS I THINK EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FLEMING SPOKE VERY PASSIONATELY ABOUT THE EXPERTISE AND THE STAFF. ON FORMERLY APPEAL WE CURRENTLY ABELIAN NOW IT CD TFA -- CERTAINLY I'M IN NO POSITION NOR DOES SEE JERRY HAVE A POSITION. ON SPECIFICALLY HOW WOULD TRANSFER COULD OR SHOULD LOOK -- BUT EXAMINING THE HUMAN CAPITAL THAT DOES EXIST BETWEEN CD TFA FOLKS WHO PREVIOUSLY WERE AT THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION HOW THOSE FUNCTIONS INTERSECT -- AND HOW THAT COULD PERHAPS MORE ARTFULLY BE DONE I KNOW THAT WE ARE NOT. IN A RUSH TO PUSH FORWARD ONE OH TWO AND IMPLEMENTED AS AND IT CERTAINLY WAS RUSHED IN AND IN A VERY. IT WAS IMPLEMENTED IN A VERY QUICK TURNAROUND AS IN THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR MENTIONED -- SO IT WOULD JUST ENCOURAGE YOU AND AND THIS LEGISLATIVE BODY TO BE THOUGHTFUL ABOUT THOSE AND AND REALLY -- YOU KNOW EVEN FOR OUR PURPOSES HOW DO WE LOOK AT AND INVESTIGATE WHAT IS THE HUMAN CAPITAL WHAT IS THE BEST WAY TO ENSURE TAXPAYERS CAN GET ACCESS TO INFORMATION -- AND AND SO THAT THE WORK CAN CONTINUE TO GO FORWARD BUT THAT WE CAN REALLY FINALLY PUT TO BED THE ISSUE OF CORRUPTION WITHIN AN ELECTED BOARD -- HOWEVER THAT IS ADDRESSED. THANK YOU SO MUCH MISS CORBIN THAT IS WHAT WE CALL A LITTLE FASHION TO TO TIE -- FROM THOSE WHO ARE FOCUSED ON THE DAY TO DAY. BUSINESS OF THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION BUT WHAT I THINK WE DID HEAR UNANIMOUSLY WHATEVER THE NEXT STEPS MAY BE. YOU HAVE TO BE THOUGHTFUL OUT YET THE CLASS MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE WORKING WITH ALL SIDES. TO MAKE IT WORK I WOULD THAT BE A FAIR ASSESSMENT. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR A PANEL AND BEEN VERY GRATEFUL FOR YOUR TIME THANK YOU FOR YOUR POINT ASSESSMENT AS WELL THANK YOU. PLACE IN GENERAL WE'RE NOW GOING TO BE OPEN IT UP FOR PUBLIC COMMENT WE'RE GOING TO ASK. EACH INDIVIDUAL WOULD LIKE TO BE TO SPEAK IF YOU COULD PLEASE COME THIS MICROPHONE. EACH MEMBER THE PUBLIC WILL BE GIVEN TWO MINUTES IF YOU DON'T MIND GIVING US YOUR FIRST AND LAST IN YOUR ORGANIZATION. WE'RE GRATEFUL THAT YOU'RE HERE GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER MEMBER -- SHARED -- ALSO AND MCGUIRE MY NAME IS JOHAN CLASE FOR THE RECORD -- BY SIR FOR FOURTEEN YEARS AS A MEMBER OF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE EIGHT YEARS AS CHAIR AND VICE CHAIR OF THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION. I REMEMBER THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD I'D LIKE TO JUST PROVIDE A BRIEF HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE -- FOR YOUR BENEFIT -- WHEN WE WERE ELECTED TO THE BOY RESIGNED? IN DISGRACE ONE WAS A BOARD MEMBER WHO HAD BEEN CONVICTED IN THE FEDERAL COURTS OF CRIMES THAT HE HAD COMMITTED IN THE STATE SENATE. AND THE OTHER WAS MY DIRECT PREDECESSOR OF MY DISTRICT -- A PERSON WHO HAD TO RESIGN BECAUSE HE CHEATED. ON HIS PER DIEM AND SO WE WERE UNDER THE SAME SCRUTINY THAT THIS BOARD TODAY YEAH THE NEW BORDERS UNDER. AND I'M RECOMMENDING TO THIS COMMITTEE THAT WE GIVE THIS NEW BOARD A CHANCE TO PROVE THEMSELVES AS ELECTED CONSTITUTIONAL OFFICERS. WHEN I WAS ELECTED TO THE BOARD -- WE REALLY EMBARKED ON A MODERNIZATION PROCESS WE WERE THE FIRST PUBLIC AGENCY TO CREATE A CUSTOMER SERVICES DIVISION. THE FIRST PUBLIC AGENCY IN CALIFORNIA TO GO ON THE INTERNET WE CREATED AN EIGHT HUNDRED TELEPHONE NUMBER WERE A TAXPAYERS COULD CALL IN WEIGHT LESS THAN A MINUTE AND A HALF. TO SPEAK TO A LIVE HUMAN BEING. WE ALSO -- DECIDED TO STREAMLINE THE HEARINGS AT THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION WHERE THERE ARE NOW TIME LIMITS FOR EACH SIDE -- WE USE THAT OPPORTUNITY TO ELIMINATE THE ENTIRE CASE BACK LOAD -- WE KEPT A PUBLISHED RECORD OF OUR CASE LOAD EACH YEAR AND PROVIDED IT TO THE LEGISLATURE. AND THAT CASE SLOW REFLECTED ABOUT THIRTY TWO THOUSAND DISPUTES A YEAR. THEN MORPHED INTO ABOUT THIRTY TWO HUNDRED TAX CASES INCLUDING ASSESSMENTS FOR THE PUBLIC UTILITIES IN CALIFORNIA. THE THIRTY SECONDS OF THOSE CASE -- EVER APPEALED TO THE COURTS AND WE LOST LESS THAN SEVEN OF THOSE CASES SO MY QUESTION. TO THE COMMITTEE IS. WAS IT REALLY A SMART IDEA TO GO TAX AGENCIES SHOULD THERE BE ELECTED OVERSIGHT ABSOLUTELY CALIFORNIA HAS A HISTORY OF TAXATION WITH REPRESENTATION. THERE ARE ELECTED COUNTY TAX ASSESSOR'S ELECTED TREASURER TAX -- A COLLECTORS THERE SHOULD BE AN ELECTED BOARD OF EQUALIZATION AND EVERY JUDGE IN THIS STATE IS ELECTED MANY OF WHO HERE TAX CASES. AFTER THEY MIGHT LEAVE THE CURRENT OFFICE OF TAX APPEALS WHERE THE FORMER BOARD OF EQUALIZATION SO IT'S SORT OF I'D BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH THIS COMMITTEE TO FIGURE OUT A WAY -- TO WHAT IS GOING TO BE THE FUTURE OF THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION -- MAY I POINT OUT A COUPLE OF OTHER QUESTIONS YOU SHOULD ASK FOR THE OFFICER CLOSER WE WOULD HAVE TO WRAP UP WITH OTHER FOLKS BY -- IF YOU CAN DO IN THIRTY SECONDS I WILL DO IN THIRTY SECONDS FIRST OF ALL YOU MIGHT WANT TO LOOK AT THE OFFICE OF TAX APPEALS TO SEE. ARE THEY ADJUDICATING CASES AS FAST AS THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION DID OR AT A SLOWER PACE. HAD THEY CLEANED UP A CASE BACKLOG. HAS THE FACT THAT NOW -- MANY PEOPLE HAVE TO USE ATTORNEYS TO APPEAR BEFORE THE OFFICE OF TAX APPEALS HAS THAT CUT OUT SMALLER BUSINESSES AND SMALLER TAXPAYERS. WHO CAN'T AFFORD TO LOSE AND BE REPRESENTED AT THE OFFICE OF TAX APPEALS AND FINALLY ONE OF THESE AGENCIES DOING NOW IN TERMS OF GOING AFTER THE UNDERGROUND ECONOMY WHERE THERE ARE A LARGE SECTORS OF EMPLOYEES IN CALIFORNIA? WERE BEING PAID IN CASH WHEN WE WOULD GO AFTER THEM AND MAKE SURE THEY WERE BEING PAID ON LEGITIMATE PAYROLLS THANK YOU VERY MUCH HE SO MUCH AS REMEMBERED THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. GOOD MORNING SIR. GOOD MORNING THANK YOU -- COMMITTEE I I JUST BRIEFLY WANT TO SPEAK FOR SOMEBODY THAT HASN'T SPOKEN SO FAR THIS MORNING THAT'S THE TAXPAYERS OF CALIFORNIA DO YOU SEE YOURSELF SIR I'M SORRY I'M SORRY MY NAME IS ERNIE DREIBERG I'M. LEGENDARY SO I THOUGHT YOU KNEW ME. I I COULDN'T AGREE WITH YOU SIR MORE I AGREE WITH YOU. I SPENT TWENTY YEARS AS A MEMBER AND FIVE TIMES CHAIR OF THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION I WAS ON THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD FIVE DIFFERENT TIMES I WAS THE ONLY PERSON WHAT DID. TAKE CARE BOTH BOARDS. AND I'VE SERVED WITH SEVERAL PEOPLE THAT BEEN HERE THIS MORNING. BUT I ALSO WAS THE AUTHOR OF THE CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS BILL OF RIGHTS WHICH REPRESENTS THE TAXPAYERS AND THAT'S THE PEOPLE THAT I THINK HAVEN'T SPOKEN HERE THEY SPOKE TO YOU. IN THE SEVERAL YEARS BACK WHEN THEY SAID WE WANT OUR TAX ASSESSORS TO BE ELECTED SO WE'RE GOING TO PUT IT IN THE CONSTITUTION. IT WASN'T EVEN A CLOSEVOTE THEY GOT OVER 60% THAT SAID WE WANT OUR TAX ASSESSORS TO BE. ELECTED. SO IF YOU'RE ASKING SHOULD THEY BE ELECTED THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA FERRARI SPOKEN TO THAT QUESTION AND THEY USE THE ANIMAL THE UNANIMOUS BUT BUT THE MAJORITY OF 60% SAID YES. I LACKED THE TAXPAYERS. I ALSO WANTED TO CLARIFY THE UNITED STATES AS A NET. PRESIDENT OF THE FTA I WAS TWICE WESTERN REGIONAL PRESIDENT I KNOW TAX ADMINISTRATION THROUGH THESE PEOPLE IN OTHER STATES. EVERYBODY'S BEEN SAYING THERE'S ONLY ONE ELECTED BOARD BUT THERE ARE ELECTED TAX OFFICIALS IN OTHER STATES TO RUN THEIR STATES. QUICKLY NORTH KERR NORTH DAKOTA AND MARIJUANA TO BUT TEXAS ALSO HAVE ELECTED TAX OFFICIALS. THE COLUMN CONTROLLERS. THE SECOND SIR. WELL I'VE GOT ONLY THREE SECONDS FOR ALL THESE MORE PEELS. OB PEARLS OF WISDOM THAT I WON BUT I WANT TO CORRECT THAT FOR THE RECORD. AND I'D ALSO SAY THAT THE THE LEGISLATION HAD ALL KINDS OF CONTROLS THAT THEY PUT ON THE BOARD IS SEPARATION THAT THEY PUT ON THE MEMBERS FROM THE AGENCY. IN THE TWENTY YEARS I WAS ON THE BOARD THAT ENDED IN. NINETY NINE WE NEVER HAD THOSE AND WE NEVER HAD A PROBLEM. BUT THEY HAVE DIFFERENT PEOPLE DIFFERENT TIMES I THINK YOU OUGHT TO GIVE THE CURRENT BOARD A CHANCE. TO SHOW WHAT KIND OF BOARD THEY WORK THANK YOU. THIS IS ESTHER THANK YOU SO MUCH ALSO I SAY THINK IF YOU'RE WORKING EXCUSE ME SAN DIEGO COUNTY IN YES YOU ARE A LEGEND SO THANK YOU SO MUCH SIR NICE OUT. THANK YOU AT LEAST IN MY MIND AND NOW YOU'RE GOOD. WHAT SAY YOU TO BRING THE SUNSHINE THOUGH TODAY? YEAH GOOD AFTERNOON THREE OF TWO MINUTES WELCOME YES HOW DO I FOLLOW THAT I DON'T KNOW -- MY NAME IS MARTY TWO CATS AND THANK YOU FOR THE TIME TODAY. I AM HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ALLIANCE OF TAXPAYER ADVOCATES WHICH IS AN ORGANIZATION OF PROPERTY TAX CONSULTANTS AT THE STATE AND LOCAL LEVEL WHOSE PURPOSE IS TO PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF CALIFORNIA PROPERTY TAXPAYERS. THERE ARE THREE POINTS I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE VERY QUICK. FIRST ACCESS TO ELECTED OFFICIALS IS KEY. IS KEY ESPECIALLY FOR SMALL BUSINESSES WHO DO NOT HAVE THE RESOURCES TO RETAIN COUNSEL. I PERSONALLY WORKED FOR TWO DIFFERENT MEMBERS OF THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION AND I CAN THINK OF NUMEROUS EXAMPLES. WE'RE A SMALL BUSINESS OR AN INDIVIDUAL HAS REACHED OUT TO THE ELECTED OFFICIALS OFFICE DIRECTLY AND WE WERE ABLE TO HELP. MAKE A DIFFERENCE. SECOND POINT AS WE'VE HEARD PROPERTY TAX IS CALIFORNIA'S SECOND LARGEST REVENUE STREAM NEARLY A QUARTER A PROPERTY TAX DOLLARS GO TO SCHOOLS AND ELECTED PO WE OVERSEAS THE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES. THAT ASSESS AND COLLECT THIS REVENUE YOU WANT PUBLICLY ELECTED OFFICIALS OVERSEEING THESE REVENUES. WITH ALL DUE RESPECT NOT AN ORGANIZATION LIKE THE DMV THE BEER WE PROVIDE THIS OVERSIGHT THROUGH PROPERTY TAX REGULATIONS GUIDANCE AND AUDITS. OF THE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES SENSORS OFFICES AND THIS ELECTED OVERSIGHT IS SO CRITICAL IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT CHECKS AND BALANCES THAT WE HAVE TAXPAYERS HAVE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IT PROTECTS NOT JUST DATA SAYS COMPANIES PUBLIC UTILITIES BUT ALL PROPERTY TAXPAYERS HOMEOWNERS SMALL BUSINESSES ALL OF THEM ACROSS THE BOARD. ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL THE ELECTED STATE CONTROLLER IN CALIFORNIA HAS OVERSIGHT OVER THE COUNTY TAX COLLECTOR'S IS WE'VE HEARD THE ELECTED ATTORNEY GENERAL HAS OVERSIGHT OVER THE DA'S IN THE SHERIFF'S. SO IT MAKES SENSE THAT BY THE SAME TOKEN AN ELECTED TAX BOARD THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION HAVE OVERSIGHT AND COLLABORATE WITH THE ASSESSORS. MY THIRD AND FINAL POINT IT IS IT IS AN EXAMPLE OF THIS COLLABORATION WITH THE CALIFORNIA'S ASSESSORS CALIFORNIA ASSESSORS ASSOCIATION AND THE B. O. E.. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE P. O. WE THROUGH THE LEADERSHIP OF THEN BE -- WE MEMBER AND NOW STATE TREASURER FIONA MA. ADOPTED IMPORTANT PROPERTY TO THIRTY SECONDS YES SIR WITHOUT THE LEADERSHIP OF THE ELECTED MEMBERS THESE CRITICAL REFORMS NEVER WOULD HAVE OCCURRED. AND BY ADEQUATELY FUNDING TO BE -- YOU ALLOW IT TO FOCUS ON ITS CORE CRITICAL PROPERTY TAX FUNCTIONS AND I KNOW THERE IS AN INTEREST FROM A BUDGET PERSPECTIVE IN TERMS OF SAVING MONEY. YOU CAN DO THAT BY STOPPING THE MOVE OF THE B. O. E. SAVING THE TWO AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS ASSOCIATED WITH IT. BUT LOOK TO INCREASE AND NOT DECREASE THE FINDING OF THE P. O. E. SO THEY CAN ADEQUATELY PERFORM THESE CRITICAL CRITICAL FUNCTIONS IN CONCLUSION VERY BRIEFLY. TO THOSE WHO WILL QUICKLY SWEEP AWAY THE BOP ENTRANCE FOR ITS POWER TO AN ELECTED. INDIVIDUALS I RESPECTFULLY SUBMIT THAT THEY HAVE NOT HAVE NOT. ADEQUATELY CONSIDERED THE NEGATIVE IMPACT ON TAXPAYERS AND THE SUBSTANTIAL DETRIMENT WILL HAVE TO OVERSIGHT THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU FOR COMMENTS. LAST CALL FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS LAST CALL. ALL RIGHT WE LIKE YOU BETTER BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE BUT TO BE ABLE TO MAKE ANY CLOSING COMMENTS -- I AGAIN WANT TO SAY HOW GRATEFUL WE HAVE BEEN TO BE ABLE. TO CONNECT IN WORK IN PARTNERSHIP WITH SENATOR DRAWS SO AND HER BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR A WORK MA'AM AND PLEASE FORESHORES -- I ALSO WANT TO THANK EVERYONE WHO WAS HERE. FROM YOUR INDIVIDUAL POINT OF VIEW FROM YOUR PAST EXPERIENCES OF DECADES AGO TO YOUR CURRENT EXPERIENCES -- FROM ORGANIZATIONS THAT REPRESENT STAFF AND EMPLOYEES WHO WHO DO THE WORK OF THE ASSESSORS ALL OF YOU I THINK IT'S BEEN A REALLY IMPORTANT TO HEAR IN ONE HEARING. IN THIS MEETING FROM ALL OF YOU. I'VE HEARD -- FROM YOU THAT WE NEED TO OF THE BOARD THAT THESE ARE VERY IMPORTANT TO THE PUBLIC -- DIFFERENT SECTORS OF OUR PUBLIC -- TO PROTECT THE OF THE STAFF THAT WORK SO HARD TO DELIVER THE SERVICES TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR PUBLIC KNOWS ABOUT ANY OF THESE CHANGES -- AND THAT THERE WELL INFORMED SO THAT WE DON'T TAKE STEPS WITHOUT INFORMING THE PUBLIC SO. THERE'S MANY MORE ISSUES THAT YOU BROUGHT UP AND I JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU AND APPRECIATED THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH MADAM CHAIR AND AGAIN THANK YOU FOR ALL YOUR WORK I WANT. TO TAKE A MOMENT JUST TO SAY IF YOU THINK YOU WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO MISTER GORE NOW TO MY LEFT. WHO IS THE CHIEF CONSULTANT WITH GOVERNANCE AND FINANCE AND I WANNA SAY THANK YOU TO THE GENTLEMAN TO MY RIGHT MR STEPPING SHOP? WHO RUNS ALL ISSUES OF BUDGET FOR THE STATE SENATE AND HAS A BIT OF A STRESSFUL JOB -- SO -- VERY GRATEFUL SIR THANK YOU VERY MUCH BOTH YOU FOR THE COLLABORATION AND THE WORK. WE WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO THE CONTROLLER AND THE BORDER OFFICER FOR BEING HERE TODAY AND TO OUR EXPERT PANEL. WE WORKED HARD TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE VOICES OF ALL SIDES ON THIS ISSUE. THE REASON WHY WE WANTED TO BE A DO THAT HERE TWO DAYS THIS HAS SIGNIFICANT CONSEQUENCES FOR THE TAXPAYERS OF CALIFORNIA. IN OUR NUMBER ONE GOAL IS TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE A FORUM -- HERE IN THIS INITIAL HEARING ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE. WOULD LIKE TO TALK ABOUT SOME NEXT STEPS -- WE'RE GONNA HAVE INDIVIDUAL CONVERSATIONS HERE IN THE WEEKS AND MONTHS TO COME WITH THE BOARD OF A BOARD OF EQUALIZATION AS WELL AS THE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE. AND ALL OF THOSE STAKEHOLDERS YOU HEARD FROM TODAY -- AND IN ADDITION MANY MORE IN THE WEEKS AND MONTHS AHEAD. WE WILL BE HOLDING A SECOND HEARING WITH -- OFA IN THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TAX AND FEE ADMINISTRATION. LOOKING BACK AT THEIR TWENTY FOUR PROBABLY BY THE TIME WE GET THERE TWENTY FOUR MONTHS AND HOW THAT TRANSITION HAS BEEN ADVANCING. END. THIS CONVERSATION IS GOING TO CONTINUE -- AS WE ALL KNOW IS BECAUSE THERE IS LEGISLATION THAT FOCUS ON THIS. AND THERE IS NOT MANY AS FAR AS I AM AWARE OF WHAT MAY OR IF ANYTHING MAYBE MOVING THIS YEAR ON THE STATE SENATE SIDE. AND IT SURE WOMAN AND I WILL CONTINUE TO BE IN TOUCH I AS WE MOVE FORWARD. AGAIN THANK YOU SO MUCH THIS IS JUST BEGINNING WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU HERE IN THE MONTHS TO COME. THIS OVERSIGHT INFORMATIONAL HEARING IS ADJOURNED
