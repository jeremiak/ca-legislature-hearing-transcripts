OKAY READY GO HERE. LET'S GO AHEAD AND START. FIRST WE'RE FROM THE L. L. GOOD MORNING MORNINGS CAROLINE'S MY NAME IS CAROLYN CHIU FROM LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE HOPEFULLY YOU HAVE A COPY OF OUR HAND UP BEFORE YOU FOR THOSE WATCHING REMOTELY IT'S ALSO AVAILABLE ON OUR WEBSITE AT LA JOH DOT CA DOT GOV UNDER THE MAYOR REVISION BUTTON AT THE TOP OF THE SCREEN. TURNING FIRST PAIR MANY ASKED US TO GIVE AN UPDATE ON THE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE CLAIMS TO DATE. IN PARTICULAR CALIFORNIA HAS EXPERIENCED AN UNPRECEDENTED INCREASE IN YOU AYE CLAIMS SINCE THE ONSET OF THE PANDEMIC. NATIONAL AND STATE EMERGENCY IS AND STAY AT HOME ORDERS. ROUGHLY THREE POINT SIX MILLION CALIFORNIANS RECEIVING YOU AYE BENEFITS AND THE STATE HAS PAID TWELVE BILLION DOLLARS TO THE INDIVIDUAL SO FAR. THE STATE TRUST FIVE BECAME INSOLVENT SEVERAL WEEKS AGO THIS ALSO HAPPENED DURING THE GREAT RECESSION THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PROVIDES LOANS TO THE STATE WHEN THIS OCCURRED. SO FAR THE GOVERNMENT HAS ADVANCED THE STATE ONE POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN LOANS. THESE LOANS ARE INTEREST FREE THROUGH THE END OF THE CALENDAR YEAR. AS PART OF THE MAYOR VISION THE ADMINISTRATION HAS REQUESTED INCREASED EXPENDITURE AUTHORITY FOR THE U. I. AT FUND OF THIRTY EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS OF WHICH THIRTY FOUR BILLION OLLARS ARE FEDERAL FUNDS TO FIND THE- TEMPORARY SIX HUNDRED DOLLAR PER WEEK INCREASE IN YOU I BENEFITS. EIGHT EXTENSION OF. WEEKS OF YOU I BENEFITS AND THE BENEFIT THE NEW BUT THE NEW EXCUSE ME PANDEMIC UNEMPLOYMENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAM PROVIDED BY CONGRESS. THE SECOND PAGE THIS GIVES YOU A SHORT UPDATE ON THE EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT WHICH ADMINISTERS THE U. I. FACT CLAIMS PROCESS. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT MADE ADDITIONAL ADMINISTRATIVE FUNDS AVAILABLE AS PART OF ITS CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE. THE STATE IS TO RECEIVE TO AYE INSTALLMENTS OF THESE ADDITIONAL ADMINISTRATIVE FUNDS BOTH FIFTY NINE MILLION DOLLARS THE STATE HAS RECEIVED THE FIRST OF THE IT. IT'S BEEN USED TO PAY FOR CALL CENTERS VENDOR ACOSTA SET UP THE NEW YOU WHY PROGRAMS STAFF OVERTIME AND REDIRECTED STAFF SALARIES. THROUGH THE COURSE OF THE PANDEMIC SO FAR EDT HAS REDIRECTED FOURTEEN HUNDRED STAFF FROM WITHIN ITS OWN DEPARTMENT AND ACROSS THE REST TO ASSIST IN YOU AYE CLAIMS PROCESSING. EIGHTY ALSO PROPOSE AS AN ADDITIONAL SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHTY PER AT POSITIONS AS PART OF THE MAYOR VISION TO DEAL WITH THE INCREASE IN YOUR LIFE CLAIMS. IF POSITIONS WOULD BE FEDERALLY FUNDED UNDER THE EXISTING PROGRAM IN WHICH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PAYS THE BASIC ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS OF THE U. I. PROGRAM. DESPITE THE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES PROVIDED THERE CONTINUE TO BE CONCERNS REGARDING EDC EIGHTY DAYS CAPACITY TO ADMINISTER THE U. I. PROGRAM. UNDER NORMAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS EDT WOULD BE ABLE TO PROVIDE ABOUT 80% OF FIRST BENEFIT PAYMENTS WITHIN THREE WEEKS. AT THE SUBCOMMITTEE DOES THERE'VE BEEN REPORTS ABOUT INDIVIDUALS HAVING TROUBLE ACCESSING EDT AND RECEIVING THEIR BENEFITS IN A TIMELY FASHION. WE UNDERSTAND THAT EDT STOP- ARE AVAILABLE FOR YOUR QUESTIONS ON THIS MATTER. TURNING TO THE THIRD PAGE PAID FAMILY LEAVE. ARE UNDER EXISTING LAW EMPLOYERS WITH FIFTY EMPLOYERS ARE MORE MUST PROVIDE TWELVE WEEKS OF JOB PROTECTED FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE BENEFITS. IN ADDITION EMPLOYERS WITH TWENTY EMPLOYEES OR MORE MUST PROVIDE TWELVE WEEKS OF JOB PROTECTED LEAVE FOR CHILD BONDING. AS PARTISAN AS PART OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED TO EXTEND THESE JOB AT PROTECTIONS TO ALL BUSINESSES REGARDLESS OF SIZE. PACIFIC WE BUSINESSES WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE TWELVE WEEKS OF JOB PROTECTED LEAVE FOR ANY SITUATIONS COVERED BY THE STATE'S PAID FAMILY LEAVE. LOOK AT THE GOVERNOR ALSO PROPOSED ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN GRANTS TO BUSINESSES FOR JOB REFER BACK EMPLOYEE RETRAINING DUE TO THESE ADDITIONAL LEAVE BENEFITS. TURNING TO PAY FOR HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS THIS CHART WALK THROUGH THE CHANGES IN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IN THESE AREAS. I'LL START WITH THE NEW PROPOSALS AND MAY. SPECIFICALLY THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR PROJECT ROOM KEY EITHER FEDERAL FUNDS PROVIDED THROUGH THE COURT CORONAVIRUS RELIEF FUND. OF THE SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS WOULD BE PROVIDED TO PURCHASE THE HOTELS THAT HAVE BEEN YEARS THROUGH AT THE EXISTING PRODUCT ROOM KEEP- AT PROGRAM. REMAINING HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS WOULD GO TOWARDS REPAYING THE STATE AND LOCAL RENTS FOR COST ALREADY INCURRED. TO RESPOND TO THE BED A MARGIN CA AMONG THE HOMELESS POPULATION. IN ADDITION THE GOVERNOR CONTINUE A PROPOSES TO CONTINUE AT THE EXPANSION OF THE STATE'S LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDIT FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN THE BUDGET YEAR. HOWEVER THREE EARLIER GIVEN TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS EXPANSION IT'S AFTER OF ITS REVENUES. THE REST OF. PACK UP THROUGH PROPOSES WITH JOHN JOHN FROM JANUARY OR CHANGE FROM PRIOR YEARS. IN PARTICULAR THE ADMINISTRATION WITHDRAWS ITS PROPOSAL FOR SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS. IN ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT. ADDRESS THE- AS- IT ALSO WITH US IT'S TEN MILLION DOLLAR PROPOSAL TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. TO COMPLY WITH THE STATE'S NEW HOUSING LAWS. OUR NUMBER VERSIONS THE ADMINISTRATION ALSO PROPOSES IN PARTICULAR THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES TO WITHDRAW TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE MODERATE INCOME HOUSING PROGRAM PROVIDED IN LAST YEAR BUDGET. AND RIVER ABOUT HALF OF THE FUNDING PROVIDED FOR THE INFO INFRASTRUCTURE OP PROGRAM RIGHT AT LAST. LASTLY THE UNMET. SISTER I. WHICH UPPER PULL BACK ALL FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE HOUSING NAVIGATOR PROGRAM. THE LAST TWO ITEMS ON THIS CHART HAVE TO DO WITH SPECIAL FUND LOANS AND TRANSFERS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES AS PART OF ITS EFFORT TO DEAL WITH THE DETERIORATING GENERAL FUND CONDITION. IT DOESN'T HURT FROM A VERY OF DIFFERENT HOUSING RELATED PROGRAMS. TURNING TO THE NEXT PAGE WE HIGHLIGHT A FEW QUESTIONS FOR LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION. UP PARTICULARLY ABOUT ROOM KEY I'LL HIGHLIGHT A FEW OF THEM HOW WOULD LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN THE FACILITIES WHAT SORT OF SERVICES WITH A BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE INDIVIDUALS RESIDING IN THE- ALONG WITH INDIVIDUALS BE ABLE TO STANDING. WHAT SORT OF OVERSIGHT WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND STATE HAVE OF HOW LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE UTILIZING THESE RESOURCES PURCHASED BY THE STATE. PAGE SIX EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION. THE GOVERNOR'S JANUARY BUDGET PROPOSED INCREASE EMPLOYEE NON RETIREMENT BENEFIT IN PLAY COMPENSATION BY ONE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TO IMPLEMENT ALL OF THE PROVISIONS OF THE EXISTING MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING WITH THE STATE'S BARGAINING. THE MAYOR VISION IT. IN DOLLARS TO PAY FOR INCREASES IN HEALTH PREMIUMS AND SOME OF THESE PAY INCREASES HOWEVER THE MAYOR VISION ALSO PROPOSES TO REDUCE EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION BY A POINT EIGHT BILLION. THE ASSOCIATED WITH TO- IS ROUGHLY EQUIVALENT TO FURLOUGH DAYS PER MONTH FOR STATE EMPLOYEES. THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES HOWEVER TO ACHIEVE THESE SAVINGS THROUGH COLLECTIVE BARGAINING WITH THE STATE'S BARGAINING UNITS. TURNING TO PAGE SEVEN FOR APARTMENTS WE AGREE THAT COLLECTIVE BARGAINING IS THE PREFERRED METHOD FOR ACHIEVING THIS THINGS. AT FOUR AM FOR ACHIEVING SAVINGS AT. FROM IMPOSING EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION REDUCTIONS HOPEFULLY THAT WILL HELP MAINTAIN THE RELATIONS BETWEEN THE STATE'S BARGAINING UNITS AND THE STATE. WE ALSO WITH THE LEGISLATURE ADVISE THE ADMINISTRATION EMBARKING BARGAINING UNITS TO USE ALTERNATIVE OTHER THAN FOR LAWS TO ACHIEVE THESE SAVINGS AS FOLLOWS HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR THE STATE'S LONG TERM LIABILITIES. TURNING TO PAGE EIGHT ON PENSIONS. AT THE SUBCOMMITTEE WILL RECALL THE STATE MADE NEARLY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS TO CALPERS AND CAL STIRS LAST YEAR AS PART OF THE BUDGET. IF SUPPLEMENTAL MEN'S FOR OVER AND ABOVE WHAT THE STATE WOULD NORMALLY BE REQUIRED TO CONTRIBUTE TO THESE PENSION SYSTEMS. THERE ALSO WAS A PLAN TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS TOTALING FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO CAL HERS OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS AS PART OF THE JANUARY BUDGET THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED TO ACCELERATE HE- IN MAY THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES TO REPURPOSE ALMOST. THE ENTIRETY OF THE FIVE BILLION DOLLARS FROM SOME SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS DISAPPOINTING PAYMENTS FOR BOTH CALPERS AND CASTERS. BY TURNING THESE PAYMENTS AND DISAPPOINTING PAYMENTS IT WOULD REDUCE STATE COSTS AND SCHOOL AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE AFFECT US FOR REQUIRED PENSION PAYMENTS FOR THE NEXT FEW. IN ADDITION THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES TO SUSPEND CASTERS ABILITY TO INCREASE THE STATE'S CONTRIBUTION RATE FOR THAT PENSION SYSTEM FOR THE NEXT THREE YEARS. IN TERMS OF OUR COMMENTS THE ADMINITRATION'S PROPOSAL DOES ACHIEVE SOME SHORT TERM FIX SOME SHORT TERM SAVINGS BY TURNING THE SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS INTO THE PLANTING PAYMENTS HOWEVER. STATE COST BURKE WOULD BE A LIKELY HIGHER IN THE LONG TERM. WE ALSO HAVE CONCERNS WITH THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL TO SUSPEND MCALISTER'S RATE RATE INCREASE AUTHORITY AND WORRY THAT IT WOULD WEAKEN THE FUNDING PLAN ACHIEVED BY THE STATE AND TWENTY FOURTEEN. PENSIONS SOME. PAGE NINE GOVERNMENT REORGANIZATION AND RESTRUCTURING. AT THE CHAIR NOTED THERE ARE A NUMBER OF A PROPOSALS FOR RESTRUCTURING AND NEW DEPARTMENTS AS PART OF THE GOVERNOR'S JANUARY BUDGET SOME OF THESE CONTINUE INTO MAY. IN PARTICULAR IN JANUARY THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED A NEW DEPARTMENT OF BETTER JOBS AND HIGHER WAGES. THIS WOULD CONSOLIDATE ITS ACTIVITIES WITHIN THE LABOR AGENCY. THE GOVERNOR HAD BUDGETED TWO POINT. IN ONE TIME RESOURCES TO AN EXECUTIVE TEAM. THE MINARET REVISION WITHDRAWS THE FOR A THE FUNDING FOR THE NEW DEPARTMENT BUT DOES CONTINUE THE PROPOSAL TO FORM THE NEW DEPARTMENT. TERMS OF OUR COMMENTS GIVEN THE CURRENT-WORKLOAD EDT RELATED TO THE ON PRESIDENT AND UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE CLAIMS INCLUDING RAPPER RAPID IMPLEMENTATION OF NEW FEDERAL PROGRAMS. IT'S UNCLEAR WHETHER THE LABOR AGENCY AND DEPARTMENT STAFF COULD DEDICATE AND RESOURCES NEEDED. AT THIS TIME. MOVING TO THE CANNABIS LICENSING DEPARTMENT IN JANUARY THE GOVERNOR HAD EXPRESSED INTENT TO CONSOLIDATE THE CAMP CANNABIS RELATED LICENSING FUNCTIONS OF THE BUREAU OF CANNABIS CONTROL PERMIT. OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE AND THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC IN NEW DEPARTMENT OF CANADA TROLL STARTING IN THE BUDGET YEAR. IN THE MAYOR VISION THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES TO DELAY THIS CONSOLIDATION UNTIL NEXT YEAR. FIND THE CONCEPT OF THE CONSOLIDATION TO BE PROMISING WE FIND THAT THE DELAY ALSO IS REASONABLE GIVEN CURRENT CONDITIONS. MOVE TO THE DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS OVERSIGHT. THREE NAMING THE DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS OVERSIGHT TO THE DEPARTMENT OF PROTECTION AND INNOVATION AS WELL AS EXTENDING ITS AUTHORITIES INCLUDING AND ABILITY TO TAKE ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS AGAINST FINANCIAL SERVICE PROVIDERS FOR UNFAIR DECEPTIVE OR ABUSIVE ACTS OR PRACTICES AND REGISTER PROVIDERS OF CONSUMER IT'LL START AS- I HAD. WAS TEN POINT MILLION DOLLARS SPECIAL FUND FOR THIS NEW EXPANDED DEPARTMENTS. THE MERIDEN CONTINUES THIS PROPOSAL HOWEVER IT DOES MAKE THE FUNDING CONTENT CONTINGENT ON THE LEGISLATURE ADOPTING THE STATUTORY CHANGES. WE RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDER THIS PROPOSAL THROUGH THE LEGISLATIVE POLICY PROCESS TO ENSURE ITS ABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY SCREWED NEITHER CHANGE X. SCRUTINIZE THE CHANGES AND ALIGN THE FUNDING WITH ANY WITH THE FINAL SET OF RESPONSIBILITIES. LASTLY THE SEISMIC SAFETY COMMISSION IN JANUARY THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED TO TRANSFER THE SEISMIC SAFETY COMMISSION TO THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES FOR ROUGHLY ONE MILLION DOLLARS. ACOSTA ROUGHLY MORE MET. THE GOVERNOR CONTINUES THIS PURPOSE AT THIS TRANSFER PROPOSAL IN MAY BUT THE FUNDING AMOUNT IS REDUCED BY ABOUT HALF. WE AGAIN REMARKS AND DELAYING THIS DECISION TO NEXT YEAR TO OPEN TO ALLOW FOR MORE OPPORTUNITY TO WEIGH THE TRADE OFFS. OTHER COULD BE SOME EFFICIENCY. IT DOES REDUCE THE SEISMIC SAFETY COMMISSION'S INDEPENDENCE WHICH HAS BEEN OF AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT FOR THE LEGISLATURE. TURNING TO PAGE ELEVEN WRITING IN SEARCH OTHER ISSUES STATE OFFICE BUILDING. THE MAIN REVISION WITHDRAWS A PROPOSAL FOR ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED AND TWENTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS IN LEASE REVENUE BONDS FUNDING FOR THE DESIGN BUILD PHASE RENOVATIONS OF THE BATES SENT. JESSE UNDER NATURAL RESOURCES BUILDINGS TO ALLOW THE STATE TO REEVALUATE ITS OFFICE AT SPACE NEEDS IN A LONG REASONABLE YES NO THE GENERAL FUND AND THE VALUE OF THE PROPOSED REEVALUATION. SIMILARLY FOR THE STATE PROJECT INFRASTRUCTURE FIND THE MAY WERE VERSION AB PROPOSES TO TRANSFER ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE STATE PROJECT INFRASTRUCTURE FIND ACT THE GENERAL FUND. THESE FUNDS HAD BEEN LOCATED FOR THE WILL ANNEXED CHECKED AND NOT BE FUNDED WITH WE SPENDING BOND FUNDING. WHEN THE CHANGE IT OFTEN CONDITION WE FIND THAT PROPOSAL IS REASONABLE. TURNING TO PAGE TWELVE THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS. THE MAYOR VISION PROPOSAL IS TO BORROW ABOUT SIX HUNDRED AND SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS FROM NOT ABLE BOARD FOR A SPECIAL FUNDS. IN GENERAL THE FUNDS IDENTIFIED BY THE MINISTRY TO BORROW FROM. A LIKELY WOULD BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THE LOANS AND THEN IN THE NEAR TERM. IN SOME CASES HOWEVER. CAMPER THE FUNDS ABILITY TO SUPPORT ADDITIONAL ACTIVITIES IN THE FUTURE. SHOULD THE LEGISLATURE WHICH TO CONSIDER A DIFFERENT MIX OF OUR OF BORROWING WE WOULD BE HAPPY TO ASSIST. MOVING TO DC A FEE INCREASES THE MAYOR VERSION ALSO PROPOSES TO INCREASES INCREASED FEES FOR FIVE OR TEN BUREAUS. AS PART OF THE MARRIAGE AND- WELL THE FEE INCREASES APPEAR NECESSARY AND ARE CURRENTLY SUPPORTED BY THE COMMISSION FEET STUDIES. THESE TYPES OF INCREASES ARE TYPICALLY CONSIDERED THROUGH THE POLICY PROCESS RATHER THAN THE BUDGET. MOVING TO PAGE THIRTEEN. ELECTIONS THE GOVERNOR ISSUED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER EARLIER THIS YEAR THAT REQUIRES ALL COUNTIES TO CONDUCT VOTE BY MAIL BALLOTS IN PERSON VOTING WOULD BE RESTRICTED TO A CERTAIN OF INDIVIDUALS WITH CERTAIN LIKE THOSE. PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES NEED A DISTANCE TO VOTE. THE MAYOR VETERAN DOES NOT PROPOSE ANY FUNDING FOR COUNTIES TO HELP THEM WITH THIS TAX. WE FIND THAT COUNTIES ARE VERY LIKELY TO NEED ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO CONDUCT A PREDOMINATELY VOTE BY MAIL ELECTION. MOREOVER GIVEN THE REVENUE LOSS TO STAND BY COUNTY IS AS A RESULT OF THE PANDEMIC INDUCED RECESSION AND THE STATE'S CLEAR INTEREST IN WELL ADMINISTERED ELECTIONS. WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDER PROVIDE PROVIDING FUNDING TO COUNTY GOVERNMENTS FOR ELECTIONS ADMINISTRATION. IT COULD BE PROVIDED THROUGH LOW INTEREST LOANS ARE MATCHING ON A MATCHING BASIS AS IT'S BEEN DONE IN YEARS PAST. MOVIE VETERANS HOMES THE MAYOR VISION PROPOSES TO CLOSE THE BARSTOW VETERANS HOME AT A NET COST OF TWO POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND. BUT WITH ANNUAL SAVINGS OF FOURTEEN MILLION DOLLARS ONCE THE CLOSURE IS COMPLETE. WELL WE FIND THAT THE PROPOSAL HAS MERIT IN CONCEPT. GIVEN THAT THE FACILITY HAS HAVING CHALLENGES AND IS ONLY OPERATING AT HALF CAPACITY THE DEPARTMENT HAS NOT YET FULLY ENGAGE WITH STAKEHOLDERS TO DEVELOP A CLOSURE PLAN AND RESIDENT TRANSFERS. GIVEN THE POINT FOR POSTPONING ALTHOUGH WE'RE NOT FOREGO ANY SAVINGS THE LEGISLATURE COULD REJECT THE PROPOSAL AND INSTEAD POTS ADMISSIONS INTO BARSTOW AND DIRECT THE DEPARTMENT TO DEVELOP A CLOSURE PLAN OVER THE NEXT YEAR. I IN TERMS OF OTHER CANNABIS RELATED PROPOSALS THE MERE VISION INCLUDES FOR A HUNDRED FORTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS IN MONTHLY ONGOING FUNDS TO THE CANNABIS CONTROL FUND. TO BE SIXTIES C. S. C. D. F. A. AND DPH FOR CANNABIS ACTIVITIES AS IN PAST YEARS THE MAYOR THE BUDGET ALSO- IS PROPOSED TO INCLUDE UNLIMITED AUGMENTATION SO THE ADMINISTRATION. FOR LICENSING AND FOURTH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SUBJECT TO JAIL BC NOTIFICATION. THE MAYOR HAS BEEN ALSO PROPOSE A STATUTORY CHANGE CHANGES TO SHELVE SWORN OFFICERS FROM DC IS DIVISION OF INVESTIGATION TO BCC AND DELAYS A JANUARY PROPOSAL CHANGE THE POINT OF COLLECTION FOR CANNABIS TAXES. GIVEN THE UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE LEVEL OF FUNDING NEEDED WE RECOMMEND PROVIDING FUNDING FOR BCC CDF MD PHD ON A ONE YEAR RATHER THE ON GOING BASIS. WE ALSO WRECKED REJECTED ABOUT THE PROPOSED BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE. AT TO PROVIDE UNLIMITED AUGMENTATIONS OF THAT IT DOES NOT PROVIDE THE LEGISLATURE SUFFICIENT OVERSIGHT OVER THE DEPARTMENT GETS. WE FIND IT'S REASONABLE TO SHAPESHIFT SWORN OFFICERS TO BCC AND DELAYING. CHANGING THE POINT OF COLLECTION FOR CANNABIS TAXES UNTIL NEXT YEAR. ON THE LAST PAGE FIFTEEN REVENUE PROPOSALS. THE MAYOR VISION INCLUDES TWO SIGNIFICANT REVENUE SOLUTIONS TO ADDRESS THE BUDGET PROBLEM SPECIFICALLY THE MEROVINGIAN WOULD LIMIT THE USE OF CREDIT THAT IS- BUSINESSES COULD ONLY USE UP TO FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN CREDITS TO AGAINST THEIR TAXABLE INCOME. AND IT ALSO SUSPEND THE USED. FOR READING LOSSES THIS IS ONE BUSINESSES CAN. OFFSET THEIR TAX LIABILITY WITH LOSSES THAT THEY HAVE EXPERIENCED IN PRIOR YEARS. IF PROPOSALS GENERALLY SHIFT THE TIMING OF PAYMENTS FOR BUSINESSES FROM FUTURE YEARS INTO THE BUDGET YOU'RE- RATHER THAN INCREASE TAXES OVER THE LONG TERM IN TOTAL. IN MANY ASIAN ESTIMATES THAT THESE TWO CHANGES WOULD INCREASE REVENUE BY A TOTAL OF FOUR POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS. WE BELIEVE THESE TWO PROPOSALS ARE REASONABLE STARTING POINT FOR DELIBERATION. BUT WE ALSO BUT WE HAVE LOWER F. THROUGH THE TERMS OF THE AMOUNT OF REVENUE THAT WE EXPECT TO BE RAISED IN THE ADMINISTRATION. SPECIFICALLY THAT THE TOTAL REVENUE RATES WOULD LIKELY BE BETWEEN TWO POINT. THREE POINT SIX DOLLARS. WE ALSO HAVE SUGGESTIONS ABOUT HOW TO CHANGE THE PROPOSAL TO TREAT BUSINESSES MORE EQUITABLY. THERE ALSO ARE ARE SOME OTHER SMALLER REVENUE PROPOSALS INCLUDED ON THIS CHART THAT THE GOVERNOR PROPOSAL PROPOSES AND ALSO NOTE THAT THE GOVERNOR AND MAINTAINS HIS VAPE TAX PROPOSAL. FOR JANUARY IN THE MAYOR AND- THAT IS NOT INCLUDED ON THE CHART. THE BOTTOM HALF OF THIS FIGURE LAYS OUT SOME OF OUR ALTERNATIVE REVENUE SOLUTIONS I WOULD BE HAPPY TO TALK FOR ANY OF THOSE TO THE COMMITTEE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. WITH THAT I CONCLUDE- MY PREPARED AND HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS. THANK YOU ANY COMMENTS FROM FINANCE. MINOR ONE ZERO FOR OUR PHONE PARTICIPANTS.

UP AND LOOK AT A SKILLED FIFTH. UP TO ENSURE THE CONSISTENCY OF ANSWERS- AMONG ALL THAT. ASIAN BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT HAS BEEN AN ISSUE FOR SOME CLAIMANTS THAT SOMETIMES IF CALLED AND OF GOTTEN DIFFERENT ANSWERS. SO WE'RE LOOKING- WORKING WITH THE VENDOR TO DO HOW ARE CALL CENTERS. IN ORDER TO BETTER RESPOND TO OUR CUSTOMERS WE'VE ALSO- INCREASE THE TRAINING- FOR OUR- NEW. OUR NEW AGENTS SO THEY CAN HANDLE UP 272% OF ALL CALLS RIGHT NOW- SAVING EXPERIENCE YOU AYE CLAIM PROCESS THERE. YOU HAVE ALL THE MORE COMPLEX CALLED. EVEN THOUGH THE HOURS ARE STILL THERE FROM EIGHT AM TO EIGHT PM I'VE BEEN TOLD THAT THE CLAIM HOTLINE ONLY OPERATES FROM EIGHT AM TILL TWELVE NOON. IN THE ALWAYS EAT THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE LINE WHICH DEALS WITH PETER FILLING OUT THE FORMS PETER ISSUES. GOES REST THE TIME IS THAT CHIU THE QUICKLY MAKE CLAIMS FROM EIGHT O'CLOCK TILL TWELVE PM WHICH IS A SPELL FOR HOURS I'M- WHAT. IT I'M ARE A EIGHT LINE AS PRIMARILY FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND IT DOES NOW. PROVIDE SOME LEVEL OF CLAIM INFORMATION. BUT IF A CUSTOMER NEEDS TO HAVE THEIR- THEIR YOU APPLICATION FILED OVER THE PHONE. IT IS ELEVATED OR ESCALATED. INTO FOR THE MOST PART DURING THIS PANDEMIC THE CLAIM HOTLINE IS ONLY BEEN OPEN FOR HOURS IS THAT WOULD THAT BE CORRECT. UP WELL WHEN WE STARTED THE EIGHT TO EIGHT WHICH WAS WHAT- AND MID APRIL- WE'VE HAD THAT ESCALATION ABILITY THAT THE ENTIRE TIME- FOR THOSE. FOR THOSE CLAIMS THAT ABSOLUTELY NEEDED TO SPEAK TO. A REPRESENTATIVE IN ORDER TO HAVE THEIR CLAIM FILED ON THEIR BEHALF. OF THOSE ARE RELATED. WHAT ARE SOME OF THE SAME FOLKS THAT SWITCH OVER IT AT TWELVE O'CLOCK THE SAME FOLKS THE SAME CALL TAKERS AT SWITCH FROM THE CLAIM OUTLINED THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE SO IN ESSENCE THEY DIDN'T HAVE A CROSS DUTIES. SO OUR CLAIM PROCESSORS HAVE- I HAVE ALWAYS WORK THAT WAY- WE HAVE BEEN USEFUL- PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC. BETWEEN EIGHT AND TWELVE THEY'VE BEEN ON THE PHONES AND THEN FROM THE PRESS THE DAY ON IS WITH WHEN THEY PROCESS ALL THE- SO. UNDER VERY HIGH TECHNICAL LEAD. OF SO THAT THAT WAS FOUND AT THE MOST. WAY IN ORDER TO PROCESS AS MANY CLAIMS AS AS WE CAN. MR GLORIA THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN IT IN THIS ORDER PLEASE STAND BY BECAUSE I THESE ARE QUESTIONS FOR YOU AND YOUR YOUR COLLEAGUES BY PJ MISTREATMENT CHANCE TO BE HERE THE COMMITTEE TO ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT MY CONSTITUENTS OBVIOUSLY- I HEARD YOU TALK ABOUT THE ADDITIONAL STAFF IT'S COMING ON LINE IN THE MEN'S TO PURGE THE CALLS. YOU HAVEN'T. FOR HOW CAN EXPECT TO BE ABLE TO GET OF APPLICATIONS FOR RATHER THAN JUST REPORTED THE CALL CENTER WELL WE'LL BRING IN FOR THE NEXT SIX HUNDRED- ONLINE THEY SHOULD BE EXCITEMENT CHEN. AND WE'RE GETTING READY ALTHOUGH WE'RE GETTING READY TO HIRE TOTAL EIGHTEEN HUNDRED PEOPLE RIGHT NOW- IN ORDER TO PROPERTY CLAIM IS AN ADDRESS THE ISSUES THAT I THINK I'VE- EARLIER. UP AND WERE AROUND A GOING INTO ANOTHER STE SECOND BIG HUGE FIRE TO- BE SURE THAT WE CAN ADDRESS ALL THE ISSUES. OF WE BELIEVE THAT WITH THE FUNDING THAT'S COMING NEXT FISCAL YEAR THAT WILL HAVE PLENTY OF BUT IN ORDER TO. CONTINUE TO QUICKLY AMP UP- OUR SERVICES BOTH IN THE CALL FOR HER AS WELL AS WITH PROCESSING. SO THAT'S THAT'S WHERE WE'RE GOING SO- ARE HIRING RIGHT NOW WE SHOULD HAVE EVERYONE ON BOARD IN THE NEXT TWO WEEKS. EIGHTEEN HUNDRED AND THEN. LIKE I SAID RIGHT AROUND AND OTHER BIG THING OF. ASSISTANCE ABOUT ART AND CAL HR HAVE BEEN. I'M A VERY A GARAGE HIGHER. FIRING UP. TO UNDERSTAND THAT EIGHT IF YOU IF YOU CAN ONE STARTED WE WERE AT THE LOWEST AND THREE POINT STAFF WAS AT THAT SAME LEVEL. SO WE HAD TO TURN ON A DIME IN ORDER TO START PROCESSING CLAIMS. THAT INSTEAD OF TWO TO FIVE THOUSAND EVERY DAY UP TO I THINK OUR OUR HIGH STATE WAS TWO HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND A DAY. SO I THINK WITH THE SAME AMOUNT OF. SO I MEAN THAT'S OUR MAIN TEACHER WHAT WE'RE REALLY. RIGHT NOW IS TO. CONTINUE TO RAMP UP SIGNIFICANTLY- ADDRESS ALL TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS STREAMLINED OUR PROCESSES. WERE HITTING IT FROM THREE ANGLE- IMPROVE COMMUNICATIONS- IMPROVE OUR WEBSITE- WE PUT- A PANDEMIC- AT ALL WEBSITE. WITH DENSER FAQS THE SOONER SO AN ACUTE I'M SURE. THANK YOU AS- I AM SYMPATHETIC TO THE SITUATION THE DEPARTMENT FIND YOURSELVES AND I RECOGNIZE THAT JUST A COUPLE MONTHS AGO THERE WAS NOT A HUGE IF YOUR SERVICE IS. A THAT IS CHANGED RADICALLY I RECOGNIZE AT THE SAME TIME. PROBE OFFICE CHANGED DRAMATICALLY BECAUSE THE FEDERAL CARES THAT. BUT ULTIMATELY WHAT I THINK WE HAVE TO BE THINKING ABOUT GO FORWARD. AND SO THAT'S THE CLAIM. FOR PHONE CALL TO BE. IF YOU COUNT BEFORE FOR CLAIM SUPPORT TO BE GOING FROM EIGHT TO EIGHT AT THE CALL CENTER. I CAN'T GIVE YOU THAT DATE RIGHT NOW- AGAIN WE DO ALREADY HAVE THAT IT UP PEOPLE ARE ESCALATED IF THEY NEED ASSISTANCE DURING EIGHT TO EIGHT. SO IT'S NOT IT'S NOT THE DATE. IT'S NOT AVAILABLE WITH IT IT IS. BUT THE PRIMARILY USE FOR ASSISTANCE THAT WE DID INCREASE THE ACCESS SYSTEM ACCESS FOR ALL THE- AGENTS THAT WORK EIGHT TO EIGHT. AS WELL AS PROVIDE ADDITIONAL TRAINING. SO HOW THEY WERE WHEN THEY STARTED VERSUS HOW THEY ARE NOW IS MUCH DIFFERENT. UNDERSTOOD IT MAYBE YOU CAN GO BACK IF YOU CAN PROVIDE US SOME SORT OF TIME TO LET FOLKS. RIGHT NOW WILL CONSTITUENTS TELL. THEY CALL NUMBER. GO THE PHONE THREE. AND THEN THEY HUNG. IN I RECOGNIZE THAT YOU SAID YOU HAVE TO PASSED FOR GETTING THE PERCENT OF A CALL CARE WHEN THEY COME IN BUT MAN I IT'S NOT WHAT MY ALL. IF I CAN TO TRY TO ANOTHER PART OF BECAUSE MY ALL AND I I'M A CO OFFER BECAUSE THE FACT OF CENTERS FOR DE WHAT WE'RE FRESH BY IS THAT THE WE'RE TAKE ON THAT WAS WHICH IS OUR JOB WE DON'T HAVE A GOOD RISK TIME TERMS ARE ENCOURAGED ON BEHALF OF OUR CAN. HELLO CAN YOU SPEAK TO YOU HAVE. HI WE- ALL RIGHT IT WILL WHEN THIS WE THE FIRST OFF WITHOUT WITH CONSTITUENTS.

STARTING TODAY STARTING NEXT WEEK THAT WE JUST ADDED TWENTY MORE PEOPLE STORE UP TO FORTY FIVE NOW SO WE'RE HOPING TO GET THROUGH THE BACK LOT THE NEXT TO YOU KNOW COVER TWO THREE WEEKS. AND REALLY GET THINGS CAUGHT UP. ON OKAY SO THEN I RECOGNIZE THAT A BIG PART OF THIS CHALLENGE IS THE ANTIQUATED- INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEM THAT'S BEING USED ONE GETTING DONE TO IMPROVE TECH. SO THAT THAT MEANS THE BANK WE ARE HOLDING UP CATIONS CAN BE ACCEPTED I IN SOME FORMAT OTHER THAN NECK PAIN AFFECTS OUR OUR- CURRENTLY EXCEPT. UHHUH SO PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC. IN.

THANK YOU MISTER RIGHT AND ARE THE CHAIR- WE HAVE A COMMITTEE MEMBERS OF MY PAST QUESTIONS I'M HAPPY TO SEE MY TIME AND MAYBE COME BACK TO THE SO YOU'RE TO FIVE. IF WE ARE VICIOUS AT A TIME THANK YOU MISTER TO. THANK YOU HELLO ME FOR START BY. HAVE BEEN SERVING ON A BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE NOW FOR SIX YEARS AND I'VE NEVER BEEN TOLD UNTIL THIS HEARING. BY COLLEAGUES THAT THEY'RE JEALOUS THAT I SIT ON THIS COMMITTEE BECAUSE- I. ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT EDTA AT THE MOMENT. LET ME JUST START BY SAYING THAT- YOU KNOW AGAIN WE ALL APPRECIATE THE UNPRECEDENTED PLACER AND BUT I THINK WE'RE ALL EXPERIENCING INCREDIBLE FRUSTRATION BECAUSE NOT ONLY ARE OUR DISTRICT STAFF WORKING ROUND THE CLOCK NOT ONLY HAVE WE BEEN ABLE TO HAVE HAD TO- IT INSTANCE AND MANY OTHERS. PUSH OUR CAPITAL STAFF TO ALSO BUT THIS UP BUT IT SEEMS LIKE THERE ARE SOME A NUMBER OF DECISIONS THAT COULD BE MADE TO SORT OF ADDRESS THE SITUATION RIGHT NOW SALUTE. COUPLE QUESTIONS AT THE LAST BRIEFING FOR LATEST STAFF EDT SAID IF THEY WERE TO ANSWER THE CURRENT LEVEL CALLS YOU NEED. TWENTY EIGHT THOUSAND FOUR STEP. IN THEM TO A- SEVEN DAYS A WEEK RIGHT. OKAY SO I JUST WANNA SAY I LOVE THE FACT THAT WERE ABOUT TO GET I THINK EIGHTEEN HUNDRED STAFF AND MAYBE SOME MORE THAT WOULD MEAN WE WOULD HAVE ABOUT TO ADDRESS THE CHECK RIGHT OKAY JUST WANT TO. SIT THERE NOW. I ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT 73% OF YOUR CALLS. ARE SEEKING BASIC INFORMATION ABOUT THE STATUS OF CLAIMS. IT SEEMS TO US. THAT YOU SHOULD BE DEVOTING A LOT MORE TIME TRYING TO EDUCATE. CLAIMANTS FOR HELPING TO PROVIDE THEM WITH TOOLS TO PROVIDE BASIC INFORMATION. AND GET THAT YOU WANT TO HIRE PEOPLE THE FRONTLINE AND I SUPPORT THAT I WANT SUPPORT AS MUCH AS WE NEED AT THIS TIME. BUT IT IT'S A BIT BAFFLING TO SEE HOW IT IS THAT WE'RE NOT SPENDING TIME FOCUSING ON PROVIDING THAT. INFORMATION SO THAT WERE NOT ANSWERING THE SAME QUESTIONS OVER AND OVER AGAIN- AND GET. PERMISSION SO. YOU'RE DOING IN THAT REGARD. SO WE'VE GOT A LOT. BASS I'M- HAVE. OUR ONLINE VIEWERS WATCH WE'VE ALSO. DONE A WEB IN OUR- BOTH. HOUSES WE- RESERVE OKAY. WHAT MANY DIFFERENT. YOU WE ALSO HAVE A NEW BEEN. GUIDE TO HELP WALKS. THE PEOPLE UNDER. WHICH IS ON OUR- WEBSITE. DO THE PRESS. COMING PEOPLE THAT. I'VE DEEP DOWN BY TO ANSWER PEOPLE UNDER WE DONE WE'VE RAMPED UP ALL OUR SOCIAL MEDIA AT PROVIDING UPDATES. WE STARTED JUST THIS LAST WEEK- A PILOT FOR TEXTING MESSAGES OUT TO PEOPLE. THAT SAYS YOU KNOW YOUR PLANT WE RECEIVE YOUR CLAIM AND OKAY HERE'S YOUR FOR PAYMENT. I JUST STARTED IN THE LAST WEEK AND THAT IS GOING TO EXPAND. SO WE'RE VERY EXCITED ABOUT THAT BECAUSE THAT WILL KEEP PEOPLE INFORMED- WERE ALSO. OLD A CHAT BOT A COUPLE WEEKS AGO THAT PEOPLE CAN USE TO HELP TRY TO ANSWER THOSE BASIC QUESTIONS- AND WE CONTINUE TO LOOK AT EVERYTHING AND ANYTHING TO EXCESS- THE PUBLIC IN MAKING SURE THEY KNOW HOW TO NAVIGATE OR SYSTEM. AND I KNOW OF THIS IT IS VERY CHALLENGING BECAUSE YOU AYE PROGRAM IS COMPLEX AND THIS IS THE FIRST TIME MANY MANY PEOPLE ARE ON ARE UNEMPLOYED. AND IT'S THEIR FIRST- EXPERIENCE WITH THAT. SO EVERYTHING YOU CAN POSSIBLY DO TO MAKE IT EASIER TO- HOPEFULLY ANSWER THE QUESTIONS PEOPLE HAVE BEFORE THEY HAVE TO GO THROUGH THOROUGHLY FRUSTRATING EXPERIENCE TO TRY TO GET. THROUGH ONE AREA AND I KNOW OUR COLLEAGUES TOUCH ON THIS IS AROUND ID VERIFICATION WHICH- WE HAVE HAD CONSTITUENTS WHO HAD FOR FOUR WEEKS BEFORE THEY'RE EVEN NOTIFIED OF AN ID VERIFICATION ISSUE. AND THEN AND SOME OF THOSE CASES IT TAKES ANOTHER THREE WEEKS BEFORE THEIR ID'S BEEN VERIFIED AND IT SEEMS THAT A LOT OF THE- COULD PREVENTABLE YOU KNOW YOU HAVE A REVIEW PAGE TO PROP CONSTITUENTS. TO CHECK THAT INFORMATION SPEND CLEARLY- AT. ENTERED CORRECTLY. BUT WONDERING YOU KNOW REVIEW PAGES DIFFERENT FROM SAY POP UP WINDOW SOME SAY OF A- WARNING UP OF P. SEE THEIR A- ABOUT THE LAST AND PERSONAL. IF YOU THOUGHT ABOUT WAY IS. THIS TWEET THE RESPONSES SO THAT WE LET PEOPLE KNOW. THE YOU HIT THAT BUTTON YOU GOT A MAJOR EVERY. APPS CORRECT BECAUSE THAT IS CLEAR HANGING UP AN AWFUL RIGHT NOW. RIGHT AND WE DO HAVE THAT BILL TO THIS AND WE ENCOURAGE PEOPLE LOOK AT YOU KNOW WANTED IT ALL IN. TO GO BACK AND LOOK AT EVERYTHING AND- WE AND WE DO HAVE CHECKS AND BALANCES TO MAKE SURE IN OUR SYSTEM SO PEOPLE DON'T MAKE ERRORS BUT AT. UNFORCED LINK PEOPLE STILL CONTINUE TO MEDICARE'S- BUT IF YOU HAVE SPECIFIC SUGGESTIONS I YOU'LL PLEASE SEND MY WAY. AND WOULD LOVE TO TAKE A LOOK AT HIM AND SEE IF THERE'S ANYTHING WE CAN DO TO FINE TUNE OUR OUR SYSTEM. I THINK I THINK THIS. IS JUST JUST UP WINDOW OR SOME SORT OF WARNING BEFORE PEOPLE SUBMIT THEIR APPLICATIONS IF THEY GET IT ON. DRAMATIC RIGHT IDENTITY IS A PRESSURE POINT FOR US-RIGHT NOW- THAT'S ABOUT 1% OF ALL OF OUR CASES WE DO HAVE A BACKLOG BUT WE ARE MAKING SUBSTANTIAL EFFORTS TO- LIQUIDATE IN CLEAR AND GET CAUGHT UP ON THAT BACK LAW BECAUSE WE KNOW- WHEN WE STARTED WE THIRTEEN WILL NOT UNIT WE NOW HAVE TWO HUNDRED EIGHTEEN THAT I JUST TRAIN DIRECTED AND WE HAVEN'T. AND TRAIN. EIGHT SWEET BECAUSE WE WANT THAT WE KNOW THE CRITIC OF IT- UNFORTUNATELY YOU KNOW ALL CUSTOMERS GO THROUGH AN INITIAL AUTOMATED- IDENTITY REVIEW- BUT AS 3% KICK OUT OF FOR SECOND LEVEL REVIEW IF YOU KNOW THERE'S A SECURITY NUMBER DOESN'T MATCH OR THE BURDEN AT IT DOESN'T MATCH UP AND FROM THERE BASS FOR SPECIFIC DOCUMENTS- FROM FOLKS AND WE HAD ABOUT 70% OF THEM BACK AND THE OTHER THIRTY EIGHT IT'S EITHER THERE FRAUDULENT CLAIMS OR PEOPLE'S SITUATIONS OF CHANGE OR OR WHAT NOT. SO BUT BUT BUT IS OUR MAIN AND THEIR PRIMARY BACKLOG COOL AIR YEAH AND WE'RE HERE IT AND HITTING IT HARD- OUR OVERALL CLAIMS WE CONTINUE TO PROCESS WITHIN. THE THREE WEEKS- BUT THIS IS DEFINITELY A OUR PRESSURE POINT BUT WE'RE IT IS ALL IS ON DECK RIGHT NOW AROUND. THIS IDENTITY BECAUSE BEEN WAITING TOO LONG AND WE WERE BY THAT BUT WE NOW HAVE PEOPLE TRAINED. AT WHICH- DIRECTED AT TRAINED AND THEY'RE UP AND RUNNING AND LIKE I SAID WE HAVE NOW TWO HUNDRED EIGHTEEN WITH ANOTHER HUNDRED AND FIFTY. BEING TRAINED NEXT WEEK AND- LIKE I SAID PART OF THE- OVERALL HIRING OF THE EIGHTEEN BUT STAFF WILL INCREASE IN THIS AREA. AND WE'RE GONNA TURN AROUND AND DO ANOTHER HIRING- CAN WE'RE JUST GONNA CAN RAMP UP AND RAMP UP AND FULL WEEK IN SURE THAT. RIGHT NOW WE'RE YOU KNOW WE'RE MOVING PEOPLE AROUND JUST TO YOU KNOW KEEP UP THE BALLS IN THE AIR RIGHT BECAUSE WE HAD THE STAFF WE HAD EVEN THOUGH WILL BE RE DIRECTED HUNDRED AND HUNDREDS. STAFF FROM OTHER STATES. BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY WE HAVE TO EXPAND OUR CAPACITY SIGNIFICANTLY. AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE WORKING ON- AND WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF CALYX ARE. BECAUSE LIKE IT'S HOW MANY OF HOW MANY COBLE CODERS YOU HAVE AT THIS POINT. HOW MANY I WANT TO SAY FIFTEEN. OKAY TEAM IS OUT OF MY PUTS OUT A HALLMARK. I ONLY KNOW- ONLY GET THAT THE SYSTEM ITSELF- YOU KNOW. AT BECAUSE ARE INFLEXIBLE- WE HAD TO DO THINGS THE FINANCIALLY AND COULDN'T DO THEM CONCURRENTLY SUCH AS LIKE THE SIX HUNDRED DOLLAR STIMULUS PANT WE HAD TO DO FIRST AND THEN- PA YOU WAITED TO SECOND AND THEN- NEXT ON THE TWENTY SEVENTH WILL BE ROLLING OUT OF THE EXPECTATIONS. OF THE THIRTEEN WITH EXTENSIONS SO WE'RE VERY EXCITED ABOUT THAT AND I WILL SAY YESTERDAY TO WE ARE PROGRAMMING WAS FINISHED SO START RECALCULATING FOR THE SELF EMPLOYED UNDER THE PANDEMIC UNEMPLOYMENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAM- WE ACTUALLY PAID OUT THE FIRST HUNDRED SIXTY SEVEN. BUT NOW BE READ RECALCULATED THEIR FAITH BASED INCOME THEY TESTED. YEAH WILL PAY THEM THAT THERE SO IF THEY'RE ALL UP TO THE FOUR FIFTY MATH. THAN THAT WHAT THEY'LL GET AND I. THAT'S ON TODAY TODAY. IF I COULD JUST MAKE A COUPLE COMMENTS AND THIS SUBCOMMITTEE KNOWS MY FOCUS WHEN IT COMES TO I. T. BUT- BOB YOU KNOW RECENTLY THE HEAD OF EDT PSYCHOLOGY DURING THE LAST RECESSION WAS INTERVIEWED AND HE WAS TALKING ABOUT THE FACT THAT EDT AS A THIRTY YEAR. OLD COMPUTER SYSTEM USING THIS. OLD COMPUTER LANGUAGE THAT SO OUTDATED THAT PEOPLE AGENCIES ARE NOW FORCED TO BRING PEOPLE OUT OF RETIREMENT. AND WHEN HE WAS A CODER IN ET DE YEARS AGO THEY HAD A HUNDRED FIFTY CODERS AND NOW YOU'RE SAYING THAT THEY HAVE FIFTEEN- AND- I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE LOOKING TO MODERNIZE YOUR SYSTEM I TOOK A LOOK AT. THOSE PLANS- JUST FOR COLLEAGUES TO KNOW- IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN YOU STARTED THIS ELEVEN YOUR PROJECT. WORK FOR YOU AND THERE'S ANOTHER STE AND YOUR STICK WELL. I RED AND ONE ANY AMOUNT OF MONEY BUT THE TIME WE'RE DONE WITH THAT TECHNOLOGY THAT WAS DECIDED ON IS GOING TO BE OUT OF DATE. AND SO KNOW FOR MY PERSPECTIVE I'M- AYE THIS IS OBVIOUSLY. INCREDIBLY CHALLENGING I THINK- IT YOU KNOW AS I'VE BEEN IT'S BEEN SUGGESTED TO ME STARTED IN OUR TEAM WITH THIS TECHNOLOGY AND MEDIA EXPERIENCES LITTLE BIT. HI AMY STILL. BACKED EACH YEAR WELL AND- YOU KNOW IT'S A LOT. BUT I'M SO SORRY- SO I AGREED SO TO PREVENT THAT BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT SEVERAL OUT OF SYSTEM THAT WAS JUST GOING TO BE OBSOLETE IN DAY ONE SO- PART OF OUR PROCESS AS WE ARE GOING FOR OUR SHOW OFF THE SHELF. OFFICIAL ON PRODUCT. OF WHICH IS USED IN MANY OTHER STATE SENATE SIMILAR TO WHAT WE USE FOR OUR TAX SYSTEM. SO IT'S IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE VENDOR THAT WILL CONTINUE TO UPGRADE AN UPDATE AND BEST PRACTICES. LIKE FOR LIKE A MOCK MICROSOFT WINDOWS- YOU KNOW WE CONTINUE GET UPGRADES AND BEST PRACTICES THE SYSTEM THAT WE ARE LOOKING TO. UTILIZE WILL BE A SYSTEM THAT WILL CONTINUE TO STAY CURRENT AND FLEXIBLE- I THINK BACK WHEN WE HAD ALL THOSE PROGRAMMERS WAS WHEN WE ONLY HAVE- ME TRAIN SYSTEM. WE DID DO SOMEONE CAN NINE YEARS AGO WE'RE ADDED ON ALL THE ONLINE FEATURES WHICH DOES NOT REQUIRE FALL WE DON'T DON'T NEED A NUMBER OF PROGRAMMERS. NOW THAT WE NEEDED BACK THEN- BUT I WILL TELL YOU WE'VE HAD TO TRAIN OUR OWN COBALT PROGRAMMERS IN OUR OWN PRO. DOES YOUR- BECAUSE- YOU KNOW FINDING FOOTBALL PROGRAM IS A- IS A DIFFICULT TASK IN. BACK TO THE FUTURE YOU KNOW LISTEN MY ONLY COMMENT ON THIS IS THE IDEA THAT A MODERNIZATION PROJECT IS GOING TO TAKE ELEVEN YEARS IT'S COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE. AND WE PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE YOU KNOW HOPEFULLY WILL BE ON THIS BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS BUT WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO HAVE SMALLER CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE TIME THAT PASSING ON AT IT AROUND LANGUAGE ACCESS SUCH. JUST CALL. NO FULL WELL. WE HAVE. SO MANY HIS EMPLOYER FROM ENGLISH AS THEIR FIRST LANGUAGE. OUR IN RIGHT THE CHALLENGE. FACING THEM HOW OFTEN. AND HOW DOES ET SS LANGUAGE NEEDS OF CALIFORNIANS TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH OUR STATE. TIMELY ALATORRE ACT. SO YES SO WE PARTICIPATE IN A TIMELY AUDITORY- ERR I THINK EVERY FEW YEARS AND IT'S GETTING READY TO LAUNCH RIGHT NOW AND WE'VE HAD A VERY GOOD COMPLIANCE RATE OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS- WE DO OFFER FOR YOU I AN ENGLISH AND SPANISH- A LOT. SITE ALL A CALL CENTRE WE HAVE ENGLISH SPANISH AND A FEW OTHER- DIRECT NUMBERS FOR DIFFERENT LANGUAGES BUT WE ALSO HAVE AN INTERNAL DIRECTORY- FOR ALL LANGUAGES THROUGHOUT OUR DEPARTMENT SO IF SOMEONE CALLS AND LANGUAGE ASSISTANCE WE HAVE SOMEONE THAT WE CAN CONNECT THEM TO. WE TAKE A LANGUAGE ISSUE AREAS BECAUSE THAT YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T NAVIGATE IF YOU CAN'T UNDERSTAND PROPERLY THAT- AND WITH THE HIRING OF EIGHTEEN HUNDRED PEOPLE WE SPECIFICALLY PLAN ARE AVERAGE. MEN YELL DIFFERENT TOP BLANK DOES THAT WERE SEEKING AND- UP SO WE'RE LOOKING TO HIRE A LOTS OF A BILINGUAL PEOPLE THAT'S OUR HOPE. WELL I HEARD AND I UNDERSTAND THAT PART OF THE SYSTEM IS ON. SPANISH AND THEN AS YOU REFER TO OTHER PART OF THE SYSTEM IS ENGLISH AND SPANISH AND A FEW OTHER LANGUAGES WELL THE FEW OTHER LANGUAGES AS YOU CAN IMAGINE ARE THE APL LANGUAGE IS. THE RIVER THANK NUMBER OF. TWO WHO I AM HEARING ARE NOT BEING SERVED BY YOUR DEPARTMENT SO- I HAVE WONDERED IF EDT IS IN COMPLIANCE WITH- WITH ACT AND WHETHER WE NEED TO DO MORE. TO PUT THAT I'VE WONDERED. OTHER IN AGES. SHIFT LANGUAGE ACCESS PERSON. TO ASSIST YOU GUYS DURING THIS TIME BUT A DEVICE TO SAY YOU KNOW THERE REALLY IS A TREMENDOUS OR- MOMENT. TO FOLKS GETTING AND I KNOW YOU GET THAT BUT- BUT A SAID. NO LASTING AND I'M GONNA TURN OVER TO COLLEAGUES. YOU KNOW THAT THERE'S AN INCREDIBLE PERCEPTION THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA THAT EDIE'S WORK. IS NOT JUST WAY TOO SLOW BUT IN THEIR INTERACTIONS WITH YOUR STAFF. SENSE OF URGENCY. THERE IS A TREMENDOUS BUREAUCRACY WERE NOT GETTING A CUSTOMER FOCUSED WORKER FOCUSED- SORT OF PERSPECTIVE WHEN OUR CONSTITUENTS ARE CALLING YOUR OFFICE. AND I GET THAT THERE IS AN UNPRECEDENTED WORKLOAD BUT I BELIEVE THAT GOVERNMENT CAN DO BETTER AND IT HAS TO DO BETTER DURING THIS TIME. I KNOW YOU UNDERSTAND THAT BUT- YEAH WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT IS THAT IS AN IMPERATIVE WE'VE NOT HEARD THE TYPE OF. THE SUFFERING PEOPLE ARE EXPERIENCING NOW JUST. WITH REGARD TO THE SPEND BUT ONE CALL YOUR- BUREAUCRACY IT SO I'VE I'VE I'VE THAT THE FEEDBACK ORGANIC IS TREACHEROUS AND I BELIEVE WE CAN DO BETTER. OUTLOOK COVERS US. CAMERA THE POSITION IS THERE OF MY COLLEGE. FOUR HUNDRED IN THE KEY. PART STOP IT ONE OF BECAUSE OF THEIR HEARING THIS ROOM. TO VACATE. SO. TIME BECAUSE OF THE OTHER SUBS TALK ABOUT SO WITH HIS AREA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF MIKE. THE TO CALL BEFORE ME WHO A VERY AS MANY. AND SO I DON'T MEAN TO BELABOR THE POINT BECAUSE THERE'S JUST SO MANY WAYS MULTIPLE WAYS YOU CAN CUT A CERTAIN ISSUE BUT YOU'RE STILL GOING TO BE PROVIDING THE SAME ANSWERS TO US. SO I WANT TO JUST. SEE IF THERE ARE SOME AVENUES THAT WE CAN BE TAKING THAT COULD HELP. ADDRESS SOME OF THESE ISSUES FOR MY COLLEAGUES. MR CHIU ASKING QUESTIONS YOU ANSWERED WITH FIFTEEN COBLE PER MY NEXT QUESTION. CHECK OUT MY CALL WAS WHAT THE RICH. WHAT IT. IS GONNA PROMPT BUT WILL BE THAT FOR NOW DAY. SO JUST GIVE YOU A SNAPSHOT AND I'VE I SPOKEN OF THIS WITH MISS SECRETARY AS SOON AS WELL BUT JUST TO GIVE YOU A STAFF. I AM MY STAFF TO GIVE ME NO FOR THREE DAYS. STARTING WITH THE TO A AND- IN APRIL TWENTY ON APRIL TWENTY EIGHTH THREE UNDER TWENTY SIX CALLS ON THE TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED AND THIRTY ON THE TWENTY NINTH AND THEN IT TAPERED DOWN TO EIGHTY NINE BY THE THIRTIETH AND EMAILS WERE RESPECTIVELY FOR THE DAYS A HUNDRED AND FIFTY FOUR SEVENTY FIFTY EIGHT. OF ROUGH IN FIFTY UNIQUE MALES AND CALLED. IN THREE D. IT HASN'T LET UP. OF IT DOESN'T EVEN COUNTING SOCIAL MEDIA AND ALL THE DIFFERENT AVENUES OF COMMUNICATING WITH OUR OFFICE OR INDIVIDUALS WITHIN THE OFFICE NOW THIS IS ALSO BEING BORN ON PRIMARILY FOR FULL STAFF IS ONE DIRECTOR THREE STAFFERS THE REST OF THE CAPITOL OFFICE HAS ALSO BECOME FIELD STAFFERS FIELDING ALL TYPES OF CONSTITUENT. CASES I APPRECIATE YOU SAYING THAT WE'VE BEEN GOOD PARTNERS THE PART OF THE CHALLENGE AND WHY EMPHASIZE AND QUANTIFY THESE NUMBERS. IS THAT. WE'VE WANTED TO BE PARTNERS WE WANTED TO BETTER BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND THE TIME LINES AND THE ISSUES AND TO TRY TO GIVE AS MUCH ANSWER TARKAN STATEMENTS AS POSSIBLE SO THAT NOT ONLY ARE WE MAINTAINING THEIR LEVEL OF CONFIDENCE AND WHAT'S HAPPENING. BUT TO ALSO BE ABLE TO SHOW TO THEM THAT THERE IS A LIGHT AND THE AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL. AND THE PROBLEM. BECAME EXACERBATED WHEN WE STOP GETTING CALLS. TO OUR OFFICE OUR CALLS RETURNED BY EDT. AND YEAH. I AGAIN WE'VE ASKED ABOUT ACCOUNTABILITY WE'VE ASKED ABOUT WHAT WHEN WE CAN EXPECT CERTAIN THINGS TO HAPPEN BUT I THINK IT BEHOOVES YOU ANY BECOMES EXTREMELY IMPORTANT THAT OUR COMMUNICATION NEVER BREAKS DOWN. SO THAT WE KNOW WHAT WE ARE ALSO EXPLAINING TO OUR CONSTITUENTS AND THAT WHAT WE EXPLAIN TO THEM IS ACCURATE. AND CONTINUES TO MAINTAIN THAT LEVEL OF CONFIDENCE. SO THAT'S ONE POINT ANOTHER POINT WAS I THINK MR GLORIA TOUCHED ON THIS BUT I DON'T KNOW IF IT IF HE EXACTLY MENTIONED THIS BUT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT DIFFERENT WAYS OF COMMUNICATION AND IT SEEMS LIKE THERE'S A LACK TIME WHEN THE COMMUNICATION TAKES PLACE THROUGH MAIL. WHY AREN'T WE EMPLOYING AN EMAIL SYSTEM SO THAT PEOPLE CAN AND IT'S A CHEAPER MORE COST EFFECTIVE WAY AS WELL. THERE MIGHT BE SECURITY RELATED ISSUES THAT YOU'RE CONCERNED WITH AND I'D BE INTERESTED TO KNOW IF. THAT IS ONE OF THE REASONS BUT- WHY AREN'T WE BETTER EMPLOYING EMAILS SO THAT THE COMMUNICATION CAN HAPPEN MUCH QUICKER YOU SAID SOMETHING ABOUT TEXTING. BUT STILL. AT WE'RE NOT SEEING THAT EMAIL IS. AS MUCH AS WE EXPECTED TO SEE ESPECIALLY AT A TIME LIKE THIS WHEN YOU ALSO WANT TO BE COST EFFECTIVE. RIGHT THAT IS SOMETHING WE JUST STARTED EXPLORING WE- HAVE STARTED U. UTILIZING EMAIL FOR- OUTBOUND COMMUNICATIONS AND WE INTEND TO DO MORE OF IT. SO FIFTH SO YES I AGREE. TO THE DEGREE WE CANNOT TO GET DEPENDING ON WHAT THE DOCUMENTS ARE IN THE COMMUNICATION. BUT IT IS SOMETHING WE JUST STARTED AND MORE WILL COME OF THAT. OKAY. BY WELL AGAIN I DON'T BELIEVE IT THE POINT BUT BY EXACTLY WHEN DO YOU FEEL YOU'RE GONNA BE AT A CERTAIN CAPACITY THAT IS ADDRESSING A GREAT MAJORITY OF. THE CLAIMANT'S QUESTIONS. ALL ALL THE CLAIMANTS QUESTIONS I MEAN AT THIS POINT I MEAN. AND BY THE WAY TO A AYE I S. THIS. BECAUSE IN IN NORMAL TIMES WEEK FOR HER THAT THE PRESENT AND DURING THE PRESENTATION AND DURING OUR YEARS OF EXPERIENCE HERE AS WELL IT TAKES ABOUT THREE WEEKS. RIGHT NOW MY STAFF IS GETTING RESPONSES FROM BETWEEN SIX TO SEVEN WEEKS AGO. I DON'T KNOW IF MY OFFICE IS UNIQUE UP I DON'T THINK IT IS. BUT SIX TO SEVEN WEEKS AT A TIME WHEN. SOMEONE YOU HAVEN'T HASN'T EVEN HEARD. WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THEIR FATE. WHILE BLATTER ARE BUY OLD TILING OR OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES THAT THEY FIND THEMSELVES IN. A I AGAIN THIS ISN'T THIS ISN'T TO BERATE EDT IT'S JUST THAT- YOU ALSO CAN UNDERSTAND AND YOUR EMPLOYEES CAN UNDERSTAND THE PLIGHT DIFFERENT PEOPLE CAME IN. A GOOD. RESULT 80% OF THE CHALLENGES. AND THAT'S WHERE I AM I'M- THE YOU HEAR MY FIRST OF ITEM UNDERSTAND. THAT COMMUNICATION. ISN'T TAKING PLACE IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT THAT. LEVEL OF CONFIDENCE ISN'T BROKEN DOWN BECAUSE IT'S COMPLETELY BROKEN AT THIS POINT AND WE'RE JUST I THINK ALL TRYING TO DO OUR PATCH OF WORK TO MAKE SURE THE DAM DOESN'T CRUMBLE ENTIRELY. IN THE TALK ABOUT WANTING UP NEW AGENCY NEEDY EVEN THOUGH THERE. EMPLOYEES WORKING IN YOU I HAVE DROPPED OVER TIME THE NIGHT OF CLAIMS. IT IS HAS A REDUCED EMPLOYEES EMPLOYEES WENT SOMEWHERE ELSE AND IF YOU DE. BOB LINE THERE STILL THERE. SO THIS IS THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE. AND THAT AND WE'RE CAUCUS CALLED MEMBERS NUMBER ONE ISSUE HANDS DOWN I MEAN PEOPLE EVERYONE ME TO DON THIS THAT IT IS A BIG ISSUE. YEAH ACCIDENT MISTER GLORIA SAID WE GET CALLS EVERYDAY IF MARKETS WITH A IT AND THEN GAP OF THE AMONG THE RATE WE- FOR THIS THE I MEAN IT'S RIDICULOUS SHOULDN'T Y. UP THAT'S WHAT YOU THE THEREFORE. AND WE'VE TO MORE FOR FOLKS THAT WANNA SPEAK MISTER LACKEY MISS WICKS MISS LACKEY AND MIND YOU HAVE FOUR FORTY SOME WITNESSES. I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT. OKAY SORRY ABOUT THEIR. AS YOU CAN HEAR THE DESPERATION OF FRUSTRATION. EXTREME AND THE OUR CONSTITUENTS ARE DESPERATE FOR INCOME THE ONES WE'RE TALKING ABOUT- THEY HAVE FAMILY MEMBERS THEY HAVE VERY VERY. DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHEN THEY WHEN YOU YOU GO AND YOU MAKE YOUR PHONE CALL TWO ET D. WHICH IS YOUR LIFE LINE. I KNOW ONE OF THE BIGGEST FRUSTRATIONS THAT I'M HAVING- EPEATED OVER AND OVER OUR HANG OUT. BEACH SAKE. OF PEOPLE CALL IN AND THEY GET A RECORDED MESSAGE AND BLUE YOU CAN'T LEAVE A MESSAGE YOU CAN'T. GET ANY INTERACTION AND EVEN SOME OF THE LIVE CALLS WE'VE HAD HANG UPS. THAT IS REALLY UNACCEPTABLE AND I'D- ARE YOU AWARE OF THIS AND IS THERE ANY PLAN IN PLACE TO TRY TO MINIMIZE THAT. SO YES YOU HAVE A QUALITY CONTROL PROGRAM THAT WE JUST STARTED TO ENSURE BETTER CONSISTENCY- AROUND THAT AND- YES WE UNDERSTAND THERE HAVE BEEN SOME COMPLAINTS. AND WE ARE CONTINUING TO SEND OUT DIFFERENT BULLETINS AND MONITORING- WE'VE ALSO- JUST EMPLOYED VENDOR TO HELP US. OUT WITH HOW WE- SHARE OUR PROCEDURES AND- YEAH COMMUNICATIONS WITH OUR STAFF SO THEY CAN MORE READILY DIGEST THEM AND BE ABLE TO PROVIDE GOOD CONSISTENT ANSWERS- THAT'S ACTIVE LEVY WORKING ON RIGHT NOW AS WELL.

BUT WE HAVE A- WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO REPRESENT OUR CONSTITUENTS AND SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS TO SHARE WITH YOU. THE EXTREME FRUSTRATION AND THE SENSE OF URGENCY AS REALLY UNPARALLELED AND- MANY OF THESE PEOPLE'S LIVES AND HOPEFULLY. FOREVER BUT ALMOST HALF OF THE CALLS MY OFFICE RECEIVES ABOUT BEING DISQUALIFIED FOR BENEFITS. THEY GET NO EXPLANATION FOR HOW TO RESOLVE ANY RESOLUTION AND- I'M HOPING THAT THERE MIGHT BE SOME- A PLAN IN PLACE TO CHANGE THAT. SOME AS TO WHY. ALL FIRED ON THEY MIGHT THERE ARE SOME OTHER OPTIONS IS THAT POSSIBLE YEAH WE ARE- WE ARE EXPLORING THAT AND ONE OF THE WAYS- LET THE TEXTING CAMPAIGN THAT I MENTION THAT IS ONE OF THE WAYS WE'RE LOOKING TO SEE IF THAT FEASIBLE TO HELP- BY THE END. OF MORE READILY AND GIVE MORE SPECIFICS SO OF YES WE'RE WE'RE LOOKING AT THAT AS WELL BECAUSE WE UNDERSTAND THE FRUSTRATION AND I JUST I TELL YOU YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT YOUR COMMUNITY YOUR COMMUNITY IS MY COMMUNITY. FORUMS MY COMMUNITY UP I. AND WE'RE AGAIN AND WE ARE A- IN OUR POWER. TO MAKE SURE WE'RE DOING RIGHT BY THE CITIZENS. MR OR WE CAN HAVE A CHANCE THE US DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND A QUESTIONS.

A VERY BRIEF GO AHEAD THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I'LL KEEP IT SHORT BECAUSE I THINK THE POINT IS WHEN EXPRESSED ADEQUATELY- BUT YOU KNOW WE HAVE. I GET A NIGHTLY CONSTITUENCY REPORT OF ALL CALLS AND EMAILS OF COME INTO MY OFFICE. FOR A LITTLE HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE FIGURE OUT HOW THEY'RE GOING TO FEED THEIR FAMILY. HOW THEY CAN FEED THEIR CHILDREN. AND THEY'RE NOT GETTING HELP WHERE THEY KNOW THEY THEY SUS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE GETTING AT. SO THAT IS A SENSE OF URGENCY PEOPLE LEARNING HOW THEY'RE GONNA PAY THE RENT. AND SO THE FIX IS ON THIS IS ARE SO CRITICAL- I I'M I'M SORRY YOU PRICE A LITTLE GANGED UP ON HERE BUT WE'RE JUST REFLECTING WHAT OUR CONSTITUENTS ARE TELLING US. SO PLEASE DO EVERYTHING IN YOUR POWER TO MOVES ALONG IF YOU CAN. SYMPATHIZE AND THE ELDERS YOUR BEING WITH NO TO SAID THIS. I'VE MISTER LITTLE SYMPATHY BUT- I HAVE MORE SYMPATHY FOR. FOLKS MIGHT JUST TO OR WERE ALREADY MANY OF WHOM ALREADY LIVE BREAK A POVERTY. OR EXPRESSING- DOOR. PAVING TO BEGIN WITH- ARE NOW- ARE ARE GOING THROUGH A TOUGH TIME SO I JUST WANT. TO JUST. MOMENTS WELL. THANK YOU. SO YOU'RE QUESTIONS FOR YOU HAVE YOU RESPONSE SELECT COMMITTEE. L. OKAY THANK YOU SO MOVING ALL THE MAY. A QUESTION FROM MEMBERS. MISTER JIM ALBERT RUN MY COLLEAGUES- BEVERLY WOULD BE MUCH APPRECIATED TO GET AS MUCH PUBLIC COMMENTS POSSIBLE I'M GONNA ASK I HAVE A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS FROM HOUSING AND I LIKE TO ASK THE QUESTIONS- AND RATHER GO BACK AND FORTH AND RESPECTFUL OF THE PUBLIC COMMENT- WOULD LOVE TO GET ANSWERS TO THEM SO- THE FIRST HAS TO DO WITH THE PROJECT ROOM KEY. GOOD CONCEPT- BUT I THINK THEY'RE A LOT OF CONCERNS ABOUT WHETHER IT'S ACTUALLY GONNA TURN HOTELS INTO SUPPORT OF HOUSING PEOPLE NEED WRAPAROUND SERVICES UP THEIR ESTIMATES IS GOING TO COST OVER TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS PER UNIT TO- AND READ. I AND EACH OF THESE UNITS ARE GONNA NEED ONGOING FUNDING IT TERRACES ON A TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS AND- THERE IS A PART OF THAT AT MATH JUST WORK THAT WAY. OPERATING COSTS THE GOVERNMENT ARCHITECT THIS AND- WOULD LOVE THE ADMIN ESTIMATES ON WHAT THE PER UNIT COSTS ARE BECAUSE JUST SEEMS LIKE IT'S NOT GONNA RELATED TO THE WONDERING IF WE COULD CONSIDER RENTAL ASSISTANCE TO MASTER LEASE FROM PRIVATE MARKET LANDLORDS PAYING RENT AS A LUMP SUM- WITH CAPITALIZE OPERATING ASSISTANCE FOR SUPPORT OF HOUSING OR- OR OTHER WAYS TO PRODUCE PERMANENT HOUSING- AND JUST. LOOKING FOR ANSWERS AND HOW THIS FUNDING IS GOING TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE GET SHELTERED DON'T RETURN TO THE STREETS. ALSO WANT TO MENTION THAT- I KNOW THAT THERE IS- PROPOSED BUDGET TRAILER LANGUAGE ON PRESERVING EXISTING SUBSIDIZE AFFORDABLE HOUSING STOCK BY STABILIZE AN EXISTING DEED RESTRICTED AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND GUARDING IT. AS DIRECTORS PLANE UP DISTRESSED ASSETS WONDERING WHAT THAT MEANS THERE IS A- A REAL CONVERSATION THAT PRESERVATION OF HOUSING COULD BE SAY TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A UNIT RATHER THAN TO ON A WINDOWS UNIT. JUST WANT TO UNDERSTAND THAT SO THAT'S ONE SUB. SECOND SUBJECT ON LOCAL GOVERNMENT FUNDING. IT SAYS ONE POINT SEVEN FIVE BILLION. TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FOR QUOTE HOMELESSNESS PUBLIC HEALTH PUBLIC SAFETY AND OTHER SERVICES TO COMBAT COVERED NINETEEN. THE QUESTION IS THAT PHRASE OTHER SERVICES TO COMBAT COVERED NINETEEN. DOES THAT MEAN TO STOP FUNDING HAVE TO BE DEVOTED TO HOMELESSNESS OR COULD BE USED FOR ANY PURPOSE AND I THINK. IF IT'S IF IT'S THE LATTER THERE'S A LOT OF CONCERN THAT THIS ONE POINT SEVEN FIVE MILLION IS NOT REALLY JUST FOCUSED ON HOMELESSNESS. ALL RELATED. I WE UNDERSTAND THAT THIS MONEY HAS TO BE SPENT BY THE END OF THE YEAR. AND CLEARLY SAYS THANK TO END ON GERMAN FOR TWENTY TWENTY ONE. SO WONDERING WHAT THAT REALLY MEANS. A THIRD QUESTION AND I'LL JUST AND HERE IS A- VERY GRATEFUL THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS SUPPORTING THE CONTINUATION OF THE LIGHT TECH- THE TEXTURE. OF FIVE HUNDRED MILLION- THEIR CONCERNS AT THE PROPOSED FIVE MILLION DOLLAR CAP ON TAX READY CLAIMS. WOULD UNDERMINE OUR GOALS. THAT MAJOR INVESTORS IN THESE OFTEN BY MORE THAN THAT- WE'VE HEARD THAT THE MERE PROPOSALS ACTUALLY DECREASING INVESTOR APPETITE FOR THESE TAX CREDITS. AND PUTTING PROJECT FINANCING IN JEOPARDY AND SO. I WANT TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH YOU OFTEN OTHERS ABOUT WHETHER AND I WOULD THINK WE MAY NEED AN EXCEPTION. FROM THIS FIVE MILLION DOLLAR CAP FOR LIKE TO CRACK SO. SUBJECTS SOME ANSWERS APPRECIATE THE CHAIR. SURE FOR CONTENT WITH MEMBERS ASKING QUESTIONS IT IS RESPOND. ALL THIS WILL I HAVE A BUNCH OF HOUSING FOR TO BE I'LL TRY TO LAY IT BECAUSE I KNOW WE'VE GOT A BUNCH OF FOLKS SO WANTED TO SEE IF- I'M- FRIEND TO PROVIDE CLARITY IN THE SIX AND MILLION ARE. YOUR MARKS PROJECT A ROOM KEY. HELL BE USED- HOW MUCH EACH CITY WILL RECEIVE- ALONG THOSE LINES- IF THERE'S FLEXIBILITY THAT FUNDING FOR RENTAL ASSISTANCE AND WHAT THE PLANS ARE FOR RENTAL ASSISTANCE MORE BROADLY. YOU KNOW I THINK YOU KNOW WHEN THE WHEN GOVERNOR NUISANCE EVICTION MORE TIMES LIFTED. I THINK THERE'S GOING TO BE A REAL SERIOUS CONCERNS AROUND MASSIVE ACTIONS IN THE STATE SO WHAT ARE WE DOING TO ADDRESS THAT. AND WHAT IT CAN THESE FUNDS BE USED FOR SOMETHING LIKE THAT EITHER THE PROJECT ROOM KEY FUNDS OR THE MORTGAGE SETTLEMENT FUNDS AS WELL- AND WITH THAT. POTENTIAL RENTALS IS. THAT MAY BE. A OF HOW WE TRACKING THAT INFORMATION- IN TERMS OF THE- AND PROVIDING ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THOSE MONIES. BEING SPENT. I DO OF THE- FIRST. WOULD TRACKING EL TO THAT WHICH I WOULD WE I THEIR SUPPORT ELEMENTS OF OUR OR WHOLE HEARTEDLY SO THOSE ARE MY QUESTIONS SORT OF AROUND- PROJECT ROOM KEY AND HOW WE'RE GONNA BE SUPPORTING ARE HOMELESS COMMUNITIES. JUST FOR FUN DE OBVIOUSLY SOON NUMBERS I THINK ONLY HALF OF THE ROOMS AND THEN. TAKEN BY FOLKS AND- I STILL BELIEVE ALL. OF THEM A LOT OF THOSE KINDS OF MENTAL ILLNESS SO THE FOLKS ARE TURNING DOWN NOT ACCEPTING TO COME INDOORS. IS BECAUSE AN ENORMOUS SOTHEBY'S ISSUES NOT ONE TO FOLLOW RULES THEY HAVE PETS SO WE'VE GOT TO GET. MORE INFORMATION ON THAT ON WHY MOVE MORE FULL START COMING IN THAT PROGRAM. UNLESS IT'S STILL BE FREE DIMINISH THAT. MISTER GLORIA. YEAH ON THE FINANCING MATTER I JUST IT'S BEEN UNCLEAR TO ME TO THE EXTENT THE ROOMS THAT ARE RESERVED. IF THEY'RE NOT UTILIZED OUR IS THE TAXPAYER STILL PAYING FOR THAT I THINK DIFFERENT ACCOUNTS WITHOUT HAVING A DEFINITIVE ANSWER WOULD BE BENEFICIAL- AND THAT JUST FOR THE RECORD I HAVE A NUMBER OF. UNEMPLOYMENT A RELATED QUESTION I'LL BE SENDING TO THE DEPARTMENT I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WAS QUITE UNDERSTOOD THAT THERE WAS AN EXPECTATION AND A COMMITMENT TO ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS BUT- ON THE ROOF. KEY QUESTION I THINK THAT THAT'S PRETTY IMPORTANT SURE AND THEN ON THE SICK TAX I DO THE GOVERNOR'S FULL TO RAISE THE CIGARETTE TAX. THIS OF. THE PACK OF CIGARETTES. AND IF YOU CAN ABOUT SIMPLE IN. ARM HAVE EXPECTED REVENUE. BUT THE COST IMPLEMENTTHE PROGRAM HOW KNOW FOR TO TOOK TWO YEARS TO COME UP ON THAT. IT LOOKS. YEAH THE. FIFTH HAVE FINANCE TENS OF THE HOUSING OKAY WE FINANCE IT AS THE HEALTH QUESTIONS FIRST OF CERTAINLY KRYSTLE APARTMENT FINANCE- HEARING A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT PROJECT ROOM KEY AND I'M HERE TO ADDRESS- THOSE- THE IDEA HERE IS BIRDS THE A SUCCESSFUL PARTNERSHIPS WE'VE HAD SO FAR WITH THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN TERMS OF USING THE- SOME OF THE CORONAVIRUS RELIEF FUNDS AND SOME OF THE STATE GENERAL FUND. TO HELP GET PEOPLE IN THE HOTELS AND MOTELS. THE MOST BOND POPULATIONS. AND THAT YOUR PROJECT ROOM KEYS WE HAVE SIX HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS IN FEDERAL CREDIT BY RITUALLY FUNDS WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE. THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT HOUSING COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT. AND THEY WILL GO AHEAD AND THEY WILL- WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO IS ARE GOING TO- STRAIGHT OUT IN THE FORM OF GRANTS AS WHAT RENT DISSIPATING WHERE- CITIES AND COUNTIES WILL COME TO A- CD. IT WILL HELP YOUR PROPOSAL FOR HELL TO THEY WOULD DELIVER TO SIX HUNDRED NO. THIS MONEY TO GO AHEAD. SECURE HOUSING FOR FORTIES ARE ON A MORE PERMANENT BASIS STATE HOUSING ON A PERMANENT BASIS IT DOES NOT HAVE TO BE LIMITED ONLY TO PROPERTIES THAT ARE PARTICIPATING CURRENTLY PROJECT FROM KING I CAN BE ANY SORT OF PROPERTY THAT CAN BE PERSONS TO WAIT PROVIDE SAFE HOUSING FOR PEOPLE ON A PERMANENT BASIS. AND ANOTHER THING I WOULD NOTE IS THAT THERE IS. TERMS OF ROOM KEY THERE IS. ALSO IT'S A LIMITED POOL OF MONEY THAT HAS TO BE SPENT BY DECEMBER THIRTY AT THE TWO THOUSAND TWENTY SO WE HAVE APPROXIMATELY SEVEN MONTHS IN WHICH TO WORK SO WHAT CD IS GOING TO DO IS WE'RE GOING TO WORK WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. WHAT'S THE- A SET UP YEAH IT'S- SO TO SPEAK SOLICIT- INPUT FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THAT WANT TO PARTICIPATE. AND EIGHT CITIES IN A CAST AS WIDE AS POSSIBLE TO GET ALL LOCAL GOVERNMENTS CITIES AND COUNTIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE THAT WISH TO PARTICIPATE. AND EIGHT CITIES GOING TO WORK WITH THAT. FIVE POST PROPOSALS ARE THE MOST APPLICATION YOU'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO LEVERAGE THE- BEST. RETURN ON THE- THE SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. AND I WILL GO AHEAD AND AT LEAST. THE HELP THE LOCALS THESE PROCUREMENTS. AND HAVE TO BE FINISHED BY DECEMBER THIRTIETH TWENTY TWENTY. AND PART OF THE REVIEW PROCESS WILL BE TO WORK WITH LOCALS TO ENSURE THAT. THOSE THAT ARE SELECTED HAVE. OF MEANS. AND TEEN THE CIVIL ON. CAN I IS THAT. THERE'S OBVIOUSLY AS THE MEMBERS OF OUT THERE'S GOING BE AN ONGOING NEED SERVICES TO MAINTAIN THE CIVIL TO SERVE THE PEOPLE LIVING IN OTHER HOTEL DEPART PROCESS AS WELL AND THIS IS STILL BEING DEVELOPED BUT- WE DO ANTICIPATE THAT EACH C. D. WILL BE PREPARED. TO BEGAN IN BUSINESS LISTENING INPUT FROM LOCALS WHICH TO PARTICIPATE- ON JULY FIRST. SO OBVIOUSLY THIS MONEY TO BE SPENT BY THE END OF THIS YEAR THURMOND AFTER ACTION REPORT DETAILING THE INFORMATION WHO- SUBSCRIBE THIS WE TOOK IN I MEANS WE HAVE A SNAPSHOT OF WHAT. TRANSPIRED THAT SHOULD BE THE EIGHT YES I'D LIKE WILL BE THE CITY WOULD BE ABLE TO PURCHASE PRICE OF THE- I THINK THE IMPORTANT PART ABOUT THAT IS WHY FOLKS ARE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF IT SO WE KNOW WHY. IF IT IS BECAUSE OF. SUBSTANCE ABUSE OTHER RETURNS THEN IN SEVERAL OTHER JURISDICTIONS ON THEY'VE OFFERED IT OTHER PROGRAMS A LOT OF FOLKS HAVE A TAKE ADVANTAGE FOR ME TO REASONS AND HAPPY TACKLE THAT. IN CHANGE THAT. TO GET IN IN IN IN AND GET HELP WITH SO MUCH NEED. THAT IS ACCORDING THE FIGURES I'VE THERE'S BOUT SIXTEEN THOUSAND CONTRACTED ROOMS A ON. APPROXIMATELY EIGHT THOUSAND OF THE BILL RIGHT NOW. AND ONE OF THE COFFEE US ON THAT IS THAT THIS. EFFORT REALLY ONLY STARTED ABOUT TWO MONTHS AGO SO. GRANTED ONLY HALF THE ROOMS ARE FILLED IN THERE ARE A VARIETY OF CHALLENGES INVOLVED IN GETTING PEOPLE TO TAKE IT AND I JUST. BE PROVIDED. BUT HAVING SAID THAT. I THINK IT'S ALSO TO THE- OF OUR LOCAL. THE PART OF THE SOCIAL. IN GENERAL SERVICES THEY'VE- MANAGED TO% ACHIEVE AS MUCH AS THEY HAVE SO FAR AND- SO. THE TRACK RECORD FOR SUCCESS IS BEEN LATE AND WE THINK THAT. BUT BROWN RIGHT. GLORIA TOOTE TO THAT POINT IF EIGHT THOUSAND TO FIFTEEN DOLLARS ARE BEING USED ARE WE PAYING FOR SIXTEEN THOUSAND REPAINT FOR EIGHT THOUSAND I DON'T HAVE. THAT THE ANSWER EXACTLY FOR YOU BUT WE'D BE HAPPY TO GET THAT. ADDITIONAL THAT THANK YOU. MR TO THE BY I APPRECIATE YOU STARTED ANSWER NUMBER QUESTION ABOUT THIS BUT I'M STILL LIKE AND HOPE TO RECEIVE ANSWERS TO THE QUESTIONS I ASKED IF IT REQUIRES ANOTHER FOLLOW UP MEETING HAPPY TO DO THAT TOO I KNOW WE JUST I JUST FIRED A BUNCH OF QUESTIONS BUT- LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT. THAT THESE TERMS OBJECTS THANKS. MORE QUESTION WITH WICKS YEAH AND JUST- A COUPLE FOLLOW UPS I ALSO WOULD LOVE TO HEAR- SOME ANSWERS ON THE QUESTION AROUND IF ANY OF THIS MONEY CAN BE SPENT FOR RENTAL ASSISTANCE- FOR THAT THERE'S ANYTHING IN THERE. AND THEN ALSO WHO ULTIMATELY MAKES THE DECISION ON HOW THE- PRESERVING THE BAT IS THAT DEAL FOR. REGARDING THE SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS- AGAIN THIS IS A LIMITED POOL OF MONEY THAT HAS TO BE EXPENDED. NOT ENCUMBER BUT ACTUALLY SPENT UNDER FEDERAL. GUIDELINES AND RULES BY. DECEMBER THIRTIETH SO- WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT RENTAL SYSTEMS WOULD BE AN APPROPRIATE USE FOR THESE MONIES BECAUSE RENTAL ASSISTANCE IS MORE ABOUT. ONGOING FUNCTION AND THESE DO HAVE TO BE SPENT TO GET BY THE END OF THE YEAR. AND IN TERMS OF THE USE THE MONEY- GONNA HAPPEN. CD IS GOING TO WORK WITH. THOSE VOCALS WHO WISH TO REACH OUT AND THEN. PUT IN AN APPLICATION FOR THESE FUNDS IN EACH CITY WILL- WEIGHING FACTORS AT WORK THAT I MENTIONED BEFORE- YOU KNOW THE EFFICACIOUS NOUS OF. THE PROPOSAL- THE BILL YOU TO MAINTAIN THE- THE FUNDED ROOMS ON ONGOING BASIS THAN EIGHT CD WILL GO AHEAD AND SELECT THOSE WHO ARE ON. THE TOWARD THE BEST WAY TO ACHIEVE THOSE GOALS. CARE QUESTIONS ON. OPERATION HERE HOMELESSNESS. OKAY WELL I REQUEST ABOUT EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION OF THESE COUPLES YOU'RE ASKING STATE EMPLOYEES TO TAKE A 10215% CUT A COMPOSITION OF THE NEXT YEAR WE'RE NOT THERE TO WORK STATE WORK FORCES- ACTUAL STATE EMPLOYEES NINETY FIVE THOUSAND OF WHOM LIVE IN MY DISTRICT THERE THOUSANDS OF OTHER POSITIONS SO CALLED P. Y. EASE WHICH ARE PERSONAL YEAR EQUIVALENTS THEY'RE OUTSOURCED A COST OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO DO STATE WORK EVERY YEAR. ARE THE ARE WE ASKING THESE COMPANIES AND THE PEOPLE A THE PROVIDE TO TAKE A 10% PAY CUT. SO MERRY HALTER AND APARTMENT OF FINANCE I AM. WHEN IT COMES TO USING CONTRACTORS FOR- SERVICES THAT. I WE MAY NOT HAVE ENOUGH. STATE EMPLOYEES FOR I'M I DON'T HAVE ANY INFORMATION ON THE CONTRACT HOSPITABLY CONTRACT COSTS CHANGING. CAN YOU BACK TO IS NOT EASY GOING FORWARD ON A NEW CONTRACTS I'M SURE THOSE WILL BE ADJUSTED. BUT COULD YOU LET US KNOW. OR CLASSES FOR THAT WHEN THE CONTRACTOR WRITTEN. GET BACK THAT BE GREAT. AND THE QUESTION THE COMMITTEE. THEN I'LL TALK ABOUT- THE CIGARETTES AS I SAID EARLIER ON THE CIGARETTE TAX- I AGREE WITH THE GOVERNOR ON THAT BUT- WHAT IS EXPECTED REVENUE AND WHAT IS THE COST AND WITH THE PROGRAM. AND WE'RE OTHER PROGRAMS IT TOOK TO. MEN SO. ONE OF THE THOUGHTS ON THAT. GOOD MORNING NO CHANGE CHAMBER AND CORPORATE FINANCE SO OF THE EXPECTED REVENUE FROM THE HIS CIGARETTE TAX IS THIRTY THREE MILLION IN THE BUDGET HERE. HOWEVER I HAVE TO CARRY OUT THAT THAT THAT IS- WE DON'T HAVE REAL GOOD DATA ON. OF THE AMOUNT OF. HI E. CIGARETTE CONSUMPTION SPECIFICALLY AND PARTICULARLY A BY NICOTINE LEVEL OF WHICH THAT THIS TAXES NICOTINE BASED. SO THAT THAT THAT- HER THIRTY THREE MILLION ESTIMATE IS SUBJECT TO A WIDE RANGE OF A BRIGHT WHITE VARIANTS- AND AS FAR AS THE COST EMPLOYMENT I REALLY DON'T HAVE THAT INFORMATION WITH BUT I CAN CERTAINLY GET BACK TO YOU. THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NEW PROGRAM OF THE CONSUMER 40% OF THE REVENUE RAISED BY TAXES. THAT SEEMS TO BE HIGH WHY IS THAT. HELLO THANK YOU I AGAIN I BUT I'M I'M NOT REALLY I HAVE BEEN FOCUSED ON THE IMPLEMENTATION SO. HOME I'LL HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT YEAH I'VE BEEN TOLD IS OVER 40% WHICH IS TO ME IS IT'S ASTRONOMICAL SO I WOULD ENCOURAGE ADMINISTRATION WORK THE STAKEHOLDERS. TO THE FIVE WAYS TO MINISTER THIS TAX MORE PERSONALLY SLIPPING GET BACK TO ME. I WOULD DEFINITELY APPRECIATE THAT. CERTAINLY. PAID FAMILY LEAVE- LIKE THIS ALL IMPORTANT- THIS LEGISLATURE'S VERY SUPPORT OF A WORKING FAMILIES BUT WE KNOW WITH COVER NINETEEN IS HAD A HUGE EFFECT SMALL BUSINESSES WHICH ARE PREDOMINATELY MINORITY EARNED MINORITY- AND IT'S A COUPLE QUESTIONS THIS PROPOSAL WILL POST A TWELVE WEEK WE BALANCE ON EMPLOYERS WITH ONLY ONE EMPLOYEE- ALLEY SMALL EMPLOYER PAGE THAT LEAVE AND FIND REPORT FOR TWELVE WEEKS. MR TURNED OUT BRENT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND TO ASSIST IN THOSE COSTS THE MAY PROVISIONAL CAN USE OF ONE BILLION DOLLAR GRANT FOR SMALL BUSINESSES TO HELP WITH RETRAINING COSTS WHILE THE- INVESTORS ARE TAKING THAT PAID LEAVE. YOU'RE WEARING SÝ MASK MY COLLEAGUE MISTER LACKEY YOU GUYS HAVE BOTH OF EXCELLENT EH THANK. AND THEN WHEN I TELL THE FREE. HI LESTER FOGGING UP TO THIS MAN ONLY PUT DOWN A LITTLE BIT. OF HOW DOES THIS WORK WITH FEDERAL LEAVE LAWS THAT WERE JUST PASSED AND THE CARES ACT. WILL THIS LEAVE RUN CONCURRENTLY WITH A LEAF PASSED AND THE CARES ACT. IN HOW MUCH LEGAL THAT WILL THAT TOTAL. I'M GONNA HAVE EFFECT YOU'RE NOT INTERESTED. YOUR QUESTIONS FOR A MONTHLY ONE ASKING QUESTIONS RIGHT NOW. OKAY I JUST GOT A COUPLE MORE THAN WE HAVE FOLKS TO CALL AND. BUT A LOT OF CALLS ON THE DEPARTMENT BUSINESS OVERSIGHT THE RE OREGON AT- I GUESS THE BIG ISSUE. IN FOR MY COLLEAGUES WHAT I'M HEARING IS THAT THE BRAND ORGANIZATION. THAT DOESN'T HAVE A LOT OF RULES AND AS WE'VE SEEN WITH CARBON OTHER. STATE AGENCIES- JUST LET UP THEIR OWN DEVICES THEY GO IN CREE RULES AND LAWS THAT. REALLY ARE DONE BY BUREAUCRATS AND NOT BY THE LEGISLATURE SO IT'S BEEN VERY VAGUE AND- LAWTON OVERSIGHT- IS IT DOESN'T TAKE THE DRILL DOWN ON THAT IS LEAVE IT VAGUE BECAUSE- OBVIOUSLY IN THIS COVER NINETEEN EPIDEMIC THERE'S MUCH TIME TO HAVE POLICY. AND REALLY VET THE GPL. THIS IS KIMBERLY HARBISON DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND ANSWERED YOUR QUESTION. A LEGISLATURE WOULD STILL HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO CREATE NEW LICENSURE CATEGORIES. WE ARE LOOKING AT- REGISTERING NEW USERS SO WHAT THE DIFFERENT. A DIFFERENT UP CATEGORY AND YOU WOULD STILL HAVE OVERSIGHT OVER THE LICENSURE. WITH RENTAL SIMPLY FOR KERR BUT IT INACTION IF CAN POLICY CHANGES THE LEGISLATURE HAS NOT HAD SUFFICIENT TIME TO CONSIDER. THE PROPOSAL ALSO DIFFERS TOO MUCH AUTHORITY TO NEW. WITHOUT SUFFICIENT LEGISLATIVE INPUT IN OVERSIGHT- IT'S TOUGH TO- OBVIOUSLY CLUB BACK WITHOUT THEIR SO. WE SEE THAT WITH OTHER STATE AGENCIES SO THE SAYING THIS WHOLE THIS WHOLE PROCESS IS YOU CAN SAY WE START WITH EASY THIS MORNING A LOT OF QUESTIONS TO ASK YOU THINK ABOUT THE HEARINGS HE'S COMMITTEES HAD ONE HEARING SO FAR. THE NEXT TO THE COMMITTEE THE WHOLE THE REPORTING THE BUDGET IN JUNE SO NORMALLY WE HAVE OVER A HUNDRED COMMITTEE MEETINGS. IN A SESSION THINK ABOUT THAT ONE HUNDRED COMMITTEE MEETINGS WERE LIKE IN THIS COMMITTEE MAY MEET FIVE SIX SEVEN EIGHT TIMES IN OTHER COMMITTEES WE TEND TO TEN TONS OF BEING TOLD BY STAFF WE MEET ANOTHER COMMITTEES MEET. SO COMING BACK HERE IS COMMITTEES MET ONE TIME. THE ME THE WHOLE NEXT AND THE BUDGET. IN JUNE AND I REALIZE ARE UNDER TREMENDOUS PRESSURE AND TRYING TIMES BUT STILL THE LEGISLATURE THE JOB TO DO TO MAKE SURE THE RELEASE OF A BRIDGE THE GOVERNMENT THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH JUST ABOVE ME EXECUTIVE BRANCH TO DO THOSE TYPE OF THING SO. IT'S TROUBLING SITTING HERE A LOT OF ANSWERS THAT- FOLKS CAN ANSWER AND I'M NOT BEING UP ANYBODY BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE STILL HAVE OUR JOB TO DO I REALIZE THE GOVERNOR HIS STAFF HAS THEIR JOB TO DO- BUT IT'S TROUBLES. IT IS A CHEN PAUL EGGS THE- IT HAS A GLOBAL THIS. THE D. DOT. NOT BECAUSE OF THESE AUTHORED ACTED WE'VE SEEN NUMEROUS TOP PLANS IT'S VERY HARD TO CLUB AFTER FULL. THAT SO QUESTION MY COLLEAGUES AT ALL. MISTER CHAIR IF I MAY MAKE A COMMENT TO YOUR QUESTION SURE OF WE RECOGNIZE THAT THIS IS A VERY DETAILED PROPOSAL AND WE HAVE INCLUDED A LANGUAGE THAT WOULD MAKE THE WORK OF A THING THAT'S NOW IN THE BUDGET BECAUSE OF THE- TICKET. CHANGING POSITIONS AND DOLLARS I HAVE PLAYED IT LIKE THAT WOULD CONTINUE THIS CONVERSATION WITH THE LEGISLATURE OVER THE SUMMER SO THERE WAS A TIME TO MEET WITH BILL AND FOR YOUR INPUT- TO WORK OUT THE LANGUAGE AND ON THE FUNDING. WOULDN'T GO INTO EFFECT UNTIL AN AGREEMENT IS REACHED ON THE LANGUAGE SO WHAT WOULD BE THE DIFFERENCE IF WE STARTED IT AND PUT OFF TILL NEXT YEAR I MEAN WHAT IS THE AGENCIES ARE UP AND RUNNING RIGHT NOW SEPARATELY IS NOT THIS AGENCY BUT WHAT WOULD BE. THE HARM IN PUTTING IT OFF UNTIL. NEXT YEAR. THE HARM WOULD BE GOOD. IN OF A- IF WE WAIT AND- AS THE LA- SUGGESTED. ANALYST IN THE POLICY COMMITTEE- WE WAIT FOR THE POLICY PROCESS THEN WE COME BACK WITH THE BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL. SUBSEQUENT TO THAT-AND THEN THERE'S HIRING SO WHAT'S UP MUCH LONGER IMPLEMENTATION PERIOD. WHEREAS WE THINK ESPECIALLY NOW IN THE GOVERNOR VARMINT. THERE'S OPPORTUNITY FOR BAD ACTORS TO BE DOING THINGS THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO GO OUT AND PROVIDE CONSUMER PROTECTION FOR. WE'VE GOT A LOT OF FOLKS THAT WANT TO COMMENT ON THE PUBLIC COMMENT AND WE'RE GONNA RUN OF TIME SO. THIS IS A MORE QUESTIONS. MR SHOOT I CANNOT QUESTIONS BUT- BY I APPRECIATE THE CHAIR'S COMMENTS ABOUT HOW- HOW SHORT THIS IS AND HOW FRANKLY LITTLE OVERSIGHT WE'RE GETTING TO THIS PROCESS I'M JUST GONNA MENTION. THREE QUICK THINGS I KNOW THERE'S SOME DISCUSSION AROUND- EXPANSION OF DROP PROTECTION AROUND FAMILY A PAID FAMILY LEAVE. I AND THAT'S SOMETHING I VERY MUCH SUPPORT I THINK WE ALL. KNOW HOW CRITICALLY IMPORTANT AS IS DURING THIS TIME PERIOD SO I HOPE THAT CONVERSATION CONTINUES. RELATED TO THAT- I KNOW THEY SAID THIS PAID. LEAVE BENEFITS ARE TIED TO RESOURCES THAT HELP SUPPORT SMALL BUSINESSES. SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF I THINK MILLIONS OF SMALL BUSINESSES PRACTICALLY. FROM DIVERSE COMMUNITIES MINORITY OWNED BUSINESSES IMMIGRANT ON BUSINESSES. OUT THERE REALLY HAS BEEN VERY LITTLE FOCUS ON HOW WE'RE HELPING THEM THERE'S BEEN MUCH MORE. FEDERAL IN A CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW TO HELP ESTABLISHED- SORT OF MAINSTREAM BUSINESSES BUT THESE THE BUSINESSES THAT MAKE UP CALIFORNIA. I KNOW THERE'S SOME PROPOSALS- TO MOVE FORWARD SPECIFICALLY AROUND. MINORITY OWNED BUSINESSES AND OTHERS AND I WANT TO JUST EXPRESS MY SUPPORT FOR THAT. AS WELL SUPPORT FOR- ANYTHING WE CAN DO AROUND THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT DURING THIS TIME PERIOD. WE ALL PROBABLY LOTS AND ALL THESE TOPICS BUT JUST WANTED TO. THROW THIS OUT AND HOPE MORE TIME IN THE FUTURE TO DISCUSS THIS. THANK YOU MISTER TO. THIS WICKS ONE TO ONE THING I WANTED TO ADD ON TO WHAT NOW MISTER TO SAID. I AM MEN FOR GREAT. ALSO UNDER THE- NUMBER ELECTION PROPOSED NOT THE FUNDING FOR OUR AND GIVE THE CHANGE VOTE BY MAY THAT'S VERY CRITICAL- I I'D BE HAPPY TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS OFFLINE WITH THE OFF ON THAT BUT THAT'S IN THE QUESTION TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE GETTING FULL ENFRANCHISEMENT THIS NOVEMBER SURE SO IF YOU ARE FAMILIAR QUESTIONS A STAFF AND OBVIOUSLY WITH THE FINANCE WILL QUESTION SIR UP AHEAD OF THE PUBLIC COMMENT THE NUMBER SPEAKERS ARE MINOR SPEAKER OF. PERSONAL ARE YOU ABLE MINUTE TIME LIMIT- WE'VE A HARD STOP TIME OF ONE O'CLOCK SO IF YOU CAN SAY IT- IN LESS THAN ONE MINUTE THAT WOULD BE MUCH APPRECIATED US WILL START WITH OUR FOR SPEAKERS. MISTER CHAIR AT ALL YES THEY ARE MINDFUL JUST TELL US YOUR NAME YOUR ORGANIZATION OR WITH AND AS A CHAIR AND MEMBERS ARE QUESTIONING KAYLEE ON BEHALF OF KHN TV THE COMPUTING TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION AND I WANT TO BRING TO YOUR ATTENTION. ON THE LAST PAGE OF THE LA OF ANALYSIS IS THE TAX REVENUE SOLUTIONS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS PROPOSED AND I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT WHILE THE STATE HAS IN PREVIOUS BUDGET- DOWNTURNS SUSPENDED THE NET OPERATING LOSS DEDUCTION AND LIMITED- THE USE OF TAX CREDITS IN THE PREVIOUS. INSTANCES WHERE FOR TWO YEARS THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES THREE SO WE'D LIKE YOU TO RE VISIT THAT. AND MAYBE DO A TWO YEAR INSTEAD OF A THREE. THE OTHER POINT IS THAT THERE WAS SOME SORT OF TRADE OFF IF YOU WILL ON THE BACKEND. FOR EXAMPLE AFTER THIS FIRST IN AWHILE SUSPENSION. WE DID A AN INCREASE FROM 60% UTILIZATION TWO HUNDRED PERCENT. AND THEN IN THE SECOND SUSPEND CAN AN UPDATE NINE. WE DID A TWO YEAR CARRY BACK. SO WE WOULD URGE YOU TO ENTER SOME ALTERNATIVES AND THAT ARE TAKING. CARE.
