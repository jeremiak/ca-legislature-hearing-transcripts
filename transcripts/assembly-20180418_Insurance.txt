WELCOME THANK YOU. THANK YOU CHAIR AND MEMBERS I AB NINETEEN TWENTY THREE COMES AT A TIME WHEN MY DISTRICT VENTURA AND SANTA BARBARA COUNTIES ARE STILL VERY MUCH DEALING WITH OUR DISASTER BETWEEN THE THOMAS FIRE AND SUBSEQUENT MUDSLIDES. WE LOST TWENTY TWO LIVES AND WELL OVER A THOUSAND STRUCTURES INCLUDING RESIDENCES AND BUSINESSES. DEBRIS REMOVAL FOLLOWING A FIRE IS ABSOLUTELY CRUCIAL NOT ONLY TO TRANSPORTATION TO GETTING BACK TO NORMAL BUT ALSO FOR HEALTH AND SAFETY. THE DEBRIS IN ASH FROM RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL FIRES CONTAINS HAZARDOUS MATERIALS CREATED THROUGH THE BURNING OF SYNTHETIC AND TOXIC MATERIALS. WE HAVE FOUND FROM PAST FIRES BUT IF CONSOLIDATED DEBRIS REMOVAL HAPPENS AS OPPOSED TO INDIVIDUALS PAIN PRIVATE CONTRACTORS DEBRIS REMOVALS HAPPENS FASTER AND AT A LOWER COST OVERALL. HOWEVER WE HAVE SEEN ISSUES IN THE PAST WHERE INSURANCE COMPANIES DID NOT END UP COVERING DEBRIS REMOVAL OR DISCOURAGE INDIVIDUALS FROM PARTICIPATING IN THE CONSOLIDATED DEBRIS REMOVAL PROGRAM. IN ORDER TO CLARIFY CONCERNS AND STREAMLINE THE RECOVERY PROCESS. THE BILL WILL ENSURE THAT IF PRESIDENTIAL PROPERTY OWNER HAS AT INSURANCE OF VIOLENT IF THEY CAN VOLUNTARY PARTICIPATE. IN A CONSOLIDATED DEBRIS REMOVAL PROGRAM IN EFFECT AT THE TIME OF THE WILDFIRE THAT INSURANCE WILL COVER COSTS FROM THE CONSOLIDATED DEBRIS REMOVAL. FOLLOWING A DISASTER AND WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE DOING ALL THAT WE CAN TO HELP RETURN TO A SENSE OF NORMALCY TO THE LIVES OF OUR COMMUNITIES AND REMOVE. ROADBLOCKS TO REBUILDING. WITH ME TODAY I HAVE ROBERT HERSELF FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE AS WELL AS AYE TONY'S SIGNAL. SINGER ALI. FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE LA. BEFORE WE FOR WE HEAR FROM MR HER WELL. I WANT TO REFER. TO PAGE THREE OF THE ANALYSIS. MISLIM MONA. WE HAVE DISCUSSED. THE COMMITTEE RECOMMENDED AMENDMENTS. THIS BILL YOUR BILL IS A VERY IMPORTANT SUBJECT THE BILL HAS REAL VALUE. I DON'T WANT TO SEE IT FAIL TODAY. SO I'D LIKE TO WERE SUGGEST TO OUR COMMITTEE THAT. WE INCLUDE THE AMENDMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN RECOMMENDED BY OUR. OR COMMITTEE STAFF. THE AMENDMENTS HAVE BEEN DISTRIBUTED. SO JUST TO. THINGS MOVING I'M GONNA GO AHEAD AND. MOVE. TO. INCLUDE THE AMENDMENTS. LISTED ON PAGE THREE. THERE'S A MOTION AND SECOND SO WILL. WELL HOLD THAT THAT MOTION AND THEN WE'LL GO AHEAD AND HEAR FROM THE. FROM YOUR WITNESSES GO AHEAD MR AROUND A GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS ROBERT WORLD THAT THE COMMISSIONER FOR LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE. AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER LIMON MENTIONED. WE'VE GOT A UPWARDS OF A DECADE OF EXPERIENCE NOW WITH THESE CONSOLIDATED. DEBRIS REMOVAL PROGRAMS AFTER DISASTERS WORKING WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES AND OTHER RELEVANT ENTITIES. OUR THE KNOWLEDGE THAT WE HAVE HAS COME A LONG WAY IN THE PAST TWENTY THIRTY YEARS ABOUT. A FOR EXAMPLE AFTER THE DEVASTATING FIRES LAST YEAR THE TOXICITY OF SOME OF WHAT HAS BURNED UP A AND A TORN ASUNDER THESE COMMUNITIES LIKE THAT OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER OF THE MOUNT. AND SO A WHERE THE SPONSOR OF OF THIS MEASURE IT'S INTENDED TO REALLY CODIFY WHAT HAS BEEN FOR THE PAST ALMOST DECADE THE CURRENT PRACTICE WE SHOULD NOTE THAT THE CURRENT PRACTICE AND THIS BILL. IT'S VOLUNTARY ON THE HOMEOWNER NO HOMEOWNER IS BEING COMPELLED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE CONSOLIDATED DEBRIS REMOVAL PROCESS IF THEY DON'T WANT TO WE SHOULD ALSO NOTE THAT THIS IS BEEN. HISTORICALLY A WIN WIN WIN. IT'S BETTER FOR THE HOMEOWNER. OUR BECAUSE THINGS GET DONE FASTER AND IN MANY CASES AT SCALE ALSO OF THE DEBRIS IS REMOVED UP OF MORE MORE CHEAPLY GENERALLY SPEAKING. IT'S BETTER FOR THE INSURER. BOTH TIME FRAMES AND ECONOMICALLY AND IT'S BETTER FOR THE LOCAL ENTITY OR OTHER STATE OR FEDERAL ENTITY THAT'S OVERSEEN THE DEBRIS REMOVAL THAT COULD BE IN MANY CASES IT'S THE LOCAL COUNTY. OR COUNTIES DEPENDING ON THE SIZE OF DISASTER OR OTHERS I WOULD JUST NOTE. THROUGH A THROUGH THE CHAIR ON THE AMENDMENTS THAT THE THERE'S A A HANDFUL OF THINGS THAT TO CONCERN US THAT WE SHOULD JUST WANTED TO MENTION FOR THE RECORD. UNDER CURRENT LAW. THE REGULATION TO SIX NINE FIVE POINT ONE EIGHT THREE OF THE CALIFORNIA COURTREGULATION DEBRIS REMOVAL IS CONSIDERED A PART OF REPLACEMENT BECAUSE. AND WHEN YOU COMBINE THAT WITH CURRENT LAW. TO A FIVE ONE POINT FIVE AT THE INSURANCE CODE FOLLOWING THE DECLARED DISASTER. COUNTY OR WHATEVER THE IN AGENCY IS THAT IT'S PICKING CONTROL DEBRIS REMOVAL HAS TWO YEARS. TO LET THE INSURER KNOW WHAT THE COSTS ARE. IT'S ONE YEAR IF IT'S NOT A DECLARED DISASTER THESE AMENDMENTS WOULD TAKE THAT. TWENTY FOUR MONTHS IN A DECLARED DISASTER AND CUT IT DOWN TO SIX WE FEAR THAT WHAT THE IMPACT OF THAT WILL BE TO SHIFT WHAT SHOULD BE PRIVATE INSURER COSTS. OVER ONTO PUBLIC ENTITIES SUCH AS COUNTIES WHICH WILL ALREADY BE STRAPPED FOR RESOURCES IN DEALING WITH. THE DISASTER THAT JUST OCCURRED OR THE RELEVANT STATE OR FEDERAL AGENCY THAT MAY COULD BE ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS OR WHOEVER THAT MAY BE OVERSEEING THAT. WE WILL ALSO JUST POINT OUT THAT WE FEEL LIKE THE IMMUNITY LANGUAGE. WE DON'T DISAGREE WITH THE NOTION THAT INSURERS ARE TO BE IMMUNE FOR ACTING IN GOOD FAITH IN THIS AREA FAR FROM IT. BUT WE DO BELIEVE THAT THE IMMUNITY LANGUAGE THAT'S IN THE AMENDMENTS THAT I SAW LATE LAST NIGHT. IS OVERLY BROAD AND COULD THEORETICALLY PROVIDE IMMUNITY TO ENSURE OR JUST FOR THE ATTEMPT TO TRY TO. A COMPLY AS OPPOSED TO ACTUALLY COMPLYING. SO WE DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS WITH THE AMENDMENTS HOPEFULLY THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT COULD BE. I DEALT WITH OVER TIME. BECAUSE WHICH IS THAT THE MEMBER SHOULD KNOW ABOUT SHIFTING THESE COSTS ON TO LOCALS IS PROBABLY OF CONCERN. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER BURRELL. AND NOW YOU HAVE ANOTHER WITNESS MUSLIM. GO AHEAD SIR. MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS TONI CINDERELLA DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE OP I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING MORE TO ADD FOR THE DEPARTMENT OTHER THAN TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE. THANK YOU SIR THANK YOU. DE MISLIM OWN I DIDN'T GIVE YOU A CHANCE TO COMMENT ON THE AMENDMENTS BUTTA I'M I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE OKAY WITH THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS SO I THINK THAT WE SHARE THE SAME OUR CONCERNS ABOUT THE AMENDMENTS AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS AN IMPORTANT BILL AND. AND TO MOVE IT FORWARD AYE THE AMENDMENTS ARE WHAT THEY ARE A HOPE THAT WE ARE ABLE TO HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT SOME OF THE DETAILS AND THE AMENDMENTS I'M AT THAT I THINK. ARE IMPORTANT. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT MATTER TO YOU AND TO THE DISTRICT YOU REPRESENT AND. AND CERTAINLY WILL CONTINUE TO DISCUSS SO. ANY ASPECT THAT YOU LIKE TO DISCUSS. WERE OPEN TO DISCUSSION THINK IF I THINK TO HAVE NOTHING TO MOVE FORWARD IN A. IN AN EXPEDITIOUS WAY THIS IS IS THE MASTER. FOR THE TIME BEING. THANK YOU MISS LAMONT FARTHER ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS ON. ON THE MOTION. MISTER GRAYSON. THAT THANK YOU CHAIR OF GOING BACK TO OF THE SIX MONTHS BECAUSE THAT CAUGHT MY ATTENTION IT'S CURRENTLY TWENTY FOUR MONTHS IT'S TWENTY FOUR MONTHS ASSEMBLY MEMBER IN THAT. UNDER DECLARE DISASTER A GUBERNATORIAL HE DECLARED DISASTER IN A NORMAL NON DISASTER SITUATION WHERE THERE'S TO REMOVE NECESSARY IT'S TWELVE MONTHS SO IN EITHER CASE YOU EITHER CUTTING IT FROM TWENTY FOUR TO SIX. IN A DISASTER OR TWELVE TO SIX AND A NON DISASTER BUT WERE OBVIOUSLY FOCUSING ON THE DISASTER. BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THESE CONSOLIDATED DEBRIS REMOVAL PROGRAMS TEND TO OCCUR GOT IT SO. EVEN ONLY IN IN MY MIND I'M THINKING WHAT WHILE SIX MONTHS FROM THE TIME OF OF REMOVAL FROM THE TIME OF COMPLETION SEEMS LIKE. THAT'S PRETTY ADEQUATE TIME BUT WHY IS IT THAT YOU WOULD YOU WOULD SAY SIX MONTHS IS TOO SHORT OF A TIME IS IT. BUT I MEAN IF I'M CLEANING OFF A PIECE OF PROPERTY. BUT. IF I UNDERSTAND RIGHT WE'RE NOT TALKING THAT JUST A SINGLE PIECE OF PROPERTY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IN SOME CASES MULTIPLE CONTRACTORS OR GROUPS THAT ARE HANDLING THE DEBRIS REMOVAL. AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IT'S LESS THAN CRYSTAL CLEAR IN THE LANGUAGE THAT'S GOING INTO THE BILL. WHAT? REMOVED ON YOUR PROPERTY REMOVED THE WHOLE THE WHOLE SWATH OF THE DISASTER AREA AT MY COLLEAGUE MISTER CIGNA RALLY CAN MAYBE TALK ABOUT THIS EVEN A LITTLE BIT MORE. YES ON ESSENTIALLY THE DEBRIS GETS REMOVED THREE TO FOUR MONTHS DOWN THE ROAD AFTER THE DISASTER RIGHT AND SO IT WOULD BE THREE TO FOUR MONTHS. PLUS THE SIX MONTHS SO LET'S SAY IT'S FOR EVEN FIVE MONTHS DOWN THE ROAD PLUS THE SIX MONTH THAT'S ELEVEN MONTHS. SO AT A MINIMUM IT'S REDUCE THIS BILL WOULD REDUCE THE TIME FRAME FROM THE CURRENT TWENTY FOUR MONTHS. TO TWELFTH TWO ELEVEN TWELVE MONTHS. AND IN ADDITION THAT TWENTY FOUR MONTHS IS. AFTER THE FIRST ACTUAL CASH VALUE PAYMENT IS MADE WHICH IS USUALLY SIXTY DAYS DOWN THE ROAD FROM THE DISASTER SO TECHNICALLY UNDER CURRENT LAW THERE'S ABOUT A TWENTY SIX MONTH PERIOD OF TIME. FOR THE INSURER TO SUBMIT THE CLAIM TO THE INSURANCE COMPANY AND STILL RECEIVE THE FULL BENEFIT OF THE INSURANCE POLICY SO ASSEMBLY MEMBER RAMONA IT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE THERE. THERE'S DEFINITE SOME ROOM THAT YOU COULD. THAT YOU NEED DON'T WORK ON HERE TO MAKE SURE THAT OTHERS ADEQUATE TIME. RIGHT AND THAT'S OUR HOPE AND JUST TO GIVE AN EXAMPLE IN LAKE COUNTY FOR THE TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN FIRES IT TOOK THEM ENTIRE TWO YEARS EVERY COUNTIES IN A DIFFERENT SPACE. TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO GET THAT INFORMATION. AND THE DEBRIS I THINK THAT YOU KNOW I HAD A A COLLEAGUE TO COME TO MY DISTRICT IN JUST A COUPLE WEEKS AGO. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF DEBRIS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT GOLDEN GATE YELL SIZE FULL OF DEBRIS SO IT'S IT'S A MUCH MORE COMPLICATED PROCESS AND I THINK HAVING HAD A COUNTY IN TWENTY FIFTEEN. AND THAT TOOK THE ENTIRE TWO YEARS I'D TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT I THINK EIGHT AT IT LENDS A CASE FOR REALLY REEXAMINING THE SIX MONTH IS THE RIGHT. AMOUNT OF TIME I MEAN THIS IS ONE OF MULTIPLE ISSUES THAT HAPPENED SO. OBVIOUSLY THERE'S SOME WORK TO BE DONE I'M GOING TO SUPPORT YOUR BILL TODAY IS JUST ALVY WATCHING IT AS THAT. GOES THROUGH. AND. THEY HAVE A DEPOSITION LATER. THANK YOU MISTER GRAYSON I'D LIKE TO GIVE UP OR COMMITTEE CONSULTANT AND. OPPORTUNITY TO COMMENT ON YOUR QUESTION AND. AND SOME OF THE DETAILS I THINK IT JUST A LITTLE BIT OF CLARIFICATION SO THAT THE IN YOU DID KNOW CORRECTLY. THE SIX MONTH PERIOD ISN'T. A TIME FRAME IN WHICH DEBRIS NEEDS TO BE REMOVED AND ITS NOT A SIX MONTHS PERIOD THAT BURDENS. THE POLICYHOLDER. SIX MONTHS PERIOD FOR THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT AFTER IT'S COMPLETED ITS WORK SEND A BILL TO THE INSURANCE COMPANY. BEFORE WE EVEN ENDED THIS A POLICY HOLDER HAS ALREADY. AGREED TO THE PROCESS AND ASSIGNED THE RIGHTS TO THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS OF THE BURDEN ON THE POLICY HOLDER COMMENT FRANKLY IS NOT WELL TAKEN. EXCELLENT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MEMBERS WE HAVE A MOTION AND SECOND TO. YES. MISTER COOLEY. YOU KNOW I THINK. LOOKING BACK AT THIS OF COURSE TO THE REMOVAL ON A LARGE SCALE WAS FIRST DONE HALF THE OAKLAND HILLS FIRE. TO. CORD AND PROGRAM ELIHU HARRIS FORMER SENATOR FORMER MEMBER THIS BODY. WAS THEN MAYOR WORKING ON THAT. AND THIS SORT OF SCALE I MEAN THE WAY THESE PROGRAMS WORK ACTUALLY. AT THE LOCAL LEVEL THE AT TO FIGURE OUT WHERE THEY'RE GOING TO PUT THE DEBRIS. SIMPLY IDENTIFIED WHAT IS THE PLACE OF DEBRIS WILL BE REMOVED TO THAT THAT ITSELF IS A PART A PLAN. THAT ADDS TO THE LEAD TIME. THERE HAS TO BE YOU HAVE TO KIND OF PAVED THE WAY. FOR THE REMOVAL TO START TO HAPPEN. SENATORS A LOT OF WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH A DISASTER THERE IS A LOT OF SCALE INVOLVED AND THERE IS A LOT OF. GET EVERYTHING LINED UP. BEFORE DEBRIS REMOVAL HAPPEN. SO I DO THINK THIS IDEA THAT. YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A PROCESS OF IN SHE LOTS WILL BE CLEARED. AND OUR NEEDS TO BE SOME INFORMING IN A TIMELY WAY BUT EVEN SIX MONTHS. EVERYONE A PROTEST IT'S GOING TO HAVE A CHANCE GET THEIR SYSTEMS IN ORDER. THE COUNTIES A COURSE ADMINISTER THEIR PROPERTY TAX RULES SAY NO THE. AP ENDS FOR THE PROPERTIES THERE'S A LOT OF WORK THAT'LL. KIND OF. EASE THE WAY FOR THIS. AND THEN WITH RESPECT THE AMENDMENTS I JUST WANNA KNOW THAT. ONE THING'S A CAUGHT MY EYE UPON READING THE BILL'S I JUST KIND OF WENT THROUGH IS THAT OPT IN PROVISION. AND OPTIM PROVISIONS ARE ACTUALLY NOT THE SIMPLEST THING TO OPERATE. A HEARING CALIFORNIA AFTER THE LOMA PRIETA EARTHQUAKE THEY PASSED THE CALIFORNIA RESIDENTIAL EARTHQUAKE RECOVERY FUND WHICH HAD AN OPT IN PROGRAM PARTICIPATE. AND WITHIN TWO YEARS. BECAUSE THE OPT IN MECHANICS HAVE NOT BEEN WORKED OUT. THAT WAS REPEALED AND OF REPEAL OF LED BY AN INSURANCE COMMISSIONER. JOHN GARAMENDI. SO I ACTUALLY FEEL THAT THE AMENDMENTS THAT ARE OFFERED. BREAKING IT DOWN TO. MORE SPECIFIC MECHANICS OF. IF SOMEONE WANTS TO OPT IN THE MEMORIALIZED BY PROVIDED FOR THE TO COUNTY WHICH INCLUDE SHARED WITH THE. INSURERS OF THE SERVICE HOWEVER KNOWS WHAT THE RULES ARE. IS ACTUALLY SORT OF SWEATING THE DETAILS. THAT IS VERY APPROPRIATE FOR POST DISASTER ENVIRONMENT. TO EXPLAIN HOW THE MECHANICS OF OP THAT ACTUALLY WORK AND WHO'S IN WHO'S DOT HOUSE MEMORIALIZED AND SET UP A WORKABLE PROCESS. SO I'VE TO. PRE SHOULD READ THE AMENDMENTS I THINK THE. THEY ARE RESPONSIVE NOT JUST TO THE ISSUE BUT. OUR HISTORY ARE THE STATUTES. GOOD THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER COOLEY FOR THOSE COMMENTS. MEMBERS WE WILL HAVE A ROLL CALL VOTE ON THE AMENDMENTS. AND THEN WE'LL DO A VOTE ON THE. ON ON THE BILL WITH THE AMENDMENTS ASSUMING THE AMENDMENTS ARE INCLUDED SO ROLL CALL VOTE PLEASE ON THE AMENDMENTS. DALY AYE DALY AYE MAY. MAYES I BIGELOW.

HE'S GONE SO HE COULD SEE IF IT. WELCOME. WHERE IT IS HERE? YES ON THE INTERNET. WELCOME IS BURKE. BIGELOW CHAIR. DALY. AND MEANS FOR ALL TIME. THIS IS A SIMILAR ISSUE THAT WE LOOK AT LAST YEAR. BEFORE YOU IT'S A RESULT OF COUNTLESS HOURS OF STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS. AND YOU KNOW DRIVING IN CALIFORNIA IS NOW MORE EXPENSIVE THAN EVER WE MANDATE INSURANCE WE HAVE HIGHER GAS PRICES THE NATIONAL AVERAGE AND DRIVERS ARE SPENDING MORE TIME ON THE ROAD DUE TO LONG COMMUTES TO WORK. THE RISING COSTS OF CAR REPAIRS ISRAEL AND COULD ULTIMATELY LEAD TO HIGHER INTEREST ASSURANCE PRICES FOR OUR CONSTITUENTS. LET ME BE VERY CLEAR ABOUT THE INTENT OF THIS BILL IT DOES NOT UNDUE THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE REGULATIONS ON LABOR RATE SURVEYS BUT RATHER PROVIDES A STATUTORY METHOD. THAT COMPLEMENTS THE EXISTING DEPARTMENT REGULATIONS FOR INSURERS TO USE IN THE SURVEYING AUTO BODY REPAIR SHOPS TO DETERMINE THE PREVAILING. THE PREVAILING AUTO BODY RATE LABOR RATE IN PARTICULAR IN GEOGRAPHIC AREAS INSURERS ARE NOT REQUIRED BY LAW TO CONDUCT A LABOR EIGHT SURVEY AND MANY INSURERS DO NOT CONDUCT ELABORATE SORRY. AND MY BILL ACKNOWLEDGES THAT. BUT ENSURE THAT DO CONDUCT A VOLUNTARY LABOR RATE SURVEY USE IT AS A TOOL FOR TWO MAIN REASONS. THE FIRST IS TO FIGURE OUT WHAT A FAIR PRICE TO PAY IN A LOCATION FOR A STANDARD REPAIR JOB AND THE SECOND IS TO PRINT PROVED TO THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE. THAT THEY'VE ACTED FAIRLY IN THE EVENT OF PAYING AUTO BODY REPAIR SHOPS COME. WITH THEIR COMPLAINTS TO THE OTHER FROM THE AUTO BODY REPAIR SHOPS. AB TWENTY TO SEVENTY SIX WILL PROVIDE A BALANCED APPROACH AND IS ANOTHER METHODOLOGY TO CONDUCT A VOLUNTARY LABOR RATE SURVEY. SPECIFICALLY THIS BILL REQUIRES A SURVEY AT TO HAVE A RANDOM MINIMUM A THIRTY QUALIFIED SHOPS OR THIRTY PERCENT OF GEOGRAPHIC LOCATIONS WHICH OF ITS GREATER. THE SURVEY RESULTS MUST BE FILED WITH THE DEPARTMENT EVERY TWELVE MONTHS. AUTO BODY REPAIR SHOPS INCLUDED A SURVEY MUST MEETS BUT SPECIFIED EQUIPMENT INSURANCE AND LICENSING REQUIREMENTS TO AVOID INCLUDING THE UNDERGROUND ECONOMY. ADDITIONALLY THE BILL SPECIFIES DETAILED QUESTIONS THAT MUST BE ASKED ON THE SURVEY THEY ARE IN STATUTE IN THIS BILL. WITH REGARDS TO GREG GEOGRAPHIC AREAS THAT MAY BE SURVEYED I PROPOSE THREE DIFFERENT OPTIONS RIGHT NOW. ASSEMBLY DISTRICT BOUNDARIES AT THE GEOGRAPHIC AREAS AS DEFINED IN THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE REGULATIONS. CONTINUES ZIP CODES WITHIN THE BOUNDARIES OF LOCAL WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AREAS AS ESTABLISHED BY THE EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT ARE THE THREE THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT. THESE GEOGRAPHIC AREAS HAS BEEN DISCUSSED EXTENSIVELY IN OUR STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT POINT OUT THAT. AS WE CONTINUE TO FINE TUNE THIS BILL CURRENTLY THE DEPARTMENT HAS SIXTEEN LABOR EIGHT SURVEYS ON FILE. AND THE GEOGRAPHIC AREAS USED RANGE FROM TWENTY ONE TO THIRTY NINE AREA STATEWIDE. AND MOST OF THEM BREAK UP LA INTO SMALLER AREAS RANGING FROM ABOUT ONE TO TWELVE AREAS. AYE THAT'S SERGEANTS TO PASS THAT INFORMATION OUT TO YOU SO THAT YOU HAVE A RECORD OF THAT. I'VE YOU'RE PREVAILING LABOR IT SURVEYED DETERMINED BY ITS SURVEY TO BE THE STARTING POINT OF A NEGOTIATION BETWEEN AN AUTO BODY SHOP ANY INSURER. I HAVE EVEN INCLUDED LANGUAGE IN THE BILL THAT ALLOWS BOTH PARTIES TO NEGOTIATE A HIGHER OR LOWER RATES. THE BILL ALSO STATES THAT THE SURVEY PREVAILING RATE SHALL NOT BE THE MINIMUM NOR THE MAXIMUM RATE FOR ANY SPECS SPECIFIC CLAIM IT'S SIMPLY A STARTING POINT TO BEGIN NEGOTIATIONS. THANK YOU FOR AYE. FOR ALLOWING ME THE TIME TODAY TO REALLY GO THROUGH THIS BILL IT'S A COMPLICATED ISSUE AND WE SPENT LIKE I SAID A LOT OF HOURS ON IT. WITH ME TODAY I'M I HAVE A FEW WITNESSES. THERE'S A MOTION AND SECOND TO END THOUGH NOW WILL GO TO YOUR WITNESSES SAY MISTER GUNNING PLEASE GO AHEAD THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MICHAEL GUNNING PERSONAL INSURANCE FEDERATION. OF FIRST OFF I JUST HAVE TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER BURKE. HER PERSEVERANCE AND PERSISTENCY IN THIS PROCESS. THERE IS A LEVEL INVOLVEMENT THAT WE RARELY SEE HERE AND WANT TO THANK YOU PALM SHE SHE WAS AT ALL THE MEETINGS CRACK OF THE WHIP MAKING SURE WE MOVE FORWARD. MISTER CHAIRMAN OTHER MEMBERS THANK YOU OF COURSE FOR JOINING ON IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. OF THIS IS CLEARLY A SLIMMED DOWN VERSION OF. I AB SIXTEEN SEVEN ON WHICH PASSED LAST YEAR. YOU'RE GONNA HEAR SOME OPPONENTS COME UP HERE AND I THINK SOME MEMBER BURKE IS ALREADY OUTLINED THE CHANGES WE'VE MADE BUT THIS DOES NOT REPLACE THE DEPARTMENTS REGULATIONS THE DEPARTMENT STILL HAS THEIR REGULATIONS. THIS COMPLIMENTS THOSE REGULATIONS IN ALLOWS INSURERS TO PERFORM A SURVEY IN A DIFFERENT METHODOLOGY AND AS YOU HEARD SURVEYS ARE VOLUNTARY AND MAJORITY OF INSURERS DON'T TO HIM. WE'VE TAKEN A NUMBER OF AMENDMENTS TO THIS BILL SO AND MY FRIEND JACK MADONNA GETS APPEARANCE SAYS NO. HE'S GOTTEN EVERYTHING ARE BILLS NOT WHAT WE SAW LAST YEAR. AND OF COURSE THE OTHER THING IS STATED IN THE ANALYSIS STEERING HAS BEEN REMOVED FROM HERE AND SO IT'S STILL THE LAW THAT CONSUMERS HAVE TO BE TOLD WHERE WOULD THAT THEY CAN GET THEIR CAR REPAIRED AT ANY SHOP WE'RE NOT TRYING TO DICTATE. WHERE IT IS SO THIS IS A MODEST PROPOSAL THAT WE THINK WILL HELP KEEP CONSUMER PREMIUMS LOW AND WE URGE AN AYE VOTE? THANK YOU SIR PLEASE GO AHEAD. CHAIR OF THE MORNING OUR MONTHLY SHOT ON BEHALF OF. PROPERTY CASUALTY INSURERS I TOO WOULD LIKE THINGS AND THE MOVE BURKE. FOR ADDRESSING MANY ISSUES RAISED BUT AUTO DEALERS HOW CAR MANUFACTURERS AND THE BODY SHOP'S. THE BILL IS NECESSARY TO ADDRESS THE RISING COST OF CAR REPAIRS IN CALIFORNIA. AND IT DOES PROVIDE ALTERNATIVES FOR INSURERS TO CONDUCT FAVORITE SURVEY OTHER THAN WHAT THE DEPARTMENT ADOPTED. IT IS A PRODUCT OF A. LONG MANY HOURS IN THE GOSHI ASIANS AND COMPROMISES SO WITH THAT RESPECT WE I WOULD LIKE AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MR FELICIANO OTHER PERSONS WISHING TO SPEAK IN FAVOR OF THE BILL. CATHERINE PAPER AMERICAN INSURANCE ASSOCIATION AND THE SUPPORT OF THE BILL THANK YOU. SHERRI MCKEE REPRESENT THE PACIFIC ASSOCIATION OF DOMESTIC INSURANCE COMPANIES AND SUPPORT ABOUT. CHAIRMAN MEMBERS JOHN NORWOOD ON BEHALF OF THE INDEPENDENT INSURANCE AGENTS OR BROKERS WERE SUPPORT THE BILL GIVEN. EDWIN LOMBARD REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA BLACK CHAMBER OF COMMERCE BLACK BUSINESS ASSOCIATION BAY PACK IN THE CALIFORNIA BLACK PASTORS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. THANK YOU SIR. ANY OTHER PERSONS WISHING TO SPEAK IN FAVOR OF THE BILL. TERRELL. MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS ROB HER OUT WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE WE. AS OF THIS MOMENT DO NOT HAVE AN OFFICIAL POSITION ON THE BILL. WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT I HOPE THE AUTHOR AND OTHERS APPRECIATE. THE MAGNITUDE OF THAT ARM I WHICH IS NOW IN THE ANALYSIS COMMON NUMBER TWO TALKS ABOUT AND THE AUTHOR TALKED ABOUT THIS LENGTHY STAKEHOLDER PROCESS FOR THE RECORD IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT. THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE WAS EXPLICITLY EXCLUDED FROM THAT STAKEHOLDER PROCESS UP UNTIL TWO WEEKS AGO WHEN WE ATTENDED OUR FIRST MEETING OF THE STAKEHOLDERS. AND SO I THINK THE MEMBERSHIP JUST BE AWARE OF THAT. AND THE MEETING THAT WE DID ATTEND I THOUGHT WAS A PRODUCTIVE ONE AND WHILE WE HAVE NO POSITION ON THIS BILL RIGHT NOW WE DO HAVE A NUMBER OF CONCERNS ON ISSUES THAT WERE TO LET THE PROCESS PLAY OUT. AND SEE HOW THOSE GET HANDLED. IF PEOPLE WANT IT I HEAR MORE ABOUT SOME OF THE DETAILS OF THOSE CONCERNS MY COLLEAGUE MISTER CIGARETTE ONLY. WHO HAS SPENT HUNDREDS AND THOUSANDS OF HOURS ON THIS ISSUE WAS MORE THAN HAPPY TO DETAIL THAT BUT IN THE SAKE OF TIME FOR NOW UNLESS NECESSARY? I THINK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU MISTER HER RAIL. STILL ADD UP BUT NOT ON SUPPORTERS ANYMORE SUPPORTERS. OKAY. ALRIGHT THE. I'M I'M A TWEENER SAYS NOW THE RAIN I'M OKAY WERE ON TWEENER TIME RIGHT NOW THANK YOU GO AHEAD SIR AYCLIFFE COSTS AND WE HAVE TO CALIFORNIA NEW CAR DEALERS ASSOCIATION. THE NEW CAR DEALERS REALLY APPRECIATE SPONSOR THE AUTHOR THE STAFF YOUR STAFF SENATE STAFF. ASSEMBLY APPROPRIATIONS STAFF WE'VE HAD AS YOU'VE ALREADY HEARD A VERY LONG PROCESS. THROUGH THAT PROCESS NEW CAR DEALERS WERE ABLE TO ACHIEVE AGREEMENTS ON A NUMBER OF POINTS I. WILL SAY TO YOU IT'S CLOSE TO SEVENTEEN. AND SO WE REALLY APPRECIATE THAT WE CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR THE SPONSORS AND THE COMMITTEES ARE TO CONTINUE TO FINE TUNE SOME OF THAT LANGUAGE BUT WITH THAT WE ARE VERY HAPPY TO BE. ALRIGHT. AND NOW A IF THERE ARE NO MORE TWEETERS WILL GO TO THE OPPONENTS S. IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE TO. CA. IN A FOCUSED. FAIRLY BRIEF WAY. PLEASE GO AHEAD. GOOD MORNING THANK YOU. JACK MADONNA FROM BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA AUTO BODY ASSOCIATION AND I WANT TO START OUT FIRST BY THANKING ASSEMBLY. LOVE MEMBER BURKE FOR HUH HER EFFORTS AND OUR STAFF TO THEY HAVE SPENT A LOT OF TIME AND EFFORT IN TRYING TO ADDRESS ALL OUR CONCERNS. AND YOU HAVE ADDRESSED MANY OF THE CONCERNS. BUT UNFORTUNATELY THEY'RE STILL. SOME OUTSTANDING ISSUES. AND WE'VE OUTLINED IN OUR LETTER BUT. SO WITH THAT BUT I WANT TO SAY THAT THE AUTO BODY ASSOCIATION AND THE MEMBERS. HAVE ALWAYS SAID THE POSITIONS ALWAYS BEEN IF AN INSURANCE COMPANY WANTS TO DO A SURVEY. AS LONG AS IT'S FAIR AND REASONABLE THERE OKAY WITH IT THAT'S REALLY THEIR POSITION HAS ALWAYS BEEN FAIR AND REASONABLE. UNFORTUNATELY. THE BILL STILL DOES NOT QUITE. ADDRESSED THOSE ISSUES THAT WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT NOW ARE JUST FOCUS ON ONE ISSUE I KNOW A YOU MENTIONED THE OF THE TIME FRAME BUT I'M GONNA FOCUS ON THE GEOGRAPHICAL ISSUE BECAUSE THAT'S REALLY THE MOST CONTROVERSIAL IN THE MAJOR ISSUE HERE. AND I KNOW IT'S BEEN OUTLINED IN THE. COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. SO THE GEOGRAPHICAL ISSUE. DE AND I KNOW THE ASSEMBLY WOMAN IS TAKEN SOME AMENDMENTS TO INCLUDE. THAT THE ASSEMBLY DISTRICT BE IN THE GEOGRAPHICAL AREA WE HAVE CONCERNS WITH THAT. FIRST OF ALL. ASSEMBLY DISTRICTS HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH. THAT THE BODY SHOP'S OF MORE IMPORTANTLY THE ASSEMBLY DISTRICT IS VERY LARGE IT INCLUDES A DIFFERENT CITIES AND DIFFERENT LOCAL MARKETS AND COUNTIES. AND SO FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE IT'S IT'S UNFAIR FOR CERTAIN SHOPS BODY SHOPS THAT ARE IN HIGH RENT DISTRICT. OF OR MAYBE IN AN AREA IN THIS PARTICULAR CITY THAT THEY HAVE TO PAY HIGHER MINIMUM WAGE TO BE COMPARED WITH OTHER SHOPS IN A LARGER AREA MAYBE THE COUNTY. WHERE THE LOWER THE RATES ARE CLEAR THE RENTS ARE LOWER SO WHEN YOU DO AN AVERAGE? WHAT HAPPENS IS THE SHOPS THAT? ARE IN THE LOW RENT DISTRICT ARE CHARGING LESS BUT IF YOU DO AN AVID THEY END UP GETTING A WINDFALL IN THE SHOPS THAT CHARGE MORE. END UP GETTING PAID LESS AND SO THAT IS THE DILEMMA THAT'S WHAT WE. THAT'S REALLY THE ISSUE WERE STRUGGLING WITH WE'VE ASKED FOR SOME SORT OF. PROCESS TO AT LEAST COMPENSATE THE SHOP TO HAVE TO PAY MORE. BECAUSE OF ECONOMIC REASONS FOR HIGHER RENT AND THAT'S WHAT WE'VE SORT OF WE'VE BEEN STRUGGLING WITH WE BASS WERE PARTICULAR RANGE OF RATES MAYBE. OF THAT ARE REASONABLE. BUT THIS IS THE STRUGGLE AND THIS IS THE REASON WHY WILL CONTINUE TO BE OPPOSED TO THE BILL SO. WITH THAT SAID. AGAIN WE WE WANT TO THANK THE. THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER FOR ALL OUR EFFORTS BUT WE CONTINUE TO REMAIN A REMAIN OPPOSED TO THE BILL THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU SIR. OTHER OTHER PERSONS WISHING TO SPEAK AGAINST THE BILL. MATT BROUGHT WITH PRODDING GAS MANY HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CONFERENCE MACHINISTS WERE OPPOSED TO THE DEL RESPECTFULLY. I'M WE THINK THAT EXISTING SEE I REGULATION IS STRONG IT KEEPS LABOR RATE WHERE THEY NEED TO BE. ARM SO WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE PERSONNEL THANK YOU. MORNING CARVALLO WITH THEIR NONDESTRUCTIVE TO GRIP ON BEHALF OF THE CONSUMER FEDERATION CALIFORNIA ALSO POST. ANY OTHER PERSONS WISHING TO OPPOSE THE BILL. THEY ARE NONE COMMITTEE MEMBERS QUESTIONS FOR MS BERKELEY AUTHOR. IF NOT A MISS BURKE YOU CAN CLOSE THINK YOU AYE IF YOU KNOW JACK THAT WAS ACTUALLY VERY TEMPERATE SO I WANT TO THANK HIM. FOR HIS. TEMPER HAVE A POSITION. AS FAR AS THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE AYE WE HAVE MET WE MET EARLIER. WE MET THE RECENTLY AND IT WAS ACTUALLY EXTREMELY PRODUCTIVE AND WE CONTINUE TO WE LOOK FOR TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THEM. UP ON THE GEOGRAPHIC AREAS THE REASON WE GIVE YOU THE DATE IS BECAUSE RIGHT NOW AS IT STANDS THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE ONLY USES ABOUT TWENTY ONE TO THIRTY NINE GEOGRAPHICAL AREAS EIGHTY IS ACTUALLY MORE. SO THE AREAS WOULD BE SMALLER SO AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON GEOGRAPHICAL AREAS ALSO I AS FAR AS NEGOTIATING PRICE THE REASON WE NEVER DECIDED ON A RANGE WAS BECAUSE WE PUT IN THE BILL THAT THERE IS NO MINIMUM AND NO MAXIMUM. THE IS THE STARTING POINT AND THEN THEY NEGOTIATION AND FOR THAT MACHINE IS OPPOSITION I BELIEVE WE'VE ADDRESS OUR ISSUES AND OTHER ACTUAL ISSUES IN THE BILL HOWEVER BECAUSE THERE IT'S AN ADDITIONAL A FORM OF. COMING TO LIBERATE SURVEY THAT'S OUTSIDE THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE% CURRENTLY BELIEVE THAT'S WHY THEY CONTINUE TO BE OPPOSE OUTSIDE OF THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR LIBEL. GOOD THANK YOU VERY MUCH MS BURKE. IF THERE ARE NO OTHER QUESTIONS BY COMMITTEE MEMBERS LET'S GO AHEAD AND VOTE. DALY BY DALY AYE MAYES. MAYES I'VE BIGELOW. BIGELOW AYE OF THE ARROW.

THINK YOU GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN COLLEAGUES. I'M. IT'S A MATTER OF WHEN AND NOT IF A MAJOR EARTHQUAKE OCCURS IN CALIFORNIA WE'VE ALL HEARD THAT. UNFORTUNATELY ONLY ABOUT TEN PERCENT OF CALIFORNIANS HAVE EARTHQUAKE INSURANCE. MOST OF IT IS OFFERED THROUGH THE CALIFORNIA EARTHQUAKE AUTHORITY THE NOT FOR PROFIT INSURANCE PROVIDER ESTABLISHED BY THE LEGISLATURE IN THE WAKE OF THE DEVASTATING NORTHRIDGE EARTHQUAKE OVER TWENTY YEARS AGO. WHILE C. A. NOW IN SHORTS MORE THAN ONE MILLION HOUSEHOLDS IN THE STATE. FAR TOO MANY OF OUR CONSTITUENTS THE LACK FINANCIAL PROTECTION FOR THE NEXT DAMAGING EARTHQUAKE. AB TWENTY NINE TWENTY SEVEN CLARIFIES CURRENT STATUTE TO ALLOW THE C. A.. TO PLACE A SURCHARGE ON THEIR POLICY HOLDERS PREMIUMS BUT ONLY IN THE EVENT OF AN EXTREMELY LARGE UNPRECEDENTED EARTHQUAKE. IT IS UNLIKELY THAT SURCHARGE WILL EVER BE NEEDED. IT WOULD TAKE AN EVENT TOUR THREE TIMES THE SIZE OF WHAT NORTHRIDGE EARTHQUAKE WAS IN ORDER TO GET TO THAT POINT. HOWEVER THE VERY EXISTENCE OF THIS CAPABILITY WILL ALLOW THAT C. A. TO REDUCED AMOUNT OF REINSURANCE. THANK YOU IT MUST THE RELY ON IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO BE PREPARED FOR THE ONE IN THE FOUR HUNDRED EVENT OF AN EARTHQUAKE. THERE THIS BILL IS STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS.

MILESTONE. OKAY TREASURE THIS MOMENT. GILLETTE YEAH. I'M NOT GONNA SAY ANYTHING ELSE ON TEN TO TWO. NOW WE'RE DOWN TO OUR LAST BILL OF THE. OF THE MORNING MISTER CALDERON IS BILL. IT IS SO. AB TWENTY THREE NINETY FIVE. OUR AUGUST COMMITTEE COLLEAGUE. MISTER CALDERON PLEASE GO AHEAD. THANKS RESEARCH GOT EASY BILL TECHNO TIME AT ALL. AB TWENTY THREE NINETY FIVE WILL REQUIRE LONG TERM CARE INSURANCE TO SUBMIT MORE DETAILED FINANCIAL INFORMATION TO THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE. AND REQUIRE CLEAR GET TO ASSESS AND REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE ON ITS CAPACITY. TO HANDLE PROTECTIVE LONG TERM CARE ENSURE. INSOLVENCY AS LONG TERM CARE INSURANCE IS VITALLY IMPORTANT FOR INDIVIDUALS AND FOR FAMILIES. IT PROVIDES IMPORTANT FINANCIAL PROTECTION AND HELPS PEOPLE MAINTAIN DIGNITY AND INDEPENDENCE IN THEIR LATER YEARS ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE THAT MAY NOT BE ABLE TO CARE FOR THEMSELVES DUE TO CHRONIC ILLNESS DISABILITY. OR COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT SUCH AS ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE. THE COST OF LONG TERM CARE SERVICES CAN BE SIGNIFICANT AND IT IT IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE. IN AN UPWARD TREND THE MEDIAN COST OF A ONE YEAR STAY IN A PRIVATE NURSING HOME IS MORE THAN NINETY THOUSAND DOLLARS IN TWENTY YEARS THE SAME STAY WILL COST MORE THAN A HUNDRED SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. WITHOUT LONG TERM CARE INSURANCE MOST PEOPLE WOULD HAVE TO. PLEASE THEIR SAVINGS IN ORDER TO COVERED SUCH COSTS. ACTUALLY WAS IN THE CASE OF MY GRANDMOTHER. AND TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN PENN TREATY A LONG TERM CARE INSURANCE PROVIDER WENT BANKRUPT. FORTUNATELY CONSUMERS THAT HAD PURCHASED PANTRY PLANS WERE NOT LEFT WITHOUT COVERAGE OR A OUT THE MONEY THEY HAD THOUGHTS FAR INVESTED THANKS TO THE CALIFORNIA LIFE AND HEALTH INSURANCE GUARANTY ASSOCIATION ALSO KNOWS CLICK. CLEAR GUY IS AN ASSOCIATION OF ALL INSURANCE COMPANIES LICENSE TO SELL LIFE INSURANCE HEALTH INSURANCE AND ANNUITIES IN CALIFORNIA IT WAS ESTABLISHED BY STATUTE IN NINETEEN NINETY ONE JUST WEEKS BEFORE. EXECUTIVE LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY WAS DECLARED INSOLVENT LEGAL WAS CREATED WITH THE INTENTION OF GIVING POLICY HOLDERS OF INSOLVENT COMPANIES A GUARANTEED. SOURCE OF PAYMENT. THE GAP BETWEEN PAN TREATIES ASSESSED ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. WE'LL HAVE TO BE MADE UP THROUGH ASSESSMENTS ON DISABILITY INSURERS WHICH IN CALIFORNIA ARE ULTIMATELY PASSED ON TO POLICY HOLDERS TO SURCHARGES. ESTIMATES SHOW THAT CALIFORNIA POLICY HOLDERS WHO ULTIMATELY PAY FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AND SURCHARGES RELATED TO THE PANTRY INSOLVENCY. THOSE SURCHARGES WILL ENSURE THAT APPROXIMATELY EIGHT THOUSAND PENN TREATY POLICY HOLDERS IN CALIFORNIA WILL BE ABLE TO GET THEIR CLAIMS PAID PANTRY DE. PUT THE CHALLENGES IN THE LONG TERM CARE INSURANCE MARKET AND OUR INSURANCE GUARANTEE SYSTEM INTO FOCUS. AB TWENTY THREE NINETY FIVE AS IT IS BEFORE YOU TODAY IS LIMITED TO PREVENTION AND PREPAREDNESS THIS BILL ATTEMPTS TO HEAD OFF POTENTIAL INSOLVENCY BY REQUIRING ROBUST REPORTING TO THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE. AND PROVIDES INFORMATION ON KLAY GETS CAPACITY TO PROTECT CONSUMERS IN THE EVENT THAT INSOLVENCY TAKES PLACE I WANT TO THANK ALL OF THE MANY STAKEHOLDERS OUT OF ENGAGE IN CONVERSATIONS ON THE GUARANTEE ASSOCIATION UP TO THIS POINT. I KNOW THERE IS MUCH DEBATE ABOUT HOW TO ENSURE LONG TERM CARE INSURANCE CONSUMERS ARE PROTECTED IN THE CASE IN CASE OF A FUTURE INSOLVENCY. AND LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING THOSE DISCUSSIONS I'VE WORKED A LOT ON ENSURE LONG TERM CARE INSURANCE. EL LONG TERM CARE INSURANCE ISSUES. AS A MILLENNIAL I FEEL LIKE THIS IS A MILLENNIAL ISSUE MY PARENTS ARBED OUR GENERATION OUR PARENTS WERE PUT IN A POSITION. TO HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE RECESSION AND YOU KNOW LIKE WHAT HAPPENED WITH MY FAMILY THEY LOST THEIR BUSINESS IN THEY LOST THEIR HOME THEY SPENT ALL OF THEIR RETIREMENT SAVINGS ALL OF THE AL EVERY SINGLE DOLLAR THEY HAD TO TRY TO KEEP THE BUSINESS ALIVE AND THEY STILL. LOST EVERYTHING SO THERE IS NO RETIREMENT FOR THEM AND SO WHO DOES THAT COSTS FALL ON. IF THEY DON'T HAVE THE MONEY TO PAY FOR IT FALLS ON THE KIDS IT FALLS ON US. AND THIS IS A PLAN UP THIS THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY OFFER KLAY GOT THIS THIS ASSOCIATION GUARANTEED ASSOCIATION EXISTS. IF A COMPANY DOES NOT. PROPERLY MANAGE THERE FUNDS AND THEY GO INTO AN INSOLVENT SITUATION THESE PEOPLE ARE NOT JUST LEFT OUT THIS FUND IS A GUARANTEE FUNDING MAKE SURE THAT THEY CAN CONSIST CAN STILL GET THEIR. THEIR GUARANTEE OF OF POLICIES AND AGAIN THIS IS PAID BY ALL THE COMPANIES THAT ARE PAYING INTO OUR OUR LONG TERM CARE INSURANCE PROVIDERS AND THEY ONLY PAY IF A COMPANY GOES INSOLVENT. AND SO THIS BILL JUST PROVIDES PROTECTION SAYING YOU KNOW YOU'RE TO REPORT AS AN INSURANCE COMPANY. THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE AND THEN PLEASE GO ALSO HAVE TO REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE TO MAKE SURE THAT THEIR SOLVENT THAT THEY CAN HANDLE IF THERE ISN'T INSOLVENCY TAKING ON THESE NEW CLIENTS. AND ALSO GIVEN THE ABILITY ARE OF THE ALL THESE NEW CLIENTS THAT THEY'RE TAKING ON CLAY GOT TO ASSESS A NEWRATE. AYE IF THEY NEED TO TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY CAN COVER ALL OF LONG TERM CARE COSTS THAT THEY'RE GOING TO INCUR BECAUSE OF THE INSOLVENCY AND THE BAD ACTIONS OF A COMPANY. THAT DO THEIR ACTIONS PUT A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT SO THAT IS WHAT THE INTENT OF THIS BILL IS THAT IS WHAT THIS BILL IN ITS CURRENT FORM DOES TODAY. ARE AND SO WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO. URGE YOUR AYE VOTE IN SUPPORT OF THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE AND WITH ME TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF GENTRY AGAIN FROM THE ASSOCIATE WILL ACT LIKE. AND JOHN MILLION ON BEHALF OF AMERICA COUNCIL WHAT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS JOHN SHRIEKING AT THE ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA LIFE AND HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANIES AND WE ARE THE SPONSORS THAT THIS MEASURE. BEFORE I OFFER SOME REMARKS MISTER CHAIRMAN I WANTED TO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO THANK KIRA COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR VERY DETAILED AND THOUGHTFUL ANALYSIS. I KNOW THIS CAN BE A PRETTY COMPLEX. TOPIC AND I THINK THEY DID A GREAT JOB AND SUMMARIZING THE ISSUES SO. THANK YOU FOR THAT. AS SUMMER CALDERON POINTED OUT THE MOTIVATION FOR THIS BILL WAS THE INSOLVENCY OF A PENNSYLVANIA LONG TERM INSURER UNNOTICED PANTRY. HE SOLD ROUGHLY EIGHT THOUSAND POLICIES TO CALIFORNIANS AND UNFORTUNATE WASN'T ABLE TO KEEP THOSE PROMISES. AS MISTER CALDERON REFER TO THANKFULLY WE HAVE MECHANISM TO DEAL WITH SITUATIONS LIKE THIS IN THE FORM OF THE CALIFORNIA LIFE AND HEALTH GUARANTY ASSOCIATION OR CLICK HERE. AFTER PANTRIES INSOLVENCY QUICKEST THAT DAN AND LOBBIED ASSESSMENTS ON A GROUP OF HEALTH AND DISABILITY INSURERS TO RAISE THE FUNDS NEEDED TO MAKE POLICIES. HOLDERS WHOLE. IN THIS CASE THE SYSTEM WORKED AND PANTRY HOLDER TAKEN CARE OF AND NOW THE DUST IS SETTLED WE'VE HAD SOME TIME TO REFLECT THE COUPLE ISSUES WERE. BROUGHT TO OUR ATTENTION. THE FIRST ISSUE IS THE NEED FOR MORE FINANCIAL OVERSIGHT OF LONG TERM CARE INSURERS IN ORDER TO HELP OUR REGULATORS IN THEIR EFFORTS TO DETECT AND PREVENT ANY FUTURE INSOLVENCY. THOUGHT PROCESSES PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD THE BETTER IF WE CAN DO A BETTER JOB. OF DETECTING PREVENTING INSOLVENCY IS THEN ALL TALKS A FUTURE ASSESSMENTS BECOME PURELY ACADEMIC. SO FIRST LINE OF OF OUR OUR FIRST KIND OF. DEFENSE IS TO MAKE SURE THESE GUYS DON'T EVER GO UNDER. THE SECOND ISSUE WE DISCOVERED WAS QUICKLY BECAUSE DWINDLING ASSESSMENT CAPACITY AND THE NEED TO REVISE THAT METHODOLOGY IN THE FUTURE. THIS POINT AGAIN SUMMARIZE ONE THE COMMITTEE OUT ANALYSIS NOW WILL GET TOO DEEP INTO DETAILS. AND FORTUNE WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO REACH A CONSENSUS POSITION ON THAT ISSUE BUT I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE ON IS WHAT'S A PARTY TODAY AND AB TWENTY TWO NINETY FIVE AND THOSE ARE THE GUARDRAIL PROVISIONS THAT. A SUMMER CALDERON JUST FOR REFERENCE. SO WITH THAT I RESPECT WE ASK FOR AYE VOTE AND HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS THAT MEMBERS MIGHT HAVE. THANK YOU SIR AND OF THE NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE JOHN MANGAN AND I'M REGIONAL VICE PRESIDENT FOR THE AMERICAN COUNCIL OF LIFE INSURERS WERE THE NATIONAL TRADE GROUP.

IT MARIN CHAIR MEMBERS MITCHELL AS ON BEHALF RIGHT HOW FINANCIAL AND SUPPORT THANK YOU. IT ANY OTHER PERSONS IN FAVOR OF THE BILL. IF NOT ARE THERE PERSONS SPEAK AGAINST THE BILL. WELCOME. WELCOME. MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS THANK YOU VERY MUCH THERESA STARK WITH KAISER PERMANENTE AND WE ARE ACTUALLY NOT IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL BEFORE YOU ACTUALLY. SHARE THE AUTHOR IN THE SPONSORS POLICY GOALS TO PROTECT THAT POLICYHOLDERS HERE AND THAT WE ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT WHERE THE BILL IS HEADED. I ONCE IT LEAVES THIS HOUSE AND WE WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR THE CONVERSATIONS WE'VE HAD A HE AND HIS STAFF HAVE BEEN VERY ACCESSIBLE AND HAVE LISTENED. I'M A LOT TO US SO WE APPRECIATE THAT BUT AS OUR LETTER STATES I THIS BILL AS A VEHICLE FOR A VERY CONTROVERSIAL PROPOSAL THAT IS BEING PUSHED BY. THE LARGE NATIONAL HEALTH INSURERS IN ORDER TO PULL H. M. O.'S OUR HEALTH CARE SERVICE PLANS INTO INSURANCE GUARANTEE ASSOCIATIONS IN ORDER TO HELP PAY FOR LONG TERM CARE INSOLVENCY EASE. THAT'S NOT IN THE BILL BUT IT'S VERY CLEARLY THE PLAN FOR THE BILL. AND WE KNOW THIS FOR SEVERAL REASONS THE MEMBER COMPANIES OF THE SPONSOR HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN PUSHING THIS I EXACT LANGUAGE IN SIXTEEN OTHER STATES. THEY MOVED IT FORWARD AT THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS AND ACTUALLY THAT THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS IS I AGREE IS A VERY GOOD ANALYSIS AND IT'S ACTUALLY VERY TELLING BECAUSE I THINK ABOUT ONE THIRD OF THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS ACTUALLY DISCUSSES. THIS ACTUAL PROPOSAL THE ENDING I SEE PROPOSAL I TO PUT H. M. O.'S IN THE GUARANTEE ASSOCIATION. AND AND THE SPONSORS LETTER ALSO MAKES IT CLEAR THAT THAT IS SOMETHING THEY ARE INTERESTED IN SO THERE REALLY IS NO MYSTERY HERE WE WE KNOW WHAT THEIR GOAL IS SO. WE FELT IT WAS IMPORTANT TO MAKE A FEW COMMENTS ABOUT THAT AND BRING TO YOUR ATTENTION I THE FACT THAT THIS BILL MAY LOOK VERY DIFFERENT OF ONCE IT LEAVES THIS HOUSE. WE WANT TO BE CLEAR WE AGREE THAT THERE IS A POLICY PROBLEM HERE IT IS UNACCEPTABLE THAT THE HEALTH INSURERS ARE HEALTH INSURER COLLEAGUES HAD TO PAY THE FULL FREIGHT. OF FOR THE PENN TREATY ASSESSMENT BUT IF IT'S A GUARANTEE ASSOCIATION IS BROKEN IF IT'S NOT WORKING ANYMORE AND IS NO LONGER ADEQUATELY PROTECTIVE. OF POLICY HOLDERS THAT WE NEED TO FIX THAT IN NOT REARRANGED AT THE DECK CHAIRS ON THE TITANIC SO. THE REALITY IS THE ONLY PROPOSAL THAT WE HAVE TO REACT TO SO FAR AND IN OUR TO STAKEHOLDER CONVERSATIONS HAS BEEN. UP THIS PROPOSAL AND IT ACTUALLY WOULD BE A TAX HEARING CALIFORNIA OF THE PROPOSAL BECAUSE THERE IS NO NEXUS BETWEEN H. M. O.'S AND GUARANTEE ASSOCIATIONS I WOULD ACTUALLY TRIGGER ATTACKS. AND BE A TWO THIRDS VOTE HERE AYE IN CALIFORNIA AND KAISER PERMANENTE JUST HAS TO FUNDAMENTALLY OBJECT TO ANY PROPOSAL THAT WOULD TAX OUR MEMBERS FOR A BUSINESS THAT WE'RE NOT IN. A IN FOR MARKET FAILURES THAT THEY HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH SO AT THE OTHER HEALTH INSURERS MAY BE COMFORTABLE DOING THAT. ON ONTO THEIR MEMBERS BUT BUT WE'RE NOT COMFORTABLE WITH THAT SO WE JUST WANTED TO RAISE THAT ISSUE. ESPECIALLY AT A TIME WHEN THE HEALTHCARE MARKETPLACE IS ALREADY VERY SHAKY. AYE COST CONTAINMENT AND AFFORDABILITY IS A IS A HOT TOPIC RIGHT NOW IN HEALTH CARE THIS IS NOT THE TIME TO BE CONSIDERING A NEW TAX ON HEALTH CARE SERVICE PLANS. I'M THERE ARE OTHER WAYS TO SKIN THIS CAT WE CAME UP WITH FOR A OTHER IDEAS THAT HAD SOME SOME MERIT IN AND REALLY CONSTRUCTIVE THOUGHT WERE HAPPY TO CONTINUE TO BE. AT THE TABLE IN AND HELP OUR HEALTH INSURER COLLEAGUES I FIGURE OUT THIS PROBLEM. BUT AGAIN IF THE GUARANTEE ASSOCIATION ISN'T THE RIGHT STRUCTURE ANYMORE WE CAN WE CAN WORK ON THAT SO FOR THESE REASONS MISTER CHAIRMAN WE FELT IT WAS IMPORTANT. TO BRING THAT UP. TO DATE TO BRING UP OUR CONCERNS AND HOPES OF BETTER UNDERSTANDING WHAT THE AUTHORS. I IN SPONSORS INTENTIONS ARE FOR WHEN I HAD THE BILL DOES LEAVE THIS HOUSE AND WE'D LIKE TO SOME REASSURANCE WE UNDERSTAND THAT HE IS INTERESTED IN AND DEVELOPING CONSENSUS BUT WE'D LIKE TO HEAR THAT THAT IS. HIS ULTIMATE GOAL I TO GET TO CONSENSUS AND A AND A GOOD PLACE I'M ON THE SENATE SIDE AND IF WE COULD GET THAT COMMITMENT TODAY THAT WOULD BE A VERY HELPFUL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. GO AHEAD SIR MISTER CHAIRMAN THE MEMBER SCOTT WHICH IN BEHALF OF MALINA HEALTH CARE. A WE SHARE THE SAME CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN VOICED BY KAISER RURAL IN A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT POSITION IN THAT. AS YOU KNOW MISTER CHAIRMAN MOLINA IT TRADITIONALLY HAS NO COMMERCIAL LINES. AT ALL. IT'S BEEN STRICTLY IN THE MEDI CAL MEDICARE SPACE RECENTLY WE TOOK ON ABOUT EIGHTY THOUSAND ENROLLEES IN THE EXCHANGE AT THE REQUEST OF THE ADMINISTRATION. SO UNDER THE. RUBRIC OF NO GOOD DEED GOES UNPUNISHED BY TAKING ON THOSE VERY FEW ENROLLEES WE WOULD BE SUCKED INTO. THE PROPOSED A HEALTH PLAN TAX. AND. AS YOU KNOW IN CALIFORNIA HEALTH PLANS. I'D MILENA DOES NOT PROVIDE NOR CAN WE PROVIDE. LONG TERM CARE INSURANCE US SO BEING THAT WERE STRICTLY FOR THE FOR ALL INTENSIVE PURPOSES IN THE GOVERNMENT SPACE WE DON'T HAVE THE CAPACITY. SPREAD THIS COST LIKE THE OTHER PLANS DO ACROSS A BROAD BASE OF OF. CONSUMERS AND SO ANY HIT THAT MARINA TAKES A COULD BE ABSOLUTELY DEVASTATING TO OUR ABILITY. TO PROVIDE THE CARE THAT WE DO BECAUSE OUR MARGINS ARE SO SMALL. SO FOR THOSE REASONS. WE ARE VERY CONCERNED WITH THE BILL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ARE THERE OTHER PERSONS SIR. WISHING TO SPEAK AGAINST THE BILL. PLEASE GO AHEAD. GOOD MORNING MEMBERS MY NAME'S JOANNE CAMPBELL I'M HERE FOR LA CARE I JUST LIKE TO ECHO THE COMMENTS AND CONCERNS THAT ARE MADE BY MY COLLEAGUE. THANK YOU ANY OTHER PERSONS AGAINST THE BILL QUESTION SEE MR GRAYSON REACHING FOR HIS BUTTON THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR QUESTIONS. THANK YOU CHAIR AND I ESPECIALLY WANT TO THANK. ASSEMBLY MEMBER CALDERON FOR YOUR HARD WORK AND PUTTING THIS TOGETHER VERY VERY IMPORTANT. AND IF I UNDERSTAND THE TESTIMONY CORRECTLY IN YOUR PRESENTATION IN YOUR PRESENTATION YOU'D MENTIONED THE IMPORTANCE OF WHAT THE BILL DOES AS FAR AS OVERSIGHT. AND PREVENTION. AND DOUG THEN YOU DIDN'T DRESS IN MORE OF A CONVERSATION PIECE. THE NEED TO GIVE ATTENTION TO THE ISSUE OF ASSESSMENT. AND THEN IN THE TESTIMONY OF THE SPONSOR. YOU MADE IT CLEAR THAT THIS BILL IS SIMPLY OVERSIGHT AND PREVENTION. AND HAD MENTIONED THAT ASSESSMENT WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE DISCUSSED FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD. SO IS THE BILL. IT IS THIS BILL ABOUT OVERSIGHT AND PREVENTION I SEE IT AS A THREE LEGGED STOOL ALL THREE OF THEM NEED ALL THREE OF THEM NEED TO BE ADDRESSED. BUT IF I UNDERSTAND IT CORRECTLY THE BILL TODAY IS ONLY ADDRESSING WITH TO THOSE LEGS AN THAT'S OVERSIGHT AND PREVENTION AND NOT SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSING ASSESSMENT IS THAT RIGHT YOU'RE CORRECT. BUT SO IF IF THAT'S THE CASE SPEAK. BUT. I UNDERSTAND THAT THE ASSESSMENT CONVERSATION IS GONNA BE A SEPARATE CONVERSATION THAT HAPPENS. A IF I UNDERSTAND WHEN YOU WERE MY OFFICE THAT JUST THE OTHER DAY WE WERE TALKING SOMETIME DOWN THE ROAD NEXT YEAR OR WHATEVER THE CASE MIGHT BE. WELL WE'VE ALREADY HAD A CONVERSATION WHERE I HAD A LARGE STAKEHOLDER MEETING AND AND ONE OF THE ROOMS DOWNSTAIRS BY ALL THE OTHER COMMITTEE ROOMS. AND SO YOU KNOW. THE FIRST TWO LEGS WERE ADDRESSING IN THIS BILL BECAUSE I THINK THAT THAT'S WHERE A LOT OF CONSENSUS IS ON WE WOULD LIKE. TO FIND THE SOLUTION ON THE THIRD PIECE ABOUT IT AS I WAS AS I SAY TO THEM IN THAT MEETING AYE AND AGAIN HAVE NO PROBLEM STATING I'M TRYING TO FIND SOMETHING THAT WE CAN ALL AGREE ON BECAUSE IT'S ABOUT THE GREATER GOOD. I THINK YOU KNOW ULTIMATELY IT'S ON ALL OF US TO TAKE ON A LITTLE BIT TO TRY TO TO FIX A LARGER PROBLEM BUT THAT IS NOT WHAT THIS BILL IS. IS DOING TODAY THIS IS ABOUT PREVENTION IN BEING PREPARED TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE PEOPLE THAT ARE PAYING INTO THESE PLANS THAT ARE THAT WOULD NEED LONG TERM CARE INSURANCE AT THAT COMPANY IS IRRESPONSIBLE THEY GO OUT OF BUSINESS. WHAT HAPPENS ALL THESE PEOPLE ARE CONSTITUENTS WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT AT LEAST GIVING THAT DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE IN THE LEGISLATURE MORE INFORMATION SO THAT WE CAN HAVE THESE PROTECTIONS IN THAT THESE PEOPLE ARE NOT JUST LEFT OUT HIGH AND DRY? YET WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO HAVE THE CONVERSATION ON EGGS ON ASSESSMENT BUT LET'S BE CPAS BE VERY CLEAR THE GOAL IS TO GET A SIGNATURE ON THIS BILL AS IT STANDS BECAUSE THIS PROVIDES. A LOT OF PROTECTIONS TO A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT ARE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT THAT'S THE GOAL IF WE CAN MAKE HEADWAY ON THE OTHER ISSUE SURE WILL INCLUDED IN BUT GUESS WHAT HAPPENS IT COMES BACK TO THIS COMMITTEE BECAUSE. IT'S A MAJOR POLICY CHANGE AND THEN I GET CALLED IN TO HELP. OUR THAT INTO THE HEALTH COMMITTEE SO IT'S NOT LIKE A CUT LEAVE THIS COMMITTEE AND IT NEVER COMES BACK IF WE MAKE THAT CHANGE COMES BACK THIS COMMITTEE AND GOES AND GOES BACK IN HEALTH. SO IT'S NOT LIKE THIS IS SOME EASY THING THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN ALL IN BY THE WAY IF THE TAX REQUIRES A TWO THIRDS VOTE WHICH IS GONNA BE SO EASY ON THE FLOOR. GRANTED UPGRADED COUNTY VOTES BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN IT'S GOING TO BE EASY SO YOU KNOW THIS IS. YOU KNOW THIS IS THE ISSUE THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH AT HAND IT'S IT'S ABOUT PREPARE PREVENTION AND PREPAREDNESS. AND AND IT'S A GREAT BILL IN ITS UPON ISSUE. YOU KNOW RETIREMENT SECURITY IS REALLY IMPORTANT AND I'M A BIG BELIEVER THAT IF YOU'RE CONTRIBUTING AND YOU'RE TRYING TO BE PREPARED AND THAT THE ACTIONS OF A COMPANY. BEING IRRESPONSIBLE DIDN'T TAKE THE PROPER MEASURES TO PROVIDE THOSE PROTECTIONS. MAN I JUST DON'T THINK PEOPLE SHOULD BE SCREWED BECAUSE OF. I FEEL YOUR PASSION THANK YOU. OTHER QUESTIONS. FOR THE AUTHOR MISTER FRAZIER. THANK YOU MISTER CALDERON FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND AGAIN. I CAN APPRECIATE YOUR PERSONAL INTEREST BECAUSE OF YOUR GRANDMOTHER. AND. AS AN EMPLOYER FOR THE LAST TWENTY THREE YEARS CRIED BECAME. A LEGISLATOR. I PAID EVERY INSURANCE IN THE BOOK. A FOR MY EMPLOYEES THROUGH WORKMEN'S COMP. LIABILITY INSURANCE. NO ONE OF THE THINGS IS THAT I WAS LIKE I NEVER HAD A CLAIM ON ANY OF THOSE EVEN UNEMPLOYMENT. BUT FOR ALL THE MONEY THAT I SPENT I NEVER GOT A REBATE ON ANY OF IT. OKAY. AND SO. KNOWING THAT SIGNAL WAS A A SAFETY NET FOR ENSURING. OF THROUGH A LOT OF THE OTHER POLICY CENTER ISSUED. I GAVE ME A LEVEL OF COMFORT AS AN EMPLOYER. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT CONCERNS ME AND AGAIN I KNOW THAT THERE HAS TO BE A SAFETY VALVE. IF IF A. SAFETY NET IS NOT A ADEQUATE OF BUT REPORTING TO LEGISLATURE TO ME. HE KIND OF A. KIND OF A. LIKE A LOT PASS OFF. WHERE IS THE INDUSTRY ITSELF SHOULD BE A SELF GOVERNED AND MAKE SURE THAT BAY? ARE CAN CAN. APPROPRIATELY COVER THEIR LOSSES LIKE WHEN PEOPLE LOST MONEY IN THE STOCK MARKET IN IT AS YOU SAID IN A DOWNTURN. NOBODY WAS FREAKED RECALL BEEN SATED FOR THAT IT WAS COMPLETE LOSS AND WE JUST WENT AND WE TOOK OUR LUNCH SO WE KEPT GOING. OUR INDUSTRY HAS THE ABILITY TO TAKE THE RISK BUT ALSO HAS OF ABILITY TO MAKE A LOT OF MONEY. AS YOU SAID THIS IS A VERY VERY LUCRATIVE. OF AREA WHEN IT'S UP BECAUSE IT'S SO EXPENSIVE. SO I'M I'M I'M CONCERNED ABOUT. YOU KNOW HERE I CAME INTO THIS JOB AS A LEGISLATOR. I PAID ONLY INSURANCE PREMIUMS ARE PAID HEALTH INSURANCE FOR MY EMPLOYEES. BUT WE DON'T GET INSURANCE MEDICAL INSURANCE IN THIS JOB. I'M CONCERNED IF THERE IS A SAFETY VALVE THAT PUTS IN OFF ON THE H. M. O.'S OR OR ANY OF THE PLANS WHAT'S GONNA COST ME. THE COVER THAT INDUSTRY. WHAT'S IT GONNA COST AND I'M ALSO A UNION MEMBER. WHAT'S GONNA COSTS MY UNIONS FOR HIGHER PREMIUMS TO COVER THAT INDUSTRY SO I'M CONCERNED ABOUT. YOU KNOW. EVERYTHING THAT WE DO TRICKLES DOWN TO THE CONSUMER. THEY DON'T JUST TO. ABSORB IT THEY HAVE TO PASS IT ON. SO CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT'S GOING TO COST ME MY UNION MEMBERS IF IT IF THIS GOES FORWARD. OF BECAUSE THEY'RE ALWAYS IN THIS BUILDING CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE PAYING FOR THEIR MEMBERS AS FAR AS GOING FOR A MINUTE TRYING TO PROTECT THAT. A SORT IF THAT GOES FORWARD I LIKE TO KNOW WHAT THE COST WOULD BE TO THE CONSUMER. SO IT'S AN INFORMED. VOTE AS YOU SAY WHEN YOU BRING IT TO THE FLOOR BACK HERE. BECAUSE YOU KNOW RIGHT NOW. WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO AS FAR AS? PROTECTIONS ON THOSE TO EXISTS AS A ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRAY SAID. ABSOLUTELY AGREE ABSOLUTELY AGREE AND AND TO PROTECT THE PEOPLE THERE THEIR. YOU KNOW PROVIDING COVERAGE FOR AND THE EXPECTATION. BUT THEY WILL. BUT YOU LOOK AT THE ALSO THE PEOPLE ARE PAYING FOR THIS INSURANCE AND IF THEY DIE SUDDENLY. CUT BACK ITS ABSORBED BY THE INSURANCE COMPANY AND I GET THAT IS OF VALUE. SO THE WORKS BOTH WAYS AND SOME LOOKING FOR DEBT. YOU WORKING WITH INDUSTRY AND AND I APPRECIATE AGAIN YOUR PERSONAL INTERESTS ARE AS A FORMER EMPLOYER. YOU KNOW I WANT THOSE PROTECT. NOW YOU AND I APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS IT AGAIN YOU AT THAT ISN'T IN THE BILL AND SO I AND I UNDERSTAND THE CONCERNS ONCE THAT PEACE IS THERE. BUT AGAIN THAT'S NOT WHY WE PUT WE THAT'S WHAT WE DID PUT THE PIECE IN THERE BECAUSE WE'RE TRYING TO REACH CONSENSUS ON ON THE O. OVERALL AGREEMENT IF THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'RE GOING TO DO. BUT AGAIN THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS BILL ULTIMATELY DIES AND AGAIN. IT'S GONNA COME BACK HERE AND HAVE TO GO TO HEALTH THE HEALTH. COMMITTEE ULTIMATELY IF THAT ASSESSMENT IS IS PLACED IN AND AGAIN IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND WHY. YOU KNOW FIRST WE GOT EVERY STATE HAS THEIR OWN GUARANTEED. ASSOCIATION THAT PLAN THAT THEY THAT THEY MANAGE AND SO I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THEY LEASE REPORT BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE. SO THAT WE UNDERSTAND THAT THEY HAVE AN ABILITY TO REPAY. OR TO PAY FOR THE THINGS THAT THEY NEED TO PAY FOR A ONCE IN THERE IS AN INSOLVENCY. THE MEMBER COMPANIES ONLY PAY IF THERE IS AN INSOLVENCY ARE WE CAN TALK ABOUT UNDER THE ACA. WHETHER ALL INSURANCE RETREAT INSURERS ARE TREATED THE SAME OR NOT BECAUSE EVEN WHEN YOU GO TO SIGN UP FOR THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT YOU GO ONLINE. IT DOESN'T DIFFERENTIATE IT'S EITHER MANAGED CARE THAT MEANS THERE IS NO DIFFERENTIATION TO PICK A PLAN THAT IS YOUR INSURANCE SO WE CAN HAVE THAT DEBATE ALL DAY LONG. UP BUT THERE USED TO BE OVER A HUNDRED PROVIDERS OF LONG TERM CARE INSURANCE NOW WE'RE DOWN TO TWELVE PROBABLY ELEVEN ACTUALLY BECAUSE PENN TREATY WENT OUT OF BUSINESS AND THAT'S WHY IT'S SO EXPENSIVE BECAUSE THERE'S JUST NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE THERE. SO WE REALLY ARE DEPENDENT UPON THESE FEW PROVIDERS YOU KNOW SIX OR SEVEN MAYBE EIGHT LARGE PROVIDERS IN THE REST PRETTY SMALL. OF OF MANAGING THEIR MONEY WELL AND MANAGING THEIR POLICIES WELL SO THAT THERE IS. CERTAINTY THERE AND SO TO REPORT BACK TO THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE IS IMPORTANCE OF A FROM MANAGERIAL AND PROTECTION STANDPOINT AND ALSO TO REPORT BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE IN AGAIN. GETS ALSO GETS CLICK AT THE ABILITY FOR THOSE CONSUMERS THAT THEY HAVE TO TAKE ON DUE TO THE INSOLVENCY. THEY MEET IT'S THAT YOU KNOW IF MRS WILSON IS PROBABLY PAYING TWELVE DOLLARS A MONTH. WELL MAYBE THAT'S A REASON WHY THAT'S THAT THAT BUSINESS WHEN INSOLVENT BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T CHARGING UP SO KLIEG AS A FIND A GUARANTEED ASSOCIATION FUND NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO MAKE AN ASSESSMENT OF SAYING OKAY. MAYBE WE NEED TO CHARGE A LITTLE BIT MORE SO I APOLOGIZE THAT YOUR RATE IS GOING TO GO UP BUT IN ORDER TO PROVIDE THAT GUARANTEE WE HAVE TO CHARGE MORE. THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE CAN STILL DECLINE THAT RATE INCREASE BUT THEY STILL HAVE THE ABILITY TO ASK IN THIS IS GIVING THEM THAT THAT ABILITY ASKING IT IS ON US TO MAKE SURE THAT. THEY ARE NOT ONLY CHECKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE BUT ALSO THE LEGISLATURE TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE INSOLVENCY UP OR THAT THEY CAN HANDLE ARE. YOU KNOW THEIR SITUATION AND THE SITUATION OF EVERYBODY ELSE THAT THEY'RE TAKING ON IN THE EVENT THAT THERE IS AN INSOLVENCY DUE TO BAD ACTORS. A BUT I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING AND AGAIN THAT'S RIGHT JUST NOT IN THE BILL RIGHT NOW BECAUSE YOU KNOW I'M. I ONCE NEGOTIATED A BILL FOR TWO YEARS I KNEW I HAD THAT THE VOTES ON THE FIRST GENERATION BECAUSE I CARE ABOUT CONSENSUS AND I CARE ABOUT. REACHING THAT YOU KNOW COMMONSENSE SOLUTIONS EH TO THE BEST OF OUR ABILITY SO I DON'T THINK ANY OF YOU NEED TO WORRY ABOUT MY ABILITY TO BE REASONABLE I TRY TO BE AS REASONABLE AS I POSSIBLY CAN. EVERYTIME UP SO YOU HAVE MY COMMITMENT I WILL NEED I WILL I WILL CONTINUE WITH THESE CONVERSATIONS ON THAT SIDE. IT OUT WITH GOOD INTENT AND ONLY PUT IT IN THE BILL IF I FEEL LIKE WE'VE WE SOME CONSENSUS. I APPRECIATE THAT AND KNOW ANYTIME AS A CONTRACTOR I TOOK RISK I HAD TO BOND. YOU KNOW TO TO ASSURE MY EITHER MY CLIENT OR OR THE AGENCY THAT I WAS WORKING FOR. THAT THAT WAS THAT IF I COULD NOT. COMPLETE THE PROJECT. THE BOND WOULD COVER ALL COSTS. AND MAYBE THE THE AGENCY THAT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SAFETY VALVE HAS SOME KIND OF ASSURANCE THAT YOU CAN ALSO DO THAT OTHER THAN GOING TO THE CONSUMER. THAT BEING SAID HERE I'M I'M CONCERNED ABOUT PROP ONE OR THREE ALSO WHEN INSURERS HAVE TO GO BACK. SOMETIMES AND I'VE BEEN TOLD THIS. THAT NOT ONLY HAVE THEY GONE FOR AN INCREASE BUT THEY'VE RECEIVED A DEDUCTION. THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT BECAUSE OF AND SO THEY TAKE A RISK EVERY TIME THEY GO THROUGH FOR THAT RATE INCREASE SO I. I I I I I HAVE I'M HESITANT WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT GOING FOR AN INCREASE. THE FATE THAT THEY ACTUALLY ALWAYS COME FORWARD AT LIGA. THAT MEANS THAT SPECIFICALLY THE GUARANTEED ASSOCIATION FUN NOT TO THE INSURANCE AT WORK TALK ABOUT WHAT I'M SAYING IS IS IS. YOU KNOW HIT HISTORY PREVAILS ITSELF HILL THROUGH OTHER THROUGHOUT WE DON'T GIVE THE IF WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT CHANGING THAT ON THE HEALTH UNDERSTOOD JUST SIMPLY NOT A GUARANTEED ASSOCIATION ASIDE FOR THOSE PEOPLE THAT THEY WERE FORCED TO TAKE ON. ABSOLUTELY AND BASIC I JUST BETTER ASSURANCES. MISS KIRBY HERO HAD. QUESTION OR COMMENT AND THEN MISTER COOLEY WILL FOLLOW. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR WELL I JUST AM I WANTED TO THANK AYES ARE IN MILLION HEALTH CARE FOR. UP PRESENTING TODAY. BEN AND I APPRECIATE YOUR EXPLANATION FOR HOW YOU'RE WORKING ON THE BILL. BECAUSE ON IT DOESN'T INCLUDE THE THINGS THAT THEY'RE CONCERNED ABOUT RIGHT NOW BUT IT'S GOOD TO SEE. ASSURANCE THAT. IT WILL BE DONE IN A WAY THAT. PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY EITHER TO COME BACK OR THAT YOU'RE LOOKING REALLY FOR A WIN WIN FOR EVERYBODY IN THAT. IT WILL BE ON A GOOD PROCESS SO I'M I'M PREPARED TO SUPPORT YOUR BILL ON I THINK IT'S A GOOD BILL. I I'M VERY CONCERNED WITH THE LACK OF OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE TO BUY INTO LONG LONG TERM CARE. UP MY MOTHER HAS ALZHEIMER'S AND SHE'S USING LONG TERM CARE AND QUITE FRANKLY UP WITHOUT IT SHE'D BE SELLING OFF ALL HER ASSETS IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE FOR HER CARE. AND WE MAY GET THERE WHEN IT WHEN IT IF AND WHEN THE LONG TERM CARE ENDS BUT I. LOOK AT THAT MY FATHER WAS VERY WISE IN BUYING THE POLICY. AND MY HUSBAND AND I HAVE BEEN VERY UNWISE AND NOT. BUYING A POLICY AND SO ON I THINK WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE LOOKING AT THE TSUNAMI OF OF SENIORS GETTING TO THE POINT WHERE THEY MAY NEED IT AND. AND TO HAVE IT AVAILABLE IS REALLY IMPORTANT THAT IT BE SOLVENT ISRAELI IMPORTANCE I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR BILL AND I'M AYE AYE MOVE I MEAN I MOVE THE BELL BUT I. I DO WANT TO SAY THAT I'M CONCERNED WITH THE SECOND PART OF IT AND IF YOU GET THERE. AND CAN WORK IT OUT THAT WOULD BE TERRIFIC TO. MISTER COOLEY. I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD AND I. JUST WANT TO SPEAK A LITTLE TO THE SUBSTANCE OF IT. AND I SORT OF FEEL LIKE WELCOME TO LAW MAKING FOR ALL OF US. THIS BILL INVOLVES THE GUARANTEE FUND. THE BASIC FUNCTION OF OUR INSURANCE SYSTEM THAT WE ARE GRAPPLING WITH HERE IS THE FIRST LINE OF DEFENSE FOR. FOR PROMISES BEING PAID IN EVERY INSTANCE IS THE RATES BEING PAID. IT'S NOT THE GUARANTEE FUND IS ADEQUATE RATES. THEN AND MAKE IN EVENT THAT FOR SOME REASON RATES. PROVIDE REVENUES INSURANCE COVER NOT ADEQUATE SO THEY END UP GOING INSOLVENT. THE SECOND LINE OF DEFENSE IS ALWAYS THE GUARANTEE FUND. AND AND THAT'S A BIG POLICY PUBLIC POLICY CHOICE. THAT'S TRUE IN THE NDIVIDUAL. GETTING SCREWED BECAUSE THE COMPANY WENT BANKRUPT THERE CAME CAN'T GET PAID. WE SOCIALIZE AT COST TO GUARANTEE FUND. THE COST CONTRIBUTED. SO WE ARE IN THIS ERA AS THE ANALYSIS WALK US THROUGH. THE LEGACY SYSTEM EARLY RATES FOR LONG TERM CARE WERE OPTIMISTIC. WE HAVE A PROBLEM OF IT'S AN EXPENSIVE TYPE OF COVERAGE. PEOPLE LIVING LONGER WHICH IS GREAT FOR THEM. BUT IT AFFECTS YOUR LIFE ASSUMPTIONS. SO WE NOW HAVE AN INSURANCE SYSTEM WHERE THERE ARE RISKS TO INSOLVENCY. SO AGAIN WHAT'S AMERICAN SOLUTION WE TRY TO CONCEPTUALIZE A GUARANTEE FUND A WAY TO DEAL WITH THAT. I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT. THE STATEOF THE LAW GENERALLY IN CALIFORNIA'S GOES BACK QUITE A WAYS IS THAT. YOU HAVE INSURANCE COMPANIES WHICH MAY PROVIDE HEALTH BENEFITS AND YOU HAVE HEALTH PLANS THE DRUGS ARE THE PART A MATCH HEALTH CARE. THAT SHE TWO DIFFERENT ENTITIES UNDER OUR LAW. SO WHILE I UNDERSTAND THE CONCERN BEING EXPRESSED BY. KAISER MOLINA. LARA AND OTHERS THEY ARE IN A DIFFERENT BODY OF LAW. SO IT ENDS UP FALLING INTO OUR LACK TO KIND OF GRAPPLE WITH THIS HOW DO WE PUT. HOW DO WE? HAVE A SYSTEM THAT SUPPORTS. NOT HAVING THE BURDEN OF INSOLVENT COMPANY FALL SINGLE IN AN INDIVIDUAL. AND. SO I ACTUALLY FEEL IT'S OF VERY APT BILL FOR MAJORITY LEADER TO BE TRYING TO ADVANCE A CONVERSATION TO BRING IT FORWARD. TO ENGAGE ASSAULT. ARE. I'M. ON THIS SORT OF THING I ALWAYS THINK OF A SERMON I HEARD WHEN I WAS EIGHTEEN. I. CREATURE CUENTA CHURCH US ANYMORE AND PRIESTS A SERMON ABOUT THE SEVEN LAST WORDS IN THIS CASE OF THE CHURCH. THE SEVEN LAST WORDS WERE THE LAST SEVEN THINGS OUR CHURCH WILL SAY. BEFORE IT'S GONE FOREVER. TURNED OUT THE SEVEN LAST WORDS OF THE CHURCHES WE'VE NEVER DONE IT THAT WAY BEFORE. AND SO WE DID IF WE ADOPTED THE FACE OF CHALLENGING ISSUES THIS DANCE WITH GOV DOT THAT WAY BEFORE. THEN WERE FOR A DEADLOCK. SO AS I SAY. A GOOD BILL NOT AN EASY BILL I SEE THAT THE ARGUMENT WHAT THE HOME BUT THAT INVOLVES WE GENERATE OUR LAW. IN A THOUGHTFUL WAY. AND. IT'S IT'S NOT SO THAT CAN HAPPEN IN THE DEAD OF NIGHT WILL NEED TO BE A LOT OF SCRUTINY. I. AND IT DOES FIT WITHIN THAT GENERAL NATIONAL CONVERSATION HOW DO WE KEEP THE BURDEN OF A FAILED COMPANY FALLING ON THE INDIVIDUAL. SO I THINK A BRING FORWARD I. SECOND THE MOTION. ALRIGHT THANK YOU MISTER COOLEY OF. MISTER CHU. AND THEN MISTER MAYES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I ALSO WANT TO. THANK A MISTER CALDERON WILL BRING THIS BILL. OF FOUR AND GO ALSO SAYING CITY. KISER AND LENA FOR. A REACHING OUT TO MY OFFICE. AND THE DATE YOU DIDN'T REGISTER AS SU A POSITION BUT YOU'LL BRING IN SOME CONCERN. OF. BUT I HEARD YOU KNOW PROMISED HER CALDERON. DEBT HE'S VERY COMMITTED TO OF WORKING FOR SOLUTION. AND JUST LOOKING AT OTHER LANGUAGE HEALTH THIS BILL I WILL BE SUPPORTING AGO TO SPELL. ALRIGHT AND. MISTER MAYES. I JUST OF A QUESTION MAYBE TO IN AND OUT QUICK COMMENT SO THAT THIS IS FOR A COURSE FROM REPUBLICAN MEMBERS OF THIS A COMMITTEE BECAUSE THERE'S SOME LANGUAGE AS A SPECIMEN IN REGARDS TO USING THE WORD TAX OF THAT WE DON'T LIKE SO I JUST WANT CLARIFICATION. THE OPPOSITION WHAT WE WOULD BE VOTING ON TODAY THERE IS NO. TAX INCREASE THAT IN THE CURRENT LANGUAGE SECRETARY ALBRIGHT WITH THAT WITH THAT THAT'S CORRECT MISTER MAYES THAT THE QUESTION AND INTO THE AUTHOR'S POINT ABOUT IF IT'S PUT IN ON THE SENATE SIDE AND COMES BACK HERE AS A TAX. THAT IS WHAT YOU WOULD BE VOTING ON AT THAT POINT WITH NO OPPORTUNITY TO CHANGE IT AS YOU KNOW IN A BILL COMES BACK ON CONCURRENCE IT'S AN UPPER DOWN VOTE CAN AMEND ON CONCURRENCE. SO THEN THIS COMMITTEE AND POSSIBLY THE ASSEMBLY HEALTH COMMITTEE WOULD BE IN A POSITION OF AN UPPER DOWN VOTE ON ATTACKS AS WELL AS AN UPPER DOWN VOTE ON THE GOOD LANGUAGE THAT'S IN THE BILL. RIGHT NOW SO I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND YES IT WOULD COME BACK. BUT YOU MIGHT BE IN IN A BIT OF A DIFFICULT SITUATION THAT WE APPRECIATE HEARING THE AUTHORS COMMITMENT TODAY THAT. HE WILL WORK TOWARD CONSENSUS ON THE SENATE SIDE. THAT WE HAPPY THAT WE'RE HAPPY TO BE IN THOSE CONVERSATIONS BUT I I DO WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR AGAIN KAISER PERMANENTE CANNOT BE OKAY WITH ATTACKS ON HEALTH CARE SERVICE PLAN ENROLLEES. TO HELP PAY FOR LONG TERM CARE INSURANCE INSOLVENCY SO I I WANNA MAKE SURE THAT'S CLEAR THERE ARE OTHER WAYS TO SKIN THIS CAT WE ACTUALLY PROVIDED SEVERAL IDEAS SO WE'RE HAPPY TO CONTINUE THOSE CONVERSATIONS BUT I DON'T WANT THERE TO BE ANY MISUNDERSTANDING ABOUT. WHERE WE CAN WELL I UNDERSTAND THAT BUT YOU AGREE THAT THAT LANGUAGE DOES NOT DO WHAT WE'RE VOTING THAT TODAY ACTUALLY SAW? MISTER CALDERON. NOT ARE SAYING NO THAT'S NOT TRUE SOME LITTLE BIT OF IT IN REGARDS TO PROCESS ON THIS BECAUSE I THINK FOR THIS A COMMITTEE. I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY DISAGREEMENT EFFECT I AGREE WITH ALL OF MY COLLEAGUES COMMENTS ABOUT OF THE NEED A TO BUILD A MOVE SOME SORT OF POLICY AFFORD I THINK IT'S ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY. AT THAT WE HAVE A LONG TERM CARE HEALTHY MARKETPLACE. I'M THINKING TO MYSELF. ABOUT TO TURN FORTY ONE. AND IS A FORMER FINANCIAL ADVISER I SHOULD HAVE BOUGHT THAT THAT TWENTY THREE. I SHOULD HAVE BOUGHT. THAT LONG TERM CARE POLICY WHEN I WAS TWENTY THREE AND I DON'T HAVE ONE NOW AT FORTY ONE. AND SO I SHOULD PROBABLY GO OUT GO TO GO DO THAT BECAUSE. IT'S IT'S NECESSARY I'M FOR THE PUBLIC GOOD THAT YOU WAITED I THOUGHT ABOUT IT A BILL COULD HAVE BEEN YEAH THRUST THE HEIGHT BICU THAT MIGHT BE. THERE MIGHT BE BUT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'VE GOT A HEALTHY YOU A HEALTHY MARKETPLACE. AND WHAT WE REALIZED IS THAT SOME OF THOSE GASES. WAY BACK WHEN AND WHERE WERE WERE INCORRECT. AND WE WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT AS WE GO FORWARD THAT THERE'S A GUARANTEE THAT IF YOU'VE BEEN PAYING PREMIUMS FOR TWENTY THIRTY YEARS OF FORTY YEARS. THAT THERE'S GOING THERE'S GOING TO BE A PRODUCT FOR YOU TO BE ABLE TO DRAW DOWN FROM I'M WHEN YOU GET TO TO RETIREMENT TO THE. THAT NEEDS TO BE FIXED. WE ALSO NEED TO BUILD A RESERVE THE RIGHT TO BE ABLE TO TO CONTINUE TO ENGAGE IN THIS PROCESS AND WHILE THE AUTHOR. HAS A IT IS WORKING WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS THE REST OF US THAT ARE ON THIS COMMITTEE NEED TO CONTINUE TO BEAT TO BE WORKING AS WELL. IF IT DOES END UP. AS A AS AN INCREASE THAT DOESN'T HAVE A NEXUS AND THEN IT'S GONNA BE TWO THIRDS WHICH MEANS THAT BOMB THAT IT'S GONNA HAVE. TO HAVE TO TAKE BROAD CONSENSUS THAT TO BE ABLE TO TO MOVE THAT AND SO EVEN THOUGH IT'S GOING TO BE ON THE SENATE SIDE. WE'RE STILL GONNA GET TO BE ENGAGING IN IN THAT PROCESS BECAUSE IF NOT IT WORK WHERE NO ONE IS NOT GONNA MOVE SO. I'M. WHERE I MET TODAY'S? I THINK THE POLICIES NECESSARY I'M GONNA VOTE IN FAVOR OF IT TENDED TO BE ABLE TO MOVE BUT OF COURSE RESERVE THE RIGHT. TO BE ABLE TO ENGAGE IN THE IN THE POLICY MAKING PROCESS AS WE MOVE FORWARD. AND IT'S A MAYES JUST TO BE CLEAR I'M NOT WILLING TO SACRIFICE WHAT I HAVE IN THIS BILL. ON SOMETHING THAT IS ONE HUNDRED PERCENT A LONG SHOT IF IT DOES COME BACK IN AGAIN. I HAVE ALL OF YOU ARE VERY KEENLY AWARE. MAKE THE MOTIONS ON THE FLOOR TO SEND BILLS BACKED RULES TO SEND BILLS BACK TO COMMITTEE. I WOULD HAVE TO BANK DEAL I WOULD BE THE ONE MAKING THE MOTION TO SEND MY BILL NOT JUST BACK TO THIS COMMITTEE BECAUSE I KNOW THAT THIS COMMITTEE WOULD CALL BACK TO RELITIGATE. THE DID THE CONTENTS BUT ALSO TO THE HEALTH COMMITTEE SO IT WOULD GO BACK TO COMMITTEE. EVEN IF IT WENT OVER THE SENATE IT HAVE TO COME BACK AND GO BACK TO COMMITTEE IS LIKE A BILL. THAT GOT PULLED INTO THE SENATE JUDICIARY THREE DIFFERENT TIMES AFTER BEING ON THE SENATE FLOOR AND THEN CAME BACK AND HAD TO GO BACK TO OURS. ASSEMBLY JUDICIARY COMMITTEE BUT I STILL END UP GETTING TO THE FLOOR. AND IN GETTING IT OUT SO. IN TERMS OF PROCESS THAT'S THAT'S THE ANSWER AND AGAIN I'M NOT WILLING TO SACRIFICE WHAT I DO HAVE THIS BILL BECAUSE THESE ARE IMPORTANT. PIECES ARE TO TAKE ON SOMETHING THAT. WOULD REQUIRE TAX WOULD REQUIRE TWO THIRDS VOTE AND WOULD NOT BE GUARANTEE BECAUSE I'M NOT GONNA SACRIFICE ALL THING. AND YOU DO AND WE HEARD THIS BEFORE HIS TO SAY GET YOUR TO CONTINUE WORK WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS IN MOVE THROUGH THE PROCESS GET.
