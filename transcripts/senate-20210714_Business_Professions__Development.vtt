01:13:29.071 --> 01:13:31.707
REASON WE REGULATE. ONE

01:13:31.774 --> 01:13:32.875
PARTICULAR SECTION OF THE

01:13:32.941 --> 01:13:35.077
INDUSTRY OR OCCUPATION THIS

01:13:35.144 --> 01:13:37.546
PARTICULAR CASES. WE REGULATE

01:13:37.613 --> 01:13:39.648
THOSE WHO MOVE THE HOUSEHOLD

01:13:39.715 --> 01:13:40.949
GOODS OF RESIDENTS OF THE

01:13:41.016 --> 01:13:43.852
STATE. AND THE PURPOSE I ASSUME

01:13:43.919 --> 01:13:45.387
IS TO ENSURE THAT THOSE

01:13:45.454 --> 01:13:45.954
HOUSEHOLD GOODS ARE

01:13:46.021 --> 01:13:47.823
SAFEGUARDED. BUT DURING THE

01:13:47.890 --> 01:13:49.391
PROCESS FROM WITHOUT REGARD TO

01:13:49.458 --> 01:13:51.160
WHO ACTUALLY PACKS THE BOXES

01:13:51.226 --> 01:13:53.162
WHO ACTUALLY TAKES THE BOXES.

01:13:53.228 --> 01:13:54.630
AND PUTS THEM IN THIS CASE IN

01:13:54.696 --> 01:13:57.699
THE PODS. SO I BELIEVE I SHARE

01:13:57.766 --> 01:14:00.269
THE CONCERNS EXPRESSED BY

01:14:00.335 --> 01:14:01.737
SENATOR EGGMAN. ABOUT THIS

01:14:01.804 --> 01:14:04.239
MEASURE- AND I COMPLETELY AGREE

01:14:04.306 --> 01:14:05.407
WITH MY CUT COME IN THE

WHO WERE INVOLVED IN THIS

01:14:11.613 --> 01:14:14.082
PROCESS. BUT I SUPPOSE THE SAME

01:14:14.149 --> 01:14:15.951
COMMENTS COULD BE MADE WITH

01:14:16.018 --> 01:14:17.820

THE HOUSEHOLD GOODS MOVING

01:14:19.288 --> 01:14:20.722
INDUSTRY AND THEN THE QUESTION

01:14:20.789 --> 01:14:22.591
IS WHY REGULATE. A SECTION OF

01:14:22.658 --> 01:14:25.794
IT AND THEN. ON NOT ANOTHER

01:14:25.861 --> 01:14:28.463

01:14:37.773 --> 01:14:39.107
IF WE MOVE THIS BILL FORWARD IF

01:14:39.174 --> 01:14:40.242
THIS BILL MOVES OUT OF THE

01:14:40.309 --> 01:14:41.376
COMMITTEE WE SHOULD CONTINUE TO

ADDRESS THOSE CONCERNS OR NOT

01:47:02.315 --> 01:47:04.417

THAT WHAT I JUST ORDERED WAS

01:53:46.152 --> 01:53:47.487
ACTUALLY WHAT THE RESTAURANT IS

01:53:47.554 --> 01:53:48.488
CHARGING SO THEY COULD CHARGE

01:53:48.555 --> 01:53:50.523
MORE FOR A MENU ITEM THAT IS

01:53:50.590 --> 01:53:51.624
OUT ON DELIVERY BECAUSE THEY'RE

01:53:51.691 --> 01:53:53.326
PAYING MORE BUT THE RESTAURANT

01:53:53.393 --> 01:53:55.562
SETTING THAT. BECAUSE RIGHT NOW

SOME OF THE APPS HAVE A CHARGE

01:53:57.664 --> 01:54:00.400
ON ON ACTUAL ITEMS THEY KNOW

01:54:00.466 --> 01:54:01.501
THAT THE EVERYBODY WILL KNOW

01:54:01.568 --> 01:54:04.003
NOW THIS THIS IS A GRATUITY IT

01:54:04.070 --> 01:54:05.872

OBLIGATION OF THEM BEING PAID

01:54:12.312 --> 01:54:13.813
WE JUST THINK YOU KNOW THIS IS

01:54:13.880 --> 01:54:16.316

01:54:16.382 --> 01:54:17.750
UNFORTUNATELY THESE COMPANIES

01:54:19.652 --> 01:54:21.621

CONSUMERS AND WE JUST THINK

01:54:29.229 --> 01:54:30.196
THAT THE TRANSPARENCY WILL

01:54:30.263 --> 01:54:31.798
ALLOW PEOPLE TO FEEL

01:54:31.864 --> 01:54:35.034

AND I JUST WANNA POINT OUT WHY

01:59:19.685 --> 01:59:21.187
THIS BILL IS NECESSARY FOR THE

CONSUMER AND THE RESTAURANT

01:59:22.555 --> 01:59:24.090
FROM THE CONSUMER PERSPECTIVE

IF YOU WERE TO GO ON A LISTING

RESTAURANT YOUR FAVORITE

01:59:34.267 --> 01:59:35.468
RESTAURANT BUT THAT'S NOT THE

01:59:35.535 --> 01:59:36.802
CASE OF THE PRACTICE THAT WE

01:59:36.869 --> 01:59:38.604
ARE TRYING TO LEGISLATE. IN

01:59:38.671 --> 01:59:40.339

WHICH HAS A NEUTRAL POSITION AS

01:59:41.707 --> 01:59:43.075
BILL ACTUALLY ENDED THE

01:59:43.142 --> 01:59:44.210
PRACTICE OF CALL FORWARDING

01:59:44.277 --> 01:59:45.778
BECAUSE THEY DID NOT WANT TO BE

01:59:45.845 --> 01:59:47.547
SO SHE WITH THIS ANYMORE AND I

01:59:47.613 --> 01:59:48.648
WANT TO LET YOU KNOW THAT WHY

01:59:48.714 --> 01:59:50.349
THE DISCLOSURES ARE SO

01:59:50.416 --> 01:59:52.985
IMPORTANT TO. IS THAT- THIS IS

01:59:53.052 --> 01:59:55.855

01:59:58.391 --> 02:00:00.493
CONTRACT AT A RESTAURANT ENTERS

02:00:00.560 --> 02:00:02.194
AND IT EVEN AS ON WORKS IN MUCH

02:00:02.261 --> 02:00:03.996
THE POLICY IS VERY CONFUSING

02:00:04.063 --> 02:00:06.098
AND- DOES NOT TALK ABOUT THE

02:00:06.165 --> 02:00:07.033
PROJECT ACTS OF CALL

02:00:07.099 --> 02:00:08.868

IT'S REALLY REALLY DIFFICULT.

02:00:19.178 --> 02:00:20.313
THIS IS WHY IT'S NECESSARY TO

02:00:21.480 --> 02:00:27.553

WOULD LIKE TO KNOW THAT IF THEY

02:12:39.017 --> 02:12:40.919

02:12:51.630 --> 02:12:52.964
PERCEPTIONS OF WHAT I THINK

02:12:53.031 --> 02:12:54.333
IT'S GOING BUT IT'S NOT GOING

02:12:54.399 --> 02:12:56.835

CHAIRMAN- I HAVE A COUPLE OF

02:16:47.899 --> 02:16:51.202
QUESTIONS SO WHAT YOU DO YOU

02:16:51.269 --> 02:16:53.772
TALKED ABOUT- SPACE A CUSTOMER

02:16:53.838 --> 02:16:56.575
CALLS AND ASKS WHAT TIME DO YOU

02:16:56.641 --> 02:16:58.443
CLOSE TODAY AND THEY HNG UP

02:16:58.510 --> 02:16:59.878
AND THEN A RESTAURANT COULD BE

02:16:59.945 --> 02:17:02.614
CHARGED FOR THAT CALL SO. I

02:17:02.681 --> 02:17:03.982
GUESS I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND

02:17:04.049 --> 02:17:06.251
THE LOGISTICS OF THIS HOW DOES

02:17:06.318 --> 02:17:07.719
A RESTAURANT OWNER IF THEY ARE

02:17:07.786 --> 02:17:09.721
GOING TO GO THROUGH THE CALLS

02:17:09.788 --> 02:17:11.389
AND THE CHARGES HOW WOULD THEY

02:17:11.456 --> 02:17:13.725
KNOW THAT A CALL. THAT SOMEONE

02:17:13.792 --> 02:17:15.126
CALLED IN AND ONLY ASKED WHAT

02:17:15.193 --> 02:17:17.529
TIME THEY CLOSE AS OPPOSED TO

02:17:17.596 --> 02:17:18.129
SOMEBODY CALLED IN AND PLACED

02:17:18.196 --> 02:17:19.764
AN ORDER. IT'S A GREAT QUESTION

02:17:19.831 --> 02:17:20.899
I DON'T KNOW IF MY WITNESS

02:17:20.966 --> 02:17:22.500
RECESS STILL ON OR ANY OF MY

02:17:22.567 --> 02:17:23.234
WITNESSES IF THEY WANT

02:17:23.301 --> 02:17:24.603
EXPLAINED ON. THE LIKE DID A

02:17:24.669 --> 02:17:25.937
LOGISTICAL PART I WOULDN'T KNOW

02:17:26.004 --> 02:17:27.372
AS NOT A RESTAURANT OWNER BUT I

02:17:27.439 --> 02:17:28.340
DON'T KNOW IF THEY'RE STILL ON

02:17:28.406 --> 02:17:29.240
BECAUSE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT

02:17:29.307 --> 02:17:30.775
TO BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND HOW. A

02:17:30.842 --> 02:17:32.677
RESTAURANT OWNER COULD DISCERN

02:17:32.744 --> 02:17:34.112
BETWEEN A CALL THEY SHOULD E

02:17:34.179 --> 02:17:35.447
CHARGED FOR IN A CALL THAT

02:17:35.513 --> 02:17:36.848
PERHAPS THEY SHOULD NOT RIGHT

02:17:36.915 --> 02:17:38.316
AND I MEAN JUST TO PRACTICE IF

02:17:38.383 --> 02:17:39.417
THEY SAY YEAH THAT'S THE

02:17:39.484 --> 02:17:40.852
FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM IS MOST THE

02:17:40.919 --> 02:17:41.553
TIME IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO

02:17:41.620 --> 02:17:43.154
DISCERN- I DON'T KNOW IF

02:17:43.221 --> 02:17:45.290
THEY'RE- STILL ON. WELL MY I

02:17:45.357 --> 02:17:46.491
GUESS MA'AM PERHAPS WHILE WE

02:17:46.558 --> 02:17:49.361
WAIT FOR HER IF SHE'S GOING TO

02:17:49.427 --> 02:17:50.996
COME BACK ON THE LINE- I READ

02:17:51.062 --> 02:17:54.532
THROUGH THE CONTRACT. AND I

02:17:54.599 --> 02:17:56.268
THINK THERE'S A SUGGESTION THAT
