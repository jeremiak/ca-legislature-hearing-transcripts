OF THIS CURVE NOT BEHIND IT-

00:33:17.228 --> 00:33:18.730
ONE THING THAT I'VE ALWAYS

00:33:18.796 --> 00:33:20.665
RESPECTED THE MOST ABOUT THE

00:33:20.732 --> 00:33:21.866

TO BE ASKING QUESTIONS TO GET A

00:33:36.247 --> 00:33:37.849
BETTER IDEA OF WHAT THE SCOPE.

00:33:37.915 --> 00:33:39.784

APPROPRIATED BUT NOW THE

00:33:49.026 --> 00:33:50.962
UNDERSTANDING IS THERE COULD BE

00:33:51.028 --> 00:33:52.363
SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS THAT WILL

00:33:52.430 --> 00:33:54.665

NEEDS TO BE DONE FOR SURE AND

00:40:12.343 --> 00:40:13.978
THIS POPULATION WHICH WILL

00:40:14.044 --> 00:40:16.046

FOOD SUPPORT IS ANOTHER ISSUE

00:40:22.586 --> 00:40:25.089
OF GRAVE CONCERN. DEMANDS ON

00:40:25.156 --> 00:40:27.258
OUR FOOD BANKS ARE ESCALATING

00:40:27.324 --> 00:40:28.959
WITH EVERY PASSING DAY

00:40:29.026 --> 00:40:31.428

00:40:43.507 --> 00:40:46.043
PANDEMIC AND MARSHALL

00:40:46.110 --> 00:40:48.145
MARSHALLING RESOURCES FOR THEM.

SECONDLY WHILE ONLY EVER

00:41:01.458 --> 00:41:03.894
SUGGESTS THAT CALIFORNIA MAY

00:41:03.961 --> 00:41:05.596
ESCAPE THE EMERGENCY ROOM

00:41:05.663 --> 00:41:07.698
CRISES THAT WE ARE SEEING IN

00:41:07.765 --> 00:41:10.467
NEW YORK ITALY AND ELSEWHERE.

00:41:10.534 --> 00:41:12.570
THE EPICENTER OF CALIFORNIA'S

00:41:12.636 --> 00:41:15.706
CRISES SEEMS TO BE UNFOLDING

00:41:15.773 --> 00:41:17.274
WITHIN OUR NURSING HOMES. THE

00:41:17.341 --> 00:41:19.476
LIVES OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE

00:41:19.543 --> 00:41:21.378

HANDS OF A WORK FORCE THAT IS

00:41:23.547 --> 00:41:27.017
INSUFFICIENT AT SIZE IN SIZE

00:41:27.084 --> 00:41:30.387
EVEN IN THE BEST OF TIMES.

00:41:30.454 --> 00:41:32.489
BEYOND TO NURSING HOMES ARE

00:41:32.556 --> 00:41:34.925
HEALTH CARE WORK FORCE OVERALL

00:41:34.992 --> 00:41:36.927
WAS RECOGNIZED TO BE WOEFULLY

00:41:36.994 --> 00:41:39.263
INADEQUATE PRIOR TO THIS

00:41:39.330 --> 00:41:42.233
PANDEMIC. NOW WE ARE WATCHING

00:41:42.299 --> 00:41:44.602
THAT THIS WORK FORCE IN KING

00:41:44.668 --> 00:41:46.370

00:42:15.966 --> 00:42:17.601
AMONG OTHER STRATEGIES

00:42:17.668 --> 00:42:19.904
TELEHEALTH IS NOT A TEMPORARY

00:42:19.970 --> 00:42:23.240
SOLUTION IT IS OUR NEW NORMAL

00:42:23.307 --> 00:42:25.009
AND THEREFORE IT MUST BE

00:42:25.075 --> 00:42:28.212

00:42:48.899 --> 00:42:51.035
PERFECT RECIPE FOR NEW

COMPASSION TO VULNERABLE

00:43:20.898 --> 00:43:23.067
COMMUNITIES AND TO FIGHT FOR

I WALK YOU THROUGH. OUR

00:48:18.428 --> 00:48:20.464
MODELING EFFORTS I WANT TO

00:48:20.530 --> 00:48:23.133
PRACTICE AND MIGHT REMARKS WITH

00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:24.968
THREE DISTINCT. PIECES OF

00:48:25.035 --> 00:48:26.069
INFORMATION THAT I THINK WILL

00:48:26.136 --> 00:48:27.137
PROVIDE YOU WITH A LITTLE BIT

00:48:27.204 --> 00:48:28.605
OF CONTEXT AS TO HOW WE ARE

00:48:28.672 --> 00:48:31.608
USING. OF MODELING AND DATA TO

00:48:31.675 --> 00:48:34.044
INFORM OUR DECISION MAKING HERE

00:48:34.111 --> 00:48:35.512
AT THE STATE OPERATIONS CENTER.

00:48:35.579 --> 00:48:36.813
FIRST I THINK IT'S REALLY

00:48:36.880 --> 00:48:38.181
IMPORTANT AND UNDER I

00:48:38.248 --> 00:48:40.117
UNDERSTAND THAT ALL MODELS

00:48:40.183 --> 00:48:41.385
INCLUDING THE MODEL THAT WE ARE

00:48:41.451 --> 00:48:44.554
USING. HAVE A HIGH. HIGH SENSE

00:48:44.621 --> 00:48:47.257
OF UNCERTAINTY. AND PART OF

00:48:47.324 --> 00:48:48.492
THAT IS BECAUSE THE SIGNS THE

00:48:48.558 --> 00:48:50.927
EVIDENCE BASE. FOR THE BASIC

00:48:50.994 --> 00:48:52.729
ASSUMPTIONS THAT WE'RE USING IN

00:48:52.796 --> 00:48:54.765
THESE MODELS. IS NOT ONLY THE

00:48:54.831 --> 00:48:57.334
FACT THAT THE EVIDENCE BASE AND

00:48:57.401 --> 00:48:58.035
THE SCIENCE IS BEING BUILT

00:48:58.101 --> 00:48:59.670
EVERYTHING HEY. SO IT'S

00:48:59.736 --> 00:49:01.505
IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND THAT THERE

00:49:01.571 --> 00:49:04.474
IS A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY THIS

00:49:04.541 --> 00:49:06.710
BOTTLE AND ALL MODELS BECAUSE

00:49:06.777 --> 00:49:08.812
OF THE BASIC ASSUMPTIONS. BEING

00:49:08.879 --> 00:49:10.614
MADE AT. THIS POINT THAT I. IS

00:49:10.681 --> 00:49:14.484
THAT. THERE ARE BOTH OF BOTTLES.

00:49:14.551 --> 00:49:15.485
AVAILABLE AND THERE IS A OF NO

00:49:15.552 --> 00:49:18.588
WITH REGARDS THE MILE. AND I

00:49:18.655 --> 00:49:20.324
THINK MODELING. HELP SAID LOOK

00:49:20.390 --> 00:49:22.626
AT RATIONALITY BUT I THINK DOES

00:49:22.693 --> 00:49:26.330
NOT GIVE A- CERTAIN FACTS OF

00:49:26.396 --> 00:49:28.832
WHAT. HAPPENED ON THE GROUND

00:49:28.899 --> 00:49:30.033
AND SO IT'S- IMPORTANT AS YOU

00:49:30.100 --> 00:49:33.603
LOOK AT BOTH THE BOTTLE AND ALL

00:49:33.670 --> 00:49:35.005
AUTO CENTER. PRESENT ACROSS

00:49:35.072 --> 00:49:36.440
STATE THAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT

00:49:36.506 --> 00:49:38.775
OUT. OPENLY IN THE SENSE THAT

00:49:38.842 --> 00:49:41.244
IT REALLY DOESN'T. ALL OF OUR

00:49:41.311 --> 00:49:42.713
BUT IT HELP UNDER THE JACK

00:49:42.779 --> 00:49:50.320
CORRECT NOT. THE THIRD POINT

00:49:50.387 --> 00:49:52.456
THAT I MAKE IT. DATA IS MOST

00:49:52.522 --> 00:49:54.124
AND- DATA IN THIS CAR. OR WE

00:49:54.191 --> 00:49:55.759
AGO WHEN WE- WITHIN THE OPERATE

00:49:55.826 --> 00:49:57.027
OR AT LEAST A TERMS OF. AROUND

00:49:57.094 --> 00:49:58.862
THE- WE DID NOT HAVE AN DAY. WE

00:49:58.929 --> 00:49:59.629
ONLY HAVE SOME PRETTY OF WERE

00:49:59.696 --> 00:50:01.698
WORKING ON THAT DATE WE HAVE

00:50:01.765 --> 00:50:03.800
ACT DATA AND NOT AND- THE

00:50:03.867 --> 00:50:06.103
ACTUAL DATA IS ON. IMPORTANT IN

00:50:06.169 --> 00:50:07.738
HELPING US UNDERSTAND THE

00:50:07.804 --> 00:50:09.306
DIFFERENCES THAT ARE HAPPENING

00:50:09.373 --> 00:50:10.674
WITH IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

00:50:10.741 --> 00:50:12.075
AND ACROSS THE STATE OF

00:50:12.142 --> 00:50:14.044
CALIFORNIA SO THE ACTUAL DATA

00:50:14.111 --> 00:50:15.812
IS ACTUALLY WHAT'S GUIDING OUR

00:50:15.879 --> 00:50:17.748
WORK NOT THE MODELING WORK AND

00:50:17.814 --> 00:50:19.216
I THINK THAT IS A REALLY

00:50:19.282 --> 00:50:20.984
IMPORTANT THING HEY. I'LL CLOSE

00:50:21.051 --> 00:50:22.753
ON THIS SLIDE BY SAYING THAT

00:50:22.819 --> 00:50:24.554
DIRECTOR GO WOULD YOU CHIEF AND

00:50:24.621 --> 00:50:26.456
SENATE WE PLAN FOR THE WORST

00:50:26.523 --> 00:50:28.658
SCENARIO BUT WE ARE HARDEST TO

00:50:28.725 --> 00:50:30.460
COME UP THE BEST CASE SCENARIO

00:50:30.527 --> 00:50:32.295
AND THAT'S REALLY THE EFFORTS.

00:50:32.362 --> 00:50:34.164
WE'VE GOT DONE AT THE STATE

00:50:34.231 --> 00:50:36.099
OPERATIONS CENTER AND I THINK

00:50:36.166 --> 00:50:37.234
THAT'S THE CRIME BEYOND

00:50:37.300 --> 00:50:39.469
MODELING. SO THEY REALLY ARE

00:50:39.536 --> 00:50:41.738
LOOKING AT SOME OF THE WORST

00:50:41.805 --> 00:50:45.609
CASE SCENARIOS BUT WE WORK.

00:50:45.675 --> 00:50:50.514
REALLY RESCUE. SO WE CAN GO.

00:50:50.580 --> 00:50:52.816
WHAT YOU WILL SEE IS A SCENARIO

00:50:52.883 --> 00:50:54.584
WITHOUT IN ANY INTERVENTION.

00:50:54.651 --> 00:50:56.620
THIS IS IF WE IF THE GOVERNOR

00:50:56.686 --> 00:50:58.422
HAD NOT PUT A STAY AT HOME

00:50:58.488 --> 00:51:00.657
ORDER IN PLACE AND WE NOT DONE

00:51:00.724 --> 00:51:02.225
PHYSICAL DISTANCING THE

00:51:02.292 --> 00:51:04.161
HORIZONTAL LINE THAT YOU SEE

00:51:04.227 --> 00:51:07.364
ABOVE THE X. AXIS IS OUR SEARCH

00:51:07.431 --> 00:51:09.599
CAPACITY AND SEARCH CAPACITY

00:51:09.666 --> 00:51:11.435
WHETHER AN OVERWHELMING TO VERY

00:51:11.501 --> 00:51:15.105
VERY QUICKLY HAD WE NOT PUT THE

00:51:15.172 --> 00:51:15.672
STATE HOME ORDER IN FACT WE

00:51:15.739 --> 00:51:17.507
WOULD HAVE PRINT. MODEL PRINT

00:51:17.574 --> 00:51:20.210
CLOSE TO HUNDRED HOSPITALS. AS

00:51:20.277 --> 00:51:21.912
A RESULT OF THE VIRUS AND NO

00:51:21.978 --> 00:51:23.480
INTERVENTIONS BEING PUT IN

00:51:23.547 --> 00:51:25.148
PLACE THESE INTERVENTIONS ARE

00:51:25.215 --> 00:51:26.883
OFTEN CALLED NON PHARMACEUTICAL

00:51:26.950 --> 00:51:28.518
INTERVENTIONS ARE EMPTY EYES

00:51:28.585 --> 00:51:30.487
AND THEY INCLUDE THINGS SUCH

00:51:30.554 --> 00:51:33.356
AS- CLOSING DOWN MASS

00:51:33.423 --> 00:51:36.726
GATHERINGS I AM PUTTING IN THE

00:51:36.793 --> 00:51:40.664
STATE OR MORE. AND IMPLEMENTING

00:51:40.730 --> 00:51:43.667
PHYSICAL THIS. SO IT JUST SENSE

00:51:43.733 --> 00:51:46.403
OF THE MAC HAD WE DONE ANY.

00:51:46.470 --> 00:51:48.972
NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. THERE WE ARE

00:51:49.039 --> 00:51:53.510
I LOOK AT THE SONORA. WITH THE

00:51:53.577 --> 00:51:55.712
IN THAT WE PUT IN PLACE AND

00:51:55.779 --> 00:51:57.948
WHAT YOU WILL SEE HERE IS A

00:51:58.014 --> 00:52:01.585
BLUE LINE THAT IS THE MEDIAN.

00:52:01.651 --> 00:52:04.120
THE SCENARIOS THAT ARE RAN IN

00:52:04.187 --> 00:52:06.490
THE BOTTLE AND THAT THE CODE

00:52:06.556 --> 00:52:09.292
THAT YOU SEE HERE. IS FROM THE

00:52:09.359 --> 00:52:11.194
TWENTY FIFTH PERCENTILE TO THE

00:52:11.261 --> 00:52:12.729
SEVEN FIFTH PERCENTILE THE RED

00:52:12.796 --> 00:52:15.732
DOTS THAT YOU SEE HERE- OR THE

00:52:15.799 --> 00:52:17.501
RED LINE AT THE BOTTOM IS OUR

00:52:17.567 --> 00:52:19.536
ACTUAL HOSPITALIZATIONS AND

00:52:19.603 --> 00:52:21.605
WHAT I WANT FOLKS TO TAKE AWAY

00:52:21.671 --> 00:52:23.073
FROM THE SCREEN IS THAT OUR

00:52:23.139 --> 00:52:25.509
INTERVENTIONS ARE WORKING

00:52:25.575 --> 00:52:29.312
EXTREMELY WELL. AND WHAT WE

00:52:29.379 --> 00:52:32.115
NEED TO YOU CAN THIS ARE WE TO

GOVERNOR STATE OR- BECAUSE THE

00:52:40.156 --> 00:52:41.525
IMPACT IS EVIDENT IN THE DAY

00:52:41.591 --> 00:52:42.559
THAT WE'RE- SO MOST OF THE

00:52:42.626 --> 00:52:44.361
SPRAY IF. THE ACTUAL IS THE

00:52:44.427 --> 00:52:46.029
RIGHT DOT OR THE RED LINE THAT

00:52:46.096 --> 00:52:47.597
YOU SEE ON THIS PARTICULAR

00:52:47.664 --> 00:52:51.234
GRAPH. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. HERE

00:52:51.301 --> 00:52:53.103
WHAT WE'VE MODEL IS IF WE WERE

00:52:53.169 --> 00:52:54.971
TO LIFT THE INTERVENTIONS AND

00:52:55.038 --> 00:52:56.873
GO BACK TO NORMAL WHAT WE WOULD

00:52:56.940 --> 00:52:58.608
SEE IN TERMS OF THE SPY SO THE

00:52:58.675 --> 00:53:00.610
INITIAL DOTTED LINE WHICH IS

00:53:00.677 --> 00:53:03.013
LIGHTLY GREAT IS WHAT WE WOULD

00:53:03.079 --> 00:53:03.980
HAVE SEEN HAD WE NOT DONE

00:53:04.047 --> 00:53:07.050
ANYTHING THAT I HAD THE BLUE

00:53:07.117 --> 00:53:09.553
AYE SOLID LINE IS THE MEDIAN

00:53:09.619 --> 00:53:11.154
WITH REGARDS TO THE MODEL THE

00:53:11.221 --> 00:53:13.757
RED LINE IS THE ACTUAL

00:53:13.823 --> 00:53:16.960
HOSPITALIZATIONS. IF I WERE TO

00:53:17.027 --> 00:53:18.028
LEFT THAT THAT IN NON

00:53:18.094 --> 00:53:19.863
PHARMACEUTICAL ENGINES YOU

00:53:19.930 --> 00:53:21.865
WOULD SEE A SPIKE SO WHEN YOU

00:53:21.932 --> 00:53:24.367
LOOK AT OTHER COUNTRIES LIKE

00:53:24.434 --> 00:53:26.937
SOUTH KOREA INJURED AND THEY

00:53:27.003 --> 00:53:28.838
LIFTED THEIR EMPTY EYES AND NOW

00:53:28.905 --> 00:53:30.173
WE'RE HAVING TO PUT THEM BACK

00:53:30.240 --> 00:53:35.145
IN PLACE. EIGHTEEN EIGHTEEN FLU

00:53:35.211 --> 00:53:37.013
PANDEMIC GIVE US SOME GOOD

00:53:37.080 --> 00:53:39.082
INSIGHTS INTO TERMS OF HOW TO

00:53:39.149 --> 00:53:40.984
PREPARE FOR LIFTING EMPTY EYES

00:53:41.051 --> 00:53:42.886
AND IN FACT A NUMBER OF CITIES

00:53:42.953 --> 00:53:45.021
IN THE UNITED STATES LIFTED

00:53:45.088 --> 00:53:47.023
THEIR EMPTY ICE TOO QUICKLY AND

00:53:47.090 --> 00:53:49.092
SAW SIGNIFICANT BY EARLY THIS

00:53:49.159 --> 00:53:51.595
WEEK THE GOVERNOR LAID OUT SIX

WILL BE USING TO GUIDE OUR

00:53:55.131 --> 00:53:57.867
DECISION MAKING AROUND HOW WE

00:53:57.934 --> 00:54:00.370
LEFT OR MODIFIED. GUYS MOVING

THE HELP IT IS A CAN. WELL

01:33:46.320 --> 01:33:49.890
CENTER CAN PREVENT. BUT WHAT.

DISEASE PREVENTION IN LOOKING

01:33:52.994 --> 01:33:54.562
AT WHAT THE UNMITIGATED ARE NOT

01:33:54.628 --> 01:33:56.664
VALUE LOOKS LIKE IN TERMS OF

01:33:56.731 --> 01:33:58.532
THE HOSPITAL. WE'RE LOOKING AT

01:33:58.599 --> 01:34:01.502
IT PERCENT STATION RATE WITHIN

01:34:01.569 --> 01:34:02.903
THIS PARTICULAR MODEL WE ARE

01:34:02.970 --> 01:34:05.539
ALSO LOOK AT A 32% CLOSE THIS

01:34:05.606 --> 01:34:08.843
OF VETERANS WERE HOT. IN THE

01:34:08.909 --> 01:34:10.578
SEE YOU SO THE ARE KIND OF

01:34:10.644 --> 01:34:11.746
UNDER S. THAT FEED INTO THIS

PARTICULAR MODEL HAVE. YOU

01:34:14.749 --> 01:34:18.085
MIGHT HAVE SO ONE ONE OF. A

01:34:18.152 --> 01:34:18.686
FOLLOW UP TO THAT TO THAT IS

01:34:18.753 --> 01:34:20.721
THAT CERTAINLY THE MODELING AND

01:34:20.788 --> 01:34:22.023
THE ASSUMPTIONS ARE BASED ON

01:34:22.089 --> 01:34:23.357
THE TESTING LEVELS AND EACH

01:34:23.424 --> 01:34:25.826
EACH CAT IS HAS. A CERTAIN

01:34:25.893 --> 01:34:27.595
PROTESTING CAPACITY- CORRECT

01:34:27.661 --> 01:34:28.696
YES TO MORE THAN OTHER

01:34:28.763 --> 01:34:30.831
COUNTIES- IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY

01:34:30.898 --> 01:34:31.866
LA IN THE BAY AREA CERTAINLY

01:34:31.932 --> 01:34:33.934
OUR TESTING. DUE TO THE LA

01:34:34.001 --> 01:34:36.337
ABRASIVE EXISTED DOES THE

01:34:36.404 --> 01:34:38.806
MODELING THAT YOU CURRENTLY

01:34:38.873 --> 01:34:43.544
USED THE JOB AT. AT THE MODEL

01:34:43.611 --> 01:34:46.247
NOT A ANY THE MODELS ARE NOT

01:34:46.313 --> 01:34:48.182
BAKED IN TESTING WHAT WHAT

01:34:48.249 --> 01:34:50.384
REALLY- THE ACTUAL DATA THAT

01:34:50.451 --> 01:34:51.285
WE'RE GETTING CERTAINLY IS

01:34:51.352 --> 01:34:53.554
BASED ON TESTING BECAUSE THAT

01:34:53.621 --> 01:34:55.556
SOMEBODY HAS TO BE TASK IN

01:34:55.623 --> 01:34:57.058
ORDER TO CONFIRM POSITIVE BUT

01:34:57.124 --> 01:34:59.627
THE ACTION THAT WERE THAT

01:34:59.693 --> 01:35:00.961
FUNCTION OF TESTING TO SOME

01:35:01.028 --> 01:35:04.398
EXTENT- BUT THE ACTUAL MY OF

01:35:04.465 --> 01:35:06.734
DATA THAT'S COMING OUT OF THE

01:35:06.801 --> 01:35:09.470
MODEL. NOT ADJUSTED TO THE TIME.

01:35:09.537 --> 01:35:10.337
SO THEN IN OF THE INTERACTIONS

01:35:10.404 --> 01:35:11.906
BETWEEN THE DATA AND THAT AND

01:35:11.972 --> 01:35:14.775
THAT AND THE MODELING EVEN A

01:35:14.842 --> 01:35:16.210
QUE THEY CLEARLY WERE MAKING

01:35:16.277 --> 01:35:18.279
DECISIONS ON REAL TIME DATA SO

01:35:18.345 --> 01:35:21.715
HOSPITALS UP AS AT LEAST THE

01:35:21.782 --> 01:35:22.783
ONES THAT I'M FAMILIAR WITH AND

01:35:22.850 --> 01:35:25.786
KERN COUNTY THAT THEIR- THEY-

01:35:25.853 --> 01:35:29.123
SO HOW. YOU ADJUSTING THEN FOR

01:35:29.190 --> 01:35:30.658
A HOW DO YOU AND HOW ARE YOU

01:35:30.724 --> 01:35:34.295
FACTORING IN THOSE TYPES OF-

01:35:34.361 --> 01:35:37.131
DATA. TO IS TO ALLOW. THE

01:35:37.198 --> 01:35:39.233
DOUBLE HOSPITALS TO RE OPEN AND

01:35:39.300 --> 01:35:42.002
A LOT AND DO DO SURGERIES ARE

01:35:42.069 --> 01:35:46.006
YOU IS THAT PART OF THE GEN IN

01:35:46.073 --> 01:35:47.975
TERMS OF WELL AS WE JUST MOVING.

01:35:48.042 --> 01:35:52.179
YEAH THAT'S QUESTION DOWN A

01:35:52.246 --> 01:35:53.080

HOSPITAL LEVEL CARE TO OTHER

01:36:02.456 --> 01:36:03.924
STRINGS- AND THEN MORE

01:36:03.991 --> 01:36:05.860
IMPORTANTLY THEY'VE ALSO BUILT

01:36:05.926 --> 01:36:09.163
UP A SURGE CAPACITY AND SO THEY

01:36:09.230 --> 01:36:09.697

HELP IN THINKING REGARDS TO THE

01:36:27.581 --> 01:36:29.783
INDICATORS THAT THE GOVERNOR

01:36:29.850 --> 01:36:33.521
OUTLINED OUT WE CAN BE ABLE ARE

01:36:33.587 --> 01:36:37.491
RIGHT THE DISH INFORMATION ON

01:36:37.558 --> 01:36:39.226
THIS WE- I AROUND HOW DO WE-

01:36:39.293 --> 01:36:39.760
HAVE. TO CERTAIN THINGS IN

01:36:39.827 --> 01:36:42.096
ORDER TO MAKE MY- SUCH AS ARE

01:36:42.163 --> 01:36:43.797
CERTAIN REASON PARTICULAR

01:36:43.864 --> 01:36:45.566
HOSPITAL'S ASSET THAT WILL BE

01:36:45.633 --> 01:36:46.700
PART OF THAT EQUATION THAT REAL

01:36:46.767 --> 01:36:48.302
DATA REALLY HELPS US THINK

01:36:48.369 --> 01:36:50.638
ABOUT WHAT DO WE DO MOVING

01:36:50.704 --> 01:36:52.873
FORWARD AND THE SURGEON ONE OF

01:36:52.940 --> 01:36:55.109
THOSE ASKED. SO I GUESS THE

01:36:55.176 --> 01:36:56.010
FOLLOW UP ON THAT IS THERE

01:36:56.076 --> 01:36:58.145
JUST. ALLOW FOR LACK OF BETTER

01:36:58.212 --> 01:37:00.147
TERM NON HOT SPOT COUNTIES THE

01:37:00.214 --> 01:37:02.650
ABILITY TO FACE AND BACK TO

ESTABLISHED BODY IS THAT A

01:37:15.196 --> 01:37:17.698
POSSIBILITY. SO THAT'S PART OF

01:37:17.765 --> 01:37:18.966
THE EQUATION AND THAT'S PART OF

01:37:19.033 --> 01:37:21.402
OUR THINKING IN REGARDS TO THE

01:37:21.468 --> 01:37:22.236

PER REPORTING BASIS JUST

01:38:23.797 --> 01:38:25.532
BECAUSE AND NOW EVERYTHING IS

SURVIVE- THE DEPEND MAKE JUST

01:40:16.910 --> 01:40:18.612
BECAUSE PATIENTS AREN'T ARE

COMES. EFFORT. OKAY LOCAL. MAPS

02:55:35.725 --> 02:55:37.860
SO THE POSSIBILITY THAT SMALLER

02:55:37.927 --> 02:55:39.495
JURISDICTIONS MIGHT NOT GET

02:55:39.562 --> 02:55:40.396

QUESTIONING IS BECAUSE I'M FACT

03:52:41.847 --> 03:52:42.581

BATTERY SOLAR AND STORAGE

03:52:46.886 --> 03:52:48.854
MANUFACTURING. I WON THIS

03:52:48.921 --> 03:52:51.023
CRISIS BROKE OUT BY THE WAY-

03:52:51.090 --> 03:52:52.825

ROUTED THEIR MANUFACTURING

03:53:00.066 --> 03:53:03.536
RETOOL THAT SO WE COULDPRODUCES MUCH PP FOR HEALTH

THE COUNTRY THEY'RE DOING THE

03:53:09.241 --> 03:53:10.776
SAME THING SO I WOULD JUST

03:53:10.843 --> 03:53:13.979
SUGGEST NEXT TIME WE HAVE A LAW.

03:53:14.046 --> 03:53:14.980

04:39:30.386 --> 04:39:31.788
A BLANK CHECK OR THAT WE WOULD

04:39:31.855 --> 04:39:36.459
JUST BE- JUST- NOTIFIED AFTER

04:39:36.526 --> 04:39:38.428
EXPENDITURES WERE ALREADY

04:39:38.495 --> 04:39:40.363
COMMITTED TO SO I THINK THE

04:39:40.430 --> 04:39:44.300
HOPE IS. NOT WE HAVE GONE

04:39:44.367 --> 04:39:46.703
THROUGH A ROUGH INITIAL FIVE

04:39:46.769 --> 04:39:48.371
WEEKS AND OBVIOUSLY THERE'S

04:39:48.438 --> 04:39:52.809
STILL MORE TO BE. DONE BUT THAT

04:39:52.876 --> 04:39:55.145
WILL BE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE

04:39:55.211 --> 04:39:56.880
DISCUSSION BACK AND FORTH

04:39:56.946 --> 04:39:57.814
ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO

04:39:57.881 --> 04:40:00.850
THE- EXPENDITURE OF RESOURCES

04:40:00.917 --> 04:40:04.120
ESPECIALLY AS IT HAS AN IMPACT-

04:40:04.187 --> 04:40:05.788
GOING INTO NEXT YEAR'S BUDGET

04:40:05.855 --> 04:40:08.691
AS WELL AS- AN ONGOING BUDGETS.

04:40:08.758 --> 04:40:11.161
THIS IS NOT THIS IS A RESERVE

04:40:11.227 --> 04:40:14.397
ANY. OF POLY WE'VE ALL. VERY

04:40:14.464 --> 04:40:18.434
VERY TO BUILD YOU KNOW WE I WAS

04:40:18.501 --> 04:40:19.469
THERE ON THE GROUND FLOOR AS WE

04:40:19.536 --> 04:40:21.037
STARTED BUILDING THIS SERVICE

04:40:21.104 --> 04:40:23.373
AND I THINK WE- WANT TO HAVE A

04:40:23.439 --> 04:40:26.709
SAY IN TO HOW. THIS RESERVE

04:40:26.776 --> 04:40:29.312
MONEY IS BEINGSPENT- WE

04:40:29.379 --> 04:40:31.047
OBVIOUSLY KNOW THAT RIGHT NOW

04:40:31.114 --> 04:40:35.351
WE HAVE A CRISIS- WE HAVE FULL

04:40:35.418 --> 04:40:38.855
FAITH AND- DUTY OF THE GOVERNOR

04:40:38.922 --> 04:40:39.722
TO REALLY GET US THROUGH THIS

04:40:39.789 --> 04:40:41.324
CRIME BUT HOW DOES THAT I THINK

04:40:41.391 --> 04:40:42.759
WE ALSO. FEEL LIKE WE HAVE A

04:40:42.825 --> 04:40:44.194
VERY IMPORTANT ROLE TO PLAY

04:40:44.260 --> 04:40:45.895
ESPECIALLY AS IT COMES TO THE

04:40:45.962 --> 04:40:47.163
APPROPRIATION AND THE

04:40:47.230 --> 04:40:49.999
EXPENDITURE OF THESE RESOURCES

04:40:50.066 --> 04:40:53.803
SO THEN. JUST GOING BACK TO THE

04:40:53.870 --> 04:40:55.638
OTHER FIVE BILLION WIND WIND WE

04:40:55.705 --> 04:40:56.873
ANTICIPATE GETTING MORE

04:40:56.940 --> 04:41:01.911
INFORMATION ON THIS. SO I THINK

04:41:01.978 --> 04:41:05.181
I CAN SAY ARE. YOU EAT EVEN IN

04:41:05.248 --> 04:41:07.050
THE NEXT COUPLE WEEKS I DON'T

04:41:07.116 --> 04:41:08.418
THINK THAT THERE WILL BE A FULL

04:41:08.484 --> 04:41:09.986
PLAN FOR COMMUNICATIONS OF THE

04:41:10.053 --> 04:41:11.254
EXACT FIVE BILLION IN PART

04:41:11.321 --> 04:41:12.655
BECAUSE THAT FIVE BILLION.

04:41:12.722 --> 04:41:14.757
TAKER MAY CHANGE BUT CERTAINLY

04:41:14.824 --> 04:41:16.392
THAT YOU CAN EXPECT THAT AS

04:41:16.459 --> 04:41:17.961
PART OF THE NAME PROVISIONS.

04:41:18.027 --> 04:41:19.095
BUDGET PROCESS YOU KNOW WE'RE

04:41:19.162 --> 04:41:21.097
PRESENTING OUR FISCAL PLAN

04:41:21.164 --> 04:41:22.732
ABOUT PROPOSAL FOR THE UPCOMING

04:41:22.799 --> 04:41:26.636
YEAR FOR YOU OUR CONSIDERATION-

04:41:26.703 --> 04:41:27.170
THERE SHOULD BE ADDITIONAL

04:41:27.237 --> 04:41:32.208
DETAIL THERE. THEY WERE YOUNG I

04:41:32.275 --> 04:41:32.842
THINK THE HOPE. MOVE AWAY FROM

04:41:32.909 --> 04:41:36.846
JOINT. BUDGET NOW. ARE WE

04:41:36.913 --> 04:41:38.314
UNDERSTAND THAT YOU MAY NOT

04:41:38.381 --> 04:41:40.183
KNOW EVERYTHING IN THE FUTURE I

04:41:40.250 --> 04:41:41.918
THINK THE YOU KNOW EVERY YEAR

04:41:41.985 --> 04:41:42.919
WE DO A BUDGET AND THE ONLY

04:41:42.986 --> 04:41:45.088
THING. WE CAN SAY FOR CERTAINTY

04:41:45.154 --> 04:41:46.489
IS THE BY JUST NOT GONNA BE ONE

04:41:46.556 --> 04:41:47.857
UNDER PERCENT AFTER WE ALL WE

04:41:47.924 --> 04:41:51.728
ALL KNOW THAT- BUT- WE AGREE ON

04:41:51.794 --> 04:41:52.929
A DOCUMENT THAT IS A SET OF

04:41:52.996 --> 04:41:54.030
SYMBOLS ON THE SIDE OF

04:41:54.097 --> 04:41:55.832
EXPENDITURES OVER. I THINK IT

04:41:55.898 --> 04:41:58.401
WOULD BE NICE TO GO BACK THAT

04:41:58.468 --> 04:42:00.837
ESPECIALLY IN REGARDS TO STICK

04:42:00.903 --> 04:42:03.139
SPEND THE CHORE OF BILLIONS AND

04:42:03.206 --> 04:42:05.375
ENDS UP WITH YOU KNOW. TWENTY

04:42:05.441 --> 04:42:13.616
DOLLARS. SO AGAIN I THINK THAT

04:42:13.683 --> 04:42:16.919
THAT'S JUST MY A LIFE MY FINAL

04:42:16.986 --> 04:42:17.854
POINT JUST MAKING SURE THAT

04:42:17.920 --> 04:42:20.823
AGAIN WE- YOU KNOW WE HAVE A

04:42:20.890 --> 04:42:22.692
BUDGET PROCESS WE HAVE A BUDGET

04:42:22.759 --> 04:42:24.427
PROCESS AND HOW WE SPEND MONEY-

04:42:24.494 --> 04:42:26.796
OBVIOUSLY WE KNOW WERE IN AN

04:42:26.863 --> 04:42:29.365
EMERGENCY WHERE WE NEED TO

04:42:29.432 --> 04:42:31.434
EXPAND MONEY QUICKLY BUT ALSO

04:42:31.501 --> 04:42:34.103
ON HOW THE PROCESS WHERE WE ARE

04:42:34.170 --> 04:42:37.040
TRYING TO MANAGE OUR EXPENSE.

04:42:37.106 --> 04:42:40.777
WE ALREADY HOW FINE. WE GET OUR

04:42:40.843 --> 04:42:42.645
EXPECT WORSE BUDGET NEW HAS YOU

04:42:45.014 --> 04:42:46.582
WOULD DEFINITELY CONCUR WITH

04:42:46.649 --> 04:42:48.051
THAT TO THINK IT'S EVEN MORE

04:42:48.117 --> 04:42:49.018
