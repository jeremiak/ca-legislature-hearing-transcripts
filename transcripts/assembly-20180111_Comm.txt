PROVIDE LOCAL AUTHORITIES WITH RICK NOTICED AND LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES WITH THE LAW ENFORCEMENT IN OUR ACTION PLAN. VETO TO REGULATIONS THAT ARE CURRENTLY BEING PROPOSED BY DIEM V. THERE'S BROAD AGREEMENT THAT THESE. REGULATIONS. MAKE A LOT OF SENSE ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU ARE PUTTING THESE CARS% ON THE ROAD WITHOUT ANY PEOPLE IN THE VEHICLES. ARE UNFORTUNATE DMV IS MOVING AT THEIR VERY QUICK PACE AS ALWAYS JUST TAKE ABOUT TWO AND A HALF YEARS WITH NO. END IN SIGHT AND ARE CONCERNED I OR MY CONCERN IS THAT AS THESE OUTFITS TECHNOLOGY MOVES VERY QUICKLY WE WANT TO CONTINUE TO MOVE QUICKLY. THAT WE'RE GOING TO SEE MORE MORE DEPLOYMENT IN OUR CITIES. WE HAD THE UNFORTUNATE INCIDENT LAST YEAR WERE. CARS GOT DEPLOYED. BEFORE A D. M. V. SIGNED OFF ON. THESE VEHICLES AND OUR LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT HAD NO WAY TO GET THESE CARS OFF THE BROUGHT. ARE WE AS A CITY WERE ABSOLUTELY. INCENSED AT NOT BEING ABLE TO GET THESE VEHICLES ON THE ROAD SFPD CAN DO ANYTHING OUR AMERICAN DO ANYTHING. ON IT IS VERY VERY UNFORTUNATE BECAUSE. WANTED APOP INNING IS WE WERE TOLD THAT UNTIL THE A VEHICLES ACTUALLY BROKE THE LAW WHERE THEY HIT SOMEBODY OR DANGER TO ME WE CAN DO ANYTHING. SO OBVIOUSLY R. CREATED A VERY CHALLENGING SITUATION WHICH WE DON'T WANT TO BE IN BECAUSE WE WANT TO BE. VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THE TECHNOLOGY WHAT THE TECHNOLOGY BE TESTED VERY SAFELY I THINK THIS TECHNOLOGY IS COMING. MUCH MUCH FASTER THAN A LEASE I I THOUGHT. AND I THINK IT IS ACTUALLY VERY VERY EXCITING IN THE UP TO IS VERY EXCITING WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS EVERY WAITER POLICE OF THE STREET TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR STREETS. ARE SAFE ARM OTHER STATES JUST FOR EXAMPLE FOR TO ARIZONA ABOUT A VERY PASSED LEGISLATION AYE REGARDING THE TESTING OPERATION OF DRIVERLESS AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES. AND AGAIN. WE BELIEVE THIS IS A VERY SMALL STEP. BUT I THINK A VERY HELPFUL STEP IN THIS PROCESS. VERY GOOD YOU HAVE ANY OTHER WITNESSES YOU'D LIKE TO CALL FORWARD. THE MINISTER SHARON MEMBERS ROSE VERY SHE AND. PRESIDENT CONSUMERS FOR AUTO RELIABILITY SAFETY AND WE REALLY APPRECIATE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS TINGS LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE WE THINK THAT IT'S A VERY PRACTICAL MEASURE. VERY NARROWLY FOCUSED IT WILL ENHANCE SAFETY. RICK YOU. MR TURN MEMBERS SILVIUS ALICIA ON BEHALF OF THE CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO AS AN AYE ASSEMBLYMEMBER TING INDICATED WE ARE SUPPORTIVE OF THESE NEW TECHNOLOGIES HOWEVER WE DO NOT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS DO NEED TO BE INFORMED. AND PARTNERS IN THE PROCESS OF ROLLOUT AND TESTING OF THESE VEHICLES ON OUR STATE THE STREETS IN ORDER TO PROTECT PUBLIC SAFETY SO WE ASK YOUR SUPPORT. YOU'RE. AFTER A CLUSTER HERNANDEZ A WE HAVE THE CONSUMER FEDERATION OF CALIFORNIA ROLLS IN SUPPORT. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS AYE MISTER CHAIR. LAURA BENNETT WITH TECH NET EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR WE ARE MEMBERS SITUACIÃ³N LIBRARY CEOS WE HAVE OVER EIGHTY MEMBER COMPANIES THE INNOVATION. TECHNOLOGY SPACE TESTING IN THIS AREA AYE AS YOU KNOW THE DMB IS CURRENTLY ABOUT TO ADOPT THE REGULATIONS THE SPECIFIC TO DRIVER. I THOUGHT DRIVING EAGLES WITH NO DRIVER IN THE VEHICLE. THE LEGISLATION HAS A LANGUAGE A. FOR THESE REGULATIONS SPECIFIC TO LOCAL MEDICATION IN THE LAW ENFORCEMENT INTERACTION PLAN. OUR CONCERNS CODIFYING THIS LANGUAGE OF THIS TECHNOLOGY IS BRAND NEW. IT WILL TIE THE HANDS OF DE IN THE THEY WILL BE ABLE TO BE FLEXIBLE AND ADAPT TO THE TECHNOLOGY CHANGES AS WE MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS TECHNOLOGY. ODD FOR THOSE REASONS WE ASK FOR NO VOTE TODAY. FUTURE MEMBERS LIVE IN ALL TO MURDER HERE ON BEHALF OF GLOBAL AUTO MAKERS AND FOR THE REASONS JUST STATED A WE ARE ALSO IN OPPOSED IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY ADDITIONAL A WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION A MAMMOGRAM HALF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OPPOSITION. ANY QUESTIONS. FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. CHAIRMAN. WELL THANK YOU VERY THEY GOT THIS THING I THINK YOU WERE JUST AT MY PERHAPS OF VOTING AND SO MISTER. BUT AT THE. APPRECIATE THE INTENT MOST CERTAINLY FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO PROVIDE THE FRAMEWORK OF FOR THE TECHNOLOGIES THAT WE KNOW ARE DIDN'T EXISTENCE. BUT THE CONCERN I HAVE WHO. WITH RESPECT TO THE SIMILAR TO THE OPPOSITION WITH WITH RESPECT TO GETTING IN FRONT OF THE DMV WHICH IS TO SAY THAT. UNDERSTANDING THE LEGISLATIVE INTENT OF THOSE OF US AS THE LEGISLATIVE BODY GETTING IN FRONT OF THE REGULATORY AND AT THAT AT THAT YOU CAN HELP ELABORATE ON THE INSIDE AND GREAT EXAMPLE I THINK I TEND TO. ALSO FEEL THAT WAY IN MANY CASES I THINK IN THIS CASE WE INTRODUCED THIS BILL. A LAST TRIP THIS TIME AND WE ACTUALLY HELD IT THE THE PROVISIONS WITHIN THE BILL WERE ACTUALLY MUCH STRONGER IN TERMS OF. A WHAT WE ALLOWED LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT TO DO US WOULD PURPOSELY WAITED HELD BACK. WANTED TO SEE WHAT DIEM BE WAS GOING TO DO IT WAS OUR HOPE THAT DIEM VIEW COULD HAVE RATIFIED THESE REGULATIONS LAST YEAR. SO A YEAR LATER. WE HAVE ON THEM REGULATIONS THAT ARE THERE IN IN AGREEMENT BUT IF FOR WHATEVER REASON THEY HAVEN'T BEEN COMPLETELY. RATIFIED BY THE DEPARTMENTS I THINK A WEEK VERY RESPECTFUL OF WHAT DIEM V. NEEDS TO DO. THEY NEED TO DO THEIR JOB BUT I THINK AS A LAWMAKERS WITH TO DO OUR JOB AS WELL TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE PROTECTING OUR CITIZENS OUR STREETS. A DMV AS YOU KNOW THEY AND THEY DON'T REALLY HEAR OUR CONSTITUENTS WHEN THEY COMPLAIN THEY CALL OUR OFFICES. WHEN WHEN LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT NEEDS HELP CLEAN WITH THE OPPOSITION TO SEE IF. WE CAN FIND AGREEMENT I AND I UNDERSTAND. THEIR THEIR OBJECTION I THINK IT'S VERY REASONABLE THAT WORKING THROUGH THIS PROCESS BUT WE ALSO FEEL THAT AT THIS POINT HOME WE DON'T WANT TO WAIT FOREVER FOR THESE REGULATIONS TO NOT. HERE TO BE CODIFIED R. MADE MAYBE THEY'LL NEVER BECOME. TICKET. AB. I THINK MR TING FOR FOR BEGIN THIS THIS BILL FORWARD UP ARE YOU SEE THAT YOU KNOW I THINK WE ALL AGREE THAT THAT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WE ACT ACTING HAVE THE SAFETY OF OUR CONSTITUENTS IN I RESIDENT. I DID JUST WANNA. ECHO SOME THE CONCERNS MADE BY MISTER LOW JUST ABOUT THE SORT OF POTENTIAL DUPLICATIVE. ARM NATURE. MAYBE ALSO. I'M HAVING A LITTLE LESS WITH THEM. AWHILE AGO SO WASN'T JUST OBVIOUSLY THE BILL WAS JUST CHANGED IMPRINT ON LAST WEEK BUT THE INFORMATION THAT WE PUT IN PRINT WAS SHARED WITH THEM. AWHILE AGO OF THAT THAT'S WHY WE CHOSE WHO WE BELIEVE THAT THE TWO PROVISIONS AROUND LAW ENFORCEMENT AND ALSO THE ONES THAT REALLY WE DON'T ANTICIPATE CHANGING. WE WE THINK WHAT'S THESE VEHICLES NEED TO BE DEPLOYED THERE SHOULD BE A LAW ENFORCEMENT PLAN PERHAPS TO BE A LAW ENFORCEMENT PLANT AND EVERY SINGLE ONE OF OUR KITTIES CATHOLIC THE MINIMUM. THE OTHER MINIMUM SHOULD BE THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT SHOULD BE INFORMED WHERE THIS TESTING IS GOING TO TAKE PLACE. SO THAT THEY CAN IF THEY NEED TO PROVIDE EXTRA SECURITY ARE THEY NEED TO. BE AWARE OF THE SITUATION THAT THEY CAN THEY CAN MONITOR BILLY USE THAT AS OUR GUIDES. THAT'S REALLY ALL THE PROVISIONS THAT WERE CODIFIED SO AGAIN TO MEET THE OTHER PROVISIONS THAT. FORM THE VERY BASELINE OF SAFETY THE ABSOLUTE MINIMUM STANDARDS SAFETY OBVIOUSLY THE REGULATIONS THAT ARE BEING CODIFIED DISCUSS ARE GONNA BE DOING A WHOLE LOT MORE THAN THAT. BUT THIS TO ME OUR HELPS ENSURE THAT WE HAVE A BASELINE OF SAFETY WITH THE BASELINE OF A HAVING THESE COMPANIES WORK DIRECTLY WITH LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT WHICH I THINK IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT RIGHT NOW THE PRIMARY INTERACTIONS WITH DMV. SO THERE'S NOT ANY OBLIGATION NECESSARILY BUT LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT SO THIS DISQUALIFIES THAT ARE AS THIS TECHNOLOGY IS DEPLOYED NOT ONLY SHOULD YOU BE WORKING FOR THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK WITH DMB BUT THAT YOU REALLY NEED TO BE. TALKING HANDED AND HAVING A PLAN WITH LOCAL LAW FIRST BECAUSE IN THE END THEY'RE THE ONES CHARGED WITH. PROVIDING SAFETY OUR STREETS. I THINK MR TO. YES I AM. SOME MIGHT THINK IT RINGS BEFORE OF A SHE WITH MY BACKGROUND OF PUBLIC SAFETY IN AND. MAKE SURE THAT WE PROVIDE THE. FOLKS OUT THERE THAT ARE TAKING CARE OF US WITH THIS THE POLICE OR FIRE DEPARTMENTS BECAUSE OF SEE THERE'S A LOT LIKE TRUNKS IN THESE VEHICLES. HOW DO THEY RESPOND TO THESE ACCIDENTS ON THE FREEWAY OR SPIDER INTO A BUILDING? THERE'S LOT TECHNOLOGY OUT THERE THAT I THINK FOR THE RIGHT REASONS WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WE. HAVE THAT DISCUSSION WITH WITH THE POLICE FIRE PLEASE DEPARTMENT PART FROM THE LOCAL AGENCIES PROVIDING SERVICE. BECAUSE IT IS A TECHNOLOGIST INVOLVING CHANGING DAY BY DAY BUT JUST ONE VICTORY CONTINUE HAVING THAT DISCUSSION WITH OPPOSITION HOPING I THINK. TO THEIR ISSUES AS WELL BUT IT'S SOMETHING THAT DEFINITELY NEED TO MAKE SURE COMMITTEES ARE SAFE. MORE THESE OF BECAUSE BE OPERATING THANK YOU ABSOLUTE THANK YOU AND AND YEAH WE GOT MY COMMITTEE WILL CONTINUE TO KEEP WORKING WITH OPPOSITION ABSOLUTE. BUT SEE ANYMORE COMMENTS I WAS GONNA MOVE THE BILL. CLICK. JUST A REALLY APPRECIATE ALL THE ALL THE COMMENTS AGAIN WE WANT TO CONTINUE WORK WITH.
