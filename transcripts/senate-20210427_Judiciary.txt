THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBER I STAND HERE BEFORE YOU TODAY TO PRESERVE S. TWO. BETTER KNOWN AS THE KEY ROTH JUNIOR PLEASE BE SURE TO FOR ACT OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THIS BILL IS NOT NEW TO ANY HERE IN THE- BECAUSE- WE THIS BILL ALLOW HERE. AS A B. SEVEN THREE ONE. I'M HONORED STAND HERE TODAY TO HAVE THE PROTIUM AS A JOINT AUTHORS. ALONG WITH MYSELF. OF THIS PRIORITY LEGISLATION. NOT ONLY FOR THE LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS. NOT ONLY FOR CALIFORNIA BUT IT SHOULD BE FOR ALL OF AMERICA. KENNETH ROSS JUNIOR WAS A VIBRANT TWENTY FIVE YEAR OLD YOUNG MAN WHO GREW UP IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD. HE WAS SIMPLY RUNNING ACROSS A PARK. THREE YEARS AGO. WHEN HE WAS SHOT IN THE BACK TWICE BY A R. FIFTEEN BY A GUARDIAN A POLICE OFFICER AN OFFICER WHO HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY EMPLOYED. BY ORANGE COUNTY POLICE AGENCY AND YET LEFT THERE ONLY TO BE HIRED BY THE CITY OF GARDENA AFTER HE HAD BEEN INVOLVED IN THREE PREVIOUS SHOOTING INCIDENTS IN ORANGE COUNTY. THIS BILL WOULD CREATE A STATEWIDE PROCESS TO REVOKE THE CERTIFICATION OF AN OFFICER AFTER THE CONVICTION OF SERIOUS CRIMES OR TERMINATION FROM EMPLOYMENT DUE TO MISCONDUCT. WE ARE NOW ONE OF ONLY FOUR STATES IN THE NATION IT DOESN'T HAVE A PRAYER AND A CRUEL THE CERTIFICATION PROCESS FOR BAD OFFICERS. ARE GOVERNOR OFTEN LIKE TO SAY THAT CALIFORNIA IS THE NEXT COMING ATTRACTION WE LEADING TECHNOLOGY WE LEAD IN ENVIRONMENT WE LEAD AND ALL THOSE THINGS THAT IMPORTANT EXCEPT FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM I HOPE TODAY YOU WILL JOIN US AND JOIN ME IN MAKING CALIFORNIA THE NEXT LEADING A TRACTOR WHEN IT COMES TO MEANINGFUL POLICE REFORM. DOES IS A TO REVOKE TO SERVE. OR OF BAD DAY. LAWYERS EVEN BARBERS COMP CONVERT. YOU CAN EVEN RECALL ELECTED OFFICIAL BUT IS UNABLE TO DE CERTIFY. POLICE OFFICERS WHO HAVE BROKEN THE LAW AND VIOLATED PUBLIC TRUST. BILL WOULD CREATE A FAIR AND AFFECT THE PROCESS TO ENSURE THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS WHO BREAK THE PUBLIC TRUST BY HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR ACTIONS AND NOT ALLOW THE SIMPLY MOVED FROM ONE AGENCY ARE IN ONE DEPARTMENT TO THE NOT A TO ANOTHER HOUSE WITH. THE OFFICER WHO SHOT HIM ROSS JUNIOR. ADDITIONALLY THIS BILL ALLOWS THE COMMISSION ON PEACE OFFICERS AND STANDARDS IN TRAINING BETTER KNOWN AS POST. THE COMMISSION THAT IS PRIMARILY MADE UP OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. TO INVESTIGATE GROUNDS OF OFFICERS MISCONDUCT. AUTHORITIES IMPORTANT TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE CREATING AN EFFECTIVE THE CERTIFICATION SYSTEM. WOULD ALSO CREATE AN ADVISORY BOARD WITH IMPOSED THAT WOULD MAKE INITIAL RECOMMENDATIONS ON WHETHER POLL SHOULD BE CERTIFIED OFFICER OR NOT. FINALLY THIS BILL ALLOWS THE COMMISSION DEFINE BY REGULATION THIS BILL SPECIFIC GROUNDS OF SERIOUS MISCONDUCT THAT WOULD BE CONSIDERED FOR DECERTIFICATION. SEVERAL OF THESE EGREGIOUS BROWN'S ARE LAID OUT IN THIS MEASURE. SUCH A SEXUAL SAW THIS HONESTY. A BRIEF THE ABUSE OF POWER. TAMPERING WITH THE EVIDENCE BUT ULTIMATELY THE COMMISSION HAS THE AUTHORITY TO FIND EXACTLY WHAT MISCONDUCT IS THAT COULD LEAD TO THE DEATH CERT OF AN OFFICER. WE FILL THIS APPROACH IS FAIR. IT IS NOT A RADICAL APPROACH TO WHAT OTHER OR WHAT I SHOULD SAY WHAT MANY OTHER STATES ARE CURRENTLY DOING. CERTAINLY THIS BILL MAKES CHANGES. TO STRENGTHEN THE TOM BAIN CIVIL RIGHTS ACT. IT ENSURES THAT A FAMILY MEMBER OF A PERSON KILLED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT IS ALSO ABLE TO ASSERT IT CALLS OF ACTION UNDER THE BAN ACT. IT CLARIFIES THAT THREE OF THE MOST EGREGIOUS IMMUNITIES CALMLY ASSERTED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT ARE NOT APPLICABLE. APPLICABLE I SHOULD SAY THE CLAIMS BROUGHT UNDER THE BANNER. THESE INCLUDE PLANTING EVIDENCE OR FRAMING SOMEONE. ENTERING A PRISONER. ARE FAILING TO PROVIDE CARE A RENDER AID TO A PERSON- A PRISONER THAT IS IN YOUR CUSTODY. WHERE MANY IN THE BILL TO CLARIFY THAT WE ARE REMOVING THESE IMMUNITIES FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS SPECIFICALLY. LASTLY I WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE REGARDING SECTION TO SECTION BE TWO OF THE BANNACK AS IT RELATES TO THE STANDARD OF INTENT THAT IS APPLE CO TO THE BLACK BANNACK CLAIMS. WE HAVE OFFERED AMENDMENTS THROUGHOUT THE WEEKEND TO ADDRESS. THE CHAIRED. AND AT EVERY TURN. THEY DO NOT GO FAR ENOUGHAND HAVE BEEN REJECTED. I HAVE COPIES OF ALL THREE. MIMIDS THAT WE HAVE BROUGHT FORTH OVER THE LAST. TWENTY FOUR FORTY EIGHT HOURS I'LL BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO PROVIDE INTO EACH AND EVERY MEMBER SO THEY CAN REVIEW FOR THEMSELVES. WE HAVE OFFERED MEMBERS AGAIN THROUGHOUT THE WEEKEND THE DON'T GO FAR ENOUGH FIRST WE HAVE TRIED TO THE LEAKED. SOME DEFINITIONS THEN WE BELIEVE OTHER PROVISIONS REGARDING INTERFERENCE. THEM WE SUGGESTED THAT THE ENTIRE SUBS SUB DIVISION BE REMOTE THINKING SURELY THIS WOULD BE ACCEPTED. BUT ONCE AGAIN IT WAS ONLY REJECTED WE HAVE OFFERED AMENDMENTS TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT NEGLIGENCE IS NOT SUFFICIENT. IT SEEMS THE ONLY THING THAT WOULD SATISFY THE COMMITTEE WOULD BE TO REMOVE THE CHANGES TO THE BAN ACT IN ITS ENTIRETY. MEMBERS. WHY DO BLACK AND BROWN PEOPLE HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN THEIR LIVES AND THEIR JUSTICE. BETWEEN THEIR HOPES AND THEIR PEACE BETWEEN THEIR PROTECTION AND FREEDOM. WHEN WILL BLACK PEOPLE HAVE TO START CHOOSING BETWEEN MEETING THEIR EXPECTATIONS OR US FOR FILLING. OUR PROMISES. CHANGE MUST COME TO POLICING THE CALIFORNIA AND CHANGES NEEDED NOW MEANING MEANINGFUL REFORM NOT JUST SUPERFICIAL CHANGES NIBBLING AROUND THE EDGES THE KEEP THE STATUS QUO IN PLACE THAT ALLOWS POLICE TO BE ACCOUNTABLE ONLY TO THEMSELVES. HOW MANY MORE BILL GARDNER DO WE NEED. HOW MANY MORE STEPHON CLARK'S DO WE NEED HOW MANY MORE EASIER FOR TO DO WE NEED. HOW MANY MORE DANTE. WELCOME WE NEED HOW MANY MORE UNDER GUARDADO'S WE NEED. MORE REGGIE AB- ORIGINAL RODNEY KING DO WE- HOW MANY MORE MIRAI IS TO A- I GO ON AND ON AND ON ABOUT THE MAN. ONE COMMON THREAD ALL THE NAMES THAT WE CONTINUE TO MENTION IS THAT THERE ARE BLACK AND BROWN. I ASSURE YOU. IF MY WHITE COLLEAGUES WILL BE KILLED AND BRUTALIZED AT THE SAME RATE AS POLICE OFFICERS THEY WOULD NOT ONLY BE STANDING IN THE STREET SANDY BONTA BROUGH POLICE BUT THEY DEFINITELY WOULD SAY THIS ON THE POLICE. A RECENT SURVEY. OF OVER EIGHT THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS FOUND THAT EITHER DECERTIFYING. OR REMOVING LEGAL IMMUNITY FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS. ONLY 19% WE'RE NOT SUPPORT OF. CALIFORNIA DESERVE LAW ENFORCEMENT THAT THEY CAN TRUST THAT WILL TREAT THEM FAIRLY. AND WE WHAT AND WILL HOLD ACCOUNTABLE WHEN THEY ABUSE THAT TRUST. THIS BILL IS A PRIORITY AS I STATED FOR THE LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS IT'S A PRIORITY FOR ME AS A BLACK MAN WHOSE EXPERIENCE MANY OF THESE INDIGNITIES LAW ENFORCEMENT IT'S SUPPORTED BY A WALL OF COMMUNITY AND GRASSROOTS ORGANIZATIONS. AND SUPPORTED BY THOUSANDS IF NOT MILLIONS OF AMERICANS WHO SAID ANOTHER WAS ENOUGH IN THE WORDS OF FANNIE LOU HAMER WE'RE SICK AND TIRED OF BEING SICK AND TIRED. WHO TESTIFIED IT'S OF THIS MEASURES WILL TEACH OUR BRAVE. MOTHER OF MORE SYRUP. BEREN AND OF STOP. BECAUSE DOUGLAS BOARD MEMBERS UP IN ATTORNEYS OF CALIFORNIA WE ALSO HAVE JULIE YOU PRESIDENT OF THE NATIONAL POLICE ACCOUNTABILITY PROJECT AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS MEMBERS ARE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR BRADFORD- LET'S FIRST TURN TO- MISTER. MISTER CARL DOUGLAS IS AVAILABLE. YES CENTER I AM MISTER DOUGLAS THE FLOOR IS YOURS. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN- BURKE AND OTHERS MY NAME IS CARL DOUGLAS AND FOR FORTY ONE YEARS HI THE REPRESENTED CALIFORNIANS UP AND DOWN THE STATE- BEEN INJURED DUE TO THE WRONGFUL CONDUCT OF POLICE OFFICERS. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN I TELL YOU FORTY ONE YEARS I'VE BEEN DOING THIS. I HELP THEM PUT THEIR LIVES BACK TOGETHER AFTER THEY'VE BEEN INJURED. I COME BEFORE YOU TODAY ADVOCATING FOR THE ADOPTION OF SB TWO. THIS MATTER IS A REAL FOR ME BECAUSE I REPRESENT CANADA LOST A THIRD MISTER ROSS INTENSE SUDDEN A YOUNG BOY WHO LOST HIS FATHER FAR TOO YOUNG. THE BILL PROPOSES THREE ADJUSTMENTS TO THE TOM BANG CIVIL RIGHTS ACT. THE NEED FOR EACH OF THESE CHANGES WHICH I'M SUPPORTING WORK CREATED BY THE COURT SYSTEM AND WE'RE NEVER CONTEMPLATED BY TOM BAIN WHEN THE ACT WAS FIRST PASSED IN THE MID EIGHTIES. THE MOST IMPORTANT OF THESE CHANGES WOULD ADJUST THE MENTAL INTENT REQUIREMENT NEEDED TO APPROVE A VIOLATION OF THE ACT BRINGING IT IN ALIGNMENT WITH FEDERAL LAW. SO IF I WERE TO SUE A POLICE OFFICER FOR SHOOTING AN UNARMED BLACK MAN FOR EXAMPLE. UNDER CURRENT LAW I HAVE TO PROVE NOT ONLY THAT THE OFFICER INTEND TO FIRE THE GUN WHICH IS CALLED A GENERAL INTENT. BUT THERE'S A SECOND LAYER OF PROOF WHICH WOULD REQUIRE ME TO PROVE THAT THAT SAME OFFICER ALSO INTENDED TO VIOLATE MY CLIENT CIVIL RIGHT. THAT IS AN ADDED AREA THAT WE WANT TO ELIMINATE SINCE WAS NOT IN BY THE ORIGINAL DRAFTERS THE ACT. THE SECOND CHANGE CORRECT THE FUNDAMENTALLY. RESULT IN MY EXAMPLE THAT IF THE BULLET THE OFFICERS BY YOUR HELLO I'VE MICHAEL LIFE. HE COULD DAMAGE. BUT IF THAT SAID BULLET HAPPENED TO HIM. INSTEAD OF I HIM. UNDER THE CAR DAY ACT I WOULD BE PER FOR FIVE A- DEATH. ON BEHALF OF HIS FAMILY. THAT I WAS FOR TO GO TO COURT TO PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF CAN WATER. THE THIRD CHANGE WOULD ALLOW SOME OF THE WHICH PREVENTS CAL. FROM SO PUBLIC AND FOR INJURIES AND DEATHS.

YES SIR ALL RIGHT MISMAS TECHNIQUE TWO MINUTES. THANK YOU SENATORS FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK BEFORE YOU TODAY I DO WANT TO I I'M SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF IRAQ AND I DO WANT TO REITERATE- WHAT MY COLLEAGUE MISTER FELDMAN IS GONNA ALSO SAY AND THAT IS THAT. WE SUPPORT A LICENSE THE CERTIFICATION REGIME. UNFORTUNATELY SB TWO FAILS BASIC DUE PROCESS REQUIREMENTS FOR THAT I KNOW THAT'S NOT WHY WE'RE HERE TODAY SO I'M GOING TO FOCUS MY COMMENTS ON THE BANE ACT BUT I AM HAPPY TO ENTERTAIN ANY QUESTIONS REGARDING THE LICENSING ASPECT. IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT THE BAN ACT IS A STATUTE THAT WAS INTENDED TO ADDRESS HATE CRIMES BY PROVIDING ENHANCED LIABILITY. MEETING ATTORNEY FEES WITH MULTIPLIERS STATUTORY DAMAGES INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND EVEN CRIMINAL. SANCTIONS IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES FOR INTENTIONAL VIOLATIONS OF CIVIL RIGHTS. THERE IS NO QUALIFIED IMMUNITY THAT IS AVAILABLE TO PEACE OFFICERS UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW OR THE BAN ACT AS IT STANDS TODAY. THE MAIN ACT IS NOT A GENERAL TORT LIABILITY STATUTE BUT RATHER IS TO ADDRESS SPECIFIC PROBLEMS THERE ARE OTHER REMEDIES THAT ARE AVAILABLE FOR CIRCUMSTANCES THAT DON'T NEED THAT. UNDERSTANDABLY HIGHER REQUIREMENTS FOR THE PAIN ACT THERE'S BACK. ASSAULT NEGLIGENCE INTENTIONAL INFLICTION OF EMOTIONAL DISTRESS AND EVEN WRONGFUL DEATH CLAIMS THEY'RE AVAILABLE UNDER GENERAL TORT LAW IN CALIFORNIA THE NINTH CIRCUIT RECENTLY IN A CASE CALLED THE BEARS VERSUS HUNTINGTON BEACH. ISSUED A PUBLISHED DECISION RECOGNIZING THAT GENERAL NEGLIGENCE CAN PROVIDE RELIEF BEYOND THE PAIN ACT AND EVEN NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE IN EXCESSIVE FORCE CASES. THIS BILL WOULD ALSO AFFECT NOT JUST LAW ENFORCEMENT BUT ALL PUBLIC EMPLOYEES IN CALIFORNIA. IN FACT MANY OF THE CASES UNDER THE BAN ACT INVOLVED TEACHERS AND SOCIAL WORKERS THERE'S PUBLISHED CASES INVOLVING BAY NOT CLAIMS AGAINST DANGEROUS YOU MISTER MILLER AG IF YOU'D WRAP IT UP. YES FOR VIOLATING EQUAL ACCESS UNDER THE ADA FOR REFUSING TO KEEP THAT CHILDREN AND NOT FREE ENVIRONMENT ANYTIME BANKING THANK YOU MR MUSEVENI. WE'RE GONNA NOW TURN TO MR FELTMAN MR FELDMAN ARE YOU ON THE LINE. YES SIR HI MISTER FILMON GO HEAD. J. MEMBERS JONATHAN FELDMAN ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA POLICE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION I WANT TO START BY SAYING THAT EPCA EMPATHIZES WITH ANYONE WHO'S LOST A LOVED ONE AND FULLY SUPPORTS A DEEPER CERTIFICATION SYSTEM THAT PERMANENTLY REMOVES OFFICERS GUILTY OF SEARCH MCCARTY MISCONDUCT. INCLUDING EXCESSIVE FOR SEXUAL ASSAULT THAT'S ON YOUR. RACIAL BIAS. WE'LL GET A RADICALLY HOWEVER WE ARE OPPOSED SB. WHICH NOT ONLY CAN TRAIN I LIKE GAME BUT SWEEPING CHANGES TO CIVIL. EXPOSURE AND BAN ACT. WHICH OF THE COMMITTEES DRASTIC ALTHOUGH THEIR- AS WE TO MAKE SURE MAJOR CHAIN TO THE BAY ACT. THE STATE FROM SPECIFIC AND TO J. OKAY. IT INTRODUCE ON PRODUCT CLAIMS AND THE BANNER AND IT'LL ST DAYTON. ARE THE FIRST TWO ARE THE- PHONE WORKING. ALL TARGET I CALL THERE AND THE GENERAL FAN MSP TO IT ONLY NEEDS TO BE PROVEN A PERSON. TO ACT NOW THE BANK TO BUY THE RIGHTS OF ANOTHER. OR DID SO. OR DELIVER. THIS IS CAN GIVEN THE FACT THAT WE OFTEN TASK PUBLIC EMPLOYEES POLICE OFFICERS SOCIAL WORKERS TEACHERS. JOBS AT OCCASIONALLY PLACEMENT SITUATIONS OR CHOIR THAN TO TAKE ACTIONS. THAT MAY HAVE BRIDGE A PERSON'S RIGHT. IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO SEND SHOW WAS BY. WE NEED PROOF INDIVIDUAL EITHER I TO LIVE. RECKLESSLY OR WITH THE INTENT TO VIOLATE THE RIGHTS. OF STANDARD OF GENERAL INTENT AS IN SB TWO FORTIES OPPOSITE OTHER PUBLIC EMPLOYEES TO AN UNTENABLE STANDARD. ADDITIONALLY BY PLACING WRONGFUL DEATH LIABILITY INTO THE BAND ACT WE WILL SEE THOSE CASES. WHICH ARE NOW THAT WITH IN FEDERAL COURT MOVE INTO STATE COURT. THIS IS SIGNIFICANT. THERE IS NO QUALIFIED IMMUNITY IN STATE COURT. AS TWO THEREFORE THANK LOW. AND DOES NOT ACCOUNT. FOR OFFICERS ACTUAL INTENT OR RECKLESS DECISION AND EFFECTIVELY ELIMINATE QUALIFIED IMMUNITY IN WRONGFUL DEATH CASES. THESE ARE MONUMENTAL CHANGES. IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE BAN ACT AS MY COLLEAGUE STATED- IS NOT THE ONLY- STATUTE. THAT SOMEONE CAN FILE UNDER FOR LEGAL REMEDY IN THESE CASES AND INVESTED- SEVERAL.

I WILL NOW BRING IT BACK TO THE FLOOR I SEE SENATOR RUSSELL AND I SEE CENTER BOARD JUST SENATOR RUSSELL. I SEE CENTER WIENER IN CENTER HERTZBERG. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I'D LIKE TO MOVE THE BILL WHEN IT'S APPROPRIATE. AND UP I ALSO WANT TO THANK THE- AUTHOR OF THE BILL WHO WORKS VERY VERY HARD. TO TRY TO REFORM OUR POLICE SYSTEM. BECAUSE WE DO NEED TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY. WE ALL HAVE RESPECT AND APPRECIATION FOR THE MAJORITY OF POLICE OFFICERS THAT DO SERVE HONORABLY AND THEY PUT THEIR LIVES AT RISK. AT THE SAME TIME WE SHOULD NOT HAVE TO CHOOSE. OVER THE DISPARITIES THAT EXIST WITHIN OUR SYSTEM. BLACK AND LATINO COMMUNITIES FACE A POLICING AND JUSTICE SYSTEM THAT SIMPLY DOES NOT TREAT THEM FAIRLY TREAT US FAIRLY. WE MUST TAKE ACTIONS TO BEGIN THE PROCESS OF RESTORING TRUST WITHIN OUR COMMUNITIES AND THE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES THAT OPERATE WITHIN THEM. ADDRESSING THE INJUSTICES WITHIN OUR SYSTEM SHOULD NOT BE A POLITICAL ISSUE IT SHOULD NOT BE A BLACK ISSUE OR LATINO ISSUE. WHAT ARE POLICING SYSTEM HARMS INDIVIDUALS BECAUSE OF THE COLOR OF OUR SKIN THAT SHOULD MATTER TO ALL OF US. A CULTURE OF POLICING IN THIS COUNTRY MUST CHANGE. SB TWO IS A NECESSARYSTEP TO MAKE SURE THE INSTITUTIONS RESPONSIBLE FOR EVERYDAY RIGHTS OF OUR SAFETY ARE ACCOUNTABLE TO THE COMMUNITIES THEY SERVE. WITHOUT ACCOUNTABILITY AND WITHOUT TRANSPARENCY WE CANNOT REBUILD THE PROCESS OF TRUST. WE SHOULD NOT HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN SUPPORTING OUR COMMUNITIES OR LAW ENFORCEMENT THIS I NOT AN US VERSUS DIVIDE WE WANT TO CREATE THE SYSTEMS IN PLACE TO MAKE OUR OMMUNITY SAFER. AND FIND COMMON GROUND. AND WITH OUR PUBLIC SAFETY AGENCIES I URGE AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU SENATOR ALSO SIR BORDERS. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT. THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A VERY CHARGED ISSUE OF FOR OUR COMMUNITIES AND OUR FRANKLY OUR NATION. BUT I WANT TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT WE. WE LOOK AT THIS- WITH THE SOBRE APPROACH AND MAKE CERTAIN THAT- WE ARE CREATING THE BEST POLICY TO ADDRESS THE COMPELLING IS THAT WE HAVE- WITHIN OUR COMMUNITIES. I THINK WE'VE HEARD THAT- FROM SOME OF THE COLORS THAT EVEN THE POLICE FORCE LAW ENFORCEMENT FORCE- IT IS OPEN TO DECERTIFICATION SO I KNOW IT SOUNDS LIKE THERE'S A WILLINGNESS. TO ADJUST TO SOME OF THE CHANGES THAT ARE NEEDED. ALL OF THE CONCERNS THAT I HAVE ABOUT THIS IS THAT THIS. COMMISSION AND FORGIVE ME I DON'T KNOW IF THERE BEEN ANY COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN ADOPTED OR PUT FORWARD. ON MAKE CERTAIN THAT MY COMMENTS ARE UP TO DATE. I'M NOT AWARE OF ANY BUT THAT THIS COMMISSION WOULD BE. SUPERIOR TO POST. AND I THINK WHEN THE AUTHOR OPENED UP WITH HIS COMMENTS HE TALKED ABOUT THE ACCREDITING BODIES WHETHER BEING THE BAR ASSOCIATION OR THE MEDICAL BOARDS THAT'S ACTUALLY ACCURATE INDIVIDUAL LAWYERS AND DOCTORS CAN HAVE THEIR LICENSES REMOVED FOR MISCONDUCT AND THAT'S ENTIRELY APPROPRIATE. THERE'S BAD APPLES IN EVERY SINGLE PROFESSION NEED TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. I THINK ONE OF THE CONCERNS THAT I HAVE HERE IS THAT THE COMMISSION THOUGH IT IS. GOING TO BE SUPERIOR TO POST. AND THAT. THE MAJORITY OF THE MEMBERS ON THIS COMMISSION COULD BE MADE UP OF INDIVIDUALS BUT DO NOT HAVE A BACKGROUND IN THE FIELD WEATHER- MY UNDERSTANDING THERE'S TWO INDIVIDUALS FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT POLICE TO FROM ACADEMIA. AND THE REST MIGHT BE MADE UP OF OTHER APPOINTEES INCLUDING THOSE AGGRIEVED BY POLICE MISCONDUCT FOR TOTAL I THINK OF NINE. BUT IF WE WERE TO ADD UP THE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE MANDATED TO HAVE A BACKGROUND IN POLICE REFORM OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE. IT WOULD BE A MINORITY. ON THE BOARD. AND SO. THE CRITERIA THAT I'M LOOKING AT HERE. IS TERRIBLY BROAD AND IF I MAY SHARE REFERS SOME OF THE PROVISIONS. IN THIS BILL IN POINT MY EYES ARE GOING EXCUSE ME- IS IT. GROUNDS FOR REMOVAL- DECERTIFICATION WOULD BE ACTS OF DISHONESTY. WE HAVE. ZACKS DEMONSTRATING BIAS- BASED ON RELIGION OR GENDER IDENTITY. AND FELIZ KINDA GOES ON BUT I DON'T THINK I UNDERSTAND THE RATIONALE FOR MAKING THIS COMMISSION SUPERIOR. TO POST. WOULD IT NOT MAKE MORE SENSE FOR THE COMMISSION TO OFFER RECOMMENDATIONS TO POST. AND IT MAY BE RE CALIBRATE HELP POST. IS DETERMINING WHETHER NOT INDIVIDUAL OFFICERS BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE WITH IT IF THEY LOSE THEIR CERTIFICATION OR OR NOT. BUT I'M LOOKING AT WHAT I THINK IS. ATTENTIONAL ACCOUNTABILITY INSTITUTIONS FOR EXAMPLE YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE INTERNAL AFFAIRS. YOU COULD POSSIBLY HAVE THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE FOR MISCONDUCT. IF YOU HAPPEN TO BE LIVING IN A CITY OR MUNICIPALITY OR A COUNTY THAT HAS A POLICE AUDITOR. THAT'S NUMBER THREE AND NOW THIS COULD BE FOR SO POLICE OFFICER COULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE BY FOUR SEPARATE ENTITIES- WHICH I THINK MIGHT BE A BIT MUCH. BUT ULTIMATELY. I WOULD THINK THAT IF LAW ENFORCEMENT IS WILLING TO DISCUSS THIS FURTHER THE DECERTIFICATION ISSUE THAT MAYBE IT WOULD BE WORSE CONTINUING THESE CONVERSATIONS SEE WHAT COMMON GROUND COULD EXIST. I AM I IMAGINE YOU'VE MADE THOSE OVERTURES- BUT ULTIMATELY IT MY CONCERN IS THAT A COMMISSION LIKE THIS SHOULD NOT BE SUPERIOR. FIVE TO POST AND HOURS AGO ALONG WITH THAT I THINK COULD BE DANGEROUS ESPECIALLY MADE UP OF INDIVIDUALS A MAJORITY OF WHICH MIGHT NOT BE MINE I HAVE A BACKGROUND IN CRIMINAL JUSTICE. AND I BELIEVE THE LAWYERS AND THE DOCTORS THAT WOULD REVIEW- CERTIFICATION ISSUES AT THEIR LEVEL OUR HAVE THE APPROPRIATE BACKGROUND IN. LAW OR MEDICINE. BUT THOSE ARE JUST SO MY COMMENTS SHARE AND I'LL LEAVE IT UP TO THE AUTHOR IF YOU WANT TO COMMENT. ON THOSE IN HIS CLOSING OR WHENEVER HE SEES FIT. SENATE CENTER BRADFORD WOULD LIKE TO RESPOND NOW IN YOUR CLOTHES HOW DO TO MICHAEL'S ALL RIGHT THANK YOU- ALL RIGHT OF CENTER WIENER. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN- I SUPPORT SB TWO AND I'M PROUD TO CO AUTHOR AND I REALLY WANT TO THANK. THE AUTHOR FOR HIS PERSISTENCE AND I HAVE TO THIS- BILL IN ITS PREVIOUS FORM- FALTERED DURING THE TUMULTUOUS END OF SESSION. LAST YEAR FOR REGROUPING AND COMING BACK WITH ANOTHER STRONG- WITH ANOTHER STRONG BILL ON MIKE. COME WITH THIS I MAY HAVE A- BUT NOW THE- ATTORNEY GENERAL BONTA IS NOT IN THE LEGISLATURE ANYMORE I MAY BE THE ONLY MEMBER OF THE LEGISLATURE AND MIGHT BE WRONG BUT I THINK I MIGHT BE THE ONLY NUMBER WHO IS ACTUALLY LITIGATED- THESE CASES ARE BOTH UNDER THE MAIN ACT AND UNDER SECTION NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE MR BONTA NEVER COLLEAGUES IN THE SAN FRANCISCO CITY ATTORNEY'S OFFICE TOGETHER ON THE SAME. TEAM HANDLING THESE AND OTHER CASES. AND SO I HAVE. HANDLED THESE CLAIMS BOTH FEDERAL AND- STATE CLAIMS IN FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT IN SUPERIOR COURT. ON APPEAL. AND SO FORTH AND I'VE SEEN THE GOOD THE BAD. AND THE UGLY. AND THE CHALLENGE YOU KNOW AND LOOK AT THE BIG PICTURE- WHEN MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC. HAVE A PERCEPTION I AM PARTICULARLY WHEN THAT PERCEPTION IS COMPLETELY JUSTIFIED THE POLICE OFFICERS CAN ACT WITH IMPUNITY AND THIS IS NOT THE BROAD BRUSH ALL OFFICERS BUT THAT POLICE OFFICERS- WHO HARM PEOPLE AND WHO VIOLATE THE LAW CAN DO SO WITH IMPUNITY. THAT IS SO DAMAGING. THIRD TO THE SYSTEM IS SO DAMAGING TO THE ABILITY TO HAVE EFFECTIVE POLICING OF PEOPLE THANK AN OFFICER CAN DO WHATEVER THEY WANT. WITH IMPUNITY- THIS BILL HELPS TO ADDRESS THAT WE'VE SEEN AT LEAST A SHIFT ON THE CRIMINAL SYSTEM WE SAW WITH THE CONVICTION OF DRUG SHOP IN A FEW WEEKS AGO HAVING SOME LEVEL OF ACCOUNTABILITY. THERE HI THIS BILL ADDRESSES IT IN THE BOOK THE DECERTIFICATION. BOB PERSPECTIVE. IN TERMS OF THE OUTRAGEOUS NO SEVEN OFFICER JUST BEING ABLE TO RESIGN IN THE MIDDLE OF INVESTIGATION GO- WORK FOR ANOTHER AGENCY AND FINALLY SAYING NO THERE'S SOME OFFICERS WHO NEED TO BE CERTIFIED AND SHOULD NEVER WORKERS OFFICERS AGAIN. AND THEN THE PIECE THAT IS UNDER THE JURISDICTION OF THIS COMMITTEE OF CIVIL LIABILITY- AT THE IDEA OF A CALIFORNIA SHOULD HAVE A CIVIL RIGHTS LAW THAT IS ACTUALLY A CIVIL RIGHTS LAW. AND THAT IS NOT A TEST TO BE FRANK HERE THE HOT MESS BUT THE BEING ACT IS IN TERMS OF HOW IT'S DRAFTED AND HOW COURTS HAVE INTERPRETED. BY AND WHAT I LEARNED DURING MY YEARS AND YEARS- LITIGATING SECTION NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE CASES AND BAN ACT CASES. IS IF YOU ARE SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN BADLY HARMED BY A POLICE OFFICER OR THE FAMILY OF SOMEONE WHO'S BEEN KILLED BY A POLICE OFFICER. YOU HAVE IT BUT CHOICE OR YOU CAN DO BOTH BUT THE TWO OPTIONS ARE YOU OF A SECTION FEDERAL SECTION NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE CASE. WHERE YOU HAVE TO OVERCOME THE MOUNT EVEREST OF QUALIFIED IMMUNITY. AND PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO OVERCOME THAT- BUT IT IS EXTREMELY EXTREMELY HARD. OR YOU CAN GO AND PURSUE A BAN ACT- CAUSE OF ACTION WHERE WE DON'T HAVE QUALIFIED IMMUNITY UNDER STATE LAW BUT YOU HAVE THIS. WEIRDLY DRAFTED- STATUTE THAT HAS BEEN INTERPRETED AND BUTCHERED BY THE COURTS OVER THE YEARS. SO IT'S ALMOST HARD TO KNOW HOW YOU'RE EVEN SUPPOSED TO SATISFY THE ELEMENTS OF IT. BECAUSE IT'S SO EXTREME IN TERMS OF THE DRAFTING PARTICULARLY THE INTERPRETATION AND INTERPRETED THE COURT OF APPEALS WHO KNOWS NO OFFENSE TO THE COURT OF APPEAL BUT IT'S THE CURRICULA HOUSING BANGLES THIS SITE YOU MORE AND MORE MORE OVER TIME. TO THE POINT WHERE IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO PLEAD IMPROVE A CAUSE OF ACTION FOR VIOLATION OF THE BAN ACT PARTICULARLY IN THE POLICE. SETTING SO WHAT THE BILL DOES. IS IT SAYS FIRST OF ALL WHATEVER THE INTENTION OF THE LEGISLATURE WAS DECADES AGO THERE THE LEAD WITNESS MADE A REFERENCE TO IT BEING ABOUT HATE CRIMES. THAT'S THAT WHATEVER THE INTENTION WAS DECADES AGO WHEN THE BAND ACT WAS PASSED WE HAVE TO GO WITH WHAT OUR CURRENT ATTENTION AS AND I BELIEVE OUR INTENTION SHOULD BE. FOR CALIFORNIA TO HAVE A STRONG AND VIABLE CIVIL RIGHTS STATUTE SO THAT. PEOPLE WHOSE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS HAVE BEEN VIOLATED INCLUDING BY POLICE OFFICERS WHEN THEY WERE SHOT OR OTHERWISE HARM. HAVE A VIABLE CAUSE OF ACTION AND SO THE JURY CAN MAKE A DECISION WHERE YOUR RIGHTS VIOLATED OVER YOUR OR WAS THE POOL OR WAS THE OFFICER JUSTIFIED. INSTEAD OF HAVING A STRATEGY WHERE YOU CAN'T EVEN GET THAT FAR BECAUSE OF HOW IT'S BEEN INTERPRETED. AND SO S. B. TWO ACTUALLY TO ME SOON SMOOTHS IT OUT MAKES A COMPREHENSIBLE MAKES IT A- STATUE WHERE SOMEONE CAN ACTUALLY HAVE A SHOT A PLEADING AND PROVING. THIS CAUSE OF ACTION- AND THEN I FINALLY WANT ONE AS AN BY TALKING ABOUT. THE IDEA OF SPECIFIC CONTENT BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN THIS. FIGHT IN HONESTY TO. OF COURSE TO MAKE A- EASE. THAT IS EITHER. INTENT TO VIOLATE SOMEONE'S. RIGHTS ARE SO BURKE TO THE- AND I JUST THINK THAT THAT IS A GOOD IDEA- THAT'S NOT WHAT WE DO HAVE UNDER FEDERAL AND THE FEDERAL CIVIL RIGHTS CHARGES UNDER SECTION NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE- AND WE SHOULDN'T GO THAT ROUTE IN PROGRESSIVE- CALIFORNIA. AUG TO PROVE TO HAVE TO PROVE THAT A POLICE OFFICER- SPECIFICALLY HAD A SPECIFIC INTENT. TO VIOLATE YOUR CIVIL IT'S- THAT THAT'S I MEAN YOU CAN LOOK AT A LOT OF. VERY WELL KNOWN CASES INCLUDING. THE MURDER OF GEORGE FLOYD. AND IT WOULD NOT BE IMMEDIATELY APPARENT TO ME. THAT SOMEONE COULD APPROVE IT AND CIVIL COURT. YES IN SPECIFIC CONTENT BECAUSE IT IS SUCH A HIGH STANDARD. AND IT IS SO EASY AS A DEFENDANT. TO ARGUE THAT THE WORLD EVEN IF YOU THINK I MESSED UP EVEN IF YOU THINK I WAS YEAH MAYBE RECKLESS I DID NOT HAVE THE SPECIFIC CONTENT I DID NOT INTEND TO VIOLATE YOUR CIVIL RIGHTS- THAT THAT'S TO ME THAT THAT IS NOT A GOOD PATH. FOR US AND CITING THE WAY THAT THE STATUES DRAFTED NOW IS A MUCH MUCH BETTER APPROACH AND AGAIN THIS IS ABOUT IMIA AND- WHETHER A JURY IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THAT DECISION. DID YOU VIOLATE A PERSON'S RIGHTS THEY DO NOT VIOLATE THE PERSON'S RIGHTS NOW WE KNOW THE INJURIES GO BOTH WAYS ON THESE ISSUES IS NOT A FOREGONE CONCLUSION BUT PEOPLE SHOULD AT LEAST HAVE A DECOR AND SHOULD HAVE A FUNCTIONAL. OPERATIONAL USEFUL CIVIL RIGHTS STATUTE WHICH CALIFORNIA DOES NOT HAVE RIGHT NOW WE SHOUL. AND SAWYER IS AN AYE VOTE IN SB TWO. THANK YOU SIR WIENER AND I KNOW THAT- SENATORS STERN IS RAISED HIS HAND ELECTRONICALLY SENATOR STERN WITH YOUR HAND UP. IT IS SENATOR STERN. I'M HAPPY TO FURTHER OF OTHER MEMBERS YET OTHER MEMBERS IN Q. ALL RIGHT SENATE AND SALAS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- I TO AND 'M SUPPORTIVE OF S. B. TWO AND I WANT TO THANK SENATOR BRADFORD FOR HIS CONTINUED WORK- ON THIS VERY IMPORTANT. VERY IMPORTANT BILL I AM ALSO VERY GLAD TO HEAR OF MANY- LAW ENFORCEMENT THAT IS IN IN FACT- VERY MUCH SUPPORTIVE OF THE DECERTIFICATION PORTION. AND SPEAKING TO THE LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS IN MY BACKYARD AND TALKING TO THEM TODAY AND OVER THE LAST WEEK OR SO I AM VERY GLAD TO HEAR THAT BUT THIS IS NOW A YEAR AFTER. WE HAD THIS INITIAL DISCUSSION SO WHAT THIS BILL DOES IT IT REALLY ASKS US TO DIG DEEPER TO ENSURE THAT THE MOST EGREGIOUS ACTS OF POLICE MAKE MISCONDUCT ARE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. AND I KNOW THAT SENATOR BRADFORD WILL CONTINUE WORKING WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS- IF THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD TODAY- BUT WE HAVE TO GET THERE WE CANNOT SOLELY RELY ON JUST TH DECERTIFICATION PORTION TO GET US TO. A PLACE WHERE OF EQUITY FOR COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN DEEPLY HURT- BUT AGAIN THANKS FOR EVERYONE FOR CALLING IN AND ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS THAT HAVE BEEN ALONGSIDE THE SENATOR DURING THIS PROCESS. ALREADY THANK YOU SENATE GONZALEZ CENTER HERTZBERG. NAME IS GERMAN- YOU KNOW I THINK WHAT SENATOR WIENER SAID WAS EXACTLY CORRECT IN THE SENSE THAT. OFFICERS DOING WHAT THEY WANT TO DO. UNDERMINES CONFIDENCE IN PEOPLE YOU KNOW WHEN YOU TRAVEL THE WORLD AND YOU SEE PEOPLE OF A BADGER UNIFORM AND YOU SEE FOLKS THAT COME TO THIS COUNTRY AND HOW SCARED THEY ARE OF THE POLICE BECAUSE OFTEN THERE ISN'T A RULE OF LAW AND THAT LEVEL OF PROTECTION FOR FOLKS AND I THINK THAT THERE'S A MARRIAGE TO THAT AND I AND I CERTAINLY SUPPORT AS EVERYONE ELSE HAS THE DECERTIFICATION PIECE WHAT CONCERNS ME AND WHAT'S BEEN OCCUPYING MY TIME THE GERMANS TIME TO THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE. IS REALLY THE MAIN ACT CIVIL CODE SECTION FIFTY TWO. IN THE CAR THE POINT THAT SENATOR WIENER ALSO MENTIONED ABOUT BEING THE STATE LAW BEING A HOT MESS HE'S CORRECT- AND BUT THE DIFFERENCE IN WHAT EVERYBODY'S. IT WOULD WHICH GRABS MY ATTENTION HERE. I CERTAINLY NEVER EVER EXPRESSED AND- ANYBODY ELSE IN THIS COMMITTEE WHO EXPRESSED SPECIFIC CONTENT. BECAUSE WHEN I TALK TO THE AUTHOR OF THIS MEASURE HE RAISE THE POINT WHICH I HAVE 1000% AGREE WITH HIM. THE OFFICER WHO KILLED GEORGE FLOYD DID NOT GET UP IN THE MORNING WITH THE INTENT TO KILL GEORGE FLOYD NO QUESTION. ENGAGED IN HORRIBLE RECKLESS BEHAVIOR THAT THE JURY FOUND HIM GUILTY OF. AND SO THE QUESTION BECOMES UNDER VEINS FOR THOSE WHO TRY THESE CASES IN MY OFFICE DID TRY THESE NINE TITLE SIX TOTAL OF FORTY TO NINETEEN FORTY THREE CASES. AND THAT WAY BACK IN THE WAY BACK MACHINE. IS THAT. THE PROBLEM YOU REALLY FACE IN THIS SPACE AND THE REAL ESSENCE TO ME OF WHAT I HAVE CHALLENGES WITH THIS BILL ARE. IS THAT THE FEDERAL COURT ALLOWS YOU TO GET THE WRONGFUL DEATH. BUT NOBODY IN THE IN THE LOWER THE BARS STATE CITY TYLER COMMITTEE LIKES GOING TO THE FEDERAL COURT BECAUSE JUDGES PICK THE JURORS AND YOU HAVE A MUCH BETTER CHANCE IN STATE COURT. SO WHAT THIS BILL DOES IN A VERY SIGNIFICANT WAY IS IT IS IT'S NOT JUST THE STANDARD BY WHICH- WE LOOK AT PROTECTING CIVIL RIGHTS IT'S THE REMEDY. AND THE REMEDY IS THAT IF SOMEONE GETS HURT IT'S ONE THING BUT IF THEY DIDN'T GET A REMEDY IF THEY DIE AND THIS FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGES THE PROCESS. OF HOW. THE BRAIN ACT WORKS BECAUSE IT APPLIES TO WRONGFUL DEATH AND IF YOU TALK TO ANY PRACTICING LAWYER IN THE SPACE OF WHICH I HAVE TALKED AND SPOKE TO A NUMBER IT WITH RESPECT TO PREPARATION FOR TODAY IN ANTICIPATION IN DISCUSSIONS WITH THE AUTHOR. ON THIS THEY WILL TELL YOU. THAT HAVING A WRONGFUL DEATH CLAIM IN THE STATE COURT IS A GIGANTICALLY APPROPRIATE ADVANTAGE. SO THAT BEING SAID THEN YOU LOOK TO THE STANDARD. THE STANDARD HAS BEEN AS WAS EXPRESSED ALL MARKED UP. BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN COURSE CASES THAT SAID WELL WHEN YOU SAY RECKLESS IT REALLY MEANS INTENTIONAL. AND IN THE BILL IF YOU LOOK AT PAGE SEVEN OF THE MEASURE. AND I WAS TALKING TO SOME OF THE ADVOCATES ON THIS. THE SECOND PAGE THE PARAGRAPH TO SECTION A LINE EIGHTEEN TO THIRTY TWO. THE THREATS INTIMIDATION OR COERCION RECORD OF THE SECTION. THAT'S WHETHER YOU'RE HANDCUFFED OR SOMEONE DRAWS A GUN OR WHATEVER THE CASE MAY BE. IT HAS IN MY JUDGMENT CONFUSING LANGUAGE AT THE ONE HAND IT SAYS FOR PURPOSES OF THIS SECTION A PERSON ACTION POTENTIALLY WHEN THE PERSON ACTUALLY GENERAL INTENT. A COUPLE OF LINES ABOVE IT TALKS ABOUT DELIBERATE INDIFFERENCE OR RECKLESS DISREGARD. WHAT IS IT. I'M TELLING YOU THAT YOU KNOW IN THESE DISCUSSIONS I'VE HAD WITH A LOT OF VERY BRIGHT FOLKS. ON ALL SIDES- I THINK THAT THAT THE UNDERLYING ISSUE HERE I DON'T THINK ANYBODY OBJECTS THAT WE AT LEAST ANYBODY I'VE SPOKEN TO WHO ARE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE. OR THIS LEGISLATURE TO A NEW STANDARD THAT'S NECESSARY BECAUSE OF WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON IN A HORRIBLY INAPPROPRIATE WAY. AND THE QUESTION IS WHAT'S THE REMEDY AND ARE YOU GOING TO ARE YOU GOING TO SAY WELL WORK IN THIS GONNA TAKE THIS CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT WE'RE GOING TO DRAMATICALLY CHANGE THE REMEDY. BUT NOT LOOK AT THE STANDARD ESPECIALLY WHEN THE STAIRS SCREWED UP NOW THIS MORNING I WAS ON THE CALL. VERY PRODUCTIVE CALL WITH SOME OF THE ADVOCATES IN THIS MEASURE WHICH THEY'D OFFERED A SERIES OF AMENDMENTS- WITH THERE'S BEEN DISCUSSIONS OF AMENDMENTS DEALING WITH THE IDEA OF RECKLESS AND- WHICH I WHICH I SUPPORT. RECKLESS INDIFFERENCE OR WRECKED I MEAN DELIBERATE INDIFFERENCE OR RECKLESS DISREGARD. YOU KNOW MEANING IF YOU PULL THE GUN OUT AND YOU MADE A MISTAKE BECAUSE YOU THOUGHT YOU WERE PULLING OUT A TASER HE PULLED A GUN. SIGNIFICANT SET OF FACTS THAT ARE DIFFERENT. ON AN EDIT REQUIRES GIVEN THE FACT THAT THE LAWS SO MARKED UP AND GIVEN WHAT'S BEEN MADE CLEAR TO ME PARTICULARLY BY SOME OF THE ADVOCATES IN THE SPACE THAT PERSUADED ME. A ON ON THE SIDE OF SUPPORTING THE BILL. IS THAT IS THAT THE LAW REALLY IS MARKED UP AND THAT MAYBE WE SHOULD LOOK AT THE FEDERAL LAW TITLE FORTY TWO NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE. BUT THAT'S THE THAT AND APPLY THOSE STANDARDS BECAUSE THEY HAVE A BETTER BODY OF CASE SUPPORTING ONE OF THE THINGS ALL THE LAWYERS TALKED ABOUT IT TALK TO THE LAWYER. TODAY WHO HAND WHO'S HANDLING THE TO HANDLE THE- A CORNELL OVER SAN FRANCISCO CASE- AND THE QUESTION BECOMES. RIGHT DO WE CALIFORNIA LAW THE CASE IS ALREADY SO MESSED UP WE INITIALLY TALKED ABOUT ELIMINATING THAT CASE ABROGATING THE CASE BUT IT CREATES PROBLEMS. AND SO IF YOU GET INTO THE DETAILS YOU KNOW I WAS LIKE TO SAY WHAT MAKES VAN ROAD GREAT THE ILLINOIS CHICAGO ARCHITECT THAT. GOD IS IN THE DETAILS NOT LEVEL TO DETAILS IN THE D. GOT OF THE G. TWO. WITH THE HOW MANY PAGE HERE- THIRTY SIX PAGE MAY WITH A LOT OF PARAGRAPHS AND I ONLY BEEN FOCUSED ON THIS ONE ISSUE RELATING TO. THE STANDARD OF IF WE'RE GONNA APPLY. ON THE BETA ACT TWO WRONGFUL. DEATH WITH THE CONSEQUENCES ARE SIGNIFICANT THE DAMAGES TO CITIES AND COUNTIES SIGNIFICANT. THERE'S NO ISSUES ABOUT TRANSPARENCY ALL THE OTHER ISSUES THAT RELATE TO LAW ENFORCEMENT WHICH THERE ARE PUBLISHED BY THIS WHICH I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH. BUT HOW DO WE GET TO THAT POINT SO THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT THE ONE OF THE SUGGESTIONS THAT I HAD IS MADE WE JUST PUT THIS BILL OVER. AND THEN WE TAKE THE TIME TO. TO CONTINUE THIS AND IF WE HAVE TO SET A SPECIAL HEARING GIVEN THE CHALLENGES MAYBE THAT'S THE SOLUTION THAT WASN'T REALLY. SUGGESTS IT WAS IT WAS A PEOPLE ARE EXCITED ABOUT THAT BUT I DO THINK THAT IN THIS COMMITTEE THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE OF THE CALIFORNIA SENATE WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO GET IT RIGHT. I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT INDEMNITY- MUNITY I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT THE ISSUES WITH RESPECT TO THE- YOU KNOW THE OTHER ISSUES OKAY IN THIS CASE THE CERTIFICATION ISSUES. I'M JUST REALLY WEIRD ABOUT THIS LIABILITY ISSUE AND GETTING THE STANDARD RIGHT AND THERE'S SOME CONCERN AMONG ALL PARTIES THAT IF WE ADOPT THE STATE STANDARD WE CREATE A NEW STANDARD. WE CREATE A WHOLE NEW STORIES SIZES AND RULE OF LAW WHICH CONCERNS ME. I'M NOT LEARN ENOUGH TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE CASE IS ALREADY HAS BEEN UNDER TITLE FORTY TO NINETEEN FORTY THREE OF THE FEDERAL LAW SO YOU KNOW MY VIEW ON THIS IS. IS THAT THIS STILL NEEDS WORK. ON ALTHOUGH THE ON IT. IS RIGHT. AND I'M ACTUALLY CONVINCED IN THE GOOD FAITH IS THE ADVOCATES WITH WHOM I'VE SPOKEN WITH. WHO ARE THE SPONSORS OF THIS BILL TOGETHER WITH THE AUTHOR. THAT WITH A LITTLE BIT MORE HOMEWORK OF THIS COMMITTEE WE CAN GET THERE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU CENTER HERTZBERG CENTERS STERN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN COMING THROUGH OKAY. YES YOU ARE. OKAY IT JUST GIVEN BALLING RIGHT- WHO. ARE YOU SURE DO YOU MEMBERS FOR IT EXCELLENT THE- COLLOQUY THIS FOR. PUTTING SOME FURTHER CLARITY ON THESE ISSUES- TO BE CLEAR TO THE AUTHOR- THIS IS THE YEAR WE HAVE TO GET. THESE REFORMS DONE- I BELIEVE THIS IS THE BILL M. BELIEVE YOU'RE THE AUTHOR TO DO THAT- YOU FORCED ALL OF US TO LOOK OURSELVES IN THE MIRROR. AND RECOGNIZE THAT. WALKING AROUND WITH- ONE SET OF SKIN IS VERY DIFFERENT THAN WALKING IN A VERY AND- IN A BODY OF DIFFERENT COLOR SKIN. AND THE NOT JUST THE- POLICY EXPERIENCE DRIVING THIS BILL BUT THE- THE LIFE EXPERIENCE DRIVING THIS AND ALL THE INCIDENTS. THAT MAY NOT EVEN BE QUOTE QUALIFIED IN THIS LEGISLATION- THAT WILL AFFECT. ARE PEOPLE OF COLOR LIVING IN CALIFORNIA RIGHT NOW ON THE STREETS REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY'RE EVEN CAUGHT UP IN ONE OF THESE TERRIBLE INCIDENTS OR NOT. THERE'S A BROADER CULTURE OF FEAR THAT WE BUILD- ADDED THAT- COLLECT FROM STATE GOVERNMENT AND FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT STEPPING UP TO ACTUALLY HOLD. OUR OWN OFFICERS ACCOUNTABLE- IN THESE NEEDS SERIOUS CASES OF MISCONDUCT SO I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR INSISTING ON. COMING BACK AGAIN ANDBRINGING SOMETHING REALLY STRONG TO THIS COMMITTEE- A- MY I GUESS MY QUESTIONS ARE. ABOUT THIS SPECIFIC- THE DEBATE WE'RE HAVING I GUESS RIGHT NOW I'M READING UP IN THE ANALYSIS OF THIS DEBATE ABOUT SPECIFIC VERSES GENERAL INTENDS. AND I'M HOPING TO GET SOME CLARITY AND I DON'T KNOW WHETHER IT'S FROM- THE EXPERT WITNESS- THE ATTORNEY OR THE AUTHOR OR MAYBE IN THE CLOTHES OR WHATEVER IS APPROPRIATE BUT- ADAM WHAT WHAT SPECIFICALLY. DIDN'T WORK ABOUT THE VARIOUS STANDARDS THAT HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED BACK AND FORTH IT SEEMS LIKE THERE'S A LOT OF VARIATIONS BETWEEN FULL GENERAL INTENDS AND WHAT WHAT FOLKS ARE CALLING SPECIFIC INTENT WHICH IS YOU KNOW COULD BE CHARACTERIZED AS AN OFFICER DELIBERATELY INTENDING TO VIOLATE SOMEBODY CIVIL RIGHTS OR COULD BE RECKLESS INDIFFERENCE TO THOSE RIGHTS OR COULD JUST BE SIMPLY. IGNORING YOU KNOW KNOWING CIRCUMSTANCES ARE- MAKING IT SAY- ARREST- THAT WAS THE WRONG SUSPECT- BUT USING SOMETHING LIKE RACES THE QUALIFIER WHICH WE KNOW MANY PEOPLE TO GO THROUGH- THOSE KINDS OF STOPS ARRESTS SEARCHES. THE QUESTION TO ME IS IT JUST JUST TO GET INTO SPECIFICS A LITTLE BIT HERE AND TRY TO UNDERSTAND A LITTLE BETTER. WHAT IT HOW EXACTLY WOULD. WHAT WHAT KIND OF CONDUCT WOULD ACTUALLY MEET THE STANDARD IN THIS BILL BECAUSE I'M I'M STILL KIND OF CONFUSED BY THE DEBATE AND BY. THEN ALICE'S. ENDS IS THERE ANY AND WHETHER THERE'S A CONCERN ABOUT THE EVIDENTIARY STANDARD FOR EXAMPLE THAT WOULD BE REQUIRED- TO BE PRESENTED- IN THESE CASES OF SAY DELIBERATE INDIFFERENCE OR RECKLESS DISREGARD. IF IT'S REALLY BAD EVIDENCE- AND CONCERNED ABOUT NOT HAVING SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE OR IF IT'S MORE- ABOUT THE DETERRENCE AFFECTED THAT YOU MAY BE HOPING FOR THIS TO HAVE SAY. YOU KNOW IF- ALL OUR COUNTIES AND CITIES AND EVEN THE STATE ARE GONNA BE LIABLE FOR- THAT CONTACTED YOU KNOW EAT. A WIDER MUCH MUCH WIDER RANGE OF CONDUCT MAYBE TELADOC DIFFERENT POLICIES AND THEN. IN EFFECT BATTLE TO TURN THE CONTRACTORS IS REALLY ABOUT WINNING BIG CLAIMS AND REALLY PURSUING THE CIVIL PENALTIES IN THE MONETARY SIDE OF THIS THING WHICH- I DON'T WANT TO- UNDER CUT IN ANY WAY THE IMPORTANCE OF. OF BOTH THAT IS A DETERRENCE MECHANISM BUT REALLY ALSO IS. YOU KNOW IS IT IS A STANDARD FOR- FOR GETTING SOME KIND OF JUSTICE ALTHOUGH IT NEVER GETS- YOU KNOW NO MATTER HOW MUCH MONEY. MS BERING WHO TESTIFIED WON'T WON'T GET HER SON BACK- ENDS. YOU KNOW KENNETH KENNETH ROSS THE THIRD WILL GET THAT BACK IN- SO MANY OTHER EXAMPLES AND WITH ALL DUE RESPECT BY THE WAY TO THE LEAD OPPOSITION WITNESS YOU KNOW THE- TO SUGGEST THAT THE TO BARIS CASE IS GOING TO BE SUFFICIENT IN THAT WE CAN USE SIMPLY A NEGLIGENCE STANDARD. TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES THAT I THINK MISSES THE POINT SOMEONE- BECAUSE THAT CASE ALSO AT THE CENTRE WINNERS POINT STRUCK DOWN THE MAIN ACT VIOLATION IT DISMISSED THAT AND IT'S A MARS FAMILY- JONES WIDOW IN THEIR FAMILY HAD NO NO RECOURSE UNDER ME. NOW IN THAT CASE THERE'S A MENTAL HEALTH INCIDENT. AND THE OFFICER DIDN'T PAY ATTENTION TO THE AT SO THE SITUATION WASN'T CALLED TO THE SCENE BECAUSE OF ANY CONFLAGRATION OR ANY ISSUE AND JUST ACTED INDEPENDENTLY. AND IN SEVEN GUNSHOTS- AT A FIFTEEN FOOT DISTANCE AND EVEN THOUGH THEY FOUND THAT ACTION TO BE A JURY WOULD RECENTLY FIND THAT THAT KIND OF NEGLIGENT BIG STILL COULDN'T FIND A BANE ACT. VIOLATION THAT TO ME IS A PROP I DO WE HAVE TO SOLVE THAT IN HIS LEGISLATION HERE TODAY I JUST I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE GET THERE- AND SO PROVIDING SOME CLARITY ABOUT EXACTLY WHAT KIND OF EVIDENCE YOU HAVE TO BRING UNDER THE CURRENT STANDARDS VERSES SOME OF THE OTHER VARIATIONS WITHIN THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE. I WOULD REALLY HELP BUT I THINK I THINK OUT OF THIS HOPEFULLY OUT OF HIS HEARING IT OUT OF THE SESSION WE CAN FORM A MUCH BIGGER CONSENSUS AND YOU KNOW GETTING RID OF QUALIFIED IMMUNITY HERE TODAY AND GETTING WRONGFUL DEATH ON THE BOOKS AND SOME STANDARD IT'S ACTUALLY GONNA WORK TO GET US TO BE ENACT VIOLATIONS. I THINK WOULD BE A MASSIVE STEP FORWARD FOR THE CIVIL RIGHTS OF ALL CALIFORNIANS- SO ANYHOW I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE. APPROPRIATE TIME IS MISTER CHAIR TO ANSWER THIS QUESTIONS BUT- I WOULD. SOME IT'S- THANK YOU SENATOR INCIDENT DODD YOU CAN ADDRESS THAT ISSUE WHEN YOU'RE I WILL ALLOW OUR LEADER WITNESS- TO RESPOND TO THE SPECIFIC ACTS THAT ARE SENATOR FROM. MALIBU INQUIRED ABOUT AND I WILL TRY TO ENCAPSULATE HIS OTHER CONCERNS IN MY CLOTHES ALL RIGHT THANK YOU SIR BRADFORD MISS YOU ARE YOU AVAILABLE ON THE PHONE. BONTA MODERATORS MISUSE. THANK YOU SO MUCH BETTER I WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE ISSUES AND SENATOR LEADERS THAT WERE IN A HOT MESS. BUT THE GOOD NEWS I FRONT OF THE PACIFIC IMPACT. IS REALLY ONLY STARTED IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN. PEOPLE WERE NOW KATE BAD SUPER IMPORTANT PACIFIC IMPACT FOR THIRTY YEARS OF THAT BEING HACKED WE DID NOT HAD ANY PROBLEM FIGURING OUT WHAT I PROVIDE WHAT MEN DO WAY OUT OF MY TO WHAT CONSTITUTIONAL. VIOLATION THE PROBLEM THE LAND THAT WERE HAVING NOW IS THAT WE ALL HAVE A- THAT. IMPRENTA IS NOT REQUIRED IT SHOULD NOT BE WEEK. AND WE SHOULD GET OF IT I THINK THERE IS A CONSENSUS THAT FROM THAT WHAT'S WRONG IN A THREE. IT IN. WITH THE SPIRIT OF. NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE. WHAT WINDOW IS THAT WE HAVE REPLACED THE TYPICAL PASS WITH RECKLESS NAY WHICH HAD ALL DEFINITIONS ONE WAGE IN CORNELL IT THAT THE PICK AND PACK. WE ARE GETTING READY AND THEN INVITE YET RIGHT BACK I'M NOT A DIFFICULTY WITH NEW THAT BLACK YEAH. BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY. I WE DIDN'T DISCUSS THAT- AT SOME OF THAT COMIC BY SENATE. SO. LET ME GIVE YOU A EXAMPLE FOR A BI RECENT OF THE UNLESS. THE WEEKLY. NEED THAT BIG. BOB UNREASONABLE. DONE WITH THE OBJECT EIGHT AND NOT CONTACT WE CAN'T MEAN I INTENDED BUY A NEW ON NECK. AND DOING SO WHY OBJECT AND WE- IN THE COUNTRY OFFICER WOULD NOT. HE'S ON SOMEBODY THAT FOR NINE MINUTES THAT IT TO PROVE EIGHT WE SAID YOU TO SHOW RIGHT THAT IN A BAG. THANK WHICH MEANS THE OPPOSITE BAG I BET VICTIMS TO SHOW THE OFFICE IN HAND TO BUY SOMEBODY. RIGHT BY THE THEIR ON BOARD THAT CREDIT ALL YES AND IS SOMETHING THAT CONSTITUTIONAL CONSTITUTION NO WEEK. READING WE'RE DO WE DO AT THE CHIU. EIGHT TAKING A BIT BACK TO HELP YOU WHY. BEFORE FOR NOW IN. TWO THOUSAND. CLAIM UNDER THE BILL'S STANDARD VERSUS- SOME STANDARD IT DIDN'T JUST ALLOW GENERALLY TEND SO WHAT LIKE. SPEC A HYPOTHETICAL OR SOME YOU KNOW CITY SOME SOME A LITTLE MORE SPECIFICITY ON WHAT WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE IN THE EVIDENTIARY JONES AT THIS IS YOUR CLASS SENATOR DO YOU NEED ME THE STAND APPROPRIATE ABOUT. BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT CLEAR CONVINCING. LANGUAGE I THINK THE QUOTED LANGUAGE IS THE- WOULD HAVE TO PROVE THAT THE ACTED WITH THE CONSTANT OBJECTIVE TO ENGAGE IN CONDUCT. THAT INTERFERES OR TAKEN TODAY WITH THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT SO. WHAT'S THAT WHAT'S THAT CONDUCT LIKE HOW BROAD IS THAT THE LESSER STANDARD O REVIEW MORE SO THE SHOWING. GET ACTUALLY GET DISCOUNTED SCORE ALL RIGHT THANK YOU SIR SIR LET ME DIRECT IT TO THE CENTER PRESS CENTER BRADFORD YOU WANT TO TAKE BACK OR DO WOULD YOU PREFER TO HAVE MISS YOU TAKE THAT. OR NOT YOU HAVE THAT BECAUSE I THINK IT'S CLEARLY SPELLED OUT IN THE BILL WITH THOSE OF IT INTRIGUED- THOSE CONFLICTS ARE WHICH LEADS TO- A- DEFINING WHAT'S MISCONDUCT OR INTENTIONAL. OKAY OUR ACTION I SHOULD SAY HI THANK YOU TANK SENATE. REFERENCE YOU DID YOU WANT TO ADD ON TO THAT. AT THE- OF THE MONTH ISSUE. GENERAL INTACT ONLY GETS THE FIRST STEP OF A CON VIOLATE ONE IS THAT YOU HAVE TO ACT DILIGENTLY MEANING WE CANNOT. I INTENDED TISSUE THAT TIME. THAT GENERAL IN. IN GAME IN A- CON BUT THAT COULD NOT MOVE UP CONSTITUTIONAL VIOLATION YOU CAN ONLY DO SO. BY IN ADDITION TO BEING FAT FIND OUT WHAT OBJECTIVELY UNREASONABLE OF COURSE UNDER THE OTHER CONSTITUTIONAL CLAIMS THIS STANDARD IS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT SO UNDER THE- FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT YOU HAVE OBJECTIVELY UNREASONABLE. STANDARD INSTEAD OF. OTHERS YEAH- EIGHT THEM. SO THE WEIGHT THAT THE PORT CABS AT ANALYZE ALL OF THAT DEBATE GENERAL IN TIME MEANING THAT YOU INTENTIONALLY AND VOLITIONAL ENGAGED IN A PARTICULAR CONTACT. AND IN ADDITION TO THAT YOU VIOLATED THE CONSTITUTION ALL OF THE STANDARDS THAT ARE SEPARATE DEPENDING ON THE. STATUS OF THE DESKTOP. NINETY THANK YOU MISS YOU PRESIDENT. THANK VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR I JUST WANTED TO- MAKE MY COMMENTS PROBABLY WOULD HAVE BEEN REAL APPROPRIATE RIGHT AFTER- SENATOR- FROM LA. I WANTED TO BASICALLY SAY THAT I DON'T HAVE ANY PROBLEM WITH THE WHOLE ISSUE OF IMMUNITY OR THE ISSUE OF DECERTIFICATION- AND ALL THE LICENSING I THINK NEEDS WORK A LOT OF WORK THIS COMMITTEE DOESN'T HAVE JURISDICTION OVER THE LICENSING BUT- BUT IN REGARDS TO. THE- THE LIABILITY ISSUES I HAVE SOME CONCERN AND I WANTED TO BASICALLY SAY THAT I THINK WE NEED TO TAKE THE TIME- I THINK SENATOR BRADFORD HAS DONE A TREMENDOUS JOB- IN BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD BUT I THINK IT NEEDS SOME WORK AND IT'S RARE. BUT JUST SAY IT IT'S VERY RARE. TO INTRODUCE A BILL AND NOT HAVE ANY AMENDMENTS AT ALL. THE CLARIFY AND TO- MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE PICKING THE RIGHT STANDARDS AND THAT IT MAKES SENSE AND THAT THERE'S NO CONFUSION BASED ON ON THE LANGUAGE THAT WE'VE USED AND- I HAVE SOME REAL ISSUES WITH SOME OF THE LANGUAGE WILL GO INTO THEM HERE I THINK. YOU KNOW WE CAN TALK ABOUT THIS ALL DAY BUT I JUST THINK WE SHOULD TAKE THE TIME AND I THINK IT'S LEADERSHIP. AND LEADERSHIP IS INVOLVED IN THIS BILL WE CAN WAIVE THE RULES. THAT ARE IN PLACE AND THERE'S NOTHING THAT JUST DRIVING US TO DO SOMETHING. TO PASS SOMETHING RIGHT NOW THAT ISN'T IN THE SHAPE IT NEEDS TO BE SO I WOULD. I WOULD RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THAT WE CONSIDER TAKING THE TIME WE NEED TO GET THIS RIGHT. I GUESS ON THE COPIER I DO NOT SEE ANY OTHER MICROPHONES REYES- CENTER BRADFORD A COUPLE POINTS HERE. FIRST OF ALLTHIS IS MEANINGFUL REFORM- THIS IS PROBABLY THE MOST MEANINGFUL REFORM WITH RESPECT TO CIVIL JUSTICE AND POLICING. CERTAINLY IN IN MY CAREER- WE AGREE ON THE GOALS ACCOUNTABILITY. ABSOLUTELY DO WE NEED GREATER ACCOUNTABILITY ABSOLUTELY THE DECERTIFICATION PROCESS PROVIDES THAT TRADITIONAL ACCOUNTABILITY AND WE SHOULD MOST DEFINITELY WITHIN THE SESSION. ENACT LEGISLATION THAT PROVIDES A MECHANISM PROCESS. FOR DECERTIFICATION. WRONGFUL DEATH IT IS SOMEWHAT EMBARRASSING. THAT SOMEONE DOESN'T HAVE RECOURSE IN A WRONGFUL DEATH ACTION WHEN THERE'S BEEN A POLICE OFFICER WHO'S COMMITTED BASICALLY A WRONGFUL DEATH IN THIS BILL DOESN'T THIS BILL ALLOWS SAID THE SAME THING WITH MUNICH FOLKS HAVE TALKED ABOUT QUALIFIED IMMUNITY THIS BILL REMOVES THE STATE IMMUNITIES THAT IS HUGE. THAT IS HUGE- S. WAS RAISED BY SEVERAL FOLKS. THAT WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION HERE BESIDES EFFECTING POLICY BUT pOBLIGATION MAKE SURE WHEN THIS LAW IS APPLIED THAT IT'S CLEAR I ASSOCIATE MYSELF WITH THE COMMENTS OF SENATOR WIENER FROM SAN FRANCISCO. THE MAIN ACT IS A HOT MESS I LOOKED AT THE JURY INSTRUCTION YOU PROBABLY FILE THE JURY INSTRUCTION THE BANE ACT IS A HOT MESS IS THAT EXIST TODAY. AND OUR JOB IS TO MAKE SURE THAT IT DOESN'T EMERGE FROM THIS COMMITTEE. CONFUSING AND THAT'S WHY WE'VE GONE BACK AND FORTH ON SOME OF THE ISSUES. THE MEN'S RAY OF THE SPECIFIC CONTENT VERSUS GENERAL INTENT VERSUS THE LEVELS OF CULPABILITY DOES NEED TO BE DEFINED WE NEEDED TO FIND. NOT I NOR I THINK ANYBODY ELSE WANTS TO SEE A SPECIFIC INTENT STANDARD THAT EXIST TODAY. WE DON'T WANT TO SEE A STANDARD WHERE SOMEONE HASTO PROVE THE SPECIFIC INTENT TO KILL. SENATOR BRADFORD PROVIDED SEVERAL EXAMPLES TO ME WHERE FOR EXAMPLE IN OFFICER PUNCHES A WOMAN THE FACE AND PERHAPS SHE DIES. THAT'S AT LEAST RECKLESS CONDUCT I THINK IT'S INTENTIONAL CONDUCT BUT IT'S AT LEAST RECKLESS CONDUCT AND SPECIFIC INTENT. SHOULD NOT HAPPY PROVED IN THAT CIRCUMSTANCE- CELEBRATE FOR JUST A POINT. ABOUT THIS BILL I SERVE WITH TOM BEING TOM BEING WOULD BE HORRIFIED AS TO WHAT'S HAPPENED TO HIS LAW. RIDLEY WRITTEN AS A HATE CRIME LAW BUT WHAT HE WOULD BE HIS BE PROUD OF YOU. THE PROUD OF THE DEDICATION AND THE PASSION YOU BROUGHT TO THIS ISSUE. SO YOU CAN CLOSE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND LET ME START MICHAEL'S BY THINKING YOU. EIGHTEEN MY SENATOR FROM LOS ANGELES FOR THE TIME THAT YOU HAVE TRULY WORK AT TRYING TO GET THIS RIGHT AND TO ALL MY THE COLLEAGUES OF THIS MAN- COMMITTEE WHO HAVE MET WITH ME. ONE ON ONE SIDE BARS TO DISCUSS YOUR CONCERNS YOUR INTEREST IN YOUR SUPPORT. OF THIS MEASURE. THIS IS A TOUGH ISSUE. BUT IT'S A RIGHT TO SISTER. AND IT'S A ISSUE THAT GIVES WHAT ONE FOR SPRINT WANTS TO BE ON THEIR SIDE. INTENTIONALITY AND WE WANT TO BE INTENTIONAL ABOUT WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE IN CALIFORNIA WHEN IT COMES TO POLICE REFORM IN THIS IS WHAT THIS BILL DOES IT'S VERY INTENTIONAL IN SPELLING OUT WHAT IT IS THAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE. WE MIGHT BAKER ABOUT THE SEMANTICS. I'M NOT A LAWYER. NOR DO I PLAY ONE ON TV. BUT I'VE TRUSTED AND TALKED TO MANY. IN THIS PROFESSION WHO BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A FAIR. OUR MEASURE AND FAR BETTER THAN ANYTHING THAT EXISTS TODAY. LET ME ADDRESS MY CONCERNS FROM MY FRIEND FROM THE CENTRAL VALLEY A COLLEAGUE THAT I ESPECT TREMENDOUSLY BUT THIS IS NOT A RUSH TO MEASURE THIS MEASURE WAS INTRODUCED LAST YEAR WE HAD A YEAR TO WORK ON THIS MEASURE. SO BY NO MEANS HAS THIS BEEN RUSHED AND IN MY TEN YEARS HERE IN THIS LEGISLATURE AND MY TWENTY TWO YEARS AS AN ELECTED OFFICIAL THERE'S NOT BEEN ONE ISSUE THAT I HAD DEDICATED MORE TIME TO GETTING RIGHT THEN THIS ISSUE RIGHT HERE TODAY SO I SAY. HOW MUCH LONGER. THE QUESTION HOW MANY MORE LIVES NEED TO BE LOST. THE RECKLESSNESS TO INTENTIONAL ACTIONS BY LAW ENFORCEMENT HOW MANY MORE PEOPLE REGARDLESS OF COLOR NEED TO LOSE THEIR LIVES BECAUSE OF THE CALLOUS ACTS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. TO MY FRIEND FROM FRESNO WHO ASKED THE QUESTION ABOUT THE ADVISORY BOARD DEVICE REPORT IS JUST THAT AN ADVISORY BOARD IT HAS NO HIERARCHY OVER POST COMMISSION THERE ARE SUGGESTED THEY PROVIDE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT POLLS CAN TRULY OVERALL IT'S AN ADVISORY BOARD. BUT IT RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT THE COMPOSITION OF THE QUALIFICATIONS OF THESE INDIVIDUALS. IT'S MEMBERS IN THIS LEGISLATURE WHO DECIDE ON ISSUES THAT THEY HAVE NO IDEAL ABOUT HOW IT WORKS IN REAL LIFE. BUT WE ENTRUST THE BORDERS OF CALIFORNIA THE TRUST US TO DEAL WITH A MYRIAD OF ISSUES. AND WE TRY TO GET HIM RIGHT. WE TRUST TWELVE MEMBERS IN A BOX. TO DETERMINE ONE'S LIFE OR DEATH SITUATION EVERY DAY IN A JURY TRIAL NOBODY ASKED ABOUT THEIR QUALIFICATIONS SO TO SAY THAT. ONLY LAW ENFORCEMENT CAN POLICE THE POLICE THAT IS WHAT LED US HERE TODAY AND THAT'S WHY WE'VE GOT AHUNDRED AND TWENTY YEARS OF WHAT WE'VE DONE. AS OF ONE GUY WANTS IT WE KEEP DOING WHAT WE DO WHEN WE GOT BIG KEEP GETTING WHAT WE GET. AND THAT'S NOTHING. THIS IS GOOD POLICY. AND IT'S TIME FOR CALIFORNIA IT'S TIME FOR US AS LEGISLATORS TO LOOK OURSELVES IN THE MIRROR AND I APPRECIATE. MY COLLEAGUES FROM MALIBU. WHO SAID THIS TIME LOOK OURSELVES IN AMERICA AND UNDERSTAND THEIR TO. SYSTEMS OF JUSTICE IN THIS COUNTRY. IT'S TWO SYSTEMS BUT YOU'LL NEVER KNOW UNTIL YOU WALK A DAY IN MY FERRAGAMO'S. REALLY UNDERSTAND IT'S FAR DIFFERENT THAN ANYTHING ANY OF YOU GUYS HAVE EVER ENCOUNTERED OR WILL ENCOUNTER. AND ALL WE'RE ASKING FOR IS A OPPORTUNITY TO NOT ONLY SAVE LIVES BUT FOR THOSE WHO ARE LOST THE GET JUSTICE TO GET ACCOUNTABILITY THE GET SOME SENSE OF FAIRNESS. THIS IS NOT A PERFECT BILL. BUT WE WOULD ALL AGREE THERE'S NO SUCH PERFECT BILL. BUT IT'S BETTER THAN WHAT WE HAVE AND IT SURELY BEAT NOTHING. IT IS BEEN WELL THE BRAIDED. BUT WE SHOULDN'T STAND HERE TODAY LED. THE PERFECT BE THE ENEMY OF THE GOOD. WE SHOULD WE SHOULD TAKE BOLD AND DECISIVE ACTIONS WE SHOULD TAKE FAIR ACTIONS AND LET ME THINK THOSE INDIVIDUALS ON LAW ENFORCEMENT I APPLAUD YOU FOR SUPPORTING THE CERTIFICATION BECAUSE THE SAME AGENCIES THAT SUPPORTED TODAY BEEN SUPPORTED LAST YEAR SO WHAT A DIFFERENCE A YEAR MAKES. WHAT A DIFFERENCE A YEAR MAKES THOSE SAME AGENCIES WORK ADAMANTLY OPPOSED WHEN IT SIMPLY WAS A DE SER BILL BUT NOW WE HAD BRAIN ACT IN ALL I SUPPORT THE SEARCH I JUST DON'T LIKE THE BANNER. WE SHOULD BE PROTECTING PEOPLE'S CIVIL RIGHTS AS WELL. WE SHOULD AFFORD THEM TO FIND JUSTICE NOT. BEING MADE WHOLE BECAUSE NOTHING'S GOING TO MAKE THE FLOYD FAMILY HOLD THESE L. FORD FAMILY HOLD THE TO MERE RICE FAMILY WHOLE DODGERS GUARDADO FAMILY THE RYAN ROSS FAMILY HOME WE CAN GO ON AND ON AND ALL IS NOTHING THIS IS NOT ABOUT. FINANCIAL JUDGMENT BECAUSE AFTER FLOYD FAMILY AT TWENTY SEVEN MILLION IS NOT GONNA BRING GEORGE FLOYD BACK. BUT WE NEED A SENSE OF ACCOUNTABILITY WE NEED SOME RESPONSIBILITY AT ALL THIS BILL DOES WITH THE BRAIN ACT IF PUT SOME SKIN IN THE GAME BECAUSE WE ALL KNOW. IT WERE HELD CIVIL CIVIL CYBELE LIABLE WE'RE GOING TO CHANGE OUR BEHAVIOR IT'S ANOTHER GUARD RAIL TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN HOLD. IN CHANGED BEHAVIOR. WE DON'T HAVE A POLICING PROBLEM IN AMERICA. BECAUSE IT WORKS AND WHY COMMUNITIES IT WORKS QUITE WELL THE WAY IT SHOULD. WE GOT A TRUST PROBLEM. WE GOT A FEAR FACTOR. BLACK AND BROWN PEOPLE DO NOT HATE THE POLICE THEY FEARED A POLICE AND WHERE THERE'S FEAR THERE WOULD NEVER BE TRUST THIS BILL ALLOWS US TO ESTABLISH A LEVEL OF TRUST. AND I REMAKE OMITTED AS I STATED THE WORKING WITH EACH AND EVERYONE OF YOU HERE. BUT I ALSO REMAIN COMMITTED TO PASSING A BILL. THAT ARE ADVOCATES CAN FULLY SUPPORT. AND WON'T BE A REFLECTION OF THE STATUS QUO WE'VE SEEN THAT TOO MANY TIMES THE WASHINGTON REPEAT. ARE YOU TO LOOK AT OUR COMMITMENTS AS I STATED WE OFFERED UP THREE VERSION. AND HERE ARE SUPPORTERS AND WORK WITH US FOR MEANING FULL. REFORM AND SOLUTIONS FOR POLICING HERE IN CALIFORNIA. MEMBERS WE HAVE OPPORTUNITY TODAY THE BE ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF HISTORY.

SHE IS A TAX ATTORNEY SHE IS AN ADJUNCT PROFESSOR AT ONE OF OUR LOCAL COLLEGES. AND IS IN THE FORTY WITH TWENTY YEARS WORTH OF EXPERIENCE AND COMPLIANCE MATTERS IN THE FINANCIAL INDUSTRY. SO WE WERE- THAT. VERY FORTUNATE TO HAVE HER PUT THE PUT SB THREE NINE TWO IN THE CONTEXT OF THE STATE AND FEDERAL PRIVACY LAWS AND I DO WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT. BECAUSE OF THE ASIAN ALREADY HAVE THE AUTHORITY AND THE POWER TO BE ABLE TO DELIVER DOCUMENTS BY EMAIL THE CRITICAL POINT IS THAT THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO OBTAIN THE CONSENT OF THE OWNER OF THE ADDRESS BEFORE DELIVERING DOCUMENTS. SO WE WANT TO STRESS THAT POINT AND THEN MISLED LOW PLANTERS ALREADY SAID THERE ARE ALSO DISCLOSED DISCLOSURE ISSUES WITH THIS BILL. THERE IS NO INDICATION OF EXACTLY WHAT INFORMATION IS GOING TO BE COLLECTED AND HOW IT IS GOING TO BE USED.

CABALLERO HI I HAVE A AT ALL I DID AWESOME HI PRESS SO I GONZALEZ HI. GONZALEZ HI HERTZBERG. JONES LAYERED HI THERE I STERN. K. BY CAL SKI. WIECKOWSKI NOT VOTING. WIENER WIENER AYE SO FAR YOU HAVE. SIX TWO ZERO ALL RIGHT THANK YOU WILL PUT THAT ON CALL THANK YOU IT'S AN ARCH ALETTA NOW SENATOR NUMEROUS THANK YOU. THAT ARE NEWMAN. GETS THE AWARD. MERITORIOUS SERVICE AWARD. FOR BEING THE MOST PATIENTS TODAY. SAN ROMAN WE HAVE BEFORE US SB TWO EIGHT NINE. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AT THAT'S WITH AN OAK LEAF CLUSTER I MIGHT ADD. INDEED MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. I'M HERE BEFORE YOU TODAY TO ADVOCATE ON BEHALF OF S. B. TWO EIGHT NINE WHICH WOULD CREATE A CONVENIENCE STATEWIDE PRODUCER FUNNY COLLECTION AND RECYCLING PROGRAM FOR CONSUMER BATTERIES. AS YOU'RE PROBABLY AWARE BECAUSE OF THE HAZARDOUS METALS AND CORROSIVE METAMATERIALS THE BATTERIES CONTAIN CALIFORNIA CLASSIFIES BATTERIES AS HAZARDOUS WASTE WHEN EXPRESSLY BANS THEM FROM SOLID WASTE LANDFILLS WHEN PEOPLE ARE DONE WITH THEIR LOOSE BATTERIES IN PORTABLE ELECTRONICS. THEY ARE EXPECTED TO SAVE THEM SORT THEM AND THEN FIND INAPPROPRIATE DISPOSAL OPTION. UNFORTUNATELY BECAUSE CALIFORNIA CURRENTLY LACKS A STREAMLINED AND CONVENE A COLLECTION AND RECYCLING SYSTEM FOR BATTERIES AT THE MOMENT THIS TEND TO BE MORE THE EXCEPTION THAN THE RULE. I WOULD ASK YOU AS CONTACTING CONCERNING THE BILL BEFORE YOU TODAY TO TAKE A MOMENT TO THINK ABOUT ALL OF YOUR BATTERIES THINK ABOUT ALL THE DOUBLE A. AND TRIPLE. A. AND OTHER TYPES OF BATTERIES YOU GO THROUGH A YEAR. GOING ALL THE MANY DEVICES THE ARE SO DEEP EMBEDDED IN OUR- MODERN LIVES THESE DAYS THE REMOTE CONTROLS THE COMPUTER KEYBOARDS THE MICE THE CLOCKS THE FLASHLIGHTS. YOU'RE LIKELY TO PRESSURE KIDS TOYS IT CENTER NOW. THINK ABOUT ALL THE RECHARGEABLE DEVICES EVERYBODY CARRIES THESE DAYS AS WELL EACH ONE WITH ITS OWN LITHIUM ION. OR SIMILAR BATTERY NOW MULTIPLY YOUR BATTERIES BY CALIFORNIA'S POPULATION JUST UNDER FORTY MILLION PEOPLE IN THEN CONSIDER HOW CHALLENGING IT IS TO PROPERLY RECYCLE. ALL OF THOSE BATTERIES ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU CONSIDER THE FACT THAT THERE'S CURRENTLY NO UNIFIED SYSTEM IN PLACE. IN CALIFORNIA FOR DOING SO NOW CONSIDER THIS ALARMING FACT AS WELL. EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THOSE BATTERIES CONTAINS HAZARDOUS TOXIC AND CORROSIVE MATERIALS LIKE MERCURY CADMIUM. LITHIUM AND LET WHEN IMPROPERLY DISCARDED BATTERIES POSE A SERIOUS ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARD. BECAUSE OF A COMBINATION INCREASE CONSUMPTION A LACK OF CONVENE DISPOSAL OPTIONS. HIGHER LEVELS OF TOXIC BATTERIES AND PRODUCTS ARE CONTINUE ENTERING CALIFORNIA'S WASTE STREAM. WHEN BATTERIES ARE TOSSED INTO THE TRASH INSTEAD OF PROBABLY RECYCLE THE END UP IN LANDFILLS WHERE THEY DECAY AND LEAKAGE DISPOSABLE BATTERIES CORRODE. CHEMICAL SOAK INTO SOILING CONTAMINATE GROUNDWATER AND SURFACE WATER. DELEGATE ALREADY STRAINED ECOSYSTEMS ARE COMPROMISED WHEN EXPOSED TO BATTERY CHEMICALS WHEN WE DRINK FROM TAP WATER FAUCETS. WE COULD BE INGESTING DANGEROUS METALS. LITHIUM BATTERIES IN PARTICULAR CAN BE VERY UNSTABLE AND WHEN IMPROPERLY DISPOSED OPPOSE SERIOUS FIRE HEALTH AND SAFETY HAZARDS. IN FACT OVER THE PAST DECADE THE MASSIVE INFLUX OF IMPROPERLY DISPOSED OF LITHIUM ION BATTERIES. INTO CALIFORNIA VOICESTREAM HAS RESULTED IN ALARMING NUMBER OF FIRES IN OUR MATERIAL RECOVERY FACILITIES WASTE COLLECTION TRUCKS. AND OUR LANDFILLS WHEN LITHIUM ION BATTERIES BURNED IT RELEASES FLUORIDE GAS WHICH POSES SERIOUS TOXIC THREATS. TO HELP TO THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF WORKERS. FIREFIGHTERS AND THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITY TO VAPORIZE COMPONENTS OF BURN BATTERIES ALSO GET TRAPPED IN THE ATMOSPHERE AND POLLUTE LAKES AND STREAMS IN THE FORM OF ACID RAIN AS WELL AS CONTRIBUTING. TO GLOBAL WARMING. ACCORDING TO A TWENTY EIGHTEEN CALIFORNIA PRODUCTS TUITION COUNCIL SURVEY TWENTY OF THE TWENTY SIX MATERIAL RECOVERY FACILITIES THEY SURVEYED. EXPERIENCED AT LEAST ONE FIRE DURING THE PREVIOUS. TWO YEARS 65% OF WHICH WE'RE ALMOST TO THE WERE TRUE. IN DISCARD BATTERY. WITHOUT DRAMATIC REDUCING THE NUMBER OF LITHIUM ION BATTERIES AND WE CALIFORNIA'S WAY STREAM. CALIFORNIA WILL SUFFER ADDITIONAL FIRES THAT WOULD JEOPARDIZE WASTE OPERATIONS IN THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF WORKERS AND OUR COMMUNITIES YOU'LL BE HEARING FIRST HAND FROM ONE OF THE LEAD WITNESSES. THIS AFTERNOON ABOUT THE DEVASTATING IMPACTS. OF THESE FIRES. HUNDREDS PROVISIONS SB TWO EIGHT NINE WILL CREATE A COORDINATED SYSTEM. OF FREE AND CONVENIENT COLLECTION BINS FOR MOST LOSING PRODUCT EMBEDDED BATTERIES. AT RETAIL LOCATIONS ACROSS THE STATE TO ALLOW CONSUMERS TO PLACE BATTERIES INTO THE BINS FOR PROPER DISPOSAL. RATHER THAN DISCARDING THEM ALONG WITH THE REST OF THEIR HOUSEHOLD TRASH. THE BILL WOULD ALSO CREATE A CONSUMER OUTREACH AND EDUCATION CAMPAIGN TO EDUCATE CALIFORNIANS AND ENCOURAGES THE PROPER DISPOSAL OF ALL BATTERIES. THIS APPROACH TO POLICY GENERALLY FOR TWO IS EXTENDED PRODUCER RESPONSIBILITY WHICH SB TWO EIGHT NINE. WILL PROVIDE A CONSUMER BATTERIES HAS FIRM ROOTS IN CALIFORNIA LAW HAS BEEN PREVIOUS EMPLOYED EFFICIENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY IMPROVED. RECYCLING FOR AN ARRAY OF HARD TO RECYCLE MATERIALS FROM MATTRESSES TO AUTOMOBILE TIRES TOO. NOT COINCIDENTALLY CAR BATTERIES IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN THIS LEGISLATOR PASSED THE LEGISLATURE PASSED BY NEARLY UNANIMOUS VOTE SB TWO ONE TWO. AUTHORED BY OUR COLLEAGUE FORMER SENATOR HANNAH BETH JACKSON. WHICH REQUIRES MANUFACTURERS IN THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY TO TAKE BACK UNUSED AND WASTED NEEDLES AND DISCARDED DRUGS. SB TWO EIGHT NINE REPLICATE THIS MODEL AND CONTINUES THIS VERY POSITIVE TREND. THE OPPOSITION IS LIKELY TO ASSERT THAT THE BILL WOULD INCREASE THE COST OF VITAL PRODUCTS TO CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS. TO THAT I WOULD RESPECTFULLY POINT OUT THAT THE COSTS OF THESE LITHIUM ION INDUCED FIRES AS WELL AS THE GENERAL ENVIRONMENTAL DANGERS. ARE ALREADY BEING BORNE BY OUR WASTE RECYCLING OPERATORS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FIRE PROFESSIONALS THE ENVIRONMENT PUBLIC HEALTH AND CONSUMERS. AS A PARTIAL CONSEQUENCE CALIFORNIA CITY CENTERS FOR THE GARBAGE RATES WILL INCREASE INCREASE. IN THE NEXT THREE YEARS AND IN THESE LITHIUM ION BATTERIES. IF THESE LITHIUM BY EMBARRASSED CONTINUE BECAUSE TAX DEFERRED GROWTH STATE THE COST OF INSURING LOCAL WASTE. MANAGEMENT FACILITIES IS CERTAIN TO INCREASE AS WELL. THE PRODUCERS OF CONSUMER BACK ADORATION CURRENTLY SHOULDER ANY OF THE COSTA. WITH THE TALKS FIRES IN OUR INVENTOR INVITE HARMS. BY THEIR PRODUCTS BY ENROLLING PRODUCERS AS PART OF A MORE EFFECTIVE AND IN SYSTEM FOR RECYCLING CONSUMER BATTERIES. WE CAN PREVENT THESE DISASTERS FROM OCCURRING THEREBY SAVING THE COST PART GARBAGE RATES. WHILE PROTECTING THE HEALTH OF THE PUBLIC REDUCING THE RISK TO WASTE PERSONALLY WORKERS AND BETTER SAFEGUARDING CALIFORNIA'S LAND. WATER AND AIR. BINDING MANUFACTURES AND RETAILERS TO A SYSTEM SUCH AS THIS IS EMINENTLY SENSIBLE AND FAIR. AND CONSISTENT WITH OTHER SIMILAR EFFORTS IN CALIFORNIA AND ACROSS THE NATION. YOU LIKELY HER OPPOSITION MAKE REFERENCE TO A SIMILAR BILL THAT PASSED WATCHING TO SEE HOW THIS BILL COULD MODEL THAT ONE. SB TWO EIGHT NINE SHARES A FRAMEWORK SIMILAR TO THE DC BILL HOWEVER PLEASE NOTE THAT CALIFORNIA HAS ROUGHLY FIFTY SEVEN TIMES THE POPULATION WATCHING BC. IN A MUCH DIFFERENT RURAL VERSUS CITY DIVIDE. THEREFORE WELL WE VIEW THE DC MODEL IS A GOOD AND RELEVANT TO REFERENCE POINTS. NEPR BATTERIES AT RECYCLING PROGRAM IN CALIFORNIA WILL BE DIFFERENT REQUIREMENTS BASED ON OUR SIZE OUR DEMOGRAPHICS INTO RECYCLING STRUCTURES. USING DC HAS REFERENCE HOWEVER WE ARE CURRENTLY CONSIDERING MAKING ADJUSTMENTS. AROUND PERFORMANCE GOALS IN THE SIZES OF BATTERIES IN PRODUCTS COLLECTED. THE BILL'S SPONSORS IN MY OFFICE HAVE BEEN MEETING WITH OPPOSITION AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE OPEN TO DOING SO WERE CENSORED THEIR TO THEIR CONCERNS AND COMMITTED TO GENERATING SUPPORT AMONG ALL PARTIES. WHILE LEAVING THE INTENT OF THE BILL INTACT. WITH ME HERE IN THE CHAMBER TODAY TO TESTIFY AS JASON SCHMELZER. ON BEHALF ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA PRODUCT STEWARDSHIP COUNCIL. AND ON THE PHONE IS JOE LAW MARIANA EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF RETHINK WASTE I RESPECTFULLY. ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE THIS AFTERNOON. I YOU SENATOR. WELL WORTH THE WAIT- ALL RIGHT. SO MR SCHMELZER. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS AT JASON'S MOTHER HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA PRODUCT STEWARDSHIP COUNCIL ONE OF THE THREE CO SPONSORS OF SB TWO EIGHTY NINE SENATOR NEWMAN FOCUSED ON THE NEED FOR SB TWO EIGHTY NINE SO I'M GONNA FOCUS QUICKLY ON THE MECHANICS OF THE BILL SO WHAT IS THE BILL DO I'M SB TWO EIGHTY NINE ESTABLISHES A PERFORMANCE BASED RECYCLING SYSTEM FOR LOOSE BATTERIES IN CONSUMER PRODUCTS THAT CONTAIN NON REMOVABLE BATTERIES. PRODUCERS WOULD BE REQUIRED TO DESIGN FUND AND OPERATE A PROGRAM THAT WILL COLLECT AND RECYCLE THEIR PRODUCTS THEY CAN COMPLY INDIVIDUALLY BUT THE LIKELY RESULT IS THAT THEY WILL COMBINE TO FORM A STEWARDSHIP ORGANIZATION TO MANAGE THE PROGRAM ON THEIR BEHALF THE STEWARDSHIP ORGANIZATION SUBMITS A PLAN TO THE DEPARTMENT WHO THEN CHECKS THE PLAN TO MAKE SURE THAT IT MEETS ALL THE STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS. SB TWO EIGHTY NINE WOULD ALSO ESTABLISH A FEW DIFFERENT- PERFORMANCE GOALS TO KEEP THE PROGRAM O TRACK BUT OTHERWISE IT FREES UP THE INDUSTRY TO IMPLEMENT THEPROGRAM THAT WORK FOR THEM IT'S PERFORMANCE BASED AS OPPOSED TO COMMAND AND CONTROL THE DEPARTMENT CAN ADJUST THOSE PROGRAM PERFORMANCE GOALS OF YOUR REGULATIONS FOR ALL STAKEHOLDERS HAVE THE ABILITY. TO PROVIDE FEEDBACK AND I WOULD NOTE IF YOU LOOK AT EXISTING RECYCLING PROGRAMS HAVING SOME SORT OF FLEXIBILITY AND NOT HAVING CONVENIENCE STANDARDS LOCKED. INTO STATUTE- IS QUITE USEFUL. THERE'S NO FEE ON. COVER THE PRO. THE INDUSTRY. THE COST- AND WORKS OUT THOSE DETAILS AMONGST THEMSELVES. THEIR PENALTIES FOR NON COMPLIANCE BUT THEY'RE CONSISTENT WITH THE LAST PROGRAM THIS TYPE. THAT WAS PASSED BY THE LEGISLATURE EXTENDED ESTABLISHES AN ADVISORY COMMITTEE SO WHETHER STAKEHOLDERS. CAN HAVE INPUT INTO THE PROCESS. SB TWO EIGHTY NINE A STRUCTURED SIMILARLY TO RECENT LEGISLATION AS NOTED BY SENATOR NEWMAN. THE CREATED A PROGRAM FOR LEFTOVER DRUGS AND NEEDLES AT THE STATE HOUSE MAKERS OF. VITAL MEDICINES TO MITIGATE THE END OF LIFE IMPACTS OF THEIR PRODUCTS. AND ALL OF THE LEGISLATURE CAN CERTAINLY ASK THE SAME OF BATTERY MANUFACTURERS. TO BE CLEAR WE HAVE BEEN AND WILL CONTINUE PRO ACTIVELY WORKING WITH VARIOUS OPPONENTS WE FEEL VERY POSITIVE ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF COMING TO TERMS OF POLICE SOME OF THEM. AB FOR THOSE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR VOTE TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISSPELLED HER MISTER. LEMERRE JANA ARE YOU ON THE PHONE. YES I AM MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU SO MUCH GO AHEAD- YOU IN THE MEMBERS. MY NAME IS JOE LIBERTY ANA I AM THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE RETHINK WEIGHT PUBLICLY OWNED REGIONAL SOLVE PUBLIC WASTE MANAGEMENT AUTHORITY WE ARE FORMED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO. WE'RE VERY CONSERVATIVE COUNTY AND WE SIR FOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND RESIDENTS AND ABOUT ELEVEN THOUSAND BUSINESSES ACROSS ELEVEN JURISDICTIONS FOR ME AWHILE TO TALES BOROUGH. ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED OF OUR WORKERS OUR PEAK SUMMER FACILITY EVEN HANDLE ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND TONS. OF WASTE MATERIALS EVERY YEAR. THE WORKERS TAKE AND FACILITY- AT THREE RISK. FROM LITHIUM ION BATTERIES ALL THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY THREE GAVE THE YEARS THAT WE OPERATE. IN TWENTY SIXTEEN WE EXPERIENCED IT FIRSTHAND CATASTROPHIC. FIRES THAT WE BELIEVE WAS DUE TO A LITHIUM ION BATTERY AT A RECYCLING CENTER. OUR FACILITY WAS CLOSED DOWN PERFORMANCE IN BECAUSE EIGHT AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS WITH OF DAMAGE IS. OVER SIXTY WORKERS WERE FURLOUGHED DURING THIS TIME AND IT TOOK ABOUT A YEAR TO READ ONLY REPAIR EVERYTHING. IT THE FIRE HAD ONE INSURANCE PROVIDER TODAY WE NEED SEVEN FOR THE SAME LEVEL OF COVERAGE. IN FOUR YEARS OUR INSURANCE PREMIUMS HAVE RISEN TWELVE TIMES IN OUR DEDUCTIBLES HAVE MULTIPLIED BY A FACTOR OF OVER THREE HUNDRED TIMES. WITH HIM I AM BATTERIES ARE AN EXISTENTIAL THREAT. TO THE STATE SOLID WASTE INDUSTRY INTO THE SAFETY OF OUR TENS OF THOUSANDS OF WORKERS. INSURANCE PROVIDERS ARE SIMPLY FINDING IT TOO RISKY TO COVER. FACILITIES LIKE OURS AFTER THE EXTENT OF DAMAGES IN TWENTY SIXTEEN AND OTHER FIRES IN OUR INDUSTRY. WE'VE IMPLEMENTED MANY PREVENTATIVE MEANT MEASURES TO REMOVE LEVINE MINE BATTERIES FROM OUR WASTE STREAM. BUT WE'RE STILL STRUGGLING TO GET THEM ALL OUT. THE BATTERY WRITTEN A VERY TECH OVER A FUNDED WASTE COLLECTION AND RECYCLING INFRASTRUCTURE. SYSTEM ACROSS THE STATE. CRISIS MUST HAVE A SOLUTION NOW. HAS WILL BE MINE BATTERIES HAVE BECOME MORE AND MORE COMMON IN EVERYDAY PRODUCTS. SB TWO EIGHT NINE PROVIDING RESPONSIBLE WAY TO HANDLE MATERIALS AT THE END OF THEIR USEFUL LIFE.

I WEHAVE SPOKEN WITH THE AUTHOR AND THE PROPONENTS AND LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUE TO SPEAK WITH THEM. WE'VE NOT MADE ANY PROGRESS YET BUT WE UNDERSTAND AMENDMENTS WILL BE COMING OUT SHORTLY. YES WE DID SUGGEST THEY LOOK AT THE DC MODEL AND LAW CALIFORNIA'S EXPONENTIALLY LARGER THAN WASHINGTON DC. WE STILL THINK IT HAS SOME IMPORTANT ELEMENTS THAT ARE WORTH CONSIDERING. IN THIS BILL FOR EXAMPLE THERE IS A LACK OF DIRECTION CAL RECYCLE WHICH IS SOMEWHAT CONCERNING GIVEN THAT THEY HAVE A LOT AN ABSOLUTE. FIGURE FORTY WITH NO PERHAPS AS DOES EVERY OTHER STATE AGENCY THAT MAY BE IMPACTED BY BATTERY DISPOSAL. THE SENATOR NEWMAN DISCUSSED ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT WATER IMPACTS SIX CETERA THIS MEANS THE T. S. C. C. P. EIGHTY W. WALKED CALIFORNIA REX SARAH XCERRA. WOULD ALL BE ABLE TO IMPOSE FEES RETAILERS ARE ENTITLED TO IMPOSE FEES FOR UP FOR SPACE EMPLOYEE TRAINING INSURANCE. SIX CETERA- THE MEASURE REFERS TO PROVIDE. AND PRODUCERS IS KIND OF A- TIMER FOR TO THE BACK MAKER. THE PRODUCT MAKER HIM BATTERY IN IT THE IMPORTER DISTRIBUTOR AND RETAILER ALL THOSE ENTITIES WOULD HAVE TO REGISTER WITH POWER CYCLE. BY APRIL FIRST TWENTY TWENTY TWO SO FOUR MONTHS AFTER THE BILL TAKES EFFECT NOW WE WON'T KNOW WHICH OF THOSE ENTITIES WILL BELONG TO THE STORE TO SHOP AT THAT POINT. SOME OF THE REPORTING WILL BE ENTIRELY REDUNDANT AS NEAR AS WE CAN TELL FAILURE TO REPORT WOULD SUBJECT THEM TO ATTEND A FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLAR PER DAY.

GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN BIRDS ASPECT MEANWHILE ON BEHALF OF THE CONSUMER TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. THANK YOU. I HAVE NO ONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION EITHER THANK YOU MADAM MODERATOR BRING IT BACK TO THE CHAMBERS HE SAID A WHITE CAL SKIS MIKE IS UP SOMEWHERE CAL SKI. ZURCHER I WOULD SIT ON THE ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY COMMITTEE SO I ENJOYED. THE ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS- I'D LIKE TO DRAW. YOUR ATTENTION INTENTION THE AUTHOR TO PAGE. STARTING AT PAGE ELEVEN WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE PROHIBITION AGAINST ECONOMIC. PROTECTIONISM AND EMBEDDED IN THE- DOORMAT OF COMMERCE CLAUSE. IT APPEARS. HERE'S THE WELL- THE KEY SAID ON PAGE THIRTEEN C. A. CARBONE VERSUS THE TOWN OF CLARKSTON. IT IS DISTINGUISHABLE BECAUSE THIS IS ONE CITY IN THE STATE IN YOUR PURSE THE WHOLE STATE. THE LANGUAGE THAT'S USED IN THE ANNUAL REPORT AND THE- PREFERENCE THAT THE TO PRIORITIZE IN USE OR USE OF IN STATE PROCESSING FACILITIES OVER. OUT OF STATE PROCESSING FACILITIES ON ITS FACE OF VIOLATION OF DEPARTMENT COMMERCE CLAUSE SO. IF THE- ALL THE EXPERTS- THE. CHALLENGE THAT THIS OTHERWISE FIND BILL HAS THANK YOU MISTER WHAT KOWSKI SAID A NEW ONE YOU COULD ADDRESS THAT NOW IN YOUR CLOTHES- I'LL DO IT NOW SO. I APPRECIATE YOUR CONCERN- AS AS MOVES FOR A LOOK INTO IT I THINK YOU RAISE A SELLING POINT. YEAH RT. BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO SAY OF WELL SAID SENATE HUESO- THAT THE BILL WILL BE A AS WE MOVEFOR FROM THERE TO ADDRESS IS FOR THE- THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT I SEEN OTHER MICROPHONES AND YES I DO SENATE CAREER MICROPHONES OFF. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR I JUST WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR THIS- THIS BILL I THINK- ONE OF THE CHALLENGES WE HAVE IS WE- CONTINUE TO EXPAND THE USE OF ELECTRONIC- OF. DEVICES AS WELL AS- BATTERIES AS AT AND USE BATTERIES FOR STORAGE- WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE REAL. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT THAT MINING FOR THESE PRODUCTS HAS ON THE WORLD IN THE FACT THAT WE HAVE- SEE AT PLACES ALL OVER THE WORLD IN MIND THIS REALLY IMPORTANT MINERAL THE IMPORTANT MINERALS THAT GO INTO THESE DEVICES AND THEN WE'RE JUST THROWING THEM INTO THE LANDFILL TO THE MORE THAT WE CAN SET UP A REASONABLE LOGICAL RECYCLING OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABLE TO TAKE OUT THAT MATERIAL REUSE IT IS IT'S GOING TO BE IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF ALL OF US SO I SUPPORT BELLI. AM NOT I MAKE GNOSTIC AS TO HOW WE DO THIS WHETHER IT'S A FEE ON THE SALE OF A PART OF THE PROJECT THE THING GOES INTO RECYCLING OR THE WAY THAT IT'S PROPOSED IN THIS BILL BUT I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT. THANK YOU SAID A COUPLE YEARS. HERTZBERG I WANT TO SAY MAKE TO CENTER COULD BE COME ABOUT THE PRO BY I GOTTA TELL YOU I SPENT. TWELVE YEARS OF THE GOVERNMENT WORKING IN THE RENEWABLE ENERGY SPACE IN THE PRINCIPLE AREA THAT I WAS FOCUSED ON WAS ELIMINATING BATTERIES THE LANDFILL PROBLEMS AND ALL THE CHALLENGES WE TEND TO THINK THAT. WE HAVE RECHARGEABLE BATTERIES THE EXTRAORDINARY CONSEQUENCES TO THE STUFF I WAS TRYING TO USE SOLAR IN LIEU OF BATTERIES. BUT BUT- WHATEVER BUT IT BECAME SO CLEAR TO ME AS I TRAVELED AROUND TO SO MANY DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE WORLD WITH A BIG PROBLEM THIS IS AND I DON'T KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT HIS REGULATORY STRUCTURE IN TERMS OF THE BILL BUT I JUST WANT TO JOIN IN BECAUSE I THINK THIS IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT ISSUE AND I APPLAUD. THE AUTHOR FOR TAKING IT ON IT'S A VERY VERY BIG ISSUE THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER HURTS. ALL RIGHT ANY OTHER MICROPHONES NO MICROPHONES. SENATOR YES CENTERS FOR YOU AT SOMEONE ELSE OR YOU WANT TO JUST A LITTLE HE MOVED THE BILL ALL RIGHT SIR NEWMAN THERE A PLAGUE MISTER THANK YOU COMMITMENT SO TO. SEND A COUPLE YEARS POINT HERE JUST A STEP- INTO SEVEN RUN A BIRD EACH. THAT'S FOURTEEN YEARS PEOPLE IN THE UNITED STATES THROUGH A TWO POINT FIVE MILLION TONS OF CELL PHONES TV'S COMPUTERS AND PRINTERS AND ALL OF THE ASSOCIATED LITHIUM IN BATTERIES WITHIN THEM. JERRY THIS IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM I WILL SAY- I TAKE SERIOUSLY MR GOVERNOR'S COMMENTS- WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS IS NEITHER TOO COMPLEX- NOR TOO EXPENSIVE- BUT AND ENTERED SYSTEM LIKE pWORKED IN OTHER STATES. AND WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE RANGE OF SUPPORT- TO INCLUDE ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS COUNTY CITY GOVERNMENT AND WASTE MANAGEMENT AGENCIES WHERE THREE QUARTERS OF THE WAY THERE THE NEXT STEP IS TO GET OUR PRODUCERS AND RETAILERS- TO A PLACE WHERE THEY'RE COMFORTABLE AND COMMITTED TO WORKING TOWARD THAT. ENHANCE RESPECTFULLY FOR YOUR AYE VOTE TODAY THANK YOU THE. CENTER HERTZBERG MOVE THE BILL. BANNON CHIEF COUNT A STRONG PLEASE THE ROLL. THIS IS AS TO A NINE SENATOR NEWMAN WITH- BY SENATOR. THE MOST IS DEEP. BUT FIRST BE REAR TO COMMITTEE A PER. AMBER I- BURKE AYE BOARD YES. CABALLERO CAVITE I DID I SAW LINES THAT ARE I. HI GONZALEZ HI. FOR ITS FOR I'D JOE. PLAYER BY CLEARED STERN. YEAH WAIT CAL SKI. I CAN'T AYE WIENER. YES TO ZERO SO ALREADY WE'LL PUT THAT AND CALL THANK YOU SIR NEWMAN THANK YOU DOLLY I CENTER HERE MOMENT AGO CENTER HERE THE CHAMBER. IF CENTER DAHLE IS NOW HERE. I SAW. EGGMAN HERE. IS WHAT WILL WILL GIVE CENTER DOLLAR JUST A FEW. ALL RIGHT- WHILE WE GO AHEAD LET'S HEAR A CENTER EGGMAN'S BILL. SO THAT IS S. B. SIX OH FIVE NUMBER EIGHT ON YOUR ACCOUNT ON YOUR SCHEDULE. RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS IT IS MY PLEASURE TO BE HERE. YOU'RE LISTENING TO YOUR HAVE VIGOROUS CONVERSATIONS- PERSONAL LIKE TO START UP BY ACCEPTING THE COMPANY AMENDMENTS LAID OUT IN THE ANALYSIS AND THINK- THE CHAIR AND THE STAFF FOR WORKING ON THIS. A VERY FINE ANALYSIS IF WE MAY ADD- SB SIX OH FIVE IS A NARROW BILL AIMED AT IMPROVING THE ACCESS AND SAFETY OF REPAIRING MEDICAL DEVICES- BUT I THINK IT'S A FITTING FOR ME TO MENTION THE BROADER RIGHT TO REPAIR MOVEMENT IN LIGHT OF- THE OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. AT% THE GOALS OF THE RIGHT TO REPAIR AND PEOPLE MAY KNOW IT'S A MOVEMENT KIND OF MOVING AROUND THE COUNTRY HAS BEEN FOR A WHILE- THE GOALS OF THAT ARE TO REDUCE WASTE. INCREASE COMPETITION FOR REPAIR TO SUPPORT LOCAL BUSINESS TO IMPROVE PRODUCT DURABILITY AND TO RESTORE WHAT IT ACTUALLY MEANS TO TRULY OWN OUR OWN STUFF I THINK WE CAN PROBABLY ALL AGREE ON THOSE BROAD PRINCIPLES. I AM A AND OUR CONVERSATION TODAY THE SADISTIC HAPPENING ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. AND THE IS THEN HOW DO WE TAKE THESE BROAD PRINCIPLES THAT WE ALL BASICALLY AGREE ON. AND PUT THEM INTO PUBLIC POLICY WHICH IS WHAT'S BEFORE US TODAY. YOU'LL SEE A LARGE NUMBER OF ORGANIZATIONS WHO ARE OPPOSE THIS BILL AND SOME YOU'LL THINK WHY ARE THEY OPPOSED TO THIS SPECIFIC BILL. WELL THE IF THIS TURNS TO BE A BUSINESS MODEL WHERE A MANUFACTURER. PRODUCES A DEVICE FILLED IT TO YOU AND THEN ALSO. MADEYOU MAY OR MAY NOT KNOW BUT THEN ARE THE ONLY ONES WHO WANT TO BE ABLE TO FIX THAT SAIDDEVICE SO. THE QUESTION THEN BECOMES DO YOU OWN THAT DEVICE OR DOES THE MANUFACTURE CONTINUE TO OWN THE DEVICE. AND KEEP YOU TETHERED TO IT THROUGH MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR AND PARTS- SO WHILE THIS BILL IS VERY NARROW AND SPEAKING SPECIFICALLY TO MEDICAL DEVICES IN HOSPITALS AND CLINICS- THE OPPOSITION TENDS TO GROUP TOGETHER BECAUSE- OF A- BECAUSE AGAIN IT'S A BUSINESS MODEL THAT GOES ACROSS DIFFERENT KINDS OF. ELECTRICAL ELECTRONIC APPLIANCES- THIS BILL TAKES A SIMPLE APPROACH LOOKING AT JUST ONE CATEGORY PRODUCTS POWERED MEDICAL DEVICES AND TRIES TO OPEN UP. THE REPAIR MARKET BY ALLOWING ACCESS TO THE NEEDED PARTS TOOLS DOCUMENTATION AND SOFTWARE. FOR MAINTENANCE AND REPAIRS NOW LET ME STAY BEFORE I GO ANY FURTHER BECAUSE PEOPLE SAY OH YOU CAN'T DO THAT. THIS IS ALREADY DONE. THIS IS ALREADY LEGAL THIS IS ALREADY HAPPENING HOSPITALS CAN HAVE THEIR OWN- BIO TECHNICIANS THEY CAN CONTRACT WITH EITHER. A LOCAL BIO TECHNICIANS WITH OTHER LOCAL REPAIR SHOPS. BUT THE ISSUE IS A LOT OF THE MANUFACTURERS WILL THEN PUT ON. HOLD NOT MAKE PARTS AVAILABLE WILL NOT MAKE SCHEMATIC AVAILABLE WILL NOT MAKE TOOLS AVAILABLE WILL NOT MAKE TRAINING AVAILABLE SO ANYONE ELSE WILL BE ABLE. AND OFTENTIMES WILL- PUT IN CODES SO THAT YOU CANNOT ACCESS. TO BE ABLE TO WORK ON THESE DEVICES- ACCESS TO THESE RESOURCES WOULD BE LIMITED ALSO A TO OPENING THAT UP. TO MAKE THEM NEEDED PARTS DOCUMENTATION AND SOFTWARE FOR MAINTENANCE REPAIR ACTIONS THESE RESOURCES WILL BE LIMITED TO HOSPITALS AND THOSE INDEPENDENT INDEPENDENT SERVICE PROVIDERS REFER TO AS I. S. P.'S WORKING WITH HOSPITALS ON THE MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR OF THEIR EQUIPMENT. EARLY REPORTING ON COALBED HIGHLIGHTED NOT JUST A LACK OF INVESTMENT IN OUR SUPPLY AND EQUIPMENT STOCKPILES BUT THE CHALLENGING. AB DE THAT PRESENTS IN TRYING TO REPAIR MEDICAL EQUIPMENT THE KEY TAKE AWAY IS NOT THAT THIS WAS A PROBLEM BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC BUT WE ALL JUST LEARN MORE ABOUT THE EXISTING PROBLEM. THAT WAS ALREADY THERE MADE VISIBLE BY THE PANDEMIC. HOSPITALS IN CALIFORNIA MAY EMPLOY IN HOUSE BY A TECHNICIAN BIOENGINEERS TECHS THAT WORK ON IN AN INDEPENDENT. ON ALL CAR BASIS- THESE ARE ROFESSIONALS WHO ARE TRAINED TO THE TO THE DEGREE AS AS THE MANUFACTURER'S TECHNICIANS BUT THEY'RE INDEPENDENTLY EMPLOYED OR HAVE THEIR OWN BUSINESS- THESE ARE PROFESSIONALS AVE IDENTIFIED THE MANUFACTURER CREATED BARRIERS TO REPAIR. IS CRUCIAL HINDRANCE TO THEIR WORK. AND PAID INTO PATIENT CARE JUST LAST YEAR IN A SURVEY OF BIOMED. YOU WHISPERED FOUND THAT 92% OF RESPONDENTS REPORT THAT THEY HAVE BEEN DENIED ACCESS TO SERVICE INFORMATION FOR CRITICAL EQUIPMENT. 30% REPORTED EQUIPMENT AND THE FACILITIES THAT COULD NOT BE USED DUE TO RESTRICTIONS ON SPARE PARTS AND SERVICE INFORMATION. AND NEARLY 7% ABOUT 70% OF RESPONDENTS AT THE HOSPITAL HAD TO DELAY PATIENT PROCEDURE BECAUSE THEY WERE WAITING ON A MAC MANUFACTURER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE TO FIX THE DEVICE. THE SURVEY NUMBERS CALIFORNIA HOSPITALS WHO SUPPORT THIS EFFORT AND REPORT THAT MANUFACTURERS ARE OFTEN UNABLE TO SERVICE EQUIPMENT AT THE TIME FRAME NEEDED. AND THE HOSPITAL'S TEAM MUST THEN DECIDE BETWEEN TAKING A MACHINE OFFLINE- THAT IS DUE FOR REGULAR MAINTENANCE. OR NOT HAVING IT MADE ITS MAIDEN SCHEDULE WHICH THEN COULD RESULT IN THEM AT NOT BEING PAID BY MEDICARE AND BECAUSE THEY ARE A GOVERNED UNDER CMS SO THEY HAVE TO KEEP THE MACHINES UP TO DATE. WITH MAINTENANCE. I AM DEPARTMENTS WOULD ARGUE THAT THE EQUIPMENT IS TOO COMPLICATED. THAT ONLY THEIR TRAIN PEOPLE CAN REPAIR THEM- BUT THE WRIST CARE REALLY FALLS ON THE PATIENTS AND HOSPITALS RELY ON THESE MACHINES TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THE MACHINE READY TO BE USED WHEN THE PHYSICIAN WHEN THE HOSPITAL. NEEDS TO USE IT- ALL THE CONSUMER ADVOCATES AND HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS AGREED THAT THIS BILL COULD HELP. IN THE HEALTH CARE ANALYSIS THEY CITED- AND ALSO IN YOUR EXCELLENT ANALYSIS DID A GREAT JOB BREAKING DOWN THE FINDINGS OF THE FTA. REPORTS IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN TO HIGHLIGHT A LITTLE BIT- THAT AFTER EXTENSIVE REVIEW THEY DID NOT BELIEVE THAT A SAFETY PROBLEM EXISTS WITH THE SERVICING MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR OF MEDICAL DEVICES BY EITHER THIRD PARTY ORGANIZATIONS. OR MANUFACTURING THIS BILL SIMPLY REQUIRING THAT THE SAME PARTS TOOLS INFORMATION SOFTWARE AND TRAINING AVAILABLE TO MANUFACTURERS AUTHORIZED REPAIR NETWORK. ALSO BE AVAILABLE TO THOSE EXPERT THIRD PARTIES AN IN HOUSE ENGINEERS WHO ALREADY WORK ON THIS CRITICAL. EQUIPMENT WHEN DEVICES GO OFFLINE AND CARES DELAYED ITS PATIENTS THAT SUFFER. THIS BILL CAN INCREASE COMPETITION REDUCE COSTS AND HELP PEOPLE. IT EGGNOG IS THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO CAN FIX THINGS WHOSE JOB IT IS TO FIX THINGS. AND SAYS THEY SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO ACCESS TO THOSE TOOLS PARTS DOCUMENT. AND TRAINING SO THEY CAN DO SO SAFELY. AND TIMING- I HAD WITH ME HERE TODAY IS KEVIN O. RILEY WITH U. S. PER LIG. AND AT. NOT HAMOUD A SEASON CLING ENGINEER MANAGER UP TO YEARS. ALL RIGHT MISTER RILEY. YOUR AVAILABLE. I AM- THANK YOU VERY MUCH AMERICAN MEMBERS COMMITTEE HOW MANY KEVIN ALL I A TO ADVOCATE WITH US PURGING BURGER COSTA THE BILL. MANUFACTURERS ARE. RICH HOT AND INDEPENDENT BIOMEDICAL REPAIR TECH- BIOMED FROM BUT CENTRAL. RIGHT THE ACTION HE SAID- MARCH TWENTY INDEPENDENT SURVEY ORDER RISKY ONE HUNDRED FROM THE HOSPITAL TO WORK ON THE STORY RUNNING IT YEAH YES YOU HAVE ANOTHER TO ON THE NEAR YOUR- MICROPHONE. A COMPUTER ANOTHER AYE AYE HAVE THAT OKAY BY I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE IS GOING TO. SORRY ABOUT THAT- SO YEAH I DON'T SAYING THAT WOULD LIMIT SERVICE. THAT RECEIVED HUNDRED. FROM HOSPITAL GOOD WORKS WITH AND DOES VENTILATOR. KILEY USE MEANING FOR MONTHS THAT THEY COULD NOT BE USED TO TREAT COPD PATIENTS. I DON'T HAVE ANYWHERE CLOSE TO THAT MUCH TIME TO WAIT ESPECIALLY DURING A PANDEMIC. AND THIS DOESN'T JUST HAPPEN WITHIN A LEADERS OR JUST WITHIN THEIR- INDEPENDENT SERVICE PROVIDERS IT'S NO WONDER THE STORES RECEIVES SUCH STRONG SUPPORT FROM HOSPITALS PARTICULARLY IN RURAL COUNTIES THAT OFTEN EXPERIENCE LONGER WAITS FOR MANUFACTURE TECHNICIANS. MANUFACTURED IS THAT WHILE THEY HAVE MONOPOLIZED ASPECTS OF REPAIR IT IS A BENEVOLENT MONOPOLY ONE DONE TO PROTECT US. BUT WE CAN'T IGNORE THE DAMAGE OF REPAIR RESTRICTIONS THE PATIENT. THE FACT THAT RAISES THE COST OF HEALTHCARE. ONLY TAKES CONCERNS SERIOUSLY SO WE LOOK AT THE DATA AND IN A TWENTY EIGHTEEN REPORT THE FDA STATED THAT MANY THIRD PARTY ENTITIES PROVIDE HIGH QUALITY. AND EFFECTIVE SERVICING ON MEDICAL DEVICES AND THAT THE CONTINUED AVAILABILITY OF THIRD PARTY ENTITIES TO SERVICE REPAIR MEDICAL DEVICES IS CRITICAL TO THE FUNCTIONING OF THE U. S. HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. THAT'S WHY WE NEED ANOTHER CONSUMER AND PUBLIC HEALTH GROUPS SUPPORT SB SIX APPLIES. THIS BILL DOES NOT MAKE ANY CHANGES TO THE EXISTING LIABILITY STRUCTURE IN THE RARE CASE THAT A DEVICE FAILURE LEADS TO INJURY. WEBER IS FOUND RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PART FOR THE PROBLEM BE IT A MANUFACTURING DEFECT OF ALL TO REPAIR OR USER ERROR. WILL BE HELD LIABLE. IT IS COMMON PRACTICE FOR HOSPITALS AND INDEPENDENT SERVICE PROVIDERS TO KEEP LIABILITY INSURANCE FOR SUCH CASES. AND ALL OF THIS WILL CONTINUE TO BE THE CASE WHEN THE BABY COMES LAW.

BUT BE CRYSTAL CLEAR MEDICAL DEVICE COMPANIES ARE THE ONLY ENTITY IN THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM REGULATED FOR MEDICAL BY PREPARE. INDEPENDENT REPAIR PROVIDERS ARE NOT REGULATED BY ANY GOVERNMENT ENTITY SUPPORTERS CLAIM THEY'RE REGULATED BY CMS BUT THE MATH OF NOT REGULATE REPAIR MEDICAL BY. THIS ELIMINATES ANY FOR INDEPENDENT PROVIDERS SEEK AUTHORIZATION FROM DEVICE COMPANIES AND AUTHORIZATION IS A CRITICAL TOOL FOR UPHOLDING STANDARDS CREATING ACCOUNTABILITY FOR REPAIRS. BECAUSE IN A REPAIR PROVIDERS HAVE NO REGULATION NO OVERSIGHT. AND NO RECORD KEEPING REQUIREMENTS IT'S A CONDITIONS WHERE. REPAIRS WILL. INJURIES AND MEDICAL HELP CLAIMS WILL RISE WITHOUT YES TO WHO SHE LIABLE. JUST A LOT WEEK WE'VE BEEN IN. RECALL OF INFUSION IN. REPAIR BY ANDRE TECHNICIANS WHO HAD ACCESS TO BE AT THE PARTS BUT CHOSE TO A THEM TO CAMP. AND SECOND GUESSED FDA INSTEAD IS CHIU ON A PER PARTS CREATING DANGERS TO PAY. WELL WITH ERINA WILD AS YOURSELF SHOULD BE LAW THE STITCH. WOULD YOU WANT LOVED ONE TREATED USING A QUICK REPAIR BY PEOPLE THAT ARE UNDER. AND LACK OF. SHOULD BE LIABLE PRIVATE. BREACH FOR RANSOM ATTACKS. AND HOW DO WE PUT ELECT PROPERTY IS THE BAY OF THE LIFESAVING. WE OBJECT IN THE IDEA THAT THE CURRENT SYSTEM DOES NOT WORK THERE'S ROBUST COMPETITION THE INDEPENDENT REPAIR SPACE UP TO TWENTY THOUSAND TO REPAIR COMPANIES IN THE UNITED STATES. AND THE REPAIR PROVIDERS OF BIO MED'S PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE SYSTEM. BUT AUTHORIZATION PLAYS A CRITICAL ROLE IN UPHOLDING STANDARDS REGULATION PATIENT SAFETY. THE BILL IS DANGEROUS THE RESULT RELATES HOLDEN ARBITRARY CORNER CUTTING BY INDEPENDENT CARE PROVIDERS WANT ALL OF OUR TECHNOLOGY WITHOUT ANY OF THE RESPONSIBILITY TO REGULATION WE URGE YOUR. NO VOTE TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU MR GREEN. MISTER SIMONE THIS IS A MONNING. YEAH MITCHELL CAN YOU HEAR ME SIR YES GO AHEAD. RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MY NAME'S JEFF SIMONE THE VICE PRESIDENT OF QUALITY PRIMARY MEDICAL SYSTEMS. WE MAKE MEDICAL LINEAR ACCELERATORS WHICH CREATE RADIATION TO TREAT CANCER. VETERANS MEDICAL LINEAR ACCELERATORS ARE SOPHISTICATED MACHINES MORE QUICKNESS LOCATED WITHIN SHE'LL BUNKERS HAVE SPECIAL POWER AND WATER REQUIREMENTS TO ENSURE SAFETY FOR PATIENTS. AND CLINICAL CARE STAFF WE RESPOND TO SERVICE CALLS ANYWHERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WITHIN THIRTY MINUTES BECAUSE OUR HIGHEST PRIORITIES TO ENSURE PATIENT CARE CONTINUES. WE OFFICES OF DANGEROUS BY. LIKE OVER FIREWALL AND CYBER SECURITY PROTECTIONS IN A WAY ALLOWS PATIENTS PERSONAL HEALTH INFORMATION TO BE BREACHED. OVERRIDING SAFETY INTERLOCKS IMPROPER SERVICING OF THE MECHANICALS OF THE DEVICES LIKE A COLLECTING WATER LINES AND RADIATION SHIELDING ADJUSTMENTS. OCCASIONALLY TO THE POINT A FULL MACHINE FAILURE. THE ULTIMATE LIABILITY FOR MACHINE ENDS UP WITH US EVEN THOUGH WE HAD NO KNOWLEDGE WHAT WAS BEING DONE BY THE IRAQIS ARE NOT REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN RECORDS. THERE'S NO LIABILITY PROTECTION INCLUDED THIS BILL FOR US WITH OUR MACHINES ARE ADULTERATED BY OTHERS. FINALLY STILL DOES NOT PROTECT VERY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY WE PROVIDE SERVICE MANUALS AND TRAINING AND PARTS FOR CERTAIN BASIC SERVICES FIFTIES WE WANT OUR CUSTOMERS TO KEEP CANCER PATIENT TREATMENT ON TIME. AND WITHOUT DISRUPTION HOWEVER. I SEVEN DECADES OF EXPERIENCE ALLOWS US TO MORE QUICKLY RESOLVE PROBLEMS WITHOUT MACHINES IN EITHER OUR CUSTOMERS OR IRAQIS. THIS BILL WOULD FORCE US TO TURN OVER SENSITIVE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY WHICH IS DESIGNED TO PREVENT ADULTERATION OR DAMAGE EQUIPMENT THAT COULD ALSO EXPOSE CLINICAL PERSONNEL TO DANGEROUS RADIATION. SO I ASK YOU WOULD YOU WANT YOUR FAMILY TREATED ON ONE OF THESE MACHINES BUT UNREGULATED TECHNICIANS. AND WHO WOULD BEAR THE LIABILITY OF THE UNINTENDED. CONSEQUENCES OF THIS DANGEROUS BILL.

P. I SHARE THAT CONCERN I ALSO KNOW THE CONCERN WITH RESPECT TO A PARTICULAR. ISSUE AREAS OR INDUSTRIES OR DEVICES THAT MAY REQUIRE MORE- SOPHISTICATION MORE TRAINING THAN THAN OTHERS AND- YOU AND I SPOKE ABOUT THIS BRIEFLY BUT I ASSUME YOU'LL BE AMENABLE TO FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS TO THE LAW TO MAKE SURE THAT THE IP IS PROTECTED. AND THAT IN CERTAIN AREAS THAT REQUIRE. MORE TRAINING FOR EXAMPLE- OR MORE TECHNOLOGY THAT YOU'LL BE AMENABLE TO ENTERTAINING SUCH CARVE OUTS. CERTAINLY MISTER CHAIR WE'VE BEEN WORKING IN THE SPACE FOR YEARS AND WILL CERTAINLY DO WHATEVER WE NEED TO DO TO ADDRESS OUR ISSUES AS WE STATED WE DON'T WE DON'T THINK THERE'S- I. P. ISSUES BUT WE CERTAINLY RESPECT THAT THAT THERE COULD BE A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION AND WITHOUT REALLY TO LOOK AT THAT. AND AS WELL AS LIKE WE WE'VE WILL CONTINUE TO NARROW AND WE ARE CERTAINLY. OPEN TO NARROWING FURTHER IF NEED BE. THANK YOU THANK YOU SIR EGGMAN ALL RIGHT TO GET A CLOSE. I'M SORRY- SIR JONES IS YOUR MICROPHONE UP SOME JONES I WAS NOT SIR I'M JUST I'M SORRY I MISSED THE OPPORTUNITY TO. FOR A- COMMITTEE COMMENTS I JUST HAD A QUICK QUESTION IN. I KNOW THAT I DON'T THINK CMAT HAS. OPINED ON THIS YET OFFICIALLY BUT I KEEP HEARING THAT THEY MAY HAVE OPPOSITION AND I THINK ONE OF THE- THINGS THAT THEY'RE LOOKING FOR IS A AMENDMENT. DEALING WITH MEDICAL MALPRACTICE FOR THE DOCTORS SO I WAS JUST WONDERING IF YOU HAD THOSE CONVERSATIONS. YOU KNOW WHAT WHERE YOU ARE AT AND THAT PROCESS- AND THEN A LOT OF THE CALLERS- THAT WE'RE CALLING IN TODAY- ARE FROM MY AREA SO I NEED TO LOOK INTO THAT TOO SO IF YOU CAN JUST ADDRESS TO SEE ANYTHING THAT BE GREAT. CERTAINLY YEAH WE HAVE JUST HEARD RECENTLY FROM CMA THAT THEY MAY HAVE SOME ISSUES OTHER ISSUES ARE ARE AROUND. AND UNITY YOU KNOW MALPRACTICE AS WE WOULD UNDERSTAND THEIR ALREADY EXISTING CO AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THIRD PARTY. RIGHT SO WHOEVER IS RESPONSIBLE THIS IS RESPONSIBLE SO- WE HAVE REACHED OUT FOR CONVERSATIONS AND WILL CERTAINLY BE WORKING WITH THEM GOING FORWARD. AND YES THE- THE BIOMED COMPANY THAT SERVICES THE EQUIPMENT A LOT OF THEM ARE IN YOUR AREA SO I'M SURE. THAT YOU'LL BE HEARD FROM A LOT OF THEM TODAY ASSEMBLY BY THE MANUFACTURER AND SERVICE PARKS. I NOTICED THE BILL HAS. SUPPORT I'M GONNA LAY OFF TODAY BUT- WILL CONTINUE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE AUTHOR. THANK YOU SENATE JOHNSON SAID WHAT IS YOUR MICROPHONE UP. YES SIR. GO AHEAD THANK YOU. WE CERTAINLY HAD A LOT OF COLORS. THERE'S A LOT OF- INTEREST IN THIS BILL- I'M KIND OF TORN HIS YOU CAN AS A MAGICAL A LOT OF OUR COLLEAGUES ARE AND I USE THE EXAMPLE OF SOMETHING THAT WAS KIND OF FRUSTRATING TO ME ONCE- TO WATCH IF YOU. LET'S SAY YOU HAVE A WATCH AND- YOU WANT TO SEND IT TO A REPAIR SHOP AND NEXT THING YOU KNOW IT IT WOULD- IT WOULD DO AWAY WITH THE WARRANTY BECAUSE- MAYBE IT'S ON AUTHORIZED REPAIR SHOP. WERE WORKING THROUGH AN AUTHORIZED DEALER. AND I THINK IT'S- IT'S A ONE SIDED IT COULD BE HELPFUL TO HAVE AS MANY INDIVIDUALS. TRAINED IN HOW TO REPAIR- THESE THESE DEVICES AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE IT FACILITATES CIRCULATION THE PRODUCT CIRCULATES. THE THE TECHNOLOGY BASE AND THOSE LEARNING AND HOW TO BE A PART OF IT. ON THE FLIP SIDE IS. EVEN THOUGH THESE ARE PUBLICLY OF LARGELY PUBLICLY AVAILABLE MATERIALS THERE IS SOME CONCERN ABOUT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LOSS. AND I DIDN'T KNOW IF YOU HAD ANYTHING COMMENTS ON. COULD YOU NOT JUST SIMPLY CREATE AN AUTHORIZED REPAIR ENTITY THAT WOULD BE DOWN FOR EXAMPLE TO ME OF SOME FORM OF NON DISCLOSURE TO YOU STILL GET WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE AS A THROUGH A THIRD PARTY REPAIR. BUT THERE'S INTELLECTUALLY PROTECTIONS IS THAT SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN DISCUSSED AT SOME LENGTH- I BELIEVE WHEN THEY DID THE LAST STUDY THAT'S WHAT THEY SUGGESTED TO THE MANUFACTURERS THAT THEY PUT IN SOME KIND OF PASSWORD CODE AND TO BE ABLE TO GET THROUGH SO THEY COULD MAINTAIN WHAT THEY NEEDED TO FOR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTIES. BUT STILL MAINTAINS ACCESS TO FIXING IT BUT I WOULD ASK MY EXPERTS IF THEY'D LIKE TO COME IN AS WELL. YEAH THIS IS KEVIN O'REILLY WOULD GET. AFTER THAT THE ONE THING THAT I MENTION ABOUT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IS- WE SUBMITTED A LETTER ON THE APPLE TWELVE- I. T. LEGAL EXPERTS- ALL STATED IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL STATING THAT- I'VE BEEN BACKED UP. BY CONGRESS AND THE COURTS- TIME AND AGAIN THAT. NOT SOMETHING THAT CAN BE PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT SO THIS BILL IS NOT ABOUT TRYING TO GET ANY SORT OF- YOU KNOW TRADE SECRET COMPACTOR IS AN EXEMPTION FOR THE BILL TO MAKE SURE THAT. YOU KNOW NOTHING- IN THE BILL WOULD REQUIRE MANUFACTURERS TO PROVIDE BETWEEN SECRET. YOU HAVE TO DO TO SERVICE OR SOMETHING OF THAT NATURE SO WE ABSOLUTELY DON'T WANT TO EXPOSE. ANY OF MANUFACTURE SECRETS AND- WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL PUTS RISK. I'M MAY COULD I ASK FOR THE CLARIFICATIONS PRESENT. GO AHEAD- SEARCHERS USING- THAT GETTING EDUCATED THROUGH THAT MANUFACTURE- IN THAT WHOLE LINE OF- OF INFORMATION. OUR INTO HERE THAT CORRECTED THERE'S NO TRADE SECRET COMPONENT IN THE REVELATION OF- THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THOSE PRODUCTS. SO. SO AS FAR AS REPAIR GOES RIGHT- THIS BILL DOESN'T REQUIRE- MANUFACTURE TO TURN OVER ANY SORT OF DESIGN INFORMATION OR THINGS LIKE THAT- THERE IS YOU KNOW TRAINING IS INCLUDED IN THE BILL- IN ORDER TO- YOU KNOW AGAIN TO POINT TO THAT LETTER FROM THE TECHNICAL EXPERTS. THEY ARGUE THAT. THAT KIND OF INFORMATION IS NOT PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT- THAT SAID YOU KNOW I THINK THAT- THE PROTECTION THAT WE HAVE IN PLACE TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE. IS NO LOSS OF TRADE SECRETS AND ALSO ARE YOU KNOW THAT THE ONE OF THE THINGS. THAT THE BIOMED WORKING IN HOSPITALS IN POOR EYES. ARE NOT LOOKING TO TRY AND PUT. ANY SORT OF COMPUTING DEVICE ON THE MARKET RIGHT WHAT THEY WANT TO DO IS MAKE SURE THAT THE PATIENTS ARE HOPEFUL THAT NEED CARE. NEEDS I. THIS CALL ORDER TO USE. LIFESAVING TREATMENT. THAT DAY CAN SIX CLIP AND MAKE SURE. THE PATIENT CO THE BEST CARE. OKAY I COOPER GO ON BUT AT THE I THINK- I THINK OF AS SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT I THINK ARE MOST MOST IMPORTANT. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU. ANY OTHER MICROPHONES ANY OTHER MEMBERS FIVE SENATE MANY CHEMICALS. ED THANK YOU VERY MUCH- DO WE NEED A MOTION. THAT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA SYLER MOVES. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH- AS I AS I SAID THE BEGINNING THE OPPOSITION WILL COME ON FEARS AND FULL FORCE AND TRY TO SCARE YOU- YOU MIGHT RECALL IF YOU WERE IN THE LEGISLATURE COUPLE YEARS AGO I DID ONE ON. ALL RIGHTS REPAIR AND THEY WERE GOING AROUND SAYING YOUR PHONE COULD EXPLODE INTO AND BLOW UP THE BUILDING BECAUSE IT WAS SO DANGEROUS TO REPAIR WE KNOW WE KNOW THAT'S NOT TRUE AND WHO IS MORE CONCERNED ABOUT PATIENT SAFETY THEN THE VERY HOSPITALS THAT ARE PROVIDING THE CARE- THE TECHNICIANS ELECTRONICS THEY ARE ALL HIRED FROM THE SAME POOL RIGHT IF THEY WORK FOR THE ISO OR THEY HAVE A- THEIR OWN INDEPENDENT COMPANY OR THEY WORK FOR THE HOSPITAL. THIS IS ALSO ABOUT SAVING HEALTH CARE COST AN MRI MACHINE WHO GOES UP TO A MILLION DOLLARS IF YOU HAVE TO HAVE THAT CONTRACT WITH THAT- MANUFACTURE THAT CAN BE A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR LIKE A 10% RIGHT. AN IN HOUSE BIOMED PERSON CAN DO THAT A LOT MORE EFFECTIVELY ESPECIALLY IN RURAL PARTS OF THE STATE ESPECIALLY IN MORE REMOTE PARTS OF THE STATE TO BE ABLE TO GET THE WORDS OUT OF THE EQUIPMENT AGAIN WHICH I'M NOT REDUCING WASTE IMPROVING SAFETY IMPROVING HEALTHCARE OUTCOMES. AND MAKING SURE THAT IF YOU BUY SOMETHING YOU ACTUALLY OWN IT AND AREN'T TETHERED TO THAT MANUFACTURE FOREVER FOR REPAIRS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR ABOUT. THANK YOU THANK YOU COUNSEL PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. THIS IS SB SIX OH FIVE BY SENATOR EGGMAN WITH THE MOTION BY SENATOR THERE THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED BUT FIRST AMEND AND THEN RE REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS- BURKE. NUMBER GUY BURGESS. PORGES NOT VOTING. CABALLERO I HAVE A I DID ALSO HI GUYS SO I GONZALEZ HI GONZALEZ I HERTZBERG. JONES LAYARD ARE LAYERED ICE STERN. WHITE HOUSE SKI WHITE HOUSE SKI I WIENER. THE OF SIX TO ZERO SO FAR. THANK YOU. PUT THAT BILL ON CALL THANK YOU CENTER EGGMAN CENTER DOLLY. THANK YOU CENTER DOLLY THE FLOOR'S YOURS. GOOD AFTERNOON- MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS- FIRST TIME I'VE EVER PRESENTED IN FRONT OF THIS COMMITTEE SO- THE FARMER IN FRONT OF A BUNCH OF LAWYERS MIGHT BE KIND INTERESTING TODAY. TODAY IN PRESENTING SB FIVE FIFTEEN WHICH WILL PROVIDE EQUAL PROTECTIONS TO THE EMPLOYEES OF THE LEGISLATURE THAT EVERY THAT THE SAME WAS REQUIRED IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR- CURRENTLY THE LEGISLATURE PASSED THOUSANDS OF LAWS DICTATING EMPLOYEE WORK CONDITIONS AND HUNDRED REGULATIONS EACH YEAR. ON ON BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA. THE LEGISLATURE HAS BEEN CONVENE EXEMPTED. FROM THE SAME BURDENSOME LOS. LET ME GIVE A FEW EXAMPLES PROPOSITION SIXTY FIVE WHICH IS CHEMICALS HIGH FREQUENCY IN LAWSUITS AGAINST BUSINESSES THINGS LIKE FORMALDEHYDE IN YOUR IN OUR OFFICE FURNITURE THAT CAN CAUSE CANCER AND BIRTH DEFECTS PRIME RETARDANTS THATCAN CAUSE CANCER BIRTH DEFECTS AND LEAD FROM BRASS OBJECTS THAT CAN ALSO CAUSE CANCER BIRTH DEFECTS. WE'RE THE LEGISLATURE IS EXEMPTED FROM WAGING OUR OVERTIME PAY ALTERNATIVE WORK SCHEDULES. MILLIN REST PERIODS- WHICH ARE OFTEN IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR YOU CALLED PAGA LAWSUITS. BY VOTING AGAINST THIS BILL YOU'RE VOTING AGAINST THE LOWEST PAID EMPLOYEES TO PROTECT YOUR WHITE COLLAR EMPLOYEES ACTUALLY IN THE ANALYSIS AYE I LEARNED A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT. THE EXEMPTIONS AT THIS BILL THE THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS. SHIFTED FROM MY LAST COMMITTEE SO. IF YOU PAY DOUBLE THE MINIMUM WAGE. YOU'RE EXEMPTED YOUR IS CALLED THE WHITE COLLAR EMPLOYEES SO THAT WOULD MEAN YOU WOULD EARN SO TWO TIMES THAT SALARY- WOULD EXEMPT YOU FROM OVER TIME. AND TIME AND A HALF RULES SO ANY. LEGISLATIVE PERSON THAT WORKS HERE THAT IS PAID UNDER SIXTY TWO THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED- WOULD BE. UNDER THE PRIVATE SIDE WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR TIME AND A HALF- WHEN THEY'RE WORKED OVER EIGHT HOURS A DAY. I'M AN EMPLOYER AND AS MANY YOU KNOW AS AS SO YOU. SO I KNOW HOW VALUABLE THESE PROTECTIONS ARE AND I KNOW THE COST BECAUSE THEY CAN IT HOW COSTLY THEY CAN BE TO COMPLY WITH THESE LAWS. FOR EXAMPLE A FEW YEARS AGO THERE WAS A BILL WHICH EXEMPTED- AG PRODUCERS FROM PAYING. THAT IT WE HAD AN EXEMPTION WE COULD WORK SIXTY HOURS A WEEK BEFORE WE PAID OVERTIME. TYPICALLY WE USE THAT DURING. THE FARM IN THE PLANTING AND HARVEST TIME WELL THE LEGISLATURE CHANGED THE LAW- SO THAT THE IT'S BASICALLY. AT A EIGHT HOUR DAY OR FORTY HOURS A WEEK AND NOT MANY THERE WAS MANY TIMES IN A LOT. MANY MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE IN THE ASSEMBLY THEN. IT SAID IT WAS IT WAS ALMOST EQUIVALENT TO- SLAVE OWNERSHIP. THE COMMITTEE IN ALICE'S HIGHLIGHTED SOME POLITICAL ACTIVITIES AS A REASON TO NOT SUPPORT THIS BILL LABOR CODE SECTION- ELEVEN OH ONE THROUGH ELEVEN OH THREE. SO I LOOKED IT UP. IN BUT IT BASICALLY SAYS IS THAT- YOU CAN ALLOW YOUR EMPLOYEES TO DO POLITICAL WORK WELL. WE DO NOT DO POLITICAL WORK IN THE CAPITAL. WE DO WE DO POLICY WORK HERE AND IF YOU RECALL THERE'S MANY MANY MANY TIMES THERE'S BEEN POLITICAL WORK DONE IN THE CAPITAL. AND THE FBI HAS BEEN IN HERE AND GOING AFTER THOSE LEGISLATORS AND PEOPLE WHO WERE- NOT ABIDING BY LAW. IT HAS BEEN KNOWN FOR DECADES THAT THE LEGISLATOR DOESN'T APPLY WAGING OUR RULES TO ITSELF. CAMPBELL VERSES THE REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA TWO THOUSAND FIVE QUOTED THE SENATE COMMITTEE ON INDUSTRIALIZATION IS AS FOLLOWS. THESE PROVISIONS ARE SILENT AS TO THEIR APPLE BILL BACK ABILITY PUBLIC EMPLOYEES GENERAL. GENERALLY HOWEVER PROVISIONS OF THE LABOR LAW APPLY. TO EMPLOYEES IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR UNLESS THERE'S SPECIFICALLY MADE OPTICAL TO PUBLIC EMPLOYEES. EFFECTIVE JANUARY ONE NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT I W. C. WHICH IS THE INTERNATIONAL- INDUSTRIAL WELFARE COMMISSION ELIMINATED DAILY OVERTIME. FROM FIVE OF THE OF THE EXISTING FIFTEEN WAGE ORDERS. IN RESPONSE THE LEGISLATOR PASSED AND THE GOVERNOR SIGNED ASSEMBLY BILL NUMBER SIXTY IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE. THE EIGHT HOUR. D. RESTORATION AND WORKPLACE FLEXIBILITY ACT OF NINETEEN NINETY NINE AMONG OTHER THINGS THIS LEGISLATURE RESTORE THE EIGHT HOUR WORKDAY IN THE SECTION FIVE TEN AND MANDATED MANDATED MEAL AND PRAYER AND WRITTEN PERIODS IN SECTION FIVE TWELVE. MEMBERS EVERY DAY THIS LEGISLATURE TALKS ABOUT HOW BAD IT IS OUT THERE IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR- WHILE NOT LIVING UP TO THE SAME STANDARDS OURSELVES. MAKING THESE CHANGES IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO. AS WE WILL IN THE DOUBLE STANDARD OF EMPLOYEE PROTECTIONS THAT OUR OWN EMPLOYEES DO NOT ENJOY. WITH ME TODAY I HAVE BROUGH SUCH ARE AN ATTORNEY WITH THE LIVER LAW FIRM AS AS MY LEAD WITNESS MISTER CHAIRMAN. THANK YOU SENATOR HOLLINGS OF MR SERGEANT ARE YOU AVAILABLE. YES I'M HERE CAN YOU HEAR ME YES WE CAN GO AHEAD. THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I AM AN ATTORNEY IN PRIVATE PRACTICE REPRESENTING EMPLOYERS AND BUSINESSES AND ALL ASPECTS OF EMPLOYMENT LAW AND HAVE BEEN DOING SO FOR OVER THIRTY YEARS. I DON'T HAVE TODAY TO ADDRESS THE COSTS AND IMPACTS WHICH THE LEGISLATURE WHICH THEY WERE REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH ALL OF THE- EMPLOYMENT LAWS WHICH APPLY TO CALIFORNIA PRIVATE SECTOR BUSINESSES. NOW AND I HOPE YOU KNOW THERE ARE A LOT OF EMPLOYMENT LAWS IN% CALIFORNIA SO IN MY TWO MINUTES I'M ONLY GOING TO BE ABLE TO FOCUS ON IF YOU. FOR EXAMPLE LABOR CODE TWO TWO SIX WAGE STATEMENTS. INCLUDE NINE SEPARATE ITEMS EVEN IF AN EMPLOYEE IS FULLY PAID ON TIME EVERY SINGLE NICKEL THEY ARE- ONE SMALL CARE ON A WAGE STATEMENT CAN LEAD TO SEVERE MONETARY PENALTIES. THE CO TWO TO SEVEN POINT THREE THE FINAL PAYCHECK MUST BE ACCURATE IF THE FINALS PROJECT ONE PENNY SHORT. WAITING TIME PENALTIES OF UP TO THIRTY TIMES THE DAILY WAGE RATES CAN BE IN CARL. MAIL AND REST BREAKS BECAUSE NEIL IS SCHEDULED ONE MINUTE TOO LATE IN THE WORKING ANY PREMIUM OF ONE HOUR OKAY NEEDS TO BE PROVIDED. IT'S NOT JUST A LOT HOW TO BAIL HIM FORCE PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACT LOG. LET'S TAKE AN EXAMPLE CLAIMS THAT THE EMPLOYEES GOT THEIR MEAL BREAKS TOO LATE AND THEY DID NOT GET THEIR ONE OUR PREMIUM PAY. ALL OF THEIR LEAD STATEMENTS WILL ALSO INCORRECT ALL THOSE WHO. IMPLEMENT THERE WAS AN ERROR ON THEIR FINAL PAYCHECK YOU NEED TO THIRTY DAYS TO PAY FOR WAITING TIME PENALTIES. ALLOWS FOR THE STACKING AND STACKING AND STACKING OF MULTIPLE PENALTIES BASED ON ONE SINGLE PAYER. NEEDS LAWS AND OTHERS. DO NOT APPLY TO THE LEGISLATURE. IN UNDER OF THE- A COMMUNITY I MOST BILLS. WOULD RATHER INCOME LAW THE FOR. RATHER THAN COMPOSED THESE LAW ON THE WAY. TO THAT END I GET RID INTO RECORD OF OUR PLANS. TO THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND GIVES IMPACT THE- EARLIER THIS YEAR IN WHICH WE DESCRIBE THE COR POINT WHAT CHRIST CONTROL. BECAUSE MAURICE OF THE STAGGER EMPLOYEE WATCH FACED BY THE- HERE IN THE GOLD. AND WHICH WE OFFERS. FOR RANDOM SARGEANT BRING YOU YOUR TIME AND TESTIMONY. THANK YOU SIR. ALL RIGHT. NOT ANYONE THE GALA IN SUPPORT. ANYONE ONE TWELVE SEEING NONE MISTER THE PHONE.

AND WE HAVE NO ONE IN OPPOSITION ALL RIGHT LET ME MAKE SURE THERE'S NO IN THE-GALLERY ANYONE THE GALLERY IN OPPOSITION ANYONE IN ROOM ONE TWELVE NO. ALL RIGHT- I SEE CENTER LAYERS MICROPHONES ON CENTER LAYERED. ONE SENATOR ALSO AS WELL. SOMEBODY THERE WE GO THANK YOU- I JUST WANTED TO KNOWLEDGE THAT- THE SENATOR DOLLY MENTIONED THAT. THIS IS HIS FIRST BILL IN EIGHT YEARS AND JUDICIARY AND WHEN THIS BILL APPEARED IN THE LABOR COMMITTEE IT WAS THE FIRST TIME IN EIGHT YEARS HE HAD APPEARED IN FRONT OF THE LABOR COMMITTEE. AND WE WERE VERY CAREFUL AT THAT MEETING TO EXTEND HIS IMAGE INVITATION TO THE ANNUAL MAY DAY PICNIC THAT IS NOW GOING TO BE AT THE BEEPER RANCH OF SENATOR DOLLY AND THEN I'VE FURTHER HAVE INFORMATION THAT IF YOU HAVE A PICKET LINE IN YOUR DISTRICT YOU SHOULD CHECK FOR HIS AVAILABILITY HE HE MIGHT JOIN I THINK HE'S READY TO CO AUTHOR PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENTS. AND WE WOULD JUST REALLY LIKE TO WELCOME OUR BROTHER TO THE FOLD. SO IN THAT BILL GOT A TO KNOW SUSPECTED HIT. THAT THAT DIDN'T ONLY. ON LIKE AN OFFER SENATE FOR ARE- THE SENATE THERE ARE. I HAVE I HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE AUTHOR A DOES THIS IN TERMS OF EXTENDING RIGHTS OF FROM THE PRIVATE SECTOR- INCLUDE THE RIGHT TO COLLECTIVELY BARGAIN. IN THIS IN THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION ACTUALLY OWN IT IS MAYBE GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT MORE INFORMATION I KNOW IT'S BEEN A LONG DAY FOR ALL BUT- I DON'T THINK PEOPLE REALLY TOOK ME SERIOUS WHEN I FIRST RAN THIS BILL YOU KNOW- IN THE IN THE- I DIDN'T GET MUCH FEEDBACK FROM THE COMMITTEES- FROM THE CONSULTANTS AND I WAS HOPING THAT I WOULD. HAVE A LITTLE MORE- WHEN I FOUND OUT A COUPLE YEARS BACK- THAT OUR EMPLOYEES DIDN'T GET THE SAME THINGS I GIVE TO MY OWN EMPLOYEES. I WAS APPALLED QUITE FRANKLY BECAUSE WE DO WORK LONG HOURS HERE AND I THINK THAT AND WE ALSO HEAR. A LOT OF SPEECHES ON THE FLOOR ABOUT HOW WE'RE PRO THE WORKING PERSON WHICH BIG SEVERAL LAWS AND I AND SO. I ALSO. KNOW HOW BURDENS IT IS TO DO THE LAWS THAT ARE PASSED IN THE LEGISLATURE. SO TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION. I REALLY HAVEN'T HAD A LOT OF FOLKS WORKING WITH ME ON THIS BILL I'VE BEEN KIND OF ON MY OWN. BECAUSE I THINK THEY THOUGHT IT WAS LIKE A STATEMENT OR SOMETHING BUT I AM VERY SERIOUS ABOUT THIS BILL I THINK IT IS. THE RIGHTEOUS THING TO DO FOR THOSE LOW DEFINITELY I LEARNED IN THIS JUST FROM THE LAST COMMITTEE ABOUT. THE DOUBLE THE TO THE BILL WHICH YOU ACTUALLY ASK ME THAT QUESTION AND I DID NOT KNOW THE ANSWER I FOUND THAT ANSWER OUT- SINCE THEN SO IT'S DOUBLE THE WEIGHT I DID NOT. I'M NOT GOING AFTER COLLECTIVE BARGAINING I'M I KNOW THAT. MOST PUBLIC AGENCIES HAVE THAT. SO IN THIS BILL I JUST QUITE FRANKLY REALLY. IT REALLY MAINLY FOCUSED ON THE- THE- THE PROP SIXTY FIVE I MEAN. I BROUGHT IT UP A COUPLE YEARS AGO THE BOTTLES THAT ARE ON OUR DESK AND HAVE. THE HAND SANITIZER ADAM WAS AN EXAMPLE I USE THAT IN MY BUSINESS I WOULD HAVE TO LABEL THAT SO THAT THE- EMPLOYER. EMPLOYEES WOULD KNOW. WHAT'S IN THAT BOTTLE NOW WE ALL KNOW WHAT'S HAND SANITIZER. BUT TO THE LETTER OF THE LAW WHICH MY WITNESS TALKED ABOUT. YOU COULD BE SUED IS AN EMPLOYER IF YOU DON'T HAVE THAT LABEL ON THERE AND IT ACTUALLY CAUSED. HARM TO EMPLOYEES. SO THOSE AND THE AND THE OVERTIME IS I THOUGHT I WOULD BE. ASKED AS AT THE COMMITTEES TO NARROW DOWN OVER TIME BECAUSE TAT'S REALLY SOMETHING THAT WE- DESPERATELY NEED TO DO SO I HAVE BEEN ASKING BEEN KIND ON MY OWN HERE- AND I THINK IT WOULD BE GREAT BECAUSE A LOT OF THE LEGISLATORS. WHO ARE IN THE BUILDING. DON'T RUN BUSINESSES AND DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT IT IS TO GO THROUGH IT AND THE RELATIONSHIP WE HAVE THEIR PLACE WITHOUT THE GOAL OF THIS BILL. I DID NOT BUT IN PART A BARGAINING UNITS I KNOW THAT'S BEEN TRIED IN THE PAST. AND IN THE IN THE ASSEMBLY. IT WAS TRIED I KNOW WHEN I THINK YOU THE BILL GOT TO APPROACH AND DIDN'T GET OUT SO. THAT STATE YOUR BILL NO I DID NOT INCLUDE THAT IN THIS BILL I WAS JUST QUITE FRANKLY TRYING TO. ADDRESS THE INEQUITIES THAT WE HAVE. WITH MAINLY THOSE LOWER PLATE EMPLOYEES WHO DO WORK LONG HOURS AT A CERTAIN TIME AND THEN. TO ALSO BE AFFORDED THE SAME RIGHTS UNDER- THE ASBESTOS IN THIS BUILDING IS SOMETHING THAT I KNOW. I ASKED A- THE- ONE OF THE EMPLOYEES OF THE OF THE ASSEMBLY WOMAN DOLLIES IF THEY'D HAD. ANY CONTACT FROM. THE HR DEPARTMENT AND THEY DID SO HE THEY SENT ME SOMETHING THAT. WAS COVERED FROM DEBRA GAVE IT ABOUT. NAILING THINGS IN THE WALL BECAUSE- IN CERTAIN PARTS OF THE HOUSE THERE ARE. HARMFUL THINGS AND SAID WAS A- I DID SEE AN EMAIL THAT CAME OUT SO I'VE I'VE BEEN TRYING TO GATHER INFORMATION ON BECAUSE WE DO APPLY TO A LOT OF THE LAWS WE DO WE APPLIED A LOT OF THE LAWS OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT I WAS ON THE COMMITTEE FOR THAT. WE DO THOSE SO- THAT'S KIND OF ANSWER QUESTION MAYBE. PLEASE THANK YOU SENATE ALI ALL RIGHT OTHER QUESTIONS. OTHER QUESTIONS- CYNICAL EUROPE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- SENATOR DOLLY I'M I'M GOING TO SUPPORT YOUR BILL TODAY I. THE CHALLENGE I HAVE IS I HAVE BEEN IN AN EMPLOYER AND SUB AND FRANKLY I REALLY THINK WHAT WOULD BE A REAL GOOD THING TO DO IS GO THROUGH THE LABOR CODE AND TO TRY TO PULL OUT THE DIMINISH KIND OF- OF. ERRORS THAT CAN OCCUR IN ANY ENVIRONMENT THAT ARE NOT DONE- ON PURPOSE- NUMBER ONE NUMBER TWO IS TO SET UP A PROCESS WHERE IF YOU FOLLOW STATE ADVISEMENT FROM THE LABOR COMMISSIONER ABOUT HOW YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO CALCULATE INFORMATION AND IT ENDS UP THAT YOU THE COURT DETERMINES THAT YOU'VE BEEN CALCULATING WRONG BECAUSE YOU DID YOU RELIED ON THE STATE ADVISEMENT. THEN I THINK THERE OUGHT TO BE A GOOD HARBOR- OF SAFE HARBOR FROM THOSE KINDS OF- ERRORS AND- SO MY CONCERN IS TO PUT. THE TO MAKE. TO JUST COMPOUND THE PROBLEM BY BY BY HAVING THE LEGISLATURE- DO ABIDE BY THE SAME RULES I GET YOUR POINT- SOME OF THE SUPPORT SUPPORTED TODAY BUT- BUT IT IS- IRONIC THAT THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT WE- THAT WE DID WELL WE LEGISLATE- THAT REALLY ARE DE MINIMUS AND IT BECOMES DIFFICULT AND SO. WITH THIS BILL WE CAN NO LONGER HAVE EMPLOYEES EATING AT THEIR DESK AND WILL HAVE TO SEND THEM OUT OF THE BUILDING IN ORDER FOR HER SOMEWHERE IN A- IN THE CAN AND HAVE. PLAY WHERE PEOPLE CAN EAT. IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE NOT EATING AT THEIR DESK BECAUSE IT IS A VIOLATION OF THE LAW TO HAVE YOUR EMPLOYEES EATING AT THEIR DESK EVEN IF THEY WANT TO DO THAT AND THAT'S WHAT THEY FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH. SO BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU ASK FOR SO I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO TODAY IN THE POINT YOU'RE MAKING. WELL I WOULD JUST SAY THAT- THAT'S EXACTLY MY POINT TO ALL OF US EMPLOYERS IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR WHO QUITE FRANKLY ARE NOT AT ODDS WITH OUR EMPLOYEES WE'RE ACTUALLY WE'RE PARTNERS. AND I MENTIONED THAT MANY TIMES ON THIS FLOOR THAT YOU KNOW YES THERE'S A FEW BAD ACTORS OUT THERE BUT THE MAJORITY OF THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN PRIVATE. LAWYERS AND THEIR EMPLOYEES ARE NOT BAD THERE THERE'S A TWO WAY STREET AND WE NEED THEM THEY NEED US AND WE'RE A FAMILY. BUT I WILL TELL YOU JUST WAS. WHAT YOUR YOUR O YOUR POINT IS THAT YOU GET A TRIAL ATTORNEY OR A LABOR ATTORNEY. YOU CAN TURN INTO LAKEPORT SOME DISGRUNTLED EMPLOYEE AND ALL SAID YOU'RE OUT OF BUSINESS BECAUSE THE LAWS ARE WRITTEN TO THAT STRICT AMOUNT IT DOESN'T MATTER IT'S JUST LIKE THE PARKING LOT IF YOU. PAID IN POINT THEY GOT PAID THEIR TOTAL WEIGHT BUT YOU HAD THE DATE WRONG ON THE CHECK YOU'RE LIABLE FOR. UP A TON OF MONEY I MEAN UP TO SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT. AND WHO GETS THE MONEY. NOTHING PLOY. THE TOURNEY'S AT. THE END OF THE DAY THAT'S TO REALLY WORKS OUT SO- I'M I'M I WILL. BE HAPPY TO LOOK AT THIS BILL IF I GET OTHERS COMMITTEE AND MAYBE TIED IT UP A LITTLE BIT- BUT- REALLY. WE SHOULD IF IT CAN YOU IMAGINE IF THE LEGISLATORS GOT SUED BY THE EMPLOYEE AND A POCKET CAME IN OR THE GOT THE RULES COMMITTEE GOT SUED. MAYBE WOULD BRING SOME LIGHT TO THE- TO SOME OF THE THINGS WHERE WE SHOULD HAVE A LITTLE MORE COMMON SENSE AND MAYBE A LITTLE MORE GRAYSON PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO. PROVIDE JOBS ON A TWO WAY STREET SO I APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS AND I WOULD. LOOK AT NARROWING DOWN MY BILL TO MAKE IT MORE WORKABLE. THANK YOU SENATE GONZALEZ THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND- THANK YOU SENATOR DOLLY FOR BRINGING THIS pBECAUSE I WAS. YOU KNOW I'M STILL A LITTLE UNCLEAR AS TO WHAT SORT OF TYPES OF SITUATIONS AND IT'S- STATED IN THE ANALYSIS PAGE FOR. THE PARAGRAPH THAT SPARKS- FOR ME IS THE PROBLEM IS THAT THIS BILL DRAWS NO DISTINCTION BETWEEN SITUATIONS AS AS I MENTIONED IT WHICH IT MIGHT MAKE POLICY SENSE TO TREAT LEGISLATIVE EMPLOYEES DIFFERENTLY. IT SWEEPS UP ALL EMPLOYMENT LAWS APPLICABLE TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND DUMP THEM ON THE LEGISLATURE WITHOUT TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION- SUCH MOVE SO. I'LL I'M HAPPY TO VOTE YES BECAUSE I LIKE THE WAY THIS DIALOGUE IS TURNING OUT- BUT I'D LIKE TO SEE WHERE YOU CAN TIGHTEN IT UP AND CREATE SITUATIONS- OUTSIDE OF- WHERE WE ALREADY ALIGN WITH THE PRIVATE SECTOR. AND WHERE THE GAPS ARE- AS YOU KNOW AND IT SEEMS LIKE YOU'RE GONNA BE DOING THAT SO. HAPPY TO SUPPORT TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU ALREADY- C. NO OTHER MIKE- IS THERE A MOTION. SIR JOHN'S MOST THE BILL ALL RIGHT. SENATE ALI CARE CLOSE I DO I JUST WANNA SAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE CONVERSATION I WILL LOOK INTO THOSE- I WOULD BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO HAVE SOME HELP I HAVEN'T HAD MUCH ALONG THE WAY BUT I DO KNOW SOME OF THE THINGS I WANT TO WORK O AND IT IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO FOR.

B. SEVEN TWO SEVEN BY SENATOR LEYVA. I'M GOING TO THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR THINKING MEMBERS THANK YOU SENATOR GONZALEZ I MUCH APPRECIATE THAT. GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS I WOULD LIKE TO THANK MISTER CHAIR AND THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR TAKING THE TIME TO WORK WITH ME ON THIS BILL. AND TO THAT END I WILL BE TAKING THE AMENDMENTS OUTLINED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS WHICH ALL OF YOU SHOULD HAVE. SB SEVEN TWO SEVEN AIMS TO PREVENT WAIT STAFF WITHIN THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY. I WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT WE ARE SEEKING TO GO AFTER THE BAD ACTORS IN THE INDUSTRY. AND TO HELP THOSE THAT PLAY BY THE RULES AND MAKE SURE THAT THEIR WORKERS ARE PAID BACK ON TIME. AND HELP THEM. CALIFORNIA'S CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY BUILT OUR WORLD CROSS CLASS INFRASTRUCTURE IS A KEY DRIVER OF THE STATE'S ECONOMY AND PROVIDED HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF HOUSING UNITS ANNUALLY. TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF GROWING CALIFORNIA POPULATION. DUE TO THE SKILLS REQUIRED IN THE FAIR WAGES AND BENEFITS WORKERS RECEIVED THE INDUSTRY PROVIDED A PATHWAY TO THE MIDDLE CLASS. FOR TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CONSTRUCTION WORKERS WHO COULD THEN AFFORD TO PURCHASE THE HOMES THAT THEY BUILT. UNFORTUNATELY FOR MORE THAN THE LAST FORTY YEARS THOSE STANDARDS HAVE BEEN GRADUALLY ERODING. ORDING TO THE UNITED STATES OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT CRITERIA OVER 50% OF CALIFORNIA'S CONSTRUCTION WORK FORCE FAMILIES CURRENTLY FALL IN THE LOW INCOME CATEGORY. LESS THAN 80% OF MEDIAN FAMILY INCOME. AND OVER ONE THIRD OF ALL CONSTRUCTION FAMILIES ARE CLASSIFIED AS VERY LOW INCOME LESS THAN 50% OF THE MEDIAN FAMILY INCOME. LIKE MANY OTHER SECTORS CONSTRUCTION WAGES HAVE GONE DOWN BUT WAGE THEFT AND CASH PAYMENTS HAVE INCREASED. AND A KEY FACTOR FOR THIS IS THE LACK OF ENFORCEMENT OF BASIC LABOR LAWS ON JOBSITES. UNSCRUPULOUS CONTRACTORS TO DO NOT PLAY BY THE RULES HAVE BEEN ILLEGAL AND UNFAIR ADVANTAGE OVER ON ITS CONTRACTORS AS THE UNDERMINE WAGES AND WORKING CONDITIONS THROUGHOUT THE INDUSTRY. LABOR SHORTAGES CONSTRUCTION OUR LARGER CLIENTS CONCENTRATED IN THE LOW WAGE UNDERGROUND ECONOMY SECTORS OF THE INDUSTRY. I WILL NOT GO INTO ALL OF THE DETAIL AS TO WHY THAT IS DANNY CURTAIN WHO'S HERE WITH ME TODAY WILL DO THAT. BUT I WILL SHARE THAT WHILE S. B. EXCUSE ME AB SEVENTEEN OH ONE BY THURMOND. WHICH TOOK EFFECT IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN HAS MADE SOME DIFFERENCE IT HAS NOT DONE ENOUGH OR GONE FAR ENOUGH. SOME CONTRACTORS STILL CONSIDER WAGE THEFT JUST A COST OF DOING BUSINESS. COLLEAGUES AT THIS TIME THAT WE TREAT WAGE THEFT IN THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY SIMILAR. TO HOW WE DO IN OTHER INDUSTRIES. SB TWO SO WILL PROVIDE NECESSARY ENFORCEMENT TOOLS TO EFFECTIVELY DETER CONTINUED WAGE THAT BY MAKING SURE THAT DIRECT CONTRACTORS. NO LONGER IGNORE THE VIOLATIONS OF THE SUBCONTRACTORS THEY HIRED TO BUILD THEIR PROJECTS HERE WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY% IN SUPPORT IS THE ANY CURTAIN WITH THE CALIFORNIA CONFERENCE OF CARPENTERS. AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME MEMBERS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU SIR LEYVA AYE SEEMS TO CURTAIN UP IN THE GALLERY DISCOURAGING THE GALLERIES YEARS. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN THANK YOU SIMILAR. FIRST OF ALL I THINK THIS FOR IS SIXTY TWO BY OF THE DAY. ADDRESS A JOINT LAW. ISSUE THE GARMENT INDUSTRY. SB SEVEN TWO SEVEN EXPANSE THAT SAME DIRECT CONTRACTOR JOINT LIABILITY TO INCLUDE PENALTIES LIQUIDATED DAMAGES AND INTEREST. FOR SUBCONTRACTOR. VIOLATIONS IN THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY. S. THE LATEST OVER 4% OF THE COUNTRY WORK FORCES YOU TO LOW VERY LOW OR- LOW AND- OVER THIRD ALMOST THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND WORKERS ARE BELOW THE CALIFORNIA POVERTY STANDARD. OVER 85% OF THOSE WORKERS ARE PEOPLE OF COLOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF THEM LATINO. OVER THE LAST FOUR DECADES CONSTRUCTION WAGES HAVE BEEN FLAT AND ACTUALLY DROP IN THE LOWER HALF OF THE INDUSTRY THAT SAME AT THE SAME TIME THE UNDERGROUND ECONOMY HAS INCREASED OVER FOUR HUNDRED PERCENT. ALMOST 20% OF THE CONSTRUCTION WORKFORCE ARE EITHER OFF THE BOOKS WERE MISCLASSIFIED. WHEN THE UNDERGROUND UNDERGROUND GOES UP WORKERS WE JUST DOWN. CALIFORNIA STATE LAY LAW. IS ONE. THE OTHER HAVING A JOB SITE. RANGE ONCE IN THREE HUNDRED BY THE LABOR CAN. OR ONCE IN THREE THAT YEARS BY THE MULTI AGENCY JOINT ENFORCEMENT STRIKE FORCE. AN ESTIMATED TWENTY MILLION. TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS IN WAGES GOES UNREPORTED. IN THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY CRIME DOES PAY. OPPONENTS OF THIS BILL SUGGEST WE NEED MORE LABOR LAW ENFORCEMENT THAT'S ONE PLACE WE AGREE THAT AVOIDS THE REAL ISSUE OF RESPONSIBILITY. THE GENERAL CONTRACTOR IS TOTALLY RESPONSIBLE AND LIABLE FOR THE COMPLETION OF THE JOB THE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CONSTRUCTION THEY'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR LONG TERM LATENT DEFECT LIABILITY THERE ARE ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR ENFORCING SAFETY ON THE ENTIRE JOB. NO BLAMING THE SUBCONTRACTORS THERE THE SINGLE ENTITY THAT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR CONTROLLING THE PROJECT IN THE ONE ENTITY THAT HAS THE TOOLS TO DO SO. WE TAKEN MAJOR. TO MAKE SURE CONTRACTOR ARE ONLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE THINGS THEY CAN MONITOR. OPPONENTS SAID THEY COULDN'T MONITOR UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE PAYMENTS AND WORKERS COMP PREMIUMS. THEY WILL RIGHT. SO WE DROPPED THOSE ISSUES FROM THE BILL NOT BECAUSE THERE ISN'T RAMPANT ABUSE BUT BECAUSE THEY CAN'T BE MONITORED BY THE GENERAL CONTRACTOR. WE'VE ADDED IMPORTANT LANGUAGE MODELED ON PUBLIC WORKS CONSTRUCTION LOG THAT RELIEVES THE GENERAL CONTRACTOR OF LIABILITIES FOR PENALTIES. THE SUBCONTRACTOR PAYROLLS AND DILIGENTLY TAKE CORRECTIVE ACTION TO HALT OR RECTIFY THE FAILURE. NOW OPPONENTS ARE SAYING IT BE A NICE TO ME THE- ACTUALLY IT'S DONE ALL THE TIME IN THE UPPER HALF OF THE CAN. IN THE NIGHTMARE FOR ON THE SUB OF THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND CONSTRUCTION WORKERS WHOSE FAMILIES LIVE IN POVERTY. IN SPITE OF A FULL TIME JOB IN WHAT USED TO BE A PATHWAY TO THE MIDDLE CLASS. THIS IS NOT A WAGE BILL THAT DOES NOT CALL FOR HIGHER WAGES IT'S A WAGE THEFT BILL IT'S A PLAY BY THE RULES BILL THE RULES AND LAWS THAT ALREADY EXIST. UNLESS THERE IS A FINANCIAL PENALTY FOR NOT PLAYING BY THE RULES THE LAW IS SIMPLY A SUGGESTION. CONTRACTORS KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT THEY'LL BE NO MORE LOOKING THE OTHER WAY WHILE SUBCONTRACTORS PLAY FAST AND LOOSE. HONEST CONTRACTORS IN THE BOTTOM HALF OF THE INDUSTRY ESPECIALLY START UP CONTRACTORS COMPETE IN THE WILD WEST ENVIRONMENT. WHERE THEY HAVE TO SQUEEZE THEIR WORKERS HARDER OR THEY START CUTTING CORNERS WITH THE RULES. IF THERE IS A CHURCH SHORTAGE OF WORKERS IN RESIDENTIAL INDUSTRY IT'S BECAUSE WORKERS PARTICULARLY YOUNG WORKERS SEE NO FUTURE IN HARD DIRTY WORK THAT PAYS POVERTY WAGES. I ASK YOU TO KEEP THIS IN MIND AS YOU CONTINUE TO PUSH FOR MORE DESPERATELY NEEDED HOUSING. THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF WORKERS WHO ARE ALSO IN DESPERATE NEED. THIS BILL IS START I WANNA THANK SENATE LABOR TAKING THIS CHALLENGE SB SEVEN TWO SEVEN IS TELLING THE PRIVATE SECTOR IT'S O'CLOCK TIME TO CLEAN UP YOUR INDUSTRY. I JUST AN ASIDE MR I WOULD LIKE THANK THIS. WHEN YOU'RE OUTSIDE THIS MAKING FOR ESPECIALLY UNDER PANDEMIC. IT'S A TO FORGET OR UNDER.

A CENTER GLAZER PRESENCE SB SEVEN FOUR FOUR SURVEYS THE FLOOR IS YOURS THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS I APPRECIATE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT SENATE BILL SEVEN FORTY FOUR THIS BILL PROPOSES MODEST CHANGES TO THE WAY THE STATE GATHERS AND SHARES INFORMATION TO FIGHT THE SPREAD OF INFECTIOUS DISEASE. AS YOU KNOW MORE THAN A YEAR INTO THE PANDEMIC WE STILL HAVE VERY LITTLE SCIENCE THAT EXPLAINS HOW THE VIRUS THAT CAUSES COBIT NINE HAS SPREAD. NOW GOOD SCIENCE DEPENDS ON GOOD DATA AND WE HAVE UNFORTUNATELY VERY LITTLE DATA. EVEN THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH HAS A SYSTEM FOR SHARING DATA WITH BONA FIDE. UNIVERSITY RESEARCHERS. NOT A SINGLE STUDY MEMBERS NOT A SINGLE STUDY WAS PUBLISHED IN TWENTY TWENTY. BASED ON THE INFORMATION GLEANED FROM THE NEARLY. THREE POINT SEVEN MILLION CASES. OF COVERT NINETEEN HERE IN CALIFORNIA. THE SITUATION IS BUT ARE ESSENTIAL WORKERS AND MOST VULNERABLE RESIDENTS AT EVEN GREATER RISK. THIS BILL COULD CHANGE THAT. BY GATHERING BETTER DATA AND MAKING IT EASIER FOR RESEARCHERS TO USE FIRST WE WOULD GATHER MORE DATA ON HOUSING WORKPLACE ENTRAPMENT WHICH WE BELIEVE TO BE A MAJOR SOURCES SPREAD. THEN WE WOULD IMPROVE OUR EXISTING SYSTEM FOR SHARING DATA WITH RESEARCHERS BY CREATING A FAST LANE TO ALLOW THEM TO SEE DATA IN REAL TIME WHEN THEIR ANALYSIS IS MOST NEEDED. TO INFORM BETTER POLICY. WE WOULD DO THIS. WHILE LEAVING IN PLACE ALL OF THE EXISTING PROTECTIONS FOR PERSONAL PRIVACY. WHICH IN CALIFORNIA ARE PROBABLY THE STRONGEST IN THE COUNTRY. MEMBERS WE HAVE LOST MORE THAN SIXTY THOUSAND FELLOW CALIFORNIANS TO THIS DEADLY VIRUS. WE CAN'T GO BACK AND APPLY THE LESSONS WE LEARNED TO SAVE THOSE LIVES. WE CAN APPLY THOSE LESSONS TO THE FUTURE AND WE SHOULD. I KNOW WE'RE GOING TO HEAR A MOMENT FROM SOME OPPOSITION FROM PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER COMMUNITY WONDERFUL PEOPLE DOING GREAT WORK FOR US I'LL BE HAPPY TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS THEY'VE RAISED A LITTLE BIT LATER HEARING IF THE MEMBERS WOULD LIKE. WITH ME TO EXPLAIN THE ROLE THE DATA PLAYS IN FIGHTING DISEASE AND HOW CALIFORNIA CURRENTLY PERFORMS ON THAT SCORE IS DR JEFFREY CLARK LISNER FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA KECK SCHOOL OF MEDICINE. THANK YOU SENATOR GLAZERS CONTACT CLOSER YOU ONLINE. I AM THANK YOU THE FLOOR IS YOURS. HI MY NAME IS DR JEFFREY KLAUSNER PRACTICING INFECTIOUS DISEASE PHYSICIAN MEDICAL EPIDEMIOLOGIST AND PROFESSOR OF PREVENTIVE MEDICINE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. I AM A FORMER COUNTY DEPUTY HEALTH OFFICER FOR OVER TWELVE YEARS AND FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA STD CONTROLLERS ASSOCIATION AS BEING IN STRONG SUPPORTER SENATE BILL SEVEN FOUR FOUR WHICH WOULD ADD. NEW DATA ELEMENTS TO COMMUNICABLE RESPIRATORY DISEASE REPORTING AND REQUIRE THE STATE TO SECURELY SHARE DE IDENTIFIED DATA TO ENABLE CALIFORNIA BASED ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS TO PERFORM EPIDEMIOLOGIC ANALYSIS. CALIFORNIA PUBLIC HEALTH RESPONSE TO CALL THE NINETEEN HAS BEEN AN ABJECT FAILURE. NEARLY SIXTY THOUSAND US TWO THIRDS DURING DISADVANTAGED POPULATIONS A COLOR ISSUE LAST EXTRACELLULAR THE CONTINUED SCHOOL CLOSURES IN SOME AREAS AND SEVERE ECONOMIC LOSS AMONG THE MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. THAT CAN CONTRIBUTE TO THAT FAILURE HAS BEEN THE POOR USE OF EPIDEMIOLOGIC DATA AN INABILITY OF THE STATE TO USE AVAILABLE DATA TO CREATE A TARGETED RESPONSE TO FOCUS INTERVENTIONS TO LIMIT THE COLLATERAL DAMAGE CAUSED BY BROAD BASED. STATEWIDE POLICIES BECAUSE OF DECADES OF FUNDING CUTS TO THE STATE DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH THIS STATE HAS LIMITED CAPACITY TO ANALYZE COLLECTED DATA FURTHERMORE THE DATA COLLECTED ARE INCOMPLETE AND INSUFFICIENT TO SUPPORT SCIENCE BASS RESPONSE. EXAMPLE THAT FAILURE WHERE THE INDISCRIMINATE CLOSURE OF OUTDOOR SPACES BEACHES PLAYGROUNDS AND THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF UNFOUNDED INTERVENTIONS LIKE DEEP% CLEANING ACTIVITIES ON THE FLIP SIDE THE LACK OF GOOD DATA RESULTED IN THE NEGLECT. OF ESSENTIAL WORKERS AND THE FAILURE TO IMPLEMENT TESTING IN THE WORK FORCE WHICH COULD HAVE IDENTIFIED EARLY CASES IMPLEMENTED THE FOR THE SPREAD OF INFECTION. SENATE BILL SEVEN FOUR FOUR WOULD BE A STEP TOWARD RIGHTING THE STATE'S DEL PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM BY ADDING HOLDEN RESPIRATORY DISEASE EXPOSURE ELEMENT. I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT COLLECTING THE ADDED TO THE ELEMENTS ARE NOT. A BURDEN TO PRACTICING CLINICIAN IN FACT IT DOCTOR ARE TAUGHT TO GO THOSE. ARE KEEPING WRK HOW TYPE TO TRAVEL. IN MEDICAL SCHOOL.

IN CALIFORNIA BOTH THE HEALTH OFFICERS MONITOR THE HEALTH OF THEIR COMMUNITIES WHICH IS ONE OF THEIR FIRST DUTIES AND A PRIMARY TOOL FOR DOING THIS IS DISEASE REPORTING USING TITLE SEVENTEEN WHICH REQUIRES HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS TO LET US KNOW WHEN THE SCENE ONE OF THE CASES. EIGHTY EIGHT IS THE- BUT WE KNOW THAT ALL FOR. REPORT AND CASE THEY MIGHT FORGET WHERE THEY MIGHT THINK IT'S TOO MUCH TROUBLE. SO TO KEEP THE SYSTEM RUNNING SMOOTHLY WE TRY TO MAKE SURE IT IS SIMPLE AND CONFIDENTIAL AND- WE WANT TO REMOVE BARRIERS TO DISEASE REPORTING. THIS BILL WILL ADD MORE QUESTIONS TO BE ASKED BY THE MEDICAL PROVIDER. TO PEOPLE WHO HAVE TWENTY ONE AND THE IN EIGHTY EIGHT AND- NOT ALL THE QUESTIONS ARE APPROPRIATE FOR EACH CITY BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY IT ADDS AND BARRIER IT MAY END UP HARMING DATA COLLECTION RATHER THAN HELPING IT BECAUSE THE MORE QUESTIONS WE REQUIRE PROVIDERS TO ASK.

A BIRD **** THIS- THIS HEARING BUT I WANT TO BE ON I WANT I pWANT TO BE ASKED TO BE A CO AUTHOR- I AM FLABBERGASTED. THAT I THINK ALL THE PARTICIPANTS BUT I'M FLABBERGASTED THAT AT ANY PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIAL WOULD SAY. WE DON'T WANT TO ASK THESE QUESTIONS- WHEN THEY COULD SAVE LIVES LET ME JUST TELL YOU THAT IT WAS ABSOLUTELY PREDICTABLE. THAT FARMWORKERS WERE GONNA END UP ON THE FRONT LINES. FEELING THE BRUNT OF THIS VIRUS AND IT WAS PREDICTABLE BECAUSE OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THEIR HOUSING THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THEIR TRAVEL AND THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THEIR- WORK ENVIRONMENT WE ARE PASSING LEGISLATION IT'S GOING TO HOLD EMPLOYERS. RESPONSIBLE AND LIABLE FOR KNOWING WHAT'S GOING ON IN THEIR WORKPLACE IN REGARDS TO THESE THESE KINDS OF PANDEMICS AND IF WE'RE GOING TO HOLD THEM RESPONSIBLE WE ALSO NEED TO HAVE DATA AND INFORMATION. SO THAT WE CAN SEE THINGS COMING AND PREPARE FOR IT AND MAYBE CHANGE THE WAY THAT WE DO. OUR WORK FROM A PUBLIC HEALTH PERSPECTIVE BEFORE THE PANDEMIC REACHES A CRISIS STAGE AND SO- I THINK THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT INFORMATION. IT'S FOUR SIMPLE QUESTIONS IF IT IF IT'S HARD TO BE ABLE TO GET THIS DATA WE'VE GOT TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE IT REALLY EASY IN THE DAY. IN THE DAYS. A DATA PRODUCTION I FIND IT HARD TO BELIEVE THAT WE CAN GET THIS INFORMATION TO PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS SO THEY CAN MAKE. THEY CAN CREATE A PREVENTATIVE SYSTEM SO WITH THAT I- I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THE BILL AND WHAT I'D LIKE TO BE ASKED AT ITS CO AUTHOR THANK% YOU- SENATE COVER EURO MOVES THE BILL THANK YOU CYNICAL EURO- OTHER. OTHER QUESTIONS YES- CENTER BORDERS. I TO JOIN MY- MY COLLEAGUE FROM SALINAS IN SUPPORT OF- THIS BILL. I THINK ONE OF THE SHOCKING MORE SHOCKING EXPERIENCES I HAD DURING THE PANDEMIC. WAS US FIGURING OUT AT THE LOCAL LEVEL THEREFORE TO THE STATE LEVEL. IS THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH VIABLE INFORMATION THAT WILL ALLOW US TO BETTER UNDERSTAND- TRANSMISSION RATES BASED UPON INDUSTRY SECTORS. THAT WAS TERRIBLY IMPORTANT AS WE WERE DEALING WITH CLOSING AND OPENING AND WATER PUBLIC HEALTH POLICIES WERE GOING TO BE AT THE STATE LEVEL. NOW I UNDERSTAND THIS OF COURSE WAS A COMPLICATED SITUATION BUT I THINK. ACCUMULATING THIS INFORMATION. THEN NOT HAVING A DISCLOSURE OF IDENTIFYING INFORMATION THAT WOULD IMPINGE ON SOMEONE'S PRIVACY IN MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THIS HAS ALL THOSE PROTECTIONS IN IT. THIS IS THE RIGHT. STEP FORWARD I'M I'M SURPRISED THAT WE DON'T HAVE SOMETHING LIKE THIS TO THE GREATEST EXTENT THAT IT'S NECESSARY- BUT I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT IT TODAY AND I THINK THIS IS- MORE ACTUAL PATH AS WE CUMULATE DATA FOR PUBLIC HEALTH PURPOSES. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR BORDERS OTHER MICROPHONES IF YOU'RE- NO OTHER MICROPHONES BEING RAISED US IN A COUPLE HEROES MOVE THE BILL- SENEGALESE- DID YOU ACCEPT THE MEMINTA SUGGESTED- AT. I DIDN'T- HI THERE A ACTUAL AMENDMENTS RECOMMENDED I KNOW THERE'S BEEN SOME GOOD TOMATOES TO THE RIVER MEMBERS PROPOSED ANALYSIS ON PAGES EIGHT NINE COMMON NUMBER THREE. SORRY STILL NOT SEEN WHAT WHERE YOU'RE REFERENCING MISTER CHAIRMAN. IT SAYS THE NET THE TOP OF THAT PAGE EIGHT THAT I'VE AGREED THAT TO AN AMENDMENT THAT LIMITS THE AVAILABILITY OF THE EXPEDITED PROCESS TO PERIODS WHEN THERE IS A CLEAR PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY THAT'S CORRECT THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE REFERENCING TO THAT THAT IS CORRECT THAT I THINK THAT. WAS INTENDED TO BE AMENDED INTO THE BILL BUT IF IT IS NOT THERE- THAT IS THE INTENTION ONLY A PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY- THIS BILL APPLICABLE ALL RIGHT THANK YOU. THANK THAT CLARIFIES THE CAMPARI CARE CLOSE I WOULD. HAVE BEEN A COUPLE FOR THE SICK COUPLE THINGS- FIRST- AS A MEMBERS NO- YOU KNOW WOULD BE VI&lt;c.cyan&gt; I&lt;/c&gt; DESIRE TO HAVE THIS BILL BE MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE THAN IT IS UP FOR YOU TODAY- BUT- GIVEN THE- THE PREVIOUS HEARING AND THE DISCUSSIONS TOOK PLACE THE BILL IS- IN A MORE LIMITED- FORM. SECONDLY THE SUGGESTION FROM MY GOOD FRIEND IN THE PUBLIC HEALTH COMMUNITY SAID THIS WOULD ADD QUESTIONS. TO THE- MORBIDITY REPORT I HAD THE MORBIDITY REPORT HERE. I WANT TO CLARIFY THAT THIS IS AN AD FOR QUESTIONS. IN THE MORBIDITY POOR REPORT AS AN EXAMPLE. IT ASKED THE QUESTION IS YOUR HOUSING STABLE OR UNSTABLE THAT'S THE QUESTION IN THERE. IT'S NOT A GOOD QUESTION FOR GATHERING DATA ON WHETHER SOMEONE IS IN CROWDED CONDITIONS. SO WHAT WE WOULD ASK OUR- THAT THE QUESTION. WHAT TYPE OF HOUSING IS THE PERSON LIVING AND WHAT'S THE SIZE OF THE HOUSEHOLD THAT'S AN EXAMPLE OF HOW WE CAN IMPROVE THIS MORBIDITY REPORT TO GET DATA THAT'S ACTUALLY USEFUL CROWDED CONDITIONS NOT WHETHER IT'S STABLE OR UNSTABLE SO I CAN GO AND EXPLAIN ON OCCUPATION AND TRAVEL THAT WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO TAKE EXISTING QUESTIONS IN THE REPORT AND MAKING THEM BETTER SO THEY'RE ACTUALLY USEFUL- SECONDLY THERE'S THE SUGGESTION. THIS CREATES A NEW EXPOSURES ON PRIVACY WE DON'T TOUCH THE PRIVACY PROTECTIONS IN CALIFORNIA IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM UNDER THIS BILL NOTHING. IS CHANGED. NOTHING IS CHANGED. FINALLY I WANT TO THANK THE SENATOR FROM A SALINAS FOR OFFERED A CO AUTHOR IN OTHERS WE APPRECIATE THAT SUPPORT AND WOULD BEHAPPY TO ADD THAT TO YOU THE BILL IF IT MOVES FORWARD WITH THAT MISTER CHAIRMAN I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU SENATOR GLAZERS A MOTION BY SENATOR CAFIERO MANAGING COUNSEL STARTED PLEASE CALL THE ROLL THIS IS SB SEVEN FORTY FOUR BY SENATOR GLAZER WITH THE MOTION BY SENATOR KERR YET ALL.

BASED COMPANIES BOTH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE- WITH- AT LEAST A BILLION DOLLARS IN ANNUAL REVENUE- WHO DO BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA THE REQUIRES THEM TO REPORT THEIR FULL CARBON FOOTPRINT- TO THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD. AFTER THIS DISCLOSURE CARPOOL BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE A REPORT ON THE CENTERPIECE OF THIS INFORMATION IS TRANSPARENT TO THE PUBLIC. THE REPORT WILL INCLUDE A ROAD MAP FOR NECESSARY CORPORATE EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS TO ALIGN WITH THE GOAL OF KEEPING GLOBAL WARMING LEVELS BELOW ONE POINT FIVE DEGREES CELSIUS- ABOVE PRE INDUSTRIAL LEVELS WHICH IS WHAT WE NEED. TO RUN A CATASTROPHE. OTHER POOR WILL ALSO INCLUDE REASONABLE ESTIMATES FOR TWENTY THIRTY AND TWENTY FORTY FIVE EMISSIONS LEVELS THAT CALIFORNIA'S CLIMATE AND CLEAN ENERGY GOALS ARE PROPERLY IMPLEMENTED. SB TWO SIXTY OF THE NECESSARY AND BOLD STEP FORWARD TO ENSURE THAT WE NOT ONLY HIT OUR CURRENT CLIMATE GOALS. BUT HAVE THE NECESSARY DATA AND INFORMATION TO SET NEW STANDARDS AND GOALS. ARE YOU CAN'T REGULATE WHAT YOU DON'T KNOW AND AS THE STATE CONTINUES TO CURB EMISSIONS ACROSS MANY SECTORS WE HAVE A CLEARER WE NEED TO HAVE A CLEAR IDEA OF WHAT WORKERS REMAINING. AND WHAT ACTION NEEDS TO BE TAKEN- THE SAME CANNOT BE SAID OF THE PRIVATE SECTOR CURRENTLY EMISSIONS REPORTING REQUIREMENTS ARE LIMITED TO LARGE- POINT SOURCE SUBMITTERS LEAVING OUT VAST SWATHS OF CORPORATE EMISSIONS. BY SOME COMPANIES VOLUNTARILY REPORT THEIR EMISSIONS. IT'S DIFFICULT TO BE CERTAIN OF THE REPORT'S VALIDITY- THERE ARE CORPORATIONS TO OFFER PARTIAL REPORTS- AND FRANKLY A TIMES MARKETING MATERIALS. WHICH CAN BE GREENWASHING WHEN IT'S NOT ACTUALLY GREEN BUT- WE REALLY DON'T KNOW BECAUSE THERE ARE NO LEGAL REQUIREMENTS TO FORMALLY REPORT AUDITED- CARBON EMISSIONS- SO SB TWO SIXTY WILL BRING CONSISTENCY AND TRANSPARENCY. OF OUR LARGEST CORPORATIONS- HAVE TO PUBLICLY DISCLOSE OUR CARBON FOOTPRINT AND HAS TO BE AUDITED AND WE WILL KNOW THAT. IT IS TRUE- REPORTING FALSE OF IMAGE HAS BECOME RECOGNIZED ON AS A NECESSITY FOR PROPERLY REDUCING EMISSIONS AND A SUCH ORGANIZATIONS- SUCH AS THE WORLD RESOURCES INSTITUTE HAVE DEVELOPED- THE GREENHOUSE GAS PROTOCOLS TO HELP MANAGERS PROPERLY REPORT. TO BE CLEAR WE'RE NOT WORKING FROM SCRATCH HERE THERE ARE EXISTING STRUCTURES- AND FORMULAS. THAT ALREADY EXISTS AND COMPANIES THAT ARE ALREADY DOING A VOLUNTARILY AND- THEY WON'T HAVE TO DO MUCH MORE WORK BECAUSE THEY'RE ALREADY. DOING IT AND COMPANIES WILL SIMPLY BE ABLE TO PLUG INTO THIS EXISTING. PROCESS ACCORDS FOCUS HERE ONCE COMPANIES ARE IN COMPLIANCE- AND REPORTING OF WILL BE TO ACTIVELY MAINTAIN UP TASTE OF PUBLICLY FACING WEBSITE DETAILING BEES. OUR CARBON FOOTPRINT REPORTS. ARKANSAS INVESTORS THE PUBLIC EVERYONE WILL THEN NO- WHICH NOT JUST WHICH BUSINESSES FOR WHICH SECTORS ARE A PROBLEM OR NOT A PROBLEM IN TERMS OF. A GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. SB TWO SIXTY IS THE NEXT CRITICAL STEP FOR CALIFORNIA. ON ITS- ON ITS JOURNEY TOWARDS TRUE CLIMATE ACTION UNDER SURE THAT OUR CORPORATE SECTOR AND OUR STATE OUR LINES IN OUR GOALS AND WORKING DILIGENTLY. WE NO LONGER HAVE A LUXURY TO ALLOW CORPORATIONS TO WORK BEHIND A CURTAIN EMITTING MORE MORE CARBON WHILE PROMISING CHANGE. SB TWO SIXTY PULLS BACK THE CURTAIN AND SHINES A FLOODLIGHT ONE ANY AND ALL POTENTIAL BAD ACTORS AND ALSO ON THE GOOD ACTORS WHO ARE TAKING CLIMATE CHANGE SERIOUSLY. I RESPECTFULLY FOR AND I.

I'M I'M- FIVE MOVING TOWARDS SUPPORT HI I HAD BY REMOVING THE CIVIL AND CRIMINAL PENALTIES THAT WAS A AMENDMENTS TODAY I KNOW THAT THAT WAS NOT EASY AND ALSO- THE ANALYSIS AND THEN- DORMANT COMMERCE CLAUSE ABOUT THE- COMPETITION I GUESS. YOU KNOW I'M I WANT TO BE HELPFUL AND I WANT THIS MEASURE TO BE HELPFUL AND I'M THINKING OF THE- BILLION DOLLAR CORPORATIONS WHO ARE STANDING ON THE SIDELINES AND WAITING. TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE LEADERSHIP OF CALIFORNIA'S GONNA SAY WHICH DIRECTION WE'RE GOING TO A MOVIE AND M. HAND HOW THEY CAN MERE MERE GOOD BEHAVIOR BECAUSE JUST THE MILLION DOLLAR BILLION DOLLAR CORPORATIONS IS NOT THE BIG PROBLEM WE'VE GOT. COUNTRIES LIKE CHINA THAT'S EMITTING 30% OF THE EMISSIONS AND WE GOT THE UNITED STATES WAS JUST GOT 15% MISSION SO A LOT OF THIS IS IT IS THE INTERNAL OF- PROBLEM- BUT- I GUESS IF WE MOVE ONE CORPORATION. BY HAVING THIS MESSAGE THEN WE'VE- BEEN WE'VE BEEN AN IMPROVED DID AND IF WE CATCH. ONE OR TWO CORPORATIONS THAT ARE GREENWASHING THEIR THEIR NUMBERS AND WE ACTUALLY CORRECT AT HI BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT CARP IS GONNA COMMEND THAT'S PROBABLY A GOOD- A GOOD- MEASURES SO. I'LL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR ON THIS- SO THAT IT'S ROBUST AND IT'S MEANINGFUL FOR THE TIDE DAY INTERNATIONAL DIALOG THEY THINK IT'S KEYED UP FOR. THANK YOU SO I. CAL SKI OTHER QUESTIONS SAYING NONE. OF WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE SENATE LEADERS ARE MOTION. SO HERTZBERG MOVES THE BILL. SIR WIENER DE CARA CLOSE THANK YOU- YEAH AND I REALLY APPRECIATE- CENTER LOCALES KEYS- COMMENTS I THINK THIS BILL IS THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF GIMMICKY IT OR GIMMICKY WE WOULDN'T HAVE HAD ALL THE EIGHT HUNDRED POUND GORILLAS FROM THE CORPORATE- FROM THE COMPANY COMPANIES REPRESENTING THE BIGGEST CORPORATE ACTORS IN THE WORLD- OPPOSING THE BILL- BECAUSE IT DOES ACTUALLY WILL. DO SOMETHING SIGNIFICANT- RIGHT NOW AND FOR ANYONE WHO FOLLOWS MY WORK RIGHT IN TERMS OF- CLIMATE CHANGE- I'D BE COVERED VARIOUS ASPECTS OF IT I DO WORK AROUND LAND USE AND WE'VE HAD BIG FIGHTS IN THIS CHAMBER. ABOUT FOCUSING MORE HOUSING NEAR JOBS AND TRANSIT. FOR DRIVING LESS WORK AROUND SOLAR AND THANK YOU COLLEAGUES FOR SUPPORTING A NUMBER OF MIND OF OUR SOLAR BILLS. SO I WORK IN A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT AREAS AROUND CLIMATE AND BIG CORPORATIONS ARE CERTAINLY NOT THE ONLY- CORPORATE WE'RE ALL OF US ARE OUR CARBON EMITTERS- IN VARIOUS WAYS. BUT- ARE ARE BIG CORPORATIONS ARE SIGNIFICANT EMITTERS OF CARBON TO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT ROLE TO PLAY AND THAT'S WHY IT'S STILL A SMALL PERCENTAGE BUT MORE MORE LARGE COMPANIES LIKE THE MICROSOFT TO MCDONALD'S AND WALMARTS OF THE WORLD. ARE RECOGNIZING THAT THIS DISCLOSURE IS IMPORTANT THAT THEY WANT TO BE GREEN AND THEY WANT TO BE VERIFIABLY GREEN BECAUSE RIGHT NOW A LOT OF COMPANIES CLAIM TO BE GREEN BUT IT'S NOT VERIFIED AT ALL. AND YOU KNOW WHEN THE AMAZONS AND UBERS OF THE WORLD AT CENTER AT CENTER ETCETERA START HAVING DISCUSSES DISCLOSE THEIR ENTIRE CARBON FOOTPRINT. THAT'S GOING TO PUSH JYJ PRESSURE. ON THESE COMPANIES TO REDUCE THAT FOOTPRINT BECAUSE THEY'RE GONNA LOOK BAD IF THEY DON'T AND WE'RE ALSO GOING TO SEE SOME INDUSTRIES WHERE WE KNOW THAT THERE. ARE CLIMATE PROBLEMS AND WE'RE NOW GOING TO KNOW FOR SURE AND THE PUBLIC WILL KNOW FOR SURE THIS IS AN IMPACTFUL BILL- WE'RE GOING TO KEEP WORKING ON IT. AND COLLEAGUES I APPRECIATE YOUR FEEDBACK AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SIR WIENER THAT AND SHE COUNCIL STRATEGY CALL THE ROLL. A. MOTION BY SIR HERTZBERG.

WE HAVE NO ONE IN OPPOSITION ABOUT THE SEVEN SEVEN SIX ALL RIGHT- THE BILL'S ON CALL BUT I THINK WE NEED TO GO AHEAD AND REVOKE THIS SO- WE DON'T. ALL RIGHT WE'RE NOT GOING TO VOTE AGAIN WE ARE GONNA LOOK CALLS LATER ON IN THE BILL ALL RIGHT. SO NEXT. WE WILL GO. TO SIR WHAT CAL SKI. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- FIRST I'D LIKE TO START OFF BY ACCEPTING TO PROPOSE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS- IN THE BILL ANALYSIS UP TO THIS BILL SB THREE OR FIVE THREE ONE AT ITS CORE IS ABOUT- BASIC RECORD KEEPING TRANSPARENCY AND PROTECTIONS FOR CONSUMERS THAT HAVE DEBT SO BACK IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN WE PASSED THE FAIR DEBT BUYING PRACTICES ACT WHICH BROUGHT NEEDED REFORM TO THE LARGELY UNREGULATED AND BROKEN SYSTEM OF DEBT BUYING IN CALIFORNIA. AT THE TIME THERE WERE WIDESPREAD CASES OF COLLECTING THE DEBT AGAINST THE WRONG PERSON WIDESPREAD CASES ABOUT TARGETING THE THAT THAT ALREADY BEEN PAID OFF AND EFFORTS TO COLLECT THE INCOME INCORRECT AMOUNT OF DEBT. PROBLEM THE PASS ALONG WE SOLVED IT RIGHT. WELL THE HELP TO DRESS THESE ISSUES BY REQUIRING DEBT BUYERS WHO HAD DEBTS SOLD OPERATIVE WORD BEING SOLD TO THEM AND THEY HAVE TO HAVE PROOF THAT THEY HAD OWNERSHIP THAT THEY HAVE BOUGHT IT TO ALLOW CONSUMERS TO REQUESTS AND TO REQUEST THAT PROOF IN LAW ALSO REQUIRED THE DISCLOSURE OF THE BASIC INFORMATION SUCH AS HOW. MUCH THE DEBT WAS OWED IF THERE WERE ANY FEES OR INTEREST. AND THE DATE OF THE LAST PAYMENT. NOW WE COME OVER. TODAY AND WE GET REPORTS FROM LEGAL SERVICES ON DEBT COLLECTORS ARE GOING OUT OF THEIR WAY. TWO RESEARCH- WE DIDN'T FIGHT THAT DEBT THIS THERE WERE ONLY COLLECTING ON A SIDE DEBT SO WHICH IS A SIGN BECAUSE WE DIDN'T BY SO HERE WE GO AGAIN WE GOT. BECAUSE THE DEAL BECAUSE THE ASSIGNED IT IS NOT BEING SOLD CONSUMERS RIGHTS AND ALL THE PROTECTIONS THAT WE THOUGHT WE PUT IN PLACE BY THE- FAIR DEBT BUYING PRACTICES ACT. WHICH CIRCUMVENTED ANY DON'T REPLY SO WHAT WE SEE ON THE STREET DEBT COLLECTORS ARE TARGETING WRONG DEBTORS THEY'RE COLLECTING THE INCORRECT AMOUNT THE TO THE CONSUMER HAS NO WAY TO DETERMINE THE TRUTH OF WHO IT IS SO. YOU KNOW THE HIGHLIGHT THIS THAN THE NEED FOR THE- THIS BILL IN FRONT OF YOU THE BUREAU OF CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION FOUND THAT FROM 200-016-2000 SEVENTEEN THAT'S THE LESSON WE HAVE- INFORMATION COLLECTING A DEBT NOT VOTE WAS THE NUMBER ONE CONSUMER PER. COMPLAINT IN IN CALIFORNIA TWO OR THREE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AND ELEVEN COMPLAINTS THAT AND THAT ONLY INCLUDES REPORTED. SO THIS BILL. ASIAN WHEN YOU REVISED MACHIN WOULD REQUIRE DECAL. WHO HAVE LIQUID DEBTS ASSIGNED TO THEM TO HAVE PROOF THAT THEY HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO COLLECT ON THE DEBT. THE BILL ALSO GIVE CONSUMERS THE RIGHT TO REQUEST STEP PROOF ALONG WITH SOME BASIC INFORMATION WITH REGARD TO THE- THE DEBT- ALL THESE RIGHTS THAT APPLY TO THE FEAR. DEBT BUYING PRACTICES AND SOLD THAT APPLIES TO SIGNED. IN OF SB FIVE THREE ONE WILL ALSO REQUIRE A SIMPLE WE CALL IT A GOOD BYE LETTER. IN OTHER WORDS HAVING THE ORIGINAL CREDITOR WHOEVER YOU. HAD THE DATE WITH BEFORE- SEND NOTIFICATION TO CONSUMERS ON WHO THEY'RE SELLING TO THAT TO OR WHO THEY'RE ASSIGNING DID IT TOO ALONG WITH THE REMAINING BALANCE THIS WILL ENSURE THAT CALIFORNIA. DEBTORS AND CONSUMERS ARE MORE LIKELY TO OPEN. UP THE MESSAGE IF IT'S AN EMAIL OR A LETTER IN BELIEVE IT RATHER THAN BEING TOLD BY SOME THIRD PERSON THAT THE THIRD PARTY DAY THEY NEVER HEARD OF THAT THE- THEM- MONEY AND THERE'S ENOUGH SCAMS GOING OUT THERE SO. LET'S HELP CONSUMERS AVOID CONFUSION THE SUSPICIONS OF FRAUD AND- THIS CONTINUITY IS VERY IMPORTANT IN IN TODAY'S AGE AND I HAVE LEE FERRAN WITH THE PUBLIC LAWCENTER. TO IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU SO AYE CASKEY ALL RIGHT NOW WILL GO TO ORANGE COUNTY'S OWN LEAF AARON'S. WE ARE YOU ONLINE THIS VERY ONLINE. HE'S HERE. I AM GOOD EVENING WONDERFUL CARING MEMBERS THANK YOU AYE I AM IN ORANGE COUNTY TO NATO AND MY NAME IS LISA AND I'M THE DIRECTOR OF LITIGATION AND POBLANO WITH THE PUBLIC LAWCENTER WHICH IS A NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION PROVIDING FREE LEGAL SERVICES TO LOW INCOME INDIVIDUALS. IN ORANGE COUNTY. AT THE BANK TODAY IN SUPPORT OF SB FIVE THIRTY ONE WHICH WILL PROVIDE ADDITIONAL PROTECTION FOR CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS DEALING WITH THAT COLLECTION ACTIVITY. AND I CAN THINK LOCKED. HE'LL BE WORKING WITH LOW INCOME CONSUMERS OVERSEE COLLECTION LETTERS FROM OR HAVE BEEN FUELED BY DEBT COLLECTOR. ONE OF THE FIRST QUESTION WE ASKED IS WHETHER OR NOT THE LIENT IS THE MIGLIOR WITH THE DEBT COLLECTOR. MOST OF THE TIME OUR CLIENT THEY KNOW THEY'VE NEVER HEARD OF THEM. DEPENDING ON THE INFORMATION PROVIDED IN THE COLLECTION LETTER OR IN THE LAWSUIT AFTER SOME INVESTIGATION WE CAN USUALLY FIGURE OUT WHO THE ORIGINAL CREDITOR IS- AND SOMETIMES IDENTIFY THE ACCOUNT THE DEBT COLLECTOR. COLLECTING I BECAUSE SOME THAT IT BETTER UNREST. IN BUT MANY CALIFORNIANS EXPECT NAVIGATING THE COMPLEX NETWORK AND THAT COLLECTORS AND I THINK NEEDS ON THEIR OWN. AND THEY MAY NEVER BE CONFIDENT BUT AT THAT COLLECTOR IS TRULY COLLECTING AND THAT THE SALE. WHAT WE DO NOW IS OUR CLIENTS KNOW THEIR ORIGINAL CREDITORS. BUT MUCH MORE LIKELY TO REVIEW MAIL SENT BY THEIR ORIGINAL CREDITOR. THE REQUIREMENT IN SB FIVE THIRTY WIND THAT THE ORIGINAL CREDITOR CREDITOR PROVIDE INFORMATION OF THE ENTITY THAT WILL BE COLLECTING THAT THAT. WOULD ALLOW DEBTORS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE PROCESS OF THAT COLLECTION AND WILL ALLOW THEM THE OPPORTUNITY TO RESOLVE THEIR DEBT MUCH EARLIER IN THE PROCESS THE FACT THAT THE FEES AND COSTS HAVE BEEN ADDED ON. IN ADDITION WHEN OUR CLIENTS ARE FACING COLLECTION IN SOME INSTANCES A DEBT COLLECTOR ATTEMPTING TO FIND AT THAT. I'M IN THE HOSPITAL HOSPITAL AND MEDICAL THAT WAY TO PROVIDE IT WILL NOT SELL THE DEBT BUT INSTEAD OF FINDING THE RIGHT TO COLLECT TO A THIRD PARTY DEBT COLLECTOR. SENATE OVER CATHY EXPLAINED THAT MEANS THAT THE FACT THAT BUYING PRACTICES ACT DOES NOT APPLY. AND THEY DON'T HAVE AND THE DEBT COLLECTOR DOES NOT HAVE TO PROVIDE THE SAME INFORMATION WHICH IS BASIC INFORMATION BY THE WAY. THAT THAT THAT BUYER DOES. SB FIVE THIRTY ONE WOULD REQUIRE THE DEBT COLLECTORS BETTER AND FIND THAT WOULD HAVE PROVIDED INFORMATION TO THE BETTER SUCH IS THE NATURE OF THE UNDERLYING THAT THE DATA DEFAULT OR THE DATE OF LAST PAYMENT. IN THE NAME AND ADDRESS OF THE ORIGINAL CREDITOR. IN ADDITION THE BILL WILL PREVENT A DEFAULT JUDGMENT FROM BEING ENTERED OF THIS INFORMATION IS NOT INCLUDED IN A LOT. CALIFORNIA BETTER SHOULD NOT END UP WITH A DEFAULT JUDGMENT FROM A DEBT COLLECTOR THAT CANNOT EVEN TELL THEM TO THE ORIGINAL CREDITOR AND- ADVOCATE AT THE FIVE THIRTY ONE IN THE URGENT I THOUGHT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU WAS FOR AN ART. OTHERS IN SUPPORT I SEE NO ONE IN THE GALLERY I SEE NO ONE IN ROOM ONE TWELVE. DO WE HAVE.

WIENER HI YOU HAVE STEPHANIE YOU HAVE NINETY ONE SO FAR WITH ONE MEMBER MISSING ALL RIGHTS WILL PUT THE BILL ON CALL- MEMBERS OF THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE AS MUCH FUN AS WE'VE HAD HANGING OUT HERE TODAY- THIS IS GOING TO COME TO AN END SOON. WE HAVE ONE I KNOW SAID EARLIER IS DISAPPOINTED- WE HAVE ONE MORE BILL CENTER COVER HEROES SB SIX SEVENTY AFTER THAT WILL BE LIFTING CALLS. FOR THE COMING YEAR- YOU CAN PRESENT YOUR BILL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS- FIRST I'D LIKE TO BEGIN BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS AND I WANT TO THANK. YOU AND YOUR STAFF FOR WORKING. SO DILIGENTLY WITH MY OFFICE- SB SIX SEVENTY ATTEMPTS TO ACCOMPLISH TWO GOALS. ONE IS TO STOP IMMIGRATION CONTROL CONSULTANTS FROM PRACTICING LAW WITHOUT A LICENSE. AND THEREBY- ARGUING OR INJURING THE IMMIGRATION CASE AB OF THEIR CLIENTS- RESULTING IN DEPORTATION OR EXCLUSION FOR AN FROM ADMISSION TO THE UNITED STATES NUMBER TWO TO PROTECT IMMIGRANT CONSUMERS FROM BEING PREYED UPON WHERE THEY GET CHARGED EXORBITANT FEES AND THEY'RE GIVEN FALSE HOPE AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO THE THOUGHT THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO EMIGRATE WHEN THERE REALLY IS NO CHANCE FOR YEARS AGO I DID A BILL TO ELIMINATE THE PRACTICE OF THE IMMIGRATION CONSULTANTS AND THAT WAS NOT SUCCESSFUL LAST SESSION ANOTHER ATTEMPT WAS MADE AND THAT. ALSO WAS UNSUCCESSFUL SO FOR FOUR YEARS NOW WE TRY TO GET THIS DONE AND IT HAS NOT BEEN SUCCESSFUL TO ELIMINATE THE PRACTICE SO WHY DO IT NOW I BELIEVE I BELIEVE THAT IMMIGRAION REFORM IS IMMINENT AND THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS FINALLY GOING TO TAKE ACTION TO RESOLVE- HOW IMMIGRANTS CAN- BECOME LEGALIZED CITIZENS IN THAT THAT'S MY HOPE AND MY PRAYER. MORE IMPORTANTLY WE NEED TO PROTECT IMMIGRANT CONSUMERS AND STOP THE ILLEGAL PRACTICE OF LAW AND WE NEED TO ALLOW THE THOUSANDS OF SMALL BUSINESS. ENTERPRISES TO CONTINUE. THE PRACTICE AS LONG AS THEY ARE FOLLOWING THE LAW THAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE IN THE DATA SHOWS VERY CLEARLY THAT. THAT A MAJORITY OF THE OF THE IMMIGRATION CONSULTANTS CURRENTLY ARE ARE WOMEN BECAUSE WOMEN OWNED BUSINESSES. SO SIX. SB SIX FIFTY FIFTY WOULD DO THE FOLLOWING IT WOULD CHANGE THE NAME OF THEIR IMMIGRATION CONSULTANTS TO ONE THAT IS MORE APPROPRIATE TO THE SERVICES THEY ARE AUTHORIZED TO PROVIDE. A PROVIDE WOULD LIMIT THE FORMS THEY CAN FILL OUT AND I'VE BY A- I'VE BEEN ASKED TO TAKE. TO LIMIT MORE FORMS AND WE'RE LOOKING AT THAT BECAUSE I THINK THAT MAKES MORE SENSE- THEY SHOULD NOT BE PRACTICING LAW SHOULD THEY SHOULD NOT BE GIVING LEGAL ADVICE OR IF THERE'S OTHER FORMS THAT THEY NEED TO BE RESTRICTED FROM USING THAT'S FINE. AND RESTRICT THE LANGUAGE CONSULTANTS USED TO DESCRIBE THEMSELVES. SO THAT THERE'S NO CONFUSION THEY ARE NOT ATTORNEYS NOR DO THEY HAVE THE EXPERTISE IN IMMIGRATION MATTERS. AND FINALLY THE TO REQUIRE AN EDUCATIONAL OBLIGATION THAT THEY- THAT THEY THEY PERFORM. A SUMMARY OF THE AMENDMENTS IS FOUND IN IN THE ANALYSIS AND SO I'M I'M NOT GOING TO REVIEW ALL OF THAT- IN. AND I'VE BEEN WORKING DILIGENTLY OVER THE PAST YEAR TO ENSURE THAT SMALL BUSINESSES IN OUR STATE RECEIVED THE FINANCIAL RESOURCES THEY NEED TO STAY AFLOAT DURING THE PANDEMIC. THESE FORM PREPARES ARE ALSO SMALL BUSINESSES AND AS I SAID. OVER 60% ARE. MINORITY OWNED WITH- BUSINESSES MINORITY WOMEN OWNED BUSINESSES AND I'VE BEEN PRACTICING FOR DECADES. AT A TIME WHEN SMALL BUSINESSES AND WOMEN OWNED BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN HIT. THE HARDEST. BY THIS PANDEMIC TO PUT THEM OUT OF BUSINESS BECAUSE THERE'S SOME BAD ACTORS DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE TO ME IT'S NOT LOGICAL AND IT'S NOT FAIR AND THIS IS AN EQUITY ISSUE I'M TRYING TO CARVE A MORE BALANCED APPROACH TO THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE BECAUSE NOT EVERYONE CAN AFFORD AN ATTORNEY. OR AS ACCESS TO A COMMUNITY ORGANIZATION THAT PROVIDES THE SERVICES AT A LOW COST THE NUMBER OF THE ORGANIZATIONS INCLUDING SOME OF THOSE WHO MAY TESTIFIED TODAY IN OPPOSITION. HAVE INDICATED THEY CURRENTLY SERVE 10215% OF THE IMMIGRANTS THAT WALK THROUGH THEIR DOOR LOOKING FOR SERVICES AND THAT'S DUE TO THE LACK OF CAPACITY IN THE ORGANIZATION. AFTER RECOGNIZE A COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS CANNOT MEET THE DEMAND ALONE AND THAT FORM PREPARES CAN WORK COLLABORATIVELY TO PROVIDE THEIR AUTHORIZED SERVICES THIS IS PARTICULARLY TRUE IN MY REGION AND- SENATE DISTRICT TWELVE. WHERE THE IMMIGRATION- THE OFFICIAL IMMIGRATION SERVICES ARE NOT LOCATED AND WHERE IMMIGRANTS HAVE TO TRAVEL. MANY HOURS IN ORDER TO GO SEE A- A- PROPERLY LICENSED INDIVIDUAL. IN ORDER TO GET IMMIGRATION SERVICES SO I'M GONNA AND THERE AND IT'S BEEN A LONG DAY AND WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT ASSUMING THEY'RE STILL ON THE PHONE. IT'S ONE WHO DID IT ONE WITH THE ADDRESS AND MIKE BELOW. THANK YOU SENATE CAREER AS- IT'S A GOOD TEARS IF YOU'RE AVAILABLE. I AM RIGHT THE FLOOR IS YOURS. OKAY THE GERMAN TOM- BURKE AND HONORABLE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- AS PREVIOUSLY STATED MY NAME IS ONE POSSIBLE PETER I AM THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF ONE STOP IMMIGRATION CENTER. FIVE ONE THREE THREE NOT FOR PROFIT CORPORATION. I DO NOT HAVE A HORSE IN THIS FIGHT. EXCEPT THAT I'M NOT A VITAL ROLE BIG BOOTY MIGRATION CONSULTANT. ARE THEY IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN ALONE IMMIGRATION CONSULTANT HELP. UP TO TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND IMMIGRANTS. WOULD BE ELECTION OF PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN THE NEED FOR IMMIGRATION SERVICES CONTINUES TO GROW. REALLY THE ISSUE IS ALL ABOUT THE ACTION. UNDER CURRENT LAW I HAVE THREE WAYS TO GET HELP TO FILL OUT AND SUBMIT IMMIGRATION DOCUMENTS. GRATION APPEALS ACREDITA PROVIDERS ATTORNEYS AND IMMIGRATION CONSULTANTS. GRATION ISSUES REQUIRE THE SERVICES OF AN ATTORNEY BUT MANY DO NOT THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH PREMIUM IMMIGRATION ATTORNEYS TO MATCH BUT THE MAN MOREOVER NOT ONLY IS THE COST OF AN ATTORNEY OUT OF REACH FOR MANY BUT NOT OFTEN BEEN NOT ATTORNEYS WILL NOT EVEN ACCEPT A CLIENT ONLY REQUIRES THAT TRANSLATIONAL ALL FORMS. THE ONLY OTHER LEGAL OPTIONS FOR IMMIGRANT- FROM ACROSS THERE NOT. ALL THESE WORKERS DO YOU THINK TRAINING THEY ARE NOT REQUIRED WORK WITH AN ATTORNEY. BUT I THE OUTBURST. NOT ONLY ARE NONPROFIT. UPDATED IN URBAN AREA BUT ARE NOT NEARLY ENOUGH OF THEM- TO MEET DEMAND. OKAY HAVE MASSIVELY. AND FUNDING SHORTAGES- TO ISSUE GROWING WORSE WITH EACH PASSING YEAR. THE FACT IS NONPROFIT TOURNEY'S SIMPLY CANNOT FEEL ABOUT GAPS IN SERVICE. IMMIGRATION CONSULTANT OR FORCED TO CLOSE THEIR DOORS. SENATE BILL SIX.

EVEN THOUGH THE SUPPORT IN OPPOSITION REALLY TO SHARE A COMMON GOAL TO PROTECT AND CONSERVE THOSE SEEKING IMMIGRATION SERVICES. AS THE SENATE CALAR HEROES NOTED THERE HAVE BEEN ATTEMPTS TO ELIMINATE THE INDUSTRY WHICH HAS BEEN REJECTED AND THIS IS A MORE. BALANCED APPROACH THAT WOULD FURTHER REGULATE THESE CONSULTANTS AND ENHANCE CONSUMER PROTECTION- WE BELIEVE THAT THE REGISTERED AND BONDED IMMIGRATION CONSULTANTS DO EXCEPTIONAL WORK IN THE MAIN IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. IF YOU READ ABOUT UNLAWFUL IN THE CURRENT AND LAWFUL IMMIGRATION CONSULTANT IN THE NEWS. WE THINK MORE OFTEN THAN NOT IT'S A AND REGULATED KNOW TORIO. BUT NAY DIVISIONAL WHO'S NOT BACKGROUND CHECKED NOT REGISTERED NOT BONDED NOT TRACEABLE AND THERE IS REALLY IS A COTTAGE INDUSTRY THAT PREYS ON VULNERABLE. IMMIGRANTS SO WE THINK THAT THIS IS A BALANCED APPROACH THAT SHOULD BRING THE SUPPORT AND OPPOSITION TOGETHER TO STOP% FRAUDULENT ACTIVITY ILLEGAL MATERIALS ENHANCE CONSUMER PROTECTION ADD TO THE REGULATION. BUT CHANGE THE NAME TO FORM PREPARES AND WE THINK THIS IS A VEHICLE THAT COULD BRING THE PARTIES TOGETHER. ONCE AND FOR ALL AFTER MANY YEARS OF CONTENTIOUS DEBATE AND.

THIS SHOULD BE VERY EASY FOR THESE ORGANIZATIONS OR ENTITIES TO FIGURE OUT. THEY'RE EITHER A NONPROFIT AND THEY FOLLOW THE RULES. OR THEIR BUSINESS AND THEY FOLLOW THE RULES. BUT THEY CAN HAVE IT ALL WE AND NO- THERE IS THIS OVER AND THEY KNOW WHAT WHICH WHY THEY DO THEY DO. PLANER WITH- KNOWING THAT THEY ARE- GIVING INFORMATION THAT'S NOT CORRECT OR MAYBE THEY DON'T KNOW IT BUT THEY'RE ACTING AS IF THEY KNOW WHAT INFORMATION TO GET THEY HAVEN'T BEEN OUT OF PROPERLY TRAINED THEY HAVEN'T GOTTEN THE CREDENTIALS AND IT'S SHAMEFUL IT'S JUST SHAMEFUL TO DO IT IN THE COMMUNITY THAT NEEDS THE SERVICE SO BADLY- YOU KNOW OTHERS ARE. LEFT WITH THEIR RESPONSIBILITY YOU KNOW THE COUNTIES OR THE CITIES OF THE CITY ATTORNEY'S COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS THEY ARE LEFT HAVING TO FIX. OF PROBLEMS THAT ARE CREATED BY THESE ENTITIES I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THE COLUMN BECAUSE- THEY SHOULDN'T BE CALLED A NOTARY IN THE MORE THEIR CLINICAL CONSULTANTS THERE THEY MAKE UP ALL THESE TITLES AND THERE'S A HUGE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT'S BEING PAID TO THEM. SO I FEEL REALLY- I'M NOT ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE OF THE AUTHOR OF THE SENATOR- WE'RE BOTH WE'VE HAD SEVERAL CONVERSATIONS AND WE'RE BOTH. ON THE SAME SIDE AS FAR TRYING TO FIX THS BUT I DON'T THINK THAT MORE RULES ARE GOING TO FIX IT I DON'T THINK THAT MORE WORK I THINK THAT MORE RULES ARE GOING TO MAKE THEM LOOK LEGITIMATE. BOMB AND I DON'T MEAN TO PUT EVERY SINGLE ONE OF WHO DOES THIS IN THE SAME BRACKET IN THE SAME CATEGORY BUT THEY ARE MOSTLY. DOING AN INJUSTICE TO OUR COMMUNITY- OTHERWISE THEY WOULDN'T HAVE A PROBLEM MEETING THE ACCREDITATION REQUIREMENTS I MEAN JUST THE FACT THAT THEY'RE PUT ON THE SAME LEVEL OF YOU KNOW EITHER YOU GO TO A BOARD OF ACCREDITATION GET PROPERLY TRAINED AND ACCREDITED. OR YOU KNOW TURNING OR YOU GO TO THE IMMIGRATION CONSULTANTS THEY AREN'T AT THAT LEVEL THAT'S NOT WHERE THEY SHOULD BE PUT. SO I REALLY- I THINK THAT WE SHOULD. CONTINUE TO DO THE OTHER SIDE WHICH IS THE OTHER DIRECTION WHICH IS NOT LEGITIMIZE THEM. OF FIGURE OUT THE FOR THE ENFORCEMENT AND LAST I WANT TO SAY. IS THAT OUR STATE HAS INVESTED TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO PROVIDE THE KIND OF REAL QUALITY SERVICES THAT OUR COMMUNITY DESERVES. EVERY PART OF OUR STATE WHERE THEY'RE IMMIGRANTS WE SHOULD BE PROVIDING THIS EVERY PART OF OUR STATE WE NEED TO EXPAND THE CAPACITY. AND I AM FEARFUL- NOT THAT THERE WILL BE A DOOR WHERE SOMEBODY COULD WALK IN AND SAY I NEED YOUR IMMIGRATION SERVICES BUT THAT WHEN THEY WALK THROUGH THAT DOOR THE GETTING LEGAL ADVICE. AND THE PROPER ADVICE BY A PROPERLY TRAINED PERSON- THAT'S WHAT I'M WORRIED ABOUT AND ESPECIALLY WHEN WE WHEN COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM SO UNFORTUNATELY. I CANNOT- SUPPORT THIS BILL YOU VERY MUCH. THIRTY BORDERS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THERE IS A LAW CLINIC AT THE LAW SCHOOL AS A TEACHER IN COLOR A LITTLE BIT ABOUT. OTHER WORDS. FROM ONE LANGUAGE TO ANOTHER CAN MEAN TOTALLY DIFFERENT THINGS AND CAN HARKENS BACK TO THE HOLE ON THE TYDEUS RESISTIBLE GATHERS YOU KNOW A LAWYER VERSUS PREPARE AND HELP FOLKS WERE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF- THINKING THAT THEY WERE GETTING A SERVICE THAT THEY UNDERSTOOD IN THE HOME COUNTRY BUT IN THEIR NEW ADOPTED COUNTRY IT MEANT SOMETHING TOTALLY UNREGULATED AND- WITHOUT SUFFICIENT EXPERTISE. THAT THEY WERE EXPECTING I THINK THIS IS A VERY SMART WANT TO COMMEND THE CENTER FROM SALINAS THIS IS A VERY SMART WAY OF ALLOWING BUILDING BLOCKS- TO BE ESTABLISHED IN TERMS OF WHAT TERMINOLOGY IS APPROPRIATE- SO THERE'S SOME DEGREE OF CONSISTENCY. AND WHEN INDIVIDUALS DO NOT HAVE THE SUFFICIENT EXPERTISE BUT PRESENT THEMSELVES IN WAYS THAT ARE ANYTHING OTHER THAN DOCUMENT PREPARERS IT'S KINDA MINDS ME OF. THAT OLD LEGALZOOM- ENTERPRISE WERE THEY PRODUCE DOCUMENTS ARE NOT LAWYERS SIX MAKE AVAILABLE WHATEVER IT IS THAT YOU WERE- SEEKING TO ACQUIRE AND BY VIRTUE OF THEM GIVING THEM TO YOU. SOME FOLKS WERE THINKING THAT IT WAS VALIDATING WHAT. FORMS THEY WERE FILLING OUT. YOU CAN'T FIX ALL OF THE UNEXPECTED EXPECTATIONS OF A CONSUMER BUT YOU CAN CERTAINLY START WITH HAVING A CONSISTENT SET OF TERMINOLOGIES SO I'M PROUD TO SUPPORT THIS BILL. THANK YOU VERY AND SALAS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- I TOO WANT TO THANK SENATOR KABBADI AT ALL FOR- BRINGING THIS FORWARD I'VE ONLY BEEN IN THE SENATE NOW FOR ALMOST TWO YEARS AND I'VE SEEN JUST VARIOUS. ITERATIONS OF WHAT- THIS BILL COULD LOOK LIKE BUT I'M I'M- WHAT I'LL SAY IS- I'M I'M GLAD THAT THIS IS MOVING IN A DIRECTION THAT SEEMS MORE POSITIVE IN MY OPINION. HELLO I TO WILL NOT BE SUPPORTING THE BILL BUT- WHAT I AM HOPEFUL OF IT IN LOOKING AT THE L. A. COUNTY LETTER. THAT OUTLINED QUITE A FEW DIFFERENT OPTIONS THAT COULD BE AMENDED DOWN THE ROAD. LOOTING- OF COURSE PROHIBITING NEW IMMIGRATION CONSULTANT REGISTRATIONS WHICH WHICH HAS BEEN DONE IN OTHER STATES OF COURSE CLEAR DISCLOSURES BUT I WAS A KEEN ON OF COURSE EXPANDING THE LIST OF PROHIBITED IMMIGRATION FORMS WHICH I KNOW IS STILL VERY MURKY WE DON'T KNOW WHICH ONES YOU KNOW GET US IN TROUBLE ESPECIALLY ARE THE ONES THAT- FOR ASYLUM SEEKERS AS WE KNOW IT'S BEEN ONE THAT HAS BEEN RAISED IN THE PAST AND ISSUE THAT'S BEEN RECENT PAST AND SETTING FEE CAPS. IN MY DISTRICT TO HEAR SO MANY- OF ARE UNDOCUMENTED COMMUNITY MEMBERS THAT PAY EXORBITANT AMOUNTS OF MONEY TO PEOPLE THAT THEY JUST DO NOT TRUST AT THE END OF THE DAY AND WHO END UP PUTTING THEM IN A WORSE POSITION AS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT TALKED ABOUT BEFORE- LONG BEACH NOW AS- YOU KNOW. NOW I ALSO SEE ABOUT THE THOUSANDS CHILDREN THAT HAVE COME TO THE CONVENTION CENTER WHO WILL NEED SERVICES AND I'M WORRIED THAT WORKING GOING TO POTENTIALLY. CONTINUE TO EXACERBATE THE PROBLEM BY ALLOWING YOU KNOW MORE IMMIGRATION CONSULTANTS ARE FORM PREPARES TO CONTINUE ON AND BE GRANDFATHERED IN IN THE PLACE WHERE. YOU KNOW WE NEED WE NEED THEM THE MOST NOW BUT WE NEED THEM TO ENSURE THAT THEY'RE GETTING IN ORDER- AND THAT AGAIN THE DISCLOSURES ARE CLEAR. AND THAT WE KNOW EXACTLY- WE HAVE WE HAVE A BETTER WE HAVE THEM IN A BETTER PLACE SO. WITH THAT SAID- I KNOW YOU'LL CONTINUE TO WORK ON ON THIS- AS IT MOVES FORWARD I WON'T BE. VOTING ON THE BILL TODAY BUT I JUST WANNA THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS- TO THE ATTENTION OF ALL OF US IN CONTINUING THE CONVERSATION AND- I'VE- PEOPLE HAVE TO SAY APPRECIATED THANK YOU AND I. APPRECIATE THE STAKEHOLDERS FOR CALLING INTO. ALL RIGHT ANY OTHER COMMENTS NONE QUESTIONS DONE ALL RIGHT IS THERE MOTION. BOATSWAIN MISTER AND I'M SORRY. SERVICE STERN. I DON'T MEAN IF YOU LABOR DAY SAYS CENTRE GONZALEZ JUST- IT JUST TOUCHED MY SHOULD I WAS OPENING HER CLOTHES MAYBE CENTER COPYRIGHT COULD ADDRESS THE FOR OUTSTANDING- FOR OUTSTANDING AMENDMENT REQUESTS FROM L. A. COUNTY- THAT'S GOING TO BE TO. BE AN ABILITY TO REACH THOSE I THINK IS GOING TO BE THE REASON I CAN'T CAN'T BE THERE TODAY- CONSPICUOUS AND CLEAR DISCLOSURES. SPANOULIS V. CAPS- SO SINCERELY APPRECIATE THE WORK OF THE AUTHOR HERE AND I'VE BEEN BEEN THERE WITH HER IN YEARS PASSAGES. IN THOSE L. A. COUNTY POINTS ARE VALID SO IF YOU MISTER ADDRESSING YOUR CLOTHES FEEL FREE. ALL RIGHT. SINGLE OTHER MICROPHONES UP- IS THERE A MOTION. SIR HERTZBERG MOWS THE BILL SO CABALLERO BIGGER CLOTHES THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR- LET ME JUST ASSURE YOU THAT- I'VE LOOKED OVER THAT THE LETTER FROM L. A. COUNTY- AND I'M GOING TO BE WE'RE WORKING ON THE LANGUAGE AND WILL BE ACCEPTING ALL OF THE AMENDMENTS THAT THEY SUGGEST WE THINK THAT THEIR- THEY'RE REALLY VALID IT'S JUST A QUESTION OF WORKING OUT. WORKING OUT THE LANGUAGE- LET ME BE REALLY CLEAR ABOUT ABOUT WHERE WE'RE AT RIGHT NOW IMMIGRATION CONSULTANTS ARE A LEGITIMATE BUSINESS WE'VE NEVER SAID THEY CAN'T OPERATE THEY SHOULDN'T BE PRACTICING LAW BUT WE HAVEN'T ARTICULATED EXACTLY WHAT THAT MEANS- OTHER THAN TELLING THEM THEY SHOULDN'T BE. PRACTICING LAW AND QUITE FRANKLY THE BAR HASN'T DONE. ANYTHING ANYTHING ABOUT THE FACT THAT THEY'RE PRACTICING LAW THEIR LEGITIMATE WHAT WE'RE DOING. IN THIS BILL IS WERE ADDING SAFEGUARDS AND BOB I REALLY WANNA THANK LA COUNTY FOR THEIR LETTER BECAUSE THEY GAVE IT SOME SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS AND FRANKLY. IN THE LETTERS THAT I'VE REVIEWED THEY'RE THE ONLY ONES THAT THAT HAD. ON SOME SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS THIS REALLY IS AN EQUITY ISSUE AND IT'S A CONSUMER PROTECTION ISSUE WE'RE NOT DOING WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO PROTECTS ONSUMERS TODAY. AND AND YOU KNOW WE HAVE WE HAVE. A HISTORY. OF. SETTING UP BOARDS AND BUREAUS TO REGULATE THE BAD ACTORS. IN ORDER TO GET COMPLIANCE WITH CONSUMER PROTECTION. SO. SO WE DON'T WALK IN AND SAY OKAY YOU'VE GOTTEN BACK THAT BAD ACTORS AND LET ME JUST TELL YOU THAT WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET DATA FROM ALL THE DIFFERENT ORGANIZATION INCLUDING THE AG'S OFFICE THE AG'S OFFICE AND THE DIFFERENT COMPANIES- DEPARTMENTS THAT THAT DO IMMIGRATION- REVIEWS WITH WITH THE CONSULTANTS TO FIGURE OUT WHETHER THEY THEIR APPROPRIATELY BONDED AND THEYPAID THEIR FEES AND THEY'RE WORKING ACCORDING TO THE LAW THE LAWS AS THEY ARE IN PLACE RIGHT NOW AND QUITE FRANKLY WHAT THE DATA SEEMS TO SUGGEST AND NOBODY'S KIT KEEPING THIS DATA ON A STATEWIDE BASIS. BUT THE DATA SEEMS TO SUGGEST THAT IN REALITY IT'S NOT THE IMMIGRATION CONSULTANTS BETTER THE MAJORITY OF THE CASES IT'S A NOBODY ELSE IS THE NOBODY ELSE WHO HAVE SOLD THEMSELVES AS ATTORNEYS AND THEY'RE OUT THERE DID YOU KNOW ACTING ACTING AS IMMIGRATION CONSULTANTS CONSULTANTS AS WELL SO WHAT WHAT THIS BILL WILL START TO DO IS TO SET SOME PARAMETERS AROUND WHAT KIND OF FORMS YOU CAN USE WHAT KIND OF FEES YOU CAN CHARGE. HOW YOU CAN DESCRIBE YOURSELF AS AS MY GOOD A SENATOR FROM FRESNO SAID WORDS MATTER AND SO WHAT WE CALL THEM AND WHAT THEY'RE ABLE TO DO BECOMES VERY VERY IMPORTANT AND- IN REGARDS TO THE MONEY THAT WE SPEND THAT THIS THE STATE HAS INVESTED IN GOOD LEGAL SERVICES THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT THAT MONEY HAS BEEN WELL SPENT. AND AND I TOTALLY DISAGREE THAT IF WE PASS THIS BILL FIRST IT IN SOME WAY IT ABROGATE THE COMMITMENT FOR THE INVESTMENT. THAT WE'VE MADE WE COULD. WE COULD MAKE A TEN TIME INVESTMENT. TEN TIMES INVESTMENT AND WE SEE I THINK WE STILL WOULDN'T HAVE ENOUGH RESOURCES. FOR ALL THE QUESTIONS IN THE ISSUES THAT THAT IMAGE IMMIGRANTS HAVE IN NEED- WE DON'T HAVE THOSE RESOURCES SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO USE A VERY WISELY. AND FOR MY MONEY TO HAVE. THE FORMS FILLED OUT ONLY THE FORMS THAT WE INDICATING DICTATE WILL MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE BECAUSE THOSE FORMS ARE GOING TO TAKE SOME HELP AND HAVING SOMEONE WHO UNDERSTANDS HOW TO FILL OUT THOSE FORMS. CORRECTLY IS THAT AN APPROPRIATE TASK FOR WENDY'S PREPARES AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE BUT TODAY. THANK YOU. THE MOTION BY SENATOR HERTZBERG. MANAGE ACCOUNTS PLEASE CALL THE ROLL.
