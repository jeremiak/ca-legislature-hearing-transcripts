AND AND YOUR OTHER BILL AB EIGHT A ONE IS ON CONSENT SO WE HAVE A QUORUM WILL ADDRESS [inaudible] IS MY YOU READY TO GO THANK YOU SIR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'D LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR RECOMMENDING SEVERAL AMENDMENTS WHICH I'D LIKE TO ACCEPT WHIMS. BY CREATING THE SAFE EXCAVATION BOARD AN APPOINTED BOARD OF EXCAVATION STAKEHOLDERS FUNDED THROUGH FEES ON UTILITIES. WE DON'T NOTIFICATION CENTERS WHICH ARE NOT FOR PROFIT PUBLIC BENEFIT CORPORATIONS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR PROCESSING NOTIFICATIONS A PROPOSED X. EXCAVATION FROM EXCAVATORS. AND TRANSMITTING THOSE NOTIFICATIONS THE SUBSURFACE INSTALLATION OPERATORS WHO MAY HAVE SUB SERVICE INSTALLATIONS IN THE AREA. PIPELINES ARE SUPPOSED TO BE LOCATED BEFORE EXCAVATIONS BEGAN. HOWEVER A RECENT REPORT BY THE PC SENATE P. GENIES LOCATION OF PIPELINES WAS INADEQUATE. AND I CONSTRUCTION COULD BEGIN BEFORE CREW KNEW WHERE THE PIPES WERE LOCATED THE REPORT IDENTIFIED WIDESPREAD INSTANCES IN WHICH INFORMATION WAS FALSIFIED. THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE SUBSURFACE INSTALLATION OPERATORS SUCH AS P. JEANNIE TO SUBMIT AN ELECTRONIC POSITIVE RESPONSE THROUGH THE REGIONAL CENTER BEFORE EXCAVATION CAN BEGIN. POSITIVE RESPONSE REQUIRES THE PIPELINE OPERATORS TO NOTIFY A CENTER HOW THEY CHOSE TO RESPOND TO THE REQUEST. IN OF THE NOTIFICATION CENTER WILL THEN PUBLISH THESE RESPONSES ONLINE CURRENTLY ELECTRONIC POSITIVE RESPONSES VOLUNTARY IN CALIFORNIA AB ELEVEN SIXTY SIX WOULD REQUIRE THIS RESPONSE WHICH MANY OTHER STATES ALREADY DO.

THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU WRESTLING -- WILL -- TAKE THE MEASURE UP WITH THE MOTION ONCE WE HAVE A CORE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU. SO AS WE WAIT FOR A FOR MORE AUTHORS TO COME FORWARD -- STIR MAYES WOULD YOU LIKE. TO TAKE THE FLOOR AND PRESENT -- AB [inaudible] TWO THIRTY FIVE THE KOREA. THE FLOOR IS YOURS A GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS -- WASN'T EXPECTING TO COME UP SO SOON OF COURSE WORKING THINGS OUT BUT WORKS OUT I THINK FOR THIS THAT THIS COMMITTEE SO THANK YOU. TODAY I AM PROUD TO PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL TWO THREE FIVE WHICH SEEKS TO ESTABLISH THE CALIFORNIA WILDFIRE CATASTROPHE FUND. OVER THE PAST YEAR AND A HALF I'VE BEEN DEEPLY ENGAGED WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE COMMITTEE STAFF AND THE BROWN AND BEEN BOTH THE BROWN AND HOUSTON MINISTRATIONS ABOUT THE ISSUES. CALIFORNIANS FACING WITH CATASTROPHIC WHAT FIRE EVENTS. AS WE HAVE COME TO LEARN THIS IS AN AREA OF EXTREMELY COMPLEX PUBLIC POLICY THAT IS IN DIRE NEED. OF OUR DIRECTION OF LEGISLATIVE DIRECTION. SB NOT A ONE TOOK THE FIRST MAJOR STEP LAST YEAR IN SEEKING TO ADDRESS UNCERTAINTY IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS AS WELL AS DRAWING ATTENTION TO THE MASS OF VEGETATION MANAGEMENT ISSUE. WE FACE. IT'S A FACT CLIMATE CHANGE IS PRODUCING CONDITIONS THAT HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD AND SEVERITY OF WILDFIRES. ELEVEN OF THE TWENTY MOST DESTRUCTIVE FIRES IN OUR HISTORY OF OCCURRED JUST SINCE TWENTY FIFTEEN WITH FIVE OCCURRING IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND THE DEVASTATING CAMP IN WILL THE FIRES. OCCURRING THE FOLLOWING YEAR. AMONG THE ISSUES WE MUST ADDRESS THIS YEAR'S A SUBSTANTIAL LIABILITIES THAT ARISE FROM THESE FIRES. WE HAVE LEARNED THAT UTILITIES IN CALIFORNIA START ROUGHLY 10% OF THE FIRES WE SEE STATEWIDE EVERY YEAR. AND APPROXIMATELY 3240% OF THE CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES THAT'S WHY WE MUST ENCOURAGE THEM TO INCREASE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT PROCEDURES AND HARDEN THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE TO REDUCE. FIRE IGNITION. IMPLEMENTING SB NINE A ONE WILL LOWER VEGETATION ARE WILD LANDS REDUCE LIABILITIES ENCOURAGE INDIVIDUALS TO TAKE GREATER RESPONSIBILITIES FOR LIVING IN THE WILD AND URBAN INTERFACE. I'M MORE EVER I SUPPORTED THE GOVERNOR'S CALL FOR ADDITIONAL HUNDRED MILLION VEGETATION MANAGEMENT OVER WHAT WE CHIEF LAST YEAR AND A VAST FOR AN ADDITIONAL MUTUAL AID FUNDING FOR CAL FIRE. THE BATTLE FIRES WE COME UP SHORT. NONE THE LESS. IT IS BOB PROBLEMATIC A MINUTE IS PROBABLE THAT ONE OF THE THE THOUSANDS OF FIRES IGNITED EVERY YEAR. WILL SPIRAL INTO A CATASTROPHIC EVENT. WITH OR WITHOUT INVERSE CONDEMNATION ARE SIMPLE REALITY IS THAT THE PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF A POWER GREATER LESS THAN OPTIMAL. OUR UTILITIES ARE STILL SUBJECT TO MASSIVE LIABILITIES. FEDERAL FORCE MANAGEMENT POLICIES NEED TO BE UPDATED CLIMATE CHANGES MAKING MATTERS WORSE AND HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS CONTINUE TO SPRAWL. INTO AT RISK LOCATIONS. YOU KNOW I AM A CONSERVATIVE AND I DO BELIEVE IN MARKETS -- AND I BELIEVE THAT MARKETS WORK MOST OF THE TIME. BUT IN THIS SCENARIO -- THEY ARE INADEQUATE. IT IS FINANCIALLY IN FEASIBLE FOR OUR ENERGY PROVIDERS TO OBTAIN SUFFICIENT CASUALTY INSURANCE POLICIES TO GUARD THEM FROM THE LIABILITIES WE HAVE SEEN. IN RECENT YEARS FOR INSTANCE THE BASE INSURANCE TARGET FOR P. GENIE IS ROUGHLY ONE BILLION. CONTRAST TO THE POTENTIAL THIRTY BILLION IN LIABILITY THEY FACE FROM RECENT FIRE EVENTS. IN CONVERSATIONS WITH UTILITIES THEY CITED ADDITIONAL THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS THREE HUNDRED MILLION AN ANNUAL PREMIUMS TO OBTAIN AN ADDITIONAL BILLION DOLLARS AND COVERS THAT IS. THAT IS SELF INSURANCE. AND THESE LIABILITIES AREN'T JUST LIMITED TO P. JEANNIE THE MARKETS AND RATING AGENCIES HAVE DOWNGRADED OUR OTHER INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES AND ARE EXAMINING OUR PUBLICLY OWNED UTILITIES BECAUSE INVERSE CONDEMNATION APPLIES TO THEM AS WELL THIS IS JUST. THIS IS JUST DESPITE THE FACT THAT ESTEEM JEANNIE HAS NOT BEEN FINANCIALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR MAJOR DEVASTATING WILDFIRE OVER THE PAST DECADE -- BREAKING UP OUR UTILITY. THIS THING'S TOO LONG -- WE'VE BEEN DOING AN AWFUL LOT OF WORK ON THIS AS YOU KNOW -- I I'VE APPRECIATED YOUR YOUR HELP ON THIS -- CHAIR HOLDEN -- WE KNOW WHERE WE'RE AT WE UNDERSTAND THE GRAVITY OF THE SITUATION -- AND I WANT TO OFFER UP ON THAT AS A REPUBLICAN. THIS IS NOT A PARTISAN ISSUE. THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT THAT AFFECTS CALIFORNIA. AND OFTEN TIMES IN THE POLITICAL DISCOURSE WE WE USE AN OVER AN OVER USED TERM AN EXISTENTIAL THREAT. BUT QUITE FRANKLY BEFORE US WE DO HAVE AN EXISTENTIAL THREAT AND WE NEED TO BE COMMITTED TO IT IN A BIPARTISAN WAY TO BE ABLE TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM. I WAS THANKFUL OF FOR THE WORK THAT THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE DID WITH HIS STRIKE TEAM AND OF COURSE WE KNOW THIS REPORT CAME OUT A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO -- AND ONE OF THE THINGS IN THAT REPORT WAS THIS IDEA OF A LIQUIDITY FUNDED ALSO A CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRE FUND. WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS NOW FOR OVER A YEAR IT'S INCREDIBLY COMPLEX ABOUT WE MEET NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A VEHICLE TO MOVE FORWARD SO THAT FOLKS IN THIS HOUSE LEGISLATIVE% LEADERS. ON BOTH THE SPEAKER AND AND YOU CHAIR HOLDEN ALONG WITH THIS COMMITTEE AND WITH OUR SENATE I'M COLLEAGUES THAT WE CAN WORK ON A PRODUCT A TOGETHER. AND SO -- THIS -- I NOW UNDERSTAND THAT JUST SOME SOME COMMITTEE. AMENDMENTS -- AND I'M MORE THAN WILLING TO TAKE THOSE COMMITTEE MEHMET'S AS WE MOVE THIS PROCESS FORWARD AND ALSO WANTED JUST TO TELL YET -- A CHAIRMAN -- I I EXPECT THAT WE WILL HOLDING HANDS AT TOGETHER I'M ALL THE WAY THROUGH THIS PROCESS AND SO I WITH THAT I'VE. I'VE I GUESS I'VE GOT A COUPLE FOLKS THAT WANT TO TALK -- TO STUFF IF YOU WANT TO BE BRIEF MR CALLACE I'LL BE VERY BRIEF KEPT CALCIUM BEHALF OF SENATOR GAS ELECTRIC AS THE CHAIR KNOWS -- WE'VE DONE A LOT OF WORK IN THIS AREA WE NEED TO SEND POSITIVE SIGNALS TO THE CAPITAL MARKETS CAPITAL MARKETS AND ACCESS TO MONEY IS IMPORTANT TO DO THE OTHER WHILE FAR MITIGATION EFFORTS. WE'RE NOT TRYING TO AVOID RESPONSIBILITY OF GROSS NEGLIGENCE RECKLESS BEHAVIOR PATTERN OF BAD BEHAVIOR ALL THOSE KINDS OF THINGS ALL THOSE DETAILS NEED TO BE WORKED OUT WERE IN SUPPORT OF THE BROADER WILDFIRE MITIGATION FUND THAT THE AUTHOR NOTED WHAT'S INCLUDED. AND REFERENCED IN THE GOVERNOR'S REPORT. THANK YOU CHAIR AND MEMBERS RYAN PARINI ON BEHALF OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON BILL WE'RE NOT AN OFFICIAL POSITION ON THIS BILL WE DO SUPPORT. AS OUR SISTER UTILITY POINTED OUT OF ABROAD WHILE FAR FUN THAT -- HELP SOCIALIZE SOME OF THESE COSTS -- BORNE BY THE SIGNIFICANCE IN WILD FIRES YOU SEEN IN -- PAST YEARS I THINK -- WHEN I THINK YOU'RE -- LEADERSHIP ON THIS -- ISSUE AND WORK FOR LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU AS WELL AS THE AUTHOR AND OTHER AUTHORS WHO HAVE -- HAVE OTHER LEGISLATION ON A WORKING OUT THE DETAILS OF THE WILDFIRE OF FUN THANK YOU. THANK YOU -- BEFORE I CALL UP OTHERS WHO MIGHT WANT TO A TESTIFIED I DO WANT. TO THANK YOU -- THIS MAZE OF YOU HAVE -- BEEN VERY STUDIOUS AND VERY THOUGHTFUL ABOUT HOW TO MAKE YOUR WAY THROUGH THIS PROCESS -- YOU HAVE -- TURN YOURSELF INTO SOMEWHAT OF AN EXPERT I GUESS -- TO TAKING AND SO MANY DIFFERENT POINTS OF VIEWS ON IT -- AND I KNEW KNOW THAT THE COMMITTEE IN REVIEWING THE BILL -- RECOGNIZE THAT THERE WERE STILL A LOT OF UNANSWERED QUESTIONS AND I THINK WE ALL KNEW THAT GOING INTO THIS SO -- THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO KEEP THE CONVERSATION GOING I THINK THE STRIKE TEAM THE NINE A ONE COMMISSION IS GOING TO BE IN RECEIPT OF THE NINE A ONE OF THE GOVERNOR STRIKE TEAM -- SUGGESTIONS MAYBE THEY COME IN WITH SOMETHING DEEPER -- MAYBE NOT BUT THIS CONVERSATION WILL NOT END AND WE ARE. COGNIZANT OF THE FACT THAT -- THAT NOT ONLY OF THE MARKETS SORT OF IN TURMOIL AROUND THE UTILITY INDUSTRY -- BUT THEY'RE A LOT OF REPAIRS AND TAXPAYERS ARE A LITTLE NERVOUS AS WELL SO. MAKING SURE THAT WE DO SOMETHING THAT IS A SMART INAPPROPRIATE FOR ALL PARTIES I THINK IS ULTIMATELY WHAT WE WANT TO GET AND I BELIEVE WE CAN GET THERE. AND I APPRECIATE YOUR LEADERSHIP AND LEADING THE CONVERSATION THAT REGARD YEAH. HAVING SAID THAT I'LL TURN TO OTHERS WHO WERE WHO MAY BE HERE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN FAVOR. OF THE BILL THAT'S BEEN PRESENTED. SEEING NONE -- IS THERE ANYONE HERE TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE I WILL TURN BACK TO THE COMMITTEE AND DOCTOR QUIRK. UP FIRST OF ALL I'LL FOLLOW THE CHAIR -- YOU ARE A VERY GOOD LEGISLATOR I AM VERY GLAD YOU'VE TAKEN THIS ON I ADMIRE WHAT YOU DOING. THE MAIN COMMENT I HAVE HERE IS THAT WITH THE AMENDMENT IT SAYS. THE C. C. P.'S SHE C. P. USE A NAY ADDRESSED THE IOUS AUTHORIZED COST RECOVERY. MY PROBLEM WITH MAY IS THAT MAY WAS A NINE OH ONE AND AS A RESULT P. JEANNIE WENT BANKRUPT. ONE SURE BANKRUPT. YOUR COST OF BOUGHT WELL FIRST OF ALL IF YOU WANT. TO REALLY FIX THINGS UP YOU NEED A FEW BILLION DOLLARS WELL ONCE YOU'RE IN BANKRUPTCY YOUR COST OF CAPITAL GOES WAY OUT FURTHER. THE GOVERNOR WAS CRITICIZING THEM FOR SAYING WHAT WE WANT TO SELL EQUITY AT 16%. NOW I DON'T KNOW WHETHER IT SHOULD BE SIXTEEN OR TWELVE BUT I CAN TELL YOU IF YOU TRIED TO DO IT AT A NORMAL RATE. NOBODY WOULD BUY YEAH. UNTIL YOU HAVE A WAY OF KEEPING UTILITIES OUT OF BANKRUPTCY. THE RATE PAYERS ARE GONNA PAY THROUGH THE NOSE AND YOU KNOW THIS AND I KNOW THIS. I'M HOPING THERE ARE PEOPLE OUT HERE LISTENING TO ME THE STUPIDEST THING WE EVER DID. SELECT P. JEANNIE GO BANKRUPT. BECAUSE IT'S GONNA COST ALL OF US IN THE STATE WHO LIVE IN THAT TERRITORY A LOT OF MONEY. AND HAD THEY YOU KNOW I KNOW YOU THINK. AT SOME OF THE PEOPLE OUT THERE -- RATE PAYER SHOULDN'T HAVE TO PAY FOR THIS. THEY'RE PAYING THROUGH THE NOSE RIGHT NOW IN IN THE END. WHERE IS THE MONEY GOING TO COME FROM IT COMES FROM RATEPAYERS ONE WAY OR ANOTHER? AND LETTING IT INTO BANKRUPTCY JUST MEANS COSTS GO UP AND UP SO AGAIN. THIS IS. GOING THROUGH AND CAN CHANGE A LOT THAT I THINK THE MAY SHOULD BECOME A SHELL. AND WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT LATER THANK YOU THE DOCTOR QUIRK ISSA AS YOU KNOW LAST YEAR -- MY HEADS -- ARGUED VOCIFEROUSLY ABOUT THAT WORD. OUR FINAL A COMMITTEE HEARING WHETHER IT WAS -- MAY OR SHALL I BELIEVE THAT IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN HAVE BEEN SHALL THIS IS OUR FIRST HEARING ON ON THIS THE BILL -- THE LANGUAGE THAT WE HAVE TODAY I CAN PROMISE YOU THAT WILL BE AMENDED -- AS WE MOVE THROUGH THE PROCESS I THE ONE THING I I WANNA MAKE SURE BECAUSE THIS IS IF ANYTHING A WORK IN PROGRESS AS REMOVING FORD. I KNOW THAT I'VE SPOKEN WITH EACH OF YOU AND IN THE COMMITTEE WITH DOUG CHUCKLED AND I THINK WE SPENT TOO MUCH TIME TOGETHER AND I'VE. OF APOLOGIZE FOR TAKING UP SO MUCH TIME ON THIS IS THAT WE HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER ON THIS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PACKAGE BEFORE US -- IS THE RIGHT PACKAGE -- AND I'VE BEEN BEEN THANKFUL FOR THE DIALOGUE THAT WE'VE HAD SO FAR BUT THIS IS THE FIRST COMMITTEE AS WE WORK THROUGH THE PROCESS -- I I THINK IT'S GOING TO BECOME A PRODUCT THAT WE CAN ALL BE PROUD OF THANK -- YOU KNOW I I HAVE NOT TO BEEN. PART OF THE THE SELECT COMMITTEE OR ARE -- SOME THE DETAILED CONVERSATIONS THAT -- THAT YOU'VE BEEN. PART OF BUT DIDN'T CAN YOU -- EXPLAIN TO ME A YOU KNOW A THE THE GIVE ME THE SIMPLIFIED VERSION AS TO WHY. THE AVAILABLE PRIVATE INSURANCE INDUSTRY IS NOT ABLE. TO ADEQUATELY COVER SURE I WOULD -- THEN THAT'S ACTUALLY A GREAT QUESTION -- WHICH TOOK US A LONG TIME TO GET TO YOU ROM TO EVEN ASK THAT QUESTION. BECAUSE IN REALITY IF THERE IS GOING TO BE ANY SORT OF A FUND IT IT WOULD BE LIKE AN INSURANCE FUND IT'S AN INSURANCE PRODUCT THAT THE UTILITIES WOULD BUY INTO. SO THAT YOU KNOW WHY CREATING NEW AUTHORITY WHY HAVE A GOVERNING BOARD WHY. THE FIGURE OUT HOW TO CAPITALIZE IT WHY DON'T YOU GO OUT JUST BY AN INSURANCE PRODUCT. SO WE TALKED TO SOME EXPERTS -- AND WE FOUND OUT THAT YOU CAN'T BUY THERE ISN'T IN THE INTERNATIONAL MARKET YOU CAN'T GET FIFTEEN TWENTY THIRTY BILLION DOLLARS -- UNLESS YOU PAY FOR A FIFTEEN BILLION OUR POLICY TO PROBABLY COST YOU FOURTEEN BILLION -- WELL THAT THAT'S THE YOU KNOW THAT'S THAT'S NOT INSURANCE ITSELF INSURANCE THAT'S WHY THE FLORIDA HURRICANE FUND -- THAT WAS FOUNDED BECAUSE THEY FOUND IN FLORIDA THAT THEY COULDN'T GO OUT AND BUY INSURANCE UP EITHER AND THERE WAS THIS PROBLEM THAT THEY HAD. A TO FIX. THE PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE TO FIX HERE IS WE HAVE ELECTRIC UTILITIES -- THAT THE RATING AGENCIES BELIEVE OR NOT -- INVESTABLE OR ARE BEING DOWNGRADED BECAUSE THE LIABILITY FROM THESE WILDFIRES ARE TOO GREAT IN ESSENCE WHAT I'M SAYING THAT THERE ISN'T AN INSURANCE PRODUCT FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO TO BUY OR WE HAVEN'T HAD ANYBODY COME TO TALK TO US. THE TELL US THAT THERE IS AN INSURANCE PRODUCT -- THAT WOULD HAVE TO BUY WHICH IS WHY IN ESSENCE WE NEED TO SELF INSURE. WE THANK YOU. FOR THE PRESENTATION -- I I I MUST SAY THAT. I NEED. TO FROM MY PERSPECTIVE WE DID NOT LET. A P. JEANNIE GO BANKRUPT -- SO -- WHERE WE GO FROM HERE OR THE REALITIES OF TRYING TO ADDRESS? OF THE IMPACTS THAT OBVIOUSLY WHEN A UTILITY OF THAT SIZE DOES GO. INTO BANKRUPTCY THE RIPPLE EFFECT. TO THE REST OF THE MARKET IS VERY SIGNIFICANT AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO GET OUR ARMS AROUND -- NOW RATE PAYERS TO YOUR QUESTION -- MISS MURATSUCHI ARE ALSO PAYING THE PREMIUM SO THERE'S WE ALSO AND DISCUSSING THE CONCEPT AROUND. A FINE. RECOGNIZE THAT THERE'S GOT TO BE SKIN IN THE GAME FROM ALL. PARTIES OF WHAT THAT ULTIMATELY LOOKS LIKE. IS PART OF WHY THE COMMITTEE WAS NOT ABLE. TO COME UP WITH THE THE ANALYSIS AT THIS POINT AROUND THE OTHER AROUND THE CONCEPT BUT THE CONVERSATION CONTINUES YEAH AND SO -- WHEN WE HAVE A QUORUM -- WILL LOOK FOR A MOTION AND WILL. PROCEED FROM THERE THANK YOU MISTER PRITCHETT YOU GOT IT DR WOODS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF I'D LIKE TO FIRST OF ALL -- THIS IS A REALLY REGARD IT ASSEMBLY BILL.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR COLLEAGUES I WANT TO BEGIN BY ACCEPTING YOU COMMITTING THEM AND CENTER OUTLINED ON PAGE SIX OF THE ANALYSIS. EVERY MEMBER OF OUR LEGISLATURE KNOWS HOW UNACCEPTABLE IT IS SAID EVEN IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN WE STILL HAVE TOO MANY COMMUNITIES THAT LACK ACCESS TO CLEAN DRINKING WATER. IN MANY PARTS OF CALIFORNIA WE HAVE SMALL WATER SYSTEMS THAT HAVE SERIOUS DEFICIENCIES IN A VARIETY OF VARIOUS CAPACITIES MAINTENANCE OR CONTAMINATION ISSUES. THE SMALL WATER SYSTEMS CAN AFFORD TO MAKE THE IMPROVEMENTS THAT THEY NEED TO PROVIDE SAFE DRINKING WATER THEY'RE OFTEN NEAR LARGER WATER SYSTEMS. THAT CAN ACCOMMODATE A NEW WATER DISTRICT. WHILE CONSOLIDATION OF THE SYSTEMS CAN ENSURE CLEAN WATER FOR MANY WATER SYSTEMS ARE REGULATED BY THE CPC THE APPROVAL PROCESS IS ON DUTY TIME CONSUMING. IN SOME INSTANCES APPROVAL TAKES AS LONG AS SIXTEEN MONTHS AFTER MAJORITY RESIDENTS VOTE TO CONSOLIDATE. IT'S THE OBLIGATION TO SI PC TO REVIEW THESE CONSOLIDATIONS BUT THE LONGER THE REVIEW TAKES A LONGER CALIFORNIANS ARE LEFT WITHOUT DRINKABLE WATER. WE NEED TO BUILD PROTECT EXISTING REPAIRS AND DELIVER CLEAN WATER -- THIS BILL WOULD IMPOSE FLEXIBLE DEADLINES ON THE CPC FOR CONSOLIDATION APPROVAL TO ENSURE THAT THE AGENCY IS HELPING TO IMPLEMENT OUR GOAL OF PROVIDING CLEAN DRINKING WATER IT'S ALL CALIFORNIANS WITHOUT IT LIKE TO TURN IT OVER TO A WITNESS [inaudible] YEAH. ALL RIGHT I'LL GO IT JUST MEANS YOU CAN BE VERY VERY YES I WILL BE THANK YOU JACK HAWKS. EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA WATER ASSOCIATION. ABOUT TWENTY NINE HUNDRED COMMUNITY WATER SYSTEMS IN CALIFORNIA ABOUT NINE HUNDRED OF THOSE. ARE REGULATED UTILITIES ABOUT A HUNDRED AND ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED PUBLIC AGENCIES AND SPECIAL AND SPECIAL DISTRICTS THAT ARE A PUBLIC WATER AGENCIES. ABOUT HALF OF THOSE HAVE THE TECHNICAL MANAGERIAL AND FINANCIAL CAPE CAPACITY TO ACTUALLY HANDLE -- THESE ACQUISITIONS THAT LEAVES ABOUT TWO THOUSAND SMALL COMMUNITY WATER SYSTEMS MANY OF THOSE. HAVE -- SUSTAINABILITY PROBLEMS MANAGERIAL PROBLEMS WATER QUALITY PROBLEMS -- DESPITE -- SYSTEMS IN DISREPAIR. MANY OF THEM ARE IN X. -- ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES ARE SEVERELY DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. AND IT SO HAPPENS THAT THE THESE ACQUISITIONS UNDER THE P. UC'S PURVIEW JUST TAKE TOO LONG. AND OUR BILLS SIMPLY PROPOSING TO SHORTEN THE TIME FRAME AND GET US ALL IN THE PC COMMUNITY TO WORK TOGETHER TO EXPEDITE THESE -- CONSOLIDATION TO MAKE THEM HAPPEN FASTER THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MY NAME IS THAT WERE JACKSON AND I'M APPEARING TODAY ON BEHALF OF SPONSOR OF ASSEMBLY BILL. SEVENTEEN FIFTY ONE THE CALIFORNIA WATER SO SHE ASIAN. I'M ASSOCIATION SECOND VICE PRESIDENT 420-192-2020. I'M ALSO THE DIRECTOR OF RATES AND REGULATORY AFFAIRS FOR LIBERTY CHILES WEST REGION. IN THIS CAPACITY I'M RESPONSIBLE FOR THE REGULATORY APPROVALS ON ALL CONSOLIDATION APPLICATIONS. MADE BY MY COMPANY TO THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COULD COMMISSION. AB SEVENTEEN FIFTY ONE WILL ADDRESS -- THESE PROBLEMS WITH WITH THE TIMELY WITH THE UNTIMELY DELAYS BY CHANGING THE STARTING POINT FOR AN APPLICATION FROM EIGHTEEN MONTHS TO EIGHT MONTHS. IF YOU BEGIN WITH EIGHT MONTHS. ALL STAKEHOLDERS ALL STAKEHOLDERS WILL BE INCENTIVIZE TO BE MORE RESPONSIVE TO THE CUSTOMER'S NEEDS. WE STRONGLY URGE AND I VOTE ON AB SEVENTEEN FIFTY ONE THANK YOU THANK YOU. I'M HERE NOT IN OPPOSITION. SO OKAY -- TO SO. IS THERE ANYONE HERE TO SPEAK IN FAVOR OF THE BILL. CHAIRMAN. MY NAME IS JEFF TORTILLA PUBLIC ADVOCATE. AND BECAUSE I PARTICIPATED IN THE WASTE WATER WITH THE P. P. I SEE. I UNDERSTAND THAT WATER AND THIS IS JUST A FIRST STEP THAT NEEDS TO BE UNDERSTANDING OF THAT PRODUCT NEEDS TO BE BETTER CONSOLIDATES. BETTER PROTECTED AND BETTER UNDERSTOOD AND YOU NEED THE ONE THING I WOULD ASK CHU IS SUGGESTING REPORTING BACKS YOU SEE WHETHER YOU ARE SUCCEEDING. OF THE REPORTS THAT YOU HEAR ABOUT HOW LONG IT'S TAKING TO GET CLEAN WATER [inaudible] THANK YOU. EVAN JACOBS CALIFORNIA AMERICAN WATER IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL AND I WOULD JUST LET THE COMMITTEE NOW. TALK TO SOME MY PEERS AND OTHER STATES THE AMERICAN WATER SERVES IN MISSOURI FOR EXAMPLE WE'VE HAD EIGHT ACQUISITIONS RESULTING CONSOLIDATION LAST THREE YEARS AND THE AVERAGE TIME TO PROCESS THAT BY THEIR COMMISSION WAS FIVE MONTHS. ILLINOIS SIX CONSOLIDATIONS IN THE LAST THREE YEARS APPLICATIONS WERE PROCESSED AN AVERAGE OF FIVE MONTHS SO GIVES YOU SOME. REFERENCE POINT WHAT OTHER STATES ARE DOING TO HELP SOLVE THIS ISSUE WITH TOO MANY WATER SYSTEMS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR COMMENTS. OF NOBLE -- ENTERTAIN WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL MEMBERS. EXCUSE ME MATTHEW MARCUS WITH THE PUBLIC ADVOCATE'S OFFICE -- WE ARE THE ONLY PARTY TO EXAMINEES ACQUISITION PROCEEDINGS. ON AND WE SHOULD DO SO TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE ARE DONE WITH THE LOWEST POSSIBLE RATES CONSISTENT WITH SAFETY RELIABILITY BUT ABSENT OUR ANALYSIS IN FACT THESE RECOMMENDATIONS. THERE WOULD BE NO OTHER PARTY EXCEPT FOR THE UTILITY BUILDING THE RECORD AT THE PVC -- WE'RE HERE BECAUSE WE HAVE TWO CONCERNS WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THIS BILL WE DO RECOGNIZE THE AUTHORS LAUDABLE GOAL HERE. OUR CONCERN IS WITH THE SHORTENED TIME FRAME. ON WERE THE ONES THAT HAVE TO PERFORM THE SITE VISITS TO EXAMINE THE BOOKS AND RECORDS OF THE SAFETY PROGRAMS OF THESE UTILITIES. AND WE WANTED TO ALSO TRY TO COST EFFECTIVELY IN TIMELY SEVERAL THESE ISSUES WITH UTILITIES INVOLVED -- IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THESE ACQUISITIONS ORAL OFTEN CONTROVERSIAL. THEY RAISE MANY LEGAL POLICY ISSUES AND THEY CAN SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASE CUSTOMERS MONTHLY BILLS. SO OUR CONCERN IS WITH A SHORT TIME FRAME BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO RUSH INTO MAKING RASH DISHES DECISIONS HERE -- THERE'S ALSO AN EXPEDITED PROCESS AT THE P. YOU SEE WHERE THE STATE WATER CONTROL BOARD CAN GET INVOLVED. AND WORK WITH THE PC TO EXPEDITE THESE ACQUISITION PROCEEDINGS. AND SO TYPICALLY THESE HAVE BEEN DONE WITHIN A HUNDRED TWENTY DAYS. ON IT IS FOR THESE REASONS THAT WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THIS BILL. BUT WE DO RECOGNIZE THE AUTHORS OF ALTHOUGH IT LAUDABLE INTENT HERE. THANK YOU. OF ANYONE FROM THE PUBLIC HERE TO SPEAK AND OF OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. SAY NONE I WILL COME BACK TO THE COMMITTEE DOCTOR AND I THINK YOU. THANK YOU AND HAVE THANK YOU -- SO I WILL BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY BECAUSE AS MY MONEY TO SAY HASTE MAKES WASTE. AND I HAVE SAT IN THIS COMMITTEE LONG ENOUGH THAT WE CALLED THE C. P. YOU SEE UP HERE REGULARLY TO BEAT THEM UP ON NOT BEING ABLE TO FILL THEIR MISSION. AND THEN WE KEEP ADDING MORE AND MORE THINGS WITH TIGHTER AND TIGHTER TIME LINES THAT WE ADD UPON. WHAT THEY'RE ALREADY ASKED TO DO -- AND SO ANYTHING WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. DRINKING WATERING CONSOLIDATION OF BIG SYSTEMS IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE GET THOSE THINGS RIGHT AND SO WHILE I APPRECIATE THE GOAL OF THIS BILL I THINK WE STILL HAVE SOME DETAILS TO WORK OUT ON THE PROCESS TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE -- THAT EVERYONE IS CONSIDERED AN TREATED FAIRLY IN THIS AND THAT WE GET IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE GET IT RIGHT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. MURATSUCHI THANK YOU I WANTED TO ASK MR CHU I I KNOW THAT -- AS A A FORMER US ATTORNEY AND AND AND PROSECUTOR THAT. THAT -- YOU WOULD AGREE THAT. TO SOMETIMES DUE DILIGENCE TAKES A LOT OF TIME THE END THAT THERE MAY BE AN ADVOCACY OF RESOURCES. TO TO EXPEDITE -- THE DO ANALYSIS IN THE TO CONSIDERATIONS OF OF THESE CUTS WHAT I WOULD ASSUME TO BE COMPLICATED ISSUES WITH WHAT WHAT IS YOUR RESPONSE TO THE PUBLIC ADVOCATES SO I CAN'T AGREE WITH EVERYONE MORE. LISTEN WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS IS THE FACT THAT WE HAVE MANY COMMUNITIES THAT DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO DRINKING WATER WE HAVE TO SYSTEMS THAT HAVE AGREED TO COME TOGETHER WHERE YOU HAVE RESIDENTS OF THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE AGREED THAT THE SIR TO HAPPEN. AND THESE APPLICATIONS ARE TAKING THREE HUNDRED DAYS PORTER AND EIGHTY TWO DAYS IN SOME INSTANCES. OF FOLKS BEING DENIED WATER SO WE WANT TO PUSH EVERYONE TO DO THIS FASTER BUT AS I SAID IN MY OPENING. THIS BILL IS ABOUT FLEXIBLE DEADLINES AND LET ME EXPLAIN WHAT THAT IS. THE CHAIRMAN OF THIS COMMITTEE HAS ASKED US TO TAKE AMENDMENTS THAT ENSURE THAT IF IT TURNS OUT THAT SOMETHING'S GONNA TAKE A LITTLE TOO LONG AND I WILL QUOTE FROM THE AMENDMENTS. THE COMMISSION IS AUTHORIZED TO GRANT ADDITIONAL EXTENSIONS OF EIGHT MONTHS. WHEN IT COMES TO APPLICATIONS FOR CONSOLIDATION ADDITIONAL EXTENSIONS OF FOUR MONTHS WHEN IT COMES TO DEVICE LETTERS AND THEY CAN CONTINUE TO DO THIS OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN? SO ESSENTIALLY WERE SAYING AS WE WANT TO PUT SOME TIME FRAMES ON IT BUT IF YOU CAN'T MEET YOU CAN LET FOLKS KNOW AND YOU CAN GET EXTENSIONS -- A SIMILAR GARCIA. THANK YOU I I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD AS NOTED IN THE ANALYSIS BELLFLOWER IS ONE OF MY CITIES AND THE VOTERS WATER ON THIS TWO YEARS AGO. AND WE ARE THE CITY'S KILEY SUBSIDIZING WATER RATES AND IT'S A AND THEN CLICK THEIR ABILITY TO PAY FOR THE SERVICES -- AND THERE'S AN AGREEMENT ON ALL PARTIES IN THE COMMUNITY HAS SPOKEN BUT THE DELAYS AT THE PC I HAVE MADE IT REALLY DIFFICULT THERE TO MOVE FORWARD AND SO -- I APPRECIATE REMOVING THEIR PRE SHEET THAT THERE'S A FLEXIBILITY IN THIS AND THIS BILL AND WE DO HAVE AT ISSUES -- TIES AT THE PC ISSUES OF UNDER RESOURCES OR MAYBE ISSUES OTHER MISSION BEING A LITTLE TOO MUCH -- AND WE HAVE OTHER SOLUTIONS AND THAT WE MIGHT NEED TO BE CONSIDERING. LONG TERM BUT IN THE SHORT TERM STUFF LIKE THIS IS HELPFUL SO I WILL BE WAITING FOR A BILL TODAY THANK YOU. ANY OTHER A QUESTION OF SOMEONE EVEREST -- IT OKAY [inaudible] SEVEN ARRESTS. I WOULD LIKE TO ASK THE OPPOSITION. KNOWING THAT THE FLEXIBILITY WAS PUT INTO THE BILL AS AN AMENDMENT ALLOWING FOR EXTENSIONS. I I ONE OF THINGS I SEE THAT IS BENEFICIAL TO THAT IS THAT SOMEBODY HAS TO BE HANDS ON BEFORE THEY CAN ASK FOR AN EXTENSION. SO SOME ATTENTION WILL HAVE TO BE GIVEN. TO THIS APPLICATION THAT IS PENDING. BUT THE FLEXIBILITY IS THERE. TO ALLOW FOR EXTENSIONS. IN YOUR OPPOSITION CONSIDERING. CAN YOU ADDRESS THAT PART OF IT -- I KNOW WITH THE U. R. POST BUT TELL US ABOUT THIS FLEXIBILITY AND WHY THAT IS NOT WORKABLE. OKAY. SO FIRST I WANT TO DELINEATE MY OFFICE'S ROLE FROM THE CPU SEES. THE CPUC IS THE DECISION THAT THE DECISION MAKER THEY DECIDE WHEN TO ACT AND NOT TO ACT SO I DON'T WANT TO SPEAK ON THEIR BEHALF AND FOR ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS I THINK THEY'RE BETTER DRESSED TO THE PC. BUT FROM MY AUNT TO THE PUBLIC ADVOCATE'S OFFICE WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR BUILDING THAT RECORD FOR THE PC TO MAKE WELL INFORMED DECISIONS. IN CUSTOMERS BEST INTERESTS BECAUSE ON WE ALL HAVE YOU'LL HAVE CONSTITUENTS WHO GET DON'T HAVE THE TIME OR THE WHERE WITH ALL TO NAVIGATE. THE COMPLICATED STATE PROCESS SEES OKAY. ON THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT ARE BEYOND MY OFFICES CONTROL LIKE FOR EXAMPLE -- WE WE SUBMITTED REQUESTS MY OFFICE HAS ACCESS TO ALL THE SAME INFORMATION THAT THE PC DOES CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. THAT'S WHAT SETS US APART FROM OTHER ADVOCACY ORGANIZATIONS -- BUT WE SUBMITTED A REQUEST SOMETIMES IT TAKES WEEKS SOMETIMES IT TAKES A FEW MONTHS TO GET THE INFORMATION FROM THE UTILITY. OUR CONCERN IS WHEN THERE ARE DELAYS. ON THAT ARE TAKING PLACE THOSE ARE BEYOND OUR CONTROL AND WHEN YOU SAID A LINE IN THE SAND. ON HOW DO YOU CONTROL THOSE DELAYS US GETTING THAT INFORMATION TO BE ABLE TO BUILD THAT RECORD AT THE PC. ON FOR AND THIS IS NOT DIRECTED TO THE WATER UTILITIES OR ANYONE BUT FOR EXAMPLE THERE MOTIONS FILED BY THE UTILITIES LIKE. HE IT IN THE EVENT THEY WANT TO CHANGE THE NUMBER OF PAGES OF THE FILING FOR EXAMPLE. A JUDGE NEEDS TO WILL NOT IT AT THE PC SO THEN THERE'S A TIME THAT SPENT FINDING THE JUDGE AND AND HAVING THE JUDGE RULE ON THAT GREAT. TO HAVE TO HAVE ALL THESE ELEMENTS OF KERR AND THEN REALIZE WHERE YOU ARE TO WEAR TO WIN THE PEACE HE NEEDS TO ACT. AND SO. IF IF IF WE WANT TO GET THIS RIGHT WE NEED TO DO OUR DUE DILIGENCE AND SO AGAIN. I RECOGNIZE THE LAUDABLE GOALS THE AUTHOR IS LAUDABLE GOALS BUT THERE HAS TO BE A WORKABLE TIME FRAME HERE. IF I MAY MISTER CHAIRMAN. IF IF THE TIME FRAME AS I UNDERSTAND. AS I UNDERSTAND IS NOT SET IN STONE AND IT IS A LINE DRAWN IN THE SAND IT IS. WELL ACTUALLY IT IS DRAWN IN THE SAND AND YOU CAN ERASE IT AND YOU CAN EXTENDED AND DRAW THE NEW LINE ANY RACE THAT IF YOU HAVE -- TO SO. I APPRECIATE AND I WANT TO GO BACK TO YOUR WORDS IT'S A LAUDABLE GOAL AND I THINK THAT JUST AS MS GARCIA HAS AS INDICATED HER CITY. WOULD BENEFIT FROM HAVING SOMEBODY OVERLOOKED THIS TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE TIME LINES AND SOMEBODY HAS THIS URGENCY ABOUT GETTING IT TAKEN CARE OF IS THERE ANOTHER WAY TO TAKE CARE OF THIS LAUDABLE GOAL. THAT MISTER THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHIU HAS WE WOULD CERTAINLY BE MORE THAN WILLING TO WORK WITH THE AUTHORS OFFICE TO SEE IF THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE CAN CRAFT TOGETHER [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] DOCTOR QUIRK -- SO THIS BILL WENT THROUGH ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY AND TOXIC MATERIAL OF THE VOTING FOR HERE TODAY I WOULD JUST TELL OUR MEMBERS WHO RELUCTANT TO VOTE FOR THIS THAT THERE IS NO ENFORCEMENT. AND IN THE END WHAT WE'RE REALLY DOING IS EXPRESSING THE WILL OF THE LEGISLATURE THAT THESE GO MORE QUICKLY. BUT SINCE THERE'S NO ENFORCEMENT EVEN IF. THE COMMITTEE HAD NOT PUT THOSE AMENDMENTS IN. ALL I THINK THE MANAGER GOOD BECAUSE IT CONTINUES TO GIVEN THE TARGET. BUT I'M AS GUILTY AS ANYBODY AS TELLING DEPARTMENTS THAT THEY HAVE A DEADLINE AND THEN THE DEADLINE COMES AND GOES. AND YOU REALLY DON'T DO ANYTHING -- BECAUSE THERE IS NO ENFORCEMENT SO THAT PUBLIC ADVOCATE. CPUC DOESN'T HAVE TO FOLLOW THIS UNFORTUNATELY BECAUSE THERE IS NO PENALTY. IT'S SIMPLY WE'RE SAYING WE THINK IT OUGHT TO BE DONE MORE QUICKLY IN GIVEN HIGHER PRIORITY. BUT THE BIG PROBLEM IS THAT THERE IS TOO MUCH TO DO AND WE'VE HEARD THIS FROM HE DIRECTOR OF THE P. YOU SEE AS WELL. THERE'S TOO MUCH TO DO AND THEY HAVE HAND CUFFS ON SOME OF WHICH WE PUT ON WHILE I WAS HERE. AND IT MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO DO ANYTHING -- THEY CAN'T TALK TO PEOPLE OUTSIDE OF PUBLIC MEETINGS -- IT JUST GETS. VERY VERY DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO DO ANYTHING. AND I THINK WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO RE THINK THE P. YOU SEE. ARE PERHAPS MOVING PARTS OF IT AWAY -- PERHAPS MORE RESOURCES I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE ANSWER IS BUT I WOULDN'T WORRY ABOUT THIS BILL. AGAIN I THINK IT'S SIMPLY REFLECTING THAT THE LEGISLATURE THINKS THEY SHOULD BE DONE MORE QUICKLY BUT IN THE END THERE IS NO ENFORCEMENT -- IT WELL IT. EXPRESSES THE WILL OF THE LEGISLATURE TO GIVE THIS MORE PRIORITY THAT'S WHAT IT DOES. IF FOR NO OTHER ARE QUESTIONS -- WE WERE CHIU YOU'D LIKE TO CLOSE. APPRECIATE THE THE THE CONVERSATION OF COURSE OF MY STAFF HAS ALREADY BEEN ENGAGING WITH THE OFFICE OF PUBLIC ADVOCATE WE WE WOULD LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING WHAT YOU THINK WE OUGHT TO BE DOING IN THIS INSTANCE BECAUSE WE NEED TO MOVE THIS FORWARD AND I DO THANK. I DON'T THINK ANYONE WOULD DISAGREE THAT WE NEED TO MOVE THESE WATER CONSOLIDATIONS MORE QUICKLY -- RESPONDED TO TO MISTER PARKS POINT WHILE THERE IS NO ENFORCEMENT THE FACT THAT THERE ARE. TIME LINES IN THE FACT THAT WE NEED TO TRACK WHETHER PROJECTS ARE BEING MET GIVES US AN ABILITY TO HAVE SOME DATA. TO BE ABLE TO TO TO TO TELL ALL THE PARTIES -- IT'S LATE IT'S LATE AGAIN IT'S LATE AGAIN AND JUST KEEP PUTTING THAT PRESSURE I THINK THAT IS A BENEFIT IN AND OF ITSELF -- BUT BUT AGAIN WITHOUT I WANNA JUST MAKE IT VERY CLEAR THESE ARE FLEXIBLE DEADLINES I INITIALLY THOUGHT ABOUT INSTITUTING MANDATED DEADLINES AND REALIZE WE ARE LIKELY TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION SO I DECIDED TO CREATE FLEXIBLE DEADLINES. WITH THE IT WITH THAT THE CHAIRS AMENDMENTS THEY BECOME EVEN MORE FLEXIBLE. LINES IN EASILY MANIPULATED SAND BUT I A VERY MUCH THINK WE NEED TO DO THIS BECAUSE WHAT IS AT STAKE A MILLION PEOPLE STILL DON'T HAVE DRINKING WATER WITHOUT A RESPECTFULLY ASK. WE THANK YOU FOR THE BILL IT DOES THAT MAKE SENSE AND IT IS APPROPRIATE AND HAVING THE APPROPRIATE LANGUAGE THAT GIVES THE FLEXIBILITY WAS WHAT WAS IN MIND SO. WE WERE MINDFUL OF THE CONCERNS BUT WE DO APPRECIATE THOSE EVER BEEN PRESENTED -- THIS BILL -- ENJOYS A DO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS. CALL THE ROLL. AB SEVENTEEN FIFTY ONE THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS HOLDEN HI HOLDEN I PATTERSON. PATTERSON I BURKE [inaudible] DEAL. CARILLO I CHEN. CHEN I CUNNINGHAM. CUNNINGHAM. I EGGMAN. EGGMAN NOT VOTING [inaudible] CRISTINA GARCIA. CRISTINA GARCIA I RODRIGUEZ. RODRIGUEZ I MAYES. THERE IS THE G.. TWO G. I WORK AYE QUIRK AYE WE S.. YES I SANTIAGO [inaudible] TEEN [inaudible] THANK. THE BILL HAS TEN VOTES IT IS OUT WILL LEAVE THE ROLE OPEN MR STONE [inaudible] HELLO [inaudible] YEAH. STERN YOU'RE HERE PRESENT IN AB. THIRTEEN SIXTY THREE I AM MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS THAT I WANT TO THANK YOU AND YOUR STAFF FOR SPENDING SO MUCH TIME AND WORKING THROUGH. THIS ISSUE WITH US. AND WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE SOMETHING THAT'S WORKABLE. AFTER THE WILDFIRES THAT HAVE HAPPENED AND THE CULPABILITY OF THE SPECIALLY OUR LARGEST UTILITY IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. WE REMAIN VERY CONCERNED ABOUT BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE LEVELS OF OVERSIGHT OVER THE UTILITY AND DECISIONS THAT THEY'RE MAKING AND TYING A LOT OF THOSE DECISIONS AND STANDARDS. TO PUBLIC SAFETY SO WHAT THIS BILL IS INTENDING TO DO IS TAKE A LOOK AT THAT COMPENSATION. AND MAKE SURE THAT IT IS ALIGNED. AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE ANALYSIS ON PAGE TEN OFFER SOME SUGGESTIONS WE'RE CLOSELY ALIGNING THIS BILL NOW TO THOSE SUGGESTIONS. IN ORDER. TO LIMIT IT TO THE LARGEST OF THE UTILITIES AND THIS IS ESSENTIALLY P. JEANNIE AND THIS NOTION OF OF THIS. ADDING A NOTION OF THE SPECIAL MASTER WHICH WORKED VERY SUCCESSFULLY UNDER THE TARP PROGRAM THE TROUBLED ASSET RELIEF PROGRAM. THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT MODEL AS IT WAS LOOKING AT AT HAVING TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE TO VERY LARGE CORPORATIONS TROUBLE CORPORATIONS. RESPONDING TO THE NEED. FOR PUBLIC ASSISTANCE BUT YET HAVING APPROPRIATE LEVELS OF CONTROL OVER DECISIONS THAT WERE BEING MADE WHAT THE SPECIAL MASTER IN THIS CASE WOULD BE DOING WOULD BE AN INDIVIDUAL APPOINTED BY. THE GOVERNOR IN A CASE WHERE THERE ARE COMPENSATION THAT IS BEING SUGGESTED AND WHERE THE UTILITY IS RELYING ON SOMETHING LIKE THE SB NINE A ONE FORMAT OR GOING TO THE RATE PAYERS. TO HELP THEM DEFRAY SOME OF THE COSTS THAT THEY HAVE OCCURRED BASED ON THE PUBLIC SAFETY ISSUES THAT HAVE ARISEN AND THEN. LIABILITIES THAT THAT ACCRUE FROM THOSE IF THEY'RE LOOKING FOR HELP UNDER THOSE STRUCTURES. WE'RE ASKING THAT WITH THIS BILL WOULD ASK FOR THAT A SPECIAL MASTER BE. BE APPOINTED TO LOOK AT COMPENSATION DECISIONS WITHIN THAT CORPORATION. AND INSURE THAT THOSE DECISIONS ARE TIED TO THE THEIR PUBLIC SAFETY GOALS THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS IS DOING IN FACT IT. TAYLOR'S VERY NICELY WITH THE GOVERNOR NEWSOME. I WAY RELEASES WRECK FORCE REPORT SAYING THAT EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION IS A CRITICAL ASPECT OF WHAT NEEDS TO BE LOOKED AT AND PRESIDENT PICKER HAD SAID AS WE WENT THROUGH IN THE LEGISLATURE SB NINE A ONE AND AND OTHER ISSUES OVER THE LAST. YEAR THAT THE THE LEVERS TO PC NEEDS TO HAVE WHICH TECH TO LOOKING AT COMPENSATION ENSURING THAT IS FAIR AND THAT pTIED TO THE PUBLIC SAFETY GOALS. IS A VERY IMPORTANT LEVER FOR THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION TO GO THROUGH THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH IN THIS BILL. AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTES. IS THERE A DO YOU HAVE NO WITNESSES FOREVER. IS THERE ANYONE HERE TO SPEAK IN FAVOR THE BILL. HEY ARE THEIR WITNESSES TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION. MISTER CHAIRMAN REMEMBER SCOTT WET SHOULD BE HALF THE CALIFORNIA COALITION OF UTILITY EMPLOYEES. WELL WE HAVE GREAT RESPECT FOR THE AUTHOR. I FIND THIS BILL TO BE QUITE REMARKABLE [inaudible] UNNECESSARY [inaudible] REDUNDANT. AND PATENTLY. ILLEGAL. FIRST OF ALL WE PASSED LEGISLATION WHICH MY ORGANIZATION SPONSORED. BY. ASSEMBLYMEMBER GONZALEZ COUPLE YEARS AGO AB TWELVE SIXTY SIX REFERENCED IN THE NOW SAYS. WHICH ALREADY ALLOWS THE P. YOU SEE. TO PUT INTO ESCROW -- COMPENSATION. IN THE EVENT THAT THE UTILITIES FOUND HER VIOLATED THE SAFETY ORDER. LAST YEAR WE PASSED SB NINE A ONE WHICH SAYS NO MORE RATE PAYER FUNDED. EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION. THIS LEGISLATURE OF CALIFORNIA CANNOT APPOINT A MASTER. TO REGULATE THE CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENT BETWEEN A PRIVATE CORPORATION AND ITS EMPLOYEES THAT IS THE RECIPIENT DID. IT ALSO IS AN ILLEGAL. IMPAIRMENT OF CONTRACT. IT'S IT'S SIMPLY NOT DOABLE OR WORKABLE. IT CONFLICTS WITH WITH WITH. STATE AND FEDERAL LAW. IT ISN'T JUST. MUST SUGGEST THAT YOU'RE OF THE AFFIRMATIVE ACTION OFFICER FOR P. JEANNIE. AND YOU'VE DONE AN INCREDIBLE JOB. OF BRINGING THE INCREASE IN THE RANKS OF WOMEN AND MINORITIES INTO THE COMPANY. BUT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE YOUR COMPENSATION PUT ASIDE FOR FIVE YEARS BECAUSE OF THE PERFORMANCE OF THE COMPANY FOR ACTIONS FOR WHICH YOU HAVE NO CONTROL. IT SIMPLY DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. UNFORTUNATELY AS MUCH AS EVERYBODY WANTS A POUND OF FLESH AND I BELIEVE ME A POUND OF FLESH HAS BEEN. GOTTEN. THE EXECUTIVES THAT RAN P. JEANNIE UP UNTIL TWENTY EIGHTEEN ARE ALL GONE. AND NOW WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS ATTRACT THE BEST AND THE BRIGHTEST SO WE CAN HAVE A COMPANY COME OUT OF BANKRUPTCY THEY CAN PERFORM. TO ALL OF YOUR EXPECTATIONS IN THIS TYPE OF WAS LEGISLATION WELL WHAT MAKES FOR GREAT PRESS RELEASES. WON'T ACCOMPLISH THAT IN AND WILL BE CHALLENGED THE DAY IT BECOMES IN THE PRINT AND WILL BE THROWN OUT FOR ALL THE LEGAL REASONS OR VERY. AT ADEQUATELY OUTLINED IN THE ANALYSIS SO FOR ALL THOSE REASONS. WE WOULD URGE YOU KNOW OF A BEFORE THE OTHERS SPEAK -- STONE WE DID HAVE AMENDMENTS AND THE MINUTES I THINK ADDRESS SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WERE RAISED BY THE SPEAKER -- BUT I DON'T THINK YOU'RE GONNA GET ON THE RECORD THAT YOU'RE ACCEPTING THEIR MEMBERS YES I AM ACCEPTING THOSE AMENDMENTS WE ARE ALIGNING IT. THIS BILL TO THE DESCRIPTION IN THE ANALYSIS AND THE AMENDMENTS THAT YOU'RE. THAT YOU ABOUT SPECIFIC ABSOLUTELY. SHOULD YOUR UNFORTUNATELY YOU CAN'T AMEND AROUND A RISA AND THAT IS THE FATAL FLAW THANK YOU NEXT WEEK. YES OVER THERE IN CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE -- I ECHO THE COMMENTS MADE BY MY COLLEAGUE HERE WE ALSO CAN CONCERNS OVER ARCHING CONCERNS WITH RESPECT TO A BILL THAT DOES REGULATE THE PRIVATE COMPENSATION BETWEEN A PRIVATE EMPLOYER AND A PRIVATE EMPLOYEE. A TO THE EXTENT THAT IT DOES FILE AT THE CONCERT THAT TAKINGS CLAUSE IN THE CONTRACT CLAUSE OF THE BOTH THE STATE AND THE FEDERAL CONSTITUTION. I UNDERSTAND AND I APPRECIATE THE ANALYSIS IS -- STATEMENT THAT THERE IS NO CASE LAW IN EFFECT ON THESE ISSUES. THAT IS BECAUSE CALIFORNIA'S NOT ENACTED SUCH AN OVER REACHING LAW -- TO BE CHALLENGED AND TO BE SUBJECT TO CASE LAW SO FOR THESE REASONS AND FOR OTHERS WEEK -- RESPECTFULLY OPPOSITION. CAN CAL'S WITH SAN DIEGO GAS ELECTRIC -- WE'RE STILL REVIEWING THE AMENDMENTS BUT I JUST WANT TO NOTE -- WE HAVE ALREADY IN PLACE EVERY INCENTIVE TO OPERATE A SAFE SYSTEM IF YOU LOOK BACK WE HAD FIRES IN. TWO THOUSAND SEVEN OUR MANAGEMENT GAVE OUR EMPLOYEE BASE A DIRECTIVE AND IT WAS TO AVOID FUTURE WILDFIRES WE'VE DONE EVERYTHING WE CAN OF THE LAST ELEVEN YEARS. LAST YEAR -- MISTER WEST REFERENCED PROVISIONS OF NINE A ONE THAT CONCERN US ABOUT IT COMPENSATION BY UTILITY OFFICERS ALL BEING RAPED -- SHAREHOLDER FUNDED. FOR US WE LOOK AT THE I. T. OFFICER OTHER PEOPLE WHO HAVE. NO SAY IN. A LOT OF THIS IT'S GOING ON IN THOSE EMPLOYEES ARE NOW COMPENSATE ENTIRELY BY SHAREHOLDERS. SO WHILE WE CONTINUE TO REVIEW THE AMENDMENTS WOULD WANT TO EXPRESS OUR CONCERN GOING IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL DOES APPEAR BEFORE THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU RICHARD. YES CHAIRMAN BURST REBEKAH LEE ON BEHALF OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON WE DO HAVE AN OPPOSE POSITION BASED ON THE BILL AND FRIENDS -- WE ARE STILL CONCERNED WITH SOME THAT THE PRESIDENT THAT COULD BE SET WITH THESE AMENDMENTS BUT WE DO LOOK FORWARD TO REVIEWING THE AMENDMENTS BEFORE WEEKEND REASSESS OPPOSITION THANK YOU. THANK YOU SPEAKING OPPOSITION WILL TURN BACK TO THE COMMITTEE AND ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. DR COURT YEAH I DO AGREE WITH THE OPPOSITION -- THERE'S A COUPLE OF THINGS GOING ON HERE FIRST OF ALL. TALKED ABOUT TARP IN THE TARP CASE IT WAS EASY TO DO THIS BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT WAS BAILING OUT THE COMPANIES. AND SO OF COURSE YOU COULD DECIDE LOTS OF THINGS. HAD WE PRESENT PREVENTED P. JEANNIE FROM GOING BANKRUPT. BY STANDING BASICALLY GUARANTEEING THEIR DEBTS WHICH IS SOMETHING I SUGGESTED TO THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE WE COULD APPOINT THE BOARD. MAYBE ALL OF THEM SHOULD BE SAFETY ENGINEERS WE COULD REPORT WE COULD GET A POINT THAT OF THE COMPANY. THAT'S SOMETHING WE COULD HAVE DONE NOW THEY'RE IN BANKRUPTCY I I DO HAVE CONSIDERABLE DOUBT THAT THIS CAN BE ENFORCED. BUT I THINK THAT. WE MADE A MISTAKE IN NINE OH ONE BECAUSE WE GAVE UP THE ABILITY TO TELL. THE HEAD OF THE COMPANY WHAT HIS -- AND WE'RE TRYING TO FIX IT WITH ANOTHER BELL I'D SAY WHICH JUST GET RID OF NINE OO THAT PROVISION OF NINE A ONE YOU WERE TRYING TO FIX ONE MISTAKE WITH ANOTHER. ARM I AGREE THAT EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION WRIT LARGE ACROSS THIS COUNTRY IS ABOUT A HUNDRED TIMES BIGGER THAN IT SHOULD BE. BUT IN THE END PGP. IS A VERY TROUBLED COMPANY IT'S GONNA BE VERY DIFFICULT TO RECRUIT SOMEONE THEY HAVE RECRUITED SOMEONE. AND FRANKLY YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET SOMEBODY TO GO IN THERE CHEAP MAYBE MY SON WOULD TAKE THE JOB BUT I DON'T THINK -- I DON'T THINK SOMEBODY WHO HAS EXPERIENCE RUNNING UTILITY WOULD GO IN THERE FOR CHEAP. I DO NOW WITH THE SPECIAL MASTER THAT THEY PROBABLY LOOK AT THAT IN THE END THE COMPENSATION WOULD BE FAIRLY HIGH. SO I'M JUST NOT GOING TO SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY -- WOULD YOU LIKE TO RESPOND TO THE THE COMMENTS OF OPPOSITION -- BUT LET ME ALSO SAY BEFORE YOU DO THAT. I THINK WE ALL. KIND OF WENT THROUGH A COMMITTEE WENT THROUGH IN OUR OWN MINDS. THE ACTIONS IN THE WORK DONE BY THE NINE A ONE ON NINE A ONE LAST YEAR AND ADDRESSING THIS ISSUE -- AND I I THINK THAT WHAT WE WERE REALLY. WELL WHAT I WAS REALLY COMING DOWN TO IS TRYING TO BALANCE SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED. BUT ALSO ARE RECOGNIZED IN THIS INSTANCE THERE IS THIS -- UTILITY THAT HAS IN MANY WAYS DEMONSTRATED A LOT OF DISREGARD. FOR SAFETY. AS IT RELATES -- TO THE TERRITORY AND TERMS OF WHICH IT REPRESENTS AND THE DECISION MAKERS THE CULTURES AT THE TOP -- AND SO I I THINK WE TRIED TO PUT IN HERE SOME PROVISIONS THAT -- SOME AMENDMENTS THAT WOULD THE SPECIAL MASTER BECAUSE I DON'T DISAGREE WITH DOCTOR QUIRK I THINK WE ALL. WANT TO SEE GOING FORWARD THAT THIS THIS -- UTILITY HAS THE OPPORTUNITY -- TO GET BACK ON ITS FEET AND DO THE RIGHT THING AND AND BE SUCCESSFUL -- BUT I THINK -- THE AUTHORS MASON ALSO IMPORTANT POINTS THAT -- NEED TO BE RECOGNIZED AND AND SO WE TRIED TO CRAFT -- AMENDMENTS TO ADDRESS THIS THE INTENT ANSWERED WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH -- MINDFUL OF SOME OF THE CONCERNS ARE REYES AND HOPEFULLY WE DID A GOOD JOB IN DOING THAT. THE TURNOUT. I THANK YOU A LOT OF THE OPPOSITION WAS TO THE INITIAL ATTEMPT TO TRY AND GET OUR HANDS AROUND THIS ISSUE. THERE'S NO LIMITATION ON THE COMPENSATION WHAT THIS DOES IS IT PUTS IN PLACE A SPECIAL MASTER TO BE ABLE TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE TYING DECISIONS AROUND COMPENSATION TO THE PUBLIC SAFETY GOALS WE HAVE. A CORPORATION THIS WOULD SENSE TO BE ONLY APPLYING THE P. JEANNIE AT THIS POINT. BECAUSE OF THE THE WAY THAT THE UTILITY IS GOING TO BE TO FIND THE SIZE THE IMPACT THAT IT HAS AND GIVEN ITS TRACK RECORD OVER THE LAST NUMBER OF YEARS OF FAILING TO MEET ITS PUBLIC SAFETY OBLIGATIONS. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE PERFORMANCE OF OTHER UTILITIES ACROSS THE STATE AND THEIR RESPONSE TO PREVIOUS FIRES? AND DISASTERS THAT THAT THEY HAD TO ADDRESS THEY PUT INTO PLACE RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS THEY PUT IN PLACE A NUMBER OF THINGS TO ENSURE THAT THEIR ACTIVITIES ARE. MEET THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF PUBLIC SAFETY P. JEANNIE ABSOLUTELY FAILED TO DO THAT AND NOW HAS COME TO THE STATE. TO FIND SOME WAY TO RELIEVE THEMSELVES A LIABILITY TO GET. US TO BAIL THEM OUT AT SOME POINT. THERE WERE STILL WE HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO TO SOLVE THE ISSUE OF MAKING SURE THEY THAT THE GRID STAYS APPROPRIATE OR PROVIDING ELECTRICITY EVERYONE'S HOME. AND HAVING A PROVIDER THAT THAT IS VIABLE WITH IN CALIFORNIA AND IF THEY DON'T MAKE APPROPRIATE DECISIONS ABOUT HOW THEY'RE GOING TO KEEP THE PUBLIC SAFE AND EXPECT US. TO CONTINUE TO STEP UP AND HELP THEM OUT WHEN THEY'VE MADE INCORRECT DECISIONS. THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE AS A LEGISLATURE SHOULD NOT STAND FOR WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS IT CREATES A SPECIAL MASTER WHICH IS LEGAL AND IS APPROPRIATE FOR US TO DO. BECAUSE AS AS A UTILITY THAT SIT SORT OF BETWEEN A PUBLIC ENTITY IN A PRIVATE ENTITY THE STATE HAS A SIGNIFICANT INTEREST ESPECIALLY NOW THAT THEY'VE GONE INTO BANKRUPTCY. A SIGNIFICANT INTEREST IN HOW THE COMPANY COMES OUT OF BANKRUPTCY WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE AND HOW THEY CONDUCT THEMSELVES IN PREVENT. CATASTROPHES TO THE EXTENT THEY CAN MOVING FORWARD AND SO THEY THE EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION THE SPECIAL MASTER. WOULD NOT BE PUTTING LIMITATIONS ON COMPENSATION AT THIS POINT BUT IS TYING THAT COMPENSATION DECISIONS TO THEM MEETING THEIR PUBLIC SAFETY GOAL. THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE LOOKING AT IS APPROPRIATE FOR THE PC TO BE ABLE IS WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR THEM TO DO TO BE OF THE POINT THAT PUBLIC MASTER THIS IS. THAT SOME THE ADMINISTRATION WILL BE LOOKING AT AND GET TIES IN WITH STATEMENTS THAT PRESIDENT PICKERS MADE ANTIS IN WITH WHAT THE GOVERNOR IS TRYING TO DO. IT LOOKING AT THE PANOPLY OF ISSUES THAT THEY NEED TO LOOK AT AND HAVING GETTING OUR HANDS AROUND IT COMPENSATION DECISIONS EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION DECISIONS. THAT THE UTILITY IS MAKING. POTENTIALLY TO THE DETRIMENT OF THE SAFETY OF RATE PAYERS AND PEOPLE ACROSS CALIFORNIA WHO ARE RELYING ON THAT UTILITY TO BE AS ROBUST AS THEY ARE AND AS PUBLIC. PUBLIC SAFETY MINDED AS THEY CAN BE AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT THEY HAVE ABSOLUTELY FAILED ON OF THE LAST NUMBER OF YEARS LEADING US TO THE TO THE QUANDARY'S THAT HAVE BEEN PUT BEFORE THIS. LEGISLATION THIS LEGISLATURE. AND THE GOVERNOR THIS BILL IS A WAY FOR US TO ENSURE THAT DECISIONS ARE BEING MADE WITH RESPECT. TO EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION GIVING TOOLS TO THE P. YOU SEE TO ENSURE THAT THOSE DECISIONS GET MADE AND BE ABLE TO TIE THOSE DECISIONS TO THEIR PUBLIC SAFETY GOALS. GIVING US A LITTLE BIT MORE SHARDS THAT AS P. JEANNIE MAKES THEIR DECISIONS THEY WILL BE KEEPING THE PUBLIC AS SAID ABSOLUTELY POSSIBLE [inaudible] ISRAEL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND THANK YOU TO THE AUTHOR FOR THIS REALLY GREAT. CONVERSATION IF I MAY I JUST WANTED TO SHARE SOME INFORMATION TO EXECUTIVE PAYOUTS. SO -- TO WRITE THE RECENTLY A GEISHA WILLIAMS WHO IS THE FORMER P. JENNY CO LEFT THE COMPANY WITH THE TWO POINT FIVE MILLION CASH SEVERANCE -- AS SHE LEFT THE COMPANY. YES LEE THEPREVIOUS CO PGA ANY NETWORK -- STRAPLESS WHO RETIRED IN SEPTEMBER OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN RECEIVED A SIX POINT NINE MILLION CASH PAYOUT. OBVIOUSLY BEFORE THAT. FORMER PGA ANY SEAL PETER DARBY RECEIVED THIRTY FOUR POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS EVEN THOUGH HE WAS IN CHARGE OF THE COMPANY DURING THE LETHAL EXPLOSION IN SAN BRUNO. FORMER PGA ANY CO ANTHONY EARLY WHO WAS A MILLION PREDECESSOR RECEIVED TEN POINT FOUR MILLION AS HE RETIRED AS A RETIRED IN EARLY. TWENTY SEVENTEEN DURING A TIME IN WHICH P. GINNY HAS BEEN ACCUSED OF ALLEGEDLY FALSIFYING GAS SYSTEM RECORDS. SO WE ARE IN A VERY INTERESTING TIME IN TERMS OF WHAT DOES THAT MEAN IN TERMS OF HOW DO WE TRULY PUT. CALIFORNIANS OVER THE PROFITS OF A FEW EXECUTIVES. AND SO THANK YOU FOR THIS -- REALLY IMPORTANT CONVERSATION AS TO THE FUTURE OF OUR STATE AND REALLY THE LIVES THAT HAVE BEEN LOST THROUGH THE FIRES. THE INCOMPETENCE THAT WE HAVE SEEN. AND REALLY AT THE END OF THE DAY HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT THE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE LOST THEIR HOMES. THEIR LIVELIHOODS FAMILIES. ACROSS THE STATE. HAVE SOME KIND OF JUSTICE WITH THE WITH THE LEGISLATORS THAT SERVE THIS GREAT STATE. THANK YOU THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. MRS JOAN IAM READING THE COMEDIAN ELSE'S HERE AND I I JUST WANT TO CONFIRM MY UNDERSTANDING HERE THE THIS BILL MEASURES X. ACCESS COMPENSATION AWARDED TO EXECUTIVES AS THE PERCENTAGE. BY WHICH EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION INCREASES OVER. RANK AND FILE EMPLOYEES. COMPENSATION IN A GIVEN YEAR. NO IT NO LONGER DOES THAT THOSE PROVISIONS ARE NOT THERE WERE ESSENTIALLY CREATING OF A PROCESS WITH A SPECIAL MASTER MODEL ON THE TARP PROGRAM TO GIVE YOU SEE. THE ABILITY TO HAVE SOME. AUTHORITY IN CONVERSATION DECISIONS AND TYING THOSE. TO PUBLIC SAFETY DECISIONS OF THE CORPORATION MIX YEAH RIGHT. WELL I WAS GONNA SAY THAT. TO I WOULD SUPPORT THE ORIGINAL LANGUAGE THANK YOU. GIVEN THAT. YOU KNOW WHILE WE OFTEN STATE OUR SUPPORT [inaudible] FOUR ESPECIALLY GOOD UNION JOBS. AND WEEK COMPLAIN ABOUT ACCESS COMPENSATION ACT ACCESS EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION -- I DO HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT. THE LEGALITY OF THIS. BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT POLITICAL STATEMENT -- I SHARE THE OUTRAGE THAT MANY IN THE PUBLIC. EXPRESSED ABOUT. THE REPORTS OF WHAT I WOULD CONSIDER ACCESS EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION -- IN LIGHT OF P. CHENEY'S. PUBLIC SAFETY RECORD. AND BECAUSE OF THAT PUBLIC STATEMENT I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL. THANK YOU AND WE WERE EXACTLY TRYING TO DO THAT IT WAS TO BE TO FIND A WAY THAT WE CAN ENSURE THAT THE CORPORATION WOULD NOT OVERLY. COMPENSATE THEIR EXECUTIVES. THE ORIGINAL BILL ABSOLUTELY ALLOWED THE RANK AND FILE AND AND REGULAR POLICE TO BE COMPENSATED SEE BONUSES BUT WHAT WE DIDN'T WANT TO SEE. AT THE EXPENSE OF YOU KNOW WE TALK ABOUT SHAREHOLDER DOLLARS AGAIN TALK ABOUT RATE PAYER DOLLARS BUT ULTIMATELY THIS COMES FROM THE RATE PAYERS BECAUSE THAT. THE SHAREHOLDER DOLLARS. IT REALLY IS. COMES OUT OF THE PROFITABILITY OF THE COMPANY WE ALL PAY FOR THAT. GOING IN. THEN THAT PROFITABILITY IS WHAT SUPPOSED TO BE THERE TO PAY FOR THE THE WILD FIRES AND AND THE LIABILITY THAT WE HAVE PREVENTED THEM FROM DIPPING DOWN INTO. RATE PAYERS TO DO UNDER SB NINE A ONE WE'VE NOW ALLOW THEM TO CONTEMPLATE BEING ABLE TO OFFSET SOME OF THESE CHARGES OFF AGAIN ON RIGHT PAIR SO WE ARE BLURRING THOSE LINES. IF WE'RE GOING TO ALLOW THAT AND IF WE'RE GOING TO THEN ALLOW THIS CORPORATION TO MAKE EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION DECISIONS THIS IS WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO GET AT AND THIS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE. TO THE COMMITTEE TO TRY AND FIND A WAY THAT WE WERE. ASKING THE THE CORPORATION TO HOLD BACK BECAUSE AFTER THEIR LAST BANKRUPTCY BEFORE THEY'RE OUT OF THEIR LAST BANKRUPTCY THEY PAID SOME HUNDRED EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS IN EXECUTIVE BONUSES. AND THIS IS TO THE DETRIMENT OF THE RANK AND FILE THIS IS DEFINITELY THE DETRIMENT OF THE REPAIRS THAT'S MONEY THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN INVESTING INTO PUBLIC SAFETY WE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE SEEN THEM DO THAT. BY PUTTING THE SPECIAL MASTER NOW THAT GIVES US GIVES A PC LITTLE ADDITIONAL OVERSIGHT INTO THOSE DECISIONS THAT GET MADE AND MAKE SURE THAT BEFORE THEY'RE PAYING THEIR EXECUTIVES. VERY HIGH COMPENSATION NUMBERS THAT THEY'RE MEETING THEIR PUBLIC SAFETY OBLIGATIONS THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL DOES AT THIS POINT. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS. IS THERE A MOTION [inaudible] SECOND. IT'S BEEN WITHIN SECONDS. OF STONE. WE APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR YOUR FOCUS -- AND AND WE APPRECIATE YOUR ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS -- TO TRY TO HELP THANK YOU STRUCTURE IN A WAY THAT ALLOWS US TO MOVE FORWARD AS BEST WE CAN UNDERSTANDING SOME OF THE OTHER ISSUES OUT THERE SO.

THANK YOU MISTER. THAT HAS SIX VOTES THAT A BILL IS ON CALL [inaudible] THIS FRIEDMAN. YOU'RE HERE TO PRESENT ON A. B. FIFTEEN SIXTEEN I AM. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'D LIKE TO START BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS I'D LIKE TO COMMIT TO WORKING ON DEVELOPING AS WELL A MORE ROBUST NOTIFICATION TO PROPERTY OWNERS ABOUT THE NEW RIGHT TREE RIGHT PLACE REQUIREMENTS AT THE BILL OVER CREEK THE BILL CREATES. I ALSO WILL COMMIT TO WORKING WITH YOUR STAFF. AT THE UTILITIES AND CAL FIRE ON GETTING THE ENFORCEMENT PROVISIONS OF THE BILL RIGHT AND WE KNOW THAT WE'VE GOT A WAYS TO GO BUT IT'S AN IMPORTANT CONVERSATION TO KEEP HAPPENING. OF COURSE WE ALL KNOW ABOUT THE OF WILDFIRES THAT WE'VE HAD IN THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS WITH OVER THREE MILLION ACRES BURNING AT HIGH SEVERITY WILD FIRES OR FIRES IN OVER THIRTY THOUSAND STRUCTURES BEING DESTROYED. OVER ONE HUNDRED CALIFORNIANS HAVE DIED FROM WILDFIRES IN THE LAST TWO YEARS -- LAST YEAR ARM MY AB TWENTY NINE ELEVEN AND OF THE PARTS OF THE WILD FIRED RECOVERY LEGISLATIVE PACKAGE MADE IMPORTANT IMPROVEMENTS TO CALIFORNIA'S FIRE PREVENTION EFFORTS. HOWEVER THERE ARE DIFFERENT ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITIES TO IMPROVE THE FIRE SAFETY OF CALIFORNIA COMMUNITIES YOU KNOW A LOT OF WHAT WE SAW IN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS WE'RE BUILDINGS THAT WERE NEWER STRUCTURES WITH. NEW CODES I'M BURNING AND WE COME TO REALIZE THAT WHAT WE DO WITH LANDSCAPING IS ALSO A BIG PART TO BEING FIRE SAFE. THIS BILL WILL IMPROVE DEFENSIBLE SPACE COMPLIANCE AND PHASE IN A NEW NON COMBUSTIBLES HOME REQUIRE THE USE OF RIGHT TREAT RIGHT PLACE FOR FUTURE PLANTING UNDER ELECTRICAL LINES AND AND AND HIGH FIRE HAZARD AREAS. THIS WILL REDUCE UTILITY VEGETATION MANAGEMENT COSTS AND WILDFIRES. CREATE A GUIDE BOOK TO PROVIDE LANDOWNERS OPTIONS FOR VEGETATION THAT WOULD NEVER GROW INTO ENERGIZED CONDUCTORS AND CAUSE FIRES. BOTH SDG ANY AND CAL POLY ALREADY OFFER RESOURCES ON WHICH TREES AND SHRUBS TO PLANT UNDER UTILITY LINES. MODERNIZE CAL FIRES REQUIREMENTS TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ON FIRE PREVENTION AND APPROPRIATE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT. WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT IS LIVE LIVE I'M SORRY LIZ FORSBERG WITH THE NATURE CONSERVANCY AND MICHAEL DE DELEO SYSTEM FORRESTER FOR S. D. G. ANY. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THE BILL. CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS LIZ FORSBERG MANY ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR POLICY FOR THE NATURE CONSERVANCY WE ARE HERE TODAY IN STRONG SUPPORT OF AB. FIFTEEN SIXTEEN DID YOU CONSERVANCY IS AN ACTIVE MEMBER OF THE FIRED UP TO COMMUNITIES LEARNING NETWORK A NATIONAL GROUP WORKING TO BUILD SUSTAINABLE WILDFIRE RESILIENCE CAPACITY IN FIRE PRONE COMMUNITIES. THE COLLISION IS COMMITTED TO HELPING PEOPLE IN WILDLAND URBAN INTERFACE AT DOT TO LIVING WITH WILDFIRE AND REDUCE THEIR RISK FOR DAMAGE. FOR COMMUNITIES ESTABLISHING HIGH RESPIRE AREAS WE MUST MAKE THEM MORE RESILIENT THROUGH FIRE SAFE BUILDING STANDARDS DEFENSIBLE SPACE PROGRAMS EVACUATION PLANNING AND PREVENTION OF HUMAN BECAUSE TECHNICIANS. AB FIFTEEN SIXTEEN MAKES IMPORTANT CHANGES TO IMPROVE DEFENSIBLE SPACE REQUIREMENTS AND COMPLIANCE ENSURING THAT WE ARE ADOPTING CALIFORNIA TO DEAL WITH THE ESCALATING THREATS OF FIRE. AB FIFTEEN SIXTEEN ALSO REQUIRES CAL FIRE AND THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION TO DEVELOP A GUIDEBOOK TO HELP LANDOWNERS KNOW HOW TO MANAGE BUT TATIAN UNDER LOGICAL LINES AND HIGH HOT FIRE HAZARDS OWNS. THE PUBLIC AWARENESS CAMPAIGN WILL HELP REDUCE MANAGEMENT COSTS AND REDUCE VEGETATION CONTACTS WITH LINES. LET'S STOP MAKING HISTORY AND START MAKING OUR COMMUNITIES MORE FIRE RESILIENT THROUGH IMPORTANT MEASURES LIKE A. B. FIFTEEN SIXTEEN WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAMBERS NIGGLING THAT LANDED GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS FOR SENEGAL GAS ELECTRIC JUST WANTED TO DO SO OUR TECHNICAL EXPERT. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. MY NAME IS MICHAEL DELAY ON THE SYSTEM FORSTER FOR SENDING A GAS ELECTRIC I'VE BEEN AN EMPLOYEE. WITH THE COMPANY FOR THE PAST FIFTEEN YEARS AND PRIOR TO THAT I WAS AN EMPLOYEE OF PACIFIC GAS ELECTRIC FOR NINE YEARS. AND THEIR VEGETATION MENTIONED APARTMENT -- BUT GIVEN THE THE RECENT COMMENTS MAYBE A SHOT OF DISCLOSE THAT BUT WE ARE HERE IN SUPPORT OF AB -- FIFTEEN SIXTEEN IT DOES GIVE US A AND AUGMENTED ABILITY TO IMPROVE OUR ABILITY TO REDUCE THE RISK OF FIRES. WITH REGARD TO VEGETATION MANAGEMENT -- IN THE BILL LASTER AB TWENTY NINE ELEVEN OF THAT DID ACTUALLY GIVE US SOME MORE EMPOWERMENT TO PERFORM THE ACTIVITIES THAT WE NEED. TO CONDUCT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT GONNA HAVE ANY FIRE STARTS. AS A RESULT OF TREAT LINE CONTACTS WHAT AB FIFTEEN SIXTEEN DOES IS IT HELPS ENHANCE THAT ABILITY WE CURRENTLY HAVE. THE RIGHT OBVIOUSLY TO MAINTAIN THE REQUIRED MINIMUM CLEARANCES THAT. ARE REQUIRED BY THE CPC IN THE PUBLIC RESOURCES CODE. THIS ALLOWS US THAT THAT NICHE OPPORTUNITY GET IN THERE AND ROUTE REMOVE TREES THAT ARE INCONSISTENT ARE INCOMPATIBLE WITH POWER LINES SO. RIGHT YOU'RE RIGHT PLACE THAT SORT OF THE MET THE MANTRA AND VEGETATION MANAGEMENT ESSENTIALLY. OF THE WRONG TREE IS IN A TREE THAT HAS ABILITY TO GROW BY ENCROACHMENT. GROWTH OR COULD FALL INTO THE POWER LINES AND CAUSE AN IGNITION AND A FIRE SO THIS ALLOWS US THE ABILITY TO GO IN THERE PROACTIVELY. REMOVE THE TREES AND ALLOWS US TO ENGAGE CUSTOMERS ON THE RIGHT TREE RIGHT PLACE CONCEPT IT ALSO I THINK MORE PROPERLY. PUTS SOME ONUS AND RESPONSIBILITY ON THE CUSTOMERS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE DOING THEIR PART TO MAKE SURE THAT THEIR PROPERTY IS SAFE AND ARE JEOPARDIZING. THEIR NEIGHBORS AT THE RISK OF A CATASTROPHIC FIRES SO WE LOOK AT THIS AS AN ENHANCEMENT TO OUR CURRENT OPERATIONS AND IT GIVES THAT EXTRA ABILITY TO DO WHAT WE NEED. TO YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS. I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT AB THIRTEEN SIXTY TWO WHICH SEEKS TO HAVE THE THE P. YOU SEE. ENSURE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. HAVE FULL ACCESS TO ACCURATE INFORMATION WHEN CONSIDERING THE FORMATION OF A CC A PROGRAM IN THEIR JURISDICTION. I LIKE TO START BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR HARD WORK. IN TWENTY ELEVEN IN ORDER TO PROVIDE CCA'S WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO COMPETE ON A FAIR AND EQUAL BASIS WITH OTHER LOAD SERVING ENTITIES THE P. YOU SEE WAS DIRECTED TO ADOPTED A CODE OF CONDUCT. TO PROVIDE LIMITS ON MARKETING BY UTILITIES. THIS DECISION WAS MEANT TO PREVENT UTILITIES FROM USING THEIR POSITION OR MARKET POWER TO GAIN UNFAIR ADVANTAGES OVER CCA'S AND HAS BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL. IN DOING SO. IN THE YEARS SINCE THE CODE WAS ADOPTED SEVERAL JURISDICTION HAVE IMPLEMENTED CCA PROGRAMS. IN FACT THE GROWTH OF CCA'S. HAS BEEN SO PROLIFIC THAT THEY HAVE. THAT THEY ARE PROJECTED TO SERVE A MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIANS IN THE VERY NEAR FUTURE. I AM CITY THE CITY OF LONG BEACH IS CURRENTLY CONTEMPLATING WHETHER OR NOT TO ADOPT A CC A PROGRAM. AS CITY STAFF WORKS TO COMPLETE A VISIBLE FEASIBILITY STUDY ON CCA FORMATION. THEY ARE FINDING IT DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN CERTAIN DATA AND INFORMATION. THIS IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM CCA FORMATION INVOLVES NUMEROUS COMPLEX ISSUES INCLUDING MEETING STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS AND RESOURCE RESOURCE ADEQUACY INTEGRATED RESOURCE PLANNING LONG TERM RENEWAL AND WE'RE NOT WRONG LONG TERM RENEWABLE CONTRACTING. AND EVEN MORE. CITIES NEED A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF ACCURATE INFORMATION TO FULLY UNDERSTAND THESE RESPONSIBILITIES IN ORDER TO MAKE A FULLY INFORMED DECISION ON WHETHER OR NOT TO ADOPT TO SEE CA PROGRAM. I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR THAT THIS BILL DOES NOT SEEK TO UNDO THE CODE OF CONDUCT. NOR DOES IT UNDERMINE IT'S IMPORTANT PRINCIPLES. RATHER THIS BILL IS INTENDED TO CLARIFY WHAT I BELIEVE IS AN UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE OF THE CODE OF CONDUCT. THE INABILITY FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO OBTAIN ACCURATE INFORMATION. I WHOLEHEARTEDLY AGREE THAT UTILITIES SHOULD NOT. SHOULD NOT USE RATE PAYER FUNDS TO MARKET AGAINST OR EXPRESSLY ADVOCATE AGAINST CCA FORMATION. BUT TO INSIST THAT YOU UTILITIES USE AN INDEPENDENT MARKING UNIVISION WHICH IS COMPLETELY SEPARATE FROM HER OPERATION. TO COMMUNICATE ACCURATE DATA AND INFORMATION TO WITH INFORMATION TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT SIMPLY DOES NOT MAKE SENSE IN FACT THESE INDEPENDENT DIVISIONS. MAY NOT EVEN BE ABLE TO CONVEY SUCH INFORMATION BECAUSE OF THE FIREWALL. THAT EXIST BETWEEN THERE'S THEIR OPERATION AND THE UTILITY. I WANT TO REITERATE THAT WE'RE JUST TALKING ABOUT ACCURATE INFORMATION HERE NOTHING MORE THIS IS ABOUT INFORMATION MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS NOT ADVOCACY. MARKETING OR MARKETING TO CUSTOMERS OR EVEN LOGGING. AB THIRTEEN SIXTY TWO IS A MODEST BILL THAT ENABLES LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO CRITICALLY AND CAREFULLY EVALUATE THE COSTS AND BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH ADOPTING A CC A PROGRAM. GOVERNOR NEW SOME ALSO CALL FOR INCREASED TRANSPARENCY RELATIVE TO CCA'S AND OTHER LOAD SERVING ENTITIES AND IS REPORT ON CALIFORNIA'S ENERGY FUTURE. RELEASED JUST LAST WEEK. HIS RECOMMENDATION EXACTLY IT IS EXACTLY IN LINE WITH A AB THIRTEEN SIXTY TWO SIX TO ACCOMPLISH. TRANSPARENCY AND COMPLETE ACCESS TO ACCURATE INFORMATION. AND WITH THAT MISTER CHAIR IS -- AT LEAST ONE WITNESS HERE TO TESTIFY. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS GOT WHICH ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA COALITION OF UTILITY EMPLOYEES IN THE STATE ASSOCIATION OF ELECTRICAL WORKERS. LIKE TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD -- WE NEGOTIATED THE LEGISLATION IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWO WITH THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER MAKE DIDN'T TO AUTHORIZE. THE CREATIONS OF CCA'S THEY'VE GROWN IN WAYS THAT THAT REALLY NOBODY IMAGINED. BUT WE'VE DONE EXTENSIVE POLLING IN THE LAST TIME WE DID POLLING ABOUT THREE YEARS AGO. WE FOUND IN CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS. OVER 70% OF THE CUSTOMERS WITHIN THOSE CCA'S. STILL BELIEVE THERE ARE CUSTOMERS OF P. JEANNIE. THEY HAD NO IDEA THAT THEY WERE IN SCCA. ALL OF THE CUSTOMERS WHO DID ACTUALLY KNOW THAT THEY WERE A MEMBER OF A CCA. OVER 60% DIDN'T KNOW THAT THEY HAD IT THEY HAD THE OPTION TO OPT OUT. BECAUSE THEY GET SWEPT IN IT'S IT'S NOT OFTEN IS OPT OUT THEY'RE NOT EVEN AWARE OF THOSE BASIC RIGHTS. IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR THE COMMON CONSUMER MUCH LESS MORE SOPHISTICATED PURCHASERS. TO LOOK AT THE DATA THAT'S AVAILABLE AND EVEN KNOW WHAT THE POOR PORTFOLIO MAKE UP IS OF A CCA AND REALLY TRULY HOW CARBON NEUTRAL THEIR THEIR THEIR PORTFOLIO IS -- AND SO WE BELIEVE THAT THIS MEASURE WHICH IS A GOOD GOVERNMENT BLUE SKY TRANSPARENCY PIECE SUNSHINE PIECE OF LEGISLATION AND WE WOULD STRONGLY. URGE AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU -- WILL TAKE OTHERS WHO WERE SPEAKING IN FAVOR. CHEN MEMBERS WERE BACK AT LEE ON BEHALF OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON A WE HAVE A SUPPORT IF AMENDED POSITION AND FIRST I WOULD LIKE TO CLARIFY BASS AND CALIFORNIA EDISON HAS NOT. DONE MARKETING AGAINST THE FORMATION OF CCA'S WE HAVE NOT SUPPORTED ANY STATEWIDE CAMPAIGN OF FIRST WITHOUT REGARD EITHER -- HOWEVER UNDER THE CURRENT CODE OF CONDUCT IT HAS MADE IT DIFFICULT FOR US TO BE ABLE TO POINT TO YOU OR PROVIDE FACTUAL ACCURATE INFORMATION THAT WE BELIEVE OUR LOCAL COUNCIL MEMBERS. SHOULD WEIGH AND CONSIDER TWO IN A STATE CONSIDER WHETHER ON OR NOT TO TAKE ON THE SERIOUS RESPONSIBILITY OF BECOMING OTHERS. RETAIL SERVICE PROVIDER AND SO WE DO BELIEVE THERE'S A BALANCE THAT COULD BE STRUCK ON THIS AND AS IT. AS THE BILL MOVES FOR WHERE WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR AND THE COMMITTEE TO TO STRIKE THAT BALANCE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION THANK YOU. I WILL NOW -- ENTERTAIN ANY OR WELCOME THOSE WHO ARE HERE TO SPEAK OUR WITNESS SINCE IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. HI MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS -- DON GILBERT ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY CHOICE ASSOCIATION. ARE A POSITION ON THE BILL AND PRINT THIS AND OPPOSE POSITION HOWEVER -- WE REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR WORK AND YOUR STAFF'S WORK ON THIS BILL AND ALTHOUGH WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO PUT THE BILL AS AMENDED BEFORE OUR BOARD YET --WE THINK IT'S MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION WE FEEL VERY POSITIVE ABOUT IT. AND WE'RE HOPEFUL THAT WE'LL BE ABLE TO SHORTLY ADOPTING NEW POSITION -- WE MAY SEEK YOUR AUTHOR ABOUT SOME MINOR TWEAKS TO THAT LANGUAGE WILL SEE. ALSO WANTED TO THANK THE AUTHOR AND HIS STAFF IS WE HAD A NICE MEETING YESTERDAY WE UNDERSTAND HIS CONCERNS FOR HIS DISTRICT WE WANNA. FIGHT ASSISTANCE IF WE CAN -- COUPLE OTHER POINTS REGARDING SOME OF THE SUPPORT TESTIMONY INTERESTING TO ME. FOR EXAMPLE EDISON'S TESTIMONY ABOUT THE FACT THAT YOU KNOW THEY JUST WANT TO GET THIS INFORMATION AVAILABLE IT'S NOT AVAILABLE BUT IF YOU READ. THE CPC CODE OF CONDUCT THAT CAME OUT AS BE SEVEN NINETY IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN IT REQUIRES THAT CCA'S AND I USE POST RATE INFORMATION TERROR INFORMATION -- THE PROCUREMENT THEIR PORTFOLIO INFORMATION ALL ON THEIR WEBSITES AND DISTRIBUTED TO ALL THE RATE PAYERS IN THE SERVICE TERRITORY SO IT'S A LITTLE BIT DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND UNLESS THEY'RE NOT COMPLYING WITH THOSE. THAT REQUIREMENT HOW THE INFORMATION WOULD BE AVAILABLE AND THEN LASTLY I'D LIKE TO SAY IF I WAS THE P. EANNIE RATE PAYER IF I WAS A C.. CCA RATE PAYER AND I DISCOVERED AS THE 70% APPARENTLY ACCORDING TO MR WATCH THIS 70% THINK THAT THEIR P. JEANNIE RATE PAYERS AND I DISCOVERED NO LO AND BEHOLD I'M AT SEA. SEE A RATE PAYER TODAY I MIGHT BE PRETTY DARN PLEASED ABOUT THAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU -- IS THERE ANYONE ELSE TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE -- MISTRAL DONALD THE NO COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE OF THIS BILL APPRECIATE YOUR TAKING THE AMENDMENTS. I THINK WHAT WE TRY TO DO IS FIGURE OUT A WAY. TO PRESERVE OF WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO GET OUT FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO BE ABLE TO HAVE MORE INFORMATION -- BUT ALSO RECOGNIZING THE CCS ARE QUITE -- DESIGNED LIKE A NOR OF THE OTHER LSE'S AND SO WITH THAT -- WE APPRECIATE THE YOUR TAKING THE MINUTES AND IF THERE'S A MOTION SO MOVE. IT'S BEEN MOVED AND SECONDED. ROLL CALL ON THE MOTION. AB THIRTEEN SIXTY TWO THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS. HOLDEN HI HOLDEN AYE PATTERSON. PERCENT I BURKE. CARILLO CARILLO AYE CHAN. CHEN I CUNNINGHAM. CUNNINGHAM NOT VOTING EGGMAN. EGGMAN I CRISTINA GARCIA. CRISTINA GARCIA I RODRIGUEZ. RODRIGUEZ I MAYES. MAYES I MERE CG. MURATSUCHI NOT VOTING QUIRK AYE QUIRK AYE RAY S. [inaudible] SANTIAGO TEAM. THE BILL HAS NINE VOTES IT'S OUT WILLIE THE ROLE OPEN. A DOCTOR QUIRK AYE [inaudible] ZERO CARLOS. YOU'RE THE LAST [inaudible] ONE YEAH THANK YOU CHAIRMAN MEMBERS SAID LIKE THANK COMMITTEE STAFFER WORKING WITH MY OFFICE AND THEIR THOUGHTFUL ANALYSIS. I'LL BE ACCEPTING AMENDMENT OUTLINED ON PAGE FIVE OF THE ANALYSIS. AB FIFTEEN EIGHTY FOUR WILL REQUIRE LOAD SERVING ENTITIES TO PAY FOR THE INDIRECT COSTS THAT THEIR PORTFOLIOS HIM. WELL THE EASY WAY TO SAVE THIS IS. YOUR LOAD SERVING AND IT ENTITY. YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR MAKING SURE THERE'S ALWAYS POWER. BUT BECAUSE WE HAVE SO MUCH SOLAR ENERGY. BETWEEN FIVE AND EIGHT O'CLOCK. A HUGE AMOUNT OF GENERATION HAS TO BE BROUGHT ONLINE BECAUSE THE SOUL IS GOING DOWN AND PEOPLE ARE GOING HOW. AND THAT'S THAT'S HUGE. NOW [inaudible] RIGHT NOW. ARE THE I SO OF COURSE. CONTROLS THE ENERGY MARKETS AND IT'S GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT -- TWENTY TO THIRTY GIGAWATTS OF POWER THAT COMES ON BETWEEN FIVE AND EIGHT IS THERE. THEY'RE GONNA ALWAYS MAKE SURE OF THAT THE PROBLEM IS. IF THE LOAD SERVING AMITY HASN'T GOT ENOUGH OF ITS OWN POWER. THEN IT HAS TO BUY ON THE I SO MARKET PLACE. THAT'S JUST MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE THAN BUYING IT IF YOU'VE GOT A LONG TERM CONTRACT YOU HAVE A LONG TERM CONTRACT. YOU KNOW YOU'VE GOT. A SOME SOME SOURCE THAT. BATTERIES OR GAS POWER PLANT WHATEVER YOU CAN GET THAT LOW RATE IF YOU DON'T HAVE THAT AND YOU HAVE TO GO TO THE SPOT MARKET. YOU'RE PAYING THROUGH THE NOSE. NOW RIGHT NOW. WHAT HAPPENS IS THE I. S. O.? WILL SAY THIS IS THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT [inaudible] PEOPLE SPENT. ON BUYING THIS POWER ON THE OPEN MARKET. BUT THAT MONEY. THEN HAS TO BE DISTRIBUTED BY THE C. P. U. C.. AND WHAT THE C. P. U. C. DOES IS IT DOESN'T LOOK AT WHO BOUGHT THE POWER IT SIMPLY SAYS WHAT YOU'RE LOW CHAIR. AND IN THE DAY WHEN THEY WERE THREE MAJOR UTILITIES AND MAYBE THAT MADE SENSE THEY WERE ALL PROBABLY BY IN ABOUT THE SAME AMOUNT. NOW WE HAVE MANY DIFFERENT LOAD SERVING ENTITIES MANY OF WHOM WILL BE NEVER ON THAT MARKET AND PARTICULARLY THE ONES WHO ARE FAIRLY SMALL. BUT THEY'RE NEVER ON THAT MARKET. I CAN THINK OF PASADENA IS MUNICIPAL UTILITY IT'LL NEVER BE ON THAT MARKET. SO THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE TO PAY. FOR SOMEBODY ELSE WHO NEEDED TO GO ON THE SPOT MARKET SO WITH THIS BILL SAYS IS. YOU PAY. FOR WHAT YOU USE. AND IF YOUR LOAD SERVING ENERGY THAT JUST BALLOTS IS EVERYTHING PERFECTLY AS A BELIEVE PASADENA DOES. YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THOSE EXTRA CHARGES. BUT IF YOU'RE LOW CHARITY AN ENTITY. AND YOU BOUGHT A LOT. MAYBE EVERY DAY BETWEEN FIVE AND A YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO PAY THAT BILL. AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT [inaudible] THANK YOU. NO WITNESSES AT THE TABLE. IS THERE ANY YES OKAY -- DO YOU REALLY NEED. TO SEVEN YEAH I THINK WE'VE COVERED IT I THINK YOU HAVE COVERED DEFINITELY. CRESCENTA. AND AGAIN YOU'RE COVERED IT VERY WELL VERY WELL. I ALWAYS FEEL SO MUCH SMARTER AFTER I HEAR YOUR PRESENTATION -- WILL WELCOME ANYONE ELSE WHO'S HERE TO SPEAK IN FAVOR OF THE BILL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MATT FRIEDMAN ON BEHALF OF TURN WE HAVE A SUPPORT IF AMENDED POSITION -- WE HAD TO AMENDMENTS IN OUR LETTER ONE OF WHICH IS INCLUDED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS ONE OF WHICH WAS NOT. OUR AMENDMENTS ONE WHO ARE DESIGNED TO ENSURE THAT NOTHING IN THIS BILL INFRINGES UPON THE AUTHORITY OF THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION TO ADMINISTER ITS EXISTING AUTHORITY UNDER THE INTEGRATED RESOURCE PLANNING AND RESOURCE ADEQUACY PROGRAMS -- AND WE JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THERE'S NO CONFUSION -- ABOUT THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN THIS BILL WHICH WE SUPPORT AND THE EXISTING AUTHORITY UNDER THOSE PROGRAMS YEAH AND THAT WAS ACCIDENTALLY OMITTED AND WE WILL PUT IT IN AS SOON AS WE CAN. THANK YOU MELISSA CORTES ROTH ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA WIND ENERGY ASSOCIATION WE ARE THE SPONSORS OF THE BILL ON NANCY WRITER ARE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AVAILABLE FOR ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS. ARE YOU IN FAVOR AT TWEENER BETWEEN -- OKAY. A TERM MEMBERS WERE BACK ALLEY ON BE HAVE A SON IN CALIFORNIA EDISON WE DON'T YET HAVE AN OFFICIAL POSITION BUT HAVE HAD. A GOOD REALLY GOOD DISCUSSIONS WITH THE SPONSOR IN AUTHORS OFFICE AND CONCEPTUALLY WE ARE IT IS A GOOD CONCEPT TO HAVE SYSTEMS INTEGRATION COST BE BORNE BY THOSE WHO CREATED THOSE COSTS -- BUT THERE'S A LOT OF COMPLEXITY IN HERE AND DOUBLES IS IN THE DETAILS SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHORS TO ADDRESS THEM THANK YOU. THANK YOU. TWENTY AS WELL AT IN SUPPORT WITH THE BIOMASS -- INDUSTRY -- ECHO X.. IS THERE ANYONE HERE IN OPPOSITION SEEING NONE WILL COME BACK TO THE COMMITTEE -- ANY COMMENTS QUESTIONS OF THE AUTHOR MURATSUCHI. YES -- HIGH -- WASN'T SURE IF IT WAS GONNA BE IN OPPOSITION COMING UP BY SO ON THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS EARLIER AT LEAST THAT CAL. CAL CCA WAS -- IS LISTED IN AS OPPOSED HAVE THEY REMOVED THEIR OPPOSITION -- I DON'T KNOW THAT THEY WERE LISTED AS A POSE ARE ARE THEY DELAY WERE LISTED AS A POST OKAY. I HAVEN'T HEARD ANYTHING SENSE OKAY -- OKAY. OKAY -- I THANK YOU DOCTOR QUIRK I I ALSO FEEL A LOT SMARTER AFTER YOUR PRESENTATIONS. AND AND AS AS PART OF YOUR YOUR YOUR HOMEWORK BE ASSIGNED TO ME I I READ YOUR Q. AND A WHICH I FOUND VERY -- HELPFUL AND AND SO THEY THEY ASIA DRESSED MOST OF MY CONCERNS I I WOULD HAVE LOVED TO HAVE IT CONFIRMED BY. THE CAL CCA'S BUT TO GIVEN THAT THEY DON'T SEEM TO BE HERE -- I I I GUESS I SHARE THE CONCERN -- IF THAT TO EDISON RAISED ABOUT THE DEVIL BEING IN THE DETAILS IN IN YOUR LAST A QUEUE IN A YOU YOU HAVE A YOU KNOW -- WHILE I AGREE WITH THE THE IDENTIFICATION OF THE PROBLEM AND THE GENERAL CONCEPT OF YOUR SOLUTION -- THE YOUR YOUR LAST Q. AND A TALKS ABOUT A DESCRIPTION OVER THAN WHAT THE NEW FORMULA WOULD BE TO REPLACE. YOU KNOW THE THAT WOULD THIS BILL RE PROPOSING. AND AND YOUR ANSWER IS THAT THE NEW FORMULA WOULD LIKELY BE BASED ON THE I. SO CAUSATION BASE FORMULA -- COULD YOU WORK AND EXPOUND ON THAT. GET A GOOD AFTERNOON -- THE IN IN TWENTY FOURTEEN THE PEWS THE CHI SO ACTUALLY PROPOSED TO THE P. YOU SEE A METHODOLOGY FOR ALLOCATING FLEXIBLE RESOURCE ADEQUACY. ACOSTA THAT COULD CERTAINLY BE USED -- FOR THOSE RESOURCES WHEN IT COMES THE R. P. SYSTEM INTEGRATION RESOURCES COMING OUT OF YOUR P. I THINK A SIMILAR METHODOLOGY WOULD BE DEVELOPED WHERE. YOU SOCIALLY LOOK AT WHO'S USING THE INTEGRATION RESOURCES AT THE TIME THEY'RE BEING USED AND YOU ALLOCATE ON THAT BASIS. ALL RIGHT -- SO ASICALLY THE THE CAUSATION BASE FORMULA IS. CONCEPTUALLY THE BIG. THE AMOUNT TO WHICH THE LOS SERVING ENTITY THAT. MAY NOT HAVE A BALANCED PORTFOLIO IS CONTRIBUTING TO THE SPOT MARKET COSTS YEAH AND AND I'M SORRY DID INTRODUCE MYSELF NANCY RATE WITH THE CALIFORNIA WIND ENERGY ASSOCIATION -- YOU MY UNDERSTANDING TO TAKE THE TOTAL COST AND YOU WOULD A PORTION IT ACCORDING TO HOW MUCH EACH JEALOUSY IS DRAWING UPON THOSE RESOURCES. SO INSTEAD OF DOING IT ON A LOW CHAIR BASIS YOU DO IT IN PROPORTION TO HOW HOW MUCH THEY'RE ACTUALLY USING THE RESORT. AND THAT CREATES A COST SIGNAL. ABOUT THE INDIRECT COSTS DEAL SEE IS REALLY PUSHING ON THE SYSTEM AND ENCOURAGE THEM NOT TO DO THAT. SO INSTEAD OF A LOW CHAIR AT THE SPOT MARKET SHARE IT DIDN'T KNOW IT'S A IT'S A IT'S A IT'S A CUT CAUSATION IS WHAT THE COULD TURN LEAD BETTER AND CUT. AND CONCEPT I MEAN IT IT'S IN PROPORTION CAUSES THE NEED FOR THE RESOURCE THAT THE CRISIS IS THE TERM CAUSATION. OKAY SO IT'S NOT THE THE TOTAL -- MEGA WATTS -- PURCHASED ON THIS THE SPOT MARKET. IT WOULD BE THE THE ENERGY THAT THE CASE SO -- PULLS FROM THE INTEGRATION RESOURCES THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO MATCH SUPPLY AND DEMAND SO IT'S AN ENERGY COSTS MAKE WHAT HOURS MEGAWATT HOURS. SORRY. OKAY WELL I AGAIN I A CONCEPTUALLY SUPPORT WERE YOU TRYING TO DO I I JUST WANT. TO MAKE SURE THAT -- THAT ERA THE CCA ANALYSIS SO TODAY IBM NOT VOTING BUT TO OKAY SHOULD THE SO THESE Q. AND A WHAT'S BASED UPON THE INFORMATION WE SENT BACK TO THE C. C. A. ENDS ON MAYBE THAT'S NOW THAT. NOW THAT WE'VE ANSWERED THEIR QUESTIONS MAYBE THAT'S NOT. WHY THEY'RE NOT HERE BUT LET ME SAY THIS -- WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE EDISON SAYING THAT THEY WANT TO DEAL WITH THE DETAILS -- BECAUSE FRANKLY -- THEY HAVE SOME REALLY GOOD PEOPLE THERE -- AS IT THE OTHER UTILITIES THE CCA'S WILL BE LISTENED TO ALL THEY HAVE TO SAY -- THE MAIN POINT OF THIS IS JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT. THOSE WHO USE THE RESOURCES PAY FOR IT. THANKS. WOULD YOU LIKE THAT TO BE A CLOSE YES OKAY WE HAVE A MOTION IT'S BEEN SECONDED. I THANK YOU FOR THE BILL DOCTOR QUIRK. RECALLING THE MOST.
