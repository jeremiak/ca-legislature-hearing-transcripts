REFORM OUR POLICE SYSTEM.

01:03:10.353 --> 01:03:12.688

01:03:12.755 --> 01:03:15.892
AND ACCOUNTABILITY. WE ALL HAVE

01:03:15.958 --> 01:03:17.827
RESPECT AND APPRECIATION FOR

01:03:17.894 --> 01:03:19.795
THE MAJORITY OF POLICE OFFICERS

01:03:19.862 --> 01:03:21.531
THAT DO SERVE HONORABLY AND

01:03:21.597 --> 01:03:23.399
THEY PUT THEIR LIVES AT RISK.

01:03:23.466 --> 01:03:25.001
AT THE SAME TIME WE SHOULD NOT

01:03:25.067 --> 01:03:27.703
HAVE TO CHOOSE. OVER THE

01:03:27.770 --> 01:03:29.539
DISPARITIES THAT EXIST WITHIN

OUR SYSTEM. BLACK AND LATINO

01:03:32.475 --> 01:03:35.244

THEM. ADDRESSING THE INJUSTICES

01:03:54.864 --> 01:03:56.599
WITHIN OUR SYSTEM SHOULD NOT BE

01:03:56.666 --> 01:03:58.868
A POLITICAL ISSUE IT SHOULD NOT

01:03:58.935 --> 01:04:00.536
BE A BLACK ISSUE OR LATINO

01:04:00.603 --> 01:04:04.073

SHOULD MATTER TO ALL OF US. A

01:04:11.380 --> 01:04:13.082
CULTURE OF POLICING IN THIS

01:04:13.149 --> 01:04:17.320
COUNTRY MUST CHANGE. SB TWO IS

TRANSPARENCY WE CANNOT REBUILD

01:04:34.270 --> 01:04:36.439
THE PROCESS OF TRUST. WE SHOULD

01:04:36.505 --> 01:04:38.107
NOT HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN

MAKE OUR OMMUNITY SAFER. AND

01:04:51.654 --> 01:04:54.890
FIND COMMON GROUND. AND WITH

01:04:54.957 --> 01:04:57.326

PRESIDENT. THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A

01:05:09.939 --> 01:05:12.842
VERY CHARGED ISSUE OF FOR OUR

01:05:12.908 --> 01:05:14.844
COMMUNITIES AND OUR FRANKLY OUR

01:05:14.910 --> 01:05:16.846
NATION. BUT I WANT TO MAKE

01:05:16.912 --> 01:05:21.284
CERTAIN THAT WE. WE LOOK AT

01:05:21.350 --> 01:05:23.519
THIS- WITH THE SOBRE APPROACH

01:05:23.586 --> 01:05:25.354
AND MAKE CERTAIN THAT- WE ARE

01:05:25.421 --> 01:05:27.290
CREATING THE BEST POLICY TO

01:05:27.356 --> 01:05:28.991
ADDRESS THE COMPELLING IS THAT

01:05:29.058 --> 01:05:31.060
WE HAVE- WITHIN OUR

01:05:31.127 --> 01:05:33.896
COMMUNITIES. I THINK WE'VE

01:05:33.963 --> 01:05:36.532
HEARD THAT- FROM SOME OF THE

01:05:36.599 --> 01:05:38.701
COLORS THAT EVEN THE POLICE

01:05:38.768 --> 01:05:42.238
FORCE LAW ENFORCEMENT FORCE- IT

01:05:42.305 --> 01:05:45.374
IS OPEN TO DECERTIFICATION SO I

01:05:45.441 --> 01:05:46.475
KNOW IT SOUNDS LIKE THERE'S A

01:05:46.542 --> 01:05:49.078
WILLINGNESS. TO ADJUST TO SOME

01:05:49.145 --> 01:05:50.646
OF THE CHANGES THAT ARE NEEDED.

01:05:50.713 --> 01:05:52.181
ALL OF THE CONCERNS THAT I HAVE

01:05:52.248 --> 01:05:54.950
ABOUT THIS IS THAT THIS.

01:05:55.017 --> 01:05:57.119
COMMISSION AND FORGIVE ME I

01:05:57.186 --> 01:05:58.688
DON'T KNOW IF THERE BEEN ANY

01:05:58.754 --> 01:06:00.256
COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS THAT HAVE

01:06:00.323 --> 01:06:02.191
BEEN ADOPTED OR PUT FORWARD. ON

01:06:02.258 --> 01:06:03.793
MAKE CERTAIN THAT MY COMMENTS

01:06:03.859 --> 01:06:06.195
ARE UP TO DATE. I'M NOT AWARE

01:06:06.262 --> 01:06:08.197
OF ANY BUT THAT THIS COMMISSION

01:06:08.264 --> 01:06:12.968
WOULD BE. SUPERIOR TO POST. AND

01:06:13.035 --> 01:06:15.638
I THINK WHEN THE AUTHOR OPENED

01:06:15.705 --> 01:06:18.040
UP WITH HIS COMMENTS HE TALKED

01:06:18.107 --> 01:06:20.910
ABOUT THE ACCREDITING BODIES

01:06:20.976 --> 01:06:22.912
WHETHER BEING THE BAR

01:06:22.978 --> 01:06:24.680
ASSOCIATION OR THE MEDICAL

01:06:24.747 --> 01:06:27.149
BOARDS THAT'S ACTUALLY ACCURATE

01:06:27.216 --> 01:06:28.851
INDIVIDUAL LAWYERS AND DOCTORS

01:06:28.918 --> 01:06:32.221
CAN HAVE THEIR LICENSES REMOVED

01:06:32.288 --> 01:06:32.755
FOR MISCONDUCT AND THAT'S

01:06:32.822 --> 01:06:34.757
ENTIRELY APPROPRIATE. THERE'S

01:06:34.824 --> 01:06:35.424
BAD APPLES IN EVERY SINGLE

01:06:35.491 --> 01:06:37.059
PROFESSION NEED TO BE HELD

01:06:37.126 --> 01:06:39.862
ACCOUNTABLE. I THINK ONE OF THE

01:06:39.929 --> 01:06:41.330
CONCERNS THAT I HAVE HERE IS

01:06:41.397 --> 01:06:42.298
THAT THE COMMISSION THOUGH IT

01:06:42.365 --> 01:06:44.266
IS. GOING TO BE SUPERIOR TO

01:06:44.333 --> 01:06:49.505
POST. AND THAT. THE MAJORITY OF

01:06:49.572 --> 01:06:52.608
THE MEMBERS ON THIS COMMISSION

01:06:52.675 --> 01:06:54.877
COULD BE MADE UP OF INDIVIDUALS

01:06:54.944 --> 01:06:57.880
BUT DO NOT HAVE A BACKGROUND IN

01:06:57.947 --> 01:07:00.282
THE FIELD WEATHER- MY

01:07:00.349 --> 01:07:01.450
UNDERSTANDING THERE'S TWO

01:07:01.517 --> 01:07:02.184
INDIVIDUALS FROM LAW

01:07:02.251 --> 01:07:04.320
ENFORCEMENT POLICE TO FROM

01:07:04.387 --> 01:07:07.623
ACADEMIA. AND THE REST MIGHT BE

01:07:07.690 --> 01:07:09.291
MADE UP OF OTHER APPOINTEES

01:07:09.358 --> 01:07:11.127
INCLUDING THOSE AGGRIEVED BY

01:07:11.193 --> 01:07:13.662
POLICE MISCONDUCT FOR TOTAL I

01:07:13.729 --> 01:07:15.664
THINK OF NINE. BUT IF WE WERE

01:07:15.731 --> 01:07:17.767
TO ADD UP THE INDIVIDUALS THAT

01:07:17.833 --> 01:07:18.934
ARE MANDATED TO HAVE A

01:07:19.001 --> 01:07:21.337
BACKGROUND IN POLICE REFORM OUR

01:07:21.404 --> 01:07:23.506
CRIMINAL JUSTICE. IT WOULD BE A

01:07:23.572 --> 01:07:29.979
MINORITY. ON THE BOARD. AND SO.

01:07:30.045 --> 01:07:31.480
THE CRITERIA THAT I'M LOOKING

01:07:31.547 --> 01:07:35.317
AT HERE. IS TERRIBLY BROAD AND

01:07:35.384 --> 01:07:38.487
IF I MAY SHARE REFERS SOME OF

01:07:38.554 --> 01:07:42.124
THE PROVISIONS. IN THIS BILL IN

01:07:42.191 --> 01:07:43.726
POINT MY EYES ARE GOING EXCUSE

01:07:43.793 --> 01:07:52.635
ME- IS IT. GROUNDS FOR REMOVAL-

01:07:52.701 --> 01:07:55.704
DECERTIFICATION WOULD BE ACTS

01:07:55.771 --> 01:08:02.178
OF DISHONESTY. WE HAVE. ZACKS

01:08:02.244 --> 01:08:06.515
DEMONSTRATING BIAS- BASED ON

01:08:06.582 --> 01:08:10.219
RELIGION OR GENDER IDENTITY.

01:08:10.286 --> 01:08:13.556
AND FELIZ KINDA GOES ON BUT I

01:08:13.622 --> 01:08:14.757
DON'T THINK I UNDERSTAND THE

01:08:14.824 --> 01:08:16.892
RATIONALE FOR MAKING THIS

01:08:16.959 --> 01:08:21.497
COMMISSION SUPERIOR. TO POST.

01:08:21.564 --> 01:08:23.265
WOULD IT NOT MAKE MORE SENSE

01:08:23.332 --> 01:08:25.034
FOR THE COMMISSION TO OFFER

01:08:25.100 --> 01:08:28.037
RECOMMENDATIONS TO POST. AND IT

01:08:28.103 --> 01:08:31.574
MAY BE RE CALIBRATE HELP POST.

01:08:31.640 --> 01:08:33.175
IS DETERMINING WHETHER NOT

01:08:33.242 --> 01:08:36.378
INDIVIDUAL OFFICERS BE HELD

01:08:36.445 --> 01:08:37.746
ACCOUNTABLE WITH IT IF THEY

01:08:37.813 --> 01:08:39.682
LOSE THEIR CERTIFICATION OR OR

01:08:39.748 --> 01:08:43.185
NOT. BUT I'M LOOKING AT WHAT I

01:08:43.252 --> 01:08:46.088
THINK IS. ATTENTIONAL

01:08:46.155 --> 01:08:50.359
ACCOUNTABILITY INSTITUTIONS FOR

01:08:50.426 --> 01:08:50.926
EXAMPLE YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE

01:08:50.993 --> 01:08:53.562
INTERNAL AFFAIRS. YOU COULD

01:08:53.629 --> 01:08:55.164
POSSIBLY HAVE THE DISTRICT

01:08:55.231 --> 01:08:55.631
ATTORNEY'S OFFICE FOR

01:08:55.698 --> 01:08:59.668
MISCONDUCT. IF YOU HAPPEN TO BE

01:08:59.735 --> 01:09:01.237
LIVING IN A CITY OR

01:09:01.303 --> 01:09:03.305
MUNICIPALITY OR A COUNTY THAT

01:09:03.372 --> 01:09:05.341
HAS A POLICE AUDITOR. THAT'S

01:09:05.407 --> 01:09:07.409
NUMBER THREE AND NOW THIS COULD

01:09:07.476 --> 01:09:10.779
BE FOR SO POLICE OFFICER COULD

01:09:10.846 --> 01:09:12.581
BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE BY FOUR

01:09:12.648 --> 01:09:16.085
SEPARATE ENTITIES- WHICH I

01:09:16.151 --> 01:09:17.653
THINK MIGHT BE A BIT MUCH. BUT

01:09:17.720 --> 01:09:22.258
ULTIMATELY. I WOULD THINK THAT

01:09:22.324 --> 01:09:24.460
IF LAW ENFORCEMENT IS WILLING

01:09:24.527 --> 01:09:26.195
TO DISCUSS THIS FURTHER THE

01:09:26.262 --> 01:09:28.330
DECERTIFICATION ISSUE THAT

01:09:28.397 --> 01:09:30.132
MAYBE IT WOULD BE WORSE

01:09:30.199 --> 01:09:32.735
CONTINUING THESE CONVERSATIONS

01:09:32.801 --> 01:09:34.303
SEE WHAT COMMON GROUND COULD

01:09:34.370 --> 01:09:37.273
EXIST. I AM I IMAGINE YOU'VE

01:09:37.339 --> 01:09:40.276
MADE THOSE OVERTURES- BUT

01:09:40.342 --> 01:09:42.645
ULTIMATELY IT MY CONCERN IS

01:09:42.711 --> 01:09:44.179
THAT A COMMISSION LIKE THIS

01:09:44.246 --> 01:09:47.650
SHOULD NOT BE SUPERIOR. FIVE TO

01:09:47.716 --> 01:09:50.786
POST AND HOURS AGO ALONG WITH

01:09:50.853 --> 01:09:52.254
THAT I THINK COULD BE DANGEROUS

01:09:52.321 --> 01:09:53.188
ESPECIALLY MADE UP OF

01:09:53.255 --> 01:09:56.091
INDIVIDUALS A MAJORITY OF WHICH

01:09:56.158 --> 01:09:57.459
MIGHT NOT BE MINE I HAVE A

01:09:57.526 --> 01:10:00.529
BACKGROUND IN CRIMINAL JUSTICE.

01:10:00.596 --> 01:10:02.932
AND I BELIEVE THE LAWYERS AND

01:10:02.998 --> 01:10:05.434
THE DOCTORS THAT WOULD REVIEW-

01:10:05.501 --> 01:10:07.636
CERTIFICATION ISSUES AT THEIR

01:10:07.703 --> 01:10:09.638
LEVEL OUR HAVE THE APPROPRIATE

01:10:09.705 --> 01:10:13.142
BACKGROUND IN. LAW OR MEDICINE.

01:10:13.208 --> 01:10:14.376
BUT THOSE ARE JUST SO MY

01:10:14.443 --> 01:10:16.345
COMMENTS SHARE AND I'LL LEAVE

01:10:16.412 --> 01:10:18.113
IT UP TO THE AUTHOR IF YOU WANT

01:10:18.180 --> 01:10:21.383
TO COMMENT. ON THOSE IN HIS

01:10:21.450 --> 01:10:23.652
CLOSING OR WHENEVER HE SEES FIT.

01:10:23.719 --> 01:10:25.287

LAST YEAR FOR REGROUPING AND

01:10:54.683 --> 01:10:56.585
COMING BACK WITH ANOTHER STRONG-

THE ONLY MEMBER OF THE

01:11:09.264 --> 01:11:11.266
LEGISLATURE AND MIGHT BE WRONG

01:11:11.333 --> 01:11:12.167
BUT I THINK I MIGHT BE THE ONLY

01:11:12.234 --> 01:11:13.702
NUMBER WHO IS ACTUALLY

01:11:13.769 --> 01:11:17.072
LITIGATED- THESE CASES ARE BOTH

01:11:17.139 --> 01:11:19.608
UNDER THE MAIN ACT AND UNDER

QUALIFIED IMMUNITY. AND PEOPLE

01:13:56.365 --> 01:13:59.468
ARE ABLE TO OVERCOME THAT- BUT

01:13:59.535 --> 01:14:03.272
IT IS EXTREMELY EXTREMELY HARD.

01:14:03.338 --> 01:14:06.642
OR YOU CAN GO AND PURSUE A BAN

01:14:06.708 --> 01:14:10.579
ACT- CAUSE OF ACTION WHERE WE

01:14:10.646 --> 01:14:12.581

THAT HAS BEEN INTERPRETED AND

01:14:20.355 --> 01:14:21.690
BUTCHERED BY THE COURTS OVER

01:14:21.757 --> 01:14:25.194
THE YEARS. SO IT'S ALMOST HARD

01:14:25.260 --> 01:14:25.994
TO KNOW HOW YOU'RE EVEN

01:14:26.061 --> 01:14:27.162
SUPPOSED TO SATISFY THE

01:14:27.229 --> 01:14:29.498
ELEMENTS OF IT. BECAUSE IT'S SO

01:14:29.565 --> 01:14:30.999
EXTREME IN TERMS OF THE

01:14:31.066 --> 01:14:31.633
DRAFTING PARTICULARLY THE

01:14:31.700 --> 01:14:33.468
INTERPRETATION AND INTERPRETED

01:14:33.535 --> 01:14:35.470
THE COURT OF APPEALS WHO KNOWS

01:14:35.537 --> 01:14:36.505
NO OFFENSE TO THE COURT OF

01:14:36.572 --> 01:14:38.407
APPEAL BUT IT'S THE CURRICULA

01:14:38.473 --> 01:14:40.309
HOUSING BANGLES THIS SITE YOU

01:14:40.375 --> 01:14:42.578
MORE AND MORE MORE OVER TIME.

01:14:42.644 --> 01:14:43.412
TO THE POINT WHERE IT'S ALMOST

01:14:43.478 --> 01:14:45.781
IMPOSSIBLE TO PLEAD IMPROVE A

01:14:45.848 --> 01:14:47.382
CAUSE OF ACTION FOR VIOLATION

01:14:47.449 --> 01:14:49.017
OF THE BAN ACT PARTICULARLY IN

01:14:49.084 --> 01:14:51.653
THE POLICE. SETTING SO WHAT THE

01:14:51.720 --> 01:14:54.590
BILL DOES. IS IT SAYS FIRST OF

01:14:54.656 --> 01:14:56.291
ALL WHATEVER THE INTENTION OF

01:14:56.358 --> 01:14:58.060
THE LEGISLATURE WAS DECADES AGO

01:14:58.126 --> 01:14:59.895
THERE THE LEAD WITNESS MADE A

01:14:59.962 --> 01:15:01.763
REFERENCE TO IT BEING ABOUT

01:15:01.830 --> 01:15:03.465
HATE CRIMES. THAT'S THAT

01:15:03.532 --> 01:15:05.267
WHATEVER THE INTENTION WAS

01:15:05.334 --> 01:15:06.368
DECADES AGO WHEN THE BAND ACT

01:15:06.435 --> 01:15:08.337
WAS PASSED WE HAVE TO GO WITH

01:15:08.403 --> 01:15:10.038
WHAT OUR CURRENT ATTENTION AS

01:15:10.105 --> 01:15:11.173
AND I BELIEVE OUR INTENTION

01:15:11.240 --> 01:15:13.008
SHOULD BE. FOR CALIFORNIA TO

01:15:13.075 --> 01:15:15.444
HAVE A STRONG AND VIABLE CIVIL

01:15:15.510 --> 01:15:18.814
RIGHTS STATUTE SO THAT. PEOPLE

01:15:18.881 --> 01:15:20.382
WHOSE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS

01:15:20.449 --> 01:15:21.783
HAVE BEEN VIOLATED INCLUDING BY

01:15:21.850 --> 01:15:23.652
POLICE OFFICERS WHEN THEY WERE

01:15:23.719 --> 01:15:25.420
SHOT OR OTHERWISE HARM. HAVE A

01:15:25.487 --> 01:15:27.656
VIABLE CAUSE OF ACTION AND SO

01:15:27.723 --> 01:15:29.157
THE JURY CAN MAKE A DECISION

01:15:29.224 --> 01:15:30.626
WHERE YOUR RIGHTS VIOLATED OVER

01:15:30.692 --> 01:15:32.261
YOUR OR WAS THE POOL OR WAS THE

01:15:32.327 --> 01:15:34.396
OFFICER JUSTIFIED. INSTEAD OF

01:15:34.463 --> 01:15:35.230
HAVING A STRATEGY WHERE YOU

01:15:35.297 --> 01:15:37.232
CAN'T EVEN GET THAT FAR BECAUSE

01:15:37.299 --> 01:15:39.468
OF HOW IT'S BEEN INTERPRETED.

01:15:39.534 --> 01:15:42.738
AND SO S. B. TWO ACTUALLY TO ME

01:15:42.804 --> 01:15:45.107
SOON SMOOTHS IT OUT MAKES A

01:15:45.173 --> 01:15:48.176
COMPREHENSIBLE MAKES IT A-

01:15:48.243 --> 01:15:49.144
STATUE WHERE SOMEONE CAN

01:15:49.211 --> 01:15:51.246
ACTUALLY HAVE A SHOT A PLEADING

01:15:51.313 --> 01:15:52.814
AND PROVING. THIS CAUSE OF

01:15:52.881 --> 01:15:55.851
ACTION- AND THEN I FINALLY WANT

01:15:55.918 --> 01:15:57.920
ONE AS AN BY TALKING ABOUT. THE

01:15:57.986 --> 01:15:59.354
IDEA OF SPECIFIC CONTENT

01:15:59.421 --> 01:16:05.894
BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN THIS.

01:16:05.961 --> 01:16:07.062
FIGHT IN HONESTY TO. OF COURSE

01:16:07.129 --> 01:16:09.498
TO MAKE A- EASE. THAT IS EITHER.

01:16:09.564 --> 01:16:10.432
INTENT TO VIOLATE SOMEONE'S.

01:16:10.499 --> 01:16:12.267
RIGHTS ARE SO BURKE TO THE- AND

01:16:12.334 --> 01:16:14.569
I JUST THINK THAT THAT IS A

01:16:14.636 --> 01:16:17.472
GOOD IDEA- THAT'S NOT WHAT WE

01:16:17.539 --> 01:16:18.941
DO HAVE UNDER FEDERAL AND THE

01:16:19.007 --> 01:16:21.076
FEDERAL CIVIL RIGHTS CHARGES

01:16:21.143 --> 01:16:21.910
UNDER SECTION NINETEEN EIGHTY

01:16:21.977 --> 01:16:24.179
THREE- AND WE SHOULDN'T GO THAT

01:16:24.246 --> 01:16:25.847
ROUTE IN PROGRESSIVE-

01:16:25.914 --> 01:16:28.250
CALIFORNIA. AUG TO PROVE TO

01:16:28.317 --> 01:16:29.651
HAVE TO PROVE THAT A POLICE

01:16:29.718 --> 01:16:33.522
OFFICER- SPECIFICALLY HAD A

01:16:33.588 --> 01:16:35.857
SPECIFIC INTENT. TO VIOLATE

01:16:35.924 --> 01:16:38.360
YOUR CIVIL IT'S- THAT THAT'S I

01:16:38.427 --> 01:16:39.828
MEAN YOU CAN LOOK AT A LOT OF.

01:16:39.895 --> 01:16:41.296
VERY WELL KNOWN CASES

01:16:41.363 --> 01:16:44.066
INCLUDING. THE MURDER OF GEORGE

01:16:44.132 --> 01:16:46.368
FLOYD. AND IT WOULD NOT BE

01:16:46.435 --> 01:16:48.337
IMMEDIATELY APPARENT TO ME.

01:16:48.403 --> 01:16:51.707
THAT SOMEONE COULD APPROVE IT

01:16:51.773 --> 01:16:53.175
AND CIVIL COURT. YES IN

01:16:53.241 --> 01:16:54.710
SPECIFIC CONTENT BECAUSE IT IS

01:16:54.776 --> 01:16:57.412
SUCH A HIGH STANDARD. AND IT IS

01:16:57.479 --> 01:16:59.548
SO EASY AS A DEFENDANT. TO

01:16:59.614 --> 01:17:01.984
ARGUE THAT THE WORLD EVEN IF

01:17:02.050 --> 01:17:03.618
YOU THINK I MESSED UP EVEN IF

01:17:03.685 --> 01:17:05.187
YOU THINK I WAS YEAH MAYBE

01:17:05.253 --> 01:17:07.322
RECKLESS I DID NOT HAVE THE

01:17:07.389 --> 01:17:09.758
SPECIFIC CONTENT I DID NOT

01:17:09.825 --> 01:17:10.359
INTEND TO VIOLATE YOUR CIVIL

01:17:10.425 --> 01:17:14.363
RIGHTS- THAT THAT'S TO ME THAT

01:17:14.429 --> 01:17:16.531
THAT IS NOT A GOOD PATH. FOR US

01:17:16.598 --> 01:17:18.066
AND CITING THE WAY THAT THE

01:17:18.133 --> 01:17:20.702
STATUES DRAFTED NOW IS A MUCH

01:17:20.769 --> 01:17:22.904
MUCH BETTER APPROACH AND AGAIN

01:17:22.971 --> 01:17:25.073
THIS IS ABOUT IMIA AND- WHETHER

01:17:25.140 --> 01:17:27.242
A JURY IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO

01:17:27.309 --> 01:17:29.044
MAKE THAT DECISION. DID YOU

01:17:29.111 --> 01:17:30.946
VIOLATE A PERSON'S RIGHTS THEY

01:17:31.013 --> 01:17:32.147
DO NOT VIOLATE THE PERSON'S

01:17:32.214 --> 01:17:34.182
RIGHTS NOW WE KNOW THE INJURIES

01:17:34.249 --> 01:17:36.385
GO BOTH WAYS ON THESE ISSUES IS

01:17:36.451 --> 01:17:38.320
NOT A FOREGONE CONCLUSION BUT

01:17:38.387 --> 01:17:38.920
PEOPLE SHOULD AT LEAST HAVE A

01:17:38.987 --> 01:17:40.689

ENGAGED IN HORRIBLE RECKLESS

01:20:45.740 --> 01:20:47.108
BEHAVIOR THAT THE JURY FOUND

HIM GUILTY OF. AND SO THE

01:20:50.111 --> 01:20:52.681
QUESTION BECOMES UNDER VEINS

01:20:52.747 --> 01:20:53.949
FOR THOSE WHO TRY THESE CASES

TITLE SIX TOTAL OF FORTY TO

01:20:58.053 --> 01:21:00.522
NINETEEN FORTY THREE CASES. AND

01:21:00.589 --> 01:21:01.656
THAT WAY BACK IN THE WAY BACK

01:21:01.723 --> 01:21:06.394
MACHINE. IS THAT. THE PROBLEM

01:21:06.461 --> 01:21:07.896
YOU REALLY FACE IN THIS SPACE

01:21:07.963 --> 01:21:09.764
AND THE REAL ESSENCE TO ME OF

01:21:09.831 --> 01:21:11.633
WHAT I HAVE CHALLENGES WITH

01:21:11.700 --> 01:21:14.569
THIS BILL ARE. IS THAT THE

01:21:14.636 --> 01:21:16.137
FEDERAL COURT ALLOWS YOU TO GET

01:21:16.204 --> 01:21:18.873
THE WRONGFUL DEATH. BUT NOBODY

01:21:18.940 --> 01:21:21.009
IN THE IN THE LOWER THE BARS

01:21:21.076 --> 01:21:23.178
STATE CITY TYLER COMMITTEE

01:21:23.245 --> 01:21:24.613
LIKES GOING TO THE FEDERAL

01:21:24.679 --> 01:21:25.714
COURT BECAUSE JUDGES PICK THE

01:21:25.780 --> 01:21:27.549
JURORS AND YOU HAVE A MUCH

01:21:27.616 --> 01:21:29.684
BETTER CHANCE IN STATE COURT.

01:21:29.751 --> 01:21:30.819
SO WHAT THIS BILL DOES IN A

01:21:30.885 --> 01:21:33.955
VERY SIGNIFICANT WAY IS IT IS

01:21:34.022 --> 01:21:35.190
IT'S NOT JUST THE STANDARD BY

01:21:35.257 --> 01:21:37.459
WHICH- WE LOOK AT PROTECTING

01:21:37.525 --> 01:21:39.461
CIVIL RIGHTS IT'S THE REMEDY.

01:21:39.527 --> 01:21:41.263
AND THE REMEDY IS THAT IF

01:21:41.329 --> 01:21:42.664
SOMEONE GETS HURT IT'S ONE

01:21:42.731 --> 01:21:44.299
THING BUT IF THEY DIDN'T GET A

01:21:44.366 --> 01:21:46.301
REMEDY IF THEY DIE AND THIS

01:21:46.368 --> 01:21:48.203
FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGES THE

01:21:48.270 --> 01:21:52.207
PROCESS. OF HOW. THE BRAIN ACT

01:21:52.274 --> 01:21:54.042
WORKS BECAUSE IT APPLIES TO

01:21:54.109 --> 01:21:55.210
WRONGFUL DEATH AND IF YOU TALK

01:21:55.277 --> 01:21:57.245
TO ANY PRACTICING LAWYER IN THE

01:21:57.312 --> 01:21:58.446
SPACE OF WHICH I HAVE TALKED

01:21:58.513 --> 01:22:00.649
AND SPOKE TO A NUMBER IT WITH

01:22:00.715 --> 01:22:02.150
RESPECT TO PREPARATION FOR

01:22:02.217 --> 01:22:03.818
TODAY IN ANTICIPATION IN

01:22:03.885 --> 01:22:05.420
DISCUSSIONS WITH THE AUTHOR. ON

01:22:05.487 --> 01:22:07.622
THIS THEY WILL TELL YOU. THAT

01:22:07.689 --> 01:22:09.157
HAVING A WRONGFUL DEATH CLAIM

01:22:09.224 --> 01:22:10.191
IN THE STATE COURT IS A

01:22:10.258 --> 01:22:12.193
GIGANTICALLY APPROPRIATE

01:22:12.260 --> 01:22:16.464
ADVANTAGE. SO THAT BEING SAID

01:22:16.531 --> 01:22:17.098
THEN YOU LOOK TO THE STANDARD.

01:22:17.165 --> 01:22:19.234
THE STANDARD HAS BEEN AS WAS

01:22:19.301 --> 01:22:21.269

CASE MAY BE. IT HAS IN MY

01:22:50.899 --> 01:22:53.101
JUDGMENT CONFUSING LANGUAGE AT

01:22:53.168 --> 01:22:55.036
THE ONE HAND IT SAYS FOR

01:22:55.103 --> 01:22:56.271

INTENT. A COUPLE OF LINES ABOVE

01:23:02.444 --> 01:23:03.478
IT TALKS ABOUT DELIBERATE

01:23:03.545 --> 01:23:04.946
INDIFFERENCE OR RECKLESS

01:23:05.013 --> 01:23:08.483

A LOT OF VERY BRIGHT FOLKS. ON

01:23:14.356 --> 01:23:17.158
ALL SIDES- I THINK THAT THAT

01:23:17.225 --> 01:23:19.527
THE UNDERLYING ISSUE HERE I

01:23:19.594 --> 01:23:20.428
DON'T THINK ANYBODY OBJECTS

01:23:20.495 --> 01:23:22.997
THAT WE AT LEAST ANYBODY I'VE

01:23:23.064 --> 01:23:23.598

LEGISLATURE TO A NEW STANDARD

WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON IN A

01:23:30.805 --> 01:23:33.641
HORRIBLY INAPPROPRIATE WAY. AND

01:23:33.708 --> 01:23:34.743

GOING TO DRAMATICALLY CHANGE

01:23:40.982 --> 01:23:42.917
THE REMEDY. BUT NOT LOOK AT THE

01:23:42.984 --> 01:23:43.952
STANDARD ESPECIALLY WHEN THE

01:23:44.018 --> 01:23:45.353

01:23:51.059 --> 01:23:52.660
OF AMENDMENTS- WITH THERE'S

01:23:52.727 --> 01:23:54.095
BEEN DISCUSSIONS OF AMENDMENTS

01:23:54.162 --> 01:23:55.063
DEALING WITH THE IDEA OF

01:23:55.130 --> 01:23:57.632
RECKLESS AND- WHICH I WHICH I

THOUGHT YOU WERE PULLING OUT A

01:24:07.409 --> 01:24:10.111
TASER HE PULLED A GUN.

01:24:10.178 --> 01:24:10.879
SIGNIFICANT SET OF FACTS THAT

01:24:10.945 --> 01:24:14.082
ARE DIFFERENT. ON AN EDIT

01:24:14.149 --> 01:24:15.650

MARKED UP AND THAT MAYBE WE

01:24:27.896 --> 01:24:29.364

TITLE FORTY TWO NINETEEN EIGHTY

01:24:30.865 --> 01:24:32.333
THREE. BUT THAT'S THE THAT AND

01:24:32.400 --> 01:24:33.401
APPLY THOSE STANDARDS BECAUSE

01:24:33.468 --> 01:24:35.069
THEY HAVE A BETTER BODY OF CASE

01:24:35.136 --> 01:24:36.638
SUPPORTING ONE OF THE THINGS

01:24:36.704 --> 01:24:37.272

ABROGATING THE CASE BUT IT

01:24:56.391 --> 01:24:58.359

01:25:32.360 --> 01:25:34.462
SIGNIFICANT. THERE'S NO ISSUES

01:25:34.529 --> 01:25:36.064
ABOUT TRANSPARENCY ALL THE

01:25:36.130 --> 01:25:37.398
OTHER ISSUES THAT RELATE TO LAW

01:25:37.465 --> 01:25:39.033
ENFORCEMENT WHICH THERE ARE

01:25:39.100 --> 01:25:39.567
PUBLISHED BY THIS WHICH I

01:25:39.634 --> 01:25:41.636
COMPLETELY AGREE WITH. BUT HOW

01:25:41.703 --> 01:25:43.471
DO WE GET TO THAT POINT SO THE

01:25:43.538 --> 01:25:45.740
BOTTOM LINE IS THAT THE ONE OF

01:25:45.807 --> 01:25:47.942
THE SUGGESTIONS THAT I HAD IS

01:25:48.009 --> 01:25:48.643
MADE WE JUST PUT THIS BILL

01:25:48.710 --> 01:25:51.179
OVER. AND THEN WE TAKE THE TIME

01:25:51.246 --> 01:25:54.282
TO. TO CONTINUE THIS AND IF WE

01:25:54.349 --> 01:25:55.783
HAVE TO SET A SPECIAL HEARING

01:25:55.850 --> 01:25:57.352
GIVEN THE CHALLENGES MAYBE

01:25:57.418 --> 01:25:58.753
THAT'S THE SOLUTION THAT WASN'T

01:25:58.820 --> 01:26:00.188
REALLY. SUGGESTS IT WAS IT WAS

01:26:00.255 --> 01:26:02.290
A PEOPLE ARE EXCITED ABOUT THAT

01:26:02.357 --> 01:26:03.825
BUT I DO THINK THAT IN THIS

01:26:03.892 --> 01:26:04.759
COMMITTEE THE JUDICIARY

01:26:04.826 --> 01:26:06.561

STRONG TO THIS COMMITTEE- A- MY

01:29:10.044 --> 01:29:16.818
I GUESS MY QUESTIONS ARE. ABOUT

THIS SPECIFIC- THE DEBATE WE'RE

01:29:20.655 --> 01:29:22.690
HAVING I GUESS RIGHT NOW I'M

01:29:22.757 --> 01:29:25.059
READING UP IN THE ANALYSIS OF

01:29:25.126 --> 01:29:27.061
THIS DEBATE ABOUT SPECIFIC

01:29:27.128 --> 01:29:29.597
VERSES GENERAL INTENDS. AND I'M

01:29:29.664 --> 01:29:31.132
HOPING TO GET SOME CLARITY AND

01:29:31.199 --> 01:29:33.000
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER IT'S FROM-

01:29:33.067 --> 01:29:35.103
THE EXPERT WITNESS- THE

01:29:35.169 --> 01:29:37.739
ATTORNEY OR THE AUTHOR OR MAYBE

01:29:37.805 --> 01:29:39.107
IN THE CLOTHES OR WHATEVER IS

01:29:39.173 --> 01:29:41.709
APPROPRIATE BUT- ADAM WHAT WHAT

01:29:41.776 --> 01:29:45.179
SPECIFICALLY. DIDN'T WORK ABOUT

01:29:45.246 --> 01:29:46.914
THE VARIOUS STANDARDS THAT HAVE

01:29:46.981 --> 01:29:48.816
BEEN DISCUSSED BACK AND FORTH

01:29:48.883 --> 01:29:50.384
IT SEEMS LIKE THERE'S A LOT OF

01:29:50.451 --> 01:29:52.754
VARIATIONS BETWEEN FULL GENERAL

01:29:52.820 --> 01:29:56.057
INTENDS AND WHAT WHAT FOLKS ARE

01:29:56.124 --> 01:29:56.891
CALLING SPECIFIC INTENT WHICH

01:29:56.958 --> 01:29:58.459
IS YOU KNOW COULD BE

01:29:58.526 --> 01:29:59.927
CHARACTERIZED AS AN OFFICER

01:29:59.994 --> 01:30:01.195
DELIBERATELY INTENDING TO

01:30:01.262 --> 01:30:02.396
VIOLATE SOMEBODY CIVIL RIGHTS

01:30:02.463 --> 01:30:03.798
OR COULD BE RECKLESS

01:30:03.865 --> 01:30:05.500
INDIFFERENCE TO THOSE RIGHTS OR

01:30:05.566 --> 01:30:08.236
COULD JUST BE SIMPLY. IGNORING

01:30:08.302 --> 01:30:10.238
YOU KNOW KNOWING CIRCUMSTANCES

01:30:10.304 --> 01:30:13.674
ARE- MAKING IT SAY- ARREST-

01:30:13.741 --> 01:30:16.110
THAT WAS THE WRONG SUSPECT- BUT

01:30:16.177 --> 01:30:17.745
USING SOMETHING LIKE RACES THE

01:30:17.812 --> 01:30:19.180
QUALIFIER WHICH WE KNOW MANY

01:30:19.247 --> 01:30:21.849
PEOPLE TO GO THROUGH- THOSE

01:30:21.916 --> 01:30:26.521
KINDS OF STOPS ARRESTS SEARCHES.

01:30:26.587 --> 01:30:28.790
THE QUESTION TO ME IS IT JUST

01:30:28.856 --> 01:30:30.324
JUST TO GET INTO SPECIFICS A

01:30:30.391 --> 01:30:32.126
LITTLE BIT HERE AND TRY TO

01:30:32.193 --> 01:30:32.960
UNDERSTAND A LITTLE BETTER.

01:30:33.027 --> 01:30:36.164
WHAT IT HOW EXACTLY WOULD. WHAT

01:30:36.230 --> 01:30:37.431
WHAT KIND OF CONDUCT WOULD

01:30:37.498 --> 01:30:38.299
ACTUALLY MEET THE STANDARD IN

01:30:38.366 --> 01:30:40.134
THIS BILL BECAUSE I'M I'M STILL

01:30:47.542 --> 01:30:49.210
THERE ANY AND WHETHER THERE'S A

01:30:49.277 --> 01:30:51.445
CONCERN ABOUT THE EVIDENTIARY

01:30:51.512 --> 01:30:52.980

01:30:57.652 --> 01:30:59.821
DELIBERATE INDIFFERENCE OR

RECKLESS DISREGARD. IF IT'S

01:31:01.422 --> 01:31:03.357
REALLY BAD EVIDENCE- AND

01:31:03.424 --> 01:31:04.792
CONCERNED ABOUT NOT HAVING

TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES THAT I

THOUGH THEY FOUND THAT ACTION

01:33:03.844 --> 01:33:05.780
TO BE A JURY WOULD RECENTLY

01:33:05.846 --> 01:33:07.348
FIND THAT THAT KIND OF

01:40:37.364 --> 01:40:37.831
HAVE BEEN REAL APPROPRIATE

01:40:37.898 --> 01:40:42.069
RIGHT AFTER- SENATOR- FROM LA.

01:40:42.136 --> 01:40:44.037
I WANTED TO BASICALLY SAY THAT

01:40:44.104 --> 01:40:45.372
I DON'T HAVE ANY PROBLEM WITH

01:40:45.439 --> 01:40:46.907
THE WHOLE ISSUE OF IMMUNITY OR

01:40:46.974 --> 01:40:49.209
THE ISSUE OF DECERTIFICATION-

01:40:49.276 --> 01:40:50.744
AND ALL THE LICENSING I THINK

01:40:50.811 --> 01:40:52.413
NEEDS WORK A LOT OF WORK THIS

01:40:52.479 --> 01:40:53.580
COMMITTEE DOESN'T HAVE

01:40:53.647 --> 01:40:55.549
JURISDICTION OVER THE LICENSING

01:40:55.616 --> 01:41:00.287
BUT- BUT IN REGARDS TO. THE-

01:41:00.354 --> 01:41:02.122
THE LIABILITY ISSUES I HAVE

01:41:02.189 --> 01:41:03.724
SOME CONCERN AND I WANTED TO

BASICALLY SAY THAT I THINK WE

01:41:05.092 --> 01:41:07.628
NEED TO TAKE THE TIME- I THINK

01:41:07.694 --> 01:41:09.196
SENATOR BRADFORD HAS DONE A

01:41:09.263 --> 01:41:11.632
TREMENDOUS JOB- IN BRINGING

01:41:11.698 --> 01:41:12.699
THIS BILL FORWARD BUT I THINK

01:41:12.766 --> 01:41:14.435
IT NEEDS SOME WORK AND IT'S

01:41:14.501 --> 01:41:16.470
RARE. BUT JUST SAY IT IT'S VERY

01:41:16.537 --> 01:41:19.339
RARE. TO INTRODUCE A BILL AND

01:41:19.406 --> 01:41:21.175
NOT HAVE ANY AMENDMENTS AT ALL.

01:41:21.241 --> 01:41:23.977
THE CLARIFY AND TO- MAKE SURE

01:41:24.044 --> 01:41:25.446
THAT WE'RE PICKING THE RIGHT

01:41:25.512 --> 01:41:26.713
STANDARDS AND THAT IT MAKES

01:41:26.780 --> 01:41:28.415
SENSE AND THAT THERE'S NO

01:41:28.482 --> 01:41:31.051
CONFUSION BASED ON ON THE

01:41:31.118 --> 01:41:33.253
LANGUAGE THAT WE'VE USED AND- I

01:41:33.320 --> 01:41:33.921
HAVE SOME REAL ISSUES WITH SOME

01:41:33.987 --> 01:41:35.289
OF THE LANGUAGE WILL GO INTO

01:41:35.355 --> 01:41:37.124
THEM HERE I THINK. YOU KNOW WE

01:41:37.191 --> 01:41:38.859
CAN TALK ABOUT THIS ALL DAY BUT

01:41:38.926 --> 01:41:40.194
I JUST THINK WE SHOULD TAKE THE

01:41:40.260 --> 01:41:41.228
TIME AND I THINK IT'S

01:41:41.295 --> 01:41:43.497
LEADERSHIP. AND LEADERSHIP IS

01:41:43.564 --> 01:41:45.532
INVOLVED IN THIS BILL WE CAN

01:41:45.599 --> 01:41:48.068
WAIVE THE RULES. THAT ARE IN

01:41:48.135 --> 01:41:50.103
PLACE AND THERE'S NOTHING THAT

01:41:50.170 --> 01:41:51.638
JUST DRIVING US TO DO

01:41:51.705 --> 01:41:53.807
SOMETHING. TO PASS SOMETHING

01:41:53.874 --> 01:41:55.108
RIGHT NOW THAT ISN'T IN THE

01:41:55.175 --> 01:41:57.177

REQUEST THAT WE CONSIDER TAKING

01:42:01.048 --> 01:42:02.149
THE TIME WE NEED TO GET THIS

01:42:02.216 --> 01:42:03.984
RIGHT. I GUESS ON THE COPIER I

IT IS SOMEWHAT EMBARRASSING.

01:42:41.455 --> 01:42:43.924
THAT SOMEONE DOESN'T HAVE

01:42:43.991 --> 01:42:45.993
RECOURSE IN A WRONGFUL DEATH

01:42:46.059 --> 01:42:48.161

WAS RAISED BY SEVERAL FOLKS.

01:43:07.948 --> 01:43:12.352
THAT WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION HERE

01:43:12.419 --> 01:43:14.888

LAW IS APPLIED THAT IT'S CLEAR

01:43:20.294 --> 01:43:21.628
I ASSOCIATE MYSELF WITH THE

01:43:21.695 --> 01:43:23.030
COMMENTS OF SENATOR WIENER FROM

01:43:23.096 --> 01:43:25.198
SAN FRANCISCO. THE MAIN ACT IS

01:43:25.265 --> 01:43:27.334
A HOT MESS I LOOKED AT THE JURY

01:43:27.401 --> 01:43:28.869
INSTRUCTION YOU PROBABLY FILE

01:43:28.936 --> 01:43:30.437

THE MEN'S RAY OF THE SPECIFIC

01:43:47.754 --> 01:43:49.656
CONTENT VERSUS GENERAL INTENT

01:43:49.723 --> 01:43:50.691
VERSUS THE LEVELS OF

01:43:50.757 --> 01:43:53.160
CULPABILITY DOES NEED TO BE

01:43:53.226 --> 01:43:55.696
DEFINED WE NEEDED TO FIND. NOT

01:43:55.762 --> 01:43:58.065
I NOR I THINK ANYBODY ELSE

WANTS TO SEE A SPECIFIC INTENT

01:43:59.933 --> 01:44:01.969
STANDARD THAT EXIST TODAY. WE

01:44:02.035 --> 01:44:03.236
DON'T WANT TO SEE A STANDARD

01:44:03.303 --> 01:44:05.606
WHERE SOMEONE HASTO PROVE THE

SHE DIES. THAT'S AT LEAST

01:44:17.417 --> 01:44:18.385
RECKLESS CONDUCT I THINK IT'S

01:44:18.452 --> 01:44:19.620
INTENTIONAL CONDUCT BUT IT'S AT

01:44:19.686 --> 01:44:21.555
LEAST RECKLESS CONDUCT AND

01:44:21.622 --> 01:44:24.658

01:45:49.076 --> 01:45:52.179
MANY. IN THIS PROFESSION WHO

01:45:52.245 --> 01:45:55.849
BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A FAIR.

01:45:55.916 --> 01:45:58.885

A YEAR TO WORK ON THIS MEASURE.

01:46:16.136 --> 01:46:17.971

01:46:38.191 --> 01:46:39.726
RECKLESSNESS TO INTENTIONAL

MANY MORE PEOPLE REGARDLESS OF

01:46:43.530 --> 01:46:45.799
COLOR NEED TO LOSE THEIR LIVES

01:46:45.866 --> 01:46:48.401

FROM FRESNO WHO ASKED THE

01:46:51.872 --> 01:46:53.073
QUESTION ABOUT THE ADVISORY

01:46:53.140 --> 01:46:54.875
BOARD DEVICE REPORT IS JUST

01:46:54.941 --> 01:46:56.610
THAT AN ADVISORY BOARD IT HAS

01:46:56.676 --> 01:46:58.145

THAT POLLS CAN TRULY OVERALL

01:47:05.619 --> 01:47:07.354
IT'S AN ADVISORY BOARD. BUT IT

01:47:07.420 --> 01:47:08.455
RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT THE

01:47:08.522 --> 01:47:09.556
COMPOSITION OF THE

01:47:09.623 --> 01:47:10.257
QUALIFICATIONS OF THESE

01:47:10.323 --> 01:47:12.626
INDIVIDUALS. IT'S MEMBERS IN

01:47:17.631 --> 01:47:18.932
ABOUT HOW IT WORKS IN REAL

01:47:18.999 --> 01:47:20.734

01:47:29.309 --> 01:47:31.778
IN A BOX. TO DETERMINE ONE'S

01:47:31.845 --> 01:47:33.814
LIFE OR DEATH SITUATION EVERY

01:47:33.880 --> 01:47:35.882
DAY IN A JURY TRIAL NOBODY

01:47:35.949 --> 01:47:36.883
ASKED ABOUT THEIR

01:47:36.950 --> 01:47:38.819
QUALIFICATIONS SO TO SAY THAT.

01:47:38.885 --> 01:47:40.587
ONLY LAW ENFORCEMENT CAN POLICE

01:47:40.654 --> 01:47:42.989
THE POLICE THAT IS WHAT LED US

01:47:43.056 --> 01:47:44.658
HERE TODAY AND THAT'S WHY WE'VE

01:47:44.724 --> 01:47:45.792
GOT AHUNDRED AND TWENTY YEARS

01:47:45.859 --> 01:47:48.061

01:47:48.128 --> 01:47:49.496
GUY WANTS IT WE KEEP DOING WHAT

01:47:49.563 --> 01:47:51.832
WE DO WHEN WE GOT BIG KEEP

GETTING WHAT WE GET. AND THAT'S

01:47:52.532 --> 01:47:55.902
NOTHING. THIS IS GOOD POLICY.

01:47:55.969 --> 01:47:58.071
AND IT'S TIME FOR CALIFORNIA

01:47:58.138 --> 01:48:00.774
IT'S TIME FOR US AS LEGISLATORS

01:48:00.841 --> 01:48:01.408

UNDERSTAND THEIR TO. SYSTEMS OF

01:48:11.885 --> 01:48:15.989
JUSTICE IN THIS COUNTRY. IT'S

01:48:16.056 --> 01:48:17.524
TWO SYSTEMS BUT YOU'LL NEVER

ANYTHING ANY OF YOU GUYS HAVE

01:48:26.099 --> 01:48:26.533

ENCOUNTER. AND ALL WE'RE ASKING

01:48:29.970 --> 01:48:32.239
FOR IS A OPPORTUNITY TO NOT

01:48:32.305 --> 01:48:34.674
ONLY SAVE LIVES BUT FOR THOSE

01:48:34.741 --> 01:48:36.710

SENSE OF FAIRNESS. THIS IS NOT

01:48:41.314 --> 01:48:43.683
A PERFECT BILL. BUT WE WOULD

01:48:43.750 --> 01:48:44.951
ALL AGREE THERE'S NO SUCH

01:48:45.018 --> 01:48:47.888
PERFECT BILL. BUT IT'S BETTER

01:48:47.954 --> 01:48:49.089
THAN WHAT WE HAVE AND IT SURELY

01:48:49.155 --> 01:48:52.559
BEAT NOTHING. IT IS BEEN WELL

01:48:52.626 --> 01:48:55.262
THE BRAIDED. BUT WE SHOULDN'T

01:48:55.328 --> 01:48:58.231

01:48:58.298 --> 01:48:59.833
PERFECT BE THE ENEMY OF THE

01:48:59.900 --> 01:49:04.971
GOOD. WE SHOULD WE SHOULD TAKE

01:49:05.038 --> 01:49:07.207
BOLD AND DECISIVE ACTIONS WE

01:49:07.274 --> 01:49:09.276
SHOULD TAKE FAIR ACTIONS AND

01:49:09.342 --> 01:49:11.011

AGENCIES THAT SUPPORTED TODAY

01:49:18.251 --> 01:49:20.053
BEEN SUPPORTED LAST YEAR SO

01:49:20.120 --> 01:49:22.155
WHAT A DIFFERENCE A YEAR MAKES.

01:49:22.222 --> 01:49:24.057
WHAT A DIFFERENCE A YEAR MAKES

01:49:24.124 --> 01:49:26.426
THOSE SAME AGENCIES WORK

01:49:26.493 --> 01:49:28.261
ADAMANTLY OPPOSED WHEN IT

01:49:28.328 --> 01:49:30.297
SIMPLY WAS A DE SER BILL BUT

PROTECTING PEOPLE'S CIVIL

01:49:37.270 --> 01:49:39.372
RIGHTS AS WELL. WE SHOULD

01:49:39.439 --> 01:49:44.077
AFFORD THEM TO FIND JUSTICE NOT.

SPECIFIC BILL. WELL THE IF THIS

02:37:41.318 --> 02:37:42.786
TURNS TO BE A BUSINESS MODEL

02:38:13.350 --> 02:38:14.484
TENDS TO GROUP TOGETHER

02:38:14.551 --> 02:38:16.587
BECAUSE- OF A- BECAUSE AGAIN

APPLIANCES- THIS BILL TAKES A

02:38:23.760 --> 02:38:24.962
SIMPLE APPROACH LOOKING AT JUST

COLLEAGUES ARE AND I USE THE

03:12:27.235 --> 03:12:28.570
EXAMPLE OF SOMETHING THAT WAS

03:12:28.637 --> 03:12:31.773

WERE WORKING THROUGH AN

03:12:46.554 --> 03:12:47.856
AUTHORIZED DEALER. AND I THINK

03:12:47.923 --> 03:12:50.425
IT'S- IT'S A ONE SIDED IT COULD

03:12:50.492 --> 03:12:52.093
BE HELPFUL TO HAVE AS MANY

03:12:52.160 --> 03:12:54.996
INDIVIDUALS. TRAINED IN HOW TO

REPAIR- THESE THESE DEVICES AS

03:12:58.266 --> 03:12:59.968
POSSIBLE BECAUSE IT FACILITATES

03:13:00.035 --> 03:13:01.469
CIRCULATION THE PRODUCT

03:13:01.536 --> 03:13:04.139
CIRCULATES. THE THE TECHNOLOGY

03:13:04.205 --> 03:13:06.675
BASE AND THOSE LEARNING AND HOW

03:13:06.741 --> 03:13:09.577
TO BE A PART OF IT. ON THE FLIP

03:13:09.644 --> 03:13:11.413
SIDE IS. EVEN THOUGH THESE ARE

03:13:11.479 --> 03:13:13.381
PUBLICLY OF LARGELY PUBLICLY

03:13:13.448 --> 03:13:15.951
AVAILABLE MATERIALS THERE IS

03:13:16.017 --> 03:13:17.519
SOME CONCERN ABOUT INTELLECTUAL

03:13:17.585 --> 03:13:20.655
PROPERTY LOSS. AND I DIDN'T

03:13:20.722 --> 03:13:21.156

03:13:24.626 --> 03:13:27.228
SIMPLY CREATE AN AUTHORIZED

REPAIR ENTITY THAT WOULD BE

03:13:29.464 --> 03:13:31.199

03:13:37.305 --> 03:13:39.207
INTELLECTUALLY PROTECTIONS IS

03:13:39.274 --> 03:13:42.477
THAT SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN

03:13:42.544 --> 03:13:45.013
DISCUSSED AT SOME LENGTH- I

03:13:45.080 --> 03:13:46.648
BELIEVE WHEN THEY DID THE LAST

03:13:46.715 --> 03:13:47.649
STUDY THAT'S WHAT THEY

03:13:47.716 --> 03:13:49.117
SUGGESTED TO THE MANUFACTURERS

03:13:49.184 --> 03:13:50.418
THAT THEY PUT IN SOME KIND OF

03:13:50.485 --> 03:13:52.087
PASSWORD CODE AND TO BE ABLE TO

03:13:52.153 --> 03:13:52.887
GET THROUGH SO THEY COULD

03:13:52.954 --> 03:13:54.889
MAINTAIN WHAT THEY NEEDED TO

03:13:54.956 --> 03:13:55.957
FOR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTIES.

03:13:56.024 --> 03:13:57.459

IN AS WELL. YEAH THIS IS KEVIN

03:14:06.134 --> 03:14:08.003
O'REILLY WOULD GET. AFTER THAT

03:14:08.069 --> 03:14:08.837
THE ONE THING THAT I MENTION

03:14:08.903 --> 03:14:12.374
ABOUT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IS-

03:14:12.440 --> 03:14:14.175
WE SUBMITTED A LETTER ON THE

FROM THE COMMITTEES- FROM THE

03:30:04.992 --> 03:30:06.360
CONSULTANTS AND I WAS HOPING

03:30:06.427 --> 03:30:07.328
THAT I WOULD. HAVE A LITTLE

03:30:07.394 --> 03:30:09.730
MORE- WHEN I FOUND OUT A COUPLE

03:30:09.797 --> 03:30:11.865
YEARS BACK- THAT OUR EMPLOYEES

03:30:11.932 --> 03:30:13.167
DIDN'T GET THE SAME THINGS I

GIVE TO MY OWN EMPLOYEES. I WAS

03:30:15.369 --> 03:30:17.271
APPALLED QUITE FRANKLY BECAUSE

03:30:17.338 --> 03:30:18.572
WE DO WORK LONG HOURS HERE AND

03:30:18.639 --> 03:30:20.607
I THINK THAT AND WE ALSO HEAR.

03:30:20.674 --> 03:30:21.709
A LOT OF SPEECHES ON THE FLOOR

03:30:21.775 --> 03:30:24.445
ABOUT HOW WE'RE PRO THE WORKING

03:30:24.511 --> 03:30:26.580
PERSON WHICH BIG SEVERAL LAWS

03:30:26.647 --> 03:30:28.749
AND I AND SO. I ALSO. KNOW HOW

03:30:28.816 --> 03:30:30.784
BURDENS IT IS TO DO THE LAWS

03:30:30.851 --> 03:30:31.552
THAT ARE PASSED IN THE

03:30:31.618 --> 03:30:33.687
LEGISLATURE. SO TO ANSWER YOUR

03:30:33.754 --> 03:30:36.123
QUESTION. I REALLY HAVEN'T HAD

03:30:36.190 --> 03:30:38.258
A LOT OF FOLKS WORKING WITH ME

03:30:38.325 --> 03:30:39.159
ON THIS BILL I'VE BEEN KIND OF

03:30:39.226 --> 03:30:41.362
ON MY OWN. BECAUSE I THINK THEY

03:30:41.428 --> 03:30:42.596
THOUGHT IT WAS LIKE A STATEMENT

03:30:42.663 --> 03:30:43.797
OR SOMETHING BUT I AM VERY

03:30:43.864 --> 03:30:44.999
SERIOUS ABOUT THIS BILL I THINK

03:30:45.065 --> 03:30:46.500
IT IS. THE RIGHTEOUS THING TO

03:30:46.567 --> 03:30:48.335
DO FOR THOSE LOW DEFINITELY I

03:30:48.402 --> 03:30:50.070
LEARNED IN THIS JUST FROM THE

03:30:50.137 --> 03:30:52.172
LAST COMMITTEE ABOUT. THE

03:30:52.239 --> 03:30:54.141
DOUBLE THE TO THE BILL WHICH

03:30:54.208 --> 03:30:54.975
YOU ACTUALLY ASK ME THAT

03:30:55.042 --> 03:30:56.643
QUESTION AND I DID NOT KNOW THE

03:30:56.710 --> 03:30:58.812
ANSWER I FOUND THAT ANSWER OUT-

03:30:58.879 --> 03:31:00.814
SINCE THEN SO IT'S DOUBLE THE

03:31:00.881 --> 03:31:03.384
WEIGHT I DID NOT. I'M NOT GOING

03:31:03.450 --> 03:31:04.785
AFTER COLLECTIVE BARGAINING I'M

03:31:04.852 --> 03:31:06.320
I KNOW THAT. MOST PUBLIC

03:31:06.387 --> 03:31:08.622
AGENCIES HAVE THAT. SO IN THIS

03:31:08.689 --> 03:31:09.590
BILL I JUST QUITE FRANKLY

03:31:09.656 --> 03:31:11.191
REALLY. IT REALLY MAINLY

03:31:11.258 --> 03:31:14.928
FOCUSED ON THE- THE- THE PROP

03:31:14.995 --> 03:31:16.130
SIXTY FIVE I MEAN. I BROUGHT IT

03:31:16.196 --> 03:31:18.165
UP A COUPLE YEARS AGO THE

03:31:18.232 --> 03:31:19.433
BOTTLES THAT ARE ON OUR DESK

03:31:19.500 --> 03:31:21.335
AND HAVE. THE HAND SANITIZER

03:31:21.402 --> 03:31:23.470
ADAM WAS AN EXAMPLE I USE THAT

03:31:23.537 --> 03:31:24.905
IN MY BUSINESS I WOULD HAVE TO

03:31:24.972 --> 03:31:26.640
LABEL THAT SO THAT THE-

03:31:26.707 --> 03:31:28.776
EMPLOYER. EMPLOYEES WOULD KNOW.

03:31:28.842 --> 03:31:29.877
WHAT'S IN THAT BOTTLE NOW WE

03:31:29.943 --> 03:31:31.812
ALL KNOW WHAT'S HAND SANITIZER.

03:31:31.879 --> 03:31:33.647
BUT TO THE LETTER OF THE LAW

03:31:33.714 --> 03:31:35.349
WHICH MY WITNESS TALKED ABOUT.

03:31:35.416 --> 03:31:36.817

03:34:21.782 --> 03:34:24.418
MY CONCERN IS TO PUT. THE TO

03:34:24.484 --> 03:34:27.054
MAKE. TO JUST COMPOUND THE

03:34:27.120 --> 03:34:29.590
PROBLEM BY BY BY HAVING THE

03:34:29.656 --> 03:34:33.193
LEGISLATURE- DO ABIDE BY THE

03:34:33.260 --> 03:34:34.995
SAME RULES I GET YOUR POINT-

03:34:35.062 --> 03:34:36.597
SOME OF THE SUPPORT SUPPORTED

03:34:36.663 --> 03:34:40.601
TODAY BUT- BUT IT IS- IRONIC

03:34:40.667 --> 03:34:41.668
THAT THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT

03:34:41.735 --> 03:34:43.604
WE- THAT WE DID WELL WE

03:34:43.670 --> 03:34:46.306
LEGISLATE- THAT REALLY ARE DE

03:34:46.373 --> 03:34:47.641
MINIMUS AND IT BECOMES

03:34:47.708 --> 03:34:49.776
DIFFICULT AND SO. WITH THIS

03:34:49.843 --> 03:34:51.612
BILL WE CAN NO LONGER HAVE

03:34:51.678 --> 03:34:53.580
EMPLOYEES EATING AT THEIR DESK

03:34:53.647 --> 03:34:55.782
AND WILL HAVE TO SEND THEM OUT

03:34:55.849 --> 03:34:56.650
OF THE BUILDING IN ORDER FOR

03:34:56.717 --> 03:35:01.154
HER SOMEWHERE IN A- IN THE CAN

03:35:01.221 --> 03:35:02.222
AND HAVE. PLAY WHERE PEOPLE CAN

03:35:02.289 --> 03:35:04.358
EAT. IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT

03:35:04.424 --> 03:35:05.559
THEY'RE NOT EATING AT THEIR

03:35:05.626 --> 03:35:07.427
DESK BECAUSE IT IS A VIOLATION

03:35:07.494 --> 03:35:08.328
OF THE LAW TO HAVE YOUR

03:35:08.395 --> 03:35:09.596
EMPLOYEES EATING AT THEIR DESK

03:35:09.663 --> 03:35:10.631
EVEN IF THEY WANT TO DO THAT

03:35:10.697 --> 03:35:11.431
AND THAT'S WHAT THEY FEEL

03:35:11.498 --> 03:35:14.334
COMFORTABLE WITH. SO BE CAREFUL

03:35:14.401 --> 03:35:15.836
WHAT YOU ASK FOR SO I

03:35:15.902 --> 03:35:18.071

TO ALL OF US EMPLOYERS IN THE

03:35:27.114 --> 03:35:28.749

THAT YOU KNOW YES THERE'S A FEW

03:35:38.191 --> 03:35:39.092
BAD ACTORS OUT THERE BUT THE

03:35:39.159 --> 03:35:41.695
MAJORITY OF THE RELATIONSHIPS

03:35:41.762 --> 03:35:43.563
BETWEEN PRIVATE. LAWYERS AND

03:35:43.630 --> 03:35:45.332
THEIR EMPLOYEES ARE NOT BAD

03:35:45.399 --> 03:35:46.733
THERE THERE'S A TWO WAY STREET

03:35:46.800 --> 03:35:48.335
AND WE NEED THEM THEY NEED US

03:35:48.402 --> 03:35:50.404

REALLY. WE SHOULD IF IT CAN YOU

03:36:36.116 --> 03:36:37.951

TO SOME OF THE THINGS WHERE WE

03:36:45.258 --> 03:36:45.992
SHOULD HAVE A LITTLE MORE

03:36:46.059 --> 03:36:46.993
COMMON SENSE AND MAYBE A LITTLE

03:36:47.060 --> 03:36:47.828
MORE GRAYSON PEOPLE ARE TRYING

03:36:47.894 --> 03:36:50.197

WAY THE STATE GATHERS AND

04:02:00.038 --> 04:02:02.407
SHARES INFORMATION TO FIGHT THE

04:02:04.276 --> 04:02:05.510
AS YOU KNOW MORE THAN A YEAR

INTO THE PANDEMIC WE STILL HAVE

04:02:07.679 --> 04:02:08.914
VERY LITTLE SCIENCE THAT

04:02:08.981 --> 04:02:10.949

04:02:11.016 --> 04:02:13.018
CAUSES COBIT NINE HAS SPREAD.

NOW GOOD SCIENCE DEPENDS ON

04:02:14.586 --> 04:02:18.690
GOOD DATA AND WE HAVE

04:02:18.757 --> 04:02:19.324
UNFORTUNATELY VERY LITTLE DATA.

04:02:19.391 --> 04:02:19.925
EVEN THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF

04:02:19.992 --> 04:02:21.627
PUBLIC HEALTH HAS A SYSTEM FOR

04:02:21.693 --> 04:02:23.829
SHARING DATA WITH BONA FIDE.

VULNERABLE RESIDENTS AT EVEN

04:02:43.615 --> 04:02:46.451
GREATER RISK. THIS BILL COULD

04:02:46.518 --> 04:02:49.221
CHANGE THAT. BY GATHERING

04:02:49.288 --> 04:02:50.822
BETTER DATA AND MAKING IT

04:02:50.889 --> 04:02:53.425
EASIER FOR RESEARCHERS TO USE

04:02:53.492 --> 04:02:55.227
FIRST WE WOULD GATHER MORE DATA

04:02:55.294 --> 04:02:58.163

WHICH WE BELIEVE TO BE A MAJOR

04:02:59.665 --> 04:03:01.867
SOURCES SPREAD. THEN WE WOULD

04:03:01.934 --> 04:03:04.169
IMPROVE OUR EXISTING SYSTEM FOR

04:03:04.236 --> 04:03:06.171
SHARING DATA WITH RESEARCHERS

04:03:06.238 --> 04:03:08.340
BY CREATING A FAST LANE TO

04:03:08.407 --> 04:03:09.274
ALLOW THEM TO SEE DATA IN REAL

04:03:09.341 --> 04:03:11.243
TIME WHEN THEIR ANALYSIS IS

04:03:11.310 --> 04:03:13.545
MOST NEEDED. TO INFORM BETTER

04:03:13.612 --> 04:03:17.282
POLICY. WE WOULD DO THIS. WHILE

LIVES LET ME JUST TELL YOU THAT

04:12:27.966 --> 04:12:29.834
IT WAS ABSOLUTELY PREDICTABLE.

04:12:29.901 --> 04:12:31.369
THAT FARMWORKERS WERE GONNA END

04:12:31.436 --> 04:12:33.204

THE BRUNT OF THIS VIRUS AND IT

04:12:35.406 --> 04:12:36.708

04:12:36.774 --> 04:12:38.309
CIRCUMSTANCES OF THEIR HOUSING

04:12:38.376 --> 04:12:39.844

REGARDS TO THESE THESE KINDS OF

04:12:54.359 --> 04:12:55.393
PANDEMICS AND IF WE'RE GOING TO

04:12:55.460 --> 04:12:57.362
HOLD THEM RESPONSIBLE WE ALSO

04:12:57.428 --> 04:12:58.663
NEED TO HAVE DATA AND

04:12:58.730 --> 04:13:01.566

THAT WE DO. OUR WORK FROM A

04:13:09.607 --> 04:13:11.009
PUBLIC HEALTH PERSPECTIVE

BEFORE THE PANDEMIC REACHES A

04:13:12.911 --> 04:13:15.113
CRISIS STAGE AND SO- I THINK

04:13:15.179 --> 04:13:16.114

IT REALLY EASY IN THE DAY. IN

04:13:27.292 --> 04:13:29.694
THE DAYS. A DATA PRODUCTION I

04:13:29.761 --> 04:13:31.563
FIND IT HARD TO BELIEVE THAT WE

04:13:31.629 --> 04:13:33.164
CAN GET THIS INFORMATION TO

04:13:33.231 --> 04:13:34.332
PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS SO THEY

04:13:34.399 --> 04:13:35.900
CAN MAKE. THEY CAN CREATE A

04:13:35.967 --> 04:13:37.735
PREVENTATIVE SYSTEM SO WITH

04:13:37.802 --> 04:13:39.737

IN SUPPORT OF- THIS BILL. I

04:13:57.221 --> 04:13:58.790
THINK ONE OF THE SHOCKING MORE

04:13:58.856 --> 04:14:00.425
SHOCKING EXPERIENCES I HAD

04:14:00.491 --> 04:14:03.261
DURING THE PANDEMIC. WAS US

04:14:03.328 --> 04:14:05.330
FIGURING OUT AT THE LOCAL LEVEL

04:14:05.396 --> 04:14:07.498
THEREFORE TO THE STATE LEVEL.

04:14:07.565 --> 04:14:09.334
IS THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH

04:14:09.400 --> 04:14:11.235
VIABLE INFORMATION THAT WILL

04:14:11.302 --> 04:14:13.972
ALLOW US TO BETTER UNDERSTAND-

04:14:14.038 --> 04:14:16.174
TRANSMISSION RATES BASED UPON

04:14:16.240 --> 04:14:18.509
INDUSTRY SECTORS. THAT WAS

04:14:18.576 --> 04:14:20.144
TERRIBLY IMPORTANT AS WE WERE

04:14:20.211 --> 04:14:21.846
DEALING WITH CLOSING AND

04:14:21.913 --> 04:14:24.015
OPENING AND WATER PUBLIC HEALTH

04:14:24.082 --> 04:14:24.716
POLICIES WERE GOING TO BE AT

04:14:24.782 --> 04:14:26.451
THE STATE LEVEL. NOW I

04:14:26.517 --> 04:14:27.552
UNDERSTAND THIS OF COURSE WAS A

04:14:27.619 --> 04:14:29.520
COMPLICATED SITUATION BUT I

04:14:29.587 --> 04:14:32.290
THINK. ACCUMULATING THIS

04:14:32.357 --> 04:14:35.360
INFORMATION. THEN NOT HAVING A

04:14:35.426 --> 04:14:37.528
DISCLOSURE OF IDENTIFYING

ON SOMEONE'S PRIVACY IN MY

04:14:41.199 --> 04:14:43.034
UNDERSTANDING THAT THIS HAS ALL

04:14:43.101 --> 04:14:44.569

04:14:47.705 --> 04:14:48.806

GREATEST EXTENT THAT IT'S

04:14:52.443 --> 04:14:54.912
NECESSARY- BUT I'M HAPPY TO

THIS IS- MORE ACTUAL PATH AS WE

04:14:59.384 --> 04:15:01.886

POOR REPORT AS AN EXAMPLE. IT

04:17:00.638 --> 04:17:01.572

THAT'S THE QUESTION IN THERE.

04:17:05.943 --> 04:17:07.211

SIZE OF THE HOUSEHOLD THAT'S AN

04:17:20.825 --> 04:17:22.293
EXAMPLE OF HOW WE CAN IMPROVE

04:17:22.360 --> 04:17:24.262

HAVING SOME FLEXIBILITY. I'M

05:26:36.076 --> 05:26:37.010

05:26:42.649 --> 05:26:44.618
BECAUSE- OTHERWISE IT'S HARDER

05:26:44.685 --> 05:26:48.188
AND THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO

05:26:48.255 --> 05:26:48.789

05:26:59.099 --> 05:27:00.100

HAS. ON THE RELATIONSHIPS

05:27:04.371 --> 05:27:06.173
BECAUSE IF I'M A LAWYER GENERAL

05:27:06.239 --> 05:27:08.075

05:27:08.141 --> 05:27:09.643

GOALS. ONE IS TO STOP

05:48:37.796 --> 05:48:40.065
IMMIGRATION CONTROL CONSULTANTS

05:48:40.132 --> 05:48:41.767
FROM PRACTICING LAW WITHOUT A

05:48:41.834 --> 05:48:47.539
LICENSE. AND THEREBY- ARGUING

05:48:47.606 --> 05:48:49.775
OR INJURING THE IMMIGRATION

05:48:49.842 --> 05:48:52.878
CASE AB OF THEIR CLIENTS-

05:48:52.945 --> 05:48:54.513
RESULTING IN DEPORTATION OR

05:48:54.580 --> 05:48:56.415

TO THE UNITED STATES NUMBER TWO

05:48:59.251 --> 05:49:01.220
TO PROTECT IMMIGRANT CONSUMERS

05:49:01.287 --> 05:49:03.055
FROM BEING PREYED UPON WHERE

05:49:03.122 --> 05:49:04.890
THEY GET CHARGED EXORBITANT

05:49:04.957 --> 05:49:06.091
FEES AND THEY'RE GIVEN FALSE

05:49:06.158 --> 05:49:09.461
HOPE AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO THE

05:49:09.528 --> 05:49:10.329
THOUGHT THAT THEY'RE GOING TO

05:49:10.396 --> 05:49:11.263
BE ABLE TO EMIGRATE WHEN THERE

05:49:11.330 --> 05:49:13.332
REALLY IS NO CHANCE FOR YEARS

05:49:13.399 --> 05:49:15.334
AGO I DID A BILL TO ELIMINATE

05:49:15.401 --> 05:49:16.602
THE PRACTICE OF THE IMMIGRATION

05:49:16.669 --> 05:49:18.470
CONSULTANTS AND THAT WAS NOT

05:49:18.537 --> 05:49:21.206
SUCCESSFUL LAST SESSION ANOTHER

05:49:21.273 --> 05:49:23.309
ATTEMPT WAS MADE AND THAT. ALSO

05:49:23.375 --> 05:49:25.344
WAS UNSUCCESSFUL SO FOR FOUR

05:49:25.411 --> 05:49:26.245
YEARS NOW WE TRY TO GET THIS

05:49:26.312 --> 05:49:28.347
DONE AND IT HAS NOT BEEN

05:49:28.414 --> 05:49:30.683
SUCCESSFUL TO ELIMINATE THE

05:49:30.749 --> 05:49:33.319
PRACTICE SO WHY DO IT NOW I

05:49:33.385 --> 05:49:34.253
BELIEVE I BELIEVE THAT

05:49:34.320 --> 05:49:35.921
IMMIGRAION REFORM IS IMMINENT

05:49:35.988 --> 05:49:37.623
AND THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

05:49:37.690 --> 05:49:39.958
IS FINALLY GOING TO TAKE ACTION

05:49:40.025 --> 05:49:43.762
TO RESOLVE- HOW IMMIGRANTS CAN-

05:49:43.829 --> 05:49:45.898
BECOME LEGALIZED CITIZENS IN

05:49:45.964 --> 05:49:46.832
THAT THAT'S MY HOPE AND MY

05:49:46.899 --> 05:49:50.369
PRAYER. MORE IMPORTANTLY WE

05:49:50.436 --> 05:49:51.904
NEED TO PROTECT IMMIGRANT

05:49:51.970 --> 05:49:53.505
CONSUMERS AND STOP THE ILLEGAL

05:49:53.572 --> 05:49:55.541
PRACTICE OF LAW AND WE NEED TO

05:49:55.607 --> 05:49:57.976
ALLOW THE THOUSANDS OF SMALL

05:49:58.043 --> 05:50:01.413
BUSINESS. ENTERPRISES TO

05:50:01.480 --> 05:50:02.981
CONTINUE. THE PRACTICE AS LONG

05:50:03.048 --> 05:50:04.316
AS THEY ARE FOLLOWING THE LAW

05:50:04.383 --> 05:50:05.884
THAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE IN THE

05:50:05.951 --> 05:50:07.720
DATA SHOWS VERY CLEARLY THAT.

05:50:07.786 --> 05:50:09.955
THAT A MAJORITY OF THE OF THE

05:50:10.022 --> 05:50:10.989
IMMIGRATION CONSULTANTS

05:50:11.056 --> 05:50:13.592
CURRENTLY ARE ARE WOMEN BECAUSE

05:50:13.659 --> 05:50:17.096
WOMEN OWNED BUSINESSES. SO SIX.

05:50:17.162 --> 05:50:18.664
SB SIX FIFTY FIFTY WOULD DO THE

05:50:18.731 --> 05:50:19.865
FOLLOWING IT WOULD CHANGE THE

05:50:19.932 --> 05:50:21.066
NAME OF THEIR IMMIGRATION

05:50:21.133 --> 05:50:23.135
CONSULTANTS TO ONE THAT IS MORE

05:50:23.202 --> 05:50:24.370
APPROPRIATE TO THE SERVICES

05:50:24.436 --> 05:50:25.938
THEY ARE AUTHORIZED TO PROVIDE.

05:50:26.004 --> 05:50:28.574
A PROVIDE WOULD LIMIT THE FORMS

05:50:28.640 --> 05:50:30.609
THEY CAN FILL OUT AND I'VE BY

05:50:30.676 --> 05:50:33.512
A- I'VE BEEN ASKED TO TAKE. TO

05:50:33.579 --> 05:50:35.314
LIMIT MORE FORMS AND WE'RE

05:50:35.381 --> 05:50:36.682
LOOKING AT THAT BECAUSE I THINK

05:50:36.749 --> 05:50:39.118
THAT MAKES MORE SENSE- THEY

05:50:39.184 --> 05:50:40.452
SHOULD NOT BE PRACTICING LAW

05:50:40.519 --> 05:50:41.520
SHOULD THEY SHOULD NOT BE

05:50:41.587 --> 05:50:42.721
GIVING LEGAL ADVICE OR IF

05:50:42.788 --> 05:50:43.756
THERE'S OTHER FORMS THAT THEY

05:50:43.822 --> 05:50:44.857
NEED TO BE RESTRICTED FROM

05:50:44.923 --> 05:50:46.759
USING THAT'S FINE. AND RESTRICT

05:50:46.825 --> 05:50:48.727
THE LANGUAGE CONSULTANTS USED

05:50:48.794 --> 05:50:51.397
TO DESCRIBE THEMSELVES. SO THAT

05:50:51.463 --> 05:50:52.998
THERE'S NO CONFUSION THEY ARE

05:50:53.065 --> 05:50:54.800
NOT ATTORNEYS NOR DO THEY HAVE

05:50:54.867 --> 05:50:56.435
THE EXPERTISE IN IMMIGRATION

05:50:56.502 --> 05:50:58.837
MATTERS. AND FINALLY THE TO

05:50:58.904 --> 05:51:00.139
REQUIRE AN EDUCATIONAL

05:51:00.205 --> 05:51:03.242
OBLIGATION THAT THEY- THAT THEY

05:51:03.308 --> 05:51:05.444
THEY PERFORM. A SUMMARY OF THE

05:51:05.511 --> 05:51:07.346
AMENDMENTS IS FOUND IN IN THE

05:51:07.413 --> 05:51:09.314
ANALYSIS AND SO I'M I'M NOT

05:51:09.381 --> 05:51:13.986
GOING TO REVIEW ALL OF THAT- IN.

05:51:14.052 --> 05:51:14.453
AND I'VE BEEN WORKING

05:51:14.520 --> 05:51:16.288
DILIGENTLY OVER THE PAST YEAR

05:51:16.355 --> 05:51:17.790
TO ENSURE THAT SMALL BUSINESSES

05:51:17.856 --> 05:51:18.590
IN OUR STATE RECEIVED THE

05:51:18.657 --> 05:51:20.659
FINANCIAL RESOURCES THEY NEED

05:51:20.726 --> 05:51:21.593
TO STAY AFLOAT DURING THE

05:51:21.660 --> 05:51:23.829
PANDEMIC. THESE FORM PREPARES

05:51:23.896 --> 05:51:25.497
ARE ALSO SMALL BUSINESSES AND

05:51:25.564 --> 05:51:28.834
AS I SAID. OVER 60% ARE.

05:51:28.901 --> 05:51:31.503
MINORITY OWNED WITH- BUSINESSES

05:51:31.570 --> 05:51:34.640
MINORITY WOMEN OWNED BUSINESSES

05:51:34.706 --> 05:51:35.207
AND I'VE BEEN PRACTICING FOR

05:51:35.274 --> 05:51:37.142
DECADES. AT A TIME WHEN SMALL

05:51:37.209 --> 05:51:38.243
BUSINESSES AND WOMEN OWNED

05:51:38.310 --> 05:51:40.112
BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN HIT. THE

05:51:40.179 --> 05:51:44.383
HARDEST. BY THIS PANDEMIC TO

05:51:44.450 --> 05:51:45.350
PUT THEM OUT OF BUSINESS

05:51:45.417 --> 05:51:46.785
BECAUSE THERE'S SOME BAD ACTORS

05:51:46.852 --> 05:51:48.387
DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE TO ME

05:51:48.454 --> 05:51:50.522
IT'S NOT LOGICAL AND IT'S NOT

05:51:50.589 --> 05:51:52.191
FAIR AND THIS IS AN EQUITY

05:51:52.257 --> 05:51:53.792
ISSUE I'M TRYING TO CARVE A

05:51:53.859 --> 05:51:55.260
MORE BALANCED APPROACH TO THIS

05:51:55.327 --> 05:51:56.662
IMPORTANT ISSUE BECAUSE NOT

05:51:56.728 --> 05:51:57.629
EVERYONE CAN AFFORD AN

05:51:57.696 --> 05:51:59.531
ATTORNEY. OR AS ACCESS TO A

05:51:59.598 --> 05:52:01.400
COMMUNITY ORGANIZATION THAT

05:52:01.467 --> 05:52:02.935
PROVIDES THE SERVICES AT A LOW

05:52:03.001 --> 05:52:04.570
COST THE NUMBER OF THE

05:52:04.636 --> 05:52:06.438
ORGANIZATIONS INCLUDING SOME OF

05:52:06.505 --> 05:52:08.140
THOSE WHO MAY TESTIFIED TODAY

05:52:08.207 --> 05:52:10.242
IN OPPOSITION. HAVE INDICATED

05:52:10.309 --> 05:52:12.511
THEY CURRENTLY SERVE 10215% OF

05:52:12.578 --> 05:52:13.946
THE IMMIGRANTS THAT WALK

05:52:14.012 --> 05:52:15.614
THROUGH THEIR DOOR LOOKING FOR

05:52:15.681 --> 05:52:17.616
SERVICES AND THAT'S DUE TO THE

05:52:17.683 --> 05:52:18.851
LACK OF CAPACITY IN THE

05:52:18.917 --> 05:52:21.186
ORGANIZATION. AFTER RECOGNIZE A

05:52:21.253 --> 05:52:22.988
COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS CANNOT

05:52:23.055 --> 05:52:24.957
MEET THE DEMAND ALONE AND THAT

05:52:25.023 --> 05:52:26.058
FORM PREPARES CAN WORK

05:52:26.124 --> 05:52:27.726
COLLABORATIVELY TO PROVIDE

05:52:27.793 --> 05:52:29.661

06:10:39.317 --> 06:10:42.753
SENATOR- WE'RE BOTH WE'VE HAD

06:10:42.820 --> 06:10:43.821
SEVERAL CONVERSATIONS AND WE'RE

06:10:43.888 --> 06:10:46.490
BOTH. ON THE SAME SIDE AS FAR

06:10:46.557 --> 06:10:48.526
TRYING TO FIX THS BUT I DON'T

06:10:48.593 --> 06:10:51.162
THINK THAT MORE RULES ARE GOING

06:10:51.228 --> 06:10:52.830
TO FIX IT I DON'T THINK THAT

06:10:52.897 --> 06:10:54.165
MORE WORK I THINK THAT MORE

06:10:54.231 --> 06:10:55.733
RULES ARE GOING TO MAKE THEM

06:10:55.800 --> 06:10:58.603
LOOK LEGITIMATE. BOMB AND I

06:10:58.669 --> 06:11:01.272
DON'T MEAN TO PUT EVERY SINGLE

06:11:01.339 --> 06:11:02.573
ONE OF WHO DOES THIS IN THE

06:11:02.640 --> 06:11:03.808
SAME BRACKET IN THE SAME

06:11:03.874 --> 06:11:06.911
CATEGORY BUT THEY ARE MOSTLY.

06:11:06.978 --> 06:11:09.413
DOING AN INJUSTICE TO OUR

06:11:09.480 --> 06:11:11.983
COMMUNITY- OTHERWISE THEY

06:11:12.049 --> 06:11:13.317
WOULDN'T HAVE A PROBLEM MEETING

06:11:13.384 --> 06:11:16.020
THE ACCREDITATION REQUIREMENTS

06:11:16.087 --> 06:11:17.655
I MEAN JUST THE FACT THAT

06:11:17.722 --> 06:11:19.357
THEY'RE PUT ON THE SAME LEVEL

06:11:19.423 --> 06:11:21.659
OF YOU KNOW EITHER YOU GO TO A

06:11:21.726 --> 06:11:23.294
BOARD OF ACCREDITATION GET

06:11:23.361 --> 06:11:24.261
PROPERLY TRAINED AND

06:11:24.328 --> 06:11:26.364
ACCREDITED. OR YOU KNOW TURNING

06:11:26.430 --> 06:11:27.098
OR YOU GO TO THE IMMIGRATION

06:11:27.164 --> 06:11:29.166
CONSULTANTS THEY AREN'T AT THAT

06:11:29.233 --> 06:11:30.635
LEVEL THAT'S NOT WHERE THEY

06:11:30.701 --> 06:11:35.139
SHOULD BE PUT. SO I REALLY- I

06:11:35.206 --> 06:11:37.575
THINK THAT WE SHOULD. CONTINUE

06:11:37.642 --> 06:11:39.110
TO DO THE OTHER SIDE WHICH IS

06:11:39.176 --> 06:11:41.946
THE OTHER DIRECTION WHICH IS

06:11:42.013 --> 06:11:44.315
NOT LEGITIMIZE THEM. OF FIGURE

06:11:44.382 --> 06:11:45.816
OUT THE FOR THE ENFORCEMENT AND

06:11:45.883 --> 06:11:48.119
LAST I WANT TO SAY. IS THAT OUR

06:11:48.185 --> 06:11:50.388
STATE HAS INVESTED TENS OF

06:11:50.454 --> 06:11:52.490
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO PROVIDE

06:11:52.556 --> 06:11:54.158
THE KIND OF REAL QUALITY

06:11:54.225 --> 06:11:56.260
SERVICES THAT OUR COMMUNITY

06:11:56.327 --> 06:11:58.462
DESERVES. EVERY PART OF OUR

06:11:58.529 --> 06:12:00.097
STATE WHERE THEY'RE IMMIGRANTS

06:12:00.164 --> 06:12:01.532
WE SHOULD BE PROVIDING THIS

06:12:01.599 --> 06:12:03.601
EVERY PART OF OUR STATE WE NEED

06:12:03.668 --> 06:12:05.970
TO EXPAND THE CAPACITY. AND I

06:12:06.037 --> 06:12:08.673
AM FEARFUL- NOT THAT THERE WILL

06:12:08.739 --> 06:12:10.574
BE A DOOR WHERE SOMEBODY COULD

06:12:10.641 --> 06:12:11.609
WALK IN AND SAY I NEED YOUR

06:12:11.676 --> 06:12:13.611
IMMIGRATION SERVICES BUT THAT

06:12:13.678 --> 06:12:14.512
WHEN THEY WALK THROUGH THAT

06:12:14.578 --> 06:12:18.916
DOOR THE GETTING LEGAL ADVICE.

06:12:18.983 --> 06:12:21.752
AND THE PROPER ADVICE BY A

06:12:21.819 --> 06:12:24.455
PROPERLY TRAINED PERSON- THAT'S

06:12:24.522 --> 06:12:25.456
WHAT I'M WORRIED ABOUT AND

06:12:25.523 --> 06:12:27.058
ESPECIALLY WHEN WE WHEN

06:12:27.124 --> 06:12:28.492
COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION

06:12:28.559 --> 06:12:33.230
REFORM SO UNFORTUNATELY. I

06:12:33.297 --> 06:12:34.298
CANNOT- SUPPORT THIS BILL YOU

06:12:34.365 --> 06:12:44.809

06:12:44.875 --> 06:12:47.912
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THERE

06:12:47.978 --> 06:12:49.847
IS A LAW CLINIC AT THE LAW

06:12:49.914 --> 06:12:52.316
SCHOOL AS A TEACHER IN COLOR A

06:12:52.383 --> 06:12:57.822
LITTLE BIT ABOUT. OTHER WORDS.

06:12:57.888 --> 06:12:59.090
FROM ONE LANGUAGE TO ANOTHER

06:12:59.156 --> 06:13:00.224
CAN MEAN TOTALLY DIFFERENT

06:13:00.291 --> 06:13:02.026
THINGS AND CAN HARKENS BACK TO

06:13:02.093 --> 06:13:04.628
THE HOLE ON THE TYDEUS

06:13:04.695 --> 06:13:06.397
RESISTIBLE GATHERS YOU KNOW A

06:13:06.464 --> 06:13:10.701
LAWYER VERSUS PREPARE AND HELP

06:13:10.768 --> 06:13:13.704
FOLKS WERE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF-

06:13:13.771 --> 06:13:14.338
THINKING THAT THEY WERE GETTING

06:13:14.405 --> 06:13:15.806
A SERVICE THAT THEY UNDERSTOOD

06:13:15.873 --> 06:13:18.576
IN THE HOME COUNTRY BUT IN

06:13:18.642 --> 06:13:20.778
THEIR NEW ADOPTED COUNTRY IT

06:13:20.845 --> 06:13:21.779
MEANT SOMETHING TOTALLY

06:13:21.846 --> 06:13:24.949
UNREGULATED AND- WITHOUT

06:13:25.015 --> 06:13:27.118
SUFFICIENT EXPERTISE. THAT THEY

06:13:27.184 --> 06:13:29.253
WERE EXPECTING I THINK THIS IS

06:13:29.320 --> 06:13:31.322
A VERY SMART WANT TO COMMEND

06:13:31.388 --> 06:13:34.759
THE CENTER FROM SALINAS THIS IS

06:13:34.825 --> 06:13:39.563
A VERY SMART WAY OF ALLOWING

06:13:39.630 --> 06:13:40.498
BUILDING BLOCKS- TO BE

06:13:40.564 --> 06:13:42.299
ESTABLISHED IN TERMS OF WHAT

06:13:42.366 --> 06:13:46.904
TERMINOLOGY IS APPROPRIATE- SO

06:13:46.971 --> 06:13:47.371
THERE'S SOME DEGREE OF

06:13:47.438 --> 06:13:49.473
CONSISTENCY. AND WHEN

06:13:49.540 --> 06:13:51.842
INDIVIDUALS DO NOT HAVE THE

06:13:51.909 --> 06:13:53.844
SUFFICIENT EXPERTISE BUT

06:13:53.911 --> 06:13:55.713
PRESENT THEMSELVES IN WAYS THAT

06:13:55.780 --> 06:13:57.114
ARE ANYTHING OTHER THAN

06:13:57.181 --> 06:13:58.849
DOCUMENT PREPARERS IT'S KINDA

06:13:58.916 --> 06:14:00.885

VIRTUE OF THEM GIVING THEM TO

06:14:15.332 --> 06:14:17.401
YOU. SOME FOLKS WERE THINKING

06:14:17.468 --> 06:14:19.470
THAT IT WAS VALIDATING WHAT.

06:14:19.537 --> 06:14:21.405
FORMS THEY WERE FILLING OUT.

06:14:21.472 --> 06:14:23.841
YOU CAN'T FIX ALL OF THE

06:14:23.908 --> 06:14:25.709
UNEXPECTED EXPECTATIONS OF A

06:14:25.776 --> 06:14:27.478
CONSUMER BUT YOU CAN CERTAINLY

06:14:27.545 --> 06:14:29.246

SET OF TERMINOLOGIES SO I'M

06:14:31.749 --> 06:14:34.685
