TO FILE ITEM THREE SB THREE EIGHTY ONE SENATOR PORTANTINO GOOD TO SEE YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS- EIGHTY ONE HAS ONLY BEEN SIXTY YEARS IN THE MAKING. AND I'M HAPPY TO HAVE IT HERE- BEFORE YOU- IT MAKES CHANGES IN THE DISPOSITION OF THE SEVEN ARE TEN HOMES PROCESS WHICH ARE OWNED BY CALTRANS IT'S- POLICE HAVE SOLVED A LOT OF PROBLEMS IT GIVES THE EXISTING TENANTS. OF MANY OF WHOM HAVE BEEN IN THERE FOR DECADES- MORE RIGHTS TO PURCHASE THE HOMES THAT THEY'VE BEEN LIVING IN. IT GIVES THE CITY OF THOUGHT SOUTH PASADENA THE ABILITY TO pACQUISITION PRICE IT PRESERVES HISTORIC HOMES BUT ALSO MOST IMPORTANTLY AS A THREE TO ONE MULTIPLIER TO FOR EVERY HOME THEY GET SOLD AT MARKET RATE- THE STORE COMES THE CITY WOULD HAVE TO PROVIDE THREE AFFORDABLE UNITS AND SO. THAT IS A SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENT IN THE CITY IN A CORRIDOR THAT. THE NEEDS OF PORTABLE HOUSING IT ALSO GETS CALTRANS OUT OF THE HOUSING BUSINESS- WHICH WE WANT TO DO FOR THE LAST SEVERAL DECADES AND I HAVE TO GIVE A BIG SHOUT OUT TO MY STAFF TO CALTRANS STATE CD THE CITY OF SOUTH PASADENA ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS TO COME TOGETHER. WE'VE GOTTEN INPUT FROM THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE- WE'VE REALLY WORKED HARD TO GET THE BILL IN THE SHAPE IT'S IN AND OUT RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE WHEN APPROPRIATE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK ON THIS- ONE WE NOW GO TO YOUR MAIN WITNESS ON THE TELEPHONE ANDERSTON THE MAYOR. OF SOUTH PASADENA. IS ON TO THE OPERATOR. YES HELLO CAN YOU HEAR ME WE SURE CAN. WALK IN THERE EXCELLENT MY NAME IS DIANA MAHMUD I'M PRESENTLY THE MAYOR AND THE CITY OF SOUTH PASADENA. AND WE ARE SO EXCITED TO BE ON THE PRECIPICE OF HAVING THIS BILL. FINALLY BE ENACTED BECAUSE AS- SENATOR. SAID WE HAVE LONG HELD CALTRANS HOMES IN OUR PROPERTY THEY HAVEN'T BEEN WELL MAINTAINED MANY ARE IN THE STATE OF EXTREME DISREPAIR. AND IF CALTRANS KNEW THAT IT LIKELY WOULD NOT BE- CONSTRUCTING THE FREE WAY. IT DID NOT. HAVE RENT THE HOMES AND SO MANY OF THE HOMES ARE VACANT. AND AFFECTS THEY REALLY HAVE BEEN THE SOURCE OF EXTREME CONCERN WITH THE POTENTIAL. FOR POLITE AND BREAK INS- CALTRANS FACES VARIOUS SAFETY IN THE SENATE CONSEQUENCES THAT THE NEGLECTED. PROPERTIES AND WE ARE STILL EXCITED NOW FINALLY. TO ACHIEVE WHAT I BELIEVE IS A WIN WIN FOR BOTH THE STATE AND FOR. MY RESIDENTS AND I MIGHT POINT OUT THAT AND MY CITY HAS FORGONE. PROPERTY TAX REVENUE WERE VERY SMALL CITY. THREE AND A HALF SQUARE MILES WE HAVE NO BIG BOX- THE MAJORITY OF OUR REVENUE COMES FROM- FROM PROPERTY TAX REVENUE OVER TWENTY SIX THOUSAND RESIDENTS HALF OF MY- RESIDENTS ARE HOMEOWNERS- HALF OF THEM ARE RANCHERS. HALF OF THEM LIVE IN MULTI FAMILY UNITS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I THINK REALLY SET SOUTH PASADENA PART. IS THE FACT THAT WE WERE ESTABLISHED IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY EIGHT WE HAVE A NUMBER OF HITORIC HOMES. THE AMENDMENT TO THIS BILL THAT NAPLES IS TO SELL THOSE HISTORIC HOMES AT MARKET VALUE AND THEN USE THE PROCEEDS. TO DEVELOP AFFORDABLE HOUSING ON A THREE TO ONE BASIS IS KEY BECAUSE- WE HAVE ONE OF THE BEST SCHOOL. DISTRICTS IN THE REGION IF NOT THE STATE AND WITH SO MANY. IT I IT IS A PERSONAL- OBJECTIVES STRONG OBJECTIVE OF MINE TO BE ABLE TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN OUR CITY AND SB THREE EIGHTY ONE PARTICULARLY WITH ITS MOST RECENT AMENDMENTS- AND ALSO. ALLOWING THE CITY TO REQUIRE THE PROPERTIES WHICH HAVE BEEN HELD BY CALTRANS FOR DECADES HAVE NOT BEEN WELL MAINTAINED WE BELIEVE THERE'S GOING TO BE AN AWFUL LOT OF- HEAT. AND REPAIR TO THE HOMES BEFORE THEY CAN BE MADE IN GOOD CONDITION FOR OUR AFFORDABLE. CANNONS AND WE'RE EXCITED TO DO THAT WE CERTAINLY URGE YOUR STRONG SUPPORT FOR SB THREE EIGHTY ONE.

EARLIER IN THE YEAR BEFORE THE ASSEMBLY DEADLINES- BUT MANY OF THE PROVISIONS FROM THAT BILL WERE ADOPTED AND BUDGET TRAILER AND THE HOUSING ACCOUNTABILITY BUDGET TRAILER- THIS WE INCLUDED SOME ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS THAT YOU'RE HEARING TODAY- TO ESSENTIALLY CONTINUE THE ABILITY OF OUR STATE'S HOUSING FOR HEALTHY CALIFORNIA PROGRAM. BY REQUIRING THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND COMMUTED ALL MEANT TO PRIORITIZE NATIONAL HOUSING TRUST FUND MONIES FOR PROPERTIES THAT SERVE INDIVIDUALS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS WHERE SERVICES ARE PAID FOR THROUGH MEDICAL BENEFITS IN THE CONTEXT OF THIS IS. WE KNOW THAT FOR SO MANY CHRONICALLY HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS BEING CURSED SIGNIFICANT THAT DISPROPORTIONATE MEDICAL COSTS ENERGY POOR HEALTH OUTCOMES WE'RE TALKING ABOUT INDIVIDUALS WHO EXPERIENCE A COMBINATION OF AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE SITUATIONS AS WELL AS SOCIAL DETERMINANTS THAT IMPACT THEIR ABILITY TO ACCESS CARE WE KNOW THAT HOMELESSNESS OFTEN CREATES A INSIST AND INSTITUTIONAL CIRCUIT. WHERE FOLKS ARE CYCLING FROM THE STREETS TO EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS TO INPATIENT ADMISSIONS INCARCERATIONS NURSING HOME STAYS WHICH IS VERY EXPENSIVE AND WE ARE CONTINUING- THE FUNDING FOR THIS BILL- TO ADDRESS THE FACT THAT IF WE ARE PROVIDING SUPPORT HOUSING OPTIONS WE WOULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCING THE COSTS. TO THE TUNE OF TENS OF BILLIONS TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS PER INDIVIDUAL ABOUT THE COST OF HOUSING AND SERVICES THE STATE HAS HISTORICALLY RECEIVED ABOUT THIRTY TO FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN THIS FUNDING EVERY YEAR JUST WANNA CONTEXTUALIZE. ARE THAT AT THIS MOMENT CONGRESS IS CONSIDERING ALLOCATING OVER THREE POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS TO CALIFORNIA FOR THIS FUN THIS YEAR THIS BILL WOULD ONLY REQUIRE FUNDS TO GO TO PROJECTS FOR PERSONS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS TO THE EXTENT THAT QUALIFYING PROJECTS APPLY.

AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHU STATED AB EIGHT ONE SIX PRIORITIZE CALIFORNIA'S NATIONAL HOUSING TRUST FUNDS. TO HOW CALIFORNIANS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS- FOR ALL THE REASONS THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHEESE THAT THEIR STATE HAS AN INTEREST IN PRIORITIZING THIS POPULATION. PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS- ALSO DIED TWENTY FIVE- TO THIRTY YEARS YOUNGER THAN THEIR HOUSE COUNTERPARTS- AS WE EXPECT INCREASES IN THE NATIONAL HOUSING TRUST FUND. AB EIGHT ONE SIX PROVIDES MORE OPPORTUNITY TO CREATE MORE SUPPORTIVE HOUSING AND TO SERVE OUR POPULATION OUR STATE HAVE LONG NEGLECTED. THOSE ON FIXED INCOMES OR RECEIVING LOW WAGES AND SO CANNOT ACCESS OR SUSTAIN HOUSING AFFORDABILITY. EVEN THOUGH THIS POPULATION MAKES UP ABOUT 60% OF CALIFORNIANS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS OUR CAPITAL PROGRAMS TYPICALLY DO NOT SEARCH THEM. AB EIGHT SIXTEEN STILL ABOUT THE H. CITY TO FUND OTHER PROJECTS WITH NATIONAL HOUSING TRUST FUND IT'S SIMPLY PRIORITIZES THESE FUNDS FOR ONE OF THE STATE'S LARGEST PRIORITIES.

AND ALSO THANK THE CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE FOR BRINGING BACK- THIS BILL TO US AS IT'S AN EXTREMELY MEANINGFUL ON JUST GONNA READ FROM OUR- NOTES HERE BUT IT'S STUDY AFTER STUDY SHOWS SUPPORTIVE HOUSING. DECREASES EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT VISITS HOSPITAL INPATIENT STAYS STAYS NURSING HOME DAYS AND PSYCHIATRY PSYCH PSYCHIATRIC INPATIENT ADMISSIONS SAVING BETWEEN. THREE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED AND FORTY ONE AND TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND PER BENEFICIARY ABOVE THE COST OF HOUSING AND SERVICES. THIS IS AN EXTREMELY MEANINGFUL AND THROUGHOUT THE STATE I KNOW ON OUR RECESS SOME OF THE HOUSING MEMBERS ARE GOING TO BE REALLY INVESTIGATING LOOKING AT DATA AND TRYING TO DEFINE WHAT CAN WE DO THAT WE'RE NOT DOING AND WHAT ARE BEST PRACTICES. BUT WHAT I WILL SAY IS RIGHT NOW. FULLERTON HOSTS A RECUPERATIVE CENTER AND THIS ON NOT ONLY ALLOWS PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS BUT ALSO IF SOMEBODY IS FACING A HEALTH CRISIS AND WHEN THEY ARE RELEASED FROM THE HOSPITAL THEY ARE THEN ABLE TO. AN EIGHT S. AND STAYED THERE. TO RECUPERATE AS WE KNOW IF THEY GO BACK TO THE STREETS WE'RE TALKING MORE TAXPAYER DOLLARS SO AS WE- START TO FOCUS IN ON THESE BILLIONS OF HOUSING DOLLARS. I THINK ONE OF OUR GOALS HAS TO BE HOW DO WE TRACK USE DATA TO FIND OUT THE BEST WAYS TO NOT ONLY SERVE PEOPLE WHO ARE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS BUT ALSO THE NEXT STEPS FOR THEM AND RECUPERATIVE CARE CERTAINLY IS PART OF THAT. SO I'M REALLY PROUD TO BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL TODAY THANK YOU I THANK YOU ANY OTHER MEMBERS. IF NOT. MR TO THANK YOU EVENT OUR MOTION SECOND I WICKS IN A SECOND BISOLA.
