CHANGE THE DYNAMIC SO THAT-

01:12:14.029 --> 01:12:16.632
FEWER SHIPS ARE SIMPLY ANCHORING

VEHICLE. PROGRAM WERE TO HAVE A

01:34:55.523 --> 01:34:57.358

SIGNIFICANTLY MORE EXPENSIVE FOR

01:35:04.598 --> 01:35:07.268
CONSUMERS IS THAT. SOMETHING

01:35:07.334 --> 01:35:11.672
THAT CAN BE. QUANTIFIED CAN THE

COUPLE YEARS OUT BEFORE THAT

01:37:18.132 --> 01:37:18.966
THAT TECHNOLOGY IS READILY

01:37:19.033 --> 01:37:20.568
AVAILABLE IN THAT IT WOULD BE IN

01:37:20.634 --> 01:37:22.570
THE HEAVY DUTY AREA. FOR US TO

01:37:22.636 --> 01:37:24.872
BE ABLE TO MAKE SUCH A SUCH

01:37:24.939 --> 01:37:26.140
LARGE PURCHASES KNOWS HAVE KNOWS

01:37:26.207 --> 01:37:28.442

IS IF TRACK IT IN THE FUTURE

01:37:48.262 --> 01:37:49.597
BECAUSE THE DIESEL POWER SWEEPER

01:37:49.663 --> 01:37:52.199
COST NEARLY SAY THREE HUNDRED

01:37:52.266 --> 01:37:53.300
THOUSAND. A NEW ELECTRIC

01:37:53.367 --> 01:37:55.336
SWEEPERS GO TO COST SIX HUNDRED

01:37:55.402 --> 01:37:57.638
AND FIFTY THOUSAND BUT I'D LIKE

01:37:57.705 --> 01:37:59.440
SOME UPDATE FOR MAINTENANCE

01:37:59.506 --> 01:38:01.275
BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE A DIESEL.

01:38:01.342 --> 01:38:03.877
SWEEPER CAN RUN ALL DAY LONG YOU

01:38:03.944 --> 01:38:05.746
JUST FILL IT BACK UP BUT

01:38:05.813 --> 01:38:07.715
ELECTRIC SWEEPER OR BOTH THE

01:38:07.781 --> 01:38:10.117
HEAVY DUTY TRUCK HOW MUCH TIME

01:38:10.184 --> 01:38:11.819
ARE YOU GOING TO BE ABLE TO RUN

01:38:11.885 --> 01:38:13.320
THAT VEHICLE DURING THE DAY AS

01:38:13.387 --> 01:38:14.822
WE MOVE FORWARD INTO THIS OF.

01:38:14.888 --> 01:38:16.390
ELECTRIC FUTURE THAT WE'RE GOING

01:38:16.457 --> 01:38:17.758
TO TRY TO PUSH IN CALIFORNIA BUT

01:38:17.825 --> 01:38:19.827
I WOULD LIKE SOME COMPARISON AND

01:38:19.893 --> 01:38:20.728
MAINTENANCE AND COST AS WE GO

01:38:20.794 --> 01:38:21.962
THROUGH THIS BECAUSE STARTED

01:38:22.029 --> 01:38:23.731
TWICE AS MUCH COST BUT IT MAYBE

01:38:23.797 --> 01:38:27.635
YOU GET HALF AS MUCH TIME AS

01:38:27.701 --> 01:38:29.470

01:38:29.536 --> 01:38:31.572
IT WE MOVE FOR THANKS FOR THE

01:38:31.639 --> 01:38:32.273
QUESTION ASSEMBLY WILL

01:38:57.731 --> 01:38:59.600
ALREADY HAVE SOME SITES MAYBE

01:38:59.667 --> 01:39:00.968
THEY GET THE ELECTRIC VEHICLES

01:39:01.035 --> 01:39:03.103
VERSUS A SITE THAT DOESN'T HAVE

01:39:03.170 --> 01:39:03.771

KNOW THAT THE NUMBER OF- OF

01:45:06.833 --> 01:45:09.269
PEDESTRIANS ARE INCREASING- WE

01:45:09.336 --> 01:45:11.138
WANT TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO USE

01:45:11.204 --> 01:45:15.409
OUR STREETS. AND THE OF COURSE-

01:45:15.475 --> 01:45:17.477
BICYCLISTS AS WELL ARE ON THE

01:45:17.544 --> 01:45:20.047
INCREASE AND THAT MAY BE PART OF

01:45:20.113 --> 01:45:21.848
WHAT'S DRIVING THESE NUMBERS BUT

01:45:21.915 --> 01:45:24.084
IT WOULD BE INTERESTING TO KNOW

01:45:24.151 --> 01:45:27.320
WHETHER IT IS- DRIVER BEHAVIOR

01:45:27.387 --> 01:45:29.022
IN ATTENTION BY ADMIN THERE'S

01:45:29.089 --> 01:45:30.357
LOTS OF OTHER THINGS THAT MIGHT

01:45:30.424 --> 01:45:33.293
BE CONTRIBUTING TO THIS- IN

01:45:33.360 --> 01:45:35.829
INCREASED NUMBERS AND TO- ONCE

01:45:35.896 --> 01:45:38.265
WE UNDERSTAND THAT WE CAN- A

01:45:38.331 --> 01:45:40.200
BETTER ADDRESS WHAT THE- THE

01:45:40.267 --> 01:45:42.636
BETTER JUST PREVENTIVE MEASURES.

01:45:42.703 --> 01:45:45.338
MS FRIEDMAN. YEAH I GUESS IT'S

01:45:45.405 --> 01:45:46.707
NOT A QUESTION SO MUCH AS A

01:45:46.773 --> 01:45:48.675
COMMENT I COMPLETELYAGREE WITH

01:45:48.742 --> 01:45:50.610
THE CHAIR AND I APPRECIATE YOUR-

01:45:50.677 --> 01:45:52.312
PUTTING A- EMPHASIS ON THIS

01:45:52.379 --> 01:45:54.014
PARTICULAR ITEM AND THIS IS

01:45:54.081 --> 01:45:55.515
REALLY A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS AT

01:45:55.582 --> 01:45:57.617
THIS POINT. AND IT'S ALSO

01:45:57.684 --> 01:46:00.153
SOMETHING THAT IS- TOUCHING A

01:46:00.220 --> 01:46:01.588
LOT OF OTHER REALLY IMPORTANT

01:46:01.655 --> 01:46:03.156
ISSUES ON YOU KNOW EQUITY

01:46:03.223 --> 01:46:05.826
ISSUES- BECAUSE YOU KNOW A LOT

01:46:05.892 --> 01:46:07.661
OF PEOPLE WHO CYCLE AROUND DO SO

01:46:07.728 --> 01:46:10.030
BECAUSE THEY CAN'T AFFORD A CAR

01:46:10.097 --> 01:46:10.831
THIS IS THE PRIMARY MODE OF

01:46:10.897 --> 01:46:11.364
TRANSPORTATION PEOPLE ARE

01:46:11.431 --> 01:46:13.066
WALKING. THE SAME REASON THERE'S

01:46:13.133 --> 01:46:14.201
PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACTS BECAUSE

01:46:14.267 --> 01:46:15.569
BESIDES YOU KNOW GETTING HIT BY

01:46:15.635 --> 01:46:17.671
A CAR IS NOT HEALTHY FOR YOU BUT

01:46:17.738 --> 01:46:20.240
IF YOU'RE FREE TO GO OUT AND

01:46:20.307 --> 01:46:20.807
RIDE YOUR BIKE OR WALK- OF

01:46:20.874 --> 01:46:23.043
COURSE IT'S A LOT LESS HEALTHY I

01:46:23.110 --> 01:46:25.112
MEAN I. FOR ONE AM AFRAID TO LET

01:46:25.178 --> 01:46:26.379
MY OWN DAUGHTER RIDE HER BIKE IN

01:46:26.446 --> 01:46:27.914
MY NEIGHBORHOOD BECAUSE WE DON'T

01:46:27.981 --> 01:46:29.316
HAVE SIDEWALKS AND I'M NERVOUS

01:46:29.382 --> 01:46:30.851
ABOUT HER BEING ON THE STREET.

01:46:30.917 --> 01:46:32.719
AND THAT'S NOT FAIR TO HER SHE

01:46:32.786 --> 01:46:34.688
SHOULD BE ABLE TO RIDE A BIKE IN

01:46:34.755 --> 01:46:36.656
THE STREET LIKE. SO MANY OF US

01:46:36.723 --> 01:46:38.225
DID WHEN WE WERE GROWING UP-

01:46:38.291 --> 01:46:40.026
BESIDES TRYING TO GET TO THE

01:46:40.093 --> 01:46:41.228
ROOT CAUSE OF WHAT'S BEHIND

01:46:41.294 --> 01:46:43.597
THESE. THESE TRAGEDIES I WOULD

01:46:43.663 --> 01:46:46.399
ALSO THROUGH- ADD TO THAT THE-

01:46:46.466 --> 01:46:48.502
SOME UNDERSTANDING AT SOME POINT

01:46:48.568 --> 01:46:49.870
I KNOW THIS PROBABLY ISN'T THE

01:46:49.936 --> 01:46:51.638
RIGHT PLACE BUT I DON'T

01:46:51.705 --> 01:46:53.173
UNDERSTAND IT. THESE INCIDENTS

01:46:53.240 --> 01:46:55.475
ARE HANDLED BY PROSECUTORS

01:46:55.542 --> 01:46:57.344
INCLUDE- I'VE HEARD FEEDBACK

01:46:57.410 --> 01:46:59.246
FROM THE BICYCLE COMMUNITY

01:46:59.312 --> 01:46:59.813
PARTICULARLY THAT MANY TIMES

01:46:59.880 --> 01:47:01.782
THINGS THAT REALLY SHOULD BE.

01:47:01.848 --> 01:47:03.517
PROSECUTED AS- RECKLESS DROPS.

01:47:03.583 --> 01:47:06.419
OR SOME SORT OF VEHICLE

01:47:06.486 --> 01:47:09.222
INFRACTION OR NOT THAT IT'S

01:47:09.289 --> 01:47:25.505
CHALKED UP TO

01:47:36.149 --> 01:47:40.520
THE BEHAVIOR OF THE CYCLIST OR

01:47:40.587 --> 01:47:41.588
THE BEHAVIOR OF THE DRIVER BUT

01:47:41.655 --> 01:47:43.924
THERE'S A REASON WHY THIS

01:47:43.990 --> 01:47:44.457
HAPPENED JUST AS THE MOST

01:47:44.524 --> 01:47:45.992
ASTEROID FALLS IN THE SKY AND

01:47:46.059 --> 01:47:48.595
CAUSES THIS OR A TREE FALLS ON

01:47:48.662 --> 01:47:49.796
SOMEONE THAT'S AN ACCIDENT. BUT

01:47:49.863 --> 01:47:52.232
A TRAFFIC ACCIDENT IS NOT

01:47:52.299 --> 01:47:52.866
ACTUALLY AN ACCIDENT SOMETHING

01:47:52.933 --> 01:47:54.301
WENT WRONG IF WE DON'T LOOK AT

01:47:54.367 --> 01:47:56.403
WHAT THAT IS WE'RE NEVER GOING

01:47:56.469 --> 01:47:57.504
TO BE ABLE TO SOLVE FOR IT. SO

01:47:57.571 --> 01:47:59.439
I'LL JUST PUT IT THAT YOU KNOW

01:47:59.506 --> 01:48:01.575
WE DON'T WE DON'T SAY WHEN THEIR

01:48:01.641 --> 01:48:02.642
PLANE CRASHES LIKE HEY JUST AN

01:48:02.709 --> 01:48:04.244
ACCIDENT THESE THINGS HAPPEN

01:48:04.311 --> 01:48:05.412
WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON WE REALLY

01:48:05.478 --> 01:48:07.514
INVESTIGATE IT A LOT MORE PEOPLE

01:48:07.581 --> 01:48:08.348
KILLED. IN CAR CRASHES IN BY

01:48:08.415 --> 01:48:09.950
PLANE CRASHES AND YET WE SORT OF

01:48:10.016 --> 01:48:11.952
JUST SAID HEY THAT'S JUST

01:48:12.018 --> 01:48:12.786
COLLATERAL DAMAGE IS THE WAY IT

01:48:12.853 --> 01:48:14.621
IS SO I THINK WE NEED A LOT MORE

01:48:14.688 --> 01:48:17.357
FOCUS ON THIS AND I DON'T KNOW

01:48:17.424 --> 01:48:18.725
WHETHER IT'S- MAKING A BUDGETARY

01:48:18.792 --> 01:48:19.659

INVESTIGATIONS ON- AT SOME POINT

01:48:30.937 --> 01:48:32.272

WHETHER- WE'RE ACTUALLY.

I LOST MY THREAD A LITTLE WHEN I

01:50:45.205 --> 01:50:46.639
WAS TALKING ABOUT ONE OF THE I

01:50:46.706 --> 01:50:48.041
THINK WHAT I'M ASKING FOR IS IF

01:50:48.108 --> 01:50:49.609
IT THAT WE HAVE IF WEHAVE DATA

01:50:49.676 --> 01:50:51.478
THAT SAYS THAT FOR INSTANCE A

01:50:51.544 --> 01:50:52.645
VEHICLE VEHICLES THE DRIVERS

01:50:52.712 --> 01:50:54.547
WERE AT FAULT AND SOME OF THESE

01:50:54.614 --> 01:50:55.682
INCIDENTS I THINK IT WOULD ALSO

01:50:55.749 --> 01:50:57.517
BE HELPFUL TO FIND OUT HOW MANY

01:50:57.584 --> 01:50:58.685
OF THOSE RESULTED IN SOME SORT

01:50:58.752 --> 01:51:02.489
OF- AS SOME SORT OF EITHER

01:51:02.555 --> 01:51:03.623
CRIMINAL CHARGE OR OR INFRACTION

01:51:03.690 --> 01:51:06.426
CHARGE FOR THE DRIVER BECAUSE

01:51:06.493 --> 01:51:07.994
THIS IS A COMMON COMPLAINT THAT

01:51:08.061 --> 01:51:09.362
I'VE GOTTEN FROM THE BICYCLE

01:51:09.429 --> 01:51:10.363
COMMUNITY THAT. THE DRIVER WAS

01:51:10.430 --> 01:51:11.664
AT FAULT HIT A CYCLIST AND

01:51:11.731 --> 01:51:13.299
NOTHING'S DONE- BECAUSE IT'S

01:51:13.366 --> 01:51:14.100
JUST CONSIDERED LIKE HEY YOU

01:51:14.167 --> 01:51:15.635
KNOW IT'S AN ACCIDENT OR OR EVEN

01:51:15.702 --> 01:51:16.703
SOMETIMES LAW ENFORCEMENT NOT

01:51:16.770 --> 01:51:18.805
UNDERSTANDING WHO IS REALLY AT

01:51:18.872 --> 01:51:20.974
FAULT AND THAT YOU KNOW KNOW

01:51:21.041 --> 01:51:22.542
THAT THERE WAS A RESPONSIBILITY

01:51:22.609 --> 01:51:24.277
TO NOT HIT THE PRO ATHLETE YOU

01:51:24.344 --> 01:51:26.146
KNOW BE MORE FOR THE DRIVER AND

01:51:26.212 --> 01:51:28.915
SO THERE'S THE FEEL THAT THERE'S

01:51:28.982 --> 01:51:30.116
NOT ENOUGH ENFORCEMENT OF THE

01:51:30.183 --> 01:51:31.451
RULES THAT ARE MEANT TO KEEP

01:51:31.518 --> 01:51:33.586

01:51:33.653 --> 01:51:35.555
DATA TO ALSO SAY. IF THERE WERE

01:51:35.622 --> 01:51:37.290
20% OF THE TIMES WHERE THE

01:51:37.357 --> 01:51:39.059
VEHICLE WAS FOUND TO BE AT FAULT

01:51:39.125 --> 01:51:40.326
WITH A COLLISION HOW OFTEN DID

01:51:40.393 --> 01:51:43.063
THOSE RESULT IN SOME SORT OF

01:51:43.129 --> 01:51:43.730
ENFORCEMENT ACTION AGAINST THAT

01:51:43.797 --> 01:51:47.100

02:55:42.965 --> 02:55:46.469
QUESTION ON THIS HAS TO DO WITH-

02:55:46.535 --> 02:55:51.440
THE- IT WOULD STRIKE ME THAT-

02:55:51.507 --> 02:55:54.577
THE SMALLER- UNITS AROUND THE

02:55:54.644 --> 02:55:58.681
STATE WOULD- BENEFIT FROM HAVING

02:55:58.748 --> 02:56:00.683
A CENTRALIZED SYSTEM SINCE IT

02:56:00.750 --> 02:56:02.652
PROBABLY TAKES A GREATER

02:56:02.718 --> 02:56:04.787

02:56:14.130 --> 02:56:15.464

WE LOOKED AT OUR STRUCTURE THE

02:56:17.667 --> 02:56:18.534

02:56:18.601 --> 02:56:19.735

HEADQUARTERS IN SACRAMENTO WE

02:56:22.171 --> 02:56:24.240

SOME OF OUR LARGER. I'M CENTERS

02:56:27.810 --> 02:56:29.578
AND THEN IT'S EASIER FOR US TO

02:56:29.645 --> 02:56:32.415
PUSH IT OUT IN THE END AND DEAL

02:56:32.481 --> 02:56:33.449
WITH THOSE ISSUES THAT MAY BE IN

02:56:33.516 --> 02:56:35.418
OUR LARGER CENTERS AND THEN WE I

02:56:35.484 --> 02:56:36.953
MEAN THIS IT WON'T BE LONG

02:56:37.019 --> 02:56:38.688
BEFORE WE INCLUDE THEM BUT IT

02:56:38.754 --> 02:56:40.356

OVERSIGHT OVER THE FOUR. AND

02:56:42.825 --> 02:56:44.894
THEN PUSHING IT OUT BECAUSE WE

02:56:44.961 --> 02:56:45.861
KNOW THE SYSTEM THAT WE'RE USING

02:56:45.928 --> 02:56:48.931

HAD TO GET THEM TRAINED WE HAVE

02:56:55.671 --> 02:56:57.406
