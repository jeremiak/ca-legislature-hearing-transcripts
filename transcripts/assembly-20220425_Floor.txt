SOME PEOPLE SIXTEEN FIFTY TWO BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER MEDINA BACK IN SCHOOL GOVERNMENT'S. ASSEMBLY MEMBER MEDINA YOU ARE RECOGNIZED AT YOUR DESK THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER IN MEMBERS AB SIXTEEN FIFTY TWO CODIFIES THE RECENT ATTORNEY GENERAL'S LEGAL OPINION. THAT AN EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OR EMPLOYEE OF A CHARTER SCHOOL MAY NOT SERVE AS A MEMBER OF THE COUNTY BOARD OF EDUCATION IN THE COUNTY WHERE THEIR EMPLOYEES SCHOOL IS LOCATED. EXISTING LAW PROHIBITS AN EMPLOYEE OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICT FROM BEING AN ELECTED OR APPOINTED MEMBER OF THAT SCHOOL DISTRICT'S GOVERNING BOARD UNLESS AND UNTIL THEY RESIGNED AS AN EMPLOYEE. AB SIXTEEN FIFTY TWO APPLIES THE SAME LIMITATION TO ANY EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OR CHARTER SCHOOL EMPLOYEE FROM SERVING ON THE CHARTER SCHOOLS AUTHORIZING SCHOOL DISTRICT GOVERNING BOARD PROCESS FOR THE IMPACTED SITTING BOARD MEMBERS TO FINISH THEIR RESPECTIVE TERMS OF OFFICE. THIS BILL IS A SIMPLE SOLUTION TO ENSURE FAIR AND DIVERSE REPRESENTATION FOR PARENTS TEACHERS AND OUR STUDENTS ON LOCAL SCHOOL BOARDS. CHARTER SCHOOLEXECUTIVES OR EMPLOYEES SERVING ON EDUCATION BOARDS IN THEIR SCHOOLS JURISDICTION IS A CONFLICT OF INTEREST AND AB SIXTEEN FIFTY TWO WILL PREVENT ANY CONFLICTS OF INTEREST AND ESTABLISH EQUALITY.

SOME RESOLUTION TWENTY SEVEN BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER WAS VERY WELL TO TURN ASSYRIAN ANGRY GENOCIDE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER NECESSARY IN. ASSEMBLY MEMBER ERICA THAT YOUR DESK THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER. I RISE TODAY I HAVE A REASON PREVIOUS YEARS ALONG WITH MY COLLEAGUES TO PRESENT ON AJ ARE TWENTY SEVEN WHICH MEMORIALIZES THE HUNDRED AND SEVENTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE A COMMEMORATIVE COMMEMORATIVE ANNIVERSARY OF THE ARMENIAN ASSYRIAN AND GREEK GENOCIDE. CALLING JUST A FEW YEARS AGO- EVEN THOUGH THIRTY FIVE NATIONS HAVE- THE COLLEGE THE GENOCIDE AND HAVE CONTRIBUTED IN MANY WAYS TO ENSURE THAT THE TRIAL SEEM ATROCITIES DO NOT HAPPEN AGAIN AND FURTHER EDUCATION ON THE ISSUE. OUR OWN VERY UNITED STATES UP UNTIL LAST YEAR HAD NOT RECOGNIZED THIS AS A THE INCIDENTS WHAT HAPPENED ARMENIANS ASSYRIANS AND GREEKS AS A GENOCIDE. AND TO THE ROOT OF THE WORD ITSELF GENOCIDE ITSELF WAS COINED A TERM IN ORDER TO DEMONSTRATE BASED ON THE TWO LATIN WORDS WHAT IT MEANS TO ACTUALLY TRY TO ERADICATE THE WHOLE NATION OR A TRIBE OF PEOPLE. BECAUSE IT'S GENERAL C. THE GETTING RID OF THE WHOLE NEED PEOPLE GROUP OF PEOPLE- AND THIS WORD ITSELF APPROPRIATELY WAS COINED BY RAPHAEL LEMKIN WHO WHOSE FAMILY. AT HE HIMSELF HAD SUFFERED AT THE ATROCITIES OF HITLER AND SO HE- HAD COINED THIS TERM GIVEN THE STUDIES HE HAD CONDUCTED TED COME TO A CONCLUSION OF WHAT. GENOCIDE MEANS AND WHAT IT MEANS TO ERADICATE A WHOLE GROUP OF PEOPLE BASED ON EITHER. THE COLOR OF THEIR SKIN THEIR RELIGION WHO THEY ARE OR WHAT CULTURES THEY COME FROM. COLLEAGUES LAST YEAR PRESIDENT BIDEN BECAME THE FIRST PRESIDENT THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE AS A GENOCIDE. BEFORE AN OCCURRENCE THAT CLAIMED THE LIVES OF THREE MILLION VICTIMS. INCLUDING THE SYRIANS GREEKS AND OTHER MINORITY GROUPS. IT'S TAKEN US OVER A HUNDRED YEARS TO GIVE THIS TO WAIT. BUT EVEN THEN IT COMES WITH THE DENIAL BY THE PERPETRATORS THEMSELVES. AND WE COULDN'T SEE THIS MORE CLEARLY THAN WHAT HAPPENED TWO YEARS AGO OF ARMENIA AZERBAIJAN FUELED BY OF ITS OIL WEALTH. TO THE WEST TURKEY REPUBLIC OF TURKEY. CONTINUE TO CARRY OUT YET ANOTHER ATROCIOUS ATTACK WHILE THE WORLD WAS IN THE SLUMBER OF THE GLOBAL PANDEMIC. AND WHEN OUR COUNTRY HAD A PRESIDENT THAT. MAYBE THEY FELT COULD TURN A BLIND EYE. OF DURING THESE ONGOING AND SO UNFORTUNATELY. BECAUSE THE GENOCIDE ITSELF WAS NOT. UNEQUIVOCALLY STATED AND SPOKEN ABOUT BY THE UNITED STATES. WE SAW A HUNDRED YEARS LATER OVER A HUNDRED YEARS LATER THEIR BE ANOTHER ATTACK ON THE SMALL COUNTRY OF ARMENIA AS AS THOUGH TO ERADICATE THE REMAINING VESTIGES THAT WEREN'T GOTTEN RID OF BEFORE AND THIS HAPPENED BEFORE ALL OF US. SO EVEN WITH MODERN TECHNOLOGY EVEN WITH. THE AMPLE INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE EVEN WITH THE CLICK OF A BUTTON HOW QUICKLY INFORMATION GETS DISSEMINATED. IT'S HARD TO. I THINK THAT SOMETHING LIKE THIS COULD HAPPEN WHEN WE KNOW SO MUCH ABOUT IT. BUT IT DID. IT HAPPENED RIGHT BEFORE US. AND THAT IN ITSELF IS THE REASON WHY WE NEED TO ALWAYS REMEMBER ALWAYS SPEAK OUT ALWAYS EDUCATE AND ALWAYS TELL OUR CHILDREN. WHAT DEBT AND THAT INCIDENT MEANS BECAUSE OF THREE GENERATIONS REMOVED. I'M STILL IMPACTED BY IT. I RAN FOR OFFICE AND GOT INVOLVED IN POLITICS BECAUSE OF THE DEEP. DEEPLY HELD SENSE OF INJUSTICE THAT'S OCCURRED I KNOW MANY OF US. BRING THAT RICHNESS OF THAT IMPACT WITH ALL OF US WHETHER YOU'RE FROM CENTRAL AMERICA WHETHER YOU'RE AFRICAN AMERICAN WHETHER YOU'RE JEWISH DOESN'T MATTER WHETHER YOU'RE IRISH YOU HAVE BEEN LEAD HERE BECAUSE OF A CERTAIN SENSE OF OBLIGATION BURDEN BY THE HISTORY OF YOUR PEOPLE. AND YOU WANNA FIX THAT. YOU WANT TO CORRECT SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN WRONG CONTINUES TO BE WRONG. SO FIRST AND FOREMOST IT'S BEEN AN HONOR TO BE WORKING WITH MANY OF YOU OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST NOW ALMOST AT THE END BY THE END OF THE YEAR. THIS DECADE. TO BRING THIS ISSUE FORWARD. I LOOK FORWARD TO THIS LEGISLATURE TO CONTINUE TO. SPEAK ON THIS ISSUE. REGARDLESS OF WHO'S STANDING HERE BECAUSE IF WE KNOW EACH OTHER'S PLIGHT IF OUR ALL OF OUR COMMON DENOMINATOR IS THE TRAUMA. THAT MAKES US BETTER AS INDIVIDUALS AND MAKES OUR SOCIETY THAT WE GOVERN BETTER. THEN IT IS IRRELEVANT WHO IT IMPACTED. ALL IT MAY IS THAT HUMANITY WAS SET ASIDE. THEY KNOW THAT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE. AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT'S NEVER ACCEPTED BY ANY OF US BECAUSE IF IT IS. THEN WE'RE DOOMED TO CONTINUE REPEATING IT. THANK YOU THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRIEDMAN YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER I RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THE G. R. TWENTY SEVEN I WANT TO FIRST OF ALL I THANK THE MEMBER FROM THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY FOR BEING A LEADER IN THIS ISSUE FOR MANY MANY YEARS AND FOR HIS WORK ON THIS RESOLUTION. I WANT TO TELL YOU ALL AS A THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE LARGEST COMMUNITY OF DIASPORA ARMENIANS- IN THE WORLD HOW IMPORTANT THIS RESOLUTION IS FOR MY COMMUNITY- EVERY YEAR THE ENTIRE CITY OF GLENDALE AND IN FACT THE REGION COMES TOGETHER LIKE AT NO OTHER TIME. ON APRIL TWENTY FIFTH THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS IMPORTANT TO ALL THE RESIDENTS OF MY CITY WHETHER THEY'RE OF ARMENIAN DESCENT OR NOT AND I HAVE TO SAY THAT THE GENOCIDE RECOGNITION THAT OUR CITY HOLDS EVERY YEAR HAS DONE SO MUCH TO EDUCATE THE COMMUNITY ABOUT THE TRAUMA. AND ABOUT THE- THE HISTORY OF OUR COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND I FEEL THAT BRINGING RESOLUTION TO THE CAPITAL EVERY YEAR HAS DONE THE SAME THING. ROSS THE STATE OF. AND THAT IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS A COMMUNITY THAT STILL FEELS THAT TRAUMA TODAY AND NOT JUST BECAUSE OF HAVING LOST FAMILY MEMBERS AND ANCESTORS AND NOT JUST BECAUSE THE WOUNDS THAT THEY HOLD PSYCHICALLY COULD NEVER CLOSE UNTIL THERE'S FULL WORLDWIDE RECOGNITION THAT THOSE EVENTS WERE INDEED A GENOCIDE BUT ALSO BECAUSE OF THE MORE RECENT EVENTS REFERENCED BY MY COLLEAGUE. OF THE INVASION OF ARMENIA. AND ARTSAKH BY ITS NEIGHBORS AND THE CONTINUED AGGRESSION THE CONTINUED VIOLENCE AND BLOODSHED. THE COMMUNITY FEELS THAT THE GENOCIDE THAT BEGAN IN. NINETEEN FIFTEEN. PEOPLE WHO HAVE NEVER TRULY WASHED THE ARMENIAN BLOOD OFF THEIR HANDS AT THOSE SAME PEOPLE ARE CONTINUING ACTS OF AGGRESSION MEANT. TO WIPE ARMENIA OFF THE MAP. AND I WILL SAY THAT IT'S MY HOPE THAT AS CALIFORNIA WE RAISE OUR VOICES TO SAY THAT WE WILL NOT ON OUR WATCH ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN. WITH THAT I URGE AN AYE VOTE TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRIEDMAN ASSEMBLY MEMBER VOEPEL YOU ARE RECOGNIZED AT YOUR DESK- YOU GO MADAM SPEAKER ASSEMBLY MEMBERS BROTHERS AND SISTERS OF COURSE I SUPPORT A. J. R. TWENTY SEVEN WITH MY VERY GOOD FRIEND. NOW I HAVE A LITTLE DIFFERENT TAKE ON THIS OF COURSE ARMENIANS IN. NINETEEN FIFTEEN SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN.

QUIET SLAUGHTER KNOW WHAT I MEAN BY QUIET SLAUGHTER IS IF YOU WANNA PERPETRATE REAL GOOD GENOCIDE YOU CUT OFF THEIR FOOD SUPPLY. GENOCIDE TODAY IS STARVATION. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER.

DOROTHY WAS JUST A LITTLE GIRL IN THE EARLY TWENTIETH CENTURY LIVING IN ARMENIA WHEN SHE HEARD A KNOCK AT THE DOOR. HER PARENTS WERE TOLD TO PACK UP THEIR BELONGINGS AND TO TAKE ONLY WHAT THEY COULD CARRY. THERE ARE BEING RELOCATED BY THE OTTOMAN TURKS AT THE START OF WORLD WAR ONE. THEIR JOURNEY WAS HORRIFIC. ONE DAY DURING THE MARCH OF THE RELOCATION ALL OF THE MEN INCLUDING DOROTHY'S FATHER WERE TOLD TO START DIGGING AT THE BASE OF THE HILL. LITTLE DID THEY KNOW. THAT THEY WERE DIGGING THEIR OWN GRAVES. THAT DAY THE MAN AND DOROTHY'S CARAVAN WERE SHOT. DOROTHY NEVER SAW HER FATHER AGAIN. THE WOMEN AND CHILDREN CONTINUED ON THE JOURNEY WITNESSING MANY ATROCITIES AND DURING UNSPEAKABLE HARDSHIPS. RACKERS FLEE THROUGH THE EFFORTS OF A RIGHTEOUS AND MORAL TURK DOROTHY HER SIBLINGS AND HER MOTHER ESCAPED BEING PART OF ONE AND A HALF MILLION ARMENIANS WHO LOST THEIR LIVES IN THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE IN NINETEEN FIFTEEN. AT OF DEVASTATION A MASSACRE MASSACRE CAME FREEDOM IN A NEW COUNTRY A NEW LAND A PLACE TO WORSHIP AND BE FREE WERE DOROTHY ARRIVED TO ELLIS ISLAND IN NINETEEN TWENTY WITH HER MY MOTHER AND YOUNGEST BROTHER BY HER SIDE. IN NINETEEN TWENTY SEVEN THE FAMILY HER OLDER AND HER OLDER BROTHERS JOINING THEM AND THE FAMILY WAS REUNITED IN AMERICA. THE COUNTRY THE OFFERED THEM FREEDOM AND NOW BECAME THEIR HOME. I AM HONORED TO SHARE THE BILLION FAMILY STORY WHICH IS ALSO THE STORY OF MY FRIEND AND SCHEDULER CRISTINA PAXTON. TODAY WE RECOGNIZE ONE POINT FIVE MILLION ARMENIANS WHO WERE SLAUGHTERED DURING WORLD WAR TWO. I AM PROUD THAT MY DISTRICT IS HOME TO MANY ARMENIANS THEY ARE RESILIENT AND STRONG PEOPLE WHO CONTRIBUTE TO OUR CULTURE AND OUR ECONOMY. AND THEIR STRONG THROUGH THEIR STRONG WORK ETHIC.
