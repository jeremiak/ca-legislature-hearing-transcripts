HEARING. WE DON'T CURRENTLY HAVE A QUORUM SO WE'LL WAIT -- TO TO CALL THE ROLL. OUR FIRST STEP -- I BELIEVE IS SENATOR SCANNER -- TO ASK HER TO COME TO COMMITTEE SO WE COULD HEAR HER BILL. WELL HOLD WHILE WE WAIT FOR HER OKAY. CENTER SCANNER WELCOME. WE DON'T CURRENTLY HAVE A QUORUM SOUL. BEGAN AS A COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE AND I WELCOME YOU TO PRESENT YOUR BILL SB. ONE FORTY THREE THANK YOU SO MUCH YES BE ONE FORTY THREE BASICALLY RECOGNIZES THAT -- WE FORTUNATELY STILL HAVE A ROBUST MARKET FOR METALS RECYCLING BUT AS A RESULT OF HAVING A ROBUST. MARKET FOR METALS RECYCLING WE CAN ALSO HAVE -- METAL THEFT SO TO HELP REDUCE METAL THEFT. THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW. OUR TIME MIDDLE RECYCLERS TO BE ABLE TO PAY. THE PERSON WHO COMES IN WITH THE SCRAP METAL. WITH EITHER CASH [inaudible] FOR WITH A QUIT GOING TO A DEBIT CARD. AND RIGHT NOW -- THAT'S NOT ALLOWED WHICH IS WHY WE NEED TO DO THIS BY STATUTORY ANNE'S PREPAID CARDS CAN HELP PREVENT METAL THEFT AND ALSO CHECK FRAUD I'M. I'M GONNA STOP THERE I CAN GO INTO MORE DETAIL MY CLOTHES PHENOMENA ALLOW OUR MY WITNESSES TO GO INTO DETAIL. SO GET YOUR ONE STOP FOR ALL RIGHT I GOT IT RIGHT HI THANK YOU CHAIRMAN EMBERS RYAN FLANAGAN HERE ON BEHALF OF THE WEST COAST CHAPTER. OF THE INSTITUTE'S RAP RECYCLING INDUSTRIES -- AND WERE SPONSOR OF THE BILL. WHERE TRADE ASSOCIATION REPRESENTING APPROXIMATELY EIGHTEEN HUNDRED COMPANIES NATIONWIDE HUNDRED OF WHICH IN CALIFORNIA? ITS MEMBERS ARE EXPERTS IN THE HANDLING PROCESSING SHIPPING AND RECYCLING OF RECYCLE SCRAP COMMODITIES. UNDER CURRENT LAW WHEN RECYCLING COMPANY PURCHASES PURCHASES NON FERROUS MATERIALS FROM A SELLER THE COMPANY MUST A LATE PAYMENT FOR THAT MATERIAL FOR THREE DAYS. UNLESS THE COMPANY HAS AN EXISTING BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP WITH THE SELLERS SET FORTH MARK. IN OTHER WORDS THE COMPANY MUST BE FAMILIAR WITH THE SELLER THE INTENT OF THE LAWS TO CURB METAL THEFT. THE THREE DAY PERIOD ALLOWS THE COMPANY AND LAW ENFORCEMENT ENOUGH TIME TO DETERMINE IF THE SALE LEGITIMATE AND IS NOT INVOLVED STOLEN MATERIAL. WE BELIEVE THIS BILL MAKE SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS TO CURRENT LAW AS TO HOW PAYMENT CAN BE MADE UNDER THE THREE DAY SCENARIO. CURRENTLY PAYMENT CAN ONLY BE MADE BY CASH OR CHECK. THIS BILL WOULD ADD ONE OTHER PAYMENT OPTION WOULD BE THE ISSUANCE OF A PREPAID BANK CARD LIKE AN ATM CARD. HOWEVER THE MONEY COULD NOT BE DRAWN FROM THE CARD FOR THREE DAY PERIOD IN ORDER TO COMPLY WITH CURRENT LAW. SOME OF THE VENICE BENEFITS OF THIS BILL WOULD BE AS FOLLOWS -- WE FEEL MODERNIZES THE CURRENT SYSTEM HELPS A NEW CONCERNS OF CHECK FRAUD. MANY OF OUR CUSTOMERS NOT BANK ACCOUNTS AND THIS ALLOWS THEM ACCESS TO THE MONEY WITHOUT PAYING A LARGE CHECK CASHING FEES. ALLOWS THEM TO LEAVE THE FACILITY WITHOUT LARGE QUANTITIES OF CASH -- AND JUST OVERALL THIS BILL IMPROVES CURRENT LAW AND HELPS CURB METAL THEFT FOR THESE REASONS RESPECTFULLY ASK DR OUT THANKS. GREAT THANK YOU RIGHT. BEFORE YOUR SECOND WITNESS -- TESTIFIES CENTERS HERE LET ME ESTABLISH A QUORUM OF THE COMMITTEE THAT'S OKAY.

THANK YOU SENATOR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY CARROLLTON A WITH THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY AS YOU KNOW MANY OF OUR LOW INCOME CLIENTS -- DO COLLECTED METALS CANS THINGS LIKE THAT TO SUPPLEMENT THEIR INCOME -- IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT SOURCE OF INCOME ESPECIALLY I THINK FOR SINGLE INDIVIDUALS. PERSON TO MAYBE ON SSI ANOTHER KIND OF PROGRAMS LIKE THAT. WE'RE SUPPORTIVE OF THIS BILL TODAY I THINK IN PARTICULAR WHAT WE LIKE ABOUT IT IS THAT THERE'S NO FEES BEING ATTACHED TO THESE DEBIT CARDS. SO -- PEOPLE CAN ARE ABLE TO USE THEM THEY CAN THEY DON'T HAVE TO HAVE IS THE OTHER WITNESS MENTION THEY DON'T HAVE TO PAY CHECK CASHING FEES THEY GET THE FULL BENEFIT OF THEIR LABOR. AND ARE ABLE TO USE IT TO PAY THE RENT AND TO BUY FOOD AND DO ALL THE OTHER THINGS -- THE REQUIRED BY THE NECESSITIES OF LIFE SO WE ARE IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL THANK YOU THANK YOU MR HERALD MISTER FLANAGAN ARE THERE OTHER WITNESSES IN FAVOR. YOUR OTHER MEMBERS PAUL YOU'RE ON BEHALF OF SCHNITZER STEEL -- WE USE THESE CARDS AND SOME OTHER STATES 50% OF THE PEDDLERS ACTUALLY PREFERRED THIS CARD -- SORE HELPING AN INDUSTRY WERE HELPING INDIVIDUALS TO MAKE THEIR LIVINGS OFF IT I WOULD -- DR -- TODAY THANK YOU GREAT ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ALL RIGHT VERY GOOD ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION PLEASE COME FORWARD. ALL RIGHT SEE NOW WILL BRING THE ISSUE BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS COMMENTS CENTER LEVER. I HAVE A QUESTION OF A COMMENT I THINK THIS IS A GREAT BILL THANK YOU SENATOR SKINNER -- ANY WAY THAT WE CAN HELP FOLKS WHO ARE DOING THIS WORK WILL ACCESS THEIR MONEY AND NOT HAVE TO PAY FEES. I THINK IS REALLY IMPORTANT. NOW WE DO KNOW THAT AS WAS STATED SO MANY FOLKS -- THAT COLLECT THESE METALS THESE CANS AND WHATNOT ARE POSSIBLY UNBANKED AND SO THEY WOULD ACTUALLY HAVE A HARD TIME CASHING A CHECK IF THEY HAVE A DEBIT TYPE CARD JUST I JUST THINK IT'S A GREAT IDEA THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. VERY ELSE CENTER ARCHULETA YES THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION -- IN AND I TO CONCEIVE -- THIS IS A GREAT IDEA MY ONLY QUESTION IS DOES IT TAKE THREE DAYS FOR THE CARD TO BE ACTIVE. BECAUSE BECAUSE I KNOW IF YOU WRITE A CHECK OR WE CAN USE TO CATCH IT MIGHT BUT IS IT IS IT NECESSARY FOR THOSE THREE DAYS. IT'S NECESSARY FOR THREE DAYS. IT'S NECESSARY THAT IT TAKES THREE DAYS BECAUSE OUR CURRENT LAW. DELAYS THE ABILITY FOR THE SCHOOL THE BUYER OF THE SCRAP METAL TO PAY THE SELLER. FOR THREE DAYS SO WE CAN REDUCE METAL THEFT S THAT'S ALREADY IN STATUTE. AND WHAT THIS DOES IS AVOID THE CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE LIKE IF YOU'RE BEING PAID IN CASH THAT YOU WOULD HAVE TO RETURN TO THE FACILITY TO PICK UP. YOUR CASH THAT YOU'RE OWED SO THAT'S THE BET ANOTHER BENEFIT OF THIS. GOOD THANK YOU SO MUCH VERY GOOD CENTERS GUNNER I THINK THIS BILL ALSO STRIKES THE RIGHT BALANCE HAPPY TO SUPPORT IT TODAY IN THE LIKE TO SAY IN CLOSING -- THE ONLY THING I DAD AS I KNOW -- THE THERE WAS SOME CONCERN THAT THIS MIGHT IMPOSE THIS MIGHT TELL BANKS THAT THEY CAN'T -- PUT V. THIS DOES NOT REGULATE OUR BANKS THIS IS PURELY THE THE ISSUE AROUND FEES IS. THAT THE METAL RECYCLER WOULD HAVE A CONTRACT WITH SOME ENTITY THAT PROVIDES THE DEBIT CARD IN IN THEIR CONTRACT THERE WOULD NOT BE A FEE ON THE USER OF THE CART. THAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR VISITING THE ELEMENT RECOGNIZE CENTER LAID HIS MOTION -- TO APPROVE THE BILL TO PASS. TO AS A TO FLOOR TO PASS THE FLOOR SECRETARY CALL THE ROLL. LASER EYE.

A BILL ENJOYS FIVE VOTES WERE GONNA HOLD THE ROLE OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK. OKAY NEXT UP SENATOR MCGUIRE SP. ONE EIGHTY FIVE YEAH IF YOU'RE A MEMBER [inaudible] RIGHT. WHY ARE WELCOME? EIGHT OF WE HAD A NICE WEEKEND START YOUR DAY OFF THAT THE ANTI WHAT A GREAT WAY TO BEGIN THE WEEK TAKE TO THE YES. BETTER BELIEVE IT. MISTER CHAIR IS THANK YOU SO MUCH AND I DID IT WAS IT WAS PRETTY GOOD WEEKEND A LITTLE BIT OF UP AND DOWN THE COAST BUT WANT TO SAY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- IT TO YOU IN YOUR VERY CAPABLE STAFF TEAM FOR OTHER WORK AND SP. ONE EIGHTY FIVE A BOTTOM LINE THIS LEGISLATION IS A TRUTH IN LABELING TRANSPARENCY BILL THAT CLOSES A LOOPHOLE THAT IS CURRENTLY IN LAW THAT ALLOWS FOR COMPANIES USING NAMES AND APPELLATIONS -- IN PRODUCTS IN ADVERTISING IT ALSO FURTHER CLARIFIES THE ORGANIC CERTIFICATION PROGRAM FOR CANNABIS IN CANNABIS PRODUCTS. CURRENTLY IT IS ILLEGAL FOR CANVAS PRODUCTS TO USE THE NAME OF A CALIFORNIA COUNTY IN THE PRODUCT'S LABELING MARKETING OR PACKAGING. IF THE CANNABIS WAS NOT GROWN IN THAT COUNTY FORTUNE. BUT THERE IS A LOOPHOLE UNDER MY KERR SAID THE MATTER MEDICINAL SIDE THAT ALLOWS FOR THE LABELING OF CANNABIS PRODUCTS IN MS MISREPRESENT THE NAME OF APPELLATIONS. WE RECENTLY SAW THIS FROM A SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA -- MANUFACTURER WHO WAS MANUFACTURING EMERALD TRIANGLE CANNABIS THAT RAT WAS ACTUALLY GROWN IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA -- IN IF THERE WAS AN APPELLATION LAW IN WILL TRAIN GOAL IS UP -- ON THE NORTH COAST THIS CAN MAKE CONSUMERS THINK WHAT THE PRODUCT OF PURCHASING IS GROWN IN A SPECIFIC REGION. BUT CAN'T REALLY IT'S NOT -- IN IT EXPANDS THE PROHIBITIONS RT STATUTE ON IMPROPERLY USING COUNTY NAMES FOR CANVAS PRODUCTS TO INCLUDE ANY SIMILAR SOUNDING NAMES AND APPELLATIONS IS LIKELY TO MISREPRESENT THE ORIGIN OF THE PRODUCT. NOW WE MODEL THESE APPELLATION OF LAWS. VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT WE ALREADY HAVE WITH WINE ON AND THOSE LAWS HAVE ALREADY BEEN IN PLACE FOR MANY DECADES HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL IT IS PROMOTED CORPORATE ACCOUNTABILITY IN CLARITY FOR CONSUMERS CANDIDLY WILL LIFT IN WHAT WE HAVE WITH WINE NOW AND PUTTING IT TOWARDS CANVAS VERY SIMILAR CHALLENGES. THE BILL ALSO ACCOMPLISHES THE SAME THING FOR CANNABIS IT ALSO CLOSES THE AMBIGUITY INSURERS TRANSPARENCY FOR CUSTOMERS VIA LABELING. FINALLY MISTER CHAIR IT CLARIFIES YOUR ORGANIC CERTIFICATION PROCESS FOR CANNABIS IN MANUFACTURED CANNABIS PRODUCTS. IN EMPOWERS INDUSTRY TO CERTIFY THEIR PRODUCTS AS ORGANIC UNDER THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH ONCE THE DEPARTMENT'S COMPLETE THEIR REGULATIONS IN. TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND THAT WAS ALSO IN THE MEDICINAL SIDE WITH THAT -- MISTER CHAIR -- I'M GONNA TURN IT OVER TERROR CARVER FROM THE HUMBLE COUNTY GROWERS ASSOCIATION GENE HERS REPRESENTING RURAL COUNTIES AS WELL. VERY GOOD. THANK YOU SENATOR MCGUIRE A GOOD AFTERNOON COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS TO CORRECT HER CARVER AND I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE HUMBLE COUNTY GROWERS ALLIANCE WE ARE A TRADE ASSOCIATION REPRESENTING WELL OVER TWO HUNDRED LEGAL CANNABIS BUSINESSES. IN HUMBOLDT COUNTY. WHILE THE WORD GROWER IS IN OUR NAME WE REPRESENT THE ENTIRE SUPPLY CHAIN INCLUDING MANY MANUFACTURERS AND OTHER CANNABIS RELATED BUSINESSES. WE CHOSE TO USE THE WORD GROWER INSTEAD OF CANNABIS BECAUSE WHEN WE INCORPORATED WE WERE UNSURE IF WE WOULD BE ABLE TO GET A BANK ACCOUNT. EVEN THOUGH WE ARE TRADE ORGANIZATION WE DON'T TOUCH THE CANNABIS PRODUCT IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM. I BRING THIS UP TODAY TO HIGHLIGHT THE REAL HURDLES THAT THIS INDUSTRY FACES DUE TO FEDERAL PROHIBITION. AND HOW THESE OBSTACLES NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE CONSUMER. DUE TO FEDERAL SCHEDULING. THE CANNABIS INDUSTRY DOES NOT HAVE ACCESS TO THE NATIONAL ORGANIC PROGRAM. ONLY THROUGH THE STATE PROGRAM WILL WE BE ABLE TO CREATE COMPATIBLE STANDARDS. AND CERTIFY IN MARKET OR CALIFORNIA GROWN PRODUCTS. AS ORGANIC IN ADDITION TO THE ORGANIC PROGRAM CALIFORNIA FOR THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS HAS TAKEN THE LEAD IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF APPELLATIONS OF ORIGIN PROGRAM. FOR CANNABIS WHICH ALSO HAS A STANDARDS BASED CERTIFIED DESIGNATION. WHILE APPELLATION OF ORIGIN HAVE GLOBAL HISTORY THAT IS HUNDREDS OF YEARS OLD CALIFORNIA WILL BE ESTABLISHING THE FIRST SUCH PROGRAM FOR CANNABIS IN THE WORLD. THIS PROGRAM IS AN ESSENTIAL TOOL FOR THE REGIONAL MARKETING AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OF LEAGUE LEGACY CANVAS PRODUCING REGIONS IN CALIFORNIA SUCH AS HUMBLE COUNTY. THEY'RE STRENGTHENING THE STANDARDS BASED MARKETING PROGRAMS FOR LICENSE PRODUCERS IN CALIFORNIA AS BE ONE EIGHT FIVE IS AN ESSENTIAL STEP IN PROTECTING CONSUMERS. PROTECTING AGAINST COUNTERFEIT PRODUCTS IN THE MARKETPLACE IN SECURING CALIFORNIA'S POSITION AS A LEADER WITHIN THE EMERGING GLOBAL CANNABIS INDUSTRY. HUMBLE COUNTY AND INDEED ALL OF CALIFORNIA IS WORLD RENOWNED FOR CANNABIS FLOWER MANUFACTURED PRODUCTS. AND WE TAKE GREAT PRIDE IN OUR CRAFTSMANSHIP OF OUR WORK.

IT DOES IT'S IT'S THE WAY OF THE PLANT DOES GROW AS FAR AS WHAT YOU'RE GONNA BE TREATING IT WITH SO WHAT WE KNOW IS CONSUMER DEMAND WHETHER IT'S FOR LETTUCE TOMATOES CHERRIES OR CANNABIS. IS GROWING FOR ORGANICS -- SO CDFA WILL HAVE THEIR ORGANIC STANDARD BY. TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND WE'RE SEEING THE SAME THING IN REGARDS TO THE WAY WE GROW THIS TERRIBLE TO PARTY COMPARED EVERYTHING ELSE BUT IN TERMS OF ALSO LOCATION OF GROWTH I MEAN WHEN YOU USE AN APPELLATION THERE SO WHATEVER -- ABOLITION SO REALLY WHAT THAT IS -- PROTECTING OUR THOSE SMALL FAMILY FARMERS -- IN LONG TERM AS WHAT'S AN ARCHER LETTER WAS REFERRING TO IS THAT THIS WILL SOON BECOME A MARKETING TOOL IS WELL AND A PROTECTION -- WITH IT FOR THOSE FARMERS WHO ARE IN SPECIFIC REGIONS SO WHAT WE KNOW AND FOR EXAMPLE IN SENATOR DODD SISTER CONSIDER GLACIERS DISTRICT THERE ARE NUMEROUS APPELLATIONS ALONG WITH CINEMA COUNTY AS WELL. AND THAT THEN BECOMES A REAL MARKETING TOOL -- FOR THOSE GROWERS AND IT ALSO PROTECTS FOLKS WHO WANT TO BE ABLE TO ADD ON TO THOSE APPELLATIONS BUT SIMPLY CANNOT BECAUSE THEIR FRUIT ORDER CANNABIS IS NOT AS GOOD OF COURSE TO GROWN IN THE LIVERMORE VALLEY FOR EXAMPLE.

AND FACILITATE ACCESS TO EDUCATIONAL EXCHANGE PROGRAMS BETWEEN CALIFORNIA AND ARMENIA -- IT WOULD FACILITATE PRODUCTS BOTH IN BOTH DIRECTIONS WHICH IS VERY EXCITING FOR THE ARMENIAN COMMUNITY BOTH HERE AND IN THE CAPITAL CITY OF YEREVAN. IN TWO THOUSAND TWO SB ELEVEN SIXTY SEVEN BY THEN SENATOR JACK GOT ESTABLISHED THE FIRST ARMENIAN INTERNATIONAL TRADE INVESTMENT OFFICE -- UNFORTUNATELY THE OFFICE WAS CLOSED BY GOVERNOR SCHWARZENEGGER IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT DURING THE ECONOMIC. DOWNTURN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CALIFORNIA AND ARMENIA HAS CONTINUED TO STRENGTHEN IN THE DECADES SINCE THE ORIGINAL OFFICE CLOSED OUR MEDIA ITSELF HAS SEEN STRONG ECONOMIC GROWTH AS WELL. IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THE ARMENIAN ECONOMIC ECONOMY GREW BY SEVEN POINT 5% AND THE GROWTH IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN IS ESTIMATED TO BE FIVE POINT. RAPIDLY EXPANDED IN RECENT YEARS -- DURING MY TIME IN THE SENATE I WAS PROUD TO ESTABLISH THE SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON CALIFORNIA ARMENIAN ART SOCK MUTUAL TRADE ART AND CULTURAL EXCHANGE.

VELVET REVOLUTION TOOK PLACE IN ARMENIA WHICH NOT ONLY CHANGE THE POLITICAL LANDSCAPE OF THE COUNTRY BUT ALSO THREE TWO CANAL MAKE LANDSCAPE. THE COUNTRY ADVANCED RAPIDLY INDUCED PART SHORT TIME PERIOD AND THIS VELVET REVOLUTION LEADS TO A GREATER DEGREE OF ECONOMIC FREEDOM [inaudible] TO EASIER ACCESS TO THE MARKETS. TO EQUAL COMPETITION IMPROVED TAX ADMINISTRATION. THE GOVERNMENT STRONGLY ENCOURAGES FOREIGN INVESTMENTS AND AND CALIFORNIA IS A PRIME. STATE. FOR ARMENIAN DISREGARD BECAUSE IT FEEDS OFF ITS HUGE ARMENIAN CMMUNITY AND OVER THE EXISTING STRONG BONDS. BETWEEN CALIFORNIA AND ARMENIA. AND ALSO OUR MINION -- MODES INNOVATION WHICH IS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN THIS PROCESS. ALL THESE CHANGES THAT HAPPENED IN OUR MEDIUM. BROUGHT US TO A CONCLUSION THAT THERE IS A HUGE ON TOP THE POTENTIAL. IN DEVELOPING CORRELATIONS BETWEEN THE TRADE ECONOMIC INVESTMENT RELATIONS BETWEEN ARMENIA AND CALIFORNIA. SO OVERRULED TRADE BETWEEN THE UNITED STANDS STATES AND ARMENIA ON ANNUAL BASIS. BASED ON THE FIGURES OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN IS ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR. BUT CALIFORNIA HAS A PORTION OF ONLY 17% IN THE STRAIT WHICH ANOTHER. TESTIMONY TO THE FACT THAT THERE IS A HUGE UNTAPPED POTENTIAL SO. ALSO WE CAN TALK ABOUT. VERY STRONG POSSIBILITIES. IN THE REALM OF IT AND HIGH TECH. ARMENIA IS A THE THIRD COUNTRY. ON THE TOP IN THE WORLD. THAT HAS A 7% OF ITS GDP ONLY. IN THE AREA -- FLIGHTY AND HIGH TECH [inaudible] ARMENIA. HAS VERY STRONG RELATIONS WITH SILICON VALLEY ARMENIAN COMPANIES. AND ALSO OUR MINION. EVEN IT WOULD BE INTERESTING FOR YOU TO KNOW THAT LA EX WAS AROUND FOR A LONG TIME ON THE SOFTWARE THE ENTIRE OPERATION OF THE AIRPORT RON ON THE SOFTWARE WHAT WOULD THAT WAS DEVELOPED. IN ARMENIA THERE ARE AMERICAN COMPANIES VERY MANUAL THEM. ARMED OF BASED IN CALIFORNIA BUT THEY BECAME INTERNATIONAL COMPANIES LIKE SYNOPSIS THAT THE EMPLOYEES ALMOST. EIGHT HUNDRED A SPECIALIST IN IN ARMENIA MICROSOFT IS PRESENT IN ARMENIAN VERY MANY OTHER COMPANIES. AND I CAN. TELL THAT. THERE IS A HUGE. EXCITEMENT AND GOOD WILL IN DARMIAN COMMUNITY FOR ESTABLISHMENT OVER THE CALIFORNIA ARMENIA TRADE AND INVESTMENT OFFICE AND I AM VERY MUCH CONVINCED THAT.

I DON'T SEE ANY IN THE ROOM BUT CENTER CHANG WELCOME WHICH WILL YOU GONNA PRESENT FIRST. WHEN A PERSON IS THE? SIXTY FOUR SIXTY FOUR OKAY PROCEED WHEN YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH TERROR GLAZER AND AND WASTING COLLEAGUE'S. SB SIXTY FOUR REQUIRES THAT ALL MUNICIPAL ANIMAL SHELTERS ARE SPECIFIED MICROCHIP ANY DOG OR CAT WITH CURRENT INFORMATION THAT IS EITHER ADOPTED OR PLANE BY A PET OWNER. THIS WILL ULTIMATELY SAVE THE CALIFORNIA TAX REFUNDS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF EUTHANIZED AND SHELTER DOGS AND CATS. SB SIXTY FOUR IS NEARLY IDENTICAL TO S. B. SEVEN OH TWO OF TWENTY ELEVEN THAT PASSED THROUGH WITH BIPARTISAN SUPPORT. AND IT ALSO ENJOYS BIPARTISAN SUPPORT AS CO AUTHORS -- TODAY. ACCORDING TO THE AMERICAN HUMANE SOCIETIES HERE APPROXIMATELY TEN MILLION PETS ARE LOST IN THE UNITED STATES MORE THAN SIX MILLION ANIMALS WIND UP IN THE NATION'S ANIMAL SHELTERS AND OUT OF THOSE ONE POINT FIVE MILLION ARE EUTHANIZED. AND IN CALIFORNIA ALONE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF SHELTER DOGS AND YOU AND CASSIE EUTHANIZE EVERY YEAR. A SIGNIFICANT SOURCE OF THE PROBLEM IS IDENTIFIED ANIMAL IDENTIFICATION AND THE ABILITY TO REUNITE THESE ANIMALS WITH THEIR FAMILIES. ONLY 15% -- DOGS AND 2% A CAPTAIN SHELTERS WITHOUT IDENTIFY KEY IDENTIFICATION. ARE REUNITED WITH THEIR OWNERS AND BY CONTRAST. ACCORDING TO THE JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN VETERAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATES VETERINARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION ALMOST THREE FOURTHS OF LOST. MICROCHIP. CATS AND DOGS WERE LOCATED DUE TO THE PRESENCE OF THE MICROCHIP. MADE DOGS FOUND HUNDREDS OF MILES FROM THEIR HOMES WERE YOU REUNITED WITH THEIR FAMILIES TO THE MICRO CHIPS AND OTHERS WERE FOUND YEARS AFTER THEY WERE LOST TO MICROCHIP TECHNOLOGY. AND THERE IS A VARIETY OF EXAMPLES ARE DURING THE COW FIRE THE FIRE SPREAD SO FAST THAT PEOPLE BARELY HAD TIME TO SAVE THEMSELVES LITTLE LET ALONE THEIR PETS AND AS A RESULT. OVER THE FOLLOWING WEEKS FIRST RESPONDERS CARRIED THOUSANDS OF INJURED IN THIS PLACE AND ALSO EMERGENCY VETERINARY. HOSPITALS EMERGENCY ANIMAL SHELTERS AND THE CHALLENGE WAS THEN TO REUNITE. THESE ANIMALS WITH THEIR OWNERS AND IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE LUCKY ANIMALS. WHO HAD MICROCHIPS -- OF HAD BEEN REUNITED BUT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFICULT BECAUSE WHISKERS WERE SINGED OFF YEARS PAINFULLY BURNED AT THE EDGES FOR WILLIS SHAVE FOR TREATMENT. SO BASICALLY SOME OF THEM WERE UNRECOGNIZABLE. WITH THIS BILL WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF DOGS AND CATS THAT WIND UP IN SHELTERS. OF OR OR BE EUTHANIZED. THE STATE OF RHODE ISLAND CURRENTLY HAS A VERY SIMILAR BILL GOING THROUGH THEIR LEGISLATIVE PROCESS TO REQUIRE MICHAEL CHIPPING STATE WIDE. AND WE WERE CLOS ACCOMPLISHING THIS IN TWENTY ELEVEN BUT NOW WE HAVE THE CHANCE TO SAVE TAXPAYER DOLLARS AND DOGS AND CATS LIVES. WITH THAT I WOULD LIKE TO TURN IT OVER TO MY WITNESSES HERE NICOLAS SOCKET FROM SOCIAL COMPASSION IN LEGISLATION AND TEN ALL TEAM FROM SAKS ARGUMENT ASIDE FOR PERMANENT PREVENTION OF CRUELTY TO ANIMALS -- YET FIRST WITNESS. HELLO MISTER CHAIR AN HONORABLE MEMBERS MY NAME IS NICHOLAS SACKETT DIRECTOR OF LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS FOR SOCIAL COMPASSION LEGISLATION WERE PROUD. TO SPONSOR SB A SIXTY FORMED THINKCENTRE CHANG FOR IMPORTANT LEADERSHIP ON THIS BILL. SOCIAL COMPASSION LEGISLATION WAS FOUNDED IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN WITH ONE OF THE COMPONENTS OF OUR MISSION BEING TO REDUCE. EUTHANASIA IN OUR SHELTERS. AS IT IS ETHICALLY MORALLY AND FINANCIALLY THE RIGHT THING TO DO ALTHOUGH WE HAVE MADE STRIDES WITH HER EFFORTS OVER THE YEARS ONE OF THE SOLUTIONS THAT MUST BE IMPLEMENTED STATEWIDE IS MICROCHIP BEING. HAVING A PATCHWORK OR LACK OF ORDINANCES IS NOT EFFECTIVE. AS ANIMALS ONCE ON LOOSE HAVENO BOUNDARIES A DOG OR CAT COULD BE PICKED UP IN ONE COMMUNITY AND DROPPED OFF IN ANOTHER SHELTER. ONE OF THE PRIMARY ISSUES WITH ANIMALS COMING INTO SHELTERS AS LACK OF IDENTIFICATION CALLERS FALLOFF FOR THE ANIMAL DID NOT HAVE ONE TO BEGIN WITH. THIS IS WHY AMERICA CHIP IS THE ONLY REAL SOLUTION FOR ANIMALS TO FIND THEIR WAY BACK HOME. I'M SURE MOST OF YOU HAVE SEEN IN THE PRESS ARTICLES OVER THE YEARS ABOUT ANIMALS RETURNING HOME BECAUSE OF THE MAKE MICROCHIP SCAN. THIS IS THE ONLY STORY THEY GET THEM THERE. IN THE STATE THAT STILL EUTHANIZE IS ROUGHLY HALF A MILLION PETS PER YEAR FOR THE LACK OF SPACE AND RESOURCES AND SPENDS MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF TAXPAYER MONEY ON THE ISSUE WE RESPECTFULLY ASK. FOR YOUR SUPPORT. WE GET NEXT WITNESS. THANK YOU TO THE CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS ARE I'M KENNEL TINA IN THE C. E. O. THE SACRAMENTO SPCA WE ARE THE LARGEST INDIVIDUAL PROVIDER OF HEALTH CARE FOR ANIMALS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I'M HERE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. SIMPLY BECAUSE IT SAVES LIVES WHILE REDUCING STRAINS ON OUR SHELTERS MANY OF OUR PUBLIC SHELTERS WHICH ARE ALREADY OVERWHELMED WITH ANIMALS. I REACHED OUT TO MY COLLEAGUES BOTH AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL AND AS A MEMBER OF CAL ANIMALS HERE IN CALIFORNIA. TO ASSESS THEIR THEIR RESPONSES TO COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE DONE THIS DALLAS TEXAS. TWO YEARS AGO PUT IN MANDATORY MICROCHIP PIC. THEY DID IT IN ADDITION TO ELIMINATING ALL OF THEIR LICENSING FEES SO IT WAS NOT AN ISSUE OF MONEY IT WAS AN ISSUE OF SAVING LIVES. THEY HAVE FOUND THAT RETURN THE OWNER IN THE FIELD WHICH IS WHERE AN ANIMAL CONTROL OFFICER. HAS PICKED UP IN OUR HOME AND TAKE IT DIRECTLY TO THE HOME INSTEAD OF SPENDING AN HOUR TAKING IT DOWN TO THE SHELTER. AND INTRIGUE INTO THE SYSTEM. NOW COUNTS 440% OF THEIR CALLS WHICH MEANS THAT THE REST OF THE TIME THEY CAN FOCUS ON THE ANIMALS WERE ACTUALLY IN NEED WHO POSE A SAFETY HAZARD TO THE PUBLIC WHO ARE ENDANGERING LIVES OR OTHER ANIMALS IN THE AGGRESSIVE WAY. AND IT FREES THEM UP TO FOCUS ON THE ITEMS AND NEED THE THE ANIMAL WHO. WHO GOT OUT THE FRONT DOOR THIS MORE? THIS MORNING IS NOT IN NEED OF EXPENSIVE ANIMAL CARE SERVICES AS OPPOSED TO THE ANIMAL WHO'S THREATENING OR ATTACKING OTHER ANIMALS OR PEOPLE. SAN ANTONIO AND I'LL MENTION THAT MOST MAJOR CITIES IN THE STATE OF TEXAS NOW HAVE MANDATORY MICROCHIP AND ALSO HAS FOUND THAT THEIR LIVE RELEASE RATE. AFTER MANDATORY MICROCHIP PAYING WENT FROM 77% OF ALL ANIMALS MAKING OUT ALIVE 292% OF ALL ANIMALS MAKING UP A LOT. SO IT IS NOT AN UNDERSTATEMENT TO SAY THIS SIMPLE ACT A FIVE DOLLAR CHIP. WILL NOT ONLY INCREASE THE NUMBER OF ANIMALS IN CALIFORNIA WHO MAKE IT OUT OF THE SHELTER ALIVE. IT WILL REDIRECT OUR ARE SCARCE RESOURCES AND MUNICIPAL SHELTERS TO THE ADULTS WHO ACTUALLY NEED OUR HELP AND THE COMMUNITY WHO NEEDS THE SERVICE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AGAIN ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN FAVOR PLEASE STEP UP TO THE MICROPHONE. AND IF I YOUR NAME [inaudible] ALL RIGHT. VERY GOOD ANY OUT ANYBODY HERE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. MISTER CHAIR ND MEMBERS A BIT OF A TWEENER -- MICHAEL PIMENTEL HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA AND AWHILE FOR ASSOCIATION WE HAVEN'T UNOPPOSED UNLESS AMENDED POSITION ON THE BILL -- WITHIN -- REFLECTED -- WITHIN YOUR COMMITTEE ANALYSIS -- WANT TO SAY THAT WE APPRECIATE THE CHAIR AND THE COMMITTEE STAFF OF FOUR WORKING TO ADDRESS US AND THE CONCERNS HAVE BEEN RAISED BY SHELTERS. AROUND COMPLYING WITH THIS MANDATE -- WILL CONTINUE TO WORK -- WITH YOU ALL TO MAKE SURE THAT THE ULTIMATELY SERVICE -- ITS PURPOSE OF REUNITING OWNERS WITH THEIR PETS -- WE WANT EMPHASIZE THAT UNLESS A DOCTORS ROUTINELY UPDATE -- THEIR CHIPS -- ONCE THEY TAKE A DOG OR CAT HOME CHIP HAS NO DATA WERE NOT RELEVANT DATA I WHICH MAKES THE MANDATE -- YOUR PROBLEMATIC. WE'RE NOT ABLE TO UPDATE OUR POSITION UNFORTUNATELY BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE HEARING BUT WE ARE REVIEWING THE BILL. AND CERTAINLY FOLLOW UP WITH THE AUTHOR'S OFFICE THANK YOU. VERY GOOD ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ART SCENE NOW WILL BRING THE MATTER BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR CALM THEIR QUESTIONS SENATOR DODD. YES SOMEONE IF SOMEBODY COULD SPEAK TO THAT -- LAST -- DOES MONA POLICE INTO THE UPDATING OF THE CHIP INFORMATION ON THAT'S A BIT OF AN THIS MISNOMER IN IN MY MIND I'M ALSO A MEMBER OF THE ASSOCIATION THAT MR MET PIMENTEL IS REPRESENTING TODAY. ALL CHIPS CARRY NOT ONLY INFORMATION THAT YOU PROVIDED BUT ALSO THE INFORMATION THE ORIGINATING ORGANIZATION. ONE ANIMAL THAT LEAVES MY SHELTER HERE IN SACRAMENTO IF IT'S PICKED UP OR FOUND SOMEPLACE ELSE AND THE OWNER DOES NOT RESPOND THEY CALL ME. AND THEN I CAN TAKE THE ANIMAL BACK AND WORK TO MY CHANNELS TO GET THE ON MY BACK WITH ITS OWNER. SO THE OTHER COUNTER PART OF THAT IS THE MOST LIKELY AND MOST RELEVANT INFORMATION ON THAT SHIP IS YOUR PHONE.

THANK YOU AND I THINK CENTER CHAIN FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD WELL CERTAINLY THE DATABASE MAY NOT BE PERFECT AT CERTAINLY BRIDE MUCH MORE INFORMATION THAN. HAVING NO INFORMATION AT ALL SO I THINK -- HOPEFULLY THAT WILL BREAK I WOULD MAKE NOTE THAT THE ANALYSIS INDICATES THAT -- BEING -- THAT ANIMAL BEING -- INTERACT WITH THE CHIP IS -- SIMILAR -- TO TO RECEIVING A ADMINISTERING A VACCINE THAT WOULD MAKE NOTE THAT -- AS VACCINES DON'T CAUSE AUTISM. OF THE LDP CHIP CAUSES AUTISM -- LEAVE IT TO THE VETERINARIAN TO SEE WHETHER A CHILD CAN GET OUT THAT IT WHETHER A A AT A PET CAN GET AUTISM OR NOT. BUT I WOULD BE HAPPY TO MOVE THE BILL.

DO YOU HAVE WITNESSES COMING UP. THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH AGAIN -- MISTER CHAIRMAN AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS. I WOULD PRESENT HUGH SP TWO FORTY FIVE THIS BILL WOULD WAIVE ADOPTION FEES AT LOCAL PUBLIC AB ANIMAL SHELTE FOR MILITARY VETERANS. MANY OF WHOM SEEK EMOTIONAL SUPPORT ANIMAL COMPANIONS TO THE PUBLIC SHELTER SYSTEM. CALIFORNIA IS HOME TO APPROXIMATELY TWO MILLION VETERANS SOME OF WHOM ARE COPING WITH PTSD OR OTHER SERVICE RELATED. MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS RECENT STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT VETERANS WITH PTSD AND AN ANIMAL COMPANION HAD LOWER DEPRESSION. A BETTER ABILITY TO COPE WITH THEIR SITUATION. LOWER LEVELS OF SOCIAL ISOLATION AND AN OVERALL GREATER SATISFACTION WITH LIFE REDUCING THE VARIOUS ADOPTING AN ANIMAL FROM A LOCAL SHELTER FOR THE PURPOSES OF EMOTIONAL SUPPORT WOULD BE AN IMPORTANT STEP. IN HELPING OUR VETERANS HEAL FROM THE WOUNDS WE CANNOT SEE. IN FACT -- LORRAINE SEE ON WHO WE SHOT TO MY OFFICE WANTING TO SPEAK WITH ME BECAUSE OF THE BILL SHE HAD GOTTEN WORD OF THE BILL. HE IS A US ARMY VETERAN WHO SERVED SIX YEARS IN IRAQ. AND AFTER RETURNING HOME SHE HAD PTSD AND SHE SOUGHT THE COMFORT AND COMPANIONSHIP OF AN EMOTIONAL SUPPORT ANIMAL IN FACT WAS SUGGESTED BY SISTER. ACTUALLY THREE CONSIDERATE SHE DIDN'T THINK IT WOULD HELP HER. SHE TOLD ME MADE SUCH IT WAS MADE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT WERE ALLOWED HER TO GO BACK TO WORK HE NOW WORKS FOR A HOMELESS. PROGRAM AND SHE SAID SHE HAD TO BORROW MONEY FROM A FAMILY MEMBER TO PAY FOR HER. A NEW PET SO SHE CAME TO MY OFFICE TO THANK ME FOR A CARING THIS BILL. COLE YOU MENTIONED A LOT OF VETERANS DON'T HAVE THAT OPTION SO THIS BILL OPENS THE DOOR FOR SO MANY OF OUR VETERANS SEEKING COMPANIONSHIP.

SOON FOR EXACT STATE THAT'S FANTASTIC. THANK YOU. YOUR NEXT WITNESS SENATOR. MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS ALEX TORRES ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF VETERANS SERVICE AGENCIES WERE VERY HAPPY TO EXPRESS OUR SUPPORT FOR SP. TWO FORTY FIVE FOUNDED IN NINETEEN NINETY FIVE THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF VETERANS SERVICE AGENCIES IS A CONSORTIUM OF SEVEN NON PROFIT VETERANS SERVICE PROVIDERS WORKING IN PARTNERSHIP TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF CALIFORNIA'S VETERANS. I CAP THIS MISSION IS TO ADDRESS AND PROMOTE THE EMPLOYMENT TRAINING EDUCATION HOUSING MEDICAL AND BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT NEEDS OF VETERANS AND THEIR FAMILIES -- AS YOU HEARD HAD ADOPTING A PET CAN GREATLY HELP VETERANS WITH POST TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER GET RELIEF FROM THEIR SYMPTOMS. A REVIEW OF THE SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE REVEALS A FIRM AND GROWING EVIDENCE BASE THAT PETS ARE VERY EFFECTIVE INTERVENTIONS FOR VETERANS WITH PTSD WITH MANY STUDIES SHOWING THAT PETS CONFER A RANGE OF BENEFITS ON FUNCTIONING AND MENTAL HEALTH. IN A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL OF VETERANS SELECTED IN THE UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HEALTH SCIENCE CENTER STUDY IN SAN ANTONIO. THOSE WHO ADOPTED A DOG FROM A LOCAL PET SHELTER HAD SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER RELIEF FROM DEPRESSION AND LONELINESS THAN THOSE PUT ON A THREE MONTH WAIT LIST WHO WERE THE CONTROL POPULATION FROM THE STUDY. THIS BILL IS LIMITED TO VETERANS WITH DMV I ID DESIGNATIONS AND GIVEN THE ISSUANCE OF ABOUT SEVENTY THOUSAND OF THOSE TO DATE -- WE FIELDS PRAGMATICALLY CRAFTED TO REDUCE ANY DISPROPORTIONATE FISCAL BURDEN -- AS MR -- IN IN MISTER BUT HAVE EXPLAINED -- THE SUPPORT PROVIDED THESE VETS IS IMMEASURABLE AND CAN WORK TO HELP MITIGATE THE DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES ASSOCIATED WITH PTSD. WE THINK THE STATS THE SENATOR AND HER STAFF FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS IMPORTANT BILL STRONGLY URGE AND I FELT THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHER WITNESSES AND SUPPORT YOU COULD COME FORWARD. ALL RIGHT ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. RESEARCHER MEMBERS MICHAEL FROM TELL AGAIN WITH THE CALIFORNIA ANIMAL WELFARE ASSOCIATION WE DON'T HAPPEN OPPOSE POSITION ON THIS BILL RATHER WERE RAISING SOME CONCERNS. WE THINK THAT THE GOAL THE BILLS ULTIMATELY VERY LAUDABLE AND IT REALLY DOES RECOGNIZE IMPORTANT ROLE THAT. ANIMALS PLAY IN THE LIVES OF EVERYONE -- ONE OF THINGS WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THOUGH IS IF THE POTENTIAL OF FINANCIAL IMPACT -- TO LOCAL SHELTERS -- AND SO WE ARE -- COMING TO THE AUTHOR ON TO THIS COMMITTEE THAT WE WORK THROUGH -- FINANCING MECHANISM TO MAKE SURE THAT -- THE SHELTERS ARE MADE WHOLE I IN A MEETING THE OBJECTIVES OF THE BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. RIGHT SIGNAL BRING THE ISSUE BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR COMMON -- QUESTION CENTER LABOR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF CENTER CHANG THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD JACOB THANK YOU FOR SHARING YOUR STORY THANK YOU FOR BRINGING MISTER BUT I THINK PERSONALLY WE DON'T DO ENOUGH FOR OUR SERVICE MEN AND WOMEN SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE. AND THE FACT THAT YOU CAN'T EXPLAIN TO HIM WHY YOU'RE LEAVING WE CAN JUSTIFY IT TO OTHER HUMAN BEINGS RIGHT. BUT THE FACT THAT HE'S IN YOUR LIFE TO MAKE YOU A BETTER HUSBAND AND CONGRATULATIONS ON THE NEW CHILD HE'S GOING TO MAKE YOU A BETTER FATHER -- TO AND I AGREE WITH YOU WE ALWAYS HAD BIG DOGS WHEN I WAS GROWING UP AND ONCE YOU HAVE A LITTLE DOG THEY'RE KIND OF FUN. BECAUSE YOU CAN TAKE THEM EVERYWHERE IT'S HARD TO GET EIGHTY POUND DOG ON A PLANE NO ONE REALLY LIKES THAT. SO I THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE I THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TO TESTIFY I DO UNDERSTAND THERE'S SOME MONETARY CONCERNS BUT I THINK WE NEED TO FIGURE THAT OUT BECAUSE THIS IS THE VERY LEAST WE CAN DO FOR OUR VETERANS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. I'M GONNA GO SENATOR HILL AND THEN WE'LL GO AROUND THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TABLE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND THANK YOU FOR THE TESTIMONY AND CONGRATULATIONS ALSO IN THE GRADUATION IS WONDERFUL. THE QUESTION THE LETTER OF CONCERN AND I KNOW WHICH MENTIONED THE NUMBER BUT IN THE LETTER AND IN THE OPPOSITION. THE CONCERN THAT WAS HIGHLIGHTED. IT INDICATED TWO MILLION VETERANS IN THE STATE I GUESS THAT'S THE TOTAL NUMBER OF VETERANS THAT ARE IN THE STATE BUT YOU HAVE MENTIONED THERE'S WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE SEVENTY THOUSAND OR SO WHO ARE. THAT HAS THE BETTER INCENTIVES DESIGNATION ON THEIR DRIVER'S LIFE I SEE OKAY AND THEN. V.. TWO THAT REALLY REDUCES THE THE COST AND THERE WAS ANOTHER POLICY ISSUE THAT WAS OUTLINED IN THE THIS IS THE ANALYSIS TALKING ABOUT IS THEIR NEED FOR OTHER ANIMALS OR WE WERE TALKING ABOUT DOGS AND CATS AND IS THERE AN INTEREST IN. LIMITING IT. TO DOGS AND CATS WE ARE -- WELL BECAUSE THERE ARE SOME LIKE A RABBIT. OUR ANIMALS THAT YOU KNOW VETERANS MAY CHOOSE. TO ADOPT BUT IT'S IT'S REALLY FOR THEM TO DETERMINE WHICH EMOTIONAL SUPPORT AND MORE. AS FOR THEM UT WE'RE OPEN TO REIGNING IT IN TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S NO [inaudible] NO [inaudible] MUCH [inaudible] LARGER. ANIMALS I MEAN IF THAT'S IF THAT IF THE COMMITTEE SO CHOOSES. THANK YOU SENATOR HEALTH CENTER ARCHULETA AND THEN. SENATOR PANDA YET WELCOME TO MY FELLOW VETERANS WELCOME HOME SIMPLIFY THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE. AND I JUST LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOU A 100% BEHIND YOU THE ONLY QUESTION THAT I HAVE IS IN REFERENCE TO THE CALIFORNIA -- ID CARD THAT SAID BETTER ON IT LITTLE DIFFICULT TO GET IN FIVE MADE FOR THE FOR THE COMMITTEE. YOU'VE GOT TO GET YOUR DD TWO FOURTEEN TAKE IT OVER THE VA -- THEY VERIFY IT THEN YOU TAKE IT OVER TO THE TO THE WHERE WE GET YOUR DRIVER'S LICENSE WHATEVER THAT DMB MIGHT BE. AND THEN YOU HAVE TO WAIT FOR IT SO MY MY QUESTION IS IS THERE ANY WAY THAT YOU CAN AMEND THAT TO ADD -- THE DD TWO FOURTEEN AND OR ANY OTHER MILITARY -- SERVICE CART VFW AMERICAN LEGION -- ANYONE ABOUT SO IT'S NOT RESTRICTED ONLY TO THAT CALIFORNIA ID. WE WOULD BE OPEN BUT THE REASON WHY WE MENTIONED VETERANS ON THE DMV OR DRIVERS LICENSES TO KIND OF RAIN AND IN A LITTLE BIT BUT OBVIOUSLY WE WOULD LOVE -- O AT SOME POINT PROVIDE THIS FOR ALL THE VETERANS AND YA IN AND IF IT IF IT SHOULD CALIFORNIA VALID ID -- IDENTIFICATION -- AND OR DD TWO FOURTEEN OR OTHER -- VETERANS IDENTIFICATION CARD. PERIOD AND THAT WOULD ENCOMPASS SOME OF THE PEOPLE THAT -- JUST FIND IT TOO DIFFICULT TO GO TO DMB TOO DIFFICULT -- TO GO TO THE VA AND SO ON BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE DD TWO FOURTEEN AND A DD TWO FOURTEEN FOR THE COMMITTEE IF YOUR DISCHARGE RECORDS. SHOW OF ALL OF US SEEM TO FIND IT AT HOME A LOT EASIER AND OR KAREN YOUR MEREKA LEGION CARD. JUST TO WALK IN AND THAT'LL DO IT AND I THINK -- THE WHOLE IDEA HERE TO OPEN UP BECAUSE I KNOW WE HAVE BETTER INTO IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN BUT WE'VE GOT KOREAN WAR VETERANS OF VIETNAM VETERANS. WHO WOULD ALSO WOULD LOVE TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS THEY MAY NOT HAVE THAT SO THIS WOULD JUST OPEN IT UP AND I THINK WOULD BE MORE VETERAN FRIENDLY -- IF I CAN RECOMMEND THANK YOU CENTER ARCHULETA SENATOR PAT. I THANK YOU FIRST OF ALL I'D HAVE A TECHNICAL QUESTION IS THIS GOING TO APPROPRIATIONS. NO OKAY PATRONS GOING STRAIGHT. OKAY BUT WILL EVENTUALLY GO TO PRESENT THE FISCAL [inaudible] OKAY. RIGHT WELL I KNOW NOT SURE BECAUSE IT DOESN'T OKAY IT IS -- ALL RIGHT GUYS THAT'S QUITE ALRIGHT SO -- FIRST OF ALL -- THE FIRST ONE WOULD THINK WOULD THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE -- AND AND AND AND CERTAINLY WE WANT -- TO AS A STATE AND AS SUPPORT ALL VETERANS -- I I THINK YOU WHAT YOU'RE HEARING IN THE DISCUSSION IS A BIT OF THE TENSION HERE RIGHT SO. ON ONE HAND YOU KNOW YOU -- YOU'VE LIMITED THE BILL TO THE PEOPLE HAVE THE DRIVER'S LICENSE BUT THAT ALSO LIMITING BECAUSE THE CHALLENGES OF GETTING IT DRIVER'S LICENSE IN FACT MANY OF THE VETERANS YOU MAY WANT TO HELP. WE HAVE SOME CHALLENGES GETTING DISPOSING DRIVER'S LICENSE THERE MAY BE CERTAIN REASONS OR WHATEVER. AT THE FLIP SIDE I THINK WE HAVE SOME TENSION ABOUT. THE COST IT HAS TO THE SHELTERS -- AND AND I THINK TO BE ENTIRELY FAIR I DON'T KNOW HOW THE STATE MANDATE COMMISSION WOULD VIEW THIS AS THIS BECAME LAW. SINCE THESE ARE PUBLIC SHELTERS BUT IN MANY WAYS WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT WORSE ARE REQUIRING SOMEONE ELSE TO PROVIDE NO IT'S VERY. IMPORTANT USEFUL SERVICE FOR FREE ESSENTIALLY. AND I THINK THAT YOU KNOW I I THINK THERE'S SOME CHALLENGES THERE IN THE SENSE THAT -- AS MUCH YOU KNOW AND I AGREE WITH ALL THE TESTIMONY ABOUT THE BENEFITS AND AND CERTAINLY OUR VETERANS HAVE -- HAVE PUT THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE TO TO TO PROTECT US SO WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT WAYS TO HELP THEM -- BUT IN SOME SENSES IF WE AS A STATE ARE GONNA SAY WELL WE'RE GOING TO WAIVE THE ADOPTION FEES ETCETERA THEN WE SHOULD BE BACK FILLING IT SOMEWHERE BECAUSE THE SHELTERS -- MANY OF THEM -- THEY'RE RUNNING ON FAIRLY SHOE STRING BUDGETS THEY NEED THOSE THOSE FUNDS TO HELP YOU KNOW TAKE CARE OF THE ANIMALS THAT THEY DO HAVE THEIR UNTIL THEY CAN GET THEM ADOPTED AND SO FORTH -- SO I I THINK THERE'S A STILL A LOT OF OUTSTANDING ISSUES TO WORK OUT -- THAT WE I THINK WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT. HOW WE'RE GONNA BE SURE THIS IS ADEQUATELY FUNDED IN A WAY -- TO BE SURE THAT OUR STATE OR SHELTERS OR ARE ARE FINANCIALLY YOU KNOW. NOT GONNA BE OVER BURDENED TO THAT BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO SHELTERS CLOSING FOR THE ANIMALS WE WANT TO GET THE ANIMALS TO THE VETERANS WITH -- TOO WHO WHO WHO DESIRE THEM WITH THE MINIMUM AMOUNT OF I GUESS BURDEN RIGHT I UNDERSTAND. PLEASE INCLUDING ALL YOU KNOW IS VERY. RIGHT OKAY. AND AND AND ALL YOU KNOW THAT YOU KNOW AND AS MANY BETTORS POSSIBLE I THINK IT'S THERE ARE TO LEAD A MENTION -- SO -- SO IN THAT SENSE I A DOT B. L. I'M WILLING TO VOTE FOR THE BILL TODAY BUT I THINK THERE'S A LOT OUTSTANDING ISSUES THAT STILL NEED TO BE WORKED OUT I KNOW IT'S GOING TO ANOTHER COMMITTEE BY OCCURS THAT YOU WE TRY TO FIGURE OUT HAVE A CONVERSATION. WITH THE SHELTER TO SO WE NEED TO BE SURE TO SHELTERS ARE. ADEQUATELY SUPPORTED TOO AND I'M CONCERNED THAT WHILE THE INTENT OF THE BILL CERTAINLY IS VERY LAUDABLE AND I SUPPORT. THAT WE DON'T HAVE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES THAT BASICALLY -- MAKE ACTUALLY THAT'S LESS AVAILABLE HAVE HARMED THAT'S BECAUSE NOW SHELTERS ARE HAVING FINANCIAL DIFFICULTY AND ALSO BE SURE THAT THIS. IS AVAILABLE TO MORE VETERANS. AS WELL WHO MADE HIS WHO MAY BENEFIT FROM THIS. THANK YOU SENATOR PANTS SENATOR DODD. YEP FALLING ON DOCTOR PEONS -- JUST NOT AS MUCH COMMENTS. WELL WHAT IT WHAT IS THE COST HE AVERAGE COST OF LOOKING THROUGH. FOR FOR THIS RIGHT NOW OR WHAT IS WHAT DID YOU PAY FOR MISTER BUT ACTUALLY FOR MR BUT WE DIDN'T GET INFORMATION ALTER MY MY WIFE HAD HIS MOM IN -- THE REST OF THE LIBERAL STILL BARNES AND SO YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE TO LIVE THROUGH IT AND SO WE RAISE THEM UNTIL WE'RE GOING. TO BE ABLE TO GET. A SONG OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT BUT I GOT TO CATCH TEM IN THE OFFICE OF BONDING WITH THEM DURING THAT TIME. BUT THE AVERAGE NUMBERS ABOUT FIFTY BOXES OF HEARING HERE. IF IT RANGES ACTUALLY REALLY FIRST A FLAT FEE FOR ADOPTIONS FOR VETERANS WHICH IS A HUNDRED DOLLARS BUT BUT IT WON'T BE A BACK FLOW FROM THE STATE BECAUSE IT IS. IT IS WITH THE LOCAL SHELTERS IN LOCAL COUNTIES FOR EXAMPLE RIVERSIDE COUNTY CURLY WAVES ADOPTION FEES. OF FOR ACTIVE MILITARY MILITARY VETERANS AND I JUST DON'T SEE IT AS A HUGE -- BURDEN ON SHELTERS BECAUSE AGAIN ONE OF THE ONE OF THE ONE OF THE WAYS THAT WE'RE TRYING TO KIND OF RAIN IT IN AS A TO MAKE THIS KIND OF LIKE A A PILOT PROGRAM IS TO HAVE IT WITH THE DRIVER'S LICENSE FIRST AND SEE HOW. HOW THAT'S GOING TO GO AND I KNOW MAYBE THERE WOULD BE SOME QUESTIONS LIKE WELL WHAT IF? IT WOULD BE -- ARE USUALLY A LARGE VETERAN OF POPULATION YEAH. BUT THE VET BECAUSE THE VETERAN POPULATION IS DISTRIBUTED THROUGHOUT THE STATE THERE'S NOT IT'S NOT GONNA BE A STRAIN ON ONE SPECIFIC AREA SO. LET ME -- LET ME JUST SAY A COUPLE THINGS CENTER THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD JUDGE JACOB THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMPELLING TESTIMONY AND PERSONAL STORY ALEX THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY MISTER PENTEL THANK YOU FOR COMING TO SHARE. APPOINTED SENSITIVITY TO US AS A COMMITTEE. I THINK THE BILL IS -- IT WAS ONE I'LL SUPPORT TODAY BECAUSE IT'S A IT'S A MODEST IN SCOPE IT HAS A GREAT PURPOSE. BUT AS WITH ANY MANY THINGS WE DO HERE AT THE LEGISLATURE WE TAKE STEPS IN THIS CASE MIGHT BE SMALLER STEPPED IN. MEMBERS WOULD LIKE BUT IT'S A STEP FORWARD. AND I THINK ALL OF US WOULD LIKE TO SERVE OUR VETERANS COMMUNITY IN ANY WAY WE CAN. HI WITHIN SOME YOU KNOW FISCAL CONSTRAINTS BUT THE OTHER BEAUTY OF THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS IS THAT THOSE THAT HAVE FISCAL IMPACT CAN BE ANALYZED MORE CAREFULLY. BY OUR FISCAL COMMITTEE AT WORK POLICY COMMITTEE HERE TODAY. AND I THINK THAT I'M SURE WE'LL GET THAT KIND OF REVIEW THAT OUR MEMBERS ARE OF SHOWING SOME SENSITIVITY TO THE YEAR. AND I THINK THAT -- YOU'LL BE ABLE TO WORK WITH THEM -- TO MAKE THIS BILL BE AS GOOD AS IT CAN WITH AN AFFORDABLE RANGES AND I'M CONFIDENT THAT. AND YOUR AUTHORSHIP YOU'LL BE ABLE TO SHEPHERD THROUGH IN THAT WAY. SO I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT WHEN I GIVE YOU AN OPPORTUNITY CLOSING AND MORE. THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR FOR THE COMMITTEE'S KIND WORDS TODAY WE DO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO SOMETHING TO HELP OUR VETERANS WHO PUT THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE FOR A COUNTRY. AND IT'S QUITE MINIMAL AND WE HAVE THE CHANCE TO HELP FOR HEROES FIND SOME RELIEF AND PEACE OF MIND THROUGH COMPANIONSHIP. AND THEIR STORIES LIKE THIS ALL ACROSS THE STATE THIS IS JUST THE ONE LITTLE THING THAT WE CAN DO FOR THEM.
