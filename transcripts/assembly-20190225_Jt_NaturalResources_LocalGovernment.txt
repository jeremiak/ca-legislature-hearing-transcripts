THIS HEARING IS TITLED IMPROVING FIRE PREVENTION. IN CALIFORNIA AND WE'RE HOLDING IT IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE COMMITTEE ON NATURAL RESOURCES AND THE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE ON LOCAL GOVERNMENT CHAIRED BY CECILIA AGUIAR-CURRY. I'M LAURA FRIEDMAN SURE OF NATURAL RESOURCES AND I WANT TO WELCOME EVERYBODY WHO'S HERE TODAY. THANK YOU ALL FOR COMING IN FOR PARTICIPATING AND ALSO TO ANYBODY WHO MIGHT BE WATCHING THIS ARE LIVE STREAMING IT THANK YOU FOR YOUR INTEREST IN THIS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT SUBJECT -- AS WERE ALL WHERE WE HAVE BEEN FACING A SERIES OF DEVASTATING WILDFIRES IN CALIFORNIA -- THEY DON'T SIGN SHOW ANY SIGN OF GETTING. ANY BETTER ANY TIME SOON IN FACT THEY SEEM TO BE INCREASING IN INTENSITY AND FREQUENCY IN FREQUENCY. AND WE HAVE LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE PAST FEW YEARS AND THAT IT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR US. TO DISCUSS AND REMINDER COMMUNITIES ABOUT AND TODAY WE'RE GOING TO BE FOCUSING PARTICULARLY. ON WHAT WE CAN DO FROM A LOCAL LEVEL TO HELP INCREASE PREPAREDNESS RESILIENCY AND ALSO COORDINATION BETWEEN THE VARIOUS STATE AGENCIES -- I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUES FOR BEING HERE PARTICIPATING -- I'M GOING TO NOW TURN THE MICROPHONE OVER TO MY CO CHAIR CECILIA AGUIAR-CURRY TO MAKE ANY OPENING COMMENTS. THANK YOU EVERYONE FOR ATTENDING TODAY I LIKE TO THINK ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRIEDMAN MY CO CHAIR FOR THIS HEARING -- THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A VERY CRITICAL A TOPIC. I TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN I IN MY DISTRICT WE HAD THE SULFUR FIRE IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WE HD THE PUNNY FIRE THEM IN THE SCENE -- COMPLEX WHICH INCLUDED BOTH THE RANCH FIRE AND THE RIVER FIRE. THESE ARE THE BIGGER FIRES OF MY DISTRICT SINCE I WAS ELECTED TO STATE ASSEMBLY OVER TWO YEAR PERIOD IT'S NO LONGER A MATTER OF IF THERE'S GOING TO BE A FIGHTER IS JUST WHEN WILL THE NEXT ONE OCCUR. I FULLY BELIEVE THAT WE MUST REDOUBLE OUR EFFORTS IN SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASING FIRE PREVENTION ACTIVITIES IN OUR STATE WE MUST STRENGTHEN OUR PARTNERSHIPS WITH PRIVATE ENTITIES -- HOMEOWNERS ARE LOCALS AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENTS BECAUSE FIRE DOES NOT RESPECT PROPERTY. LINES I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO HEARING WHAT EACH PERSON HAS TO SAY TODAY -- THERE'S A LOT OF INNOVATION OUT THERE I AM -- I APPRECIATE YOU TAKING YOUR TIME FROM YOUR BUSY DAY AS WELL TO SHARE SOME OF THE NEW IDEAS THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

WHILE GOVERNOR JERRY BROWN APPOINTED -- BRUCE AS CCC DIRECTOR IN SEPTEMBER TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN HIS CAREER WITH THE COURTS GOES BACK TO NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN DURING THE CCC'S EARLIEST DAYS WELCOME TO BOTH OF YOU AND THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE WITH US TODAY. WITHOUT TURN IT OVER TO THE CHIEF THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GOOD AFTERNOON. CHAIRS FRIEDMAN IN. AGUIAR-CURRY MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. YEAH MY NAME IS MIKE RICH WINE AND I AM THE ACTING STATE FIRE MARSHAL. THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE OVERGROWN FORCED IN PROLONGED DROUGHT HAVE RESULTED IN UNPRECEDENTED TREE MORTALITY IN THE STATE'S FOREST. AS WELL AS AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER SIZE AND SEVERITY OF WILDFIRES. THE LOSS OF LIFE AND STRUCTURES AS A DIRECTOR PROXIMATE RESULT OF WILDFIRES IS AT AN ALL TIME HIGH. IN TURN CAL FIRE IS SAID ITS FOCUS UPON INCREASING THE PACE AND SCALE OF FIRE PREVENTION ACTIVITIES. AS A KEY ELEMENT IN OUR BATTLE AGAINST DESTRUCTIVE AND DEADLY WILDFIRES. WE USE THE STATE'S STRATEGIC FIRE PLAN AS A ROAD MAP. THIS PLAN WAS RECENTLY UPDATED IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN AND WAS ADOPTED BY THE BOARD OF FORESTRY. AND IT SPECIFICALLY CALLS OUT THE IMPORTANCE OF FOR FOR WORK TO REDUCE THE IMPACT AND THREADED THESE WILDFIRES HAS LONG BEEN PART OF OUR MISSION. BUT OVER THE PAST YEARS WE HAVE DOUBLED DOWN ON THESE EFFORTS. IN FACT SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND TEN WE HAVE DOUBLED THE NUMBER OF ACRES TREATED BY FUEL REDUCTION. WE HAVE TRIPLED THE NUMBER OF ACRES THAT HAVE BEEN TREATED BY PRESCRIBED BURNING AND WE HAVE INCREASED OUR DEFENSIBLE SPACE INSPECTIONS BY OVER SIXTY THOUSAND HOMES. AND WE HAVE FACILITATED A HUNDRED ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OVER ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN GRANTS. FOR LOCAL FIRE PREVENTION PROJECTS. THE GOVERNOR'S JANUARY TEN BUDGET CONTINUES TO MAKE A SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT IN FIRE PREVENTION. THE BUDGET INCLUDES ADDITIONAL RESOURCES SPECIFICALLY DESIGNATED AS FUEL REDUCTION CREWS. THEY'RE DEDICATED TO REMOVING HAZARDOUS FUELS AND PERFORMING PRESCRIBED BURNS. CALIFORNIA'S DRY A MEDITERRANEAN CLIMATE HAS LENT ITSELF TO WILDFIRES FOR CENTURIES. AND WHILE WE MUST TAKE EVERY STEP TO PREVENT AND SUPPRESS HUMAN BECAUSE WILDFIRES. WE MUST ALSO ADAPT TO WILDFIRES. ADAPTING TO WILDFIRES IS A SYSTEMATIC APPROACH THERE IS NO ONE SILVER BULLET THAT'S GONNA SOLVE. THIS ISSUE. IT MEANS PLANNING COMMUNITIES THAT ARE HARDENED AGAINST WILDFIRES WITH FEW BREAKS IN AND AROUND THE COMMUNITIES. IT MEANS PROPERTY EVACUATION ROUTES WATER SUPPLIES FIRE PROTECTION RESOURCES. IT INCLUDES BUILDING HOMES OUT OF AMBER RESISTANT MATERIALS WHILE MAINTAINING THE ONE HUNDRED FOOT DEFENSIBLE SPACE BY REMOVING DEAD AN OVERGROWN VEGETATION. IN CALIFORNIA ARGUABLY HAS SOME OF THE MOST STRINGENT WELL IN BURNING. BUILDING CODES IN THE WORLD. WELL IN BUILDING CODES IN A WORLD. AND SINCE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT NEW CONSTRUCTION IN CALIFORNIA'S WHILE AND REQUIRES BUILDING MATERIALS THAT ARE AMBER RESISTANT. OF COURSE THE ONE MILLION DOLLAR QUESTION IS WHAT ABOUT ALL THE HOMES THAT WERE BUILT BEFORE TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT AND THAT IS. THE BIG ISSUE. UNDER AB TWENTY NINE ELEVEN WHICH WAS CHAIR FRIEDMAN'S BILL LAST YEAR. WE ARE IN THE NATIONAL STAGES OF OUR WORK WITH THE BOARD OF FORESTRY AND REVIEWING SUBDIVISIONS AND WILDLAND AREAS. THAT ARE BUILT WITHOUT SECONDARY EMERGENCY EGRESS TO IMPROVE. BOTH PUBLIC EVACUATIONS AND EMERGENCY ACCESS -- WELL IN URBAN INTERFACE COMMITTEE IS WORKING TO UPDATE OUR LIST OF RETROFITS FOR HOMES THAT WERE BUILT BEFORE THE TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT STANDARDS. IN A RECENT CO DEVELOPMENT -- CYCLE WE WE APPROVED. YOU WILL LIST OTHER STRIPPING AND SCREENS OVER SKYLIGHTS. AND THEY WERE ADOPTED BY THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING STANDARDS COMMISSION WILL BE ADDED TO THAT LIST OF OF ITEMS THAT HOMEOWNERS CAN CAN USE TO HARDEN THEIR HOMES. AGAINST DICK ENBERG MISSION. ANOTHER CRITICAL COMPONENT OF OUR FIRE PREVENTION ACTIVITIES IS OUR LAND USE PLANNING PROGRAM. WE WORK CLOSELY WITH LOCAL PLANNING BUILDING AND FIRE OFFICIALS TO ASSIST THEM IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SAFETY ELEMENTS OF THEIR GENERAL PLANS. WHEN AND WE PROVIDE THEM WITH INFORMATION TO ENSURE THEY MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS ON THE FIRE THREAT AND THE RISK IN THEIR AREA? WE ALSO SYSTEM WITH LOCAL HAZARD MITIGATION PLANS AND WORK WITH THEM TO SPEAK TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE SYNC WITH THE STATE HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN. IN THE CALIFORNIA UNIT FIRE PLANS. OR WELL IN FIRE ENGINEERING PROGRAM COORDINATES ARE DEFENSIBLE SPACE INSPECTION STATEWIDE THEY GATHER THE DATA FOR ANALYSIS. IN THEY ALSO MANAGER DAMAGE INSPECTION RESPONSE. THE DATA COLLECTED FROM THESE INSPECTIONS BOTH BOTH PRE FIRE IMPOSE FIRE. HELP US ANALYZE HOW HOME IGNITIONS OCCUR. AND WE CAN MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR HOME HARDENING IN THE FUTURE -- OUR PROGRAM ALSO CLOSELY WORKS WITH THE CPUC PURSUANT TO AN ANIMAL YOU THAT WE DESIGNED TO ENCOURAGE COLLABORATION AND COORDINATION. IN OVERALL WHILE FIRE MITIGATION EFFORTS. SHARING INFORMATION AND AND DATA. AND OF COURSE WE BEGIN THE PROCESS TO REVIEW THE ELECTRICAL CORPORATIONS WHILE FIRE MITIGATION PLANS. THAT PROCESS HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED IN TO DATE WE HAVE RECEIVED A PLANS. OUR LOCAL FIRE PREVENTION GRANT PROGRAM HAS FUNDED OVER TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILLION FIRE PRETTY PREVENTION PROJECTS TOTALING. OVER A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. THESE PROJECTS INCLUDE FUEL REDUCTION PUBLIC EDUCATION AND WELFARE PLANNING. FOR THE RECIPIENTS OF THESE GRANTS INCLUDE FIRE SAFE COUNCILS FIRE DISTRICTS NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS THAT FOCUS ON PREVENTING WILDFIRES. THE CURRENT REVIEW. OUR CURRENT REVIEW OF THREE HUNDRED AND FORTY IS -- IS GOING TO GO INTO THE CURRENT FUNDING WE HAVE A HUNDRED AND FIFTY FIVE MILLION THAT WILL BE SPLIT BETWEEN FOREST HEALTH PROJECTS. AND FIRE PREVENTION PROJECTS. IN FACT THIS BE NINE A ONE AS YOU KNOW AUTHORIZED ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN FUNDING FOR OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS FOR FUEL REDUCTION AND FIRE PREVENTION ACTIVITIES. AS WE EXPAND FUEL REDUCTION TREATMENTS ACROSS THE STATE THEY WILL UNDOUBTEDLY PLAY AN INCREASING ROLE DURING FIRE SUPPRESSION. HELPING TO SLOW OR STOP THE ADVANCE OF WILDFIRES ENCROACHING ON COMMUNITIES. BUT THERE'S ANOTHER KEY ELEMENT AND THAT'S THE THE ROLE THE CALIFORNIA HOMEOWNERS PLAY. 95% OF ALL WHILE EMPLOYERS ARE CAUSED BY THE ACTIVITY OF PEOPLE. THIS MEANS WE ABSOLUTELY ABSOLUTELY NEED RESIDENTS AND VISITORS TO BE EXTRA CAUTIOUS OUTDOORS TO PREVENT SPARKING A NEW WILDFIRE. WE ALL KNOW THAT DEFENSIBLE SPACE IS THE LAW. BUT WE NEED TO EDUCATE ON THE BENEFITS OF HOME HARD NAME. IT'S PROVEN TO DRAMATICALLY INCREASE THE CHANCE OF A HOME SURVIVE IN A WILDFIRE. OR CAL FIRES READY FOR WILDFIRE APP IS A GREAT TOOL THAT HOMEOWNERS CAN USE. IT IS CHOCK FULL OF INFORMATION ABOUT LANDSCAPE PROPER LANDSCAPING ABOUT DEFENSIBLE SPACE INSPECTION TIPS. AND EVEN HAS A LIST OF HOME HARDENING PROJECTS THAT THEY CAN AND DO OUR TO MAKE THEIR HOME MORE FIRE RESILIENT. AS THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT STRATEGIC FIRE PLAN STATES. THE VISION IS TO MAKE OUR NATURAL ENVIRONMENT MORE FIRE RESILIENT. MAKER HOMES IN INFRASTRUCTURE MORE FIRE. THREATS OF IN MEDICATIONS TO WILDLAND FIRE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND I LOOK FORWARD TO ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU CHIEF BEFORE WE GO TO MR SAITO I JUST WANT TO RECOGNIZE THROUGH A THREE ADDITIONAL MEMBERS WHO JUST JOINED US. ASSEMBLY MEMBER RICHARD BLOOM FROM SANTA MONICA ASSEMBLY MEMBER AL MURATSUCHI FROM TORRANCE AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER. MONIQUE LIMON FROM SANTA BARBARA WELCOME AND THANK YOU. WITH THAT MR SAITO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. RICHER FREEMEN THANK YOU MEMBERS. FOR GIVE ME THE OPPORTUNITY SPEAK -- THIS AFTERNOON MY NAME IS BRUCE I TELL I AM THE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA CONSERVATION CORPS AND I OR SORRY. BOB THERE IS [inaudible] CURRENT. THE CALIFORNIA CONSERVATION CORPS IS -- AS CHAIR FRIEDMAN SAID A FORTY THREE YEAR OLD. ORGANIZATION NOW SERVICE BY THAT FIRST TIME GOVERNOR JERRY BROWN BACK IN THE DAY. AND OUR MISSION BACK THEN AND STILL WAS TO PROVIDE -- JOB TRAINING AND SIR TWENTY FIVE YEARS OLD. AS THEY ENTER PROVIDE ENVIRONMENT ARE CUR COMMUNITY SERVICES ALL THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. CURRENTLY THE CALIFORNIA CONSERVATION CORPS HAS TWENTY FOUR CENTERS ALL THE WAY UP TO Y. RICA THAT GREEN THERE ARE HARD HAT THE TOP THERE IS Y. RICA. READING FOR THIS NORTH AND THEN -- TO FURTHER SOUTH ON THE NATIONAL SIT IN SAN DIEGO. THAT MAKES UP TWENTY FOUR CENTERS OF THOSE TWENTY FOUR CENTERS. EIGHT OR NINE OUR RESIDENTIAL CENTERS -- FOR BLUE HARD HATS THERE IN THE MIDDLE AND THEN THE OTHER ARE NON RESIDENT TO CENTER AND THEN WE HAVE FOR ENERGY CORES -- ALL OF THOSE NINE RESIDENTIAL CENTERS -- CURRENTLY THREE HAVE FIREFIGHTING CAPACITY SO WE HAVE A BUTTE. OF FIREFIGHTING CENTER IN PARTNERSHIP WITH CAL FIRE THAT RUNS THREE CRUISE IT'S GOING TO INCREASE -- TO FOR WE HAVE TO OF FIREFIGHTING CREWS OPERATING OUT OF OUR PLASTER CENTER. AND NOW WE'RE WORKING UP FROM TWO TO FOUR CRUZ EVENTUALLY OUT OF OUR CAMARILLO CENTER MMHM MMHM [inaudible] BURGER. SO WHAT THE PURPOSE ARE THESE FOR ME OF THIS DISCUSSION OF THIS PRESENTATION IS TO PROVIDE SOME. SOME INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT THE CCC IS DONE IN TERMS OF FEEL REDUCTION. OF FIRE. PREVENTION WORKER -- IN THE LAST COUPLE YEARS OF I WILL NOTE ARE YOU SHOULD NOTE THAT FOR THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN THE THE NUMBERS ARE MUCH LOWER THAN THERE ARE FOR THAT WERE FOR THE PREACHER AND THAT'S BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T TAKEN THE ACCOUNT A LOT OF ACTIVITY THAT WERE. THIS JANUARY TWO AT THE END OF THE FISCAL YEAR SO WE WILL -- FAR EXCEED THE SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN NUMBERS -- IN THIS FISCAL YEAR. EIGHTEEN NINETEEN AND THESE ARE THE COUNTIES ARE NOT ALL COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA BUT PRETTY SPREAD OUT -- IN SANTA BARBARA -- AND NORTHERN CALIFORNIA MANY COUNTY THROUGHOUT -- CALIFORNIA -- WHAT WE HAVE DONE IN TERMS OF FIRE PREVENTION AND FOR ONE PARTICULAR PROJECT THAT WE'RE VERY VERY PROUD OF OUR SAY THIS YEAR'S PROJECT CHRISS AMERICORPS FUNDED PROJECT THAT WORST WE JUST? WERE JUST ABOUT TO START A THIRD YEAR WHERE WE BASICALLY OUT. FORTY FIVE OUR CORE MEMBERS OR THREE CREWS WORKING AT THREE DIFFERENT LOCATIONS IN THE EASTERN SIERRA. WHILE WESTERN SEARS EXCUSE ME -- ONE CREW WORKING OUT A SHAVER LAKE. OKAY PRIMARILY WITH SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON. ANOTHER CREW WORKING IN SEQUOIA KINGS CANYON AND ANOTHER CREW ARE WORKING IN TWILA MAE ARM OR GROSVENOR. MOST WORKING WITH FIRE SAFE COUNCILS BUT ALSO OF LOCAL FIRE -- FUELS REDUCTION PROJECT BY THE CCC WERE AGAIN YOUNG FOLKS ARE WORKING IN CREWS OF FIFTEEN WORTH OF SUPERVISION. AND THERE FELLING TREES LIMóN UP REMOVING CHIPPING UP OF TREES OF CHEVROLET BECAUSE YOU KNOW AS A HIGH. FOR ME THE EPICENTER OF THOSE HUNDRED AND TWENTY NINE MILLION DEAD AND DYING TREES AND SO THOSE ARE THE TYPES OF ERRORS THAT WE'RE WORKING WITH. EITHER THROUGH THIS CASE AMERICORPS FUNDING OR MORE RECENTLY OR IN THE PAST WITH OUR STATE RESPONSIBLE DAIRY FUNDING OR MORE RECENTLY WITH GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUNNY. COMING FROM CALIFORNIA. AND THESE ARE THE TYPES OF CURRENT PROJECTS -- THAT WE'RE CURRENTLY WORKING ON FIRE PROTECTION AGAIN I MENTIONED WE HAVE SEVEN TYPE ONE FIREFIGHTING CREWS WORKING IN PARTNERSHIP WITH -- CAL FIRE SO THESE ARE REALLY -- PROTECTION BUT IF THERE EVER THERE IS A NON SEASON A FIREFIGHT IN SEASON THEY'RE DOING MOSTLY FEELS WORK. IN AROUND THE ERROR IS THAT THERE ARE ARE COMING FROM IN THOSE CENTERS ARE OUR CAMERA PLASTERED BEATS CENTER -- IN THE PROBE IS SOUGHT IN THIS LIVE IN A PROPOSED BUDGET FOR THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET. FOR NINETEEN TWENTY WE IDEALLY WILL INCREASE THE SEVEN TYPE ONE FIREFIGHTING CREWS. TO TWELVE BY INCREASING OUR CRUISE A CAMERA PLASTER AND BUTTE AS WELL AS OPENING OF OUR FIREFIGHTING CREWS OUT OUR LOS PADRES FOR SOUNDS OBISPO CENTER. OTHER TYPES OF FIRE PROTECTION AND PREVENTION ACTIVITIES THE SECOND BULLET THERE ARE. NOT ONLY ARE WE WORKING WITH CAL FIRE BUT WE ALSO HAVE PARTNERS WHO WAS SHIPS WITHIN -- ARE ROLLING OUT TYPE TO FIREFIGHTING CREWS AND WE HAVE THOSE RELATIONSHIPS AT ARE -- TAHOE READING YOU KYRA AND SAN DIEGO CENTERS. AND THEN AT THE BOTTOM THE THIRD BULLET POINT IS ARE WE DO A LOT OF FIRE PREVENTION. WORK IN AND AROUND A STATE RESPONSIBILITY OURS BUT ALSO FEDERAL AND LOCAL RESPONSIBILITY OR AS PRIMARILY WITH GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUNDS OR NOW MORE RECENTLY WITH -- POTENTIALLY WITH PROP SIX STATE FUNDS AND A ANDIN THE PAST ALSO OF PROP ONE BOND DOLLARS. UGH TO OTHER TYPES OF CREWS THAT WERE RUNNING THIS WHERE ARE YEAR -- ALL AROUND. REDUCTION AND PREVENTION WORK WE RUN SOMETHING COUNTY SOMEBODY TECH CAMP WERE. A CRUISE OF ABOUT FORTY FIVE CORPS MEMBERS ARE CRUZ ACTUALLY TENT SET SET UP TENT IN GROVE Là INTO WOLLEMI COUNTY. AND THEY'RE WORKING ON POST RIMFIRE FEELS REDUCTION AND HAZARDOUS TREE REMOVAL WORK AND THIS IS THE SECOND YEAR OF THIS PROJECT AND WE'RE FIND IT AGAIN BY GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUNDS AND THEN FINALLY. WE'RE ABOUT TO SET UP AN ARM RATE CAPS. ON A A LOS PINOS TO IN OUR WORLD WE'RE WHERE WE AGAIN WILL BE FIGHTING FORTY FIVE COMMERCE TO WORK EXCLUSIVELY ON FEELS REDUCTION WORK. PARTICULAR IN LIGHT OF THE UNHOLY FIRE THIS PAST -- THIS PAST YEAR SO EVEN THOUGH A LOT OF NOT. A LOT OF OUR WORK IS IN THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AREA OBVIOUSLY BECAUSE OF THE THOMAS FIRE. AND THE MORE RECENT THE HOLY FIRE -- SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THERE'S A GREAT NEED TO DO THAT SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA FUELS REDUCTION FIRE HAZARD REMOVAL WORK AS WELL. AND THAT -- CONCLUDES MY PRESENTATION. THANK YOU OUT BEFORE I MOVED TO QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE I WANT TO WELCOME. THREE ADDITIONAL MEMBERS WHO HAVE JUST JOINED US ASSEMBLY MEMBER SUSAN EGGMAN ASSEMBLY MEMBER CUT TASHA BURNER FOURTH OFF AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER KEVIN MCCARTY WANT TO THANK ALL OF YOU FOR JOINING US IN THIS VERY IMPORTANT TOPIC -- BEFORE I MOVED TO MY COMMITTEE MEMBERS I DO HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS -- FIRST FOR THE CHIEF AND AGAIN THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION. OF MY FIRST QUESTION IS THAT I KNOW THE CAL FIRE HAS A GOLD INSPECTING ALL KNOWN STRUCTURES IN THE STATE RESPONSIBILITY AREA EVERY THREE YEARS. BUT IT SEEMS FROM THE DATE OF THE CALL FIRE IS INSPECTING ABOUT A QUARTER OF THE STRUCTURES EACH YEAR AND I'M WONDERING WHAT IT WOULD TAKE FOR CAL FIRE TO BE ABLE TO MEET ITS GOAL. WELL IT'S A GOOD QUESTION -- THIS PAST YEAR WE WE HIT THE THE HIGHEST NUMBER WE'VE EVER MET THE GOAL OF TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND PER YEAR. IS ROUGHLY A STAB ABLE TO INSPECT EVERY DAY HOME EVERY THREE YEARS. AND SO -- YOU KNOW WE'VE -- THE ANSWER ANY IS IS ONE OF THE FASTEST GROWING AREAS IN THE STATE. AND SO WE WE ARE CONTINUING -- TO TO MAKE STRIDES IN THAT. BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE IF THE DATA ARE INSPECTIONS HAVE GROWN EVERY YEAR THE NUMBER OF INSPECTIONS HAS RISEN. EVERY YEAR BUT ARE ARE -- THE WHOLE PROCESS IS REALLY BEEN UNDER IS UNDER ANALYSIS. WERE USING SEASONAL WORK RIGHT NOW SEASONAL OF FOUR STREETS TO TO DO THAT DEFENSIBLE SPACE INSPECTION IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR ENGINE COMPANIES WHO WE RELIED ON GREATLY TO GO OUT AND AND TO ASSIST WITH THAT BUT THEY HAVEN'T BEEN AS AVAILABLE AS THEY HAVE. IN THE IN THE PAST FEW YEARS. AND SO WE'RE WE'RE CONDUCTING A WORKLOAD ANALYSIS OF WHAT OF WHAT IS THE WORKLOAD THE TRUE WORKLOAD AND AND AND AND THE WAY THAT WE CAN STAFF THAT APPROPRIATELY. THANK YOU -- NOW I'M WONDERING ABOUT WHETHER THERE ARE ANY BARRIERS. TO YOU AN ACTING FUEL BREAKS NEAR COMMUNITIES AND HOW IMPORTANT DO YOU FEEL THAT IS FOR CAL FIRE TO HAVE A SAY IN THOSE FUEL BREAKS AND KIND OF HOW HOW IS THAT GOING GETTING THOSE ESTABLISHED -- WILL FUEL BREAKS. THE SPAN JURISDICTIONAL BOUNDARIES. AND SO IT'S IMPORTANT THAT. OUR UNIT PERSONNEL ARE INVOLVED IN THOSE DISCUSSIONS AND IN THAT PLANNING PROCESS. WE HAVE THE HISTORY THE FIRE HISTORY. AND WE AND WE KNOW STRATEGICALLY WHERE FOR THOSE FEW BREAKS -- WE ALSO WERE CHALLENGED BY THE PERMITTING PROCESS THE ENVIRONMENTAL AND LOCAL PERMITTING. AND THEN AVAILABILITY OF CREWS OF OUR PEOPLE KNOWING TO DO THE WORK BUT ALSO -- TO TO REVIEW THE PLANS. AND THIS IS THIS NEW NORMAL HAS IMPACTED FIRE PREVENTION AND IN THAT KIND OF THE WAY. CAN I ASK YOU A QUESTION I'VE BEEN ASKING A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO WORK IN IN FIRE PREVENTION -- REMOVING -- AND DEAD TREES -- CAN BE. MATIC FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE LOW INCOME ELDERLY BECAUSE OF THE EXPENSE AND LOS ANGELES A COSTS. ANYWHERE FROM FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS UP I'VE SEEN AS HIGH AS FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS TO HAVE AN INSURED LICENSED. TREAT TREAT COMPANY COME IN AND REMOVE A LARGE TREES SO A LOT OF PEOPLE EVEN THOUGH THEY KNOW THEY HAVE A DEAD TREE. THEY JUST DON'T FEEL THAT THEY CAN AFFORD IT OR THEIR OF TAKE THE RISK. DO YOU KNOW OF ANY PROGRAMS TO HELP LOW INCOME PEOPLE DO THAT OUR IS THERE ANYTHING YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH AND DO YOU HAVE ANY SUGGESTIONS ON ANY WAY THAT WE CAN HELP THAT GET DONE DO YOU WORK WITH LOCAL COMMUNITIES ARE IN JURISDICTIONS. TO TRY TO TO HELP WITH THE UNIFIED AS WELL AS OUR LAND USE PLANNING AND AND FIRE PREVENTION PERSONNEL -- THAT'S A TOUGH ISSUE -- IT'S ULTIMATELY THE HOMEOWNERS RESPONSIBILITY TO PROVIDE THE CLEARANCE. AND YOU KNOW THERE MAY BE SOME INSURANCE INCENTIVES FOR THE LANDOWNER THE HOMEOWNR -- THERE MAY BE SOME GRANTS THROUGH SOME NON PROFITS THAT MIGHT BE AVAILABLE BUT THERE THAT'S ULTIMATELY ABOUT ALL WE CAN WE CAN PROVIDE AT THIS TIME. OKAY AND A DIRECTOR SAITO THANKS YOU VERY MUCH FOR FOR BLOOM -- SOME LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND CAL FIRE ARE ALLOWED TO DO DEFENSIBLE SPACE WORK IN AREAS WHERE THE HOMEOWNERS WON'T DO IT -- AREN'T ABLE TO DO IT DO YOU THINK THE CCC CAN BE HELPFUL AND AND ANY OF THAT WORK. I THINK WE CAN AND SHOULD WOULD TYPICALLY YOU KNOW WERE PREVENTED FROM ME THE ERROR HAS TO BE OF BENEFIT TO THE PUBLIC AND TYPICALLY WE WOULD WORK ON PRIVATE PROPERTIES BUT WE DO WORK IN AND AROUND PRIVATE PROPERTIES. MOST OF TIME TOO FAR SAID COUNCIL SO THEY'RE HERE TO SO I THINK THAT'S ONE WAY FOR US TO WORK ON THOSE PRIVATE PROPERTIES. AND LET ME JUST ASK YOU IN IF IF THE CHIEF WANTS TO TO CHIME IN AS WELL THAT'S FINE THIS IS MY LAST QUESTION IS FOR MY COMMITTEE MEMBERS WHO ARE PROBABLY GETTING IMPATIENT DONE SOME ENERGY EFFICIENCY WORK AND COULD YOU BE INVOLVED IN HOME HARDENING. EFFORTS AGAIN IT'S THE SAME QUESTION ABOUT IS IT FOR THE PUBLIC BENEFITS OF TYPICALLY AND HISTORICALLY WE HAVE NOT WORKED ON PRIVATE PROPERTY IS LIKE THAT BUT YOU KNOW I'M AS I'M SITTING HERE -- WAS TALKING TO SOME OF MCCARTY RECENTLY ABOUT A CONSTRUCTION CORPS MAYBE THERE COULD BE A HARDENING CORE I NEEDED DIFFERENT MARKETING -- IMAGER BUT I MEAN ANYTHING'S POSSIBLE I'M SO THE THOSE ENERGY EFFICIENCY WORK THAT WE'VE DONE THEY'VE ALL BEEN ON PUBLIC OR NON-PROFIT BUILDINGS BUT I I'D BE INTRIGUED OR INTERESTED TO SEE IF THERE ARE. SOME WAY TO DO THIS. OKAY THANK YOU. WITH THAT I'LL TURN MY COACH HERE TO SEE IF SHE HAS ANY QUESTIONS. I DO HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS REGARDING THIS YOU SEE SEE I SAY THAT OF MANY TREES SO YOU'RE TAKING DOWN. AND MANY TREES ARE PROBABLY CHIPPING SOME. BUT THERE'S PLENTY OF TREES THAT CAN'T GO THROUGH A CHIPPER -- WHAT DO YOU WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH THOSE TREES ARE THERE IS SOME KIND OF SOLUTION OF WHERE WE'RE GOING? TO GET RID OF SOME OF THAT WASTE. THERE'S ALWAYS A PLAN BECAUSE WE'RE NOT THE PONSOR OF A PROJECT LIKE THAT SO WE'LL WORK OUT SOME PLAN IN ADVANCE AND SO YES OF THE CAN'T BE HAULED AWAY. IF IT CAN'T BE CHIPPED OF A CAT B. ROW SET UP LOG DACHSHUND STACKED -- THEY'LL BE SOME KIND OF OPTION LIKE THAT AND NOT JUST OBVIOUSLY CUT DOWN THE LEAVES OF THE TREES ARE TO BRING THEIR ON THEIR OFF THERE IS ALWAYS SOME PLAN OF THE WORK THAT WE DO. AND THE OTHER QUESTION I HAVE IS THAT -- THE TO DO AS MANY PROBABLY HOMES ARE CHECKING PROPERTIES -- CAN BE CHALLENGING CONSIDERING WE'VE HAD FIRES PRETTY MUCH YEAR ROUND. AND THE TIMING FOR YOU TO GO OUT AND ACTUALLY GO OUT AND CHECK THOSE -- PROPERTIES MUST BE DIFFICULT -- DO YOU HAVE LIKE THIS BUT AS A SPECIFIC -- TEAM THAT GOES OUT AND JUST LOOKS AT FIRED. DEFENSIBLE SPACER HOW'S THAT WORK WELL IT'S DONE AT THE UNIT LEVEL -- WE HAVE TWENTY ONE UNITS THROUGHOUT THE STATE IN IN -- DEFENSIBLE SPACE INSPECTORS FOUR STREETS HAVE BEEN APPROPRIATED IN EACH ONE OF THOSE UNITS -- BUT YOU'RE RIGHT WHETHER PLAYS A FACTOR IN THAT FIRE ACTIVITY A TYPICALLY ARE DEFENSIBLE SPACE INSPECTORS ARE SEASONAL. AND THE DEPENDING ON HOW THE THE PERSONAL MONTHS WERE APPROPRIATED THEY CAN BE THERE FOR MONTHS THEY CAN BE THERE NINE MONTHS -- BUT YOUR ENGINE COMPANIES IN THE UNITS BUT THERE THE CHALLENGES THEY'RE FIGHTING FIRE NOWADAYS. I THINK THE DENTAL HAVE FOR NOW. THANK YOU ANY OTHER COMMITTEE MEMBERS SAID ASSEMBLYMEMBER CITY THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR. THE CHIEFS THANK YOU BESIDES SO FOR YOUR TESTIMONY YOU KNOW I WANTED TO A TRY TO BRIDGE MY UNDERSTANDING OF OF CAL FIRE IS WORK RELATIVE TO THE PC'S WORK AND IN FIRE PREVENTION AND SO HOPEFULLY THE THAT THAT DOESN'T GO. TOO FAR BEYOND THE THE SCOPE OF TODAY'S HEARING -- BUT YOU START OFF CHIEF -- YOU YOU TALK ABOUT 95%. OF THE DO YOU SEE 95% OF ALL -- ARE CAUSED BY PEOPLE OKAY -- BUT ISN'T THE CASE THAT THEY AT LEAST THE FOR FROM WHAT I RECALL THAT MOST OF THE MAJOR FIRES. THAT THE BIGGEST WATER FIRE IS IN IN IN RECENT YEARS -- MANY IF NOT THE MAJORITY BEEN CAUSED BY -- THE UTILITY -- PARALYZED -- NO NO. NO. SOME OF THE BIGGER FIRES -- ARE STILL UNDER INVESTIGATION OF COURSE NOW -- BUT ON A DAY TO DAY THAT OF THE FIRES THAT OUR CREWS ROLL OUT ON A DAILY BASIS THE MAJORITY THERE MORE HUMAN CAUSED. EITHER TRYING TO CLEAR THEIR PROPERTIES. HE DUMB HUMAN ACTS -- INTENTIONAL SETS WHATEVER WHATEVER THE THE BECAUSE IS OKAY -- BAY IS IS IT FAIR TO SAY THAT THERE HAVE BEEN SOME MAJOR WILDFIRES THAT THAT HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY THE THE THE VEGETATION -- SOME THE POWER LINES -- THERE HAVE BEEN SOME CASES THAT HAVE BEEN ADJUDICATED THIS. ONE WITH. WITH SUCH FINDINGS. IS THAT CORRECT CORRECT OKAY ALL RIGHT SO SO GIVEN THAT -- IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FIRE PREVENTION HERE THAT A BIG PART OF IT IS. IS -- THE THE ELECTRICITY GRID -- YOU KNOW. AND AND AND AND IT'S INTERACTION WITH THE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT -- THERE THERE THERE IS A RECENT -- FINDING THAT -- WE DISCUSSED IN THE ENERGY UTILITIES COMMITTEE HERE AIR -- THE PRESIDENT OF THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION ADMITTED THAT. THAT THEY HAD NEVER -- FIND A UTILITY. FOR FAILING TO TAKE NECESSARY FIRE PREVENTION -- ACTIVITIES OR OUR EFFORTS -- AND AND AND THAT CONCERNS ME BECAUSE IT SEEMS THAT YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT STRUCTURES IN THE STATE RESPONSIBILITY AREAS BUT WORK. TALKING ABOUT THE ELECTRICITY GRID AND OVER TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND MILES OF OF POWER LINES RUNNING THROUGH SOME OF THE THE MOST FIRE PRONE AREAS IN OUR STATE -- DOES THE WAY WHAT IS CAL FIRE IS -- ROLE IN MONITORING THE UTILITIES -- EFFORTS TO ON ON ON FIRE PREVENTION. WELL -- BASICALLY OUR OUR ROLE IS THAT IF WE SEE WHAT WE THINK IS A VIOLATION WILL REPORT THAT AND ARE LAW ENFORCEMENT PERSONNEL OR PREVENTION PERSONNEL WILL FOLLOW UP WITH IT. BUT IT'S ULTIMATELY THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE UTILITY TO ENSURE THAT THE VEGETATION CLEARANCES ARE MAINTAINED. AND THE C. P. U.'S GENERAL SAFETY ORDERS REQUIRE THAT. THAT THEY ENFORCE THAT AND AND SO -- AND AND AND WHO WHOSE RESPONSIBILITY IS IT TO OVERSEE THE UTILITIES TO ENSURE THAT THERE ADEQUATELY AND EFFECTIVELY CONDUCTING -- FIRE SAFETY INSPECTIONS. I WOULD SAY THAT WOULD BE THE CPUC ARE. SO AND AND WHAT -- HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE CAL THE THE CPC IN TERMS OF FIRE PREVENTION ACTIVITIES -- WE HAVE A COLLABORATIVE RELATIONSHIP -- AS I MENTIONED WE ENTERED INTO AN AMMO YOU ABOUT EIGHTEEN MONTHS AGO -- AND IN THE INTENT OF THAT IMHO YOU WAS TO INCREASE THOSE COLLABORATIVE EFFORTS. SHARE INFORMATION AS APPROPRIATE -- ON INSPECTION DATA AND AND IT BOTH ELECTRONIC AND OTHERWISE SO -- AND THEN OF COURSE WITH THE SB NINE A ONE NOW WITH WELL FIRE MITIGATION PLANS WERE INVOLVED IN THAT PROCESS. BUT IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT -- THE THE CPC IS STILL THE LEAD AGENCY IN TERMS OF AND THE ENFORCEMENT OF OF WILD FIRE PREVENTION ACTIVITIES AS THEY RELATE TO UTILITIES CORRECT. THE THE REQUIREMENTS ARE IN THE P. R. C.. THE CLEARANCE REQUIREMENTS. AND IT'S THE THE UTILITIES RESPONSIBILITY TO ENSURE THAT THOSE THOSE REQUIREMENTS ARE MET. AND THE CPU. YOU SEE HAS SOME OVERSIGHT AND THE CPC RATHER GENERAL SAFETY ORDERS DOES CAL FIRE HAVING OVERSIGHT OVER THE HILL AS THERE'S NO MANDATE FOR US TO DO INSPECTIONS -- BUT IT BUT AS I MENTIONED THAT WHEN OUR CREWS ARE OUT SOME UNIT TO DO DO -- DO DRIVE THE LINES AND THEY'LL SITE OF VIOLATIONS -- BUT WHEN OUR CREWS ARE THE REPORTED THINK IT'S FOLLOWED UP ON BY OUR FIRE PREVENTION STAFF. THAT'S CERTAINLY HOW WORKS. DO YOU HAVE AN OPINION AS TO HOW GOOD OF A JOB THE CPC IS DOING IN TERMS OF ENFORCING -- THE WHAT FOR PROTECT THE WHY FIRE PREVENTION ACTIVITIES AS THEY RELATE RELATE TO UTILITIES. I DIDN'T. DO YOU HAVE A OPINION AS TO THE IN THE THE THE THE NATURE AND THE EXTENT OF THE COOPERATION BETWEEN. THE CPC AND CAL FIRE AS THEY RELATE. TO WHAT FIRE AND PREVENTION ACTIVITIES WE HAVE GOOD COOPERATION YEAH THAT'S IMPROVING WE HAVE. WE HAVE DEDICATED STAFF WORKS VERY VERY CLOSELY WITH THEIR THEIR SAFETY DIVISION. BUT ULTIMATELY WHEN IT WHEN IT COMES DOWN. TO INSPECTING IN ENFORCING THE WHAT FOR PREVENTION ACTIVITIES OF THE UTILITIES THAT RESPONSIBILITY LIES -- LIES WITH THE PC [inaudible] CORRECT. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. ASSEMBLYMEMBER CARTY. GET THIS TO A QUICK QUESTION FOLLOWING UP ON YEARS -- SURE FRIEDMAN AS FAR AS THE CONSERVATION CORPS AND YOU'RE WORKING YOU KNOW FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU FOR THE WORK THAT YOU DO NOT JUST IN THIS FIELD BUT ACROSS. CALIFORNIA AND ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES AND STEWARDSHIP AND WORKING WITH. PEOPLE WHO. MAY TWENTY SECOND CHANCE AND SO -- HATS OFF FOR THAT -- I JUST WANTED TO KNOW -- ON THE BARRIERS THAT EXISTS OR HURT RELATED THIS WORKER THAT -- THAT -- THAT COULD BE STOPPING YOU FROM DOING MORE -- AS THAT WORK THAT -- MYSTERY MENTIONED EARLIER AS FAR AS PATIENTS AND AND RESOURCES OF COURSE ALWAYS COMES DOWN TO THAT. ANOTHER'S INITIALLY WERE WORKING AT THIS YEAR LEGISLATION RELATED PAROLEES FIRST PROBATIONERS BUT ANY OTHER POLICIES THAT YOU MAY WANT TO AND LIGHTNESS ABOUT. AND I'M MONEY PIECE TO HER I DON'T THINK POLICIES AS MUCH AS JUST AN ARDENT ONLY TALKED A LOT ABOUT BOX SPENDING OUR CREWS FIREFIGHTING TYPE ON FIRE FIGHTING CREWS FROM. SEVEN TO TWELVE THAT'S IN THE PROPOSED GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET I SEE AS A MEMBER EGGMAN OR RAISE YOUR HAND WE OFFER AB TWENTY ONE TWENTY SIX WOULD ALSO INCREASE. OUT ON FOR NEW OF FORESTRY COR CRUISE SO FUNDING ISSUES LIKE THAT ARE WE DON'T HAVE -- UNLIMITED ABILITY TO HIRE JUST A THOUSAND PEOPLE. BUT CERTAINLY UP THERE WERE FUNDING -- AND THERE WERE THERE CERTAIN THE NEED TO HIRE AND WORK MORE THOSE YOUNG FOLKS OUR CORE MEMBERS -- SO CERTAINLY FUNDING IS AN ISSUE AND AND MORE PARTLY THAT I THINK AND THE REASON I'M HERE SIR. HOW WE PRIORITIZE THAT PHONE AND HOW WE DIVVY UP THAT SB NINE A ONE DOLLARS AND -- RIGHT NOW WE WE HAVE FIVE IN THIS NINETEEN TWENTY BUDGET WE HAVE FIVE MILLION DOLLARS OUT OF SB NINE ONE FUNDING. OF THAT COULD INCREASE AND ACT AND BASED ON THESE KINDS OF DISCUSSIONS I THINK THEY THEY WOULD GO A LONG WAY. TO MAKING THAT ARGUMENT IF THERE WAS FOR WE COULDN'T GET UNLIMITED. MONEY TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS NEXT YEAR THERE'S LOGISTICS ISSUES ON YOUR AND AS FAR AS HOW MANY. MORE YOU COULD TAKE HOW MANY MORE INDIVIDUALS YES ECONOMY IS GREAT IT'S NOT EVERY. PERSON THAT WANTS TO WORK FOR MINIMUM WAGE BUT I THINK WE'RE ALSO LOOKING FOR THAT YOUNG PERSON I WANT TO CAREER. AND WANT TO SERVE THEIR STATE IN THEIR COMMUNITIES THAT YOUR TAGLINE LOW PAY. CRUMMY WHAT IS IT WAS AGAIN HARD WORK LOW PAY MISERABLE CONDITION. HARD WORK LOW PAY BECAUSE THERE ARE OKAY. THANK YOU THANK YOU BY DECEMBER. THANK YOU SO MEMBER SELLING MEMBER EGGMAN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THANK YOU BOTH FOR THE PRESENTATION. OF PLACE I GOT CAUGHT UP TO WHERE I JUST WANT TO ECHO WHAT. MY COLLEAGUE ASSEMBLYMEMBER AGUIAR-CURRY TALKED ABOUT BECAUSE I THINK WE'RE ALL ALWAYS WORRIED ABOUT WHAT WE DO WITH ALL THAT TIMBER WHEN WE PULL IT OUT -- THAT WE NEED TO HAVE MORE AND USE MARKETS FOR THAT TIMBER TO BE ABLE TO GO SOMEWHERE NOT JUST BE STACKED UP -- CONTINUE TO CONTACT DISEASE AND THEN SPREADING AS WE KNOW THE AS WE KNOW IT SPREADS -- SO. THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT MY THE BILL I DID LAST YEAR AB TWENTY ONE TWENTY SIX WE START FOUR NEW BRANCHES WORKING IN FORESTRY AND ENCOURAGING YOUNG PEOPLE. TO GET INTO THAT -- HAVE YOU ARE EAST YOU HAVE IDEAS -- AND THEN JUST AS AN ASIDE I DO A LOT OF WORK AROUND CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM ALSO AND I KNOW THAT PEOPLE CAN. COME INTO THE CALIFORNIA CONSERVATION CORPS POST POST FELONY POST -- WHEN THEY COME OUT OF PRISON? SO THAT'S JUST ANOTHER ANOTHER WAY AND I'M THINKING AS WE BEST USE OUR PUBLIC DOLLARS WE'RE SUPPORTING AND PEOPLE GETTING CAREERS ARE ALSO. AT REDUCING LEVELS OF RECIDIVISM RATE SO JUST WONDERED ABOUT THE PLANNING FOR AB TWENTY ONE TWENTY SIX AND THEN HOW YOU GO ABOUT RECRUITMENT. FIVE IN FACT OUR MEETING THIS THURSDAY WITH THE ARE GREATER VALLEY CONSERVE IT LOCAL CONSERVATION CORPS TO BEGIN THAT PLANNING PROCESS EVEN THOUGH OF COURSE. THIS BUDGET HAS BEEN APPROVED -- PASSED OUT -- AND I THINK YOU KNOW ALSO -- BEEN PART OF THE TREE MORTALITY TASK FORCE WITH CAL FIRE. IN MORE RECENT OF FORCE MANAGEMENT -- TASK FORCE AND SO ARE MY ROLE IS NOT AROUND -- BILE MASTER PART OF THE LARGER PLANNINGPROCESS ONE WERE REMOVING LOGS THE TREES FROM THE FORCE AND IF THERE ARE IS A WAY -- TO USE THOSE AS VILE FEELS WE ABSOLUTELY SHOULD DO THAT -- AND THEN FOR THE ARE EVER GONNA CONTINUES DISCUSS I THINK WITH SUPPORT LIKE FROM -- SOME REMEMBER CARTER'S OFFICE AND LOOKING AT DIFFERENT WAYS TO HELP REDUCE RECIDIVISM AS WELL AS INCLUDE PEOPLE YOUNG FOLKS THAT NEED THAT SECOND CHANCE OUR THIRD OR FOURTH CHANCE -- IN THIS PROCESS WE WANT TO BE VERY ACTIVE AND I THINK IT'S IN SOME WAYS IT'S SAD -- TYRON ABOUT ARE WE HAVE A NEW ON A RESIDENTS CITING DELTA WHICH IS IT ACTING NEXT DOOR TO THE DJJ INSTITUTION THERE WE HAVE OUR OTHER CAT REAL RESIDENTIAL SITE IS NEXT DOOR TO THE OUR FACILITY AND AND IT'S KIND OF A RD THAT. WE HAVE A CONSERVATION CORNER EVER YOU GET DJ SITE SO WE WANT TO WORK WITH THOSE. FOLKS BECAUSE I PERSONALLY BELIEVE THEY NEED THAT CHANCE. THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER CARTY YEAH I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY WHAT MISS EGGMAN BROUGHT THAT'S A GREAT POINT IT. YOU KNOW YOU CAN BE INCARCERATED BE FIGHTING FIRES OUT THERE AND THEN WHEN YOU'RE RELEASED YOU CAN'T COULD DO THE SAME WORK AND SO I KNOW. THIS RACE IS WORKING ON THAT BUT AS FAR AS PROBATION AND PRO WE WE TREAT DIFFERENTLY AND SO WITH THE THERE WILL BE A PROPOSAL THIS YEAR THAT WE CAN ALL WORK ON CLARIFYING IT FOR PAROLEES CLEAR FIGHT TWO YEARS AGO. PROBATIONERS BUT WE NEED TO GO BACK. AND AND TACKLE THE ISSUE FOR PAROLEES TO WORK WITH THE CCC. THANK YOU. QUESTIONS ASSEMBLYMEMBER CITY THANK YOU -- CHIEF BY A IF I MAY HAVE -- BRIEFLY FOLLOW UP ON MY EARLIER QUESTIONS. DID DE DO YOU THINK. THE STATE CAN DO A BETTER JOB IF OUR FIRST RESPONDERS FAR IF OUR CAL FIRE WERE IN CHARGE OF THE UTILITIES -- WILD FIRE PREVENTION ACTIVITIES OR OR OR OR THEIR AND WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT WOULD BE THE CHALLENGES OF CAL FIRE TAKING OVER THE STATEWIDE FIRE PREVENTION ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS AS THEY RELATE TO THE UTILITIES. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION ASSEMBLY MEMBER BUT THAT THAT WENT OUT OF MY LANE. I APPRECIATE THE ASK BUT I'M NOT PREPARED TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION OKAY. ALL RIGHT THANK. ANYBODY ELSE.

THE FLOOR IS YOURS ALL RIGHT THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR IS MEMBERS STAFF I REALLY APPRECIATE THE INVITATION AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO DRIVE FROM EUREKA TO PARTICIPATE IN AN PUBLIC GOVERNMENT IT'S A IT'S A FUN PROCESS -- YOU KNOW JUST A LITTLE BIT ABOUT CORPORATE EXTENSION I I DIDN'T TALK MUCH ABOUT IT BUT SINCE THIS IS THE JOINT COMMITTEE WITH -- WITH COUNTY GOVERNMENT JUST REMEMBER THE COOPERATIVE EXTENSION IS EMBEDDED IN COUNTY GOVERNMENT SO I SERVE AS A DEPARTMENT HEAD WITHIN THE COUNTIES OF HUMBOLDT AND DEL NORD -- AND WE ARE IN THIS YOU KNOW NICE PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AND AND COUNTY SO -- WERE IN A FIFTY SIX FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES -- STATEWIDE SO -- WE DO MY JOB IS IN EDUCATION OUTREACH AND RESEARCH AND MY COLLEAGUES AND I HAVE WORKED IN THIS ISSUE OF OF HOME SURVIVAL IN TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT. WHAT WE CAN DO TO TO BUILD SMARTER -- TO TODAY'S PRESENTATION IS IS DESIGNED TO TO TRY AND ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE PIECES IT'S GROUNDED IN BOTH THE OBSERVATION OF OF MANY WILDFIRES AS WELL AS IN -- MORE EMPIRICAL LABORATORY BASED STUDY SO I'VE GOT A FEW SLIDES HERE -- JUST TO ILLUSTRATE SOME OF THE CONCEPTS BECAUSE I THINK IT'LL SLIDE SPEAK BETTER THAN THE WORDS THEMSELVES. SO LET'S TALK ABOUT THE TAKE HOME POINTS HERE. AND WHAT I'D LIKE TO TO START WITH AND AND THAT IS THAT WE HAVE A FIRE FIGHTING AGENCY WHICH AND ANNA FIRE FIGHTING APPARATUS AND AND I LOVE THE CONCEPT BUT I'D LIKE TO SORT OF STEP BACK A LITTLE BIT AND THINK ABOUT THE FACT THAT. IT WITH OTHER NATURAL FORCES SUCH AS EARTHQUAKES TORNADOES OR HURRICANES WE DON'T FIGHT THEM. RIGHT WE ADOPTED WE BUILD SMARTER AND SO I THINK THERE'S A A ROOM AND A NEED FOR A SEA CHANGE IN THINKING ABOUT OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH FIRE. CALIFORNIA IS YOU KNOW VERY MUCH OF THE VEGETATION IS FIRE ADOPTED IN SOME RESPECTS IT'S ALSO FIRE DEPENDED SO HOW DO WE GET THE PUBLIC TO UNDERSTAND. AND HOW DO WE WORK TOGETHER TO DRY AND ADOPTED BUILD SMARTER -- SIMILAR YOU KNOW TO WHAT WE DO WITH FOUNDATIONS WITH YOU KNOW ALL THE ELEMENTS THAT ARE HOMES. AS DISCUSSED EARLIER THE MAJORITY OF HOMES ARE LOST FROM EMBERS IT'LL SHOW YOU SOME IMAGES OF WHAT THOSE ARE IN A MINUTE -- BUT THAT'S VERY DIFFERENT FROM A FLAMING FRONT WHICH MOST PEOPLE THINK ABOUT WHEN IT COMES THE FIRE. THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT NEW BUILDING CODES ARE HELPING -- THEY'RE NOT THEY'RE NOT PERFECT YET AND WE CAN SEE THAT IN PARADISE WHERE 25% OF THE HOMES THAT -- SURVIVE POST TWO THOUSAND EIGHT WILL. POST TWO THOUSAND A CONSTRUCTION OF LET'S NOT OF HIGH THAT WOULD HAVE LIKE -- TO BUT IF IT DOES SHOW THAT WE ARE HOW WE ARE CAPABLE OF MAKING A DIFFERENCE SO HOW DO WE INCENTIVIZE THE UPGRADES TO THE EXISTING HOMES AND NOT PROCESS AND I THINK THAT'S THE OPEN QUESTION. ON THE FLOOR TODAY SO WHAT I'D LIKE TO TO LEAVE WITH IS REALLY THIS IDEA OF WHAT WE THINK ABOUT WITH PUBLIC RESOURCES CODE. FORTY TWO NINETY ONE AND WHAT CAN WE DO AROUND DEFENSIBLE SPACE -- AND HOW DO WE GET THE PUBLIC TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF A NON COMBUSTIBLE ZONE IMMEDIATELY AROUND THEIR HOUSE. INSTEAD OF THINKING ABOUT WORKING FROM THE PROPERTY IN WERE TO THE HOUSE AND HOW DO YOU WORK FOR THE PROPERTY OUTWARD AND TAKE CARE OF OUR STUFF RIGHT IT'S IT'S KIND OF THAT CURTILAGE THEM WHERE PEOPLE THINK IT'S A LITTLE BIT OFF LIMITS BUT IN REALITY IT'S MAKING A MAJOR. DIFFERENCE IN THE SURVIVAL OF HOMES LET'S LOOK AT SOME OF THOSE IMAGES. SO I WILL BE ABLE TO TALK IN EXTENSIVE DETAIL BUT IT'S WANT TO GIVE YOU THE SENSE THAT. THE BUILDING CODES ARE DESIGNED AND A TO THINK ABOUT DIFFERENT TYPES OF FLAME CONTACT A RADIANT HEAT OR EMBERS AND THERE ARE IMPORTANT NUANCES IN EACH OF THOSE TYPES OF EXPOSURES WITH YOU HAVE. TOO MUCH HEAT RIGHT OUTSIDE THE OUTSIDE YOUR BUILDING LOS CAUSES COMBUSTION WHETHER OF FLAMES THAT DIRECTLY TOUCH THE HOUSE OR WHETHER YOU'RE BEING. YOU KNOW BOMBARDED WITH THE HAILSTORM OF LITTLE BITS OF BURNING EMBERS A AND THAT'S OF A PICTURE OF THE LAB THAT'S IN -- SOUTH CAROLINA THAT WE'RE SO MUCH OF THIS IS TESTED JUST TO GIVE YOU AN ILLUSTRATION OF THE KIND OF SCALE AND MODELING THAT'S DONE TO BE ABLE TO EVALUATE THESE ISSUES SO. AS A AS WAS SAID EARLIER WINDBLOWN MEMBERS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MAJORITY OF BUILDING IGNITIONS AND YOU CAN SEE THIS PICTURE I THINK FOR A FROM SOUTH LAKE TAHOE WITH THE ANGORA FIRE WHERE THERE'S ALMOST. YOU KNOW VERY LITTLE EVIDENCE OF FIRE IN THE SURROUNDING -- FORESTED SETTING BUT THE HOME IS LOST SO HOW DID THAT HAPPEN RIGHT MOST PEOPLE CAN'T GRASP THAT THAT YOU THESE NUMBERS ARE CAPABLE OF MOVING MORE THAN A MILE IN FRONT OF A FLAMING FRONT. AND AND CAUSING THESE KINDS OF LOSSES. SO THERE YOU KNOW EVERYONE WANTS TO KNOW WHAT TO DO AND WHERE TO START AND THAT'S BEYOND WHAT I HAVE TIME TO TALK ABOUT HERE TODAY BUT JUST TO SAY THERE ARE PRIORITIES. THE SHIFT DEPENDING IF YOU'RE NEIGHBORING HOUSES VERY CLOSE TO YOU WHETHER YOU HAVE SOME SEPARATION BETWEEN BUILDINGS. OF THE MOST IMPORTANT PIECE OF COURSE IS THE ROOF AND THE ROOF EDGE -- AND THEN THE VENTILATION SYSTEM WHICH IS SO IMPORTANT FOR LETTING THAT WARM MOIST AIR OUT YOUR HOUSE YOUR YOU KNOW SECURE. WOULD DOESN'T ROT ON THE INSIDE YOUR HOUSES WITHOUT A CLAIM THE AWFUL ENVIRONMENT BUT ALSO TO BE STRONG AND BE ABLE TO RESIST OF THE THE INTRUSION OF EMBERS. SO YOU NEED YOU NEED SORT OF LIKE THE GORE TEX OF YOUR HOUSE IF YOU CAN THINK OF IT THAT WAY. AND THEN THE VEGETATION DEFENSIBLE SPACE AND BECOMES KIND OF THIRD AND THAT PRIORITY LIST -- AND THEN WE COULD TALK MORE IF WE HAD MORE TIME THOSE PIECES BUT I WON'T I WON'T GO INTO THAT NOW. WELL LET'S JUST THINK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THESE POINTS OF ENTRY AROUND THE HOME ITSELF SO -- IF YOUR HOME IS -- UNLUCKY TO BE BOMBARDED BY THOSE EMBERS YOU MIGHT HAVE LOST BECAUSE YOU HAVE VEGETATION LIKE LITTLE -- LATER LEAVES ON THE ON THE CONNECTION BETWEEN IF YOU CAN SEE NOW I GUESS I GET SHOULD THE FOR RIGHT HERE WHERE YOU'VE GOT -- THE ROOF TO WALL CONTACT RIGHT THERE AND THEN YOU CAN SEE THAT THAT WALL IS NOT RESISTANT TO THE FLAMES AND AND FIRE CAN ENTER THAT WAY OR YOUR RAIN GUTTER CAN CATCH ON FIRE IF YOU HAVE A LEAVES OR NEEDLES IN THERE AND THEN. GET UNDERNEATH YOUR ROOFING. OR IF YOU'RE ON FORTUNATE TO HAVE A FENCE AND THE FENCE ESSENTIALLY CUTS OUT CATCHES ON FIRE AGAIN FROM THE EMBERS AND THEN WICKS THE FIRE TO YOUR HOUSE. SO THESE ARE THESE ARE COMMON POINTS OF ENTRY. THE OTHER POINT OF ENTRY OR THESE EVENTS WHICH I WAS JUST TALKING ABOUT AND THIS IS -- FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE AND YOU CAN SEE THE EMBERS THEMSELVES -- COMING INSIDE THE HOUSE SO THAT'S A PICTURE SHOWING WHAT WOULD BE LIKE FROM EITHER GABLE AND DARRON UNDER EVEN AT THE DEPEND IF YOU STORE ANYTHING IN YOUR ATTIC. OF YOU'RE LIKELY TO HAVE A IN ACNE IT'S THE HOME PIECE BUT LET'S TALK ABOUT SORT OF WHAT'S ON ON THE BOOKS AROUND FORTY TWO NINETY ONE INDEFENSIBLE SPACE -- WE HAVE SORT OF TWO ZONES -- SOMETHING THAT YOU KNOW FARTHER AWAY THE REDUCED FEELS OWN FROM FOR THE PROPERTY LINE TWO OR TWO HUNDRED FEET -- AND THEN WE HAVE THE SKINNER DEFENSIBLE SPACE ZONE BUT THIS IS THE KIND OF MATERIAL SO WE'VE BEEN PRETTY PRODUCING AND YOU CAN SEE THAT THERE'S THIS NICE LITTLE -- SET OF FLOWERS OUTSIDE OUTSIDE THE HOUSE AND THAT GIVES THE PUBLIC A PERCEPTION THAT IT'S OKAY TO BE PUTTING VEGETATION RIGHT CLOSE UP TO THE HOUSE AND IT'S JUST IT'S JUST NOT NOT CORRECT -- HERE'S AN EXAMPLE FROM PARADISE -- THIS IS AMBER DAMAGE YOU CAN SEE THE EMBERS IN THE PALM OF THE HAND THAT'S LITTLE BITS OF COAL IT WERE IN THE LAWN -- THIS HOUSE PROBABLY WAS BUILT AROUND 200-010-2000 -- TWELVE THERE'S A CUSHION THAT SHOWS KIND OF THE THE LEVEL OF BURNING THAT HAPPENED AS THOSE NUMBERS WERE BEING THROWN AGAINST THAT HOUSE. MEMBERS CLEARLY CROSSED THIS LAWN AND YOU'VE GOT BLACK HERE AND THAT WAS ALL WITH -- COMBUSTIBLE MULCHES AND THEY WERE PLANTINGS THE HOUSE SURVIVED BUT EVERYONE OF THOSE WINDOWS IS CRACKED A AND THE FIRST PAIN HAS HAS HAS BROKEN -- THE GOOD NEWS IS THE HOUSE SURVIVED BUT HAD THEY NOT HAD THIS KIND OF COMBUSTIBLE MULCH AND VEGETATION PLANTED RIGHT UP AGAINST THE HOUSE I DON'T THINK THERE WOULD BE ANY DAMAGE TO THE HOME. EL AND HERE'S ANOTHER ILLUSTRATION FROM THE CAR FIRE AGAIN IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE THIS HOME WAS ANYWHERE NEAR A FIRE BUT THE FIRE TORNADO WAS CAME IN RIGHT BEHIND THIS HOUSE. AGAIN THE EMBERS WENT OVER THE LAWN AND HEAR SOME BOX WOULD AND AGAIN EACH OF THOSE WINDOWS IS BROKEN AS WELL -- SO IT WOULD BE NICE IF FOR GUIDANCE AND FOR HAD A MORE MAINSTREAM UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THIS WHAT THIS AREA IMMEDIATELY AROUND THE HOUSE. IS AND HOW IMPORTANT IT IS -- FOR HOME HARDENING AS WELL AS THE FENCE. SO THE MAIN MUCH METRIC HERE IS THAT WE'RE TRYING TO TEACH PEOPLE TO WORK FROM THE HOUSE OUTWARD AND TRYING TO BRING FOR THIS IDEA OF A NON COMBUSTIBLES ANSWERED IMMEDIATELY AROUND THE HOUSE -- TO PROVIDE GREATER GREATER GUIDANCE OVERALL -- AND I GUESS WITH THAT. I THINK ALL CONCLUDES SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU I WILL BE ON YANIS TEAM ANY DAY [inaudible] GREAT JOB. SO THANK YOU CHEERS ASSEMBLY MEMBERS -- AND MISTER JARED FOR THE INVITATION TO SPEAK TODAY. ARE YOU HAVE MY BIO SO I'VE BEEN INTRODUCED. AND COULD YOU PULL UP THE POWER POINT. SO WHILE OF WHAT HE DOES THAT. I'D LIKE TO START THE PRESENTATION WITH THREE POINTS THAT I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THROUGHOUT THE DAY PER THROUGHOUT THE CONVERSATION. THE FIRST IS THAT HOME HARDENING IS ONE OF THE MOST FINANCIALLY EFFECTIVE WAYS TO DEAL WITH WILD FIRE THREAT. SO HOME HARDENING IS AT THE CENTER OF HOW WE MIGHT MAKE INVESTMENTS FOR COMMUNITY RESILIENCY RELATIVE TO WILD FIRE. THE SECOND POINT IS THAT DOING SO IS GOING TO TAKE A TREMENDOUS LEVEL OF STATE AND LOCAL PARTNERSHIPS. IN ORDER TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN AND THE THIRD. I'D LIKE TO HAVE A SERIOUS CONVERSATION WITH YOU ABOUT HAZARD VERSUS RISK. BECAUSE THEY'RE DIFFERENT AND WE NEED TO MEASURE DIFFERENT THINGS IN ORDER TO KNOW HOW WE'RE DEALING WITH THIS ISSUE. SO THIS IS WHAT THE PROBLEM LOOKS LIKE FROM A NUMERICAL STANDPOINT RELATIVE TO COMMUNITY RESILIENCY HOME HARDENING AND WILDFIRES THIS IS HOW THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY. LOOKS AT CALIFORNIA. THEY LOOK AT IT IN A NUMBER OF WAYS THEY LOOK AT IT DOWN TO THE HOUSE LEVEL. BUT THIS IS HOW ON A STATEWIDE BASIS WE'RE LOOKING AT WHERE THE PROBLEMS OCCUR THE PERCENTAGES OF STRUCTURES IN PRIMARILY THOSE RURAL COUNTIES WHERE THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY THINGS ARE PROBLEMS THE WORST. THE ANALYSIS UP BY VERA SKI IS THERE ARE ROUGHLY TWO MILLION HOMES THAT ARE EXISTING HOUSING STOCK BUILT PRIOR TO THE TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT R. IMPACT OF THE BUILDING CODES. THAT WE HAVE AS A PROBLEM SETS SO I LIKE TO THINK OF THINGS ANALYTICALLY AND I APPROACH THIS QUESTION ABOUT HOME HARDENING FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF IT TO TWO MILLION HOUSE PROBLEM HOW WOULD WE APPROACH THAT. SO ANOTHER IMPORTANT FACTOR TO REMEMBER IS WE ARE ON A HARDENING TIMELINE THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME THAT PEOPLE HAVE SAT IN FRONT OF THE LEGISLATURE OR COMMISSIONS AND TALKED ABOUT THIS ISSUE. NINETEEN SIXTY FOUR PIERCY FORTY TWO NINETY ONE WAS CUED UP. THAT WAS DONE SO THAT HOUSE FIRES DID NOT IGNITE FORESTS BUT NOW ARE USING IT TO PROTECT COMMUNITIES FROM FOREST FIRES. NINETEEN NINETY ONE POST TUNNEL FIRE IN OAKLAND WE ENACTED AB A BASICALLY A BAN ON WOOD ROOFING IN THE BUILDING CODES AND THAT IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT THAT WAS THE PERIOD WHEN I WAS THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL WE ADOPTED THE WILDLAND URBAN INTERFACE BUILDING CODES. AND ITS COROLLARY CHAPTER IN THE CALIFORNIA FIRE CODE THROUGH THE BUILDING STANDARDS COMMISSION AND THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL'S OFFICE SO I WANT TO KIND OF CALL OUT SOME KUDOS TO THE BUILDING STANDARDS COMMISSION FOR BEING A CENTRAL PART. OF THIS ISSUE AND THE STATE'S BUILDING OFFICIALS. SO. CONCEPT NUMBER -- ONE POINT NUMBER ONE THAT I WANTED TO LEAVE YOU WITH A THE HARDENED HOME. IT IS BOTH THE BUILDING MATERIALS AND CONSTRUCTION TECHNIQUES IT'S THE MATERIALS AND HOW THEY ARE APPLIED TO THE STRUCTURE. AND DEFENSIBLE SPACE. BUT YOU MUST MAINTAIN IN ORDER TO HAVE A HARDEN HOME THE CODES THEMSELVES PRESUME THAT BOTH ARE PRESENT AND THE REASON THAT THE COACH PRESUME THAT IS. IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE DEFENSIBLE SPACE YOU HAVE TO BUILD NON COMBUSTIBLE BUILDINGS AND THE COST AND CAPABILITY FOR US TO BUILD THOSE TYPES OF STRUCTURES OUT THERE. IS VERY DIFFICULT TO ACHIEVE SO WE SAID THERE MUST BE BOTH DEFENSIBLE SPACE AND BILL IGNITION RESISTANT BUILDING MATERIALS FOR THIS TO SUCCEED AND WE ARE NOT YET SUCCESSFUL IN ENFORCING BOTH OF THOSE ASPECTS. THIS IS A A SLIDE FROM A GROUP THAT'S CURRENTLY AT WORK I'VE BEEN READING CALLED THE COMMUNITY PLANNING FOR ASSISTANCE FOR WILD FIRE -- YOU MIGHT HAVE READ SOME ARTICLES ABOUT THAT DIFFICULT TO SEE THE DIFFERENT ELEMENTS BUT AS A AS CHIEF RICH WINE MENTIONED SYSTEMATIC APPROACHES WITH A MULTIPLE OF DIFFERENT MEDICATIONS ARE NECESSARY FOR THIS. CERTAINLY LOCAL -- LOCAL GOVERNMENT HAS A VERY IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE LAND USE PLANNING BUT THE THE SUBDIVISION AND MAP. DESIGN GUIDELINES GENERAL PLAY. DO THE GENERAL PLANS EXCEPT A AND THE FORESTRY LAND MANAGEMENT AGENCIES UTILITIES WHO ARE -- KIND OF AT OUT THERE IN THE LARGER FOREST AREAS HAVE A ROLE. AND THEN THERE ARE THESE BUILDING AND HARDENED HOMES AND COMMUNITY RESILIENCY FEATURES SO. WE'RE GONNA TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT ONE COMPONENT. ROBERT I'M GOING TO ADDRESS A NUMBER OF THOSE FEATURES. HERE IN A MOMENT. SO IF YOU'RE PUTTING TOGETHER SOME KIND OF ACTION PLAN. AND AND YOU WERE LOOKING AT JUST WHAT ARE THOSE ELEMENTS THAT NEED IMPROVING RIGHT NOW. ONE OF THE CONCEPT IS. YOU NEED TO HAVE HARDENED COMMUNITY NEEDS MANY HARDENED HOMES SO RATHER THAN DOING A FEW HOMES IN A SCATTERED AREA YOU NEED TO HAVE A FOCAL POINT. OF WHAT WAS THE TERM YOU USED A SATURATION OF HARDENEDHOMES FOR IT TO WORK IN A COMMUNITY OTHERWISE. YOU ARE LIKELY TO BE WASTING YOUR TIME AND MONEY. SO YOU MUST PICK AREAS WHERE YOU CAN DO A LARGE SCALE CONVERSION OF HARDENED RETROFITTED STRUCTURES. ARE IN ORDER FOR THAT TO BE EFFECTIVE. THE OTHER IS AN EDUCATIONAL IN SUPPORT OF OFFICIALS -- YOU HEARD FROM AN EDUCATOR JUST A MOMENT AGO BUILDING OFFICIALS FIRE PREVENTION PERSONNEL DO NOT HAVE YET THE MATERIALS THAT EDUCATE THEM SPECIFICALLY ON THESE ISSUES SO I THINK WE NEED TO ENABLE THOSE COMMUNITIES WITH WITH CONSISTENT EDUCATIONAL GUIDELINES PROGRAM MATERIALS. AND HOW TO GET THAT MESSAGE OUT THERE AT THE PROFESSIONAL LEVEL BEFORE THEY TRANSLATED TO THE HOMEOWNER LEVEL. INVESTING IN RETROFITTING DEFENSIBLE SPACE THAT'S THE CORE OF OUR CONVERSATION TODAY INVESTING IN RESEARCH CALIFORNIA SPENDS AN ALARMINGLY LOAN AMOUNT OF FUNDS IN RESEARCHING THE MECHANISMS OF IGNITION AND BUILDINGS. WE COULD DO BETTER WITH THAT. WE NEED OPERATIONAL PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN STATE AND LOCALS AND THEN FINALLY WE NEED TO ASSESS BOTH HAZARD AND RISK. SO WHAT DO I MEAN BY THAT. WELL THERE ARE A NUMBER OF STATUTES IN AUTHORIZING PROVISIONS THAT REQUIRE OF THE ESTABLISHMENT A FIRE HAZARD SEVERITY ZONES I'M SURE YOU HAVE ALL SEEN THOSE MAPS. MANY OF THE LEGISLATION THE BUILDING CODES MANY THINGS ARE TIED TO THOSE FIRE HAZARD SEVERITIES ON MAPS AND AND I WILL. CALL OUT CAL FIRE DOES IN AN INCREDIBLE JOB THOSE ARE WORLD CLASS ASSESSMENTS OF FIRE HAZARD FOR CALIFORNIA. THEY DO. ABSOLUTELY WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO DO AND THAT IS IDENTIFY. THE PROBABILITY AND THE SEVERITY OF A FIRE OCCURRING IN A CERTAIN PORTION OF THE LANDSCAPE. IT TEN THOSE MAPS TELL US WE'RE THE PROBLEM EXISTS. THEY DO NOT TELL US WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT. THEY DO NOT MEASURE THE INVESTMENT THAT THEY WILL WE WILL BE MAKING FOR THAT HAZARD SO I WANT TO READ JUST A SECTION AND THIS IS OUT OF THE FIRE HAZARD SEVERITY ZONE -- NONTECHNICAL GUIDELINE. BUT IT SAYS AS REQUIRED BY LAW THE MODEL THE FIRE HAZARD MODEL. EVALUATES HAZARD AND NOT RISK HAZARD REFERS TO PHYSICAL CONDITIONS THAT CAUSE DAMAGE AND HAZARDOUS CALCULATED IN OUR MODEL IS BASED ON THE PHYSICAL CONDITIONS THAT GIVE A LIKELIHOOD. ABOUT WHERE FIRE WILL BURN IN THE FUTURE WILL PRODUCE WHEN IT BURNS AND THE PRODUCTION OF THE AMBER SPREAD AND IT WAS GROUND CUTTING WORK THAT THEY DID IN TWO THOUSAND AND MID TWO THOUSANDS. IN TERMS OF PREDICTING WHERE EMBER EXPOSURE WILL OCCUR IN COMMUNITIES. IT IS BASED ON THE POTENTIAL VEGETATION THAT WILL GROW IN THE AREA OVER THE NEXT THIRTY TO FIFTY YEARS VERY APPROPRIATE. RISK ON THE OTHER HAND IS THE POTENTIAL DAMAGE OF FIRE CAN DO TO THE VALUES AT RISK IN THAT AREA UNDER EXISTING AND FUTURE CONDITIONS. RISK DOES CONSIDER MODIFICATIONS THAT AFFECT THE SUSCEPTIBILITY OF PROPERTY DAMAGE. RISK INCLUDES DEFENSIBLE SPACE IRRIGATION SPRINKLERS AND BUILDING CONSTRUCTION THAT REDUCE THE RISK OF BURNING EMBERS IGNITING THE BUILDING. HAZARD DOES NOT EQUAL RISK BUT IT IS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN DETERMINING RISK. SO THE REASON I'M MAKING A POINT ABOUT THIS TODAY IS THE INSURANCE COMPANY EVALUATES RISK. WE ARE CURRENTLY EVALUATING HAZARD AND THEY ARE DIFFERENT. AND I THINK WE CAN HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW TO MOVE FORWARD BECAUSE CALIFORNIA NOW HAS. A MORE ROBUST CAPABILITY TO DO THAT TYPE OF EVALUATION CAL FIRE IS AN EXCELLENT PLACE TO CONSIDER DOING THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENT LOCAL FIRE SERVICE EXPERTS THE TECHNOLOGY IS AVAILABLE THERE ARE MANY THINGS THAT WEREN'T TEN YEARS AGO. THAT MIGHT MAKE THAT POSSIBLE TODAY AND I WANT TO GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE OF A COMMUNITY THAT HAS BEEN DOING THIS FOR FIFTEEN YEARS. THIS IS AN EXAMPLE FROM COLORADO SPRINGS COLORADO THAT IS THEIR FIRE HAZARD SEVERITY ZONE THAT THEY DO IN A MODELING PROCESS SIMILAR TO CAL FIRES AND WHAT THEIR MAP LOOKS LIKE WITHIN THEIR CITY BOUNDARIES. SHOULD LOOK VERY FAMILIAR TO US THOSE ARE THE RED ZONES THAT WE WORRY ABOUT AND ARE HIGH IN VERY HIGH FIRE HAZARD AREAS. THEY TOOK IT A STEP FURTHER THOUGH THEY TOOK IT DOWN TO THE STRUCTURE LEVEL. AND THEY STARTED TO SAY WELL WE KNOW WE'RE GOING TO HAVE PEOPLE LIVING IN THESE AREAS SO WHAT CAN WE INVEST IN AS A HOMEOWNER. AS A LOCAL GOVERNMENT AS A STATE OR FOR EDUCATION PARTNER WHAT CAN WE INVEST IN AND HOW DO WE MAKE THIS LOOK LIKE WHAT THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY IS DOING TO ASSESS OUR STRUCTURES. SO THEY WENT THROUGH A RISK ASSESSMENT. SO OVER LATE IN THAT SAME AREA THOSE ARE THE PARCELS THAT LIES UNDERNEATH THOSE FIRE HAZARD JONES. THEY WENT DOWN AND THEY SAID THERE ARE A NUMBER OF THINGS ABOUT EACH STRUCTURE THAT WE KNOW ARE IMPORTANT LIKE DEFENSIBLE SPACE. LIGHT BUILDING FEATURES ETCETERA ETCETERA WHAT IS THE FIRE JUST DEPARTMENT RESPONSE CAPABILITY IN THAT AREA AND THEY WENT OUT AND THEY CREATED AN ABILITY TO INTERACT WITH THE HOMEOWNER AND ASSESS THAT IF THE PARCEL LEVEL. SO FOR FIFTEEN YEARS THEY HAVE BEEN ON A PATH OF REDUCING RISK. UNDERNEATH THEIR SEVERE FIRE HAZARDS. AND CORRELATING THAT TO THEIR INSURANCE THEY ALSO HAVE A TAX MITIGATION OF PROGRAM FOR REIMBURSEMENT TO HOMEOWNERS TO HELP INCENTIVIZE THAT. AND I BELIEVE THAT'S MY LAST SLIDE IT IS. AND WHAT THAT DOES IS IT STARTS TO ALIGN THE TWO KEY FINANCIAL ISSUES WHICH IS DISASTER EXPENSE AND INSURANCE COSTS TRIED IT START TO ALIGN THEM TOWARD THE SAME SET OF GOALS. AND MOREOVER THIS IS A THIS IS ONE OF THE WAYS BY WHICH YOU CAN START TO NOW BUILD CONSISTENCY ACROSS THE STATE. A SINGLE RISK MODEL DEVELOPED BY THE EXPERTS THAT KNOW HOW TO DO THAT PARTNERED WITH BY LOCAL GOVERNMENT BUT WE CAN TAKE A LOOK AT HOW ARE INVESTMENTS COLLECTIVELY ARE MAKING A DIFFERENCE TEN YEARS FROM NOW WE CAN LOOK AT A VERY DIFFERENT MAP OF CALIFORNIA. ONE THAT SHOWS WHERE WE ARE LIVING IN A MUCH SAFER WAY. OTHERWISE WE'LL BE MARRIED TO JUST A HAS WHERE THE PROBLEM IS BUT NOT WHAT YOU HAVE DONE TO FIX IT. THANK YOU. I THANK YOU -- THOSE WERE TWO EXTREMELY INTERESTING PRESENTATION AND THAT PRESENTATIONS AND I'VE REALLY BEEN -- VERY HELPFUL TO ME AS I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT THESE ISSUES -- I HAVE INTRODUCED A BILL AB FIFTEEN SIXTEEN THAT DEALS WITH THE FIVE FOOT DISPENSED. DEFENSIBLE SPACE. ISSUE IN TRYING TO CLARIFY THAT AND AND TURN THAT INTO A REQUIREMENT ON IN OUR FIRE SEVERITY ZONE SO I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU ON THAT -- AND THE TOOLS THAT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT TO TRY TO HELP. INDIVIDUAL HOMEOWNERS AND PROPERTY OWNERS WITH HOME HARDENING. IS REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT AND SOMETHING THAT YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN GRAPPLING WITH HIS -- PARTICULARLY IN IN A LOT OF OUR URBAN AREAS WITH THE HOMES ARE VERY CLOSE TOGETHER THAT YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO DO MEANINGFUL LARGE DEFENSIBLE SPACE -- WORK YOU'VE GOT HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF HOMES IN THESE AREAS ARE MILLIONS OF HOMES IN THESE AREAS. SO HOW. TO TRY TO DEAL WITH THE HARDENING SIT IN. WHAT YOU WERE MENTIONING ABOUT SOME OF THESE PROGRAMS IN COLORADO SO I'M GOING TO ASK HALF TO SORT OF DRILL DOWN FOR ME INTO THAT SO THAT I CAN SEE IF THERE'S ANY -- TOOLS THERE THAT WE HAVEN'T EXPLORED IN CALIFORNIA THAT WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO YOU KNOW BRING ONLINE BECAUSE THAT WAS YOU KNOW REALLY REALLY INTERESTING TO HEAR WHAT THEY'VE BEEN WORKING ON AND I YOU KNOW I HAVE BEEN VERY WORRIED ABOUT. WHAT HAD WHAT'S HAPPENING IN A LOT OF THESE AREAS WITH INSURANCE COMPANIES -- BECAUSE THEY GO BY ZIP CODE REGARDLESS OF WHAT WE'RE PEOPLE MAY HAVE DONE ON THEIR INDIVIDUAL HOMES AND WHAT THEIR INDIVIDUAL RISK IS AND THEY CANCEL WIDE SWATHS OF PEOPLE'S INSURANCE WHICH IS. A REALLY NEGATIVE RESULT FOR THOSE COMMUNITIES IN THOSE THOSE HOMEOWNERS. SO IF THERE'S ANYBODY HERE FROM THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY IN THE ROOM ARE LISTENING I DO HOPE THAT YOU KNOW. THE THAT INDUSTRY IS WILLING TO SIT DOWN AND YOU KNOW WORK WITH US TO NOT ONLY MITIGATE THEIR OWN RISK AS UNDERWRITERS WITH TO HELPBRING POLICIES ONLINE THAT ENCOURAGE HOMEOWNERS. TO INVEST IN THIS WORK WITH THE PROMISE OF HAVING COVERAGE FROM INSURANCE COMPANIES AT THE END OF IT AND MAYBE EVEN REDUCE PREMIUMS AT THE END OF IT -- BUT WITHOUT THAT PIECE I I FEEL LIKE THIS IS NEVER GOING TO WORK -- FINANCIALLY FOR HOMEOWNERS -- I THESE ARE YOU KNOW THAT IS WELL IN MENTION THAT WE HAVE TO MEMBERS WHO HAVE JUST JOINED US ASSEMBLY MEMBER CRISTINA GARCIA. ASSEMBLY MEMBER DEVON MATHIS OF THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR FOR BEING HERE WITH US. STUFF ONE RIGHT NOW. THAT'S TOTALLY FINE OTHER OTHER COMMITTEE MEETINGS THAT ARE GOING ON I DO HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS -- THERE ARE -- HOMES THAT CERTAINLY THAT HAVE ADOPTED A LOT OF THESE REQUIREMENTS A LOT OF THE SUGGESTIONS WITH -- HOME HARDENING INDEFENSIBLE FACING THAT THEY STILL BURNED DOWN AND WHAT AND FOUGHT WELFARE IS THERE SOMETHING THAT WERE MISSING THAT'S NOT IN ANY OF THESE ARE KIND OF WHAT WHAT HAPPENS IN THOSE CASES OF THE FIRE SO EXTREME THERE'S REALLY NOTHING THAT CAN BE DONE OR DO YOU HAVE. ANYOTHER. THE IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE WE SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT. THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION THANK YOU FOR A FIRST ASKING AT I'M CURIOUS WHAT JAY IS GOING TO HAVE TO SAY FROM SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA -- WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT HAPPENED IN PARADISE AND PARADISE IS ONE OF THE BETTER ILLUSTRATIONS MOST OF THE HOMES THAT WERE BUILT IN THE SANTA ROSA AREA WERE BUILT PRIOR TO THE TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT CHANGING CODE SO THERE'S NOT A LOT TO LEARN FROM HOW THE NEW. CODE TO PERFORMING THERE THERE ARE SOME AND IN READING -- AS I SAID OF THE HUNDRED OR SO HOMES THAT WERE BUILT IN PARADISE TWENTY FIVE OF THEM SURVIVED SO. NOT A GREAT ODD -- BUT THE QUESTION ONE DISCRETE NEIGHBORHOOD THEY'RE DISPERSED AND SO -- MY HUNCH AND WERE WERE TRYING TO GET INTO THE DATA AND FIGURE THIS OUT IS THAT THEY PROBABLY HAD REDUCE SET BACKS AND SAID THEY WERE INFILL. MEANING THAT THERE ARE CLOSER HOMES TO THEM SO THE CONDITION OF YOUR NEIGHBOR'S HOME CAN OVERWHELM YOUR HOME IF IT'S NOT UP TO PAR -- SO YOU CAN YOU CAN HAVE SOME YOU KNOW AMELIORATING A FAX OF THE SURROUNDING CONDITION THAT COULD MAKE A MAKE A DIFFERENCE ON YOUR OWN HOME SURVIVAL -- YOU KNOW THE THE QUESTION IS YOU KNOW IS IT ARE THESE RETROFITS EXPENSIVE ARE THESE BUILDING CODES EXPENSIVE -- YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE STARTING A NEW CONSTRUCTION IS ABOUT A 5% ADDITION OTHERS A NEW RESEARCH REPORT THAT CAME OUT WITH FROM HEADWATERS ECONOMICS THAT SAID YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE STARTING A NEW CONSTRUCTION THE MEETING THESE CODE STANDARDS IS NOT REALLY A HUGE. HUGE A BURDEN TO BEAR IF YOU'RE DEALING WITH RETROFITS WERE YOUR HOW YOUR ROOF IS IN BAD SHAPE THAT OF COURSE IT'S MORE EXPENSIVE -- PROPORTIONATELY BUT IF IT'S YOU JUST DEALING WITH VENTS AND OTHER SMALL DETAILS -- THEY'RE NOT OVERLY EXPENSIVE BUT IN THOSE SITUATIONS YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND WHETHER YOU'RE GOING TO BE HAVING DIRECT FLAME EXPOSURE OR WHETHER GONNA BE HAVING EMBERS OR SOME COMBINATION OF THE TWO AND SO% YOU KNOW. THERE'S SOME NEW WANTS TO THIS -- AND SO I THINK THAT THE CHALLENGES TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHERE THOSE HOMES ARE AND HOW THEY'RE SITUATED IN WHAT THEY'RE LIKELY TO FOR WHAT KIND OF EXPOSURE THEY'RE LIKELY TO FACE. SO AGAIN IF YOUR NEIGHBOR'S HOME IS IN POOR SHAPE IT'S LIKELY TO CATCH ON FIRE AND THEN BECAUSE A LOT OF OF RADIANT HEAT EXPOSURE. CATCHES ON FIRE NEW ONES. IF YOU'RE AN INDIVIDUAL HOMEOWNER WHERE DO YOU FIND. INFORMATION ABOUT IF YOU HAD. SO MONEY INVESTED BUT WE'RE THE BEST PLACE WOULD BE TO INVEST THAT TO HEART IN YOUR OWN HOME IS THERE. TO LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENTS COME OUT AND HELP PEOPLE WITH THAT IS THERE SOME. AMAZING WEBSITE THAT TELLS PEOPLE YOU WANT TO BUY THIS KIND OF SCREEN FOR THIS KIND OF SUBJECT HOW WOULD PEOPLE EVEN BEGIN TO HARD IN THEIR OWN HOMES OR TO FIND THAT INFORMATION ALL TO START WITHIN THE OFFICE OF THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL HAS. THE POSTINGS AS TO WHAT THE APPROVED MATERIALS ARE. THE BEST WEBSITE AT THIS POINT IS REALLY THE INSURANCE BUSINESS SUIT FOR BUSINESS AND HOME SAFETY -- WHICH HAS THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE MATERIALS THERE THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA WERE PRETTY THIN STAFFED IN THIS AREA BUT WE'RE TRYING TO MODIFY A AND BUILD NEW WEBSITES A NEW MATERIALS TO BE ABLE TO BRING THAT UP TO SPEED WE'VE GOT MATERIALS BUT THERE. BUT THEIR JUST NEEDS MORE WORK AND INVESTMENT ON IT I DON'T THERE'S OTHER SOURCES YOU WANT TO BRING INTO NOT. SHE MENTIONED THE TWO BEST SOURCES THAT ARE OUT THERE THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL'S OFFICE DOES HAVE MATERIALS THAT ARE I'D. A GENERAL AND GUIDELINES AND THEN THE INSTITUTE SAFE ENOUGH THAT BUSINESS AND HOME SAFETY ARE HAS -- HOMEOWNER ORIENTED MATERIALS BUT THOSE ARE NOT WIDELY. KNOWN WEBSITES -- BUT I DO WANT TO GO BACK TO YOUR QUESTION -- CHAIR AND AND JUST SPEAK UP FOR THIS PARTICULAR CONCERN. AND THAT IS. I COULD ASK RHETORICALLY IF ANYONE KNOWS THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT CALIFORNIA HAS SPENT ON RESEARCHING BUILDING IGNITION LOSS OR BUILDING LOSS IN WILDLAND URBAN INTERFACE FIRES. AND IF ANY OF YOU SAID I DON'T KNOW I WOULD COME BACK AND SAY ZERO IS IN TERMS OF WHAT I AM AWARE OF AS A STATE. WE HAVE NOT INVESTED AS A LINE ITEM BUDGET RESEARCH WE HAVE NOT FUNDED OUR ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS WE DO NOT HAVE A RESEARCH CENTER IN THIS STATE A CENTER OF EXCELLENCE FOR THIS ISSUE. WE DO NOT INVEST A SYSTEMIC RESEARCH PROGRAM FOR THIS PARTICULAR HAZARD AND I WOULD. SUGGEST THAT THAT IT'S TIME WE DID. THANK YOU THAT'S A EXCELLENT POINT. IN TERMS OF THE THE FIVE FOOT OF DEFENSIBLE SPACE -- AS YOU SAID THIS IS SOMETHING THAT HOMEOWNERS PROPERTY OWNERS ARE VERY RELUCTANT TO DOPEOPLE LOVE THEIR GREEN SPACE PEOPLE WANT THE COOLING -- QUALITIES OF IT THEY WANT THE BUTTE AIR QUALITY -- THAT IT BRINGS -- AND YOU KNOW AS I TALKED ABOUT THE BILL THAT I'M INTRODUCING YOU KNOW I SAY TO MYSELF YOU KNOW THAT WE'RE GONNA BE GOING OUT AND TELLING PEOPLE TO CUT THEIR REPEAL GRANDMA'S ROSES DOWN. AND THIS IS GOING TO BE TOUGH. ARE THEIR PLANT MATERIALS THAT CAN BE PLANTED IN THAT FIVE FEET OR EVEN AGAINST A HOME. THAT ARE OKAY MEAN A COULD A SUCCULENT BE OKAY OR IS IT ANY FOLIAGE IS JUST GOING TO BE BAD AND I KNOW THAT THERE'S A SCALE BUT BUT IT'S AN IT'S AN INTERESTING QUESTION -- I TALK ABOUT RIGHT PLANT RIGHT PLACE -- AND YOU KNOW REALLY ANY PLANT WILL BURN UNDER THE RIGHT CONDITIONS -- SO YOU KNOW UNDERSTANDING THE NATURE OF THE CHARACTERISTIC OF THE KIND OF PLANT YOU YOU WANT A PLAN WHERE YOU WANT TO PLANET -- I'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE A FRIEND WHO'S A LANDSCAPE CONTRACTOR WE'RE TRYING TO COME UP WITH SOME NICE NEW VISUALS TO HELP ILLUSTRATE THIS SO THAT IT'S NOT SO -- A DAUNTING YOU KNOW IT'S REALLY IS A MORE THE PLANTINGS ARE YOU RIGHT NOW THE PLANTE'S GO UP AGAINST THE HOUSE THE WALKWAY GOES ON THE OUTSIDE OF THAT WILL IF YOU SWITCH IT -- YOU CAN YOU CAN ACHIEVE A LOT IN THAT -- YOU KNOW IT'S ABOUT MAINTENANCE YOU KNOW YOU THERE ISN'T A SILVER BULLET OF A PLANT THAT IS GOING TO GET YOU THROUGH -- EVERYTHING IS GOING TO TAKE MAINTENANCE SO WHAT I FIND IS A PEOPLE ARE RELUCTANT ONCE THEY UNDERSTAND THE ISSUES BUT WHEN THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT. WHAT THESE PLANS MAY BE CONTRIBUTING TO THAN THAN THEIR MORE PROTECTIVE OF THEM OVERALL THANKS MY LAST QUESTION FOR BOTH OF YOU IS? DO YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS ABOUT THE COURT THE COOPERATION AND COLLABORATION BETWEEN LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND STATE AGENCIES AT THIS POINT IS THERE ANYTHING THAT WE NEED TO SHORE UP IN TERMS OF AND TERMS OF THE COLLABORATION. SO YES I THINK THERE ARE SEVERAL THINGS -- ONE IS -- TO TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE FIRE SERVICE THROUGHOUT THE STATE IS A FAIRLY UNIFIED GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS AND DEPARTMENTS AND THEY HAVE LOTS OF WAYS OF OPERATING TOGETHER YOU'RE WELCOME TO YOUR WITH MUTUAL AID CONCEPT-- SO I DO THINK THAT. ARE MAKING SURE THAT YOUR LOCAL FIRE AGENCIES ARE AS INVOLVED IN THE DEFENSIBLE SPACE AND HOME HARDENING DISCUSSIONS. ARE AS CAL FIRE IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE OUT REACH OUT THERE IN THE COMMUNITIES ARM AND ARE WIDESPREAD IN NEED TO BE PART OF THAT SOLUTION AS WELL. AND INCLUDED IN NEED OF THOSE DISCUSSIONS AS WELL AS EDUCATED TOGETHER. OKAY BUT I WILL TURN TO MY CO CHAIR AND SEE IF HE HAS ANY QUESTIONS -- I'M JUST GOING TO TALK ABOUT OBSERVATIONS -- I HAD MANY FIRE ME TOO MANY -- AND MOBILE HOMES -- WHETHER ALSO CALLED MANUFACTURED HOMES -- THEY WIND UP LIKE TOOTHPICKS. ENDED MANY RETIRED PEOPLE PEOPLE ON A LIMITED INCOME LIVE IN THOSE -- HOMES AS WELL AS FAMILIES AND OTHER PEOPLE BUT THERE'S GOT TO BE SOMETHING BECAUSE WHOLE TRACKS WENT DOWN. A FEW INTERVIEW COUNTY. YOU'LL SEE IT. YOU WENT TO OF SANTA ROSA YOU'VE SEEN IT -- IT'S HARD TO BE AN INDUSTRY IN THAT INDUSTRY AND FOR ME TO BE POINTING FINGERS I'M NOT POINTING FINGERS I JUST THINK THAT WE NEED. TO RE EVALUATE SOME INCENTIVES FOR SOME PEOPLE TO GET SOME KIND OF UPGRADES TO THOSE BECAUSE MANY PEOPLE DO LIVE IN THEM. AND THERE WERE IN A HOUSING CRUNCH AND THE LAST THING I WANT TO DO IS TAKE THAT OPTION OFF THE TABLE. BUT IT'S SOMETHING I THINK WE AS A TEAM HERE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT HOW WE CAN -- ADDRESS THAT GOING FORWARD SO -- JUST AS AN OBSERVATION THAT WAS PROBABLY THE MOST OF THE HARDEST THING THAT I'VE SEEN BECAUSE MOST OF THOSE PEOPLE ARE UNINSURED. RETIRED. AND I DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY ARE. I ACTUALLY DO HAVE ONE OTHER QUESTION I FORGOT. DO YOU IS THERE A CONNECTION THAT YOU SEE BETWEEN. SORT OF BUILDING DENSITY IN THESE AREAS AND THE FIRE RISK OR AND I UNDERSTAND THAT IF ONE HOUSE IS NOT HARD IT'S CLOSE TO ANOTHER ONE THAT'S MADE FOR IT LET'S ASSUME THAT THEY'RE ALL. RELATIVELY NEW HOUSES -- IS THERE A PROBLEM WITH WITH. WITH THE DENSITY OR IS THE DATA JUST NOT CLEAR ON THAT. MY UNDERSTANDING FROM LARGER DATASETS IS THE PROXIMITY TO YOUR NEAREST HOUSE IS A HEAVY CONTRIBUTOR TO TO YOUR SURVIVAL IN GENERAL IF YOU LOOK AT COFFEE PARK FOR EXAMPLE MEAN THAT. THE DRUG PLANS BETWEEN THOSE HOUSES WITH LESS THAN FIVE FEET SO YOU KNOW THE AMOUNT OF EXPOSURE IS IS SIGNIFICANT. YOU KNOW ONCE YOU'VE GOT ONE HOME CAUGHT ON FIRE THAT IT'S IT'S IT'S EASY TO GET OVERWHELMED. I MEAN THESE ARE FUNDAMENTAL CHALLENGES OF HOW WE HOW WE DEAL WITH YOU KNOW HIGH DENSITY LIVING AND SMART LIVING AND I I DON'T HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS BUT I I THINK WE'VE GOT PEOPLE THAT ARE TRYING TO THINK ABOUT THESE THINGS IN A RESPONSIBLE WAY AND I APPRECIATE. YOUR CONSIDERATION TO THESE ISSUES. OKAY. WHAT ONCE AGAIN ON THE RESEARCH IS VERY LIMITED IN TERMS OF HOW WE ANALYZE THIS AND UNDERSTAND IT -- AND I WOULD SAY THAT KIND OF EXPERIENCE LEAVE MY GUESS IS THAT OUR ANSWERS ARE GOING TO LIE IN. IF YOU HAVE CREATED A HARDENED STRUCTURE AND ENFORCED DEFENSIBLE SPACE THE ANSWER IS BUILDING DENSITIES ARE SUPPORTABLE THE HIGHER DENSITIES ARE ACCEPTABLE. THAT'S FINE AND THEN AFTER A WHILE YOU IF THEY ARE THREATENING TO ONE ANOTHER IF THEY'RE COUPLE HUNDRED FEET APART THEY'RE NOT GOING TO IGNITE ONE ANOTHER. BUT BUT I KNOW THAT JUST WE KNOW WHERE WE'RE HEADED WITH OUR HOUSING NEEDS IN OUR DENSITY ISSUES -- I THINK THAT TAKING A LOOK AT HOW THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY IS TREATED -- WILL GO LARGE. WILL GO A LONG A LONG DISTANCE TOWARD. TOWARD ALLOWING THAT WITHOUT THREATENING ONE ANOTHER. GOT IT THANK YOU. ANYBODY ELSE ON THE COMMITTEE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS AT THIS POINT. SEEING NONE I'D LIKE TO THANK THE PANEL THAT WAS A REALLY -- VERY VERY HELPFUL THANK YOU SO MUCH. I'D LIKE THE BILL WILL COME UP THE A THIRD -- PANEL TODAY CHERYL AND ROOM I EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR RESOURCE CONSERVATION DISTRICT OF GREATER SAN DIEGO. J.

SORRY DIVISION NINE OTHER RESOURCE CODES -- WE ARE LOCALLY GOVERNED. AGENCIES WITH LOCALLY APPOINTED -- ELECTIVE BOARD OF TO WE'RE NON REGULATORY AS I MENTIONED.

AND IN NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN THE RESOURCE CONSERVATION DISTRICT GOT TOGETHER WITH STATE LOCAL FEDERAL AND TRIBAL FIRE AGENCIES. TO DEVELOPED. A FIRE SAFE COUNCIL TO HELP. COMBAT THE PROBLEM SAID SAN DIEGO WAS HAVING WITH WILD FIRES -- NOT SURE. WELL WE CALLED THE THE FIRE SAFE COUNCILS WE'VE HELPED TO ESTABLISH AND DEVELOP THIRTY EIGHT LOCAL FIRE SAFE COUNCILS WITHIN OUR COMMUNITIES. WE CALL THEM THE NEIGHBOR HOOD WATCH OF KEEPING SAN DIEGO FIRE SAFE. WE OPERATE MOSTLY -- GRANTS CURRENTLY WE ARE RUNNING APPROXIMATELY SEVEN FIRE GRANTS -- TO THE TUNE OF ABOUT THREE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. AND OUR PROGRAMS INCLUDE CHIPPING. WHICH IS COMMUNITY CHIPPING ALSO PRIVATE. CHIPPING. OF WHEN CAL FIRE DOES THEIR MANDATORY DEFENSIBLE SPACE INSPECTIONS OFTEN THEY WILL HAND OUT OUR OUR CARDS.

EVERY YEAR DEVELOP -- WE HAVE BI MONTHLY MEETINGS. IN WHICH OUR EXECUTIVE BOARD WHO IS COMPRISED OF THE FIRE AGENCY PARTNERS AN INSURANCE. AGENCY PARTNER ARE OUR CD AND A MEMBER AT LARGE. OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE MEETS BàN KIND OF OVERSEAS AND WATCHES WHAT THE RCD IS DOING IN THE MANAGEMENT OF THESE PROGRAMS. THAT WE MEET WITH THE LOCAL FIRE SAFE COUNCILS AND IT'S A PHENOMENAL EXPERIENCE FOR EVERYONE TO GET TOGETHER. TO EXCHANGE INFORMATION SUIT. WHAT'S NEW WITHIN THE COMMUNITIES WHAT THEIR ISSUES ARE HOW THE AGENCIES MIGHT BE ABLE TO HELP THEM. AND IT'S BEEN VERY PROACTIVE IN NOVEMBER WE HAVE SET ASIDE -- WORKSHOPS FOR EIGHTIES OR COMMUNITIES THAT ALREADY HAVE A C. W. PPV PLAN COMMUNITY WHILE FIRE PROTECTION PLAN. TO UPDATE THEM. AND THE IT'S IT'S JUST BEEN A GREAT IN A REACTION. WE HAVE HAD ALSO SOME. NEW PROGRAMS THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE WORKING ON ALONG WITH THEIR DEFENSIBLE SPACE WE ALSO DO OUT REGION EDUCATION. AND THAT COMES INTO. CREATING DEFENSIBLE SPACE HOW YOU CAN DO IT WITHIN YOUR COMMUNITY -- WE ARE ALSO WORKING ON HOME HARDENING [inaudible] ISSUES OF AMBER CHANGING VANCE OR ONE OF THE BEST THINGS YOU CAN DO TO HELP PROTECT YOUR PROPERTY. SO WE HAVEWORKSHOPS THAT WILL HELP PROPERTY OWNERS PUT IN LANDSCAPING. IN THE PROPER. AT THE RIGHT PLANT FOR THE RIGHT PLACE -- WHAT YOU CAN DO TO HELP PROTECT YOUR HOME [inaudible] AND THAT HAS BEEN VERY POPULAR WE ALSO HAVE A CLASS THAT IS CALLED. A WILDFIRE BEHAVIOR IN THE WILLIE. AND WHAT IT'S LIMITED TO ABOUT THIRTY COMMUNITY. MEMBERS. BUT IT'S A CAL FIRE PROGRAM THAT OUR FIRE CHIEF. TEACHES. THAT WAS CONDENSED INTO AN EIGHT HOUR PROGRAM BUT IT WILL REALLY HELP COMMUNITIES. LOOK AT HOW. TO PROTECT THEIR PROPERTIES. IN CASE OF A WILDFIRE HOW THEY NEED TO EVACUATE HOW FIRES GOING TO BEHAVE. AND THAT IS A VERY POPULAR -- CLASS WITHIN -- ARE -- FIRES ACCOUNTS THINGS THAT WE'RE NOW WORKING ON WITH OUR FIRE SAFE COUNCIL IS THAT -- TO DEVELOP A REGIONAL FIRE PIT. PROTECTION PLAN WITHIN THE COMMUNITY. AND SO. OUR BOARD. AND THE MEMBERS THAT ARE WORKING ON THIS WITH THIS. CONSISTS OF CALIFORNICA SMALL FOREST. A US FISH AND WILDLIFE SERVICE'S SAN DIEGO COUNTY FIRE THIRTY IN SAN DIEGO CITY. SO WE ARE GETTING ALL OF OUR MAJOR PLAYERS WITHIN THE FIRE ARENA TO THE TABLE TO WORK TOGETHER AND EACH. TO EACH DEPARTMENT SO TO SPEAK HAS A MAJOR. AREA OF CONCERN HOW DO WE COORDINATE THESE INTO ONE COHESIVE PLAN. WHERE WE CAN START TACKLING PROJECTS? THAT'S ONE OF OUR MAIN -- GOALS THIS COMING YEAR PLUS ALSO WORKING HARD ON DEVELOPING MORE RESILIENT COMMUNITIES WITHIN OUR AREA [inaudible] OF I THINK I PROBABLY TAKEN QUITE A BIT OF TIME ALREADY THANK YOU -- WHO WANTS? TO THE TOPS OF SURE. SO -- I AM A A FIREFIGHTER. BUT I'M GOING TO TALK AS A HOMEOWNER. THAT HAS HAD KIND OF A UNIQUE EXPERIENCE AND KIND OF APPROACH THIS LOW DIFFERENTLY THAN WHAT HAS BEEN DONE THUS FAR. SO -- TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN I MOVED TO NAPA COUNTY -- HAZARD AREA AND WENT DOWN TO MY LOCAL FIRE STATION AND SAID. CAN YOU COME BY AND LOOK AT MY PROPERTY AND TELL ME HOW I CAN MAKE IT A SAFER PIECE OF PROPERTY. IN A CIVIL BECOME A FIREFIGHTER YOU CAN FIGURE IT OUT FOR YOURSELF. AND THAT'S AN EXAGGERATION -- SO I DID AND I GRADUATED FROM FIRE ACADEMY IN TWO THOUSAND AND JUNE OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN IN MY VERY FIRST WILDLAND FIRE WAS ON OCTOBER EIGHTH. ENOUGH COUNTY FIRES AND IS SO I CAN TELL YOU THAT IS THE MOST INCREDIBLE WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE THAT IT WAS LIFE CHANGING FOR ME -- I I I LOVE BEING A FIREFIGHTER. WHAT A LOT MORE IS FIGURING OUT WAYS TO KEEP FIRES FROM HAPPENING? SO I LOOKED AROUND MY CHIEF IN BATTALION CHIEF SAID YOU KNOW GET ON TO A FIRE WISE -- THAT FIRE SAFE COUNCIL AND I DID. YOUR PART FIRE SAFE CANCEL MY START WORKING THROUGH THAT. IN A MONTH'S TIME WE WAIT REYES ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR FUEL MITIGATION -- AND TALK TO SOME LOCAL POLITICIANS THEY RECOMMENDED THAT I GET ON THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE IN CFF. I DID THAT AS WELL AND HERE I AM. AND WHAT I HAVE EXPERIENCED IN ENCOUNTERED. IS. A LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN SOME OF THE THINGS BEEN DESCRIBED HERE ICE I THINK THAT THERE ARE SOME WONDERFUL PROGRAMS IN PLACE. I THINK THAT THERE ARE IN PEOPLE. AND I THINK THAT THERE'S VERY LITTLE ODD CONNECTING UP DOT COM AND FROM A HOMEOWNER STANDPOINT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THAT THAT EXPERIENCE. BOOTS ON THE GROUND -- THE THE LEVEL OF INTEREST IN HARDENING HOMES AND UNDERSTANDING WHAT A DEFENSIBLE SPACES AND WE'VE GONE THROUGH SLIDES WE TALKED ABOUT IT HERE. AS A GROUP -- IMAGINE WHAT IT'S LIKE FOR THE AVERAGE HOMEOWNER. WHO DOESN'T UNDERSTAND HOW TO TAKE THAT PRETTY POSTER THAT THEY HAVE ON THE REFRIGERATOR WITH MAGNETS? AN ACTUAL I IS THAT INFORMATION TO WHAT DEFENSIBLE SPACES. AND THE INTEREST IS IS UNBELIEVABLE I MEAN PEOPLE ARE REALLY HUNGRY FOR INFORMATION PEOPLE REALLY WANT TO DO SOMETHING BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO MOVE OUT OF THE AREA. BUT I CAN TELL YOU THAT THAT'S THE CONVERSATION THAT I HEAR. THAT GO INTO I'M GOING IN THIS WEEKEND I'M GOING TO DO A PRESENTATION. FOR HOW FOR COMMUNITY OF SEVENTY HOMES. IN SOMEBODY'S LIVING ROOM POWER POINT PRESENTATION WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT HOW TO CREATE A FSC. IN THIS COMMUNITY AND EVERYBODY'S LIKE YOU KNOW MORE. AND THEY'RE SCARED. AND THE NAPA FIRES REALLY SURPRISED A LOT OF PEOPLE BUT THEY FIGURE WELL OKAY THE LITTLE THE LAST FIRE WE HAD IN THIS YEAR YOU IS THEY HENLEY FIRE I THINK THAT WAS LIKE SIXTY FOUR SIXTY SIX SOMETHING LIKE THAT. THE TUBS FIRE WAS ALMOST EXACTLY THE SAME PATTERN. AND IT WASN'T UNTIL THE PARADISE FIRE THAT REALLY REALIZE THIS IS THIS IS SERIOUS THIS IS THIS IS REAL THIS IS ACCIDENTAL. AND SO I THINK THAT WE'VE GOT TO FIND. WAYS -- TO MAY HELP THE AVERAGE HOMEOWNER AND ENDS THE THE THE MARSHALL. SAID THAT IN 85% OF THE 95% OF THE FIRES THAT START -- STARTED -- BY. PEOPLE. THAT'S TRUE. AND BIG BIG BEEN -- FIRES THAT MAKE THE HEADLINE NEWS THAT ASIDE AS A FIREFIGHTER WHEN WE ROLL INTO A VEGETATION FIRE IT'S BECAUSE SOMEONE WITH CUTTING THE GRASS AND AND THE BLADE SPARKED IN SOMETHING LIKE THAT. THAT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THESE HUGE CATASTROPHIC FIRES AGAIN JUST BE THE VET FIRES THAT WE SEE IN AND OUT. DAY IN DAY OUT [inaudible] THE THE PROBLEM THOUGH IS THAT THESE PEOPLE ARE NOT UNDERSTANDING HOW. TO ACTUALIZE THE INFORMATION THAT IS READILY AVAILABLE TO THEM. AND THAT FIRE SAFE COUNCILS ARE A WONDERFUL WONDERFUL WAY TO DO THAT WE CREATE A COMMUNITY -- WE PULL PEOPLE IN WE GET A HOLD OF THEIR NAMES THEIR EMAILS OR PHONE NUMBERS. WE WE WE WERE HAVING -- ONE IN MY COMMUNITY AND IN RIGHT BEFORE FIRE SEASON STARTS AND WE'RE GOING THAT HAVE THE FIRE MARSHAL COLM MEMBER GOING TO HAVE THAT FIRE CHIEF COME IN THE BATTALION CHIEF FOR CAN HAVE THEIR SHARE OF MAY I GO INTO THESE PEOPLE'S HOMES AND I SAID ARE YOU REALLY. DO YOU REALIZE. THAT THERE IS NOW A EVACUATION HIGH LOW SIREN THAT THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT WILL UTILIZE IN WHEN YOU HEAR IT. YOU GET OUT OF DODGE AND EVERYTHING NINE NEVER. THAT'S SCARY. N. SO -- IT'S IT HAPPENS. OKAY. SO WE CAN WE CAN WE CAN FIX THAT BY A BY REALLY EMPHASIZING THE FS SEASON WHAT WE'RE DOING AT THE NC FF. BUT IT IT CAN'T BE AS CLUMSY AS IT IS IN TERMS OF GETTING HOLD OF MONEY. AND IT CAN'T BE THE LITTLE DOLLARS THAT WE'RE SEEING -- COME IN THAT YOU KNOW WE WE HAVE FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS THAT WE HAVE COMING IN TO DO FILL MITIGATION AND WE WILL SEE THAT IN THE TWENTY TWENTY FIRE SEASON. WE WANT TO HOLD A COMMUNITY MEETING. WE WANT TO HAVE THESE PEOPLE COME IN AND WE'RE TRYING TO RAISE FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS. AND WE CAN GET THAT -- BUT WE HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE PROCESS OF FUND RAISING AND MAIL PANCAKE BREAKFASTS AND AND THAT SORT OF THING AND THAT IS NOT -- IF YOU HAVE IT YOU HAVE 95% OF THE FIRE STARTING WITH THE PEOPLE THEY'RE GONNA SHOW OF THESE MEETINGS. THAN THAT THE THAT THE EMPHASIS NEEDS TO BE ON THOSE MEETINGS AND WHAT IS THE KIND TO IT IT'S THE FST. THANK YOU YOU REALLY HIT SOME SPOTS FOR ME BUT WE'LL LET MISTER LOPEZ NEXT AND HUSBAND. ON IN A SECOND THANK YOU. THANK YOU VOTE MADAMS -- CHAIRS THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MISTER JARRETT THANK YOU FOR THE POTENTIAL BEING HERE COMMON FLIGHT FROM LA TODAY TO BE HERE WITH YOU GUYS TODAY. I GIVE YOU SOME IDEA WHAT THE DEFENSIBLE SPACE LOS ANGELES COUNTY SO DEFENSIBLE SPACE -- BACK THEN CALLED PORSCHE CLEARANCE IS STARTING SUCH A DISCOUNT IN NINETEEN FIFTY THE FIRST DOCUMENT THAT WE GOT. BACK TO FIFTY FOUR IT WAS MENTIONED -- HOWEVER THERE WAS A RECOMMENDATION SUCH A TIME THEY BEGIN MANDATORIES IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES BASED ON THE STATE CODES -- FORTY TWO NINETY ONE FORTY TWO NINETY AND THE LA COUNTY FIRE DEPARTMENT -- SERVICE THAT THE ONLY CORPORATE. AREAS OF LOS ANGELES COUNTY PLUS FIFTY NINE INCORPORATED CITIES AT THAT WEEK -- DO THE SAME FIRE PREVENTION PROJECTS WITH THEM HAMPER PIPER OF PROTECTION WELL WITH THEM. UP ENFORCEMENT PART OF THE DEFENSIBLE SPACE OF LOS ANGELES COUNTY WE HAVE THE KIND OF THE THE DEFENSIBLE SPACE INSPECTION PROGRAM -- WITH THIS IS A JOINT PROGRAM BETWEEN THE FIRE DEPARTMENT AND THE AGRICULTURE COMMISSIONERS OFFICE. WITH THE FIRE DEPARTMENT -- INSPECTS THE IMPROVE PROPERTIES THE GONNA ACOSTA COMMISSION OFFICE INSPECT THE AYE CHASTENED BAKER ALLOWANCE TO DOSE IN IMPROVE PROPERTIES. SO THAT THE LATTER ARE OF US LIKE TO POLITICAL NINETY SOME IS -- DEFENSIBLE SPACE ART THERE WILL BE SUFFICIENT WHEN IT TO HAVE A ALSO INSPECT AND MAKE SURE THAT THE NEIGHBOR DOLLARS THE THIRTY TWO BRIDGES THE FIRE HAS A FOUR DOT NEIGHBOR. THAT PUT THE HOME SO CLOSE TO THE PROPERTY LINE. UP SO WE DID THAT WE LA COUNTY SPECS ABOUT THIS YEAR WE'RE GONNA SPEC 510-007-0090. SEVEN OF OF HOMES. ARE AND BE ABLE TO COACH A COMMISSIONER WITH SPECTRUM TO ABOUT THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND BACON. ALONSO ADJACENT TO THAT -- AND WE DO THAT ANNUALLY OF WITH THE COUNTY BECAUSE A DECLARATION LISTS SO EACH PARCEL IS PROPERTY OWNER GETS A DECLARATION CARTOONS -- AND NOTICE AND EARLY FEBRUARY LET HIM KNOW THAT WILL BE BACK IN THE MIDDLE LATE SPRING TO DO AN INSPECTION SAID THERE ONE SECOND THERE WE GIVE THEM A DEADLINE WHAT THE DEADLINE IS A PLACE. WILL FOLLOW WHEN INSPECTIONS AND WE HAVE A NEW I DO NOT -- IT'S YES IN TECHNOLOGY WE USE IN A DECLARE PARTS OF ANALYSIS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE TOOK THE CORRECT PARCELS -- THAT NEEDS TO BE INSPECTED ARE THERE SOME PARCELS ARE CUT BECOME INDUSTRIAL HAVE BECOME COMMERCIAL AND WITH DOING SOME CHANGES AND THAT. I WANTED THE TECHNOLOGIES THAT WE USE AND TO DO THAT IS WORKING WITH CAL FIRE IN THE NEW DEFENSIBLE SPACE PROGRAM THAT THEY HAVE LUNCH AND THAT'S A WE DID A TEST LAST YEAR. WE'RE GOING TO USE THAT THIS YEAR WE HOPE TO IMPLEMENTED BY NEXT YEAR. THERE'S THE THINGS THAT CALPERS WITH THAT WITHOUT THAT SOFTWARE WILL ALLOW US TO NOT ONLY COLLECT INFORMATION ON THE VEGETATION AROUND HOME BUT A CONFIRMATION ON THE STRUCTURE ITSELF ON THE EXISTING STRUCTURES. WHAT KIND OF ROOF WHAT KIND OF FENCE WHAT KIND OF SITE IN THE HOUSE? AND THE SAME TIME WE CAN SEE WHAT KIND OF DEFENSIBLE SPACE. AS YOU CAN TO COVER HER FROM THE OTHER SPEAKERS. ARE DEFENSIBLE SPACE A COMPREHENSIVE -- OF MEASURE SO WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'LL BOTH GET TOGETHER SO WE WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH CAL FIRE TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN. FIT FINISH IT UP THIS YEAR ON AND KEEP WORKING ON NEXT YEAR TO WORK WITH THEM. TO HAVE THAT VEGETATION AND STRUCTURE OF COURSE -- DATA. IT STARTED BUILDING IT UP OF THE SURF TWO REASONS ONE IS TO HELP. HELP US HELD THE PROPERTY OWNER TO MAKE A HOME SAFER BUT IN CASE SOMETHING HAPPENS ALSO WE CUPS WE KNOW WHAT HAPPENED OR WHAT IT WAS THERE BEFORE THE FIRE CAME. ON TO SOMETHING DID BURN WHY COULD HAVE BEEN THE REASON THAT APART BUT IT DIDN'T BURN WHY DID THEIR NUMBER SO WE GOT TO STUDY THE THE THE HEALTHY. AND THE ON HEALTH -- BUT I THINK THAT WE DO -- AND INSPECTION WORLD BUT IS NOT REALLY SPECTRUM IS A COOPERATIVE PROGRAM THAT WOULD DO THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON. WE CALLED I AM -- POLICE THEMSELVES AND WE GO OUT THERE INVEST INSPECT UP -- POLLS AND LINES WITH THE PERSON WAS GOING TO BE DONE THE WORK OF WE KEEP TRACK OF THAT AND THEN WE FOLLOW UP AGAIN IS NOT AN INSPECTION TO CYCLE OPERATION. BUT THEN WE TRIED WE ASSIST. US IN CALIFORNIA EDISON TO THE WORK AND I THINK THAT IT HELP ANSWER THIS BACHELORS OPENS A LOT OF THE WORKS. ARE AND SOMETIMES YOU HAVE A BIG EUCALYPTUS THREE THAT IS RIGHT NEXT TO A LINE. AND THEN IS TO BE GONE WE CAN WORK WITH EDISON'S TO THE PROPERTY OWNER WANTS HAD GONE. AN EDISON. IS JUST DOING ALL THAT MAIN AS WE ASSESS ON THAT COLLABORATION BETWEEN THE TWO SO THAT. OUR SELECTION AND IF IT'S SOMETHING IS GOING TO BE PLANTED IN THERE WE CAN ASSESS THE PROPERTY OWNER WHAT TO PLANT THAT IS NOT GOING TO AFFECT THE POWER LINES SO THAT'S ONE OF SOLUTIONS THAT WE GOT. AND I THINK THAT WE KIND OF IN THE COUNT IS WHAT WE CALL THE FUEL MODIFICATION BLUNDER VIEW. SO YOU HAVE A NEW CONSTRUCTION FOR A TO REMODEL THERE'S MORE THAN 50% OF THE SQUARE FOOTAGE OF THE HOME. YOU SUBMIT YOUR A LANDSCAPER PLANS TO US AND WE ARE REVIEWING. IS A CONDITION FOR A A OCCUPANCY AND WE'D NOT ONLY WORK WITH THE PROPERTY OWNER WITH THE PROPER SPACE IN -- AT ELATED ON THAT TASTIC ADDITION TO OUR PLAN. UP BUT IS THIS REVIEW IN THE LANDSCAPE IN AND I'M. MAKING SURE THAT THE PROPERTY OWNERS. ARE UNDERSTAND WHAT. PROPER SPACING AND PROPER -- PLAN SELECTION WILL DO WE DO NOT HAVE A FIRE FOR SYSTEM PLAN LISTS -- BECAUSE IS WE'VE REALLY. PUT ATTENTION ON MAINTENANCE. WHAT THE SPACE AND ON THE LOCATION OF THE PLANET'S RELATIONSHIP TO THE HOME AND NOT ONLY THE HOME ITSELF OF THE HOME FISHERIES THEMSELVES WINDOWS AND THINGS LIKE THAT WITH THE? CAUSE OF FIRES GOING TO FIND A LIST PATH OF RESISTANCE OR START WHAT -- WHAT CAN THEY WENT TO THE CALL AND SO WE'VE WORKED REALLY HARD WITH THEM ONCE THEY GET ALL THAT DONE WITH SUSPECT THEM EVERY YEAR THEY BECOME PART OF THIS FIFTH DEFENSIBLE SPACE INSPECTION? I MAKE SURE THAT THE LANDSCAPING IS NOT MODIFIED IT IN THE SUBSEQUENT YEARS -- ANYONE IN ADDITION TO DOING THIS WORK WITH THEM -- ACOSTA BE THE EDUCATION SO WE CAUGHT SEVERAL PROBLEMS THAT WOULD DO A DEFENSIBLE SPACE EDUCATION -- SAFETY IS A CONTACT SPORT SO YOU HAVE TO GO AND SPEND TIME WITH A A WOULD YOU FIRES THE COUNCIL'S -- AND ONE OF THINGS THAT WE WORKING REAL HARD RIGHT NOW IS THAT IS THAT. OF UP DEFENSIBLE SPACES THAT RELATES TO THE DOSE ORNAMENTAL PLANTS THAT WE TEND NOT TO OVER THAT WE WE CANNOT MAKE THE STATE FREEWAYS SAFER. ACTUALLY RECEIVED IN THIS BILL LIMITS SUCH ARE GOING UP BUT WE CAN MAKE THE CAR SICK FOR SO WE CAN TAKE THAT CONSERVE ON BRING IT TO THE HOMES HIMSELF SIDE YOU HER SOME SOME PREVIOUS. VENDOR SO WE WORK REALLY HARD AND GETTING THAT DONE WE COME UP ON MY SCHOOL MEET YOU FIRE INSPECTOR BECAUSE A LOT OF THE PEOPLE SAID YOU SENT ME THIS NOTICE EVERY YEAR. BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW THAT KNOW WHAT WOULD YOU TELL ME HERE HOW TO SUPPORT TO LOOK AT MY PROPERTY NOTHING DOES WHAT THEY SAY IS THAT. SO WE PUT AN EXAMPLE FOR REAL SO BRING THE LOCAL FIREFIGHTERS SO IS THERE IS A UNIFIED. UNDERSTANDING OR WHAT DEFENSIBLE SPACE LOOK LIKE WHICH YOU KNOW WE WE HAVE A PRESENTATION ALSO CALLED THE GOOD THE BAD AND THE UGLY. AND NOW WE WHICH I'M WHAT WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR AND I THINK THAT IT'S IMPORTANT WE ALSO DO HOME IGNITION TRAINING -- THEY'VE CALIFORNIA FAR TO CANCEL BEEN REALLY GENEROUS SO WE CUT DOWN ABOUT TWENTY A HOMING MISSION TRAINING FOR THE PROPERTY OWNERS THAT'S FOR IN WHICH THEY LEARN WHAT ARE THE CHARACTERISTICS THAT -- OR DO WHAT THEY NEED TO DO TO REDUCE THE FIRE HAS A TO THE CLUB IN THOSE FIRST A HUNDRED FEET. STARTING WITH THE HOME ITSELF AND AND WORK ON THE WAY OUT. AND THAT'S A VERY IMPORTANT THING TO DO AND WE ALSO RECOVERY VICE ALREADY SICKLE AND VIDEOS AND I WILL SEND A COPY TO MISTER JARRETT WHEN I'LL COME. TO AND THEY WOULD THINK THAT YOU US GOT YOUR MITCHELL LITERALLY MAY I IS THAT WHERE THE SOMEBODY FIND INFORMATION OF HOW TO BE MORE FAR SAFE. AND A GREAT WAY TO DO DIS BY CREATING A COMMUNITY WHILE FIVE PROTECTION PLAN THE CAMARO ABOUT FIVE BRITISH AND ESPECIALLY CUTTING A DEAL TO FIRE UP -- HOMING MISSION. THE QUALITY OF THE CALL MANY WELFARE PROTECTION PLAN IS TO BRING ALL THAT ARE COVERED IN A DOCUMENT. THAT IS COMMUNITY BASED ON IS AVAILABLE FOR THEM YOU WANNA CHANGE YOUR WINDOWS YOU GO TO THE FIRES. SAID THAT REPEAT TO SEE WHAT -- WHAT THE BEST WINDOWS DEFENSE OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT IS A GREAT DOCUMENT FOR YOU DID IT AT A ONE MORE THING THAT WE'RE DOING THAT WE'RE VERY PROUD TO DO IS THAT WE WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH THE CALIFORNIA CONSERVATION CORPS -- THE THE THE STATE RESPONSIBILITY RFR PREVENTION FUND WOULD HAVE DONE QUITE A BIT OF WORK IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY WITH THEM. IN ADDITIONAL WHAT THE FIRE SECONDS OF CAN DO THEMSELVES THE CCC CAN HELP US IN THIS THEIR RESPONSIBILITY TO THE WAR. A WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO WORK WITH THEM WITH THE OP CALM AND GRANTS PROGRAM THEY CáC CALIFORNIA CLIMB AND INVESTMENT FIVE PREVENTION -- GRANT PROGRAM ALSO WORKING WITH THEM BEEN VERY PRODUCTIVE TO US ABOUT THE WAY WE JUST HIRE A CORE MEMBER -- AT JOE'S IN NOVEMBER TO START WORKING WITH US AND JUST A GREAT SOURCE NOT ONLY THE WORK BUT THE PEOPLE THAT COME OUT OF THAT PROGRAM I JUST FANTASTIC. AND REPORT. GREAT THANK YOU I HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS -- SURE PROBABLY LORD AS AS WELL. I COULDN'T AGREE WITH YOU MORE ABOUT EDUCATION EDUCATION EDUCATION -- IT'S EASY TO SAY YOU DON'T KNOW BUT IF YOU HAVE THE INFORMATION OUT THERE AND OBVIOUSLY MEANT ALL OF YOU WERE DOING THAT I'M TRYING TO BUT THERE'S SO MANY PEOPLE OUT THERE THAT THEY DON'T WANT TO KNOW. MY REAL COMMUNITIES -- AS MANY TIMES AS A FIRE DEPARTMENT OR UTILITIES OR WHATEVER TRIES TO GO TO THEIR LAND. DOES THE PRIVATE PROPERTY AND THEN THAT THEY MAKE IT VERY DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE TO GO OUT THERE AND I THINK. WE'VE SEEN SOME OF THE RESULTS OF THAT FROM SOME OF THE FIRES. AND SO THE CHALLENGES IS THAT HOW DO WE GET THOSE PEOPLE TO GET ON BOARD THE SOME AT LEAST SOME DEFENSIBLE SPACE AND TO REALIZE THAT THEY'RE HARMING NOT ONLY. THEMSELVES BUT THEY'RE HARMING. OTHERS ALONG THE WAY SO -- YOU KNOW IT'S A IT'S A TOUGH ONE BERMAN AS WE KNOW IN -- OF THE CAMPFIRE WE WERE MISSING QUITE A FEW PEOPLE FOR QUITE SOME TIME. IT'S COULD THOUGHT OF THAT MANY OF THOSE PEOPLE DIDN'T WANT TO BE FOUND THEY LIVED UP IN THE HILLS AND YOU KNOW WHO KNOWS WHAT'S HAPPENED UP THERE BUT THE THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS I'M VERY CONCERNED ABOUT. HIS RURAL AREAS I MEAN I THINK YOU'RE DOING A REALLY GOOD JOB ANYMORE CUT CONCENTRATED URBAN AREAS. BUT I THINK THIS MISTER THOMPSON KNOWS IS IT SOME UP IN OUR AREAS UP IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO GET THAT EDUCATION. AND TO GET PEOPLE TO GET TOGETHER TO ACTUALLY HAVE THESE REALLY GOOD CONVERSATIONS OF PUTTING THESE GROUPS TOGETHER SO -- THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR SOME IDEAS THAT I PICKED UP HERE TODAY -- ALSO IS THAT I'M SURE YOU DO THIS BUT I'M HOPING THIS IS DONE IN MULTIPLE LANGUAGES -- WE CAME UP WITH THE FIRES THAT WE IT HAD THE IN OUR AREA WAS THAT WE HAD MANY PEOPLE THAT DIDN'T SPEAK ENGLISH. AND WE HAD A HARD TIME MAKING SURE IN IT WASN'T INTENTIONAL READ ALTHOUGH WE COMMUNICATE IN SPANISH BUT THERE IS MANY OTHER LANGUAGES THAT ARE OUT THERE. SO THAT -- AND DO YOU DO THAT CURRENTLY OR HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT NO ONE'S LEFT BEHIND ON SOME OF THESE EDUCATION TOOLS AND IF YOU ANSWER THAT IN A SECOND -- MAYES ABOUT RESPONSIBILITY. THERE'S A HOME OWNER OR PROPERTY OWNER THE LACK OF RUNS RESPONSIBILITY IT'S EASY TO POINT FINGERS AND AS YOU SAID IS BY THE PUBLIC -- EDUCATING PEOPLE TO EVEN LEARN HOW TO WALK INTO THE WALKING TRAILS. YOU MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE NOT TAKING EXTRA THINGS ALONG THE WAY I'VE SEEN IT WITNESS IT WENT TOO MANY TIMES THEY'LL SAY NO DO KNOW DOGS. AND WHAT HAPPENS EVERYONE'S GOT A DOG GOING ON THE WORKING TO THERE'S A REASON THOSE THINGS HAPPEN RIGHT. AND SO -- WE'RE NOT PROTECTING OUR NATURAL RESOURCES AS WELL AS WHEN PEOPLE ARE NOT BEING -- RESPONSIBLE AND HONOR OUR OPEN SPACE AND SO I'VE HAD THE LAST THING I'D EVER WANT TO DO DURING. IS TO CLOSE DOWN OPEN SPACE DURING FIRE SEASON FUHRMAN FOLLOW THE RULES WE WOULDN'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THAT SO I WOULD LIKE TO COMMENT THAT -- DOES IT IT'S IT IF YOU WERE TO ASK ME MY BATTALION CHIEF WHAT WERE THE TOP THREE THINGS THAT THEY SAW DURING THE TUBS FIRE. THAT WERE THE CAUSATION FOR A LOT OF STRUCTURE FIRES -- DAVID SAY. WOOD CHIPS AROUND THE PERIMETER OF THE HOME. HOME COMPUTER MARKET SOME PEOPLE CAUGHT THAT. AND THEN WOOD DECKS WITHOUT ANY SKIRTING EARNING PROTECTION OR ANYTHING AND THEN WE HOPE MORE KIND GRASS UNDERNEATH THE THE TEXAS OF WHAT. WE WE DID A INSPECTION OF COPY PARK. AS FIRE STATION RIGHT AFTER THE FIRES ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I SAW WAS THAT PEOPLE PARKED THERE -- PLASTIC. RECYCLE AND TRASH BINS RIGHT UP AGAINST THE HOUSE UNDERNEATH THE EAVES UNDERNEATH THE OVERHANG AND SO WHEN YOU START TALKING ABOUT EMBERS YOU HAVE TO START SAME OKAY WHEN THE EMBERS GET THERE. WHAT WHAT'S HAPPENING TO THEM? YOU KNOW GOING IN THE ATTIC LANDING ON THE WOOD CHIPS IN IN A LOT OF CASES THEY PLAN ON THESE PLASTIC BINS IN THOSE PLASTIC BINS. JUST GO OFF LIKE A ROMAN CANDLE UP THE SIDE OF THE WALL ENTER THE EAVES OF THE HOUSE AND THEN YOU'RE OFF TO THE RACES AND SO. I HAVE FOUND THROUGH OUR FSC THAT. THAT HAVING -- SOME VERY SIMPLE. TO DUES ACROSS THIS PRODUCT OFF THE LIST. PEOPLE ARE VERY RECEPTIVE THEY JUST FEEL COMPLETELY OVERWHELMED WHEN THEY SAY THEY GET ALL THIS INFORMATION AT ONCE AND THAT'S NOT WITHIN THE VERNACULAR THEY UNDERSTAND OR USED. TO HERE THEY DON'T HAVE THE MONEY TO DO IT. OR THEY WANT TO WRITE A CHECK AND HAVE SOME DO IT FOR THEM. AND IF 8095% OF THE FIRES A START BY HOMEOWNERS IN IN OUR CASE. FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS OF GRANT MONEY COMING IN HAS TO BE USED FOR COUNTY ROADS WE CAN'T USE IT FOR PRIVATE PROPERTIES. THERE'S A PROBLEM THERE YEAH WE CAN TAKE CARE THE EGRESS WE CAN TAKE CARE OF THE ZONES ON YOUR SIDE OF THE ROAD BUT WE CAN'T GET INTO PEOPLE'S PROPERTY WITH THAT MONEY AND THAT'S WHERE A LOT OF THESE PROBLEMS OCCUR. BUT I A CHAIR THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT COMMITTEE AND SO THESE ARE THE QUESTIONS THAT ARE GONNA BE COMING UP IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS BECAUSE WE'RE REALLY WORKING AT HOUSING AND REZONING IN. HOW YOU HOW YOU FACE SO SING SO WE HAVE A LOT? BETTER. THAT WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH SOON SO -- THANK YOU FOR THOSE COMMENTS I HAD TO SHOW -- IN NOVEMBER FOR OUR STATE ASSOCIATION I GET SO MANY CALLS FROM REPORTERS BACCHAE SAYING YOU KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING IN CENTRAL CALIFORNIA WHAT'S HAPPENING IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. HOW COME IT'S NOT HAPPENING IN SAN DIEGO? AND DURING THAT FOUR DAY CONFERENCE WE HAD THREE FIRES BREAKOUT. BUT I I'VE FRANKLY JUST TOLD HIM I SAID YOU KNOW IN THEIR DEFENSE. WE'VE BEEN GOING THROUGH THIS FOR A LOT LONGER. AND WE HAD TO GET BUSY AND WE HAD TO GET ORGANIZED AND WE HAD TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT AND WE DID -- ITO IT'S IT'S TERRIBLE TO SEE PEOPLE DYING BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW HOW TO EVACUATE THEY DON'T KNOW WHERE TO GO THEY DON'T KNOW WEARS A SAFE PLACE TO SHELTER -- THE ROADS ARE CLEARED THEY'RE JUST LOST AND IT'S IT'S A MATTER IT IS THAT OUT REACH IT IS THAT AT EDUCATION. AND I BELIEVE. YOU SAID IT EARLIER IT'S NOT A MATTER OF OF FIVE IF IT'S WHEN BUT IT'S I THINK IT'S GONE BEYOND THAT AT THIS POINT CALIFORNIA THEY USED TO SAY WE LIVE WITH EARTHQUAKES. EARTHQUAKES AREN'T THE PROBLEM IT'S WILD FIRE. AND SO. HAVING EDUCATION. TELLING PEOPLE LOOK YOU HAVE TO GET BUSY HONEST IT IT'S THE ONLY WAY YOU'RE GONNA SURVIVE YOUR PROPERTIES GOING TO SURVIVE AND YOU'RE GOING TO KEEP YOUR COMMUNITY SAFE. AND AGAIN YOU KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE BACK COUNTRY DON'T LIKE WHEN AN AGENCY COMES IN AND SAYS HERE. A MANY GIVE YOU A TICKET IF YOU DON'T DO THIS THEIR BACK THERE BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO BE REGULATED BUT YOU'VE GOT THAT PERFECT VEHICLE WITH THE FIRE SAFE COUNCIL OR IN OUR CD THAT RELATIONSHIP. TO GO IN AND BE THAT INTERFACE BETWEEN THE PRIVATE PROPERTY OWNER. AND THE AGENCY AND IT IS JUST WORKED VERY VERY SUCCESSFULLY. AND WE'RE ALWAYS WE'VE HELPED OTHER DEVELOPED FIRE SAFE COUNCILS MENDOCINO TA WHOLE -- ANYONE WHO WANTS ONE BUT THERE CRUCIAL AND ONCE YOU. START THAT STRUCTURE TO THEN YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO APPLY FOR THOSE GRANTS. THAT WILL FIND YOUR PROJECTS AND GRANTS CLEARING HOUSE CALIFORNIA FIRE SAFE COUNCIL -- THERE'S STAPLE WE'VE WORKED WITH THEM FOR YEARS R. C. W. PPV PLANETS ON THEIR WEBSITE I MEAN. THERE ARE WAYS TO SEE THAT HAPPEN OVERNIGHT YOU TO KNOW IT DIDN'T KNOW IT DIDN'T THAT WE STARTED IN. NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN THANK YOU ALL RIGHT ONE THING YOU JUST MENTIONED AND I JUST WANT TO THROW IT OUT THERE IS THAT. FIRE -- FORCED BUYERS AND IN URBAN AREAS I THINK WE SHOULD NOT FORGET. I THINK WE'RE EASILY FORGETTING IS THAT THERE COULD BE AN EARTHQUAKE AND THERE WILL BE FIRES YEAH. AND I THINK WE NEED TO PUT THAT IN OUR PLANS AS WELL IS AND THAT'S JUST NOT A A RURAL AREA OR OR OPEN SPACE AREA BUT IN OUR HEART OF OUR MAJOR CITIES. IS THAT WITH DURING IT ERIS QUAKE THE FIRES ARE GOING TO BE THE THING TO GET PEOPLETHE MOST. SO I THINK WE NEED TO REALLY HAVE THAT CONVERSATION AND WE'RE NOT HAVING IT AT LEAST -- WE DO RIGHT WHEN THE EARTHQUAKES HAPPEN THEN WE HAVE FOR A COUPLE MONTHS AND THEN GOES AWAY SO WE NEED TO MAKE SURE TO PUT THAT IN OUR PLANTS AS WELL. MAY I ANSWER YOUR QUESTION SO OF FIRE PREVENTION CAN BE. A AND YOU MAKE A GREAT POINT FIVE PREVENTION IS TO BE DISSECTED AND PROVIDE THE CORRECT INFORMATION FOR CIVIL CALL FIRE PROVIDE A VERY GOOD DATA. OF ACE OF WHAT THE REAL A FISA A CONDITION START. ARE -- A BECAUSE WE KEEP LEHMAN CIGARETTES AND CIGARETTES THE OUT OF THE WINDOW IS NOT THE ONE NUMBER -- ONE OF FIRE OF PREVENTION WORK IS YOU ONE OF THE BIG ONES -- ACTIVITIES HAPPENED DURING CAPTAINCY SENATE THINGS LAST ANOTHER ONE SO GET IN THE RIGHT SOURCE BUT ARE NOT ONLY IF OUR PROVINCIAL SUFFERS SILVER LAKE TO FIGHT MISSION. BUT ALSO FIRE PROPAGATION SO YOU WERE SPEAKING ABOUT WE JUST HAD A FIRE YOU GOT A JOB DOES THE FIRST PREVENTION THING IT IS BUT NOW THAT THE FIRE STARTED. NOW YOU KIND OF A BOYCOTT THE FIRES GOING TO PROVOKE A TO A COMMUNITY A YOU MADE SOME RECEIVE INFORMATION. THAT WE USE THE OF READY SET CALLED THE RIGHT A PART OF THE PREPARATION. AND AND WHAT HAPPENED AND ALL THE WAY TILL YOU CUT THE EVACUATE BECAUSE YOU TRIED TO DEAL WITH ALL AT THE SAME TIME IS GOING TO BE JUST TOO MUCH INFORMATION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. YOU OFFER YOUR PRESENTATIONS -- REALLY GREAT TO KIND OF DRILL DOWN INTO THE MORE LOCAL LEVEL WITH THIS PANEL SO THANK YOU I MEAN I ASKED TO FLOW BECAUSE A SIMILAR QUESTION I'VE BEEN ASKING WHICH IS WHETHER LA COUNTY. HAS ANY ASSISTANCE FOR LOW INCOME ELDERLY HOMEOWNERS ON OUR PROPERTY OWNERS -- WITH ANY OF THE FIRERESILIENCE YOUR DEFENSIBLE SPACE WORK. BUT THE BEST PLACE THAT NEVER THINK THAT WE CAN DO IS HELP AND GET ORGANIZED AS A FIRES CUTS. ON THE ONE AT THE FIRST THING WE DO IF WE HAVE A COMMAND IS CONCERNED -- WE GO OUT THERE MEET WITH THEM AND SEE IF THEY CAN GET ORGANIZED A FIVE SECOND SO HE'S VERY LITTLE AMOUNT OF MONEY FOR THEM BUT IT CAN GET ALL OF OUR SUPPORT BEHIND WHEN YOU SAY THEM WHO WHO IS THEM. ERIC A COMMUNITY -- IT'S A COMMON ENOUGH THAT IN OUR COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT HILLS A COMMUNITY IN A WAY TO HEAR -- IT DID. EIGHT ARE CONCERNED OF FIRE AND WOULD YOU LIKE TO BECOME A FIVE SECONDS. TO REASONS ONE IS NOT ALL THAT THE ABILITY FOR THEM TO BE SELF SUFFICIENT. UP OFFERS THE COUNCIL ALLOWS THE THE ARE ALLOW US. TO PASS THAT KNOWLEDGE AND ENCOURAGE THE COMMUNITY KNOWLEDGE AS A RELEASED A FIRE AT A WILDFIRE YOU COULD SEE TWO GREAT EXAMPLES RIGHT HERE. THE OTHER ONE IS ALSO ALLOWS THE COMMUNITY TO APPLY FOR GRANTS AND LASTLY A TO AVOID CONFLICT OF OR WHAT WE CALL -- IN A WE CAN I JUST HELP UP -- LIKE THE RECITAL WAS SAYING YOU'RE GONNA GO A TO A PRIVATE PROPERTY INTO THEIR WORK -- BUT WE CAN DO THAT WHAT THE CALM THAT. HELPS THE COMMUNITY. AND YOU WORK WITH -- CITIES ASWELL INDEPENDENT CITIES OR CITY SORT OF THEIR OWN FIRE DEPARTMENTS YES THE WAY WE CAUGHT IN A VERY CLOSELY. OF VERY CLOSELY WITH THE CITY'S OPPOSITE ENOUGH OF BURBANK -- UNTIL CITIES THAT ARE ADJACENT TO US WE WORK VERY CLOSELY OF BEVERLY HILLS. AND OF ALL OF YOU APPLIED FOR CAL FIRE GRANTS AND IF YOU HAVE A HOUSE THAT PROCESS TO FIND AT THAT PROCESSES. IS OUR AS SMOOTH APPLIED FOR QUITE A FEW. AND I REALIZED AFTER. NOT GETTING THE FIRST TWO THAT I NEED TO HAVE A A SERIOUS CONVERSATION WITH OUR CAL FIRE FORSTER. SO BASICALLY I SAID WHAT IS A PRIORITY AREA. FOR CAL FIRE IT WAS A SUNRISE FEEL BREAK WHICH IS A REAL CRITICAL FRUIT SHE'LL BREAK FOR SAN DIEGO COUNTY. SO CALIFORNIA TO WORK ON THE FIELD BREAK BUT THEY DON'T HAVE. THE ABILITY TO GET INTO THE PROPERTY THE PRIVATE PROPERTY THAT A BUT SAID. SO WE DIRECTED THOSE GRANT FUNDS TOWARDS THAT AND IT WAS AMAZING RIGHT NOW WE HAVE A TWO HUNDRED WAIT LIST IN WE'VE JUST GOT SOME GRANTS WILL COME AND THEN I'LL HAVE IS CHIPPING AWAY WITH THAT. BUT WE NEVER ADVERTISE FOR CHIPPING PROGRAMS. WE ADVERTISE WE ONLY HAD A 30% RESPONSE FOR THAT COMMUNITY AFTER WE STARTED WORK WE SEND OUT ANOTHER AND WE HAD AN 85%. CHANCE AND WITHIN FOUR MONTHS WE HAD EXPENDED THE FUNDS. AND PEOPLE WERE CALLING TO SEE IF WE HAD MORE. SO. THE THE PROCESS ISN'T THAT DIFFICULT BUT I THINK YOUR BEST CHANCES OF SUCCESS ARE TO WORK WITH THEM. AND FIND PROJECTS THAT YOU CAN DO AS AND WE DON'T. A FIRE SAFE COUNCIL OR NURSERY DE THAT WILL HELP THEM MEET THEIR FIRE PLAN GOALS GREAT -- CHIEF -- WHAT WOULD YOU THINK THERE'S A BENEFIT TO INSPECTING DEFENSIBLE SPACE EVERY YEAR SUPPOSED EVERY THREE YEARS OR DO YOU THINK IT? DOESN'T MAKE AS MUCH MAKE THAT MUCH DIFFERENCE. OTHER SEVEN EFFORT TO CASSETTE OXIDE ARE OF INTEREST IS A CONTACT SPORT AND THAT DAYLIGHT TO US NOT COMMON AND WHAT NOT EVERYBODY. BUT A MAJORITY OF PEOPLE LIKE TO US TO COME EVERY YEAR AND PAY A VISIT AND SEE HOW THEY'RE DOING. AND THEY GET A CHANCE TO YOU KNOW TALK ABOUT THE NEIGHBOR WHAT THE NEIGHBORS TO AND ALL THAT -- AND ANY KEEP THAT RELATIONSHIP WITH THEM -- DEPTHFIRE PREVENTION OF THE PHYSICAL SPACES ALL YEAR ROUND PROCESS SO WE TRIED TO WORK WITH THEM. THROUGHOUT THE YEAR -- AT INCIRLIK CALIFORNIA IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT AND I CALIFORNIA CHOPPER ALL THE GRASSES ARE VERY CLOSE TO EACH OTHER SO WE CAN. WE CUT TO BE REALLY VIGILANT TO WILL HOW THEY INTERACT SO WE TRY TO KEEP THAT SEPARATION. WITHIN. THE LEGISLATION OF ROUND THE HOMES BUT ALSO THE VEGETATION WITHIN THAT SPACE THOUGHT ORNAMENTAL BUDGET TATIAN. THE TENTH TO GET AWAY A BOOK ON BILLY I CAN GROW CAN GROW REALLY FAST IN ONE YEAR. AND BECOME A REAL PROBLEM FOR US SO IT'S GOOD TO REMIND HIM YEAR. IS SIX IS A LOT OF WORK FIND OUT WHAT IT WAS WHAT JUST LIKE TO ADD THAT I THINK. THERE SHOULD BE MORE MONEY. I THINK THAT THAT. WE SHOULD NOT BE TALKING ABOUT SPENDING HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS FOR PREVENTION WHEN WE'RE SPENDING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO MOP UP. AND SO I THINK THERE THERE IS AN IMPASSE TO BE AN EXPERT IN THIS IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM BUT I I I I THINK YOU KNOW IF YOU KNOW HOW TO DO IT. AND YOU HAD A LOT OF EXPERIENCE WITH IT. THEN I THINK YOU CAN MANAGE GETTING THROUGH THE PROCESS OF GETTING GRANTS AND SO FORTH. BUT I I THINK GIVE THEM WHAT THE GRANTS CAN DO AND HOW IT LEVERAGES. THE THE THE THE THESE LOCAL COMMUNITIES SO THAT ALL THAT IS TAKEN OFF THE BACKS OF CAL FIRE TO THEIR NOT HAVING TO DO ALL THAT -- INSPECTION AND SO FORTH I THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE MORE EMPHASIS ON IT. THANK YOU I DON'T HAVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. I DON'T HAVE ANY OTHERS SAY WELL. YEAH I'D LIKE TO THANK ALL OF THE PANELISTS AND ALL OF THE MEMBERS WHO JOINED US TODAY -- THERE'S BEEN SEVERAL HEARINGS ABOUT WILDFIRES AND THEY'LL BE LOTS MORE BUT I FIND THAT EVERY TIME WE HAVE A DIFFERENT PANEL COME UP WE'RE WE WE HAVE NEW AN EXTREMELY VALUABLE INFORMATION -- AND WE'RE STARTING TO I MEAN I FEEL PERSONALLY LIKE I'M STARTING TO PUT PIECES OF A PUZZLE TOGETHER. SO THIS IS BEEN INCREDIBLY VALUABLE TO ME SO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SHARING YOUR TIME WITH US AND YOUR EXPERTISE VERY MUCH APPRECIATED BUT FOR HAVING US. WELL I'M SORRY. TO ANYBODY -- FOR PUBLIC PUMP COMMENT IF IF SO PLEASE COME IN LINE UP AT THE MICROPHONE. THANK YOU IF YOU CAN -- STATE YOUR NAMES PLEASE. MY ON THERE WE GO HI MY NAME'S TRACY CATTLEMEN ON THE NEW EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE CALIFORNIA FIRES A COUNCIL AND RECENTLY MOVED TO WOODLAND AS A ONE WEEK SO. HAPPY TO BE IN YOUR DISTRICT -- WANTED TO ECHO SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE HEARD HERE TODAY ONE IS THAT THEY'RE ABOUT TO ORDER FIRE SAFE COUNCILS AROUND THE STATE. AND ALMOST ANOTHER TWO UNDER FIRE WAS COMMUNITIES AND THEY REALLY ARE FRONTLINE FOLKS THERE THE FOLKS ON THE GROUND WHO KNOW WHERE THEY LIVE WHO CARE ABOUT WHERE THEY LIVE WHO CARE ABOUT THEIR NEIGHBORS. AND ARE OUT THERE LOOKING AT WHAT THEY CAN DO TO MAKE THEIR COMMUNITIES MORE SAY SO I THINK. IT IT'S A I DON'T WANNA TALK TALK ABOUT FIRST ACCOUNTS IS A RESOURCE BUT REALLY IT IS A RESOURCE THAT WE HAVE STATEWIDE IN TERMS OF A WAY TO GET RESOURCES TO THE GROUND AND TO GET PRAGUE. TO IMPLEMENT PROGRAMS ON THE GROUND SOME SAY IT'S ALREADY IN PLACE WE DON'T HAVE TO REBUILD THAT -- SOME YOU TALKED EARLIER ABOUT DOING HOME ASSESSMENTS ASSISTING WITH ELDERLY LOW INCOME FOLKS. CLOSER THAT'S WHERE THAT HAPPENS A LOT OF FIRES ARE COUNCILS WILL GET FUNDING OFTEN THROUGH OUR GRANT CLEARING HOUSE OR TO CAL FIRE. TO BE CREATING DEFENSIBLE SPACE FOR LOW INCOME ELDERLY DISABLED NEIGHBORS DOING SHIPPING PROGRAMS ON THOSE PROPERTIES SO THOSE ARE CRUCIAL IN TERMS OF TAKING CARE THEIR NEIGHBORS AND KNOWING WHERE THOSE NEIGHBORS ARE WHEN IT COMES TIME FOR EVACUATION -- ALSO LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENTS DO THAT HERE'S THEIR ALSO FRONT LINE OUT THERE ON I JUST MOVED FROM HUMBLE COUNTY OF FORTY TWO DIFFERENT FIRE DEPARTMENTS. OF AGING WORKFORCE IN THE VOLUNTEER FIRE DEPARTMENTS AND THEY'RE ALSO DOING THOSE HOME ASSESSMENTS -- BUT DEFINITELY A RESOURCE IN AN AREA THAT NEEDS SOME ATTENTION -- MMHM. MY SENSE IS THAT IF WE COULD GET SOME FUNDING TO EVERY COUNTY FOR EACH COUNTY FIRE SAY COUNCIL THAT THEN COULD GET DOWN TO THE GROUND TO LOCAL PHARMACY COUNCILS THE MULTIPLIER EFFECT WOULD BE PRETTY PHENOMENAL. AND THAT WHAT YOU HEARD HERE WAS THAT THERE ARE THERE'S FUNDING FOR PROJECTS WERE SPECIALLY FOR FUEL REDUCTION PROJECTS. LOT OF MONEY COMING DOWN TO THE GROUND THERE'S NOT FUNDING TO PAY THAT COORDINATOR. AND SO THERE'S NOT SOMEBODY WHO CAN FACILITATE ALL THAT TO WORK WITH ALL THE VOLUNTEERS TO BE WRITING THE GRANTS TO BE DOING THE PERMITTING ALL THAT KIND OF THING. AND SO I THINK WE NEED BE LOOK AT HOW CAN WE GET APPROXIMATE TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS EVERY COUNTY IN THE STATE AND WE FIGURED IT'S AROUND. TWELVE MILLION KATE I THINK WE FIGURED OR DOING SOME. BACK OF THE ENVELOPE CALCULATIONS -- AND THAT COULD LOOK IT. THAT COULD COME DOWN THROUGH A VARIETY WAYS HUMBOLDT COUNTY ENCOURAGE YOU LOOK AT HUMBOLDT COUNTY BECAUSE THEY'RE COUNTY FIRE SAY COUNSEL WAS STARTED. BY THE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR I BELIEVE THIS PART OF THE GENERAL PAM GENERAL PLAN PROCESS WE JUST UPDATED THE THIRD VERSION OF THE HOME MECHANIC NEED WELFARE PROTECTION PLAN. AND WAS ON THE FRONT PAGE OF THE PAPER THE NOW THROUGH THAT PROCESS THEIR NEW C. W. PPV COMMITTEE WELFARE PROTECTION PLAN. THEY REALIZE IT -- MAYBE WE HAVE A GENERAL PLAN ISSUE IN TERMS OF BUILD OUT IN HIGH RISK AREAS AND NOT HAPPEN BECAUSE INCREDIBLY COLLABORATIVE FIRE SAFE COUNCIL. THAT COUNSEL IS FUNDED AND NOT FUNDED BUT STAFF THROUGH COUNTY OF PUBLIC WORKS PERSON WHO'S BEEN THERE THROUGHOUT AND BECAUSE OF THAT THEY'RE EXTREMELY SUCCESSFUL. OTHER COUNTIES LIKE SAN DIEGO MENACE YOU KNOW NOW SAN MATTEO ARE DOING IT THROUGH THE RESOURCE CONSERVATION DISTRICT. OTHERS ARE PRIVATE ABOUT THESE YEAH OTHERS A PRIVATE NONPROFIT SO WE NEED TO LOOK AT HOW WE'RE GOING TO GET THOSE -- FUNDS DOWN TO THE GROUND AT THE STATE FAIR CITY COUNCIL WERE NOW LOOKING AT HOW TO BUILD A RESOURCE CENTER ENSURE THOSE RESOURCES STATEWIDE. TO CREATE THAT WEBSITE TO CREATE THE EDUCATIONAL RESOURCES BILL THE CAPACITY SO WERE AROUND I'M NOW HERE IN SACRAMENTO WOODLAND SO HAPPY [inaudible] TO CONNECT BANKS. THANK YOU SO MUCH -- DINNER BROUGHT ON BEHALF OF SIERRA CLUB CALIFORNIA I JUST WANTED TO THANK YOU. FOR HOLDING THIS AND VERY IMPORTANT AND VERY PRACTICE HEARING IT'S NICE TO BE PARTICIPATING IN A HEARING -- EARLY ON IN THE SESSION RATHER THAN. IN THE LAST WEEK OR TWO SO AS WE HEARD TODAY THE BEST WAY TO PROTECT -- HOMES AND HUMAN LIVES IS TO WORK FROM THE HOME OUT RATHER THAN THE WILD LANDS AND WILDFIRES INEVITABLE MASSIVE. HUMAN MáS AND PROPERTY LOSS ASSOCIATED WITH IT IS NOT INEVITABLE. SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU AND YOUR STAFF TO SEE HOW WE CONTRACT -- SOME OF THIS FIRE PREVENTION MONEY TO GETTING -- HOMES HARD AND AND DO SOME OF THAT -- DEFENSIBLE SPACE WORK FOR LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS OUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH AGAIN.
