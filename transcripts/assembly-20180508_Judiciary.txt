ASSEMBLY JUDICIARY WE'RE NOT GOING TO START JUST YET I NORMALLY DON'T LIKE TO START WITHOUT THE STATE REPUBLICAN MEMBER HERE. BUT IF WE DON'T GET. ENOUGH FOLKS HERE. WITHIN ANOTHER COUPLE MINUTES WE WILL START ANYWAY AS A SUBCMMITTEE SO I APPRECIATE YOUR PATIENCE I WE HAVE A BUSY AGENDA TODAY SO WE ARE GOING TO START. AS IT SUBCOMMITTEE. THAT COULD GET EVERYONE'S ATTENTION WE WILL START WITH. ITEM NUMBER ONE MR FRAZIER. YOU HAVE TO BILLS WITH US TODAY ITEM NUMBER ONE AB SEVENTEEN SIXTY AND A NUMBER SEVEN AB TWENTY THREE FIFTY THREE. MORNING GOOD MORNING SIR MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS ASSEMBLY BILL SEVENTEEN SIXTY SIMPLY ALLOWS A PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICER. WHO'S REQUIRED TO TAKE HOME A VEHICLE FOR ON CALL EMERGENCY RESPONSE WORK. PART THE VEHICLE IN FRONT OF THEIR HOME. WHEN MERE SECONDS CAN MEAN LIFE OR DEATH IN AN EMERGENCY SITUATION. ADDING EVEN A MINUTE TO GET TO AN EMERGENCY VEHICLE COULD HAVE A PROFOUND IMPACT. THIS BILL ENSURES THE PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICERS HAVE IMMEDIATE ACCESS TO A TAKE HOME EMERGENCY VEHICLE. AND CAN RESPOND EFFECTIVELY TO A CRISIS. OTHER STATES LIKE COLORADO HAVE ALREADY IT OUR ARE ALREADY AHEAD OF THE US ON THIS AND HAVE NOT SEEN ANY CONCERNS. WITH IMPLEMENTATION. CHINA HAS A VETO ONE OF MY OWN CONSTITUENTS WHO IS WITH ME TODAY. BROUGHT THIS ISSUE TO MY ATTENTION AS HIS OWN AGE AWAY THREATENED THREATENED UNREASONABLY DAILY FINES. FOR PARKING HIS EMERGENCY VEHICLE. IN THE ON STREET PARKING AREA OUTSIDE HIS HOME. THIS ISN'T ONE INSTANCE THOUGH IT HAPPENS TO POLICE FIREFIGHTERS AND WAS DRIVERS SHERIFFS AND HIGHWAY PATROL OFFICERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. ULTIMATELY IT'S BAD POLICY TO ALLOW EACH WAYS TO DICTATE PUBLIC SAFETY. FOR OUR COMMUNITIES. WITH ME TODAY'S CHAT AS A VETO A FIRE CAPTAIN WITH THE CITY OF VACAVILLE TO PROVIDE HIM. UP. IMPORTANT INSIGHT. THANK YOU MISTER WRITER AND THERE ARE. AMENDMENTS IN THE ANNOUNCES I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE NOT PREPARED TO TAKE THOSE TODAY YES SIR OF RESPECTFULLY DECLINED THE AMENDMENTS THAT. THANK YOU. FIRST WITNESS PLEASE. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS CHAD AS VETO AND I LIVE IN THE CITY OF THAT BILL. EARLY EARLIER I LAST YEAR IN JANUARY I RECEIVED A LETTER A FORMAL LETTER FROM MY HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION STATING THAT I HAD. VIOLATED RCC AND OURS. THE. LETTER STATED THAT I HAD MULTIPLE VEHICLES TO A MORE VEHICLES PARKED ON. THE STREET WHICH DOES ALLOW PUBLIC PARKING THERE. AND THEY ALSO STATED THAT MY VEHICLE WAS THE COMMERCIAL VEHICLE BECAUSE IT HAD A OF LADDER RACK ON TOP AND AND STICKERS ON THE SIDE DE SIGNIFYING WAS EMERGENCY VEHICLE. SO I CONTACT MY HOMEOWNER ASSOCIATION ASKED THEM IF OTHER WAS A WAY FOR THEM TO GIVE MEAN AND VARIANCE BECAUSE I DO USE THAT VEHICLE TO RESPOND. IN THE EVENINGS WHEN I'M OFF DUTY TO LARGER EVENTS A STRUCTURE FIRES A LARGE VEHICLE ACCIDENTS HAZARDOUS MATERIALS ABOUT CULTS. BECAUSE I'M ARE OUR SAFETY OFFICER FOR THE FOR THE CITY AS WELL. TOM. SKIS ME. THEY BASICALLY STATED THAT THEY WERE SORRY THAT MICHAEL MY VEHICLE WAS A COMMERCIAL VEHICLE AND THERE THEY WERE NOT GOING TO ALLOW ME TO USE AYE TO KEEP THAT VEHICLE THERE. THEY DECIDE TO CHANGE THEIR MIND. THEY. TO GO PLAY ON WORDS THEY SAID THAT THEY WERE NO LONGER GOING TO BE WORRIED ABOUT MY COMMERCIAL VEHICLE THAT I COULD PARK THE COMMERCIAL VEHICLE BUT I WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO PARK MY OWN PERSONAL VEHICLE SO. I WOULD BE ALLOWED ONE VEHICLE ON THE PROPERTY. WHICH. WOULD ELIMINATE ME BONILLA PARK MY OWN PERSONAL VEHICLE THEY'RE THEY'RE AT HOME. SO I DECIDED THAT I WOULD TRY TO LOOK AT THE CASE LAW TO SEE IF THERE'S ANYTHING THAT WOULD SUPPORT. MIKE MY POSITION AND I WAS NOT ABLE TO FIND ANYTHING THAT SUPPORTED ME OF MY POSITION OR. ACTUALLY OPPOSED MY POSITION THERE'S NOTHING OUT THERE THAT WOULD. SIGNIFY EITHER WAY. SO. I WENT BACK TO THEM AND SAID WELL. IS THERE ANY WAY WE CAN ACTUALLY JUST COME TO SOME AGREEMENT AND AND BECAUSE THEY BASICALLY SAID THERE WAS THERE WAS NOTHING WE WERE GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO SO. I STARTED US SPEAKING WITH SOME OTHER. FIRST RESPONDERS IN THE AREA TO SEE IF THERE WAS ANOTHER ANY OTHER ISSUES OR WAS THIS JUST AN ISOLATED THING FOR FOR ME. I DID COME ACROSS ONE OF OUR OFFICERS IN IN BACK OF IL WHO EXPERIENCE THE SAME US SITUATION ANOTHER HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION WITH HER PATROL CAR. SO. BEANS I REALIZE THIS IS A MUCH BIGGER ISSUE THAN JUST MYSELF AND MY HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION I CONTACTED. SO THAT FRAZIER AND ASKED IF HE COULD ASSIST ME IN IN THIS MATTER. AND HE DID. I WANT TO MAKE IT VERY CLEAR THAT THERE'S THERE'S PLENTY OF OPEN SPOTS AND I DON'T WANT TO GET INTO THE DETAILS OF OF MICE SPECIFIC CASE BUT THERE'S PLENTY OF OPEN SPOTS IN MY COMMUNITY I I'M NOT. I'M NOT POSITIONING SOMEBODY ELSE'S CARS OUT OF SIGHT OUT OF. CLICK CLOSE TO THEIR HOME BY ME PARKING THERE WE HAVE. HUNDRED FIFTEEN'S OPEN SPOTS AND THERE'S NO ONLY ABOUT FIFTY SIX VEHICLES PARKED THERE AND THAT'S ACCOUNT THAT I TAKE ABOUT TEN O'CLOCK AT NIGHT SO I COUNTED. AT TEN O'CLOCK AT NIGHT ONE THE AFTERNOON SIX IN THE MORNING JUST TO SEE IF. AND I DON'T I DON'T WANT TO GO TO PUT SIMPLY OUT OF POSITION. I COULD I COULD PARK MY VEHICLE WITHIN ABOUT A FIFTY FEET OF MY HOME AND NOT IMPACT ANYONE ELSE. SO THE POSITION THAT THE SO HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATIONS NOW TAKEN IS THAT MIKE MIKE I SAID MY VEHICLES NOT A COMMERCIAL VEHICLE. BUT I CAN'T PARK MY OWN PERSONAL VEHICLE THERE NOW SO I'M KIND OF IN A SITUATION WHERE EITHER A I. DON'T HAVE OF THE RISK EMERGENCY VEHICLE TO RESPOND TO CALLS FROM MY HOME. OR. I DON'T HAVE A PERSONAL VEHICLE TO GO RUN ERRANDS LIKE GO THE GROCERY STORE OR THOSE TYPE OF THINGS I HAVE TO PARK IT OFF OFF PREMISES. WOULD THAT THE POSITION THAT THEY HAVE SAID THAT IF IF AT THIS POINT TOM I DO DECIDE TO BRING MY MERCY VEHICLE HOME. WHAT THEY'LL DO IS THEY WILL THEY WILL TAKE IT MY PERSONAL VEHICLE WHICH DOES HAVE A REGISTERED STICKER ON IT SEDATING THAT IT CAN BE THERE? BECAUSE THEIR DIFFERING SAYING THAT THE EMERGENCY VEHICLE DOES TAKE PRECEDENCE OVER MY PERSONAL VEHICLES THAT'S THAT'S THE SITUATION I'M IN AND. I WOULD APPRECIATE SOME ASSISTANCE WITH THAT IF. I COULD. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. MISTER CHAIRPERSON I KAYLEE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA AMBULANCE ASSOCIATION WE ALSO SUPPORT THE MEASURE. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS A SHOW MUCH LARA BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION ASSEMBLY. IF YOU KNOW NELSON SUPPORT. ALRIGHT SEE NONE OPPOSITION. THE CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE LOUIS BROWN ON BEHALF OF THE COMMUNITY ASSOCIATIONS INSTITUTE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE ACTION COMMITTEE. WE DO HAVE AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION ON THE BILL. AND APPRECIATE THE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT. MISTER FRASIER'S CONSTITUENT BRINGS TO THE TABLE BUT. AND WE'VE HAD A NUMBER OF CONVERSATIONS WITH YOUR CONSULTANT AS WELL AS. I MISTER FRAZIER STAFF. WE BELIEVE THAT THE PATH FORWARD AS PRESENTED IN THE ANALYSIS IS THE MORE APPROPRIATE PATH FOR THIS. A SIMPLY THE WAY THE BILL AS DRAFTED IS IS MUCH TOO BROAD THEIR FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND ASSOCIATIONS IN CALIFORNIA ALL OF THEM WITH A DIFFERENT SIZE AND DIFFERENT SCOPE. PARKING IS ALWAYS A SERIOUS ISSUE. I FEW HAVE A CONDOMINIUM COMPLEX A WITH UNDERGROUND PARKING THERE'S JUST NOT FLEXIBILITY THERE YOU HAVE OTHER SITUATIONS A SINGLE FAMILY RESIDENCE. QUAD PLEXUS. LEX'S EXCEPT FOR WITH LIMITED STREET PARKING. A COLORADO HAS TAKEN THE LEAD ON THIS AND IN FACT THE AMENDMENTS PROPOSED AMENDMENTS IN THE BILL REALLY FOLLOW THE PATH OF COLORADO. IN ALLOWING FOR. CERTAIN SIZE SPECIFICATIONS ALLOWING FOR CERTAIN REASONABLE ACCOMMODATIONS TO BE MADE UP BY THE ASSOCIATION TO FIT THE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT THEY SEE THEMSELVES AND. AS WRITTEN RIGHT NOW. THE BILL WOULD JUST SIMPLY EXCLUDE ALL RULES. AND ALL RESTRICTIONS ON PARKING. YOU COULD THEN SEE OTHER OWNERS IN THE PARKING LOT IN THAT. ASSOCIATION WHO HAVE A RIGHT TO A PARKING SPOT LOSE THAT PARKING SPOTS SIMPLY BECAUSE OF THE WAY HIS BILL DRAFTED THERE'S NO REQUIREMENT. TO ACTUALLY SHOW THAT THE THE USE OF THE EMERGENCY VEHICLE IS REQUIRED AT THAT ANYTIME I AT THAT TIME AND PLACE SO. UNFORTUNATELY WE DO HAVE TO OPPOSE THE CURRENT VERSION OF THE BILL HOW WE APPRECIATE THE WORK OF THE STAFF AND WOOD. LIKELY TO REMOVE OUR OPPOSITION OUT ONCE WE WERE SEE THESE AMENDMENTS IN PRINT IF THEY WERE TO MAKE IT THAT FAR. THANK YOU THANK YOU. NO ONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE OF BRING IT BACK TO. THE COMMITTEE IN THIS FRAZIER AYE BUT I APPLAUD YOUR CONSTITUENT WORK AND AND STEPPING UP YOUR CONSIDER THINK THAT'S. ABSOLUTE NOBLE. ON THIS ONE THOUGH I HAD NOT AT A POINT TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT IT AND. WERE. WE WENT SORT OF A A A BALANCE THAT WITH THE HOMEOWNER ASSOCIATIONS INDIVIDUALS AND ISSUES ACROSS THE STATE AND. AND I'M SYMPATHETIC TO YOUR PARTICULAR SITUATION BEFORE WHAT WE'VE SEEN. I I DON'T KNOW HOW BROAD THIS IS SO I DON'T KNOW THAT WE'RE REALLY IN A POSITION TO WANT TO DO SOMETHING STATEWIDE. TO TO SOLVE YOUR PARTICULAR PROBLEM AND WE. LOOK THAT. COLORADO WE LOOKED AT OTHER POSSIBILITIES AND AND PROPOSED AMENDMENTS AROUND THAT SO WE WERE GONNA MOVE THIS BILL FORWARD. AMENDMENTS I THINK WOULD BE KEY OTHER THAN THAT IT'S JUST NOT AMERICAN. THEY CAN I DO TO FLETCHER CAN I JUST ASK WHAT. IT DOESN'T WORK IN THE AMENDMENTS BECAUSE I I WANT TO SUPPORT THIS WITH THE AMENDMENTS BUT I CAN'T OBVIOUSLY WITHOUT. SO THE FACILITY WHERE THE H. AWAY SUGGESTING IN PARK IS OVER A QUARTER MILE AWAY BEHIND A LOCKED GATE. AND SO THAT JUST DOESN'T WORK I MIGHT AS WELL BE OUTSIDE THE PREMISES. EN ROUTE ON THE PUBLIC STREET OF BECAUSE THAT'S THE NEXT EXIT. AND SO IT'S JUST IT'S JUST NOT WORKING CAN I LIVE IN AN H. AWAY. ALSO AND I HAVE A MARTINEZ POLICE OFFICER CANINE WHO PARKS IS THE ONLY ONE ALLOWED TO PARK ON THE STREET THEY TAKE IT ALL OF US ALSO IF WE HAPPEN TO DO SO. AND SO I IN THE EVENINGS AND SO YOU KNOW IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS WHERE WE DID TRY TO. CONTACT FIRST THE H. AWAY AND THEY'VE NEVER EVEN GAVE US THE CONSIDERATION OF A RETURN PHONE CALL OR. AT ED OUR LETTER. AND SO WE THOUGHT THIS WAS THE ONLY WAY THAT WE CAN DEMONSTRATE THAT WE WERE. YOU KNOW SUPPORTING NOT ONLY PUBLIC SAFETY BUT OUR CONSTITUENTS CONCERN. MEAN THE SAFETY OFFICER FOR THE CITY OF VACAVILLE AND BEING ABLE TO RESPOND TO ANY KIND OF TRAGEDY. IN A TIMELY MANNER. AND SO THAT THAT WOULD THIS LEFTIST NO KIND OF RECOURSE AND AGAIN THE AMENDMENTS. ARE ARE KIND OF JUST HE MIGHT AS WELL PARK OUT ON THE STREET OUTSIDE OF THE H. AWAY BECAUSE THAT'S I MEAN IT'S VERY CLOSE WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE. COOLER THINGS JUST. KIND OF A. WHY WOULD YOU? OTHER QUESTIONS ADDRESS. I I TOO AM IN THE SAME SITUATION AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER GONZALEZ FLETCHER. THAT. THINK THAT IT IS A PROBLEM THAT NEEDS TO BE RESOLVED I THINK THAT YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO. IT AS A SAFETY OFFICER BE ABLE TO RESPOND. AT ANY MOMENT. BUT I THINK THAT. YOU PROBABLY ARE HAVING A BAD EXPERIENCE WITH THE. YOUR H. AWAY. AND PERHAPS IF IN THE AMENDMENTS. TO HAVE SOMETHING THAT HAS AN APPEALS PROCESS SO THAT IT ISN'T AN ARBITRARY DECISION FROM NH AWAY. BUT TO HEAR ABOUT THAT THE BROAD. HOW BROAD THIS IS DOES CAUSE CONCERN? BUT. I I. I WOULD SINCERELY REQUEST THE DO CONSIDER THE AMENDMENTS TO ALLOW IT TO MOVE FORWARD. AND MS REYES I APPRECIATE THAT NIGHT AND REALLY WANTED TO DO THAT. FOR THIS TO MOVE FORWARD TO HELP. MR AS VETO OF BUT THIS DOESN'T HELP MR AS A VETO IN THIS SITUATION. A IT ACTUALLY IS HE HAS TO RUN FROM HIS HOUSE. GO ACQUIRE A LOCKED GATE UNLOCKED IN. THE THAT THE GATE. OPEN THE GATE GO OUT AND GET IS VEHICLE COME OUT LOCK THE GATE. IT'S JUST IT'S JUST NOT. IT'S NOT. CONDUCIVE TO WHAT THIS IS ALL OF THIS PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICER NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO RESPOND. AND HIS TITLE OF OF PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICER WAS FEEDBACK OF ILL I WOULD LOVE TO BE ABLE TO TO HAVE A WIN ON THIS BUT THIS ISN'T A WIN THIS IS ACTUALLY. PUNITIVE IN AND PUNISHING HIM FOR BEING IN THAT AGE AWAY AND WE AND AGAIN WE DID TRY TO CONTACT THEM SEVERAL WAYS. TO ITS DID SEE HOW WE CAN GET TO YES WE WANTED TO WORK WITH THEM. AND THEY PUT THEY WOULDN'T ACKNOWLEDGE US AND AND THAT'S UNFORTUNATE PENITENT AND WE HAVE HEARD OF MANY MANY INSTANCES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA THROUGH POLL RACK. ENSUED DIFFERENT. ASSOCIATIONS THAT THEY'RE HAVING THE SAME KIND OF. OF A PROBLEMS IN IN THE STATE AND THIS COMMITTEE HAS THE JURISDICTION OVER. ON THIS THIS ABILITY TO HAVE PUBLIC SAFETY. ACKNOWLEDGED IN H. WAYS AN UNFORTUNATE HOPE AND THAT THERE'S NO PUBLIC SAFETY ISSUES COULD EVER HAPPEN IN AN H. AWAY BECAUSE. FOR NOT ALLOWING THEM IN. I MEAN WHAT A TREASURE TO HAVE SOMEBODY IN IT AND PUBLIC SAFETY IN YOUR COMMUNITY. BUT THEN THEY HAVE TO GO OUTSIDE TO GO GET THEIR VEHICLE TO BE ABLE TO RESPOND. EVEN INSIDE. BY YOUR RESPONSE SAYING THAT THE THE AMENDMENTS ARE JUST COMPLETELY OFF THE TABLE ARE YOU WILLING TO LOOK AT THAT LOOK AT THE AMENDMENTS. TOO SICK TO WORK AT THE NEXT LEVEL TO SEE HOW YOU CAN WORD IT IN SUCH A WAY. THAT DOES PROVIDE THE PROTECTION FOR THE REST OF THE HOMEOWNERS BY HAVING SOMEBODY WITH THAT SUCH AS MR SURVEY THOUGH THERE BUT STILL THAT BROUGHT PROVIDES SOME CONTROLLED BY THE H. HIGHWAYS. AS TO HOW MANY OF THESE PERMITS ARE GIVEN. BECAUSE IT IT DOES WITH FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND SO SESSIONS IN CALIFORNIA. AND HAVING ALL OF THEM BUT TOLD EXACTLY WHAT THEY CAN AND CANNOT DO I THINK. APPEARS TO BE OVER REACHING ON OUR PART. AND AGAIN I WOULD HOPE THAT THAT THAT THAT PUBLIC SAFETY WOULD BE EMBRACED INSTEAD OF VILIFIED. NIGHT WHEN I THEY ARE VILIFYING THIS MAN AND NOT RESPECTING HIS POSITION IN THIS COMMUNITY AS AS A LIFESAVER. AND AGAIN IN MY AGE AWAY THERE IS AN EXEMPTION FOR THAT MARTINEZ POLICE OFFICER WHO HAS A CANNON. AND I WOULD HOPE THAT. OF ANY AND WE DID TRY TO WORK WITH THE H. AWAY WE TRIED EVERYTHING THAT WE COULD. AND THEY THEY JUST ABSOLUTELY REFUSE TO TO TO RESPOND TO US. THEY WANT THIRTY DOLLARS A MONTH. AND FOR HIM TO PARK HIS PRIVATE CAR OVER BEHIND A LOCKED GATE IT IN LIEU OF. A IT JUST IS NOT REASONABLE WHEN THERE'S ALL OF THESE EXTRA SPACES THAT HE'S ACKNOWLEDGED. THEY'RE AVAILABLE AND NOT PUTTING ANYBODY ELSE OUT. YOU NO FOR THIS FOR THIS CIRCUMSTANCE IN AGAIN. WE'RE NOT TRYING TO. MAKE IT HARDER MISTER AS VETO. A. BY TAKING THESE EXEMPT THESE AMENDMENTS ARE JUST THEY JUST DON'T WORK IN THIS SITUATION THEY MAN OTHERS BUT THIS SITUATION THEY JUST DON'T WORK. AND AGAIN. UNFORTUNATELY THE H. WAYS ARE ARE ADMINISTERED TO BY. THE LEGISLATURE NOT CITY GOVERNMENTS AND SO THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE AND ARE TRYING TO GO FORWARD. TO WORK AND MAKE SURE THAT MR AS YOU CAN DO HIS JOB IN A TIMELY MANNER. IF YOU OTHER. QUESTIONS COMMENTS. ALRIGHT SING NONE. IT'S FRAZIER MAKE CLOTHES OR RELY STATEMENTS COULD BE YOUR. I JUST WANTED RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE BUT I KNOW IT WON'T HAPPEN TODAY. WITHOUT THE SUPPORT OF THE CHAIR AND I AND APPRECIATE BEING A CHAIR ALSO. BUT WE DO HAVE SUPPORT FROM PORAC CAL FIRE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA SET OF. AMBULANCE ASSOCIATION. I WOULD LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE CHAIR AS THE CHAIRMAN TRANSPORTATION ALSO AND HOW WE CAN FURTHER SUPPORT THIS CAUSE GOING FORWARD. IN ACKNOWLEDGING THAT THERE IS A NEED TO BE ABLE TO. BRIDGE THE SUBJECT WE'RE GOING FORWARD AND. AGAIN. THIS. I APOLOGIZE FOR RESPECTFULLY DECLINING YOUR AMENDMENTS BUT IT IS JUST THIS IS SOMETHING ABOUT IT. ON MY CONSTITUENT I HAVE TO RESPECT. THANK YOU. SO YES LET'S ESTABLISH A QUORUM. STONE HERE CUNNINGHAM CHAO. CHIU GONZALEZ FLETCHER. HOLDEN KALRA KILEY. MAIENSCHEIN. RACE HERE. SO WE DO HAVE A QUORUM. I AM LOOKING FOR A MOTION MOTION WOULD BE TO PASS. THE OF THE MOTION IS THEIR SECOND. SECOND IT THIS OCCURRED SEE. SO WE DO HAVE A MOTION. AND A SECOND MOTION IS IS TO PASS.

SO WE'LL PUT THAT YOUR BILL A CALL FOR OTHER MEMBERS WHEN THEY SHOW UP THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN FIRST THANK YOU. AND THEN YOU ALSO HAVE ITEM NUMBER SEVEN AB TWENTY THREE FIFTY THREE. YES SIR IN PROUD TO. ACCEPT THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS. THANK YOU. PLEASE MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MIGHT SIMPLY BILL TWENTY THREE FIFTY THREE CONCERNS INSPECTIONS INVOLVED CONSTRUCTION. DEFECT LITIGATION REQUIRE INSPECTORS TO BE LICENSED BY THE CONTRACTORS STATE LICENSE BOARD. I HAVE AGREED TO TAKE THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS ARE TODAY OF THE BILL. HOWEVER THERE'S GOING TO. HOWEVER THERE'S ONGOING ABUSE OF THE UNNECESSARILY LONG STATUE OF LIMITATIONS FOR CONSTRUCTION DEFECTS. WHICH LOCKS UP FUNDING THAT COULD BE USED FOR FURTHER DEVELOPMENT AND ULTIMATELY DRIVES UP THE HOUSE OF COSTS A COST OF HOUSING. CALIFORNIA'S CONSTRUCTION DEFECT LAWS WERE HEAVILY NEGOTIATED WELL OVER A DECADE AGO AND WE HAD THE TIME TO SEE AND WE'VE HAD THE TIME. TO SEE THE FLAWS COME TO LIGHT. PROBLEMS STEM FROM THOSE WHO ABUSE THE SYSTEM TO MAKE A QUICK BUCK. CONSTRUCTION DEFECT LAWS AROUND FOR SALE RESIDENTIAL PROJECTS DO NOT REQUIRE CLAIMANTS TO PROVE ANY DAMAGE. AND MANY TIMES A BRING UNLICENSED INSPECTORS TO CONDUCT DESTRUCTIVE TESTING. COSTING BUILDERS COUNTLESS HOURS AND. AND DOLLARS TO CORRECT. OBVIOUSLY THAT'S DESPERATELY NEEDED TIME AND. EXCUSE ME OBVIOUSLY THAT'S DESPERATELY NEEDED TIME AND MONEY THAT COULD GO TOWARD CLOSING CALIFORNIA'S HUGE. HOUSING GAP. MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS ON THE GENERAL CONTRACTOR HAVE BEEN IN THE BUILDING INDUSTRY FOR THIRTY FIVE YEARS AND I'VE SEEN THE CONSTRUCTION DEFECTS BEING USED AND AND A PREDATORY PRACTICES. BEING USED TO. TO A. AGAINST THE DEVELOPERS AND CONTRACTORS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO WORKING IN THE NEXT SIX YEARS IT IF THE. MY CONSTITUENTS CURRENT CONTINUE TO KEEP ME HERE ON WORKING TOWARDS A SOLUTION THAT WORKS ON A CONSUMER PROTECTION. AND ALSO A. BUSINESS PROTECTION OF GOING FORWARD. IT IS JUST. HE'S BEEN MANIPULATED AND THE ONLY PERSON THAT LOSES IN ANY OF THIS IS THE HOMEOWNER OR DID THE A LANDOWNER. WHO'S DONE MULTI FAMILY. TO DATE WITH ME IS ROBERT OF A PODCAST A WITH THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY BUILDERS TO SPEAK ON OF THE HARDSHIPS. THIS LAW CREATES AS THEY TRY TO BUILD HOMES FOR LOWER AND MIDDLE INCOME CALIFORNIANS. A GOOD FIRST WITNESS PLEASE. GOOD MORNING. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS ROBERT BACA I'M A CO FOUNDER AND VICE PRESIDENT OF. CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY BUILDERS. UP UNLIKE WHAT THE THE NAME OF ORGANIZATION IS WE'RE ACTUALLY NOT A EIGHT A BUILDER NOT A DEVELOPER. AND I'LL GET BACK TO THAT. WE ARE ADVOCATES FOR HOMEOWNERSHIP AND CLOSING THE RACIAL AND AND ETHNIC WEALTH GAP. OF THAT WE HAVE HERE IN THIS COUNTRY JUST AS A REMINDER DURING THE GREAT RECESSION. ARE AFRICAN AMERICANS AND LATINOS LOST BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OVERS OVER A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME DURING THE MORTGAGE FORECLOSURE. A CRISIS IT JUST TOOK A COUPLE YEARS FOR THEM TO WIPE OUT SIX YEARS OF ACCUMULATED WEALTH. AND SO OF TODAY WE'RE WE'RE REALLY IT WE'RE HERE TO ASK FOR YOUR APPROVAL FOR. AB TWENTY THREE FIFTY THREE WHICH IF APPROVED WILL REQUIRE A TRAINED AND LICENSE OUR INSPECTORS WHO ARE THEN WILL GO TO INSPECT THE BE. CLAIMS FOR OF CONSTRUCTION DEFECT. AND. WE THINK THAT WOULD BE STRAINED EARNS AND AND. CERTIFIED INSPECTORS THAT WILL RESULT IN LESS CONSTRUCTION LITIGATION A LAST OF LOWER COST OF CONSTRUCTION. BY DEFINITION HOPEFULLY LOWER COST OF INSURANCE. THAT THEREOF. DEVELOPERS WILL WILL WILL BUILD MORE OF AFFORDABLE CONDOMINIUMS AND PEOPLE WILL BE ABLE TO. DRIVE LESS AND LIVE MORE AND AND AND AND DICK AND BE HOMEOWNERS OUT THAT'S THE DESIRED RESULT OF AB TWENTY THREE FIFTY THREE. BUT JUST A MINUTE ABOUT CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY BUILDERS OF OF. ABOUT. TWELVE YEARS AGO WE WANTED TO APPROVE THE FACT THAT THE LOW INCOME FOLKS COULD. BUY A HOME SO WE WE. SAID ABOUT TO BUILD OF HOMES AND FIREBALL CALIFORNIA. UNFORTUNATELY THE GREAT RECESSION STARTED ABOUT THEN BUT MANAGED TO GET A CONSTRUCTION LOAN AND BUILT TEN HOMES AND SOLD THEM AND NOBODY HAS GONE BANKRUPT SINCE THEN. SO WE WE WE PROVED OUR POINT BUT WE ALSO. LEARN THAT THERE'S PREVAILING WAGE AND. CONDO INSURANCE IN A LOT OF OTHER FACTORS THAT GO INTO DEVELOPMENT AND WE QUICKLY CHANGED FROM BEING A DEVELOPER TO BE AN ADVOCATE. AND I THINK IT WAS A GOOD DECISION. OF. WE WE WE BELIEVE THAT. SO WE START FOCUSING ON ON HOMEOWNERSHIP IN CALIFORNIA WHILE EVERYBODY ELSE IS TALKING ABOUT AFFORDABLE HOUSING. NOW IT'S COMPLIMENTARY BUT WE JUST DON'T THINK THAT THERE'S ENOUGH. APPLY BEING BUILT IT IN IN THE STATE. AND. AND SO UNFORTUNATELY THERE ARE A LOT OF HOMES ARE BEING. BUILT THAT ARE LIKE FOUR EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND AND A LOT MORE BUT THERE'S IS MISSING MIDDLE FOR OF WORKFORCE HOUSING AND MILLENNIALS. NO ONE'S PAYING ATTENTION TO THAT PARTICULAR MARKET THERE'S A LOT OF MONEY BEING SPENT. MAYBE NOT ENOUGH ON AFFORDABLE HOUSING BUT THAT THE MISSING MIDDLE DON'T HAVE VERY MANY OPTIONS AND I BELIEVE THAT. KIND OF MILLIONS ARE IT CAN BE A GATEWAY INTO HOMEOWNERSHIP. AND SO OF HARM I'M I'M IN FAVOR OF OF THIS PARTICULAR BILL WHICH WILL ENCOURAGE DEVELOPERS TO BUILD. OF MORE CONDOMINIUMS COULD RIGHT NOW THEIR PRIORITIES TO BUILD APARTMENTS BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE THE OF THE THOSE THAT ARE HAVE THE COMPLICATIONS OF DEALING. WITH ITS INSPECTIONS AND SO PLEASE VOTE YES. THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS RICHARD MARX AND ON BEHALF OF A COALITION OF THOSE SPECIAL TWO GENERAL CONTRACTORS INCLUDING THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA CHAPTERS. ASSOCIATED BUILDERS AND CONTRACTORS THE WESTERN ELECTRICAL CONTRACTORS ASSOCIATION. PLUMBING HEATING COOLING CONTRACTORS OF CALIFORNIA WE LOOK FORWARD TO REVIEWING THE BILL ONCE IMPRINT UP BUT WE CERTAINLY AGREE WITH MISTER FRAZIER. THAT LITIGATION PARTICULARLY FOR LIST LITIGATION A DRIVES UP HOUSING COSTS A REDUCES HOUSING AVAILABILITY A AND WE SUPPORT A INCREMENTAL CHANGE BUT TO IMPROVE THAT THANK YOU.

TREASURY MAY CLOSE THANK YOU OF AS I MENTIONED MISTER CHAIRMAN THERE'S THIRTY FIVE YEARS IN THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY WAS PROUD THAT WE PUT TOGETHER LEGISLATION LAST YEAR TO CREATE A HOUSING BONDS. BUT AS I TOLD MY CAUCUS MEMBERS THAT THERE IS A HESITANCY. OF DEVELOPERS TO BUILD MULTI FAMILY HOMES BECAUSE OF S. B. EIGHT HUNDRED. CONSTRUCTION DEFECT LAW. GENERALLY THESE LARGE SCALE PROJECTS GOING TO LAWSUIT AT NINE NINE YEARS SIX MONTHS BECAUSE THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS IS TEN YEARS FOR LLEYTON PEYTON DEFECTS. BUT PRIMARILY HAVE BEEN FOUND THAT THE ISSUES HAVE BEEN BECAUSE OF LACK OF MAINTENANCE AND IT BECOMES A BUSINESS DECISION. FOR THE LIABILITY COMPANY DE EITHER SETTLE OR FIGHT THE THE CLAIM. OF. KNOWING THAT AS AS AS SOMETHING IS DONE THE SPECIAL SCOPE OF WORK. AS A SUPERINTENDENT FOR DEVELOPERS I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING ON THIS PROCESS BECAUSE RIGHT NOW HOME INSPECTORS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. DO NOT NEED TO BE LICENSED. AND I'LL BE WORKING ON THAT ALSO IN THE UPCOMING LEGISLATURE BUT THE RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE HIM AND THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR ALL THE HARD WORK THAT THEY'VE DONE.

THE CONSENT AGENDA IS ON CALL IT NEEDS ONE MORE VOTE SO WE WILL WAIT. IN ANTICIPATION. THE MEANTIME. TO BLOW YOU HAVE TO BILLS WITH THIS ITEM NUMBER THREE AB TWENTY SIX. SEVENTY ONE. AND ITEM NUMBER EIGHT AB TWENTY THREE SIXTY FOUR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS GOOD MORNING CHO I'LL BEGIN WITH AB TWENTY SEVENTY ONE AND. EXCEPT THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR STAFF'S WORK ON. PROPOSING THOSE AMENDMENTS. I AUTHORED AB TWENTY TWO NINETY NINE A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO WHICH EASTERN STREAMLINED A NUMBER OF REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BUILDING OF FIX A THREE TO ALLEN UNITS AND. I'M GRATIFIED THAT SINCE THE PASSAGE OF THAT BILL WE'VE SEEN IN A. SPLOSION OF PERMITS FOR EIGHTY IS ACROSS THE STATE. SOME CITIES SAW HOWEVER STILL IN THE DARK ON THE NEW RULES AND IT'S TAKEN SOME TIME. ARE BUT WE'RE WORKING ON THAT AND OTHERS CONTINUE TO DRAG THEIR FEET BUT WERE MAKING A DENT IN ARE HOUSING NEEDS WITH THESE RELATIVELY SMALL CHANGES THAT. DIDN'T COST THE STATE ANYTHING AB TWENTY TWO NINETY NINE HAS LED TO THE CONSTRUCTION OF MORE THAN FOUR THOUSAND EIGHTY IS ACROSS THE STATE ALREADY. NEARLY EIGHTEEN HUNDRED OPEN PERMITTED IN THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES ALONE. AND DOES THERE ARE. OVER FOURTEEN HUNDRED UNITS THAT ARE CURRENTLY IN PLANT CHECK IN THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES. CURRENT ELLIE DWP RULES GOVERNING WATER EMPOWER ALLOW FOR BUILDINGS TO BE BUILT IN THE POWER LINE EASEMENT WHICH IS THE DROP LINE UP. OF FOR HIGH VOLTAGE LINES. OF. THE COMMITTEE OUT NEAR THE EDGE OF OUR PROPERTY LINE. I. THIS IS ALLOWED OVER UNINHABITED BUILDINGS AND WHAT THIS IS RESULTED IN. IS A TREND OF GARAGES OR RECREATION ROOMS BEING BUILT IN THESE EASEMENT AREAS. OF THE CITY OF LA HAS FOUND THAT SOME OF THESE BUILDINGS HAVE BEEN CONVERTED TO HABITABLE UNITS. AND THERE'S PEOPLE LIVING IN THEM THAT THE CITY WANTS TO AND. COURAGE THE CONSTRUCTION OF BOTH NEW INSTRUCTION. CONSTRUCTION OF A BUT FOR OWNERS OF NON PERMITTED CONVERSIONS THE CITY WANTS TO. UP PROVIDE FOR BRINGING THESE UNITS TWO OTHER BUILDING CODES TO AID IN THEIR SAFETY. I AB TWENTY TWENTY SEVENTY ONE REMOVES LIABILITY RELATED TO UTILITY SYSTEM FAILURE OR DAMAGE TO STRUCTURES THAT WERE BUILT. FOR JANUARY FIRST TWENTY SEVENTEEN THAT'VE BEEN CONVERTED TO EIGHTY USE AFTER JANUARY TO. FIRST TWENTY SEVENTEEN. THIS SMALL CHANGE COULD FREE UP SOMEWHERE BETWEEN FOUR HUNDRED AND SIX HUNDRED PERMITS THAT ARE CURRENTLY STALLED DUE TO THIS VERY SPECIFIC AND UNIQUE ISSUE. CONCERNING POWER LINE AND GARAGE CONVERSIONS FOR EXISTING HOMES IN THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES. THE LANGUAGE OF THE BELL DOES NOT REMOVE LIABILITY FOR NEW BUILDINGS BUILT IN POWER LINE EASEMENTS AFTER JANUARY TWENTY ONE. SUCH IN JANUARY FIRST OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN. BUT WITHOUT THIS CHANGE DEPARTMENT OF WATER EMPOWER WILL NOT BE ABLE TO ALLOW THESE UNITS TO BE CONVERTED. UNLESS PART OF THE BUILDING IS ACTUALLY REMOVED FROM THAT EASEMENT AND THAT'S VERY IMPRACTICAL. A A SO THIS WOULD DISCOURAGE HOMEOWNERS FROM SEEKING PERMITS AT ALL FOR EXISTING NON PERMITTED CONVERSIONS. AND THAT WOULD RESULT IN THE CONTINUATION OF ILLEGAL STRUCTURES. WITHOUT ASK YOUR AYE VOTE AND INTRODUCE RD MANDELL WHO IS HERE FROM MAYOR ERIC GARCETTI EASE OFF. THANK YOU. FIRST WITNESSED LA THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU FOR CONSIDERING THIS BILL WHICH. ADDRESSES A VERY SPECIFIC ISSUE FACED BY THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES AS WE A TEMPLATE AND ATTEMPT TO IMPLEMENT THAT EIGHTY LEGISLATION UPRIGHT PROVIDING THIS NARROWLY TERROR TAILORED CLARIFICATION OF CURRENT LAW. IN CASES WHERE THE PRESENCE OF THESE LADWP EASEMENTS ARE PREVENTING THAT EIGHTY YOU CONVERSIONS FROM TAKING PLACE. SINCE THE PASSAGE OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER BLOOMS BILL. AS HE MENTIONED WE SEEM EIGHTEEN HUNDRED. NEED TO USE A PERMITTED IN LOS ANGELES AND THIS IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF OUR STRATEGY FOR TACKLING. THE CITY'S AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRISIS. THIS IMPORTANT CLARIFICATION TO THAT CURRENT LAW WILL ALLOW ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED TO SIX HUNDRED ADDITIONAL CONVERSIONS TO TAKE PLACE. AS THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER MENTIONED. THERE ARE LOTS OF STRUCTURES ARE IN THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES OUR REC ROOMS GARAGE IS THAT OUR BELTS CURRENTLY IN THESE EASEMENTS THAT MAY HAVE ALREADY BEEN CONVERTED ILLEGALLY TO THESE. ACCESSORY DWELLING UNITS WERE. AND WE'D LIKE TO HAVE THOSE UNITS PROVIDE OF THE SHADOWS AND BE BROUGHT UP TO CODE. OR THAT WE'D LIKE PAT TO BE CONVERTED. WE WANT TO ENCOURAGE BOTH THIS NEW CONSTRUCTION FOR OWNERS OF NON PERMITTED CONVERSION SUPREMES UNITS UP TO CODE AND ENCOURAGE NEW CONSTRUCTIONS ON AND WITHOUT THIS CLARIFICATION. THAT THE EXISTING COMMUNITIES ALREADY IN LA APPLY. THAT DID THAT LADWP WILL NOT BE ABLE TO LEVEES UNITS TO BE CONVERTED. AND LESS THAT HOMEOWNER TAKES THE. PROHIBITIVE COST OF REMOVING PARTS OF THE BUILDING IN SOME CASES I'M WE'RE NOT EXACTLY SURE HOW MANY PROJECTS. MAY ULTIMATELY GET REJECTED. OR ALTERED TO ME DWP REQUIREMENTS. BUT OF A DO YOU EIGHTY YOU CONVERT FROM PRODUCTS THAT HAVE BEEN ISSUED PERMITS SINCE I JANUARY FIRST TWENTY SEVENTEEN ONLY EIGHT PERCENT HAVE. RECEIVED A CLEARANCE TO PROCEED FROM DWP. AND WE KNOW THAT TWENTY EIGHT PERCENT OF THE UNITS. IN PLANCHETTE MEET BACK CLARENCE SO THERE'S CLEARLY. ADULTERY HERE AND AND. NUMBER PROJECTS THAT CAN ADDRESS OUR. AFFORDABILITY CRISIS THAT ARE GETTING APPROVED. SIR THANK YOU OFFER CONSIDERATION INVESTMENT. PATENT. THANK YOU THANK IF ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. SEEING NONE IS THERE ANY OPPOSITION. CIGNA BRING BACK THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COMMENTS. WE HAVE A MOTION. TO HAVE SECOND. AND A SECOND THINK IT WAS KILEY. I JUST HAVE ONE QUESTION IT LOOKS LIKE THE BILL REGIONALLY PRIDE TO OTHER CITIES AND WAS. AMENDED TO JUSTIFY LA. ANY REASON WHY I YOU KNOW ONE EXTENDED OTHER CITIES AT THIS POINT. BR A PROMISE ONLY BROUGHT BEEN BROUGHT TO OUR ATTENTION VIA THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES AT THIS TIME AND SO. WAS CONSIDERED BEST JUST RESTRICTED TO THAT ONE CITY. SING OTHER QUESTIONS BLOOM YOU MAY CLOSE. MISTER CHAIR THIS IS CERTAINLY AT THE REFORM OF THE EIGHTY YOU LAWS HAS PROVEN TO BE A SUCCESSFUL IN A BIPARTISAN WAY AND I DON'T MEAN REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS I MEAN. NIMBIS IN THE EMBRACE I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. BRIDGING THE DIVIDE MISTER BILL BRIDGING THE DIVIDE. ALL RIGHT WE DO OF THE MOST TO SECOND MOTIONS TO PASS AS AMENDED CALL THE ROLL PLEASE STONE BY STONE AYE CUNNINGHAM CHAO. CHIU. GONZALEZ FLETCHER. GONZALEZ FLETCHER AYE HOLDEN KALRA. KILEY. KILEY AYE MAIENSCHEIN. MAIENSCHEIN AYE REYES. REYES I. THAT BILLS ON CALL. NOT FOR LACK OF POPULARITY BUT LACK OF MEMBERS. SO WITH YOUR TAXATION OKAY. ITEM NUMBER EIGHT AB TWENTY THREE SIXTY FOUR. THANK YOU AGAIN THAT OF MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS SAID AND TO ONCE AGAIN WE WILL BE ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS AND THANKING THE COMMITTEE FOR ITS. ANALYSIS AND WORK ON THIS BILL THIS BILL IS ABOUT ENSURING THAT THE ALICE ACT IS USED FOR ITS INTENDED PURPOSE. WHICH IS SET SIMPLY PUT TO ALLOW LANDLORDS TO EXIT THE RENTAL MARKET. BUT IT IS NOT INTENDED AS A TOOL TO AVOID COMPLIANCE WITH THE LOCAL RENT CONTROL LAW. THE ELLIS ACT. EXPRESSLY PROHIBITS WITHDRAWING LAST ALL OF FOR THE UNITS OF A BUILDING FROM THE RENTAL MARKET. THE LOG INDICATES THAT THERE'S ONLY ONE WITHDRAWAL DATE FOR THE PURPOSE OF CALCULATING RENTAL AMOUNTS WHEN UNITS ARE RE OFFERED FOR RENT. AS CAN BE A AS CAN OCCUR UNDER THE HOUR FACT BUT THERE IS ALSO LANGUAGE GOVERNING THE TENANTS LEASE TERMINATION DATE. THAT SEEMS TO ALLOW MULTIPLE WITHDRAWAL DATES IN ADDITION THERE IS A PROVISION THAT SPECIFIES THAT THERE'S ONLY ONE DAY THAT APPLIES IF THE PROPERTY IS PUT BACK ON THE RENTAL MARKET. AS A CONSEQUENCE SOME LANDLORDS OF TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THIS CONFUSION AND REMOVED UNITS FROM THE RENTAL MARKET. AND RETURN THEM IN A PIECEMEAL FASHION TO AVOID THE ACT'S RESTRICTIONS AND EVADE RENT CONTROL. SOME ARE ALSO APPLYING DIFFERENT WITHDRAWAL DATES TO DIFFERENT UNITS AND CLAIMING THAT RETURNING ONE UNIT TO THE MARKET. DOES NOT OBLIGATE THE LANDLORD TO RE OFFER ANY OTHER UNITS TO FORMER TENANTS. THIS ALLOWS LANDLORDS TO EFFECTIVELY WITHDRAW LASTED ALL OF THE UNITS FROM THE RENTAL MARKET AND IN FACT NEVER. ACTUALLY LEAVE THE RENTAL MARKET. IS THE INTENDED PURPOSE OF ELLIS. OF ALL WHILE STILL HAVING SUCCESSFULLY EVICTED ALL OF THE EXISTING TENANTS AND INCREASING THE RENTS. SO THIS CONFUSION AS LEAD AT LEAST ONE COURT OF APPEAL TO FIND THAT A LANDLORD COULD APPLY DIFFERENT WITHDRAWAL DATES TO DETERMINE THE RENTAL AMOUNT WHEN RE RENTING A UNIT. THIS ALLOWED THE LANDLORD TO CHOOSE A DATE OUTSIDE THE WINDOW OF TIME WHEN THE ACT WOULD REQUIRE THOSE UNITS TO BE OFFERED. PRIOR RENT CONTROLLED RAE DESPITE HAVING RETURNED MULTIPLE OTHER UNITS ON THE PROPERTY THE RENTAL TO THE RENTAL MARKET AT AN EARLIER TIME. THE LANDLORD NEVER ACTUALLY LEFT THE RENTAL MARKET BUT NEVERTHELESS WAS ABLE TO EVICT ALL THE TENETS AND RE RENT ALL OF THE UNITS AT MARKET RATES. THIS I THINK A OF WE SHOULD ALL AGREE IS A GROSS DISTORTION AND SUBVERSION OF THE PURPOSE OF THE ALICE ACT. WHETHER WE AGREE WITH THAT PURPOSE OR NOT. ACCORDING TO THE RENT CONTROL JURISDICTIONS THE COURTS ARE MISINTERPRETING THE LAW AS A RESULT OF THE CREATIVE ACTIONS OF A FEW LANDLORDS. AND IT'S IMPERATIVE TO CLARIFY WHAT THE LAW HAS MEANT ALL ALONG. I. THANK YOU AND ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE IN ONE INTRODUCED ALISON REAGAN WITH THE CITY OF WEST HOLLYWOOD AND BRIAN AUGUSTA. WHO IS REPRESENTING THE SANTA MONICA RENT CONTROL? THANK YOU FIRST WITNESS PLEASE THANK YOU VERY MUCH MY NAME IS ALLISON REGAN I'M A STAFF ATTORNEY FOR THE CITY OF WEST HOLLYWOOD. THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF THE ALICE ACT WAS TO ALLOW LANDLORDS TO EVICT ALL THE TENANTS FROM THE PROPERTY ALL AT ONCE. IN ORDER TO COMPLETELY LEAVE THE RENTAL MARKET AND PUT THAT PROPERTY TO A DIFFERENT YEARS. BUT BECAUSE THERE IS NO REQUIREMENT IN THE ALICE ACT TO ACTUALLY IDENTIFY A VIABLE ALTERNATIVE USE BEFORE SERVING EVICTION NOTICES. AND BECAUSE COSTA HAWKINS ALLOWS LANDLORDS TO SET THE RENTS AT MARKET RATES UPON A VACANCY WE'RE SEEING AN INCREASE IN ABUSE OF THE ELLIS ACT BECAUSE OF THE ENORMOUS PROFITS TO BE MADE. IN GETTING OUT FROM UNDER THE RENT LIMITATIONS IN JURISDICTIONS WITH RENT CONTROL. AND UNFORTUNATELY THE CURRENT ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS ARE JUST TOO WEAK TO PROVIDE A REAL DETERRENT. IN THE FACE OF SKYROCKETING MARKET RENTS. SO THAT AND WE AGREE THAT MOST LANDLORDS YOU SALAS APPROPRIATELY WHICH IS ALL THE MORE REASON TO CRACKDOWN ON THOSE UNSCRUPULOUS LANDLORDS WHO ARE CREATING HOUSING INSTABILITY. AND PUTTING THOSE LAW ABIDING LANDLORDS AT A DISTINCT DISADVANTAGE SO THESE AMENDMENTS ARE DESIGNED TO REDUCE THE INCENTIVE TO GAME THE SYSTEM. PRESERVE AFFORDABLE HAVE PRESERVE EXISTING AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE IS PLAYING BY THE SAME RULES AND THAT WILL ENSURE THAT ELLIS IS USED ONLY AS IT WAS INTENDED. THANK YOU. THANK YOU THAT'S BURKE THANK YOU CHAIR MEMBERS TRYING TO CAST ON BEHALF OF THE SANTA MONICA RECTAL BOARD AND ALSO THE CALIFORNIA RURAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE FOUNDATION IN SUPPORT OF THE MEASURE.

COLLEAGUES AS YOU WERE FAMILIAR FROM YOUR SERVICE ON THIS COMMITTEE ONE COURTS LACK OF RESOURCES CIVIL LITIGATION IS AMONG THE FIRST TO FEEL IT. AS A RESULT THE PLAINTIFF AND DEFENSE BAR TWO GROUPS THAT ARE NOT ALWAYS ON THE SAME PAGE HAVE BEEN WORKING TOGETHER IN RECENT YEARS TRIED THEN A FIVE FISH AND SEES THAT CAN BENEFIT ALL PARTICIPANTS. FOR THOSE WHO DID WHO. FOR THOSE WHO DO NOT PRACTICE CIVIL LITIGATION SEPARATE STATEMENTS ARE RECITATIONS OF THE LAW AND FACTUAL EVIDENCE AT THE CORE OF A MOTION. WELL THE GOAL OF ATTACHING SEPARATE STATEMENTS IS TO HAVE A SINGLE DOCUMENT THAT ENCAPSULATES ALL ISSUES IT CAN EASILY BECOME UNWIELDY. ACCORDINGLY THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW CORDON DISCOVERY TO HAVE A PARTY SUBMIT A CONCISE OUTLINED IN LIEU OF OF A WOMAN IS FILING. IN ADDITION FOR SUMMER JUDGMENT MOTIONS THE BILL WOULD ALLOW A PARTY TO LIST STATEMENTS IN A MORE LOGICAL ORDER BY CAUSE OF ACTION OR COUNT. THESE CHANGES ARE NEITHER RADICAL NOR CONTROVERSIAL BUT THEY WILL PROVIDE HELPFUL STREAMLINING.

GONZALEZ FLETCHER. GONZALEZ FLETCHER AYE HOLDEN. KILEY. KILEY AYE KALRA. KALRA IKE MAIENSCHEIN MAIENSCHEIN AYE REYES. REYES I. THAT ELIZABETH'S SO MISTER BERMAN ITEM NUMBER FOURTEEN AB THIRTY TWO SEVENTY. GREAT. MISTER CHAIRMAN COLLEAGUES I COME BEFORE YOU TODAY TO PRESENT AB THIRTY TWO SEVENTEEN A BILL TO ADDRESS MISLEADING ADVERTISING IN THE LEGAL SECTOR. FIRST I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE CONSULTANT FOR HER WORK. ON THIS BILL IN THE CHAIR FOR YOUR EARLY ENGAGEMENT I'LL BE PLEASED TO ACCEPT THE AMENDMENT SPECIFIED ON PAGE TEN OF THE ANALYSIS. I SUSPECT THAT EVERYONE IN THE ROOM HAS WATCHING ADVERTISEMENT ASKING IF YOU'VE TAKEN A PARTICULAR PRESCRIPTION DRUG OR HAD AN IMPLANTABLE MEDICAL DEVICE SUCH AS A HERNIA MASS. THE MESSAGES CAN EASILY LEAD A PERSON TO WONDER IF THE MEDICATION PRESCRIBED OR DEVICE IMPLANTED BY THEIR DOCTOR IS DOING MORE HARM THAN GOOD. AS PROPOSED TO BE AMENDED THE EXISTING CONTEXT OF THE BILL WOULD BE STRUCK AND REPLACED BY A NARROW TO SENTENCE ADDITION TO THE CONSUMER LEGAL REMEDIES ACT. THIS BILL LIKE THE CONSUMER LEGAL REMEDIES ACT IS INTENDED TO PROTECT CONSUMERS FROM DECEPTIVE BUSINESS PRACTICES. SPECIFICALLY THE BILL WOULD EXTEND THE CONSUMER LEGAL REMEDIES ACT TO MATERIAL MEANT TO MATERIALLY MISLEADING ADVERTISING OF LEGAL SERVICES TO PERSONS WHO MAY ALLEGE INJURY FROM PRESCRIPTION DRUG OR IMPLANTABLE MEDICAL DEVICE. IMPORTANTLY THE BILL PROVIDES THAT AN ADVERTISEMENT MAYBE CONSIDER MATERIALLY MISLEADING IF IT EITHER MATERIALLY UNDERSTATES THE BENEFITS OF A DRUG OR DEVICE OR MATERIALLY OVERSTATES THE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THE DRUG OR DEVICE. PRESCRIPTION DRUGS CAN SAVE LIVES AND MEDICAL DEVICES CAN MAKE QUALITY OF LIFE BETTER BUT I WILL ACKNOWLEDGE THAT NEITHER IS PERFECT. MY HOPE IS THAT THE BILL WILL LEAD TO DO WHAT LEAD THOSE PUTTING FORTH THESE ADVERTISEMENTS TO MORE CAREFULLY CONSIDER HOW THE CHARACTERIZED BOTH THE UPSIDE AND DOWNSIDE OF DRUGS AND MEDICAL DEVICES. I ASK YOUR AYE VOTE AND I HAVE WITH ME. TODAY MIGHT BELOW. ON BEHALF OF THE SOUL JUST ASSOCIATION. ORGY. JOHN DOUGHERTY. OR WHOEVER WANTS TO DIRECT APPRECIATED. ARE JOHN DORY AND HAVE THE CIVIL JUSTICE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF AB THIRTY TWO ONE SEVEN. I DO WANNA ECHO BOTH THANKS TO THE AUTHORS OFFICE AND HIS STAFF AS WELL AS THE CHAIR AND AND HIS STAFF TO. TRY AND REACH AN AGREEMENT ABOUT HOW TO ADDRESS THIS. ISSUE AS PROPOSED TO BE AMENDED WE THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT STEP IN HELPING TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC HEALTH WITH OUT LIMITING THE ABILITY FOR CONSUMERS TO LEARN. ABOUT DANGEROUS ARE DEFECTIVE PROP UP PRODUCTS FOR ADVERTISING. SO THE BILL FOCUSES ON. LEGAL ADVERTISING FOR LEGAL SERVICES BECAUSE OF THE CONTINUING EXPLOSION AND. IN EXPENDITURES AND NUMBERS OF COMMERCIALS THAT THE PUBLIC IS BEING HIT WITH. IT'S TRIPLED OVER THE LAST DECADE ON AND THE LATEST FIGURES. INDICATE THAT. ALMOST A BILLION DOLLARS WERE SPENT ON ON ADVERTISING AND. TWENTY SEVENTEEN ON AND THERE IS NOW CONSIDERABLE EVIDENCE THAT THE SHEER VOLUME THE NATURE OF THE ADVERTISING WHICH IS OFTEN DESIGNED. TO SHOCK AND SCARE COMPETE. CONSUMERS AND ACTION IS HAVING AN IMPACT THAT GOES BEYOND. JUST SIGNING UP THEM PEOPLE FOR LAWSUITS. WORK CONCERN BECAUSE THE ADS INFLUENCE CONSUMERS BY. UTILIZING SOME TACTICS THAT ARE CONCERNING. THEY. FREQUENTLY ARE LABELED AS MEDICAL OR HEALTH ALERTS THEY INCORPORATE MEDICAL SYMBOLS THEY USED THE TERM FTA. AND IN MOST SIGNIFICANTLY THE ADS OFTEN WARNED THAT USE OF THE DRUG OR DEVICE CAN RESULT IN DIRE CONSEQUENCES. HEART ATTACK STROKE BIRTH DEFECTS WITHOUT ACTUALLY TALKING ABOUT WHAT LEVEL OF RISK THAT IS. AND SO IN ADDITION TO THE. NUMEROUS POLLS SURVEYS THAT HAVE BEEN OUT THERE SHOWING THAT THIS THAT THESE DO HAVE IMPACTS ON THE FTA ITSELF. TRACKS THESE CLAIMS. AND IN ONE INSTANCE. JUST LOOKING AT THE ONE DRUGS ALTER THEIR ELDER IDENTIFY THIRTY ONE CLAIMS WITH DOCTORS AND PATIENTS WERE THEY THOUGHT THAT THE. ON PERSON STOP TAKING THEIR MEDICATION AFTER. AFTER WATCHING ONE OF THESE ADVERTISEMENTS AND HAD A SEVERE INJURY OR DEATH AS A AS A PROXIMATE CAUSE THEY'RE. ON IN A SEPARATE. INQUIRY LAUNCHED BY CONGRESS. LOOKING AT A BROADER PERIOD TIME THEY FOUND SIXTY ONE DIFFERENT COMPLAINTS OF THE SAME STE. CIRCUMSTANCES WITH SIX RESULTING DOUBTS SO WHAT ON I JUST WANT TO BRIEFLY TALK ABOUT WHY EXISTING LAW ON ISN'T ENOUGH TO HANDLE THIS AND ONE OF THAT IS THE NATURE OF PHARMACEUTICALS AND MEDICAL DEVICES. ON MANY OF THEM ALTHOUGH THE ANALYSIS POINTS OUT THAT IN A PERFECT WORLD WOULD NEVER DO ANY HARM. ON A LOT OF TIMES FOR DOCTORS AND PHYSICIANS IT'S COMPETING BENEFITS VERSES POTENTIAL HARMS. ON AND SO IT IS TRUE THAT SOME OF THESE MEDICAL DEVICES AND PHARMACEUTICALS FAR SUIT PHARMACEUTICAL DRUGS. ACTUALLY SHOW THAT THERE IS POTENTIAL HARM THAT COULD RESULT IN A SMALL NUMBER OF CASES AND SO THE ADS CAN BE FACTUALLY ACCURATE ABOUT THOSE DANGERS BUT IF THEY DON'T HAVE THE CONTEXT IN THE BALANCE. THAT'S A PROBLEM WE ALSO A APPRECIATE THAT WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THE RULES OF PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT. WE THINK THAT ANY EFFORTS TO SORT OF EXPAND ON THE ETHICAL A REGIME FOR ATTORNEYS IS GOOD ON HOWEVER WE THE LIMITS ON THOSE ARE ONE WHO THEY CAN APPLY TO. ON THAT NEEDS TO BE. ATTORNEYS FOR THOSE ASSOCIATED WITH ATTORNEYS WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT MOST OF THE. MOST OF THE INDEPENDENT AT FIRMS WOULD QUALIFY UNDER THAT AND ALSO THOSE ARE ALL FOCUSED ON ON THE NATURE OF THE LEGAL SERVICES SO. I'M FOR THOSE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU THAT'S WITH US WE. MISTER CHAIRMAN WURSTER THOMPSON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION A WE ARE SUPPORT THIS BILL PRIOR TO THE AMENDMENT TO REMOVE THE OPPOSITION CONSULTATION PIECE WE DO BELIEVE. THAT THAT CONSUMERS WHO DO STOP TAKING THEIR MEDICATION OR MEDICAL DEVICE AS A RESULT OF THESE ADVERTISEMENT SHOULD CONSULT A PHYSICIAN BEFORE DOING SO. THAT'S THAT STILL AMENDED WE BELIEVE THIS BILL IS SENSIBLE POLICY TO OF MAKE THESE ADS MORE A FAIRLY BALANCED ENSURE A PATIENT SAFETY SO WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU EX WITNESS PLEASE. THAT OUR ANNUAL. GIVING A TALK A CONSUMER TWENTY THE CALIFORNIA WE WERE OPPOSE THE BILL AND PRINTS WE DO NOT HAVE A POSITION ON THE BALLOT BUT THE AMENDED WE APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S WORK IN THE COMMITTEE THE COMMITTEE STAFF. AND THERE REALLY IS NO INCENTIVE FOR ATTORNEYS TO DO FALSE ADVERTISEMENT THERE'S A LOT OF RULES THAT WE ARE DISCUSSED TODAY AT THE GOAL RULE STATUTES THAT ARE IN PLACE TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC. SO WE WILL REVIEW THESE AMENDMENTS THAT THERE'S ANY CONCERNS WE HOPE TO WORK THEM OUT IN THE SENATE THANK YOU. ACCUSE ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. SEEING NONE IS THERE ANY OPPOSITION. ALRIGHT SAY NONE OF BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE AND THANK YOU MISTER BERMAN FOR TAKING THE AMENDMENTS. I UNDERSTAND WHERE YOU'RE GOING BEFORE WE AMENDED IT I DON'T COMPLETELY DISAGREE WITH THAT. BUT IT'S UP TO IT'S A BIGGER ISSUE ULTIMATELY AND SORT OF FOCUSING ON THE ATTORNEYS WHO ARE SUBJECT TO RULES DOCTORS WHO ARE SUBJECT TO RULES THERE ARE OTHER PLAYERS MAYBE WE NEED TO GET THAT. I GUESS I'M A LITTLE OLD CHOOL WHEN IT COMES TO ATTORNEY ADVERTISING AND. DON'T LIKE THE PROLIFERATION WITH THE WAY SOME OF IT GOES NOR DO I LIKE WE HAVE A BIT OF A. SOCIETY SUBJECT TO SOME HYPOCHONDRIA AND SINGLE THE DRUG ADS AND THAT MEDICAL DEVICE IT'S DISPENSED THROUGH. ADVERTISING MECHANISMS LEADS OFTEN TO. WRONG CONCLUSIONS BY CONSUMERS WHO MAY STOP IN THIS CASE STOP TAKING A MEDICATION THAT THEY SHOULDN'T WITHOUT CONSULTING THEIR DOCTOR OR WHO MAY DECIDE THAT THEY NEED SOMETHING THAT THEY REALLY DON'T. THEY NEED TO CONSULT THEIR DOCTOR SO IT'S. WITH WE'RE JUST BOMBARDED WITH ALL OF THIS ON KIND OF ALL SIDES AND. GETTING OUR HANDS AROUND IT IN THEIR PRODUCTIVE WAY. WE GIVE SOMETHING THAT THAT WE DEFINITION BE LOOKING AT AND AND AND THIS IS A STEP AND ALSO GIVES US THE OPPORTUNITY TO THINK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT WHAT NEXT STEPS MIGHT BE AND AND WHAT WE CAN INFER. SO I APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING IT FORWARD. TAKE ME AMENDMENTS AND LOOK FORWARD TO THE CONTINUED CONVERSATION. OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS. FOR MEMBERS. SEEING NONE. BUT WAS CUT OFF LETTER. THE CHAIR VOICE MY CONCERNS I AM IT WAS AMAZING TO ME TO HEAR. THE OPPOSITION BECAUSE OUR THAT SUPPORT I GUESS OF OF WHY WE NEED THIS BILL BECAUSE. I'M YOU COULD LISTEN TO THAT ENTIRE. TESTIMONY AND IT COULD HAVE APPLIED TO THE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES THAT ARE ADVERTISING THESE DRUGS. AND SO I I FEEL CONFLICTED A LITTLE IN THE FACT THAT YOU KNOW WHERE WE'RE GOING AFTER ONE AND WHICH MAY NEED SOME. CHANGES. BUT WE HAVE ACCEPTED AND STILL ALLOW MASSIVE ADVERTISING BY PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES. ON ON TELEVISION WHICH HAS LED TO A LOT OF THESE ISSUES SO I JUST WANTED TO KNOW I AM GOING TO SUPPORT IT TODAY I'M UNCOMFORTABLE. TAKING ON ONE AND. PORTION OF IT WITHOUT BEING ABLE TAKE ON THE OTHER I WOULD PREFER PROBABLY THAT NONE OF THESE ADVERTISEMENTS ARE HUNT TELEVISION. NOW I CAN'T THAT FAR BUT I'M. THE REBUILT MY BARCHART. I'M JOKING I'VE BAD AYE I DO IT I THOUGHT IT WAS VERY TELLING AND SOMETHING WE SHOULD BE AWARE OF THAT AT AS YOU TESTIFIED. THE VERY SAME THINGS COULD BE SAID OF ABOUT THE WHAT I FIND. THE TRIGGERING OF PHARMACEUTICAL COMMERCIALS THEY GET PEOPLE. ONTO THESE DRUGS IN THE FIRST PLACE. SO I YOU KNOW HOW MANY WE DON'T HAVE THE STUDIES OF HOW MANY PEOPLE STOP TAKING MEDICATION THAT MAYBE THEY NEVER NEEDED TO TAKE IN THE FIRST PLACE. AND THAT WOULD BE A POSITIVE THING SETTLED. THAT PROBABLY WOULD BE A GOOD STUDY AS WELL THANK YOU I'M GONNA MOVE THE BILL THANK YOU THANK YOU THERE'S A MOTION IS OUR SECOND. CUBA SCHOLAR. YEAH I KNOW I SHARE SOME OF THE HESITANCY AS WELL HOWEVER I APPRECIATE THE CHAIR'S COMMENTS THAT I DO THINK THERE'S ABOUT A CONVERSATION. THAT IS NECESSARY ONE QUESTION I HAD. I'M REGARDING. WHO THE BILL IS REALLY TARGETING BECAUSE AS AS WE KNOW? IS. THE WITNESS TESTIFIED IN AN OPPOSITION ARE CONCERNED POSITION IS THAT I'M THERE ARE SO MANY WARS HAS I KNOW THAT THE AUTHOR KNOWS. BOB BEING ATTORNEY AS WELL THAT THAT ALREADY GUIDE TO ETHICS IN THE RULES AS TO WHAT ATTORNEYS CAN DO INCLUDING REGARDING ADVERTISING AND SO. I IF YOU ARE A WITNESS CAN ELABORATE LIES TO THE THE TARGET. OF THIS OF OTHER LEGISLATION. VERIFY THAT BECAUSE I THINK THAT. REQUIRES LITTLE CLUE LITTLE CLARITY CHIRP ABSOLUTELY. SO IN TAKING A LOOK AT RULED SEVEN POINT ONE WHICH ACTUALLY GUIDES THIS. ON THE OVER RIDING PRINCIPLE ABOUT THEM LEGAL SERVICES ADVERTISING'S IS ABOUT HOW YOU ARE MATERIALLY REPRESENTING. THE LEGAL SERVICES. AND SO. THE VERY FIRST LINE OF THAT IS A LAWYER SHALL MAKE SHALL NOT MAKE A FALSE OR MISLEADING COMMUNICATION ABOUT THE LAWYER OR THE LAWYER SERVICES. AND SO. THAT LEAVES OUT. CLAIMS ABOUT DEVICES OR PRODUCTS THAT MAY OR MAY NOT BE DEFECTIVE. AND SO THE CONCERN IS ON YOU KNOW WHEN YOU WHEN YOU RUN THROUGH ALL OF THOSE RULES THERE ABOUT DON'T PROMISE A PARTICULAR RESULTS FROM THE LAWSUIT. DON'T PROMISE YOU CAN NEW YOU KNOW YOU CAN SPEAK SPANISH WHEN YOU DON'T SPEAK SPANISH DON'T YOU AND SO THERE ARE A LOT. BUT YOU KNOW THEY DON'T APPLY. TO THE CLAIMS ABOUT PRODUCTS AND THEY ALSO HAVE A LIMIT ON IN TERMS OF HOW FAR THEY CAN REACH. INTO. PEOPLE THAT ARE LAWYERS I'M AND SO THAT THETHE WAY THE BILL AS DRAFTED IS ANYBODY WHO'S DOING ADVERTISING FOR LEGAL SERVICES REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE A LAWYER. AND AND THAT'S PART OF THE REASON WHY IT'S BEING PLACED. BUTTON OR UNDER THE CONSUMER. LEGAL REMEDIES ACT AND NOT AND NOT SPECIFIC IN. BUT I'M TO BE JUST CONDUCT OF LAWYERS RIGHT. AND I'M. YEAH AND I THINK THAT. I. AGREE THAT THERE'S YOUR IN TERMS OF FALSE OR MISLEADING ADVERTISING I THINK WE HAVE TO BE CAUTIOUS AS WELL. IN TERMS OF. THE. IN OF THE OFTENTIMES WHEN THERE'S. ABOUT LITIGATION AFTER ISSUES THAT OCCUR THAT HAVE BEEN FOUND. TO HAVE BEEN SUBSTANTIATED AND LAWYERS ARE REACHING OUT TO FIND OUT IF PEOPLE ARE VICTIM OF THAT. THAT. THERE'S OTHERS ALSO UP ON. A PUBLIC GOOD IN AND THE ABILITY BILL TO DO THAT AS WELL AND SO I A. UNDERSTAND THE CONCERN FROM THE CONSUMER ATTORNEYS AGO THAT THIS REALLY DOES COME DOWN TO THE DETAILS. OF EXACTLY HOW IT'S AMENDED AND HOW. YOU KNOW THAT MUCH ABOUT THE FINAL TEXT IS IN SO. I'M I WILL CERTAINLY BE INTERESTED IN IN SEEING THAT WERE CONTINUE I KNOW THAT THERE'S BEEN CONVERSATIONS FROM. THE SPONSORS AS WELL I'M. AS THE AUTHOR AND I KNOW THAT THE CHAIR HAS BEEN HELPFUL IN THOSE CONVERSATIONS BUT. I THINK THAT THIS IS DEATHLY ONE OF THOSE PILLSBURY REALLY IS IN THE FINE PRINT. IT AS TO BUT THE FINAL PRODUCT WILL LOOK LIKE BECAUSE I I JUST I STILL HAVE THAT WORRY THAT WE DON'T WANT TO GO TOO FAR. I THINK THERE'S IS A VALUE TO BE ABLE TO GO TO MARKET OPTICALLY. SUBSEQUENT TWO A A PRODUCT WOULD HAVE YOU BEING FOUND HAVE SOME ISSUES. ABOUT BEING ABLE TO. LET THE WORLD KNOW AND AND TELEVISION OR OTHER ADVERTISING. WHETHER WE LIKE IT OR NOT IS HOW WE GET THAT WORD OUT THERE AND SO. THAT AS WE PUT PARAMETERS ARE JUST TO BE CAUTIOUS AS TO NOT OVERREACH. AND I KNOW THAT THAT'S BEEN ABOVE MUCH OF THE CONVERSATION THAT'S BEEN OCCURRING. NIBBLED THE. AS THIS BILL HAS MOVED FORMER SOME OF THE AMENDMENT SO THAT. DOES MY COMMENTS ON IT I THINK IT PROJECT THANK YOU GIVE THIS RACE IN THE MIST MAIENSCHEIN. I DO WANT TO ECHO THE COMMENTS OF MY. COLLEAGUES COULD DO HAVE STATE PARK CARDS. THE CONVERSATION THOUGH WITH CONSUMER ATTORNEYS IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEY ARE THE ORGANIZATION THAT BEST REPRESENTS. THE PROTECTIONS OF THE CONSUMERS AND THE ATTORNEYS WHO REPRESENT THEM SO I DON'T CORD YOU TO CONTINUE THAT CONVERSATION. AND LOOK FORWARD TO THEIR RESPONSE WANT ONCE THEY HAVE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW THE. THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE PROPOSED. THANK YOU. SO I TRIED. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AT JUST A COUPLE OF REALLY BRIEF POINTS. I THINK THIS THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT'S GETTING OUT WHETHER WHERE WE KNOW. THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF ABUSES. SORT OF IT ANECDOTALLY AND OTHERWISE. AND AND BUT MOST MORE THAN WHAT I WANNA SAM LIKE TO CREDIT THE AUTHOR AND PEOPLE SEE AROUND THE TABLE IT'S GREAT TO SEE THIS COALITION WORKING TOGETHER. AND SO I THINK GOING FORWARD HOPEFULLY. THAT WILL LEAD TO TO MORE. YOU KNOW PRODUCTIVE LEGISLATION IN GETTING OUT AND SOLVING A LOT OF THESE PROBLEMS SO KUDOS TO ALL OF YOU GUYS FOR WORKING TOGETHER ON THIS. THANK YOU. AND IN FOR MEMBERS TO RAISE CONCERNS IT'S ONE OF THE REASONS THAT THIS IS NARROWLY TAILORED SO WE HAVE A CHANCE TO KIND OF THINK IT THROUGH. UNDERSTAND IMPLICATIONS IS ADVERTISING LEGAL ADVERTISING AT ITS BEST IS GETTING INFORMATION LEGITIMATE INFORMATION OUT TO CONCERNED CONSUMERS. IN WAYS THAT THEY NEEDED AND THEY CAN BENEFIT FROM IT AND BUT THERE DOES SEEM TO BE POOR PROLIFERATION OF POTENTIALLY OR SOMETHING IS NOT NECESSARILY THE LEGAL ADVERTISING BUT KEPT AS LEGAL ADVERTISING. AND THAT'S MISLEADING WITH AND I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH THE COMMENTS ABOUT SORT OF THE THE FLIP SIDE WERE FLOODING THE AIRWAVES. AND IN CREATING PERCEPTIONS OF NEED THAT MAY OR MAY NOT BE THERE SO IT IT'S. IT'S A COMPLEX VERY MODERN. ISSUE FOR US. RIGHT OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS CENA MISTER BERMAN YOU MAKEUP JUST I REALLY WANT THINK THE CHAIR AND YOUR COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THE CONVERSATIONS THAT WE'VE HAD. AND YOU KNOW WORKING WITH FOLKS FROM ALL SIDES OF THIS ISSUE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE NARROWLY TAILOR SOMETHING. THAT PROVIDES ADDITIONAL CONSUMER PROTECTIONS BUT THAT ISN'T OVERLY ONEROUS. ON THE LEGAL SECTOR IN THEIR ABILITY TO IT TO YOU TO REACH OUT TO FOLKS WHO MIGHT HAVE BEEN HARMED. A WHICH IS THE BALANCE THAT WE'RE STRIVING FOR SO. WOULD RESPECT ASK FOR A VOTE. THANK YOU THANK YOU WE DO HAVE A MOTION A SECOND MOTIONS TO PASS AS AMENDED KALRA PLEASE STONE BY STONE AYE CUNNINGHAM CHAU. JOE I CHIU. GONZALEZ FLETCHER GONZALEZ FLETCHER AYE HOLDEN. KALRA.

SOMALIA MISTER KILEY ON NIGHT OF FOURTEEN A. B.. THIRTY TWO SEVENTEENTH OUTSIDE. WAS FUND IS WELCOME THAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS DIED TODAY I'M HERE TO PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY ONE TWENTY THREE. AB TWENTY ONE TWENTY THREE WILL PROVIDE BOTH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND CIVIL RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS WITH MORE TIME TO IMPLEMENT THE TRANSITION TO DISTRICT BASED ELECTIONS. THE ENACTMENT OF ASSEMBLY BILL THREE FIFTY IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN SET UP THE CURRENT SYSTEM WHICH GOVERNS THESE TRANSITIONS. HOWEVER SINCE AB THREE FIFTY BOTH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND CIVIL RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS HELP THEM FOUND THAT MORE TIME IS OFTEN NEEDED TO IMPLEMENT THESE TRANSITIONS. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS NEED MORE TIME TO DO PUBLIC OUTREACH AND CIVIL RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS OFTEN NEED MORE TIME TO HELP UNDER REPRESENTED COMMUNITIES ORGANIZE IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO ADVOCATE FOR THEIR INTEREST. ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY ONE TWENTY THREE WOULD HELP ADDRESS THIS ISSUE BY PROVIDING FOR A MUTUALLY AGREED UPON EXTENSION OF NINETY DAYS TO IMPLEMENT THE TRANSITION TO DISTRICT BASED ELECTIONS. DURING THIS TIME PERIOD POTENTIAL PLAINTIFFS WOULD BE. REMAINED BARRED FROM COMMENCING LITIGATION AGAINST A LOCAL GOVERNMENTS UNDER THE CBR A.

THE TRANSITION. FROM AN AT LARGE ELECTION SYSTEM TO BUY DISTRICT ELECTION SYSTEM SORT OF THE MOST IMPORTANT AND FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES IN LOCAL CHURCH. LOCAL DEMOCRACY THE JURISDICTION OF WILL EXPERIENCE IT'S IMPORTANT REMEMBER THAT THE REASON FOR THAT TRANSITION UNDER THE CVR ES STRENG PROVIDE MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR UNDERREPRESENTED COMMUNITIES TO ELECT CANDIDATES THAT REPRESENT THAT COMMUNITY. THAT'S WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT THAT THOSE UNDER REPRESENT COMMUNITIES HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE A VOICE IN THE PROCESS OF CREATING THOSE INAUGURAL DISTRICTS. AS THE MEMBERS MENTION WHAT WE FOUND THOSE IN MANY CASES IT CAN BE DIFFICULT TO WITHIN ONLY NINETY DAYS TO BE ABLE TO MOBILIZE AYE COMMUNITIES EDUCATE THEM ABOUT WHAT DISTRICTING DOES. IMPORTANCE AND TO GET THEM INVOLVED IN THOSE HEARINGS SO WE THINK THIS ADDITIONAL TIME EXTENSION OR PROP SEEMING TO BE A A SIMPLE CHANGES ACTUALLY ONE OF PROFOUND IMPORTANCE THAT WILL REALLY IMPROVE THAT PROCESS. BY ALLOWING MORE PEOPLE TO BE PART OF THIS. INITIAL DISTRICTING AND TO FURTHER IMPROVE REPRESENTATION HAS THAT TRANSITION BECAUSE FOR SO THAT REASON WERE STRONGLY IN SUPPORT ONE THINK THE OFF FOR BRING IT.

MISTER CHAIR NUMBERS CAITLYN BAKER FOR THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION WE ARE HERE IN STRONG SUPPORT. AND LISTENING TO FIVE LS SPEAK IT MAKES ME FEEL SO PROUD TO REPRESENT THE LABOR MOVEMENT AND THINK ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE THAT IT MAKES IN SO MANY WORKERS LIVE. UNFORTUNATELY MANY WORKERS DO NOT HAVE THAT PROTECTION AND ON THEY ARE LITERALLY FORCED TO CONFRONT THESE KINDS OF SITUATIONS AND KNOWING THEY HAVE TO DO THEIR JOB OR THEY WILL BE FIRED THEY CAN'T SIMPLY LEAVE THE ROOM. THEY CAN'T SIMPLY REFUSE TO CLEAN THE ROOM I'M AND I I THINK THAT THESE VERY COURAGEOUS HOUSE KEEPERS HAVE REALLY HELPED TO FUEL THIS MOVEMENT AND TO SAY. THAT AND THE FIGHT FOR SAFE WORKPLACES AB FOR FAIR TREATMENT FOR WOMEN AND FOR RESPECT ON THE JOB I'M GOES BEYOND A HOLLYWOOD GOES BEYOND REALLY ANY PARTICULAR INDUSTRY. AND IS MOST IMPORTANT FOR SOME OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE WORKERS ONE THING THAT PEOPLE OFTEN DON'T REALIZE ABOUT HOTELS. IS HOW OFTEN HOTELS THESE DAYS I'M CONTRACT OUT THE WORK OF HOUSEKEEPING EITHER THROUGH TEMP AGENCIES OR OTHER LABOR CONTRACTORS WHICH MAKES THESE PROBLEMS EVEN HARDER TO ADDRESS. BECAUSE IT GIVES THE AYE THE COMPANY RUNNING THE HOTEL AND A LACK OF ACCOUNTABILITY BECAUSE THEY THEY CAN SAY ALL THAT'S UP TO THE CONTRACTOR TO DEAL WITH THEIR NOT MY EMPLOYEES IT'S NOT MY JOB TO PROTECT THEM. THAT MAKES THESE PROTECTIONS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE WORK OF THIS COMMITTEE AND STRENGTHENING THIS BILL. ON ONE COMMENT I WOULD MAKE THEIR IT IS AN ISSUE AROUND A EMPLOYERS CALLING LAW ENFORCEMENT DIRECTLY WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF THE WORKER AND. WE ARE FINE TAKING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS I WOULD JUST FLAG THAT IS ONE OF THE MAJOR OBSTACLES FOR WOMEN IN THIS INDUSTRY AND FOR SO MANY IMMIGRANT WOMEN WORKERS. I'M IS THAT THE FEAR OF POLICE BEING INVOLVED IF IT'S A DETERRENT FROM REPORTING THESE KINDS OF ABUSES SO WE HOPE THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THIS COMMITTEE TO REFINE THAT LANGUAGE AND MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT. CREATING ANY DISINCENTIVES OFFER WORKERS TO COME FORWARD THANK YOU THANK YOU. GIVEN OTHER LESS. THAT THAT ALRIGHT ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. GIVE US YOUR NAME AND YOUR AFFILIATION PLEASE.

THIS BILL WELL WILL GIVE US A VICE BANK AND PROTECTION. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. SEEING NONE IS THERE OPPOSITION MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I'M JOHN CALDWELL REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA HOTEL LODGING ASSOCIATION. WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE UP THE COMMITTEE FOR THE THOROUGH AND FAIR ANALYSIS OF THE BILL. SPECIALLY THE PROBLEMS RAISED BY THE BLACK LIST PROVISIONS. WE THINK THE AUTHOR LOVE REMOVING THAT PROVISION. OUR MEMBERS ARE IN THE PROCESS OF REVIEWING THE EXTENT OF AMENDMENTS AND LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING IT IN PRINT WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR TO RAISE ANY ADDITIONAL CONCERNS. THANK YOU. I HOPE MARTY FISHER ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE I ECHO THE SAME REMARKS OF MY COLLEAGUE. A WE ALSO APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENTS AND THE AUTHOR TAKEN THEM. WE STILL NEED TO REVIEW THE AMENDMENTS ONCE OR IN PRINT AND REVIEW WITH OUR MEMBERS AND SEE. HOW IT IMPACTS OUR OUR CONCERNS OF FOR CONSISTENCY WITH OTHER OTHER REQUIREMENTS REGARDING SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND? ASSAULT VICTIMS. ALONG WITH OUR WE STILL HAVE A CONCERN ABOUT THE EXPANSION OF THE PAID LEAVE REQUIREMENT ESPECIALLY AS IT RELATES TO OTHER PAID LEAVE REQUIREMENTS. AND LEAVE OTHER LEAVE REQUIREMENTS. SO THIS TIME WE STILL REMAIN OPPOSED BUT WE WILL CONTINUE TO REVIEW THE LANGUAGE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS VERY BRIEFLY MIKE FOLLOWED ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA LODGING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION WHERE AN INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION OF SMALL LODGING PROPERTIES OF FROM ONE TO IT. PERHAPS A FIFTY ROOMS A USUALLY INDEPENDENTLY OWNED. WE OBVIOUSLY WE SHARE. THE STATEMENTS MADE IN THE ANALYSIS THAT THE BILL IS DIFFICULT TO OPPOSE CONCEPTUALLY. ABOUT THE DETAILS IT'S ABOUT HOW IT MAY APPLY TO SMALL LODGING PROPERTIES WOULD LIKE TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE LANGUAGE BUT WE WOULD ACKNOWLEDGE AND EVERYONE SHOULD ACKNOWLEDGE. YOU ALL BUT SOME YEARS AGO MADE IT VERY CLEAR UNDER THE LAW THAT IF A CUSTOMER IS HARASSING AN EMPLOYEE OF THE BUSINESS WHETHER LODGING OR LOBBYING OR ANYTHING ELSE. THE EMPLOYER HAS A RESPONSIBILITY TO TAKE REASONABLE STEPS TO STOP IT. SO WE ALREADY TAKE A VERY SERIOUSLY THE POSSIBILITY OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT OF EMPLOYEES IN THESE LODGING PROPERTIES BECAUSE THAT OBLIGATION EXISTS NOW REGARDLESS OF WHERE THE YOUR HOTEL OR A RESTAURANT OR A. OR ANY OTHER BUSINESS SO WE'D LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR AND SEEING HOW IT APPLIES TO SMALL BUSINESSES. SMALL PROPERTIES AND SEE WHAT WE CAN WORK OUT. THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. GIVE US YOUR NAME AND YOUR AFFILIATION PLEASE THANK YOU SHAUN LOSE THE NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT BUSINESS REPRESENTING SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS ALSO AT THIS TIME STILL OPPOSE THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING CHECK TWENTY MEMBERS MICHELLE RESTS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION WHICH YOUR ARE REVIEWING THE AMENDMENTS AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR THINKING.

I DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER TO THIS I'M CONCERNED ABOUT TAKING THE AMENDMENT THAT WOULD FORCE ON THE EMPLOYEE TO INTERACT WITH THE PLEASE. SO I HOPE AS WE MOVE THROUGH THIS WE CAN FIND SOME SORT OF SITUATION I UNDERSTAND ON A VIOLENT CRIME MAYBE THAT MIGHT BE NECESSARY BUT. IT IT IT'S COMPLICATED RIGHT I MEAN WE DO WANT THIS TAKING CARE BUT WE WANT TO PROTECT. EMPLOYEES WHO ARE GONNA. VERY. UNIQUE SITUATION IN THIS INDUSTRY LARGELY IMMIGRANTS. THAT MAY DETER THEIR ACTUAL. TELLING THEIR EMPLOYER TO DEAL WITH A SITUATION IF IT COULD BE DEALT WITH WITHOUT POLICE INTERVENTION SAU I I JUST I DON'T KNOW I I DON'T I FEEL BAD BRINGING IT UP BECAUSE THEY MUST FEEL LIKE. PROBLEM ON BOTH SIDES WE ALSO WOULDN'T WANT. I WEHAVE LAWS TO PROTECT EMPLOYEES NOW AGAINST US BUT WE WENT WILL IT WOULDN'T WANT AN EMPLOYER COLLEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT AS A MECHANISM TO. HARM EMPLOYEE I'M NOT SITUATION SO WITH EMPLACED ALL COULD COME BACK. AND SO I'M SURE YOU WILL. DEAL WITH KIND OF TRYING TO FIGURE THAT POINT OUT I JUST WANT THINK THAT REAL EFFORT SPEAKING. BEAUTIFULLY ABOUT HER EXPERIENCE IT'S A HARD THING TO COME UP AND TALK ABOUT. AND. SHE DID A GREAT JOB IN DOING SO AND I KNOW SHE CAN UNDERSTAND LISA. THANK YOU MISSOURI. I TO WANT TO THANK OF YOUR LUGGAGE IS BUT I THAT OF ANY OF THE OTHERS AT THE STEAM ON YOU IS MORE IMPORTANT THOUGH EVEN IF THAT. GUY WITH THE LLAMAS IMPORTANT THE BUT AGAIN FINA IS AGAINST IT ITSELF THAT I CAN GET THE MOST BUT THE HIT CHINA I. THEN THE OTHER I THINK IS MISTER BILL OATES THAT. THAT THE LAWS ARE ALREADY THERE THE EMPLOYER HAS A RESPONSIBILITY TO. TAKE CARE OF A COMPLAINT WHEN IT DOES LAUNCHED BY AN EMPLOYEE BUT IT'S CLEAR FROM STORIES LIKE OF YOUR LIFE AND YOUR LAND THE. THAT THIS DOES NOT HAPPEN AND IT THERE HAS TO BE SOMETHING MORE THAT'S DONE TO PROTECT. THESE EMPLOYEES I I DO THANK YOU FOR PRESENTING THIS BILL. AND LOOK FORWARD TO SUPPORTING IT.

KILEY NO MAIENSCHEIN. RACE. REYES I. NEEDS TO MORE FOR THE LONG HAUL. SO NOW WILL MOVE TO ITEM NUMBER THIRTEEN AB THIRTY ONE THIRTY EIGHT SOMERS ITCHY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. I'VE MOVING ONTO A AB THIRTY ONE THIRTY EIGHT THIS BILL. PROPOSES TO STRENGTHEN. THE PENALTIES TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE ARE BY FACILITIES LIKE REFINERIES THAT HANDLE HIGHLY TOXIC AND FLAMMABLE CHEMICALS. TO PREVENT ACCIDENTS THAT MY POST SERIOUS RISKS TO THE PUBLIC AND TO THE ENVIRONMENT. AS THIS COMMITTEE KNOWS THE CERTIFIED UNIFIED PROGRAM AGENCIES. OR COOPER. OVERSEAS CALIFORNIA'S ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM OR CAL ARE. TO PREVENT THE RELEASE OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS FROM. THESE TYPE OF. FACTORIES MANUFACTURES REFINERIES FACILITIES THAT DEAL WITH A HIGHLY TOXIC AND FLAMMABLE MATERIAL. SUCH AS THIS CHEVRON. RICHMOND REFINERY OR THE TORRANCE REFINERY IN MY OWN DISTRICT. THE COOP WAS ENSURE THAT THESE FACILITIES ARE ACCOUNTABLE AT THE SAFETY OF THE WORKERS AS WELL AS THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITIES. A TO ANTICIPATE PROBLEMS AND PREVENT ACCIDENTS THAT MIGHT MIGHT POSE SERIOUS RISKS TO THE PUBLIC AND THE ENVIRONMENT. THE CURRENT LAW ARE ONLY ALLOWS A MAXIMUM DAILY PENALTY OF TWO THOUSAND PER VIOLATION PER DAY WHICH IS NOT AN ADEQUATE DETERRENT FOR VIOLATIONS. THIS BILL PROPOSES TO INCREASE THE DAILY PENALTY FOR CALABRO GRANT VIOLATIONS FROM TWO THOUSAND FIVE THOUSAND. PER VIOLATION PER DAY. ALSO THIS BILL SEEKS TO UPDATE THE STANDARD FOR THE MAXIMUM CIVIL OR ADMINISTRATIVE LIABILITY COUNTY. TO WHEN A FACILITY KNOWINGLY. VIOLATES OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT THEY WERE VIOLATING CAL ARE VIOLATIONS. AND FINALLY THIS BILL ELITES. THE REASON OR NOTICE REQUIREMENT. OF THE VIOLATION BEFORE FACILITY CAN ASSESS THE MAXIMUM DAILY PENALTY OF TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND. A YEAR EXCELLENT COMMITTEE ANALYSIS HIGHLIGHTS THE REAL. HURDLES THAT THIS A REASONABLE NOTICE REQUIREMENT HAS. POSE TO. ASSESSING. THIS MAXIMUM PENALTY IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THE ULTIMATE EFFECT OF. A SAFER COMMUNITIES. FOR FOR US ALL. THIS BILL. WILL CREATE A GREATER DETERRENT EFFECT ON THESE FACILITIES TO PREVENT SERIOUS VIOLATIONS PROTECT THE WORKERS IN THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITY. OF COMPROMISE WITH THE OPPOSITION REGARDING MOST OF THEIR AMENDMENTS BUT. WITH. CONTINUE TO. ASSERT THE NEED FOR OF THE STANDARD OF WHEN THE MAXIMUM PENALTY CAN BE APPLIED. A TWO OF THIS KNOWING OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN STANDARD. GA WITH ME IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL IS JUST IN MILAN ON BEHALF OF THE COOPERS WHO ARE SPONSORING THIS BILL. THANK YOU FIRST WHAT MONNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS JUST MOVE ON BEHALF OF THE COOPERS. THIS BILL REALLY IS OVER DO YOU I'VE BEEN WORKING WITH HIM FOR NEARLY TWENTY YEARS SINCE THE INCEPTION OF THE PROGRAM IS THE FIRST TIME. THIS PENALTY HAS BEEN UPDATED AYE YOU MAY RECORD I DON'T IF CAME TO COMMITTEE BUT. THERE WAS A BILL LOST HERE THAT I PAID AT THE HAZARDOUS WASTE. A LOW'S AND THE PENALTIES TO SEVENTY THOUSAND. SO THIS IS TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND THIS IS ABOUT A THIRD OF THAT. I'M I ALSO WANT TO STRESS THAT YOU KNOW WE HAVE TAKEN AMENDMENTS THAT THE INDUSTRY REQUESTED AND HE SEEMS TO BE THAT THEY STUCK ON THIS ISSUE AN OPPOSING THIS WHOLE BILL. BECAUSE HAVE ONE ISSUE AND THAT IS. IT SEEMS UNREASONABLE FOR ENFORCEMENT AGENCY TO HAVE TO GIVE NOTICE. PRIOR TO IMPOSING A FINE AND PENALTY. BECAUSE WE'VE HAD A SITUATION APRAXIA NOT TO MENTION THE REFINERIES WE'VE HAD SOME SERIOUS EXPLOSIONS ACCIDENTS FIRES. BUT PRAXAIR AND HER ANHYDROUS AMMONIA WAS RELEASED THREE TIMES. AND THE CURRENT GLOBAL REQUIRES US TO GIVE NOTICE BEFORE WE CAN ISSUE THAT FINAL PENALTY SYDNEY THAT THE MAXIMUM FINE AND PENALTY. SO THAT'S RATHER ASININE REALLY DO THINK ANY ENFORCEMENT AGENCY HAS ITS HANDS TIED BEHIND ITS BACK AND GO TO RADIO WAITS UNTIL THERE'S A SERIOUS VIOLATION. UNTIL WE CAN TAKE THIS ENFORCEABLE WOULDA. THE OTHER THING THAT TIME THE INDUSTRY IS OPPOSED TO DESPITE HAVING TAKEN PRETTY MUCH ALL THE OTHER AMENDMENTS. IS THERE SAYING THAT THE STANDARD IS CHANGED. WHAT WE A CERTAIN I THINK THE AUTHORS COMPLETELY CORRECT? IF YOU HAVE DRAFTED A RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN. YOU SHOULD KNOW WHAT'S IN THAT RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN AND IF YOU THEN BEHIND BEHIND THE FACT THAT YOU DIDN'T KNOW THAT IT HAPPENED. AND YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE A SIGNIFICANT FINE AND PENALTY I ISSUED EVEN IF IT WAS A SERIOUS VIOLATION THAT ALSO SEEMS A LITTLE ASININE. IF YOU HAVE A RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN YOU SHOULD KNOW WHAT'S IN THE PLAN. YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT YOU VIOLATE THAT THE PLAN AND SHOULD SUFFER THE CONSEQUENCES SO WE CERTAINLY DON'T BY. THIS ARGUMENT FROM THE INDUSTRY. TO TRY AND REDUCE ITS FINDS DOWN TO FIVE FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS A DAY. THAT'S A PITTANCE FOR SOMETHING AS LARGE AS A REFINERY AND IT'S CERTAINLY NOT A DETERRENT. AND UNFORTUNATELY OUR PRINCIPAL WITNESS YEAH THE LA COUNTY FIRE DEPARTMENT WAS UNABLE TO MAKE IT APPEAR THAT THEY HAVE EXPERIENCED TORRANCE FIRE. THEY ALSO HAVE EXPENSIVE IN RICHMOND AND THEY KNOW THAT THESE INCIDENTS. SEE IT SERIOUSLY JEOPARDIZE THE COMMUNITY IN THE WORKERS AND WE THINK THIS IS A VERY VERY SMALL UPGRADE. I FIND THAT'S NECESSARY TO ACT AS THE PARENT BEFORE NOT OFTEN. INCIDENTS ARISE THANK YOU. THERE OPPOSITE. AS HAVING LIVED IN LOS ANGELES FOR TWENTY YEARS AND SEEN A NUMBER OF TIMES. WITH TORRANCE INDEED THE SITUATION REALIZE THAT TIME FOR BOTH A. SHALL WE SAY CHEVRON UNDERGOES A CONDO AND DOWN THERE IN THE TORRANCE AREA THAT. ENFORCEMENT IS SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT AND IT SEEMS LIKE THEY DO NOT TAKE IT SERIOUSLY SORRY GUYS. THANK YOU OTHERS IN SUPPORT. EIGHT CALMLY WITH LA COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS IN SUPPORT. IF YOU OTHERS IN SUPPORT. ALRIGHT SAY NONE OPPOSITION. I'M GENE URBAN I REPRESENT ENDEAVOR. AT THE OUTSET I WON A CONTEST THE MISREPRESENTATION OF OUR POSITION BY THE PROPONENT OF THE BILL. I GUESS OUR POSITION IS EITHER ASININE OR LITTLE ASININE DEPENDING ON HIS MISREPRESENTATION OF OUR POSITION. WE OBJECT TO THE CONFLATION OF INTENTIONAL MISCONDUCT WITH NEGLIGENCE I DON'T THINK THAT'S A RADICAL POSITION. THAT SHOULD BE WELL UNDERSTOOD BY MEMBERSHIP JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. TYPICALLY INTENTIONAL MISCONDUCT. PUNISHED MORE SEVERELY THAN NEGLIGENCE. WHAT WE OFFER? WAS TO INCREASE THE PENALTY FROM TWO THOUSAND TO FIVE. SUBDIVISION AT. TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY PERCENT INCREASE. WE OFFER TO DELETE. PREVIOUS NOTICE REQUIREMENT. UNLIKE AS REPRESENTED BY MISTER MALIGN WE OFFER TO DELETE IT. IN SUBDIVISION BE SO THAT THEY'VE KNOWING VIOLATION WOULD NOT HAVE TO HAVE A. SHE DIDN'T NOTICE WE'RE NOT GOING TO CONTEST MY CLAIM IS A CONTEST NOTICE. KNOWING VIOLATIONS ON THE BASIS OF A RECEIPT OF THE NOTICE. IF WE VIOLATED KNOWINGLY WE SHOULD BE SUBJECT TO TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS. HER DAY. HOWEVER WE STRENUOUSLY OBJECT TO THE CONFLATION OF NEGLIGENCE AND INTENTIONAL MISCONDUCT UNDER A SINGLE PENALTY OF TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND. I ALSO ASK WHAT IS A COVER. IF IF BE COVERS TWENTY FIVE INTENTIONALLY NEGLIGENCE ARE YOU NOW IMPOSING STRICT LIABILITY ON US. INCREASING IT FROM TWO TO FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS PER DAY IS THAT WHAT. IT'S BEING PROPOSED STRICT LIABILITY. AT FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS PER DAY. FOR WHAT COULD BE HUNDREDS OF PAGES OF DOCUMENTS IN A PLAN THAT THAT'S NOT GOOD POLICY. IT AND IT'S NOT IT IT IT'S NOT NECESSARY WE LAST YEAR WE SUPPORTED INCREASES AND AND THE PENALTIES AND EIGHTY SIX SEVENTY. THERE ARE. TONS OF PENALTIES TO WHICH WE ARE SUBJECT IF IN FACT THERE IS A SERIOUS INCIDENT WE ARE ALSO UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS BILL LIABLE FOR ACTUAL RESPONSE COST. IN ADDITION TO ALL THE OTHER COMMON LAW TOWARD SH TOWARDS FOR WHICH WE WOULD HAVE LIABILITY. OUR OFFER REMAINS THE AUTHOR SHOULD KNOW THAT WE WOULD INCREASE THE EXISTING PENALTY IN SUBDIVISION A. FROM TWO TO FIVE THOUSAND. WE WOULD AGREED TO DELETE THE NOTICE REQUIREMENTS AND SUBDIVISION DE WHILE PRESERVING THE TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR PENALTY FOR A KNOWING VIOLATION. THE OTHER ISSUE THAT WE'VE ASKED. TO BE ADDRESSED AND HAS NOT YET BEEN ADDRESSED AS TO WHICH CONDUCT IS NEWS INCREASE PENALTIES APPLY. SHOULD APPLY TO CONDUCT THAT OCCURS HONOR AFTER THE FIRST OF THE YEAR IT SHOULD BE PROSPECTIVE THAT ISSUE HAS NOT BEEN ADDRESSED. OUR POSITION IS EMINENTLY REASONABLE AND. I RESENT THE MISS THE DISTORTION OF IT. AND WE ASK THAT WHAT WE OFFER YOU BEFORE SIR YOU ACCEPT. AND I TRUST THAT COMMITTEE RATHER THAN THE I'M SOFTER HIM SORRY WE WE WE WOULD REQUEST THAT THE. AMENDMENTS THAT WE OFFERED THE AUTHOR THE ACCEPTED I CAN REPEAT THEM AGAIN THEY'RE VERY FAIR IT WAS. CHARACTERIZED BY MISTER QUIRK IN THE PREVIOUS COMMITTEE IS A CHINA HAS TO OFFER. WE WOULD INCREASE THE ABILITY NEED YOU TO WRAP UP. WE WOULD INCREASE A FROM TWO TO FIVE. WE WOULD DELETE THE NOTICE REQUIREMENT AB AND WE WOULD ASK FOR CLARITY ON TO WHICH CONDUCTIVITY NEW PENALTIES. TAX. THANK THANK YOU. I'M. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MARKET PARKS WITH THE WESTERN STATES PETROLEUM ASSOCIATION. WITHOUT REPEATING WHAT MR URBAN IS THAT WE BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE OFFERED I'M. A REASONABLE COMPROMISE. WAS OUR SUGGESTION TO INCREASE THE PENALTIES FROM TWO TO FIVE AND AND COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND THE DESIRE TO. ATTRACT THE NOTICE PROVISION WE THINK THAT THAT'S FAIR AND WORK I'M VERY WILLING TO ACCEPT THAT AND. AND MR IRVINE'S POINT AND THINK IT IS FAIR TO RETAIN NOT KNOWING PROVISION AND THE WAY THAT WE LOOK AT THIS. I'M CURRENT LAW PROVIDES A TWO PART TEST THERE MUST BE A NOTICE AND THE. THE VIOLATION MUST BE FOUND TO HAVE BEEN A KNOWING VIOLATION SO WHAT WE PROPOSE IS A REDUCTION OF A TWO PART TEST ONE PART TEST. AND AGAIN INCREASE A PENALTY WHICH WE BELIEVE IS FAIR I'M AND WE THINK THAT WITH THIS KNOWN I SHOULD HAVE NO LANGUAGE WE REALLY ARE CONFLATING. AND. VIOLATIONS THAT ARE SERIOUS AND VIOLATIONS WHICH ARE NOT. AND SO WE WOULD. UNFORTUNATELY ASKING YOUR OPPOSITION ON THIS BILL ON. AND WHAT ENCOURAGE SOME SOME FURTHER THOUGHT ON. I MAINTAINING THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN THESE TWO TYPES OF VIOLATIONS. THANK YOU OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. ADAM LIKELY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE WE ALSO REMAIN IN OPPOSITION. JOHN KEPT HIM BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA COUNCIL FOR ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECONOMIC BALANCE AND CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURERS AND TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION BOTH OPPOSED FOR THE REASONS STATED THANK YOU. TOM JACOB ON BEHALF OF THE CHEMICAL INDUSTRY COUNSEL OF CALIFORNIA OF THOSE FOR THE REASONS ARGUE. P. MONTGOMERY ON BEHALF OF THE CIVIL JUSTICE CESSATION OF CALIFORNIA AND THE AMERICAN CHEMISTRY COUNCIL IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. IT'S NONE OF BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. QUESTIONS COMMENTS. IT'S CUNNINGHAM. THANK YOU. SOME. ARE OF ANY PROBLEM WITH CHANGING THE FINE AMOUNT. BY VIRTUE OF. INFLATION IF NOTHING ELSE IF YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A DETERRENT EFFECT. FINES HAVE TO BE INCREASED OVER TIME IN SOME FASHION I DO HAVE AN ISSUE WITH THE STANDARD. AND THE CONFLATION AS IT'S BEEN PUT. OF THE STANDARD BECAUSE IT DOES OCCUR TO ME THAT. I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE HISTORY OR WHATEVER NOT. SUPER INTERESTED IN THAT BUT. IN TERMS OF A FINAL WORK PRODUCT I MEAN IT IS FAIRLY STANDARD IN LAW TO HAVE. ONE SET OF FINES FOR. AND NEGLIGENCE TYPE ACTIVITY OR WHERE THERE'S PROOF THAT SOMEBODY SHOULD HAVE KNOWN ABOUT A PROBLEM THEY WERE NEGLIGENT NOT KNOWING. AND ANOTHER HIGHER STANDARD. IN MORE SEVERE PENALTY. WHEN A CAN BE PROVEN THAT SOMETHING WAS DONE WITH INTENT. THIS BILL AS I UNDERSTAND IN ITS PRESENT FORM WOULD. CONFLATE THOSE TO STANDARDS AND I GUESS MY QUESTION TO. OF THE AUTHOR THE WITNESS ABOUT IS WHAT IS WHAT IS THE RATIONALE FOR DOING THAT IT DOES SEEM TO BE A VERY COMMON. DISTINCTION AND IN THE LAW ONE THAT I THINK DOES HAVE SOME POLICY. RATIONALE BEHIND IT. IN THAT YOUR SOCKING PEOPLE WITH A BIGGER FINE IF THEY. SCREWED UP AND KNEW ABOUT IT. AND THEY DID SO WITH SENT WITH SOME INTENT AND IN THIS INSTANCE I THINK THE. MATH TURNS OUT TO BE LIKE FIVE TIMES THE AMOUNT FINANCES SIGNIFICANT THAT'S MORE THAN TRIPLE DAMAGES PERCIVAL. FOR INSTANCE SO WHAT'S THE RATIONALE FOR. HAVING THAT STANDARD BE THE SAME. SO. THANK YOU MISTER CUNNINGHAM AS. FORMER ATTORNEYS. I THINK WE BOTH SHARE. BUT IN APPRECIATION FOR DIFFERENT LEVELS OF OF PENALTIES FOR A DIFFERENT LEVELS OF A. OF ARE CULPABILITY. THE ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION IS. AS. OUTLINED AND THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS WHERE WE'RE GIVEN THE AND PARTICULARLY. THIS IS SERIOUS AND SIGNIFICANT TELL A POTENTIAL HARM THAT CONNECTS THAT CAN. NOT OCCUR. NO AT REFINERIES AND AND AT OTHER STATIONARY FACILITIES AT THIS BILL IS TRYING TO ADDRESS THAT IS THE REASON WHY WE ARE PROPOSING. A TO GO BEYOND JUST THE KNOWING VIOLATION BUT ALSO THE CONSTRUCTIVE. KNOWLEDGE THEY SHOULD HAVE KNOWN ASPECT OF IT IF. IF A SUPERMARKET IS GOING TO BE HELD LIABLE. FOR THE MILK SPILLED ON THEIR FLOOR WHERE THEY SHOULD HAVE KNOWN NOT JUST THAT THEY KNEW THAT THE MILK WAS THERE BUT THEY SHOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT THE MILK WAS THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE. CONDUCTED THAT DUE DILIGENCE TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE PROVIDING A SAFE FACILITY. THEN WHY NOT REFINERIES WHY NOT BUT MANUFACTURES IT HANDLED THE MOST TOXIC CHEMICALS. THAT IS THE POINT WE NEED TO. YOU KNOW WEIGHT WHEN YOU'RE REPRESENTING GOT A A COMMUNITY LIKE I'M REPRESENTING WHERE YOU HAVE COMMUNITIES. THAT ARE. LIVING IN FEAR OF THE RELEASE OF POTENTIALLY TOXIC AND LETHAL CHEMICALS. WELL OR WHEN WHEN YOU KNOW AS WE SOUGHT IN THE RICHMOND FACILITY IN AS DESCRIBED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. YOU KNOW. WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT. THAT TO THE COOPER AS HAVE THE TOOLS NECESSARY TO ENFORCE UPON THE REFINERIES. TO NOT JUST OF PROTECT AGAINST KNOWING VIOLATIONS BUT THEN TO IMPOSE THIS. DUTY THAT THEY SHOULD KNOW AND THAT THEY SHOULD CONDUCT THE INSPECTIONS ARE NECESSARY TO PROVIDE THEIR SAFE FACILITIES AND THAT IS THE POINT OF. THE THE EXPANSION OF THE STATE. I APPRECIATE THAT ANSWER IT DOES RAISE THE QUESTION THOUGH THAN. THEN. UNDER IT UNDER THIS BILL. WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES WOULD? FALL UNDER THE SECOND PART FOR THE FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR LOWER AMOUNT AND IT'S. I'M STRUGGLING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S. WHAT? PART B. THEN WOULD ENTAIL IRWIN FACTUALLY THAT WOULD ARISE. MISTER CHAIR THROUGH YOU MISTER KENNY. WE WE CONCEDE THAT WE HAVEN'T ADDRESSED THE PROSPECT OF VERSES RETROSPECTIVE ISSUE YET AND WE DO INTEND TO DO THAT IT'S NOT AS THOUGH WE AREN'T GRAPPLING WITH THAT ISSUE. WE ALSO HAVE ADDRESSED THE ISSUE OF TO THE BEST OF OUR ABILITY BORDERS ARE. RELATIVELY PAPER VIOLATION IS VERSES A SERIOUS VIOLATION. BUT I THINK THAT THE OPPOSITION IS CONFLATING. THIS ISSUE ABOUT KNOWING OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN WE NOT SAYING ITS INTENT. THAT'S A DIFFERENT STANDARD. WE'RE NOT SAYING THESE FOLKS ARE INTENDING TO DO THIS. WE JUST SAYING IF YOU HAVE. PAID A RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN. AND YOUR IMPLEMENTING THAT RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN. AND SOMETHING GOES WRONG. YOU EITHER NEW OR YOU SHOULD HAVE NOT WE NOT EVEN SAYING YOU KNEW. BUT YOU SHOULD HAVE KNOWN. AND IT IS A QUESTION OF DUE DILIGENCE. WE CANNOT GO OFF TO THE FACT ONCE THE INCIDENT HAS OCCURRED ONCE THE FIRE HAS OCCURRED AND THEN IMPOSE A FINE AND PENALTY. OR LIKE IN THE CASE OF PRAXAIR RACK UP THE FREE VIOLATIONS BEFORE WE CAN STEP IN ND INDUSTRY HAS CONCEDED TO THAT POINT. THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO ISSUE NOTICE. ARE INTENT IS AN ENFORCEMENT AGENCY IT'S TO EXPECT THOSE PEOPLE IF THEY ARE WRITING A RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN. TO KNOW WHAT'S IN THE PLAN AND TO EXERCISE THE DO JUST DILIGENCE WE'RE NOT SAYING THAT INTENTIONALLY LIVING HERE A VALVE LEAK. WAYNE PINCH ME OPENING SOMETHING SO THAT'S REALLY WHAT THAT THE DISTINCTION IS FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE WE DON'T THINK THAT KNOWN OR SHOULD KNOW. IS SUCH A BIG STEP IF YOU ARE OBLIGATED TO WRITE THIS PAN AND FOLLOW IT. CAN I JUST BRIEFLY ASK THE OPPOSITION WITNESS TO ADDRESS THE THAT WE DO HAVE YOUR SPONSOR WHAT HE JUST SAID. WE'RE NOT SUGGESTING THERE'S NO LIABILITY FOR NEGLIGENT CONDUCT WE HAD KNOWLEDGE THAT WE'RE SIMPLY SAYING THAT THERE SHOULD BE A DIFFERENCE. IN THE PENALTY FOR NEGLIGENT AND INTENTIONAL MISCONDUCT. AGAIN NOT A RADICAL IDEA. THAT THAT'S ALL WE'RE SUGGESTING. WE WE OBJECT TO THE. EQUAL TREATMENT OF NEGLIGENT. MISCONDUCT AND INTENTIONAL MISCONDUCT IF WE PER PARA PLAYER AND AND VIOLATED OF COURSE WE HAVE SOME LIABILITY. THAT'S THE LOWER STANDARD. I DON'T BELIEVE IT'S UNUSUAL FOR SOMEONE TO COME UP HERE AND IT JACKED TO CONFLATING INTENTIONAL AND NEGLIGENT MISCONDUCT THEY'RE NOT THE SAME THEY HAVEN'T BEEN THE SAME FOR TWO HUNDRED YEARS WE WOULD SUGGEST A DIFFERENT PENALTY SHOULD ATTACH. WE'RE NOT ASKING FOR IMMUNITY. WE ACKNOWLEDGE YOUR SHOULD BE LIABILITY FOR NEGLIGENT BEHAVIOR BUT NOT THE SAME PENALTY AS INTENTIONAL MISCONDUCT. PICTURE. YEAH I IF I MAY I GUESS OR TWO IF I GREW WITH MISTER URBAN THERE THERE SHOULD BE DIFFERENT PENALTIES FOR. NEGLIGENT VERSES INTENTIONAL CONDUCT AND I. WILL COMMIT MYSELF TO WORKING WITH MR URBAN. TO MAKE THAT DISTINCTION MORE CLEAR THANK YOU. OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS. STILL LOOKING FOR A MOTION ON THIS BILL. SO THERE'S A MOTION. AND A SECOND THANK YOU IT SOUNDS LIKE THERE'S. GROUNDS FOR COMING TOGETHER ALSO SOUNDS LIKE THERE'S A LOT OF EMOTION GOING ON HERE. I WOULD SUGGEST WE RATCHET DOWN THE MOTION. AND GET TO THE USE BE. BECAUSE THERE'S OF. THERE'S A POTENTIAL. COMMON GROUND THAT I SEE. FROM MY STANDPOINT. THIS BILL IS WORTHY OF MOVING FORWARD. SEEMS LIKE YOU HAVE DOES WORK TO DO AND AND THAT IS FINE. AT THIS POINT IN THE PROCESS. THANK YOU. EACH OTHER QUESTIONS. WRITING NONE WE DO HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND MISTER WHERE TUTSI MICHAEL THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY. TO MOVE THE BILL FORWARD THAT TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THE BILL I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR I. THANK YOU MOTION ISSUE PASS. KALRA PLEASE STONE BY STONE AYE CUNNINGHAM. CHAU. CHAU I CHIU. GONZALEZ FLETCHER CONSULTS WATCHER I HOLDEN. KALRA. KILEY. KILEY NO MAIENSCHEIN. PRESS. REYES I. IT'S TWO MORE VOTES WILL PUT UP A LOT CALL ACCURATE. MS RUBIO THAT TAKES US TO ITEM NUMBER NINE A. B.. TWENTY SIX FORTY SEVEN GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN WAS OF THE COMMITTEE TODAY I'M HERE TO PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY SIX FORTY SEVEN. A BILL THAT WOULD MAKE EVIDENCE OF AN EMPLOYEE'S CRIMINAL HISTORY INADMISSIBLE AGAINST AN EMPLOYER IN A NAKED NEGLIGENT HIRING LAWSUIT BASED ON THE CONDUCT OF THE EMPLOYEE. ONE OF THE BIGGEST PUBLIC SAFETY CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE IN CALIFORNIA'S HELPING OUR EX OFFENDERS POT ARE EX OFFENDER POPULATION ACHIEVE SUCCESS. I'M SORRY AXES TO GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT. LAST YEAR I SUPPORTED. THE US AND THE LEGISLATURE PASSED ASSEMBLY BILL ONE ZERO ZERO EIGHT EFFECTIVELY KNOWN AS THE BAND BOX BILL. THIS BILL WAS PASSED WITH THE INTENT OF GIVING FORMALLY INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS AND INCREASED ACCESS TO EMPLOYMENT. CONSISTENT WITH THIS ATTEMPT AB TWENTY SIX FORTY SEVEN WILL FURTHER INCENTIVIZE COMPANIES TO HIRE PEOPLE WITH COMMENCEMENT CONVICTION HISTORIES BY PROVIDING LEGAL PROTECTIONS TO EMPLOYERS. AND POTENTIAL NEGLIGENT HIRING CIVIL CASES. IN ESSENCE MY BILL HERE TODAY WILL ESTABLISHED THAT AN EMPLOYER WILL NOT BE DEEMED NEGLIGENT WHEN HIRING AN APPLICANT WITH A CRIMINAL RECORD IF THERE IS NO RELATIONSHIP. BETWEEN THE NATURE OF THE INDIVIDUALS PREVIOUS CRIMINAL RECORD AND THE NATURE OF THE POSITION FOR WHICH THEY ARE HIRED. THIS PROTECTION FROM CIVIL LITIGATION MINIMIZES THE POTENTIAL FINANCIAL FALLOUT FIRST SMALL COMPANIES WHO ARE INTERESTED IN EXPANDING THEIR TALENT POOL BY HIRING PEOPLE WITH CRIMINAL RECORDS. IN ADDITION TO PROTECTING SMALLER COMPANIES FROM THE FINANCIAL IMPACT OF FACING A NEGLIGENT HIRING LAWSUIT. AB TWENTY FOUR SIXTY SEVEN WILL ALSO BENEFIT LARGER COMPANIES THAT ALREADY HAVE ESTABLISHED FAIR CHANCE HIRING PRACTICES THROUGH INDICTMENT INDEMNIFICATION FROM NEGLIGENT HIRING LAWSUITS BASED ON CRIMINAL RECORDS. FURTHERMORE. UP AB TWENTY FOUR SIXTY SEVEN PROVIDES A POSITIVE INCENTIVE FOR BUSINESSES AND THEIR EMPLOYEES. TO ADHERE TO ESTABLISH LAW. AND UPHOLDS MODEL FAIR CHANCE HIRING PRACTICES THAT ALL BUSINESSES SHOULD STRIVE TO INCORPORATE IN THEIR HIRING PROCESSES. WITH ME HERE TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT I HAVE LARRY TOM THOMSON ON BEHALF OF THE LOS ANGELES CHAMBER OF COMMERCE. THANK YOU. FIRST WITNESS PLEASE GOOD MORNING. AND THANK YOU. CHAIR AND MEMBERS. I MY NAME IS LARRY THOMPSON I'M WITH THE LA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE. AND. WE SUPPORT SOME SEVENTEEN HUNDRED BUSINESSES AND THE LOS ANGELES REGION. WE APPRECIATE ASSEMBLY MEMBER REELS. RUBIO'S HAIR INTRODUCTION AND WE ARE AND. PORT AND SPONSORS OF THIS LEGISLATION. STATE THAT OUR INTENT RELATIVE TO. TEN OVERWEIGHT IS TO FURTHER SUPPORT THE GOALS OF THAT LEGISLATION. WE BELIEVE THAT. THIS LEGISLATION THAT WERE SPONSORING IS IN CONCERT. AS WELL AS COMPLIMENTARY TO THAT LEGISLATION. ORGANIZATION. THE CHAMBER AS SUPPORTER PROP FORTY SEVEN. WE WOULD THE LARGE'S BUSINESS ORGANIZATION SUPPORT THAT LEGISLATION WE SUPPORTED PROP FIFTY SEVEN AS WELL. OF COURSE WAS SUPPORTING HERE TODAY. AND AND AND WE'VE GOT IT A CHALLENGE IN TERMS OF HIRING THE ET DE FORECAST FOR THE NEXT FIVE YEARS SAYS THAT CLEAR THE CALIFORNIA. WELL HIGHER OVER SIX. HOUSE HAS GIVEN ME SIX MILLION EMPLOYEES OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS. VERY VERY AGGRESSIVE OUTLOOK VERY AGGRESSIVE TARGET. AND FOR BUSINESSES TO MEET THAT DEMAND. SO WE SUGGEST THAT. WE GET NOMINAL NOMINAL MEASURE OF PROTECTION BUT IN THE HIRING PROCESS TO COMPLETE THAT GOAL AND OBJECTIVE. SO. IN CLOSING I SWEAR THANK YOU FOR. CONSIDERING THIS MEASURE. WE AGAIN. I BELIEVE THAT. RELATIVE TO TEN OH EIGHT. WE'RE NOT UNDERMINING THAT LEGISLATION IN ANY WAY IN FACT WERE SUPPORTED. THANK YOU. THANK YOU OTHERS IN SUPPORT. SEEING NONE IS THERE OPPOSITION YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN BYERS MURRAY QUE S. HARLOT THAT CALIFORNIA EMPLOYMENT LAWYERS ASSOCIATION. HERE RESPECTFULLY ON BEHALF OF A COALITION OF ORGANIZATIONS I'M IN OPPOSITION TO AB TWENTY SIX FORTY SEVEN. INCLUDING THE LEAD ADVOCATES OF AB TEN AWAY FROM JUST LAST YEAR SO FIRST I JUST WANT TO MENTION THAT. A. B. TENDO IT HAS BEEN ON THE BOOKS NOW FOR JUST FOUR WHOLE MONTHS SO WE THINK IT'S A LITTLE PREMATURE TO BE. WORKING ON. FOLLOW UP MEASURES TO THIS HISTORIC VICTORY THAT WE HAD JUST LAST YEAR TO HELP REDUCE BARRIERS TO EMPLOYMENT FOR PEOPLE WITH RECORDS. AB TEN KNOWING IT WAS A BILL AGAIN PASSED LAST YEAR THAT. PROHIBITS EMPLOYERS FROM ACQUIRING INTO CONVICTION HISTORY UNTIL AFTER A CONDITIONAL OFFERS MADE. AT THAT POINT THE EMPLOYER CAN. ASK ABOUT CONVICTION HISTORY BUT IS REQUIRED TO DO AN INDIVIDUALIZED ASSESSMENT UNDER A BE TEND A WAIT THERE'S A LIST OF FACTORS THAT THE EMPLOYER IS REQUIRED TO CONSIDER. IN DECIDING WHETHER OR NOT TO HIRE THAT PERSON. SO I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT THAT THE. THE THE CHAMBERS LETTERS STATES THAT AB TWENTY SIX FORTY SEVEN HELPS EMPLOYERS MINIMIZE THEIR EXPOSURE TO RISK GOING CONSIDERING APPLICANTS WHO HAVE CRIMINAL RECORDS. BY LEGALLY ESTABLISHING CLEARING CONCRETE PRACTICES A BUSINESS CAN FOLLOW TO AVOID ENOUGH BUDGET HIRING SU. BASED ON RECOGNIZED INDUSTRY GUIDELINES. AND I WOULD AB TWENTY SIX FORTY SEVEN DOES NOT DO THAT IT DOES NOT. PROVIDE CONCRETE PRACTICES A BUSINESS CAN FOLLOW THAT IS WHAT AB TEN NO WAY DID LAST YEAR. AB TUNNEL EIGHT AGAIN PROVIDE A CLEAR CONCRETE PRACTICES A BUSINESS CAN FOLLOW WHICH WOULD MINIMIZE THE REST WERE NEGLIGENT NEGLIGENT HIRING RISK ARE NEGLIGENT HIRING LAWSUIT. SO IF THE EMPLOYER FOLLOWS THE GUIDELINES THE GUIDANCE THE ROADMAP THAT'S PROVIDED IN IT AB TEN NO WAIT THEY WOULD BE MINIMIZING THE RISK TO ANOTHER AND HIRING LAWSUIT BECAUSE IT WOULD. SHOW THAT THEY WERE EXERCISING THEIR THEIR DUE DILIGENCE TO SEE IF THERE WAS ANY FORESEEABLE RISK. THAT THAT THIS NEW HIRE WOULD POSE HARM TO THE WORKPLACE. I'M. SO THIS ON THE OTHER HAND THIS JUST PROVIDES WHAT WE SEE AS AN OVERBROAD UNNECESSARY EVIDENTIARY EXCEPTION THAT REALLY JUST REINFORCES THESE HARMFUL STEREOTYPES AN INHERENT BIASES AB TEN ONLY. REALLY SOUGHT TO ELIMINATE. SO IF WE ARE IN FACT JUST TALKING ABOUT NEGLIGENT HIRING CLAIMS THIS BILL REALLY IS UNNECESSARY IT LAYS OUT THREE PROVISIONS ONE NO ONE ON CRIME CONVICTION HISTORY WOULD BE IN IT IT ADMISSIBLE. SO FIRST IT WOULD BE INADMISSIBLE IF IT DOES NOT BEAR A DIRECT RELATIONSHIP TO THE FACTS UNDERLYINGCIVIL ACTION. WHICH IS WHAT A RELEVANCY STANDARD IS FOR IF IF IT IS NOT RELEVANT IF THE INFORMATION IS NOT RELEVANT. IN OTHER WORDS IT DOES NOT BEAR DIRECT RELATIONSHIP TO THE FACTS UNDERLYING CIVIL ACTION THEN IT WOULD BE INADMISSIBLE. THE SECOND PRONG IT SAYS. THE INFORMATION IS INADMISSIBLE BEFORE THE. IF THIS CONVICTION IS SEALED REVERSED OR VACATED PARDON DISMISSED ARE EXPUNGED. AND ALL THOSE INSTANCES UNDER AB TEN AWAY AND UNDER LABOR CODE SECTION FOUR THIRTY TWO POINT SEVEN AND AN EMPLOYER COULD NEVER EVEN CONSIDER THAT CONVICTION HISTORY ANYWAY. SO THERE'S NO WAY THAT THE INFORMATION WOULD GO INTO ANOTHER HIRING LAWSUIT. THE THIRD PRONG SAYS OF THE CRIMINAL HISTORY CONSISTS OF AN ARRESTOR CHARGE A DID NOT RESULT IN A CRIMINAL CONVICTION AND AGAIN UNDER A BE TOTALLY AND UTTERLY BECAUSE ACTION FOR THIRTY TWO POINT SEVEN. AN EMPLOYER CANNOT CONSIDER THE INFORMATION THEY CANNOT CONSIDER AN ARREST THAT DOES NOT RESULT IN A CONVICTION SO THAT INFORMATION ALSO WOULD NOT COME IN FOR ANOTHER IN HIRING. LAWSUIT SO. IN THAT SENSE IT'S IT'S UNNECESSARY BUT THE BILL'S ALSO OVER BROUGHT IT DOESN'T APPLY JUST TO NEGLIGENT HIRING LAWSUITS APPLIES TO ANY ACTION ANY CIVIL ACTION AGAINST AN EMPLOYER AND EMPLOYERS AGENTS OR EMPLOYERS. OTHER EMPLOYEES SO THERE'S THIS WHOLE UNIVERSE OF OTHER CASES WHERE THERE MIGHT BE TORTIOUS CONDUCT WHERE A CRIMINAL CONVICTION HISTORY MIGHT ACTUALLY BE RELEVANT. I DO NEED EUROPE OKAY THE LAST THE LAST POINT IS THAT. IT'S IT'S ONE SIDED THIS BILL ONLY MAKES THE INFORMATION AND INVINCIBLE. AGAINST AN EMPLOYEE YOU'RE SO ACTUALLY UNDER THE SPELL OF A PLAINTIFF WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO USE CONVICTION HISTORY OTHER EVIDENCE AGAINST AN EMPLOYEE. AN EMPLOYER OR ITS AGENTS OR ITS EMPLOYEES. BUT THE EMPLOYER COULD ACTUALLY USE CONVICTION HISTORY AGAINST THE PLAINTIVE. SO YOU KNOW AGAIN IF WE THINK THAT THE GOAL IS TO ESTABLISH LEGALLY BUT TO LEGALLY ESTABLISHED CLEARING CONCRETE PRACTICES THE BUSINESS CAN FOLLOW TO AVOID A NEGLIGENT HIRING LAWSUIT. WE THINK THAT MEANS MAKING SURE WE'RE DOING THE EDUCATION OUTREACH ENSURING COMPLIANCE WITH A. B. TUNNEL AND SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE ARE OPPOSED. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS PLEASE PLEASE IF YOU CAN WITH THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA WHERE ALSO AND RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL ANALYSTS AT ECHO THE COMMENTS OF MISTER ISHIHARA. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. THREE ATTACK OR THE CONSUMER ATTORNEYS THE CALIFORNIAN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE I'M GONNA BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. THIS WILL BE I. APPRECIATE THAT THIS IS A COMPLEX CONVERSATION AND AND THAT TRYING TO SUPPORT. THOSE WITH CRIMINAL RECORDS GETTING INTO THE WORK FORCE AND HELPING BUSINESSES ACCOMPLISH THAT AND I THINK THAT'S THE BASIC GOAL HERE AND AND I THINK THAT'S. THAT'S A WORD THE NOTION. FOR ME THOUGH. THIS BILL DOESN'T REALLY DO THAT OR I DON'T THINK WE'LL IT WILL ACCOMPLISH THAT SO I'M NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT IT TODAY. AND IT DOES POTENTIALLY GO BEYOND WHAT. WHAT IT STATED AND THAT AND THAT DOES CONCERN ME WHERE? THOUGH BECAUSE THE CONVICTION INFORMATION OR THAT EVIDENCE USUALLY WE EXCLUDE THAT TO TO PROTECT THE INDIVIDUAL WHO IS BEING HIRED. AND A LOT OF THE EVIDENCE RULES WOULD ALREADY SUPPORT THE BUSINESS IN A NEGLIGENT HIRING SITUATION REMEMBER THE BAND THE BOX TO. PANTS THE BOX UP FRONT BUT STILL ALLOWS THE EMPLOYER TO DO THEIR DUE DILIGENCE ON THAT INDIVIDUAL AND HAVING RUN BILLS IN THIS AREA AND DEALING WITH A NUMBER OF. CATEGORIES OF INDUSTRY. WHO WERE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THAT? STATUTES THAT WE HAVE DONE SO THAT THEY DO HAVE THE ABILITY TO INTERVIEW AND AND. MAKE APPROPRIATE DECISIONS ABOUT EMPLOYEES WE WE'VE REALLY TRIED TO TO SORT OF WORK THAT THAT BALANCE SIDE WOULD RATHER THAT WE SEE WE GIVE THE LOVE. A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME. UNDERSTAND. BETTER THE EXTENT TO WHICH IT DOES REPRESENT ISSUES FOR BUSINESSES AND THAT AND THAT WE CAN FINE. TUNE THE LAW IN VERY SELECTED AREAS RATHER THAN THAN SOMETHING. QUITE SO BROAD AS THAT SO I I APPRECIATE THE NOTION AND AND WANTING TO HELP IN THIS AREA FOR ME RIGHT NOW JUST NOT SURE THAT THIS IS THE RIGHT APPROACH I'M NOT GOING TO BE A LIST. I THINK IT WHAT WITH ALL DUE RESPECT I THINK. THAT ONCE HE IN A PART OF THE A ONE ZERO ZERO EIGHT IS THAT ONCE THEY CHECK THE BOX THAT DIDN'T AND EMPLOYER IS. ABLE TO LOOK INTO THE BACKGROUND TO ME IN MY OPINION AND THE REASON THAT I I I. AND SPONSORING OR HELPING WITH THIS BILL IS BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE YES THEY DO. CHECK THE BOX OR THERE'S NO BOX TO CHECK THEY CHECK THE BACKGROUND AND THEN IT GIVES THE BUSINESS OF COVER TO SAY WELL YOU KNOW IF IT'S KIND OF A BORDERLINE OFFENSE FOR. I CAN EVEN GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE BUT IF THE BORDERLINE OFFENSE AND AND THE BUSINESS FEELS LIKE THEY HAVE COVER THEM THEY'RE MORE WILLING TO TAKE THAT CHANCE AS OPPOSED TO JUST SAYING ó NOW I HAVE. YOU KNOW A REASON NOT TO HIRE THE PERSON SO SO FOR ME THIS BILL REALLY DOES MY INTENTION IS REALLY TO GIVE COVER TO SOME OF THOSE BUSINESSES THAT ARE GOING TO TAKE A CHANCE ON SOME OF THESE EMPLOYEES. ARE POTENTIAL EMPLOYEES THAT WOULD OTHERWISE. AFTER. THE INITIAL OFFER WHEN THEY DO BACK THE BACKGROUND CHECK. MAY SAY UP WHAT IT THERE'S. YOU KNOW WHATEVER UP OFFENSE MAY BE. THERE AND SAY WELL I'M NOT GONNA YOU KNOW TITLES FOLKS AS OPPOSED TO GIVING THEM COVER SO THAT. THEY CAN SAY WELL I'M GOING TO TAKE A CHANCE BECAUSE NOW I HAVE COVER AND I AM ABLE TO. TO TO BE ASSURED THAT I WON'T BE HELD NEGLIGENT. IF I DO ARE THESE PEOPLE SO AGAIN WITH ALL DUE RESPECT I. I APPRECIATE THE THE CONVERSATION BUT I ALSO THINK THAT YOU KNOW TALKING ABOUT HOW QUICKLY WE WE FOLLOW UP ON ON A LOT THAT THAT'S THE NATURE OF THIS BUSINESS IS. YOU KNOW WE WE LOOK AT WHAT. WORKED THE LAST TIME AND TRY TO EXPAND AND HOPEFULLY MAKE I MAKE IT EASIER FOR THAT LOT TO TAKE INTO EFFECT FOR MONTHS YES IS A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME BUT YOU KNOW WE DO THIS ALL THE TIME IT'S NOT YOU KNOW FOR ME THAT REASON IS NOT. A GOOD ENOUGH REASON NOT TO DO SOMETHING BECAUSE THEY WERE JUST BASICALLY SAY NOT WHILE SOMEBODY ALREADY DID DID IT I'M NOT GONNA DO IT ANYMORE ITSELF. AGAINST AND I APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU OTHER QUESTIONS TO KILEY. I MEAN FOR THE WITNESS FROM THE LA CHAMBER COULD JUST MAKE IT A LITTLE MORE I CONCRETE FROM US I MEAN YOU'VE HEARD FROM YOUR MEMBERS THE SORT OF BAD SITUATION WHERE THIS NEW BASIS FOR AN ADMISSIBILITY MIGHT. HAVE AN IMPACT I MEAN WHAT KIND OF ACTIONS WOULD MY WOULD BE DEALING WITH WOULD BE SOMEONE WHO DID SOMETHING OUTSIDE THE SCOPE OF EMPLOYMENT OR WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THEIR EMPLOYMENT. BUT WHAT WE WE WE HOSTED A A FOCUS GROUP ABOUT SIX MONTHS AGO. AND AND AND TALKED AROUND WHAT ANY IMPEDIMENTS FOR FOR HIRING. AND AND THEN WHEN YOU'RE TALKING TO. A COMPANY WOULD LARGER A LARGER FIRM WITH THE WITH THE. LEGAL COUNSEL AND AND HOLD IT STAFF AVAILABLE. IT IS NOT AS CONCERNED WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT SMALL BUSINESSES YOU TALK ABOUT THE RISK THAT A SMALL BUSINESS RUNS. AND I'M AND POWER ARE ARE THEY WILLING WITH THE RISK THAT THEY MAY RUN TO TAKE THIS CHANCE AND AND WHAT WHAT WHAT WE'VE. HEARD IS. IT IT IT'S QUESTIONABLE AND SO. WE WANT TO ELIMINATE ANY REASON WHY PEOPLE WHO PREVIOUSLY WERE IN CHRIST READ OR HAVE SOME RADICAL SOME RECORD. ARE NOT HIGH. AND IT AND SO THAT'S THE GIST OF OUR OUR SUPPORT. I IT IS IT IS VERY VERY DIFFICULT THE DAY WE'VE WE'VE GONE THE COMPANY'S IN AND AND WE HAVE A MAJOR HIRING EFFORT IN THE CHAMBER TODAY. TO PLACE SOME FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE. THAT WERE AFFECTED BY PROP FORTY SEVEN WEEK WE'VE WE'VE WE'VE MADE A PLEDGE TO IN LA COUNTY TO LA COUNTY SUPERVISORS. TO TO TO ENABLE THE HIRING OF FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS. WE AND EIGHT IF YOU SIT DOWN AND TALK TO BUSINESSES LARGE AND SMALL. HOWEVER THEIR INTENTIONS ARE GREAT IT IS CHALLENGING TO DO THAT. IT IS CHALLENGING TO DO THAT SO WORST SAN. CUT LET'S ELIMINATE AS MANY QUESTIONS AS POSSIBLE LET'S ELIMINATE THE RISK IF POSSIBLE AND AND AND AND WHEN WE TALK ABOUT WHAT WE'RE DOING IN THIS IN IN IN THIS LEGISLATION. WHO WE BELIEVE US NOMINAL SO WHY NOT DO IT? YEAH JUST A QUICK FATHER MEAN GENERALLY I WILL TALK ABOUT GENERAL RESPONDENTS BICU OR LIABILITY. THAT'S KIND OF THAT STRICT LIABILITY FROM THE EMPLOYERS PUT YOU RIGHT THERE DE JUST AUTOMATICALLY FLOWS TO IT FROM THE EMPLOYEE I. TO THE EMPLOYER. I WANT YOU TO ESTABLISH NEGLIGENCE THERE. SO THIS WOULDN'T REALLY AFFECT THOSE ACTIONS SO JUST IT WOULD BACK SEPARATE NEGLIGENT HIRING ACTION SO WHY DO YOU THINK YOU WOULD PROVIDE. ANY SORT OF MEANINGFUL PEACE OF MIND TED HERE MEMBERS. AGAIN IF IF IF IF IF I'M A I'M THAT I'M GONNA HOLD IT MISS KILEY. YOU ASKED THE SIMILAR QUESTION YOU'RE ASKING BASICALLY TO SAY HAD THE SAME THING AGAIN I'M NOT SURE WHAT YOU FISHING FOR. YEAH THIS IS ACTUALLY MUCH. I'M JUST. I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND. BECAUSE YOU KNOW YOU HAVE DIFFERENT KIND OF ACTIONS LIKE A NEGLIGENT HIRING ACTION THAT YOU COULD HAVE JUST REGULAR RESPONDENTS PURE LIABILITY SO WHY IS THIS IS SPECIFIC TO EGGMAN HIRING YEAH AND I WHY IS NOT A PARTICULAR CONCERN THE FOLKS. IN TERMS OF HOW THIS NEW LAWS CAN IMPACT THAT OKAY THAT'S ESSENTIALLY THE QUESTION YOU ASKED BEFORE DON'T HAVE IT DIFFERENT NIGHT NO I DON'T SO. AND. MAY I APOLOGIZE FOR NOT BEING COLOR ARE. BUT. HAVE AG AT THAT MY RESPONSE. WAS ONE THAT. ANSWER THAT QUESTION. THIS RACE. AS A. JOINT AUTHOR OF AB ONE ZERO ZERO EIGHT I CAN TELL YOU WE WENT THROUGH. SO MUCH TO TRY TO GET THE RIGHT LANGUAGE TO GET. THE THE THE CHAMBER TO GET A NUMBER OF OTHER STAKEHOLDERS AT THE TABLE. TO PROVIDE THOSE PROTECTIONS NOT JUST FOR THE FORMALLY INCARCERATED BUT ALSO FOR THOSE EMPLOYERS WHO WERE GOING TO. GIVE THEM THE JOBS. AND IT INITIALLY WHEN I READ THE BILL I THOUGHT OKAY SO NAY OUT JUST A PROTECTION FOR THE EMPLOYER. BUT AS I READ THROUGH IT FURTHER I REALIZE THAT IF. IF THE OBJECTION IS. INTRODUCING RELEVANT. EVIDENCE THERE'S ALREADY OBJECTION FOR THAT SO IF IT'S IRRELEVANT TO WHATEVER THE ACTION IS IT'S NOT GOING TO BE ALLOWED TO BUY ANY JUDGE. IF A. B. ONE ZERO ZERO EIGHT OPEN DOORS AND ALLOWED. EMPLOYERS UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES READ THAT THEY DO CONDITION CONDITIONALS ó OFFER. THEY THEREAFTER CAN DO THE RESEARCH TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH THE HIRING OF A PARTICULAR PERSON DEPENDING ON THE TYPE OF CONVICTION. THEY'RE ALREADY THOSE PROTECTIONS FOR THE EMPLOYER. AND I THINK THAT. WHAT WE'RE SAYING IN THIS BILL IS? IF YOU'RE FORMALLY INCARCERATED ALTHOUGH YOU'VE PAID YOUR DEBT TO SOCIETY. YOU'RE OF BIGGER RISK. EVEN THOUGH YOU'VE ALREADY PAID YOUR DEBT TO SOCIETY AND THE WHATEVER THE CONVICTION WAS. HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE JOB. THAT'S WHY YOU WERE HIRED BECAUSE AT NOTHING TO DO WITH THE JOB WITH QUALIFICATIONS OF THE JOB TYPE I'M JUST CONCERNED. ABOUT AYE CONCERNED. WITH. WHAT THIS IS DOING? OUR UNDOING AB ONE ZERO ZERO EIGHT I'M JUST IN RESPONSE TO TO. THE THE QUESTION ABOUT THE JUDGE THE DECISION OF WHAT EVIDENCE IS INCLUDED ALWAYS RESTS ON THE JUDGE. AYE BUT NOT EVERY JUDGE IS IS YOU KNOW IS THE SAME WE ALL I'M OBVIOUSLY YOU GUYS KNOW BETTER THAN I. AND SO FOR ME IT THIS WOULD MAKE SURE THAT THE JUDGES WOULD BE CONSISTENT AND WHATEVER ON DECISIONS THAT MAKE OF WHAT EVIDENCE IS USED. IT'S JUST MY OPINION. OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS.

THANK YOU CALL THE ROLL PLEASE STONE BY STONE AYE CUNNINGHAM. CHOW. CHOW I CHIU. CHIU AYE GONZALEZ FLETCHER. CONSULT FUTURE AYE HOLDEN. HOLDEN I KALRA. KALRA AYE KILEY. KILEY AYE MAIENSCHEIN. MAIENSCHEIN I REYES. REYES I. THAT BILL IS OUT. THEY DO SOMETHING THAT TAKES US TO ITEM NUMBER TWELVE WHICH IS MY OWN AB THIRTY ONE OH NINE AND THEN WE WILL DO ITEM FIFTEEN. AB THIRTY TO FORTY NINE MISTER CUNNINGHAM BUT YOU. TAKE THE HELM PLEASE THIS IS ITEM TWELVE AB THIRTY ONE ON NINE MISTER CHAIR WHENEVER YOU'RE READY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS THIRTY. AB THIRTY ONE OH NINE ADDRESSES A COUPLE OF PROBLEMS THAT HAVE COME TO LIGHT OVER THE LAST YEAR OR SO. AND ONE IS. THE SITUATION OF NON DISCLOSURE AGREEMENTS THAT WOULD SILENCE SOMEONE WHO WE NEED TO COME FORWARD AND ESPECIALLY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SEXUAL HARASSMENT SEXUAL MISCONDUCT SUITS WE'VE SEEN. TOO MANY EXAMPLES INCLUDING SOME VERY FAMOUS ONE WAS SOME OLYMPIC CHIN JOURNALISTS AND OTHER OLYMPIC ATHLETES WHO WOULD SIGNED AGREEMENTS THAT. SHUT THEM DOWN AND ARE NOT ABLE TO BRING FORWARD THE CONVERSATION INTO A PUBLIC. SITUATION LIKE OURS. AND SO IT WOULD ENSURE THAT SOMEONE WHO HAD SIGNED A NON DISCLOSURE THAT THAT COULD NOT BE USED. IN AN AREA WHERE THERE'S JUDICIAL ADMINISTRATIVE OR LEGISLATIVE HEARINGS TO BRING OUT THAT INFORMATION. THE SECOND WOULD LIMIT SETTLEMENT PROVISIONS THAT PREVENTS AND EMPLOYER FROM SAYING. YOU'VE BEEN VICTIMIZED WE'RE KNOW SETTLING WITH YOU YOU CANNOT NOW COME BACK TO OUR ORGANIZATION WHICH IS SEEMS PATENTLY OFFENSIVE WE'VE SEEN IT HERE WE SEEN IT ACROSS A NUMBER OF ORGANIZATIONS WHERE SOMEONE WHO'S BEEN VICTIMIZED. GETS RE VICTIMIZED BECAUSE THEY LOSE THEIR JOB THEY LOSE THEIR CAREER THEY CANNOT COME BACK INTO THAT ORGANIZATION. THIS DOES GET TO BE. A CAN BE A SIGNIFICANT ISSUE AS WE DEFINE IT OR TRYING TO DEFINE. WHAT THAT ORGANIZATION IS WHO THAT THAT IS THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE ON THIS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE DEFINING IT VERY SPECIFICALLY I THINK IT'S CLEAR? IN A PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT CONTACTS GETS A LITTLE BIT MORE DIFFICULT AND PRIVATE EMPLOYMENT CONTACTS AND THAT'S WHY WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE CHAMBER TO SORT THROUGH DEFINITIONS AND ENSURE THAT WE HAVE. SOMETHING THAT WILL PASS THROUGH A BUT WILL ALSO REALLY START TO ADDRESS THAT ISSUE. THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL DOES THAT IS OUR INTENT AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR IBOOK. WHEN IT'S ISN'T SUPPORT. I THINK YOU KNOW MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AMERICA YOSHIHARU WITH THE CALIFORNIA EMPLOYMENT LAWYERS ASSOCIATION. I'LL KEEP MY COMMENTS BRIEF BUT I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS ONE OF THE MANY THINGS THAT ARE BECOME GLARINGLY OBVIOUS IN THE ME TOO MOVEMENT IS JUST HOW. PERNICIOUS AN OFFENSIVE SOME OF THE OPPRESSIVE SORRY ON SOME OF THESE SETTLEMENT TERMS CAN BE. IN PARTICULAR WITH HARVEY WEINSTEIN THE LARRY NASSER SOME OF THESE HIGH PROFILE CASES. I THINK THIS MISCONDUCT WAS ABLE TO CONTINUE BECAUSE OF THE NON DISCLOSURE AGREEMENTS THAT REALLY SILENCED THESE VICTIMS AND IN THE LARRY NASSER CASE IN PARTICULAR PREVENTED THEM FROM EVEN TESTIFYING IN A CRIMINAL PROCEEDING. THIS DOES HAPPEN IN THE EMPLOYMENT CONTEXT AS WELL. ONE OF OUR ATTORNEYS REPRESENTED FIVE INDIVIDUALS WHO WAS HARASSED BY THE SAME CEO OF THE COMPANY. ALL OF THE EMPLOYEES HAD TO SIGN NONDISCLOSURE AGREEMENT SOME OF THEM WERE PART OF A SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT SOME ARE JUST AS A CONDITION OF HIGHER. BUT THIS REALLY DID PREVENT THESE WORKERS FROM PARTICIPATING IN THE INVESTIGATIONS. WITH THEIR CO WORKERS WHO WERE AGAIN HARASSED OR ASSAULTED BY THE SAME PERPETRATOR. WITH REGARD TO THE NO REHIRE PROVISIONS AGAIN THIS HAS BECOME IS BECOMING STANDARD AND SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS WHICH AGAIN OFTEN ADDS INSULT TO INJURY WHEN SOMEONE'S TRYING TO RESOLVE THEIR CASE MOVE. AND FIND THAT IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO. TO MOVE ON IN THEIR CAREER FIND ANOTHER JOB BECAUSE OF THE SNOW RIGHT REHIRE PROVISIONS ONE OF OUR ATTORNEYS REPRESENT. REPRESENTED A WORKER WHO WAS SEVERELY SEXUALLY HARASSED AND ASSAULTED WHO WORKED FOR A LARGE TIME SHARE CORPORATION. SHE SETTLED THE CASE. SHE HAD TO AGREE TO A NO REHIRE PROVISION. SHE WORKS FOR AND SO SHEMOVED ON TO ANOTHER TIME SHARE COMPANY THAT WAS THEN ACQUIRED BY THE PREVIOUS TIME SHARE COMPANY AND SHE HAD TO LEAVE HER JOB SHE WAS TERMINATED JUST BECAUSE NOT NO REHIRE PROVISION. SO AGAIN WE THINK. THIS IS PROBABLY ALREADY COVERED UNDER THE RIGHT BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS CODE. SECTION SIXTEEN SIX HUNDRED ON THIS BILL WILL JUST MAKE THAT CLEAR THAT IT DID IT IS A CONSTRAINT ON. FINDING MEANINGFUL GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT AND FOR THOSE REASONS WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS BILL ENERGY SUPPORT. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. SEEING NOT OUT. SORRY. DON'T. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE JENNIFER BROWN BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND I DO WANT TO START OFF BY THANKING THE AUTHOR. I'M FOR WORKING WITH US IN A STAFF I'M FOR WORKING WITH THE DIFFERENT PROVISIONS OF THE BILL TO SORT OUT OUR CONCERNS WE HAVE NO CONCERNS WITH. PROVISION A OF THE BILL THAT THAT ESSENTIALLY TALKS ABOUT THE NONDISCLOSURE AGREEMENT WERE TOLD THE FINE WITH THE LANGUAGE IN THAT SECTION REALLY JUST FOCUSED ON THAT A NO REHIRE PROVISION. AND WHILE WE AGREE I'M WITH THE AUTHOR IN HIS INTENT. TO MAKE SURE THAT SOME EMPLOYEE WHO HAS. ORTIZ SUFFERED. ALLEGED HARASSMENT ETCETERA IT'S IN. RETALIATED BEGINS WITH THIS NO REHIRE CLAUSE WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PRIVATE SECTOR EMPLOYERS HAVE THE ABILITY IN CERTAIN SITUATIONS WHEN IT IS APPROPRIATE TO HAVE A NO REHIRE CLASS AND HAVE THAT DISCRETION TO CONTINUE TO UTILIZE UTILIZE THOSE PROVISIONS. IN THE APPROPRIATE CIRCUMSTANCES AND SO WE. AGAIN WORKING WITH HIM TO TRY AND FIX THAT LANGUAGE TO MAKE SURE THAT. IT ADDRESSES BOTH OF OUR CONCERNS WILL CONTINUE WORKING WITH THEM ON THAT THINKING. MR MEMBERS A JOHN TORTILLA. AS PART OF THE CIVIL JUSTICE SITUATION CALIFORNIA I'M PART OF THE COALITION. THAT HAS BEEN. WORKING ON THE SENATE WE DO AGREE THAT WERE VERY CLOSE. JUST WANT TO MAKE TWO POINTS ARM FOR A TESTIMONY ONE IS THAT THE INTENT OF THE BILL. AS LAID OUT IN SECTION ONE IS TO FOLLOW THE GOLDEN VERSES CALIFORNIA EMERGENCY PHYSICIANS. AT CASE. WHICH READS THEM WHICH IS WHERE WE GET THIS RESTRAINT OF A SUBSTANTIAL CARROT ON A PERSON'S ABILITY TO ENGAGE IN A LAWFUL PROFESSION. AND WERE A BIT CONCERNED THAT IN. ON PAGE FOUR WHEN YOU INCLUDE ALONG WITH STATE AGENCY EDUCATION SYSTEM. ON AND THE FINAL THING WHICH IS A BUSINESSES SO DOMINATES THE LABOR MARKET YOU INCLUDE ANY BUSINESS WITH FIVE OR MORE LOCATIONS IN THE STATE. ON THAT COULD BE TAKEN AS A SUBSTANTIAL RESTRAINT EVEN THOUGH A COURT WOULDN'T ACTUALLY FIND THAT IF SOMEBODY OWNS FIVE MCDONALDS IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN THAT NOT BEING HIRED AT ONE OF THOSE FIVE MCDONALDS IS GOING TO BE. THE ISSUE THE OTHER THING IS. PEOPLE GET ON UP FIRED AND THAT THEN SUE FOR ALL SORTS OF REASONS IS IN FACT. YOU COULD FIRE SOMEBODY WHO IS UNDER CONTRACT BECAUSE YOU BELIEVE THEY'VE BEEN SEXUALLY HARASSING THEIR CO WORKERS THAT PERSON COULD COME BACK AND DO A BREACH OF CONTRACT. YOU SETTLE THAT OUT BECAUSE IT'S CHEAPER TO SETTLE AND THAT PERSON COULD THEN COME BACK AND SAY WE WANT TO BE HIGHER AND SO. SO THAT THE CASES ARM THAT THAT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP A VERY SYMPATHETIC NEED TO BE HANDLED ON BUT I DO THINK WE HAVE TO HAVE THAT BALANCE OF. EMPLOYERS TO ON ACTUALLY DOING THE RIGHT FIT THING AND FIRE PEOPLE FOR. APPROPRIATE REASONS. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME ORGANIZATION HELLO KITTY HANSON WITH THE CALIFORNIA RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION AND WE'RE HERE WITH CONCERNS REGARDING THE RE HIGHER POSITIONS. UP FOR EMPLOYERS WITH FIVE LOCATIONS ARE MARK THINKING. SEEING NO OTHER WITNESSES I'LL BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS. JERRY MAKE CLOTHES AND I'M SUPPOSED TO ASK IF YOU'LL BE TAKING THE AMENDMENTS O.. YEAH THE TOUGH AMENDMENTS AND THAT WE'VE NEGOTIATED BUT YEAH WILL BE TAKING THE COMMITTEES OF ON. THANK YOU ANY CLOSER I ASK DERIVA. THERE'S A MOTION AND A SECOND I BELIEVE MOTIONS TO PASS AS AMENDED. PLEASE KALRA STONE. BY STONE AYE CUNNINGHAM CUNNINGHAM I. CHOW. CHOW I CHIU. CHIU I CONSULT FLETCHER. GONZALEZ FLETCHER AYE HOLDEN. HOLDEN I KALRA. KALRA AYE KILEY. MAIENSCHEIN. MAIENSCHEIN I REYES. REYES I. THAT BILLS OUT. AND WE WILL MOVE TO ITEM FIFTEEN A. B. THIRTY TO FORTY NINE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. THIS WILL BE QUICK AND EASY. ALWAYS IS THANK YOU THIS IS THE STAPLE HARPO. AND AS YOU SPEND. WATCHING THE LAST NUMBER OF YEARS THIS HAS BEEN A A CONTENTIOUS AND. ISSUE AND IN FACT LAST YEAR'S BARBELL WAS PROBABLY THE MOST SOME OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT REFORMS TO THE STATE BAR IN A LONG TIME. THIS BILL IS INTENDED TO CONTINUE THAT BUT ALSO TO. TO IT ENSURE THAT THAT WE ARE PROVIDING PUBLIC PROTECTION AND. FILLED FULFILLING OUR OBLIGATION OF OVERSIGHT OF THE STATE BAR AT THE SAME TIME TO THEIR NUMBER PROVISIONS THAT ENHANCE PUBLIC PROTECTION ESPECIALLY WHERE THERE THE STATE BAR CHORD IS DEALING WITH. WITH ATTORNEYS WHO HAVE HARMED THE PUBLIC. THEIR NUMBER PROVISIONS TO THOSE OF. YOU HAVE QUESTIONS WE CAN GO THROUGH THOSE. WE ALSO ARE ASKING IN THIS ONE FOR INDEPENDENT A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW. THE BAR WE KNOW AND HAD SOME. BATES AND EARLY INDICATIONS OF RAISING BAR DUES THAT SOMETHING BAD IS. CONTROVERSIAL IN THIS COMMITTEE AND CERTAINLY CONTROVERSIAL AMONG ATTORNEYS AND IF WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION. THEN WHAT. I FEEL WE NEED IS TO HAVE ENOUGH OF AN AUDIT THAT'S DONE TYPICALLY WHEN WE DO BUDGET ITEMS THE LEGISLATURE WE HAVE THE LA DOES THE BENEFIT OF THE ALLELES OPINION TO LOOK AT WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING WHAT THE. THE ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING AND HELP US UNDERSTAND WHAT THE REAL IMPACTS ARE. SO IF WE'RE GOING TO ENTERTAIN THE QUESTION NEXT YEAR OF RAISING THE BAR DUES WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE KNOW WHAT IT IS WHY IT IS HOW IT'S JUSTIFIED. AND FOR THAT WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND BETTER. THE FINANCIAL WORKINGS OF THE BAR TO THAT'S AN IMPORTANT PIECE THERE AND THEN WE CAN HAVE THE THE CONVERSATION. NEXT YEAR ABOUT THAT ANOTHER PROVISION THAT WAS ADDED IN AND THIS IS WHY MS RAISES HERE. IS THAT. WE AGREE THAT TO TAKE A DOLLAR FROM. THE. LAWYER ASSISTANCE PROGRAM AND MOVE THAT INTO AN ORGANIZATION THAT IS GOING TO RUN AND SUPPORT ATTORNEYS RECOVERING FROM SUBSTANCE AND ALCOHOL ABUSE THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT PROVISION. IF WE'RE GOING TO ADDRESS THAT DID SITUATION OF ATTORNEYS THAT DAY WHO ARE SUFFERING FROM ALCOHOL AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND REALLY GIVE THEM A PATH. DEAL WITH THAT THEIR OWN DEMONS DEAL WITH THE ISSUES THAT THEY HAVE RAISED AND ISRAEL'S PROPOSE THAT IN A SEPARATE BILL AND APPRECIATE THAT YOU BROUGHT THAT INTO THE BARBELL BECAUSE WE TRY TO HAVE EVERYTHING. DEALING WITH THE BAR IN ONE BILL THIS ALLOWS US TO DO THIS I THINK THIS IS A VERY WORTHY CAUSE FOR US TO BE ABLE TO DO IT'S A VERY APPROPRIATE. IN IN OUR BILL. THE OTHER ANOTHER ASPECT THAT WE'RE TRYING TO APPROACH THIS YEAR'S ENHANCING DIVERSITY. WE NEED TO LOOK AT DIVERSITY ACROSS THE LEGAL PROFESSION WE NEED TO LOOK AT. DIVERSITY AND JUDICIAL RANKS WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT PROFESSIONALS PROVIDING SERVICES TO CALIFORNIANS LOOK LIKE CALIFORNIANS INCOME FROM THE VARIETY OF BACKGROUNDS WE ALL COME FROM. AND THAT'S ANOTHER ISSUE IN THIS BILL THAT WE'RE BEING THAT WE'RE RATE BEING RAISED. AS WELL AS AND SEAL THE FOR PRO BONO PROVISIONS WORKING WITH MR GRAY WHO HAD BROUGHT A BILL FORD THAT AGREED AGAIN TO BRING THIS APPROPRIATELY INTO THE BARBELL. AND ASKING THE BAR TO LOOK AT HOW WE. HOW WE REALLY INCENTIVIZE AND PRO MAY INSURE THAT LAWYERS HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE PRO BONO WORK? ACCESS TO JUSTICE IS A VERY VERY CLEAR ISSUE ACROSS STATE. AND THE WORK THAT TOURNEY'S DO ON A PRO BONO BASIS OR CONTRIBUTING TO THOSE ORGANIZATIONS TO PROVIDE LEGAL SERVICES. IT'S CRITICAL FOR US SO THAT'S WHY THAT'S ANOTHER ANOTHER ISSUE THAT WE HAVE. IN THE BAR BILL THAT WE'RE TRYING TO SORT OUT THIS YEAR IT'S A COMPREHENSIVE BILL ALLOWS US TO HAVE A SINGLE CONVERSATION WITH THE BAR AND GO THROUGH A MYRIAD OF ISSUES. THESE CONVERSATIONS WILL CONTINUE AS AS FAR MOVES FOR OUR THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD AND I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTES. AND WOULD ASK MS ERUPTED FROM HIS REYES TO PRESENT AS WELL AND THEN MOVE ON TO US WITNESSES PLEASE. VERY GOOD. AMONG THE PROVISIONS ISN'T NOTED EARLIER IS A CHANGE IN THE LAWYERS ASSISTANCE PROGRAM THAT WOULD DIRECT ONE DOLLAR FROM EACH FEE COLLECTED. FOR THE PROGRAM TO THE OTHER BAR THE OTHER BARS APPEAR SUPPORT GROUP TO PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR ATTORNEYS. AS NOTED EARLIER RECOVERING FROM ALCOHOL AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE. DUE TO BUDGET CUTS THE OTHER BAR LOST MOST OF ITS FUNDING AND NOW SURVIVES ON PRIVATE CONTRIBUTIONS. THE OTHER BAR CONTINUES TO PROVIDE A WIDE RANGE OF FREE CONFIDENTIAL SERVICES TO CALIFORNIA LAWYERS RECOVERING FROM ALCOHOL AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE. REACHING AS MANY AS TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND LAWYERS AND LAW STUDENTS ANNUALLY. THE OF THE BAR HASN'T JUST SAVED CAREERS SAVED LIVES. AND WITH WITH US TO SPEAK ON THIS IS A JERRY BROWN FROM THE OTHER BAR. ELLEN THANK YOU VERY MUCH I AM GERRY BRON I'M AN ALCOHOLIC WITH TWENTY ONE AND A HALF YEARS OF SOBRIETY. SOON TO VITAL STATISTICS TO MAKE A POINT. I'M EIGHTY EIGHT YEARS OLD AND I'VE BEEN PRACTICING LAW FOR SIXTY FIVE YEARS. NEITHER OF THOSE THINGS WHATEVER OCCURRED HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE INTERVENTION AND MY WIFE OF THE OTHER BAR. WHICH IS A CALIFORNIA NONPROFIT WHOSE SOLE MISSION. IS. TO PROVIDE PEER SUPPORT FOR LAWYERS JUDGES LAW STUDENTS PARA PROFESSIONALS AND OTHERS IN THE LEGAL COMMUNITY. WE HAVE A VERY ELABORATE PROGRAM. DAVID MAMMALS WEEK TO THAT HE'S A OTHER BAR CONSULTANT AND A VERY GOOD ONE. WELL A GREAT DEAL AS WE DO THE STATE BAR. THANK YOU MICHAEL AND ASSEMBLYMAN REYES ASSEMBLY PERSON PRAISE FOR YOUR SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. A I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS BUT I KNOW TIME IS PRECIOUS. SO I WILL YIELD THAT DAVID AND WE WILL NOTE FOR THE RECORD THAT DAPPER NECKWEAR. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN OF AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS I DON'T. LIVES DAVID MATT I AM A CONSULTANT FOR THIS FOR THE OTHER BAR HAVE BEEN FOR TEN YEARS. AND THE. THE PIECE I WANT TO ADDRESS IS THAT. CO EXISTENCE OF THE LAPD WHICH HAS BEEN THE STATE BARS. EFFORT TO AND A GOOD ONE AT DEALING WITH THIS ISSUE THAT YOU MAY OR MAY NOT BE AWARE OF IT BUT IT'S BECOMING MORE. UNDENIABLY APPARENT THAT THE LEGAL PROFESSION HAS A BIGGER PROBLEM. WITH DRUG ALCOHOL ABUSE THAN ANY OTHER PROFESSION THERE'S. SOME RATHER. WELL. CIRCULATED STUDIES THAT HAVE COME OUT IN THE LAST YEAR HAVE ESTABLISHING THAT. I'VE COMPLETED THE LA P. PROGRAM WHICH IS A FIVE YEAR PROGRAM. I WORKED FOR THE LA P. PROGRAM FOR A YEAR AND NOW I'M INVOLVED WITH THE OTHER BAR. FREQUENTLY PEOPLE WANNA SET UP BUT A DICHOTOMY BETWEEN THE TWO IS SO ONE OR THE OTHER IS BETTER OR. THE ONLY ONE IS NECESSARY. AND THE IMPORTANT POINT I WANT TO MAKE IS THAT. WE SERVE OVERLAPPING BUT SUPPLEMENTAL AND COMPLEMENTARY FUNCTIONS BUT THERE ARE SOME VERY CRUCIAL DIFFERENCES. IF SOMEBODY'S GOING TO SEEK HELP FROM. THE LAPD THEY HAVE TO CALL. PERSON WHO IS AN EMPLOYEE OF THE STATE BAR. THEY HAVE TO GO DOWN SOMETIMES TO TEN EIGHTY HOWARD STREET FOR THEIR INTAKE INTERVIEW. AND THEY HAVE TO PAY QUITE OF BIT OF MONEY TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM. DESERVE SOME SIGNIFICANT BARRIERS. PEOPLE TO GET THAT HELP BECAUSE. ATTORNEYS ARE MORTIFIED TO HAVE TO SEEK HELP FOR THIS PROBLEM IN THE FIRST PLACE. BECAUSE THEY'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THEIR REPUTATIONS AND THIS IS A DISEASE THAT STILL HAS A HORRIBLE STIGMA. SO THE OTHER BARIS CONFIDENTIAL IT'S FREE IT'S VOLUNTARY AND IT PROVIDES A PLACE FOR ATTORNEYS TO GO. WHO WE REALLY ARE NOT WILLING OR YET ABLE TO GO ANYWHERE ELSE? AS ARE GOAL IT'S USUALLY OUR FUNCTION TO GET PEOPLE BEFORE. THEY NEED TO GO TO THE LAPD FRANKLY PEOPLE ARE THEY ALL APPEAR ALREADY BEING DISCIPLINE. THEY CAN CALL UP AN EIGHT HUNDRED NUMBER THAT WE HAVE BETTER WE'VE BEEN IN EXISTENCE FOR FORTY YEARS. AND THEY CAN TALK TO OUR CONSULTANT WHICH HAPPENS TO BE ME AND MY PHONE IS RINGING RIGHT NOW. BECAUSE WE WORK ON US. STREAMLINED BUDGET AND. WE WASTE NONE OF THE MONEY ON FRIVOLOUS THINGS. AND THEY CAN GET CONFIDENTIAL. ADVICE AND SUPPORT AND INFORMATION. BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY WITH THEY CAN GET IS LONG TERM MUTUAL SUPPORT GROUPS. AND IF YOU STUDY THE PROFESSION OF DRUG TREATMENT YOU'LL FIND IT. THERE ARE MANY DISPUTED FACTS THERE'S ONE THAT IS NOT DISPUTED. AND THAT IS THE BIGGEST. VARIABLE THAT CORRELATES WITH LONG TERM SUCCESSFUL OUTCOMES IS PARTICIPATION. IN LONG TERM ONGOING MUTUAL SUPPORT GROUPS AND FOR MOST CITIZENS THAT IS A A OR AN A. LAWYERS ARE NOTORIOUSLY UNWILLING AROUND. HAPPY ABOUT GOING TO AN A OR A. AND WE HAVE. FORTY MEETINGS EVERY WEEK IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WHERE THE LAWYERS CAN GO AND THEY'RE SURROUNDED BY? LAW STUDENTS LAWYERS AND JUDGES THEIR CONFIDENTIALITY IS RESPECTED AND THEY GET WHAT THEY NEED IF THEY'RE IN RECOVERY TO MAKE SURE THEY STAY IN RECOVERY. WE HELPED GET THEM THEIR IT WE HOPE KEEP THEM THERE FOR EVERY LAWYER WHO IS NOT DYSFUNCTIONAL BEHIND DRUGS AND ALCOHOL. THERE IS A BOOK OF BUSINESS AND CLIENTS WHO ARE LIKELY TO BECOME VICTIMIZED THAT THE PUBLIC WHO WERE HERE THANK YOU AT IT I WANT TO MAKE SURE WE ALSO TIME. FOR QUESTIONS AND HIS ODD WITH THEIR LAST SALE THE REST OF THAT I THINK IS SIGNIFICANT IS THAT. WE HAVE BEEN STRUGGLING TO STAY FINANCIALLY. SOLVE IT FOR YEARS AND IT. A DOLLAR IS NOT A LOT OF MONEY BUT WHEN YOU ADD UP. THE FEW DOLLARS WHAT YOU END UP WITH IS A GAME CHANGER FOR OUR ORGANIZATION. FINANCIALLY AND ONE OTHER THING THAT WE DO THAT THE LAPD IS NOT DO IS WE WELCOME LAW STUDENTS. AND YOU CANNOT PARTICIPATE IN LAPD UNTIL YOU HAVE PAID. YOUR FEET TO TAKE THE BAR EXAM. WE HAVE A LOT OF LAW STUDENTS AND FOR EVERYONE OF THOSE PEOPLE WERE ABLE TO. HELP WE WE HAD OFTEN A PROBLEM LATER ON THANK YOU SIR. ANY OTHER WITNESSES BRIEFLY PLEASE GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS MICHAEL CALLING TO KNOW I'M THE CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF THE STATE BAR. I WANT TO THANK START BY THANKING MISTER STONE AND THE COMMITTEE AND ITS STAFF FOR YOUR PERSISTENT LEADERSHIP IN SEEKING REFORM OF THE BAR. MY OWN SERVICE ON THE BAR OVER THE SICK LAST SIX YEARS REFLECTS THAT OF PERSISTENCE I WAS APPOINTED BY ONE SPEAKER REAPPOINTED WHICH WAS NOT PREVIOUSLY POSSIBLE BY ANOTHER SPEAKER. I WAS ELECTED THE LAST PRESIDENT TO THE BAR BY MY PEERS AND I WAS CHOSEN THE FIRST CHAIR OF THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES BY THE US THE US SUPREME COURT. WE HAVE HAD A SUCCESSFUL YEAR OF IMPLEMENTING THEM GROUNDBREAKING PERFORMANCE THAT THIS COMMITTEE. WAS THE ARCHITECT OF LAST YEAR. WE HAVE SUCCESSFULLY SEPARATED THE CALIFORNIA LAWYERS ASSOCIATION AND WISH THEM WELL IN THEIR PRIVATE TRADE ASSOCIATION FUNCTION. WE HAVE RENEWED OUR FOCUS ON PUBLIC PROTECTION. WE ARE ESTABLISHING A MEANINGFUL EFFORT TO PRIORITIZE OUR CASES SO WE CAN PUT OUR RESOURCES WHERE THEY DO THE BEST FOR CALIFORNIANS. WE ARE ENGAGING IN MEANINGFUL OUTREACH TO CONSUMERS OF LEGAL SERVICES TO MAKE SURE THEY KNOW ABOUT THE SERVICES THAT WE CAN OFFER THEM. WE ARE FOCUSED ON THE VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA SUCH AS THOSE AFFECTED BY THE UNAUTHORIZED PRACTICE OF LAW IN IMMIGRATION AND OTHER SETTINGS WE ARE WE REACHING OUT TO CALIFORNIANS IN THE LANGUAGES THAT THEY SPEAK. WE ARE COOPERATING WITH OUR PARTNERS IN LAW ENFORCEMENT TO ADDRESS UNAUTHORIZED PRACTICE OF LAW. WE HAVE BUILT AND RENEWED A RELATIONSHIP WITH THE SEIU THAT REPRESENTS OUR EMPLOYEES. AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUED COOPERATION WITH THEM TO BUILD A BETTER BAR. I WILL SAY THAT WHEN STRONG MANAGEMENT WHICH I FIRMLY BELIEVE WE HAVE. FOLLOWS WEAK MANAGEMENT. ALL THE NEWS IS BAD AT FIRST VAN COVER ALL THE PROBLEMS THAT HAVE DEVELOPED IN YEARS OF NEGLECT THE LEADERSHIP AND THEY BEGIN TO ADDRESS THEM. AND SO I CAN'T TELL YOU THE WORK IS DONE IT IS FAR FROM DONE. I CAN TELL YOU THAT WE'RE COMMITTED TO THE WORK AND THAT WE WILL IDENTIFY PROBLEMS BE HONEST ABOUT THEM AND FIX THEM AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUED PARTNERSHIP WITH YOU AND YOUR STAFF IN THAT REFORM EFFORT.

ECHO THE WORDS OF THE PRESIDENT BY THANKING EVERYONE FOR YOUR PERSISTENCE OPTICALLY ARE CHAIR WHY KNOWS BEEN. TRY HEARD CATS ON THIS COMMITTEE. LEADERSHIP OF THE BAR FOR WHERE WE'VE COME. WE'VE HAD SOME DIFFICULT CONVERSATIONS LAST COUPLE YEARS AND I DO THINK WE ARE. ON A BETTER TRACK. I WLL SAY I KNOW THAT THERE'S BEEN A REPEATED REQUEST FOR FEE INCREASE AND AND I THINK ALONG WITH MOST MY COLLEAGUES. ARE NOT PREPARED TO DO THAT AT THIS TIME UP FOR VARIETY REASONS OF FOR MY COLLEAGUES WHO ARE NOT HERE. BEYOND LAST YEAR WE'VE HAD SIGNIFICANT CONVERSATIONS ABOUT A LOT OF ISSUES HAVING TO DO A STATE PARK FINANCES AND AND FRANKLY A SIGNIFICANT CONCERN THAT. WE STILL DON'T HAVE THE HANDLE ON OUR EXPENSES. AS WE WOULD WANT. ISSUES AROUND EXECUTIVE PAY ROUND TRAVEL EXPENSES AROUND. BUSINESS EXPENSES INVOLVING% SLUSH FUNDS AND SIGNIFICANT ALCOHOL CONSUMPTIONAT THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN PARITY THE PAPERS. QUESTION A REAL STATE DECISIONS OF ONE OF THE THINGS I'D HOPED WAS GONNA BE PART OF THIS BILL WAS. REAL TRUE ZERO BASED BUDGETING ARE THIS IS. THE BUDGET PROCESS THAT APPLIES TO OTHER STATE AGENCIES AND THE COURTS ARMED AND. GIVEN OUR OVERSIGHT MY HOPE WAS THAT WE WERE GOING TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THAT AND I THOUGHT THAT WAS APPROPRIATE. OF I KNOW THAT THE BAR HAD CONCERNS WITH ZERO BASED BUDGETING AND AND I I REALIZED WE HAD A MEETING LAST WEEK I DID HAVE A CHANCE TO ASK YOU ABOUT THAT. COULD YOU GIVE US A PERSPECTIVE ON WHY THAT WOULD BE CHALLENGING. FOR YOU AT THIS TIME. FIRST CRACK IN AND OUT OF THE FOR LEO TO SEE ACTUALLY HAS TO MAKE THE TRAINS RUN ON TIME. WE HAVE AT YOUR ENCOURAGEMENT. DOWN TWELVE STUDIES OF THE BAR AND ITS MANAGEMENT AND OPERATION OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS THAT WE SPENT ARMS A COUPLE MILLION DOLLARS AND THOUSANDS OF STAFF HOURS DOING THAT. WE ARE TRANSPORT WE UNDERSTAND THE NEED TO BE TRANSPARENT ABOUT HOW WE MANAGE PUBLIC RESOURCES WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE A CASE TO MAKE TO YOU BEFORE WE ASK FOR A FEE BILL NEXT YEAR. WE ARE COMMITTED TO TRANSPARENCY AND THAT THOSE FURTHER STUDIES THAT YOU THINK ARE NEEDED BUT WE DON'T WANT TO DUPLICATE EFFORT BECAUSE THE TAXPAYERS ARE PAYING FOR THIS. WE WANT IT TO BE ACHIEVABLE IN THE TIME YOU SET FOR US WHICH IS BEFORE THE FEMALES ARE NEXT YEAR AND WE WANT IT TO BE MEANINGFUL. WE'VE SEEN THE LANGUAGE THAT STAFF IS PREPARED WE'VE HAD A CONSTRUCTIVE DIALOGUE ABOUT THAT LANGUAGE AND WE INTEND TO CONTINUE THAT DIALOGUE WE KNOW WHAT YOU WANT AND WE WILL PROVIDE IT TO YOU. SO DEFTLY APPRECIATE THAT THAT ANSWER ALTHOUGH I HAVE WONDERED IF ZERO BASED BUDGETING AND WOOD. REALLY CUT TO THE CORE OF WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR IN A VERY HEALTHY AVOID THE NEED FOR FUTURE AUDITS BUT. I I AM I AM. A. IT WHILE I WOULD PREFER ZERO BASED BUDGETING. YOU KNOW I I I THINK I'M WILLING TO SUPPORT MOVING THIS BILL FORWARD. BUT UNDERSTANDING FOR ME THAT THE AUDIT IN THE STUDY THAT'S BEEN CALLED FOR IN THIS BAR BILL. REALLY REPRESENTS I THINK AGAIN THE BARE MINIMUM OF WHAT WE WOULD NEED FOR RESPONSIBLE AUDIT APART SPENCE'S SO I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO. SEE WHAT WE GET AND. AND MOVING FORWARD FROM THERE. ARM ON A SEPARATE TOPIC IN THIS IS ONE THAT I'VE DISCUSSED I THINK WITH ALL THE PARTIES INVOLVED. OF THE TOPIC OF DIVERSITY AND JUST A LITTLE BIT OF CONTEXT AS WAS NOTED IN THE STAFF ANALYSIS AT THIS MOMENT. IN OUR CALIFORNIA STATE BAR EIGHTY PERCENT OF THE ATTORNEYS ARE WHITE. ARE AT A TIME WHEN. Y. CALIFORNIANS MAKE UP THIRTY EIGHT PERCENT OF OUR POPULATION AND WHAT I WOULD SAY IS FOR FOR NON WHITE ATTORNEYS. THE VAST MAJORITY OF THEM DO NOT REALLY ENGAGE WITH THE STATE PARK. AND I KNOW THIS. BECAUSE THE VAST MAJORITY OF ATTORNEYS OF COLOUR. INTERACT TYPICALLY WITH WITH ETHNIC PARSIS YOU ASIANS OR WOMEN'S BAR ASSOCIATIONS ARE LGBT BAR ASSOCIATIONS. AND AS SOMEONE WHO USED TO BE THE PRESIDENT OF ONE OF THE LARGEST ETHNIC BAR ASSOCIATIONS IN THE STATE. THAT IS IN PART BECAUSE OF A PERCEPTION AND I THINK A REALITY THAT THE STATE BAR HAS NOT FOCUSED ON ISSUES OF DIVERSITY AND ADVANCEMENT. AND ACCESS TO JUSTICE IN IN A WAY THAT WE WOULD WE WOULD HOPE. THERE AS YOU KNOW BEEN SOME CONCERNS RAISED ABOUT A ABOUT DECENTRALIZING THE FOCUS OF DIVERSITY. WITHIN THE BAR IT USED TO BE THAT THERE WAS A A UNIT WITHIN THE BAR THAT REALLY FOCUSED ON THIS AND. NOW THE PROPOSAL IS TO ESSENTIALLY DISBAND THAT AND TO. WITH THE EYE OF OF HOPEFULLY IMBUING IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE BAR ARE A COMMITMENT TO DIVERSITY BUT AT THIS MOMENT THAT IS NOT YET. IN PLACE AND SO. I JUST WANNA SAY THAT THIS IS AN AREA THAT I'M GONNA BE VERY FOCUSED ON THIS COMING YEAR. I APPRECIATE IN THIS BAR BILL. THERE WILL BE AN ANALYSIS OF OF OF HOW DIVERSITY IS IS ADDRESSED AND WHAT AS. A STATE BAR WE COULD DO TO FOCUS ON UP PROMOTING. THE ISSUES THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO ALL ON BUT IT'S A IT'S ONE THAT I AM VERY CONCERNED ABOUT AND AND FRANKLY HAD THOUGHT ABOUT NOT SUPPORTING THIS BILL FOR THAT FOR THAT REASON. ARM I THINK SOME OF THE OTHER ISSUES IN THE ANALYSIS ABOUT. THE CALIFORNIA BARS STANDARDS AND THE IMPACT OF A PASSING SCORE LEVELS ON DIVERSITY WITHIN THE FUTURE OF THE BAR. WERE VERY TROUBLING AND. I'D LOVE ANY PERSPECTIVES ON THAT BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY. SPELL I AM WILLING TO SUPPORT THIS. BILL. BUT WITH AN EYE TO THE FUTURE AND AND CERTAINLY NEXT YEAR WHEN WE GET ALL THIS INFORMATION BACK CERTAINLY THERE'S A PUSH FOR FEE INCREASE. THESE ARE ISSUES THAT I'LL BE SCRUTINIZING SO IF YOU HAVE ANY INITIAL COMMENTS ON THAT LOVE TO HEAR THEM BUT I I YOU KNOW I KNOW I'VE HEARD FROM BAR LEADERSHIP THERE IS A COMMITMENT AND I BELIEVE THAT. TO BE TRUE BUT. AT THE END OF THE DAY WE NEED TO WE NEED TO SEE SOME GOOD RESULTS. THANK YOU THE LEGISLATURE HAS GIVEN US THREE CHARGES WE ARE TO REGULATE THE PROFESSION FOR THE PROTECTION OF CALIFORNIANS. WE ARE TO PROMOTE DIVERSITY IN THE PROFESSION AND THE JUSTICE SYSTEM AND WE ARE TO PROMOTE ACCESS TO JUSTICE BY CALIFORNIANS OF ALL MEANS WE TAKE THOSE THREE MISSION SERIOUSLY. I AM PERSONALLY COMMITTED TO THE DIVERSITY AGENDA AS THE FIRST OPENLY GAY PRESIDENT OF THE STATE BAR AND THE LAST AS IT HAPPENS. I WOULD JUST LIKE TO MENTION THREE INITIATIVES THAT WE'VE RECENTLY UNDERTAKEN TO REFLECT OUR COMMITMENT OF THIS AGENDA. ONE AS WE'VE REVISED OUR LEGAL RELATIONSHIP WITH THE CALIFORNIA BAR FOUNDATION SO THEY MAY DO THEIR GOOD WORK UNFETTERED BY PROP TO A NINE. SECONDLY WE HAVE INITIATED A PROJECT THIS YEAR THAT PROVIDE PSYCHOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS FOR THOSE WHO WERE PREPARING TO TAKE THE BAR EXAM. IT IS OPEN TO ALL COMERS WITHOUT RESPECT TO THEIR RACE GENDER CREED CLASS ETCETERA BUT THE PSYCHOLOGICAL WORK THAT'S DONE SUGGESTS THAT PEOPLE OF COLOR AND WOMEN ON THE OTHERS FROM DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES ARE MORE LIKELY TO PARTICIPATE AND MORE LIKELY TO BENEFIT. WILL SEEK WE'RE GONNA MEASURE THE RESULTS OF THAT PROGRAM IF IT DOES WELL WE WANT TO SEND IT OUT INTO THE WORLD TO HELP IT'S REPLICATED THE DOESN'T DO WELL WE'LL TRY SOMETHING ELSE. AND THEN LASTLY WE ARE UNDERTAKING A CENSUS OF ALL OF THE APPOINTMENTS THAT WE'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR TO DETERMINE WHERE WE ARE IN TERMS OF DIVERSITY AT THIS MOMENT SO THAT WE KNOW WHAT OUR BASE WERE BUILDING FROM AS. SO WE WE GET IT WE'RE COMMITTED TO IT THAT WE CAN DO BETTER AND WE INTEND TO DO BETTER AND WE WELCOME THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE COLLABORATE WITH YOU ON THAT ISSUE SOMEONE I HAVE YOU DONE A SURVEY OF YOUR MEMBERSHIP ON THESE ISSUES. IT'S JUST SOMETHING THAT JUST OCCURRED TO MY BECAUSE I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER TAKEN ONE BUT AGAIN I'VE SPOKEN TOO LITERALLY AND I'M NOT EXAGGERATING. HUNDREDS UPON HUNDREDS OF ATTORNEYS OF COLOUR WHO JUST DON'T PARTICIPATE IN STATE BAR. ACTIVITIES AND DATA JUST CURIOUS WHETHER THAT'S HAPPENED WHEN YOU SAY A SURVEY OF OUR MEMBERS ON THESE ISSUES WOULD BE REFERRING TO EXACTLY WELL I EXCUSE YOU HAVE A SENSE OF WHETHER YOUR MEMBERSHIP THINKS THE BAR IS DOING A GOOD JOB AS FAR AS DIVERSITY. ADVANCING THE ISSUES IMPORTANT TO ATTORNEYS OF DIVERSE BACKGROUNDS. EXCEPT FOR NO I DON'T HAVE A SENSE OF WHETHER WHAT OUR MEMBERS THINK OTHER THAN AN ANECDOTAL FUNDS THAT COMPORTS WITH YOURS BOB. OKAY GREAT AND AND AGAIN YOU KNOW I DO I DO. VALUE I THINK THE COULD THE COMMITMENT OF CURRENT LEADERSHIP TO THIS SIDE I JUST I HOPE WE'LL GET TO. SOME REAL RESULTS. AND THAT THIS WILL NOT BE A CONVERSATION THAT WE FORGET ABOUT IN HERE. THANK YOU. JERRY MIKLOS. THANK YOU SO ON THE DIVERSITY ISSUE WHEN THINGS I AM GONNA PROPOSE FOR THIS COMMITTEE. IS THAT WE HOLD A HEARING ON DIVERSITY IN THE JUDICIAL BRANCH THAT WE HAVE A BETTER HANDLE AROUND THAT. AND AND IT'S A VERY SERIOUS ISSUE THIS COMMITTEE OR BY ITSELF I WILL SPEAK FOR ME BUT A LOT OF YOU HAVE BACK THIS IT. HAVE RAISED QUESTIONS ABOUT THE CUT SCORE IN THE BAR. THE PURPOSE OF THE. OF THE BAR THE BAR EXAM IS TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE THE HIGHEST QUALITY OF ATTORNEYS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. BUT I'VE NOT BEEN CONVINCED THAT THE CUTS CORPS THAT WE USE. IS IS WHAT IS IS REALLY GETTING THAT AN APPROPRIATE WAY AND THE AFFECTED IT TENDS TO HAVE. IS TO MAKE IT HARDER FOR. LAWYERS OF COLOR TO COME INTO THAT THE LAW PRACTICE AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO TAKE VERY VERY SERIOUSLY SO IT'S NOT ONLY LOOKING AT. THAT THE SERVICES THE BAR THAT THE PERSPECTIVE OF LAWYERS TO THE BAR BUT IT IS HOW WE ENSURE THAT THE BAR. ULTIMATELY LOOKS LIKE CALIFORNIA OVER THE YEARS AND LOOKING AT THE BARRIERS TO ENTRY INTO THE LEGAL PROFESSION IS ONE OF THOSE SIGNIFICANT ONES THERE ARE ALSO OTHER WAYS WE CAN ADDRESS. THAT QUALITY ISSUE AND THAT'S ONE OF THE FUNCTIONS THE BARS TO ENSURE PUBLIC PROTECTION. HAVING A HIGH QUALITY HIGH STANDARD FOR LAWYERS IN CALIFORNIA IS THAT THE CUTS SCORE DOESN'T NECESSARILY I IN MY VIEW I DON'T THINK IT IT. MEANS THAT WE HAVE HIGHER QUALITY OF ATTORNEYS THERE ARE OTHER THINGS THAT WE CAN AND SHOULD BE LOOKING AT THAT. AND SO IF WE HAVE HIGH BARRIERS TO ENTRY. WE'RE NOT GOING TO SEE THE DIVERSITY IN THE LEGAL PROFESSION IF WE ALLOW. APPROPRIATE DIVERSITY LEGAL PROFESSION BUT KEEP THE PROFESSION STRONG THAT SOMETHING THAT THAT WE DEFINITELY NEED TO BE LOOKING AT. AND AS TO THE AUDIT. THE WEATHER ZERO BASED BUDGETING WE'VE HAD THESE CONVERSATIONS RIGHT NOW. I DON'T GET TIED UP IN A PARTICULAR TYPE OF AUDIT BUT IT DOES NEED TO BE COMPREHENSIVE. THERE ARE A LOT OF STUDIES THAT WERE DONE AND THAT'S A FAIR POINT. WE DO NOT WANT THE BAR TO REPLICATE THE STUDIES WE WANT TO USE THE STUDIES WHERE WHERE APPROPRIATE IN THAT INFORMATION WE ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO DO THAT. BUT WE ALSO NEED THE BUT THE STUDIES ARE. SNAPSHOTS OF CERTAIN CERTAIN TYPES OF INFORMATION WITHIN THE BAR UNIVERSE WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE ENOUGH OF A COMPREHENSIVE UNDERSTANDING OF THE NEED. AS DEMONSTRATED WHERE THE BAR IS GOING TO NEED TO GO FOR I THINK FOR THIS COMMITTEE TO BE ABLE TO WEIGH IN. POSITIVELY ON A A FEE INCREASE THAT HAS TO BE JUSTIFIED AND TO DO THAT WE NEED TO KNOW ABOUT FULLY UNDERSTAND. WHAT THE BARS EXPENSES ARE WHAT THE STRUCTURE IS AND WHETHER OR NOT? A FEE INCREASE IS NECESSARY OR EVEN HOW MUCH THAT'S WHAT THE REQUEST IS WE ARE WORKING WITH THE BAR. ON THE SCOPE WHO'S GOING TO DO IT THERE'S DISAGREEMENT ABOUT THAT. BUT IN THE END. IF WE DON'T GET THE RIGHT INFORMATION I THINK THIS COMMITTEE IS GOING TO STRUGGLE WITH A FEE INCREASE REQUEST IF WE GET THE RIGHT INFORMATION WE CAN HAVE THE ROBUST CONVERSATION THAT WE NEED THAT IS BACKED BY. FINANCIAL DATA THAT REALLY ESTABLISHES THE NEED SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO SET UP IN THIS PART TO SPELL IS GET US THAT INFORMATION IF THAT REQUEST IS GOING TO COME NEXT YEAR. THEN WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO ACT ON IT IN A RATIONAL AND INFORMED WAY SO THOSE ARE ISSUES THERE ARE A NUMBER OF OTHER THINGS IN HERE. AND I REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT FOR THIS MOVING IT FORWARD. AS HAS BEEN IN THE PAST I FULLY INTEND TO KEEP EVERY BAMBER THIS COMMITTEE INFORMED ABOUT WHERE WE'RE GOING TO GO I WELCOME YOUR INPUT ON THE PROCESS OF THINGS THAT WE DO IS WE TRY TO NEGOTIATE. WITH THE STATE BAR WITH THE SENATE THE CHIEF JUSTICE ALL THOSE PARTIES WHO ARE INTERESTED IN THIS BUT AT THIS POINT I'M HOPING WE CAN MOVE THIS FORWARD. HEADED TOWARD THE FLOOR AS WE CONTINUE TO HAVE THESE CONVERSATIONS AND WILL CERTAINLY KEEP YOU INFORMED ABOUT WHERE WE STAND ON ALL OF THESE VERY IMPORTANT ISSUES AND I ASKED HER ABOUT.
