TO SUPPORT YOU THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE AND THEN WE'LL GO RIGHT INTO COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS. OF YOU. THANK YOU CENTER ATKINS AND AND OUR OUR VICE CHAIR -- SENATOR BATES IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE HERE WITH YOU -- I ALSO WANT -- TO GIVE A SPECIAL THANKS -- TO TO MY WIFE ASSEMBLY MEMBER GONZALEZ DODD WHO IS WHO IS HERE AS WELL FOR FOR A CONFIRMATION HEARING -- I APPRECIATE THE TIME OF HE SENATE I REALLY VIEW -- THE CONFIRMATION PROCESS -- IS THE BEGINNING OF AN ENGAGEMENT ON ISSUES RELATED. TO YOUR RESOURCES BOARD AND NOT THE END -- I THINK THAT THE ONGOING ENGAGEMENT AND DIALOGUE IS VERY IMPORTANT -- AND IF SUCCESSFUL IN THE CONFIRMATION PROCESS AND VERY COMMITTED. ON THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT IS IS PERSONALLY IMPORTANT TO ME AND MY SUPERVISORIAL DISTRICT IN SAN DIEGO. A CHILD BORN IN ONE PART OF MY DISTRICT IN A CHILD BORN IN THE OTHER PART OF MY DISTRICT THERE'S A TEN YEAR DISPARITY IN LIFE EXPECTANCY. TODAY IN SAN DIEGO IN CALIFORNIA AND ONE SUPERVISORIAL DISTRICT. A CHILD BORN IN IN IN ONE PART IS EIGHT TIMES MORE LIKELY TO HAVE ASTHMA THAN A CHILD BORN IN THE OTHER PART. I BELIEVE THAT SOME MORE. I DON'T THINK THAT THAT'S CONSISTENT WITH OUR VALUES AND BELIEFS. AND SO OUR COMMITMENT TO HAVING CLEAN AIR OUR COMMITMENT TO LOWER IN OUR GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS TO TACKLE THE USES OF CLIMATE CHANGE. ARE VITALLY IMPORTANT AND THE AUTHORITY THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS GIVEN THE CARB -- HAS TO BE PROPERLY EXECUTED IMPLEMENTED WITH THE PROPER ENGAGEMENT AND THE MOST IMPORTANT COUNT ABILITIES. ARE SO THAT WE CAN MEET OUR OUR OUR CO GOALS OF LOWERING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND IMPROVE AIR QUALITY AND SO I'M VERY COMMUNITIES ISSUES AS I'VE ONLY BEEN TO A HANDFUL OF MEETINGS HAS BEEN APPOINTED -- BUT AM I AM AND WORKING HARD TO GET UP TO SPEED AND I APPRECIATE THE SENATE'S CONSIDERATION OF MY APPOINTMENT. THANK YOU SUPERVISOR FLETCHER -- LET ME START WITH US SENATOR ROSS. THANK YOU MANAGER CONGRATULATIONS SUPERVISOR THANK YOU GENERAL THIS MAY BE A A LITTLE. SOON TO BE ASKING YOU THIS QUESTION. THE CHIU JUST ESSENTIALLY STARTED WITH A FEW MEETINGS UNDER YOUR BELT BUT ONE OF MY CONCERNS IS WHETHER WE TO A VERY GOOD JOB OF SETTING GOALS AND OBJECTIVES AND METRICS AND MEASURING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF PROGRAMS AND IN PARTICULAR -- AT THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD SEE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION PROGRAMS. OF THE WE HAVE IN PLACE SO I GUESS MY QUESTION IS HOW SHOULD WE BE MEASURING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION PROGRAMS. IN A TWO PARTER SHOULD THERE BE A PERIODIC RE EVALUATION OF PROGRAMS. GENERAL I WOULD SAY THE ONE OF THE FEW MEETINGS I'VE HAD THE PLEASURE OF ATTENDING WE RECEIVE THE S. B. ONE FIFTY REPORT -- WHICH IS A LEGISLATIVELY REQUIRED REPORT FOR CARD TO ASSESS -- ITS TRAJECTORY IN SUCCESS IN IN MEETING THE SB THIRTY TWO GOALS FOR A 40% REDUCTION BELOW NINETEEN NINETY LEVELS. BY TWENTY THIRTY AND REALITIES WERE NOT ON TRACK TO MEET OUR GOALS -- WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE WELL I'M SORRY WE ARE NOT ON TRACK -- TO MEET OUR GOALS AND IN FACT ON THE SITUATION IS GTTING WORSE. INSTEAD OF BETTER AND THAT'S THAT'S PRIMARILY IN LARGE PART DUE. TO THE EVER INCREASING NUMBER OF VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- BUT I DO THINK IN THE LA -- HOW TO ADD A PRETTY EXHAUSTIVE REPORT ON THIS AND AND DECEMBER -- THAT WE HAVE TO DO A BETTER JOB TO ENSURE. THAT THE PROGRAMS THAT HAVE BEEN PUT IN PLACE ARE EFFECTIVE. ARE COST EFFECTIVE ARE ACTUALLY ACHIEVING MEASURABLE GOALS AND IF THEY'RE NOT THEN WE NEED TO COME BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE AND SAY THIS PROGRAM WAS PUT IN PLACE WE DON'T THINK THAT IT'S WORKING. HI THIS IS WHERE WE THINK THAT THERE ARE THERE'S THERE'S POTENTIAL FOR CHANGE AND SO. I THINK THAT THE THE NATURE OF A OF A PROGRAM BY ITSELF HAS NO PURPOSE IT'S ONLY IN ITS EFFECTIVENESS -- TO LOWER GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS LOWER AIR POLLUTION AND SO. I THINK EVERY PROGRAM MUST BE CONSTANTLY MONITORED AND% EVALUATED -- AND IF THERE'S ONE THAT'S WORKING EXPERT JUST FOR THE PROGRAM'S WORKING DOESN'T MEAN THAT'S THE BEST ALLOCATION RESOURCES THERE COULD BE ANOTHER ONE THAT'S WORKING BETTER WE SHOULD DO MORE OF THAT -- ONE BUT I THINK IN TERMS OF MEDIAN THAT THE LEGISLATIVELY MANDATED GOALS WE'RE GONNA. HAVE TO BE INCREDIBLY EFFICIENT AND INCREDIBLY ACCOUNTABLE -- TO ACHIEVE THE ENDS THAT THAT WE SICK. WELL I HAPPEN TO AGREE WITH YOU AND THE LA -- SO I LOOK FORWARD TO WATCHING YOU. WORK AND PERFORM ONE SURE -- YOU ARE CONFIRMED AND I LOOK FORWARD TO MOVING YOUR CONFIRMATION AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME THANK YOU MANAGER. THANK YOU SENATOR ROTH MISTER VICE CHAIRMAN. THANK YOU ARE MADAM CHAIR WELL UNFORTUNATELY WE DON'T GET A CHANCE TO TEND TO HAVE A CONVERSATION -- AS SOMEBODY WHO BELIEVES IN CLIMATE CHANGE I THINK THEY'RE WORTHY GOALS ONE OF MY FRUSTRATIONS AND I'M INTEREST IN YOUR PERSPECTIVE SO YOU'VE BEEN IN THE LEGISLATURE NOW YOU CAN HAVE THIS ROLE. IS -- HOW COLLABORATIVE WE ALL BE BETWEEN THAT THE AGENCY AND IN THE LEGISLATURE BECAUSE WE'VE SEATED A LOT OF POWER AND AUTHORITY? TO THE BOARD AND SO I'M JUST I'M JUST CURIOUS. ARE YOU SEE THOSE DYNAMICS WORKING WELL HAVING HAVING SAT IN A LEGISLATIVE BODY NOT IN THE SENATE -- IN IN THE LOWER HOUSE -- IN IN THE ASSEMBLY THANKS FOR SAYING NO. I KNOW WHICH HOUSE AMEND -- YOU GET SHOT YOUR DIGITAL YOU GET ALL THIS IS. THE I WOULD JUST SAY HE'S GOING TO GET IN TROUBLE COLLEAGUES BE CAREFUL THE I DON'T I DON'T HAVE. BUT THE HAVING HAVING SAT THERE I MEAN LEGISLATIVE BODIES BY THEIR VERY NATURE VERY RESPONSIVE TO THE PUBLIC -- BECAUSE THAT IS THAT IS ESSENTIALLY YOUR EXISTENCE. AND WHEN LEGISLATIVE BODIES SET A GOAL AND GREATER REGULATORY ENTITY TO ACHIEVE THAT GOAL THAT REGULATORY ENTITY BY ITS NATURE IS NOT BECAUSE THAT'S NOT IT DERIVES ITS POWER FROM FROM THE LEGISLATURE. AND AND I THINK IT'S VITALLY IMPORTANT THAT REGULATORY ENTITIES. REALLY UNDERSTAND DEEPLY THAT THAT THEY THEY HAVE NO POWER OTHER THAN THAT GRANTED TO THEM BY THE LEGISLATURE -- AND SO THAT THE CONSTANT IN GAUGE MEN AND INTERACTION WITH THE LEGISLATURE TO RESPOND TO QUESTIONS TO RESPOND INCREASE TO RESPOND TO SUGGESTIONS -- I THINK IS A VITAL PART AND I THINK I THINK INCREASING THAT THAT BOND IN THAT RELATIONSHIP. OCT CAN CAN A SERVE TO TO ENSURE THE TRUST OF THE THE ENTITY THAT CREATED IT. BUT ALSO TO TO GENERAL'S POINT. CAN CONSERVE TO TO TO BUILD SOME TRUST SO THAT IF IF IF THERE BE WERE TO COME BACK AND SAY THIS PROGRAM WAS CREATED WITH THE BEST OF INTENTIONS BUT PERHAPS IT SHOULD CHANGE. THEN WE HAVE THAT COULD WELL IN THAT TRUST GO FORWARD -- AND I ALSO THINK I ALSO THINK AND THIS IS SOMETHING. I THINK FOR A LOT OF AGENCIES KIND OF FOREIGN -- BUT THE AB SIX SEVENTEEN PROGRAM I BELIEVE IS A VERY GOOD PROGRAM. I THINK THAT WAS GOOD LEGISLATION I THINK THAT IT IS DRIVING IN THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD TO WORK MORE CLOSELY WITH THE AIR DISTRICTS -- IN IN THE IN THE AB SIX SEVENTEEN COMMUNITIES AND TO REALLY WORK CLOSELY WITH THE COMMUNITY -- AND TO HEAR ABOUT CONCERNS IN A PRIORITIZE FUNDING. FOR PROGRAMS IN COMMUNITIES MOST MPACTED AND SO I THINK THAT THAT'S A A MINDSET SHIFT THAT IS A POSITIVE. ONE A MAN IF A MEMBER OF THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD I WILL BE RESPONSIVE PERSON HAVING. SAT IN THAT SEAT IN ENSURING THAT THE PERSPECTIVE THAT YOU HAVE GREAT THANK YOU. ABOUT. SO ONE OF THE QUESTION I HAVE I'M INTERESTED TO KNOW WHERE YOU KIND OF THINK THE SWEET SPOT IS SO I'M I'VE GOT WORKING CLASS DISTRICT. AND I HAVE A TINY COMMUTERS AND THEY DON'T WANT TO COMMUTE UT THEIR FORCES COMMITTEES I GOTTA FIFTY THOUSAND COME OUT CENTER CREE BALLY HUNDRED TEN THOUSAND DAY COMING OUT OF ANIL FAMILY ABOUT EIGHTY TWO THOUSAND COME OUT THE VICTOR VALLEY. SO WHAT'S WHAT'S THE BOUNCE BETWEEN. ECONOMIC YOU KNOW REGULATIONS AND AND ECONOMIC ITALITY WHERE TO HOW DO YOU HOW DO YOU HOW DO YOU BALANCE THAT WATER I DON'T THINK THE TWO ARE MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE YOU KNOW WE WE CREATED MORE JOBS. IN THE SOLAR INDUSTRY -- YOU KNOW LAST YEAR THAN THAN AN OTHER STATE IN THE COUNTRY -- AND SO I DON'T I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE TO THEIR THEIR IS INHERENTLY AT TIMES THE ROB -- BETWEEN THE TWO BUT I THINK I THINK PARTICULARLY WHEN IT COMES TO TRANSPORTATION -- WHEN YOU REALLY ANALYZE THE CONCEPT OF OF INDUCED DEMAND AND YOU LOOK AT EXAMPLES OF OF HOW DO YOU ACTUALLY LOWER CONGESTION -- WHICH HAS THE BENEFIT OF HELPING FOLKS. WHO ARE WANT TO SPEND MORE TIME WITH THEIR FAMILIES AND HAS THE BENEFIT OF OF LOWER IN OUR GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS ARE CARBON EMISSIONS? OUR AIR QUALITY STANDARDS I'M REALLY TRYING TO REALIGN SOME OF THAT THINKING -- BEHIND A GREATER INVESTMENT IN TRANSIT AND I I THINK THAT THAT'S VITAL I DON'T BELIEVE WE CAN WE CAN BUILD FREEWAYS TO TO GET HERSELF OUT OF THIS PROBLEM. A AND I THINK THAT WE HAVE TO A REAL LINE AND IN ONE OF THE MOST TROUBLING ASPECTS OF A RECENT REPORT. WAS IN LAST TEN YEARS WE REALLY HAVEN'T SIGNIFICANTLY ALTER THE STRUCTURE OF OUR TRANSPORTATION FUNDING -- AND SO WE WONDER WHY THE EMPTIES AND CONGESTION KEEP GOING UP AND SO I THIK THAT'S NOW THAT THAT'S NOT INHERENTLY A ROLL OF CARB -- BUT WE ARE DEPENDENT UPON OUR NPOS OUGHT TO MEET THE SB THREE SEVEN FIVE GOALS -- AND A LOT OF THEM ARE NOT IN AND SO I THINK WE'RE GRAPPLING WITH THIS ISSUE OF TRANSPORTATION AND HOUSING -- AND WE HAVE THESE KIND OF COMPETING IN CONFLICTING GOALS. AND SO ONE THING WHEN YOU MENTION COLLABORATION THAT I THINK IS VITAL. AS AN ENTITY LIKE THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD -- THE CTC HI THE ENERGY COMMISSION HI YOU KNOW THESE ENTITIES HAVE TO BETTER START ALIGNING THEMSELVES -- AND WORK WORKING WITH LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ULTIMATELY HAVE THE LAND USE AUTHORITY -- TO TRY AND GET US IN A LITTLE BIT MORE STRATEGIC SENSE SO WE CAN WE CAN ACHIEVE THE GOALS WE HAVE ON CLIMATE AND AIR QUALITY. OF LOSS OF IN MIND FOR THE THE IMPACT ON FAMILIES RIGHT THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU SENATOR. AND CHAIR [inaudible] Q. [inaudible] SENATOR BATES. SUPERVISOR FLETCHER CONGRATULATIONS ON THAT JOB AND YOU'VE TAKEN ON ANOTHER BIG WIN -- TO BE TE ASSIGNEE FOR THIS PARTICULAR -- COMMISSION ON YOUR RESPONSES SO FAR OR CERTAINLY TOTALLY RIGHT IN LINE WITH HOW I VIEW. BY YOUR ROLE AND I'M VERY VERY PLEASED AND I THINK WE SHARE THAT IN OUR OFFICE DISCUSSION. THAT YOU HAVE SUCH RESPECT FOR THE LEGISLATURE WAS THE ROLE IN TERMS OF THE REGULATORY STRUCTURE THAT IS APPROVED HERE BUT GOES OVER TO THEM AND YOU KNOW HOW IT'S HOW IT'S ACTUALLY IMPLEMENTED. CAN HAVING THE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES ARE QUANTIFIED AND REVIEWED ON WITH SAND ON SENATOR ROSS QUESTION WAS ONE OF MINE AND YOU'VE ANSWERED THAT ARE. REALLY IN MORE DEPTH THAN WE WOULD HAVE ANTICIPATED SO YOU HAVE A GREAT GRASP AND HAVEN'T BEEN THERE THAT LONG SO I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO BE REALLY GOOD. I DO HAVE A QUESTION REGARDING CAP AND TRADE AND WE DID TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT. BECAUSE IT WAS SIGNED NOT RECEIVED AS WELL -- INITIALLY IN TERMS OF WHERE IT WAS GOING WITHOUT -- YOUR DISCUSSION REGARDING THE BALANCE OF CAP AND TRADE AS COMPARED TO REGULATIONS I THOUGHT WAS VERY GOOD. IN TERMS OF CAP AND TRADE BEING A MORE PREFERRED METHOD YOU SHARE A LITTLE BIT OF THAT WITH THE FIRE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT IN TERMS OF THE EDUCATION. RIGHT OUT SO YOU KNOW WE NEED IN TERMS OF THE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY. WELL IN THIS THIS THIS BODY AT A AT A ROBUST DEBATE -- I SURE TO SENATOR BATES AND AND ARMENIAN I KNOW THAT THERE'S A A SEGMENT OF OF OLKS WHO WHO DON'T LIKE CAP AND TRADE -- AND THERE'S A SECOND FOLKS -- ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SPECTRUM HOSPITAL I CAPTURED -- FOR DIFFERENT REASONS THAT HAPPENED HAPPENED TO ALIGN -- BUT YOU KNOW THIS BODY CAME UP WITH THAT AND I I BELIEVE THE CAP AND TRADE IS A PIECE. OF THE TOTALITY OF HOW WE ACHIEVE OUR GOALS I DON'T BELIEVE THAT BE A CAP AND TRADE ALONE. A WE CAN GET WHERE WHERE WE NEED TO BE -- BUT THE NOTION THAT THAT WE CAN CAN SET TARGETS FOR THE THE ROUGHLY FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY ENTITIES THAT PRODUCE ABOUT 85% OF OF THE EMISSIONS -- AND AND THROUGH -- A COMBINATION OF ALLOWANCES A AND A MARKET BASED SYSTEM -- AND THEN THROUGH THE POTENTIAL FOR OFFSETS -- WHICH ARE TWO DIFFERENT COMPONENTS OF OF THE CAP AND TRADE SYSTEM. ON THAT WE CAN GET ON THE TRAJECTORY WE HAD OUR OUR TWENTY THIRTY GOALS IN A WAY THAT PROVIDES FLEXIBILITY. I TO INDUSTRY SO THAT THEY CAN CONTINUE. TO BE AN ECONOMIC ENGINE WHICH WHICH IS ALSO ALSO IMPORTANT TO US -- I THINK AS WE MONITORING WE TRACK THAT CAPTURED PROGRAM GOING FORWARD THERE'S A COUPLE THINGS WE HAVE TO BE MINDFUL OF ONE IS THAT WHAT IS THE IMPACT. BOTH PLACE. WHAT IS THE IMPACT ON CARBON EMISSIONS AND WHAT IS THE IMPACT ON THE ECONOMY -- THERE'S BEEN SOME CRITICISM -- THAT FOR SOME OF THE INDUSTRY'S WERE WE FEAR -- LEAKAGE OR A POTENTIAL MOVING TO THE FREE ALLOWANCES ARE PERHAPS TOO GENEROUS -- AND THAT'S AN ISSUE AGAIN FINDING THAT BALANCE THAT YOU HAVE TO STRIKE. ON THERE'S ALSO BEEN CONCERNED -- EXPRESS NEARLY A REPORT AND OTHERS OF THE POTENTIAL OF BANKING IN -- ALLOWANCES AT A POINT WHERE THEY'RE AT A LOWER PRICE POINT TO POTENTIALLY CASH THEM IN AND OUT YEARS WHERE IT WOULD APPEAR THAT WERE MEETING GOALS WERE NOT ACTUALLY MEETING -- AND THAT AGAIN JUST COMES BACK -- TO APPROPRIATE OVERSIGHT APPROPRIATE ADMINISTRATION ON AND ENSURING THAT THAT WE'RE PAYING ATTENTION TO WHAT'S HAPPENING -- AND MINDFUL SO THAT WE CAN WE CAN ACHIEVE BOTH OF THOSE GOALS. WELL IT'S VERY APPARENT THAT YOU'RE WELL PREPARED FOR THE FINE LINE MEANT THAT YOU'RE TAKING ON SO WE SHE WELL ANSWERED SO I'M IN LA A REPORT IN DECEMBER AND THERE'S LIKE FIVE OF THEM SO I DID A MALL THERE'S LIKE DECEMBER OF EVERY YEAR THEY ASSUME SO. CONGRATULATIONS AND I'LL BE PREPARED TO SUPPORT YOU AND WE GET TO THE VOTE THANK YOU SENATOR. I DON'T KNOW IT'S GETTING TOUGHER AND SENATOR MINING THANK YOU. MADAM CHAIR AND WELCOME HOME WELCOME BACK TO TO THE BUILDING AND WE HAD THE HONOR OF SERVING TOGETHER IN THE ASSEMBLY AND I SEE OUR FORMER SPEAKER JOHN PEDIS IS HERE. WELCOME WELCOME BACK MISTER SPEAKER TO YOU AS WELL. CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR APPOINTMENT APPRECIATED OUR OPPORTUNITY TO TALK LEAVE. INTERFACE TO THE COUPLE MEETING SAYS YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN APPOINTED BY OUR PRO TEM TO CSUS REPRESENT THE SENATE ON CARBS SO I AM LOOKING FORWARD. TO WORKING WITH YOU THERE AND I REALLY APPRECIATE YEAR. KIND OF SETTING THE STAGE IN RESPONSE TO SENATOR. WILKES QUESTION OF THE APPROPRIATE RELATIONSHIP OF PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN CARBON IN THE LEGISLATURE WHERE THERE'S SOME TENSION AND MAYBE HEALTHY TENSION BUT ALSO IMPORTANCE OF THE BUILDING COLLABORATION -- YOU DEMONSTRATED THREE WORKING KNOWLEDGE OF THE ISSUES WERE GRAPPLING WITH AND JUST POSE ONE QUESTION TO LET YOU. ON RESPOND TO AN WHEN WE SPOKE YOU YOU ADDRESS A LITTLE BUT WE'RE MAKING. PROGRESS ON A RENEWABLE ENERGY PORTFOLIO WERE FALLING BEHIND ON OUR VEHICLE -- A MISSION CHALLENGES AND YOU ALLUDED TO TRANSIT BUT MAYBE JUST SPEND A LITTLE MORE TIME HAD A WEE -- HAD WE RECTIFY. OUR OUR OUR LACK OF PROGRESS IF YOU WILL ON VEHICLE EMISSIONS WELL IN THAT THAT IS THAT IS THE REAL CHALLENGE CENTER IS THAT IS THAT WE HAVE -- YOU KNOW WERE INTRODUCTORY TO DO AS MUCH ON ON THE ENERGY SECTORS AS POSSIBLE -- TO CAP AND TRADE WERE WORKING ON YOUR STATIONARY SOURCES IN HERE YOUR THIRTY FIVE AIR POLLUTION CONTROL DISCS ARE DOING DOING WHAT THEY CAN AS WELL -- INCIDENT COMES UNDER THE ANTIS IN. YOU KNOW I I THINK IS A REGION IN THIS IS NOT. VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED -- AS A AS A AS AN ENTITY CARB. THE CARD HAS NO LAND USE OR TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY AND SO THIS IS WHERE THERE REALLY HAS TO BE THAT COLLABORATION -- BETWEEN -- OUR OUR REGIONAL PLANNING ORGANIZATIONS ARE NPOS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. IN BETWEEN OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS SO THAT WE CAN TRY AND ALIGN AS BEST WE CAN THAT THE DUAL CHALLENGES OF YOU KNOW IF WE HAVE TO BUILD MORE HOUSING WHICH I I BELIEVE MOST OF US BELIEVE WE DO -- AND WE HAVE TO ALSO NOT SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE THE VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED. AND THAT'S GOING TO REQUIRE A A RETHINKING OF OF OF OUR PRIORITIES A AND R. ALIGNMENT AND THE AND THE CHALLENGES IN FRONT OF US -- AND THAT IS GOING TO REALLY GET DOWN TO THE TO THE CRUX OF OF THAT COLLABORATIVE ISSUE -- BETWEEN THE TWO OF YOU KNOW WE HAD A AN ISSUE. SAN DIEGO JUST YESTERDAY WHERE ARE -- MPO STAND ACT I HAD A REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION PLAN THAT THE COURTS RULED WAS INCONSISTENT WITH SB THREE SEVENTY FIVE GOALS. AND THEY CAME OUT AND REVISE THAT PLAN AND PUTTING IT FORWARD TO INVESTIGATE SECONDLY MORE IN TRANSIT MOVING FORWARD -- BUT THAT'S IT'S A IT'S A TENSION IN THE IT'S A ROB AND AND THAT IS BY THINK LAYING OUT THROUGHOUT ALL OF YOUR DISTRICTS AS WE TRY AND TRYING TO LINE THESE THINGS. AND SO AT THE END OF THE DAY CARP IS GOING TO HAVE TO CONFRONT THE REALITIES OF OF THE CARS THAT ARE PUT ON THE ROAD. BY LOCAL LAND USE DECISIONS UP PERHAPS WITH WITH GREATER COLLABORATION AT A RECENT CAR MEETING -- WE SPENT A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF TIME ON A ON A FREIGHTER WAREHOUSE HANDBOOK A AS YOU SEE AN ECONOMY THIS CHANGING FROM MORE BRICK AND MORTAR RETAIL -- TO MORE DELIVERY BUT FOLKS WANT THAT DELIVERY NOW PEOPLE DON'T WANT SOMETHING SHIPPED HIM IN THREE DAYS THEY WANTED TOMORROW WELL THAT'S PUSHING WAREHOUSES AND OTHER AREAS AND WE'RE TRYING TO TALK THINK ABOUT. HOW WE CAN MAKE SUGGESTIONS OR RECOMMENDATIONS ARE WORK COLLABORATIVELY WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO ACHIEVE THOSE GOALS -- ELECTRIC VEHICLES HAVE A PROMISE. OF OF LOWERING OBVIOUSLY THERE THERE ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES AS LONG AS THE ENERGY THAT CHARGES THEM AS IS CLEAN -- BUT IN SAN DIEGO WE HAVE THREE MILLION REGISTERED VEHICLES. WE HAVE THIRTY THOUSAND ELECTRIC CARS. SO WE COULD HAVE A TEN FOLD INCREASE AND STILL BE UNDER 10% OF THE TOTAL ON THERE SOME GREAT SOCIETAL EQUITY ISSUES. AROUND ELECTRIC CARS AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES GET TALKED ABOUT A LOT AND AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES HAVE SOME POTENTIAL ESPECIALLY IF THEY'RE ZERO EMISSION BUT A A STUDY ON THE UC DAVIS SO THAT AUTONOMOUS CARS. INCREASE USAGE BY 80% BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T HAVE TO ACTUALLY DRIVE IT AND PARK IT MOVE IT YOU USE IT MORE -- AND SO I THINK THOSE ARE THINGS WE HAVE TO BE REALLY MINDFUL OF AN AND I'LL JUST SAY ONE THING. ON THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR THAT IS SO VITALLY IMPORANT. IS THE FEDERAL ROLL BACKS THAT HAVE BEEN PROPOSED AND THESE ARE GONNA HAVE DEVASTATING IMPLICATIONS FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HEY WE AS A STATE ADOPTED. WE ARE LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD FOR THE FUEL BECAUSE IN THE CAR BUT WE ADOPTED EMISSION STANDARDS FOR THE ACTUAL OPERATION OF THE VEHICLE -- AND THE MILES PER GALLON. OUR EMISSIONS STANDARDS THE ABILITY TO DO THOSE WAS A WAIVER. UNDER SECTION ONE SEVENTY SEVEN THE CLEAN AIR ACT. AND OTHER STATES HAVE ADOPTED ARE STANDARD TO THE POINT WHERE WE'RE NEARING 40% OF THE CARS IN THE COUNTRY OR ON OUR STANDARD. AND WE WORKED OUT WITH THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION THAT WOULD BECOME THE FEDERAL STANDARD MOVING FORWARD -- AND THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION HAS PROPOSED ROLLING OUT BACK NOW THE AUTO INDUSTRY AS A SUPPORT ROLE IN THE BACK -- CERTAINLY THE STATES THAT HAVE A DON'T SUPPORT ROLE IN THAT BACK. IN THE IMPACT OF THE ROLL BACK IRONICALLY WOULD LOWER MILES PER GALLON WHICH WOULD INCREASE THE COST TO CONSUMERS THEY WOULD HAVE TO PUT MORE GAS IN THERE LESS EFFICIENT CARS TO GONNA MAKE TAXPAYERS PAY MORE -- BUT IT ALSO WOULD PUT FIFTEEN MILLION METRIC TONS OF CARBON BACK HERE IT'S TWO POINT NINE CARS AND SO. FIGHTING THOSE AND EFFORTS LIKE SB ONE I THINK OR OF VITAL PART OF HAVING ANY CHANCE. TO ACHIEVE THAT THE GOALS HAVE BEEN OUTLINED IN AS YOU POINT OUT ITS MULTI FACTORIAL -- PROXIMITY OF FOUR PEOPLE WORK BY WHERE THEY HAVE TO DRIVE FOR WORK -- OUR HABITS OF PERSONAL FREEDOM AND MOBILITY IN OUR OWN CARS CHARGING STATIONS WE TALKED ABOUT. I GREW UP IN LOS ANGELES. WHERE THE AIR QUALITY WAS WORSE THAN IT IS TODAY WITH MORE VEHICLES ON THE ROAD? AND THAT'S BECAUSE OF CLEAN AIR STANDARDS CATALYTIC CONVERTERS GETTING RID OF LEADED GAS ALL OF THAT WAS GOVERNMENT. PUBLIC HEALTH INITIATIVES NOT INDUSTRY VOLUNTEERISM AND SO WE DO HAVE. TO KEEP THAT IN MIND IN WE DO HAVE TO BE VIGILANT AS THE FEDERAL LAWSUIT TO PLAN OUT OF IT -- MADAM CHAIR I WANT TO THANK YOU -- FORMER COLLEAGUE CURRENT CALLING ON KARMA I LOOK FORWARD TO OUR CONTINUED COLLABORATION AND LOOK FOR JUST SUPPORTING YOUR NOMINATION THANK YOU CENTER. THANK YOU A SENATOR MINING AND I IT'S CLEAR YOU CAME PREPARED TO TALK POLICY -- I WILL HAVE PROBABLY A COUPLE OF CLOSING COMMENTS -- AFTER WE HAVE SPEAKERS I DON'T I THINK MY COLLEAGUES HAVE DONE A VERY GOOD JOB OF ASKING QUESTIONS AND YOU'VE CERTAINLY AS AGAIN I SAID COME PREPARED.

IT'S AN HONOR TO BE HERE BEFORE YOU TODAY AND IT'S BEEN A PRIVILEGE FOR ME TO SERVE THE LAST NINE MONTHS ON THE ABC APPEALS BOARD. I'M GRATEFUL TO GOVERNOR BROWN. FOR HIS CONFIDENCE IN MY ABILITY TO CONTRIBUTE ON THIS BOARD INTO GOVERNOR NEWSOME FOR PROVIDING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE TO SERVE. SINCE MY FIRST BOARD MEETING IN AUGUST OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN I'VE BEEN COMMITTED TO LEARNING ABOUT THE APPEALS PROCESS AND I'M SORRY THANK YOU. A AND UP HOLDING THE PRINCIPLES OF FAIRNESS AND IMPARTIALITY. WITH EACH DECISION WE REVIEW. ENSURING THAT ALL LICENSEES RECEIVED TO PROCESS. WHAT I APPRECIATE ABOUT SERVING ON THE ABC APPEALS BOARD IS THE ABILITY TO SUPPORT THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA? NOT ONLY LICENSE HOLDERS WHO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXERCISE THEIR DUE PROCESS RIGHTS. BUT THE PATRONS OF THOSE ESTABLISHMENTS THAT HOLD A LICENSE AND THE PUBLIC AT LARGE. MY PREVIOUS EXPERIENCES IN THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY AS AN EXECUTIVE PRODUCER. WHICH TAUGHT ME SKILLS THAT ARE INVALUABLE TO MY ROLE ON THE BOARD FOR INSTANCE THE IMPORTANCE OF PAYING CLOSE ATTENTION. TO DETAILS WHILE KEEPING THE BIG PICTURE IN MIND. TREATING EACH STORY IS UNIQUE IN USING MY BEST JUDGMENT KNOWING MY CHOICES HAVE THE POWER TO IMPACT PEOPLE'S LIVES. I'M HOPEFUL THAT THE EXPERIENCE AND SKILLS THAT I BRING. INCLUDING THE ABILITY TO KEEP AN OPEN MIND MAKE DIFFICULT YET FAIR DECISIONS AND TREAT EACH CASE IS UNIQUE IS SOMETHING THAT CAN CONTRIBUTE TO THE MISSION AND FUTURE SUCCESS OF THIS BOARD. SO THANK YOU AGAIN AND I LOOK FORWARD TO ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE FOR ME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR MONNING I THINK I'LL START ON YOUR SIDE THIS THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. IN A MISS MCGINNIS CONGRATULATIONS TO YOU AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE TO DATE -- IN PRIOR SERVICE TO TO THE STATE. SO. I WAS ENCOURAGED BY OUR CONVERSATIONS -- I THINK WE SPENT A FAIR AMOUNT OF TIME TALKING ABOUT THE MINOR DE QUAIS PROGRAM AND PPEALS THAT COME FROM THAT THIS IS WHERE ABC UNDER AGE REPRESENTATIVES. GO IN AND BUY LIQUOR. BY DIFFERENT MEANS -- YOUR SENSE OF OF HOW THOSE APPEALS ARE BEING HANDLED AND THE EFFICACY OF THAT PROGRAM IF YOU WOULD. I I BELIEVE THE MINOR DUQUE PROGRAM IS VERY EFFECTIVE -- IT'S THE ABC DEPARTMENT WORKS WITH LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO ENSURE THAT LICENSEES ARE SAYING DILIGENT. AND RESPONSIBLE IN THEIR USE OF OF THE LICENSE AND HOLDING THAT PRIVILEGE -- SO CURRENTLY WHAT WE SEE IS A VAST MAJORITY OF MINORITY QUICK CASES WHERE -- MANY LICENSEES WILL APPEAL THE FAIRNESS OF THAT BECAUSE IT FEELS AT TIMES MAYBE LIKE A STING OPERATION. ON A ON A SMALL SCALE -- BUT WE HAVE NEVER SEEN OR OF IT SINCE I'VE SERVED ON THE BOARD I HAVEN'T SEEN A REVERSAL IN THAT REGARD SO I FEEL THAT IT'S WORKING. AND THE LICENSES ARE WHERE THE THOUGHTS OF POTENTIAL. OF HOLDING THAT HOLDING THAT-LICENSE THANK YOU AND THEN RELATED TO THAT YOU ALSO MENTIONED. A PROGRAM THAT YOU'RE MAYBE NOT DIRECTLY INVOLVED WITH AS A MEMBER THE APPEALS BOARD BUT EDUCATION A. B. C.'S DOING WITH COLLEGE AGE STUDENTS I FOUND THAT TO BE IMPORTANT AND TIMELY. YES THANK YOU THERE IS A PROGRAM THAT THE THE DEPARTMENT OF A. B. C. AND THAT'S A SEPARATE DEPARTMENT OBVIOUSLY AS YOU STATED -- BUT I'M AWARE OF A PROGRAM THAT THEY WORK WITH THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITIES. BOTH YOU SEE IN STATE AND AGE OTHER AGENCIES TO WORK ON EDUCATION AND PREVENTION OF BINGE DRINKING AND RAISING AWARENESS AROUND EXCESSIVE DRINKING ON STATE CAMPUSES. I'M NOT SURE. AGAIN HOW EFFECTIVE THE PROGRAMS ARE BUT I KNOW THAT THEY'RE MAKING EFFORTS IN THAT DIRECTION. ENGINE FOR AGING FINAL QUESTION BACK TO YOUR WORK ON THE BOARD I UNDERSTAND THERE'S YOU'RE SERVING WITH ONE OTHER MEMBER RIGHT NOW IN THEIR SOME VACANCIES. HAS THAT POSED ANY PROBLEMS IN TERMS OF SPLIT DECISIONS OR HOW DO YOU GRAPPLE IF THERE IS A DIVIDED DECISION. THANK YOU -- WE HAVE A NEW BOARD MEMBER AND NAME SUSAN BANANA AND I'M REALLY EXCITED TO BE SERVING WITH HER -- OUR FIRST BOARD MEETING TOGETHER IS TOMORROW. IN ONTARIO CALIFORNIA -- THE RULES AS FAR AS I UNDERSTAND IS THAT. IF WE WERE TO COME TO A SPLIT DECISION THAT THE DECISION WOULD REVERT BACK TO THE DEPARTMENT'S DECISION. AND IT'S AT THE GOVERNOR'S DISCRETION WHEN WE GET ANOTHER BOARD MEMBER. WELL THANK YOU AND AGAIN I'M AS WE DISCUSS TO MISS BONNIE IS A FORMER COLLEAGUE AS WELL SO PLEASE CONVEY OUR HELLO THIS IS YOU. START SERVE WITH HER I WILL DO THAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR ADULATION SINKING. THANK YOU SENATOR CENTER BATES. THANK YOU ALL AND WELCOME AND CONGRATULATIONS FOR A REAPPOINTMENT THAT'S A REAL SHOWDOWN FOR THE WORK THAT YOU HAVE DONE AND AND IN OUR DISCUSSION IN MY OFFICE SINCE. THAT YOU REALLY LIKE THE JOB AND THAT YOU REALLY WELL PREPARED AND DO A LOT OF THE HOMEWORK SO THAT YOU ARE -- WE TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT IF I MIGHT. OF GO ON WITH SENATOR THE MONEY HAD TO SAY ABOUT EDUCATION BUT MINE FOCUSES ON I THINK OUR DISCUSSION FOCUSED ON EDUCATION FOR THE LICENSEES ESPECIALLY THE SMALLER. MOM AND POP TYPE BUSINESSES THAT MIGHT MAKE MISTAKES THAT ARE HONEST MISTAKES BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T KNOW -- AND WE TALKED TO A IN DEPTH ABOUT THAT SO MY QUESTION IS -- FOLLOWS UP FROM OUR DISCUSSION FOCUSING ON EDUCATION OF THE LICENSEES AND HOW YOU MIGHT. INCREASE AND EXPAND OUT WHERE YOU SEE A TREND OF THE I DON'T KNOW SIR I DIDN'T KNOW AND I WAS THE REASON AND THEY'RE NOT ALLOWED TO NOT KNOW BECAUSE THEY GOT THEIR LICENSE THEY SHOULD. BUT I DO THINK THERE CAN BE A GAP THERE AND WE SHOULD WE DISCUSS THAT SO YOUR APPROACH TO THEY ARE GOING FORWARD DO WE HAVE A A PLAN WE MIGHT REQUIRE. A LITTLE MORE EDUCATION BEFORE THEY GET THE LICENSEWOULD THAT BE SOMETHING THAT. IS DOABLE. THANK YOU SENATOR ON THAT IS THAT WOULD BE UNDER THE DEPARTMENTS JURISDICTION SPECIFICALLY HOWEVER I AM AWARE THAT THEY HAVE A COUPLE OF PROGRAMS THAT. ARE SEEM VERY ROBUST ONE IS THE RESPONSIBLE BEVERAGE SERVICE PROGRAM AND THE OTHER IS CALLED A LEAD PROGRAM FOR LICENSEES THAT'S FREE AND VOLUNTARY SO I DON'T THE NEW. YOU KNOW THE HORIZONTAL VERSUS VERTICAL OR THE RED STRIPES ON THE CALIFORNIA DRIVER'S LICENSE. AND UNFORTUNATELY WITH THAT IS OUTSIDE OF OUR JURISDICTION TO IMPLEMENT NEW EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS BUT IT CERTAINLY AS WE SEE TRENDS AND AS WE SPOKE OF AS WE START TO SEE TRENDS IN THE APPEALS PROCESS. THAT SOMETHING WE COULD POTENTIALLY COLLABORATE WITH THE DEPARTMENT AND SAY HEY WE'RE SEEING MORE OF THIS HOW ARE WE HANDLING AND HAVE DISCUSSIONS ALONG THOSE LINES. I THINK THAT WOULD BE VERY VERY WORTHWHILE VERY VALUABLE AS WE GO FORWARD. OTHER ON AREA WE TOUCHED ON WAS THE LENGTH OF THE APPEAL PROCESS YES IN IMPROVING NOW BECAUSE BY AT THE DISTRICT LEVEL THAT'S WHAT WE ARE RECEIVE A LOT OF COMPLAINTS PEOPLE WAITING FOR A DECISION -- AND WE TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE TO AB SHORTEN OUT. YES ABSOLUTELY SO CURRENTLY THE PROCESS DOES TAKE A LITTLE BIT LONGER THAN WE WOULD LIKE -- THE ONE BENEFIT TO THAT BEING THAT THE LICENSEE. DOES HAS A STAY OF THEIR SUSPENSION OR REVOCATION AS IT WERE WHILE IT'S IN THE P. A. B. APPEALS PROCESS. SO -- THEY'RE THEY'RE ALLOWED TO CONTINUE TO OPERATE WITH THEIR FULLY OPERATIONAL. MAINTAIN THEIR LICENSE -- DURING THAT PROCESS HOWEVER THERE ARE SOME AREAS OF A BOTTLE NECK THAT I THINK THAT WE COULD IMPROVE UPON AND WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT HAS TO DO A TRANSFER OF DOCUMENTS AND I THINK IT HAS TO DO WITH TECHNOLOGY AND IMPROVING -- THAT TRANSFER BY WAY OF DIGITIZING. RECORDS FROM THE HEARINGS AND TRANSCRIPTS OF THAT NATURE TO SPEED UP THE PROCESS. WE'RE HEARING A LOT ABOUT THAT VARIOUS COMMITTEES REGARDING OUR IT SYSTEMS HERE SO IT'S GOOD TO HAVE THAT TOO MAYBE THE TO DO LIST.
