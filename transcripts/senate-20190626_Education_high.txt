BY EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS THEY PROSPER [inaudible] THEY BLOSSOM. IN THAT EDUCATION BECOMES EMPOWERING. AND THEY BECOME. SOMEWHAT MASTERS OF THEIR OWN DESTINY AND WE HAVE SEEN THE TESTIMONY. HERE. IN THE CAPITAL IN DIFFERENT COMMITTEES FROM STUDENTS WHO JUST DONE JUST THAT. STUDENTS WHO WENT ON TO GET DEGREES THEN AT THINK STUDIES. BECAUSE ETHNIC STUDIES HAS BEEN A IN EXISTENCE FOR FIFTY YEARS. ETHNIC STUDIES GREW OUT OF THE STUDENT MOVEMENT THIRD WORLD STUDENTS AT SAN FRANCISCO STATE. IN. NINETEEN SIXTY NINE BUTSTILL.

BUT THIS IS NOT MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCES ALSO ACT ACTUALLY ACADEMIC STUDIES THE TWO THOUSAND TEN THIRTY BY THE NEA COMPILED. THE EIGHTEEN DIFFERENT STUDIES FROM ACROSS THE NATION. EVERY SINGLE STUDY SHOWED BOTH AS SOCIAL AND ACADEMIC BENEFITS FOR ETHNIC STUDIES -- A STUDY DONE BY STANFORD. OF THE SAN FRANCISCO UNIFIED ETHICS THESE PROGRAMS SHOWED THAT STUDENTS WHO TOOK ETHNIC STUDIES INCREASED YOUR ATTENDANCE RATES BY 20%. GPA BY ONE POINT FOUR PERCENTAGE POINTS AND TWENTY THREE ADDITIONAL CREDITS. IT IS AMAZING THE POWER OF ETHNIC STUDIES DONE THAT COULD CAN AND AND AND DOES.

OPEN IT UP FOR QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS FROM COLLEAGUES HERE ON THE PANEL [inaudible] SENATOR PAT. THANK YOU -- THIS IS A SUMMER MEDINA AND FIRST OF ALL -- I WANT. THANK YOU FOR THE YOUR TESTIMONY AND THAT OF YOUR WITNESSES AND CERTAINLY. AT I DON'T THINK ANYONE WELL IT'S THIS WAY. CERTAINLY NOT QUESTIONING THE VALUE AND IMPORTANCE OF ETHNIC STUDIES -- I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING -- AND I KNOW THAT -- THE I GUESS THE QUESTION IS IS THAT. MY MIND IS. WHY ARE WE PURSUING THIS ROUTE -- THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE -- CURRICULA IS -- THROUGH THE CALIFORNIA FIVE EDUCATION IN FACT THIS COMMITTEE IS ADOPTED RULES TO SAY THAT. BECAUSE WE'VE HAD NUMEROUS BILLS WERE PEOPLE WANT TO PUT THINGS IN CURRICULA AND SAID THAT WELL. WE HAVE A BODY WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT YOU CATION -- THAT. DECIDES THESE THINGS THAT -- WE SHOULD SHOULDN'T BE TRYING TO LEGISLATE CURRICULA -- AND YOU KNOW FOR A AND AND IN FACT THIS BODY DECIDED BECAUSE IT'S A PEOPLE. UP AT VARIOUS BILLS FOR VARIOUS ITEMS -- OF OF IMPORTANCE -- AND SO FORTH THAT -- YOU KNOW WHAT WE SHOULD BE WE KNOW THAT WE SHOULD LIVE BASICALLY WE CAN MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE WE SUGGEST THINGS TO THE BODY AN INDICATOR THAT THE LEVEL SUPPORT FOR THAT. BUT WE SHOULDN'T BE TRYING. TO LEGISLATURE -- THE CURRICULA. AND A SO I THINK -- IN MANY WAYS THAT'S MY CONCERN IS THAT I WOULD LOVE IT IF EVERY SCHOOL DISTRICT. NO DOUBT THAT THEY YOU BILLS ACCOMPLISHED BUT A MUCH DIME BAND AS SOME CONCERNS ABOUT. THIS IS THE ROUTE WHICH WERE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH IT -- AND SO CAN YOU SPEAK. TO EFFORTS -- I MEAN IS THAT I UNDERSTAND FUND NOW THIS IS ACTUALLY SPONSORED BY THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE WHOSE OVERSEAS IN THE VERY DEPARTMENT I MEAN WHY CAN'T THE SUPERINTENDENT IN THE WAY OF THE AND EVERYONE SAID. WE SHOULDN'T. WE SHOULD DO THIS THROUGH THE USUAL WAY THAT WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE DOING THIS INSTEAD OF TRYING TO IMPOSE IT. FROM THE LEGISLATURE -- BECAUSE THERE'S MANY WERE THE THINGS AND THEY SAID THAT MAKE STUDIES CERTAINLY I THINK YOU MAKE A VERY POWERFUL CASE FOR ETHNIC STUDIES -- NAVY PEOPLE CAN'T BECAUSE POWERFUL CASE FOR OTHER THINGS BUT YEAH I THINK I THINK WE I I AM CONCERNING YOUR TEACHER -- SO I APPRECIATE THAT TO YOUR OWN EXPERIENCE THAT YOU KNOW -- YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO MANAGE A CURRICULA YOU HAVE A CERTAIN FIXED AMOUNT OF TIME WITH STUDENTS -- AND YOU HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW DO I YOU KNOW HOW TO EDUCATE. AND SO FORTH AND AND CERTAINLY I THINK -- ETHNIC SAY IS A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF THAT BUT AT CERTAIN POINTS OUT LIKE I AS THE EDUCATORS NEED TO BE ABLE. TO YOU KNOW FIGURE HIGH PUT ALL THE PIECES TOGETHER RIGHT SELF. THE LEGISLATURE SAYS I WANT MANDATE THIS COURSE HERE IN THAT CLASS AND HAS TO BE IN A CERTAIN WAY -- THAT CAN CONSTRAIN EVERY I THINK WE SAID. YOU SHOULD TEACH ETHNIC STUDIES AND THAT SHOULD BE SOMETHING. THAT STUDENTS NEED TO DEMONSTRATE COMPETENCE AND AND DAY AND AND BEFORE THEY GRADUATE THAT'S ONE THING BUT THEN THE START BEING VERY SPECIFIC ABOUT WHICH I WAS A PERHAPS YOU CAN SPEAK [inaudible] TO WHY. WHY WE'RE NOT GOING THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION WHY ISN'T THE SUPERINTEND WELL YOU CAN'T SPEAK FOR THE SUPER DEAD BODIES SPONSOR BUT I MEAN WHY ARE WE GOING THROUGH THAT ROUTE INSTEAD OF THIS -- ONE WHERE WE'RE BASICALLY TELLING DEPARTMENT OCCASION THEY HAVE TO DO SOMETHING. I MEAN YOU HAVE A LOT OF SUPPORT WILL HAVE EDUCATORS HERE -- I MEAN IT'S GREAT -- SO WHY THE WAY PEOPLE FEEL LIKE THEY CAN'T GO THROUGH THE EDUCATION ROUTE THROUGH THE EDUCATION DEPARTMENT WHERE V. OF EDUCATORS FELL EDUCATORS THERE AND WE HAVE SO MUCH SUPPORT AND EDUCATION TO ME THAT WAS EXPRESSED HERE. WHY CAN'T IT BE ACCOMPLISHED THAT WAY INSTEAD OF -- BASICALLY FROM THE OUTSIDE FRANKLY YEAH. THANK YOU SENATOR YES I I THINK IT'S AN EXCELLENT EXCELLENT QUESTION. SO AS YOU MENTIONED I WAS A TEACHER HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER. AND ONE OF THE SUBJECTS THAT I TOP WAS HISTORY -- AND GOT A MASTERS IN HISTORY -- SO I FEEL -- SOMEWHAT COMPETENT IN THE FIELD OF HIS I RECOGNIZE IS AN EXPERT IN THIS. AND I AND I WOULD SAY THAT IT IS NOT I AGREE WITH YOU. THAT IT IS NOT OR SHOULDN'T BE. THE LEGISLATURE'S ROLE TO SAY WHAT CLASSES SHOULD INCLUDE. WHETHER IT BE HISTORY. OR FOREIGN LANGUAGE OR MATH OR SCIENCE IT IS NOT THE ROLE OF THE LEAD OF THE LEGISLATURE TO SAY WHAT SHOULD BE. IN THE CURRICULUM. AND THIS BILL DOESN'T DO THAT. THIS BILL DOESN'T DO THAT AT ALL. AS I MENTIONED IN MY EARLIER REMARKS. WE HAD A ASSEMBLY MEMBER LEVEL WHO INTRODUCED THE BILL THAT PASSED THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. TO CREATE THE CURRICULUM. THEY HAVE DONE THAT NOW. THAT CURRICULUM THAT THEY CREATED. WITH INPUT FROM TEACHERS. FROM -- ACADEMICS. OF FROM PEOPLE IN THE FIELD. THEY DEVELOP THE CURRICULUM. SO WE THE LEGISLATURE. OUR HANDS OFF ON THAT AS WE SHOULD BE. AS WE SHOULD BE -- IT I THINK WOULD BE DANGEROUS FOR LEGISLATURE'SLEGISLATORS TO SAY WHAT HAS TO BE IN THE CURRICULUM SO WE DID THAT. WE DID THAT WE DID WITH DID THAT WITH THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER ALEJO'S BILL. BUT THAT'S WHAT THAT BILL DID CREATED CURRICULA. NOW THAT WE HAVE THAT CURRICULUM CORRECT ROUTE [inaudible] BY SAYING WE HAVE THIS CURRICULUM DEVELOPED BY EXPERTS INPUT. BY A BROAD VARIETY OF EXPERTS. INCLUDING TEACHERS. BUT WE THINK THAT CURRICULUM IS IMPORTANT ENOUGH THAT IT SHOULD BE TAUGHT. EVERYWHERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND THAT I DO THINK IS THE ROLE OF THE LEGISLATURE. TO SAY WHAT SHOULD BE THE REQUIREMENTS CERTAINLY FOR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS. AND LATER TODAY THERE IS A BILL THAT I AM CO AUTHOR ON ASKING -- TELLING THE CSU THAT THEY SHOULD DO THE SAME. AND AND THAT'S AN EVEN BIGGER STEP BECAUSE I WAS A COMMUNITY COLLEGE TRUSTEE. AND RESPECT THE DIFFERENTIATION BETWEEN -- GIVING THE FACULTY POWER. IN THE END IN THE COLLEGE LEVEL TOOK. TO HAVE ALL THINGS -- ACADEMIC. BUT AS I SAID ALSO IN BEEN THE BEGINNING. IT IS NOW BEEN FIFTEEN YEARS. IT HAS BEEN FIFTY YEARS SINCE. STRUGGLE BECAUSE T CAME OUT OF STRUGGLE. OF STUDENTS [inaudible] DIVERSE STUDENTS. WHO STOOD UP AND SAID YOU KNOW WE DON'T SEE OURSELVES REFLECTED? IN THE TEACHERS IN FRONT OF US IN THE COUNSELORS AT THE HIGH SCHOOLS IN THE ADMINISTRATORS. IN THE CURRICULA SO IT WAS OUT OF THAT STRUGGLE THAT THESE CLASSES THAT THIS -- CAME OUT OF AND WE'VE NOW SEEN FIFTY YEARS. WHERE NOTHING IS CHANGED? WE WE WE ARE SEEING SOME DISTRICTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SEEING THE VALUE. OF TEACHING ETHNIC STUDIES AND INCLUDING THEM IN THOSE INCLUDE -- DAVIS SANTA BARBARA [inaudible] LOS ANGELES. SO WE'VE SEEN MANY DISTRICTS CHOOSE AND AND AND TO MAKE IT A REQUIREMENT ON THEIR OWN. BUT I DO THINK IT IS THE THE THE THE JOB. OF THE LEGISLATURE TO LOOK AT THINGS HOLISTICALLY AND TO SAY. THIS. BUT NEEDS TO BE TAUGHT THIS SHOULD BE SOMETHING THAT EVERYONE. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS COMPETENT AS A TEACHER. I DO NOT SEE HOW. IF I COULD MENTION SOMEONE. SOMEONE WHO IS RESPECTED TOM BROKE OFF. SOMEONE WHO IS RESPECTED NATIONALLY IN THE UNITED STATES HOW? IS SOMEONE LIKE TOM BROKAW THE NEWSCASTER. TO MAKE COMMENTS ABOUT LATINOS -- NOT KNOWING ENOUGH ENGLISH. WE'RE NOT TRYING HARD ENOUGH TO LEARN ENGLISH HOW CAN YOU THINK OF THAT PERSON AS BEING FULLY EDUCATED. WHEN THEY MAKE STATEMENTS LIKE THAT? SO IT IS THAT [inaudible] KNOWLEDGE. THAT WE HAVE THAT WE ARE SAYING -- STUDENTS WHO DON'T HAVE THIS EDUCATION ARE LACKING. THERE SHOULD BE COMPETENT IN I DO THINK IT IS OUR ROLE TO SAY. THEY SHOULD HAVE THAT KNOWLEDGE. ALL RIGHT ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. YOUR FOLLOW UP CENTER PAN SO SO FIRST OF ALL -- AS IMMEDIATE FOR SO I WENT AND I I'LL TAKE TREMENDOUS RSPECT YOU KNOLLYS ASSEMBLY MEMBER BUT ALSO AS AN EDUCATOR AND I APPRECIATE -- YOU BRING THIS FORWARD IN YOUR DISCUSSION I A I A STILL CONTINUE HAVE CONCERNS -- SOMEONE WHO IS NOW FOR FASTER AND HIGHER EDUCATION AS WELL -- ABOUT EXACTLY OUR ROLE IN. DICTATING CURRICULA SO YOU'RE RIGHT YOU KNOW WE DID HAVE PROCESS WERE YOU KNOW THOSE THE A CARIBBEAN CRUISE CURRICULA. NUMBER DEVELOPED AROUND ETHNIC STUDIES -- I A YEAH I I SIX THOUGH. THE WAY THE BILL WAS FRAMED -- FOR IT REQUIRES A PARTICULAR COURSE -- IT I THINK IS LOW CONCERNING IS STILL CONCERNING TO ME -- IN TERMS OF I I I SUPPORT THE IDEA THAT PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE AND FLEE I'VE AS A PERSON OF COLOR WHO GREW UP WITH DIDN'T SEE VERY MUCH OF DON'T WASTE IT MYSELF -- FOR I A AND A FEW WHAT YOU'RE SAYING AND AND I I THINK THAT STERN CERTAINLY I AGREE WITH YOU THERE ARE -- THERE IS A LOT OF THERE IS TREMENDOUS IGNORANCE OF OF OF OF OF THE HISTORY OF MANY OF THOSE PEOPLE TO ACTUALLY TO WHO WHO -- NOW HE LIVES -- BUT CONTRIBUTE TO OUR COUNTRY THE PEOPLE ARE NOT AWARE OF THE HISTORY OF AND A I OPENED MYSELF I HAVE I'VE IGNORANCE IN MANY AREAS AS WELL AND THROUGH MY OWN EDUCATION. AS MUCH AS AS MUCH SCHOOLS HAVE GONE THROUGH PRIDE MORE SO THAN ANY -- IT BUT I A YOU KNOW IT AS AN EDUCATOR I STILL HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT -- NOT WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO TEACH BUT AT X. WHICH I THINK IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT MADE A VERY POWERFUL CASE WITNESSES A MADE A VERY POWERFUL CASE I THE THE THE ROUTE WHICH WE'RE GOING TO IN TERMS OF TRYING TO AND HOW WE'RE TRYING TO DICTATE IT. AND I I HAVE CONCERNS THAT ABOUT THE LEGISLATURE DOING THAT -- VERSES -- OTHER MECHANISMS BUT I I DO APPRECIATE YOU BRING THIS FORWARD THANK YOU THANK YOU SENDER TO RAZA. YES -- I TO WANT TO THANK YOU -- I'M SURE EVERY SINGLE OF CHICANO LATINO AFRICAN AMERICAN WHO WENT THROUGH THE STRUGGLE OVER THE MANY DECADES IN THE PAST CAN POINT TO OUR OWN STORIES. OF THE IMPACT THAT TAKE INTO A CLASS -- SO YOUR STORY PLACE TO ME MANY MANY YEARS AGO OF NOT EVER HAVING READ ANYTHING. IN HISTORY BOOKS OR IN ANY BOOK ABOUT THE CONTRIBUTIONS ARE ON THE PRESENCE. OTHER THAN -- NATIVE AMERICANS IN A VERY. NOT IN A VERY POSITIVE WAY IN A VERY NEGATIVE WAY. SO I I APPRECIATE EVERYONE'S -- ROLE IN MOVING THIS FORWARD -- I WOULD. I WOULD -- WITH REGARD TO MY COLLEAGUE CENTER PANS -- CONCERNS I WOULD NORMALLY HAVE THE SAME CONCERN I WOULD START OUT WITH WITH THAT CONCERNED -- BECAUSE WE DO WANT TO LIMIT WHAT THE RULE IS AND MAKE SURE THAT IT'S ABSOLUTELY AN ESSENTIAL PART OF WHAT. OUR RESPONSIBILITIES ARE. BUT HAVING BEEN THROUGH THE STRUGGLE AND HAVING SEEN THAT LIKE YOU SAID AT LEAST FIFTY YEARS AGO THAT THE STARTED THAT TIME COMES WHEN. LEGISLATURE HAS TO STEP IN BECAUSE IT'S NOT GETTING DONE AND WE'RE OF THE MIND WE DO THAT IN A NUMBER OF SUBJECTS IN A NUMBER OF AREAS. WE DO THAT WITH HEALTH WE DO THAT WITH OTHER THINGS WHEN IT'S NOT GETTING DONE RIGHT. GOVERNMENT HAS TO STEP IN TO CORRECT IT -- I WOULD PREFER. IN A MUCH MUCH OF A BIGGER WAY I WOULD PREFER THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE THE WE SPOKE OF THE REQUIREMENT OF THOSE SPECIFIC ETHNIC STUDIES. I WOULD PREFER THAT HISTORY BOOKS INCLUDED US WITHOUT HAVING ETHNIC STUDIES REQUIRED -- I THINK IT'S SHAMEFUL I THINK IT'S SHAMEFUL THAT WOMEN'S ROLES THE LGBT Q. ROLE THAT THE THE ROLE OF ETHNIC GROUPS. I THINK IT'S SHAMEFUL THAT OUR HISTORY BOOKS DO NOT REFLECT THE TRUTH. OF WHAT WHAT HAS BEEN THE HISTORY OF THIS COUNTRY IN OF THE WORLD. SO -- I THINK THERE ARE TIMES WHEN WE DO HAVE TO STEP IN AND I THINK THIS IS ONE OF THOSE FEW TIMES SO. I APPRECIATE AND SUPPORT YOU. VERY GOOD -- I OUT ONE AT SHARE MY THOUGHTS AS WELL -- BUT FIRST I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP IN THIS AREA I WANT TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER LIKE HELL FOR HIS LEADERSHIP PRIOR TO YOU AND THERE'S SO MANY OTHERS WHO HAVE. TRIED TO LEAD IN THIS AREA NOT NECESSARILY THROUGH LEGISLATION BUT THROUGH ACTIVISM ON OUR CAMPUSES. AND IN OUR COMMUNITIES -- THERE'S NO DOUBT IN MY MIND THAT ETHNIC STUDIES IS A CRITICAL. UP POINT OF UNDERSTANDING FOR US IN CALIFORNIA FOR US AS A SOCIETY. THAT -- WITHOUT THAT TYPE OF UNDERSTANDING. AND TOLERANCE OUR WHOLE COHESION AS A COMMUNITY AS A STATE AS A COUNTRY AS  WORLD -- IS IS IN JEOPARDY. AND SO IT IS SO IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE THAT UNDERSTANDING -- THE DILEMMA FOR ME IN YOUR BILL THOUGH IS SIMILAR TO DOCTOR PANS THE ISSUE THAT HE HAS RAISED. AS I UNDERSTAND IT THE LEGISLATURE IN THEIR WISDOM HAS A IT HAS DIRECTED. THAT MODEL CURRICULUM THE ESTABLISHED IN THIS AREA. AND THAT WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF DOING THAT RIGHT NOW. IT'S COMPLETED SENATOR. OKAY ACCORDING TO THE ANALYSIS. SAYS THAT THE THE INSTRUCTIONAL QUALITY COMMISSION. HAS TO SUBMIT THE MODEL CURRICULUM BY DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST TWENTY NINETEEN HAVE THEY ALREADY DONE THAT. RIGHT THE GROUP MODEL CURRICULUM AS HAS BEEN COMPLETED. I IT IS NOW MY UNDERSTANDING AND IF THERE'S ANYONE HERE FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION THE MY CORRECT ME. BUT THE THE MODEL CURRICULUM HAS BEEN COMPLETED. IT'S ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED PAGES IT'S ON MY DESK -- AND IT IS NOW LOOK -- THE TIME FOR PUBLIC REVIEW. OF THAT MODEL GET KILLED AND THAT THAT THAT'S CONSISTENT WITH THE ANALYSIS THE HOUSES SAYS THAT THERE'S A DEADLINE FOR COMPLETING THE DRAFT IT'S GOING THROUGH THAT. REVIEW PROCESS THAT THE THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION HAS TO ADOPT THE CURRICULUM. BY MARCH THIRTY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY SO WE HAVE A PROCESS IN PLACE YOU JUST ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THAT WHICH IS GOOD. THAT THEY'RE TRYING TO PROVIDE. A AT WITH GOOD WISDOM THIS MODEL CURRICULUM FOR HOW THE SCHOOLS CAN TEACH ETHNIC STUDIES RIGHT. AND THE EFFORT TO TRY TO PROMOTE AND ENCOURAGE OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO TEACH ETHNIC STUDIES SO THAT. THAT PROCESS IS IS IS GOING. AHEAD. AND WITH THE MARCH. TWENTY TWENTY DEADLINE FOR THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION TO ENGAGE SO THE DILEMMA FOR ME IS IS THAT TYPICALLY WHEN -- THAT THE QUESTION OF IS THERE A COMPELLING STATE NEED FOR US TO GET INVOLVED IN ALL KINDS OF THINGS. YOU HAVE TO LOOK AND SAY OKAY. WHAT'S THE PROGRESS OF THE WORK BEING DONE. AND ARE THERE ROAD BLOCKS TO IT THAT WE SHOULD BE AWARE OF EYES ARE OPPOSITION TO IT THAT WE SHOULD BE AWARE OF HAVE SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAD THE CHANCE TO ENACT THIS AND THEY HAVEN'T. TAKEN THOSE STEPS THESE ARE ALL THE QUESTIONS THAT GO THROUGH MY HEAD. AND I GUESS THAT THAT LEAVES ME. SHORT TO THE EXTENT THAT. WE HAVEN'T EVEN GIVEN THAT MODEL CURRICULUM YET. THAT THERE HASN'T BEEN THE ENGAGEMENT THAT I'M AWARE OF AND MAYBE YOU CAN SHARE -- WHAT YOU NOW? WHERE SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT SAID NO NO NO NO NO WE HAVE A THOUSAND SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE WE GIVEN THE CHANCE TO DO THE RIGHT THING -- BECAUSE CLEARLY THEIR WORK IS LACKING I WE AGREE. BUT I SEE HOW MANY KIDS ARE TAKING AT THINK STUDIES 1% THAT'S EMBARRASSING. AND IS THAT OUR FAULT WE'RE WE'RE NOT PROVIDING THAT CURRICULUM OR IS OR SOME OTHER PLACE WHERE WE CAN BE WORKING TOGETHER TO MAKE THAT BETTER. BUT THAT'S REALLY MY FIRST QUESTION TO YOU IS IS WHAT WHAT HAVE WE DONE TO GIVE THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS THEIR ABILITY TO DO THE RIGHT THING BEFORE WE STEP IN. SOME SCHOOL DISTRICTS LIKE DAVIS THAT RECENTLY ADOPTED ETHNIC STUDIES. AS RECENT AS LAST MONTH. HAVE SAID WHY WAIT FOR THIS LEGISLATION TO GET PAST AND THEY HAVE SAID THAT AT THEIR MEETINGS. AT THEIR BOARD MEETINGS AND WE SAW HERE -- A SEVERAL SCHOOL BOARD MEMBERS IN SUPPORT OF A OF THIS BILL. I I I KNOW THAT. I I WOULD SAY THAT EVERYONE HERE WHO'S TESTIFIED -- WHICH SHARE MY OWN CONCERN. THAT IT IS ONE THING TO CREATE CURRICULUM FOR DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION IS ANOTHER THING TO IMPLEMENT THAT CURRICULA AND SO. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION SOMETIMES CREATES CURRICULUM LIKE THEY DID FOR THE SEVEN SAYS ARE CHAVEZ HOLIDAY. OR PERHAPS THE WHOLE COST. BUT IT IS ANOTHER THING TO SEE THAT CURRICULUM IMPLEMENTED IN THE DISTRICTS. AND AND I WOULD BE VERY HAPPY. IF EVERY ONE OF THOSE ONE THOUSAND SCHOOL DISTRICTS ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. DID LIKE DAVIS. OR SANTA BARBARA. AND ON THEIR OWN SAID WE WERE GOING TO DO THIS. BUT I THINK THEY'VE HAD TIME TO DO THAT ALREADY. YOU KNOW IT'S BEEN AGAIN FIFTY YEARS. I AM NOT GONNA LIVE ANOTHER FIFTY YEARS. BUT I WOULD HATE. THAT MY GREAT GRAND CHILDREN WOULD STILL BE HAVING THE SAME CLASSES. BEING TAUGHT THE SAME THINGS THAT ARE BEING TAUGHT TODAY I WOULD RESPECTFULLY SAY THAT. WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO DO IS GET BOTH THINGS ON AT THE SAME TIME THAT WHEN THE CURRICULUM IS IS READY? BECAUSE OUR BILL SAYS THAT THIS WOULD BECOME A HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATE XIN REQUIREMENT AND TWENTY TWENTY FOUR TWENTY TWENTY FIVE GIVING SCHOOL DISTRICTS. AMPLE TIME TO PREPARE TRAIN THEIR TEACHERS. GET THE CURRICULUM SO WE ARE WORKING HAND IN HAND WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. AS AS YOU NOTED [inaudible] THEY ARE. A SPONSOR OF THIS BILL. AND TONY THURMOND STATE SUPERINTENDENT WAS WITH ME -- WHEN HE WHEN WE PRESENTED THIS BILL IN THE -- ASSEMBLY THEY ARE GETTING COMMITTEE WELL AGAIN THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP AND SI I THINK THAT THAT IS THE ISSUE THAT GIVES ME PAUSE NOT ABOUT THE BELIEF AND THE DESIRE. TO HAVE THAT UNDERSTANDING THAT BROADER UNDERSTANDING OF OUR OF OUR WORLD AND OUR CLASSES BUT THAT. THAT WE SEEM TO BE ON ATTRACTED TO PROVIDE THAT MODEL CURRICULUM AND THAT HOPEFULLY HAVE OURS ARE EDUCATIONAL LEADERS TAKE THE RIGHT STEPS TO INCORPORATED. AND I THINK THAT'S A BETTER PROCESS TO PLAY OUT THAN US CREATING A MANDATE -- RIGHT UP FRONT EVEN THOUGH FOR SUCH A GOOD AND IMPORTANT BECAUSE AS YOU AS YOU PROMOTES THAT BE MY MY CONCLUDING COMMENTS. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS. ALL RIGHT BEFORE I ENTERTAIN A MOTION I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BEING SO -- DOGGETT IN THIS I I BELIEVE THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER ALEJO'S HAD THIS BILL WHEN I FIRST CAME TO THE SENATE AND I WAS HAPPY TO VOTE FOR THEN. I VOTED FOR YOUR BILL LAST YEAR I WILL BE SUPPORTING IT THIS YEAR. WE ARE WORKING ON MODEL CURRICULUM BUT I THINK WHAT I WORRY ABOUT IS EXACTLY WHAT YOU SAID ASSEMBLYMEMBER IT'S BEEN FIFTY YEARS AND SOMETIMES WE CANNOT RELY ON PEOPLE AND WAIT FOR THEM TO DO THE RIGHT THING OUT OF THE GOODNESS OF THEIR HEART. AND OUR JOB IS TO LEGISLATE AND LEGISLATING THIS IS MEANING THAT PEOPLE WILL BE FORCED TO LEARN ABOUT EACH OTHER AND GUESS WHAT WHEN WE LEARN ABOUT EACH OTHER WE'RE GOING TO DISCOVER THAT WE HAVE MORE IN COMMON. THAN NOT A MAYBE IT WILL CREATE A BETTER WORLD BECAUSE THEN WILL UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER AND WE WON'T DISLIKE EACH OTHER SO I APPRECIATE YOU BEING SO DOG IN THIS -- HAPPY TO SUPPORT IT -- DO DO WE HAVE A MOTION I'M SORRY TO STEP BACK OKAY THE BILL HAS BEEN MOVED BY. SENATOR TORONTO. WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE SORRY THANK YOU SENATOR. I I VERY MUCH WANT TO THANK ALL THE WITNESSES THE STUDENTS THE TEACHERS PROFESSORS.

THANK YOU IF YOU HAVE A CONVERSATION TAKE IT OUTSIDE PLEASE PROCEED THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AB ONE THIRTY ESTABLISH THE HIGHER EDUCATION PERFORMANCE AND ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION AS A STATEWIDE POST SECONDARY COORDINATION AND PLANNING ENTITY. WE HAVE BEEN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE ADMIN WITHOUT A PLANNING ENTITY TO COVER ARE ARE A COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE SEE ISSUE IN ARE YOU SEE SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE WHEN THE SYSTEM WE HAD IN PLACE WAS DE FUNDED IN. TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN AFTER IT WAS. AS THE BUDGET IS STATE WAS GOING TO VERY HARD BUDGET TIMES IT WAS CONTINUING KIND OF CHIPPED AWAY AT A AND THAT LEAVES US -- I THINK IT'S ONLY ONE OF TWO STATES IN THE NATION THAT DOES NOT HAVE AN OVERALL COORDINATING. BODY -- COORDINATING FOR OUR GOALS COORDINATING FOR WHERE WE MIGHT HAVE AN A A NEW CAMPUS -- OVERALL -- HOW THE STUDENTS ARE DOING A AND SO BRED AS AS WE STAND RIGHT NOW THE WHEN WE TALK ABOUT LEAVING NO STOOD BEHIND AND WE KNOW THEY WERE? THIRTY THOUSAND CALIFORNIA STUDENTS WITHOUT A SEAT LAST TIME AND AND THE NEW AUDITS WE HEAR ALL THE TIME. ABOUT SOMETIMES AS MANY NOT BEING SPENT AS IT WAS ACCOUNTED. FOR IT JUST SEEMS TO ME THAT IT IS NOW THE TIME TO RE INSTATE THE OVERSEEING BODY. THAT WOULD BE ABLE TO SERVE -- IN THIS AND I AND I'M ALSO AWARE THAT THERE IS ANOTHER BILL MOVING ON THE SENATE SIDE AND WE REALIZE AT SOME POINT WE WILL HAVE TO COORDINATE THE TWO OF THOSE BILLS. AND WE ARE STANDING BY READY TO DO THAT -- THE COMMISSION WAS BORN IN THE NINETEEN SIXTY MASTER PLAN -- AND WE GOT AND WE WENT A LONG TIME AND BEING THE MODEL FOR THE WORLD AND I THINK AS WE ALL KNOW WITH BUDGET CUTS WE'VE TAKEN SOME STUMBLES AND WE THINK PUTTING BACK INTO PLACE A COORDINATING BODY. WOULD SERVE THAT IN TODAY I HAVE WITH ME. CHECK BRENNER WITH THE CAT CAMPAIGN FOR COLLEGE OPPORTUNITY. TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU SEVEN MEMBER BEGIN WHEN YOU'RE READY.

ONE THIRTY WE KNOW THAT IN THE COMING YEARS CALIFORNIA WILL NEED A GROWING SUPPLY OF EDUCATED WORKERS TO MEET THE DEMANDS OF OUR DYNAMIC STATE ECONOMY. AND KEEP FOR BILLING THIS NEED WILL BE ENSURING THAT THE ACCESS AND SUCCESS OF POPULATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN HISTORICALLY UNDERREPRESENTED IN HIGHER EDUCATION. YET AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER EGGMAN POINTED OUT CALIFORNIA CURRENTLY STANDS AS ONE OF ONLY TWO STATES WITHOUT A STATEWIDE COORDINATING BODY FOR HIGHER EDUCATION. MEANING WE LACK THE STATE LEVEL LEADERSHIP RESPONSIBLE FOR PLANNING OVERSIGHT AND COORDINATION TO POSITION OUR STATE TO MEET THESE CHALLENGES WE NEED A BODY THAT IS NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY ONE SECTOR OR SEGMENT. BUT RATHER UNDERSTANDS THE BROADER NEEDS OF THE STATE AND CAN FACILITATE THE NECESSARY CONVERSATIONS ANALYSIS AND EXPERTISE TOWARDS THESE GOALS. WELL IN PERFECT THE FORMER CALIFORNIA POSTSECONDARY EDUCATION COMMISSION WITH ABLE TO OFFER ENROLLMENT PROJECTIONS ASSESS REGIONAL DEMANDS CRITICAL INFORMATION TO INFORMING POLICY AND BUDGETARY DECISIONS. IN ITS ABSENCE THE CAMPAIGN FOR COLLEGE OPPORTUNITY AND MANY OF OUR PARTNERS. ARE ASKED TO HELP FILL THE VOID IN VARIOUS WAYS WHICH IS NEITHER SUSTAINABLE NOR IDEAL IN A STATE WITH SYSTEMS AS LARGE AND COMPLEX AS CALIFORNIANS. AB ONE THIRTY RECOGNIZES THIS CRITICAL VOID AND ESTABLISHES STATE LEVEL LEADERSHIP POSITION TO CONFRONT THESE CHALLENGES. IMPORTANTLY IT ALSO PRESENTS AN OPPORTUNITY AND MEANS FOR THE STATE TO ARTICULATE A LONG RANGE VISION FOR HIGHER EDUCATION WITH CLEAR AND ACTIONABLE GOALS FOR ENSURING COLLEGE ACCESS. STUDENT SUCCESS AS WELL AS CLOSING THE RACIAL AND REGIONAL EQUITY GAPS THAT ARE NECESSARY TO MEETING FUTURE WORK FORCE NEEDS -- SO WITH THAT AT THANK YOU AND RESPECTFULLY URGE YOUR AYE VOTE.

HI LEYVA AYE WILK CHAIN LASSELL. WHO ASAL AYE GLAZER GLAZER AYE MCGUIRE PAN? THE BILL ON CALL THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. ALRIGHT WE'RE MOVING ON TO FILE ITEM FIVE ASSEMBLY MEMBER SMITH COME ON DOWN. YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO BILLS TO PRESENT WOULD YOU LIKE TO START WITH AB. TEN FIFTY ONE ALL RIGHT VERY GOOD BEGIN WHENEVER YOU'RE READY CHAIR GOOD MORNING MEMBERS. AB TEN FIFTY ONE SPONSORED BY THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE WOULD RE ESTABLISH AN EXEMPTION INITIALLY PUT INTO STATUTE IN TWO THOUSAND SIX FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGE NURSING FACULTY TO EXCEED THE PART TIME FACULTY COURSE LOAD CAP. ALLOWING FOR MORE CONTINUITY IN CLINICAL NURSING EDUCATION. UNLIKE OTHER PROGRAMS NURSING REQUIRES EXTENSIVE CLINICAL COMPONENTS ON TOP OF TIME IN THE CLASSROOM REQUIRING CLINICAL ROTATIONS EXTENDING SIX TO EIGHTEEN WEEKS IN TWELVE HOUR SHIFTS ONE TO TWO DAYS A WEEK. MANY CLINICAL NURSING INSTRUCTORS CONTINUE TO SERVICE PRACTICING LICENSE NURSES WHILE TEACHING LEADING TO A LARGER NUMBER OF PART TIME NURSING FACULTY. UNDER EXISTING LAW COURSE LOADS FOR PART TIME COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND ADULT EDUCATION FACULTY ARE CAPPED AT 67%. OF THE HOURS PER WEEK OF A FULL TIME COURSE LOAD WHICH IS APPROXIMATELY TWO COURSES. THIS CAP RESULTS IN INSTRUCTOR CHANGES IN THE MIDDLE OF ROTATION INTERRUPTING STUDENTS LEARNING PROCESS AND INTERRUPTING THE CARE AT THE CLINICAL SITES. AB TEN FIFTY ONE WOULD PERMIT PART TIME CLINICAL NURSING FACULTY TO BE EMPLOYED BY ANY ONE COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT FOR UP TO FOUR SEMESTERS OR SIX QUARTERS ALLOWING COMMUNITY COLLEGES ACROSS THE STATE. TO SERVE AT LEAST THREE HUNDRED FIFTY ONE ADDITIONAL STUDENTS PER YEAR IN NURSING PROGRAMS AND ENCOURAGING THE HIRING OF PRACTICING LICENSE NURSES WHO WILL BRING VALUABLE AND RELEVANT REAL WORLD EXPERIENCE TO THE EDUCATIONAL ENVIRONMENT. WITH ME TODAY IS ALLOWED TO WITNESSES IN SUPPORT JUSTIN SALAS NICK LEGISLATIVE ALLEN ANALYST FOR THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE AND AUSTIN WEBSTER OUT REPRESENTING SEVERAL COMMUNITY COLLEGES. BOTTOM YOU CHECK TWO MINUTES. A GOOD MORNING CHEN MEMBERS JUSTIN SELLING COMBAT FOR THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE BOARD OF GOVERNORS THE SPONSOR OF AB. TEN FIFTY ONE A BY REMOVING THE FACULTY. THE SCENARIO THAT WAS DESCRIBED BY THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER WHERE AN INSTRUCTOR MUST BE REPLACED IN THE MIDDLE OF A TERM WOULD BE AVOIDED. AS YOU CAN IMAGINE IT IS DIFFICULT FOR AN INSTRUCTOR TO PROPERLY EVALUATE THE STUDENT THAT THEY HAVE NOT BEEN WITH SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE SEMESTER. THIS MID TERM ON BOARDING IS DISRUPTIVE TO THE INSTRUCTORS OF THE STUDENTS AND THE CLINICAL FACILITY THAT IS HOSTING THE PROGRAM. AB TEN FIFTY ONE IS ALSO NEEDED BECAUSE OF THE DIFFICULTY COMMUNITY COLLEGE NURSING PROGRAMS HAVE IN FINDING FULL TIME FACULTY. FOR EXAMPLE OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS VENTURA COLLEGE HAS HAD THREE TO FIVE ON FIELD OPENINGS FOR FULL TIME NURSING FACULTY. RECENTLY THEY WERE FORCED TO REDUCE EMISSIONS BY 20% AND THEIR ASSOCIATES DEGREE OF NURSING PROGRAMS. IN THE EXEMPTION AND AB TEN FIFTY ONE WOULD HAVE ALLOWED THE COLLEGE TO ACCEPT IN THEIR NORMAL THAT MISSION NUMBERS. COMMUNITY COLLEGE NURSING PROGRAMS ARE HIGH QUALITY AND AFFORDABLE OPTIONS THAT PROVIDE SOCIAL MOBILITY TO STUDENTS FROM DIVERSE BACKGROUNDS FROM ALL OVER CALIFORNIA. AND AB TEN FIFTY ONE IS A VALUABLE TOOL THAT DISTRICTS CAN UTILIZE TO MAXIMIZE THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS THE GENERAL THANK YOU. THANK YOU PROCEED WHEN YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU CHAIR OF LATIN SENATORS ALSO WEBSTER ON BEHALF OF THE COAST COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT RANCHO SANTIAGO COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT AND THE ORANGE COUNTY COMMUNITY COLLEGE LEGISLATIVE TASK FORCE. WE JUST WANNA BRIEFLY LINER COMMENTS WITH THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT TOOL FOR OUR PROGRAMS -- IT'S IN SPECIALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE THESE -- ABILITY TO BRING IN THESE THESE GUYS PRACTITIONERS ARE COMING IN AND ACTUALLY HAVING THE HANDS ON EXPERIENCE -- AND THEN PREVENTING THESE DISRUPTIONS AS MENTIONED BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER SMITH -- IMPROVE STUDENT OUTCOMES AND JUST GENERALLY IS -- THE BEST PRACTICE THAT WE WANT TO HAVE AVAILABLE FOR COLLEGES SO WE ARE DRY VOTE. THANK YOU OTHERS IN SUPPORT. IS THERE ANY OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. SEEING AND HEARING THAT WILL BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS CONCERNS. DO WE HAVE A MOTION. THANK YOU SENATOR. AS A BLOOM YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND CONSIDERATION I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU THE BILL HAS BEEN MOVED BY SENATOR DORADO MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. ITEM FIVE AB TEN FIFTY ONE THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS LEYVA. LEAVE THE I WILL WILK AYE CHANGE -- ASAL LUNA SO I GLAZER PLEASE ARE AYE MCGUIRE PAN. THAT BILL ON CALL A AND NOW I THINK YOU HAVE AB. SEVENTEEN TWENTY NINE PROS PROCEED WHEN YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU AGAIN MADAM CHAIR AND HELLO MEMBERS. DUAL ENROLLMENT PROGRAMS PARTICULARLY THOSE WHICH TAKE PLACE ON HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTION CAMPUSES HAVE SHOWN TO BE EXCELLENT TOOLS FOR ENCOURAGING COLLEGE READINESS. PARTICIPATING STUDENTS ARE MORE LIKELY TO COMPLETE COLLEGE THAN THEIR NON PARTICIPATING PEERS. AND CONCURRENT ENROLLMENT HAS PROVEN PARTICULARLY EFFECTIVE FOR YOUNG MEN OF COLOR LOW INCOME STUDENTS AND FIRST GENERATION STUDENTS. NOT ONLY GAIN VALUABLE CAREER SKILLS OR EARNED GENERAL EDUCATION UNITS THAT CAN TRANSFER TO A FOUR YEAR UNIVERSITY BUT THEY ALSO LEARNED THEY CAN BE SUCCESSFUL IN COLLEGE. THIS GIVES THEM THE CONFIDENCE TO CONTINUE WITH COLLEGE AFTER HIGH SCHOOL AND PUTS THEM ON A PATH TOWARD ACHIEVING THEIR ACADEMIC GOALS. SUMMER IS THE IDEAL TIME FOR STUDENTS TO PARTICIPATE IN DUAL ENROLLMENT PROGRAMS AS STUDENTS ARE FREE OF THE RESPONSIBILITIES AND WORKLOAD THAT COME WITH THE REGULAR ACADEMIC YEAR. HOWEVER CURRENT LAW LIMITS THE NUMBER OF HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS WHO CAN ENROLL IN SUMMER COURSES AT OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES. ONLY 5% OF STUDENTS PER GRADE LEVEL PER SCHOOL ARE PERMITTED TO ENROLL IN THESE PROGRAMS. AB SEVENTEEN TWENTY NINE EXPANDS COLLEGE ACCESS FOR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS DURING THE SUMMER BY REMOVING THAT 5% CAP FOR STUDENTS WHO ENROLL IN GENERAL EDUCATION COURSES THAT TRANSFER TO A FOUR YEAR UNIVERSITY OR A CAREER PATHWAY. THIS BELIEVES IN PLACE RESTRICTIONS ON PHYSICAL EDUCATION COURSES AND COURSES DURING THE REGULAR ACADEMIC YEAR. AND WITH ME TODAY AS A WITNESS IN SUPPORT IS ERIC HARNISCH FROM THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT A COLLEGE OF THE CANYONS IN SANTA CLARITA. THANK YOU WELCOME. I'M SHOULD THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY IN SUPPORT OF AB -- SEVENTEEN TWENTY NINE WHICH PROMISES TO HELP MORE HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS FIND THAT THEY HAVE A PLACE IN COLLEGE. THERE ARE COLLEGE MORE THAN A THOUSAND HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS GET A JUMP START. ON COLLEGE EACH YEAR -- BY TAKING CLASSES AT COLLEGE OF THE CANYONS. THEY NOT ONLY GAIN VALUABLE CAREER SKILLS WERE GENERAL EDUCATION UNITS A CAN TRANSFER TO A FOUR YEAR UNIVERSITY. BUT THEY ALSO LEARN THEY CAN BE SUCCESSFUL IN COLLEGE. THIS GIVES THEM THE CONFIDENCE TO CONTINUE WITH COLLEGE AFTER HIGH SCHOOL AND PUT THEM ON A PATH TOWARD ACHIEVING THEIR ACADEMIC GOALS. AND THEY SUCCEED ACADEMICALLY HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS REGULARLY OUTPERFORM THE COLLEGE AGE STUDENTS AND THEY'RE SITTING NEXT TO IN THEIR CLASSES. AS OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM CONTINUES. TO IT'S EFFORTS TO MEET THE AMBITIOUS VISION FOR SUCCESS GOALS OF INCREASING DEGREES AND CERTIFICATES TRANSFERRING MORE STUDENTS TO FOUR YEAR UNIVERSITIES AND HELPING MORE STUDENTS SUCCESSFULLY MOVED FROM CLASSROOMS TO CAREERS. THESE ARE THE KINDS OF OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE NEED TO CREATE. AB SEVENTEEN TWENTY NINE OFFERS MORE FLEXIBILITY FOR STUDENTS GIVING THEM THE OPPORTUNITY TO ENROLL IN ALMOST ANY COURSE A COMMUNITY COLLEGE OFFERS DURING THE SUMMER. AS THE SUMMER WOMAN SAID SUMMER IS THE IDEAL TIME FOR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS TO ENROLL. AND AS THEY ARE FREE THE RESPONSIBILITIES IN WORKLOAD THE COME WITH THE REGULAR ACADEMIC YEAR. MOREOVER THEY TAKE THE CLASSES AT THE COLLEGE CAMPUS GIVING THEM A CHANCE TO EXPERIENCE CAMPUS LIFE. MAKE USE OF AVAILABLE SUPPORT RESOURCES LIKE FREE TUTORING AND LEARN THEY CAN INDEED BE SUCCESSFUL IN COLLEGE. THIS IS WHAT PERRANCE TELLS THAT THEY WANT FOR THEIR STUDENTS WHEN WE SURVEYED PARENTS OF ELEVENTH AND TWELFTH GRADERS RECENTLY. 88% OF THEM EXPRESSED INTEREST IN THEIR SUDENTS TAKING CLASSES AT COLLEGE OF THE CANYONS. AB SEVENTEEN TWENTY NINE WOULD ALLOW MORE THAN TO DO JUST THAT. SO I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. GROWING WE HAVE FOR THE WONDERFUL COMPANY IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT IS THERE ANY OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COMMENTS CENTER GLAZER -- YES ASSEMBLY WOMAN -- I WANT TO COMMEND YOU ON THIS BILL I THINK IT'S A FANTASTIC BILL I I THINK WE CREATE ALL THESE -- BUREAUCRACIES THAT PREVENT -- OUR EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM FOR TREATING KIDS AS THEY ARE ABLE TO AND TO MATCH THEIR CAPACITY. AND THERE'S SO MANY THINGS ABOUT THIS BILL AND THE OPPORTUNITY THAT IT MAY PROVIDE TO STUDENTS THAT'S JUST ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL I KNOW YOU HAD THE WONDERFUL COMPANY SPEAK UP A MOMENT AGO. INSPIRED MY WONDERFUL IN THIS -- IF THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY DOWN THE ROAD IF YOU EVER AMEND THE BUILD UP TO BE A CO AUTHOR THANK YOU AND HAPPY TO MOVE IT CHEERS REQUEST. THANK YOU CENTER GLAZER ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS WHICH I TO CLOSE CERTAINLY I AM THINKING SENATORS FOR YOUR TIME AND I HAVE THE THE PRIVILEGE OF REPRESENTING COLLEGE OF THE CANYONS ALONG WITH US SENATOR WILK AND WE'VE SEEN IN OUR OWN COMMUNITIES HOW OFTEN STUDENTS -- OF EVERY TYPE AND EVERY GRADE LEVEL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS DURING HIGH SCHOOL WHEN THEY CANNOT PRESENTS A TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM TO KIND OF DIP THEIR FEET IN THE COLLEGE EXPERIENCE. TO TEST OUT THEIR LEVEL OF INTEREST IN IN DIFFERENT COURSE WORK AND IT'S A TREMENDOUS SAVINGS TO THE STUDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES WHEN THEY'RE ABLE TO DO THIS IN A AND A WONDERFUL OPPORTUNITY SO. I APPRECIATE YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE BILL HAS BEEN MOVED BY CENTER GLAZER MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. ITEM EIGHTEEN AB SEVENTEEN TWENTY NINE THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS LEYVA. LEYVA AYE WILK WILK I CHANGED WOULD ASAL LUNA SO I GLAZERS GLAZER AYE MCGUIRE PAN. BELIEVE THAT BELONG CALL THANK YOU VERY MUCH ALL RIGHT -- WE ARE GOING IN FILE ITEM ORDER -- DOCTOR WEBER SHE IS FILE ITEM TWELVE AB. FOURTEEN SIXTY BEGIN WHENEVER YOU'RE READY THANK YOU WELCOME GOOD MORNING AND TO MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS THE I'M HERE TODAY TO PRESENT TO YOU AB. FOURTEEN SIXTY THE C. ISSUE EDUCATES THE MOST ETHNICALLY DIVERSE STUDENT BODY IN THE NATION. AND THAT DIVERSITY SHOULD BE CELEBRATED BY INSTITUTIONALIZING A CURRICULUM THAT IS RELEVANT. INCLUSIVE AND REFLECTIVE OF THE STUDENT CULTURES AND BACKGROUNDS THEY SERVE. FIFTY YEARS AGO THE C. ISSUE BECAME THE BIRTHPLACE OF MODERN ETHNIC STUDIES. AND ALMOST ALL OF ITS CAMPUSES ALREADY MAINTAIN SOME LEVEL OF ETHNIC STUDIES ON THEM. ETHNIC STUDIES SCHOLARSHIP FOCUSES ON THE CENTRAL ROLE THAT RACE AND ETHNICITY PLAY. IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF AMERICAN HISTORY CULTURE AND SOCIETY. ETHNIC STUDIES FEELS IN THE THE KNOWLEDGE GAP AND CORRECT INTENTIONAL. MISREPRESENTATION OF PEOPLE OF COLOR. AND THEIR HISTORIES CONTRIBUTIONS AND EXPERIENCES. STUDIES HAVE FOUND THAT BOTH STUDENTS OF COLOR AND WHITE STUDENTS BENEFIT ACADEMICALLY AND SOCIALLY. FROM TAKING ETHNIC STUDIES COURSES. ETHNIC STUDIES COURSES CONTRIBUTE TO IMPROVE GRADUATION RATES POSITIVE CAMPUS CLIMATE OUTCOMES AND ARE VITAL TO A STUDENT SUCCESS BEYOND COLLEGE IN AN INCREASINGLY DIVERSE WORKFORCE AND SOCIETY. IN TWENTY FOURTEEN THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY CHANCES OFFICE LAUNCH THE TASK FORCE. ON THE ADVANCEMENT OF ETHNIC STUDIES COMPRISED OF FACULTY DEPARTMENT CHAIRS PROGRAM DIRECTORS COORDINATORS DEAN'S ACADEMIC SENATE CHEERS AND PRESIDENT'S THROUGHOUT THE CSU SYSTEM. IN TWENTY SIXTEEN THE NUMBER ONE RECOMMENDATION OF THAT TASK FORCE. THAT DOUBT FINAL REPORT WAS TO MAKE ETHNIC STUDIES A GENERAL EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS THROUGHOUT THE CSU SYSTEM. AB FOURTEEN SIXTY CODIFIES A NUMBER ONE RECOMMENDATION OF THE C. ISSUE TASK FORCE REPORT. AB FOURTEEN SIXTY WOULD HAVE THE CSU TAKE UP THE TORCH TO SYSTEMATICALLY LIVE UP TO ITS MISSION WHICH IS TO PREPARE STUDENTS FOR YOU INTERNATIONAL. MULTI CULTURAL SOCIETY. BY INCLUDING THE COMPLETION OF AN ETHNIC STUDIES COURSE AS A GRADUATION REQUIREMENT. AB FOURTEEN SIXTY IN SECTION TO SEE ANDY DIRECTS THE ACADEMIC SENATE TO WORK WITH THE CSU CHANCE COUNCIL ETHNIC STUDIES. TO DEVELOP AND IMPROVE AND APPROVE CORE COMPETENCIES TO BE ACHIEVED BY STUDENTS TAKING AN ETHNIC STUDIES COURSE. THIS MEANS FACULTY WOULD BE IN CHARGE L. OF AND WOULD DETERMINE WHAT COURSES COUNT TOWARD THAT WITH THIS REQUIREMENT. AND NOT THE LEGISLATURE. THIS BILL IS STRUCTURED IN A WAY THAT THE ETHNIC STUDIES REQUIREMENT MUST BE COMPLETE IMPLEMENTED WITHIN THE EXISTING NUMBER OF UNITS REQUIRED TO GRADUATE FROM THE UNIVERSITY. THEREFORE TIME TO DEGREE IS NOT IMPEDED ON IT EITHER. IN ADDITION AN ETHNIC STUDIES COURSE COULD EASILY DOUBLE COUNT FOR MULTIPLE REQUIREMENTS AND IF A STUDENT TOOK IN ETHNIC STUDIES COURSE AT A COMMUNITY COLLEGE. THE REQUIREMENT WOULD BE FULFILL. THIS BILL DOES NOT PRESCRIBED CURRICULUM COAST CONTENT OR STUDENT LEARNING OUTCOMES. NOR DOES THIS BILL LIMIT FACULTY MEMBERS A STUDENT'S ABILITY TO ENGAGE IN INTELLECTUAL DEBATE AT ALL. AND THEREFORE DOES NOT INFRINGE ON ACADEMIC FREEDOM. IT SHOULD ALSO BE NOTED THAT THE C. ISSUE ALREADY HAS COURSE REQUIREMENTS SUCH AS THE AMERICAN INSTITUTION REQUIREMENTS. THE FLEXIBILITY GIVEN IN THIS BILL ALLOWS FOR EASY IMPLEMENTATION FOR EACH INDIVIDUAL CAMPUS. DIFFERENT CAMPUSES HAVE DIFFERENT WAYS OF CREDITING CROSS LISTED COURSES. AS LONG AS OF COURSE HAS A CORE COMPETENCIES DETERMINED BY FACULTY. THEN THE REQUIREMENT WOULD BE FULFILL. LESLIE A. B. FOURTEEN CITY BUILT ON THE INTRODUCTORY KNOWLEDGE STUDENTS WILL RECEIVE AT THE SECONDARY COLLEGE LEVEL AND IT WILL MOST LIKELY BE CSU GRADUATES TEACHING ETHNIC STUDIES COURSES IN THE K. TO TWELVE LEVEL. I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THE FACT THAT THIS BILL IS SUPPORTED BY THE CALIFORNIA FACULTY ASSOCIATION. AND SUPPORTED BY A MULTITUDE OF CAMPUS DEPARTMENTS STUDENT ORGANIZATION CIVIL RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS AND LABOR GROUPS OUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I WON ALSO EMPHASIZE THE FACT THAT FOR FORTY YEARS I CHAIRED I'VE FOUND IT AND SHARED AT ADMINISTER THE ETHNIC STUDIES DEPARTMENT AFRICANA STUDIES DEPARTMENT AT SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY. ADDITIONALLY FOR SIX YEARS I CHEERED I WAS PRESIDENT OF THE NATIONAL COUNCIL FOR BLACK STUDIES THE NATIONAL ORGANIZATION OF ETHNIC STUDIES. AND SO I COULD BRING TO YOU A WEALTH OF EXPERIENCE AND UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THE UNIVERSITY WORKS. AND HOW IT DOESN'T WORK. AND THE THINGS THAT HAVE TO HAPPEN IN ORDER TO MOVE FORWARD. WITH ME TODAY TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF FOURTEEN SIXTY IS ROSS OUT. ROCKY -- RIVERA MARIE MARIE ALL BLACK OF WHO'S A RECENT CSU NORTHRIDGE CHICANO STUDIES GRADUATE. AND KENNETH MONTERO THE FORMER DEAN OF THE COLLEGE OF THE THE ONLY BECAUSE IT WE HAVE A ETHNIC STUDIES IN THE NATION BUT HE IS A FORMER DEAN OF THE COLLEGE OF ETHNIC STUDIES AT SAN FRANCISCO STATE UNIVERSITY.

FIVE YEARS LATER STUDENTS ARE FIGHTING THE SAME BATTLE TO PASS AB FOURTEEN SIXTY AND MAKE ETHNIC STUDIES A REQUIREMENT ACROSS THE TWENTY THREE CSU CAMPUSES. WITHOUT ETHNIC STUDIES I WOULD HAVE NOT GRADUATED WITH A RESEARCH ASSISTANTSHIP. PROVIDED THE OPPORTUNITY TO PUBLISHED IN A PEER REVIEWED JOURNAL PRESENTED OUT FIVE NATIONAL CONFERENCES AND ORGANIZE ALONGSIDE MY COMMUNITY. I AM ONE AMONG THOUSANDS OF STUDENTS TO TESTIFY ABOUT THE WAYS THE ETHNIC STUDIES CHANGE MY LIFE IN POSITIVE WAYS THAT I NEVER ANTICIPATED. IN FALL TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND FALL TWENTY EIGHTEEN FOR EXAMPLE THOUSANDS OF STUDENTS MOBILIZED WALKED OUT AND BOYCOTTED. AGAINST THE IMPLEMENTATION OF EXECUTIVE ORDERS ELEVEN HUNDRED AND ELEVEN HUNDRED ARE MANDATED BY CSU CHANCER TIMOTHY WHITE MEAT THEY'LL BLANCO. IN THE WAKE IN THE WAKE OF THE FIFTIETH YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF ETHNIC STUDIES STUDENTS IN THE CS YOU FIND IT EVEN MORE COMPELLING TO MAKE ETHNIC STUDIES A REQUIREMENT. ETHNIC STUDIES IS A POWERFUL AND INNOVATIVE INTERDISCIPLINARY FIELD THAT TACKLES ISSUES RANGING FROM IMMIGRATION ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE INCARCERATION LABOR GENDER RIGHTS AND SEXUALITY. IN WAYS THE TRADITIONAL DISCIPLINES SIMPLY CANNOT. UNDER TITLE FIVE MANDATE THE CSU IS ALREADY LEGALLY MANDATED TO TEACH AMERICAN INSTITUTIONS FOR EXAMPLE CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUES. TITLE FIVE DOES NOT MEET THE NEEDS OF STUDENTS WHO COME FROM HISTORICALLY DISENFRANCHISED BACKGROUNDS LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES AND FIRST GENERATION. I NOTHING STUDIES REQUIREMENT IN THE CSU ABROAD IN THE CURRICULUM TO EMPOWER FACULTY AND STUDENTS TO MAKE CURRICULUM DECISIONS THAT ARE INNOVATIVE GROUNDBREAKING AND TRANSFORMATIVE SO THAT STUDENTS CAN SUCCEED IN THE CSU SYSTEM. AB FOURTEEN SIXTY IS NEEDED TO PROTECT THE RIGHT FOR ETHNIC STUDIES TO EXIST. IN FALL TWENTY SEVENTEEN CSU PRESIDENT DIANNE HARRISON PROMISED TO MAKE ETHNIC STUDIES A REQUIREMENT ACROSS THE CSU. CLOSED DOORS ADMINISTRATORS LIE ABOUT THEIR SUPPORT FOR ETHNIC STUDIES HOWEVER ADMINISTRATORS RARELY TAKE THE RISK OF A HOLDING THE INTEGRITY THAT ETHNIC STUDIES. DESERVES. THIS IS THE ONLY FIELD OF KNOWLEDGE THAT WAS CREATED BY COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND ACTIVISTS. I RESPECTFULLY ASK ALL OF YOU TO PLEASE VOTE IN FAVOR OF AB FOURTEEN SIXTY AND THE ENTRANCE OF EDUCATIONAL EQUITY. DIVERSE CITY AND CALIFORNIA'S FUTURE THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS. LEYVA AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS I'M COULD PROFESSOR KENNETH MONTERO LEAD OFFICE OF OVER TWO HUNDRED MEMBERS OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY AT THE STUDIES COUNCIL. AND CHOSEN BY THE CALIFORNIA FACULTY ASSOCIATIONS BECOME THEIR BEHALF AS WELL SO I THINK EVERY TIME HARD WORKING ENCOURAGE YOUR SUPPORT FOR THIS POTENTIALLY HISTORIC LEGISLATION. FOR BREVITY WILL HIGHLIGHT TWO THEMES FIRST ONLY A COUPLE SELECT EXAMPLES. FOR TENS SECOND SELECT A COUPLE OF MYTH IN OPPOSITION. ARGUMENT FIRST IT IS UNTHINKABLE THAT IN EDUCATION EDUCATED PERSON IN THE MULTI ETHNIC MULTICULTURAL GLOBAL. GLOBAL CONNECTED TWENTY FIRST CENTURY ONLY STUDIES ONE INTELLECTUAL AND CULTURAL TRADITION THE UNIVERSITY. EPIC STUDIES PROVIDE THAT ADDED VALUE [inaudible] TO AS MENTIONED EARLIER STRUGGLE CHAU QUICKLY ON IT RESEARCH DEMONSTRATES NUMEROUS ADDITIONAL VALUES FOR ETHNIC STUDIES INCLUDING AND UP 220% INCREASE IN GRADUATION RATES FOR COLLEGE STUDENTS TO SUCCEED. IN AT LEAST ONE COURSE NO MATTER THE MAJOR YES THAT'S A 20% INCREASE AND ANY MAJOR SITES BUSINESS. MYTH ONE AB ONE OF ONE FOUR SIX OO IS DESCRIBED AS UNPRECEDENTED IN VIOLATES PRINCIPLES OF SHARED GOVERNANCE AND ACADEMIC FREEDOM. SHARED GOVERNANCE IS BESTOWED BY THIS AUGUST BODY AND THE LEGISLATURE JUDICIOUSLY. ALREADY REGULATES GENERAL EDUCATION OF THE GRADUATION REQUIREMENTS AS APPROPRIATE AND NECESSARY PROFESSES NO ECONOMIC FREEDOM IS NOT ACADEMIC LICENSE WE ARE FREE TO EXPRESS HOW WE TEACH WITH AN ESTABLISHED PROFESSIONAL PARAMETERS. SET BY LEGISLATURE THIS BILL SIMPLY REQUIRES THAT WE OFFER THIS FACULTY CREATED CURRICULUM WITH PROVEN ACADEMIC BENEFIT TO ALL AS RECOMMENDED IN THE CSU CHANCES BLUE RIBBON TASK FORCE SEVERAL YEARS AGO. MYTH TO THOUGH CUSTOMARILY THEY WOULD ADMINISTRATIVE LEADERSHIP DID NOT CONSULT THE ETHNIC STUDIES FACULTY BEFORE SPEAKING ON OUR BEHALF REGARDING ACADEMIC FREEDOM OF SHARED GOVERNANCE OR ON THE RECENT CURRICULA EXECUTIVE. ORDERS AND MATH THREE BY -- AS INDICATED BY JOINT LETTER SUBMITTED BY ETHNIC STUDIES AND WOMEN'S STUDIES DEPARTMENT SHOES JOINTLY IF YOU TO CLAIM THAT THIS BILL WOULD. ETHNIC STUDIES AGAINST OUR COLLEAGUES TO THE CONTRARY THE SUPPORTED. SO I ENCOURAGE YOU TO CORRECT THE DECISION FIFTY YEARS AGO WHEN THE GOVERNOR LEGISLATOR AND SEE ISSUE LEADERSHIP SECURE THEIR PERMANENT PLACE ON THE WRONG SIDE OF HISTORY. AND TO TAKE AN IMPORTANT STEP TOWARDS INVITING ALL PARTIES TO THE CORRECT SIDE OF HISTORY SHAPING A BETTER FUTURE FOR ALL WE APPRECIATE YOUR TIME ON THIS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WITNESSES IN SUPPORT.

THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. SEEING NONE IS THERE ANY OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. COME ON UP THEIR SEATS AT THE TABLE. TWO WITNESSES TWO MINUTES EACH BEGIN WHEN YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. MY NAME IS KATHERINE NELSON I'M CHAIR OF THE ACADEMIC SENATE OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE WITH YOU THIS MORNING. WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE AB. FOURTEEN SIXTY THE ACADEMIC SENATE CSU IS THE INSTITUTIONALLY AND LEGALLY RECOGNIZED VOICE OF THE CSU FACULTY IN MATTERS OF SYSTEM WIDE ACADEMIC CONCERNS. INCLUDING CURRICULUM AND GRADUATION REQUIREMENTS. YOU'VE HEARD A VERY POWERFUL CASE FOR THE IMPACT OF ETHNIC STUDIES ON OUR STUDENTS. CASE WITH WHICH WE AGREE HOWEVER WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT A LEGISLATIVELY MANDATED GRADUATION REQUIREMENT IS AN APPROPRIATE MEANS. OF ACCOMPLISHING THE ENDS EMBODIED IN THE LEGISLATION. FACULTY HAVE THE EXPERTISE AND EXPERIENCE TO JUDGE THE APPROPRIATE REQUIREMENTS FOR A UNIVERSITY DEGREE. LEGISLATIVE INVOLVEMENT SUBSTITUTES THE GOVERNMENT'S AGENDA FOR THAT EXPERTISE AS THE BASIS FOR CURRICULAR DECISIONS. THE POTENTIAL RIPPLE EFFECTS OF THE BILL DESERVE CONSIDERATION AS WELL. GIVEN THE C. ISSUES HUNDRED AND TWENTY UNIT LIMIT ON UNDERGRADUATE DEGREES THE ADDITIONAL THREE UNIT GRADUATION REQUIREMENT HAS THE POTENTIAL. TO ALTERNATE MAJOR REQUIREMENTS ESPECIALLY IN HIGH UNIT MAJORS ALREADY PRESSED TO MEET ACCREDITATION AND GENERAL EDUCATION. REQUIREMENTS SIMULTANEOUSLY. IN ADDITION THE WAY THE REQUIREMENT IS CONSTRUCTED. POSES POTENTIAL CHALLENGES FOR THE NUMBER OF OPTIONS STUDENTS HAVE FOR SATISFYING GENERAL EDUCATION CULTURAL STUDIES REQUIREMENTS AND FOR DOUBLE COUNTING IN MAJORS AND MINORS. THAT INVOLVE COURSES FROM THE MULTIPLE ETHNIC STUDIES DEPARTMENTS. THE START DATE OF FALL TWO THAT DIED TWENTY TWENTY IS ALSO INSUFFICIENT TIME TO PREPARE FOR IMPLEMENTATION. CSU COMMUNITY COLLEGE ARTICULATION AGREEMENTS LEARNING OUTCOMES COURSE CERTIFICATION AND CHANGES IN ACADEMIC PROGRAMS ALL NEED TO BE THOROUGHLY VETTED THROUGH APPROPRIATE CURRICULUM REVIEW PROCESS SEES. AND BECAUSE THE BILL CREATES AN UNFUNDED MANDATE REDUCTIONS IN OTHER PROGRAMS MAY BE NECESSARY TO SORT THE BECAUSE OF IMPLEMENTATION. THIS COMMITTEE HAS A POLICY REGARDING BILLS RELATING TO CURRICULUM FRAMEWORKS AND MODEL CURRICULA THAT STATES THAT SUCH MEASURE SHOULD BE INTRODUCED ONLY A MINUTE AFTER REMEMBER HAS TRIED UNSUCCESSFULLY TO USE ADMINISTRATIVE ROUTES. TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE. A PARALLEL EXISTS. IN THIS CASE AS WELL. ANY PROPOSAL FOR SYSTEM MY GRADUATION REQUIREMENTS SHOULD BE VETTED THROUGH ESTABLISHED CSU SHARED GOVERNANCE PROCESSES. OUR RESOLUTION AS THREE THREE EIGHT ZERO CREATES THAT ALTERNATIVE BY PROVIDING JUST SUCH A SHARED GOVERNMENT GOVERNANCE MECHANISM TO RECOMMEND CSU ETHNIC STUDIES CURRICULUM BASED ON THE ETHNIC STUDIES TASK FORCE REPORT. WE APPRECIATE THE INCREASED FLEXIBILITY IN THE BILL RESULTING FROM CLARIFICATION FROM MEMBER WEBBER'S OFFICE ABOUT WHICH COURSES SATISFY THE REQUIREMENT AND THE AMENDMENT THAT ESTABLISHES A MINIMUM THREE UNIT REQUIREMENTS. WE ALSO ARE VERY MUCH AWARE OF THE HISTORY OF RACIALIZATION OF THE PRINCIPLES OF ACADEMIC FREEDOM AND FACULTY CONTROL OF THE CURRICULUM. AS MUCH AS WE APPRECIATE THESE DEVELOPMENTS WE REMAIN OPPOSED TO THE BILL. THE USE OF GOVERNMENT POWER TO MANDATE CURRICULUM IS QUITE FRANKLY CHILLING NO MATTER HOW WORTHY THE GOAL. IF AB SIXTY FOURTEEN SIXTY BECOMES LAW IT WOULD SET A PRECEDENT FOR FUTURE CURRICULAR MANDATES TO BE IMPOSED BY THE LEGISLATURE. SO WE URGE YOU TO SERIOUSLY CONSIDER THE LONG TERM IMPLICATIONS OF THE VOTE YOU ARE ABOUT TO TAKE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS. GOOD MORNING I'M LAUREN BLANCHARD I SERVE AS EXECUTIVE VICE CHANCELLOR FOR ACADEMIC AND STUDENT AFFAIRS FOR THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. TODAY I I JOIN MY COLLEAGUE CATHERINE NELSON IN OPPOSING ASSEMBLY BILL FOURTEEN SIXTY WHICH WOULD IN IN POLLS THE COMPLETION OF A THREE UNIT ETHNIC STUDIES COURSES A GRADUATION REQUIREMENT. FOR ALL STUDENTS. LET ME BE CLEAR THAT OUR CONCERNS REST NOT WITH THE VALUE DERIVED IN BRINGING GREATER AWARENESS AND UNDERSTANDING OF THE HISTORICAL AND CONTEMPORARY EXPERIENCES. OF ETHNIC GROUPS IN OUR IN OUR COUNTRY WE FULLY UNDERSTAND THE ETHNIC AND RACIAL TENSIONS AND INTOLERANCE THAT HAVE BEEN AND EVEN TODAY ARE STILL TOO PERVASIVE. IN AMERICAN SOCIETIES WE ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY IS THE BIRTHPLACE OF ETHNIC STUDIES FIRST ESTABLISHED AT SAN FRANCISCO STATE UNIVERSITY IN. NINETEEN SIXTY NINE AND AS A RESULT OF THE ETHNIC STUDIES TASK FORCE RECOMMENDATION A TASK FORCE THAT WAS COMMISSIONED BY CHANCE WERE WHITE. FOR YEARS TO GROW AGO WE HAVE NOW SEEN FIRST A 9% INCREASE IN ENROLLMENT IN ETHNIC STUDIES COURSES. THE ISSUE IS HIRED OVER SEVENTY SEVENTY TWO FACULTY MEMBERS STUDENT TENURE TRACK IN ETHNIC STUDIES. AND WE NOW HAVE 47% OF OUR CSU GRADUATES COMPLETING AND ETHNIC STUDIES COURSE IN ONE OF THE FOUR COURSE AREAS PRESCRIBED IN THE BILL. LASTLY THE CSU CHANCELLOR WHITE HAS MADE PROGRESS. IN MAKING SURE THAT THE ETHNIC STUDIES TASK FORCE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE BEING FOR FIELD AND HAS MADE A PART OF HIS ANNUAL EVALUATION PROCESS WITH THE PRESIDENT'S. THE ISSUE IS THE MOST ETHNICALLY ECONOMICALLY AND ACADEMICALLY DIVERSE STUDENT BODY IN THE UNITED STATES. PART OF THE C. ISSUES MISSION IS TO PREPARE STUDENTS TO LIVE AND TO WORK IN A CULTURALLY DIVERSE SOCIETY. AND THIS MISSION IS TAKEN VERY SERIOUSLY BY THE CSU WE STRONGLY SUPPORT ETHNIC STUDIES COURSES AND PROGRAMS IN THE CSU. HOWEVER AS WAS JUST MENTIONED BY DOCTOR NELSON THIS BILL WOULD REPRESENT AN UNPRECEDENTED LEGISLATIVELY DICTATED CURRICULAR REQUIREMENT. THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE HAS NEVER IMPOSED COURSE REQUIREMENTS FOR CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY STUDENTS BEFORE. THE BILL UNDERMINES THE PROCESS OF SHARED GOVERNANCE AND ACADEMIC FREEDOM SUCH A MANDATE WILL SET THE DANGEROUS PRECEDENT OF ALLOWING GOVERNMENTS TO DETERMINE CURRICULAR AND THREATENS THE ACADEMIC FREEDOM. INHERENT IN COLLEGIATE EDUCATION CSU FACULTY ARE HIRED FOR THEIR DISCIPLINARY EXPERTISE. THEY SHOULD BE RELIED ON TO DEVELOP CURRICULAR THAT ARE RESPONSIVE TO LOCAL COMMUNITIES YOU'RE OUT OF TIME SO IF YOU CAN WRAP IT UP PLEASE. SECONDLY THIS BILL RUNS CONTRARY TO THE WORK OF THE CSU WELL AS POINT LARGELY DRIVEN BY THE FACULTY TO FOCUS MORE ON INCLUSIVE EXCELLENCE. AND IMPLEMENT STRATEGIES THERE WITHIN TO ADDRESS ACT EQUITY IN OPPORTUNITY GAPS OF ALL EFFORT UNDER REPRESENTED STUDENTS ARE ARE DISENFRANCHISED STUDENTS THAT WE SERVE. SO UNLIKE THE RESTRICTIVE LANGUAGE OF LANGUAGE IN A. B. FOURTEEN SIXTY WHICH LIMITS US TO FOUR DISCIPLINES OUR CAMPUS IS REALLY HAVE INCLUDED A MORE INCLUSIVE RANGE OF PERSPECTIVES. INCLUDING WOMEN'S STUDIES GENDER STUDIES RELIGIOUS STUDIES LGBT Q. STUDIES WHICH THIS BILL WOULD THEN ISOLATE THOSE PARTICULAR COURSE. THANK YOU ANY OTHER MET ANY OTHER -- OPPOSITION TO THE BILL SIR. HI DAVE SPEAKING I'M STILL THE PROUD PARENT OF THREE WOMEN OF COLOR BEAUTIFUL WOMEN OF COLOR I'M ALSO FOUR TIMES OF THE CHAIR OF THE ECONOMIC SENATE CAL POLY POMONA. AND I AM CURRENTLY CHAIR OF THE FISCAL AND GOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS COMMITTEE OF THE SYSTEM MIGHT SENATE BA A CSU. AND I STRONGLY OPPOSE THE BILL THANK OU SIR ANY OTHER OPPOSITION SEEING AND HEARING THEN WE'LL COME BACK TO THE COMMITTEE SENATOR ALSO. YES -- THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO THE AUTHOR -- I AM. VERY PROUD OF YOU. VERY PROUD OF AS A WOMAN OF COLOR THAT YOU ARE MOVING THIS FORWARD AND THAT YOU WON'T GIVE UP ON IT. I AM VERY EMBARRASSED. THAT FORTY FIVE YEARS AGO WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE. THAT I'M HEARING SIMILAR EXPLANATION SIMILAR EXCUSES. FOR NOT DOING WHAT THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM OF THE STATE AND THIS NATION SHOULD HAVE DONE. WORDS LIKE HOWEVER NOT NOW I'LL NEVER BEFORE -- THREATENS ACADEMIC FREEDOM SHOULD DO THIS SHOULD DO THAT. FORTY FIVE YEARS AFTER I WAS IN COLLEGE. WHAT IN THE BAREST MOMENT? WHAT AN EMBARRASSMENT? I EXPECT A WHOLE LOT MORE FROM OUR EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM IN THIS STATE. AND TO THINK THAT WE ARE STILL. AT OUR AGE STILL FIGHTING FOR THE RECOGNITION OF STUDIES THAT SHOULDN'T BE SEEN AS SOMETHING THAT SEGREGATED AWAY FROM THE REST OF OUR EDUCATION. BUT SHOULD BE SEEN AS SOMETHING SO INTEGRAL FILL HEALTHY FOR EVERYBODY -- I'M I'M JUST SO SHOCKED. OF I NEVER THOUGHT THAT AT THIS POINT IN MY LIFE. THAT THIS WOULD EVEN BE A CONVERSATION OR A DEBATE -- AND THERE ARE LOTS OF EXCUSES THAT ARE DRUMMED UP. TO KEEP OUT OUR PART OF HISTORY OUR PART OF WHAT. ALL PEOPLE DO ANNA -- AT I JUST THE IT'S QUITE. A SURPRISE TO ME SO. I AM A STRONG SUPPORTER -- AND I GREATLY APPRECIATE YOUR CONTINUED LEADERSHIP AND I WOULD EXPECT. NOTHING LESS THAN. THIS FOR ALL. THE YOUTH ALL THE STUDENTS WHO ATTEND OUR HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS THANK YOU AND I WILL BE PROUD TO MOVE THE BILL. THANK YOU CENTER DORADO CENTER GLAZER -- THANK YOU. A DOCTOR WEBER YOU ARE TRULY A TRAILBLAZER IN THIS AREA -- AT YOUR LEADERSHIP AND AT EIGHT EIGHT I'M A OBSERVER DID BEGAN AT THE BEGINNING OF YOUR PROFESSIONAL LIFE BECAUSE YOU HAVEN'T REALLY DEVIATED FROM THAT ALL THE THINGS THAT YOU HAVE DONE AND AND LET ON AND TAUGHT. AND OF COURSE I WE SHARE SOME HISTORY TOGETHER I WENT TO SAN DIEGO STATE AND I A IT WASN'T A REQUIREMENT THAT AND THAT I TOK AT AN ATTIC STUDIES COURSE IN MEXICAN AMERICAN STUDIES -- I BRIEFLY ENROLLED IN -- DOCTOR KARENGA ITS COURSE -- UNTIL MY WORKLOAD GOT SO GREAT THAT I COULDN'T CONTINUE BUT AND I TOOK WITHIN STUDIES AND I THESE ROLE CHOICES THAT I GOT TO MAKE AND I WAS VERY MUCH IN RICH BY IT. NO DOUBT ABOUT IT -- AND I AS YOU I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WERE HERE DURING THE EARLIER CONVERSATION ON ASSEMBLY MEMBER MEDINA IS BILL HEARD ON TELEVISION VERY GOOD THEN YOU KNOW MY SENTIMENTS ABOUT HOW IMPORTANT IT IS THAT. THAT WE TEACH. OUR ALL OF OUR CITIZENS ABOUT EACH OTHER AND OUR BACKGROUNDS IN OUR CULTURE. THAT THAT REALLY IS SO IMPORTANT TO OUR COHESION AS A AS A AS A WORLD AND THERE'S NO DOUBT NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT. THE ISSUE I HAVE WITH YOUR BILL AS I HAD WITH HIS IS THIS ISSUE OF A MANDATE. ADDED THE REQUIREMENT THAT WE SHOULD GET IN THE WAY OF THOUGHT. I'D IN THE CASE OF THE MEDINA BILL THE BOARD OF EDUCATION AND THE SCHOOL BOARDS IN THE CASE OF YOUR BILL. THE ACADEMIC SENATE'S ON THE CAMPUSES AND IN MANDATING A SPECIFIC ACTIVITY EVEN IF IT'S ONE I THINK I VERY WORTHY. OF STUDY -- AND ENGAGEMENT. NOW ACCORDING TO THE ANALYSIS THE THE CHANCELLOR ISSUED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN IT DIDN'T MANDATE -- THE COURSE REQUIREMENT BUT AT SUGGESTED. AND SO I GUESS I'M INTERESTED IN HEARING. WHERE WHERE IS IT THAT I BECAUSE I'M TRYING TO ESTABLISH THIS HIGH BAR THAT WE NEED TO STEP IN -- CAN YOU SPEAK TO THE WORK THAT THE ACADEMIC SENATE'S OF DINO THEY'VE NOT EVEN CONSIDER THIS ISSUE HAVE THEY TURNED IT DOWN. HAD THERE NOT BEEN A CAMPUSES THAT HAVE ADOPTED THIS IS A PART OF THEIR CAMPUS CHOICE COULD YOU CAN YOU SPEAK TO THAT ISSUE. WHAT I THINK -- YOU KNOW IF YOU LOOK AT IT IN TERMS OF THAT RECOMMENDATION AND THAT'S NOT THE FIRST TIME IT'S EVER BEEN RECOMMENDED IT'S BEEN RECOMMENDED BEFORE. FROM VARIOUS OTHER AREAS IN TERMS OF ALL PERSONS CONCERNED AND LEADERSHIP AREAS -- IT HAS NOT BEEN TAKEN UP AS A STATEWIDE INITIATIVE -- THE RECOMMENDATIONS BEEN THERE BUT THERE IS NO PLAN IN PLACE THAT I KNOW OF WHERE THEY HAVE SYSTEMATICALLY DECIDED HOW THEY WOULD ROLL THIS OUT OVER THE OVER THAN A NUMBER OF YEARS. SO THE RECOMMENDATION IS THERE BUT IT IS NOT BEEN TAKEN UP TO BASICALLY BE IMPLEMENTED. THOSE DEPARTMENTS WHO HAVE -- AND I'M SEVERAL DEPARTMENTS HAVE CONTACTED US WHO HAVE TAKEN THAT INITIATIVE AND HAVE TRIED TO PUSH IT A LITTLE BIT MORE ON THEIR CAMPUSES HAVE MET RESISTANCE OF COURSE -- A FEW HAVE BEEN ABLE -- TO WHO ALREADY HAVE IN PLACE A STRUCTURE THAT ALLOWS IT TO HAPPEN TO HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO SOMETHING WITH IT -- BUT IT HAS NOT BEEN COME A MAJOR ISSUE STATEWIDE THAT WE CAN EMBRACE AND SAY OKAY THEY'VE TAKEN THE RECOMMENDATION IN A MOVING FORWARD WITH IT -- IT'S NOT THE YEAR AND SO -- SO YOU DON'T HAVE A PLAN THAT'S BEING LAID OUT BY THE THE ACADEMIC SENATE -- TO IMPLEMENT THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL. SO I I KNOW YOU'RE SPEAKING ABOUT THE STATE WIDE I THINK YOU'RE SPEAKING ABOUT THE STATEWIDE ACADEMIC. BUT I'M REALLY INTERESTED IN THE CAMPUS BY CAMPUS CHOICE SO OTHER WORDS. I HEAR THAT ALREADY WHO'VE ALWAYS DONE THAT WHO'S ALWAYS HAD ETHNIC STUDIES OR I SHOULD SAY A MULTI CULTURAL STUDIES COMPONENT WHICH IS DIFFERENT THAN AN ETHNIC STUDIES COMPONENT. ALL AND AND IT SAID IT WILL STATE WE HAD A MULTI CULTURAL REQUIREMENT THAT WAS THE ACOSTA CULTURE WHATEVER IT WAS. AND IT COULD BE SATISFIED IN A MULTITUDE OF WAYS THAT WOULD NEVER CAUSE THEM TO EVER ADDRESS THE ISSUES OF PEOPLE OF COLOR IN CALIFORNIA -- WE COULD YOU COULD TAKE IT BY STUDYING SOUTHERN EUROPEANS OR WHATEVER YOU WANTED THAT THAT HAVE SOME DIVERSITY COMPONENT BUT ABILITY TO ACTUALLY DEAL WITH THE ISSUES OF OF RACE AND AND AND AND ETHNICITY IN CALIFORNIA IN THE UNITED STATES AND THE ISSUE THAT IT. IMPACTS THEIR LIVES DALY OF THAT WAS NOT YOU COULD GET A WAY YOU COULD GET OUT OF THE UNIVERSITY WITHOUT EVER TECH TAKING THAT SUBJECT MATTER. AND AND THAT IS ONE OF THE CONCERNS THAT IF WE'RE GOING TO REALLY ADDRESS THE ISSUES THAT WE FACE EVERY DAY. THAT WE SEE EVERYDAY IN OUR CLASSROOMS AND ARE IN IN THE PLACES WHERE WE LIVE YOU HAVE TO BEGIN TO BASICALLY CRACKED OPEN THAT IT CAN BEGIN TO ENGAGE IN THAT CONVERSATION. AND NOT NOT DIVERT YOUR INTEREST IN OTHER AREAS AND SAY ALWAYS SATISFIED BECAUSE WE TOOK A COURSE IN. SOME SOME OTHER COUNTRY SOMEWHERE ELSE WITHOUT ACTUALLY TOUCHING THE CALIPHATE THE YELLOW CALIFORNIA OR THE OR THE USE UNITED STATES ISSUES. RIGHT BUT MY QUESTION REALLY IS TRYING TO ADDRESS. I THE COMPELLING NEED FOR US TO ACT AS A LEGISLATURE WE CAN BECAUSE WE WE JUST MADE TO MEET THEM IS FINISHED -- BECAUSE OF AN ABSENCE OF ACTIONS ON THE CAMPUS IS TO SHOW THAT SENSITIVITY AND IN SOME CASES TO ADOPT THAT AS A REQUIREMENT IN GENERAL EDUCATION. AND THAT FOR ME AT LEAST IT'S LIKE WE'VE TWENTY THREE CAMPUSES WE HAVE SHARED GOVERNANCE ON EACH WITH ACADEMIC SENATE'S ON EACH. AND SO FOR ME TO TRY TO GET TO THIS HIGHER BAR -- AND PRATT PRECEDENT SETTING BAR. I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND -- WHETHER IT SINCE THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN EXECUTIVE ORDER BY THE CHANCELLOR HAVE WE HAD CAMPUS IS THAT HAVE DONE NOTHING AND ACTUALLY REFUSED TO ACT AND SAID THAT IT'S ON THE RECORD THEY HAD TO DELIVER TO PROCESS THEY SAID NO WE AT CAMPUSES THAT HAVE SAID YES. AND WATER EVERYBODY IN BETWEEN I WAS I'VE I'M LOOKING FOR SOME FACTUAL BASIS TO UNDERSTAND THE NEED TO ACT TODAY. FACT THAT YOU HAVE FIFTY YEARS OF ETHNIC STUDIES. AND AND THAT FIFTY YEARS IS NOT FIFTY YEARS OF IDLE ACTIVITY. YOU KNOW HAVING BEEN A CHAIR OF ETHNIC STUDIES FOR ALMOST FORTY YEARS THIRTY OF THE FORTY YEARS I WAS THERE -- THERE IS PERSISTENT AND CONSISTENT DISCUSSIONS OF ETHNIC STUDIES ON THOSE CAMPUSES AND INCLUSION OF THOSE COURSES IN THE REGULAR COULD NOT ONLY JUST IN THE REGULAR CURRICULUM THE CONTENT. BUT ALSO THE REQUIREMENTS TO HAVE STUDENTS TAKE THOSE CLASSES THAT IS A CONSTANTLY THAT IS THERE ON ALL THE CAMPUS AND IT ALWAYS HAS BEEN. AND AFTER FIFTY YEARS OF THAT WHEN I CAME TO THE LEGISLATURE AUTHORED THE FIRST PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT WAS A A RESOLUTION CONCERNING ETHNIC STUDIES. AND OUT OF THAT RESOLUTION WE HAD A HEARING APPEAR OUT OF THE RESOLUTION THE CHANCELLOR THE AND WHO CAME IN WHITE CAME IN AND THE BLACK CAUCUS AND SOME OTHER CAUCUSES MET WITH HIM AND SAYS THIS IS A A AN ISSUE THAT WE HAVE THE NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED. SO OUT OF ALL OF THAT THEN YOU GET THIS COMMISSION THIS SERVICE FOR A COUPLE YEARS THAT'S PRESIDENT'S IN FACULTY MEMBERS AND YOU NAME IT ALL THE COLLABORATIONS IS THERE. AND IT COMES OUT WITH A RECOMMENDATION TO SAY AS ONE OF THE NUMBER ONE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE A THREE UNIT REQUIREMENT OF ETHNIC STUDIES THROUGHOUT THE SYSTEM. NOW THIS IS AS A RESULT THIS IS WHAT I'M THIS IS MY SEVENTH YEAR HERE. SO THIS IS A RESULT OF SEVEN YEARS OF DISCUSSION AN ONGOING AND WE STILL DON'T HAVE THAT WE HAVE CONTINUING CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT SOME DEPARTMENTS HAVE DONE. HOW THEY'VE TAKEN SOME HAVE DONE THAT BUT THEY'VE BEEN DOING THEY HAD BEEN DOING THAT ALL ALONG SO YOU DON'T HAVE THE INTRODUCTION OF THIS NEW -- A STATEWIDE MOVEMENT SO. THE ISSUE IS YES THE URGENCY IS THERE. TO THE EXTENT THAT HOW LONG AND AND HOPEFULLY AS KINGS IS NOT LONG. HOW LONG DO YOU HAVE TO WAIT FOR THIS TO HAPPEN IS FIFTY YEARS ENOUGH? OF IT OR DO WE KNOW ENOUGH INFORMATION ABOUT ETHNIC STUDIES TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE YOU KNOW ALL WE THE PEOPLE IN THIS GENERATION DETERMINED TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN. IS THIS LEGISLATURE DIVERSE ENOUGH TO BEGIN TO SEE THE NECESSITY OF IT -- AND I AND I SAY THIS BECAUSE THIS IS MY BATTLE FOR FIFTY YEARS I BECAME THE UNIVERSITY IN NINETEEN SEVENTY TWO TO DEVELOP ETHNIC STUDIES A CYNICAL STATE. SO I'VE BEEN IN THIS A LONG TIME I'VE HEARD ALL OF THESE. CONVERSATIONS I HAVE BEEN A PART OF THE ACADEMIC SENATE FOR SIXTY YEARS OUR SERVICE AQABA SENATE I SERVICE CHAIR OF THE CAMPUS CURRICULUM COMMITTEE FOR THE SENATE FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS. I KNOW ALL THE DIFFICULTY AND THE AND THE RESISTANCE THAT SEVERE I'VE BEEN IN THE IVORY TOWER AND TRY TO PAINT MULTIPLE COLORS AND IT HAS NOT WORKED. SO ALL I'M SAYING IS THAT. WHAT ELSE DO YOU NEED TO KNOW? WELL ENDING IN A SITUATION WHERE YOU YOU OF THE BIRTH PLACE OF ETHNIC STUDIES FOR FIFTY YEARS. I MEAN WHAT ELSE DO WE NEED TO KNOW TELL ME AND AND TELL ME HOW YOU WOULD DO IT I AND I KNOW I'M NOT POLLS BECAUSE THEN YOU BUT THAT'S OKAY I'M SORRY. BUT IT IT BEFORE BEFORE YOU RESPOND CENTER GLAZER IF I COULD JUST ASK THE AUDIENCE WHEN YOU LIKE SOMETHING WE GO LIKE THIS IF YOU DON'T LIKE SOMETHING WE JUST STAY SILENT. SO I I LOVE YOUR PASSION AND I I AND I LOVE YOUR HISTORY AND CERTAINLY THERE'S FEW THEY CAN SPEAK TO THAT UNDERSTANDING HISTORY IS SOMEONE LIKE YOU -- WITH ALL THAT YOU HAVE DONE. THE THE SYSTEMS HAVE COME AT THE SYSTEM IS COMING IN SAID THAT SINCE THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN EXECUTIVE ORDER THAT. THERE'S BEEN A 9% INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS TAKING -- ETHNIC STUDIES AND THEY PROFESS TO SAY AND I I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE INFORMATION TO THE COUNTRY THAT THEY'VE HIRED. SEVENTY TWO S. ETHNIC STUDIES TENURE TRACK FACULTY WHICH IS A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF FACULTY SO THEY'RE READY NOT TO IMPLEMENT THE STATE WIDE INITIATIVE SO IT'S AN EIGHT AND I THINK THAT IF YOU IF YOU I I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN SPEAK TO THE EVIDENCE THAT THAT THE COURSE. CATALOG HAS BEEN SHRUNK IN TERMS OF ETHNIC STUDIES THE MAJORS HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED DEPARTMENTS HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED. ANYWAY I I'M STILL TRYING TO GET TO THIS ISSUE OF THE COMPELLING NEED AYE AYE DEAL IS AND IT ISN'T IT ISN'T OUT OF A GREAT. APPRECIATION FOR THE GOALS THAT YOU HAVE ESTABLISHED OKAY AND HIS LAST THING AND AND AND THAT. IF YOU WANT TO DRESS YOU CAN BUT LOOK. THERE IS AN EVAN FLOW TO OUR POLITICAL SYSTEM -- THAT -- IS SOMETIMES COMFORTABLE DO OBSERVE -- BECAUSE WE OBVIOUSLY WOULD LIKE IT TO BE THE WHERE IS TODAY RIGHT. AND IN PREVIOUS LEGISLATURE'S THERE'VE BEEN PEOPLE IN CHARGE THAT HAVEN'T BEEN LIKE YOU ARE LIKE ME -- AND THEY DON'T HAVE TO GO TOO FAR BACK AND SO. YET THERE IS A POTENTIAL IN THE FUTURE EVEN THOUGH WE WOULDN'T EXPECT OR HOPE FOR IS. THAT THE FOLKS THAT ARE UP HERE AT THE DAIS -- ARE GONNA BE AT FOLKS WITH A DIFFERENT PHILOSOPHY PHILOSOPHICAL VIEW ABOUT OUR CAMPUSES IN ACADEMIC FREEDOM AND THE CHOICES THAT -- MAYBE THEY WANT TO MAKE ABOUT -- MANDATES THAT THEY WANT TO REQUIRE WE HAVE NEVER PROVIDED THIS TYPE OF A MANDATE BEFORE IT IS AN BY WORRY A SLIPPERY SLOPE. IN TERMS OF WHAT WOULD COME NEXT I'M NOT BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF MERIT BUT BECAUSE OF WE HAVE A PROCESS IN PLACE WE HAVE A BOARD OF TRUSTEES WHICH IS A VERY DIVERSE BOARD OF TRUSTEES. WE HAVE CAMPUS LEADERSHIP WITH GREAT DIVERSITY NOW UNPRECEDENTED. MORE THAN HALF OF THE UNIVERSITY PRESIDENTS ARE WOMEN TODAY AT THE CSU. HAVE A LOT MORE WORK TO DO ON DIVERSITY WITHIN OUR FACULTY AND I KNOW THAT'S AN ONGOING CHALLENGE. IT WAS I WAS HEARTENING TO HEAR EARLIER IN TESTIMONY THAT AS A PART OF THE PRESIDENTIAL REVIEW THAT THIS ISSUE IS A PART OF THOSE STANDARDS AND I KNOW I SAID AS A TRUSTEE DURING THOSE REVIEWS. AND THOSE THINGS ARE TAKEN VERY SERIOUSLY IN TERMS OF THE LEADERSHIP OF THE CAMPUS. IN THESE TYPES OF AREAS. AND SO I JUST WANT TO INSURE THAT THAT OBSERVATION THAT AS MUCH AS THESE ARE THINGS WE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE I CERTAINLY WOULD LIKE TO SEE IT. TOO THERE IS A VERY SLIPPERY SLOPE WE GET ON WITH THESE TYPES OF MANDATES AND AGAIN THAT'S NOT OUT OF ANY COULD. LIMIT OF THE REST OF THE ENORMOUS RESPECT I HAVE FOR YOU AND YOUR LEADERSHIP AND I THANK YOU FOR INDULGING ME. YOU KNOW ONE OF THE WELL KNOWN A FEW MINUTES FUND TO THAT OR NOT. WHAT WE'VE GOT OTHER QUESTIONS IF YOU DON'T MIND ASSEMBLY MEMBER THANK CENTER GLAZER SENATOR PAM? THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND SYSTEM OR A WITH FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU -- FOR WE'VE HAD A CHANCE TO TALK TO AND APPRECIATE APPRECIATE YOUR THANK YOU FOR TIME. AND YOUR LEADERSHIP -- YEAH I DO AGREE WITH MY GOOD FRIEND US AND RAZA THAT -- IT DID IS IT NOW THE SHOULD BE SOMETHING IDEALLY. A INTO A NOTED WE ARE NOWHERE NEAR THE IDEAL -- THAT. THAT IT MEETS INTEGRATED TOGETHER THE FACT THAT IT'S NOT MEANS THAT'S WHY WE NEED TO HAVE I THINK STUDIES -- SO I GUESS THE QUESTION I HAVE AND I WON AT FIRST BECAUSE IT TO SEE ISSUE AND THEN S. A ONE THE SPONSORS THE RATS ALSO RESPOND. SO WHAT I SEE IS IS THAT YOU KNOW EVEN TASK FORCE IN TWENTY FOURTEEN UNDERSTANDS ON THE ONLY TASK FORCE IT COMES OUT WITH THE RECOMMENDATION AND THAT WAS. THREE YEARS AGO. AND ONE THE RECOMMENDATIONS IS THAT -- WE SHOULD DO WITH THIS BILL CALLS FOR RIGHT AND I AND I ADMIT THAT I HAVE -- THAT TREMENDOUS. RELUCTANCE TO SOMEONE WHO IS A YOU KNOW PROFESSOR THE OTHER INSTITUTION UC. ODD TO HAVE CURRICULA DICTATED BY. THE LEGISLATURE OUTSIDE BODIES I MEAN THE YOUNG FACULTY HAVE TO DO A LOT OF WORK TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE EDUCATE. BUT IT IS SO I GUESS THE QUESTION I HAVE FOR YOU IS YOU FIRST OF ALL IT IS IS THAT. SO THE REPORT DID RECOMMEND THIS SO. WHAT HAS IT'S BEEN THREE YEARS SO WHAT HAS THE ACADEMIC SENATE DONE? HAS IT -- AND AND WHAT I MEAN WHAT HAS THE ACADEMIC SENATE DONE IS IS THAT IN THE PAST THREE YEARS YOU SHOULD HAVE PUT IT UP FOR DISCUSSION AND ABOUT -- AND EITHR YOU'RE TELLING ME YES WE AGREE. OUR NO WE DON'T AGREE NOT WHETHER BY THAT SO WE'RE ARGUE ABOUT THE BILL BECAUSE AGAIN AND YOU MAKE THE POINT AND I ACTUALLY DO. HAVE IT'S YOUR YOUR CONCERNS THAT. WE IS THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD NOT YOU KNOW THAT WE SHOULD BUT THE FACULTY TAKE THE LEAD BUT NOW THE QUESTION I HAVE IS IS THAT SO HAVE THE FACULTY TAKEN THE LEAD. LIKE YOU KNOW IT'S BEEN THREE YEARS WHAT HAVE YOU DONE. HAVE YOU ACTUALLY DEBATE THIS ISSUE CAN YOU TELL ME THAT YOU VOTED IT DOWN THAT'S WHY IT'S NOT HAPPENED HAS RESULTED WHY ARE YOU PUTTING US IN THIS POSITION OF HAVING TO DEBATE THIS SO -- SO I THAT THAT'S THAT'S IT'S BEEN THREE YEARS SINCE THIS EPORT AND THE RECOMMENDATION CAME OUT SO. I WANT TO KNOW FROM THE FACULTY SENATE AND ALSO ONE NO FOR THE CANCER WHAT IS HE WHAT HAS A CHANCE ARE DONE. TO ENACT THIS PARTICULAR RECOGNIZING ITS YOUR GOVERNANCE SO THAT'S WHY BOTH OF YOU I'M ASKING BOTH OF YOU TO ANSWER THE QUESTIONS. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION AND I APPRECIATE THE MOTIVATION BEHIND IT BELIEVE ME -- AT THE TIME THE REPORT CAME OUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT. PART OF THE DYNAMIC OF THE STATE WHAT ACADEMIC SENATE IS A DIFFERENCE TO CAMPUS AUTONOMY. WHEN IT COMES TO CURRICULAR DECISIONS SO I GUESS MY AND AND THE SO THE ANSWER IS NO WE DID NOT TAKE UP THE REQUIREMENTS? AND I THINK THAT THE I THINK I SO HAVE YOU CALLED ON EACH OF THE CAMPUS IS AS YOU SAID YOU DEFERRED THE CAMPUSES. THAT EACH CAMPUS SHOULD HAVE ALREADY HAD A VOTE ON IN THE PAST THREE YEARS. AND WE HAVE CALLED ON CAMPUSES TO SERIOUSLY CONSIDER THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE ETHICS REYES AND AND AND AND I DIDN'T. IF YOU IF YOU LET ME FINISH ARE WE HAVE NOT SPECIFICALLY SAID TAKE OF THIS REQUIREMENT. SO HAS IT SO HAS IT BEEN A CHEN DIES AND EVERY CAMPUS FACULTY SENATE TO HAVE A DISCUSSION ABOUT THIS REPORT AND THE RECOMMENDATIONS INCLUDING THIS RECOMMENDATION THAT I DO NOT HAVE AN ANSWER. TO OKAY WHEN CAN YOU GIVE ME THE ANSWER THAT. UGH I CAN GET TRY TO GET IT TOO SOON AS POSSIBLE. OKAY SO IT'S IT'S THE SUMMER SO I CAN GET NOW OKAY SO TO LAST ANOTHER QUESTION AND THEN I WANT TO HEAR FROM THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. IF IT HASN'T. IS THERE A COMMITMENT ON PAR THE FACULTY SENATE TO TAKE IT UP BETWEEN BEFORE THE END OF THE YEAR THAT EVERY CAMPUS SHOULD HAVE AT LEAST HAS DISCUSSION AND MADE A PUBLIC DECISION ON WHAT TO DO WITH THIS RECOMMENDATION. THAT IS PRETTY MUCH THE EMBODIMENT OF THE RESOLUTION WHICH PASSED IN MAY SETTING UP A SHARED GOVERNANCE -- MET IS THE ANSWER YES YES OKAY SO BY BEFORE THE END OF THIS YEAR EVERY CAMPUS FACULTY SENATE. WOULD HAVE CONSIDERED AND TAKEN A POSITION ON THIS ON THE RECOMMENDATIONS REPORT INCLUDING SPECIFICALLY THE RECOMMENDATION FOR REQUIRING ETHNIC STUDIES FOR GRADUATION IN THE CAMPUS. TWO QUESTIONS ONE ARE WE TALKING ABOUT THE TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY TWENTY SCHOOL YEAR. ACADEMIC YEAR I AM TALKING ABOUT BEFORE THE END OF THIS CALENDAR YEAR CALENDAR YEAR I KNOW THERE'S THIS ACADEMIC YEAR BUT ACADEMIC SENATE CAN MAKE DECISIONS WITHOUT WAITING FOR AN END OF THE SCHOOL YEAR THEY CAN DO IT. DEAL WE HAVE SIX MONTHS. I CANNOT IT'S AND IT'S NOT TO LIFE ITS NAME IN JULY FIRST YET I CAN GIVE YOU COMMITMENT THAT THE STATE WHAT ECONOMIC SENATE WILL TAKE THIS ISSUE UP I CANNOT GIVE YOU A COMMITMENT THAT EVERY INDIVIDUAL CAMPUS SENATE. WILL TAKE THIS UP AND AND WILL HAVE TAKEN A POSITION ON IT BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO DO THAT IN THE STATE WHAT SENATE DOES NOT HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO DO THAT. OKAY AND IS THAT SOMETHING OKAY FOR THOSE THAT THERE WAS A CHANCE ARE DONE IS THAT SOMETHING THE CHANCEL CALL. FOR SO WE WE DO HAVE INFORMATION THAT LAYS OUT EXACTLY HOW EACH CAMPUS HAS BEEN AND HAS NOT BEEN RESPONSIVE TO EACH AND AND I KNOW THE QUESTION I ASKED IS THAT TAKING UP THIS VERY ISSUE OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE REPORT AND HAVING THE SENATE SIDE LIKE TO DEFER. TO THE SENATE BUT THE SENSE NOT ACTUALLY GOING TO ACT ON IT AND EVEN DEBATE AT THE END THAT'S CONCERNING TO ME. AND IT'S BEEN THREE YEARS SINCE A REPORT CAME OUT. THE THE BASIS OF MY STATEMENT IS SAYING THAT WE ALREADY HAVE SOME INFORMATION THAT WE CAN SHARE WITH YOU RELATIVE TO THOSE CAMPUSES THAT HAVE TAKEN IT UP. AND SO WHAT WE WILL NEED TO DO IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE BASE OF INFORMATION THAT SAYS WHICH CAMPUSES HAVE AND WHICH HAVE NOT. TAKEN OF THIS PARTICULAR ITEM AND THAT IF YOU'RE ASKING THAT WE CAN PROVIDE INFORMATION THERE AND WHICH HAVE AND WHICH HAVE NOT WE CAN CERTAINLY HAVE THAT BY THE END OF THE CALENDAR RIGHT IN IT NO NO ADD INFORMATION IS GREAT. A BUT WHAT I WANNA KNOW ALL YOU HEAR ABOUT'S LEADERSHIP. SO WILL THE CHANCELLOR SO I JUST HEARD YOU KNOW THE THE STATEWIDE SENATE WILL TAKE SOMETHING UP BUT SAYS HE DOESN'T HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO ALTHOUGH I HOPE THE STATEWIDE SENATE WOULD CALL IN EACH OF THE CAMPUS'S TO DO THIS -- I WOULD ALSO HOPE THE CHANCELLOR WOULD COMMIT TO CALLING ON EACH FACULTY SENATE EACH CAMPUS. TO TAKE UP TO DISCUSS AND MAKE A DECISION WHETHER THEY SUPPORT OR OPPOSE. LET'S PUT HIM ON THE RECORD. THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THIS REPORT THAT CAME OUT THREE YEARS AGO THAT WAS DONE I UNDERSTAND IT THE CHANCES BEHEST RIGHT. AND AND AND AND SO THAT WE I'D LIKE TO HEAR BACK FROM THE FACULTY SENATE. ARE DO THEY AGREE WITH THE IDEA OF FOOT THIS GOAL OF THIS BILL COST FOR AS WELL AS THE REST THE REPORT ARE WE GOING TO HIT YOU KNOW RECOMMEND -- ETHNIC STUDIES IS THERE A GRADUATION CLIMATE AS RECOMMENDED BY THIS TASK FORCE SO IT BECAUSE RIGHT NOW WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT IF THE SAYS THAT THEY DON'T ACT. YOU'RE PUTTING US IN A BAD POSITION BECAUSE I AGREE WITH YOU I DON'T WANNA HAVE TO TELL THE FACT THE SENATE WHAT TO DO BUT THE FACT WE SENATE'S NOT EVEN GOING TO ACT THAT PUTS US IN A VERY AWKWARD POSITION WE'VE HEARD A LOT OF POWERFUL TESTIMONY ABOUT. HOW IMPORTANT ETHNIC STUDIES IS A VALUABLE IS NOT ONLY FROM THE PROPONENTS BUT FROM YOURSELVES AND SO I THINK THIS WOULD BE A MATTER OF -- TOP IMPORTANCE GIVEN THE IMPACT OF ETHNIC STUDIES TO THE FACULTY SENATE. AND CHANCELLOR BY THE WAY SO WHERE'S THE CHANCELLOR ON THIS. WELL THE THE THE CHANCELLOR HAS BEEN VERY RESPONSIVE IN TERMS OF IN TERMS OF MAKING SURE THAT THE CAMPUSES. UNDERSTAND THEIR RESEARCH. I I'D LIKE TO SEE A LITTLE MORE LEADERSHIP IN THAT REGARD WEBER CALLING ON THE FACULTY SENATE TO IT EITHER TO EACH OF THE ACTUALLY SENATE'S AND THE PRESIDENTS OF EACH. TO BE SURE THAT THEY ACTUALLY TAKE THIS UP THE GEN DIS TO HAVE A DISCUSSION TO MAKE A DECISION BEFORE THE END OF THE YEAR. SO THAT HOPEFULLY THE SYSTEM COULD MOVE FORWARD I MEAN IF IF EVERYTHING COMES A SAYS WELL THESE ARE ALL THE REASONS. WE DON'T THINK THIS IS A GOOD IDEA OF THIS PUT THAT ON THE RECORD AND LET'S HAVE A DISCUSSION ABOUT THAT MAYBE THERE'S SOMETHING WE CAN DO TO MELIORATE THOSE ISSUES BUT WE CERTAINLY HEARD A LOT OF POWERFUL TESTIMONY NAY HER TO YOU DON'T DISAGREE WITH THAT. ABOUT THE VALUE OF ETHNIC STUDIES AND SO I'D LIKE THE FACULTY TO TAKE THE LEAD. RIGHT I'D LIKE TO FACULTY TAKE THE LEAD INSTEAD OF US HAVING TO DO IT. I MEAN I AGREE WITH YOU I DEBTS THIS IS THIS IS PROBABLY NOT A GOOD IDEA THAT WERE TRYING YOU KNOW THAT FOR THE FIRST TIME WE WERE GONNA POST SO I THEM AND I TALKED. TO SEVERAL WEBER AND EXPRESSED HIS CONCERNS AS WELL BUT I ALSO SUBMIT THAT I HEAR HER FRUSTRATION I HEAR THE FRUSTRATION OF MANY OF THE PEOPLE OF TESTIFIED FOR THE BILL THAT. WHAT'S TAKING SO LONG AND YOU KNOW IF AND IF THERE'S A REASON THE FACT THE SENATE OPPOSES. LET'S UNDERSTAND THAT WHAT'S THE REASON FOR THE OPPOSITION WHAT IS THERE SOMETHING WE COULD DO THE MILLER IT SO WE CAN SOLVE THE PROBLEM. INSTEAD OF WAITING AROUND THIS IT WILL BE HEARD FIFTY YEARS THIS REPORT CAME OUT THREE YEARS AGO. CAN CAN WE HAVE SOMETHING DONE. SO THE THE BASED ON WHAT YOU'RE SAYING THAT THE TEN UP WE'LL GO BACK TO THE CHANCELLOR AND MAKE SURE THAT THE CHANCELLOR HAS A CONVERSATION WITH EACH OF THE PRESIDENT'S. AS A PART OF THE EVALUATION PROCESS THAT I JUST TALKED ABOUT. DETERMINE WHICH ONES HAVE ALREADY TAKEN THIS UP AS AN ISSUE IN HALF THAT AND THEN ASKS THE PRESIDENT'S TO ENSURE THAT THEY'RE WORKING IN COLLABORATION WITH THEIR SENATE'S. TO GET ANSWERS FROM THE OTHERS AS WELL. IS THE ANSWERS I'D LIKE THEM TO ACTUALLY TELL IF GIVE US FEEDBACK TELL TELL HIM WHAT THEIR POSITION IS ON THE RECOMMENDATIONS. AND WHY [inaudible] GET OUT. I MEAN THIS IS NOT JUST ABOUT INFORMATION IS ABOUT LEADERSHIP RIGHT. BUT STE CONFRONT THE ISSUE AND DEAL WITH IT NOT JUST SAY WELL WE COLLECT SOME DATA ABOUT AND I APPRECIATE THERE'S MANY CAMPUSES ACTUALLY YOU KNOW EXACT STATE I TALKED TO THE PRESIDENT -- THERE A DINNER STANDARD. OLD BUT WE HAVE BEFORE US A RECOMMENDATION WE HAVE BEFORE US A BILL THAT BASICALLY SUPPORTS A RECOMMENDATION THAT CAME FROM CSU SYSTEM ITSELF. THE TASK FOR THE CSU SYSTEM ITSELF. RIGHT SO IN THAT SENSE WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT. YEAH I DON'T LIKE THE IDEA OF US IMPOSING THOSE REQUIREMENTS. AT THE SAME TIME. I'VE MET THAT SOME LABOR WEBER ISN'T PULLING THIS OUT OF THIN AIR IT'S NOT JUST SOMETHING THAT SHE WANTS TO IMPOSE ON CSU SHE'S BASICALLY SAYING LET'S. LET'S DO IT A TASK FORCE TO USE YOU ACTUALLY RECOMMENDED. AND SO. YOU KNOW THAT'S NOT ENTIRELY UNREASONABLE. ALTHOUGH AGAIN I'D HAVE CONCERNS THAT YOU'VE EXPRESSED AND I SHARED THAT WE SHOULDN'T BE DICTATING BUT AT SAME TIME. I NEED TO KNOW THAT. CSU ITSELF THEY CREATE A TASK FORCE THAT RECOMMENDATION IS TAKING THAT RECOMMENDATION SERIOUSLY. AND IF THEY DON'T AGREE WITH THAT THEN EXPLAIN WHY NOT AND THEY AGREE WITH IT DO IT. THAT'S WHAT I'M NOT HEARING I'M HEARING YOU KNOW WHERE SOME PEOPLE THAT'S CETERA BUT THIS IT IS A SYSTEM WIDE RECOMMENDATION SO THIS AND SO. I LIKE TO SEE A SYSTEM WIDE RESPONSE IN RECOGNIZE WHAT'S YOUR GOVERNMENT'S NO EACH CAMPUS HAS YOU KNOW HAS OUR OWN ISSUES THEY HAVE TO DEAL WITH TO IN OUR OWN CHARACTERISTICS SO. OKAY FINE HAD LOTS OF EACH CAMPUS BUT THIS IS A PRIORITY. FOR AND I GUESS YOU'RE HEARING FROM US THIS IS A PRIORITY FOR US BUT AGAIN WE RECOGNIZE YOU KNOW SHARED GOVERNANCE SO. WE HOPE THAT YOU MAKE THIS A PRIORITY AND THAT'S WHY I'M CALLING FOR HEARD SAYING WELL CAN YOU PLEASE MAKE A DECISION AND TELL US WHAT YOU DECIDED TO DO. CAMPUS BY CAMPUS RECOGNIZING SOME OF THE INDEPENDENT CAMPUS AS WELL AS THE SYSTEM. BEFORE THE END OF THE YEAR BECAUSE GUESS WHAT NEXT YEAR WE HAVE ANOTHER THE LEGISLATIVE SESSION AND I HOPE THAT YOU SOLVE THE PROBLEM FOR US SO WE DON'T HAVE TO LEGISLATE. WHAT DO YOU THINK? SO BE IT. OKAY ALL RIGHT AND THAT JUST PLEASE DEAL. ALL RIGHT AND ANY. AT THE TIPS THAT YOU KNOW -- I DON'T KNOW IF THEY'RE ANY OF THE QUESTIONS -- I'LL JUST LET ME SAY THAT -- THIS ISSUE OBVIOUSLY HAS BEEN CIRCULATING AROUND FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AND IT SHOULD BE APPARENT TO THIS BODY. BUT THAT BODY IS NOT GOING TO ACT IN THE WAY THAT WE THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE. I MEAN -- AS I SAID YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN AT THE UNIVERSITY FOR FEEL LIKE FOR EVER. AND I'VE SERVED ON ALL OF THE COMMITTEES THAT THEY TALK ABOUT -- AND I KNOW THAT THEY HAVE OFTEN BEEN MANDATE FROM OUTSIDE. THAT HAVE IMPACTED THE CAMPUS. I REMEMBER WHAT ROTC CAME SAN DIEGO STATE. THE FACULTY DID NOT WANT IT. BACK THE SAME ACADEMIC SENATE ACTUALLY VOTED AGAINST. BUT IT WAS ADMINISTRATION AND THE POWERS ABOVE THAT IMPLEMENTED ROTC IT'S AN ABLE STATE. DESPITE ALL OF THOSE QUESTIONS ABOUT OUR RIGHT TO CONTROL CURRICULUM AND TO DECIDE WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO THERE ARE OTHER THINGS THAT HAPPEN AT THIS INSTITUTION. THAT DOT THAT BASICALLY OF DO NOT FOLLOW THIS REALLY PRISTINE ANALYSIS OF A FACULTY ENGAGEMENT AND SO FORTH AND SO ON AND I GUESS THE PROBLEM IS I'VE BEEN BEHIND THE CURTAIN AND I KNOW WHAT'S BEHIND THE CURTAIN. SO I'M NOT IMPRESSED WHEN PEOPLE TELL ME ABOUT THE IVORY TOWER TELL ME ABOUT ACADEMIC FREEDOM DIALOGUE IS THE SENATE COMMITTEES THE DADA DADA DOT. I KNOW THAT'S ALL A WAY OF SAYING IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN WHEN YOU LOOK AT ETHNIC STUDIES ETHNIC STUDIES CAME INTO EXISTENCE NOT BECAUSE PEOPLE THOUGHT IT WAS A GOOD ACADEMIC IDEA. NOT BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT IT WAS TIME BUT IT WAS FAIR IS BECAUSE STUDENTS WERE BURNING BUILDINGS AT IN THE CAMPUS I CAME TO SAN DIEGO STATE BECAUSE A BUNCH OF STUDENTS BURNED ALL THE TRASH CANS OF FROM THE PRESIDENT'S OFFICE. HE REALIZED ALL WE GOT TO HIRE SOME BLACK PEOPLE TO GET UP IN HERE THE STOP THE STUFF. AND THAT'S HOW I GOT HIRED AND THAT'S WHAT MOST LOS GOT HIRED SAN FRANCISCO STATE WAS A PROTEST FOR WELL OVER A YEAR. OKAY EVERY CAMPUS THAT YOU SEE WAS NOT SOME LITTLE ORDERLY PROCESS THAT OCCURRED STUDENTS SO OFTEN WERE DISPEL FROM CAMPUSES I HAVE FRIENDS WHO COULD NOT FINISH THEIR DEGREE CAL STATE LA. AND GUIDED MAYBE TWENTY YEARS LATER BECAUSE THEY WERE EXPELLED FROM THE CAMPUS FOR PROTESTING BUT ETHNIC STUDIES SO THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT IS GOING TO EASILY WALK THROUGH THE IVORY TOWER HOLES AND BE EMBRACED IT IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. THE A LOT OF POLITICS THAT OCCUR% WHEN YOU HAVE WHEN YOU START TALKING ABOUT REQUIRING A COURSE TO BE TAUGHT YOU HAVE BEEN CHANGING THE PERSPECTIVE NOT ONLY OF THE PUBLIC BUT OF THE FACULTY AS WELL. IN TERMS OF WHAT THEY SEE IS IMPORTANT WHAT THEY VALUE THAT'S GOING TO CHANGE IT'S ALSO GOING TO SOMETIMES CHANGE THE DYNAMICS OF POWER AT AN INSTITUTION. BECAUSE STUDENTS NOW WILL BE C. FACULTY WILL HAVE REQUIRED TO SEE PEOPLE WHO DON'T LOOK LIKE THEM WE CAN GIVE THEM INFORMATION THAT THEY DON'T HAVE. IT ALSO CHANGES THE DYNAMICS IN TERMS OF WHO'S FUNDED AND WHO'S NOT FUND IT SO LET'S BE REAL ABOUT IT THIS IS POWER DISCUSSION THIS IS ABOUT WHO WILL HAVE INFLUENCE. NOT ONLY AT THE INSTITUTION BUT WHO WILL HAVE INFLUENCE AND CAL ONE YEAR THE IVORY TOWER SOMEHOW ANOTHER STRONGHOLDS ITSELF INTO THIS IMPARTIAL -- PERSPECTIVE BUT THE REALITY IS IT IS VERY PARTIAL IT IS VERY CONCERNED ABOUT ECONOMICS IT IS VERY CONCERNED ABOUT. MAINTAINING THE STATUS QUO AND WE CAN YOU TO PARTICIPATE IN THAT OR WE CAN CHANGE IT. AND SO I YOU KNOW I'M NOT IMPRESSED AT ALL WITH THE CONVERSATION BECAUSE I KNOW WHAT'S GOING HAPPEN NEXT YEAR THE YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTER IT WE CONTINUE DOWN THIS PATH. AT SOME POINT EVERYTHING WE'VE EVER DONE HAS VIOLATED THE RULES IN ORDER TO GET IT DONE BROWN VERSUS BOARD OF EDUCATION TALKS ABOUT THE ARE WE GOING TO INTERVENE IN STATES WHERE THEY HAVE STATES RIGHTS TO DETERMINE WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN IN SCHOOLS. AND WE FINALLY SAID YES WE HAVE. TO AND WHEN WE BEGIN TO LOOK AT ALL THE CHANGES THAT HAVE OCCURRED IN THIS NATION THEY HAVE ATTAINED THEY'VE A CARD BECAUE PEOPLE DECIDED. ENOUGH IS ENOUGH WE HAVE TO MOVE FOR THIS IS WHAT WE BELIEVE IN AND WE HAVE TO CHANGE THE RULES OF ENGAGEMENT. AND SO WHEN I LOOK AT THE ACADEMIC SENATE HAVING SPENT ALL OF MY LIFE AT THE C. ISSUE. ALL OF MY ACADEMIC LIFE THERE AND WORKING TO CHANGE THE WHAT IS HAPPENING I UNDERSTAND THE LANGUAGE I UNDERSTAND THE BOOKS IN THE HOWEVER BECAUSE MAYBE SO FORTH AND SO ON ALL THE RESTRICTIONS THAT ARE OFTEN PUT UP. TO SIMPLY SAY WE'RE NOT GOING TO DO THIS BECAUSE WE'RE NOT GOING TO EMPOWER STUDENTS TO HAVE THE INFORMATION THEY NEED TO BE THE KIND OF CITIZENS THAT WE WANT. WE COMPLAIN ABOUT ALL THE HATRED IN CALIFORNIA WE COMPLAIN ABOUT THE LACK OF INFORMATION PEOPLE HAVE WE COMPLAIN ABOUT STUDENTS NOT BEING CHALLENGED TO THINK DIFFERENTLY AND TO FORM A CALIFORNIA THAT IS VERY VERY DIFFERENT. I SEE WHAT HAPPENS TO WHITE STUDENTS WHO TAKE ETHNIC STUDIES THEIR LIVES ARE CHANGED FOREVER THE PERSPECTIVES ARE CHANGED FOR EVER AND AND SO WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THIS NOT JUST AS A BLACK BROWN THING. BUT WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THIS AS RESCUE IN CALIFORNIA IF WE'RE EVER GOING TO TALK ABOUT ETHNIC STUDIES IN K. TWELVE IT IS BECAUSE WE HAVE EDUCATED THE TEACHER TEACHERS IN THE C. ISSUE TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT. TO BE ABLE TO CHANGE THE COMMON NARRATIVE THAT'S THERE AND TO PRESENT THE INFORMATION THAT'S ALWAYS CENTRAL. THIS IS CRITICAL FOR CALIFORNIA BEING THE DIVERSE STATE IT WANTS TO BE HAVE THE INFORMATION TO MAKE THE DIFFERENCE IN THE LIVES OF OUR YOUNG PEOPLE BUT IN THE LIVES OF ALL OF US. AND IT'S ONLY FOR THAT REASON THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AND I BOTH DID YOU TO HAVE THE COURAGE TO JOIN ME AND NOT LISTEN TO THE NARRATIVE THAT I HAVE LISTEN TO FOR FIFTY YEARS. ALL IN TERMS OF WHAT THE UNIVERSITY CAN AND CANNOT DO BECAUSE I KNOW THEY DO WHAT THEY WANT TO DO WHEN THEY WANT TO DO IT REGARDLESS OF WHO WAS IN CHARGE. WHO HAS A ROLE TO DO IT WHO HAS THE RIGHT TO DO IT ALL THOSE KINDS OF THINGS? I HAVE BEEN A PART OF THAT FOR EVER I KNOW THE NARRATIVE I KNOW THE LANGUAGE AND THANK GOD I'M HERE TO TELL YOU THAT IT'S ALL. UNFAIR UNFOUNDED AND IF I BELIEVE IN THE EASTER BUNNY THEN I WOULD BELIEVE IN THAT SO ONCE AGAIN I ASK FOR YOU TO VOTE FOR THIS BILL FOR AB FOURTEEN SIXTY FOR US TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT. AND THE CHALLENGES SYSTEM AS IT SHOULD BE. THANK YOU DOCTOR WEBER -- OKAY. SO NONE OF US EVER WANT TO FOLLOW DR WEBBER BUT BEFORE WE VOTE. I DO JUST WANT TO EXPRESS MY OPINION ON THE BILL -- AND I DO HAVE TO SAY TO THE C. ISSUES. I THINK YOU GUYS COULD COME A LITTLE BIT MORE PREPARED IT'S REALLY CLEAR THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THE ACADEMIC SENATE HAS RECOMMENDED THAT THE EXIT WITH THE TASK FORCE HAS RECOMMENDED. THAT IT HASN'T BEEN INSTITUTED AS WE'VE GONE OVER IN THREE YEARS WE'VE HEARD PEOPLE TALK ABOUT THIS BEING A PRECEDENT AND IT'S NEVER HAPPENED. AND I WOULD JUST SAY THAT NEVER NEVER HAPPENS UNTIL IT DOES HAPPEN AND SOMETIMES WE HAVE. TO WE HAVE TO CHANGE THE STATUS QUO AND AS I SAID WITH THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER MEDINA IS BILL HOW DO WE EXPECT IN AS YOU ARTICULATED VERY WELL DOCTOR WEBER HOW DO WE EXPECT PEOPLE TO KNOW ABOUT EACH OTHER IF WE DON'T GIVE THEM THE OPPORTUNITY O LEARN ABOUT. EACH OTHER HOW DO WE EXPECT TO BREAK DOWN WALLS BREAKDOWN BAY AREA BARRIERS EXCEPT EACH OTHER LOVE EACH OTHER IF WE DON'T TEACH OUR YOUNG PEOPLE -- SO I I AM VERY HAPPY TO TO SUPPORT THE BEING AN ADVOCATE AND WORKING SO HARD AND TIRELESSLY ON THIS. FOR ALL THE YEARS THAT YOU'VE THAT YOU'VE BEEN DOING IT AND I JUST THINK THAT WE NEED TO CHANGE AND IF WE DON'T CHANGE THINGS FOR OUR YOUNG PEOPLE. THEN HOW CAN WE EVER EXPECT A BETTER FUTURE SO I THINK YOU VERY MUCH THE MORE WE KNOW ABOUT EACH OTHER THE MORE WE WILL KNOW THAT WE ARE MORE ALIKE THAN DIFFERENT. AND I WOULD SAY TO ALL OF MY COLLEAGUES IF NOT US THEN WHO. AND IF NOT WIN. IF NOT NOW THEN WHEN WE HAVE A MOTION BY SENATOR TO ROSAMOND SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. ITEM TWELVE AB FOURTEEN SIXTY THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS LEYVA AYE LEYVA AYE WILK CHIANG RUSSELL. RUSSELL AYE GLAZER MCGUIRE PAN. WE WILL LEAVE THAT BILL ON CALL THANK YOU VERY MUCH DOCTOR WEBER. ALRIGHT MEMBERS WE ARE MOVING ON TO FILE ITEM ELEVEN ASSEMBLY MEMBER GIPSON. THIS IS FILE ITEM ARE EXCUSE ME THIS IS AB. THIRTEEN FIFTY FOUR BEGIN WHEN YOU'RE READY BUT IF YOU WANT TO WAIT FOR THE ROOM TO CLEAR A LITTLE BIT THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER WELCOME TO THE COMMITTEE ON EDUCATION YOU'RE WELCOME TO BEGIN AS SOON AS YOU'RE READY AND AND AND RECOVERED FROM THAT WONDERFUL FINISH BASE.

THIS PODIUM BUT AGAIN THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL THIRTEEN FIFTY FOUR WHICH WILL ENSURE CONSISTENT EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR YOU WHO WERE FORMALLY INCARCERATED. FOR ME FOR ME -- IN THE JUVENILE OF JUVENILE JUSTICE -- SYSTEM THIS BILL REQUIRES THE COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION TO COLLABORATE WITH THE PROBATION ON AN INDIVIDUALIZED TRANSITION PLAN FOR YOU TRANSITIONING OUT OF JUVENILE -- COURTS SCHOOL EXISTING LAW AND ACTED -- BUT BY THE ABOUT THE SIGNING OF AB. TWENTY TWO SIXTY SEVEN BOCANEGRA IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN REQUIRES A JOINT TRANSITION PLAN A SEARCH TO WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS WHEN INDIVIDUALS RE OF GETTING OUT OF THE JUVENILE -- COURT SCHOOL -- IT WILL MANDATE THAT A PLAN IS PUT IN PLACE FAR TOO LONG INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE COMING OUT OF JUNE OUT OF FACILITIES -- BILL AND GO THROUGH A BLACK HOLE FALL THROUGH THE CRACKS -- IN THE SYSTEM WHERE WHEN THEY RETURNED TO A PUBLIC SCHOOL COMMUNITY SCHOOL -- THERE IS NO PLAN FOR THEM TO SUCCEED I'M A FIRM BELIEVER AS MY MOTHER SAID IF YOU DON'T PLAN YOU PLAN TO FAIL AND SO THIS MANDATES ALL PARTIES INVOLVED TO COLLABORATE WITH PROBATION. THE THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCAL SERVICES TO MAKING SURE THAT A PLAN IS PUT IN PLACE TO MAKING SURE THAT THESE YOUNG PEOPLE'S TRANSITIONING. FROM THE JUVENILE -- FACILITY HAS A PLAN THAT WOULD TRANSITION THAT WILL GET THEM ON THE RIGHT COURSE IS THE RIGHT CLASSES FOR THEM TO TAKE -- WHEN GOING BACK TO THEIR HOME SCHOOLS -- THIS COMES HAVE COME OUT OF A WORK GROUP OF STUDENTS -- WERE PUT THIS PLAN TOGETHER AND A NUMBER OF TESTIMONIES HAVE COME FORTH OF THE STUDENTS WHO HAVE FALLEN THROUGH THE CRACKS AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE AS WE MOVE FORWARD. THAT THERE'S A CONSISTENT PLAN THROUGH A MANDATE THAT WOULD MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR THESE YOUNG PEOPLE TO SUCCEED WITH ME TO PROVIDE SUPPORTING TESTIMONY -- BUT THIRTEEN FIFTY FOUR ARE A REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE YOUTH LAWCENTER AS WELL AS A JAY YOU THINK CHU WITHOUT COALITION REPRESENTATIVE WHO WAS SELF INTRODUCED IN SUPPORT OF THIRTEEN FIFTY FOUR VERY GOOD WITNESSES IN FAVOR [inaudible] WELCOME.

THIRTEEN FIFTY FOUR EDUCATION IS THE MOST IMPORTANT RESOURCE WE NEED TO GET A JOB. THAT PAYS ENOUGH TO LIVE ON GET OFF THE STREETS AND STAY OUT OF JAIL. BUT 90% OF THE YOUTH AND CALIFORNIA'S JUVENILE HALLS PROBATION CAMPS AND RANCHES IN BJJ FACILITIES WAS SUSPENDED OR EXPELLED BEFORE THEY WERE LOCKED THE I WANT TO FINISH HIGH SCHOOL IN LOS ANGELES AND I GOT KICKED OUT FOR FIGHTING NO ONE EVER ASKS ME WHAT MADE ME SO ANGRY -- SAT ME DOWN WITH OTHER STUDENTS TO WORK THINGS OUT I WASN'T REFERRED TO ANOTHER SCHOOL. WHICH I FOUND OUT LATER IS IS GET STATE LAW INSTEAD I WAS OUT OF SCHOOL FOR MONTHS. I WILL LEAVE EVERY DAY FROM HOMES TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE I WAS IN SCHOOL. BUT I WAS REALLY IN THE STREETS ARE THEM ON MY MAMA KNOWS KICKED OUT OF SCHOOL EVENTUALLY. OUR ROAD IN ANOTHER SCHOOL BUT THERE WHEN A TEACHER MADE A RACIST COMMENT IN CLASS I LOST MY TEMPER IN A THROUGH CHAIR. THE TEACHER CALLED THE POLICE AND I WAS ARRESTED AND TAKEN TO JUVENILE HALL. PROBATION TELL ME THIS IS WHERE I WOULD BE FOR A LONG TIME IF I DIDN'T STRAIGHTEN STRAIGHTEN UP. I WAS TOLD I WOULDN'T BE HOME FOR CHRISTMAS I GUESS THEY WERE TRYING TO SCARE ME IT WAS A VERY HUMILIATING EXPERIENCE. AT JUVENILE HALL ARE WAS NEVER TESTED OR SAYS ON MY EDUCATIONAL NEEDS. I WAS NEVER ROLLED IN SCHOOL EVEN THOUGH I WAS THERE FOR WEEKS WHEN I WAS RELEASED I GOT NO REFERRAL TO ANOTHER SCHOOL. NO TRANSCRIPTS I HAD NO ID ALL OF THESE THINGS ARE ESSENTIAL TO GET INTO SCHOOL. AS THEIR PROBATION BASICALLY KICKED ME OUT TO THE STREETS. I WAS PUT ON PROBATION FOR THREE YEARS DURING THE ENTIRE TIME I WAS ON PROBATION I NEVER HAVE SUPPORT AND ROLE IN SCHOOL I WAS TOLD TO DO ANGER MANAGEMENT CLASSES FOR HIGH RISK HIGH NEEDS. YOU'VE BUT MY MOTHER COULDN'T AFFORD THE FEES SO BASICALLY ALL I GOT DURING THOSE THREE YEARS WAS DRUG TESTED. I AM A ROLE NOW DO YOU JUSTICE COLLISIONS HIGH SCHOOL AND I KNOW I WILL GRADUATE BUT IT IS HARD. ALL THE TIME OUT OF SCHOOL BROKE MY CONFIDENCE IN MY LOVE FOR LEARNING. AND I HAVE TO GET USED TO HAVING THE SAYS GRADUAL SCHEDULE FOR SCHOOL EVERY DAY. THE STREETS IN TROUBLE PULLS HARD ON THE U. IT'S NO MYSTERY WHY WE ARE ALL IN THE STREETS WE NEED TO EAT. AND WHEN YOU FALL BEHIND THE SCHOOL YOU START TO BELIEVE THAT SHE WON'T MAKE IT WOULD EDUCATION. THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF YOU THAT HAVE MY SAME STORY BUT CURRENT LAW DOESN'T REQUIRE ANY OVERSIGHT OF SERVICES AND SUPPORTS. LIKE HELP WAS SCHOOL RECORDS AND CREDITS TRANSFERS ALL THE THINGS THAT I NEEDED. AB THIRTEEN FIFTY FOUR WILL REQUIRE THAT THE COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION AND PROBATION TO DEVELOP A PERSONAL PLAN WITH THE STUDENT AND THEIR FAMILY IN ORDER TO MEET THE ACADEMIC. SOCIAL EMOTIONAL AND CAREER NEEDS OF EACH STUDENT WHO WAS LOCKED UP FOR MORE TAN TWENTY CONSECUTIVE SCHOOL DAYS. I HOPE WILL ENCOURAGE THEM TO EVENTUALLY GUARANTEE THAT ALL YOUTH WHO ARE RISKY GET THE SERVICES. AND OUR SCHOOLS AND OUR JUVENILE HALLS IN ALL YOU FACILITIES WE NEED COLLAGEN JOB PREPARATION BUT WE ARE GETTING PRISON PREPARATION. THAT'S THE REASON WHY SO MANY YOU GRADUATE NOT BY WALKING THE STATE'S BOUGHT BUT BY WALKING THE PRISON YARD.

MANY OF THEM WILL DROP OUT OF SCHOOL TOGETHER AND MISS THOMASES TESTIMONY REALLY. EXEMPLIFIES THAT UNFORTUNATELY -- AND WE KNOW THAT EDUCATION IS KEY TO GIVING YOUTH ESPECIALLY YOUTH WITH TO PROMOTE US TO SYSTEM INVOLVEMENT OPPORTUNITIES TO DEVELOP THE SKILLS AND KNOWLEDGE THEY NEED. TO PREPARE FOR THE FUTURE AND HAVE A PRODUCTIVE LIFE -- UNFORTUNATELY YOUNG PEOPLE LIKE MISS THOMAS ARE LEAVING JUVENILE FACILITIES. THE FIRST THERE THEY ARE STRUGGLING TO GET RE ENROLLED IN THEIR COMMUNITY SCHOOLS. THEY'RE STRUGGLING TO GET CREDIT FOR THE WORK THEY DO IN THE COURTS SCHOOLS. AND THEY AREN'T GETTING INTO THE COURSES THAT THEY NEED TO CONTINUE THEIR ACADEMIC. PROGRESS. I'M. AB TWENTY TWO SEVENTY SIX WAS ONE OF THE BILLS THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER GIPSON MENTIONED -- A WORK GROUP FROM THAT BILL MADE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT ARE REFLECTED IN THIS BILL.

SO -- BY SUPPORTING AB THIRTEEN FIFTY FOUR YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADVANCE LEGISLATION THAT BUILDS ON FORMER LEGISLATION.

ESPECIALLY SINCE THERE IS NO END IN SIGHT FOR THE FEDERAL ADMINISTRATIONS CONSTANT THREATS TO DOCTOR ARE. UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS CENTERS AND STAFF PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE AT OUR COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES -- AS IMMIGRANT IMMIGRATION POLICIES RAPIDLY SHIFT -- AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. ESTABLISHING A PERMANENT AND INSTITUTIONALIZED DREAM RESEARCH THE AS A LIAISON ON CALIFORNIA COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES WILL PROVIDE UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS WITH ADEQUATE EDUCATIONAL SUPPORT. WITH ME TODAY I HAVE EVER HUMANE AS A YOUTH ORGANIZER WITH THE CALIFORNIA DREAM NETWORK TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL WELCOME. HELLO IT'S AN HONOR TO BE HERE ARE PRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA JING NETWORK IT CONSISTS OF OVER FORTY CAMPUSES. COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND I'VE BEEN VERY PRIVILEGED TO MEET SOME OF THE STUDENTS WHO ARE ACTIVISTS FURTHER DOCUMENTED AND IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES. AND I'VE ASKED THEM WAS URGING LIAISON AGING CENTER WOULD MEAN FOR THEM. AND JUST FOR WHAT THEY'VE TOLD ME IS BASICALLY IT'S A SAFE AND INCLUSIVE SPACE FOR THEM -- IT'S VERY OBVIOUS THAT DURING THIS% TIME. MANY OF US FEEL FEEL -- UNSAFE AND SOMETIMES EVEN ATTACKED DURING A WITHIN OUR CAMPUSES. AND THIS IS A SAFE SPACE FOR FOR STUDENTS IS A A PLACE WHERE THEY CAN BE THEMSELVES OR THEY CN. HAVE THE CONFIDENTIALITY AND THE OPPORTUNITIES TO BE ABLE TO WORK AMONGST THEMSELVES TO BE ABLE TO GET THE RESOURCES THEY NEED. AND THAT WAS ANOTHER POINT THEY WANTED TO MAKE WAS THAT THERE ARE SO MANY RESOURCES AVAILABLE ON COLLEGE COLLEGE CAMPUSES. BUT THE RESOURCES ARE SOMETIMES VERY CENTERED AROUND A RESIDENCY AND CITIZENSHIP FOR STUDENTS AND A CENTER HAVING A DREAM MAYES ON HAVING A DREAM CENTER WHAT ALLOW STUDENTS TO BE ABLE. TO GET ACCESS TO THESE RESOURCES AND MANY OF THEM THEY DON'T REALLY KNOW. WHAT OPPORTUNITIES ARE THERE OUT THERE FOR THEM ESPECIALLY DURING THE TIMES THAT -- IMMIGRATION DEBATES ARE HAVE THE SYSTEM VERY IT FLUCTUATED WHERE WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON SOMETIMES. AND THAT'S WHAT THIS IS THIS BILL WOULD. ALLOW STUDENTS TO TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THAT SPACE AND THAT PERSON THAT WILL DIRECT THEM TO THE RIGHT RESOURCES THAT THEY NEED. AND I WOULD LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT TO ONE OF OUR MEMBERS HER NAME IS ABOVE IT NOT. AND SHE ACTUALLY FOUGHT FOR A DREAM CENTER AT HERS THE COLLEGE IS YEAR OF COLLEGE. AND MY MAIN CONCERN. FOR I WE'RE REALLY PROUD OF THE WORK SHE DID BUT I MAIN CONCERN IS THAT STUDENTS SHOULD NOT HAVE TO GO THROUGH ALL THESE DIFFICULTIES TO BE ABLE. TO GET THE RESOURCES AND THE HELP THEY NEED IT SHOULD BE ABLE TO BE THERE FOR THEM WHEN THEY GO TO THEIR COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY. AND AT THE REASON UC DAVIS GRADUATE I'M VERY PROUD TO SAY THAT YOU SEE DAVIS HAD THE FIRST A BOUT FORTY AND DOCUMENTS STUDENT CENTER. SO THAT WAS REALLY HELPFUL AND THAT'S HOW I MEAN WHAT TO STAND HERE BEFORE YOU AS A FIRST GENERATION DOCUMENTS STUDENT GRADUATE. THANK YOU. EXCELLENT THANK YOU FOR SHARING YOUR STORY NEXT WITNESS.
