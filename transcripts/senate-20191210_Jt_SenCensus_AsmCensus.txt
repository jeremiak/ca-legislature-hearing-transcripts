Of Robert Garcia. Mayor Garcia did you want to say a few words.

I want to just first say on behalf of- of the council and all of us here in Long Beach I we want to thank you for the incredible work that's happening around the census- we've been telling our senses team here at the city that there is no bigger issue. And twenty twenty then for us to ensure that everyone is counted. And the ramifications as we all know- that will affect everything that we do. All of the funding mechanisms and programs are critical for us to get the services that we need I'm in a good count I'm is not just about representation- it's about finding it's about equity it's about ensuring that people get the social services that they need- and it's making sure that we know who completely is a part of our community. I will share is you will know that we are incredibly- concerned about are harder to count communities. We are incredibly concerned about ensuring that all people- including those are documented in our community or a part of our our census count. I mean we're very grateful to the state for the significant I really think it's significant funding and support. Has come down from the governor and the legislature. We want to be. Our partners are I am very proud there's a lot of folks that are here. I'm in in the audience and I recognize that are part of our- complete count team. I think Long Beach is a great model we have a complete team we have a broad. A coalition of community organizations and labor and business and nonprofits and government. Other working together to insure that everyone is counted. I'm and the last thing I'll say is. I was reading an article this morning in the paper and I'm I do know that while lot of our a larger cities seem to be well organized- still need I think up and down the state. Are from four from some smaller communities some communities with large hard account populations that don't seem to have yet- even a coordinated within their city- to help with the census and so I'm really hoping that. We're not just probably looking at a larger cities but that every single person up and down the state I gets counted. I'm sorry I'm just thank you for being here- in Long Beach center I'm bird we're very grateful you represent a part of our city and to everyone else thank you. But in the long Mitchell thank you thank you mayor Garcia and merit I want to. One applaud you but but I also want to thank you. For leading by example- you you've been a great example for other community leaders other mers run the state of California. In terms of both the importance of the senses in the investment of both personnel and treasure. Into making sure that we do get a complete count and so on behalf of. I'm gonna. Take the- up to thank you on behalf of both committees for your leadership thank you thank you much. Thank you mayor- we're we're pleased to be able to. Hold this- joint meeting of the assembly select committee on the senses the Senate select committee on that. Twenty twenty United States. Census I am most grateful for other committee. Co chairs being here- some remember mark Berman from up north from from Menlo Park- recently recently moved to Menlo Park is that right yeah two weeks ago. And senator Richard pan from Sacramento in our esteemed colleague. Related to Russell here from Los Angeles- before we begin I'm going to ask if the- members here of the committee and we're I think we're gonna be joined by US senator Le√≥n consolidate some point in time here today- if members of the- select committees would like to make opening statements let me first turned to- senator pan. And then to assembly member Berman and then to our colleague Senate Russell. Thank you very much- Sir- Burke and appreciate your- continued partnership as a co chair of the Senate select committee on twenty twenty cents a somewhat thank. Your C. and the people of the city of Long Beach for welcoming us here to have this hearing today. And what they call the witnesses who are joining us today for our fourth joint hearing on twenty twenty census- nor past hearings have provided a general overview of California complete counts program operations strategy in funding and fact most recent- hearing focused on language access. This hearing we're gonna be hearing from both the Los Angeles and Orange County partner to learn more about outreach strategy in this particular region I think more specifically. Also interested as we are approaching really the US census when- happened I mean we're just months away. Think about it's not that far away. To be sure that we have this is the appropriate- interface- between our- the people on the ground in the community the- local entities like is the- the counties and other partners in the C. vios and the state. And to be sure that- we have- clearer lines of- expectations and lines responsibility- between- each of the different entities I realize that may be different in different areas- I think I appreciate that the mayor of Long Beach brought up that. No one perhaps in some cities where there are you know more organizations and people to working a longer. May need- less help from it's a state or regional entities whereas other communities may need more assistance. But we what we want to be sure those especially we talk about the hard to count- we can't let people fall in the gaps because of organizational problems that we have so- I. John eager to hear how both- what's happening here I won't call a microcosm given how big LA in Orange County are it's America because of the state- but I think you- this hearing will hopefully set the two counties as examples of. How we're all this is all starting to come together in preparation for the count in April it's again not that far away so again I really appreciate this opportunity to hear about. How this is going how we're gonna reach the hard count have a going to. Reach the variety of different communities we need to count in order to be sure we have a complete census. Data like to- turn it over to- and the chair of the assembly- committee- and my good friend so member Berman thank you so much. Thank you so much larger pan and center amber again and the mayor Garcia and the city of Long Beach. For hosting us- as we all know the status can- committed considerable statewide planning and resources. Towards the achievement of a complete and accurate census count in California. However while planning and resources are important. They aren't enough. We know that success will be decided by what is actually achieved at the grass its roots level. How well we do in reaching a complete count will be determined neighborhood my neighbor. Street by street in door by door. If the census ever were a basketball game. I know basketball's cool again in the LA Long Beach broader area- then we de and during the third quarter right now. The freight Beth was rough in northern California right now I'm a little. It's nice to be down here- this it will be entering the third quarter right now- the first quarter was spent identifying the challenges developing relationships and building a plan. The last six months the second quarter was a bit more operational as we've begun the on the ground work. But as we enter the third quarter the three months leading up to census day. It's critical that we pause we evaluate what is worked what hasn't worked and what new challenges have come up that we didn't anticipate earlier. And improve our plans before moving forward so it's kind of similar to what coaches and a team I do at halftime. For example today we will discuss how to solve an urgent need. For more census enumerators who serve an essential role in contacting our hard account communities. While the numerator recruitment and hiring technically falls under control of the U. S. census bureau. This is quickly becoming a risk to the entire success of the census which is a problem for all of us. I hope to hear that our senses partners of the state. Local and community level will step up. To help get this effort back on track so that we can all accomplish our goals. Similarly this is an opportunity to learn about what is working in Long Beach. Or Los Angeles Orange County and see if those efforts can be replicated in other communities across California. If we're going to accomplish this if we are truly going to critically evaluate our progress and make the improvements necessary to achieve a complete count. Then this must be a time for open and honest communications freely given cooperation and expanded inclusion especially the potential contributors were still on the sidelines. So it's my hope that today's Frank and honest conversations will help us in that effort. Thank you so M. member Berman and now let me turn to our our colleague senator Russell. Great thank you very much. Thank you chair number again. My other brothers appear- I just want to mention- center- Bergen night we're on the Senate budget subcommittee and I chair that- subcommittee number for where we had a lot of testimony come before us from organizations community organizations from really small rural towns in central California- to the larger cities. And our what I remember distinctly in our conversations which was why we pushed an added an additional thirty million dollars to the original- proposed budget. Were a few things that stand out in my mind one is that the media and communications strategy was not going to be limited to. The usual maybe one or two or three languages that there was going to be a serious effort to getting into building language capacity in some of our smallest areas in the state- so language capacity and the use of media. Very very local- media outlets and communications methods- had to be used- and that was one reason why we needed to push for additional funding the other is examples of the trust messengers the trust. Is built up in certain areas which is why I was pushing for- the schools to get more funding- there's not a single community in the state that doesn't have a school. Is not a single coming in the state- where parents don't trust the teachers and the administrators they rely on them they count on them. And so communicating a message of importance and urgency are on the census- comes more powerfully through these messengers that are trustworthy along side of course our community based activist- our churches of all faiths. There's other ways as well but I just wanted to emphasize those as some examples today I hope. To get up to two things where are we where do we stand and what we need to do in the remaining short time before the census actually starts- hitting our our communities and our and our residents. I appreciate- that there could be a lot of phone. Speeches on the importance of the senses but I think we're past that. Everybody knows how important the censuses what I really want to hear today is where are we what we need to know it's urgent we're really down- as assembly member Berman said we're really down to the last- critical moments so- I hope that- I know I intend to listen- as much as possible. And I hope all these issues are covered thank you very much. Thank you senator Russell and we're pleased to be joined by a Long Beach is on senator- senator Gonzalez a good follis welcome. Thank you and you'll have to pardon my sickness I've got a little bit of a cold but I'm really happy to be here and thank you to senator Umberg and pan and- simply member Berman and- US senator the Russell for having me I'm not on the committee but it's really great to be here especially- representing the thirty third Senate district that encompasses most of Long Beach. And southeast LA a where we know is the third- to be affected- relative to the census and the number so in addition to the importance absolutely we want to make sure we're on the same- consistency in messaging and that we're doing everything we can for communities so thank you very much again for having me here. What well thank you all- it it's a hundred days until the census. Really begins our nation's say it that way because the preparation and the- anticipation and the planning. Began quite sometime ago but until of the actual. Starting gun sounds it's a hundred days so in the next Hundred Days a tremendous amount of effort and tremendous number of resources of both devoted by the state as well as local communities to make sure we get a complete count- I know- miss Carnegie is heard me I know she's going to testify little later on mentioned several times that that one of our concerns one of my concerns and make. Sure that that we have accountability so that all the resources that are going to be poured into this effort are are going to be used most. Ifish efficiently as is possible and so today I'm gonna ask questions with respect to metrics questions with respect to accountability questions with respect to transparency and how we can make sure that we get a complete count- and we make sure that the taxpayers- the- there. Funds with which they entrust us are spent efficiently so having said that. Let me now turn to the first panel- we're we're pleased to have- let me announce who's going to be here from Los Angeles county. Of Jana your eBay chief executive officer strategic integration branch. Of the city of Los Angeles marina del- lose Garcia- director the census twenty twenty initiative from the Los Angeles mayor's office of budget and innovation.

And from the city of Santa Ana our own daisy Peres senior management system. So let let me begin with miss- you Rebay- if you like to kick it off I'd be grateful. Thank you the floor is yours good afternoon chairman number chairman pan German Berman the members of the committee. I am with LA county chief executive office thank you for the opportunity today to share the county's efforts to educate and encourage our residents to participate in the census. Today I will be addressing how LA county the hardest county in the nation plans to meet the challenges we face with the census. We've already documented our challenges so now is the time for action and thanks to the support of the state legislature and the California complete count office we have the resources and support needed. To launch LA county's twenty twenty census education outreach campaign. The twenty twenty census was always going to be a major challenge which would require collaboration and strong partnerships. As mentioned in past testimony to the committee coordination with partners locally regionally and statewide has been a cornerstone of the county's planning efforts. As outreach efforts move forward into twenty twenty. And implemented the county will continue to work closely with our partners including the city of LA. Long Beach California community foundation LA regional census table the state census office in the US census bureau. In a variety of key partners including city schools higher education businesses chambers and unions. Beginning in early twenty twenty the county will launch a local comprehensive multi lingual media marketing and community outreach engagement campaign with a focus on our hearts account populations the plan will consist of. Paid earns an ethnic media digital tool kits lie branded events. Mobile census action kiosk and targeting messaging highlighting local county programs that belie on census data. The size and scale of our campaign is directly dependent on financial resources and coordination with the state's own media and marketing campaign. The county looks forward to continue coordination with the state in that aspect. The county recognizes that one of the most significant resources are count our county departments and our work force with over thirty six county departments and a hundred and thirteen thousand employees collectively we have the capacity. And the resources to reach our ten million residents. And educate them on the importance of the census for example the department of public social services touches nearly three point five million clients many of them also cover hard to count populations. County departments to date have submitted out reach plan develop unique strategies targeting are hard to count population Anil corporate census met messaging and their daily interaction with clients. Whether resident is receiving public health services at a clinic or excess scene are assessing the variety of social services our county has to offer. Our dedicated work force will educate and motivate residents in the places and spaces they visit. In January twenty twenty will also launch the county census champion program encouraging all our employees to take the census pledge to ensure their household. Families friends and communities are counted. The county is administering a prophet two thirds of its nine point four million allocation from the stent from the state for outreach efforts and our sixty seven cities and forty five on a corporate areas that have part two count communities. Fighting allocations were based on data measures develop by both the US census bureau and the state. The county is contracting directly with two of our largest hard to count cities are here with us today Los Angeles and the city of LA. We gave the remaining cities the option to either pull their resources with the county. And be eligible for a compliment services including digital me I'm media took its direct mail campaigns are earned and paid media out reach. For those cities that choose to take their funding allocations. They can develop their own out reach plans but they have to follow state and out- county requirements this is to speak to set certain cities are actually kind of. More poise to implement census out reach so we wanted to kind of be mindful that give cities the option. Do the digital by that still exist in limited access to broadband internet packing are hard to count populations. The county together with the city developed a robust listing of potential sex census action kiosk and questioner assistance centers. Which are locations where the public can access an internet enabled device developed the census or get their questions. About the census answered. County locations will serve as questioner system centers and be stopped by train county employees. Given the recent state issued cat guidelines wrist regarding C. A. keep case and Cubase sees issued by the state will have to probably make modifications to that program according to how we originally envisioned it. The county wide complete cow committee call led by the county NC a have been engaged is engaging various sectors. Higher education subcommittee develop a tool kit for average to students and school administrators and we're proud to say that was actually shared statewide. We will also be developing and distributing a tool kit with ideas for businesses of all sizes on how to incorporate the census into their activities early next year will be sharing that with our partners in local cities. We're working closely with our unions include the SEIU to conduct outreach. In coordination with the Los Angeles mayor's office last week we held a briefing with the counselor core offices in LA county to bring them up to speed on our local planning efforts. Together with first five in the LA county office of education we also convened our state partners and local partners to discuss and share our reach targeting are zero to five population in our case the twelfth. For the county these are the following key issues moving forward. Counting the homeless population. LA county has the highest number. Of people experiencing on sheltered homelessness in the nation and as such counting the population will be a major major challenge under the census bureau's current plant operation. He partners including the city of LA Long Beach as well as L. A. homeless services authority and C. C. F. in the state census office have met with the census bureau to learn more about. Their process and how we can work together to address structural barriers berries to county this population. The county is appreciated that the state yesterday issued their final requirements and guidelines for the C. A. Kays and Q. AC's. The county will continue to work with the state to comply with these guidelines. To host are these locations the total number of locations is dependent on this. Over the next fourteen weeks it will be critical for the recruitment of applicants to be hired as a numerators. With the positions for the US census bureau to assist the US census bureau with this efforts our own county department I. workforce development agency your services. Will be conducting six recruiting and pre screen events this month with American job centers of California. These events in partnership with the census bureau being held in hard to count areas with one being organized specifically to recruit veterans I also want to. Note that we're working closely with the city of Long Beach now late to also kind of help support these efforts to hire numerators. At the county in C. sample continue to work with the states communications office and media contractor on coordinating our media plans. We look forward to receiving the state specific local media plants given the substantial effort necessary to operate operationalize these programs in the region. We understand that the planning for the twenty twenty census is a fluid process. And we respectfully quest the state continues to consider. As out reach to homeless. Additional security in language access measures at our questionnaire assistance centers and kiosk. Additional Andy Murray a numerator recruitment. And unforeseen challenges during the non response follow up period. In closing we recognize the importance of our local efforts and how they will impact political representation and federal funding for the next decade we appreciate the state's second commitment to ensuring a complete and accurate count in Los Angeles Los Angeles county. And look for to continue to work closely with our friends at the state. Thank you. Thank you and in with the my co chairs permission what I'd like to do is have- the various panelists testified save our questions the end all right there seems to be consensus thank you very much next. Miss some read the look. A loose- Garcia from the city of Los Angeles thank you thank you for being here. Fuhrman's Amberg pan and Berman and members of the committee thank you for giving me the opportunity to share with you an update on the city of Los Angeles's. Outreach efforts for the twenty twenty census I'd like to thank the governor's office in the California State Legislature for investing a record setting amount of funds. That has enabled our outreach efforts. The city of Los Angeles began preparing for twenty twenty a full three years ahead of the census. Among mayor Garcetti's first actions was to issue executive director of twenty one. Re establishing the office of the census instructing all city departments to designate a census liaison. And to develop action plans for conducting census twenty twenty out reach. The core premise of our approach is based on collaboration from the bottom up. For the first time in Los Angeles is modern history we partnered with the county of Los Angeles to form one single local complete count committee. To coordinate outreach efforts avoid duplication identify gaps and leverage resources. Since establishing the CCC we have worked hand in hand with all of our partners county of Los Angeles the city of Long Beach California community foundation Los Angeles unified school district colleges universities businesses and blossom. To launch a comprehensive and coordinated outreach campaign in the city of Los Angeles that aligns with the states Richard Fritz. As this twenty twenty census approaches the city of Los Angeles will be focusing its work in six areas. One recruiting training and deploying a legion of volunteers who you're calling senses goodwill ambassadors that are themselves considered hard to count our volunteers will lead peer to peer out reach by organizing and hosting events within their networks and neighborhoods at census action kiosks and during our get out the count canvassing efforts. We had a goal of recruiting four hundred census goodwill ambassadors and I'm happy to report that we have already exceeded that goal. To date we have recruited and trained six hundred and seventy nine volunteers. Through more than twenty training sessions across the city. Thanks to the generous support of the Roth family foundation and the mayor's fund for Los Angeles we have been able to provide volunteer appreciation gift to volunteers. And many grants to organizations which I believe has helped to boost turnout at a recruitment and training events. Our program is currently on hiatus for the holidays but will resume after the start of the new year. To establishing census action kiosks in city facilities where people can comfortably and securely fill out their census questionnaire. We have identified a total of one hundred ninety five potential CAC locations in this in city facilities and nine hundred over nine hundred have been identified county wide. Thanks to the partnership that we have with the county of Los Angeles the city of Long Beach and our community partners. The city of Los Angeles is currently in conversations with the California complete count office and the county of Los Angeles. To ensure we can provide support to the state as the rollout the questioner system centers in question suspense kiosk guidance. On a parallel track we're working with our city departments to conduct a readiness assessment in anticipation of these guidelines. Depending on the outcome of those guidelines we may need additional funding to maintain the scope of our county wide program. Three leveraging the city's infrastructure by disseminating information through city department programs and services and placing localised advertisements on city owned assets. Such as street polls buses sanitation trucks out and outdoor digital billboards. A few of those departmental highlights include. The department of water and power is going to be printing census twenty twenty messages on envelopes that will be sent to one point six million households. And bill do this twice during the self response period. Our sanitation department will play census twenty twenty posters. On their fleet of refuse collection trucks. Our workforce development department is working with the bureau to conduct recruitment events and they've held fourteen. Up to date. A street lighting is gonna be placing five hundred and seventy five signs in St polls that are going to be located in hard to count neighborhoods. Transportation department is placing ads on the bus tales and videos messages inside local buses. Are information technology agency will be adding a recorded census twenty twenty message from the mayor for all calls to the city instead of hold music reaching approximately seven hundred fifty thousand people. And our three one one telephone operators will ask callers if they have completed the census during the response period and if they need help will direct them to additional information reaching approximately one hundred twenty five thousand people. Supporting an for supporting and fostering on the ground out reach efforts by community organizations via the Los Angeles census fund. A grant making program administered by the California community foundation designed to fund CBO's conducting on the ground out reach efforts in the city of Los Angeles. Five promoting enumerator recruitment by amplifying and supplementing the federal government's. Efforts via targeted Meryl and departmental communications. Six conducting direct out reach to historically under counted populations and geographies by attending and hosting outreach events. A non gap area is engaging our residents experiencing homelessness what we are working closely with the Los Angeles services homeless authority. And county of Los Angeles to reach this population additional funds could make this effort much more effective. To support these program areas we maintain a website senses that alley city dot org provide language access in twelve non English languages and support ADA accessibility. The infrastructure we've developed and the partnerships we formed over the last two and a half years has made it possible for us to create a multi pronged. Multi faceted outreach strategy which have shared with you today. I look forward to continuing to work with our partners and with the state to achieve a full count of our residents. This concludes my remarks I'm available to answer any questions you may have thank you. Thank you Mister Jackson city Long Beach. Yes good morning chairman number in German pan in German Berman and members of the committee- it is- my honor distinct honor to be able to present information about how we're working toward the successful senses here in Long Beach in the city of Long Beach- I wanna begin. My testimony by providing some background about how we're working as a city in as a community a collaborative fashion to- manager which was successful senses. Stern long beach- we have undergone an intensive- collaborative planning process develop an integrated strategic and implement implementation plans with members of our local complete count committee. And making sure- that our plans are in alignment with the goals and objectives of the federal state and county partners- the lobbies can completely out committee. Is co chaired by the city and the Long Beach unified school district includes a diverse cross section of local leaders representing educational institutions. All of them here in Long Beach hospitals and clinics- committee of Bates Bates organizations businesses and our local transit. Health workforce development agencies are I'd like to point out that over the past five months. The goal of the- committee has been to build effective partnership in effect a partnership among all our member organizations. Are considering what each organization I can do to build- can contribute individually while also capitalizing on the synergy bring- caring leaders together- in our community to understand- the importance of a collaborative effort. So one of the first- and- I would think when the most valuable- accomplishments of our community as we have worked together collectively. Is to the adoptee- guiding C. set of guiding principles- to direct our planning and outreach efforts including commitments to- want to count everyone to- focus of course on- hard to count communities. And nurture a local- work force and finally for to implement our plan our plan strategically. Today I'd like to just- share some brief highlights- about the city's plans and for census out reach using these four guiding principles. So to count everyone I think our efforts began with a commitment to- holistic approach- in- investing the necessary resources to reach our entire community. To that end in addition to being the primary- committed to being a primary convener. Of over fifty different organizations and complete a locally based complete count committee- we have committed- five hundred forty thousand dollars. Of from our own general fund since twenty eighteen and leveraging obviously the- state funding an amount of three hundred twenty two thousand dollars- subcontract with our partners at LA county. The one of our primary- activities to conduct out reach to a variety of communications. Media including digital print radio and television- as the main commuter of the complete count committee we have become the center. Of the committee's communication strategies. And we are and that is working very effectively force we're happy about the progress that we're making one that. A to be able to support all of our partners we're particularly proud of- the outreach plants that have been submitted and- are actively under way with twenty of our twenty three city departments. We have stepped up to offer their visibility throughout the community- interacting with the public. As a platform for communicating important messages about the senses. The key highlights include. Strong engages with our city libraries parks facilities in advance and working with our public works department- to brand physicalist infrastructure throughout the community. Engage our utility departments to send messages to our utility bills. In addition- we're very fortunate to have a partnership with the Long Beach unified school district- you'll hear from. Later on a different panel- it's providing us with a unique opportunity for broad based region gauge meant give it C. Y. footprint. So to focus in on hard to count populations is the essential foundation of- the city Andy committee strategy for have a successful census. And that that's it's based on grassroots out reach via trusted messengers and hard to count- areas. As the primary building block of our approach. So we're working with- committee based in faith based organizations that provide support and then- is part of our- complete count committee. And we're doing a number of other things like- we are in the process of developing protocol for recruiting and training- at least five high volunteer investors who. In other- active civic organizations will be out in the community of providing information about the senses. We've identified a hundred twenty locations- process actually he asked the question- assistance centers geographically concentrated. In hard to count areas we also are- taking steps to engage our local ethnic media as a foundational. Style element of our approach- I want to point out- that we are in a unique position to be have one of our three. Cities in California have led to its own health department so we are leveraging- the capacity of our health department through the community services. To relationships with our hard account communities including but not limited to strategic planning of our language access program. Comprehensive engagement with our Housing Authority tended in real property or communities. Engagement of our- early childhood education partners and- the Long Beach immigrant rights coalition. Additionally we're. Utilizing are we gonna be level leveraging our- homeless services infrastructure to partner with the census bureau to ensure an effective- account of our children and children homeless population- we are really- another a key aspect of our strategy- where we've identified activities. Is to have neighborhood based- community outreach and so we have of the fortunate opportunity to have. An alumni network of seven fifty neighborhood leaders who went to our neighbor leadership program. And we will be reaching out to them to use them as a foundation for- building our neighborhood outreach strategies. Hard to calculus and beyond. On and I just wanna quickly point out- the third- principle that's dried our efforts is to nurture a- local searches work force- couple things were doing their our workforce development agency here with the city Pacific gateway workforce investment- the workforce investment network. Is a direct actively- conducting our reach the pools of potential census workers- that process to provide required skills- to attain jobs with the senses the- in addition they are collaborating with the- Long Beach complete count committee members. Vertically committee based organizations develop shared messaging our strategies. And we expect that they will be co hosting recruitment events at different locations across the city. We're working with the census bureau- two provides the Philly space- for training and recruitment activities- and then finally I like to. Just highlight a couple things. At the close about how we work is strategically- we fully expect that our committee- will be using sort to identify populations in locations for rappers rapid deployment. Of resources during issuers- and non response follow periods. And our model our collaborative model has been centered around- building a foundation to the planning process but as we move it to if you don't have time will move it. To the taste faced. A that we will continue to bill. The capacities of all our member organizations add additional more member organizations to assess- without reach as we move forward and collecting data and analyze the data to sort we'll be able to be strategic and noble. To deploy resources were needed throughout the effort- and finally- we're proud of all the work excellent let me what we come back to a little later during the- period we were asking questions so. Already if you want to just give us one quick paragraph that be great. I think- I think that about sums it up for a you know everything's going on Long Beach I think- you know if I'm if I could point out that. If there are some strategic opportunities for some additional resources- we would look forward to having- some additional support for technology Tallassee computers to support our senses acting kiosk. And a questionnaire systems centers I in addition to but potentially some additional resources to support support CBO out reach with rapid response in Michael targeting- it it it and finally- communications- support with- paid advertising. At a high blood level here in Long Beach thank you Sir. Our next- miss Molly Nicholson of public information officers seat from. The representative C. O. of county of orange thank you he says because of. Good afternoon center doesn't simply members I'm all my name is Molly Nicholson on public information manager with the county of orange first and foremost I want to thank you all for the opportunity dresses committee and inform the public of the census outreach efforts in the county of orange. The county released its request for proposals looking and for trust messengers provide census out reach. In the form of canvassing and other person person strategies. The county with the approval of our ad hoc senses advisory committee consisting of two members of the borders of our board of supervisors. They get a fifty percent. Of our budget a two grassroots efforts as it's been identified as the most effective strategy. To motivate hard to count residents by the California we count office and various stakeholders. The board of supervisors are expected to consider these contracts at our next board of supervisors meeting. Should the board of supervisors approved the contracts for grassroots advocacy efforts. County stubble me with each contractor to identify and schedule outreach activities. Our priority our priority with the our grassroots advocacy vendors is to ensure all resources are deployed in hard account census tracks and block groups. Usually the county will be placing a strong emphasis on collaboration with other senses partners across Orange County. As a part of the county's canvassing efforts are contractors will be encouraging hard account committee members to participate in the census by explaining the benefits to the committee with messages that are tailored and targeted to encourage participation. Contractors will be collecting pledges raising awareness about the resources such as question- questionnaire assistance centers and phone systems language lines. The county will be establishing question question at assistance centers in county facilities which will include- C. public libraries county warned social service offices and family resource centers as well as- as well as creation of Q. a season non county on sites. You a C. is will serve as an important purpose in creating greater accessibility the centers will make the census accessible to all committee members welcome Robert reminding residents of the importance of competing in the twenty twenty seven census questionnaire. Using a contracted media public work using our contract the public will public relations firm the county will be crafting regional messaging to complement the state's campaign. In addition to building in unified messaging and branding that will be available to all partners the county's public relations vendor in conjunction with our county seat your communications department will help create earned media efforts while working with the outreach court contractors to provide coordinated media support. The county's canvassing efforts. The county is also courting with terrible ventures of Orange County and the C. department- department of education to ensure broader collaboration- for census offerts. These efforts have been supported by the with the leadership in input by- congressman the crass offices well senators on Tom Burke's office we greatly appreciate all the assistance from Orange County delegations and in regard to our efforts. The county of orange will be holding a coronation meeting scheduled for early next year early next year with all contracted partners will be working in region nine. Additionally this group identified the need to meet more regularly beginning in twenty twenty and found opportunities to share resources such as training capabilities. The county warns appreciates the funding from the state of California and the support of our congressional state locations in order to child achieve a complete count in Orange County. Using the funding provided by the state legislature in conjunction with the California complete count office. The county will be coordinating a multi pronged effort to engage residents through through in person contacts digital and print media. And trusted messengers in a carefully coordinated multi touch model that we believe will motivate all hard to count residents to complete. Complete the twenty twenty census. Again thank you for the opportunity to look forward to working with our partners to ensure we have a successful senses out reaching effort and the virgin nine. Thank you Mister Wilson- next miss daisy press city of Santana. Good afternoon senator Umberg and committee members my name is daisy Prez and I am the lead for the census for the city of Santana. The city of Santana has the most hard to count census tracts of all of Orange County. As a result the city has prioritized census outrage as one of our major initiatives for the twenty nineteen twenty twenty fiscal year. In twenty minutes early twenty nineteen the city formed our own complete count committee which includes members of various stakeholders. Including the Santa Ana unified school district Santa Ana college. And nonprofit organizations that have collaborated together on these efforts. Are complete count committee members came together to create a partnership video with trusted voices from the city as well as state and federal government. Leaders that highlight the importance of the twenty twenty cents. We strategically played the video to a captive audience of over ten thousand residents before the headliners performance at our largest community event of the year. Yes the spot yes. At the same community event members of the Santa Ana complete count committee participated in a parade that had thousands of spectators. Members of all ages March down the streets of Santa Ana and solidarity displaying Santa Ana accounts and make it count T. shirts down the route. Since June city staff and members of our complete count committee have also conducted out reach other countless community events of all levels including small scale neighborhood events. To large scale regional efforts. Since June two thousand nineteen we've anticipated we've already reached sixty thousand members of our community. Through the leadership of the Santa Ana city council the city has stepped up and allocated our own resources to fund these efforts. To that end our city council has allocated a hundred and twenty five thousand dollars from our general fund. Towards this. This funding we have developed a robust digital marketing campaign as well as funding for census ambassadors and direct outreach. As a city wide priority we have also activated resources from other departments to expand our reach. One of those internal partners is our library department. In partnership with the US census bureau and library staff we are conducting twelve informational workshops in English Spanish Vietnamese throughout the month of January and February of next year. In addition we have prioritized our funding to help bridge the digital divide by perching purchasing additional wifi hot spots that are available to be checked out our library. We hope that resources like this will help families complete the census from the comfort of their home if they so choose. Another key internal partner is our water division. We're working together in a joint campaign titled make it count to conduct additional outreach efforts. With their support we are not just adding census messaging to our- water bills. But we've also developed a calendar that will be mailed out to all households in the city. And this will have information on key dates from the senses as well of as well as other key information for our city. And we're also working with our- water department and our economic development division to conduct direct outreach to our restaurants and businesses- they've developed several materials for the children of those restaurants. I was well as for the general patrons as well. Moving forward we're going to continue to work with our trusted- with our stakeholders and trusted partners to promote the importance of the twenty twenty census to ensure. That everyone in Santa Anna's counted. One of the city's biggest assets are sixty four active neighborhood associations and we will be working with our local neighborhood leaders to conduct. Local outreach throughout the next year. We are planning to conduct a series of community block parties and community walks and several of our her two count communities in the city. Through funding that we are anticipating to receive from the county of orange. However we were recently notified that we will no longer be receiving this funding I will have to significantly reduce our outreach efforts alas additional. Dollars are received. Nonetheless we will continue to prioritize the twenty twenty census moving forward. That concludes my presentation and I am available to answer any questions thank you mistress of. Before I turn it over to my colleagues for their questions let me just point out three areas I'm gonna ask about giving up to think about- while others are asking their questions our first I'm gonna ask each of you what additional resources you may have contributed to the effort I a note this Long Beach and Senate has already identified some additional resources but- like this east each of you. What additional resources are being contributed- what metrics are performance measures you're you're using so for example- I recall that. Misa de ellos a Garcia said that a goal of four hundred goodwill ambassadors you've exceeded- wondering what other metrics each of you are using performance measure using. And then what challenges what your greatest challenge. May be separate apart from funding. We assume that that everyone needs additional resources. And so let me. Turn it over to assembly member Berman since you're out numbered four to one here I thought maybe I didn't. That opportunity to ask questions they thank you senator Umberg it's considered there twice as many as family members and senators- I commend the Senate. On your participation in today's hearing- and such little we're always were much more engaged in the assembly it's a it's a you know I yeah I can't I. Can't we care more I can't argue with the obvious okay are you there may there are those right so- so couple you mentioned that you're hiring commuting back are not hiring the recruiting volunteer community ambassadors- to participate- center Amberg reference a second ago. Our I guess the question is are any of those ambassadors also applying to be raiders or helping in the Newman. Recruitment could I know that's an area that were falling short across the state. Then and then a lot. Of folks reference the questionnaire assistance centers. He asked and different plans that you have an identifying locations for those how are those locations are gonna be advertised to your residence to make sure that they know where they can go or is the hope that they're just so- you know it the spread out everywhere that people are will bump into them without even meaning to- which would be a good thing and I should say I was really happy to hear a lot about some of the- the kind of PR efforts that folks are doing whether it was garbage trucks or- lampposts or other things because my hope is that. You know we count I count signs are so ubiquitous across California that everyone just feels like it's something that everyone else is doing and that there's no risk to it so it sounds like a lot of folks. Creative ideas to make that happen. I can answer the question I have for LA county in regards to the census action kiosk and kind of how. How we plan to advertise and- early on in the process of. I. LA county with our colleagues the valley we agreed that we would develop a CAC locator tool that would be able to push out so that people can. Find the closest Q. a C. will also make sure that we provide that information to our two one one line we anticipate that people are going to have questions about the census and I got a call two one one so we have to. Make sure that they're prepared- it also Ted make sure that that line that assistance is provided in language. It also be something that we according to our media campaign but we did think about that we did want to have one central place where people can find those. Locations red. And for the city of Los Angeles. This in terms of the ambassadors and how. Are they learning about the enumerator jobs that are available with the US census bureau. We have invited the US census bureau to table at. All of our senses a recruitment and training events and if they have gladly accepted each of those opportunities- we also provide the- opportunity to make a page before and after trainings. So they are well integrated into our program. As far as promoting this census action kiosk located within the city of Los Angeles we are in addition to working with the county of Los Angeles to. Create the locator tool we're also gonna be utilizing our senses goodwill ambassadors during the non response follow up period and are canvassing get out the count efforts. To inform local residents about the census action kiosks around their neighborhood so that. They know where to go where in. If they do not have access to a internet ready device either computer tablet or phone. Or just feel more comfortable going to a location where they might be able to obtain language assistance or digital literacy assistance. I and then finally we're gonna be incorporated senses. Kiosk messages into our advertising campaign so that they'll be the messages where a we are specifically promoting the census action kiosks and how to access the locator tool. So on one beach we are also going to be using- the locator tool- we're going to for marketing or chaos but in addition to that incorporating information about our kiosk in- all our multi media outreach efforts- digital- print- and so forth but I think what's going to be most effective for us in marketing are and- our kiosk is all the direct out reach with- are masters- beat out in the community. And hopefully our neighborhood leaders- dispersed throughout the city- that have existing relationships with the communities- that those- chaos will be in I think the school district is going to provide us a really good opportunity- to because they're contributing- several of the- the kiosk to their relationships to- directly market those- the kiosks in terms of. Promoting the census jobs- we are certainly- directing- that- messaging towards our ambassadors- and in a and then also to- we're actually also thinking about the idea of providing that information to our city employees who. Might be looking for other opportunities as well. So yeah. Thanks. So the county of orange is actually working- in conjunction with the- US census bureau in relation to working to get enumerators so we've been advertising in our county publications your HR rep- avenues some on Arlington pages on all the social media outlets to ensure that there is a good deal of coverage in relation that- obviously also made a pitch to our county employees or internal publication stern sure there may be some part time opportunities for them to come in New as a numerators if they have any colleagues or friends are such that might be looking for positions. So we work very closely with our our colleagues there as far as- the queue a season such obviously were were- curing up in relation to that to actually launch that into our family resource centers are libraries and such but there will be a very much a big courted offered once we do get off the ground and get approval for our grassroots efforts will be working with our vendors to actually launch that to make sure we publicize and be working very closely with the CEO communication office my office in particular. I'm sure we have a great deal of coverage as far as communications concerned. The bulk of the queue a season the city of Santana will be placed our community centers throughout the city. As well as additional- government buildings we will be placing this information and our community resource guides and recreation pressures that go out- to all of our household who'll be. Also placing this information online- regarding the census jobs and our ambassador program so most of our senses ambassadors are actually our neighborhood association leaders- and some of those already have full time jobs but we are inviting and we have invited in the past the US census bureau. I'm too common table with us at events and those have been very successful thus far. Thank you. Thank you seven member Berman center the Russell. Thank you very much I just want to follow up on the issue of the hiring of enumerators- it seems to me there's some effort but I'm not quite sure. How formal and how big of a of an effort how big of a push it is to use all of our resources to make sure we hire- that's what we referring to right we say enumerators they're the full time- ambassadors are more the volunteers. Right just just to be clear on the on the terms so just in terms of the LA county- you mentioned- a little bit about maybe using a human resources but- is that possible to use it in a much more direct. All full way- the way some of the other- departments are being used I know department social services I think you- was mentioned that- you can use the full scope of the of the agency so can't you made resources or maybe the registrar of voters be used in a much more forceful complete way to find. Enumerator enumerator applicants. And overall just can we use. Of current resources right now to get the most number of enumerators. So in my in my remarks senator I mentioned that- our county department we'd axis currently coordinating six events but what I didn't say is then just start in December it had actually see I have previous events to existing kind of events we've been in including census I. jobs messaging that's part of it. The other part is kind of making connections with those applicants that come through our county- either contractors or through our departments to make that connection with jobs making sure that we push those messages out- another component of that is also a media strategy including our- websites as well as pushing out to social media. That's just a piece or a component of it and the other part that we're asking our departments I had to do was to come up with kind of unique areas that we can push it out whether it's through partnerships with our cities but also with our and with our county departments. So it's not just I know I mentioned the six events happening but this I want to make it clear that it's been happening over the past kind of. Six months. And do you do you. Have any way of gauging do we have. Sufficient are we meeting some are there some the goal. As far as the number to be hired I know you don't do the hiring but- I do you have any way of gauging are we where we need to be. In order to reach. So many hard to count Bob I think that's kind of the difficulty for LA county is one of the things that we're doing and we have a meeting scheduled with. The US census bureau to kind of see how we could be more helpful to kind of. Hit those targets we know what their goal is we know that there are 30% of their hiring goal. But I think that's kind of where the partnership with the US census bureau would come in so that we can kind of. Develop some metrics in each of. The past. Okay yes and one more question after you thank you okay well I can I can offer some comments about that- the in order to recruitment we are- specifically are having gazed are- workforce development agency Pacific gateway- to- develop an excuse tragedies to in partnership with the census bureau- to help out with the numerator recruitment we are actively working with assisted payroll to identify training recruitment space in our city facilities to host events- in partnership with the bureau- our workforce development agencies acts is actively- analyzing pools of existing- job seekers- within their current network- it for potential- employer. Is between toys for the senses that they can actually train and referred to the bureau for jobs. So that is sort of the primary way that we're doing our recruitment for- at the numerators in the city of Long Beach. It's one more one more question is of we all know that this environment- that our immigrant communities whether. Citizens or legal residents run document doesn't really matter you know our in the- a- mixed emotions about how to how much to trust government- we had an issue with our D. M. V. and the sharing of information so. Can you just tell me I know that's not your sole responsibility we have a media and communications- part of the strategy but how do you especially Los Angeles county. And Orange County how do you sort of see our response or- our communications are out there to up to the issue of. Immigration status- or our communities to feel secure and confident to up participate. I can address this at least in terms of addressing it when I dressed our county departments what I what I had text expressed our county departments is- the state of California in LA county specifically has shown to our undocumented immigrant populations that were there to support them they've- we've created the LA justice find out in partnership with the city of LA- additionally the board of supervisors created the office of immigrant affairs so I feel even though we talk about trust messengers often we're talking about. CBO's I would argue that and the county- it's also county departments it's where they go whether it's through the library they take their children there after it's our health department so I think we're cooperating a lot of that message Jean and our touches- and that is. Tied into our I. county wide campaign the other component for us- we also have our office of M. good affairs who who's kind of messaging these to the various- CBO's that we work with and also that's what we're going to hear from anyone if we start to kind of hear misinformation they're going to come to our office. And I'm gonna fairs and hopefully we can take that message and work with our partners whether it's with the city or with C. CF to kind of develop that and I think that's where the collaborations gonna be especially once we get to the non response fallible be hearing some of those things and partner. From from the community along as well as with the state I think that's where for us it's going to be key is coordinating our messaging not only with you know our cities with C. CF as as well as the states about world coordinate in that regard. No just add on the in the city of Los Angeles in just reiterate as well. That we recently held a briefing for the consular corps in Los Angeles- to brief them. On the county wide efforts happening here in Los Angeles and- get. Their enlistment to help with out reach especially with nationals that go and seek services. To their consulates- directly. We're also. Working with our senses goodwill ambassadors and a- great many deliver them- don't have citizenship status and that's because we've made. The requirements to be a CGA very flexible the only requirement. Is to be. Los Angeles. To have the event in the city of Los Angeles and to be eighteen years and older. So again citizenship status or status in the US is not a requirement to be a census goodwill ambassador- and we have been able to do that- through the- a private funds that we've received through the foundation. Out in also up to- piggy back on the point of young was making is that- utilizing. Our infrastructure both in the- county of Los Angeles and in the city where we have the mayor's office of immigrant affairs. That works directly with community based organizations that service immigrant populations. Out and we've worked very closely with some of the states a statewide contracted partners like cheap Lara. And the label to hold. Out reach advanced to immigrant communities to begin putting out messaging. Around the importance of participating in being counted in the twenty twenty census. Yes I'll I'll just have to do our our department of health office equity- we do have strong relationships with- the immigrant and- and document community- and particularly with the Long Beach Long Beach immigrant rights coalition- we over the last- couple years we've been actively working. With those organizations- with a couple outcomes with stops to Long Beach justice fun. On the Long Beach values axle the strength of our relationship with and the immigrant community- are- are very very good- another key indicator of how we're working with our immediate community. They are actually a part of our complete count committee and they- are actively working with us M. proposing activities to help us. Get the trusted messages out into the community- so we have a really good opportunity to our office equity and the work we're doing with immigrant relations. In an office. I mean working for the government obviously know that sometimes people are are of little hesitant to talk to county governments are city governments especially you know with county governments you deal with us on sometimes on your worst days- but there's also. You're dealing with a summons up making great relationships particular with our family resource centers are social workers and such along those lines that are more of our trusted messenger so we're looking to leverage. Those relationships that some of our our constituents have with some of our of our folks that are actually in the community helping provide services and such. But the trusted messenger component is very important as well and we understand that that's going to be the way that way in- they how those relationships there fomented them over the years they've there's now a trusted component there. So we're very cognizant of where our weaknesses are as far as doing the outreach and the and the communication would differ constituencies. So the county is working to leverage all of our grassroots advocacy components that are actually in the community that are seen as trusted messengers to help- advocate and make sure that these folks that are in those hard account areas. Fill out their census forms. The city of Santana has identified this as a tremendous challenge since the beginning of our efforts. As a sanctuary city we have a century advisory round table- that has come together. And we are taking advantage of these community partners- and there were working with them and with our Mexican consulate's office- to come up with additional messaging have a specifically targeting- the myths regarding the citizenship question. That was up there because some folks still think it's going to be on there. And also just- reiterating that their data safe- as you mentioned the- incident that happened with the DMV didn't help our case- so we're gonna all. Just continue to move that message forward. And we've been working with staff from the county of orange to come up with a joint- info graphic on that we can display throughout the entire county. Just indicating what happens to your data once you respond to the census. And that they can see that on this will not be able to come back and be tracked to them. We're hoping that that will be helpful and we'll have that in a series of languages as well. Thank you Senate also center pan. Thanks very much us our number you know I think all the presenters I know that the amount of time we give you. I was not in that's really tough to. Cover everything you're doing and- so- but- I. Think the idea was to get the highlights and certainly any material can send us about some other activities is always welcome- first a couple comments and then a couple questions- so first of all- children her when the group's that's- hard to count- some hoping that in the messaging that's going out to everyone I know people working with we came from schools in the first five and so forth. But also just kind reminding people that if there's children household the need to count them right now they need so. Hopefully that's part of the regular messaging and also given some people. Some guidance as to the house basically just remember you know you just you can yourself but you also need to. There's kids in the household sure you. But the man they're all the kids. Right the other thing is I know that many of you mentioned- you know you're safe secure a season so for them hoping that- the state folks that we can actually- and you'd mentioned you have a- locator. App I'm hoping that were everyone's entree develop their own. Maybe we can the state should do that and we have a statewide database of all the curious use and so forth so anyone who's wherever they are could actually. Intentionally pull up and out and find it I know many people use mobile in people who do have access often be. Particular income just need to have mobile that honestly have desktop or something so. Again trying to be sure that that that information's easily- obtained in this M. the symbol. A couple questions. First is about language access- you'll for the API community particular but also for many other communities language is an issue. We know there's several languages that are you know in the part of the census program and the senses of. I guess what I'm asking and ask about is the ones that aren't. Right you know the ones that are the top five or even the top ten. Okay and we're talking with the hard to count so- and- so what is being done to reach out to communities were speaking. I would say fairly rare languages okay. And trying to figure out how do we get to those communities- some of them de languages may not necessarily. Really have a written form it's merely or all other types of things so you're not going to hit him in mass media. They may not they may or may not be in social media out there or not going to be hit but the- you know that they're not want. Qualified census languages. What are you doing to try to help and they may not necessarily. Cluster all in one geographic area either to be scattered. In you know and obviously- L. A.'s certainly a melting well the salad over some feeling multi pot. Garden salad of you know only rightly cultures. So can Jean maybe speak to particularly languages that are. Fairly infrequent that are not the main which is are the top five that you're what were you doing to reach. Out to those communities and provided language support. Suffer the LA county most of what we're you know we're contracting two thirds of that so we're working with the cities to meet that but what we looked at internally I mean one of the reasons we have so many Q. A. seizing and Q. eight cases. We don't know if people are gonna be driven there so we're trying to cover all the places that they potentially will be. And to cover all those languages like we're trying to look where we have county staff who speak that language for example our department public social service but there's a big gap so one of the things that we looked at is- contracting with the language line this is. A service that is used in our health centers in our public health centers to offer that translation service which would go beyond the threshold languages. So that is kind of a resource because for us I think it's- in terms of value in kind of the dollars that we have limited. It is- what we're looking for that's kind of how the LA county is going to be addressing it at some of our Connie locations. On the other thing I just wanted to mention because we talked about the CAC locator tool. I did want to say obviously our locations are gonna be uploaded into sword so that would be what information if we're not going to just do our own thing and then. I'm not have that information available statewide so I just wanted to clarify that. The other thing in and understanding that is really important for us to go where people are. Here at the county what we're looking at is also- developing mobile kiosk where we would actually go J. events so what we're doing between January through the end of the response rate or working with all our county departments. Our board office is to identify kind of the locations were hard. Counter. Where do we already have. A presence. And what can we go to. Because I think that it's going to be key. Is reaching out to them where they're at not necessarily hoping that we drive them to our libraries are drive into health clinics. The idea is. When they're there. We can make a contact engage maybe engagement courage and Kerr Jim to fill out the census that is one way. Really we realize that we have to also complement that with going out to where they're at. And for the city of Los Angeles I think M. were really taking this as part of a three pronged strategy one. Is by- this is where our partnership with the Los Angeles regional census table is really. Going to be critical because- I will be promoting all of the partner hot lines that have- them in operation during the- activation period in making sure that- if somebody needs to be. Directed to a particular language line where they do have that language expertise that we're promoting- that hotline- we're also going to be- including. The link which guides that have been developed by the US census bureau and fifty nine different languages- in our- questioner. In our senses action kiosk locations and providing them an outreach events that we attend. There's more to Steven languages in LA right. Yes yes. I and then we are also through our- senses goodwill ambassadors programs does since is good with a masters that. Speak unique languages- we're gonna be tapping them to. Have them lead- events where they are the trusted messenger in about and ambassador to their community- to. Inform people of the twenty twenty census in their language. So we currently have a language access program that provides interpretation and- translation services for- for any language- if you will with the core. Language is being- comite to Golic- in Spanish- or the principal languages- that are of concern to our community. The comite is of particular concern to us- because is not one of the primary our priority languages. And Long Beach has a significant Cambodian population. So we are prioritizing resources to make sure that- we do you know direct out reach out to that segment of our community- through ethnic media outlets we have one here- and- working with arc Cambodian community to assist with. I think you. Just doesn't brief follow up so you could you a large committee population in Long Beach. Is obviously M. does other Cambodia populations across the state- is there any conversation again we see people haven't had a chance to talk yet but- to take okay well since. Long Beach has a large committee population develop materials whatever out reach that that's that available to other places that may not have larger they have me a small. Cambodian populations but may not because they're smaller don't have this many resources to so like are we to exchanging or trading information with other. Places so I would imagine Long Beach by take the lead on the Cambodian population. Yeah absolutely we are certainly willing to do that I'm not aware of any contact that we've had with any other communities in that regard but however. On it's a very good point- we were very well resource that area and so we would be willing to offer our support okay what so that I think that would be so hopefully some there be a conversation. About that because at. In for example I know that- some of the- of Pacific Islander population I guess represents what point 4% I saw in the- thing- you know like Samoan vis a fourth. Out so who's gonna develop the materials for that and do we need every hello this every single county develop their own or can we find a way to. Where there's local areas that may have a larger community where they may have be able to because they have. Those relationships than help use those materials that can help other places than say well we don't have as much of a- you know relationship or the committee's much smaller commuter area but then we have materials we can use our our our- you know. Advice they can give to do that so hopefully we're creating some sort of learning collaborative or something about that- for and in in date. I believe in and maybe the sticking cracked me later that I think part of that is Steve Craig partner portal would be able to share some of those materials that probably would be a good resource for us collectively. And share. The material look at the same yes I think the. That was the intention of that I think. I think you and I the deadline the electorate's county yeah colleagues as well thank you senator pan- obviously at working as a communicator in the in the county of orange and the need to have things translated in multiple languages or is incredibly important- within the county itself we obvious people of speak Farsi Spiegel different types of Chinese. Commands the other one we do have a Cambodian population as well so we would love to have that support we do have interpreters are on staff whether they be work for the social services agency and have translation components we have an outside translating- service that we actually have at the county- the big the most important thing for me is obvious I'm getting it right and writing but for people there on the ground. That they have those cultural norms cyclical sensitivities to actually communicate effectively is gonna be the most important thing so as you can imagine I am not gonna be an expert on understanding all the cultural norms and subsidies ages whatever whatever needs to occur. But I want to insure as as whatever documents we get are are done correctly and- looked over in message tested and such on those lines so any resources we have the hive mind the that their communities and such would be great as you can imagine even the different- constituencies across it. From so as well so we would love to have that support and we look to see what we can do to ensure that the messaging is done effectively. The city of Santana has access to translation services in Spanish and Vietnamese when we need access to census material in other languages. We have reached out to our partners at the county of orange- but it that is for some of those common languages like Chinese husband really hopeful that materials that we- receive from them. In that language- but to echo Molly's comment that would be great if the state prioritized. You know. Bob putting out information that any city or county could use- in multiple language in that way we can ensure that state wide we have a clear and consistent message. Okay no I did have a second question boma turned to a comments of a question because I know we need to move on up. The others that I guess. Question or comment I was gonna say is that. As we're moving along. I just know how organizations work in this Friday also question of him for the for are coming and give to our non profits are presenting next. Oftentimes is especially with a deadline were barreling along we need to get this done we tend to go to our usual partners. Right there the people are used to working with the people we have a relationship with and that's great and we need to work with them- but I also- asset we also especially since we saw several few months hueso Hundred Days to think about the people we don't normally partner with are the people who we have and there might be different reasons that might happen over time or something- but- you know. But they're also representing groups of people who then what happens may not be as touched rate because we're so. I just ask that we reflect on the. If we just wait for the people who were used to coming and they come to the table but we're not looking like we're the empty seats are. People having come to the table so I think this is a good time now the server reflected. Who is it that's out there that's not here. You might have had even a bad experience with them before this. You know let it and say well. Do you need to rethink that especially for the census so I'm just gonna throw that out there. I'm sure you're doing all the out reach you can- but I just want people to think about that because those are the places where gaps could occur as well. And then it's harder it takes more work because these are people who used. To you. You know all this I have an existing relationship with. Thank you. I'm thank you Senate pan. And we ought to put a- pin in it so to speak. M. went when miss Katagiri testifies will later on. That's a great question about. Coordination of resources you know using the combined language as a- an example there other places and- in the states and Hannah for example. That has a large sum of my speakers and so. We should be. Making sure that we- have some economies of scale here all right. Before we turn to Senate Gonzalez- and I know that the every question that was asked. Every member of the panel feels an obligation to respond I promise not to hold against you if you don't need to respond to every question- if you want to contribute that's wonderful but but you should not feel compelled. To contribute on the on each question and that will apply to. Later panels as well. RT senators aus. Thank you this is been a great discussion so far so thank you all again- so again I a thinker reiterate a lot of- what my colleagues to talk about in terms of this year to three population- and I didn't see and maybe I. Just skipped over this my head but early education sites. Are we thinking about a strategy to tackle you know the preschoolers. And also even I was just at Saint Mary's- and looking at the maternal sites and- you know- Lumos classes or is their strategy for that because I think that's where even if you're pregnant they're still someone that's coming. Along that sometimes often is not counted mothers are not thinking about counting them. I can speak to that so I believe it was. Maybe two weeks ago- incarnation with. The LA county office of education first five we help her. Kind of first convening of all the various partners and I think those are some of the strategies that were- kind of. Included but were supposed to have a follow up meeting in January second take some of those comments and feedback to make sure that we include those populations but- what we did for this initial meeting was for all these groups to kind of get in a room and share what they're doing whether it's in the spree schools whether it's in schools are like- so that we had that. One conversation so I can take that back to our next meeting which is scheduled for. January no that our colleagues from on. LA county office of education a touch on that too but we will take that back to make sure. Great thank you and then the only other question is- similar to a doctor pan mentioned about- people we don't often think about collaborating with. But I would even look at how we can leverage private support you know some of our larger corporations. Both on the funding side because they often have social responsibility. Opportunities where they can give to the census- initiatives and be. For their employees that could potentially volunteered become ambassadors- so I think just things to think about unless there's something you want to highlight if we're already. Working with some private industry think that could be another opportunity. I'm at all just hi late as something that we did- in partnership with Wells Fargo we trained their employees to be senses goodwill ambassadors and so- that's just one example of how we are leveraging our- partnerships. With private business. Yes on. The business local businesses a sector in our complete count committee and we've engaged a chamber with engage- our business improvement districts- but also some local business businesses as well- we have. A one example of I like to share is frontier communications. Is a city in art- our complete count committee and- they have- offered up- an opportunity to partner or one- trying to access some equipment- technology equipment. You know it's so it may not meet all our needs but we feel that that is very substantial- on a substantial contribution that they're planning to make an- and so. I felt was important highlight that one in particular. So and that's kind of part of our model and how we're working and that's why we Gaines to businesses- to have direct out reached with the business but also to cultivate opportunities for. Sharing resources and so I want to lift up that one example frontier communications. Thank you Senate themselves alright let let's just do a quick lightning round here the questions I asked earlier Wilk will just start with Mr Rebay- what what is Los Angeles county if anything contributed. Beyond what state resource provided. So some terms of resources- I think when I started we had maybe three or four staff I'm just fully assigned to census meaning. They were not given any other responsibility I think since I'm about to about maybe seven staff including our J. S. of separate this point it's been staff resources. I do think as we start to conduct some of this gap analysis on to the end of this month and we bring our cities online at the maybe. We may be looking at potentially non response follow up as kind of a an an issue that we may have to kind of the board resources but I don't wanna it's not up to me but I think just. In terms of kind of what LA county has dedicated terms of resources so is there a specific. I'm actually looking for specific dollar amount is there's specific dollar amount that the county of Los Angeles is designated- potentially yes potentially tensely yes any sense of when that might happen before April I hope. Yes before okay because I think I would like to come back and provide that but I think that the answer is yes. I just don't have that the dollar. All right city Los Angeles. The city of Los Angeles has contributed two point one million dollars since twenty seventeen. Thank you. Long Beach. I know Mr Jackson Yuri testified I think was five and forty thousand dollars is that right. Right all right county of orange. I don't have that figure but obviously can get that to you but we do have staff there obviously working on this currently and also will not be engaging our our staff from different various departments are twenty three departments across the county. Okay Senate I think you've testified but go ahead. Yes so this. City has allocated a hundred twenty five thousand dollars from our general fund. In addition- our other departments have put together about fifty thousand dollars towards this effort. And then we've allocated about staff time. So far the city has put about two hundred fifty thousand dollars towards the suffer. Already thank you. Our next question for the group lightning round it metrics- if you can. Give me just one example of a metric that you're using- pre April. That would be helpful and then then to the extent that you actually have metrics- and where you are in those metrics if you could submit them to us I would be interested in that so. Starting with county. Was sentenced so one example because it's fresh in my mind as to our media contractor we actually do have kind of metrics for kind of how we're spending those dollars whether it's like click through rate social media kind of. Facebook I think those are things that we bill ten because we know that we're going to have to kind of demonstrate our dollars and how they're they're effective so that's probably one example but I can also share other metrics that were incorporating. Within our city contracts including here with city violated a really great job of kind of Allen with their metrics as well as long beach. City Los Angeles. Out through our out reach direct outreach efforts were actually already uploading information onto the sword system that documents number of impressions that we are having out of all of our outreach events- and- I already mentioned the goal of recruiting census goodwill ambassadors we've exceeded that and- I we will also be collecting metrics from the C. D. A.'s each one of them that we train I will be expected to collect twenty five played to pledge to be counted- the and cheats from the people that they engage. And for the many grants that we give that to you organizations there- the goal is to obtain fifty so I'm just to the panels so what am I in a they may have been articulate when I say metrics actually mean performance measures so we set you know for example a goal of four hundred and we have achieved. X. towards so long which. So we work with our member of yeah organizations- to identify activities- to contribute to the towards outreach effort- and they set goals- in so we're gonna be tracking those activities in sort- to determine you know to have an example of any of those those goals and- where you might be in relation to those goals. We've we've just I. we just completed the identification for implementation plan of those activities and so- and we created the tracking mechanism now for sort. And so we haven't begun putting that information in the sort- we do have a goal a couple things I can highlight you know we have a goal to recruit five hundred senses and passengers- we know we're starting with as a starting point we're gonna be working with our seven hundred fifty neighbor leadership all. Alumni we think we- will make us not get halfway there so we we've already begun working on that- we can we reach out to our board to commission so that that's that's perfect that's what I'm looking for is we have a goal of. X. in we are keeping track to see how close were coming to that goal in our progress yes. Alright I could point out one other thing we know that we have this the bureau has a goal of hiring four thousand- enumerators your long beach. On the currently- as we understand it we're at about two thousand- and so we have a delta there and so we are using- our workforce development agency and apart all right right thank you perfect okay. Connie Warren should. We are currently are working on the establishing these goals and these metrics in relation to a because obviously the state would like are why no one where that we need to put resources as you can imagine the communications component. That'll be even more easily trackable as far as impressions of concern there's no there's no performance measures not this not the present time rhetoric and you're going to you're going to help. Us out and absolutely all right thank you Susanna. So one of our goals is to- interact with approximately three hundred. Thousand residents over the period of time. So far we've- counted about sixty thousand direct impressions. And then we're also counting how many sign ups we receive from residents to actually receive ongoing updates on the census. So far we have over a thousand emails and phone was goal. Goal we don't have a number set for that one we just are trying to get as many as we possibly can. Last lightning round question- I I'll- I'm sure you all need more resources will will assume that- but separate apart from money what's your biggest challenge. Besides time because we don't get an extension for the science right so well except that I'm for LA county at least I'm now that we have the guidelines for Q. a season sake he at. Our senses action cast in the question arcs and centers it'll be kind of rolling that out to make sure that the locations we identified meet those requirements so that is going to be a significant challenge so in light with the C. bill they were going to be doing a reading this assessment of our county locations but for us- that will be our Christmas. And new year project can make sure that our locations kind of meat that the requirements. Thank you said it was angel's direct out reach to residents experiencing homelessness given. The size and complexity of our population. Long Beach. Outside of resources I would say additional support- so much LA reaching out to our homes population. Well when Connie. The challenge is obviously just the number of the volume of folks that we actually have to touch within a relatively short time period so probably the any specific Orange County challenged. None that I can think of right original Santana. One of our challenges is to ensure that all of our households within one address are counted we have a lot of. Other folks living and I AT use or additional units within that property and just combating not just because- one of the households in the- and not. For the address was counted does not mean that everyone in the household with cabinet alright folks that don't necessarily feel that they're part of this household. We just need to make remind them that. They should be conscious teller some of our colleagues are trying to create more eighties matter fact. So a couple questions county of orange- the- city of Santa said that they're the hardest to count. The city is that right is that your estimation as well. Yes the city's a Santana as well as Anaheim would be the two hardest mathcounts cities in the in the county of orange. All right in in terms of coordination with the county Orange County part of education are you cordoning with the orange Gaines particle of education yes we are at this time. Okay and maybe offline- will last some more questions about how that coordination is going and what their plans are as well. So all right- thank you very much we appreciate your time panel- will excuse you and will call up the next panel next panel is weak count LA community our senses- and that. Will consist of the California community foundation Ephron Escovedo. Vice president Long Beach forward James water so- associate director in south east LA collaborative Cynthia Cortez associate director. So if you all come forward in in. Before you testify. That we appreciate that you probably have much more to say the than the time that is been allocated- contrary to popular perception all of us up here can read so if there's if there's something that you'd like us to consider- please feel free and I know I've asked some questions asked for some follow up information- please consider giving us additional information in writing and I'm in also informed our staff can read as well. Some all right so let's let's start with. Efron Escovedo from the California community foundation thank you Sir for being here. Thank you senator Umberg and members of the committee Senate member Berman thank you for a- representing the assembly in the house sheet that. I'm well the this morning I'd I'd like to make some brief remarks and an appreciate center that asos point about- we all know the census is important so we've been on it for two years- but where are we today on so that we could understand what she pouring going into twenty twenty and- I'm privileged and excited to share the stage with. Two very important partners of ours in in this effort which is Long Beach forward and Marcella collaborative of folks who really exemplified- the answer to that question so be sure to leave the time for them- in terms of Los Angeles county do have to say that where we're at right now is a in our sense a great spot and a lot of it is because of what. You heard from our leaders both at the county and our various key cities it's because of the trust and early coordination that we've built with the county city about laci of Long Beach and other cities that I'm we've really as administrative CBO California community foundation and our partners have had an opportunity to really free Lee and deeply focus on what is our community need to be sure we have folks who can reach folks out the door. To make sure that we've identified brick and mortars where the county can partner- with folks to be questionnaire assistance center I'm and all of that knowing that simultaneously the county was working on mobilizing every resource it had as well as the city the city's contribution into the port fun for Los Angeles was a tremendous catalyst in addition to the states of funding to also bring philanthropy to the table. So what I will share with you today that I'm. One the early investment. From your legislative Bob- the support of the governor's office and the everyday support of the of the complete count office brought significant resources to Ali eight point four million but what really has happened since then is whether public sector partners and community partners. Really working with philanthropy to have them step up and I'm happy to report that in addition to the eight point four million investment from the state we've actually augmented dot to upwards of over seventeen million dollars that all have been concentrated on get out the count efforts- in various communities and hard to count tracks in LA county. The way that we've worked early and planning has been in collaboration with key organizations that have been transformative to LA on any issue from healthcare to education to civic participation and what you see up on the slide is what we call the core of the steering committee so everything that you hear about today has been built in collaboration and partnership. With these organizations and as with these organizations have been able to then work and interact with the county as they've developed and the city as they've developed the complete count committees all these organizations play lead roles in their regions it helping to support other local complete come committees proclaim abuse for out in in the valley has helped San Fernando build a complete commit. To these the really the organizations that have built it the question of metrics has been brought up you see USC Dorrance F. and engage our Andy have been working collaboratively with organizations across the county to understand how are you measuring success we need a big sure that success it is a percentage Bates a person counted and so they're working collectively with us with the sporty in this eight to make sure that we have metrics as we start moving forward but metrics that are real- and so we're- excited to have those partnerships as well. I'm. A lot of the work that we've been doing early on. We received resources from the state in here I will underscore. That having had resources early. Has made a big difference in and you'll see this in the next couple of slides the first is we work collaboratively with our community partners and steering committee to identify what are the capacities that organizations say they need to build in order to be. Effective messengers on the census so we identified messaging media tearing digital training that's key things organizations needed beyond just bodies. And to date we launched with our partners at Fenton aid. Tool kit online tool kit that organizations where organizations can access these resources get access to trainings we've had over a thousand folks axis these tool kit so far- eight hundred and thirty three different users and- just even more downloads than that and you'll see some of that. As our partners have deployed those different assets. I'm communications training was something critical we're gonna need. A lot of different trusted messengers and in order their trusted- but in order for them to have an impact they need to be effective as well. And so to date we've- collaborated to put together for different. Communications trainings across the county where we've had a hundred and thirty two different organizations participate. Again this is done in coordination with our partners at the state. The county and the city as well. Is just an image of different community partners- building their capacity talking about there was a lot of conversation early on about message testing and what are we learning from focus groups. This is an image of all of that testing being put to use in our trusted messengers and working and preparing for how to not just talk to the community but to media. To make sure every opportunity we get we get the right message. I'm we shared with with the committee a quick snapshot M. report of the scale of resources that have been deployed so here in LA county as of last week. We've been able to provide grant funding for get out the count activities to a hundred organizations across the county totaling. Twelve point seven million dollars in investments- with a mix of both public dollars in private dollars this covers a range of tactics everything from door to door. To train the trainer to implementing more effective- digital media out reach an obviously as well- preparing for becoming a questionnaire assistance center and other ways to help and be part. Of the effort. I'm I won't go into these pieces but in the materials we provided and happy to answer questions about what communities have been covered what populations have been covered. I we've been able to document and share that in center pan to your earlier question about. Our region language there's what will be able to print and we're working all across the different partners. To do as much as we can but as far as organizations on the ground we recorded about thirty seven different languages covered through the various partner so far in the grant making and so that gives us extensively more reach. Out to what we're doing and we've provided for transparency purposes were all the organizations so far that have been funded so. Once again wanna thank you all at the state fair leadership the partnership with the state census office but more importantly our local leadership at the county and the and the cities that allowed us. To really build this M. partnership. Thank you mistress committal. Now the Long Beach forward Mr Suazo. It's going to take a moment to click through there you go all right a good morning good afternoon whatever time it is- legislatures spent this time there is never any never enough time in the census my name is James was on the associate director at Long Beach forward on the first off I have to say hi mom because she's watching the live stream right now so- I am excited to share a little bit about what Long Beach for it is working on as one of the regional coconveners with Ellie regional census table. And we can unless it was K. and so on a little bit about going off of what- the faint talked about in terms of our we were organizing in thinking about scale because when we think about the census and what it takes to get a complete count it's a question of scale right on so for us in our approach with LA county in on one of the largest and hardest account in the country we know we have a- large task. Ahead of us and our approach to that first I'm actually off all the nineteen with the LA regional census table which was- research we restructure the beginning of the year. To tell coconveners including Long Beach. Which are the events from project California hello boys became a beautiful. On the cell a collaborative Cynthia we'll talk a little bit about their work- Anil deli partners for health- to really organize and bring together community based organizations- to learn about the census help get prepared. And really it's a recognition that CBO's are trusted messengers within the community and to focus and prioritize. Our efforts on hard to count communities- our role is not only just to reach out to her to come communities but more importantly what often doesn't get looked up. Is to validate all of the messages that are already being put out there by different levels of government. By our local municipalities- and to ensure that that people understand- about the safety and security of the census. So one of the efforts that have come out of that collaboration and resource sharing. Has been the week count campaign which you've seen- that lesson just logo I introduce you now to the- I think cooler Long Beach version of the logo- I'm a little biased. And but just to give you an idea of what the scale looks like right when we're talking about a regional approach. We're also oh my gosh when. Okay we're also talking about a regional approach- in the sub regions right. Where we have organizations within Long Beach coming together and all of these different organizations- that you can see listed on. Working on various levels of census education and not reached hardy count entities. And what that actually look has looked like on. Has been different- as we've been go as been rolling out of. Coming month and I will say for us our team- back in our- in our community the census is already here right there's no it's coming it's already here for us. The what that's look. It's been connection and bringing organizations together. Has allowed us to do more relationship building not just within organizations. And within our ecosystem but also across sectors. So been able to leverage relationships with anchor institutions such as state Long Beach. Even working with the city as well- but also availability asset building and how we can- bring in community. To read account community actually off thank you. The that's something that we didn't one of our early meetings we had organizations come in whether they were large nonprofits or small grassroots neighborhood groups saying. Ever going to reach out to the senior population for gonna reach us the black population we need people from those communities to do that. And as you all probably know that requires a hefty amount of resources to really support and do that properly- and for us it's really about doing hitting. The ground running with direct out reach so whether that's a door knocking phone banking. And actually doing that to scale where we can prioritize areas such in Long Beach. Like a central west in north Long Beach where you have these concentrations. Of hard account communities and just the lastly underscore- but if I. N. mentioned. All of these efforts and everything that you see in these photos of folks coming together in doing this work. Is long term capacity building and I want to emphasize that. This investment in community based organizations to do this work is a long term investment and the health of the communities. Where so many other social programs and economic strategies that you all are looking at is directly impacted by this. So we're building a long term strategy to really engage people directly from the community. And at the same time engage people on the importance of the census. Thank you. Thank you Mr Swasawke. I thank you also for making sure that the streaming is most valuable so we know we have at least one viewer. We appreciate that mom for. Tuning in that'll help our metrics so. All right. Thank you. This Cortez. Greetings everybody- my name is Cindy and I'm very happy to be here to talk a little bit about the work the seller collaborative is doing in the southeast LA- to share a little bit about the collaborative we are network of nonprofit organizations gather to lead southeast Los Angeles county. Into era vitality by strengthening the seller communities. Building collective power. And encouraging regional systemic change. Now one of the first things I want to. Talk about. Is what did our twenty ten. Census response your profile look like. And this map- really highlights the fact that our region is considered very high are. Has a very high or high low response gore. And we also know that this indicators derived by the twelve variables that inform the hard to count index. So when we start talking about what is it going to take to actively reach. The nooks and crannies of the not only the different cities. But unincorporated areas or different spaces that are not necessarily easy to reach by virtue of our maybe street infrastructure system. We have learned that by being able start these conversations early on. Our region has a lot of unique stake holders. That are all committed for census engagement out reach but at various degrees. So looking up this mat we know I want to highlight limited English proficiency. Foreign born certified and being a renter or living in a multi family units address. Are going to be the big variables that are impacting the score. What we also know that because it's highly read. All of the twelve are very active in this region which- means we have to be very proactive and how we're gonna tackle this. To talk a little bit about our Ellie are C. T. space. We do convene a significant amount of nonprofit organizations C. Beals. In southeast LA. But because of the nature of our city boundaries the nature of where our non profits are located. And just because we're really trying to convince the region we also have the deferments apologies. Folks such as gait Kommersant or what these are different folks that joined the space to talk about their own sense of. Outreach activities in a into the work the C. B. older. Doing that include train the trainer models from but I training campaigns- youth ambassador work on mobile. Ask unit. So what we're what we're coming to this table and everybody gets the opportunity to report out in the regional discussion component. That means are also able to usher in a conversation on the gap analysis. So while we know what I may be doing for hard to count and my are restrictive and what geographic area I want to reach. When you're listening to this fire thirty to forty to fifty different voices we can still build a common understanding of what are the additional efforts or the partners we need to engage with. To make sure that as you move towards March we are not only well prepared with census knowledge but we're well informed on a regional strategy. So a lot of the work that we're doing is holding the space so that we understand the roles. Of not only the C. deals are meant to support partners. And different key players that I want to highlight to you. Which include- how do we continue to engage our non CEO community star grassroots organizations and volunteer groups. That are highly motivated because at the end of the day they do know that these- these funding resources impact their daily lives. But how do we get them the resources. In a timely manner and in a very accessible way. We also recognize that for the southeast region our faith based organizations are another additional trusted messenger. We know that our schools are trusted messenger so what does it mean to make sure that they are also in a timely manner. Having the conversations building that awareness to feel very comfortable when perhaps on delivering a sermon. Or whatever out reach strategy they elect into. The last piece- because of the coordinating component worth trying to figure out are we collaborate in a record eight are cross promoting. Understanding which later of pollution our blossoming in do. How do we as a collaborative hold that space. To connect people with the right agencies are the right place are they have a question. About cats were connected them with the city of a late work. Away or if their partner that's active in Long Beach making sure that they are connected with chains are partners in- San Fran Alex on and so. Forth that's a little bit about what I wanted to share with you all to. Thank you Cortez. I'm let's and the comments and questions with Senate pan. Thank you thank you so much your presentations on the work you're doing and I appreciate the fact that does recognize that the census at work. Really is going on right now right I mean we start counting in April but the- the US is saying the social norms and building those relationships that well Bob for us in case people you know others counter messages may happen later on and so forth. In and I appreciate that- that actually that this contest touched on this a. When we look at the census. You know. Everything's divide by geography with census tracks isn't it you know we- cities and counties the odd boundaries and so forth. But for some communities right I mean- the community isn't. A geographic what it's not the idiom maybe there's they may be in certain areas more than others but they're surrounds spread out and I. Without actually interest of the sets of data will help us understand that right so. The ability of GTP community right Tom. API committees are de maybe some places they concentrate but they're also spread out. So when we're trying to figure out how to message. Right in of so I actually heard this from somebody who said well. What was with the senses budget very geographic based right. And that that's not really working for my community because we're not all one's face were kind of scattered around so what are you doing to be sure as were touching communities and we are you know I mean census enumerators people point to geographies but- that were- crosscutting vertically for you know of smaller communities are two meters that are less visible- how but in terms of reaching out to people that isn't just geography based but- they'll they share a C. sure Sir. Culture or other L. characteristics are challenges in terms of you know fear of discrimination- they've C. thing. But they're more spread out. Can you maybe speak to that what kind of work that the hi how are you trying to bridge that. So I'll I'll briefly sharing try to. Take us back to one Klay side just for illustration to my comment I think that's that's a very critical point in and a lot of the convening has been geographic but when we talk about really penetrating community and doing work the first step was first even with geography usually folks want to have meetings in downtown. Where four thousand square mile county and not everybody identifies as Los Angeles and so the idea that James shared about regional lies in the efforts so that communities could gather more locally around the region they at least identify with was a way to get more local. I'm they're still be on that to your to your point which is which is spot on our other communities other identities that that clustering do if you look at some of our graph you see that up Holly county has the largest native American- population in the country but you wouldn't guess that because there's not a city that's majority native American. But yet we have court partners that we funded LGBTQ community so the funding spread out we convene a lot generally I think there are he Peter ship folks African American communities is not south LA it's up in antelope valley it's dispersed across into Pomona in other areas and so we have key organizations doing that work it's just not convene than a geography but- yes and part of our strategy as you see in the graph is making sure we cover that. The other thing I would add to that question. Is really important and I think when we dive into the complexity of how we're approaching. You know thinking about what is the what is the strategy look like on the geography Bates versus population base right. There it comes down to a matter of tactics to write when we think about our door knocking strategies in as work. On designing where are the areas were targeting in terms of certain neighborhoods that's great for specific card account areas and the reality at least for Long Beach. Is that you have very dense areas that are hard to reach where it's a multitude of different hard to come populations right so we're talking about engaging partners like the United can putting community interface commute organization. What we could have teams of canvassers who speak Spanish and come I. because we don't know what's gonna happen at the doors right. But on the other level there's also this- as a frame mentioned relying on organizations that can reach popular in based hard account communities right. To rely on kind of a network model where gauging organizations that. Bill Ted of deep. Membership and a base to really use that and encourage folks to reach out to the networks as well so. Part of that challenge of convene is trying to these two the space for the second time but- does that. This is the developing now to take into consideration. Ins. One thing I really appreciate appreciate about the framework of hard to count or geographic reach or tactic is out when were able to talk about what area we may be focusing in on the tape im reaching hard to count population Latino Spanish speaking but somebody else's reaching- the Hindu population they know that a seller region and we can cover the map an old Spanish will do a good go far but when it comes to like other language pockets they also are tapping into physically what our locations folks are coming together at so that you can do if- physical- visible touch point with them- another. Is that when they're moving through geography maybe the C. the banner or the C. I hear about a training happening it's how many times do we need to reinforce the message so that the goal is that they behave in a way that they fill out the form not only I know about this and but I'm not too sure if I'm gonna do it so we have to combine they have to C. consistently as it of the but they wake up to falling asleep when they're on social media opening up emails visually has to be a camp. I could be physically and argue- neighborhoods but also in the difference is they engage with are people talking about it so combining it is- our way of kind of understanding that we need to get this message out there at least. Ten fifteen twenty times before I guess gonna do it. Tell. Is known for competing at hard to count population were are on a G. two Q. presents meeting or if you're up agency that have multiple sites are all of your sites echoing the same thing the become something- understood by everybody with thank you so much and the those were trying figure out to that region appreciate that you recognize this issue- and then I know you're in the room when a person to the other question then I can pose a question again as a comment you know this by the time this before you really get in bill for the new year starts is. Sir thinking about I'm sure you've done this and you have a lot of different but- the end just think about. Are there gaps there because of that- so appreciate that. You would say something about that. Yeah I just I just want to add to I think that like one of the things that we've talked about that we really- release all. And the coconveners a we've admired about the approach that the California community foundation is taken. Is when we think traditionally and talking about. How we're engaging CBO's with to do census out reach we think of the organizations that how honestly a lot were listed in the steering committee right these. Large organizations that have capacity right and the skills to do this. One of the- because we understand the importance of what's at stake in the census count. There are regional approach and sub regional approach has allowed us to really engage. The small grassroots organizations that may not even have staff but they know people in the neighborhoods they can hold those block parties. We have around the fiestas coming up in December right we could actually engage people from the community. And engage in that type of strategy and allow- resources to share resources. To allow them to participate and get rid of some of those. Years so that's that's so important and I just want to split that up to emphasize. The you raised. I appreciate that is someone who I'd like to see if he teaches asset base me the valve and we talk about the power of association C. on the informal networks. And write it. Because they made many I'll have stepped. Informal right and so oftentimes they're not engage because they- had. Three other types of things but- we need for you how to reach out to them because they can. They can help out thank you. Thank you Senate pan Senate and house. Yes I think all my questions have been answered this is just more of a comment I'm really blessed to have both of these- incredible of people in my district in Senate district thirty three both Cynthia and James and F. I. N. thank you so much for work as well as doctor Wilma Franco I know she's here as well and- I just wanna say on behalf of our residents were really proud because we know that we have a lot of work to do- in the district that is going to be. One of the most affected so thank you all for your work very much. In the new wallpaper. Plenty of signs that you can. And I have signed for everyone so they're they're also. Yes also thank you all very much I know it's just Cannella another's have been working on this for a few years and trying to put together way in advance the sort of the structure of the organizing of organizers and organizations one thing and I plan to ask also on the state level that is visibly missing very much and he would be a shame to be left out. Is labor. Organized labor obviously has resources organize and I don't mean just like dollars the resources as far as an organization many organizations- they tend to have a high rate of activism they tend to have a high rate of- turnout with union members because they're engaged with an organization as you find with other the group so I'm curious to see at your level- the regional level- why that appears to be missing. It may not but it appears to be missing. So I appreciate that I think that. Definitely one thing that's been cut- communication has been there at a larger the alley census regional table does meet at a macro level so there's the regional meetings and a pipe into a larger median I know that they frequently- participate in that the what you're seeing on the region always really the community led part I think we could do more. I'm I think that- having leadership now at- complete count committee level- with SCA use presence there and in on mas apiece could really be helpful in that I'm I know that in our Leyva we had initial coordinating and- ordaining conversations with with the Allen county federation of labor who was very helpful they've been. Participants throughout I think it's not reflected here in terms of who's been funded or not and who are the- leads convening but I think at this very stage to center pants point about who's missing. As we really hear the starting gun go off it'll be key. I will say both- the county and the city through the complete count- local complete count have also been engaging in making sure to communicate with labor as well. But I think there's- one more integration level needed to drop down and I'm I'm glad that you raise that. Brought that up. I just add because there's they're in. Anyway I just I just hope with de LA federation that they're formally broadband- so many different unions so many different geographical area so much of the geographical area. And I think if we don't do it early it's a really really missed- very big missed opportunity. And I will share that I'm they I have shared weather at the tables are as we've met with them- that they were working on plans and we're doing that but I think now's the time to now bring them all together. Mr squeal it is there a simple way of describing. How all of the efforts are being coordinated- I know you that was a big part of the presentation I so you give a body your sole goal. This so many efforts there's the city's there's the counties there's a school districts there's community based groups there's always organized by one alliance and there's the state effort. Is there a simple way of describing this or is it just is so much out there that we ought to be glad there's different groups yes it's the state gives us the money not to Skinner. I'm it I've I it it is and one is you do see a lot of different tables but what has been clearly defined among all of us in the partners. Are very early on was what will the county in the city's focus on and we see and participate and support that. What will- the steering committee- with the support of C. C. F. focus on which was on the ground the CBO's we will we will see that so the county the city's went out there actively. Trying to grant or fund philanthropy said the ACBL structures what the what the state put in place we will then pull all our money so that we're not having organizations right seven different proposals whether our own. Way of talking about the census and so. The simple way is we all identified the lanes needed and everybody trusted each other to run those lanes and today as you see the different presentations. We kind of each are talking about our lanes but we all communicate and coordinate. It looks. Eight I'm- it does though however look messy. And so. But it's working because everybody has their lanes and we're doing. Thank you senator also seven number Berman. Quick question for a friend you mentioned that that LA- has had a lot of state support also a lot of philanthropic support in is in a pretty good place- right now- at this stage of the game are there things that. This region can share with other regions of the state that maybe don't have the resources the for the private sector resources- and maybe didn't get us started as earlier as you all have is there any sort of mechanism for sharing kind of best practices with some of the other regions of the state I know that you've got to focus on on. The artist account county but- yeah what any any efforts are appreciated by some others that are maybe a little further behind. Absolutely so first off say I think we have had the states that Bob and philanthropy step up as well but I will be honest that a hundred organizations- is a lot but it's also not did what what we have funded so far in the twelve million is a little bit less than half of what different organizations stepped up to offer but I think we're in a good place and then we were in any other time to meet this challenge. To your question about sharing best practices one is every asset that we we're developing is open and shareable with folks- the state has been working on sharing and communicating some of what we're doing but were also now- working with them and thinking about how do we do that more formally maybe right before- we pass the starting line- but yes any asset that's being developed we're- ready and- eager to say. You know this website that we created for C. B. O.'s all that content can be. Strip use an and a white labeled perfect. Vision I think on that note to I just want to add to that when we think about. For us to think about like LA county as a whole right again the question of scale. It's been a really great I like I often refer to it as like a an interesting social experiment like from that kind of level to think about. Us as organizations is coconveners because the landscape in Long Beach is similar yet different than Stella and it's very different from antelope valley right and- so many other valleys I live in Long Beach I don't go to the other ballots but- are. Able our ability to come together and share how we're organizing approaching the region's has informed so many other strategies of how we're being more cohesive as a region Allen. And I think there's been no other opportunities where each of us have been asked in and are willing to share with other folks across the state in terms of how we're approaching and- trying to understand what this reasonable containing looks like but also. What are what are these Beth strategies. For a reason sharing and collaborating bring photo the other two. And one thing I would add is I beat by virtue of the senses we've I've been able to expand our network. So now becomes okay no- based off of the list provided by C. C. F. you're- being funded to do this work I want to meet you. What is your work look like what is your general day to day look like. And that allows us to buttock our capacity to be connected. So being able to build those relationships and not only share our understanding and strategies with the senses. Allows us to think differently about coronation critical ask each other. What band with the you have aren't what resources can you offer what made you not be able to do but how do you want to be engaged so it's- opening up those dialogue that are critical and to move closer. Towards April. Thank you. All right thank you soon member vermin. Couple questions let me direct my question to you Mister Sebadoh and the other two of you can chime in when you think he's wrong. So Bob. That's gonna be often so it in. In in Orange County terrible ventures it actually they engage in their own. Activity to raise additional psalms are are you any of you engage in that activity. No not from filled philanthropic sources yeah cat California community foundation as a committee foundation we we're Los Angeles county focus so we I. play space. In the past and historically we have been a resource and a partner to Orange County community foundation sore level of engagement has been through any communication and coordination with them as sort no I mean are you seeking sources from for example foundations. Themselves to augment your efforts. We did and we received I'm little bit over I think we got up to seventeen point four million- so about ten million. Or twelve million in philanthropic resources okay city the end is that part of your mission to reach out. What we said we set a goal early on working with the stern command and our partners of what would be what we need are the real need was identified at forty million we said. Let's start at twenty and so twenty has been our goal and that's what we've been gates the state on the city of al a the county and then philanthropy that stepped up with additional dollars. Let me ask you Jim who's your boss mistress Camilla. With my boss yes. The community of Los Angeles but is there any one individual you view is your boss. The report any one individual until now Hernandez the president of our California coming from all right Sir source of. It was my boss yes. My boss is Christine Pettitte- executive director all right scores as. Orally doctor Wilma Franco and the communities we serve. Okay I'm in in do you report to- California of the complete count committee your complete count California. We report- and collaborate directly with the state census complete count office I'm and that's who we work with directly on a day to day and report on our contract activity and what we're doing on the ground with the resources okay and then same question I asked the previous panel in terms of metrics one do you have performance measures. And to if you just give an example of one of your performance measures- sometimes referred to as metrics. Yes we will have a range of metrics in different areas so and I'll be on a our partner at the county shared a little bit about the media Metrix so those are M. we sure communicated in and shared a number of those with the state there are all give you an example- one M. one metric for us was. Funding at least one hundred organizations to do get out the count efforts and so we've reached that now begins the work with US C. of- establishing metrics around how many people were contacted through these various activities many facilities. Were serving ask questioners and centers on a media side how much digital- reach that we have and if we have media partners out what what was the measurable the fact that I'm and so we're working to establish those because we have the metrics what we're working with the state on and have had a lot of great support from the sort D. this how we collect. Those metrics. What is this so. Form is bitter our performance measures we want to fund a hundred different. Entities right in then. The metric would be how are you doing in terms of fun so you've you've met that but how are you doing in so in other places do you have and I'm gonna ask each of you and an example of a performance measure- and how you're- assessing whether you're meeting that performance measure. So I would say a bomb. Yes and to keep but the example of the hundred organizations- up on the screen you see. We have performance measures working with the our community partners we sat what are the important- tactics on get up the count. That we need to move our heart to count communities and we have been measuring ourselves by how well have we done. In supporting each of the key tactics so up on the screen you see these little icon infographics. Back that gives you broken down. For the organizations we funded how many covered the top eight tactics that have been identified as effective for her to count so that's I think a concrete example. Of how we're measuring our progress so far and right now it's been on getting resources out and making sure it's to the right things and in the right places. Long Beach forward. Terms of performance measures first some of our performance met- a lot of it met- sits on direct outreach efforts and measuring the strength of our collaboration so for instance. On the direct out reach peace- part of our role as language Ford in each of our different organizations that have gotten grants from- CCF which is the combination of funds. There are things like fifty thousand hours of direct outreach whether that's phone banking whether that's a door knocking to different hard to count communities that are identified gaps. Based off was being funded- who's doing what so not only is it looking at the people who are already at the table but what are the gaps that are identified. And other other organizations that are trust the messenger G. performance measures fifty thousand. Hours in and how are you doing on that. Are we haven't started that we're in the process of hiring people so that way Connie January we can start talking- so the other other isn't examples would be. A number of community events so instead our organizations that use all logos for earlier we have a metric- bill mean. January and July meeting. On a monthly basis that's right. Fact in a is. Because people want to meet more often than just once a month to. Get a handle on all the coordination and even things like of the community events not just direct out reach in the community like a fiesta or gathering. But also for stakeholders one of our metrics was organizing a- stakeholder meeting for decision makers that long which forwarded. Two months ago and we brought together representatives from your respective offices from the city from education to talk about what organizations are doing C. this group does. So one of the ways we're looking at data situating it back on the twenty ten Allora scores were one of them is- engage fifty nonprofit organizations in census our reach that allows us to look at submatrix we're looking at well to what extent are folks using our senses event calendar put on by the seller collaborative we can look at the back and metrics on how many people are using the website do they sell for port value added are they able to coordinate with different- did you set a- goal for how many people are looking at the website. Not a goal with that because it's such a it's in its pilot phase you want to get at least two three months of data and to set that baseline and then start to analyze what would be a reasonable goal and mobilize towards it so some of the things are newer but for us we felt that the fifty C. Beals is reasonable our network provides twelve already and M. moving through the Ellie are C. T. convening than just seen at the different fine and she's an who's represented a who's not there we believe that fifty is gonna allow was the range we need- across the three categories of out reach. And parts come population geographic so that not gold has allowed us to have conversations to develop some goals like all the ten cities and to incorporate areas actually being reached so it's a good anchor for us but we're also committed to learning feedback loop process to in this complete cal California or they enquiring as to your metrics your performance measures and whether you're meeting them or not. Sorry KP so complete cal California that's the over arching organization as I understand it or are they enquiring as to whether you're setting performance measures whether you're you know setting of you're creating metrics that kind of thing yes we've worked collaboratively with them as we've developed our implementation plan and I've submitted our reports on the progress of that we've also had meetings with the sword team- to start thinking about how will you be collecting those metrics what support do you need from the state- without so we have been to some. Thank I think that- part of what our conversations are as far as- how many people do you think. That you can reach were at a stage where. We don't want to limit ourselves and say we should Pat ourselves on the back of we reach a million people because- the charge given to us by you all and the state was. Get everyone counted and so- as far as metrics though the state has been very supportive and we've been reporting. On going and they give us feedback and share their expectations with and I realize it's hard you know so for exams some things are are quantifiable number of a numerators that you've hired number of click whatever it may be. It's much more challenging in this operation one because the time spent but also because of the more amorphous nature. Business you say they are revenue goal is you know a hundred dollars and we're at ninety so. We need to earn another ten dollars much easier- okay biggest challenges is. Briefly other than money what's your biggest challenges. Each of you. Biggest single challenge. Other than the size of the county in the two thousand right hard to counts tracks I'm I think I'm gonna mention this it's really time and it's not this is not some amorphous challenge it's real it's taking every day I would have to say that the biggest challenge for us right now is organization to starting to deploy their folks is just the continuous guidelines that the census puts out we're beginning to feel like I'm it's really discouraging to wanting to talk to someone about the senses of the federal or the federal census has put out several guidelines that. Use words like it's federally prohibited to contact someone or talk to them about certain things you can't make phone calls to people I'm we continue to use our own discretion on that but I think the biggest challenges just kind of the bureau start a focus on regulating how communities can talk to each other about the senses- that were concerned would be- a challenge moving forward and I think the other one which the state- legislature and governor are going to have been so right in doing this was the passage of a B. fifteen sixty three. By assembly member Miguel Santana go and- Gonzalez around creating a census bill of rights in California to make sure. That some. Power for into T. like our state government is insuring are Californians that they do have rights and who can and can't participate I think. On that will be very helpful to meet those challenges well most that's most useful if you can. Provide us the specific challenges that are being posed by the federal government that will help us because Anderson pan will get resolved so right. Yes and he will it. Right in terms of singular challenge I think going back to this idea of scale but also what senator that also brought up around how do we need lead talk about what's going on. We just can't and I think what what has happened- because of the efforts of C. C. F. and all of our convening organizations with the we count campaign. Is that the CBO- effort to reach hard account communities is very well organized. But and I can't say that for all of the other sectors where they have that hasn't been years of this kind of planning. And what we struggle with is trying to in good faith think about how do we collaborate and connect with other local levels of government anchor institutions are education healthcare labor right all of these other. Sectors that just aren't in the same place where we are at and our terms of our efforts in outreach and recognizing that partnership moves at the speed of trust. And for some of these institutions and its particular with our organizations that just isn't there and unfortunately we don't have time to build that trust so it's really relying on- people within different institutions. To put a lot of trust up front and I'm thankful for individuals like Julian so new that Kevin Jackson here in the city of Long Beach of understood that. To really think about how do we start breaking down these barriers thanks. This contest. I think it's been able to expand a who are partners are. One example in cell is going to be our parent volunteer groups. So while we know that the different institutions like L. USY are preparing to support those parents. When we talk to them on the ground the C. we really want to have coffee and census talks conscience senses has been one of the things they brought to the table. But we know that also takes some resources that maybe take some trainings for them. So as we think about- what are the best ways to engage particularly those parents groups. On one of the things that we were really excited about and I'm going to follow up with our full. Our friends at the city and the county. Ellie city in the goodwill ambassador program not only was able to provide a volunteer Steven for folks getting trained. But is also offering a mini grant to hold an event in your community. So when we hear about things like that in the southeast we want to be able to- learn how to replicate that because that's what we're hearing. From our parents from our cousins from our youth. I think all we want to get active to but what is the right. For stern to support that design. Thirty thank you less because it's your mother watching. The but if she has hi mommy yeah okay thank you all right thank you very much we appreciate your input. Thank you. The next panel- reading writing counting utilizing schools to increase participation of Los Angeles county office of education- ms of Jana and brought a. Also a Los Angeles unified school district- devore a no Lara read chief education and litigation counsel. And then- Long Beach unified school district Quinn brown program administration. In once again I'm still confident we can all read so if there's anything you'd want to supplement we're happy to receive it so let me begin with- Los Angeles county of education Mrs with Jana. I'm driving. Good afternoon. Honorable chairs and members of the committee my name is Viviane Andrade on the general counsel for the Los Angeles county office of education which is of course the largest county office in the state I would like to acknowledge and thank the governor's office the Senate and assembly leadership for making local educational agency census out reach a budget priority the trust that you placed in us and the investment that you have made is really critical to a positive outcome on the census. After all all of the research unequivocally shows that schools and teachers are the trusted messengers we all come from cultures where the words of love my yes throughout or in my S. throw are held in high esteem the money that's been allocated to what now amounts to nine hundred and sixty three schools we will be put to great use by the forty three find it hard to count school districts. So I'd like to speak to you about the efforts we've we have under way but let me start first by addressing the curriculum I it in the census curriculum census twenty twenty count me in it's been an in process over the past several years the purpose is to educate students and teachers the historical importance of the sexes its function the use of data the importance of the complete count. And advocacy products of projects and I. one under find out because the project because I think that's really really important. Up the. The our killer was specifically designed it was created by teachers it was tested. To online to California history social science standards it's short it's concise it's easily implemented. And it includes a taking action type approach to energize and to equip students to organize campaigns to also assist in getting out a complete count. And examples include student develop posters PSAs brochures assemblies presentations to parents. Add to their community groups. I see that those that those projects are really important because- what's become really clear to us. Is that as we rolled out the census curriculum we married it with with legos outreach efforts. And in the past couple of months we convened a hundred sixteen. Our educators in LA county. Twenty two came from the out reach funded districts. And we had some teachers actually bring students to are convening. And it was amazing when you saw the students and their interest and they're of. Absolute interest because they get it and we know that kids. A large part some of our students are going to play a very very important part. In this in the census in working with their families because after all when we look. At the role that students play historically sometimes they've been translators and interpreters for our community this time out what's really fascinating is that those kids are tech savvy they know how to do it. And as long as they have access to the internet and they have access to the resources they're gonna lead and help lead their parents. In making sure that the census is completed. So I'm as part of the curriculum that that we have it's really focused and we're hoping that there will be school districts and some of the schools that will focus on. Our. Having students play and continue to play that that role in part by. Part by perhaps of sponsoring online video competitions or other creative type efforts aimed at students because we understand they're the ones that are going to benefit ultimately of from the census outreach so let me talk a little bit about the outrage that we have under way on December third earlier this month we convened representatives. From the forty three school districts virtually all of them were present and those that were not present were present virtually of we anticipated the importance of having nonprofit partners present so some of the people that came and spoke to you earlier today we're at our convening- and it was a fabulous. A fabulous fabulous convening all we had nonprofits such as not Leyva we have non profits such as- the advancement project the other thing we did which was absolutely critical is that we used the resources from the California community foundation and we provided a communications type training for the school districts that were there. Our thanks to the of the work of fountain which I have to tell you was absolutely fabulous it's online it's a open sourced and it and it really allows school districts do the things that they need to do which is to have ready resources in hand ready to ride because really the I. which piece of this. Is gonna come face to face person to person and allowing teachers and allowing educators to do that work in the time to do that work is really critical and not have it bad I- doing things like having to create a separate documents but to be able to share all the resources so that was certainly the work that we were doing a we're continuing to do that. We look forward to- take to continue to partner with all of the school district. Thank you ms and rather. Our next Los Angeles unified school district misread. Thank you so much committee members it's an honor to be part of this panel. On behalf of Elian the fight school district. For LA unified and many school districts in the state so much is at stake. When it comes to serving our highest needs population. LA unified is the largest school district and state as you met me very well no. And we are work very well positioned to reach a wide range of hard to count populations and leveraging the services and resources. Over thirteen hundred and twenty two schools and centres. Into activating them into census- action kiosks and other- and other. Activities and targeted areas were hardest account communities. The district has already incorporated a lot of the information for census and to our we are one LA unified campaign- much of our efforts this year and into next year we are leveraging the we are one LA unified campaign and to making it. We are one LA unified make LA unified count. The district has. Over sixty thousand employees which we hope we will leverage as our senses messengers we have embedded partners not only- internally with our labor partners and associations. We have started engaging with our labor partner such as you tell a M. as C. I. you- in immigration efforts and we will continue to do so for census efforts. The district has a lot of organizations within it and we will leverage those as well we have the division of adult and career education. Which serves over seventy thousand students annually in its programs they have about eleven- mean adult education centers in over a hundred for the satellite locations which we will use for census action chaos as well. We have the beyond the bell program which provides before and after school programming they are currently at the height six hundred and thirty five school sites and they have about fifty four hundred part time team members who have direct supports who offer direct supports daily. To parents and to students. Since the zero to five age group is the most undercounted age group in the nation LA unified has a unique opportunity to reach those parents in our multiple early education programs. With over thirteen thousand children currently enrolled in our educational center programs we will leverage our teachers and our early ad centers in two senses active- section action kiosks so while. We also have a parent community service this branch which focuses on family engagement and we have about five hundred family centers throughout the school district which will be used for census information centers. And lastly we have our students. And our students I've used I've heard they use the word used- numerous times during this- committee hearing as ambassadors and our students are going to be our greatest ambassadors I echo what miss Andrade said. That students are going to be the conduit to our families. And to their extended families and communities so we plan on engaging our students and having student led efforts into the census. I just wanted to again thank this committee and also the legislature for recognizing that schools are the nucleus of a community and we are the trusted partners in the community in an for using the resources into the schools thank you very much. Thank you mystery a Mister brown. Good afternoon. Excuse me US senator Umberg- senator pan and assembly member- Bergman and other distinguished committee members- my name is Clinton brown and I work on other deputies superintendent's office and I'm glad to be here to represent the Long Beach unified school district. Efforts to this point and- I won't reiterate a lot of the things that I just heard I'll just talk to you about just some of the activities that we've done we are very proud to be co chairs- with the city of Long Beach you heard from Mister Jackson earlier. The first effort we've we did- about a month ago is our superintendent put out a memo to all of our Long Beach unified school district stakeholders- that touches over two hundred thousand people. Are just talking about the senses the importance and- if we don't count all the people in our particular city. Then there will be certain cut so we were very transparent in the importance of that. We to a plan to utilize our family resource centers to house some of the- census- chaos is- and we are targeting those hard to count communities- in the city of Long Beach. We serve over seventy seventy two thousand students in the district and over eighty thousand employees so we feel that we can touch the entire. Spectrum of the city of Long Beach. We have also started through our public information a department we started a social media blast- informing people about the senses were the kiosks will be located- also we will have. At every school site will will we will have a place for parents and guardians of community members to actually come and do the questionnaires take the senses we just have a place where they could get more information about the senses. And just have that. As my colleague said a trusted partner in this effort. We also have. We met with us a representative from the US census bureau in regards to the- count me in curriculum so we have started working with our district curriculum leaders to develop additional lesson plans that we're going to kick off in the month of January that will touch all of our students K. through twelve- in a social sciences were good also wrote about an arm in our math classes. Are science classes and also our English classes as well. And let's see here. Of course we're going to utilize a some of the information at our PTA meetings are paired forums- we touch a lot of people through head start we're going to do some work with. Informing our parents through our education celebrations that we have throughout the district. And again- we're gonna really utilize our students because again they are the. You know the we feel like they're on they there at the grassroots they're going to go home and talk with their parents and tell them about the importance of the senses so we have- started training all of our associated student bodies across the district and having them work- in our particular schools and classrooms to also get the word out to parents. And we were part of the- legal senses twenty twenty convening a last week which I feel was very powerful and very- informative and so we were able to take some of that information back so we feel like we're ready to go. And we have done some great work with Kevin and Julia Senate off I've heard his name a couple times he's he's excellent and- we look forward to continue with the work. So that we can. Count every person in the city of Long Beach thank you- thank you Mister brown I'm gonna turn the gavel over to. My co chair senator pan for just a few moments. Well thank you so very much for your presentations- chairman Anderson you had a one lead off first. Yeah I'll be great- and thank you so much for all the work that you're doing in the schools I totally agree that our students are- the maybe undervalued- it resource and trust the messenger for their families- and so. And M. day as somebody else earlier mentioned a captive audience- at least for the ones that show up- and so you know real opportunity to educate them about the importance and have them. Spread that message. I don't know to if you were here for the first panel we talked a little bit about- how were falling short in terms of our new were a numerator recruitment- and hiring and when. I think it was mis read was talking about adult ADD- yeah- that made me realize that that could be a great- potential resource for enumerators- and then so. Would encourage you to let them know about the opportunities- I did confirm with my staff that. You know enumerators do not have to be full time- they can working nights and weekends. So another. Resource could be- substitute teachers- and folks who were just looking to make you know some some extra money- because were were falling short need to get as creative as possible and in. Reaching our numerator recruitment. A goal so thought. Those can be to be that potential pools of applicants. Thanks. Okay other questions no all right of all I just first of all I just want to thank you so much for your work I and- really the role and I know that senator AHS been the- big champion in the capital for- for involving schools with the census and make sure that you have the resources to. Make that happen. Is the one question I would have for you. Is that you know. Night editor for example Long Beach it's actually that they could committee's co chaired by both those mentioned by the LA you a step the- school district sorry Isaiah. Long Beach school district yeah and also the C. so it's a great example of collaboration. In terms of- I he just touch maybe about how your so you're what you're teaching the curriculum I know that's something that you know we've fashion states of Roth. Terms how the school district is interfacing with. Let's say some of the CBO stuff about language access and other types of things so. And it's great you were trying to come up people lots of different- actions right you know the kids going to come home and tell them about it right to go see something out there hopefully you hear read something about it. So just in terms of you know obviously schools as centers of our communities they you interface a lot we have parent teacher organizations the idea of community organizations all around the school. How how's your C. high school districts- tapping into serve your networks of relationships that you have with- the surrounding communities around your school. And then- how that interfaces with- the sort of the various committees that- we've- heard from here today can you just. Talk about that and how to use it of course is that and how the students. Are you work with that perhaps the plugin students who might be interested. The one of the one of the first things we did when we did our convening was to invite the nonprofit partners. I have to say I think sometimes it's a real challenge. Of not because the non profits are not willing because they're they're they're ready they're- giving. Out sometimes it's really the education. Community that needs to figure out how how best to use it they may not have- a YA and infrastructure that's just not ready to pull them in. So that for us I think is one of the challenges. I and it is a it is certainly a challenging one that that we're continuing to work on. And to and to try to bring as many partners as we can add. To the schools. Are so that they so they can so that they can link I think we all recognize the importance. Of building communities and needing this in in the way that we can so that there's no- so that there's no repetition. Unnecessary repetition that we're not inventing reinventing the wheel every every which way but- but for us I think that use. That use a challenge and I think earlier we heard the Long Beach forces say the same thing it's sort of. Trying to figure out how best to break in and to and to become partners- so for so for us we certainly see that. Their appreciate your acknowledging also that. Forming partnerships and three of the infrastructure is not something just happens magically it takes time and effort and resources it's not something that you know oftentimes people talk like me Bates organizations like- you do this work can you. You know jun join our group. And they're like okay my calendars full of like I gotta get this group and I gotta do my real work right on the edge even get paid for baby I get paid for sometimes not. So appreciate recognizing that. We are actually very fortunate at LA unified school district to have very engaging robust partnerships with a lot of our community based organizations. It really began- couple years ago when we formed our we are one LA unified campaign standing with immigrant families. And through that campaign we have- interface would many immigrant- organizations chair lack of this and- and- the California community foundation has been a great supporter of our we are one LA unified campaign. So it feels like as we enter into our census work and we're transitioning into their are we are one make LA unified. Count campaign it seems almost like a seamless transition we are engaging with most of the same organizations. In our senses- much of our partners who were from the previous panels we've had meanings and part of that as long. As well as our partnership with late goal- and L. unified we are- as part of the legal office looking into M. O. use would CBO's. And having them assist in our senses outreach efforts as well. And that is one of one of the points that we will be. Of leveraging continue to leverage. And I want to echo that as well- when I first attended the meeting several months ago and saw the partners that were in there from the CBO's. Those particular organizations are already in our school system so we are. Already in alignment with him and- issues again it's seamless so we are on board and- they attend some of our events and vice versa so we're working collaboratively with an- intestine. Okay well I think the question no. Once that so all right well thank you so very much for your presentations and you're very important work on census thank you. And thank you pass a back to some Robert. All right next panel. State and federal updates bowstring local efforts in meeting requirement excuse me recruitment needs- mysterious Carnegie and Yolanda. Of those Connell Carnegie. Okay so my performance measure for this whole exercise is getting pronunciations correct so right right right. But we- are what we go ahead and if- if misa as Connell is here's miss look the Scott here. She is here okay all right. Anthony great we'll get afternoon honorable chairs and members thank you for the invitation to speak today my name is D. this Kentucky and I'm the director of the California complete count since twenty twenty office we appreciate the ongoing collaboration and support of the legislature to ensure that California is ready to achieve our fair share of resources and representation. In the decennial census first of all I wanted to say how proud and amazed at the work of our partners- that you've just all heard about- the integration of counties and cities sectors schools community foundations of that or weaving together. To create this outrage coverage is what we need I came back in twenty seventeen hoping that we can harness the energy creativity and commitment of these partners across sectors and I'm so relieved that these committed partners have come together to get it done. I do want to give a little shout out for some early thought leaders Dorothea park retired from LA county and doctor John the bard of the California dancer project you guys have seen in the past- presentations talking about this LA regional table you know he and I started conversations back in twenty seventeen of January when like nobody was even talking about census and so he's kind of one of those quiet leaders that really kind of thought about how does this all work how do we make. The sort of complex thing going on he also have leadership within C. pan the census policy advocacy network who was instrumental in working with all of you on our funding. So I just want to see that these early folks planted seeds that have grown into a tremendous powerful movement so whether you started working on census in twenty seventeen or if you're just coming to the table today by watching or participating in this hearing. Please know that it it won't just take one village it's going to take all the ledges to get this done and again all efforts are welcome and all efforts are needed. The partner's we've heard from today demonstrate why we're investing so heavily in our local ground game. Because they know. Exactly where to invest and or in order to educate and motivate the hardest to count Californians. As twenty nineteen comes to end. Or as we start our fourth quarter full court full court press. We're hearing up for January twenty twenty our office and are contracted partners are getting ready to make a shift of our outreach focus. From the motivate pays to the activities and we're gonna strategically move target audience toward the action of actually completing. The questionnaire. However as I look at the weeks to come and comparator efforts in two thousand and two thousand ten. It is clear that we're facing barriers on two fronts and that's how I classify them. The berries are motivational. And their structural. When we overcome the motivational barriers it means that people will want to fill out the questionnaire to help their families their neighbors their community. The little trust that their information is confidential. And the state's invested millions in overcoming these motivational bears. The structural barriers however. Are obstacles for how a person can participate in the sense that some summer panels touched on a little bit about that. These are operations and processes that are embedded in the federal government's administration of the census. The structural barriers Lee solely in the hands of the US census bureau. However California is a state as legislators as policy as partners. We need to be innovative and help mitigate the impact of the structural barriers. As the census our office role is to provide a bridge between the census bureau and our local partners on the ground. To facilitate communication information sharing and provide support and advocate for solutions that are innovative and meet the needs of our local jurisdictions. There are a number of structural barriers that our local partners have been identifying a bring forth to the state and asking for assistance. But I'm just going to touch on one we touch on others later in the queue in a- a structure where that if we don't help mitigate we put our count at risk. And that you guys have started talk about. The most immediate is recruitment of enumerators Harding university is and your laudable speak about those very real numbers that each and every. One of our jurisdictions needs with our unemployment rate being so low. The federal hiring process being so slow. And the lack of flexibility. And creativity about how we meet those hiring goals we are at a critical crossroads. Again we want to motivate those to be counted but if they're not a Newman- enough Newman is to knock on doors people don't self respond. After made may first hits then we risk all of those being missed. We are committed at the state- to partner with the census bureau a couple things that we've been doing to help drive recruitment we're doing job related posts on our social media- tool kits. Our high letting them in our partner newsletters our senses dot CA dot gov website includes information under new jobs resources all our social media channels are are pushing out the message we're finding ways to integrate with other out reach works for key audiences to seniors were doing work with seniors. College students were working with all our higher ed folks and other groups are well positioned for census bureau employment positions. This also includes employed messaging with labor agency employment development department and other labor focus stages agencies and departments. For those reaching a possible play polite cal vet and apartments retirees and other adults. Also regardless if our partners are getting funding. To help with recruitment I am hopeful that they'll realize the urgent need to help. With this recruitment regardless of their getting funding. In closing whether the structural barrier. Or motivational barrier no one single group or organization can achieve a complete count on their own. Coordinated collaborative efforts will be critical to success. And we look forward to continuing down this path into our fourth quarter. To mix metaphors taken across the goal line. That with our partners philanthropy legislature the census bureau and our other stakeholders to find solutions. Thank you for this time in I'm a bill to the to answer additional cost. Thank you miss Carnegie our next miss those Connell. Thank you for the opportunity I wanted to thank everyone I'm sitting here today I just saw all of the efforts that are made for the recruitment again from the state level from the county level from this city level and all the committee based organizations we really cannot do this without you- as D. does said- we do need it does take everyone to get a complete count so. I did kind of have a power point just candidates speak on a little bit of progress of the census bureau what we're doing. Richard all. Okay. So. Okay I. if they don't break there will okay so it's just an update- as far as recruiting update offered today. I just wanted to start off with California. So the California numbers if you can see from the slide. We have over. Leave it's. All recording goal for the state of California offer California we're at forty two days this was the number as- Monday but as of today were at forty four point 5% of our recruiting goal. Are the goal for. Our California offices on the next slide always show you just what we're doing we do have thirty offices that are located strategically in California and that's to support all of our numerators all of our field work. Again we have three offices in central California. We got ten in northern California and we have about seventeen offices offices specifically in the southern California area. Because this meeting focused on Los Angeles county and Orange County just wanted to bring up some of the numbers for Los Angeles county about a- but more over a week ago we were at 38% so as of today and this is the updated number for today's forty one percent. This we put it together yesterday so as you can see. It is slowly moving upward where we need to be- the other things for Orange County it's over seventeen thousand a new. Recruits for that area right forty six point eight percent. So we're slowly moving up and again this flight was as yesterday at the numbers that I just spoke right now our what we're doing actually today. So we did look those up on. Where are progresses and we're removing. On the other. Slide that we're talking about is most people that's what's our language goal. And if using some of the committee based organizations a lot of them on the census bureau website. They use the- planning database. So again with the geography as we spoke about- each track with at least 5% of the population primaries begin on English language. And again that's according to the planning database they created a language recruiting goal for- the census bureau's non response follow up operation. So the language recruiting on these tracks is equal to the percentage of population speaking that language it multiplied by the non response follow up recruiting goal or one or whichever is greater. And overall we have goals for thirty eight different languages and we have over a hundred and ten thousand nine hundred thirty. Total applicants with a language skill. Next labor gonna talk about is our recruiting strategies and again. You are part of Dodd integral- recruiting strategy and that's- reaching out to again. As everybody mentions is a higher education- we've targeted. Private companies companies we use worn less when companies are going out to offer census bureau jobs- we work with a lot of job local job centers with good will we are coordinating with companies and others to hire holiday season workers. So just as their jobs and then our jobs will begin- were engaged again partners- to assist with the recorded message and you are our partners and we are counting on you to get the word out about census jobs. We didn't put on your social media- but we need those trusted voices so that people could resonate with them respond are the other thing we wanted to talk about additional strategies is we do have recruiting assistance those are boots on the ground. All all most of our recruiting assistance begin other language our partnership team our partnership team is really an integral part in recruiting as well we work hand in hand that reach out to the- to our all of the community based organizations in the complete count committees and they're very well versed in. Just languages as well we've got we've increased and exhilarated our paid advertisement and nationally they're going M. started recruiting complex number six million dollars to get the word out about census jobs and distances were met. Where is very and a postcard Ben are directly to each household in some counties that we were under the goal than them each in the household. Again this is kind of a California map on where our app. Did you Ben. The light color is three yeah which is the lowest count running in a county and the dark. His color is about ten plus ads running in one place and again does include radio social media. Digital newspaper ads mall billboards in movie theaters. And we want to encourage everyone to apply we can do a lot of work duties advertisement but if there's not a voice with that- trusted person. Can encourage people to apply for the census jobs. We need to kind of get that message across our hiring timeline. This information is available on our website they did a very good job on putting all of the information on art twenty twenty census jobs website. As far as hiring. Timelines and again. Last but not least how you can help. Again we're encouraging you to get the word out- right now it's not it's at the back burner of everyone's mind we have thirteen recruiting weeks left after this week so right now it's- we have to instill a sense of urgency this is coming and this is coming very quickly and it's great that we have all in tears but we also want those volunteers at the numerators anyone that has a full time job can do this part time. It's a new census this time around going to have an iPhone because they can do the work it's a lot easier and again I will have my business card we have some handouts- we got some information everything is digital a lot of partner researches on our website- anything you can do to get the word out I am available for questions. Again my name's along blizzcon I put the contact information should you have any questions and again thank you for the opportunity. So thank you very much our senator Russell. Yes. Thank you both very very much. Since you are provided miss less Connell- the percentage of or the total goal for a numerous that you want a higher per per county. It seems and maybe you can go back to where we're at currently. It seems were really. This is really at a time period that's very tight soul. What are your thoughts about how to. Increase the number in such a short time period is- if you could go back to that- that's one question and then for both of you is. How would you gauge. A more successful campaign to do the census all we know were hard to count and in our part of in California overall but especially in this area- how would you gauge that we did better we did where we should I know were. You know looking for a 100% but- how would you how would you gauge it is they're- taking twenty ten and adding a certain percentage or- what we shooting for here. So as far as numbers- again they take in consideration of the workload to the goals are established are based on the work load based on if the county has the area census office located or not- and also offer refusal rates that we've experienced and does offer refusal rates are very between counties in offices and that's kind of one of our- biggest challenges right now because of the unemployment rate. And then also kind of. It's a different. Different environments some some of the other people are not interested in- at that point that's where we need a selling point it's going to work a lot better one on one speaking to people or having the trusted voices. Share those messages because if not the kind of just gonna scroll to the job. And looked as interested but yes those goals are met are based on- again the- some are not implement rates were there the county contains- officer not office. Refusal rate also that we've experienced in the hiring process. Alright some gonna nerd out on you and you can just stop me on that so. I mean there are many ways we're doing a lot of valuation because I know centers can ask about that we're looking at a valuation for- at the macro level of how we're moving. You know attitudes but really the stuff that you're all going to look at is response rates. So if you really look at self response rates verses when they do nor for the knocking on doors were they get the hundred percent. Looking at how the US census bureau nationally says they're gonna target sixty point five. Like they're expecting sixty point five. Percent of households to self respond meeting they do it online they do on the phone what have you that. Before Mar- may first rate. So for me I don't know how far that is because we are facing a lot of unprecedented. Issues so what I would look at is I break it down into time periods because we're we're doing such data intensive work with our partners. And I would look at you obviously have to look at census tracts geography geographically that tower tracking it. We're looking at twenty ten census. Tract rates for those dates so let's just take- a the census tract or here in Long Beach this call it zero zero dash one. We're gonna look at on April first just take a date where were they in twenty ten. In terms of their response rate. And where they now in twenty twenty and we're doing that across the state looking at comparing those so we can get sort of a semi real time look at dashboard wise. And how we're doing. So that's just one Mike when you're talking about response rates now in terms of metrics. I mean how many questions assistance centers DB establish. How many of. How much usage to begin how may touches that we get there because with questioner since centers we're hoping that you know there are a 100% in terms of completion verses like somebody just. Taking something Allen vent. We can look at. Schools using creek. For having it's so important and school takes a long time to get that moving and to change the curriculum and for the first time we have curriculum that's actually made by teachers and accepted for the California standards also looking at social media I mean that's the easiest hits where would how many people are engaging how many people are commenting. So those are just some of the things M. you can get down to the census track to see if were the centrist tractors are point one is at 11% percent response rate on April first and they were at you know 28% last time around we can track it for maybe a couple days to see if because of online and then how to read read to see how to redeploy a Long Beach forward to say Hey look at the census tracks. Go do an event set up a table you know go to whatever you that the minister that's there have them deploy immediately and then see if that's going to change it so that was different about this time our hours are getting real to if you thank- but at the end of you know fifteenth we'll get a snapshot look at where response rates are and then the this group has to make up. And to all those you know only get Sent more possible to get that people can. In center pan. Thank you M. that I appreciate the challenges of especially in a good economy which we do like- and I would point out that actually he. That de should California economy I. she's been consistently growing faster than the rest of the country for many years- and so I think it's testament to California policies and economic growth but that's mental side comment. So the question now I want to cut back the nation right. Well it's also fairly directly straits right okay I'm not going there- the so the question I have to ask for you though is that so I've now I know you're in southern California I'm up in Sacramento and I've been trying to get people to talk about- working for the census to do numeration and I appreciate- the- discussion about. That's a structural issues will have enough enumerators were not going to be able to get to as many people- the thing is some the feedback I get is well earlier on was is that it took a long time for them to even hear D. will hear anything. Right so the plan application they just don't hear anything and- then there are you know they start losing interest in of course looking for other jobs and so forth so. Hopefully as we're getting closer to crunch time that gap in time between city an application and hearing something is closed and isn't as more instantaneous- the other thing though I also here's because we want we have a diverse state and we want a diverse set of enumerators- for example in forty communities of color. We have higher percentages of people who've had a history of conservation no are the record. And to what degree that a barrier to them working for the census right they they want they're looking for work they want to do something. Maybe can speak to that- my guess is that you probably not carried with those of documentation. From me but that's another but the two wives were taking out big chunks large chunks of people out of the pool. So I guess one of the things that went that maybe clarity is that so- how who can apply you know who who who who can be employed by the census to do this work I mean- it's sometimes not clear and I think there's a lot of stuff going around the community about that- and so people. Don't even wanna try is there for you know they think they won't Shotton. They're not so. I think that. You can clarify a not next to sheeting detail given factor hearing comprise more writing but perhaps a broad stroke as to. Who really realistically has a decent chance of getting a job with the senses of the take the time and effort of actually submitting an application. Great so the first thing is who can apply everyone can apply it but yes there are some factors that may be. Made not make us your filter down to a successful employee what does that look like when you apply online we don't have background questions an initial application. So those. Issues are handled on a case by case basis so say somebody has something other can become a criminal background we can't say this offense or this doesn't they take a lot of factors into consideration. Which is to be the time period of what should happen to the extent of whatever the- you know what the issue was. So those are handled by a case by case basis so again everyone can apply when they're hired. The national form that'll probably bring is the declaration for federal employment and so the declaration for federal employment is they do have to disclose. That information and if there's something that warrants additional information this time around they are given up about sixty days to respond to that okay let me let me push back a little bit on this I appreciate you saying well everybody can fly by the way. That could undocumented people it includes and I'm well. I'm just. Hello right yeah they can apply but they may not be eligible now they- know about a meter I mean the things he is able to be applied but for example they don't realistically have a chance of. Getting in like they can provide a social security number and really the answer is no they shouldn't. Right so I'd so I guess and then I get the idea that. Case by case. Basis but the problem is. The feedback I'm getting is that. They realize there isn't like maybe sharp lines. Problem probably the Thursday. The thirtieth but some guidance is helpful because I think there are people who are said well I don't want to. Bother doing this because I don't think I have much of a chance and I can go and tell them well everybody's your of life but- you know people talk to each other and community right I'm trying to be a truck. If I'm going to trust the messenger I got to be communicate to people about realistically. You know if you got these offenses you should definitely so go because there's a good chance they'll still hire you if. You're kind of got involved in something let's say you're his Vidak you know you got felony probably not. You know because people don't want you knocking on the door so I mean I think. Some clear guidance. May actually help to try to communicate this is back to trusted messenger issues right. Questions can I be a trusted messenger I just go and say everybody can apply I'm- I think my trusted part starts going down because I'm not being. Realistic and direct with them. And that's what I kind of. They realize that in Pratt C. official had you can't get but I mean some. That's going to be important to be able to communicate to people M. vertically communities in three communities wanna get numerators from because they'll be best at regionals communities what kind of direction we can give them so is there getting the word out that they can give people. The straight answer so that they can still remain trusted. Right and does it our eligibility questions that they're not getting any finite answers for it because again those are all reviewed on a case by case basis because there's so many factors to those. But yes normally I would use a declaration for federal employment as a guide I anyone can Google that and it'll ask background questions. As far as- if you're you're on probation they go back- five years- there's one question go seven years so that's the base line that the federal government uses. For jobs so if you're giving that information I would direct them to the declaration for federal employment- that's available online that's an office of personnel management form that this in in this is that also available I mean is the you put. That aside from having to only go find- M. B. is that something that's on this it's on the census bureau of personal website which is since the start garbage hiring documents. So it's part a hiring document yes for the hiring document because yes does questions in those things will come into play at the point of hiring when you first apply those questions are not. On the initial application so it does happen at the point of higher now there's some people that you may talk to maybe they had something that happened long time ago or were in when they were younger. And again. Our message should be in the community based organizations to help them complete that information so if there's feedback that's required maybe those coming based organizations can. Help them complete the letter help them clear up anything there's a lot of issues sometimes it's around this information want to clear that up as well. So I think the follow up and again the great job that the committee based organizations are doing it will help people but yes. The normal guide that most federal agencies use is that declaration for federal employment it's on the census dot gov website under hiring documents. And I'm anyone can look Google the declaration for federal employment that a lot these give you the background questions that you're subject. To so that you can be prepared for them. Okay thank you. The seven member Berman. Thank you very much to. Hopefully quick questions the first is. So we- had kind of macro level. Data on- the percent of applicants that we have so far and what the goals are. Is there any kind of more micro level data in terms of in trying to. Find bilingual speakers in certain languages and whether or not we're falling short- in certain communities on. On some of the more specific skill sets that were trying to. You know get with with folks that are applying to be enumerators. That's the first question second questions unrelated toss up there for now. So the language gold we do have our language gold sad to- for the most part we've been meeting those and I can go back to see if we can share those at least most of the language goals were we've said we're at a hundred percent. Okay are meeting our language goals Scott good to know- in the same question as it was kind of misinformation and disinformation which has been a huge concern of mine- on the on the election front but also obviously that applies to the census friends under pan and I doctor Ben and I we- participated in the meeting. Like a year and a half ago now- we're we kind of you had. We were scared straight about that what could happen- as we get up to census day- where is there a process where people can go if they see things out in the community or on social media. That they think are inaccurate- in regards to the census where that- the where they can report something and that information will get filtered up and then maybe it is our plan to communicate with different social media platforms. To make sure that they're pulling things down as quickly as possible if there's misinformation being sprayed on the platforms. Certainly the census bureau headquarters they do have a team that's looking at that looking at social media so any of the negative they pretty much. Are are on it to get those- taken care of- but the phone numbers are listed there and yes- that's the hard part in it applies to jobs as well because everyone that's- Google in at- again if you have a like an eighteen. At the Google everything Sir according to my son I don't work for the census bureau because he Google button he called the wrong office and I don't work there. Right you have to be careful I would say just send everyone to the official website. Twenty twenty census dot gov for information. There's numbers there we have the toll free job find that's on all of the information that they can be transferred to. A we have to be careful with mirror sites- and they've applied ended up applied to the census jobs. My son accidentally. On apply to job had. Questions that we didn't have it has the census bureau logo. Login as much as possible direct them to the official site make sure it has Dodd god at the end. I don't trust anything that says dot com. But yes since you're does have some- things in place in regards to on things it'll come up on social media that they can- attacked directing removed if it's- yeah. Even beyond the whole jobs so I worked as a video online that do you know is a testimonial somebody saying I opened the door to a census taker and- and ice was with them. Right yeah II is there something you know it it will there be. A different go to the senses website will there be a link or a job down or anything that says like. You know if you reporter misinformation that you saw- please is a rumors at census Dodd goes the exam. That they can report it to okay- and then I know at national headquarters working with Dan avoid it like they're actually coming up with the process nationally. Yeah to try Jeff and we're walking at this. Work with it because things that star in New Hampshire. May seem innocuous but- and epidemiology he will want to watch to see. How it spread Richard can see this. So we can inoculate in California yeah against those messages service. Yeah it's the same thing I you know that we saw meddling in elections in like small random south. American countries. Before they metal Marlys. As in twenty sixteen and we can anticipate that they're gonna test things out in other communities- before they- in March you. Will be able to see. What they're doing with our primary as well exactly. Great but we can find out exactly and provide that information to see if it's going to be on their website or if there's gonna be a specific number for this. Person center pan. Asian just follow up. And yet appreciate all the work the census bureau's doing. I'm actually concerned when you said there are mere sites to the census okay. Yeah it's very easy to go. Dot com verses dot gov so that's a really simple straightforward thing to do. And if you can get and I realized- limits to what the federal government can do it since broken do but if you can't solve that problem of like taking down or getting people to pull down your sites are buying up the domain names for those. That's a really straightforward thing to do. And if you can't handle that I am very worried about what happens on the something a lot more sophisticated than that. Okay if you're Denver so short on jobs and- yet we can't keep people from landing on the mere sight. Because they type dot converse dot gov. I mean let's let's hueso selected officials we have to deal with campaigns we have we know you by every dummy site if you can if you have the resources that gets around because you just don't want people. Basically tricking people into going somewhere else and putting out misinformation about you. So I would C. say that if that's really going on and then that's your first test of what you can try to do with this information if you can't get the- the- I. T. community and all the other folks that help you and say look you know what this is misinformation and- people who are applying for the census were desperate trying to get. Are getting diverted and getting their- who knows they're doing it because they're stealing personal ID information whatever reason they're doing it. We can't shut those people down- then we have a big problem because- we don't have a- in and you should be all shut down tomorrow because that's about how fast you go to work when people first hits right if you can't if you takes you couple weeks to shut up and down like that. It's over the game's over it the words already out you know it's only takes a few days for something go viral. And so- I hope that we should be Dodd that. The people who are working on this stuff they should use as perhaps as a test. Case of what they can try to do to mobilize the community the stop misinformation. Yeah and they understand that- the ones for jobs it's job boards like job hats those are the ones that are are kind of a top because they say we have census jobs. And they've got their disclaimers on that but I'm Richard the census bureau is working out to make sure that it's safe and secure. So this is a follow so what's the plan to get rid of those sites. Read them the ones that we had. This would they were like job had to we had for. The G. twenty twenty jobs most people for example the by the key words like job had indeed .com because we do post on them for jobs. But sometimes those. Job boards also. Kind of gather the information on that on some of the applicants. So we- they've got a big campaign in place we bought. Was been a lot of money on key words to make sure that the census bureau was right on top as far as- census jobs. So that kind of happened early on but again. I'm talking about job hot. Indeed dot com will ultimately they do take you to the census bureau website but they're pretty much. Job boards okay so there's no more mirror sites is that right now there's no more mers all right. Then answers the question- a couple things first of all- thank you both for being here you both have. Significant challenges in different ways. Of his Carnegie thank you for your responsiveness we've asked many questions of the course last year and you've been very responsive thank you very much for that- the- where where are we in terms of metrics in terms of enumerators in California. We what. Where are we. So for killing I think I gave the California number open in terms of where you expect to be where are we are at. For California we are at forty four and a half percent what what's reform its metric for this time of year. We expect to be pretty close again this number changes every single day right. So we're below where we expect to be right. So what's the plan in February to accelerate that process we started accelerating our process now again the census bureau put a just now finding and for paid advertisement- increase a goal they've increased our staffing so we have additional recording assistance additional boots on the ground what. How much have we increased our staffing here in California to meet our goal the last California can got back to the actual number but nation I mean for our whole region- we've increased it. By two to three hundred recording assistance I see a six point five million nationwide is so small that it's infinitesimal- and I realize that you're not. Here because you're running the senses for the country but six point five million nationwide is. Is a pebble in the great lake. So is there a plan and if there's not a plan will there be a plan and will you let us know what that plan is because if we're if we're behind by say February were still behind. There in there's no work plan to accelerate recruitment. What what what happens. We've started now again the national campaign is kicking into a D. distilling to our regional efforts we've got the National Kevin going they just started at this week so we've increased all of our recruiting efforts all of our media. Can you let us know when a month where we if not you may be miss Carnegie can let us know where you are in a month and have you reached out to legislative offices I C. reset aggression offices you reset the legislative offices our partnership to. The group that reaches out to legislative office to- engage their support site but yeah we're reaching out and every level of that we can and again there's national partnerships that are taking place as well I don't want to be sarcastic here but I'm- pretty sure no one's reached out to our office I don't know about other members it. Is anybody reach out to your offices from the national. The federal government. Jim. Right what will we'll find out but- just drawing from I'll take that information back thing right right so far as I know- then lastly missed Mr Escovedo testified a little earlier about certain challenges I asked him what his number one challenge was in his number one challenges- I can't remember exactly what he said but something about- the changing rigorous flexibility whatever it may be requirements in if each of you could respond to his comment in and- you know. What to do about it so let me start with miss- Kentucky thank you so- yes FAA Jean was talking about there is a four page guidance that came out about how can committee great bit based groups help on the ground- any in that particular document there were two references to it's against federal law to do phone you know to do phone banking or to call folks robo calls and it's against the law- I think it was to- to give a tablet at the door and so our lawyers owns long as as well as some other. Advocates lawyers have been looking at that and they cannot find the federal we've asked for the federal law that it's against- and so that's where I think there's some angst at least from our office as well as a lot of our partners like a train because you're giving it this guidance but it's not state in any law at if you know it so that's part of it is how do we interpret that- and so we're in the process of trying to Askar lorries how do we interpret it if it's there's nothing enter Brett. I think that's where the AG's office been formed- I'm not sure I'll have to probably should now all of this is last call for drinks or whether we're being kicked. Out but the it's are going off on so let me let me just. I don't want to stop your response yeah if you're finished them M. turned ms Connell. What what are your thoughts on Mr excavators testimony. I don't know if I got it's disappointing because I did a step back but can you just kind of give me what he said was is I. S. was biggest challenge and what he said was biggest challenges that. And I'm paraphrasing now is that the requirements of the federal government one seem to be inconsistent with- what they understand is standard practice so for example making phone calls. In that they keep changing so I. Is that does that do any visibility on that. Does that relate to our employees working with the census can you that that relates to so for example if I'm running community based organization I want to make phone calls to people to community. After you know April ten I see that a certain precinct is not being responsive. So if I wanna make phone calls to individuals in that precinct. According to- I guess the latest guidance that's a violation of federal law. However that doesn't seem to be. The that there's at least ambiguity there so. Do you have any comment on that. I don't have any comment on that I have to check I think what we need to do is get that resolved and maybe maybe the AG's office can help us get that results so. Okay thank you very much- I I. most grateful let me thank the Senate assembly staff that are here. I know it is a- challenge to have hearings outside the state capitol in a most grateful for your support. And also most grateful for the support of the city of Long Beach and providing- buses facility in hosting. And I think with that we will be adjourned for. Time being. I'm sorry I'm sorry yes you're right you're absolutely right yes. Let me let me you're right so let me let me take public comment here. Right so if you come up. And you'd identify if we could actually as people line up so I could just have some sort of visuals to those who wish to testify. And then- if you could identify yourself if you're with an organization- and where you live that would be most useful- and I'm gonna ask that we limit ourselves to two minutes each. Thanks very much can you hear me yes we checked as I mazing this I'm I'm syllabus got on the director of community relations for Santa Ana unified school district I'm also a resident of Santana. I like to thank you for the opportunity to speak today- I'd like to state that Santa Ana unified has been engaged in the census is twenty seventeen with Natalie- and Moorlach and it is Ben. A part of our focus for the last year to ensure that we are supporting our community and ensuring that we're all counted. This year we have committed my staff- over forty staff members to be supporting the practice of family and community engagement through that. The active engagement with our families to make them aware of what the census is and how to support him today as a matter of fact I had over forty of them we C. professional development with the Orange County department of education. And we've committed to ensuring that fifty seven of our wellness centers one at each one of our schools is going to be supporting. Not only information and professional development for staff but information for the community we are open to everyone a community one of the things that I wanted to state as that in September. The district. In collaboration with them many of the complete count committees that we engage in- we start proclamation the census and all the parts that were in de committing to it. And I wanted to see one thing that is really concerned as the past couple of weeks. In November we- what bands. The P. for the county at. Orange however not a week ago we were sadly M. informed that along with the city of Santana. Our award letter had been rescinded so I'm gonna ask for your support in that. Because we're still committed and one of the reasons that is the district we're asking for this is to ensure that. All fifty seven centers are open after hours so that. Access to them to all those other families who are probably working multiple jobs have access to that. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you good afternoon my name is doctor my phone when I am here representing multiple organization an intersection Allen D. it's who I am I'm an ambassador in that I am trilingual in the enemy Spanish and English doctor pan knows me very well because I've served on the CMA for the ethnic medical organization section as the vice chair. I wanted to speak to your multiple wonderful testimonial givers- there are three populations that I didn't hear as trusted messengers positions- currently I am a house call physicians to our elderly who do not speak English mainly Latino and Vietnamese it's a perfect opportunity we need to outreach to our physician members Dr pan through the lack Monning LA county medical association- CME- you need to put us to work Dr- lastly it's huge about ethnic media I did not hear- proper.

A good afternoon my name is Joseph vigil of I'm the director of policy and advocacy which should let the coalition for humane immigrant rights to listen to this offers let me start by thanking you for doing for you I'm going efforts to make sure that we reach the heart to count communities but also to your staff and they governor staff that have had several conversations with us as relates to what some of the best practices. For several years will be working and getting ready- ourselves but then also to advocate for resource as but that's not also increase partnership with- with spices with goals by sponsoring a B. six except without assemblywoman. Radius that ensure that schools are part of the effort. Care less six to leverage the leverage I'm sorry. Its presence in the Inland Empire Orange County. LA county and to Lara Connie to implement the census and want to partner to with many. Organizations as well but one of the things that we're noticing at one of the challenges the is that. This bill resource game two to CBO's. As we hear of they feel they feel employment they should we want to make sure that. Ted the latest by J. de twenty seven be about million dollars. Allocated for CBS actually get to the communities before I. At January January first is that we that the plans are fully implemented. But the second thing that I also wanna- highlight ease the- the ongoing effort by the trump administration to actually suppress. The participation of the census of one of the key aspect is thick islands. That were mentioned by Mister Frankel those are something that we're trying to really figure out in Washington DC what's the purpose of it. Given the fact that actually tried the X. and the thing died in the US census really early on. And so we're really trying to figure out and the fact that when we trying to analyze with the statue the federal statute does not make any sense. As it relates that's waiting one is up to your office the governor's office but knows that the AG's office to really push for clarification. As it relates to that. Lastly as as as as we move forward on the- there's one eight things that usually stick to do is to. Decide. I reject in a in a and coach. Says anyway and so by using holidays and that's something that we will reach out to. Your offices to trying to get the help and with that we appreciate all the work. Thank you. Thank you very much.

As we've heard today since hiring California is urgently behind more since his job applicants are still needed than can fit in the staples center to continue the metaphor of today. Approximately forty thousand candidates in el Los Angeles county according to the data share today and tens of thousands more in California. California must act now to make sure that there are enough enumerators hired. Recruiting department. Recruiting and helping get hired more qualified local candidates is potentially one of the highest impacts a community member can have today the government an organization or an individual as each is tasked with counting three hundred people in a community community can I close my organization has developed our field staff recruiter with input from the census bureau to address hiring problems such as the long opaque in leaky federal hiring process starting with the application that must be completed online in one sitting. The process includes additional assets has an appointment for fingerprinting or submission of selective service information the field staff recruiter is a mobile messaging solution Taylor to engage and support candidates from local hard count communities to the online application in hiring processes by providing brief training videos automatically remind candidates to complete the application and updating them about the status of their application it's easily distributed by statewide by regional networks for schools nonprofits and government agencies.
