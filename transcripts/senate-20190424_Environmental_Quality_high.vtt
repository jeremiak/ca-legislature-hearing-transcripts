SB FIFTY NINE THIS IS ITEM.

00:00:18.051 --> 00:00:34.734
NUMBER FOUR IN YOUR POCKET

00:00:40.607 --> 00:00:40.840
[inaudible]

00:00:40.907 --> 00:00:43.143
SENATOR ALLEN.

00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:44.911
THANK YOU THANK YOU A MEASURE

00:00:44.978 --> 00:00:47.514
MEMBERS SO I THE INTRODUCTION OF

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.482
AUTONOMOUS PASSENGER VEHICLES ON

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:51.651
TO OUR ROADS AND WITHIN OUR

00:00:51.718 --> 00:00:52.185
COMMUNITIES.

00:00:52.252 --> 00:00:52.652
HAS THE POTENTIAL TO

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:54.053
REVOLUTIONIZE THE WAY THAT WE

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.922
GET AROUND AND HOW WE RESHAPE

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:57.323
OUR COMMUNITIES NOW IT'S

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:58.792
INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGY.

00:00:58.858 --> 00:01:00.126
I AND THERE'S A LOT OF POTENTIAL

00:01:00.193 --> 00:01:01.828
BENEFITS READY COULD DRASTICALLY

00:01:01.895 --> 00:01:03.062
REDUCE COLLISIONS AND ENHANCE

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:04.497
TRAFFIC FLOW.

00:01:04.564 --> 00:01:06.933
THAT'S ALL VERY PROMISING -- BUT

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.301
OF COURSE IF NOT FIVE FULLY

00:01:08.368 --> 00:01:10.470
DEPLOYED -- THIS NEW MOBILITY

00:01:10.537 --> 00:01:12.372
REVOLUTION COULD HAVE

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:13.606
SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE IMPACTS

00:01:13.673 --> 00:01:14.841
POTENTIALLY INCLUDING

00:01:14.908 --> 00:01:17.410
EXACERBATING CLIMATE AIR QUALITY

00:01:17.477 --> 00:01:19.412
PLANNING CONGESTION CHALLENGES.

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:20.346
ARE THE REASON WHY I SAY THAT IS

00:01:20.413 --> 00:01:21.848
THERE'S BEEN SOME RECENT STUDIES

00:01:21.915 --> 00:01:23.683
THAT HAVE FOUND THAT -- BECAUSE

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.819
A VIS POTENTIALLY MAKE TRAVEL

00:01:25.885 --> 00:01:27.120
LESS ONEROUS THEIR WIDESPREAD

00:01:27.187 --> 00:01:29.289
ADOPTION COULD ACTUALLY INCREASE.

00:01:29.355 --> 00:01:31.624
VEHICLE TRAVEL ARE.

00:01:31.691 --> 00:01:33.560
BY A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT.

00:01:33.626 --> 00:01:34.594
I THERE WAS AN EXPERIMENT WAS

00:01:34.661 --> 00:01:36.496
CONDUCTED BY PROFESSORS AT UC

00:01:36.563 --> 00:01:38.064
DAVIS AT BERKELEY GEORGE ATTACK

00:01:38.131 --> 00:01:39.566
THE MIMIC LIFE WITH ANY V.

00:01:39.632 --> 00:01:40.700
BASICALLY PROVIDING.

00:01:40.767 --> 00:01:41.501
YOU KNOW EACH PARTICIPATING

00:01:41.568 --> 00:01:43.269
HOUSEHOLD WITH A SHOW FOR AND

00:01:43.336 --> 00:01:43.803
THE EXPERIMENT SAW THAT

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:46.272
HOUSEHOLDS TRAVEL EIGHTY THREE

00:01:46.339 --> 00:01:46.439
M..

00:01:46.506 --> 00:01:49.209
PERCENT MORE MILES PER WEEK WITH

00:01:49.275 --> 00:01:50.143
MORE THAN A FIFTH OF THE VEHICLE

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:51.778
TRIPS CARRYING NO PASSENGERS.

00:01:51.845 --> 00:01:53.413
I WHEN THEY HAVE YOU KNOW THE

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.849
OPTION OF OF A COMMERCIAL FOR

00:01:55.915 --> 00:01:56.749
TRAVEL [inaudible]

00:01:56.816 --> 00:01:57.717
SO.

00:01:57.784 --> 00:01:58.918
YES THE POINT IS I THERE IS

00:01:58.985 --> 00:02:00.420
INCREDIBLE PROMISE ASSOCIATE

00:02:00.487 --> 00:02:02.655
WITH A VIS BUT THE QUESTION IS --

00:02:02.722 --> 00:02:04.557
IF IT'S NOT DONE RIGHT IT COULD

00:02:04.624 --> 00:02:06.626
ACTUALLY MAKE PROBLEMS WORSE.

00:02:06.693 --> 00:02:08.061
AND SO ARE.

YOU KNOW.

00:02:09.696 --> 00:02:10.630
ALL WE'RE TRYING TO DO WITH THIS

00:02:10.697 --> 00:02:13.032
BILL IS LOOK AT THIS ISSUE WE'VE

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:15.001
LOOKED A LOT OF SAFETY ISSUES.

00:02:15.068 --> 00:02:16.202
WITH THE REST AB THAT'S BEEN

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:17.470
WHERE A LOT OF THE FOCUS IS

00:02:17.537 --> 00:02:18.538
SPEND BUT THERE'S A WHOLE SLEW

00:02:18.605 --> 00:02:20.173
OF BROADER SOCIETAL IMPLICATIONS

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.141
ASSOCIATED WITH WITH THE ROLL

00:02:22.208 --> 00:02:23.443
OUT OF AB SO.

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:24.244
THIS CREATES AN INTERAGENCY

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.613
GROUP TO TO DELIBERATELY PLAN

00:02:26.679 --> 00:02:28.214
FOR AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES IN A WAY

00:02:28.281 --> 00:02:29.983
THAT SUPPORTS OUR PLANNING.

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:31.651
ARE SENATE BILL THE GOALS WITH

00:02:31.718 --> 00:02:32.986
THE MIND TOWARD AVOIDING

00:02:33.052 --> 00:02:34.420
POTENTIAL NEGATIVE IMPACTS ME

THAT WE DELIVER THE PLAN.

00:02:40.527 --> 00:02:42.562
WILL NOT SIGNING WHAT COULD BE A

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:43.730

CALIFORNIA.

00:03:23.903 --> 00:03:25.138
WHETHER THIS STATE IS READY OR

00:03:25.204 --> 00:03:26.506
NOT AUTOMATED VEHICLES ARE HERE

00:03:26.573 --> 00:03:27.740
AND THEY'RE POISED TO TRANSFORM

00:03:27.807 --> 00:03:29.208

BUT SINCE IT IS SUCH A NEW

00:03:44.591 --> 00:03:46.292
TECHNOLOGY WE ARE JUST GUESSING

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:48.061
AND WE DON'T KNOW WHAT EXACTLY

VIEW ABOUT THE FUTURE AUTOMATED

00:03:59.706 --> 00:04:01.874
VEHICLES THE BENEFITS A CONCERNS

00:04:01.941 --> 00:04:03.309
MUCH LIKE THAT MUCH LIKE WAS

00:04:03.376 --> 00:04:04.844
DONE LAST YEAR -- ON ON THE

BUT THERE ARE STILL MORE

00:04:10.316 --> 00:04:12.051
QUESTIONS THAN ANSWERS.

00:04:12.118 --> 00:04:13.553
HOW WILL AUTOMATED VEHICLES

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:14.520
AFFECT VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED IN

00:19:50.188 --> 00:19:52.591
ON THEIR PLASTIC RECYCLING SPENT

00:19:52.658 --> 00:19:54.393
FOUR YEARS FIVE YEARS TRYING TO

00:19:54.459 --> 00:19:56.028
COME UP WITH SOMETHING AND JUST

00:19:56.094 --> 00:19:57.963
ENJOY IN OCTOBER OR NOVEMBER

00:19:58.030 --> 00:20:00.566
THEY GOT A DEAL THAT THEY HAVE

00:20:00.632 --> 00:20:00.832
AND THAT.

00:20:00.899 --> 00:20:02.568
PRESUMABLY BECAUSE THE STAFF

00:20:02.634 --> 00:20:03.969
REPORT TALKS ABOUT OUT OF STATE

00:20:04.036 --> 00:20:06.471
COMPLIANCE AND IT APPEARS THAT

00:20:06.538 --> 00:20:07.873
IF THE U. THEY IF.

00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:09.041
IF THE TOBACCO INDUSTRY AND THE

00:20:09.107 --> 00:20:10.876
PLASTIC FILTER INDUSTRY HAS TO

00:20:10.943 --> 00:20:14.780
DO THIS IN EUROPE IT SEEM LIKE

00:20:14.846 --> 00:20:16.582
THIS WOULD BE A WAVE.

00:20:16.648 --> 00:20:17.749
THE PARALLEL COULD DISCUSSIONS

00:20:17.816 --> 00:20:18.750
AND YOU HAD SAID THAT WOULD MAKE

00:20:18.817 --> 00:20:19.952
EMINENTLY GOOD SENSE THE SENATOR

00:20:20.018 --> 00:20:22.154
AND MY HOPE IS THAT THE TOBACCO

00:20:22.220 --> 00:20:23.755
INDUSTRY WILL.

00:20:23.822 --> 00:20:26.158
RECOGNIZE THAT IN THAT WE CAN

00:20:26.224 --> 00:20:27.426
HAVE THOSE DISCUSSIONS AND COME

00:20:27.492 --> 00:20:29.261
UP WITH THE SPECIFIC SOLUTION

00:20:29.328 --> 00:20:30.862
RIGHT NOW WE ARE.

00:20:30.929 --> 00:20:32.898
ABOUT TO HAVE MEETINGS WITH THEM

00:20:32.965 --> 00:20:34.800
THE BRING THEM TO THE TABLE -- I

00:20:34.866 --> 00:20:37.603
FEEL VERY CONFIDENT THOUGH THAT.

00:20:37.669 --> 00:20:39.538
SHOULD DO WE AS A LEGISLATURE

00:20:39.605 --> 00:20:43.508
MAKE CLEAR THAT THEY HAVE GOT.

00:20:43.575 --> 00:20:43.775
TO HELP.

00:20:43.842 --> 00:20:45.844
AND IN TAKE SOME RESPONSIBILITY

00:20:45.911 --> 00:20:46.878
FOR THIS ISSUE.

00:20:46.945 --> 00:20:48.347
THAT THEY WILL COME TO THE TABLE

00:20:48.413 --> 00:20:49.748
IF THEY KNOW THEY HAVE TO AND

00:20:49.815 --> 00:20:51.183
THAT'S BASICALLY WHAT WE'RE

00:20:51.249 --> 00:20:53.352
ASKING IS THAT WE MAKE IT CLEAR

00:20:53.418 --> 00:20:53.852
THAT THEY'VE GOT THAT

00:20:53.919 --> 00:20:55.020
RESPONSIBILITY.

00:20:55.087 --> 00:20:56.688
AND I AM VERY HAPPY TO WORK WITH

00:20:56.755 --> 00:20:59.591
THEM TO ACHIEVE THE BEST.

00:20:59.658 --> 00:21:01.560
APPROACH TO RESOLVING THIS

00:21:01.627 --> 00:21:02.961
PROBLEM AND HAVING THEM.

00:21:03.028 --> 00:21:05.263
ESSENTIALLY TAKE THE LEAD IN

00:21:05.330 --> 00:21:06.431
FIGURING OUT HOW TO DO IT THAT'S

00:21:06.498 --> 00:21:07.399
WHAT WE DID WITH THE

00:21:07.466 --> 00:21:10.235
PHARMACEUTICAL ISSUE -- AND A

00:21:10.302 --> 00:21:11.603
BEGIN WITH THE E. F. THE

00:21:11.670 --> 00:21:13.305
EUROPEAN UNION HAS A SYSTEM THAT

00:21:13.372 --> 00:21:15.607
WORKS I'M VERY INTERESTED IN HOW

00:21:15.674 --> 00:21:16.742
WE CAN APPLY THAT HERE IN

00:21:16.808 --> 00:21:18.076
CALIFORNIA I'M NOT.

00:21:18.143 --> 00:21:19.478
I DON'T WANT TO GET INTO THE

00:21:19.544 --> 00:21:21.146
LITTLE DETAILS BECAUSE THEY KNOW

00:21:21.213 --> 00:21:22.714
THIS INDUSTRY BETTER BUT THE

00:21:22.781 --> 00:21:25.584
RESULTS ARE RESULTS THAT I AM

00:21:25.651 --> 00:21:26.618
HOPEFUL THAT THIS LEGISLATURE

00:21:26.685 --> 00:21:28.053
WILL MAKE CLEAR.

00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:30.088
THAT ARE THE POLICY THE STATE

00:21:30.155 --> 00:21:30.622
AND THAT THEY WILL THEN

00:21:30.689 --> 00:21:32.591
IMPLEMENT THEM.

00:21:32.658 --> 00:21:33.792
IN AND IN A WAY THAT WORKS FOR

00:21:33.859 --> 00:21:34.926
ALL OF US.

00:21:34.993 --> 00:21:36.428
AND THEN MISTER CHAIR THE LAST

00:21:36.495 --> 00:21:37.529
QUESTION THIS.

00:21:37.596 --> 00:21:39.665
ART NAY SENT LEGAL MARIJUANA

00:21:39.731 --> 00:21:43.635
INDUSTRY THAT -- WE'VE GOT A LOT

00:21:43.702 --> 00:21:45.137
OF THIS IS THIS LEGISLATURE'S

00:21:45.203 --> 00:21:45.937
NOT SHORT ON NEW REGULATIONS ON

00:21:46.004 --> 00:21:47.572
HOW WE BELIEVE WE CAN REGULATE

00:21:47.639 --> 00:21:48.306
POT.

00:21:48.373 --> 00:21:50.542
YOU KNOW AND AT AND AND DO THAT

00:21:50.609 --> 00:21:52.644
THIS EXTENDS TO THOSE.

00:21:52.711 --> 00:21:54.846
A SINGLE USE THIS IS NOT BONGS

00:21:54.913 --> 00:21:56.348
AND PIPES THIS IS.

00:21:56.415 --> 00:21:58.150
NO THIS IS SINGLE USE REGARDLESS

00:21:58.216 --> 00:21:59.718
OF WHAT THE PRODUCT IS THAT'S

00:21:59.785 --> 00:22:01.119
BEING SMOKED WITHIN IT SO IT

00:22:01.186 --> 00:22:02.654
WOULD HAVE FLOOR IT WOULD APPLY

00:22:02.721 --> 00:22:04.222
TO SINGLE USE.

00:22:04.289 --> 00:22:06.291
MARIJUANA CIGARETTES.

00:22:06.358 --> 00:22:08.126
ARE I CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT THEY

00:22:08.193 --> 00:22:10.796
WOULD LOOK LIKE BUT ARE A IT

00:22:10.862 --> 00:22:12.230
DOES APPLY TO THE RECEPTACLE.

00:22:12.297 --> 00:22:14.533
REGARDLESS OF WHAT IS BEING

00:22:14.599 --> 00:22:15.801
SMOKED WITHIN IT.

00:22:15.867 --> 00:22:18.570
OKAY I'M I'M JUST.

00:22:18.637 --> 00:22:20.205
HI I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY COME TO

00:22:20.272 --> 00:22:22.908
THE TABLE.

00:22:22.974 --> 00:22:24.042
WELL I I THINK.

00:22:24.109 --> 00:22:25.310
YOU KNOW I DON'T.

00:22:25.377 --> 00:22:27.546
I DON'T KNOW HOW THE INVASION

00:22:27.612 --> 00:22:29.147
SMOKING POT.

00:22:29.214 --> 00:22:32.617
IS A TOBACCO TYPE PRODUCT OF

00:22:32.684 --> 00:22:34.186
DIFFERENTLY THAN.

00:22:34.252 --> 00:22:35.754
THE TOBACCO INDUSTRY ITSELF I

00:22:35.821 --> 00:22:37.389
MEAN.

00:22:37.456 --> 00:22:39.291
WE HAVEN'T SEEN THIS BEFORE BUT

00:22:39.357 --> 00:22:40.525
BETTER TO START THEM RIGHT AT

00:22:40.592 --> 00:22:42.594
THE BEGINNING I WOULD SUGGEST.

00:22:42.661 --> 00:22:43.862
THEN HAVE THEM CREATE SOMETHING

00:22:43.929 --> 00:22:45.497
AND THEN WE SAY NO THAT ISN'T

00:22:45.564 --> 00:22:47.499
GOING TO WORK TO HAVE THEM IN AT

00:22:47.566 --> 00:22:49.601
THE GROUND LEVEL I THINK IS.

00:22:49.668 --> 00:22:51.403
IS HELPFUL TO THEM AS WELL.

00:22:51.470 --> 00:22:53.672
SO THEY RECOGNIZED THAT SINGLE

00:22:53.739 --> 00:22:57.576
USE THIS THE DISPOSABLE OF

00:22:57.642 --> 00:22:58.543
MARIJUANA BOX OR WHATEVER

00:22:58.610 --> 00:22:59.945
THEY'RE GOING TO CALL THEM.

00:23:00.011 --> 00:23:01.446
ARE NOT ACCEPTABLE EITHER.

00:23:01.513 --> 00:23:02.981
I'M I'M WHAT I'M WORRIED ABOUT

00:23:03.048 --> 00:23:04.683
IS THAT THERE'S BEEN A SOMEWHAT

00:23:04.750 --> 00:23:05.784
OF AN OVERLOAD WITH THE STATE

00:23:05.851 --> 00:23:07.919
LEGISLATURE I'M PASSING VARIETY

00:23:07.986 --> 00:23:09.454
OF BILLS TO REGULATE THIS

00:23:09.521 --> 00:23:11.323
COMMUNITY THAT HAS NEVER BEEN

00:23:11.389 --> 00:23:12.190
REGULATED.

00:23:12.257 --> 00:23:14.025
AND I'D THE IDEA OF THEM

00:23:14.092 --> 00:23:15.560
PARTICIPATING IN THE EXTENT OF

00:23:15.627 --> 00:23:16.928
PRODUCE RESPONSIBILITY WHICH IS

00:23:16.995 --> 00:23:19.998
ON THE INTELLECTUAL LEVEL I I

00:23:20.065 --> 00:23:22.067
GET BUT I JUST JUST SPOTTING THE

00:23:22.134 --> 00:23:23.435
ISSUES STAFF IS -- BUT IT IS

00:23:23.502 --> 00:23:25.103
JUST ONE OF THOSE.

00:23:25.170 --> 00:23:27.205
AND AGAIN -- IF THEY COME TO THE

00:23:27.272 --> 00:23:30.008
IF THEY'LL COME TO THE TABLE AND

00:23:30.075 --> 00:23:30.509
TELL US.

00:23:30.575 --> 00:23:31.109
WHAT THEIR CONCERNS ARE WITH

00:23:31.176 --> 00:23:33.011
THEIR NEEDS ARE IN A PROPOSAL TO

00:23:33.078 --> 00:23:34.546
RESOLVE THE PROBLEM I'M

00:23:34.613 --> 00:23:36.748
COMPLETELY OPEN AND AND ACTUALLY

00:23:36.815 --> 00:23:37.749
INTERESTED IN?

00:23:37.816 --> 00:23:40.452
IN THEIR THEIR PERSPECTIVE

00:23:40.519 --> 00:23:40.752
[inaudible]

00:23:40.819 --> 00:23:43.655
OKAY.

00:23:43.722 --> 00:23:44.289
GREAT ALL RIGHT OTHER QUESTIONS

00:23:44.356 --> 00:23:45.590
THOUGHTS [inaudible]

00:23:45.657 --> 00:23:47.559
YEP SUPERVISOR.

00:23:47.626 --> 00:23:49.594
THE PERSON.

00:23:49.661 --> 00:23:51.296
WHO POSSESSES THE?

00:23:51.363 --> 00:23:52.731
CIGARETTE WITH A FILTER ON IT

00:23:52.798 --> 00:23:54.966
NAY BOUGHT IT IN ANOTHER STATE.

00:23:55.033 --> 00:23:57.769
YOU KNOW THE BODY YEAR SUPPLY

00:23:57.836 --> 00:23:58.837
THAT'S POSSIBLE.

00:23:58.904 --> 00:23:59.504
SO THERE'S NOTHING ABOUT THE

00:23:59.571 --> 00:24:00.705
POSSESSION OF A SINGLE USE

00:24:00.772 --> 00:24:02.941
FILTER IN THOSE OR CIGARETTES

00:24:03.008 --> 00:24:06.378
BASICALLY THE FILTER TIP.

00:24:06.444 --> 00:24:07.412
YES HOW SOME OF THESE BANDS

00:24:07.479 --> 00:24:08.980
PRODUCT FROM YOU WELL WHAT WE'RE

00:24:09.047 --> 00:24:10.582
LOOKING AT THE MANUFACTURER.

00:24:10.649 --> 00:24:13.385
THAT'S REALLY THE BEST AND THE

00:24:13.451 --> 00:24:15.187
MOST BROAD BASED WAY TO DEAL

00:24:15.253 --> 00:24:16.354
WITH THE PROBLEM IS THE

00:24:16.421 --> 00:24:18.590
MANUFACTURER OF THE PRODUCT.

00:24:18.657 --> 00:24:20.258
SO SOMEONE HAS POSSESSION OF

00:24:20.325 --> 00:24:21.693
THEM I DON'T THINK WE'VE

00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:23.495
ADDRESSED THEIR POSSESSION I

00:24:23.562 --> 00:24:24.896
DON'T THINK THAT'S WHAT WE'RE

00:24:24.963 --> 00:24:26.731
LOOKING FOR WE JUST WANT. TO

00:24:26.798 --> 00:24:29.301
CLOSE OUT THE USE OF THIS

00:24:29.367 --> 00:24:30.969
PRODUCT IN THE MANUFACTURING

00:24:31.036 --> 00:24:31.937
PROCESS.

00:24:32.003 --> 00:24:33.905
I GUESS WHAT I'M SAYING SENATOR

00:24:33.972 --> 00:24:34.840
JACKSON IS THAT THEY COULD JUST

00:24:34.906 --> 00:24:35.307
STOP.

00:24:35.373 --> 00:24:36.508
PRODUCING IN THE STATE OF

00:24:36.575 --> 00:24:38.376
CALIFORNIA AND YOU CAN JUST RUN

00:24:38.443 --> 00:24:39.744
ACROSS THE BORDER TO GET IN THE

00:24:39.811 --> 00:24:40.912
NEXT GO WHERE.

00:24:40.979 --> 00:24:45.383
IF IF THEY'RE NOT GONNA COME TO

00:24:45.450 --> 00:24:48.053
THE TABLE AND HAVE A DISCUSSION.

00:24:48.119 --> 00:24:49.421
SO I'M NOT SURE THAT THE PAST

00:24:49.487 --> 00:24:50.021
MIGHT NOT BE THERE AND I AM

00:24:50.088 --> 00:24:51.857
CERTAIN ISSUE CONTINUE TO WORK

00:24:51.923 --> 00:24:52.224
ON IT.

00:24:52.290 --> 00:24:52.858
BUT IF YOU'RE A MAJOR CIGARETTE

00:24:52.924 --> 00:24:53.825
MANUFACTURER AND YOU HAVE TO

00:24:53.892 --> 00:24:55.293
CHANGE.

00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:57.796
THE WAY YOU -- MAKE A CIGARETTE

00:24:57.863 --> 00:25:00.332
WITH THE ATTACHED FILTER ON IT

00:25:00.398 --> 00:25:01.499
THE HOUSE OF THIS PLASTIC

00:25:01.566 --> 00:25:04.736
COMPONENTS.

00:25:04.803 --> 00:25:08.506
NON BY BY AGRADABLE -- THEN

00:25:08.573 --> 00:25:10.175
YOU'RE. TO CHANGE YOUR ENTIRE

00:25:10.242 --> 00:25:11.843
WAY YOU MANUFACTURE CIGARETTES

00:25:11.910 --> 00:25:13.144
TO MY SAY FORGET I'LL JUST

00:25:13.211 --> 00:25:14.379
SOLOMON MEXICO AND OTHER STATES

00:25:14.446 --> 00:25:15.947
AND THEN PEOPLE WHO STILL SMOKE

00:25:16.014 --> 00:25:17.616
I MEAN IT MIGHT BE A DETERRENT --

00:25:17.682 --> 00:25:19.351
YOU KNOW IN YOUR HAND DIRECT

00:25:19.417 --> 00:25:21.186
BENEFIT A DETERRENT TO SMOKING.

00:25:21.253 --> 00:25:22.187
THEN PEOPLE HAVEN'T BECAUSE

00:25:22.254 --> 00:25:27.659
THERE'S NOTHING ABOUT POSSESSING.

00:25:27.726 --> 00:25:29.995
THE EMILY K. IF I BUY THEM --

00:25:30.061 --> 00:25:31.129
LET'S SAY I GO OUT OF STATE GET

00:25:31.196 --> 00:25:32.697
THEM AND I GIVE THEM TO A FRIEND.

00:25:32.764 --> 00:25:33.999
DOWN THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING

00:25:34.065 --> 00:25:36.368
THAT YOU KNOW I KNOW GUILTY OF

00:25:36.434 --> 00:25:37.502
CONFIDE HAVE.

00:25:37.569 --> 00:25:38.603
SHARED IT WITH THE PLAN I THINK

00:25:38.670 --> 00:25:39.838
DOUBTS IN THERE BUT NOT JUST

00:25:39.905 --> 00:25:41.773
POSSESSING IT MYSELF.

00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:43.074
AND I I'M I'M ONLY ASKING THE

00:25:43.141 --> 00:25:44.709
QUESTION I'M ASKING YOU TO FIND

00:25:44.776 --> 00:25:46.378
AN ANSWER TODAY.

00:25:46.444 --> 00:25:48.280
THAT SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE

00:25:48.346 --> 00:25:49.648
DISCUSSED WITH THOSE WHO

00:25:49.714 --> 00:25:51.316
MANUFACTURE CIGARETTES THE MAJOR

00:25:51.383 --> 00:25:56.354
ON TOBACCO COMPANIES AND HOW. TO

00:25:56.421 --> 00:25:57.522
GET THEM TO THE TABLE TO DISCUSS

00:25:57.589 --> 00:25:58.223
THESE THINGS REALLY IMPORTANT

00:25:58.290 --> 00:25:59.391
ABSOLUTELY.

00:25:59.457 --> 00:26:03.561
ABSOLUTELY I AGREE -- AS FAR AS

00:26:03.628 --> 00:26:05.563
THE THE USUAL WELL I WON'T SELL

00:26:05.630 --> 00:26:07.632
IN CALIFORNIA WERE SUCH A LARGE

00:26:07.699 --> 00:26:09.334
ECONOMY -- THOSE ARGUMENTS WERE

METAL CONTAINING JEWELRY Là TO

00:29:31.970 --> 00:29:33.104
BETTER REFLECT THE CURRENT AND

00:29:33.171 --> 00:29:35.707
WIDELY ACCEPTED SCIENCE ON THE

00:29:47.952 --> 00:29:48.820
IT'S COMMON KNOWLEDGE THAT

00:29:48.887 --> 00:29:50.788
EXPOSURE TO LEAD CAUSES REAL AND

00:29:50.855 --> 00:29:52.724
PERMANENT HARM THERE ARE VOLUMES

00:29:52.790 --> 00:29:54.159
OF STUDIES IN THE MANY SOURCES

00:29:54.225 --> 00:29:55.527
OF LEAD EXPOSURE IN THE LONG

00:29:55.593 --> 00:29:56.928
TERM CONSEQUENCES.

00:29:56.995 --> 00:29:58.830
WHAT IS LESS WELL KNOWN IS THAT

00:29:58.897 --> 00:30:00.565
LEAD IS A COMMON INGREDIENT IN

00:30:00.632 --> 00:30:01.533
JEWELRY?

00:30:01.599 --> 00:30:03.601
AND ALSO THAT CADMIUM IS ANOTHER

00:30:03.668 --> 00:30:05.737
TOXIC METAL COMMONLY FOUND IN

00:30:05.803 --> 00:30:07.071

00:30:14.812 --> 00:30:15.914
WELL ESTABLISHED.

00:30:15.980 --> 00:30:18.082
SINCE THEN THE SCIENCES IMPROVE

00:30:18.149 --> 00:30:19.717
AND IT'S BECOME ABUNDANTLY CLEAR

00:30:19.784 --> 00:30:21.519
THAT CALIFORNIA'S LAW IS

00:30:21.586 --> 00:30:23.221

00:30:33.264 --> 00:30:34.132
MEASURED UPDATE TO THE LAW THAT

TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION THE

00:32:38.022 --> 00:32:39.557
STUDIES THAT SHOW THAT IT COULD

00:32:39.624 --> 00:32:41.526
LEAD -- TO LEAD EXPOSURE CAN

00:32:41.592 --> 00:32:43.061
LEAD TO EARLY MENOPAUSE OR

00:32:43.127 --> 00:32:46.230
HEALTH ISSUES POST MENOPAUSE.

00:32:46.297 --> 00:32:47.332
AND SO THESE ARE VERY

00:32:47.398 --> 00:32:49.801
SIGNIFICANT ISSUES AND MULTIPLE

00:32:49.867 --> 00:32:53.471
JURISDICTIONS -- SEEING THE FLOW

00:32:53.538 --> 00:32:55.173
OF ESPECIALLY FROM CHINA --

00:32:55.239 --> 00:32:57.241
CHEAP JEWELRY THAT HAS HIGH

00:32:57.308 --> 00:32:58.109
LEVELS OF LEAD AND CADMIUM

00:32:58.176 --> 00:32:59.577
MULTIPLE JURISDICTIONS HAVE

00:32:59.644 --> 00:33:01.546
ADOPTED STANDARDS TO REGULATE

00:33:01.612 --> 00:33:02.046
THIS.

00:33:02.113 --> 00:33:03.214
THE ATTORNEY GENERAL BROUGHT --

00:33:03.281 --> 00:33:06.317
THE CASE AGAINST SEVERAL JEWELRY --

00:33:06.384 --> 00:33:08.586

00:33:08.653 --> 00:33:10.021
DECADES AGO.

00:33:10.088 --> 00:33:11.456
AND THAT CASE LED TO THE STATE

00:33:11.522 --> 00:33:13.624
ADOPTING ITS CURRENT STANDARDS

00:33:13.691 --> 00:33:15.560
FOR CHILDREN AND ADULTS JEWELRY

00:33:15.626 --> 00:33:18.262
STANDARDS -- SUBSEQUENTLY BASED

00:33:18.329 --> 00:33:20.398
ON STUDIES AND MORE INFORMATION

00:33:20.465 --> 00:33:23.368
THE US CONGRESS CANADA IN THE E.

00:33:23.434 --> 00:33:25.103
U. ADOPTED STANDARDS THAT ARE

00:33:25.169 --> 00:33:27.238
ACTUALLY MANY WAYS STRICTER THAN

00:33:27.305 --> 00:33:28.206
CALIFORNIA STANDARDS.

00:33:28.272 --> 00:33:30.274
SO WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS IT IT

00:33:30.341 --> 00:33:32.643
LOOS AT THOSE STUDIES AND

00:33:32.710 --> 00:33:33.778
INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS OF

00:33:33.845 --> 00:33:35.046
FEDERAL STANDARDS AND

00:33:35.113 --> 00:33:36.714
INCORPORATES MANY OF THOSE

00:33:36.781 --> 00:33:38.649
STANDARDS INTO CALIFORNIA'S LAW

00:33:38.716 --> 00:33:39.584
TO UPDATE IT.

00:33:39.650 --> 00:33:41.352
SO THAT WE ARE HAVING AS MUCH

00:33:41.419 --> 00:33:43.187
PROTECTION HERE AS CHILDREN AND

00:33:43.254 --> 00:33:46.357

00:38:47.992 --> 00:38:49.326
UP FOR DEBATE AND AS THERE'S A

00:38:49.393 --> 00:38:50.728

HEIGHTENED STANDARDS FOR

SUPPORTS THAT.

00:39:11.048 --> 00:39:11.982
IF YOU WANT THE MOST PROTECTIVE

01:03:25.368 --> 01:03:27.036

WE DON'T WANT TO DISCOURAGE

01:03:42.118 --> 01:03:44.687

01:05:17.246 --> 01:05:18.814
THAT MAY BE A PROPERTY RIGHT OR

01:05:18.881 --> 01:05:20.983
WHATEVER THAT THEY'RE THAT

01:05:21.050 --> 01:05:22.385
THEY'RE RELYING ON THAT TO FEEL

01:05:22.451 --> 01:05:24.387
THEIR ADVERSELY AFFECT WHICH IS

01:05:24.453 --> 01:05:26.622
DIFFERENT FROM.

01:05:26.689 --> 01:05:30.126
YOU KNOW AND ACTION OR AS A

01:05:30.192 --> 01:05:31.127
TACTIC THE DAY THE DAY MAY USE

01:05:31.193 --> 01:05:34.697
SO WHAT IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S IT.

01:05:34.764 --> 01:05:35.931
I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THAT BECAUSE

01:05:35.998 --> 01:05:37.933
IT'S USUALLY A CLAIM MEANS IT'S

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:39.735
SOMETHING THAT I YOU KNOW IT'S

01:05:39.802 --> 01:05:41.704
PHYSICAL OR ITS ITS ACTUAL

01:05:41.771 --> 01:05:42.705
AFFECT.

01:05:42.772 --> 01:05:45.308
IN MONETARILY COULD AFFECT ME.

01:05:45.374 --> 01:05:47.677
I GUESS THE NEXT QUESTION I HAVE

01:05:47.743 --> 01:05:50.680
IS THAT CAUSING UNNECESSARY

01:05:50.746 --> 01:05:51.147
DELAYS.

01:05:51.213 --> 01:05:52.014
I GUESS SOME DELAYS ARE

01:05:52.081 --> 01:05:54.617
NECESSARY SUMMER UNNECESSARY BUT

01:05:54.684 --> 01:05:55.985
THIS IS AND REASONABLE DELAY.

01:05:56.052 --> 01:05:56.952
TELL ME YOUR UNDERSTANDING OF

01:05:57.019 --> 01:05:58.654
THAT AT THE CHANGE ROM A

01:05:58.721 --> 01:06:00.022
NECESSARY TO AND REASONABLE I

01:06:00.089 --> 01:06:02.024
THINK WE WANT TO EMPOWER THE

01:06:02.091 --> 01:06:04.593
COURTS ARE IN A SITUATION LIKE

01:06:04.660 --> 01:06:04.794
THIS.

01:06:04.860 --> 01:06:06.929
AND THE JUDGE HERE SHE WILL BE

01:06:06.996 --> 01:06:09.532
IN A POSITION TO DETERMINE ON AT

01:06:09.598 --> 01:06:12.535
BEST WHAT IS A REASONABLE AN

01:06:12.601 --> 01:06:13.969
UNREASONABLE IN FACT THAT'S

01:06:14.036 --> 01:06:16.572
ALREADY CODIFIED -- IN DIFFERENT

01:06:16.639 --> 01:06:18.607
FORMS THROUGH DISCRETION GRANTS

01:06:18.674 --> 01:06:19.942
TO JUDGE IN VIRTUALLY EVERY

01:06:20.009 --> 01:06:21.711
ASPECT OF OUR JUDICIAL SYSTEM SO

01:06:21.777 --> 01:06:23.846
INHERENTLY IT ALREADY EXISTS.

01:06:23.913 --> 01:06:25.548
I THINK WHAT WE WANTED TO DO WAS

01:06:25.614 --> 01:06:27.116
WE WANTED TO TAKE.

01:06:27.183 --> 01:06:29.919
UP AN ALREADY EXISTING -- BODY

01:06:29.985 --> 01:06:31.454
OF LAW.

01:06:31.520 --> 01:06:33.255
IN A RIGHT FOR ATTORNEYS FEES

01:06:33.322 --> 01:06:34.724
THAT ALREADY EXIST AND PUT IT

01:06:34.790 --> 01:06:36.959
ESPECIALLY IN THE CONTEXT.

01:06:37.026 --> 01:06:39.695
OF INFILL HOUSING TO IMPROVE THE

01:06:39.762 --> 01:06:43.499
PROCESS THAT SOMETIMES GETS --

01:06:43.566 --> 01:06:47.970
SLOW DOWN -- ON REASONABLY.

01:06:48.037 --> 01:06:48.704
AND I THINK IF THERE ARE

01:06:48.771 --> 01:06:49.905
MERITORIOUS CLAIMS AS DETERMINED

01:06:49.972 --> 01:06:52.541
BY A JUDGE -- OR THE THE THE

01:06:52.608 --> 01:06:52.775
COURT.

01:06:52.842 --> 01:06:55.244
THOSE ABSOLUTELY ARE GOING TO GO

01:06:55.311 --> 01:06:56.779
THROUGH WE DON'T WANT TO STOP.

01:06:56.846 --> 01:06:59.648
BY -- ACTIONS THAT HAVE -- YOU

01:06:59.715 --> 01:07:01.784
KNOW DEGREES OF MERIT IT'S THE

01:07:01.851 --> 01:07:04.487
ONES THAT HAVE. ZERO MERIT THAT

01:07:04.553 --> 01:07:05.955
ARE DESIGNED ONLY TO EXTRACT

01:07:06.021 --> 01:07:09.625
CONCESSIONS THAT ARE DESIGNED --

01:07:09.692 --> 01:07:11.594
TO TO TO HOBBLE A PROJECT

01:07:11.660 --> 01:07:13.929
WITHOUT LEGAL BASIS.

01:07:13.996 --> 01:07:16.098
WELL THAT WOULD BE ZERO MERRICK

01:07:16.165 --> 01:07:17.833
WITH WITH SEEMS TO ME TO BE

01:07:17.900 --> 01:07:19.602
UNNECESSARY YES THAT WOULD BE

01:07:19.668 --> 01:07:20.770
IT'S IT'S NOT ASSERT

01:07:20.836 --> 01:07:25.040
UNREASONABLE MAY HAVE. 10% MERIT

01:07:25.107 --> 01:07:27.109
128% MERIT SORT OF SEEMS --

01:07:27.176 --> 01:07:28.544
OUTLANDISH FOR SOME PEOPLE OF AN

01:07:28.611 --> 01:07:31.180
INFILL PROPONENT BUT IT'S IT'S A

01:07:31.247 --> 01:07:33.282
IT'S A HIGHER LEVEL AND AND LESS

01:07:33.349 --> 01:07:34.683
I'M MISUNDERSTANDING THE

01:07:34.750 --> 01:07:37.520
UNNECESSARY IN AND REASONABLE

01:07:37.586 --> 01:07:39.054
RIGHT SO THAT TIGHTENS IT UP A

01:07:39.121 --> 01:07:40.956
LITTLE -- I I'D BE WILLING TO

01:07:41.023 --> 01:07:42.925
WORK WITH YOU IF YOU FEEL THAT --

01:07:42.992 --> 01:07:46.295
YOU WOULD PREFER UNNECESSARY --

01:07:46.362 --> 01:07:50.065
INSTEAD OF ON REASONABLE -- I'D

01:07:50.132 --> 01:07:50.900
DEFINITELY BE WILLING TO WORK

01:07:50.966 --> 01:07:52.501
WITH YOU TO TO ADVANCES ALONG

01:07:52.568 --> 01:07:55.438
THE PROCESS I THINK THE THE

01:07:55.504 --> 01:07:58.908
FOLKS SPOKE OUT ARE SAYING THAT --

01:07:58.974 --> 01:08:01.076
YOU KNOW THE PROFESSIONAL --

01:08:01.143 --> 01:08:02.812
ENVIRONMENTALISTS S PROBABLY

01:08:02.878 --> 01:08:04.079
NOT GONNA HAVE ANY PROBLEMS WITH

01:08:04.146 --> 01:08:05.681
THIS BECAUSE THEY'RE GONNA

01:08:05.748 --> 01:08:06.515
THEYRE GONNA BRING A CLAIM AND

01:08:06.582 --> 01:08:08.217
THEIR THEIR LAWYER UP IN THERE

01:08:08.284 --> 01:08:10.152
OKAY IT'S THE UNSOPHISTICATED --

01:08:10.219 --> 01:08:11.787
COMMUNITY GROUP THAT REALLY

01:08:11.854 --> 01:08:14.523
DOESN'T BELIEVE THAT THEY GOT A

01:08:14.590 --> 01:08:16.258
FAIR.

01:08:16.325 --> 01:08:17.693
THERE WAS AN THERE WAS A A

01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:20.196
MEDICATED ARE MITIGATED NEGATIVE

01:08:20.262 --> 01:08:20.830
DECK AND THEY FEEL THAT THEY

01:08:20.896 --> 01:08:21.330
SHOULD HAVE BEEN A WHOLE

01:08:21.397 --> 01:08:23.532
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT AND

01:08:23.599 --> 01:08:24.567
THEY DON'T HAVE.

01:08:24.633 --> 01:08:25.801
YOU KNOW IT'S A SMALL INFILL

01:08:25.868 --> 01:08:27.336
PROJECT AND THEY DON'T FEEL THAT

01:08:27.403 --> 01:08:31.507
THEY'VE THEY GOT THE RIGHT --

01:08:31.574 --> 01:08:32.775
OPPORTUNITY TO VOICE THEIR

01:08:32.842 --> 01:08:34.844
CONCERN BECAUSE OF THE THAT THE

01:08:34.910 --> 01:08:36.278
FAST TRACK THAT THEY HAD MET

01:08:36.345 --> 01:08:38.647
MAYBE GOOD FOR THE PROJECT I I I

01:08:38.714 --> 01:08:39.648
GET THAT SO.

01:08:39.715 --> 01:08:42.051
IT WILL SIT AND SOPHISTICATED

01:08:42.117 --> 01:08:43.953
LOOK -- FOLKS ARE YOU AND I BOTH

01:08:44.019 --> 01:08:45.287
PRACTICE LAW -- AND USE THE

01:08:45.354 --> 01:08:47.356
EXAMPLE OF WHEN I CLERKED FOR

01:08:47.423 --> 01:08:51.594
FOR A JUDGE -- NGUYEN YOU HAD

01:08:51.660 --> 01:08:52.061
FOLKS THAT REPRESENTED

01:08:52.127 --> 01:08:52.728
THEMSELVES.

01:08:52.795 --> 01:08:53.496
IT WAS WITHOUT EXCEPTION THAT

01:08:53.562 --> 01:08:57.166
THE JUDGE WOULD BE GRANTED -- I

01:08:57.233 --> 01:08:58.934
CERTAIN CONSIDERATIONS FOR THE

01:08:59.001 --> 01:09:01.804
UNSOPHISTICATED PETITIONER -- SO

01:09:01.871 --> 01:09:03.572
I THINK ALREADY IN OUR SYSTEM IT

01:09:03.639 --> 01:09:04.874
IS BUILT.

01:09:04.940 --> 01:09:06.509
IN IT'S DESIGNED TO MAKE IT

01:09:06.575 --> 01:09:08.310
ACCESSIBLE.

01:09:08.377 --> 01:09:10.112
AND I THINK IT'S WITHIN YOU KNOW

01:09:10.179 --> 01:09:11.747
THE NORMAL PRACTICE AND AND

01:09:11.814 --> 01:09:13.883
CANONS OF THE JUDICIARY -- FOR

01:09:13.949 --> 01:09:15.484
THOSE -- CONSIDERATIONS TO BE

01:09:15.551 --> 01:09:17.720
MADE NATURALLY SO I THINK IF

01:09:17.786 --> 01:09:20.256
YOUR CONCERN IS -- THAT THE

01:09:20.322 --> 01:09:21.624
LITTLE GUY.

01:09:21.690 --> 01:09:23.559
IS GONNA BE HURT IN THIS PROCESS

01:09:23.626 --> 01:09:24.460
THAT'S NOT THE INTENT AND ONCE

01:09:24.527 --> 01:09:26.929
AGAIN I BIãU MORE THAN WILLING --

01:09:26.996 --> 01:09:29.598
TO WORD SMITH THIS IF THE IF

01:09:29.665 --> 01:09:31.267
YOU'D LIKE TO ENGAGE THIS --

01:09:31.333 --> 01:09:33.402
ENGAGE ON THIS MORE DETAIL --

01:09:33.469 --> 01:09:35.004
I'D LOVE TO EARN YOUR SUPPORT IN

01:09:35.070 --> 01:09:35.771
THIS PROCESSAND BE WILLING TO

01:09:35.838 --> 01:09:36.672
WORK WITH THEM.

01:09:36.739 --> 01:09:38.274
MR ONE LAST QUESTION AND IT'S

01:09:38.340 --> 01:09:40.075
IT'S THE CHILLING EFFECT WELL I

01:09:40.142 --> 01:09:41.277
WOULD AGREE WITH YOU THAT THERE

01:09:41.343 --> 01:09:43.412
ARE -- THERE'S AN INVITATION

01:09:43.479 --> 01:09:44.947
WHEN PEOPLE COME IMPROPER FOR

01:09:45.014 --> 01:09:48.551
THAT THE KIND GENTLER -- JUDGE

01:09:48.617 --> 01:09:50.519
TO ADD WORK WITH THEM AND MAKE

01:09:50.586 --> 01:09:52.555
SURE THAT THEY THEIR HEARD

01:09:52.621 --> 01:09:55.057
THERE'S OTHERS THAT -- HOURS

01:09:55.124 --> 01:09:56.859
DON'T WANT TO SPEND ANY TIME

01:09:56.926 --> 01:09:57.960
WITH THIS NONSENSE -- IS INDEED

01:09:58.027 --> 01:10:02.398
USING THEIR WORDS AND THAT WOULD

01:10:02.464 --> 01:10:04.533
MAKE A FINDING. TO AWARD

01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:05.668
ATTORNEY FEES HE WAS A LITTLE

01:10:05.734 --> 01:10:06.468
SMALL GROUP THAT MAY HAVE A

01:10:06.535 --> 01:10:07.069
CHILLING EFFECT ON OTHER FOLKS

01:10:07.136 --> 01:10:08.637
EVEN THOUGH IT MIGHT NOT HAPPEN

01:10:08.704 --> 01:10:09.572
IN LOS ANGELES BUT THEY KNOW

01:10:09.638 --> 01:10:10.806
THAT THE YEARS HERE'S THIS ONE

01:10:10.873 --> 01:10:13.375
CASE WHERE -- THE JUDGE HAS

01:10:13.442 --> 01:10:14.910
ORDERED ATTORNEY FEES AND THE

01:10:14.977 --> 01:10:17.346
SMALL ACTIVIST GROUPS THAT MAY

01:10:17.413 --> 01:10:17.546
HAVE.

01:10:17.613 --> 01:10:20.182
A LEGITIMATE REASON TO CHALLENGE

01:10:20.249 --> 01:10:21.684
THE PROCESS OF THE LEAD AGENCY

01:10:21.750 --> 01:10:23.452
HIS HAS UNDERTAKEN ON THIS

01:10:23.519 --> 01:10:25.754
INFILL PROJECT WHICH IS WE WANT

01:10:25.821 --> 01:10:26.522
HOUSING AND ALL THAT TYPE STUFF

01:10:26.589 --> 01:10:29.258
SO THOSE ARE THE CONCERNS THAT I

01:10:29.325 --> 01:10:31.193
HAVE.

01:10:31.260 --> 01:10:31.827
NO AND I I WOULD SEE I MEAN THE

01:10:31.894 --> 01:10:32.695
BAD FAITH STANDARD IS A HIGH BAR

01:10:32.761 --> 01:10:34.363
AND THAT'S WHEN THAT I YOU KNOW

01:10:34.430 --> 01:10:35.764
I I CERTAINLY FEEL COMFORTABLE

01:10:35.831 --> 01:10:38.133
WITH -- THE EDISON

01:10:38.200 --> 01:10:40.069
REASONABLENESS STANDARD IS I

01:10:40.135 --> 01:10:42.137
WONDER WHY I YOU KNOW.

01:10:42.204 --> 01:10:43.472
I WANTED I WANT TO GRAB WITH ALL

01:10:43.539 --> 01:10:44.506
OF THE MORE I MEAN WE JUST

01:10:44.573 --> 01:10:45.841
PROVIDED WITH THESE A MAN'S -- I

01:10:45.908 --> 01:10:47.376
AM WELL AWARE OF THE FACT THAT

01:10:47.443 --> 01:10:47.910
THIS WOULD GO TO JUDICIARY

01:10:47.977 --> 01:10:48.611
[inaudible]

01:10:48.677 --> 01:10:51.580
I YOU KNOW I WE'RE ALL IN

01:10:51.647 --> 01:10:53.649
JUDICIARY ALL THREE OF US.

01:10:53.716 --> 01:10:58.988
AND SO I MEAN I I SUPPOSE I I

01:10:59.054 --> 01:11:00.222
WOULD WANT YOU KNOW IF ANYTHING

01:11:00.289 --> 01:11:01.357
OF THAT WOULD BE A GOOD THING

01:11:01.423 --> 01:11:02.257
FOR THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE TO

01:11:02.324 --> 01:11:03.892
LOOK AT AND YOU KNOW AND AND AND

01:11:03.959 --> 01:11:06.161
I THINK FOR US -- TO TO KIND OF

01:11:06.228 --> 01:11:08.263
EXPRESS I'M FULLY COMFORTABLE

01:11:08.330 --> 01:11:09.832
WITH THE BAD FAITH STANDARD I I

01:11:09.898 --> 01:11:11.500
THINK THAT IS HIGHER THAN

01:11:11.567 --> 01:11:12.134
REASONABLE ST I'M I'M AYE AYE

01:11:12.201 --> 01:11:12.935
I'M NOT SAYING I'M NOT

01:11:13.002 --> 01:11:14.770
COMFORTABLE WITH THAT I JUST --

01:11:14.837 --> 01:11:15.604
WOULD WANT.

01:11:15.671 --> 01:11:16.538
TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE

01:11:16.605 --> 01:11:19.608
IMPLICATIONS AND I THINK I I

01:11:19.675 --> 01:11:20.409
WOULD BE LESS COMFORTABLE

01:11:20.476 --> 01:11:21.910
PASSING THIS OUT OF COMMITTEE IF

01:11:21.977 --> 01:11:22.845
IT WERE NOT GOING TO DO THIS

01:11:22.911 --> 01:11:23.278
NEXT.

01:11:23.345 --> 01:11:25.547
I FOR FOR FOR A MORE ROBUST

01:11:25.614 --> 01:11:27.049
EXAMINATION OF WHAT THAT WOULD

01:11:27.116 --> 01:11:29.985
ENTAIL -- BUT I I DO YOU.

01:11:30.052 --> 01:11:31.620
I MEAN I I DO TEND TO BE SOMEONE

01:11:31.687 --> 01:11:32.921
WHO.

01:11:32.988 --> 01:11:34.556
IS PRETTY SUPPORTIVE OF GIVING

01:11:34.623 --> 01:11:35.891
JUDGES DISCRETION I THINK THAT

01:11:35.958 --> 01:11:36.959
IN THE END OF THE DAY YOU KNOW

01:11:37.026 --> 01:11:38.527
ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS YOU'RE

01:11:38.594 --> 01:11:39.294
ABLE TO DETERMINE.

01:11:39.361 --> 01:11:41.230
THIS THE DIFFERENT.

01:11:41.296 --> 01:11:44.366
FACTORS AT PLAY AND AND SO ON I

01:11:44.433 --> 01:11:45.401
I HAVE A LOT OF FAITH IN OUR

01:11:45.467 --> 01:11:47.436
JUDICIARY AND I I FEEL I WAY ON

01:11:47.503 --> 01:11:48.537
ALL THE BILL REFORM ISSUES THAT

01:11:48.604 --> 01:11:50.506
WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT I'M.

EMPLOYER.

02:03:19.558 --> 02:03:20.626
FIRST IT'S IMPORTANT TO KEEP THE

02:03:20.693 --> 02:03:23.028
SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION ON CORE

02:03:23.095 --> 02:03:24.430
PURIFY US. FOR PURIFIES IS AN

TWENTY INSECTICIDE SO IT'S

02:04:00.499 --> 02:04:02.268
NONSPECIFIC. TO THE BEST

02:04:02.334 --> 02:04:04.003
SCIENTIFIC PRACTICE TO COMPARE

02:04:04.069 --> 02:04:07.006
RESULTS SPECIFIC TO CHLORPYRIFOS

02:04:07.072 --> 02:04:09.575
AND LOOKING AT RESULTS FOR TCP

02:04:09.642 --> 02:04:11.243
IN D. E. P..

02:04:11.310 --> 02:04:12.645
NOT THE LESS SPECIFIC ON ALL OUR

02:04:12.711 --> 02:04:15.748
GAL PHOSPHATES IMPORTANT TO

02:04:15.815 --> 02:04:17.383
COMPARE LIKE WITH LIKE.

02:04:17.449 --> 02:04:19.919
SECONDLY IN A POINT OF AGREEMENT

02:04:19.985 --> 02:04:21.987
IN THE PAST TWENTY YEARS THE DPR

02:04:22.054 --> 02:04:23.956
REGULATION OF CORPORATE BOSS HAS

02:04:24.023 --> 02:04:25.257
CHANGED USES.

02:04:25.324 --> 02:04:27.626
REDUCE DRAFT AND AS A RESULT THE

02:04:27.693 --> 02:04:29.528
EXPOSURE POTENTIAL HAS DECLINED

02:04:29.595 --> 02:04:31.630
IN CALIFORNIA.

02:04:31.697 --> 02:04:33.332
SPEAKING TO THE EPIDEMIOLOGY

02:04:33.399 --> 02:04:34.633
STUDIES FOR THE MOST PART THE

02:04:34.700 --> 02:04:36.402
STUDIES ON CHILDREN WERE BORN IN

02:04:36.468 --> 02:04:38.404
THE LATE NINETEEN NINETIES IN

02:04:38.470 --> 02:04:40.673
THE FIRST DECADE OF TWO THOUSAND

02:04:40.739 --> 02:04:41.540
THE NEW YORK CITY STUDIES FROM

02:04:41.607 --> 02:04:44.043
COLUMBIA AND MOUNT SINAI ARE

02:04:44.109 --> 02:04:46.111
ABOUT INDOOR APPLICATIONS WHICH

02:04:46.178 --> 02:04:48.314
ARE NO LONGER REGISTERED.

02:04:48.380 --> 02:04:50.482
THERE ARE TWO AUTISM STUDIES YOU

02:04:50.549 --> 02:04:51.116
HEAR ABOUT.

02:04:51.183 --> 02:04:53.085
A LOT AND BOTH RELIED ON

02:04:53.152 --> 02:04:54.353
APPLICATION AND RESIDENTS

02:04:54.420 --> 02:04:56.455
RECORDS FROM THE NINETEEN

02:04:56.522 --> 02:04:58.457
NINETIES.

02:04:58.524 --> 02:04:59.425
TO TWO THOUSAND TEN REASSURINGLY

02:04:59.491 --> 02:05:01.493
THE AUTISM STUDY OF CHILDREN AS

02:05:01.560 --> 02:05:03.295
REPORTED BY UC DAVIS MOST

02:05:03.362 --> 02:05:04.163
RECENTLY.

02:05:04.230 --> 02:05:06.632
FOUND NO LINK OF CHLORPYRIFOS AN

02:05:06.699 --> 02:05:09.101
AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER.

02:05:09.168 --> 02:05:11.737
IN OTHER WORDS DPR HAS ADDRESSED

02:05:11.804 --> 02:05:13.939
THE CONCERNS OF THIS PANEL.

02:05:14.006 --> 02:05:16.175
FURTHER THE HOME STUDY IN OHIO

02:05:16.242 --> 02:05:18.510
CAN DISPEL SOME CONCERNS ABOUT

02:05:18.577 --> 02:05:20.646
RESIDUE ON FOOD SINCE NO ADVERSE

02:05:20.713 --> 02:05:22.514
ASSOCIATIONS WERE REPORTED WITH

02:05:22.581 --> 02:05:23.649
CHLORPYRIFOS LEVELS IN THIS

02:05:23.716 --> 02:05:25.351
STUDY.

02:05:25.417 --> 02:05:26.518
THE MESSAGE SO I'D LIKE YOU TO

02:05:26.585 --> 02:05:28.587
KEEP IN MIND IS THAT MODERN USE

02:05:28.654 --> 02:05:30.022
PRACTICES IN DVRS ADDITIONAL

02:05:30.089 --> 02:05:32.157
PROTECTION FOR CALIFORNIA USES.

02:05:32.224 --> 02:05:34.493
SHOULD BE EVALUATED BEFORE

02:05:34.560 --> 02:05:36.562
IMPLEMENTATION OF A BAND.

02:05:36.629 --> 02:05:38.197
IN CLOSING THE CONTEXT OF WHAT

02:05:38.264 --> 02:05:39.531
WE KNOW ABOUT THE SCIENCE

02:05:39.598 --> 02:05:40.733
LOOKING AT BEST SCIENTIFIC

02:05:40.799 --> 02:05:42.701
METHODS EXPOSURE LEVEL AND

02:05:42.768 --> 02:05:44.703
REPLICATION.

02:05:44.770 --> 02:05:46.238
THE COLLECTIVE EPIDEMIOLOGY DATA

02:05:46.305 --> 02:05:48.440
DO NOT SUPPORT CAUSE AND EFFECT

02:05:48.507 --> 02:05:49.608
RELATIONSHIP FOR RURAL

IN CORPUS EXPOSURE.

02:05:52.711 --> 02:05:53.479
I'D LIKE TO SET THE RECORD

02:05:53.545 --> 02:05:55.814
STRAIGHT ABOUT THE POINT ABOUT

02:05:55.881 --> 02:05:57.650
RESIDUES BEING A HUNDRED AND

02:05:57.716 --> 02:05:58.717
FORTY TIMES HIGHER THAN USEPA

02:05:58.784 --> 02:06:00.719
SAFE LEVELS.

02:06:00.786 --> 02:06:02.721
THIS WAS BASED ON A DRAFT POINT

02:06:02.788 --> 02:06:04.123
OF DEPARTURE.

02:06:04.189 --> 02:06:05.891
ON WHICH WAS BASED AND THAT IT

02:06:05.958 --> 02:06:08.160
WAS DEBATED AND REJECTED AS POOR

02:06:08.227 --> 02:06:09.895

BANDS LIKE THE ONE PROPOSED MAY

02:06:23.342 --> 02:06:25.711
HAVE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF

02:06:25.778 --> 02:06:27.613
INCREASED RESISTANCE.

02:06:27.680 --> 02:06:29.815
DUE TO LIMITED TOOLS HIGHER USE

02:06:29.882 --> 02:06:32.351
OF LEFT LESS EFFECTIVE PRODUCTS

IN MY JOB IS.

02:06:53.806 --> 02:06:55.474
TO GROW THE BEST CROSS THAT WE

CAN'T SO I SPECIALIZE IN GROWING

02:06:57.609 --> 02:06:59.345
TREE CROPS LIKE CITRUS AND NUTS

02:06:59.411 --> 02:07:00.879
AND VINES AND THINGS LIKE THAT

02:07:00.946 --> 02:07:02.548
AND I'VE BEEN DOING THIS A LONG

02:07:02.614 --> 02:07:03.983
TIME I WAS.

02:07:04.049 --> 02:07:06.785
BORN IN A FARMING FAMILY AND BUT

02:07:06.852 --> 02:07:09.455
I STARTED THIS BUSINESS ONE

02:07:09.521 --> 02:07:11.223
BECAUSE I LIKE FARMING INTO --

02:07:11.290 --> 02:07:13.492
YOU KNOW WE'RE GROWN REALLY GOOD

02:07:13.559 --> 02:07:14.293
CROPS MEAN STUFF THAT WE ALL EAT

02:07:14.360 --> 02:07:15.728
EVERY DAY EVERYBODY'S IN ALMOST

02:07:15.794 --> 02:07:16.495
NOW.

02:07:16.562 --> 02:07:18.630
CUTIES HALOS MANDARINS.

02:07:18.697 --> 02:07:20.632
THESE THINGS ARE VERY POPULAR

02:07:20.699 --> 02:07:22.668
THINGS AND AS PART OF OUR

02:07:22.735 --> 02:07:24.603
INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT

02:07:24.670 --> 02:07:26.538
SYSTEMS WE HAVE JUST A SMALL

02:07:26.605 --> 02:07:27.940
AMOUNT OF TOOLBOX LAUGHTER

02:07:28.007 --> 02:07:29.708
THINGS THAT WE CAN USE.

02:07:29.775 --> 02:07:31.744
SO IN MY PARTICULAR CASE I TRY

02:07:31.810 --> 02:07:35.381
TO UTILIZE AS MUCH BIOLOGICAL.

02:07:35.447 --> 02:07:37.783
A INSECTS TO HELP US GET OUR JOB

02:07:37.850 --> 02:07:40.252
DONE BUT FROM TIME TO TIME WE

02:07:40.319 --> 02:07:41.587
HAVE TO DO THINGS LIKE SPRAYED

02:07:41.653 --> 02:07:41.787
WITH.

02:07:41.854 --> 02:07:42.955
PESTICIDES AND SO I WANT TO RUN

02:07:43.022 --> 02:07:44.189
DOWN REAL QUICK.

02:07:44.256 --> 02:07:47.159

THOSE STUDIES ABSOLUTELY BUT

02:14:31.797 --> 02:14:33.965
CERTAINLY THE USE PATTERNS WERE

02:14:34.032 --> 02:14:35.100

I'M NOT PARTICULAR INTEREST WITH

02:15:18.176 --> 02:15:19.778

SAY ABOUT [inaudible]

02:15:21.379 --> 02:15:23.482
THIS.

02:15:23.548 --> 02:15:26.485
CHEMICALS BILL -- I KNOW WITH

02:15:26.551 --> 02:15:27.686
THEIR THEIR MOTIVES ARE GOING TO

02:15:27.752 --> 02:15:29.921
BE THERE -- SELLING PRODUCT I

02:15:29.988 --> 02:15:31.656
THINK ON THE WHOLE.

02:15:31.723 --> 02:15:34.493
BUT I DO WANT TO BRING BACK UP.

THAT SORT OF THINK THAT FEAR

02:16:05.557 --> 02:16:07.626
CLOUD THIS LEGISLATION LET'S

02:16:07.692 --> 02:16:08.393
LET'S GET DOWN TO IT LET'S

02:16:08.460 --> 02:16:09.628
FIGURE OUT.

02:16:09.694 --> 02:16:10.829
IS THIS ACTUALLY USEFUL OR NOT

02:16:10.896 --> 02:16:12.364
SO IS THERE ANYONE STILL HERE

02:16:12.430 --> 02:16:14.866
FROM THE CITRUS INDUSTRY JUST

02:16:14.933 --> 02:16:16.635
GIVES A GENERAL SENSE.

02:16:16.701 --> 02:16:19.137

TO JUST OVER NINE HUNDRED

02:16:29.848 --> 02:16:31.483
THOUSAND POUNDS IN TWENTY

02:16:31.550 --> 02:16:34.586
SIXTEEN AND THEN IT SAYS THE THE

02:16:34.653 --> 02:16:39.558
THE INTERIM RAGS FROM T. P. R.

02:16:39.624 --> 02:16:39.858
[inaudible]

02:16:39.925 --> 02:16:40.425
RECOMMENDED.

02:16:40.492 --> 02:16:43.295
DISCONTINUING ITS USE ON MOST

02:16:43.361 --> 02:16:44.362
CROPS SO SOON WALK US THROUGH A

02:16:44.429 --> 02:16:46.731
LITTLE BIT LIKE.

02:16:46.798 --> 02:16:49.301
WHAT CROPS ARE STILL ALLOWED BY

02:16:49.367 --> 02:16:51.303
THOSE INTERIM RIGS WHAT WHAT IS

02:16:51.369 --> 02:16:52.470
THAT LIMITED TREATMENT LOOK LIKE

02:16:52.537 --> 02:16:53.705
AND YOU SAID YOU TALKED ABOUT

02:16:53.772 --> 02:16:53.905
LIKE?

02:16:53.972 --> 02:16:56.541
OTHER PASSED AT OTHER USE OF A I

02:16:56.608 --> 02:16:58.577
FORGET WHAT YOU CALL -- THE

02:16:58.643 --> 02:17:00.045
OTHER IN SYNC INSECTS BEEN

02:17:00.111 --> 02:17:04.649
BENEFICIAL -- YES -- SO FOR A

02:17:04.716 --> 02:17:06.351
LONG TIME A LARGE VAN WAS USED

02:17:06.418 --> 02:17:08.119
FOR CALIFORNIA RED SCALE WHICH

02:17:08.186 --> 02:17:10.288
IS BEEN A PROBLEM FOR A LONG

02:17:10.355 --> 02:17:12.057
TIME IT'S AN INSECT THAT.

02:17:12.123 --> 02:17:13.158
LANDS ON YOUR FRUIT IT'S THOSE

02:17:13.224 --> 02:17:15.293
LITTLE ROUND SPECS THAT ARE ALL

02:17:15.360 --> 02:17:16.628
OVER YOUR FRUIT.

02:17:16.695 --> 02:17:18.363
AND YOU KNOW AS OUR CLIENTS GET

02:17:18.430 --> 02:17:19.931
WARMER AND ALL THAT IT'S BECOME

02:17:19.998 --> 02:17:21.967
WORSE AND WORSE SO ANYWAYS THAT

02:17:22.033 --> 02:17:23.535
PRODUCT IS NO LONGER USE FOR

02:17:23.602 --> 02:17:24.202
THAT.

02:17:24.269 --> 02:17:26.338
SO THAT WOULD HAVE BESIDES THAT

02:17:26.404 --> 02:17:27.339
USING EVERY DAY THOUGH IT WE CAN

02:17:27.405 --> 02:17:29.207
EITHER USE IN COURT YOUR FAUCET

02:17:29.274 --> 02:17:30.775
OUR WE'RE NOT NO NAY PACK I HAVE

02:17:30.842 --> 02:17:33.845
AND USE IT IN OVER THREE YEARS.

02:17:33.912 --> 02:17:34.713
BECAUSE IT'S SO HARD TO USE BUT

02:17:34.779 --> 02:17:35.347
I CAN STILL USE AND THAT'S THE

02:17:35.413 --> 02:17:36.848
POINT IS THAT.

02:17:36.915 --> 02:17:38.416
IT WITH A C. P. IS A HUGE

02:17:38.483 --> 02:17:40.352
PROBLEM ESPECIALLY WHEN HLB

02:17:40.418 --> 02:17:41.620
SHOWS UP LIKE YOU SAID TWO

02:17:41.686 --> 02:17:43.421
THIRDS OF FLORIDA INDUSTRIES

02:17:43.488 --> 02:17:45.523
WIPED OUT AS A RESULT OF THIS.

02:17:45.590 --> 02:17:47.559
WINTER IS THE HEIGHT OF IT SO

02:17:47.626 --> 02:17:49.561
THIS IS A CHEMICAL THAT WE CAN

02:17:49.628 --> 02:17:51.429
USE TO WIN DO YOU WANT TO USE IT

02:17:51.496 --> 02:17:52.030
THAT THAT'S WHAT I'M CURIOUS

02:17:52.097 --> 02:17:53.298
THANK YOU SEE IMEAN USED FOR

02:17:53.365 --> 02:17:53.798
THREE YEARS.

02:17:53.865 --> 02:17:55.166
MY ONLY USE ONLY I NEED TO USE

02:17:55.233 --> 02:17:57.569
IT WHEN IT'S A BECOMES A PROBLEM.

02:17:57.636 --> 02:17:58.903
I DON'T WANT MY VARIOUS VERSUS

02:17:58.970 --> 02:18:00.171
SOME OTHER CHEMICAL WHEN THEY

02:18:00.238 --> 02:18:00.872
BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE VERY MANY

02:18:00.939 --> 02:18:02.807
OPTIONS WELL WHAT ARE THE OTHER

02:18:02.874 --> 02:18:04.909
OPTIONS BESIDES THE THE IN THE

02:18:04.976 --> 02:18:05.910

OUT WHAT OTHER CHEMICAL

02:20:33.792 --> 02:20:35.727
APPLICATIONS OUT THERE IS THE

02:20:35.794 --> 02:20:37.462
CITRUS INDUSTRY USING BESIDES

02:20:37.529 --> 02:20:42.300
CORP HERE FOSS TO PREVENT HLB.

02:20:42.367 --> 02:20:43.601
FOUR IT'S NOT PREVENTING HLB

02:20:43.668 --> 02:20:46.771
IT'S IT'S THIS ORDER ATTACK IT

02:20:46.838 --> 02:20:46.938
IS.

02:20:47.005 --> 02:20:49.407
TO INSECTS FINE THE TICKET KELLY

02:20:49.474 --> 02:20:50.275
C. P..

02:20:50.341 --> 02:20:51.075
THE KILL SELLERS WHAT ELSE WITH

02:20:51.142 --> 02:20:55.413
WHAT OTHER CHEMICALS ARE OUT

02:20:55.480 --> 02:20:56.047
THERE THAT THE INDUSTRIES USING

02:20:56.114 --> 02:20:56.948
RIGHT NOW.

02:20:57.015 --> 02:20:58.483
ALL OF A THREE OR FOUR OTHER

02:20:58.550 --> 02:20:59.117
CHEMICALS THAT WE CAN HEAR LIKE

02:20:59.184 --> 02:21:00.919
WHAT.

02:21:00.985 --> 02:21:01.519
I KNOW I HAVEN'T HAD TO SPRAY

02:21:01.586 --> 02:21:01.786
FOR YET.

02:21:01.853 --> 02:21:02.987
AS ANY DID ANYONE IN HERE HAVE

02:21:03.054 --> 02:21:05.290
ANYMORE INFORMATION THERE YEAH

02:21:05.356 --> 02:21:08.459
LAURENCE SORRY I I THAT I JUST.

02:21:08.526 --> 02:21:09.460
YEAH I JUST WANT TO GET TO THE

02:21:09.527 --> 02:21:10.728
NITTY GRITTY THANK YOU SENATORS

02:21:10.795 --> 02:21:11.763
SO -- THE CHERRIES CORRECT

02:21:11.830 --> 02:21:12.864
NEONICOTINOIDS ARE THE OTHER

02:21:12.931 --> 02:21:14.432
ALTERNATIVE AND THAT'S WHAT'S

02:21:14.499 --> 02:21:16.267
MOST USED WHEN IT'S COME TO

02:21:16.334 --> 02:21:18.469
COMBATING ACP AGENTS THAT ARE

02:21:18.536 --> 02:21:19.704
STILL IN TRYING TO KEEP IT OUT

02:21:19.771 --> 02:21:20.705
OF COMMERCIAL GROVES.

02:21:20.772 --> 02:21:22.040
THAT'S IS BEING USED IN SOUTHERN

02:21:22.106 --> 02:21:23.575
CALIFORNIA TO FIGHT IN THE

02:21:23.641 --> 02:21:25.076
BACKYARDS SO THAT IS THE

02:21:25.143 --> 02:21:26.444
ALTERNATIVE RIGHT NOW THERE'S

02:21:26.511 --> 02:21:28.646
ALSO -- WE'RE TRYING WITH THE

02:21:28.713 --> 02:21:30.782
WASPS BUT UNFORTUNATELY TAMARIX

02:21:30.849 --> 02:21:32.383
CO AS FAST AS THEIR BREEDING

02:21:32.450 --> 02:21:33.418
THEY JUST CAN'T KEEP UP.

02:21:33.484 --> 02:21:34.919
SO THOSE ARE THE ALTERNATIVES

02:21:34.986 --> 02:21:36.621
WERE LOOKING FOR WE'RE LOOKING

02:21:36.688 --> 02:21:38.122
FOR TERRORISTS YET.

02:21:38.189 --> 02:21:39.591
ARE GIVE ME THAT ONE AGAIN SO IT

02:21:39.657 --> 02:21:41.226
WAS TAMARIX YOU IT'S A LITTLE

02:21:41.292 --> 02:21:42.560
LAS HOW THAT'S THE BIOLOGICAL

02:21:42.627 --> 02:21:44.562
CONTROL YES AND IF YOU KNOW WE

02:21:44.629 --> 02:21:46.631
WOULD LOVE IT IF WE COULD JUST.

02:21:46.698 --> 02:21:49.634
USE THESE WASPS EAT UP THE BUG

02:21:49.701 --> 02:21:52.570
AND BE DONE WITH IT BUT THEY

02:21:52.637 --> 02:21:53.605
JUST CAN'T.

02:21:53.671 --> 02:21:54.606
THE BASS NUMBER LOGICAL NOT

02:21:54.672 --> 02:21:55.506
ENOUGH THE NEAR NEXT WHICH I

02:21:55.573 --> 02:21:57.041
KNOW THERE'S OTHER CONCERNS

02:21:57.108 --> 02:21:57.709
ABOUT IN THE POLLINATOR

02:21:57.775 --> 02:21:59.811
POPULATION FOR THOSE WE'VE HAD

02:21:59.878 --> 02:22:00.812
SOME OF THOSE BILLS THAT PASS

02:22:00.879 --> 02:22:01.613
BUT SO IN.

02:22:01.679 --> 02:22:02.847
THOSE THE ONLY.

02:22:02.914 --> 02:22:04.582
TWO THOSE ARE REALLY THE ONLY

02:22:04.649 --> 02:22:06.684
TWO THAT ARE EFFECTIVE BESIDES

02:22:06.751 --> 02:22:08.553
CORPORATE VICE THEIR **** WE'RE

02:22:08.620 --> 02:22:09.621
LOOKING FOR OTHER ALTERNATIVES

02:22:09.687 --> 02:22:10.655
THERE'S SOME RESEARCH BEING DONE

02:22:10.722 --> 02:22:12.323
AT UC RIVERSIDE RIGHT NOW TRYING

02:22:12.390 --> 02:22:14.259
TO FIND SOME THINGS TO DO. ONE

02:22:14.325 --> 02:22:15.994
OF THE ISSUES THAT WE HAVE WHICH

02:22:16.060 --> 02:22:18.196
IS IT'S KIND OF ONE OF THOSE

02:22:18.263 --> 02:22:18.997
POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE IN

02:22:19.063 --> 02:22:20.365
CALIFORNIA WERE THE ONLY STATE

02:22:20.431 --> 02:22:21.766
THAT HAS A DEPARTMENT OF

02:22:21.833 --> 02:22:23.134
PESTICIDE REGULATION.

02:22:23.201 --> 02:22:25.236
GOOD FOR CALIFORNIA BECAUSE THAT

02:22:25.303 --> 02:22:26.271
MEANS NO MATTER WHAT THE FEDERAL

02:22:26.337 --> 02:22:27.972
GOVERNMENT DOES CALIFORNIA MAKE

02:22:28.039 --> 02:22:28.973
SURE IT'S SAFE BEFORE IT GETS

02:22:29.040 --> 02:22:30.508
HERE BUT WHAT THAT DOES DO IS IT

02:22:30.575 --> 02:22:32.977
EXTENDS THE TIME AND THE COST

02:22:33.044 --> 02:22:34.746
FOR OTHER ALTERNATIVES TO MAKE

02:22:34.812 --> 02:22:36.547
ITS WAY INTO CALIFORNIA'S MARKET

02:22:36.614 --> 02:22:37.181
PLACE.

02:22:37.248 --> 02:22:39.417
AND IT COST MILLIONS OF DOLLARS

02:22:39.484 --> 02:22:41.486
TO GET THESE THINGS THROUGH THE

02:22:41.552 --> 02:22:42.921
SCIENTIFIC PROCESS.

02:22:42.987 --> 02:22:44.989
I'M TO MAKE IT TO THE MARKET AND

02:22:45.056 --> 02:22:46.324
IT CAN BE TEN TO FIFTEEN YEARS

02:22:46.391 --> 02:22:47.558
THROUGH THE FEDERAL PROCESS AND

02:22:47.625 --> 02:22:49.494
WITH THE PR SO THAT'S ONE OF THE

02:22:49.560 --> 02:22:50.895
REASONS THAT WE'RE WE'RE TRYING

02:22:50.962 --> 02:22:51.396
TO GET MORE OF THESE

02:22:51.462 --> 02:22:52.697
ALTERNATIVES.

02:22:52.764 --> 02:22:54.132
BUT IT TAKES SUCH A LONG TIME

02:22:54.198 --> 02:22:57.335
WHAT LONG AMOUNT OF TIME AND

02:22:57.402 --> 02:22:58.670
IT'S SUCH A LARGE INVESTMENT.

02:22:58.736 --> 02:23:00.038
WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT SOME WAY

02:23:00.104 --> 02:23:02.707
TO STILL PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH

02:23:02.774 --> 02:23:03.841
PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT.

02:23:03.908 --> 02:23:07.378
AND ALSO GET THESE ALTERNATIVES

02:23:07.445 --> 02:23:09.347
IN HERE BUT WE DON'T HAVE A

02:23:09.414 --> 02:23:10.748
SOLUTION FOR THAT YET BECAUSE WE

02:23:10.815 --> 02:23:12.517
NEED WE STILL NEED. TO BE MAKING

02:23:12.583 --> 02:23:14.319
SURE THAT ALL THE SCIENCES

02:23:14.385 --> 02:23:16.154
CORRECT IN BEING DONE BEFORE IT

02:23:16.220 --> 02:23:18.356
EVER GETS RELEASED INTO THE

02:23:18.423 --> 02:23:20.658
MARKET BUT THAT'S THAT'S WHY

02:23:20.725 --> 02:23:22.994
IT'S IT'S HARD AND SO WHILE.

02:23:23.061 --> 02:23:24.796
FARMERS AT THE TIME I'M SORRY TO

02:23:24.862 --> 02:23:25.596
INTERRUPT YOU BUT WHEN YOU'RE

02:23:25.663 --> 02:23:26.898
SAYING TOO LONG OF A LAG TIME

02:23:26.965 --> 02:23:28.399
BUT I MEAN I KNOW EVERYONE'S

02:23:28.466 --> 02:23:30.768
HUSTLING FROM WHAT I CAN TELL

02:23:30.835 --> 02:23:32.236
THEIR DITCHES INDUSTRY. TO TRY

02:23:32.303 --> 02:23:32.837
TO GET SOMETHING SOME OTHER

02:23:32.904 --> 02:23:33.705
SOLUTIONS TO MARKET LIKE I I

02:23:33.771 --> 02:23:34.872
DON'T HEAR YOU GUYS SAYING YOU

02:23:34.939 --> 02:23:36.407
WANT TO USE THIS HE SAID HE

02:23:36.474 --> 02:23:37.542
DOESN'T EVEN USE IT NOW IT'S

02:23:37.608 --> 02:23:39.110
IT'S ONE OF THOSE PESTICIDES IS

02:23:39.177 --> 02:23:40.545
KIND OF A LAST RESORT PESTICIDE

02:23:40.611 --> 02:23:40.979
YOU USE IT.

02:23:41.045 --> 02:23:42.714
WHEN YOU HAVE THESE GIANT

02:23:42.780 --> 02:23:44.415
INFESTATIONS AND NOTHING ELSE IS

02:23:44.482 --> 02:23:45.817
WORKING?

02:23:45.883 --> 02:23:48.553
I'M AND THAT'S WHY WE ARGUE THAT

02:23:48.619 --> 02:23:49.187
IT JUST NEEDS TO BE A TOOL IN

02:23:49.253 --> 02:23:51.622
THE TOOLBOX THAT'S USED IN.

02:23:51.689 --> 02:23:53.291
LIMITED USES IS RESTRICTED AND

02:23:53.358 --> 02:23:54.225
THINGS LIKE THAT WERE TRYING TO

02:23:54.292 --> 02:23:56.027
GET ALTERNATIVES BUT IT YOU HAVE

02:23:56.094 --> 02:23:57.161
TO GO THROUGH THE SCIENTIFIC

02:23:57.228 --> 02:23:59.030
PROCESS WE NEED TO MAKE SURE.

02:23:59.097 --> 02:24:00.398
THE SCIENCE IS THERE AND THE

02:24:00.465 --> 02:24:01.566
MITIGATION MEASURES ARE THERE IN

02:24:01.632 --> 02:24:02.934
THE RESTRICTIONS ARE THERE

02:24:03.001 --> 02:24:04.569
BEFORE IT EVER GETS USED AND NOT

02:24:04.635 --> 02:24:05.937
JUST TAKES TIME.

02:24:06.004 --> 02:24:08.539
AND A LOT OF MONEY I JUST I WERE

02:24:08.606 --> 02:24:10.274
IN A RUSH BOTH ON A C. P. BUT

02:24:10.341 --> 02:24:11.809
ALSO ON HUMAN HEALTH HERE AND SO

02:24:11.876 --> 02:24:15.813
I I DON'T AT EIGHT IT'S TOO OPEN

02:24:15.880 --> 02:24:17.148
ENDED RIGHT NOW AND JUST THAT IT

02:24:17.215 --> 02:24:18.916
WAS A DRAFT REGULATION.

02:24:18.983 --> 02:24:20.685
I DON'T KNOW I I DON'T FIND THAT

02:24:20.752 --> 02:24:21.386
PARTICULARLY COMPELLING LIKE

02:24:21.452 --> 02:24:23.221
THIS IT THIS LAST ADMINISTRATION

02:24:23.287 --> 02:24:24.389
I TRUSTS.

02:24:24.455 --> 02:24:26.257
FUNDAMENTALLY THE NEW ONE I

02:24:26.324 --> 02:24:28.493
DON'T FUNDAMENTALLY SO LIKE IF

02:24:28.559 --> 02:24:30.228
IT'S A MATTER OF ME THERE'S A

02:24:30.294 --> 02:24:31.729
LOT OF RAIDS THAT.

02:24:31.796 --> 02:24:33.631
WE WERE SUPPOSED TO HAVE THAT

02:24:33.698 --> 02:24:36.167
THAT JUST DIDN'T MATERIALIZE --

02:24:36.234 --> 02:24:37.702
I DON'T NEED IT TO BE EVEN CLEAR

02:24:37.769 --> 02:24:39.604
AND CONVINCING AT THIS POINT I

02:24:39.670 --> 02:24:41.239
HAVE A VERY PRECAUTIONARY.

02:24:41.305 --> 02:24:42.707
SENSE ON THE THE HUMAN HEALTH

02:24:42.774 --> 02:24:43.941
SIDE I JUST.

02:24:44.008 --> 02:24:46.044
I DON'T WANT.

02:24:46.110 --> 02:24:47.578
TO WE CAN'T BREAK YOU GUYS AND

02:24:47.645 --> 02:24:49.580
AND WE CAN HAVE AN OUTBREAK HERE

02:24:49.647 --> 02:24:51.549
SO HOW DO WE FIND A WAY TO

02:24:51.616 --> 02:24:53.184
BRIDGE THIS PERIOD WERE

02:24:53.251 --> 02:24:54.819
BASICALLY PHASING THIS THING OUT.

02:24:54.886 --> 02:24:56.154
AND I I DON'T HEAR IT COMING

02:24:56.220 --> 02:24:57.622
FROM INDUSTRY DAY BUT LIKE IT'S

02:24:57.688 --> 02:24:59.757
AT THE END IS NEAR AS A MATTER

02:24:59.824 --> 02:25:00.725
OF WHEN FEELS LIKE.

02:25:00.792 --> 02:25:03.061
AND WOOD WE DO TODAY OR DO WE DO-IT.

02:25:03.127 --> 02:25:04.362
WHENEVER THIS NEW STUFF COMES TO

02:25:04.429 --> 02:25:05.596
MARKET SO.

02:25:05.663 --> 02:25:08.399
I I I DON'T KNOW WHEN THAT

02:25:08.466 --> 02:25:10.368
INDIA'S BUT HOW DO WE MAKE THAT

02:25:10.435 --> 02:25:11.869
TRANSITION WORKS OVER IF WE MOVE

02:25:11.936 --> 02:25:13.171
THIS THING THROUGH.

02:25:13.237 --> 02:25:15.540
RIGHT LIKE HOW HOW DO WE FIND

02:25:15.606 --> 02:25:18.476
THAT BRIDGE TO SOLVE THE THE A.

02:25:18.543 --> 02:25:20.578
C. P. ISSUE IN THE NEAR TERM DO

02:25:20.645 --> 02:25:21.245
YOU THIS I MEAN YOU GUYS HAVE A

02:25:21.312 --> 02:25:21.979
GUIDE.

02:25:22.046 --> 02:25:23.047
READ ON THAT I KNOW YOU'RE

02:25:23.114 --> 02:25:25.883
INCREDULOUS ABOUT THE THIS SORT

02:25:25.950 --> 02:25:28.219
OF ALTERNATIVES BEING.

02:25:28.286 --> 02:25:29.954
I ON WORKABLE THE GOOD THE THE

02:25:30.021 --> 02:25:38.796
THINK THERE'S FUNDAMENTAL MERIT

02:25:38.863 --> 02:25:39.097
[inaudible]

02:25:39.163 --> 02:25:41.232
WITHOUT CHLORPYRIFOS.

02:25:41.299 --> 02:25:50.508
YES BECAUSE THE SO JUST FOR THE

02:25:50.575 --> 02:25:51.642
FIRM FROM YOUR PROTECTED SENATOR

02:25:51.709 --> 02:25:53.277
THEIR PROPONENTS I MEAN JUST.

02:25:53.344 --> 02:25:54.078
WHAT IS THIS TRANSITION LOOK

02:25:54.145 --> 02:25:54.979
LIKE?

02:25:55.046 --> 02:25:56.747
WE BàN IT WE ENDED.

02:25:56.814 --> 02:25:57.949
AND THEN SO HOW DO WE SOLVE THIS

02:25:58.015 --> 02:25:59.617
SOARED IN TERM PERIOD BECAUSE I

02:25:59.684 --> 02:26:01.486
WANT I WANT TO I'M THERE I JUST.

02:26:01.552 --> 02:26:02.887
CENTER I THINK YOUR YOUR

02:26:02.954 --> 02:26:04.055
INSTINCT IS CORRECT I MEAN THIS

02:26:04.122 --> 02:26:05.656
STUFF IT'S BEEN PROVEN TO BE

02:26:05.723 --> 02:26:06.624
DANGEROUS FOR CHILDREN IN A

02:26:06.691 --> 02:26:08.326
NEEDS TO COME OFF THE MARKET.

02:26:08.392 --> 02:26:11.162
BUT I WHAT I'M HEARING FROM THE

02:26:11.229 --> 02:26:12.930
POSITION IS THAT THEY DON'T USE

02:26:12.997 --> 02:26:14.565
QUICKER OF US NOW.

02:26:14.632 --> 02:26:15.500
THERE ARE TWO ALTERNATIVES AND

02:26:15.566 --> 02:26:16.701
MORE ON THE WET HE DOESN'T USING

02:26:16.767 --> 02:26:17.835
NOW BECAUSE HE DOES HAVE AN

02:26:17.902 --> 02:26:19.370
INFESTATION OF LONG BEING SO HE

02:26:19.437 --> 02:26:20.438
DOES NEED TO GO KILL THOSE SOLD

02:26:20.505 --> 02:26:21.372
BECAUSE THERE'S NO INFESTATION

02:26:21.439 --> 02:26:24.175
BUT HE'S ALSO SAYING IF THERE IS.

02:26:24.242 --> 02:26:29.113
ONE WE NEED TO HIT HARD SO LIKE

02:26:29.180 --> 02:26:29.747
IF IF SOMETHING BREAKS OUT WHAT

02:26:29.814 --> 02:26:30.681
WE DO.

02:26:30.748 --> 02:26:31.549
YOU KNOW SENATOR I I THINK THAT

02:26:31.616 --> 02:26:33.384
THAT'S A QUESTION WILL HAVE TO

02:26:33.451 --> 02:26:34.452
GET BACK TO YOU ON THIS.

02:26:34.519 --> 02:26:35.052
VERY CLEAR ON WHAT THIS MEANS

02:26:35.119 --> 02:26:37.155
FOR CHILDREN'S HEALTH.

02:26:37.221 --> 02:26:38.589
I WOULD ALSO ADD.

02:26:38.656 --> 02:26:39.991
THIS IS BEEN GOING ON FOR TWO

02:26:40.057 --> 02:26:41.626
DECADES YES.

02:26:41.692 --> 02:26:44.295
OF ITS IT DIDN'T JUST.

02:26:44.362 --> 02:26:45.696
YOU KNOW THE ISSUED ON THE

02:26:45.763 --> 02:26:47.932
DANGERS HAVE BEEN KNOWN FOR

02:26:47.999 --> 02:26:48.966
DECADES.

02:26:49.033 --> 02:26:51.769
AND SO ARE THE QUESTION FOR ME

02:26:51.836 --> 02:26:53.738

IN DANGER.

02:26:59.710 --> 02:27:01.712
AND WE SHOULD PUSH OURSELVES TO

02:27:01.779 --> 02:27:03.714
COME UP WITH THOSE ANSWERS MUCH

02:27:03.781 --> 02:27:05.316
SOONER.

02:27:05.383 --> 02:27:07.685
AND NOT LET DECADES GO BY.

02:27:07.752 --> 02:27:09.453
OF A YOU KNOW WITHOUT DOING

02:27:09.520 --> 02:27:11.389
SOMETHING SIGNIFICANT ABOUT IT

02:27:11.455 --> 02:27:13.724
AND THAT'S AND THAT'S OUR POINT

02:27:13.791 --> 02:27:14.292
TODAY.

02:27:14.358 --> 02:27:15.459
IS IS GONE TO THE POINT WHERE

02:27:15.526 --> 02:27:17.995
THE SCIENCE IS IRREFUTABLE.

02:27:18.062 --> 02:27:21.499
LET'S DO SOMETHING AND NOT KEEP.

02:27:21.566 --> 02:27:23.401
PUTTING IT OFF AND PUTTING IT

02:27:23.467 --> 02:27:25.836
OFF AND PUTTING IT OFF LIKE I'M

GLAD TO HEAR THERE ARE.

02:27:27.071 --> 02:27:28.673
ALTERNATIVES THAT ARE BEING

02:27:28.739 --> 02:27:31.542
LOOKED AT AND LET'S PUSH ON THE

02:27:31.609 --> 02:27:33.511
ALTERNATIVE I GUESS MY QUESTION

02:27:33.578 --> 02:27:34.979
FOR LAUREN IS I MEAN ALONG THESE

02:27:35.046 --> 02:27:35.646
LINES.

02:27:35.713 --> 02:27:37.048
VIEW THIS.

02:27:37.114 --> 02:27:38.816
THIS BILL DOES IT IS NOT JUST AN

02:27:38.883 --> 02:27:41.419
HOUR RATED IT IT OUTLAWS -- THE

02:27:41.485 --> 02:27:43.688
PESTICIDE IN TILL SUCH TIME AS

02:27:43.754 --> 02:27:44.822
THE DIRECTOR OF THE P. R. ISSUES

02:27:44.889 --> 02:27:46.157
CONTROL MEASURES WHICH DETERMINE

02:27:46.224 --> 02:27:48.059
THE PRODUCTIVE TRIP CHILDREN'S

02:27:48.125 --> 02:27:48.793
NEURAL DEVELOPMENT.

02:27:48.859 --> 02:27:49.560
SO.

02:27:49.627 --> 02:27:51.529
PERHAPS IN THERE THERE'S SOME

02:27:51.596 --> 02:27:53.331
WIGGLE ROOM TO ALLOW FOR THE

02:27:53.397 --> 02:27:58.302
KIND OF STRONG RESPONSE -- IN A

02:27:58.369 --> 02:27:59.971
YOU KNOW IN A IN IN THE CASE OF

02:28:00.037 --> 02:28:01.472
A STILL IT OUT BREAK.

02:28:01.539 --> 02:28:02.873
I AS LONG AS THERE ARE MEASURES

02:28:02.940 --> 02:28:04.942
TAKEN.

02:28:05.009 --> 02:28:10.648
TO PROTECT KIDS I MEAN IF THERE

02:28:10.715 --> 02:28:16.053
IS AN EMERGENCY SITUATION --

02:28:16.120 --> 02:28:17.455
EIGHT YEAH YOU KNOW WE WE

02:28:17.521 --> 02:28:18.389
BELIEVE AS WRITTEN THE

02:28:18.456 --> 02:28:20.591
AMENDMENTS REALLY ARE A BAN

02:28:20.658 --> 02:28:21.659
BECAUSE OF THAT CLEAR AND

02:28:21.726 --> 02:28:22.960
CONVINCING STANDARD IS CONFUSING

02:28:23.027 --> 02:28:24.395
IT THROWS THE REGULATORY SYSTEM

02:28:24.462 --> 02:28:25.863
JUST KIND OF ON ITS HEAD.

02:28:25.930 --> 02:28:28.566
AND BUT I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE

02:28:28.633 --> 02:28:31.902
SAYING AND WE WOULD ENCOURAGE --

02:28:31.969 --> 02:28:33.037
THE YOU KNOW THE INDUSTRIES

02:28:33.104 --> 02:28:34.872
WORKING WTH DPR TO TRY TO

02:28:34.939 --> 02:28:35.539
FIGURE THIS OUT DEEP YOU'RE

02:28:35.606 --> 02:28:37.675
RIGHT NOW IS WORKING WITH CARBON

02:28:37.742 --> 02:28:38.609
A WE HAN.

02:28:38.676 --> 02:28:40.211
ON THESE INTERIM MEASURES TO

02:28:40.278 --> 02:28:42.947
ENSURE THAT NO ONE IS BEING

02:28:43.014 --> 02:28:44.515
HARMED WE HAVE DEEP HEARING CDFA

02:28:44.582 --> 02:28:46.651
THAT IS REGULARLY TESTING FOOD

02:28:46.717 --> 02:28:47.518
TO MAKE SURE THERE'S NO RESIDUE

02:28:47.585 --> 02:28:48.085
ON IT.

02:28:48.152 --> 02:28:49.720
SO ARGUMENT IS THAT A LOT OF

02:28:49.787 --> 02:28:51.656
THIS IS ALREADY BEING DONE HERE

02:28:51.722 --> 02:28:53.024
IN CALIFORNIA FORGET WHAT THE

02:28:53.090 --> 02:28:55.726
FEDS ARE DOING CALIFORNIA IS.

02:28:55.793 --> 02:28:57.128
PUSHING VERY HARD AND HAS

02:28:57.194 --> 02:28:59.597
RESTRICTED THE USE SO MUCH IN

02:28:59.664 --> 02:29:01.666
VERY SPECIFIC QUANTITIES.

02:29:01.732 --> 02:29:02.967
THAT WE'RE BEING INCREDIBLY

02:29:03.034 --> 02:29:05.436
PROTECTIVE OF HUMAN HEALTH UNDER

02:29:05.503 --> 02:29:07.471
THESE MITIGATION MEASURES AND

02:29:07.538 --> 02:29:08.773
RESTRICTIONS THAT ARE HERE IN

02:29:08.839 --> 02:29:11.275
CALIFORNIA -- SO I I I DO THINK

02:29:11.342 --> 02:29:12.243
WE CAN WORK WITH THE P. ARE YOU

02:29:12.310 --> 02:29:13.844
KNOW WHAT IS A MORE THEY THEY DO

02:29:13.911 --> 02:29:15.146
HAVE PROCEDURES IN PLACE FOR

02:29:15.212 --> 02:29:19.183
CERTAIN EMERGENCIES I THINK THIS

02:29:19.250 --> 02:29:19.583
BILL WOULD.

02:29:19.650 --> 02:29:21.385
STOP THAT.

02:29:21.452 --> 02:29:22.687
YES I GUESS I MEAN I GUESS MY

02:29:22.753 --> 02:29:24.755
ARM QUESTION FOR THE AUTHOR TO

CONSIDER IS.

02:29:27.692 --> 02:29:29.093
I HEAR THEY ARE I MEAN THE ART

02:29:29.160 --> 02:29:31.028
CITRUS INDUSTRY IS JUST FREAKED

02:29:31.095 --> 02:29:32.463
OUT ABOUT [inaudible]

02:29:32.530 --> 02:29:34.398
THE SILICON.

02:29:34.465 --> 02:29:35.666
AND HAVING SOMETHING SIMILAR

02:29:35.733 --> 02:29:38.602

BUT I'VE DELVED INTO THE NEW

02:29:46.677 --> 02:29:47.478
UNIX ISSUE BECAUSE I WAS

02:29:47.545 --> 02:29:48.913
CONCERNED ABOUT IMPACT ON

02:29:48.979 --> 02:29:50.381
POLLINATORS AND BEES.

I AND YES SPEND SOMETIME TALKING

02:29:52.350 --> 02:29:53.184
THE FARMERS IN THE CENTRAL

02:29:53.250 --> 02:29:55.686
VALLEY IN AND JUST GOT A A SENSE

02:29:55.753 --> 02:29:56.620
OF OF THE DEPTH OF THEIR CONCERN

02:29:56.687 --> 02:29:58.289
THERE.

02:29:58.356 --> 02:29:59.690
YOU KNOW I WONDER IF YOU KNOW

02:29:59.757 --> 02:30:01.492
WHAT THE BILL MOVING FORWARD IF

02:30:01.559 --> 02:30:02.493
THERE IF THERE COULD BE SOME

02:30:02.560 --> 02:30:04.128
SORT OF I MEAN I I'M SURE THIS

02:30:04.195 --> 02:30:07.765
pTO BE HAPPY WITH THE BILL BUT

02:30:07.832 --> 02:30:10.201
FROM A YEAH FROM FROM SOME THE

02:30:10.267 --> 02:30:11.535
CONCERNS YOU HEARING FROM THE

02:30:11.602 --> 02:30:12.169
COMMITTEE I WONDER IF THERE BE A

02:30:12.236 --> 02:30:16.340
WAY. FOR US TO TO CREATE A

02:30:16.407 --> 02:30:18.576
ANOTHER FLEXIBILITY IN THE BILL.

02:30:18.642 --> 02:30:20.845
THAT WOULD ALLOW.

02:30:20.911 --> 02:30:21.912
FOR SOME SORT OF EMERGENCY

02:30:21.979 --> 02:30:23.781
RESPONSE TO BE TAKEN THAT COULD

02:30:23.848 --> 02:30:25.549
BE VERY CONTROLLED AND TARGETED

02:30:25.616 --> 02:30:27.418
AND I WHERE WHERE WE REALLY

02:30:27.485 --> 02:30:29.253
WOULD HAVE A STRONG.

02:30:29.320 --> 02:30:30.955
I SENSE OF OF CONFIDENCE THAT

02:30:31.021 --> 02:30:32.456
IT'S NOT GOING TO PACK KIDS BUT

02:30:32.523 --> 02:30:33.624

02:30:41.966 --> 02:30:43.901
LOT OF EXPERTISE IN ENGAGEMENT --

02:30:43.968 --> 02:30:45.102
I UNDERSTAND THEY'RE NOT GOING

02:30:45.169 --> 02:30:46.737

02:30:46.804 --> 02:30:48.973
PESTICIDE IN GENERAL ARE BUT I I

02:30:49.039 --> 02:30:49.840
WONDER WHETHER THAT COULD BE

02:30:49.907 --> 02:30:51.041
SOMETHING THAT YOU WOULD SPEND

THERE ARE IN SUCH A VALLEY.

02:31:08.259 --> 02:31:11.028
SO HARD TO REGULATE AND CONTROL

02:31:11.095 --> 02:31:12.963
THAT'S ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT WE

02:31:13.030 --> 02:31:15.866
RAN INTO IN THE ISSUE THE NEO

02:31:15.933 --> 02:31:16.600
NECKS.

TIME. TO KIND OF DELVE INTO --

02:31:33.317 --> 02:31:34.885
THE POSSIBILITY OF A VERY

02:31:34.952 --> 02:31:37.254
TARGETED EMERGENCY RESPONSE IN

02:31:37.321 --> 02:31:39.523

02:33:13.617 --> 02:33:16.153
MANY DIED FARMWORKERS LATER WE

02:33:16.220 --> 02:33:18.455
COULDN'T GET THAT SO I WOULD

02:33:18.522 --> 02:33:20.658
JUST CAUTION THE LEGISLATIVE

02:33:20.724 --> 02:33:22.359
BODY AS WE LOOK AT REGULATIONS

02:33:22.426 --> 02:33:23.627
AND THAT PROCESS AND WHAT THE

02:33:23.694 --> 02:33:25.496
DAMAGE.

02:33:25.563 --> 02:33:27.565
HAS BEEN DONE IN TERMS OF

02:33:27.631 --> 02:33:28.933
FARMWORKERS AND THEIR LIVES AS

02:33:28.999 --> 02:33:29.934
ARE OUT THERE.

02:33:30.000 --> 02:33:33.170
I WOULD JUST JUMP BACK INTO VERY

02:33:33.237 --> 02:33:34.605
INTO.

02:33:34.672 --> 02:33:36.440
YOUR GAUGE.

02:33:36.507 --> 02:33:38.976
WE CAN'T LEAVE THIS OPEN ENDED

02:33:39.043 --> 02:33:40.244
TO SOME DISCRETION ON THERE WITH

02:33:40.311 --> 02:33:41.612
YOU I MEAN THEY GIVE IF THERE

02:33:41.679 --> 02:33:43.547
ARE SOME WIDE OPEN DOOR NO WAY

02:33:43.614 --> 02:33:44.448
RIGHT THAT'S NOT GONNA WORK NO

02:33:44.515 --> 02:33:45.883
AND I AND I'M NOT TRYING TO

02:33:45.950 --> 02:33:46.984
SQUISH AROUND THIS ISSUE AND

02:33:47.051 --> 02:33:48.686
SORT OF GIVE SOME OPEN ENDED UP.

02:33:48.752 --> 02:33:49.987
FORTY THAT'S REALLY A BACK DOOR

02:33:50.054 --> 02:33:50.754
TO JUST CONTINUE DOING WHAT

02:33:50.821 --> 02:33:52.222
WE'RE DOING THE PEOPLE ARE

02:33:52.289 --> 02:33:53.791
HURTING AND PEOPLE HAVE SERIOUS

02:33:53.857 --> 02:33:55.759
DISEASES NSWER ANY DISPUTE

02:33:55.826 --> 02:33:57.728
ABOUT THE AUTISM STUDY GOING

02:33:57.795 --> 02:33:59.296
BACK IN TIME THE STAFF IS DEAD.

02:33:59.363 --> 02:34:02.666
SERIOUS AND DEADLY SO I'M THERE

02:34:02.733 --> 02:34:04.268
JUST TO DO SOME THOUGHT BEFORE

02:34:04.335 --> 02:34:06.503
I'M I'M I'M I'LL BE SUPPORTING

02:34:06.570 --> 02:34:07.304
TODAY ABSOLUTELY.

02:34:07.371 --> 02:34:09.106
GIVE SOME WORK LET'S WORK ON

02:34:09.173 --> 02:34:10.240
THIS THOUGH AND AND AND AND

02:34:10.307 --> 02:34:15.512
ENGAGE WITH THE CITRUS FOLKS IN

02:34:15.579 --> 02:34:16.880
START FIGURING OUT LIKE.

02:34:16.947 --> 02:34:17.915
WHAT IS THE AVERAGE LOOK LIKE

02:34:17.982 --> 02:34:18.916
HOW DO WE?

02:34:18.983 --> 02:34:19.984
IF IT IS ABOUT FUNDING

02:34:20.050 --> 02:34:21.118
ACCELERATING ALTERNATIVES HOW DO

02:34:21.185 --> 02:34:22.720
WE FUND THAT HOW WE GET THINGS

02:34:22.786 --> 02:34:25.322
IN THE MARKET FASTER -- AND THEN

02:34:25.389 --> 02:34:27.057
IN THIS OUTBREAK CASE LIKE JUST

02:34:27.124 --> 02:34:28.225
WHAT'S THE PLAN LIKE LET'S JUST

02:34:28.292 --> 02:34:30.094
BE UP FRONT ABOUT IT AND THEN

02:34:30.160 --> 02:34:31.495
WE'RE GOING IN EYES WIDE OPEN

02:34:31.562 --> 02:34:33.464
EVERYONE FEELS COMFORTABLE LIKE

02:34:33.530 --> 02:34:34.665
THERE ACTUALLY IS A PLAN.

02:34:34.732 --> 02:34:37.401
BUT WE WE CAN'T GO BACKWARDS AND

02:34:37.468 --> 02:34:39.003
IT YOU KNOW THIS IS.

02:34:39.069 --> 02:34:41.672
THIS IS GOT END IT'S JUST IT'S A

02:34:41.739 --> 02:34:44.675
IT'S A TIMING A TO IT'S IT'S

02:34:44.742 --> 02:34:47.211
HIGH I I YEAH IT'S A IT'S IT'S

02:34:47.277 --> 02:34:50.481
ABOUT THIS TRANSITION AND DOING

02:34:50.547 --> 02:34:52.683
NO HARM TO PEOPLE.

02:34:52.750 --> 02:34:54.718
AND THIS INDUSTRY IN THE PROCESS

02:34:54.785 --> 02:34:56.220
THANK YOU ANYWAY I'M THERE I

02:34:56.286 --> 02:34:57.655
THANKS FOR INDULGING THE THE

02:34:57.721 --> 02:34:59.790
CONVERSATION AND LISTINGS AND

02:34:59.857 --> 02:35:00.824
POOR AND ONE AND AND IT'S ONE I

02:35:00.891 --> 02:35:01.959
THINK I JUST THINK THE SILLY

02:35:02.026 --> 02:35:03.394
ISSUES WHEN IT A LOT OF FOLKS

02:35:03.460 --> 02:35:04.762
AREN'T VERY AWARE OF WHO AREN'T.

02:35:04.828 --> 02:35:07.164
DEEPLY ENGAGED IN THE INDUSTRY --

02:35:07.231 --> 02:35:13.404
FONG INDUSTRY A CENTER CASKEY.

02:35:13.470 --> 02:35:15.139
SYSTEM THEY GIVE US A CHAIR --

02:35:15.205 --> 02:35:15.939
GET OUT THERE THERE'S NO SUCH

02:35:16.006 --> 02:35:17.274
THING AS A AS SAFE INSECTICIDE

02:35:17.341 --> 02:35:18.442
OKAY I MEAN THESE THESE

02:35:18.509 --> 02:35:19.810
CHEMICALS ARE DESIGNED TO KILL

02:35:19.877 --> 02:35:21.512
LIVING CREATURES.

02:35:21.578 --> 02:35:22.880
AND IF YOU ARE EXPOSED TO THEM

02:35:22.946 --> 02:35:24.548
ENOUGH AS A HUMAN BEING YOU'RE

02:35:24.615 --> 02:35:26.216
GOING TO GET YOURSELF SET.

02:35:26.283 --> 02:35:27.151
I MEAN I GOT A FRIEND OF MINE

02:35:27.217 --> 02:35:29.386
THAT -- WANTED TO KILL SOME ANTS

02:35:29.453 --> 02:35:31.588
IN HIS GARAGE BE SPRAYED FRANCE

02:35:31.655 --> 02:35:33.424
AND CLOSES GARAGE DOOR.

02:35:33.490 --> 02:35:35.092
ANY LOSSES HERE FOR FIVE YEARS

02:35:35.159 --> 02:35:35.759
YOU DID READ THE ARMOR ACTIONS

02:35:35.826 --> 02:35:36.627
LIKE I'D READ ALL THIS

02:35:36.694 --> 02:35:37.961
INSECTICIDE IN AND STILL

02:35:38.028 --> 02:35:39.763
SUFFERING FROM THE CONSEQUENCES

02:35:39.830 --> 02:35:41.165
MY DAD WAS A SPRAY PAINTER.

02:35:41.231 --> 02:35:43.367
I HAD HIS OWN BUSINESS A LOS

02:35:43.434 --> 02:35:44.568
ANGELES -- THERE WERE THE

02:35:44.635 --> 02:35:46.003
WARNINGS ABOUT LEAD BASED PAINTS

02:35:46.070 --> 02:35:47.571
WHEN HE WAS SPRING AND WASHING

02:35:47.638 --> 02:35:48.338
ITS HANDS WITH LACQUER THINNER

02:35:48.405 --> 02:35:51.575
AND UNFORTUNATELY PASSED AWAY.

02:35:51.642 --> 02:35:52.843
FROM -- WITH THE THEY CALLED

02:35:52.910 --> 02:35:54.078
ALZHEIMER' BUT IT WAS REALLY

02:35:54.144 --> 02:35:56.714
THE ORGANIC SOLVENTS IN THE LEAD

02:35:56.780 --> 02:35:56.914
THAT.

02:35:56.980 --> 02:35:58.515
THAT POISON MY MY DAD.

02:35:58.582 --> 02:36:00.350
AND THERE CERTAINLY WASN'T THE

02:36:00.417 --> 02:36:01.852
THE THE REALIZATION WITH A

02:36:01.919 --> 02:36:04.354
FARMWORKERS DECADES AGO ABOUT

02:36:04.421 --> 02:36:06.523
THE TOXICITIES OF THE THE

02:36:06.590 --> 02:36:08.125
CHEMICALS ARE BEING USE ARMIES

02:36:08.192 --> 02:36:10.294
ARE WASN'T -- EMPHASIZED -- THEY

02:36:10.360 --> 02:36:12.629
WERE JUST TRYING TO MAKE SURE WE

02:36:12.696 --> 02:36:16.800
COULD BEAT OUR STATE AND AND AND

02:36:16.867 --> 02:36:18.569
AND PETER COUNTRY -- WHAT'S

02:36:18.635 --> 02:36:19.703
WE'VE HEARD FROM THE INDUSTRY IS

02:36:19.770 --> 02:36:20.237
THAT.

02:36:20.304 --> 02:36:21.972
WE SEE A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN

02:36:22.039 --> 02:36:23.574
THE UTILIZATION OF THIS CHEMICAL

02:36:23.640 --> 02:36:24.641
BECAUSE THEY UNDERSTAND THAT

02:36:24.708 --> 02:36:25.976
THERE ARE SOME HEALTH RISKS

02:36:26.043 --> 02:36:28.045
ASSOCIATED WITH IT.

02:36:28.112 --> 02:36:29.480
AND AND SENATOR STERN WANTED TO

02:36:29.546 --> 02:36:31.915
SAY THAT WE SHOULD DO EVERYTHING

02:36:31.982 --> 02:36:34.017
OTHER ALTERNATIVE CHEMICALS ON

02:36:34.084 --> 02:36:36.487
THE MARKET TO REPLACE THIS THE

02:36:36.553 --> 02:36:38.188
MAY IN FACT BE SAFER.

02:36:38.255 --> 02:36:39.156
BUT THEY'RE GOING THROUGH THEIR

02:36:39.223 --> 02:36:40.357
DUE DILIGENCE THAT I DON'T THINK

02:36:40.424 --> 02:36:42.025
IT GOVERNMENT THAT NEEDS TO PUSH

02:36:42.092 --> 02:36:43.560
THOSE CHEMICALS TO THE FOREFRONT.

02:36:43.627 --> 02:36:45.596
IT'S THE MARKETABILITY IN THE

02:36:45.662 --> 02:36:47.231
PROFITABILITY THOSE COMPANIES TO

02:36:47.297 --> 02:36:48.799
GET THOSE SAFER INSECTICIDES ON

02:36:48.866 --> 02:36:50.667
THE MARKET.

02:36:50.734 --> 02:36:52.202
SO LET ME JUST GIVE YOU ONE

02:36:52.269 --> 02:36:52.803
QUICK EXAMPLE ANOTHER ONE IF I

02:36:52.870 --> 02:36:54.138
MAY.

02:36:54.204 --> 02:36:55.672
WE HAD AN ISSUE IN THE TO MACULA

02:36:55.739 --> 02:36:56.807
ONE COUNTRY CALLED THE GLASSY

02:36:56.874 --> 02:36:58.208
WINGED SHARPSHOOTER.

02:36:58.275 --> 02:37:00.611
IT DOESN'T MADE A 20% OF OUR

02:37:00.677 --> 02:37:01.612
VINE I WAS COUNTY SUPERVISOR AT

02:37:01.678 --> 02:37:02.880
THE TIME.

02:37:02.946 --> 02:37:04.615
I WAS GETTING CALLS FROM

02:37:04.681 --> 02:37:05.849
DEVELOPER SAYING HEY WE LIKE TO

02:37:05.916 --> 02:37:07.217
BUY THAT THREE HUNDRED ACRE

02:37:07.284 --> 02:37:09.253
VINEYARD SIDE WE WANT TO PUT

02:37:09.319 --> 02:37:10.053
SEVENTY TWO HUNDRED SQUARE FOOT

02:37:10.120 --> 02:37:11.588
LOTS AND BUILD HOMES.

02:37:11.655 --> 02:37:12.756
AND I SAID NO I SAID WE ARE

02:37:12.823 --> 02:37:14.591
GOING TO WORK WITH OUR

02:37:14.658 --> 02:37:15.425
INSTITUTION YOU SEE ARE WE'RE

02:37:15.492 --> 02:37:16.593
GONNA FIND A CURE FOR THIS I'M A

02:37:16.660 --> 02:37:18.529
PUT A CIRCLE AROUND TWENTY FIVE

02:37:18.595 --> 02:37:19.463
THOUSAND ACRES.

02:37:19.530 --> 02:37:20.097
EVER GOING TO PRESERVE THAT ONE

02:37:20.164 --> 02:37:21.064
COUNTRY.

02:37:21.131 --> 02:37:22.633
AND WE DID WE ALSO WENT TO THE

02:37:22.699 --> 02:37:24.968
STATE LOOKING FOR ASSISTANCE THE

02:37:25.035 --> 02:37:25.836
COUNTY PUT UP A QUARTER MILLION

02:37:25.903 --> 02:37:27.371
DOLLARS IMMACULATE BUT A POOR TO

02:37:27.437 --> 02:37:28.105
MILLION.

02:37:28.172 --> 02:37:28.639
AND THEN WE SAW SENATOR

02:37:28.705 --> 02:37:30.774
FEINSTEIN THAT RECOGNIZE IT IF

02:37:30.841 --> 02:37:32.342
WE DON'T TACKLE THIS PROBLEM IN

02:37:32.409 --> 02:37:34.111
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA IT'S GOING

02:37:34.178 --> 02:37:35.078
TO MIGRATE TO NAPA WE'RE GOING

02:37:35.145 --> 02:37:36.413
TO DECIMATE.

02:37:36.480 --> 02:37:38.482
A MAJOR INDUSTRY IN THE STATE OF

02:37:38.549 --> 02:37:39.483
CALIFORNIA.

02:37:39.550 --> 02:37:40.751
WELL WE DID FIND A CURE FOR YOU

02:37:40.818 --> 02:37:42.486
SEE OUR WE PRESERVE OUR WINE

02:37:42.553 --> 02:37:43.720
COUNTRY THE GLASSY WINGED

02:37:43.787 --> 02:37:45.722
SHARPSHOOTER IS NO LONGER A

02:37:45.789 --> 02:37:48.125
MAJOR THREAT FOR NAPA AND SONOMA

02:37:48.192 --> 02:37:52.229
AND CENTRAL VALLEY -- HERE WELL

02:37:52.296 --> 02:37:54.431
IN MY DISTRICT I MEAN.

02:37:54.498 --> 02:37:55.766
SUN KISSED WAS FOUND IN

02:37:55.833 --> 02:37:56.900
RIVERSIDE COUNTY WHERE AN

02:37:56.967 --> 02:37:59.002
AGRICULTURAL COUNTY WE HAVE A

02:37:59.069 --> 02:38:01.638
pWE HAVEN'T HAD TOO MUCH OF THE

02:38:01.705 --> 02:38:03.273
SILLY IT.

02:38:03.340 --> 02:38:05.742
BUT IF YOU OUTLAW THIS CHEMICAL

02:38:05.809 --> 02:38:06.844
WHIH IS THE BACKSTOPS.

02:38:06.910 --> 02:38:07.878
AND THERE'S NO OTHER

02:38:07.945 --> 02:38:09.379
ALTERNATIVES TO STOP THIS

02:38:09.446 --> 02:38:11.114
POTENTIAL DEVASTATION ON OUR

02:38:11.181 --> 02:38:12.082
AGRICULTURE IN THE STATE OF

02:38:12.149 --> 02:38:15.485
CALIFORNIA WHY WOULD WE DO THAT.

02:38:15.552 --> 02:38:16.186
I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH HAVE

02:38:16.253 --> 02:38:17.154
COMING UP WITH SOME ADDITIONAL

02:38:17.221 --> 02:38:19.523
STEPS THAT ARE NECESSARY BEFORE

02:38:19.590 --> 02:38:20.657
AN AD COMMISSIONER AND A COUNTY

02:38:20.724 --> 02:38:22.259
CAN AUTHORIZE THE UTILIZATION OF

02:38:22.326 --> 02:38:23.360
THIS.

02:38:23.427 --> 02:38:24.628
BUT WE HAVE TO KEEP THIS IN OUR

02:38:24.695 --> 02:38:26.563
ARMAMENT TARIAN UNTIL THESE

02:38:26.630 --> 02:38:27.164
OTHER.

02:38:27.231 --> 02:38:28.799
INSECTICIDES COME ON THE MARKET

02:38:28.866 --> 02:38:30.033
SO WE DON'T DECIMATED OUR

02:38:30.100 --> 02:38:32.369
AGRICULTURAL -- BUSINESS HERE IN

02:38:32.436 --> 02:38:33.637
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHICH IS

02:38:33.704 --> 02:38:36.039
A MULTI BILLION DOLLAR INDUSTRY.

02:38:36.106 --> 02:38:38.609
SO -- I CAN'T SUPPORT THE BILL

02:38:38.675 --> 02:38:40.210
BECAUSE I'M NOT GOING TO PUT MY

02:38:40.277 --> 02:38:42.212
FARMERS IN IN HARM'S WAY OF

02:38:42.279 --> 02:38:43.747
LOSING THEIR INVESTMENTS AND

02:38:43.814 --> 02:38:46.083
BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE QUALITY

02:38:46.149 --> 02:38:47.351
CITRUS.

02:38:47.417 --> 02:38:49.486
COMING FROM RIVERSIDE COUNTY --

02:38:49.553 --> 02:38:51.521
UNTIL WE HAVE AN ALTERNATIVE

02:38:51.588 --> 02:38:53.991
THAT CAN REPLACE THAT BACKSTOPS

02:38:54.057 --> 02:38:55.525
BECAUSE YOU HEARD THE WASH DON'T

02:38:55.592 --> 02:38:57.494
DO IT THERE IS NO ALTERNATIVE

02:38:57.561 --> 02:38:59.596
INSECTICIDE TO THAT CAN DO IT.

02:38:59.663 --> 02:39:01.732
SO WE NEED TO KEEP THAT ONE

02:39:01.798 --> 02:39:03.567
CHEMICAL I HAVEN'T HEARD OF

02:39:03.634 --> 02:39:05.202
PATHOLOGISTS COMING FORWARD AND

02:39:05.269 --> 02:39:06.403
TOXICOLOGIST COMING FORWARD AND

02:39:06.470 --> 02:39:07.571
SAYING WE HAVE CHILDREN BEING

02:39:07.638 --> 02:39:10.073
POISONED AND THE THEIR COGNITIVE --

02:39:10.140 --> 02:39:11.875
ISSUES OR OR THERE AND IT'S

02:39:11.942 --> 02:39:14.578
CAUSING UTISM WHERE THEY WORSE

02:39:14.645 --> 02:39:16.914
WORSE DPR RESEARCH DID GET DTS

02:39:16.980 --> 02:39:19.616
pUNIQUE STATE WHERE WE HAVE A

02:39:19.683 --> 02:39:20.484
DEPARTMENT.

02:39:20.550 --> 02:39:22.920
THAT CAN EVEN PREAMP THE FEDERAL

02:39:22.986 --> 02:39:24.688
GOVERNMENT OF THE SAY SOMETHING

02:39:24.755 --> 02:39:26.056
A SAFE OF OUR AGENCY SAYS THAT'S

02:39:26.123 --> 02:39:26.957
NOT WHY NOT LET.

02:39:27.024 --> 02:39:28.325
DTS DO THEIR JOB WHY WE'RE

02:39:28.392 --> 02:39:29.626
PREEMPTING THEM THAT'S SETTING A

PROFESSIONALS THAT.

02:39:34.765 --> 02:39:35.565
ALL THEY DO IS THEY HAVE

02:39:35.632 --> 02:39:36.967
PROFESSIONAL TOXICOLOGIST

02:39:37.034 --> 02:39:39.636
RESEARCH BIOLOGIST TO COME UP

02:39:39.703 --> 02:39:41.638
WITH THESE CONCLUSIONS TO ADVISE

02:39:41.705 --> 02:39:42.339
US.

02:39:42.406 --> 02:39:43.273
MANY OF US EARLY PEOPLE I HAVE A

02:39:43.340 --> 02:39:43.907
PIECE OF SCIENCE BACKGROUND I

02:39:43.974 --> 02:39:44.474
UNDERSTAND A LITTLE BIT OF

02:39:44.541 --> 02:39:46.343
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE.

02:39:46.410 --> 02:39:47.544
BUT I DON'T WANNA CRIPPLE THE

02:39:47.611 --> 02:39:49.479

WITH WITH WITH A KNEE JERK

02:39:50.480 --> 02:39:53.550
REACTION. TO A CHEMICAL THAT IS

02:39:53.617 --> 02:39:55.886
NOT BEEN SHOWN TO CAUSE ANY

02:39:59.156 --> 02:40:00.390
IT'S UTILIZATION IS COME DOWN

02:40:00.457 --> 02:40:01.858
SIGNIFICANTLY WE'RE LOOKING FOR

02:40:01.925 --> 02:40:09.633
A LOT TURNS TO REPLACE.

02:40:09.700 --> 02:40:12.703
THOSE REASONS AGAINST PORTABLE.

02:40:12.769 --> 02:40:14.137

02:40:25.415 --> 02:40:27.617
THAT'S VERY FUNNY.

02:40:27.684 --> 02:40:29.686
SURE SENATOR I WOULD RESPOND IN

PROFESSIONALS STATING

02:40:39.830 --> 02:40:41.498
UNEQUIVOCALLY.

02:40:41.565 --> 02:40:44.167

02:40:47.104 --> 02:40:48.105
THEY ALSO STATE THAT NO SAFE

02:40:48.171 --> 02:40:49.539
LEVEL OF EXPOSURE HAS BEEN

02:40:49.606 --> 02:40:50.674
IDENTIFIED I BELIEVE SENATOR

02:41:06.023 --> 02:41:07.557
SO I I THINK THERE'S AMPLE

02:41:07.624 --> 02:41:08.658
SUPPORT FROM SCIENTISTS AND

02:41:08.725 --> 02:41:09.626

02:41:20.337 --> 02:41:21.705
AS THE PR I WOULD ONLY POINT OF

02:41:21.772 --> 02:41:22.572
THE DPR EVALUATION FROM LAST

YEAR.

02:41:22.839 --> 02:41:24.408
FINDING THAT EXPOSURE TO ALL AGE

02:41:24.474 --> 02:41:25.642
GROUPS THROUGH FOOD.

02:41:25.709 --> 02:41:27.611
RESULT IN UNSAFE LEVELS OF

02:41:27.677 --> 02:41:27.878
EXPOSURE.

02:41:27.944 --> 02:41:29.246
EXPOSURE AT ALL AGE GROUPS AND

SPREAD.

02:41:39.056 --> 02:41:39.623
ALSO RESULT IN UNSAFE LEVELS OF

02:41:39.689 --> 02:41:41.258
EXPOSURE.

02:41:41.324 --> 02:41:43.794
SO USEPA CALIFORNIA.

02:41:43.860 --> 02:41:44.795
SCIENTISTS AND HEALTH

02:41:44.861 --> 02:41:46.129
PROFESSIONALS IN THE STATE

02:41:46.196 --> 02:41:47.798
ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

02:41:47.864 --> 02:41:50.734

SO I WOULD ALWAYS SAY THE

02:41:55.105 --> 02:41:56.239
EVIDENCE ISN'T CLEAR AND YOU

02:41:56.306 --> 02:41:57.874
DON'T HAVE TO BELIEVE ME BECAUSE

02:41:57.941 --> 02:41:59.509
I'M FROM INDUSTRY I ITEM BRACE

02:41:59.576 --> 02:42:00.677
THAT.

02:42:00.744 --> 02:42:02.312
BUT YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THE THE

02:42:02.379 --> 02:42:04.347
UNDERLYING DATA THERE'S A STUDY

02:42:04.414 --> 02:42:05.282
UC BERKELEY RIGHT HERE IN

02:42:05.348 --> 02:42:07.551
CALIFORNIA LOOKING AT I. Q..

02:42:07.617 --> 02:42:08.819
THEY FOUND NO ASSOCIATION WITH

02:42:08.885 --> 02:42:10.620
CORPORATE BOSS SAID IN

02:42:10.687 --> 02:42:13.423
CINCINNATI FOUND NO ASSOCIATION

02:42:13.490 --> 02:42:14.624
WITH CORPORATE VICE. TWO

02:42:14.691 --> 02:42:17.227
PUBLICATIONS FROM EUROPE ALSO

02:42:17.294 --> 02:42:17.761
KNOWS THIS ISSUE WITH PER

02:42:17.828 --> 02:42:19.563
PURIFIES IN LOSS OF I. Q. SO WE

02:42:19.629 --> 02:42:22.199
HAVE FOUR STUDIES.

02:42:22.265 --> 02:42:23.433
THE SHOW NO ASSOCIATION WITH

02:42:23.500 --> 02:42:25.068
CORE PURIFIES IN LOSS OF I. Q..

02:42:25.135 --> 02:42:25.702
I'M A GET IT I'M A MOTHER TO WE

02:42:25.769 --> 02:42:28.405
DON'T WE WE AGREE THAT WE WANT

02:42:28.472 --> 02:42:29.005
TO PROTECT OUR CHILDREN I GET

02:42:29.072 --> 02:42:30.440
THAT.

02:42:30.507 --> 02:42:31.641
BUT WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THE FRONT

02:42:31.708 --> 02:42:34.144
UNDERLYING SCIENTIFIC DATA.

02:42:34.211 --> 02:42:35.712
THAT HAS BEEN ROLLING OUT SINCE

02:42:35.779 --> 02:42:37.581
THE COLUMBIA STUDY WAS PUBLISHED

02:42:37.647 --> 02:42:38.815
IN THE ISN'T SUPPORTING THOSE

02:42:38.882 --> 02:42:40.650
STUDY.

02:42:40.717 --> 02:42:41.985
OKAY I MEAN I GUESS I DO TAKE

02:42:42.052 --> 02:42:44.054
COMFORT FROM THE FACT THAT THE

02:42:44.121 --> 02:42:45.422
BILL AND I UNDERSTAND IT MAY BE

02:42:45.489 --> 02:42:47.157
YEAH.

02:42:47.224 --> 02:42:48.358
BARS ARE STANDARDS THAT THAT THE

02:42:48.425 --> 02:42:49.192
INDUSTRY BECAUSE THERE'S TOO

02:42:49.259 --> 02:42:50.994
HIGH BUT YOU KNOW IT REALLY.

02:42:51.061 --> 02:42:52.562
YOU KNOW IF IF.

02:42:52.629 --> 02:42:53.697
WHEN WHEN IF THE DPR FEELS

02:42:53.763 --> 02:42:55.298
COMFORTABLE ISSUING YOU THAT

02:42:55.365 --> 02:42:56.099
THAT THEY'VE GOT CONTROL

02:42:56.166 --> 02:42:57.634
MEASURES IN PLACE THAT ARE

02:42:57.701 --> 02:42:58.835
DETERMINED TO BE PRODUCTIVE OF?

02:42:58.902 --> 02:43:01.638
CHILDREN'S NO DEVELOPMENT.

02:43:01.705 --> 02:43:03.039
THE YEAH THE THE USE OF THE

02:43:03.106 --> 02:43:05.542
PESTICIDE WOULD BE.

02:43:05.609 --> 02:43:07.611
AND IF WE ALLOWED -- IF AS LONG

02:43:07.677 --> 02:43:08.945
AS A DVR DETERMINES IF THERE'S

02:43:09.012 --> 02:43:10.947
ENOUGH -- PROTECTION IN PLACE I

02:43:11.014 --> 02:43:14.684
THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT -- YOU

02:43:14.751 --> 02:43:15.886
PROTECTION IN THE BILL FOR

02:43:15.952 --> 02:43:17.621
INDUSTRY I I GUESS I WOULD I

02:43:17.687 --> 02:43:20.090
WOULD SAY THAT -- I WOULD JUST

02:43:20.157 --> 02:43:21.091
KIND OF YOU ASKED THAT WE YOU

02:43:21.158 --> 02:43:22.893
KNOW.

02:43:22.959 --> 02:43:24.461
THIS BILL ISSUES A SERIOUS ISSUE

02:43:24.528 --> 02:43:25.595
AND AND IF THERE I DON'T KNOW I

02:43:25.662 --> 02:43:27.731
MEAN IF THERE IS SOME.

02:43:27.797 --> 02:43:28.532
I I I WOULD ULTIMATELY OBVIOUSLY

02:43:28.598 --> 02:43:29.699
PUT.

02:43:29.766 --> 02:43:33.103
KIDS HEALTH OVER OVER INDUSTRY --

02:43:33.170 --> 02:43:34.638
BUT IF THERE IS SOME WAY IN THE

02:43:34.704 --> 02:43:36.439
CASE OF AN OF A CATASTROPHIC

02:43:36.506 --> 02:43:38.608
EMERGENCY FOR THE INDUSTRY.

02:43:38.675 --> 02:43:40.810
AND ALL THE JOBS AND AND AND THE

02:43:40.877 --> 02:43:41.511
CON ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT SO

02:43:41.578 --> 02:43:43.947
SEATED -- THAT THAT WOULD THAT

02:43:44.014 --> 02:43:45.815
WE COULD FIGURE OUT A PATH THAT

02:43:45.882 --> 02:43:47.117
WOULD PROTECT HEALTH AND THE

02:43:47.184 --> 02:43:48.118
KIDS HEALTH.

02:43:48.185 --> 02:43:49.653
AND FARMWORKERS SELF WHILE ALSO

02:43:49.719 --> 02:43:51.388
PROTECTING THE INDUSTRY AND THAT

02:43:51.454 --> 02:43:52.689
WOULD BE A SMART THING FOR US TO

02:43:52.756 --> 02:43:55.425
DO AND SO I YOU KNOW I'M.

02:43:55.492 --> 02:43:56.660
I ACTUALLY GREW THE CENTER WE WE

02:43:56.726 --> 02:43:59.596
ARE NOT -- THIS TAKE A STEP BACK --

02:43:59.663 --> 02:44:01.464
IN SO.

02:44:01.531 --> 02:44:03.033
I GUESS I I JUST TRY TO GET A

02:44:03.099 --> 02:44:05.035
SENSE FROM YOU IF IF IF.

02:44:05.101 --> 02:44:07.571
IF YOU WANTED TO EXPLORE THAT

02:44:07.637 --> 02:44:09.139
IDEA -- AND AND I WOULD ONLY

02:44:09.206 --> 02:44:10.941
TRIBUTARY GOT INTO THE MOST

02:44:11.007 --> 02:44:13.577
EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES --

02:44:13.643 --> 02:44:14.678
AND I'M NOT ASKING YOU TO TAKE

02:44:14.744 --> 02:44:16.046
ANY FROM COMMITMENT RIGHT NOW

02:44:16.112 --> 02:44:16.680
BUT IF THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING

02:44:16.746 --> 02:44:17.914
YOU'D BE ONE SENSE OF TIME

02:44:17.981 --> 02:44:19.983
LOOKING INTO AND EXPLORING.

02:44:20.050 --> 02:44:21.218
I WITH A COMMITTED LOOK YES WE

02:44:21.284 --> 02:44:22.786
COULD SIT DOWN WITH YOUON IT

02:44:22.852 --> 02:44:25.255
LIKE YOU SAID UNLIKE COMMITTEE.

02:44:25.322 --> 02:44:27.757
YEAH -- UP TO MAKE IN THAT KIND

02:44:27.824 --> 02:44:29.793
OF CHANGE BUT I WOULD

02:44:29.859 --> 02:44:31.595
WE DON'T PRETEND TO FIX ALL OF

02:44:31.661 --> 02:44:33.230
THE ISSUES.

02:44:33.296 --> 02:44:35.465
FACING AGRICULTURE.

02:44:35.532 --> 02:44:37.500
AND OUR FOOD CROPS WITH THIS

02:44:37.567 --> 02:44:39.069
BILL.

02:44:39.135 --> 02:44:41.638
WE HAVE A ONE VERY SPECIFIC

02:44:41.705 --> 02:44:42.172
MISSION.

02:44:42.239 --> 02:44:44.274
AND THAT IS TO PROTECT THOSE

02:44:44.341 --> 02:44:45.408
BABIES.

02:44:45.475 --> 02:44:47.677
WHERE IN A K&lt;c.cyan&gt; SITUATION FOR&lt;/c&gt;

02:44:47.744 --> 02:44:48.812
DECADES?

02:44:48.878 --> 02:44:50.914
DECADES WE HAVE KNOWN OF THE

02:44:50.981 --> 02:44:53.383
HARM THAT IT CAUSES AND IT'S

02:44:53.450 --> 02:44:54.918
ONLY GOTTEN CLEARER AND CLEARER.

02:44:54.985 --> 02:44:57.821
AND I I WOULD I WOULD SAY THIS

02:44:57.887 --> 02:45:01.324
IS AT THIS POINT AT THIS POINT

02:45:01.391 --> 02:45:02.392
IT IS ABOUT.

02:45:02.459 --> 02:45:04.094
WHAT'S THE CHOICE HERE.

02:45:04.160 --> 02:45:06.196
IT SHOULD NOT BE A CHOICE FOR US

02:45:06.263 --> 02:45:08.064
A DIFFICULT CHOICE TO PROTECT

02:45:08.131 --> 02:45:09.666
THOSE BABIES TO PROTECT THOSE

02:45:09.733 --> 02:45:10.533
CHILDREN.

02:45:10.600 --> 02:45:12.636
I WOR IN THE FIELDS UNTIL I WAS

02:45:12.702 --> 02:45:14.070
FIFTEEN YEARS OLD.

02:45:14.137 --> 02:45:16.006
I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE I KNOW THE

02:45:16.072 --> 02:45:18.908
POWER IMBALANCE THAT EXISTS HERE

02:45:18.975 --> 02:45:20.577
AND SO WE'RE REACHING OUT YES TO

02:45:20.644 --> 02:45:22.712
THE LEGISLATURE BECAUSE ALTHOUGH

02:45:22.779 --> 02:45:24.447
WE RELY.

02:45:24.514 --> 02:45:26.816

AND THE JUDICIAL REVIEW PROCESS

03:02:28.404 --> 03:02:29.405
IS THAT SHE WAS ONLY OF COURSE

POP ON THE SUBSTANCE OF SEEK WAS

03:02:38.914 --> 03:02:43.552
NOT AS IMPORTANT AS BUILDING

BUILDING NEW DEVELOPMENT AND

03:03:02.738 --> 03:03:04.473
COMPLETELY REMOVING OF NEW

03:03:04.540 --> 03:03:05.140
DEVELOPMENT FROM C. QUESTION NOT

AUTHOR TO FIND SOME SORT OF NO

DIVERSITY I AGREE WITH ALL OF

03:03:29.698 --> 03:03:31.233
THE POINTS THAT - HERE CALL

03:03:31.300 --> 03:03:33.001
CALIFORNIA JUST RAISED IF I MAY

03:03:33.068 --> 03:03:34.536
SPEAK VERY QUICKLY.

03:03:34.603 --> 03:03:35.604
TWO POINTS AND I WILL MAKE A

03:03:35.671 --> 03:03:37.973
VERY BRIEF ONE IS UP THERE WAS

03:03:38.040 --> 03:03:39.708
OVERWHELMING SUPPORT FOR THE NO

03:03:39.775 --> 03:03:40.709
PLACE LIKE HOME.

03:03:40.776 --> 03:03:42.678
BALLOT MEASURE I MYSELF

03:03:42.745 --> 03:03:45.647
SUPPORTED THAT -- BUT THAT

03:03:45.714 --> 03:03:48.016
MEASURE DID NOT INCLUDE THAT

03:03:48.083 --> 03:03:50.018
THERE WOULD BE A A REDUCTION IN

03:03:50.085 --> 03:03:51.553
THE AMOUNT OF PUBLIC OVERSIGHT

03:03:51.620 --> 03:03:53.021

AND AND THAT LEADS ME TO MY

03:04:00.496 --> 03:04:03.098
SECOND POINT WHICH IS THAT.

03:04:03.165 --> 03:04:04.633
INHERENT IN THE BILL IS THIS

03:04:04.700 --> 03:04:05.567
FAITH.

03:04:05.634 --> 03:04:08.637
THAT THE CITY COUNCIL OR THE

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF THESE

03:04:17.780 --> 03:04:20.416
PROJECTS AND THAT IS SIMPLY NOT

03:04:20.482 --> 03:04:21.617
MY EXPERIENCE THAT IS NOT

03:04:21.683 --> 03:04:23.585

03:04:43.238 --> 03:04:44.740
TO GO FORWARD BUT MAKING THE

03:04:44.807 --> 03:04:46.375
CHANGES THAT ARE NECESSARY TO

03:04:46.442 --> 03:04:48.143
REDUCE THEIR ENVIRONMENTAL

DECADE EXPERIENCE THAT THE SCALE

03:25:12.166 --> 03:25:15.236

JURISDICTIONS THE NUMBER SALTERS

03:25:59.480 --> 03:26:01.082

SHELTERS IN AN INDUSTRIAL ZONE

03:30:51.705 --> 03:30:52.706
IF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT

03:30:52.773 --> 03:30:53.941
DEMONSTRATES THAT THE ZONE.

03:30:54.008 --> 03:30:55.642
IS CONNECTED TO AMENITIES AND

03:30:55.709 --> 03:30:57.544
SERVICES THAT SERVE PEOPLE

03:30:57.611 --> 03:30:58.579

I JUST WANTED TO GET A BETTER

03:30:59.513 --> 03:31:00.981
SENSE.

03:31:01.048 --> 03:31:02.649
OF WHAT EXACTLY MEAN BY THE WORD

03:31:13.494 --> 03:31:14.728
GOAL THERE IS.

03:31:14.795 --> 03:31:17.231
RIGHT IS TO SAY WE DON'T WANNA

03:31:17.297 --> 03:31:19.400
BLANCA PER HAVE INDUSTRIAL ZONE

03:31:19.466 --> 03:31:20.034
BECAUSE HERE ARE SOME

03:31:20.100 --> 03:31:21.001
INDUSTRIAL ZONES ARE COULD BE

03:31:21.068 --> 03:31:23.103
RIGHT NEXT TO WHERE PEOPLE GET

03:31:23.170 --> 03:31:24.738

OF REMOTE DISCONNECTED AREAS --

03:31:29.676 --> 03:31:32.146
AND SO THE GOAL IS TO BE CLOSE

03:31:32.212 --> 03:31:35.883
TO SERVICES -- AND TO JUST TO

03:31:35.949 --> 03:31:41.488
HELP HUMAN BEINGS -- EXIST

INDUSTRIAL ZONE THAT WAS WAY FAR

03:32:19.093 --> 03:32:22.496
FLUNG AND FAR AWAY FROM ANYTHING --

03:32:22.563 --> 03:32:24.131
A GOOD EXAMPLE THOUGH OF AN

03:32:24.198 --> 03:32:25.065
INDUSTRIAL ZONE THAT ALSO MAKES

03:32:25.132 --> 03:32:27.034

03:32:36.477 --> 03:32:38.011
IT'S VERY CLOSE -- TO IT'S WELL

03:32:38.078 --> 03:32:38.846
CONNECTED WITH BIKE

03:32:38.912 --> 03:32:40.080

REAL AND BIKE TRANSPORTATION SO

03:32:43.584 --> 03:32:44.852

03:32:44.918 --> 03:32:46.420
THAT IT'S THOSE SORTS OF THINGS

03:32:46.487 --> 03:32:48.088

03:45:43.696 --> 03:45:45.198
PRODUCED FISH.

03:45:45.265 --> 03:45:46.399
AND THE BILL DOESN'T HAVE A LOT

03:45:46.466 --> 03:45:48.268
OF DETAIL IN ORDER TO VERIFY

03:45:48.334 --> 03:45:49.802
THAT WHAT'S GOING TO BE PROPOSAL

03:45:49.869 --> 03:45:50.803
WHAT WOULD BE IMPLEMENTED CAN

03:45:50.870 --> 03:45:52.171
ACTUALLY INSURE THAT WERE NOT

03:45:52.238 --> 03:45:52.739
IMPACTING NATURALLY PRODUCED

03:45:52.805 --> 03:45:54.507
FISH.

03:45:54.574 --> 03:45:56.142
WE'VE BEEN MEETING WITH THE BILL

03:45:56.209 --> 03:45:58.044
PROPONENTS ON THIS TOPIC.

03:45:58.111 --> 03:45:59.279
AND WE'RE RECOMMENDING THAT

03:45:59.345 --> 03:46:01.114
INSTEAD REFORM SOME SORT OF WORK

03:46:01.180 --> 03:46:01.981
GROUP THAT ALLOWS US TO WORK

03:46:02.048 --> 03:46:03.650
WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND

03:46:03.716 --> 03:46:04.550
WILDLIFE.

03:46:04.617 --> 03:46:05.385
AND A NUMBER OF STAKEHOLDERS

03:46:05.451 --> 03:46:06.619
ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT THE

03:46:06.686 --> 03:46:08.421
RECOMMENDATIONS ON STUDY THAT

03:46:08.488 --> 03:46:09.088
HAVE ALREADY BEEN DONE HATCHERY

03:46:09.155 --> 03:46:09.822
MANAGEMENT.

03:46:09.889 --> 03:46:12.125
ACTUALLY MOVE THE DEPARTMENT OF

03:46:12.191 --> 03:46:13.993
FISH WILDLIFE INTO A BETTER

03:46:14.060 --> 03:46:14.594
HATCHERY MANAGER PLAN FOR THE

03:46:14.661 --> 03:46:15.161
STATE.

03:46:15.228 --> 03:46:16.896
WE ALSO HAVE CONCERNS THAT COST

03:46:16.963 --> 03:46:18.631
AFFILIATED WITH SECTION THREE

PROJECT AND TO THE DEPARTMENT OF

03:46:22.135 --> 03:46:24.137
FISH AND WILDLIFE -- THERE'S NO

03:46:24.203 --> 03:46:26.139
CLEAR NEXUS BETWEEN STATE WATER

03:46:26.205 --> 03:46:29.208
PROJECT AND THESE STUDIES AND

03:46:29.275 --> 03:46:30.209
WE'RE ALSO CONCERNED THAT

03:46:30.276 --> 03:46:31.077
BECAUSE DEPARTMENT OF FISH

03:46:31.144 --> 03:46:32.378
WILDLIFE IS UNDERGOING A MAJOR

03:46:32.445 --> 03:46:34.280
BUDGET REVIEW AND THAT THEY

03:46:34.347 --> 03:46:35.181
REALLY DON'T HAVE ANY FUNDING

03:46:35.248 --> 03:46:36.316
THAT.

03:46:36.382 --> 03:46:36.883
THE FUNDING IS NOT THERE TO

03:46:36.950 --> 03:46:38.051
IMPLEMENT.

03:46:38.117 --> 03:46:39.285
THE SPECIFIC STUDIES THAT ARE

03:46:39.352 --> 03:46:40.920
LISTED HERE SO WE'D RATHER WORK

03:46:40.987 --> 03:46:42.088
TOGETHER TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO

03:46:42.155 --> 03:46:43.756
COOK COMPREHENSIVELY ADDRESS

CALIFORNIA FORESTRY ASSOCIATION

03:46:48.928 --> 03:46:50.396
WE HAVE CONCERNS RELATED TO THE

03:46:50.463 --> 03:46:52.131
TIMBER HARVESTING CHANGES THAT

03:46:52.198 --> 03:46:53.900
THIS BILL WOULD PROPOSE -- WE'VE

03:46:53.967 --> 03:46:55.401
BEEN IN CONVERSATIONS WITH THE

03:46:55.468 --> 03:46:56.703
AUTHOR AND THE SPONSORS OF THIS

03:46:56.769 --> 03:46:58.671
BILL WE'VE ASKED FOR THE STUDIES

03:46:58.738 --> 03:46:59.772
AND INFORMATION THAT THEY SAY

03:46:59.839 --> 03:47:01.174

03:47:03.076 --> 03:47:05.211
INFORMATION LAST WEEK -- WE

03:47:05.278 --> 03:47:07.480
ACTUALLY -- DISAGREE WITH THEIR

03:47:07.547 --> 03:47:09.182
ASSERTION THAT THE STUDIES PROVE

03:47:09.248 --> 03:47:10.550
THEIR POINT IN FACT THE STUDIES

03:47:10.616 --> 03:47:12.752
THAT THEY GAVE US GO BACK AS FAR

03:47:12.819 --> 03:47:14.721
AS TWENTY TWO YEARS AGO -- AND

03:47:14.787 --> 03:47:16.389
THE MOST RECENT STUDY THEY GAVE

03:47:16.456 --> 03:47:18.224
WAS FROM TWENTY TEN SO SINCE

03:47:18.291 --> 03:47:19.592
THAT TIME THERE BEEN SIGNIFICANT

03:47:19.659 --> 03:47:21.060
UPGRADES IN THE FOREST PRACTICE

03:47:21.127 --> 03:47:22.328
RULES THROUGH CAL FIRE THROUGH

03:47:22.395 --> 03:47:23.863
THE BOARD OF FORESTRY IN THE

03:47:23.930 --> 03:47:25.298
OTHER DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES.

03:47:25.365 --> 03:47:27.266
THAT ARE PART OF A MULTI REVIEW

03:47:27.333 --> 03:47:28.001
AGENCY.

03:47:28.067 --> 03:47:29.769
REVIEW THAT IS SEEK WORK WITH

03:47:29.836 --> 03:47:31.137
WANT AND ARE PROCESS UNDER TO

03:47:31.204 --> 03:47:34.140
REHEARSING PLANS -- WE FEEL THAT

03:47:34.207 --> 03:47:34.741
THIS BILL YOU SERVICE THAT A

03:47:34.807 --> 03:47:36.142
THOR THEIR AUTHORITY THAT WE

03:47:36.209 --> 03:47:37.944
CURRENTLY GO THROUGH IN ORDER TO

03:47:38.011 --> 03:47:39.946
HAVE THAT PROCESS -- IN ADDITION

03:47:40.013 --> 03:47:41.447
TO THAT IN THE FOREST PRACTICE

03:47:41.514 --> 03:47:43.116
RULES THERE ARE DIFFERENT RULES

03:47:43.182 --> 03:47:44.417
BASED UPON THE REGIONS OF THE

03:47:44.484 --> 03:47:45.385
STATE IN THE DISTRICT.

03:47:45.451 --> 03:47:47.887
THAT THERE IS SO THIS BILL IS A

03:47:47.954 --> 03:47:49.088
ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH AND

03:47:49.155 --> 03:47:51.224
APPLIES THAT RULE REGARDLESS OF

03:47:51.290 --> 03:47:51.891
THE GEOGRAPHY OR THE AREA OF THE

03:47:51.958 --> 03:47:53.893
STATE THAT WE'RE IN --

03:47:53.960 --> 03:47:55.228
FURTHERMORE WE FEEL LIKE IF

03:47:55.294 --> 03:47:57.330
THERE ARE SPECIAL RULES THAT ARE

03:47:57.397 --> 03:47:57.964
NEEDED.

03:47:58.031 --> 03:47:59.165
IN PARTICULAR PLACES OF THE

03:47:59.232 --> 03:48:01.100
STATE THE FOREST PRACTICE RULES

03:48:01.167 --> 03:48:02.769
ALSO ALLOW COUNTIES TO APPLY

03:48:02.835 --> 03:48:04.470
SPECIFIC RULES TO THEIR COUNTY

03:48:04.537 --> 03:48:06.339
IN SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES THERE

03:48:06.406 --> 03:48:08.107
ARE MULTIPLE IT -- COUNTIES

03:48:08.174 --> 03:48:09.509
ACROSS THE STATE THEY DO HAVE AN

03:48:09.575 --> 03:48:10.877
IMPLEMENT THESE RULES.

03:48:10.943 --> 03:48:12.145
FINALLY WERE CONCERNED THAT

03:48:12.211 --> 03:48:13.446
BECAUSE THIS BILL WOULD THEN PUT

03:48:13.513 --> 03:48:14.647
THOSE RULES IN STATUTE AS

03:48:14.714 --> 03:48:16.883
OPPOSED TO THE FOREST PRACTICE

03:48:16.949 --> 03:48:18.217
RULES THAT IT SORT OF LOCKS IN

03:48:18.284 --> 03:48:19.952
THOSE RULES GOING FORWARD.

03:48:20.019 --> 03:48:22.255
IT PLACES SCIENCE AND A FREEZE

03:48:22.321 --> 03:48:23.289
AT THAT MOMENT IN TIME WE HAVE A

03:48:23.356 --> 03:48:27.193
COUPLE EXAMPLES -- WITH REGARDS --

03:48:27.260 --> 03:48:28.861
TO LARGE WOODY DEBRIS WHICH ONE

03:48:28.928 --> 03:48:30.263
OF THE STUDIES POINTS TO IS

03:48:30.329 --> 03:48:31.798
IMPORTANT TO HAVE.

03:48:31.864 --> 03:48:33.533
THIS LARGE WOODY DEBRIS IN WATER

03:48:33.599 --> 03:48:35.201
TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE SHADE

03:48:35.268 --> 03:48:38.271
PULLING FOR FISH FOOD SOURCES --

03:48:38.337 --> 03:48:39.205
IT WASN'T THAT LONG AGO THAT WE

03:48:39.272 --> 03:48:41.007
THOUGHT THAT HAVING WOOD IN THE

03:48:41.074 --> 03:48:42.475
WATER WAS ACTUALLY A DETRIMENT

03:48:42.542 --> 03:48:43.476
AND WE PULLED IT OUT OF THE

03:48:43.543 --> 03:48:45.678
WATER NOW SCIENCE IS SAYING NO

03:48:45.745 --> 03:48:47.180
NO IT'S GOOD PUT IT BACK IN THE

03:48:47.246 --> 03:48:47.413
WATER.

03:48:47.480 --> 03:48:48.881
IN ADDITION TO THAT A LONG TIME

03:48:48.948 --> 03:48:50.149
AGO WE THOUGHT NORTHERN SPOTTED

03:48:50.216 --> 03:48:51.384
OWLS WHICH ARE ENDANGERED

03:48:51.451 --> 03:48:53.286
SPECIES THAT THEY COULD ONLY

03:48:53.352 --> 03:48:55.188
SURVIVE IN OLD GROWTH FORESTS

03:48:55.254 --> 03:48:57.190
WHAT WE'VE COME TO LEARN IS THAT

03:48:57.256 --> 03:48:58.891
SPOTTED OWLS WILL OFTENTIMES

03:48:58.958 --> 03:48:59.826
MAKE THEIR NESTS IN OLD GROWTH

03:48:59.892 --> 03:49:00.693
FORESTS.

03:49:00.760 --> 03:49:01.627
BUT THEY ACTUALLY LIKE TO BE

03:49:01.694 --> 03:49:04.497
NEAR ARE ON THE EDGE OF WHERE

03:49:04.564 --> 03:49:04.964
THEY HAVE HAD.

03:49:05.031 --> 03:49:06.833
INNINGS IN THE FOREST BECAUSE

03:49:06.899 --> 03:49:07.834
THAT'S WHERE THEY'RE GOING TO

03:49:07.900 --> 03:49:09.735
GET THEIR FOOD SO LIKE WE HAVE A

03:49:09.802 --> 03:49:11.337
KITCHEN AND A FAN AND A BEDROOM

03:49:11.404 --> 03:49:12.171
IN OUR HOUSE.

03:49:12.238 --> 03:49:14.707
THEY ALSO HAVE THEIR OWN KITCHEN

03:49:14.774 --> 03:49:16.576
AND THEIR BEDROOM OLD GROWTH AND

03:49:16.642 --> 03:49:17.877
LIKE TO BE NEAR STANDINGS IT'S

03:49:17.944 --> 03:49:18.878
BECAUSE OF THIS THAT WE HAVE

03:49:18.945 --> 03:49:20.113
CONCERNS WITH THE BILL WOULD

03:49:20.179 --> 03:49:21.547

POTENTIALLY PROVIDE INCENTIVES

03:49:25.718 --> 03:49:27.787
TO LANDOWNERS TO DO ADDITIONAL

03:49:27.854 --> 03:49:31.390
PROTECTIONS -- TO IMPROVE LEGACY

03:49:31.457 --> 03:49:34.327
FORCED ISSUES THANK YOU.

PREVENT TO THE PROVISIONS

03:49:41.501 --> 03:49:43.069
RELATED TO TIMBER HARVEST AND

03:49:43.136 --> 03:49:44.270
FUNDAMENTALLY WITH WITH THIS

03:49:44.337 --> 03:49:46.072
LEGISLATION WHAT THE BILL'S

03:49:46.139 --> 03:49:47.406
DOING FITS USURPING THE CURRENT

03:49:47.473 --> 03:49:48.374
PROCESS THAT WE HAVE NOW WITH

03:49:48.441 --> 03:49:49.809
CAL FIRE ACTING AS THE LEAD

03:49:49.876 --> 03:49:50.643
AGENCY.

03:49:50.710 --> 03:49:52.345
AND THE OTHER AGENCIES INVOLVING

QUALITY CONTROL BOARD AND OTHERS

03:49:55.448 --> 03:49:57.350
HAVING A REVIEW PROCESS AS WELL

03:49:57.416 --> 03:49:58.351
TO GO THROUGH THAT T. H. P. TO

03:49:58.417 --> 03:49:59.819
ENSURE THAT.

03:49:59.886 --> 03:50:01.487
THE RESPECTIVE JURISDICTIONS OF

03:50:01.554 --> 03:50:02.455
THOSE AGENCIES ARE PROTECTED AS

03:50:02.522 --> 03:50:04.023
WELL IF WILDLIFE FOR

03:50:04.090 --> 03:50:05.858
ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS.

03:50:05.925 --> 03:50:06.926
WHAT SB SIXTY NINE DOES THE

03:50:06.993 --> 03:50:09.695
PRICE PLACES WATER QUALITY

03:50:09.762 --> 03:50:11.030
OBJECTIVES ABOVE EVERYTHING ELSE?

03:50:11.097 --> 03:50:11.597
AND WHILE THAT MAY BE WELL

03:50:11.664 --> 03:50:13.599
INTENTIONED AND GOOD.

03:50:13.666 --> 03:50:15.001
THE PROBLEM IS SPECIFICALLY

03:50:15.067 --> 03:50:16.335
RELATES TO SALMON SPECIES AND

03:50:16.402 --> 03:50:16.969
EVERYTHING ELSE WHEN YOU'RE

03:50:17.036 --> 03:50:17.703
REQUIRING.

03:50:17.770 --> 03:50:20.239
SPECIFIC CANOPY LEVELS WHICH IN

03:50:20.306 --> 03:50:21.007
SECTION TWENTY ONE OF THE BILL

03:50:21.073 --> 03:50:22.575
PROVIDES.

03:50:22.642 --> 03:50:24.443
BACK CANOPY AXE WHILE NOT MAYBE

03:50:24.510 --> 03:50:26.479
NECESSARILY BAD FOR SALMON IN

03:50:26.546 --> 03:50:28.948
PARTICULAR IT DOES HAVE OTHER.

03:50:29.015 --> 03:50:30.082
NEGATIVE IMPACTS ANOTHER

03:50:30.149 --> 03:50:31.717
CANDIDATE SPECIES SUCH AS THE

03:50:31.784 --> 03:50:34.187
LIKE A FROG THAT ALSO REPRESENT

A REPRESENTATIVE LIVING HAVE

03:50:36.155 --> 03:50:37.590
HABITAT AND SOME OF THESE AREAS.

03:50:37.657 --> 03:50:40.626
SO WE THE MULTI AGENCY REVIEW IS

03:50:40.693 --> 03:50:41.861
IS VERY CRITICAL TO INSURING A

03:50:41.928 --> 03:50:44.297
BALANCED APPROACH TO ALL OF THE

03:50:44.363 --> 03:50:46.165
CRITERIA SO SHOULD TO TO TIMBER

03:50:46.232 --> 03:50:47.533
HARVEST PROGRAMMER PLAN.

03:50:47.600 --> 03:50:48.834
AS WELL AS ALL OF THE OTHER

03:50:48.901 --> 03:50:50.436
ISSUES THAT MAY HAVE BEEN

03:50:50.503 --> 03:50:52.205
DISCUSSED AS PART OF IT AGAIN

03:50:52.271 --> 03:50:53.239
FOCUSING ON ONE ISSUE A REGIONAL

03:50:53.306 --> 03:50:54.740
WATER QUALITY MIGHT BE FINDING

03:50:54.807 --> 03:50:56.042
GOOD FOR ONE SPECIFIC SECTION

03:50:56.108 --> 03:50:56.976
ONE SPECIFIC ISSUE.

03:50:57.043 --> 03:50:58.911
BUT IT DOESN'T RESOLVE THE OTHER

03:50:58.978 --> 03:51:00.479
ISSUES INVOLVING THE MULTI

03:51:00.546 --> 03:51:03.249
AGENCY JURISDICTION OF THIS OR

03:51:03.316 --> 03:51:05.084
CONCERN OBVIOUSLY LIKE I SAID.

03:51:05.151 --> 03:51:06.953
WE ARE ON DOING THAT PROCESS

03:51:07.019 --> 03:51:07.486
WERE GIVEN ONE AUTHORITY

03:51:07.553 --> 03:51:08.888
ESSENTIALLY.

03:51:08.955 --> 03:51:10.289
THE POWER TO VETO THE TIMBER

03:51:10.356 --> 03:51:12.358
HARVEST PLAN WE BELIEVE THAT'S

03:51:12.425 --> 03:51:13.659
UNNECESSARY GIVEN THE FORCE

03:51:13.726 --> 03:51:15.628
PRACTICE ROLE FOR PRACTICE ACT.

03:51:15.695 --> 03:51:16.195
AND THE UPDATES THAT HAVE

03:51:16.262 --> 03:51:17.964
HAPPENED IN THE LAST LITERALLY

03:51:18.030 --> 03:51:19.098
FIVE TO TEN YEARS THANK YOU VERY

03:57:20.526 --> 03:57:21.961
WHICH I THINK ARE AN IMPROVEMENT.

03:57:22.027 --> 03:57:23.195
BUT I THINK AS A COMMITTEE

03:57:23.262 --> 03:57:24.997
ANALYSIS POINTS OUT -- THERE'S

03:57:25.064 --> 03:57:27.066
FEDERAL PREEMPTION IS LOOMING --

03:57:27.132 --> 03:57:28.567
IN THE MEANTIME I THINK TO TAKE

03:57:28.634 --> 03:57:30.169
AWAY I'M ANY CONSULTING

03:57:30.235 --> 03:57:32.204
AUTHORITY FROM STATE LANDS AND

03:57:32.271 --> 03:57:33.973
MOVE IT OVER TO THE WATER BOARD.

03:57:34.039 --> 03:57:35.608
AT THIS POINT IS UNNECESSARY

03:57:35.674 --> 03:57:37.009
STATE LANCE'S BEEN.

03:57:37.076 --> 03:57:38.877
HAS BEEN WORKING ON THIS AND HAS

03:57:38.944 --> 03:57:40.813
BEEN WORKING ON THIS PROGRAM --

03:57:40.879 --> 03:57:43.182
FOR YEARS SO IT'S SEEMS A LITTLE

03:57:43.248 --> 03:57:45.284
BIT CONFUSING -- AN OUT OF ORDER

03:57:45.351 --> 03:57:46.685
AT THIS POINT I'M AND THEN OUR

03:57:46.752 --> 03:57:48.621
FINAL COMMENT IS WE HAVE

03:57:48.687 --> 03:57:50.589
CONCERNS WITH THE PROVISIONS OF

03:57:50.656 --> 03:57:51.423
REMOVING THE AUTHORITIES OUT OF

03:57:51.490 --> 03:57:53.192
THE REGIONAL WATER UALITY

03:57:53.258 --> 03:57:55.394
BOARDS TO THE STATE BOARD. FOR

03:57:55.461 --> 03:57:58.130
DISCHARGE -- INTO SENSITIVE

03:57:58.197 --> 03:57:59.965
AREAS AND PUTTING THAT THE STATE

03:58:00.032 --> 03:58:00.699
FORTY THINK IS.

03:58:00.766 --> 03:58:02.334
PERHAPS AONE SIZE FITS ALL

03:58:02.401 --> 03:58:03.936
APPROACH ON THE CANADIAN ALICE'S

03:58:04.003 --> 03:58:05.804
DOES POINT OUT THAT THERE ARE.

03:58:05.871 --> 03:58:06.972
AND THERE MAY BE SOME LAG TIME

03:58:07.039 --> 03:58:08.073
OR SOME OVERLAP IN THE

03:58:08.140 --> 03:58:09.541
DEVELOPMENT OF THE EXEMPTIONS

03:58:09.608 --> 03:58:12.444
THAT THE BILL OUTLINES OR ALLOWS

03:58:12.511 --> 03:58:14.480
FOR ON THE CREATION OF THOSE AND

03:58:14.546 --> 03:58:16.115
SO THERE THERE'S AN ISSUE IN.

03:58:16.181 --> 03:58:17.182
WHO IS?

03:58:17.249 --> 03:58:20.619
IN CHARGE OF THOSE EXCEPTIONS --

03:58:20.686 --> 03:58:21.720
DURING THAT TIME PERIOD SO WE

03:58:21.787 --> 03:58:22.755
HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT

03:58:22.821 --> 03:58:24.289
IMPLEMENTATION BUT WE HAVE HAD

03:58:24.356 --> 03:58:26.325
CONVERSATIONS WITH AUTHORS STAFF

03:58:26.392 --> 03:58:29.194
AND AND THE SPONSORS OF THE BILL

03:58:29.261 --> 03:58:29.762
IN THIS AREA AND THINK THAT

03:58:29.828 --> 03:58:30.429
PERHAPS THIS.

03:58:30.496 --> 03:58:31.497
COULD BE NARROWED A LITTLE BIT

03:58:31.563 --> 03:58:33.465
MORE -- TO ENSURE THAT IT IS

03:58:33.532 --> 03:58:36.368
LIMITED TO PUBLIC WATER AGENCIES --

03:58:36.435 --> 03:58:38.237
ARMORS ARE NOT PUBLIC WATER

03:58:38.303 --> 03:58:39.338
AGENCIES THAT ARE HOLDERS THAT

03:58:39.405 --> 03:58:41.507
AND PDS PERMITS AND SO WE'D LIKE

03:58:41.573 --> 03:58:42.641
TO CONTINUE TO WORK AND REFINED

03:58:42.708 --> 03:58:47.146
THAT ISSUE -- BUT FOR NOW WE ARE

03:58:47.212 --> 03:58:50.416
PASSED THANK YOU [inaudible]

03:58:50.482 --> 03:58:52.418
THANK YOU.

03:58:54.219 --> 03:58:56.121
COMMISSION AND WE DON'T HAVE A

03:58:56.188 --> 03:58:57.923
POSITION ON THE BILL BUT I JUST

03:58:57.990 --> 03:58:59.058
WANTED TO COMMENT ON THE BALLAST

03:58:59.124 --> 03:59:00.559
WATER PROVISIONS.

03:59:00.626 --> 03:59:01.560
AND MENTION THAT WE'VE BEEN

SO THE BILL.

03:59:39.198 --> 03:59:41.066
WHY ARE WE FIND?

03:59:41.133 --> 03:59:42.634
THE COMPETITION PLAN IN

03:59:42.701 --> 03:59:44.002
CALIFORNIA CLOSE BASS INDUSTRIES

PLAINTIFF DOCKED INCORPORATOR TO

03:59:45.304 --> 03:59:47.172
IMPROVE DENITRIFICATION

03:59:47.239 --> 03:59:47.639
PROTOCOLS [inaudible]

03:59:47.706 --> 03:59:50.242
I'M.

03:59:50.309 --> 03:59:54.012
IS IT YOUR WE SURELY.

03:59:54.079 --> 03:59:54.980
THERE OUGHT TO BE

03:59:55.047 --> 03:59:57.316
DENITRIFICATION PROTOCOLS.

03:59:57.382 --> 03:59:59.184
THAT THEY EMPLOYMENT MAYBE YOU

LETTER BUT I'M I'M JUST FILLING

04:00:12.030 --> 04:00:13.432
IN TODAY MISTER CHAIR BUT MY

04:00:13.499 --> 04:00:15.334
UNDERSTAND OUR MAJOR CONCERN IS

04:00:15.400 --> 04:00:16.201
THAT THIS THE BLANKET

04:00:16.268 --> 04:00:19.204
REQUIREMENT WHEN THEY'RE ALREADY --

04:00:19.271 --> 04:00:21.273
WERE ALREADY INVOLVED IN IN THE

04:00:21.340 --> 04:00:23.275
BAY AREA IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA --

04:00:23.342 --> 04:00:25.210
WITH THE REGIONAL BOARDS ON ON

04:00:25.277 --> 04:00:26.912
THAT TOTAL NUTRIENTS STUDIES

04:00:26.979 --> 04:00:35.788
WHICH INCLUDES A DENITRIFICATION

04:00:35.854 --> 04:00:36.188
[inaudible]

04:00:36.255 --> 04:00:40.325
YEAH.

04:00:40.392 --> 04:00:41.360
I GUESS.

04:00:41.426 --> 04:00:43.228
IF I CAN DO A FOLLOW UP.

04:00:43.295 --> 04:00:44.663
WE HAVE A LOT OF LEGACY IN --

04:00:44.730 --> 04:00:46.298
NITRIFICATION THAT EXISTS RIGHT

04:00:46.365 --> 04:00:49.935
NOW IS ARE WE DISPUTING THE

04:00:50.002 --> 04:00:52.471
CLEAN UP OF THE CURRENT LEGACY

04:00:52.538 --> 04:00:54.439
OR ASSISTED THIS NEW DISCHARGED

04:00:54.506 --> 04:00:56.975
THAT MAY BE CREATED BY ACTIVITY

04:00:57.042 --> 04:00:58.977
WITH DISTRICTS.

04:00:59.044 --> 04:01:00.479
SO WE BELIEVE THAT THE INTENT IS

04:01:00.546 --> 04:01:01.480
THAT THERE WOULD BE NEW

04:01:01.547 --> 04:01:03.248
REQUIREMENTS FOR TREATMENT AT

04:01:03.315 --> 04:01:05.017
WASTE WATER TREATMENT FACILITIES

04:01:05.083 --> 04:01:06.585
TO REMOVE NITROGEN COMPOUNDS.

04:01:06.652 --> 04:01:09.354
RIGHT NOW MOST TREATMENT PLANTS --

04:01:09.421 --> 04:01:10.589
DISCHARGING TO THE OCEAN AND I'M

04:01:10.656 --> 04:01:12.257
I WOULD ASSUME THE BAY I DON'T

04:01:12.324 --> 04:01:14.293
KNOW THAT FOR SURE -- DON'T

04:01:14.359 --> 04:01:15.761
NIGER FINDING I DEFY THEIR

04:01:15.828 --> 04:01:17.262
AFFLUENT IT -- TO ENERGY

04:01:17.329 --> 04:01:19.331
INTENSIVE EXPENSIVE PROCESS TO

04:01:19.398 --> 04:01:21.033
ADD DIRECTOR FRED INTO THE

04:01:21.099 --> 04:01:23.101
TREATMENT -- FACILITIES OFTEN

04:01:23.168 --> 04:01:24.203
YOU END UP DE RATING YOUR

04:01:24.269 --> 04:01:25.571
CAPACITY OF YOUR TREATMENT PLANT

04:01:25.637 --> 04:01:28.340
BECAUSE OF THE EXTRA TANKS THAT

04:01:28.407 --> 04:01:30.909
IT TAKES -- SO IT BECOMES A VERY

04:01:30.976 --> 04:01:32.811
EXPENSIVE PROPOSITION RIGHT NOW

04:01:32.878 --> 04:01:34.279
BECAUSE THERE ARE

04:01:34.346 --> 04:01:35.948
MODELS AND STUDIES THAT ARE

04:01:36.014 --> 04:01:39.051
GOING ON BOTH IN THE BAY AREA.

04:01:39.117 --> 04:01:40.085

COASTAL WATERS RESEARCH PROJECT

04:01:42.087 --> 04:01:44.156
THOSE ARE STILL UNDER WAY AND

04:01:44.223 --> 04:01:45.591
HAVE -- A WAYS TO GO SEVERAL

04:01:45.657 --> 04:01:47.593
YEARS AGO I BELIEVE -- WE JUST

04:01:47.659 --> 04:01:49.761
FEEL THAT THIS IS SORT OF NOT

04:01:49.828 --> 04:01:51.964
THE RED PROPIONATE -- DECIDE TO

04:01:52.030 --> 04:01:53.065
SORT OF END RUN AROUND THE

04:01:53.131 --> 04:01:54.633
SCIENCE THAT'S GOING ON RIGHT

04:01:54.700 --> 04:01:57.135
NOW TO DETERMINE WHAT NEEDS TO

04:01:57.202 --> 04:01:59.104
BE DONE.

04:01:59.171 --> 04:02:01.340
MR JUST INSTANTLY HAPPENS TO BE

04:02:01.406 --> 04:02:02.507
THE I THINK THE WASTE TREATMENT

04:02:02.574 --> 04:02:04.643
PLANTS IN OR LIMON IN.

04:02:04.710 --> 04:02:06.678

WITH SOME FANTASTIC.

04:02:12.584 --> 04:02:14.052
RESULTS AS FAR AS THE THE

04:02:14.119 --> 04:02:15.888
SUCCESS.

YEAH I'M WE HAVE SET WE HAVE A

04:02:17.222 --> 04:02:18.223
NUMBER OF TREATMENT PLANTS THAT

04:02:18.290 --> 04:02:19.591
DO NOT TO FIND THE NINETY FIVE

04:02:19.658 --> 04:02:21.093
THOSE ARE OUR WATER RECLAMATION

04:02:21.159 --> 04:02:22.494
PLANS ARE OCEAN DISCHARGE PLANT

04:02:22.561 --> 04:02:24.263
DOES NOT IT'S A BIG UNDERTAKING

04:02:24.329 --> 04:02:26.098
I DON'T HAVE A A COST ESTIMATE

04:02:26.164 --> 04:02:27.199
AT THIS TIME OF HOW MUCH IT

04:02:27.266 --> 04:02:27.399
WOULD.

INVOLVED IN THIS IN THE MODELING

04:02:31.970 --> 04:02:33.338
AND STUDIES GOING ON WE ARE

04:02:33.405 --> 04:02:35.040
LOOKING AT IT BUT IT'S IT'S IT

04:02:35.107 --> 04:02:36.775
JUST SEEMS PREMATURE TO US AT

04:02:36.842 --> 04:02:38.710

THAT DIRECTION OF SETTING A

04:05:09.961 --> 04:05:11.229
WATER QUALITY OBJECTIVE.

04:05:11.296 --> 04:05:12.330
THAT WE DON'T HAVE THESE AWAY

04:05:12.397 --> 04:05:13.732
HOT SPOTS AND THEY DO WANT TO

04:05:13.799 --> 04:05:14.933
WAIT UNTIL THE SCIENCES THERE

04:05:15.000 --> 04:05:16.735
WHICH THEY THINK IS GOING TO BE.

04:05:16.802 --> 04:05:18.270
THE PRELIMINARY FINDINGS ALREADY

04:05:18.336 --> 04:05:18.904
COMING OUT THERE ALREADY IN

04:05:18.970 --> 04:05:21.339
TALKS -- AND WE ARE TALKING WITH

04:05:30.816 --> 04:05:31.983
OF GET AHEAD OF ITSELF AND SET

04:05:32.050 --> 04:05:33.485
SOME WATER QUALITY OBJECTIVE

04:05:33.552 --> 04:05:34.853
THAT'S NOT SCIENTIFICALLY AND

04:05:34.920 --> 04:05:36.721
LEGALLY DEFENSIBLE.

04:05:36.788 --> 04:05:38.023
I WORK AT THE STATE WATER BOARD

04:05:38.090 --> 04:05:39.324

SIDE PANELS. TO INFORM WHAT THIS

04:05:52.537 --> 04:05:54.072
WATER QUALITY OBJECTIVE IS.

04:05:54.139 --> 04:05:55.841
THIS ONLY JUST SETS THE TRIGGER

04:05:55.907 --> 04:05:57.342
TO GET THE STATE WATER BOARD TO

04:05:57.409 --> 04:05:58.310
MOVE FOR WITH THAT AND AGAIN

04:05:58.376 --> 04:05:59.444

04:06:03.248 --> 04:06:03.849
SO THAT THEY DON'T GET AHEAD OF

04:06:03.915 --> 04:06:04.816
THE SITES THAT.

04:06:04.883 --> 04:06:06.485
IT MAYBE THE STATE FOR NEED TO

04:06:06.551 --> 04:06:08.153
PUT A FINDING IN OF OKAY THE THE

04:06:08.220 --> 04:06:09.454
SCIENCE DOES JUSTIFY THESE HOT

04:06:09.521 --> 04:06:13.758
SPOTS ARE CURRENT WE'RE GOING TO

04:06:13.825 --> 04:06:15.327
MOVE FORWARD.

JUST THE DEAN EDUCATION PIECE.

04:06:18.864 --> 04:06:20.265
THE INTENT OF THE BILL IS REALLY

04:06:20.332 --> 04:06:21.700
FOR THE WASTEWATER FACILITIES TO

04:06:21.766 --> 04:06:23.401
MEET THE WATER QUALITY OBJECTIVE

04:06:23.468 --> 04:06:24.736
THAT THE STATE BOARD SETS WE

04:06:24.803 --> 04:06:26.304
DON'T WANNA BE PRESCRIPTIVE AND

04:06:26.371 --> 04:06:28.306
SAY IT HAS TO BE THIS ONE WAY.

04:06:28.373 --> 04:06:29.074
OR THE WAY I READ THE LANGUAGE

04:06:29.141 --> 04:06:30.509
IT'S NOT PRESCRIPTIVE THE ONE

04:06:30.575 --> 04:06:32.544

EDUCATION LOOK AT WETLANDS

04:06:39.651 --> 04:06:41.620
LOOKING RECYCLED WATER WE WE

04:06:41.686 --> 04:06:42.721
THINK THE BILL HAS THE

04:06:42.787 --> 04:06:43.889
FLEXIBILITY IN THERE NOW.

04:06:43.955 --> 04:06:46.057
WE'RE HAPPY TO TAKE A FURTHER

04:06:46.124 --> 04:06:47.159
LANGUAGE THAT THAT ADDRESSES

04:06:47.225 --> 04:06:47.459
THAT.

04:06:47.526 --> 04:06:49.194
WE'VE BEEN TINKERING WITH AN

04:06:49.261 --> 04:06:50.195
AMENDMENT TO TO REQUIRE THE

04:06:50.262 --> 04:06:51.496
STATE BOARD TO CONSIDER REGIONAL

04:06:51.563 --> 04:06:53.765
BOARD APPROACHES WHEN THEY'RE

04:06:53.832 --> 04:06:55.200
DOING THEIR IMPLEMENTATION PLAN.

04:06:55.267 --> 04:06:56.268
WHEN WHEN THE SEA PORTS THAT'S A

04:06:56.334 --> 04:06:57.169
WATER QUALITY OBJECTIVE THAT

04:06:57.235 --> 04:06:58.203
WILL SET THE OBJECTIVE BUT

04:06:58.270 --> 04:06:59.804
THERE'S AN IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

04:06:59.871 --> 04:07:00.839
THAT GOES WITH THAT AND THAT'S

04:07:00.906 --> 04:07:01.673
REALLY THE HEART OF IT AND THE

04:07:01.740 --> 04:07:02.507
MEAT OF IT?

04:07:02.574 --> 04:07:03.542

04:07:03.608 --> 04:07:05.310
HAVE THE DISCRETION TO LOOK AT

04:07:05.377 --> 04:07:06.244
OTHER REGIONS AND WHAT'S BEEN

04:07:06.311 --> 04:07:07.746
GOING ON INCOMPETENT

04:07:07.812 --> 04:07:10.148
IMPLEMENTATION PLAN THAT WORKS

04:07:10.215 --> 04:07:11.249
TO MEET THAT WATER.

04:07:11.316 --> 04:07:14.085

CATACLYSMIC FIRES.

04:09:01.860 --> 04:09:04.195
NOT JUST LAST YEAR ALTHOUGH THAT

04:09:04.262 --> 04:09:06.931
WAS PROBABLY AT A PEAK YEAR.

04:09:06.998 --> 04:09:08.800

THESE FIRES.

04:09:12.570 --> 04:09:15.273
I HAVE A DEVASTATING IMPACT ON

04:09:15.340 --> 04:09:17.275
OUR WATERSHEDS.

04:09:17.342 --> 04:09:20.078
IN TERMS OF THE CAPACITY OF

04:09:20.145 --> 04:09:22.447
THOSE WATERSHEDS TO RETAIN.

04:09:22.514 --> 04:09:23.448
THE STORE WATER.

04:09:23.515 --> 04:09:25.550

WATERWAYS.

04:09:46.738 --> 04:09:48.740
SOMETIMES THESE FIRES REACH SUCH

04:09:48.807 --> 04:09:51.943
A TEMPERATURE THAT THE ROUND IS

04:09:52.010 --> 04:09:53.478
LITERALLY STERILIZED FOR A

04:09:53.545 --> 04:09:55.013

04:09:55.080 --> 04:09:57.882
BEFORE ANYTHING COMES BACK.

04:09:57.949 --> 04:10:00.318
IT TAKES A SUSTAINED EFFORT. TO

04:10:00.385 --> 04:10:02.987
BRING THEM BACK.

04:10:03.054 --> 04:10:05.323
DIVIDE THE HABITAT [inaudible]

SO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO.

04:10:23.074 --> 04:10:25.577
WITH THIS MEASURE.

04:10:25.643 --> 04:10:29.381
IS TO CREATE A GRANT PROGRAM.

MANNER IN WHICH THEY BEEN ABLE

04:38:51.247 --> 04:38:52.282
SECRET -- FOR THE LAST ONE

04:38:52.348 --> 04:38:54.684
HUNDRED YEARS CONSIDER IF THAT

OPPORTUNITIES FOR COUNTERFEIT IF

04:38:58.054 --> 04:39:01.091
IT WERE MADE PUBLIC -- THAT IS

04:39:01.157 --> 04:39:02.459
PRECISELY THE CONCERN HERE AND I

04:39:02.525 --> 04:39:04.160
THINK THAT THE PUBLIC POLICY

04:39:04.227 --> 04:39:06.196
QUESTION THAT WE NEED A WAY HERE.

04:39:06.262 --> 04:39:08.431
IS BALANCING A CONSUMERS RIGHT

04:39:08.498 --> 04:39:10.133
TO KNOW WITH BALANCING A

04:39:10.200 --> 04:39:12.368
COMPANIES RIGHT TO PRESERVE ITS

COMPETITIVE WITH RESPECT TO ITS

04:39:15.071 --> 04:39:17.040
PRODUCTS.

04:39:17.107 --> 04:39:18.174
I'M WE'VE HEARD A LITTLE BIT

04:39:18.241 --> 04:39:19.642
ABOUT THE CLEANING PRODUCTS

04:39:19.709 --> 04:39:20.777
RIGHT TO KNOW ACT WHICH WAS

04:39:20.844 --> 04:39:21.911
PASSED LAST YEAR BY THIS BODY

04:39:21.978 --> 04:39:24.147
AND IT'S BEEN REFERENCE MANY

04:39:24.214 --> 04:39:26.416
TIMES WITH RESPECT TO THIS BILL --

04:39:26.483 --> 04:39:27.717
IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO

04:39:27.784 --> 04:39:29.052
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT CLEANING

04:39:29.119 --> 04:39:30.186
PRODUCTS ARE DIFFERENT THAN

04:39:30.253 --> 04:39:31.387
BEAUTY AND PERSONAL CARE

04:39:31.454 --> 04:39:32.755
PRODUCTS WHICH ARE DIFFERENT

04:39:32.822 --> 04:39:34.624
THAN FIND FRAGRANCES.

04:39:34.691 --> 04:39:35.258
AND SO I THINK THAT THOUGHT OF

04:39:35.325 --> 04:39:36.626
KNOWLEDGE MINT IS VERY IMPORTANT

04:39:36.693 --> 04:39:38.128
AS YOU LOOK AT THIS BILL AND

04:39:38.194 --> 04:39:39.996
THINK THROUGH THAT FRAME.

04:39:40.063 --> 04:39:41.498
I WITH ALL THAT SAID OUR

04:39:41.564 --> 04:39:43.433
INDUSTRY IS VERY PROGRESSIVE

04:39:43.500 --> 04:39:44.701
WITH RESPECT TO DISCLOSURE WE'VE

04:39:44.768 --> 04:39:46.436
BEEN DISCLOSING OUR INGREDIENTS

04:39:46.503 --> 04:39:47.604
IN OUR PRODUCTS SINCE THE

04:39:47.670 --> 04:39:50.540
NINETEEN SEVENTIES -- AND I

04:39:50.607 --> 04:39:52.342
THINK THERE IS A PATH TO THIS

04:39:52.408 --> 04:39:53.843
BILL AND I THINK I FEEL LIKE

04:39:53.910 --> 04:39:56.679
WE'RE CLOSE -- WITH ALL THAT

04:39:56.746 --> 04:39:57.614
SAID I DO WANT TO RUN THROUGH

04:39:57.680 --> 04:39:59.616
VERY QUICKLY ARE REMAINING

04:39:59.682 --> 04:40:02.051
CONCERNS WITH THE BILL -- WE

04:40:02.118 --> 04:40:03.720
WOULD LIKE TO SEE OVER THE

04:40:03.786 --> 04:40:05.889
COUNTER COSMETICS EXEMPTED FROM

04:40:05.955 --> 04:40:07.457
THE BILL IN PART BECAUSE AS IT

04:40:07.524 --> 04:40:09.993
KNOWLEDGE BY THE SUPPORTERS IT

04:40:10.059 --> 04:40:11.594
IS REGULATED BY THE FDA.

04:40:11.661 --> 04:40:13.763
VERY RIGOROUSLY REGULATED BY THE

04:40:13.830 --> 04:40:14.998
FDA SO WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE --

04:40:15.064 --> 04:40:18.935
TC'S TAKEN OUT FROM THE BILL --

04:40:19.002 --> 04:40:21.271
AND BECAUSE THIS BILL REQUIRES

04:40:21.337 --> 04:40:22.305
DISCLOSURE TO THE DEPARTMENT OF

04:40:22.372 --> 04:40:24.474

ON THE DECK DPH WEBSITE WHICH I

04:40:35.919 --> 04:40:37.620
THINK IS AN AGREEABLE THING

04:40:37.687 --> 04:40:39.322
BASED ON OUR CONVERSATIONS.

04:40:39.389 --> 04:40:41.057
BUT IT'S IMPORTANT FOR COMPANIES

04:40:41.124 --> 04:40:42.592
ESPECIALLY THE SMALL AND MEDIUM

04:40:42.659 --> 04:40:44.027
SIZE COMPANIES TO BE ABLE TO

04:40:44.093 --> 04:40:46.329
KEEP UP WITH THOSE LESS AS

BE THE STATEWIDE POLICY.

04:41:00.510 --> 04:41:01.511
AND ALONG THOSE LINES WOULD

AGAIN AT SOME POINT YOU GET TO A

04:47:36.272 --> 04:47:38.074
POINT WHERE YOU HAVE TO HOLD ON

OF OTC PRODUCTS -- WHAT THAT

04:47:51.253 --> 04:47:53.589
REFERS TO OUR COSMETIC PRODUCTS

04:47:53.656 --> 04:47:54.991
THAT MAKE A MEDICAL CLAIM WE

04:47:55.057 --> 04:47:56.459
THINK OF THEM AS BECAUSE MASUDA

04:47:56.525 --> 04:47:58.327
COLES AND THEY ARE REGULATED

04:47:58.394 --> 04:48:00.596
DIFFERENTLY BY THE FDA -- AND

04:48:00.663 --> 04:48:02.164
THEY INCLUDE THINGS LIKE ANTI

04:48:02.231 --> 04:48:05.835
PERSPIRANT SUNSCREENS --

04:48:05.901 --> 04:48:08.137

CLAIM.

04:48:11.941 --> 04:48:13.609
IS REGULATED DIFFERENTLY BY THE

04:48:13.676 --> 04:48:15.845
FDA BUT BUT TWO THINGS ONE THIS

04:48:15.911 --> 04:48:17.647

ABOUT DISCLOSURE.

04:48:19.215 --> 04:48:21.117
SO THAT PART IS IRRELEVANT AND

04:48:21.183 --> 04:48:22.918
THE OTHER PART IS THAT THE SAFE

04:48:22.985 --> 04:48:24.654
COSMETICS PROGRAM IN CONSUMERS

04:48:24.720 --> 04:48:26.155
DON'T DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN

04:48:26.222 --> 04:48:28.357
KOSMOS ARTICLES AND COSMETICS

04:48:28.424 --> 04:48:28.891
CURRENTLY.

04:48:28.958 --> 04:48:30.326
BECAUSE MISTER NICHOLS ARE BEING

MISTER NICHOLS CURRENTLY IN THE

04:48:38.768 --> 04:48:40.503
SAFE COSMETICS DATABASE AND

04:48:40.569 --> 04:48:41.871
CONSUMERS.

04:48:41.937 --> 04:48:43.105
IF THEY'RE USING AN ANTI

04:48:43.172 --> 04:48:44.640
PERSPIRANT OR DEODORANT THEY

04:48:44.707 --> 04:48:46.409
DON'T KNOW THAT ONE IS AN OTC

04:48:46.475 --> 04:48:48.044
REGULATED PRODUCT AND THE OTHER

04:48:48.110 --> 04:48:48.844
IS SO.

04:48:48.911 --> 04:48:51.714

THE BILL I SAID YOU KNOW I SAID.

04:50:46.061 --> 04:50:47.830
PART OF THE REASON IS BECAUSE

WHEN I WAS ELECTED IN TWO

04:50:50.032 --> 04:50:50.599

04:54:28.017 --> 04:54:29.084
THE STATE I THINK THERE'S

04:54:29.151 --> 04:54:30.986
ACTUALLY A LOT MORE CONCERNED.

04:54:31.053 --> 04:54:32.321
ABOUT HOW CLOSE THEY ARE TO

04:54:32.388 --> 04:54:34.490
COMMUNITIES BUT I'VE I FIGURED

04:54:34.556 --> 04:54:35.524
WE SHOULD AT LEAST STARTWITH

04:54:35.591 --> 04:54:36.625

THROUGH A SERIES OF REFORMS BUT

04:57:06.375 --> 04:57:08.310
HOW SOLID THEY'LL BE -- REMAINS

04:57:08.377 --> 04:57:09.912
TO BE SEEN THEY'RE NOT A PUBLIC

04:57:09.978 --> 04:57:11.847
HEALTH AGENCY BY DESIGN SO.

04:57:11.914 --> 04:57:12.681

04:57:12.748 --> 04:57:15.150
JOB DURING THE LEAK I DON'T KNOW.

04:57:15.217 --> 04:57:18.253
WHEN WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT THE --

04:57:18.320 --> 04:57:20.322
REPORTING ON THE CHEMICALS AND

04:57:20.389 --> 04:57:22.791
ENHANCE.

04:57:22.858 --> 04:57:25.294
UNDER ENHANCE RECOVERY IN OIL

04:57:25.360 --> 04:57:26.728
YOU YOU KNOW WHAT YOUR CHEMICALS

04:57:26.795 --> 04:57:28.163
ARE VIEW YOU COULD YOU CREATE

04:57:28.230 --> 04:57:29.865
THEM YOU PUT THE MEN.

04:57:29.932 --> 04:57:32.467
THEN YOU WHEN YOU PRODUCE THE

04:57:32.534 --> 04:57:34.136
OIL YOU PULL THEM OUT AND YOU

04:57:34.203 --> 04:57:37.005
HAVE YOU HAVE THAT LEFTOVERS AND

04:57:37.072 --> 04:57:39.241
YOU CAN DO THE ANALYSIS.

04:57:39.308 --> 04:57:41.043
HOW IF YOU PUT THE?

04:57:41.109 --> 04:57:42.778
ENHANCE CHEMICALS IN WITH THE

04:57:42.844 --> 04:57:43.946
NATURAL GAS YOU SHOULD KNOW WHO

04:57:44.012 --> 04:57:45.380
THEY ARE WHAT THEY ARE BUT IF IT

04:57:45.447 --> 04:57:47.549
LEAKS OUT HOW WOULD YOU KNOW

04:57:47.616 --> 04:57:53.522
WHAT THAT WAS -- BECAUSE YOU'RE

04:57:53.589 --> 04:57:55.857
SOME NATURAL OCCURRING CANNELLA

04:57:55.924 --> 04:57:58.360
EVERYBODY AGREES WITH THAT.

04:57:58.427 --> 04:58:00.162
THIS S AN EMPTY OIL FIELD -- SO

04:58:00.229 --> 04:58:01.697
THERE'S THERE'S LEFTOVER DEPOSIT

04:58:01.763 --> 04:58:03.565
THAT MIGHT BE DISTINGUISHED FROM

04:58:03.632 --> 04:58:07.269
THE CHEMICALS THEY USED ACTUALLY.

04:58:07.336 --> 04:58:07.736
BRAK.

04:58:07.803 --> 04:58:10.205
FOR RAIN OR EXTRACT -- SO I

04:58:10.272 --> 04:58:11.039
GUESS YOU'D HAVE TO DO SOME KIND

04:58:11.106 --> 04:58:13.175
OF DEDUCTION BASED ON WHAT THE

04:58:13.242 --> 04:58:14.309

I CANNOT PROMISE -- ANY DIVINE

PURCHASE AND CONSUME MANY GOODS

05:00:33.048 --> 05:00:34.149
HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

05:00:34.216 --> 05:00:35.751
THROUGH PROCUREMENT WE CURRENTLY

05:00:35.817 --> 05:00:37.386
HAVE A ANNUAL STATE AGENCY

05:00:37.452 --> 05:00:39.221
GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION REPORT

05:00:39.287 --> 05:00:40.088
CARD.

05:00:40.155 --> 05:00:41.089
THAT WE THINK IT'S BEEN REALLY

05:00:41.156 --> 05:00:43.358
EFFECTIVE FOR TRACKING HOW

05:00:43.425 --> 05:00:44.526
AGENCIES.

05:00:44.593 --> 05:00:46.128
OUR STATE AGENCIES ARE ARE

05:00:46.194 --> 05:00:47.162
UNDERTAKEN THEIR CLIMATE

05:00:47.229 --> 05:00:48.897
COMMITMENTS FOR INSTANCE -- THE

05:00:48.964 --> 05:00:50.599
LIGHTING IN THIS BUILDING OR THE

05:00:50.665 --> 05:00:52.601
COMMUTES BEING UNDERTAKEN BY

05:00:52.667 --> 05:00:54.369
STATE EMPLOYEES OR WHAT KIND OF

05:00:54.436 --> 05:00:57.239
POWER SOURCES WERE RELYING ON OR

05:00:57.305 --> 05:01:00.342
THE THE USE OF SAY PAPER OR

05:01:00.409 --> 05:01:02.744
COMPOSTABLE MATERIALS FOR THE

05:01:02.811 --> 05:01:05.380
FOOD SYSTEMS THAT YOU'VE LEAD ON

05:01:05.447 --> 05:01:06.415
THIS ISSUE MISTER CHAIR IN THE

05:01:06.481 --> 05:01:08.483
PAST -- WERE SAYING HERE THAT

05:01:08.550 --> 05:01:10.218
THEY SHOULD ALSO APPLY TO THE TO

05:01:10.285 --> 05:01:11.386
THE FOOD BEING PURCHASED BY THE

05:01:11.453 --> 05:01:12.387
STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND WE THINK

05:01:12.454 --> 05:01:13.388
IT'S IT COULD ACTUALLY BE A

05:01:13.455 --> 05:01:16.224
REALLY EXCITING OPPORTUNITY NOT

05:01:16.291 --> 05:01:17.359
JUST. FOR FOR THOSE WHO CARE

05:01:17.426 --> 05:01:18.760
ABOUT THE CARBON FOOTPRINT OF

05:01:18.827 --> 05:01:20.228
WHAT WE'RE CONSUMING THE STATE

05:01:20.295 --> 05:01:23.265
BUT ALSO -- FOR IN STATE --

05:01:23.331 --> 05:01:26.835
GROWERS OF OF FOOD WE THINK THAT.

05:01:26.902 --> 05:01:28.270
UNDERSTANDING BETTER THE CARBON

05:01:28.336 --> 05:01:29.371
FOOTPRINT OF THE FOOD SYSTEM

05:01:29.438 --> 05:01:31.973
THAT THE STATE'S PROCURING FROM

05:01:32.040 --> 05:01:34.142
COULD ACTUALLY GIVE -- SOME

05:01:34.209 --> 05:01:35.644
VALUE TO THE AGRICULTURAL

05:01:35.710 --> 05:01:37.145
COMMUNITY BECAUSE AS WE KNOW

05:01:37.212 --> 05:01:39.815
CALIFORNIA'S I COMMUNITY IS THE

05:01:39.881 --> 05:01:42.484
MOST ADVANCED I WOULD SAY IN THE

05:01:42.551 --> 05:01:43.919
NATION IF NOT THE WORLD.

05:01:43.985 --> 05:01:45.287
THE EFFICIENCIES WERE ASKING

05:01:45.353 --> 05:01:48.723
THEM TO UNDERGO GREENHOUSE GAS.

05:01:48.790 --> 05:01:50.192
REDUCTION TECHNIQUES UNDERGOING

05:01:50.258 --> 05:01:51.693
IN HEALTHY SOILS ALTERNATE MANY

05:01:51.760 --> 05:01:53.395
OR MANAGEMENT ALL KINDS OF

05:01:53.462 --> 05:01:54.463
SECTOR SO WE ACTUALLY TINK

05:01:54.529 --> 05:01:55.931
THERE'S AN INTERESTING WHEN WHEN

05:01:55.997 --> 05:01:56.898
TO BE HAD HERE BUT THIS IS A

05:01:56.965 --> 05:01:58.533
MODEST START THAT WOULD EXPAND

05:01:58.600 --> 05:01:59.601
THAT INVENTORY TO APPLY THE FOOD

05:01:59.668 --> 05:02:01.636
SECTOR SO THAT'S THE LONG AND

05:02:01.703 --> 05:02:04.139
SHORT OF IT -- SO WITH THAT

05:02:04.206 --> 05:02:05.807

A REAL REALLY DEBILITATING

05:16:05.446 --> 05:16:07.415
IMPACT ON CONSUMERS I'M ONE OF

05:16:07.481 --> 05:16:08.883
THOSE CONSUMERS WHO HAS DRIVEN

05:16:08.949 --> 05:16:11.152
AROUND MY LOCAL CITY LOOKING FOR

RECYCLING CENTERS.

05:16:12.453 --> 05:16:14.288
AND CAN SPEAK TO THE FRUSTRATION.

05:16:14.355 --> 05:16:15.690
IT CAN BE DIFFICULT TO FIND A

05:16:15.756 --> 05:16:17.558
WAY TO GET YOUR MONEY BACK AND

05:16:17.625 --> 05:16:19.293
WITHOUT CONVENIENT COLLECTION OR

05:16:19.360 --> 05:16:20.895

BOTTLE BILL OFTEN BECOMES A

05:16:22.563 --> 05:16:23.631
REGRESSIVE TAX.

IT'S IN NO ONE'S BEST INTEREST

05:16:25.266 --> 05:16:27.768
SO WE REALLY SUPPORT THIS BILL

05:16:27.835 --> 05:16:29.470

PREVENT MORE FROM CLOSING.

05:16:34.208 --> 05:16:35.810

WE'RE GONNA KEEP.

AROUND THE MAJOR SUPERMARKET

05:20:18.098 --> 05:20:19.166
JUST WHEN RECYCLING CENTERS ARE

05:20:19.233 --> 05:20:21.468
AN ECONOMIC CRISIS AND 40% OF

MORE ON THE WAY OUT -- THE

05:20:36.750 --> 05:20:38.419
PRIMARY REASON IS BECAUSE THE

05:20:38.485 --> 05:20:40.220
STATE RECYCLING SYSTEM LEAVES

05:20:40.287 --> 05:20:42.256

CALIFORNIA.

05:21:02.710 --> 05:21:04.311

05:21:04.378 --> 05:21:05.879
NORTHERN CALIFORNIA COUNTIES OF

OF THE CONVENIENCE ZONES.

05:21:25.232 --> 05:21:28.636
SO AS TO THE ENFORCEMENT ISSUE.

05:21:28.702 --> 05:21:30.270
LET'S JUST GIVE ONE EXAMPLE.

05:21:30.337 --> 05:21:32.172

AND THAT'S IT LOTS IT'S A GREAT

05:22:44.912 --> 05:22:45.446
IDEA AND IT.

ANYWHERE.

05:22:51.752 --> 05:22:54.221
WHATEVER THAT'S GOING TO BE.

05:22:54.288 --> 05:22:57.391
THAT'S THE LONG TERM APPROACH

05:22:57.458 --> 05:22:58.325
THAT SENATOR STERN MASSES HOW

SO WE WILL -- WE LIKE A SHORT

05:23:04.565 --> 05:23:05.966
TERM FIX TO GO THROUGH.

05:23:06.033 --> 05:23:06.700
WE WOULD LIKE IT TO BE

05:23:06.767 --> 05:23:09.303
CONSIDERED AND WE LOOK FORWARD --

05:23:09.369 --> 05:23:11.872
TO HAVING A COMPLETE OVERHAUL OF

05:23:11.939 --> 05:23:13.273
OUR RECYCLING SYSTEM BY THE

05:23:13.340 --> 05:23:15.676
LEGISLATOR AND LEGISLATURE AND

05:23:15.743 --> 05:23:17.978
THE ADMINISTRATION ASK INVOLVED

05:23:18.045 --> 05:23:18.846
TOO SO.

05:23:18.912 --> 05:23:19.113
THAT'S IT.

05:23:19.179 --> 05:23:20.714
THANK YOU.

05:23:20.781 --> 05:23:22.282
OTHERS IN OPPOSITION MY NAME IS

05:23:22.349 --> 05:23:23.517
LEONARD LYING I'M FROM ORANGE

05:23:23.584 --> 05:23:25.219
COUNTY AND I'VE CONSULTED WITH --

05:23:25.285 --> 05:23:27.354
RECYCLERS FOR YEARS I'VE BEEN IN

05:23:27.421 --> 05:23:28.489
THE PROGRAM SINCE THE BEGINNING.

05:23:28.555 --> 05:23:29.523
I AM AN EXPERT [inaudible]

05:23:29.590 --> 05:23:31.458
UP.

05:23:31.525 --> 05:23:33.026
I'M HERE BECAUSE THERE ARE

05:23:33.093 --> 05:23:35.229
SERIOUS ERRORS OF FACT IN.

05:23:35.295 --> 05:23:36.396
BOTH THE CONSUMER WATCHDOG

05:23:36.463 --> 05:23:37.998
REPORT.

05:23:38.065 --> 05:23:39.833
AND IN THE ANALYSIS FOR THIS

05:23:39.900 --> 05:23:40.968
BILL AND I THINK IF THOSE WERE

05:23:41.034 --> 05:23:42.936
CLARIFIED WE COME UP WITH MUCH

05:23:43.003 --> 05:23:44.538
BETTER BILL I AM OPPOSED TO THE

05:23:44.605 --> 05:23:45.906
BILL UNLESS AMENDED.

05:23:45.973 --> 05:23:47.941
AND I'VE SUBMITTED A SIGNIFICANT

05:23:48.008 --> 05:23:50.110
NUMBER OF AMENDMENTS TO FIX THIS

05:23:50.177 --> 05:23:50.844
PROGRAM.

05:23:50.911 --> 05:23:52.746
THE KEY IS THE CLOSURES ARE

05:23:52.813 --> 05:23:55.182
BASED UPON ONE COMPANY CLOSING

05:23:55.249 --> 05:23:57.284
HUNDREDS.

05:23:57.351 --> 05:23:59.253
THE NEXT ISSUE OF CLOSURES ARE

05:23:59.319 --> 05:24:02.256
REVOCATIONS BY CAL RECYCLE SUCH

05:24:02.322 --> 05:24:05.159
AS IN AMADOR COUNTY RECENTLY

05:24:05.225 --> 05:24:06.960
FORTUNATELY THAT WE FIX THAT --

05:24:07.027 --> 05:24:09.830
THEY WANTED TO REMOVE ONE OF

05:24:09.897 --> 05:24:10.397
THREE RECYCLERS WITHIN THE

05:24:10.464 --> 05:24:11.765
COUNTY.

05:24:11.832 --> 05:24:13.066
OF THE NEXT IS.

05:24:13.133 --> 05:24:14.334
CALORIE CYCLE HAS DENIED

05:24:14.401 --> 05:24:17.704
APPLICATIONS TO REFILL THESE ON

05:24:17.771 --> 05:24:19.273
AND THEN CITIES HAVE BEEN

05:24:19.339 --> 05:24:21.275
WORKING AGAINST RECYCLING. TO

05:24:21.341 --> 05:24:22.643
REMOVE RECYCLERS BECAUSE OF

05:24:22.709 --> 05:24:23.944
HOMELESS ISSUES.

05:24:24.011 --> 05:24:26.113
THE REAL QUESTION HERE IS HOW

05:24:26.180 --> 05:24:28.148
MANY UNSUBSIDIZED RECYCLERS HAVE

05:24:28.215 --> 05:24:29.616
GONE OUT OF BUSINESS THAT'S THE

05:24:29.683 --> 05:24:31.451
NUMBER YOU NEED TO KNOW AND THIS

05:24:31.518 --> 05:24:32.252
BILL DOESN'T DO ANYTHING TO HELP

05:24:32.319 --> 05:24:40.627
THEM.

05:26:35.509 --> 05:26:37.044
TO SENATOR WHITE HOUSE HE'S AN

05:26:37.110 --> 05:26:38.912
IMMEDIATE AND APPLAUD HIS GREAT

05:26:38.979 --> 05:26:41.148
EFFORTS -- AND THE STRUGGLES

THAT THE TO DEAL WITH THIS THIS

05:26:42.349 --> 05:26:44.618
IS ONGOING PROBLEM AND I

05:26:46.453 --> 05:26:48.422
WILLINGNESS TO TAKE IT ON I DO I

05:26:48.488 --> 05:26:49.957
RECOGNIZE SOME OF THE CONCERNS

05:26:50.023 --> 05:26:51.959
THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED IN AND I

05:26:52.025 --> 05:26:52.492
THINK IS.

05:26:52.559 --> 05:26:55.228
pWOULD BE NICE TO HAVE A FIX THAT

05:26:55.295 --> 05:26:57.664
WE CAN DEPEND ON RELY ON AND

05:26:57.731 --> 05:26:59.266
MOVE FORWARD WITH -- I I DON'T

05:26:59.333 --> 05:27:01.201
KNOW IF.

05:27:01.268 --> 05:27:03.136
THIS IS WILL GET US THERE IN

05:27:03.203 --> 05:27:05.739
THIS SHORT TIME FRAME SO I HOPE.

05:27:05.806 --> 05:27:07.140
THAT IS BECAUSE TO ME YOU COULD

05:27:07.207 --> 05:27:09.276

BUT HOPEFULLY YOU CAN KIND OF

05:27:16.283 --> 05:27:16.984
WORK ON SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT

05:27:17.050 --> 05:27:18.752
WERE RAISED -- BECAUSE I THINK

05:27:18.819 --> 05:27:20.687
THAT COULD BE IMPORTANT IN

05:27:20.754 --> 05:27:23.156
GETTING US TO THAT [inaudible]

05:27:23.223 --> 05:27:26.293

ALLEN ON PLASTICS.

05:27:52.185 --> 05:27:53.153
FIRST 50% SO.

05:27:53.220 --> 05:27:55.322
I'M YOU KNOW I'M A LITTLE -- OUT

05:27:55.389 --> 05:27:57.090
RANKED HERE IN TERMS OF

05:27:57.157 --> 05:27:59.259
EXPERTISE BETWEEN.

05:27:59.326 --> 05:28:01.261
THE CENTER Y. CASKEY.

05:28:01.328 --> 05:28:03.463
BUT I'LL JUST COMMIT MYSELF TO

05:28:03.530 --> 05:28:05.932
DOING THAT WORK AND NOT JUST TRY

05:28:05.999 --> 05:28:07.334
TO SAY A BANDAIDS GONNA SELL

05:28:07.401 --> 05:28:08.902
BECAUSE I I REALLY THE THIS

05:28:08.969 --> 05:28:11.004
ISN'T THE TOTAL ANSWER WE'VE GOT

05:28:11.071 --> 05:28:11.972
TO GET THROUGH THE NEXT COUPLE

05:28:12.039 --> 05:28:13.940
YEARS THOUGH OR AT LEAST THIS

05:28:14.007 --> 05:28:14.141
YEAR.

05:28:14.207 --> 05:28:16.209
AND TRY TO FIND SOME NEAR TERM

05:28:16.276 --> 05:28:17.911
WAY TO DEAL WITH NATIONAL STORED

05:28:17.978 --> 05:28:19.479
RE STIMULATE THE MARKET IN SOME

05:28:19.546 --> 05:28:21.948
MEANINGFUL WAY BUT I DON'T WANT

05:28:22.015 --> 05:28:23.183
TO GET IN THE WAY THAT BIGGER

05:28:23.250 --> 05:28:24.551
PROGRESS IN FACT AYE AYE SIR TO

I'M.

05:28:35.395 --> 05:28:36.396
THE INTERESTING THING IS THE

05:28:36.463 --> 05:28:37.664
VETO MESSAGE ON GLAZERS BILL

05:28:37.731 --> 05:28:39.466
WHICH WAS VERY COMPARABLE TO

05:28:39.533 --> 05:28:43.136
THIS LAST YEAR HAD TO DO WITH.

05:28:43.203 --> 05:28:45.272
THE PROBLEM OF THE BUDGET.

05:28:45.338 --> 05:28:49.509
MEANING THE IN OUR ACCOUNTS OR

05:28:49.576 --> 05:28:50.677
OUR RESOURCE FUND IS AN

05:28:50.744 --> 05:28:52.312
ADEQUATELY FUNDED.

05:28:52.379 --> 05:28:53.246
BUT IN FACT.

05:28:53.313 --> 05:28:57.250
THE ONE OF THE ISSUES IN YOUR

05:28:57.317 --> 05:29:00.187
FINDINGS ARE YOUR ARGUMENTS --

05:29:00.253 --> 05:29:01.188
DESCRIBED AS ONE OF THE ISSUES

05:29:01.254 --> 05:29:04.558
IS THAT WITH THE COLLAPSE OF THE

05:29:04.624 --> 05:29:06.726
COLLAPSE WITH HE UNWILLINGNESS

05:29:06.793 --> 05:29:09.029
OF COUNTRIES IN ASIA TO BUY WHAT

05:29:09.096 --> 05:29:10.497
WE NO LONGER CONSIDER VALUABLE.

05:29:10.564 --> 05:29:12.265
WHICH IS OUR WHOLE RECYCLING

05:29:12.332 --> 05:29:14.267
PROGRAM WAS BASED ON THEIR

05:29:14.334 --> 05:29:16.036
BUYING OUR JUNK.

05:29:16.103 --> 05:29:17.804
AND I NOW THAT THEY PRODUCE

05:29:17.871 --> 05:29:19.473
THEIR OWN BECAUSE EVERYBODY

05:29:19.539 --> 05:29:20.841
TALKS NATIONALS WORK BUT RIGHT

05:29:20.907 --> 05:29:23.710
REALLY IS GOING ON WASTE IS A

05:29:23.777 --> 05:29:26.613
VERB IT IS NOT A NOUN SOMETHING

05:29:26.680 --> 05:29:29.149
IS NOTWASTE UNTIL IT IS WASTED.

05:29:29.216 --> 05:29:31.818
WE WASTE MANY MORE THINGS.

05:29:31.885 --> 05:29:33.887
BASICALLY POOR COUNTRIES DON'T

05:29:33.954 --> 05:29:35.288
WASTE AS MUCH WHEN THEY GET

05:29:35.355 --> 05:29:37.424
RICHER THEY BECOME LIKE US SO

05:29:37.491 --> 05:29:39.226
THEY GOT THEIR OWN JUNK.

05:29:39.292 --> 05:29:41.094
SO NOW WE HAVE ALL THIS STUFF

05:29:41.161 --> 05:29:41.695
THAT WE DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO

05:29:41.761 --> 05:29:42.129
WITH [inaudible]

05:29:42.195 --> 05:29:45.899
BUT WE ALSO HAVE.

05:29:45.966 --> 05:29:48.101
BECAUSE OF THE WAY WE'VE DECIDED

05:29:48.168 --> 05:29:50.237
TO DO CURBSIDE IN MOST PLACES

05:29:50.303 --> 05:29:51.471
NOT MY CITY.

05:29:51.538 --> 05:29:53.206
WE MIX EVERYTHING AND IT BECOMES

05:29:53.273 --> 05:29:56.743
CONTAMINATED SO THE ONLY THING.

05:29:56.810 --> 05:29:58.345
I AM NOT A I DO NOT OPPOSE THE

05:29:58.411 --> 05:30:01.114
BILL BUT I DO THINK THAT.

05:30:01.181 --> 05:30:03.984
UNTIL WE HAVE OUR OWN MARKETS WE

05:30:04.050 --> 05:30:06.720
DO YOU NEED TO TRY TO EXPAND AND

05:30:06.786 --> 05:30:08.989
STRENGTHEN.

05:30:09.055 --> 05:30:11.491
THOSE PLACES WHERE THIS MATERIAL

05:30:11.558 --> 05:30:12.893
CAN BE RECEIVED.

05:30:12.959 --> 05:30:15.228
UNCONTAMINATED BECAUSE THE C. R.

05:30:15.295 --> 05:30:16.897
V. STREAM.

05:30:16.963 --> 05:30:19.166
IS A STREAM THAT CHINA IS STILL

05:30:19.232 --> 05:30:20.333
BUYING.

05:30:20.400 --> 05:30:22.269
IT IS OUR CURBSIDE THAT THEY'RE

05:30:22.335 --> 05:30:25.005
NOT BUYING SO IT.

05:30:25.071 --> 05:30:27.274
THIS IS.

05:30:27.340 --> 05:30:29.709
I WILL NOT IS ANY KIND OF INSULT

05:30:29.776 --> 05:30:31.211
BUT IT ISN'T IN ELEGANT FIX

05:30:31.278 --> 05:30:32.679
THOUGH IT IS UNNECESSARY FIX FOR

05:30:32.746 --> 05:30:34.881
THIS MOMENT BUT WE HAVE TO GET

05:30:34.948 --> 05:30:36.449
THAT THE FIX THAT ALLOWS US TO

05:30:36.516 --> 05:30:38.185
BOTH HAVE A STREAM.

05:30:38.251 --> 05:30:40.554
AND CREATE SOME MARKETS CLEAN

05:30:40.620 --> 05:30:44.691
STREAM IN SOME MARKETS.

05:30:44.758 --> 05:30:46.760
YEAH I MEAN A I AGREE AND I I

05:30:46.826 --> 05:30:47.694
THINK ALSO WHAT YOU'RE GETTING

05:30:47.761 --> 05:30:49.629
AS WE GO AND COMPLETELY TRY TO

05:30:49.696 --> 05:30:51.364
RELY ON CURBSIDE RECYCLING FOR

05:30:51.431 --> 05:30:51.932
EVERYTHING AND YET THEY'RE

05:30:51.998 --> 05:30:52.632
INADEQUATE.

05:30:52.699 --> 05:30:54.134
THEN YOU BASICALLY THROW

05:30:54.201 --> 05:30:54.968
EVERYTHING IN THE LANDFILL

05:30:55.035 --> 05:30:56.703
ANYWAY BECAUSE AS THE REPORT

05:30:56.770 --> 05:30:59.272
POINTED OUT.

05:30:59.339 --> 05:31:00.473
YOU ARE AT I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE

05:31:00.540 --> 05:31:04.945
RATE IS AT WITH THE AVERAGE

05:31:05.011 --> 05:31:05.612
1010102020% THERE WAS THE NUMBER

05:31:05.679 --> 05:31:07.847
IN THERE.

05:31:07.914 --> 05:31:09.282
SO IT'S MILLION LESS YOUR

05:31:09.349 --> 05:31:10.250
CHANCES GO OR BERKELEY WHERE

05:31:10.317 --> 05:31:11.184
PEOPLE ARE UPSTREAM CONSUMERS

05:31:11.251 --> 05:31:13.353
THEMSELVES ARE BEING EXTRA

05:31:13.420 --> 05:31:15.222
DILIGENT ON THE FRONT AND PAYING

05:31:15.288 --> 05:31:17.624
FOR THE CURB THE STILL SEPARATE

05:31:17.691 --> 05:31:18.358
SO ARE.

05:31:18.425 --> 05:31:21.161
YEAH OUR PROCESSING FACILITY.

05:31:21.228 --> 05:31:23.730
IS RIGHT NOW HAVING LESS PROBLEM

05:31:23.797 --> 05:31:25.332
WITH THE PURCHASE BECAUSE OUT

05:31:25.398 --> 05:31:27.901
YOUR ARMOR BECAUSE WE HAVE CLEAN

05:31:27.968 --> 05:31:32.472
LOADS NOT A 100% BUT AND NOT A

05:31:32.539 --> 05:31:34.507
LOT OF OTHER COMMUNITIES DO.

05:31:34.574 --> 05:31:37.077
COMPLETELY AGREE OKAY.

05:31:37.143 --> 05:31:40.513
ALL RIGHT SO.

05:31:40.580 --> 05:31:43.183
LOT MORE WORK TO DO.

05:31:43.250 --> 05:31:44.551
I THE BILL I THINK IS TO MOVE BY

05:31:44.618 --> 05:31:47.687
CINEMA CASKEY -- WITH THAT WELL

05:31:47.754 --> 05:31:50.123
IF YOU CLOSE CENTER [inaudible]

05:31:50.190 --> 05:31:55.161
YOU -- THE QUICK LOOK WE'VE

05:31:55.228 --> 05:31:56.696
WE'VE TRIED IT WE TRIED TO BE

05:31:56.763 --> 05:31:58.632
RESPONSIVE AND AND AND THERE IS

05:31:58.698 --> 05:32:00.300
SOME OF THAT IMPROVE COLLECTION

05:32:00.367 --> 05:32:01.801
BEING ADDRESSED HERE THERE IS

05:32:01.868 --> 05:32:03.169
SOME INCENTIVE FOR THE

05:32:03.236 --> 05:32:04.871
INNOVATIVE RECYCLING TECHNIQUES

05:32:04.938 --> 05:32:05.705
IN TRYING TO RE STIMULATE THE

05:32:05.772 --> 05:32:06.773
MARK I THINK YOU.

05:32:06.840 --> 05:32:09.209
THAT IS IN HERE IS IT ENOUGH NO.

05:32:09.276 --> 05:32:11.244
IS IT IS IT THAT FIX THAT THAT

05:32:11.311 --> 05:32:13.246
LONGER TERM SOLUTION NOTE SO

05:32:13.313 --> 05:32:14.914
AGAIN I DON'T WANT TO OVER

05:32:14.981 --> 05:32:15.982
PROMISE BUT I THINK JUST

05:32:16.049 --> 05:32:17.284
RESTORING RECYCLING INCENTIVE TO

05:32:17.350 --> 05:32:18.518
GET BACK TO AT LEAST TWENTY

05:32:18.585 --> 05:32:19.686
FIFTEEN LEVELS.

05:32:19.753 --> 05:32:22.122
AND TRYING TO REFOCUS THE CAL

05:32:22.188 --> 05:32:24.190
RECYCLE RESOURCES ON TO GETTING

05:32:24.257 --> 05:32:25.158
TO THESE UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES

05:32:25.225 --> 05:32:29.262
IS A POSITIVE STEP -- SO

05:32:29.329 --> 05:32:31.331
HOPEFULLY WE CAN PROMISE AT

05:32:31.398 --> 05:32:32.365
LEAST IN THIS YEAR THAT WILL

05:32:32.432 --> 05:32:34.200
HAVE IF IF FOR THE NEXT YEAR IF

05:32:34.267 --> 05:32:35.702
THIS BILL PASSES WILL BE ABLE.

05:32:35.769 --> 05:32:37.737
TO RESTORE SOME RECYCLING MARKET

05:32:37.804 --> 05:32:39.773
PLACE BUT I DON'T THINK IS

05:32:39.839 --> 05:32:40.440
ENOUGH TO COMPETE WITH NATIONAL

05:32:40.507 --> 05:32:42.542
SOARED -- IT'S GOING TO TAKE

05:32:42.609 --> 05:32:44.277
MORE THAN THAT AND I'M GONNA

05:32:44.344 --> 05:32:45.245
MAKE SOME OF THOSE HARD

05:32:45.312 --> 05:32:46.780
DECISIONS TO DO THAT SO IF THIS

05:32:46.846 --> 05:32:48.381
ENDS UP BEING IF THE STARS

05:32:48.448 --> 05:32:50.050
ALIGNED COVER CYCLE IN THIS

05:32:50.116 --> 05:32:50.984
GOVERNOR ENGAGES IN WE ACTUALLY

05:32:51.051 --> 05:32:52.352
A COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTION.

TEEPEES NO LIKE ALRIGHT HOW DO I

05:34:15.034 --> 05:34:16.936
JUST EXPLAIN THIS BILL SIMPLY.

05:34:17.003 --> 05:34:19.105
OUR ARMED ENERGY COMMISSION HAS

05:34:19.172 --> 05:34:22.175
THE AUTHORITY TO SET ENERGY

05:34:22.242 --> 05:34:24.210
EFFICIENCY TO TO MAKE A POINT

05:34:24.277 --> 05:34:25.712
STANDARDS BASED ON ENERGY

05:34:25.779 --> 05:34:28.248
EFFICIENCY ENERGY EFFICIENCY IS

05:34:28.314 --> 05:34:30.316
ABSOLUTELY STOOD STILL BE OUR

05:34:30.383 --> 05:34:32.051
NUMBER ONE PRIORITY BECAUSE IT

05:34:32.118 --> 05:34:33.686
REFLECTS NEGA WHAT'S.

05:34:33.753 --> 05:34:36.322
BUT AS WE EXPAND NOW TO

05:34:36.389 --> 05:34:37.157
RENEWABLES.

05:34:37.223 --> 05:34:40.226
AND AS WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE.

05:34:40.293 --> 05:34:42.262
OUR DEMAND ON OUR ELECTRICITY

05:34:42.328 --> 05:34:43.630
SYSTEM.

05:34:43.696 --> 05:34:45.231
IS VERY BOLD DURING HE DAY WE

05:34:45.298 --> 05:34:47.300
HAVE THESE PEAK TIMES.

05:34:47.367 --> 05:34:49.803
IT MAKES SENSE BECAUSE WE HAVE

05:34:49.869 --> 05:34:51.971
THE TECHNOLOGY AND THE CAPACITY.

05:34:52.038 --> 05:34:54.073
TO HAVE [inaudible]

05:34:54.140 --> 05:34:57.911
SMART APPLIANCES THAT IF OUR

05:34:57.977 --> 05:35:01.080
ENERGY COMMISSION WAS EMPOWERED

05:35:01.147 --> 05:35:02.582
TO SET STANDARDS FOR THOSE

05:35:02.649 --> 05:35:04.751
APPLIANCES TO BE ABLE TO RESPOND

05:35:04.818 --> 05:35:07.153
TO DEMAND MANAGEMENT.

05:35:07.220 --> 05:35:09.122
THEN THEY COULD BE SET TO BE

05:35:09.189 --> 05:35:11.524
USED DURING TIMES THAT ARE PEAK

05:35:11.591 --> 05:35:13.359
OR DURING TIMES WHEN RENEWABLES

05:35:13.426 --> 05:35:15.228
ARE GENERATING THE HIGHEST.

05:35:15.295 --> 05:35:16.930
AND UTILIZE OUR ELECTRICAL

05:35:16.996 --> 05:35:19.365
RESOURCES BETTER SO WHAT THIS

05:35:19.432 --> 05:35:21.835
BILL DOES IT'S A KIND OF FUNNY.

05:35:21.901 --> 05:35:24.070
IT ALLOWS THE ENERGY COMMISSION

05:35:24.137 --> 05:35:25.939
TO FACTOR THAT DEMAND MANAGEMENT

05:35:26.005 --> 05:35:28.074
IN AND IT DOES SO THROUGH USING

05:35:28.141 --> 05:35:30.143
THE LANDS OF GREENHOUSE GAS

05:35:30.210 --> 05:35:32.679
EMISSIONS BECAUSE RIGHT NOW.

05:35:32.745 --> 05:35:34.948
ALL THE ONLY LENDS THEY CAN USE

05:35:35.014 --> 05:35:36.983
IS INCREASING ENERGY EFFICIENCY

05:35:37.050 --> 05:35:38.318
SO THAT'S IN EFFECT WHAT THE

05:35:38.384 --> 05:35:40.286
BILL DOES.

05:35:40.353 --> 05:35:41.354
AND I HAVE SOME WITNESSES IN

05:35:41.421 --> 05:35:43.389

FORTY NINE AS CALIFORNIA STRIVES

05:36:00.306 --> 05:36:01.708
TO MEET ITS SB ONE HUNDRED GOALS

05:36:01.774 --> 05:36:03.209
IT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO

05:36:03.276 --> 05:36:04.878
ENSURE THAT THE DEMAND OF

05:36:04.944 --> 05:36:07.313
ELECTRICITY MATCHES WHEN THAT

05:36:07.380 --> 05:36:09.115
SUPPLIES CLEANEST ME THAT THERE

05:36:09.182 --> 05:36:10.884
IS HIGH PENETRATION OF THE

05:36:10.950 --> 05:36:12.452
NOBLES ON THE GRADE.

05:36:12.519 --> 05:36:13.987
UNDER SB FORTY NINE WE'LL SEE

05:36:14.053 --> 05:36:16.823

BEING ON OFF YOU KNOW TURN ON

05:36:19.058 --> 05:36:20.360
AND USE IT WHENEVER YOU NEED AT
