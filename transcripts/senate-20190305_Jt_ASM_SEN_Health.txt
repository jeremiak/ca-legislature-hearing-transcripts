OUR JOINT HEARING. WE EXPECT THAT MEMBERS WILL BE JOINING US ON AND OFF THROUGHOUT THE HEARING TODAY BUT WE'D LIKE TO THE INTERESTS OF KEEPING THINGS ON SCHEDULE BY TO GET STARTED. TOYS FOR SMALL SAY CONGRATS GOOD CONGRATULATIONS. TO RVCA CONGRADULATIONS I GUESS FOR WHATEVER FOR WHATEVER YOU KNOW GOOD AFTERNOON HOW LET'S TRY THAT -- ONE AND WE'LL GO AHEAD GET STARTED -- MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ARE A CORE COMPONENT OF THE PROGRAM AND MEDI CAL IS THE MAJOR SOURCE OF FUNDING OF OUR COVERAGE FOR LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS. THE LAST WEEK'S JOINT HEARING WE HEARD HOW THE MEDI CAL SYSTEM IS ADMINISTERED FINANCED AND DELIVERED TODAY'S JOINT INFORMATIONAL HEARING IS INTENDED TO PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF HOW WELL THE MEDI CAL. A MENTAL HEALTH BENEFITS LIBERTY SYSTEM WORKS WHAT CAN BE IMPROVED AND HOW HOW CARE CAN BE BETTER INTEGRATED. WE HAVE A FULL AGENDA SO I'D LIKE TO GET STARTED. ARE THERE ANY MEMBERS WOULD LIKE HAVE ANY COMMENTS BEFORE WE START. OKAY SEE NO ONE WILL ASK OUR FIRST PANEL -- CHEN JENNIFER CAN'T THE DIRECTOR DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND KARIN LARSSON DIRECTOR OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY FOR YOLO COUNTY. ALSO A MEMBER OF THE BOARD OF THE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION SO FORWARD. JEFF ECOMMERCE BEFORE WE START. TO QUIT THAT WE HAD DOCTOR PASSCODE. OKAY HEALTH THANK YOU THANK YOU DOCTOR WORDS AND I THINK YOU AND YOUR STAFF. FOR PUTTING THESE HEARINGS TOGETHER AND REALLY APPRECIATE THAT -- THE INFORMATION WE GOT THE LAST WEEK IN OUR FIRST HEARING HAND PARTICULAR ABOUT THE SERVICES. CLEAN. SEE WE HAVE THE FARM HEALTHCARE SERVICES TO LEADING US OFF BUT HOW WE CAN IMPROVE THE WAY WE DELIVER CARE FOR SOME IS FULL PATIENTS. AND PARTICULARLY THIS IS TIMELY BECAUSE WE HAVE WAIVERS THEY'RE COMING UP -- FOR NOLAN THEM DIRECTLY INTERESTED IN HEARING HOW FAR HEALTHCARE SERVICES. WELL -- AS WE TALKED ABOUT LAST HEARING HOW TO BE GREATER OVERSIGHT. AND HOW WHAT KIND OF DATA WE CANNOT PROGRESS WE'RE TOLD TOWARD OUR MENTAL HEALTH THAT. GOALS IN OUR OF THE PROBLEMS THAT I THINK MANY OF US AS LEGISLATORS. ARE HEARING FROM MY CONSTITUENTS AND ALSO -- WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO TO TRY -- TO TO BASICALLY ADDRESS BOTH MENTAL HEALTH SUBSTANCE USE A REDUCTION IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO -- VERY EXCITED TO HEAR CAN -- PURSUE THOSE AND ALSO BE SURE THAT WE CAN DEMONSTRATE TO THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA THAT WE'RE MAKING PROGRESS ON THE MANY MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE -- USE -- ISSUES THAT THEY SEE AND AND THEIR COMMUNITIES AND OF COURSE -- AND EFFECT EFFECT PERHAPS AFFECTING THEIR OWN NEIGHBORS AND FAMILY SO THANKS VERY MUCH WHICH GREAT SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH JENNIFER CAN -- DIRECTOR FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES -- SO I WOULD LIKE TO KIND OF START OFF BY A SETTING -- A LITTLE BIT OF PERSPECTIVE FROM THE STANDPOINT THAT WE AT THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES -- OPERATE AN OVERSEAS SIX DELIVERY SYSTEM SO WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT REALLY BIG CONSEQUENTIAL PROGRAMS -- IN THE STATE WE ESSENTIALLY HAVE SIX DELIVERY SYSTEMS THAT WERE OPERATING AND AS WE TALKED A LITTLE BIT -- LAST -- HEARING -- THERE'S A FROM SERVICE AND PEOPLE THINK THAT MEDI CAL BASICALLY BREAKS DOWN INTO THOSE TWO DELIVERY SYSTEMS BUT I LIKE TO REMIND PEOPLE. THAT BAY ON FEE FOR SERVICE IN MANAGED CARE WE HAVE THE MENTAL HEALTH DELIVERY SYSTEM WHICH IS COMPOSED OF FIFTY SIX COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH PLANS. ON EACH OF THOSE COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH PLANS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER SERVICES. THEY CAN TAKE THE SHAPE OF BEING A COUNTY THAT'S PARTICIPATING IN OUR ELEVEN FIFTEEN WAIVER THROUGH THE ORGANIZED DELIVERY SYSTEM WHICH IS A SEPARATE MANAGED CARE DELIVERY SYSTEM. AS OPPOSED TO BEING A COUNTY THAT IS DOING IN ON WHAT WE CALL STATE PLAN DRUG MEDICAL SERVICES WHICH ARE FIVE STATE PLAN SERVICES. THEN WE ALSO HAVE THE DENTAL ADD DELIVERY SYSTEM WE HAVE CALIFORNIA CHILDREN'S SERVICES AND SO WHEN YOU START TO LOOK ACROSS THE SPECTRUM. OF WHO ARE BENEFICIARIES ARE OF WHICH WE ARE THE LARGEST PUBLICLY FINANCED PROGRAM IN THE NATION BEHIND MEDICARE SERVING OVER THIRTEEN MILLION CALIFORNIANS. IT GETS REALLY COMPLICATED REALLY QUICKLY I THINK THAT THERE'S A LOT OF INTEREST AND THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF INTEREST IN INDIVIDUALS WHO SUFFER FROM -- MENTAL ILLNESS ESPECIALLY SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS BECAUSE OF THE CONSEQUENCE AND THE IMPACT TO OTHER -- BOTH PROGRAMS AND SERVICES IN THE STATE AS WELL AS TO THE INDIVIDUAL SUFFERING FROM THE ILLNESS. SO WHEN YOU STOP TO OUR MENTAL HEALTH DELIVERY SYSTEM -- THERE AND YOUR AGENDA DOES A REALLY NICE JOB AS NOTING IT -- THERE ARE SEVERAL CONSEQUENTIAL FINANCING SOURCES THAT HELP. UNDER GIRD THAT ENTIRE DELIVERY REALIGNMENT FUNDING SOURCES THERE'S THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT THERE'S SOME STATE GENERAL FUND THERE'S MENTAL HEALTH BLOCK GRANT AND THEN OBVIOUSLY THE MOST IMPORTANT COMPONENT -- FOR WHICH WE WOULD BE AS COMPLETELY REMISS TO NOT MENTION AS THE FEDERAL FUNDS AND WHEN YOU DO THINGS WITH MEDICAID FEDERAL FUNDS. AS YOU WILL QUICKLY ALSO APPRECIATE IS THE RULES AND THE COMPLEXITY AROUND HOW THOSE FUNDS ARE USED IN THE DOCUMENTATION THAT IS REQUIRED IN ORDER FOR THOSE FUNDS TO BE DRAWN DOWN. IS SOME OF THE REASONS WHY WE HAVE THE SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE. SO WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT -- WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. OVERSEEN FIFTY SIX CAN MENTAL HEALTH PLANS THE FIRST ISSUE IS IS THAT THERE'S FIFTY SIX OF THEM -- AND THERE'S A LOT OF THEM AND ONE COUNTIES MENTAL HEALTH -- PROGRAM IS ONE COUNTIES MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAM EACH COUNTY BASED IN THIS LOCALITY BASED IN ITS -- CHOICES AROUND AT THE PROVIDERS THAT THEY CONTRACT WITH -- THE WAY THAT THEY WANT TO DELIVER SERVICES HOW THEY ADMINISTER THE PLAN FOR YOU KNOW APPEALS AND GRIEVANCES AND ALL OF THOSE THINGS ARE AT THE COUNTIES DISCRETION SO WE LIKE TO SAY THAT WE HAVE GIVEN. THE RESPONSIBILITY AND THE FUNDING TO THE COUNTIES AND IT'S UP TO THEM TO DECIDE ON A LOCAL BASIS HOW THEY OPERATIONALIZE THAT OBVIOUSLY WE MAINTAIN OVERSIGHT -- THE PROGRAM BRADLEY READ BUT EACH COUNTY HAS A LOT OF FLEXIBILITY IN HOW THEY DELIVER SERVICES TO BOTH PEDIATRIC AND ADULT POPULATIONS -- WHAT WORKS WELL AND WHAT HAS WORKED WELL -- OR WHAT IS A BENEFIT TO CALIFORNIA'S -- DELIVERY SYSTEM IS THE FACT THAT. COUNTIES HAVE OVER THE YEARS -- REALLY BUILT UP AN AREA OF EXPERTISE AND SERVING -- SERIOUSLY MENTALLY ILL SERIOUSLY MENTALLY ILL POPULATIONS IN A WAY THAT I DON'T KNOW THE OTHER -- ENTITIES VENDORS ARE PROVIDERS CAN STEP IN AND DO IN SUCH A CAPABLE WAY -- THAT POPULATIONS THAT THE COUNTY SERVE AND WORK WITH -- OFTENTIMES THE COUNTIES ARE WORKING CLOSELY WITH THEIR LOCAL JAILS ON THE PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICERS THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM JUVENILE JUSTICE. THESE ARE INDIVIDUALS THAT WILL PROBABLY BE INVOLVED IN NUMEROUS -- PARTS OF THOSE COUNTY BASED SYSTEMS AND I THINK THAT THE EXPERTISE IN TERMS OF THE CLINICAL BACKGROUND AND THE FAMILIAR WITH OUR POPULATIONS THE COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAM CERTAINLY HAVE. A LOT OF STRENGTH IN THAT AREA WHICH WE WOULD BOTH ACKNOWLEDGE AND WANT TO CONTINUE TO PROTECT. I THINK THE THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN MOST CHALLENGING FOR US AS A STATE IS AS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS CHANGED -- IT'S OVERSIGHT AND REQUIREMENTS AROUND HOW BENEFITS ARE DELIVERED -- SO THINK BACK A COUPLE OF YEARS -- TO TWENTY MANAGE CARE RULE WAS PASSED. THE FOR THE FIRST TIME THE COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH PLANS WERE HAVING TO MEET THE STANDARDS BY WHICH OUR MEDICAL MANAGED CARE PLANS WERE HAVING TO IN TERMS OF NETWORK FILENE'S. APPEALS AND GRIEVANCES PRE AUTHORIZATION OF SERVICES AND THERE IS A REALLY SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE COMPLIANCE ASPECT OF DELIVERING CARE THAT THE COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH PLANS HAD NOT DONE BEFORE. THIS COMPLIANCE -- TENDS TO I THINK THE ONE OF THE LARGEST AREAS OF CONCERN TO US AS A DEPARTMENT AND THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF VERY SMALL COUNTIES. I AM I'M JOINED BY A FAIRLY SMALL COUNTY -- BUT THEY'RE VERY SMALL COUNTIES IN WHICH THE CAPACITY AND THE STAFFING TO ACTUALLY FILL THOSE COMPLIANCE -- RESPONSIBILITIES IS SOMEWHAT LACKING -- WE HAVE AND WILL BE PREPARING -- LETTERS GOING OUT TO A SUBSET OF COUNTIES -- RELATING TO THEIR FAILURE TO THE FEDERAL VIOLENCE THAT WERE DUE -- FOR DELIVERY SYSTEMS HAD TO FILE THOSE NETWORK FILING SO MANAGED CARE DENTAL -- SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER AND MENTAL HEALTH AND THERE IS A SUBSET OF COUNTIES ON THE MENTAL HEALTH SIDE THAT HAVE NOT COME INTO COMPLIANCE WITH THEIR CORRECTIVE ACTION PLANS AND SO I WOULD POINT TO THAT AS BEING ONE OF THE AREAS THAT. WE CONTINUE TO HAVE CONCERN AROUND -- WE THINK THAT YOU KNOW COMPLIANCE WITH THE BASIC ISSUES ARE THE BASIS ASPECT ASPECTS OF THE PROGRAM ARE IMPORTANT BECAUSE ONCE YOU CAN MASTER THE BASICS THEN WE CAN GO ON TO TALKING ABOUT -- BIGGER BROADER MORE AND INNOVATIVE CHANGES -- I THINK THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE SEE IN FRONT OF US AS A DEPARTMENT AND CERTAINLY WANTING TO WORK WITH -- THE COUNTIES AND THE LEGISLATURE AS WELL AS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT EXTERNAL STAKEHOLDERS IS THE RENEWAL OF THE WAIVERS WE HAVE AN ELEVEN FIFTEEN WAIVER THAT EXPIRES ON DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY AND ARE NINETEEN FIFTEEN WAIVER EXPIRES IN JUNE OF TWENTY TWENTY SO THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF A MISSING. TIME FRAME THERE BUT I THINK WHAT WE'RE THINKING OF IS HOW DO WE CONTINUE AS A DEPARTMENT AND AS A STATE TO PUSH THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ASPECTS OF THE INDIVIDUAL'S NEEDS CLOSER TO THE OVERALL DELIVERY SYSTEM SUCH THAT WE'RE NOT EXPECTING PEOPLE. WITH A SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS HAVE TO NAVIGATE DIFFERENT DELIVERY SYSTEMS -- WE AS A DEPARTMENT ARE -- TAKING A LOOK AT OUR OWN DIVISIONS AND DOING INTEGRATION WITHIN OUR OWN DIVISIONS WE HAVE ANNOUNCED A REORGANIZATION OF OUR EXISTING MENTAL HEALTH AN S. U. D. DIVISIONS -- COLLAPSING THEM INTO A BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIVISION I'M SEPARATING OUT THE MEDI CAL FROM THE NON MEDICAL ASPECTS BUT WE ALSO THINK THAT THAT'S IMPORTANT BOTH AS AS STATE DEPARTMENT AS WELL AS PROGRAM MEDICALLY. TO CONTINUE -- TO HAVE OUR STAFF BE SITTING CLOSER TO OTHER DELIVERY SYSTEMS AND CREATING THAT BODY OF EXPERTISE SUCH THAT THE INDIVIDUAL BENEFICIARY. WHO IS RECEIVING THOSE SERVICES -- DOESN'T HAVE TO HAVE SUCH A COMPLICATING EVEN IF IT'S COMPLICATED ON THE BACK AND THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE TO FIGURE OUT THE COMPLICATION ON THE FRONT END. SO I I POTS ON THE WAIVERS -- AS KIND OF ONE OF THE MOST EXCITING CONSEQUENTIAL -- THINGS THAT WE ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO ENGAGING IN LATER THIS YEAR AND THE NEXT YEAR -- FOR FOR CERTAIN AS IT PERTAINS TO THE WAIVER RENEWALS ON BOTH SIDES. AND THEN LASTLY I THINK WHAT YOU WILL I CAN'T WHILE HE KATE DIRECTOR LOOK FAR OUT INTO THE FUTURE -- AS YOUR AGENDA WOULD KNOW KIND OF WHAT'S THE NEXT FIVE TO TEN TO FIFTEEN YEARS LOOK LIKE -- A LOT OF THE THINGS THAT WE STRUGGLE TO EITHER IMPLEMENT OR OPERATIONALIZE TODAY AT A STATE LEVEL ARE -- HISTORICAL VESTIGES OF A PROGRAM THAT HAS BEEN BUILT OVER DECADES AND SO DECISIONS THAT WERE MADE IN THE EIGHTIES DECISIONS THAT WERE MADE IN THE NINETIES DECISIONS THAT WERE MADE IN THE TWO THOUSANDS. WE STILL HAVE -- TO WORK ACCORDING TO THOSE DECISIONS BUT THEN THERE HAS BEEN OVERLAY AND CHANGES AND DIFFERENT FUNDING SOURCES. AND I THINK THAT WHAT WE LOOK AT FROM FIVE TO TEN TO FIFTEEN YEARS OUT IS. HOW DO WE HAVE -- COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH PLANS HOW DO WE HAVE PROVIDERS HOW DO WE HAVE MANAGED CARE PLANS WORKING IN A BETTER ALIGNMENT WITH EACH OTHER -- WE MAY NEVER BE ABLE TO FULLY INTEGRATE THOSE BECAUSE OF EITHER FINANCING OR OTHER COMPLICATIONS BUT I THINK WHAT WE REALLY WANT TO SEE IS A CONTINUED BOTH -- INCREASED RELIANCE ON EACH OTHER AS WELL AS OUR THEIR FINANCIAL WAYS THAT WE CAN TIE SERVICES TOGETHER THROUGH THOSE ENTITIES SUCH THAT THEY ARE INCLINED TO WORK TOGETHER AS OPPOSED TO BEING -- WORKING IN SILOS I THINK THAT WE IMAGINE A WORLD IN WHICH WE ARE DOING A LOT MORE -- INNOVATIVE FINANCING AS OPPOSED ASIDE ON A SEAT. I'M SORT OF FINISHERS THESE ARE VERY VERY HEAVY DOCUMENTATION RELIANT TYPES OF FINANCING MECHANISMS IN WHICH A COUNTY PAYS. TWO DOLLARS FOR A SERVICE THEY SUBMIT A CLAIM TO US WE DRIVE DOWN A DOLLAR FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND THEN WE PAY IT BACK TO THEM. THAT IS NOT NECESSARILY A WAY THAT IS THE MOST -- EFFICIENT OR EFFECTIVE WAY OF DELIVERING HEALTHCARE TODAY'S SO. THAT I'M HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS AND CERTAINLY LOOK FOR TO THE CONVERSATION. THANK YOU TO FORGET WILL TAKE QUESTIONS AFTER WE'VE HEARD FROM BOTH PANELS SO. THIRD AFTERNOON I'M KAREN LARSON I'M THE DIRECTOR OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES FOR YOLO COUNTY -- IT'S HONOR TO BE HERE IT'S A PRIVILEGE TO BE SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE UNDERSERVED POPULATION IN CALIFORNIA THAT ARE STRUGGLING WITH SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS AND AND OUR YOUNGER PEOPLE WHO ARE DEALING WITH EMOTIONAL DISTURBANCE AND POVERTY AND TOXIC STRESS AND A LOT OF TRAUMA. AND I THINK THAT IT'S TIMELY THAT WE'RE HAVING THIS DISCUSSION TODAY BECAUSE IN RECENT YEARS IT'S BECOME ABUNDANTLY CLEAR THAT MOST OF THE MAJOR SOCIETAL ISSUES WERE FACING HAVE. SUBSTANCE USE AND MENTAL HEALTH AT THE IT'S HOMELESSNESS OR CRIMINAL JUSTICE OR CHAO WELFARE ALL OF ALL OF THOSE ISSUES HAVE SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND MENTAL HEALTH INTERWOVEN IN THEM AND WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT A WAY. TO PARTNER TAKE IT TO BETTER OUTCOMES FOR ALL OF THOSE HUMAN BEINGS. AM I THINK IT TOO I IT'S NICE TO SIT UP HERE WITH JENNIFER AND TO HEAR GO AFTER HER AND TO BE ABLE TO SAY THAT I AGREE WITH ALMOST EVERYTHING SHE SAID SO. THAT THAT'S NICE THAT -- BECAUSE I DON'T THINK WE NECESSARILY AGREE ON EVERYTHING BUT I THINK WE BOTH ARE COGNIZANT OF WHAT. WHAT PROBLEMS WE'RE FACING WHAT CHALLENGES WE HAVE AS A STATE AND IN OUR MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM? AND THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR IMPROVEMENT I THINK WE WERE VERY SIMILAR IN THE WAY WE SEE US MOVING FORWARD. AM I I THINK IT. YOU ALLUDED CAM JENNIFER ALLUDED TO THIS A LITTLE BIT BUT OUR MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM HAS BEEN CREATED OVER YEARS IN RESPONSE. TO LEGISLATIVE CHANGES SOME LAWSUITS AND THEN A MYRIAD OF FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS THAT SEEM TO JUST PILE ON TOP OF ONE ANOTHER INSTEAD OF KIND OF FIGURING OUT A WAY FOR THOSE THINGS TO WORK SEAMLESSLY. SO WHAT WHAT WORKS WELL. AT THE SLIDES ARE JUST AS MUCH TO KEEP ME ON TRACK AS FOR ALL OF YOU -- I AS YOU ALL KNOW WE HAD THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT THAT'S BEEN AN AMAZING THING FOR OUR STATEMENT CALIPH WE HAVE A LOT MORE CALIFORNIANS THAT. ARE ON MEDICARE ALL AND A LOT MORE -- CALIFORNIANS THEY'RE RECEIVING BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CARE AND WHILE THERE'S STILL PLENTY OF WORK TO DO WITHIN THAT. IT'S AN IMPROVEMENT OVER WHERE WE WERE BEFORE THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT -- WE ALSO IN CALIFORNIA ARE LUCKY ENOUGH TO HAVE THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT -- AT WHILE IT IS ROLLED OUT DIFFERENTLY IN EVERY COUNTY IT HAS BEEN. A GREAT WAY FOR COUNTIES TO BE ABLE -- TO BUILD SERVICES THAT AREN'T NECESSARILY BILLABLE TO A MEDIC COW FEE FOR SERVICE SYSTEM -- MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT HAS -- GROWN A LOT OF OUR OUT REGION ENGAGEMENT -- A LOT OF THESE KIND OF WRAP AROUND SERVICES A LOT OF SERVICES -- FOR CLIENTS WHO ARE UNWILLING OR UNABLE TO COME THROUGH THE FRONT DOOR OF A BUILDING THAT'S CALLED MENTAL HEALTH SO IT'S REALLY ALLOWED UNITIES AND PARTNER WITH OUR COMMUNITIES TO ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES. AM I AND I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THAT WE DO REALLY WELL AS COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH OR AT THE LOCAL LEVEL IS TO PARTNER WITH. OUR OTHER COUNTY PARTNERS TO SEE THE SAME POPULATION TO THERE'S CROSS OVER WHETHER IT BE OUR EDUCATIONAL PARTNERS PROBATION CHILD WELFARE OUR PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS -- WE PARTNER PRETTY WELL WITH THEM I I HAVE A FEW EXAMPLES OF THE LAST FEW YEARS -- THAT'S THE STATEWIDE INITIATIVES THAT HAVE BEEN PRETTY SUCCESSFUL WE HAD SB EIGHTY TWO A FEW YEARS AGO WHICH ALLOWED US TO HAVE A LOT MORE RESPONSE AVAILABLE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL FOR CRACK FOR PEOPLE IN MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS WE WERE ABLE TO BUILD. CRISIS RESIDENTIAL AS AN URGENT CARES AND HAVE MOBILE CRISIS RESPONSE TEAMS. ON A CONTINUUM OF CARE FORM. WHICH IS SOMETIMES SEEN AS A FOUR LETTER WORD HAS FORCED OUR SYSTEMS TO WORK TOGETHER TO REALLY IMPROVE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH OUTCOMES FOR THERE ARE CHILDREN INVOLVED IN THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM. TO BRING THOSE USE HOME FROM CONGREGATE CARE SETTINGS AND PROVIDE THEM WITH TRAUMA INFORMED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES. AT THE STEPPING UP MOVEMENT HAS BEEN ADOPTED BY MANY COUNTIES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA AND IT'S AIMED AT REDUCING THE NUMBERS OF MENTALLY ILL IN CUSTODY -- AND IT'S BEEN PRETTY SUCCESSFUL -- AND THEN THE DRUG MEDICAL ORGANIZED EVERY SYSTEM HAS BEEN GREAT FOR THOSE COUNTIES WHO HAVE CHOSEN TO OPT IN -- AGAIN IT PROVIDES. RESIDENTS OF CALIFORNIA WITH BENEFITS THAT THEY HAVE NEVER HAD BEFORE THAT ARE -- NOT ONLY HELP THE RESIDENTS BUT HELP THE STATE IN TERMS OF TRYING DOWN ADDITIONAL FEDERAL FUNDS. AND LAST BUT CERTAINLY NOT LEAST ARE NO PLACE LIKE HOME AND SHE DID WHICH IS MOVING FORWARD I THINK THERE WERE SEVERAL COUNTIES THAT APPLIED FOR THAT FUNDING AND I'M EXCITED TO SEE HOW HAVING MORE HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES FOR PEOPLE STRUGGLING WITH MENTAL ILLNESS -- WILL HELP TO AMELIORATE HOMELESSNESS AND HELP THEM BE MORE STABLE. AM. I THINK IT WOULD BE GREAT TO SEE AND MAYBE THESE HAPPEN AND WE DON'T SEE THEM AT THE COUNTY LEVEL BUT TO SEE SOME OF THAT CROSS DEPEND DEPARTMENTAL WORK HAPPEN AT THE STATE LEVEL. IT OFTEN FEELS LIKE DIFFERENT STATE DEPARTMENTS. ARE NOT SPEAKING TO ANOTHER ARE NOT. TOWARD THE SAME AND AND THAT WOULD BE A REALLY NICE THING FOR US TO SEE AND I THINK HOMELESSNESS IS GONNA DEMANDED OF US RIGHT WE HAVE. SO MANY STATE DEPARTMENTS WORKING ON HOMELESSNESS AND WE ALL SHOULD BE WORKING TOGETHER AND HOPEFULLY HEADED TOWARDS THE SAME METRICS [inaudible] SO. WHAT NEEDS IMPROVEMENT? UNFORTUNATELY THE SLIDE -- I WAS ACTUALLY A LITTLE HARDER TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO LIMITED THAN -- TO WHAT I WAS GONNA PUT ON IT -- THESE ARE JUST SOME OF THE STATS THAT THAT ARE STAGGERING -- WHILE AN ESTIMATED 5% OF CALIFORNIA STRUGGLE WITH SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS AN ESTIMATED 25% OF OUR HOMELESS CALIFORNIANS ARE SMI. THAT'S BASED ON SELF REPORT AT POINT ON THE AT THE POINT IN TIME COUNTS THE ACTUAL PERCENTAGE IS MUCH HIGHER. IN CALIFORNIA THE SUICIDE IS THE LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH FOR YOU JUST TWENTY FIVE TO THIRTY FOUR AND THE THIRD LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH FOR YOUTH AGE. TEN TO TWENTY FOUR OUR SUICIDE RATE IN CALIFORNIA IS HIGHER THAN OUR HOMICIDE RATE BY ALMOST DOUBLE SO YOU'RE MORE LIKELY TO TWICE AS LIKELY. TO HARM YOURSELF AND TO BE KILLED BY SOMEONE ELSE IN OUR STATE. YET IF WE COMPARE OUR INVESTMENT IN PREVENTION VERSUS PUBLIC SAFETY. THERE'S NOT A COMPARISON -- AND ALSO THAT APPROXIMATELY 21% OF CALIFORNIAN EIGHT STATEWIDE HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AS A SEMI. AGAIN THIS IS TAKEN AT BOOKING BASED ON SELF REPORT AND WE KNOW THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE IN CUSTODY. THAT DON'T SELF REPORT THEIR DIAGNOSES. AND LAST BUT CERTAINLY NOT LEAST WE CAN'T FORGET OUR LITTLE PEOPLE WHICH I FEEL LIKE WE DO ON OCCASION AT ONE IN THREE USED TO ASPECTS OF FOSTER CARE IN CALIFORNIA. EXPERIENCE HOMELESSNESS WITHIN TWENTY FOUR MONTHS. AND THEIR TRAJECTORY IN OUR STATE. IS SUCH THAT FORMER FOSTER YOUTH ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY REPRESENTED IN OUR ADULT POINT% IN TIME COUNT. AS WE THAT WE DO EVERY YEAR AND I THINK. ALL OF THE STATISTICS JUST INDICATE THAT OUR SYSTEM ISN'T WORKING AS WELL AS IT SHOULD BE. I THINK UP A PART OF IT. THE ISSUE IS THAT OUR SYSTEM INCENTIVIZE IS THE WRONG THINGS AND WE'D LIKE TO GET IT TO A PLACE IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE STATE. TO FIND A WAY TO INCENTIVIZE THE RIGHT THINGS AND GET TO THE WORDS THE OUTCOMES -- AND IMPROVE THE TRAJECTORY OF ALL OF THESE. SO WE HAVE SOME CURRENT STRUCTURAL CHALLENGES. AGAIN THIS MAY BE I I'M JUST KIND OF SAYING THE SAME THINGS THAT JENNIFER DID AN EACH COUNTY MANAGES THEIR OWN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH BENEFITS SO THAT MEANS EACH COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH BENEFIT LOOKS A LITTLE DIFFERENT -- WE MISSED OPPORTUNITIES -- FOR FISSION SEES OF SCALE AND AND THE REALLY SMALL COUNTIES HAVE A REALLY HARD TIME -- MANAGING THAT -- THE REQUIREMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH MANAGING PAPER HEALTH BENEFITS. WE HAVE A RELATIVELY INEFFICIENT FEE FOR SERVICE REIMBURSEMENT STRUCTURE THERE'S SOME PRETTY ARDUOUS DOCUMENTATION WE HAVE. TO BILL BY THE MINUTE AND AT WE HAVE TO DOCUMENT FUNCTIONAL IMPAIRMENT AND IT'S NOT FOCUSED ON WELL BEING ON RECOVERY IT'S FOCUSED ON A MEDICAL MODEL SYSTEM DESPITE THE FACT THAT. ALL EVIDENCE SHOWS IS THAT THOSE MORE SOCIAL MODEL PROGRAMS ACTUALLY ACHIEVE MUCH BETTER OUTCOMES FOR THE PEOPLE WE SIR. AM I THINK THE THE CROSS SYSTEM CARE COORDINATION WE CAN'T TALK ABOUT THAT ENOUGH I AM GOING TO TALK ABOUT IT AGAIN. THE INTEGRATIONSLIDE BUT I THINK IT'S WHERE WE HAVE THE BIGGEST BENT POTENTIAL BENEFITS IS WHEN WE ALL WORK TOGETHER -- ACROSS SYSTEMS TO ADDRESS THESE KIND OF SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH THAT -- REALLY -- DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECT MENTAL ILLNESS AND I LITTLE PEOPLE THAT ARE INVOLVED IN MULTIPLE SYSTEMS THROUGHOUT THE TRAJECTORY OF THEIR LIFE -- OUR ERA. OUR MENTAL HEALTH CONSUMERS I'M SURE YOU'VE ALL HEARD THIS STAT AND IT SHOULD OF BEEN ON THE LAST FLIGHT BUT IT'S ON THIS ONE IT. DIE ON AVERAGE TWENTY FIVE YEARS YOUNGER THAN THEIR COUNTERPARTS OF PREVENTABLE CHRONIC CONDITIONS AND I WE ALL AGREE THAT THAT'S NOT THE WAY WE WANT TO TAKE CARE OF OUR PEOPLE THAT ARE STRUGGLING. I THINK THE TO FURTHER COMPOUND THE THE LIMITED SPENDING BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH WHERE THE SEVENTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD WHERE THE FORTY EIGHTH IN TERMS OF SPENDING ON OUR MEDICARE POPULATION. TO FURTHER COMPOUND THIS LIMITED SPENDING. WE SPEND AT LEAST THIRTY CENTS OF EVERY DOLLAR ON ADMINISTRATIVE KIND OF FUNCTIONS -- OVERHEAD. AND THEN ON TOP OF THAT MOST COUNTIES HAVE. TO BUDGET OR FIGURE OUT A WAY TO HAVE ABOUT TWENTY CENTS OF EVERY DOLLAR DISALLOWED IF THEY AREN'T. PERFORMING TO THAT RAGS THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT LAYS DOWN. SO THAT MEANS THAT OFTENTIMES COUNTIES ARE HAVE FIFTY CENTS OF EVERY DOLLAR TO GIVE TO THE PEOPLE THEY SERVE. IN IN YOLO WEEK WHO WE ARE RELATIVELY SMALL WE USED TO BUDGET FOR A MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR FOR AUDIT EXCEPTIONS AND THEN WE HAD A 30% OF OUR CLAIMS DISALLOWED. SO WE FIXED IT BUT IT CAME AT A COST BECAUSE WE HAD TO HIRE ADMINISTRATIVE STAFF. RATHER THAN CLINICAL STAFF AND IT'S NOT THE MOST EFFICIENT USE OF RESOURCES. SO SUGGESTIONS FOR IMPROVEMENTS TO THE STATE RIGHT BENEFITS -- I I DO MY BEST IN THIS PRESENTATION TO KIND OF TALK ABOUT SHORT MID TERM KIND OF THINGS WE CAN DO AND THEN MAYBE LONGER TERM. I THINK PURSUING I AM D. EXCLUSION. MAKES REALLY GOOD SENSE I THINK MOST OF US AGREE THAT IT DOES I THINK WE CAN PROBABLY GET THERE AND IT BRINGS DOWN ADDITIONAL FEDERAL FUNDS WHICH IS ALWAYS HELPFUL. I'M REINFORCING UPSTREAM INVESTMENT I DON'T THINK ANY OF US HAVE A CHOICE I THINK IT'S WHAT WE ALL HAVE TO DO I THINK WITH OUR NEW ADMINISTRATION WERE ABSOLUTELY HEADING THIS WAY -- THE FOCUS IN THE MOST RECENT BUDGET ON UNIVERSAL SCREENING FOR TRAUMA AND THEY SHIFT TOWARDS A MORE UPSTREAM MAKES REALLY GREAT SENSE AND IT'S EXCITING. IN TERMS OF LOOKING AT THE LONG TERM OUTCOMES OF THE PEOPLE WE SERVE. AND THEN MOVING TO THIS PAY FOR PERFORMANCE MODEL OR AWAY FROM FEE FOR SERVICE KIND OF MODEL I THINK. WHATEVER IT LOOKS LIKE THE WAY WE'RE DOING IT NOW ISN'T REALLY WORKING FOR IT FOR THE PEOPLE WE SERVE IT'S NOT WORKING FOR THE COUNTIES I WOULD ARGUE IT'S PROBABLY NOT WORKING VERY WELL FOR THE STATE. AND SO WE'D LIKE TO GET TO A PLACE WHERE WE'RE PAYING FOR OUTCOMES THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT OUTCOMES AND INCENTIVIZING THOSE POSITIVE OUTCOMES FOR THE PEOPLE WE SERVE [inaudible] SO INTEGRATION. AGAIN THIS IS ONE THAT I THINK WE HAVE SOME SHORTER TERM THINGS WE CAN DO AND AND LONGER TERM I THINK WE WOULD ALL AGREE THAT. INTEGRATING CARE FOR MENTAL HEALTH SUBSTANCE USE AND PHYSICAL HEALTH MAKES REALLY GOOD SENSE I DON'T THINK MOST OF US WOULD HAVE DESIGNED THE SYSTEM THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE THAT. BIFURCATED AT LEAST AND TRY FOR KATE IT WHICH I DON'T THINK IT'S ACTUALLY A WORD AT BEST -- WE AT AND IT'S A LONG ROAD TO GET TO FULL INTEGRATION I THINK IT'S A PRETTY HEAVY LIFT AND SO. I THINK THAT STARTING WITH -- STRENGTHENING THE INTEGRATION BETWEEN MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER TREATMENT MAKES REALLY GOOD SENSE I THINK THERE SOME EASY THINGS WE CAN DO IN THE SHORT TERM TO REALLY. GROW THAT INTEGRATION -- AYE I DO THINK THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT WE CAN DO -- TO GROW THE INTEGRATION WITH. I WOULD LOVE TO SEE AN INVESTMENT IN TRAINING PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS TO INCREASE THEIR SCOPE AND COMFORT IN TREATING PEOPLE WITH SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS. I DON'T MEAN NECESSARILY TREATING THEIR MENTAL ILLNESS I MEAN JUST HAVING TIME IN A VISIT. TO TREAT SOMEBODY'S PHYSICAL HEALTH CONDITION TO STRUGGLING WITH SM I.. AND ACTUALLY INCENTIVIZE THEM AND ALLOW THEM SOME EXTRA TYPE OF REIMBURSEMENT FOR THOSE VISITS BECAUSE THEY ARE GOING TO TAKE LONGER THAN FIFTEEN MINUTES IN EVERY SINGLE CASE -- I THINK IT WOULD BE GREAT IF WE COULD SUPPORT ALIGNMENT OF HEALTH AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH OUTCOMES TOGETHER -- AND FIGURE OUT A WAY. TO INCENTIVIZE THAT ARE OR OR GROW THAT THEM. BREAK DOWN THE SILOS I GUESS BETWEEN THE FUNDING BETWEEN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND PHYSICAL HEALTH. AM I THINK WE CAN ALL GET TO THIS PLACE OF INTEGRATION IF WE WORK TOGETHER ACROSS SYSTEMS I HAVE EVERY CONFIDENCE THAT EVERYONE DOING THIS WORK IS COMMITTED TO DOING BETTER BY THE PEOPLE WE SERVE INTO -- IMPROVING THOSE OUTCOMES FOR THE PEOPLE WHO ARE CURRENTLY DYING OF CHRONIC CAM PREVENTABLE CONDITIONS. SO THIS IS OUR VISION FOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH TRANSFORMATION. I'LL TALK AGAIN ABOUT -- A SHORTER TERM AND LONGER TERM. GOALS AND I'M GONNA CHANNEL A LITTLE BIT OUR NEW SURGEON GENERAL FOR CALIFORNIA. SPECIFICALLY THE EPILOGUE FROM HER NEW BOOK IF YOU HAVEN'T READ IT I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT -- I I WANT US TO ALL BE BOLD IN OUR VISION OF THE FUTURE WHERE EVERY MEDI CAL BENEFICIARIES WHO NEEDS MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES GETS THOSE SERVICES. WHEN THEY WANT THEM IN THE PLACE THAT'S COMFORTABLE FOR THEM? AM IT WOULD BE REALLY GREAT IF WE COULD GET TO A MODERNIZE KIND OF VERSION OF MEDICAL NECESSITY THAT REALLY LOOKS AT THOSE -- TOXIC STRESS AND AND TROM IN A CARE EARLIER IN THEIR LIFE. SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE SUCH HORRIBLE AND OUTCOMES ON THE BACK END OF THEIR LIFE SPAN -- FOCUSING ON QUALITY OF CARE AND OUTCOMES -- I'VE TALKED ABOUT THAT THAT'S ONE OF OUR RECOMMENDATIONS SIMPLIFYING HOWEVER WE CAN BILLING INCLUDE CLAIMING. FIGURING OUT HOW TO REDUCE THAT ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN. FINDING A WAY TO GROW OUR WORK FORCE THIS I CAN'T SAY ENOUGH. I'LL SAY IT TWICE HAVE FINING WAY TO GROW OUR WORK FORCE. AND IN MAYBE THE SOME OF THE NONTRADITIONAL WAYS -- I'M SURE YOU'VE ALL HEARD ABOUT HERE WORK FORCE IN BRINGING IN PEOPLE WITH LIVED EXPERIENCE TO HELP THOSE PEOPLE THAT ARE STRUGGLING WE REALLY FIND THAT'S ONE OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE STRATEGIES WE CAN EMPLOY -- AS WE'RE DOING THIS COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES. IT WOULD BE GREAT IF WE COULD FIND A WAY TO TELL OUR STATE WIDE STORY IF WE COULD -- FIND A WAY TO NOT HAVE FIFTY SIX DIFFERENT SYSTEMS OR A CUSTOM COMMON METRICS THAT ARE FOCUSED ON QUALITY THAT WE COULD REPORT OUT AND SHARE. AND GET FEEDBACK ON GET TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE SO THAT WE COULD MOVE TOWARDS A BETTER SYSTEM FOR ALL. AM HAVING REGIONAL -- MODELS MIGHT BE AN INTROSPECTIVE MIGHT BE THE FOREVER STEP BECAUSE WE'RE SUCH A LARGE STATE BUT HAVING SOME REGIONAL MODELS MIGHT HELP US GET THERE SOONER RATHER THAN. HAVING A STATEWIDE SYSTEM. AND IT WOULD BE GREAT TO HAVE A SET OF RULES OR GUIDELINES FOR THE BREADTH OF THE ENTITLEMENT PROGRAMS -- I THINK ABOUT STANDING ORDERS THAT DOCTORS OFTEN GIVE US IF THIS THAN THIS AND SO IT WOULD BE REALLY GREAT FOR THE THOSE OF US MANAGING THE CARE TO HAVE A CLEAR OUTLINE OF WHAT IS EXPECTED. AS PROVIDERS OF SERVICE FOR THE PEOPLE THAT WERE INTENDED TO SERVE. HALF OF THESE RECOMMENDATIONS THE DIVIDENDS WILL BE PAID -- WELL INTO THE FUTURE I THINK WE HAVE SOME HEAVY LIFTING TO DO I I THINK WE HAVE NEVER BEFORE SEEN SO MANY PARTNERS. COMING TO THE TABLE SAYING THEY'RE WILLING TO HELP US GET TO THE SOLUTION AND SO I'M ENERGIZED BY BY THE MULTIPLE HEARINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING THIS MONTH AROUND MENTAL HEALTH AND ALL OF THE LEGISLATIVE IDEAS THAT I SEE AROUND THIS TOPIC -- I WOULD LOVE TO SEE A FUTURE WHERE WE'RE REDUCING HOMELESSNESS. JUVENILE JUSTICE INVOLVEMENT CHAO WILL FOR INVOLVEMENT AND IMPROVING THE HEALTH OUTCOMES FOR THOSE WHO ARE SUFFERING WITH MENTAL ILLNESS -- I THINK WE CAN GET THERE IF WE ALL WORK TOGETHER THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- OTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE PAN. I THANK THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH -- APPRECIATE THANK YOU BOTH FOR YOUR PRESENTATIONS -- DIRECTOR TENT AND ALSO DOCTOR LARSON. TO REPRESENT PART OF YELLOW COUNTY APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT YOUR DEPARTMENT DOES -- I GUESS. LAST LAST HEARING -- I BROUGHT THE ISSUE ABOUT STATE OVERSIGHT. AND I GUESS -- AND ACTUALLY HEARING -- DOCTOR LARSON'S TESTIMONY AND TALK ABOUT WHAT'S OUR STATE WIDE STORY IN SOME SENSES THAT SAM BUT FRUSTRATED I DON'T KNOW WHAT STATEWIDE STORY IS BECAUSE IT'S COUNTY BY COUNTY BY COUNTY NOT THAT. DIFFERENT COUNTIES ARE DOING SOME REALLY WONDERFUL STUFF. RIGHT -- BUT YEAH LAST HEARING WHAT WE HEARD WAS IS THAT OUT AT LEAST ON THE MEDI CAL SIDE -- BECAUSE IN NINETY ONE REALIGNMENT ESSENTIALLY -- YOU KNOW COUNTIES HAD RESOURCES JUST BASED ON HOW THAT CASCADE OF TAX REVENUE FALLS DOWN SO I GUESS THE FIRST QUESTION IS IS THAT -- FOR FOR DHS IS IS THAT -- IN TERMS OF OVERSIGHT OVER THE PROGRAM IS THERE SOME ASSESSMENT AS TO WHAT THE THE NEED OUR DEMAND ON MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES THAT WITH THE REASON ACTUALLY HAS A VERY THE MEDI CAL SITE. WE HAVE A BECAUSE WE WERE FOR NEEDS BASED ON THIS CASCADE OF REVENUE THAT FALLS AND WHATEVER. FINALLY IT LANDS IN THE MIDDLE HEALTH POD IS WHAT THEY GOT TO WORK WITH WHAT THE MATCH. ON THE FEDERAL SIDE BUT THERE MAY BE A DISCONNECT BETWEEN THAT AND THE THE AND THE NEED IN AND THE COUNTY BUT ARE WE DOING SOME ASSESSMENT SO WE KNOW WHERE THIS WHERE THAT'S HAPPENING AND HOW HOW SEVERE IT IS -- I DON'T THINK THAT IT'S IT'S PROBABLY NOT THAT EASY SO THERE IS A IS EASY YEAH THERE'S A REALIGNMENT FUNDING SOURCES -- THE NINETY ONE REALIGNMENT AS YOU NOTED IN THE TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN REALIGNMENT -- COUNTIES ARE ABLE TO USE BOTH THOSE FUNDS SOURCES AS WELL AS MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT FUNDS AS WELL AS CAN GENERAL FUNDS IF THEY CHOOSE TO THERE'S SOME LIMITED. AND HEALTH BLOCK GRANT FUNDS -- AND THEN OBVIOUSLY THE FEDERAL FUNDS THE WAY THAT REALIGNMENT WAS DONE ON WINDOWS NINETY ONE IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN IS THE COUNTIES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ENTITLEMENT. I MEAN THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR PROVIDING WHATEVER'S NECESSARY FOR THE INDIVIDUALS MEETING THAT ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA AND MEETING MEDICAL NECESSITY THE FUNDS SOURCES NOT NECESSARILY -- TO B. YOU KNOW I TRACKING WITH THE PERSON'S INDIVIDUAL MEDICAL NEEDED IS A YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY A VERY COMPLICATED RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE STATE AND THE COUNTIES IN TERMS OF HOW REALIGNMENT FUNDS HAVE BEEN DIVVIED UP THEIR TAX. SOURCES THAT YOU KNOW BASED ON HOW THE STATE IS DOING ECONOMICALLY THAN FUND SOURCES FLOW DOWN AND VARIOUS -- STREAMS BUT I THINK THAT -- WE WORK REALLY CLOSELY WITH THE COUNTIES -- ON THE ACCOUNTING FOR THOSE FUNDS OBVIOUSLY AS IT RELATES TO THE C. PEAS AND THE DRAWDOWN OF THE FEDERAL DOLLARS -- THERE IS. SOME PROVISIONS IN THIS IN THE STATUTE -- AROUND COUNTY FUNDING FOR STE -- SERVICES SUCH AS LIKE I AM DIS -- IN WHICH COUNTIES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING FOR INSTITUTES FOR MENTAL DISEASE -- STAYS THERE IS NO F. P. ASSOCIATED WITH THAT COUNTIES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING FOR THOSE SERVICES -- WE HAVE REMINDED THE COUNTIES THROUGH RECENT AYE ENDS THAT THEY'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT. THERE ARE PROVISIONS IN THE STATUTE THAT IF IT COUNTY SAYS I DON'T HAVE THE FUNDING TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE THE SERVICE FOR SERVICES FOR INDIVIDUALS IN MY COUNTY. THEY CAN COME TO THE STATE THEY HAPPEN THEY DON'T HAVE THE FUNDS SOURCES AND THEN A CONVERSATION WITH INTO AND TO MY HISTORICAL KNOWLEDGE NO COUNTY HAS EVER. HAD THAT CONVERSATION WITH THE STATE. OKAY FIRST I GUESS -- WELL I KNOW IT'S COMPLICATED AND I THINK HAVING SOME ASSESSMENT AS TO HOW WERE YOU KNOW. BECAUSE WE HAVE AGAIN FIFTY EIGHT DIFFERENT COUNTIES AS YOU AS YOU MENTIONED. KNOWING WHERE WE ARE WITH RELATIVES EACH COUNTY AND THE RESOURCES THEY HAVE AVAILABLE I THINK IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE YOUR ACCESS TO MIDDLE HOW SHOULD DEPEND ON WHICH GEOGRAPHY. I MEAN I AND AND SO -- I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO TO TO LOOK AT THINK ABOUT -- YEAH I LAST YEAR ACTUALLY THE LAST YEAR THE YEAR BEFORE I TO CHEER TO HEARING -- WILL LOOK AT THE STEINBERG US TO LOOKING AT DIFFERENT INNOVATIONS IN MENTAL HEALTH AND WE ARE SHE HEARD FROM THE MEDICAL DIRECTOR AND AND THE STATE OF NEW YORK AT AND I COULD DO IS GO WHILE. INSIDE BASICALLY WE DON'T HAVE MUCH OVERSIGHT OVER WHAT HAPPENS AND IN IN IN EACH COUNTY SO WELL I SAID MANY COUNTIES ARE DOING REALLY WONDERFUL THINGS. WE DO WE HAVE MINIMUM STANDARDS WE TO ACTUALLY APPRECIATE -- THE DOCTOR LISTEN YOU TALKED ABOUT -- YOU KNOW COMMON METRICS IN FACT LAST YEAR I HAD A BILL -- THAT SAID THAT MAYBE WHAT WE SHOULD DO THE OF A PROCESS TO ESTABLISH STATE MENTAL HEALTH GOALS. AND METRICS IT'S THERE'S ACTUALLY NO MANDATE TO THE COUNTY IS TO ACTUALLY HAVE TO DO ANYTHING FOR THE STATE MENTAL HEALTH GOALS BUT LEAST WE WOULD COLLECT STATEWIDE. A SET OF METRICS ON ON ON THESE A FEW ITEMS IN WHICH WE SAY WHAT WE WANT TRIED TO BEND THE CURVE ACROSS THE STATE AND STILL UP TO THE COUNTY HOW MUCH THEY WANT TO PUT INTO DOING THAT ARE NOT IN EITHER A DOING IT SO THEY'LL NEED. ANYMORE MONEY. BUT DOWN AT LEAST ALLOWS US TO TELL STATEWIDE STORY AND DEBT FOR EXAMPLE -- YOU KNOW -- THE OPIOID CRISIS RIGHT NOW I KNOW SOMETHING -- DOCKED WITH THIS -- STRUGGLING WITH IN HIS DISTRICT AT SOMETHING I THINK MANY OF US ARE STRUGGLING WITH. AS WELL. I I CAN'T SAY AND WE HAVE A HEARING ABOUT THAT SO WE'LL BE TALKING A LITTLE BIT LATER -- BUT I'M NOT SURE I CAN SAY WELL DO WE ACTUALLY HAVE. IF DIFFERENT COUNTY STORIES BUT WE HAD TO WE HAD HOW COME WE DESCRIBE OR STATEWIDE EFFORT IN TRYING TO TACKLE THAT IN TERMS ACCESS TO TREATMENT RIGHT -- SO -- SO WHAT ARE SOME THOUGHTS ABOUT -- IS IT THE BILL OF FORTUNATELY DID NOT PAY OKAY ACT WE CAN HAVE A PROCESS EVERY FIVE TO TEN YEARS WE STEP WISH. STATEWIDE MENTAL HEALTH GOALS SET A SET OF FIVE METRICS THAT PEOPLE THAT EVERY COUNTY HAS REPORT ON TO AT LEAST AND THEN THAT WAY WE WOULD HAVE THE ABLE TO TELL THE PEOPLE CALIFORNIA OVERALL. WE MADE PROGRESS WE DID MAKE PROGRESS ON THESE PARTICULAR GOALS AND PEOPLE NEED COUNTY CAN SAY ARE WE DOING ENOUGH IN OUR COUNTY TO TRY TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES AND THIS IS A PRIORITY IN OUR COUNTY SO CAN YOU SPEAK TO THAT. SURE SO I THINK -- A COUPLE OF THINGS IT'S NOT ED. I THINK WE HAVE SET OUT -- THE MEASURES THAT WE HAVE ON THE MENTAL HEALTH SIDE WE CERTAINLY ARE -- GETTING DATA FROM THE COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH PLANS AS IT RELATES -- TO THERE'S AN EQ RO SO EXTERNAL QUALITY REVIEW ORGANIZATION THAT HAS RESPONSIBILITY FOR GOING INTO THE COUNTIES THERE ARE A CONTRACTOR TO US BUT THEY GO OUT TO EACH OF THE COUNTIES. THEY'RE PULLING QUALITY DATA SO THEY'RE GOING INTO FILES AND BENEFICIARIES AND A MEASURING FOR CERTAIN OUTCOMES WE HAVE SOME -- DATA THAT WE TAKE TODAY BOTH ON A STATEWIDE BASIS AS WELL AS ON A COUNTY BASIS -- JUST LOOK AT METRICS I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF METRICS THAT HAVE NOT YET BEEN DEVELOPED AT A NATIONAL LEVEL AS IT PERTAINS -- TO MENTAL HEALTH -- I THINK PART -- IT'S MUCH MORE OF A QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE TYPE OF MEASURE AND IT REQUIRES -- CHART POLLS WHICH ARE OBVIOUSLY A LOT MORE DIFFICULT THAN USING ADMINISTRATIVE DATA WHICH WE GET AT THE STATE OBVIOUSLY FAIRLY WELL. I THINK -- WHEN WE TALK ABOUT OUTCOMES -- TWO OF THE TOOLS THAT WE HAVE RECENTLY AGREED TO USE -- AS IT PERTAINS TO THE USE POPULATION SO WE HAVE BOTH THE PSC WHICH IS THE PEDIATRIC SENTENCES CHECKLISTS AT FIRST AND CANS WHICH IS THE CHILD ADOLESCENT BEASTS AND STRENGTH THERE WE GO CHILD. SO I KNOW THE ACRONYMS BUT NOT WITH THE STAND -- FOR WE AS A DEPARTMENT SHOWS BOTH OF THOSE -- FOR USE IN THE MEDICAL POPULATION FOR ALL CHILDREN ARE GETTING SPECIAL TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES THROUGH THE COUNTIES THOSE ARE ASSESSMENT TOOLS BUT THEY ARE ALSO OUT WE ARE GOING TO BE USING THOSE FOR OUTCOMES DATA MEASUREMENTS -- THE COUNTIES I ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR REPORTING THAT DATA TO US IN AN AGGREGATED WAY SO I WOULD SAY THAT I'M A LOT OF THE INTERNAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND ADMINISTRATIVE MECHANICS. OF DOING BETTER DATA IS UNDER WAY AND IS IT FULLY -- DEMONSTRATING OUT COMES AT A BROAD LEVEL NO I THINK THAT DATA -- AND AS YOU CAN APPRECIATE COMING FROM A LARGE MEDICAL. CONGLOMERATE ITSELF IS IT SOMETIMES A LOT OF WORK TO GET THE SYSTEM SET UP AND THEN ONCE YOU DO AND YOU START TO SEE THE DATA YOU DO SOME VALIDATION AND YOU MAKE SURE THAT -- YOU'RE WORKING WITH THE PROVIDER OR THE PLAN IN THIS CASE TO STATE YOU KNOW THIS IS THE DATA WE GOT FROM YOU DOES THAT MAKE. SENSE AND THEY SAY OH IT DOESN'T LOOK RIGHT TO US LET US GO BACK AND TEST THE SYSTEM TO MAKE SURE THAT THE YOU KNOW THE METRICS ARE SET THE RIGHT WAY. SO I WOULD SAY -- SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE DONE OUR VERY MUCH GEARED TOWARDS LOOKING AT OUTCOMES I THINK THAT THE OTHER THINGS THAT WE'VE DONE AT THE STATE LEVEL. ABOUT TELLING OUR STORY FROM A A BROADER PERSPECTIVE -- GET DOWN TO THINGS LIKE THE WHOLE PERSON CARE PILOT IN WHICH WE HAVE BASICALLY PUSHED -- VARIOUS COUNTY ORGANIZATIONS TOGETHER AND SAID YOU NEED TO YOU NEED TO WORK TOGETHER TO IDENTIFY YOUR POPULATIONS THAT NEED THE MOST. CONSISTENT SUPPORTED COORDINATED THIS POPULATIONS CHOSEN BY THE COUNTIES ARE INDIVIDUALS WITH MENTAL ILLNESS -- OR HOMELESSNESS OR INCARCERATION -- ISSUES AND SO I THINK THAT A STATEWIDE LEVEL WE ARE WORKING TO DEVELOP THOSE DATA SYSTEMS TO DEVELOP THOSE RELATIONSHIPS -- BECAUSE YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO BUILD THE BASICS BEFORE YOU CAN THEN KIND OF GO TO THE NEXT YEAR IN TERMS OF EITHER SOPHISTICATION INNOVATION OR MORE YOU KNOW KIND OF COMPLICATED -- ANALYSIS IN TERMS OF OUTCOMES AND SO YOU KNOW IT IS A WORK IN PROGRESS AND I THINK THAT -- HAVING THE COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH PLANS TREATED IN A SIMILAR WAY AS OUR MEDICAL MANAGED CARE PLANS IN TERMS OF ENCOUNTER DATA SAID MISSION NETWORK FILENE'S ALL THE COMPLIANCE IS YOU'LL START TO SEE A GROWING -- KIND OF SOPHISTICATION AND HOW WE LOOK AT DATA AND THEN HOW THE COUNTIES ARE REPORTING IT TO US AND THEN THAT HELPS YOU KNOW CERTAINLY ANSWER QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE AROUND OUTCOMES. OKAY WELL I APPRECIATE THAT THERE'S PROGRESS BEING MADE THAT DATA AND MONITORING WHICH I KNOW THE DEPARTMENT DOES A LOT OF THIS ONLY. A PARTIAL STEP WE MENTION THE TO LINK THOSE TWO OUTCOMES IS THAT TELLING OUR STORY RIGHT AND THE WATER RESULTS AND ALSO SITTING. IDENTIFY WHAT OUR GOALS ARE SO THAT WE ARE ACTUALLY TRYING TO MEASURE METRICS THAT MATTER TO THOSE GOALS SO OTHERWISE WE GET METRICS BUT WE'RE NOT GERMAN ACTING ON THEM. I THINK THAT'S WHAT FINALLY -- I APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION ABOUT INTEGRATION -- TRYING TO INTEGRATE OUR MENTAL HEALTH WITH THE MEDIC HOW -- THE FOR BOTH OF YOU -- ACTUALLY JUST LAST WEEK LAST WEDNESDAY -- THE SENATE HEALTH COMMITTEE DID A HOLE HE I WOULD MAKE NOTE THAT -- WELL NOT EVERYONE ALWAYS AS AS I STILL MENTAL HEALTH IS GENERALLY A CHRONIC CONDITION -- WHICH FORTUNATELY WE DO NOT HAVE -- FOR MOST DENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS A TREATMENT THAT WITH. YOUR SOMEONE OF IT THAT SOMETHING THEY HAVE. TO THAT WE CAN MANAGE AN IMPROVING TREAT IT'S VERY TREATABLE FOR MANY PEOPLE BUT IT'S IT'S AN ONGOING ISSUE AND SO AS WE'RE LOOKING AT THAT -- DO YOU GET THAT MUCH BETTER OUTCOMES -- WITH INTEGRATION -- AND AND AS YOU NOTE DOES NOTED IN THE TESTIMONY -- HEALTH IS LINKED TO PHYSICAL HEALTH THE BRAIN IS NOT SEPARATE FROM THE REST OF THE BODY I MEAN I KNOW WE AT THIS WHOLE ARISTOTLE THING IN THE PAST ABOUT THAT -- BUT IT YOU KNOW THE BRAINIS IT AS A PHYSICAL ORGAN AS WELL AS AND AND SO THE THEY INTERACT AND OF COURSE WE TALK ABOUT SOCIAL TO TERMS OF HEALTH. SO -- WE'VE GOT TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO BETTER INTEGRATE AND I THINK WHEN WE LOOK AT OUR VARIOUS -- WAIVERS AND SO FORTH AND I KNOW OF TRADE THESE DIFFERENT MODELS AND WE TALK ABOUT THE HISTORY. OF AT SOME POINT. WE ARE HERE TODAY AND WE NEED TO LOOK TO THE STUDIES HISTORY -- YOU KNOW WE WE NEED RECOGNIZE IT BUT WE NEED TO MOVE BEYOND HISTORY TO AND SAY WHAT IS THE KIND OF MODEL WANT TO MOVE TOWARD AND NOT SIR STICK TO THE WHAT WE ALWAYS DONE IT THIS WAY SO WHICH CAN KEEP DOING IT THAT WAY -- SO WE NEED TO MOVE FORWARD ON ON THAT -- AND SO -- NO I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF WORK TO DO -- AND I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING BUT I I'D LIKE TO SEE MORE THINGS MOVING A BIT QUICKER AND NOW I THINK PEOPLE ARE KIND OF FRUSTRATED. WITH -- THE WITH WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW AND AND THE PROP SIXTY THREE MONEY -- WE KNOW THE NEED IS THERE BUT YET -- WHAT YOU KNOW A LOT OF -- AND COUNTIES WERE EVEN SOME THE COUNTIES ARE SITTING ON THE MONEY RIGHT. AND THEY WEREN'T GETTING IT OUT AND THAT THAT WAS FRUSTRATING -- AND YOU KNOW THAT THE ACTUALLY WE HAD THIS WHOLE DISCUSSION ABOUT HOW THE THE PART BECAUSE GOOD SERVICES TO GETS AN ALLOCATION PROP SIXTY THREE TO MONITOR HOW THE MONEY'S GOING TO THE COUNTIES WASN'T TRACKING THAT. AND YOU KNOW WHAT THEY WERE SPENDING AND SO NO THAT'S PASSED THAT'S PAST HISTORY NOW BUT WE WILL BE SURE WE KNOW WE TOLD PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE FUNDS THEY'RE OUT THERE BECAUSE PEOPLE THE VOTERS PASSED THAT MONEY EXPECTING THAT THINGS ARE GONNA BE DONE WITH THAT MONEY THAT. HAS HAPPENED IN SOME COUNTIES AND SOME OTHER PLACES IT HASN'T AND SO -- YOU KNOW WE NEED IT WE DO IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN PUBLIC TRUST WE NEED TO SHOW THAT WE'RE MAKING PROGRESS THAT THERE. THAT THAT THE DOLLARS ARE GIVING US ARE BEING USED AND BEING USED TO GOOD GOOD EFFECT IN THAT WE HAVE THAT STORY TO TELL BOTH LOCALLY AND STATEWIDE SO -- SO I I APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE I KNOW THAT MANY YOU BOTH OF YOU ARE DOING SOME SOME GOOD WORK BUT WHAT I THINK WE HAVE A WE NEED TO MOVE THE BEST. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND WANT -- TO LOOK AT THOSE SLIDE -- PAGE THREE THAT YOU BROUGHT UP FROM SOME OF THE AREAS WITH THEIR YOUTH. THAT ARE THERE AND AREAS IT NEEDS IMPROVEMENT -- IN IN YOLO COUNTY -- WE COME FROM -- IN SAN MARINO COUNTY WE WERE ABLE. TO START TO PUT TOGETHER DATA ON THE HOMELESS YOUTH POPULATION THAT'S OUT THERE AND A LOT OF THIS AMIR'S THE INFORMATION THAT'S HERE NOW. ONE OF THE THINGS WE ALSO -- START TO MOVE FORWARD WITH IN IN THE JOSHUA TREE AREA IT WAS A CRISIS HE STABILIZATION UNITS -- BRICK AND MORTAR -- SO FREE FOR SOME OF THESE COMPONENTS INTO A DESTABILIZATION CRISIS AREA DESTABILIZING THEM ULTIMATELY -- LAW ENFORCEMENT THE EMERGENCY ROOMS -- THE IMPACTS THAT WERE BEING DONE THERE WE'RE NOW -- MINIMIZE BECAUSE OF THAT SO. SEEN THAT THERE'S SUCH A AN AREA WITH OUR OUR OUR YOUNG PEOPLE ARE OUR YOUTH. IN AGES YOU KNOW FROM K. THROUGH TWELVE ALL THE WAY TO TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE THOSE AGES IN THAT AGE GROUP THAT I THINK WE NEED TO HAVE A A A BETTER FOCUS ON SOME OF THOSE THINGS. DO YOU THINK THAT THE CRISIS STABILIZATION UNITS -- IF THEY'RE CONSTRUCTED IN AREAS WOULD SERVE TO THAT ROLE AS FAR AS LOOKING AT THE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUE IT AND SELL. I WILL SAY THE STATURE CALIFORNIA SO NOT JUST YOLO COUNTY SO IN A WHITE THIS IS THE ISSUE -- I THINK CRISIS STABILIZATION UNITS HAVE APLACE IN CERTAIN COMMUNITIES. I I THINK A BETTER INVESTMENT OF OUR RESOURCES WOULD BE TO GET BEFORE ANYBODY EVER GETS TO THE COULD. POINT TO GET FARTHER UPSTREAM AND TAKE CARE OF THEM EARLIER BEFORE THEY END UP IN CRISIS AND I I I THINK WE HAVE SOME MODELS AND SOME -- EXAMPLES OF HOW TO DO THAT THOSE CRISIS STABILIZATION UNITS ALTOGETHER BUT I DO THINK WE HAVE SOME -- OPPORTUNITIES FOR MORE UPSTREAM INVESTMENT TO KEEP OUR CHILDREN ARE YOU SOUND ARE ADULTS FROM GETTING INTO THAT CRISIS SITUATION. SO YOU THINK MOVING. IN TOGETHER IN UNISON SO SOME OF THESE -- DIFFERENT PROGRAMS BECAUSE WE SEE IT OF A LOT OF THAT HAPPENING -- IN OUR COMMUNITIES NOW WITH THEM THE MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS AND DIFFERENT THINGS THAT ARE GOING ON IN OUR COMMUNITIES. I'M CRISIS STABILIZATION -- AREAS AS WELL AS PREVENTIVE AT A EARLY AGE AND EARLY -- IN SOMEONE'S EARLY LIFE. ANY OTHER YES. THANK YOU CHRIS -- I WOULD ASK ABOUT WHAT YOUR EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN. WITH REGARDS TO THE UNDOCUMENTED COMMUNITY ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH -- WHETHER -- THERE'S OBVIOUSLY DIFFERENCES AND AND WHO IS ELIGIBLE MONTHS THEY UNDOCUMENTED. BUT AND WHAT CAN BE DONE. TO IMPROVE. JUST LIKE OVERALL FOR MEDI CAL BUT WHAT CAN WE DO TO IMPROVE -- MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES TO THE UNDOCUMENTED COMMUNITY SURE GREAT QUESTION -- SO -- YOU KNOW FIRST AS ALL CHILDREN REGARDLESS OF DOCUMENTATION STATUS UP THROUGH THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN ARE ELIGIBLE FOR FULL SCOPE MEDICAL BENEFITS I THINK WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY -- IMPORTANT BECAUSE THAT CERTAINLY GUARANTEES THOSE CHILDREN HAVE ACCESS TO THE FULL RANGE OF MEDI CAL ENTITLEMENT SERVICES INCLUDING SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. I'M OBVIOUSLY AS PART OF THE GOVERNOR'S INCREASING THAT ELIGIBILITY UP TO THE AGENT THROUGH THE AGE OF TWENTY FIVE FOR INDIVIDUALS WITHOUT -- SATISFACTORY DOCUMENTATION STATUS IS ANOTHER POPULATION THAT WILL BE -- ABLE TO USE THE FULL SCOPE OF THE SPECIAL TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES EITHER IF THEY'RE AT UNDER THE AGE OF TWENTY ONE OR IF THERE OVER THE AGE OF TWENTY FIVE TWENTY ONE I THINK -- THE ONE OF THE MORE NOTABLE THINGS ABOUT CALIFORNIA -- IS THE FACT THAT WE HAVE -- TAKEN A LOT OF STEPS OVER THE COURSES -- TIME TO ADOPT DIFFERENT FINANCING -- MECHANISMS TO SUPPORT STATE GOALS AND THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT IS CERTAINLY ONE OF THOSE IN WHICH THE FUNDS THAT FLOW TO THE COUNTIES -- THROUGH AN HSA ARE SAYS AND SUPPORT -- DIRECT SERVICES AND SUPPORT THOSE FUNDS ARE NOT AND TIED TO MEDI CAL ELIGIBILITY PER SE THEY CAN BE USED ON OTHER POPULATIONS AND SO. I WOULD PROBABLY DEFER TO I'M KAREN FOR YOU KNOW KIND OF SPECIFICS AROUND WHAT THE COUNTIES ARE USING WITH THOSE FUNDS BUT THERE ARE A VARIETY OF FLEXIBLE FUND SOURCES SO THAT IF AN INDIVIDUAL. THAT IS UNDOCUMENTED -- COMES TO A COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH -- PROGRAM AND SAYS I'M IN NEED OF MEDICAL SERVICES THEY CAN USE OTHER FUN SOURCES THAT ARE NOT RELATED -- TO MEDI CAL ENTITLEMENT FUNDS I THINK ALSO -- FOR INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE IN A QUEUE CRISIS AND IN NEED OF INPATIENT SERVICES THERE ARE ON CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH THE STATE WOULD BE PAIN UNDER LIMITED SCOPE EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES ESPECIALLY IF SOMEONE HAD -- SOMETHING AS SERIOUS AS LIKE A FIFTY ONE FIFTY DESIGNATION AND WERE HARM TO THEMSELVES OR TO SOMEONE ELSE AND SO. IT'S NOT -- IDEAL AND I THINK THAT THERE ARE STEPS THAT CALIFORNIA HAS BOTH TAKEN AND ARE PREPARING TO TAKE AROUND. INCREASING COVERAGE IN PROVIDING FULL SCOPE TO KAREN ON CHINESE PAY FOR A I'M SO GLAD SHE'S JUST DID USE AN HSA FUNDS TO FUND OUR LOCAL PROGRAM WHERE WE USE PROMO TORAS TO DO OUT REACH INTO OUR MIGRANT CAMPS AND IT'S ACTUALLY WITH OUR COMMUNITY HEALTH OUR LOCAL COMMUNITY. HEALTH CENTER WHERE MANY OF OUR POPULATION WHO ARE UNDOCUMENTED ALREADY HAVE RELATIONSHIPS BECAUSE IT'S A MIGRANT HEALTH CENTER AND SO. IT NOT ONLY HAD THE BENEFIT OF FUNDING MEANT THE REAL HEALTH SERVICES BUT ALLOWED THEM TO HAVE NO STIGMA THEY CAN GO IN THE SAME DOOR TO SEE THEIR DOCTOR AS THEY SEE THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROVIDER. AND CULTURALLY THAT'S A LOT MORE APPROPRIATE THAN ASKING THEM TO COME TO MY BUILDING WHERE IF YOU GO THROUGH A CERTAIN DOOR EVERYBODY KNOWS WHERE THEY'RE IS THERE. IS THERE ANY CONNECTION AS FAR AS THE NEEDS -- AND OR ACCESS BETWEEN THE YOUTH HAVING ACCESS BUT NOT THOSE. OVER -- NINETEEN RIGHT NOW. NO THAT WAS IS IT IMPACT -- THEIR ABILITY OR THEIR MOTIVATION OR DO THEY FEEL. LIKE THEY SHOULDN'T TO GOAL -- HOW HAVE YOU SEEN ANY INDICATIONS OF? THE FACT THAT WE'RE SPLITTING UP YEAH. FAMILIES. FROM THOSE WHO ARE ELIGIBLE AND THOSE WHO ARE NOT. WELL AND I'M I'M NOT A CLINICIAN BUT I WILL CERTAINLY TRY TO PLAY ONE ON TV RIGHT AT THIS MOMENT -- I KNOW THAT -- TYPICALLY AND THEN A Q. PSYCHOTIC BREAK OR SCHIZOPHRENIA IS USUALLY DIAGNOSED WHEN SOMEONE IS IN THEIR LATE TEENS EARLY TWENTIES. I THINK THAT AND THIS IS NOT JUST TO THE UNDOCUMENTED POPULATION BUT TO ANY POPULATION AND CALIFORNIA THAT WE SERVE -- THE PTSD T. MANDATE AROUND SERVICES -- FOR CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF TWENTY ONE SO IN MEDI CAL THE PST T. BENEFIT IS A BROAD BENEFIT THAT SAYS ESSENTIALLY WE HAVE TO DO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO AMELIORATE ADDRESS. THE CONDITION -- AND SO THAT REALLY MEANS THAT THEY HAVE A LOT MORE SERVICES AVAILABLE TO THEM -- ESPECIALLY AROUND MENTAL HEALTH AND THEN WHEN THEY HIT THE AGE OF TWENTY ONE THAT MANDATE IS NO LONGER APPLICABLE AND MEDI CAL FOR ANY POPULATION AND SO. IN SOME CASES IT'S IT IS AN UNFORTUNATE RUBBED THAT INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE PROBABLY JUST BEING DIAGNOSED WITH A SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS WOULD ALSO BE AT THE POINT IN TIME IN WHICH THE MANDATE FOUR EPS DUE TO SOME SERVICES AND THOSE TYPES OF AVAILABILITY OF SERVICES. DISAPPEARS -- IF THEY'RE STILL MEDI CAL ELIGIBLE OBVIOUSLY THEY STILL ARE ACCESSING SERVICES BUT THE BROADNESS OF THAT BENEFIT IS REALLY KIND OF SPECIFIC AN INDICATIVE JUST TO TO CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF TWENTY ONE I THINK THAT -- JUST BY THE NATURE OF WE'LL SKIP SERVICES TO THIS POPULATION -- A IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE BOTH THE CHILD I'M A CERTAINLY AS THEY GET OLDER BUT ALSO THE PARENTS KNOW THAT THE SERVICES EXIST SOME OF THESE CHILDREN -- MAY FIRST ENCOUNTER A MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONAL IN THE SCHOOL SYSTEM WHICH I THINK WE HAVEN'T REALLY TALKED ABOUT -- BUT IF THE CHILD HAS A BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ISSUE OR SEER SUMMERS MOTION DISTURBANCE SOMETIMES THAT IS MANIFESTING IN THE SCHOOL SETTING. IN WHICH THE SCHOOL WITHIN REACH OUT TO THE COUNTY -- IN THERE WOULD BE A REFERRAL MADE -- AND THEN YOU WOULD THEN ALSO BEGAN TO HAVE SERVICES DELIVERED TO THE CHILD WHICH I THINK. TO THE EXTENT THAT WE AS A STATE HAVE SAID WE WILL SUPPORT AND FUND THAT SERVICE -- IT'S ALSO PARENT -- IMPORTANT FOR THE PARENTS TO KNOW THAT SUCH THAT THEY CAN MAKE SURE THAT THE CHILD IS ACCESSING THOSE SERVICES AS WELL AS WHEN THE CHILD. GROWS OLDER THEY KNOW THAT THEY STILL CONTINUE TO EXCESS. THANK YOU. I THINK GO WILL PRECEDE THE INFORMATION WE MAY HAVE SOME FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS AND WE'LL GET BACK TO YOU IN WRITING BUT IN THE INTEREST OF MOVING ALONG WE HAVE A WE HAVE TWO MORE PANELS SO. OUR NEXT PANELIST ON MENTAL HEALTH -- MEDI CAL MENTAL HEALTH COVERAGE FOR CHILDREN WE HAVE THREE SPEAKERS -- PLEASE COME ON FORWARD -- CAM LEWIS IS THE MANAGING ATTORNEY FOR THE NATIONAL HEALTH LAW PROGRAM. THE ANDHRA THE UNDER CLARK HARVEY IS DIRECTOR POLICY AND LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS FOR THE CALIFORNIA COUNCIL OF COMMUNITY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AGENCIES. SAY THAT ONE FAST THREE TIMES -- AND THEN FRANK MECCA'S EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION WITH ACID YOU TRY TO KEEP YOUR COMMENTS FIVE MINUTES OR SO. THAT'S GOOD THANK YOU SO MUCH. AND WE'LL START WITH HIM. GOOD AFTERNOON IT'S NICE TO BE HERE THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME -- IT'S I IT'S MY PRIVILEGE TO TALK ABOUT THE MANHOLE SERVICE DELIVERY SYSTEM IT'S SOMETHING THAT I IT'S NEAR AND DEAR TO MY HEART -- I HAVE BY WAY BACKGROUND BEEN WORKING IN THE MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM. IN ABOUT AN AROUND IT FOR ALMOST THIRTY YEARS -- I WORKED FOR A DECADE AS A PATIENT'S RIGHT TO HAVE A KID IN THE COUNTY AND SAN DIEGO COUNTY WHERE I WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR INSURING THE RIGHTS OF CHILDREN YOUTH AND ADULTS. ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES WERE DELIVERED. ALSO -- WASN'T LEAD COUNSEL IN A CLASS ACTION CASE ON BEHALF OF CHILDREN THE KD ES LAWSUIT. TO ENSURE THAT -- MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES WERE BEING DELIVERED ACCORDING TO THE PST TEAM MANDATE SO WE DEVELOPED HOME AND COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES FOR CHILDREN AND YOUTH IN CALIFORNIA. THAT'S BEEN IMPLEMENTED NOW AND ALSO WORK YOU KNOW DAILY WITH ADVOCATES AROUND THE STATE. BOTH -- YOU KNOW LEGAL SERVICES ADVOCATES -- SEE CLIENTS COME INTO THEIR OFFICE EVERYDAY WHO NEED ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND ARE HAVING DIFFICULTY GETTING THOSE SERVICES SO -- BECAUSE OF THE TIME YOU KNOW CONSTRAINTS ON I WANT TO LIMIT MY COMMENTS I'M GONNA FOCUS ON TWO SPECIFIC QUESTIONS. AND ONE IS THE FIRST ON WHAT NEEDS IMPROVING THE MEDI CAL MENTAL HEALTH DELIVERY SYSTEM. SO I LIKE TO YOU KNOW START WITH THAT QUESTION MY TALKING ABOUT A PARTICULAR EXAMPLE THAT I HAVE RECENTLY SEEN A CASE THAT. WAS BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION ITS ONGOING TODAY. A FIFTEEN YEAR OLD USE OF WHO HAS MULTIPLE MENTAL HEALTH DIAGNOSIS INCLUDING. DEPRESSION SUICIDAL IDEATION OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE DISORDER AS WELL AS SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER. IS GETTING SERVICES FROM HER HEALTH PLAN -- THROUGH AT AND IT AN EATING DISORDER SPECIALIST. ALSO HAS A PSYCHIATRIST TO THE COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH PLAN. HER CONDITION BECAME MUCH WORSE AND BOTH HER EATING DISORDER SPECIALIST AS WELL. AS THE PSYCHIATRIST RECOMMENDED THAT SHE GET RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT. SHE IN NOVEMBER SHE RECEIVED IT AND I'LL FORMER HEALTH PLAN BASICALLY SAYING THAT THEY WERE NOT RESPONSIBLE TO PROVIDE THAT SERVICE AND THAT SHE SHOULD GO TO THE COUNTY. THE MOTHER WENT TO THE COUNTY IN THE COUNTY AND ASK THEM FOR THE SERVICES. COUNTY SAID THEY COULD NOT PROVIDE THOSE SERVICES AND THAT SHE SHOULD GO TO THE HEALTH PLAN. SO THIS IS A NOVEMBER. TWENTY EIGHTEEN YOU KNOW NOW WE'RE HERE IN MARCH OF TWENTY NINETEEN AND ONLY OVER THREE AND A HALF MONTHS LATER STILL THOSE SERVICES HAVE NOT BEEN DELIVERED TO THAT CHILD. ANA IN IN THE INTERIM SHE HAS YOU KNOW SHOOT SOMEONE WHO IS BULIMIA ANOREXIA IS LOST ADDITIONAL FIFTEEN POUNDS HAS. REQUIRED EMERGENCY ROOM TREATMENT ON MULTIPLE OCCASIONS AND HAS BEEN INVOLUNTARILY DETAINED. SO YOU KNOW THIS IS UNFORTUNATELY NOT AN ANOMALY OF KINDS OF CASES THAT WE SEE -- YOU KNOW THESE ARE THE KINDS OF ISSUES THAT I THINK FACE USE AND AND CHILDREN EVERY DAY IN THE SYSTEM AS WELL AS ADULTS. IT'S NOT SURPRISING TO SAY THE SYSTEM IS FRAGMENTED YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT THAT. I THINK QUITE A BIT. THEY FINANCIAL INCENTIVES WHEN YOU BIFURCATED SYSTEM ARE TO DENY CARE AND TO REFER PEOPLE TO THE OTHER SYSTEM. THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS TODAY THAT IS BECAUSE OF THE DIFFERENT FUNDING STREAMS AND ACCOUNTABILITY THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS TO CHILDREN AND YOUTH IN PARTICULAR. IT'S NOT DESIGNED WITH BENEFITS YEARS AT THE CENTER OF THE SYSTEM -- YOU'VE KNOW THAT THEIR FIFTY SIX MENTAL HEALTH PLANS THERE ARE TWENTY TWO HEALTH PLANS ARE IN MULTIPLE COUNTIES -- THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES IS DIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE TO ENSURE THAT THIS ENTITLEMENT IS DELIVERED TO CHILDREN IN YEARS. AND THERE IS NOT ENOUGH OVERSIGHT OF MENTAL HEALTH PLANS AND HEALTH PLANS TO MAKE SURE THAT HAPPENS. THIS IS AN A FEDERAL ENTITLEMENT E. PST T. THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AND IT SHOULD NOT BE DELIVERED DIFFERENTLY IN EVERY COUNTY AND IT SHOULD NOT BE THAT YOU CAN GET A SERVICE AND ONE CAN YOU CAN GET IN AND OTHER. THAT IS NOT CONSISTENT WITH THE FEDERAL ENTITLEMENT [inaudible] SO. REALLY WHAT HAPPENS IS BENEFICIAL LEFT ON THEIR OWN AND IF THEY'RE LUCKY THEY GO TO A LEGAL SERVICES ATTORNEY AND MAYBE THAT I GET A CALL AND WE TRY TO WORK OUR WAY THROUGH THAT SYSTEM. THREE OF THE ISSUES I THINK I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THAT MAKE THIS MOST CHALLENGING ART. THEN LACK OF REFERRAL TRACKING BETWEEN THE PLANS. THE INADEQUATE COORDINATION AND THE LACK OR THE THE LACK OF ACCESS TO CONTINUITY OF CARE. SO JUST BRIEFLY. THE THERE IS NO REAL REQUIREMENT THAT. INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE BEING SURVIVAL SYSTEMS ARE BEING TRACKED AND THAT THAT. THAT THE THE INDIVIDUAL WHO IS BEING SEEN BY ONE IS ACT THEY ACTUALLY KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THE OTHER SYSTEM. THAT'S PARTLY DUE TO THE LACK OF REQUIREMENT THAT THEY TRACK IT'S ALSO DO THE FACT THAT THE DATA SYSTEMS ARE COMPLETELY INCOMPATIBLE. AND SO EVEN THOSE GOOD HEALTH PLANS THAT ARE ACTUALLY DOING TRACKING THEY'RE DOING IT MANUALLY. NOT AN AUTOMATED WAY AND SO NG IS THOSE YOU KNOW THEY'RE BASICALLY TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT SERVICES THOSE CHILDREN AND YOUTH ARE GETTING AND THEY OFTENTIMES DON'T KNOW WHAT THE OTHER SYSTEMS PROVIDING AYE MEANS NOT JUST HEALTH CARE BUT IT'S MENTAL HEALTH CARE -- SECONDLY THE IN TERMS OF AN ADEQUATE COORDINATION DESPITE THE FACT THAT THERE ARE REGULATIONS ON THE BOOKS. IN TITLE NINE THAT REQUIRE THAT THERE BE A MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN EACH PLAN IN EACH MENTAL HEALTH PLAN. THOSE MEMORANDUMS OF UNDERSTANDING ARE VERY DIFFERENT THEY'RE ALL VASTLY -- YOU KNOW A DIFFERENT IN TERMS OF BOTH THE AMOUNT AND THE TYPE OF COORDINATION THAT'S OCCURRING IN THE DETAIL THAT'S IN THOSE MENTAL. HEALTH MO USE WE'VE ANALYZED EVERYONE OF THEM IN A REPORT THAT WE DID IN NOVEMBER -- TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND SO AS A RESULT OF THAT THERE'S REALLY IN QUITE A BIT OF DIFFERENCE IN HOW THAT COORDINATION IS HAPPENING OR NOT HAPPENING. AND THAT LACK OF KIND OF CONTINUITY OF COORDINATION ESSENTIALLY MEANS THAT. PEOPLE ARE GOING FROM PLAN TO PLAN AND THERE REALLY ISN'T A HAND OFF IT'S LIKE OKAY YOU GET FROM ONE PLAN. AND YOU GET SET HANDED OFF TO THE OTHER PLAN AND THEY DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT HAPPENS AFTER THAT AND UNFORTUNATELY THAT MEANS THAT. PEOPLE ARE ENDING UP REALLY SCOTT BETWEEN THESE TWO SYSTEMS. SO -- KIND OF THIRD I WANT TO SAY THAT THE LACK OF CONTINUITY OF CARE SO PARTLY THAT'S DUE TO LACK OF TRACKING THAT WE JUST TALKED ABOUT THE LACK OF REFERRAL COORDINATION OF CARE -- IT LITERALLY LEADS TO PROBLEMS WITH CONTINUITY OF CARE SENSUALLY GET CAUGHT IN THE MIDDLE SO. THERE'S ALSO NO GUIDANCE BY THE DEPARTMENT REALLY IN THIS AREA THERE SOME RECENT GUIDANCE BUT IT'S REALLY NOT ENOUGH IN TERMS OF ENSURING THAT INDIVIDUALS AREN'T HAVING THEIR CARE. LAPS OR BEING INTERRUPTED IN THE MIDDLE OF TREATMENT SO. IT IN PARTICULAR THE EXAMPLE I GAVE YOU IS ABOUT WHERE THERE IS. A DISPUTE BETWEEN THE PLANS ABOUT WHO IS RESPONSIBLE AGAIN YOU'D THINK THAT THERE'D BE A WAY TO WORK THAT OUT WHAT HAPPENS IS THE BENEFITS YOU JUST LEFT CAUGHT IN THE MIDDLE EVEN THOUGH THEY CAN FILE A GRIEVANCE. THEY CAN USE THOSE LEGAL REMEDIES AVAILABLE TO THEM BUT BUT OFTEN TIMES IT DOESN'T RESOLVE THE PROBLEM AND YOU'VE GOT YOU KNOW YOU'VE GOT LAYERS OF KIND OF DUE PROCESS THAT YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH INCLUDING FAIR HEARING RIGHTS TO GET. TO A RESOLUTION WHICH TAKES MONTHS -- ALSO AT WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU HAVE NO CONTINUITY OF NETWORK. OF OF THE OF A NETWORK BETWEEN THE PLANS WHICH IS WHAT ALSO EXACERBATES THIS PROBLEM. YOU MAY END UP WITH A CHILD OR YOUTH BEING SERVED BY ONE SYSTEM AND HAVING LET'S SAY PSYCHOTHERAPIST AND THEN. HAVING TO BE SORT OF HANDED OFF TO ANOTHER SYSTEM WHICH SHOULD NOT HAPPEN AND START OVER WITH A NEW THERAPIST THAT'S NOT THE STANDARD PRACTICE THAT SHOULD BE HAPPENING TODAY -- JUST KIND OF FINALLY I THINK ON THIS ISSUE OF CONNIE DO CARE. THERE ARE ALSO THERE'S A STATE WAY THAT THEY HAVE DIVIDED UP RESPONSIBILITY BETWEEN PLANS WHICH YOU MAY HAVE HEARD ABOUT IN LESS HEARING AROUND MILD TO MODERATE TO SEVERE IMPAIRMENTS. THIS BILL -- I KNOW I'VE EXHAUSTED BILLY ADVOCATE ON THIS ISSUE BUT THERE SHOULD NOT BE APPLYING THIS REQUIREMENT TO CHILDREN. THIS IS THE ENTIRE APS SEED ENTITLEMENT IS VERY BROAD AND KIDS SHOULD NOT BE TURNED AWAY FROM CARE BECAUSE THEY HAVE A SEVERE IMPAIRMENT A MILD OR MODERATE IMPAIRMENT IT IS ABOUT WHAT'S MEDICALLY NECESSARY. AND WHAT HAPPENS IS THESE KIDS DO GET TURNED AWAY AND WE'VE SEEN THAT ROUTINELY IN PARTICULAR BY MENTAL HEALTH PLANS. THROUGH SCREENING MECHANISMS ARE OTHER WAYS OF DENYING KIDS CARE -- AT THE FRONT END BECAUSE THEY DON'T ALSO BECAUSE THE REGULATIONS THAT WE HAVE ON THE BOOKS AROUND MEDICAL NECESSITY ARE VERY CONVOLUTED AND THEY'RE IN CONSISTENT WITH THE STATUTE. FOR MEDICAL NECESSITY WHICH WE FIX LAST YEAR IN THE LEGISLATION -- THROUGH SB. TWELVE EIGHTY SEVEN SO HOW DO WE BETTER INTEGRATE THAT CERTAIN THOSE GET THAT CARE I MEAN I HAVE NOT COME TO THIS DECISION LIGHTLY BUT OVER MANY MANY YEARS OF BEING INVOLVED IN THE SYSTEM I HAVE. NOW TAKEN THE POSITION THAT I THINK A FULLY INTEGRATED SYSTEM IS THE DIRECTION THAT WE NEED TO GO IN. WE HAVE MANY MANY YEARS OF EXPERIENCE OF FRAGMENTED DELIVERY SYSTEM WE HAVE. AS YOU'VE HEARD EARLIER ON THE PANEL. YOU KNOW YOU SEEN ONE CAN YOU SEEN ONE COUNTY THAT IS NOT AN ENTITLEMENT THAT IS ABOUT A A FRAGMENTED SYSTEM THAT DOES NOT WORK. BUT IT IS GOING TO TAKE TIME TO GET THAT TO BE DONE RIGHT THERE'S GONNA NEED TO BE A VERY CAREFUL STAKEHOLDER PROCESS THERE'S GOING TO NEED TO BE GUARDRAILS PUT IN PLACE THERE'S GOING TO BE NEED TO BE. READING THE STANDARDS DEVELOPED AND IN PARTICULAR FOR CHILDREN AND YOUTH BECAUSE THE SERVICES. IN SPECIALTY MAHAL BUT CHILDREN YOUTH GET ARE VERY DIFFERENT THAN A MEDICAL MODEL TYPE OF SERVICE THAT'S DELIVERED AN OFFICER IN A CLINIC. THAT MOST OF THE HEALTH PLANS ARE FAMILIAR WITH IN A COMMERCIAL SIDE. THERE ARE HOME AND COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES THEY COULD BE PROVIDED ON THE SOCCER FIELD THAT COULD PROVIDE IN THE HOME. IT COULD BE PROVIDED IN THE SCHOOL. BUT THERE ARE SERVE AT TIMES AND THERE PROVIDED A LOT OF TIMES BY PARA PROFESSIONALS UNDER THE CLINICAL SUPERVISION. AND THOSE ARE SERVICES THAT ARE NOT EASY TO DELIVER THEIR FIDELITY PRACTICE THAT NEEDS TO BE LEARNED AND IT NEEDS TO BE CONTINUED SO. THAT THAT NETWORK NEEDS TO BE IN PLACE IF THEY'RE GOING TO BE -- MOVING UNDER THE AUTHORITY OR RESPONSIBILITY OF THE HEALTH PLAN. BUT WHAT WE CAN DO NOW IN SORT OF IT I'VE ALREADY TALKED ABOUT IS PUT IN PLACE SOME LEGISLATION THAT SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSES RIGHT NOW TODAY. THAT REFERRAL IN TRACKING SYSTEM BETTER COORDINATION REQUIREMENTS AND MORE ACCOUNTABILITY. AND ALSO -- TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS KIND OF THE OF CARE AND THAT'S GONNA REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT ACTUALLY DO MORE THAN IT'S DOING TODAY TO OVERSEE WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE STATE. IT IS NOT OKAY FOR THE STATE DEPARTMENT TO SAY WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT HAPPENS IN A PARTICULAR COUNTY BECAUSE A REALIGNMENT FUNDING OR ANY OTHER REASON IT IS A MEDICAID ENTITLEMENT AND THERE IS THE OTHER SINGLE STATE AGENCY RESPONSIBLE -- SO I BELIEVE IN MY WRITTEN TESTIMONY AND ALSO I'M OPEN FOR QUESTIONS GREAT THANK YOU AND WE'LL WE'LL TAKE QUESTIONS AT THE END SO. GO AHEAD DR KERR [inaudible] GOOD AFTERNOON. I'M WE UNDERTAKE HARVEY REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA COUNCIL FOR COMMUNITY BE EVER HOLD AGENCIES WE REPRESENT MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS -- NONPROFIT COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATION TO CONTRACT WITH COUNTY SAN THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE A SUMMARY OF OUR MEMBERS FEEDBACK OF WHAT'S WORKING WELL AND AREAS OF IMPROVEMENT FOR CHILDREN'S MEDICAL SERVICES. SO GENERALLY LET'S START OFF WITH THE POSITIVE ARE PROVIDERS APPRECIATE WHEN THINGS WORK WALL THEY CAN WORK WITHIN A COMPREHENSIVE SYSTEM OF CARE THAT IS TAILORED TO THE POPULATION THAT SERVED. IN INCLUDES ACCESS TO CARE ELEMENTS SUCH AS NO COPAY A WIDE ARRAY OF SERVICES AND IT REIMBURSES PROVIDERS FOR THEIR TOTAL CLINICAL AND CASE MANAGEMENT TIME. BUT THEY SEE OPPORTUNITIES FOR IMPROVEMENT AS FOLLOWS THE CURRENT COST REIMBURSEMENT SYSTEM IS VERY RESTRICTIVE FOR EXAMPLE THE MINUTE BY MINUTE BILLING DOES NOT INCENTIVIZE PROVIDERS TO FOCUS ON VALUE BASED CARE AND OUTCOMES AS MISS LARSEN NOTED IN HER OPENING COMMENTS. FOR EXAMPLE IT ALSO DISK DIFFICULT TO GET MENTALLY ILL CHILDREN THE RESIDENTIAL CARE WHEN NEEDED AT THIS POPULATION REQUIRES MULTIPLE SERVICES AND RESOURCES AND IT'S QUITE BURDENSOME ON PROVIDERS. WHEN WE LOOK AT SCHOOL BASED MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT TING SILOS SO THAT ALL STUDENTS ARE ABLE TO GET THE SERVICES FOR THEIR BEHAVIOR AND EDUCATION NEED REGARDLESS OF INSURANCE OR MEDICAID ELIGIBILITY? AND OVERWHELMINGLY OUR PROVIDER SHARE CONCERNS ABOUT BURDEN SOME CLINICAL CHARTING STANDARDS AND THE NEED FOR PAPERWORK REDUCTION AND UNIFORMITY AND PAPERWORK STANDARD ACROSS ALL OF THE COUNTY OF LOS THE TRANSITION FROM IN A CHILDREN'S MEDICAL -- MEDICAL EXCUSE ME MEDICAL TWO ADULTS SERVICES WHEN THEY TURN TWENTY ONE CAN BE REALLY ABRUPT AND WARRANTS BETTER CONTINUITY OF CARE. AS WAS JUST MENTIONED. NO ONE WE EXAMINE THE MENTAL HEALTH PLANS PROVIDERS DESIRE BETTER COORDINATION BETWEEN COUNTY MH PEAS ONE CLIENTS MOVE BETWEEN COUNTY SERVICES ARE OFTEN DROPPED OR DELAYED AS WAS NOTED DURING THIS LIST OF TESTIMONY. AND THEY'RE ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT THE CURRENT SYSTEM'S INABILITY TO GET A FIX CLIENTS WAS FINDING A PROVIDER WHEN THEY NEED A LOWER LEVEL OF KERR WHEN THEY'RE DOING WELL. MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS TYPICALLY HAVE FEWER LOCATIONS AND THEY DON'T ALWAYS PROVIDE ROBUST COMMUNITY BASED SERVICE HAS. SO IT'S CLEAR TO ALL OF US THAT THE INTEGRATION OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND PHYSICAL HEALTH IS ESSENTIAL. I IN FACT THE CALIFORNIA HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION RELEASED A REPORT JUST LAST MONTH THAT FOCUSED ON THIS GOAL. TO THIS AND WE BELIEVE THAT THE STATE MONTHS FIRST FUND PILOT PROGRAMS THAT TEST THE INTEGRATION OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND PHYSICAL HEALTH AND COMMUNITY BASED SETTINGS. WE ALSO THINK THAT STATES AND COUNTY SHOULD INVEST MORE IN HEALTH IN OUR INFORMATION EXCHANGES AND PROVIDE THESE TO CBO'S SO THAT AN INDIVIDUAL'S COLLECTIVE ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORD PLATFORM CAN SHARE INFORMATION WHEREVER THEY GO FOR TREATMENT. WE ALSO BELIEVE IN BROADENING THE DEFINITION OF MEDICAL NECESSITY FOR CHILDREN. IF THE STATE VIEW CHILDREN'S ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES THE SAME WAY WE VIEW PHYSICAL HEALTH VACCINATIONS MORE KIDS WOULD GET SERVICES REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY MEET MEDICAL NECESSITY CRITERIA. I KNOW TIME IS SHORT PSALTIS AND WITH A QUOTE FROM ONE OF OUR PROVIDERS. COUNTY AGENCIES ARE STAFFED BY ESPECIALLY THE PROGRAM OFFICIALS AND STAFF THAT WE KNOW AN INTER INTERACT WITH HOWEVER BY THE VERY NATURE OF LARGE GOVERNMENT ENTITIES. IT'S INEVITABLE THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE AND INEFFICIENCIES BUT PROVIDERS HAVE THE ABILITY TO BE MORE RESPONSIVE TO THE NEEDS OF CLIENTS BY SCALING AND ADJUSTING SERVICES IN A NUMBER OF FASHION. SO COUNTY AGENCIES AND PROVIDERS NEED TO WORK TOGETHER THEIR NATURAL PARTNERS THEY CAN REALLY ENRICH OUR COMMUNITIES YET WE CONTINUE TO CRY OUT FOR THE ABILITY AND PERMISSION TO JUST BE MORE EFFICIENT. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE COMMENTS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER MAKER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN FRANK MECCA THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION. OUR MEMBERS ADMINISTER MOST OF THE PUBLICLY FUNDED HUMAN SERVICES PROGRAMS INCLUDING FOSTER CARE CHILD WELFARE SERVICES AND CAL WORKS IN OUR WINDOW. INTO -- THE ISUE TODAY IS THROUGH CHILDREN THAT ARE THE CLIENTS OF OUR AGENCIES HAVE SUFFERED SIGNIFICANT TRAUMA. CHILDREN HAVE SUFFERED ABUSE AND NEGLECT IN CHILDREN WHO ARE LIVING IN POVERTY OFTEN VERY DEEP POVERTY WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE CHILDREN IN OUR SYSTEM. A 100% OF THE CHILDREN IN UP IN THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM HAVE EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT TRAUMA. NOT JUST FROM THE ABUSE AND NEGLECT THE BECAUSE THE INTERVENTION BUT FROM THE REMOVAL ITSELF AND BEING PLACED -- IN OUT OF HOME CARE. ON CHILDREN AND CAL WORKS FAMILIES LIVE EXPERIENCE MULTIPLE TRAUMAS IN CALIFORNIA ALMOST 20% 21%. OF CHILDREN LIVE IN POVERTY IN ANOTHER 25% ARE LIVING NEAR THE POVERTY LINE. AND WE DO KNOW THAT LEFT UNTREATED TRAMMELL HAVE A LIFELONG IMPACT ON THEIR BRAIN DEVELOPMENT AND THAT OFTEN LEADS TO CHRONIC HEALTH CONDITIONS AND OTHER POOR OUTCOMES. THAT ARE VERY COSTLY TO SOCIETY. NATIONAL STUDIES FIND THAT 70% OF FOSTER CHILDREN HAVE SIGNIFICANT MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS YET COMPARATIVELY FEW ARE BEING MEANING FULLY SERVED. AND OUR CURRENT SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM -- AND I WOULD POINT OUT SOMETHING THAT -- AT THE LAST HEARING MUCH THERE WAS MUCH DISCUSSION ABOUT PENETRATION RATES -- THE PENETRATION RATE ON THE DEFINITION OF IT IS ONE CONTACT A YEAR AND THAT CONTACT COULD BE AN ASSESSMENT. AND THE FINDING THAT THE CHILD IS NOT ELIGIBLE FOR ANY FURTHER SERVICES. SO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WORK WITH ADVOCATES TO COME UP WITH AN ENGAGEMENT TRAIT IT'S FIVE CONTACTS YEAR. AND IT REALLY REFLECTS MORE MEANINGFUL ENGAGEMENT WITH THE SYSTEM [inaudible] I IN -- CALIFORNIA 36% OF FOSTER KIDS STATEWIDE MEET THE ENGAGEMENT RATE -- IT'S DECLINING IT VERY SIGNIFICANTLY FROM COUNTY TO COUNTY. THAT'S COMPARED TO NATIONAL STUDIES THAT SUGGEST THAT 70% OF KIDS. IN FOSTER CARE HAD SIGNIFICANT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH NEEDS. FOR ALL CHILDREN NOT JUST FOSTER% CHILDREN FOR ALL CHILDREN ON MEDI CAL THE SPECIALTY MAIL HELP PENETRATION RATE IS ABOUT 4%. THE ENGAGEMENT RATE IS ABOUT 3% AND BOTH ARE DECLINING -- OFTEN MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES HAVE BEEN SERVED UNDER TRADITIONAL MEDICAL MODEL THAT MY COLLEAGUES HAVE TALKED ABOUT FOR KIDS IN THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM IN KIDS OF EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT TRAUMA. THE FIFTY MINUTE OFFICE VISIT IN A CLINICAL SETTING IS NOT WHAT MAKES SENSE FOR THEM THEY MORE OFTEN BENEFIT FROM SOCIAL MODEL COMMUNITY AND HOME BASED SERVICES THAT ARE DELIVERED IN THE CONTEXT OF THE COMMUNITIES. WHERE WE NOT JUST TREAT THE NEEDS OF THE CHILD BUT WE SIMULTANEOUSLY SUPPORT THE NEEDS OF THE CARE GIVERS? THERE ARE VERY FEW MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF EIGHT DESPITE WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE IMPACTS OF TRAUMA ON YOUNG DEVELOPING BRAINS. SO FROM THAT STANDPOINT OF THE SYSTEM THAT ENGAGES IN KIDS AT ITS SUFFERED SIGNIFICANT TRAUMA WHAT WE NEED -- OUR KID NEEDS KIDS NEED SERVICES TIMELY. I NEED SERVICES DELIVERED IN THE CONTEXT OF THEIR FAMILIES AND THEIR COMMUNITIES -- AND WE NEED SUPPORT FOR CARE GIVERS SO THAT THEY CAN HELP CHILDREN HE'LL NOT JUST THE CLINICIAN -- THAT'S TREATING THEM. AND WE NEED A FULL CONTINUUM OF SERVICES EARLY INTERVENTION ALL THE WAY TO ALTERNATIVES TO HOSPITALIZATION. THE GOOD NEWS IS WE KNOW MORE ABOUT ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES AND TRAUMA WE KNOW WHAT WORKS -- BASED ON DECADES OF RESEARCH INCLUDING RESEARCH BY THAT RECENTLY APPOINTED SURGEON GENERAL WE KNOW A LOT ABOUT THE IMPACT OF ACES -- WE KNOW THE WRAPAROUND PROGRAMS WITH FAMILIES -- THAT WE WE SEE IN PLACES IN THE STATE WORK FOR FOSTER KIDS WE KNOW THAT PEER SUPPORT BASE SERVICES THAT ARE OFTEN -- DELIVERED IN SCHOOL SETTINGS OR OR IN HOME BASE SETTINGS OR OR INTEGRATED WITH OTHER COMMUNITY BASED CHILD SERVING AGENCIES WORK -- YOU -- HEARD ABOUT SCHOOL BASED SO -- SERVICES IN MONTEREY COUNTY FOR EXAMPLE YOU HEARD ABOUT SOME. ON SERVICES THAT ARE BEING DONE IN YOLO COUNTY WHICH IS IT DOING EXCELLENT THINGS SO WE WE KNOW WHERE THINGS WORK THE OTHER GOOD NEWS IS THAT THE PST T. THE FEDERAL ENTITLEMENT. CAN COVER A MUCH BROADER ARRAY OF SERVICES CONSISTENT WHAT WHAT WITH WHAT WE KNOW KIDS NEED. IT'S NOT CAPPED -- THE FEDERAL EXPECTATION IS THAT ANY KID THAT'S ELIGIBLE RECEIVE SERVICES. AND CHILDREN UNDER A P. P. STT ARE ENTITLED TO CONDITION FOR WHICH THE CHILD MEETS MEDICAL NECESSITY REGARDLESS OF WHETHER IT'S CURRENTLY IN THE STATE PLAN. AND PREVENTION IS EXPLICITLY AN EXPECTATION IN THE FEDERAL ENTITLEMENT. SO HOW DO WE HOW DO WE GET THERE FROM HERE -- OUR FIRST RECOMMEND A DACIAN IS THE STATE CAN BE MORE INTENTIONAL BALL INTENTIONAL ABOUT FULLY ARTICULATING THE ARRAY OF SERVICES. THAT WE ALL EXPECT TO SEE IF WE'RE GOING TO BE FOR FILLING THE FEDERAL ENTITLEMENT -- WE NEED TO EXPAND A REYES -- TO FROM EARLY PREVENTION -- THROUGH ALTERNATIVES TO HOSPITALIZATION AND WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT WAYS TO CODIFY THOSE EXPECTATIONS IN ALKHAN MONITORING SYSTEMS AND PERHAPS AND STATUTES AND REGULATIONS. WE DESPERATELY NEED TO MODERNIZE THE DEFINITION OF MEDICAL NECESSITY. ONE REASON GAUGE MEANT RATES AND PENETRATION RATES ARE SO OUR LOW IS THAT WE HAVE A DEFINITION OF MEDICAL NECESSITY THAT IT'S TOO OFTEN A BAR NOT MATT. MY CHILDREN HAVE EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT TRAUMA AND MODERNIZING OUR NOTIONS OF WHAT IS MEDICAL NECESSITY SO THAT WE CAN LEARN FROM DECADES OF RESEARCH ABOUT TRAUMA I THINK WOULD. WOULD EXPAND SERVICES TO A BROADER ARRAY OF OUR OF OUR POPULATION. THE LEGISLATURE'S CREATED BUILDING BLOCKS TO DO JUST THAT YOU PASSED AB THREE FORTY TO REQUIRE SCREENING FOR TRAUMA FOR EVERY KID. IN MEDI CAL AND YOU PASSED SB TWELVE EIGHTY SEVEN AS MY COLLEAGUE POINTED OUT WHICH REQUIRES THE STATE TO UPDATE THE DEFINITION OF MEDICAL NECESSITY -- I THINK AS A STATE WE NEED TO BE MORE INTENTIONAL INTENTIONAL ABOUT PROVIDING TRAINING AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO COUNTY SOME PROVIDERS. SO WE COULD TAKE THOSE EXCELLENT POCKETS AND AND WHAT WE KNOW THAT WORKS. AND MAKE MAKE IT BROADLY X. AND IN FACT FULFILL THE INTENTION AND THAT'S THE SPIRIT IN THE LAW. THAT -- THAT CHILDREN WHO ARE ENTITLED TO THOSE SERVICES RECEIVE THEM MY COLLEAGUES HAVE TALKED ABOUT WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AND I WON'T -- SAY ANYTHING MORE ABOUT THAT HERE OTHER THAN THIS IS AN ISSUE NOT JUST ABOUT CHILD PSYCHIATRISTS. THAT IS THAT THAT IS AN AREA WHERE WE NEED TO IMPROVE THE WORK FORCE BUT WE NEED TO IMPROVE THE WORK FORCE FOR PARA PROFESSIONALS PSYCHIATRIC NURSES PURE PARTNERS AND OTHER COMMUNITY BASED PROVIDERS. PERHAPS MOST SIGNIFICANTLY I THINK WE CAN DO A BETTER JOB AND HOW WE USE DATA TO OVERSEE AND CONTINUALLY IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF OUR PROGRAMS. IN THE CHILD WELFARE PROGRAM AND SOON IN THE COW WORKS PROGRAM WE HAVE A DATA DRIVEN OUTCOME BASED OVERSIGHT SYSTEM -- THAT WE CAN LEARN FROM. IF WE ASK HOW DO WE KNOW HOW THE KIDS ARE DOING IN THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM. AT ANY MOMENT YOU CAN LOG ONTO A PUBLICLY AVAILABLE WEBSITE MANAGED BY UC BERKELEY AND YOU CAN SEE BY QUARTER BY COUNTY. HOW KIDS IN THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM ARE DOING ARE THEY BEING REUNIFIED TIMELY ARE THEY BEING REVIEW ARE THEY BEING RE ABUSED WHILE THEY'RE IN CARE? EITHER ADOPTIONS BEING PERFORMED IN A TIMELY BASIS OUR COUNTY WORKERS MEETING THEIR MONTHLY VISITATION REQUIREMENTS. THAT INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE BY COUNTY BY QUARTER IN ITS STRATIFIED BY A WHOLE HOST OF DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS -- OF OF YOUTH. BOMB THAT THE AVAIL QUALITY IMPROVEMENT YOU DON'T PENALIZE COUNTIES YOU EXPECT THAT COUNTIES USE THAT DATA FOR SELF REFLECTION AND SELF IMPROVEMENT. AND THAT CONTINUOUS GUADALUPE QUALITY IMPROVEMENT APPROACH THAT'S NOT PUNITIVE -- BUT BUT AS I SAID IT'S ABOUT QUALITY IMPROVEMENT I THINK THERE ARE LESSONS THAT WE CAN LEARN TO BUILD ON WHAT DIRECTOR CANS TALKED ABOUT AS EXISTING STATE PROGRAMS. TO BETTER USE THE DATA THAT WE HAVE -- SOME SOME -- OUTCOME MEASURES THAT WE MIGHT THINK ABOUT IMPROVE SCHOOL IN BAY AT PERFORMANCE. OUT EDUCE SUICIDE RATES FOSTER CHILDREN REUNIFYING WITH THEIR FAMILIES. I WOULD LIKE TO SECOND THIRD AND FOURTH THAT THE NEED FOR SIMPLIFICATION AND BILLING OUR COLLEAGUES ARE SPENDING WAY TOO MUCH TIME. ON A REALLY BYZANTINE REALLY UNPRODUCTIVE -- BILLING -- BILLING SYSTEM WE NEED TO MAXIMIZE THE RECEIPT OF FEDERAL FUNDING UNDER EP STT ITS BROAD -- IT SUPPORTS MANY THINGS -- THAT THAT MOST THINGS THAT CHOI SHOULD EXAMINE THE X. THAT -- SUFFICIENCY OF FUNDING IF THERE ARE GAPS BETWEEN WHAT CHILDREN NEED AND WHAT WE HAVE REASONABLY AVAILABLE THE STATE SHOULD THINK ABOUT WAYS TO WORK WITH COUNTIES TO FILL IN THOSE GAPS. AND FINALLY WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT RISK SHARING -- IF WE SIMPLIFY BILLING AND WE DO BETTER TRAINING AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE ON HOW TO DO BILLING AND HOW TO COMPLY WITH AUDITS IN AN INCREASINGLY CAPRICIOUS FEDERAL GOVERNMENT NONE THE LESS -- MAKES AUDIT EXCEPTIONS AND COUNTIES HAVE DONE THE RIGHT THING. I'M AND WE HAVE IN GOOD FAITH DELIVERED IMPORTANT SERVICES AND WE GET INAPPROPRIATE LEADING -- BY A FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT HAS AN ANTI CALIFORNIA BIAS -- THE COUNTY SHOULD BE INDEMNIFIED FROM THE RISK OF THAT IF IF IF THE EXPECTATION ON COUNTIES IS BE MORE ACCOUNTABLE ABROAD IN THE RAY OF SERVICES. I MEAN REALLY STEP UP UP THE DELIVERY THE STATE REALLY NEEDS TO HAVE OUR BACK -- IN TERMS OF MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE NOT INAPPROPRIATELY. PENALIZED ON BECAUSE THAT'S FUNDING THAT COULD BE USED FOR SERVICES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- QUESTIONS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATIONS -- I KNOW I KNOW THAT -- DEFINITION MEDICAL NECESSITY IN THE PST TEASE CAM OUT BUT QUITE FREQUENTLY AND ALL YOUR TESTIMONY EVEN THE PREVIOUS TESTIMONY. I KNOW WE HAD SB AS A TWELVE EIGHTY SEVEN WHICH SETS A GOAL OF THE STAB WISHING YOU DEFINITIONS BY TWENTY TWENTY TWO IS THERE A WAY WE COULD DO THAT FASTER ARE. KEYS TO I MEAN I'M HERE I WILL SAY LIKE THIS IS A BIG PROBLEM SO. WHAT WE DO TO MOVE ON IT MORE QUICKLY WE DID PASSED LEGISLATION LAST YEAR? IF I COULD I'D JUST LIKE TO CLARIFY THE SINS WERE THE SPONSORS OF THAT LEGISLATION THAT. THE GOAL OF THAT LAW WAS TO ENSURE THAT STATE LAW WAS CONSISTENT WITH THE FEDERAL LAW WHICH IS. ENOUGH YOU KNOW US CODE -- THAT REGULATIONS AND GUIDANCE ARE UPDATED TO BE CONSISTENT WITH THAT BECAUSE AS I MENTIONED EARLIER A LOT OF OUR REGULATIONS ARE VERY OLD AND CONVOLUTED AND THEY ADD IN. A WHOLE LAYER OF COMPLICATION ON TOP OF THE FEDERAL LAW WHICH IS UNNECESSARY AND CREATES -- BURDEN IN ACCESSING CARE IF WE'RE GONNA BROADEN IT BE ON THE FEDERAL LAW THAT WOULD OBVIOUSLY BE ON THE STATE TO PAY FOR BUT I YOU KNOW CERTAINLY I'M NOT STANDING IN THE WAY OF THAT. PLAN. OKAY SO GIVEN THE FACT WE PASS IT ON TO RECALL EXACTLY THE DETAILS I MEAN SO WHAT NGUYEN. SO I ASSUME THAT THE THE SOURCE WEEKS AWAY SOME OLD STATE REGULATIONS AND SO FORTH SO THAT PLACE RIGHT NOW OR WHAT WHAT WENT WENT WENT IS CHANGE GONNA HAPPEN. WELL THE LAWS IN PLACE NOW RIGHT THE REGULATIONS CAN BE ELIMINATED NOW AND WE'VE ASKED THE DIRECTOR TO DO THAT BECAUSE THE IT GIVES THEM THE AUTHORITY. I'M NOT LISTENING THE APA TO ISSUE GUIDANCE BEFORE THE REGULATIONS ARE ISSUED IN TWENTY TWENTY BY TWENTY TWENTY TWO IS TO MENTION. SO THAT COULD BE DONE TODAY THROUGH A A GUIDANCE ALL COUNTY LETTER OR MENTAL HEALTH. S. CDS LETTER SUCH. YES DR I ALSO THINK THAT IN ADDITION TO MODERNIZING THE DEFINITION AND REGULATIONS WE REALLY NEED TO THINK ABOUT TRAINING AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE BECAUSE WE DO HAVE A SITUATION WHERE THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF VARIATION ABOUT WHETHER A SIMILARLY PRESENTING CHILD. WOULD MEET MEDICAL NECESSITY IN ONE COUNTY AS OPPOSED TO ANOTHER COUNTY. AND SO THAT'S NOT BECAUSE COUNTIES DON'T WANT TO SERVE KIDS -- IT'S DEFINITIONS HAVE NOT BEEN THAT WE NEED TO BE INTENTIONAL AS A STATE WITH A COUNTIES IN PARTNERSHIP WITH YOU -- TO TO EXPAND ON TRAINING AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO MAKE MORE CONSISTENT THAT -- THE RESULTS OF THE APPLICATION OF THE MEDICAL NECESSITY TEST. OKAY AND I KNOW -- THE DIRECTOR OF DHS IS NOT ON THE PANEL BUT I DO SEE HER IN THE AUDIENCE SO HOPEFULLY WE CAN GET A TIME LINE ON WHEN WE WILL. FIX THOSE REGULATIONS. AND I UNDERSTAND IT COULD BE DONE VERY SHORTLY. ACCORDING TO LAW THAT WE PASSED OKAY -- SEND A REVIEW. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR ALL THE INFORMATION YOU PROVIDED -- I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS I KNOW I'VE HEARD IT FROM ALL OF YOU KNOW ARE YOUR PRESENTATIONS WORKFORCE IS AN ISSUE. I'M JUST WONDERING YOUR OPINION WHAT IS THE BIGGEST ISSUE AS IT PERTAINS TO ATTRACTING AND RETAINING -- HEALTH PROFESSIONALS AND WHAT CAN WE DO AS A LEGISLATURE. TO TO MAKE THAT BETTER AND ATTRACT MORE PEOPLE IN THAT PROFESSION. WELL IT'S REALLY THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE FOR OUR MEMBERS RIGHT NOW ATTRACTING AND RETAINING -- FOLKS IN THE AD IN THE PAPER HEALTH WORKFORCE I'M IN ONE ONE STRATEGY IS REALLY TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF LOANS TO INCREASE THE NUMBER I HAVE -- SCHOLARSHIPS -- AND STATEMENTS THAT ARE OFFERED -- IN A DISH TO BOLSTER OUR BEHAVIORAL WORK FIRST PIPELINE I'M STARTING IN HIGH SCHOOL REALLY EDUCATING FOLKS ABOUT WHAT DOES THIS MEAN AND ALSO -- ADDING TO THE PIPELINE BY ALLOWING PEERS AND OTHERS PROMONTORIES WERE MENTIONED EARLIER -- SO IT'S REALLY THAT PIPELINE APPROACH THAT YOU KNOW STRENGTHENS AND THEN -- PROVIDING THE INCENTIVES -- THAT WE ALL TEND TO FOCUS ON A LOT -- IN ADDITION WHEN WE THINK ABOUT -- ALLIED HEALTH CARE WORKERS WE NEED. TO PROVIDE RAINING FOR THEM AS WELL TO BE ABLE TO ASSIST US IT REALLY DOES HAVE TO BE A TEAM APPROACH AND WE TALK ABOUT INTEGRATED CARE A LOT -- BUT WE REALLY HAVE TO PUT OUR MONEY WHERE OUR MOUTH AS ALSO WHEN WE LOOK AT RESIDENCY SLOTS I KNOW THAT THOSE CAN BE LIMITED IN TRAINING SLOTS FOR ALL TYPES OF DIFFERENT PROFESSIONALS WE TEND TO JUST LOOK AT MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS PSYCHIATRIST CHILD PSYCHIATRISTS -- IN PARTICULAR AND NOT WITHSTANDING HAT A VERY IMPORTANT AREA TO FOCUS ON I THINK WHAT WAS MENTIONED EARLIER THOUGHT THERE ARE POLICIES ACROSS THE BOARD WITH IT -- BE HERE FOR HEALTH WORK FOR SO WE NEED TO LOOK AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES WE NEED TO LOOK AT THE UC AND CSU IS IN THE TRAINING PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE AND IF WE HAVE ENOUGH SLOTS FOR FOLKS. SO GET RELIEF FOR ME BOILS DOWN TO THAT PIPE -- ON THE OUTCOME [inaudible] THANK YOU. AND THAT THAT WORKFORCE COMMISSION ACTUALLY TALKED ABOUT A TEN YEAR PLAN ESSENTIALLY -- PRETTY. EXTENSIVE PLANTED TO BOLSTER WORKFORCE A LOT OF THIS BEHAVIOUR AS BASED ON BEHAVIORAL HEALTH NEEDS AND AND GRAB THE OBVIOUSLY REALLY CRITICAL -- LISTENING TO YOUR YEAR THERE'S COMMON THEME AMONG YOUR PRESENTATIONS HERO INEFFICIENCIES AND CHALLENGES WITH. OUR HAVING TO BUILD HEARD IN THE EARLIER SESSION TO THAT -- SO MUCH SO MUCH RESOURCES ARE TIED UP IN ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS THAT THERE I THINK THE FROM -- MISS LARSEN WE HEARD THAT -- COUNTIES TO AND MRS PROGRAMS PLUS ANOTHER 20% BASED ON ON ON SERVICES THAT ARE DENIED -- AND SO NOW YOU'RE ONLY HOW THESE KINDS OF THINGS ARE EXTREMELY EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING -- AND GIVE US YOU KNOW GIVE GIVE GIVE A LOT OF HEARTBURN FOR UP HERE PERSONALLY -- ONE OF THINGS THAT -- MISTER MAC AND AND ONE QUESTION I HAD FOR YOU BECAUSE I I WILL GET QUESTION YOU GUYS YOU TO ANSWER QUESTIONS I WAS LOOKING -- FOR AS FAR AS IN THINGS THAT ARE THAT ARE CRITICAL AND AND AND WHAT CAUGHT ME WILK WHAT I WONDERED AS WE START LOOKING SOMEWHERE BACKGROUND INFORMATION WITH MISTER MECCA WE TALKED UP PENETRATION ENGAGEMENT RATES ON THEIR THEIR LOW -- BUT THEIR DECLINING. SO WHY ARE THEY DECLINE THERE ARE THERE LOW IN THEIR DECLINING FURTHER WIRE THEY DECLINING -- I DON'T HAVE THE DEFINITIVE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION WE'VE HEARD THAT THAT TO SOME DEGREE -- CHILDREN ARE BEING SERVED -- BY PROP SIXTY THREE SO CONNIE'S COUNTIES ARE USING MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT MONEY -- AND NOT E. PST T. -- I DON'T KNOW HOW SORT OF WIDELY THAT IS THE CASE -- BUT IT'S IT'S DEFINITELY -- TROUBLING PHENOMENON. SO THE BEES SO YOU SO YOUR YOUR FEELINGS ARE BEING POTENTIALLY BEING SERVICE SOMEWHERE ELSE. THE INCIDENCES IT ISN'T GOING AWAY RIGHT AND I DO I DO THINK IT GETS TO TRYING TO FIND STRATEGIES. TO MAKE MORE. CONSISTENT ACROSS COUNTIES WHEN CAN USE THE PST IF YOU. IF YOU PRESENTED CHILD TO EXCELLENT COUNTY ADMINISTRATORS IN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH -- YOU MIGHT GET DIFFERENT MEDICAL NECESSITY FOR PARTICULARLY PST T. SERVICE -- AND IT'S IT'S NOT A SIMPLE THING AND I DON'T THINK THE GUIDANCE FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN PARTICULARLY CLEAR -- BUT THAT ENTITLEMENT IS EXTREMELY BROAD. AND I DO THINK WE HAVE A SICK WE HAVE A TERRIFIC OPPORTUNITY TO WORK TOGETHER TO SAY WHAT DO. WHAT DO WE IN CALIFORNIA BELIEVE HE PST T. REQUIRES AND IF WE DON'T SEE THIS SET OF SERVICES EVERYWHERE WE GO? AND IF A CHILD IN. TO HIM -- AND THEN A CHILD IN KERN WHO KIND OF PRESENT IN THE SAME WAY WE GET. YOU KNOW REASONABLY SORT OF CALM AND DIAGNOSIS IN THE DEFINITION OF MEDICAL NECESSITY IN WHAT WHAT SHOULD THEY GET THERE'S A LOT OF ROOM I THINK -- IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE COUNTIES IN THE STATE TO IMPROVE CONSISTENCY AND TO BROADEN -- ACCESS TO THE ENTITLEMENT AND TO THE EXTENT THAT THE FEAR FEDERAL AUDITS IS -- A CONCERN ABOUT YOU KNOW. WE WANT TO PUSH THE ENVELOPE BUT WHAT HAPPENS IF I HAVE TO SET ASIDE A MILLION DOLLARS IN MY BUDGET JUST BECAUSE I'M ASSUMING I'M GONNA GET AUDIT EXCEPTIONS -- WE DO HAVE TO WORK WITH OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS -- AND TO THE EXTENT THAT WE BELIEVE IN CALIFORNIA THAT CHILDREN SHOULD BE GETTING STUFF -- AND THAT THE PST T. ON THE CLAIM AT AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SAYS AFTER THE FACT SOMETIMES MANY YEARS AFTER THE FACT NO SORRY. YOU SHOULD HAVE CLAIM THAT -- THE STATE NEEDS TO SHARE RISK WITH US -- FOR DOING SO. JUST ONE THING I WOULD ADD TO WHAT FRANK SAID IS THAT YOU KNOW THERE'S VERY INCONSISTENT -- PRACTICES AMONG COUNTIES NUND THE INVESTMENT IN CHILDREN SERVICES FROM THE REALIGNMENT DOLLARS USE FOR CHILDREN AND FOR ADULTS SOME MORE PLACES MORE MONIES GOING TO ADULTS IF YOU LOOK AT THE AMOUNT SPENT PER CHILD IT'S VERY DIFFERENT IN DIFFERENT PLACES DIFFERENT COUNTY SO. I THINK THAT INVESTMENT IS AN ISSUE AND NEEDS TO BE LOOKED AT IT SHOULD BE. YOU KNOW BECAUSE A REALIGNMENT THERE'S A SENSE THAT THESE ARE THE COUNTY DOLLARS THAT THEY NEED TO PROTECTIONS FOR SO THAT THEY DON'T RUN OUT. AND THAT MEANS THAT THERE'S A BIT AT THERE'S TRIAGE BEING OF OF DELIVERY OF SERVICES INCLUDING TWO CHILDREN REGARDLESS THE ENTITLEMENT IN THE REGARDLESS THAT YOU COULD GET ADDITIONAL FUNDS. BEYOND THE CAPITATE YOU KNOW BEYOND WHAT'S PROVIDES A REALIGNMENT IF YOU NEEDED IT JUST THAT THERE'S A PROCESS TO DO THAT AND I THINK A LOT OF COUNTIES JUST. TO HOLD ON TO THAT AND BE CONSERVATIVE. EXCEPT AS THINGS THAT ARE REALLY BROADER ARE A POTENTIALLY OBVIOUSLY IT TO IT A DOUBLE EDGE SWORD AND AND THAT WELL I DON'T. WANT. TO BOX PEOPLE IN. BROAD DOES BROAD DEFINITIONS CREATE ARE OBVIOUSLY CREATED SOME MAJOR CHALLENGES FOR PEOPLE SO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME WITH THIS PROJECT ON WE HAVE OUR OUR THIRD PANEL WERE ACTUALLY BREAKING INTO AN ON SORRY NO NO THAT'S OKAY. I HAVE ONE MORE QUESTION AND THIS IS JUST BASED ON A PERSONAL EXPERIENCE AND I'M JUST CURIOUS TO SEE A FONG. IF YOU CAN ANSWER THIS QUESTION -- YOU KNOW I HEARD YOU SAY EARLIER THAT THERE IS A LACK OF SERVICES -- MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES UNDER THE AGE OF EIGHT SO I USED TO HAVE A STUDENT WHO YOU WHO WAS SCHIZOPHRENIC BASED ON WHAT EVERYONE WAS TELLING ME BUT SHE WAS CAUGHT IN THE MIDDLE WERE I WAS TOLD THAT SHE WAS TOO YOUNG TO BE DIAGNOSED AND AND QUALIFY FOR SERVICES -- CAN YOU TELL ME STILL AGE IS A OF THE REQUIREMENT FOR AGE IS STORED ISSUE AS IT PERTAINS TO DIAGNOSIS AND GETTING THOSE SERVICES. I MEAN I CAN TELL YOU FROM EXPERIENCE THAT I MEAN THERE ARE CLINICIANS IN THE AUDIENCE I'M SURE THEY CAN ANSWER THIS BUT I HAVE NOT SEEN A LIMITATION OF AGE BEING A BASIS FOR NOT GIVING IT DIAGNOSIS I'VE SEEN IT AT AGE THREE I'VE SEEN IT MANY AGES. SO I DON'T THINK THAT THAT ALONE IS A CRITERIA FOR NOT SERVING A CHILD NO MATTER WHAT THE AGE. HOWEVER I'M I'M SURE THAT THERE ARE CLINICAL FACTORS IN WHICH YOU DON'T WANT TO GIVE UNNECESSARILY OR INAPPROPRIATELY A DIAGNOSIS AT A EARLY AGE UNTIL YOU HAVE ENOUGH. EVIDENCE THAT THEY MEET THE DS I'M PREGNANT CRITERIA FOR THAT PARTICULAR DIAGNOSIS BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF DIAGNOSIS THAT ARE DELIVERED THAT ARE LIKE NOT OTHERWISE SPECIFIED OR NOT. REALLY SURE WHAT'S GOING ON KIND OF THING. WHICH IS BASED ON THE INFORMATION YOU SEE THAT THE TIME THEY SAID SHE WAS TOO YOUNG TO BE DIAGNOSED THAT SOMETIMES THEY BELIEVE IT'S BEHAVIORS THAT KIDS GROW OUT OF FUND WE WERE CERTAIN WHAT SHE HAD IT WAS VERY CLEAR. BUT SHE COULDN'T GET SERVICES AND MOM WAS STUCK IN THE MIDDLE AS HE SAID JUST BEING PUSHED AROUND FROM -- CLINIC TO CLINIC AND KNOW WHAT NOBODY WOULD HELP OR SO I WAS JUST WONDERING. IF IF YOU KNOW BUT THANK YOU A. S. YOU ANSWER MY QUESTION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SO WE'RE BREAKING OUR NEXT PANEL INTO IN A IN A BE -- THERE'S A PART IT'S A VERY PRETTY LARGE PANEL SO WE HAVE -- SEVEN SEVEN SPEAKERS ALL TOGETHER -- OUR FIRST FOUR SPEAKERS -- SERRA AND THIS IS ON MENTAL HEALTH COVERAGE MEDI CAL MEDICAL MET MENTAL HEALTH COVERAGE FOR ADULTS OUR FIRST -- PANELS WILL BE SIERRA GAVIN THE CHEAP BEHAVIOR OFFICER OF COMMUNICATOR HEALTH CENTERS IN AN FQHC IN YOLO COUNTY. MY OLD MAN WHO WAS THE CEO OF HEALTH PLAN OF SAN MATTEO. SIR OUR QUIZ TO HIS FIGHT -- VP OF ACCOUNT PARTNERSHIPS WOULD BE CAN HELP OPTIONS OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PLAN. AND DOCTOR KEY ANDREA A BUNCH WHO IS A PSYCHOLOGIST WITH THE AND ALASKAN SHOULD TRY TO KEEP YOUR COMMENTS TO FIVE MINUTES IF POSSIBLE PLEASE SO THEY HAVE A WE STILL HAVE. FIVE MORE SPEAKERS AND PUBLIC COMMENTS SO I APPRECIATE THAT THE DISCUSSIONS HAVE BEEN GREAT AND AND THE REALLY VALUABLE AND I THINK IT ILLUSTRATES THE THE CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE AND AND AND CERTAINLY SET THE STAGE FOR FUTURE HEARINGS ON THIS ISSUE SO -- SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND SO ON SERRA GAVIN FIRST PLEASE. THANK YOU. SOME MEMBERS MY NAME IS SARAH GAVIN I AM THE CHIEF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH OFFICER AT COMMUNICATOR HEALTH CENTERS. COMMUNICATOR IS THE LARGEST FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTER IN YOLO COUNTY RIGHT NEXT DOOR AND I AM ALSO A LICENSED MARRIAGE AND FAMILY THERAPIST AND A LICENSED PROFESSIONAL CLINICAL COUNSELOR. AND IT PROVIDED DIRECT SERVICE AND THE PROVISION OF SERVICES AND ADDICTION TREATMENT AND MENTAL HEALTH FOR FOURTEEN YEARS. ELEVEN OF WHICH HAVE BEEN IN AN FQHC SETTING SO MANY OF THE COMPLICATED SYSTEM SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY I PROVIDED DIRECT SERVICE IN THOSE COMPLICATED SYSTEMS. COMMUNICATOR IS A VERY UNIQUE FQHC MOST FQHCS ARE PROVIDING -- THE PROVISION OF MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IN THE MILD TO MODERATE CONTINUUM AND COMMUNICATOR AS CONTRACTED WITH A YOLO COUNTY TO PROVIDE THE FULL CONTINUUM OF CARE FOR SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH. AND DRUG MEDICAL SERVICES AND WE ARE THE LARGEST DRUG MEDI CAL PROVIDER IN YOLO COUNTY CURRENTLY. A CALIFORNIA'S AND MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE SYSTEM IS VERY COMPLICATED AND WE HAVE PAIRED ONE OF THE MOST COMPLICATED SYSTEMS TO NAVIGATE WITH PATIENTS LEAST LIKELY AND ABLE TO NAVIGATE THEM. PATIENTS THAT ARE SUFFERING OF COURSE FROM ADDICTION -- ACTED IN A HOUSE OF SYMPTOMS TRAGEDY AND AND TRAUMA AND ISSUES RELATED TO POVERTY AND STRESSORS AND TRANSPORTATION ISSUES AND LANGUAGE BARRIERS AND WE INVITE THEM INTO A SYSTEM OF CARE. AND WE MAKE IT VERY NUANCED AND COMPLICATED FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO MANAGE IT AND I FEEL PRIVILEGED TO BE ABLE TO WORK IN AN FQHC SETTING FOR FQHCS CAN SIMPLIFY THE PROCESS FOR CLIENTS NAVIGATE CARE WE CAN. OFFER SERVICES IN A D. SIGMA TIES SETTING IN A WAY IN A VENUE THAT CAN OFFER MOST THE SERVICES UNDER ONE ROOF SO WE'RE ABLE TO PROVIDE WARM HAND OFF AND LINK PEOPLE DIRECTLY TO CARE. SO WE DON'T HAVE TO REFER OUT IN MOST CASES -- AND HELP THEM FIGURE OUT ANOTHER CLUNKY SYSTEM. AND SO IF OF TO WHICH THESE ARE ONE OF THE I THINK MY MOST PERFECT VENUES PROVIDING A FULL CONTINUUM MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE SERVICES -- WHY AREN'T MORE FQHCS PROVIDING CARE IN THE SYSTEM SO I'D LIKE TO SHARE THAT THERE'S NOT MANY FQHCS THAT ARE PROVIDING THIS LEVEL OF CARE IN THE COMMUNITY? AND I'D LIKE TO SHARE OF THREE TOP REASONS WHY -- FIRST AS I MENTIONED AND IF YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH FQHCS WE HAVE AN INTEGRATED SYSTEM IN PRIMARY CARE AND DENTAL AND COMPREHENSIVE PERINATAL SERVICES. AND IT'S A HUGE BENEFIT FOR OUR COMMUNITY AND OUR CLIENTS. UNFORTUNATELY -- AND THERE'S BEEN ALSO LOTS OF CONVERSATION TODAY ABOUT THE BENEFITS OF INNER -- WOVEN OF PRIMARY CARE WITH SUBSTANCE USE AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND WHAT HAVE BENEFITTED IS THE PATIENTS ARE ACCESSING CARE. UNFORTUNATELY FOR OF TO WHICH YOU TO PARTICIPATE IN AS MODELS TO CARE THE STATE HAS ACTUALLY TAKEN THE POSITION THAT IN ORDER FOR FQHCS TO PROVIDE THIS CARE WE HAVE TO COMPLETELY. SILO THE FQHC SIDE AND THE SUBSTANCE USE AND SPECIAL TO MENTAL HEALTH SIDE -- WHICH REALLY IS IN DIRECT CONTRAST WITH SOME OF THE WORK THAT WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO ACHIEVE AND THE AND THE MOVE THAT WE'RE TRYING. TO MOVE FORWARD AND THE SECOND PIECE AND I THINK THIS IS I'M JUST ECHOING WHAT'S ALREADY BEEN SAID IS THE ADMINISTRATIVE AND DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS FOR SPECIAL TO MENTAL HEALTH AND DRUG MEDI CAL OR PRETTY ONEROUS. BURDEN SOME HAVING BILL THEM MYSELF -- IT AT OUR HEALTH CENTER IN SPECIAL TO MENTAL HEALTH ON AVERAGE CLINICIANS SPEND 40% OF THEIR TIME CLINICIANS BEHAVIORAL HEALTH QUESTIONS -- SPENT 40% OF THEIR TIME MANAGING THE ADMINISTRATIVE AND DOCUMENTATION STANDARDS OF CARE AND THAT'S NOT INCLUDING THE ADMINISTRATIVE STAFF MANAGED JUST ALLOWANCES AND AND THE DOCUMENTATION ITSELF SO. WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IN CALIFORNIA THAT WE HAVEN'T ACCESS TO CARE ISSUE FOR MENTAL HEALTH AND THEN WE'RE TAKING QUALIFIED HEALTH PROFESSIONALS WHO ARE SEEING ARE ARGUABLY MOST VULNERABLE PATIENTS OUR COMMUNITY? CHILDREN WITH -- SPECIALLY MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS AND SUBSTANCE USE NEEDS AND WE ARE CARVING OUT 40% OF THEIR TIME IN ORDER TO PROVIDE CARE. WE ALSO HAVE A HUGE WORKFORCE CHALLENGE IN FIELD OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND THE NUMBER ONE REASON I HEAR A CLINICIAN THAT WANTS TO BE TRANSFERRED TO A DIFFERENT DEPARTMENT. OR TO LEAVE A NONPROFIT WORKING TIME STAND MORE QUALIFIED MENTAL HEALTH CLINICIANS AND IT'S ESPECIALLY TRAGIC TO LOSE AND THE PAPERWORK. AND LASTLY ONE OF THE ON GOING CHALLENGES WE HAVE IS IN ORDER FOR US TO PARTICIPATE IN THESE COUNTY -- FUNDED A CARVE OUT PROGRAMS IS WE HAVE TO HAVE A CONTRACT WITH THE COUNTY AND WE'RE LUCKY TO HAVE ONE AND WE HAVE TO THEN RE APPLY THROUGH A COMPETITIVE BRED PROCESS EVERY THREE YEARS. IN ORDER TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE DRUG MEDI CAL AND SPECIAL TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES SO YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT MAKES IT EXTREMELY CHALLENGING TO BUILD AND INVEST IN A STABLE PROGRAM ONE EVERY THREE YEARS YEARS IT COULD ESSENTIALLY RESET. SO FOR THOSE REASONS -- MANY OF COMMITTEES ARE NOT PARTICIPATING IN THE SERVICES ON THAT WOULD BE A HUGE BENEFIT FOR OUR COMMUNITY AND ACCURATE SHE'S ARE REALLY EXPERTS IN PROVIDING INTEGRATIVE CARE. ON HAND AND HAVE EXPERTISE IN PROVIDING CARE THE MOST DISENFRANCHISED COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND OUR COMMUNITY FEELS VERY SAFE COMING INTO AN FQHC SETTING TO TO RECEIVE CARE. A FEW RECOMMENDATIONS WE HAVE IN RESPONSE TO THAT IS -- ONE IS -- TO LOOK CAN THIS IS NOT NEW BUT LOOK AT THE BIFURCATED SYSTEM AND A SIMPLIFIED TO ONE SOURCE OF PAYMENT FOR ALL ACUITY LEVELS TO HELP CLIENTS BE ABLE TO NAVIGATE AND HELP OUR PROVIDERS BE ABLE TO NAVIGATE IT. AND SECOND TO LOOK AT MORE INNOVATIVE PAYMENT METHODOLOGIES THAT WOULD ACTUALLY INCENTIVIZE INTEGRATION WITH PRIMARY CARE AN FQHC SETTING SO THAT WOULD BE. VALUE BASED PAYMENTS OR PAPER PERFORMANCE ARE AS OPPOSED TO A VERY SPECIFIC -- WAY OF BILLING I I MANAGE OVER TWENTY FIVE DIFFERENT FUNDING STREAMS WITHIN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND ALL HAVE A VERY SPECIFIC AND NUANCED ADMINISTRATIVE AND CLINICAL AND DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS -- AND LAST IS TO REDUCE THE DOCUMENTATION STANDARD FOR SPECIAL TO MENTAL HEALTH WE JUST. DO NOT HAVE THE ACCESS THAT WE NEED TO PROVIDE THE NONPROFIT SETTING. AND I FEEL EXTREMELY PRIVILEGED TO BE ABLE TO BE WORKING A COMMUNICATOR AND SEEING THE WORK THAT WE'RE DOING FOR THE COMMUNITY AND WE ARE REALLY THE CONTINUAL DOUBT PATIENT CONTINUUM OF CARE FOR YOLO COUNTY -- AND I HOPE THE CHANGES CAN BE MADE THAT WOULD SUPPORT THE GOOD WORK WE'RE DOING AND TO INCENTIVIZE MORE FQHCS TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS CARE SO. I THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. I AM ALSO SENDING A WRITTEN TESTIMONY THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU [inaudible] PLEASE. MY NAME IS MY OFTEN ON THE CO THE HEALTH PLAN IS OF SAN MATTEO -- OUR PLAN IS ALSO A MEMBER OF THE LOCAL HEALTH PLANS OF CALIFORNIA. ON AND ALSO SPEAKING BEHALF ON BEHALF OF THAT ORGANIZATION -- HEALTH PLAN IS A MATTEO IS A COUNTY ORGANIZED HEALTH SYSTEM. WE'VE HAD SENIORS AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES ENROLLED WITH US SINCE THE BEGINNING NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN AS WELL AS PEOPLE WHO ARE DUALLY ELIGIBLE FOR BOTH MEDICAID AND MEDICARE. A LOT OF THOSE PEOPLE THAT ARE DULY ELIGIBLE ARE -- COMPLEX -- MENTALLY ILL CLIENTS THAT ARE ALL CLIENTS OF THE COUNTY PAPER HEALTH SYSTEM. SO I WANT TO FOCUS ON OUR LOCAL SAID THE THINGS WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO DO I THINK IT MIGHT BE OF INTEREST TO YOU -- I THINK WE UNIQUE MAYBE THERE'S ANOTHER PLAN BUT I HAVEN'T HEARD ABOUT IT YET THAT -- WE CONTRACT WITH THE COUNTY BEHAVIOR HEALTH AND RECOVERY SERVICES -- FOR ALL OF OUR PLAN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE RESPONSIBILITIES. ARE WE DO NOT CONTRACT WITH A THIRD ENTITY -- A BEHAVIORAL HEALTH COMPANY WITH ONE EXCEPTION WHICH ALL EXPLAINED -- WE'VE HOW SO HOW WE GROWN OUR COLLABORATION ARE CONTRACTING ARRANGEMENT. ONE TWO THOUSAND SIX WE STARTED A PROGRAM IT'S CALLED A DUAL ELIGIBLE SPECIAL NEEDS PLAN. WHICH IS A PROGRAM ALL FEDERAL PROGRAM FOR PEOPLE ELIGIBLE FOR BOTH MEDICAID AND MEDICARE -- ODD COVERS THEIR MEDICARE BENEFITS -- YOU KNOW MY INSTINCT I WAS NEW TO HELP PLAN AND MY MY INSTINCT WAS IMMEDIATELY TO CONTRACT WITH THE COUNTY. BECAUSE THE WHOLE POINT OF THE DUAL ELIGIBLE SPECIAL NEEDS PLAN PROGRAM IS TO COORDINATE MEDICARE AND MEDICAID BENEFITS CALIFORNIA HAS A RICH MEDICAID BENEFIT FOR MENTALLY ILL PEOPLE SO IT JUST MADE SENSE TO KEEP THOSE -- MEDICARE AND AND MEDICAID BENEFITS TOGETHER. IN TWENTY FOURTEEN THE PLANS THE MEDICAID MANAGED CARE PLANS WERE GIVEN RESPONSIBILITY FOR MILD TO MODERATE AND ON ALL SERVICES AND ALSO SERVICES OFFER CHILDREN ON THE AUTISM SPECTRUM. AGAIN WE CONTRACTED WITH THE COUNTY WE DID DOG CHANGE OUR MINDS A COUPLE YEARS LATER MUTUAL AGREEMENT ABOUT AUTISM IT WAS NOT WORKING OUT AS WE WOULD LIKE IT'S NOT AN AREA OF EXPERTISE FOR OUR BEHAVIOR HEALTH DEPARTMENTS WE CONTRACTED WITH MAGELLAN. SO THAT'S THE ONE EXCEPTION. IN -- TWENTY FOURTEEN WE ALSO STARTED THE IN CALIFORNIA THE COUNT MANY CONNECTS YOU SEE I THE TOOLS DEMO. AGAIN WE CONTRACT WE CONTINUE CONTRACTING WITH THE COUNTY FOR BEHAVIOR HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE BENEFITS -- FOR THOSE MEDICARE FUNDED BENEFITS. SO WHAT'S WORKED WELL WITH THIS ARRANGEMENT -- FIRST OF ALL DARK COUNTY BEHAVIORAL DEPARTMENT PROVIDES EXCELLENT CLIENT SERVICES THAT'S REALLY WHAT THEY EXCEL AT THEY DO A LOT OF INTEGRATION OF PRIMARY CARE AND BEAVER HAULS APPLES MENTAL HEALTH CLINIC SITES IN PRIMARY CARE SITES -- THERE'S BEEN GREAT PROGRESS MADE ON WHOLE PERSON CARE. I THINK THE KIND OF ISSUES THAT CAME LUIS WAS DESCRIBING WE GET ON THE PHONE AND WE WORK OUT ISSUES WE FIGURE OUT THE PAYMENT LATER BUT AT CLIENT IS IN OUR A MEMBER IS NEVER FAR FROM ANY SERVICE ON BECAUSE IT'S IT MIGHT BE YOU KNOW. IT'S UNCLEAR WHAT SYSTEM THAT SERVICE THOSE -- IS UNDER ONE AND HE IS ALL IS REALLY HELPFUL SO PHARMACY PART D. FOR EXAMPLE IS -- UNDER OUR RESPONSIBILITY HEALTH PLANS RESPONSIBILITY. I'LL JUST GIVING EXAMPLES SEVERAL YEARS AGO -- WE HAD A MEMBER WHO UNFORTUNATELY LOST ON ENROLLMENT WITH US BECAUSE I HE HAD LOST HIS -- MEDICAID ELIGIBILITY FOR A SHORT TIME HE WAS RE ENROLLED IN ANOTHER PART DEEP PLAN HE HAD TROUBLE GETTING HIS MEDICATIONS. WHY HE ENDED UP -- HAVING UP UP UP PSYCHOTIC BREAK AND HE WAS SHOT DEAD BY THE POLICE IN FRONT OF THIS -- ON FRONT OF HIS HOME BECAUSE YOU SPREADING FAMILY MEMBERS OF POLICE WITH THAT WITH A KNIFE. SO I MEAN IT'S THE MEDICATION PIECES SO IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE MENTALLY ILL -- WERE ALSO THE FOR STRUGGLE REASONS WITH THE ONLY PLAN THAT HAS MEDICAID MENTAL HEALTH DRUGS CARVE DâN ON TO OUR PLAN AND THAT IS WORK JUST EXTREMELY WELL ON AT A LOCAL LEVEL. ANOTHER EXAMPLE THAT SCHOOL WHAT'S WORKED WELL WITH THE DOLE'S DEMO IS THAT THERE ARE SHARED OUTCOME GOALS AND SHARED SAVINGS AVAILABLE IN THAT PROGRAM IN A SMALL WAY. SO -- WE HAVE WORKED TOGETHER WITH BEHAVIOR HEALTH AND WE SUCCEED THE CALL CALL YOU WITHHOLD MEASURES PAID BACK AND WE'VE SHARED THE US SAVINGS WITH -- OUR BEHAVIOR HEALTH DEPARTMENT AND I CAN. I INTEREST OF TIME I CAN ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT LATER IF YOU'RE INTERESTED -- WE'VE DONE -- A LOT OF INFORMATION SHARING WE SHARE CARE PLANS AND I THINK WE DO A GOOD JOB YOU CAN ALWAYS BE IMPROVED AROUND JOINT CARE COORDINATION OF OUR OUR FOR A JOINT MEMBERS. SO WHAT NEEDS IMPROVEMENT. WELL FRANKLY IN THIS IS FOLLOWING UP AND DIRECTOR CANS COMMENTS ARE COUNTY AND I DON'T THINK IT'S UNUSUAL IS NOT GOOD AT PLAN -- ADMINISTRATIVE BUSINESS FUNCTIONS SO COMPLIANCE NETWORK MANAGING IN CONTRACTING. UTILIZATION MANAGEMENT ALSO NEED SOME WORK CLAIMS PAYMENT A CALL CENTER GRIEVANCE AN APPEALS REPORTING TO THE STATE AND AND FEDERAL REGULATORS ON QUALITY REPORTING. I THINK THE PLANS ON GENERALLY I MEAN -- IT'S SO MUCH OF WHAT WE DO THAT WERE BETTER AT THAT. WE WE'D DELEGATED A LOT OF THOSE FUNCTIONS TO OUR COUNTY PARTNER WHEN WE DELEGATED SOME OF THESE PROGRAMS. AND NOW WE'RE WE THINKING THAT -- IS SO DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO DO ADMINISTRATIVE -- TIME SUCK AND SO -- AND IT'S SIX INCREASINGLY CHALLENGING AS DIRECTOR KANSEN WITH THE NEW FEDERAL ON MEDIC MEDICAID MANAGED CARE RULE. SO OUR GOAL IS TO BOMB ACOSTA JOINT CALL WITH THE COUNTY HEALTH LEADERSHIP IS TO DEVELOP A STRUCTURE WHERE THE HEALTH PLAN REALLY CANDLES MOST THE PLAN FUNCTIONS ACROSS ALL PROGRAM SO IT'S NOT JUST. THE PROGRAMS ARE RESPONSIBLE ONE WOULD ALSO SERIOUSLY AT THE CARVE OUT PROGRAM TO TO THE EXTENT WE CAN UNDER THE CURRENT ARRANGEMENT -- AND THAT THE THE COUNTY BEAVER HEALTH DEPARTMENT REALLY FOCUS ON PROVIDING SERVICE SERVICES AND WHAT THEY DO BEST SO FOR EXAMPLE. WE WOULD RUN A CALL CENTER WE WOULD COLLATE COLOCATED APRIL STAFF AT THE CALL CENTER. AND AND DIAL IT DOWN IN WE WE HAD WAS TO HAVE A MUCH MORE SOPHISTICATED CALL CENTER THAN ANYTHING IF THEY CAN DO. SO THAT'S JUST ONE EXAMPLE WHAT WE MIGHT DO -- AND OUR GOAL IS THEN TO INTEGRATE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE UNDER THE CURRENT FRAMEWORK. SO MY ADVICE FOR THE STATE -- BASED ON OUR LOCAL EXPERIENCES FIRST OF ALL -- WE WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE RECENT REFERENCE IT'S CALLED A BLUEPRINT. ON WHICH CALLS FOR INTEGRATION OF OF PHYSICAL BEHAVIOR HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE SERVICES UNDER ONE ENTITY. BUT WE HAVE TO BE DONE REALLY SLOWLY IT HAS TO BE DONE -- THROUGH A PHASE AND PROCESS SOME COUNTIES ARE MORE READY TO DO JACK ANOTHER'S COUNTIES AND SOME PLANS I'M ALREADY DO THAT AND OTHER PLANTS. I THINK WE REALLY NEED TO EXPAND MAINTAIN AND EXPAND THE DOLES DEMONSTRATION BECAUSE AGAIN THE MOST COMPLEX BEHAVIOR ALL CLIENTS ARE DOUBLES AND SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE COVERING THEM AS WELL AND THAT WORK. WE WE HAVE SOME LOCAL CONTROL OVER THE PHARMACY PARTY BENEFITS. AND THEN -- I THINK IT'S YOU KNOW I KNOW THAT MOST OF MENTAL HEALTH PHARMACY -- IS CARVED OUT NOW THE MOST NEARLY ALL THE PLANTS BUT I NEED TO I THINK UP I THINK IT SHOULD BE WHICH IS SORT OF THE BECAUSE AGAIN MEDICATIONS ARTS SO KEYED TO THE CARE. OF MENTALLY ILL AND NOT SUBSTANCE AND CLIENTS WITH SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MISTER CHRIS. WHAT A DIRT ROAD AT THE THINGS WERE OUT OF ORDER BUT? SO GOOD AFTERNOON THANKS FOR HAVING ME MY AND THINGS THAT HAVE TO DO TO TESTIFY MY NAME IS THERE AREN'T QUEST. I'M A VICE PRESIDENT WITH BEACON HEALTH OPTIONS. BEGIN AS THE LARGEST INDEPENDENTLY OWNED SPECIALTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ORGANIZATION IN AMERICA WE SERVE -- WE WORK IN ALL FIFTY STATES INCLUDING MANAGING MEDICAID FOR THIRTEEN MILLION PUBLIC PROGRAM BENEFICIARIES AND ABOUT TWENTY STATES. OUR MISSION DRIVEN ORGANIZATION AND HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE WORK WITH EIGHT MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE PLANS. TO MANAGE THE SPECIAL THE MILD TO MODERATE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR NEARLY ONE IN THREE MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES -- WE HAVE A NETWORK OF FOUR THOUSAND INDEPENDENT PROVIDERS AND TWENTY FIVE COUNTIES FROM SAN DIEGO TO HUMBLE. WITH REGARDS TO WHAT'S WORKING WELL IN THE SYSTEM TODAY. AND I THINK UNDOUBTEDLY MORE MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES HAVE ACCESS TO SERVICES TODAY THAN THEY DID FIVE YEARS AGO BEFORE THE ADDITION. OF THE MILD TO MODERATE BENEFIT I'M SO LAST YEAR WE PAID FOR SERVICES FOR THREE HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND UNIQUE BENEFICIARIES. AND WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO DO WORK TO EXPAND ACCESS. PARTICULAR IN CERTAIN DIFFICULT GEOGRAPHIES AND FOR CERTAIN SPECIALTIES -- INTEL HEALTH IS A REALLY IMPORTANT KEY -- TO HERE. ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND UNIQUE BENEFICIARIES USE TELEHEALTH SERVICES LAST YEAR WHICH WAS FOUR TIMES THE AMOUNT IN. TWENTY SIXTEEN AND WE EXPECT THAT TRADUCTOR YOU OF INCREASING CONTINUE. SO WE'VE EXPERIENCED STRONG COLLABORATION WITH REPRESENTATIVES FROM COUNTING -- COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENTS INDIVIDUAL WILLINGNESS TO COLLABORATE AND DO WHAT'S RIGHT FOR BENEFICIARIES A STEADFAST. BUT THE STRUCTURAL BARRIERS OF LIP SPLITTING THE SYSTEM BASED ON IMPAIRMENT LEVEL CHALLENGE EVEN THE BEST OF INTENTIONS. SAID INCREASES IN MINNESOTA BURDENS LIMITS CONTINUITY OF CARE AND IS FRAUGHT WITH OPPORTUNITIES AND FROM THIS HAVE TO DO A LACK OF INFORMATION SHARING. AND LIKE EVERYONE ELSE IS ALREADY SAID TODAY IT HAMPERS PERSON CENTERED CARE BECAUSE THE FINANCING OFTEN DELIVERS THE PROVIDER IN CARE SETTING. AND NOT AN INDIVIDUALS NEEDS. SOMEBODY IS A SORT OF MODIFIED CASE STUDY JUST TO TRY TO HIGHLIGHT THIS FOR YOU AND LET'S USE THE EXAMPLE OF A MIDDLE AGED WOMAN EXPERIENCING DEPRESSION OR ANXIETY. THE PAPER SCRIBE AN ANTIDEPRESSANT AND ENCOURAGE YOU TO CALL BEACON FOR THERAPY REFERRAL. WHEN SHE CALLS FOR STATE REQUIREMENTS SHE UNDERGOES A BRIEF SCREENING SCREENING TO DETERMINE IF SHE FILES INTO MY INTO MILD TO MODERATE BUCKET? ORANGE THE MODERATE TO SEVERE BUCKET. WE WORK IN TWENTY FIVE COUNTIES THAT MEANS EACH COUNTY HAS A DIFFERENT PROCESS FOR COORDINATING THOSE REFERRALS AND A DIFFERENT CRITERIA. ARE DIFFERENT STANDARDS FOR H. SHE WILL GET SERVICE AS SO LITERALLY THE SAME PERSON AND ONE COUNTY MAY BE ACCEPTED INTO SERVICES I WON'T BE IN ANOTHER WE DO TRACK ALL OF THOSE REFERRALS AS KIM SAID. AND WE SCREEN ABOUT FORTY THOUSAND PEOPLE LAST YEAR IN ABOUT 96% STATE AT OUR LEVEL OF CARE. BUT ALL THAT TRACKING IS ADMINISTRATIVELY. BURDENSOME WHEN IT COULD OTHERWISE BE SPENT ON MAKING PEOPLE SO IN THIS CASE OF THE WOMAN IS REFERRED TO A BEACON THERAPIST -- BUT AFTER A FEW MONTHS LET'S SAY HER DEPRESSION WORSENS AND SHE SHE BECOME SUICIDAL SO SHE'S ADMITTED TO A PSYCHIATRIC FACILITY. AT THIS POINT BEACON HER THERAPIST HER HEALTH PLAN FOR PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER NOBODY KNOWS SHE'S BEEN ADMITTED TO THE HOSPITAL BECAUSE THAT SERVICE IS NOW PAID FOR MANAGED BY THE COUNTY. EACH COUNTY HAS A DIFFERENT PROCESS FOR THE DISCHARGE PLANNING. BUT MORE THAN LIKELY SHE WON'T BE RECONNECTED WITH HER BEACON THERAPIST BECAUSE THAT THERAPIST IS NOT PART OF THE COUNTIES NETWORK. NOT MEAN SHE HAS TO START OVER ON HER TREATMENT JOURNEY. THERE ARE INSTANCES WHEN SOMEBODY WILL BE DISCHARGED DIRECTLY FROM INPATIENT TO A MILD TO MODERATE PROVIDER. BUT IN THIS INSTANCE WE ARE UNABLE TO PAY FOR CASE MANAGEMENT COLLATERAL AND THE OTHER REHABILITATION OPTION SERVICES THAT CAN HELP ADDRESS PSYCHO SOCIAL STRESSORS IN HER LIFE. THAT ARE REALLY IMPORTANT TO HELP MAINTAIN SOMEBODY AT THE MODERATE LEVEL. SO WE BELIEVE THAT A BENEFICIARY SHOULD BE ABLE TO ACCESS ALL ALLOW WILL BENEFITS AND SERVICES ACROSS THE FULL CONTINUUM FROM A SINGLE COHESIVE PROVIDER NETWORK. THERE ARE MANY WAYS TO ORGANIZE A SYSTEM OF CARE TO ACHIEVE THAT GOAL. YOU CAN WORKS WITH MEDICAID IN TWENTY STATES -- THEN WE SEE DIFFERENT VARIATIONS OF ACHIEVING THAT GOAL. BUT WE WOULD ENCOURAGE A SYSTEM THAT REDUCES COMPLEXITY EMPHASIZES PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION. ENSURES CONTINUITY OF CARE AND PROMOTES TRANSPARENCY AND QUALITY AN OUTCOME IMPROVEMENTS. I MAY USE MY LAST MINUTE TO FOCUS ON THE SYSTEM FOR EVENTS THAT ARE FEASIBLE WITHIN THE EXISTING REGULATORY FRAMEWORK FOR CALIFORNIA. AND THE FIRST THE STATE SHOULD CONSIDER SOME BASELINE CREATING SOME BASELINE EXPECTATIONS FOR CRISIS SYSTEM DESIGN. AND INFRASTRUCTURE AND PROVIDE DIRECTIVES GUIDANCE TO COUNTIES AND DATA SHARING FOR BETTER COORDINATION PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION. SECOND CALIFORNIA SHOULD INVEST IN A LARGE SCALE IN LARGE SCALE REGIONAL PSYCHIATRIC CONSULTATION PROGRAMS THAT IMPROVE ACCESS AND QUALITY FOR BY PROVIDING REAL TIME SUPPORT TO PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS. THIS PROGRAM SHOULD BE PAYER AGNOSTIC. POTENTIAL FUNDING SOURCES COULD BE PROP FIFTY SIX OR THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT. AND LASTLY EXPAND THE ARRAY OF SERVICES THAT MEDI CAL MANAGE PLANT MANAGED CARE PLANS CAN PAY. FOR THAT'S IMPROVING OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN INDIVIDUALS AT THE MODERATE LEVEL SO THEY DON'T NEED SPECIAL TEAM AT THE HOUSE SERVICES TO THE COUNTY. THIS COULD INCLUDE PAYING FOR FAMILY THERAPY COLLATERAL CARE COORDINATION AND ALLOWING FOR SERVICES RENDERED BY PEERS AND INDIVIDUALS WITH EXPERIENCE. I'VE SUBMIT AND I'VE SUBMITTED MUCH MORE DETAILED WRITTEN TESTIMONY -- BUT I APPRECIATE THE TIME TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- DOCTOR MUCH. HI MINIS. MY NAME'S COUNTERPUNCH I'M A LICENSED PSYCHOLOGIST FOR THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES. AND I'M HERE TODAY AND IN MY CAPACITY AS A MEMBER OF ESSAY YOU. SEVEN TWENTY ONE YOU CAN HAVE A BETTER YOU MEMBERS. THROUGHOUT THE STATE WHO WORK FOR COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. I HAVE DEDICATED MY CAREER. TO PROVIDING SERVICES THAT FOR AT RISK AND UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES I'VE WORKED WITH. CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS HEARING CRISIS WHICH CHILDREN AND FAMILIES HERE PART AT THE DCFS SYSTEM I WORK WITH JUVENILE JUSTICE. AND PRIVATELY I WORKED WITH DEFENDANTS WHO ARE FACING ISSUES OF COMPETENCY AND VETERANS. IN MY CURRENT. A. O. T. IS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE AGGRESSIVE OUTREACH TO PEOPLE WHO ARE HISTORICALLY RESISTANT TO TREATMENT. BY AGGRESSIVE I MEAN. WE GO OUT WE OFFER SERVICES AND EVEN IF THEY SAY NO WE KEEP COMING BACK THE GOAL OF DOT IT'S TO GET INDIVIDUALS. TO VOLUNTARILY AGREED TO SERVICES. BUT IF THEY CONTINUE TO REFUSE WE HAVE THE OPTION OF MANDATING THEM THROUGH COURT. COUNTY SPECIALLY MENTAL HEALTH. COLLABORATE ACROSS SYSTEMS. WHEN THEY ARE FOR WE AUTOMATICALLY AND IMMEDIATELY COLLABORATE WITH THEM TO TRY TO ENGAGE THE CLIENTS AND SERVICES? THAT MEANS GOING AND MEETING LAW ENFORCEMENT AND DRIVING AROUND THEM FOR AN HOUR AND LOOKING FOR CLIENTS GET ROW. IT MEANS GOING TO A HOSPITAL AS SOON AS THE HOSPITAL BECAUSE AND HAD AND HAVING THEM INTRODUCED US TO A CLIENT TO IMMEDIATELY AND ENGAGE IN OUTREACH AND TRACK AB T.. ONE OF THE STRENGTH OF OUR PROGRAM IS THE OUT REACHING GAUGE MATT THESE ARE CLIENTS WHO. DON'T WANT TO GO TO A CLINIC THEY HAVE MANY HAVE DIAGNOSIS OF SCHIZOPHRENIA AND A LOT OF PARANOIA AROUND SYSTEMS. SO OUT REACH LOOKS LIKE GOING AND FINDING THEM ONCE A WEEK OR TWICE A WEEK ON SKID ROW AND BRING THEM. BRINGING THEM LUNCH BRING THEM BREAKFAST IT MEANS GOING OUT AND TAKING A MAP AND TAKING THEM TO SOCIAL SECURITY OFFICE AND DRIVING AROUND FOR THE AFTERNOON. WHILE PROVIDING MOTIVE MOTIVATIONAL INTERVIEWING IN THE CAR TO TRY TO ENGAGE THEM AROUND TREATMENT WORK IS FUNDED WITH MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT FUNDING AND OVER HALF OF OUR CLIENTS. ARE EITHER LINK WITH MEDI CAL OR MEDI CAL ELIGIBLE. BECAUSE THE COUNTIES FOCUS IS ON SERIOUSLY MENTALLY ILL. WE'RE ABLE TO USE THIS WHATEVER IT TAKES MENTALITY. TO REACH SOMEWHERE THERE WHERE THEY ARE AS I SAID TWO WEEKS AGO I WAS AT THE CLIENT AND WE WERE. PICKING HER UP AND GETTING GROCERIES. SO WE'RE DOING WHATEVER IT WHATEVER WE CAN WEAR FOR IT THEY ARE TO TRY TO ENGAGE THEM AND SHE MET. OUR COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH TEAMS. CONSIST OF A RANGE OF LIFE AND AN UNLICENSED INDIVIDUALS. KINI MENTAL HEALTH WORKERS PSYCHOLOGIST PSYCHIATRISTS SOCIAL WORKERS ON A TEASE. AND WE TRAINING GET EXPERIENCE IN DIFFERENT. COUNTY PROGRAMS BUILDING OUR EXPERTISE ACROSS A RANGE OF SPECIALIZED BEHAVIORAL NEEDS. AS A COUNTY PROGRAM. WE CAN HARNESS OUR EXPERTISE IN THE PSYCHOSOCIAL MODELS OF RECOVERY. TO PRIORITIZE THE NEEDS OF THE MOST UNDERSERVED. BUT OUR SYSTEM IS ALSO POSITION TO SERVE THOSE WHO MAY BE AT RISK OF DEVELOPING SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS. OUR PROGRAMS ARE SUPPORTED THROUGH A COMBINATION AT ME TO SAY MEDIC HOW. FEDERAL STATE AND COUNTY FUNDING STREAMS. WELL IT'S CHALLENGING TO UNDERSTAND EXACTLY HOW THE MONEY FLOWS FOR THOSE OF US IN THE FIELD LIKE ME. THAT ARE DIRECTLY WORKING WITH CHILDREN AND FAMILIES. WHAT I DO UNDERSTAND IS THAT OUR SERVICES ARE NOT LIMITED? TO ONE THEY'RE NOT LIMITED TO ONE GROUP OF INSURANCE OR ANOTHER. WE CAN COVER CLIENTS ARE UNDOCUMENTED AND WE CAN HELP THEM FIND MEDI CAL AND GAIN MEDI CAL. THE DOOR TO THE COUNTY SERVICES OPEN ONCE A NEED IS IDENTIFIED. CAN WE DO BETTER TO SERVE THE POPULATIONS ABSOLUTELY I BELIEVE WE CAN ALWAYS DO THAT DO BETTER. CALIFORNIA IS IN NEED OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SYSTEM TRANSFORMATION AND EVOLUTION. IT'S A NEED AT STATE LEVEL LEADERSHIP. AS THEIR USE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WORK FORCE BELIEVES THAT WE NEED TO APPRECIATE THE BROADER ROLE. THE COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH AND LEVERAGE. AND LEVERAGE THE EXPERIENCE AND EXPERTISE OF THE COUNTIES AND ANY FUTURE TRANSFORMATION. FOR EXAMPLES COUNTIES IN THE STATE. NEED TO WORK TOGETHER TO ENSURE THERE'S A COMMON CLEARLY ARTICULATED MINIMUM INSTEAD OF COUNTY BEHAVIORAL SERVICES. AND STANDARDS. SHIFTING THE BY SHIFTING THE FINANCIAL RISK AND RESPONSIBILITY. OF CARING FOR THOSE WHO ARE SEVERELY AND PERSISTENTLY MENTALLY ILL RISK UNDERMINING THE INNOVATION THAT COUNTIES ARE SPEARHEADING. WE ALSO NEED TO DO MORE TO INTEGRATE MENTAL HEALTH ADDICTION AND PHYSICAL HEALTH SERVICES. WE NEED TO DO THIS AT THE PROVIDER LEVEL WITH AN EMPHASIS ON BUILDING OUT A PLAN FOR INVESTING IN A RENEWED. COMMUNITY BASED CONTINUUM OF CARE. THE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SYSTEM. MAY NOT BE PERFECT BUT THE COUNTY'S VISION. INNOVATION POTENTIAL AND INITIATIVES THERE. WE SEE WHAT'S POSSIBLE AT THE COUNTY LEVEL. WE SEE THAT IN OUR COOLEY COLOCATED FACILITIES AND DCFS WE SEE THAT WITH JUVENILE JUSTICE WE SEE THAT WITH MY PROGRAM AND EIGHTY WE NEED TO BUILD ON THE MOMENTUM OF WHAT THE COUNTY IT'S ALREADY PROVIDE. AN INCREASE THE VENUES IN CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE CLIENTS OR SERVICE. COUNTIES MEET PEOPLE WHERE THEY ARE IF ANYTHING OF MY EXAMPLES HAVE SHOWN THAT. WHAT I WANT TO LEAVE YOU WITH TODAY IS THAT WHILE SO MUCH OF WHAT WE DO IMPACTS MEDI CAL BENEFICIARIES THE WORK IS SO MUCH MORE? I WORK GOES WELL BEYOND THE FOUR WALLS OF A CLINIC THAT MANY OF OUR CLIENTS ARE GONNA WALK INTO ANYWAY. IT GOES BEYOND INSURANCE ELIGIBILITY AND THE MEDICAL NEEDS OF OUR CONSUMERS WE'RE A SAFETY NET AND SUPPORT. INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE LIVING WITH MENTAL ILLNESS AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE. WITH YOUR HELP WE CAN DO MORE TO MODERNIZE AN UPDATE OUR COUNTY SYSTEM FOR HERE REAL HELL. AND MAKE SURE SUPPORT IMPROVED OVERALL HEALTH SO THE CARE IS MORE APPROPRIATELY INTEGRATED. FOR THE POPULATIONS WE SERVE WE'RE ALREADY WORKING TO INTEGRATE. NOT JUST BETWEEN MENTAL HEALTH AND PHYSICAL HEALTH BUT ALSO WITH SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS. SOCIAL SERVICE HOUSING AND MANY OTHER ASPECTS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU TO ALL OF YOU -- THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE I I WOULD. I APPRECIATE THE TESTIMONY FROM BOTH -- FROM -- A SCAM AND FROM A COMMUNICATOR I KNOW USE -- IN MY DISTRICT HERE SACRAMENTO AND ALSO FROM -- ALTMAN HEALTH PLAN SAN MATTEO I WOULD NOTE THAT BOTH. IF YOU ARE IN COUNTY IS THAT SINCE THE OPERATING COUNTY ORGANIZED HEALTH SYSTEM PARTNERSHIP BE A MULTI COUNTY. SO FORTH -- SO YOU PERHAPS CAN'T QUITE ANSWER QUESTION. I KNOW THAT -- DOCKED BUNCH HERE IN A TWO PLAN MODEL ALTHOUGH YOU KNOW YOU'RE NOT RUNNING THAT. THE I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE NOT ADMINISTRATIVE CAPACITY IN PART I JUST DO WONDER ABOUT THIS INTERFACE WHEN YEAH THAT ONE WOULD ARGUE THAT PERHAPS -- AND WILL AND AND COUNTY ORGANIZED HEALTH SYSTEMS WHERE YOU HAVE ESSENTIALLY YOU HAVE COUNTY WE'RE GONNA HELP AND THERE'S A GREATER OPPORTUNITY ARE THERE MAY BE GREATER EASE AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO BRING THE TWO TOGETHER WHERE AS? WELL I ALWAYS COURSE IT'S OWN UNIQUE THING WITH. THE GIVEN ITS SIZE BUT ANY OF IT TO PLAN MODEL WITH THE YOU KNOW LA CARE. HEALTH NET AND THEN YOU HAVE MULTIPLE SUBCONTRACTS AT CETERA AND SO HOW DOES A COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM THEN MATCH UP AGAINST THAT OR DO YOU HAVE A THE SIDE. THE TERMS OF THE THAT IS A TERMS OF TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE AND IT'S NOT YOU KNOW WE TALK ABOUT INTEGRATION BETWEEN. SUBSTANCE USE AND MENTAL HEALTH WE TALK ABOUT INTEGRATION BETWEEN THE HEALTH PLAN WHICH IS MY OLD. ADDRESS AND THIS GUY AND THEN WE TALKED ABOUT AND THEN AND THEN HOW. AND THEN JUST THE PHYSICAL HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH SO -- AT SO I GUESS IN SOME SENSES ANY OBSERVATIONS FROM HEARING FROM YOUR COLLEAGUES IN OTHER COUNTIES -- YOUR EXPERIENCE IN LA -- AND TURN IN TERMS OF HOW WE DO THIS INTEGRATION WHEN YOU HAVE -- AND AND AND PLACES AND WE DON'T HAVE THAT IN PLACES WHERE YOU DON'T HAVE -- BASICALLY JUST THE NEED TO ENTITIES THE COME TOGETHER I MEAN I REALIZE MAYBE MORE BUT TWO MAJOR ENTITIES COME TOGETHER. WELL. YOU KNOW I I DO COME FROM A CO HSN I AGREE IT'S MUCH EASIER ON AND SEE WHAT JUST COUNTY I DON'T THINK IT'S IMPOSSIBLE -- I THINK IT'S DEFINITELY MORE COMPLICATED NOTHING'S POSSIBLE BUT BUT WELL I THINK -- I'M THINKING ABOUT SAN DIEGO WHICH HAS I THINK IT'S SEVEN HEALTH PLANS ON BECAUSE THE GEOGRAPHIC MANAGE CARE LIKE SACRAMENTO. AN ARM IN SAN DIEGO -- HAS DONE INTEREST YOU WORK OVER THE YEARS AND IT'S ANOTHER AREA BUT IT'S AN L. TSS LONG TERM SERVICE SUPPORT WITH THEY'VE ORGANIZES A COUNTY. AND THEY HAVE ON RELATIONSHIPS WITH ALL THE HEALTH PLANS AND I THINK IT. IT TAKES A LOT OF WORK BUT I THINK WHERE -- YOU CAN HAVE A STANDARD COUNTY PROCESS AND THEN WORK WITH THE VARIOUS -- PLANTS -- SO I I WOULDN'T GIVE UP ON IT ENTIRELY MAYBE WANNA START WITH THE CHS COUNTIES BUT I THINK THERE'S SOME IMMIGRATION WORK THAT HAS GONE ON IN OTHER AREAS NOT PAPER HEALTH THAT MIGHT BE VERY INSTRUCTIVE TO LOOK AT MORE. MORE DEEPLY. HE'S MADE MAYBE SOME STATE MANDATES WOULD HELP. WITHOUT REGARD TO GET COUNTY YEAH I'M IN SACRAMENTO WE HAVE GMC WE HAVE SIX HEALTH PLANS RIGHT. AND IT'S NOT THERE THEIR RELATIONSHIP STRICTLY WITH THE STATE CELL THAT'S PROBLEMATIC BUT ANY OKAY. ANY OTHER COMMENTS ON THAT AND THE LA YEAH. I KNOW YOU'RE NOT YOU'RE BEHALF OF ELEMENTAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT. THAT'S A DIFFICULT QUESTION AND I CAN ONLY SPEAK FROM FROM MY EXPERIENCE AND I KNOW JUST INDIVIDUALLY IN WITH MY PROGRAM WHEN I WHEN THINGS COME UP I DON'T. I DON'T THINK HEALTH PLANS I I THINK CLINICALLY AND SO WHEN I SAY WE HAVE A WHATEVER IT TAKES MENTALITY THAT'S WHAT WE DO IS SO IF SOMEONE HAS HAS HEALTHCARE NEEDS THAT'S THAT'S CASE MANAGEMENT. WE JUST GO WE FIND THE HEALTH PLAN WE TAKE THEM THERE WE GET REFERRALS FROM BEGAN WE FOLLOW AT SO IT'S HARD FOR ME BECAUSE I DON'T I DON'T THINK AND AND ADMINISTRATIVELY AND IN TERMS OF THIS HEALTH PLAN OR IT JUST SOUNDS LIKE CASE MANAGEMENT. AND WE FOLLOW UP WHERE WE NEED. WE WE CERTAINLY HEARD FROM THE PREVIOUS PANEL THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE LITERALLY STUCK IN BETWEEN WE HEARD FROM MY MY COLLEAGUES THAT HAPPENED TO ONE OF THE SO. I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT YEAH I I I I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND I MEAN AS A FELLOW HEALTH PROFESSIONAL WERE ON THE GROUND WHICH WE WE TRY TO DO THAT RIGHT WE WE DON'T TRY TO SAY WHICH HEALTH PLAN BUT ULTIMATELY YOU DO RUN UP AGAINST THE WHO'S GOING TO PAY. FOR IT AND SO FORTH AND WHOSE GOOD FOR ON FRANKLY WHEN THE REASONS I AND IF FOR ANY FOR THE STATE LEGISLATURE WAS TRYING TO RECESSION WE HAD I HAD PATIENTS TO I MAINLY FOCUS ON CHILDREN WITH LEARNING AND FEARFUL DISORDERS -- THAT -- I PATIENTS GOT GOT STOCK AND AND DOES SO AS MUCH AS I WANTED TO BE AS A AS A SOMEONE ON THE FRONT LINES -- TO BE EIGHT LET'S NOT PRETEND THE PROBLEM PAY FOR IT RIGHT IS GOING TO COVER IT HE'S GONNA ACCEPT THEM BECAUSE IF PEOPLE ARE GOING TO GET PAID. IT WAS REALLY HARD TO GET THEM CARE SO. THANK YOU. I FIND IT IT'S ACTUALLY EASY EASIER FOR US WITH THE COUNTY TO FIGURE OUT WHO'S GOING TO PAY FOR IT AND HOW TO PAY FOR IT. WITH OUR SPECIFIC PROGRAM WE'VE ACTUALLY HAD MORE TROUBLE WITH CLIENTS TO A PRIVATE INSURANCE BECAUSE I THINK IT IS SIMILAR TO WHAT THEY WERE SAYING EARLIER. WITH THE PRIVATE INSURANCE THE THE NEEDS THEY DON'T HAVE THE SERVICES THEY DON'T HAVE THE LEVEL OF TREATMENT THAT'S NEEDED. SO WE CAN FIGURE OUT A WAY TO PAY FOR IT WITH OUR OUR COUNTY ARE INDIGENT FINDS BUT THEN ONCE WE NEED TO REFER ON TO THE CONTRACT THAT THEY WERE IN THE SAME BOAT. THAT NO ONE CAN DO IT. I THANK YOU -- I I KNOW WE'VE BEEN TAKING SOME NOTES I THINK WE'LL HAVE SOME FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS FOR FOR YOU AS WELL BUT I DID AT ONE QUESTION DID HAVE -- THAT -- AS IN LISTENING -- TO MISS OUR QUEST TALK ABOUT BEACON YOU YOU YOU SAID TO BE A PROVIDE SERVICES FOR ABOUT A THIRD OF THE MEDI CAL. AND OVER THREE MILLION MEDI CAL BENEFICIARIES SO WE WORK SO WORK WE CONTRACT WITH EIGHT MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE PLANS WHOSE TOTAL MEMBERSHIP. IS MORE THAN THREE MILLION MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES. AND YOU HAVE FIFTY SIX COUNTIES THAT DO THINGS FIFTIES. SIX TWENTY FIVE OR TWENTY FIVE COUNTIES THEY DO THINGS. TWENTY FIVE DIFFERENT WAYS SO THAT MAKES IT TO TO DO TO DEAL WITH -- IS THAT IS THIS DELIVERY SYSTEM YOU NEED TO CALIFORNIA YOU DO DO YOU TO WORK IN OTHER STATES YES SO WE WORK WITH MEDICAID. BUT THIRTY MILLION MEDICAID LIVES IN TWENTY STATES -- CALIFORNIA'S BIFURCATION ON IMPAIRMENT LEVELS IS UNIQUE AND THE ONLY OTHER STATE THAT I'M PERSONALLY AWARE OF THAT USED TO DO THAT WAS WASHINGTON STATE. IN WASHINGTON STATE IS IN AN ACTIVE -- FIVE YEAR TRANSITION PLAN -- FRONT TO MOVE ALL OF THAT THE PAPER HEALTH BENEFITS THAT WERE CARVED OUT. TO REGIONAL COUNTY LIKE ENTITIES INTO THE MEDICARE MEDICAID MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS. THEY'RE ON IN BEACON DOES WORK THERE BUT OUR ROLE THERE IS ACTUALLY TO MANAGE THE CRISIS SYSTEM ON BEHALF OF AN ENTIRE COMMUNITY. BECAUSE ONE THING TO THINK ABOUT IF YOU'RE GONNA CARVIN MEDICAID BENEFITS INTO MANAGED CARE PLAN. THERE'S A LOT OF OTHER PUBLIC. A FEDERALLY FUNDED MHSAA FUNDED DIFFERENT SERVICES THAT STILL SORT OF WORK TOGETHER TO BRAID. IN A BRAID TOGETHER TO MAKE AN ENTIRE CONTINUUM OF CARE AND A CRISIS SYSTEM NEEDS TO BE IN PLACE FOR EVERYBODY IN THE COMMUNITY. REGARDLESS OF WHO PAYS FOR THEIR SERVICES INTERCEPT WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM SCHOOLS. IN A JUVENILE DETENTION SAID SAID EXTRA COMPLICATION WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT CARVING AND SERVICES -- BUT WASHINGTON HAS HAD -- INITIAL -- POSITIVE SUCCESS FROM ITS -- PROCESS OF OUR GREAT GREAT WELL THANK YOU AGAIN I I KNOW BECAUSE IT WE WHAT WE LIKELY HAVE FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS WHICH WILL REACH OUT TO YOU ALL AGAIN SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH REALLY REALLY CRESCENTA. WE GET A MOVE ON TO PANEL TH BE OF PART -- THREE OUR NEXT OUR NEXT SPEAKERS -- PLEASE PLEASE COME ON UP BUT DOCTOR SHANNON SU -- WHO'S FROM UC DAVIS SCHOOL OF MEDICINE. MIKE DISHONORABLE IS THE CEO FOR SIERRA VISTA HOSPITAL. AND KAREN SAVAGE SAYING ONE WHO'S THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA PAN HAVE THE PAN ETHNIC HEALTH NETWORK SO. PLEASE COME ON A GOOD AFTERNOON -- I'M SHANNON SO AS YOU SAID IN FROM UC DAVIS I'M ACTUALLY HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA PSYCHIATRIC ASSOCIATION IS CO CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE ON INTEGRATED CARE -- I ALSO WEAR A NUMBER OF OTHER HATS -- THAT'LL EXPLAIN JUST TO GIVE YOU SOME CONTEXT OF WHY AND I'M HERE TODAY AND WHY I'M PASSIONATE ABOUT THINGS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT -- I AM ALSO THE CO DIRECTOR FOR THE UC IRVINE UC DAVIS STREET NEW TRAINERS PRIMARY CARE PSYCHIATRY FELLOWSHIP. WHICH TRAINS PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS PHYSICIANS NURSE PRACTITIONERS AND PHYSICIAN ASSISTANTS IN PROVIDING MENTAL HEALTH CARE IN THE PRIMARY CARE SETTING. THIS IS SEEKING QUALIFIED MEDICAL -- WHAT THEY'RE ALREADY RUNNING INTO AND WHAT THEY FEEL INSUFFICIENTLY PREPARED -- FOR I'M ALSO THE PROGRAM DIRECTOR FOR THE UC DAVIS FAMILY MEDICINE PSYCHIATRY RESIDENCY TRAINING PROGRAM WHICH TRAINS TO RESIDENTS PER YEAR OVER A FIVE YEAR PERIOD -- TO BE DAHLE BOARDED IN FAMILY MEDICINE AND PSYCHIATRY IS I AM. UC DAVIS IS ONE OF ONLY TWO INSTITUTIONS IN THE COUNTRY THAT HAS BOTH IN INTERNAL MEDICINE PSYCHIATRY PROGRAM ANY FAMILY MEDICINE PSYCHIATRY RESIDENCY PROGRAM. AND THEN FINALLY I AM THE MEDICAL DIRECTOR OF SACRAMENTO COUNTY'S ONLY MENTAL HEALTH URGENT CARE WHICH OPENED IN NOVEMBER OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AND HAS SERVED OVER FOUR THOUSAND CLIENTS TO DATE. I'M I WANTED TO TALK TODAY ABOUT -- WOULD REITERATE A LOT OF POINTS OF COURSE THAT OTHER PEOPLE HAVE I AM NOT GOING TO TRAIN DELIVER THOSE BUT JUST TO LEND OUR SUPPORT AS WELL. OF COURSE WE TALKED A LOT ABOUT INTEGRATING SUBSTANCE USE PHYSICAL CARE WITH MENTAL HEALTH CARE. AND THAT'S AN AREA THAT'S VERY NEAR AND DEAR TO MY HEART BECAUSE AS A COMBINED TRAINED PHYSICIAN. THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO DO THAT'S ONE OF ONE OF THE SERVICES THEY WANT TO PROVIDE THE PEOPLE I WANT TO PROVIDE A ONE STOP SHOP. I ALSO REALIZE THOUGH THAT NOT EVERYBODY CAN PROVIDE EVERYTHING IN ONE BODY. AND SO THEREFORE WE WANT TO SUPPORT OUR FQHCS ESPECIALLY THAT WANT TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES IN ONE STOP FOR CLIENTS. BUT ARE BARRED FROM DOING SO BECAUSE OF THE CURRENT BILLING STRUCTURE AND THE CALIFORNIA REALLY NEEDS AN EXEMPTION TO ALLOW FQHCS TO BE ABLE TO BILL FOR MORE THAN ONE SERVICE IN ONE DAY -- OFFERED BY DIFFERENT PEOPLE -- ALSO THE TRANSITION BETWEEN. DIFFERENT SYSTEMS OF CARE WE SEE THIS DAILY IN THE MENTAL HEALTH URGENT ARE PEOPLE ARE DISCHARGED FROM HOSPITALS DISCHARGED FROM PRISONS AND JAILS. TO PRETTY MUCH NO CARE -- THEY WIND UP IN MY URGENT CARE BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO GO OR THEY DIDN'T GET CONNECTED WHERE THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO LAND. ON THEIR OUT OF MEDICATIONS THEY'RE FACING POTENTIALLY A RE HOSPITALIZATION -- OR FUTURE INCARCERATIONS SO WE REALLY NEED TO DO BETTER IN TERMS OF LINKING THESE PEOPLE OF OUTPATIENT SERVICES AND PREVENTING THE NEXT RECURRENCE AS THESE -- SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH -- AND MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS NEED TO BE ABLE TO SEAMLESSLY TRANSITION PATIENTS BACK AND FORTH -- RIGHT NOW WE'VE WE'VE TALKED A LOT ABOUT OF THE DAY. THE SILENCE ESSENTIALLY THAT EXISTS BETWEEN THOSE DIFFERENT AGENCIES. AND THEN OF LOTS AND LOTS OF TALK ABOUT THE BILLING REGULATIONS DOCUMENTATION THAT MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT FOR ALL OF US IS AS PROVIDERS. TO DO OUR JOBS TO SERVE CLIENTS TO WORK TOWARDS BETTER OUTCOMES. AND YOUR HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS AND I'M NOT JUST SPEAKING HERE ABOUT PHYSICIANS BUT ALL HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS ARE ARE FACING INCREASING DEBT LOADS. THEY'RE GOING INTO -- JOBS WHERE THEY CAN MAKE MORE MONEY. AND PSYCHIATRY OR MENTAL HEALTH IS NOT NECESSARILY SEEN AS ONE OF THOSE SPECIALTIES. ON SO THERE'S SEND FINANCIAL STIGMA THERE SOMETIMES SUN -- SOCIAL STIGMA THAT GOES ALONG WITH GOING INTO MENTAL HEALTH WE HAVE TO OVERCOME. IN ORDER TO ATTRACT PEOPLE INTO DOING THIS WORK THAT IS SO DESPERATELY NEEDED -- AND THEN FINALLY AS THE FEDERAL I AM THE WAIVER THAT'S SOMETHING THAT AS MENTIONED EARLIER -- BUT IS ANOTHER AVENUE BY WHICH WE CAN CAPTURE SOME FEDERAL MONEY TO BE ABLE TO HELP PAY FOR SERVICES THAT COUNTIES ARE ALREADY HAVING TO PAY. FOR BUT THEY'RE HAVING TO PAY FOR IT IN AN IN AN UNPLANNED WAY -- AND THEN NOT BEING ABLE TO USE THEIR OWN DOLLARS TO PERHAPS PERCENT HOSPITALIZATIONS. SO APPLYING FOR THE FEDERAL ANTI WAIVER AND AND DRAWING DOWN SOME OF THOSE FEDERAL FUNDS WOULD BE HELPFUL AND IN. HELPING OFFSET SOME OF THESE COSTS THAT WERE LIKE I SAID ARI EXPENDING [inaudible] CELL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. BY USING THIS. ONE GOOD AFTERNOON X.. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT TO YOU TODAY MY NAME'S MIKE'S HONOR AND CEO IS HERE MISTER HOSPITAL IN SACRAMENTO WHERE -- HUNDRED SEVENTY ONE BAD FREESTANDING PSYCHIATRIC FACILITY. WE WERE SEVENTY TWO BEDS WE OPENED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX SO WE'VE SEEN SIGNIFICANT GROWTH OVER THE LAST REALLY THE LAST TEN YEARS OR SO -- WE ADMIT ABOUTSIX THOUSAND PATIENTS A YEAR BOTH ADULTS AND ADOLESCENTS 90% OF THOSE ARE MORE ON A FIFTY ONE FIFTY SO WITH THE SERVICE WE PROVIDE FALLS INTO THAT SEVERELY. GENERALLY SEVERELY MENTALLY ILL SPECIALLY MENTAL HEALTH -- WE EMPLOY ABOUT THREE HUNDRED FIFTY FULL TIME AND PART TIME STAFF WE CONTRACT WITH TWENTY FIVE PLUS PSYCHIATRIST AND AND MEDICAL DOCTORS. AND ABOUT. AVERAGE LIKE TO STAYS ABOUT TEN DAYS WHICH I'VE BEEN AT THE FACILITY SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND TEN IT WAS CLOSER TO SIX OR SEVEN WHEN I GOT THERE SO IT'S REALLY EXTENDED. OVER THE OVER THE LAST EIGHT OR NINE YEARS. WHAT'S WORKING WELL WITHIN THE pWANT TO SAY I DID READ THIS BEFORE I CAME THIS WAS AN EXCELLENT OVERVIEW -- IS REALLY INFORMATIVE AND I AND I THOUGHT ILLUSTRATED. SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE BUT ALSO THE OVERALL SYSTEM SO THAT WAS THAT WAS NICE WORK WHAT'S WORKING WELL WITHIN THE SYSTEM I I THINK THE FACT THAT THAT MEDI CAL -- COVERS THIRTEEN MILLION PEOPLE ON THE FACT THAT THE ACA IN THE COVERAGES. AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL WERE EXTENDED AT THE STATE LEVEL NEAR EVERYTHING THAT THE STATE IS DONE. TO MAINTAIN THAT COVERAGE AND EXTEND IT. TO AS MANY PEOPLE AS IT HAS I THINK IS A WONDERFUL THING -- THE OTHER THING I THINK IS WORKING WELL FROM MY PERSPECTIVE IT IS. THAT WANT SOMEBODY IS ADMITTED TO MY HOSPITAL -- THE SERVICES THAT THEY RECEIVE WHETHER THEY HAVE. KAISER. ANTHEM AT NASA OR MEDICARE. IT'S IT'S EXCELLENT CARE THE SERVICE IS CONSISTENT. IT IS -- EACH PATIENT IS TREATED THE SAME REGARDLESS OF FUNDING SO IN THAT SENSE MEDI CAL IN THE ACCESS THAT IT'S OPENED UP. TO PROVIDERS -- IS IS GOOD IT'S JUST. GAINING THE ACCESS TO THE CARE WHICH IS WHERE THE RUB IS -- I'M GONNA PRESENT THEM OR MY EXPERIENCE IS FROM THE LENS OF A HOSPITAL THAT HAS ADMITTED PATIENTS IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN FROM THIRTY EIGHT DIFFERENT COUNTIES OF THE FIFTY SIX OR FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES FIFTY SIX HEALTH PLANS SO. WE WE LITERALLY HAVE. A WITH A WIDE RANGE OF EXPERIENCE IN DEALING WITH THE INCONSISTENCIES THAT YOU HAVE HEARD MUCH TESTIMONY ABOUT. SO WHAT IS NOT WORKING WELL YOU'VE GOT A A DISJOINTED FRAGMENTED SYSTEM -- YOU ALSO HAVE A SISTER THEY LEAVE. A HOSPITAL SETTING AGAIN COMING TO US IN A FIFTY ONE FIFTY SITUATION. THEIR POST DISCHARGE SUPPORT AND SERVICES AVAILABLE TO THE MEDI CAL BENEFICIARIES. IS LACKING. BOTTOM LINE AND THEN MAINTAINING ELIGIBILITY -- I THINK THERE'S WORK TO COULD BE DONE FOR FOLKS FOLKS WITH MENTAL ILLNESS -- AND FOLKS ENROLLED IN MEDICARE ON SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT GO. HAND IN HAND WITH BOTH REALITIES. THE REQUIREMENTS TO MAINTAIN COVERAGE IN MEDI CAL IN THE PAPERWORK IT NEEDS TO BE DONE IN THE QUARTERLY TIME LINES AND WHAT NOT. IT'S IT'S IT'S IT'S INHERENTLY -- GONNA BE HARDER FOR SOMEBODY TO MAINTAIN THEIR MEDICAL COVERAGE VERSUS THOSE I THINK WITHOUT CHRONIC MENTAL ILLNESS -- THE DELIVERY SYSTEM BEING FRAGMENTED AND CHALLENGING. AT BEST IS REALLY A REFLECTION OF THE COUNTY BY COUNTY I CAN GO INTO SPECIFIC EXAMPLES BUT BOTTOM LINE IS WE DEAL WITH EACH COUNTY DIFFERENTLY. IN IN HOW PATIENTS ARE ADMITTED -- IN HOW PATIENTS ARE UTILIZATION REVIEW THAT WE DO WITH THE COUNTY IS AN ON GOING BASIS HOW WE BUILD THE COUNTIES. HOW WE -- THE FORMS THAT WE USE MAY BE CONSISTENT FROM ONE COUNTY TO THE NEXT BUT ONE COUNTY MAY SAY WE WANT THIS OVAL FILLED IN IN THE NEXT COUNTY SAYS NO YOU DON'T FEEL AND THAT ALL VOTES LITERALLY DOWN TO THAT LEVEL OF DETAIL -- IN IN THAT LACK OF CONSISTENCY AS A PROVIDER. WHERE I'VE GOT? HELLO TWENTY TO TWENTY FIVE FULL TIME EMPLOYEES IS DEALING WITH IT. IS IS DIFFICULT IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE I COULD IMAGINE WHAT IT'S LIKE FOR THE CONSUMER. SO SO THAT'S A REAL PROBLEM THAT LACK OF CONSISTENCY FROM COUNTY TO COUNTY -- THE POST DISCHARGE SERVICES. IN SUPPORT -- WE DO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY -- TO TO OF VALUE EIGHT IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE COUNTY PATIENTS THAT. THEIR SEVERITY LEVEL IN THEIR NEED FOR OUT PAY ABOUT A THIRD OF OUR PATIENTS OF THE SIX THOUSAND I MENTIONED BEFORE THAT ARE NEEDED. TWO THOUSAND OR SO WERE MEDI CAL. THE COUNTY WE WILL EVALUATE THE NEED FOR FOLLOW UP SERVICES IN THAT MEDI CAL POPULATION ABOUT A THIRD QUALIFY FOR THE INTENSIVE SERVICES A TURNING POINT -- TELECARE THOSE TYPE OF SERVICES BUT TWO THIRDS DO NOT SO THERE'S TWO THIRDS OF THE OF THE MEDI CAL. PATIENTS ARE ADMITTED TO SERVICE ARE GOING TO BE DISCHARGED WITHOUT ACCESS TO IMMEDIATE FOLLOW ABOUT PATIENT CARE LIKE PARTIAL HOSPITALIZATION INTENSIVE OUTPATIENT SERVICES. AND LIKELY WILL NOT BE SEEN BY PROVIDER FOR THIRTY DAYS OR MORE -- AND THEN THE LAST PIECE ABOUT WHAT'S NOT WORKING WELL AS THE ELIGIBILITY PIECES I MENTION BEFORE JUST. BY -- AS WE SPEAK EVERITT TO PATIENTS AT THEIR MEDI CAL HAS EXPIRED FEBRUARYTWENTY EIGHTH MARCH FIRST THEY'RE NO LONGER ENROLLED IN MEDICARE NOW -- WE DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO GET THEM REINSTATED IN MEDI CAL TO VARYING LEVELS OF SUCCESS BUT THEY WILL. THERE'S A CHANCE THEY WILL DISCHARGE WITH NO MEDICAL MILK NO MEDICAL COVERAGE IN A FAX SO WHAT CAN WE DO. I THINK A DOCTOR ANY SYSTEM WHETHER IT'S THROUGH THE ELEVEN FIFTEEN BE WAIVER -- BUT ANY SYSTEM THAT BRINGS GREATER ACCOUNTABILITY AND AND AND REDUCES THE INCONSISTENCY FROM COUNTY TO COUNTY AND IF THAT'S DONE THROUGH. THE COUNTIES GETTING PAID ON A CAPITATED BASIS ARE USING A CARVIN SYSTEM THAT ALLOWS YOU TO TAP INTO THE FEDERAL MATCHING DOLLARS. I THINK THAT NEEDS TO BE -- NOT ONLY FINANCIALLY WOULD MAKE SENSE BUT IT WOULD BRING CONSISTENCY TO THE TO THE TO THE SYSTEM AND THIS REPORT MENTIONED THAT ANY PROPOSAL. TO TO GET THE WAIVER DAHLE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CMS NEEDS TO BE BUDGET NEUTRAL. I WOULD PROPOSE THAT YOU COULD INCLUDE IN THE APPLICATION -- THE THE DEVELOPMENT OF CRISIS INTERVENTION SERVICES ARE MORE -- PARTIAL HOSPITALIZATION OR I'LL OUTPATIENT SERVICES TO PREVENT PEOPLE FROM GETTING INTO THE HOSPITAL WHICH I THINK WOULD OVERALL REDUCE THE INPATIENT MISSIONS AND COULD POTENTIALLY BE BUDGET NEUTRAL -- THE LAST THING I WOULD SAY IS ANYTHING THAT CAN BE DONE BY THE STATE IN REDUCING THE THE REQUIREMENTS TO MAINTAIN ELIGIBILITY FOR THOSE THE SEVERELY MENTALLY ILL PATIENTS -- I WOULD APPRECIATE I THINK THEY SHOULD TAKE A LOOK AT DOING THAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. FOR THANKS AT MY NAME'S KAREN SAVAGE AND WITH THE CALIFORNIA PAN ETHNIC HEALTH NETWORK WHERE STATEWIDE MULTI CULTURAL HEALTH ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION AND WE WORK ON A NUMBER OF HEALTH CARE ISSUES -- INCLUDING MENTAL HEALTH THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TODAY. AND I WANT TO START OFF BY SHARING SOME DATA -- THAT'S BEING PASSED AROUND SO YOU HAVE THE VISUAL I'M IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN WE SPONSORED LEGISLATION -- BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER ARAMBULA TO REQUIRE DH CS TO REPORT OUT ON COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH -- WITH DEMOGRAPHIC INDICATOR SO BY RACE ETHNICITY LANGUAGE IT CETERA AND SO THIS IS RELATIVELY NEW DATA THE DEPARTMENT JUST RELEASED IT I'M AT THE END OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUT THERE'S A FEW THINGS THAT WE'VE ALREADY LEARNED FROM LOOKING AT IT THAT I THINK ARE IMPORTANT TO KNOW. SO THE FIRST IS THAT MENTAL HEALTH UTILIZATION SEC ISLANDER CONSUMERS HAVING THE LOW IS BY FAR THE LOWEST UTILIZATION RATES. AND I MISTER MAC EXPLAINED REALLY WELL SORT OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PENETRATION RATE AND THE ENGAGEMENT RATE WE ALSO SEE DISPARITIES WHEN WE LOOK AT SORT OF THE DROP OFF FROM THE PENETRATION RATE TO THE ENGAGEMENT RATE AND THERE'S THE LARGEST DROP OFF FROM PEOPLE WHO ARE POTENTIALLY. JUST AS FAST AND NOT ENGAGED IN TREATMENT FOR BLACK CONSUMERS SO WE THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE. TO MENTAL HEALTH UTILIZATION ALSO VARIES BY LANGUAGE AS YOU CAN SEE BY THE GRAPH YOU HAVE IN FRONT OF YOU WITH ONLY ABOUT 1% OF BENEFICIARIES WHOSE PRIMARY LANGUAGE IS NOT ENGLISH BEING CAN ENGAGED IN SERVICES. I'M AND THERE'S OTHER LANGUAGES THAT HAVE EVEN SMALLER NUMBERS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE BEING ENGAGE NUMBER SO SMALL THAT THEY CAN'T BE PUBLICLY REPORTED. AND I THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT WHILE THERE ARE MANY IMPORTANT EFFORTS UNDER WAY THERE'S INDICATIONS THAT DISPARITIES ARE ACTUALLY NOT. I'M GETTING SMALLER OVER TIME AND SO YOU CAN SEE WE GAVE THE EXAMPLE OF LANGUAGE BUT THE DISPARITY BETWEEN ENGLISH PRIMARY ENGLISH SPEAKERS. AND I PRIMARY NON ENGLISH SPEAKERS IS ACTUALLY REMAINED FAIRLY CONSISTENT FROM TWENTY THIRTEEN TO TWENTY SEVENTEEN WHICH I THINK IT'S DISAPPOINTING. I'M AND THEN FINALLY WHEN WE LOOK AT OUTCOMES WOULD JUST AGAIN GIVEN ONE EXAMPLE -- BUT THE TIME IT TAKES FOR SOMEONE TO STEP DOWN FROM AN INPATIENT HOSPITALIZATION TO A LOWER LEVEL OF KERR VARIES BY RACE WITH BLACK CONSUMERS HAVING A CONSIDERABLY LONGER AVERAGE TIME. TO BE DISCHARGED FROM INPATIENT SETTING AND ENGAGE IN FOLLOW UP CARE. AND I WOULD NOTE AGAIN AT THE STATE THAT ONLY ONLY LOOKS AT COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH AND UNFORTUNATELY WE DON'T HAVE THE SAME LEVEL OF SPECIFICITY CURRENTLY AVAILABLE. ON THE MANAGED CARE SITES THAT WOULD BE ONE RECOMMENDATION IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN DO THIS KIND OF ANALYSIS ON THE MANAGED CARE SIDE. I DO THINK THAT THE ANALYSIS DID A AT THE BACKGROUND DID A REALLY NICE JOB OF TALKING ABOUT SORT OF WHAT WE EXPECT TO SEE IN TERMS OF UTILIZATION IN COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH AND SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH. AND WHAT WE EXPECT TO SEE IN THE MANAGED CARE PLAN HOW MEMBERS WHO SHOULD BE ACCESSING CARE FROM THEIR HEALTH PLAN BECAUSE OF THE LEVEL. OF I NEED THAT THE HEALTH PLAN SHOULD BE ADDRESSING AND YET THE UTILIZATION READ HER RATES ARE ACTUALLY FAIRLY COMPARABLE SO WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE MANAGED CARE BENEFIT IS STILL SORT OF NEW. BUT BUT I THINK WE'RE REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT DO PEOPLE KNOW THAT THAT'S A BENEFIT TO PEOPLE KNOW HOW TO ACCESS IT. AND SO IF YOU RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE HAVE I'M ONE IS TO LEVERAGE THE STRENGTH OF COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH. I'M TO MEET THE NEEDS OF CONSUMERS WHO HAVE COMPLEX MENTAL HEALTH PHYSICAL HEALTH NEEDS AS WELL AS THOSE WERE NOT MEDICAL MEDI CAL ELIGIBLE AND DOCTOR BUNCH DID A REALLY NICE JOB SO I WON'T REITERATE OF TALKING AT SOME OF THE STRENGTH OF COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH. BUT I DID WANT TO TO TO SENATOR DRAWS AS EARLY EARLIER POINT TOUCH ON THE ACCESS FOR FOLKS WHO ARE UNDOCUMENTED -- WE'VE JUST CONDUCTED AT A RESEARCH PROJECT ON THAT WE'VE INTERVIEWED OVER A DOZEN COUNTIES AND I THINK THEY ARE YOU KNOW THERE'S BROAD AGREEMENT BROUGHT UNDERSTANDING THAT COUNTIES HAVE FLEXIBILITY WITH SOME OF THEIR FUNDS TO SERVE THIS POPULATION THAT IS. VASTLY UNDER SERVED HOWEVER I THINK THERE'S SOME REAL CHALLENGES FOR COUNTIES DOING THAT AND I THINK ONE IS SORT OF A POLITICAL PROBLEM OF MOST COUNTIES WILL TELL US YES IF SOMEONE GETS TO OUR DOOR WE WILL SERVE THEM WE HAVE FUNDS TO PAY FOR THEM. BUT THERE'S A NUMBER OF COUNTIES THAT ARE NOT DOING PROACTIVE OUT REACH TO UNDOCUMENTED COMMUNITIES BECAUSE THEY'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THE POLITICAL RAMIFICATIONS SO SOMEBODY NEVER FIND OUT THEY CAN GET SERVICES FROM YOU THEY'RE NOT GOING TO GET THREE OR DOOR. I'M SO WE WE DO BELIEVE THAT COULD BE CLARIFIED SOME ADDITIONAL BACKING FROM THE STATE WOULD BE HELPFUL THERE. I'M WE ALSO THINK THAT FOR BOTH COUNTIES AND HEALTH PLANS WE REALLY DO NEED TO MOVE TOWARDS THE MORE VALUE BASED ON PAYMENT METHODOLOGIES AND THAT IN PARTICULAR WHEN WE DO THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT DISPARITIES AND SO WE NEED TO DESEGREGATE OUR DATE OUT BECAUSE YOU CAN. MAKE OVERALL QUALITY IMPROVEMENT BUT ACTUALLY CONTINUE TO WORSEN DISPARITIES AS WE DO SEE IN SOME OF THE STATE US SO THAT WE NEED TO BE REALLY CAREFUL ABOUT THAT. I'M WE ALSO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO REVIEW THE OUTREACH MATERIALS THAT GO TO CONSUMERS BOTH FROM DH CS AND FROM HEALTH PLANS IN PARTICULAR BECAUSE WE KNOW MOST CONSUMERS WHO NEED THOSE SERVICES ARE NOT ACCESSING THEM SO THERE'S SOME KIND OF BREAKDOWN IS PROBABLY MULTIPLE BARRIERS. I'M AND THEN JUST A COUPLE MORE THINGS SO ONE IS TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR OUR CONTRACTED MANAGED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE WORKING WITH MANY OF OUR HEALTH PLANS. DO HAVE ADEQUATE NETWORKS ARE MEETING TIMELY ACCESS AND PARTICULARLY OUR MEETING TIMELY ACCESS TO INTERPRETER SERVICES WHICH IS A PLACE WHERE WE CONTINUE TO SEE A PROBLEM. I'M ON THAT END AND WE COMMENTS ABOUT SCREENING AND MEDICAL NECESSITY AND WOULD JUST ADD THAT IT DITION TO MAKING SURE THAT WE DO THE TRAUMA SCREENING AND WE BROUGHT IN THE MEDICAL NECESSITY DEFINITION. THAT WE NEED TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT TRANSLATIONS PARTICULAR PARTICULARLY FOR ASSESSMENT BECAUSE PARTICULAR TALKING MENTAL HEALTH NOT EVERYTHING HAS A DIRECT. TRANSLATION AND SO WE'VE ACTUALLY TALKED TO AN ORGANIZATION THAT HAS TO TRAIN THEIR MEMBERS ON WHAT THEY NEED TO SAY IN ORDER TO BE ELIGIBLE WHICH WORDS THEY NEED TO USE AND NOBODY SHOULD HAVE TO DO THAT. AND AND THEN JUST JUST TWO MORE THINGS ONE IS -- ALL COUNTIES HAVE A CULTURAL COMPETENCY ASSESSMENT PLAN THAT THEY PUT TOGETHER EVERY THREE YEARS AND THIS PLAN IS SUPPOSED TO BE SUBJECT TO REVIEW AND APPROVAL BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. BUT THIS IS AN AREA WHERE WE FEEL LIKE OVERSIGHT IS REALLY LACKING THAT THAT REVIEW AND APPROVAL HASN'T HAPPENED I'M IN MANY YEARS AND COUNTIES HAVEN'T BEEN SUPPORTED IN DEVELOPING THESE CRUCIAL PLANS. I'M AND THEN FINALLY WE THINK WE NEED AN OVER ARCHING STATE FRAMEWORK FOR HEALTHEQUITY THAT INCLUDES MENTAL HEALTH EQUITY AND REALLY LEVERAGES THE NEW POSITION OF THE CALIFORNIA SURGEON GENERAL SO THANKS SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME AND LOOKING FOR TO WORKING WITH YOU. GREAT THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH DOCTOR. QUESTION -- COUPLE COUPLE THINGS -- MISTERS HONOR ARE USED YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS -- WHEN WHEN PEOPLE ARE DISCHARGED AND WHETHER IT THERE MEDI CAL PATIENTS? HE SAID OF DID YOU SAY TWO THIRDS OF THEM HAVE NO ABILITY TO FOR FOLLOW UP TREATMENT. TWO THIRDS OF THEM OF THE MEDI CAL BENEFICIARIES -- WILL NOT QUALIFY. FOR THE MENTAL HEALTH PLAN OR THE COUNTY BASED SERVICES WHICH INCLUDE SOME OF THE INTENSIVE SERVICES THAT. JUST ABOUT ALL OF OUR PATIENTS REQUIRED BUT THOSE TWO THIRDS THAT DON'T QUALIFY DON'T. DON'T I GUESS SCORE AS BEING SEVERELY MENTALLY ILL ENOUGH TO ACCESS THOSE SERVICES. WILL NOT. THROUGH THE HEALTH PLANS ARE THE MANAGED CARE MEDI CAL THE PLANS AVAILABLE AS MY DISCHARGE PEOPLE TELL ME THERE'S NOT A THERE'S NOT ANY DAY TREATMENT OUR INTENSIVE OUTPATIENT SERVICES AVAILABLE FOR THOSE PATIENTS. SO THE COMBINATION OF OF THE LACK OF SERVICES AVAILABLE AND THEN THE WHETHER THEY CAN QUALIFY EVEN QUALIFY FOR THE SERVICES. CLINICALLY QUALIFY YEAH IF THEY'RE IF THEY'RE ILLNESS IF THEY ARE SICK ENOUGH ESSENTIALLY FOR THE LEVEL OF CARE. SO IN YOUR OPINION AFTER BEING RELEASED AFTER SIX TO TEN DAYS OF TREATMENT OR THEY THEY WELL ENOUGH LET LET ME -- LET ME JUST GIVE YOU -- TECH A COUNTERPOINT AND FOR KAISER -- ANTHEM BLUE CROSS AT AND THE EXPECTATION IS THAT THEY HAVE AN APPOINTMENT WITHIN SEVEN DAYS. AND IT'S OFTEN CLOSER TO FIVE DAYS FOR SOME FORM OF FOLLOW UP CARE MANY ARE REFERRED TO OUR OUTPATIENT SERVICES WE DO OFFER DAY TREATMENT IOP THERE'S OTHER PROVIDERS IN THE COMMUNITY TO DO. PRIVATE PROVIDERS -- I THINK THAT I DON'T KNOW IF THEY'RE WELL ENOUGH OR NOT -- BUT MY BASED ON A READMISSION RATES I WOULD GUESS THAT THEY'RE NOT. SO WHAT IS THE READMISSION RATES. FREEDOM OPULENT XIN. WE RUN OVERALL A READMISSION RATES OF ABOUT. 10% THERE'S THAT WE LOOK AT IT WITHIN THREE DAYS IN WITHIN THIRTY DAYS WITHIN THREE DAYS IT'S MUCH LOWER THAN THAT BUT WITHIN THIRTY DAYS IT IT'S IT'LL RUN ABOUT 10%. KAISER CONVERSELY WHICH IS -- YOU KNOW WE'LL HAVE IT DOES HAVE SOME MEDICARE ON IT THROUGH ITS MANAGE BUSINESS BUT ESSENTIALLY A NON MEDICARE BOOK OF BUSINESS THEIR READMISSION RATES HER. OVER THIRTY DAYS MAYBE ONE OR 2%. SO THOSE READ MISSIONS ARE PRETTY COSTLY. I WOULD SAY SO YES. AND THAT FROM DOING THE MATH HERE THAT'S ROUGHLY THIS POPULATION AMERICA PUBLISHES ROUGHLY. THAT THAT IS RELEASED TWO THIRDS THAT THEY CAN'T GET FOLLOW UP THAT'S LIKE 25%. OF ALL OF YOUR PEOPLE IN A YEAR. THAT ARE IT NEEDED A 90% OF WHICH ON A FIFTY ONE FIFTY SO THEY'RE THEY'RE PRETTY. EITHER EPISODICALLY ARE CHRONICALLY MEN IN A IN A CRISIS YES. THE STAGGERING ISN'T THE AND YOU'RE JUST ONE HOSPITAL. ONE HOSPITAL YES -- BOB OKAY -- DOCTOR SEWER -- ONE OF THE ISSUES WE'VE SEEN IN IN NEARLY ALL THE COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH PLANS -- IS THAT THEY'RE HAVING DIFFICULTY WITH NETWORK ADVOCACY -- FOR ADULT AND CHILD PSYCHIATRY -- DO YOU HAVE THOUGHTS ON THIS THERE'S SEVERAL STAGES TO THE PROBLEM -- ONE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT WE SIMPLY WON'T HAPPEN OF PSYCHIATRISTS. OF I THINK THERE'S BEEN A COUPLE OF REPORTS THAT COME OUT OF THE LAST COUPLE MONTHS THAT HAVE PROJECTED EVEN IF WE GRADUATED. YOU KNOW ALL THE PSYCHIATRY RESIDENCY SAID AT MAXIMUM CAPACITY WE WOULDN'T HAVE ENOUGH PSYCHIATRIST -- AND SO THAT'S WHAT'S LED TO INITIATIVES LIKE THAT THE T. AND T. PRIMARY CARE PSYCHIATRY PROGRAM -- TO TRY TO TRAIN PEOPLE WHO. ARE DOING. MENTAL HEALTH WERE THE PRIMARY CARE SETTING -- SO THAT'S ONE INITIATIVE THAT WE'VE DONE -- AND THEN TRYING TO ATTRACT THE PEOPLE THAT WE DO HAVE THAT ARE TRAINED AS PSYCHIATRISTS INSTALLED IN ADOLESCENT OR ADULT PSYCHIATRIST. TO STAY IN THE WORK FORCE -- BECAUSE UNFORTUNATELY WE HAVE A LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO OPT OUT OF MEDI CAL. AN OPT OUT OF MEDICARE -- SO WE TRADING COURAGE OUR MEMBERS TO PARTICIPATE BUT THAT'S DIFFICULT ONE PAYMENT STRUCTURES ARE SO CUMBERSOME. WE HEARD YESTERDAY IN OUR BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE -- THAT THE DEPARTMENT STATE HOSPITALS. SO ARGUABLY THAT'S OF SOME PRETTY PRETTY ILL PEOPLE IN THAT THE STATE HOSPITALS -- THE PSYCHIATRY -- VACANCY RATE FOR PSYCHIATRISTS IS FORTY POINT 6% [inaudible] AND SO. WE'RE DEALING YOU'RE DEALING WITH A VARIETY OF PEOPLE HERE I THINK THIS -- THIS IS BEYOND A CRISIS I THINK IT'S A IT'S IT'S PRETTY A PRETTY OVERWHELMING YEAH AND AND THERE WERE YOU KNOW WORKFORCE -- REPORTS THAT ARE SUGGESTING WE NEED TO INCREASE CAPACITY IN PSYCHIATRY RESIDENCIES -- FAST TRACKING MEDICAL STUDENTS INTO PSYCHIATRY VARIOUS INITIATIVES BUT IT'S STILL IT'S A PIPELINE ISSUE THAT REST BE SOLVED VERY GRADUALLY RIGHT. AND SO I THINK YOU THINK YOU AND AND AND SING WHEN I KNOW THAT YOU SOME OF THE ISSUES YOU BROUGHT UP I THINK THERE'S A BILL FLOATING AROUND OUT THERE WITH HER TO ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE SO I I THINK THANK YOU FOR THAT. SO. OF ANY QUESTIONS OR CONTENT SURE. I THANK YOU -- SO FIRST OF ALL I THINK -- FOR MISS A SINGLE MINUTE THE TERM -- THIS IS A TIME YOU'RE NOT. SENDING SOMEONE TO AN MRI OR DOING TESTS -- CERTAINLY AT THE FOUNDATION OF ALL. MEDICAL HEALTH CARE IS COMMUNICATION THAT PARTICULAR AROUND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SO. HE SPEAK TO THE ISSUE ABOUT LANGUAGE ACCESS AND MEDICO -- MENTAL HEALTH -- THE THE THE DIFFICULT EITHER EASE OR DIFFICULTY PATIENTS ARE HAVING BECAUSE I AM NOT SURE WHAT A MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONAL DOES. IF THEY CAN'T SPEAK THE LANGUAGE OF THE PATIENT AND PATIENTS UNDERSTAND SPEAK THE LANGUAGE OF THE PERSON SEEN THEM. YEAH THANK YOU THAT'S A REALLY GOOD QUESTION SO I THINK THAT THERE'S A COUPLE PIECES TO IT WHERE IT'S DIFFICULT SO ONE IS -- THROUGH THE PHONE CENTERS IN THE FIRST PLACE TO THE ACCESS LINES I THINK WE'VE SEEN SOME PROBLEMS WITH MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE INTERPRETERS WERE AVAILABLE ON THOSE LINES EVEN TELL PEOPLE HERE'S WHERE YOU CAN GO TO GET YOUR SERVICES SO THAT WOULD BE THE FIRST THING. I THINK THE SECOND PIECE IS THE ASSESSMENT PIECE THAT I TALKED ABOUT EVEN EVEN WHEN WE'RE DOING TRANSLATED ASSESSMENTS THEY'RE NOT ACCURATELY TRANSLATING AND SO. SOMETIMES PEOPLE WILL REFER TO HOW THEY KIND OF HIT THE BAR FOR PEOPLE TO QUALIFY FOR SERVICES SO THERE'S THAT LANGUAGE ACCESS PROBLEM THAT I THINK. NEEDS A LOT MORE STUDY IN A LOT MORE WORK AND THEN LIKE YOU BRING UP THERE'S ONCE YOU IF IF AND WHEN YOU ACTUALLY GET INTO TREATMENT -- THERE ISN'T THAT INTRACTABLE AT THE CLINICIAN AND YOU KNOW I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT THAT THAT DIFFERENT SYSTEMS I MEAN WE DO FOR A LOT OF AS YOU VERY WHERE FOR A LOT OF DIFFERENT MEDICAL THINGS YOU KNOW WE USED INTERPRETER LINE THOSE KINDS OF THINGS THAT THEY'RE NOT AS EFFECTIVE. IN MENTAL HEALTH AND SO THAT WE REALLY WHEN WE LOOK AT WORK FORCE I THINK NEED TO HAVE A PARTICULAR FOCUS IN MENTAL HEALTH AND BILINGUAL PROFESSIONALS -- AND IT'S IT'S ACTUALLY WHEN I WAS AT UC DAVIS -- MEMBER BUT WE PILOTED TO ACTUALLY TELL A PRETTY BECAUSE THE I MEAN IT'S NOT JUST THE LANGUAGE -- YOU MIGHT CATCH THE TONE OF VOICE OVER A PHONE LINE WHAT YOU DON'T SEE THE BODY LANGUAGE FACIAL EXPRESSIONS. THAT GIVE NEW WANTS TO WHAT THEY'RE SAYING AND REASON -- WE DON'T RECALL AN INTERPRETERS NOT TRANSLATORS IT'S NOT THE LITERAL TRANSLATION WE NEED WE NEED INTERPRETATION OF WHAT IS THE PATIENT TRYING TO COMMUNICATE. NOT NOT SAY A WORD BY WORD THING -- AND SO -- TO BE EFFECTIVE -- I THINK WE NEED TO LOOK ALSO BEYOND JUST PHONE. PHONE LINES AS A WAY TO COMMUNICATE WITH PEOPLE -- A DOCTOR SO -- YOUR YEAH I WAS THE RESIDENCY DIRECTOR AT UC DAVIS YOU'RE NOT RESIDENCY DIRECTOR -- SO YOU SEE THE TRAINEES -- WE TALK ABOUT WORK FORCE -- SO WHEN A TRAINEE GRADUATES AND THEY CHOOSE WHAT PATH THEY WANT TO TAKE TO PRACTICE AND THEY LOOK AT I GUESS WORKING FOR COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH. WELL WHAT DID THEY SEE I MEAN COMPARED TO WHAT THE OTHER OPTIONS ARE SO WE TALK ABOUT THE PIPELINE BUT I KNOW I SEE THAT IN THE GRADUATE THE START TALKING ABOUT THE CAREER CHOICES AND WHAT'S AVAILABLE TO THEM SO -- AND SO I'D BE CURIOUS TO IS -- TO THAT PART BECAUSE WE CAN STUFF MORE PEOPLE IN THE PIPELINE ABOUT SAYING THAT WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH BUT IF PEOPLE ARE HAVE OTHER OPTIONS AND WE CAN'T BE COMPETITIVE -- THAT'S AN ISSUE AND THEN I THINK THE OTHER THING IS IS THAT ONE COULD ARGUE THAT GIVEN THEM OUT OF OVERHEAD WORK. WE COULD PERHAPS INCREASE OUR WORKFORCE INSTANTLY BY 20% OR OF OVERHEAD BY HALF. I MEAN SERIOUSLY RIGHT VERSUS A LITERALLY -- FOR HIS MEDICAL SCHOOL FOUR YEARS OF PSYCHIATRIC TRAINING. TO GIVE FOUR CERTIFIED EIGHT YOUR PIPELINE. SO CAN YOU COMMENT ON THAT. YEAH WELL -- I'M SURE YOU'RE WHERE YOU SEE DAVIS HAS. EIGHTY THE THEY CALL ACE PC THAT'S A XCELERATED PIPELINE OUR MEDICAL STUDENTS TO COMPLETE MEDICAL SCHOOL IN THREE YEARS AND THE ACCEPTED INTO A PRIMARY CARE RESIDENCY PROGRAM SO. SUCH AS FAMILY MEDICINE PEDIATRIC AND STARTED SO -- AT UC DAVIS SECONDS AS SPEAK FROM MY OWN PERSONAL PERSPECTIVE -- WERE INVESTIGATING WHETHER OR NOT WE COULD INCORPORATE PSYCHIATRY INTO THAT AND SPECIFICALLY INTERNAL MEDICINE PSYCHIATRY IN FAMILY MEDICINE PSYCHIATRY -- YEAH WORDY TAKING -- THE WITH THE COMBINED PROGRAMS WE TAKE SEVEN YEARS OF TRAINING THE THE PRIMARY CARE SPECIALTIES THREE YEARS PSYCHIATRY BEING FOUR YEARS WITH THE PRESIDENT OF FIVE TO PRODUCE DAHLE BOARD CERTIFIED PEOPLE SO THAT AGAIN. WE CAN TRAIN PROVIDE THAT ONE STOP SHOP A LITTLE THEY GO TAKE YOUR MEDI CAL PATIENTS ARE TO GO HAVE OTHER OPTIONS THE MAJORITY OF OUR GRADUATES FROM UC DAVIS DO YOU ACTUALLY GO INTO THE PUBLIC OKAY -- SECTOR SO WE WE TEND TO ATTRACT TO YOU WE HAD OVER A HUNDRED APPLICATIONS FOR G. SPOTS THIS PAST YEAR AND KILLING MEDICINE PSYCHIATRY. AND THE VAST VAST MAJORITY OF MEDICAL STUDENTS THAT I INTERVIEW SAY HOW THEY WANT TO WORK IN UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES RETURN BACK TO RURAL COMMUNITIES IT'S IT'S ACTUALLY VERY ENCOURAGING AND IT SEEMS LIKE -- PART OF THE DRAW FOR DOING COMBINED IN PARTICULAR IS TO WORK IN UNDERSERVED AREAS WITH UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS. OKAY THANK YOU AND I JUST WANTED KNOWLEDGE -- MISTER DAR UM I WANT THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. THANK YOU -- THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO ALL OF YOU AND WE MAY HAVE FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS I HOPE WE CAN ENGAGE WITH YOU FURTHER ON THESE ISSUES SO. WE LIKE TO GO AHEAD AND MOVE INTO PUBLIC COMMENT -- AND TO SEE STATE YOUR NAME AND ORGANIZATION AND WE COULD KEEP IT MAY BE A COUPLE MINUTES. I THANK YOU.
