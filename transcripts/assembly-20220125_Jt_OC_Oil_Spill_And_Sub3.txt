OP WE ARE HERE TODAY- BECAUSE ON THE EVENING OF OCTOBER FIRST A BROKEN PIPELINE ON AND OFF SHORE PLATFORMS IN FEDERAL WATERS OFF THE COAST OF HUNTINGTON BEACH BEGAN TO SPEW THOUSANDS OF GALLONS. OF POST PRODUCTION OF CRUDE OIL INTO THE BEAUTIFUL COASTAL WATERS OF ORANGE COUNTY AND SAN DIEGO. A UNIFIED COMMAND TEAM WAS SIMPLY SWIFTLY MOBILIZED TO IMPLEMENT EMERGENCY RESPONSE AND CLEANUP AND ON DECEMBER TWENTY EIGHTH TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE UNIFIED COMMAND DID ANNOUNCE THAT THE CLEAN UP EFFORT HAD CONCLUDED. THE PIPELINE IS SECURE THE OIL HAS BEEN REMOVED FROM THE PIPELINE IT HAS BEEN FLUSH WITH WATER AND TESTED. AND INVESTIGATION INTO THE INCIDENT HAS REALLY ONLY JUST BEGUN AND THE FULL INVESTIGATION IS EXPECTED TO TAKE UP TO SEVERAL WEEKS YEARS AND AT COULD RESULT IN BOTH CIVIL AS WELL AS CRIMINAL. LIABILITIES WE CONDUCTED A HEARING ON AT THE END OF LAST YEAR OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE. AT LOOKING INTO OPPORTUNITIES FOR US TO IMPROVE OUR OIL SPILL PREVENTION AND RESPONSE STRATEGIES AS THE STATE I. THE CLEARLY BOTH NOT IT FROM THIS IS THAT FROM THE DISASTER THAT RESULTED IN THE CREATION OF OUR SELECT COMMITTEE IS REALLY CLEAR WHEN WE DRILL WE SPELL AND THE GOAL OF TODAY'S HEARING. IS TO BUILD OUR KNOWLEDGE AND OUR UNDERSTANDING AT FOR ALL OF THE FACTORS THAT WE NEED TO CONSIDER AS WE LOK TO DECOMMISSION OFFSHORE OIL. INFRASTRUCTURE OFF THE COAST OF CALIFORNIA TODAY WILL BE I DIGGING INTO A NUMBER OF. FIVE HAVE. A CONVERSATIONS FOCUSED AROUND COST ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS WORKFORCE TRANSITION LIABILITY CONSIDERATIONS I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO THE OPPORTUNITY. REALLY TO LEARN FROM OUR PANELISTS HERE TODAY AND- TO CONTINUE ON A PATH TO DEVELOP AN EXPEDITED PHASE OUT PLAN FOR DECOMMISSIONING. OFF BEFORE WE MOVE TO OUR FIRST PANEL I'D LIKE TO ASK IF ANY OF OUR OTHER SUBCOMMITTEE MEMBERS WOULD LIKE TO MAKE AN OPENING STATEMENT. ASSEMBLY MEMBER PLEASE. WELL GOOD MORNING. AND THANK YOU FOR. PULLING THIS HEARING TOGETHER ALONG WITH A CHAIR THREE OF US- THERE'S A LOT OF WORK THAT GOES INTO GETTING THESE HEARINGS TOGETHER AND- AND I KNOW WE ALL WANT TO THANK- ARSED STAFFS AND THE SELECT COMMITTEE STAFF FOR. PUTTING HEARING TOGETHER THANK YOU AGAINST YOUR COLLEAGUE PETRIE-NORRIS. AS CHAIR OF BUDGET SUB THREE AND WE HAVE- THREE DIFFERENT COMMITTEES THAT ARE REPRESENTED HERE- AT TODAY AT THE AT THE- SELECT COMMITTEE. THE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE ON NATURAL RESOURCES AND UP MY BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE ON CLIMATE CRISIS RESOURCES ENERGY AND TRANSPORTATION AND IN MY CAPACITY I'M- REALLY ALL TOO FAMILIAR WITH THE SUBSTANTIAL COSTS THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH DECOMMISSIONING JUST LAST YEAR WE INCREASED THE FUNDING TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE. STAFF TO PREVENT OIL SPILLS BUT WE ALSO SPENT FIFTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS TO PLUG AND ABANDON AN OFFSHORE WELL IN SANTA BARBARA. WITH THE TOTAL STATE COSTS NOW APPROACHIG SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS WHICH DOESN'T EVEN COVER THE ENTIRE COST OF. DECOMMISSIONING THIS ONE PLATFORM. AS WE EXPLORE STRATEGIES FOR DECOMMISSIONING. I'M VERY CONCERNED TO AND HOPE TO LEARN MORE ABOUT HOW WE ENSURE THAT EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE IS PROPERLY MAINTAINED. AND WHAT MEASURES ARE IN PLACE TO ENSURE SAFE OPERATION WITH AGING WHILE INFRASTRUCTURE WE MUST ENSURE. THAT THE RESPONSIBLE PARTIES PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE TO PROTECT OUR COAST AND INLAND AREAS FROM OIL DESTRUCTION. I WHEN I COULD I BECAME- TH EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF A NONPROFIT LOS ANGELES AND NUMBER YEARS AGO AND IT WAS IN DOWNTOWN LA AND- THE LOT NEXT DOOR HAD A STRANGE LOOKING CAP- VALVE SYSTEM ON IT IT TURNED OUT THAT- THIS WAS A VESTIGE OF AN OIL WELL THAT WENT BACK ALMOST TO THE FOUNDING OF LOS ANGELES BECAUSE OIL HAS BEEN- IN LA- OIL WAS KING FOR A ARE FOR QUITE A TIME AND THERE REALLY WEREN'T ANY RULES AT ALL AROUND DECOMMISSIONING OIL WELLS AT THAT TIME. THE WELLS WERE SHALLOW AND I LEARNED THAT- PEOPLE ACTUALLY WHEN THE WILL WAS DEPLETED JUST STARTED THROWING GARBAGE IN THE PIT THAT WAS LEFT FROM FROM THE WELL- WE'VE OBVIOUSLY COME A LONG WAY FROM THAT TIME- BUT WE'RE NOT WHO ARE CLEARLY HOT ALL THE WAY THERE YEAH AND- ALSO THERE'S A LOT OF WORK TO BE DONE HERE. OUR PREVIOUS HEARING WAS VERY INFORMATIVE AND I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING FROM ALL OF OUR PANELISTS IN ABOUT TO. ABOUT THE HISTORY AND FUTURE OF OFFSHORE DRILLING IN OUR STATE. AND STRATEGIES FOR DECOMMISSIONING AND TRANSITIONING AS WE- CONTINUE TO TRANSITION AWAY FROM OUR DEPENDENCE ON FOSSIL FUEL AS WE MUST. WE NEED TO DEVELOP POLICY SOLUTIONS THAT ADDRESS THE NEAR TERM IMPACTS OF CONTINUED PRODUCTION. ALONG AND THE LONG TERM CONSIDERATIONS FOR RESPONSIBLE RESPONSIBLY DECOMMISSIONING PLATFORMS AND WELLS AND MAKING SURE THAT THERE'S AN EQUITABLE TRANSITION FOR THOSE WHO WORK IN THIS INDUSTRY- TO MOVE INTO. OTHER- WELL PAYING POSITIONS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER BLOOM AT ASSEMBLY MEMBER RIVAS. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER PETRIE-NORRIS FOR CONVENING THIS HEARING TODAY I'M GLAD TO SEE THAT THE CLEAN UP AND RECOVERY FROM THE ORANGE COUNTY SPELL IS PROCEEDING WELL AND THE SITUATION LOOKS A LOT BETTER THAN IT DID WHEN WE MET IN YOUR DISTRICT LAST NOVEMBER. I THINK IF THERE'S ANY SILVER LINING TO A SPELL IT'S THAT IT SHARPENS OUR FOCUS ON THE RISKS OF PETROLEUM DEPENDENCE AND DEMANDS THAT WE CONSIDER HOW WE WILL TRANSITION AWAY FROM FOSSIL FUELS TOWARD A SAFER AND MORE SUSTAINABLE ENERGY FUTURE. THIS HEARING WILL FOCUS ON ONE IMPORTANT ASPECT OF THAT TRANSITION HOW BEST TO MANAGE A DECLINING RESOURCE AN AGING INFRASTRUCTURE WHICH IS ALSO A SIGNIFICANT SOURCE OF JOBS AND REVENUE THAT MUST BE PLAYED. THIS IS NOT A PROBLEM THAT WILL SOLVE ITSELF AND THE CLOCK IS TICKING BOTH ON THE CLIMATE IMPACTS AND WHEN THE NEXT ACCIDENT MAY OCCUR. COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA ARE AT RISK DUE TO THE INHERENT RISKS OF OIL PRODUCTION AND DELIVERY COMBINED WITH AN AGING INFRASTRUCTURE. OUTDATED POLLUTION CONTROLS. AND INADEQUATE MAINTENANCE AS I SAID IN NOVEMBER THESE RISKS PALE IN COMPARISON TO THE DAILY HEALTH IMPACTS OF PETROLEUM PRODUCTION REFINING AND USE. EVEN IF ACCIDENTS ARE ELIMINATING USING OIL AS INTENDED KILLS PEOPLE ON THE PLANET. AND LOW INCOME AND MINORITY COMMUNITIES SUFFER THE MOST I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS HEARING TODAY. WHAT WE SHOULD CONSIDER AND WHAT ACTIONS THE STATE MAY NEED TO TAKE TO FACILITATE DECOMMISSIONING AS PART OF THE TRANSITION TO A SUSTAINABLE ENERGY FUTURE THANK YOU. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER GIPSON THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS FIRST I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR ONE CONVENE THIS PATTERN BECAUSE I THINK IT'S A CONVERSATION THAT ABSOLUTELY- NESS IS NECESSARY TO HAVE NOT ONLY FOR OUR OWN OUT OF EDUCATION BUT ALSO FOR THE RESIDENTS THAT HAVE BEEN IMPACTED BY THIS OIL SPILL I REPRESENT AN HONOR TO REPRESENT THE SIXTY FOUR STATE ASSEMBLY DISTRICT- MY DISTRICT IS HOME TO FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES OF COMPTON CARSON WOMAN TO KNOW LONG BEACH. LITTLE GUARDINO AND ALSO TOWARDS. IN OCTOBER IN THE LOS ANGELES TIMES REPORTED THAT A PIPELINE LEAK ABOUT- A HUNDRED AND FORTY FOUR THOUSAND GALLONS. I'M INTO THE COASTAL WATERS WHICH CAUSED A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT TO THE BEACH INTO THE WETLANDS INTO THE ENVIRONMENT. BECAUSE OF THAT PARTICULARLY SINCE THE OIL SPILL MY STAFF HAVE- BEEN ON WEEKLY CONFERENCE CALLS MONITORING THE SITUATION ANSWERING CALLS BECAUSE CERTAINLY- IN ORANGE WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE AREA WHERE IT AFFECTED ITS RAVEL EVEN TO THE AREAS IN WHICH I REPRESENTS- AGAIN. I REPRESENT PAR SUPPORTERS OF LONG BEACH AND ALSO THE PORT OF LOS ANGELES AND SO WE'RE IN WE WERE IMPACTED BY BY THIS AS WELL AS AN ASSEMBLY MEMBER. WHO COMES FROM ORGANIZED LABOR THE LABOR BACKGROUND I AM HIGHLY INTERESTED TO HEAR FROM THE STATE BUILDING SINCE RATES ON THE WHAT DOES THE DECOMMISSIONED MEANS TO THE WORKERS- IN THAT PARTICULAR AREA. I AM ALSO INTERESTED IN HEARING FROM THE ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE CENTERS AND OTHERS ON STRATEGIES AND HOW DO WE MOVE CALIFORNIA FORWARD IN ADDRESSING THIS ISSUE MAKING SURE THAT THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN- IN THE NEAR NEAR FUTURE I'M SPECIFICALLY. INTERESTED INTO HEARING. IF THERE IS AY LEGISLATION- LEGISLATION OR BUDGET RECOMMENDATIONS THAT COMES FROM TODAY'S DISCUSSIONWILL BE MEANINGFUL AS WE MOVE FORWARD LASTLY. I WOULD LIKE TO AGAIN THANK MY COLLEAGUES- FOR YOUR DEDICATION AND ADDRESSING THIS ISSUE IS ONE THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED IT'SONE THAT I BELIEVE THAT OUR RESIDENTS. IN THE AFFECTED AREA AND OUTSIDE THE AFFECTED AREAS ABSOLUTELY DESERVE TO HAVE IN THIS OPEN FORUM I LOOK FORWARD TO THE CONVERSATION TO THE PEOPLE DOING THE PUBLIC COMMENTS TO WEIGHING IN. ON THEIR CONCERNS BUT MOST OF ALL LOOKING AT HOW- SOLUTIONS CAN BE DERIVED AT THE SITUATION MOVING FORWARD THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER BOERNER HORVATH. THANK YOU- TO THE CHAIRS FOR CONVENING TODAY'S HEARING- I REPRESENT COASTAL SAN DIEGO COUNTY AND SO WHEN WE HAVE THE ORANGE COUNTY OIL SPILL. MY DISTRICT IS THE FIRST AFFECTED IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY BY ED. AND HEARINGS LIKE THIS ARE ESSENTIAL- IF WE EVER WANT TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THE ONLY SOLUTION THAT WILL PREVENT OIL SPILLS LIKE THIS FROM HAPPENING AGAIN WHICH IS DE COMMISSIONING. WE NEED TO PLAN CAREFULLY- NOT ONLY SO WE CAN SAFELY TACKLE- THE ENVIRONMENTAL AND ENGINEERING CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH PERMANENTLY SHUTTING DOWN AND CLEANING UP THESE OPERATIONS IN OUR COASTAL WATERS. BUT ALSO TO TRANSITION THE WORK FORCE IN A WAY THAT LEAVES THEM WITH A VIABLE JOBS AND CAREERS TO REPLACE THE ONES BEING LOST. I'M LOOKING FOR TO THE TESTIMONY TODAY AND LEARNING HOW WE CAN WORK COLLABORATIVELY TO CONTINUE ADVANCING POLICIES. THAT PROTECT OUR STATE'S PRECIOUS NATURAL RESOURCES LIKE ACOSTA TOP. INSURANCE PARTNER FEATURE THAT INCLUDES THE SKILLED WORKFORCE THAT MEETS. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER RODRIGUEZ. THANK YOU CHURN UP BETWEEN ARSON MEMBERS FOR JOINING US HERE THIS MORNING ALWAYS ON A VERY IMPORTANT TOPIC AS CHAIR OF THE MARCH MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE. ONE OF MY PRIORITIES IS TO HELP BETTER PREPARE CALIFORNIA FOR DISASTERS AND PREVENT THEM IN THE FIRST PLACE WE ALL THE CASE. AS IT DOES PRONE STATE FROM FIRES FLOODS EARTHQUAKES IN THE OIL SPILLS. AS WE LOOK TO. DECOMMISSION SOME OF THESE PROBLEMATIC UP OIL RIGS MY FIRST. ISSUE I WANT TO TALK ABOUT HOW WE BETTER PREPARED THAT AS WE'RE LOOKING TO. REMOVE SOME OF THESE ARE OR WERE EXTENT ARE WE IN A GOOD PLACE TO RESPOND IN CASE ANY OTHER. SPILLS COME FROM THAT ARE WE BETTER PREPARE LESSONS LEARNED. FROM WHAT HAPPENED HERE A FEW MONTHS AGO THERE IN ORANGE COUNTY. AND TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL OUR FIRST RESPONDERS OUT THERE THAT RESPOND TO THESE TYPES OF. DISASTERS ARE HAVE WHAT THEY NEED TO DO THEIR JOB TO GET THIS- THE BILLS. CARE OF AND STOPPED ENTIRELY SO WITHOUT- I WANT TO THANK EVERYBODY FOR BEING HERE. AND LOOK FOR TO THIS HEARING ON DISCUSSIONS ON HOW WE CAN ALL SHARE OUR SHARED GOALS THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER DAVIES. THANK VENTURE FOR HOLDING THIS HEARING AND I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUES FOR ALL OF THE COMMENTS AS WELL AS A SPEAKER SPEAKING TODAY I JUST I KNOW THAT WE'RE ALL HERE TO COME UP WITH COMMONSENSE SOLUTIONS AND SERVICES HEARING DEALS WITH POTENTIAL DECOMMISSIONING OFFSHORE OIL I WANT TO START OFF WITH A SIMPLE YET OVERLOOKED POINT EVERY COOPER WE DO NOT PRODUCE HERE IN CALIFORNIA MEANS THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO IMPORT FROM COUNTRIES SUCH AS CHINA AND SAUDI ARABIA. THESE ARE COUNTRIES THAT DO NOT HAVE AB THREE TWO. REGULATIONS DO NOT HAVE ARE YOUR STANDARDS AND DO NOT HAVE OR OCEAN WATER QUALITY STANDARDS. IN A TWIST OF IRONY AND OFFSHORE OIL BAND ACTUALLY ENDANGERS OUR ENVIRONMENTAL EVEN MORE. WITH INCREASED NEEDS FOR OVERSEAS OIL AS A RESULT OF A BAND WE WILL SEE INCREASED TANKERS AND CARGO SHIPS COMING INTO OUR WATERS AND WE'VE SEEN OF WHAT HOW THAT HAS HAPPEN. JUST FOR CONTENT ONE OF THESE VESSELS CAN CARRY ONE MILLION GALLONS OF OIL IMAGINE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF WAITED TANKER ACCIDENT FOR SHORTS. IT WOULD TAKE DECADES TO RECOVER FROM CATASTROPHIC LIKE THIS. LASTLY I LEAVE MY OPINION REMARKS REMAINING COMMITTEE MEMBERS THAT ACCORDING TO MULTIPLY MULTIPLE AIR TOXIC EXPOSURE STUDIES FROM THE S. C. A. Q. M. DEEP THE AIR TOXIC CANCER RISK IS HIGHER THAN NINETY NINE PERCENT. OF THE POPULATION FOR COMMUNITIES LIVING NEAR PORTS AND DIESEL PARTICLE MATTER IS MADE UP OF SIXTY SEVEN POINT 4% OF THE POLLUTANTS CONTRIBUTE TO A CANCER RISK SO AS WE SIT HERE TODAY LISTENING TO POTENTIAL DECOMMISSIONING OF OFFSHORE OIL I AM AS THAT WEAKNESS THAT THIS POLICY MAY BE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES AND RAMIFICATIONS. AGAIN I JUST I'M I'M TO THIS I THINK THAT WE'VE ALL GOT- GOOD IDEAS I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT WHATEVER WE DO WON'T HAVE RAMIFICATIONS- THAT WILL LAST LONGER THAN WITH NO OIL SPILL COULD THANK YOU. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER WHEN. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR OF FIRST I WANT TO THANK YOU AND THE STAFF FOR HOSTING THE OUR SECOND MEETING- AS MOST OF YOU KNOW MY DISTRICT WAS THE ONE THAT GOT DIRECTLY IMPACTED. WITH THE OIL SPILL AND OUR BEACHES WAS SHUT DOWN. AND MY GOAL HAS ALWAYS BEEN IS TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH MY COLLEAGUES TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS TYPE OF VET WOULD NOT HAPPEN AGAIN I KNOW COSTA LINE. AS YOU KNOW I WAS ON THE SCENE DO AERIAL TOURS LAND TOURS BEACH TORE. MEETING WITH STAFF COMMAND CENTER WEEKLY MEETINGS MYSELF AND ALL MY STAFF- YOU NAME IT THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN AND NOT JUST WHAT THE DISCUSSION IS TODAY. WE HAD ISSUES WITH THE COMMAND CENTER BEEN AND I'D TELL YOU THAT'S NOT EVEN NEAR ORANGE COUNTY. THAT IF YOU WERE TO TAKE YOU KNOW IF YOU WERE FROM ASSEMBLY MEMBER DAVIES OFFICE GOING ALL THE WAY TO THE COMMAND CENTER IT COULD EASILY TAKE AN HOUR TO AN HOUR AND A HALF- WE NEED TO ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES WE NEED COMMAND CENTERS. IN AREAS THAT ARE MOST IMPACTED NOT SO FAR AWAY. WE NEED. TO TALK ABOUT NOTIFICATION. WHEN THEY WORK WHY WOULD THEY DELAY. ALL THESE WERE DISCUSS. AND I HOPE THAT WE CONTINUE THESE DISCUSSIONS. SO THAT WE AS WE MOVE FORWARD WE DON'T JUST. PINPOINT ONE ISSUE IS THAT THIS HAS TO BE AN OVERALL. WE NEED TO ALSO HELP AND ENCOURAGE CITIES ON THE COAST LINE. TO HAVE A MASTER PLAN. AND IN A COORDINATED MASTER PLAN. THAT WORKS TOGETHER ANY COORDINATION WITH EACH OTHER SINCE THEIR NEXT DOOR TO EACH OTHER. BECAUSE WHAT WE FOUND. DURING THIS. IT DURING THIS TIME WAS THAT. SOME CITIES HADN'T AT THE CITY'S DIDN'T SOME SET CITY WHERE EXTREMELY COMPREHENSIVE. OTHERS WOULD JUST. OKAY SO I THINK THAT YOU KNOW. AS A STATE AID AS A STATE WE SHOULD LOOK AT AND HELP THE CITY'S- TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ALL ON THE SAME PAGE HAVE SAME. MASTER PLAN OR SIMILAR MASTER PLAN. THAT THE COORDINATION WOULD BE VERY VERY SMOOTH. SO AND AS WE CONTINUE ON OUR MEETINGS. I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HEAR FROM THE PUBLIC. AND ALL STAKEHOLDERS EVERYONE OF AFFECTED BY IT. BECAUSE I WOULD TELL YOU INTERESTING FACT THAT OUR- LOCAL ECONOMY. WHEN THIS HAPPENED WE HAD OUR LARGEST AIR SHOW PACIFIC AIR SHOW THAT WAS SHUT DOWN A DAY EARLY. AND WE'RE THAT WE CAN WAS EXPECTED BE OVER A MILLION PEOPLE. AND THEY WERE SHUT DOWN ESPECIALLY OUR RESTAURANTS BIETEN SO MUCH FOOD THAT ENDED UP BEING THROWN OUT BECAUSE THERE WAS NOBODY LEFT ON THE BEACH- BECAUSE THEY WERE ANTICIPATED OVER MILLION PEOPLE VISITING THE AREA. SO THESE ARE THINGS THAT WE HAVE TO LOOK AT SO IT'S NOT JUST YOU KNOW THE INDUSTRY ITSELF WE NEED LOOK AT THE EMPLOYEES WE NEED THE LOOK AT THEM- THE LOCAL ECONOMY THE BUSINESSES WITHIN THE AREA AS WELL AND HOW IT'S AFFECTED AND OF COURSE THE NEIGHBORHOODS. AND LIKE IT'S NOT ONLY IT'S JUST NOT ONLY BUSINESS THAT'S RIGHT NEXT TO THE BEACH. THIS IS WITH IN THAT CITY OR NEXT DOOR TO THAT CITY BECAUSE THEY DO BENEFIT FROM THE TOURISM. THAT COMES INTO THAT AREA IS SO IT'S JUST NOT ONLY THE SEAS. ALONG THE COASTS IT'S ALSO CITIES NEXT DOOR TO THEM AS WELL. SO AGAIN THANK YOU MANAGER FOR- HOSTING THE SECOND MEETING AND I LOOK FORWARD TO THE CONVERSATION AND DISCUSSION. ASSEMBLY MEMBER BRAND. MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU FOR CONVENING THIS JOINT COMMITTEE THANK YOU TO THE OTHER JURORS HAVE JOINED US THIS MORNING THIS IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT ISSUE AND IT'S NOT JUST IN THE COASTLINE- IN MY DISTRICT I REPRESENT THE LARGEST URBAN OIL FIELD IN THE COUNTRY WE HAD A SIXTEEN HUNDRED GALLON OIL SPILL JUST LAST APRIL SO THINKING ABOUT HOW WE TRANSITION. OUT OF OUR FOSSIL FUEL INFRASTRUCTURE INTO A GREEN ECONOMY AND MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S A JUST TRANSITION FOR ALL OF THOSE WORKERS WHO DESERVE AT AT AN EQUAL WAGE WERE STRONGER WAGE IN JUST AS MANY JOBS AS CURRENTLY THAT CURRENTLY EXIST AND OUR FOSSIL FUEL INDUSTRY. IS IMPORTANT BUT IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT HERE FROM ALL OF THE STAKE HOLDERS WHO ARE IMPACTED AS WAS MENTIONED EARLIER THE BUSINESSES LOCAL RESIDENTS- WORKERS. AND REMEMBER THAT A LOT OF YOUNG FOLKS OF LOWER LIFE EXPECTANCIES BECAUSE THEY HAVE POOR AIR QUALITY POOR WATER QUALITY AND OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS THAT THEY LIVE CLOSE TO SO. THANK YOU FOR CONVENING THIS PANEL OF EXPERTS TODAY I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO LEARNING AND THINKING AND I'M HAPPY TO PARTICIPATE IN ANY LEGISLATIVE SOLUTIONS WITH THIS BODY COMES UP WITH. FOR THE SAKE. THANK YOU I WITH THAT WE WILL GO AHEAD AND JUMP INTO OUR FIRST PANEL. MY APOLOGIES ASSEMBLY MEMBER IT ON HOLD AND I'LL BE QUICK BECAUSE A LOT OF INSIDE A LISTEN I REPRESENT A DISTRICT- YEAH I MY DISTRICT IS HAS THE PORT OF LONG BEACH AND THE PORT OF LOS ANGELES I AM THE REPRESENTATIVE FOR THOSE. THOSE TWO PORTS IS A LOT OF OIL MOVEMENT THERE A LOT OF OIL PRODUCTION THERE SO I'M VERY INTERESTED IN THE CONVERSATION TODAY TO ME THE SOLUTION PROBABLY LIES. IN SOME% TYPE OF STATEWIDE RESERVE FUND BECAUSE REMEMBER THE STATE IS A PARTNER IN MANY THESE OPERATIONS THE STATE MAKES MONEY OFFICE OR HOME THAT IS HOW WE PAY IN PART FOR OUR SCHOOLS AND OTHER FUNCTIONS OF THE STATE. SO THOSE ARE CONVERSATION TOPICS WE NEED TO INCLUDE AS WELL SO WITH THAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU I AND WITH THAT WE WILL GO AHEAD AND- WELCOME OUR FIRST PANELISTS AT JENNIFER LEE CASEY. FROM THE CALIFORNIA STATE LANDS COMMISSION- THE FIRST PANEL. WILL FOCUS ON THE HISTORY OF OFFSHORE DRILLING AND PLATFORM JUST DECOMMISSIONING. IN CALIFORNIA WATERS. THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER CASEY. THANK YOU RIGHT GOOD MORNING TEARS PETRIE-NORRIS THREE OF US IN BLOOM AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS JENNIFER LOOK HAS THE HIGH END THE EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE LANDS COMMISSION THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE DISCUSSION TODAY. THE STATE'S OFFSHORE OIL AND GAS LEASING HISTORY IS COMPLEX AND NUANCED. AND TO STATE THE OBVIOUS THE ENERGY POLICIES FROM THE NINETEEN FIFTIES AND THE NINETEEN SIXTIES ARE VERY DIFFERENT FROM CALIFORNIA'S VALUES AND PRINCIPLES. AND OUR POLICY PRIORITIES OF TODAY. HOWEVER THESE LEGACY DECADES OLD ENERGY POLICIES ARE WHAT CREATED THE LEGAL CONSTITUTIONAL AND CONTRACTUAL FRAMEWORK. THAT DICTATES THE COMPLEXITY OF THE OIL AND GAS LEASE MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK TO THIS DAY AND WILL NECESSARILY INFORM YOUR DISCUSSION AND DELIBERATION. ON HOW TO ADVANCE OUR SHARED ENERGY CLEAN ENERGY AND JUST TRANSITION OBJECTIVES. IT IS COMPLEX BUT NOT IMPOSSIBLE TO ADDRESS NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. FIRST AS BACKGROUND THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION MANAGES THE STATE SAW FROM PUBLIC TRUST LANDS WHICH INCLUDE APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED TWENTY RIVERS AND SLEW'S. FORTY LAKES AND LANDS ALONG THE OVER ELEVEN HUNDRED MILES. OF COASTLINE AND UNDERLINE THE PACIFIC OCEAN OUT THREE MILES TO THE STATE FEDERAL BOUNDARY. THE COMMISSION ALSO EXERCISES OVERSIGHT AUTHORITY OVER THE STATE'S PUBLIC LANDS GRANTED IN TRUST BY THE LEGISLATURE TO APPROXIMATELY. SEVENTY LOCAL JURISDICTIONS THAT THIS INCLUDES OFFSHORE LONG BEACH OIL OPERATIONS OPERATED AND MANAGED BY THE CITY OF LONG BEACH. WELL THE COMMISSION HAS SOME REGULATORY FUNCTIONS IT IS PRINCIPALLY A LAND AND RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AGENCY NOT A REGULATORY AGENCY. THE COMMISSION IS SIMILAR TO THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF OCEAN AND ENERGY MANAGEMENT OR BOEM. AND THE BUREAU OF SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL ENFORCEMENT BESSIE OFFSHORE AND THE BUREAU OF LAND MANAGEMENT ON SHORE. FOR THOSE OIL AND GAS OFFSHORE FACILITIES AND PIPELINES LOCATED EXCLUSIVELY IN STATE WATERS THE EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURES MANAGE PURSUANT TO A LEASE FROM THE COMMISSION OR LOCAL GOVERNMENT GRANT T. SPECIFICALLY PIPELINES THAT ARE LOCATED SOLELY WITHIN STATE BOUNDARIES INCLUDING STATE WATERS ARE CALLED INTRASTATE PIPELINES AND THEY ARE REGULATED BY THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL. FOR THOSE PIPELINES THAT CROSS STATE WATERS CONNECTING FEDERAL OFFSHORE PLATFORMS TO ON SHORE FACILITIES. THESE PIPELINES ARE CONSIDERED INTERSTATE PIPELINES AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THROUGH THE PIPELINE AND HAZARDOUS MAERIALS SAFETY ADMINISTRATION ARE FILMS THAT HAS PRIMARY REGULATORY AUTHORITY CAL GEM FILMS THAT AND BESSIE ALL COLLABORATIVELY WORK TOGETHER TO SHARE INSPECTION REPORTS AND ANALYSIS AND COMPLIANCE PURSUANT TO AN MLA. THE M. O. A. ASSURE IS A COORDINATED ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK FOR REGULATION IMPLEMENTATION AND COMPLIANCE. FOR OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION FACILITIES LIKE PLATFORMS ARE ISLAND IN FEDERAL WATERS THOSE ARE BY BASS. IN STATE WATERS ARE A MANAGE PURSE TO A FOR THE- OR TO GRANT- FROM THE LA. LIKE THE LONG BEACH OPERATIONS. I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF INTEREST IN WHAT IS GOING ON WITH FEDERAL OPERATIONS- I'M NOT AN EXPERT ON FEDERAL OPERATIONS BUT WHAT I CAN TELL YOU IS THAT THERE ARE TWENTY THREE PLATFORMS IN FEDERAL WATERS ALL BUILT BETWEEN NINETEEN SIXTY AND NINETEEN NINETIES. AND THIRTY EIGHT EXISTING FEDERAL LEASES ALL LOCATED BETWEEN THREE POINT SEVEN MILES AND TEN POINT FIVE MILES OFFSHORE IN WATER DEPTHS BETWEEN NINETY FIVE FEET. AND TWELVE HUNDRED FEET- THIRTEEN FEDERAL PLATFORMS OFFSHORE SANTA BARBARA COUNTY. FOR FEDERAL PLATFORMS OFFSHORE VENTURA COUNTY. AND FOR FEDERAL PLATFORMS OFFSHORE LOS ANGELES AND ORANGE COUNTY. EIGHT ARE NO LONGER PRODUCING THEY'RE ALL LOCATED IN THE SANTA BARBARA CHANNEL AND BESSIE WITH THE ASSISTANCE FROM BOMB ARE DEVELOPING A PROGRAMMATIC EIS TO INFORM FUTURE DECOMMISSIONING APPLICATIONS. THE DRAFT PROGRAMMATIC EIS IS ANTICIPATED BE RELEASED IN FEBRUARY WITH A FINAL RELEASED IN JUNE NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. SO TAKING A STEP BACK AND LOOKING SPECIFICALLY AT CALIFORNIA IN NINETEEN TWENTY ONE THE LEGISLATURE CREATED THE FIRST THAILAND'S OIL AND GAS LEASING PROGRAM. THE EXISTING OFFSHORE LEASES AND THE COMMISSION IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MANAGING WERE ISSUED OVER A THIRTY YEAR PERIOD BETWEEN NINETEEN THIRTY EIGHT AND NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT. AND NINETEEN FIFTY FIVE THE LEGISLATURE PASSED THE CUNNINGHAM SHALL ACT WHICH SERVES AS THE FOUNDATIONAL LAW FOR THE EXISTING OIL AND GAS LEASES THE COMMISSION CURRENTLY MANAGES. CERTAINLY THIS AFTER CARD THE COMMISSION TO ISSUE OIL AND GAS LEASES FOR A TERM NOT BASED ON YEARS. BUT FOR SO LONG AS OIL AND GAS IS PRODUCED IN PAYING QUANTITIES. ESSENTIALLY THIS MEANS THAT A LESSEE OR AN OPERATOR CAN PRODUCE OIL AND GAS PURSUANT TO THEIR STATELY INDEFINITELY. AS LONG AS IT IS ECONOMIC FOR THEM TO DO SO. THIS SPECIFIC TERM IS INCLUDED IN ALL THE REMAINING ELEVEN ACTIVELY PRODUCING OFFSHORE LEASES THE COMMISSION MANAGES. THESE LEASES WERE ENTERED INTO OVER FIFTY YEARS AGO AND PRIOR TO THE NINETEEN NINETY FOUR COASTAL SANCTUARY ACT. THROUGH THE COASTAL SANCTUARY ACT THE LEGISLATURE PLACE THE ENTIRETY OF CALIFORNIA'S COAST OFF LIMITS TO NEW OIL AND GAS LEASES. AS YOU PREVIOUSLY HEARD LUMBERKINGS EASTERN OIL SPILL PREVENTION AND RESPONSE ACTORS PASSED IN NINETEEN NINETY ONE THIS THAT GAVE THE COMMISSION ADDITIONAL TOOLS TO PREVENT OIL SPILLS AT THE STATE'S OFFSHORE PLATFORMS AND ISLANDS THREE MONTHLY AND ANNUAL INSPECTIONS. AND COMPREHENSIVE SAFETY AUDITS CONDUCTED ON ALL OUT OFFSHORE PLATFORMS AND ISLANDS EVERY FIVE YEARS. MORE RECENTLY THERE BEEN A NUMBER OF LAWS PASSED THAT PROHIBIT THE COMMISSION. FROM ISSUING LEASES FOR NEW INFRASTRUCTURE LIKE PIPELINES THAT WOULD FACILITATE NEW OIL AND GAS DEVELOPMENT IN FEDERAL WATERS AND ON FEDERALLY PROTECTED LAND IN CALIFORNIA. CERTAINLY THERE'S ALSO BEEN A NUMBER OF LAWS PASSED THAT HAVE ADDED TOOLS TO THE COMMISSION'S TOOLBOX TO BETTER MANAGE AND REGULATE EXISTING. STATE OIL AND GAS OPERATIONS AND INFRASTRUCTURE AND PROTECT THE STATE FROM LIABILITY. NOW TO PROVIDE A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE EXISTING OFFSHORE OPEN OPERATIONS NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. SO THIS SHOWS THE LONG BEACH OPERATIONS- THE WILMINGTON FIELD OFFICER LONG BEACH IS THE FOURTH LARGEST OIL FIELD IN NORTH AMERICA THROUGH A SERIES OF STATUTES AND AGREEMENTS THE CITY OF LONG BEACH IS CONSIDERED THE OPERATOR. AND CALIFORNIA RESOURCES CORPORATION IS THE CITY'S CONTRACTOR AND THE STATE RECEIVES A SIGNIFICANT SHARE OF NET PROFITS GENERATED AT THE LONG BEACH UNIT THE FOR OIL ISLANDS AND THE WEST WOMAN OPERATIONS PRIMARY LOCATED UNDER THE PORT OF LONG BEACH. AS THIS OPERATION IS NOT MANAGE FOR A TYPICAL LESSOR LESSEE RELATIONSHIP THE COMMISSION VERY LIMITED AUTHORITY OVER THE MANAGEMENT OF THESE OPERATIONS. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. HOWEVER BASED ON A SERIES OF STATUTES AND AGREEMENTS THE STATE IS LIABLE FOR THE MAJORITY OF THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PLUGGING AND ABANDONMENT OF THE WELLS ASSOCIATED WITH THE WILMINGTON OPERATION. BY STATUTE THE STATE HAS SET ASIDE THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR THIS PROGRAM THIS LEAVES APPROXIMATELY FIVE HUNDRED MILLION IN UNFUNDED LIABILITIES. THE ESTIMATES TO CUT COMPLETELY PLUG AND ABANDON THE HUNDREDS OF WELLS IS OVER EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. YOU CAN SEE ON THIS SLIDE THE REVENUE- GENERATED- TO THE STATE FROM THESE OPERATE. AS WELL AS THE WELL COUNTY AND THE FIELD LIFE AS ESTIMATED BY C. R. C. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. I'M NOT GOING TO SHARE AND MATRIX FIRST AND THEN A COUPLE OF MAPS TO HELP PROVIDE ADDITIONAL CONTEXT OF THE OFFSHORE OIL AND GAS LEASES THE COMMISSION MANAGES. SO THESE ARE THE ELEVEN ACTIVELY PRODUCING LEASES- ORGANIZED BY- AREA SANTA BARBARA I'LL SERVE INTERACT ON TO LA IN ORANGE COUNTY. ALONG WITH THEIR WELL COUNT LIABILITY PROTECTION AND A FISCALLY THE LAST FISCAL YEAR IS REVENUE AND GENERATION. AND SANTA BARBARA CHANNEL WE- THE COMMISSION MANAGES TO OFFSHORE LEASES THOSE WELLS ARE DRILLED FROM ONSHORE AND GO OFF INTO THE OFFSHORE RESERVOIRS. WE HAVE EIGHT ACTIVE PIPELINE LEASES CONNECTING FEDERAL PLATFORMS ONSHORE PROCESSING FACILITIES AND THEN- NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. THIS IS THE SANTA BARBARA CHANNEL- THE FEDERAL PLATFORM SUBJECT TO THE DECOMMISSIONING PROGRAMMATIC EIS THAT I MENTIONED EARLIER OUR HARVEST HERMOSA HILL DOGO HABITAT HOW CHEN HOGAN GRACE AND GAIL. IN ORANGE COUNTY NEXT SLIDE PLEASE AS WE MOVE DOWN THE COAST. WE HAVE- AT ONE LEAST ASSOCIATE WITH THE ISLAND SHAFEE. ONE LEASE ASSOCIATE WITH PLATFORM AFTER PLATFORM ESTHER'S OPERATED BY DE CORPS. WE HAVE FIVE LEASES ASSOCIATED WITH PLATFORM AND ME PLATFORM AMAZON BY C. R. C. TO LEASES ASSOCIATE WITH PLATFORM EVER. HAVE A IS- OPERATED BY DE CORPS WE HAVE TWO ACTIVE PIPELINE LEASES CONNECTING FEDERAL PLATFORMS ONSHORE PROCESSING FACILITIES AND THAT INCLUDES THE ORANGE COUNTY OIL SPILL- PIPELINE CLASS- FROM ALLEY AND WE HAVE THREE ACTIVE PIPELINE LEASES CONNECTING AFTER EVEN ME TO ENTRE. FACILITIES. SO AS PART OF THESE OIL AND GAS LEASES AND THE PIPE PLAINLY SAYS THE COMMISSION REQUIRES THE OPERATORS TO PAY FOR YOUR MARKET RENTS AND ROYALTIES. MAINTAIN BONDS INSURANCE AND OTHER LIABILITY PROTECTION INSTRUMENTS TO PROTECT THE STATE. AND AS I MENTIONED EARLIER THE COASTAL SANCTUARY ACT PROHIBITS THE COMMISSION FROM ISSUING NEW OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION LEASES. THAT POLICY HAS SET THE FOUNDATION FOR THE WHERE THE COMMISSION FINDS ITSELF TODAY PRIORITIZING AND LEADING THE STATE IN THE DECOMMISSIONING PHASE OF MANY OF THE STATE'S OFFSHORE FACILITIES PART OF MY PRESENTATION. THE COMMISSION RECOGNIZES THAT THE EFFECTS AND S. ASSOCIATE WITH THE CLIMATE CRISIS REQUIRE THE STATE TO DRAMATICALLY CHANGE THE WAY IT PRODUCES AND CONSUMES ENERGY. AND THAT THERE IS A BRIDGE TO THE SUSTAINABLE FUTURE. THE COMMISSION IS COMMITTED TO DOING ITS PART IN BUILDING THAT BRIDGE AS A LANDOWNING AGENCY THAT OVERSEES THE MANAGEMENT OF FOUR MILLION ACRES OF PUBLIC LANDS. WE ARE DIDN'T WORKING DILIGENTLY TO DIVERSIFIER LEASING AND REVENUE GENERATING PORTFOLIO. AND POSITION OURSELVES TO BE PARTNERS IN FACILITATING OUR CLEAN ENERGY FUTURE. THIS INCLUDES PURSUING PARALLEL TRACKS OF FACILITATING GEOTHERMAL SOLAR AND WIND DEVELOPMENT. WHILE ACTIVELY WORKING WITH OUR STATE PARTNERS AND OUR LESSEES TO ABANDON IDLE WELLS HELLO AT HEAD AND CAL GEMS REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. AND SURE THE STATE IS ADEQUATELY PROTECTED THROUGH BONDS SINKING FUNDS PROPERTY LIENS AND OTHER MECHANISMS. DECOMMISSIONING OFFSHORE FACILITIES LIKE A PLATFORM HOLLY AND RINCON ISLAND ORPHAN LEGACY WELLS AND IMPLEMENTING ROBUST AND COMPREHENSIVE SPILL PREVENTION INSPECTION PROGRAMS. IN FACT IN THE LAST SIX YEARS THE COMMISSION HAS FACILITATED THE TERMINATION OF TEN OFFSHORE OIL AND GAS LEASES RETURNING OVER TWENTY THOUSAND ACRES OF THE COASTAL SANCTUARY. AND IN CONCLUSION THE COMMISSION UNDERSTANDS ITS PLACE BOTH IN CALIFORNIA'S HISTORY AND ITS FUTURE. OF FOSSIL FUEL SUPPLY AND DEMAND DEPENDENCY. THE COMMISSION IS COMMITTED TO A JUST TRANSITION WHILE RESPONSIBLY MANAGING THE STATE'S EXISTING OIL AND GAS LEASES. CONSISTENT WITH THE LAW AND ENSURING THE STATE IS PROTECTED FROM LIABILITY ASSOCIATED WITH pOPERATIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU FOR THAT AT FOR THAT REALLY COMPREHENSIVE OVERVIEW. AND I KNOW YOU WILL BE JOINING US- ON A COUPLE OF OUR OTHER PANELS INCLUDING THE NEXT PANEL WHICH- IS FOCUSED. AROUND TO AT IT KIND OF DEEPER DIVE INTO COST LIABILITY AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS ASSOCIATED WITH DECOMMISSIONING. I DO JUST HAVE ONE CLARIFYING QUESTION SO. THAT WOULD MAKE SURE THAT I UNDERSTOOD CORRECTLY SO I. DID YOU SAY THAT THE STATE HAS THE PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE PLUGIN AND ABANDONMENT- FOR. THE AT LONG BEACH AND WEST WILMINGTON. FIELDS YES OKAY AND THAT THERE IS CURRENTLY A FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR ANTICIPATED UNFUNDED LIABILITY ASSOCIATED WITH THAT YEAH OKAY ALL RIGHT. ARE THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS BEFORE YOU AT THE NUMBER OF YES- THIS WITH REGARD TO THOSE OIL FIELDS YOU MATCH. IN LONG BEACH YESTERDAY PROBABLY WHO I MET IN EVERYBODY HERE VOTED I DON'T KNOW THE VOTE COUNT BUT YOU VOTED FOR A BILL TO INCREASE THAT CAP BECAUSE THE THRESHOLD I WAS TOO LOW TO ULTIMATELY- YOU KNOW. TAKE TO OF WHEN THOSE WHEN THOSE WELLS ARE ABANDONED TO. TO CLOSE THEM BECAUSE WHEN YOU KNOW WHAT IT WAS A BAD IT'S A COMPLEX PROCESS OBVIOUSLY PUT A CAP ON THE WALKWAY DOWN ON A- MUCH MUCH MORE COMPLEX. TO PROPERLY ABANDON A WELL THERE'S COMPANIES THAT JUST HANDLE ABANDONED WELLS IT'S A REAL PROCESS. SO- BUT AGAIN YESTERDAY WE DID HAVE A BILL BELIEVES AB THREE FIVE THREE IF I'M CORRECT. GO THROUGH OF THE ASSEMBLY FLOOR- WITHOUT A OPPOSITION IF I RECALL CORRECTLY TO THE SUPPORT INCREASING THAT CAPSULE ULTIMATELY WE CANNOT CLOSE AS WELL AS AN APPROPRIATE FASHION WHEN THE TIME COMES. YES THANK YOU. IF UP SORRY I WAS JUST GOING TO ADD. ON TO THAT STATE HAS RECEIVED AND CONTINUES TO RECEIVE A SIGNIFICANT SHARE OF THE REVENUE THAT'S GENERATED. THE NET PROFITS THAT ARE GENERATED AT THE LONG BEACH OPERATIONS WHICH IS WHY PURSUANT TO. VARIOUS STATUTES AND AGREEMENTS THE STATE IS ALSO LIABLE FOR PLUGGING AND ABANDONING THE WELLS AT THE- END OF THE ECONOMIC LIFE OF THOSE FIELDS. AND SO. THAT LEGISLATURE CREATED THIS OIL TRUST FUND WHERE TWO MILLION DOLLARS OF THE REVENUE THE STATE RECEIVES EVERY MONTH WOULD GO INTO THIS. ABANDONMENT FUND BUT IT WAS CAPPED AT THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. SO WE- WILL NEED TO BE LEGISLATION TO INCREASE THAT CAP. YES ASSEMBLY MEMBER BUT THANK YOU AND SPEAKING OF THE COMPLEXITY OF- DEALING WITH THESE SITUATIONS AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR- TESTIMONY- IT. HOW IS IT DETERMINED. WHAT EXACTLY IS PART OF THE DECOMMISSIONING- OF A OF A WELL BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT WHAT WE ALL ARE FAMILIAR WITH ITS ABOVE WATER BUT THERE'S A HECK OF A LOT THAT'S BELOW IN THIS PIPELINE SEN. AND WHAT NOT SO HOW HOW IS THAT DETERMINED YEAH SO- THE WAY I LIKE TO LOOK AT- THE- AND DECOMMISSIONING OF ENTIRE FACILITY YOU HAVE THE PLATFORM'S YOU HAVE THE WELLS THAT ARE SUB SURFACE GOING VERY DEEP INTO BELOW THE OCEAN FLOOR. YOU HAVE VARIOUS PIPELINES- THAT TRANSPORT OIL WATER GAS AND ALSO POWER CABLES. THE FIRST STEP IN DECOMMISSIONING IS TO PLUG AND ABANDON THE WELLS SO THAT THERE IS NO MORE RISK OF ANY KIND OF RE PRESSURIZATION OR OIL SPILL ASSOCIATED WITH THOSE THAT'S THE STAGE WE'RE IN A PLATFORM HOLLY. AND SO YOU GO IN YOU PLUG AND ABANDON EACH WELL- AT AT AND YOU HAVE A PROGRAM PLAN FOR EACH OF THOSE WELLS THAT. ARE DEVELOPED- BY THE OPERATOR WITH CONSULTATION FROM THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION AND CAL JAM AND CAL CHEN HAS TO APPROVE THOSE WELL. ABANDONMENT PROGRAMS. I ALL THE WELLS ARE PLUGGED. AND COMPLETELY PLUGGED AND ABANDONED- TO THE REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS THERE'S A VERY LIMITED- AT. RISK FOR AN OIL SPILL. AT THAT POINT- WE WILL WHETHER IT'S THE STATE CONDUCTING IT OR THE OPERATOR- CONDUCT A FEASIBILITY STUDY ABOUT WHAT IT'S GOING TO TAKE. TO REMOVE THE PLATFORM AND THE ASSOCIATED INFRASTRUCTURE. AND AT LEAST WITH PLATFORMS THERE COULD BE FULL REMOVABLE PARTIAL REMOVAL OR KEEPING IT ALL IN PLACE AND SO ALL OF THAT IS EVALUATED. AND THEN BASED ON THAT FEASIBILITY STUDY WE CONDUCTED THE SEQUIN ALICE'S WHICH IS- NOW TYPICALLY ANY IR. PRIOR DECOMMISSIONING EFFORTS LIKE FOR THE CHEVRON- FOR HM- FOR EACH PLATFORMS. THAT WERE- THAT DECOMMISSIONED IN THE MID NINETEEN NINETIES AND ALSO THE BELMONT ISLAND- PLATFORM OFFSHORE LONG BEACH IN THE EARLY TWO THOUSANDS THOSE ARE ALL ACTUALLY ANALYZED UNDER A MITIGATED NEGATIVE NEGATIVE DECLARATION PURSUANT TO SEE WHAT BUT NOW WE DO ER'S. AND THEN FROM THERE- THE COMMISSION STATE LANDS COMMISSION MAKES THE DETERMINATION ON. THE EXTENT OF DECOMMISSIONING AND REMOVAL SO- THEY CAN DECIDE- AT AT A PROPERLY NOTICED PUBLIC MEETING FOR FULL PLATFORM INFRASTRUCTURE REMOVAL OR SOMETHING- LESS THAN THAT DEPENDING ON. THE BENEFITS AND RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH AND IS THAT A- IF YOU WILL A CRITERIA BASED DECISION- ARE THEIR CRITERIA IN THE LAW OR- REGULATIONS. THAT GUIDE THAT DECISION MAKING OR MANDATE CERTAIN DIRECTIONS IN THE DECISION MAKING I'M NOT SPECIFICALLY NOT TO KIND OF US US US. A DIRECT CRITERIA OR CONDITIONS- THE COMMISSION IS INFORMED BY THE SEQUIN ALICE'S. AND ALSO WHAT'S IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE STATE EIGHT. AND SO THEY HEAR- COMMUNITY MEMBERS ENVIRONMENTALISTS EXPERTS- OBVIOUSLY ALL OF OUR LOCAL AND STATE AND FEDERAL RESOURCE AGENCY PARTNERS TO DETERMINE WHAT THE BEST COURSE OF ACTION IS IN TERMS OF REMOVAL. AND DECOMMISSIONING. AS FOR BRYANT. THANK YOU AND THANK YOU FOR THAT PRESENTATION- YOUR YOUR COMMENTS ABOUT POTENTIALLY NEEDING TO RAISE THE CAP IN THE STATE'S LIABILITY I THINK ARE REALLY IMPORTANT I THINK ALSO POINTING OUT THAT THE STATE MAKES MONEY ON THIS IT'S IMPORTANT TO MILLION A MONTH TO GO TOWARDS OF PLUGGING THESE WELLS I THINK IT'S GOOD POLICY I AM CURIOUS THOUGH STATUTORILY ARE THERE ANY REQUIREMENTS ON THE COMPANIES THAT ARE ALSO REAPING. I JOIN NORMA'S PROFITS FROM THIS WORK TO PUT INTO MILLION A MONTH OR ANY KIND OF MONEY INTO THE PLUGIN WHERE IS THIS ONLY THE STATE'S BURDEN AT THIS CURRENT TIME SO THAT STATE IS- PRIMARILY LIABLE FOR THAT PLUGGING AND ABANDONMENT OF WELLS ASSOCIATED WITH THE LONG BEACH OPERATIONS ONLY THAT IS A VERY UNIQUE SITUATION- THAT IS REALLY DICTATED BY A NUMBER OF STATUTES AND AGREEMENTS THE STATE ENTERED INTO WELL OVER- FORTY FIFTY YEARS AGO- FOR THE REST OF THE OPERATIONS THAT ARE AND OPERATED UNDER A TYPICAL LESS OR LESS. RELATIONSHIP FOR THE STATE THROUGH THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION AS THE LESSOR AN THE OPERATOR IS A LESSEE PURSUANT TO THOSE LEASES THE LAST SEATS AND THE OPERATORS ARE REQUIRED TO RESTORE THE LEAST PROMISES TO THEIR NATURAL CONDITIONS SO THAT WOULD MEAN THE STANDARD IS FULL REMOVAL AND FULL PLUGGING AND ABANDONMENT OF ALL THE WELLS AND THAT IS. THAT THE COST OF THE OPERATOR. SO AT THIS TIME IT GOING TO GO AHEAD. WELCOME SOME ADDITIONAL PANELISTS FOR PANEL TO. MISLI HAS HE WILL BE PARTICIPATING IN PENALTIES WE CAN ASK ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS JUST WHERE. THAT SUIT WITH THAT- WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND WELCOME LINDA CROP FROM THE ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE CENTER AND DEMAND ECONOMY AND THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL AND- HOT PANEL TO IS GOING TO ADD DIVE INTO. ISSUES AROUND DECOMMISSIONING COST LIABILITY AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS. UP WITH THAT WELCOME THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US. I BELIEVE WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND ADD BEGIN WITH MISS CROP. WE'VE GOT IF YOU THREE. THANK YOU AND GOOD MORNING- I'M REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THIS HEARING AND WANT TO THANK EACH YEAR AND ALL THE MEMBERS- FROM THE PREPARATION THAT WENT INTO PROVIDING THIS OVERVIEW TODAY- I'M LINDA KROP I AM THE CHIEF COUNSEL OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE CENTER WHICH IS A PUBLIC INTEREST ENVIRONMENTAL LAW FIRM HEADQUARTERED IN SANTA BARBARA WE WERE FOUNDED AS A DIRECT RESULT OF THE NINETEEN SIXTY NINE. OIL SPILL- WE ALSO- LIVE AND WORK RIGHT NEAR THE TWENTY FIFTEEN PLAINS PIPELINE OIL SPILL SO I CAN DEFINITELY EMPATHIZE WITH WHAT- BROKE DOWN IN ORANGE COUNTY HAVE BEEN GOING THROUGH- WE ALSO REPRESENT THE SURFRIDER FOUNDATION REGARDING BE. SEVERAL UPCOMING PROGRAMMATIC ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENT THAT I'LL TALK ABOUT BRIEFLY- WHEN A LEAD OFF BY SAYING THAT WE ARE IN THE- VERY EXCITING MOMENT FOR THOSE WHO DO WANT TO SEE THE PHASE OUT OF OFFSHORE OIL. AND A DISPOSITION OF THE PLATFORMS- WE ARE TURNING THE PAGE FROM OIL DEVELOPMENT TO PLATFORM TO COMMISSIONING. THANK WE HOPE THIS HEARING WILL EDUCATE LEGISLATORS AND THE PUBLIC REGARDING THE STATE'S EXISTING LAW PERTAINING TO DECOMMISSIONING OF COURAGE PEOPLE TO PARTICIPATE IN CURRENT. ENVIRONMENTAL AGENCY REVIEW PROCESSES AND I'M WONDERING IF- JENNIFER CAN PUT THE- MY SLIDE SHOW UP. THE POWER POINT. GREAT THANK YOU OUR NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. SO THERE ARE TWENTY SEVEN PLATFORMS OFF THE COAST OF CALIFORNIA EIGHT ARE PERMANENTLY SHUT DOWN IN THE DECOMMISSIONING PROCESS UP PLUGGING AND ABANDONMENT IS UNDER WAY PRIMARILY EMPLOYING FOR WORKERS. WHEN THESE PLATFORMS WERE INSTALLED THE OIL COMPANIES WERE REQUIRED TO REMOVE ALL STRUCTURES WHEN PRODUCTION CEASED AND RESTORE THE MARINE ENVIRONMENT TO ITS NATURAL CONDITION. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. THERE ARE NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR CONGRESS PASSED THE NATIONAL FISHING AND HANDSOME ACTOR PROMOTE ARTIFICIAL REEFS. ENACTMENT OF THIS LAW WAS FOLLOWED BY REGULATIONS ALLOWING AN EXCEPTION TO THE REQUIREMENT THAT OFFER PLATFORMS MUST BE FULLY REMOVED AND DISPOSEDI'M SURE. THAT REGULATIONS ALLOW PLATFORMS TO BE USED IN THE CREATION OF AN ARTIFICIAL REEF PURSUANT TO A NATIONAL ROOF PLAN APPROVED BY KNOW WHAT. SUBSEQUENTLY ANOTHER REGULATION WAS PASSED ALLOWING A PLATFORM TO BECOME PART OF A STATE ARTIFICIAL REEF PROGRAM SO LONG AS THE STATE ASSUMES TITLE IN LIABILITY OF THE STRUCTURE. AND U. S. COAST GUARD NAVIGATIONAL REQUIREMENTS ARE MET. THE COAST GUARD USUALLY REQUIRES AN EIGHTY FIVE FOOT CLEARANCE BETWEEN THE SEA SURFACE AND REMAINING STRUCTURE. FOR MANY YEARS CALIFORNIA DID NOT HAVE A PROGRAM THAT MET THESE FEDERAL CRITERIA CALIFORNIA DO YOU HAVE AN ARTIFICIAL REEF PROGRAM. BUT IT WAS FOCUSED ON CONSTRUCTING REEFS THAT MIMIC NATURAL REEFS PREFERRING MATERIAL SUCH AS QUARRY ROCK AND CONCRETE STOP ALL. EFFORTS TO CHANGE STATE LAW STARTED AFTER THE NINETEEN NINETY SIX REMOVAL OF THE FOR EACH PLATFORM IS BUYING CHEVRON I'M NOT SURE SOME SANTA BARBARA COUNTY- AT THAT TIME THE INDUSTRY SOFT PERMISSION TO AVOID REQUIREMENTS FOR FULL REMOVAL- BUT NEVERTHELESS- BECAUSE WE DID NOT HAVE A STATE LAWFUL REMOVAL WAS STILL REQUIRED. BEGINNING IN NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT THERE WERE SEVERAL ATTEMPTS TO ENACT LEGISLATION TO ASSIST DALGLEISH A STATE ROUTES TO REPROGRAM BUT THEY FELT INTERFACE OF SUBSTANTIAL OPPOSITION. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. WHAT CHANGED IN TWENTY TEN WHEN AB TWO FIVE OH THREE PASSED. THIS WAS THE CALIFORNIA MARINE RESOURCES LEGACY ACT. THE BILL PASSED IN LARGE PART BECAUSE IT REQUIRED A ROBUST SCIENTIFIC INQUIRY COMPARING THE IMPACT AND BENEFITS TO THE MARINE ENVIRONMENT A FULL REMOVAL VERSUS PARTIAL REMOVAL AND THEN NOT IN OUR OFFICE WOULD RESULT IN A DETERMINATION OF WHICH OPTION WOULD RESULT IN A NET BENEFIT TO CREATE ENVIRONMENTS. THE SCIENTIFIC ANALYSIS WAS INCLUDED IN SECTION SIX SIX ONE THREE OF THE LAW WHICH WAS BASED ON A FEW THOUSAND UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA DECOMMISSIONING REPORT QUESTIONED. WHETHER ONE OIL PLATFORM IN AND OF ITSELF- CREATED ECOLOGICAL BENEFIT. THE BILL ALSO PASSED BECAUSE THERE WAS A COST SAVING OUR OUR KASHIRI PROVISION AND BECAUSE THE BILL INCLUDED AN INDEMNIFICATION PROVISION. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. THE SCIENTIFIC ANALYSIS INCLUDING THE TWENTY TEN LAW IS CRITICAL TO DECISION MAKING REGARDING POPCORN DECOMMISSIONING I WILL FOCUS ON SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WILL NEED TO BE ADDRESSED AS EACH PLATFORM IS REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS FIRST ECOLOGICAL ISSUES. ALSO NEED TO CONSIDER SETTING AND PRESENCE OF OTHER HABITAT IN THE VICINITY EACH PLATFORM IS DIFFERENT THEY RANGE IN DEPTH FROM THIRTY EIGHT TO ALMOST TWELVE HUNDRED FEET. THE PLATFORM WILL HAVE TO BE TOPPLED BOB OR MOVED TO COMPLY WITH NAVIGATIONAL SAFETY REQUIREMENTS CONSIDER HOW THE LOSS OF THE TOP OF THE POPS FOR ME AFFECT REPRODUCTION AND OTHER ISSUES IDENTIFIED IN THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA REPORT. INCIDENTALLY THE THREE PLATFORMS IN STATE WATERS OFF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ARE ALL INVESTED EIGHTY FIVE FEET SO THEY MAY NOT EVEN BE ELIGIBLE FOR PARTIAL DECOMMISSIONING UNDER COAST GUARD NAVIGATIONAL REQUIREMENTS WHAT THE EFFECTIVE CLEANING OPERATIONS MAY BE ON THE SEA LIFE BUT THE PLATFORMS. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. ANOTHER ECOLOGICAL ISSUE RELATES TO THE HABITAT VALUE OF THE STRUCTURE- WHICHEVER REMOVED THE FORAGE PLATFORMS OFFSHORE SUMMERLIN THE COMPANY LEFT BEHIND MASSIVE HI KATIE SPAHN'S PIPES AND DEAD SHELLS THE PILES ARE TWENTY FIVE TO TWENTY EIGHT FEET IN HEIGHT AND A HUNDRED EIGHTY TO TWO HUNDRED SIXTY SIX FEET IN DIAMETER AND WHAT AFTER WE MOVED AMOUNTS CHEVRON ASSERTD THAT THEY WERE PROVIDING VALUABLE HABITAT. HOWEVER THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION CONDUCTED A STUDY IN TWO THOUSAND ONE THAT THAT THAT THAT DETERMINE THAT AMOUNTS WERE NOT. PROVIDING HABITAT VALUE. NO SLIDE PLEASE. ANOTHER ECOLOGICAL ISSUES THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF FISHING ONCE WELL PRODUCTION CEASES THE STRUCTURES MAY BE OPEN TO FISHING THE SCIENTIFIC ANALYSIS MUST CONSIDER HOW THAT WILL AFFECT THE MARINE ENVIRONMENT. NEXT PLEASE. FINALLY A TWO THOUSAND SIX REPORT DISCLOSED THE PRESENCE OF NON NATIVE SPECIES ON OFFSHORE PLATFORMS THIS SHOULD BE ADDRESSED IN THE SCIENTIFIC ANALYSIS AS WELL. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. ANOTHER ISSUE THAT MUST BE ADDRESSED IN THE SCIENTIFIC ANALYSIS IS THE PRESENCE OF TOXIC CONTAMINATION THERE ARE TWO THOUSAND ONE STATE LANDSCAPE STUDY OF THE CHEVRON MOUNTS SIGNIFICANT LEVELS OF MANY TOXIC POLLUTANTS INCLUDING ARSENIC HEAVY METALS PETROLEUM HYDROCARBONS AND PH'S. BOB FORM SITES ARE NOT COMPLETELY RESTORED AND CLEANED UP WE WILL FACE A PROBLEM OF LEGACY POLLUTION IN THE MARINE ENVIRONMENT. THEREFORE ANY REVIEW OF DECOMMISSIONING OPTIONS WILL NEED TO CONSIDER THE PRESENCE OF POTENTIAL TOXIC CONTAMINATION IN THE MARINE ENVIRONMENT IF. THE SITES ARE NOT FULLY CLEANED UP AND RESTORED. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. FORTUNATELY SOME STUDIES ARE ALREADY UNDERWAY THAT WILL HELP INFORM THE SCIENTIFIC ANALYSIS AND THE ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW FOR EACH PROPERTY COMMISSION PROPOSAL. ZERO OCEAN ENERGY MANAGEMENT IS PREPARING A PROGRAMMATIC ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENT FOR ALL PLATFORMS OFFSHORE CALIFORNIA- WE'RE REALLY EXCITED- AND AS- JENNIFER LOOKING AS YOU POINTED OUT BE A DRAFT ENVIRONMENT IMPACT STATEMENT IS DUE OUT FEBRUARY. ALL WE'VE ALREADY SUBMITTED A SCOPING COMMENTS AND SO WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD- TO REVIEWING THIS BROUGH IMPACT STATEMENT WHICH WILL EVALUATE DECOMMISSIONING IMPAX ALTERNATIVES WHICH COULD BE- YOUR PARTIAL VERSUS FULL REMOVAL BUT ALSO COULD LOOK AT ALTERNATIVE TECHNOLOGIES. AND MITIGATION MEASURES- THIS. I STATEMENT WILL FULFILL OUR EXISTING STATE LEGAL REQUIREMENTS FOR ENSURING COMPREHENSIVE ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW BOSTON SCIENTIFIC ANALYSIS COMPARING. VARIOUS DECOMMISSIONING OPTIONS ADDITIONALLY- WE'RE GOING TO- SEE OUR FIRST PROJECT SPECIFIC ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW STUDENTS THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION WAS EXPECTED TO. BEGIN THE ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW PROCESS FOR PLATFORM HOLY DECOMMISSIONING THIS YEAR SO WE WILL HELP OFFICE PROGRAMMATIC LOOK AT THE IMPACTS AND ALTERNATIVES AND MITIGATION MEASURES WE WILL ALSO HAVE THE BENEFIT OF EIGHT PLATFORM SPECIFIC ANALYSIS. SO WORKSITE THAT WE WERE MAKING THIS TRANSITION PROBLEMS ARE BEING DECOMMISSIONED GOT THESE GREAT STUDIES REPORTS COMING UP AND WE ENCOURAGE ALL THOSE WHO ARE INTERESTED IN TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PROCESS- WE ARE ALSO FORTUNATE THAT WE ALREADY PASSED- A STATE LAW THAT SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSES DECOMMISSIONING ALTERNATIVES AND REQUIRES. ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW AS WELL AS A ROBUST SCIENTIFIC ANALYSIS. AND WHAT THAT NEXT SLIDE PLEASE- WE DO HAVE SOME INFORMATION ON OUR WEBSITE- BUT THE LINK IN THE SLIDE HERE. AND THE LOOK FORWARD TO ANY QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS AT THE END OF THE PANEL PRESENTATIONS AND I'LL PASS IT OVER TO DAMON A COPY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU IS CRAP. GREAT THANKS SO MUCH LINDA AND GOOD MORNING- MY NAME IS DAMOND THEY GOT ME I'M A SENIOR ATTORNEY WITH THE NATURISTS TENSE COUNCIL- THAT WAS A GREAT PRESENTATION THANK YOU LINDA I THINK AGAIN ATTIC THE SLIDES DOWN- THANK YOU TO SOMEONE ASSEMBLY MEMBER THANK YOUS ASSEMBLY MEMBER PETRIE-NORRIS IN YOUR STAFF ASSEMBLY MEMBER RIVAS AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER BLOOM FOR HOLDING THIS IMPORTANT HEARING. I WILL ECHO WHAT LINDA SAID IN THAT THIS IS A VERY TIMELY GIVEN EVERYTHING THAT'S HAPPENING AROUND PLATFORM DECOMMISSIONING AND IN THE WAKE OF LAST OCTOBER'S OIL SPILL I THINK WE'RE ALL STILL RECOVERING- FROM THE SHOCK AND COLLECTIVE OUTRAGE- THAT THIS THESE OIL DISASTERS KEEP HAPPENING- BUT I'M GRATEFUL FOR YOUR EFFORTS. TO HARNESS THIS OUTRAGE AND KEEP THIS ISSUE IN THE SPOTLIGHT SO THE PUBLIC CAN GET THE INFORMATION- IT THE DECOMMISSIONING EFFORTS THE PART ABOUT AS THOSE I GET UP AND RUNNING. WE HEARD LINDA TALK ABOUT OUR EXISTING FEDERAL AND STATE LAWS AROUND. AND THAT BRINGS US TO NEXT STEPS AND THEN THE TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE- ENVIRONMENT REVIEW PROCESS EITHER HAPPENING- THE BIG TAKEAWAY HERE IS THAT THESE PROCESSES ARE HAPPENING NOW ARE THESE A FORMAL ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW PROCESSES AND THEY'RE HAPPENING AT BOTH THE FEDERAL AND STATE LEVELS. AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL AS YOU HEARD- BASICALLY BACK IN JULY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TOOK ITS FIRST STEPS TOWARD DECOMMISSIONING OIL AND GAS INFRASTRUCTURE OFF THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA COAST SO THE AGENCY THAT YOU HEARD ABOUT BONE THE BUREAU OF OCEAN ENERGY MANAGEMENT. ISSUE WHAT'S CALLED A NOTICE OF INTENT TO PREPARE A PROGRAMMATIC ENVIRONMENT IMPACT STATEMENT A P. E. I. S. UNDER THE NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY ACT OR NEPA AT THE END OF LIFE WAS IT A DOCUMENT THAT WAS RELEASED TO PROVIDE SOME BASIC INFORMATION ABOUT. THE FORTHCOMING REVIEW EFFORT AND INVITED STAKEHOLDERS TO COMMENTS ON THE SCOPE OF THE REVIEW- AND STICKLE OF DONE THAT AND OF THE SCOPING LETTERS ARE OUT THERE FOR US FOLKS TAKE A LOOK AT AND STATE LEVEL AS JENNIFER MENTIONED- THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION IS PLANNING TO START THE SEQUEL PROCESS- FOR THE DECOMMISSIONING PLATFORM HOLLY AS- LINDA HAD MENTIONED LATER THIS YEAR. AND YOU KNOW WITH THE FROM THE COMMISSION'S WEBSITE YOU CAN SEE THAT THEY'RE PLANNING TO HIRE AN ENVIRONMENTAL CONSULTANTS STERN LATER THIS YEAR TO PREPARE THE REVIEW I WHICH IS JENNIFER MENTIONED MOST LIKELY WILL BE AN ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT FOR E. I. R. THIS PROCESS- THE SIMPLE SINGLE PROCESS WILL START LATER THIS YEAR AND WILL INVOLVE ROBUST- PUBLIC AND STAKEHOLDER OUTREACH IS VERY IMPORTANT- AND WILL INFORM THE DECOMMISSIONING PLAN FOR PLATFORM HOLLY- WHICH AS JENNIFER MENTIONED WILL THEN REQUIRE COMMISSION REVIEW AND APPROVAL. AT A PUBLIC MEETING NOW THESE ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES WILL BE COMPREHENSIVE THEY WILL EVALUATE THE COMMISSIONING. IMPACTS ALTERNATIVES AND MITIGATION MEASURES SO IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO. KEEP CLOSE EYE ON THIS. AND I JUST HAVE TO HERE. YOU KNOW IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO STUDY- ALL THE OPTIONS FOR DECOMMISSIONING VERY CAREFULLY. PERSONALLY I GREW UP IN ORANGE COUNTY AND I WAS AS OUT RAISES ANYONE TO HEAR ABOUT THE OIL SPILL THAT WAS THREATENING TO TEAR SPEECHES THAT I WENT TO AS A KID I STILL GO TO AS AN ADULT. I LIKE ALL OF YOU I'M EXCITED THAT THE END OF FOSSIL FUEL PRODUCTION IN CALIFORNIA IS WITHIN REACH. BUT PLATFORM DECOMMISSIONING AS YOU'VE HEARD TODAY IS VERY COMPLEX AND NEEDS TO BE DONE THOUGHTFULLY AND IN A WAY THAT IS MAXIMALLY PROTECTIVE OF THE ENVIRONMENT. THE REVIEW PROCESS THESE ARE DESIGNED TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT HAPPENS. AND AS WE MENTIONED THEY WILL ALSO HELP FULFILL THE EXISTING STATE LEGAL REQUIREMENTS. FOR ENSURING THAT- COMPREHENSIVE ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW AND A ROBUST SCIENTIFIC ANALYSIS. COMPARING THE VARIOUS DEEP MISSING OPTIONS ARE CARRIED OUT. UP AND FINAL NOTE HERE I- YOU KNOW OUR GROUPS ARE HERE TO FOCUS ON THE ENVIRONMENT IMPACTS IN THESE REVIEW PROCESSES THAT ARE UNDER WAY BUT SINCE COST IS ONE OF THE TOPICS COVERED IN THIS HEARING. I DIDN'T WANT TO ECHO- SOME OF THE- THE REMARKS THAT I'VE HEARD AND EMPHASIZE CALIFORNIA STRONG AND LONGSTANDING POLLUTER PAYS POLICY WHICH AND I DO SEE AND MANY OTHER GROUPS VOICE SUPPORT THE OIL INDUSTRY. ABSOLUTELY SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE AND RESPONSIBLE FOR CLEANING UP AFTER THEMSELVES FULL STOP. ALSO THERE WAS A REMARKS EARLIER ABOUT- YOU KNOW THE POTENTIAL FOR DECOMMISSIONING LEADING TO INCREASE EXPORTS THAT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN MOST OF THESE-PLATFORMS WERE INSTALLED BACK IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES AND ARE NOT PRODUCING MUCH OIL SO- THAT THAT'S NOT A CONCERN HERE. AND FINALLY THESE HEARINGS ARE SERVING IMPORTANT PURPOSES AND SO I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE WANT TO HOLD RESPONSIBILITY RESPONSIBLE PARTIES ACCOUNTABLE- WE WANT TO SHINE A LIGHT ON THESE ISSUES AND KEEP THEM IN THE SPOTLIGHT. AND WE WANT TO GET THE WORD OUT TO THE PUBLIC ABOUT THINGS LIKE BEES ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW PROCESSES SO THAT HOPEFULLY PEOPLE WILL PARTICIPATE IN THEM. SO THANK YOU FOR HAVING US HERE AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS. THANK YOU. AND THAT NUMBER FOR REAL SHINS AND MISTER CASE YOU HAVE ANY OTHER ACT COMMENTS THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO PROVIDE RELATED TO- LAST LEVEL THE- TIMELINE OR WHICH IS TIME TO QUESTION YEAH ABOUT THE ONLY OTHER THING I WOULD. LIKE TO MENTION IS EVEN BEFORE- ARE AT SEQUEL PROCESS ON PLATFORM HOLLY WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF- DECOMMISSIONING TWO OTHER OFFSHORE OPERATIONS SO RINCON ISLAND IS OFF SHORE AND VENTURA COUNTY. WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF DOING A FEASIBILITY STUDY FOR THOSE DE COMMISSIONING OPTIONS AND WE'LL START. AT SEA WILL PROCESS THIS YEAR AS WELL AND THEN ALSO ASSOCIATE WITH PLATFORM HOLLY ARE THE WHAT WE REFER TO AS APPEARS FOR TWENTY ONE- FACILITIES AND THESE ARE TWO OF THE LAST TWO REMAINING SHORES OWN PEERS- THAT ARE RELATED TO OIL PRODUCTION. WE PLUGGED AND ABANDONED THAT THOSE WELLS- PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC WE JUST RELEASED THE DRAFT YEAH I ARE FOR FULL REMOVAL OF THOSE FACILITIES- LAST FRIDAY- WITH THE FORTY FIVE DAY PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD WITH THAT WHOLE. DISSIPATION THAT OUR COMMISSION WILL CONSIDER THAT PROJECT IN CERTIFYING THE I. R. IN APRIL. OF THIS YEAR. AND AS YOU OUTLINE DECOMMISSIONING. WHAT IS THE EXPECTED TIME LINE FROM FROM. START TO FINISH. FOR DECOMMISSIONING OF ONE. RIGHT RIGHT WELL IT'S VERY HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON- HOW LONG IT TAKES TO PLUG AND ABANDON WELLS SO FOR EXAMPLE WITH PLATFORM HOLLY- BUT FOR THE PANDEMIC WE WOULD HAVE LIKELY BEEN DONE WITH THE PUP. PLUGGING AND ABANDONMENT- THAT WE ANTICIPATE THE- LEVINE AN ABANDONMENT OF THOSE THIRTY WELLS TO TAKE ANOTHER TWELVE TO EIGHTEEN MONTHS AND THEN- WE CAN START FOCUSING ON THE DECOMMISSIONING AND THAT'S GOING TO BE DEPENDENT ON. AND RECEIVING THAT- RIGHT APPROPRIATION DEPENDING ON THE LEVEL OF THE COMMISSIONING FOR PLATFORM HOLLY AND THAT SORT OF THING BUT GENERALLY SPEAKING-% AND LINDA MAY KNOW THIS BETTER THAN I DO- AND SHE WAS ACTIVELY INVOLVED- THE CHEVRON FOUR EIGHT SHALL MOUNT FOREST THAT PLATFORMS. PROBABLY TOOK I DON'T KNOW BETWEEN FIVE AND TEN YEARS TO FULLY REMOVAL TO REMOVE- FROM THE PLUG IN ABOUT A MINUTE THE WELLS AND THEN FULL HOUR AT THAT AB PLATFORM FACILITY REMOVAL BUT LINDA MAY KNOW THAT BETTER. LINDA ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENT ON THAT ON THE TIMELINE QUESTION. THANK YOU- I DON'T RECALL I THINK IT IT DIDN'T TAKE- SUPER LONG YOU KNOW BACK THEN IS- IS LOOKING AS YOU MENTIONED- BAKER BERMAN NEGATIVE DECLARATION BECAUSE IT WAS BASED ON THE FACT THAT NOT THE FULL PLATFORM WOULD BE REMOVING THE SITE WOULD BE RESTORED TO ITS NATURAL CONDITION AND THEY'RE IN THE RIGHT ENVIRONMENT WOULD BE- RESTORED- WE GOT INVOLVED QUICKLY AFTER THE PLATFORMS HAVE BEEN REMOVED BRANDI'S MASSIVE DEBRIS MOUNDS WERE LAUGHED AT. TWENTY SOME YEARS LATER WE'RE STILL TRYING TO GET THEM CLEANED UP. QUESTION FOR MEMBERS. A COUPLE FOR JENNIFER ACTUALLY SILVA ITHINK IT'S WE'RE CLOSE ENOUGH. PLATFORM HOLLY HOW ARE THEY PLUG MODEL CONCRETE GUY SO I THINK THAT'S HOW IT'S DONE BUT YEAH YOU JUST TAKE A CAP AND PUT IT ON OR IS IT FILLED WITH CONCRETE AND DONE IT'S FILLED WITH CEMENT- AND IT'S A PRETTY INVOLVED PROCESS BECAUSE- MANY OF THESE WELLS ARE RE PRESSURIZING- IN FACT- IF. JUST IN DECEMBER I GAVE AN UPDATE- THAT WE HAD PLAYED IN THREE OF THE THIRTY WELLS AND FINISH THAT AND WE'RE MOVING ON TO THE FOURTH HOWEVER ONE OF THOSE THREE WELLS WERE RE PRESSURIZING- AND SO WE HAVE TO GO BACK IN AND- CONDUCTS SOME ADDITIONAL WORK- ON AND TO BE ABLE TO COMPLETELY AND SAFELY. PLUG AND ABANDON THE SO IT'S PRIMARILY CEMENT- AND- IT'S AT NOW I'M GETTING INTO IT I HAD EXPERTISE THAT'S WELL BEYOND ME. MY GOD. AT WORK THOSE PLANS- TEN. THE TO- THERE'S NO CHIU OF OR BEING A TO LEAVE- AFTER THE COMPLETE PLUG ABANDONED OF. THE TIME WHILE THE COMMISSION PART. PREMIERES AN OPERATOR SAYS IS NOT PRODUCING ENOUGH OIL SO IT'S TIME TO DO COMMISSION THEY COME TO YOU YOU DON'T COME AND TELL ME I HAVE TO DO COMMISSION AND SHUT IT DOWN HOW DOES THAT. PROCESS WORK YEAH SO- SO BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT THE LEGAL- FRAMEWORK- HAS BEEN SET UP SINCE THE NINETEEN FIFTY FIVE CUNNINGHAM SHALL LAUGH- THERE IS NO TERM ASSOCIATED WITH OFFSHORE LEASES SO IT'S THEY DON'T EXPIRE. BY A CERTAIN DATE AND THE TERM IS- ESSENTIALLY IN ECONOMIC TERMS THAT'S DICTATED AND DETERMINED BY THE OPERATE IN THEMSELVES SO EVEN THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION. RENNIE OTHER STATE ENTITY CANNOT COME IN AND SAY IT'S NOT ECONOMIC ANYMORE FOR YOU TO DO THIS OPERATOR YOU HAVE TO DO WE'RE GOING TO TERMINATE YOUR LEASE AND THEY DETERMINED THAT- AND SO- ONCE. AT IT HAS BEEN DETERMINED- BY THEM THAT THEY NO LONGER WANT TO CONTINUE TO PRODUCE WHICH WAS THE SITUATION WHAT THAT FOR EACH- PLATFORMS FOR CHEVRON- THEN DATE AS ESSENTIALLY APPLY TO THE COMMISSION. ALONG WITH ALL THE OTHER REGULATORY ENTITLEMENTS THEY NEED- TO PURSUE THE PLUGGING AND ABANDONMENT OF THE WELLS AND THEN- PURSUE DECOMMISSIONING OF THE FACILITY. THIS IS. THE ONE EXCEPTION IS IF THE LESSEE IS- OR THE AND THE OPERATOR IS NOT. OUR OUT OF COMPLIANCE WITH THEIR LEASE TERMS AND THEN THERE'S A WHOLE- ACT COMPLIANCE EFFORT- THAT WE PURSUE- THAT COULD RESULT IN TERMINATION OF AN OFFSHORE PRODUCTION LEASE THAT HAS NOT OCCURRED IN STATE WATERS. HOWEVER A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO- THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION DID TERMINATE I STATE PIPELINE LEASE THAT CONNECTED A FEDERAL FEDERAL PLATFORM PRODUCTION PLATFORMS TO THE LONG TERM DISABILITY. FOR NON COMPLIANCE WITH THE LEASE TERMS AND THAT IS AN SHUT DOWN THE FEDERAL PLATFORM OKAY. IT WAS AN ACTUAL TO GET THIS STATE HAVE BEEN SAY IN ALL THE FED PLATFORM THAT ARE OUT. THEN I JUST WANT TO REMIND COLLEAGUES. THE PLATTS. OIL SPILL IT HUNT BEACH IT WOULD NOT COME THE PLAQUE. AND ANCHORED. THE PIPELINE THAT RAN FROM THE OFFICE WORK TO THE ON TO THE SHORE. THAT IS WHERE WE GOT TO GET CRITICAL TO WATCH THE BANKERS AND ALL THE SHIPS THAT WE HAVE IN THE PORT. AND THEN ONE OTHER QUESTION I'M GONNA GO FORTH OF DAMON. SO THAT WE'RE NOT USING THAT MUCH OIL IN CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA CONSUMES ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION GALLONS OF OILA DAY. SO FOR NOT PRODUCING IT IN CALIFORNIA STILL GOING TO COME HERE TO BE REFINED. FUEL WE'RE NOT GOING TO CHANGE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. FROM OIL TO ELECTRICITY OVERNIGHT AS CAN BE A SLOW PROCESS WE CAN'T GET TOO FAR AHEAD OF THE GAME AND INCLUDING THANK YOU FOR THAT BUT I JUST WANT A CAR FACTS I THINK THE POINT THAT DAMON WAS THIS AT. IN WAS RELATED TO THE AMOUNT OF PRODUCTION THAT IS BEING GENERATED FROM THE OFFSHORE FACILITIES IN CALIFORNIA SO THAT OFFSHORE PRODUCTION AND IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ACCOUNTS FOR ONE THIRD. OF 1% OF ALL US OIL PRODUCTION I THINK THAT WAS WE'RE STILL CONSUMING ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION GALLONS OF OIL CALIFORNIA AND THAT VERY LITTLE OF IT IS BEING GENERATED BY THIS OFFER A PATH SO IT'S STILL COMING HERE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH JENNIFER JUST A QUICK QUESTION I KNOW YOU POINTED OUT THAT- WOULD REDUCE TO COMMIT BUDGET COMMISSION APPLIED FROM THE OPERATOR DARNLEY'S ON THE HOOK OF FOR THE FOR THE PAYMENT BUT THERE'S BEEN SOME INSTANCES WHERE THAT DOES NOT HAPPEN. IN YOUR OPINION DO YOU THINK THAT THAT CAUGHT COSTS COULD GO TO THE TAXPAYERS. IN THAT SITUATION WHERE THE OPERATOR FILES FOR BANKRUPTCY AND COMPLETELY LIQUIDATE- YES IN FACT THAT- WHAT HAS HAPPENED WITH PLATFORM HOLLY TO A CERTAIN EXTENT. AND RINCON ISLAND- TO A LARGE EXTENT SO. IN BOTH THOSE SITUATIONS THE OPERATOR. FILED FOR- AT BANKRUPTCY AND COMPLETELY- LIQUIDATED AS A- ENTITY- WE'RE ACTUALLY STILL- A LITIGATING AGAINST THE BENNETT CO TRUSTEE. IN BANKRUPTCY COURT TO THIS DAY- WITH PLATFORM HOLLY- THAT PRIOR OPERATOR WAS EXXON MOBIL. AND BETWEEN THE PRIVATE AGREEMENT YOU KNOW SALE AGREEMENT BETWEEN ACTS ON INVENTIV HEALTH- AND THEN ALSO THE CONDITIONS THAT THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION PLACED ON BOTH THE AXON AND VANIKORO. WHEN APPROVING THAT ASSIGNMENT- EXXON IS- STILL RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MAJORITY OF THE PLUGGING AND ABANDONMENT COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PLATFORM HOLLY. AND THE- DECOMMISSIONING BONA FIDE LEGAL DISPUTE BETWEEN THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION AN AXE ON TO THE EXTENT OF THEIR RESPONSIBILITY AND OBLIGATIONS. AND SO THAT IS WHY- AS A SETTLEMENT- WHILE EXXON IS- PAIN FOR THE MAJORITY OF THE PLUGIN IN BAMA AND THE DECOMMISSIONING. THE STATE THROUGH THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION IS- OPERATING AND MAINTAINING. THE PLATFORM THE DAY TO DAY OPERATIONS AND MAKE MAINTENANCE AS WELL AS- AND MEETING ALL THE REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DECOMMISSIONING. CELL THAT WAS THE RESULT OF A SETTLEMENT OF LITIGATION WE KNOW HOW MUCH THAT IS THAT WOULD BE THE DURING LITIGATION HOW MUCH THAT WOULD BE GOING BACK TO THE STATE WHICH ULTIMATELY COMES TO THE TAXPAYER. SO WE HAVE. SECURED OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF BUDGET YEAR. AND TEN MILLION DOLLAR IN. A. HOLLY I'M WITH THE THAT- PLUS WE HAD A TWO TWO DOLLAR BY. WE BELIEVE. WILL COVER THE REMAINING- HAVE COVERED THE STATE'S COST SO FAR AND WILL COVER THE REMAINING STATE CLASS. OR EXXON MOBIL- WE DO NOT HAVE SPECIFIC- COSTS- THAT THEY HAVE SPENT SO FAR THAT THEY'RE ESTIMATING THE COST BUT WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DETERMINE BASED ON THEIR COURT FILINGS IN THE BANKRUPTCY. IS THAT- AT LEAST PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC THEY WERE ESTIMATING THE FULL THEIR COSTS FOR FULL DECOMMISSIONING AT THREE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS. THAT HAS ONLY GONE UP BECAUSE- WE HAD TO STOP. ALL PLUGGING AND ABANDONMENT WORK ONCE THE PANDEMIC HIT- FOR OVER A YEAR BECAUSE OF SAFETY ISSUES- FOR THE- WORKERS ON THE PLATFORM ULTIMATELY THEN THE- THE COST THAT'S COMING FROM THE STATE OF THE COMES FROM THE TAXPAYER IS THAT CORRECT. I YES I BELIEVE SO THANK YOU. THE JET IT'S COMING FROM THE GENERAL FUND. ASSEMBLY BRANDS THANK YOU ARE YOU JUST DESCRIBED TWO DIFFERENT PROCESSES RIGHT ONE. WHERE EXXON MOBIL IS A PARTNER IN PLUGGING THAT WELL THE STATE HAS PUT IN AN AMOUNT. EXXON IS PUTTING THEM OUT IN ANOTHER WHERE. THE OPERATOR. FILE BANKRUPTCY OR CLAIM FINANCIAL INSOLVENCY IN THE STATE IS ON THE HOOK. FOR ALL OF IT. WHICH OF THOSE TWO SITUATIONS WOULD YOU SAY IS MORE COMMONPLACE BECAUSE IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT. THE LATTER WHERE OPERATORS CLAIM INSOLVENCY IS ACTUALLY PART OF THE LARGER GAME OF OWNERSHIP. THAT AS YOU'VE DESCRIBED IN THE LAWSUIT EXXON TRIED TO DO. ABOUT THROUGH THAT THROUGH THE AGREEMENT ENDED UP BEING LIABLE NONETHELESS. YES SO- I CAN ONLY SPEAK TO THOSE OPERATIONS THAT THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION MANAGES- AND OVERSEAS AND SO IN TERMS OF THE REMAINING THREE STATE PLATFORMS AND- OFFSHORE ORANGE COUNTY- B. TWELVE- THE AT. PARENTAL GUARANTEES- FROM THE PRIOR OPERATORS- THAT ASSIGNMENT CONDITIONS THE BONDS AND THE OTHER LIABILITY PROTECTION MEASURES THAT WE HAVE PUT IN PLACE LIKE IT PLATFORM HOLLY. A SINKING FIND THEIR- PLUGGING AND ABANDONING- IDLE WELLS AHEAD OF CAL JAM'S REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS WE HAVE PROPERTY LIENS- IN OUR IN THE STATE'S FAVOR- BETWEEN ALL OF THAT FOR THE REMAINING THREE PLATFORMS PLUS CAL GEMS RECENT- AT SUCCESS SAID REESE- GETTIN BONDS. FROM FREEPORT MAC MORAN FOR PLATFORM ASTOR AND EVA AND THEN C. R. C. FOR PLATFORM AND ME- I DON'T SEE THE SAME SITUATION HAPPENING THERE THAT I. HAVE SEEN AT RINCON ISLAND RINCON ISLAND WAS ONE OF THOSE SITUATIONS WHERE- THE COMMISSION AND THE STATE ACTUALLY DID NOT HAVE ANY KIND OF APPROVAL AUTHORITY OVER THE ASSIGNMENT OF THOSE LEASES THE PRIOR OPERATOR. HAD GONE INTO BANKRUPTCY AND THOSE LEASE ASSETS WERE SOLD TO RINCON L. L. P. L. C. THROUGH THE BANKRUPTCY AND THE STATE HAD NO- PROACTIVE ABILITY TO APPROVE OR DENY THAT ASSIGNMENT. SO ALL OF THAT HAPPENED IN FEDERAL BANKRUPTCY- COURT AND SO. THERE WEREN'T TH SAME KINDS OF PROTECTION IS THAT THE STATE HAS NOW. FOR WHAT IS REMAINING IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA MANAGER I AM WHAT. FOUR EIGHT I ASKED SOME QUESTIONS TO ANSWER WHAT I IS NOT THIS IS THE SECOND HEARING THE LAST HEARING WE WERE AT EVERY TIME I TRY TO ASK A QUESTION I WOULD ALWAYS BE THE LAST ONE YOU WOULD CALL IN. AND THEN SECOND IS I WANTED TO ASK A QUESTION EARLIER YOU STOP ME AND THEN WHEN WE WERE ABLE TO ASK QUESTIONS WANT TO EVERYBODY ELSE AND THEN ME. I'M TIRED. OF THE POLITICS THAT YOU LIKE TO PLAY WHEN IT COMES TO THIS OIL SPILL IN ORANGE COUNTY. BECAUSE YOU KNOW THE NEXT TO MY DISTRICT THE OIL SPILL HAPPENED MY DISTRICT AS WELL STOP PLAYING THE GOVERNOR'S PLAYBOOK. OKAY BECAUSE MY CONSTITUENT WANTS ANSWER AND I WOULD APPRECIATE IT THAT I AM TREATED FAIRLY JUST LIKE ANYBODY ELSE ON THIS COMMISSION- AND SO EITHER IT'S SORRY SORRY SORRY LET'S JUST DIALING DOWN HIS. ONE OF THE THINGS. THAT I WORK INCREDIBLY HARD TO DO INCREDIBLY HARD IN pGOVERNMENT IS TO WORK ACROSS THE AISLE. AND EVEN KNOWS THAT THAT IS TRUE. I PARTNER WITH LEGISLATORS OF EVERY EVERY STRIPE SO I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO RIGHT NOW BUT THIS FORUM. IS NOT AN OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU TO GRANDSTAND. OR TRY TO. PLAY POLITICS SO LET'S FOCUS ON THE SUBJECT OF A HEARING. IF I DON'T SEE YOUR HAND RAISED A LITTLE HIGHER. YES THAT'S SURPRISING BECAUSE YOU STOP ME EARLIER BUT THAT'S OKAY AND IS NOT PLAYING POLITICS- I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE OUR AGAIN IS THAT WE'VE CLEARED UP FOR FUTURE. MEETINGS THAT EVERYONE OF US HERE IS TREATED EQUALLY AND WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK- JENNIFER I HAVE A QUESTION. THE YOU MENTIONED THE COST OF THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AND UNFUNDED LIABILITIES POTENTIALLY AN APPROXIMATE I KNOW THAT EVERY POT FORMS ARE DIFFERENT AND THE LAMP AND- THE SIZE EVERYTHING AND HOW LONG IT'S BEEN IN THERE AND ETCETERA- WHAT WHAT IT COSTS TO DECOMMISSION LIKE ONE PLATFORM. LIKE ON AVERAGE YEAH SO WHEN I TALKED ABOUT THAT APPROXIMATELY FIVE HUNDRED MILLION AN UNDIVIDED LOT LIABILITIES THAT HAS TO DO WITH THE LONG BEACH OPERATIONS CALMLY SO THOSE ARE THE FOUR APPLE OIL ISLANDS AND THAT- WELLS THAT- PRODUCE UNDER AND THEY'RE LOCATED UNDERLYING THE PORT OF LONG BEACH. THAT'S A THAT'S A TOTALLY SEPARATE UNIQUE SITUATION- THAT- BECAUSE OF THE HISTORY OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF THAT AREA- FOR PLATFORMS- ALL I CAN. REALLY PROVIDE AS INSIGHT AND I GAS OR AN ESTIMATE IS WHAT WERE AND ANTICIPATING WITH PLATFORM HOLLY- BECAUSE REALLY IT COMES DOWN TO- AT. THE SPECIFICS OF THE PLUGGING AND ABANDONMENT OF THE WELLS WHICH EVERY SINGLE WELL EVEN ON ONE PLATFORM CAN BE VASTLY DIFFERENT IN TERMS OF THEIR COMPLEXITY- AND- THEN THE PLATFORM ITSELF AND THE ASSOCIATED INFRASTRUCTURE SO. WHAT I CAN TELL YOU IS BASED ON WHAT EXXON HAS- ESTIMATED IN THEIR COURT FILINGS IT'S ABOUT THREE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION BUT THAT WAS PRE PANDEMIC AND WE'VE ONLY YOU KNOW GONE UP IN COSTS BECAUSE OF THE PROLONGED DELAY IN BEING ABLE TO PURSUE THE PLUGGING AND ABANDONMENT- PLUS THE HUNDRED AND TEN- MILLION DOLLARS. THAT WAS APPROPRIATED I'M THE STATE LEGISLATURE. PLUS I MEAN IT'S A PLATFORM HOLLY APPEARS TWENTY ONE SOUTH OUR BEST GUESS FOR HALL IS IT'S GOING TO BE FOUR HUNDRED AND FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. MY AND MY NEXT QUESTION IS. WOULD YOU WOULD YOUR AGENCY OR FOR WHICH AGENCY WOULD IT BE- WHO COULD GIVE US KIND OF LIKE A LOOKING AT TWENTY ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN- BUT IN REVENUE. FOR THE STATE AND THAT AND THEN AFFECTS THREE HUNDRED SIXTY THOUSAND JOBS. HAVE WE AWARE WILL OR WHO WILL BE LOOKING INTO HOW WE PLACE THAT TWENTY ONE BILLION AND HELP THE THREE HUNDRED SIXTY THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS TO HAVE JOBS WITH THAT BE YOUR COMMISSION OR WHAT OTHER AGENCIES OUT THERE. THAT IS A GREAT QUESTION I THINK THAT- A LOT OF THAT IS BEING LOOKED AT IN THE PROPOSED GOVERNOR'S BUDGET- THROUGH THE STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNCIL GOBIZ- AT CAL JAM. OUR AGENCY IN TERMS OF- THE ENERGY COMMISSION IN TERMS OF THE WHOLE ENERGY TRANSITION- BOTH THAT LOOKING AT HOW WE NOT ONLY TRANSITION OUR ENERGY PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION BUT ALSO LOOKING AT WHAT THAT MEANS FOR A TRIP DRESSED. TRANSITION FOR WORKERS WHAT THAT MEANS FOR- PLUGGING AND ABANDONING AND DEALING WITH OUR ORPHAN AND LEGACY WELLS AND HOW WE TRANSITION THOSE WORKERS I AM NOT THE BEST PERSON TO SPEAK TO THAT. ALTHOUGH ARE COMMISSION PLAYS A SMALL ROLE IN THAT TRANSITION- AND I THINK THERE MAY BE OTHER PANEL MEMBERS TODAY THAT CAN SPEAK MORE DIRECTLY TO THAT BUT I KNOW THAT THAT IS A HUGE PRIORITY AND THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET.

OR SOMETIME THIS MONTH- AND SO I DIDN'T. WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT SOMEONE IS CURRENTLY MONITORING THESE CARGO SHIPS BECAUSE THIS CAN HAPPEN AGAIN AND WE DON'T WANT TO FIND OUT A YEAR FROM NOW. WHY IT'S LEAKING- AND SO WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT CURRENTLY. YEAH MY BEST GUESS AGAIN I'M NOT THE EXPERT IN THIS AND I DO KNOW THAT IT IS THE SUBJECT OF THE INVESTIGATION THAT THAT FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS PURSUING. BUT IN TERMS OF THE OVERALL MANAGEMENT OF THE VESSEL TRAFFIC- OFFSHORE IN OUR PORTS THAT'S GOING TO BE THE U. S. COAST GUARD THE MARINE EXCHANGE AND THE PORTS OF LONG BEACH AND LOS ANGELES DIRECTLY- AND THAT FROM A SUPPLY CHAIN ISSUE- THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND- HIS ADMINISTRATION.

WE SEE IF WE CAN GET THERE AND BACK ON THE LINE. YES MA'AM I DO I'LL PROBABLY GONNA SELL LIKE AN ECHO TO MISTER JEFFRIES BUT I WANT TO BE CRYSTAL CLEAR. ABOUT WHAT THIS INDUSTRY HAS DONE FOR NOT ONLY MYSELF BUT THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO WORK IN THESE REFINERIES- WE'RE PROUD. TO SUPPORT AND EMPLOY PEOPLE. THAT HAVE SECOND CHANCES ON LIFE WE COME FROM A VERY DIVERSE SOCIAL ECONOMIC BACKGROUNDS AND PEOPLE WITH VARYING COLLEGE EDUCATIONAL DEGREES. ADVANCED DEGREES ALL THE WAY TO THE TRAITS LIKE MR JEFFREY SAID. WE EMPLOY PEOPLE FROM ALL WALKS OF LIFE AND WE'RE PROUD OF THAT. I LISTEN TO PEOPLE DURING MY TENURE AS UNION PRESIDENT HERE. THE RATES WILL BE LITTLE THIS INDUSTRY- FOR PERSONAL REASONS AND POLITICAL AGENDAS IN THE NAME OF GLOBAL WARMING. THAT IS ABSOLUTELY FALSE THIS INDUSTRY CHANGES LIVES I'M PROUD TO BE A PART OF THIS I'M PROUD OF MY FAMILY COMES FROM THIS. I'M PROUD TO REPRESENT THE MEN AND WOMEN THAT WORK IN THIS INDUSTRY. ONE THING I WOULD BE CRYSTAL CLEAR ON. IS THAT WHEN I LISTEN TO PEOPLE FOR ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS TALK ABOUT JUST TRANSITION FOR OUR MEMBERS TO TRANSITION INTO OTHER JOBS. AND REVENUES. THAT IS NOT WHAT WE'RE INTERESTED. WE ARE PROUD OF WHAT. I CAME FROM A VERY UNIQUE BACKGROUND I WAS A PERSONAL BASEBALL PLAYER FROM SENEGAL PADRES FOR FIVE YEARS BEFORE I STARTED WORKING HERE. WANTED MORE DECISION A COMMON TO GET INTO THE WORKFORCE I CHOSE THE OIL GAS INDUSTRY. BECAUSE THEY PROVIDE LIVING WAGE CAREERS. FOR MEN AND WOMEN. ALL MAKE THAT VERY CLEAR THAT THEY DO NOT WORK. ALL WHAT THEY TALK ABOUT INNER GOALS WAS TO. INTO THE STORE AND- THE FOR CYLINDERS VETERANS MEMBERS. WE PROVIDE A SERVICE COME ON IN THE STATE HELLO. THAT IS NEEDED EVERY DAY I HEARD SOMEONE TALK ABOUT ONE POINT THREE ONE POINT TWO BILLION GALLONS OF FOSSIL FUELS USE MR CALIFORNIA. THIS PRODUCT NEEDS TO BE PRODUCED IN CALIFORNIA WE DO WHAT THE SAFEST WE DO WITH THE CLEANEST AND WE DO WHAT THE BEST WAY OF ANYBODY IN THE WORLD. ANOTHER THING THAT I WANT TO BE CRYSTAL CLEAR ON. IS THE CONSTANT RED TAPE. OFF OF THOSE YOU ARE AWARE WE HAVE A VERY. BREATHTAKING AN AMAZING PROJECT TAKING PLACE THE OLD SIXTY SIX MOBILE CALIFORNIA OUR COMPANY HAS FOREST HILL MAYOR. AND ASK TO GET A PROJECT TO PROVIDE RENEWABLE FUELS TO PRODUCE RENEWABLE FUELS FOR LIQUID FUELS WILL USE OF CALIFORNIA HOWEVER THE CONSTANT RED TAPE. IS CONSTANTLY BEING GROWN BY EXTREMIST ACTIVIST THAT STONEWALL THESE PROJECTS THAT KEEP MEN AND WOMEN ON THE BOY BUT HELP ME CALIFORNIA'S CLIMATE AGENDA GOALS AND CLIMATE ACTION GOALS. THIS NEEDS TO STOP WE NEED SUPPORT FROM NOT ONLY STATE LEGISLATORS OR FROM THE PUBLIC AS WELL. WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO INVEST IN THESE FACILITIES OUR STATE TO PROVIDE OVER 3% OF CALIFORNIA'S GDP PER YEAR OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY. SO I WANNA MAKE THAT VERY CLEAR AGAIN THAT THESE EXTREMISTS. YOU'RE NOT REPRESENTS. THE JUST TRANSITION IF YOU WANT TO LOOK AT A MODEL OF WHAT TRANSITION LOOKS LIKE. LOOK AT THE PHILLIPS SIXTY SIX AUDIO REFINERY AND I'M PROUD TO BE PARTNERING WITH MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS IN THE TRADES ARE GONNA HELP BUILD THIS FACILITY IN MAKING A TECHNOLOGICALLY ADVANCED WORLD LEADER AND MODEL FOR COMPANIES. TO FOLLOW FOR GENERATIONS TO COME. THANK YOU FOR MUCH THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR US AND DATA FOR EACH INTO. RE ABLE TO GET ERIN BACK ON THE PHONE. I AM HERE NOW CAN YOU HEAR ME OK YES WONDERFUL YES WE CAN THINK SO MUCH AND- WONDERFUL. THANK YOU SO MUCH ERIN MY HAND ON BEHALF OF THE HALF A MILLION MEMBERS OF THE STATE BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL OF CALIFORNIA- AS YOU ALL KNOW. THE STATE BUILDING TRADES HAVE BUILT THE VAST MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIA'S RENEWABLE ENERGY. YOU SET THE BAR WORLDWIDE AND WHAT IT MEANS TO BE GREEN AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO PUSH THOSE CALLS. BUT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT A JUST TRANSITION A TERM OF THE BUILDING TRADES THAT- WE- NEED. WHERE AND LITTLE APPREHENSION WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE ANY TRANSITION WHERE OUR WORKERS OUR INDUSTRIAL WORKERS ARE MOVED INTO A PROFESSION IT IS NOT EIGHT INDUSTRIAL TRADE- OUR INTENTION IN OUR FIGHT IS IN MAINTAINING THE JOBS THAT ARE MEMBERS- CURRENTLY HAVE. CURRENTLY LOGGED IN ENABLE THEM TO FEED THEIR FAMILIES. THE JOB SHOULD REMAIN IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN KILL THE STATE IS NO LONGER DEPENDENT ON FOSSIL FUELS. AT THE SAME TIME SIMULTANEOUSLY WE SEE- MOVING OUR MEMBERS INTO NEW TECHNOLOGIES NEW INDUSTRIES LIKE CARBON CAPTURE AND HYDROGEN AND OTHER NEW FUELS THAT ALLOW INDUSTRIAL WORKERS TO REMAIN INDUSTRIAL WORKERS. IT WILL ALLOW THE CHILDREN OF INDUSTRIAL WORKERS TO CHOOSE TO FOLLOW THEIR PARENTS PASSED TO BE INDUSTRIAL WORKERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- WE ARE- WE'D BE REMISS IF WE DIDN'T MENTION. AT NASA AND OTHER POLICIES LIKE NAFTA THAT WERE WELL INTENTIONED BUT HAD DEVASTATING EFFECTS. ON BLUE COLLAR WORKFORCE- CALIFORNIA LOST I THINK OVER HALF A MILLION JOBS AFTER THE PASSAGE OF NAFTA- WE LEARNED A LOT FROM NAFTA THERE WERE SUBSIDIES THE WENT TO PLACE A LOT OF TALK ABOUT JOB RETRAINING- RETRAINING- YOU KNOW. MULTI GENERATIONS OF- MANAGED CALL CENTER. AND THINGS THAT MORE OF THOSE JOBS- THAT- SOME. I WOULD NOT- ANYTHING LIKE THE JOBS THEY HAD BEFORE DISAPPEARED WHEN THE FEDERAL SUBSIDIES THAT. SO WE HAVE THE BENEFIT OF HISTORY HERE- WE HAVE A HUGE BLUE COLLAR WORKFORCE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT IS PROUD. TO BE CALIFORNIA'S BLUE COLLAR WORKFORCE PROUD TO KEEP CALIFORNIA MOVING. AND AT THE STATE BUILDING TRADES WE ARE A INTEND TO KEEP THEM IN THE JOBS THEY HAVE AND TO CREATE ADDITIONAL INDUSTRIAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR OUR MEMBERSHIP. THANK YOU I'M I HAVE JUST ADD A COUPLE QUESTIONS AND THEN I'LL OPEN IT OUT TO OTHER MEMBERS. AT SU. AND ANY OF YOU CAN SPEAK TO THIS OP HOW MANY. WORKERS ARE EMPLOYED ON THE PLATFORMS. ON OFFSHORE OIL PLATFORMS THAT ARE IN STATE WATERS AND HOW MANY WORKERS WERE IMPACTED BY THE DECOMMISSIONING OF HOLIDAY. LISTEN. EIGHT INDIFFERENTLY HOW MANY BUILDING BUILDING TRADES MEMBERS YES. THE BUILDING TRADES AREN'T TRADITIONALLY ON THE PLATFORM- THEY DO SOME WORK- AROUND INSTALLING- PLATFORM FACILITIES- THE I THINK THAT THE MORE TIME CALIFORNIAN NICE JOB BASE YOU WHICH STATE IS IN THE- YOU KNOW ON SHORING OF IT- AND- I THINK TYSON I'M PACING YOU WORKED ON A PLATFORM RIGHT. YES I DID A LOT OF. YEAH CAN YOU GUYS HEAR ME YES YEAH SO LONG OF MADAM IT- I ACTUALLY STARTED MY CAREER SHORTLY AFTER MY BASEBALL CAREER ON PLATFORM HOLY I WAS WORKING FOR THE DRAWING OUT THE COMPANY CALLED THE NIGHT DRAWING WE WERE WORKING FOR MEDICAL WHO WAS THE OPERATOR PLATFORM HOLLY AT THE TIME. DURING MY TENURE BACK IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE FOR TWO YEARS ARE WE EMPLOYED ABOUT FORTY FIVE RATE WORKERS DENTICLE HAD ABOUT FIFTEEN TO TWENTY FULL TIME OPERATIONS AND SALARY EMPLOYEES THAT MANDATE PRODUCED OIL FROM THE REXALL A SUBSTANTIAL JOB LOSS FROM THAT PLATFORM WAS THE COMMISSION. QUESTION I GUESS OUR CONCERN IS- SORRY. NOT SPECIFICALLY I MEAN WE WERE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THAT YOU KNOW THAT THE JOB OF ANY WORKER- THAT IS- YOU KNOW KIND OF BEING LOST BEFORE ITS TIME- I THINK THAT. MOREOVER WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THE GENERAL POLICIES TO STOP- THE DEVELOPMENT OF YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA BASED- ENERGY. YOU KNOW AND THE WAY THAT THIS MIDEAST POLICIES HAVE KIND OF BLED INTO EACH OTHER SO I THINK WELL WHEN. YOU'RE TALKING SPECIFICALLY TODAY MAYBE ABOUT THOSE JOBS THAT WILL BE LOST ON THE PLATFORM'S POTENTIALLY WE ARE ALSO VERY CONCERNED ABOUT HOW THAT POLICY LEADS OVER AND HOW EXISTING- POLICIES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ARE THREATENING THE JOBS OF HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIA. IT'S A WILL AND GAS INDUSTRY- YOU KNOW IS IN A IS IN A POSITION BECAUSE OF POLICIES- WE'RE INVESTMENT- AND YOU KNOW FURTHER INNOVATION IS BEING DISCOURAGED. BECAUSE OF LEGISLATIVE POLICIES. AND I WOULD WOULD SAY I MEAN I AND I DON'T THINK I'M ALONE IN THIS VIEW- YOU KNOW CERTAINLY MICHAEL AS A POLICYMAKERS TO ENSURE THAT. AS WE ARE TRANSITIONING CALIFORNIA TO CLEANER AND GREENER SOURCES OF ENERGY WE DO SO IN A WAY THAT BOTH MAINTAINS OUR ENERGY INDEPENDENCE AND ALSO. INVEST IN THESE NEW TECHNOLOGIES WHICH OPEN NEW WINDOWS OF OPPORTUNITY ASK FOR OUR EXISTING WORKFORCE AND FOR THE WITH THE WORKFORCE OF THE FUTURE- BUT I ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT THAT IS A- VERY BIG AND LOFTY GOAL. AND THAT WE NEED DETAILS PLANS AND IN ORDER TO ACTUALLY MAKE PROGRESS TOWARDS THAT GOAL AND- WE KNOW THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO ACHIEVE THAT. AT TRANSITION. IN A RESPONSIBLE WAY WITHOUT. PLANNING FOR IT- AND SO YOU KNOW IN MY VIEW THAT IS WHY IT'S SO CRITICAL FOR US. TO ALL BE ENGAGED IN THIS CONVERSATION RIGHT NOW SO THAT WE CAN ENSURE THAT WE'RE MAKING THE RIGHT INVESTMENTS RIGHT NOW AND THAT WE UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT PATH LOOKS LIKE- YEP RATHER THAN JUST LET IT SNEAK UP ON ICE AND I FIND OURSELVES IN A POSITION WHERE. YOU HAVE MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS ARE SCREWED OVER AS A RESULT I'M SO MUCH ONE OF- FOLLOWING THAT SAME LINE OF- OF CONVERSATION I WANT TO THANK AARON ALSO TIM AND ALSO TYSON- FOR YOUR TESTIMONIES HERE TO DAY OUT- CERTAINLY ARE RIGHT HERE YOU SEE A SUPPORT YOU I THINK WE REALLY HAVE TO HAVE I JUST WANT THIS IS TALKING ABOUT DECOMMISSIONING- ABANDONED WELLS- AND I THINK THAT'S ABOUT WHERE I WAS TALK TO MY COLLEAGUE MISTER BLOOM THAT THAT WELL THAT YES LIFE IS INDEED. AND SO IN A RESPONSIBLE WAY THAT DOESN'T- CAUSES THE ENVIRONMENT TO BE EXPOSED- THE SITUATION IT TOOK PLACE YOU KNOW AND ORANGECOUNTY AREASOFF THE OFF OUR SHORES HERE HOPEFULLY WE PUT A PLAN IN PLACE THAT THAT IS NOT WRITTEN THAT IT IS PUT MEASURES IN PLACE THAT SOMETHING LIKE THIS CAN NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN MOVING FORWARD AT THE SAME TIME I AM VERY MINDFUL. OF THE STATE. WHERE YOU KNOW WE'RE TRYING TO PHASE OUT FOSSIL FUEL AND TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT IS DONE IN A- RESPONSIBLE- AND THOUGHTFUL WAY. I'M ALSO REMINDED OF A QUOTE FROM A GENTLEMAN WHO I SERVE WITH- HE SAID DO YOU WANT TO SAVE THE CHERY- THE PERSON UNDER THE TREE. LET ME SAY THAT AGAIN DO WE SAVE THE SRI OF THE PERSON UNDER THE TREE AND I MEAN NO DISRESPECT ANYONE. IS JUST SOMETHING THAT I HAVE TO COME TO GRIPS WITH BASED ON. WHERE I REPRESENT. I REPRESENT PEOPLE. AND THOSE PEOPLE NEED TO HAVE JOBS THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF THEIR FAMILIES- AND THEN THOSE WHO ARE IN PRISON WHO ARE GETTING OUT OF PRISON. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR STREETS ARE SAFE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE THOSE INDIVIDUALS HAVE A SECOND CHANCE ON LIFE. AND SOME COMPANIES AND SOME FLOORS ONE EMPLOYEE EMPLOYER EMPLOYEE THEM BECAUSE OF THEIR PASS IT IS REGRETTABLE AND WE TRY TO MAKE POLICIES. SO THAT THOSE INDIVIDUALS WON'T BE DISCRIMINATED ON THAT PASSED THE BIGGER RIGHT A NEW NARRATIVE MOVING FORWARD. AND WE HAVE TO LOOK AT YOU KNOW THIS CONVERSATION A VERY THOUGHTFUL MANNER- AGAIN THE END OF LIFE WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO THESE OIL WELLS. THE OIL WELLS IS NOT PRODUCING IT'S AWAIT THE DECOMMISSIONING. POURING THE CEMENT OF CONCRETE WHATEVER YOU WANNA CALL IT BECAUSE IT'S OUT OF COMMISSION. BUT WE ALSO MOVING FORWARD HAVE TO REALIZE THAT THOSE INDIVIDUALS THAT I ONCE WORKED THERE NEED TO FIND WORK. AND TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT. PEOPLE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO GET A JOB TO SUSTAIN THEMSELVES MOVING FORWARD. AND SO AS I JUST CONCLUDE BY SIMPLY SAYING THAT. AS WE HAVE POLICY DISCUSSIONS AND DEBATES BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE DO. THAT'S ALL RISK OUR RESPONSIBILITY DEBATE AND MAKE IT INTO DECISION. THAT WE SHOULD MAKE A DECISION BY KEEP IN MIND OF THE PEOPLE THAT WE SERVE AND THE PEOPLE WHO EVEN WE DON'T SERVE. BUT PEOPLE WHO WANT PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE CLOTHES. ON THAT USES BACK IN YOU KNOW COMMUNITIES WHETHER SAFE AND I BELIEVE IF YOU GIVE A MAN A WOMAN A JOB WHICH HAS BEEN. ILLUSTRATED BY THE TESTIMONY. EITHER OF- TÌM OR TYSON I GETTING CONFUSED AS WELL AS A FORMER BASEBALL PLAYER AND THE OTHER WASN'T BUT NONE THE LESS ROOM. CHANGING THEIR LIVES BY GETTING A JOB. FATHER WILL EASE IN A HOME BOY BAKER TO GIVE A MAN A WOMAN A JOB. USE YOU STOP A BULLET. I NEED TO STOP OPEN BOTH MY COMMUNITY. I NEED TO STOP THE VIOLENCE THAT ARE TAKING PLACE AND I'LL BE INTERESTING HIS JOB IS NOT THE ANSWER THE ART OF THE AUNT TO ANSWER ALL THE PROBLEMS BUT IT'S OPPORTUNITY FOR SOMEONE RIGHT NEW NARRATIVE FOR THEM FOR THEMSELVES AND CHANGE THEIR THINKING. AND SO AS WE HAVE THIS THOUGHTFUL DISCUSSION THAT WE SHOULD DEBATE IT TRULY BUT HAVE A THOUGHTFUL DISCUSSION BY CREATING A ALANCE. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER PLAN I'LL BE QUICK AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS FROM MY- FRIEND FROM CARSON- BUT I DO WANT TO POINT OUT- I LIKE THE ANALOGY OF YOU KNOW THE TREE VERSUS THE PERSON UNDER THE TREE HOWEVER- OUR DECISION MAKING IN THIS REGARD IT IT'S NOT BINARY IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE BINARY WE HAVE TO STE WE HAVE TO. SAVE THE TREE AND THE PERSON UNDER THE TREE AND THAT'S REALLY- WHAT THE GREAT CHALLENGES- IN ENVIRONMENTALISM AND UNDERSTAND THE ECO SYSTEMS- YOU KNOW YOU. YOU'RE YOU'RE NOT SAVING A HUMAN IF YOU DON'T SAVE THE TREES CORRECT WE NEED EVERYTHING- TO BE PRESERVED IT'S HARD WORK- AND EVER EVER EVERYTHING YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT I THINK IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER BRIAN. YEAH I DON'T WANNA KEEP BEATING THE TREE ANALOGY BUT THERE THERE'S SOME FOLKS IN THE HE DOES IT'S IN MY COMMUNITY THAT WOULD GIVE SOME TREES- WHAT I REALLY WANNA APPRECIATE. OF THE BUILDING TRADES COMING TODAY BECAUSE YOU KNOW I COME FROM THE SCHOOL OF THOUGHT NOTHING ABOUT US WITHOUT US. AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO MOVE THE BUILDING TRADES THE IDEA THAT SOMEBODY'S TRAINED. TO BE INDUSTRIAL WANTS TO WORK. IN THE FIELD AT THE WORKING AND I UNDERSTAND THAT WE ALL CHOSE. THIS OCCUPATION FOR THE VERY SAME REASON YOU TAKE PRIDE IN WHAT YOU DO YOU FIND FULFILLMENT IN IN THE FACT THAT YOU CAN FEED YOUR FAMILIES. IS SOMETHING NOT TO BE. NEGATED I WOULD LOVE FIRST TO SEE THIS CONVERSATION MOVED FROM. KINDOF AN ADVERSARIAL TABLE TO TALK TO ONE OF INCLUSION- AND I WANT TO THANK THE BUILDING TRADES FOR HAVING BEEN A PART OF THAT. INCLUDES OF CONVERSATION TO THIS POINT WE WOULDN'T BE A LEADER ON CLIMATE CHANGE IF IT WASN'T FOR. THE PEOPLE IN THE WORKING INDUSTRY THAT HAVE MADE. THE JUST TRANSITION IN A NUMBER OF SECTORS ALREADY. AND SO AS WE CONTINUE TO MOVE IN INNOVATION. I GUESS MY QUESTION. BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO JUST SIT UP HERE AND PONTIFICATE. ABOUT MY QUESTION FOR THE BUILDING TRADES AS WE CONTINUE TO BUILD THESE TABLES OF CONVERSATION OF HOW TO MOVE FORWARD TOGETHER. MAKE SURE FOLKS CONTINUE TO GET PAID TO MAKE SURE THAT WE INNOVATE. IS THAT A TABLE OF THE TO BE WILLING TO SIT AT BECAUSE I'VE GOT. MULTIPLE SEATS FOR YOU IF pPANELISTS ERIN STILL THERE I WILL IT WILL BE THERE OKAY WILL BE THERE. I THANK YOU FOR THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER WE HAVE A WE HAVE WE HAVE BEEN SAVING THE TREE AND THE PERSON AS WE FELT THAT ALL THE SOLAR AND WIND FIELD- WE'RE UP TO DEATH AT THE STATE OF MIND THAT WE CAN DO BOTH BECAUSE WE HAVE- BEEN DOING BOTH. SIDES I APPRECIATE- MISTER GIBSON'S ANALOGY. THE BY MAY THIRTY SOMETHING YES PLEASE. THIS IS TYSON BAGI JUST GOT ASSEMBLYMEMBER GIPSON. THANK YOU FOR THE COMMENTS ARE MET YOU SOMETIME AGO. IN SACRAMENTO BOB I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENT. SOMETHING I HOPE YOU GUYS UNDERSTAND TOO AS I KNOW WE'RE DISCUSSING. THE PLATFORMS BUT I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND THE MULTIPLIERS THAT AFFECT THOSE PLATFORMS. WE TAKE OUT OIL PRODUCING PLATFORMS OR DRILLING WELLS IN CALIFORNIA. WE TAKE OUT THE REFINERIES IN THE QUAKE IN THE EQUATION. A LIVING EXAMPLE RIGHT NOW AS WE SPEAK. I HAVE OVER SEVENTY FIVE MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS IN THE SKILLED WORKERS. IN OVER A HUNDRED IN THE BUILDING TRADES AFFECTED BY ANIMAL THE REFINERY PLANT CLOSURE. THAT RELY ON THE EXXONMOBIL. OFF PLATFORM. TO SUPPLY ITS TRUE OR- PEOPLE GONE THOSE JOBS ARE GONE BOTH LIVING CAREERS THAT THEY HAD. FOR THE LAST TWENTY TO THIRTY YEARS IS NOW OVER LOOKING FOR WAYS TO TRANSFER TO OTHER FACILITIES WHEN THEY HAD A GOOD WORKING FACILITY THERE. BUT THE LEGISLATOR FAILED FAILED TO HELP RESTORE THAT PIPELINE TO GET CRUDE FLOWING TO THAT FACILITY WHICH IMPACTED NOT ONLY CALIFORNIA JOBS. WHAT IMPACT THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENT DUE TO TRANSFERRING AND THE OVER FOOD PRODUCTION MAKE UP THAT WE HAD. ON THANK YOU AND TO ADD. ASSEMBLY MEMBER WITH THANK YOU- THIS QUESTION COULD IT COULD BE FOR AARON TYSON ATTEMPT SO WE'VE BEEN HEARING A LOT ABOUT TRANSITION AND HOW IT LOOKS LIKE BUT FROM I WANT TO HEAR FROM YOU WHETHER IT BE JOB RETAINING OR GUARANTEED INCOME HOW DOES IT LOOK LIKE FOR YOUR WORKFORCE. ERIN IF I MAY START OFF ON THAT PLEASE- I'D LIKE TO. ANSWER THAT QUESTION SO I'VE I'VE HEARD THAT TERM A LOT RIGHT JUST TRANSITION NOT INTERESTED IN HERE TO SKILLED WORKERS LOCAL THREE TWENTY SIX IS A CORPORATE WELFARE PROGRAM. WE HAVE ABLE BODIED WILLING PEOPLE TO WORK. I WANT TO SHOW YOU GUYS I HOPE THAT YOU DO SOME RESEARCH AFTER THIS TO LOOK AT THE RODEO RENEW PROJECT HERE FOR PHILLIPS SIXTY SIX. WERE ACTUALLY INVESTING THE COMPANY IS INVESTING ONE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN THIS CURRENT FACILITY. THAT ALL EMPLOYEES ARE CURRENTLYFULL TIME WORKFORCE BUT OVER FIFTEEN HUNDRED TRADESMEN AND WOMEN TO COME IN THERE AND BUILD THIS STATE OF THE ART FACILITY. THAT IS AN EXAMPLE OF TRUST JUST TRANSITION MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS OUT OF LOCAL FIVE U. S. W. AT THE MARATHON MARTINEZ REFINERY. DID NOT GET TO EXPERIENCE THAT. THEY HAD OVER A CONVERSION OF RENEWABLE FACILITY PHILLIPS SIXTY SIX HAS BEEN A CLASS ACT AND THROWN HIM. AND I ONLY KEEP THE CURRENT WORKFORCE BUT EXPAND IT. AND KEEP OUR ENERGY JOBS ARE HELPING CALIFORNIA TRANSITION AND OBTAIN THE AGGRESSIVE. QUALITY GOALS SET BY GOVERNOR NEWSOM. AND YES I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR HIGH. THAT EXAMPLE- ALSO YOUR COMMENTS YOU S. TO. AS MANY THE NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND EMERGING. INDUSTRIES INCLUDING AND HYDROGEN AND CARBON CAPTURE WHERE THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES FOR US TO NOT JUST RETAIN THE JOBS THAT WE HAVE THAT CREATE MORE AND BETTER JOBS- AND SO I THINK IT'S VERY VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE- ALL CONTINUE. NOT IN NOT IN THAT CONVERSATION AND SURE THAT WE ARE MAKING THE RIGHT INCENTIVE AT MAKING RIGHT INVESTMENTS IN THE RIGHT POLICY DECISIONS IN ORDER TO INCENTIVIZE THAT ACT KIND OF GROWTH INNOVATION. AND OPPORTUNITY IN CALIFORNIA- WITH THAT THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT AND WE'VE HAD TO SORRY WE HAD TO FIGHT- THE SAME ACTIVISTS- THAT ARE YOU KNOW. HAMMERING THE EXISTING ENERGY INDUSTRY TO ENTITLE OF THE SOLAR FIELDS AND WIND FARMS AND WE'RE FINDING THE SAME THING AS WE MOVE FORWARD WITH OFFSHORE WIND YOU KNOW THE GREAT. HORIZON FOR ADDITIONAL GREEN- POWER TO BE BROUGHT INTO ON SHORE AND TO CALIFORNIA BUT WE HAVE WE ARE SPENDING SO MUCH OF OUR TIME COLLECTIVELY TRYING TO FIGHT TO BRING ADDITIONAL GREEN POWER ON TO BRING CLEAN FUEL TO MARKET. DID YOU ALL OF THE THINGS WILL CREATE ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR OUR COLLECTIVE MEMBERSHIP. SO AS FAR AS LIKE THE LEGISLATURE LOOKING FOR WAYS TO HELP THIS INDUSTRIAL- WORKFORCE TO CONTINUE TO DO WHAT THEY DO. AND HIS WORK IT'S THE LISTING UP THOSE OPPORTUNITIES IT'S LOOKING AT WAYS THAT WE CAN STREAMLINED I THINK TYSON TOUCHED ON THAT IN THE BEGINNING. THE AMOUNT OF RED TAPE THERE IS TO DO THE THINGS THAT ACTUALLY MOVE THAT THE AGENDA IN CALIFORNIA FORWARD LIKE LET'S THINK OF WAYS THAT WE CAN COLLECTIVELY. THREE MINUTE THOSE OPPORTUNITIES BOTH TO MAKE CALIFORNIA A GREENER PLACE AND ALSO TO CREATE INDUSTRIAL JOB OPPORTUNITIES FOR OURMEMBERS AND THE NEXT GENERATION OF KIDS THAT YOU KNOW THE CAMPS OUT THERE RECRUITING ON A DAILY BASIS FROM THE MILITARY- YOU KNOW RECENTLY INCARCERATED- KIDS FROM THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THE BUILDING TRADES TO THAT'S WHICH CAN DOES. ALL DAY EVERY DAY. THANK YOU. WILL PROBABLY NOT I DO BELIEVE I THEIR OWN. CON LET IN THE S. OF A HUNDRED TWENTY MEMBERS. ONLY A HANDFUL OF US THAT ACTUALLY SIGNED A FRONT OF A CHECK IN EMPLOYED PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THE POLICIES DO IN THE STATE TO KILL A BUSINESS. BECAUSE I CLOSE MINE IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN BECAUSE OF THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD. WE'RE GOING AFTER THE OIL INDUSTRY PART OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET RIGHT HERE'S TO PHASE OUT THE OIL INDUSTRY. THEY'RE GOING AFTER YOUR JOBS AND THEN WE SIT HERE TALK ABOUT JOBS THAT WE WANT TO CREATE A CALIFORNIA. AND WE WANT TO BE PUBLIC SAFETY. BUT WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THAT THE FUNDING OF THE COPS WE CAN'T HAVE IT BOTH WAYS FOLKS. WE NEED TO KEEP THEIR JOBS IN CALIFORNIA IT QUIT GOING AFTER THE INDUSTRIES. TO CREATE THOSE JOBS IF THE OIL INDUSTRY THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY THE FOREST INDUSTRY. THE AUTO INDUSTRY. WE CREATE POLICIES THAT ARE HAMMERING THESE BUSINESSES. THEY LEAVE THE STATE. OIL INDUSTRY'S GOING TO LOUISIANA GOING TO TEXAS GOING TO THE EAST COAST. AND WE IMPORTED OIL. WE DON'T CUT DOWN THE FORCED TO CREATE OUR LUMBER FOR THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY BUT IT BURNS UP IN THIS STATE BY MILLIONS OF ACRES EVERY YEAR. I CAN RAIL AND I CAN RAIL BUT WE HAVE TO GET BACK INTO THE POLICIES THAT CREATE JOBS IN CALIFORNIA. NOT KILL JOBS IN CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU AND I MISS DAVIES THANK YOU APPRECIATE IT- QUICK QUESTION- ERIN A NUMBER OF UNIONS AND TRADE GROUPS SIGNED ON AND DEVELOP THE A CALIFORNIA CLIMATE JOB PLANS WHICH PREVIEWED SOME OF THE POLICIES- NEEDS FOR POTENTIAL TRANSITION AWAY FROM FOSSIL FUEL JOBS. HOWEVER THE BUILDING TRADES DID NOT SIGN ON I'M CURIOUS WHY WAS THAT AND WHAT PLAN LACKED OR IS MISSING THAT WE ARE NOT CONSIDERING WHEN IT COMES TO OUR WORKFORCE IMPACT. I JUST WANNA MAKE A GROUP QUICK POINTS WERE TALKING ABOUT THE TREE IN THE PERSON OR THE TREE. WE TALK ABOUT STOPPING TAKING THESE JOBS AWAY BY TRANSITIONING TO OTHERS WELL IF YOU LOOK AT COVERT RIGHT NOW WE'VE GOT SO MANY JOB OPENINGS RIGHT NOW UP AND YET WE'VE GOT PEOPLE ON UNEMPLOYMENT BECAUSE THESE AREN'T THE JOBS THEY WANT SO. JUST CONSIDERING THAT WE'RE GONNA TAKE THESE JOBS AWAY BUT YOU'RE GOING TO WANT THIS JOB ISN'T EXACTLY TRUE. AND SO I THINK THAT AGAIN WE NEED TO REALIZE THIS IS WHAT THEY TRAIN FOR THIS IS WHAT THEY WANT TO DO AND TO TAKE THIS WAY THING NOW OR HERE YOU GO YOU'RE NOT GONNA BECOME THIS. IS JUST NOT REALISTIC AGAIN WE'RE WATCHING THIS BUT CALL BUT PEOPLE ARE NOT GOING BACK TO WORK TO CERTAIN JOBS THAT THEY HAD OR JOBS THAT ARE OPENING THEIR THEY DON'T WANT THOSE JOBS EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE UNEMPLOYED AT THIS POINT. YOU'RE IN IF YOU DON'T MIND- RESPONDING TO THAT QUESTION I APPRECIATE IT. SURE I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF FALLACY. YOU KNOW JOB RETRAINING. THIS NOTION OF THE JOB RETRAINING- AND YOU KNOW. THAT WE CAN IF THERE'S A KIND OF A- PROBLEM THAT MONEY CAN SOLVE. AS FAR AS- IF YOU'LL JUST RETRAIN FOLKS THEY WILL TAKE THOSE JOBS. AND AGAIN IT GOES BACK TO IT YOU KNOW. AT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THAT I REALLY- RESPECT MOST ABOUT THE- THAT MEN AND WOMEN. THAT WE REPRESENT IS THE PRIDE THEY TAKE IN THEIR WORK- JUST LIKE I ASSUME ALL OF YOU DO- YOU KNOW. GROWING UP THIS WAS- THIS WAS THE END GAME. FOR THE MEN AND WOMEN IT WASN'T A DEFAULT PROFESSION IT WAS A TRADE THAT. THAT TOOK. YEARS FOR THEM TO MASTER- THEY GO TO. THEIR APPRENTICE PROGRAM- WAS MUCH HARDER. THAN MY YOU KNOW COLLEGE AND LAW SCHOOL EDUCATION I COULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED MAYBE I COULD'VE BUT- I COULD. ACT A LOT OF. THE TRAINING THAT THESE GUYS GO THROUGH IT IS. DAY AND NIGHT. THEY WORK AND THEY GO TO SCHOOL FULL TIME AT THE SAME TIME IT IS AN INTENTIONAL PROFESSION- AND THEY DON'T WANT. TO DO. SO I THINK. THAT AND MISSED YOU KNOW UNQUOTE JOSH. AND THEN LET'S TALK ABOUT JOB REACH FOR. IS IT SOME A CO OF SAN. THAT THAT YOU KNOW THESE GUYS WHEN I SAY GUYS IT'S NOT A WAY WILL TAKE. YOU KNOW WHATEVER IS. TO THEM. WELL THAT'S THAT'S JUST NOT TRUE THEY WANT TO DO WITH JOB. THEY WERE TRAINED TO DO AND WANT TO DO THAT. THAT THEY'RE PROUD TO DO AND WHEN YOU KNOW. THERE'S EIGHT HI WITHIN THE BUILDING TRADES BECAUSE EVERY SINGLE ONE OF OUR MEMBERS GOES HOME AT THE END OF THE DAY ARE GOES HOME AT THE END OF SHIPS AND THEY'RE TIRED. AND DIRTY BUT THEY HAVE BUILT SOMETHING THEY HAVE MADE IT SOMETHING. AND THE SENSE OF CRIED THEY GET FROM THAT IS NOTHING THAT YOU CAN YOU KNOW BE TRAINED THEM TO DO- THIS IS THEIR CHOSEN PROFESSION THIS IS WHO THEY ARE AND THAT'S HOW THEY IDENTIFY THEMSELVES. AND I THINK AS WE GO FORWARD IT'S IMPORTANT TO GIVE. YOU KNOW THE RISKS BACK. OF WHAT A TRADE MEANS TO ANOTHER PERSON AND YOU KNOW THAT'S WHY WE WERE NOT INTERESTED COLLECTIVELY IN THIS SENSE OF YOU KNOW THAT'S GOING TO PRODUCE JEFF TRANSITION. BECAUSE YOU KNOW OUR GUYS ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO DO THE TRADE BUT THEY WEREN'T THEY INTENDED TO DO THAT THEY WORK TO DO THAT THEY TRAINED TO DO AND THAT THEY DO DAY IN AND DAY OUT. AND THAT'S HOW THEY SUPPORT THEIR FAMILY. THANK YOU AND WITH THAT SAID HOW CAN WE AS LEGISLATORS SUPPORT OUR WORKERS BY CREATING. NEW OPPORTUNITIES IN THE TRADES. ABOUT THREE. LET'S GET THESE NEW PROCESS BELT. BUT GET CARBON CAP GOING LET'S GET. ONLINE LET'S GET NEW FUEL ONLINE. LET'S BUILD A SURE WE- I CAN ON. ALL DAY. I'M A WE DO WE GO BACK TO GOING BACK TO MISTER GIBSON REDUCING THEM. THE PERSON UNDER THE AND YOU SAY THAT YOU. WE HAVE SO MUCH WE CAN DO A COLLECTIVE. IT WILL RAISE THE BY AND WE'RE JUST DO THAT AND IT'S MISSION CREDIT TIME WE ARE UP TO. IT THERE'S- URGENCY- THIS STATE DOES NOT HAVE THE TRANSMISSION- YOU KNOW IT DOES NOT HAVE THE POWER PRODUCTION NECESSARY TO SUPPORT. THE THE GOALS THAT WE SET FOR THE STATE I MEAN WE NEED TO GET GOING YESTERDAY. SO STREAMLINING AS THE WAY TO DO IT WE NEED TO GET THESE NEW FACILITIES ONLINE. AND WE NEED TO GET OUR MEMBERS WORKING ON THESE NEW FACILITIES. THANK YOU AND THANK YOU ALL FOR WHAT YOU DO. THANK YOU. AND YET THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS THE HEY I AND MISTER JEFFRIES MR AT BANK FOR JOINING US TODAY. OBVIOUSLY YOU USE IT BEST WE NEED GET MOVING YESTERDAY ON. ON OF THAT SAID FOR TO CAN. OUR THAT CONVERSE. AND HAVE WITH THAT. WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO OUR LAST PANEL WE ALREADY DID THAT WE SORT OF. TOUCHED ON THE AT PLATFORM HOLLY. IN PREVIOUS DISCUSSIONS WERE GONNA SKIP THAT AND AB MOVE TO OUR FINAL PANEL. WHICH IS AT RIGS TO REEFS A VIABLE STRATEGY FOR CALIFORNIA- AND WE ARE PLEASED TO WELCOME AMBER SPARKS FROM THE BLUE LATITUDES FOUNDATION. AND I THINK WE'LL ALSO BE BRINGING BACK MISS CROSS I THINK TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. ALONG WITH THAT MISS PARKS. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US. THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY. SO I DO HAVE A PRESENTATION IF YOU COULD GO TO THE FIRST FIVE. SHE THOUGHT. GOOD AFTERNOON EVERYONE THANK YOU FOR PUTTING TOGETHER THIS HEARING IS AN HONOR TO BE HERE TODAY MY NAME IS AMBER SPARKS I AM A MARINE CONSERVATION BIOLOGIST AND CO PRESIDENT ON THE BLUE LATITUDES FOUNDATION OR FIVE OH ONE C. THREE NON PROFIT THAT WORKS ON CONSERVATION ISSUES AT THE INTERSECTION OF INDUSTRY AND THE ENVIRONMENT. I'M ALSO A CO FOUNDER OF BLUE LATITUDES LOC A FEDERAL FEDERALLY CERTIFIED WOMEN OWNED MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL CONSULTING FIRM. THAT'S BEEN WORKING FOR THE PAST. TEN YEARS ON. LAKE STREET CONVERSION PROCESS- PROJECTS AROUND THE WORLD DOING ECOLOGICAL VALUE ASSESSMENTS IN THE GULF OF MEXICO THAILAND MALAYSIA SO I'M EXCITED TO BE HERE TODAY AND SHARE SOME OF MY EXPERTISE NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. MY INTEREST IN RIGS AS REEFS REALLY BEGAN IN GRADUATE SCHOOL WHERE I WAS A- SETTING THESE PLATFORMS. AND BEING ADVISED BY DR MILTON LOVE OCEANOGRAPHY. WE WERE LOOKING AT THESE PLATFORMS WHICH FROM ONE SPEECH SHARE REALLY LOOK LIKE INDUSTRIAL MENACING GIANTS BUT WHEN YOU GO BELOW THE SURFACE THERE IS SO MUCH MORE AND AS PRODUCTION IS COMING TO AN END WE REALLY NEED TO ASK THE QUESTION NEXT SLIDE. OF WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE OIL WELLS DRY UP. NEXT SLIDE. ENTER THIS ENGINEERING FEAT OF A LIFETIME HOW TO REMOVE THE STRUCTURE SOME THE SIZE OF THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING FROM THE SEA FLOOR. AS WE'VE HEARD FROM PREVIOUS PRESENTATIONS TODAY THIS PROCESS OF DECOMMISSIONING CAN BE VERY TECHNICALLY COMPLEX AND HAVE SOME SIGNIFICANT ENVIRONMENTAL CHALLENGES AS WELL NEXT SLIDE. SPECIALLY WHEN WE CONSIDER THAT BELOW THE SURFACE EVERY BEAM AND CROSSBEAM OF CALIFORNIANS PLATFORMS ARE COVERED IN MARINE LIFE WE SKI SEA SCALLOPS AND ENEMIES. SCHOOLS OF JACK MACKEREL NEXT SLIDE. WE EVEN SEE SOME OF OUR STATE SALTWATER FISH THAT GARIBALDI THAT NASA MAKE THEIR PERMANENT HOME ON THESE OFFSHORE STRUCTURES. NEXT SLIDE. RIGS TO REEF PROVIDES AN ALTERNATIVE TO COMPLETELY REMOVING THE POP FROM JACKET FROM THE WATERCOLUMN IN WHICH THE STRUCTURE IS MODIFIED SO THAT IT CAN CONTINUE TO FUNCTION AS AN ARTIFICIAL REEF. DIRECTORY OF CONVERSION THE WELL IS GOING TO BE SEALED AND CAPPED AND THE OIL COMPANIES WILL RETAIN LIABILITY FOR THAT WELL IN PERPETUITY BUT THE PLATFORM JACKET WHICH TO MEET COAST GUARD REGULATIONS WOULD BE CUT DOWN EIGHTY FIVE FEET BELOW THE WATER SURFACE TO ALLOW FOR SHIPS TO SAFELY DROPPED OVER. AND NOT REMAINING PLATFORM JACKET WOULD REMAIN IN THE WATER COLUMN TO FUNCTION AS AN ARTIFICIAL REEF BACKSIDE. BUT BEFORE WE GET TOO FAR AHEAD OF OURSELVES WHAT REALLY IS AN ARTIFICIAL REEF. YOU CAN'T JUST SAY EVERYTHING WE PUT IN THE OCEAN IS GOING TO MAKE FOR. GOOD HABITAT NEXT SLIDE RESEARCHERS HAVE PLACED RE FALLS ON THE SEA FLOOR TO LOOK AT HOW MARINE LIFE COLONIZES AND THEY- LOOK AT COLONIZATION RATES AND USE A SAYS THE STUDY POINT NEXT LINE. ARTISTS EVEN HAVE THEIR OWN TAKE BY. LOOKING AT HOW THEIR INSTALLATIONS ON THE SEA FLOOR CAN BE ENHANCED BY. THE DEVELOPMENT OF MARINE LIFE NEXT SLIDE. BUT WHAT MAKES AN OIL PLATFORM A GOOD CANDIDATE FOR AN ARTIFICIAL REEF NOW THIS SICK REALLY LIES IN THE STRUCTURE ITSELF FROM SEA FLOOR TO SEE SERVICE YOU HAVE A LOT OF REAL ESTATE. AND COMPLEXITY WITH THE STRUCTURES BEAMS AND CROSS BEAMS THAT ATTRACT MARINE LIFE THESE PLATFORMS HAVE BEEN STUDIED HERE IN CALIFORNIA FOR OVER THIRTY YEARS AND HAVE BEEN FOUND TO BE AT SOME OF THE MOST PRODUCTIVE MARINE HABITATS ON THE PLANET. NEXT SLIDE. BUT CALIFORNIA IS NOT THE ONLY PLACE WHERE THEY'RE OFF THROWINGGAS PLATFORMS NEXT SLIDE. AND SO I'D LIKE TO SHOW A QUICK. VIDEO OF RICK'S REEF PROGRAMS AROUND THE WORLD HERE SEE A MAP OF THE GLOBE IN THE RED AND- THE RED AND BLUE REPRESENTS OIL AND GAS FIELDS. AS YOU CAN SEE THE FIELDS ARE HIGHLY CONCENTRATED ALONG THE SHORELINE AND OFFSHORE. IN FACT IN EVERY OCEAN UP WE ARE EXTRACTING OIL AND GAS RESERVES. SO WITH THIS INTERNATIONAL REACH YOU WOULD THINK THAT DECOMMISSIONING ALTERNATIVES ARE DECOMMISSIONING DISCUSSIONS WOULD BE DISCUSSED ON AN INTERNATIONAL STAGE BUT THIS IS NOT THE CASE THERE ONLY A FEW PLACES THAT HAVE. RICK'S REEF ALTERNATIVE SOMEONE TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT SOME OF THOSE PROGRAMS THAT ARE WELL ESTABLISHED AS WELL AS THOSE THOSE THAT ARE JUST BEGINNING TO DEVELOP. FIRST WE'LL TAKE A LOOK AT CALIFORNIA WHERE BACK IN TWO THOUSAND TEN FORMER GOVERNOR SCHWARZENEGGER SIGNED IN AB TWENTY FIVE OH THREE. THE MARINE RESOURCE LEGACY ACT WHICH PERMITS- DECOMMISSIONING OF OUR PLATFORMS AS POTENTIAL REEFS. HOWEVER DUE TO SOME OF THE LEGISLATIVE ISSUES WITHIN THE LAW IT DOESN'T INCENTIVIZE THE OIL COMPANIES FOR THE STATE TO REALLY PARTICIPATE MANY OF THESE ISSUES ARE WITH THE LIABILITY ASSOCIATED WITH THE POP FROM JACKET ITSELF. SO SINCE ITS SIGNING IN TWO THOUSAND TEN NONE OF OUR PLATFORMS HAVE BEEN BRIEFED. NOW THIS STANDS IN STARK CONTRAST TO THE GULF OF MEXICO WHERE THE STATES OF. LOUISIANA AND TEXAS HAVE BEEN REAPING THEIR PLATFORMS FOR OVER THIRTY YEARS THEY HAVE SOMEWHERE BETWEEN. FIVE HUNDRED AND SIX HUNDRED PLATFORMS THAT ARE CURRENTLY FUNCTIONING AS SUCCESSFUL ARTIFICIAL REEFS AND MANAGED BY THE STATE'S THEIR- IN THE STATE'S DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE. NOW WILL HEAD OVER TO SOUTHEAST ASIA AND TAKE A LOOK AT PER NIGHT WHICH HAS REPURPOSE A STRUCTURE FOR ECO TOURISM THEY RETROFITTED THE TOP SIDE SO THAT GUESTS COULD COME AND STAY THERE AND THEN DIVE IN THE PLOT FROM JACK IN THE SURROUNDING REEF THIS IS A POTENTIAL RE PURPOSING IDEA THAT HAS WORKED TO GENERATE. MONEY FOR THE LOCAL ECONOMY HERE OFF THE COAST OF FOR NINE. OTHER AREAS IN THE SOUTH CHINA SEA INCLUDING THE GULF OF THAILAND HAVE BEGUN TO DEVELOP. THEIR OWN RIGS TO REEF PROGRAMS OVER THE PAST TEN YEARS THEY'VE BEEN RESEARCHING. HOW TO. MAKE A SUCCESSFUL ROOFING PROGRAM WHICH INCLUDED DISCUSSING THESE PROGRAMS WITH MULTIPLE STAKEHOLDERS FISHING STAKEHOLDERS REGULATORY STAKEHOLDERS AND- THE GULF OF THAILAND HAS JUST PASSED THEIR FIRST. RETHINK CANDIDATE. OUR LAST STOP WILL BE OFF THE COAST OF AFRICA IN THE BONE WHERE DR NICK SALA AND NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC EXPLORER WENT AND BUILT ON THESE PLATFORMS WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT WHILE TRAWLING HAD DECIMATING THE FISHING POPULATIONS IN THE SURROUNDING AREA. THESE PLATFORMS WERE HOT SPOTS FOR LIFE AND HIS RESEARCH GOT THESE PLATFORMS INCORPORATED INTO AFRICA'S LARGEST MARINE PARK. NEXT SLIDE. NOW I WANT TO DO A QUICK OVERVIEW OF SOME OF THE PROS AND CONS OF THIS PROGRAM NEXT SLIDE. NEXT SLIDE. FIRST CON WE SEE. AS A LACK OF GLOBAL LEGISLATION FOR A WHILE. EVERY STREET PROGRAM IN THE GULF OF MEXICO MIGHT BE SUCCESSFUL FOR THE STATE OF TEXAS AND LOUISIANA WE NEED TO LOOK AT HOW THE PROGRAM WOULD BE SUCCESSFUL IN CALIFORNIA AND REALLY. ADDRESS OUR STAKEHOLDER NEEDS AND PREFERENCES TO HAVE A SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM. NEXT SLIDE. INVASIVE SPECIES IS ANOTHER CONCERN THIS PHOTO WAS TAKEN. ON A DIVE ON THE PLOT FROM THE GULF OF MEXICO THAT'S A LINE FISH WHICH IS INVASIVE. THERE HAVE BEEN FOUND TO BE INVASIVE SPECIES ON CALIFORNIA'S PLATFORMS AND THEY'VE DONE SOME RESEARCH ON THIS IN THE GULF OF MEXICO AND THEY FOUND THAT WHILE. THE PLATFORMS WERE ACTING AS A STEPPING STONE FOR THE SPREAD OF INVASIVE SPECIES THEY WEREN'T SPREADING AT A RATE ANY GREATER THAN THE NATURAL NEARBY BRIEFS. NEXT SLIDE. ANOTHER CON WE SEE AS A LACK OF PUBLIC UNDERSTANDING FOR WHEN MOST PEOPLE SEE OFFER PLATFORMS UNLESS YOU'RE A DIVER FISHERMAN YOU. LIKELY HAVE NO IDEA THAT THERE COULD BE A MARINE ECOSYSTEM BENEATH THE SURFACE. THIS IS WHERE A LOT OF OUR WORK IS REALLY FOCUSED ON DISSEMINATING THE SCIENCE AND COMMUNICATING TO THE PUBLIC THE VALUE OF THE STRUCTURES. AS ARTIFICIAL REEFS. AND THIS ALSO WILL HELP THEM TO MAKE. INFORMED DECISIONS REGARDING THE FUTURE OF THEIR OCEAN RESOURCES NEXT SLIDE. ANOTHER CON WE SEE IS IF THE STRUCTURES ARE PERMANENTLY INSTALLED AS RE STABLE BE. AN OBSTRUCTION ON THE SEA FLOOR TO LIMIT OTHER. OCEAN USERS FROM ACCESSING THAT SPACE ONE POTENTIAL CONFLICT COULD ARISE WITH TROLL FISHERMEN WHO. TROLLING IS LIKE TAKING A GIGANTIC NOT THE SIZE OF A FOOTBALL FIELD AND RUNNING ALONG THE SEA FLOOR MALIK MAY HAVE SOME DESTRUCTIVE COMPONENT TO IT IT IS A VIABLE FISHING INDUSTRY AND WITH THESE PLATFORMS IN THE WAY IT THEIR INSTRUCTION TO THAT PARTICULAR FISHERY. NEXT SLIDE. NOW TAKE A QUICK LOOK AT SOME OF THE PROS AND THE POTENTIAL FOR THE STRUCTURES TO ENHANCE OUR LOCAL FISHERIES NEXT SLIDE ESPECIALLY AS OUR- NEXT SLIDE. ESPECIALLY AS OUR NEARSHORE HABITATS ARE DEGRADED BY. RUNOFF POLLUTION OVERFISHING WHAT WE'RE FINDING IS THAT MANY SPECIES ARE MOVING OFF SHORE AND MAKING THEIR PERMANENT HOME ON THESE PLATFORMS NEXT SLIDE. ANOTHER PRO WE SEE IS THE ECONOMIC BENEFITS IT'S BEEN DISCUSSED HERE TODAY THAT THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH DECOMMISSIONING. IF A STRUCTURE IS REACHED THERE WILL BE A SIGNIFICANT COST SAVINGS AND- ACCORDING TO AB TWENTY FIVE OH THREE A PORTION OF THAT SAVINGS WOULD GO BACK TO THE STATE INTO AN ENDOWMENT FOR MARINE PRESERVATION AND CONSERVATION NEXT SLIDE. IN FACT IF TWENTY THREE OF CALIFORNIA'S TWENTY SEVEN PLATFORMS WERE REMOVED THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WOULD GET 600-528-0050 MILLION. AS PART OF A TOTAL ONE BILLION AND SAVE COSTS. EXCITED. WE HAVE RESOURCES AVAILABLE AT BLUE LATITUDE FOUNDATION DOT ORG HANDPRINT PLEASE FEEL FREE TO REACH OUT TO ME- VIA VIA MY EMAIL AND I LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING COLLABORATIVE DISCUSSIONS WITH YOU ALL ABOUT THIS IMPORTANT CONSERVATION ISSUE. THANK YOU AT QUESTIONS. I HAVE I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS TO AND WE EVER HEARD THAT THE REEFS THAT'S RIGHT THE RAGS OF CALIFORNIA'S COAST ARE IN WATER I THINK IT'S YOU KNOW FROM THIRTY EIGHT FEET TO TWELVE HUNDRED FEET DEEP- SUIT WHAT ARE THE CRITERIA THAT MAKE A RAKE SUITABLE FOR YOU KNOW EVEN CONSIDERING THIS THIS KIND OF THING. ARE THERE CERTAIN DEPTH REQUIREMENTS- ARE THERE ANY LIMITATIONS TO WHAT KIND OF A RIG COULD ACTUALLY BE APPROPRIATE FOR ROOFING ABSOLUTELY SO. EVERY PLATFORM NEEDS TO BE AT. LOOKED AT ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS AND WATER DEPTH PLAYS. PLAYS IN SIGNIFICANTLY HERE ESPECIALLY IF WE NEED TO- IT HERE TO THE U. S. COAST CARDS REGULATION OF HAVING AT CUT OFF DEPTH OF EIGHTY FIVE FEET. OBVIOUSLY THE PLATFORMS IN SHALLOWER WATERS ARE NOT GOING TO BE. A GREAT CANDIDATE COMPLEXITY IS ANOTHER. MAJOR COMPONENT A STRUCTURE THAT IS MORE COMPLEX WILL LIKELY HAVE MORE NOOKS AND CRANNIES AREAS FOR MARINE LIFE THAT TO DEVELOP. AND SO THAT'S ANOTHER CRITICAL COMPONENT THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT- IN CALIFORNIA SOME OF OUR PLATFORMS HAVE BURNED STALLED DECADES AGO AND SO THEIR TECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS AS WELL IN TERMS OF HOW WE CAN FEASIBLY REMOVE THAT STRUCTURE AND WHERE ARE WE GOING TO BRING IT ON SHORE OR DISMANTLE IT IN ANOTHER AREA SO THOSE ARE ALL CONSIDERATIONS THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT. AND SO THAT THE- TWENTY SEVEN PLATFORMS- IN IN CALIFORNIA WATERS. DO YOU HAVE AN ASSESSMENT ON AROUND HIM HOW MANY OF THOSE MIGHT BE SUITABLE FOR ROOFING. WE HAVE NOT DONE AN ASSESSMENT ON HOW MANY WOULD BE A SUITABLE FOR ROOFING BUT THERE ARE MANY THAT WOULD BE APPLICABLE CANDIDATES. YES I KNOW THAT THERE ARE TWENTY THREE AND FEDERAL WATERS AND AS YOU GO FURTHER OFF SHORE IT YOU GAIN GREATER AND GREATER DEATH WRITTEN SO THOSE COULD BE POTENTIALLY. GOOD CANDIDATES. AND I THINK WE HAVE I'M MISS CRAP. ON FOR THIS PANEL AS WELL THIS IN YOUR PRESENTATION AS WELL I DO YOU HAVE A PET HAVE YOU OR YOUR ORGANISATION DONE AN ASSESSMENT AROUND. I DON'T WHAT PLATFORMS IN FEDERAL AT SORRY IN CALIFORNIA WATERS WOULD POTENTIALLY BE SUITABLE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- WHAT WE HAVE TO LOOK AT IS- THE CRITERIA THAT ARE ESTABLISHED IN THE STATE LAW- SO THESE HAVEN'T BEEN APPLIED YET BUT THE CRITERIA REQUIRE- THE STATE TO CONSIDER THE DEPTH OF THE PLATFORM THE LOCATION OF THE PLATFORM AND PROXIMITY TO OTHER REEFS- TO LOOK AT POTENTIAL IMPACTS TO BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES AND WATER QUALITY FOR FULL REMOVAL VERSUS PARTIAL REMOVAL. LOOK AT POTENTIAL BENEFITS TO THE ENVIRONMENT A FULL VERSUS PARTIAL REMOVAL- LOOK AT THE CONTRIBUTION TO PRODUCTIVITY OF FICTION WRITING LIFE AND FINALLY TO LOOK AT POTENTIAL MANAGEMENT RESTRICTIONS SUCH AS DEALING WITH FISHING- ON THE STRUCTURES SO AFTER ALL THAT ANALYSIS IS DONE THE STATE IS REQUIRED ON THE PLATFORM BY PLATFORM BASIS TO DETERMINE WHICH OPTION PROVIDES THE NET BENEFIT TO THE RATE ENVIRONMENT- I AGREE WITH DESPITE THAT- THE SHOWER PLATFORM PROBABLY DON'T EVEN QUALIFY BECAUSE OF THE NAVIGATIONAL REQUIREMENTS BUT- I THINK THE TAKEAWAY HERE IS THAT WE'RE EMBARKING ON THAT PROCESS- HOLLY WILL BE THE FIRST PLATFORM BUT THERE'S- EIGHT. IN THE QUEUE NOW WE THINK THAT NUMBER WILL INCREASE PRETTY DRAMATICALLY GIVEN THAT MOST OF THE PLATFORMS OFFER CALIFORNIA ARE NOT PRODUCING VERY MUCH- AND- ARMIES OF SCALE WILL MAKE THE- MORE FOR- ONE. THE COMPANIES COULD- JOINT. INSURANCE OF THE CALL WORKS ONE THE LARGEST COSTS OF DECOMMISSIONING IS BRING IN THE RESOLVER FROM THE NORTH SEA- THAT'S BEEN IMPEDIMENT. BUT NOW THEY CAN SHARE THOSE COSTS AND SO WE THINK WE'RE GOING TO SEE THAT NUMBER GO UP WE'RE GONNA YOU HAVE THESE ANALYSES I'M AS WELL AS THE ENVIRONMENT REVIEW SO I THINK WE'RE ON OUR WAY- AND THEN WE'LL- FIND OUT WHICH PLATFORMS. ARE APPROPRIATE- TO BE- PARTIALLY REMOVED AND WHICH ARE MORE APPROPRIATE TO BE FULLY REMOVED. AND I SUIT THE EX MARINE CALIFORNIA'S MARINE RESOURCES LEGACY ACT- WE SPACE PASSED IN TWENTY TEN IN AT LEAST IN CONCEPT ESTABLISHED TO RIGS TO REEF. FRAMEWORK FOR CALIFORNIA- IS YOU BOTH MENTIONED IN YOUR REMARKS THAT. HAS NOT RESULTED IN ANY. OF THESE PLATFORMS ACTUALLY BEING RECEIVED I'M REALLY INTERESTED IN BOTH OF YOUR PERSPECTIVES- ROUND OUT WHY THAT'S THAT HAS BEEN THE CASE. AND IF THERE ARE APPROPRIATE- MODIFICATIONS TO THAT OR IF THERE ARE MARK MODIFICATIONS TO THAT FACT THAT YOU BELIEVE WOULD BE APPROPRIATE. WELL I CAN YEAH I THINK THAT. IS AREALLY SIMPLE ANSWER WHICH AT JUNE GENERAL CASEY MENTION. THE STATE CANNOT FORCE THE COMPANY TO DECOMMISSION PLATFORM. ONCE THAT LEASES ISSUED AND PRODUCTION AND SUSE THE COMPANY CONTINUED TO PRODUCING AS LONG AS THEY WANT WHAT WE'RE SEEING NOW IS- LOBBYIST. EVERITT STALLED WHAT YOU DON'T SIXTIES YEARS AGO ARE WRAPPING UP THEIR- VIABLE PRODUCTIVE LIFE AND SO WE ARE STARTING TO SEE POPCORN SNAPPING DECOMMISSION WE HAVE EIGHT IN THE Q. AND AS I MENTIONED I COULD SEE THAT DOUBLE IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS- SO IT'S NOT TOO MANY PEOPLE OF THE LAW IT'S BEEN A ECONOMIC- DETERMINATION BY THESE- PLATFORM OPERATORS AND OWNERS. THEY ARE THIRTIES DECOMMISSIONED- SO NOW LET'S LET THE LAW WORK. YES THANK YOU LINDA JUST TIME ADD ON TO THE I WOULD SAY THAT. SOME OF THE ISSUES WITH THE LAW OUR- PRIMARILY WITH THE LIABILITY FOR THE STRUCTURE ITSELF WHILE THE WELLS RICH REMAIN WITH THE OIL COMPANIES SO SHOULD THERE EVER BE A LEAK OR SPILL THEY'LL ALWAYS BE RESPONSIBLE THE LIABILITY FOR THAT PLATFORM JACKET IT'S NOT CLEARLY STATED IN AB TWENTY FIVE OH THREE WHO WOULD. TAKE THAT ON AND SO. IT WOULD DEFAULT TO THE OIL COMPANIES TO RETAIN THAT LIABILITY BUT THE OIL COMPANIES ARE NOT INTERESTED AND HOLDING ON TO THE STRUCTURE. MULTIPLE YEARS DOWN THE LINE AS IT'S FUNCTIONING AS AN ARTIFICIAL REEF AND SO IN THE GULF OF MEXICO WHAT THEY HAVE DONE IS. THEY HAVE DEVELOPED DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE ARTIFICIAL REEF AND RIGS TO REEF PROGRAMS IN LOUISIANA TEXAS MISSISSIPPI AND THOSE PROGRAMS. MANAGE THESE STRUCTURES AND TAKE ON THE LIABILITY AS THEY MANAGE ALL THE OTHER ARTIFICIAL REEFS UNDER THEIR JURISDICTION. AND IF WE WERE TO LOOK AT THE GULF OF MEXICO AS AN EXAMPLE WE COULD SAY WE COULD ESTABLISH A RIGS TO REEF PROGRAM THROUGH OUR DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE TO TAKE ON THAT LIABILITY. AND THE LEGISLATION WOULD NEED TO HAVE SOME ADJUSTMENTS TO ACCOMMODATE FOR THAT TRANSFER OF LIABILITY AND MAKE IT CLEAR OF THAT SPECIFIC PATHWAY AND SO THAT COULD BE ONE OPTION THAT WOULD POTENTIALLY. MAKE IT AN INCENTIVIZE BOTH THE OIL COMPANIES AND THE STATE TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS LAW AND THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL SENATE BILLS THAT HAVE. TRIED TO MAKES CERTAIN REVISIONS FOR THE LAW TO MAKE IT. YOU KNOW MORE. ACCEPTABLE BY THIS STAKEHOLDERS INVOLVED BUT NONE OF THOSE HAVE EFFECTIVELY CHANGE THE LAW. IF I MIGHT ADD ON TO THAT- RIGHT AND NOW WE'RE RUNNING SHORT ON TIME I'D JUST LIKE TO RESPOND REAL QUICKLY FIRST OF ALL- THERE HAVE BEEN EFFORTS TO CHANGE- AB- FIVE OH THREE NONE OF THEM HAVE DEALT WITH THE LIABILITY ISSUE THEY'VE ALL DEALT WITH TRYING TO WEAKEN. THE SCIENTIFIC ANALYSIS NUMBER TWO AND THE GULF OF MEXICO THEY DON'T HAVE ANY NATURAL ROCKY WEEK HABITAT SO THEY KIND OF VIABLE. ARTIFICIAL REEF PROGRAM FOR YEARS AND THE WAY THEY'VE ADAPTED TO MAKE ST AS- THEY HAVE SET ARTIFICIALLY SITES AT THE STATE DOES MANAGE PRIMARILY FOR RECREATIONAL FISHING. THEY ALLOW CLOUT FROM OPERATORS TO CONTRIBUTE SOME MATERIALS TO THOSE REVIEW SITES THEY DON'T GO AROUND AND MANAGE EVERY SINGLE PLATFORM- OPERATOR DOESN'T WANT TO REMOVE. THAT WOULD BE UNTENABLE SO UP.FOR THE MOST PART I KNOW SOMETIMES PLATFORMS REMAIN A PLACE BUT FOR THE MOST PART THEY ARE REMOVED AND THE COMPANIES THAT CAN CONTRIBUTE SOME MATERIALS TO. A SET MANAGED RECREATIONAL FISHING A REEF SO IT'S VERY DIFFERENT THAT WHAT'S BEING PROPOSED HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND- I CAN TELL YOU I'VE WORKED ON. ALL THE BILL SINCE NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT. ONLY READ AB TWO FIVE OR PASS WHAT BECAUSE OF IN DOWN TO. PROVISION STATE NOT WANT LIABILITY IN PERPETUITY FOR THE SITES- IT'S JUST NOT ECONOMICALLY STE- RESPONSIBLE FOR THE STATE TO DO. WELL THANK YOU BOTH I HAD. A QUESTION FROM SOMEONE OF THEM- NOT NOT A QUESTION REALLY- A COMMENT PERHAPS THAT'S A NOTE OF CAUTION- I APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT TO OTHERS A LOT OF FOUGHT THAT'S BEING CUT PUT AN- END TO THIS PROGRAM- BUT I HAVE TO PUT HIM EXTREMELY UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THE ENTIRE TOPIC AND THE REASON- IS. FACTUAL AND EMOTIONAL FOR ME WE'VE BEEN USING THE OCEANS AS OUR GARBAGE CANS WHEN I SAY WE I MEAN. THE HUMAN RACE HAS BEEN USING THE OCEANS AS OUR GARBAGE CANS FOR CENTURIES- YOU KNOW WE'VE THROWN EVERYTHING FROM PLASTIC BAGS TO- THINGS THAT BREAK DOWN INTO MICROPLASTICS TO FISHING LINE AND FOLKS SURE I MEAN WE FOR YOU FOR YEARS BOTH WERE JUST SUNK IN PLACE- SPARE TIRE AND NOT SPARE TIRES USED TIRES- THAT EVERYTHING UNDER THE SUN. IS SITTING ON THE FLOOR OF THE OCEAN WHY DO WE NOT PAY THAT MUCH ATTENTION TO IT WE DON'T SEE IT- BUT IT IT IS POLLUTING AND FOLLOWING GOT WATER AROUND THE GLOBE. AND. I YOU KNOW I RECOGNIZE THAT THESE STRUCTURES ARE OUT THERE AND WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO WITH THEM- YOU KNOW NOW THAT THEY'RE OUT THERE ALREADY BUT THE UNTANGLING OF THIS PROBLEM- IS ONE. THAT I THINK WE NEED TO GIVE AN EXTREME AMOUNT OF THOUGHT TO- AND NOT JUST. CONCEPTUALLY THINK WELL YOU KNOW WE GET TO TURN THIS INTO A ROOF IT'S LEFT OVER GARBAGE THAT WE ARE TRYING TO TRANSITION TO SOMETHING THAT'S USEFUL BUT IT'S STILL GARBAGE- AND WE DON'T THINK ABOUT THIS IN THE CONTEXT OF MAYBE THAT THE STRUCTURE SHOULD BE THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE- THERE'S A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF. I'LL BE SELF CRITICAL- IN IN MAKING THIS STATEMENT I BELIEVE AN OFFSHORE WIND YOU KNOW SO THERE'S GOING TO HAVE TO BE STRUCTURES FOR THAT- I JUST WANT US TO NOT BE ONLY THINKING ABOUT. THIS FROM- YOU KNOW A SINGULAR PERSPECTIVE- WE SHOULD BE THINKING HOLISTICALLY ABOUT THIS PROBLEM- BECAUSE IT'S NOT JUST THE- OF THE OIL RIGS THAT ARE OUT THERE THERE'S A LOT MORE THAT NEEDS TO BE CLEANED UP IN THE OCEAN. YES THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THOSE COMMENTS I HAVE IF I MAY RESPOND TO THAT I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH WHAT YOU'RE WHO. ARE SAYING AND I THINK THAT THIS REALLY CALLS TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW PROCESS THAT IS BEING PRESENTED TO US THROUGH THE- THROUGH THE EIS AND THROUGH OUR SEQUEL PROCESS WE CAN REALLY RELY ON THAT AS AN IMPORTANT TOOL FOR LOOKING AT. USING PORTENT ENVIRONMENTAL DECISIONS THAT WE HAVE TO MAKE WITH A PROBLEM THAT YORK THEY FROZE SUBWAY CARS AND YOU'RE RIGHT TIRES OFF OF FLORIDA. AND OUR OCEANS ARE NOT A DUMPING GROUND AND THIS IS A MOMENT WHERE WE NEED TO LOOK AT AN EXISTING PROBLEM AND UNDERSTAND WHAT THE BEST ENVIRONMENTAL OPTION IS. AND I THINK THAT WE CAN FALL BACK ON THOSE ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT PROCESSES THAT ARE IN PLACE SO THAT WE CAN COME TO THE BEST DECISION FOR OUR PLANET FOR PEOPLE HERE. THANK YOU. APPLE THANK YOU AGAIN I. MISS CROP AND- INSPECTS FOR BEING HERE AND JOINING US EFFORT FOR THE HEARING REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR INSIGHT AND PERSPECTIVE. I WITH THAT WE'RE WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND ADD TRANSITION TO PUBLIC COMMENTS. I INDIVIDUALS ONCE AGAIN WHO WISH TO PARTICIPATE IN PUBLIC COMMENT- AT THE TOLL FREE NUMBER IS. EIGHT SEVEN SEVEN SIX NINE TWO EIGHT NINE FIVE SEVEN. AND THE ACCESS CODE AGAIN IS. ONE THREE ONE FIVE FOUR TWO ZERO Q. AND- I WILL ASK SPEAKERS TO LIMIT THEIR COMMENTS TO TWO MINUTES- IN ORDER TO ENSURE TIME FOR ALL. PARTICIPANTS IF THERE'S ANYONE I IN THE PUB AT ANY MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC WHO IS HERE IN THE ROOM. PLEASE RAISE YOUR HAND AND- I'LL GO AHEAD AND INVITE YOU TO APPROACH THE MICROPHONE. PLEASE. SOME OF MY. HI CAN YOU HEAR ME YES HI- GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME TODAY MY NAME IS NATALIE CHAPMAN I AM A GRADUATE STUDENT AT UC DAVIS- AND THEIR ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY AND MANAGEMENT PROGRAM I'VE BEEN RESEARCHING THE OFFER OIL DECOMMISSIONING PROCESS FOR FOUR YEARS THROUGHOUT MY UNDERGRAD AND THEN NOW I CONTINUING ON WITH IT I DO HAVE AN AFFILIATION WITH A LOT OF HIS FOUNDATION AS AN INTERN WITH THEM BUT- I LIKE TO JUST SAY AND POINT OUT THAT THERE. COULD BE A REALLY- INTERESTING POTENTIAL FOR CONSERVATION PURPOSES AS SOME OF OUR PANELISTS TODD ALSO SAID TODAY- I ALSO PUSHING FOR CALIFORNIA'S INITIATIVES AND GOALS SUCH AS THE COP THE THIRTY BY THIRTY INITIATIVES AND OPPORTUNITIES TO CONSERVE AND HOPEFULLY BRIDGE- INDUSTRY AND ALLOW FOR CONSERVATION INDUSTRY TO- INTERMIX IN A WAY THAT HASN'T HISTORICALLY BEEN ALLOWABLE- AND ALL. HOPEFULLY SAID A PRECEDENT FOR FUTURE WORKS IN CONSERVATION. AND THAT. WE CARE ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS TO OUR OCEANS FOR EXAMPLE WE CARE WITH THESE ARE MINDFUL DECISIONS THAT ARE HAPPENING. AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO BE SETTING A PRECEDENT AS WE CONTINUE TO DEVELOP AND MAKE- BEST MANAGER BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AND RESOURCE MANAGEMENT. AND GENERAL AND I RESOURCE MANAGEMENT EXTRACTIONS SO JUST MOVING FORWARD- WE CAN USE THIS AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO SET THAT PRECEDENT- SUSTAINABILITY AND THINKING OF WHOLE LIFE STRUCTURES AND WHOLE LIFE- IMPLICATIONS OF WHAT WE DO WITH OUR- RESOURCES HERE CALIFORNIA. SO THANK YOU AGAIN FOR YOUR TIME- I REALLY APPRECIATE EVERYONE'S INSIGHTFUL COMMENTS AND THE PANELISTS. AND ESPECIALLY- THE OPPORTUNITIES WITH YOU TODAY AND I WOULD ALSO YEAH I'M REALLY INTERESTED IN LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING HOW THE STATE- HANDLES THE INTERESTING INTERSECTION OF INDUSTRY CONSERVATION AND THE PUBLIC UNTIL SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU. FIFTEEN I KNOW MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC IN THE ROOM MACHINE TO SPEAK AT THIS TIME I'LL GO AHEAD AND- WILL OPEN UP THAT TURNED IT OVER TO OUR MODERATOR TO OPEN UP THE PHONE LINES. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND LADIES AND GENTLEMEN IF YOU WISH TO COMMENT ON TODAY'S CALL YOU MAY PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME. IF YOU ARE ON A SPEAKER PHONE PLEASE PICK UP THE HANDSET BEFORE PRESSING THE NUMBERS. AN OPERATOR WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH YOUR LINE NUMBER AND ONE CHEN MY NUMBER. IS PROVIDED. PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME AND AFFILIATION IF NECESSARY AND ONCE AGAIN IF YOU HAVE A COMMENT ON TODAY'S CALL YOU MAY PRESS ONE AND IN GENERAL AT THIS TIME NINE TWENTY YOUR LINE IS OPEN. ONE MOMENT. TWENTY YOUR LINE IS OPEN PLEASE GO AHEAD- MEMBERS- OF THE FAMILY MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS CHRIS HANNAN AND I'M REPRESENTING THE FORTY AN AFFILIATE AND HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND MEMBERS OF THE LOS ANGELES ORANGE COUNTY'S. BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL- I STAND IN SOLIDARITY- AND ALL OF OUR MEMBERS STAND VOLUNTARY WITH THE STATE BUILDING CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL CALIFORNIA- ARE BUILDING TRADE UNIONS ARE PARTNERSHIPS ARE OPPORTUNITIES. FOR HARD WORKING CALIFORNIANS TO GO TO WORK- THIS INCLUDES CALIFORNIA THAT- REPORTLINKER. CALIFORNIANS THAT GIRL BEEN- UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES AND WE GO TO WORK EVERY DAY- OPERATED PROJECTS INCLUDING PROJECTS IN THE OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY- ARTIFICIALLY- ELIMINATING LOCAL PRODUCTION- THE ENERGY NEEDS FOR CALIFORNIA IS SHORT SIGHTED- WE ARE COMMITTED TO WORKING ON ALTERNATIVE ENERGY SOURCES WORLD. WAR COMMITTED TO WORKING TOGETHER WITH THE STATE TO MEET CLIMATE GOALS- BUT ARTIFICIALLY- ENDING LOCAL PRODUCTION WALL- WHILE CALIFORNIANS ARE STILL USING IT DOES NOTHING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM IT IT'S- WORSE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT BECAUSE THERE'S NO PLACE THAT HAS. ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS HIGHEST CALIFORNIA- WHEN WE WORK TOGETHER- THE WIND PROJECT WE HAVE RECEIVED BIRTH DISPENSED OR- HERE LOCALLY IN THE COURT- YOU KNOW ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WERE WORKING TOGETHER ON ALTERNATIVE FUELS FOR THE AVIATION INDUSTRY WERE RECEIVING PUSHBACK IN PARAMOUNT. IT'S NOT A COUPLE JOBS WE HAVE FIFTEEN HUNDRED MEMBERS. THAT ARE GOING TO GO TO WORK. EVERY DAY ON THAT WERE AND- FOR. FUELS THAT ARE GOING HELP SUPPLY ABA AND- WITH- WITH. THE ANIMAL FEELS WERE WERE SAYING BLOCKS ALL OVER THE PLACE WE NEED TO BE THOUGHTFUL ABOUT THIS AND I WANT TO ECHO THE COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE BY THE STATE BUILDING TRADE THE ERROR MADE. WE NEED TO BE THOUGHTFUL ABOUT THIS WE NEED TO MOVE GOOD PROJECTS BUT WE SHOULD BE SO SHORT SIGHTED IT. TAKES A LOT OF WORK TO KEEP A HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND MEMBERS BUSY. ANYONE OF LOS ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND MEMBERS ARE NOW APPRENTICES JUST BEGINNING THEIR CAREER AND TO PULL THE RUG OUT FROM UNDERNEATH THEM WHILE THEY'RE TRAINING- IS JUST THE WRONG DECISION TO MAKE RIGHT NOW. I STAND IN SOLIDARITY WITH THE STATE BUILDING TRADES THANK YOU. THANK YOU. NINE TWENTY FOUR YOUR LINE IS OPEN PLEASE GO AHEAD- YEAH THIS IS- JEFF ON A LOCKER WITH THE- HUMBLE DON'T BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION TRADES I WANT TO ECHO THE COMMENTS OF THE SPEAKER BEFORE. BUT TRULY HOME TO MAKE IT SHORT AND SWEET- ERIN DID YOU YOU DID FROM- A GREAT JOB- FROM THE STATE BUILDING TRADES AND WE SUPPORT ALL OF THE COMMENTS FROM THE STRAIGHT STATE BUILDING TRADES- REGARDING THIS SO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK AND WE GOT TO WATCH OUT FOLKS WHAT WE DO. BECAUSE WE'RE PUTTING PEOPLE OUT OF WORK AND WE HAVE TO HAVE JOBS BUT BEFORE WE DO THAT SO CAN WE NEED TO STUFF. UNFORTUNATELY SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU. NINE TWENTY FIVE YOUR LINE IS OPEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. HI THIS IS LAUREN CALM POLICY ADVOCATE FOR KIRKUK CAL REPRESENTING THIRTEEN CAP AND HAPPENED MEMBERS SUPPORTERS THE STATE I'D LIKE THANK THE CHAIR MEMBER OF THIS CAN. OF ALL THE FOR THE AND THE CA ON THE FERRY IMPORTANT AS THE STATE IS WORKING TRANSITIONING OFF FOSSIL FUELS EVERYONE IN THE STATE OF KNOWN FOR DECADES THAT OIL DRILLING WHETHER OFFSHORE OR ONSHORE IS DANGEROUS AND HARMFUL FOR COMMUNITY PUBLIC HEALTH ECOSYSTEMS AND CLIMATE WE'RE LONG PAST THE TIME TRYING TO TRANSITION AWAY FROM DANGERS WILL DRAWING AND TRANSITION TOWARDS A HEALTHIER. PAPER CLEAN ENERGY FUTURE AND ALTHOUGH THE HEARING OF PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON OFFSHORE OIL DRILLING AND DECOMMISSIONING THE CONVERSATION HERE WILL ALSO BE IMPORTANT FOR DECOMMISSIONING AND REMEDIATION PROCESSES THAT WILL HAPPEN ON SHORT SO I'D LIKE TO ECHO THE COMMENTS MADE BY TEAM IN THE COMING WITH ENERGY HE AND OTHERS TODAY AND REITERATE THE NEED TO HOLD THOSE ESPONSIBLE PARTIES AND INDUSTRY ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE MASSIVE LEFT BEHIND. WE MUST CONTINUE TO UPHOLD THE POLLUTER PAYS PRINCIPLE IN CALIFORNIA THE STATE'S NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING THE COST OF CLEANING UP THE POLLUTION HAZARD OF THE OIL INDUSTRY WE ARE COUNTING ON THE STATE TO ENSURE THAT AS WE TRANSITION AWAY AND SHUT DOWN OIL EXTRACTION. ALL PARTIES WHETHER THAT'S SPECIFIC. OR THE INDUSTRY A WHOLE. BUT THE ONE PAYING FOR THE DOWN OF WELCOME ANY ROOM YOU. THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN. MANY OF. TO BE MADE TO ENSURE THE CALL CAN OUR COVER FROM THE SPOT PARTIES ARE FROM THE END. AS A WHOLE HOW TO THE PER ALL. FEET AWAY FIND WE ALSO NEED TO BE. BY MARK. INCREASE TO ENSURE THE STATE FINANCE COMPLETED FROM. CLOSURE CALL. WE ARE COUNTY ON THE THREE DECISION MAY TO CREATE CLEAR PA. THAT WILL PROTECT THE STATE TAXPAYER AN INCH. DE COSTS ARE RIGHTLY COVERED BY THE END OF. THANK YOU CAN PRETTY OPPORTUNITY TO COMMENT YOUR CALL CALIFORNIA LOOKS FORWARD TO WORKING THE LEGISLATURE. ON THIS ISSUE. THANK YOU. NINE TWENTY EIGHT YOUR LINE OPEN GO AHEAD. HI I'M ONE TWENTY EIGHT AND I REPRESENT ALL OF THE CONCERNED CITIZENS WHO ARE WATCHING THIS- GREEN AGENDA GET FORCED IT DOWN OUR THROATS AND I'D LIKE TO READ FROM A DOCUMENT AP ARE A ERA GREAT TODAY'S BETTER TOMORROWS. SIX REASONS WHY CALIFORNIA NEEDS THE OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION THE GOLDEN STATE CONSUMES EVERY BARREL OF OIL AND GAS PRODUCED YEAR AND IMPORTS SO WAY WAY MORE OTHER QUICK FACTS ABOUT THE INDUSTRY THAT POWERS CALIFORNIA. NUMBER ONE CALIFORNIANS USE OIL AND NATURAL GAS EVERY DAY AS PART OF OUR DAILY LIVES NUMBER TWO OIL AND NATURAL GAS POWER KANEMI ONE POINT FIVE BILLION IN STATE AND LOCAL TAX REVENUE TO FUND VITAL COMMUNITY SERVICES EDUCATION HEALTH AND PUBLIC SAFETY. FIFTY THOUSAND HIGH PAYING JOBS FOR WORKING FAMILIES FROM DIVERSE BACKGROUNDS THIRTY ONE THOUSAND IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY A SAFE AFFORDABLE AND RELIABLE ENERGY SUPPLY THAT FUELS CARDS HE TOLD SPORTS BUSINESSES GROSS FOOD AND PRODUCES EVERYDAY PRODUCTS. REGIONALLY ABOUT THREE QUARTERS OF IN STATE OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION OCCURS IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY WHERE THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IS ALREADY TWO POINT ONE PERCENTAGE POINTS HIGHER THAN THE REST OF THE STATE. NUMBER THREE CALIFORNIA OIL AND GAS IS PRODUCED UNDER SOME OF THE MOST STRINGENT REGULATIONS IN THE WORLD- ALL PRODUCED BY FOREIGN SOURCES ISN'T SUBJECT TO THE RIGOROUS ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW GREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION AND WORKER SAFETY INSPECTIONS PRESENT IN CALIFORNIA NUMBER FOR CALIFORNIA NEEDS A LOCAL OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION TO ENSURE RELIABILITY AND AFFORDABILITY FOR CONSUMERS. CALIFORNIA CONSUMES ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION BARRELS OF OIL A DAY TO MEET ITS ENERGY NEEDS ABOUT ONE QUARTER OF OIL AND GAS IS PRODUCED IN STATE. THE REST OF IMPORTED FROM DOMESTIC AND RE. CALIFORNIA CONSUME EVERY BATTLE OF OIL AND PRODUCED IN THE STATE NEUTRALIZE OF CRUDE OIL PIPELINE INFRASTRUCTURE CALIFORNIA IS DISCONNECTED FROM THE OTHER LOWER FORTY EIGHT. TWENTY SECONDS I COULD GO ON AND ON AND INSTEAD I LISTEN TO YOU WHAT MAKERS DISMISSED THE ACT BURKE IN THE OIL INDUSTRY- I UNDERSTAND WAY MORE THAN YOU PEOPLE EVER WILL YOU'RE ASKING WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THE WORDS. THANK YOU MY- LET'S GO TO THE CALL THINK YOU. ONE SEVENTY YOUR LINE IS OPEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. AFTERNOON MEMBERS MY NAME IS MIKE WEST AND I REPRESENT THE MEN AND WOMEN OF DISTRICT COUNCIL SIXTEEN PAINTERS AND ALLIED TRADES HUNDREDS OF MEN AND WOMEN WORKING IN THE REFINERIES TODAY RATHER THAN ECHO THE SENTIMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUES. I WANT TO SPEAK TO YOU ON A HISTORIC AND COMMON SENSE- ISSUE IF YOU LOOK BACK AT THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION STARTING BACK. WHEN BURNING COAL AND THE STEAM ENGINE WAS THE ORDER OF THE DAY AND THE TRANSITION BETWEEN THAT AND OIL REFINING AND THE INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE. THOSE TRANSITION TOOK DECADE. AND THE CURRENT INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION THAT WE'RE IN RIGHT NOW IT'S CALLED RENEWABLE ENERGY SO NOW I'M GONNA GIVE YOU ANOTHER ANALOGY I WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL IN THE LATE SEVENTIES AND EARLY EIGHTIES AND I DID MY REPORT BY DOING RESEARCH AND BOOK AN ENCYCLOPEDIA WELL WE DIDN'T THROW AWAY THE ENCYCLOPEDIAS UNTIL WE HAD THE INTERNET SO MY POINT BEING IS THAT- WE HAVE TO LET INNOVATION OF THE RENEWABLE ENERGY TAKE PLACE BEFORE THE TRANSITION AWAY FROM THAT MAKES SENSE. SO ANYTHING SHORT OF THAT IS BULLISH AND SHORT SIGHTED BUT ALSO RECKLESS SO WITH THAT SAID- I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. AND THAT CONCLUDES MY COMMENTS THANK YOU. NINE THIRTY ONE YOUR LINE IS OPEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. HI GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS LAUREN CHASE I AM A STAFF ATTORNEY WITH ORANGE COUNTY COAST KEEPER OUT BUT BEYOND THAT I AM A BECAUSE YOU MISTER RESIDENT I'M AN ORANGE COUNTY THIRD FOR- AND- AN ADVOCATE FOR DECOMMISSIONING WE HAVE PLATFORMS OFFER CLOSE BY HAD THIRTY FIVE YOUR ESTIMATED LIFESPAN AND HAVE NOW LIVED LONG PAST THAT. THEY'RE BEING HELD UP BY FEDERER WORLD P. RELIEF PROGRAMS THAT ARE MAKING THEM ARTIFICIALLY PROFITABLE EARLIER YOU HEARD A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE ECONOMIC TERM FOR THE LEE SAYS I JUST IN TWENTY TWENTY AMPLIFY ENERGY'S. REALTY RAGE RATIONALLY SLICED IN HALF BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT- ALLOWING THEM TO CONTINUE OPERATING THEIR LEASES WHEN THEY MAY NOT OF BEEN PROFITABLE- CURRENTLY FIVE OUT OF SEVEN OF OUR OFF SHORE PLATFORMS ARE SHUT DOWN DUE TO LEAKING PIPELINES EARLIER WE HEARD SOME QUESTIONING ABOUT WHETHER THERE WOULD BE OTHER SPELLS IN. QUESTION THAT HAD AN IMPACT THEIR HOT BUTTON- THE POP OF PIPELINE CONNECTING POP OR EVEN TO SHORE ACTUALLY GONE TO BE LEAKING AND DECEMBER WHICH HAS RESULTED IN PRIVATE SEVEN OF OUR PLATFORMS CURRENTLY BEING SHOT AND- SO I APPRECIATED WOMAN BRINGING.
