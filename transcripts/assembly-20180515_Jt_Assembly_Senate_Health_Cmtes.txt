GOOD AFTERNOON WILL GO AHEAD AND GET STARTED WITH THEIR HEARING NOW WE WILL BE EXPECTING SOME OTHER MEMBERS TO JOIN US BUT TO THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. THIS IS A JOINT HEARING A SET OF THE ASSEMBLY SENATE AND HEALTH. ON ON TWO INITIATIVES TODAY. STATE LAW REQUIRES THAT WANTS PROPONENTS OF A PROPOSED INITIATIVE WHO GATHER TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE NUMBER OF SIGNATURES REQUIRED. THEY CERTIFY THAT THEY HAVE DONE SO TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE. THE SECRETARY OF STATE THEN PROVIDES COPIES OF THE PROPOSED INITIATIVE TO THE LEGISLATURE. EACH HOUSE ASSIGNS THE PROPOSED INITIATIVE MEASURE TO THE APPROPRIATE COMMITTEES AND HOLDS JOINT PUBLIC HEARINGS. AT LEAST ONE HUNDRED THIRTY ONE DAYS BEFORE UP BEFORE THE DATE OF THE ELECTION AT WHICH THE MEASURES TO BE VOTED ON IN THIS CASE JUNE TWENTY EIGHTH. HOWEVER THE LEGISLATURE CANNOT AMEND THE PROPOSED INITIATIVE MEASURE ARE PREVENTED FROM APPEARING ON THE BALLOT. SO HERE WE ARE. I'D LIKE TO WELCOME YOU THANK OUR SPEAKERS OF THE PROPONENTS OF THE OPPONENTS FOR THEIR PRESENTATIONS TODAY. THE GOAL OF THIS HEARING IS TO HAVE A FAIR IMPARTIAL PRESENTATION OF THE RELEVANT FACTS ABOUT THIS INITIATIVE TO THE ELECTORATE. INTO A THE ELECTRIC EXCUSE ME IN REACHING AN INFORMED JUDGMENT REGARDING THIS MEASURE. SO LET'S GET STARTED AFTERNOONS WHICH I'D SAY OKAY. BUT THAT'S WILL GO AND GET STARTED WILL ASK OUR. OUR FIRST. PALESTINIAN UP AND BE RYAN WILL SEE GOING TO BE SPEAKING TO US A SENIOR BALL OF FISCAL POLICY ANALYST FROM THE LA SHOW. AND FRIEND. MARK. WE NEED CAN PROCEED WHENEVER WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU AND GOOD AFTERNOON HAD CHAIRS MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEES. AND THIS AFTERNOON WE'VE BEEN ASKED TO PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW. OF THE INITIATIVE I'LL BE SPEAKING FROM A HAND OUT. AND THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE RECEIVED. WRITTEN. AND ALL BEGIN ON. PAGE ONE OF THE HAND OUT JUST BY BRIEFLY DESCRIBING THE ROLE OF THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. IN THE INITIATIVE PROCESS. BEFORE AN INITIATIVE GOES OUT TO COLLECT SIGNATURES STATE LAW REQUIRES OUR OFFICE ALONGSIDE THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO PREPARE. AN IMPARTIAL FISCAL ANALYSIS AND OF EACH INITIATIVE. AND THIS AND ALICE THIS IS INTENDED TO PROVIDE AN ESTIMATE OF THE MEASURES FISCAL IMPACT ON STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND A SUMMARY OF THIS FISCAL IMPACT IS INCLUDED. WITH THE CIRCULATING PETITION. ONCE A MEASURE HAS RECEIVED SUFFICIENT SIGNATURES TO QUALIFY FOR THE BALLOT STATE LAW ALSO REQUIRES OUR OFFICE TO PROVIDE. IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS AND THAT GOES IN THE STATEWIDE VOTER INFORMATION GUIDE. AND THIS ANALYSIS SIMILARLY INCLUDES A DESCRIPTION. OF THE MEASURE AND IT'S PAST FISCAL AFFECTS AND WE ARE CURRENTLY IN THE PROCESS OF PREPARING THESE MATERIALS FOR INITIATIVES THAT HAVE QUALIFIED OR WHICH. HAVE A REASONABLE LIKELIHOOD OF QUALIFYING FOR THE NOVEMBER TWENTY EIGHTEEN BALLOT. SO WITH THAT BACKGROUND. ACTUALLY FIRST THOUGHT IS VERIFIED ARE WE WERE SPEAKING FIRST OF THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL INITIATIVE NOW DALLAS OKAY. MY APOLOGIES. AND WITH THAT BACKGROUND. PAPARAZZI BACKGROUND ON THE INITIATIVE. IN STAGE RENAL DISEASE ESRD IS THE FINAL STAGE OF CHRONIC KIDNEY KIDNEY FAILURE. PATIENTS SUFFERING WITH THE SRT MUST HAVE REGULAR KIDNEY DIALYSIS OR TRANSPLANT IN ORDER TO SURVIVE. AND KIDNEY DIALYSIS ALLOWS. AND FOR PATIENTS TO CONTINUE BY NOT MAKING WHAT HEALTHY KIDNEYS DO WHICH IS THE FILTER. WASTE AND TOXINS FROM THE BLOOD SUPPLY. MANY HAVE PATIENCE WITH THE AUTHORITY RECEIVED ALICE'S TREATMENT IN CHRONIC DIALYSIS CLINICS WHICH ARE LICENSED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH TO PROVIDE LESS THAN TWENTY FOUR HOUR CARE. FOR THE TREATMENT OF THE SRT PATIENTS. AND THE DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH WEBSITE CURRENTLY LISTS ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY LICENSED. CHRONIC DIALYSIS CLIP CLINICS IN THE STATE. AND WE ESTIMATE THE TOTAL RENTAL REVENUES TO THESE CLINICS TOTAL. AROUND THREE BILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY. I AM. WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE MAJORITY OF CHRONIC DIALYSIS CLINICS IN THE STATE OUR OWN AND OPERATED BY ONE OF TO. FOR PROFIT PARENT COMPANIES. DEFEAT A HEALTH CARE PARTNERS AND FOR SENIORS MEDICAL CARE. I'M ON PAGE TWO WE. DESCRIBE HOW DIALYSIS TREATMENT IS TYPICALLY PAID FOR. PAYMENT COMES FROM A FEW SOURCES TYPICALLY THE FIRST AND MOST IMPORTANT AS MEDICARE. THIS IS THE FEDERALLY FUNDED HEALTH CARE PROGRAM FOR. INDIVIDUALS AGE SIXTY FIVE AND OLDER AND ALSO SOME INDIVIDUALS WITH A CERTAIN DISABILITIES. AND MEDICARE PROVIDES COVERAGE TO ALL INDIVIDUALS WITH YES RD PROVIDED THAT THEY MEET CERTAIN WORK REQUIREMENTS. AND. AS A RESULT MEDICARE IS THE PRIMARY PAIR FOR THE MAJORITY. OF PATIENTS RECEIVING AND ALSACE TREATMENT ACRON DOUBTS CLINICS. UPON ANOTHER SIGNIFICANT PAYER FOR DIALYSIS TREATMENT IS MEDI CAL IN CALIFORNIA THIS IS. OUR VERSION OF THE MEDICAID PROGRAM AS YOU KNOW. AND THE COSTS OF THIS PROGRAM ARE SHARED BETWEEN THE FEDERAL AND STATE GOVERNMENT. AND IN MANY CASES INDIVIDUALS ARE ELIGIBLE FOR BOTH MEDICARE AND MEDICAID HOW. IN THOSE CASES MEDI CAL PICKS UP A TWENTY PERCENT SHARE OF TREATMENT COSTS. THAT OTHERWISE WOULD BE BORNE BY THE PATIENT BECAUSE THERE AND MEDI CAL MEDICARE PICKS THAT UP. IF AN INDIVIDUAL IS ELIGIBLE FOR MEDI CAL ONLY THE MEDICARE PROGRAM PAYS THE FULL COST OF DOWNSTREAM. FINALLY. SOME. ESRD PATIENTS HAVE PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE THIS COULD BE THROUGH AN EMPLOYER SPONSORED PLAN OR THROUGH AN INDIVIDUAL. PLANETS PURCHASE FOR EXAMPLE ON ON THE STATE'S ON HEALTH BENEFIT EXCHANGE. THESE INSURERS RECEIVE PREMIUM PAYMENTS FROM EMPLOYERS AND AND INDIVIDUALS AND THEN COVER AN AGREED SET UPON A AGREED UPON SET OF SERVICES AND DIALYSIS IS A COMMON. A COMMON BENEFIT IN IS IS IN FACT AN ESSENTIAL HEALTH BENEFIT UNDER UNDERSTATE STATE LAW. I'M ONE. NEW ONES THAT WILL BECOME MORE IMPORTANT LATER ON IS THAT IN SOME CASES HAVE GOVERNMENT. PROGRAMS AND GOVERNMENT AGENCIES CONTRACT WITH PRIVATE. INSURANCE COMPANIES TO PROVIDE HEALTH BENEFITS SO AN EXAMPLE OF THIS WOULD BE. AND STATE AGENCIES THAT PROVIDE HEALTH COVERAGE FOR THEIR EMPLOYEES. I'M THROUGH CALPERS FOR EXAMPLE WILL CONTRACT WITH PRIVATE INSURERS TO PROVIDE THOSE BENEFITS FOR. AND PRIVATE INSURERS IN SOME CASES CONTRACT WITH AND THE MEDICARE PROGRAM TO PROVIDE COVERAGE. IT'S ON THOSE CASES IT'S A PRIVATE ENTITY ACTING ON BEHALF OF HE GOVERNMENT. AN AGENCY OR PROGRAM. NEXT WE'LL TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE DIFFERENCES IN RATES THAT ARE PAID FOR DIALYSIS TREATMENT. GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS LIKE MEDICARE. IN MOST CASES PAY A FIXED RATE THAT'S ESTABLISHED THROUGH. REGULATION AND IN THE CASE OF MEDICARE RATES HARM ON AVERAGE ONLY SLIGHTLY EXCEED THE AVERAGE COST OF TREATMENT. MEDICARE RATES ARE DIFFICULT TO DIRECTLY COMPARE WITH MEDICARE RATES BUT OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THEY. TYPICALLY ARE ARE LOWER. PRIVATE INSURERS AND SPEAKING AGAIN ABOUT EMPLOYER SPONSORED PLANS OR OR INDIVIDUAL MARKET COVERAGE. AND THEY NEGOTIATE WITH PAYERS TO. ARRIVE AT A RATE THAT THEY'LL PAY AND THESE RATES ARE ESSENTIALLY DETERMINED BY THE RELATIVE BARGAINING. POSITION OF THE INSURERS AND THE PROVIDERS. AND ON AVERAGE INSURERS AND PAY MULTIPLE TIMES WHAT GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS PAY. FOR OUT PATIENT DATA SERVICES. NOW DESCRIBED THE MAIN PROVISIONS OF THE INITIATIVE BEGINNING ON PAGE FIVE. THE. MAIN PROVISION REQUIRES CHRONIC DIALYSIS CLINICS TO PAY REBATES TO CERTAIN PAYERS. WHEN THE CLINICS REVENUES EXCEED A CAP THAT'S EQUAL TO A HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN PERCENT. CERTAIN SPECIFIED COSTS. THOSE COSTS INCLUDE AND DIRECT PATIENT CARE SERVICES COST AND QUALITY IMPROVEMENT COSTS. SO AS AN EXAMPLE. A CLINIC WOULD BRING IN A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF REVENUE IN A CLINIC WITH SPEND A CERTAIN AMOUNT ON CALL ON ON TREATMENT AND OTHER EXPENSES IN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THOSE TWO. WOULD BE THE PROFIT TO THE CLINIC AND TWO IT'S. COMPANY THAT IT BELONGS TO IF IT IF IT DOESN'T WANT TO HAVE. A LARGER CHAIN OF OF CLINICS. AND THIS MEASURE WOULD MEASURE THAT WOULD IDENTIFY CERTAIN COSTS AND CAP REVENUES THAT HUNDRED FIFTEEN PERCENT OF THOSE COSTS. AND IF THE TOTAL REVENUES TO A CLINIC EXCEED THAT REBATES MUST BE PAID. THE MEASURE REQUIRES THAT THESE REBATE SPEAK CALCULATED AT THE. WHAT IS WAS REFERRED TO AS A GOVERNING AND ANY LEVEL? WHICH REFERS TO THE ENTITY THAT OWNS OR OPERATES THE CLINIC SO IT WOULD NOT BE A CLINIC BY CLINIC CALCULATION IT WOULD BE AT A HIGHER. SORT OF CORPORATE LEVEL. AND AND THE MEASURE PROVIDES THAT THE REBATES WOULD ONLY BE PAID TO. NON GOVERNMENT PAYERS. ANOTHER SIGNIFICANT PROVISION OF THE INITIATIVE IS THAT. THE MEASURE ENVISIONS THAT A CDC OR A GOVERNING AND IN THE MIGHT AT SOME POINT CHALLENGE THE MEASURE ON THE GROUNDS THAT IT UNCONSTITUTIONALLY. IS IT IS THE TAKING OF PRIVATE PROPERTY WITHOUT DUE PROCESS. OR JUST COMPENSATION. THE MEASURE REQUIRES THAT IF SUCH A CHALLENGE IS SUCCESSFUL AT THE CLINIC CAN DEMONSTRATE THAT IT'S AN UNCONSTITUTIONAL TAKING. THAT THE REVENUE CAPS STILL APPLIES EXCEPT THAT THE NUMBER ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN IS REPLACED WITH A HIGHER NUMBER. WHICH WOULD ALLOW A GREATER AMOUNT OF REVENUES TO BE CAPPED. SO THAT IT IS NO LONGER ON AN UNCONSTITUTIONAL TAKING AND THE BURDEN IS ON THE CLINIC. TO SUPPLY THAT. THAT ALTERNATIVE NUMBER THAT WOULD BE JUST ENOUGH TO ALLOW IT TO NOT BE AN UNCONSTITUTIONAL TAKING. FINALLY THE MEASURE. REQUIRES GOVERNING ENTITIES TO SUBMIT VARIOUS INFORMATION TO THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH EACH YEAR. RELATED TO THE REBATE REQUIREMENTS THINGS LIKE THE NUMBER OF TREATMENTS PROVIDED THE AMOUNT OF REVENUES THAT ARE BROUGHT AND THE AMOUNT OF COSTS. AND THAT. I COUNTED TOWARDS DETERMINING THE CAP AND THE AMOUNT OF REBATES THAT ARE PAID. THOSE ARE THE MAIN COMPONENTS OF THE INITIATIVE ON NOW TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT. THE MEASURES POTENTIAL IMPACTS ON CLINICS AND ON STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT FINANCES. LOOKING AT PAGE SEVEN. WE BELIEVE THAT. CHRONIC DIALYSIS CLINIC REVENUES AND IN MOST CASES EXCEED THE CAP THAT WOULD BE PUT IN PLACE BY THIS MEASURE. AND THAT IF CLINICS DID NOT CHANGE THEIR BEHAVIOR IN ANYWAY AND CONTINUED OPERATING AS THEY DO NOW. REBATES WOULD BE REQUIRED. LIKELY IN IN THE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. I AM HOWEVER THE PRECISE AMOUNT OF THE REBATES AND THE IMPACT ON CLINICS IS UNCERTAIN FOR A FEW. A FEW REASONS AM. THE AMOUNT OF THE REBATES IS SIGNIFICANT FOR CLINICS BECAUSE A LARGE AMOUNT OF REBATES COULD POTENTIALLY RESULT IN THE CLINIC. HAVING NO PROFITS HAVING LOSSES. WHERE IS A SMALLER AMOUNT OF REBATES AND MAY NOT? THE AMOUNT OF REBATES IS UNCLEAR FOR TWO MAIN REASONS NUMBER ONE THERE SEVERAL INSTANCES WHERE. IT'S I'M UNCLEAR HOW THE MEASURE WILL BE IMPLEMENTED IN PRACTICE. AND WHAT ONCE AND YOU ASSUME A CERTAIN IMPLEMENTATION OF THE MEASURE IT'S UNCLEAR HOW EXACTLY. THE CHRONIC DIALYSIS CLINICS AND THEIR GOVERNING ENTITIES WILL RESPOND. SO A LOT THROUGH SOME OF THOSE UNCERTAINTIES AND TALK ABOUT A RANGE OF POTENTIAL THINGS THAT COULD HAPPEN. ON PAGE EIGHT. THE FIRST SOURCE OF UNCERTAINTY ABOUT HOW THE MEASURE WOULD BE IMPLEMENTED RELATES TO WHICH COSTS. WOULD BE INCLUDED WHEN DETERMINING THE REVENUE CAP. INCLUDING MORE COSTS RESULTS IN HIGHER CAP. SMALLER REBATES AND RELATIVELY LESS IMPACT ON A CLINICS BOTTOM LINE. INCLUDING HAVE FEWER COSTS RESULTS IN A LOWER CAP HIGHER REBATES AND. POTENTIALLY MORE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF THE CLINIC'S OPERATIONS. AS AN EXAMPLE. THAT WHEN DEFINING DIRECT PATIENT CARE COSTS ONE OF THE MAIN CATEGORIES OF ALLOWABLE COSTS IN THE MEASURE. THE LANGUAGE AT IT SCOOTS COSTS THAT ARE RELATED TO. BECAUSE CAN ONLY BE INCLUDED IF THEY'RE FOR NON MANAGERIAL STAFF. HOWEVER THERE ARE A FEW POSITIONS THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT REQUIRES CLINICS TO MAINTAIN. IN ORDER TO GET MEDICARE REIMBURSEMENT THAT. IT'S NOT ENTIRELY CLEAR WHETHER THEY WOULD BE CONSIDERED MANAGERIAL OR NOT AND THESE ARE THE MEDICAL DIRECTOR AND THE NURSE MANAGER. THEY'RE INVOLVED IN PROVIDING DIRECT PATIENT CARE SO. ONE MIGHT THINK THAT THEY COULD BE INCLUDED AS A DIRECT PATIENT CARE COST BUT ON THE OTHER HAND THEY HAVE. AND RESPONSIBILITIES THAT THAT ARE MANAGERIAL. AND THE PROPONENTS IN THE OPPONENTS OF THE MEASURE DISAGREE. ABOUT WHETHER THE COST OF THESE PARTICULAR MANDATORY POSITIONS THAT MEDICAL DIRECTOR AND THE NURSE MANAGER. WOULD BE INCLUDED. WHEN DETERMINING THE REVENUE CAPS. A SECOND SOURCE OF UNCERTAINTY IS HOW PRIVATE INSURERS THE CONTRACT WITH GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS WOULD BE TREATED. AS WE NOTED PREVIOUSLY. REBATES CAN ONLY BE PAID TO NON GOVERNMENT PAIRS BUT. PRIVATE INSURERS THAT ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR PROVIDING CARE FOR AN INADVERTENT OF VISUAL PATIENT ON BEHALF OF A GOVERNMENT AGENCY. SUCH AS CALPERS. OR ON BEHALF OF THE MEDICARE PROGRAM. AND MAY NOT BE CONSIDERED A A GOVERNMENT PAYER. A FINAL POINT OF UNCERTAINTY IS HOW THE LEGAL PROCESS THAT WOULD ALLOW THE CAP TO BE RAISED HOW THAT WOULD WORK IN PRACTICE. OTHER STATE POLICIES THAT REGULATE PRICES THAT CAN BE CHARGED FOR GOODS AND SERVICES HAVE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESSES WHERE THE REGULATED ENTITY CAN DEMONSTRATE AND JUSTIFY THEIR COSTS. IN THIS CASE THE MEASURE DEFINES ITS REVENUE CAP BY FORMULA AND ALLOWS ADJUSTMENTS ONLY THROUGH A COURT CHALLENGE. AND WE'RE NOT AWARE OF. A SIMILAR REGULATORY SYSTEM THAT EXISTS TODAY AND AS A RESULT IT'S UNCERTAIN HOW THE PROCESS WOULD WORK IN PRACTICE AND WHAT. LEVEL OF. REBATES A COURT MIGHT CONSIDER TO BE I'M CREATING AN UNCONSTITUTIONAL TAKING. I'M IN THE CASE OF ANY PARTICULAR CLINIC OR GOVERNING ENTITY. ON PAGE TEN WE WALK THROUGH SOME OF THE POTENTIAL CLINIC RESPONSES. GIVEN ANY AND INTERPRETATION OF OF HOW THE MEASURE WOULD BE IMPLEMENTED. AND CLINICS WILL OF COURSE AND LIKELY TAKE ACTION TO MINIMIZE THE AMOUNT OF REBATES THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO PAY SO'S TO. CONTINUE THEIR OPERATIONS. THERE A FEW POSSIBLE RESPONSES THAT COULD COME ABOUT TO ACHIEVE THIS NUMBER ONE THE CLINICS COULD MODIFY THEIR COST STRUCTURES. AND. IF A CLINIC. REDUCES COSTS THAT ARE NOT COUNTED TOWARDS REVENUE CAP THEY CAN KEEP THE SAME AMOUNT OF REVENUE. BUT THOSE REVENUES ARE NOTED AGAINST A SMALLER AMOUNT OF COSTS RESULTING IN. MORE MORE PROFIT. ALTERNATIVELY A CLINIC MAY HAVE LESS INCENTIVE TO. LIMIT COSTS THAT DO COUNT TOWARDS THE CAP SINCE. HAVING ADDITIONAL COSTS AND ALLOWS REVENUES TO RISE. AND ORDINARILY I HAVE A COMPANY WOULD TRY AND LIMIT ITS COSTS. GIVEN THE AMOUNT OF REVENUES BUT IN THIS CASE INCREASING YOUR COSTS ALLOWS YOU TO HAVE GREATER REVENUES THAN YOU WOULD HAVE OTHERWISE. IN SOME CASES HAVE CLINICS MAY CHOOSE TO LOWER THE RATES THAT THEY CHARGE. TO PAYERS IN PARTICULAR. PRIVATE INSURANCE SO AS TO AVOID HAVING TO PAY REBATES. AND IF. A CLINIC. OR ITS GOVERNING AND HE BELIEVES THAT IT CANNOT ACHIEVE A REASONABLE RETURN AFTER MAKING THOSE KINDS OF ADJUSTMENTS THAT MIGHT SEEK RELIEF. THROUGH THE LEGAL PROCESS AND. IF THESE CHALLENGES PROCEED IS THE MEASURE OUTLINES THEY COULD RECEIVE A HIGHER CAPITAL WHILE THEM TO. TO CONTINUE OPERATING THAT WAY. AND FINALLY. IN SOME CASES THAT REDUCED REVENUES UNDER THE REBATE PROVISIONS. COULD RESULT IN. CLINICS CLOSING GOVERNING ENTITIES CHOOSING NOT TO OPEN AS MANY CLINICS. IF IF THEY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH. RETURNED TO JUSTIFY THEIR CONTINUING IN THE MARKET. WHICH BEHAVIOR RESPONSE CLINICS CHOOSE TO TAKE HOW WILL DEPEND IN PART ON HOW IT'S IMPLEMENTED HOW THE MEASURES IMPLEMENTED IF THE MEASURE IS IMPLEMENTED IN. A BROADER WAY THAT. ALLOWS OF A WIDER RANGE OF COSTS ACCOUNT IN DETERMINING THAT REVENUE CAP. THE MEASURE IS LESS LIKELY TO NEGATIVELY IMPACT. CLINICS VIABILITY AND CLINICS ARE MORE LIKELY TO TAKE THE FIRST TWO BEHAVIORAL RESPONSES WHERE THEY WILL ADJUST THEIR OPERATIONS TO MITIGATE THE EFFECT. OF OF THE REBATES. ON THE OTHER HAND IF THE MEASURE IS IMPLEMENTED WITH A MORE NARROW DEFINITION OF COSTS. AND REVENUE CAPS ARE LOWER REBATES ARE MORE SIGNIFICANT. IT'S MORE LIKELY THAT. CLINICS ONGOING OPERATIONS WILL BE WILL BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED AND THEY MAY BE MORE LIKELY TO SEEK ADJUSTMENTS TO THE REVENUE CAP. OR TO SCALE BACK THEIR OPERATIONS. TO WRAP THIS ALL UP ON PAGE TWELVE WE TALK ABOUT. AND THE POTENTIAL FISCAL EFFECTS ON STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FROM THIS MEASURE. I GIVEN THE UNCERTAINTY THAT WE'VE DESCRIBED THERE IS A RANGE OF POSSIBLE OUTCOMES. AND AGAIN GOING BACK TO A BROAD INTERPRETATION OF THE MEASURE IF THE REVENUE CAPS ARE RELATIVELY HIGHER BECAUSE MORE COSTS ARE COUNTED. AND AND IF CLINICS ARE ABLE TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS IN THEIR OPERATIONS TO. GIVE THEM A SUFFICIENT RETURN TO WANT TO CONTINUE OPERATING. OR THEY'RE ABLE TO ACHIEVE HIGHER REVENUE CAP THROUGH THE COURT PROCESS. AND IT'S POSSIBLE THAT CLINICS WILL CONTINUE AS THEY DO TODAY. BUT THERE WILL BE LOWER I POTENTIALLY LOWER PRICES AND PAID BY PRIVATE INSURERS. IF THAT SCENARIO PLAYS OUT THESE INSURERS MAY PASS ON. A PORTION OF THIS POUND. THAT THEY RECEIVE. AND PAYING LOWER RATES TO STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES. AND THE FORMER REDUCE PREMIUMS. THE AMOUNT OF THESE POTENTIAL SAVINGS IS IS UNCERTAIN. BUT COULD BE AS MUCH AS THE ONE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ANNUALLY. ON THE OTHER HAND IF THERE IS A MORE NARROW INTERPRETATION OF WHAT COSTS ARE DETERMINED TO BE ALLOWABLE. AND CLINICS. HAVE. ARE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED IN AND HAVE. IF THE MEASURE NEGATIVELY IMPACTS THE ONGOING VIABILITY OF THE CLINICS. THERE COULD BE FEWER NEW CLINICS OPENING OR SOME CLINICS CLOSING. WHICH COULD RESULT IN SOME ESRD PATIENTS RECEIVING DIALYSIS IN NON CLINIC SETTING SUCH AS HOSPITALS. WHICH. ARE GOING TO BE MORE EXPENSIVE THIS WOULD RESIST RESULT IN STATE COSTS IN MEDICARE HOW. AND. ALSO COSTS FOR STATE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. THAT PROVIDE HEALTH BENEFITS TO THEIR EMPLOYEES. AND THE AMOUNT OF THESE POTENTIAL COSTS IS UNCERTAIN BUT THEY COULD BE SIGNIFICANT. THAT WOULD BE MORE SHORT RUN ROTH SHORT RUN EFFECT IN THE LONGER RUN TIME WE EXPECT THE BROADER ADJUSTMENTS IN THE DIALYSIS INDUSTRY. AND POTENTIALLY CHANGES TO HOW THE MEASURE'S PROVISIONS ARE IMPLEMENTED SUCH AS THROUGH REGULATORY CHANGES. JUDICIAL ACTION OR LEGISLATIVE ACTION AND WHICH IS ALLOWED TO FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE MEASURE. WOULD TEND TO REDUCE THE HIGHER COSTS OVER TIME. AND THAT WE DO NOT ALSO THAT. THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH WOULD HAVE INCREASED COSTS. IN THE LOAN MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ASSOCIATED WITH ADMINISTERING THIS. MEASURE THESE WOULD BE COVERED BY INCREASED FEES PAID BY CLINICS. OVERALL BASED ON THE INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE REVIEWED TO DATE. AND IN LIGHT OF THE SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY ABOUT HOW VARIOUS PROVISIONS OF THE MEASURE WOULD BE IMPLEMENTED AND HOW CLINICS WOULD RESPOND. THE NET FISCAL IMPACT ON STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IS UNCLEAR. AND THAT CONCLUDES OUR OVERVIEW AND WE WOULD BE HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE AT THIS TIME. QUESTIONS FROM THE DICE. THEY HAVE BEEN QUESTIONS. I DO I DO HAVE I DO HAVE ONE YOU TALKED ABOUT TALK ABOUT A SORT OF A GLOBAL. PERCENTAGE. OF. AMOEBA NETWORK. A PROFIT. GLOBAL PROFIT SO IT IT WOULD NOT BE AT NECESSARILY THAT IT'S NOT NECESSARILY THE INDIVIDUAL CLINIC LEVEL IT'S AT THE. PARENT PART OF THE CORRECT IS A DANGER OF THAT. SO IT'S POSSIBLE INDIVIDUAL CLINICS COULD OPERATE AT A LOSS. SO THE IMPACT. TO COMMUNITY COULD. TO ME THAT'S HOW. IF YOU GIVE ANY THOUGHT TO HOW HOW THE INDUSTRY MIGHT RESPOND AND THAT WE REQUEST ON HOW TO IS HOW THE INDUSTRY RESPOND IF SOMETHING'S INDIVIDUAL CLINICS ACTUALLY DO OPERATE OUT A LOT. BASED ON THIS NEW FORMULA THAT'S CORRECT AND THE THE REBATES WOULD BE CALCULATED AT THE GOVERNING AND ANY LEVEL AND THAT MEANS THAT WITHIN A GOVERNING AND ANY THERE COULD BE SOME CLINICS THAT DO BETTER THAN OTHERS. THE REBATES WOULD BE DETERMINED. ON AGGREGATE AND IN FACT TODAY. WITHIN GOVERNING ENTITIES WITHIN THESE. THESE GROUPS OF CLINICS ARE CLINICS TO OPERATE AT A LOSS NOW. AND FOR VARIOUS REASONS IT COULD BE BECAUSE THE CLINIC IS JUST STARTING UP HAS RECEIVED A CERTIFICATION TO GET MEDICARE. REIMBURSEMENT AND THINGS LIKE THAT AND THE CLINIC WILL ESSENTIALLY SUBSIDIZE THAT THE PARENT AND AND ANY WILL SUBSIDIZE THE OPERATIONS OF THAT CLINIC WITH. WITH THE OTHER CLINICS AND SO IN TERMS OF HOW THAT COULD AFFECT. GOVERNING ANY BEHAVIOR. IT IS TRUE THAT IF YOU HAVE FOUND. CERTAIN CLINICS IN A GOVERNING AND IF YOU WERE DOING WELL ENOUGH TO SUBSIDIZE OTHERS THAT COULD ALLOW. SOME CLINICS TO CONTINUE OPERATIONS. HOWEVER. COMPANIES ARE LIKELY TO MAKE CHOICES THAT WILL ALLOW THEM TO MAXIMIZE. THERE. THEY'RE RETURNS AM GIVEN THE THAT THE FRAMEWORK THAT THEY'RE OPERATING IN AND WE STILL COULD SEE SITUATIONS WHERE A GOVERNING AND HE CHOOSES TO CLOSE. THE LOWEST PERFORMING CLINICS TO. ACHIEVE ON MARGINAL IMPROVEMENT AND IN THEIR RETURNS. ANY ANYONE ELSE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THAT. SEE NO LESS SUFFERS OUR FIRST PANEL TO COME UP. HAVE FOR. THE PROPONENTS I'M SORRY IT SHOULD QUESTIONS MADE THAT CLEAR I'M SORRY I KNOW THAT'S WHAT OKAY LET'S GO AHEAD WHAT DISTURBED WE HAVE ABOUT FIVE TO SEVEN MINUTES REACH. PERSONS PRESENT. SO WHENEVER WHENEVER YOU'RE READY PLEASE. GREAT THAT. THANK YOU FOR. HEARING US OUT TODAY. MY NAME IS MAGELLAN HANFORD. I'M A DIALYSIS NURSE. I'VE BEEN A DIALYSIS NURSE FOR OVER SEVENTEEN YEARS. AND I'VE SEEN THE INDUSTRY'S PROBLEMS UP CLOSE. I'VE SEEN PATIENTS BLEEDING OUT IN THE PARKING LOT. AND THE BATHROOMS. AND AS A RETIRED LOS ANGELES AREA POLICE OFFICER. THESE SITUATIONS THAT REMIND ME OF DIFFERENT CRIME SCENES. NOW I'M HERE TESTIFYING TODAY BECAUSE DIALYSIS PATIENT CARE IS IN A CRISIS FOR THE SIXTY SIX THOUSAND. BALLOTS IS PATIENTS HERE IN CALIFORNIA. WHOSE KIDNEYS HAVE A FAILED THEM. AND THEY RELY ON BALLOTS IS TO STAY ALIVE. NOW EVEN AS A AS A PATIENT CARE SUFFERS. PALACES CORPORATE PROFITS. ARE OUT OF CONTROL. AND THEY'RE OVERCHARGING DRIVES UP HEALTHCARE COSTS FOR ALL OF US. PATIENTS HAVE REPORTED BLOODSTAINS* ROACHES. RATS AND CLINICS STAFFING LEVELS FOR PATIENT CARE TECHNICIAN'S ONE THE TWELFTH. WANT ONE TECHNICIAN TO TWELVE PATIENTS. NURSES TWENTY FOUR NURSES. I'M A TWENTY ONE ONE NURSE FOR TWENTY FOUR PATIENTS. AND WHEN PATIENTS ON ABLE TO. GET TO STAFF MEMBERS ATTENTION THEIR LIVES COULD BE AT RISK. SO WIERD ALICE'S CORPORATION PUTTING PATIENTS LIVES IN DANGER. FOR ONE OF THE WORST. AND MOST ON DEFENSIBLE REASONS OF LAW. SO THEY CAN MAKE BILLIONS IN PROFITS HOW PEOPLE HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO GET THEIR TREATMENT IN THEIR CLINICS. NOW THE DIALYSIS INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA IS DOMINATED BY TWO COMPANIES. THE VITA EFFORTS ENNIUS. WHO OWN AND OPERATE SEVENTY TWO PERCENT? OF THE CLINICS AND THIS STATE. THESE COMPANIES ARE MAKING A MASSIVE PROFITS THAT COULD OTHERWISE BE SPENT ON THAT TREATING PATIENTS WITH THIS DEADLY DISEASE. THE PROFIT MARGIN OF THEIR DIALYSIS CLINIC IS NEARLY FIVE TIMES HIGHER THAN THE AVERAGE HOSPITAL HERE IN CALIFORNIA. THAT MEANS BIG MONEY. PROFITS UP FROM THEIR U. S. DIALYSIS OPERATIONS TOTALED THREE POINT NINE BILLION DOLLARS IN TWENTY SIXTEEN. THAT'S BILLIONSAND THAT'S WHAT THE BE. NOW MOST CORPORATIONS WOULD CONSIDER FIFTEEN PRINT PERCENT PROFIT THAT WE TURN. BUT THESE COMPANIES HAVE BEEN SAYING AND I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT THEY WILL SAY THIS HERE TODAY. THATLIMITING THEM TO A FIFTEEN PERCENT PROFIT MARGIN. NOT THAT THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY PERCENT MARGIN THAT THEY OFTEN GET FROM PRIVATE INSURANCE. WILL CAUSE THEM TO CLOSE CLINICS AND RESULT IN THE DEATH OF PATIENTS. NOW THE ONLY REASON THEY WERE CLOSE CLINICS IS BECAUSE THESE CORPORATIONS CHOOSE TO. NOT BECAUSE THEY'RE FORCED TO. TO ME AS A DIALYSIS NURSE FOR OVER SEVENTEEN YEARS. SUCH A HEARTLESS AND CALISTO AT THE CLOSE CLINICS AND PUT LIVES AT RISK. S. POSES WHO THESE CORPORATIONS REALLY ARE. AND WHAT THEY REALLY CARE ABOUT. AND LET'S BE CLEAR ITS PROFITS. FOR MONTHS THEY HAVE REPEATED OUT LOUD FOR THE WHOLE WORLD TO HEAR. THAT IF THEY CAN'T MAKE THESE UP ST UP PROFITS. BOB THIS TERRIBLE TERMINAL ILLNESS. THEY WILL CLOSE CLINICS AND PEOPLE WILL DIE. THIS INITIATIVE WILL BRING SOME MUCH NEEDED SANITY IMBALANCE TO THIS INDUSTRY. WHICH DESPITE HUGE PROFITS IT'S PUTTING PATIENTS THE REST OF UNNECESSARY COMPLICATIONS AND EVEN DEATHS. ON A DAILY BASIS. WE DESERVE BETTER. CALIFORNIA'S DESERVE BETTER. THE FAIR PRICING FOR DIALYSIS ACT WILL BE ON THE BALLOT NOVEMBER OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN. AND IT WILL HELP IMPROVE PATIENT LIVES. AND LOWER HEALTHCARE COSTS FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. BY LINKING REVENUE TO CARE THEN ISSUE PROVIDES A STRONG INCENTIVE FOR THE DALLAS IS CORPORATIONS TO INVEST MORE AND DIRECT PATIENT CARE. SUCH AS STAFFING. NEW EQUIPMENT. AND IMPROVE FACILITIES. THESE INVESTMENTS CAN RESTORE SOME OF THE DIGNITY TO THE PATIENT'S LIVES. AND REDUCE THE RISK OF INFECTIONS WHICH WE WE WE BELIEVE. WILL ALSO EXPAND PATIENT LIVES. BY STOPPING THESE COMPANIES FROM OVERCHARGING WE ALSO WILL BRING DOWN THE COST OF HEALTHCARE INSURANCEPREMIUMS FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. THE FAIR PRICING FOR DIALYSIS ACT HAS BROAD PUBLIC SUPPORT. WE'VE COLLECTED NEARLY SIX HUNDRED THOUSANDS OF VOTER SIGNATURES. AND THAT'S MORE THAN ENOUGH TO PLACE IT ON THE NOVEMBER TWENTY EIGHTEEN BALLOT. MANY STATE ORGANIZATIONS SUPPORT THE MEASURE. PATIENTS HEALTHCARE ADVOCATES COMMUNITY GROUPS CHARGERS. AND LABOR UNIONS. MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED ORGANIZATIONS SO FOR HAVE JOINED THE CAMPAIGN. NOW COME NOVEMBER THE SIX CALIFORNIAS WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE A STAND TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF CARE AND ALICE'S CLINICS. AND LOWER HEALTHCARE COSTS FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. NOW THE DIALYSIS NURSE. I GOTTA TELL YA I CAN'T WAIT TO VOTE FOR THIS. THANK YOU. YOU OPENLY WAS RELUCTANT LISTA. I AM ALSO ADELE OF SPEAKING I BEEN ANALYSIS BY LAST PAST EIGHT YEARS. PRETTY SOON UP BEYOND NINE YEARS THIS COMING JANUARY THE TWENTY FIFTH. I EVER STATE MERE. DID I ACTUALLY. ON MY LIFE ABOUT BEING ON DIALYSIS. WHICH ARE CC HERE'S SKINNER READ FOR ME BECAUSE MY. EYESIGHT IS NOT TOO GOOD BECAUSE BLOOM FROM ON. DIABETES AND ALICE'S. HELLO GOOD AFTERNOON. MY NAME IS ACTUALLY CECILIA GOMEZ GONZALEZ. AND MIKE BOTH OF MY PARENTS WORD DIALYSIS PATIENTS AS WELL. BUT AS. ON BEHALF OF ROBERT. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS ROBERTO ACOSTA. I LIVE IN APPOINTED. A CITY IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY AND I'VE BEEN THE DALES PATIENT FOR EIGHT YEARS. BEFORE MY KIDNEYS FAILED I WAS A TRUCK DRIVER FOR FORTY YEARS AND LEVY AND LEFT GOLFING. HIKING DIRT BIKE GRADING AND HUNTING. BUT I CAN'T DO THOSE THINGS ANYMORE. INSTEAD EVERY MONDAY. WEDNESDAY. FRIDAY. I'M IN TREATMENT AT THE DALLAS CLINIC. GRUELING. BUT IT'S WHAT I HAVE TO DO TO SURVIVE. I SPENT MUCH OF THE OTHER DAYS RECOVERING. DIALYSIS IS AN EXHAUSTING PROCESS THAT REMOVES MY BLOOD. CLEANS IT AND RETURNS IT TO MY BODY. EACH SESSION LASTS ABOUT THREE TO FOUR HOURS. I STARTED DIALYSIS IN TWENTY TEN. TWENTY TEN AT A CLINIC IN IRWINDALE. AND OVER THE NEXT SIX YEARS I COMPLAIN MULTIPLE TIMES. ABOUT POOR CONDITIONS BUT LITTLE WAS DONE. DURING FOUR SESSIONS IN TWENTY FIFTEEN I SAW FLIES ENTERED THE FACILITY THROUGH THE DOOR. THE FLIES WOULD HOOK OVER AND LAND ON PATIENTS INCLUDING ME. DURING TREATMENT WE ARE CONNECTED TO TO BEING WHICH MADE IT DIFFICULT TO SHOO THE FLIES AWAY. I ALSO SAW COCKROACHES SCURRYING ACROSS THE FLOOR. THAT CLINIC AND. HAD A. HAD SPIDERS CRAWL UP MY ARMS. CLINIC STAFF. SAID THAT EXTERMINATOR SPRAYED ONCE A MONTH BUT I KEPT SEEN THEM AND I COULDN'T DO ANYTHING BECAUSE. I WAS IN A VULNERABLE POSITION HOOKED UP TO A DIALYSIS MACHINE. THE RUSSIANS AT THE CLINIC WORK UNSANITARY. THERE WAS OFTEN YEAR IN ON THE TOILETS AND FLOOR. WASTE BASKETS WERE OVERFLOWING WITH PAPER TOWELS AND OTHER TRASH. I COMPLAINED AND WAS ASSURED THAT MAINTENANCE CLEAN THE RESTROOMS EVERYDAY BUT IT SURE DIDN'T LOOK THAT WAY TO ME. BEING TREATED IN THESE CONDITIONS WAS FRIGHTENED BECAUSE I CAN EASILY GET AN INFECTION. FROM WHERE THE TUBING IS INSERTED IN MY BODY AND I END UP IN THE HOSPITAL. AFTER SIX YEARS I LEFT FOR A DIFFERENT CLINIC. I AM GRATEFUL TO BE GONE BUT I KNOW THAT ORINDA CLINIC WAS NOT AN EXCEPTION BASED ON WHAT OTHER PATIENTS HAVE TOLD ME. WE DESERVE BETTER AND THAT'S WHY I'M SUPPORTING THE FAIR PRICING FOR DIALYSIS ACT. WE NEED TO IMPROVE PATIENT CARE BY INVESTING MORE IN STAFF BEING EQUIPMENT AND FACILITIES. DIALYSIS IS NOT A CHOICE FOR ME. THIS IS A LIFE OR DEATH SITUATION. AS MUCH AS MY BODY IS IN PAIN FROM DIALYSIS. I KEEP GOING BECAUSE MY CHILDREN AND MY GRANDKIDS. I LOVE SEEING THEM HAPPY AND PLAYING TOGETHER AND I'M STAYING ALIVE FOR THEM. I DON'T BELIEVE THE CORPORATIONS THAT OWN THESE CLINICS CARE ABOUT MY LIFE. OR MY STRUGGLE TO SURVIVE. I DON'T BELIEVE THEY GIVE ME A SECOND THOUGHT. TO THEM I AM JUST A NUMBER ON A SPREADSHEET AND THEY'RE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF ME. THIS BAD BALLOT MEASURE WILL HELP REVERSE THAT. IT MAY NOT MAKE THE PEOPLE WHO PROFIT FROM MY ILLNESS SEEN ME AS A REAL PERSON WITH FEELINGS AND THE FAMILY. BUT IT WILL FORCE THEM TO TREAT ME AND MY FELLOW PATIENTS BETTER. AND FOR NOW THAT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME. THANK YOU. BLOOM. I'M PASSED AWAY EMPTY SMART JUNIOR. PRESIDENT AND CEO OF THE SOUTHERN CHRISTIAN LEADERSHIP CONFERENCE OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. THE ORGANIZATION THAT DOCTOR MARTIN LUTHER KING JUNIOR FOUND IT AND IN FACT HE FOUND THAT THE ONE. THAT I'M THE PRESIDENT OF IN LOS ANGELES. I'M HERE TODAY BECAUSE AS DOCTOR KING OFTEN CAME TO SITUATIONS. THERE'S AN INJUSTICE HERE. IN FACT DR KING STATED ALL OF ALL THE FORMS OF BEEN IN THE QUALITY. INJUSTICE IN THE HEALTH CARE. IS THE MOST SHOCKING IN INHUMANE HE SAID THAT IN NINETEEN SIXTY SIX. AT THE MEDICAL COMMISSION FOR HUMAN RIGHTS. I'VE WATCHED AND I'VE LISTEN AND I'VE VISITED I'VE SEEN IN MY PAST STORY. CAREER OF OVER FIFTY YEARS. AND IRAQ'S I'M ONLY FIFTY EIGHT SO I STARTED AT EIGHT YEARS OLD. LOOKING AT JACK AND JUSTICE IN FIGHTING FOR PEOPLE WHO COULDN'T FIGHT FOR THEMSELVES. YOU WERE HERE TODAY BECAUSE THEY ARE PEOPLE WHO CAN'T FIGHT FOR THEMSELVES. EVEN THOUGH WE'VE HEARD THE VOICES OF SOME OF THEM TODAY AND THEY'VE GOT SO MANY SIGNATURES. BUT THERE ARE GOING UP AGAINST A GOOD LIE. IN THE INDUSTRY THIS SEEMINGLY DOESN'T CARE ABOUT THE COMMENT BROTHER AND SISTER WHO STRUGGLES EVERY DAY. THIRTY SIX PERCENT OF. THE DIALYSIS PATIENTS AND ARE AFRICAN AMERICANS IN EVEN THOUGH THEY ONLY MAKE UP TWELVE WE ONLY MAKE UP TWELVE PERCENT OF THE POPULATION. THESE PATIENTS GOAL. OF ALL COLORS IN ALL RACES GOAL TO UNLOCK. THE GOAL INTO THESE CLINICS. PATIENTS ARE THERE BECAUSE THEY'RE VERY SICK. THEY NEEDS TO GET DIALYSIS THREE AND FOUR TIMES A WEEK JUST TO STAY ALIVE. THEIR CONDITIONS MAKES THEM PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE SWIM FACTION IN OTHER ILLNESSES. THESE CLINICS OR SOME OF THE NASTIEST AND DIRTIEST ONES IN THE COUNTRY. TOO MANY OF THEM FACE SUB STANDARD CONDITIONS IN THESE COME TO THESE CLINICS WHEN THEY GO THERE FOR TREATMENT. AS YOU'VE HEARD. PATIENTS AND CAREGIVERS REPORT INSTANCES ABOVE THE BLOODSTAINS SO OFTEN THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH STAFF. TO PROPERLY CARE FOR THEM WHEN I TOOK A MEMBER OF MY CHURCH TO A. TO A HOSPITAL'S DIALYSIS THERE WERE TWO PEOPLE WATCHING OVER THEM CONTRA CONSTANTLY I'VE HEARD REPORTS IN THESE THAT SOMETIMES THERE'S ONE PERSON ONE CAREGIVER RESPONSIBLE FOR THREE OF FOUR PEOPLE. THAT'S AWFUL. SO OFTEN THAT HAPPENS IMPATIENCE ARE NOT TREATED FAIRLY. SO WE'RE HERE BECAUSE AN INJUSTICE IS HERE. WE'RE HERE BECAUSE WE WANT TO CHANGE THIS AND WE'RE HOPING TO THE FAIR PRICING FOR DIALYSIS IS THAT. THAT THAT WOULD MAKE A CHANGE A VERY IMPORTANT CHAINS THE INDUSTRY HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO IT. BUT THEY DIDN'T DO IT SO NOW WE THE PEOPLE HAVE SPOKEN IN NOVEMBER SIX WE'RE GOING TO PROVE SO THIS INDUSTRY HOW THEY MISSED AN OPPORTUNITY TO WORK TOGETHER WITH US. WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THEM BECAUSE THEY PUT MONEY BEFORE MORALITY FINANCES BEFORE FAMILY DARLA'S BEFORE DECENCY PROFIT BEFORE PEOPLE EARNINGS BEFORE ETHICS INCOME BEFORE INDIVIDUALS SO WHERE HERE THE DAY THE SAME. WE ARE NOT GOING TO TAKE THIS ANYMORE WHERE YOU BELIEVE IN THESE PEOPLE AND ARE PEOPLE GETTING A FAIR HEARING IN THE FAIR OPPORTUNITY EVERY TIME THEY WALK INTO. THANK YOU. JOHN ALLEN HERE TO ANSWER TO. AFTER THAT I OKAY. IF YOU THINK YOU. I DO HAVE A COUPLE. QUESTIONS IN THEIR TECH. GOING GOING TOWARD YOU JEFF. THERE'S. I THINK WAS BROUGHT UP IN THE ALLEY OWES ANNOUNCES SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT. YOU KNOW DEFINITIONS AROUND NON MANAGERIAL CHRONIC. PRODUCT AYE CHRONIC DIALYSIS. A CLINIC STAFF. OUR MEDICAL CONSIDERED A MEDICAL DIRECTORS CONSIDERED ADMINISTRATORS. AND DO THIS MEDICAL TRYING UNDERSTAND WHAT THE INTENT IS SO THE INTENT OF THE MEDICAL DIRECTORS ARE INCLUDED IN THE DEFINITION OF PATIENT CARE. AND FOR US THAT WAS MADE INCREDIBLY CLEAR. WHEN WE USE THE AMENDMENT PROCESS. OF THE INITIATIVE BECAUSE INITIALLY WE HEADS EXPLICITLY EXCLUDED MEDICAL DIRECTORS. BUT BASED ON FEEDBACK DURING THE AMENDMENT PROCESS WE STRUCK THOSE. OF STRUCK THAT MENTION OF MEDICAL DIRECTORS BEING EXCLUDED. SO. BOTH. BY THE INTENT AND ALSO WE WOULD SAY THAT BY THAT DEFINITION THE MEDICAL DIRECTOR IS NOT AN EMPLOYEE OF THE CLINIC. OF. THEY ARE THEY'RE AN EXTERNAL MEDICAL DIRECTOR. OF AND SO WE ARE CONFIDENT THAT A READING OF THE THE INTENT AND THE INITIATIVE LANGUAGE WOULD INCLUDE MEDICAL DIRECTORS SO WITH THOSE SALARIES AND INCLUDED IN THE GLOBAL CAPTAIN YES. OKAY. AND TO YOU AND YOU KNOW HOW MUCH ON AVERAGE. PRIVATE INSURERS PAY FOR DIALYSIS. AND MEDI CAL. AND MEDICARE. SO PRIVATE INSURANCE PAYS ME SAKE APPROXIMATELY A THOUSAND DOLLARS. BASED ON THE DIFFERENT CONTRACTS. MEDICARE ROUGHLY TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS. AND MEDI CAL SOMEWHAT LOWER. SO THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THAT COMMERCIAL AND THAT MEDICARE RATE. IS SUBSTANTIALLY LARGER THAN WE SEE IN MANY OTHER COMMERCIAL HEALTH CARE FEELS. FOR MEDI CAL IS LESS THAN TWO HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS YEAH BUT MEDICARE PAYS. AND YOU HAPPEN TO KNOW HOW MANY PATIENTS ARE PRIVATE PAY IN OF THE SIXTY SIX THOUSAND PATIENTS HOW MANY ARE PRIVATE PAPERS IS. THOSE THAT ARE ON MEDI CAL AND MEDICARE. THE ROUGH BREAKDOWN IS THAT IT'S APPROXIMATELY EIGHTY PERCENT MEDICARE. DIALYSIS IS A CARVE INTO MEDICARE EVEN FOR PATIENTS WHO ARE UNDER SIXTY FIVE NOT DISABLED. SO THE VAST MAJORITY PATIENTS ARE ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICARE. THERE'S ROUGHLY. TEN PERCENT. MEDIC HAL. AND THEN ROUGHLY TEN PERCENT COMMERCIAL. THOSE NUMBERS FLUCTUATE SOME EACH YEAR. AND THEN HOW HOW DID HOW DID YOU COME UP WITH WHAT YOU CONSIDER FAIR AND REASONABLE PAYMENT. WE LOOKED TO THE ACA. RATIO IN THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. THAT REGULATES WHAT IS CONSIDERED A FAIR AND REASONABLE ADMINISTRATIVE AND PROFIT. FOR GROUP HEALTH PLANS. THEN THE RATIO THERE IS CITED EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT PATIENT CARE AND FIFTEEN PERCENT ADMINISTRATIVE AND PROFIT. SO. WE BASED IT AROUND THAT ACA FRAMEWORK FOR HEALTH PLANS. SO YOU'VE YOU'VE ESSENTIALLY. TREATED SO YOU'RE LOOKING AT AS AS IF. ONE OF THESE COMPANIES IS A HEALTH PLAN. IT WAS MORE THAT THAT THAT THAT LANGUAGE THAT THAT RATIO AND THAT FRAMEWORK HAD ALREADY BEEN. INVESTIGATED ITEMS TESTED IN THE ACA AND SO AS WE WERE LOOKING TO WHAT IS THAT RIGHT NUMBER. DO WE AND TWO WE GO WITH SOMETHING LIKE A. OF PERCENTAGE OF ABOVE MEDICARE OR PERCENTAGE OF MEDI CAL. OR COST BASED AND SEEING THE ACA'S FRAMEWORK OF THAT COST BASED. OF. AS. OPERATING WELL IN THE CA. AND REALLY SEEING THAT. A SUCCESSFUL MODEL WE LOOKED TO EXTENDED DOWN AND WHAT IS THIS VERY UNIQUE INDUSTRY. WITHIN HEALTH CARE FOR THERE IS SUCH MARKET CONSOLIDATION SUCH MONOPOLY. TO TREATED A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY THAN THE REST OF HEALTH CARE SO HAS THAT BEEN EXPLORED ANYWHERE ELSE OTHER MEANS OTHER THAN THROUGH THIS INITIATIVE OR THROUGH THIS. THROUGH THIS APPROACH BECAUSE I BUT NOT I'M GONNA MOMENT I'M ASKING JUST CURIOUS BECAUSE I AM NOT AWARE THAT. THAT THIS. HAS BEEN APPLIED TO OTHER AND IN ANY OTHER STATE SO IS THIS IS THIS UNIQUE IT'S FAIRLY NOVEL APPROACH WITHIN. WITH INTO ALICE'S IN PARTICULAR BUT IT IS. IT DOES ALSO. MIRROR TO SOME EXTENT THE WAY THAT WE ADDRESS OTHER MONOPOLIES AND OTHER HIGHLY CONCENTRATED INDUSTRIES. FOR EXAMPLE SOMETHING LIKE. A PROFIT SETTING REGIME WITHIN A UTILITY. OR OTHER MONOPOLY ARE HIGHLY CONCENTRATED MARKETS BUT WITHIN A HEALTH CARE WITHIN A DIALYSIS. INDUSTRY THIS IS FAIRLY UNIQUE MODEL SO FAR. WE'RE LOOKING FOR TO SPREAD TO OTHER STATES. AND. OF. MY MISTER MAKES PERSON. IT DOESN'T THOSE NUMBERS WERE INTERESTING ABOUT THAT RELEASE ONLY TEN PERCENT PRIVATE PAYERS SO IF EIGHTY PERCENT IS MEDICARE TEN PERCENT IS MEDI CAL THE OTHER TEN PERCENT SO. HOW WILL LIMITING WHAT INSURANCE COMPANIES PAY HOW IS THAT GOING TO BOMB IMPROVE CARE FOR? DIALYSIS PATIENTS. SO. THE WAY THAT. THE WEIGHT THE INITIATIVE IS SET UP. IS THAT DIALYSIS. COMPANIES APTLY AT THE CORPORATE LEVEL. WOULD BE ABLE TO ADD TOGETHER ALL OF THEIR PATIENT CARE COST. SO WHETHER THAT PATIENT CARE EXPENSE WAS ON BEHALF OF A MEDI CAL PATIENT OR ON BEHALF OF THE COMMERCIAL PATIENT. THOSE WOULD ALL GO INTO THE SAME COOL OF PATIENT CARE COST. AND THAT WOULD BE COMPARED TO A POOL OF REVENUE. AGAIN FROM COMMERCIAL PATIENTS PAYERS AS WELL AS GOVERNMENT PAYERS. AND THEN IF THAT REVENUE EXCEEDS THE PATIENT CARE COST BY MORE THAN FIFTEEN PERCENT. THAT WOULD TRIGGER THE REBATES SO WHAT IT ACTUALLY DOES IS CREATE THE INCENTIVE. FOR DIALYSIS CLINICS TO TREAT MEDI CAL AND MEDICARE PATIENTS. THE EXACT SAME WAY THAT THEY TREAT COMMERCIAL PATIENTS BE BECAUSE THEY'LL GET EVERY DOLLAR THEY INVEST. IN A PATIENT'S CARE. WHETHER THAT PATIENTS MEDICAL OF MEDICARE OR COMMERCIAL WILL GO TO RAISE THEIR OVERALL CAP. A. STRIP STRUGGLING WITH ECONOMICS THAT A LITTLE BIT DOWN. SO WILL ONE OF THE STATED GOALS OF THE INITIATIVES THE FORCED ALICE'S CLINICS TO HIRE MORE WORKERS. SOMEHOW WILL CLINICS BE ABLE TO DO THAT IF THEY'RE CAP ON COSTS. NOTHING CREE IN INITIATIVE CREATES A CAP ON COSTS. A BONE. IF AS THE COSTS RISE AS THEY HIRE ANOTHER NURSE AS THEY. STAFF BETTER. BY YOU BY NEW SUPPLIES EXPAND TO NEW CLINICS. THAT WOULD MEAN THAT THERE THAT THE REVENUE THAT THEY CAN KEEP AT THE END OF THE YEAR WHAT RISE THERE'S NO CAP ON COSTS. YEAH I'M LIKE A KIND OF FOLLOW UP ON THE COMMENT YOU MADE WITH REGARD TO THE ABILITY TO TREAT MEDI CAL MEDICARE PATIENTS EQUALLY AS. SAY PRIVATE BEER COMMERCIAL AND% SELECTORS TO ISSUES AT HAND NUMBER ONE IS THE TREATMENT OF THE PATIENT WHICH I HAVE SOME EVIDENCE HERE OF INDIVIDUALS ARE SAYING THIS. AND THEN THE EXTREME PROFITS THAT YOU'RE NOT STATING THAT THE DIALYSIS INDUSTRY WHICH IS. BEING DOMINATED BY ESSENTIALLY TWO ENTITIES IS MAKING. WHAT EVIDENCE DO YOU SHOW OR DO WE HAVE BECAUSE I HAVE A REAL PROBLEM IF SOMEBODY ON MEDICAID OR MEDICARE IS BEING TREATED DIFFERENTLY THAN SOMEBODY IN COMMERCIAL? WHAT KIND OF ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE DO WE HAVE? BUT SENATOR YEAH I'D LIKE TO SPEAK TO THAT. AS A DIALYSIS NURSE WORKING FOR TO BE TO ENFORCE ANY HAS I'VE SEEN FIRSTHAND. WHERE THE INDUSTRY HAS? PRETTY MUCH. TAKEN THE RELATIONSHIP THAT I HAVE AS A NURSE. BUT MY PATIENTS AND SOCIAL WORKERS HAVE WITH THEIR PATIENTS. AND HAVE IN. BECAUSE THIS TO ENGAGE PATIENTS AND TO TRY TO CONVERT THEM FROM THEIR MEDICARE HOW. AND THEIR MEDICARE AND TO THESE PRIVATE INSURANCE'S. PURELY FOR PROFIT. THEY DISGUISE IT. BOB VERY WELL. PATIENTS ARE REALLY NOT INFORMED ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE DOING AND WHAT THE. THE CONSEQUENCE OF THAT IS. FOR ITS AS IF THEY GET A TRANSPLANT. WHAT HAPPENS IS A PATIENT WILL NO LONGER BE QUALIFIED TO RECEIVE A THIRD PARTY PAYER FROM THE A. K. HALF? AND THEY'LL END UP. HAPPEN TO CARRY THAT TWENTY PERCENT. PREMIUM THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO PAY. AND AS WE KNOW MOST PATIENTS THEIR ON DIALYSIS ON DISABILITY. THEY CAN'T AFFORD THAT THEY CAN AFFORD THAT THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IS GOING TO COST HIM FOR THE ANTI REJECTION MEDICATIONS. THEY CAN AFFORD IT AND SO. THEY HAVE. PUT PRESSURE ON SOCIAL WORKERS AND. NURSES TO SPEAK TO PATIENTS ABOUT CONVERTING OVER TO THESE DIFFERENT PLANTS. AS. PURE PROFIT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE PATIENT RELATIONSHIP THANK YOU CARE LESS ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THE PATIENT. IT'S ALL ABOUT MONEY LET'S BE CLEAR HERE IT IT'S ALL ABOUT MONEY SOCIALIST LET'S FOLLOW UP AND TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT. MANAGE STANDING CREEK WHERE I'M WRONG THAT IF YOU ARE GET TEN IN STAGE RENAL DISEASE AUTOMATICALLY QUALIFY FOR MEDICARE AT THAT POINT. I DON'T THINK YOU CAN TRANSFER OVER. TO A. COMMERCIAL PAY AND IT WAS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT WHAT YOU'RE TELLING ME IS THAT TEN PERCENT. OF THE COMMERCIAL MARKET WHEN YOU'RE COMPARING THE RATES OF A THOUSAND TO FIFTY UNLESS FOR MEDI CAL. SOME ASSUMING THAT THERE'S A LOT OF COST SHIFTING ON THE COMMERCIAL DOT ORG CORRECT. AND IF THAT'S THE CASE THEN IF THERE IS A LOT OF COST SHIFTING BEFORE THEY BECOME AND STAGE RENAL IT SEEMED LIKE THAT WOULD BE TOTALLY INAPPROPRIATE TO TRY TO ENCOURAGE PATIENTS TO GO INTO THE COMMERCIAL MARKET. HERE'S A CONCERN I HAVE. IF WE HAVE COST SHIFTING. AND YOU HAVE AN INDUSTRY THAT'S PROFITING IN EXCESS PROFITS A COST SHIFTING IS GOING OF COMMERCIAL GUESS WHO PAYS FOR IT. WAITED ALL OF US THAT'S RIGHT THAT'S THE REAL REAL CONCERN AND THAT I HAVE. IT'S TO COST SHIFTING TO THE HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY. MAN YOU KNOW SO. A QUESTION I HAVE IS. WITH REGARD TO THE PROBABILITY MAYBE YOU MIGHT BE ABLE ANSWER THIS BECAUSE I HEARD AND MAYBE AFTER GOD WHO WAS IT SAID THAT THERE IS FIVE TIMES HIGHER AND I'VE. HEARD THAT YOU KNOW THAT THEIR PROFIT MARGINS DIALYSIS CLINICS HAVE INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY PAST SEVEN YEARS TEN YEARS TO SEVENTY PERCENT. WHERE YOU GETTING THIS INFORMATION FROM THE AND WE HAVE ANY EVIDENCE AND? DATA THAT CAN SHOW. THE PROFITABILITY MARGINS. SO THE FIRST PLACE WE'RE GETTING THIS DATA IS FROM OUR SPOT. THAT CLINICS AT THE CLINIC LEVEL REPORT THEIR PROFITABILITY EACH YEAR. AND ALSO REPORTED GOVERNING ENTITIES WE CAN ROLL THAT UP EASILY AND SO. OFTEN DATA SHOWS THAT IN TWENTY SIXTEEN THE DIALYSIS INDUSTRY PROFITED ROUGHLY FOUR HUNDRED AND SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS JUST HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND I WANT TO ANNOUNCE. BETWEEN SEVENTEEN AND EIGHTEEN PERCENT PROFIT MARGIN AND THAT'S CONSISTENT WITH THE TOO LARGE FOR PROFIT COMPANIES. PROFIT MARGIN NATIONALLY AS WELL. AND I DO WANT TO WANT TO FOCUS A LITTLE BIT ON THAT FOUR HUNDRED AND SEVENTY MILLION DOLLAR NUMBER. BECAUSE AS THE LA OVARIAN CORRECTLY REPORTED. THIS HAS THE POTENTIAL TO GENERATE A FEW HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. IN REDUCTIONS IN WHERE THE INDUSTRY IS CURRENTLY ABOVE THAT REVENUE CAP. SO EVEN IF THAT FEW HUNDRED MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN WHICH THEY'RE CURRENTLY ABOVE THE CAP. ALL HAD TO BE ISSUED IN REFUNDS THAT STILL LEAVES THE DIALYSIS INDUSTRY WITH HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN PROFIT. AND SO I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT ANY CLAIM THAT THERE WOULD BE. NO PROFIT LEFT IN THIS INDUSTRY OR THAT THERE WOULD NEED TO BE SOME KIND OF REDUCTION IN SERVICES BECAUSE THERE WOULD NOT BE A RETURN ON CAPITAL. IS REALLY CLAIMING THAT HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS STILL ISN'T ENOUGH. AND THAT THAT'S NOT ENOUGH PROFITS WERE NOT TALKING ABOUT. WHAT A CLINIC PEOPLE WOULD OCCUR DIALYSIS COMPANY BE PROFITABLE OR NOT? WE'RE SAYING ARE THEY STILL GOING TO BE ABLE TO MAKE SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN PERCENT PROFIT MARGINS OR THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO COME MORE IN LINE WITH FOR EXAMPLE THE FIVE PERCENT PROFIT MARGIN THAT IS THE AVERAGE FOR HOSPITALS IN CALIFORNIA. WE'RE NOT TRYING. TO ELIMINATE. PROFIT IN THIS INDUSTRY WE'RE TRYING TO BRING IT INTO LINE WITH WHAT THE REST OF THE HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY. VERY SUCCESSFULLY OPERATES WITH IT IN LIMIT LET ME JUST SAY AGAIN FOLLOW POLLUTED MORE AND THE COMMENT YOU MADE AND. WITH REGARD TO THE OVERALL PROFITABILITY OF ANY ENTITY WHETHER IT'S. OVERALL. COMBINED. GROUP OF CLINICS SOME IS GONNA READ A SECTION FROM THE. INITIATIVE FOR THE PURPOSE OF THIS SECTION THE FAIR TREATMENT. PAYMENT AMOUNT SHALL BE THE AMOUNT EQUAL TO ONE HUNDRED FIFTY PERCENT OF THE SOME. OF ALL DIRECT PATIENT CARE SERVICES COSTS AND ALL HEALTH CARE QUALITY IMPROVEMENT COSTS INCURRED. BY GOVERNING ANTI AND IT'S CHRONIC DIALYSIS CLINICS SO EVEN IF YOU WERE TO HIRE MORE NURSES INCREASE THE I. T. THAT GOES THAT'S TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION AND THAT ON TOP OF THAT STILL ALLOWS EVERY ENTITY EVEN IF YOU HAVE. A GOVERNING ENTITY THAT HAS SOME CLINICS THAT ARE NOT AS WELL BUT THE OVERALL TO HAVE AT LEAST A FIFTEEN PERCENT PROFIT MARGIN. WHICH SEEMS TO ME FAIR AND REASONABLE BUT WHEN IT ALSO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT MARKET CONSOLIDATIONS AND SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT I HAVE. IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM IN THE COST SHIFTING IN THE LAND OF THE EXPENSES THERE WERE HAVING WITHIN THE SYSTEM. TO ME I THINK THE BIGGEST AREAS AND THE CONCERNS I HAVE IS EXACTLY THAT OF MARKET CONSOLIDATION. YOU LOOK AT HEALTH PLANS BY OF HEALTH PLANS YOU LOOKING HOSPITAL SYSTEMS BY AN IMPOSSIBLE SIZZLE MEDICAL GROUPS BY A MEDICAL GROUPS. AND WHEN YOU HAVE CONSOLIDATION IT COULD CREATE MONOPOLIZATION. WHEN YOU'RE MONOPOLIZATION UNFORTUNATE THAT COULD CAUSE INCREASE BECAUSE THOSE ARE PASSED ON TO THE CONSUMERS IN THE FORM OF HIGHER PREMIUMS ARE HEALTH CARE. I GET SO. I'VE I BELIEVE THAT THERE IS DEFINITELY A PROBLEM AND I THINK THERE'S ANOTHER IN THE AREA THAT WE NEED TO CONTROL COSTS OBVIOUSLY HIS PRESCRIPTION DRUGS BUT THAT'S ANOTHER CONVERSATION FOR ANOTHER DAY WOULDN'T. ANYWAY THOSE ARE MY QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS THAT I HAVE THANK YOU TO SCARE HER. ANYONE ELSE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MUCH PRESSURE. WILL BRING UP OUR SECOND PANEL. I FIGURED OUT WHENEVER YOU'RE READY AS BEFORE FIVE TO SEVEN MINUTES PER. PER PERSON THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS DANIEL IN THE US ARE FROM SOME OF ROLE TOWN OUTSIDE OF FRESNO. ALSO BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF DIALYSIS PATIENTS CITIZENS. I'VE BEEN A MEMBER OF THE PC FOR OVER TEN YEARS. DALLAS PAGE SAID IS THAT IF THE PATIENT LED NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION DEDICATED TO IMPROVING DALLAS'S CITIZENS AUDIO LIFE BY ADVOCATING FOR FAVORABLE PUBLIC. POLICY WE HAVE MORE THAN TWENTY EIGHT THOUSAND PAGE MEMBERS INCLUDING SIXTY FIVE HUNDRED PATIENTS IN CALIFORNIA. WE ARE GRAVELY CONCERNED ABOUT HIS BALLOT MEASURE WHAT SIGNIFICANTLY LIMIT ACCESS TO DALLAS'S CARE FOR PATIENTS AND JEOPARDIZE THEIR HEALTH AND THEIR LIVES. WHEN I WAS TWELVE I GOT DIAGNOSED WITH THAT KIDNEY DISEASE AS A RESULT OF THE BICYCLE ACCIDENT. I'M THIRTY SEVEN SOME BLESSED I ALSO I ALSO WAS ON DOUBTS AS RETAIN YEARS PHONE VERY FAMILIAR WITH THE CARE PROVIDED TO ME. I WAS YOU WE CAN TRANSPLANT SAW NO LONGER ANALYSIS BUT I BECOME A PATIENT ADVOCATE BECAUSE I KNOW FIRST HAND HOW GRUELING THE PROCESS THAT THEY ALSO USES. I SPENT A LOT OF TIME IN TAOS CLINGS HOPPING OTHER PATIENTS. DEATH IS PATIENTS RECEIVE GAS IS THREE TO FOUR TIMES. A WEEK FOR FOUR HOURS AT A TIME. WE ARE DEL THIS TAX AND NURSES AND STAFF. ADEPTUS CLINK AS MUCH AS WE SEE OUR FAMILIES. I CAN TELL YOU FIRST HAND THAT THE STATEMENTS MADE BY THE. PROPONENTS OF THIS INITIATIVE DO NOT REPRESENT THE CARE THAT I RECEIVE NOR DO THEY MATCH WHAT I'VE HEARD FROM PATIENTS CURRENTLY TREATING TODAY. I RECEIVED NOTHING BUT TOP NOTCH CARE IN CLEAN AND HEALTHY ENVIRONMENT. ADVOCATES SENSES OF THAT MANY DEATHS PAGES I TALK TO ALL THE TIME. IF. IF WE WERE TO BE HONEST OURSELVES WE HAVE NO QUESTION ABOUT THE BORDERS OF THE PROPONENTS. S. C. I. E. W. YOU HW IS TRYING TO ORGANIZE DAUSA THE WORKERS I PERSONALLY DON'T CARE. ONE WAY OR ANOTHER ABOUT IT. BUT WHEN I DO CARE ABOUT THE LITTLE MAKES ME VERY UPSET. IS THAT IT APPEARS THAT YOU WHICH W. IS USING PATIENT THAT'S PONDS TO PUT PRESSURE ON DIALYSIS. COMPANIES TO UNIONIZE THAT'S NOT RIGHT. THEY DRAFTED INITIATIVE THAT IS ONLY GOING TO HARM PATIENTS. TAKING MONEY OUT OF THE HOUSE IS CARE WILL IMPROVE PATIENT CARE IT WILL MAKE MORE PATIENTS WORSE OFF BECAUSE THEY CAN LOSE ACCESS TO CARE. THIS MEASURE LIMITS THE PRIVATE INSURANCE COMPANIES TO PAY THE HOUSES COLLEAGUES TO PROVIDE CARE. THESE THEM IS DO NOT PROVIDE ENOUGH TO COVER THE OPERATING COSTS OF A CLINIC. AND INITIALLY IT WILL FORCE MANY CLAIMS CLINICS TO SHUT DOWN OR REDUCE HOURS. AND NOTHING IN THIS MEASURE REQUIRES INSURANCE COMPANIES TO PASS EVEN ONE CENT. OF THE LOWER COST ONTO PATIENTS. THIS MEASURE MAY BE GOOD FOR A FEW INSURANCE COMPANIES BUT IT WILL BE TERRIBLE FOR SIXTY SIX THOUSAND PATIENTS WHO RELY ON DIALYSIS TO SURVIVE. AND THE PATIENT WILL BE HURT WHAT WORST ARE THE PATIENT LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES AS RURAL COMMUNITIES WE ACCESS TO CLINICS ALREADY. THAT ALREADY STRAINED. KENNY FAILURE IS PARTICULARLY ACUTE AMONG MINORITIES LATINOS AND AFRICAN AMERICANS WHO HAVE HIGHER. INCIDENT OF KIDNEY FAILURE THAN OTHER POPULATIONS. THIS INITIATIVE WILL HARM SO THE MORE VERBAL PATIENTS IN CALIFORNIA. TAKE MY SITUATION FOR EXAMPLE I LIVE IN SELMA. A IF THAT MY CLINIC. LONGTIME CLOSES THE NEAREST CLINIC IS ABOUT TWENTY FIVE MILES AWAY. I MIGHT BE ABLE TO GO THERE FOR TREATMENT BUT WHAT IF IT THAT ONE CLOSES. THEN WHAT GORDO NEXT. CLOSES WHEN WHAT IF ONE CAN TAKE ME BECAUSE IT'S ALREADY FULL. IF A PATIENT WHO HAVE TO TRAVEL FURTHER TO DOWNSIZE BECAUSE THE CLINIC IS CLOSED IT WILL PUT FURTHER STRAIN ON THE PATIENT AND THEIR FAMILIES. EVEN WORSE IF CLINICS. IF PLANTS CLOSE MANY PAVE WHO WILL END UP AN EMERGENCY ROOM. DUE TO COMPLICATIONS FOR MISSING ANALYSIS AND PENSIONS WILL BEGIN TO. GET INTO HOUSES IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM INSTEAD OF CLEANING CLINICS. IT'S INFURIATING THAT PROPONENTS WHAT PUT PATIENTS LIVES AT RISK TO FURTHER THEIR POLITICALAND UNION ORGANIZING AGENDA. THIS INITIATIVE PUTS PATIENTS WE REPRESENT IN GREAT DANGER AND THAT'S SIMPLY UNACCEPTABLE. AGAIN I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH THE YOU KNOW WANT TO TRY TO ORGANIZE WORKERS BUT I HAVE A MAJOR PROBLEM WHETHER YOU VULNERABLE PATIENTS AS PAWNS. THIS BALLOT INITIATIVE IS DEEPLY FLAWED AND DANGEROUS THAT'S WHY IS OPPOSED BY THE PATIENT ADVOCACY GROUPS. LIKE OURS THEY'RE GONNA SUPPORT NETWORK THE CHRONIC DISEASE COALITION AND DOZENS OF OTHER GROUPS REPRESENT DOCTORS PATIENTS AND NURSES AND OTHERS. I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY AND GIVE YOUR VOICE TO THE PATIENTS WHO WILL BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED. IF THIS MEASURE PASSES THANK YOU SO MUCH. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS DOCTOR AMY CHEN I'M A PHYSICIAN IN FRESNO. I SPECIALIZE IN THE PRODIGY I TAKE CARE OF PATIENTS WITH KIDNEY DISEASE I REALLY APPRECIATE YOU GUYS TAKEN THE TIME TO LISTEN TO US TODAY. I BEGAN PRIVATE PRACTICE IN TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR IN FRESNO AND MY PARTNER AND I TOGETHER TAKE CARE OF. OVER TWO HUNDRED PATIENTS WHO HAVE AND STAGE RENAL DISEASE AND THEY NEED DIALYSIS TO SURVIVE. MY PRIORITY AS A KIDNEY DOCTOR IS SOLELY THE WELL BEING OF MY PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES. I AM STRONGLY OPPOSED TO THIS BALLOT PROPOSITION THAT WE ARE DISCUSSING TODAY. THOUGH I DID HEAR THE LAST. PANEL MY CONCERN IS THAT CLINICS WOULD CLOSE THAT SHIPS WILL CLOSE. AND THAT WOULD BE DISASTROUS FOR MY PATIENTS AND FOR THE SIXTY SIX THOUSAND PATIENTS IN CALIFORNIA ON DIALYSIS. I CAME TO SACRAMENTO TODAY TO TESTIFY BECAUSE I HAVE YEARS OF DIRECT AND PERSONAL EXPERIENCE WITH ACCESS. WITH DIALYSIS PATIENTS OBTAINING ACCESS TO DIALYSIS. WHEN I STARTED IN FRESNO THEIR WERE LESS THAN A HANDFUL OF CLINICS OPEN TO SERVE THE ENTIRE AREA. AND WHAT WAS GOING ON AT THAT TIME IS THAT NEW DIALYSIS PATIENTS WOULD DIAL EYES IN THE HOSPITAL WHILE THEY WERE WAITING FOR A CONFIRMED OUTPATIENT SPOT. OFTEN THIS WOULD TAKE MONTHS SO THESE PATIENTS WERE DIAL ISING IN THE HOSPITAL FOR MONTHS AT A TIME. AND IT CAN TAKE A LONG TIME TO BUILD A NEW FACILITY. AND EVEN LONGER FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH TO APPROVE ITS USE. DURING THE TIME THESE PATIENTS WERE DIAL ISING IN THE HOSPITAL. THEY'D THEY OF COURSE NEED A CONFIRMED SPOT BEFORE THEY CAN LEAVE. AND I HOPE THE REASONS FOR THAT ARE CLEAR TO YOU. MISSING DIALYSIS IS INCREDIBLY DANGEROUS FOR THESE PEOPLE. ONE MISS TREATMENT INCREASES THE RISK OF DEATH BY THIRTY PERCENT SO WE COULD NOT TAKE THAT RISK THEY HAD TO STAY IN THE HOSPITAL UNTIL THEY FOUND A SPOT. THESE PATIENTS HAD NO OTHER ACUTE ISSUES THEY WERE JUST IN THE HOSPITAL TO RECEIVE DIALYSIS. THEY HAD TO TAKE TIME OFF FROM WORK HAD TO BE AWAY FROM THEIR FAMILIES THEIR OTHER RESPONSIBILITIES. IT WAS A VERY DIFFICULT TIME FOR THESE PATIENTS AND THIS LASTED FOR SEVERAL YEARS. IT WAS A FRUSTRATING TIME TO BE A PHYSICIAN AND A FRUSTRATING TIME TO BE A PART OF THE TEAM. THAT TRIED TO HELP THESE PATIENTS. SINCE THEN WE'VE MADE STRIDES IN OBTAINING ACCESS TO PATIENTS. BUT I THINK YOU CAN SEE HOW LIMITING ACCESSCOULD REALLY HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON PATIENTS WHO NEED THE TREATMENT. EACH CLINIC TREATS APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED TWO HUNDRED TWENTY PATIENTS THOUGH SOME TO FIFTY UP TO THREE HUNDRED PATIENTS. WHAT IT WOULD HAPPEN IF JUST ONE OF THOSE CLINICS IN MY AREA CLOSES IT'S ACTUALLY QUITE HARD TO IMAGINE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY PATIENTS? WITHOUT A PLACE TO GO. NOW WHAT IF TO CLOSE. FOR MORE. WHERE WOULD THESE PATIENTS GO? OF COURSE THE ONLY LOGICAL OPTION AT THAT POINT WOULD BE THE HOSPITAL. FLORA SOMEBODY WHO HAS TRAVELLED AROUND THE AREA FRESNO TO THE RULE OUTLYING AREAS. WHERE THESE NEW CLINICS HAVE POPPED UP TO SERVE THE NEEDS OF THOSE PATIENTS OUT IN THOSE AREAS I CAN TELL YOU THAT THOSE CLINICS THOSE COUNTRY CLINICS? ARE LIFESAVING FOR THOSE PATIENTS. THEY IMAGINE IF THEY HAD TO DRIVE AN EXTRA THIRTY FORTY FIVE MILES AND THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS HAD TO DRIVE THEM THEY WOULD MISS TREATMENTS. INCREASE RISK OF DEATH. SO THOSE RULE OUTLYING CLINICS ARE VERY IMPORTANT AND I FEAR THOSE TO BE THE ONES MOST AFFECTED BY THIS BY EITHER CLOSING OR LOWERING SHIFTS. OR WHAT NOT WHICH WOULD BE DISASTROUS. I BELIEVE IT COULD CREATE A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS IN CALIFORNIA. OTHER UNITS I CAN TELL YOU CAN NOT ABSORB PATIENTS THAT DO NOT HAVE A PLACE TO DIE LIES. AND AS YOU KNOW THE EMERGENCY ROOMS ARE ALREADY PASSED THEIR CAPACITY. IT'S CLEAR WHILE THE PHYSICIANS ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE TAKEN A POSITION ON THIS MEASURE HAVE A POST. THE RENO POSITIONS ASSOCIATION OPPOSES AMERICAN COLLEGE OF EMERGENCY PHYSICIANS OPPOSES COUNTY MEDICAL SOCIETIES WE ALL OPPOSE. I DON'T THINK OF MY PATIENTS AS POLITICAL PAWNS. AND I THINK THAT THAT'S PRETTY IRRESPONSIBLE TO DO SO. THEY THESE ARE PEOPLE THEY HAVE VERY DIFFICULT LIVES THEY HAVE A DIFFICULT TIME EVERYDAY. AND I THINK THIS PROPOSAL WOULD BE VERY DANGEROUS TO THEM. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON I'M CHRISTY FOR AND I'M HERE REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA DIALYSIS COUNCIL. AND WE REPRESENT BOTH NONPROFIT AND FOR PROFIT PROVIDERS A DIALYSIS SERVICES IN CALIFORNIA. OUR MEMBERS PROBABLY PROVIDE HIGH QUALITY COMPASSIONATE CARE TO SIXTY SIX THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS WHO DEPEND ON DIALYSIS TO STAY ALIVE. EVERY COMPANY THAT PROVIDES DIALYSIS IN CALIFORNIA ALONG WITH THE DIALYSIS COUNCIL ARE STRONGLY OPPOSE THIS BALLOT MEASURE. IT WOULD BE ABSOLUTELY DEVASTATING. AND SHADOW THE DIALYSIS PROVIDER NETWORK. SIMPLY PUT THIS INITIATIVE WOULD MAKE THE BUSINESS OF OPERATING OUTPATIENT DIALYSIS CLINICS IN CALIFORNIA ECONOMICALLY UNVIABLE. AND THAT WOULD BE VERY DISASTROUS FOR THE SIXTY SIX THOUSAND PATIENTS IN CALIFORNIA WHO DEPEND ON DIALYSIS TO STAY ALIVE. IT IS CLEAR THAT THIS INITIATIVE WAS WRITTEN BY PEOPLE WHO ARE UNFAMILIAR WITH OUR INDUSTRY. THE INITIATIVE RATCHETS DOWN WHAT DIALYSIS COMPANIES CAN CHARGE PRIVATE INSURANCE COMPANIES TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN PERCENT OF WHAT THE PROPONENTS HAVE DEFINED. AS PATIENT CARE SERVICES COSTS. HOWEVER. THESE ALLOWABLE CHARGES FAILED TO ACCOUNT FOR MANY OF THE IMPORTANT EXPENSES NECESSARY TO PROVIDE HIGH QUALITY PATIENT CARE. FOR INSTANCE THE INITIATIVE SPECIFICALLY PREVENTS CLINICS FROM BILLING INSURANCE COMPANIES FOR MANAGERIAL STAFF AND OTHER CRITICAL EXPENSES NECESSARY TO OPERATE A CLINIC. THE INITIATIVE ALSO EXCLUDES THE POSITION MEDICAL DIRECTOR. A POSITION REQUIRED BY THE CENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICES. THE MEDICAL DIRECTOR IS RESPONSIBLE FOR OVERSEEING CLINICAL QUALITY AND PATIENT CARE. IT EXCLUDES NURSE MANAGERS AND EMPLOYEES WHO HELP PATIENTS NAVIGATE THE FINANCIAL AND COMMUNITY SERVICES. AS WELL AS OTHER TEAM MEMBERS CRITICAL TO PROVIDING HIGH QUALITY CARE. IT MAKES NO SENSE. OUR INDUSTRY HIRED FORMER LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S BILL HAM AND HIS TEAM OF ECONOMIC CONSULTANTS AT THE BERKELEY RESEARCH GROUP. TO CONDUCT AN INDEPENDENT ANALYSIS OF THIS BALLOT MEASURE. WHAT THEY FOUND WAS THAT THE MEASURE WOULD LITERALLY SHATTER THE ENTIRE INDUSTRY? BOTH FOR PROFIT AND NONPROFIT PROVIDERS. FOR STARTERS THIS INITIATIVE SO CALLED PATIENT SERVICES COSTS ONLY ACCOUNT FOR ON AVERAGE SIXTY NINE PERCENT OF THE COST OF OPERATING A CLINIC IN CALIFORNIA. MOST STARTLING ACCORDING TO THEIR INDEPENDENT ANALYSIS IF THIS INITIATIVE WERE TO PASS. EIGHTY THREE PERCENT OF CLINICS WOULD HAVE NEGATIVE OPERATING MARGINS. AND THE NEGATIVE IMPACTS ARE SPREAD ACROSS ALL PROVIDER TYPES. FOR PROFITS NONPROFITS AND RULE CLINICS URBAN CLINICS CLINICS WITH HIGH PERCENT OF MEDICAL AND MEDICARE. THIS INITIATIVE IS INDISCRIMINATE. IT WOULD EQUALLY CRUSH ALL MANNER IN TYPES OF DIALYSIS CLINICS. LET'S BE CLEAR. IT'S MY IF MOST OR EVEN SOME OF THE CLINICS WERE FORCED TO CLOSE OR CUT BACK OPERATIONS BECAUSE THE INITIATIVE. IT WOULD BE DEVASTATING FOR PATIENTS. THEY NEED FOR DIALYSIS IS GROWING AT ABOUT FIVE PERCENT A YEAR IN CALIFORNIA. AND WE'VE HAD A HARD TIME AS IT IS KEEPING UP WITH THE DEMAND TODAY. THE CLOSURE OF CLINICS WOULD BE A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS. PATIENTS WOULD BE FORCED TO TREAT IN THE HOSPITAL OR BE PUSHED INTO EMERGENCY ROOMS DUE TO COMPLICATIONS FROM MISSING TREATMENTS. OUR INDUSTRY WILL WORK HARD TO EDUCATE THE VOTERS AND DEFEAT THIS MEASURE. BECAUSE IF IT PASSES IT WOULD BE DEVASTATING FOR THE PATIENTS. THANK YOU. A MUCH. QUESTIONS. COMING. HERNANDEZ. SO. I DON'T DISAGREE THAT. I THINK THE ABSOLUTE HIGHEST PRIORITY OF OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM IS TO MAKE SURE NUMBER ONE WE HAVE ACCESS. ACCESS TO THE MOST VULNERABLE ACCESS AND RURAL INNER CITY. AND I THAT'S SERVICE SEEMS TO BE ENDEMIC OF THE PROBLEMS WE HAVE IN OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM PERIOD I MEAN. WE JUST HAVE DOCTORS THAT DON'T TAKE MEDI CAL ON THERE. IT CENTRO. SO THAT I MEAN OBVIOUSLY IF I REALLY FELT THAT THIS INITIATIVE WOULD GO IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION AYE WHEN SUPPORTIVE BUT I I DON'T SEE THAT AND THEN. THE OTHER THING TOO IS I KEEP HEARING REPEATING PATIENTS AGAINST. YOU KNOW. THE INDUSTRY A END THAT. AN ENTITY IS TRYING TO ORGANIZE. SO HERE'S AND I DON'T KNOW HIM AND HAVE A QUESTION YET BUT HERE HERE'S SOME NOT. I DECIDE I'M JUST EVER COLLIDED STATEMENTS I THINK YOU NEED TO MAKE RIGHT NOW. AND BESIDES GONNA VOTE IN ON THIS BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO BE THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE THAT ALREADY GOING TO VOTE AND THEN THAT ENOUGH SIGNATURES HAVE BEEN GATHERING AND THIS IS WHAT WE'RE DOING OUR DUE DILIGENCE TO MAKE SURE THERE'S. KIND OF ALL THE INFORMATION IS OUT THERE. BOB BUT HERE HERE'S THE CONCERN THAT I HAVE. THE CONCERN THAT I HAVE IS WE HAVE AN EXTREMELY ROBUST HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. AND WE HAVE A HEALTHCARE SYSTEM THAT IS NOW BECOMING. CONSOLIDATED. AND I'VE SEEN VERY VERY SMART SO IN NUMEROUS MARKETS THAT WE'VE GETTING MONOPOLIZATION. WE HAVE WOMEN OPPOSITIONS AND HOSPITAL SYSTEMS HERE IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WHERE HOSPITAL SYSTEMS ARE CAUSING A LOT MORE THAN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. AND WHEN YOU HAVE TO ENTITIES ARE PRETTY MUCH DOMINATE THE MARKET I CAN VERY EASILY SEE THAT YOU CAN HAVE A MOP MONOPOLIZATION. SO. THE PROBLEM THAT I SEE IS THAT WHEN YOU HAVE THAT AND YOU ARE GOING TO BE HAVING HIGH COST. THERE ARE GOING TO BE PASSED ON TO THE CONSUMER MARKET. WELL GUESS WHAT. GUESS WHO THAT'S GOING TO AFFECT THE STATEMENT I MADE EARLY IT'S GOING TO AFFECT THE OVERALL HEALTH CARE MARKET IN THE PREMIUMS THAT WE ALL PAY FOR. IF YOU THINK ABOUT. THE SUCCESS THAT WE'VE HAD IN THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND WHEN I SPEAK TO COVER CALIFORNIA THE NUMBER ONE CONCERN BY CONSUMERS. IN THIS STATE IN THIS COUNTRY. IT'S NOT THEIR NARROW NETWORKS IT'S NOT. WHAT DO YOU THINK IT IS IT'S THE COST OF THEIR HEALTH CARE? OKAY. KNOW WHEN YOU LOOK AT EIGHTY PERCENT OF YOUR PATIENTS ARE THE PATIENT DIALYSIS CLINICS ARE MEDICARE WELL GUESS WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS GOING TO SET THE PRICES. AND I'VE WHENEVER I SPEAK TO LARGE GROUPS OR ENTITIES I THINK YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO BE A FIGURE OUT HOW DO WE CONTROL COSTS BECAUSE OF WE DON'T CONTROL COST GUESS WHAT THE CONSUMER IS GOING TO CONTROL THEM FOR YOU. IN THE FORMER WHAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW THE INITIATIVE. SYSTEM SO. YOU KNOW I. I REALLY BELIEVE THAT THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT WE NEED TO LEASE HAVE A SERIOUS CONVERSATION JUST IN THIS COMMITTEE THERE WAS A BILL THAT CAME THROUGH. THAT'S DEALING WITH THE ENTIRE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. AND I BELIEVE THAT IT'S THE PUBLIC THAT'S THE POINT OF. WHERE WE NEED TO START HAVING SOME SERIOUS CONVERSATIONS? AND AGAIN LET ME JUST I THINK WHAT WAS. MISS FOR A I THINK YOU MADE A STATEMENT EARLIER ABOUT EXCLUDING MEDICAL DIRECTORS OF ON A MISTAKE I THINK SENATE I MEAN DOCTOR WOULD SUMMER WOULD CHAIRMAN ASKED A QUESTION EARLIER AND I THINK IT WAS ANSWERED AND UP. IT WHAT MY UNDERSTANDING IS IT WAS EXCLUDED. ALL RIGHTS INCLUDED WITHIN THE HOUR. GOVERNING ENTITY SO IT IS THAT INCORRECT OR NOT. WELL IT'S OUR INTERPRETATION WHEN WE LOOK AT THE LANGUAGE. IT SAID THAT IT SHALL INCLUDE ONLY NON MANAGERIAL. STAFF AND THE MEDICAL DIRECTOR IS A MANAGERIAL STAFF ALONG WITH THE NURSE MANAGER CLINIC ADMINISTRATOR. OKAY WE DON'T REALLY KNOW THAT WE WILL NOT COME UP AND CLARIFY THAT BECAUSE I THINK WE'VE GOT A. RESPONSE FROM THE PROPONENTS OF HOW DURING THE AMENDMENT PROCESS THAT THEY TRY TO ADDRESS THIS. SO. YES THANK YOU AGAIN. JOHN ALLEN FOR THE CA YOU YOU HW. AND YES IT IS IT IS OUR. INTERPRETATION OF THE INITIATIVE THAT WE'VE WRITTEN THAT MEDICAL DIRECTORS WOULD. BE INCLUDED AS AS PATIENT CARE. IN I WOULD JUST SAY I THINK AS THAT ELIOT STATED EARLIER THAT STILL SOMETHING THAT'S OPEN TO DISCUSSION SO I I I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THERE'S. A DEFINITIVE ANSWER TO THAT. I THINK THE LA OVER. POINTED OUT IN THEIR PRESENTATION EARLIER. THAT IT REALLY DOES DEPEND ON WHO IS INCLUDED AND ARE READING OF THE LANGUAGE THAT IS CURRENTLY. GONNA BE PROPOSED FOR THE BALLOT. IS THAT IT'S NON MANAGERIAL STAFF. ARE THE ONLY ONES THAT ARE INCLUDED SO MAYBE YOU CAN WORK WITH THE PROPONENTS A FIX THAT IN THE INITIATIVE PROCESS. I THINK IS A LITTLE TOO LATE FOR THAT I A GLOBAL LANGUAGE IS ALREADY IN THE PAST. VIA. LET ME WHICH MAKE THIS INITIATIVE BETTER SO THAT WE CAN INCLUDE. BUT I I THINK THE PROBLEM NOW IS THE WAY IT'S WRITTEN IN IT AND UNFORTUNATELY THE LANGUAGE AS AND THE INITIATIVE NOW. DOES EXCLUDE THOSE EXTRA COSTS AND I THINK THAT'S PART OF THE PROBLEM AS TO WHY IN OUR ANALYSIS. IT'S GONNA HAVE SUCH A DEVASTATING IMPACT ON THE CLINICS IS BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY OTHER STAFF MEMBERS THAT ARE REQUIRED BY CMS THAT ARE NOT INCLUDED. IN THIS COST ANALYSIS SO LET'S SAY ASSUMING WE WORD THAT WEREN'T THE CASE AND THERE WAS A MINOR AMOUNT TO SEE MANAGEMENT STAFF. AND LET'S SAY WERE ADDRESS DO YOU REALLY BELIEVE DO YOU BELIEVE THAT A FIFTEEN PERCENT PROFIT BILLY MARGINS FOR ALL ENTITIES IS FAIR. I THINK THE DIFFICULTY AGAIN IS ON HOW YOU DEFINE IT AND I THINK THAT'S A PROBLEM THERE ARE SO MANY OTHER STAFF MEMBERS AND IT DEPENDS ON EACH CLINIC. AND I THINK THAT'S PART OF THE PROBLEM. AGAIN AS A LA O. EXPLAINED I MEAN THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE GOVERNMENT ENTITIES. YES SO THE OVERALL GOVERNING AND THE ABILITY OF A. LET'S SAY A PARTICULAR GROUP WHETHER IT'S FISTS FOR SENDING OUT OR. DE VITA. THE THE OVERALL PROFITABILITY THAT WOULD HE BE ABLE TO ALLOW THAT ENTITY SO I GUESS THE QUESTION I HAVE FOR YOU OF THOSE QUESTIONS WERE. WORSE A FEISTY WITH THE MANAGERIAL STAFF EXCLUDING MEDICAL DIRECTOR INCLUDING MEDICAL DIRECTORS EMPLOYEES ETCETERA. DO YOU BELIEVE A FIFTEEN PERCENT MARGIN OF PROFITABILITY IS FAIR. I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THE FAIR AMOUNT WOULD BE AMENDED AGAIN IT WOULD DEPEND ON WHAT IS INCLUDED IN THE EYES OF A LEVERAGES FOR THREE TO FOUR TO FIVE PERCENT. YEAH I WOULD HAVE KNOW IDEA WHAT NUMBER DID PAIN AGAIN ON THE DEFINITION OF WHO YOU INCLUDED AND EACH SPECIFIC CLINIC I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT WHAT NUMBER WOULD BE. SETTLED ON TO BE FAIR. FAIR ENOUGH THOSE STATEMENTS AND THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN PERSON. I MISS A YEAR CAREER. WELL MY MY MAIN COMMENT IS LIKE I KEEP GOING BACK TO MY RURAL COMMUNITIES I HAVE A VERY WORLD COULD. DISTRICT. AND I I. I'M FEARFUL AND FEARFUL OF SOMETHING CLOSES WHERE THEY GO. I'VE HAD FAMILY MEMBERS ARE ON DIALYSIS. IN FACT FIRST DIALYSIS STEPS PLEASED TO HAVE IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES WHEN SHE IS ONE OF THE VERY FIRST. AND I JUST REMEMBER AND I'VE SEEN PEOPLE DIED. CENTERS THEIR VERY FRAIL. AND THE FARTHER THE DISTANCE THEY ARE THAT THEY HAVE TO DRIVE AFTER TREATMENT MAKES ME CRINGE. BECAUSE IT'S NOT A SMOOTH RIDE HOME WHEN YOU'RE NOT FEELING WELL. ND TO MAKE THAT ANY FARTHER THAN SOME OF THESE ARE. DOUBTS WERE I COME FROM ON THIS IS BECAUSE SPENT ACCESS. AND. IT'S. FRIGHTENING TO ME SO. I'M HOPING WE CAN WORK SOMETHING OUT BECAUSE IT JUST SEEMS LIKE. OF THEIR ROLE GOING WANTING TO GO THE SAME DIRECTION THAT WE'VE GOT A FEW THINGS WE NEED TO CLEAN UP BUT. HIS INITIAL PROCESS I DON'T KNOW UP TO SET THE TABLE. POUNDED OUT BUT MUCH RATHER SEE THAT. SENATOR. THANK YOU MISTER SO A QUESTION FOR MS FOISTED. JUST TO TOUCH ON SOMETHING THAT SEND HERNANDEZ. MENTIONED REGARDING CONSOLIDATION AND AND AND IF YOU WOULD. I'M IT'S NOT OFTEN YOU SEE OTHERWISE VERY PROBABLE INDUSTRIES THAT ARE THAT CONSOLIDATED MUST THERE ARE SERIOUS BARRIERS TO ENTRY SO COULD YOU. AND REALLY SIMPLISTIC TERMS CAN YOU EXPLAIN. Y. THE DIALYSIS INDUSTRY IS HAS CONSOLIDATED TO THE POINT WHERE THERE'S REALLY ONLY TWO MAJOR PLAYERS IN CALIFORNIA. I CAN TELL YOU ONE OF THE MAJOR PROBLEMS WITH ENTRY INTO THE MARKET IS BUILDING A NEW UNIT. IN THE PAST IF YOU WANT TO COME INTO CALIFORNIA AND BUILD A NEW DIALYSIS CLINIC YOU NEED TO ACTUALLY. FIND A PIECE OF PROPERTY. BUILDING AT LEAST SET WHATEVER PAY FOR THAT HIGHER ALL YOUR STAFF IT ALL OF THE EQUIPMENT IN PLACE AND THEN YOU HAVE TO WAIT FOR BOTH LICENSE SCENE BY THE DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH. AND THEN ALSO FOR CERTIFICATION THROUGH CMS AND UNFORTUNATELY. THAT SEEM INTO THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH ALSO HAS OVERSIGHT OVER NURSING HOMES AND THEY'RE AT A HIGHER TIER. AND SO THEY GET SURVEYED AND THEY. HOW THE STAFF GO OUT THERE FIRST SO WE'RE KIND OF AT THE BOTTOM OF THE WAITING LIST? AND SO THE PROBLEM HAS BEEN THAT THAT FACILITY HAS TO SIT THERE FULLY OPERATIONAL WAITING. AND SO YOU HAVE TO HAVE A LOT OF CAPITAL IN ORDER TO HAVE THAT IN PLACE BECAUSE IT TAKES ON AVERAGE MONTHS TO JUST GET YOUR INITIAL LICENSING. AND THEN AFTER YOU HAVE YOUR LIST INITIAL LICENSING ONLY AT THAT POINT CAN YOU THEN REQUEST YOUR CMS CERTIFICATION. AND FOR YEARS AND YEARS NOW IT'S BEEN A MINIMUM OF TWELVE MONTHS THAT YOU HAVE TO SIT AND WAIT FOR YOUR CMS CERTIFICATION. AND SO YOU CANNOT START SEEING THOSE PATIENTS UNTIL YOU GET THAT CERTIFICATION SO YOU LITERALLY HAVE TO HAVE ENOUGH CAPITAL HEARING CALIFORNIA TO HAVE THAT FACILITY ALL OF YOUR STAFF IS BEING PAID ALL OF YOUR EQUIPMENT IN PLACE. FOR UPWARDS OF TWELVE MONTHS BEFORE YOU CAN ACTUALLY OPEN. YEAH WE WOULD THAT ALSO BE TRUE OF IF YOU KNOW OTHER KIND OF CAP ATTENTIVE. MEDICAL THOSE SECTORS LIKE SURGICAL CARE CENTERS IS IT THAT DIFFERENT WHAT WHY WHEN OUR SPITTLE IS ALSO INVEST. IN OUT. AND YOU KNOW I'M JUST A DOCTOR I DON'T KNOW A LOT OF THIS ARE NOT JUST A DOCTOR ALL THIS GOBBLEDYGOOK BUT AND I CAN TELL YOU AGAIN FROM EXPERIENCE AND. WHEN I WHEN I FIRST MOVED TO FRESNO THERE WERE MULTIPLE DIFFERENT COMPANIES AND THEY WERE SMALL INDEPENDENT COMPANIES THAT MANAGED THESE DIALYSIS UNITS. AND. THEY WERE VERY POORLY RUN BECAUSE THERE WERE NOT PROTOCOLS THEY CAME CENTRALIZED ON HOW TO TAKE CARE OF PATIENTS. AND WHEN WE IT WAS BROUGHT UP THAT SOME OF THESE PATIENTS. OPERATE IN THE RED YOU NEED TO HAVE A LARGE AMOUNT OF OTHER CLINICS IT AS SOME OF THE I'M SORRY CLINICS OPERATED THE RED YOU NEED TO HAVE A LOT OF THEM. TO OFFSET SOME OF THE MORE RURAL AREAS WHERE ALL THE PATIENTS ARE MEDICARE OR MEDICARE OR WHATEVER AND YOU JUST YOU DON'T MAKE MONEY. THAT THESE THESE PLACES ARE NOT MAKING MONEY. AND SO THEY HAD YOU KNOW ONE OR TWO UNITS IN FRESNO THEY WERE A POORLY RUN AND AGAIN BECAUSE IT DIDN'T HAVE AN ORGANIZED. SNOW TEAM OF DOCTORS AT THE HEAD OF THE CORPORATION THAT SENT DOWN SOME OF THE. THEM DETAILS ON HOW TO MANAGE SOME OF THE. THAT THE PATIENTS AND NUMBER TWO. THE PURCHASING POWER THE OPERATING CLINICS THAT WERE IN POOR AREAS AND THE NEEDING OTHER CLINICS TO OFFSET THAT. SO THAT'S JUST SOME OF THE EXPERIENCE THAT I SAW INITIALLY WHEN I WHEN I CAME HERE AND THEY WERE. BASICALLY CONVERTED THOSE THOSE DIALYSIS UNITS WERE CONVERTED TO LARGER COMPANIES. CHUCK PREACHER THAT'S A DOCTOR DOCTOR CHEN. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT MOST A PHRENOLOGIST IN CALIFORNIA. ARE ALSO CONCERT IN MOSTLY WORKING EITHER FOR WITH THE TWO MAJOR COMPANIES IS THAT CORRECT I KNOW SO I AM A MEDICAL DIRECTOR BECAUSE. CMS REQUIRES THAT ALL OF THE DIALYSIS UNITS HAVE A MEDICAL DIRECTOR. SO IN FRESNO IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE WORTH YOUR SALT AND YOU BASICALLY OUR MEDICAL DIRECTOR IS BECAUSE EVERY UNIT NEEDS ONE. I AM NOT IT I DON'T OWN ANY PART OF THE DIALYSIS FACILITIES I DON'T KNOW WHETHER MOST NEPHROLOGIST HAVE PART SHARE. I CAN TELL YOU THAT THAT THE NEPHROLOGIST THAT I WORK WITH. MY PARTNER AND WE ALSO HAVE SOME SOLO PEOPLE THAT WE. SHARE CALL WITH WE DO NOT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE BUSINESS OF THE UNITS SHOULD IN YOUR CASE HAS CENTER MISS FOR IT WOULD GENERALLY SPEAKING ACROSS THE INDUSTRY. WHAT EXTEND TO WHAT EXTENT DO DOCTORS HAVE A DEBATE AN EQUITY INTEREST IN DIALYSIS CLINICS I WOULDN'T KNOW ANY PERCENTAGE? OF THAT OF ANY EIGHT BIGGER SMALL KIND OF VARIES. THE BIG DISMAL. ACTUALLY I WOULDN'T EVEN KNOW I WOULD I I MEAN AGAIN I WHICH I WOULD SAY SMALL VIA MY WITH A SMALL. NURSE BE DIFFERENT THAN MY UNDERSTANDING BUT THANK YOU CLAIMS CHECK. THE GODS HAVE COUPLE COUPLE QUESTIONS. AND THIS ON ON BALANCE. YOU KNOW WHAT IN WHAT PERCENT OF THE HEALTHCARE DOLLAR IS ACTUALLY. FOR PROFIT. AND HOW MUCH IS REINVESTED IN PATIENT CARE MEANWHILE SEE THE PROFIT BUT IS THERE ARE YOU KNOW IS THERE IN INDUSTRY PHILOSOPHY ABOUT HOW. HOW MUCH IS REINVESTED BACK INTO INTO PATIENT CARE? AND HOW HOW DOES THAT WORK IN THE INDUSTRY. I WOULD SAY AGAIN LIKE I'VE I POINTED OUT EARLIER IN ORDER TO BUILD A NEW FACILITY IT'S A VERY LARGE INVESTMENT. BECAUSE YOU DO HAVE TO HAVE IT UP AND RUNNING FOR UPWARDS OF TWELVE MONTHS SO THERE'S A LOT OF INVESTMENT IN THAT. AND AGAIN BECAUSE UNFORTUNATELY IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE A GROWING POPULATION OF PATIENTS AND THAT ARE BECOMING. IN IN MEDIAN DIALYSIS TREATMENT AND SO THERE IS A LARGE INVESTMENT. THERE HAS BEEN IN THE PAST. IN BEING ABLE TO START UP NEW FACILITIES IN AREAS THAT NEED IT. IF THAT WILL CONTINUE AFTER THIS PASSES IT'S VERY HARD TO SAY. MY PLEASURE MORE INTERESTED IN THE ON THAT PUT PUT NEW FACILITIES DECIDE WHAT IS HOW MUCH IS REINVESTED IN ENSURING THAT PATIENTS ARE GETTING THE HIGHEST QUALITY CARE THAT WAS REALLY MORE MY QUESTION YEAH AND AND AGAIN THERE'S A LOT OF ADVANCEMENTS THAT ARE CURRENTLY BEING MADE THERE'S LOT. OF IMPROVEMENTS ALL THE MACHINES AND A LOT OF DIFFERENT OPTIONS FOR PATIENTS I MEAN AND PATIENTS CAN DIE LIES IN THE FACILITY OR THEY CAN ALSO VIOLATES AT HOME. AND THERE'S CONSTANTLY INVESTMENTS BEING MADE IN TRYING TO PRODUCE NEW MACHINES TO HELP WITH THAT PROCESS. SO I THINK THAT'S A NEW TECHNOLOGY IS A LOT OF AREAS WHERE YOU HAVE THE INVESTMENT ALSO. SO YES I GUESS I'M TRYING TO GET IS IT IS THERE A PAY PHILOSOPHY OF A. MEDICAL LOSS RATIO ASSOCIATED WITH WHICH TO WORK. THERE'D DEBT THERE'S. THERE'S NO NUMBER THERE'S NO NUMBER ASSOCIATED THAT MEANS NO PHILOSOPHY AROUND THAT I I DON'T KNOW ANY SPECIFIC NUMBER IT IT JUST DEPENDS ON. WHERE THEY WANT TO MAKE THE INVESTMENT IT EFFORTS IN DEVELOPING NEW PRODUCTS OR AND WORKING ON NEW TREATMENT PROTOCOLS? WOULD BE SPECIFIC TO EACH COMPANY. YOU MENTIONED A STUDY. WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO SHARE THAT WITH OUR COMMITTEE STAFF. SURE I DON' BELIEVE IT'S COMPLETE YET BUT IS SOON AS A STUDY IS COMPLETE I WOULD BE HAVE TAKEN WHAT ARE YOU GUYS. TO SEE IT SO A SECOND. HE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. PHONE BOOTH. WALDRON A LOT OF ITEMS IN ASK. HASN'T BEEN ASKED BUT I'M JUST YOU KNOW. LIKE ANY CLINIC THERE'S GONNA BE YOU KNOW PEOPLE WHO DEAL WITH ALL INSURANCE BILLING. YOU KNOW HIRING AND. I'M SURE HIGHER CLEANING STAFF AND THINGS LIKE THAT HOW IS THAT AFFECTED OR NOT. MY IS IN IT'S NOT RIGHT THAT WOULD BE LIKE ANY OF OUR HR OR IF WE. ARE ACCOUNTING SERVICES ARE IN BILLION OR YOU THINK THAT. THAT WOULD NOT BE INCLUDED. IN THE COST. SO IF A PATIENT I MEAN CAN A PATIENT SPEAK TO THOSE PEOPLE IF THEY HAVE AN ISSUE WITH THEIR INSURANCE OR. YOU KNOW THEY WORK WITH THEM SU YES CURRENTLY WE HAVE. STAFF THAT CAN HELP THEM EAT YOU KNOW EVEN JUST FILLING OUT FORMS ARTHUR CONFUSED OR IF THEY NEED HELP EXPLAINING THINGS AND EVEN TO SOME THEIR PERSONAL LIFE. YOU WE HAVE VARIOUS STAFF THAT CAN HELP THE PATIENTS AND. THAT IS A DIFFICULT PART THAT. IT IS. VERY LIMITED ON WHAT IS INCLUDED IN THAT COST TO DO THE CALCULATION. I'M. OKAY SO. ANOTHER ISSUE HARM. SOMETIMES THERE'S PATIENTS WHO COME IN AND THEY CAN ACTUALLY. DO THEIR DIALYSIS AT HOME. A IN THE EVENINGS. AND THEY'RE TRAINED YOU KNOW AGAINST TO THE CLINIC. I DON'T KNOW HOW OFTEN THEY COME INTO THE CLINIC. HOW WAS THAT AFFECTED IN THE INITIATIVE OUR IS IT IS LOOKING LIKE THIS? ENCOURAGED THAT STILL OR AFFECTED IN ANY WAY IS COVERED ON THE THE COST CAP WAS. YES ARE RIGHTS ARE UNDERSTANDING THAT THE HOME CARE IS INCLUDED AS A PART OF IT SO AGAIN. BANG THERE'S THAT DIFFICULTY WHEN YOU LOOK AT THAT AT THE COST. IT ONLY IS. WHAT SPECIFICALLY LISTED IT SAYS SHALL INCLUDE ONLY AND THE FOLLOWING AND NON MANAGERIAL? CRIED DALLAS'S CLINIC IN STAFF AND SO THAT'S THE PROBLEM IS THAT THERE ARE OTHER STAFF THAT DO WORK WITH PATIENTS AND ASSIST WITH OTHER PARTS OF THEIR CARE THAT ARE INCLUDED IN THE COST. OTHER PEOPLE AVAILABLE LIKE IN THEM IN THE NIGHT. YOU NO IF THEY HAVE QUESTION IF THERE HAVE BEEN ISSUE WHEN THEY'RE DOING AT HOME DIALYSIS YES OF COURSE. NEED THEIR TWO TYPES OF HOME DIALYSIS TO DO AND THERE'S TWENTY FOUR HOUR ON CALL NURSES OF COURSE THE PHYSICIAN IS ALWAYS ON CALL. LIGHT AND THERE'S ALSO. SUPPORT WITH TYPICALLY THAT THE COMPANY THAT MANAGES THE EQUIPMENT SO WHAT THAT'S BAXTER OR WHATEVER. SO THERE'S MULTIPLE AREAS. FOR RESOURCE. BUT ALSO. YOU MENTIONED HOME TREATMENTS. AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THESE. TO LARGE COMPANIES PROVIDE IS. FREE EDUCATION PRIOR TO DIALYSIS ON ALL THE TYPES OF. DIALYSIS MODALITY INCLUDING TRANSPLANT. AND SO THEY HAVE KIND OF A TEAM THAT'S A COMPLETELY FREE THING TO THE PATIENT. AND THEY CAN HAVE AS MANY SESSIONS AS THEY WANT. WHERE THEY THAT THE PATIENT COMES TO WHATEVER LOCATION THAT THAT TEAM HAS HAS BEEN USING? AND. THE PATIENT LEARNS THE INS AND OUTS OF OF THE TWO TYPES OF HOME TREATMENT THAT YOU ALLUDED TO. AS WELL AS DIETARY. EDUCATION AND EDUCATION ON TRANSPLANT AND ALL THAT HAPPENS. IN THE PRE DIALYSIS TIME PERIOD SO THAT COULD BE PATIENTS THAT ACTUALLY NEVER MAKE IT TO DIALYSIS ACTUALLY WERE ABLE TO KEEP THEM. YOU KNOW WITH KIDNEY FUNCTION GOOD ENOUGH TO STAY OFF THE MACHINE. BUT IT'S A PREPARATORY THINGS THAT THEY HAVE THE KNOWLEDGE AND EDUCATION WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT IS PROVIDED TO THEM THREE. AND THROUGH THE COMPANY'S. WHICH ON I DON'T KNOW IF THAT WOULD BE ABLE TO BE CONTINUE THAT'S AN INVESTMENT THAT WAS BROUGHT UP BEFORE. THINKING. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. I HAVE ONE FINAL QUESTION AND AND. THE. ALL THE START UP COSTS AND AND THE COST TO MAINTAIN A FACILITY WHAT'S GOING TO LICENSE SEEN ALL THOSE WOULD BE INCLUDED. AS. EXPENSES RELATED TO THE. TO THE CAP. CERTAINLY ARE ATTENTION THAT ANY OF THE COSTS THAT ARE RELATED THEIR TO THAT. RAMPING UP TOWARD A PATIENT CARE WOULD CERTAINLY. BE INCLUDED. FIFTH PATIENT CARE COSTS INCLUDE THE UTILITIES. A FACILITY IMPROVEMENTS. AND. WE DON'T SEE ANY REQUIREMENT THAT THE CLINICAL READY BE FULLY CMS CERTIFIED BEFORE THOSE COSTS CAN START TO COUNT TOWARD. THE ENTITY LEVEL PATIENT CARE COSTS. SO WE ACTUALLY SEE THIS AS CREATING AN INCENTIVE TO OPEN NEW CLINICS. ESPECIALLY AN AREA IN RURAL AREAS OR UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES WERE OTHERWISE THE ECONOMICS MIGHT NOT HAVE WORKED OUT. BECAUSE NOW WE ARE CREATING THAT ABILITY TO POOL THOSE PATIENT CARE COSTS WITH THE PATIENT CARE COSTS OF FACILITIES IN. AREAS WITH MORE RICH COMMERCIAL PAYER NEXUS. AND SO BECAUSE WE'RE CREATING AN ENTITY WIDE. PAYER MIX POOL. WE'RE HOPING THAT IT ENCOURAGES CLINICS IN RURAL AREAS IN UNDERSERVED AREAS TO OPEN. ANNE JEFFERY COMMENTS ON THE. BUT AGAIN I THINK IT'S JUST KIDS. DIFFICULT BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT YOU KNOW ALL THE COSTS ARE INCLUDED IN THERE'S OTHER THINGS THAT WE'VE MENTIONED. THAT WON'T BE INCLUDED AND OTHER STAFF AND FOR EACH INDIVIDUAL CLINIC ALTHOUGH IT IS LOOKED AT. AS A WHOLE IS A COMPANY. THE COMINGS AND LOOK AT EACH INDIVIDUAL CLINIC AND WORST LOCATED THAT HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION. YOU KNOW AT THAT CLINIC ITSELF IS ECONOMICALLY VIABLE. THE OTHER QUESTIONS. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATED. AT THIS POINT WE'RE GONNA GO TO PUBLIC COMMENT. I WILL BE ASKING PEOPLE JUST YOUR NAME. AND POSITION ON THE INITIATIVE PLEASE ARE WE READY. ANY TIME THAT.

THERE WERE FORWARD I THINK WE CAN. CAN NO THE PROCESS NOW SO. GIVE US GIVE JUST A SECOND TO OKAY FOR TO GO AHEAD. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AGAIN RYAN WILL THE WITH THE LA NO AND WILL BE. PRESENTING AS BEFORE JUST A QUICK BACKGROUND ON THE MEASURE I'LL. SKIP THROUGH AND DESCRIBING OUR OWN THE PROCESS SINCE WE DID THAT ON THE LAST ONE. STRAIGHT TO THE BACKGROUND ON THE MEASURE. STATE LAW. IDENTIFIES EIGHT PRIVATE NONPROFIT HOSPITALS AND THE CHILDREN'S PROGRAMS THAT THE FIVE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA ACADEMIC MEDICAL CENTER CAMPUSES AS CHILDREN'S HOSPITALS. AND THESE HOSPITALS FOCUS ON TREATING INJURED DISABLED. AND SICK INFANTS AND CHILDREN AND THE MAJORITY OF THEIR FUNDING COMES FROM THE FEDERAL STATE MEDICAID PROGRAM. THEY ALSO RECEIVE FUNDING FROM COMMERCIAL HEALTH COVERAGE. OTHER GOVERNMENT HEALTH COVERAGE PROGRAMS PRIVATE DONATIONS. AND TO NAME A FEW. AND THE UC MEDICAL CENTERS. DO APPEAR ACCORDING TO BUDGET DOCUMENTS RECEIVE A SMALL AMOUNT OF STATE SUPPORT. ONE OF THE GOVERNMENT COVERAGE PROGRAMS THAT WILL SPECIALLY MENTION IS THAT CALIFORNIA'S CHILDREN SERVICE SERVICES PROGRAM WHICH. AND PAYS FOR SPECIALIZED TREATMENT AND OTHER SERVICES FOR CHILDREN WITH SPECIAL HEALTHCARE NEEDS. AND. AND WILL ALSO NOTE AT THIS POINT THAT IN ADDITION TO THE. THIRTEEN SPECIFICALLY IDENTIFIED CHILDREN'S HOSPITALS MANY OTHER HOSPITALS IN THE STATE HAM. ALSO FOCUS TO VARYING DEGREES ON TREATING CHILDREN AND MANY OF THEM. ARE APPROVED TO TREAT CHILDREN THE CCS PROGRAM. SOME OF THESE HOSPITALS ARE OPERATED BY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS SUCH AS. LOCAL HEALTH CARE DISTRICTS AND THOSE DISTRICTS DO YOU PROVIDE SOME LOCAL GOVERNMENT FUNDING SUPPORT. AND THEY JUST REALLY BRIEFLY. BACKGROUND ON ON BONDS AND THE STATE MAY BORROW TO PAY FOR LONG TERM CAPITAL PROJECTS BY ISSUING GENERAL OBLIGATION BONDS. AND THE STATE REPAYS THESE BONDS USING. GENERAL FUND DOLLARS AND THEY MUST BE APPROVED BY A MAJORITY OF VOTERS. AND IN THE PAST THIS AND VOTERS HAVE TWICE PREVIOUSLY APPROVED. STATE GENERAL OBLIGATION BONDS. FOR CAPITAL PROJECTS AT THE THIRTEEN CHILDREN'S HOSPITALS AND THERE WAS SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS APPROVED IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR THROUGH PROPOSITION SIXTY ONE. AND AN ADDITIONAL NINE HUNDRED EIGHTY MILLION APPROVED IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT THROUGH PROPOSITION THREE. AND FUNDS FROM THESE PREVIOUS MEASURES. ARE ANTICIPATED TO BE FULLY COMMITTED TO PROJECTS HAT. I'M ELIGIBLE HOSPITALS BY THE END OF THE SUMMER. ON PAGE FOUR. WE DESCRIBE. HOW THE FUNDING FROM THIS MEASURE WHICH WOULD PROVIDE ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN GENERAL OBLIGATION BOND FUNDING FOR CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS WOULD BE ALLOCATED. AND AS WITH THE PREVIOUS MEASURES. CERTAIN AMOUNTS ARE SET ASIDE FOR THE PRIVATE NONPROFIT CHILDREN'S HOSPITALS AND THE FIVE. UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA CHILDREN'S HOSPITALS AND IN THE AMOUNTS THAT ARE SHOWN IN THE TABLE. UNLIKE THE PREVIOUS TWO MEASURES AND THE MEASURE THAT. WE'RE DISCUSSING TODAY WOULD ADDITIONALLY PROVIDE ONE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS. OF FUNDING. FOR. ROUGHLY ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY PUBLIC AND PRIVATE NONPROFIT HOSPITALS THAT PROVIDE SERVICES TO CHILDREN IN THE CALIFORNIA CHILDREN SERVICES PROGRAM. AND FOR THAT THIRTEEN HOSPITALS AMOUNTS ARE DOWN A FIGHT IN THE MEASURE THAT THE HOSPITALS COULD. APPLY FOR FUNDING UP TO AM NO SPECIFIC AMOUNT IS IDENTIFIED IN THE MEASURE FOR THE ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY OR SO. AND OTHER HOSPITALS THAT WOULD BE MORE ON A COMPETITIVE BASIS. I'M ON PAGE FIVE AND BRIEFLY THE FUNDS. ARE ALLOWED BY THE MEASURE. AND TO BE USED FOR VARIOUS PURPOSES AND SOME THAT ARE OUTLINED IN THE MEASURE INCLUDE CONSTRUCTION EXPANSION REMODELING RENOVATION. REFINANCING AND TO NAME SOME EXAMPLES HOSPITALS WOULD APPLY AND TO RECEIVE THESE FUNDS TO THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH FACILITIES FINANCING AUTHORITY. WHICH OPERATES OUT OF THE STATE TREASURER'S OFFICE. AND. THIS AUTHORITY WOULD. DECIDE WHETHER TO AWARD A GRANT BASED ON VARIOUS FACTORS AND INCLUDING THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE. FUNDS WOULD HELP. IMPROVE ACCESS FOR CHILDREN AND THEY'RE ELIGIBLE FOR GOVERNMENT HEALTH PROGRAMS AND WHETHER IT WOULD IMPROVE CHILD HEALTH OR OTHER PEDIATRIC PATIENT OUTCOMES OR WHETHER IT WOULD PROMOTE. PEDIATRIC OR RESEARCH PROGRAMS. AT AT THE HOSPITALS. IN TERMS THE FISCAL EFFECTS AND THERE WOULD BE SOME STATE BOND REPAYMENT COSTS WHICH AND WE ESTIMATE WOULD TOTAL TWO POINT NINE BILLION DOLLARSTO PAY OFF BOTH THE PRINCIPLE OF ONE POINT FIVE BILLION. AND THE INTEREST OF ONE POINT FOUR BILLION. OVER THIRTY FIVE YEAR PERIOD AND THIS. PENCILS OUT TO ABOUT EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS. OF GENERAL FUND COST ANNUALLY. WE ALSO WOULD JUST KNOW THAT SINCE SOME OF THE HOSPITALS THAT WOULD BE APPLYING FOR THESE FUNDS TO RECEIVE. STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT SUPPORT IT IS POSSIBLE THAT IN SOME CASES RECEIVING FUNDS FOR THIS MEASURE WOULD AFFECT THE. AND OTHER STATE LOCAL GOVERNMENT FUNDS THAT ARE AND INVOLVED WITH THOSE HOSPITALS FOR EXAMPLE AT. A DISTRICT HOSPITAL MIGHT. PURSUE AT SOME FUTURE POINT DOWN ITS OWN BOND MEASURE TO FINANCE CONSTRUCTION THAT MIGHT BE LESS BECAUSE THEY RECEIVE FUNDS FROM FROM THIS MEASURE. AND WITH THAT WOULD HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THE QUESTION. SIR. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON. I'M MY NAME IS OUT RONALD WASHINGTON I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF DAY CALIFORNIA EDUCATIONAL FACILITIES AUTHORITY. I'M OUT OF THE TREASURES OFFICE UNDER TREASURER JOHN CHIANG. AND THEN WITH ME TODAY AS CAROLINE APPROVAL SHAR SHE'S THE ARE THE PROGRAM MANAGER OVER. CHAFFETZ GRANT PROGRAMS. SO WHERE I AM HAPPY TO BE HERE TODAY. AND I'M JUST SORT OF THERE AND ONTO WHAT RYAN IS. INDICATED. I'D LIKE TO JUST PROVIDE JUST A GENERAL OVERVIEW OF THE OF. THE SUCCESS OF. THE PROP SIXTY ONE IN AND PROP THREE PROGRAMS AND THEN. TALK TO YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT CHAPTER DOES IN OUR RESPONSIBILITY OVER THE ON THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL GRANT PROGRAM. AND THEN MAYBE JUST BRIEFLY. TOUCH ON. AN ITEM OR TWO ON. THE BALLOT INITIATIVE AND THEN WE'RE HAPPY OF COURSE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE ON THE PROGRAM. SO. AS YOU KNOW. CHAPTER HAS ALREADY. ADMINISTER TO GRANT PROGRAMS A PROP SIXTY ONE AND PROP THREE BARNES. INITIATIVES. EACH OF THOSE PROGRAMS ARE. ARE RUN OUT OF IT. I CHAPLAIN THE CHARGES OFFICE AND THE EACH ARE RUN. FAIRLY IDENTICALLY THE THE DIFFERENCES ARE IN EACH OF THOSE PROGRAMS ARE JUST THAT DOLLAR AMOUNT. OUTSIDE OF THE DOLLAR AMOUNT ON EACH OF THE PROGRAMS. WERE. DIVIDED EIGHTY PERCENT TO THE NONPROFIT HOSPITALS AND TWENTY PERCENT. TWO THE I'M THE FIVE YOU SEE HOSPITALS. WE ARE HAPPY TO ANNOUNCE THAT OF THE FUNDS FOR. OTHER PROP SIXTY ONE WHICH WAS SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION. AND HAS ALL BEEN FULLY COMMITTED TO SO WE HAVE A WAR AT ALL OF THOSE FUNDS. AND THEN WE EXPECT ALSO WANTED A PROP THREE. THE NINE HUNDRED EIGHTY MILLION DOLLAR A PORTION OF THAT PROGRAM. I WE FULLY EXPECT THAT BY THE END OF JUNE THIRTIETH WE WILL HAVE AWARDED. ALL THE FUNDS FOR THEIR PROGRAM. SO WE BOMB. AND WE HAVE SEEN. I LOUDEST PROCESS AND HOW WE HAVE RUN THE PROGRAMS WERE PLEASED. OUR TO SEE ANOTHER. INITIATIVE ON THE BALLOT I'M AS WE HAVE WORKED OUR WAY THROUGH. THREE SEPARATE FUNDING ROUNDS. THERE PROP SIXTY ONE AND THEN ANOTHER FUNDING ROUND ON THE PROP THREE. SO. I'M NOT JUST SORT OF A GENERAL OVERVIEW OF THE PROGRAM. ARE CHECK FOR THOSE RUN OBVIOUSLY OTHER BONDING AND LOAN PROGRAMS BUT THIS GRANT PROGRAM PARTICULAR HAS BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL. AND WE HAVE WORKED WITH. TO CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION AS WELL AS. THE CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION ON. ON THIS MEASURE AND SPECIFICALLY WHAT TO CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION. WITH THE EXISTING I'M A CHILDREN'S HOSPITALS. AND SO JUST BRIEFLY ARM I WANNA JUST TOUCH ON REALLY WHAT SHOPPERS ROLE. HAS BEEN ON THE TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT BALLOT MEASURE. AND THAT WOULD ALSO THEN BE CONSISTENT WITH. OF THE INITIATIVE. FOR TODAY. AND REALLY SORT OF ONE OF OUR OUR PRIMARY OBJECTIVES IS TO REALLY DEVELOP. REGULATIONS THROUGH THE OFFICE OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW FOR EACH OF THESE PROGRAMS. THEY ARE. PROGRAMS THAT WE ASK SO THAT EACH OF THE HOSPITALS COMPLY TO THOSE REGULATIONS. EACH OF THE THIRTEEN HOSPITALS HAS. SEE. SUCCESS THROUGH EACH THOSE REGULATORY PROCESSES. AND SO ON WILL CONTINUE THAT ON THE. THIS INITIAL. LOOK AT THE ARM. THE I'M INITIATIVE AS BEING CONSIDERED TODAY. OTHER ITEM THAT I WANT TO MENTION IS THAT SO WE HAVE AN APPLICATION PROCESS THAT WE GO THROUGH AND. WE DEVELOP GRANT AGREEMENTS ALL THE DOCUMENTS RELATED TO EACH OF THE PROGRAMS. ARE. CHAFF ABOARD THEN APPROVES. EACH OF A OUR RECOMMENDATIONS MADE BY STAFF AND THEN STABBING WORKS BUT ARE SPECIFICALLY WITH EACH OF AT THIRTEEN HOSPITALS. IN ORDER TO. ACCESS THOSE GRANT FUNDS AND THEN. FOR A SUCCESSFUL A DEVELOPMENT OR RE FABRICATION ARE PROJECTS OR BUILDING UP THOSE FACILITIES. SO. THAT'S REALLY OUR OUR ROLE. ARE WITH THE PROJECT. AND THEN JUST BRIEFLY THIS. THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL BOND ACTOR TWENTY EIGHTEEN IS VIRTUALLY IDENTICAL TO OBVIOUSLY OTHER TO BOND ACTS WITH THE EXCEPTION BEING. A RATHER THAN IT BEING A TWENTY EIGHTY SPLAYED IT IS A. SEVENTY TWO EIGHTEEN SPLIT WITH THE TEN PERCENT AS RYAN MENTION. BEING SET ASIDE FOR ON THE OTHER. PUBLIC AND PRIVATE NON PROFIT HOSPITALS. THAT TREAT. OF THOSE WITH AYE CCS SERVICES. BUT. THEY ARE AGAIN. ARM IN EVERY EVERY OTHER RESPECT IDENTICAL TO EACH OF THE TWO BAR PROGRAMS WHICH WE HAVE SEEN. OF SIGNIFICANT SUCCESS ON SO. WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING ON THIS INITIATIVE AND. I WITH THE HOSPITALS THAT WILL BE COMING FORWARD AND. IT REALLY SUPPORT THIS AFTER. AND WE CAN ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SEEN NO QUESTIONS AT THIS TIME. WILL MOVE ONTO THE PROPONENTS. ITEM NUMBER FOUR. WE HAVE ANNA LOUISE COONS PRESIDENCY ó CALIFORNIA CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL WE HAVE. JENNA JENSEN SHE FONG GOVERNMENT RELATIONS CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL ORANGE COUNTY AND JENNIFER PAIGE PARENT AND PARENT IT CHILDRENS HOSPITAL OF LOS ANGELES. AND PLEASE PROCEED WELCOME. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN GOOD AFTERNOON. I AM INCLUDES AN ON THE PRESIDENCY OF THE CALIFORNIA CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION AS YOU MENTIONED WITH ME TODAY AGENDA JOHNSON THE CHIEF GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS OFFICER FOR TALK CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL IN ORANGE COUNTY AND JENNIFER PAIGE THE PARENT OF A CHILD WHO HAS BEEN TREATED FOR THE PAST THIRTEEN YEARS AT. CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL LOS ANGELES. THE CALIFORNIA CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION IS PLEASED TO BE SPONSORING THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL BOND ACTIVE TWENTY EIGHTEEN. A BOND MEASURE THAT WE EXPECT TO QUALIFY FOR THE NOVEMBER BALLOT. THE ACT WILL PROVIDE UP TO ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS TO EXPAND AND RENOVATE CHILDREN CALIFORNIA'S CHILDREN'S HOSPITALS AND TO PURCHASE STATE OF THE ART LIFESAVING MEDICAL EQUIPMENT. TO TREAT MOST SERIOUSLY ILL AND INJURED CHILDREN IN THE STATE. EVERY YEAR CALIFORNIA'S CHILDREN'S HOSPITALS TREAT OVER ONE MILLION CHILDREN'S IN INJURIES AND ILLNESSES WITHOUT REGARD TO FAMILIES ABILITY TO PAY. OUR HOSPITALS PROVIDE SPECIALIZED CARE TO TREAT CHILDREN AND YOUNG ADULTS. ADULTS WITH THE MOST SERIOUS AND LIFE THREATENING ILLNESSES LIKE CHILDHOOD LEUKEMIA HEART DEFECTS. SICKLE CELL DISEASE DIABETES AND CYSTIC FIBROSIS. CCJ MEMBER HOSPITALS PERFORM NINETY SEVEN PERCENT OF ALL PEDIATRIC ORGAN TRANSPLANTS. AND NINETY SIX PERCENT OF ALL PEDIATRIC HEART SURGERIES. AND CONDUCT SEVENTY SIX PERCENT OF ALL PEDIATRIC CANCER TREATMENTS IN CALIFORNIA. THEY ALSO SERVICE REGIONAL TERTIARY CARE AND TRAUMA CENTERS. FINALLY THERE ARE SOME OF THE NATION'S PREMIER PEDIATRIC RESEARCH CENTERS MAKING THEM A MAJOR SOURCE OF SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERIES IN BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH BENEFITING ALL CHILDREN. CALIFORNIA'S CHILDREN'S HOSPITALS FACE PARTICULAR CHALLENGES WHEN IT COMES TO FINANCING INFRASTRUCTURE. MEDI CAL WHICH IS ONE OF THE MOST PIN URAEUS PAIRS IN THE NATION IS RESPONSIBLE FOR REIMBURSING ABOUT SIXTY SIX PERCENT OF ALL OF OUR HOSPITAL STAYS. THIS IS TWICE THE STATEWIDE AVERAGE FOR ALL HOSPITALS. IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO SET ASIDE MONNING FOR BUILDINGS AND EQUIPMENT WITH THAT PAYER MIX. AT THE SAME TIME PUBLIC AND NONPROFIT CHILDREN'S HOSPITALS DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO EQUITY MARKETS IN THE WAY THAT FOR PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS DO. THIS IS WHY WE'RE SEEKING ACCESS TO BOND FUNDS FOR LARGE SCALE INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS THAT BENEFIT CHILDREN THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL BOND ACTOR TWENTY EIGHTEEN WILL BUILD ON THE SUCCESS OF TWO PREVIOUS CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL BONDS. PROPOSITION SIXTY ONE WHICH REYES SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION FOR CHILDREN'S HOSPITALS IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR. AND PROPOSITION THREE WHICH MILLION DOLLARS FOR CHILDREN'S HOSPITALS IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT. THESE PREVIOUS BOND PROGRAMS ENABLE THEIR HOSPITALS TO BILL PATIENT TOWERS THAT MEET TWENTY THIRTY SEISMIC STANDARDS PURCHASE NEW EQUIPMENT INCLUDING IT SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE. AND ACQUIRE NEW MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY FOR THINGS LIKE PET SCANS. THE RESULT IS THAT CHILDREN'S HOSPITALS HAVE MADE SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS IN MODERNIZING FACILITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THESE FUNDS HAVE NOW BEEN DISPERSED TO FINANCE PROJECTS THAT WERE LONG OVERDUE. IN THE INTERVENING TEN YEARS DEMAND FOR OUR SERVICES HAS GROWN AND TECHNOLOGY HAS CONTINUED TO EVOLVE. CHILDREN'S HOSPITALS ARE SEEING MORE AND MORE REFERRALS FROM LOCAL COMMUNITY HOSPITALS AS REGIONALIZATION OF PEDIATRIC SPECIALTY CARE IN CALIFORNIA HAS INTENSIFIED. IN ADDITION WE ARE SEEING CHILDREN WITH MEDICAL COMPLEXITY LIVE LONGER BUT WITH CONTINUED NEED FOR MEDICAL CARE. FOR EXAMPLE CHILDREN WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS DID NOT USE TO SURVIVE PAST EARLY ADOLESCENCE BUT ARE NOW LIVING WELL INTO ADULTHOOD. SIMILARLY VERY PREMATURE BABIES ARE NOW SURVIVING IN SITUATIONS THAT WOULD NOT OF IMPOSSIBLE A DECADE AGO. BUT THEY'RE LIVING WITH LIFELONG MEDICAL NEEDS THAT REQUIRE CONTINUE TREATMENTS FOR NEUROLOGICAL IMPAIRMENTS. THESE TRENDS HAVE MEANT THAT SOME OF OUR HOSPITALS ARE OPERATING AT CLOSE TO CAPACITY FOR MANY MONTHS OF THE YEAR. AT THE SAME TIME THE COST OF HOSPITAL CONSTRUCTION CONTINUES TO INCREASE WHICH MAKES ALL OF THESE NEEDED IMPROVEMENTS IN EXPANSIONS MORE EXPENSIVE. WE ESTIMATE THAT OUR HOSPITAL CONSTRUCTION COSTS HAVE GROWN BY THIRTY FIVE PERCENT SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT. AND THAT CONSTRUCTION COSTS FOR BETTER NOW ABOUT THREE MILLION DOLLARS. BASED ON THESE TRENDS WE HAVE BUILT A FISCAL ESTIMATE FOR FUTURE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS OVER THE NEXT FIFTEEN YEARS. THESE INCLUDE FIRST BUILDING CAPACITY IN SPECIALTY AREAS WHERE THE NEED IS GROWING. LIKE CARDIAC LABS FOR CHILDREN WITH CONGENITAL HEART ABNORMALITIES AND OUTPATIENT CLINICS FOR CHILDREN WITH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH NEEDS. SO THAT WAIT TIMES FOR SERVICES ARE REDUCED. SECOND ADDING ADDITIONAL BEDS IN HOSPITALS THAT ARE NEAR CAPACITY. AND THIRD MAKING SURE THAT ALL HOSPITAL BUILDINGS MEET THE MOST STRINGENT STANDARDS FOR SEISMIC SAFETY. IT WILL ALSO BE USED TO ENSURE THAT CHILDREN'S HOSPITALS HAVE THE MOST UP TO DATE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES SO THAT CHILDREN'S MEDICAL RECORDS CAN BE APPROPRIATELY ACCESSED AND SECURED. AS THE LA OR DESCRIBE THE ACT WILL PROVIDE HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TO EACH OF THE EIGHT FREESTANDING NOT FOR PROFIT CHILDREN'S HOSPITALS IN FIFTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS TO EACH OF THE FIVE PUBLIC UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA CHILDREN'S HOSPITALS. THIS ALLOCATION IS BASED ON THE APPROXIMATE SPLIT OF HOSPITAL BEDS BETWEEN THIS TWO TYPES OF HOSPITALS. JACK WILL ALSO PROVIDE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION TO ADDRESS PEDIATRIC INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS AND OTHER PUBLIC AND NONPROFIT HOSPITALS IN CALIFORNIA THAT SERVE CHILDREN IN THE CALIFORNIA CHILDREN SERVICES PROGRAM. THESE FUNDS WILL BE AVAILABLE TO ELIGIBLE HOSPITALS FOR PERIOD OF UP TO FIFTEEN YEARS. IT'S IMPORTANT NOTE THAT THE CALIFORNIA THAT THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL BOND AFTER TWENTY EIGHTEEN HAS STRICT OVERSIGHT CRITERIA TO ENSURE THESE FUNDS CAN ONLY BE USED FOR INFRASTRUCTURE AND ONLY FOR PROJECT PROJECTS THAT WILL IMPROVE PEDIATRIC ACCESS AND HEALTH CARE OUTCOMES. ALL REQUESTS FOR FUNDS MUST BE CAREFULLY REVIEWED AND APPROVED BY CHAFF AS MISTER WASHINGTON JUST DESCRIBED. IN ADDITION PERIODIC REVIEWS BY THE INDEPENDENT BUREAU OF STATE AUDITS INSURERS THAT FUNDS ARE USED APPROPRIATELY. AUDITS A PREVIOUS CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL BOND PROJECTS HAVE DETERMINED THAT THE PRIDE PROGRAM IS OPERATING CONSISTENT WITH THE LAW. THE PURPOSE OF THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL BOND ACT IS TO ENSURE THAT CHILDREN'S HOSPITALS CAN ACQUIRE THE TECHNOLOGY AND NOW THE CAPACITY TO MEET THE MEDICAL NEEDS OF THE MOST MEDICALLY COMPLEX CHILDREN AND ULTIMATELY SAVE MORE LIVES. WE HOPE YOU WILL CONSIDER SUPPORTING IT. WITH YOUR PERMISSION MISTER CHAIRMAN I'D LIKE TO ASK MS JOHNSON AND THE MRS PAGE TO MAKE SOME COMMENTS AND THEN WE'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR WOULD CHAIR HERNANDEZ AND MEMBER SIDE AS AND SAID JANET JANSEN WITH TALK CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL WHICH IS AN ORANGE COUNTY CALIFORNIA. I'M CHIEF GOVERNMENT RELATIONS OFFICER AND I'D BEEN WITH CHALK FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS. I AM SO I WAS AT CHALK WHEN WE PASSED PROP THREE AND PROP SIXTY ONE IN THOSE DOLLARS CAME IN AND WE USE THOSE DOLLARS TO BUILD A NEW TOWER TO TAKE CARE OF CHILDREN ORANGE COUNTY THE BILL HOMES TOWER. IS FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND SQUARE FEET WE OPENED IT AND TWENTY THIRTEEN AND IT REALLY CHANGED THE FACE OF PEDIATRIC MEDICINE AND ORANGE COUNTY. IT ALLOWED US TO BRING SOME VERY IMPORTANT SERVICES INTO OUR HOSPITAL FOR THE FIRST TIME. PRIOR TO OPENING THE BILL HOMES TOWER WE SHARED EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT OPERATING ROOM LAB. RADIOLOGY WITH OUR NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOR AND SEEN JOSEPH HOSPITAL SHE IS A WONDERFUL PARTNERSHIP FOR MANY MANY YEARS BY. WAS VERY IMPORTANT FOR US TO BE ABLE TO BRING THOSE SERVICES INTO OUR OWN HOSPITAL BECAUSE WITHOUT WE WERE ABLE TO PROVIDE. SALINAS THERE REALLY DESIGNED SPECIFICALLY FOR CHILDREN AND STAFF THAT IS SPECIFICALLY TRAINED TO TAKE CARE OF CHILDREN SO IT REALLY DID CHANGE THE WAY WE PROVIDE CARE AT CHALK CHILDREN'S. AND IN ADDITION. I ONE YEAR AFTER OPENING THAT BUILDING WE WERE ABLE TO BECOME THE FIRST DESIGNATED PEDIATRIC TRAUMA CENTER THAT ORANGE COUNTY HAS EVER HAD THAT WAS A VERY IMPORTANT SERVICE TO PROVIDE FOR OUR COMMUNITY THAT WE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO. WITHOUT HAVING OUR OWN EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT AND IT'S BEEN A GREAT SUCCESS. SO IT HAS BEEN JUST A TREMENDOUS BENEFIT TO THE CHILDREN OF OUR COMMUNITY AND TO THOSE DOLLARS FROM PROP THREE AND PROPS PROP SIXTY ONE REALLY ALLOWED US. TO MOVE FORWARD WITHOUT PROJECT. SO A LITTLE BIT I WANT TO TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT'S NEXT FOR US SO WHAT KIND OF PRIORITIES ARE ON THE HORIZON FOR CHALK CHILDREN'S AND I NEED TO TELL YOU THAT ONE OF OUR BIGGEST PRIORITIES RIGHT NOW. IS PEDIATRIC AND ADOLESCENT MENTAL HEALTH. WE KNOW THAT ONE IN FIVE CHILDREN SUFFERS A DIAGNOSABLE MENTAL HEALTH DISORDER. AND THAT SUICIDE IS THE SECOND LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH AMONG BOTH CHILDREN AGES TEN TO FOURTEEN AS WELL AS FIFTEEN TO TWENTY FOUR RIGHT NOW IN OUR COUNTRY. ON BEHALF OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE MENTAL ILLNESS IN ADULTHOOD DID EXPERIENCE SYMPTOMS BY AGE FOURTEEN. AND YET ONLY ONE THIRD OF THOSE FOLKS RECEIVED OF HELP THEY NEEDED AND CHILDHOOD AND THAT CONTINUES TO BE A HUGE PROBLEM. AND YOU ALSO MIGHT SURPRISE BE SURPRISED TO KNOW THAT IT TAKES AN AVERAGE OF TEN YEARS TO DIAGNOSE. A PEDIATRIC MENTAL HEALTH DISORDERS TO WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IF WE HAD ANY OTHER CHRONIC DISEASE. THAT WE WERE LETTING GO FOR TEN YEARS BEFORE WE IDENTIFIED AND TREATED IT YOU CAN JUST IMAGINE HOW. THESE THINGS BECOME OUT OF CONTROL AND WE WOULD NOT TOLERATE IT WITH ANY OTHER DIAGNOSIS AND WE SHOULDN'T TOLERATE IT WITH MENTAL HEALTH. SO THREE YEARS AGO WE LAUNCHED A COMPREHENSIVE MENTAL HEALTH INITIATIVE THAT CHALK CHILDREN'S WE STARTED OUT BY CONVENING A LARGE MULTI DISCIPLINARY TASK FORCE FROM COMMUNITY MEMBERS TO ADVISE US AND HELP US SET PRIORITIES. WE NEED TO MOVE FORWARD WITH INTENSIVE OUTPATIENT SERVICES. AND THEN JUST RECENTLY WE OPENED OUR COUNTIES FIRST PEDIATRIC MENTAL HEALTH UNIT WE SERVE CHILDREN BETWEEN AGES THREE AND SEVENTEEN. IT'S AN EIGHTEEN BED UNIT WITH ALL PRIVATE ROOMS WE OPENED IT JUST ABOUT THREE OR FOUR WEEKS AGO I WOULD SAY. AND SO WITH THE OPENING OF THIS ITEM WE INCREASE THE CAPACITY FOR OUR STATES. A MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR CHILDREN UNDER TWELVE BY EIGHTEEN PERCENT. BEFORE THAT THERE WERE ONLY ONE HUNDRED BEDS FOR CHILDREN UNDER TWELVE IN OUR STATE AND WE HAVE SIX MILLION CHILDREN UNDER TWELVE IN OUR STATE. SO I KNOW YOU KNOW THAT WAS NOT ENOUGH SO WAS A BIG DEAL TO OPEN THOSE BEDS. THE FIRST PATIENT WE ADMITTED WAS JUST FIVE YEARS OLD. THAT CHILD HAD BEEN SITTING IN AN EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT FOR QUITE SOME TIME WAITING FOR CARE. AND THERE WERE REALLY NOT ANY GOOD OPTIONS ON THE HORIZON FOR THAT CHILD SO WE WERE VERY GLAD TO BE ABLE TO OPEN OUR DOORS AND TAKE CARE OF THAT CHILD. SECOND PATIENT WAS ONLY EIGHT YEARS OLD. WE NO THIS UNIT IS GOING TO BE FULL WITHIN MONTHS WE HAD A WAITING LIST WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS OF CHILDREN WHO NEEDED TO GET INTO THE UNIT. AND WE KNOW THE NEED IS CONTINUING TO GROW. WE ALSO BEGAN SCREENING ALL CHILDREN. OVER THE AGE OF ELEVEN WHO COME INTO OUR EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT FOR ANY REASON AT ALL. SO IF THAT ELEVEN YEAR OLD OR OLDER CON SAN WITH A BROKEN BONE OR WITH A HIGH FEVER ORREALLY ANYTHING AT ALL. OUR STAFF SCREENS THEM TO FIND OUT IF THEY'VE BEEN EXPERIENCING SUICIDAL THOUGHTS IF THEY'VE SUICIDAL IDEATION. STUNNINGLY IN THE FIRST THREE WEEKS THAT WE STARTED CONDUCTING THE SCREENING WE HAD EIGHTY FIVE CHILDREN TELL US THAT THEY HAD BEEN HAVING THESE THOUGHTS. MANY OF THEIR PARENTS WERE EXTREMELY SHOCKED IN FACT MOST OF THEM WERE EXTREMELY SHOCKED AND WE CONTINUE TO HAVE A TEN TO TWELVE PERCENT POSITIVE SCREENING RATE. AND ARE MERCHANTS THE DEPARTMENT WITH KIDS WHO WE ASK THAT QUESTION OF. SO WE'VE DONE A LOT BUT WE NEED TO DO MORE AND WE WANT TO DO MORE IN THIS IMPORTANT AREA. WE NEED MORE OUTPATIENT THERAPY WE OPENED AN INTENSIVE OUTPATIENT PROGRAM AND WE FILLED IT UP WITHIN WEEKS THAT PROGRAM IS FOR TEENAGERS WHO ARE EXPERIENCING A SERIOUS DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY. WE NEED MORE INPATIENT BEDS WE KNOW WE NEED INPATIENT PSYCH BEDS AND OTHER PARTS OF OUR COUNTY THAT CURRENTLY AREN'T BEING SERVED CLOSE TO HOME. AND THEN WE NEED BETTER SERVICES AND MORE SERVICES FOR CHILDREN WITH AUTISM. WE RECENTLY AND RECEIVED A TEN MILLION DOLLAR LEAD GETS TO OPEN IN NEW AUTISM CENTER A CHALK CHILDREN'S AUTISM CENTER. AND AROUND THE CORNER FROM OUR HOSPITAL. WE KNOW TEN MILLION DOLLARS IS A GREAT START BUT WE'RE GONNA NEED MORE FUNDS TO REALLY OPEN AND EQUIPPED DOT. FACILITY AND WE'RE GONNA NEED TO SURROUND IT WITH OTHER SUPPORTIVE SERVICES ESPECIALLY FOR CHILDREN BETWEEN THE AGES OF. I ZERO ONE EIGHT SO CHILDREN UP TO EIGHT THAT'S WHERE WE HAVE THE POST THE BEST CHANCE. TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE FOR KIDS WITH AUTISM AND YET THOSE HIGH ACCESS TO THOSE SERVICES IS REALLY AN ADEQUATE AND OUR STATE SO WE'RE EAGER TO DO THAT. SO THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL BOND WOULD REALLY GIVE US A HUGE HEAD START. TO TRY AND MEET ALL THESE NEEDS THAT WE'VE NEWMAN AND NUMERATORS WE ALSO NEED. BETTER ACCESS AND MORE ACCESS TO SPECIALTY CARE SERVICES WE NEED MORE ACCESS TO OUTPATIENT SERVICES BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT'S WHERE THE DEMAND IS MOVING. AND WE ALSO NEED TO INVEST IN INNOVATIVE PROGRAMS THAT ARE GOING TO BRING OUR SERVICES INTO THE COMMUNITY WHERE AND WHEN FAMILIES NEED THEM AND WANT THEM NOW. AND HIS AND TOLD YOU THE DEMAND FOR SERVICES IS GROWING BUT IT'S A GOOD STORY IT'S A STORY ABOUT SAVING CHILDREN'S LIVES WHEN I STARTED WORKING AT CHOCOLATES AND SAT I REMEMBER. THAT VERY YOUNG KIDS WERE DYING FROM CYSTIC FIBROSIS WE HAD A LOT OF KIDS WHO WOULD DIE FROM LEUKEMIA AND NOW I'VE SEEN THE CURE RATES JUST SKYROCKET. SO WE'RE TAKING CARE OF THESE KIDS THEY NEED ONGOING CARE SO THEY'RE SURVIVING BUT THEY NEED CONTINUING CARE FROM US AND THAT IS ONE REASON WHY THE DEMAND FOR SERVICES IS GROWING. WE'RE ALSO SEEING OTHER HOSPITALS IN THE COMMUNITY RIGHTLY AND IMPORTANTLY FOCUSING ON AGING POPULATION WE SEE A SHIFT OF FOCUS TO CAPACITY FOR THAT GROWING SEGMENT OF AGING ADULTS. AND THEREFORE WE SEE EVEN A GREATER NEED FOR CHILDREN'S HOSPITALS TO BE THERE FOR CHILDREN AND WE WANT TO BE THERE AND WE'RE EXCITED ABOUT BEING THERE FOR THEM. BUT WE'RE GOING TO NEED SOME HELP TO DO IT BECAUSE AT CHALK FOR SIXTY FIVE PERCENT NOT A COW AND WE KNOW WE'RE NOT GOING TO GET THERE ON MEDI CAL REIMBURSEMENT. SO FOR ALL THESE REASONS WERE ASKING VOTERS TO VOTE YES ON CHILDREN'S HOSPITALS IN NOVEMBER AND WE HOPE YOU'LL SUPPORT US AS WELL THANK YOU SO MUCH. MY NAME IS JENNIFER PAIGE AND I HAVE THE PRIVILEGE TO REPRESENT THE FAMILIES THAT ARE SERVED BY THE CALIFORNIA CHILDREN'S HOSPITALS. AND I'M HERE ALSO IN HONOR OF MY SON MAX. MAX WAS BORN IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR WITH. CANNELLA HEART DISEASE CALLED TETRALOGY FOLLOW MEANS THAT FOR MAJOR THINGS WRONG WITH HIS HEART. HE HAD HIS FIRST SURGERY WHEN HE WAS THREE MONTHS OLD AND OUR JOURNEY AND SO FAR HE'S HAD THREE PULMONARY BOWS REPLACED FOR PACEMAKERS THIRTEEN SURGERIES AND ALL. MOST RECENTLY WHICH WAS THREE MONTHS AGO HE HAD OPEN HEART SURGERY TO REPLACE A PULMONARY VALVE. BUT BECAUSE OF THE GREAT CARE HE RECEIVED THAT'S NOT HAS TOTAL STORY. HE LOVES LEARNING HIM AS ACADEMIC SEASON ATHLETE HE'S AN ACTOR SOME OF YOU MAY KNOW HIM AS THE MANY DARTH VADER FROM A SUPERBOWL COMMERCIAL IF YEARS AGO. WHERE HE WAS A LITTLE GUY THAT WAS STARTING THE CAR? AND THAT ALSO LEAD TO A PLATFORMER HIS AN ADVOCATE THIS MORNING MAX WAS SPEAKING IN ORANGE COUNTY TWO HUNDRED EXECUTIVES ENCOURAGING THEM TO DONATE TO HEART VALVE RESEARCH. MAX IS LIVING PROOF OF PATIENTS THAT. WHOSE LIVES ARE SAVED AND THE QUALITY IMPROVES BECAUSE OF THE TECHNOLOGY ADVANCES THAT INDUSTRIES MAKING AND OUR OUR CENTERS WHERE RESEARCH IS DONE. THE INFRASTRUCTURE ENHANCEMENTS AND IMPROVE PATIENT CARE FOCUS ON A PATIENT CENTERED CARE WHERE FAMILIES ARE NOW INVOLVED. IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR AS MAX FOUGHT FOR HIS LIFE IN THE NICK YOU IN OUR LOCAL COMMUNITY. WE HAD MY IS AT AN I HAD VISITING HOURS AND AN OCCASIONAL CONSUL THE IF WE'RE LUCKY ENOUGH TO BE THERE AT THE SAME TIME AS THE DOCTOR. TODAY WE SLEEP IN A ROOM WITH SHOWER IN ROOM. FOOD IS BROUGHT TO US SO WE NEVER HAVE TO LEAVE MAX. ASKED US IN WHEN HE WAS TWELVE YEARS AND FOR A VERY LONG SAY AND AND MOST RECENTLY. PLEASE DON'T LEAVE ME ALONE FOR ONE SECONDS. AND THIS IS THE KID THAT IS OF AS A PRACTICE PATIENT HE KNOWS HOW TO BE PATIENT. AND HE THAT HE WANTS OUT AYE WITH THEM AT ALL TIMES BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENS IS A DOCTOR OR A NURSE WILL COME AND WERE NOT THERE AND THAT ALSO AND THINGS WILL BE SAID THINGS WILL BE SAID OVER HIS HEAD AS IF HE DOESN'T HERE. AND IT'S A CONFUSING SCARY TIME EVEN FOR SOMEONE AS CONFIDENT AS MAX. WE ALSO NOW PART OF THE DECISION WERE NOT FORCED OUT OF THE ROOM FOR ROUNDING WERE INCLUDED IN THE ROUNDING AT MAX'S INCLUDED ALSO. AND A LOT OF DECISIONS THAT ARE MADE. IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR OUR SURGEON TOLD US THAT AND HE HAD AN IDEA OF WHAT WE'RE GOING AFTER BASED ON THE DIAGNOSTIC TESTING AT THE TIME BUT THAT WHEN HE GOT INTO MAX'S HEART THERE MIGHT BE SOME SURPRISES AND PREPARES FOR THE SURPRISES. YOU CAN ONLY GIVE US. HIS ADVICE FROM THAT VANTAGE POINT. TODAY WE HAVE THREE D. ECHOCARDIOGRAM TO GIVE A MUCH CLEARER PICTURE OF WHAT'S ACTUALLY GOING ON AND WE HAVE THREE D. PRINTING OF INDIVIDUAL CHILDREN'S HEARTS SO NOW BEFORE HIS INTERVENTIONAL CARDIOLOGISTS OR HIS SURGEON CUTS INTO HIM. MACS THEY HAVE A REALLY CLEAR GAME PLAN AND NOW THEY'RE NOT WASTING TIME ON THE HEART LUNG BYPASS MACHINE THEY KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING BEFORE THEY GO WHEN THEY HAVE A. SAVE THEM SO MUCH TIME. IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR THE ONLY OPTION TO REPLACE A PULMONARY DOLLARS OPEN HEART SURGERY THAT WAS IT. TODAY WE HAVE. SOME PATIENTS QUALIFY FOR MILLION BASE OF SURGERY THAT CAN PUT IN A PULMONARY VALVE OR OTHER VALVES. AND THREE ARE GROWING POSSIBLY OUR NECK DEPENDING ON HOW HOW. BIG THE CHILD THIS. WE SAW THIS A MAX WAS TEN HE RECEIVED ABOUT THIS WAY. WHEN THAT MAX WAS SEVENTY HAD OPEN HEART SURGERY IT WAS A SIX MONTH RECOVERY IS VERY PAINFUL AND HE WAS SIDELINED FROM HIS WIFE. WHEN HE WAS TEN HE RECEIVED ONE OF THESE VALVES MEMBER INVASIVE ALSO WE LEFT THE NEXT DAY OF THE TYLENOL AND A BANDAID. SO IT'S IT'S TRANSFORMATIVE WHAT CAN HAPPEN THAT ONLY HAPPENS IF THE HOSPITALS CAN KEEP UP WITH THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO KEEP UP WITH TECHNOLOGY THAT INDUSTRIES PROVIDING. BUT I'LL TELL YOU IS SITTING THERE WATCHING HIM JUMP UP AND DOWN AND I WAS BEGGING HIM NOT TO EVEN THOUGH THE DOCTOR WAS TELLING HIM TO IT'S AS IF YOU'RE WATCHING A SCI FI MOVIE RIGHT THAT TRANSFORM RIGHT BEFORE YOUR EYES. THESE. PAST BONDS AND THIS PAST PROPOSITION SIXTY ONE AND THREE THEY HELPED CREATE TODAY WITHOUT THOSE I DON'T KNOW THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITALS ANGELUS WOULD HAVE BEEN AS PREPARED FOR MAX. THIS PROPOSITION WILL HELP CREATE TOMORROW AND TOMORROW IS VERY IMPORTANT OF THOSE CHILDREN LIKE MAX WHO LIVE WITH LIFELONG DISEASE MAX IS NEVER GOING TO BE CURED. HE'S ALWAYS BEEN NEED A PACEMAKER EVENTUALLY RUN OUT OF BATTERY JUICE HE'S GONNA BE NO VOWS BECAUSE ARTIFICIAL THOUGH WEAR OUT. AND SO WE ALWAYS HAVE ON OUR MIND WHAT THAT WHAT THE HORIZON IS. I'VE LIVED IN THESE CHILDREN'S HOSPITALS NOW RADIS TALK CHILDREN'S HOSP LOS ANGELES FOR THE LAST THIRTEEN YEARS. AND IN MY OPINION JUST AS A MOM AN OUTSIDE OBSERVER. THERE'S FOUR THINGS THAT MAKE THEM SUCCESSFUL ONE IS THE HOSPITAL'S ATTRACTING THE TOP TALENTS CALIFORNIA AND KEEPING IT IN CALIFORNIA. TWO IS OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES THAT WE SUPPORT WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO INSPIRE AND INFORM THEM OF WHY IT'S IMPORTANT TO TAKE CARE OF CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE WHO DON'T THINK THEY'LL EVER NEED IT. NONE OF US EVER THINK WE'LL NEED IT AND SO WE DO. THE PATIENT FAMILIES LIKE MINE WE HAVE. NOT JUST CONSUMER HEALTH CARE WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO CONTRIBUTE BACK TO IT. WHETHER IT'S SHARING OUR STORIES OUR TALENTS OUR TIME OUR TREASURE HOWEVER WHATEVER WE CAN DO TO HELP KEEP THEM OPEN FOR THOSE WHO COME BEHIND US. AND THE FOURTH ONE IS OUR GOVERNMENT AS YOU HEARD THE REIMBURSEMENTS OR HOSPITAL PRIMARILY COME FROM THE GOVERNMENT BY STATE AND LOCAL AND AND FEDERAL AND WE ARE SO GRATEFUL THAT YOU ALSO HAVE THAT THE GREATEST ABILITY TO MAKE AND CREATE TRANSFORMATIVE CHANGE TO THESE HOSPITALS. ON THIS WOULD BE REVOLUTIONARY FOR THESE HOSPITALS A HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS I'M ON THE BOARD AT CHL AND I KNOW HOW FAR THAT. THAT COULD GO FOREST'S. THIS IS THE PART THAT'S THE MOM PART IT'S A LITTLE DIFFICULT BUT I'VE SPENT MANY NIGHTS IN THE HOSPITAL WATCHING MY SON SLEEP. AND MY PRAYER WAS THAT HIS LIFE NO MATTER HOW LONG THROUGH TURN THEM OVER SO MANY TIMES THAT NINE COULD GET HIM BACK. WOULD MATTER THAT IT COULD BE THAT THE STORY COULD MEAN SOMETHING MORE. AND BE SERVED AS A HIGHER PURPOSE AND I APPRECIATE YOU LISTENING TODAY AND HAVING ME HERE BECAUSE THIS IS ONE OF THOSE MOMENTS. WHERE EVERYTHING HE ENDORSE ALL THE PAIN ALL THE FEAR? CAN MATTER TODAY BECAUSE HIS STORY COMMENDED VOICE AND BE AN EXAMPLE AS TO WHAT THESE CHILDREN FIGHT FOR. AND WHERE WE'VE COME INTO WHERE WE'RE GOING SO I THINK YOU FOR HELPING US REACH TODAY. BECAUSE MAX THE BENEFICIARY DIRECT BENEFICIARY OF THESE DOLLARS AND I THANK YOU FOR HELPING US CREATE TOMORROW. JUST A COMMENT I LIKE TO COMMEND MISS PAGE FOR YOUR TESTIMONY IS VERY COMPELLING.
