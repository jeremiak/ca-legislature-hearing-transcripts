AND GOOD AFTERNOON ASSEMBLY IT'S REALLY WONDERFUL TO BE HERE AND- WE'RE HERE TO SHARE WITH YOU ABOUT- SOME REALLY EXCITING THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING AND I'M IN CALIFORNIA WOULD YOU NOT JUSTICE AND A HUGE FOCUS THAT. HAS STARTED TO. GAIN MOMENTUM IN THE LAST FEW YEARS MOVING TOWARDS HIGHER EDUCATION I'M AND SPECIFICALLY WITH YOUNG PEOPLE AND THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM TO HAVE ACCESS TO HIGHER EDUCATION. I SO I'M K&lt;c.cyan&gt; BLESSED&lt;/c&gt; AND I'VE BEEN AT USE LAWCENTER FOR THE LAST COUPLE YEARS BUT PRIOR TO WORKING AT USE LAWCENTER. I WAS WORKING AT THE COLLEGE OF SAN MATTEO AND STARTED A PROGRAM CALLED PROJECT CHANGE- WHICH IS FOR YOUNG PEOPLE TO HAVE ACCESS TO HIGHER EDUCATION AND MAKE A TRANSITION- FROM BEING IN JUVENILE DETENTION FACILITIES TO COMING TO THE COLLEGE CAMPUS- AND MUCH OF THAT I ALSO JUST GREW OUT OF MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE HAVING BEEN INCARCERATED THE MAJORITY OF MY HIGH SCHOOL EXPERIENCE- AND GETTING MY HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA AND FIGHTING TO GET IT WHILE I WAS IN THESYSTEM- AND WHILE I WAS. IN JUVENILE HALL THIS IS IN THE NINETIES- THEY DIDN'T HAVE HIGHER EDUCATION PROGRAMS AND IT WAS VERY CLEAR TO ME- ONCE I MADE THE TRANSITION MYSELF- TO. OBTAINING A HIGHER EDUCATION FOR MYSELF AND- ENDING UP TEACHING AT THE COLLEGE OF SAN MATEO THAT I REALLY NEED TO MAKE THIS AVAILABLE FOR OTHER YOUNG PEOPLE SO THAT THEY WOULDN'T HAVE TO STRUGGLE. THROUGHTHE EXPERIENCES OF TRYING TO NAVIGATE THE HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM- AND WITH US TODAY OUR STUDENTS WHO HAVE GONE THROUGH THE EXPERIENCE OF THE JUSTICE SYSTEM AND GOING FORWARD- TO GETTING THEIR DEGREES AND I'M ALSO CURRENTLY IN THEON THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE TO OBTAIN THEIR DEGREE- SO WE HAVE A WHOLE- SWATH OF EXAMPLES- BUT IT'S BEEN REALLY POWERFUL TO WATCH WHAT HAPPENS- WHEN THIS CAN BECOME AVAILABLE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE I'M TO BE ABLE TO HAVE ACCESS TO PATHWAYS TO HIGHER EDUCATION- AND THEN TO. LASTLY THERE'S BEEN A HUGE NETWORK THAT'S GROWN I'M IN THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS FOR THIS FOCUS AMBER WE HAVE COLLEGES ALL ACROSS THE STATE WHO ARE TRYING TO DO THIS WORK- AND MAKE SURE THAT. HIGHER EDUCATION IS ACCESSIBLE AND FOR YOUNG PEOPLE AND SO- WE'RE AT A POINT NOW WHERE WITH THE CLOSURE OF DJJ AND THE REALIGNMENT BILL- WE HAVE A REALLY UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABLE TO GRAB HOLD- OF PROGRAMS SUCH AS THE ONE I SHARED WITH YOU BUT OF COURSE- THE OTHER PROGRAMS THAT ARE OUT IN OUR- IN OUR STATE THAT ARE DOING THIS WORK TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUNG PEOPLE ARE. NOT FIGHTING TO HAVE ACCESS TO OPPORTUNITIES. THANK YOU. HI MY NAME'S NICK A NECKLACE YEAH SO I'M THE- YOUTH VOICE POLICY COACH FOR FRESH I FUNDS FOR YOUTH. I'M ALSO A UCLA ALUM AND A CALL TO SUBMIT TO A PROJECT CHANGE ALONE- AND ACTUALLY I DID UC CENTER SACRAMENTO- AND I HAD I HAD SOME FRIENDS THAT WERE IN YOUR YOUR OFFICE AS A MEMBER SO AND THEN- ACTUALLY MY OLD INTERNSHIP COORDINATOR- WORKS FOR YOU NOW AS A MEMBER MUCH THAT. AND I WAS ACTUALLY IN YOUR YOUR OFFICE RECENTLY. I GIVE YOU THE A GROUP OF YOUTH THE TOUR- AND WE WENT THERE. L. IT THE GREAT- AS A AS A PERFORMING ARTS CITY STUDENT I WOULD HAVE GONE TO COLLEGE WITHOUT PROJECT CHANGE IT WASN'T SOMETHING THAT WAS WAS ON MY LIST OF PLANS- I WAS I WAS VERY MUCH ENTRENCHED IN THE SCHOOL TO PRISON PIPELINE- IN SCHOOL TO ME WAS THIS A PLACE WHERE I RECEIVED MORE PUNISHMENT IT WAS IT WAS A PUNITIVE SYSTEM- I ACTUALLY GOT INCARCERATED ON A SCHOOL CAMPUS- FROM BEING POLICED IN MY COMMUNITY AND BEING POLICE IN MY SCHOOL THAT ALL STARTED WITH A GETTING DETENTIONS AND SUSPENSIONS OR WHATEVER FOR. BEHAVIOR OR- GETTING TO FIGHTS LIKE THINGS THAT LITTLE BOYS DO RIGHT- WHICH LED ME TO BEING INCARCERATED WHEN I WAS FOURTEEN YEARS OLD I WAS LIKE FIVE FOOT TWO AND A HUNDRED TWENTY POUNDS- I THINK- NO CHILD SHOULD GO GO TO JAIL LIKE THAT- AND IT WASN'T UNTIL I CAME INTO. CONTACT THE PROJECT CHANGE THAT I BELIEVE THAT COLLEGE WAS AN OPTION FOR ME- AND ONCE I GOT THERE I. I STARTED THE STUDENT CLUBS I WAS THE PRESIDENT OF THAT FOR ABOUT TWO YEARS- AND THEN MY LAST YEAR KATIE ACTUALLY HIRED ME TO BE A PROGRAM AMBASSADOR. I GET PAID TO DO THE WORK THAT I WAS DOING- ALLOWED ME TO TRANSFER TO UCLA. I GOT SUPER INVOLVED IN STATEWIDE- FORMING CURSORY LEADERSHIP- AND IT REALLY CHANGED THE TRAJECTORY OF MY LIFE- AND SO NOW PART OF WHAT I DO IS I BRING YOUNG PEOPLE TO THE CAPITAL- SHOW THEM HOW EVERYTHING WORKS- TEACH YOU ABOUT THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS AND THINGS LIKE THAT- AND HELP THEM BE ADVOCATES FOR. FOR THEIR OWN FUTURE I IN AND GIVE THEM THOSE TOOLS- AND THIS REALLY WOULD HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE WITHOUT PROJECT CHANGE- IN GOING FORWARD I'M- I HATE TO SAY ABOUT ME GO BACK TO GRAD SCHOOL- IN A PROBABLY GET INTO YOU KNOW TEACHING IN GET INTO HIGHER ED- AND DO MORE OF THIS WE'RE GOING FORWARD AND ALWAYS STAY IN THE IN THE- JUVENILE JUSTICE FROM- THANK YOU FOR. FOR LETTING US COME IN AND SHARE STORIES AND BE HERE WITH YOU TODAY AND I'LL GO AHEAD AND PASS IT ACTUALLY. HI GUYS IT'S A PLEASURE MY NAME IS ASHLEY HARRIS- I JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU GUYS SO MUCH FOR HAVING US HERE IT'S A BIG BLESSING OR ME- BUT YEAH COMING IN FOURTH IN KIND OF GOING BACK ON TO WHAT NICK HAS SAID. I'VE ALSO BEEN- IN THE INCARCERATED SYSTEM TO GROWING UP- I HAVEN'T HAD MY PARENTS GROWING UP SO IT'S BEEN A LITTLE BIT DIFFICULT HAVING LIKE A SUPPORT SYSTEM AND YOU KNOW PEOPLE YOU CAN LIKE RELY ON- AND SO. COMING OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL WHICH I DIDN'T THINK I WAS EVER GOING TO GRADUATE WHICH I DID I WAS ABLE TO GRADUATE ON STAGE- FOR AMERICAN HIGH SCHOOL- AND COMING OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL AND NOT KNOWING LIKE WHERE TO GO WHERE TURN TO EVEN IF I HAVE. OPTIONS AVAILABLE FOR ME JUST BECAUSE- WHEN YOU GET IN TROUBLE YOU. THINK YOU THERE'S NOTHING ELSE LEFT OUT THERE FOR YOU FUTURE WHY IS- YOU KNOW PERSONALITY WISE AND- PROJECT CHANGE WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS ABLE TO LIKE OPEN MY EYES AND SEE THAT PEOPLE MAKE MISTAKES AND THERE'S- YOU KNOW NOTHING WRONG WITH. STILL ACHIEVING AND STILL ATTEMPTING YOUR CALLS BECAUSE THE WORST THAT CAN HAPPEN IF SOMEBODY COULD JUST TELL YOU KNOW- SO YEAH THIS PROGRAM IS JUST DEFINITELY BEEN LIKE A BIG EYE OPENER AND YOU KNOW. BIG BLESSING FOR MY LIFE- AS I GET TO MEET NEW PEOPLE AND- YOU KNOW SHARE MY STORIES AND HELP PEOPLE AND YOU KNOW HOW THAT SUPPORT SYSTEM THERE YOU KNOW IF THAT MAKES SENSE. AND SO IT'S JUST BEEN A BLESSING TO HAVE KATIE AND NICK AND- EVERYBODY BECAUSE LIKE WITHOUT THEM I. DON'T KNOW WHY BUT- YEAH IT'S A IT'S A GREAT PROGRAM AND I JUST I DON'T KNOW WHERE.

WE ALSO HAVE ON A WEBEX JACKIE RODRIGUEZ. WHO IT WILL BE SPEAKING NEXT CAN WE- HOWEVER COME THROUGH. CHECK YOUR YOU THEIR- I'M HERE AND MY VIDEO IS ON TO I'M NOT SURE IF YOU'RE ABLE TO SEE ME. REGAL YES- EIGHT. PLEASURE TO BE HERE I'M SORRY I COULDN'T BE THERE N PERSON BUT IT'S ALWAYS A PLEASURE TO BE ABLE. TO BE HERE THE PROJECT CHANGE- MY NAME IS JACQUELINE RODRIGUEZ I AM CURRENTLY. SENIOR GRADUATING IN JUNE FROM UCLA. I AM A PARENTING STUDENTS AT I AM ALSO A- JUST TELL PROJECT CHANGE ALUMNI. SO IT'S DEFINITELY A PLEASURE TO BE HERE AND ALWAYS TO ADVOCATE- FOR PROJECT CHANGE BECAUSE- CHANGE IS THE REASON THAT I AM WHERE I AM TODAY. I CAME FROM A VERY NONTRADITIONAL BACKGROUND I ENTERED THAT ARE JUST AS SOMEONE I WAS TWELVE YEARS OLD WHEN. I WAS INCARCERATED IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT BECAUSE I WAS THE YOUNGEST ONE IN CLASS- OBVIOUSLY I WAS IN SEVENTH GRADE ALL THE GIRLS WERE FRESHMAN SOPHOMORE JUNIORS SO YOU PATIENT WAS VERY DIFFICULT AND THERE I WOULD GET YOU KNOW. RENDON STUDIES WORK TO DO IN THE BACK ALL THE I NEVER HAD ACCESS TO REALLY GOOD EDUCATION FOR ME. BUT WHEN I GOT LEASE- I ANSWER A- CONTINUATION SCHOOL EVEN THOUGH I HAD ALL THE CREDIT TO GO TO A REGULAR HIGH SCHOOL. I WENT TO CONTINUATION SCHOOL. LAW WAS THERE I WAS ABLE TO DO CONCURRENT ENROLLMENT WHICH WAS REALLY GREAT BECAUSE COMING FROM THE BACKGROUND LIKE ME AND GOING INTO A COLLEGE UP FIFTEEN YEARS OLD SOMETHING I NEVER THOUGHT I WAS ABLE TO DO. WAS SUCH AN EYE OPENER FOR ME BECAUSE- YOU TO KNOW THAT I. WAS ABLE TO ENTER THIS SPACE AS WELL- I JUST DON'T HAVE THAT MANY RESOURCES AT THE TIME AND I ENDED UP GETTING PREGNANT WHEN I WAS SIXTEEN. SO I PRETTY MUCH DROPPED OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL I DIDN'T HAVE. THE RESOURCES AND- AFTER MY SECOND CHILD I KNEW THAT IN ORDER TO NOT GO TO THE SCHOOL TO PRISON PIPELINE IN ORDER TO BETTER MY- FUTURE. WELL HOW TO PURSUE HIGHER EDUCATION. SO WHEN I ENTERED COLLEGE WAS ON THE TAIL I ACTUALLY MET A STUDENT WHO I USED TO BE INCARCERATED WITH. AND HE TOLD ME ALL ABOUT TO CHANGE. AND AS SOON AS I GOT INVOLVED WITH PROJECT CHANGE IT COMPLETELY CHANGED MY LIFE FOR THE BETTER. I HAD SO MUCH COMMUNITIES SO MANY PEOPLE SUPPORTING ME SO MANY PEOPLE ARE JUST LIKE ME WHERE AND WE THOUGHT WE WERE NEVER EVEN GOOD ENOUGH TO ENTER THE SPACE IT. THANK YOU TAKE THE PROJECT CHANGE I WAS ABLE TO DO SO MUCH ADVOCACY I ACTUALLY TESTIFIED FOR SB SEVEN ONE SIX. I WAS ABLE TO GO TO CONFERENCES FOR FORMERLY INCARCERATED STUDENTS ACROSS THE COUNTRY- I WAS ABLE TO TRANSFER TO UCLA WHICH SOMETHING I NEVER THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO. AND I CAN TRULY SAY THAT I WOULD NOT BE HERE. IF IT WASN'T FOR PROJECT CHANGE. NOW I. GRADUATING FROM YOU SEE. I AM ACTUALLY TAKING OUTSIDE THIS YEAR. AND APPLYING TO LAW SCHOOL I'M HOPE TO. GET INVOLVED WITH- GET. KEEP GETTING A OUR WOULD YOU WANNA JUST IS HOPEFULLY GET INVOLVED. ALMOST BECOMING AN ATTORNEY FOR DOING ALSO SO. EXCITED TO BE HERE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING US AND LIKE I SAID IF IT WASN'T FOR PROJECT CHANGE I WOULD NOT BE WHERE I AM TODAY SO THANK. I THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT OUT WE DO HAVE- I HAVE QUESTIONS AND I'M AM SURE MY COLLEAGUES TAT QUESTION BUT BEFORE WE WENT INTO THIS QUESTIONS IF I COULD GO BACK TO MISS BLISS CAN YOU. TALK TO A LITTLE BIT ABOUT- HOW THE PROGRAM WORKS A LITTLE MORE DETAILS AND SURE- SO THE STRUCTURE OF THE PROGRAM IT'S- BASED IN A COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND THAT'S A THAT'S A VERY PURPOSEFUL AS WELL BECAUSE MANY YOUNG PEOPLE- WHO WERE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM IMPACTED- HAVE A DISJOINTED EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCE OR- YOU KNOW IN AND OUT OF FACILITIES- IN AND OUT OF SCHOOL. YOU KNOW VARIOUS SCHOOLS- AND SO GOING RIGHT INTO A UC OR CSU OR PRIVATE UNIVERSITY RIGHT AFTER COLLEGE I'M SOMETIMES IS VERY CHALLENGING- AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES HAVE YOU KNOW A WEALTH OF BENEFITS AS MANY OF US NOW- BUT SO THE STRUCTURE OF THE PROGRAM IS THAT. THERE IS BOTH AN ON CAMPUS COMPONENTS- WHERE THERE'S A HUGE A SUPPORT SYSTEM ON THE CAMPUS AND THEN THERE'S ALSO- SUPPORT WITHIN DETENTION FACILITIES AND ALTERNATIVE AND CORDON COMMUNITY SCHOOLS SO WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE- PROFESSORS GO INTO THE JUVENILE HALL- AND TEACH CLASSES AND THIS IS ALSO AT THIS POINT SINCE COBIT HYBRID WHERE THERE'S- ONLINE COURSES THAT ARE MADE AVAILABLE AND STUDENTS ARE RECEIVING UC CSU TRANSFERABLE COURSES WHICH IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT- FOR TO BE CREDIT BEARING- IT'S ALSO DUAL ENROLLMENT- COURSES WHICH IS A HUGE- PIECE OF THE PROGRAM IS. THAT YOU THINK PEOPLE ARE STARTING THEIR EDUCATIONAL JOURNEY AT A YOUNG AGE- AND AS I MENTIONED EARLIER WITH THE- ASPECT OF YOUNG PEOPLE BEING- CREDIT DEFICIENT- AS PART OF. WHAT HAPPENS- THIS IS ALSO INSTEAD OF POSITIVE SHIFT- TOWARDS HAVING THEIR CREDITS BE AT COLLEGE AND HIGH SCHOOL AT THE SAME TIME VERSUS WHAT I THINK IS TRADITIONALLY BEEN DONE WHERE IT'S INDEPENDENT STUDY. OR ADULT SCHOOL I'M SAID THIS SHIFT SENT TO- HAVING AGAIN ALL OF THAT COMPONENTS THAT COME WITH BEING PART OF- A COLLEGE ATMOSPHERE WHERE IT'S POSITIVE- IDENTITY AND IT'S ALSO A MESSAGE TO YOUNG PEOPLE TO THAT. YOU KNOW YOU HAVE ALL THESE PATHS ARE AVAILABLE TO YOU AND ALSO WE BELIEVE IN YOUR EDUCATION AND WE DON'T ALSO WANT TO LIMITS- BUT WHAT MADE OF A- TO YOU- SO% THAT'S THE INSIDE COMPONENTS- AND THEN THE ON CAMPUS COMPONENT WHICH I THINK IS. A HUGE- PART OF THE FOCUS AND AGAIN WITH THE DJJ CLOSURE AND EVERYTHING THAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW IN CALIFORNIA I THINK THIS IS ANOTHER HUGE PIECE WHICH IS THAT- YOUNG PEOPLE ARE ON THE CAMPUS TAKING COURSES JUST AS ANY COLLEGE STUDENT WOULD DO BUT THEY HAVE. A NETWORK- AND NECK MENTIONED I'M A LITTLE BIT THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT NECK ACTUALLY BUILT- VERY MUCH WHICH IS WHERE YOUNG PEOPLE ARE PART OF H. COMMUNITY BASED LEARNING- THEY HAVE- STUDENT LEADERSHIP AND BATTED AND A WHOLE. NETWORK OF PEOPLE ON THE CAMPUS THAT ARE DEEPLY DEDICATED TO THE STUDENTS SUCCESS ALL THE WAY FROM YOU KNOW THE CHANCELLOR TO THE PRESIDENT TO FACULTY AND THAT'S A BIG PART OF. THE PROGRAM STRUCTURES THAT YOU WANT BY AND FROM THE ENTIRE CAMPUS COMMUNITY SAID THAT- EVERYBODY IS SUPPORTED AND ALSO DEMYSTIFIES FOR PEOPLE TO- WHO THESE YOUNG PEOPLE ARE- SINCE UNFORTUNATELY THAT CONTINUES TO BE A STIGMA- SO THAT'S A LITTLE BIT OF THE STRUCTURE OF THE PROGRAM. AND HOW MANY COMMUNITY COLLEGES CURRENTLY HAVE A MODEL SIMILAR TO PROJECT CHANGE. THERE IT IS BEEN THE DIRECT PROGRAM HAS BEEN REPLICATED ACROSS THREE COLLEGE THE RISING SCHOLARS NETWORK ACROSS THE STATE- THERE ARE. TWENTY SIX COLLEGES THAT HAVE STARTED TO FOCUS ON JUVENILE JUSTICE IN PARTICULAR- AND SO IF YOUR- NOT AWARE AT THE RISING SCHOLARS NETWORK- HAS REALLY FOCUSED ON THE ADULT POPULATION- JAILS PRISONS- BUT HAS DONE WORK WITH YOUTH AND IN THE LAST COUPLE YEARS HAS REALLY TURNED THEIR ATTENTION- IN COLLABORATION WITH OUR YOU KNOW. FOLKS SITTING HERE AND OUT IN THE COMMUNITY TO MAKE SURE THAT JUVENILE JUSTICE IS ANOTHER- AREA THAT THERE'S ATTENTION TO. AND FOR BEFORE THE STUDENTS ARE FOR THE STUDENTS WHO ARE EXITING THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SOME WHO ARE STILL NOT DONE WITH. HIGH SCHOOL IS THERE SOMETHING. IS THERE SOMETHING FOR THEM AS WELL OR DO YOU IS IT JUST FOR THEM WHEN THEY'RE AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE. SO THE CALL SORRY COULD YOU REPEAT IF I'M IF I'M- IF ON THE SIXTEEN YEAR OLD AND I'M STILL IN HIGH SCHOOL AND I'M I'M EXITING. THE JUVENILE DETENTION- WHAT'S AVAILABLE FOR THEM AND HOW TO THE HOW TO TAP INTO PROGRAMS LIKE THIS YES SO THAT'S THE DUAL ENROLLMENT PIECE- WHERE YOUNG PEOPLE ARE TAKING COLLEGE CLASSES REGARDLESS OF DIPLOMA OR EVEN FIFTEEN SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD AND SO THEY CAN IN FACT AND DUE. IN ROLL ON THE COLLEGE CAMPUS TAKE COURSES- OR IF THEY GO BACK TO THEIR HIGH SCHOOL- IN THERE. AND TAKING THEIR HIGH SCHOOL COURSES AND THEY CAN ALSO STILL BE ENGAGED IN ACTIVITIES THAT. ARE GOING ON WITH THE PROGRAM OR CAN ALSO BE TAKING COLLEGE CLASSES WHILE THEY'RE FINISHING THEIR HIGH SCHOOL COURSES SO THERE'S THAT- THERE'S ALSO A LOT OF WRAPAROUND SUPPORT SERVICES- THAT ARE MADE AVAILABLE WITH BASIC NEEDS- CHILD CARE TRANSPORTATION FOOD- ACCESS TO HOUSING SO. THIS IS AVAILABLE TO STUDENTS WHETHER THEY HAVE THEIR DIPLOMA OR DO NOT. SOMEWHERE THE DORLAND FEDERAL MEMBER PROGRAMS- THANK IS. AND THEN I WANT TO ASK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THE NETWORK THAT'S BEEN CREATED AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE FOR THE FIRST TWO MONTHS AND THEN PART IN THAT IMPORTANT PIECE IS THERE A NETWORK LIKE THAT THAT THE STUDENTS GET WHEN THEY GO BACK TO HIGH SCHOOL OR- SO THE STUDENTS CAN STILL- YOU KNOW COME TO CAMPUS AND BEING GAUGE RAFTS- THE NETWORK. REALLY THE STUDENT CLUB- THAT'S BEEN CREATED THAT'S THE SOCIAL PEACE- BUT ALSO AGAIN HAVING ACCESS TO ALL THE COURSES AND BASIC NEEDS SUPPORTS BUT THE SOCIAL ASPECT OF BEING ABLE TO MEET REGULARLY THERE'S A- FOR A LONG TIME THERE'S BEEN A ONCE A WEEK- MEETING FOR STUDENTS TO BE ABLE TO MEET ON CAMPUS- AND DURING COPE AND VIRTUALLY SO THAT'S THE SUPPORT SYSTEM- AND THERE. IT THE GOAL IS ALSO TO HAVE IT BE A MULTIPLE ENTRY POINTS SO THAT'S NOT LEAVING ANY YOUNG PERSON OUT. IF THAT HELPS AND THEN FOR- IS MY LAN I'M MORE QUESTIONS BUT AFTER THIS ON HAND THAT OFF TO THE COMMISSION I WAS A CLASSROOM TEACHER FOR THIRTEEN YEARS THAT'S WHAT- FOR ASHLEY- JACQUELINE AND NICK- ETHNIC SPECIFICALLY YOU TALKED ABOUT HOW. YOU SOLVE SCHOOL IS A PLACE OF PUNISHMENT AND- THIS IS A PROJECT CHANGE HELP YOU CHANGE. CHANGE THAT HOW. WHAT WAS THAT THE ATTRACTED YOU I MEAN HOW YOU KNOW WE HAVE LOTS OF PROJECTS OUT THERE PROGRAMS OUT THERE FOR INDIVIDUALS RIGHT AND THEN THERE'S THAT. YOU YOU DECIDE AND STICK IT ON EACH OF IT AND SO I'M EXCITED THAT WE HAVE THESE EXAMPLES WITH THE THREE OF YOU WHAT WAS SPECIAL ABOUT THIS PROGRAM TO CONVINCE YOU TO TAKE ADVANTAGE. OF IT. YEAH SO I THINK FIRST OF ALL ESPECIALLY LIKE I USED TO FOR ME AND I THINK IT'S TRUE FOR THIS POPULATION IN GENERAL I THINK YOU KNOW K. THROUGH TWELVE YOU REALLY JUST IN SURVIVAL MODE YOU DON'T REALLY HAVE THE MOST CONTROL OVER YOUR ENVIRONMENT- OVER LIKE WHAT'S HAPPENING IN YOUR LIFE AS AN ADULT YOU GAIN A LITTLE BIT MORE- WHAT IS IT WHAT WHAT SORT FOR THAT- YOU EVEN AGENCY GET GET MORE AGENCY RIGHT- AND SO I THINK WHEN I WAS APPROACHED BY IT BY PROJECT CHANGE AND THEY'RE LIKE OH LIKE YOU CAN GO TO SCHOOL FOR FREE. AS A- FOR FREE WITH THE CIRCUS OUTBREAKS I HAD THIS CONCEPTION I I'D I KNEW NOTHING ABOUT COLLEGE COMMUNITY COLLEGE STATE SCHOOL UC'S ANYTHING- AND SO IN MY HEAD- COLLEGES SOMETHING YOU DID IF YOU WERE RICH RIGHT- EVEN AT THE COMMUNITY LEVEL IS LIKE THAT'S PROBABLY TOO MUCH FOR ME YOU KNOW RIGHT- AND SO HAVING THAT COMPONENT WHERE- IT WAS FREE THAT WAS THAT WAS HUGE AND THEN ALSO HAVING LIKE MENTOR SHIP- HAVING LIKE- THE PEOPLE TO ROUTE TO RELY ON ON CAMPUS AS WELL- A BIG THING FOR ME WHAT WAS IT WHERE ALL THE WARM HAND OFF SO WE CAME ON TO CAMPUS AND- COUNTRY DUE TO EVERYBODY FROM FINANCIAL AID TO GUIDANCE COUNSELORS TO PROFESSORS- I WAS- GIVEN A MENTOR. ON CAMPUS AS WELL WHO IS A PROFESSOR OF FILM PROFESSOR- AND SO THOSE THOSE ARE KEY COMPONENTS- REALLY CHANGED FOR ME AND THEN ONCE WE GOT THE STUDENT CLUB GOING IN- AND HAD EVERYBODY INVOLVED AND STUFF THAT WAS THAT WAS GREAT BECAUSE AND I BUILT IT I CAMPUS COMMUNITY COULD SOMETHING THAT ALSO HAPPENS- SPECIFICALLY THIS POPULATION WHEN PEOPLE START GETTING THEIR LIVES TOGETHER RIGHT- YOU HAVE TO CUT OFF PEOPLE AND YOU HAVE TO IT GETS A LITTLE LONELY- SERVER REBUILDING LIKE- POSITIVE- SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT- IS REALLY KEY AND THEN SO THEN. YOU KNOW WE'RE GOING BOWLING AND HIKING AND. ALL THAT SO IS IT WAS COOL. YEAH SO I CAN I CAN OF ELABORATE. THAT SAME. WAY NICK IT'S YOU KNOW. YOU'RE NOT YOU'RE KIND OF CONFUSED WHEN HE WANTS TO COME OUT OF OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL IT'S KIND OF. LIKE YOU KNOW LIKE. WHAT WHAT DO YOU DO IN A WAY- AND SO. FOR ME IT'S ALSO. KIND OF THE SAME THING I AND- YOU KNOW. HAVING CAME FROM YOU KNOW pOF PUTS IN YOUR MIND WILL YOU KNOW. IF YOU DON'T HAVE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF MONEY YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T GET THAT CERTAIN MANAGE EDUCATION YOU KNOW THAT YOU NEED- TOO YOU KNOW. PURSUED YOU KNOW WHATEVER DEGREE OR YOU KNOW PATH YOU CHOOSE TO TAKE- BUT IT'S- FOR ME IT'S NOT JUST. SO MUCH OF. THEM HELPING ME LIKE FINANCIALLY WITH LIKE MY SCHOOL IT'S MORE OF LIKE THE SUPPORT AND HAVING THESE. THE SAME PEOPLE GOING THROUGH THE EXACT SAME THING. YOU KNOW THAT I'M GOING THROUGH AND IT'S YOU KNOW IT'S SOMETHING THAT I LIKE TO BUILD WITH PEOPLE. AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THIS THIS PROGRAM IS THIS IT'S- YOU KNOW THEY- WE CAN BUILD YOU KNOW FROM. THE BOTTOM UP AND- THEY NEVER GIVE UP AND THAT'S JUST ONE THING THAT YOU KNOW STANDS OUT TO ME TOO. AS KATIE NEVER GIVES UP ON US SHE- WILL FIGHT. TILL THE END FOR US. OKAY ONE MORE THING SEE HOW. AT THINK THAT THAT'S ALL REALLY IMPORTANT PART OF THE PROGRAM MODEL IS IT IT'S NON PUNITIVE SO. THERE THERE ARE OTHER PROGRAMS FOR STUDENTS AT COMMUNICABLE JUST LIKE YOUR P. OR UPS RIGHT. BUT YOU HAVE TO MEET CERTAIN CRITERIA IS YOU HAVE TO TAKE A CERTAIN AMOUNT UNITS YOU NEED LIKE A CERTAIN GPA- AND THAT AND I THINK THAT THAT DETERS A LOT OF THIS POPULATION- BECAUSE F YOU CAN POTENTIALLY HAVE. THESE THESE PRIVILEGES REVOKED SOME PEOPLE JUST DON'T WANT TO TOUCH IT BECAUSE THEY'VE ALREADY HAD SO MANY NEGATIVE EXPERIENCES WITH WITH PROGRAMS RIGHT. WHERE THEY THEY'RE LIKE OH WE GOT YOU AND THEN THEY THEY ABANDONED YOU- SO THIS THIS THAT PART OF THE PROGRAM MODEL IS A KEY- PROBABLY. THE BIGGEST. YES THAT'S- I NEXT THING YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT. SOMETHING I DEFINITELY WANTED TO TOUCH UPON. SO SOMETHING THAT REALLY DREW ME. PROJECT CHANGE WAS. ABSOLUTELY THE COMMUNITY BECAUSE FOR ME. IT WAS DIFFICULT ENOUGH I MEAN I WANT TO SAY LIKE I MENTIONED I GOT INCARCERATED WHEN I WAS TWELVE I WAS IN SEVENTH GRADE. WHEN I. LEAST I PRETTY MUCH GOT OFF PROBATION AND I GOT PREGNANT RIGHT AWAY SO I DROPPED OUT. AND I DIDN'T BOTHER TO GO BACK TO HIGH SCHOOL OR TO GET MY GED. YOU TO GO STRAIGHT TO COLLEGE AND START MY CAREER AND I WANT TO DO EVERYTHING MY POWER TO DO SO. BUT I DIDN'T HAVE THE RESOURCES I'M A FIRST GENERATION COLLEGE STUDENTS SO I COULDN'T CALL MY PARENTS I MEAN. I COULD CALL AND SAY HEY WHAT DO I DO HOW DO I SIGN UP. APPLYING TO COLLEGES ON THE TAIL AND EVEN THOUGH IT'S COMING COLLEGE I WAS NERVOUS THAT WASN'T EVEN GOING TO GET ACCEPTED. ONE COMMUNITY COLLEGE IN THE FIRST PERSON I SEE IN MY FIRST CLASS IS A PERSON I WAS INCARCERATED WITH AND- I CAN PRODUCE TO THE COMMUNITY A PROJECT CHANGE AND EVERYTHING THEY HAVE TO OFFER- YOU KNOW KATIE NEVER GIVING UP ON US MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR YOU TO FAIL LIKE. ANYTHING I NEEDED KATIE WAS THERE FROM THE BEGINNING ALL OF MY PROJECT CHANGE COMMUNITY WAS THERE- YOU KNOW JUST SEEING EVERYONE DOING SO GREAT DOING SO MUCH ADVOCATE SEE. US GETTING BACK TO THE JUVENILE HALLS WE WERE INCARCERATED IN AND SPEAKING TO THE YOUTH AND NOW WHAT PROJECT CHANGE. WITH YOUR FOR ME. AND YOU KNOW SOMEONE COULD TRANSFER OVER TO UCLA I REMEMBER TEXTING LIKE OH MY GOODNESS IT'S MY TURN TO APPLY AND- YOU KNOW HE WAS ALWAYS THERE ALSO JUST YOU KNOW THE COMMUNITY JUST CONTINUED AND CONTINUED. ACTOR AND- THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WAS HUGE FOR ME BECAUSE I. DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHERE TO START. ALL SEVEN GREAT TO STRAIGHT TALK. I WAS WONDER. FROM THE EDUCATION ADVERSITY ENJOY HALL. AND BUILDING COMMUNITY AND HAVING THE RESOURCES HAVING SOMEONE FROM EVERY SINGLE DEPARTMENTS ON FINANCIAL AID COUNSELING YOU NAME IT- THEY'RE ALWAYS THERE FOR US HAVING COAL PORTS IN CLASSROOMS I WAS ALWAYS GREAT. AND I JUST SEEING EVERYBODY SO GREAT THAT WERE ONCE WE WERE ONCE IN A SITUATION HERE WE NEVER THOUGHT THIS WAS POSSIBLE. AND SEEN PEOPLE IN PROJECT CHANGE SEEN THEM TRANSFER OVER TO YOU SEE CSU. IT JUST MADE ME FEEL LIKE I COULD BE THAT PERSON TO DO IT TOO AND- NOW HERE I AM THAT PERSON DOING IT SO. I'M BEYOND GRATEFUL FOR EVERYTHING THAT PARTY CHANGES ON FOR ME. THIS DOES SOUND REALLY GOOD AND ENCOURAGING AND I'M I'M KIND OF CURIOUS BECAUSE AT AT SOME POINT THE LIGHT BULB HIT. FOR THE THREE OF YOU KNOW OR QUALITY OF WORK HERE- EVEN THOUGH YOU YOU. WANNA BERRIES MAY HAVE BEEN FINANCIAL YOU STILL GOT TO DO THE WORK. STILL RASHTRAPATI CLASS YOU STILL GOTTA TURN YOUR HOMEWORK YOU STILL GOTTA TRY TO KEEP UP WITH THE CLASS. AND IT SOUNDS LIKE. YOU HAD A COMMUNITY. OF FOLK. A WRAPAROUND SERVICES IS LIKE WE LIKE TO CALL IT- THAT WAS EITHER CREATED OR EMBEDDED. BUT IT. I KNOW YOU TALK ABOUT. THE FINANCIAL PART BUT WHAT REALLY WAS THE LIGHT. THAT MADE YOU SAY. I'M GONNA FINISH THIS THIS IS THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT. NO MATTER WHAT BECAUSE WHAT I HEAR IN YOUR VOICE AT SOME POINT. YOU'RE GOING TO DO THIS NO MATTER WHAT AND- AND THEN MY SECOND THING IS YOU KNOW. SO YOU DON'T MAKE A SECOND MISTAKE USC ALSO HAS PROGRAMS IN PLACE. EVEN APPLY TO ALSO- BUT BUT BUT SERIOUSLY IT IS. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THAT WE STRUGGLE ON PUBLIC SAFETY IS WHAT IS IT. THAT THAT WILL GET YOU ON THE RIGHT ROAD AND PATH AND WE EVEN HEARD YOU SAY. YOU DELIBERATELY SET I AM NOW WITH ANOTHER GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO SHARE THE SAME VALUES AND GOALS AND OBJECTIVES. N. AND YOU HAVE TO BALANCE A PUSH THEM AWAY BUT YOU HAD TO CONDUCT. GET THEM OUT OF YOUR LIFE AND HAVE NEW ACQUAINTANCES FRIENDS AND MENTORS AND- AS OPPOSED TO WHAT WAS HAPPENING BEFORE. BUT THERE'S GOT. TO BE AN ENGINE- I GREW UP WHERE I KNEW I WAS GOING TO GO TO COLLEGE EVERYBODY THAT WAS AROUND THE GOING TO GO TO COLLEGE WHEN AFFECTED WASN'T A QUESTION WHEN I WAS GOING TO GO TO COLLEGE. IS WHEN I WAS GOING TO GO TO HARVARD YALE USC OR LSU AND UCLA I KNEW I WAS GOING TO GO THE COMPETITION WAS WHICH COLLEGE YOU'RE GOING TO GO TO WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL. BUT I WAS AROUND THAT SAME GROUP OF FRIENDS THAT HAD THE SAME. NINE TAINTED THAT FELT THE SAME WAY AND SO HOW HOW CAN YOU GO FROM. ONE KIND OF SET OF FRIENDS SITUATIONS AND THEN ALL OF A pTURNED ON TO SAID. THIS IS THE WAY TO GO. FOR ME- WE ALL COME INTO THIS WORLD BY OURSELVES WE'RE ALL KIND OF LEAVE OUT OF THIS WORLD BY OURSELVES I FEEL LIKE FOR ME IT'S WHAT DRIVES YOU TO MAKE YOU SUCCESSFUL WHAT'S GOING TO BE BENEFICIAL FOR YOU NOT NOT YOUR FRIENDS THE YOU KNOW AT THE END OF THE DAY THEY CAN STICK WITH YOU AND CHEER YOU ON AND YOU KNOW WILL BE WITH YOU AND GET TO WHERE YOU YOU KNOW YOU WANT TO BE IN LIFE AS WELL AS HELPING OTHERS- BUT THEN YOU. ALSO SIT BACK AND YOU KNOW STAY BACK WITH THEM IF THAT MAKES SENSE AND DO NOTHING AND- I JUST BELIEVE IT ALL DEPENDS ON HOW SELF DRIVEN YOU ARE AND HOW MUCH SELF CONTROL YOU KNOW YOU HAVE- SO YEAH THAT WOULD ALWAYS IN YOU. IT JUST READ OUT OF YOU IT JUST IT TOOK A LITTLE BIT MORE. FOR IT TO COME OUT TO ACTUALLY SEE YOU KNOW OKAY I CAN ACTUALLY THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I CAN ACTUALLY DO IT'S NOT JUST SOMETHING THAT'S MADE UP IN MY MIND OR- YOU KNOW SO- FOR ME I DON'T FEEL LIKE I'M FROM ALL THAT CREATIVE A PERSON RIGHT- BUT I DO LIKE A PICK UP MENTORS AND ROLE MODELS ON THE WAY AND SO I THINK SEEN SEEN KATIE WHO HAD HAD BEEN TO THE SYSTEM AS WELL AND WAS NOW LEADING THIS PROGRAM- I REALLY LOOKED UP TO HER AND THEN- THROUGH THAT NETWORK I MET PEOPLE LIKE ANY REAL WHO. WHO STARTED UNDERGROUND SCHOLARS- IN SAW YOU KNOW PEOPLE WHO WERE DOING AT AT MULTIPLE LEVELS- IF IT REALLY WAS THAT COMMUNITY ACCOUNTABILITY ASPECT IN SEEING ALL THE ACCESS TO HIGHER EDUCATION PROVIDED- MY SECOND SEMESTER IN- IN COMMUNITY COLLEGE I STUDIED ABROAD FOR FREE- AND WENT TO FLORENCE AND LEFT THE COUNTRY FOR THE FIRST TIME- AND THAT WAS THAT WAS LIFE CHANGING FOR ME. AND I DON'T THINK I WOULD HAVE DONE THAT- IN IN ANY OTHER WAY THAN- HAVING ACCESS TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND THOSE LIKE SCHOLARSHIP FUNDS THAT THEY PROVIDED YOU KNOW- I DO KNOW COMMUNITY COLLEGES DID THAT. I DIDN'T KNOW EITHER- BUT A V. AS- IN. UPCOMING IT'S ACTUALLY GONNA BE IN LONDON THIS FALL REALLY YEAH. THAT'S GREAT. OF THE LAWYERS IN GERMAN POINT IS OBVIOUSLY MY CHILDREN- I DON'T WANT THEM TO GROW UP THE SAME WAY I DID- BECAUSE I CAME FROM A GREAT HOME MY MOM WAS A SINGLE MOTHER UNDOCUMENTED INDIVIDUAL SHE WAS WORKING THREE TO FOUR JOB SO SHE CAN BE HOME TO TAKE CARE OF ME EVEN F SHE WANTED TO SO WE GAVE YOU A LOT OF FREE TIME TO DO WHAT I WANTED. SO WHO- WHICH GOT ME IN TROUBLE SO WHEN I HAD MY% KIDS ARE YOU KNOW IMMEDIATELY I WAS LIKE I CANNOT PUT MY KIDS THROUGH THE SAME THING THAT I WENT THROUGH AND I HAVE THE UPPER HAND BY YOU KNOW HAVING ALL THESE RESOURCES OFFERED FOR ME MY MOM WORKED SO HARD FOR YOU TO BE YOU KNOW THE PERSON THAT I AM SO I OWE IT TO MY KIDS. TO GET THEM A BETTER LIFE AS WELL SO THAT THEY WOULDN'T GO TO THE SYSTEM LIKE. SO IMMEDIATE WHEN I WENT STRAIGHT TO COLLEGE EVEN THOUGH I HAD NO IDEA WHAT TO DO. I KNEW THAT I WANTED TO SUCCEED FOR MY CHILDREN AND FOR MYSELF I OWED IT TO MYSELF AS WELL. BECAUSE I KNEW I HAD IT IN ME I JUST HAD TO GET IT OUT OF ME UNLIKE YOU MENTIONED. SO FOR ME THAT WAS MY FUTURE APPOINT AND- JUST LOOKING UP AT PEOPLE DOING. EVERYTHING THAT I WANTED TO DO THAT WENT THROUGH SIMILAR EXPERIENCES ME SOME OF THEM WANT TO WORSE EXPERIENCES THAN ME. AND SEEN THEM. BEING SO SUCCESSFUL IN. ACCOMPLISHING SO MUCH AND THAT WAS REALLY. THE DRIVING FACTOR IF THEY CAN DO IT I CAN DO IT. AND THEN JUST AS I WENT TO WHEN I WAS IN JUVENILE HALL I MEAN. I REALLY HUGE ADVOCATE WHEN I WAS IN THERE I WAS YOU KNOW THEY- WANTED THEY WOULD CALL ME THE JAILHOUSE LAWYER. ADVOCATED FOR ALL THE GIRLS WITH WAS ABOUT PHONE. ABOUT CERTAIN BOOKS WEREN'T ALLOWED TO READ. GETTING I WAS ALWAYS AN ADVOCATE BECAUSE MY MOM TOLD ME I KNOW YOU'RE YOUNG AND I KNOW YOU'RE IN THE SYSTEM BUT WHAT WE SPEAK UP FOR YOURSELF. AND THAT'S THE THAT'S STUCK WITH ME AND WHEN I ENTERED COLLEGE I KNEW I WANTED TO BE AN ATTORNEY I KNEW I WANTED TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN MY COMMUNITY SO THAT INDIVIDUALS WOULDN'T GO TO THE SAME THING AS ME SO KIDS. COULD HAVE A BETTER OPPORTUNITY TO RE ENVISION THEIR FUTURES AND UNDERSTAND THAT THEY BELONG IN THESE INSTITUTIONS. WELL IN ORDER TO DO THAT. I HAVE TO START NETWORKING I HOW TO START ADVOCATING. ALL MANUALLY HOW TO YOU KNOW GET IT TOGETHER I WANTED TO GO TO YOU YOU SEE I UC BERKELEY AND I DID EVERYTHING I COULD TO GET THERE- I'M TALKING FAMILIES STRUGGLING. STUDENT AND I'VE WORKED REALLY. HAS NOT BEEN EASY. I'VE DONE HONORS PROGRAM. I YOU KNOW I GET PROFESSORS AT UCLA REACH OUT TO ME I LOVE YOUR RESEARCH- TO MAKE IT UP FOR ONE OF THE ENGLISH DEPARTMENT CONFERENCES. AND JUST HEARING. THAT IS ALWAYS CONSTANT REMINDER LIKE I NEEDED OUT. AND I'M SUCH AN INSPIRATION I HAVE. EVERYTHING PROJECT CHANGE TAUGHT ME I NOW TEACH TO OTHER STUDENTS RIGHT NOW IDEA SAM I LITERALLY HAVE. FUND THAT'S YES I'M CALLING ME LIKE. I'M ABOUT TO APPLY TO UC'S WHAT DO I DO PLEASE HELP ME AND NOW I'M THEIR MENTOR NOW I'M MOTIVATING THEM AND OUT ON THEIR INSPIRATION JUST LIKE. KENNEDY ONCE MORE INSPIRATION LIKE NICK WAS MY INSPIRATION. SO GLAD TO BE THAT PERSON FOR THEM AND- I WOULDN'T BE ABLE. TO DO THAT WITHOUT ON PURSUING HIGHER AT. THANK YOU- IS WALDRON AND BUSINESSLIKE. HI THANK YOU- I'M EXCITED TO HEAR EVERYTHING THAT YOU'RE DOING BECAUSE- I'VE BEEN WORKING IN THE SOME OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM SPACE FOR. ALMOST TEN YEARS. AND I ALWAYS GET FRUSTRATED BECAUSE- THE LACK OF. PROGRAMS YOU KNOW ESPECIALLY IN THE CDC AND THE CHECK JUST TRYING TO GET PEOPLE INTO THOSE PROGRAMS AND THE FACILITIES ARE STILL LACKING AND THINGS LIKE THAT SO. WITH THE DJJ ISSUE WITH THE YOU KNOW CLOSING. THE FACILITIES AND HOW IS THAT GOING TO IMPACT THE PROGRAM AND HOW YOU PIVOTING AND DOING WHAT YOU'RE DOING BECAUSE- YOU'RE- WORKING WITH PEOPLE OR INSIDE AS WELL AS PEOPLE ALREADY. WERE PREVIOUSLY INCARCERATED. SO HOW DOES ALL THAT HAS THE KIND OF WORK. SO I THINK ONE OF THE- IT'S A RICH I MEAN THAT'S SUCH A GIFT THAT THIS IS THE SHIFT RIGHT- AND I THINK A HUGE PART OF THIS TO EVEN LOGISTICALLY IS THAT THE MESSAGES IS THAT YOUNG PEOPLE SHOULD BE IN THEIR HOME COMMUNITIES ACCESSING SERVICES- AND THAT'S ALSO WHAT THIS PROGRAM IN PROGRAMS LIKE THIS. ARE ABOUT- WHICH IS THAT IT'S MORE ABOUT THEIR LIVES ONCE THEY'RE IN THE COMMUNITY- IN FACT ESPECIALLY WITH YOUNG PEOPLE- AND OUR SHIFT IN THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM NOW WE ALSO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO RE ENVISION WHAT JUVENILE JUSTICE LOOKS LIKE- BUT WHERE INSTEAD OF YOUNG PEOPLE BEING AND FACILITIES THEY CAN BE IN THEIR HOME COMMUNITIES BEING DUALLY ENROLLED BEING IN CLASSES HAVING WRAPAROUND SUPPORT SERVICES AND THERE'S A REAL OPPORTUNITY WITH THESE THINGS HAPPENING. TO HAVE THAT BE MORE OF THE STRUCTURE- ESPECIALLY FOR YOU- SO THAT'S A HUGE PART OF WHAT WE WANT TO SHARE TODAY BECAUSE THAT'S PART OF WHAT THE PROGRAM IS DONE AS WELL AS YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE BEEN RELEASED EARLY TO BE ABLE TO TAKE COURSES AT THE CAMPUS- OR OF HAD A DIVERSION WHERE THEY'RE NOT INCARCERATED AT ALL AND THEY'RE INVOLVED IN COURSES AND- DO YOU KNOW THAT SOCIAL COMPONENT AND ALL THE WRAPAROUND SUPPORT SERVICES. AND SO- THAT'S THAT'S WHAT I THINK IS REALLY EXCITING THAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW TO. AFTER IS IT IT'S YOUR QUESTION IS A LARGE SELECTION- WELL FIRST OF ALL LET ME- CONGRATULATE YOU ALL FOR YOUR SUCCESS THAT THAT YOU ANY VOTE WHAT YOU'VE OVERCOME IT IT'S PRETTY REMARKABLE- I WOULD SAY I HAVE TO REALLY STRONG QUESTIONS. BECAUSE WHAT SEEMS WHAT'S BEEN MY EXPERIENCE AND RELATING TO- THIS PARTICULAR POPULATION THAT WE'RE ADDRESSING HERE IS THERE'S A LOT OF TRUST THAT'S BEEN LOST. BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENS IS THERE'S A LOT OF EARLY SETBACKS AND SELF ESTEEM GOES WAY DOWN. AND- TO COMPETE IN A COLLEGE ATMOSPHERE I DON'T CARE IF IT'S COMMUNITY COLLEGE OR NOT. IT'S HARD ESPECIALLY IF YOU DON'T HAVE. THE APTITUDE SKILLS LIKE WRITING THAT JUST SOMETHING AS BASIC AS BEING ABLE TO PUT TOGETHER A PARAGRAPH THAT'S EANINGFUL UNDERSTANDABLE AND- I'M TELLING YOU IT'S NOT AN EASY SKILL TO FIND PEOPLE WHO. GRADUATE FROM HIGH SCHOOL MUCH LESS THOSE WHO HAVE HAD TO SKIP SCHOOL IN BECAUSE OF INCARCERATION OR SOME OTHER CIRCUMSTANCE SO THE REALITY IS YOU'VE GOT TO DEVELOP SOME VERY POWERFUL SKILLS WITH VERY LOW SELF CONFIDENCE. AND THAT'S A VERY SCARY. IN RECIPE RIGHT THERE BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO HAVE WRITING SKILLS YOU HAVE TO ALSO HAVE STUDY SKILLS RIGHT YOU HAVE TO REVIEW YOU HAVE TO STUDY AND YOU ALSO. HAVE TO KNOW HOW TO TAKE NOTES IN CLASS. RIGHT I MEAN THESE ARE THINGS THAT PEOPLE TAKE FOR GRANTED THAT HAVE NOT GONE TO COLLEGE I'M TELLING EVERYONE OF THOSE SKILLS IF YOU DON'T HAVE ONE OF THEM. YOU'RE YOU'RE BOUND TO HAVE FAILURE IS WHAT OU'RE BOUND TO HAVE. AND SO. EVEN THOUGH YOU KNOW THESE DOORS HAVE BEEN OPENED. YOU STILL HAVE TO COMPETE YOU STILL HAVE TO PROVE YOURSELF YOU STILL HAVE TO BE ABLE TO FIND SUCCESS ECAUSE IF YOU DON'T. THEN YOU'VE ALMOST CREATED A DISSERVICE BECAUSE NOW YOU'VE GOTTEN A COLLEGE YOU PHILLIP I CAN'T DO IT. I JUST CAN'T DO IT THAT'S A BAD SCENARIO AND SO WHAT I'M- CURIOUS ABOUT. IS HOW DO YOU OVERCOME THOSE OBSTACLES WHEN YOU HAVE THAT. PARTICULAR SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES FACING YOU BECAUSE YOU GUYS OF SUCCESSFULLY MANIPULATED THIS- SITUATION. AND ESPECIALLY WITH THE LACK OF TRUST- IT'S SUPER HARD TO SUPER TO GET PEOPLE TO BELIEVE IN THEMSELVES. AND I'M JUST VERY CURIOUS AS TO HOW YOU ACCOMPLISH THAT BECAUSE IT IS A HUGE JOB SCHOOL BUT IT'S A REALITY I'M NOT TRYING TO BE CRITICAL I'M JUST BEING REAL. CONNECT CELTICS OFFERS PLEASE- SO IT'S ACTUALLY I THINK IT'S FUNNY THAT YOU SAY THAT THE FIRST TIME- THE FIRST TIME I WROTE AN ESSAY WAS IN COLLEGE ACTUALLY- I'D I DIDN'T KNOW EMILY FORMAT WAS I DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO STUDY AYE AYE I KNEW NONE OF THIS RIGHT LIKE. K&lt;c.cyan&gt;&lt;/c&gt; TWELVE I WENT TO COURT COMMUNITY SCHOOL YOU KNOW I MEAN THEY GET THE- EDUCATION STOPPED AT LIKE NINTH GRADE LEVEL- IN SO IN COLLEGE IS THE FIRST TIME THAT- I LEARNED HOW TO DO ALL THIS. AND I THINK THAT THE WAY THAT THESE THESE BEARS OVERCOME BECAUSE I DON'T THINK THAT THAT'S A UNIQUE THING FOR ME I THINK IT WAS IT WAS TRUE FOR EVERYBODY PROJECT CHANGE RIGHT- IT'S KATIE WAS VERY INTENTIONAL WITH MAKING RELATIONSHIPS WITH- PROFESSORS ON CAMPUS. THERE- DATE WANTED TO SUPPORTERS. AND SO OUR FIRST SEMESTER IN COLLEGE LIKE. OR MY FIRST SEMESTER AND I THINK FOR EVERY PROJECT CHANGE STUDENT- SHE PICKED OUR CLASSES AND PICKED A PROFESSORS- AND SO MY- MY FIRST SEMESTER IN COLLEGE I TOOK A FOR. A ETHNIC STUDIES CLASS WITH THIS GUY NAMED RUDY RAMIREZ- ACTUALLY PROFESSOR- HE SAT ME DOWN HE TAUGHT ME HOW TO DO MLA HE TELL ME HOW TO. HOW TO WRITE- HE TOOK TIME OUT OF THE OUT OF HIS DAY TO COME AND MEET ME IN HIS OFFICE HOURS AND THINGS LIKE THAT- AND HE'S ACTUALLY STILL ONE OF MY IT LIKE I WOULD CONSIDER HIM. A FRIEND I WAS AT HIS HOUSE FOR LIKE A PUBLIC A COUPLE WEEKS AGO HINA- IN SO IT WAS ABOUT HAVING THOSE THOSE KEY RELATIONSHIPS WITH. WITH FACULTY AND PROFESSORS ON CAMPUS- THAT WE'RE WILLING TO DO THE EXTRA WORK- AND THAT REALLY COMES FROM THE RELATIONSHIP BUILDING COMMUNITY BUILDING- THAT YOU SET THE STAGE WITH FOR. THE YOUNG PEOPLE TO COME INTO. THANK YOU. SO- KATIE THANK YOU FOR ALL OF YOUR INVESTMENTS IF YOU- WHAT ARE SOME OF THE BARRIERS TO EXPANDING THIS MODEL YOU TALKED ABOUT HOW PROJECT CHANGES THAT THE COLLEGES AND TWENTY SIX OTHER CULTURES HAVE SOME SORT OF A PROGRAM SIMILAR OUT THERE WHAT ARE SOME OF THE BARRIERS TO EXPANDING THIS I'D AND HAVING NETWORK OUT OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES. SO I THINK. WITH MOST THINGS ME FINANCIAL IS A HUGE ASPECT BECAUSE THE THINGS THAT THE STUDENTS ARE TALKING ABOUT TO- IS ALSO THAT THERE IS A DEDICATED SUPPORT ON THE CAMPUS- FOR THIS KIND OF PROGRAM STRUCTURE SO- FOR COLLEGE TO BE ABLE TO HIRE SOMEONE AS A FULL TIME POSITION TO BE ABLE TO RUN A PROGRAM LIKE THIS- IS YOU KNOW A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT COST- AND IN OUR CASE. YOU KNOW I WAS AN ADJUNCT AND THEN YOU KNOW TOOK ON CERTAIN DUTIES AND WAS CREATING IT WHILE I WAS TEACHING AND SO ON AND SO FORTH AND THEN EVENTUALLY YOU KNOW THAT COLLEGE INVESTED THE FUNDS- TO BE ABLE POSITION- BUT THAT'S RARE AND SO IN ORDER FOR- YOU KNOW THE MAJORITY OF COLLEGE CAMPUSES TO BE ABLE TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS IT REALLY DOES- THAT DEDICATED. FUNDING STRUCTURE- INCLUDING FOR COUNSELING STAFF- AND A RETENTION SPECIALIST IS THE STRUCTURE THAT'S BEEN CREATED AT THIS POINT- AND WE'VE SEEN THAT WITH YOU KNOW PROJECT REBOUND I'M NOT UNDERGROUND SCHOLARS AND PROGRAMS THAT ARE REALLY SUCCESSFUL LIKE THAT- THAT IF SUPPORTED STUDENTS WHO HAVE BEEN. THROUGH THE JUSTICE SILT FILIPPIS CURRENTLY ALLOW FOR THIS TYPE OF PROGRAM INSIDE. SO IT I MEAN IT'S ALL ACROSS CALIFORNIA AT THIS POINT- I MEAN THIS. THIS IS OBVIOUSLY SAN MATEO COUNTY- BUT SAN FRANCISCO IS DOING THIS WORK- AND WE'RE WORKING WITH THEM- ALSO TO BE ABLE TO. EXPAND THEIR PROGRAMMING- L. A. COUNTY- SAN DIEGO I MEAN THE LIST IS PRETTY LONG- PALOMAR HE HASN'T SAN DIEGO. ANYWAY IT'S QUITE EXPENSIVE ACTUALLY WHERE PEOPLE ARE ENGAGED IN THE WORK AT DIFFERENT LEVELS- WERE EITHER THEY HAVE YOU KNOW SOME DEDICATED STAFF TIME FOR FOLKS OR AND THEY HAVE A STUDENT CLUB THAT SET UP- SO IT'S PIECES OF THE PROGRAM FOR JUVENILE JUSTICE BUT NOT THE FULL STRUCTURE. NINE QUESTIONS- YOU GUYS HAVE ANY LAST I GUESS ADVICE OR COMMENTS YOU WANT TO SHARE WITH US. THANK YOU FOR HAVING US- AND AGAIN JUST WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT THIS IS REALLY AN EXCITING MOMENT JUVENILE JUSTICE- AND LOOKING AT THINGS DIFFERENT- FOR YOUNG PEOPLE TO HAVE ACCESS TO HIGHER EDUCATION AND PATHWAYS SO- IT'S GREAT TO. TAKE CONNECT WITH OLIVIA. YEAH AND I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU GUYS FOR TAKING THE TIME JUST TO EVEN LISTEN AND YOU KNOW BE HERE I DO REALLY APPRECIATE YOU GUYS YOU KNOW A LOT OF DOES MEAN A LOT TO ME BECAUSE- THIS IS BIG FOR ME SO. I LOVE IT I APPRECIATE YOU GUYS THANK YOU. COMPLETION YEAH OF US A SEVERE EARTHQUAKE- I THINK SOMETHING THAT THAT THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT ESPECIALLY IN IN IN THE REALM OF JUVENILE JUSTICE I IS IT- YOU HAVE OPPORTUNITY TO STOP THE SCHOOL TO PRISON PIPELINE RIGHT- SO YOU YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO STOP PEOPLE FROM EVER GETTING INTO PRISON AND- STOPPING THEM OTHER YOUNG AND- THEIR BRAINS ARE STILL DEVELOPING YOU YOU HAVE THEY HAVE SO MUCH ABILITY TO. TO CHANGE AND TO NOT EVEN REHABILITATE BECAUSE YOU CAN'T YOU CAN'T RESTORE SOMEBODY TO SOMETHING THAT THEY NEVER WERE RIGHT YOU GOT YOU HAVE OPPORTUNITIES TO BUILD YOUNG PEOPLE- INTO LEADERS AND- SO HOPEFULLY ONE DAY THEY CAN SIT NEXT TO YOU RIGHT- AND SO THAT THEY CAN DO THIS WORK IN IN PUSH IT FORWARD- IN UP FACETED JACKIE SO SHE CAN SAY ANYTHING. YEAH THINKING NECK- I JUST WANT TO SAY JUST LIKE NICK SAID YOU DEFINITELY- OF THE POWER TO. MOVIES YOU THREE AND THEIR FUTURES- BECAUSE THEY GET CAN GET REALLY DIFFICULT TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT I MEAN WHEN I WAS INCARCERATED I WISH THERE WAS A PROGRAM THAT WOULD COME IN AND SAY HEY- SOME CALL CLASSES YOU CAN YOU CAN KERN AROMA WHILE YOU'RE IN HERE YOU DON'T HAVE TO. SIT IN THE CLASSROOM AND DO A PACKET OF WORK BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT ACT LEVEL- I WISH I HAD SOMEONE TO COME IN AND TELL ME THAT I WAS GOOD ENOUGH TO GO TO COLLEGE THAT I WAS ABLE TO MAKE IT JUST LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE HAS. AND YOU KNOW I DIDN'T HAVE THAT I HAVE TO SEEK OUT ON MY OWN WHICH I WAS ABLE TO DO BUT IT WAS NOT EASY TO DO AT ALL. AND FEEL LIKE IF I WOULD HAVE HAD THE SUPPORT SYSTEM THAT PROJECT CHANGE OFFERS FROM THE TIME I WAS IN JUVENILE HALL. I WOULD HAVE. PROBABLY MY LIFE WILL PROBABLY HAVE BEEN A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT EVEN THOUGH I'M VERY PROUD OF WHERE I AM. BUT I DEFINITELY WISH THAT I WOULD HAVE GOT THAT HELP. AHEAD OF TIME BECAUSE I COULD HAVE GOT STARTED. EARLY SO I JUST WANT TO EMPHASIZE THE IMPORTANCE THE IMPORTANT STUFF. PROGRAMS LIKE THIS STATE MAKES SUCH A HUGE IMPACT ON OUR LIVES AND- THEY ARE A HUGE REASON WHY WE ARE ABLE TO REACH THE LEVEL OF SUCCESS THAT WE HAVE. SO YEAH THANK YOU AGAIN FOR HAVING US HERE.
