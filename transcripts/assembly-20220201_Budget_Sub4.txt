UNDER PUBLICATIONS. AND I WILL CALL YOU GET TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS S. BUSINESS. AND CRACKED PROGRAM. THANK YOU MISS GRAY- MISTER LUCKY DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS AT THE MOMENT. THANK YOU FOR THAT. I DO HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS MISS GRAY- WE SENT OVER A FEW SLIDES BEFORE THE HEARING AND WANTED TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE DATA COLLECTED. IS IT MY UNDERSTANDING THAT WE DID NOT COLLECT INFORMATION ON THE APPLICANT POOLS BUT ONLY ON THE AWARD EASE AND IF SO WHAT WAS THE REASONING BEHIND THAT. THAT IS CORRECT. AND WE DO NOT COLLECT AN APPLICANT DEMOGRAPHIC DATA WE ONLY COLLECTED DATA ON A WARRANTIES. AND THAT INFORMATION IS PROVIDED VOLUNTARILY. AND IF I CAN SPEAK FRANKLY. WE JUST DON'T HAVE GOOD DATA ON SMALL BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA- THAT SMALL BUSINESS. AND LICENSING AND PERMITTING IT'S DONE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. AND WE DON'T HAVE A PROGRAM TO COLLECT DATA ON OUR OWN. ADDITIONALLY WE HAVE LIMITATIONS ON THE COLLECTION. OF PERSONAL IDENTIFYING INFORMATION. TO DO PROPOSITION TWO ONE NINE. NO THANK YOU FOR THAT I AND I'M JUST CRIOUS AS TO IFI WERE TO ASK WHAT IS THE PERCENTAGE OF WOMEN THAT APPLIED. FOR THE GRANT VERSUS THE PRCENTAGE OF WOMEN THAT WERE AWARDED A SMALL BUSINESS GRANT HOW WOULD YOU PROVIDE ME WITH THAT INFORMATION. I WOULD BE ABLE TO PROVIDE YOU WITH THE INFORMATION- THE NUMBER OF WOMEN OWNED BUSINESSES THAT HAVE BEEN AWARDED WE ARE INDEED TRACKING THAT DEMOGRAPHIC AND FIFTY THREE PERCENT. OF THE GRANT AWARDS TO DATE TO- HELP ON TO WOMEN OWNED FIRMS. I BUT IT IN REGARDS TO THE APPLICANT POOL ITSELF I WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THAT DATA. AND IS THAT A DECISION THAT WAS LIKE HOW IS CAN YOU. REPEAT EXPLAIN AS TO HOW THAT DECISION WAS MADE OR WHO MADE THAT DECISION BECAUSE THAT TELLS ME THAT WE DON'T HAVE FULL AND ACCURATE INFORMATION AS TO HOW WE CAN HELP. UP WOMEN UP SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS ACTUALLY APPLY IF WE DON'T KNOW HOW MANY ACTUALLY DID APPLY. THAT'S AN EXCELLENT POINT- AND UNFORTUNATELY I'M LIMITED BY- THAT THE LOSS OF THE LAMBS AND PROP TWO OH NINE PREVENTS US FROM DOING THAT. THANK YOU NO I UNDERSTAND THE PROP TO A NINE IS KNOW IT IS A VOLUNTARY BASED INFORMATION BUT- WHEN. WHEN SOMEBODY WAS APPLYING WAS THERE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM TO DISCLOSE THAT INFORMATION OR WAS THAT ONLY AFTER. ON A VOLUNTEER BASIS. YES THE YOUNG FOR ME IS THE INFORMATION ON THE IS PROVIDED ON A VOLUNTEER BASIS AND I'M GONNA CALL HIM A COLLEAGUE FOR HISTORY AS IT WAS- NOT IN THE SEAT AT THE TIME THAT THE PROGRAM ORIGINALLY STARTED SO I MIGHT AS- ALL TO HELP PROVIDE SOME OF THE HISTORICAL- DECISION MAKING ON THIS IF THAT'S THE RIGHT. CHAIR MADAM CHAIR SURE THAT'LL BE GREAT THANK YOU. NO HI CHAIR CARILLO GOOD GREAT TO SEE YOU AGAIN- THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO JUMP IN HERE SO WHEN YOU YES THREE APPLICATION PROCESS SOME DEMOGRAPHIC DATA IS COLLECTED HOWEVER IT'S ALL DE AGGREGATED IN THE DECISION MAKING PROCESS. SO THIS WAS ALL MY INTENTION TO ENSURE THAT OUR DECISION MAKING IS AN ACE ON- INDIVIDUALIZED INFORMATION- I'M NOT SURE IF WE ARE ABLE TO THE AGGREGATE THAT ONCE THE PROGRAM IS COMPLETED AND- YOU KNOW BY COMPLETED I MEAN. NO MORE FUNDING AND NO MORE ADDITIONAL ROUNDS- THAT IS SOMETHING THAT I'M SURE WE CAN CIRCLE BACK WITH THE ADMINISTRATOR ON TO SEE IF WE CAN- IF THAT CAN BE QUITE BACK TO EACH APPLICANT- HOWEVER BECAUSE AGAIN IT'S TERRY SAID JUST TO REINFORCE BECAUSE THE LAW IS WHAT IT IS IN CALIFORNIA. WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT NONE OF OUR DECISIONS WERE BASED ON ETHNICITY OR SEX OR THAT TYPE OF THING I THINK YOU IDENTIFIES UNDERSERVED BUSINESSES AND SO THAT IS WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IN ADDITION TO THE OTHER CRITERIA THAT THE ALGORITHM IS BASED ON LIKE THE GROUP LIKE THE. BLUEPRINT LIKE GEOGRAPHY AND SO FORTH. THANK YOU MISTER HAD A- YEAH JUST REAL CENTER TALKING ABOUT THE LITTLE OF ACCOUNTABILITY AND OUTCOMES- WHAT. ONE OF THE BIG OVERALL ARCHING QUESTIONS I HAVE IS WHETHER OR NOT GO BUSINESS BEEN ABLE TO IMPLEMENT THE- THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET ACT PROGRAMS. AFFECTED LEE AND- BECAUSE WE'RE ASKING FOR MORE. GOMEZ NOW IS ASKING AND- YOUR MY QUESTION IS DO THEY HAVE THE CAPACITY TO ADMINISTER NEWLY PROPOSED EFFORTS WHEN WE'RE NOT REALLY SURE THE ITEMS WE FUNDED LAST YEAR BEEN ACCOMPLISHED. IS THERE ANY KIND OF METRIC THAT WE CAN LOOK AT THAT HELPS US DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT- THEY'RE BEEN POSITIVE OUTCOMES MEASURED. I'M ASSEMBLY MEMBER HAPPY TO. ADDRESS THAT I JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR- ARE YOU SPEAKING OF ALL OF THE PROGRAMS OR ARE YOU WANTING TO DIVE DEEPER INTO THEIR SMALL BUSINESS COVERT RELIEF GRANT PROGRAMS.

THANK YOU FOR THAT IT LOOKS SOUNDS LIKE WE STILL HAVE OUR HANDS FULL TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUT- YEAH BLESSING YOUR WAY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MR LACKEY- MISS GREAT WE HAVE A COUPLE OF FROM MEMBERS ARE VERY INTEREST OBVIOUSLY IN SUPPORTING THEIR SMALL AND THEIR OWN COMMUNITIES WHICH IS WHY I'M ASKING THE WHY HOW DO WE NEED TO STE AT THE END OF THE DAY GATHERED AT DATARAN IT'S NOT A I BELIEVE A PARTISAN ISSUE WE ALL WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT ARE SMALL BUSINESSES ARE SUCCESSFUL AND THAT WE ARE OUT DOING THE OUTREACH NECESSARY. SO FROM OTHER MEMBERS IN THIS IS A DID GO BIZ DESIGN OR APPROVE AN OUTREACH STRATEGY FOR THE FOUR BILLION GRANT PROGRAM CAN YOU PLEASE DESCRIBE THE OUT RE STRATEGY USED BY THE FISCAL AGENT TO DEPLOY THESE FUNDS INCLUDING FUNDING AMOUNTS AND WHICH ORGANIZATIONS WERE DESIGNATED TO FOCUS ON WHICH GROUPS OF SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS AND IN WHICH AREAS I KNOW YOU'RE NEW TO THE POSITION SO IT'S A LOT TO TAKE ON AND I HOPE THAT YOU CERTAINLY APPRECIATE WHERE WE'RE COMING FROM IN TERMS OF TRYING TO JUST ENSURE THAT. THIS PROGRAM THAT THE OUTRAGE NECESSARY AMID A PANDEMIC. YES MADAM CHAIR. IN I CAN APPRECIATE THE PROGRAM ACTUALLY FROM BOTH SIDES AND BECAUSE WHEN THE PROGRAM. LAUNCHED AND I WAS ONE OF THOSE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROVIDERS. AND RECEIVED. THE INVITATION TO PARTICIPATE IN THE ALPS REACH NETWORK. I AM VERY PROUD. OF THE WORK THAT OUR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE NETWORK HAS DONE- ON THIS GRANT PROGRAM. WE HAVE MORE THAN EIGHTY CENTERS THAT HAVE PROVIDED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND ONE ON ONE SUPPORT. TO THE BUSINESSES ACROSS THE STATE IN THIRTY DIFFERENT LANGUAGES. AND THAT IS NO SMALL FEAT- V. OUTREACH MATERIALS WORK WORK NEEDED. ON THE USING. OUR INTERMEDIARY ENDS THE INFLECT. OF EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THOSE CENTERS AND THESE ARE BOTH FEDERALLY. FUNDED CENTERS TO ENUNCIATE NONPROFIT- CENTERS THAT HAVE PARTICIPATED IN THIS AND FRANKLY I DON'T THINK THAT THE PROGRAM WOULD HAVE EXPERIENCED THAT LEVEL OF SUCCESS THAT IT HAS. TO DATE. WERE IT NOT FOR THE INPUT END IT VERY VALUABLE EXPERTISE. THAT OUR NETWORK OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CENTERS AND PARTNERS. HAVE BROUGHT TV AFTER. AND GIVEN GIVEN THE- NUMBER OF SMALL BUSINESSES THAT HAVE BEEN AWARDED WE NOW HAVE A DATABASE OF A REALLY GREAT NETWORK OF SMALL BUSINESSES THAT WE DID NOT HAVE BEFORE WHAT ARE WE DOING WITH THIS NETWORK AND HOW ARE WE CONNECTING THEM TO ADDITIONAL RESOURCES AND ARE THEY ALREADY CONNECTED AND- ARE THERE ANY BARRIERS TO ACCESS I KNOW IN THE LAST HEARINGS THAT WE HAD. LANGUAGE WAS A BARRIER TO ACCESS TO- READILY AVAILABLE WIFI OR EVEN UNDERSTANDING HOW THE PROCESS WORKS AND HOW ARE WE BUILDING ON THIS PROGRAM. EXCELLENT QUESTION- THAT IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT MY TEAM IS WORKING ON NOW ON THE IS COLLECTING THAT DATA AND UTILIZING THAT DATA MOVING FORWARD I AGREE WITH YOU ONE HUNDRED PERCENT- THERE IS A LOT OF DATA AVAILABLE BUT WE DO WANT TO UNDERSCORE THAT WE HAVE AGAIN NOT COLLECTED BIG DATA. ON ALL OF THE APPLICATIONS BUT WE DO HAVE THE DATA ON ON HER TO DISSIPATING BUSINESSES ARE PART BUSINESSES THAT HAVE BEEN AWARDED AND IT IT IT IT WOULD BE MY DREAM TO BE ABLE TO LEVERAGE THAT AND TO PROVIDE DEEPER AND WIDER I SERVICES TO THE SMALL BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA. DO YOU HAVE A DATE IN MIND IN WHICH THAT THAT IT'S GOING TO BE COLLECTED IN A REPORT OF SOME KIND AND IF SO BY ONE. WE WILL COMPILE A PORTION OF THAT IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT WHICH WE SHOULD BE PUBLISHING. THIS SPRING  WE HAVE A DRAFT OF THAT REPORT READY NOW- AND WE ARE GOING TO THE PROCESS. OKAY THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL CALLS FOR A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS ADDITIONAL TO CLOSE OUT THE EXISTING APPLICATIONS FOR THE GRANT PROGRAM. ONCE THAT'S COMPLETED. DO CAN WE GET A COMMITMENT FROM YOU TO DO THE AGGREGATED DATA IN TERMS OF WHAT YOU ARE ABLE TO OBTAIN FROM THE VOLUNTEERED. INFORMATION THAT PROP TWO OH NINE DOES NOT ALLOW US TO EXPLICITLY ASK BUT HAS BEEN VOLUNTEERED BY SOME SO THAT WE GET A CLEARER PICTURE AS TO THE DEMOGRAPHY OF THE OR THE DEMOGRAPHICS I SHOULD SAY OF THOSE THAT APPLIED INCOMPLETE. AND- THE PROCESS OF- THOSE THAT WERE AWARDED. JUST SO THAT I'M CLEAR ON THE QUESTION I'M HERE ASKING AND WHEN THE PROGRAM IS COMPLETE WILL WE BE ABLE TO PROVIDE DATA ON THE APPLICATIONS AND BE AWARDED. OR ARE YOU JUST SAYING A FULL DEMOGRAPHIC PROFILE OF THOSE ABOARD IT. I A FULL DEMOGRAPHIC PROFILE OF EVERYONE THAT APPLIED. AND ULTIMATELY WILL BE AWARDED ONCE THE ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION IF WE GET TO THAT IS COMPLETED. MEANING THE FINAL REPORT RIGHT NOW THE REPORT THAT WE HAVE BASED ON THE GRANTEES THAT WERE PROVIDED GIVE US A SMALL GLIMPSE RIGHT OF PERCENTAGES OF. WOMEN OWNED BLACK OWNED MINORITY OWNED LATINO OWNED AT CETERA. BUT IT'S NOT A FULL PICTURE RIGHT BECAUSE THERE ARE STILL APPLICATIONS THAT ARE PENDING AND THE ADDITIONAL HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION FROM MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE IS WE WANT TO KNOW. WHAT ARE THE WHAT ARE THE RESOURCES THAT WENT OUT LIKE WHAT IS THAT PROFILE LOOK LIKE AND HOW CAN WE EXPAND ACCESS AND RESOURCES SO THAT'S WHAT I'M ASKING YOU ONCE WE GET THROUGH THE ENTIRE PROCESS. WILL YOU BE ABLE TO PROVIDE BASED ON THE DATA THAT YOU HAVE A MORE COMPLETE PROFILE OF EVERYONE THAT APPLIED. YES MA'AM I'M SURE WE WILL- CERTAINLY ASKING AND HOW THAT CAN BE DONE. AND WE WILL SHARE EVERY BIT OF THE INFORMATION THAT THAT WE HAVE. I AND I DON'T KNOW WHETHER OR NOT MORE ALL YOU WANT TO JUMP IN HERE IS THERE IF THERE'S SOMETHING THAT YOU FEEL I'M I AM I MISSING ON THIS ANSWER. YEAH OF COURSE OF COURSE BOTTOM SHARE WE WILL ABSOLUTELY PROVIDE THE DATA WHICH WE CAN- THAT WHICH YOU KNOW HOW HOWEVER UNLESS YOU CAN PROVIDE IT TO US- THAT'S NOT AN ISSUE I MEAN FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE GRANT ADMINISTRATION WE REALLY NEED TO THE SEPARATED IN THE AGGREGATE WHICH I KNOW I KNOW YOU. I KNOW YOU GET THAT WE JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT CANNOT BE PATCHED BACK TOGETHER. ADDITIONALLY ON THE OUTREACH PIECE OF IT I DON'T CARE SAID THAT- WE ESTABLISHED. A SLEW OF NEW RELATIONSHIPS THROUGH OUR NETWORK OF NOT JUST THE EIGHTY ART. EIGHTY IN THE TAKE NETWORK BUT ALL THE ANCILLARY PARTNERS THAT CAME OUT OF THAT HOLE THE CDFI IS A LOCAL- ORGANIZATIONS AND SO THOSE ARE TOUCH POINTS THAT THE CONTINUE TO HAPPEN BETWEEN THOSE CENTERS AND THOSE SMALL BUSINESSES. OUT LETTING THEM KNOW WHAT RESOURCES ARE AVAILABLE PROVIDING THE NEW INFORMATION ABOUT NEW GRANT PROGRAMS THEY MAY BE ELIGIBLE FOR. AND KEEPING THEM APPRISED OF ANYTHING THAT'S HAPPENING AT THE FEDERAL OR LOCAL LEVEL SHOULD THEY. BE A LOCAL ORGANIZATION. THAT'S WONDERFUL TO HEAR I KNOW THAT I'M NOT ALONE WITH THEM. ENQUIRING ABOUT HOW DO WE SUPPORT OUR SMALL BUSINESSES AND HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE RESOURCES AND OUR SUCCESSFUL. AT ONE FINAL QUESTION BEFORE WE MOVE ON- CAN ALWAYS BE PLEASE PROVIDE A DEMOGRAPHIC BREAKDOWN OF THE INELIGIBLE DUE TO DELINQUENT SOS FILING THURS APPROXIMATELY EIGHTY FIVE HUNDRED APPLICATIONS. AND THE DIDN'T MEET THE VERIFICATION AND VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS- WHICH IS ABOUT FORTY SIX THOUSAND APPLICATIONS. ESL SPEAKING. LIKE TO THE SOS FILINGS WE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER I'M AS SHE POINTED OUT A LITTLE OVER EIGHTY FIVE HUNDRED THAT DEMOGRAPHIC. BREAKS DOWN ON THAT IS SIGNIFICANT AND TELLING THE AN OVERWHELMING NUMBER OF THOSE SMALL BUSINESSES ARE AND OWNED BY A- FOLKS IN OUR DISADVANTAGED- UNITIES AND OVERWHELMING. NUMBER OF STAND ARE.

LET'S HEAR FROM MR WHETHER FORD WITH THE L. L. ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. YES THIS IS BRIAN WITH AFFORDABLE LEGISLATURE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND- WE ARE ON. WE RECOMMENDED REJECTING ADDITIONAL STATE FUNDING FOR THE CALIFORNIA BECAUSE IT APPEARS TO BE UNNECESSARY- SO FIRST WE WOULD KNOW WE WOULD WANT TO DIMINISH THE IMPORTANCE OF TOURISM TO THE STATE'S ECONOMY AND THE PANDEMIC HAS HAD A TERRIBLE IMPACT ON TOURISM BUSINESSES EVEN RELATIVE TO MOST OTHER SECTORS OF THE STATE'S ECONOMY DURING THE PANDEMIC SO I REJECT- OUR RECOMMENDATION IS BASED ON OUR ANALYSIS OF IS THAT CALIFORNIA'S REVENUES AND EXPENDITURES FOR THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS- AND IT ACCOUNTS FOR THE NINETY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN FUNDS THAT ME ON. PROVIDED A BUSY CAL LOS YEAR WELL VISIT CALIFORNIA'S REVENUES DECLINE FROM A HUNDRED TWENTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN TO SEVENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR IN TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE HE ORGANIZATION SHARPLY REDUCE ITS EXPENDITURES AT THE OUTSET OF THE PANDEMIC AND IT PRUDENTLY BUILT ITS FINANCIAL. RESERVES SO WILL DEPRESSED. FOR SOMETIME BECAUSE OF THE PUBLIC CONCERNS. AND WHILE THE BIG. ASSESSMENT OF THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS LIKE WILK LIKELY TO DECLINE MUCH. OR PERHAPS ANY FURTHER AND SO WE FIND THAT THE NINETY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS THAT IS A CALIFORNIA RECEIVED LAST YEAR. REALLY SHOULD BE SUFFICIENT TO ALLOW THE ORGANIZATION TO BE ABLE TO SPEND SOMEONE ABOUT THE PRE PANDEMIC LEVELS. WITHOUT ADDITIONAL STATE FUNDS. THANK YOU FOR THAT MISTER WHETHER FORD ISER SOMEBODY FROM. THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE BUT MANY COME OR QUESTIONS THEM. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR TAMARA JOHNSON DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE HAS ASSEMBLY HAD MENTIONED TOURISM WAS ONE OF THE HARDEST HIT SECTORS- DURING THE PANDEMIC. AND WE CONTINUE TO EXPRESS SUPPORT FOR THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL WE THINK THAT THE FORTY FIVE MILLION IS A REASONABLE INVESTMENT- TO IMPROVE ON IT TO SPUR TOURISM HERE IN CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU. GREAT THANK YOU FOR THAT- NOW WE'RE GOING TO GO TO THE DENTIST FOR QUESTIONS MISTER LUCKY. YEAH JUST REAL QUICKLY- I JUST WONDERED ARE THERE ANY METRICS. THE VISIT CALIFORNIA IMPLEMENTED TO DETERMINE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE NINETY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. FOR THE MARKETING CAMPAIGN. AND IF NOT I MEAN. IT'S PUTS INTO QUESTION WHY WE'RE ADDING FORTY FIVE MILLION MORE. ARE THERE ANY ARE THERE ANY METRICS AND ALL THE WITH YEAH I'M IN NIGER THE SUCCESS OR LACK THEREOF. I'M HAPPY TO TAKE THAT QUESTION THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER LACKEY- WE DO USE BEST IN CLASS AN INDUSTRY STANDARD METHODOLOGY FOR EVALUATING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR TRAVEL MARKETING CAMPAIGNS. IT'S BEEN A STANDARD IN EXISTENCE WITHIN THE INDUSTRY FOR THE BETTER PART OF TWO DECADES- IT'S EARLY DAYS THE BUDGET LANGUAGE- THAT WAS PASSED LAST YEAR- MANDATE TO. AN EXPENSE REPORT AND A AND EFFECTIVENESS REPORTS- BUT I CAN TELL YOU THAT IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF THAT NINETY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR CAMPAIGN TWELVE POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS OF INCREMENTAL REVENUE WAS GENERATED FROM THE STATE'S TRIP TO RISEN BUSINESSES- THAT IS- AGAIN EARLY DAYS SO I'D- I'D SAY PRELIMINARY BECAUSE IT'S FAR FROM COMPLETE. THAT NINETY FIVE MILLION WILL CONTINUE TO GENERATE TRAVEL FOR THE NEXT SIX TO TWELVE MONTHS WILL BE- CAPTURING THAT AN ARTICLE REPORTS OF THE LEGISLATURE. THANK YOU. WHEN THAT FORMER TO THE- BE COMPLETED. THE FIRST PRELIMINARY REPORT THE BUDGET LANGUAGE FROM LAST YEAR- IS DUE BY JULY FIRST AND THEN A BISHOP OF THIS CALENDAR YEAR AND THEN A FULL FINANCIAL IMPACT REPORT IS DUE JULY FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE. GREAT THANK YOU. AT THE L. A- COMMENTS THE VISIT CALIFORNIA REDUCE ITS EXPENDITURES ADDS REVENUE COLLECTIONS BLANK BEGAN TO DECLINE IN TWENTY TWENTY. THIS CALIFORNIA HAS INCREASED ITS NET ASSETS FROM TWENTY MILLION FROM THE TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY TWENTY YEAR TO FIFTY EIGHT MILLION. BY THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO WITH THIS INCREASE IN NET ASSETS HOW DID WAS A CALIFORNIA DETERMINED. THAT FORTY FIVE MILLION WAS NEEDED FOR MEDIA THIS IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET. THE- THE L. A. ANALYSIS REFLECTION OF OUR NET ASSETS AT THE END OF OUR FISCAL YEAR LAST YEAR. I'D LIKE TO REMIND THE COMMITTEE THAT THAT FISCAL YEAR THERE WERE ONLY TWO WEEKS- OF TIME IN THAT ENTIRE FISCAL YEAR WHEN TRAVEL WAS ALLOWED IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THE STATE WAS NOT RE OPEN TO TRAVEL UNTIL JUNE FIFTEENTH OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. SO IT'S REALLY- I THINK THAT NASA NET ASSETS THEY ARE REFLECTED ON THOSE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE A REFLECTION OF- US SLOWING DOWN OUR MARKETING WILL TRAVEL WAS NOT IMPACTED. I CAN TELL YOU THAT WE ARE- IN ADDITION TO SPENDING THE FUNDS THAT WERE GRANTED IN THE BURKE BUDGET PROCESS LAST YEAR WE ARE ACTIVELY SPENDING DOWN THOSE THOSE- INDUSTRY GENERATED FUNDS NOW. OVERALL OUR INDUSTRY COLLECTIONS REMAIN DOWN ABOUT AND WE DO CONTINUE TO SEE THAT- IT IS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE WHILE THE TRAVEL INDUSTRY IS RECOVERING. OUR INDUSTRY- GENERATED FUNDING WILL BE DOWN TO- FOR PROBABLY THE BETTER PART OF TWO TO THREE YEARS. I THANK YOU FOR THAT BUT A SPECIFICALLY. WORDED THE FORTY FIVE MILLION NUMBER COME FROM. FORTY FIVE. IS A- WHAT IS IN KEEP FLAT WITH WHAT ARE. X. ARE YEAR. BASED ON THE NINETY MILLION LAST. OUR INDUSTRY REVENUES HAVE RECOVERED SOMEWHAT FROM THAT LAST YEAR THOSE THOSE DARK EARLY DAYS THE PANDEMIC OF COURSE- SO. FIVE MILLION TO SIMPLY KEEP. WITH ME WE ARE THIS YEAR AND THIS YEAR GARCIA BACK HOME. OF STATE FUNDING THAT THAT NINETY FIVE MILLION PLUS THE INDUSTRY GENERATED FUNDS- WITHOUT AN ADDITIONAL. LEVEL OF FUNDING FROM THE STATE WE WILL HAVE A DROP OFF AND WHAT IS THE CALIFORNIA IS ABLE TO DO. MIGHT ALSO LIKE TO NOTE THAT A 100% OF THESE FUNDS GO DIRECTLY TO THE PAID MEDIA BY. NONE OF THEM GO TO OVERHEAD OF ANY KIND STAFF. SALARIES OR ANYTHING ELSE THAT WOULD- WOULD TAKE AWAY FROM THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THAT- PAID CAMPAIGN. I'M SO GLAD THAT YOU BROUGHT UP THE PAID MEDIA BY. FROM THE MEDIA COMPANIES THAT YOU USE TO DETERMINE THE- WHERE THE YOU KNOW THE DIFFERENT CAMPAIGNS WHAT WENT TO. CAN SOMEONE SHARE HOW MANY OF THOSE- POTENTIAL MARKETING FIRMS ARE PR FIRMS. FOR CALIFORNIA COMPANIES I- OR OR AGENCY OF RECORD ARE ARE MARK FIRM BASED HERE IN SACRAMENTO OF ALL- IN SAN DIEGO AS WELL- THE MEDIA COMPANY THAT THAT- THE- PURCHASES ARE MEDIA AT SCALE FOR THE BOOK. BEST EFFICIENCY ON THESE DOLLARS- IS A GLOBAL COMPANY CALLED ABBAS MEDIA. NOMINATORS CONTRACTOR TO OUR AGENCY OF RECORD THE SHIPYARD AGAIN BASED HERE IN SACRAMENTO. I DON'T HAVE MY FINGERTIPS AN EXACT ACCOUNTING OF. WHICH HEADQUARTERS IT AND SUCH FOR EVERY- EVERY MEDIA PURCHASE THAT WAS MADE I'D BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE COMMITTEE TO PROVIDE MORE DETAILED ANSWER ON THAT. THAT WOULD BE REALLY GREAT SINCE WE'RE USING YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DOLLARS. TO BRING MORE PEOPLE INTO CALIFORNIA TO VISIT CALIFORNIA WHICH WE CERTAINLY WOULD LIKE TO YOU KNOW IN AN EFFORT FOR SAFE ECONOMIC RECOVERY BUT I'M VERY CURIOUS TO KNOW. IF THIS MONEY IS ACTUALLY STAYING WITHIN THE STATE OR IF I'S GOING TO. ANOTHER STATE. PROBABLY LIKE NEW YORK OR A DIFFERENT COMPANY IN WHICH- IS NOT A- CALIFORNIA. SUPPORTED COMPANY. SO BY THANK YOU MY BE ABLE TO GET THAT DONE TO THE CA. I THINK WE COULD PROBABLY HAVE THEM WITHIN A COUPLE OF WEEKS. OKAY WE'LL BE SURE TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT AS WELL. AT LAST YEAR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPERS IDENTIFY THE NEED TO PROVIDE FUNDING TO SUPPORT REGIONAL TOURISM RECOVERY EFFORTS. IS THERE A PARTICULAR REASON WHY THERE'S NO FUNDING PROPOSAL FOR LOCAL AND REGIONAL EFFORTS TO SUPPORT- TOURISM RECOVERY. THE THERE IS A PLAN TO. USE SOME OF OUR INDUSTRY FUNDS TO DO SOME TERRORISM SOME REGIONAL TOURISM PLANNING EFFORTS IT'S A- PROCESS THAT WE HOPE TO KICK OFF AT OUR BOARD MEETING COMING UP HERE IN A COUPLE WEEKS. OF THESE FUNDS- THAT WERE ALLOCATED IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET- WE- ARE KEEPING A BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT WE CAN MEASURE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF. ONCE YOU START TO PULL APART THOSE PAID MEDIA PURCHASES AND USE THOSE FUNDS FOR OTHER THINGS THE METHODOLOGY. AND IT JUST DOESN'T REALLY EXIST TO TRACK AFFECTED. MR CROSS ALL THOSE DIFFERENT CHANNELS. THANK YOU FOR THAT AND COMING SPEAK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE OUTREACH EFFORT FOR THAT LOCAL- SUPPORTING LOCAL REGIONAL EFFORTS- IS THAT DONE IN. ONE LANGUAGE OR MULTIPLE LANGUAGES. IT'S JUST GETTING KICKED OFF THE WITH A LISTENING SESSION WITH OUR BOARD- IN- MID FEBRUARY- AND THEN WE HOPE TO COME OUT OF THAT PLAN. THAT WE HAD CONVERTED- ALL OF OUR- OUTREACH- IN MULTI MULTIPLE LANGUAGES. AND THAT PROBABLY HAPPENED A FEW YEARS AGO SO I WOULDN'T SEE ANY REASON WE WOULDN'T DO. THE SAME THING FOR THIS PROGRAM. DO YOU HAVE A REPORT ON THE PAID MEDIA BY THAT HAS ALREADY TAKEN PLACE IN TERMS OF- LANGUAGES AND AUDIENCES THAT RECEIVED. THAT OUTRAGE. IN TERMS OF THE PAID MEDIA WHAT ARE YOU ASKING WHAT CHANNELS IT WAS TARGETED AT LIKE WHAT HAPPENS IS ENGLISH AND SPANISH AND I CAN PROVIDE A MORE COMPLETE REPORT OF- THE EXACT TARGET AUDIENCE FOR EACH OF THOSE BIASES. THE MEDIA PURCHASES ITSELF I MEAN THOSE ARE ELABORATE AND THAT'S WHY I DON'T HAVE A METHOD AND MY FINGERTIPS THEY ARE- PAGES AND PAGES LONG SO IT WILL TAKE US A FEW DAYS TO PULL THAT TOGETHER AND TELL YOU EXACTLY WHO THE TARGET AUDIENCE WERE FOR EACH OF THEM. BROADLY SPEAKING OUR TARGETS ARE. ADULTS TWENTY FIVE TO FIFTY FOUR DOMESTICALLY IN THE TOP THIRD OF HOUSEHOLD INCOME. I THINK THAT'S IS VERY INTERESTING INFORMATION TO HAVE CONSIDERING THE CALIFORNIA IS ONE OF THE MORE. DIVERSE US STATES IN THE NATION AND YOU NOT ONLY DID. TELEVISION AND LINEAR TV BUYS BUT YOU ALSO DID DIGITAL AND SOCIAL. WHICH GIVES YOU AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO MORE OUTREACH OUTSIDE OF THE TWO LANGUAGES AND I'M CURIOUS IF. YOU ONLY STEP A PARTICULAR REASON WHY WAS ONLY IN TWO LANGUAGES. OR IF THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO MORE- FOR AN EFFORT OF INCREASING THAT AUDIENCE BASE. CERTAINLY IT'S SOMETHING WE LOOK AT WE'RE WE'RE DRIVEN BY EFFECTIVENESS OF THE MARKETING STRATEGY- I THINK IT'S WORTH NOTING THAT OUR EFFORTS ARE FOCUSED PRIMARILY ON OUT OF STATE YEAH WITH THE INTENT TO DRIVE INBOUND TRAVEL TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO IT'S A NET ECONOMIC BENEFIT TO THE STATE. WE DIDN'T DO IN AGAIN DURING PANDEMIC TIMES WE DID DO SOME IN STATE ADVERTISING AND THAT'S WHERE YOU SAW THE SPANISH LANGUAGE MEDIA REALLY COME- BECOME IN THAT BEAT BE VERY HELPFUL WHEN WE WERE TRYING TO KEEP TRAVELERS CALIFORNIANS- TO VACATION THEIR BACKYARD FOR TWO REASONS ONE IT WAS SAFER SAFER FROM A PUBLIC HEALTH RISK. INTO A PREVENTED THE DOLLARS FROM LEAVING THE STATE REVERSING A LOT OF WHAT WE CALL A TRAVEL LEAKAGE TO THE TUNE OF ABOUT A BILLION DOLLARS A MONTH- IN LATE TWENTY TWENTY IN EARLY TWENTY TWENTY ONE WERE CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS WERE LEAVING CALIFORNIA GOING TO ARIZONA GOING TO OTHER STATES. FOR THEIR VACATION SO WE DID EXIST IN SOME OF THAT FUNDING SOME OF THOSE MEDIA DOLLARS TO TRY TO CAPTURE AS MUCH BACK CALIFORNIA ATTENTION AS WE COULD AGAIN FOR THOSE TWO MAIN REASONS HEALTH REASON AND ECONOMIC. DEVELOPMENT RECENT. I THANK YOU FOR THAT I WOULD SAY THAT THE SOUND SLIGHTLY CON. CONSIDERING THAT ONE OF THE- ONE OF THE POINTS THAT WE BROUGHT UP IN LAST YEAR'S HEARING RELATED TO PUBLIC HEALTH IS THAT WE WOULD POTENTIALLY BE BRINGING IN. FOLKS TO CALIFORNIA FROM OTHER STATES THAT WERE UNVACCINATED. AND SO. TO SAY THAT SOMEONE IN LOS ANGELES FOR EXAMPLE WOULD AND TRAVEL TO TOPPLE. AT TO VACATION WITH THEIR FAMILY VERSUS SOMEBODY FROM TEXAS COMING TO CALIFORNIA TO GO TO AN AMUSEMENT PARK- SEEMS KIND OF CONTRADICTORY BECAUSE WITH THE CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA'S LARGE GOOD FOR MULTIPLE STATES IN CALIFORNIA YOU CAN BE IN SAN DIEGO AND NEVER TRAVEL TO SAN FRANCISCO YOU COULD BE. AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND NEVER HAVE GONE TO- OF SAN DIEGO OR OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE WHILE STILL KEEPING THOSE DOLLARS WITHIN CALIFORNIA. WHICH IS STILL AN ISSUE WITH PUBLIC HEALTH AND FOLKS IN CALIFORNIA BEING VACCINATED VERSUS BRINGING IN OTHER DOLLARS FROM OTHER STATES AND POTENTIALLY CAUSING A RISK OF ADDITIONAL- CONTAMINATION BY THE VIRUS. WHICH IS WHY I'M JORDY OF OUR MEDIA BY WAS REALLY POSITION FOR AFTER THE STATE WAS REOPENED TO TRAVEL WE WORKED IN CLOSE COORDINATION WITH CDPH THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE WE CAN AND WE CONTINUE TO DO SO THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE PANDEMIC- TO MAKE SURE THAT WHAT WE WERE SAYING- FROM THE- FROM THE PLATFORM OF INSPIRING TRAVEL WITHIN INTO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS ONLY DECIDE I SERVE AS THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR THE INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS AND TRADE TEAM AT GO THIS GENERATIONS OF IMMIGRANTS AROUND THE GLOBE HAVE SHAPED CALIFORNIA'S HISTORY AND PROGRESS TODAY IMMIGRANTS COMPRISE 27% OF OUR STATE POPULATION WELL HALF OF ALL CHILDREN IN CALIFORNIA HAVE AT LEAST ONE IMMIGRANT PARENTS. IT'S WHETHER THEY ARRIVE TO SEEK SAFETY OR OPPORTUNITY. ALL CALIFORNIA'S IDENTITY AND ECONOMIC GROWTH FOR MULTIPLE GENERATIONS AND CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN A NATIONAL LEADER IN DEVELOPING POLICIES AND PROGRAMS AIM TO SUPPORT OUR STATE'S DIVERSE IMMIGRANT COMMUNITY PARTICULARLY TO ADDRESS DISPARITIES IN ACCESS TO HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AND TO ENHANCE CRITICAL LABOR AND WORKFORCE PROTECTIONS. EXPANDING THIS EXPERTISE WITHIN THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND INTERNATIONAL PORTFOLIO AT KOBE IS THE NEXT CHAPTER ON CALIFORNIA'S PROGRESS TO ADVANCE IMMIGRANT INTEGRATION IN EQUITY WITH THAT IN MIND WE ARE REQUESTING ELEVEN POINT SIX MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND IN TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE. AND FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ANNUALLY THEREAFTER FOR THIS PROPOSAL WHICH SERVES TWO PRIMARY FUNCTIONS FIRST IT AIMS TO ADDRESS GAPS IN RESOURCES TO SUPPORT STATEWIDE CONVENING IN COORDINATION THROUGH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE THAT IS POPULATION FOCUSED ACROSS THE PORTFOLIOS OF OUR STATE AGENCY PARTNERS. IMMIGRATION EVENTS IN RECENT YEARS HAVE HIGHLIGHTED THE BENEFITS AND IMPORTANCE OF COORDINATION ACROSS STATE GOVERNMENT TO SUPPORT EFFECTIVE RESPONSE. INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS AND TRADE HIM ALREADY PLAYS A UNIQUE ROLE AS A CONVENER THE STATE INCLUDING ON ISSUES TO THE BORDER AND OTHER INTERNET AFFAIRS AND IS WELL POSITIONED TO SUPPORT STATEWIDE COORDINATION ON IMMIGRATION EXPERTISE ACROSS GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS AND SERVICES. SECONDS THIS PROPOSAL BUILT ON THE STATE INVESTMENT IN ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY. FOR ENTREPRENEURSHIP. IT DOES THIS THROUGH ONE TIME FOR LOCAL GUY TO HELL CITIES AND COUNTIES SEAT INTO PLAY BEST PRACTICES AND PROGRAMS AND SERVICES FOR IMMIGRANT ENTREPRENEURS AND BUSINESS OWNERS.

THANK YOU AND I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU BEFORE WE GO ON TO THE L. A. O. AND TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WE'RE GOING TO DO ESTABLISH A QUORUM CAN WE TAKE ROLL CALL PLEASE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER CREW HERE SAM ROBERT COOPER THEY'RE FAMILY MEMBER LACKEY HERE ASSEMBLY MEMBER IN THIS AREA. SAM AND I'M WICKS. ALL RIGHT LET'S CONTINUE THANK YOU SO MUCH- LET'S HEAR FROM SOMEBODY BEFORE WE GO TO THE DIETS THAT SEE US SOMEBODY FROM DELEO MISTER WEATHERFORD. YES HI YES THIS IS BRIAN WITH THE FOR THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND FROM WHAT I'M GOING. TO MISS MY COMMENTS THE EIGHT POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLAR- ONE TIME- GRANT PROGRAM FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. SO I THINK OUR CONCERNS ABOUT THIS FIRMEST IS DONE ON- BUT SOME OF THE DETAILS SEEM TO BE FULLY DEVELOP YET AND SPECIFICALLY- WE'RE NOT REALLY SURE HOW THE PROGRAM ADDRESSES SPECIFIC BARRIERS TO STARTING AND GROWING A BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA YOU NEED TO IMMIGRANTS. AND- HE THE SPECIFIC RETURN THAT THE BIDS USED TO THE GRANT. ARE IS THERE'S A LOT. AND. THERE SHOULD BE. SOME OF REPORT REQUIRED TO VALUE WHETHER THE PER THAT ARE. THANK YOU AS SOMEONE THE OF FINANCE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR TO PARK TOMORROW JOHNSON DEPARTMENT OF FOR- JUST TO- ADDRESS THE L. A. COMES ABOUT- AT THE SPECIFICS TO THE GRANT PRO- WE ARE OPEN TO MAKE CPAS. ON THE GRANTS- IN BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE- SO WE CAN WORK WITH- YOUR STAFF TO- DRAFT WITH THAT WOULD LOOK LIKE. IS THERE ALREADY TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE FOR THIS PROPOSAL. AND THERE IS CURRENTLY NO- TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE DRAFTED OR PROPOSED- BUT WE ARE OPEN TO- THOSE DISCUSSIONS OR INCLUDING- AND SPECIFICS ON THE ON THE GRANT PROGRAM IN BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE EARLY ACTION TO HAVE THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE READY TO GO. NO NOT PRIORITY. ALL RIGHT SKEWS ME ONE MOMENT PLEASE. GOT IT EXCUSE MY COMMENTS THIS IS NOT SLATED FOR EARLY ACTION BUT STILL WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO SEE IF WE CAN FIGURE THAT PIECE OUT AT THE L. A. O. COMMENTS INCLUDE A NUMBER OF KEY QUESTIONS THAT I BELIEVE ARE IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTANDING THIS PCP IF YOU COULD ANSWER. UP WHAT YOU BELIEVE ARE THE KEY BARRIERS TO ECONOMIC INTEGRATION FOR IMMIGRANTS AND HOW- HOW DOES THE PROGRAM OUTLINED IN THE B. C. PEOPLE ADDRESS THOSE BARRIERS CALIFORNIA HAS REMOVED DOCUMENTATION BARRIERS TO STARTING A BUSINESS AND INVESTED IN MICROGRAMS LIMITED. ENGLISH PROFICIENT ENTREPRENEURS. THIS PROPOSAL COMPLEMENTS THOSE EFFORTS WITH ADDITIONAL RESOURCES AT AN ESPECIALLY CRITICAL MOMENT- DESPITE THEIR PURPOSE. FOR ENTREPRENEURSHIP WE KNOW THAT IMMIGRANTS FACE CERTAIN. HURDLES TO STARTING SUSTAINING AND GROWING THEIR OWN BUSINESSES- SO THERE A NUMBER OF KEY BARRIERS I WOULD POINT TO- THAT IMMIGRANTS WHO PER. FACE ACCESS TO CAPITAL TO STARTED. NOT FOR AND LOCAL RESOURCES THAT PROMOTE ENTREPRENEURSHIP. NOW STATE AND LOCAL PROCEDURES FOR STARTING A BUSINESS INCLUDING ACCESS TO RESOURCES AND CULTURALLY COMPETENT NATIVE LANGUAGES. SO THIS PROPOSAL WOULD ADDRESS THOSE BARRIERS IN IN SEVERAL WAYS- WITH PRETTY. AND ON ON THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT. GRANT FUNDING. PROVIDING FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO EXPAND THEIR SERVICE PROVISION TO IMMIGRANT BUSINESS OWNERS AND ENTREPRENEURS. WE FEEL IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT WELL WE WELCOME OF COURSE THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE CONTINUED DISCUSSION WITH THIS COMMITTEE AND WITH OUR PARTNERS THE LEGISLATURE. CRAFT THE CRITERIA FOR THIS PROGRAM WHAT WE WOULD EMPHASIZES. WE WANTED TO KEEP FLEXIBILITY YOU PROGRAM DESIGNED SO THAT LOCAL COMMUNITIES THAT SERVE THESE IMMIGRANT ENTREPRENEURS AND SERVE THE COMMUNITIES. WOULD REALLY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TAILOR THE PROGRAM FOR WHAT'S MOST APPROPRIATE FOR THEIR REGION. THAT SAID WE WOULD CERTAINLY INCORPORATE KEY CRITERIA FOR FUNDING. SO THAT WOULD INCLUDE THINGS LIKE REQUIRING SOLICITATION AND RECOMMENDATIONS FROM COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS AND SERVICE PROVIDERS. THAT REPRESENTATIVE DEMOGRAPHICS OF THE IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES IN THOSE AREAS- WE WOULD PROPOSE USING- DOLLARS CAME. ALIGNMENT WITH THE NEEDS OF IMMIGRANT POPULATIONS IN THE REGION- WE WOULD WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. JURISDICTION'S WHO HAVE A CRITICAL NEEDS RELATED TO SUPPORTING NEW COVER POPULATIONS. ARE ALSO ABLE TO. ACCESS FUNDING AND SEE IT AND DEVELOP AND DEPLOY BEST PRACTICES. FOR IMMIGRANT SERVICES. WHAT WITH REGARD TO THE OTHER THING THE I WOULD MENTION IS MY TEAM INTERNET AFFAIRS AND TRADE. DISPATCHED TO REQUIRE TO SEE AN ANNUAL TO THE THIS THAT WOULD UPS. BE THAT WOULD BE IN IN THAT PUBLICLY. REPORT AND ASK IS DOES WITH OTHER PROGRAMS- THAT WE ADMINISTER FROM THE GRANT PERSPECTIVE WE WOULD BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO PROVIDE REGULAR UPDATES TO THIS COMMITTEE AND EVER ELSE YOU DESIGNATE. ON THE DESIGN OF THE PROGRAM AND THEN RESULT AS THEIR GENERATED. HAS THE PROGRAM DEVELOPS. THANK YOU THAT SAID THAT CERTAINLY A LOT OF- IT'S A BIG BIG GOALS TO ACCOMPLISH AND I'M CURIOUS. THE FUNDING PROPOSAL SUGGESTED THAT ON THAT ADDING ONE PERSON I'D GO BUSINESS. TO SUPPORT A STATEWIDE COORDINATION AND DIRECT RESOURCES TO SUPPORT. IMMIGRANT INTEGRATION THIS LEVEL OF STAFFING SEEMS INSUFFICIENT TO WHAT YOU JUST LAID OUT. OR TO MAKE MEANINGFUL IMPROVEMENTS. HOW DID GO VISIT TURMAN THE SCOPE AND FUNDING FOR THESE ACTIVITIES. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION SHARE THE ONE POSITION I THINK WOULD REALLY BE A POSITION TO EXPAND UPON THE SERVICES THAT ARE ALREADY IN PLACE AND MANY OF OTHER STATE PARTNERS. SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT IMMIGRATION INTEGRATION WEKNOW THAT IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA FACE A RANGE OF NEEDS AND SERVICES SO THIS POSITION WOULD REALLY BE FOCUSED ON PROVIDING FOR THAT COORDINATION. WITH DEPARTMENTS LIKE LABOR AND WORKFORCE WITHIN D. A DSS AND OTHERS THAT HAVE ALREADY IMMIGRANT FOCUSED POSITIONS THAT ARE SERVING COMMUNITIES BUT THE PARTICULAR EXPERTISE THAT THE STATE AGENCIES. SO VERY MUCH TO YOUR POINT WE WOULDN'T PRESUME THAT THIS ONE POSITION WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ENTIRETY OF IT BUT WOULD REALLY BE FOCUSED ON COORDINATION- ACROSS STATE AGENCY PARTNERS WITH DIFFERENT LEVELS OF. EXPERTISE AND CORE SERVICE PROVISION AND I THINK IMPORTANTLY WHERE THIS PERSON WOULD ADD- IMPORTANT- CONTRIBUTIONS WOULD BE. COORDINATING WITH LOCAL PARTNERS ON THE DISTRIBUTION OF FUNDS IN CONCERT AND IN COLLABORATION WITH WITH STATE AGENCY PARTNERS. FOR THANK YOU FOR THAT I ONE M. I HAVE ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS BUT I WANT TO MAKE SURE THEY GIVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO THE MEMBERS OF THE DIGEST DOESN'T QUICKLY I'M- I'M HAVING A HARD TO I'M- I'M NOT. TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WHAT IS BEEN THE FOCUS OF THE STATE FUNDED TRADE MISSIONS. YES THANK YOU FOR THAT THE QUESTIONS ARE SO- WE STRONGLY BELIEVE. THAT I. ARE KEY LIE. IN REVENUES THIS IS SOMETHING THAT MY TEAM HAS EXPERTISE IN- WE PROVIDE A SUPPORT FOR SMALL BUSINESSES ACROSS THE STATE SO THEY CAN TAP INTO THAT 95% OF CONSUMERS THAT WE KNOW ARE NOT IN THE UNITED STATES. SO TRADE MISSIONS ARE REALLY GEARED TOWARD PROVIDING THOSE TRANSACTIONAL COMMERCIAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR SMALL BUSINESSES- THAT MIGHT NOT OTHERWISE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE ON THAT. ABOUT GLOBAL ENGAGEMENT AND WE'VE REALLY PROVIDE THAT THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM TO ENGAGE DIRECTLY WITH THOSE BUYERS. WE DO SO HAND IN HAND WITH THE U. S. COMMERCIAL SERVICE- AND OTHER PARTNERS TO HELP US TO IDENTIFY. OVERSEAS OPPORTUNITIES SO FOR EXAMPLE IN THE PAST YEAR AND A HALF MY TEAM IS PUT TOGETHER TEN. TRADE MISSIONS FOR MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED SMALL BUSINESSES- WE PROVIDED A SMALL BUSINESSES OPPORTUNITIES FOR FOREIGN PROCUREMENT CONTRACTS FOR YOU KNOW NEW BUSINESS VENTURES TO SELL THEIR PRODUCTS AND THEIR SERVICES OVERSEAS. SO THE TRADE MISSION ASPECT IS REALLY A WAY FOR US TO HELP. MITIGATE THE RISK OF THOSE SMALL BUSINESSES AS THEY TAKE ON THAT NEW OPPORTUNITY. MY TEAM IS A MEMBER OF THE STATE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ORGANIZATION RECITAL. BUT THE NATIONAL ARM THAT THAT BRINGS TOGETHER ME AND MY COUNTERPARTS. 88% OF THEIR MEMBERS OR THIRTY SIX U. S. STATES SUPPORT TRADE. MISSIONS FOR SMALL BUSINESSES. MY UP MY CONCERN IT'S NOT A HUGE BECAUSE IT'S NOT A HUGE OF MONEY IT IS A- AMOUNT. IS THAT- I AND- I'M BELIEVING THAT OF THE US SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION WHICH IS FEDERAL MONEY. AS PRIMARILY THE SUPPORTER OF SUCH A PROGRAM IS THERE TRULY A NEED FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDING. I APPRECIATE THAT QUESTION ASSEMBLYMEMBER LACKEY- I WOULD SAY YES- BECAUSE CALIFORNIA IS SO LARGE MYTEAM DOES WORK ON THAT SB A PROGRAM THE STATE TRADE EXPANSION PROGRAM THAT YOU REFERENCE- AT THIS POINT THE GRANT IS DOES NOT MEET THE DEMANDS OF THE FOUR POINT FIVE MILLION SMALL BUSINESSES THAT OPERATE IN OUR STATE. SO WE FEEL CONFIDENT THAT THE ADDITIONAL- ALBEIT SMALL AMOUNT OF GENERAL FUNDS WITH SUPPLEMENT AND MEET THAT DEMAND THAT OUR SMALL BUSINESS COMMUNITY IS REALLY PRESENTING AND WOULD REALLY SERVE TO AUGMENT- THIS FEDERAL FUNDS THAT WE ALSO EFFECTIVELY DEPLOY. AND MATHIS AYE THOSE THOSE BUSINESS THERE'S OF RIGHT NOW- WOULD RESULT WITH REGARD TO THE TRADE PARTNERSHIP ARE THE IMMIGRANT. WE WORK WITH BUSINESS NOT BUSINESSES OF ALL TYPES I MEAN WE SIR- PRAYER WOMEN AND BETTER AND MINORITY- OWNED BUSINESSES- SO WE WOULD WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE PROVIDING THIS OPPORTUNITY TO UNDERSERVED BUSINESSES ACROSS THE STATE. THAT DOESN'T ANSWER MY QUESTION ARE THEY IMMIGRANT BUSINESSES. YES MA'AM THERE ARE IMMIGRANT THEIR IMMIGRANT BUSINESSES ARE INCLUDED IN IN OUR SERVICES AND OUR PROGRAMS WE DON'T HAVE EXACT DATA TO TELL YOU HOW MANY. BUT YES. WHEN CAN YOU PROVIDE THAT DATA SO THAT WE HAVE A PERCENTAGE AS TO WHICH HOW MANY OF THESE SMALL BUSINESSES ARE ACTUALLY IMMIGRANT OWNED BUSINESSES. I CAN FOLLOW UP WITH YOU AND SEE HOW WE CAN PROVIDE THE INFORMATION FOR YOU. OKAY CAN WE HAVE A TIME LINE AS TOWHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE OR WOULD YOU BE REACHING OUT TO COMMITTEE STAFF AND THEN DETERMINE THE TURNING THAT. I WOULD BE REACHING OUT TO COMMITTEE STAFF TO DETERMINE THAT MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU- MEXICO TO YOUR POINT ABOUT TRADES MEXICO IS CONSISTENTLY ONE OF CALIFORNIA'S TOP TRADING PARTNERS A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND ONGOING. GENERAL FUNDS. A SEEM IN SOME FISH INSUFFICIENT TO ENHANCE THE BORDER REGION ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES AND GROWING. BILATERAL TRADE AND INVESTMENTS BETWEEN CALIFORNIA AND MEXICO HOW DID GO VISIT TURMAN THE SCOPE AND FUNDING FOR THESE ACTIVITIES AND THOSE GO BIZ. BELIEVE THAT THIS FUNDING LEVEL IS SUFFICIENT. TO ADDRESS THE PRIORITIES. ALREADY APPROVED BY THE LEGISLATURE WE HAVE S. B. SIX EIGHTY FOUR- BY SENATOR WEST SO IN SB FIVE FIVE EIGHT ALSO BY SENATOR. WAS SO WHICH- PAST THAT IN THE LEGISLATURE BUT WAS VETOED IN TWENTY NINETEEN. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AYE AYE THAT FUNDING THAT WE'VE REQUESTED FOR IT THESE TRADE MISSIONS BUT I THINK SPEAKS TO SEVERAL THINGS- HAVING DONE TEN- TRADE MISSIONS THIS PAST YEAR AND A HALF THAT HAVE BEEN. BOB RITUAL WE KNOW THE APPROXIMATE COST OF EXECUTING THESE TRADE MISSIONS SO THIS HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND WOULD ALLOW US THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXECUTE BETWEEN FOUR AND FIVE TRADE MISSIONS SUCH BASED ON NOT ON THE DATA. OF THE TRADE MISSIONS THAT WE'VE ALREADY PROVIDED FOR THE PAST YEAR AND A HALF- SO YOU KNOW WE REALLY SEE THIS AND I THINK THAT'S ALSO CONNECTS TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER LACKEYS QUESTION. THIS WOULD BE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US DEPARTMENT FEDERAL FUNDS FOR PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT TRADE PARTNER AND TO REALLY PROMOTE THE CROSS BORDER ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT THAT WE ARE ON VERY MUCH COMMITTED TO WITH OUR MOST IMPORTANT TRADE PARTNER. OKAY WELL WE'LL FOLLOW UP ON THIS ONE AS WELL IN TERMS OF NOT SURE I GOT THE ANSWER AS TO. HOW GO BIZ- BELIEVE THAT IF THE SPENDING A SUFFICIENT. TO DETERMINE THESE GOALS. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THAT THAT HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND WOULD ALLOW US TO COMPLETE FOUR TO FIVE TRADE MISSIONS- OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT YEAR SHOULD THE FUNDING BE APPROVED- YOU KNOW AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT OUR TEAM HAS THE CAPACITY TO DELIVER ON WITH HER PARTNERS- SO FROM A STAFFING PERSPECTIVE WE KNOW THAT IT TAKES QUITE A BIT OF WORK TO EXECUTE THESE TRADE MISSIONS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE- A BENEFIT. AND GOOD USE OF THE SMALL BUSINESS TIME THAT WE ASKED TO PARTICIPATE IN THEM SO EXECUTING FORTIFIED TRADE MISSIONS WITH THIS FUNDING IN ADDITION TO THE REST OF THE PLANS THAT WE HAVE FOR THE COURSE OF THE YEAR- IS BASED ON THAT THE COST OF WHAT WE KNOW THESE TRADE MISSIONS HAVE BEEN IN THE PAST AND ALSO THE CAPACITY OF US TO DELIVER ON THESE FORTY FIVE TRADE MISSIONS IN ADDITION TO OUR OTHER PRIORITIES FOR THE YEAR. OKAY THANK YOU FOR THAT- BEFORE WITH A MOVE ON TO THE NEXT- PANEL. ON ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT I JUST WANT TO STRESS THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE AVAILABLE SOONER RATHER THAN LATER. THERE ARE SOME PRIORITIES THAT I'M THINKING ABOUT WHEN LOOKING AT THIS PROGRAM. ABSENT TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE I CAN'T DETERMINE I'M NOT SURE MY COLLEAGUES CAN EITHER. GIVE THESE PRIORITIES- WILL BE MET- I'LL JUST LAY SOME OF THESE OUT. SOME OF THESE PRIORITIES INCLUDE BILL BUILDING OUT KEY STAFF WITHIN GO BIZ TO SUPPORT STATEWIDE COORDINATION AND IMPORTANCE. FIRST THEY LET CALIFORNIA HOME TO THE LARGEST POPULATION OF IMMIGRANTS INCLUDING THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN. RESIDENTS FOR YEARS OR DECADES. THIS POSITION WILL BE A KEY PARTNER IN CONVENING. ACROSS AGENCIES TO ENSURE SUCCESS OF THESE PROGRAMS AND COMMUNITIES. ADDITIONALLY FOCUSING ON ENGLISH LANGUAGE TRAINING LANGUAGE ACCESS OVERALL AND RESOURCES RELATED TO CITIZENSHIP WOULD BE HELPFUL TO WORK- CALIFORNIA HAS ALREADY INTO THE WORK THAT CALIFORNIA'S ALREADY INVESTED IN. ACROSS DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES ESPECIALLY THOSE AIMED AT LEGAL SERVICES. AND LASTLY PROVIDING GRANT MONEY FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO CREATE OR FURTHER THEIR OWN. IMMIGRANT INTEGRATION WORK WITH LOCAL WITH A LOCAL LANDS. AT IS A VERY. IMPORTANT AND CRITICAL COMPONENT. NOT EVERY CITY OR COUNTY INVEST IN THIS WORK. OR HAS THE RESOURCES TO INVEST IN THE SAME WAY THESE DOLLARS HELP CREATE. BRIDGES TO THIS WORK THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA LEVELS THAT. FITS THE SPECIFICS OF A LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND SO AGAIN I WANT TO STRESS THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING. TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE US SOONER RATHER THAN LATER. THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH OF THERE ARE NO ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS WE CAN A LOT. OKAY THANK YOU SO MUCH WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER FOUR- ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT- MISS GRAY ARE YOU ON THE LINE. YES I AM NOT A CHANCE OKAY LET'S BEGIN LARGE A PROPOSAL TO RETELL CRAFT HELLO WE ARE REQUESTING TWENTY MILLION- THAT FOR A GRANT PROGRAM FOR SMALL BUSINESSES A WE HAVE BEEN WORKING CLOSELY WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT AND RETAIL TO DEVELOP THIS PROGRAM WE ANTICIPATE THAT THE PROGRAM WOULD SIMPLY COMPENSATE SMALL BUSINESSES FOR PROPERTY LOSSES AS A RESULT CRYING. OUT WE HOPE TO HAVE TRAILER BILL- LANGUAGE AVAILABLE I THE NEXT FEW WEEKS. THANK YOU I'LL LET SOMEONE OPEN IT UP BOB BEFORE WE ACTUALLY GO TO THE DIS- ANY. MISTER WEATHERFORD FROM THE ALEJO'S OFFICE ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS THIS PROPOSAL IS PART OF A LARGER ORGANIZED RETAIL PACKAGE THAT YOU SHOULD CONSIDER WHETHER THE GOAL OF THIS PROPOSAL IS CONSISTENT WITH THE LEGISLATURE'S BROADER PUBLIC SAFETY GOALS SO FOR EXAMPLE THIS PROPOSALS INTENDED TO PROVIDE VICTIM COMPENSATION AND DOESN'T DIRECTLY ADDRESS PUBLIC SAFETY. SO AS YOU IN THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDER HOW TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM OF ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT TO WANT TO CONSIDER WHETHER THE GOALS OF THIS PROPOSAL OUR ENVIRONMENT WITH YOUR PARTICLES. AND THEN GETTING TO THE DETAILS OF THIS PROPOSAL THERE'S- NOT A LOT OF- DETAILS ACTUALLY. BUT KNOW IF THERE'S NUMBER OF PRESS CAN. THAT COULD MAKE ESTABLISHING PROPOSED PROGRAM QUITE CHALLENGING. AND- WE THOSE ARE THOSE THE MOST IN YOUR AGENDA- BUT WE'RE TO DISCUSS THE FOR THE PEOPLE. THANK YOU IS THERE. ANY COMMONER FINANCE NOTHING I HAD. THANK YOU I'M ACTUALLY REALLY EXCITED THAT WE HAVE TO FORMER LAW ENFORCEMENT. OFFICERS HERE ON THE DIETS AND WANT TO OPEN IT UP TO YOU AS WELL TO ANY QUESTIONS MISTER MISTER COOPER SURE THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND I DELEON SOME COMMENTS SEVERAL PRACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS MUST BE ADDRESSED MONEY WHO THEY GO TO WE TALK ABOUT SMASHING GRABBED THE CALL THE SMASH AND GRABS MOST OF THOSE HAVE BEEN A HIGH END RETAILERS LEAVE A TOTS BURBERRY I MEAN THE BIG HIGH END RETAILERS BUT TALK ABOUT SMALL BUSINESS SO THERE'S A DISCONNECT BETWEEN WHAT A SMALL BUSINESS IN THE HIGH END RETAILERS WHO'S ELIGIBLE WHAT DO YOU PROVE WHAT DO YOU DO. THIS WAS A BIG CONCERN DOES GO BIZ REALLY HAVE THE INSTITUTIONAL EXPERIENCE. A INCLUDING A PROGRAM LIKE THIS AND THAT'S FROM THE BIG CONCERNS WHAT'S L. ELIGIBILITY SO JUST TO WHOLE MYRIAD OF ISSUES. AND EVEN THOUGH THE SMASH AND GRAB HAVE GOTTEN. THE MAJORITY OF THE- ATTENTION ATTENTION PICKING MEASURE ATTENTION- THOSE FOLKS HAVE INSURANCE SO WHEN I THINK SMALL BIZ LIKE MOM AND POP SHOPS A SMALL CORNER MARKET IN A NEIGHBORHOOD WHERE SOMEBODY WALKS IN THERE AND GRABS UP HANDS FULL AMPLE THE FOOD OR ALCOHOL AND WALKS OUT THEY CAN'T REPLACE THAT THOSE ONES ARE TRULY BEING IMPACTED THE MOST. YOU KNOW WE WE'VE SEEN FOLKS WHAT RABBI IN THE CVS OR WALGREENS AND HAVE A BIG PLASTIC TRASH BAGS LOADED UP AND WRITE OUT A THERE ARE A LOT OF- BALLS IN THE AIR ON THIS AND REALLY THE GOVERNOR'S FOR A LOT OF MONEY TOWARDS THIS- FILING THE MONEY'S GOING TOWARDS LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT. BUT THE BIG ISSUE IS THE LAW IS THE LAW IT HAS NOT CHANGED FOR RETAIL ORGANIZED CRIME TO REALLY DEAL WITH THIS AND THINK ABOUT THIS HE BUILT ON A LOT OF MONEY AT IT- IF I THINK TO MAKE EVERYBODY FEEL GOOD BUT TO REST SOMEONE FOR ORGANIZED RETAIL CRIME AND CHARGE THEM. YES BEYOND THE THIRD CONVICTION YOU HAVE TO PROVE THAT IT WAS FOR THE PURPOSES OF RESELL SO SOMEONE HAS TO ADMIT THEY'RE GONNA RESELL THAT PROPERTY NUMBER ONE AND NUMBER TWO IF TO PROVE CONSPIRACY NO ONE EVER PROVED CONSPIRACY ON STAFFS- THINK ABOUT THAT WITH NEW CHARGES PERCY ON SOMEONE TO BE FOR THE MURDER CASE WE HAVE SOMEONE ON TAPE RECORDING TYPE RECORDING. A THING THEY'RE DOING THAT SO IT'S VERY VERY HARD TO CHARGE IF YOU LOOK AT THIS LAWS. BEEN EFFECT FOR TWO YEARS NOW. LOOK AT THE NUMBER OF A- ACTUALLY CHARGED IMPROV. OF THE RETAIL FOR CRIME LAW. WE DID SOME P. R. A. IT IS VERY. BECAUSE THIS MUCH THE- MOST U. DA LECTURE. BECAUSE TO HARD TO PROVE IN THAT CRIME SO- JUST FOR GOBIZ I GUESS I MEAN. YOU GUYS DON'T HAVE THE EXPERTISE AND- YOU KNOW ASK THIS QUESTION LAST WEEK WHEN WE HAD HE FULL BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE- YES FULL BUDGET HEARING. AND WE STILL KNOW THE DEFINITION OF A SMALL BUSINESS SO I MEAN. TO ME A LOT OF QUESTIONS THAT. NEED TO BE ANSWERED. BEFORE THIS PROGRAM GIVE. IN LET'S BE HONEST THAT THE BID FOLKS LIKE. SOME DARK WALMART WITH FOLKS- GONNA FIGURE OUT PUTS INTO TO GET THE MONEY. IT'S GOT BE SMALL BUSINESS BUT WE THOUGHT NO DEFINITE OF SMALL. SO HOW YOU GONNA DO AGO. DURING THE GROUND HERE- DO YOU POINT- AS THE MEMBER COOPER THE LARGE RETAILERS I'M WHICH HAVE BEENIN THE- HAVE A SIGNIFICANT ISSUE WITH THE RETAIL- BUT THE PROBLEM IS AS- FOR SMALL BIZ THAT AND ON THE ON THE A WEST A THOSE BUSINESS VERY WELL- FOR THE PURPOSES THIS. WE ARE LOOK AT SMALL TELL OUT- WITH FIGHTING% I'M IN WE FRANK WANT DO WITH THAT I THAT SOME ONE STAND CAN IN DISTRESS. THAT A AND FOR RIPE FOR THEFT IN DAMAGE- TO SMALLER AS TO OUR TRYING IN. ON THAT WE'RE THERE ARE NAY MARGINAL AND- DO PROPERTY- IF FAST AND DO ARE NOT INSURED MOST OF OUR LARGE TELL ST ARE IT STILL BEAT THOSE LOS. SO I'M TO YOUR TO WRAP QUESTION ABOUT THE SIZE OF SMALL BUSINESS WE ARE TURKEY THOSE UNDER MILLION. I IN IN REVENUE. OKAY THAT THAT THAT'S A NUMBER OF IT IS THERE A LAWLESS GOING ON RIGHT NOW FOCUS KNOW THEIR TO GO TO JAIL THE WAY THE RICH UNDER PROP FORTY- THE MO OF HIS. MOSTLY STORES HAVE A NON- CAN CONFRONTATION POLICY THAT IF SOME. STILL RESTORE THEIR- THE ORDER EMPLOYEES NOW TO CONFIRM THEM SO- ALLOW OF THESE FOLKS OUT THERE. THESE BE ORGANIZE JUST. IN JOE BLOW NO THERE NO COST. AS A RESULT OF MORAL. SO IT THAT. IS OUT THERE YEAH I SEE THAT A NUMBER OF FRONTS SO. MOST OF THE REALIZE WE HAVE THAT FACT TOO. SO THANK YOU. INTERSTATE THANK YOU. THE SELECTED YEAH THANK YOU ARE I DO SHARE SOME THE KANNST OF MY COLLEAGUES ON MEMBER KIRK COOPER ARE TAKE. BUT I WANT YOU KNOW AND I'M THANKFULLY BE TALK ABOUT THIS VERY PROBLEM. AND SO I COMMEND- THE EFFORT HOWEVER I DO HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF CONCERN. TO THAT THE ISN'T IT POSSIBLE THAT APPROPRIATING FUNDS TOWARDS A- GOAL BUSINESS EFFORTS MAY JEOPARDIZE. EFFORTS THAT MAY OTHERWISE BE ABLE TO LEVERAGE- MATCHING FUNDS LIKE FROM. THE A NATIONALLY SIGNIFICANT FREIGHT IN HIGHWAY PROJECT OR THE NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. THAT WOULD BE MY QUESTION. I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH THOSE PROGRAM SIR. MAY I COULDN'T COMMENT ON COMPARISON. OKAY IT SEEMS TO ME LIKE. WE COULD THE WHAT WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY IS THAT IT SEEMS LIKE WE WOULD MAXIMIZE OUR FUNDING IF WE ARE ABLE TO- JOINT ARMS- WITH SOME OF THESE FEDERAL PROJECTS BETTER ADDRESSING ON THIS THAT PROBLEM AS OPPOSED TO JUST- HANDING IT TO YOU FOLKS TO TRY TO TACKLE. THAT'S MY POINT. I UNDERSTAND. THANK YOU ABSENT TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THE QUESTIONS I HAVE A IS WHICH BUSINESS WOULD BE ELIGIBLE VERY SIMILAR TO MR COOPER AND TO MISTER LACK IS CONCERNED HOW WILL GO BIZ VERIFYING ELIGIBILITY AND ULTIMATELY WHAT IS THE ROLE OF INSURANCE COMPANIES AND Y. SCOPE IS WANTING TO INTERVENE IN THIS PROCESS. SHARE THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE IT IS BRAND NEW. I AM VERY COMPLEX BY NATURE. OUR DESIRE IS TO JUST TO ENSURE THAT AS WE STAND UP THIS PROGRAM IS THAT WE ENSURE THAT THE STATE DOLLARS FOR SPENT WHILE. WE ARE WORKING WITH AN INDUSTRY EXPERTS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT. I'M TAKE ANALYZE SOME OF VERY THINGS THAT YOU JUST MENTIONED AND WE ARE HOPEFUL I'M TO HAVE THE CHECK THE LINK WHICH APPEARS. OKAY I THINK WHAT YOU'RE ARE JUST CHEN KIND IN TERMS OF ESTABLISHING A THIS PROCESS THROUGH GOBIZ AND WHAT WILL BE. A GENERALLY YOUR ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS AND GOALS AND MEASUREMENTS OF SUCCESS. WHICH BUSINESSES WOULD BEING IMPACTED VERSUS- ESPECIALLY PRIMARILY THE ONES THAT HAVE GOTTEN IT TO MR COOPER POINT MR COOPER'S POINT. LARGE ATTENTION VERSUS SOME OF THE SMALLER MICRO BUSINESSES THAT DON'T RECEIVE THE SAME TYPE OF ATTENTION AND ULTIMATELY WHAT WILL BE THE OUT REACH PROGRAM. AND VERY SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS PANEL THAT WE HAD ON SMALL BUSINESSES WE WERE JUST DEFINITELY VERY CONCERNED ABOUT OUTREACH AND ENSURING THAT IT'S NOT JUST BIG RETAILERS THAT ULTIMATELY HAVE A SAFETY NET BUT THERE WERE ALSO PROVIDING. SMALL BUSINESSES THAT ARE ACTUALLY SUFFERING ADDITIONAL RESOURCES AS WELL NOT QUITE SURE I'VE WE'VE HEARD- ANSWERS TO THAT. YES MADAM CHAIR. I DO WANT TO REITERATE. THAT OUR FOCUS ON AND I DO BELIEVE- WE HAVE THE EXPERTISE AND THE NETWORK TO SUPPORT DEPLOYMENT TO SMALL BUSINESSES- FOR LOSSES I'M FOR COMPENSATION FOR ASSISTANCE. THROUGH OUR NETWORK AND WE WOULD BE MORE THAN HAPPY- TO ENGAGE WALL IN THE PROCESS AS WE- DEFINE I JUST PROGRAM. I WE ARE LOOKING AT- THAT INCLUDES SOME OF WHAT YOU HAVE MENTIONED INSURANCE PROOF OF LOST. YOU KNOW I'M GLAD NIGHT MEDICATION MEASURE TO ATHLETES REPORTING I MEAN WE ARE LOW AT OF THOSE BEING. I'M A AND LIE WAYS ME. THAT SMALLEST AND RETAILERS A SAFETY. THANK YOU I'M MISS GRAY WELL TO YOUR OSITION. AND HERE FIRST BY HEARING- TODAY'S ALSO. THE DEADLINE FOR TRADE BILL. AND WE'VE HEARD IN THE MOLD FRESH NOW THAT IS NO TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE FOR A LAW OF THESE PROPOSAL. AND GIVEN THAT IT TODAY IS OUR DEADLINE. WHEN DO YOU THINK WE COULD EXPECT THAT SO THAT THE LEGISLATURE CAN MAKE A MORE INFORMED DECISION. I THINK TWO WEEKS IS REALISTIC- WE ARE ENGAGED IN RESEARCH ON THAT BUT IF WE WERE ABLE TO- IN. THAT OR UP THAT CAN'T. WE CERTAIN WELL. OKAY THAT GIVES US AND- WE'RE GONNA BE BEHIND SINCE BUDGET TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE IS DEADLINE FOR TODAY- IT PUTS US IN A VERY DIFFICULT POSITION TO BE SUPPORTIVE OF MEASURES WHEN WE DON'T HAVE LANGUAGE. SO I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT'S ON YOUR RADAR. YES MA'AM OKAY INTERESTING. THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH AND AGAIN WELCOME. WE'RE GOING TO GO ON TO OUR OUR NEXT PANEL WHICH IS THEM ISSUE NUMBER FIVE THE SUPPLY CHAIN RESILIENCE WE'RE GOING TO GO AGAIN TO MISS OUT OF SILICON POWER MERECE. AND GOOD AFTERNOON ONCE AGAIN MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS- AGAIN OUT OF FIFTY COME OUT I MEAN IT'S A FEW DIFFERENT DIRECTOR HERE GO BAD. I SUPPLY CHAIN JUST. IS A STATE WIDE AND NATIONAL ISSUE CALIFORNIA IS HOME TO THREE OF THE LARGEST CARGO PORT IN THE COUNTRY. OUR TWO LARGEST PORTS IN LA AND LONG BEACH HANDLE 40% IMPORTANT 30% OF THE NATION'S EXPORTS AB RESPECTIVELY. OUR PORTS ARE EXPERIENCINGMAJOR DISTRIBUTION CHALLENGES SUCH AS OVERCROWDING OF CONTAINERS AT PORT TERMINALS SHORTAGE OF EQUIPMENT SUCH AS CHAFF EVEN CONTAINERS AND HISTORIC BACKLOG OF CARGO VESSELS AT ANCHOR WAITING FOR BIRTH SPACE. IN ADDITION TRUCK DRIVERS HAVE BASED ON CERTAIN KEY INCLUDING A LACK OF DETAILED CARGO CONTAINER PICKUP SCHEDULES. BESAL BELIEVES CANCELLATION AND- UNCLEAR DELIVERY DESTINATIONS. THINGS HAPPENING WITH THAT RAILROAD OPERATORS- THESE MAJOR SUPPLY CHAIN PROBLEMS ARE HINDERING THE MOVEMENT OF BUT IT'S LEADING TO INCREASED COSTS FOR CONSUMERS AND BUSINESSES. AND CREATING NEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT. NOW FROM THE ONSET OF THE PANDEMIC GOBIZ WORK CLOSELY WITH OUR COLLEAGUES ACROSS STATE GOVERNMENT TO UNDERSTAND THE NEEDS OF. OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM ESSENTIAL WORKERS GIVING THEM CRITICAL SUPPORT BY. MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE GETTING P. P. E. EQUIPMENT WITH CENTRAL WORKERS- A LOT OF THIS WORK WITH LED BY OUR DIRECTOR SUSTAINABLE FREIGHT DEVELOPMENT HERE COPAYS- BUT AS THE SUPPLY CHAIN CONCERNS CONTINUE TO EXPAND WE LOOKED FOR ADDITIONAL STEPS WE COULD TAKE. AND IT WAS CRITICAL TO BRING TOGETHER THE DIVERSE NETWORK OF SUPPLY CAIN STAKEHOLDERS. TO DISCUSS KEY CHALLENGES AND FIND CREATIVE SOLUTIONS. SO THIS PAST SEPTEMBER WE PARTNERED WITH CAL STAR. ORDERED LONG BEACH IS CSU LONG BEACH TO CREATE BE CALIFORNIA'S SUPPLY CHAIN SIX DEFINITION. SO KEY ELEMENTS OF THAT INCLUDED A SOCIAL MEDIA CAMPAIGN A VIRTUAL WORKSHOPS. AND IN PERSON SUMMIT WE HAVE A REPORT THAT WILL BE AVAILABLE THIS MONTH- WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF THAT. ACTUALLY FINALIZING THAT REPORT- THIS WEEK SO THAT WILL BE FOR. AND I CAN BE REAL MAKE THAT STAKEHOLDERS AGREED ON A SET OF SHORT LONGER. STEPS INCLUDING. CREATING TEMPORARY STORAGE FOR. INCREASING ACCESS TO TOP. TRANSITIONING PLAYERS IN THE CHAIN TO TWENTY FOUR SEVEN OPERATIONS AND REALLY COLLECTING AND SHARING DATA. MORE EFFICIENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY I'M AS WELL AS INVESTING IN INFRASTRUCTURE TO INCREASE CAPACITY AND RESILIENCE. NOW IN OCTOBER THE GOVERNOR ISSUED EXECUTIVE ORDER IN NINETEEN TWENTY ONE. WHICH DIRECTED STATE AGENCIES TO IDENTIFY ADDITIONAL WAYS TO ALLEVIATE CONGESTION AT CALIFORNIA PORTS AND EXPANDED EFFORTS TO EASE SUPPLY CHAIN ISSUES. BY ENGAGING STAKEHOLDERS TO DISCUSS THESE CHALLENGES. GO BUSINESS TAX WITH ISSUE IN OUR IN OUR- AND ALONG WITH CALL AT TGS WE TRYING TO STATE OWNED PROPERTY. AND PARCEL. THAT CAN BE MADE ME LIVING TO ADDRESS SHORT TERM CARGO CONTAINERS. NEEDS WE'VE ALSO BEEN WORKING WITH OUR PRIVATE PARTNERS AND T. P. O.'S OR THIRD PARTY OPERATORS IO ALSO CREATED AN INTERAGENCY SUPPLY CHAIN TASK FORCE WHICH ARE DIRECTOR GO BATES CHAIRS TO IMPLEMENT THE GOALS AND VIDEO AND IDENTIFY OTHERS POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS. BRIEFLY A FEW OTHER THINGS THAT THE STATE HAS DONE IN THE ISSUANCE OF THE EO. BACK IN NOVEMBER CALTRANS BEGAN ISSUING TEMPORARY PERMITS ALLOWING TRUCKS TO CARRY INCREASED WEIGHT OF UP TO EIGHTY THOUSAND POUNDS ON STATE HIGHWAY TO HELP WITH THAT. MOVEMENT OF GOODS WE ALSO NEARLY DOUBLED THE DMV'S CAPACITY TO CONDUCT COMMERCIAL DRIVING TASKS. FOR OUR SHORTAGE OF WORKERS IN THE INDUSTRY AND THEN ALONG WITH OUR COLLEAGUES AT CVS. MORE RECENTLY WE'VE BEEN WORKING. WITH THE PORT OF OAKLAND AS WELL AS THE STAR EXPORTERS IN FINDING SPACE AND EVEN REALLY HAVING A HARD TIME GETTING A PRODUCT. OUT AND SENT BACK TO EVERYWHERE. ALL OVER THE WORLD- ONLY GROWERS AND WORK THAT TO. REALLY KIND HELPED HIM- EASE SOME OF THIS MOVIE- BUT WE KNOW MORE TO BE DONE. AND THE SUPPLY CHAIN REQUIRES TERM A INVESTING TO TRUE ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. SO TO THAT END GO VISITS AND PROCESS IMPROVEMENTS THE PORTS. TO ENABLE EFFICIENT CARGO MOVEMENT REDUCE CONGESTION AND CREATE OPPORTUNITIES TO INCREASE CARGO VOLUME BY PROMOTING AND BUILDING MUSICIANS HE'S- NOW WE KNOW THAT THE SUPPLY CHAIN ISSUES ARE A COMPLETE THE COMPLEX SYSTEM OF SYSTEMS. AND THERE'S A LACK OF CENTRALIZED DATA THAT IT CONTRIBUTES TO MUCH OF THE CONFUSION THAT I OUTLINED EARLIER- AS MUCH OF THIS OPERATION. AND SUPPORT THAT- THAT SPENDING BE CONTRIBUTED TOWARDS INCLUDING DATA SHARING ACCESS AND MODERNIZATION IN ORDER TO ENABLE REAL TIME SITUATIONAL UPDATES. INCREASED COMMUNICATION BETWEEN CARRIERS. OPTIMIZE SHIPMENT ROUTE AND ELIMINATE BLIND HAND. SO THE DATED MAY MORE CUTS AND IS MODERNIZE THE WITH THAT MANAGED AND MEMBERS HAPPY TO ANSWERING QUESTION. THANK YOU MISS CUMPLIR ROMERO LET'S HEAR FROM THE L. A. O. OFFICE BY THE DEPARTMENT OF. THE WE GO TO THE DICE. RIGHT YES BRING WITH OF THE LEGISLATIVE AND OFFICE. AND THAT'S THE PRAYER I THIS PER IS PART OF A- PACK THIS. PACKAGE. AND IT TURNED OUT THAT THE D. THE PER IS ON BEING TO. SO UNABLE TO EVALUATE THE MERITS PROPOSED WITHOUT INFORMATION ABOUT HOW THE PHONE WOULD BE ON THE YOU SO INDUSTRY TIMES YOU HE'S FUNDS TO IMPLEMENT DIRECTLY. PUT FORTH COMING FROM THE FEDERAL HURT COMMISSION PERTAINING TO THE- OF COMMON DATA STANDARDS. AMONG THE SHIPPERS. AND RAIL AND SO FORTH SO IMPROVE DID IN. HE CERTAINLY COULD OVER. ADDRESS SOME OF THE SUPPLIES PROBLEMS WE WOULD OBSERVE THERE'S NOT OBVIOUS ROLE FOR THE STATE IN THIS BECAUSE THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARIES A PRIVATE COMPANIES WITH CLEAR PRESS. TRUST IN ADOPTING IT IS STANDARDS AND- AND SO IT- WE KNOW THAT OTHER CITY. ALSO. IT EXPERTISE AND TECHNICAL GOODS MOVEMENT ISSUES. MISTER WEATHERFORD CAN YOU- YOU CAUGHT MY ATTENTION WITH THE BENEFICIARY BEING A PUBLIC COMPANY A PUBLIC COMPANY CAN YOU ELABORATE ON THAT A BIT. WELL ALL THE THAT THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARIES OF IMPROVING THE DIDN'T DROP. REALLY ARE. PUSHING CARRIERS WHICH- HERE OFTEN- EVERY TERMINAL OPERATORS WHICH ON THE SPACE FROM THE PORTS AND THE TRUCKERS AND THE RAILROAD IT'S A WHOLE. ABOUT IT DID YOU LEAVE ME. YES I'M SORRY CAN YOU CAN YOU BEGIN AGAIN YOU KIND OF YOU BURKE. DIGITIZED A BIT. GOOD QUITE THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION TO LET ME MAKE MY BROKEN BODY AND WITH THE LOW LET ME STOP MY VIDEO. PERFECT FOR IF YOU CAN BE FOUND WE WERE MAKING IS THAT- THE BENEFICIARIES OF THE DATA IT BEEN PROVING DATA. AVAILABILITY IS- IT'S PRIVATE OCEAN SHIPPERS RAILROADS TRUCKERS AND- SO FORTH AND SO WE'RE NOT CLEAR THERE'S A PUBLIC ROLE IN SUPPORTING THIS AND IF THERE IS A PUBLIC ROAD MIGHT BE MORE PERFECT IF FEDERAL. OF ROLE AS OPPOSED TO A STABLE. THANK YOU FOR THAT KIND DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. YOU TOMORROW JOHNSON DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE NOTHING TO ADD AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU I'M GONNA ASK FOR THE MEMBERS OF THE DIS IF THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS. WELL I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS A SAME AS PREVIOUS- ISSUES WHEN WITH THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE BE AVAILABLE FOR THIS PROPOSAL. I THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- WE ARE I'M IN THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING THAT AS WELL AND HOPING TO. COORDINATE WITH YOUR STAFF AND PROVIDE YOU WITH AN UPDATE- I'LL DEFER TO MY COLLEAGUE THAT FINANCE IF WE HAVE A- MORE SPECIFIC TIME FRAME. TOMORROW JOHNSON THE PARDON OF FINANCE- WE ARE WORKING TO THE LANGUAGE AND- INTEND TO HAVE OF THE LANGUAGE TO USE IN. THANK YOU AND I- MISS JOHNSON I HATE TO PUT YOU ON THE SPOT AGAIN BUT WHAT THE SOON MEAN WOULDN'T WHEN IS THAT A DATE FOR THAT EXACTLY SINCE DEADLINE WAS TODAY. YES MADAM CHAIR- WE ARE WORKING TO LANGUAGE AND WE INTEND TO- IT IS OUR GOAL TO HAVE THE LANGUAGE- POSTED BY THE END OF THIS WEEK. OKAY I ASK AGAIN BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE ARE THINKING ABOUT WHAT IS THE STATE ROLE IN COORDINATING AND HOW WHAT IS THE BALANCE OF HOW WE'RE SUPPOSED TO DO THIS WORK WITHOUT ANY TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE. AND THE LEGISLATURE MAKING A DECISION ON THE PROPOSAL. IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE GET THAT- AS SOON AS POSSIBLE TO THE QUESTION TO THE COMMENTS MADE BY MR WHETHER FOR WHAT IS THIS ROLE IN WITH THE FEDERAL ROLE AT AT THE PORTS. YEAH I THINK YOU MENTIONED THAT IS AN EXCELLENT POINT- MADE BY MISTER WEATHERFORD I THINK WHAT I WILL ADD IS THAT. THIS IS A AGAIN AS I MENTIONED A VERY COMPLEX- SYSTEM WHERE THERE REALLY IS NO ONE ENTITY THAT'S TASKED WITH OVERSEEING. THE VARIOUS MOVING PARTS. WE ARE WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH OUR COUNTERPARTS AT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT- FNC IN PARTICULAR THAT MARITIME COMMISSION AND- IS ALSO LOOKING AT THIS VERY VERY CLOSELY- IT REALLY IS TAKING. EVERYONE I THINK TO WORK COLLABORATIVELY TO COME UP WITH THE- MY SOLUTION AND- YOU KNOW MOVE THIS FORWARD BUT WORK BUT I CAN'T SAY IS AS FAR AS- THE STATE. INVOLVEMENT IS THAT- AS I MENTIONED IN MY COMMENTS EARLIER- YOU KNOW WHAT HAVING ISSUES WITH YOU KNOW GETTING P. P. E. EQUIPMENT TO- YOU KNOW ESSENTIAL WORKERS OR TWERK FRONTLINE WORKERS BECAUSE- ITEMS WERE JUST TAKING. YOU KNOW MONTHS TO ARRIVE YOU KNOW PROPER MATH. BETTER EQUIPMENT- I THINK THAT THAT DOES BECOME YOU KNOW A STATE ISSUE THAT THAT THE HEALTH AND SAFETY YOU KNOW OF OUR OF OUR- OF OUR FRONTLINE WORKERS- I ACT FOR INSTANCE I MENTIONED. EARLIER WE JUST WERE OVERWHELMED WITH HEARING FROM OUR AGRICULTURAL EXPORTERS. WHO JUST WERE NOT HAVING ANY LUCK BEING ABLE TO SEND. THEIR PRODUCTS- ABROAD OR TO WHOEVER THEY YOU KNOW THEY'RE THERE THEIR CLIENT IS- AND THAT DOES AFFECT US AS WELL BECAUSE IS YOU KNOW I'M THOSE PRODUCTS ESPECIALLY. OUT PRODUCTS HAVE A VERY SHORT SHELF LIFE. AND SO IF THOSE ARE ARE OUT AND SITTING. FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME THAT UNFORTUNATELY IS REALLY GOING TO IMPACT OUR OUR AG INDUSTRY- OUR GROWERS AND REALLY HAVE A TRICKLE DOWN EFFECT. AND SO- LITTLE BIT IS REALLY DONE- REALLY SINCE. THE ONSET OF- GO VISIT SECTION TO OUR OUR FREIGHT- POSITION. ANYMORE RECENTLY TO WITH A- ORDER AND SUCH. IS BECAUSE- A. COME V. OF SORTS YOU KNOW WE'VE WORKED WITH ALL STATE. FOR ACROSS THE FIGHT AND COME. TO REALLY YOU KNOW FOLKS TO THE TABLE AND FIGURE OUT. WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT WERE THAT ROOM IS FOR THE STATE TO YOU- TO WORK AND IN THIS CASE WE FEEL THAT. THAT THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS- WHILE WE'RE STILL DEVELOPING BEAT BEAT PROPOSAL AND SPECIFICALLY ON THE DATA SIDE. BILL THAT THERE DEFINITELY IS SOME ROOM THERE FOR US TO PROVIDE AN INCENTIVE. TO HELP- REALLY COORDINATE THIS THAT'S PROPOSAL. I THANK YOU FOR THAT THERE'S CURRENTLY A FREIGHT POSITION WITHIN GO BIZ THAT HAS BEEN VACANT HOW SOON WILL YOU BE HIRING A PERSON TO OVERSEE THAT THAT POSITION JUST BY THE GENTLEMEN- WHO HAD IT JUST RETIRED- AT THE END OF THIS LAST YEAR. AND SO WE HAVE- POSTED THE POSITION AND WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF- FINDING A CANDIDATE SO WE EXPECT TO HAVE HOPE WE HAVE THAT BILL WITHIN THE NEXT THIRTY DAYS OR SO. THAT'S GOOD TO KNOW. DOES THE ADMINISTRATION'S THIRTY MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND PROPOSAL FOR OPERATIONAL AND PROCESS IMPROVEMENTS AT THE PORT INCLUDE. B. TWENTY MILLION REQUESTS FROM THE PORT OF LOS ANGELES- FOR AN END TO END DIGITAL SOLUTION THAT SUPPORTS INTER OPERABILITY AND INTEGRATED DATA DATA SHARING ACROSS THE SUPPLY CHAIN. IF NOT AT ALL WHAT PORTIONS OF ANY ARE INCLUDED. YES THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION AND AGAIN GOING BACK TO SOME OF MY EARLIER COMMENT- WHAT WITH MADE IT CHALLENGING IS THAT REALLY MOST. OF US. STAKEHOLDERS NOT JUST SUPPORT THEMSELVES BUT OTHER SHIPPING LINES- YOU KNOW THE ENTIRE SPECTRUM- THEY EVERYONE HAVE THEIR OWN SYSTEM IN PLACE. THE PUBLIC IN PARTICULAR HAVE- MADE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS OVER THE YEARS INTO THEIR OWN SYSTEMS. AND THE CHALLENGES THAT BECAUSE THERE'S REALLY NO COMPATIBILITY THERE'S NO NO FLUIDITY- PER SE FOR- FOR THIS PROCESS- THAT'S REALLY MADE A VERY CHALLENGING AND SO. IF YOU ASK ME ONE PORTMAN OTHER EACH ONE. YOU KNOW HAVE THEIR OWN IDEA OF MAYBE WHAT MAKES SENSE- HOWEVER WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO TAKE A STEP BACK AND SEE IF THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO ALIGN. THE SYSTEMS- AND MOVED OUT SO NO. TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION I DON'T CARE THAT TWENTY MILLION AND IS NOT PART OF THIS PROPOSAL- AGAIN WE'RE TRYING TO FOCUS ON A BROADER APPROACH. THAT INCORPORATES ALL STAKEHOLDERS. UNDER ABROAD APPROACH TO. ALL STATE. WELL ALL STAKEHOLDERS USE DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGY SEEMS COMPLICATED. YEAH MMHM OKAY- ALGO BIZ ALSO PLAYS A ROLE IN THE STATE'S TRANSITION TO A CARBON NEUTRAL ECONOMY ESPECIALLY AS THESE ACTIVITIES RELATE TO THE STATE'S LOGISTICAL NETWORK DOES GO BIZ BELIEVE THAT IT HAS SUFFICIENT RESOURCES TO SUCCESSFULLY PLAY THIS ROLE. YES THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION- SO WE ARE GETTING TWO PRONG- ANSWER HERE SO WE ARE WORKING CLOSELY- OF COURSE WITH OUR COLLEAGUES AT CAL STYLE. AND IN THEIR EFFORTS ON THEIR FREIGHT MOBILITY PLAN THIS COMPILED THE COMPLETE YOU JUST RAISED AS PART OF THEIR THEIR MOBILITY PLAN AS WELL AND SO THERE IS AN ASPECT THERE AND THEN ON OUR END- WE DO HAVE. A TEAM- THAT HANDLES A LOT OF OUR- ZERO MISSION HOURS I'VE TEAM- ON STAFF IS ALSO VERY SUPPORTIVE- TO HELPING US ACCOMPLISH AS WELL SO WE DO FEEL THAT WE HAVE THE RESOURCES BOTH IN HOUSE AND THEN ALSO THROUGH OUR COLLABORATIVE EFFORTS WITH OUR OUR COLLEAGUES ARE NO ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS WE CAN MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT. WERE ON TOMORROW JOHNSON DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I WOULD JUST LIKE TO- CLARIFY ON ON THE LANGUAGE PIECE- WE- DID NOT PROPOSE A TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE BUT WE DO HAVE A BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE WE BELIEVE THAT THAT WAS THAT THAT IS SUFFICIENT TO- UP FOR THE OPERATIONS OF THE EVENT FUNDING THAT AS WELL THANK YOU MISS JOHNSON.

ON AND IF WE DESIRE TO DO SO- AS WE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE ONE I HAD HER WE WOULD LIKE TO ADD TO FUNDING FOR THE PROGRAM. THROUGH- HE ENTIRELY OF THE PARTY FOR YEARS AND FOUR YEARS I THE AND- WOULD LIKE TO. THE ENTREPRENEURSHIP FIND WHICH IS DESIGNED ARE DESIGNED TO ACCELERATE THE GROWTH OF SMALL BUSINESS PARTICIPANTS IN EACH OF THE REGIONAL AYE INCLUSIVE INNOVATION HOPS. I STATUS ON THE EXISTING PROGRAM. WHICH IS DESIGNED TO STIMULATE PARTNERSHIPS AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND JOB CREATION FOR UNDERSERVED GEOGRAPHIC AREAS INDUSTRY SECTORS AND BUSINESS OWNERS- WE HAVE BEEN THROUGH THE RFP SUBMISSION PROCESS FOR THAT FIRST ROUND TEN IT OPENED UP TO ELEVENTH I'M CLOSE DECEMBER SIXTEENTH. WE'VE RECEIVED TWENTY TWO APPLICATIONS AND ARE CURRENTLY GOING THROUGH THE COURT PROCESS. WE'LL TAKE QUESTIONS AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU LET'S HEAR FROM THE L. EIGHT OH PLEASE MISTER WHETHER FORD FOLLOWED BY- DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. MY BRAIN WHETHER FOR WITH LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND- WHAT ARE COMING FROM THIS IT'S A BIT DIFFICULT TO EVALUATE YOU KNOW THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSING HAVE MORE MONEY TO THE INCLUSIVE INNOVATION HUB PROGRAM. AND- THERE WAS PRETTY. PROGRAM BUT TO OUR KNOWLEDGE IT'S NEVER BEEN FULLY ON THE REALLY GOING TO TELL YOU WAITED SO WE DON'T KNOW. YOU KNOW WHERE THE OTHER- SOURCE THE FUNDING WERE COMING FROM YOU KNOW THE INITIAL THE PREVIOUS INNOVATION PROGRAM DIDN'T HAVE A LOT OF STATE FUNDS. SO- YOU KNOW WE DON'T KNOW A LOT ABOUT- THE ACTIVITIES I CAN IN A IN A WAY THAT WE CAN EAT ANALYZE AND EVALUATE AND SO. SECURITY ADMINISTRATION'S ASKING FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDS TO EXPAND EXTEND THE PROGRAM AND- IT'S JUST HARD TO EVALUATE IT SO- WEEK. YOUR RECORD WE ARE SUGGESTING THAT PERHAPS- ADDING SOME LANGUAGE ON TO THIS PROPOSALS AND YOU KNOW COULD BE DONE BY THE BILL- TO- TO REQUIRE THEM TO COLLECT. POINTS METRICS ON ABOUT THE AN INNOVATION HUB SO THAT WE CAN- I IN THE FUTURE HAVE SOME- EVIDENCE TO YOU KNOW INFORM ANY ADDITIONAL PROPOSED CHANGES TO THE PROGRAM. THANK YOU DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. NINE JOHNSON DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE NOTHING TO AT THIS TIME THANK YOU. THANK YOU TO THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE HAVE QUESTIONS MISTER LUCKY YEAH I JUST HAVE A SPECIFIC QUESTION AS IT RELATES TO THE- ENTREPRENEURSHIP FUND. HOW WILL THE FIRE SMALL BUSINESSES BE CHOSEN. AN EXCELLENT QUESTION ASSEMBLYMEMBER LACKEY ON THAT WE ARE PROPOSED TO CREATED AN ADVISORY COUNCIL AND TO LIFT AS SIGN A STAFF PERSON. I'M REALLY TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PROGRAM I'M WE KNOW FROM THE HISTORY OF THE PROGRAM THAT THE- THE- INTEREST IN THE PROGRAM. IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN BECAUSE IT DID NOT COME WITH FUNDING. AND WE BELIEVE THAT WE CAN SHORE UP AND CALIFORNIA'S COMPETITIVE THE ADS. WE DO INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY VERY WELL AND WE BELIEVE THAT THE INVESTMENT INVEST WILL HELP TO YOU I SEED AND ACCELERATE THE GROWTH OF THE SMALL BUSINESSES THAT PARTICIPATED IN THE PROGRAM. AND SELL ASSETS WE WILL STAND UP IN ADVISORY COUNCIL THAT WILL CONSIST OF REPRESENTATION FROM THE HUBS FROM THE REGIONS IN WHICH THE HUBS RESIDE. ON THE AND- STAFF INDUSTRY EXPERTS AND THEY WILL WEIGH IN ON THE APPLICATION PROCESS ADDITIONAL. ONLY THOSE BUSINESSES THAT HAVE BEEN IMPLICATED OR ACCELERATED AND HAVE AN EXISTING RELATIONSHIP WITH THE HELP THROUGH WHICH THEY APPLY WILL BE. ALLOWED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE FUNDING PROCESS I'LL LASTLY EACH OF THE HUBS WILL. HAVE FIVE. AND BUSINESSES THAT THEY ARE ALLOWED TO CELEBRATE EACH YEAR I'M. AT A AT A MAXIMUM. I THANK YOU I LAST YEAR CAN CHANGES WERE ENACTED FOR BOTH I HOPE TO ANSWER THIS PROPOSAL SEEMS TO MAKE ADDITIONAL CHANGES TO BOTH PROGRAMS WHY IS CARILLO IS BA PROPOSING ADDITIONAL CHANGES WITHOUT ANALYZING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF EITHER PROGRAM. IT IS NOT MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE LANGUAGE THAT WE WROTE IS MAKING CHANGES TO BOTH PROGRAMS. WE ARE ONLY SUGGESTING EIGHT CHANGE- IN OUR PROGRAM THE INCLUSIVE INNOVATION HUB PROGRAM- WE ARE LOOKING TO YOU I ATTY. ALIGN WITH AND LEVERAGE THE INVESTMENT OF THE COMMUNITY ECONOMIC RESILIENCE FINES AND WE BELIEVE THAT WE CAN SERVE THE GEOGRAPHIES AT THE STATE BETTER IF WE ALIGN WITH THE REGIONAL MAP THAT- THAT THEIR OVERSIGHT BODY HAS CREATED. I AM IN AND WE FEEL THAT IT'S NECESSARY TO DO SO TO GIVE. ESPECIALLY THOSE REGIONS WITHOUT RELYING GEOGRAPHIES I'M THE SAME OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THE REDUCE RESOURCES AS THOSE IN. MORE. DENSELY POPULATED AREAS. OKAY THE- THE PC PS FOUR FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND FOR AN ADDITIONAL FOUR ADMINISTRATIVE COST IS THIS IN ADDITION TO ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS ON TOP OF THE CURRENT I HOPE TO PROGRAM AND THE SURF PROGRAM AND WHAT IS THE TOTAL FOR ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS THAT WILL GO INTO THE THREE PROGRAMS. MADAM CHAIR I'M NOT. AWARE AS IT MINISTRY TO COST AND FORMER CANCER PROGRAM AGAIN WE HAVE THE ONLY PUT FORTH I'M COSTS RELATED TO OUR PROGRAM. AND TWO I ASM LACKEY'S SWEETS I THINK WE WANT TO- BE SURE THAT WE HAS THE OVERSIGHT AND MONITORING AND EVALUATION NECESSARY TO RUN IT THE- INNOVATION AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP PROGRAM. AT THIS PROPOSAL CONSISTS OF AND WE CANNOT DO SO WITHOUT ADDITIONAL SOURCES SO WE CAN'T DO THE BEST JOB. AND. WITHOUT ADDITIONAL RESOURCES. I'M MISS GREAT WHAT ARE THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS FOR THE I HOPE TO PROGRAM ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS. AND IN IN THE EXISTING AND BUDGET THAT WAS IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL. OKAY THANK YOU FOR THAT HOW WILL- ALWAYS BE A OVERSEE THAT I HAVE PROGRAM TO ENSURE HISTORICALLY UNDERSERVED BUSINESSES BE REACHED VERY SIMILAR TO QUESTIONS THAT WE HAVE HAD IN OTHER PANELS AT WHAT METRICS AND MEANT AND BENCHMARKS WILL BE USED TO TRACK SUCCESS. EXCELLENT AND AGAIN TRYING TO- ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE WANT THE ADMINISTRATIVE FINES IS SO THAT WE CAN DO THAT EXACT KIND OF THE IN DEPTH ANALYSIS DATA TRACKING. MONITORING AND EVALUATION OF THE PROGRAMS ABOUT WE DON'T. FEEL THAT WE CAN ENSURE THAT WE ARE HITTING THE GEOGRAPHIES AND THE UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES THAT WE YOUR DESIRE TO DO SO WITH THE PROGRAM UNLESS WE HAVE THE RESOURCES. TO DO THAT WE ARE KEEPING I'M TRYING READY TO UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES AND IT IS MEANT TO NOT ONLY REACH THOSE COMMUNITIES BUT TO REACH UNDER REPRESENTED AND UNDERSERVED. COUNTERS AS WELL. AND AS A FALL UP THE INITIAL AYE HERB PROGRAM FOCUSED ON INDUSTRY SECTORS AND WAS INTENDED TO BALANCE THE STATE'S EXISTING REGIONAL ECONOMIC. DEVELOPMENT FOCUS NOW THAT I HOMES HAVE NO SPECIFIC INDUSTRY FOCUS HOW WILL REGIONAL I HOPE DEMONSTRATE IT IS CAPABLE OF SUPPORTING ENTREPRENEURS IN EVERY INNOVATION TECH SECTOR. IF THEY ARE ALIGNING WITH OTHER PROGRAMS WHAT MAKES HIM A UNIQUE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROVIDER. AND I'M NOT SURE THAT I UNDERSTAND IT THE WE ARE ALIGNING WITH OTHER PROGRAMS WE ALIGNED WITH THE OTHER PROGRAMS IN ORDER TO LEVERAGE THIS STATE INVESTMENT ACT. I'M I'M I'M NOT SURE I'M GETTING THE- FULL CONTEXT OF THAT QUESTION. WELL IF YOU'RE IT'S IF YOU ARE COMBINING EFFORTS WITH OTHER PROGRAMS WHAT MAKES THE I HOPE PROGRAM UNIQUE. I'M SO I THINK THAT IT WOULD BE WRONG TO THAT WE ARE THIS WITH ANOTHER WE ARE NOT WE ARE SIMPLY TO ALIGN OUR R. SO THE IT WE CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE OTHER INVESTMENT AND WE'VE HOPE THAT ONCE- THE- ARE BETTER SERVED THROUGH THE SIR PROGRAM WOULD ALSO WANT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF- THAT KNOWLEDGE BASE THAT WERE. THE WORK THAT DOING IN THIS COMMUNITIES OUT WE THINK THAT IT JUST OFFERS OUR CONSTITUENCY ACROSS THE STATE A MORE ROBUST AND PROGRAM. WE DON'T WANT TO I WAS TRYING TO SAY WE DON'T WANT TO OPERATE IN A VACUUM I'M STILL THE THAT WOULD BE MY INITIAL RESPONSE TO THAT REGARDING THE INDUSTRY CLUSTERS WE ARE LOOKING TO HAVE THE INDUSTRY SPECIALIZATION IN TERMS OF TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION CLEAN TACK ON TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER SMALL BUSINESS INNOVATION RESEARCH WE ARE LOOKING TO CAPITALIZE AGAIN ON AS THEY SAID EARLIER ON CALIFORNIA'S. EDGE WE HAVE MORE I IN THE STATE WE ATTRACT MORE CAPITAL AND THE STATE THEN ALL OF THE OTHER STATES IN THE UNION TO WORK AND WE NEED TO DRAW ON TALENT FROM OTHER REGIONS TO SHORE UP WE'RE WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND WIDELY DISINVEST IT COMMUNITIES TO GIVE EVERYONE AN OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS PART OF OUR ECONOMY WE NEED AN ECONOMY THAT WORKS FOR US ALL. NOT AS THANKS SELECT FEW.

THESE GRANTS WILL INJECT FUNDS IN THE COUNTY LET PROJECTS THAT ARE AIMED AT PROCESS IMPROVEMENT ECONOMIC DIVERSIFICATION CLIMATE TECHNOLOGIES ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND JOB CREATION. AS THESE ECONOMIES GRAPPLE WITH THE IMPACT OF COVER NINETEEN AND CLIMATE CHANGE THESE GRANTS WILL OFFER FLEXIBILITY TO THE QUALIFIED COUNTIES ENABLING INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR FUTURE ECONOMIC RESILIENCE WITHOUT THE NEED TO REDUCE UNNECESSARY ALLOCATIONS. TO VITAL SERVICES FOR THE COMMUNITY OPPORTUNITY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS OF BETA LET'S GO TO THE L. A. O. FOLLOWED BY THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE MISTER WEATHERFORD. IT SEEMS MISTER WEATHERFORD MAY HAVE SOME TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES RIGHT NOW SO LET'S GO TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE MS JOHNSON TO ADD AT THIS TIME. BEFORE WE GET- DELHI OFFICE BACK ON THE LINE A MINUTE TURN IT OVER TO THE COMMITTEE ANY QUESTIONS. OKAY- MISTER PER- BUT A LOT CAN GO THIS PROVIDE EXAMPLES OF WHAT PROJECTS THEY BELIEVE WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR THIS FUNDING. YES THERE ARE CERTAIN TYPES OF PRODUCTS WITH COULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR THIS FUNDING IN SOME SENSE THEY COULD BE- PROJECTS RELATED TO INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE WORK FORCE TRAINING. OR OTHER ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PRIORITIES IT COULD BE USED FOR GRANTS SOLICITATION OR USE OF MATT AS MATCH FUNDS FOR FEDERAL GRANT OPPORTUNITIES WHERE THEY'RE LOCAL OR THEIR REVENUES DO NOT ALLOW FOR THEM TO ACTUALLY GO AND OBTAIN THOSE FEDERAL GRANTS. AS WELL AS SUPPLEMENTING ADDITIONAL PROGRAMS THAT MAY HAVE GAPS IN THEIR ADDITIONAL FUNDING SO FOR INSTANCE- SOMETHING THAT CONVENTION AND A COUPLE TIMES DURING THE HEARING IS THE SURF PROGRAM. THERE ARE CURRENTLY NO ALLOCATION OF SIX HUNDRED MILLION WHICH WOULD CAP THE NUMBER OF DOLLARS A TRIBUTE TO A SPECIFIC PROJECT. AT ROUGHLY FORTY SIX MILLION POTENTIALLY. IN WHICH CASE THE PROJECT THAT GOES OVER THAT AMOUNT AND IS QUALIFIED BY BOTH THAT COMMITTEE AS WELL AS THIS PROGRAM. COULD OBTAIN THE ADDITIONAL FUNDS NECESSARY TO BRIDGE THAT THAT SHORTFALL. AND OUR THEIR X. STAY PROGRAM THAT WOULD POSSIBLY FUND THESE PROJECTS. THERE ARE EXISTING PROGRAMS WHICH COULD FUND PARTS OR HOLES OF THESE PROJECTS BUT MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SUPPLEMENT THE ENTIRE SCOPE OF THE ENTIRE PROJECT OR MAY NOT BE WITHIN. THE DESIGNATED LANES OF FUNDING BASED ON THE GUARD RAILS BUILT BY THOSE PROGRAMS ITSELF. IT SEEMED TO BE A LITTLE BIT MORE FLEXIBLE THAN SOME OF THOSE WHICH HAVE ALREADY BEEN ESTABLISHED ON THE PREVIOUS YEAR'S BUDGET. I THINK SOUNDS THE- SOUNDS LIKE THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES WITH EXISTING PROGRAMS AND PERHAPS NOT IN ALIGNMENT IN TERMS OF. WHAT THAT CAN POTENTIALLY LOOK LIKE. OKAY THAT WOULD BE.

BUDGET TRAILER LANGUAGE WAS DUE TODAY AND WE DON'T HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AND SO- IT BRINGS UP THE QUESTION OF JURISDICTION AS WELL AS RESPONSIBILITY AND TRANSPARENCY WITH THE LEGISLATURE. TO ENSURE THAT AS WE MOVE FORWARD WITH US CERTAIN PROPOSALS WE HAVE DETAILS THAT ARE IMPORTANT- WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN. PUBLIC DOLLARS THAT WE- DON'T HAVE ANY INFORMATION ON AND SO IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO MAKE DECISIONS AND- HAVE BUDGET COMMITTEE AND HAVE DISCUSSIONS OF WHAT IS POSSIBLE WHEN.

THAT WAS GONNA BE THE GIST OF IT THANK YOU. DESCRIBE WOULD YOU LIKE TO COULD RESPOND. YES MADAM CHAIR I WILL- TO JUST A QUICK RECAP FOR YOU STERN- AS OF JANUARY TWENTY EIGHTH ON WE'VE HAD. THREE HUNDRED TWELVE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY ONE AWARDS TOTALING THREE BILLION FIVE HUNDRED SEVENTY SEVEN MILLION 700-406-0008 HUNDRED EIGHTY FOUR DOLLARS. ON THE AND EACH OF THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS THAT HAS RECEIVED A BREAK DOWN OF ALL THE AWARDS IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL DISTRICT AND THE SUMMARIES TO- HAVE BEEN INCLUDED BACKGROUND AS WELL AS EACH INDIVIDUAL BUSINESS AWARD AND ALSO DO YOU WANT TO KNOW. BACK TO UNVEILED NINE WARDS ARE STILL BEING MADE AND AT ANY TIME YOU CAN CHECK THE AWARD STATED THAT POSTED ON OUR WEBSITE UNDER PUBLICATIONS I'M WITH RESPECT TO YOUR- SPECIFIC QUESTION ABOUT ANNOUNCE ON THAT IS A NUMERICAL FIGURE CALCULATED ACROSS ON ALL OF THE GRANT AWARDS AND THE AVERAGE.

AS WELL AS TO THE SUBCOMMITTEE I WE'RE REALLY CONFIDENT WE'LL BE ABLE TO RESOLVE THE CHALLENGES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF KALAS BY MINISTRIES AUTHORITY BUT- WOULD NOTE SOME OF THESE ISSUES DO REQUIRE LEGISLATIVE ACTION TO AMEND THE STATUTORY GUIDELINES THAT ARE PROVEN TO BE INADVERTENT BARRIERS TO WORTHY APPLICANTS FROM GETTING CRITICALLY NEEDED RELIEF ESPECIALLY AS THE OMICRON VARIANT. HAS BECAUSE WE NEED TO SHUT DOWN FESTIVALS AND SHOWS CAN BE DELAYED- AND TREMENDOUS CUSTOMER CONCERN AROUND LARGE GATHERINGS. SOME OF THESE CONCERNS- WE NOTED LIKELY WILL IMPACT THE OVER FOUR HUNDRED APPLICANTS CRRENTLY IN REVIEW- NAMELY THE USE OF THE NORTH AMERICAN INDUSTRY INDUSTRY CLASSIFICATION CODES THE NEXT CODES- AND OTHER CONCERNS WE- WE DETAILED IN THE LETTER WE LOOK FORWARD TO DRAWING DOWN ON THAT- ON A SOLUTION TOGETHER- YOU KNOW. THAT COLLABORATIVELY WITH CALLASPO AND THE LEGISLATURE TO SEE IF PERHAPS WE CAN GET SOME EARLY BUDGET ACTION ITEM ON THIS- SIMPLY PUT WE'RE FOCUSED ON MAKING SURE THE DOLLARS IN THE PROGRAM ARE MAXIMIZED TO THE GREATEST EXTENT WHAT WE'RE WORRIED ABOUT IS THE EXISTENCE OF LEFT OR- LEFT OVER FUNDS FROM THIS PROGRAM THAT COULD HAVE GONE OVER THE APPLICANTS- THAT- THAN CALL UP CLOUD BACK- IN THESE DOCUMENTS DON'T GET A CHANCE. BECAUSE OF SOME OF THESE DISQUALIFIER IS. LIKE LIKE I SAID THE ONLY COUNTRY IN IS REALLY THROWING A WRENCH INTO THE PLANS FOR FULL REOPEN MISTER NAZARIAN YOU TOUCHED ON.

WORKING WITH AND THE LEGISLATURE IN THE ADMINISTRATION ON HOW THAT PROGRAM IS CRAFTED. BUT WE REALLY DO VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE ENTIRE PROPOSAL- AND THE EMPHASIS ON ON THE BORDER REGION. IS APPROPRIATE AND WE THINK VITALLY NEEDED- WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT AND THE FACT THAT. THE BORDER REGION- HASN'T RECEIVED A- SIGNIFICANT- INFUSION OF RESOURCES. AND SAN DIEGO IS ARE NOT JUST THE LARGEST BORDER CITY AND IN CALIFORNIA BUT IT'S THE LARGEST BORDER CITY IN THE ENTIRE COUNTRY SO WITH THAT WE VERY MUCH SUPPORT.

MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS THIS IS TERAFLOPS AND REPRESENTING THE TEAMSTERS PORT DIVISION ON ISSUE FIVE ON SUPPLY CHAIN RESILIENCE AND I WANT TO SPECIFICALLY COMMENT ON THE CREATION OF A STATE WIDE DATA PORTAL TO INCREASE TRANSPARENCY DATA COLLECTION AND DATA SHARING. WE WOULD URGE LEGISLATORS AND GOBIZ TO INCLUDE- IF THIS PROPOSAL MOVES FORWARD THE COLLECTION AND SHARING OF DATA SPECIFICALLY ON PORT TACK PORT TRUCK DRIVER EMPLOYMENT STATUS AND JOB QUALITY. THIS STATE IS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL TO CLEAR THE BACKLOG THAT THE PORTS AND CREATE A MORE EFFICIENT SYSTEM THAT POSSIBLE SUPPORTS THE TRANSITION TO ZERO EMISSIONS VEHICLES THAT MEET CLIMATE GOALS IN WHICH THE STATE HAS A VERY CLEAR INTEREST AND THE REASON THE STATE IS SO CRUCIAL IS BECAUSE- THE MISS CLASSIFICATION OF PORT TRUCK DRIVERS. IS RAMPANT AND HAS BEEN A SOURCE OF CONGESTION AND DELAYED FOR YEARS BEFORE THE PANDEMIC AND THE FRACTURED NATURE OF THE TRADE INDUSTRY MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE TO SCHEDULE EMPLOYMENT APPOINTMENT AND HAVE DRIVERS SHOW UP ON TIME TO MAKE THE ATTEMPT- APPOINTMENTS. AND EVEN THOUGH COMPANIES EXERT OVERWHELMING CONTROL OVER MISCLASSIFIED DRIVERS THEY'RE STILL UNABLE TO RETAIN A STABLE WORK FORCE TO TRACTOR DEPLOY EIGHT TRUCK DRIVER SUFFICIENTLY- OR DO ANY OF THE THINGS THAT WE NEED TO KEEP A GLOBAL PORT RUNNING SMOOTHLY- AND SO A CENTRALIZED DATA POOR PORTAL AND THE COLLECTION AND SHARING OF THIS DATA WOULD BE HELPFUL AND IN THE STATE'S INTEREST. BECAUSE IT WOULD MAKE IT EASIER TO ENFORCE LAWS ON MISS CLASSIFICATION SUCH AS THE CHAIRS THE BILL THAT'S NOW LAW EIGHTY SEVEN NINETY FOUR AND SB THREE THIRTY EIGHT IT WOULD HELP ELIMINATE FRICTION IN THE SYSTEM. AND THROUGH THE RE CLASSIFICATION OF TRUCK DRIVERS INCREASE THE ABILITY OF TRUCKING COMPANIES TO EFFICIENTLY SCHEDULE AND DEPLOY THEIR FLEETS OF TRUCKS TWENTY FORTY SEVEN IF NECESSARY. TO ADDRESS THE BACKLOG. AND IT WOULD ALSO FOR THE- OF WE ARE. ARE WE CAN DRIVE TO THAT TO THAT AREA. AND SO WE WOULD SAY THAT THE PRICING RESILIENCE STARTS WITH TRANSPARENCY IN DATA THAT GIVES THE INFORMATION TO CRAFT POLICIES TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE AND STARTING WITH TRACKING PORT TRUCK DRIVERS WHO ARE REALLY KEY PART OF LOGISTICS CHAIN. WILL NOT ONLY HELP WITH CLEARING THE BACKLOG BUT ALSO GIVE ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES A POWERFUL TOOL TO ENFORCE OUR LABOR AND ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AT THE STATE'S PORTS- SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU ON THIS PROPOSAL. I'M SHAPING IT AND FEEL IT IS VERY MUCH IN THE STATE'S INTEREST THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH NEXT CALLER. NEXT DEADLINE ONE SIXTEEN PLEASE GO AHEAD.
