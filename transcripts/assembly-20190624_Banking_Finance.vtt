FIONA MAW I AGAIN PRESENT THIS

00:31:34.592 --> 00:31:36.294
MEASURE THAT WE PRESENTED LAST

00:31:36.361 --> 00:31:37.595
YEAR.

00:31:37.662 --> 00:31:38.796
THE VOTERS OF THE STATE OF

00:31:38.863 --> 00:31:41.566
CALIFORNIA PASSED PROPOSITION

00:31:41.633 --> 00:31:44.068
SIXTY FOUR BY A VOTE OF 57% TO

00:31:44.135 --> 00:31:47.472
LEGALIZE RECREATIONAL MARIJUANA.

00:31:47.538 --> 00:31:49.040
THAT CREATED A MANAGEMENT

00:31:49.107 --> 00:31:51.609
CHALLENGE WHICH INFORMED BY A

00:31:51.676 --> 00:31:53.845
TENSION BETWEEN THE FEDERAL

00:31:53.911 --> 00:31:55.513
GOVERNMENT AND STATE GOVERNMENT.

00:31:55.580 --> 00:31:57.282
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SAYS THAT

00:31:57.348 --> 00:31:59.884
MARIJUANA IS A SCHEDULE ONE DRUG.

00:31:59.951 --> 00:32:01.819
AND AS SUCH YOU COULD NOT USE

00:32:01.886 --> 00:32:04.689
PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF THAT

00:32:04.756 --> 00:32:07.625
DRUG AND DEPOSITED INTO BANKS.

00:32:07.692 --> 00:32:10.261
SO THE QUESTION IS HOW DO WE ON

00:32:10.328 --> 00:32:12.397
THE ONE HAND AND MANAGE THE

00:32:12.463 --> 00:32:14.832
EXPECTATIONS OF THE VOTERS.

00:32:14.899 --> 00:32:16.367
DEAL WITH THE PUBLIC SAFETY

00:32:16.434 --> 00:32:18.870
ISSUES THAT INFORM THIS ISSUE

00:32:18.936 --> 00:32:20.505
DEAL WITH THE THE ACCOUNTING

00:32:20.571 --> 00:32:23.107
ISSUES AND DEAL WITH THE TAX

00:32:23.174 --> 00:32:26.010
COLLECTION ISSUES OF AN INDUSTRY.

00:32:26.077 --> 00:32:28.413
THAT'S ANYWHERE EXPECTED WIEN

00:32:28.479 --> 00:32:29.347
FIVE EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS AND

00:32:29.414 --> 00:32:31.149
REQUIRED TELLS ME THAT HE THINKS

00:32:31.215 --> 00:32:32.350
THERE'S TWO BILLION DOLLARS

00:32:32.417 --> 00:32:34.886
BURIED IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA

00:32:34.952 --> 00:32:39.090
HIS DISTRICT A FORTY MILLION

00:32:39.157 --> 00:32:40.892
DOLLARS IN A TRACTOR TRAILER.

00:32:40.958 --> 00:32:42.293
IT IS A PROBLEM WE HAVE SEEN

00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:44.529
STORIES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA.

00:32:44.595 --> 00:32:46.531
WHERE THERE HAS BEEN THE

00:32:46.597 --> 00:32:50.835
HORRIBLE -- BOB BERRY IS DEATHS

00:32:50.902 --> 00:32:53.371
AND ALL KINDS OF HORRIBLE THINGS.

00:32:53.438 --> 00:32:55.106
AND SO THE QUESTION IS WHAT WE

00:32:55.173 --> 00:32:57.575
DO HOW DO WE FIGURE OUT UNTIL

00:32:57.642 --> 00:32:59.243
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.

00:32:59.310 --> 00:33:01.346
ALLOWS US TO BANK THIS MONEY

00:33:01.412 --> 00:33:02.780
WHAT WE DO.

00:33:02.847 --> 00:33:05.516
AND SO ARE HONESTLY THIS IS NOT

00:33:05.583 --> 00:33:09.454
A THAT WAS CHAIRMAN OF THE WITH

00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:10.455
THE COMMITTEE WAS IT NEAR THE

00:33:10.521 --> 00:33:11.422
SENATE THAT THE REVENUE TAX

00:33:11.489 --> 00:33:12.423
COMMITTEE IN THE LOCAL

00:33:12.490 --> 00:33:14.425
GOVERNMENT GOVERNMENT FINANCES

00:33:14.492 --> 00:33:15.426
CALLED IN THE SENATE.

00:33:15.493 --> 00:33:17.895
AND ON THIS ISSUE CAME BEFORE ME

00:33:17.962 --> 00:33:19.364
WITH A NUMBER OF MEMBERS.

00:33:19.430 --> 00:33:20.264
AND AS SOMEONE WHO HAD

00:33:20.331 --> 00:33:21.666
EXPERIENCE IN THIS AREA THE LAW

00:33:21.733 --> 00:33:24.402
MANY YEARS AGO MY THOUGHT WAS TO

00:33:24.469 --> 00:33:26.671
COME UP WITH A LIMITED CHARTER

00:33:26.738 --> 00:33:28.239
BANK WHAT DOES THAT MEAN.

00:33:28.306 --> 00:33:29.807
WE HAVE THIS KIND OF INTERREGNUM

00:33:29.874 --> 00:33:31.142
WHERE WE'RE TRYING TO COME UP

00:33:31.209 --> 00:33:32.744
WITH THE PROCESS BUT WE DON'T

00:33:32.810 --> 00:33:34.379
WANT TO COME TO DO SOMETHING AND

00:33:34.445 --> 00:33:35.880
THAT SOMETHING BRAND NEW.

00:33:35.947 --> 00:33:38.750
SO THE IDEA WAS TO BOLT ON A

00:33:38.816 --> 00:33:41.018
LIMITED CHARTER BANK AND ON

00:33:41.085 --> 00:33:43.054
CREDIT UNION INTO THE BANKING

00:33:43.121 --> 00:33:44.655
SYSTEM UNDER THE BANKING

00:33:44.722 --> 00:33:45.890
COMMISSIONER WE CHANGE THE NAME

00:33:45.957 --> 00:33:46.891
TO THERE ARE NO IT'S CALLED BUT

00:33:46.958 --> 00:33:47.959
I STILL CALL.

00:33:48.025 --> 00:33:50.294
THE BANKING COMMISSIONER AND SO

00:33:50.361 --> 00:33:52.463
THE BOTTOM LINE IS WHAT WE DO

00:33:52.530 --> 00:33:54.098
AND WE CREATED THIS BANK WE

00:33:54.165 --> 00:33:55.400
FOUND OUT THAT THERE'S NINE

00:33:55.466 --> 00:33:56.300
HUNDRED AND TWENTY BRANCHES

00:33:56.367 --> 00:33:57.702
AROUND CALIFORNIA THE BEEN

00:33:57.769 --> 00:33:59.504
CLOSED SO WE COULD LITERALLY

00:33:59.570 --> 00:34:00.438
IT'S NOT VERY DIFFICULT TO HAVE

00:34:00.505 --> 00:34:02.240
ALL THESE SAFES ALL OVER THE

00:34:02.306 --> 00:34:02.573
PLACE TO PUT.

00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:03.741
MONEY IN THE BANKS.

00:34:03.808 --> 00:34:06.444
OR CREDIT UNIONS THE CASE MAY BE.

00:34:06.511 --> 00:34:08.546
AND WE CAME UP WITH FOR PURPOSES

00:34:08.613 --> 00:34:09.914
THAT WE WOULD LIMIT THIS TO

00:34:09.981 --> 00:34:11.382
PURPOSE NUMBER ONE IS TO PAY

00:34:11.449 --> 00:34:13.284
TAXES FEES LOCAL GOVERNMENT

00:34:13.351 --> 00:34:15.486
STATE GOVERNMENT AND THE LIKE

00:34:15.553 --> 00:34:17.155
WHERE YOU COULD USE A CHECK.

00:34:17.221 --> 00:34:19.123
FROM THE LIMITED CHARTER BANK

00:34:19.190 --> 00:34:20.691
THE CHECK WOULD LOOK LIKE THIS.

00:34:20.758 --> 00:34:22.427
AND IT WOULD JUST BASICALLY SAY

00:34:22.493 --> 00:34:25.763
THIS CHECK IS ISSUED BY S. P.

00:34:25.830 --> 00:34:27.498
FIFTY ONE CANNABIS BANK IN THE

00:34:27.565 --> 00:34:29.400
ONLY DEPOSIT CASH IN THE LIMITED

00:34:29.467 --> 00:34:30.268
CHARTER BANK.

00:34:30.334 --> 00:34:30.968
YOU COULDN'T DEPOSITS INTO

00:34:31.035 --> 00:34:32.270
ANOTHER FEDERAL BANKER STATE

00:34:32.336 --> 00:34:34.272
BANK THE ONLY COULD DEPOSITED

00:34:34.338 --> 00:34:36.007
INTO YOUR BANK OR TO ANOTHER

00:34:36.073 --> 00:34:37.308
BANK WHY IS THAT IMPORTANT.

00:34:37.375 --> 00:34:38.576
WELL IF YOU'RE GONNA GO PAY YOUR

00:34:38.643 --> 00:34:39.677
RENT IF YOU CAN GO PAID MONEY TO

00:34:39.744 --> 00:34:41.279
THE GOVERNMENT WHAT WE SEE IS

00:34:41.345 --> 00:34:43.147
BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSALS MANY OF

00:34:43.214 --> 00:34:44.248
THEM.

00:34:44.315 --> 00:34:45.349
WHERE WERE PAYING FOR HIGHER

00:34:45.416 --> 00:34:48.719
PATROL TO ACTUALLY -- ESCORT THE

00:34:48.786 --> 00:34:50.288
MONEY WE'RE PAYING FOR BULLET

00:34:50.354 --> 00:34:52.757
PROOF GLASS I TALKED TO ET DE ID

00:34:52.824 --> 00:34:53.958
NUMBER THE DEPARTMENTS AND THE

00:34:54.025 --> 00:34:55.893
CASH AND AND TO MANAGE TO COUNT

00:34:55.960 --> 00:34:57.628
ALL THE KINDS OF CASH SOMETIMES

00:34:57.695 --> 00:34:59.063
A MILLION DOLLARS A DAY THAT

00:34:59.130 --> 00:35:00.932
COMES INTO A GOVERNMENT OFFICE.

00:35:00.998 --> 00:35:01.599
WELL THE SAID YOU GET A MUCH OF

00:35:01.666 --> 00:35:03.334
CHECKS NOW THE GOVERNMENT CAN

00:35:03.401 --> 00:35:04.969
TAKE THESE CHECKS AND GO.

00:35:05.036 --> 00:35:06.537
CATCH THEM AT THE AT THE CHARTER

00:35:06.604 --> 00:35:08.372
BANK OR CREDIT STONE ACCOUNT IF

00:35:08.439 --> 00:35:09.941
THEY WILL BUT IT'S A CONVENIENCE

00:35:10.007 --> 00:35:11.843
CASH MANAGEMENT SYSTEM IF YOU

00:35:11.909 --> 00:35:12.643
WILL.

00:35:12.710 --> 00:35:14.212
SO WE SAID WHAT ARE THE FOUR

00:35:14.278 --> 00:35:15.580
THINGS THAT WE COULD DO THAT

00:35:15.646 --> 00:35:16.647
KIND OF LOW HANGING FRUIT THAT'S

00:35:16.714 --> 00:35:18.449
NOT TOO COMPLICATED ONE ALL YOUR

00:35:18.516 --> 00:35:20.351
GOVERNMENT FEES.

00:35:20.418 --> 00:35:21.886
WITHIN THE OPTION OF THE LOCAL

00:35:21.953 --> 00:35:28.426
GOVERNMENT. TO YOUR RENT.

00:35:28.493 --> 00:35:28.993
THE IDEA IS THAT YOU HAVE A

00:35:29.060 --> 00:35:30.061
LANDLORD WHO IS TEN FOLKS THAT

00:35:30.127 --> 00:35:30.828
ARE OUT THERE THAT ARE RENTING

00:35:30.895 --> 00:35:31.496
TO WHY THEY HAVE TO COME IN WITH

00:35:31.562 --> 00:35:32.730
BIG PILES OF CASH EVERY MONTH

00:35:32.797 --> 00:35:33.130
THAT GET A CHECK.

00:35:33.197 --> 00:35:34.565
AND DELIVER THREE YOUR VENDORS

00:35:34.632 --> 00:35:36.601
EUROPE EUROPE PLUMBER AND RATHER

00:35:36.667 --> 00:35:37.902
HAVING GIVE TWENTY TWO HUNDRED

00:35:37.969 --> 00:35:39.737
BUCKS TO A PLUMBER -- IN CASH

00:35:39.804 --> 00:35:41.072
YOU CAN ACTUALLY DELIVER CHECK

00:35:41.138 --> 00:35:42.907
AND PAY THE BILLS AND LASTLY TO

00:35:42.974 --> 00:35:44.075
INVEST THE MONEY.

00:35:44.141 --> 00:35:46.677
A AT THE STATE TREASURY WHERE

00:35:46.744 --> 00:35:47.211
IT'S WITHIN THE STATE OF

00:35:47.278 --> 00:35:48.312
CALIFORNIA.

00:35:48.379 --> 00:35:49.714
AND IN ESSENCE JUST TO KIND OF

00:35:49.780 --> 00:35:50.815
CUT TO THE CHASE OF HAPPY TO

00:35:50.882 --> 00:35:52.416
ANSWER THE QUESTIONS WHAT WE'RE

00:35:52.483 --> 00:35:53.618
REALLY DOING IS IT'S WE COULD

00:35:53.684 --> 00:35:54.819
CALL THE BANK.

00:35:54.886 --> 00:35:57.722
AND THE IDEA IS THAT ULTIMATELY.

00:35:57.788 --> 00:35:58.956
WENT WHEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

00:35:59.023 --> 00:36:00.525
CONFORMS AND THEY WILL AT SOME

00:36:00.591 --> 00:36:01.993
POINTS BECAUSE OTHER STATES HAVE

00:36:02.059 --> 00:36:03.828
SIMILAR KINDS OF ISSUES WHEN THE

00:36:03.895 --> 00:36:04.962
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CONFORMS.

00:36:05.029 --> 00:36:05.897
YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO TAKE

00:36:05.963 --> 00:36:07.832
THESE INSTITUTIONS AND ROLL THEM

00:36:07.899 --> 00:36:10.067
INTO EXISTING BANKS THE THE BIG

00:36:10.134 --> 00:36:10.902
BANKS WE'VE SEEN THIS WITH

00:36:10.968 --> 00:36:11.702
COMMITTEE BANKS ALL OVER THE

00:36:11.769 --> 00:36:13.004
STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

00:36:13.070 --> 00:36:14.839
AND SO IT BECOMES EASY BECAUSE

00:36:14.906 --> 00:36:16.274
THE ALL OF THE RULES AND

00:36:16.340 --> 00:36:18.042
REGULATIONS OF BANKING WILL

00:36:18.109 --> 00:36:19.844
APPLY WE DON'T WANT TO REINVENT

00:36:19.911 --> 00:36:21.512
A WHOLE NEW WORLD FOR THIS.

00:36:21.579 --> 00:36:22.747
SO THAT MEANS THAT THE PRODUCE

00:36:22.813 --> 00:36:24.148
YOUR OBLIGATIONS THE ROLE OF

00:36:24.215 --> 00:36:26.284
DIRECTORS THE AUDIT PROVISIONS

00:36:26.350 --> 00:36:28.085
ALL OF THE THINGS THAT INFORM

00:36:28.152 --> 00:36:29.520
WHAT BANKING.

00:36:29.587 --> 00:36:35.826
N. N. N. H. N. DOUG WITH THE

00:36:35.893 --> 00:36:38.663
COLUMN -- CREDIT UNIONS ARE.

00:36:38.729 --> 00:36:40.097
BASICALLY BAY FALL WITHIN THIS

00:36:40.164 --> 00:36:41.132
FRAMEWORK AND ANSWER THE LAST

00:36:41.198 --> 00:36:42.233
QUESTION IS WHAT HOUSES ALL PAID

00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:42.900
FOR WHAT REALLY HAPPENS OHIO HAS

00:36:42.967 --> 00:36:44.535
DONE THIS TO SOME EXTENT.

00:36:44.602 --> 00:36:45.803
DID YOU KNOW BANK WHAT IS

00:36:45.870 --> 00:36:47.605
BANKING BANKING IS I TAKE YOUR

00:36:47.672 --> 00:36:48.940
DEPOSIT I GIVE YOU THIS MUCH

00:36:49.006 --> 00:36:51.042
INTEREST I CAN I TAKE YOUR MONEY

00:36:51.108 --> 00:36:52.643
I LANDED TO SOMEBODY ELSE AND I

00:36:52.710 --> 00:36:53.744
MAKE THE BIG.

00:36:53.811 --> 00:36:55.379
RIGHT I PAY MY EXPENSES MY MAKE

00:36:55.446 --> 00:36:56.981
A PROFIT ON INTEREST WITH NO

00:36:57.048 --> 00:36:58.783
INTEREST BECAUSE NO LOANS IN

00:36:58.849 --> 00:36:59.350
THIS BANK IT'S NOT GONNA BE

00:36:59.417 --> 00:36:59.684
NORMAL BANK.

00:36:59.750 --> 00:37:01.018
IT'S LITERALLY DEPOSITORY

00:37:01.085 --> 00:37:05.957
INSTITUTION AND THE WAY IT'S

00:37:06.023 --> 00:37:06.591
GOING TO WORK AS YOU CAN CHARGE

00:37:06.657 --> 00:37:07.792
FEES.

00:37:07.858 --> 00:37:08.926
AND SO MY QUESTION TWO THOUSAND

00:37:08.993 --> 00:37:10.227
DOLLARS THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS A

00:37:10.294 --> 00:37:11.162
MONTH KEEP AN ACCOUNT AND MY

00:37:11.228 --> 00:37:11.762
QUESTION HOW DOES A CHECK BUT

00:37:11.829 --> 00:37:12.296
IT'S A LOT LESS MONEY IN

00:37:12.363 --> 00:37:12.930

00:37:12.997 --> 00:37:14.332
STUFF ASSOCIATED.

00:37:14.398 --> 00:37:16.000
THE FINAL POINT I WANT TO MAKE

00:37:16.067 --> 00:37:17.201
IS THAT ONE OF THE BIG ISSUES IN

00:37:17.268 --> 00:37:19.670
BANKING IS IS INSURANCE NO ONE

00:37:19.737 --> 00:37:21.272
WANTS TO TAKE THE MONEY GIVE IT

00:37:21.339 --> 00:37:22.406
TO A BANK AND THEN THE BANK IT'S

00:37:22.473 --> 00:37:24.208
ROBIN YOU LOSE ALL YOUR MONEY OR

00:37:24.275 --> 00:37:25.443
SEIZED OR WHATEVER THE CASE MAY

00:37:25.509 --> 00:37:26.611
BE.

00:37:26.677 --> 00:37:27.945
THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE

00:37:28.012 --> 00:37:30.081
CORPORATION IS NORMALLY THE

00:37:30.147 --> 00:37:31.716
ENTITY.

00:37:31.782 --> 00:37:33.551
THAT INSURERS I'VE MET WITH A

00:37:33.618 --> 00:37:34.986

00:37:37.188 --> 00:37:39.590
THEY WILL PROVIDE THE INSURANCE

00:37:39.657 --> 00:37:41.425
A TWO HUNDRED TWO THOUSAND

00:37:41.492 --> 00:37:42.560
DOLLARS PER COUNT ON LIKE THAT

00:37:42.627 --> 00:37:43.394
FEDERAL DEPOSIT CHURCH

00:37:43.461 --> 00:37:44.762
CORPORATIONS TO EARN FIFTY

00:37:44.829 --> 00:37:47.098
THOUSAND DOLLARS PER PER.

00:37:47.164 --> 00:37:48.633
CUSTOMER I HAVE TEN ACCOUNTS A

00:37:48.699 --> 00:37:49.266
GET TWO POINT FIVE MILLION OF

00:37:49.333 --> 00:37:51.802

00:37:51.869 --> 00:37:53.671
WITH A PRETTY ELEGANT APPROACH.

00:37:53.738 --> 00:37:54.672
EIGHTY FOUR VOTES THROUGH BOTH

00:37:54.739 --> 00:37:56.107

00:37:56.173 --> 00:37:58.542

DON'T WANT TO DEAL WITH AT THE

00:38:05.449 --> 00:38:06.317
END OF THE TERM SO THE

MISS WITH AS WAS INDICATED

00:44:54.691 --> 00:44:56.193
TRYING TO OPEN BANK ACCOUNTS

00:44:56.260 --> 00:44:57.628
THERE WAS AN AGREEMENT WITH THE

00:44:57.694 --> 00:44:58.929
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT COLORADO

00:44:58.996 --> 00:45:03.734
RELATING -- TO WHICH MCCALL IT --

00:45:03.801 --> 00:45:06.370
TO BANKING DEAL THERE A HIGH --

00:45:06.437 --> 00:45:07.971
HAS A CHARGING BANKS BUT IT'S

00:45:08.038 --> 00:45:09.673
REALLY HIT AND MISS IT'S REALLY

00:45:09.740 --> 00:45:11.341
BEEN HARD WASHINGTON'S REALLY

00:45:11.408 --> 00:45:11.542
BEEN.

00:45:11.608 --> 00:45:13.277
A JOURNALIST STRUGGLING WITH IT

00:45:13.343 --> 00:45:15.012
AND AND AND QUITE FRANKLY

00:45:15.079 --> 00:45:16.246
THEY'VE ALL CALLED US AND

00:45:16.313 --> 00:45:17.815
LOOKING AT THIS HIGH TIER

00:45:17.881 --> 00:45:18.449
BECAUSE THEY THINK IT'S A PRETTY

00:45:18.515 --> 00:45:19.550
GOOD IDEA.

00:45:19.616 --> 00:45:20.617
I MEAN BASICALLY YOU UNDERSTAND

00:45:20.684 --> 00:45:22.352
THIS IS A PRIVATE BANK NOT A

00:45:22.419 --> 00:45:23.420
PUBLIC BANK SO WHAT'S GOING TO

00:45:23.487 --> 00:45:24.721
HAPPEN IS INVESTORS ARE GOING TO

00:45:24.788 --> 00:45:25.956
COME ALONG.

00:45:26.023 --> 00:45:27.291
JUST LIKE YOU DO WHEN YOU FORM A

00:45:27.357 --> 00:45:29.359
BANK AND THEY'RE GONNA PUT UP

00:45:29.426 --> 00:45:30.427
TEN MILLION DOLLARS OR WHATEVER

00:45:30.494 --> 00:45:31.829
THEY'RE GONNA PUT UP IN CAPITAL

00:45:31.895 --> 00:45:33.297
THEY GET TO INVEST THE MONEY

00:45:33.363 --> 00:45:34.731
THEY'RE GONNA RENTED A BANK

00:45:34.798 --> 00:45:35.599
BRANCH.

00:45:35.666 --> 00:45:37.234
AND THEY'RE GONNA OWN A BANK AND

00:45:37.301 --> 00:45:37.835
THEY'RE GONNA HOPEFULLY MAKE

00:45:37.901 --> 00:45:40.104
MONEY ON IT AND I THINK PROBABLY

00:45:40.170 --> 00:45:41.205
WHAT THEY'RE LOOKING FOR IS A

00:45:41.271 --> 00:45:41.972
YOU KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE THE

00:45:42.039 --> 00:45:43.440
INDUSTRY OF COME AND TALK TO US

00:45:43.507 --> 00:45:44.508
BECAUSE THEY WANT TO BANK TO BE

00:45:44.575 --> 00:45:46.176
ABLE TO JUST LIKE REAL ESTATE.

00:45:46.243 --> 00:45:48.378
DEVELOPERS DO TO GET A BANK TO

00:45:48.445 --> 00:45:49.046
HELP THEM IN THEIR OWN

00:45:49.113 --> 00:45:50.414
BUSINESSES AND THEN WHAT'S GOING

00:45:50.481 --> 00:45:51.748
TO HAPPEN IS ONCE IT BECOMES

00:45:51.815 --> 00:45:53.484
LEGALIZED AS I INDICATED MY

00:45:53.550 --> 00:45:54.384
OPENING.

00:45:54.451 --> 00:45:56.587
THE THE LARGER BANKS ARE GOING

00:45:56.653 --> 00:45:57.221
TO COME IN AND AND AND ROLL THEM

00:45:57.287 --> 00:45:59.123
UP AND THEY'RE GONNA MAKE BIG

00:45:59.189 --> 00:46:00.457
PROFITS CAUSING OLYMPIC AGAIN A

00:46:00.524 --> 00:46:01.024
FIVE ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN

00:46:01.091 --> 00:46:02.893
DEPOSITS OR WHATEVER IT IS AND

00:46:02.960 --> 00:46:03.527
THEY'RE GONNA WANT TO BANK WITH

00:46:03.594 --> 00:46:04.261
THOSE FOLKS.

00:46:04.328 --> 00:46:05.996
ANDTHEY'LL BUILD RELATIONSHIPS

00:46:06.063 --> 00:46:07.197
SO THE IDEA IS IT'S FORMED

00:46:07.264 --> 00:46:09.333
AROUND REALLY QUITE FRANKLY IT

00:46:09.399 --> 00:46:11.368
WAS MY ADVERSE REACTION TO THE

00:46:11.435 --> 00:46:12.870
PUBLIC BANK IDEA BECAUSE I

00:46:12.936 --> 00:46:14.138
THOUGHT THAT WOULDN'T HAPPEN IN

00:46:14.204 --> 00:46:14.905
TEN YEARS.

00:46:14.972 --> 00:46:16.740
AND THE IDEA WAS WE HAVE A SENSE

00:46:16.807 --> 00:46:18.775
OF URGENCY HERE TO GET THIS UP

00:46:18.842 --> 00:46:19.710
AND RUNNING AS QUICKLY AS

00:46:19.776 --> 00:46:21.545
POSSIBLE FOR THE PUBLIC SAFETY

00:46:21.612 --> 00:46:22.479
FOR ACCOUNTING FOR ALL THOSE

00:46:22.546 --> 00:46:23.847
REASONS I WOULD SUSPECT.

00:46:23.914 --> 00:46:25.182
THAT GOVERNMENT IS NOT RECEIVING

00:46:25.249 --> 00:46:26.683
AS MUCH MONEY AS IT SHOULD

00:46:26.750 --> 00:46:27.918
BECAUSE THE HASSLE OF JUST

00:46:27.985 --> 00:46:29.119
DEALING WITH THE CASH VERSUS

00:46:29.186 --> 00:46:30.254
WRITING A CHECK TO PAY THE

00:46:30.320 --> 00:46:31.922
VARIOUS GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES

00:46:31.989 --> 00:46:32.856
ONE OF THE REASONS WHY THE

00:46:32.923 --> 00:46:40.164
ESTIMATES IN MY JUDGMENT IS

00:46:40.230 --> 00:46:42.299
LOWER THAN IT SHOULD BE.

00:46:42.366 --> 00:46:44.034
I REALIZE THAT THAT THIS ISSUE

00:46:44.101 --> 00:46:45.702
YOUR INTERIM MEASURE THAT'S

00:46:45.769 --> 00:46:47.771
RIGHT I A WONDER AT THE WRIST --

00:46:47.838 --> 00:46:49.373
AND THE MOVEMENT.

00:46:49.439 --> 00:46:51.208
TO ESTABLISH A PUBLIC BANKING

00:46:51.275 --> 00:46:52.509
AND IN THAT THE BANKING

00:46:52.576 --> 00:46:53.210
COMMITTEE.

00:46:53.277 --> 00:46:55.646
I ASKED THAT QUESTION WHETHER

00:46:55.712 --> 00:46:57.381
THE DO REAL HIDDEN MOTIVATION OF

00:46:57.447 --> 00:46:58.849
THAT THE IDEA WAS SET TO

00:46:58.916 --> 00:47:00.083
ACCOMMODATE THIS -- CANNABIS --

00:47:00.150 --> 00:47:04.388
INDUSTRY -- MONEY AND EVERYBODY

00:47:04.454 --> 00:47:10.794
IN THE AGAINST HIS OWN PEOPLE.

00:47:10.861 --> 00:47:10.961
IT.

00:47:11.028 --> 00:47:12.663
IF THAT IDEA PUBLIC BANKING

00:47:12.729 --> 00:47:14.498
COURSED THROUGH.

00:47:14.565 --> 00:47:16.266
THEN NOW -- WILL THE PUBLIC

00:47:16.333 --> 00:47:19.636
BANKING -- LUCKY CITIES AND

00:47:19.703 --> 00:47:22.372
COUNTIES OR WHATEVER AND LOCAL

00:47:22.439 --> 00:47:25.976
UNITS -- SET UP -- UP OUR ARE

00:47:26.043 --> 00:47:29.246
THEY AVAILABLE FOR ALL OF TIME

00:47:29.313 --> 00:47:31.415
NEEDED TO TAKE THAT THIS KIND OF

00:47:31.481 --> 00:47:33.116
A CAN IT WAS -- WELL WE'VE

00:47:33.183 --> 00:47:33.750
LOOKED AT AND THAT WAS A NUMBER

00:47:33.817 --> 00:47:36.286
OF LAWYERS ON THE SITUATION IN.

00:47:36.353 --> 00:47:37.721
THE PROBLEM WHETHER IT'S A STATE

00:47:37.788 --> 00:47:39.890
INSTITUTION OR A PRIVATE

00:47:39.957 --> 00:47:41.925
INSTITUTION THE NOTION OF

00:47:41.992 --> 00:47:43.160
WORKING TO THE FEDERAL CLEARING

00:47:43.227 --> 00:47:44.161
HOUSES.

00:47:44.228 --> 00:47:45.996
AND THE NOTION OF HAVING FDIC

00:47:46.063 --> 00:47:49.166
INSURANCE ALL INFORMS THE EXACT

00:47:49.233 --> 00:47:49.800
SAME PROBLEM THAT WE'RE TRYING

00:47:49.866 --> 00:47:50.801
TO AVOID.

00:47:50.867 --> 00:47:51.935
BASICALLY THE NOTIONS HERE'S

00:47:52.002 --> 00:47:53.303
WHAT'S CALLED A CLOSED LOOP

00:47:53.370 --> 00:47:55.372
SYSTEM SO THAT YOU ONLY CAN

00:47:55.439 --> 00:47:57.174
DEPOSIT MONEY OR TAKE MONEY OUT

00:47:57.241 --> 00:47:58.609
OF YOUR BANK BRANCH NOW LET'S

00:47:58.675 --> 00:48:01.178
ASSUME THERE'S IT IN IT IS --

00:48:01.245 --> 00:48:02.346
TEN COMPANIES TO COME ALONG AND

00:48:02.412 --> 00:48:04.047
FORM BANKS THEY COULD FORM IN

00:48:04.114 --> 00:48:05.682
IRAQ INNER BANKING AGREEMENTS

00:48:05.749 --> 00:48:07.951
AMONG THEM SO I COULD GO IN CASH

00:48:08.018 --> 00:48:10.020
MY CANNABIS BANK SAY IN IN IN

00:48:10.087 --> 00:48:11.722
ANOTHER IN ANOTHER COUNTY IF

00:48:11.788 --> 00:48:13.023
THEY HAD ONE AND THEY COULD HAVE

00:48:13.090 --> 00:48:14.725
AGREEMENTS AMONG THEMSELVES.

00:48:14.791 --> 00:48:17.427
BUT THE KEY FRAMEWORK IS IT HAS

00:48:17.494 --> 00:48:18.895
TO OPERATE ONLY WITHIN THE STATE.

00:48:18.962 --> 00:48:20.864
WE CANNOT USE FEDERAL INSURANCE

00:48:20.931 --> 00:48:22.032
AND I CAN'T USE THE FEDERAL

00:48:22.099 --> 00:48:23.967
CLEARING HOUSE IT HAS TO BE WITH

00:48:24.034 --> 00:48:25.502
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND

00:48:25.569 --> 00:48:26.670
WITHIN OUR CONSTITUTIONAL

00:48:26.737 --> 00:48:28.405
CONSTRAINTS SO THAT WOULD I

00:48:28.472 --> 00:48:29.573
WOULD NOT THINK.

00:48:29.640 --> 00:48:31.174
THAT A PUBLIC BANK COULD COULD

00:48:31.241 --> 00:48:32.542
REALLY DO CANNABIS THE PUBLIC

00:48:32.609 --> 00:48:34.144
BANKING IS ALL ABOUT TRYING TO

00:48:34.211 --> 00:48:36.213
REDUCE COSTS AND AFFORDING

00:48:36.280 --> 00:48:37.180
WHETHER IT'S STUDENT LOANS OR

00:48:37.247 --> 00:48:38.248
LOW INCOME HOUSING OR THOSE

00:48:38.315 --> 00:48:39.616
KINDS OF THINGS.

00:48:39.683 --> 00:48:41.218
IS REALLY THE THE IMPETUS OF THE

00:48:41.285 --> 00:48:47.991
PUBLIC BANKING SYSTEM AS FAR AS

00:48:48.058 --> 00:48:48.325
I CAN DETECT.

00:48:48.392 --> 00:48:49.693
THANK.

00:48:49.760 --> 00:48:50.560
ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS

DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS OVERSIGHT

00:48:56.066 --> 00:48:57.234
CONCERNS HAVE BEEN AND HOW.

00:48:57.301 --> 00:48:58.402

AND THAT'S WHAT INFORMS MY

00:50:06.169 --> 00:50:08.105

THAT SOLUTION NOT SUPER CLEAR

00:50:31.328 --> 00:50:32.796
BUT A THINK OUR STATE IS A VERY

00:50:32.863 --> 00:50:34.931
MUCH IN FAVOR OF TRYING TO FIND

CONSERVATIVE VIEW ABOUT WHAT

00:50:49.312 --> 00:50:51.148
THIS OPENING ACT LOOKS LIKE WE

00:50:51.214 --> 00:50:52.883
KNOW THAT IF THERE'S A LONGER

00:50:52.949 --> 00:50:54.418
PERIOD OF TIME BEFORE CANNABIS

00:50:54.484 --> 00:50:55.719

AND THEN THE GIVEN OPPORTUNITY

00:51:11.435 --> 00:51:12.636
AND THERE'S SOME CHALLENGES IN

00:51:12.702 --> 00:51:14.938
THIS IS NO QUESTION WE SOUGHT.

00:51:15.005 --> 00:51:16.106
TO IF SOMEONE HAS A BUNCH OF

00:51:16.173 --> 00:51:17.674
