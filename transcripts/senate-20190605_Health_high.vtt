THE BILL I'M GONNA TAKE THIS

00:20:15.147 --> 00:20:16.915
BILL IN THREE PARTS THE FIRST

00:20:16.982 --> 00:20:19.284
PART DOES DIRECTLY DEAL WITH THE

00:20:19.351 --> 00:20:21.253
EMERGENCY ROOM SERVICES.

00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:22.387
MANY OF THE REEMERGENCE THE

00:20:22.454 --> 00:20:23.622
ROOMS THAT HAVE CLOSED HAVE BEEN

00:20:23.689 --> 00:20:24.690
CLOSED WITH ALONG WITH A

00:20:24.756 --> 00:20:26.058
HOSPITAL OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS

00:20:26.124 --> 00:20:27.793
OR FOR FINANCIAL REASONS SO WE

00:20:27.859 --> 00:20:30.228
HAVE A DEEP CONCERN ABOUT ADDING.

00:20:30.295 --> 00:20:32.097
THE LENGTH OF TIME -- THE SIX

00:20:32.164 --> 00:20:34.399
MONTH REQUIREMENT -- TO THE BILL

00:20:34.466 --> 00:20:36.735
WHEN OUR HOSPITAL IS FAILING AND

00:20:36.802 --> 00:20:38.236
THEY'RE WORKING O IN RED.

00:20:38.303 --> 00:20:41.006
AND THEN TRYING TO MANAGE THAT

00:20:41.073 --> 00:20:43.709
FOR ANOTHER THREE TO FOUR MONTHS --

00:20:43.775 --> 00:20:45.043
IN ADDITION ONCE WE ANNOUNCED

00:20:45.110 --> 00:20:46.912
THE CLOSURE WE ACTUALLY TRY AND

00:20:46.979 --> 00:20:48.513
HELP OUR EMPLOYEES FIND.

00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:50.582
NEW JOBS THEY LOOK FOR NEW JOBS

00:20:50.649 --> 00:20:52.017
SO WE'RE DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT

00:20:52.084 --> 00:20:53.118
THE REDUCED STAFFING

00:20:53.185 --> 00:20:55.554
IMPLICATIONS FOR THE OPERATIONS

00:20:55.621 --> 00:20:56.221
OF THE HOSPITAL.

00:20:56.288 --> 00:20:57.956
THE OTHER TWO SECTIONS HOWEVER

00:20:58.023 --> 00:20:59.191
HAVEN'T BEEN MASSIVE MEANT

00:20:59.257 --> 00:21:01.293
MENTIONED FOR THE SECOND SECTION

00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:03.061
OF THE BILL ACTUALLY ADDS THE

00:21:03.128 --> 00:21:04.096
SIX MONTHS TO A CHANGE IN

00:21:04.162 --> 00:21:05.731
SERVICE.

00:21:05.797 --> 00:21:07.699
THAT MEANS THAT IF OUR HOSPITALS

00:21:07.766 --> 00:21:10.669
NICK YOU WANTS TO REDUCE ITS

00:21:10.736 --> 00:21:13.171
NUMBER OF BEDS BY TWO BY.

00:21:13.238 --> 00:21:15.340
TWO AND THEN MOVE THEM TO A PICK

00:21:15.407 --> 00:21:16.742
YOU WE WOULD HAVE TO WAIT SIX

00:21:16.808 --> 00:21:18.443
MONTHS.

00:21:18.510 --> 00:21:21.046
BEFORE WE CAN START THAT PROCESS.

00:21:21.113 --> 00:21:23.148
OR IF THEY WANTED TO CLOSE THE

00:21:23.215 --> 00:21:25.450
SERVICE -- SO THAT THEY CAN OPEN

00:21:25.517 --> 00:21:27.853
ANOTHER WE CAN'T START THAT

00:21:27.919 --> 00:21:29.254
PROCESS FOR SIX MONTHS.

00:21:29.321 --> 00:21:31.556
BECAUSE WE HAVE TO NOTIFY FOR

00:21:31.623 --> 00:21:33.025
THE CLOSURE AND THEN START THE

00:21:33.091 --> 00:21:35.794
PROCESS OF BEGINNING THE NEW

00:21:35.861 --> 00:21:37.162
SERVICE SO FOR US THAT.

00:21:37.229 --> 00:21:39.064
ADDITIONAL TIME IN WHICH WE WANT

00:21:39.131 --> 00:21:40.532
TO CHANGE A SERVICE FOR A

00:21:40.599 --> 00:21:42.467
PATIENT OR FOR THE NEEDS OF THE

00:21:42.534 --> 00:21:45.637
COMMUNITY COULD BE CRITICAL --

00:21:45.704 --> 00:21:46.705
TO FOR EXAMPLE OF OUR BURN

00:21:46.772 --> 00:21:48.373
CENTER NEEDED TO CHANGE A

00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:50.509
DYNAMIC REDUCE IT SERVICES AND

00:21:50.575 --> 00:21:52.044
THEN WE MAKE THAT A MED SURGE

00:21:52.110 --> 00:21:53.512
WE'D HAVE TO WAIT FOR THAT

00:21:53.578 --> 00:21:55.447
NOTIFICATION PERIOD.

00:21:55.514 --> 00:21:57.082
UNDERSTANDING THE CD PAGE --

00:21:57.149 --> 00:21:59.117
PROCESS THE WAY WE DO WE

00:21:59.184 --> 00:22:00.786
SPONSORED A BILL LAST YEAR THAT

00:22:00.852 --> 00:22:02.788
ALLOWS THAT REQUIRE CD PAGE TO

00:22:02.854 --> 00:22:04.489
DO THEIR APPROVAL PROCESS AND A

00:22:04.556 --> 00:22:04.823
HUNDRED DAYS.

00:22:04.890 --> 00:22:06.992
BECAUSE IT WAS LONGER THAN THAT

00:22:07.059 --> 00:22:08.293
ON AVERAGE AS MUCH AS WE LOVE

00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:09.795
OUR CD PAGE PARTNERS WE WERE

00:22:09.861 --> 00:22:11.496
REALLY INTRODUCED A BILL TO

00:22:11.563 --> 00:22:13.899
FORCE THEM. TO REALLY SHORTEN

00:22:13.965 --> 00:22:15.901
THEIR TIME FRAME SO FOR US TO

00:22:15.967 --> 00:22:17.602
HAVE TO WAIT THE SIX MONTHS

00:22:17.669 --> 00:22:19.438
BECAUSE WERE CLOSING A PART OF A

00:22:19.504 --> 00:22:22.040
SERVICE AND THEN TO MANAGE THAT

00:22:22.107 --> 00:22:23.375
NEXT CHANGE ALTHOUGH THE BILL

00:22:23.442 --> 00:22:24.843
DOESN'T SAY WE HAVE TO WAIT FOR

00:22:24.910 --> 00:22:26.011
AN ADDITIONAL SERVICE.

00:22:26.078 --> 00:22:28.046
NOW WE STILL HAVE TO WAIT TO

00:22:28.113 --> 00:22:29.281
CLOSE THE SERVICE AND USUALLY

00:22:29.347 --> 00:22:30.949
WERE CLOSING THE SERVICE AND

00:22:31.016 --> 00:22:32.617
REPLACING IT WITH SOMETHING ELSE.

00:22:32.684 --> 00:22:34.486
SO FOR US THAT'S AN ADDITIONAL

00:22:34.553 --> 00:22:36.221
SIX MONTHS ON TOP OF A THREE

00:22:36.288 --> 00:22:38.790
MONTH -- HUNDRED DAY PERIOD --

00:22:38.857 --> 00:22:40.459
AND THEN THE THE SORT OF CHANGE

00:22:40.525 --> 00:22:42.294
IN SERVICE THE NEXT SECTION OF

00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:43.295
THE BILL THE THIRD SECTION IS

00:22:43.361 --> 00:22:44.529
REALLY THE SUPPLEMENTAL SERVICES

00:22:44.596 --> 00:22:45.964
WHICH ARE DEFINED SET OF

00:22:46.031 --> 00:22:47.499
SERVICES -- AND THEN YOU HAVE

00:22:47.566 --> 00:22:48.600
ANOTHER PART OF THE BILL TO TALK

00:22:48.667 --> 00:22:49.735
ABOUT A CHANGE IN SERVICE AND

00:22:49.801 --> 00:22:50.836
WOULD CREATE SOME CONFUSION

00:22:50.902 --> 00:22:51.937
AROUND WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

00:22:52.003 --> 00:22:52.471
WHEN IT.

00:22:52.537 --> 00:22:54.539
COMES TO HOSPITAL OPERATIONS WE

00:22:54.606 --> 00:22:56.041
CHANGE OUR SERVICES ALL THE TIME

00:22:56.108 --> 00:22:57.909
WE CHANGE THE TYPE OF MRI

00:22:57.976 --> 00:22:59.344
MACHINES WE USE IN THERE FOR

00:22:59.411 --> 00:23:00.378
THAT COULD BE A SERVICE OF THE

00:23:00.445 --> 00:23:02.180
MRI MACHINE IS USED FOR A NEW

00:23:02.247 --> 00:23:03.982
SERVICE OR A DIFFERENT SERVICE.

00:23:04.049 --> 00:23:05.784
WE CHANGE THE NUMBER OF BEDS IN

00:23:05.851 --> 00:23:07.586

VARIOUS PLACES IN THE HOSPITAL

00:23:10.589 --> 00:23:12.424
SO FOR US THE CHANGE IN SERVICES

00:23:12.491 --> 00:23:13.959
BECOMING AS WE TAKE A DEEPER

00:23:14.025 --> 00:23:15.727
LOOK INTO THIS BILL TO WORK WITH

00:23:15.794 --> 00:23:16.361
THE AUTHOR.

00:23:16.428 --> 00:23:17.996
IT'S BECOMING A DEEPER SET OF

00:23:18.063 --> 00:23:22.200
CONCERNS AND HOW IT WILL DELAY

00:23:22.267 --> 00:23:24.136
THE PER IN OF THE SERVICES THAT

00:23:24.202 --> 00:23:25.470
ARE NEEDED FOR THAT COMMUNITY SO.

00:23:25.537 --> 00:23:27.839
FOR THOSE REASONS REMAIN OPPOSED.

00:23:27.906 --> 00:23:30.342
OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION.

00:23:30.408 --> 00:23:32.177
FACING NINE QUESTIONS MANY

00:23:32.244 --> 00:23:33.678
MEMBERS CENTER STONE YEAH THANK

00:23:33.745 --> 00:23:35.747
YOU -- CATHERINE IF I CAN ASK

00:23:35.814 --> 00:23:37.649
YOU A FEW QUESTIONS -- YOU KNOW

00:23:37.716 --> 00:23:39.251
WE WE WE THE LEGISLATURE HAS

00:23:39.317 --> 00:23:40.285
STRUGGLED IN THE PAST FEW YEARS

00:23:40.352 --> 00:23:42.187
OVER THE THREE FORTY B. PROGRAM

00:23:42.254 --> 00:23:43.755
AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT.

00:23:43.822 --> 00:23:45.423
MY DISTRICT IF THAT PROGRAM GOES

00:23:45.490 --> 00:23:47.492
AWAY HOSPITAL CLOSE.

00:23:47.559 --> 00:23:48.894
SO.

00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:50.095
HOW DO YOU ENVISION THIS

00:23:50.162 --> 00:23:52.197
LEGISLATION TO BE ENFORCED IF A

00:23:52.264 --> 00:23:54.699
HOSPITAL CLOSES ABRUPTLY GOES

00:23:54.766 --> 00:23:56.001
INTO BANKRUPTCY?

00:23:56.067 --> 00:23:57.502
WHAT WHAT'S THE REMEDY

00:23:57.569 --> 00:23:57.803
[inaudible]

00:23:57.869 --> 00:24:00.172
I THINK.

00:24:00.238 --> 00:24:01.973
I THINK WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IS

00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:04.276
THAT CV PH WOULD COME IN AND

00:24:04.342 --> 00:24:05.811
CLOSE THE HOSPITAL BECAUSE WE

00:24:05.877 --> 00:24:07.546
DON'T HAVE STAFF TO PROVIDE THE

SERVICE WE STILL ARE A LICENSED

00:24:09.014 --> 00:24:10.315
ENTITY THAT HAVEN'T PROVIDED A

00:24:10.382 --> 00:24:11.383
CERTAIN LEVEL.

00:24:11.449 --> 00:24:14.753
I WOULD HOPE THAT -- SHOULD THE

00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:16.855
PENALTY BILL GET PASSED WERE NOT

00:24:16.922 --> 00:24:19.691
ALSO PENALIZED ON TOP OF FIFTH --

00:24:19.758 --> 00:24:21.459
BUT IT WOULD IT IS A FRUSTRATING

00:24:21.526 --> 00:24:23.995
SITUATION FOR HOSPITALS WHO --

00:24:24.062 --> 00:24:25.197
AND USUALLY WHEN THE HOSPITAL

00:24:25.263 --> 00:24:28.066
CLOSES FOR FINANCIAL REASONS --

00:24:28.133 --> 00:24:29.568
I THINK THE INSTANCE YOU TALKED

00:24:29.634 --> 00:24:31.036
ABOUT WAS BECAUSE OF SEISMIC IT

00:24:31.102 --> 00:24:31.870
WAS A DIFFERENT SET OF

00:24:31.937 --> 00:24:34.172
CIRCUMSTANCES BUT WE'VE HAD

00:24:34.239 --> 00:24:36.374
HOSPITALS HAVE CLOSED BECAUSE I

00:24:36.441 --> 00:24:37.709
THINK WE THE WE'VE HAD HOSPITALS

00:24:37.776 --> 00:24:39.311
ARE CLOSING BECAUSE THEY CAN'T

00:24:39.377 --> 00:24:40.812
AFFORD TO STAY OPEN THEY CAN'T

00:24:40.879 --> 00:24:42.347
PAY PAYROLL THEY CAN'T ALL OF

00:24:42.414 --> 00:24:43.014
THOSE THINGS.

00:24:43.081 --> 00:24:44.416
AND SO SIX MONTHS COULD

00:24:44.482 --> 00:24:45.851
FRUSTRATE OKAY SO IT WAS.

00:24:45.917 --> 00:24:46.852
A FINANCIAL MIGHT HAVE BEEN IT

00:24:46.918 --> 00:24:49.187
YOU KNOW I RECOGNIZING THAT THE

00:24:49.254 --> 00:24:50.088
COMMUTER HOUSE ALONG BEACH HAD

00:24:50.155 --> 00:24:51.857
MARRIED REASONS SO THAT'S A

00:24:51.923 --> 00:24:53.458
REALITY AND THEN I SO I'LL POINT

00:24:53.525 --> 00:24:54.726
TO ANOTHER EXAMPLE THAT HAPPENED

00:24:54.793 --> 00:24:56.328
IN MY AREA ALBEIT A DIFFERENT

00:24:56.394 --> 00:24:58.163
COUNTY THAT WE HAD A HOSPITAL

00:24:58.230 --> 00:24:59.331
DEAREST CALL FARBER COST BATTLE.

00:24:59.397 --> 00:25:00.498
THAT WAS HAVING SOME FINANCIAL

00:25:00.565 --> 00:25:01.967
DIFFICULTIES.

00:25:02.033 --> 00:25:03.969
AND WHEN IT BECAME APPARENT THAT

00:25:04.035 --> 00:25:07.405
THEY WERE PROBABLY NOT GONNA BE

00:25:07.472 --> 00:25:08.006
ABLE TO STAY IN BUSINESS VERY

00:25:08.073 --> 00:25:08.640
LONG.

00:25:08.707 --> 00:25:09.641
ALL THEIR EMPLOYEES FLED.

00:25:09.708 --> 00:25:11.042
AND THEY HAD NO STAFF TO TAKE

00:25:11.109 --> 00:25:13.979
CARE OF THEIR EMERGENCY ROOM SO --

00:25:14.045 --> 00:25:15.680
USUALLY THE THE NURSES AND

00:25:15.747 --> 00:25:17.349
DOCTORS KNOW WHAT A HOSPITAL IS

00:25:17.415 --> 00:25:18.650
A GOOD FISCAL HEALTH ARE NOT

00:25:18.717 --> 00:25:20.018
GOOD FISCAL HEALTH AND IF

00:25:20.085 --> 00:25:20.852
THERE'S A RUMOR GOING AROUND

00:25:20.919 --> 00:25:21.586
THAT.

00:25:21.653 --> 00:25:23.688
THE HOSPITALS GOING TO CLOSE AND

00:25:23.755 --> 00:25:25.991
YOUR EMPLOYEES FULLY -- I'M NOT

00:25:26.057 --> 00:25:26.791
SURE HOW YOU'RE GONNA

00:25:26.858 --> 00:25:28.693
COMPREHENSIVELY AND EFFECTIVELY

00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:30.762
AND SAFELY OPERATE AN EMERGENCY

00:25:30.829 --> 00:25:31.963
ROOM AND I THINK YOU KINDA

00:25:32.030 --> 00:25:32.964
HIGHLIGHTED THAT AS ONE OF YOUR

00:25:33.031 --> 00:25:33.832
POINTS.

00:25:33.899 --> 00:25:36.201
AND THEN LASTLY HAVE YOU WORK

00:25:36.268 --> 00:25:37.802
WITH THE AUTHOR TO COME UP WITH

00:25:37.869 --> 00:25:40.639
BABY SOME SERVICE AND EXEMPTIONS

00:25:40.705 --> 00:25:42.173
TO TO TALK ABOUT.

00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:44.876
AN EXAMPLE -- MY DAUGHTER JUST

00:25:44.943 --> 00:25:47.145
HAD TWINS AND AT THE HIGHS ARE

00:25:47.212 --> 00:25:49.681
IN -- WOODLAND HILLS.

00:25:49.748 --> 00:25:51.583
ANDTHE HAVE A NICK -- UNIT

00:25:51.650 --> 00:25:53.652
THERE BUT THE THE NICK YOU UNITS

00:25:53.718 --> 00:25:55.287
IN THE AREA THAT REALLY TAKES

00:25:55.353 --> 00:25:56.755
CARE OF THE MORE CRITICAL CASES

00:25:56.821 --> 00:25:59.557
AND PANORAMA CITY.

00:25:59.624 --> 00:26:00.759
SELECT -- KINDA MAYBE.

00:26:00.825 --> 00:26:02.193
SENDING PEOPLE MORE TO PANORAMA

00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:03.361
MAYBE DE EMPHASIZING THE

00:26:03.428 --> 00:26:04.829
WOODLAND HILLS SO IF THEY

00:26:04.896 --> 00:26:06.765
DECIDED THAT THEY WANTED TO TAKE

00:26:06.831 --> 00:26:07.999
TO NICK YOU UNITS OUT OF

00:26:08.066 --> 00:26:09.534
WOODLAND HILLS.

00:26:09.601 --> 00:26:11.002
AND TRANSFER THEM TO WEAR THEIR

00:26:11.069 --> 00:26:12.337
PROVIDING MORE COMPREHENSIVE

00:26:12.404 --> 00:26:15.440
NIKKI UNITS AND AND PANORAMA

00:26:15.507 --> 00:26:16.608
CITY ARE YOU SAYING THAT THEY

00:26:16.675 --> 00:26:17.909
WOULD HAVE TO WAIT SIX MONTHS TO

00:26:17.976 --> 00:26:19.077
BE ABLE TO EFFECTUATE ARE GOING

00:26:19.144 --> 00:26:21.146
TO USE THAT EXAMPLE I THINK THE

00:26:21.212 --> 00:26:22.847
ANSWER IS.

00:26:22.914 --> 00:26:24.749
NOT EXACTLY FRANKLY BECAUSE THE

00:26:24.816 --> 00:26:26.618
BILL HAS AN EXEMPTION IN THE

00:26:26.685 --> 00:26:27.819
AMENDMENTS THAT WOULD ALLOW YOU

00:26:27.886 --> 00:26:29.154
TO ADD SO YOU DON'T TO WAIT SIX

00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:30.355
MONTHS TO ADD SO WOODLAND HILLS

00:26:30.422 --> 00:26:32.557
CAN ADD. TWENTY NICK PICKING

00:26:32.624 --> 00:26:34.459
THEIR GOING TO TAKE AWAY TO TO

00:26:34.526 --> 00:26:35.527
ADD.

00:26:35.593 --> 00:26:36.461
TO TWO DIFFERENT FACILITIES

00:26:36.528 --> 00:26:37.495
RIGHT SO THEY'RE TWO DIFFERENT

00:26:37.562 --> 00:26:39.731
LICENSES -- WOODLAND HILLS COULD

00:26:39.798 --> 00:26:43.001
ADD ALL AT ONCE -- THE HANNAH

00:26:43.068 --> 00:26:44.402
AND I'M SORRY IF I MISUNDERSTOOD

00:26:44.469 --> 00:26:47.072
PAN OR THE PANORAMA CITY IS THAT

00:26:47.138 --> 00:26:48.640
IT WOULD WHAT SO WHOEVER'S THE

00:26:48.707 --> 00:26:49.541
WOODLAND IF THEY'RE TAKING AWAY

00:26:49.607 --> 00:26:51.209

00:26:51.276 --> 00:26:52.043
MONTHS.

00:26:52.110 --> 00:26:53.078
BECAUSE OF THE CHANGE AND

00:26:53.144 --> 00:26:55.046

SIX MONTHS TO TAKE THE BEDS OFF

00:26:58.984 --> 00:27:00.318
LINE OUR CONCERN IS IF THEY

00:27:00.385 --> 00:27:04.622

00:27:04.689 --> 00:27:05.724
PICK YOU.

00:27:05.790 --> 00:27:07.258
THAT BOTH ARE A CHANGE THE PICK

YOU COULD BE ADDED THE NICK YOU

00:27:08.059 --> 00:27:08.760

00:28:09.187 --> 00:28:10.555
SIGNIFICANCE OF CHANGES IN

00:28:10.622 --> 00:28:11.389
SERVICES.

00:28:11.456 --> 00:28:13.558
BECAUSE OFTEN TO GET AROUND --

00:28:13.625 --> 00:28:15.326

EDIE'S ARE ICY USE OR MAJOR

00:28:17.629 --> 00:28:19.597
DEPARTMENTS CLOSE BEFORE THE

00:28:19.664 --> 00:28:21.499
FULL HOSPITAL CLOSURE SO I I

00:28:21.566 --> 00:28:22.867
DON'T WANT TO YOU KNOW SAY THAT

00:28:22.934 --> 00:28:24.669
THE AUTHOR IS NOT OPEN AND

00:28:24.736 --> 00:28:25.837
OBVIOUSLY I JUST SPEAK FOR THE

NURSES -- BUT YOU KNOW THIS KIND

00:28:28.473 --> 00:28:30.008
OF SMALLER CHANGES IN SERVICES

00:28:30.075 --> 00:28:31.242
THAT WE'RE DISCUSSING IS

00:28:31.309 --> 00:28:32.844
DEFINITELY KIND OF A REASONABLE

00:28:32.911 --> 00:28:34.245
DISCUSSION BUT THE YOU KNOW

CLOSING ENTIRE DEPARTMENTS.

00:28:37.715 --> 00:28:39.317
I THINK THAT FALLS MORE IN THE

00:28:39.384 --> 00:28:41.186
KIND OF SIGNIFICANT ARENA AND

00:28:41.252 --> 00:28:42.454
YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY CONVERSATIONS

00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:43.855

SCOPE OF THAT LANGUAGE WOULD

00:28:45.090 --> 00:28:46.591
LOOK LIKE BUT I DID WANNA.

00:28:46.658 --> 00:28:48.359

I'M JUST A LITTLE CURIOUS ABOUT

00:28:55.667 --> 00:29:01.372
THE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DAYS.

00:29:01.439 --> 00:29:02.006
WHY THE ONE EIGHTY DAYS I GUESS

00:29:02.073 --> 00:29:02.474
I STRUGGLING TO FIND

00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:03.141

WHEN I'M I CAN SPEAK IN MY

00:29:10.582 --> 00:29:12.283

HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS WELL WHEN

00:29:13.585 --> 00:29:14.953
HOSPITALS IN A CLOSING YOUR PLAN

00:29:15.019 --> 00:29:16.287
FOR EMERGENCY SERVICES WHERE

00:29:16.354 --> 00:29:17.388
THEY GOING TO TAKE THE PATIENTS

00:29:17.455 --> 00:29:18.556
THEY SERVE?

00:29:18.623 --> 00:29:19.757

AND ALSO WHAT YOU REALLY WANT

00:29:23.161 --> 00:29:24.929
THE BEST CASE SCENARIO IS YOU

FIND ANOTHER OPERATOR TO COME IN.

00:29:27.565 --> 00:29:30.034
AND TAKE OVER THE HOSPITAL

00:29:30.101 --> 00:29:30.602
THAT'S WHAT WE SOUGHT TO DO

00:29:30.668 --> 00:29:31.936
HOMAGE TO THE TIMELINE JUST

00:29:32.003 --> 00:29:33.271
WASN'T LONG ENOUGH.

00:29:33.338 --> 00:29:35.874

GET THE ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS

00:29:37.041 --> 00:29:38.510
I MEAN I I DON'T I DON'T THINK

00:29:38.576 --> 00:29:39.477
WE CAN ASK FOR TWO YEARS.

00:29:39.544 --> 00:29:41.246
BUT WE'RE TRYING TO BE

00:29:41.312 --> 00:29:41.980
REASONABLE HERE.

00:29:42.046 --> 00:29:43.181
AT NIGHT COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND

00:29:43.248 --> 00:29:44.516

00:29:47.452 --> 00:29:50.321
BUT I GOT GUESS I'M ALSO

00:29:50.388 --> 00:29:51.089
STRUGGLING.

00:29:51.156 --> 00:29:52.423
THAT WE'RE NOT DEALING WITH THE

00:29:52.490 --> 00:29:53.925
CLOSING OF A HOSPITAL THEN THIS

00:29:53.992 --> 00:29:55.660
BILL ALSO TALKS ABOUT A CHANGE

00:29:55.727 --> 00:29:56.895
IN SERVICE SO.

00:29:56.961 --> 00:29:58.329
WHAT YOU JUST STATED DOESN'T

00:29:58.396 --> 00:30:00.098
REALLY QUITE ADDRESS FOR ME WHY

00:30:00.165 --> 00:30:01.666

IF IT'S TO GIVE YOU KNOW --

00:30:03.334 --> 00:30:05.170
HOSPITALS ENOUGH TIME.

TO YOU KNOW TO FIND AN

00:30:05.737 --> 00:30:06.704
ALTERNATIVE.

00:31:33.691 --> 00:31:36.694
ADDITION IS WHAT I'M CERTAINLY

00:31:36.761 --> 00:31:38.496

00:31:42.934 --> 00:31:44.469
LEVEL ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE

00:31:44.535 --> 00:31:46.104
SERVICES FOR OUR PATIENTS AS

00:31:46.170 --> 00:31:47.972
NURSES AND WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT A

00:31:48.039 --> 00:31:49.407
HOSPITAL CLOSURE YOU'RE TALKING

00:31:49.474 --> 00:31:51.042
ABOUT THE COMMUNITY NOT HAVING

00:31:51.109 --> 00:31:52.744
ACCESS TO BASIC SERVICES WHICH A

00:31:52.810 --> 00:31:54.679
DECREASE IN SERVICES FALLS

00:31:54.746 --> 00:31:55.246
WITHIN THAT.

00:31:55.313 --> 00:31:57.215
AND WHAT WE PREDOMINATELY SEE IT

00:31:57.282 --> 00:31:59.017
IS THESE GHOST CLOSURES WHERE

00:31:59.083 --> 00:32:00.018
THEY'RE CLOSING LARGE

00:32:00.084 --> 00:32:00.852
DEPARTMENTS ARE CUTTING

00:32:00.918 --> 00:32:02.954
DEPARTMENTS AND HALF AND THAT

00:32:03.021 --> 00:32:04.756

AS YOU'RE.

00:32:07.025 --> 00:32:08.826
WELL AWARE -- YOU KNOW I THINK

00:32:08.893 --> 00:32:09.927
AS WE'VE DISCUSSED PREVIOUSLY

00:32:09.994 --> 00:32:11.963
WERE OPEN TO WHEN THERE'SMORE

00:32:12.030 --> 00:32:14.065
MINUTE CHANGES ANA DEPARTMENT

00:32:14.132 --> 00:32:15.366
WHEN THEY'RE LOOKING AT LOWERING

00:32:15.433 --> 00:32:16.567
BY ONLY A FEW BAD.

00:32:16.634 --> 00:32:18.369
THRESHOLD -- THAT THAT'S SOME

00:32:18.436 --> 00:32:19.771
LANGUAGE WERE WILLING TO LOOK AT

00:32:19.837 --> 00:32:21.839
MOVING FORWARD BUT WE FEEL THAT

00:32:21.906 --> 00:32:23.841
LARGE SCALE CHANGES -- EVEN IF

00:32:23.908 --> 00:32:24.442
IT IS ONLY WITHIN A COUPLE

00:32:24.509 --> 00:32:26.411
DEPARTMENTS IS JUST AS IMPORTANT

00:32:26.477 --> 00:32:29.247
TO THE COMMUNITY AS IF THEY ARE

00:32:29.314 --> 00:32:29.781
TRYING TO CLOSE THE WHOLE

00:32:29.847 --> 00:32:31.416
FACILITY.

00:32:31.482 --> 00:32:32.684
SO I KNOWLEDGE AS SOMETHING I

00:32:32.750 --> 00:32:33.418
JUST HEARD RIGHT NOW AS WELL.

00:32:33.484 --> 00:32:35.086
WHEN YOU HAVE A HUNDRED AND

00:32:35.153 --> 00:32:36.087
EIGHTY DAYS?

00:32:36.154 --> 00:32:38.323
MY FEAR IN TERMS OF PROVIDING

00:32:38.389 --> 00:32:40.224
SERVICES AND I THINK SOMEONE

00:32:40.291 --> 00:32:41.826
EXPRESS SAID YOU KNOW WHEN

00:32:41.893 --> 00:32:43.461
PEOPLE KNOW THAT FROM THERE

00:32:43.528 --> 00:32:44.896
THEIR JOB IS GOING TO CLOSE

00:32:44.962 --> 00:32:45.730
WHETHER IT'S A HOSPITAL OR

00:32:45.797 --> 00:32:46.764
ANYTHING ELSE.

00:32:46.831 --> 00:32:47.799
THEY START LOOKING FOR ANOTHER

00:32:47.865 --> 00:32:49.934
JOB SO WHAT HAPPENS WITH NURSES

00:32:50.001 --> 00:32:51.703
AND OTHER YOU KNOW PROVIDERS

00:32:51.769 --> 00:32:53.971
DECIDE TO FIND ANOTHER JOB WHAT

00:32:54.038 --> 00:32:56.341
HAPPENS THEN.

00:32:56.407 --> 00:32:58.843
US SO SPEAKING FOR THE NURSES --

00:32:58.910 --> 00:32:59.711
OUR EXPERIENCE AT HOSPITALS AS

00:32:59.777 --> 00:33:00.745
THEY HAVE DO NOT HAVE A HARD

00:33:00.812 --> 00:33:03.147
TIME FINDING STAFFING WHEN

00:33:03.214 --> 00:33:04.682
THERE'S A SHORTAGE OF WORKERS.

00:33:04.749 --> 00:33:05.717
FOR DIFFERENT REASONS THEY HAVE

00:33:05.783 --> 00:33:07.285
ACCESS TO ALL SORTS OF DIFFERENT

00:33:07.352 --> 00:33:09.187
AGENCIES AND GROUPS THAT THEY

00:33:09.253 --> 00:33:11.289
USE ALSO THE PREDOMINATELY WHEN

00:33:11.356 --> 00:33:12.657
HOSPITALS ARE PLANNING CLOSER IS

00:33:12.724 --> 00:33:13.925
AN ATTRITION PLAN.

00:33:13.991 --> 00:33:15.393
NORMALLY PUT IN PLACE THEY MAKE

00:33:15.460 --> 00:33:16.994
A PLAN FOR WE ARE GOING TO LOSE

00:33:17.061 --> 00:33:18.730
SOME PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE --

00:33:18.796 --> 00:33:20.698
WHICH IS NOT NECESSARILY A BAD

00:33:20.765 --> 00:33:21.432
THING YOU DON'T WANT ALL THE

00:33:21.499 --> 00:33:23.901
WORKERS TRAPPED WITHOUT A JOB --

00:33:23.968 --> 00:33:24.702
WHICH IS WHAT HAPPENS UNDER

00:33:24.769 --> 00:33:26.137
CURRENT LAW WITH ONLY THE THIRTY

00:33:26.204 --> 00:33:28.005
DAYS NOTICE IF A HOSPITAL

00:33:28.072 --> 00:33:28.539
DOESN'T HAVE AN EMERGENCY

00:33:28.606 --> 00:33:29.974
DEPARTMENT IT'S VERY DIFFICULT

00:33:30.041 --> 00:33:32.543
TO FIND NEW EMPLOYMENT IN LESS

00:33:32.610 --> 00:33:34.812
THAN THIRTY DAYS -- SO WE THINK

00:33:34.879 --> 00:33:37.648
IT'S VIRTUOUS AND WE DON'T THINK

00:33:37.715 --> 00:33:39.083
THE HOSPITALS WILL HAVE A HUGE

00:33:39.150 --> 00:33:40.852
PROBLEM FINING PEOPLE IF THEY DO

00:33:40.918 --> 00:33:42.553
DPH HAS THE AUTHORITY TO COME IN.

00:33:42.620 --> 00:33:43.688
AND CLOSE SPECIFIC DEPARTMENTS

00:33:43.755 --> 00:33:45.823
OR THE WHOLE FACILITY BEFORE THE

00:33:45.890 --> 00:33:47.125
HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DAYS SO IT'S

00:33:47.191 --> 00:33:48.493
NOT THAT HOSPITALS WILL BE.

00:33:48.559 --> 00:33:50.027
COMPLETELY JUST YOU KNOW

00:33:50.094 --> 00:33:52.730
OPERATING WITH NOBODY -- ON

00:33:52.797 --> 00:33:54.031
STAFF.

00:33:54.098 --> 00:33:54.799
BUT AND I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE

00:33:54.866 --> 00:33:56.901
SAYING BUT AT THIS POINT YOUR

00:33:56.968 --> 00:33:58.703
YOUR YOU'RE SAYING THAT THEY CAN

00:33:58.770 --> 00:34:00.071
GET TEMPORARY WORKERS TO FILL

00:34:00.138 --> 00:34:01.806
THE THE GAP BETWEEN BUT YOU KNOW

00:34:01.873 --> 00:34:03.141
WHENEVER SOMEONE LEAVES TO THE

00:34:03.207 --> 00:34:04.475
END OF THE ONE EIGHTY DAIS IS

00:34:04.542 --> 00:34:05.476
THAT WHAT I'M HEARING.

00:34:05.543 --> 00:34:06.544
WELL IF I IF I COULD MISTER

00:34:06.611 --> 00:34:07.445
CHAIR I CAN ONLY SPEAK TO MY OWN

00:34:07.512 --> 00:34:08.746
EXPERIENCE OF LONG BEACH AND IF

00:34:08.813 --> 00:34:10.515
I UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY DID

00:34:10.581 --> 00:34:14.185
CORRECTLY -- WAS THE INCENTIVIZE.

00:34:14.252 --> 00:34:15.520
THE NURSES TO STAY ON FOR A

00:34:15.586 --> 00:34:16.654
CERTAIN PERIOD OF TIME THERE WAS

00:34:16.721 --> 00:34:17.989
A FINANCIAL INCENTIVE FOR THEM

00:34:18.055 --> 00:34:20.158
TO STAY ON FOR AGAIN A

00:34:20.224 --> 00:34:21.492
DESIGNATED PERIOD OF TIME SO THE

00:34:21.559 --> 00:34:22.727
HOSPITAL COULD SUSTAIN

00:34:22.794 --> 00:34:25.229
OPERATIONS.

00:34:25.296 --> 00:34:27.365
AND WELL LET ME JUST FINISH THE

00:34:27.432 --> 00:34:28.232
THOUGHT OKAY BECAUSE YOU KNOW

00:34:28.299 --> 00:34:29.600
EARLIERI HEARD YOU SAY THAT YES

00:34:29.667 --> 00:34:30.568
THAT THERE'S A DEPARTMENTS THAT

00:34:30.635 --> 00:34:32.170
HAVE UP AND PLAY THAT THEY COULD

00:34:32.236 --> 00:34:33.304
COME IN A FULL FILL THAT VOID

00:34:33.371 --> 00:34:34.839
YOU KNOW BUT BUT AGAIN WE'RE

00:34:34.906 --> 00:34:37.508
TALKING ABOUT QUALITY SERVICE.

00:34:37.575 --> 00:34:39.177
I MEAN I HAVE TO BELIEVE THAT IF

00:34:39.243 --> 00:34:40.211
YOU DON'T HAVE THE STAFF THAT

00:34:40.278 --> 00:34:41.712
YOU'RE NORMALLY HAVE ON A NORMAL

00:34:41.779 --> 00:34:43.381
BASIS AND YOU HAVE PEOPLE IN AND

00:34:43.448 --> 00:34:45.716
OUT. TO ME THAT DIMINISHES THE

00:34:45.783 --> 00:34:47.452
QUALITY OF SERVICE FOR FOR ANY

00:34:47.518 --> 00:34:48.319
PATIENT.

00:34:48.386 --> 00:34:49.220
WITH YOU KNOW IF YOU WANT TO

00:34:49.287 --> 00:34:50.721
BRING TEMPORARY WORKERS I DON'T

00:34:50.788 --> 00:34:53.057
THINK THAT IS FOR ME THE BEST

00:34:53.124 --> 00:34:55.693
OPTION TO PROVIDE BETTER CARE TO

00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:57.195
ME THAT'S DIMINISH SERVICES AND

00:34:57.261 --> 00:34:58.296
DIMINISH CARE.

00:34:58.362 --> 00:34:59.997
SO AGAIN I'M I'M REALLY

00:35:00.064 --> 00:35:01.999
STRUGGLING TO UNDERSTAND HOW A

00:35:02.066 --> 00:35:03.301
HOSPITAL THAT.

00:35:03.367 --> 00:35:04.302
ALREADY OPERATING IN THE RED

00:35:04.368 --> 00:35:05.770
WILL BE ABLE TO FILL THAT

00:35:05.837 --> 00:35:07.538
DEFICIENCY IN AND AGAIN IF

00:35:07.605 --> 00:35:08.539
NURSES ARE LEAVING A

00:35:08.606 --> 00:35:09.607
PROFESSIONALS UP IN THE FALL

00:35:09.674 --> 00:35:10.775
LONG TIME.

00:35:10.842 --> 00:35:12.376
I DO BELIEVE PERSONALLY THAT

00:35:12.443 --> 00:35:13.744
YOU'RE NOT GETTING THE BEST

00:35:13.811 --> 00:35:15.546
PEOPLE THAT KNOW THE SYSTEM THAT

00:35:15.613 --> 00:35:16.814
NO THE COMMUNITY THAT KNOW THE

00:35:16.881 --> 00:35:18.449
PATIENTS. TO ME IT'S STILL

00:35:18.516 --> 00:35:19.917
DIMINISH QUALITY OF CARE I'LL

00:35:19.984 --> 00:35:21.118
BUT THAT'S JUST MY PERSONAL DIED

00:35:21.185 --> 00:35:22.620
IN WHEN I'M STRUGGLING WITH BUT

00:35:22.687 --> 00:35:24.755
I ALSO RESEARCHED YOU KNOW OTHER

00:35:24.822 --> 00:35:26.190
STATES THAT HAVE.

00:35:26.257 --> 00:35:27.692
YOU KNOW THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE

00:35:27.758 --> 00:35:30.628
AND THEIR SIX STATES THAT HAVE --

00:35:30.695 --> 00:35:33.631
I BELIEVE IT SIXTY DAYS NOTICE.

00:35:33.698 --> 00:35:34.699
SIX STATES IN THE UNITED STATES

00:35:34.765 --> 00:35:36.934
AND ONLY TO HAVE NINETY DAYS

00:35:37.001 --> 00:35:38.269
WERE ONE OF THEM ALREADY SO

00:35:38.336 --> 00:35:39.871
WE'RE ONE OF THE MOST AGGRESSIVE

00:35:39.937 --> 00:35:41.539
IN TERMS OF NOTIFICATION.

00:35:41.606 --> 00:35:43.508
AND WE WOULD BE THE FIRST ONES

00:35:43.574 --> 00:35:44.876
TO GO A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DAYS

00:35:44.942 --> 00:35:46.210
SO I JUST.

00:35:46.277 --> 00:35:49.814
AGAIN THE ONE EIGHTY DAYS TO ME

WITH THE NINE ELEVEN TRAGEDY

00:38:45.956 --> 00:38:46.724
THAT.

00:38:46.791 --> 00:38:47.992
YEARS LATER IS MONTHS LATER

00:38:48.059 --> 00:38:49.527

FROM THAT FIRE AND THEY'RE

00:38:59.737 --> 00:39:01.539
HAVING TO NEED EMERGENCY

00:39:01.605 --> 00:39:09.280
SERVICES AND CREATE MAYBE AT

00:39:09.346 --> 00:39:10.848
DEPARTMENT HANDLES THAT.

00:39:10.915 --> 00:39:11.482

LEVEL OKAY SO WHAT IF.

00:39:16.053 --> 00:39:16.554
HOSPITAL DOESN'T HAVE ENOUGH

00:39:16.620 --> 00:39:17.154
RESOURCES AND THEY NEEDED TO

00:39:17.221 --> 00:39:17.655
TAKE RESOURCES FROM ONE

00:39:17.722 --> 00:39:19.156
DEPARTMENT SO THEY CAN CREATE

00:39:19.223 --> 00:39:20.624
THIS OTHER DEPARTMENT THAT'S

00:39:20.691 --> 00:39:21.992

THAT'S WHAT WE SPOKE ABOUT

00:39:27.198 --> 00:39:28.032
EARLIER WITH A CHANGE IN

00:39:28.099 --> 00:39:29.433
SERVICES PROVISION COULD

00:39:29.500 --> 00:39:30.968
POTENTIALLY USE FURTHER

00:39:31.035 --> 00:39:36.540
REFINEMENT AND I'M QUITE OPEN.

00:39:36.607 --> 00:39:37.274

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT WHICH IS.

00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:51.255

HOSPITALS HAVE AN EMERGENCY

00:39:52.423 --> 00:39:54.525
AROUND -- AND I WOULD ALSO NOTE

00:39:54.592 --> 00:39:56.060
THAT NEW YORK HAS NINETY DAYS

00:39:56.127 --> 00:39:58.062

00:41:39.296 --> 00:41:40.331
AND FOR A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY

00:41:40.397 --> 00:41:41.799
DAYS YOU HAVE TO KEEP IT OPEN

00:41:41.866 --> 00:41:42.399
AND YOU HAVE TO MEET STAFFING

00:41:42.466 --> 00:41:43.267
RATIOS.

00:41:43.334 --> 00:41:44.468
AND YOU HAVE TO MEET ONE TO ONE

00:41:44.535 --> 00:41:45.502
CARE AT NIGHT YOU HAVE TO MEET

00:41:45.569 --> 00:41:47.371
ALL THESE REQUIREMENTS AND YOUR

00:41:47.438 --> 00:41:48.772
STAFF IS FLEEING.

00:41:48.839 --> 00:41:49.740
BECAUSE THEY KNOW THEY'RE GONNA

00:41:49.807 --> 00:41:51.008
LOSE THEIR JOB AND THEY NEED TO

00:41:51.075 --> 00:41:52.443
GO GET ANOTHER JOB BECAUSE THEY

00:41:52.509 --> 00:41:54.011
HAVE FAMILIES AND THEY HAVE --

00:41:54.078 --> 00:41:55.446
STUFF THEY HAVE TO TAKECARE OF

00:41:55.512 --> 00:41:57.381
THEY CAN'T BE OUT OF A JOB I GET

00:41:57.448 --> 00:41:58.716
THAT RIGHT SO.

00:41:58.782 --> 00:42:00.351
IF THEY LEAVE A 50% OF YOUR

00:42:00.417 --> 00:42:02.152
NURSES HERE THE HOSPITAL CLOSER

00:42:02.219 --> 00:42:04.288
OR MEDICAL PROVIDERS AND THEY

00:42:04.355 --> 00:42:07.024
LEAVE TO GO FIND CONTRACTS OR

00:42:07.091 --> 00:42:08.659
JOBS AT OTHER HOSPITALS.

00:42:08.726 --> 00:42:09.326
HOW DO YOU MEET STAFFING RATIOS?

00:42:09.393 --> 00:42:11.362
HOW DO YOU?

00:42:11.428 --> 00:42:12.997
HAVE USED TO PROVIDE CARE TO THE

00:42:13.063 --> 00:42:14.765
COMMUNITY FOR THAT HUNDRED AND

00:42:14.832 --> 00:42:15.566
EIGHTY DAYS.

00:42:15.633 --> 00:42:18.068
AND IS THERE ANY REQUIREMENT

00:42:18.135 --> 00:42:19.937
THAT REQUIRES NURSING AND PEOPLE

00:42:20.004 --> 00:42:22.673
THAT PROVIDE THAT QUALITY CARE

00:42:22.740 --> 00:42:23.774
TO THE COMMUNITY.

00:42:23.841 --> 00:42:26.343
THAT THEY STAY THE LAST DAY TELL

00:42:26.410 --> 00:42:27.511
I MEAN I'M JUST ASKING LIKE HOW

00:42:27.578 --> 00:42:28.812
DO YOU FULFILL THE OBLIGATIONS

00:42:28.879 --> 00:42:30.147
OF PROVIDING SERVICES THE

00:42:30.214 --> 00:42:31.048
COMMUNITY.

00:42:31.115 --> 00:42:33.784
WHEN YOU LOSE YOUR STAFF AND I

00:42:33.851 --> 00:42:35.786
AM GET A STEAMER STAFFING I WITH

00:42:35.853 --> 00:42:37.354
THE TULARE CLOSER THERE IS NO

00:42:37.421 --> 00:42:39.890
WAY?

00:42:39.957 --> 00:42:40.491
IN HELL I WANT TO TRY AND SAY

00:42:40.557 --> 00:42:41.091
THAT BUT I WILL CHOOSE FROM.

00:42:41.158 --> 00:42:42.226
STOPPING UNFORTUNATELY -- WE

00:42:42.293 --> 00:42:43.294
WOULD USE TEMPORARY STAFFING

00:42:43.360 --> 00:42:48.098
LIKELY IN THIS CASE -- AND THEN

00:42:48.165 --> 00:42:49.233
I THINK AT THAT POINT WHEN WE

00:42:49.300 --> 00:42:50.501
CAN WHEN WE CAN TALK WITH CITY

00:42:50.567 --> 00:42:51.201
PATIENTS A WE JUST CAN'T MEET

00:42:51.268 --> 00:42:52.703
THE STAFFING REQUIREMENTS WE

00:42:52.770 --> 00:42:54.405
WOULD THEN ENGAGE CD PAGE AND

00:42:54.471 --> 00:42:56.640
THAT -- CONVERSATION THEY HAVE

00:42:56.707 --> 00:42:58.208
THE AUTHORITY TO DETERMINE

00:42:58.275 --> 00:43:00.244
WHETHER WERE PROVIDING SAFE CARE

00:43:00.311 --> 00:43:01.445
ANYMORE AND THEN I THINK THAT'S

00:43:01.512 --> 00:43:02.079
THE CORRECT TERMINOLOGY ON THE

00:43:02.146 --> 00:43:03.314
STATUE IN FRONT OF ME BUT THEY

00:43:03.380 --> 00:43:04.515
CAN COME IN.

00:43:04.581 --> 00:43:06.483
AND DETERMINE -- THAT THE

00:43:06.550 --> 00:43:08.252
HOSPITAL IS UNABLE TO PROVIDE

00:43:08.319 --> 00:43:10.854
THAT SERVICE -- ANYMORE AND THEY

00:43:10.921 --> 00:43:12.423
THEY WOULD THEN HAVE TO DRUM AND

00:43:12.489 --> 00:43:14.124
EARLIER THAN THE SIX MONTHS --

00:43:14.191 --> 00:43:15.592
BUT THAT WOULD BE A CD PHP

00:43:15.659 --> 00:43:16.961
TERMINATION THAT'S NOT A SELF

00:43:17.027 --> 00:43:18.963
DETERMINATION OF THIS BILL WE

00:43:19.029 --> 00:43:20.064
HAVE TO GIVE THE NOTICE.

00:43:20.130 --> 00:43:22.132
THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE

00:43:22.199 --> 00:43:24.301
PROCESS SO WE WOULD I WOULD HAVE

00:43:24.368 --> 00:43:25.302
TO BE DETERMINED THAT OUR STATE

00:43:25.369 --> 00:43:27.805
OR CARE IS UNSAFE WHICH IS NOT

00:43:27.871 --> 00:43:28.872
SOMETHING.

00:43:28.939 --> 00:43:29.440
WE EVER REALLY WANT TO HAVE

00:43:29.506 --> 00:43:30.107
HAPPEN.

00:43:30.174 --> 00:43:31.775
NO WHEN I UNDERSTAND THAT BUT I

00:43:31.842 --> 00:43:34.578
I DON'T SEE -- I DON'T SEE I

00:43:34.645 --> 00:43:36.347
DON'T ON THE GROUND I KNOW WE DO

00:43:36.413 --> 00:43:37.014
THINGS IN THIS BUILDING WHERE WE

00:43:37.081 --> 00:43:38.015
THINK.

00:43:38.082 --> 00:43:39.683
YOU KNOW THIS SOUNDS GOOD UP

00:43:39.750 --> 00:43:41.952
HERE YOU KNOW AN EXAMPLE 1100%

00:43:42.019 --> 00:43:44.221
CLEAN AIR WE ALL WANT CLEAN AIR.

00:43:44.288 --> 00:43:46.590
BUT TO ACHIEVE ON THE GROUND

00:43:46.657 --> 00:43:48.325
WHEN A PERSON CLEANERS ALMOST

00:43:48.392 --> 00:43:48.959
IMPOSSIBLE ANALYSTS TO SEPARATE

00:43:49.026 --> 00:43:49.727
SUBJECT.

00:43:49.793 --> 00:43:51.395
SO I GET THAT WE WANT TO MAKE

00:43:51.462 --> 00:43:52.429
SURE THAT IF HOSPITALS NOT

00:43:52.496 --> 00:43:53.664
FINANCIALLY VIABLE.

00:43:53.731 --> 00:43:55.099
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE NURSES HAVE

00:43:55.165 --> 00:43:56.166
OPPORTUNITY GO TO ANOTHER

00:43:56.233 --> 00:43:57.935
HOSPITAL A LOT OF TIMES THEY MAY

00:43:58.002 --> 00:43:59.436
HAVE TO RELOCATE THEIR FAMILIES

00:43:59.503 --> 00:44:00.738
THEY MAY HAVE TO MOVE.

00:44:00.804 --> 00:44:02.172
AND THEY MAY BE THE ONLY SOLE

00:44:02.239 --> 00:44:04.842
PROVIDER AND SO I GET THAT I

00:44:04.908 --> 00:44:06.210
UNDERSTAND WHERE THAN THE CARD

00:44:06.276 --> 00:44:09.446
THAT THE PART OF THE BILL THAT'S

00:44:09.513 --> 00:44:09.813
COMING FORWARD.

00:44:09.880 --> 00:44:10.647
WHAT DOESN'T OPERATE ON THE

00:44:10.714 --> 00:44:13.083
GROUND IS THE REQUIREMENTS FOR

00:44:13.150 --> 00:44:14.852

IMPORTANT TO THE CENTRAL VALLEY

00:46:41.598 --> 00:46:43.667
RURAL CALIFORNIA I WANT TO MAKE

00:46:43.734 --> 00:46:45.969

HOSPITALS THAT ARE THERE THAT

00:46:52.309 --> 00:46:55.712
THE REMAIN OPEN AND OBVIOUSLY

00:46:55.779 --> 00:46:58.448
THE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE OF IT

00:46:58.515 --> 00:47:02.486
IT JUST DEVASTATES A COMMUNITY.

00:47:02.553 --> 00:47:03.887
ARE.

00:47:03.954 --> 00:47:04.922
EIGHT VERY IN A VERY BAD WAY ALL

TO THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS TO

00:47:09.393 --> 00:47:10.827
EVERYTHING THE SERVICES ARE

FEEL THAT WE'VE HAD THE MOST

00:47:17.768 --> 00:47:19.303
AMOUNT WELL WE I KNOW THAT WE

00:47:19.369 --> 00:47:20.671
HAVE THE MOST AMOUNT OF HOSPITAL

00:47:20.737 --> 00:47:22.105
CLOSURES.

ACROSS THE STATE.

00:47:23.707 --> 00:47:25.242
SO I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

00:47:25.309 --> 00:47:27.110
HOW THIS BILL.

00:47:27.177 --> 00:47:28.912
YOU KNOW WOULD HELP PREVENT THAT

00:47:28.979 --> 00:47:31.982
IN THE FUTURE -- BUT YOU KNOW I

00:47:32.049 --> 00:47:33.450
ALSO.

00:47:35.118 --> 00:47:37.588
SOME CONCERNS -- I KNOW THAT I

00:47:37.654 --> 00:47:39.089

AND THEY WENT.

00:47:47.297 --> 00:47:48.265
SO THEY RELIED THEIR SOURCE

00:47:48.332 --> 00:47:49.800
THEIR MAIN SOURCE OF INCOME CAME

00:47:49.866 --> 00:47:51.368
FROM THE PRESENT AND SO WHAT

00:47:51.435 --> 00:47:52.769

00:48:08.518 --> 00:48:10.887
WE CAN'T AFFORD TO KEEP GOING

THAT'S LEFT WITHOUT ACCESS TO

00:48:17.694 --> 00:48:19.496

WHAT'S OCCURRED.

00:49:34.137 --> 00:49:35.172
HISTORICALLY IN THE CENTRAL

00:49:35.238 --> 00:49:38.508
VALLEY I CANNOT I I BRING MY

00:49:38.575 --> 00:49:39.176

WHICH WAS -- IT WAS ANNOUNCED A

00:49:41.445 --> 00:49:43.180
HOSPITALS CLOSING THEN THAT

00:49:43.246 --> 00:49:44.881
HOSPITAL CLOSURE WAS RAPIDLY

00:49:44.948 --> 00:49:46.750
EXPEDITED.

00:49:46.817 --> 00:49:48.952
AND IT HAD SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS

00:49:49.019 --> 00:49:51.488
ON THE FACT GIVEN THE FACT THAT

00:49:51.555 --> 00:49:51.988
WE WERE LEFT WITHOUT AN

00:49:52.055 --> 00:49:53.023
EMERGENCY ROOM.

00:49:53.090 --> 00:49:54.024

OTHER AREA HOSPITALS?

00:49:57.260 --> 00:49:59.596
AND THE WHOLE -- FOR FOR A FIRE

00:49:59.663 --> 00:50:00.897
DEPARTMENT NOW WHERE WHERE THEY

00:50:00.964 --> 00:50:02.399
TAKE PATIENTS SO IT BACKS UP.

00:50:02.466 --> 00:50:03.734
YOU KNOW THERE TIMELINE TO

00:50:07.070 --> 00:50:08.238
TO DO HERE TODAY IS TO HAVE A

00:50:08.305 --> 00:50:09.473
COMMUNITY MORE.

00:50:09.539 --> 00:50:11.475
NOTICE SO THAT THEY CAN BE

00:50:11.541 --> 00:50:13.243
PREPARED FOR WHEN A HOSPITAL

00:50:13.310 --> 00:50:14.945
DOES CLOSE AND THAT MEANS MAYBE

00:50:15.011 --> 00:50:16.513
FINDING ANOTHER OPERATOR THAT'S

00:50:16.580 --> 00:50:17.581
TYPICALLY THE HOLY GRAIL.

00:50:17.647 --> 00:50:19.116
IT DOESN'T ALWAYS HAPPEN FOR

00:50:19.182 --> 00:50:20.517
SURE WE CAN'T GUARANTEE THAT BUT

00:50:20.584 --> 00:50:22.018
AGAIN TO FOR COMMUNITY

00:50:22.085 --> 00:50:23.353
ESPECIALLY ON EMERGENCY SERVICES

00:50:23.420 --> 00:50:26.556
SIDE TO BE ABLE TO PLAN. FOR

00:50:26.623 --> 00:50:29.826
WHEN THAT OCCURS -- CENTER ST

00:50:29.893 --> 00:50:31.128
FAQ FROM MISTER CHAIR I'D

00:50:31.194 --> 00:50:32.763
APPRECIATE -- SENATOR RUBIO AS

00:50:32.829 --> 00:50:34.965
RESEARCH ON THIS AS FAR AS THE

00:50:35.031 --> 00:50:36.400
NINETY DAYS CATHARINE THAT OTHER

00:50:36.466 --> 00:50:39.302
STATES -- EMPLOYEE WHICH SEEMS

00:50:39.369 --> 00:50:42.005
TO BE WORKING -- AND AND I THINK

00:50:42.072 --> 00:50:43.340
THAT WHAT THE AUTHOR AND THE

00:50:43.407 --> 00:50:45.575
SPONSORS -- OR TRYING TO DO IS

00:50:45.642 --> 00:50:47.077
IS IS IS NOBLE.

00:50:47.144 --> 00:50:48.412
AND I THINK IT PROBABLY WOULD

00:50:48.478 --> 00:50:50.147
WORK BETTER IN LARGER

00:50:50.213 --> 00:50:52.149
METROPOLITAN AREAS WHEN YOU HAVE

00:50:52.215 --> 00:50:53.450
A HOSPITAL LIKE.

00:50:53.517 --> 00:50:54.885
CEDAR SINAI HOSPITAL IN LOS

00:50:54.951 --> 00:50:56.686
ANGELES THAT HAS THE MULTI

00:50:56.753 --> 00:50:59.489
DISCIPLINARY APPROACH.

00:50:59.556 --> 00:51:02.325
TO PSYCHIATRY SURGERY -- BE YOU

00:51:02.392 --> 00:51:04.060
KNOW AIDS CARE.

00:51:04.127 --> 00:51:05.529
THEY THEY HAVE ALL THE SERVICES

00:51:05.595 --> 00:51:06.096
NOW I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE

00:51:06.163 --> 00:51:07.831
SEEING THIS IN THE RURAL AREAS

00:51:07.898 --> 00:51:09.633
OUTSIDE OF WHERE I'M FROM BUT IN

00:51:09.699 --> 00:51:11.268
THE TO MACULAR VALLEY -- WE

00:51:11.334 --> 00:51:13.703
OFTEN HOUSE HOSPITALS THAT ARE

00:51:13.770 --> 00:51:15.238
OWNED BY THE SAME ENTITY SO AS

00:51:15.305 --> 00:51:16.606
AN EXAMPLE WE HAVE TO MAKE IT

00:51:16.673 --> 00:51:18.675
ABOUT A HOSPITAL WHERE FRENCH

00:51:18.742 --> 00:51:19.443
SPRINGS HOSPITAL.

00:51:19.509 --> 00:51:21.578
BOB THEY CATER TO ABOUT.

00:51:21.645 --> 00:51:22.779
HALF A MILLION PEOPLE AND THE

00:51:22.846 --> 00:51:24.147
CHEMICAL RALLY.

00:51:24.214 --> 00:51:25.749
AND THEY HAVE FOUND AN ECONOMY

00:51:25.816 --> 00:51:27.384
OF SCALE THAT IF YOU HAVE ONE

00:51:27.451 --> 00:51:29.519
HOSPITAL THAT SPECIALIZES IN NYC

00:51:29.586 --> 00:51:30.454
YOU.

00:51:30.520 --> 00:51:31.888
AND YOU HAVE ONE HOSPITAL THAT

00:51:31.955 --> 00:51:33.657
SPECIALIZES IN CARDIOVASCULAR

00:51:33.723 --> 00:51:36.460
DISEASE -- THAT THAT'S BETTER

00:51:36.526 --> 00:51:37.961
FOR THE PATIENT AND IT'S MORE

00:51:38.028 --> 00:51:39.396
ECONOMICAL FOR A HOSPITAL THESE

00:51:39.463 --> 00:51:40.997
VERY CHALLENGING ECONOMIC TIMES

00:51:41.064 --> 00:51:42.699
TO DELIVER THOSE SERVICES AND

00:51:42.766 --> 00:51:44.134
THAT ACTUALLY DID HAPPEN. TO

00:51:44.201 --> 00:51:45.202
MAKE IT ABOUT A HOSPITAL'S A NEW

00:51:45.268 --> 00:51:46.937
HOSPITAL'S BEEN IN OUR AREA FOR

00:51:47.003 --> 00:51:48.238
ABOUT FIVE OR SIX YEARS.

00:51:48.305 --> 00:51:49.506
AND THEY HAVE DECIDED THEY'RE

00:51:49.573 --> 00:51:50.874
SPECIALIZING NOW AND

00:51:50.941 --> 00:51:52.576
CARDIOVASCULAR HEALTH STROKE

00:51:52.642 --> 00:51:53.977
HEART ATTACK VICTIMS AND THE DE

00:51:54.044 --> 00:51:55.679
EMPHASIZE.

00:51:55.745 --> 00:51:57.647
THEIR THEIR BEATNIK YOU THEY

00:51:57.714 --> 00:51:58.949
DON'T WANT TO HAVE HAPPEN IF YOU

00:51:59.015 --> 00:52:00.116
UNIT THERE ANYMORE THEY'VE

00:52:00.183 --> 00:52:01.718
CLOSED DOWN IN A BOOTH AT

00:52:01.785 --> 00:52:02.519
TORRENTIAL SPRINGS WHICH IS.

00:52:02.586 --> 00:52:05.322
A FIFTEEN MINUTE DRIVE TWENTY

00:52:05.388 --> 00:52:06.656
MINUTES WHAT WHAT WHAT WITH

00:52:06.723 --> 00:52:09.493
TRAFFIC.

00:52:09.559 --> 00:52:11.595
SO -- IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE.

00:52:11.661 --> 00:52:13.029
THERE'S NO LOSS OF SERVICE TO

00:52:13.096 --> 00:52:14.197
THE AREA REALLY.

00:52:14.264 --> 00:52:15.832
AND THERE'S NO LOSS OF JOBS FOR

00:52:15.899 --> 00:52:16.633
THE NURSES WHICH I THINK IS

00:52:16.700 --> 00:52:18.935
PROBABLY A PRIMARY CONCERN -- AS

00:52:19.002 --> 00:52:19.536
TO WHY YOU'RE SPONSORING THIS

00:52:19.603 --> 00:52:20.337
BILL.

00:52:20.403 --> 00:52:22.372
AND SO WHEN YOU HAVE THESE KIND

00:52:22.439 --> 00:52:24.174
OF SCENARIOS WERE THE IT'S A

00:52:24.241 --> 00:52:25.609
ZERO SUM GAME BUT THE AREAS

00:52:25.675 --> 00:52:26.977
GETTING A BETTER SERVICE AND

00:52:27.043 --> 00:52:28.345
PROVIDING YOU KNOW MORE

00:52:28.411 --> 00:52:29.846
COMPREHENSIVE HEALTH CARE.

00:52:29.913 --> 00:52:31.882
IN SPECIALIZED WAY IT SEEMS TO

00:52:31.948 --> 00:52:33.250
ME THAT THERE'S GOTTA BE A

00:52:33.316 --> 00:52:34.684
MODALITY TO ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN

00:52:34.751 --> 00:52:36.520
UNDER YOUR BILL FOR YOUR FOR

00:52:36.586 --> 00:52:38.121
YOUR CONSIDERATION I ONE HUNDRED

00:52:38.188 --> 00:52:39.523
IF YOUR COMMENT ON SOME OF THE

00:52:39.589 --> 00:52:41.024
SPECIALTIES IN THE SMALLER -- A

00:52:41.091 --> 00:52:43.093
RULER IS LIKE I REPRESENTS SOME

00:52:43.159 --> 00:52:45.428
OF THE RURAL AREAS LIFE HOSPITAL.

00:52:45.495 --> 00:52:47.197
YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S A TWO TWO

00:52:47.264 --> 00:52:48.031
HOURS FROM THE QUOTE FROM FAR

00:52:48.098 --> 00:52:50.734
FROM PALM DESERT OR PALM SPRINGS

00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:53.970
AND THESE THESE PEOPLE HAVE

00:52:54.037 --> 00:52:55.138
LIMITED CHOICES.

00:52:55.205 --> 00:52:55.805
I THINK THE DIFFICULTY WITH THIS

00:52:55.872 --> 00:52:56.439
BILL IS THE DIVERSITY OF

00:52:56.506 --> 00:52:58.608

DIFFICULTY WITH THIS TO YOUR

TWO MONTHS SO WHEN THEY ARE OUT

TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET

00:53:36.446 --> 00:53:39.983
ENOUGH OF THAT SYSTEM -- TO HELP

THEM AFFILIATE WITH THEM OR WHAT

00:53:41.718 --> 00:53:44.087
NOT AND NOT FROM SUCCESSFUL THEY

00:53:44.154 --> 00:53:45.622
MAY ONLY HAVE TWO MONTHS OF

00:53:45.689 --> 00:53:48.358
PAYROLL LEFT -- WE AND NOT I CAN

00:53:48.425 --> 00:53:49.960
THINK OF FOUR FOUR FIVE

00:53:50.026 --> 00:53:51.261
HOSPITALS SO.

00:53:51.328 --> 00:53:53.196
THUS SECTIONS TO WIN THREE

00:53:53.263 --> 00:53:54.664
RELATED TO CHANGE IN SERVICE

00:53:54.731 --> 00:53:57.000
MAYBE A PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT

00:53:57.067 --> 00:53:58.568
IF YOU NEED TO DOWNSIZE OR

00:53:58.635 --> 00:54:00.704
DOWNGRADE OR TAKE A SERVICE

00:54:00.770 --> 00:54:01.938
OFFLINE SO THAT YOU CAN KEEP

00:54:02.005 --> 00:54:03.707
YOUR E. R. AND MED SURGE AND

00:54:03.773 --> 00:54:06.209
SURGICAL SUITE OPEN. FOR ANOTHER

00:54:06.276 --> 00:54:08.578
TWO MONTHS -- SO I THINK THAT

00:54:08.645 --> 00:54:10.380
THE STRUGGLE AND AND I HEAR THE

00:54:10.447 --> 00:54:12.048
AUTHOR WANTING TO TALK MORE

00:54:12.115 --> 00:54:15.719
ABOUT THAT THE BILL IS THE

00:54:15.785 --> 00:54:16.886
DIVERSE OF IT.

00:54:16.953 --> 00:54:18.989
OUR HOSPITALS HAVE PROBABLY TEN

00:54:19.055 --> 00:54:20.023
DIFFERENT COMMON WAYS IN WHICH

00:54:20.090 --> 00:54:23.026
WE MANAGE OUR SERVICES ENCLOSURE.

00:54:23.093 --> 00:54:24.561
AND I'M PROBABLY BEING THOSE ARE

00:54:24.628 --> 00:54:26.463
BIG BUCKETS I AM I CAN PROP

00:54:26.529 --> 00:54:27.831
THERE'S PROBABLY FIFTY DIFFERENT

00:54:27.897 --> 00:54:29.966
WAYS OUR HOSPITALS MANAGE THEIR

00:54:30.033 --> 00:54:31.901
OPERATIONS AND SERVICES SO.

00:54:31.968 --> 00:54:34.337
A CENTER ALSO [inaudible]

00:54:34.404 --> 00:54:37.574
YES -- I'M HAVING A HARD TIME

00:54:37.641 --> 00:54:39.242
UNDERSTANDING WHY THIS IS BAD

00:54:39.309 --> 00:54:41.077
FOR ANY COMMUNITY.

00:54:41.144 --> 00:54:42.612
ANY PART OF THE STATE I DON'T

00:54:42.679 --> 00:54:52.022
CARE WHERE YOU'RE AT AND I DON'T

00:54:52.088 --> 00:54:53.857
THINK THAT'S GOOD FROM A BIG

00:54:53.923 --> 00:54:55.525
CITY LIKE LOS ANGELES.

00:54:55.592 --> 00:54:57.994
OR A SMALL TOWN LIKE SELMA OR

00:54:58.061 --> 00:55:04.067
FRESNO -- WE'RE TRYING TO DEALWITH WHAT'S THE BEST THING TO DO.

00:55:04.134 --> 00:55:06.770
IN THAT KIND OF A SITUATION.

00:55:06.836 --> 00:55:08.538
AND IF YOU'RE A SMALL PLACE I

00:55:08.605 --> 00:55:10.707
WOULD WANT TO HOLD ON TO THAT

00:55:10.774 --> 00:55:12.342
HOSPITAL AS LONG AS POSSIBLE.

00:55:12.409 --> 00:55:15.245
I WOULD WANT IT THIS. TO CLOSE

00:55:15.311 --> 00:55:17.380
WITHIN THIRTY DAYS OR SIXTY DAYS

00:55:17.447 --> 00:55:18.548
OR NINETY DAYS I WANTED TO STAY

00:55:18.615 --> 00:55:19.916
OPEN.

00:55:19.983 --> 00:55:21.918
AND IT SEEMS TO ME THE PROCESS

00:55:21.985 --> 00:55:23.887
OF ALLOWING A LONGER TIME BEFORE

00:55:23.953 --> 00:55:26.122
IT CLOSES BECAUSE THE LOSS OF

00:55:26.189 --> 00:55:28.725
THAT HOSPITALS SO DEVASTATED.

00:55:28.792 --> 00:55:30.727
ESPECIALLY IN A RURAL AREA

00:55:30.794 --> 00:55:32.495
ESPECIALLY WELL AREN'T SO MANY

00:55:32.562 --> 00:55:33.663
HOSPITALS.

00:55:33.730 --> 00:55:35.665
WHY WOULD WE WANT TO THE LENGTH

00:55:35.732 --> 00:55:37.801
OF TIME TO REALLY JUDGE ANY

00:55:37.867 --> 00:55:39.269
VALUE WAITING GET INPUT?

00:55:39.335 --> 00:55:41.504
AS TO ARE THERE ALTERNATIVES ARE

00:55:41.571 --> 00:55:43.006
THERE YOU KNOW HOW DO YOU DO

00:55:43.073 --> 00:55:44.574
THIS HOW DO YOU DO IT IN SUCH A

00:55:44.641 --> 00:55:46.109
WAY THAT'S THE MOST RESPONSIBLE

00:55:46.176 --> 00:55:50.814
WITH COMMUNITY INPUT SO -- IT IS

00:55:50.880 --> 00:55:52.782
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THIS

00:55:52.849 --> 00:55:54.851
WOULD BE ANY DIFFERENT FROM A

00:55:54.918 --> 00:55:57.654
BIG CITY TO A RURAL AREA IN FACT

00:55:57.721 --> 00:55:59.456
IT'S EVEN MORE IMPORTANT. FOR

00:55:59.522 --> 00:56:02.192
RURAL AREA WHERE THERE'S LESS --

00:56:02.258 --> 00:56:06.129
ACCESS -- TO TO HOSPITALS -- TO

00:56:06.196 --> 00:56:07.731
MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE

00:56:07.797 --> 00:56:10.800
DEEPEST MOST PROFOUND PROCESS.

00:56:10.867 --> 00:56:13.002
AND THE POSSIBILITY EXTEND THE

00:56:13.069 --> 00:56:15.505
POSSIBILITY THAT WE COULD

00:56:15.572 --> 00:56:15.772
ACTUALLY.

00:56:15.839 --> 00:56:16.873
MAYBE.

00:56:16.940 --> 00:56:18.141
NOT CLOSE.

00:56:18.208 --> 00:56:20.176
NOW WOULD BE THE IDEAL IT SEEMS

00:56:20.243 --> 00:56:22.011
TO ME JUST ANNOUNCED THE CLOSURE

00:56:22.078 --> 00:56:24.581
AND GET OUT IS NOT THE IDEAL

00:56:24.647 --> 00:56:26.349
IT'S THE LYNC THAN IT IS TO DO

00:56:26.416 --> 00:56:27.250
THAT SO.

00:56:27.317 --> 00:56:30.386
IF IF YOU HAVE SPECIFIC

00:56:30.453 --> 00:56:33.757
EXPERIENCE IN OUR SENATOR YOU

00:56:33.823 --> 00:56:34.390
JUST EXPLAIN THE REASON FOR THE

00:56:34.457 --> 00:56:35.425
BILL.

00:56:35.492 --> 00:56:37.460
THAT IS THE REASON FOR BILL THIS

00:56:37.527 --> 00:56:38.962
IS THE EXPERIENCE I HAD A LONG

00:56:39.028 --> 00:56:40.830
WHICH IS REAL LIFE EXPERIENCE.

00:56:40.897 --> 00:56:42.198
WE HAD WE HAD A LONGER TIME LINE

00:56:42.265 --> 00:56:43.366
WE COULD HAVE SOUGHT ANOTHER

00:56:43.433 --> 00:56:45.735
OPERATOR KEPT A HOSPITAL OPEN

00:56:45.802 --> 00:56:47.604
HAD WE HAD A LONGER TIME NINE WE

00:56:47.670 --> 00:56:49.405
COULD'VE ADJUSTED ARE MERGING Z.

00:56:49.472 --> 00:56:50.173
SERVICES TO MAKE A MORE

00:56:50.240 --> 00:56:54.477
APPROPRIATE. TO TO TO TO SHORTEN.

00:56:54.544 --> 00:56:55.245
THE WAIT TO GET INTO AN

00:56:55.311 --> 00:56:56.713
EMERGENCY ROOM SO TO ME THIS

00:56:56.780 --> 00:56:58.648
BILL IS A NO BRAINER THIS BILL

00:56:58.715 --> 00:57:00.016
IS ABOUT KEEPING PEOPLE HEALTHY

00:57:00.083 --> 00:57:01.851
SAVING LIVES THIS IS A COMMON

00:57:01.918 --> 00:57:02.886
SENSE APPROACH.

00:57:02.952 --> 00:57:03.753
I UNDERSTAND THERE'S SOME

00:57:03.820 --> 00:57:05.188
TECHNICAL ISSUES WE NEED TO TALK

00:57:05.255 --> 00:57:06.256
ABOUT WE NEED TO WORK ON I'VE

00:57:06.322 --> 00:57:07.524
COMMITTED THAT WE'VE GONE BACK

00:57:07.590 --> 00:57:09.325
TO THOSE A COUPLE TIMES I WELL

00:57:09.392 --> 00:57:10.727
UNDERSTAND THAT AND I'M

00:57:10.794 --> 00:57:11.828
COMMITTED TO HAVE DISCUSSIONS

00:57:11.895 --> 00:57:12.162
ABOUT THAT.

00:57:12.228 --> 00:57:14.130
BUT AGAIN -- THE PURPOSE OF THIS

00:57:14.197 --> 00:57:16.833
BILL TO SAVE LIVES AND AND AND

00:57:16.900 --> 00:57:17.400
THAT'S WHAT IT DOES FROM MY

00:57:17.467 --> 00:57:18.902
PERSPECTIVE.

00:57:18.968 --> 00:57:20.436
SO I KNOW WE ABOUT TO OTHER

00:57:20.503 --> 00:57:21.671
MEMBERS WHO HAVE QUESTIONS TO

00:57:21.738 --> 00:57:22.806
ASK PREVIOUS THIS OF ON THE

00:57:22.872 --> 00:57:24.107
BIGGER INDULGENCE ARE HAVE A

00:57:24.174 --> 00:57:25.575
COUPLE QUESTIONS AND THEN WE'LL

00:57:25.642 --> 00:57:27.777
GET. TO TO YOU THAT RIGHT OKAY

00:57:27.844 --> 00:57:29.846
BECAUSE SO I THE ONE THING I

00:57:29.913 --> 00:57:32.482
WANT -- TO AND I KNOW YOU SAID

00:57:32.549 --> 00:57:34.484
THIS SO I JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY

00:57:34.551 --> 00:57:35.952
SO WHAT WE'RE REALLY TALKING UP.

00:57:36.019 --> 00:57:36.953
BECAUSE I KNOW WE HAD SOME

00:57:37.020 --> 00:57:38.087
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT LIKE LITTLE

00:57:38.154 --> 00:57:39.222
CHANGE THOUGH LANDS WE SHRINK A

00:57:39.289 --> 00:57:40.423
UNIT BY COUPLE BEDS AND I

00:57:40.490 --> 00:57:42.125
UNDERSTAND YOU'VE COMMITTED TO

00:57:42.192 --> 00:57:44.394
WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION AND

00:57:44.460 --> 00:57:45.662
TALK ABOUT THE SCALE BUT I THINK

00:57:45.728 --> 00:57:47.163
WHAT WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT WE

00:57:47.230 --> 00:57:50.700
TALK ABOUT HOSPITAL CLOSURES.

00:57:50.767 --> 00:57:51.768
ARE LET'S SAY A HOSPITAL.

00:57:51.835 --> 00:57:53.002
IN A RURAL COMMUNITY IS THE ONLY

00:57:53.069 --> 00:57:54.504
PLACE WHERE DELIVERY SOUTH AND

00:57:54.571 --> 00:57:55.805
AND THEY DECIDED I SHUT DOWN

00:57:55.872 --> 00:57:58.374
OBGYN.

00:57:58.441 --> 00:58:00.743
AND SO THE QUESTION THERE IS IN

00:58:00.810 --> 00:58:02.712
THERE THE ONLY DELIVERY SITE FOR

00:58:02.779 --> 00:58:04.514
A VERY LONG DISTANCE.

00:58:04.581 --> 00:58:06.249
THE QUESTION IS IS THAT HOW MUCH

00:58:06.316 --> 00:58:08.218
TIME AND I REALIZE THERE'S A

00:58:08.284 --> 00:58:09.686
BALANCE HERE BECAUSE YOU KNOW

00:58:09.752 --> 00:58:10.820
MAYBE THE REASON YOU'RE MAKING

00:58:10.887 --> 00:58:12.188
IS FINANCIAL.

00:58:12.255 --> 00:58:14.224
A BALANCE IN TERMS OF HOW MUCH

00:58:14.290 --> 00:58:15.558
TIME DO YOU GIVE THE COMMUNITY A

00:58:15.625 --> 00:58:17.260
CHANCE.

00:58:17.327 --> 00:58:19.395
TO MOBILIZE THEIR RESOURCES TO

00:58:19.462 --> 00:58:21.064
SAY WHETHER WE CAN SAVE THAT

00:58:21.130 --> 00:58:23.166
UNIT OR FIND AN ALTERNATIVE. TO

00:58:23.233 --> 00:58:24.500
THAT SO WE CAN KEEP THAT SERVICE

00:58:24.567 --> 00:58:25.935
IN OUR COMMUNITY.

00:58:26.002 --> 00:58:27.170
IS THAT WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT

00:58:27.237 --> 00:58:27.470
[inaudible]

00:58:27.537 --> 00:58:29.505
AUTHOR.

00:58:29.572 --> 00:58:31.674
WELL LET ME FIRST LET ME JUST.

00:58:31.741 --> 00:58:33.176
I'M VERY SENSITIVE TO THAT THE

00:58:33.243 --> 00:58:34.344
ROLE THE CRITICAL ACCESS

00:58:34.410 --> 00:58:35.845
HOSPITALS USE WHY DOES BELIEVE

00:58:35.912 --> 00:58:36.746

CALIFORNIA ONE IS ACTUALLY IN MY

00:58:38.381 --> 00:58:39.549
DISTRICT ON CATALINA ISLAND.

00:58:39.616 --> 00:58:40.917
SO I DON'T WANT ANYONE TO THINK

00:58:40.984 --> 00:58:42.318
AT ALL THAT I'M NOT -- WELL

00:58:42.385 --> 00:58:43.453
AWARE.

00:58:43.519 --> 00:58:45.054
OF THE ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH

00:58:45.121 --> 00:58:46.556
SMALL CRITICAL ROLE ACCESS

IS TO GIVE COMMUNITIES TIME TO

00:58:54.130 --> 00:58:55.531
PLAN.

00:58:55.598 --> 00:58:57.800
TIME TO PLAN TIME TO ACT TO

00:58:57.867 --> 00:58:59.702
SERVE THE BEST INTERESTS OF THAT

THAT'S PRETTY TECHNICAL STUFF I

00:59:05.208 --> 00:59:06.209
DON'T KNOW THAT WE CAN WORK IT

00:59:06.276 --> 00:59:06.643

APPRECIATE THAT I THINK WHEN

00:59:12.615 --> 00:59:13.783
THINGS WERE GOING TO LOOK INTO

00:59:13.850 --> 00:59:16.052
IS IS THAT GIVEN THE NATURE OF

00:59:16.119 --> 00:59:16.586
THE BILL IN THE LICENSURE

00:59:16.653 --> 00:59:17.587
EXACTLY.

00:59:17.654 --> 00:59:19.389
SAMPLE SWITCHING ON MRI MACHINE

00:59:19.455 --> 00:59:21.224
I DON'T THINK CAUSES FOR RE

00:59:21.291 --> 00:59:22.692
REVIEW OF THE LICENSE WILL L. WE

00:59:22.759 --> 00:59:23.393
HAVE TO THINK ABOUT WHAT KIND OF

00:59:23.459 --> 00:59:24.427
THINGS WOULD ACTUALLY BE

00:59:24.494 --> 00:59:26.029
TRIGGERED BY THIS BILL WHAT

00:59:26.095 --> 00:59:27.563
LEVEL.

00:59:27.630 --> 00:59:29.232
OF CHANGE I'VE WE WE WHAT WE

00:59:29.299 --> 00:59:31.034

LOOKING INTO THAT SO WE CAN COME

00:59:36.372 --> 00:59:37.874
OUT YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT LOOKING

00:59:37.941 --> 00:59:39.175
AT NIT PICKING.

00:59:39.242 --> 00:59:40.276
YEAH CHANGES IN SERVICE VOTE

00:59:40.343 --> 00:59:41.911
MORE TALKING ABOUT MAJOR CHANGES

SERVICE WHETHER YOU'RE LIMITING

00:59:43.746 --> 00:59:45.081
TIRED DOUBLE OF THE HOSPITAL

00:59:45.148 --> 00:59:46.416
CLOSURE ON ANY TIRE DEPARTMENTS

00:59:46.482 --> 00:59:49.585
OR MAJOR CHANGES TO THOSE.

00:59:49.652 --> 00:59:50.954
THESE TWO MAJOR DEPARTMENTS

00:59:51.020 --> 00:59:52.522
WHERE THERE WOULD BE A

00:59:52.588 --> 00:59:53.756
SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE

00:59:53.823 --> 00:59:55.224
COMMUNITY AND I THINK THAT

00:59:55.291 --> 00:59:56.392
REALLY IS WHAT WE'RE TALKING

00:59:56.459 --> 00:59:58.194
ABOUT I MEAN I KNOW THE SUBJECT

00:59:58.261 --> 00:59:59.629
OF THIS IS HOSPITALS.

00:59:59.696 --> 01:00:00.863
BUT REALLY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:00:00.930 --> 01:00:02.131
IMPACT THE COMMUNITY AND ABILITY

01:00:02.198 --> 01:00:06.903
THE COMMUNITY TO NOW RESPOND TO

01:00:06.970 --> 01:00:08.071
THIS BECAUSE THE HOSPITAL

01:00:08.137 --> 01:00:09.038
OBVIOUSLY IS A VERY IMPORTANT

01:00:09.105 --> 01:00:09.672
PART OF THE COMMUNITY THERE'S A

01:00:09.739 --> 01:00:10.940
SET OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES

01:00:11.007 --> 01:00:12.208
THEY'RE BEING DELIVERED BY THIS

01:00:12.275 --> 01:00:13.242
INSTITUTION.

01:00:13.309 --> 01:00:14.677
AND WHEN THAT INSTITUTION

01:00:14.744 --> 01:00:16.245
DECIDES NO LONGER DELIVER THAT

01:00:16.312 --> 01:00:17.647

FORMER HERE IS THAT THIS IS THE

01:09:21.223 --> 01:09:22.157

BILL BUT I THINK THERE'S SOME

01:09:29.098 --> 01:09:29.965
ISSUES THAT.

01:09:30.032 --> 01:09:30.799
WE CAN WORK OUT HERE IN THE

01:09:30.866 --> 01:09:32.535
COMMITTEE I THINK THE BILL WOULD

01:09:32.601 --> 01:09:34.436
COME OUT STRONGER AND WITH MUCH

01:09:34.503 --> 01:09:36.472
WITH US THAT'S A MORE MORE

01:09:36.539 --> 01:09:38.741
THROUGH THE ESSEX SUPPORT -- AND

01:09:38.807 --> 01:09:40.843
THAT MIGHT BE HELPFUL SO --

01:09:40.910 --> 01:09:44.013
SINCE WE HAVE TIME IT WILL.

01:09:44.079 --> 01:09:45.714
SELL.

01:09:45.781 --> 01:09:47.049
THAT IS THAT IS YOUR DESIRE

01:09:47.116 --> 01:09:47.650
MISTER CERTAINLY AGREE TO IT I

01:09:47.716 --> 01:09:49.351
HAVEN'T AND AGAIN I I THOUGHT

01:09:49.418 --> 01:09:50.286
THIS WAS WORKED OUT SO YEAH I'D

01:09:50.352 --> 01:09:51.654
I THOUGHT SO TOO BUT I THINK

01:09:51.720 --> 01:09:53.088
THAT -- SOUNDS LIKE IN TERMS OF

01:09:53.155 --> 01:09:54.490
WHAT EXACTLY HOW MUCH OF A

01:09:54.557 --> 01:09:56.759
CHANGE NEEDS TO HAPPEN BEFORE WE

01:09:56.825 --> 01:09:58.661
TRIGGERED THE HUNDRED EIGHTY

01:09:58.727 --> 01:10:00.129
DAYS SOUNDS LIKE IT'S STILL UP

01:10:00.195 --> 01:10:03.265
IN THE AIR.

01:10:03.332 --> 01:10:04.600
YES A SENTIMENTAL YES AND I JUST

01:10:04.667 --> 01:10:06.135
WANNA BE CLEAR TO THE OFFER THAT

01:10:06.201 --> 01:10:09.071
THAT MIGHT INQUIRE RE -- AND

01:10:09.138 --> 01:10:11.006
SUGGESTED THAT IT BE HELD -- IS

01:10:11.073 --> 01:10:12.408
WITHOUT PREJUDICE.

01:10:12.474 --> 01:10:15.477
ALL WE HAVE PLENTY OF TIME -- ON

01:10:15.544 --> 01:10:16.145
AND THAT'S THE POINT THAT'S THE

01:10:16.211 --> 01:10:17.513
POINT OF THE POLICY COMMITTEE SO

01:10:17.580 --> 01:10:19.848
I'D I DIDN'T WANT YOU TO ASSUME

01:10:19.915 --> 01:10:23.018
THAT -- I MADE THE SUGGESTION IN

01:10:23.085 --> 01:10:24.553
AN EFFORT TO KILL THE BILL AT

01:10:24.620 --> 01:10:25.955
ALL THAT'S NOT THE CASE AT ALL

01:10:26.021 --> 01:10:27.022
BECAUSE THIS IS THE FIRST

01:10:27.089 --> 01:10:29.191
HEARING I KNEW THAT WE HAD TIME.

01:10:29.258 --> 01:10:30.759
TO DO THE WORK FOR PEOPLE SO

01:10:30.826 --> 01:10:32.428
SOME OF THE UNREST COULD PERHAPS

01:10:32.494 --> 01:10:35.331
BE SOLVED -- OR NOT YEAH AND I

01:10:35.397 --> 01:10:37.900
AND I THINK -- MY DESIRE OF

01:10:37.967 --> 01:10:39.868
WOULD BE.

01:10:39.935 --> 01:10:41.737
TO GET THE BILL OUT -- BUT I

01:10:41.804 --> 01:10:43.305
THINK THAT WE DO A LITTLE MORE

01:10:43.372 --> 01:10:44.740
WORK ON IT BECAUSE I THINK SOME

01:10:44.807 --> 01:10:46.275
ADDITIONAL THINGS CAME UP TODAY

01:10:46.342 --> 01:10:48.010
A FIVE EASIER. FOR FOR THE

01:10:48.077 --> 01:10:49.211
COMMITTEE WITH PLENTY OF TIMES

01:10:49.278 --> 01:10:50.779
THERE'S NO TIMING ISSUE AS

01:10:50.846 --> 01:10:52.081
UNLESS.

01:10:52.147 --> 01:10:53.749
SO I DECIDED TO DAD BEFORE YET

01:10:53.816 --> 01:10:54.850
AND SEE WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS WERE

01:10:54.917 --> 01:10:55.851
GONNA LISTEN I'M WILLING TO GO

01:10:55.918 --> 01:10:56.919
TO WORK AND SEE IF WE CAN COME

01:10:56.986 --> 01:10:57.820
UP WITH A COMPROMISE.

01:10:57.886 --> 01:10:59.755
AND IN SOMETHING THAT WORKS THAT

01:10:59.822 --> 01:11:02.024
REALLY DOES. FOR THE INTENT OF

01:11:02.091 --> 01:11:02.591
THE BILL.

01:11:02.658 --> 01:11:05.027
AS WELL -- AGAIN THAT THIS WAS

01:11:05.094 --> 01:11:07.062
NEW INFORMATION TO ME TODAY THAT

01:11:07.129 --> 01:11:08.464
THERE WERE STILL PROBLEMS I

01:11:08.530 --> 01:11:09.431
THOUGHT WE'D TAKE THE ISLANDS

01:11:09.498 --> 01:11:11.100
AND WE WERE IN A VERY GOOD SPOT.

01:11:11.166 --> 01:11:13.435
AT IOWA AND I STAYED FOR MYSELF

01:11:13.502 --> 01:11:15.137

01:11:19.675 --> 01:11:20.643
LIKE WE NEED TO DO A LOT MORE

01:11:20.709 --> 01:11:22.244
WORK WITH I THOUGHT WE WERE IN

01:11:22.311 --> 01:11:23.245
THE RIGHT PLACE BUT IT'S NOT

01:11:23.312 --> 01:11:24.146
LIKE THERE'S STILL SOME

01:11:24.213 --> 01:11:25.381
OUTSTANDING ISSUES WE STILL HAVE

01:11:25.447 --> 01:11:26.949

BILL OUT THE COMMITTEE -- SO I I

01:11:29.418 --> 01:11:31.053
HOPE BUT I'M JUST SAYING THAT

01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:33.122
HOPING THAT -- MAYBE WE CAN MAKE

01:11:33.188 --> 01:11:35.991
SOME SOME FURTHER ADJUSTMENTS

01:11:36.058 --> 01:11:37.059
THAT WAY AND WE WILL AGENDA IS

01:11:37.126 --> 01:11:39.228

SINCE WE AND SINCE WE'VE HAD TO

01:11:46.802 --> 01:11:48.203
DISCUSS AND I THINK SINCE WE'VE

01:11:48.270 --> 01:11:49.705
HAD THAT DISCUSSION.

01:11:49.772 --> 01:11:51.407
THE DESIRE WOULD BE JUST TO DO

01:11:51.473 --> 01:11:53.642
IT IS A VOTE ON ABOUT ON THE

01:11:53.709 --> 01:11:54.476

01:18:07.883 --> 01:18:09.384
THAT CAN BE WAIVED AND THERE'S

01:18:09.451 --> 01:18:10.952
CERTAIN GUIDELINES UNDER THAT SO

01:18:11.019 --> 01:18:12.587
WITH MEDI CAL OR MEDICAID

01:18:12.654 --> 01:18:14.189
PROGRAM LAST YEAR THERE WERE

01:18:14.256 --> 01:18:15.190
SOME GUARD RAILS THAT WERE PUT

01:18:15.257 --> 01:18:18.427
ON NGUYEN DH CS CAN'T WHAT KIND.

01:18:18.493 --> 01:18:20.662
TYPES OF WAIVERS THEY CAN SEEK --

01:18:20.729 --> 01:18:23.432
THE ACA ITSELF WAS THE STATUE

01:18:23.498 --> 01:18:24.566
THAT SAID THAT WAIVERS WERE

01:18:24.633 --> 01:18:26.735
ALLOWED BUT IT WAS SILENT ON HOW

01:18:26.802 --> 01:18:28.236
A WAIVER WOULD BE SOUGHT.

01:18:28.303 --> 01:18:29.571
PREVIOUSLY CALIFORNIA HAD

01:18:29.638 --> 01:18:31.206
PRESUME TO DO IT THROUGH THE

01:18:31.273 --> 01:18:32.407
LEGISLATURE WE SAW A WAIVER

01:18:32.474 --> 01:18:34.176
PREVIOUSLY THAT WHAT THAT HAD

01:18:34.242 --> 01:18:35.911
LEGISLATIVE AUTHORITY AND IT WAS

01:18:35.977 --> 01:18:36.945
ONLY AND FALL WHEN THE TRUMP

01:18:37.012 --> 01:18:38.647
ADMINISTRATION SAID WERE NOW

INVITING STATES TO DO WAIVERS

01:18:40.816 --> 01:18:42.484
WITHOUT STATUTORY AUTHORITY.

01:18:42.551 --> 01:18:47.756
THAT WE THOUGHT THIS LEGISLATION

01:18:47.823 --> 01:18:48.890
WOULD BE NECESSARY.

01:18:48.957 --> 01:18:50.358
I MEAN THE ONLY CONCERN THAT I

01:18:50.425 --> 01:18:50.959

HEALTH IS AT FOR WAIVER IF THAT

01:19:03.371 --> 01:19:04.840
WEAVER IS NOT EXTENDED BECAUSE

01:19:04.906 --> 01:19:06.708

01:19:26.895 --> 01:19:27.729
GUESS IT GOES BACK TO MY

01:19:27.796 --> 01:19:29.564
QUESTION THAT.

01:19:29.631 --> 01:19:30.732
IS DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND

TO COME BACK TO LEGISLATIVE

01:19:38.406 --> 01:19:39.307
CONTROL AGAIN I DON'T THINK

01:19:39.374 --> 01:19:40.642
ANYBODY'S ANSWERED MY QUESTION.

01:19:40.709 --> 01:19:41.977
ARE THERE OTHER AGENCIES THAT

01:19:42.043 --> 01:19:42.811
HAVE TO COME BACK FOR

01:19:42.878 --> 01:19:44.179
LEGISLATIVE APPROVAL IN ORDER TO

01:19:44.246 --> 01:19:45.380
NEGOTIATE WITH THE FEDERAL

01:19:45.447 --> 01:19:47.015
GOVERNMENT ON ISSUES.

01:19:47.082 --> 01:19:48.617
OR IS THIS THE ONLY ONE AND IF

01:19:48.683 --> 01:19:51.153
THIS IS.

01:19:51.219 --> 01:19:52.487
I DON'T SEE DID I DON'T MEAN IT

01:19:52.554 --> 01:19:53.388
LIKE THAT I'M JUST TRYING TO SEE

01:19:53.455 --> 01:19:54.656
IF IF THIS JUST CREASES MORE

01:19:54.723 --> 01:19:57.459
HAVOC WHERE WE REALLY DO NEED

01:19:57.526 --> 01:19:58.827
THAT WAIVER BECAUSE OUR

01:19:58.894 --> 01:20:00.428
HEALTHCARE SYSTEM IS NOT IN LINE

01:20:00.495 --> 01:20:01.463
LIKE IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE AND

01:20:01.530 --> 01:20:01.863
THEY COULD JUST.

01:20:01.930 --> 01:20:03.131
YOU KNOW NOT YOU SHE WAS A

01:20:03.198 --> 01:20:03.899
WAVERING PENALIZE US AND PUNISH

01:20:03.965 --> 01:20:06.368
AS AN ALL OF THAT SO WE NEED A

01:20:06.434 --> 01:20:07.469
WAIVER.

01:20:07.536 --> 01:20:08.570
IS THIS LIKE A DIG AT THEM AND

01:20:08.637 --> 01:20:10.438
CAUSES ISSUES BECAUSE IT IS KIND

01:20:10.505 --> 01:20:11.806
OF RETALIATORY ON BOTH SIDES.

01:20:11.873 --> 01:20:12.674
AND I DON'T I DON'T THINK THIS

01:20:12.741 --> 01:20:14.342
IS YOU KNOW I DON'T THINK THIS

01:20:14.409 --> 01:20:16.044
IS RETALIX TELL YUR STORY AND I

01:20:16.111 --> 01:20:17.412
DON'T THINK THAT THEY SHOULD BE

01:20:17.479 --> 01:20:18.613
IN ANYTHING CONTROVERSIAL I

01:20:18.680 --> 01:20:20.582
THINK IT'S JUST ESTABLISH AS AS

01:20:20.649 --> 01:20:21.349
I SAID THAT.

01:20:21.416 --> 01:20:23.451
THE FACT THAT WE WENT DECISIONS

01:20:23.518 --> 01:20:25.020
ABOUT YOU KNOW.

01:20:25.086 --> 01:20:25.921
WHERE WAIVERS ARE TIGHTENED HOW

01:20:25.987 --> 01:20:27.589
THAT WANTED TO COME FROM THE

01:20:27.656 --> 01:20:29.558
LEGISLATURE SO IT'S OF A MAJOR

01:20:29.624 --> 01:20:31.493
STAR DRESSERS LISTS ARE AND I

01:20:31.560 --> 01:20:32.928
THINK US THEIR MITCHELL MAY?

01:20:32.994 --> 01:20:34.162
I ALSO HAVE SOME COMMENTS ARE AS

01:20:34.229 --> 01:20:34.963
YOU MAY HAVE A SEPARATE QUESTION

01:20:35.030 --> 01:20:38.066
BUT OFTENTIMES.

01:20:38.133 --> 01:20:40.869
WE WILL -- ASKER REQUEST THE

01:20:40.936 --> 01:20:42.804
ADMINISTRATION TO BE SURE THEIR

01:20:42.871 --> 01:20:45.507
WAIVER PROPOSALS COME BEFORE US --

01:20:45.574 --> 01:20:47.242
NOT JUST WAIVERS BUT OTHER TYPES

01:20:47.309 --> 01:20:49.444
OF DECISIONS WELL SO FRANKLY --

01:20:49.511 --> 01:20:51.179
I SEE THIS IS MORE -- US BEING A

01:20:51.246 --> 01:20:53.014
BILL BE SURE WE EXERCISE

01:20:53.081 --> 01:20:53.415
OVERSIGHT OVER THE

01:20:53.481 --> 01:20:55.817
ADMINISTRATION -- ADD BECAUSE

01:20:55.884 --> 01:20:57.619
WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT THEY DON'T

01:20:57.686 --> 01:20:58.887
COME TO US AND THEN THEY GET THE

01:20:58.954 --> 01:21:00.188
WAIVERS AND SUDDENLY NOW THE

01:21:00.255 --> 01:21:01.856
LEGISLATURE'S FORCED TO DEAL

01:21:01.923 --> 01:21:03.024
WITH OUR CONSTITUENTS SAYING

01:21:03.091 --> 01:21:04.226
WELL PUBLIC ABOUT YOU KNOW WHY

01:21:04.292 --> 01:21:05.360
IS THIS WAIVER.

01:21:05.427 --> 01:21:07.395
NOW DISADVANTAGING OUR DISTRICT

01:21:07.462 --> 01:21:10.332
OR WHATEVER ELSE SO I THINK THAT --

01:21:10.398 --> 01:21:17.472
IN MY MIND THIS IS ABOUT.

01:21:17.539 --> 01:21:18.473
OUR ABILITY TO OVERSEE THE

01:21:18.540 --> 01:21:19.074
NATURE OF THE WAIVER THAT'S

01:21:19.140 --> 01:21:19.708
BEING REQUESTED OF THE FEDERAL

01:21:19.774 --> 01:21:21.543
GOVERNMENT TO BE SURE THAT IT --

01:21:21.610 --> 01:21:23.812
THAT -- THAT WE CAN EXERCISE

01:21:23.878 --> 01:21:25.547
OVERSIGHT OVER OVER THAT -- SO

01:21:25.614 --> 01:21:27.315
THAT'S IN MY MIND IS REALLY WHAT

01:21:27.382 --> 01:21:28.750
THE ISSUE IS AND I AND I

01:21:28.817 --> 01:21:30.118
UNDERSTAND THAT I UNDERSTAND BUT

01:21:30.185 --> 01:21:31.319
I'M TALKING ABOUT THE RECIPROCAL

01:21:31.386 --> 01:21:32.687
WAIVER RIGHT THERE'S WE'RE

01:21:32.754 --> 01:21:34.356
TALKING ABOUT A WAIVER. FOR S.

01:21:34.422 --> 01:21:35.457
TO OBTAIN IN ORDER TO

01:21:35.523 --> 01:21:36.057
COMMUNICATE WITH THE FEDERAL

01:21:36.124 --> 01:21:37.459
GOVERNMENT AYE NEGOTIATION AND

01:21:37.525 --> 01:21:39.294
I'M TALKING ABOUT THE WAIVERS

01:21:39.361 --> 01:21:41.196
THAT WE REQUEST FROM THEM. TO IN

01:21:41.263 --> 01:21:42.397
ORDER TO OPERATE TO DELIVER

01:21:42.464 --> 01:21:44.432
SERVICES TO OUR OUR CONSTITUENTS

01:21:44.499 --> 01:21:45.367
I GUESS MISSION THIS BILL

01:21:45.433 --> 01:21:46.268
DOESN'T DO THAT I REALIZE THAT

01:21:46.334 --> 01:21:47.502
THIS IS ONLY ONE WAY I WRITE

01:21:47.569 --> 01:21:48.169
THAT.

01:21:48.236 --> 01:21:52.540
BUT MY CONCERN IS THAT WE THERE

01:21:52.607 --> 01:21:53.475
ARE TWENTY SIX WAIVERS RIGHT NOW

01:21:53.541 --> 01:21:54.709
AT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS

01:21:54.776 --> 01:21:55.977
ASKING FOR ON BEHALF OF THE

01:21:56.044 --> 01:21:57.212
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.

01:21:57.279 --> 01:22:00.015
AND I GUESS MY MY CONCERN IS IS

01:22:00.081 --> 01:22:01.449
THAT IF WE REQUIRE STATE

01:22:01.516 --> 01:22:03.018
AGENCIES TO ELONGATE THAT

01:22:03.084 --> 01:22:06.254
PROCESS WHICH IS BILLED AS FOR

01:22:06.321 --> 01:22:06.554
ONE AGENCY.

01:22:06.621 --> 01:22:09.090
AND IT WHERE DOES THAT TAKE US

01:22:09.157 --> 01:22:11.993
WHEN WE NEED SOMETHING FROM THEM.

01:22:12.060 --> 01:22:13.361
WELL I THINK WHAT AGAIN WHY AM

01:22:13.428 --> 01:22:14.629
IS IS THIS IS A WAIVER THAT

01:22:14.696 --> 01:22:17.232
CALIFORNIA WILL BE REQUESTING.

01:22:17.299 --> 01:22:19.301
AND ALSO -- ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE

01:22:19.367 --> 01:22:20.435
NATURE OF THIS WAIVER SO IT'S

01:22:20.502 --> 01:22:22.137
NOT EVEN BROADLY FOR EVERYTHING

01:22:22.203 --> 01:22:22.837
THE HEALTH.

01:22:22.904 --> 01:22:24.406
THE H. T. S. DOES ITS FIRST VERY

01:22:24.472 --> 01:22:26.908
SPECIFIC TYPE A WAIVER YES THAT --

01:22:26.975 --> 01:22:29.444
THAT CAN HAVE A BIG IMPACT SO I

01:22:29.511 --> 01:22:30.111
THINK THAT THAT'S WHY WE WANT TO

01:22:30.178 --> 01:22:32.314
KNOW -- AND WE GO THROUGH THIS A

01:22:32.380 --> 01:22:34.249
LOT ALSO IN OTHER PROCESSES TO

01:22:34.316 --> 01:22:35.216
THE GUIDE THE THE ADMINISTRATION

01:22:35.283 --> 01:22:36.351
ALSO WILL WE DON'T NEED

01:22:36.418 --> 01:22:37.686
LEGISLATIVE APPROVAL OVERSIGHT

01:22:37.752 --> 01:22:39.220
WILL AY NO YES WE DID YOU DO

01:22:39.287 --> 01:22:40.822
BECAUSE WE WANT TO KNOW WHAT IT

01:22:40.889 --> 01:22:41.890
IS THAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE DOING.

01:22:41.956 --> 01:22:42.991
RIGHT OTHER THROUGH WAIVER

01:22:43.058 --> 01:22:44.926
THROUGH SOME OTHER ACTION AS

01:22:44.993 --> 01:22:46.928
WELL THAT'S THERE THAT'S A

01:22:46.995 --> 01:22:48.263
CONSTANT ADVOCATE SO I THINK

01:22:48.330 --> 01:22:49.030
THAT YOU KNOW BACK TO TO YOUR

01:22:49.097 --> 01:22:49.831
QUESTION I THINK IT WAS AT THE

01:22:49.898 --> 01:22:50.765
HEART OF YOUR QUESTION I THINK

01:22:50.832 --> 01:22:52.200
IT'S MOE ABOUT GOOD GOVERNANCE

01:22:52.267 --> 01:22:52.867
IS THEN.

01:22:52.934 --> 01:22:54.703
YOU KNOW AND ATTEMPTED TO DO

01:22:54.769 --> 01:22:56.404
SOMETHING THAT'S RETALIATORY.

01:22:56.471 --> 01:22:58.840
INFLAMMATORY IT'S JUST IN WHAT

01:22:58.907 --> 01:22:59.941
WE BELIEVE TO BE GREAT AND I AND

01:23:00.008 --> 01:23:00.575
I DON'T MEAN TO SAY THAT IT'S

01:23:00.642 --> 01:23:02.010
OUR TALENT -- I'M JUST SAYING

01:23:02.077 --> 01:23:03.445
THAT I WANTED TO BE PERCEIVED

01:23:03.511 --> 01:23:05.847
AND I GET AIDS AGAIN IT'S JUST

01:23:05.914 --> 01:23:06.915
WE DON'T REQUIRE IT MY

01:23:06.981 --> 01:23:07.882
UNDERSTANDING IS RESEARCH

01:23:07.949 --> 01:23:09.284
CONSULTANT ADVICE WE DON'T

01:23:09.351 --> 01:23:10.885
REQUIRE THIS FOR ANY OTHER STATE

01:23:10.952 --> 01:23:11.853
AGENCY.

01:23:11.920 --> 01:23:12.754
THEY DON'T HAVE TO COME WITH US

01:23:12.821 --> 01:23:13.455
WHEN THE ADMINISTRATION

01:23:13.521 --> 01:23:15.557
NEGOTIATES ON WAIVERS WITH THE

01:23:15.623 --> 01:23:16.491
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THE

01:23:16.558 --> 01:23:17.892
ADMINISTRATION NEGOTIATES THESE

01:23:17.959 --> 01:23:18.860
WAIVERS.

01:23:18.927 --> 01:23:19.627
AND SO WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO

01:23:19.694 --> 01:23:21.496
FIND ONE OTHER TIME THAT WE

01:23:21.563 --> 01:23:23.298
REQUIRE THE ADMINISTRATION TO

01:23:23.365 --> 01:23:24.632
COME TO LEGISLATIVE APPROVAL TO

01:23:24.699 --> 01:23:26.401
NEGOTIATE A WAIVER.

01:23:26.468 --> 01:23:27.902
FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN

01:23:27.969 --> 01:23:33.641
ARMY VOTER RIGHTS ACT AS MATTER

01:23:33.708 --> 01:23:35.510
THERE'S THERE'S A TON OF THEM.

01:23:35.577 --> 01:23:36.244
HUESO I DON'T TO TIE THE HANDS

01:23:36.311 --> 01:23:36.711
OF THE LEGISLATURE THE

01:23:36.778 --> 01:23:37.579
ADMINISTRATION TO NEGOTIATE WITH

01:23:37.645 --> 01:23:38.480
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IF.

01:23:38.546 --> 01:23:40.081
IT TAKES US AWHILE TO GET OUR

01:23:40.148 --> 01:23:40.849
