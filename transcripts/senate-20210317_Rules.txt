WILL WELCOME DR RIDDLE AND- WE HAD A WONDERFUL CONVERSATION EARLIER IN THE DAY SO I TOLD YOU I DIDN'T REALLY HAVE ANY SPECIFIC QUESTIONS OF INCREDIBLE RESUME THAT I WANTED YOU TO ELABORATE ON AND WE TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THIS BUT- IT IS BASICALLY- HELLO MY LITTLE NOTES HERE. FINE DON'T. WE TALKED ABOUT- YOU KNOW FOLLOWING UP ON THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN RELEASED TO THE COMMUNITY AND WOULD YOU THINK IT HELPFUL IF WE COULD DEVELOP A SYSTEM THAT WE COULD TRACK OF THEIR PROGRESS AS THEY WENT AND THEY WERE RELEASED INTO THE COMMUNITY AND KNOW THAT THE PROGRAMS THAT HAVE BEEN DESIGNED FOR- OF GETTING THEM BACK ON THE RIGHT TRACK WE'RE WORKING AND WHAT ARE WHAT'S YOUR PERSPECTIVE ON THAT BASED ON YOUR- I GUESS DEEP IMMERSION INTO THIS WHOLE ISSUE ON JUVENILE JUSTICE AND CERTAINLY. PROVIDING ON FOR I THINK WE WERE TALKING EARLIER 92% YOU KNOW FIND THEIR WAY BACK INTO POLITE SOCIETY WE MIGHT COLLEGE AT EIGHT PERCENT- KIND OF DO A RETURN TRIP FOR A LITTLE YOU KNOW BOOSTER SHOT I GUESS IN THE END THE PROGRAM SPENT YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT AS WE TALK ABOUT ANY NEW USE HE DID INDICATE THAT THERE WASN'T ANYTHING SPECIFIC IN TERMS OF FINANCE AND DATA AT THE MOMENT BUT HOW WE MIGHT GET SOME OF THAT BECAUSE I THINK WE REALLY WANT TO HOME IN. ON PROGRAMS THAT ARE MAKING A DIFFERENCE FOR THESE KIDS OF WHO WANTS TO SEE A FOURTEEN FIFTEEN YEAR OLD YOU KNOW ON THEIR WAY TO PRISON BECAUSE THEY GET OFF ON THE WRONG TRACK AND- SOMEHOW FIND A WAY ON FRANKLY DON'T FIND THEIR WAY- TO BEING ABLE TO BE PRODUCTIVE AND ENJOY THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT OUR GREAT NATION PROVIDE THE JUST SOME THOUGHTS ON THAT I THINK WE HAD A LITTLE CONVERSATION ABOUT IT AND YOU THOUGHT YOU WOULD THINK ABOUT HIM SOME THOUGHTS. ON IT WOULD PROVIDE SOME THOUGHTS ON IT. I APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOU DID HAVE A CAR. IS THAT THE SHAPE THERE ARE. INSIDE AND IN YOUR SUPPORT OF WHAT WHAT THE- WHAT WORK IS BEING DONE TO HELP THESE YOUNG PEOPLE TO BE SUCCESSFUL. AND SO YOU KNOW A LOT OF WORK AS WE DISCUSSED THOSE INTO HELPING. ARE YOU. COMING TO TERMS FENDER GROW IN THEIR COGNITIVE ABILITIES TO PROCESS AND MAKE. HEALTHY DECISIONS- VERSUS THE FAULTY THINKING THAT THEY COMMITTEE J. J. WITH. AN TO N. IN PARTICULAR TO YOUR QUESTION. IT IS- AT THIS PARTICULAR POINT WHEN THERE'S A HAND OFF IF YOU WILL TO PROBATION TO THEIR COMMUNITIES. THERE'S ALWAYS- A- GREAT EFFORT TO ENSURE THAT THEY HAVE A SUPPORT SYSTEM WRAPAROUND. OF PROGRAMS TO HELP THEM TO RE ACCLIMATE TO THE COMMUNITY WITH THAT BEING SAID. D. J. J. IN PARTICULAR THE COMMISSIONERS WE DON'T HAVE A WE DON'T TRACK THEM. IN SO YOUR OUR CONVERSATION IS WOULD IT BE- BENEFICIAL TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENS AND NOT JUST FROM A CURIOSITY YEAH WHAT HAPPENED TO THE ISSUE- WHO REALLY MADE A SIGNIFICANT. SHIFT IN THEIR LIFE BUT MORE SO FROM HOW CAN WE DO IT BETTER IF WE KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THIS YOUTH. AND THEN ACTUALLY HAVE SOME DATA TO MAKE IT- EVIDENCE BASED AND SO AT THIS PARTICULAR POINT- AND AS I SAID TO YOU EARLIER. I'VE ONLY BEEN DOING THIS- JOB NOW SINCE OCTOBER TWENTY NINETEEN THE GOVERNOR APPOINT ME BUT IT'S GIVING ME SOME CLEAR INSIGHT. AND I FELT THIS WAY BEFORE I. AS AN OFFICER BEFORE I EVEN CAME INTO- YOU KNOW AS A COMMISSIONER WITH THE. J. J. IS. ONCE WE HAVE THIS YOU. AND WE IN A POOR THESE AND INTO THEM AND WE HAVETHEM TREAT THEIR THREE WE OFFEND. THEY NEED TO BE MORE CO PARENTING VERSUS A HAND OUT ONE OF THE BEST PROGRAMS THAT I HAVE BEEN WITNESS TO IS HOW IT'S DONE IN SAN DIEGO AND I USE THAT AS AN EXAMPLE BECAUSE EVEN WHEN THAT THE USER HAS A HALF OF GOOD. REENTRY PLAN WITH THEIR FAMILIES WANTING TO RE ACCEPT THEM OR THEY HAVE A GRANDPARENT OR AUNT OR SOMEONE WHO- A. R. C. WHICH IS YOU KNOW AND TIME SAID THAT THERE'S SOME CORRELATION TO HELP THEM REESTABLISH IN SAN DIEGO THEY ACTUALLY HAVE TO GO INTO THAT TRANSITIONAL. A COMMUNITY WHERE THEY ARE CONNECTED TO RESOURCES AND WE ENSURE THEY ENSURE THAT BEFORE THEY GO OUT INTO THE COMMUNITY BACK TO THEIR HOME THEY HAVE. THEY HAVE THOSE OF THOSE ARM SUPPORT SYSTEMS IN PLACE SO THAT THEY DON'T FALL THROUGH THE CRACKS AND SO I WOULD USE THAT AS AN EXAMPLE BUT AS ALL THINGS AS A COST FACTOR. BUT I AM TO ANSWER YOUR PARTICULAR QUESTION YES I THINK THAT WOULD BE. AWESOME TO HAVE SOME FORM OF. DATA DRIVEN. TRACKING SO THAT WE WOULD KNOW HOW TO HELP THE THEN WHAT WE COULD DO BETTER- AS WE MOVE FORWARD WITH THEM. THANK YOU FOR THAT NOT TO RELENT ABSOLUTELY ON I THINK I HEARD YOU SAY WRAPAROUND AND I KNOW THAT THE COUNTY WAS A LITTLE. A STRETCH WHEN I WAS ON THE BOARD WITH GETTING FUNDS FOR THAT BUT I THINK THAT THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO PUT A LOT MORE AND EMPHASIS IN TERMS OF ARE. YOU KNOW BUDGET FOR ON CHRISTMAS- FOR THE REHABILITATION PROGRAMS THAT ARE OUT THERE AND REALLY AMPLIFY FAT IN TERMS OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT SPENDING SO I WILL CARRY THAT FLORIDIANS. IN MY COUNTY FINAL SAN DIEGO'S REALLY YOU KNOW DONE DONE THE JOB SO FAR AND I KNOW ORANGE COUNTY HAS ALSO THAT. WITH COAL THAT IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT THAT THE RESOURCES ARE THERE FOR THIS PARTICULAR.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH I AM AGAIN I DON'T SAY THIS- YES THE DOOR WORD OUT WHEN I AM HUMBLED- AT THE- LIST OF INDIVIDUALS WHO SUPPORT ME AND KNOWN ME FOR YEARS I'LL START WITH- YOU KNOW CONGRESSMAN- ADAM SCHIFF- WE HAVE OVER TWENTY FIVE YEAR YOU KNOW OUR FRIENDSHIP AND- I APPRECIATE HIM TAKING THE PERSONAL TIME TO WRITE A LETTER ON MY BEHALF. AND THEN I'LL CONGRESS WOMAN FROM HEARING BASS AS WELL AS- JUDY CHU FORMER SENATOR HERO LOU- WHO ALSO WROTE A LETTER ON MY BEHALF AND THEN MY HOMETOWN COMMUNITY- YOU KNOW FORMER MAYOR BILL GO BOGART WHO HAS KNOWN ME OVER THIRTY YEARS AND WORKED WITH ME- THROUGHOUT MY TIME AS A POLICE OFFICER AND A COMMUNITY ADVOCATE. AS WELL AS THE CURRENT MAYOR VICTOR GORDO- WHO HAS- NO ME JUST ABOUT THE SAME AMOUNT OF TIME. AND I ALSO APPRECIATE OTHERS THAT WROTE LETTERS INCLUDING OTHER CHAIR FOR A LOSS AND IS DEMOCRATIC PARTY MARK GONZALEZ AND THE REGIONAL ELEVEN ON DEMOCRATIC PARTY OF MARK- MARC ROMMEL'S AND THERE ARE OTHERS I'M NOT I'M NOT BY ANY MEANS SLIDING THEM BUT FOR SAKE OF TIME I WANT TO THANK. THEM AND I APPRECIATE THE SUPPORT. ALL RIGHT I AM GLAD THAT YOU REFERENCE CONGRESS. ADAM SCHIFF HE IS- FOR MANY WHO KNOW HIM A STAUNCH ALLY TO THE L. G. B. T. L. G. B. T. Q. COMMUNITY- AND I SAY THAT BECAUSE I'M HOPING THAT YOU CAN SORT OF EXPAND ON YOUR- RELATIONSHIP WITH THE BIOLA UNIVERSITY YOU KNOW I WAS GIVEN A COUPLE OF ARTICLES. THAT WERE WRITTEN ABOUT YOU AND THIS APPOINTMENT AND THEY REALLY CONTEXTUALIZE VIEW AS AN ADVERSARY TO THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY AND I WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD. YOU KNOW SPEAK TO THIS. RESHAPE THAT IN YOU KNOW IT'S IF NO ONE ELSE WAS MORE SHOCKED ME. WHEN I READ THOSE STORIES WHICH WERE NOT- IMAGES SAY THIS EASY TO DEHUMANIZE A PERSON WE DON'T KNOW THEM AND YOU DON'T KNOW THEIR STORY AND THEIR ASSUMPTIONS MADE AND SOMETIMES PEOPLE SMEAR OTHER INDIVIDUALS BECAUSE- IT FITS THEIR AGENDA. AND MY FAMILY HAS ALWAYS AND I'LL START WITH MY MOTHER WHO HAS ALWAYS BEEN A STRONG ADVOCATE FOR TREATING PEOPLE FAIRLY AND WITH RESPECT AND DIGNITY AS SHE WAS FORCED FROM HER HOME IN BIRMINGHAM ALABAMA WHEN SHE WAS SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD BECAUSE SHE WAS TOO UPPITY. AND DIDN'T KNOW HER PLACE AND- SHE AN INCORPORATED ENOUGH THAT- YOU DON'T DISCRIMINATE AGAINST PEOPLE. ONE OF THE THINGS. THAT HAVE BEEN- SHOCKING TO ME IS BECAUSE I HAVE A DEEP FAITH. AND I CHOSE I WAS RECRUITED TO TEACH AT BIOLA BY THEN EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR- I'M SORRY JESSE LEE. AND HE ASKED ME IF I WOULD BE WILLING TO TEACH THEIR BECAUSE IT NEVER HAD AN AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMAN THEY NEVER HAD A POLICE OFFICER TEACH THEIR CRIMINAL JUSTICE PROGRAM. AND I SAID YES FOR THE SAME REASON I WENT INTO LAW ENFORCEMENT IN AND PUT MY APPLICATION IN NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE IS BECAUSE I WANTED TO HELP I WANTED TO ENSURE THAT THE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO WANT MONEY TO BECOME POLICE OFFICERS PROBATION AND PAROLE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE TAUGHT BY A YEAR- BLACK LAW ENFORCEMENT MOMENT. WHO HAD SEEN THE STRUGGLES AND WANTED TO ENSURE THAT THEY UNDERSTOOD THEIR ROLE AS US PUBLIC SERVICE PROVIDERS AND NOT JUST ENFORCEMENT AND SO I CHOSE TO TEACH AT THAT SCHOOL TO HELP THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE A LARGER VIEW. OF WHAT IT MEANT TO BE A SERVICE AS A POLICE OFFICER AND- I WAS TAKEN ABACK WHEN I WAS CRITICIZED FOR I WILL NEVER. COMPROMISE ANY PUNCHES IT COMES TO HOW MY- BECAUSE THIS GUY ME IN MY HOUSE AND I CHILDREN SO A LOT OF THE ADVERSARY SITUATIONS. BUT AS I SHARED IN SOME OF MY INTERVIEWS PRIOR TO THIS MEETING IS THAT THE BIBLE HAS BEEN MISUSED FOR GENERATIONS BUT WHAT I WAS TALK FROM FROM GENERAL FROM- GENESIS TO REVELATIONS. IS THAT THE BIBLE HAS THREE HUNDRED PLUS WORDS OF LOVE IN IT AND NOT TO JUDGE OTHER PEOPLE AND YET IT CONSISTENT BAY CONTINUOUSLY IF MISUSED AND I'M NOT GOING TO ALLOW ANYONE TO- TAKE THAT AWAY FROM ME. BECAUSE I BELIEVE IN TREATING PEOPLE WITH RESPECT AND DIGNITY AND MY LIFE HAS BEEN AN EXAMPLE OF THAT. THANK YOU I HAVE ONE FINAL QUESTION AND- USER TALKED A LOT ABOUT JUDGMENT- AND FAIR TREATMENT- AND I THINK THOSE ARE REALLY IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF THIS PARTICULAR COMMISSION AND THE WORK THAT YOU ARE DOING AS A COMMISSIONER YOU KNOW YOU AND I TALKED A BIT ABOUT YOUR HISTORY- ABOUT HOW YOU JOINED THE FORCE- IN PASADENA. ABOUT HOW IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT- ABOUT HOW YOU WERE AN AFFIRMATIVE ACTION HIRE AND WE'RE SORT OF TREATED WITH DISDAIN AND THERE WAS AN EXPECTATION THAT YOU REALLY WEREN'T QUALIFIED BUT YOU WERE THERE BECAUSE THERE WAS A QUOTA THAT NEEDED TO BE MAD ABOUT HIRING A BLACK PERSON. AND SO- AT ALSO GOT ME THINKING ABOUT THE JUVENILES WHO ARE IN THE SYSTEM WHO ARE ALSO DISREGARDED AND DISRESPECTED AND TREATED WITH DISDAIN. AND THE EXPECTATION IS THAT THEIR FAILURES AND THAT THEY'RE NOT GOING TO DO IS TO SUCCEED AND THAT MAYBE WE SHOULD BE INVESTING RESTORATIVE EFFORTS AND FUNDING INTO THEM BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT WORTHY AND I WAS REALLY STRUCK DURING OUR CONVERSATION ABOUT THE SIMILARITIES- HOW INTRIGUING THEY ARE- BETWEEN YOUR STORY AND THAT THE TREATMENT OF THESE YOUNG FOLKS AND PROBABLY THAT PERSPECTIVE IS SOMETHING THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT AND WHAT WE NEED TO HAVE- AS COMMISSIONERS- OVER DJ J. SO I WAS JUST WONDERING IF MAYBE. YOU KNOW IF I WAS READING TO WENT TOO MUCH INTO IT OR IF NOT IF YOU COULD SORT OF SPEAK TO THIS. I APPRECIATE THAT- THAT I BROUGHT MY MOTHER INTO A FOR A REASON BECAUSE AFTER MY PARENTS DIVORCED MY MOTHER RAISED TO THREE THREE DAUGHTERS ON HER OWN PRIMARILY. AND ALSO WORKED TWO JOBS AND I SHARE WITH YOU. SHE SHE WAS ABLE TO GET HER BLUFF AND EARLY WHEN SHE SAID THE ONLY BE A POLICY MEANT THAT- SHE WAS AT WORK. AND IN I KNOW WHAT IT IS TO COME UP YOU KNOW- BASICALLY HAVING. A SITUATION WHERE YOUR MOTHER CAN ALWAYS PROVIDE THE THINGS THAT YOU FEEL YOU NEED OR TO BE ON THE IN CROWD WITH KIDS WHO HAVE MORE. AND I KNOW WHAT IT IS TO HAVE A FREE LUNCH- ALL THE WAY THROUGH MIDDLE SCHOOL AND HIGH SCHOOL- INTO- I WAS ABLE TO GO TO WORK AT FOURTEEN AND A HALF. AT THE CEDAR PROGRAM MAKING TEN DOLLARS NO EXCUSE ME TWO DOLLARS AND TEN CENTS AN HOUR- THAT'S MY JOURNEY MY BEGINNING OF MY CAREER- BUT- I KNOW IT IS TO BE TOLD BY COUNCILLOR. THAT YOU WILL GO TO COLLEGE BECAUSE YOUR FAMILY CAN'T AFFORD IT IN YOU DON'T NEED TO GO YOU DON'T NEED TO TAKE ALGEBRA TWO. BECAUSE WHAT I'M GOING TO COLLEGE ANYWAY TAKE HOME AT. IN THE KNOW WHAT IT IS TO GROW UP IN A SITUATION WHERE YOU KNOW PEOPLE ALWAYS WANT TO THINK LESS OF YOU BECAUSE OF HOW YOU LOOK OR WHAT THE BACKGROUND YOU COME FROM. THEY DON'T TAKING CONSIDERATION WHAT'S BEEN WARNING TO YOU THAT YOU CAN ACHIEVE ANYTHING AND YOU'RE JUST AS GOOD AS ANYONE ELSE AND THAT YOUR LIFE. WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE IF YOU STAY THE COURSE AND SO I'M I USED THOSE. PERSONAL STRUGGLE SO PERSONNEL. THAT MY MOTHER SOLD. GAVE TO US. IN KNOW SOME OF THE JUMP. ARE GOING THROUGH. THEY'RE NOT HAVE A FATHER IN THE HOME AND THE FILL LIGHT WHY CAN YOU HAVE A DIFFERENT FAMILY AND NOT BE WITH OUR FAMILY. AND WHAT THAT CAN DO TO YOU IF YOU DON'T HAVE A STRONG. YOU KNOW. PARENTS WHO CAN WALK YOU THROUGH IT AND YOU STILL. HAVE SOME DOUBTS ABOUT YOURSELF. AND SO CONSEQUENTLY. YOU KNOW I MERRY EARLY- AT NINETEEN. IN PART OF THAT WAS BECAUSE I FELT SAFE. AB I FELT LIKE I COULD BE I COULD BE SAFE WITH HIM. AND WE HAVE. RAISED A FAMILY AND WE HAVE THREE WONDERFUL SONS WHO BRING US ALL KIND OF JOY BUT IT HAS BEEN A ROAD THAT HASN'T BEEN EASY AND I'LL JUST SHARE THIS LAST PIECE INSTANCE DOCTOR TO BACK TO YOU. IS WHEN I WENT INTO THE POLICE DEPARTMENT I HAVE THE AUDACITY TO BELIEVE. THAT BECAUSE I WENT THROUGH THE ACADEMY AND WORE THAT BLUE UNIFORMS AND A HARD FOR SERVICE AND I WILL BE ACCEPTED. AND IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR IT JUST WASN'T THE CASE. AND IT WAS TOUGH. BUT AS MY MOM SAID WHAT DOESN'T KILL YOU WILL MAKE YOU STRONGER AND I'M STRONGER FOR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU SENATOR I'M GONNA TURN TO SENATOR GROWTH NOW. THANK YOU M. MR FOR BEING HERE TODAY WE REALLY DO APPRECIATE IT.

I JUST I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT- AND I'LL KEEP MY COMMENTS SHORT I DON'T HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FOR YOU I READ YOUR BIO- I'VE READ A LOT OF INFORMATION ABOUT YOU. AND I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT AND I REALLY FEEL LIKE IT BUT YOUR LIFE TESTIMONY THE TRAINING THAT YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH. THE JOBS THAT YOU HAVE HELD AT THE DEGREES THAT YOU HAVE GOTTEN. WILL PUT YOU IN A PERFECT POSITION FOR THIS LEGACY POSITION WHERE YOU CAN INVEST IN THE NEXT GENERATION TO MAKE SURE THAT- THEY HAVE EVERY AFFORDED OPPORTUNITY POSSIBLE TO BE PRODUCTIVE MEMBERS OF SOCIETY. AND I DO- AND THAT THAT CAN LIVE OUT LIFE THAT THEY'RE YOU KNOW CALL TO DO. I DO WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON SENATOR BATES IS COMMENTS ABOUT THAT THE TRACKING OR THAT THE DATA INFORMATION. I THINK THAT'S REALLY GOOD IN A COUPLE OF WAYS- ONE WE CAN CELEBRATE THE SUCCESSES IN PROVIDING COURAGE MEANT TO OTHERS GOING THROUGH. A YOUTH AUTHORITY OR YOU'VE PROGRAMS INTO IF YOU FIND- A YOUNG PERSON THAT SEEMS TO DEVIATE BACK AWAY FROM THE PAST THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO ENCOURAGE THEM TO GET BACK ON THAT.

THE VERY BEST THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU SENATOR. SENATOR LAYERED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH A MAN PROTON N. BOB WELCOME TO THE COMMITTEE- I ENJOYED OUR CONVERSATION- I KNOWTHERE WERE TIMES THAT WERE DIFFICULT BOB HOPE BUT IT WAS REALLY HELPFUL. IN THE IS CENTER CALM WALKER WENT DOWN A COUPLE OF THE ROADS THAT- THAT I WANTED TO GO DOWN BUT LET ME MAY BE AT A POINT TO A COUPLE OF THOSE AND ONE IS IT WAS VERY INTERESTING TO ME THAT WHEN WE TALKED. ABOUT WHAT IT WAS LIKE TO GO ON THE POLICE FORCE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR YOU ALSO TALKED ABOUT. BEING PROMOTED. AND HAVING PEOPLE TELL YOU THAT. THEY DIDN'T HAVE THEY DIDN'T THINK THEY HAD TO PAY ATTENTION TO YOU. COULD YOU TALK ABOUT THAT FOR A SECOND. YES WHEN I SHARE WITH YOU IS WHEN I WAS PROMOTED TO SERGEANT- A COUPLE OF THE MALE OFFICERS FELT THAT THEY DID NOT HAVE TO FOLLOW DIRECTION- IN STARKVILLE SERGEANTS IN PARTICULAR JUST TO PUT SOME CONTEXT TO IT. ARE IN CHARGE OF LIEUTENANTS RUN THE DAY TO DAY THEY RUN YOU KNOW THE BUDGET AND SO FORTH BUT THE SERGEANTS REALLY OVERSEE THE OFFICERS THEY ARE CRITICAL COMPONENTS. OF HOLDING OFFICERS ACCOUNTABLE DEALING WITH COMPLAINTS AND ENSURING THAT THE WORK GETS DONE SO TO HAVE THESE- OFFICERS ALLEN'S MY ALREADY AND- WHEN THEY WANTED TO HAVE AN ARREST APPROVAL REPORT. THEY BASICALLY PUSHED BACK ON ME- I HAD TO MAKE A REAL DECISION THERE IN IT WAS IN MY TRYING TO BE LIGHT OR MIKE GOING TO BE RESPECTED AND I CHOSE TO GO WITH RESPECT. AND SO- ARM SIGNS ALSO HAVE THE ABILITY TO. FILE A COMPLAINT AND TO STAFF AND I AGAINST OFFICER FRAN SUPPORT NATION IT ONLY TOOK WALKS. AND I'VE I'VE ENDED UP BEING LIKE BECAUSE I'M FAIR BUT I WAS DEFINITELY GOING FOR RESPECT AND I DID EARN. THANK YOU. ARE BECAUSE I THINK SOMETIMES GIVEN THE NEXT THING I'M GOING TO ASK ABOUT IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE. WHAT WAS GOING ON IN A TIME AND A PLACE THAT THAT MIGHT BE DIFFERENT. WE ALSO TALKED OF. ABOUT THE SITUATION THAT YOU HAD WITH. ARE YOUR PATROL PARTNER WHEN YOU WERE- OUR FIRST ON THE FORCE. AND THE FACT THAT HE IS IN ESSENCE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH HIV AND- ARE. YOU WERE ACTUALLY GIVEN THE OPTION TO TRANSFER AWAY FROM HIM BECAUSE OF THAT GROUP WHICH- I. WAS TOUCHING COULD YOU TALK ABOUT THAT A LITTLE LIKE WHAT THAT CIRCUMSTANCE WAS WHAT THE SITUATION WAS AND SOME OF THE DECISIONS YOU HAVE TO WORK THROUGH AND THAT. YES IT IS- IT WAS A TOUGH TIME AND I ALWAYS SAY THAT PEOPLE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND PEOPLE ARE AFRAID- HIV AND AIDS IT WAS- SOMETHING THAT SWOOPED DOWN ON A NUMBER OF. PEOPLE IN COMMUNITIES AND FAMILIES. AND SO CONSEQUENTLY WHAT ENDED UP HAPPENING WAS THAT- MY COULD POLICE PARTNER SHARE WITH ME BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN TAKING SOME TIME ALL. IF WE DON'T TAKE A LOT OF TIME OFF HERE. AND ROUGHLY AND ROUGHLY WHEN WAS THIS WHAT WHAT ARE WE TALKING NINETEEN NINETEEN NINETY ONE AFTER THANK YOU NINETEEN NINETY ONE AND HE SHARED WITH ME THAT HE HAD- BEEN DIAGNOSED HIV. ARM AND THAT HE WAS HAVING SOME DIFFICULTIES BUT HE WAS GOING TO THE DOCTOR TAKING MEDICATION BUT HAD TO BE ON A REAL REGIMENTED DIET SO WE WERE ACTUALLY AT TRANSFERRED FROM CONTROL AND HAVE BEEN WITHIN THE TWO MONTHS OF ONE ANOTHER. BEEN PUT IN- WHAT'S CALLED OUT I A BACKGROUND INVESTIGATIONS INTERNAL AFFAIRS SO WE WERE WORKING ON BACKGROUNDS FOR DISPATCHERS AND OFFICERS AND SELF SUPPORT SO WE WERE IN A OFFICE ENVIRONMENT BUT WHEN SEVERAL WEEKS STOP INTO THAT WITH MY HE SHARED WITH THE SERGEANT- THE SERGEANTS SHARE. PULLED ME INTO THE OFFICE AND BASICALLY- SAID THAT I DIDN'T HAVE TO WORK WITH HIM BECAUSE HE DIDN'T WANT TO PUT THE APPARATUS AND THAT- YOU KNOW I HAD A CHOICE. IN YOU KNOW. I WILL. I WAS TAKEN ABACK. BECAUSE I JUST DID UNDERSTAND HOW I WOULD HAVE BEEN SOME. WHO IS NOT ONLY MY FRIENDS AND COLLEAGUE BUT WITHIN A- TOUGH TIME OF HIS LIFE. AND SO EDDIE AND I TALK ABOUT IT YES MY HUSBAND HERE. BUT I HAD ALREADY REALLY MADE UP MY MIND- THAT THERE WAS NO THERE WAS NOTHING THAT WOULD HAVE ME TO ABANDON YEAH. IN OUT OF IGNORANCE. SOME PEOPLE SEND US ON THE PEOPLE WE WERE GOING TO HAVE LUNCH WITH YOU HAVE LUNCH WITH ANYMORE SOME OF THE PEOPLE THAT WE WOULD HANG OUT WITH FOR BEER AFTER WORK WE DIDN'T DO THAT ANYMORE. NOT. WE JUST DIDN'T GET INVITED. AND THAT WAS A TOUGH TIME I I WILL TELL YOU THAT WHEN I MET HIS PARTNER- WILL BRING LUNCH SOMETIMES AND I SING CAN BE SO MUCH TO. BUT WHEN I MET AS IT REALLY GAVE ME A CLEAR INSIGHT TO LOVE. THAT WAS GENUINE CARE AND WHEN. DAVID ULTIMATELY WITHIN THE HOSPITAL FOR AGE AND HE WAS EXTREMELY L. ARM. I MET HIS FAMILY WHO HAD NOT INITIALLY ACCEPTED THEIR RELATIONSHIP AND THEY ARE ALL CAME TO UNDERSTAND JUST WHAT I DID IS THAT. COMMITMENT AND LOVE DOES NOT HAVE ANY BOUNDARIES ON. SAME SEX OR OR OR YOU KNOW HAVE SEX IT'S ABOUT LEADING SOME AND IT WAS SOME LIFE CHANGING AND I'LL NEVER WASTE- AND I SHARE WITH YOU I I'VE ALWAYS HAD PEOPLE OF VARIOUS BACKGROUNDS AROUND ME BUT THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I EVERSAW RELATIONSHIP A RELATIONSHIP. AND- I AM GRATEFUL FOR THAT THEY ALLOWED ME TO ARM SHARE IN THAT VERY VERY TOUGH TIME BECAUSE IT WAS. IT NO ONE SHOULD HAVE TO GO THROUGH THAT- I SAW STRAPPING STRONG. 101% POLICE OFFICER GO DOWN TO SKIN AND BONES. IT WAS THAT. THANK YOU FOR FROM. TALKING ABOUT THAT- AND I THINK IT IT GETS TO ANOTHER THING THAT SENATOR COM ORDER WAS TALKING TO YOU ABOUT SIR YOU YOU FAST FORWARD AND YOU GO TO BIOLA UNIVERSITY THE T. H. A. AND YOU SAID WHY YOUR GOING WHAT WAS IMPORTANT TO DO. BUT THEN THEY WANTED TO MAKE YOU SIGN SOMETHING OR MULTIPLE THINGS TO GO IN. THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN IN CONFLICT WITH WHAT YOU JUST SAID. HOW DO YOU HANDLE LEFT. YOU KNOW THEY SAID BEFORE I WAS RECRUITED- AND IT'S NICE TO BE NEEDED NEXT TO BE SOUGHT OUT- AND SO THERE IS AND I SHARE WITH YOU BEFORE AN OVERALL CONTRACT OF YOU KNOW THESE ARE POLICIES I SIGNED A CONTRACT WHEN I WENT TO UNIVERSITY OF PHOENIX I WENT TO THE POLICE DEPARTMENT. BUT WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN HAVE BECOME MORE SOMEONE'S MADE AN ISSUE- IS THE CONTRACT WHICH HAS OVER THIRTY VARIOUS QUESTIONS ABOUT WHO YOU ARE JUST LIKE WHEN I WHEN I FILLED OUT FOR YOU ALL THESE VARIOUS QUESTIONS. AND THREE OF THEM OF THE THIRTY PLUS YOU KNOW I PUT WERE REGARDING ABORTION AND AME SEX AND I THINK IT WAS THERE WITH YOU ONE ABOUT- US DIMSDALE IN YOU KNOW- I'M SORRY RESEARCH. RESEARCH YES THANK YOU. AND YOU KNOW IN THE I SAID EXACTLY IN THE THREE I SAID EXACTLY WHAT I SAID TO SENATOR- HOWEVER IS THAT. MY TEACHING IS THAT THE BIBLE IS ABOUT LOVE IT'S ABOUT NOT JUDGING AND IT'S ABOUT TAKING PEOPLE AS THEY COME AND LET GOD DO THE REST OF THE WORK THAT I WAS THERE NOT TO TEACH THEOLOGY I WAS THERE TO TEACH CRIMINAL JUSTICE AND I WOULD NOT. EVEN CONSIDER TRYING TO TEACH THEOLOGY AND WHEN I GAVE IT BACK TO THE DEAN AND SHE LOOKED AT IT SHE SAYS THAT'S WHY YOU'RE HERE TEACH CRIMINAL JUSTICE. SO YOU I'M ABOUT YOU DIDN'T ANSWER THE QUESTIONS THAT WERE ON THOSE SUBJECTS YOU JUST MENTION. I WAS NOT I WAS NOT REQUIRED TO. THANK YOU AND THEN THERE'S- THERE'S ONE OTHER ISSUE THAT HAS BEEN RAISED R. IN THE COURSE OF THIS AND INVOLVES. BOB POLICE SHOOTING OF A YOUNG UNARMED- AFRICAN AMERICAN MAN WHILE YOU WERE. THE PUBLIC INFORMATION OFFICER OF THE POLICE DEPARTMENT AND I WONDERED IF YOU WOULD DESCRIBE BRIEFLY WHAT THE SITUATION IS. AND WHETHER YOU MADE ANY COMMENTS THAT WERE PERSONAL THE COMMENTS YOU MADE A DURING THE COURSE OF THAT SITUATION.

BY FRANKLY I'M NOT PART OF THE INVESTIGATION TEAM. AND SO WHEN I READ THAT I HAD MADE OR HAD DONE SOME INVESTIGATION AND HAD MADE SOME SOME STATEMENTS UNLIKE THIS PERSON DIDN'T. BOTHER TO ASK ME OR TO BOTHER TO. FIND OUT WHAT THE PROCESS IS WHEN YOU HAVE A ON P. I. O. AND SO- IT COULD BE FURTHER FROM THE TRUTH BUT I HAVE IS NOT THE FIRST TIME.

SENATOR THANK YOU HI DOCTORAL I WANNA COME IN ON TWO THINGS ONE- AN UNRELATED ITEM BUT ONE THAT I'M PARTICULARLY- IMPORTANT TO ME SB SIX TWENTY FIVE WHICH JUST HAPPENED TO BE MY BILL. ESTABLISHED I KNOW SHOCKING AND THEN- THIS IS REESTABLISHED WHAT'S CALLED AN HONORABLE DISCHARGE PROGRAM FOR JUVENILE OFFENDERS. THAT SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED SUPERVISION AFTER BEING UNDER STATE CUSTODY AND THE ABILITY TO EARN AN HONORABLE DISCHARGE RECOGNIZES. THE PROGRESS THAT A YOUNG PERSON IS MADE AFTER LEAVING DJJ AND REMOVES BARRIERS TO CERTAIN OCCUPATIONAL LICENSES DUE TO THEIR CRIMINAL BACKGROUND. A YOUTH WHO WAS UNABLE TO EARN AN HONORABLE DISCHARGE MAY FACE BARRIERS TO OBTAINING A LICENSE TO BECOME MAYBE A BARBER OR COSMETOLOGIST THE CONTRACTOR CORRECTIONS OFFICER ECCENTRIC. IN A WARD OF AN HONORABLE DISCHARGE WILL DEMONSTRATE REHABILITATION TO FUTURE EMPLOYERS UNFORTUNATELY OR WE'RE SEEING THAT DJJ REPORTS THAT THEY RECEIVED RELATIVELY FULL FEW COMPLETE APPLICATIONS FOR HONORABLE DISCHARGE- AND THEY REVIEWED FOR APPLICATIONS LAST YEAR AND ALL FOUR WERE GRANTED. HAVE YOU DO YOU HAVE YOU YOURSELF HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO CONDUCT AN HONORABLE DISCHARGE HEARING AND WHY DO YOU THINK THE DJJ DOESN'T RECEIVE MORE APPLICATIONS IS. THE PROGRAM SOMETHING YOU DISCUSS WITH YOUTH ARE ENCOURAGED TO PURSUE ANY THOUGHTS ON. HOW TO HAVE YOUNG PEOPLE TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT PROGRAM. SO THERE'S A LOT IN THERE BUT YES I HAVE SORRY OKAY THAT'S OKAY YES AND YES AND YES EVERY IN EVERY DISCHARGED CONSIDERATION I'LL GO BACK TO THEIR- ANNUAL REVIEWS THEY ARE TOLD ABOUT THE HONORABLE DISCHARGE AND HOW TO GO ABOUT IT. AND THEY ARE GIVEN- FORM WHICH NOW YOU CAN DOWNLOAD ON YOUR COMPUTER OF THE THAT- WITH A Q. R. CODES BUT HOW TO GO ABOUT GETTING AN HONORABLE DISCHARGE AND THE IMPORTANCE OF IT TO THEIR FUTURE LIFE AND SO THEY GET THAT NOT ONLY DURING THE ANNUAL BUT AT THE DESTRUCTION INSPIRATION HEARINGS AND IS DOCUMENTED ON THEIR ON OUR BOARD ORDERS. AND THE- PROBATION OFFICERS THREES ALWAYS ENSURE THAT THEY ARE ARE FOLLOWED UP ON AND HAVE THE ACCURATE INFORMATION I HAVE PERSONALLY DONE A NUMBER OF HONORABLE DISCHARGES SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE AND I'LL TELL YOU IT'S A WONDERFUL FEELING TO BE ABLE TO SAY YES. OUR MOTION IS TO APPROVE AND TO CONCUR AND ALLOW THAT YOUNG PERSON TO HAVE IT YOU JUST HAVE TO GO ALL IS LIKE IF. HELLO AND WE DON'T GET TO THE COURTHOUSE YOU KNOW MAKE SURE THAT YOU TAKE THE FORM WITH YOU AND LET THE JUDGE KNOW THAT YOU HAVE BEEN APPROVED AT FOR THE LAST EIGHTEEN MONTHS. OR SINCE YOU'VE BEEN RELEASED AND A LOT OF TIMES IT'S LONGER THAN THAT THAT YOU HAVE SUCCESSFULLY REINTEGRATED INTO THE COMMUNITY AND I. OUR LAST NIGHT MYSELF ON AGAIN I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOUR BILL BUT KUDOS TO YOU. OKAY YOU I THOUGHT ALL ABOUT THE PRODUCT IS WHAT THIS WONDERFUL IS ONE AFTER. I KNOW PEOPLE PERSONALLY AND JUST COMPLETELY. IN MY OWN FAMILY THAT HAVE USE THAT ARE THAT HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THAT. NOW THE Y. MORE PEOPLE DOING IT I HAVE ALL THE YOU'RE- I THAT BUT I WILL TELL YOU THAT THEY KNOW. I SOMETIMES LIFE. ALL WEEK WEEK THAT THAT STAFF. CONTINUOUSLY ASK THEM IT IS NOT DIFFICULT YOU KNOW JUST GET A- A PROBATION REPORT I ENSURE THAT THE RIGHT IS A LITTLE BIO ON WHAT YOU'RE DOING NOW IF YOU WANT TO HAVE SOMEONE COME AND SPEAK FOR YOU IN SUPPORT. LIKE A R. C. OR SOME OTHER MENTOR SHIP PROGRAM THAT YOU'RE INVOLVED IN AND THEN WE JUST HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH. THANK YOU AND I SHOULD BE A STRAIGHTFORWARD HERE AND SAY THAT I RE ESTABLISH THE PROGRAM SOMEONE ELSE ACTUALLY DID THE BILL TO GET IT DONE BUT IT IT WENT THE WAY SIDE SO I WANT TO TAKE CREDIT FROM. SOMEONE PREVIOUSLY WHO WHO REALLY DESERVED IT. YOU KNOW I THINK I KNOW THE ANSWER TO THIS BUT- I'M GOING TO ASK BASED ON SOME OF THE COMMENTS YOU MADE ABOUT ACCEPTANCE AND- YOU KNOW THE LESSONS YOU LEARNED FROM YOUR MOTHER I LEARN THE SAME LESSONS FOR MY MOTHER. I GREW UP IN THE SOUTH AS WELL AND- YOU KNOW IT'S A DIFFERENT APPROACH ON LIFE ARE. THE TEMPLE WHERE YOU GROW UP AND MY MOTHER WAS ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE THAT ARE. REALLY LOVED EVERYONE SHE DIDN'T REALLY CARE WHAT THEIR STORY WAS IT WASN'T RELEVANT TO HER SHE WAS A WOMAN OF FAITH ALSO- SO I REALLY APPRECIATED YOUR APPROACH IN YOUR COMMENTS ON THAT- BUT IN OTHER UP APPOINTMENTS WHERE WE'VE TALKED TO- PARTICULARLY MEMBERS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT CDC ARCSEC TRASH. I'VE ASK- AND ALSO- OTHER A PROBATION ADULT PROBATION- ABOUT IT IF YOU COME IN CONTACT WITH A MEMBER OF THE LGBT COMMUNITY SINCE OBVIOUSLY PEOPLE FELT COMPELLED TO BRING THAT UP IS AN ISSUE WHEN WE GOT COMMENTS AND LETTERS- IT YOU DON'T ALWAYS KNOW SO I'M NOT GOING TO ASSUME. THAT PEOPLE DISCLOSE THAT TO YOU YOUNG PEOPLE ARE DISCLOSED THAT TO YOU. BUT IN YOUR EXPERIENCE HAVE YOU COME ACROSS THE US SO MEMBERS OF THE LGBTQ. Q. COMMUNITY THAT YOU'VE BEEN ABLE TO ADVISE AND COUNSEL AND I WOULD ASSUME BASED ON MY VERY SAID THAT YOU TREAT THEM. I EQUITY AND GIVE THE SUPPORT THAT THEY NEED AND- JUST YOU WANT TO COMMENT IF YOU'VE FELT LIKE YOU'VE COME ACROSS SOME. YOUNG FOLKS. WELL THE ANSWER WILL BE ABSOLUTELY- SINCE I'VE BARED MY SOUL HERE TODAY. YES. YOU YOU CERTAINLY HAVE. YEAH YES IN I MIGHT MY MEANT HE WAS NOW MY GOD DAUGHTER- I MET HER WHEN SHE WAS FOURTEEN. AND TOUGH TOUGH STORY TO HELP HER I HAD TO WAIT MIDDLE SCHOOL AND- IT JUST CONTINUED FROM THERE. THE REASON I BRING HER UP IN PARTICULAR IS BECAUSE- WHEN SHE WAS SEVENTEEN SHE HAD- MY GOD SON YOU KNOW LOW CONNOR- AND- IT WASN'T A GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH HER BOYFRIEND WHATEVER HAPPENED IT DIDN'T IT DIDN'T WORK OUT. BUT ABOUT THREE YEARS AGO SHE SHE CAME TO ME AND SHARE THAT- SHE WAS IN A RELATIONSHIP- AND THAT HER FATHER AND FAMILY WERE COMPLETELY AGAINST THEM I WAS KIND OF TAKEN ABACK I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT SHE FRIDAY WOULD BE. ABOUT MY GOD WHAT IS HE LIKE A MAJOR DRUG DEALERS SOMETHING I DON'T KNOW WHAT SHE'S TALKING ABOUT AND THEN SHE SAID NO IT'S A IT'S ANOTHER GIRL. AND SHE WAS IN TEARS I MEAN. IT HEARTFELT TEARS AND IT BROKE MY HEART BECAUSE SHE IS ONE OF THE SWEETEST YOUNG WOMEN. THAT YOU COULD EVER WANT TO MEET AND I LOVE HER AND SHE SAID. ARE YOU GONNA YOU KNOW AMANDA ME BACK IN MY FAMILY ROOM. THANK. YOU ALABAMA ME TO. I DON'T DO THAT BY SEN LEILA. THANK YOU KNOW. I DON'T I DON'T SUBSCRIBE TO THAT AND I WANT TO BE TREATED A CERTAIN WAY AND THEY'RE FINE OBLIGATED TO TREAT OTHERS THAT WAY. THANK YOU DOCTOR REAL YOU KNOW OUR I WOULD JUST SAY MY PARENTS NEVER BANDED ME EITHER I'M PRETTY SURE THEY DIDN'T UNDERSTAND- BUT THEY THEY DIDN'T ABANDON THEIR CHILD AND I AM FOREVER GRATEFUL FOR THAT- IN THE REASON I ASKED THAT QUESTION IS BECAUSE WE HAVE TALKED TO OTHER- WHEN WE WERE WORKING ON SOME OF THE CD ARE- CDC. OF APPOINTMENTS AND DEALING WITH- MEMBERS OF THE TRANS GENDER NON BINARY COMMUNITY WE HAD TO DO SOME EDUCATION- IN THE PRISON SYSTEM AND REQUIRE AND ASK THEM TO DO SOME TRAINING.

I AM GRATEFUL FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD UPON MY EXPERIENCE AND EXPAND MY ABILITY TO SERVE VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA. I APPRECIATE THE TRUST THAT GOVERNOR NEW SOME SECRETARY GALLEY DIRECTOR JOHNSON HAVE BEEN ASKING ME TO SERVE IN THIS CAPACITY. I'D ALSO LIKE TO THANK MY MENTORS BOARD MEMBERS COLLEAGUES AND STAFF ALONG THE WAY. WHAT HELPED ME EVOLVE AS A LEADER. FINALLY I AM BEYOND GRATEFUL FOR MY TEAMS AT EDS ASKED FOR THEIR ONGOING ASSISTANCE TO TEACH ME WHAT I NEED TO KNOW JUST SUPPORT THEIR VITAL WORK. I WOULD LIKE TO THINK MY HUSBAND'S JUNE KENOSHA MY SON TAIYO AND MY FATHER BROUGHT QATARI WHO ARE HERE IN LIVE STREAM TODAY WITH ME. I ALSO LIKE TO TAKE A MOMENT TO REMEMBER MY MOTHER LORNA THE PASSED AWAY LAST APRIL. AFTER LIVING WITH THE HEALTH RELATED DISABILITY FOR MOST OF HER ADULT LIFE. MY EXPERIENCE CARING FOR HER FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS. ABSOLUTELY INFORMED ME AS A SOCIAL WORKER AND AS A LEADER. IT CRYSTALLIZED MY FOCUSED ON EVERY DOOR IS A RIGHT GEORGE LOS IFFY. ON LEVERAGING RESOURCES AND PROGRAMS TO PROMOTE A WHOLE PERSON APPROACH TO CARE. AND BUILDING TEAMS WHO OPERATE WITH EMPATHY AND COMPASSION FOR THOSE THAT WE SERVE. I'VE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORKING COUNTY SYSTEMS AND IN THE NONPROFIT SECTOR ON A MULTITUDE OF SOCIAL SERVICE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND HEALTH RELATED ISSUES BEFORE COMING TO THE STATE LAST JULY. MY INTENT IS TO USE THIS EXPERIENCE TO ASSIST DIRECTOR JOHNSON IN MEETING THE DEPARTMENT'S GOALS OF CONNECTING THE DOTS BETWEEN PROGRAMS TO BUILD OUT THE COMPREHENSIVE SYSTEMS OF CARE FOR ADULTS CHILDREN AND FAMILIES. ALTHOUGH THE VAST MAJORITY OF MY TIME SINCE COMING TO CDSS HAS BEEN FOCUSED ON THE PREVENTION AND MITIGATION OF EFFORTS SURROUNDING THE PANDEMIC I LOOK FORWARD TO WHAT'S NEXT. AS WELL AS THE LEGISLATURE IN THE ADMINISTRATION HAVE ENABLED THE CREATION OF CRITICAL PROGRAMS THAT SERVE CALIFORNIA'S MOST VULNERABLE. THE DSS HAS A WIDE ARRAY ARRAY OF PROGRAMS THAT WE ADMINISTER. WITHIN THAT SCOPE I HAVE FIVE. FIVE DIVISIONS UNDER MY LEADERSHIP EACH WITH A DIFFERENT SET OF GOALS AND GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES. THE COMMUNITY CARE LICENSING DIVISION IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ENSURING THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF CHILDREN AND ADULTS. WERE OVERSIGHT OF CHILD CARE PROGRAMS ADULT AND SENIOR FACILITIES AND CHILDREN'S RESIDENTIAL HOMES FOR FOSTER YOU. OUR DISABILITY DETERMINATION SERVICES DIVISION DETERMINES ELIGIBILITY FOR CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE APPLYING FOR DISABILITY BENEFITS THROUGH THE FEDERAL SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION. OUR DISASTER SERVICES BRANCH IS THE MASTER HEARING SHELTER LEAD FOR THE STATE ENSURING THAT THROUGH LOCAL PARTNERSHIPS COMMUNITIES WHO ARE IN THE FACE OF DISASTER ARE CARED FOR AND FED AND SHELTERED. OUR STATE HEARINGS DIVISION IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ENSURING THAT INDIVIDUALS WHO FEEL THEY HAVE NOT BEEN AFFORDED THE BENEFITS THEY'RE ENTITLED TO THE STATE SAFETY NET PROGRAMS. HAVE A PLACE TO APPEAL THIS DECISION AND LAST BUT CERTAINLY NOT LEAST OUR LEGAL DIVISION ENSURES THAT WE ARE CROSSING OUR TEAS AND DOT IN OUR EYES IN THE PROVISION OF SERVICES AND OUR BUSINESS PRACTICES THROUGHOUT THE DEPARTMENT. DESPITE THE WIDE VARIETY OF FUNCTIONS UNDER MY UMBRELLA I HAVE SOME COMMON GOALS THEY HOPE TO ACHIEVE. THESE INCLUDE INCREASING IN OUR ABILITY TO COLLECT AND MAKE MEANINGFUL USE OF DATA TO INFORM DECISION MAKING AND FUTURE PLANNING. FRANKLIN PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN CDSS DIVISION AND EXTERNALLY WITH STAKEHOLDERS TO BUILD MORE EFFECTIVE SYSTEMS OF CARE FOR THOSE WE SERVE. AND ENSURING THAT OUR SERVICES ARE CREATED AND EVALUATED OR IN EQUITY LANDS PRIORITIZING THOSE WHO NEED US MOST. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY AND I AM HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I DIRECTOR LET ME START WITH OUR- NEW MEMBER OF THE RULES COMMITTEE SENATOR YOU READY GO. KAMLAGER SURE THING MADAM CHAIR WELL- I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR- YOUR SERVICE FIRST OF ALL I WANTED. TO SAY A SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS I KNOW THE LOSS OF A MOTHER- CAN BE DIFFICULT AND I'M SURE IT WAS ESPECIALLY TRYING LAST YEAR SO MY CONDOLENCES TO YOU AND YOUR FAMILY FOR THAT. YOU KNOW I ARE. I'M JUST GONNA SAY FORGIVE ME IN ADVANCE BECAUSE I HAVE A LOT OF QUESTIONS- I WAS LOOKING THROUGH THE BINDER AND OF COURSE THE THING THAT WAS MOST ARRESTING TO ME WERE THE ARTICLES. ON- OUR CHILDREN WHO WERE SENT TO OUT OF STATE FACILITIES RUN BY THIS FOR PROFIT- COMPANY. AND JUST WANTED TO ASK YOU SOME CLARIFYING QUESTIONS ON- SORT OF YOUR ROLE ON THAT EXPERIENCE ON NEXT STEPS- IF YOU DON'T MIND SO I WAS WONDERING WHERE DID YOU OVERSEE ALL OF THAT OR WERE YOU APPOINTED AFTER. THIS HAD HAPPENED. THANK YOU NO I WAS ACTUALLY APPOINTED AFTER THIS IT HAPPENS BUT CERTAINLY ONE OF MY ROLES AND OVERSEEN THE LICENSE ENOUGH FACILITIES IT'S JUST CERTAINLY LOOK AT HOW WE CAN IMPROVE GOING FORWARD AND LESSONS LEARNED AND SO TO THAT EXTENT- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I'VE REALLY BEEN WORKING ON WITH MY TEAM AND COMMUNITY CARE LICENSING AND IS LOOKING AT THE WAY THAT WE- OVERSEE AND MONITOR OUR PROGRAMS TO ENSURE THAT THE LESSONS LEARNED THAT THAT ARISE FROM THAT SO FOR INSTANCE MAKING BETTER USE OF DATA- AND ENSURING THAT WE'RE MONITORING OUR FACILITIES EFFECTIVELY- GOING FORWARD. ABSOLUTELY I PRIORITY. FOR MYSELF AND FOR THE DEPARTMENT. AND SO HOW WOULD YOU THAT ON A GO FOREIGN FORWARD BASIS IN TERMS OF MONITORING I MEAN THIS ISSUE AROUND CERTIFYING FACILITIES AND RECERTIFYING FACILITIES AND- INSPECTING THEM IN. YEAH THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION SO ONE OF THE THINGS JUST TAG GIVE A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND AS WE- IN TERMS OF LICENSING WE LICENSE THE FACILITIES WITHIN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA OUTSIDE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THOSE FACILITIES ARE ACTUALLY LICENSED BY OTHER STATE BUT WE DO CERTIFY THOSE FACILITIES SO IT'S A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT RELATIONSHIP THAT WE HAVE. WITH OUT OF STATE FACILITIES. LAST YEAR I IN THE FACE OF SOME TRAGEDIES THAT HAVE OCCURRED IN OUT OF STATE FACILITIES THE DEPARTMENT MADE A DECISION TO TAKE A LOOK AND DO A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW OF ALL OF OUR OTHER STATE FACILITIES. I'M WE DID THAT THROUGH LOOKING AT A COMBINATION OF COMPLAINT INVESTIGATION FINDINGS SERIOUS INCIDENT REPORT AND WERE YOU LOOKING AT PROGRAMS STATEMENT THAT HAVE BEEN SUBMITTED TO ENSURE THAT FACILITIES OPERATIONS WERE IN LINE WITH WHAT THEY SAID THEY WERE GOING TO DO. DURING THAT REVIEW PROCESS WE DID MAKE A DECISION TO DECERTIFY SIXTEEN OUT OF STATE FACILITIES AND SO TO DATE WE HAVE NO OUT OF STATE FACILITIES. WE BROUGHT A HUNDRED AND THIRTY TWO YEARS BACK IN PARTNERSHIP WITH COUNTIES AND PROVIDERS WITHIN CALIFORNIA TO- TO THE STATE. AND WE DID LEARN. A LOT OF REALLY GOOD. REALLY HALF SEVERAL MONTHS AND PROSPECT ONE OF THE LESSONS IS. DATA AND AROUND HOW WE- AND HOW WE TRACK DATA WHEN IT COMES TO OUR OTHER STATE FACILITIES. AND SO WHAT I WILL SAY IS THAT WE WERE LOOKING AT INCIDENTS THAT COME UP WE WERE LOOKING AT THEM AND- COUNTY PARTNERS FOR. A FLEETING AGENCIES FOR LOOKING AT THE INCIDENT HOWEVER WHAT WE DIDN'T HAVE WITH THE GOOD SYSTEM IN PLACE TO LOOK AT PATTERNS OF INCIDENTS AND SO THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE'RE BUILDING. AND PUTTING IN PLACE. ADDITION ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IS THE CONTINUUM OF CARE WITH. CALIFORNIA AND ENSURING THAT WE HAVE THE PLACEMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR YOU. SO THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TO LEAVE THE STATE SO THAT WE CAN SERVE THEM RIGHT HERE IN CALIFORNIA WHERE WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE MORE AND BETTER OVERSIGHT. AND THEN OBVIOUSLY- THEY ARE MAYBE NOT SO OBVIOUSLY BUT- ONE OF THE THINGS WE ALWAYS HAVE TO BALANCE THAT. IS THE BALANCE BETWEEN PRESERVING PLACEMENT AND ENSURING HEALTH AND SAFETY OF THE YOUTH THAT WE SERVE. AND SO. DURING THE CONTINUUM OF CARE REFORM CHILD WELFARE ONE OF THE THINGS WE STARTED TO LOOK AT A LITTLE BIT CLOSER IN THE STATE. IS NOT JUST WHETHER OR NOT OUR LICENSED FACILITIES WERE MEETING THEIR OBJECTIVES BUT ALSO. NOT ONLY WHAT THEY WERE DOING BUT HOW THEY WERE% DOING THAT WERE THEY ACTUALLY PROVIDING SERVICES THAT WORKS FROM INFORMS IN THE LEAST RESTRICTIVE SPENDING THAT'S OKAY THAT'S AN OVERLAY IN WHICH WE AND LIFE WILL BE AND WILL BE WORKING. OUT MORE CLOSELY WITH OUR PARTNERS. IN THAT KIND OF CHILD AND FAMILY SERVICES DIVISION WHICH IS OVERSEEN BY CHIEF DEPUTY JUDGE RIGHT NOW. TO BE ABLE TO ENSURE THAT WERE OVERLAIN APOLOGY AND TROM INFORMED FRAMEWORK IN THE LIFE OF BEING OUT OF POSITION. SO THOSE ARE JUST A FEW OF THE LESSONS LEARNED THAT I REALLY LOOK FORWARD TO THE OPPORTUNITY TO STRENGTHEN. THAT'S NOT OVERSIGHT AND THAT CONTINUE OF OPTIONS FOR YOU GOING FORWARD THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION SO FOR THE PEOPLE WHO WERE THERE DURING THIS. TIME WHO IN MY- ESPECT OF KENDALL THIS KIND BEHAVIOR THEY SO IN THE- I WILL SAY THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF TRANSITIONS IN THE DEPARTMENT HOWEVER WHAT I WILL SAY IS THAT- WE ARE REALLY LOOKING AT OUR SYSTEMS AND WE'RE LOOKING AT. WHAT WHAT GAPS WE MAY HAVE HAD IN OUR SYSTEM A LONG WAY AND SO ABSOLUTELY TO THE EXTENT. THAT WE NEED TO DO SOME COURSE CORRECTION WE HAVE BEEN WE WILL CONTINUE. CORRECTION I JUST HAVE A OKAY- SO IN MY FORMER WIFE I WORKED AT A NONPROFIT CHILD DEVELOPMENT ORGANIZATION AND ONE OF THE RUNNING JOKES ABOUT CCL WAS THAT BY THE TIME THEY GOT AROUND TO INSPECTING A CHILD CARE CENTER THE CHILDREN WOULD HAVE AGED OUT OF THAT CENTER- IT WAS UNDERFUNDED THEY DID NOT HAVE ENOUGH INSPECTORS AND SO THIS WAS A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO- SO CAN YOU CAN YOU SPEAK TO THAT IN TERMS OF. I'M VERY CURIOUS ABOUT ACTUALLY HOW INSPECTIONS HAPPEN NOW OVER ZOOM I JUST WONDER ABOUT THE ABILITY TO GET REALLY ACCURATE AN ACUTE INFORMATION BUT THEN I'M ALSO WONDERING ABOUT SORT OF THE STAFFING AND BACKLOG- AND YOUR ABILITY TO MAKE INSPECTIONS- IN A TIMELY FASHION. IF THAT'S CHANGED YEAH NO ABSOLUTELY- OUR TEAM ABSOLUTELY HAS REQUESTED MORE RESOURCES OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS AND WE HAVE STEPPED UP AND INCREASED OUR ABILITY TO BE RESPONSIVE TO OUR FACILITIES BOTH IN TERMS OF OUR INSPECTION PROCESS WHICH WE HAVE IMPROVED ON- WE'VE TAKEN A LOOK THROUGH A PARTNERSHIP WITH THE UNIVERSITY YES YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO LOOK AT OUR INSPECTION TOOL AND MAKE SURE THAT IT'S MORE ROBUST AND WE'RE LOOKING AT THE FACILITIES IN A DIFFERENT WAY AND DID PREVIOUSLY ALSO I WILL SAY DURING THE PANDEMIC. I KNOW THAT- THERE WAS SOME ASSUMPTIONS THAT WE WEREN'T GOING OUT TO FACILITY AND CERTAINLY WHERE AS WE DID AND SOME OF OUR ACTIVITIES THAT WERE IN PERSPECTIVE FOR THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF THOSE RESIDENTS AT THE FACILITIES THAT'S WELL ASK. WERE ON STAFF THANK YOU WE WERE STILL RESPONDING IN PERSON TO TYPE ONE AND TYPE TWO- INVESTIGATIONS WHICH ARE ESSENTIALLY THINGS THAT ARE MORE EGREGIOUS AND REALLY DO REQUIRE THAT IN PERSON APPROACHED MY LIFE IN OCTOBER STATE AND SO WE DID NOT AND GOING OUT INTO FACILITIES ONLY AND WE DO INTEND THREE ZERO ARE IN FIRST PERSON INFECTIONS IN APRIL- I WILL JUST SAY YOU KNOW BASED ON MY EXPERIENCE WITH THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES- DIRECTOR PREVIOUSLY AND AS A AS A CARE PROVIDER- DATE I DO KNOW ABSOLUTELY WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IN TERMS OF B. THE PERCEPTION OF LICENSING AND I WILL SAY THAT OUR DIRECTOR DIRECTOR JOHNSON WHO DID. COME FROM THE CHILD I TITLED HEARD BACKGROUND WAS ABSOLUTELY COMMITTED IN SOME OF THE RESTRUCTURING SHE'S DONE IN THE DEPARTMENT TO BE ABLE TO PRINT SURE THAT WE ARE BEING READ ON THAT I'M NOT ONLY IN PROVIDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE OR TRAINING FOR FACILITIES BUT IN TERMS OF PAYING THE- OVERSIGHT AND FIRST I ROLE. THAT WE TAKE pABSOLUTE COMMITTED TO ENSURING WE'RE DOING THINGS AND THE TIME WAY IN A CALM. WAY FROM. OUR LIFE. FIRST AHA. AND THEN FOR. MIGHT FIND QUESTION IS AROUND THE ADULT AND SENIOR FOR- MANY THEM ARE COMING OFF. PEOPLE HAVE CHALLENGES WITH HOW THE RATES ARE SO LOW- 'VE ACTUALLY SEEN A LOT OF THIS HAPPEN I MY OWN DISTRICT- AND SO JUST WANTED YOUR THOUGHTS ON WHAT YOU'RE- NOW DOING TO. MAKE SURE THAT OUR SENIORS AND VULNERABLE ADULTS ARE ABLE TO STAY IN THESE FACILITIES IS THERE A PLAN- SOME SORT OF PRACTICES AND POLICIES THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO EMPLOY. YEAH ABSOLUTELY SO THROUGHOUT THE PANDEMIC WE CERTAINLY ONCE AGAIN HAD TO BALANCE OUR ROLE OF PRESERVING OUR FACILITIES ENSURING THAT THEY WERE ABLE TO SUSTAIN THROUGH THE PANDEMIC AND EVEN BEFORE THE PANDEMIC INSURING THAT WE HAD. ENOUGH OPPORTUNITIES AND ARE CONTINUING TO CARE FOR AGING AND DISABLED ADULTS TO BE ABLE TO MEET THEIR THEIR HOUSING NEEDS IN THEIR LONG TERM. AND THROUGH THE MASTER AN AGING OUR DEPARTMENTS AND HEAVILY INVOLVED IN LOOKING AT OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE MAY HAVE A STATE TO BE ABLE TO WORK AND THOSE OPPORTUNITIES THOSE IN YOUR LONG TERM CARE OPPORTUNITY. FOR ADULTS AND SENIORS- WE HAVE SEEN EVEN THOUGH THE NUMBER OF FACILITIES THAT SERVE OUR SFI COMMUNITY- HAS INCREASED OVER TIME WE HAVE SEEN A DECREASE. IN FOLKS RECEIVING SSI ARE LOW INCOME INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE RESIDING IN THOSE FACILITIES AND THAT IS ABSOLUTELY A CONCERN FOR US BECAUSE WE DO WANT TO ENSURE THEIR- ARGUS LADIES HAVE THAT THE FUNDING AND THE RESOURCES NECESSARY TO REALLY HAVE OPPORTUNITIES TO SERVE THE MOST VULNERABLE CALIFORNIANS SINCE THE- ONE SUCH OPPORTUNITY IS THE COMMUNITY CARE EXPANSION PLANS- WHICH IS BEING PROPOSED. TO BE ABLE TO ASSIST OUR RESIDENTIAL CARE FACILITIES FOR THE ELDERLY AND OUR ADULT RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES TO BE ABLE TO- PURCHASED THEIR FACILITIES THIS WOULD BE CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS ARE PURCHASED AS- AS ONE OPPORTUNITY TO OFFSET THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH OPERATING THESE FACILITIES. WE'RE ALSO EXPLORING SEVERAL OTHER OPTIONS THAT WOULD BE ABLE TO HELP WITH THIS AND I'M SHOULD THERE BE ANY PROPOSALS THAT WOULD. BE AND THAT MAY REVISED. OKAY I YOU KNOW I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR- RESPONSE. I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT I WAS SO ALARMED ARM KIND OF LOOKING INTO- THE REPORTS AROUND THESE YOUNG FOLKS AND THE ABUSES- AND THE DEATH I CERTAINLY HOPE THAT. YOU ALL WERE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO REVAMP THE DEPARTMENT BEFORE AN ARTICLE CAME OUT IT'S ALWAYS SUSPECT TO ME WHEN FOLKS DECIDE TO MAKE CHANGES YOU KNOW AFTER SOMETHING ABOUT IN THE NEWS IT AND MAKES PEOPLE QUESTION- THEIR TRUST AND DEPARTMENTS AND IN GOVERNMENT AND WHY THINGS AREN'T BEING ADDRESSED BEFORE. AN INVESTIGATIVE REPORT COMES OUT BUT- IT ALSO REALLY HAS INFORMED AND AFFIRMS THE WORK THAT IS HAPPENING BY SO MANY FOLKS IN THE PUBLIC SAFETY SPEAR SPEAR. AROUND RAMA INFORM SYSTEMS AND YOU KNOW HOW WE WORK AND LOOK MORE COMPREHENSIVELY AND COMPASSIONATELY. AT THE CRIMINAL LEGAL SYSTEM YOU KNOW IF OUR CHILDREN GROW UP AND ACTUALLY CREATE HARM. WE GUILTY IF IT'S BECAUSE WE'VE ALLOWED THEM TO BE TREATED THIS WAY- AND THAT'S HOW I KIND OF SEE THIS SO I'M HOPEFUL THAT- MORE. AGGRESSIVE CHANGES AND REFLECTION WILL BE HAPPENING WITH THE DEPARTMENT SO THAT WE DON'T CONTINUE TO- GET STORIES LIKE THIS IN HERE ABOUT THE DEATHS OF YOUNG PEOPLE. ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU I DO HOPE TO BRING MY- SOCIAL SERVICE BACKGROUND AND EXPERIENCE IN OVERSEEING CHILD WELFARE IN ART AMERICANS COUNTY TO THE TABLE HERE TO INFORM COMMUNITY CARE LICENSING I'M ALSO APPRECIATIVE EYES CENTER COME LONGER AND AB ONE EIGHTEEN THAT I KNOW. YOU ARE WORKING ON WITH OUR DEPARTMENTS TO FIND OTHER STRATEGIES FOR TRAUMA INFORMED CARE AND BRAND BRINGING OPPORTUNITIES FOR CRISIS THE ESCALATION AND- INTERFACING WITH UNITY'S PRIOR TAX LAW ENFORCEMENT YOU NEED TO GET INVOLVED I THINK THAT'S A VERY IMPORTANT PIECE OF. WORK AND LOOK FORWARD. TO PARTNERSHIP IN THE FUTURE. THANK YOU SENATE. SENATOR GROWTH. THANK YOU MADAM PRO TEM- THE GOOD SENATOR FROM LOS ANGELES AFTER OF QUITE A FEW QUESTIONS THAT I WAS GOING TO ASK SO I JUST WANT TO FOLLOW UP JUST A LITTLE BIT- YOU KNOW I UNDERSTAND ABOUT THE FACILITIES THAT REALIZE THAT WERE- CERTIFIED OUT OF STATE WHERE WE HAD TRAGEDIES TAKE PLACE.

TO THE EXTENT THAT WE CAN BUILD OUT MODELS THAT CREATE- MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR YOU TO BE ABLE TO FIND SUPPORT NETWORKS ACROSS THE SPAN OF THEIR LIVES WE ARE ABSOLUTELY- WORKING ALONG SIDE BOTH ARE COUNTY PARTNERS ARE STAKEHOLDERS AND- PRIVATE PROVIDERS AS WELL AS THE OTHER DIVISIONS WITHIN. CDSS TO DO. AND WOULD BE HAPPY TO BACK TO YOU WITH MORE. ABOUT SOME OF THE STRATEGIES AND SOME OF THE SUPPORT THAT WE ARE PROVIDING ARE CONSIDERING. A PRE SHAPE THAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU- CENTER LAYERED. WELL ONE THE CENTER BATES AND I SERVED IN THE ASSEMBLY THERE WAS ONE OF HER COLLEAGUES FROM ORANGE COUNTY. BY THE TIME HE WAS DONE. HAD APPEARED TO HAVE EVERY JOB KNOWN TO HUMANKIND. AND I HAVE AGED INTO THAT CAR SO I'VE WORKED FOR OUR LOCAL SOCIAL SERVICES DEPARTMENT FOR FEW YEARS. AND LET ME JUST SAY I APPRECIATED- CENTER CALM WATERS QUESTIONS THEY REALLY MATTERED WHAT I WOULD ASK I THINK YOU'RE EMINENTLY QUALIFIED NINE LOOK FORWARD TO VOTING FOR YOUR CONFIRMATION I DON'T HAVE ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS. THANK YOU SENATOR SENATOR BATES. THANK YOU AND- THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE. QATARI IF PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT DEPARTMENTS THAT WE HAVE IN IN OUR STATE IN TERMS OF REACHING OUT TO THOSE WHO PROBABLY HAVEN'T BEEN PROVIDED THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT AND MAYBE THE REST OF US HAVE AND YOUR JOB IS TO LIFT THEM UP AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY TO MOVE OUT- INTO WHAT IS THE CALIFORNIA DREAM LET'S SAY AND I ONCE UPON A TIME. I WAS THERE DOING THAT FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC SOCIAL SERVICES AND LOS ANGELES COUNTY OF THE MATTER OF FACT SO I KNOW THE CHALLENGES THAT ARE THERE I RECENTLY BEEN VERY INVOLVED IN THE SITUATION WITH THE RESIDENTIAL CARE FACILITIES AND THE DIMINISHMENT OF THOSE CUT BY MY BROTHER GOD REST HIS SOUL HE DID PASS AWAY THAT IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO FIND A PLACE FOR HIM- BECAUSE HE NEEDED- HE HE BELIEVES HE LIVE. MORE INDEPENDENT THAN WHAT THAT SAY THAT THAT TIE IN HARRODS- ACTUALLY CASH BUT NOTHING ELSE SO WE WERE GOING THROUGH THE CASH LIKE CRAZY IN FACT HE DID PASS AWAY. YOU KNOW JUST BEFORE KOBE AND I IT WAS PROBABLY A BLESSING BECAUSE HE WAS HAD REALLY DETERIORATED AT THAT TIME THAT IF HE HAD LVED MUCH LONGER WE WOULD HAVE RUN OUT OF MONEY AND THE FACILITY OPERATED TOLD ME HE WOULD HAVE TO BE TO A MEDIC CAL. OUR SITUATION AND THERE WAS NOTHING IN THE REGION SO I AM REALLY CONCERNED AND I'M I LIKE THE QUESTION THAT SENATOR COM LONGER AFTER ON THIS VERY ISSUE THAT WE ARE REALLY WORKING HARD TO FIND PLACES ARE FOR PEOPLE WHO DO USE UP ALL OF THEIR RESOURCES AND FIND THEMSELVES IN THAT SITUATION BECAUSE THERE'S NO PLACE TO MOVE THEM. SO THE QUESTION WOULD BE DO THEY BECOME PART OF THE HUGE GROWING HOME ENOUGH YEAH WHO HAVE THAT PARTICULAR ISSUE NOT THAT THEY HAVE SUBSTANCE ABUSE NOT THAT THEY HAVE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES THEY JUST DON'T HAVE MONEY TO SUPPORT THEMSELVES AND PERHAPS NO FAMILY THAT CAN STEP BEYOND. SO I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU FOR FOCUSING ON THAT I KNOW THERE'S TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IF I LOOK AT THE BUDGET. CORRECTLY THAT'S BEING ERECTED TO WORK WITH THE- DOT.

MY FABULOUS COLLEAGUES AT THE DEPARTMENT OF REHABILITATION AND MANY MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY- WITH ME BIRCH THING IS MY FATHER CHARLES NEW JERK ALL THE WAY FROM MY HOMETOWN OF DETROIT MICHIGAN- MADE LOCAL FAMILY DON HUGHES AND SAM HUGHES. AS A TRANSGENDER WOMAN WHO. WAS BORN WITH A SIGNIFICANT DISABILITY AND THE CHILD OF A HOLOCAUST SURVIVOR WHO CAME TO THIS COUNTRY AS A REFUGEE. I AM INCREDIBLY PROUD TO WORK FOR A DEPARTMENT- WHOSE MISSION INVOLVES EMPLOYMENT INDEPENDENCE AND EQUALITY FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. ARE AFTER US. AN OVER THIRTY YEAR CAREER WORKING AS A CIVIL RIGHTS ATTORNEY- I WANTED TO COME TO THE DEPARTMENT OF REHABILITATION IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN- BECAUSE I HAVE WORKED CLOSELY WITH THE DEPARTMENT. ON VARIOUS EMPLOYMENT ISSUES SEEKING TO FURTHER EMPLOYMENT FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. SERVED AS CHIEF COUNSEL OF THE DEPARTMENT OF REHABILITATION. SINCE TWENTY EIGHTEEN. MAY I HAVE THE HONOR AND PRIVILEGE OF ACTING AS CHIEF DEPUTY STARTING LAST JANUARY- AND ALSO THE HONOR OF BEING APPOINTED AS THE CHIEF KATHY IN JULY OF TWENTY TWENTY EIGHTH FROM HAVING GROWN UP WITH THE A SIGNIFICANT DISABILITY I HAD THE BENEFIT OF. SUPPORTS AND SERVICES THROUGH THE SCHOOL SYSTEM. HI UNDER WHEN IT WORK EXPERIENCE- UNDER A FEDERAL PROGRAM THE DOCTOR RIDDLE MENTIONED SIDA- OFFERING- SUPPORTS FOR PEOPLE ARE FROM LOW INCOME BACKGROUNDS AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. AND FROM THAT EXPERIENCE I KNEW HOW IMPORTANT IT WAS ARE FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES TO- BE OFFERED THE OPPORTUNITY D. TO WORK. I ULTIMATELY TO OUT SCHOOL AND DEVOTED MY MIKE TO SUR THAT. COMMUNITY AND AGAIN I CROWDEN ON TO BE HERE- YEAH I THINK HE FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE. THANK YOU SO MUCH- WELL SENATOR KAMLAGER WOULD YOU LIKE TO KICK US OFF AGAIN YOU DID SO WELL LAST TIME ARE YOU SURPRISED ALL OF US FROM HAVING TO ASK THE QUESTION WHY THEY LIEU ASK SO THIS MAY BE A BURDEN TO. BEAR I WILL GIVE IT ANOTHER GO THANK YOU- PRO. MADAM CHAIR WELL I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU MISTER. MODRIC FOR YOUR- CONTINUES SERVICE I ONLY HAVE A- A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS FOR YOU- YOU KNOW I WANTED TO START BY SAYING I HAVE A STEP SON WHO WAS- DIAGNOSED WITH AUTISM AT A VERY. YOUNG AGE AND SO WE- WORK QUITE CLOSELY WITH THE REGIONAL CENTER. AND IN READING OF THE BINDER ON YOU I WAS STRUCK BY A CONVERSATION THAT I ACTUALLY IT HAD SOMETIME AGO WITH A PARENT OF AN ADULT CHILD WITH DISABILITIES. AND WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE CHALLENGES HIS SON WAS HAVING WITH FINDING EMPLOYMENT AND FINDING LONG TERM EMPLOYMENT AND HOW TO IDENTIFY FRIENDLY EMPLOYERS TO THE DISABILITY COMMUNITY AND HOW TO MAKE SURE THAT HIS SON- WOULD NOT BE SHOVED INTO LOW WAGE. JOBS WITH VERY FEW PROTECTIONS AND SO I WAS JUST WONDERING IF YOU COULD SPEAK TO YOUR LEADERSHIP IN THIS SPACE AND SORT OF YOUR VISION AND THE WORK THAT HAS BEEN HAPPENING IN THE DEPARTMENT AROUND KIND OF PROTECTING THESE COMMUNITIES- AND ENSURING THAT THEY ALSO HAVE EQUAL OPPORTUNITY TO YOU KNOW DIGNIFIED. LONG TERM EMPLOYMENT- WHERE YOU KNOW THE WAGES ARE FAIR- AND WHERE THERE'S ACTUALLY A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THAT PARTICULAR ADULT WITH DISABILITIES AND EVEN- THE FAMILY MEMBERS OR THE PARENTS WHO ARE STILL WORKING WITH THEM- BECAUSE THEY HAPPEN TO HAVE A DISABILITY. THANK YOU SENATOR FOR THE QUESTION SO MY INTEREST AND PASSION IN THIS AREA DATE- DATES BACK FAR FAR BEFORE I JOINED THE DEPARTMENT. AS DEPUTY DIRECTOR DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA I LED AN EFFORT AROUNDIMPROVING OUTCOMES FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. IN EVEN THOUGH I GREW UP WITH A DISABILITY I AND- PRACTICED LAW FOR DECADES I HAD NO IDEA THAT THERE IS A FEDERAL LAW AND STATE LAW. THAT ALLOWED EMPLOYERS TO PAY CERTAIN PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES LESS THAN MINIMUM WAGE. AND AND THE RECIPIENTS OF THOSE WAGES LARGE PART OF PEOPLE WITH INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES WHICH INCLUDES ON AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER- I PARTICIPATED IN ADVOCACY- THAT BECAME HE NATIONAL TREND- THE TO. PROVIDE SUPPORT TO PEOPLE WITH INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES TO ALLOW THEM TO WORK IN COMPETITIVE INTEGRATED EMPLOYMENT. EARNING A SUSTAINABLE WAGE AND THAT'S ACTUALLY HOW I FOUND MY WAY TO THE DEPARTMENT OF REHABILITATION BECAUSE I SAW THAT PASSION AND COMMITMENT WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT. AS WELL AS IN OUR SISTER DEPARTMENTS THE DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES AND THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION- TO ACHIEVE THESE ENDS AND WE WE'VE BEEN WORKING FOR MANY YEARS ON THIS EFFORT WE'VE MADE STRIDES- THERE'S STILL ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT IN A WAYS TO GO. AND AND SPECIFICALLY TO YOUR QUESTION I THINK IT REALLY INVOLVES STARTING WITH INDIVIDUALS- WAY BEFORE THEY'RE READY FOR EMPLOYMENT- STARTING WITH THE EXPECTATION THAT CHILDREN IN YOU WILL WORK WILL IT WILL GO BEYOND- SECONDARY EDUCATION- AND- AND IT ALSO INVOLVES SOME THING THAT'S A ONE OF. ONE OF OUR AND DEBATE WHICH TO TREAT BUSINESS AS CLIENT AS A AS A CONSUMER AND TO SEEK OUT- TO FIND OUT WHAT THE NEEDS OF BUSINESSES ARE INTO ADVICE AND SUPPORT BUSINESSES IN REATING INCLUSIVE ENVIRONMENTS AND SO I THINK- REALLY COMPLICATED ISSUE- MULTIPLE BARRIERS AND- AND MULTIPLE OPPORTUNITIES- FOR US TO GROW. AND AND AGAIN WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT DONE BUT I THINK WE'RE WE'RE- WE'RE ON THE RIGHT PATH. THANK YOU AND THEN MY FINAL QUESTION. ISRAEL'S IS ABOUT COVERT I'M TRYING O GET AWAY FROM COBIT BUT IT'S THANK THINK IT'S STILL WITH US FOR A LITTLE WHILE LONGER- I'VE HAD A LOT OF CONVERSATIONS WITH CARE GIVERS OF- ADULTS WITH- SEVERE DISABILITIES. WHO WERE CHALLENGED DURING COVE IT BECAUSE OF THE RESTRICTIVE GUIDELINES THEY WERE YOU KNOW WEARING MASKS- FOR THOSE THAT HAVE SINCE RE CHALLENGES WAS REALLY TOUGH THE CONNECTIVITY WITH CARE GIVERS- THAT THEN HAD TO SORT OF HAPPENED VIRTUALLY OR- SPATIALLY DISTANCE BECAUSE A CODED- AND JUST WANTED TO KIND OF. ISSUE IF YOU COULD SHARE WITH ME LESSONS LEARNED AS A RESULT OF THE PANDEMIC AND SORT OF WHAT'S BEING DONE REALLY TO ADDRESS AND ACCOMMODATE THE NEEDS OF THIS PARTICULAR- COMMUNITY THAT HAS DIFFERENT AND VERY UNIQUE CHALLENGES. AS IT RELATES TO COLD COBIT AND HOW THEY'RE JUST ABLE TO LIVE AND MANAGE- AND THEY'RE NOT REALLY THINGS THAT WE THINK ABOUT- YOU KNOW FOR FOLKS WHO ARE ABLE BODIED- BUT THERE SEEM TO BE SO MUCH DISJOINTED MESS WITH REGARDS TO THE GUIDELINES THAT WE WERE SORT OF PUTTING OUT. AND THEN MAYBE NOT BEING- ADAPTABLE TO THE DISABILITY COMMUNITY. ABSOLUTELY NOT NO DOUBT THIS THIS PAST YEAR'S BEEN INCREDIBLY CHALLENGING FOR. US AS A NATION YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA IS A STATE- AND ANALYZE THE PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. EXCUSE ME- WE- AS AN ESSENTIAL SERVICE- PROVIDING- SERVICES TO PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AS MANY AS- STATE DEPARTMENTS DETERMINED WE I'M DETERMINED THAT WE WERE AN ESSENTIAL SERVICE AND THAT WE WERE NOT GOING TO CLOSE ANY OF OUR DOORS. WE KNOW THAT- SERVING WITH PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES THAT EVERY DISABILITY IS DIFFERENT AND EVEN WITHIN DISABILITY TYPES PEOPLE HAVE UNIQUE NEEDS AND DIFFERENCES AND OUR PERSPECTIVE IS TO TREAT PEOPLE INDIVIDUALLY AND MEET THEM WHERE THEY ARE AND PROVIDE AND WHAT THEY NEED AND SO. WE KNOW THAT SOME PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES NEED IN PERSON SERVICES AND WE- WE WERE COMMITTED TO KEEPING OUR DOORS OPEN AND- SINCE THE PANDEMIC STARTED- OF COURSE WE FOLLOW ALL GUIDELINES FROM THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH- AND- IN PROTECTING THE COMMUNITY AND IN PROTECTING- OUR STAFF. SUCH AS SOCIAL DISTANCING OUR PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT AND BOUGHT AND THE LIKE- WE ALSO VERY QUICKLY- WHEN AT THE STATE HOME ORDERS WERE ENTERED MOVED TO- ALMOST FULL- TELEWORK OR STAFF WHO WERE NOT REQUIRED TO BE IN THE OFFICE SO- BEGAN COURTING CONSUMERS WHO CAME IN AND- TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE PER BURKE SUPPORTING FULL TIME. TELEWORK OVER 75% OF OUR STAFF OVER THE PAST YEAR HAVE BEEN- TELEWORKING- NOT AS YOU'VE INDICATED NONE OF THE PROVISION OF SERVICES HAS BEEN PERFECT- BUT WE HAVE WE HAVE- LEARN SOME THINGS THROUGH THIS EXPERIENCE SO WE. WE KNOW NOW- HOW WELL WE PROVIDE REMOTE SERVICE WHEN THEY WORK FOR CONSUMERS AND WHEN AND WHEN THEY'RE APPROPRIATE AND THERE ARE MANY BENEFITS TO- I INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SUPPORTS TO- PROVIDE SERVICES REMOTELY TO CONSUMERS SO AGAIN. NO NO NO PERFECT SOLUTION- PARTICULARLY IN THE IN THE EXAMPLES YOU'RE CITING- BUT A BUT WE WE'VE WE'VE TRIED OUR BEST TO- BALANCE MEETING THE NEEDS OF OUR CONSUMERS. AND IN PROTECTING ON THE COMMUNITY SO MUCH AND JUST WANNA SAY THOSE ARE VERY BEAUTIFUL FLOWERS THAT YOU HAVE ON YOUR DESK. MAKING ME VERY HAPPY. THANK YOU. IT THANK YOU SENATOR CENTER GROVE. THANK YOU AGAIN I APPRECIATE THE SENATE PRO TEM A CALLING ON OUR COLLEAGUES FROM LOS ANGELES BECAUSE SHE CAN ASK THE QUESTIONS THAT- THAT I HAD LAID OUT AS WELL THAT SAVES TIME I HAVE A BIG HEART FOR THE DD COMMUNITY I WAS ABLE TO SERVE AND I JUST HAVE ONE WHEN I WAS IN THE ASSEMBLY AND- JUST FELL IN LOVE WITH A COMMUNITY THAT TO THEM. THIS IS A GET THE SERVICE THAT IT DESERVES- RECENTLY WE HAD DEAD JIM BALDWIN IN OUR LOCAL KERN COUNTY BAKERSFIELD ARC RETIRE I THINK HIS BIGGEST- HIS BIGGEST ACCOMPLISHMENT AND HIS BIGGEST OUR ROLE IN THE ART THE BAKERSFIELD ARC WAS TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERY INDIVIDUAL OR CONSUMER THAT WAS IN THAT FACILITY. I FELT A SENSE OF PRIDE- BY TRYING TO GETTING THEM EMPLOYED- AND I KNOW THAT IS THE MISSION OF PROVIDING EMPLOYMENT AND INDEPENDENCE FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES IS THAT IS- ON YOUR TOP TEN LIST IF NOT TALK. TO LAST. A BIT IN THE RESPONSE IN THE RULES COMMITTEE PACKET. YOU SAID THAT- BASICALLY 70% OF INDIVIDUALS BETWEEN THE AGES OF SIXTEEN AND SIXTY FOUR STILL UNEMPLOYED- CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT YOU THINK THOSE BARRIERS ARE AND- HAS ANY LEGISLATION IN THE PAST AFFECTED THAT EMPLOYMENT BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE TO ME THAT'S A LOT HIGHER THAN IT WAS WHEN I. THEN WHEN I WAS IN THE ASSEMBLY. THANK YOU SENATOR- ABSOLUTELY IT'S AN UNACCEPTABLE PERCENTAGE AND THAT'S THAT'S WHY THE-DEPARTMENT REHABILITATION OR VOCATIONAL REHABILITATION. OUR PARTNERS ACROSS THE COUNTRY EXISTS- WE HAVE YOU KNOW WE LEARN CONTINUOUSLY AND WE MAKE CHANGES CONTINUOUSLY TO SEEK TO. IMPROVE THOSE EFFORTS- WE- SINCE TWENTY FOURTEEN WE ARE. UNDER A FEDERAL MANDATE WE BELIEVE. IN BECAUSE IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO WE'VE HAD A I'M MORE FOCUSED- EFFORTS TO ENGAGE EMPLOYERS. AND TO- CONSIDER EMPLOYERS AS US CLIENTS AND PROVIDE THEM WITH TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND ADVICE- AND TO PARTNER WITH AND TO. TO EMPLOY PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES- I DON'T KNOW- THE TRAJECTORY OF THE PERCENTAGE AND WHETHER IT HAS GONE DOWN OVER WHAT. I'M HAPPY TO GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT- I DO THINK YOU KNOW BARRIERS ARE ARE COMPLICATED AND SOME OF WHAT WE'VE ALREADY TALKED ABOUT I THINK THAT. YOU KNOW SOME OF THE BARRIERS START WHEN PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES ARE ARE VERY YOUNG AND- YOU KNOW TYPICAL QUESTION OF- YOU KNOW VERY YOUNG CHILDREN IS WHAT DO YOU WANT TO BE WHEN YOU GROW UP AND SOMETIMES WE DON'T. ASK THOSE QUESTIONS. OF PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AND PARTICULARLY PEOPLE WITH SIGNIFICANT DISABILITIES AND- AND WE'VE SEEN SHIPS AND IN THOSE ATTITUDES WITH- WITH- THE INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES EDUCATION ACT THE ABA. INTEGRATION YOU KNOW. SOCIAL CHANGE TAKES TIME AND DECADES AND- SO I DO BELIEVE WE'VE WE'VE MADE STRIDES ALONG THE WAY BUT- BUT YES THERE THERE ARE THOSE BARRIERS- THERE ARE BARRIERS TO- TO INDIVIDUALS- ACCESSING. THE SERVICES THAT THEY NEED- TO GET SUPPORT TO ME AND RE THEM. AND THERE ARE ADDED TO VERY- IN- WITH WITH THE NOTION THAT WITH DISABILITIES ARE UNABLE TO WORK FOR TO BE PRODUCTIVE AND SO I'M WORKING ON ALL OF ALL OF THOSE ASPECTS OF THIS- OF THIS SITUATION. I HAVE A- I HAVE A PERSONAL FRIEND WHO HAS IT AS SEVERELY AFFECTED DOWN SYNDROME A CHILD HE IS A ARE SEIZE TWENTY FOUR NOW- AS- IS TWENTY FOUR. YOU KNOW IT WHEN HE WAS SIXTEEN HE WANTED TO DRIVE SO WE TALK ABOUT DRIVING IN THE COUNTRY IT WAS A VERY EFFECTIVE BUT- HE GOT TO DRIVE AND THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS VERY IMPORTANT TO HIM. HE ALSO HAD A JOB- WHERE HE WENT TO WORKING IMPACT IS LUNCH EVERY DAY ONE OF THOSE- WHAT LUNCH BECAUSE THAT MY GRANDPA USED TO KERRY RIGHT WITH THE BLACK WHEN IT WAS KIND OF. THE SHAPE LONG WAYS IN THE LEAGUE CAME AT- IS VERY PROUD OF THAT LUNCH PAIL AND IT TOOK A LOT OF PRIDE- FOR HIM TO BE ABLE TO GET UP EVERY MORNING HE SET HIS ALARM AND- HE GOT READY AND HE WAITED FOR- THE BUS TO PICK HIM UP SO THAT HE COULD GO DO THIS JOB. AND HE HAD SUCH A HIGH SENSE OF PRIDE TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS JOB AND AGAIN I DON'T ADVOCATE FOR PEOPLE TO GET PAID- LESS THAT YOU KNOW LIKE A LOW WAGER LOW LOWER WAGE THAN MINIMUM WAGE. BUT YOUR JOB DISAPPEARED WHEN THE LEGISLATURE PASSED A PIECE OF LEGISLATION CITY HAD TO BE PAID AT LEAST MINIMUM WAGE. AND BECAUSE GARRETT DURING THE DAY EVEN THOUGH HE TOOK PRIDE IN THAT POSITION HE COULD PROBABLY PRODUCE- LESS THAN 10% OF WHAT PAIN SOMEBODY OUT MINIMUM WAGE WAS. AND EVEN THOUGH HE GOT LESS THAN MINIMUM WAGE IT WAS HIS MONEY THAT HE EARNED AND- AND HE TOOK PRIDE IN IT GAVE HIM A SENSE OF PURPOSE A. GEERTS HIS PERSONALITY AND EVERYTHING CHANGED. WITH HIS FAMILY AFTER HE LOST THAT JOB HE GOT DEPRESSED HE- THERE WAS A LOT OF THINGS THAT HAPPENED SO I THINK WITH THE GOOD INTENT THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT EVERYBODY GETS AT LEAST A MINIMUM WAGES IS THE INTENTION AS WELL. BUT I THINK FOR PEOPLE LIKE GARRETT AND THERE ARE MANY OF THEM PROBABLY IN THE SEVENTY PERCENTILE THAT ARE NOT WORKING I THINK THAT- AFFECTS THEM AND I THINK WE SHOULD LOOK AT. THE SERIOUSLY LOOK AT THIS IS MY OPINION I THINK WE SHOULD LOOK AT SERIOUSLY ALLOWING- INDIVIDUALS WITH SEVERE DISABILITIES. INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES TO BE ABLE TO. HAVE THESE OF JOB THAT THAT. EMPLOYERS ARE WILLING TO BRING THEM ALONG AND LET THEM FEEL VALUED AND LET THEM AND PARTICIPATE. AND EVEN THOUGH THEY MIGHT ONLY PUT THREE CANS ON THE SHELF IN AN HOUR- WITH SOMEBODY ELSE COULD STOP MORE. OF IT THEY STILL HAVE THAT SENSE OF PRIDE AND IN THE END HAVING A JOB- WITH THAT PARTICULAR PERSON I'M TALKING ABOUT. HAD A- WHERE THEY CLEAN TO THAT THE- REST STOPS- THE STATE REST STOPS UP ON THE GRAPEVINE IN. THE HE WHO WAS JUST SO HAPPY TO HAVE THAT JOB. N. M. SO ANYWAYS AND HE'S DONE OTHER JOBS AS WELL. AT WILL WHAT DO YOU THINK. I THINK THIS NUMBER THE 70% NUMBER IS HIGHER NOW- THAN IT WAS WHEN I WAS IN THE- ASSEMBLY. DO YOU THINK THAT. PASSING THAT PIECE OF LEGISLATION WELL INTENDED WELL INTENDED. AFFECTED PEOPLE LIKE GARRETT FROM BEING ABLE TO BE- EMPLOYED. BOTH HER FIRST I'M SORRY TO HEAR THAT STORY I THINK I DO I DO AGREE WITH YOU THAT THAT IT'S UNFORTUNATE- I WANT TO INDICATE THAT- THE LOSS HAS NOT PHASED OUT- SOME MINIMUM WAGE- OR SHELTERED WORKSHOPS AT THIS POINT- IT I BELIEVE THAT THE LAW THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IS THE EMPLOYMENT FIRST BILL WHICH- I RECOGNIZE THAT IN CALIFORNIA. BERMAN IS THE FIRST- AND PREFERRED OUTCOMES FOR PEOPLE WITH INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES- I THINK YOU KNOW WE ARE PARTNERS WITH THE DEPARTMENT FELDMAN ALL SERVICES CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION ON THE BLUEPRINT FOR- COMPETITIVE INTEGRATED EMPLOYMENT. AND WE REALIZE THAT THIS IS A REALLY DIFFICULT AND CHALLENGING ISSUE AND NOBODY IS ADVOCATING FOR TERMINATING PEOPLE WITH IDG TAKING AWAY THEIR JOBS TAKING AWAY THEIR- INDEPENDENCE AND CRIED- WITHOUT SOMETHING IN PLACE TO REPLACE THAT. AND SO I THINK THAT- I THINK WHAT HAPPENED IS UNFORTUNATE BUT IT'S CERTAINLY NOT THE INTENT OF WHAT WE'RE WORKING ON A STATE DEPARTMENTS WHICH IS TO- NOT ONLY POVIDE THE SUPPORTS NECESSARY FOR- INDIVIDUAL- LIKE GARRETT BUT ALSO TO PROVIDE THE SUPPORTS IN THE COMMUNITY. THAT ARE NEEDED FOR THINGS LIKE- JOB COACHING AND- JOB SUPPORTS AND SO AGAIN I I'M SORRY TO HEAR THIS STORY I AGREE WITH YOU IT'S UNFORTUNATE I THINK THAT- THAT THE INTENT AND OUR GOAL IS TO- IS TO. MOVE TO A PLACE WHERE PEOPLE LIKE YOUR IT CAN WORK ON IN THE COMMUNITY EARNING A SUSTAINABLE LEVEL OF WAGE AND- AND THAT'S WHAT WE BELIEVE HERE AT THE DEPARTMENT OF REHABILITATION. THAT WE SERVE PEOPLE WITH THE MOST SIGNIFICANT DISABILITIES AND WE LEAVE NO ONE BEHIND AND WE BELIEVE EVERYONE- IF. THEY CHOOSE TO CAN WORK. THANK YOU. CENTER LAYERED. WHY ARE THINGS DONE NOMINEES INTENSELY QUALIFIED LOOK FORWARD TO SUPPORTING OR HAVE NO QUESTIONS THANK YOU SENATOR SENATOR BATES.

AS THE FIRST BLACK WOMAN APPOINTED TO THIS BOARD I FEEL THE GRAVITY AND THE HONOR. THE FOLLOWING AND MR COLLIES FOOTSTEPS. ALSO JUMPED AT THE CHANCE TO SERVE ON THIS BOARD BECAUSE I ENJOY THE SPORT I THINK THE HORSES ARE BEAUTIFUL AND ELEGANT ATHLETES. THE JOCKEYS ARE MASTERFUL RIDERS AND DRIVERS I REALIZE WHAT A MY LIFELONG DREAMS WHEN I ATTENDED THE RACES AT DEL MAR MY SISTER AND NIECE ON A MILESTONE BIRTHDAY. WE HAD A WONDERFUL TIME WAGERING ON THE FORCES BASED ON THEIR NAMES AND THEIR LOOKS. THAT SAID MY ENTHUSIASM FOR THE SPORT IS MATCHED BY MY CONCERN FOR THE SAFETY OF THE ATHLETES.

THERE WAS A LOT OF CONCERN ABOUT THE DOUBTS THAT WERE. ACTUALLY SEEMING TO MULTIPLY THE FAN IN NEED A TRAP AND AT THAT TIME. THERE WAS A MOVE TO CREATE A SAFETY PANEL AND I KNOW THAT THAT DID HAPPEN. FOR SANTA ANITA RACETRACK BAY ACTUALLY- I THINK FOUND A NUMBER OF COURSE IS NOT FIT TO RUN IN RACES WAS THAT SAFETY PANEL OF. ESTABLISHING AND MY QUESTION ON THAT IN EITHER ONE OF YOU ANSWER THAT AND THE OTHER QUESTION I HAVE WOULD BE SPECIFICALLY TO MR DAVIS.

A YOUR YOUR- CONCERNED THERE IN YOUR VOTE ON THAT SO LET'S START WITH THE SAFETY PANELS. ARE WE HAVING SUCCESS IN GETTING THE OTHER TRACKS TO ESTABLISH. THOSE THEY SEEM TO BE. A REALLY GREAT ADDITION TO ENSURING SAFETY IN AND REVIEW IN TERMS OF THE- I GUESS THE ABILITY AND THE READY NOW SO I'LL FOR THE DIFFERENT. FORCES TO BE ON THE TRACK FOR PARTICULAR RACES. AND THEN OBVIOUSLY. THAT- LOS ALAMEDA MY STILL HAVE. A YOU MIGHT WANT TO SHARE THE WITH US IN THE STATE. THANK YOU FOR SENATE.

AND MADE A DETERMINATION THAT BECAUSE OF THAT YES RT. THAT WE HAVE ENHANCED BY MY RECENT SENATE LEGISLATION. WE COULD LOOK AT WHAT THE SAFETY RECORD WAS IN CONSIDER THAT DURING THE LICENSING PROCESS WE DID THAT IN DECEMBER AND THEY WERE THOSE OF US WHO DECIDED THAT WE WANTED TO KEEP IN A CUL STYLE LHASA'S LOS ALAMEDA. AND REVIEW IT AGAIN IN SIX MONTHS I HAD THE LICENSEE REQUESTED RECONSIDERATION AND CAME BACK IN JANUARY AND I MAINTAIN THE SAME VOTE THAT I HAD IN DECEMBER. I APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR MOVING WITH CAUTION ON THAT BECAUSE IT IS SOMETHING THAT REALLY NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED SO THAT WE KEEP THE SPORT ALL WITHOUT WITHOUT CRIES OUT THERE TOO AND THE SUPPORT THAT WAS I THINK VERY TROUBLING FOR ALL OF US SINCE IT'S KIND OF PART OF THAT- THE LITTLE THE AMERICAN HISTORY IN AND WAY BACK TO BE BEYOND THAT SO BEFORE THAT SO I SAY SO THANK YOU FOR THAT IT MAY BE AND THEN MR CASTELLANOS ARE YOU MIGHT SPEAK TO THE- SAFETY PANELS AND HOW YOU SEE THOSE WORKING. IF THERE HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN ESTABLISHES SOME OF THE OTHER TRACKS. THE BASIC DETAILS THANK YOU VERY MUCH SPECIFICALLY BATTLES THAT WERE ENACTED- HAVE BEEN VERY INSTRUMENTAL. IN NAY THIS SAFETY OF THE HORSES AND YES IT HAS JUST AS YOU SAID IT HAS BEEN PROBLEMS. THAT PRIOR. TO RACES AND EVEN POST RACE. THAT THEY GET LOOKED AT THE HORSES GET LOOKED AT AND- WHEN THEY GET A VALUE WAITED. PRIOR TO THE RACE OF THE EVALUATION IS. NOT UP TO PAR THEN THEY WILL BE- SCRATCHED. AND THEN AFTER THE RACE IF THE AGAIN IF THERE IS SOMETHING THAT HAS NOTICED OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT WITH THE HORSE- ANY TYPE OF SLIGHT INJURY OR ANY. ANYTHING AT ALL WOOD- INTERFERE WITH THEIR WITH THEIR RACING. THEN THEY WOULD ALSO. ARE GETTING PUT ON THE LIST SO- THEY WERE NOT BE RACE IN THE NEXT DAY OR IN.
