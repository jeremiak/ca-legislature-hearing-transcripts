GOOD AFTERNOON AND WELCOME TO THE FIRST HEARING OF THE JOINT RULES SUBCOMMITTEE ON SEXUAL HARASSMENT PREVENTION AND RESPONSE. SINCE OCTOBER BOTH THE ASSEMBLY AND THE SENATE HAVE TAKEN INITIAL STEPS TO ADDRESS SEXUAL HARASSMENT IN THE CAPITAL COMMUNITY. WE'VE ESTABLISHED A HOTLINE FOR VICTIMS TO CONNECT TO COUNSELING AND RESOURCES. BOTH HOUSES HAVE AGREED TO RELEASE INTERNAL RECORDS OF SUBSTANTIATED COMPLAINTS. AND PERHAPS MOST NOTABLY WITH COME TOGETHER WITH BIPARTISAN BICAMERAL APPROACH TO CRAFT NEW POLICIES ON SEXUAL HARASSMENT. THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE TODAY. AT THIS POINT I'D LIKE TO TURN IN MY VAULT MY COLLEAGUE AND VICE CHAIR SENATOR MITCHELL FOR ANY OPENING REMARKS YOU'D LIKE TO MAKE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY IN GOOD AFTERNOON. AS YOU ALL WILL HERE THROUGHOUT THE COURSE OF TODAY'S HEARING THAT WILL HAVE A NUMBER OF FACT FINDING HEARING TO THAT'S THE INTO THE HEARING PROCESS. WE LOOK FOR TO HAVING THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE INPUT TO OUR RESPECTIVE HOUSES IN THE JOINT RULES COMMITTEE ON A PLAN OF ACTION FOR GOING FORWARD. FROM MY PERSPECTIVE PUBLIC HEARINGS ARE ONLY ONE METHOD THAT THIS COMMITTEE WILL UTILIZE INFORMING OUR RECOMMENDATIONS. WILL HAVE A NUMBER OF CONVERSATIONS WITH EXPERTS IN HUMAN RESOURCE PRACTITIONERS. WHILE THE FOCUS HAS BEEN ON SEXUAL HARASSMENT THIS SUBCOMMITTEE FROM MY PERSPECTIVE MUST LOOK BEYOND TO THE ISSUE OF GENDER EQUITY AND CREATING A OVERALL CULTURE OF INCLUSION. HINTS THE TOPIC OF TODAY'S HEARING. WE NEED TO WORK COLLECTIVELY TO CREATE A CULTURE IN WHICH WOMEN ARE VALUED WOMEN ARE PERCEIVED AS EQUALS AND THAT EMPLOYEES HAVE MUTUAL RESPECT FOR EACH OTHER. AS MY CHAIR ONE INCIDENT MADE STRIDES THUS FAR BUT WE'RE CLEAR THAT NOW'S THE TIME TO REALLY PUSH THE ENVELOPE FORWARD TO CONTINUE TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT WORKPLACE CULTURE. AND THE ROLE WOMEN CAN AND MUST PLAY IN THE WORKPLACE HERE IN THE STATE CAPITAL AS WELL AS ACROSS OUR STATE AND COUNTRY. I REALLY APPRECIATE THIS CHANCE TO WORK COLLABORATIVELY WITH MY COLLEAGUES. ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRIEDMAN AND THIS UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY COME TOGETHER IN A BICAMERAL FASHION. AS. MY OUT HERE AND I HAVE DISCUSSED ON NUMEROUS OCCASIONS ALREADY WE KNOW THAT THIS IS. A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY WE HAVE. TO REALLY SET A PRECEDENT AND FORGE A PATTERN HOPEFULLY APPARENT IN PRACTICE WITH THE TWO HOUSES CAN COME TOGETHER. TO HAVE A CONVERSATION AND DEVELOP POLICY THAT GOVERNS THIS UNIT GOVERNS THIS UNIQUE PLACE CALLED THE LEGISLATURE WE'VE BEEN SO MUCH TIME IN OUR RESPECTIVE HOUSES. GOING TO THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS THIS IS A DIFFERENT OPPORTUNITY THAT I HOPE ALL OF US ALL OF YOU ARE AS EAGER AS THE CHAIRWOMAN AND I. TO UNDERTAKE AND FORGE A NEW PATH TOWARD SELF GOVERNANCE. WE ALSO GREATLY APPRECIATE OUR PANELISTS TODAY WHO WILL HELP US BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW TO CHANGE AND INFORM OUR CULTURE AND ENSURE THAT ALL OF OUR LEGISLATIVE EMPLOYEES AS WELL AS ALL THOSE WHO ENTER THE BUILDING ARE RESPECTED. AND FEEL SAFE THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU SENATOR WOULD ANY OTHER MEMBER OF THE COMMISSION OF THE COMMITTEE I LIKE TO MAKE SOME COMMENTS ISRAEL'S. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. AS WE COME TOGETHER IT IT'S CRUCIAL THAT WE NOT ONLY EXPLORE THE BEST PRACTICES FOR CHANGING pBUT ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WOULD AN ALLEGATION OF SEXUAL AROUSAL ARREST BEEN CAREERS. EVERYONE DESERVES TO BE PROTECTED. AND GET ACCESS TO DUE PROCESS. THE WELL BEING OF A BUSINESS RELIES ON THE MORALE OF ITS EMPLOYEES. BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY THE EXAMPLE SET BY THOSE IN POSITIONS OF POWER WITHIN THE ORGANIZATION. WE MUST EXPECT OUR LEADERS AND PEOPLE OF POWER TO SET THE EXAMPLE IN THE STADLER'S A POSITIVE CULTURE. IT IS UNFORTUNATE THAT IT HASN'T BEEN THE CASE FOR ALL THESE YEARS. S. CHANGING CULTURE WILL NOT COME OVERNIGHT. IT WILL COME AS A RESULT OF OUR DAY TO DAY CONVERSATIONS. OUR HARD WORK INTENDED TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM. AND OUR COMMITMENT TO CHANGE. I ALONG WITH ALL OF YOU I HOPE TO LEARN. HOW WE COULD TAKE PRACTICAL STEPS TO ENSURE THAT NO ONE IS IN A SITUATION WHERE THE FEAR OF RETALIATION PREVENTS THEM FROM SEEKING JUSTICE? WE'VE BEEN PROVIDED THIS FORUM TO MAKE OUR RESPECTIVE HOUSES BETTER. FOR EVERYONE THAT PARTICIPATES IN THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS. I ALONG WITH MY COLLEAGUES ON THIS COMMITTEE. I AM FULLY PERMITTED TO THIS PROCESS TO ENSURE THAT WE NOT ONLY CREATE ROBUST POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS. BUT THAT WE CREATE A CULTURE OF RESPECT. DIGNITY AND PREVENTION. I DO WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR. WELL CHAIR VICE CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE. THE MEMBERS AND LEADERSHIP ON BOTH SIDES FOR THEIR WORK. FOR OUR WORK AND I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING TOGETHER THANK YOU. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY. A SENATOR MORE LOCK. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR IT'S AN HONOR TO SERVE WITH YOU. ON THIS CRITICAL SUBJECT MATTER. I HAVE. I'VE BEEN HERE BEFORE. AND SO HAS SENATOR BATES WE WERE BOTH COUNTY SUPERVISORS IN TWENTY TWELVE WHEN WE HAD. ONE OF OUR KEY MANAGERS. WHO ALLOT OF OUR FEMALE EMPLOYEES? REQUESTED SOME ASSISTANCE IN. AND SO. AS A GROUP OF FIVE WE CAN MAKE CHANGES RATHER QUICKLY AND WE DID. BUT THE PROCESS HERE SEEMS TO BE MOVING A LITTLE. SLOWER AND I APPRECIATE THAT BECAUSE WE'RE NOT. DIFFERENT SETTING. BUT. WE FORTY HAD TO ASSEMBLY MEMBERS RESIGNED AND WE'VE GOT. SENATOR ON LEAVE OF ABSENCE. AND SO JUST LIKE ORANGE COUNTY HAD A BIG BLACK EYE IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE IT'S LIKE THE CAPITAL HAS A BIG BLACK GUY. YOU KNOW RIGHT NOW IN IT IT I'D LIKE TO. KEEP THINGS MOVE MAYBE A LITTLE. QUICKER SITE APOLOGIZING APPRECIATE ALL THAT YOU PUT TOGETHER. I WROTE A LETTER TO THE CHAIR JUDICIARY ON EIGHT QUESTIONS I'D LOVE TO SEE. ADDRESSED. I APPRECIATE THAT. A PROCESS BUT I STILL FEEL LIKE WE'RE JUST DOING THE THIRTY THOUSAND FOOT LEVEL MAYBE I WANNA GO. A LITTLE LOWER I DON'T SEE THAT. SECRETARY THE SENATE AS A PANELIST I DON'T SEE THE DIRECTOR OF RECHARGE THE PANELISTS AND SO MAYBE I GUESS I WOULD CONCLUDE BY SAYING. THAT. YOU'RE DECLARING THAT WE WILL DEVELOP REAL SOLUTIONS I APPRECIATE THAT. AND I JUST WANNA KNOW HOW WE'RE GOING TO ACCOMPLISH THAT HOW CAN WE HELP YOU. THANK YOU. MISS WALDRON. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I'LL JUST SAY COUPLE BRIEF WORDS WHEN WE TALK ABOUT CULTURE. IT'S REALLY. NOT SOMETHING THAT SAYS. SPROUTS UP OVERNIGHT. CULTURE IS SOMETHING THAT DEVELOPS OVER TIME THE SEEDS ARE SOWN YOU KNOW IN. THE OUTSIDE LIVE OUR LIVES OUR HISTORY OUR YOU KNOW OF TWO GENERATIONS. AND. IT'S SUCH AN IMPORTANT TOPIC. ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU KNOW AS MS REYES ALLUDED TO. THERE'S THAT POWER STRUCTURE WHEN YOU GET FROM A CULTURE THAT'S KIND OF BUBBLING UP AND THEN YOU. HAVE A POWER STRUCTURE WHERE THERE ARE SOME WHO ARE POWER LESS AND SOME WHO ARE. YOU KNOW FEELING. THAT NO ONE'S LISTENING THAT THEY DON'T HAVE ANY. WHERE TO TURN? THAT CAN REALLY CULTIVATE. YOU KNOW SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT NOW WE HAVE SEEN SPROUTED SO. THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT HEARING AND A LOT WILL COME OUT OF IT THAT WE'LL HAVE TO DIGEST OBVIOUSLY. AND. YOU KNOW WE ALL SHARE THE SAME COMMON GOAL OF. YEAH FINDING IT END TO THIS. YOU KNOW PROTECTING OUR VICTIMS IN MAKING SURE THAT YOU KNOW WE CAN CHANGE THIS CULTURE WHICH IS A BIG. PARADIGM SHIFT. THANK YOU. WOULD ANY OTHER. MIDDLE BY SENATOR LEYVA. THANK YOU THANK YOU. MADAM CHAIRMAN AND VICE CHAIR IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE ON THIS COMMITTEE THIS IS OUR MOMENT IN TIME THIS IS WHERE WE HAVE A REAL OPPORTUNITY TO. TO DO THE DEEP DIVE AFTER WE DO THE OVERVIEW BUT IT'S OUR MOMENT TIME TO CHANGE THE CULTURE THAT WE LIVE IN WE LIVE IN A CULTURE OF RAPE. IF WE ANYONE WAS WATCHING CNN TODAY AND THEY SAW WARY NOW SIR AND THE USA GYMNASTICS AND WHAT THAT MAN DID TO A HUNDRED AND SIXTY TWO YOUNG WOMEN. IS UNCONSCIONABLE AND IT'S NOT JUST HE IT IS THOSE WHO ENABLED AND THIS IS OUR MOMENT THIS IS WHERE WE AS WOMEN CAN HAVE EACH OTHER'S BACKS THIS IS WHERE MEN CAN SAY. DUDE THAT'S NOT COOL DON'T DO THAT WE ARE ALL RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS AND WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO CHANGE IT AND FIX IT. AND I'M CONFIDENT THAT WE KIM SO HAPPY TO BE HERE. SO JUST TO HIM REPLY A LITTLE TO THE SENATORS. QUESTION AND IT'S A GOOD QUESTION AND IT'S A QUESTION I THINK WE'VE ALL BEEN ASKING OURSELVES ARM. HOW QUICKLY DO WE MOVE I THINK ALL OF US PROBABLY WALKED IN THE DOOR WITH SOME IDEA OF WHAT OF OF? POLICIES THAT WE COULD IMPLEMENT THAT WOULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE. BUT I THINK WE OWE IT TO THE PUBLIC TO THE PEOPLE IN THIS BUILDING ARE REALLY INTO THE WHOLE STATE TO TAKE A DEEP DIVE INTO THESE ISSUES BECAUSE THEY'RE COMPLICATED. NOW SEXUAL HARASSMENT DIDN'T JUST DEVELOP OVERNIGHT. WE'VE HAD DECADES OF WORKPLACE IMBALANCES AND OF A CULTURE THAT'S CREATED THE SITUATION AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO SOLVE IT IN ONE HERE ARE NOT GOING TO SOLVE IT OVERNIGHT. WE HAVE OUR WE LEARNED IN THE LAST HEARING THAT THE ASSEMBLY HELD THAT OUR HUMAN RESOURCES DEPARTMENT HAS. POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT ARE VERY SIMILAR TO THOSE FOUND ACROSS CORPORATE AMERICA AND MANY OTHER PUBLIC AGENCIES AND YET WE STILL HAVE A PROBLEM. SO WE NEED TO REALLY TAKE THE TIME TO LOOK AT ALL OF THE ISSUES THAT ARE INVOLVED BECAUSE THEY'RE NEW WANTS THEIR NEW OSCAR. NUANCE BECAUSE OF OUR GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE THEIR NEW WANTS BECAUSE OF. THE WHERE OUR OFFICES ARE THERE NUANCED FOR VERY MANY REASONS THAT MAKE THEM A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT FROM A LOT OF OTHER PLACES. AND YET WE'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM AGENCIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA THAT HAVE HAD SIMILAR PROBLEMS AND HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ADDRESS THEIR ISSUES THROUGH POLICY CHANGES AND WE'RE GONNA HEAR FROM EXPERTS WHO HAVE BEEN STUDYING THIS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. TO LOOK AT BEST PRACTICES BOTH FOR PREVENTION AND TRAINING IMPORTANT FOR POLICIES AND FOR WAYS OF HOLDING PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE. WE HAVE ISSUES THAT WE HAVE TO LOOK AT INVOLVING TRANSPARENCY BECAUSE WE ARE ELECTED OFFICIALS THAT SOMETIMES IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE. EVEN SOME OF THE SOLUTIONS THAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT AS I SPEAK TO EXPERTS HAVE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES AND WE NEED TO IT EXAMINE ALL OF THOSE. SO WE ARE GOING TO TAKE A VERY DEEP DIVE SO BE READY BECAUSE WE'RE GONNA REALLY GET INTO THESE ISSUES AND TODAY IS GOING TO BE MORE OF A TWENTY THOUSAND. FOOT VIEW ABOUT CULTURE CHANGE AND HOW THAT'S DONE BUT AS WE PROGRESS FORWARD WE'RE GONNA START REALLY DRILLING DOWN INTO ALL OF THOSE AREAS. INTO TRANSPARENCY ISSUES INTO PRIVACY ISSUES INTO RETALIATION INTO ACCOUNTABILITY AND GO INTO THOSE IN DETAIL SO THAT BY THE END OF THIS. WE CAN TAKE. INGREDIENTS FROM OTHER AGENCIES FROM ALL OF THE EXPERTS AND TUNE THEM TO OUR PARTICULAR SITUATION ON OUR TYPE OF GOVERNANCE HERE IN THIS BUILDING WITH OUR CULTURE. WITH INFORMATION THAT WE'RE GETTING THROUGH OUR CULTURE SURVEY FROM OUR EMPLOYEES FROM INFORMATION WE GET FROM STAKEHOLDERS AND INPUT AND CREATES SOMETHING THAT I THINK WILL BE THE MODEL FOR THE WHOLE COUNTRY. AND I THINK THAT EVERYBODY HERE DESERVES US TAKING THE TIME TO DO THAT CORRECTLY AND UNAPOLOGETICALLY IN TO RELIEVE THAT ALL OF THOSE ISSUES BECAUSE WE MAY NOT BE HERE NO ONE MAY BE DOING THIS FOR TEN MORE YEARS MY HOPE IS. THAT WHAT WE DO HERE IS SO POWERFUL THAT NO ONE EVER HAS TO DO THIS AGAIN. SO I APPRECIATE THE QUESTION ARM BUT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE DISAPPOINTED I THINK IN THE INFORMATION THAT COMES OUT AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT I HAVE MY LISTENING EARS OPEN BECAUSE WE'VE GOT A LOT OF EXPERTS COMING IN. AND I'M REALLY ANXIOUS TO HEAR THEM. AND WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO GO AHEAD AND CALL OUR FIRST PANEL. THAT WAS THE PLAN OF ACTION. ARM WELL I CAN TELL YOU THAT WE YOU KNOW WE WE HAVE AGENDAS RIGHT NOW THAT THAT REALLY GET INTO THOSE ISSUES IN DEPTH AND THEIR EVOLVING AND CHANGING. BASED ON TESTIMONY THAT WE'RE HEARING AND PEOPLE THAT ARE BROUGHT TO US AND WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO BE FLEXIBLE ENOUGH BUT THOSE ARE THE MAIN ISSUES. TRANSPARENCY ISSUES NOT JUST HOW WE MAKE THINGS TRANSPARENT TO THE PUBLIC WHO HAS A RIGHT TO KNOW BUT MAKING SURE THAT OUR PROCESS IS UNDERSTANDABLE TO EVERYBODY WHO COMES IN CONTACT WITH THE BUILDING. BECAUSE EVERYBODY HAS A RIGHT TO THAT PROCESS WHETHER YOU'RE A LOBBYIST OR MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC OR AN INTERN OR AN EMPLOYEE OR AND OR REMEMBER. MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE REAL ACCOUNTABILITY THAT'S THAT'S NOT SUBJECTIVE THAT'S MORE OBJECTIVE BASED ON OBJECTIVE STANDARDS. I'M AND OF. THAT WE HAVE MUCH MORE PROTECTIVE. POLICIES THAT PREVENT RETALIATION AGAINST PEOPLE WHO BRING CLAIMS FOR AND AGAINST WITNESSES AS WELL. AND ALSO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE BEST PREVENTION AND TRAINING THAT WE CAN POSSIBLY HAVE SO THOSE ARE THE GENERAL AREAS NOTABLY EXPLORING. HOW WITHOUT LET ME BRING THE PANEL FOREIGN? PANEL IF YOU'D LIKE TO COME UP AND RATHER THAN READ YOUR BIOS I'M GOING TO ALLOW YOU. THE SPACE TO INTRODUCE YOURSELVES AS YOU SEE FIT. MEMBERS I WOULD. ASK THAT WE NOT ASK QUESTIONS OF EACH PANELIST UNTIL THE END BECAUSE WHO'S GOING TO BE SOME OVERLAP IN CONTENT AND SOMEBODY ELSE MIGHT ANSWER A QUESTION OR GIVE YOU ANOTHER QUESTION THAT YOU DIDN'T. SO LET'S HOLD QUESTIONS UNTIL THE END OF ALL THE PRESS. I'LL GO AHEAD AND AND BEGAN. MY NAME IS JANET DOWN HARD I'M THE NEW AND PROFESSOR OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION. AT THE UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA PRICE SCHOOL. IF I CAN OF SPEAKING FIRST I GUESS A CALF. I TEACH ORGANIZATIONAL BEHAVIOR LEADERSHIP AND ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE CHANGE. I'VE WRITTEN. FIVE BOOKS A ROOM GONE PUBLIC SERVICE VALUES ON LEADERSHIP. AND ALL OF WHICH TO A GREATER OR LESSER DEGREE OF DEALT WITH THE CONCEPT OF ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE. A I AM NOT AN EXPERT ON SEXUAL HARASSMENT POLICY BUT I DO BRING EXPERTISE ON ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE. AND HOW TO MANAGE I'M CULTURAL CHANGE. I'D LIKE TO BEGIN OF BY AND. DIRECTING YOUR ATTENTION TO THE TO THE. SLIDE BECAUSE I'M A TEACHER I DO POWER POINT. MY ROLE HERE TODAY IS IS TO SORT OF CREATE. GIVE YOU AN OVERVIEW OF WHAT ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE IS FROM AN ACADEMIC PERSPECTIVE WHY IT'S IMPORTANT. HOW ITS ESTABLISHED AND HOW IT CAN BE CHANGED? IN ITS SIMPLICITY A LOT OF VERY UNCOMPLICATED ACADEMIC DEFINITIONS OF ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE BUT I THINK THE SIMPLEST ONE IS. ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE IS THE WAY THINGS ARE REALLY DONE AROUND HERE. IT'S NOT THE STATED POLICIES ITS NOT THE STATED VALUES IF THE WAY THINGS REALLY WORK. BEHIND THE SCENES. ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE IS IN FACT BEEN. OFTEN LIKENED TO AN ICEBERG. UP AT THE TOP OF THE ICEBERG THAT WHICH IS VISIBLE ABOVE THE WATER. ARE THE STRUCTURES THE PROCEDURES THE POLICIES THE STATED PHILOSOPHY AND STRATEGY. BUT YOU'LL NOTE THAT THE BULK OF ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE IS BENEATH THE SURFACE. IT WHERE THOSE UNSPOKEN ASSUMPTIONS ARE WHERE THOSE BEHAVIORAL NORMS ARE THAT ARE INFORMALLY COMMUNICATED BUT VERY STRICTLY ENFORCED. SO WHY IS ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE IMPORTANT I REALLY APPRECIATE ALL THE COMMENTS I HEARD ABOUT HOW IMPORTANT CULTURE IS THIS IS NOT. THAT THIS CANNOT BE SOLVED BY ESTABLISHING A POLICY ALONE. ALL CHANGE OCCURS WITHIN A CULTURAL CONTEXT. AND I'D. YOU CAN CHANGE ALL OF THE FORMAL PROCEDURES YOU CAN CHANGE. OUT THE STRUCTURE THAT WON'T CHANGE ANYTHING INTO YOU AND CHANGE THE UNDER UNDERLYING CULTURE AS WELL. CULTURE GUIDES AND CONTROLS BEHAVIOR POLICIES ARE IMPORTANT RULES ARE IMPORTANT BUT CULTURE IS IS THE PRIMARY DETERMINED OF HUMAN BEHAVIOR AND ORGANIZATIONS. AND AS YOU KNOW IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR THERE ARE HIGHER STANDARDS AND MULTIPLE ACCOUNTABILITY IS MAKING THIS pMORE COMPLICATED AND MORE DIFFICULT I THINK CULTURAL CHANGE IN PUBLIC IMMIGRANT ORGANIZATIONS CAN BE MORE DIFFICULT BECAUSE OF THE QUESTION OF TRANSPARENCY. AND THE FACT THAT THERE ARE SO MANY DIFFERENT LEVELS OF ACCOUNTABILITY. PETER DRUCKER WHO IS A FAMOUS MANAGEMENT THEORISTS SAID CULTURE EAT STRATEGY FOR BREAKFAST. AND BY THAT HE MEANT THAT IF THERE IS A CONFLICT BETWEEN THE NORMS OF THE ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE AND THE RULES OF THE ORGANIZATION. CULTURE WILL WIN. MY COROLLARY TO THAT IS THAT CULTURE EATS POLICY FOR LUNCH. I AM IT'S THERE'S NO CONTEST IT UNLESS YOU CAN GET IN AND BEGIN TO. TO MOVE THE ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE IN A DIRECTION CONSISTENT WITH THE KINDS OF POLICIES AND NORMS THAT YOU WANT TO IMPLEMENT YOU YOU WILL NOT SUCCEED IN TERMS OF ORGANIZATIONAL CHANE. THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT. ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURES WHICH ARE BASED ON RESPECT INCLUSION. TRUST AND SAFETY ARE THE MOST PRODUCTIVE AND EFFECTIVE ORGANIZATIONS. THIS DOESN'T THIS IS JUST WORK HERE OF COURSE TODAY'S TALK ABOUT SEXUAL I'M HARASSMENT BUT THESE ARE THE QUALITIES OF ORGANIZATIONS. I'M ACROSS THE BOARD PUBLIC AND PRIVATE THAT LEAD TO MORE RESILIENT MORE PRODUCTIVE ORGANIZATIONS. OBVIOUSLY IF YOU WANT PEOPLE TO TAKE CALCULATED RISKS IF YOU WANT PEOPLE TO COOPERATE WITH EACH OTHER THEY HAVE TO TRUST EACH OTHER AND THEY HAVE TO FEEL SAFE AND THAT'S. EVERYONE IN THE ORGANIZATION NOT NOT JUST WOMEN. SO HOW IS CULTURE ESTABLISHED AND THE SHORT ANSWER IS IT'S ESTABLISHED VERY VERY SLOWLY. PROBABLY THE FOUNDERS OF INSTITUTIONS HAVE MORE OF A ROLE IN AND ESTABLISHING ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE THAN ANYONE ELSE. BUT IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO THAT TO REMEMBER THAT CULTURE IS COLLECTIVE. IT IS ENOUGH FOR ONE OR TEN PEOPLE TO SAY WE ARE GOING TO CHANGE THE CULTURE AND IT IS GOING TO BECOME THIS. CULTURE IS FRAMED COLLECTIVELY BY M. EVERY MEMBER OF THAT ORGANIZATION. AND SO EVERYONE NEEDS TO THINK DIFFERENTLY NOT JUST THE PEOPLE AT THE TOP. CULTURE IS ALSO BASED ON LEARNING AS NEW PEOPLE COME INTO THE ORGANIZATION CULTURE SHIFTS AS NEW IDEAS COME IN. I'M IN ALSO CHANGES IN RESPONSE TO EXTERNAL FORCES BELIEFS VALUES ASSUMPTIONS BROUGHT IN FROM THE OUTSIDE AND CERTAINLY THE NEWS THAT WE'RE HEARING. DAY AFTER DAY. IN IN HOLLYWOOD IN SPORTS IN I BUSINESS I'M IS HAVING AN EFFECT ON HOW WE VIEW OUR BEHAVIOR IN PUBLIC ORGANIZATIONS AND SO WE BRING THAT IN WITH US. PEOPLE LEARN CULTURE NOT BY BEING HANDED A HANDBOOK. I'M PEOPLE LEARN CULTURE BY GOING OUT TO LUNCH WITH PEOPLE. AND CULTURE IS COMMUNICATED THROUGH STORIES AND WHAT I'M SURE WHEN YOU CAME TO WORK HERE PEOPLE HAD STORIES ABOUT THINGS THAT PEOPLE HAD DONE IN WAYS THINGS THAT HAPPENED. SYMBOLS LANGUAGE JARGON. STATEMENTS OF PRINCIPLE ALL OF THOSE THINGS. INFLUENCE HOW WE LEARN CULTURE IN AN ORGANIZATION. AND CULTURES DIFFERS MARKEDLY FROM ORGANIZATION TO ORGANIZATION SO AND THE CALIFORNIA STATE LEGISLATURE HAS A CULTURE THAT IS UNIQUE. I'M BASED ON HIS HISTORY BASED ON THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN YEAR BASED ON THE STORIES THAT HAVE BEEN TOLD. SO THE GOOD NEWS IS THE CULTURE CAN BE CHANGED. I'M. THE BEST PRACTICES IN. ORGANIZATIONS. IS THAT YOU HAVE TO TALK ABOUT WHAT THE DESIRED BEHAVIORAL NORMS ARE ON A REGULAR BASIS. CULTURE CHANGES WHEN LEADERSHIP PAYS ATTENTION ON AN ONGOING BASIS. I AM SECOND. HOW SO? HOW AN ORGANIZATION REACTS THE CRITICAL INCIDENTS? AND AND EVENTS IS GOING TO BE WATCHED VERY VERY CAREFULLY THOSE WILL BECOME THE NEW STORIES THAT PEOPLE TELL. MODELING THE BEHAVIOR. REWARDING HIGHLIGHTING DESIRED BEHAVIOR. SAY THAT. SOME PART OF THE ORGANIZATION HOLDS A FORUM. WHERE I'M MEN AND WOMEN TALK ABOUT? WHAT THEIR CONCERNS ARE WHAT THEY WOULD NEED TO FEEL SAFE? WHAT THEY'RE WORRIED ABOUT IN TERMS OF THEIR OWN BEHAVIOR NOT BEING OFFENSIVE TO OTHER PEOPLE AND TO SHARE SUCCESSES AND TELL STORIES? OTHER ACTIONS ARE ALSO IMPORTANT BUT THEY WILL NOT GET A CULTURAL CHANGE THEY A INFLUENCE IT BUT THEY WILL NOT BE SUFFICIENT TO CHANGE OR SHIFT THE CULTURE. FORMAL STATEMENT OF POLICY. TRAINING ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE AND CHANGING THE THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THOSE THINGS ARE ALL IMPORTANT. BUT THEY ARE ALONE NOT ENOUGH AND AND I JUST MIGHT WANNA AND KNOW THERE THAT THE TRAINING THEY'RE. NOT JUST TRAINING FOR AND. HOW TO NOT HARASS BUT TRAINING ABOUT HOW TO BE A GOOD BYSTANDER HOW HOW TO BE? RESPECTFUL OF ALL PEOPLE. THERE IS ALWAYS RESISTANCE. YOU CULTURAL CHANGE THERE WILL BE RESISTANCE TO THIS CULTURAL CHANGE AND THE REASON FOR THAT. IS THAT PEOPLE OPERATE AND AND FIND THEIR SUCCESSES IN AN EXISTING CULTURE AND WHEN YOU CHANGE THAT CULTURE IT INTRODUCES UNCERTAINTY ABOUT HOW THEY WILL SUCCEED IN THE NEW CULTURE. IT ALSO INTRODUCES. UNCERTAINTY ABOUT HOW DOES HOW HOW TO ACT. THEY. WE CAN SAY DON'T DO THIS AND DON'T DO THAT BUT IF YOU'RE NOT TELLING PEOPLE IN A POSITIVE WAY WHAT WHAT KINDS OF BEHAVIOR YOU'RE TRYING TO INCULCATE. AND PAST EXPERIENCES PEOPLE DON'T HAVE GREAT EXPERIENCES WITH ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE AS OVITZ HANDLED INCLUSIVELY AND RESPECTFULLY I'M YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE BETTER LUCK. I'M. SOME SOME SORT OF BOND FOOD FOR THOUGHT. POSITIVE CULTURAL NORMS ARE BY FAR THE MOST EFFECTIVE. THAT IS. HELPING PEOPLE UNDERSTAND WHAT THE DESIRED BEHAVIOR IS. IS FAR MORE EFFECTIVE THAN SIMPLY EXPLAINING THE BEHAVIOR TO AVOID. IN OTHER WORDS PROHIBITING A BEHAVIOR DOES NOT. TELL PEOPLE HOW TO IN TURN BEHAVE. AND IT IS ALSO GOING TO CAUSE MORE RESISTANCE POSITIVE CULTURAL NORMS ARE FAR FAR MORE POWERFUL. AND CONSISTENT AND PERSISTENT REINFORCEMENT OF VALUES IS VERY IMPORTANT. AND WHETHER YOU DO THIRTY THOUSAND FEET OR DOWN IN THE IN THE DEBTS. THE IMPORTANT THING IS TO KEEP DOING IT AND IS IS NOT A ONE TIME EVENT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT HAS TO BE REINFORCED OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND  AND IT IS BEING STARTED NOW. AND THAT'S WHAT'S IMPORTANT YOU HAVE TO BEGIN. AND I WOULD COMMAND AS A CITIZEN I WOULD COMMEND THIS COMMITTEE FOR BEGINNING. CULTURE IS COLLECTIVE THE MORE INCLUSION THE BETTER. YOU DON'T WANT THIS TO BE A WOMEN'S ISSUE YOU DON'T WANT THIS TO BE AMENDS ISSUE THIS IS AN EVERYONE ISSUE. AND THIS IS ABOUT MAKING YOUR ORGANIZATION MORE PRODUCTIVE A AND A BETTER WORKPLACE FOR EVERYONE IN IT. ANOTHER WAY TO SAY THIS IF YOU LOOK DOWN AT THE BOTTOM IF YOU FOCUS ON RULES AND CONTROL IN ENFORCEMENT. YOU DO TRYING TO AVOID THIS BEHAVIOR AND AND PUNISHING THOSE WHO ENGAGE IN IT. YOU MAY GET COMPLIANCE BUT YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET COMMITMENT AND YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET CULTURE CHANGE. ORGANIZATIONS AND STRUCTURAL CHANGES ARE IMPORTANT IF THEY ARE DONE IN AN ENVIRONMENT OF EDUCATION A COMMUNICATION. ENGAGEMENT AND FACILITATION THAT'S WHERE YOU CAN GET THE COMMITMENT TO THE CULTURAL CHANGE. SO I WOULD LEAVE THE AND COMMITTEE WITH TWO QUESTIONS ONE IS. WHAT ARE THE CONSTRUCTIVE CULTURAL NORMS YOU WANNA FOSTER? NOT WHAT OF THE BEHAVIORS ARE TRYING TO AVOID WHAT IS IT THAT YOU WANT THIS WORKPLACE TO LOOK LIKE. I AND SECOND TO THINK CAREFULLY ABOUT WHAT THE GREATEST SOURCE OF CULTURE RESISTANCE TO CHANGE IS. IN IN THIS INSTANCE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU BEFORE WE GO TO THE NEXT PALACE LETTUCE WANT TO I'M LET THE PUBLIC IN THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS KNOW THAT WE'RE GONNA BE POSTING THESE POWER POINTS ON THE SUBCOMMITTEE'S WEB PAGE WILL BE AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC AND TALK TO US. THANK YOU AND GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS. MY NAME'S KATHLEEN SAUDI AND I'M THE SYSTEM Y. TITLE NINE COORDINATOR FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. AND BEFORE THAT I WAS THE TITLE NINE OFFICER UCLA. I SO APPRECIATED LISTENING TO MY CO PANELISTS BECAUSE SO MUCH OF WHAT SHE SAID. RESONATED I WAS GOING TO OPEN MY COMMENTS WITH. I THINK WHAT YOU REFER TO AS OTHER ACTIONS UP WHICH WHICH. WE AGREE OR NOT ENOUGH. TO MOVE CULTURAL CHANGE BUT ARE VERY IMPORTANT. PRECURSORS TO THAT KIND OF CULTURAL CHANGE AND I WANTED TO TALK IT THROUGH WITH YOU ON SOME OF THOSE STEPS THAT YOU SEE HAS TAKEN. ON AS AN EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION THAT SUBJECT I THAT RECEIVES FEDERAL FUNDS WE ARE OBLIGATED UNDER TITLE NINE. TO STOP SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND SEXUAL ASSAULTS HAVE TO PREVENT IT FROM HAPPENING AND HAPPENING AGAIN AND THEN TO FIX IT. DOTSON OBLIGATION THAT YOU SEE HAS TAKEN VERY SERIOUSLY AND. RECKONED WITH OVER THESE LAST SEVERAL YEARS LIKE MANY COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES HAVE. STARTING IN TWENTY FOURTEEN WE PUT TOGETHER A. SYSTEM WIDE TASK FORCE OF STUDENTS AND FACULTY AND STAFF AND WE STARTED SOLICITING INPUT FROM OUR COMMUNITY AS TO HOW WE COULD BETTER. PREVENTION RESPOND TO SEXUAL HARASSMENT QUITTING SEXUAL ASSAULT AND WHAT WE HEARD. FROM OUR PARTICULARLY OUR SURVIVOR COMMUNITY THOSE WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED SEXUAL HARASSMENT SEXUAL VIOLENCE. IS THAT. WE NEEDED TO HAVE A VERY STRONG POLICY AS A STARTER AND WE NEEDED A SINGLE. TRANSPARENT PROCESS FOR REPORTING AND INVESTIGATING REPORTS NOW AGAIN THIS IS NOT IN ITSELF GOING TO CHANGE THE CULTURE BUT IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT. FIRST STEP THE INSTITUTION NEEDS TO CLEARLY CONVEYANCE EXPECTATIONS AND ESTABLISH A FAIR AND TRANSPARENT PROCESS ON CONVEYING THAT WE WILL HOLD PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE IF THEY VIOLATE THOSE EXPECTATIONS. WE ALSO IN SHORT AND I AND I HEARD THE CHAIR REFERENCE THAT IS. THAT ARE COMPLAINANTS GET INFORMED ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS TO THEIR COMPLAINTS ABOUT WHAT IS FOUND AND WHAT WAS DONE ABOUT IT THAT SORT OF ACCOUNTABILITY. IS VERY IMPORTANT OUR POLICY ALSO HAS EXPLICIT PROTECTIONS OPERATE HALLIE ATION FOR THOSE WHO REPORT SEXUAL HARASSMENTAND ALSO FOR THOSE WHO HELP. INVESTIGATE OR REMEDY IT EITHER AS WITNESS SAYS OR SOMEONE WHO HELPS IMPLEMENT TO REMEDY WERE VERY COGNIZANT OF THE CONCERNS ABOUT RETALIATION PARTICULARLY IN CULTURES WHERE THERE ARE POWER DIFFERENTIALS SUCH AS. AT A UNIVERSITY. WERE CERTAINLY HERE AS WELL. I'M IT WAS ALSO IMPORTANT THAT OUT BY LAW EVERY YOU SEE LOCATION HAS HAVE A TITLE MIND OFFICER. ON THAT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT PERSON ON THE CAMPUS. BECAUSE THEY ARE THE SORT OF CENTRALIZED PLACE THAT TAKES ALL REPORTS AND DIRECTS THE RESPONSE AND. IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT HAVE THAT PERSON THERE INDEPENDENT ON THEIR CENTRALIZED WE'VE DONE A LOT OF WORK SORT OF PUBLICIZING I'M IN TRYING TO MAKE SURE OUR COMMUNITY KNOWS WHERE TO GO TO REPORT. AND THEN HAVING THAT SORT OF CENTRALIZED REPORTING DATABASE ENABLES THE TITLE MIND OFFICER TO IDENTIFY PATTERNS. IDENTIFY REPEAT OFFENDERS. TRYIN ASSESS WHETHER MORE SORT OF SYSTEMIC ACTIONS ARE REQUIRED SO THAT TITLE NINE OFFICERS BEEN REALLY IMPORTANT TO OUR RESPONSE. AS IMPORTANT AS THOSE SORT OF RESPONSIVE EFFORTS HAVE BEEN IN AND THOSE REPORTING PROCESS THESE. IT'S BEEN PERHAPS JUST AS IMPORTANT OR MORE IMPORTANT TO SET UP CONFIDENTIAL. RESOURCES ON PLACES WHERE SOMEONE WHO'S EXPERIENCING SEX HARASSMENT SEXUAL VIOLENCE CAN GO ON WITH OUT. PUTTING THEIR EMPLOYER ON NOTICE AND TRIGGERING A WHOLE PROCESS THAT THEY MIGHT NOT BE READY TO ENGAGE IN YET. SO AT THE CAMPUS IS WE HAVE A CONFIDENTIAL ADVOCATE. WHO SERVES STUDENTS AND EMPLOYEES TO EXPERIENCE SEXUAL VIOLENCE OR SEXUAL HARASSMENT BUT WE ALSO HAVE AN ARM BUDS OR EMPLOYEE COUNSELING CENTER AND HAVING THE ABILITY TO LEARN ABOUT WHAT THE COMPLETE PROCESS MIGHT LOOK LIKE? IN A CONFIDENTIAL SETTING IS VERY EMPOWERING FOR SOMEONE WHO. MAYBE EXPERIENCING SEX HARASSMENT GIVES THEM BACK SORT OF A SENSE OF CONTROL. IN A SPACE WHERE THEY'RE THEY'RE NOT FEELING THAT THEY'RE FEELING THE SITUATION'S VERY OUT OF CONTROL. SO HAVING THOSE CONFIDENTIAL RESOURCES ON HAS BEEN REALLY IMPORTANT FOR YOU SEE. AND THOSE ARE REALLY ABOUT. YOU KNOW HOW WE RESPOND AFTER SEXUAL HARASSMENT SEXUAL VIOLENCE HAS OCCURRED OF COURSE. IDEALLY WE WOULD BE PREVENTING AT AND AND AND NOT HAVING SEXUAL HARASSMENT SEXUAL. ASSAULT. OCCUR AND OUR LOCATIONS ON SO WE FOCUSED A LOT ON. PREVENTION AND AWARENESS AND. I DO THINK IT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT PIECE OF THE PUZZLE I THINK. FOR A LOT OF THE REASONS. THAT MY CO PANELISTS IDENTIFIED ITS. PROBABLY THE MOST CHALLENGING PIECE OF THE PUZZLE AS WELL. WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH OUR COMMUNITY TO TRY AND HEAR FROM THEM WHAT MESSAGES WOULD RESONATE WITH THEM IN TERMS OF. PREVENTION. FOR OUR STUDENTS WE'RE REQUIRED BY LAW. BUT IT'S ALSO A GOOD IDEA TO EDUCATE THEM ON BYSTANDER INTERVENTION AND YOU MENTIONED. BEING AN ACTIVE BYSTANDER AND I THINK. FOR ME WATCHING THIS ME TOO MOVEMENT UNFOLDS. SOME OF THE MORE RESIDENT. DISCLOSURES HAVE BEEN FROM THOSE BYSTANDERS THIS PEOPLE WHO'VE SAID. YOU KNOW I SAW THIS HAPPENING AND I. AND I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT I MAY NOT HAVE KNOWN. EXACTLY WHAT WAS HAPPENING BUT I KNEW SOMETHING I DIDN'T STEP IN AND I WISH I HAD. AND SO WE REALLY TRY TO SPEAK TO OUR STUDENTS. ABOUT THAT WE REALLY HAVE TRIED TO TRANSLATE THAT AND SPEAK TO OUR OUR EMPLOYEES ABOUT THAT AS WELL IN OUR FACULTY AND OUR STAFF. AND. IT'S IMPORTANT IT'S BEEN IMPORTANT FOR ME TO SORT OF. HI THIS ISSUE TO UC'S MISSION WHICH IS EDUCATION. AND RESEARCH ON AND THINKING ABOUT TITLE NINE AS A LAW ABOUT EQUAL ACCESS. TO EDUCATION AND AND UP OF SAFE AND FAIR WORKING ENVIRONMENT AND I THINK. FOR OUR FACULTY PARTICULARLY UP IF THEY THINK ABOUT IT IN TERMS OF. UNDERMINING THAT MISSION THAT SEXUAL HARASSMENT SEXUAL VIOLENCE UNDERMINES THAT EDUCATIONAL MISSION AND REALLY CAN DERAIL. STUDENT. FROM. PROGRESSING WITH THEIR ACADEMIC CAREER ON I THINK THEY START TO SEE OKAY THAT'S WHY I NEED TO STEP IN. ON THOUGHTS Y. NEED TO BE AN ACTIVE BYSTANDERS SO THAT'S THE MESSAGE THAT WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO SEND TOWARD COMMUNITY AND. I THINK THE MESSAGE REALLY DOES START AT THE TOP SO WE'VE BEEN FORTUNATE TO HAVE PRESIDENT APOLLO TANO REALLY. TAKE ON THIS ISSUE SPEAK VERY PUBLICLY ABOUT IT SHE'S NEVER. PRETENDED THAT WE HAVE IT FIGURED OUT SHE'S NEVER DENIED THAT IT'S. THAT IT'S. NOT BEEN A SERIOUS ISSUE BUT SHE'S VERY PUBLICLY COMMITTED TO TRYING TO FIT. AND. I THINK THAT THAT MESSAGE FROM LEADERSHIP HAS BEEN REALLY IMPORTANT. LISTENING TO UP MY CO PANELISTS TALK ABOUT CULTURE CHANGE. IT BROUGHT HOME TO ME AS WELL THAT I THINK SOMETHING ELSE. THAT HAS BEEN IMPORTANT IF. PAINFUL. HAS BEEN THE VERY PUBLIC AND ONGOING RECKONING THAT YOU SEE HAS HAD. I DO WITH THIS ISSUE SO I THINK I'M HAVING OUR ENTIRE COMMUNITY. NOT STRUGGLING WITH THIS HAS NOT BEEN AN OPTION FOR US. AND I THINK. AS AS AS ONE OF YOU SAID THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY. THIS IS A MOMENT THIS IS THIS IS THE TIME TO START THAT CONVERSATION AND IN SOME WAYS. YOU KNOW I I REMEMBER WHEN SECRETARY DEVICE SPOKE ABOUT. ROLLING BACK THE TOTAL I PROTECTIONS SHE KIND OF SAID I WISH WE DIDN'T HAVE TO TALK ABOUT THIS AT ALL. AND. THAT'S NOT THE ANSWER RIGHT. WEEK IF. WE DO HAVE TO TALK ABOUT IT AND WE DO HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE REALITY AND I'M AS PAINFUL AS IT IS. I THINK IT'S. I THINK IT'S PROGRESS SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU WE'RE GOING TO BE EXTREMELY TWENTY FIRST CENTURY AND BRING SOMEBODY AND THROUGH THE INTERNET. THE INTERNET'S A SO. SKYPE I KNOW THAT WAS A BRANDED COPYRIGHTED NAME I COULDN'T SAY. I MISGUIDED DEMAND. SO WE'RE GONNA GET THAT GOING AND AND. WHERE DOES THIS PANELIST WILL STAY WITH US AFTERWARDS AS WELL IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS HELLO WELCOME IF YOU WANT TO JUST BRIEFLY INTRODUCE YOURSELF AND THEN. JUST TELL US WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY AND THEN AFTERWARDS WE'RE GOING TO HAVE ANOTHER PANELIST SPEAK AND THEN HOLD IT OPEN FOR QUESTIONS. IF YOU CAN STAND BY AFTER. YOUR TESTIMONY. AT I THINK MEANS I CAN'T THINK VERY WELL I'M SO SORRY YES I AM SPEAKING TO YOU HAVE BETTER THINGS. OKAY HOT. THAT I THINK YOU THANK YOU. I AM I'M JOE WELL AMHERST AND I'M THE FOUNDER AND CEO OF PARADIGM WHERE ITS STRATEGY FIRM THAT WORKS WITH ORGANIZATIONS TO HELP THEM DESIGN. ONES EVER WERE INCLUDES SEVEN ULTIMATELY HEALTHIER CULTURES. SO I CAN GET A LITTLE BIT MORE ARE. BACKGROUND ON ON HOW WE THINK ABOUT THIS WORKING JUST A FEW KEY THINGS ARE GONNA BE PRETTY BRIEF RELATED TO YOU. ON THE CONVERSATIONS THAT I KNOW YOU'RE HAVING TODAY. FEEL FREE TO INTERRUPT ME IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS AND. DO BEFORE FOUNDING PARADIGM I WAS THAT WOMEN'S RIGHTS LAWYER ON AND MY WORK INCLUDED IT'S DOING COMPANIES FOR SEXUAL HARASSMENT. I THINK LITIGATION IS UNDOUBTEDLY A REALLY POWERFUL IN CRUCIAL TOOL FOR JUST S. BUT IN MY WORK I FOUND THAT BY THE TIME HARASSMENT CURZON'S CERTAINLY. I TIME ACCOMPANIED BEING SUED FOR IT ON A NUMBER OF THINGS HAVE BROKEN DOWN AN ORGANIZATIONAL LEVEL AND THAT'S WHAT LED ME TO FOUND PARADIGM AND IT'S A LITTLE BIT ABOUT. WHAT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT TODAY? THEY'RE IN OUR WORK WITH PARADIGM WE PARTNER WITH ORGANIZATIONS TO DESIGN STRONGER MORE INCLUSIVE CULTURES WHERE EMPLOYEES FROM ALL BACKGROUNDS CAN REALLY DRIVE. AND KNOWING THAT YOU CAN GO TO WORK EVERY DAY WITHOUT FEAR OF BEING HARASSED AS A CORE PART AND A HEALTHY INCLUSIVE CULTURE. SO IN OUR WORK REALLY THINK ABOUT HELPING ORGANIZATIONS DESIGN CULTURES WHERE HARASSMENT IS LESS LIKELY TO OCCUR. AND WHERE IT'S TAKEN SERIOUSLY AND ADDRESSED SWIFTLY WHEN IT DOES. SO I WANT TO TALK JUST BRIEFLY ABOUT HOW TO BUILD DIVERSE ORGANIZATIONS HOW TO HOLD PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE. AND JUST A COUPLE OF FACTORS TO CONSIDER WITH RESPECT TO TRAINING BECAUSE I KNOW THAT TRAINING OFTEN ONE THAT'S WILL. USE ANSWERED IN A PREVENTATIVE WAY FOR ORGANIZATIONS THINKING ABOUT SEXUAL HARASSMENT. SO AN ESSENTIAL PIECE OF ANY CONVERSATION ABOUT HARASSMENT IT REALLY DOES NEED TO BE DESIGNING ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE DIVERSE. WHERE WOMEN ARE BETTER REPRESENTED IN PARTICULARLY IRWIN ARE BETTER REPRESENTED IN CORE FUNCTIONS AND IN LEADERSHIP ROLES WE KNOW THAT SEXUAL HARASSMENT IS LESS LIKELY TO OCCUR? SO ONE QUESTION TO CONSIDER IN ORGANIZATIONS WHERE WOMEN ARE UNDER REPRESENTED. OR PARTICULARLY WHERE THERE ARE UNDERREPRESENTED IN POSITIONS OF POWER IS WHY IS THAT HAPPENING WATER THE FACTORS INFLUENCING REPRESENTATION. I MEAN ARE WORKING PARADIGM WE CONSIDER THIS BY LOOKING AT THE ENTIRE EMPLOYEE LIFE CYCLE WHICH WE BREAK DOWN INTO FOUR KEY PIECE AS WE CALL THEM ATTRACT THE LACK DEVELOPER TEAM. AND WE CONSIDER WHERE IN THAT LIFE CYCLE ARE WOMEN FACING UNIQUE BARRIERS. THE DATA IS REALLY KEY HERE. IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE TOP OF THE FINAL WHO IS ME YOU CAN'T BEING CONSIDERED FOR WHICH JOB OPPORTUNITIES. HOW HIRING DECISIONS ARE MADE? WHO IS DEVELOPING AN ADVANCING GETTING OPPORTUNITY? BECAUSE STAYING AND WHO'S LEAVING. IN TERMS OF MORE SUBJECTIVE OUTCOMES IT'S IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND HOW PEOPLE FEEL IN THEIR DAY TO DAY WORK. YOU PEOPLE FEEL SAFE. IN A FEEL EMPOWERED TO SPEAK UP THE PEOPLE FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE A VOICE. YOU PEOPLE FEEL LIKE THEY BELONG. ALL OF THESE DATA I AM OFFER A REALLY POWERFUL INSIGHT INTO WHERE ORGANIZATIONAL AND CULTURAL BARRIERS ARE MERGING. I PROACTIVELY ADDRESSING THESE TYPES OF BARRIERS ORGANIZATIONS CAN BUILD MORE DIVERSE INCLUSIVE CULTURE IS OUR CRAFTSMAN IS LESS LIKELY TO HAPPEN. IN ADDITION THE BUILDING HEALTHY CULTURES ORGANIZATION ALSO NEED TO PRIORITIZE ACCOUNTABILITY. I KNOW THERE'LL BE OTHER NO DISCUSSION ABOUT THAT ARE ALREADY HAD BEEN AND IT'S SOMETHING YOU'VE ALREADY THOUGHT ABOUT. BUT I THINK WHAT I WOULD JUST SAY HERE IS THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO THINK ABOUT GOING BEYOND THE BARE MINIMUM REQUIRED BY LOT. AND CONSIDER ESTABLISHING MORE PROGRESS THAT POLICY IS THAT OUTLINED A TAPE OF CULTURE YOU ACTUALLY WANT TO WORK IN. AND I KNOW THAT THE PUBLIC SECTOR IS DIFFERENT FROM PRIVATE CORPORATIONS AND HAS UNIQUE CHALLENGES AROUND. ON ABILITY. BUT ULTIMATELY IN LATIN ORGANIZATION CREATES A CULTURE IN WHICH HARASSMENT ISN'T TOLERATED. ARM NONE OF US SHOULD BE SURPRISED TO FIND THAT HARASSMENT CONTINUES IN THAT CULTURE. WELL THE LAST TACTICAL PIECE I WANT TO MENTION BRIEFLY AT THE IMPORTANCE OF THE PLAYING AWFUL WILL ANTI HARASSMENT TRAINING. ON ANTI HARASSMENT TRAINING IS REALLY COMIN AYE IF LEGALLY REQUIRED IN MANY TYPES OF ORGANIZATIONS ACTUALLY NATION WIDE A LOT OF STATES HAVE SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS. I AM BUT I THINK WE'LL BE OFTEN IN THIS TYPE OF TRAINING IS THAT IT'S NOT WELL DESIGNED TO ACHIEVE THE OUTCOMES WE ACTUALLY WANT. TRAINING AS OFTEN AND REALLY COMPLIANCE FOCUSED I FAILED TO PROVIDE BYSTANDERS WERE ALLIES WITH SKILLS FOR INTERVENING FOR SPEAKING OUT. IT TURNS OUT WE KNOW FROM RESEARCH THAT TRAINING IS ACTUALLY LESS LIKELY TO HAVE AN IMPACT ON PEOPLE WHO ARE MORE PRONE TOWARDS COMMITTING HARASSMENT. SO I THINK WE SOMETIMES THINK ABOUT TRAINING AS SOMETHING TO STOP HARASSERS. THAT'S NOT LIKELY TO WORK VERY WELL. WHICH TRAINING CAN HAVE AN IMPACT ON EVERYBODY ELSE. BUT IT MATTERS HOW TRAINING ITS FRAMES FOR EXAMPLE IT'S IMPORTANT THE HIGHLY ETHICAL NOT JUST LEGAL. ISSUES WITH SEXUAL HARASSMENT HELPER DOESN'T UNDERSTAND THE IMPACT OF HARASSMENT ON VICTIMS. TRAINING DELIVERY MATTER AS AS WELL FOR EXAMPLE WE KNOW THAT IN PERSON TRAINING IS MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE THAN ONLINE TRAINING WE ALSO KNOW THAT. TRAINING THAT'S TARGETED TOWARDS ON JUST MEN AT WHAT THE FACT AND THEN TRAINING THAT BRINGS TOGETHER PEOPLE OF ALL GENDERS HAVE THIS CONVERSATION. AND FINALLY I THINK IT'S JUST CRITICAL TO MENTION FROM FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE THINKING ABOUT ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE IS. THAT HARASSMENT DOESN'T HAPPEN IN A VACUUM. SEXUAL HARASSMENT PRETTY GOOD DOESN'T HAPPEN IN A VACUUM CULTURES THAT ALLOW FOR HARASSMENT. ARE USUALLY PLAYING BY OTHER ISSUES AS WELL. DOING ORGANIZATION AND VERY WOMEN ARE DEVALUED I'M AND HARASSED WOMEN ARE ALSO LIKELY TO FAITH OTHER BARRIERS LIKE BIAS OR DISCRIMINATION IN HIRING OUTCOMES AND ACCESS TO. CLEAN YOUR HIGH VISIBILITY ASSIGNMENTS PROMOTION AND COMPENSATION. I IN ORGANIZATIONS THAT ALLOW FOR SEXUAL HER ASK MEANT. WE ALSO EXPECTED FIND OTHER FORMS OF HARASSMENT AND DISCRIMINATION FOR EXAMPLE DISCRIMINATION BASED ON RACE. NEWS ORGANIZATIONS THAT ALREADY TREATING PEOPLE DIFFERENTLY BASED ON THEIR IDENTITIES. I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO CONSIDER HERE THE UNIQUE EXPERIENCE FOR THE WOMEN OF COLOR AND THE INTERSECTION OF RACIAL AND SEXUAL HARASSMENT THAT WOMEN OF COLOR SO OFTEN EXPERIENCE. IN ORGANIZATIONS WHERE WE SEE SATCHEL HARASSMENT OR PARTICULARLY LIKELY IF HE PARTICULARLY EGREGIOUS HARASSMENT AGAINST WOMEN OF COLOR. SO AND I WANTED TO JUST GET SOME OF THOSE KEY INSIGHTS FROM OUR WORK WITH ORGANIZATIONS AND AND. YOU ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS I MIGHT BE ABLE TO PROVIDE INSIGHT BASED BASED ON THE WORK THAT WE DO YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND WILL COME BACK TO YOU FOR QUESTIONS A BEFORE WE DO THAT I'M GOING TO GO TO OUR LAST. PANELIST. ARAB BUT HURT. OF NOT IN THE ROOM I IN THE ROOM WON THIS BATTLE. I'VE THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME THE OPPORTUNITY MY NAME IS JOHNNY TAYLOR CHAIRMAN. CHAIRWOMAN FRIEDMAN CHAIRWOMAN MITCHELL AND DISTINGUISHED MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE. I AM THE PRESIDENT AND CEO OF AN ORGANIZATION CALLED THE SOCIETY FOR HUMAN. SURE. AND JUST BY WAY OF BACKGROUND HAVE AN INTERESTING EXPERIENCE OF SET OF EXPERIENCES FIRST AS A LABOR EMPLOYMENT LAWYER DEFENSE LAWYER. I THEN WENT ON TO RUN HR FOR A NUMBER OF FORTUNE FIVE HUNDRED COMPANIES WHICH HAD OPERATIONS HERE IN CALIFORNIA TICKETMASTER INS. LA AND ASK DOT COM AT OAKLAND SO WE WE HAD BUSINESSES ALL OVER THE WORLD. AND. AND THERE WAS PORTION OF THE OP HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SERVICE CEO OF ONE OF THOSE BUSINESS SO THAT WAS MY PRIVATE SECTOR SIDE. OF THE LAST SEVEN AND A HALF YEARS I WAS THE A CEO BUT THURGOOD MARSHALL COLLEGE FUND. WHICH IS ORGANIZATION SERVICE HISTORICALLY BLACK COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES. AND THEN LITERALLY AND THREE WEEKS ON THE JOB HERE AS THE CEO OF THE SOCIETY FOR HUMAN RESOURCE. MET SO A VERY INTERESTING SET OF EXPERIENCES WHICH WILL INFORM. MY COMMENTS OF FOR THE NEXT TEN OR SO MINUTES BUT THANK YOU. I THE PURITY IT TODAY ON BEHALF OF SHARM WITH THE WORLD'S LARGEST HR PROFESSIONAL SOCIETY WE HAVE OVER TWO HUNDRED NINETY THOUSAND MEMBERS AND A HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE COUNTRIES. WE'VE TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND MEMBERS RIGHT HERE IN THIS GREAT STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THE KEY THOUGH IS OUR MEMBERS ACTUALLY IN TURN AFFECTED IMPACT THE LIVES OF OVER ONE HUNDRED MILLION WORKERS. THAT'S THE REAL DEAL SO THE THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND MEMBERS IS NICE BUT IF YOU THINK ABOUT EVERYDAY I ABILITY TO INFLUENCE THE LIVES OF A HUNDRED MILLION PEOPLE NEARLY A THIRD OF OUR. US POPULATION. THAT'S THE THE WORK THAT WE DO AT THE SOCIETY FOR HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT FOR NEARLY SEVENTY YEARS. SHARMA'S BEEN THE LEADING ORGANIZATION IN PEOPLE MANAGEMENT AND WE HELP ORGANIZATIONS LEARN HOW TO MANAGE THEIR PEOPLE BETTER THEIR HUMAN ASSETS. INCLUDING CREATING WORKPLACES THAT FOSTER A CULTURE OF RESPECT. WE'RE COMMITTED TO ELIMINATING ALL FORMS OF HARASSMENT I THINK IS REALLY KEY THAT WHILE TODAY I APPRECIATE THEIR FOCUS ON SEXUAL HARASSMENT. THERE ARE ALL SORTS OF FORMS OF WORKPLACE HARASSMENT THAT OUR ORGANIZATION FOCUSES ON AND SEXUAL HARASSMENT IS OBVIOUSLY THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUE OF THE DAY. RIGHT NOW BUT WE EDUCATE OUR MEMBERS NOT ONLY ON THAT AND COMPLYING WITH THE LAW BUT AND BUILDING A POSITIVE AND PRODUCTIVE WORKPLACE CULTURE. WE BELIEVE THAT CREATING AND MAINTAINING HARASSMENT FREE WORKPLACE IS NOT JUST A LEGAL PRIORITY. BUT A BUSINESS ONE. I'M PLEASE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TODAY TO DISCUSS HOW THESE CONCEPTS APPLY TO HIGH PROFILE AND DYNAMIC WORKPLACES SUCH AS THE CALIFORNIA STATE AND ASSEMBLY. PUBLIC CALIFORNIA STATE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY. A MOST IMPORTANTLY I'M GOING TO ADDRESS THE ROLE OF WORKPLACE CULTURE IN PREVENTING AND ADDRESSING SEXUAL HARASSMENT IN ALL WORKPLACES. SO HERE'S THE IRONY. EXACTLY TWENTY YEARS AGO THIS WEEK. WE WATCHED THIS COUNTRY DIVIDE ITSELF OVER AN ETHICAL CRISIS INVOLVING A U. S. PRESIDENT AND AN INTERN. FAST FORWARD TO TODAY. AND WE FIND OURSELVES STILL STRUGGLING. SAME ISSUES AROUND SIX. POWER AND CONSENT. ALL OF WHICH INTERSECT IN THE WORKPLACE. LET'S ALSO REMEMBER THAT EVEN AFTER MP AND AND THIS IS NOT A POLITICAL STATEMENT. THAT SAME PRESIDENT VENICE HIS FINAL TERM WITH THE HIGHEST IN THE OFFICE APPROVAL. OF ANY PRESIDENT SINCE WORLD WAR TWO. AND HE CONTINUES TO RANK IN THE MOST POPULAR AMERICANS IN THAT ON THE GLOBE. CLEARLY AS MUCH AS WE TALK ABOUT THIS TODAY WE HAVE TO SPEAK ABOUT THE BROADER CONCEPT OF THE AMERICAN CULTURE. OKAY THAT'S I MEAN WE HAVE TO PUT THAT IN THE CONTEXT THE IDEA THAT SOMEHOW. THIS ORGANIZATION THE STATE CAN OPERATE IN THE VACUUM IN THIS UNITED STATES AND NOT APPRECIATE WHAT WE ACCEPT US TOLERATE BEHAVIOR THAT'S ACCEPTABLE IN BABY THAT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE WE GOTTA START LOOKING AT THE MAN AND THE WOMEN IN THE MIRROR AND ASKING OURSELVES HOW DO WE REALLY FEEL ABOUT. THIS. FAIR. LIKE HOLLYWOOD AND WALL STREET THE LEGISLATIVE ENVIRONMENT IS UNIQUELY SUSCEPTIBLE TO SEXUAL HARASSMENT SITUATION. WHAT THEY ALL HAVE IN COMMON THOUGH IS THAT THESE WERE PLACES ARE DRIVEN BY COMPLEX POWER DYNAMIC? A FEW PEOPLE HOLD THE CAREERS AND FUTURES OF MANY OTHERS IN THEIR HANDS. AND SOME OF THOSE PEOPLE ARE DEEMED FRANKLY TOO BIG TO FAIL. THEY'RE TOO IMPORTANT TO PALE AND WE HAVE TO BE HONEST ABOUT THAT. ALSO THE USE THESE WERE. TEND TO BE MALE DOMINATED. AND I WANNA BE CLEAR THAT WHILE SIX HARASSMENT IS ISRAEL IT'S NOT JUST A WOMAN'S ISSUE ALONE. NOT BY A LONG SHOT MEN ARE ALSO PICKED. AND WOMEN ARE ALSO PERPETRATORS. SEXUAL HARASSMENT IS ABOUT POWER. AND AND IT'S ABOUT IT'S COMMITTEE IT'S IT'S ABOUT WHO'S COMMITTED TO DOING THAT WHOEVER IS IN CONTROL. IT JUST SO HAPPENS FRANKLY THAT IN MANY OF THESE WORKPLACES MEN ARE IN CONTROL AT LEAST FOR NOW. ANOTHER COMMONALITY AMONG SOARED HIGH POWER WORKPLACES IS THAT YOU HAVE A WEALTH OF YOUNGER. SPIRALING COMPETITIVE EMPLOYEES. WHO WERE ENTHRALLED BY POWERFUL OFTEN OLDER PEOPLE? THIS CULTURE CREATES PERFECT CONDITIONS FOR SEXUAL HARASSMENT. IT'S ALSO ONE THAT IS RIGHT FOR POSITIVE TRANSFORMATION. AND IT'S TIME FOR A CULTURAL TRANSFORMATION IN YOUR LEGISLATIVE WORKPLACES. AND AS A LEADER IN WORKPLACE CHANGE CALIFORNIA MUST STARTED IN NAME A START IT RIGHT HERE RIGHT NOW SO I I. PRAISE YOU AYE LOGIC FOR DOING THIS WORK. SOMETHING THAT ONE OF MY CO PANELISTS IS MENTIONED CULTURE ALWAYS TRUMP'S COMPLIANT. PERIOD. CHARMS PERSPECTIVE IS UNIQUE BECAUSE WE REPRESENT NOT JUST ONE SEGMENT OF THE EMPLOYMENT SECTOR. BUT A PROFESSION THAT SPANS ALL INDUSTRY INCLUDING COMPANIES FOR PROFIT NONPROFIT A GOVERNMENT AND WORK HARD WORK FORCES THAT A LARGE AND SMALL. I MEMBERS HAVE SEEN IT ALL AND THEY LET US KNOW WHAT WORKS AND WHAT DOESN'T. HERE'S WHAT DOESN'T WORK. RELYING ON COMPLIANCE. RULES EDUCATION AND TRAINING TO PREVENT OR ADDRESS SEXUAL HARASSMENT. IT'S TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN SELECT TASK FORCE REPORT ON HARASSMENT THE EOC RECOGNIZE THAT EVEN EFFECTIVE TRAINING CANNOT OCCUR IN A VACUUM. IT MUST BE PART OF A HOLISTIC CULTURE OF NON HARASSMENT THAT STARTS AT THE TOP. COMPLIANCE IS A KEY COMPONENT OF HER HER OF A HARASSMENT FREE WORKPLACE BUT IN REALITY WE COULD DEMAND THAT EVERY EMPLOYEE EACH OF THE IN YOUR OFFICES COULD DEMAND THAT EVERY EMPLOYEE TAKE TEN HOURS OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT TRAINING EVERY WEEK. AND IT'S STILL GOING TO HAPPEN. BY THE SAME TOKEN WE CAN ENFORCE THE SPEED THIS POLICIES FOR BEATING WORKPLACE RELATIONSHIPS. AS THE EASY ANSWER. BUT OFFICE ROMANCE IS GOING TO HAPPEN. YOU SIMPLY CAN'T IGNORE OR LEGISLATE HUMAN EXPERIENCE AND HUMAN BEHAVIOR SO IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO DEAL IN REALITY. WE HAVE ALSO SEEN CASE AFTER CASE WERE PROBLEMATIC BEHAVIORS AND SITUATIONS NEVER RISE TO THE LEGAL DEBATE DEFINITION OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT. BUT ARE PROBLEMATIC NONE THE LESS PROFESSOR KIM COB GEORGE INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY PUT IT BEST WHEN SHE SAYS THERE'S A BIG GRAY ZONE. BETWEEN LEGAL SEXUAL HARASSMENT ANY CULTURE OF INCLUSION. AND SHE SAID IN BACK GRADIENT REAL DAMAGE IS BEING DONE ON A DAILY BASIS THAT'S CHANGING PEOPLE'S LIVES AND CHANGING THE TRAJECTORY OF THEIR CAREERS. THAT'S REAL. THIS IS WHY I URGE YOU NOT TO BE IN THE WORD BY THE COTTAGE INDUSTRY. SPRINGING UP ALL AROUND SEXUAL HARASSMENT COMPLIANCE PROGRAMS THEY WANT TO COME AND CONSIDER THE FACT THAT NINETY EIGHT PERCENT OF US WORKPLACES HAVE SEXUAL HARASSMENT POLICIES. AND THE VAST MAJORITY OF THEM TOO A LOT OF EXPENSIVE TRAINING. AND YET HERE WE ARE. LET ME BE CLEAR. RULES EDUCATION TRAINING ARE NECESSARY IN FACT SHARMA'S WORKING WITH THE NATIONAL CONFERENCE OF STATE LEGISLATURES NCSL YOU HEAR FROM THEM LATER TODAY TO CO HOST A FREE. TRAINING FOR NCSL MEMBERS ON HARASSMENT AND ESTABLISHING A CULTURE OF RESPECT IN THEIR LEGISLATIVE OFFICES LAST WEEK WE CONDUCTED A SIMILAR WEAPON I WITH EEOC ACTING CHAIR VICKI LIPNIK. CHARM ALSO PROVIDES NUMEROUS PROGRAMS AT CONFERENCES THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY ON CREATING AND MAINTAINING HARASSMENT FREE WORKPLACE INCLUDING IN CALIFORNIA THROUGH OUR STATE COUNCIL. CAL SHERM AND ARE SEVENTEEN CHAPTERS. BUT RULES EDUCATION TRAINING FRANKLY WILL NEVER BE ENOUGH EVEN ZERO TOLERANCE POLICIES HAVE NO AFFECT WHEN PEOPLE DON'T FEEL SAFE TO REPORT HARASSMENT. WHEN THERE'S NO MECHANISM TO TO REPORT TO REPORT THE PEOPLE. WHO WHO ENGAGE IN THIS BEHAVIOR? WE DON'T SEE SUCCESS AND MISS HERE. THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE TO MARGINALIZE DISTRUST BULLIED AND EVEN FORCED OUT TO HELP US CULTURE MAKE REAL CULTURAL CHANGE. MANUALS AND TRAINING SO USELESS AND WORK PLACES WHERE BAD BEHAVIOR IS SILENTLY TOLERATED. IT IS CULTURE NOT COMPLIANCE THAT GUIDES WORKPLACE CONDUCT. AGAIN. LET'S BRING THIS DISCUSSION HERE TO THIS STATE AND LEGISLATIVE BODY. BUT THE STATE SENATE AND THE ASSEMBLY HERE HAVE AN ETHICS COMMITTEE UNDERSTAND AND STANDARDS FOR REPORTING SEXUAL HARASSMENT. HOWEVER THE STANDARDS ARE NOT ALIVE. INSIDE OF USED TO IT ONE WAY OUT OF THE SIDES TO ANOTHER WAY. AND CLEARLY IT'S NOT WORKING. EMPLOYERS THINK UNLOADS HER EMPLOYERS IN CALIFORNIA WITH MORE THAN FIFTY EMPLOYEES MUST FOR ABOUT TWO HOURS ANTI SEXUAL HARASSMENT TRAINING EVERY TWO YEARS TO SUPERVISOR EMPLOYEES I MUST DISTRIBUTE INFORMATION TO ALL EMPLOYEES. NEW SUPERVISORS MUST ENGAGE IN TRAINING WITHIN SIX MONTHS OF TAKING THEIR POSITION. YET ACCORDING TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING YOU'LL HAVE FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY FOUR SEXUAL HARASSMENT CLAIMS FOUND IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN. IN ANY CASE NONE OF THIS WOULD HAVE MATTERED IF THE CULTURE HAD BEEN THE RIGHT ONE. SITUATIONS COULD HAVE BEEN AVERTED OR RESOLVED LONG BEFORE GETTING TO LEVEL OF COMMITTEES AND CLAIMS BEING FILED AND PEOPLE LOSING THEIR JOBS. THE ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE WE LIKE TO THINK OF THIS LIKE THE HUMAN BODY WHEN IT WORKS PROPERLY. VIRUSES AND TOXINS ARE NATURALLY EX. RIGHT IN A HEALTHY WORKPLACE. AND UP WITH A HEALTHY WORKPLACE CULTURE WHEN SEXUAL HARASSMENT IS OBSERVED OR EXPERIENCE THE COMMUNITY TAKES OVER. AND SHUTS IT DOWN COLLECTIVELY AS YOU. WITH THE MESSAGE THAT THIS BEHAVIOR WILL NOT BE TOLERATED HE. BY ANYONE AT ANY LEVEL. IDEALLY SEXUAL HARASSMENT DOESN'T OCCUR AT ALL BECAUSE THE BODY SIMPLY INOCULATE SELF. WITH HEALTHY NORMS EXPECTATIONS AND STANDARDS. THAT'S REALLY THE TASK FOR YOU WE CAN GO AND ENGAGE IN ALL SORTS OF SEX HARASSMENT TRAINING MANDATORY TRAINING MICHAEL PANELIST JUST SUGGESTED BRINGING IN PEOPLE WHO ARE INCLINED TO ENGAGE IN THIS BEHAVIOR TRAINING THEM DOESN'T SOLVE ANYTHING. WE'VE GOT TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO CHANGE THE CULTURE. AND IN A VERY PRACTICAL WAY. ONE WAY TO GET A HEALTHY CULTURE. THAT WILL NOT TOLERATE SEX HARASSMENT IS BY CHOOSING TO BE PRACTICAL ABOUT PEOPLE AND I'M GONNA FINISH ON THIS REALLY IMPORTANT WE ASK YOU. WHAT IS YOUR POLICY A WORKPLACE RELATIONSHIP? HERE THE CAPITAL YOU EMPLOY A LOT OF YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE MENTIONED THAT BEFORE MANY OF THEM SINGLE MOST OF THEM QUITE AMBITIOUS. THEY WILL PROCEED PURSUE EACH OTHER WITH THEIR MENTORS AND THEIR ROLE MODELS. THAT'S JUST HUMAN NATURE. AND RELATIONS. BUT THEM OUT LOS JUST GO UNDERGROUND. CONTRIBUTING TO A CULTURE OF DISHONESTY AND SECRECY SO THE VERY THING THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO SOLVE FOR IN THE WAY SHE CREATING. AND IF THEY ARE DISCOVERED YOU ARE NOW FACED WITH THE CHOICE OF FIRING ONE OR THE OTHER OR BOTH AND ORGANIZATION LUCIS TALENT CRITICAL TALENT. INSTEAD YOU COULD FOLLOW A POLICY OF DISCLOSURE. NOT UNLIKE WHAT WE DO WITH CONFLICTS OF INTEREST POLICIES ONE A REAL ACTUAL EXAMPLE OF WHAT COMPANIES ARE DOING IN ORGANIZATIONS ARE DOING. THEY'RE SAYING IF YOU REALLY WANT TO GET TO TRANSPARENCY IN THE TRUEST SENSE ALLOW PEOPLE TO COME FORWARD WITHOUT FEAR OF REPRISALS. BOTH OF THEM AND GIVE THEM A NOTHER PATHWAY. CONTINUE THEIR WORK RELATIONSHIP AND THEIR PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP. AND SO WE HAVE TO GET REALLY PRACTICAL ABOUT THIS. TWO OTHER ELEMENTS IN ESTABLISHING HEALTHY CUT TO IN A CAR HEALTHY CULTURE ARE SWIFT ACTION AND TRANSPARENCY. CLAIMS OF HARASSMENT OBVIOUSLY SHOULD BE INVESTIGATED IMMEDIATELY QUICKLY. AND IDEALLY BY AN INDEPENDENT PANEL. AND IF BEHAVIOR IS FOUND TO VIOLATE THE CULTURE OF THE ORGANIZATION THAT INDIVIDUAL SHE BE OBJECTED TO PROGRESSIVE DISCIPLINARY PROCEDURES UP TO AND INCLUDING BARRY. BUT THIS BRINGS US TO A CRITICAL POINT. IN THE ZEAL. TO ROUTE OUT SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND OTHER FORMS OF HARASSMENT ORGANIZATIONS MOVE MUST BE CAREFUL NOT TO SWING TOO FAR IN THE OTHER DIRECTION. CREATING A GUILTY UNTIL PROVEN INNOCENT STANDARD. I KNOW THAT'S NOT PARTICULARLY POPULAR BUT THAT'S THAT'S THE REALITY WE ALL HAVE MADE IN OUR LIVES WHO. COULD BE REALLY IMPACTED BY THIS AS WELL. BIDDY SEXUAL HARASSMENT ALLEGATIONS ARE FOUND TO BE UNSUBSTANTIATED. MANY ARE FOUND BE UNSUBSTANTIATED EEL CELLS EEOC TELLS US THAT AND IN SOME CASES THEY'RE OUT RIGHT ON TROOPS WOULD NOT THE LEGAL STANDARD PRODIGIOUS OUTRIGHT UNTRUE. A TRUST WORTHY DUE PROCESS SHOULD TECH BE ACCUSED UNTIL HERE SHE IS POUND EITHER RESPONSIBLE OR INNOCENT OF THE WRONGDOING. I RECOMMEND THAT YOU TAKE EVERY ALLEGATION SERIOUSLY OF COURSE. INVESTIGATE IT PROPERLY AND ADJUDICATED FAIRLY QUICKLY AND APPROPRIATELY BUT YOU HAVE TO HAVE A WORKPLACE WHERE EVERYONE FEELS SAFE. AND THIS CAN'T GO ONE WAY. CHEN HAS DEVELOPED MANY MANY BEST PRACTICES AND PROCEDURES FOR SUSTAINING A HEALTHY WORKPLACE AND I ENCOURAGE YOU TO LOOK AT OUR MEMBER TOOL KIT BECAUSE WE HAVE REAL LIFE EXAMPLES FROM WHERE REAL LIFE EMPLOYEES. WHO CAN TELL YOU HOW TO HELP GET THIS RIGHT? THIS TAKES COURAGE. BUT IS NOT A CHOICE ANYMORE. HOW DO YOU KNOW YOUR CULTURE IS WORKING WHEN IT MOSTLY RUNS ON ITSELF? HEALTHY CARD HEALTHY CULTURES SELF POLICE BAD BEHAVIORS THAT SAID THE SELF SELECT GOOD PEOPLE BE SELF REGULATE AFFECTED POLICIES AND SELF PERPETUATE. THAT'S WHEN YOU KNOW YOU HAVE A GOOD CULTURE. IN THE END A HEALTHY CULTURE IS A COMPETITIVE GAME CHANGER ALLOWING YOU TO GET AND KEEP THE BEST PEOPLE TO MEET YOUR MISSION. SEXUAL HARASSMENT IN THE WORKPLACE WREAKS HAVOC ON THE PAD BACK ON YOUR ABILITY. TO DO YOUR JOBS AS LEGISLATORS. EVEN IF THE SITUATION NEVER REACHES THE LEVEL OF A COMPLAINT. BUT IT PUSHES GOOD PEOPLE OUT OF THE ORGANIZATION YOU'VE LOST THE TALENT GAY. WITH CALIFORNIA'S UNEMPLOYMENT RATE DOWN FOUR POINT NINE PERCENT AND FOLLOWING THIS IS A RISK YOU SIMPLY CAN'T AFFORD WE CAN'T LOSE STRONG PEOPLE. THIS BODY NOW HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO TRANSFORM ITS CULTURE. AND AS THE BELLWETHER STATE FOR THE ENTIRE COUNTRY. YOU HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO DO THIS WORK. AS YOU GO ABOUT THIS CRITICAL WORK THOUGH I URGE YOU TO REMEMBER THAT COMPLIANCE MATTERS. BUT IT IS HEALTHY CULTURE STAVES OFF SEXUAL HARASSMENT. CULTURE CHANGES THE MOST IMPORTANT THING YOU CAN DO THAT ALL OF US CAN DO. TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL PEOPLE IN THE WORKPLACE ARE RESPECTED VALUED AND EMPOWERED TO SIX SHARM CAL SHARM AND OUR MEMBERS STAND WITH YOU EACH OF YOU. AND PUTTING AN END TO SEXUAL HARASSMENT AT WORK AND IN BUILDING BETTER WORKPLACES. FOR PEOPLE TO WORK AND CREATE ULTIMATELY A BETTER WORLD. SHARMA'S PLANS TO DO THIS WORK WITH THIS COMMITTEE AS IT ADDRESSES THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE BUT I JUST WANT TO COMMENT SENATOR MORE LACKS. A COMMENT IN RESPONSE THAT. BUT THIS IS A VERY VERY COMPLICATED ISSUE. IT'S COMPLEX. WHY IN THE IF YOU IF WE RUSH TO A DECISION WE WILL HAVE SOME REALLY POOR AND AND SUMS VERY NEGATIVE UNINTENDED? I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU AND I THANK BOTH OF THE CO CHAIRS FOR BEING THOUGHTFUL TAKING YOUR TIME AND DOING THIS RIGHT THE WORST THING YOU CAN DO IS ROLL OUT SOMETHING BECAUSE IT'S THE TOPIC OF THE DAY IN A TALL OF THE NEWS. AND RESPOND WITH EIGHT EIGHT EIGHT. EIGHT PROCESS OR A PROCEDURE WAY GIVEN A RESPONSE THAT IS NOT WELL THOUGHT OUT. YOU CAN REALLY DO DAMAGE TO THE ORGANIZATION AND CREATE THE CULTURE THAT YOU DON'T WANT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. IT WE'RE GONNA MOVE TO QUESTIONS NOW. I'M GONNA TAKE THE PROG HAVE TO ASK THE FIRST QUESTION I WAS VERY INTERESTED IN YOUR TESTIMONY MISTER TAYLOR THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I DO HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT THE ROLE OF HR PERSON NOW. BECAUSE. WE'VE SEEN YOU KNOW IN A LOT OF THESE CORPORATIONS WHETHER IT'S YOU KNOW IN HOLLYWOOD. YOU KNOW WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO SAY THE SAME THING ABOUT OUR ORGANIZATION. THERE WERE PEOPLE WITHIN ORGANIZATIONS THAT KNEW. THE RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS I MAY NOT HAVE BEEN IN POWER TO MAKE DECISIONS BASED ON THAT BUT WHAT IS GIVEN THAT WHAT IS THE ROLE OF HR PEOPLE ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY FEEL THAT THERE'S SOMETHING REALLY WRONG GOING ON WITH THE C. E. O.. A MEMBER OF THE LEGISLATURE I'M YOU KNOW GIVEN THAT THEIR EMPLOYEES WHAT SHOULD THEIR RULE BE. WE ARE THE UNITS INTERESTING WE'VE HAD THIS CONVERSATION ABOUT MEMBERS AND IT'S ABOUT COURAGEOUS HR. THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING THE COURAGE TO DO THAT MAKE THOSE TOUGH BECAUSE THEY NEED TO BE MADE AND WHAT WE HAVE REMINDED ALL OF OUR MEMBERS IS YOU ULTIMATELY WORK FOR THE ORGANIZATION. YOU DON'T WORK FOR C. E. O. CEOS COMING UP LEGISLATORS COME AND GO ULTIMATELY YOU WORK FOR THE ORGANIZATION THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN THIS AND. AND YOUR JOB AND YOUR DUTY OF LOYALTY IS TO THE ORGANIZATION AND SO WHEN YOU SEE SOMETHING THAT IS AN APPROPRIATE YOU HAVE AN OBLIGATION. THIS ISN'T IT NICE TO DO THIS IS WHAT YOU MUST DO AND WHAT WE GOTTA DO IS ENCOURAGE ARE MEMBERS TO HAVE THE COURAGE TO LITERALLY STEPPED UP AND CALL THESE THINGS WHAT THEY ARE. AND I WILL ADMIT IS THE PERSON WHO REPRESENTS THIS ORGANIZATION SOME THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND MEMBERS THAT IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US AS A PROFESSION. I UNDERSTAND THERE CONSEQUENCES AND ANYTIME YOU YOU TAKE ON THIS THESE POSITIONS THERE'D NOT WITHOUT PERSONAL CONSEQUENCE TO YOU BUT IF YOU SIT IN THAT SEAT AND YOU DECIDE THAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE AN HR PROFESSIONAL. IT IS INCUMBENT UPON YOU AND THAT'S OUR MESSAGE WE'RE GOING BACK TO OUR MEMBERS THINK I GET IT IT'S DIFFICULT YOU GOTTA MAKE SOME CHOICES. BUT THE REAL TEST IS CAN YOU WAKE UP EVERY DAY IN THE CAN THE MIRROR AND SAY. I DID MY JOB AND I FEEL GOOD THIS ORGANIZATION AND THIS WORLD IS IMPACT IS A BETTER PLACE. HR CAN BE A SOCIAL FORCE FOR GOOD. AND SO THIS IS ALL ABOUT COURAGE AND I KNOW THAT'S NOT A PARTICULARLY PRACTICAL ANSWER FOR YOU PRACTICALLY ARE SHARED WITH SOMEONE THE OTHER DAY I WAS. TALKING TO A YOUNG LADY IN A. CONFERENCE AND SHE SAID AND IT'S EASY FOR YOU TO TALK ABOUT COURAGE MUST STATE WHAT YOU KNOW SHE TALKED ABOUT HER BOSS WHO WAS A SERIAL SEXUAL HARASSER. ISSUES THAT BUT YOU KNOW I I'M A SINGLE MOM I GOT A CARD NOTE OF MORTGAGE I HAVE DECISIONS TO MAKE CONSCIOUS IT'S EASY IF YOU TALK ABOUT COURAGE AND. I WAS STUNNED BECAUSE LIKE WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED TO SAY THAT'S A PRACTICAL DILEMMA THAT YOU FACE. AND ANOTHER WOMAN IN THE ROOM STOOD UP AND SAID AND SHE WAS BEING CUTE ABOUT IT BUT I THINK IT WAS WHERE IT WAS WORTH PUBLISHES THAT DONE. HER SOUTHERN TWANG SHE'S MA'AM UP TO A WHICH DO. SAVE UP SIX TO EIGHT MONTHS USE ALLEN CREATE A GOLD HAIL FOR. LESS THAN A WHAT AGO TO HELP MONDAY SHE'S THAT THAT POINT WHERE YOU HAVE TO SHOW UP TO WORK EVERYDAY AND DO SOMETHING YOU DON'T BELIEVE VAN AND WORK AND REPRESENT THE INTEREST OF SOMEONE WHO IS A BAD PERSON. YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO STEP AWAY AND OR A VERY PRACTICAL LEVEL SHE WAS ENCOURAGING HER COLLEAGUES. TO PUT ASIDE SOME MONEY BE ABLE TO WALK AWAY FROM A VERY BAD ENVIRONMENT AND WE HAVE TO SET THAT EXAMPLE AS AN HR PROFESSION. JUST A FOLLOW UP TO HER DO YOU SUGGEST THAT ARE THERE ARE THERE ON THE. BUT DO YOU HAVE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR WAYS THAT. COMPANIES ARE AGENCIES CAN PROTECT THEIR HR PEOPLE. OUR SILO THEM SOMEHOW EMPOWER THEM AND GIVE THEM CHEN ALSO SPEAK UP IF THEY FEEL THAT THEY'RE BEING COULD THAT THAT THEIR RECOMMENDATIONS ARE. NOT BEING TAKEN SERIOUSLY WITHOUT THERE BEING SILENCED. YES SO SO WE ARE CURRENTLY WORKING ON A WHITE PAPER OUR KNOWLEDGE DEVELOPED PART DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT HIS IT WANTS TO WORK ON THAT AND AND WHO YOU KNOW BECAUSE WE IT WE ARE A PROFESSION. AND SO AS I'VE DESCRIBED TO TO FOLKS BEFORE IN MY LAWYER DAYS I WORKED TECHNICALLY FOR C. E. O. OR IF I WERE A LAWYER ON THE STAFF OF ONE OF YOUR STAFF I WORK FOR YOU. BUT THAT DOES NOT RELIEVE ME OF MY RESPONSIBILITY MY PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITY TO DO RIGHT. EVEN IF IT COMES AT THE RISK OF ME LOSING MY JOB THERE'S AN ETHICAL OBLIGATION AND SO WE ARE GOING TO SPEAK TO AND ARE WORKING ON A STANDARD THAT SAYS I'D LOVE TO CREATE A DIFFERENT PLACE FOR HR PEOPLE TO GO IN. WITH GOING TO BE PROTECTED AND ALL OF THAT BUT THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS WE'RE NOT SURE HOW PRACTICAL THAT IS IT MIGHT BE SOMETHING YOU COULD DO IN THE STATE CONTEXT YOU CAN SET UP YET ANOTHER OFFICE. FOR SOME FOR THE HR PEOPLE TO GO TO AFTER THEY ARE DEALING WITH ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN DEALT WITH BY NUMBER AGGRIEVED EMPLOYEE. BUT WE YEAR AT WITH THINKING THAT WE'RE THAT CAN HAPPEN YES THERE ARE SOME BEST PRACTICES AROUND ORGANIZATIONS SETTING UP UP PLACES SAFE PLACES FOR HR PEOPLE TO GO THE OTHER DISCUSSION NOW IS FOR US TO AGAIN. COMMIT TO A PROFESSIONAL. AT THE GOAL OBLIGATION TO REPORT NO MATTER WHAT. THANK YOU MISTER DALY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND. THINKS CULTURE LIKE DIDN'T SPOKE SPEAK ENOUGH. WHEN WE DID OUR DOCTORS BUT I'M HAPPY ON THIS COMMITTEE SO I. WHEN I SPEAK AS SOMEBODY WHO'S BEEN ELECTED FOR TWENTY TWO YEARS AND HAVE WENT THROUGH MORE SEXUAL HARASSMENT TRAININGS THAT I CARE TO TALK ABOUT. THE BUT I WANT TO SAY IN THAT WE'VE HEARD FROM ALL THREE ALL FOUR SPEAKERS TODAY ABOUT CULTURE. AND WHEN YOU HAVE AN ENVIRONMENT. WHERE? THE CULTURE HAS BEEN VERY POWERFUL THE PEOPLEWHO ARE AND HOW THE ABILITY TO USE THAT POWER. AND THEN ARE GUARDED BY THERE IS NO PLACE PLACE PLACE FOR THE VICTIM TO GO. THERE HASN'T BEEN IN THE PAST AND UNTIL WE SAW THE NEED TO DO TO WE SAW COURAGE BY. SOME VERY POWERFUL WOMEN IN IN IN FILM COME OUT AND AND STAND UP FOR WHAT. WAS WRONG WE SAW THEN. THIS CULTURE'S CHANGING NOW SO NOW WE ACTUALLY HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE OR WHO FEEL. EMPOWERED WHICH IS GREAT TO THE ARM. TALK ABOUT THE PERPETRATORS THAT HAVE HAVE HAVE DONE WRONG. SO WE HAVE A CULTURE HERE THAT IS A THAT THE PERPETRATORS HAVE NOT BEEN HELD ACCOUNTABLE. AND THE VICTIMS HAVE BEEN SHOPPED AROUND OR IN SOME CASES. NOT KNOW DUE DUE PROCESS SO WE'RE GONNA KILL YOU DID THIS COMMITTEE'S JOB. IS TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CHANGE THAT CULTURE THAT YOU'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT SO I WOULD BE INTERESTED IN KNOWING. WORD TO WE WERE TO WE START AND HOW DO WE TRY TO MAKE THIS CULTURE MOVE IN A DIRECTION WHERE. THE VICTIM. DOES THAT THERE IS A SAFE PLACE TO GO. AND THAT WE HOLD ACCOUNTABLE THE PERPETRATORS. AND WE TAKE THE POWER AWAY FROM POLITICIANS. OKAY BECAUSE THIS IS A POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT. TO WEAR THAT'S NOT THAT THE FOX A. GUARDING THE HENHOUSE FOR LACK OF A BETTER TERM MAYBE. AND THEN ON TOP OF THAT NEW TO PUT ANOTHER LITTLE TWIST ON IT. IS. YOU KNOW IN THE IN THE TWENTY TWO YEARS THAT I'VE BEEN IN ELECTED OFFICE IS THE PEOPLE WHO AYE AYE AND WE SAW THIS AT THE LOCAL RAZA COUNTY SUPERVISOR WE HAD TO DEAL WITH SOME OF THESE. JEWISH AND. AND. I WOULD SAY THE MAJORITY THE PEOPLE THAT NEEDED TO GO GET IN TROUBLE NEVER GOT IN TROUBLE AND THE ONES THAT JUST POLITICALLY GOT ACCUSED THAT WERE INNOCENT. LOST THEIR JOB. AND SO WE HAVE A FINE LINE HERE WHERE. BECAUSE OF THE POLITICAL SITUATION. SO MANY CAN ACCUSE SOMEBODY AND IT CAN CHANGE THEIR CAREER EVEN THOUGH THERE WAS MAYBE NO. A. REALITY TO IT SO I'M I WOULD BE ANY OF YOU COULD ANSWER A WE WE WE ARE GOING TO BE STRUGGLING WITH THIS THIS IS THE MAIN QUESTION FOR THIS THIS BODY. IS TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE. PROTECT THE VICTIM. BY ALL MEANS IF SOMEBODY'S. BEEN GUILTY THROW THEM HECK OUT THIS PLACE. AND AND NOT TOLERATE BUT THEN DRIVE THAT FINE LINE OF WHERE WE CHANGE THIS CULTURE HOW DO WE START WHERE DO WE START THAT'S WHAT I'M AFTER SO. ANY TAKERS. I WOULD SAY. THERE ISN'T ANY ONE THING YOU CAN DO THERE A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS YOU CAN DO. I'M AND THE IMPORTANT THING IS TO BEGIN DOING THEM. I AM I THINK THAT THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY TO CHANGE. AND ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE IS TO HAVE ONGOING INCLUSIVE CONVERSATIONS. I AM ABOUT WHAT CULTURAL NORMS DO YOU WANT TO FOSTER. NOT HOW'RE WE GONNA CATCH THE PERPETRATORS AND PUNISH THEM BUT WHAT KIND OF ORGANIZATIONAL CLIMATE DO WE WANT. TO FOSTER. I AM ALSO A BIG ADVOCATE OF OF TYING THIS TO PUBLIC SERVICE VALUES. WE ALL HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO PROVIDE THE VERY BEST WORK. I AM I CONSIDER MYSELF A PART OF OF THE GOVERNMENT'S PROCESS ALTHOUGH I'M JUST A TEACHER. TO DO THE VERY BEST WORK TO BRING IN THE VERY BEST PEOPLE AND GIVE THEM A WORKPLACE WHERE THEY CAN. USE THEIR TALENTS WHERE THEY CAN BE INNOVATIVE AND RESPONSIVE AND RESILIENT. WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT THAT. THE THE CULTURAL NORMS OF SAFETY OF CIVILITY. OF TRUST OF COOPERATION OF COLLABORATION. TARGET IS GONNA MAKE YOUR ORGANIZATION MORE INNOVATIVE IS GONNA MAKE MORE PRODUCTIVE AND IT'S GONNA MAKE IT. BUT MORE RESPONSIVE TO THE PEOPLE THAT WERE TRYING TO SIR. SO IT'S IT'S A PART OF A LARGER CONVERSATION AND I WOULD SAY. THIS ISN'T AN HR ISSUE. THIS IS AN ISSUE OF OF WHAT KIND OF INSTITUTION DOES DO YOU WANT THIS TO BE. AND IT HAS TO BE TOP LEADERSHIP HAS TO BE EVERYONE SPEAKING TO THESE QUESTIONS. AND YOU WANT THESE TO BEAT THE TRAINING IS GREAT EXCEPT FOR THE PEOPLE WHO ARE DOING. THE DASTARDLY DEEDS. CONVERSATIONS SHOULD BE TAKE PLACE ABOUT YOU KNOW WHAT MEN FOR EXAMPLE TO BECOME FRIGHTENED TO WORK WITH WOMEN. YOU DON'T WANT THIS HAVE A CHILLING EFFECT DONE WELL I'M NOT GOING TO HIRE A WOMAN I KNOW I'M GONNA WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH THIS PERSON. I DON'T I'M NOT GONNA TAKE THAT RISK. SO YOU HAVE TO GET MEN TALKING AND WOMEN TALKING AND YOUNG PEOPLE TALKING AND PEOPLE IN. IN HIGH UP AT HIGH LEVELS OF POWER SPEAKING TO EACH OTHER ABOUT. THEIR EXPERIENCE ABOUT WHAT THEY WORRY ABOUT AND WHAT KIND OF WORKPLACE THEY WANT TO BE IN. BECAUSE THAT'S NOT AND JUST MAKE IT BETTER FOR WOMEN. IT'S GOING TO MAKE IT BETTER FOR THE STATE CALIFORNIA'S GOING TO MAKE IT BETTER FOR THE PEOPLE AND THE CITIZENS THAT YOU CARE SO MUCH ABOUT. IN TERMS OF BEING INNOVATIVE-POLICYMAKERS IN TERMS A CALIFORNIA CONTINUING TO BE THE TREND SETTER. IN THIS COUNTRY RIGHT NOW AS FAR AS AS GOVERNANCE. YEAH LET ME. ALSO ADD THAT THAT THEY'RE PRACTICALLY PEOPLE JUDGE YOU BY WHAT YOU DO NOT A WHICH IS. AND THAT'S THE REALITY. YOU HATE TO CALL IT YOU CAN HAVE TO MAKE EXAMPLES OF PEOPLE BUT THE WAY THAT SHE BEGAN TO CHANGE THAT CULTURE IS PEOPLE HAVE TO KNOW THAT YOU REALLY BELIEVE WHAT YOU SAY AND THAT NO ONE IS TOO IMPORTANT TO FAIL I CAME FROM THE INDUSTRY HOLLYWOOD. NONE OF THIS SURPRISED ME AND I WORKED AT BUY COM COMPANIES PARAMOUNT PICTURES SPELLING ENTERTAINMENT. AND I'VE AND A NUMBER OF THEM AS A LAWYER I CONSULTED WITH. IN MANY OF THESE INSTANCES WE KNEW WHO THE PERPETRATORS WHERE WE KNEW WHO THE DIRTY OLD MAN WHERE. BUT IT WAS MONEY IT WAS WE CAN WE CAN PAY FOR THIS AND MAKE THIS GO AWAY HERE SHE IS TO HE AND THIS AND THAT ALL OF THESE INSTANCES HEATH WAS TOO POWERFUL. TO A BIG GENERATED TOO MUCH CASTRO BOTTOM LINE AND SO YOU CAN'T TELL PEOPLE WE HAVE THE SAREK SEXUAL HARASSMENT POLICY. AND FRANKLY TAKE IT YOUR HR PERSON THE HR PERSON TAKE TO THE NEXT LEVEL AND THAT PERSON SAYS. YEAH BUT WHAT WE GONNA DO YOU KNOW HIM. YOU KNOW HOW HE DOESN'T EVERYONE KNOWS HIM. UNTIL YOU START TAKING REAL ACTION WHEN PEOPLE SEE IT THEN THEY WILL TRUST YOU AND THAT'S THE BEGINNING OF THE CULTURAL TRANSFORMATION IF THEY CAN'T TRUST YOU. THEY WILL NEVER BE SAFE ENOUGH TO REPORT IT TO YOU SURELY ASSIST THAT DOUBLE TROUBLE SEX HARASSMENT TRAINING COURSES THAT YOU WANT AND SOME WELL INTENDED PEOPLE JUST WON'T FEEL SAFE ENOUGH TO BRING IT TO LIGHT. BECAUSE THEY DON'T BELIEVE IT WILL MATTER ANYWAY THAT'S WHAT YOU ALL CAN DO A NIGHT AND I DON'T MEAN TO SUGGEST THAT YOU NEED TO GO OUT AND. AND YOU KNOW MAKE A PUBLIC EXAMPLE OF SOMEONE BUT IT MIGHT NOT BE SUCH A BAD IDEA BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE SAW IN THE INDUSTRY AS A SAID I CAME FROM THAT INDUSTRY. EVERYONE KNEW WHAT WAS GOING ON IN ALL OF THOSE INSTANCES MATT LAUER THAT WASN'T A SURPRISE TO SO MANY PEOPLE AND THAT'S A YOU KNOW WE KNEW WHAT TO WHAT WHAT WAS HAPPENING AND WEINSTEIN SHOT EVERYONE KNEW. AND THOSE ARE REAL NAMES AND IT WAS ONLY UNTIL PEOPLE REALIZED ALL MY GOSH THEY WOULD TAKE DOWN SOME ONE THAT BIG. THAT THIS MOVEMENT HAS BEEN BORN I WOULD SUBMIT TO YOU THAT IF YOU WANT TO DO THAT IN A BALL OF THE STATE LEGISLATURES. AROUND THE COUNTRY WANT TO DO THAT MAKE A FEW EXAMPLES I LIVE IN WASHINGTON DC RIGHT NOW LET ME TELL YOUAFTER THAT SPATE OF A FEW OF THEM EVEN THE. MOST PROTECTED. STEPPED DOWN PEOPLE NOW BELIEVE IT THIS IS CHANGE THAT THEY CAN BELIEVE IT. CAN I JUST ADD DATA CAN HELP. A LOT OF OF CORPORATIONS AND AND ORGANIZATIONS USE CLIMATE SURVEYS. I THINK. MOST OF THEM ARE REALLY BAD. OF AT AND I THE AND DEFENSIVE. BUT WHAT YOU CAN DO IS YOU CAN HAVE. A CONFIDENTIAL SURVEY. THAT ASKS PEOPLE ABOUT. HOW DO HOW SAFE DO THEY FEEL? I'M HOW SURE ARE ARE THEY OF THE KIND OF BEHAVIOR THAT'S EXPECTED OF THEM. HOW SURE ARE THEY? WHERE TO GO IF IF THEY HAVE AN ISSUE WHERE THEY WANT SOME HELP? SO YOU HAVE SOME INFORMATION AS TO THE EXTENT THE PROBLEM BEFORE YOU START START TO FIX. DO WELL TO YOUR COMMENT. I WASN'T SURE WHEN YOU WOULD IF YOU WERE TRYING TO SPEAK. OUR NOW THINK YOU IT'S ALWAYS HARD NOT BEING IN THE ROOMS I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT VERY GOOD EXAMPLE OF THE THOUGHTFUL BEHAVIOR IT'S INCREASED FEELINGS OF SAFETY AND GIVE PEOPLE A VOICE IS GREAT MODELING. I THINK OUT WE DO A LOT OF THE SURVEYS AND I THINK WHAT'S REALLY INTERESTING ALSO IS TO TIE. ON ITS HIGH NEED DIFFERENT CONSEQUENCES TOGETHER IN THE REPORT THAT BACK OUT YOUR WORKFORCE SO FOR EXAMPLE WHEN PEOPLE DON'T GET EIGHT. WE ALSO SEE THAT FOR THEIR PERFORMANCE STARTS TO DECLINE WE THEATER LESS LIKELY TO STAY IN YOUR ORGANIZATION WITH THE PEOPLE NOT CONTRIBUTING AS MUCH IN THEIR WORK NOT SPEAKING UP IN MEETINGS ALSO HELPING. HELPING ORGANIZATION THROUGH DATA UNDERSTAND THE BROADER IMPLICATIONS OF CREATING ENVIRONMENTS WHERE PEOPLE DON'T FEEL SAFE AND SECURE BECAUSE. I IT'S NOT JUST SINGING IMPACT PEOPLE'S WELLBEING THING THAT IMPACTS YOUR ENTIRE ORGANIZATIONS ABILITY I THINK YOU IT'S PAST WORK. THANK YOU FOR ENCOURAGING THE GOOD BEHAVIOR OF ASKING YOU. COMMENT. PERFECT EXAMPLE OF HOW THIS CAN ALL WORK A SENATOR MITCHELL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ON AS WE DEVELOP TODAY'S AGENDA WAS VERY PORTANTINO THE CHAIR AND I THAT WE SPEND QUALITY TIME TALK ABOUT CULTURE BECAUSE AND SO I WANNA. KIND OF FOLLOW UP ON THE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS QUESTION. DID WAS A LITTLE DIFFERENT WITH. WHAT I ALSO REALIZE? THAT THAT THERE'S A DANGER IN HAVING THIS CONVERSATION IN THIS ENVIRONMENT BECAUSE I'M SURE THERE'S A BIG COLLECTIVE AYE ROLL GOING ON RIGHT NOW ON THE CAPITAL. BEING PERPETRATED BY MANY OF OUR SITTING COLLEAGUES ON AND SOME OF THE EXTERNAL STAKEHOLDERS AND YOU KNOW THEY'RE WASTING TIME TO TALK ABOUT CULTURE WHAT IS CULTURE WHAT IS THAT REALLY ME ECCENTRIC CETERA. AND SOLD IT IN ORDER TO NOT MISS OUT ON THIS WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY. AND THE HAVE A MEANINGFUL CONVERSATION ABOUT CULTURE. I'M SITTING HERE LISTENING TO YOU AND REALLY TRYING TO COME UP WITH TANGIBLE EXAMPLES OF WHAT WE CAN DO. I THINK THERE IS THIS X. THIS EXPECTATION WHICH IS TYPICAL IN OUR ENVIRONMENT THAT THIS COMMITTEE IS GOING TO FIGURE IT OUT AND WE'RE GONNA ROLL OUT THE ANSWER THAT EVERYONE WILL SIMPLY COMPLY. WELL AS YOU ALL. BRILLIANTLY ARTICULATE IF THAT'S NOT HOW CULTURE WORKS. SO THAT I'M I'M SITTING HERE THINKING ABOUT MY OWN PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE COMING FROM AT EXECUTIVE MANAGEMENT IN THE NONPROFIT SECTOR WHERE. CULTURE WAS INGRAINED WE'RE MISSION DRIVEN ORGANIZATION SO CULTURE WAS FIRST. ON OUR AGENDA. WHEN I CAME TO THE LEGISLATURE I BROUGHT THAT EXPERIENCE WITH ME SO ON THE WALLS IN MY OFFICE ON THE FRONT DOOR LEADING TO MY OFFICE IN MY OPEN AREA. IS MY TEAMS. VALUE STATEMENT. OF OF WHAT WE. COMMIT TO TO BE A MEMBER OF TEAM MITCHELL. AND WHAT WE BRING TO OUR WORK EVERY DAY. SO IT HIT ME. SITTING HERE LISTENING TO YOU CAN YOU GIVE US. I KNOW MATTHEW TO SPOON FEED US AND I'M ASKING YOU TO DO THAT. TANGIBLE EXAMPLES LIKE THAT. THAT THE COLLECTIVE AYE ROLLERS CAN CHEW ON DIED YES TO THINK ABOUT WHAT INDIVIDUALLY WE CAN DO WHETHER YOU'RE IN LEADERSHIP OR YOU'RE A FRESHMAN MEMBER OF EITHER HOUSE. CAN DO TO BEGIN TO TALK ABOUT CULTURE AND INCORPORATE. A HEALTHY WORKPLACE CULTURE. IN YOUR TEAM. INDIVIDUALLY. WE'RE HUNDRED TWENTY LEGISLATORS OF IT EACH OF US DID THAT. THAT WOULD BEGIN TO CREATE THE CULTURE HERE THAT WE TEND TO SPEAK ABOUT IN MORE ABSTRACT TERMS. I NEED. HOMEWORK PLEASE SAGA PROJECT FOR YOU WE DID IN ONE OF MY LAST SIGH SO. THE SENIOR MANAGEMENT TEAM. A GROUP AUGUST GROUP LIKE YOU CAME TOGETHER AND SAID WHAT'S THE CULTURE HERE. AND WE ALL SAT AROUND IN THIS BUBBLE AND CAME UP WITH WORDS AND REALLY FANCY LITTLE DESCRIPTIONS OF WHAT IT MEANT TO WORK HERE. WE DECIDED BRILLIANT IT'S WHERE BEAUTIFULLY WERE NOT A ROLL IT OUT TO THE ORGANISATION THE ORGANISATION BICU. AND SAID THAT'S NOT WHERE WE WORK. THE SWITCH YOU ALL DREAMING ABOUT AS RACIAL DOESN'T SHE FEEL GOOD ABOUT THAT THAT'S NOT WHERE WE WORK. SO WE ROLLED IT ALL BACK AND WE DID FARE SIMPLY WILL S. SIMPLICISSIMUS WE WENT OUT ALL OF THE EMPLOYEES AND NOT A CIRCLE OR CHECKBOX HE SAID. TELL US THE TEN WORDS THAT COME TO MIND BURST. WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO WORK HERE NOT WHAT WE ASPIRE TO BE? WHAT IS IT MEAN TO WORK HERE IT'S A VERY SIMPLE ACCESS? AND WHEN YOU GATHER ALL OF THAT DATA IT'LL BECOME PRETTY CLEAR TO YOU WHAT YOUR CULTURE IS AT THAT POINT YOU THEN DECIDE WHAT YOU WANT IT TO BE AND THAT'S THE GAP AND YOU FIGURE OUT THAT WHAT ARE THE SPECIFIC INTERVIEW. YOU PUT IN PLACE BUT SOMETHING AS PRACTICAL AS SPEAKING TO THE EMPLOYEES NOT YOU KNOW ONE OF THE CHALLENGES AND WE AN HR GOT PAST YOU SIMPLY SATISFACTION. WHAT DOES NOT A FEW NEED EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT I DON'T JUST WANT YOU SATISFIED IMAGINE TALK WITH YOUR SPOUSE OR SIGNIFICANT OTHER PRINTS ARE YOU SATISFIED? BY WHAT YOU ENGAGED AND THERE'S A BIG DIFFERENCE BUT THIS IS A VERY DIFFERENT EXERCISE THIS IS ABOUT DESCRIBE WHAT IT MEANS TO WORK HERE AS. MY GOV TELE PANELISTS ASK QUESTION WHAT'S IT REALLY LIKE TO WORK HERE. AND THEY WILL TELL YOU VERY QUICKLY AND SOME OF THE SEX HARASSMENT ISSUES COME OUT SOME RACE DISCRIMINATION SOME SAYS THAT YOU CAN'T BE PROMOTED. THE GOOD AND THE BAD WILL COME OUT ITS A VERY PRACTICAL WAY BUT ONE OF THE DANGERS. IS THAT WE TELL PEOPLE WHAT WE ASPIRE WHAT WE WANT OUR VALUES TO BE OR WHAT WE PERSONALITY I MIGHT ACTUALLY BELIEVE YOU WANT THIS TO BE. IT THE QUESTION IS TO THE PEOPLE IN YOUR ORGANIZATION AGREED THAT THAT'S WHERE THEY WORK. I AM I RIGHT. PLEASE LEAVE AGREE WITH THAT. AND I WOULD SAY THAT ONCE YOU'VE ONCE YOU GO TO EMPLOYEES AND ASK THEM ABOUT WHAT YOU KNOW WHAT AT THAT BUT WHAT DESCRIBES YOUR WORKPLACE. TO THEN GO BACK TO THEM AFTER YOU COLLECT THAT DATA AND SAY YOU. WHAT DO YOU WANT YOUR WORKPLACE TO BE LIKE? AND SO. IF YOU DON'T THEN TAKE ALL THE STATE AND SAY WELL NO NOW WE'RE GOING TO CHANGE IT AND THESE ARE GONNA BE THE VALUES IF YOU GO BACK TO THOSE SAME EMPLOYEES AND SAY. OKAY WHAT WHAT DO YOU WANT THIS TO BE. AND IT TAKES I AM IN THE. WE DO NEXT. EXTENSIVE STUDY IN THE CITY OF PHOENIX AND THAT'S EXACTLY THE PROCESS THEY FOLLOWED. THEY WENT BACK AND THEY CAME UP WITH SEVEN STATEMENTS OF VALUE. SIMILAR TO WHAT YOU HAVE ON YOUR DOOR. BUT IT WAS IT WAS. IT WAS A PROCESS WHERE EVERY SINGLE EMPLOYEE PARTICIPATED IN SOME. UP SOME FASHION. AND THEN ONCE THOSE VALUES WERE ARTICULATED THAT WERE PUT EVERYWHERE. AND THEN YOU AND THEN THEY USED. THEY USED EXAMPLES AND STORIES TO ILLUSTRATE HOW THOSE VALUES WERE PUTTING BEING PUT INTO PLACE. SO I WOULD SAY IF YOU IF YOU WANT A LIST OF THINGS TO DO. I WOULD SAY COLLECT DATA I LIKE YOUR IDEA OF OF SPEAKING DIRECTLY TO EMPLOYEES. YOU KNOW SURVEYS ARE OKAY BUT I BUT I AM I THINK CONVERSATION ENGAGEMENT IS BETTER. I DO THINK THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT STRUCTURALLY ARE EXCELLENT. COMING UP WITH A JOINT PROCESS FOR REPORTING PROVIDING THE SUPPORTIVE ENVIRONMENT FOR ON PEOPLE WHO COME FORWARD ALSO PROVIDING A SUPPORTIVE ENVIRONMENT COUNSELING FOR PEOPLE WHO DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. BETTER. OF. I WOULD ALSO SAY THAT. TRAINING. IS IS GOOD. BUT IT'S IT'S. A LOT OF PPL DON'T DO ANYTHING WHEN THEY SEE SOMETHING BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO RIGHT. THEY JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT KIND HOW TO BE PROACTIVE HOW TO BE POSITIVE IN THIS AREA AND THAT CAN BE VERY VERY HELPFUL. AND AND YOU WANNA ENCOURAGE. EVERYWHERE AND AND AND AND YOU KNOW IT THIS ISN'T JUST A WOMEN'S ISSUE MAN ARCTIC JUST THE ONLY PERPETRATORS BUT MATTER CONFUSED. INTO MY SONS ARE CONFUSED. UP TO THIS IS NOT. THIS ISN'T SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED OVERNIGHT AND WE ALL NEED HELP IN HOW TO IN EIGHTEEN HOW TO BE SUPPORTIVE HOW TO LISTEN AND HOW TO BEHAVE. AND AGAIN THIS ISN'T ABOUT. THIS ISN'T ABOUT CRIMINAL ACTIVITY IS ABOUT MAKING THE ORGANIZATION BETTER. BUT THE OTHER THING I WOULD SAY TO AFFECTS OUR STATE IS NOT ABOUT SEX EITHER. OUR POWER GRIDS WITH THAT YEAH THE OTHER THING AB SEES IN THE MISSING ELEMENT THOUGH IS ONCE YOU COME UP WITH THESE VALUES AND WE PUT THEM UP SO COMING UP THE RIGHT SAID IS IMPORTANT AS WE'VE JUST DESCRIBED. BUT THEN YOU GOT IT ACTUALLY HOLD PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE. AND SO THAT IF THEIR BEHAVIORS IF YOU SAY FOR EXAMPLE WE VALUE OPENNESS AND TRANSPARENCY WHEN THEY ARE EXAMPLES BEFORE YOU GET TO SEXUAL HARASSMENT WORKED OF RACE DISCRIMINATION ANY. WHEN THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO DON'T LIVE BY THOSE VALUES YOU'VE GOT TO EXPEL THEM. THERE'S JUST NO OTHER WAY TO DO IT AND YOU CAN'T DO IT SUBTLY BECAUSE IT IS SO SUBTLE AND THAT'S THE DIFFICULTY OF PERSONNEL MATTERS NEEDING TO. HELD CONFIDENTIAL IF PEOPLE DON'T KNOW WHY THE PERSON IS HELD THEY MAY HAVE BUT PERSON JUST GOT ANOTHER JOB. WE DON'T UNDERSTAND THEY'RE NOT MAKING THE CONNECTION BECAUSE WE GO TO SUCH LENGTHS TO HIDE IT. SO PART OF IT IS IF YOU'RE GOING TO SEE THIS IS WHAT IT MEANS TO WORK HERE AND IF YOU DON'T LIVE WITH THEM THIS NO MORE. YOU ARE VOTED OFF THE ISLAND PEOPLE HAVE TO KNOW THAT THE PERSON IS VOTED OFF THE ISLAND FOR THAT AGAIN WITHOUT DISCLOSING HIGHLY HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION BUT THAT'S THE DISCONNECTED WE HEAR THAT FROM EMPLOYEES ALL THE TIME WE KIND OF QUIETLYLET SOMEONE GO AWAY. AND SO THE PEOPLE WHO WAITING TO BELIEVE IN YOU. DON'T UNDERSTAND ATTRACT DID YOUR JOB THEY JUST DIDN'T KNOW THAT THE JOB WAS DONE AND SO YOU DON'T GET. PEOPLE TO COME FOR TO THINK THAT'S CRITICAL IN THE LAST. POINT THAT I WOULD ASK YOU TO THINK ABOUT THIS TOO OFTEN WE SAY THINGS THAT I DON'T THINK YOU LITERALLY MADE IT WELL THIS ISN'T AN HR PROBLEM. YES IT IS. THIS AYE OUR PROFESSION IS HERE TO HELP YOU WE ARE RESPONSIBLE JUSTICE THE FINANCIAL THE CFO'S. WHERE THE BUDGET DIRECTOR RESPONSIBLE FOR HELPING YOU SORT OF CHANNEL AND DIRECT AND MANAGE YOUR FINANCIAL RESOURCES OUR JOB IS TO DO THE SAME THING WITH YOUR HUMAN RESOURCES? AND SO IF YOU SIMPLY TAKE YOUR HR FUNCTION AS A PERSONNEL COMMISSION AN ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTION PEOPLE WHO YOU GOT OUT OF THE OUT THIS PAPERWORK TO GET YOUR BENEFITS. YOU'RE NOT TAKING ADVANTAGE OF A WORLD CLASS HR FUNCTION WE ARE THE NURTURERS AND KEEPERS OF CULTURE. I JUST WANTED DAY AND ONE BRIEF POINT WE'VE BEEN TALKING A LOT ABOUT ACCOUNTABILITY AND HOW TO HOLD PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE WITH A SWIFT ACTION WHEN THEY DON'T LIVE OUR VALUES. I JUST WANNA KIND OF HIGHLY THAT IT'S ALSO EQUALLY IMPORTANT SAID RECOGNIZE AND REWARD PEOPLE COULD DO. AND I THINK SOMETIMES THAT GETS MISSED IN THIS DISCUSSION BUT. Y. TO REALLY LIVE YOUR VALUES YOU HAVE TO BOTH HOLD PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE WHEN THEY ACT OUTSIDE OF THEM. AND ELEVATE PEOPLE WHO ACT INSIDE OF THEM MAKE SURE EVERYONE SEES YOU RECOGNIZING AND REWARDING PEOPLE THAT ARE INCLUSIVE PEOPLE THAT ARE THREE. PEOPLE THAT GIVE OTHERS THE FLOOR PEOPLE THAT INVITE OTHERS IN. CREATING INCLUSIVE CULTURE REQUIRES BOTH THAT CARROT AND STICK APPROACH ON. ALCOHOL I WENT BACK AT THE NORTH FOR THIRTY BUT I THINK THAT THAT'S REALLY REALLY KEEPS YOU. I JUST I JUST WANTED TO ADD. FOLLOWING UP ON YOUR POINT ABOUT THE SWIFT ACTION. WHEN YOU HAVE AN ELECTED OFFICIAL OR A OR A FACULTY MEMBER WITH. LIFETIME TENURE THAT SWIFT ACTION IS NOT QUITE AS EASY AS. FOR OTHER EMPLOYEES SO I THINK THAT'S WHERE. SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TERMS OF TRANSPARENCY ARE REALLY IMPORTANT I'M GIVING COMPLIANCE INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT YOU'VE DONE WHAT YOU CAN DO. AND ACCOUNTABILITY WILL WILL. OFTEN FOLLOW THE CULTURE RIGHT SO IN THE IN THE YOU SEE YOU'VE HAD THE PIERCED THE FACULTY MEMBERS THEMSELVES STARTING TO HOLD THEIR COLLEAGUES ACCOUNTABLE AND WE HAVE TO DO THAT BECAUSE IT'S THE FACULTY WHO. A PLAN THEMSELVES ON SOME LEVEL IN THE UC. SO THEY HAVE TO BUY INTO THIS BEFORE THEY'RE GOING TO HOLD THEIR COLLEAGUES ACCOUNTABLE. WHAT QUESTIONS SHOULD BE I MEAN IT'S EASY TO SAY THAT'S THE WAY IT IS BUT THAT'S NOT OKAY TO SAY WHAT WE TREAT THESE PEOPLE DIFFERENT BECAUSE THEY HAVE TENURE THAT'S RIDICULOUS IF YOU ARE A? CREDIT OR YOU ARE A PREDATOR AND WE SHOULD NOT ACCEPT EFFECT YOU SHOULD BE HELD TO A HIGHER STANDARD. CHILDREN PEOPLE'S LIVES WHO YOU'RE INFECTED A THE IMPACT AND SO I DON'T THINK IT'S OKAY TO SAY THEY HAVE A DIFFERENT STANDARD JUMEAU SWIFT BECAUSE YOU NEED TO MOVE SWIFTLY. IF SOMEONE IS RUINING SOMEONE'S LIKE THE PROFESSOR BUT I'M MENTION THE GEORGE JUST THROUGH TECHNOLOGY SHE SET BACK. IN THIS PROCESS OF GOING THROUGH ALL OF THIS YOU ARE DESTROYING SOMEONE'S LIFE THAT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE SO I WOULD SUBMIT TO YOU THAT YOUR JOB LEGISLATORS IS TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DEAL WITH THAT. THE IDEA THAT THESE PEOPLE ARE SPECIAL AND CAN'T BE DEALT WITH BECAUSE THEY HAVE A PEACE DE ARROBA TO BOOKS AND HAVE TENURE IS SUBSCRIBER. MISTER MISTER CHAIR WE GET OUT WE CAN ALL ARRANGE FOR THE SECURITY TO HELP THEM GET UP THAT HILL. I JUST WANTED TO HAVE ONE REALLY PRACTICAL POINT. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THEY DID IN AND. CITY OF PHOENIX WAS THAT ONCE THEY CAME UP WITH THESE VALUES THAT BECAME THE STRUCTURE FOR EMPLOYEE EVALUATIONS. HOW HAVE YOU CONTRIBUTED TO THIS VALUE? IT'S A WAY TO STRUCTURALLY CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION. AND TO MAKE IT LIVING TO MAKE A LIVING AND I KNOW THAT YOU DON'T DO PERFORMANCE EVALUATIONS OF LEGISLATORS. A BUT IF YOU ASK THEM TO. NDA BUT NOT STAFF BUT BUT IT KEEPS WOULD HAVE STAFF IF IF THAT'S THE WAY STAFFERS EVALUATED AT LEAST THE CONVERSATION CONTINUES RIGHT. I WAS GONNA GOING TO MISS. IMMERSE AND. SHE'S GONE I'M GONNA STATE MY QUESTION FOR THE RECORD AND SO WE CAN JUST GET BACK TO HER JUST SO SHE KNOWS AND THEN MADAM CHAIR I HAVE ONE MORE QUESTION ON TO MY QUESTION THIS IMMERSE AND. I'VE READ HER ARTICLE IN THE HARVARD BUSINESS REVIEW WITH REGARD TO ON IMPLICIT BIAS. AND MY QUESTION WAS IF THERE WAS AN INTERSECTION BETWEEN IMPLICIT BIAS TRAINING AND SEXUAL HARASSMENT. INSIDE JUST CURIOUS ABOUT THAT SHOULDN'T TOUCH ON THAT. UP. MR. TAYLOR I CAN GO BACK TO YOU I I HAD A VICE PRESIDENT HR WHO REQUIRE THAT I SINCE SHE IN MY ENTIRE HR DEPARTMENT TO THE SHARM CONFERENCES IN LAS VEGAS EVERY YEAR SESSION WAS A BELIEVER. AND. UP AND AND CONVINCE ME THAT HR MUST ACT AS THE CONSCIOUS OF THE COMPANY SO I SEE THAT IN YOUR STATEMENT AS WELL SO. YOU YOU YOU BRAINWASHED PEOPLE YEAH BUT THEY CAME BACK AND THEY. BEADED OVER MY HEAD I I GOT IT. AND YOU KNOW AS WE YOU KNOW MY FATHER TO ME IS A GO YOU PUT ONE FINGER OUT THERE THREE POINTING BACK AT YOU. AND SO. I WONDER WHAT WE HAVE DONE IS THE LEGISLATURE TO OUR BUDGETING PROCESS. IN MAKING SURE S. COLLINS WOULD SAY WE HAVE THE RIGHT PEOPLE IN THE RIGHT SEATS ON THE BUS IN OUR OWN HR FUNCTIONS. IF WE. HAVE BOTH EMPOWER THEM FASHION THEIR JOB STATEMENTS DEVELOP REIMBURSEMENT. THAT'S APPROPRIATE FOR WHAT WE NEED GIVEN THE UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANTIAL SOMETIMES WE GET LOCKED INTO. ON THE STATE HR WE BUY INTO THEIR JOB DESCRIPTIONS AND I'M WONDERING IF WE NEED TO DO A BETTER JOB OF BUILDING AN HR FUNCTION FUNCTION. AND PAYING FOR AN INCREASE IN THE SLOTS IN THE POSITIONS. THAT TRULY MEET THE NEEDS. THE UNIQUE AND RATHER CUSTOMARY NEEDS OF AN ORGANIZATION THE SIZE THAT WE ARE SENATE HAS NINE HUNDRED EMPLOYEES THE ASSEMBLY HAVE PROBABLY ALMOST DOUBLE THAT. AND SO YOU KNOW I I SOMETIMES GOVERNMENT YOU KNOW WE WE BELIEVE THE LOWEST BID GETS THERE. AND SO. WE PROBABLY NEED TO LOOK DEEPLY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE STRUCTURE AND THE JOB DESCRIPTIONS AND THEREFORE THE PEOPLE THAT ARE RIGHT. AND SO HAVING HAVE THAT AHA MOMENT. I'M WONDERING IF IF YOU CAN TELL US HOW YOU ASSESS IT AN HR DEPARTMENT IS FUNCTIONING WELL. SO THAT SAU THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS SO WE HAVE A CERTIFICATION. A YOU KNOW JUST AS THE. CPA FOR FOR FOUR FINANCE PROFESSIONALS AND NOT LICENSURE LIKE LAWYERS AND MEDICAL DOCTORS BUT BUT BUT CERTIFICATION. THAT WE CALL THE SHARM BODY OF COMPETENCY AND KNOWLEDGE. AND WE CALL IT BLOCK AND AND THE FOCUS THERE IS IT WILL ALLOW YOU TO KNOW IF THE PERSON HAS THE NECESSARY SKILLS TO OPERATE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY. HR. WHO FRANKLY OFTENTIMES MY EXPERIENCE IN DEALING WITH PEOPLE IN STATE LEGISLATURES UP LATE STEP STATE ENVIRONMENT HR FUNCTIONS IS THAT THEY'RE STILL A LITTLE BIT OF A PERSONNEL NATURE TO WHAT THEY DO IT'S VERY ADMINISTRATIVE IMMENSE NOT IN KEEPING WITH A SORT OF HUMAN CAPITAL? TYPE APPROACH TO HR AND SAID YOU'RE NOT GETTING THE BEST PEOPLE BECAUSE THE BEST PEOPLE WHAT REALLY. HARD DIFFICULT THORNY COMPLEX JOBS AND IF THEY ARE RELEGATED TO JUST DOING STUFF PUSHING PAPER THEN THEY WON'T COME THEY ARE AND THE RESULT IS IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE BEST PEOPLE IN HR. YOU CAN EXPECT TO DROP THIS CULTURE DISCUSSIONS I THINK YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY SPOT ON AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'RE DISCUSSING AS A PROFESSION THEY NEED TRAINING. AND THEY NEED CONSISTENT TRAINING BECAUSE THIS THING IS CHANGING TWO YEARS AGO WE WERE TALKING ABOUT SEXUAL HARASSMENT MEET. WE DIDN'T HAVE THESE DISCUSSIONS WERE TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE SO IT'S NOT LIKE YOU CAN SEND SOMEONE TO TRAINING. ONE YEAR ONCE EVERY FIVE YEARS AND THINK THEY'VE GOT IT AYE I THANK YOU FOR SENDING AND COMMITTING TO SENDING YOUR VP OF HR IN TEEN THERE BECAUSE THEY ARE CONSTANTLY. EVOLVING AS WELL BUT THE KEY IS TO. FIND THE RIGHT HRP. AND THAT DOES TAKE A YOU KNOW BUT I OFTENTIMES MY TEST FOR THEM AS I ASKED HIM ABOUT COURAGE. IN THE PROCESS I CLEARLY WANNA KNOW IF YOU'D EXPERT IF YOU'RE SUBJECT MATTER EXPERT AND YOU UNDERSTAND. THE COMPETENCIES AND AND THE BODY OF KNOWLEDGE OF HR BUT THEN I WON UNDERSTAND BECAUSE YOU CAN KNOW IT BUT BE AFRAID TO. TO USE IT AND TO PRACTICE AND SO THAT'S ONE OF OUR QUESTIONS IS. ARE YOU READY TO DO IT WHEN YOU'RE FACED WITH ONE OF THOSE DILEMMAS WHEN YOU HAVE TO COME AND MEET WITH A PERSON POWER AND HAVE AN HONEST CONVERSATION ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT. THAT THEY'RE CREATING IN THEIR WORKPLACE AND IF YOU DON'T HAVE THAT PERSON NO MATTER HOW TALENTED THEY ARE. YOU HAVE A PROBLEM SO CERTIFICATIONS NUMBER ONE AND THEN LOOKING FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE THAT COURAGE. IF I COULD IF I COULD TRY MEN I I'M I'M NOT HR. BUT I THINK THE UNIVERSITY HAVING THAT REQUIREMENTS HAVE AN INDEPENDENT OFFICE WHICH OVERSEES THE POLICY REPORTS A VERY HIGH LEVEL. YOU KNOW AT. THE ONLY PERSON WHO I MEAN MY CLIENT I ALWAYS SAY IS NOT THE UNIVERSITY IT'S GENDER EQUITY. AND AND THOSE ARE THOSE ARE LEGAL MANDATES UNDER THE FEDERAL SCHEME BUT THERE'S NO REASON WHY. YOU COULDN'T REPLICATE SOMETHING LIKE THAT WHERE YOU REALLY HAVE. A FULLY INDEPENDENT OFFICE THAT YES GETS ITS PAYCHECK FROM THE LEGISLATURE BUT OTHERWISE. REPORTS INDEPENDENTLY. ASSEMBLYMEMBER WALDRON. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. SCOOP UP. SHORTER QUESTIONS IN UP INSIDE TO SEE MISS EMERSON GO BECAUSE I THINK SHE PROBABLY WOULD HAVE BEEN GOOD FOR THIS ONE. AS WELL AS MISS SOMEBODY. YOU KNOW WE'VE DONE ALLOTS IN OUR CULTURE REGARDING BULLYING. YOU KNOW AND IN THE SCHOOL SETTING AS A MOM YOU NO. THAT'S KIND OF BEEN AN ONGOING THING SINCE NOW MY SON IS SIXTEEN MINUTES YOU KNOW SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN DEVELOPING. AND USING NEW TECHNOLOGIES YOU KNOW IN THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY. IS NOT REALLY THE FORTE OF THE STATE LEGISLATURE I CAN TELL YOU THAT BECAUSE WE ARE STILL WAY BACK AS FAR AS THAT GOES. BUT YOU KNOW LOOKING AT WHAT HAS BEEN DONE WITH YOUNG PEOPLE TRYING TWO GET THAT HERE I MEAN PEERS ARE SO IMPORTANT TO YOUNG PEOPLE. AND HOW THEY ARE ABLE TO USE NEW TECHNOLOGIES. TO. EMPOWER EACH OTHER. ATTACKED TO MAYBE REPORT AND THERE'S APPS YOU KNOW OUT THERE THAT YOUNG PEOPLE CAN USE. THERE'S DIFFERENT NAMES I'VE SEEN ONE OF LIKE AYE. AN AYE ICON LOOKING AYE ABLE THING. AND THAT SOMEONE POSTS SOMETHING THAT IS. YOU KNOW. IT SHOWS AND TOLERANCE YOU KNOW IT COULD BE ANY NOT JUST SEXUAL IT COULD BE RACIAL INTOLERANCE YOU KNOW. AGAINST THE TRANSGENDER PERSON. OR AGE OR YOU KNOW WHATEVER IT IS. A RACIALLY MOTIVATED OR CULTURAL. THEY CAN PUT THAT. ICON. AND THAT'S SAYS SOMEONE'S WATCHING YOUR PEERS OR WATCHING AND THEN OTHER PEOPLE JOIN IN WITH THAT. AND THEN THAT PERSON IS ISOLATED IN THE ONE WHO DID IT IN THAT MAYBE THEY'LL SAY WELL YOU KNOW I. OFTEN DO THAT ANYMORE THIS THING GET THE RESPONSE THAT I WANTED. I THINK AND AND. WHEN ONE OF OUR OTHER HEARINGS THE ONE OF THE ATTORNEY GROUPS HAD TALKED ABOUT. THAT PEER CULTURE IN A WORKPLACE. AND. I THINK THAT'S SO IMPORTANT BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE DO A LOT OF THINGS IN THE LEGISLATURE AND OUR STAFF SO WITH US. WE GO TO RECEPTIONS OFF SITE WHERE IT MEETINGS WERE ACT SOCIAL GATHERINGS IN OUR DISTRICTS WHERE THERE'S LOTS OF PEOPLE FROM THE PUBLIC AS WELL AS. YOU KNOW STAFF AT ALL LEVELS. AND. PEOPLE SEE THINGS THEY MAY QUESTION OR THEY THINK THAT'S NOT APPROPRIATE YOU KNOW HOW DO WE BE ABLE IS THERE. THE ABILITY OR HAS THAT BEEN DEVELOPING IN THIS TYPE OF ISSUE. IN THE CORPORATE SETTING TAKING IT FROM WHAT WE'VE DONE IN EDUCATION. TO ALLOW PEERS TO START TO SAY. YOU KNOW THIS IS AN APPROPRIATE. OR REMINDING SOMEONE YOU KNOW WE SAW WHAT YOU DID OR. USING TECHNOLOGY EVEN HOW DO WE. YEAH BIT WILL NOT ALLOWING IT TO PROGRESS LIKE IT HAPPENS. AN I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S EVEN ANYTHING THAT IS BEING USED IN MODERN. YOU KNOW. BUT I THINK THAT'S REALLY PART OF HOW WE DEVELOPED CULTURE. MISS EVERYONE WE HAVE LIKE WE SAID YOUNG STAFF YOUNG INTERN SERVED. ROLL UP I MEAN. YOU KNOW I I HAVE TO ASK MY SON HOW TO FIX MY OPINION THINGS HE CAN DO IT. TO INVEST TWO SECONDS. SO. I THINK THAT WOULD BE A WAY TO STOP OUR. IN ON. AND I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S EVEN. ON THE TABLE. FOR I MEAN I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT I THINK THAT THE STUDENTS HAVE COME UP WITH A LOT OF INNOVATIVE PURER. SELF GOVERNING IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT. REPORTING OPTIONS FOR YOUNGER PEOPLE WHO DON'T FEEL EMPOWERED. THERE'S A LOT OF TECH THERE'S WIDE ABSENT TECHNOLOGY FOR SORT OF ANONYMOUS REPORTING. ON THE COLLEGES ARE STARTING TO USE WHICH MAKE A LOT OF SENSE. SO I THINK THAT WOULD BE A VERY GOOD IDEA. BUT ALSO TO YOUR POINT. IT'S ABOUT YOUR PEERS AND IF YOU'RE NOT USING TECHNOLOGY. WHAT ARE OTHER WAYS THAT WE CAN HOLD? PIERRE IS ACCOUNTABLE ABOUT SORT OF WHAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT WITH THE FACULTY NOT THAT WE WERE PLAYING A DIFFERENT STANDARD. FOR DISCIPLINING THEM AS MUCH AS IT WAS IMPORTANT TO HAVE. OUR OWN PEERS HOLD US ACCOUNTABLE. MY YEAH WHAT WAS ONE OF THE ANTINAUSEA SINCE IT'S SOMEWHAT LIKE AN APP CALLED SPEAK UP YOU CAN DO ANONYMOUS REPORTING. FOR BULLYING OPPRESSION YOU KNOW WHAT YOU NOTICES THEIR SAFETY THREAT. IT COULD BE A LOT OF THINGS BUT I THINK SEXUAL HARASSMENT COULD BE PART OF THAT THERE ARE AND THERE THERE ARE ALSO APPLICATIONS THAT. WOULD COLLECT BECAUSE A LOT OF TIME SOMEONE DOESN'T ONE REPORT. ON BECAUSE THEY THINK A WELL IT'S JUST I PROBABLY IMAGINED IT OR MAYBE I'M MAKING TOO BIG A DEAL OUT OF THIS BUT IF THEY KNOW THAT THE PERSON HAS DONE IT TO SOMEONE ELSE. THEY'RE MUCH MORE LIKELY TO COME FORWARD AND REPORT SO THERE'S NOW TECHNOLOGY THAT'S COLLECTING. REPORTS. ON THE CONDITION OF HE LET ME KNOW IF SOMEONE ELSE REPORTS THIS PERSON AS WELL AND NOT WOULD CHANGE. YOU KNOW THEIR DECISION MAKING. S. WATCHIN IT'S INTERESTING HOW WAS THAT AND IN ONE OF MY LAST LIVES NOT PROTECT THE NAME OF THE COMPANY BUT WE HAVE THE ABILITY THESE OF OUR TECHNOLOGY TO ACTUALLY MONITOR WHAT OUR YOUNG. ALL OF OUR EMPLOYEES A PARTICULAR FOCUS ON THE YOUNG EMPLOYEES AND THEIR SOCIAL MEDIA ACTIVITY FOR SECURITY REASONS. AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT YOU'VE GOT THAT WE THINK OF USING THESE TOOLS FOR PURPOSES OF SORT OF HOW DO YOU REPORT SEXUAL HARASSMENT RACE DISCRIMINATION ETCETERA. WHAT WE FOUND THAT WAS A SHOCK TO WISH YOU WANNA TALK ABOUT CULTURE SOME OF THE WAYS THEY SPOKE TO EACH OTHER? OKAY SO WE HAD AND WE LITERALLY WOULD CALL IN AND SEE IT. IF YOU'RE MALE EMPLOYEE HAD SET THIS TO YOU IN THE WORKPLACE YOU'D BE AN HR. HAVE A DISCUSSION YOU REFERRED TO ANOTHER WOMAN FELLOW EMPLOYEE USE THAT THE WORD THIS WORD THAT WORD. AND SO WE SAID YOU ARE DESENSITIZING THE ORGANIZATION TO AND IT'S IT'S NOT THAT YOU DO THIS AFTER HOURS BECAUSE THAT'S NOT A DIFFERENCE EVERYONE WORKS TWENTY FOUR HOURS NOW. YOU KNOW YOU ONLINE BUT THINK ABOUT THAT THIS IS YOUR MIND SAID THIS IS WHAT WE HAVE TO CHANGE THE CULTURE AND SO YOUR POINT'S WELL TAKEN BUT I JUST DON'T WANT IT TO BE I DON'T THINK FROM HR PERSPECTIVE. THAT WE CAN COMPARTMENTALIZE PEOPLE'S LIVES LIKE THAT THE IDEA THAT YOU ALLOW. MANY OF OUR EMPLOYEES REALLY ENGAGED IN SOME TERRIBLY INAPPROPRIATE AND DIVISIVE CONVERSATION ONLINE AND THEY THINK I'M DOING THIS ON MY UP TO MY OWN TIME ON MY HOME COMPUTER DATA DOT. WILL. FAST FORWARD THEY BRING THOSE MIND SETS ENACT CULTURAL THINKING TO WORK AND THERE'S NO WAY TO COMPARTMENTALIZE IT DESPITE THE FACT THAT THEY THINK THEY CAN. AND BY THE WAY IF YOUR COLLEAGUE SAW IT AND YOUR COLLEAGUE YOU KNOW. THEY MAY TREAT YOU DIFFERENTLY AT WORK AS A RESULT OF IT SO PART OF THIS IS AND I WISH YOU KNOW WAS HERE IT IS A BROADER CONVERSATION. ABOUT WHO IS IT THAT WE BRING INTO OUR ORGANIZATION NOT JUST THEIR BEHAVIOR YOU KNOW AT WORK DURING THE FOR WHAT YOU KNOW THE FOUR WALLS OF THE BUILDING. BUT WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE AND HOW CAN WE INFLUENCE HOW THE GROW UP. AND I THINK THAT'S THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE HIGHER IT SPACE IS THIS ISN'T JUST ABOUT GOING REPORT. UP BUT YOU KNOW WHAT HAS OCCURRED TO YOU BUT LOOK AT THE MAN OR THE WOMAN IN THE MIRROR AND SAY WHO AM I HAS SWELLED TO I SEE SOME REALLY BAD THINGS ABOUT PEOPLE. TRANSGENDER ODD COMMENTS ABOUT ELDERLY THE ELDERLY PART AMAZING ON. SHE'S ALL SHE IS THAT SHE'S THAT AND I'D SO CALLED SOME OF THE EMPLOYEES AND TO SAY WE WATCH YOUR TWITTER FEED. AND AND YOU KNOW AS MUCH AS YOU TALK ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE LET ME TELL YOU YOU HAVE SOME PRETTY BAD BEHAVIOR CHRIS THE HEALTH. AND THAT HELPED PEOPLE BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND AND EMPATHIZE AND AND CHANGED OUR CULTURE ROOM AND THAT'S WHAT'S SO INTERESTING ABOUT THE PURE YOU KNOW USING THESE APPS BECAUSE. WHEN THEY SEE SOMETHING. THEY CAN PUT THAT ICON EVERYONE KNOWS WHAT THAT MEANS AND OTHERS CAN JUMP ON. AND IT'S YOU KNOW IT IS A CULTURE COMING AROUND I'M JUST REALLY QUICK ALSO FROM YOU KNOW WITH TITLE NINE I JUST WANNA SAY. HIM. WHEN I WAS YOUNG. BEING SOMEONE WHO NEVER REALLY THOUGHT ABOUT YOU KNOW THAT. I COULDN'T DO SOMETHING BECAUSE I WAS BROUGHT UP IN ON THE DAUGHTER OF IMMIGRANTS AND. IN THE SOUTH BRONX AND WENT ON TO. WIN THE CITY CHAMPIONSHIP THAT CA JUST A A CITY CHAMPIONSHIP ACROSS COUNTRY IN NEW YORK BECAUSE OF TITLE NINE. AND I KNOW THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE IN OF DAWN ON THEM IN THE SENATOR HAVE A NEGATIVE CONNOTATION ABOUT IT. AND. YOU KNOW IT'S JUST IT'S IT ALLOWS YOU TO BELIEVE YOU CAN BE ANYTHING. THAT YOU WANT TO BE AND YOU KNOW THEN YOU COME IN THE WORKPLACE AND YOU TRY AND THINGS HAPPEN THAT. YOU KNOW IT KIND OF HITS YOU LIKE WOW YOU KNOW. IT IS A. THAT A NEW AWAKENING. BUT I ONE I WAS GONNA ASK IF YOU COULD JUST TALK A LITTLE MORE ABOUT THE CONFIDENTIAL ADVOCATE. AND HOW THAT WORKS. YES. SO EVERY CAMPUS HAS A CONFIDENTIAL ADVOCATE THEIR THEIR LEGALLY PRIVILEGED THEY'RE TRAINED AS SEXUAL ASSAULT OR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE COUNSELORS AND IN FACT SENATOR JACKSON'S SPONSORED A BILL LAST YEAR THAT. INSURE THAT THEY WOULD HAVE. A LEGAL PRIVILEGE WHEN THEY'RE COUNTING ON DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AS WELL AND LAW. THANK YOU HUNT BUT I SO SO THEY'RE ALSO INDEPENDENT. THEY BASICALLY SERVE AS A RESOURCE SO IF SOMEONE GOES TO THEM THEY CAN COME IN A CONFIDENTIAL SPACE EXPLAINS THEM HERE YOUR OPTIONS THIS IS WHAT IT WOULD LOOK LIKE IF YOU REPORTED. ON THIS IS WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE IF YOU DON'T WANNA REPORT RIGHT NOW BUT MAYBE WE CAN DO SOMETHING ELSE FOR YOU. I THINK PEOPLE HAVE A FEAR OF COMING FORWARD BECAUSE THEY THINK IT'S GONNA START. I TRAIN LEAVING THE STATION THAT THEY WON'T BE ABLE TO CONTROL AND SO THE MORE YOU CAN MAKE SOMEONE FEEL THAT THEY'RE IN CONTROL. OF THAT PROCESS THE MORE LIKELY THEY ARE TO COME FORWARD. SO WE FOUND THOSE CONFIDENTIAL ADVOCATES I THINK OUR STUDENTS WOULD CERTAINLY SAY THAT'S BEEN THE MOST IMPORTANT AN OVATION WE'VE. WE'VE PUT ON THE CAMPUS. ALICE COMMENT THAT WE'VE. HOTLINE THAT WE ARE CONTRACTING WITH I'M WILL PROVIDE A LOT OF THE SERVICES TO. PEOPLE WHO COME IN CONTACT WITH US SENATOR LEYVA. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. ACTUALLY PERFECT TIMING. MISSILE ALL DAY I HAD A FOLLOWUP QUESTION ONE WAS ABOUT THE CONFIDENTIAL ADVOCATE AND THEN YOU ALSO MENTIONED THAT YOU HAD A NON BOATS PERSON ONE WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE IN. THE THE ROLE OF THE ON BUT PERSON VERSUS THE CONFIDENTIAL ADVOCATE. THANK YOU FOR ASKING SO THE CONFERENCE ADVOCATE AS I MENTIONED IS IS LEGALLY PRIVILEGED AND. TYPICALLY I THINK HAS BEEN THOUGHT OF MORE IN THE SEXUAL ASSAULT. SPACE ON AND PROBABLY MORE STUDENT FOCUSED ALTHOUGH THEY DO AT THIS POINT SERVE OUR ENTIRE COMMUNITY THE ARM BUDS. WOULD BE NOT CERTAINLY THEY WOULD HAVE ANY KIND OF LEGAL PRIVILEGE BUT THEY ARE CONFIDENTIAL THE SENSE THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TO REPORT. ON MANY OF OUR EMPLOYEES ARE WHAT WE CALL RESPONSIBLE EMPLOYEES WHICH MEANS THAT IF THEY BECOME AWARE OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT THEY NEED TO REPORT IT. TO TITLE NINE I'M ENTITLED LINE DECIDES WORKING WITH THAT YOU KNOW VICTIMS WHAT TO DO FROM THERE. ON SO BUT THE ON WHAT'S DO NOT HAVE THAT REPORTING OBLIGATION SO THERE'S STILL A CONFIDENTIAL SPACE THAT CAN TRY TO WORK WITH THE PERSON TO COME UP WITH ALTERNATIVES AND RESOLUTIONS ON. EXPLAIN OPTIONS SORT OF HELP THEM MAKE DECISIONS AND DID YOU SEE THAT THE CONFIDENTIAL ADVOCATE YOU THOUGHT IT WAS ONE OF THE BEST THINGS THAT YOU HAD INSTITUTED. HOW LONG AGO DID THAT START ON THE CAMPUSES? I THINK SOME CAMPUSES HAD THESE ADVOCATES FOR YEARS BUT IT WAS IN EARLY TWENTY FIFTEEN THAT THE PRESIDENT ENSURE THAT EVERY CAMPUS HAD THAT SORT OF INDEPENDENT FULLY CONFIDENTIAL ADVOCATE. THAT'S GREAT THAT'S THAT'S VERY HELPFUL BECAUSE WERE STRUGGLING WITH HOW DO WE MAKE AND CREATE A SAFE ENVIRONMENT FOR EMPLOYEES TO COME FORWARD. AND REPORT WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO THEM RIGHT. SO I THINK COUNTY NOT CONFIDENTIAL FIRST STOP IS CRITICAL I WOULD AGREE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND MISTER TAYLOR ó YOUR COMMENT ABOUT WE NEED COURAGEOUS HR I WOULD SAY WE NEED COURAGEOUS PEOPLE IN THIS THING THAT WE CALL LIFE. AND IT GOES BACK TO THE COMMENT THAT SOMEONE MADE ABOUT HOW TO BE A COULD BYSTANDER. IT'S KINDA LIKE BEING A BULLY YOU TELL YOUR CHILDREN NOT TO BE A BULLY BUT ONE OF THE THINGS WE TOLD OUR CHILDREN AS IT'S EVEN WORSE IF YOU SEE SOMEONE BEING BULLIED AND YOU DON'T STEP IN. AND I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD ALL EVERY SINGLE ONE OF US BE JUST ALWAYS THINK ABOUT HOW CAN I HELP MAKE THE SITUATION BETTER. AND I THINK ALL OF YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATIONS VERY HELPFUL VERY ENLIGHTENING THINK THEY COMMAND CHAIR. THANK YOU SENATOR MORLOCK. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. PROFESSOR DAN HARD I'M BEGINNING TO FEEL THAT CULTURE IS MULTI LAYERED. INTERPERSONAL CULTURE CORPORATE CULTURE INNOVATION CULTURE BUSINESS CULTURE. I EN UN VOTE. THE GOLD STANDARD THAT PETER. DRUCKER I DOES YOU HAVE A. A BOOK ON OR DIZZY HAVE A CHAPTER ON. CULTURE. I COULD FIND ONE FOR YOU HE. IN HIS MOST INFLUENTIAL BOOK WAS WRITTEN IN NINETEEN FIFTY FOUR. I DON'T.

PROBABLY PUMP SORRY AND AND AND HE WROTE A BOOK. ABOUT CORPORATE CULTURE AND I LISTEN TO HIM SPEAK AND I YOU KNOW YOU WOULD YOU TALK ABOUT DUES USING UP POSITIVE. APPROACH. I TOLD YOU SEE. ROAD DELIVERING HAPPINESS. A PATH TO PROFITS PASSION AND PURPOSE. AND IT'S DYNAMIC. ON. HOWEVER BUDDY IN THE COMPANY TREATS CUSTOMERS AND. INDIVIDUALS AND IMPACT. THEY HAVE A POLICY IF YOU DON'T LIKE THE CULTURE AT ZAPPOS AFTER YOU BEEN THERE FOR SIX MONTHS THEY GIVE YOU A BIG BONUS TO LEAVE. THAT'S AND SO I'M JUST WONDERING IF. THAT WOULD BE A GOOD BOOK TO SHARE IT WITH MY COLLEAGUES. OR OF WERE BE SHOULD COME IN SPEAKER IF THERE'S A VIDEO NOW IF YOU COULD GET HIM TO COME AND SPEAK AT THE MARVELOUS THE OTHER ARM. FOUND GREAT EXAMPLE OF POSITIVE ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE SOUTHWEST AIRLINES. THE. PERSON IS PROBABLY BEST KNOWN IN THIS FIELD IS A PROFESSOR PRESIDENT ACKER SHINE. IT'S S. C. H. E. AYE AND. HAS WRITTEN A LOT ABOUT. CULTURE AND LAYERS OF CULTURE. IT ALSO. IT SOME OF THIS CONVERSATION YOU'RE CORRECT. POLITICAL CULTURE AND ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE. INTERSECT. WE WE ALL BRING LAYERS OF CULTURE TO WORK. AND SO. OUR NATIONAL CULTURE ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE A POLITICAL CULTURE. ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE SUBCULTURES. ALL OVERLAP IN AND THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS IT'S SO COMPLEX TO CHANGE. IS THAT WE'RE ALL BRINGING IN DIFFERENT EXPERIENCES AND HISTORIES AND. AND AND NORMS ABOUT BEHAVIOR. BUT THERE HAS BEEN A LOT WRITTEN ABOUT THIS I WOULD LOOK AT ECHO SHINE. I WOULD LOOK AT ZAPPOS I WOULD LOOK AT SOUTHWEST AIRLINES. BUT THERE'S A LOT RIGHT NOW. A LOT OF THE WRITING ON ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE IS ABOUT CREATING A CULTURE OF INNOVATION AND RESILIENCE. AND WHAT YOU WANT IS IS. ITS ONE THING TO HAVE A STRONG CULTURE IT'S VERY GOOD TO HAVE A STRONG CULTURE IN LESS. ONE OF THE TENETS OF THAT CULTURE IS TO NOT CHANGE. AND SO WHAT YOU WANT IT WHAT YOU WANT IS YOU WANT A RESILIENT FLEXIBLE CULTURE. AND THE WAY THAT YOU GET A RESILIENT FLEXIBLE CULTURE THAT ADAPTS TO THE ITS EXTERNAL FORCES. IS BY HAVING A CULTURE THAT VALUES TRUST AND STABILITY AND SAFETY. ALL OF THE THINGS THAT YOU'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT TODAY. CULTURE IS NOT JUST SOME. YOU KNOW KUN BY ALLAH YOU KNOW. TOUCHY FEELY THING IS THE THING THAT DRIVES. ORGANIZATIONAL SUCCESS AND PROFITABILITY IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND IT'S WHAT A DRIVES ORGANIZATIONAL SUCCESS AND PUBLIC SECTOR NONPROFIT. I SAW BODY. YOU HAVE COUNSELING ON CAMPUS. WHAT YOU DO TO HELP OUT VICTIMS? BUT IT MYSELF FOR US AS ONE OF THE COUNSELORS DEREK YOU WHAT WHAT WHAT IS WHAT IS YOUR ORGANIZATION DOING TO HELP PICK. DO YOU REFER THEM TO SOMEONE ARE DO YOU HAVE SOME INTERNAL. AT THE COUNTY IF WE HAD A. A MAJOR A VET. YOU BRING AND COUNSELORS MOVES. RIGHT AND HELP ME PICK RECOUNTS WRITER WHATEVER. WHAT WOULD WE HAVE TO HELP SOMEONE WHO SAYS HEY I I'VE BEEN ARRESTED RIGHT? IT'S IMPACTING IS. TAYLOR SAID SO HOW DO WE. OR ARE WE REQUIRED. TO HELP OUT. IN SOME WAY DO IT WITH THERE SHOULD BE SOME. MAYBE SOME. BUDGET ITEM THAT IS WE HAVE SOMEHOW RESTORED HIS MERCY IS SO DRAMATIC RIGHT. WE ARE REQUIRED TO DO THAT UNDER TITLE NINE AND. NOW WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE IS IS VERY CHALLENGING BUT I FEEL ON SOME OF THE LUCKY HUNT THAT THAT WE DON'T HAVE A CHOICE. ON THAT WE DO HAVE TO DO AND I AND I HAVE THOUGHT TO MYSELF THAT STUDENTS ON IS. HORRIBLE AS IT IS TO EXPERIENCE SEXUAL HARASSMENT OR SEXUAL VIOLENCE I DO THINK ON. THE UC HAS. AS I'M SURE MANY COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES YOU HAVE SO MANY SUPPORT SYSTEMS IN PLACE FOR IT FOR THOSE. FOLKS WHO DO SO ON YOU KNOW WE WE HAVE OUR COUNSELORS WE HAVE STUDENT COUNSELING CENTERS WE HAVE EMPLOYEE ASSISTANCE AND COUNSELING CENTERS. WE HAVE A TITLE MIND OFFICE WITH LEGAL MANDATES AND A STRONG POLICY AND WE ARE REQUIRED TO IF WE FIND THE PERSON AS EXPERIENCE SEXUAL HARASSMENT. UP WERE REQUIRED TO REMEDY THAT. WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE IN A GIVEN CASES IS COMPLICATED BUT WE DO WORK WITH HR OR ACADEMIC COUNSELING OR WHOEVER WE NEED TO WORK WITH? TRY AND MAKE SURE THAT THEIR EDUCATIONAL OR ACADEMIC PROGRESS IS. RESUMED AND MAINTAINED. IT'S. VERY CHALLENGING. WE'RE COMMITTED TO IT THANK YOU TAYLOR ASKED LAST QUESTION. SUMMING I USED TO DO I STILL DO. WAS HAVE EXIT INTERVIEWS IT WAS YOUR LAST WEEK I'D SAY COMMANDED. AND I SAID I'M NOT TAKEN NOTES AT THIS IS FREE FOR ALL YOU DID AND TELL ME. WHAT I NEED TO KNOW WHAT DO I NEED TO KNOW IS THE MANAGER OF THIS DEPARTMENT WHAT WHAT SHOULD I CHANGE? AND IT WOULD USUALLY BE LIKE. WATCHLIST DRESS CASUAL ONCE IN AWHILE IT'S WERE. WHY CAN'T WE HAVE A RADIO AT OUR DESK YOU'RE YOU KNOW AS I NEVER HAD SOMEONE SAY SO AND SO IS DOING THIS I'M NEVER AND NEVER HAD? YOU GOTTA YOU GOTTA TAKE CARE OF SILENCE HOPE. BUT TOM. I'M JUST WONDERING ABOUT THE EFFICACY OF AFFECTION ABUSES AT SOMETHING YOU ADVOCATE. WHAT'S INTERESTING NOT ONLY DO WE ADVOCATE THE USE OF OF. EXIT SURVEYS BUT AN EXIT INTERVIEWS SO AND IN SOME OF THE BEST PRACTICES ISSUE HAPPENED WHEN THE PERSON IS EXITING THEIR LAST DAY. YOU HAVE A ONE ON ONE CONVERSATION WITH THEM TO SAY TELL ME ABOUT YOUR EXPERIENCE HERE ONE OF THE BEST PRACTICES IS YOU ALSO READ OFF THE VALUES THE ORGANIZATION AND SAY. HOW DID WE RATE? WILL YOUR EXPERIENCE WHILE HERE DID WE LIVE THOSE VALUES IT HELPS YOU FIGURE OUT WHAT IT REALLY MEANS. BUT ONE OF THE THAT THE BEST INVENTIONS INTERVENTIONS THAT I'VE SEEN AS OF LATE. IS THEN ABOUT A MONTH LATER. YOU HAVE AN INDEPENDENT PARTY CALLED THE EMPLOYEE TO SAY NOW YOU'VE STEPPED AWAY FROM. YOU'RE DONE. LET ME ASK YOU ANOTHER SERIES OF. AND YOU DELVE A LITTLE BIT DEEPER BECAUSE THERE ARE LIMITATIONS ULTIMATELY YOU DON'T WANNA SAY ANYTHING TOO BADLY ABOUT YOUR ORGANIZATION BECAUSE YOU MAY NEED THAT SAME ORGANIZATION TO GIVE YOU A REFERENCE IN THE FUTURE RIGHT EVEN IF YOU LEAVE THERE WITH THE JOB IT MIGHT BE YOUR NEXT. JOB THAT YOU NEED AT THE SECOND OR THIRD JOB SO WHAT WE FOUND IS USING AN INDEPENDENT ORGANIZATION TO BAN CALL ABOUT A MONTHLATER SO THEY'VE STEPPED AWAY FROM IT. ESPECIALLY PEOPLE LEFT UNDER SITUATIONS WITH EXPERIENCED A CRISIS THEY'RE TOO CLOSE TO IT TO REALLY DEAL WITH IT. GIVEN A MONTH LATER HAVE SOMEONE CALL THEM INDEPENDENTLY AND IT'S BEEN A GREAT PRACTICE FOR US TO LEARN. A EXACTLY WHAT'S GOING ON IN OUR SHOP. THANK YOU RICHARD TAYLOR THANK YOU. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER RADIUS. THANK YOU. I REALLY DO APPRECIATE THAT TODAY'S HEARING WAS CENTERED ON CULTURE AND THE NEED TO RECOGNIZE THAT THAT'S SUCH AN IMPORTANT. IDEA THAT WE REALLY HAVE TO GET A HANDLE ON. LIFE RECEIVED ALL OF YOUR COMMENTS REGARDING CULTURE BECAUSE THAT'S THE BEGINNING. OF WHAT WE'RE GOING TO CHANGE IN THE FUTURE. ONE OF THE COMMENTS THAT WAS MADE HAD TO DO WITH. YOU WANT TO BE SURE. TO TAILOR THAT YOU HAVE COURAGEOUS HR PEOPLE. AND THE ONE THING THAT CAME TO MIND IS. THE NEED TO EMPOWER OUR AGE ARE REPRESENTATIVES AS WELL. IF. THEY. THE CULTURE HAS BEEN SUCH THAT THEY ARE TOLD WHAT THEY HAVE TO DO THEN WERE NOT EMPOWERING THEM. IS THAT ANOTHER PART OF THE CULTURE THAT NEEDS TO BE CHANGED AND HOW DO WE CHANGE THAT. WELL THERE'S A QUICK AND IT STARTS FROM THE TOP IN THAT RESPECT. THE HR LEADERS HAVE TO BELIEVE THAT WHEN I GO OUT THERE AND I'M BEING OBJECTIVE AND HONEST AND I KEEP YOU FEEDBACK ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON IN OUR UP AN ORGANIZATION THAT YOU WILL DO SOMETHING WITH THAT AND IF YOU THAT YOU WILL AT LEAST NOT HOLD ME ULTIMATELY RESPONSIBLE I'M JUST THE MESSENGER IF YOU WILL. AND SO ON YOU'RE TO STEP VERSION IN NATURE PERSON WHO'S COMFORTABLE ENOUGH AND COURAGEOUS ENOUGH TO DO IT BUT THEN THE ORGANIZATION AGAIN CANNOT IMMEDIATELY GIVE NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES TO HIM OR HER. GOES BACK TO THE STUDIO ADDRESS OF THE ORGANIZATION THAT THIS THEY TALK ABOUT IT BUT THEY DON'T MEAN IT SO THAT SHORT ANSWER IS IT REQUIRES NOT ONLY FINDING THE RIGHT AGE A PERSON BUT CREATING A CULTURE AND DEPARTMENT OF PEOPLE. BUT ALSO A CULTURE WITH THE HR FOLKS CAN REALLY DO WHAT THEY DO BEST AND THAT IS REALLY SIGNAL TO YOU WHAT'S HAPPENING IN YOUR. ONE OF THE COMMENTS THAT WAS MADE HAS TO DO WITH HOLDING PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE. AND I KNOW THERE'S A COMMENT ABOUT THE TENURE PROFESSOR VERSUS SOMEONE. TENURED. WELL I THINK ALONG THE SAME LINES WE HAVE LEGISLATORS WHO ARE. ELECTED VERSES IT COULD BE A SUPERVISOR EMPLOYEES. CLEARLY THINGS ARE DIFFERENT. BECAUSE YOU HAVE LEGISLATORS JUST AS OUR CHAIRWOMAN HAS OFTEN SAID. THEY ARE NOT EMPLOYEES IN THE THE SAME SENSE OF THAT. ANY OTHER EMPLOYEE WOULD BE CLASSIFIED. SO HOW DO YOU FIGURE OUT HOW YOU. HOLD SOMEBODY ACCOUNTABLE. WHO WAS A LEGISLATOR VERSUS HOW YOU HOLD SOMEBODY ACCOUNTABLE WHO IS A? YET EITHER SUPERVISOR OR AN EMPLOYEE. THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION AND I AND I. WANT TO REMEMBER THAT IN BOTH INSTANCES THERE ARE GOOD REASONS WHY HEY. A LEGISLATOR OR A TENURED PROFESSOR CAN'T BE TERMINATED LIKE THAT UP FOR TIP FOR POLITICAL PROTECTION RIGHT IN ACADEMIC FREEDOM SO IT SO THERE ARE GOOD REASONS FOR IT. I THINK IT'S BEEN REALLY IMPORTANT. AGAIN TO START TO TIE. TIED TO THE MISSION. RIGHT SO TO ENSURE THAT WE THAT WOULD TO START TALKING TO OUR FACULTY ABOUT WHY WERE HERE WHY THEY'RE WHAT THEIR PURPOSE AT BEING YOU THAT YOU SEE IS. AND IT'S TO EDUCATE AND WHEN. WHEN THEY'VE SEEN THESE PARTICULAR THESE HIGHER PROFILE MATTERS REALLY DESTROYED DEPARTMENTS. DISTRACT THEM FROM THEIR SMALLER SHIP WOULD BE AN UNDERSTATEMENT. REALLY DAMAGE THE INSTITUTION THAT THEY'VE LOVED AND THE DEPARTMENTS THAT THEY'VE LOVED. I THINK THEY'VE BEEN MUCH MORE WILLING TO. HOLD EACH OTHER ACCOUNTABLE AND THAT REPUTATION THAT REPUTATIONAL ACCOUNTABILITY IS QUITE. QUITE POWERFUL IN IN CERTAINLY IN IN YOUR HER. PROFESSION BUT ALSO IN THE IN THE ACADEMIC PROFESSION ON AND ON SOME LEVEL. FACULTY MEMBERS FOUND RESPONSIBLE FOR SEXUAL HARASSMENT. PAYS A PRICE. PROBABLY MUCH GREATER THAN A CORPORATE EMPLOYEE BECAUSE IT'S IT'S OUT THERE. AND. YOU KNOW. IT'S PUBLIC INFORMATION AND AND NO YOU KNOW A UNIVERSITY CAN BE VERY HESITANT TO TAKE ON THAT FACULTY MEMBER OR EVEN PUBLISH THEIR WORK. IF THEIR REPUTATIONS BEEN DAMAGED IN THAT WAY. ANOTHER COMMENT THAT WAS MADE HOW TO DO WITH SWIFT ACTION. WHEN A REPORT IS RECEIVED. IN ORDER TO TO CHANGE BEHAVIOR THEIR HOUSE TO BE SWIFT ACTION SALUTE YOU KNOW THAT. THE THE. THE DISCIPLINE OR THE REACTION ISN'T HE IN RESPONSE TO WHAT WAS REPORTED. HOW DO WE BALANCE THAT WITH DUE PROCESS? THERE WAS A PAUSE HOME. THAT'S THE CHALLENGE A. SWIFT BUT DELIBERATE. IS PERHAPS THE WAY THAT WE TRY TO USE THOSE TERMS IN HASTE WILL MAKE WASTE AND OWN WE ARE DEALING WITH PEOPLE'S LIVES ON BOTH SIDES. BUT THIS THE SITUATION AND SO THERE'S A PROCESS THAT SAYS WE WANT TO MOVE ACROSS BUT I GIVE YOU A CLASSIC EXAMPLE ALL OF US IN THE FUTURE WORLD. FRANKLY AND I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE A NON A CHAU WORLD THAT WITH THE MATT LAUER SITUATION. APPARENTLY IF YOU BELIEVE WHAT WAS SAID. THE THE REPORT CAME TO THEM FOR THE FIRST TIME IN TWENTY YEARS ON A MONDAY AND THEN. S. FIRED ON TUESDAY. NO ONE THOUGHT THAT A THAT WAS OVERLY SWIFT THAT'S THE POINT EVEN IF THE END RESULT WAS WHAT IT WAS AND WE BELIEVE THAT WAS THE RIGHT RESULT. THE IDEA THAT YOU COULD CONDUCT IN THE SEMBLANCE OF A REAL INVESTIGATION AS AN HR PROFESSIONAL IN LESS INTO A POOR OURS AND MAKE A DECISION. YOU CAN MAKE A DECISION TO SUSPEND WHICH IS A DIFFERENT DECISION THAN A FULL OUT TERMINATION DECISION BECAUSE EVERYONE'S LOOKING THEY'RE THINKING ABOUT MY GOSH. AND I'M GONNA GO SO FAR AS YOU YOU LIKE IN A LITTLE BIT TO WHAT YOU SEE IN THE. CRIMINAL JUSTICE WORLD EVEN WHEN WE SEE SOMEONE COMMIT A CRIME IT'S ON VIDEO BUBBA BLAH WE STILL HAVE A PROCESS BY WHICH WE DETERMINE WHETHER WHAT IF THAT PERSON WAS WHAT WE REALLY SAW WHAT WE SAW. AND WHAT ARE THE MITIGATING FOR. CIRCUMSTANCES IMPACTORS AND THEN WE MAKE THE RIGHT LEVEL OF OF OF BOB. PUNISHMENT OR DISCIPLINE. YOU HAVE I THINK THAT IS A PERFECT WAY FOR SAID THINK ABOUT SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND OTHER FORMS WORKPLACE HARASSMENT BUT THIS NOTION THAT WE NEED TO LEARN ONE DAY AND WITHIN A DATA TO OUR WEEK. SORT IT AND MAKE A DECISION ABOUT SOMEONE'S LIFE TO PUT IT TAKES TIME TO PROPERLY FOR EXAMPLE INTERVIEW WITNESSES. IT TAKES TIME TO PROPERLY VET THE CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER SEPARATE FACT FROM FICTION. AND YOU KNOW AS A PRACTICING LAWYER WHO DID SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND OTHER FORMS OF HARASSMENT THOSE INVESTIGATIONS FOR YEARS. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE MAGIC PERIOD AS ITS SHOULDN'T TAKE TWO YEARS TO DO IT BUT I AM ABSOLUTELY CONVINCED THAT IS NOT A WEEK EITHER. WOULD YOU SAY THAT PART OF THAT HAS TO DO WITH THE RELATIONSHIP. TWEEN A SUPERVISOR. ASSUMING THAT IT'S AN EMPLOYEE. RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN A SUPERVISOR IN THE EMPLOYEE THE EMPLOYEE HAS NOW WHEN THAT'S NOT A GOOD EXAMPLE. LET'S GO TO LEGISLATORS. LET'S GO TO SECTOR WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT YES IF IF YOU HAVE A LEGISLATOR WHO HAS. BEEN ACCUSED. IF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE LEGISLATOR AND THAT LEGISLATORS SUPERVISOR. IS A GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH A SUPERVISOR SAYS WE HEAR THE SPEAKER. THIS IS A SITUATION I THINK THIS IS WHERE YOU SHOULD GO WHETHER IT'S TOO TO RESIGN OR WHATEVER IS THAT RELATIONSHIP. IMPORTANT IN THIS SORT OF A. YEAH SHE WAS SO IT'S FUNDAMENTALLY FOUNDED IN TRUST. AND AND THE ORG AND WE TALKED EARLIER ABOUT SOME OF THE DISTINCTION I THINK YOU HAVE TWO OPTIONS HERE ONE OF WHICH IS NOT RELAPSE AND ONE IS EXPULSION AND ONE A SUSPENSION. I THINK AS A PRACTICAL MATTER YOU ALL CAN BOAT TO SEE SPEND DON'T ONE OF YOUR COLLEAGUES WHO YOU COLLECTIVELY DETERMINE. HAS ENGAGED IN THE QUESTIONABLE BEHAVIOR AND POTENTIALLY ILLEGAL BEHAVIOR UP TO AND INCLUDING SEXUAL ASSAULT. SO YOU CAN SUSPEND THEM I DON'T KNOW OVER TIME I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HISTORY IS IN CALIFORNIA BUT IF YOU'VE EVER USED THE EXPULSION. OPTION AND THAT AGAIN IS WHEN YOU GO BACK TWO PEOPLE JUDGING YOU BY WHAT YOU DO AND NOT WHAT YOU SAY. I THINK SUSPENSION IS INTERESTING TEMPORARILY AND I KNOW THERE ARE TONS OF HURDLES AND I DIDN'T MEAN TO MISS CHARACTERIZE YOUR COMMENTS ABOUT. IT'S JUST THAT. IF YOU HAVE EXPOSURE AS AN OPTION. AND YOU'VE NEVER USED IT. THEN IS IT REALLY AN OPTION AND OUR PEOPLE TO BELIEVE THAT YOU'RE SERIOUS ABOUT IT IF YOU'VE NEVER USED IT. IT'S THE SAME IT'S A THAT'S THE POINT I'M TRYING TO MAKE IS THAT YES YOU'RE DIFFERENT THAN IF I WERE EVERY COMPANY HAVE GONE TO WORK WITH THE MY LIFE IS SAYS WE'RE UNIQUE. EVERYTHING SHOOTING. YOU KNOW THERE ARE NO TWO ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE THE SAME BUT IF WE SAY ZERO TOLERANCE. THEN WE CAN START PUTTING AND DIFFERENTIATED SORT OF STANDARDS IF SOMEONE ENGAGES IN BEHAVIOR THAT BRINGS HARM TO PEOPLE THEN YOUR HR FUNCTION U. S. LEADERS HAVE TO TAKE ACTION. APPROPRIATELY SWIFT. MY LOOK COULD I JUST ADD TO THEM IN IN TALKING ABOUT ACCOUNTABILITY. IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT YOU DON'T WANNA JUST SHINE THE LIGHT. ON. COMPLAINTS INVESTIGATIONS YOU ALSO WANT TO HOLD PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE FOR DOING THE RIGHT THING. AND SO YOU WANT THE CONVERSATION NOT JUST TO BE ABOUT. WHAT HAS GONE WRONG BUT HIGHLIGHTING EXAMPLES WHERE PEOPLE CAN BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR DOING THE RIGHT THING? AND. THAT WAY IT ITS ITS THAT'S MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE IN TERMS OF CHANGING PEOPLE'S BEHAVIOR. THAN TALKING ABOUT WELL THERE WAS THIS INVESTIGATION THAT THE RUMOR MILL STARTS YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED WAS ENOUGH DONE. I'M TO ALSO TALK ABOUT WHAT WENT RIGHT. IN MY LAST QUESTION MADAM CHAIR. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT. REPORTING. TALKING ABOUT THE LIFE OF A VICTIM. AT WHAT POINT DO WE ALLOW THE VICTIM. TO DIRECT REPORTING. FOR THAT VICTIM TO BE THE ONE WHO DECIDES WHAT IS REPORTED WHEN IT IS REPORTED AND THE DETAILS OF THAT REPORT TO PROTECT. HER AND I RECOGNIZE THAT MEN SOMETIMES OF THE VICTIMS BUT I THINK STATISTICS ARE CLEAR THAT WE HAVE OVER EIGHTY PERCENT. SOME STATISTICS STATISTICS TAKE US UP TO NINETY PERCENT. OF THE VICTIMS ARE WOMEN AND THAT'S WHY I THINK THE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE WOMEN VICTIMS SO HOW IS IT THAT WE PROTECT THE VICTIMS AND ALLOW THAT VICTIM. TO BE THE ONE TO DIRECT REPORTING OF THE CRIME OR THE HARASSMENT AGAINST. HER OR HIM. WIPING THAT'S WHY IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT HAVE SORT OF A CONFIDENTIAL SPACE WHERE THEY CAN GO TO GET INFORMATION AND MAKE CHOICES ON AT A CERTAIN POINT. YOU KNOW. IT'S HARD BECAUSE THEY. IF THE INSTITUTION KNOWS. WE COULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR NOT DOING SOMETHING ABOUT IT RIGHT SO YOU YOU CAN'T HAVE A VICTIM COME IN. YOU YOU YOU CAN'T GATHER. IN OVER TEN REPORTS AGAINST A CERTAIN PERSON AND THEN SAY WELL I'M STILL JUST GONNA LET EACH VICTIM DECIDE. HOW THIS GOES BECAUSE AT A CERTAIN POINT THE INSTITUTION HAS TO SAY NO? WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING BUT FOR THE MOST PART I THINK YOU DO WANT TO TRY AND. RESPECT THAT VICTIMS ON WISHES. CERTAINLY WHILE BALANCING SAFETY SO I THINK. IF SOMEONE KNOWS THAT IF THEY DID COME FORWARD IT'S NOT IT'S NOT AUTOMATICALLY GOING TO THE NUCLEAR REACTION. THAT THERE COULD BE SMALLER THINGS IF IT'S IF VOTE IF SOMEONE COME FORUMS LIKE THIS IS MAKING ME UNCOMFORTABLE. I DON'T WANT A FULL. A FULL BLOWN INVESTIGATION FINING I'D LIKE MY CUBICLE MOVED. WE TRY TO DO THAT. AND THEN THINK ABOUT WHAT IF ANYTHING ELSE WE CAN AND SHOULD DO WHILE RESPECTING THAT PERSON'S WISHES. YOU THANK YOU BEFORE I GO TO MISTER DALLI I JUST WANT TO MAKE A COMMENT WHICH IS THAT OF EXPULSION HASN'T BEEN USED. THE OP THE OTHER OPTION IS NOT THAT IT'S BECAUSE WE'RE NOT SERIOUS IT'S ALSO MAYBE IT'S JUST NOT THE RIGHT TOOL. YOU KNOW SO AND WE NEED TO BE OPEN TO THAT AS WELL. IT MAY BE THAT IT MAY NEVER BE USED BECAUSE IT'S JUST NOT THE RIGHT INSTRUMENT. A MISTER DALI. THANK YOU ARE CHAIR. SO YOU KNOW WE ARE. A STATE OF LAWS AND WE HAVE LAWS THAT ARE ON THE BOOKS RIGHT NOW AND WE ARE LAWMAKERS. AND AT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I FIND. INTERESTING ABOUT NOT COMING TO THE LEGISLATURE. AFTER SERVING IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT FOR A LONG TIME IT HAPPENED TO DEAL WITH THE LAWS THAT. THAT THIS. THESE BODIES PASS. I CAME TO THE LEGISLATURE AND WHEN I CAME AS AS A LEGISLATOR. I HIRED MY STAFF AND AND I HAVE. MY DISTRICT OFFICES AND SO I HAD AN EMPLOYEE. WHO I WAS TRYING TO? EDUCATE ON HOW I WANTED. THINGS DONE AND I'M SO ANYWAY IT DIDN'T WORK OUT OUR OUR RELATIONSHIP DIDN'T WORK OUT I I'M A I'M A GOOD PLAYER. FOR MY BOOK HOME VISIT I'M A FARMER I HAVE EMPLOYEES TO SO I HAVE TO ABIDE BY. THE LABOR LAWS THAT DID. ARE THE LAWS OF CALIFORNIA. AND THERE ARE YOUKNOW WORKERS HAVE TONS OF RIGHTS AND THERE'S LOTS OF REASONS FOR ALL THESE LAWS AND AND I UNDERSTAND ALL THAT. A BUT WHEN I CAME THE LEGISLATURE. AFTER COME A LOCAL GOVERNMENT AYE AYE AYE. DID ALL THE SAME THINGS I DID AT THE LOCAL LEVEL WHICH WAS. I YOU KNOW. ENCOURAGE THE PERSON GAVE HIM IN WRITING ALL THESE THINGS THAT I NEEDED TO DO TO. TRY TO IMPROVE THE THE ABILITY FOR THEM TO WORK AND IT DIDN'T WORK OUT SO LET HAD LET THAT PERSON GO SIGHT I TURNED INTO. THE PAPERWORK TO OUR. THE RULES COMMITTEE AND SAID I'M NOT LET THIS PERSON'S GOING TO SETTLE MISTER AL YOU KNOW YOU DON'T. IT'S DIFFERENT HERE AT THE STATE LEVEL YOU DON'T YOU DON'T HAVE. TO BUILD A CASE YOU THEIR OUT WILL EMPLOYEES. AND SOMETHING I FOUND VERY FRUSTRATING AS A. PERSON HAS TO ABIDE BY THE LAWS LAS IN EMPLOYMENT AND MY HOME BUSINESS THAT YOU KNOW THAT LEGISLATURE HAS EXEMPTED THEMSELVES FROM THE LAWS THEY PASS. SO LET ME GIVE AN EXAMPLE WE ARE ABLE TO WORK. A TWENTY HOUR DAY HERE WITHOUT GIVING R. PLAYS A BREAK. NOW I'M NOT ABLE TO DO THAT AT HOME BECAUSE I'M IN VIOLATION OF LABOR LAWS. THAT WE PASS AND SO. YOU KNOW I OFTEN SAY TO MY COLLEAGUES THAT IF YOU HAD TO LIVE BY THE LAWS YOU PASS YOU WOULDN'T PASS SOME OF THOSE LAWS BECAUSE THEY'RE VERY DIFFICULT TO LIVE BY. BUT WE'VE EXEMPTED OURSELVES AND SO WE'RE WE HAVE A CULTURE HERE THAT SAYS WE ARE ABOVE THE LAW BECAUSE WE DON'T EVEN ABIDE BY THE OWN LAWS THAT WE PASS. AND WE DON'T CHEAT OUR EMPLOYEES THE SAME AS I HAVE TO TREAT MY EMPLOYEES AT HOME. AND I THINK GOT CULTURE AS WE TALK ABOUT THIS CULTURE THERE'S A CULTURE THAT WERE BETTER THAN EVEN OUR OWN LAWS THAT WE HAVE TO ABIDE BY OUR LAWS AND IN THAT SETS IT. THE PARADIGM AND IN PLACE SO YOU KNOW FOR GOING FORWARD. WE ARE EVERYTHING I'VE BEEN HER THIS. THE BODY IS GRAPPLING WITH WHAT IS THE CULTURE OF THIS LEGISLATIVE BODY AGAIN IT LOOKS LIKE IN THE FUTURE FOR CALIFORNIA. IN YOUR OPINION DO YOU THINK THAT WE SHOULD ABIDE BY THE LAWS THAT WE PASS. SO THAT THERE'S A BASE. FOR. THE EMPLOYEE TO KNOW THAT HEY I AT LEAST I HAVE THESE LAWS ON MY SIDE TO START WITH. BECAUSE RIGHT NOW IF YOU WORK FOR THE STATE LEGISLATURE. WE HAVE EXEMPT OURSELVES IN THE LOS THE LABOR LAWS THAT WE'VE PAST IS STATE. YOU DON'T ALWAYS HAVE TO ANSWER THE QUESTIONS IF YOU DON'T. BOB ABOUT THE STATE'S OPTIC ASIDE AND. NO I I I I DO THINK THAT AS I'VE SAID A COUPLE OF TIMES I THINK. PEOPLE JUDGE ABOUT WHAT YOU DO AND NOT NECESSARILY WHAT YOU SAY AND THAT IS THE STANDARD AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THERE IS A LITTLE BIT OF A DISCONNECT. IT WITH IS THAT YOU HAVE THIS LAW THAT APPLIES HERE NOT ENOUGH THIS BUT TO BE FAIR THERE ARE DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES FOR DIFFERENT. YOU KNOW DIFFERENT RULES FOR DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES SO FRANKLY FROM MY PERSPECTIVE WHAT I WOULD DO. IS TO THE EXTENT THERE IS A DIFFERENCE IF THERE IS A LEGITIMATE REASON FOR TREATING FOR EXEMPTING YOU FROM A PARTICULAR LAW THEN YOU SHOULD GO TO GREAT LENGTHS. EXPLAIN WHY BECAUSE IF THERE IS IF IT'S PURELY BECAUSE WE DO THINK WE ARE ABOVE THE LAW THEN THAT'S A PROBLEM YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT AND IT BLEEDS INTO EVERYTHING ELSE AND THAT'S WHY. YOU WILL HAVE SOME OF THE PROBLEMS THAT YOU HAVE IN WORKPLACE HARASSMENT GENERALLY BUT IF THERE IS A REALLY COMPELLING REASON FOR WHY THERE ARE REASONS WHY YOUR RULES THAT AND THEN OTHER RULES. THAT YOU JUST EXPLAINED IT AND THAT'S PART OF THE CULTURE IS EXPLAINING IT TO PEOPLE SO THEY BUY INTO. SO BEFORE I GO TO SENATOR BATES SIDE. IT MADE ME THINK OF A QUESTION THIS IS A. DIFFICULT QUESTION BECAUSE IS TO COME OUT OF LEFT FIELD. SO SOME PEOPLE HAVE SUGGESTED THAT THE SOLUTION TO THIS IS TO ALLOW THE EMPLOYEES. THAT WORK OUT OF MORE OF OUR WORKFORCE TO UNIONIZE AND I'M WONDERING IF YOU'VE EXAMINED CULTURES THAT. FUNCTION UNDER. AND ONCE I DON'T AND IF YOU THINK THAT THAT AND THIS IS REALLY AN UNFAIR QUESTION YOU DON'T HAVE TO ANSWER BUT IF YOU IF YOU'VE SEEN THOSE KINDS OF OF DIFFERENCES. BASED ON THOSE THOSE KINDS OF STRUCTURES. NOT NOT REALLY A ONE OF THE LARGEST. IF IF YOU RECALL. CLASS ACTIONS AT THE TIME WAS THE MITSUBISHI MITSUBISHI MOTOR SALES OF AMERICA CASE THE BIG CLASS ACTION WERE WOMEN. WERE UNDERPAID. DE SYSTEMATICALLY AND NOT PROMOTED EXETER AND THEY HAVE A UNIONIZED ENVIRONMENT SO I THINK I'M I DON'T KNOW THAT UNIONS WILL SOLVE THE PROBLEM BECAUSE IT REALLY DOES SPEAK TO WHAT IS THE CULTURE. IN IN THIS ORGANIZATION SO SOUNDS LIKE A BROKEN RECORD BUT THAT THAT DOESN'T SOLVE FOR IN PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE ME THEIR SEXUAL HARASSMENT A UNIONIZED ENVIRONMENT TYPE SCENIC QUITE A BIT. RIGHT. OKAY THERE ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS BEFORE WE MOVE TO THE NEXT. SPEAKER. OKAY AND ACTUALLY MISTER TAYLOR I'M GONNA ASK YOU TO STAY IF YOU DON'T MIND BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT WORKING WITH OUTSIDE GROUPS IN YOUR REPRESENT AN OUTSIDE GROUP SO YOU MIGHT AS WELL TO SET UP THEIR CASE IS MORE QUESTIONS. I AND AND THANK YOU OTHER PANELISTS IS WAS REALLY FASCINATING AND EXTREMELY HELPFUL THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND I'LL ASK OUR MISTER GRIFFIN FROM THE NATIONAL CONFERENCE OF STATE LEGISLATORS TO COME UP AND PRESENT. THIS PANEL IS ABOUT MOVING FORWARD WITH PARTNERS. SO I'M GONNA JUST ASK. MISTER TAYLOR TO STAY IN CASE SINCE THEY ARE THE COULD BE PARTNERS OF US IN CASE ANYBODY HAS QUESTIONS BASED ON THE TESTIMONY WE HEAR THANK YOU. BERRYHILL AMOUNT THEIR WAY UP. UP SO MY NAME IS JONATHAN GRIFFIN I WORK FOR AND CECIL CENTER FOR LEGISLATIVE STRENGTHENING. I'M BENNETT NCSL FOR ABOUT EIGHT YEARS AND PRIOR TO THAT I WORK IN THE FLORIDA HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES THAT LIKE TO THINK. CHAIRMAN FREEMAN SHARON MITCHELL FOR HAVING ME AND ALL THE REST THE MEMBERS OF A OF THE COMMITTEES WELL. ICED WHAT TO SAY BECOMING ON LATE THOUGH SUCH A FASCINATING DISCUSSION A SOMEONE WHO CARES VERY MUCH ABOUT THE LEGISLATIVE INSTITUTION THAT'S KIND OF OUR GOAL WITHIN NCSL. UP IT'S GREAT TO SEE SO MANY PEOPLE COMMITTED TO IMPROVING THE LEGISLATIVE INSTITUTION. BECAUSE WE KNOW WE'VE BEEN AT THIS FOR AWHILE I WANT TO BE RESPECTFUL OF ERRANDS TIME. IT PROVIDES A BRIEF. REVIEW OF WHAT WE'VE DONE AND WHAT WE'RE PLANNING AND DOING GOING FORTH AND OPEN UP THE. THE GROUP TED OR OPEN UP A CONVERSATION EVERYONE. SO. NC SO BEGIN UPDATING OUR RESEARCH IS OUR RESOURCES REGARDING SEXUAL HARASSMENT POLICIES IN TRAINING AND AND JUST WITHIN THE LEGISLATURE IN EARLY TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN. REPRODUCED A TWO PAGE LARGEST BRIEF THAT THINK YOU HAVE IN THE BACK OF YOUR PACKET ON THE TOPIC IN JULY. AND THEN IN OCTOBER OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN. WE HELD A SEMINAR HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT WITH THE. CRATE FULL PARTICIPATION OF OF SHERMAN SPONSORSHIP. AND AS YOU CAN IMAGINE OCTOBER TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN. SEXUAL HARASSMENT TRAINING POLICIES WERE HOT TOPICS THROUGHOUT THE MEETING. AS RESPONSES INTEREST WE SENT A SURVEY ON SEXUAL HARASSMENT POLICIES AND TRAINING TO LEGISLATIVE HR PROFESSIONALS IN ALL FIFTY STATES. WE RECEIVED RESPONSES FROM TWENTY FIVE STATE LEGISLATURES AND AN ADDITIONAL ELEVEN LEGISLATIVE CHAMBERS INCLUDING ROUGHLY THIRTY EXAMPLES OF LEGISLATIVE SEXUAL HARASSMENT POLICIES. USING THOSE RESPONSES ALONG WITH CONSTIPATION FOR EXPERTS IN THE AREA WE WERE ABLE TO CREATE SOME RECOMMENDATIONS ABOUT A WHAT ABOUT WHAT A GOOD SEXUAL HARASSMENT POLICY SHOULD HAVE A WHAT GOOD TRAINING SHOULD ENTAIL. I'M NOT SURE I SEN IN. ACCOUNT A MEMO LATE LAST NIGHT NOT SURE IF IT MADE IT TO EVERYBODY. BUT I CAN KIND OF GO OVER THE THE BROAD STROKES OF IT. THAT'S WE TALKED ABOUT AT LENGTH ARE TODAY THERE'S NO. SILVER BULLET APPROACH TO TO PICK TO SOLVING THIS PROBLEM IS NO PANACEA. POLICIES ARE JUST ONE PART OF A COMPREHENSIVE SEXUAL HARASSMENT PREVENTION STRATEGY AS WE'VE HEARD TODAY THE CULTURE OF THE LEGISLATURE ALONG WITH HIGH QUALITY AND THOUGHTFUL TRAINING ARE EQUALLY AS IMPORTANT. BUT SEXUAL HARASSMENT POLICIES TO PROVIDE TV HUGE BENEFITS TO AN ORGANIZATION FIRST THEY SHOW THE EMPLOYEES THAT THEIR LEADERSHIP TAKES THE MATTER SERIOUSLY AND A PUT THOUGHT INTO CURBING THE BEHAVIOR. BY CRAFTING A POLICY THAT SERVES THEIR EMPLOYEES NEEDS OF THE THIRTY POLICIES YOU RECEIVE EACH ONE WAS UNIQUELY CRAFTED TO FIT THEIR LEGISLATIVE ENVIRONMENT. THERE'S NO COOKIE CUTTER OR UNIFORM POLICY THROUGHOUT THE THROUGHOUT THE THIRTY SECONDLY AND MOST IMPORTANTLY. WE'RE SEXUAL HARASSMENT POLICIES REALLY US SENATE TONE IS THEY PROVIDE A CLEAR PATH FOR A PERSON WHO BELIEVES THEY HAVE SUFFERED HARASSMENT TO MAKE THEIR CLAIM. CLEARLY THE PROCESS IS PARAMOUNT HERE GOOD POLICY SHOULD IMPROVE SHOULD PROVIDE EXAMPLES OF INAPPROPRIATE CONDUCT. IT SHOULD INCLUDE MULTIPLE CONTACTS FOR HARASSMENT VICTIM JUST REPORT ACCLAIM INCLUDING MAKING SURE THAT THEY UNDERSTAND THAT THE E. OC IN THE STATE'S HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION. CAN ALSO RECEIVE THOSE CLAIMS THAT THEY FEEL LIKE LEADERSHIP THEY DON'T HAVE A VOICE. IT SHOULD PROVIDE AN EXPLANATION OF THE INVESTIGATION PROCESS ARE GOING INTO IT THEY HAVE EXPECTATIONS ABOUT THE BREVITY IN THE CONFIDENTIALITY AND AND HOW LONG THE PROCESS SHOULD TAKE. AND SHOULD OUTLINED POTENTIAL DISCIPLINE FOR THE ACCUSED. OFTEN WE HEAR THAT PEOPLE DON'T MAKE COMPLAINTS BECAUSE THEY ARE AFRAID OF SOMEONE LOSING THEIR JOB IN THE ALTERNATIVE YOU WILL HEAR PEOPLE WHO ARE UPSET BY MAKING COMPLAINED THAT IT DIDN'T RESULT IN THAT MAKING CLEAR THAT THERE ARE NUMBER. OF POSSIBLE OUTCOMES. HELPS ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO REPORT MORE. BOB IT ALSO NEEDS TO PROVIDE A CLEAR STATEMENT PROHIBITING RETALIATION. AS FAR AS TRAINING GOES. ONE THING AGAIN THEY DIFFERED GREATLY IN IN QUALITY BUT ALMOST ALL STATES RESPONDED THAT AT MINIMUM TRAINING WITH AND YOU ON MANDATORY. BUT AFTER CONSULTING WITH NC SALES TRAINERS AND EXPERTS ARE REVIEWING OUR SURVEYS WE HAVE THE FOLLOWING RECOMMENDATIONS AS WELL. MOST IMPORTANT ALL AGAIN. IS THAT MUCH LIKE CHANGING THE CULTURE LEGISLATURE TRAINING IS THAT'S MOST EFFECTIVE WHEN THE LEADERSHIP IS FULLY ENGAGED AND SUPPORTIVE OF THE TRAINING IT SENDS A MESSAGE TO EVERYONE ELSE THAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO SEE THIS DONE IN THAT THERE. ARE ON BOARD NO A RECEPTIVE MEMBER OF OF THE COMMUNITY. IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TRAINERS IN CORPORATE LEGISLATIVE SPECIFIC EXAMPLES AT AS ALL OF YOU KNOW. YOU'RE NOT A LEGISLATOR FROM EIGHT AM TO FIVE PM YOUR LEGISLATOR MIDNIGHT YOUR LEGISLATOR AT TEN PM YOU'RE ALWAYS. REPRESENTING YOURSELF AND SO THAT THAT IMPROVE THAT INTERACTION WITH THE PUBLIC THAT INTERACTIONS IN THE EVENING. DOES SHOW ALSO NEED BE ACCOUNTED FOR PEOPLE NEED TO FULLY UNDERSTAND HOW THAT WORKS OUT TO THAT NOTE IT'S ALSO SOMETIMES IMPORTANT TO SEPARATE STAFF AND LEGISLATORS FROM TRAINING BECAUSE THE UNIQUE. POWER DYNAMICS AND THE UNIQUENESS OF THE JOBS. SO THAT WAS WE CAME ACROSS IN OCTOBER. IT WON'T SHOCK YOU TO HEAR THE MOST THESE POLICIES ALREADY OUTDATED BY THE TIME TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN CAME AROUND. SO FAR WERE A REBEL LEVIN STATES THAT IMPLEMENTED OR INTRODUCE NEW POLICIES. CHAMBER RULES ARE ETHICS RULES AND I EXPECT. MOSTLY ALL IF NOT ALL STATES TO BE REVIEWING THE POLICIES AS SESSIONS KEEP ON COMING IN. MOST THE CHANGES OF THESE ACTUALLY ARE MINOR SO FAR. THEY USUALLY JUST CLARIFY PROCEDURES ALREADY IN PLACE OF FOR EXAMPLE THE MEXICO CHANGE TO GENERAL REPORTING. OF LANGUAGE TO HAVE SPECIFIC PAUL. REPORTING FOR IF IT'S A STAFF MEMBER WHO'S FEELING HARASSED THE LEGISLATOR EVEN A THIRD PARTY LIKE A LOBBYIST. IN ADDITION TO THOSE POLICIES WERE ACTUALLY SEEING UNPRECEDENTED OUT OF LEGISLATION AS WELL ABOUT TYPICALLY THERE WOULD BE HARDLY ANY LEGISLATION IS A SAMPLE TO POLICIES INTERNAL. UP PROCEDURES. THIS YEAR WE'RE SEEING BILLS THAT INTRODUCED TASK FORCES OR COMMISSIONS ON SEXUAL HARASSMENT A BILL TO CREATE ANONYMOUS TIP CLIENTS TO REPORT SEXUAL HARASSMENT. AND BILLS LIKE THE WINDOWS INTRODUCED HERE THAT REQUIRE LEGISLATORS TO REIMBURSE THE STATE WHEN PUBLIC FUNDS ARE USE TO SETTLE COMPLAINTS A NEW YORK EVEN INTRODUCE LEGISLATION TO CREATE A CRIME OF OFFICIAL MISCONDUCT FOR STATE LEGISLATORS. SUCH REALLY WHAT WE'RE DOING. RIGHT NOW AS IT WAS SAID BEFORE AND ON FEBRUARY NINTH WE WILL BE CONDUCTING A WEAPON ARE ON THE TOPIC. WE ARE ALSO CURRENTLY COORDINATING TRAINING THAT WILL TAKEN PART THE THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE HAVE AND TRY TO BETTER SERVE OUR MEMBERSHIP THROUGH TRAINING. I REALLY DISPLACEMENT OPENING UP EVERYONE ELSE ABOUT GOING FORWARD AND WHAT WE CAN DO TO BETTER SERVE THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE GOING FORWARD IN THIS. TOPIC. Q. MISDEEDS I'M SORRY I DIDN'T HAVE A CHANCE TO ASK YOU IF YOU HAD A QUESTION. IN THE LAST. YEAH. YEAH WE WE WEEK ALONG LISTS FOR RIGHT FROM THE GET GO PUBLIC JEOPARDY WHERE PEOPLE ARE PUSHING HER BY. WELL MY AT MY WILL BE VERY CLEAR BECAUSE IT'S A KIND OF AN INTERESTING SITUATION THAT WE WITH JOHN AND WE HAD A NUMBER OF HARASSMENT COMPLAINTS RUN. OUR COMMUNITY REGARDING TREATMENT BY LAW ENFORCEMENT. SO RATHER THAN ELEVATE THOSE TO A POLICE COMMISSION ALL ABOUT WE WERE SEEKING OTHER WAYS TO BRING RECONCILIATION. TO THE SITUATION. AND CREATED A POLICE COMMUNITY RECONCILIATION PROGRAM. AND WHICH THE INDIVIDUAL WHO FELT THEY'D BEEN HARASSED IN THESE YOU KNOW APPROACH THINGS THAT YOU KNOW WOULD BE DEBT VERY DETRIMENTAL TO LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS CAREER. THEY VOLUNTARILY PARTICIPATED THE LAW ENFORCEMENT PEOPLE DEAD. SO THE QUESTION IS IS THERE A PLACE IN IN THE. TOOLS THAT WE WILL HAVE AS WE GO FORWARD. THAT A RECONCILIATION PROCESS CAN WORK WHEN YOU HAVE THIS POWER BASE BECAUSE THE WOULD BE HARD FOR. CA I AM A. STAFFORD TO A LEGISLATOR AND I FEEL I'VE BEEN HARASSED. SEXUALLY OR ANY OTHER WAY. DO YOU AYE AYE REPORT IT AND THEN I HAVE TO ASK IF THAT INDIVIDUAL SIT DOWN WITH ME AND WE CAN WORK THROUGH OUR PROBLEMS AND THAT REALLY. I JUST THE POWER RELATIONSHIP THAT IT WORKED. WHICH LAW ENFORCEMENT SO CAN'T WORK HERE AND HAVE YOU EVER USE THAT. UNOFFICIALLYAND AND IN SOME CASES OFFICIALLY THAT'S BEEN THE ROLE OF HR. THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU ENVISION SO ONCE YOU GET TO THE EEOC OR A THIRD PARTY YOU'RE NOW IN FULL DISPUTE MODE BUT IDEALLY WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN IF YOU HAVE THE RIGHT HR FUNCTION IS. OF ASSEMBLY WOMAN BATES ASSEMBLY OR SENATOR THEN SENATOR BATES ONE OFFICIAL CAN ARE ITEMS ARE BUT SENATOR BATES IS. LIVES DIRECTOR COMES IN AND SAYS I FEEL LIKE I'M BEING HARASSED IN THE WORKPLACE. AND BRINGS THAT TO AN HR FUNCTION THAT IS CAPABLE AND COMPETENT AND ALL THAT GOOD STUFF IDEALLY BECAUSE SOMETIMES. THAT PERSON'S DEFINITION OF HARASSMENT MAY BE YOU KNOW THE LAY PERSON'S DEFINITION OF HARASSMENT IS NOT ALWAYS LEGAL HARASSED. THAT I WAS WITH. THE SENATOR ON A TRIP. AND SHE NEEDED X. THAT MORNING SHE ASKED ME TO GO OUT AND GET IT. AND I FELT HARASSED BY. IN SO WE OFTENTIMES BY NATURE FUNCTION PUTTING THE TWO PARTIES IN THE ROOM WILL REALIZE THAT IS EITHER MISC UNDERSEA IT'S MISCOMMUNICATION MISUNDERSTANDING MULTI GENERATIONAL CONVERSATIONS BECAUSE THE WAY THAT WE TALK IS NOT THE WAY A TWENTY ONE YEAR OLD OX. AND SO A LOT OF THAT IS AT PLAY THERE SOME REAL POWER DYNAMICS THERE WE HAVE FOUND THAT HR CAN ACTUALLY SERVE IN THAT OFFICIAL RECONCILIATION ROLE AND IF WE WORK WELL THROUGH THIS WE KEEP BOTH TALENT. YOU KNOW YOU DON'T IT'S NOT AN EITHER OR THAT'S THE PROBLEM WHEN YOU GET INTO THE TREE IN THE REAL ADVERSARIAL KIND OF SOMEONE HAS TO WIN AND SOMEONE HAS TO LOSE AND GOD FOR BID YOU'VE GOT NO LAWYER INVOLVED. AS WELL HAD BECAUSE THEY DON'T MAKE MONEY IF YOU TO JUST RECORD. BUT THAT'S NOT THE ANGLE THE ANGLE IS YOU NEED TO LOSE SO THAT I CAN GET MY THIRD OR WHATEVER I KNOW CALIFORNIA. HAS DIFFERENT WHO YOU KNOW A CONTINGENCY RULES BUT THEREIN LIES THE PROBLEM IS ONCE IT'S GONE EXTERNAL AN ADVERSARIAL YOU'VE A REAL YOUR ABILITY TO MANAGE IT NOT CONTROLLING BECAUSE WE'RE CONTROL SUGGEST THAT YOU TRY TO HIDE IT. IT'S NOT IT'S JUST SOMETIMES THE PARTIES HAVE MISSED EACH OTHER IN PASSING AND THERE'S A PROBLEM THERE AND WHEN YOU DEAL WITH THAT YOU COULD SAY PUT TALENTS ALONG ITS I'VE SEEN THAT WORK WE DON'T CALL IT RECONCILIATION PROGRAMS BECAUSE YOU. TITLE SEVEN OF THE LEGAL REQUIREMENTS AND SOMETIMES THE SEA SAYS YOU CAN'T WORK AROUND OUR PROCESS BUT I THINK THE OPPORTUNITY AND WE'VE SEEN IT WORK IS A STRONG HR FUNCTION WILL GENERALLY GET YOU TO THAT PRETTY QUICKLY. AND I JUST LIKE TO ADD UP THE STATE OR IN ACTUALLY IN THEIR LEGISLATURE IS A VERY STRONG INFORMAL COMPLAINT PROCESS. AND AGAIN I THINK THIS THIS LEADS TO THERE'S YOU KNOW KIND OF A GENERAL IDEA THAT MOST THE TIME WHEN YOU MAKE A COMPLAINT. YOU'RE NOT ASKING FOR RESULT IS WHAT BEHAVIORS STOP. AND AS LONG AS YOU HAVE AN HR FONG AT AGE OUR COMMUNITY THAT FEELS EMPOWERED TO DO SO THAT SHOULD ALWAYS BE AN OPTION. AND THERE ARE SOME STATES THAT ACTUALLY PUT THAT INTO THEIR POLICY TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE AWARE AGAIN THAT. THERE'S NOT IN THIS DOZEN DICTATORS ALL THERE'S THERE'S A LOT OF WAYS TO HANDLE COMPLY. CAN I JUST RAISE IT BECAUSE LIKE INCOME THE DUE PROCESS AND ACCUSED. SHOULD HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY. HA IF THEY THROW MY GOD I DIDN'T MEAN TO DO THAT I DO NOT KNOW HOW TO HAVE SOMETHING THAT'S QUITE. YOU KNOW IN TERMS THE CONSEQUENCES A LOT LESS THIS COMPARED TO MOVING UP THE LADDER DO SOMETHING THAT SEXUAL ASSAULT. KNOW THAT TOUGH CANNED GOODS BECAUSE I I THINK I'D LIKE TO. SO US TO EXPLORE THAT AS WE'RE STARTING TO PUT TOGETHER OUR STRUCTURE. MISTER GRIFFIN HOW CAN NCSL HELP US AS WE MOVE FORWARD IN THIS PROCESS. NUMBER REALLY IN ANY WAY YOU ASK US TO. WHERE YOUR ORGANIZATION AND WE TAKE THAT VERY SERIOUSLY ON AS FAR AS THAT'S COMING TO PROVIDE FURTHER TESTIMONY IS THAT'S FAR AS? GIVING IT DOING TRAINING. REGARDING THE TOPIC. RELIEF IF YOU ASK FOR IT WE WILL PROBABLY FIND A WAY TO DO IT. THAT'S DISCOUNTED GENERALLY OUR MOTTO THROUGHOUT. ANYTHING IN THIS IS A TOPIC THAT WE TAKE EXTRAORDINARILY SERIOUSLY AND AS AS WE GOTTA TALK EARLIER THIS IS NOT A CALIFORNIA ONLY PROBLEM I MEAN WE ARE WE ARE COMING UP WITH STUFF. THROUGHOUT THE BOARD BECAUSE THIS IS AFFECTING SO MANY OF OUR CONSTITUENTS. Q. AND. MISTER GRIFFIN MENTIONED LEGISLATION SIMILAR THAT TO WHAT WAS INTRODUCED HERE HAVING LEGISLATORS HAVING TO PAY. SETTLEMENT I'M WONDERING MISTER TAYLOR SOMEONE WITH A LOT OF EXPERIENCE IN THIS. IN THIS FIELD WHAT DO YOU THINK THE RAMIFICATIONS OF THAT COULD BE. WELL THAT'S A TOUGH ONE. IT IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR GOOD BY COMPARISON WE WE ALL WORK AND WE HAVE DO YOU KNOW POLICY WRITER DIRECTORS AND OFFICES LIABILITY POLICY AND SO. EVEN IF YOU FOUND HAVE DONE IT TYPICALLY. IT'S IT'S NOT AT PERSONAL RISK TO YOU. I'VE I'VE WHILE I APPRECIATE AND UNDERSTAND WHERE THEY'RE GOING WITH THAT THERE IS A TON OF RISK THAT I THINK REALLY GOOD PEOPLE MIGHT DECIDE NOT TO DO THIS WORK. IF THEY THINK THEY'RE GONNA SUBJECT THE PERSONAL ASSETS TO EXPOSURE. AND MAYBE AYE FUNDAMENTALLY STARTED BELIEVING IN PEOPLE I BELIEVE THERE ARE FEW BAD ACTORS BUT I WOULD HATE TO PROPOSE POLICY OR. FOR POLICIES THAT WOULD HARM OR HAVE THE IMPACT OF MAKING THE NINETY FIVE PERCENT OF US WHO WILL FOLLOW THE RULES SAY YOU KNOW IT'S JUST NOT WORTH IT I DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO. MORTGAGE MY HOUSE WOULD GIVE UP MY EXPORT THIS RISK. AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I SAW IN PRACTICE. WHICH YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S REALLY TOUGH TO A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE SETTLED SEXUAL HARASSMENT CLAIMS. AND I'M TALKING FROM BUSINESS THE BUSINESS MAKES THE DECISION TO DO IT. NOT THE INDIVIDUAL IT'S NOT IN THE BEST INTEREST OF PARAMOUNT PICTURES TO BE ALL OVER THE NEW SO WE SOLVE PER THAT PROBLEM. AND WE RESOLVE IT EVEN IF ONE OF OUR EXECUTIVES DECIDED THEY WANTED TO FIGHT IT FIGHT IT TO THE END AND THAT'S THE REALITY AND I THINK YOU WILL BE CONFRONTED WITH SOMETHING. VERY SIMILAR TO THAT I THINK ABOUT THE WOMAN WHO RAN FOR CONGRESS WAS RUNNING FOR CONGRESS IN KANSAS OUT OF A BEAUTY IF YOU FOLLOW IT DEMOCRATIC. CANDIDATE FOR OUR CONGRESS AND. SHE HAD BEEN A HEAD OF HR INTERESTINGLY TWENTY OR SO YEARS IN THE PAST AND HAVE BEEN ACCUSED OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT BY A MALE EMPLOYEE. I SHE NEVER OF AGREED THAT OCCURRED SHE NEVER ADMITTED TO IT. THE COMPANY WAS SUBSEQUENTLY PURCHASED AND MARK SOME SORT OF MNA THEY SETTLED THE CLAIM WITHOUT HER. NOW WOULD BE RIGHT TO THINK COME BACK AND MAKE HER CHIP IN WITH THEY MADE THE SETTLEMENT I CAN TELL YOU WHAT DID HAPPEN THE DNC PULLED AWAY AT SUPPORT OF HER AND SHE PULLED OUT OF THE RACE. AND THAT WAS AN ALLEGATION THAT WAS SETTLED BY HER EMPLOYER SUITS A REALLY COMPLICATED ISSUE FIRST YOU'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE WILL THE BEST PEOPLE. PRACTICALLY SUBJECT THAT YOU'RE A BUSINESS OWNER YOU KNOW YOUR WIFE WILL LET YOU RUN IF SHE PICKS MY GOSH SOMEONE ACCUSES YOU OF SOMETHING RIGHTLY OR WRONGLY AND NOW YOU'VE EXPOSED OUR FAMILIES. BASE OF WEALTH NO JUST IT'S NOT WORTH IT AND THEN THE OTHER SIDE IS EVEN WHEN IT DOESHAPPEN IF IT IF YOU ULTIMATELY CONCLUDE THAT IT'S IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE STATE THERE TIMES WHEN YOU CAN TO SETTLE IT. EVEN IF YOU DON'T ACTUALLY BELIEVE IN THE UNDERLYING CLAIM. THAT'S THE CHALLENGE AS A PRACTITIONER. CONSTANTLY DEALING IN REALITY YOU'D BE NICE TO FIGHT UNTIL THE END BUT SOMETIMES JUST DOESN'T MAKES. DID THAT ANSWER YOUR QUESTION. CHAIRMAN YEAH IT SHOWS US I THINK THE COMPLEXITY OF THESE ISSUES AND THE NEW WANTS AND ALSO THE POTENTIAL FOR. UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES EVEN WITH THINGS THAT ON THEIR FACE MAKE A LOT OF SENSE. WHICH SEEMS TO HAPPEN A LOT WHEN YOU'RE DEALING SORT OF WITH THE LEGAL ROUND. AND JUST YOU KNOW TRYING TO ANTICIPATE WHERE THINGS MIGHT GO. OTHER QUESTIONS FOR FINAL PANEL MYSTERIOUS. MISTER GRIFFIN IN THE TWO PAGE ARTICLE THAT YOU PROVIDED TO US. IN BEYOND IT SAID. TOWARDS THE END CALIFORNIA IS ONE OF THE FEW STATES THAT MANDATES SEXUAL HARASSMENT TRAINING BY STATUTE. YET WE FIND OURSELVES IN A SITUATION WHEREIN. UP WOULD YOU AGREE THAT. I'M SURE YOU HEARD MOST OF THE PANELISTS BEFORE YOU. TALKING ABOUT CULTURE. AND TO THE FACT THAT IT REALLY IS AN ISSUE OF CULTURE BEFORE IT IS ANYTHING ELSE. YES I THINK ABSOLUTELY I THINK AS. PROFESSOR DAN HARTZ SAID ABOUT IN HER PRESENTATION CULTURE EATS EVERYTHING ELSE UP. THEIR CULTURES IS THE OVER ARCHING THAT'S AGAIN WHY I THINK THIS IS SUCH A POSITIVE FROM FROM THE TO SONY CARES ABOUT THE LEGISLATIVE INSTITUTIONS SUCH A POSITIVE EXPERIENCE. BECAUSE SEEING THAT CULTURE IS REALLY. THE MOST IMPORTANT STEP AND YOU DON'T LEADERSHIP BY AND THOSE THINGS ARE REALLY WOULD HELP SET THE TONE THE MOST MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE YOU CAN COME UP WITH. AND ALSO WHAT DISCIPLINE ESSAYS CALIFORNIA BE ONE OF THE FEW THAT MANDATES TRAINING IS AGAIN WHY WE HAD NEVER SEEN LEGISLATION REALLY ON THIS BECAUSE IT'S ALMOST ALL TIME. BOB BENNETT INTERNAL POLICIES. THANK YOU. SOMEONE NUMBER WALDRON I'M. SINCE WE HAVE SOMEONE WHO HAS DEALT WITH LEGISLATURE'S THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY I THOUGHT IT WAS APPROPRIATE KIND OF CIRCLE BACK WITH. WHAT WE STARTED OFF THE HEARING ABOUT? TALKING MORE ABOUT DESIGNING DIVERSE ORGANIZATIONS. AS OAK POTENTIAL GOAL TO. STEM YOU KNOW THIS CONTINUOUS. ENCOURAGING MORE WOMEN TO SERVE IN CAPACITIES. I THINK IN THE MY I MIGHT BE OFF. RIGHT NOW BECAUSE WE JUST. BURDEN WHEN THE ISN'T A NEW LEGISLATIVE AND I THINK THIS TWENTY SIX OR TWENTY SEVEN WOMEN. CURRENTLY SERVING OUT OF A HUNDRED AND TWENTY. LEGISLATIVE POSITIONS SO IT'S. AMONG SOLOISTS. IF FOR A STATE SINCE NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT. WHAT HAVE YOU SEEN OR HAVE YOU SEEN IN OTHER STATES? ENCOURAGE MORE WOMEN TO PARTICIPATE IN THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS. I THINK ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WITH CALIFORNIA IT'S IS SO BIG. THAT A LOT OF WOMEN. YOU KNOW. AND THE STRUCTURE IS SO OUT OF DATE HOW WE DO OUR PROCEDURES AND OPERATIONS THAT IT DISCOURAGES WOMEN BECAUSE IT'S NOT FAMILY FRIENDLY IT'S INFLEXIBLE. TO A TEE TO SERVE. THE YOU KNOW IF YOUR MOM IS VERY DIFFICULT I HAD TOLD MISS MY SON'S BIRTHDAY YOU KNOW A. YOU BASICALLY HAVE TO TAKE. TIME OFF TO THE EVEN STAY IN THE DISTRICT. THAT DISCOURAGES WOMEN WHAT HAVE YOU SEEN IS THERE ANY. EFFORTS IN OTHER STATES. TO WORK ON THE MORE DIVERSE MORE EQUITABLE MORE. FLEXIBLE. COURSE IF YOU LIVE IN A SMALLER STATUS EASY TO COME INVOLVEMENT CALIFORNIA'S SYSTEM VERY DIFFICULT. YEAH I'M I MEAN I WOULD SAY EVEN UP BEYOND WOMEN I THINK THERE'S THERE'S A GENERAL. DEMAND THAT LEGISLATORS DON'T MATCH THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF VIRTUALLY ANY STATE IN ANY IN RELIGION AND IN THE RACE AND GENDER. UP ACROSS THE BOARD BUT ULTIMATELY BEYOND ENCOURAGEMENT I MEAN THE VOTERS ARE ARE WHO LACKS THE PEOPLE THE PEOPLE LIVE OUTSIDE OF VERY FEW CIRCUMSTANCES YOU DON'T GET SELECTED TO BE A LEGISLATOR YOU KNOW YOU RUN. AND SO WHILE THERE'S ENCOURAGEMENT THERE'S ONLY SO MUCH THAT CAN REALLY HAPPEN ON THAT SIDE AND I THINK IT'S REALLY A STATE SPECIFIC I MEAN THROUGH THE STATE DECIDES TO CUT BACK IN THE ELECTION. IF THEY BACK MORE BUT YOU KNOW IF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY TO THE REPUBLICAN PARTY ASIDE SETBACK THE CANDIDATES THAN. YOU SEE SOMETHING DIFFERENTLY WAS LIKE SO MUCH THAT THEY CAN REALLY BE DONE. OKAY IF THERE'S NO MORE QUESTIONS RIGHT NOW I DO WANT TO MOVE TO PUBLIC COMMENT IS THERE ANYBODY HERE WHO WANTS TO. TYPE YOU CAN PLEASE GO TO THE MICROPHONE. AND I WANT TO THANK THE WITNESSES VERY MUCH FOR YOUR INPUT. THANK YOU FAT THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK. WHO CLOSER? CAN HEAR ME NOW. MY NAME IS CARMEN FIELDS AND I AM A SURVIVOR OF A HOSTILE WORK ENVIRONMENT. WHICH INCLUDED A SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND ASSAULT ADVANCEMENT EMPLOYEE. WHILE I WAS EMPLOYED BY THE CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL. ONE ATTACKER WAS A NEW HIRE. AND. WHILE THIS HAPPENED DURING HIS PROBATIONARY PERIOD IF HE FREELY ADMITTED TO DOING EVERYTHING. AS DETAILED IN THE STATE PERSONNEL BOARD. RULING. HE WAS PASSED ON PROBATION. AND HE STILL WORKS FOR THE STATE. I ON THE OTHER HAND WAS ENCOURAGED AND. MOVE TO A LESS DESIRABLE POSITION OUTSIDE OF HEADQUARTERS. BECAUSE I MADE HIM UNCOMFORTABLE. THE CHP TOOK OVER ELEVEN MONTHS TO DO THEIR INVESTIGATION. AND WAS LEFT IN THE DARK. JUST HAD A COMPLETE NEGATIVE IMPACT ON MY LIFE. AND MY CAREER. AS I AM NO LONGER EMPLOYED AND OF MY NAME SOUNDS FAMILIAR. I WAS. IN NOVEMBER THE CUT ON TO SACRAMENTO BEE. STORY. I WAS THE HOST BUT THIS INCIDENT DURING INTERVIEWS FOR PROMOTION. OF WHICH I NEVER GOT A PROMOTION. YOU WANT TO CHANGE CULTURE. VICTIMS SHOULD MAKE UP TO RELIVE THE EXPERIENCE OVER AND OVER. YOU SHOULD THE SANDMAN SPECIALLY ONE LITTLE. WORK UNDERCOVER TO COME TO YOUR HOME TO INVESTIGATE YOUR WEALTHY ATTACK. ALL OF YOU SHOULD HE SHOULD BE PROHIBITED FROM REQUIRE VICTIMS OF HARASSMENT. TO LEAVE IF. THE REPLACEMENT. AS PART OF A SETTLEMENT. I WAS MAKING EXAMPLE OF HER REPORTING. MANY WOMEN NOW ARE AFRAID TO REPORT BECAUSE THEY SAW WHAT HAPPENED TO ME THEY SAW HER I WAS TREATED. I WANTED TO I WANT MY JOB BACK. AND I WOULD REALLY LIKE YOU TO ENCOURAGE HUGE BE TO GIVE ME MY JOB BACK. AND MAKE ME A STATE EMPLOYEE IT GIVEN. IT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT TO SAY. WILL REACH OUT TO YOU. IT SHOWS THE IMPORTANCE OF THE WORK THAT WE'RE DOING HERE BECAUSE WE'VE CERTAINLY HAD EMPLOYEES IN THIS BUILDING. WHO HAVE GOTTEN UP AND TOLD SIMILAR STORIES? IS ANYBODY HAVE ANY FINAL COMMENTS. THIS REYES. THOUGH I'M SORRY. ONE MORE ONE MORE SPEAKER. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS OTIS JACKSON. I DON'T HAVE ANY PREPARED COMMENTS FOR TODAY I'M I WISH I'D BEEN ABLE TO GET ON THE AGENDA THIS IS BEEN A VERY. THOUGHTFUL AND OPEN MINDED. FORUM WE'VE LEARNED A LOT OF INFORMATION. WHAT I'D LIKE TO SAY IS THAT TIME? I WORK IN CALIFORNIA STATE GOVERNMENT FOR QUITE A FEW YEARS I'VE BEEN TRAINED AS A. INSTRUCTOR AND FACILITATOR AND SEXUAL HARASSMENT PREVENTION. IT'S VERY TECHNICAL LIFE'S WORK IS VERY SPECIFIC. ON THERE ARE. ROLES DUTIES RESPONSIBILITIES THAT ARE LAID OUT FOR ALL LEVEL OF THE HIERARCHY IN AN ORGANIZATION TO BE FOLLOW. THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE PROTECTIONS IN PLACE. TO PROTECT THE. CHOOSER. ALEX THE PERSON AT. PRESENTS THE ALLEGATION AND THEY ARE TO. PROCEDURES IN PLACE TO PROTECT THE INDIVIDUAL THAT THE ALLEGATIONS HAVE BEEN MADE ABOUT. THE DUTY TO RESPOND. IS A DUTY TO RESPOND AT THE LOWEST RESPONSIBLE LEVEL. KEEP VIS RELIABILITY. AND THAT'S ABILITY OF THE WORK ENVIRONMENT GOVERNMENT. NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION BUSINESS IN A CIVILIZED AND EIGHT LEGAL MATTER. I GOT INTERESTED IN THIS PARTICULAR FORM BECAUSE I WAS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ON TWO TEN. AND I HEARD AN INTERVIEW. BY ASSEMBLY WOMAN GARCIA. SO I PULLED OVER AND CALLED HER OFFICE. BECAUSE I THINK I HAVE SOMETHING TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE SITUATION. I THINK I HAVE SOMETHING TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE SITUATION I CAME UP AND MET WITH HER BRIEFLY ON MONDAY. AND SHE RECOMMENDED STAYING OVER FOR THE PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD. I WANT TO TALK TO THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS THE CHAIRMAN OF THE RULES COMMITTEE ABOUT TRAINING LEGISLATIVE STAFF. I THINK LEGISLATIVE STAFF CAN BE TRAINED ON A REGIONAL BASIS. THE QUALITY OF THE TRAINING IS ESSENTIAL. ONE OF THE. INTRICATE ASPECTS AND ONE OF THE COMPARATIVE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT TRAINING IS THAT IT'S NOT EFFECTIVE. YOU HAVE TO HAVE IT BUT IT'S NOT EFFECTIVE. WELL ONE THING AND I'M GOING TO BE BRIEF HERE BUT ONE OF THE THINGS ABOUT IT THE A. B. EIGHTEEN TWENTY FIVE STANDARD FOR TRAINING PUT TO OUR PERIOD. BECAME A PROLIFERATION OF VIDEOS. SO THE POLITICAL RACE IN THE VIDEOS ONLY GAVE YOUR TIME AWAY FROM YOUR DESK. WHERE YOU COULD GO AND YOU CAN SEE SOMETHING YOU'RE PROBABLY ON THE WAY INTO THAT? TRAINING. SEE THE VIDEO.% ANYONE WHO WOULD HAVE TO SAY BECAUSE THERE ARE PEOPLE TO TALK ABOUT THESE THINGS IN A GIDDY CONAWAY. WE KNOW THAT. BUT. TALK ABOUT. TRAINING IT HAS TO BE ON SITE IT HAS TO BE IMMERSIVE HAS TO BE ROLE PLAYING. IT'S GOTTA BE VERY SPECIFIC TO TALK ABOUT THE LIABILITY THAT THE INDIVIDUAL AND ORGANIZATION PASS. BECAUSE THERE NEW LAWS AND STANDARDS THAT. GIVE COURTS THE OPPORTUNITY TO GIVE SEVENTY FIVE TWENTY FIVE FIFTY FIFTY OR SOME. LEVEL OF. LIABILITY. AND YOUR PERSONAL RESOURCES CAN BECOME CHALLENGE. BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY THE BUSINESS ORGANIZATION. IN THE NONPROFIT. THEIR BUSINESS TAKES VERY BAD HIT. IN THE PUBLIC AND FINANCIALLY. SO IN THE TRAINING WHAT I PROPOSE TO DO. IS TO TRAIN INDIVIDUALS ABOUT THEIR RESPONSIBILITY. AND OBLIGATE THEM. FOR CHANGING THE CULTURE. IS TO GET THEM TO DO A COUPLE OF. TRAINING TECHNIQUE. ITEMS. THAT WILL ENSURE THAT THE LIABILITY OF THE EMPLOYER DETERMINATE I GIVE YOU ONE MORE MINUTE PLEASE YANKEE THAT DETERMINE THAT THE. THAT THE LIABILITY STANDARD THAT THE EMPLOYEE. HAS THEY BECOME VERY CLEAR ON. AND WITH THAT. LATER ABOUT BE HAPPY TO COME BACK SACRAMENTO ME. TALK TO THE GROUP PREPARE SOME. DIRECT COMMENTS. I HAVE A TENTATIVE. TRAINING OUTLINED. THAT WILL ACCOMPLISH ALL THOSE THINGS IF YOU ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT EARLIER TODAY THAT YOU HEARD THE NEGATIVES ASSOCIATED WITH. THE SEXUAL HARASSMENT PREVENTION TRAINING. I HAVE THAT AND I'M A CERTIFIED BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT TRANSPORTATION. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH SIR. DOES ANYBODY HAVE ANY FINAL COMMENTS. THE DAY. REYES. LEAVE MY PLAN WITH YOU. OKAY WE ONE MORE SPEAKER I'M GONNA ASK ANYBODY ELSE WHO WANTS TO SPEAK TO PLEASE GO GET UP AND GET IN LINE NOW OTHERWISE THIS WILL BE THE FINAL SPEAKER IN TWO MINUTES PLEASE OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ON MY FEEL ARE MORE OPTIMISTIC. AFTER HEARING ALL THIS DISCUSSED BUT I DID WHEN I CAME IN. I'M THE REASON I'M HERE IS WE'VE BEEN VISITING WITH STAFF IN THE CAPITAL HERE PER. FEW WEEKS. MAYBE IN A COUPLE MONTHS AND WE'VE HAD A SPECIFIC. ALONG THE PER TRYING TO HAVE. PUT ON THE BOOKS EXACTLY STATE YOUR NAME FOR THE RECORD PLEASE HOMONYMS ROGER BENTLEY. AND UP WHAT WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO ADVOCATE FOR IS AN ADJUSTMENT IN CLERGY. MANDATED REPORTING. AND IN OUR VISITING WE CAME THIS COMMISSION CAME TO OUR ATTENTION. AND WE REALIZE THAT THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS THAT WE HAVE TO SAY. I REPRESENT A NETWORK PEOPLE THEIR AUTHORS. CHILD VIEW SURVIVORS. PSYCHOLOGISTS AND WE REALIZE THAT THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS THAT WE CAN SHARE WITH YOU. THAT IF NOTHING ELSE YOU COULD LEARN FROM THE MISTAKES OF THE CULTURE THAT I CAME FROM. AND ONE THING THAT I WANT TO MENTION THAT I THINK IS VERY IMPORTANT TO THIS DISCUSSION. IS THE CONCEPT OF UNDUE INFLUENCE. NOW. I'VE SEEN UNDUE INFLUENCE IN JUST BRIEFAMOUNT OF TIME THAT I'VE BEEN HERE VISITING. IT'S THE OUR WORD IS RELIGION. PEOPLE ARE AFRAID. TO TAKE THAT ON. I WANT I WANT TO TELL YOU ENOUGH WASN'T GOING TO BRING THAT UP BUT WHAT I WANT TO TELL YOU. IS THAT. CULTURE IS AFFECTED. BY THE WAY THAT RELIGIOUS LEADERS ARE BEING TREATED. IF YOU MAKE AN EXCEPTION. FOR CLERGYMAN OR PRIEST WHO IS ABUSING CHILDREN. THAT'S GONNA AFFECT YOUR CULTURE. SO I'D LIKE TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO. GOING TO DETAIL WITH YOU ON THIS AT A FUTURE TIME. I'M MY GIVEN OUT PRINT MIKE. CONTACT INFORMATION. I'M JUST GOING CONCLUDED I'M AWARE PERSONALLY OF PEOPLE THAT ARE SUFFERING. A GREAT DEAL BECAUSE OF THE EXCEPTIONS THAT ARE MADE TO. CLERGY AND PEOPLE IN POSITIONS OF POWER. SO IN THIS OUT HIS FEAR OF. I'M ASKING YOU WOULD HAVE THE COURAGE. TO TAKE THIS ISSUE ON. AND I CAN POINT OUT TO THE CALIFORNIA LAW. FORMERLY. IT'S ON THE BOOKS. FOR CLERGY MANDATED REPORTING. CALIFORNIA COURTS HAVE BEEN RULING. AGAINST THE FIRST AMENDMENT DEFENSE. AND ALL OVER TRYING TO PROPOSE SPECIFICALLY IS TO TAKE THOSE RULINGS. CODIFY THEM IN THE CALIFORNIA LAW. SEE ENOUGH OF THIS LEGISLATION ENOUGH OF THIS LITIGATION. AND THIS IS GET TO THE POINT. CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE IS A CRIME AND NEEDS TO BE REPORTED TO THE AUTHORITIES. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR. SOME APPARATUS. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIRMAN I JUST I AM VERY PLEASED WITH THE DIRECTION OF THIS COMMITTEE. I REALLY APPRECIATE. BEGINNING WITH THE ISSUE OF CULTURE. AS ARE SENATOR INDICATED THERE IT'S A COLLECTIVE EYE ROLLING. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THIS. BUT IT IS CLEAR FROM THE TESTIMONY THAT WE'VE RECEIVE TODAY. THAT THAT IS WHERE WE MUST BEGIN. AND I APPRECIATE NOW THAT WE WILL BE DIGGING DEEP. CENTER MORE LOCK. JUST AS WE'RE LOOKING FOR WHAT WHAT THE NEXT STEPS ARE AND I APPRECIATE THE DIRECTION OF THIS COMMITTEE. THANK YOU AND I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR EVERYBODY'S NAM FOCUS AND EVERYBODY BEING PRESENT OF FOR THE MEETING AND I HOPE THAT WE CONTINUE THAT THAT.
