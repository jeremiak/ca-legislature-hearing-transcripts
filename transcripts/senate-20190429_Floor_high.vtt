00:16:27.019 --> 00:16:30.222
IN ORTHODOX RELIGIOUS SIR OF THE

00:16:30.289 --> 00:16:32.491
CEMETERIES YOU CAN'T BE BURIED.

00:16:32.558 --> 00:16:33.659
BECAUSE THAT WAS A VIOLATION OF

00:16:33.726 --> 00:16:36.161
CAUGHT.

00:16:36.228 --> 00:16:37.863
SO THERE WERE EXEMPTIONS GIVEN

00:16:37.930 --> 00:16:39.431
BECAUSE OF COURSE THESE WERE NOT

00:16:39.498 --> 00:16:42.368
PEOPLE WHO CHOSE THE FIND

00:16:42.434 --> 00:16:43.635
THEMSELVES TATTOOED WITH NUMBERS.

00:16:43.702 --> 00:16:44.937
AND IF THEY WERE FORTUNATE

00:16:45.003 --> 00:16:46.505
ENOUGH TO SURVIVE.

00:16:46.572 --> 00:16:48.073
THE PRISON CAMPS IN THE IN

00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:49.808
HUMANITY THEY SUFFERED THE LAST

00:16:49.875 --> 00:16:51.910
INDIGNITY THAT THEY SHOULD EVER

00:16:51.977 --> 00:16:52.911
HAVE TO SUFFER.

00:16:52.978 --> 00:16:54.847
WITH NOT BEING ABLE TO BE BURIED

00:16:54.913 --> 00:16:56.215
WITH THEIR FAMILIES IN THE

00:16:56.281 --> 00:16:59.985
CEMETERIES OF EUROPE.

00:17:00.052 --> 00:17:02.988
SO A REMINDER.

00:17:03.055 --> 00:17:04.523
THE **** REGIME TARGETED ALL

00:17:04.590 --> 00:17:06.091
JEWS.

00:17:06.158 --> 00:17:07.593
RUSSIA KILLED OVER A MILLION

00:17:07.659 --> 00:17:08.494
JEWS.

00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:10.429
MY ANCESTORS HAD FORTUNATELY

00:17:10.496 --> 00:17:11.797
LEFT RUSSIA.

00:17:11.864 --> 00:17:13.766
DURING THE POGROMS ANOTHER

00:17:13.832 --> 00:17:15.734
SPIRIT OF ANTI SEMITISM THAT

00:17:15.801 --> 00:17:17.436
HAPPENED IN THE LATE EIGHTEEN

00:17:17.503 --> 00:17:19.071
NINETIES IN THE EARLY NINETEEN

00:17:19.138 --> 00:17:20.372
HUNDREDS AND I WOULD SUBMIT.

00:17:20.439 --> 00:17:21.373
THAT A GOOD PORTION OF THE

00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:22.608
JEWISH POPULATION IN THIS

00:17:22.674 --> 00:17:23.675
COUNTRY.

00:17:23.742 --> 00:17:26.078
CAME DURING THAT PERIOD OF TIME

00:17:26.145 --> 00:17:27.980
SO MY FAMILY WAS LUCKY TO GET

00:17:28.046 --> 00:17:29.348
OUT BUT NOT ALL MY FAMILY GOT

00:17:29.415 --> 00:17:30.682
OUT.

00:17:30.749 --> 00:17:32.084
I HAD FAMILY IN POLAND.

00:17:32.151 --> 00:17:34.019
THEY DIDN'T LEAVE.

00:17:34.086 --> 00:17:35.821
FAMILY IN RUSSIA THE DIDN'T

00:17:35.888 --> 00:17:37.790
LEAVE AND THEY WERE MURDERED.

00:17:37.856 --> 00:17:39.091
BY THE GERMANS.

00:17:39.158 --> 00:17:41.326
DURING THE WAR SO I HAVE A

00:17:41.393 --> 00:17:43.695
PERSONAL CONNECTION AS I SUSPECT

00:17:43.762 --> 00:17:44.897
AS WE DO.

00:17:44.963 --> 00:17:47.132
FIND OUR DNA SO MANY OF YOU HERE

00:17:47.199 --> 00:17:49.001
IN THIS ROOM SURPRISINGLY WILL

00:17:49.067 --> 00:17:50.636
DISCOVER THAT INDEED.

00:17:50.702 --> 00:17:52.337
YOU HAVE ANCESTORS WHO ALSO WERE

00:17:52.404 --> 00:17:55.073
JEWISH.

00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:57.209
BECAUSE WE'RE ALL ONE HUMANITY.

00:17:57.276 --> 00:17:58.844
AND THE FACT THAT WE FORGET THAT

00:17:58.911 --> 00:18:00.813
IS PART OF THE REASON WE NEED TO

00:18:00.879 --> 00:18:02.147
REMEMBER IT HERE TODAY

00:18:02.214 --> 00:18:02.448
[inaudible]

00:18:02.514 --> 00:18:04.550
SO.

00:18:04.616 --> 00:18:06.118
NOT ONLY DID THEY TARGET JEWS

00:18:06.185 --> 00:18:07.886
BUT THEY PARTICULARLY SUBJECTED

00:18:07.953 --> 00:18:10.088
WOMEN BOTH JEWISH AND NON JEWISH

00:18:10.155 --> 00:18:12.991
TO IN HUMANE TREATMENT AND ABUSE.

00:18:13.058 --> 00:18:15.127
WOMEN MADE UP TO MILLION A OF

00:18:15.194 --> 00:18:17.596
THE ESTIMATED SIX MILLION JEWS

00:18:17.663 --> 00:18:18.897
WHO WERE KILLED IN THE HOLOCAUST.

00:18:18.964 --> 00:18:20.866
WOMEN DEEMED CAPABLE OF WORKING

00:18:20.933 --> 00:18:22.434
WERE FORCED INTO DEPLORABLE

00:18:22.501 --> 00:18:24.770
WORKING CONDITIONS WHICH OFTEN

00:18:24.837 --> 00:18:26.071
THEMSELVES RESULTED IN THEIR%

00:18:26.138 --> 00:18:28.407
DEATHS PREGNANT WOMEN AND

00:18:28.474 --> 00:18:30.042
MOTHERS OF SMALL CHILDREN.

00:18:30.108 --> 00:18:32.311
WERE SEEN AS IN CAPABLE OF WORK

00:18:32.377 --> 00:18:32.911
AND WERE SENT TO THE KILLING

00:18:32.978 --> 00:18:35.214
CENTERS TO MEET WITH THE TRAGIC

00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:37.382
UNTIMELY DEATH IN THE HANDS.

00:18:37.449 --> 00:18:38.851
OF THE AGENTS OF THE GENOCIDE

00:18:38.917 --> 00:18:42.554
MANY THEIR WITH THEIR CHILDREN.

00:18:42.621 --> 00:18:44.456
SEEING THEIR CHILDREN COLLAPSE

00:18:44.523 --> 00:18:46.792
IN THE GAS CHAMBERS AND THEN

00:18:46.859 --> 00:18:48.727
THEY THEMSELVES DYING AT THE

00:18:48.794 --> 00:18:50.295
HANDS OF THESE.

00:18:50.362 --> 00:18:52.764
ATROCIOUS MURDERS.

00:18:52.831 --> 00:18:54.766
GERMAN PHYSICIANS AND MEDICAL

00:18:54.833 --> 00:18:56.768
RESEARCHERS TOOK ADVANTAGE OF

00:18:56.835 --> 00:18:58.470
JEWISH AND ROMA WOMEN AS

00:18:58.537 --> 00:19:00.606
SUBJECTS OF ON ETHICAL HUMAN

00:19:00.672 --> 00:19:02.541
EXPERIMENTATION INDEED DR

00:19:02.608 --> 00:19:04.243
MENGELE LAW WAS HISTORICALLY

00:19:04.309 --> 00:19:06.211
KNOWN AS SOMEONE FASCINATED BY

00:19:06.278 --> 00:19:07.813
TWINS.

00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:09.248
I HAD COUSINS APPARENTLY WHO

00:19:09.314 --> 00:19:11.483
WERE TWINS TWELVE YEAR OLD TWINS

00:19:11.550 --> 00:19:13.485

00:19:13.552 --> 00:19:15.187
EXPERIMENTS AND OF COURSE DIED

00:19:15.254 --> 00:19:16.522
IN THE PROCESS.

00:19:16.588 --> 00:19:17.623
BECAUSE HIS INTEREST HIS

00:19:17.689 --> 00:19:21.260
FASCINATION WASN'T WITH HUMANITY.

00:19:21.326 --> 00:19:22.694
IT WAS WITH HIS DISTORTED VIEW

00:19:22.761 --> 00:19:25.330
OF SCIENCE [inaudible]

00:19:25.397 --> 00:19:27.900
GERMAN PHYSICIANS.

00:19:27.966 --> 00:19:28.934
EXCUSE ME BEATINGS AND RAPE WERE

00:19:29.001 --> 00:19:30.636
ALSO COMMON OCCURRENCES IN

00:19:30.702 --> 00:19:33.238
GHETTOS AND CONCENTRATION CAMPS.

00:19:33.305 --> 00:19:34.339
BUT THESE WOMEN LIVING IN

00:19:34.406 --> 00:19:36.341
UNIMAGINABLE CONDITIONS WERE

00:19:36.408 --> 00:19:37.943
RESILIENT.

00:19:38.010 --> 00:19:39.378
MANY WOMEN IN CONCENTRATING

00:19:39.444 --> 00:19:40.879
CONCENTRATION CAMPS BANDED

00:19:40.946 --> 00:19:43.615
TOGETHER IN ORDER TO SURVIVE.

00:19:43.682 --> 00:19:45.117
IN POLAND SOME WOMEN SERVICE

00:19:45.183 --> 00:19:48.086
CAREERS OF INFORMATION TO CHOOSE

WHILE OTHERS TRIED TO RESIST

00:19:54.493 --> 00:19:56.428
WITHIN THE CONCENTRATION CAMPS

00:19:56.495 --> 00:19:57.629
HIMSELF.

00:19:57.696 --> 00:20:00.032
AT AUSCHWITZ. FIVE JEWISH WOMEN

00:20:00.098 --> 00:20:01.400
SUPPLIED THE GUN POWDER THAT

00:20:01.466 --> 00:20:03.335
MEMBERS OF THE JEWISH SPECIAL

00:20:03.402 --> 00:20:05.671
DETACHMENT AND AJ WHICH BIRKENAU.

00:20:05.737 --> 00:20:07.940

AND KILL SEVERAL SS MEN DURING

00:20:09.241 --> 00:20:12.945

00:38:43.487 --> 00:38:44.722
I DON'T CARE.

00:38:44.789 --> 00:38:46.624
WHAT WE LEARNED ARE IN THE

00:38:46.691 --> 00:38:47.925
COMMUNITY IN WHICH WE GREW AND

00:38:47.992 --> 00:38:50.027
WHAT WE LACKED IN TERMS OF REAL

00:38:50.094 --> 00:38:53.397
KNOWLEDGE AND HISTORY OUR HEARTS

00:38:53.464 --> 00:38:54.932

00:38:54.999 --> 00:38:56.200
OUR HEARTS ARE BIGGER THAN THAT

00:38:56.267 --> 00:38:58.302
WE ARE BETTER THAN THAT.

00:38:58.369 --> 00:39:00.137

00:39:13.651 --> 00:39:15.986
WE HAVE TO LET THAT ANGER MOVE

00:39:16.053 --> 00:39:19.090
US TO EXHIBIT THAT COURAGE. TO

00:39:19.156 --> 00:39:22.126

00:39:22.193 --> 00:39:23.527

00:39:23.594 --> 00:39:25.730
THIS IS NOT WHO WE ARE IN ANY

00:39:25.796 --> 00:39:27.832

00:39:27.898 --> 00:39:30.301
WE CAN DO BETTER.

00:39:30.367 --> 00:39:32.069
SO AS OUR HEARTS CONTINUE TO

00:39:32.136 --> 00:39:34.438
BREAK FOR YET ONE MORE FAMILY

00:39:34.505 --> 00:39:35.740
