DIRECTOR OF INITIATE JUSTICE AND

WE'RE AN ORGANIZATION THAT

ACTIVATES THE POLITICAL POWER

00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:50.675
PEOPLE DIRECTLY IMPACTED BY MASS

00:32:01.919 --> 00:32:02.787
THE REMOVAL OF THE RIGHT TO VOTE

00:32:02.854 --> 00:32:04.088
IS NOT BASED IN AN INTEREST IN

00:32:04.155 --> 00:32:05.590
PUBLIC SAFETY BUT IN A PUNITIVE

00:32:05.657 --> 00:32:07.292

DISENFRANCHISEMENT LAWS IN THE

WORLD ACCORDING TO HUMAN RIGHTS

00:32:21.506 --> 00:32:22.006
WATCH.

00:32:22.073 --> 00:32:23.708
AND REMAINS THE ONLY DEMOCRACY

00:32:23.775 --> 00:32:24.442
IN THE WORLD WHERE A CITIZEN

00:32:24.509 --> 00:32:26.711
COULD POTENTIALLY RECEIVE A

00:32:26.778 --> 00:32:27.779
LIFETIME BAN FROM VOTING.

00:32:27.845 --> 00:32:28.579
THESE RESTRICTIONS PERSISTS

00:32:28.646 --> 00:32:30.148
DESPITE THE FACT THE RESEARCH

00:32:30.214 --> 00:32:31.582
SHOWS THAT THE HARSHER VOTING

00:32:31.649 --> 00:32:33.251
RESTRICTIONS ARE THE HIGHER ARE

00:32:33.318 --> 00:32:34.319
THE RATES OF RECIDIVISM.

00:32:34.385 --> 00:32:36.254
A STUDY CONDUCTED BY UC BERKELEY

00:32:36.321 --> 00:32:37.655

FURTHER INCIDENCES OF CRIMINAL

00:32:44.696 --> 00:32:45.396
ACTIVITY.

00:32:45.463 --> 00:32:47.065
IF ONE HAS NO STAKE IN HIS OR

00:32:47.131 --> 00:32:48.299
HER COMMUNITY THEN ONE HAS

00:32:48.366 --> 00:32:49.767
LITTLE INCENTIVE TO BEHAVE IN A

00:32:49.834 --> 00:32:51.669
PRO SOCIAL MANNER OTHER THAN TO

00:32:51.736 --> 00:32:53.037
AVOID PUNISHMENT.

00:32:53.104 --> 00:32:54.172
A SIMILAR SURVEY CONDUCTED BY

PAROLE DIRECTLY SAID THE VOTING

00:33:08.152 --> 00:33:09.020
WOULD HELP THEM STAY OUT OF JAIL.

00:33:09.087 --> 00:33:10.154
MUCH OF THE REST OF THE COUNTRY

00:33:10.221 --> 00:33:11.155
IS MOVING TOWARD ENDING FELONY

00:33:11.222 --> 00:33:12.657
DISENFRANCHISEMENT AND IT'S TIME

00:33:12.724 --> 00:33:13.758
FOR CALIFORNIA TO BE PART OF

DEMOCRACY RESTORATION ACT WHICH

00:33:30.575 --> 00:33:31.476

00:48:30.574 --> 00:48:32.042
BIGGEST THING THAT HELPED THAT

FAMILY MEMBER WHEN HE GOT OUT

00:48:34.177 --> 00:48:36.380
WAS GAIN A GOOD JOB.

00:48:36.446 --> 00:48:37.681
A PRODUCTIVE JOB WASN'T A THE

00:48:37.748 --> 00:48:39.650
HIGHEST PAYING JOB BUT IT WAS A

00:48:39.716 --> 00:48:43.053

STRUCTURE TO HELP SUPPORT HIM --

00:48:48.125 --> 00:48:49.593
THOSE WERE THE THINGS THAT

00:48:49.660 --> 00:48:50.927
HELPED HIM GET BACK INTO A

00:48:50.994 --> 00:48:52.796
PRODUCTIVE LIFESTYLE MORE THAN

00:48:52.863 --> 00:48:53.830
ANYTHING ELSE I CAN TELL YOU

00:48:53.897 --> 00:48:55.465
WANT THEN THE THING THAT HE

00:48:55.532 --> 00:48:56.466
NEVER BROUGHT UP WAS.

00:48:56.533 --> 00:48:57.668

TALKED TO A TALK TO HIM ABOUT

00:49:06.009 --> 00:49:08.779
THIS YOU KNOW -- SO.

00:49:08.845 --> 00:49:10.314
BUT THOSE ARE THE TYPE WHEN WE

00:49:10.380 --> 00:49:11.548
TALK ABOUT RESTORED I WANT TO

00:49:11.615 --> 00:49:12.316
SAY THIS ABOUT RESTORATIVE

00:49:12.382 --> 00:49:13.717
JUSTICE BECAUSE IT GETS USED A

00:49:13.784 --> 00:49:15.152
LOT AROUND HERE.

00:49:15.218 --> 00:49:16.553
BUT THERE'S THINGS THAT ACTUALLY

00:49:16.620 --> 00:49:19.389
WORK -- AND THOSE ARE THE THINGS

00:49:19.456 --> 00:49:20.657
THAT I JUST TALKED ABOUT HAVING

00:49:20.724 --> 00:49:22.893
SUPPORT OF STRUCTURES HAVING THE

00:49:22.959 --> 00:49:24.961
ABILITY FOR EMPLOYMENT -- IN

00:49:25.028 --> 00:49:26.063
THESE ARE THINGS THAT THE STATE

00:49:26.129 --> 00:49:28.332
OF TEXAS ACTUALLY HAS DONE A

00:49:28.398 --> 00:49:30.300
REALLY GOOD JOB OF OF STARTING

00:49:30.367 --> 00:49:32.035
WITH PEOPLE WHILE THEY ARE IN

00:49:32.102 --> 00:49:33.804
INCARCERATED.

00:49:33.870 --> 00:49:35.339
BUILDING JOB SKILLS AND THEN

00:49:35.405 --> 00:49:36.606
HAVING A JOB THAT YOU CAN

00:49:36.673 --> 00:49:37.841
ACTUALLY GO INTO ONCE YOU GET

00:49:37.908 --> 00:49:38.842
OUT [inaudible]

00:49:38.909 --> 00:49:40.644
A PRISON.

00:49:40.711 --> 00:49:42.813
RIGHT OF OF HAVING RELATIONSHIPS

00:49:42.879 --> 00:49:44.381
WITH YOUR KIDS WHILE YOU'RE

00:49:44.448 --> 00:49:45.782
INCARCERATED.

00:49:45.849 --> 00:49:47.384
SO YOU CAN BE A GOOD FATHER THEM

00:49:47.451 --> 00:49:48.985
BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T HAVE THAT

00:49:49.052 --> 00:49:50.921
FATHER HOME.

00:49:50.987 --> 00:49:52.723
WHEN YOU WERE GROWING UP THOSE

00:49:52.789 --> 00:49:53.323
ARE THE KIND OF THINGS THAT

00:49:53.390 --> 00:49:54.257
REALLY MAKES?

00:49:54.324 --> 00:49:55.792
IT REALLY HELP RESTORE SOMEONE'S

00:49:55.859 --> 00:49:57.594
LIFE AND GET HIM BACK ON THE

00:49:57.661 --> 00:49:59.563
RIGHT TRACK HERE IN CALIFORNIA

00:49:59.629 --> 00:50:01.998
WHAT I SEE MOSTLY IS A LOT OF NO

00:50:02.065 --> 00:50:03.767
ACCOUNTABILITY.

00:50:03.834 --> 00:50:05.469
AND JUST LET PEOPLE OUT WITHOUT

00:50:05.535 --> 00:50:06.870
THAT.

00:50:06.937 --> 00:50:08.205
LET PEOPLE NOT SERVE THEIR FULL

00:50:08.271 --> 00:50:10.140
SENTENCES.

00:50:10.207 --> 00:50:12.776
RESTORE RESTORE BENEFITS WITHOUT

00:50:12.843 --> 00:50:15.679
HAVING THAT ACCOUNTABILITY. ONE

00:50:15.746 --> 00:50:16.813
OH NINE HAS DONE THAT WE'VE

00:50:16.880 --> 00:50:17.748
ESSENTIALLY JUST WASHED OUR

00:50:17.814 --> 00:50:19.316
HANDS IT'S AN PRIMARILY NOT

00:50:19.383 --> 00:50:21.651
BECAUSE WE CARE SO MUCH ABOUT

00:50:21.718 --> 00:50:23.053
THE PEOPLE THERE INCARCERATED

00:50:23.120 --> 00:50:24.888
BUT BECAUSE IT'S EXPENSIVE TO

00:50:24.955 --> 00:50:26.356
HOUSE THEM IN STATE PRISON.

00:50:26.423 --> 00:50:27.924
AND BECAUSE WE HAVE LAWSUITS AND

00:50:27.991 --> 00:50:29.393
WE BASICALLY JUST WASH THEIR

00:50:29.459 --> 00:50:30.627
HANDS AND SAID GO ON OUT

00:50:30.694 --> 00:50:32.262
HOPEFULLY YOU DON'T VICTIMIZE

00:50:32.329 --> 00:50:33.830
PEOPLE AGAIN.

00:50:33.897 --> 00:50:35.365
THAT'S WHAT WE'VE DONE SO DON'T

00:50:35.432 --> 00:50:36.733
CALL THAT RESTORATIVE JUSTICE

00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:38.235
YOU KNOW LET'S TALK ABOUT THINGS

00:50:38.301 --> 00:50:40.537
THAT REALLY HELP PEOPLE.

00:50:40.604 --> 00:50:41.171
GET BACK ON A PRODUCTIVE TRACK I

00:50:41.238 --> 00:50:42.439
HAVE.

00:50:42.506 --> 00:50:44.408
YOU HAVE A POWERFUL STORY SIR IN

00:50:44.474 --> 00:50:46.343
AND WHAT I HEARD IT LAST TIME IT

00:50:46.410 --> 00:50:47.911
TOUCH ME IT REALLY DOES AND I

00:50:47.978 --> 00:50:49.546
WANT YOU. TO BE ABLE TO

00:50:49.613 --> 00:50:53.350
PARTICIPATE IN THIS DEMOCRACY --

00:50:53.417 --> 00:50:54.918
BUT YOU DO HAVE TO FINISH.

00:50:54.985 --> 00:50:57.721
YOUR FULL TERM AND I THINK POLL

00:50:57.788 --> 00:50:59.456
IS PART OF THAT.

00:50:59.523 --> 00:51:00.424
AND I THINK THAT'S WHY WE HAVE

00:51:00.490 --> 00:51:02.259
THIS RULE.

00:51:02.325 --> 00:51:03.693
IN PLACE IN THE FIRST PLACE LET

00:51:03.760 --> 00:51:05.395
ME SAY SOMETHING ABOUT RESIDENT

00:51:05.462 --> 00:51:07.264
RECIDIVISM -- BECAUSE A LOT OF

00:51:07.330 --> 00:51:08.565
PEOPLE SAID -- THIS HELPS REDUCE

00:51:08.632 --> 00:51:10.867
RECIDIVISM RATES THE ONLY THING

00:51:10.934 --> 00:51:12.702
AND THEY POINT TO AS FLORIDA.

00:51:12.769 --> 00:51:15.472
AND IN THAT CASE FLORIDA HAD A

00:51:15.539 --> 00:51:16.239
PROCESS WHERE YOU HAD TO

00:51:16.306 --> 00:51:18.208
PETITION THE GOVERNOR TO GET

00:51:18.275 --> 00:51:19.543
YOUR VOTING RIGHTS RESTORED.

00:51:19.609 --> 00:51:20.911
AND OUT OF THE THOUSANDS OF

00:51:20.977 --> 00:51:22.312
PEOPLE THAT PETITIONED.

00:51:22.379 --> 00:51:24.347
ONLY A VERY SMALL PERCENTAGE

00:51:24.414 --> 00:51:25.916
ACTUALLY GOT THEIR RIGHTS

00:51:25.982 --> 00:51:27.651
RESTORED AND THEY ESSENTIALLY

00:51:27.717 --> 00:51:29.152
RESTORED RISE TO PEOPLE WHO HAD

00:51:29.219 --> 00:51:30.153
A LOWER.

00:51:30.220 --> 00:51:34.224
RISK OF BEING OF OF RE OFFENDING.

00:51:34.291 --> 00:51:36.960
AND SO THAT'S NOT REALLY A GOOD.

00:51:37.027 --> 00:51:38.328
PULLED TO TAKE FROM AND SAY HEY

00:51:38.395 --> 00:51:40.497
THAT THAT'S PROOF THAT IT

00:51:40.564 --> 00:51:41.932
REDUCES RECIDIVISM RATES.

00:51:41.998 --> 00:51:43.200
AND THAT'S REALLY THE ONLY STUDY

00:51:43.266 --> 00:51:44.835
THAT'S BEEN POINTED TO AS

00:51:44.901 --> 00:51:46.169
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PROCESS

00:51:46.236 --> 00:51:47.537
THAN WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

00:51:47.604 --> 00:51:50.340
WHICH IS THIS FOR RESTORATION.

00:51:50.407 --> 00:51:52.476
WITHOUT A PETITION ANYBODY

00:51:52.542 --> 00:51:52.776
[inaudible]

00:51:52.843 --> 00:51:54.311
AND SO.

00:51:54.377 --> 00:51:56.012
LOOK I DON'T WE DON'T.

00:51:56.079 --> 00:51:57.848
I SEE I I FEEL LIKE WE A LITTLE

00:51:57.914 --> 00:51:59.950
BIT UNDERSCORE THIS BECAUSE VERY

00:52:00.016 --> 00:52:02.619
POWERFUL STORY AGAIN I BELIEVE.

00:52:02.686 --> 00:52:04.588
IN THE ABILITY TO GET.

00:52:04.654 --> 00:52:06.756
YOUR RIGHTS BACK AND TO GET BACK

00:52:06.823 --> 00:52:08.391
ON THE RIGHT TRACK.

00:52:08.458 --> 00:52:11.862
AFTER YOU'VE COMPLETED PAROLE --

00:52:11.928 --> 00:52:13.797
BUT LET'S NOT UNDERSCORE WHAT

00:52:13.864 --> 00:52:15.131
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

00:52:15.198 --> 00:52:16.600
THESE ARE FELONIES OKAY THAT

00:52:16.666 --> 00:52:18.702
INCLUDES MURDER THAT INCLUDES

00:52:18.768 --> 00:52:20.370
RAPE THAT INCLUDES SERIOUS

00:52:20.437 --> 00:52:22.239
ASSAULTS ON PEOPLE DOMESTIC

00:52:22.305 --> 00:52:23.807
VIOLENCE.

00:52:23.874 --> 00:52:25.208
OKAY AND SO LET'S NOT UNDERSCORE

00:52:25.275 --> 00:52:27.244
IN THE CASE OF MURDER THAT

00:52:27.310 --> 00:52:28.545
PERSON NEVER GETS TO VOTE AGAIN

00:52:28.612 --> 00:52:28.845
[inaudible]

00:52:28.912 --> 00:52:30.580
THEY'RE GONE.

00:52:30.647 --> 00:52:31.781
WE DON'T SEE THEM AGAIN THEY

00:52:31.848 --> 00:52:33.083
DON'T HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO

00:52:33.149 --> 00:52:35.185
PARTICIPATE IN THIS DEMOCRACY.

00:52:35.252 --> 00:52:36.653
THAT WAS TAKEN AWAY BECAUSE

00:52:36.720 --> 00:52:38.688
WHOEVER THE OFFENDER WAS.

00:52:38.755 --> 00:52:40.790
VIOLATED THEIR RIGHTS VIOLATED

00:52:40.857 --> 00:52:42.659
OUR LAWS SHOWED NO RESPECT FOR

00:52:42.726 --> 00:52:44.461
OUR DEMOCRACY IN OUR IN THE RULE

00:52:44.528 --> 00:52:45.262
OF LAW.

00:52:45.328 --> 00:52:47.097
IN VIOLATED THE LAW THEY DID DO

00:52:47.163 --> 00:52:48.598
THAT.

00:52:48.665 --> 00:52:50.467
OKAY SOMEONE WHO'S BEEN RAPED

00:52:50.534 --> 00:52:53.670
THEY HAVE THAT FOR THE REST OF

00:52:53.737 --> 00:52:55.038
THEIR LIFE.

00:52:55.105 --> 00:52:58.241
DOESN'T GO AWAY.

00:52:58.308 --> 00:53:00.010
SO THOSE VICTIMS HAVE TO LIVE

00:53:00.076 --> 00:53:01.344
WITH THIS STUFF THE REST OF

00:53:01.411 --> 00:53:03.146

00:53:05.215 --> 00:53:06.616
BEEN WHO HAVE COMMITTED THOSE

00:53:06.683 --> 00:53:09.553
CRIMES. TO BE ACCOUNTABLE AND

00:53:09.619 --> 00:53:11.021
PAY A SENSE FOR THAT AND AND

00:53:11.087 --> 00:53:11.988
WHILE YOU'RE PAYING THAT

00:53:16.526 --> 00:53:18.528
REASONABLE CONSIDERING THE

OF THE THE ANALYSIS ON THIS THIS

00:54:55.592 --> 00:54:58.028
BILL AND SO IT SEEMS.

00:54:58.094 --> 00:55:00.330
THAT ALL OVER THE COUNTRY --

00:55:00.397 --> 00:55:02.565
THERE'S SORT OF A MIXED BAG --

00:55:02.632 --> 00:55:04.034
BUT LOOKS LIKE.

00:55:04.100 --> 00:55:08.972
AND BOTH MAINE AND VERMONT --

00:55:09.039 --> 00:55:11.241

LOOKS LIKE -- THAT IN TWENTY TWO

00:55:21.217 --> 00:55:22.952
STATES FELONS WHO THEY'RE VOTING

00:55:23.019 --> 00:55:24.020
RIGHTS DURING INCARCERATION FOR

00:55:24.087 --> 00:55:25.689
A PERIOD OF TIME AFTER THAT

00:55:25.755 --> 00:55:28.858
TYPICALLY WHILE ON PRO A PAROLE

00:55:28.925 --> 00:55:29.993
OR PROBATION.

00:55:30.060 --> 00:55:31.594
I STRUGGLE LITTLE BIT WITH THIS

00:55:31.661 --> 00:55:32.629
ALL UP I'LL TELL YA BECAUSE I DO

00:55:32.696 --> 00:55:34.097
ALSO BELIEVE IN -- WRIT

00:55:34.164 --> 00:55:36.900
RESTORATIVE JUSTICE -- AND WHEN

00:55:36.966 --> 00:55:38.034
I THINK ABOUT THIS FROM A

00:55:38.101 --> 00:55:39.769
LOGICAL PERSPECTIVE AND I THINK

00:55:39.836 --> 00:55:40.904
ABOUT.

00:55:40.970 --> 00:55:42.038
WHAT WHAT IS THE RIGHT TO VOTE

00:55:42.105 --> 00:55:43.473
ACTUALLY MEANS AND THE GENTLEMAN

00:55:43.540 --> 00:55:44.708
WAS TALKING ABOUT THAT WE ARE

00:55:44.774 --> 00:55:45.942
REPUBLICAN NOT A DEMOCRACY I

00:55:46.009 --> 00:55:47.410
THINK WE HAVE TO WE CAN'T FORGET

00:55:47.477 --> 00:55:48.978
THAT A REPUBLIC IS ACTUALLY?

00:55:49.045 --> 00:55:51.214
A FORM OF OF OF OF DEMOCRACY --

00:55:51.281 --> 00:55:54.584
THE BUT IT IS STILL A DEMOCRACY --

00:55:54.651 --> 00:55:56.352
THE YOU CAN'T FORGET THAT A SORT

00:55:56.419 --> 00:55:57.754
OF THE CORE FOUNDING OF OUR OF

00:55:57.821 --> 00:55:59.322
OUR CONSTITUTION IS YOU KNOW WE

00:55:59.389 --> 00:56:01.958
THE PEOPLE -- AND IT IS -- WE

00:56:02.025 --> 00:56:03.960
THE PEOPLE -- THAT ULTIMATELY

00:56:04.027 --> 00:56:06.129
ARE ARE THE DECIDER -- THIS

00:56:06.196 --> 00:56:08.832
QUESTION THAT COMES BEFORE US --

00:56:08.898 --> 00:56:10.600
IS ONE THAT HAS TO BE ANSWERED

00:56:10.667 --> 00:56:11.935
CONSTITUTIONALLY A BECAUSE IN

00:56:12.001 --> 00:56:14.471
CALIFORNIA -- IT SAYS THAT -- IF

00:56:14.537 --> 00:56:16.372
YOU'RE ON PAROLED YOU'RE NOT

00:56:16.439 --> 00:56:17.874
ABLE TO TO VOTE.

00:56:17.941 --> 00:56:19.075
BUT YOU'RE ALSO THOUGH -- IF

00:56:19.142 --> 00:56:23.646
YOU'RE ON PROBATION YOU ARE

00:56:23.713 --> 00:56:25.048
RIGHT.

00:56:25.115 --> 00:56:26.349
I DON'T KNOW NOT SURE EXACTLY

00:56:26.416 --> 00:56:27.484
BECAUSE I'M NOT AN ATTORNEY AND

00:56:27.550 --> 00:56:28.084
I'M NOT IN A CRIMINAL LAW BUT

00:56:28.151 --> 00:56:29.352
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PROBATION

00:56:29.419 --> 00:56:32.489
AND AND AND AND PAROLE OF MAYBE

00:56:32.555 --> 00:56:33.523
ONE OF YOU GUYS WANT TO ADDRESS

00:56:33.590 --> 00:56:34.858
THAT.

00:56:34.924 --> 00:56:38.628
THE THE THE END THE BILL BEFORE

00:56:38.695 --> 00:56:39.696
US DUMB.

00:56:39.763 --> 00:56:41.231
IS NOT A VOTE TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO

00:56:41.297 --> 00:56:42.432
BE ABLE TO OF THOSE WHO ARE ON

00:56:42.499 --> 00:56:43.733
PAROLE TO BE ABLE TO VOTE.

00:56:43.800 --> 00:56:45.068
THE BILL BEFORE US IS A

00:56:45.135 --> 00:56:46.136
CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT THAT

00:56:46.202 --> 00:56:47.036
WILL ALLOW THE PEOPLE OF

00:56:47.103 --> 00:56:49.272
CALIFORNIA TO BE ABLE TO MAKE

00:56:49.339 --> 00:56:52.842
THAT DECISION -- AND FOR THAT

00:56:52.909 --> 00:56:54.677
REASON I'M GONNA SUPPORT THIS --

00:56:54.744 --> 00:56:56.379
EVEN THOUGH I'M NOT SURE WHEN IT

00:56:56.446 --> 00:56:57.814
COMES BEFORE ME AT THE BALLOT --

00:56:57.881 --> 00:56:59.282
HOW I'M GOING TO BE ABLE TO VOTE

00:56:59.349 --> 00:57:01.551
I WOULD LEAN TOWARDS TOWARDS YES

00:57:01.618 --> 00:57:02.752
BUT I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE YET

00:57:02.819 --> 00:57:04.721
BECAUSE I HAVEN'T GOTTEN THERE I

00:57:04.788 --> 00:57:07.023
THINK THAT BECAUSE THIS QUESTION --

00:57:07.090 --> 00:57:08.658
IS IS A MIXED BAG ACROSS THE

00:57:08.725 --> 00:57:10.326
COUNTRY AND I THINK THAT THE

00:57:10.393 --> 00:57:12.295
RIGHT TO BE ABLE TO VOTE IS SO

00:57:12.362 --> 00:57:14.831
POWERFUL BECAUSE AT SOME MOMENT

00:57:14.898 --> 00:57:16.099
IN TIME IN HISTORY.

00:57:16.166 --> 00:57:18.034
ANY LEGISLATURE CAN DECIDE

00:57:18.101 --> 00:57:19.736
VARIOUS THINGS -- ARE ILLEGAL

00:57:19.803 --> 00:57:21.371
AND YOU CAN HAVE TO SERVE A

00:57:21.437 --> 00:57:23.206
PRISON SENTENCE AND A STRIP YOU

00:57:23.273 --> 00:57:24.574
OF THAT ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO TO

00:57:24.641 --> 00:57:26.176
VOTE AND NOT HAVE A VOICE IN

00:57:26.242 --> 00:57:29.145
YOUR DEMOCRACY -- IS -- IS IS

00:57:29.212 --> 00:57:31.080
TOO MUCH FOR US TO BE ABLE TO TO

00:57:31.147 --> 00:57:32.715
GIVE AWAY I THINK THIS QUESTION

00:57:32.782 --> 00:57:34.083
I'M SHOULD GO BEFORE OF THE

00:57:34.150 --> 00:57:36.953
VOTERS -- AND I'LL BE SUPPORTING

NOT DECIDING WE'RE GOING TO DO

00:58:08.551 --> 00:58:09.919
TODAY WE'RE DECIDING TO PUT IT

00:58:09.986 --> 00:58:11.588
ON THE BALLOT BECAUSE THE STATE

00:58:11.654 --> 00:58:12.422
CONSTITUTION SAYS THAT THE

00:58:12.488 --> 00:58:13.289
LEGISLATURE.

00:58:13.356 --> 00:58:14.591
CAN'T MAKE THIS CHANGE WE HAVE

00:58:14.657 --> 00:58:16.826

ON THAT ON THIS ISSUE AND I

00:58:21.898 --> 00:58:22.498
THINK IT'S THE RIGHT COURSE TO

00:58:22.565 --> 00:58:24.267
DO AT THIS IS THE ELECTIONS

00:58:24.334 --> 00:58:25.501
COMMITTEE NOT THE PUBLIC SAFETY

00:58:25.568 --> 00:58:26.569
COMMITTEE.

00:58:26.636 --> 00:58:28.438
I'M NOT A PUBLIC SAFETY EXPERT

00:58:28.504 --> 00:58:30.306
EITHER BY THINK WANT TO CLARIFY

00:58:30.373 --> 00:58:32.742
ONE THING ABOUT PEARL -- PAROLE.

00:58:32.809 --> 00:58:35.478
IS IS NOT PUNISHMENT.

00:58:35.545 --> 00:58:36.779
THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN PAROLED

00:58:36.846 --> 00:58:38.481
HAD BEEN DEEMED BY THE PAROLE

00:58:38.548 --> 00:58:41.284
BOARD THAT THEY IF THEY'RE SAFE

00:58:41.351 --> 00:58:42.752
TO RETURN TO SOCIETY THEY SERVE

00:58:42.819 --> 00:58:45.321
A NOT FOR THEIR PRISON SENTENCE.

00:58:45.388 --> 00:58:46.256
TO TO WARRANT THE PUNISHMENT

00:58:46.322 --> 00:58:48.024
THAT WAS BROUGHT UPON THEM BY

00:58:48.091 --> 00:58:50.093
THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM A PAROLE IS

00:58:50.159 --> 00:58:51.628
ABOUT RE INTEGRATING AND

00:58:51.694 --> 00:58:53.263
SUPPORTING PEOPLE BACK INTO

LEGAL MINORS AND THAT DEFINITION

01:14:03.172 --> 01:14:04.139
CHILDREN.

01:14:04.206 --> 01:14:05.674
THEY ARE ALMOST ALWAYS STILL

01:14:05.741 --> 01:14:07.176
LIVING AT HOME WITH UNDER THE

01:14:07.242 --> 01:14:08.477
STRONG INFLUENCE OF THEIR

01:14:08.544 --> 01:14:10.145
PARENTS AND THIS IS NOT

01:14:10.212 --> 01:14:11.446
CONDUCTIVE TO INDEPENDENT

01:14:11.513 --> 01:14:12.014
THOUGHT.

01:14:13.615 --> 01:14:15.184
PRESSURE FROM THEIR IMMEDIATE

01:14:15.250 --> 01:14:16.218
SUPERIORS.

01:14:16.285 --> 01:14:18.453
SITUATION IS EXACERBATED BY THE

01:14:18.520 --> 01:14:20.622
FACT THAT OVER 75% OF THE

01:14:20.689 --> 01:14:22.424
CALIFORNIA VOTERS ARE VOTING

01:14:22.491 --> 01:14:23.959
WITH MAIL IN BALLOTS.

01:14:24.026 --> 01:14:25.127
AND THAT THE SAME PERCENTAGE

01:14:25.194 --> 01:14:27.596
WOULD LOGICALLY APPLY TO

01:14:27.663 --> 01:14:28.197
SEVENTEEN YEAR OLDS WOULD BE

01:14:28.263 --> 01:14:29.364
VOTERS.

01:14:29.431 --> 01:14:30.532
THEREFORE THESE CHILDREN WITH

01:14:30.599 --> 01:14:32.935
THE MAKING THEIR BALLOTS AT

01:14:33.001 --> 01:14:33.569
MARKING YOUR BALLOTS AND HOME

01:14:33.635 --> 01:14:35.404
WHAT PLATE PROBABLY UNDER THE

01:14:35.470 --> 01:14:37.372
DIRECT ASSISTANCE OF ADULTS.

01:14:37.439 --> 01:14:39.675
AND THEIR ENVIRONMENT AND THEY

01:14:39.741 --> 01:14:40.442
WOULD BE GUARANTEED.

01:14:40.509 --> 01:14:42.144
AND THAT WOULD NOT BE GUARANTEED

01:14:42.211 --> 01:14:43.512
THE FREEDOM TO VOTE

01:14:43.579 --> 01:14:45.414
INDEPENDENTLY AND EXPRESS THEIR

01:14:45.480 --> 01:14:46.615
OWN CONSCIENCE.

01:14:46.682 --> 01:14:48.517
THE SEVENTEEN YEAR OLDS WILL

01:14:48.584 --> 01:14:50.452
ALMOST ALWAYS BE A STILL IN HIGH

01:14:50.519 --> 01:14:52.287

01:14:52.354 --> 01:14:53.922
INFLUENCE OF THEIR TEACHERS.

01:14:53.989 --> 01:14:55.424
THIS WILL AGAIN MAKE IT LESS

01:14:55.490 --> 01:14:56.491
LIKELY THAT THEY WOULD BE

01:14:56.558 --> 01:14:57.593
EXPRESSING THEIR OWN

01:14:57.659 --> 01:14:58.894
INDEPENDENTLY THOUGHT OUT

01:14:58.961 --> 01:15:00.562
CHOICES.

01:15:00.629 --> 01:15:01.930
THAT THEY WILL.

01:15:01.997 --> 01:15:03.365
BE ALLOWED TO VOTE.

01:15:03.432 --> 01:15:04.900
NOW THAT CALIFORNIA HAS MOVED

01:15:04.967 --> 01:15:07.269
ITS PRIMARY DATE TO EARLY MARCH

01:15:07.336 --> 01:15:08.770
THERE ARE EIGHT MONTHS BETWEEN

01:15:08.837 --> 01:15:10.272
THE PRIMARY AND THE GENERAL

01:15:10.339 --> 01:15:11.540
ELECTION.

01:15:11.607 --> 01:15:13.475
CONSIDERING MATURATION THAT CAN

01:15:13.542 --> 01:15:15.210
BE PLACED CAN TAKE PLACE IN THAT

01:15:15.277 --> 01:15:16.745
AMOUNT OF TIME FOR PEOPLE IN

01:15:16.812 --> 01:15:17.913
THEIR LATE TEENS.

01:15:17.980 --> 01:15:19.615
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SEVENTEEN

01:15:19.681 --> 01:15:21.049
YEAR OLD AN EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD

01:15:21.116 --> 01:15:22.951
CAN BE ASTONISHING ANY PARENT OF

01:15:23.018 --> 01:15:24.253
A HIGH SCHOOL OR HIGH SCHOOL

01:15:24.319 --> 01:15:26.622
TEACHER CAN VERIFY THAT TRUTH.

01:15:26.688 --> 01:15:27.923
ADDING TO THE STRING OF

01:15:27.990 --> 01:15:32.694
OPPOSITION TO A CA.

01:15:32.761 --> 01:15:33.328
FOR ADD TO THAT THE FACT THAT

01:15:33.395 --> 01:15:33.929
EIGHTEEN YEAR OLDS WILL ALMOST

01:15:33.996 --> 01:15:35.564
ALWAYS BE IN HIGH SCHOOL THE

01:15:35.631 --> 01:15:36.999
HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES BY THE BY

EARN THEIR WAY IN THE WORLD ARE

01:15:41.937 --> 01:15:43.438
BEGINNING TO PREPARE FOR A

01:15:43.505 --> 01:15:45.307
FUTURE CAREER BI VOCATIONAL

01:15:45.374 --> 01:15:47.442
TRAINING OR ENROLLMENT IN AN

01:15:47.509 --> 01:15:49.278
INSTITUTION OF HIGHER LEARNING.

01:15:49.344 --> 01:15:50.712
THIS ENTRANCE INTO REAL LIFE

01:15:50.779 --> 01:15:52.981
CREATES A SOBERING AND MATURING

01:15:53.048 --> 01:15:55.117
AFFECT THAT SEVENTEEN YEAR OLDS

01:15:55.183 --> 01:15:56.551
WILL NOT HAVE EXPERIENCED.

01:15:56.618 --> 01:15:57.920
MOST WILL SEE THE WORLD

01:15:57.986 --> 01:16:00.555
DIFFERENTLY MORE RESPONSIBLY AND

01:16:00.622 --> 01:16:02.124
WILL FEEL MORE EXPERIENCED.

01:16:02.190 --> 01:16:04.293
MOST WILL SEE THE WORLD OF OKAY

01:16:04.359 --> 01:16:06.295
WHAT MORE OWNERSHIP OF THEIR OWN

01:16:06.361 --> 01:16:08.764
LIVES AND THEIR POLITICAL

01:16:08.830 --> 01:16:10.232
DECISIONS THAT AFFECT THEM.

01:16:10.299 --> 01:16:11.967
ONLY WHEN PEOPLE REACH THAT

01:16:12.034 --> 01:16:15.370
STAGE CAN NAY CAST AN EDUCATED

01:16:15.437 --> 01:16:16.305
VOTE.

01:16:16.371 --> 01:16:17.506
THERE ARE NO LEGITIMATE REASONS

01:16:17.572 --> 01:16:19.207
TO EXTEND THE VOTING RIGHT TO

01:16:19.274 --> 01:16:20.909
LEGALLY TO MINORS AND MANY

01:16:20.976 --> 01:16:23.378
SCIENTIFIC AND LOGICAL REGION'S

01:16:23.445 --> 01:16:24.947
REASONS NOT.

01:16:25.013 --> 01:16:26.782
TO I WOULD LIKE TO ADD A COUPLE

01:16:26.848 --> 01:16:28.517
PERSONAL THOUGHTS OF I

01:16:28.583 --> 01:16:30.485
REGISTERED TO VOTE.

01:16:30.552 --> 01:16:33.755
OF IN THE DAYS OF THE ALBATROSS

01:16:33.822 --> 01:16:36.024
WHEN I WAS.

01:16:36.091 --> 01:16:36.625
TWENTY ONE THAT WAS THE VOTING

01:16:36.692 --> 01:16:38.327
AGE THEN -- DURING THE VIETNAM

01:16:38.393 --> 01:16:41.196
WAR THEY LOWERED THE VOTING AGE.

01:16:41.263 --> 01:16:44.499
TO EIGHTEEN AND THE REASON FOR

01:16:44.566 --> 01:16:46.134
EIGHTEEN YEAR OLDS THAT WERE

01:16:46.201 --> 01:16:48.503
DRAFTED INTO THE ARMY -- M. WERE

01:16:48.570 --> 01:16:50.272
RISKING THEIR LIFE AND LIMB FOR

01:16:50.339 --> 01:16:53.508
OUR COUNTRY SO OF COURSE THEY

01:16:53.575 --> 01:16:55.277
THEY DESERVE THE RIGHT TO VOTE.

01:16:55.344 --> 01:16:58.146
AFTER THE WAR THAT THAT EIGHTEEN

01:16:58.213 --> 01:16:59.648
YEAR OLD AGE SO STOOD.

01:16:59.715 --> 01:17:01.083

01:20:15.210 --> 01:20:16.611
ABOUT MY OWN HISTORY.

01:20:16.678 --> 01:20:18.213
I WAS THE FIRST MILLENNIAL EVER

THEN WHEN I RAN ICE I RECEIVED

01:20:24.319 --> 01:20:25.887
THE SAME ARGUMENTS THAT I WAS

01:20:25.954 --> 01:20:27.055
TOO YOUNG AND CAPABLE OF SERVING

01:20:27.122 --> 01:20:28.089
IN THE POSITION.

01:20:28.156 --> 01:20:29.324
THAT I AM IN BUT YET THAT HASN'T

01:20:29.391 --> 01:20:30.825
STOPPED ME FROM CONTINUING TO BE

LEGISLATURE I GREW UP WITH A

01:20:36.665 --> 01:20:38.433
FAMILY THAT WAS POLITICALLY

01:20:38.500 --> 01:20:39.901
ACTIVE IT WAS.

01:20:39.968 --> 01:20:41.870
AN HONOR TO BE ABLE TO REGISTER

01:20:41.937 --> 01:20:43.672
TO VOTE I VOTED IN EVERY SINGLE

01:20:43.738 --> 01:20:46.474
ELECTION EVER SINCE THEN AND IT

01:20:46.541 --> 01:20:48.543
HAS MOTIVATED TO STAY ENGAGED TO

01:20:48.610 --> 01:20:50.445
PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT'S GOING ON

01:20:50.512 --> 01:20:51.580
TO BE HONEST WITH YOU.

01:20:51.646 --> 01:20:52.948
I NEVER THOUGHT I'D EVER RUN FOR

01:20:53.014 --> 01:20:54.316
POLITICAL OFFICE BUT THE MORE I

01:20:54.382 --> 01:20:55.850
LEARN THE MORE I WAS ENGAGED TO

01:20:55.917 --> 01:20:56.851
MORE AYE VOTE IN.

01:20:56.918 --> 01:20:57.986
THE MORE I KNEW THAT MY

01:20:58.053 --> 01:21:00.121
PERSPECTIVE IN MY GENERATIONS

01:21:00.188 --> 01:21:01.890
VIEW WAS NOT BEING REPRESENTED

01:21:01.957 --> 01:21:03.858
IN GOVERNMENT AND IT IS BECAUSE

01:21:03.925 --> 01:21:04.993
OF THAT.

01:21:05.060 --> 01:21:07.629
LACK OF PARTICIPATION BY OUR

01:21:07.696 --> 01:21:09.164
GENERATION IS THE REASON WHY

01:21:09.231 --> 01:21:10.265
WE'RE IN REALLY IN MY OPINION

01:21:10.332 --> 01:21:12.067
SUCH A TERRIBLE POSITION TODAY

01:21:12.133 --> 01:21:13.702
LOOK AT OUR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.

01:21:13.768 --> 01:21:14.603
LOOK AT THE PEOPLE THAT ARE

01:21:14.669 --> 01:21:16.204
RUNNING OUR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

01:21:16.271 --> 01:21:18.473
IT'S A DISASTER AN ABSOLUTE

01:21:18.540 --> 01:21:19.841
DISASTER.

01:21:19.908 --> 01:21:20.809
AND IT ISN'T AND IT ISN'T

01:21:20.875 --> 01:21:22.177
BECAUSE OF ANYTHING ELSE OTHER

01:21:22.244 --> 01:21:23.578
THAN THE FACT THAT THESE PEOPLE

01:21:23.645 --> 01:21:24.546
HAVE JUST BEEN THERE FOR TOO

01:21:24.613 --> 01:21:25.914
LONG AND THEY THINK THAT THEY'RE

01:21:25.981 --> 01:21:27.415
THE ONLY ONES THAT MATTER

01:21:27.482 --> 01:21:28.617
THEY'RE THE ONLY VOICES THAT

01:21:28.683 --> 01:21:28.984
MATTER.

01:21:29.050 --> 01:21:31.286
WHEN WE'RE GENERATION AS COSTLY

01:21:31.353 --> 01:21:32.754
BEEN TOLD YOU'RE NOT YOU'RE NOT

01:21:32.821 --> 01:21:34.756
SMART ENOUGH YOU CAN PARTICIPATE

01:21:34.823 --> 01:21:35.690
YOU JUST LISTENING TO WHAT

01:21:35.757 --> 01:21:36.524
YOU'RE TOLD?

01:21:36.591 --> 01:21:38.660
AND I DISAGREE WITH THAT I THINK

01:21:38.727 --> 01:21:40.695
THAT THAT IS WHY WE ARE SUCH AN

01:21:40.762 --> 01:21:42.063
IN SUCH A TOUGH PLACE AS A

01:21:42.130 --> 01:21:43.565
COUNTRY THE ONLY WORK WAY WE'RE

01:21:43.632 --> 01:21:45.333
GOING TO BE ABLE TO CHANGE THAT.

01:21:45.400 --> 01:21:46.568
AND RECTIFY THE RECTIFY THE

01:21:46.635 --> 01:21:47.636
SITUATION THAT WE'RE IN THIS

01:21:47.702 --> 01:21:49.304
COUNTRY IS BY HAVING A

01:21:49.371 --> 01:21:51.006
PERSPECTIVE FROM THE NEXT

01:21:51.072 --> 01:21:51.640
GENERATION THE PEOPLE THAT ARE

01:21:51.706 --> 01:21:54.676
GONNA BE FORCED TO LIVE UNDER

01:21:54.743 --> 01:21:56.144
THAT THE POLICIES.

01:21:56.211 --> 01:21:58.380
THAT ARE BEING PASSED TODAY

01:21:58.446 --> 01:22:01.049
BECAUSE WE ON THOUGH IN THIS

01:22:01.116 --> 01:22:02.884

BE ABLE TO HAVE A VOICE.

01:22:12.193 --> 01:22:13.695
IN THAT AND THE IDEA THAT WE

01:22:15.330 --> 01:22:15.864

ACTUALLY WANT TO TALK A LITTLE

BIT ABOUT THE MISTER CALDERON --

01:23:47.689 --> 01:23:49.958
HE WAS -- OUT MUCH MORE TALENTED

01:23:50.024 --> 01:23:51.826
THAN HI HE GOT ELECTED TO THE

I GOT I WAS VERY YOUNG AND VERY

01:24:01.936 --> 01:24:03.271
ENGAGED IN.

01:24:03.338 --> 01:24:06.307
THE PROCESS -- EARLY ON ACTUALLY

01:24:06.374 --> 01:24:07.509
A GRADUATE FROM HIGH SCHOOL A

01:24:07.575 --> 01:24:08.610
MONTH AFTER MY SIXTEENTH

01:24:08.676 --> 01:24:09.844
BIRTHDAY SKIPPED A COUPLE OF

01:24:09.911 --> 01:24:11.780
GRADES -- SO I WAS DONE I WAS IN

01:24:11.846 --> 01:24:13.848
COLLEGE -- AT SIXTEEN YEARS OLD

01:24:13.915 --> 01:24:15.683
AMID FINISHED ON MY FIRST TWO

01:24:15.750 --> 01:24:17.952
YEARS BEFORE I HAD -- BECOME

01:24:18.019 --> 01:24:19.053
EIGHTEEN I THINK I HAD WHEN I

01:24:19.120 --> 01:24:20.221
WAS SIXTEEN OR SEVENTEEN YEARS

01:24:20.288 --> 01:24:22.791
OLD I THINK I HAD THE SMARTS --

01:24:22.857 --> 01:24:26.728
TO BE ABLE TO A TO VOTE AND YET

01:24:26.795 --> 01:24:29.264
I WASN'T -- EIGHTEEN THE REASON

01:24:29.330 --> 01:24:29.864
I'M NOT SUPPORTED THIS TODAY

01:24:29.931 --> 01:24:30.498
FACT I'VE BEEN DEBATING BACK AND

01:24:30.565 --> 01:24:31.099
FORTH IN MY IN MY HEAD ABOUT

01:24:31.166 --> 01:24:33.168
THIS BECAUSE THIS IDEA OF OF THE

01:24:33.234 --> 01:24:36.004
PRIMARY AND THE PRIMARY --

01:24:36.070 --> 01:24:36.638
KNOWING THAT YOU'RE GOING INTO

01:24:36.704 --> 01:24:39.274
THE GENERAL -- AND YET I THINK

01:24:39.340 --> 01:24:40.275
THERE MIGHT BE A BIT OF A

01:24:40.341 --> 01:24:42.010
SLIPPERY SLOPE -- THAT'S THAT'S

01:24:42.076 --> 01:24:42.977
THERE BECAUSE ONCE YOU'RE

BEGINNING TO VOTE IN A IN A

01:24:44.679 --> 01:24:46.047
PRIMARY AT SEVENTEEN WILL THEN

01:24:46.114 --> 01:24:47.048
WHY NOT BE ABLE TO VOTE IN THE

01:24:47.115 --> 01:24:49.818
GENERAL -- AT AT SEVENTEEN AND I

01:24:49.884 --> 01:24:51.186
THINK I STRUGGLE WITH A LOT OF

01:24:51.252 --> 01:24:52.687
OUR ARE THESE THE THE THIS

01:24:52.754 --> 01:24:54.389
QUESTION OF OF THE AGE OF OF

01:24:54.456 --> 01:24:56.124
MAJORITY -- AND WHEN YOU ARE

01:24:56.191 --> 01:24:57.892
ABLE TO SIGN A CONTRACT AND IT'S

01:24:57.959 --> 01:24:59.661
LEGALLY BINDING -- WHEN YOU'RE

01:24:59.727 --> 01:25:02.197
ABLE TO GO INTO THE MILITARY --

01:25:02.263 --> 01:25:04.732

WHEN YOU CAN A DRINK ALCOHOL ALL

01:25:08.436 --> 01:25:09.904
OF THAT IS AT THE AGE OF?

01:25:09.971 --> 01:25:10.939
TWENTY ONE I THINK IN THIS

01:25:11.005 --> 01:25:12.941
COUNTRY WE NEED TO HAVE A A A A

01:25:13.007 --> 01:25:14.976
A REAL DEBATE ABOUT WHAT IS THE

01:25:15.043 --> 01:25:16.644
AGE OF MAJORITY I'M NOT SURE

01:25:16.711 --> 01:25:18.546
THAT THAT AGES -- EIGHTEEN MAYBE

01:25:18.613 --> 01:25:20.415
IT'S TWENTY ONE BUT YET WE ARE

01:25:20.482 --> 01:25:22.183
PRETTY SCHIZOPHRENIC AND HOW WE

01:25:22.250 --> 01:25:24.185
THAT WE WE DECIDE WHEN YOU CAN

01:25:24.252 --> 01:25:27.355
DO ONE THING OR OR THE OTHER --

01:25:27.422 --> 01:25:29.023
AND FOR THAT REASON -- I AM NOT

01:25:29.090 --> 01:25:30.525
GOING TO BE SUPPORTIVE OF THIS --

01:25:30.592 --> 01:25:32.660

WHAT THE FEDERAL RULES ARE I

01:25:33.995 --> 01:25:35.830
THINK WE TO BE PRETTY CONSISTENT --

01:25:35.897 --> 01:25:37.832
A WITH THAT -- I DO THINK THAT

01:25:37.899 --> 01:25:39.334
THERE ARE SOME BUT SIXTEEN YEAR

01:25:39.400 --> 01:25:40.835

01:27:12.961 --> 01:27:14.128
DISTINCTION HERE AS WE'VE

01:27:14.195 --> 01:27:15.763

01:27:15.830 --> 01:27:16.898
ALL WELL FOR ONE THING OF

01:27:16.965 --> 01:27:20.635
CHILDREN ARE YOUNG YOUNGER THAN

01:27:20.702 --> 01:27:21.235
EIGHTEEN ARE USUALLY LIVING AT

01:27:21.302 --> 01:27:22.403
HOME OKAY OUT SO THEY DON'T HAVE

01:27:22.470 --> 01:27:23.972
THE RESPONSIBILITY OF HOME

01:27:24.038 --> 01:27:26.507
OWNERSHIP OR MONTHLY FRENCH AND

THAT THEY MAKE IT.

01:27:38.853 --> 01:27:39.487
A PART TIME JOB WHETHER IN

01:27:39.554 --> 01:27:40.154
SCHOOL SO IT'S NOT SAME

01:27:40.221 --> 01:27:40.888
RESPONSIBILITY.

01:27:40.955 --> 01:27:41.823
AS OF AS THE HEAD OF A FAMILY OR

01:27:41.889 --> 01:27:42.457
HOUSEHOLD ARE LIVING ON THEIR

01:27:42.523 --> 01:27:43.791
OWN EVEN WHEN THEY'RE

01:27:43.858 --> 01:27:45.193
RESPONSIBLE FOR RENT.

01:27:45.259 --> 01:27:47.395
FOOD AND CLOTHING AND AND

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.068
VERY LIMITED IT WHEN YOU'RE WHEN

01:27:56.070 --> 01:27:57.472
INDICATIONS THAT THE IN YOUR

POSITION THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE

01:28:00.708 --> 01:28:01.976
REPRESENTING THE ORGANIZATION.

01:28:02.043 --> 01:28:03.811
IS SUCH THAT THE REQUIREMENTS

01:28:03.878 --> 01:28:05.246
THE THRESHOLD SHOULD BE THAT OF

01:28:05.313 --> 01:28:06.748
HOMEOWNERSHIP FOR EXAMPLE

01:28:06.814 --> 01:28:08.182
HOMEOWNERSHIP SHOULD BE

01:28:08.249 --> 01:28:09.917
ADDITIONAL QUALIFICATION NOW I'M

01:28:09.984 --> 01:28:11.552
NOT SAYING I'M NOT SAYING THAT

01:28:11.619 --> 01:28:13.488

BEING A HEAD OF A HOUSEHOLD YOU

01:28:14.789 --> 01:28:14.922
HAVE.

01:28:14.989 --> 01:28:16.691
OTHER RESPONSIBILITIES EVEN IF

01:28:27.468 --> 01:28:28.503
CALIFORNIA.

01:28:28.569 --> 01:28:29.570
IN EIGHTEEN IT WOULD BE VERY

01:28:29.637 --> 01:28:31.839
DIFFICULT TO HAVE OWN

01:31:11.632 --> 01:31:12.366
ALL MORNING LONG SO I WILL LET

01:31:12.433 --> 01:31:13.534
HIM I THANK AND I APPRECIATE THE

01:31:13.601 --> 01:31:14.936
COMMENTS THAT I'M SORRY I MISSED

01:31:15.002 --> 01:31:15.903
YOU YOUR YOUR YOUR TESTIMONIES --

01:31:15.970 --> 01:31:17.238
I'VE HEARD THEM BEFORE AND AND

01:31:17.305 --> 01:31:18.472
DAD I THINKS.

01:31:18.539 --> 01:31:19.874
AS ALWAYS THIS IS THIS BECOMES

01:31:19.941 --> 01:31:21.142
THE ISSUE OF WHAT PEOPLE THINK

01:31:21.209 --> 01:31:22.577
IS THE BEST APPROPRIATE WAY TO

01:31:22.643 --> 01:31:24.946
DEAL WITH THE ISSUE OF VOTING.

01:31:25.012 --> 01:31:26.414
AND WHAT AND WHERE THE AGE IS

01:31:26.480 --> 01:31:28.149
AND IS NOT BECAUSE THAT OUT THAT

01:31:28.216 --> 01:31:30.852
IS ALWAYS OPEN FOR A VARIETY OF

01:31:30.918 --> 01:31:32.253
CONVERSATIONS -- YOU KNOW I CAN

01:31:32.320 --> 01:31:33.721
GO IN ONE COMMUNITY AND AND

01:31:33.788 --> 01:31:35.189
WHICH I HAPPEN TALK TO YOUNG

01:31:35.256 --> 01:31:36.657
PEOPLE IN MY COMMUNITY

01:31:36.724 --> 01:31:38.459
PARTICULARLY -- AND AND THEY

01:31:38.526 --> 01:31:40.061
DON'T THEY THEY THEY DON'T THINK

01:31:40.127 --> 01:31:41.629
SIXTEEN AND SEVENTEEN YEAR OLDS

01:31:41.696 --> 01:31:42.230
ARE READY TO VOTE THAT'S JUST

01:31:42.296 --> 01:31:44.065
AND THESE ARE SIXTEEN AND

01:31:44.131 --> 01:31:44.732
SEVENTEEN YEAR OLDS WERE TELLING

01:31:44.799 --> 01:31:45.233
ME THIS.

01:31:45.299 --> 01:31:46.367
OP AND THERE'S ALWAYS A

01:31:46.434 --> 01:31:47.268
DISCUSSION ABOUT WHEN IT'S

01:31:47.335 --> 01:31:49.103
APPROPRIATE INAPPROPRIATE WHAT

01:31:49.170 --> 01:31:50.371
ARE THE STANDARDS THAT WE USE --

01:31:50.438 --> 01:31:52.106
I THINK WE CAN FIND VERY SHARP

01:31:52.173 --> 01:31:53.975
AND SMART YOUNG PEOPLE AT EVERY

01:31:54.041 --> 01:31:55.610
AGE.

01:31:55.676 --> 01:31:58.045
OF THAT'S THERE ALL THAT OF

01:31:58.112 --> 01:31:58.679
FIFTEEN SIXTEEN AND THEN AT THE

01:31:58.746 --> 01:31:59.547
SAME TIME I CAN FIND VERY

01:31:59.614 --> 01:32:01.916
RESPONSIBLE TEENAGERS AT

01:32:01.983 --> 01:32:02.550
SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN AND NINETEEN

01:32:02.617 --> 01:32:04.852
AND TWENTY ALSO IT'S ALWAYS THAT

01:32:04.919 --> 01:32:06.654
PARTICULAR ISSUE -- IT'S NOT

01:32:06.721 --> 01:32:08.689
ISSUE WHO PAYS TAXES -- BECAUSE

01:32:08.756 --> 01:32:10.124
AS SOON AS A KID EARNS A COUPLE

01:32:10.191 --> 01:32:11.659
DOLLARS SELLING PAPERS OR

01:32:11.726 --> 01:32:13.127
WHATEVER THEY DO NOWADAYS THEY

01:32:13.194 --> 01:32:14.996
PAY TAXES SO THAT OBVIOUSLY IS

01:32:15.062 --> 01:32:16.364
NOT AND YET WE PROBABLY I DON'T

01:32:16.430 --> 01:32:17.698
THINK WE WOULD STAND HERE AND

01:32:17.765 --> 01:32:19.000
ASK FOR EIGHT YEAR OLDS.

01:32:19.066 --> 01:32:21.335
HAD TO HAVE THE RIGHT TO VOTE

01:32:21.402 --> 01:32:22.436
ARE A WEEK SOME MIGHT BUT I

01:32:22.503 --> 01:32:25.606
DOUBT IF WE WOULD SO I AT I'M A

01:32:25.673 --> 01:32:26.407
I'M A PERSON STRONGLY BELIEVES

01:32:26.474 --> 01:32:27.041
THAT THAT THERE'S A TIME FRAME

01:32:27.108 --> 01:32:28.709
AND WE HAVE TO IDENTIFY THE TIME

01:32:28.776 --> 01:32:30.511
FRAME IN EIGHTEEN IS A TIME

01:32:30.578 --> 01:32:30.745
FRAME.

01:32:30.811 --> 01:32:32.346
AND YOU KEEP IF WE KEEP GOING

01:32:32.413 --> 01:32:33.714
BACKWARDS AND BACKWARDS AND

01:32:33.781 --> 01:32:36.017
BACKWARDS THEN ADVICE A

01:32:36.083 --> 01:32:36.918
SEVENTEEN YEAR OLDS CAN VOTE

01:32:36.984 --> 01:32:38.619
THEN OBVIOUSLY SXTEEN YEAR OLDS

01:32:38.686 --> 01:32:39.387
COMPATIBLE BECAUSE THEY GET.

01:32:39.453 --> 01:32:40.254
PROBABLY GET WAS AS GOOD AN

01:32:40.321 --> 01:32:42.023
ARGUMENT FOR IT IS THAT AND

01:32:42.089 --> 01:32:42.690
FIFTEEN YEAR OLDS COULD VOTE SO

01:32:42.757 --> 01:32:44.292
I THINK IT CONTINUES TO MOVE

01:32:44.358 --> 01:32:45.760
IT'S IT'S A MOVING TARGET AND

01:32:45.826 --> 01:32:47.795
AND UNTIL WE HAVE REAL SERIOUS

01:32:47.862 --> 01:32:50.031
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT MATURITY

01:32:50.097 --> 01:32:51.666
WHICH IS DIFFICULT TO IDENTIFY.

01:32:51.732 --> 01:32:53.100
A MINUTES DIFFICULT WE HAVE NO

01:32:53.167 --> 01:32:53.968
TEST WITH MATURITY THERE ARE

01:32:54.035 --> 01:32:55.469
SOME PEOPLE THIRTY WHO SHOULD

01:32:55.536 --> 01:33:04.045
NEVER VOTE OF BUT BUT THEY HAVE

01:33:04.111 --> 01:33:05.012
THE RIGHT TO VOTE WE KNOW THAT.

01:33:05.079 --> 01:33:06.080
AND SO SO I THINK IT'S IT'S IT'S

01:33:06.147 --> 01:33:06.881
A BIT AND WE'VE HAD THIS

01:33:06.948 --> 01:33:07.949
DISCUSSION BEFORE SO MY POSITION

01:33:08.015 --> 01:33:09.183
IS NOT A SURPRISE ANYBODY WITH

01:33:09.250 --> 01:33:09.784
HIS IN THIS COMMITTEE ON THE

01:33:09.850 --> 01:33:11.619
FLOOR -- THAT I I THINK THERE'S

01:33:11.686 --> 01:33:12.920
A TIME AND EIGHTEEN IS A TIME

01:33:12.987 --> 01:33:13.487
WHEN YOUNG PEOPLE WILL WE'VE

01:33:13.554 --> 01:33:15.056
IDENTIFIED IT -- HAVING BEEN A

01:33:15.122 --> 01:33:16.757
PART OF AS OLD AS I AM HAVING

01:33:16.824 --> 01:33:18.826
BEEN A PART OF THE DIALOGUE AND

01:33:18.893 --> 01:33:20.394
DISCUSSIONS ABOUT EIGHTEEN YEAR

01:33:20.461 --> 01:33:20.995
OLD VOTING.

01:33:21.062 --> 01:33:23.297
OUT THAT CAME INTO BEING BECAUSE

01:33:23.364 --> 01:33:24.999
THERE WAS SOME REAL TANGIBLE

01:33:25.066 --> 01:33:27.101
ISSUES IN THE SOCIETY THAT THAT

01:33:27.168 --> 01:33:29.203
PUSHED US FORWARD TO THAT NUMBER

01:33:29.270 --> 01:33:30.871
AND NOT JUST BECAUSE WE THOUGHT

01:33:30.938 --> 01:33:32.039
FOLKS WILL MATURE.

01:33:32.106 --> 01:33:33.274
BUT WE WERE DRAFTING YOUNG MEN

01:33:33.341 --> 01:33:35.309
INTO WAR PEOPLE WERE BEING ASKED

01:33:35.376 --> 01:33:36.877
TO FIGHT FOR THEIR COUNTRY THEY

01:33:36.944 --> 01:33:38.512
HAD ACCESS TO CIGARETTES AT THE

01:33:38.579 --> 01:33:39.380
TIME NOW WE'VE MOVED ON FROM

01:33:39.447 --> 01:33:40.314
THAT.

01:33:40.381 --> 01:33:41.182
AND SO WHAT HAPPENED IS THAT THE

01:33:41.248 --> 01:33:42.950
GOVERNMENT BEEN IDENTIFIED THIS

01:33:43.017 --> 01:33:44.418
IS THE AGE IN WHICH YOU COULD BE

01:33:44.485 --> 01:33:45.619
TRIED AS AN ADULT.

01:33:45.686 --> 01:33:47.521
YOU GO TO ADULT PRISON YOU CAN

01:33:47.588 --> 01:33:48.622
PUT FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE IN

01:33:48.689 --> 01:33:49.991
PRISON.

01:33:50.057 --> 01:33:51.125
AND SO YOU WERE TREATED AS AN

01:33:51.192 --> 01:33:52.893
ADULT -- THERE WERE FEW BECAME

01:33:52.960 --> 01:33:54.862
EMANCIPATED MINORS EARLY IN LIFE

01:33:54.929 --> 01:33:56.931
BECAUSE OF SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC

01:33:56.998 --> 01:33:58.833
SITUATIONS BUT WE IN MY

01:33:58.899 --> 01:34:00.835
GENERATION LOOKED AND SAW THAT

01:34:00.901 --> 01:34:02.770
AND I'D COULD NOT VOTED --

01:34:02.837 --> 01:34:03.637
EIGHTEEN LOOKED AND SAW THAT

01:34:03.704 --> 01:34:05.573
WAITING TO TWENTY ONE BY THAT

01:34:05.639 --> 01:34:06.741
TIME YOU HAD ALREADY MADE

01:34:06.807 --> 01:34:08.776
SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE

01:34:08.843 --> 01:34:10.845
COUNTRY THERE WAS A DRAFT THAT

01:34:10.911 --> 01:34:12.246
OCCURRED FOR EIGHTEEN YEAR OLDS.

01:34:12.313 --> 01:34:14.081
AND AND SO IT LOOK AT THE

01:34:14.148 --> 01:34:15.116
SITUATION AND SAID YOU KNOW

01:34:15.182 --> 01:34:16.684
WE'RE ASKING THESE YOUNG MEN TO

01:34:16.751 --> 01:34:18.052
DIE FOR THEIR COUNTRY TO BE

01:34:18.119 --> 01:34:19.920
INVOLVED IN WARS AND CONFLICTS

01:34:19.987 --> 01:34:21.555
AND YET THEY DON'T HAVE ANYTHING

01:34:21.622 --> 01:34:21.956
TO SAY ABOUT IT.

01:34:22.023 --> 01:34:23.724
OKAY THEY HAVE A WORD TO SAY

01:34:23.791 --> 01:34:25.259
ABOUT WHY THEY SHOULD BE THERE

01:34:25.326 --> 01:34:27.828
AND SO THAT PUSH THEN BECAME AS

01:34:27.895 --> 01:34:28.963
A RESULT OF ALL THE WOULD BE

01:34:29.030 --> 01:34:30.998
ADULT RESPONSIBILITIES.

01:34:31.065 --> 01:34:34.535
AND THE CHALLENGES THAT WE GAVE

01:34:34.602 --> 01:34:35.936
TO YOUNG PEOPLE WAS THERE.

01:34:36.003 --> 01:34:37.104
EIGHTEEN A ONCE YOU BECAME

01:34:37.171 --> 01:34:37.772
EIGHTEEN YOU KNOW ANYTHING COULD

01:34:37.838 --> 01:34:38.873
HAPPEN BUT YOU WERE CONSIDERED

01:34:38.939 --> 01:34:39.840
AN ADULT.

01:34:39.907 --> 01:34:41.709
AND YOU HAD CONSEQUENCES FOR

01:34:41.776 --> 01:34:44.445
YOUR BEHAVIOR AS AN ADULT AND SO

01:34:44.512 --> 01:34:46.113
I I THINK IT'S A IT'S A LARGER

01:34:46.180 --> 01:34:48.115
CONVERSATION -- THAT'S THERE BUT

01:34:48.182 --> 01:34:49.550
I KIND OF HONOR THE EIGHTEEN

01:34:49.617 --> 01:34:51.318
BECAUSE I WAS THERE FOR THE

01:34:51.385 --> 01:34:52.253
CONVERSATION AND KNOW WHY CAME

01:34:52.319 --> 01:34:54.221
INTO EXISTENCE AND NOT JUST

01:34:54.288 --> 01:34:55.623
BECAUSE THOSE WERE EIGHTEEN

01:34:55.689 --> 01:34:56.624
THOUGHT THAT THEY WERE MATURE

01:34:56.690 --> 01:34:57.458
ENOUGH.

01:34:57.525 --> 01:35:02.229
BUT BUT THE SOCIETY FELT THEY

01:35:02.296 --> 01:35:03.931
WERE MATURE ENOUGH TO BE HELD

01:35:03.998 --> 01:35:04.899
ACCOUNTABLE FOR SOME SERIOUS

01:35:04.965 --> 01:35:05.533
CONSEQUENCES OF LIFE AND DEATH.

01:35:05.599 --> 01:35:06.667
AND AND AS A RESULT THEY GOT THE

01:35:06.734 --> 01:35:08.803
RIGHT TO VOTE SO -- I THANK YOU

01:35:08.869 --> 01:35:09.403
FOR FOR YOUR COMMENTS AND AND

01:35:09.470 --> 01:35:10.704
WHAT YOU ARE AND I ALWAYS

01:35:10.771 --> 01:35:12.106
APPRECIATE WHEN YOUNG PEOPLE ARE

01:35:12.173 --> 01:35:13.808
REALLY ACTIVELY ENGAGED AND

01:35:13.874 --> 01:35:15.076
COMMITTED TO IT HOPE.

01:35:15.142 --> 01:35:16.777
IT STAYS THERE WE ARE STRUGGLING

01:35:16.844 --> 01:35:18.079
NOW TRY TO GET EIGHTEEN YEAR

01:35:18.145 --> 01:35:20.448
OLDS TO VOTE I MEAN YOU KNOW SO --

01:35:20.514 --> 01:35:22.049
THAT'S A THAT'S A CHALLENGE AS

01:35:22.116 --> 01:35:22.683
THE AND I'M NOT SURE OF LEADING

01:35:22.750 --> 01:35:24.151
WITH VOTED SEVENTEEN SOLVE THE

01:35:24.218 --> 01:35:25.553
ISSUE THAT WILL FACE.

01:35:25.619 --> 01:35:27.321
BUT IT TRULY IS A A DISCUSSION

01:35:27.388 --> 01:35:28.989
THAT THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE AND

01:35:29.056 --> 01:35:30.925
AND MAKE SOME FINAL DISCUSSIONS

01:35:30.991 --> 01:35:31.926
ABOUT.

01:35:31.992 --> 01:35:34.595
OF THE ISSUE OF WHAT WE IDENTIFY

01:35:34.662 --> 01:35:36.497
AS THE QUALIFIERS THE PEOPLE WHO

01:35:36.564 --> 01:35:37.731
SHOULD BE ABLE TO VOTE WHERE IS

01:35:37.798 --> 01:35:39.400
IT WHERE DOES THE LINE FALL WHAT

01:35:39.467 --> 01:35:40.968
IT WAS AGE GROUPING THAT'S THERE.

01:35:41.035 --> 01:35:42.703
THAT'S SO IMPORTANT AND I DON'T

01:35:42.770 --> 01:35:44.138
THINK WE'VE HAD ENOUGH OF THAT

01:35:44.205 --> 01:35:46.073
CONVERSATION YET -- TO DEFY WITH

01:35:46.140 --> 01:35:47.541
THEIR TRUE CONSEQUENCES ADULT

01:35:47.608 --> 01:35:49.510
CONSEQUENCES FOR THOSE FOLKS WHO

01:35:49.577 --> 01:35:50.945
AT DIFFERENT AGES AND THAT'S

01:35:51.011 --> 01:35:52.146
WHAT'S REALLY.

01:35:52.213 --> 01:35:53.581
DRIVING ME IN THE IMPORTANCE OF

01:35:53.647 --> 01:35:54.715
IT SO I APPRECIATE ALL YOUR

01:35:54.782 --> 01:35:56.984
COMMENTS AND THANK YOU FOR FOR

01:35:57.051 --> 01:36:00.888
WHAT OF WHAT YOU SAID TODAY

01:36:00.955 --> 01:36:02.323
THANK YOU.

THANK YOU DOCTOR WEBER AND IT

01:36:03.257 --> 01:36:04.792
AGAIN I THINK YOU SUMMARIZE A

01:36:04.859 --> 01:36:05.226
LOT OF MY THOUGHTS.

01:36:05.292 --> 01:36:06.894
YOU KNOW AS WE WE TEND TO AGREE

01:36:06.961 --> 01:36:08.395
AND THIS COMMITTEE -- THAT YOU

01:36:08.462 --> 01:36:10.531
KNOW FIRST OF ALL I DO DISAGREE

01:36:10.598 --> 01:36:11.899
WITH THE RATIONALE BEHIND THE

01:36:11.966 --> 01:36:13.200
OPPOSITION.

01:36:13.267 --> 01:36:14.468
I THINK YOU ARE MORE THAN

01:36:14.535 --> 01:36:15.970
CAPABLE OF THESE YOUNG PEOPLE

01:36:16.036 --> 01:36:17.138
WHO COME HERE TODAY AND I HAVE

01:36:17.204 --> 01:36:18.339
TESTIFIED.

01:36:18.405 --> 01:36:19.840
I THINK YOU ARE MORE THAN MORE

01:36:19.907 --> 01:36:21.609
THAN CAPABLE OF BEING ABLE TO

01:36:21.675 --> 01:36:23.144
VOTE AND TO AND TO MAKE GOOD

01:36:23.210 --> 01:36:26.447
DECISIONS -- YOU KNOW.

01:36:26.514 --> 01:36:27.748
MY THIRTEEN YEAR OLD DAUGHTER.

01:36:27.815 --> 01:36:29.850
THE OF BY VIRTUE OF THE FACT THE

01:36:29.917 --> 01:36:31.385
OF WHAT I'M INVOLVED IN IN HER

01:36:31.452 --> 01:36:32.653
OWN INTEREST.

01:36:32.720 --> 01:36:34.321
KNOWS A LOT ABOUT POLITICS AND

01:36:34.388 --> 01:36:35.489
TALKS ABOUT THESE ISSUES ALL THE

01:36:35.556 --> 01:36:36.657
TIME I THINK SHE WOULD BE MORE

01:36:36.724 --> 01:36:38.526
THAN CAPABLE OF VOTING AND

01:36:38.592 --> 01:36:40.060
MAKING GOOD DECISIONS.

01:36:40.127 --> 01:36:41.529
ON BEHALF OF OUR OF OF OUR

01:36:41.595 --> 01:36:43.430
REPUBLIC -- IT'S JUST THAT WE

01:36:43.497 --> 01:36:45.332
HAVE MADE A SOCIETAL DECISION

01:36:45.399 --> 01:36:47.067
THAT EIGHTEEN IS THE AGE OF

01:36:47.134 --> 01:36:49.303
MAJORITY -- AND THAT APPLIES TO

01:36:49.370 --> 01:36:51.172
EVERYBODY ACROSS YOU KNOW ALL

01:36:51.238 --> 01:36:54.141
LINES EIGHTEEN IS IS IS IS THE

01:36:54.208 --> 01:36:57.111
AGE OF MAJORITY -- I AND I THINK

01:36:57.178 --> 01:36:58.979
THAT IN ORDER TO MOVETHAT

01:36:59.046 --> 01:37:00.781
NUMBER THERE'S GOT TO BE SOME.

01:37:00.848 --> 01:37:03.551
REASONABLE AND LOGICAL REASON

01:37:03.617 --> 01:37:06.453
FOR DOING SO RIGHT -- AND THERE

01:37:06.520 --> 01:37:09.156
BEEN ARGUMENTS MADE IN THIS BODY.

01:37:09.223 --> 01:37:11.559
NOT BY MY PARTY.

01:37:11.625 --> 01:37:13.093
THE BY THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY.

01:37:13.160 --> 01:37:15.262
THEY ARGUE FOR OLDER AGES.

01:37:15.329 --> 01:37:17.531
THEY SAY THAT YOU'RE NOT ABLE TO

01:37:17.598 --> 01:37:18.299
MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT WHETHER OR

01:37:18.365 --> 01:37:20.034
NOT TO BUY TO BUY TOBACCO

01:37:20.100 --> 01:37:21.835
PRODUCTS FOR INSTANCE.

01:37:21.902 --> 01:37:24.171
YOU GOT TO BE -- TWENTY ONE THEY

01:37:24.238 --> 01:37:25.839
MAKE ARGUMENTS IS SAY YOU SHOULD

01:37:25.906 --> 01:37:27.341
NOT BE ABLE TO BUY A GUN.

01:37:27.408 --> 01:37:28.609
UNTIL YOU'RE TWENTY ONE BECAUSE

01:37:28.676 --> 01:37:29.843
YOU CAN'T MAKE.

01:37:29.910 --> 01:37:30.878
YOU CAN'T BE SO YOU CAN'T

01:37:30.945 --> 01:37:32.580
POSSIBLY BE SAFE WITH THAT GUN

01:37:32.646 --> 01:37:34.181
YOU CAN'T MAKE THAT DECISION.

01:37:34.248 --> 01:37:37.318
AT EIGHTEEN THOSE ARGUMENTS MADE

01:37:37.384 --> 01:37:38.819
BY THE MAJORITY PARTY HERE.

01:37:38.886 --> 01:37:40.454
THERE WE WERE LECTURED TO YEARS

01:37:40.521 --> 01:37:41.989
AGO ABOUT HOW WE CAN'T POSSIBLY

01:37:42.056 --> 01:37:44.959
HOLD -- PEOPLE WHO COMMIT CRIMES

01:37:45.025 --> 01:37:47.661
WHEN THEY'RE EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY

01:37:47.728 --> 01:37:48.229
FIVE TO AN ADULT STANDARD.

01:37:48.295 --> 01:37:52.166
BECAUSE QUOTE RECENT NEERAJ

01:37:52.233 --> 01:37:54.501
NEUROLOGICAL RESEARCH SHOWS THAT

01:37:54.568 --> 01:37:56.070
COGNITIVE BRAIN DEVELOPMENT.

01:37:56.136 --> 01:37:58.272
CONTINUES WELL BEYOND AGE

01:37:58.339 --> 01:37:58.772
EIGHTEEN AND INTO EARLY

01:37:58.839 --> 01:38:01.242
ADULTHOOD FOR BOYS AND YOUNG MEN

01:38:01.308 --> 01:38:02.576
IN PARTICULAR WERE TOLD.

01:38:02.643 --> 01:38:04.111
THIS PROCESS CONTINUES INTO THE

01:38:04.178 --> 01:38:05.446
MID TWENTIES THE PARTS OF THE

01:38:05.512 --> 01:38:06.714
BRAIN THAT ARE STILL DEVELOPING

01:38:06.780 --> 01:38:07.848
DURING THIS PROCESS AFFECT

01:38:07.915 --> 01:38:09.016
JUDGMENT.

01:38:09.083 --> 01:38:10.851
AND DECISION MAKING AND SO THEY

01:38:10.918 --> 01:38:11.885
THEREFORE CAN'T BE HELD

01:38:11.952 --> 01:38:13.954
ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR DECISION

01:38:14.021 --> 01:38:16.624
SO IT'S IT'S NOT MY PARTY.

01:38:16.690 --> 01:38:19.526
IT'S ARGUING THAT.

01:38:19.593 --> 01:38:20.794
PEOPLE WHO ARE.

01:38:20.861 --> 01:38:22.329
EIGHTEEN OR YOUNGER AREN'T ABLE

01:38:22.396 --> 01:38:24.331
TO MAKE GOOD JUDGMENT DECISIONS

01:38:24.398 --> 01:38:25.599
IS ACTUALLY THE MAJORITY PARTY

01:38:25.666 --> 01:38:27.167
THAT CONTINUES TO MAKE THOSE

01:38:27.234 --> 01:38:29.436
KIND OF ARGUMENTS -- I THINK

01:38:29.503 --> 01:38:30.938
THAT WE COULD HAVE A DISCUSSION

01:38:31.005 --> 01:38:33.274
ABOUT OUR OUR MINERS.

01:38:33.340 --> 01:38:33.874
IF WE'RE GOING TO SAY THE HEY

01:38:33.941 --> 01:38:36.277
MINERS WHO ARE AFFECTED BY

01:38:36.343 --> 01:38:37.344
POLICY.

01:38:37.411 --> 01:38:38.879
SHOULD HAVE THE ABILITY TO VOTE

01:38:38.946 --> 01:38:40.848
LET'S HAVE THAT DISCUSSION WHY

01:38:40.914 --> 01:38:43.150
ARE WE STOPPING AT SEVENTEEN AS

01:38:43.217 --> 01:38:43.717
HAS BEEN POINTED OUT BY MANY

01:38:43.784 --> 01:38:45.052
PEOPLE.

01:38:45.119 --> 01:38:46.654
MY THIRTEEN YEAR OLD AGAIN PAYS

01:38:46.720 --> 01:38:48.188
TAXES.

01:38:48.255 --> 01:38:49.556
SHE HAS HER OWN ALLOWANCE SHE

01:38:49.623 --> 01:38:51.492
HAS HER OWN MONEY WHEN HE

01:38:51.558 --> 01:38:52.459
DOESN'T BUY SOMETHING AT A STORE

01:38:52.526 --> 01:38:53.861
SHE PAYS SALES TAX.

01:38:53.927 --> 01:38:55.462
YOU CAN'T THE JUSTIFICATION CAM

01:38:55.529 --> 01:38:56.563
ALONE BE.

01:38:56.630 --> 01:38:59.300
NO TAXATION WITHOUT WITHOUT

01:38:59.366 --> 01:38:59.833
REPRESENTATION [inaudible]

01:38:59.900 --> 01:39:01.068
RIGHT.

01:39:01.135 --> 01:39:02.503
AND SHE'S JUST AS AFFECTED BY

01:39:02.569 --> 01:39:04.571
POLICY AND SHE'S CAPABLE OF

01:39:04.638 --> 01:39:06.273
MAKING JUDGEMENT DECISIONS TO

01:39:06.340 --> 01:39:09.076
WHY STOP AT SEVENTEEN RIGHT WHY

01:39:09.143 --> 01:39:10.411
NOT WHY NOT ALLOW ALL YOU KNOW

01:39:10.477 --> 01:39:13.047
IN IN MANY TRADITIONS.

01:39:13.113 --> 01:39:14.782
THIRTEEN IS THE AGE OF MAJORITY.

01:39:14.848 --> 01:39:15.816
IN THE JEWISH TRADITION FOR

01:39:15.883 --> 01:39:19.253
EXAMPLE -- YOU KNOW SO.

01:39:19.320 --> 01:39:20.854
YOU COULD MAKE IS AS AS DOCTOR

01:39:20.921 --> 01:39:22.956
WEBER I THINK REALLY LAID OUT

01:39:23.023 --> 01:39:23.457
YOU KNOW YOU COULD MAKE

01:39:23.524 --> 01:39:24.825
ARGUMENTS.

01:39:24.892 --> 01:39:27.227
ALL AROUND BUT WE'VE DECIDED

01:39:27.294 --> 01:39:28.996
EIGHTEEN IS THE AGE OF MAJORITY.

01:39:29.063 --> 01:39:31.198
AND UNLESS THERE'S A REALLY GOOD

01:39:31.265 --> 01:39:33.334
REASON FOR DOING SO WHY SHOULD

01:39:33.400 --> 01:39:34.068
WE DO THIS.

01:39:34.134 --> 01:39:36.036
A VERY ARBITRARILY MOVEMENT I

01:39:36.103 --> 01:39:37.037
MEAN.

01:39:37.104 --> 01:39:38.505
IF WE REALLY BELIEVE THAT ALL

01:39:38.572 --> 01:39:40.274
MINOR SHOULD VOTE LET'S MOVE TO

01:39:40.341 --> 01:39:40.908
THIRTEEN THEN.

01:39:40.974 --> 01:39:43.410
RIGHT IF WE DO BELIEVE AS HAS

01:39:43.477 --> 01:39:44.378
BEEN.

01:39:44.445 --> 01:39:46.814
ARGUED IN THIS BODY THAT NO EVEN

01:39:46.880 --> 01:39:49.283
AT EIGHTEEN AND UP.

01:39:49.350 --> 01:39:49.883
TO TWENTY FIVE YOU CAN'T MAKE

01:39:49.950 --> 01:39:51.518
GOOD JUDGMENT CALLS MAYBE

01:39:51.585 --> 01:39:52.119
THERE'S AN ARGUMENT FOR MOVING

01:39:52.186 --> 01:39:53.620
IT UP.

01:39:53.687 --> 01:39:55.689
RIGHT BUT TO JUST SAY ALL WELL

01:39:55.756 --> 01:39:57.191
WE'RE GONNA MAKE IT SEVENTEEN

01:39:57.257 --> 01:39:58.258
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE WITH A

01:39:58.325 --> 01:39:59.093
SIXTEEN YEAR OLD A SEVENTEEN

01:39:59.159 --> 01:40:00.394
YEAR OLD WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE

01:40:00.461 --> 01:40:02.062
WHEN A FIFTEEN YEAR OLD.

01:40:02.129 --> 01:40:03.530
AND A SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD.

01:40:03.597 --> 01:40:04.898
IT JUST SEEMS COMPLETELY

01:40:04.965 --> 01:40:06.900
ARBITRARY AND IT DOESN'T HAVE.

01:40:06.967 --> 01:40:09.703
THE STRONG JUSTIFICATION FOR FOR

01:40:09.770 --> 01:40:11.338
MOVING THAT AGE LIMIT -- AND SO

01:40:11.405 --> 01:40:12.573
I THINK THAT'S WHERE WE END UP

01:40:12.639 --> 01:40:14.508
IS NOT BECAUSE WE DON'T BELIEVE

01:40:14.575 --> 01:40:15.509
THAT YOU ARE VERY CAPABLE AND

01:40:15.576 --> 01:40:15.909
THAT.

01:40:15.976 --> 01:40:17.845
DECISIONS THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE A

01:40:17.911 --> 01:40:18.779
VOICE AND YOU DO HAVE THE

01:40:18.846 --> 01:40:20.814
ABILITY TO BE INVOLVED IN

01:40:20.881 --> 01:40:21.415
POLITICS AND I HOPE THAT YOU

01:40:21.482 --> 01:40:23.150
WILL BE -- IT'D GET INVOLVED IN

01:40:23.217 --> 01:40:25.185
CAMPAIGNS I WAS VERY ACTIVE

01:40:25.252 --> 01:40:26.019
MYSELF.

01:40:26.086 --> 01:40:27.354
YOU KNOW I GOT ELECTED THE BOARD

01:40:27.421 --> 01:40:29.356
OF SUPERVISORS AT TWENTY SEVEN

01:40:29.423 --> 01:40:30.357
YEARS OLD.

01:40:30.424 --> 01:40:31.825
COURSE ALL THESE EXAMPLES OF THE

01:40:31.892 --> 01:40:34.161
USE OF US CAN ELECTED ROLL OVER.

01:40:34.228 --> 01:40:35.062
EIGHTEEN RIGHT.

01:40:35.129 --> 01:40:36.430
AND I WAS VERY ACTIVE

01:40:36.497 --> 01:40:37.931
POLITICALLY AS YOU ARE IN HIGH

01:40:37.998 --> 01:40:39.166
SCHOOL I I COULDN'T WAIT TO VOTE

01:40:39.233 --> 01:40:43.270
I WANTED TO BUT I KNEW THE

01:40:43.337 --> 01:40:44.071
EIGHTEEN WAS THE H. NOW.

01:40:44.138 --> 01:40:45.472
AND THAT IS IT WASN'T I DIDN'T

01:40:45.539 --> 01:40:47.107
FEEL IT WAS UNFAIR.

01:40:47.174 --> 01:40:48.709
IT'S WHAT'S BEEN ESTABLISHED.

01:40:48.776 --> 01:40:50.444
AND SO -- THERE'S BEEN A MOTION

01:40:50.511 --> 01:40:52.379
AND A SECOND.

01:40:52.446 --> 01:40:54.681
I WILL ALLOW -- MR MULLIN TO

01:40:54.748 --> 01:40:56.016
CLOSE THANK YOU MISTER VICE

01:40:56.083 --> 01:40:57.451
CHAIR APPRECIATE THE ROBUST

01:40:57.518 --> 01:40:58.952
CONVERSATION IT'S ACTUALLY AN

01:40:59.019 --> 01:41:00.287
INTERESTINGJUMPING OFF POINT

01:41:00.354 --> 01:41:01.655
TALKING ABOUT.

01:41:01.722 --> 01:41:05.025
THE ARBITRARY NATURE OF MOVING.

01:41:05.092 --> 01:41:06.293
THE VOTING AGE.

01:41:06.360 --> 01:41:09.396
ACTUALLY WE ARE GROUNDED.

01:41:09.463 --> 01:41:11.131
IN BECOMING EIGHTEEN BY THE

01:41:11.198 --> 01:41:15.035
GENERAL ELECTION WE ARE LEGALLY

01:41:15.102 --> 01:41:15.335
[inaudible]

01:41:15.402 --> 01:41:16.703
CONNECTED.

01:41:16.770 --> 01:41:20.774
TO THE AGE OF OF MAJORITY.

01:41:20.841 --> 01:41:21.975
AND SO.

01:41:22.042 --> 01:41:24.344
THIS APPROACH IS AN INCREMENTAL

01:41:24.411 --> 01:41:25.412
ONE RIGHT.

01:41:25.479 --> 01:41:27.714
THE TURNING SEVENTEEN FOR THE

01:41:27.781 --> 01:41:30.050
PRIMARY SO FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS

01:41:30.117 --> 01:41:32.286
BOB WILL BE EIGHTEEN BY THE

01:41:32.352 --> 01:41:33.754
GENERAL.

01:41:33.821 --> 01:41:35.022
IF THESE KIDS IF THEY IF THESE

01:41:35.088 --> 01:41:36.056
VOTERS ARE GOING TO BE

01:41:36.123 --> 01:41:38.158
PARTICIPATING IN SELECTING FROM

01:41:38.225 --> 01:41:39.326
A POOL OF CANDIDATES TO THE

01:41:39.393 --> 01:41:42.129
GENERAL ELECTION WHEN THEY'RE

01:41:42.196 --> 01:41:44.264
EIGHTEEN THE GET WHEN THEY'RE

EIGHTEEN THE GENERAL ELECTION.

01:41:45.365 --> 01:41:46.533
THEY OUGHT TO HAVE A CHANCE TO

01:41:46.600 --> 01:41:48.068
SHAPE THAT POOL OF CANDIDATES.

01:41:48.135 --> 01:41:50.637
IN THE PRIMARY ELECTION WE ARE

01:41:50.704 --> 01:41:54.408
LEGALLY LINKING. TO TO BECOMING

01:41:54.475 --> 01:41:55.609
EIGHTEEN AND PARTICIPATING IN

01:41:55.676 --> 01:41:56.944
THE PRIMARY IN FACT.

01:41:57.010 --> 01:41:58.245
NEARLY HALF OF STATES IN THE

01:41:58.312 --> 01:42:00.147
COUNTRY.

01:42:00.214 --> 01:42:02.216
THIS IS THE LAW IN HAVE NEARLY

01:42:02.282 --> 01:42:03.750
HALF THE STATES.

01:42:03.817 --> 01:42:06.620
ILLINOIS INDIANA KENTUCKY.

01:42:06.687 --> 01:42:11.492
MISSISSIPPI OHIO SOUTH CAROLINA.

01:42:11.558 --> 01:42:12.693
JUST TO NAME A HANDFUL.

01:42:12.759 --> 01:42:14.962
ALREADY THE LAW CALIFORNIA'S

01:42:15.028 --> 01:42:17.564
BEHIND THE CURVE ON THIS ISSUE.

01:42:17.631 --> 01:42:19.399
SO WE ARE DOING GREAT ON PRE

01:42:19.466 --> 01:42:21.535
REGISTRATION AND ALL SORTS OF

01:42:21.602 --> 01:42:23.070
EFFORTS THAT THE SECRETARY OF

01:42:23.136 --> 01:42:24.605
STATE'S OFFICE IS INVOLVED IN.

01:42:24.671 --> 01:42:27.107
BUT WE ARE TRULY BEHIND.

01:42:27.174 --> 01:42:28.509
ON THIS ISSUE WHEN WE SHOULD BE

01:42:28.575 --> 01:42:31.812
LEADING ON THE ISSUE SO BOB EAT

01:42:31.879 --> 01:42:33.247
THERE'S GOING TO BE A DISCUSSION

01:42:33.313 --> 01:42:35.682
ON A MISTER LOS AMENDMENT AND

01:42:35.749 --> 01:42:37.718
APPROACH I ALSO SUPPORT.

01:42:37.784 --> 01:42:38.485
BY THE WAY.

01:42:38.552 --> 01:42:40.254
BUT THERE WILL BE A CONVERSATION

01:42:40.320 --> 01:42:44.258
THAT ENSUES MY HOPE IS THAT BOTHOF OUR A. C. A.'S.

01:42:44.324 --> 01:42:45.759
MAKE IT THROUGH THE ASSEMBLY TO

01:42:45.826 --> 01:42:46.860
THE SENATE WE WILL HAVE A

01:42:46.927 --> 01:42:48.595
CONVERSATION ABOUT JOINING

01:42:48.662 --> 01:42:50.097
FORCES I'M SURE BECAUSE WE DON'T

01:42:50.163 --> 01:42:51.865
WANT COMPETING.

01:42:51.932 --> 01:42:53.400
PROPOSALS GOING TO THE BALLOT

01:42:53.467 --> 01:42:56.303
THAT DOESN'T MAKE MUCH SENSE MY

01:42:56.370 --> 01:42:57.771
INTEREST IS UP.

01:42:57.838 --> 01:42:58.472
YOU KNOW HOW DO WE CATCH

01:42:58.539 --> 01:43:00.307
CALIFORNIA UP WITH WITH THE REST

01:43:00.374 --> 01:43:01.875
OF THE COUNTRY HOW DO WE COME UP

01:43:01.942 --> 01:43:03.644
WITH AN APPROACH THAT'S VIABLE

01:43:03.710 --> 01:43:04.578
BECAUSE NOT ONLY DOES THIS

01:43:04.645 --> 01:43:06.179

WE'VE BEEN [inaudible]

02:05:19.645 --> 02:05:23.015

STILL HAVE SOME QUESTIONS.

02:05:32.491 --> 02:05:33.492
AND I THINK THAT FIRST OF ALL I

02:05:33.559 --> 02:05:35.461
DON'T THINK IT'S AN EMERGENCY --

02:05:35.527 --> 02:05:36.962
WE WERE TOLD THAT THERE ARE TWO

02:05:37.029 --> 02:05:40.366
MAIN ISSUES -- WHY THEY WANTED?

TO HAVE THIS BILL.

02:05:41.967 --> 02:05:45.204

I THINK THIS IS THE SORT OF A

02:06:03.355 --> 02:06:04.723
REACH TOO FAR -- BUT SECTORS

02:06:04.790 --> 02:06:07.559
STATE. TWO REASONS THAT WERE

02:06:07.626 --> 02:06:09.795
GIVEN WAS -- ONE THE AMERICAN

02:06:09.862 --> 02:06:11.130

IT'S BECAUSE AT AGE EIGHTEEN THE

02:13:16.054 --> 02:13:17.122
WEIGHT OF UPROOTING ONESELF FROM

AS A RESULT MANY OF OUR ELECTED

EVERY DAY LIFE.

02:13:56.061 --> 02:13:57.262

INHERIT A WAR ON TERROR THAT

02:14:18.383 --> 02:14:20.852
STARTED BEFORE WE WERE BORN.

02:14:20.919 --> 02:14:22.521
WE HAD TO GROW UP FAST BECAUSE

02:14:22.587 --> 02:14:24.156
WE HAD TO SEE MORE THROUGH OUR

02:24:52.817 --> 02:24:54.052
ABOUT LIKE A GENERATIONAL.

02:24:54.118 --> 02:24:55.887
BATTLE AND I THINK REALLY GOT TO

02:24:55.953 --> 02:24:59.290
PUT THAT AWAY YOU KNOW -- WHAT I

02:24:59.357 --> 02:25:00.458
WOULD ASK THOSE JUST IS THIS IS

02:25:00.525 --> 02:25:02.326
QUESTION IS?

02:25:02.393 --> 02:25:03.928
IF THE ARGUMENT IS.

02:25:03.995 --> 02:25:05.463
AND I THINK IT'S IT'S A RATIONAL

02:25:05.530 --> 02:25:06.798
ARGUMENT TO MAKE IF THE ARGUMENT

02:25:06.864 --> 02:25:08.766
IS THAT.

02:25:08.833 --> 02:25:09.600
HIGH SCHOOLERS.

02:25:09.667 --> 02:25:11.436
YOUNG.

02:25:11.502 --> 02:25:13.004
YOUNG PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE THE

02:25:13.071 --> 02:25:14.505
RIGHT TO VOTE.

02:25:14.572 --> 02:25:15.807
THEN SEVENTEEN IS AN ARBITRARY

02:25:15.873 --> 02:25:17.375
NUMBER.

02:25:17.442 --> 02:25:18.576
BECAUSE WHY NOT GIVE IT TO ALL

02:25:18.643 --> 02:25:19.977
HIGH SCHOOLERS.

02:25:20.044 --> 02:25:21.412
WHO ARE WHO ARE FACING THESE

02:25:21.479 --> 02:25:23.514
ISSUES WHO ARE?

02:25:23.581 --> 02:25:24.849
YOU KNOW WHO CARE ABOUT ALL

02:25:24.916 --> 02:25:27.218
THESE DIFFERENT ISSUES A AND AND

02:25:27.285 --> 02:25:29.053
REALLY ARE ON BOTH SIDES OF THE

02:25:29.120 --> 02:25:30.488
EQUATION.

02:25:30.555 --> 02:25:31.856
YOU KNOW BOTH SIDES OF ISSUES

02:25:31.923 --> 02:25:33.524
THEY'RE THEY'RE CONSERVATIVES OR

02:25:33.591 --> 02:25:35.626
LIBERALS THERE AND MAYBE THEY

02:25:35.693 --> 02:25:36.627
DON'T CARE.

02:25:36.694 --> 02:25:40.098
YOU KNOW -- YOU KNOW SO.

02:25:40.164 --> 02:25:41.766
YOU KNOW SEVENTEEN IS ARBITRARY.

02:25:41.833 --> 02:25:44.602
AND AND IF THE ARGUMENT TRULY IS

02:25:44.669 --> 02:25:45.970
THAT WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT ALL

02:25:46.037 --> 02:25:47.472
THOSE PEOPLE HAVE THE RIGHT TO

02:25:47.538 --> 02:25:49.907
VOICE IN THIS REPUBLIC YOU'RE

02:25:49.974 --> 02:25:51.909
CORRECT SIR IT IS REPUBLIC --

02:25:51.976 --> 02:25:52.810
BECAUSE WE ELECT OUR

02:25:52.877 --> 02:25:55.780
REPRESENTATIVES WHO THEN VOTE ON

02:25:55.847 --> 02:25:58.116
THESE ISSUES FOR US.

02:25:58.182 --> 02:25:59.851
WHY NOT THIRTEEN MIGHT LIKE I

02:25:59.917 --> 02:26:01.385
SAID MY DAUGHTER'S?

02:26:01.452 --> 02:26:02.720
THIRTEEN I HAVE FIVE CHILDREN I

02:26:02.787 --> 02:26:04.088
KNOW THAT WHEN THEY'RE THIRTEEN

02:26:04.155 --> 02:26:05.089
THEY'RE PROBABLY GOING TO BE

02:26:05.156 --> 02:26:07.425
ABLE THEY'LL BE READY TO VOTE.

02:26:07.492 --> 02:26:12.063
YOU KNOW -- AND SO WHY NOT.

02:26:12.130 --> 02:26:13.598
NOT ALL THE WAY UP IF THAT'S THE

02:26:13.664 --> 02:26:14.232
ARGUMENT ONE OF OPEN ALL THE WAY

02:26:14.298 --> 02:26:16.467
UP.

02:26:16.534 --> 02:26:18.136
THIS CHAIR MAYBE MY THROUGH YOU --

02:26:18.202 --> 02:26:19.971
I HAVE TO TWO SEVENTEEN YEAR

02:26:20.037 --> 02:26:22.507
OLDS THAT WOULD LIKE TO PLEASE

02:26:22.573 --> 02:26:25.409
IF THE IF THROUGH.

02:26:25.476 --> 02:26:26.811
YOU'RE SO WHY WHY SHOULD YOU BE

02:26:26.878 --> 02:26:28.379
ON TITLE AND NOT A FRESH MISTER

02:26:28.446 --> 02:26:29.514
VICE CHAIR I THINK WE HEARD THE

02:26:29.580 --> 02:26:30.114
QUESTION YET THANK YOU MISTER

02:26:30.181 --> 02:26:30.781
GALLAGHER AND I'M ACTUALLY HAPPY

02:26:30.848 --> 02:26:31.382
THAT YOU ASKED THAT QUESTION

02:26:31.449 --> 02:26:31.983
BECAUSE THERE ARE VERY GOOD

02:26:32.049 --> 02:26:32.917
REASONS WHY SEVENTEEN SHOULD BE

02:26:32.984 --> 02:26:33.784
THE AGE.

02:26:33.851 --> 02:26:35.219
FIRST IS THAT WE'RE TAKING OUR

02:26:35.286 --> 02:26:36.554
CIVICS CLASSES IN THEIR SENIOR

02:26:36.621 --> 02:26:37.955
YEARS WERE ACTUALLY LEARNING

02:26:38.022 --> 02:26:39.290
ABOUT GOVERNMENT AND I WE

02:26:39.357 --> 02:26:40.358
ACTUALLY I DID A PRE

02:26:40.424 --> 02:26:42.293
REGISTRATION DRIVE AT MY SCHOOL

02:26:42.360 --> 02:26:43.628
TO KIND OF FINISH UP OUR AP GOV.

02:26:43.694 --> 02:26:45.196
AND THAT WAS A REALLY GOOD WAY

02:26:45.263 --> 02:26:46.130
TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO GET MORE

02:26:46.197 --> 02:26:48.166
INVOLVED IN CIVICS AND I THINK

02:26:48.232 --> 02:26:50.101
THAT IF WE COULD AND THE YEAR OF

02:26:50.168 --> 02:26:52.103
SENIOR YEAR WITH -- REGISTERING

02:26:52.170 --> 02:26:53.704
STUDENTS TO VOTE ON THAT WOULD

02:26:53.771 --> 02:26:55.139
BE A GREAT WAY TO SEND THEM OFF

02:26:55.206 --> 02:26:56.974
INTO OUR SOCIETY IN A WAY WHERE

02:26:57.041 --> 02:26:58.209
THEY CAN PARTICIPATE FULLY.

02:26:58.276 --> 02:26:59.810
THE SECOND IS THAT SEVENTEEN YOU

02:26:59.877 --> 02:27:01.445
CAN BE TRIED AS AN ADULT AND I

02:27:01.512 --> 02:27:02.647
PERSONALLY BELIEVE THAT IF YOU

02:27:02.713 --> 02:27:04.615
CAN BE TRIED AS AN ADULT -- THAT

02:27:04.682 --> 02:27:06.484
YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO VOTE AS

02:27:06.551 --> 02:27:07.218
WELL.

02:27:07.285 --> 02:27:09.353
THIRD IS THAT WHEN YOU'RE

02:27:09.420 --> 02:27:09.921
SEVENTEEN YOU'RE ALLOWED TO

02:27:09.987 --> 02:27:11.355
OPERATE HEAVY DANGEROUS

02:27:11.422 --> 02:27:12.924
MACHINERY AND YOU'RE ALLOWED TO

02:27:12.990 --> 02:27:14.192
DRIVE WITH OTHER PEOPLE IN YOUR

02:27:14.258 --> 02:27:16.294
CAR AND SO YOU ACTUALLY HAVE

02:27:16.360 --> 02:27:17.628
OTHER PEOPLE'S LIVES IN YOUR

02:27:17.695 --> 02:27:19.130
HANDS WE ARE SIXTEEN ALSO KNOW

02:27:19.197 --> 02:27:20.164
AT SIXTEEN YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO

02:27:20.231 --> 02:27:23.034
DRIVE OTHER PEOPLE IN YOUR CAR.

02:27:23.100 --> 02:27:23.834
YOU'RE ONLY A DRY ALLOWED YOU

02:27:23.901 --> 02:27:30.074
LIVE ALONE IN YOUR CAR YES SIR.

02:27:30.141 --> 02:27:31.409
YEAH AND TO KIND OF ADD ON TO

02:27:31.475 --> 02:27:32.210
THAT GREAT POINTS.

02:27:32.276 --> 02:27:33.511
AS A SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD YOUR

02:27:33.578 --> 02:27:34.111
YOUR TAKING AN AP GOVERNMENT

02:27:34.178 --> 02:27:35.213
CLASS OR SOME SORT OF GOVERNMENT

02:27:35.279 --> 02:27:36.113
CLASS SO.

02:27:36.180 --> 02:27:36.781
IT IN OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM RIGHT

02:27:36.847 --> 02:27:38.449
NOW IT IN IN MY PERSONAL OPINION.

02:27:38.516 --> 02:27:39.016
CIVIC ENGAGEMENT AND CIVIC

02:27:39.083 --> 02:27:40.985
EDUCATION IS NOT PLACED AS A

02:27:41.052 --> 02:27:43.187
PRIORITY BUT IF VOTING AGE OF

02:27:43.254 --> 02:27:44.088
SEVENTEEN AND HIGH SCHOOL SENIOR

02:27:44.155 --> 02:27:45.690
FOR VOTING IN OUR ELECTIONS THAT

02:27:45.756 --> 02:27:46.424
WOULD GO TO THE TOP OF THE

02:27:46.490 --> 02:27:47.858
PRIORITY LIST OF OUR GOVERNMENT

02:27:47.925 --> 02:27:48.292
CLASSES.

02:27:48.359 --> 02:27:49.293
AND THIS WOULD GIVE HIGH SCHOOL

02:27:49.360 --> 02:27:50.394
STUDENTS WHO ARE SEVENTEEN YEARS

02:27:50.461 --> 02:27:52.230

THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY

02:28:05.042 --> 02:28:05.876
ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS

02:28:05.943 --> 02:28:06.544
HOW WOULD YOU SAY IN THE EIGHTH

02:28:06.611 --> 02:28:07.178
GRADE.

02:28:07.245 --> 02:28:09.180
WE STUDY THE U. S. CONSTITUTION

02:28:09.247 --> 02:28:10.615
AND SO EIGHTH GRADERS BY THE

02:28:10.681 --> 02:28:12.083
TIME THEY'VE GRADUATED GRADING

02:28:12.149 --> 02:28:13.417
GOING INTO HIGH SCHOOL HAVE

02:28:13.484 --> 02:28:14.885
STUDIED R. U. S.

02:28:14.952 --> 02:28:16.621
CONSTITUTIONALLY SIR SUPPOSED --

02:28:16.687 --> 02:28:18.089

02:28:18.155 --> 02:28:19.557
OUR GOVERNMENT SO.

02:28:19.624 --> 02:28:21.826
SO THERE I MEAN IT'S NOT JUST

02:28:21.892 --> 02:28:22.627
SEVENTEEN THAT WE LEARNED CIVICS

02:28:22.693 --> 02:28:23.761
WE LEARN IT THROUGHOUT OUR

02:28:23.828 --> 02:28:25.396
EDUCATION SO YOU CAN MAKE THE

02:28:25.463 --> 02:28:27.398
ARGUMENT FOR FOURTEEN YEAR OLDS

02:28:27.465 --> 02:28:30.668
ALL -- AGAIN IT TO YOUR POINT

02:28:30.735 --> 02:28:33.938
ABOUT -- NOW WHAT WAS THE WHAT

02:28:34.005 --> 02:28:37.041
WAS YOUR SECOND POINT GO AHEAD.

02:28:37.108 --> 02:28:40.244
YEAH KNOW YOUR SECOND POINT ONE

02:28:40.311 --> 02:28:42.446
WAS ABOUT CIVIC CENTER RIGHT --

02:28:42.513 --> 02:28:43.914
ONE WAS ABOUT CIVICS -- ABOUT

02:28:43.981 --> 02:28:45.983
BEING TRIED AS AN ADULT BUT WE

02:28:46.050 --> 02:28:47.952
ALSO OF THIS BODY AGAIN I YOU

02:28:48.019 --> 02:28:49.320
MAY BE HEARD ME EARLIER.

02:28:49.387 --> 02:28:51.122
THIS BODY IS SAID WE DON'T HOLD

02:28:51.188 --> 02:28:52.923
YOU TO THE SAME ACCOUNT IF YOU

02:28:52.990 --> 02:28:55.026
COMMIT A CRIME BETWEEN THE AGES

02:28:55.092 --> 02:28:56.661
OF EIGHTEEN AND TWENTY FIVE

02:28:56.727 --> 02:28:58.529
BECAUSE THE JUSTIFICATION IS YOU

02:28:58.596 --> 02:29:00.731
DON'T HAVE GOOD ENOUGH JUDGMENT.

02:29:00.798 --> 02:29:02.800
IN THAT TIME YOUR BRAINS HAVE

02:29:02.867 --> 02:29:03.801
NOT DEVELOPED.

02:29:03.868 --> 02:29:05.936
WELL ENOUGH SO THE ARGUMENT

02:29:06.003 --> 02:29:07.505
WOULD SEEM TO BE AGAINST.

02:29:07.571 --> 02:29:08.105
GIVING YOU THE RIGHT TO VOTE I

02:29:08.172 --> 02:29:09.273
MEAN.

02:29:09.340 --> 02:29:10.541
THE RIGHT TO VOTE IS A POWERFUL

02:29:10.608 --> 02:29:12.276
THING RIGHT IT'S IT YOU DO HAVE

02:29:12.343 --> 02:29:13.477

02:29:14.779 --> 02:29:16.113
DECISION TO SEND SOMEONE TO THE

02:29:16.180 --> 02:29:17.114
DEATH PENALTY YOU VOTE ON A

02:29:17.181 --> 02:29:18.683
GOVERNOR WHO HAS THE ABILITY TO

02:29:18.749 --> 02:29:20.284
PARDON.

02:29:20.351 --> 02:29:22.687
YES IT IS A SERIOUS OBLIGATION

02:29:22.753 --> 02:29:24.455
WAS HE LIKE YOU COULD MAKE.

02:29:24.522 --> 02:29:26.590
THAT THAT ARGUMENT. TO SAY THAT

02:29:26.657 --> 02:29:28.092
IT SHOULD BE OLDER.

02:29:28.159 --> 02:29:29.927
UNDER THAT LOGIC RIGHT I CAN

02:29:29.994 --> 02:29:31.562
ALSO UNDER THE SAME LOGIC SAY

02:29:31.629 --> 02:29:33.297

IT JUST CRAZY AND BECAUSE OF THE

02:54:03.166 --> 02:54:04.834
WAY THAT WE WANT BECAUSE OF THE

02:54:04.901 --> 02:54:06.235
WAY THAT THE RULES WERE WRITTEN.

02:54:06.302 --> 02:54:07.270
ON THERE JUST WASN'T ENOUGH

02:54:07.336 --> 02:54:08.738

TO ALLOW FOR CONSOLIDATION.

02:54:10.439 --> 02:54:11.474
SO THIS JUST GIVES A LITTLE BIT

02:54:11.541 --> 02:54:13.976
MORE FLEXIBILITY I WANTED ALSO

02:54:14.043 --> 02:54:15.511
KIND OF EXPANDED OUT TO MAKE IT

02:54:15.578 --> 02:54:16.546
SO THAT THE ELECTION COULD BE

02:54:16.612 --> 02:54:18.648
DECLARED EARLIER BUT WE WE GOT A

02:54:18.714 --> 02:54:20.183
LOT OF CONCERNS FROM OUR CLERKS

02:54:20.249 --> 02:54:21.984

02:54:22.652 --> 02:54:25.121
FLEXIBILITY SO AS TO ALLOW FOR A

02:54:25.188 --> 02:54:27.390
LITTLE BIT MORE COHERENCE. TO TO

02:54:55.952 --> 02:54:57.320
OF YOUR?

YOUR YOUR QUANDARY IN LA COUNTY

02:54:58.888 --> 02:54:59.856
MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT IT

02:54:59.922 --> 02:55:01.724
WOULD HAVE ALLOWED FROM FOR ONE

02:55:01.791 --> 02:55:04.026
CONSOLIDATION IN THAT CASE -- SO

02:55:04.093 --> 02:55:04.927
YEAH IT'S NOT IT'S NOT IT'S NOT

02:55:04.994 --> 02:55:06.195
THE MOST EARTH SHATTERING BILL

02:55:06.262 --> 02:55:07.830
BUT IF IT SAVES.

02:55:07.897 --> 02:55:10.366
I BOTH THE TAXPAYERS -- THE

02:55:10.433 --> 02:55:11.534
EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH ONE

02:55:11.601 --> 02:55:12.768
ADDITIONAL SPECIAL ELECTION

02:55:12.835 --> 02:55:15.938
NEEDLESSLY -- THAT CAN ACTUALLY

02:55:16.005 --> 02:55:18.441
ALLOW FOR A LITTLE BIT MORE TURN

02:55:18.507 --> 02:55:18.708
OUT FROM.

02:55:18.774 --> 02:55:21.510
MAYBE. 7% 212%.

02:55:21.577 --> 02:55:22.178
I THINK IT WILL HAVE BEEN

02:55:22.245 --> 02:55:23.846
WORTHWHILE AND FOR AN INDIAN THE

02:55:23.913 --> 02:55:24.380
ONLY OTHER CONCERN THAT.

02:55:24.447 --> 02:55:25.548
IS THE OTHER THE FLIP SIDE OF

02:55:25.615 --> 02:55:26.916
THAT IS WHEN WE LOSE WHEN WE

02:55:33.522 --> 02:55:34.724
THINGS GET DRAGGED OUT.

02:55:34.790 --> 02:55:36.893

SB ONE FORTY NINE AND TWENTY

03:06:56.371 --> 03:06:56.872
SEVENTEEN WE QUESTIONED THE

03:06:56.939 --> 03:07:00.742
TACTICS BEHIND A NEW BALLAD

03:07:00.809 --> 03:07:01.043
[inaudible]

03:07:01.109 --> 03:07:02.611
QUALIFYING REQUIREMENT.

03:07:02.678 --> 03:07:05.681
WHICH IS A DEFINITION BI.

03:07:05.747 --> 03:07:08.050
DEFINITION A POLL TAX.

03:07:08.116 --> 03:07:10.218
BECAUSE IT APPEARS TO SINGLE OUT

03:07:10.285 --> 03:07:12.187
CANDIDATES THAT HAVE A DIFFERENT

03:07:12.254 --> 03:07:13.522
VISION.

03:07:13.589 --> 03:07:16.858
OF GOVERNING NOT TO MENTION.

03:07:16.925 --> 03:07:19.928
IT DISREGARDS THE CIVIL RIGHTS.

03:07:19.995 --> 03:07:22.130
A BOTH THE CANDIDATES.

03:07:22.197 --> 03:07:23.432
AND THOSE.

03:07:23.498 --> 03:07:26.335
WHO ARE VOTING?

03:07:26.401 --> 03:07:28.070
IN CALIFORNIA IT IS AGAINST THE

03:07:28.136 --> 03:07:29.104
LAW TO DO VIEWPOINT

03:07:29.171 --> 03:07:31.306
DISCRIMINATION.

03:07:31.373 --> 03:07:33.542
WE THINK SB TWENTY SEVEN IS.

03:07:33.609 --> 03:07:35.577
DISCRIMINATION.

03:07:35.644 --> 03:07:37.579
BECAUSE IT SUDDENLY REQUIRES

03:07:37.646 --> 03:07:40.015
FINANCIAL TAX FILINGS UNDER THE

03:07:40.082 --> 03:07:41.650
FATE REASON.

03:07:41.717 --> 03:07:43.218
OF MORE TRANSPARENCY IN AND

03:07:43.285 --> 03:07:46.455

OUT ANYTHING GENERALLY CAN?

03:07:55.764 --> 03:07:58.333
SO THIS FEEBLE ATTEMPT TO GIVE

03:07:58.400 --> 03:08:00.235
MORE INFORMATION IS JUST SMOKE

03:08:00.302 --> 03:08:01.503

03:15:56.411 --> 03:15:59.647
AFFECT I'VE LOST MY I LOST IT

03:15:59.714 --> 03:16:01.116
HERE YOU HAVE IT YEAH.

03:16:01.182 --> 03:16:03.785
HERE IT IS SAYS -- TWO POINT

03:16:03.852 --> 03:16:04.385

03:16:04.452 --> 03:16:05.553
THEIR FATHER THEY GAVE IS -- AS

03:16:05.620 --> 03:16:06.654
DESCRIBED ABOVE WE CONCLUDE THAT

03:16:06.721 --> 03:16:08.123
A COURT WOULD MORE LIKELY THAN

03:16:09.858 --> 03:16:10.291

03:16:12.227 --> 03:16:13.328

03:16:13.394 --> 03:16:13.862
AND IT APPEARS TO HAVE THE

03:16:13.928 --> 03:16:14.863
PURPOSE OF CREATING A

03:16:14.929 --> 03:16:16.164
QUALIFICATION INDIRECTLY NAY

03:16:16.231 --> 03:16:18.299

THE CONSTITUTION IT WOULDN'T BE

03:16:21.069 --> 03:16:23.138
MET I THINK THAT'S WHY THIS WAS

03:16:23.204 --> 03:16:24.539
VETOED BY THE FORMER

03:16:24.606 --> 03:16:26.207
ADMINISTRATION CAN YOU TALK

ABOUT THAT A LITTLE BIT AND AND

03:16:28.877 --> 03:16:29.410
IT WOULD MAKE A WHOLE LOT OF

03:16:29.477 --> 03:16:30.245
SENSE FOR US TO GO THROUGH THE

03:16:30.311 --> 03:16:31.946
PROCESS HERE IF -- IF THIS ENDED

03:16:32.013 --> 03:16:33.882
UP GOING THROUGH THE COURTS IN

03:16:33.948 --> 03:16:35.150
IT BEING -- RULED

03:16:35.216 --> 03:16:36.417

THIS ONE SAY.

03:16:42.423 --> 03:16:44.025
THANK YOU FOR ALL OF THE

03:16:44.092 --> 03:16:45.827
TESTIMONY HERE TODAY AND I THINK

03:16:45.894 --> 03:16:51.032
THAT IT'S CLEAR THAT THERE ARE --

03:16:51.099 --> 03:16:52.967
ISSUES AND OPINIONS ON ALL SIDES.

03:16:53.034 --> 03:16:53.935
BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS THIS.

03:16:54.002 --> 03:16:55.103
POLL AFTER POLL SHOWS THAT

03:16:55.170 --> 03:16:56.638
NEARLY TWO THIRDS OF AMERICANS

03:16:56.704 --> 03:16:59.274
WANT THE PRESIDENT NOT JUST

03:16:59.340 --> 03:17:00.141
PRESIDENT TRUMP BUT WHAT THE

03:17:00.208 --> 03:17:01.709
PRESIDENT HAD A RELEASED HIS OR

03:17:01.776 --> 03:17:02.944
HER TAX RETURNS.

03:17:03.011 --> 03:17:04.312
THERE ARE A VARIETY OF LEGAL

03:17:04.379 --> 03:17:05.580
OPINIONS.

03:17:05.647 --> 03:17:07.115
ON THIS ISSUE WOULD LIKE TO BE

03:17:07.182 --> 03:17:09.217
TO TALK TO THE CONSTITUTIONALITY

03:17:09.284 --> 03:17:10.552
OF THE BILL -- AND THEN ALSO

03:17:10.618 --> 03:17:12.320
TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE SCHOLARS

03:17:12.387 --> 03:17:14.088
WHO HAVE LOOKED AT THIS BILL.

03:17:14.155 --> 03:17:14.923
SO IT'S IMPORTANT TO BE ABLE TO

03:17:14.989 --> 03:17:16.724
KNOW WHERE IT STATES HAVE THE

03:17:16.791 --> 03:17:19.027

REQUIREMENTS OR WE DO NOT.

03:17:20.228 --> 03:17:21.462
SO IT'S VERY CLEAR WHERE THE

03:17:21.529 --> 03:17:23.198
CITY CALIFORNIA HAS THE ABILITY

03:17:23.264 --> 03:17:25.033
TO IMPOSE BALLOT ACCESS

03:17:25.099 --> 03:17:25.867

03:17:25.934 --> 03:17:27.802
IT WOULD BE -- INCLUDING

03:17:27.869 --> 03:17:29.537
RELEASING YOUR TAX RETURNS

03:17:29.604 --> 03:17:32.307
BECAUSE IT'S NOT TARGETED TO ONE

03:17:32.373 --> 03:17:34.642
INDIVIDUAL.

03:17:34.709 --> 03:17:35.843
OR ONE CANDID.

03:17:35.910 --> 03:17:37.512
IF IT IS EQUAL OPPORTUNITY.

03:17:37.579 --> 03:17:39.447
IN IN THIS BILL IT'S ONLY FOCUS

03:17:39.514 --> 03:17:40.782
ON THE MARCH PRIMARY.

03:17:40.848 --> 03:17:42.150
THE REASON WHY IT'S FOLKS IN THE

03:17:42.217 --> 03:17:43.251
MARCH PRIMARY BECAUSE STATES

03:17:43.318 --> 03:17:44.819

03:17:48.489 --> 03:17:50.124
BALLOT ACCESS REQUIREMENTS IN

03:17:50.191 --> 03:17:51.226
OUR PRIMARY.

03:17:51.292 --> 03:17:53.261
WE DO NOT IN THE GENERAL BECAUSE

03:17:53.328 --> 03:17:54.729
THAT'S UP TO THE POLITICAL PARTY.

03:17:54.796 --> 03:17:55.997
WHETHER IT'S THE REPUBLICANS THE

03:17:56.064 --> 03:17:57.432

LIBERTARIANS YOU NAME.

03:17:58.933 --> 03:17:59.334
AND IT IS IN THE STATE

03:17:59.400 --> 03:18:00.568
CONSTITUTION.

03:18:00.635 --> 03:18:02.237
LET'S DEFINE ABOUT ACCESS

FOR THE SECRETARY STATE.

03:18:08.543 --> 03:18:11.412
AND RELEASING YOUR TAX RETURNS.

03:18:11.479 --> 03:18:12.614
WE HAVE LANGUAGE WITHIN THE BILL

03:18:12.680 --> 03:18:14.749
THIS IS IF YOU DO NOT PAY TAXES

03:18:14.816 --> 03:18:16.584
YOU CAN STILL GET ON THE BALLOT

03:18:16.651 --> 03:18:18.286

IF YOU DON'T FILE TAXES.

03:18:24.359 --> 03:18:25.860
I WILL SHARE WITH YOU THERE ARE

03:18:25.927 --> 03:18:27.362
THREE DEMOCRATS THUS FAR THEY

03:18:27.428 --> 03:18:28.529
HAVE NOT SHARED THEIR TAX

03:18:28.596 --> 03:18:30.098
RETURNS FOR THE PUBLIC.

03:18:30.164 --> 03:18:32.200
THOSE THREE WOULD NOT APPEAR ON

03:18:32.267 --> 03:18:34.235
THE MARCH PRIMARY BALLOT.

03:18:34.302 --> 03:18:36.504
ALONG AND IF HE CHOOSES

03:18:36.571 --> 03:18:39.374
PRESIDENT TRUMP -- AND IT'S ALSO

03:18:39.440 --> 03:18:41.242
IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT FOR THE

PAST FORTY YEARS PAST FORTY

03:18:43.578 --> 03:18:44.412

HAVE RELEASE OUR TAX RETURNS.

03:18:50.985 --> 03:18:52.954
THIS BILL HAS BEEN LOOKED AT BY

03:18:53.021 --> 03:18:55.356
THE FORMER ETHICS ATTORNEY FOR

03:18:55.423 --> 03:18:57.158

AND I ALSO BELIEVE THAT IT

SHOULD BE CHALLENGED IN COURT.

03:19:15.243 --> 03:19:16.711
BECAUSE NO MATTER IF YOU ARE A

DEMOCRAT OR YOU'RE REPUBLICAN.

03:19:19.414 --> 03:19:21.015
YOU SHOULD PUT YOUR NATION

BEFORE YOUR POLITICS IN YOUR

03:19:22.917 --> 03:19:24.385

CONFLICT OF INTEREST LIES.

03:19:54.082 --> 03:19:55.183
THE PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT

03:19:55.249 --> 03:19:56.718
ALL OF US WHOARE SITTING HERE

03:19:56.784 --> 03:19:58.453
TODAY ARE SUBJECT TO THE

03:19:58.519 --> 03:19:59.654
CONFLICT OF INTEREST LIES.

03:19:59.721 --> 03:20:01.789
IF YOU SIT ON THE SAN JOSE CITY

03:20:01.856 --> 03:20:03.091
COUNCIL.

03:20:03.157 --> 03:20:04.592
THE SACRAMENTO CITY COUNCIL THE

03:20:04.659 --> 03:20:06.527
BOARD OF SUPERVISORS OR SCHOOL

03:20:06.594 --> 03:20:08.930

03:20:08.996 --> 03:20:09.731

03:20:12.967 --> 03:20:14.836
AS A LOCAL ELECTED A MEMBER OF

THE SCHOOL BOARD ANY DO AS

03:20:16.037 --> 03:20:17.672
PRESIDENT BY THE PRESIDENT OF

THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

03:20:18.506 --> 03:20:20.708
BECAUSE YOU'RE SUBJECT TO

03:20:20.775 --> 03:20:21.509
CONFLICT OF INTEREST LAWS.

03:20:21.576 --> 03:20:23.211
SO I BELIEVE THAT WE WILL

03:20:23.277 --> 03:20:24.412
WITHSTAND ACOSTA SHORTENING

03:20:24.479 --> 03:20:25.947
THERE ARE GOING TO BE ATTORNEYS

03:20:26.013 --> 03:20:27.548
OUT THERE THAT SAY THAT WE WON'T --

03:20:27.615 --> 03:20:28.916
AND I DO BELIEVE THAT THEY

03:20:28.983 --> 03:20:30.451
SHOULD BE TESTED IN THE COURTS.

03:20:30.518 --> 03:20:32.286
THANK YOU VERY MUCH IF I JUST

03:20:32.353 --> 03:20:33.287
CANDICE TO THE FOLLOW UP.

03:20:33.354 --> 03:20:34.789
YOU KNOW WE TALK ABOUT THIS

03:20:34.856 --> 03:20:35.757
BEING A PARTISAN ISSUE IN FACT I

03:20:35.823 --> 03:20:37.392
EVEN IN THIS COMMITTEE I DON'T

03:20:37.458 --> 03:20:38.826
LIKE THE FACT WE TALK ABOUT

03:20:38.893 --> 03:20:40.294
BEING REPUBLICAN OR DEMOCRAT --

03:20:40.361 --> 03:20:42.530
WE THE THE GOAL HERE IS TO TRY

03:20:42.597 --> 03:20:44.065
TO CREATE A SOME RULES THAT

03:20:44.132 --> 03:20:46.467
EVERYBODY HAS TO TO TO ABIDE BY.

03:20:46.534 --> 03:20:50.071
WHAT IS DISTURBING TO ME IS THAT

03:20:50.138 --> 03:20:51.172
IF THE?

03:20:51.239 --> 03:20:52.707
IF THE SHE WAS ON THE OTHER FOOT

03:20:52.774 --> 03:20:53.775
AND WE HAD A DEMOCRATIC

03:20:53.841 --> 03:20:55.176
PRESIDENT WHO WOULD NOT RELEASE

03:20:55.243 --> 03:20:57.245
IS RETURNS -- I CAN TELL YOU

03:20:57.311 --> 03:20:59.313
THERE'D BE OUTRAGE -- AMONG

03:20:59.380 --> 03:21:00.715
SPOKES ON ON THE RIGHT.

03:21:00.782 --> 03:21:04.051
AND SO THE THE ISSUE IS THE

03:21:04.118 --> 03:21:06.254
PRESENT SHE RELEASES TAX RETURNS --

03:21:06.320 --> 03:21:07.688
THE QUESTION FOR ME IS WHETHER

03:21:07.755 --> 03:21:09.824
THIS IS CONSTITUTIONAL OR NOT --

03:21:09.891 --> 03:21:10.892
AND THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT THAT

03:21:10.958 --> 03:21:13.461
MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR ME -- BUT

03:21:13.528 --> 03:21:15.296
THE FIVE IF IF THOSE FOLKS BACK

03:21:15.363 --> 03:21:17.331
IN WASHINGTON DC WERE WATCHING --

03:21:17.398 --> 03:21:18.566
I THINK WE ALL AS AMERICANS IS

03:21:18.633 --> 03:21:19.901
CALIFORNIANS BELIEVE THAT THE

03:21:19.967 --> 03:21:25.773
PRESENT I'D STATE SHOULD

03:21:25.840 --> 03:21:27.508
RELEASES RETURNS.

03:21:27.575 --> 03:21:28.843
IF IT'S OKAY WITH FUTURE WHAT I

03:21:28.910 --> 03:21:29.911
WOULD SAY AND THE IN I REALLY

03:21:30.578 --> 03:21:31.112
THAT FORWARD.

03:21:31.179 --> 03:21:32.380
WE HEARD A LOT OF FEEDBACK.

03:21:32.447 --> 03:21:33.981
ABOUT PARTISANSHIP.

03:21:34.048 --> 03:21:34.749
THAT'S WHY WE'RE BACKING FUNNY

03:21:34.816 --> 03:21:36.050
TODAY INCLUDING THE GOVERNOR THE

03:21:36.117 --> 03:21:36.684
GOVERNOR CALIFORNIA.

03:21:36.751 --> 03:21:37.185
BY THE WAY THE GOVERNOR

03:21:37.251 --> 03:21:39.587
CALIFORNIA HAS LEAD BY EXAMPLE

03:21:39.654 --> 03:21:41.756
RELEASE HIS TAX RETURNS.

03:21:41.823 --> 03:21:43.191
RELEASE THE SAME INFORMATION

03:21:43.257 --> 03:21:44.492
THAT IS READ THAT WOULD BE

03:21:44.559 --> 03:21:46.627
REQUIRED OF ANY PRESIDENT UNDER

03:21:46.694 --> 03:21:47.929
THIS BILL.

03:21:47.995 --> 03:21:49.530
SO NOW REQUIRED IN THIS BILL

03:21:49.597 --> 03:21:50.998
WOULD BE THE DEMOCRATIC GOVERNOR

03:21:51.065 --> 03:21:52.366

VICE PRESIDENT PENCE.

03:21:57.638 --> 03:21:59.307
AND I WILL SHARE WITH YOU THAT

03:21:59.373 --> 03:22:00.975
IF HILLARY CLINTON HAD WON THIS

03:22:01.042 --> 03:22:02.643
RACE.

03:22:02.710 --> 03:22:04.111
OUT WE WOULD BE HERE PRESENTING

03:22:04.178 --> 03:22:05.179
THIS BILL.

03:22:05.246 --> 03:22:07.882
BECAUSE IT'S ABOUT SETTING SIGN

03:22:07.949 --> 03:22:08.516
YOUR PERSONAL BELIEFS AND BEING

03:22:08.583 --> 03:22:09.951
A PATRIOT.

03:22:10.017 --> 03:22:11.285
IN BEING TRANSPARENT IN

03:22:11.352 --> 03:22:12.820
RELEASING YOUR RETURNS AND BY

03:22:12.887 --> 03:22:14.155
THE WAY THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THE

03:22:14.222 --> 03:22:15.957
AMERICAN PEOPLE ON OUR SIDE ON

03:22:16.023 --> 03:22:17.758
THIS ISSUE.

03:22:17.825 --> 03:22:18.493
THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR VICE

03:22:18.559 --> 03:22:18.860
CHAIR.

03:22:18.926 --> 03:22:20.628
YES SO I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE

03:22:20.695 --> 03:22:22.330
THE AUTHOR WE WORKED A LOT OF

03:22:22.396 --> 03:22:24.532
DIFFERENT THINGS TOGETHER HE TO

03:22:24.599 --> 03:22:25.466
YOU KNOW.

03:22:25.533 --> 03:22:26.100
YEAH I THINK THE PROBLEM HERE IS

03:22:26.167 --> 03:22:27.502
THAT YOU'RE NOT DOING THIS IN A

03:22:27.568 --> 03:22:30.438
VACUUM YOU KNOW -- AND EVEN

03:22:30.505 --> 03:22:32.273
WITHOUT IN THE GOVERNOR IT LIKE

03:22:32.340 --> 03:22:33.908
IT THE CONTEXT OF WAR AND

03:22:33.975 --> 03:22:35.676
THERE'S ONLY ONE PERSON ONLY PER

03:22:35.743 --> 03:22:36.444
ONE PRESIDENT WHO HASN'T

03:22:36.511 --> 03:22:37.378
RELEASED.

03:22:37.445 --> 03:22:39.280
HIS TAX RETURNS RIGHT AND SO IT

03:22:39.347 --> 03:22:40.882
LOOKS VERY POLITICAL AND IT

03:22:40.948 --> 03:22:42.316
DOESN'T LOOK LIKE IT'S AN EVEN

03:22:42.383 --> 03:22:44.385
HANDED APPROACH -- AND I THINK

03:22:44.452 --> 03:22:45.920
THAT'S THE PROBLEM LIKE IF YOU

03:22:45.987 --> 03:22:47.622
IF YOU WERE DOING THIS IN A

03:22:47.688 --> 03:22:51.893
CONTEXT WHERE -- YELLED ALL ALL --

03:22:51.959 --> 03:22:53.561
ALL ALL CANDIDATES HAD.

03:22:53.628 --> 03:22:54.996
RELEASED THEIR TAX RETURNS OR

03:22:55.062 --> 03:22:56.364
ALL CANDIDATES HAD RELEASE OUR

03:22:56.430 --> 03:22:58.299
TAX RETURNS THAT THAT MIGHT BE

03:22:58.366 --> 03:23:00.434
ONE THING -- BUT WE'RE OBVIOUSLY

03:23:00.501 --> 03:23:01.702
OPERATE IN A CONTEXT THAT

03:23:01.769 --> 03:23:02.670
SOMETHING THAT IS GOING TO GET

03:23:02.737 --> 03:23:04.138
TAKE INTO ACCOUNT BY A COURT

03:23:04.205 --> 03:23:06.707
ABSOLUTELY -- I ALSO THINK LIKE

03:23:06.774 --> 03:23:09.644
WERE ALSO IN THIS CONTEXT OF

03:23:09.710 --> 03:23:10.912
TALKING ABOUT PRIVACY.

03:23:10.978 --> 03:23:11.546
AND HOW IMPORTANT THAT IS AND

03:23:11.612 --> 03:23:13.714
HOW WE DON'T WANT YOU KNOW OUR

03:23:13.781 --> 03:23:15.016
PRIVACY.

03:23:15.082 --> 03:23:16.984
AS CONSUMERS AS CONSUMERS

03:23:17.051 --> 03:23:18.386
CERTAINLY WHEN OUR PEOPLE SIGN

03:23:18.452 --> 03:23:18.953
OUR INFORMATION WITHOUT OUR

03:23:19.020 --> 03:23:19.854
CONSENT.

03:23:19.921 --> 03:23:20.922
AND I DON'T THINK THAT WE GIVE

03:23:20.988 --> 03:23:22.623
UP ALL SENSE OF PRIVACY AS

03:23:22.690 --> 03:23:24.025
PEOPLE WHO ARE PUBLIC FIGURES WE

03:23:24.091 --> 03:23:25.660
DON'T GIVE UP ALL SENSE OF

03:23:25.726 --> 03:23:26.727
PRIVACY.

03:23:26.794 --> 03:23:28.896
WHEN WE RUN FOR OFFICE -- ALL OF

03:23:28.963 --> 03:23:30.965
US DO FILE STATEMENTS OF

03:23:31.032 --> 03:23:32.166
ECONOMIC INTEREST.

03:23:32.233 --> 03:23:33.935
SO DO THE FEDERAL CANDIDATES AS

03:23:34.001 --> 03:23:36.337
WELL SO EVERYBODY CAN SEE WHAT

03:23:36.404 --> 03:23:38.272
THEY HAVE INTEREST IN -- BUT TO

03:23:38.339 --> 03:23:39.774
ME MA'AM MY TAX RETURNS OR

03:23:39.840 --> 03:23:42.043
NOBODY ELSE'S BUSINESS PERIOD.

03:23:42.109 --> 03:23:43.578
AND I'M NOT GOING TO REQUIRE OF

03:23:43.644 --> 03:23:44.679
SOMEBODY ELSE SOMETHING I

03:23:44.745 --> 03:23:46.614
WOULDN'T EXPECT.

03:23:46.681 --> 03:23:48.916
OF MYSELF -- AND CERTAINLY I I

03:23:48.983 --> 03:23:49.750
THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD HAVE

03:23:49.817 --> 03:23:52.587
PROBLEMS APPEAR RELEASING YOUR

03:23:52.653 --> 03:23:53.788
PRIVATE TAX RETURNS -- OF

03:23:53.854 --> 03:23:55.222
TALKING ABOUT WHAT DEDUCTIONS

03:23:55.289 --> 03:23:56.991
YOU'VE TAKEN AND AND YOU KNOW

03:23:57.058 --> 03:23:58.426
WHAT YOU KNOW HOW MUCH MONEY

03:23:58.492 --> 03:24:00.528
YOU'VE MADE I MEAN I TO ME

03:24:00.595 --> 03:24:02.463
THAT'S NOBODY'S BUSINESS -- YES

03:24:02.530 --> 03:24:03.764
PRESIDENTS HAVE TRADITIONALLY

03:24:03.831 --> 03:24:06.233
DONE THAT THAT'S A TRADITION NOW

03:24:06.300 --> 03:24:07.535
IT'S NOT A LEGAL REQUIREMENT.

03:24:07.602 --> 03:24:09.570
AND THEN LASTLY WE TALK ABOUT

03:24:09.637 --> 03:24:12.273
THIS A LOT THIS COMMITTEE VOTER

03:24:12.340 --> 03:24:13.441
SUPPRESSION.

03:24:13.507 --> 03:24:14.408
THIS WOULD CAUSE VOTER

03:24:14.475 --> 03:24:15.977
SUPPRESSION IF YOU HAVE.

03:24:16.043 --> 03:24:17.878
LOOKED DONALD TRUMP IS GOING TO

03:24:17.945 --> 03:24:19.246
BE THE REPUBLICAN.

03:24:19.313 --> 03:24:21.816
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE OKAY --

03:24:21.882 --> 03:24:23.150
HE'S GONNA BE ON THE BALLOT IF

03:24:23.217 --> 03:24:24.485
IF IN MARCH.

03:24:24.552 --> 03:24:25.853
BECAUSE OF THIS PROVISION HE'S

03:24:25.920 --> 03:24:27.288
NOT ALLOWED TO BE ON THE BALLOT

03:24:27.355 --> 03:24:28.255
IT'S GOING TO MEAN THAT

03:24:28.322 --> 03:24:30.191
REPUBLICAN VOTERS HAVE NO NO

03:24:30.257 --> 03:24:31.726
REASON TO TURN OUT.

03:24:31.792 --> 03:24:33.594
WHICH WHICH AFFECTS EVERY DOWN

03:24:33.661 --> 03:24:35.096
BALLOT RACE.

03:24:35.162 --> 03:24:36.664
AM IN IS A HUGE VOTE AND IF IT

03:24:36.731 --> 03:24:37.765
WERE IF THE SHOE WERE ON THE

03:24:37.832 --> 03:24:39.233
OTHER FOOT I THINK A LOT OF

03:24:39.300 --> 03:24:40.534
PEOPLE BE SAYING THE SAME THING.

03:24:40.601 --> 03:24:42.036
BECAUSE IT WOULD SUPPRESS

03:24:42.103 --> 03:24:45.873
DEMOCRATIC TURN OUT -- AS WELL

03:24:45.940 --> 03:24:47.041
AND SO AND AND LOOK I MEAN IF.

03:24:47.108 --> 03:24:48.676
TO YOUR POINT IF LET'S SAY JOE

03:24:48.743 --> 03:24:50.945
BIDEN DECIDES NOT TO RELEASE HIS

03:24:51.012 --> 03:24:52.113
TAX RETURNS IS NOT ON THE BALLOT

03:24:52.179 --> 03:24:52.980
IT'S GONNA BE A LOT OF PEOPLE

03:24:53.047 --> 03:24:54.482
WHO WOULD LIKE TO SHOW UP FOR

03:24:54.548 --> 03:24:56.651
JOE BIDEN.

03:24:56.717 --> 03:24:57.918
WHO WON'T -- BECAUSE THEY DON'T

03:24:57.985 --> 03:24:59.620
HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO VOTE FOR

03:24:59.687 --> 03:25:00.988
THE CANDIDATE THAT THEY SEE IS

03:25:01.055 --> 03:25:03.057
IS BEST FOR PRESIDENT SO LOOK I

03:25:03.124 --> 03:25:03.724
THINK WE SHOULD REALLY LOOK AT

03:25:03.791 --> 03:25:04.659
THIS.

03:25:04.725 --> 03:25:07.361
IN A BALANCED WAY AND AND AND

03:25:07.428 --> 03:25:09.530
VOTE NO ON THIS ON THIS PROPOSAL

03:25:09.597 --> 03:25:11.165
AND IN THE FUTURE WE CAN TALK

03:25:11.232 --> 03:25:12.266
ABOUT.

03:25:12.333 --> 03:25:13.367
YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT SHOULD BE

03:25:13.434 --> 03:25:14.468
REQUIRED TO CANDIDATES BUT I

03:25:14.535 --> 03:25:16.270
THINK IN THIS CONTEXT IT JUST

03:25:16.337 --> 03:25:17.304
REALLY LOOKS.

03:25:17.371 --> 03:25:18.673
OVERLY POLITICAL AND I THINK IT

03:25:18.739 --> 03:25:20.174
COULD HAVE A VERY NEGATIVE

03:25:20.241 --> 03:25:22.076
RESULT ON VOTER TURNOUT.

03:25:22.143 --> 03:25:24.345
IN MARCH SO THROUGH THE CHAIR

03:25:24.412 --> 03:25:25.646
PLEASE.

03:25:25.713 --> 03:25:26.480
THIS IS JUST BEING CANDID WHAT

03:25:26.547 --> 03:25:28.382
WE KNOW AND WHAT WE SEEN THIS

03:25:28.449 --> 03:25:30.184
LEGISLATURE.

03:25:30.251 --> 03:25:31.352
THE BIGGEST TURN OUT FOR

03:25:31.419 --> 03:25:33.254
DEMOCRATS.

03:25:33.320 --> 03:25:35.556
IS PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP.

03:25:35.623 --> 03:25:36.757
HE'S THE BIGGEST ORGANIZER FOR

03:25:36.824 --> 03:25:38.759
THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY.

03:25:38.826 --> 03:25:40.027
WE'RE SEEN RECORD NUMBERS OF

03:25:40.094 --> 03:25:41.128
DEMOCRATS TURNING UP BECAUSE A

03:25:41.195 --> 03:25:42.563
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP.

03:25:42.630 --> 03:25:44.098
IF THIS WAS ABOUT VOTER

03:25:44.165 --> 03:25:45.366
SUPPRESSION WE'D HAVE PRESIDENT

03:25:45.433 --> 03:25:47.735
TRUMP ON EVERY FLIPPIN BALLOT WE

03:25:47.802 --> 03:25:49.670

BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

03:25:59.547 --> 03:26:01.749
CALIFORNIA THIS IS ABOUT PUTTING

03:26:01.816 --> 03:26:02.483
THE INTERESTS OF YOUR COUNTRY

03:27:51.091 --> 03:27:52.359
THE WORLD WHO HAS AS WE HAVE

03:27:52.426 --> 03:27:54.395
SEEN HAS TREMENDOUS POTENTIAL TO

03:27:54.461 --> 03:27:55.963
DO GOOD THINGS AS WELL AS TO

03:27:56.030 --> 03:27:57.031
PROVIDE HARM.

03:27:57.097 --> 03:27:59.400
AND AND WHERE PEOPLE WANT TO

03:27:59.466 --> 03:28:00.801
VOTE FOR HIM AND NOT HIS JOB IS

03:28:00.868 --> 03:28:02.269
TO FULFILL THE QUALIFICATIONS OF

03:28:02.336 --> 03:28:04.738
ANY OFFICE THAT HE IS RUNNING

03:28:04.805 --> 03:28:05.840
FOR ALL OF US DO THAT WHEN WE

03:28:05.906 --> 03:28:07.208
RUN IN A DIFFERENT DISTRICTS.

03:28:07.274 --> 03:28:08.342
SOME OF THEM REQUIRE MORE

03:28:08.409 --> 03:28:09.743
SIGNATURES AND OTHERS SOME

03:28:09.810 --> 03:28:11.078
REQUIRE OTHER KINDS OF THINGS

03:28:11.145 --> 03:28:12.780
AND WE ALL KNOW THAT AND WE MEET

03:28:12.847 --> 03:28:14.915
THOSE QUALIFICATIONS -- I

03:28:14.982 --> 03:28:16.951
APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR LEGAL

03:28:17.017 --> 03:28:18.686
ARGUMENTS AS THERE AND ONE OF

03:28:18.752 --> 03:28:19.687
THINGS I'VE ALWAYS DONE AND

03:28:19.753 --> 03:28:21.388
MAYBE BECAUSE MY HUSBAND WAS A

03:28:21.455 --> 03:28:23.457
JUDGE AND OUT HE ALWAYS TOLD ME

03:28:23.524 --> 03:28:26.760
NEVER PRACTICED LAW WITHOUT A

03:28:26.827 --> 03:28:27.895
LICENSE.

03:28:27.962 --> 03:28:28.729
AND DOESN'T NEVER START TRYING

03:28:28.796 --> 03:28:29.296
TO MAKE LEGAL ARGUMENTS AND

03:28:29.363 --> 03:28:29.897
STATEMENTS ABOUT STUFF YOU'RE

03:28:29.964 --> 03:28:31.432
NOT QUALIFIED TO DO.

03:28:31.498 --> 03:28:33.634
SO IN THIS HOUSE I TRY TO SIMPLY

03:28:33.701 --> 03:28:35.035
DECIDE WHAT IS RIGHT WHAT IS

03:28:35.102 --> 03:28:36.971
FEAR WHAT IS JUST AND WHAT IS IN

03:28:37.037 --> 03:28:38.339
THE BEST INTEREST OF PEOPLE.

03:28:38.405 --> 03:28:39.940
WE WILL ALWAYS BE SUED BY

03:28:40.007 --> 03:28:41.141
SOMEBODY BECAUSE THAT'S JUST

03:28:41.208 --> 03:28:43.043
WHAT PEOPLE DO EVEN WITH THE

03:28:43.110 --> 03:28:44.879
BEST BILLS WE'VE EVER PASSED

03:28:44.945 --> 03:28:46.180
SOMEBODY DECIDES THEY WANT TO

03:28:46.247 --> 03:28:48.115
FOLLOW IN JUNCTION OR SOMETHING

03:28:48.182 --> 03:28:48.449
AGAINST US.

03:28:48.515 --> 03:28:49.984
AND THAT'S A PART OF IT SO I

03:28:50.050 --> 03:28:52.152
NEVER TRY TO WRITE A BILL WITH

03:28:52.219 --> 03:28:53.053
THE FEAR THAT SOMEBODY'S GONNA

03:28:53.120 --> 03:28:55.055
SUE ME -- ALWAYS FELT THAT THE

03:28:55.122 --> 03:28:56.924
PEOPLE SU THAT'S HOW MY HUSBAND

03:28:56.991 --> 03:28:57.825
MADE A LIVING SO THAT WAS A GOOD

03:28:57.892 --> 03:28:58.225
THING.

03:28:58.292 --> 03:28:59.827
AND SO IT IT HEADED TO THE

03:28:59.894 --> 03:29:02.630
INCOME OF THE FAMILY BUT SO I

03:29:02.696 --> 03:29:03.898
NEVER WORRIED ABOUT LAWSUITS WE

03:29:03.964 --> 03:29:05.432
ALWAYS WERE ABOUT WHAT'S RIGHT

03:29:05.499 --> 03:29:07.134
WHAT'S JUSTIN WAS FEAR.

03:29:07.201 --> 03:29:09.036
AND LET THOSE WHO IN THAT ARENA

03:29:09.103 --> 03:29:10.671
DECIDE WHAT'S WHERE IT FALLS IN

03:29:10.738 --> 03:29:12.106
TERMS OF THE LINES OF LAW

03:29:12.172 --> 03:29:13.507
BECAUSE YOU COULD ARGUE BOTH

03:29:13.574 --> 03:29:15.042
SIDES IT YOU'VE DONE -- SO I

03:29:15.109 --> 03:29:16.410
REALLY APPRECIATE IT I'M GOING

03:29:16.477 --> 03:29:17.278
TO SUPPORT THIS BILL BECAUSE I

03:29:17.344 --> 03:29:19.313
THINK IT IS IMPORTANT NOT JUST

03:29:19.380 --> 03:29:20.514
FOR THIS ELECTION.

03:29:20.581 --> 03:29:22.182
BUT FOR EVERY ELECTION AND WE

03:29:22.249 --> 03:29:23.617
WAIT FOR THE NEXT ELECTION

03:29:23.684 --> 03:29:24.852
WHOEVER'S PRESIDENT PEOPLE SAY

03:29:24.919 --> 03:29:26.453
THAT'S BIAS AND WE SHOULDN'T DO

03:29:26.520 --> 03:29:27.688
IT BECAUSE THAT THAT PERSON SO

03:29:27.755 --> 03:29:29.056
WE'LL NEVER HAVE A SITUATION

03:29:29.123 --> 03:29:30.658
WHERE WE DON'T HAVE A PERSON A

03:29:30.724 --> 03:29:32.092
PRESIDENT OR ANYBODY IN OFFICE.

03:29:32.159 --> 03:29:33.827
THAT SOMEBODY WILL NOT SAY YOU

03:29:33.894 --> 03:29:35.996
SHOULD NOT HAVE THIS BECAUSE

03:29:36.063 --> 03:29:36.964
YOU'VE NOW GOT A SOUL SO

03:29:37.031 --> 03:29:37.998
GOVERNOR YOU'VE GOT THIS AND

03:29:38.065 --> 03:29:38.966
THAT IS TARGETED TO THAT

03:29:39.033 --> 03:29:40.935
INDIVIDUAL MUCH MORE THAN WHAT

03:29:41.001 --> 03:29:42.236
IS FEAR WHAT IS JUST.

03:29:42.303 --> 03:29:43.771
AND IF WE HAD GOTTEN BEYOND THIS

03:29:43.837 --> 03:29:46.373
DISCUSSION I CAN ONLY IMAGINE.

03:29:46.440 --> 03:29:47.541
WHAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN LIKE TO

03:29:47.608 --> 03:29:49.243
HAVE HAD THAT INFORMATION THEN

03:29:49.310 --> 03:29:51.078
MOVE ON TO THE NEXT POINT BUT

03:29:51.145 --> 03:29:52.947
WAS STILL STUCK THE IT WITH THE

03:29:53.013 --> 03:29:54.415
WITH THE SITUATION IS THERE?

03:29:54.481 --> 03:29:55.416
AND WHAT I I DON'T DENY THE

03:29:55.482 --> 03:29:57.751
POLITICS OF IT BECAUSE OF

03:29:57.818 --> 03:29:59.219
POLITICS AS OUR IS WHAT DRIVES A

03:29:59.286 --> 03:30:00.721
LOT OF THE THINGS HERE WE SEE

03:30:00.788 --> 03:30:02.356
FLAWS IN OUR SYSTEM.

03:30:02.423 --> 03:30:04.491
WE'VE BEEN TOLD THAT WE WELL

03:30:04.558 --> 03:30:06.460
WE'VE ALWAYS GOTTEN PRESS OF THE

03:30:06.527 --> 03:30:07.728
OF TAX RETURNS THAT THERE'S NO

03:30:07.795 --> 03:30:09.229
QUOTE QUALIFICATION THAT

03:30:09.296 --> 03:30:11.231
REQUIRES IT SO IF IT'S IMPORTANT

PEOPLE YOU RIGHT LOSS TO MAKE IT

03:30:12.366 --> 03:30:13.901
REQUIRED I MEAN THAT'S THAT'S

03:30:13.968 --> 03:30:15.235
THAT'S HOW WE COME INTO.

03:30:15.302 --> 03:30:17.137
OF THE IDEA OF OF THE OF THE

03:30:17.204 --> 03:30:18.706
THINGS THAT ARE GOING ON HERE SO

03:30:18.772 --> 03:30:21.308
I APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENT I I I

03:30:21.375 --> 03:30:22.476

03:30:34.989 --> 03:30:35.255
CANDIDATE IS.

03:30:35.322 --> 03:30:35.856
FOR I HOPE YOU ALSO WANT YOUR

03:30:35.923 --> 03:30:36.490
CANDIDATE TO TURN OVER THE TAX

03:30:36.557 --> 03:30:38.559
RETURNS IT BEING PRESIDENT IS

03:30:38.625 --> 03:30:40.327
NOT A PRIVATE VISIT AND ANYONE

03:30:40.394 --> 03:30:42.296

THEY RETAIN ALL OF THEIR PRIVACY.

OFFICIAL -- BECAUSE WE HAVE ALL

03:30:47.301 --> 03:30:48.902

03:31:01.382 --> 03:31:02.716
IT IN AND YOU CAN CRY ABOUT IT

03:31:02.783 --> 03:31:04.451
AS AN ELECTED OFFICIAL IN THE

03:31:04.518 --> 03:31:05.452
ONLY SOLUTION IS DON'T RUN FOR

EVERYTHING WE DO AS ELECTED

03:31:23.670 --> 03:31:25.406
OFFICIALS -- WE HOPE IN THE END

03:31:25.472 --> 03:31:26.673
THAT PEOPLE APPRECIATE WHAT

03:31:26.740 --> 03:31:28.409
