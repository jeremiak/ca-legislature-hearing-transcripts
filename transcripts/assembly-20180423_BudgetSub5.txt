INTERESTING REQUEST VERY GOOD REQUEST AND SOME OF THEM OVERLAP EACH OTHER SO I I'M THINKING OF WAYS IN WHICH THEY CAN PROBABLY BE BUNDLED IN SOME WAY OF THAT. EITHER SOMETHING THAT WERE ALREADY FUNDING AND CAN ADD TO THAT OR. MAYBE IT AGENCY THAT SOMEONE IS IDENTIFIED REALLY HANDLES ALL THOSE THINGS OF SOME OF THE REQUESTS ARE OVERLAPPING. BUT THAT'S UNDERSTANDABLE BECAUSE OF SOME OF THE CONCERNS OF CONCERN THAT WE ALL HAVE SOARED ON BEGIN WITH YOU MISTER ARAMBULA. IF YOU'LL GIVE US SO. FIVE MINUTES OF YOUR TIME TO TELL US WHAT YOUR PROPOSALS ARE. THANK YOU DOCTOR WEBER AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE. I'D LIKE TO THANK THE CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT MY REQUEST FOR FUNDING FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE'S. TAX RECOVERY AND CRIMINAL ENFORCEMENT TASK FORCE ALSO KNOWN AS TRACE. THE REQUEST FOR FUNDING IS IN CONJUNCTION WITH SENATE BILL TWELVE SEVENTY TWO. AUTHORED BY SENATOR GALGIANI PRO TEM ATKINS AND MYSELF. WHICH HAS ENJOYED BIPARTISAN SUPPORT. ACCORDING TO THE UCLA LABOR CENTER REPORT THE STATE UNDERGROUND ECONOMY COULD BE AS LARGE AS A HUNDRED AND FORTY BILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY. IT IS THEREFORE ESTIMATED THAT THE STATE'S LOSES EIGHT POINT FIVE BILLION IN CORPORATE PERSONAL AND SALES TAX EACH YEAR AN AMOUNT THAT IS ROUGHLY EQUIVALENT TO THE STATE'S RAINY DAY FUND. BASED ON THESE NUMBERS THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT UNCOLLECTED REVENUES THAT ARE DESPERATELY NEEDED TO FUND BASIC GOVERNMENT SERVICES. THE UNDERGROUND ECONOMY MORE THAN DOUBLED BETWEEN NINETEEN SEVENTY IN TWO THOUSAND. MAKING EXPANSIONS OF PROGRAMS TASK WITH THE REIGNING IN THEN MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER. A TRACE TASK FORCE HAS BEEN OPERATING AS A PILOT PROGRAM WITH TEAMS LOCATED IN SACRAMENTO AND LOS ANGELES AND HAS RECOVERED MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN LOST TAX REVENUE. FOR THE STATE. THIS BUDGET REQUEST WILL EXPAND TRACED TO THREE MORE LOCATIONS INCLUDING SAN DIEGO FRESNO AND IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN THE LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION PUBLISHER REPORT ON THE UNDERGROUND ECONOMY THAT RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE TASK FORCE AND RECOMMENDED THE PROGRAM'S EXPANSION TO EVERY METROPOLITAN REGION. AS A RESULT I AM HERE TODAY. TO REQUEST THAT THE ASSEMBLY SUBCOMMITTEE CONSIDER ALLOCATING THE TRACE TASK FORCE ELEVEN POINT EIGHT SIX THREE MILLION DOLLARS. TO BOLSTER THEIR EFFORTS IN DISRUPTING THE UNDERGROUND ECONOMY. SO FAR THE TASK FORCE HAS IDENTIFIED TWO HUNDRED AND TEN MILLION IN UNREPORTED GROSS RECEIPTS AND FORTY SIX MILLION AND ASSOCIATED TAX LOSSES TO THE STATE. ALMOST ANOTHER THIRTY MINUTES TO DATE THE TASK FORCE HAS RECOVERED OVER TEN MILLION DOLLARS WITH ALMOST ANOTHER THIRTY MILLION IN ANTICIPATED BILLINGS AND RESTITUTION FOR TAX LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH ONGOING CASES. IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT NEITHER TEAM HAS BEEN COMPLETELY STAFFED WITH FULL TIME PERSONNEL. FULL TIME DEDICATED STAFFING AND AN INCREASE IN DOJ AGENTS WILL UNDOUBTEDLY IMPROVE RESULTS. GIVEN THE PERSISTENT AND SIGNIFICANT EFFORTS EXCUSE ME AFFECTS OF THE UNDERGROUND ECONOMY. FROM LABOR LAW VIOLATIONS TO UNFAIR COMPETITION TO LOST TAX REVENUE. WE NEED BETTER ENFORCEMENT. THEREFORE I AM REQUESTING THE COMMITTEE APPROVE INCREASE FUNDING FOR THIS PROGRAM. THE TRACE TASK FORCE IS DESIGNED TO PROTECT HONEST HARDWORKING BUSINESSES AND WORKERS. INSURERS CONSUMER PROTECTIONS AND ENJOYS A BROAD COALITION OF SUPPORT INCLUDING BOTH LABOR AND BUSINESS. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR YOUR ATTENTION AND CONSIDERATION ON THIS BUDGET REQUEST IN HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT IS MARIO DE BERNARDO FROM THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE.

I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST CONSIDERATION OF A GENERAL FUND BUDGET APPROPRIATION IN THE AMOUNT OF TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS. FOR A COMPETITIVE GRANT PROGRAM TO BE ADMINISTERED BY THE BOARD OF STATE AND COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS. THE TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS WILL BE USED FOR CAPITAL OUTLAY FUNDING FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OR RENOVATION OF LOCAL POLICE DEPARTMENT FACILITIES. AND SMALL UNDERSERVED RURAL COMMUNITIES. MANY OF THE EXISTING POLICE FACILITIES IN SMALL RURAL COMMUNITIES AND CITIES DO NOT HAVE ADEQUATE SPACE FOR PERSONNEL AND EQUIPMENT. THEY DO NOT HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE OR SPACE TO ADEQUATELY SUPPORT THE TO ME ENTITIES IN WHICH THEY SERVE. MANY LACK THE SPACE NECESSARY TO PROVIDE THE TRAINING TO STORE EVIDENCE TO CONDUCT BOOKINGS AND OTHER SPACE IS REQUIRED BY THE PEACE OFFICER STANDARDS AND TRAINING. MANY WERE BUILT BEFORE NINETEEN SEVENTY AND FACE SERIOUS SAFETY CONCERNS. THESE SUBSTANDARD POLICE STATIONS ALSO DO NOT HAVE PRIVATE INTERVIEW ROOMS OR SPACE TOGETHER WITNESS REPORTS. PUBLIC SAFETY AGENCIES AND RURAL COMMUNITIES UTILIZE EVERY AVAILABLE TOOL AND RESOURCE TO DELIVER QUALITY PUBLIC SAFETY. BUT THEY NEED TO MAKE IMPROVEMENTS TO THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE SO THAT THEY CAN PERFORM THEIR JOBS SAFELY AND EFFICIENTLY. IN RECOGNITION OF THE DESPERATE NEED OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE FUNDING A TOTAL OF EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS WAS ALLOCATED FOR PUBLIC SAFETY FACILITIES AND TWENTY FIFTEEN AND TWENTY SIXTEEN. A TWENTY SIXTEEN TWENTY SEVENTEEN BUDGET INCLUDED JUST OVER TEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE CONSTRUCTION AND RENOVATION OF POLICE DEPARTMENT FACILITIES. LAST YEAR THIS BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE. HEARD AND RECEIVED REQUEST FOR FUNDING IN EXCESS OF THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. THIS PROPOSAL WILL ESTABLISH A NEW COMPETITIVE GRANT PROGRAM. TO BE ADMINISTERED BY THE B. S. CC. TO BE ELIGIBLE ELIGIBLE CITIES MUST HAVE A POPULATION LESS THAN THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND. THIRTY THOUSAND IN ADDITION AT LEAST TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE CITY CENSUS TRACKS. MUST BE EITHER HAVE A MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD. INCOME AT OR BELOW EIGHTY PERCENT OF THE STATEWIDE MEDIAN INCOME OR ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED BY ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION AS DETERMINED BY THE CAL IN VIRAL SCREEN. THIS PROGRAM WILL ESTABLISH A COMPETITIVE GRANT PROGRAM THAT WILL ALLOW THE BE SEC TO ASSESS A CITIES NEED AND AWARD MONEY TO THE LOCALITIES. THAT NEED IT THE MOST. CALIFORNIA'S RURAL COMMUNITIES FACE SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES MAINTAINING THE PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE. IF APPROVED TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS WILL HELP SOME OF OUR COMMUNITIES MAKE DESPERATELY NEEDED IMPROVEMENTS TO THEIR PUBLIC SAFETY FACILITIES.

FOR THOSE WHO ABSENT SECOND PERSON WHO WANTS TO MAKE A PRESENTATION CONCERNING THEIR OF. QUEST DOT THE WOULD. MAKE A STATEMENT. ALL CONCERNING LAW LIBRARIES YES. MR WOULD. THINK ABOUT SHARON MEMBERS. I'M HERE TODAY TO SUPPORT A ONE TIME SIXTEEN POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING ALLOCATION FOR COUNTY LAW LIBRARIES. COUNTY LAW LIBRARIES ARE VALUABLE RESOURCE ESPECIALLY THE PEOPLE WHO DO NOT HAVE THE RESOURCES TO AFFORD LEGAL ASSISTANCE. BUT COUNTY LAW LIBRARIES ARE NOT COUNTY AGENCIES THERE ARE NOT FUNDED BY COUNTY GOVERNMENTS THEY RECEIVE NO GENERALISED BESSEL FUND APPROPRIATIONS FROM THE STATE. MORE THAN NINETY PERCENT OF COUNTY LAW LIBRARY FUND FUNDING COMES FROM A SMALL PORTION OF THE CIVIL FILING FEES FROM TWO DOLLARS. THE FIFTY DOLLARS PER CASE DEPENDING ON THE COUNTY AND THE TYPE OF THE CASE. THE CIVIL FILING FEE REVENUE THAT COUNTY LAW EVERITT LIBRARIES DEPEND UPON HAS DROPPED FORTY PERCENT SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND NINE TO TWO A DECREASE IN THE NUMBER CASE VIOLENCE. COMBINED WITH AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF FEE WAIVERS GRANTED AND NEW EXEMPTIONS ADOPTED INTO LAW. THIS ONE TIME ALLOCATION WOULD ASSURE THAT COUNTY LAW LIBRARIES CAN REMAIN OPEN PROVIDING THE TIME TO DETERMINE IN A POP UP ON GOING FUTURE STABLE FUNDING. COUNTY LAW LIBRARY TO HELP ASSIST DISTRESS PARENTS FIGHTING FOR CUSTODY OF THEIR CHILDREN ADULT CHILDREN TIME TO NAVIGATE THE CONSERVATORSHIP PROCESS. TO CARE FOR THEIR ELDERLY PARENTS ENTREPRENEURS TRYING TO START NEW BUSINESSES IMMIGRANTS STRUGGLING WITH COMPLEX APPLICATION FORMS. PEOPLE TERRIFIED BY THREATS FROM UNSCRUPULOUS BILL COLLECTORS TENANTS LIVING IN DEPLORABLE CONDITIONS IT'S SO MUCH MORE. IT MY DISTRICT AFTER THE RECENT WILDFIRES THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE LOST THEIR HOMES AND BUSINESSES AND EMPLOYMENT. THE LAW LIBRARIES HAVE PROVIDED VALUABLE ASSISTANCE TO PEOPLE WHO WERE WORKING THROUGH COMPLICATED PAPERWORK. VARIOUS BUREAUCRACIES THAT TRY TO REBUILD THEIR LIVES. THE CALIFORNIA JUDICIAL COUNCIL REPORTS AT SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF CIVIL CASES NASH CASES NATIONALLY AND MORE THAN EIGHTY PERCENT OF FAMILY LAW MATTERS IN CALIFORNIA. BOB AT LEAST ONE SELF REPRESENTED SELF REPRESENTED LATE LITIGANT. THE COST OF HIRING A PRIVATE ATTORNEY IS SIMPLY PROHIBITED FOR THE MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIANS. LEGAL AID PRO BONO ORGANIZATIONS AND COURT BASED SELF HELP CENTERS DO WONDERFUL WORK. BUT THEY CAN ONLY ADDRESS A SMALL PORTION OF THE NEED. THE COURTS ARE CLOGGED WITH UNPREPARED SUFFER REPRESENTED LITIGANTS WHO WITHOUT SUPPORT EDUCATION OFTEN DELAYED PROCEEDINGS WASTE THE COURT'S TIME FRUSTRATE COURT OFFICERS IN ADD SIGNIFICANTLY TO THE COSTS OF MEN OF ADMINISTERING JUSTICE. LAW LIBRARIES CAN HELP PEOPLE COME TO COURT PREPARE FOR THE FIRST TIME. THE FACTS YOU NEED THE FIRST TIME. AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST IN THESE CASES JUSTICE IS NOT WELL SERVED. JUST A JUDGES AND ATTORNEYS. TELLS AT THE ABILITY OF COURSE TO DELIVER JUSTICE IS COMPLETELY UNDERMINED WHEN LITIGANTS DO NOT KNOW HOW TO FOLLOW PROCEDURE PRESENT A CASE SUBMIT EVIDENCE. IT'S NOT A PARTISAN ISSUE MY MY WERE MY REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES DEVON MATHIS HAS ALSO SUBMITTED A LETTER REQUESTING THIS FUNDING. AND ALL AND ALTHOUGH HE COULD NOT BE HERE TODAY YES I LET YOU KNOW OF HIS SUPPORT. THANK YOU. IT COMES FROM MEMBERS. QUICK QUESTION IF DO YOU YOU'VE GOT. IN ALLOCATION HERE IS A REQUEST AS A ONE TIME REQUEST CRACKED WHAT HAPPENS AFTER THE ONE TIME WHICH TOOK THE THE LAW THAT LAW LABOR SILICON FOR CAN. THE TIME TO BE ABLE TO COME UP WITH OF A LONG TERM FUNDING SOURCE AND THAT IS LOOKING FOR A SOLUTION EXACT IS IT JUST A STOP GAP MEASURES ACT WITH THE LAW. WHICH LAW LIBRARIES ARE WE TALKING ABOUT THE DO YOU. I'M NOT SURE A YES WHICH GAUGE COUNTY AT THIS COUNTY HAS A LIBRARY BUT I MEAN I WAS HE SOME MUST BE IN MORE NEED THAN OTHERS PROBABLY THEY ARE AND. YOU KNOW HOW THIS IS ALLOCATED ONE HOME AT THIS POINT I'M AS I'M I'M NOT I'M NOT SURE ABBY CAN BITE US WITH YOU. BUT THIS. AT I THINK THIS IS OF INTEREST REQUEST IN WRITING DID IT VARIES BASED ON POPULATION I KNOW MY OWN COUNTY LOPPED LIBRARY AS A CINEMA COUNTY AND SAW THE RESOURCES YOU KNOW PLUMMET AND DOUG. AND THE SERVICE NEED RISE SO. IT'S A IT'S A IT'S A BRIDGE TO. HOPEFULLY. ALL OF THE TIME WE ACTUALLY HAVE MORE FUNDING. THE ONE I KNOW I KNOW WE HAVE. WE JUST FUNDED WELL WE'RE LOOKING AT FUNDING IN THE COURTS OF THESE. FOLKS WHO HELP PEOPLE FOR THAT. IS THE SELF HELP CENTERS. OF HOW DOES THIS DO YOU KNOW IF THIS IN A PHASES AT ALL WITH THE SELF HELP LET CENTERS THAT I DON'T KNOW OKAY. ALRIGHT. OKAY TO RE INTERESTING TO KNOW OKAY BUT DON'T GET THAT INFORMATION FOR A MANAGER AYE. OKAY SO WE GET TO SEE IT IT WOULD NOT THIS IS A PART OF THAT OKAY. DO HAVE ANY UP PUBLIC COMMENTS ON THIS YES MADAM CHAIR MICHAEL COR BET ONE. REPRESENTING THE COUNCIL CALIFORNIA COUNTY LAW LIBRARIANS IN ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION THERE IS AN INTERFACE BETWEEN COUNTY LAW LIBRARIES AND. SELF HELP CENTERS IN SOME OF THE COUNTIES NOT ALL OF THE COUNTIES. BUT I WANT TO POINT OUT TO COUNTY LAW LIBRARIES IN CALIFORNIA HAVE BEEN AROUND FOR A HUNDRED AND TWENTY SEVEN YEARS. SERVE ROUGHLY A HALF A MILLION PEOPLE PER YEAR. AND IT WASN'T UNTIL TWO THOUSAND EIGHT THAT THE PROBLEM AROSE WITH A UNIFORM CIVIL FILING FEE WENT INTO EFFECT. IT TOOK AWAY THE ABILITY OF COUNTY SUPERVISORS TO RAISE THAT PORTION OF THE CIVIL FILING FEES THAT WENT TO COUNTY LAW LIBRARIES SO THERE HAVE BEEN FOR INCREASES IN THE CIVIL FILING FEE SINCE THAT LAW WENT INTO EFFECT. BUT NONE OF THOSE FUNDS WERE ALLOCATED TO COUNTY LAW LIBRARIES THEY ALL WENT TO THE COURTS TO HELP BACK FILL FOR GENERAL FUND CUTS. I IS THERE ANY. NOT TRUTH IS ANY VALUE IN CONVERSATION WITH REGARDS TO TECHNOLOGY IN TERMS OF IS THAT. BUT YOU FIND MORE MORE FOLKS USING TECHNOLOGY IN ACCESSING THINGS IN THAT METHOD RATHER THAN ACTUALLY PHYSICALLY GOING TO LIVE WHERE WE. COUNTY LAW LIBRARIES SERVICE BOTH OF THOSE NEEDS THE PROBLEM IS IS THAT TECHNOLOGY ALONE WON'T HELP THEM. OF FILL OUT THE NECESSARY PAPERS BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT GOODLY NUMBER OF SELF REPRESENTED LITIGANTS GO TO COURT IN THE PAPERWORK IS A FLAWED. AND TO THE EXTENT THAT THE PAPERWORK IS FLAWED THAT PARTICULAR CASES PUT OVER THE COURTS WASTED TIME THAT DAY ON THAT CASE. AND THAT. STALLS THE WHOLE PROCESS OF OF OF COURT OPERATIONS. ISN'T IS VITALLY IMPORTANT THAT COUNTY LAW LIBRARIES BE FUNDED WE HAVE SOME LAW LIBRARIES THAT ARE ON THE PRECIPICE OF ACTUALLY CLOSING. THIS FORTY PERCENT AGGREGATE CUT THAT HAS OCCURRED ACROSS THE STATE HAS IMPACTED DIFFERENT LIBRARIES IN DIFFERENT WAYS IN TERMS OF THE. LEVEL OF LOS FUNDING BUT ALL OF THEM HAVE LOST FUNDING. YOU VERY MUCH. SLASH BUT YEAH. WHERE? HOW DO WE ARRIVE AT THE FIGURE SIXTEEN POINT FIVE MILLION? SIXTEEN POINT FIVE MILLION IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT COUNTY LAW LIBRARIES WRIST RECEIVING WHEN THE UNIFORM CIVIL FILING FEE WENT INTO EFFECT AND THE LATEST YEAR FOR WHICH WE HAVE NUMBERS WHICH IS TO. FISCAL YEAR TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN. OKAY SO WHAT WOULD THERE BE SOME KIND OF PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION YES THE DISTRIBUTION WOULD BE THE SIXTEEN POINT FIVE COVERS EVERY LIE EVERY LIBRARY. BACK TO THE POINT OF WHAT THEY RECEIVING IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT. IQ LIKE YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU FOR THE RECOMMENDATION POLITICAL POST. OKAY THAT BRINGS US TO. A OVER MISTER OBERNOLTE YES THE JUDGESHIPS. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR OF. REQUEST FOR SIXTEEN MILLION DOLLARS TO FUND TEN ADDITIONAL JUDGESHIPS IN CALIFORNIA THIS WOULD BE A VERY MODEST DOWN PAYMENT ON THE CRITICAL LACK. OF JUDGESHIPS IN THE STATE IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL DID A STUDY IN WHICH IT IDENTIFIED THAT WE ARE A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY JUDGES SHORT. OF MEETING OF JUDICIAL WORKLOAD HERE IN CALIFORNIA. IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED. THE GUY CREATION OF FIFTY ADDITIONAL JUDGESHIPS BUT UNFORTUNATELY BECAUSE OF THE RECESSION AT THAT TIME NONE OF THOSE POSITIONS WERE FUNDED AND SINCE THEN THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER. OF ATTEMPTS TO FUND ADDITIONAL JUDGESHIPS IN CALIFORNIA ALL OF WHICH HAVE FAILED. THE AND I WANT TO SHARE SOMETHING FROM MY OWN PERSONAL EXPERIENCE THAT MAKES IS A VERY POIGNANT ISSUE FOR ME BEFORE SERVING IN THIS LEGISLATURE I WAS THE MAYOR OF THE CITY OF BIG BEAR LAKE AND WHILE I WAS MAYOR. WE HAD OUR COURTHOUSE IN BIG BEAR CLOSED AND SO I GOT TO SEE FIRSTHAND THE EFFECTS ON A COMMUNITY WHEN DICK YOUR CONSTITUENTS IN YOUR RESIDENTS LOSE ACCESS TO JUSTICE. AND IT GAVE ME AN INCREDIBLY POIGNANT APPRECIATION FOR THE FACT THAT THE FUNDAMENTAL. RESPONSIBILITY OF GOVERNMENT IS TO PROVIDE THAT ACCESS FOR JUSTICE. BUT WHEN I WAS ELECTED TO THIS POSITION I CAME TO REALIZE THAT WHEN OUR COURTHOUSE WAS CLOSED ON THAT DAY WASN'T JUST OUR COURTHOUSE BUT THERE WERE FIVE COURT HOUSES MY DISTRICT THAT WERE CLOSE THAT SAME DAY. AND NOW I CAN TELL YOU THAT EVEN OUR COURTHOUSE IN BIG BEAR IS NOT THE MOST DIRE. PRESENTATION OF THE PROBLEM WE LOST ALSO THE COURTHOUSE IN NEEDLES AND MY CONSTITUENTS NEEDLES WHEN THEY NEED TO HAVE SOMETHING EDUCATED ARE NOW DRIVING THREE AND A HALF HOURS. TO GET TO THE NEAREST COURTHOUSE. AND. YOU COULD IMAGINE THAT WHEN YOU HAVE THAT KIND OF REQUIREMENT TO GET ACCESS TO JUSTICE. THAT THE PEOPLE THAT LOSE ACCESS TO JUSTICE ARE THE PEOPLE THAT ARE THE MOST DISADVANTAGED. MEMBERS OF SOCIETY THAT THE PEOPLE WHO CAN'T AFFORD TO TAKE THE WHOLE DAY OFF OF WORK OR CAN'T AFFORD SEVEN HOURS OF FUEL FOR THEIR VEHICLE TO BE ABLE TO GET TO COURT. SO I IT'S REALLY GIVEN ME AN APPRECIATION FOR THIS NEED. THE ABOUT THE WERE ASKING FOR SIXTEEN MILLION DOLLARS IS JUST A VERY SMALL DOWN PAYMENT ON SOLVING THAT PROBLEM. SO WITH ME TO OF FURTHER TESTIFY ON HOW DIRE THE SITUATION IS BECOME HIS JUDGE VANDERVEER HE IS THE PRESIDING JUDGE OF THE. US AMADOR COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY. JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT NEEDLES IF YOU LIVE THERE AND YOU DON'T HAVE A CAR. TWO FRIDAYS A MONTH YOU CAN GET ON A BUS AT SIX FIFTEEN IN THE MORNING AND IF YOU'RE CASES IN BARSTOW ITS TRAFFIC. GET DROPPED THEIR IN THEM OFF THERE IN THE MORNING. IF YOUR CASE IS A MISDEMEANOR YOU GO TO VICTORVILLE. AND YOU GET HOME AT SEVEN FIFTEEN PM SO IT'S A THIRTEEN HOUR DAYS FOR BECAUSE YOU MISSED YOUR CLASSES DO I CLASS AND YOU GOT IT REINSTATED ON PROBATION. OUR QUOTAS RECOGNIZE THAT WE'VE MADE SOME CHANGES WERE YOU DOING VIZIO REMOTE AT THE TIME BUT IT STILL THERE'S TO STILL THE STAFFING OF THOSE PROGRAMS. THE CURRENT CASELOAD AVERAGE CASELOAD FOR JUDGE ARE COUNTY HAVING HANDLING CRIMINALS SIX HUNDRED FIFTY PLUS AVERAGE ACTIVE CASELOAD. IN JUVENILE DEPENDENCY WE HAVE A FIFTY TO PIT PERCENT INCREASE IN FILINGS FROM FISCAL YEAR TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE. WAIT TIMES IN FAMILY LAW MAY EXCEED TWO MONTHS TO GET ON THE COUNTER UNLESS IT'S AN EMERGENCY HEARING. AND WHEN WE TALK ABOUT TIME A COLLABORATIVE COURTS ARE DRUG COURTS A VETERANS COURTS ARE HOMELESS COURTS A MENTAL HEALTH COURT CERTAIN OTHER CLUB IF COURTS. THOSE ARE TIME INTENSIVE COURTS YOU NEED TO INTERACT AS A JUDGE WITH THOSE APPEARING FRONT OF YOU JUST CAN'T PUSH THE CASE THROUGH AND CALL THE NEXT ONE YOU NEED TO TAKES TIME WITH THOSE PEOPLE. SO THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET IS GREAT FOR THE JUDICIARY WE ARE. PORT ABOVE IT GIVES US THE RESOURCES WE NEED TO DO A LOT. BUT WHAT IT GIVES US IS MONEY WE CAN USE WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS GIVE US TIME. THIS IS REALLY ABOUT TIME TIME TO THE LITIGANTS WHO DRIVE THREE HOURS FIVE HOURS TO COURT THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE HEARD BECAUSE THERE'S ENOUGH. JUDGES THERE TO HEAR ALL THE CASES THAT ARE COUNTER THAT DAY. TIME TO BE PRESENT THEIR CASE. NOT FILLING THERE'S A ROOM FULL OF PEOPLE. I'VE KNOWN THE PAST RIGHT DONE THIS TO MEET ARRAIGNMENTS I'VE HAD TWO HUNDRED CASES ON IN VICTORVILLE IN THE MORNING. AND PEOPLE LOOK AROUND WHAT AND HOW MUCH TIME I GOING TO GET YOU GIVE THEM AS MUCH AS YOU CAN BUT YOU HAVE TO GET THROUGH THE DAY. SO WE ARE SUPPORT. SUPPORT OF THIS BILL IT GIVES IT THAT LITIGANTS TIME BECAUSE THE COURTS TIME AND IT IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY. TO UNFULFILLED NEED IN THE CALIFORNIA COURT SYSTEM THANK YOU THANK YOU. UP ANY ONE IN THE AUDIENCE. ONE IS JUST. LET US KNOW THAT YOU'RE SUPPORTIVE OF IT JUST YOUR NAME AND YOUR AGENCY HOME CERTAINLY MADAM CHAIR I'M ELIZABETH ESPINOSA HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS IN THE COUNTY OF RIVERSIDE. A WHERE THE NEED OF FOR JUDGESHIPS IS ALSO WELL DOCUMENTED AND QUITE CRITICAL THANK YOU THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE. OKAY. WE WILL LOOK INTO THIS WEEK WHEN I YOU MAY KNOW WHAT WE ARE. I THINK OUR PROPOSAL IS TO WHAT SEVENTY FIVE MILLION. FOR DISCRETION TO THE COURTS TO USE AS THEY SEE FIT HOPEFULLY TO REDUCE THE WAIT TIME AND. AN ADDITIONAL POSITIONS. AND WE HAVEN'T WE HAVEN'T PUT NECESSARY OURSELVES IN A LIMIT ON WHAT THAT MONEY COULD BE USED FOR NO WE HAVE PUT IN SOME LANGUAGES TRYING TO LOOK BECAUSE LANGUAGE THAT WOULD BASICALLY SAY IT SHOULD BE DESIGNED TO REDUCE THE. THE WORKLOAD WHICH WHICH WOULD MAKE INVOLVE JUDGES MAY INVOLVE CLERKS MAYBE IT WAS SO FAR DOWN IN SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS. IN TERMS OF THAT BUT I THINK THERE'S AN ADDITIONAL SEVEN FIVE MILLION. FOR DISCRETION. AND WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHETHER THAT DISCRETION SHOULD BE TARGETED TOWARD. JUDGESHIPS OR SOME OTHERS I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAD A CHANCE TO TALK WITH YOU. WORK THERE THOUGH THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL WITH REGARDS TO THE SEVENTY FIVE MILLION. AND WHAT WOULD BE INCLUDED WHAT WOULD BE ALLOCATED OF THE SEVEN FIVE MILLION THAT WE'RE GOING TO GIVE. THAT'S BEEN DECIDED AT THIS TIME MOCHA THAT BUT THAT. I THINK THERE IS A DIFFERENCE WHEN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET BUDGET AND THIS BILL AT BECAUSE WE'RE LOOKING AT USING THAT MONEY TO INVEST LIKE VIDEO EQUIPMENT. AND NEEDLES WE HAVE A VIDEO REMOTE SO THAT MEASURE BAR SO PEOPLE HAVE TO COME NOW BIO. THAT TAKES TIME AND MONEY TO GET BY THAT EQUIPMENT SET UP TO RUN THE COURTHOUSE SO THAT IS SEPARATE AND AND ARGUE. FROM THIS BILL OVER WE NEED THE JUDGES ARE HOME JUDGESHIPS JUDICIAL OFFICERS. AND THIS IS THE WAY TO GET THEM THERE OKAY. THIS THIS REQUEST OF THE FUNDING WOULD GO TO THE. JUDICIAL COUNCIL ON THE WOULD ALLOCATED BASED ON NEEDS IT IS WHAT IS THAT THE REQUEST THAT IT THERE'S A THAT WOULD FUND TEN OF THE HUNDRED EIGHTY POSITIONS I SAY THEY NEED. A TEN OF THE FIFTY ADDITIONAL JUDGES THAT WERE AUTHORIZED WAY BACK. ELEVEN YEARS AGO TWO THOUSAND SEVEN AND THEY WOULD ALLOCATE THOSE JUDGES ACCORDING TO A METHODOLOGY CALLED THE WORKLOAD ALLOCATION FORMULA SO THEY WOULD GO TO. WHATEVER COURT SYSTEMS HAD THE HIGHEST JUDICIAL NEED. ALRIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE SHOULD. AND THAT BRINGS US TO BAKER. A I DON'T KNOW IF SHE'S HERE. SHE'S ON HER WAY THEN THAT'S CABALLERO WHO'S NEXT. THE BIGGER ISSUES HERE HOW. HELLO I ASSUME YOU KNOW THAT THERE TO REQUEST FOR THIS YES OKAY SOUNDS GOOD. HOME WE WERE GONNA DO IT TOGETHER BUT I THINK THAT TIME CONSTRAINTS WORK SO THAT. WE'RE DOING IT SEPARATELY ALRIGHT NO PROBLEM. MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS AND PLEASED TO PRESENT THIS VERY IMPORTANT BUDGET REQUEST TO INVEST IN ONE OF THE STATE'S MOST VITAL. LOCAL PROGRAMS IT REDUCES CRIME AND VIOLENCE AND. WAS GONNA. THINK THANK ASSEMBLYMAN JONES SAWYER FOR HIS WORK ON THIS LAST YEAR BUT HE'S GONE. SO I'LL MOVE ON THE CALIFORNIA VIOLENCE INTERVENTION AND PREVENTION GRAT GRANT PROGRAM COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS CAL BE IP IS CALIFORNIA'S ONLY DEDICATED SOURCE OF STATE SUPPORT FOR LOCALLY DRIVEN VIOLENCE PREVENTION INITIATIVES. SINCE TWO THOUSAND SEVEN THIS LEGISLATURE HAS APPROPRIATED APPROXIMATELY NINE POINT TWO MILLION ANNUALLY TO HELP CITIES ACROSS THE STATE TO IMPLEMENT LIFESAVING CAUSTIC HAS AFFECTED STRATEGIES TO REDUCE VIOLENCE. THIS GRANT PROGRAM HAS PROVEN TO BE EFFECTIVE. IN LOCAL COMMUNITIES WITH THE HELP OF CAL GRANT FUNDING THEIR PREDECESSOR DEKALB VIP. THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES HAS WITNESSED A THIRTY EIGHT PERCENT REDUCTION IN HOMICIDES AND A FORTY SIX PERCENT REDUCTION IN AGGREGATE AGGRAVATED ASSAULTS. THE CITY OF OAKLAND HAS SEEN A FORTY THREE PERCENT DROP IN HOMICIDES AND A FORTY NINE PERCENT REDUCTION IN NON FATAL INJURY SHOOTINGS SENSE IT'S PROGRAM INCEPTION IN TWENTY. TWELVE. LAST YEAR OAKLAND EXPERIENCED ITS LOWEST NUMBER OF HOMICIDES IN TWENTY YEARS. THE CITY OF SEASIDE WHICH WAS AWARDED ONE POINT THREE MILLION OVER A THREE YEAR PERIOD HAS ALL ALSO EXPERIENCED A DRAMATIC DROP IN HOMICIDES AND SHOOTINGS. THE FUNDS PROVIDED TO THE CITY OF SALINAS WHICH IS IN MY DISTRICT HOPE TO IMPLY COMMUNITY POLICE AND TWO OF SIT THE CITY'S. MOST TROUBLED NEIGHBORHOODS AND. AND AND TO EXPAND ITS SATURDAY NIGHT RECREATIONAL PROGRAM FOR TEENS AS A DIRECT RESULT OF THESE EFFORTS THERE'S BEEN A DRAMATIC DECLINING GANG AND YOUTH VIOLENCE. TODAY I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THAT THE SUBCOMMITTEE CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING. REAUTHORIZE KALBE IP PROGRAM AND APPROPRIATE EIGHTEEN POINT FIVE MILLION TO SUPPORT THE PROGRAM. THIS AMOUNT WOULD DOUBLE THE FUNDING LEVEL FOR THE CURRENT YEAR AND ALLOW MORE COMMUNITIES TO PARTICIPATE. THIS YEAR THE BOARD OF STATE AND COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS RECEIVED APPLICATIONS FROM OVER A HUNDRED AND TWENTY CITIES AND COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS BUT THE SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN APPROPRIATION WILL FIND ONLY TWENTY OF THOSE LOCAL PROGRAMS. THIS REQUEST WOULD ALLOW THE BOARD. TO AWARD MULTI YEAR GRANTS TO AT LEAST TWENTY MORE CITIES AND COMMUNITY SERVICE PROVIDERS ARE TO MAKE SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENTS IN A NUMBER OF HIGH NEED LOCALITIES. SECONDLY IT WOULD ENSURE A STABLE SOURCE OF FUNDING FOR THE PROGRAM BY CONTINUOUSLY APPROPRIATING FUNDS THROUGH THE BUDGET ACT. THIS WOULD NOT ONLY HOPE TO SUSTAIN SUCCESSFUL PROGRAMS THAT ARE EFFECTIVELY REDUCING VIOLENCE IN OUR COMMUNITIES BUT PROVIDE GREATER PREDICTABILITY FOR LOCAL PLANNING PURPOSES. AND THIRDLY. UP THIS BUT ADOPTING BUDGET TRAILER LANGUAGE TO GIVE PREFERENCE TO APPLICANTS APPLICANTS. THAT INCORPORATE A REGIONAL APPROACH TO REDUCING VIOLENCE THERE THEREBY INCENTIVIZING MULTIPLE CITIES AND COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS TO JOINTLY APART APPLY FOR PROGRAM FUNDING IN MY REGION THEIR NUMBER A VERY SMALL COMMUNITIES THAT. ARE ARE ALL IN RURAL AREAS THAT. HAVE THE ABILITY TO COORDINATE AND TO WORK TOGETHER TO BE ABLE TO REDUCE VIOLENCE IN THIS WOULD PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM TO. SCORE I BELIEVE UP HIGHER AND FINALLY PROVIDE THAT TEN PERCENT OF AVAILABLE GRANT FUNDING BE AWARDED TO APPLICANTS. FROM COMMUNITIES THAT ARE AFFECTED BY GANG VIOLENCE AND HAVE A STATE CORRECTIONAL FACILITY LOCATED IN THEIR COUNTY. ACCORDING TO THE DISEASE CENTERS FOR DISEASE. AND CONTROL CALIFORNIA GUN RELATED HOMICIDE IS THAT BY EIGHTEEN PERCENT REVERSING YEARS OF DECLINE. THE COST OF INNOVATIVE EFFECTIVE EFFECTIVE VIOLENCE INTERVENTION PROGRAM TO SMALL WHEN COMPARED TO THE ENORMOUS COST ASSOCIATED WITH THAT VIOLENCE IN OUR STATE. AND FRANKLY. WE'VE BEEN FOCUSING ON UP LOOKING AT WAYS TO BE ABLE TO REDUCE OUR PRISON POPULATION BY ALSO INVESTING IN PREVENTION IT'S IT'S IT'S A WISE. COMMUNITY BASED PREVENTION STRATEGIES ON ARE REALLY CENTRAL TO REALLY MAKING A DIFFERENCE AND SO WITH ME HERE TODAY. AT SPEAK BRIEFLY IT'S PART OF THE BUDGET REQUEST IS MIKE MICHAEL I BELIEVE FROM THE CUT GIFFORD'S LAW CENTER TO PREVENT GUN VIOLENCE THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR AND REMAINING MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK HERE TODAY. I'M A SENIOR STAFF ATTORNEY AT DIFFERENT LAW CENTER WE ARE ABOUT THE NATIONAL VIOLENCE PREVENTION ORGANIZATION AND WE ARE BASED IN SAN FRANCISCO AND I'VE BEEN DOING THIS WORK FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS NOW. I'M ALSO PART OF A LARGER COALITION OF MORE THAN THIRTY VIOLENCE PREVENTION AND SOCIAL JUSTICE GROUPS THAT ARE VERY INTERESTED IN IN SUPPORTING AND MAINTAINING FUNDING FOR CAL VIP. CALIFORNIA AND WE KNOW IN THE WAKE OF THE PARKLAND SHOOTING. OUR ENTIRE NATION IS LOOKING FOR SOLUTIONS TO GUN VIOLENCE AS WE SHOULD BE AS YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA HAS SOME OF THE NATION'S STRONGEST GUN LAWS BUT WHERE WE FALL BEHIND SOME OF OUR PEERS INCLUDING NEW YORK MASSACHUSETTS AND CONNECTICUT. IS THAT WE ARE NOT INVESTING AS STRONGLY AS WE COULD BE IN EVIDENCE BASED AND COMMUNITY DRIVEN INTERVENTION PROGRAMS TO ADDRESS SERIOUS VIOLENCE. SO WE CONTINUE TO HAVE A GUN VIOLENCE PROBLEM IN THE STATE MORE THAN THIRTEEN HUNDRED PEOPLE ARE KILLED EACH YEAR BY FIREARMS ANOTHER FOUR THOUSAND ARE NON FATALLY INJURED. AND MOST OF THE SHOOTINGS ARE CONCENTRATED DISPROPORTIONATELY IN UNDERSERVED AREAS AND OUR URBAN COMMUNITIES. AND THAT THOSE FOR THOSE SHOOTINGS BOTH FAILING ON FETAL CREATE AN ENORMOUS COST FOR OUR STATE THAT WE ESTIMATE MORE THAN SIX BILLION DOLLARS. IN COST GENERATED HEALTHCARE LAW ENFORCEMENT COSTS LOST WAGES ETCETERA. AND IT'S INCUMBENT UPON US TO INVEST TO REDUCE THEIR SHOOTING. DOT THE INTERVENTION PROGRAMS ARE TALKING ABOUT ARE ALL BASED ON THE PREMISE THAT A VERY SMALL PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE DRIVE MO SHOOTINGS. IN OUR CITIES AND BY INTERVENING IN A TIMELY AND EVIDENCE BASED WAY WE CAN SEE VERY RAPID REDUCTIONS IN SHOOTINGS THAT YOU ALREADY HEARD CITIES LIKE LA. OAKLAND IN RICHMOND WHICH HAVE RECEIVED SUPPORT FROM THIS PROGRAM OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS HAVE HAD INCREDIBLE SUCCESS AND WE'RE LOOKING TO BUILD ON THAT BY INCREASING FUNDING FOR THIS PROGRAM. TAKES IF YOU SOMEWHAT FOURTH YEAH I'LL JUST SUMMARIZE THAT AS PART OF THE EXECUTIVE STEERING COMMITTEE OF CAL VIP WHERE I SET WE JUST ISSUED OUR LAST THAT OF OF OUR S. B. IS LAST WEEK. MORE THAN A HUNDRED AND TWENTY CITIES AND CBO'S WERE APPLYING FOR THIS FUNDING WE CAN ONLY GIVE. THAT TWENTY GRANTS THERE ANOTHER TWENTY APPLICATIONS THAT RECEIVED VERY HIGH SCORES INCLUDING COMMUNITIES IN SALINAS BAKERSFIELD LONG BEACH IN FRESNO ALL AREAS WITH HIGH LEVELS OF GUN VIOLENCE. THAT COULD NOT RECEIVE GRANTS SIMPLY BECAUSE THERE WASN'T ENOUGH FUNDING SO WE THINK IT'S HIGH TIME THAT OUR STATE COMBINED ARE STRONG GUN LAWS WITH A VERY STRONG AND STRATEGIC INVESTMENT IN THE STRATEGIES THANK YOU. DO WE HAVE A. YOU ARE CURRENTLY BEING FUNDED SO THE FUNDING GOES UNTIL WHEN AT THAT THE NINE MILLION DOLLARS. YOU KNOW WHEN THE FUNDING ENDS RIGHT NOW THE CURRENT GRANT WHICH JUST WAS ISSUED LAST WEEK WILL GO FOR TWO YEARS SOCA. BUT IT'S JUST FOR NINE MILLION SO EACH TO EACH COMMUNITY FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS WITH THE MOST THE COMMUNITY CAN GET SO ESSENTIALLY THEY'RE GETTING TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. FOR PER YEAR FOR TWO YEARS AND THEN THAT WILL RUN OUT FOR THE NINE MILLION IS FOR TWO YEARS AND SO THIS REQUEST IS TO BEGIN. VISIT DOUBLE IT ARE AND TO BEGIN IT. FORT IN TWO YEARS OR SO THE SAME YOU THIS YEAR COULD BE THE SAME YEAR THIS YEAR ISSUE OKAY ALRIGHT OKAY. ANY ANY COMMENTS FROM ANYONE IN THE AUDIENCE. PLEASE JUST GIVE US YOUR NAME AGENCY REPRESENTED WHETHER YOU FOR OPPOSED OR. A FOR THE PROPOSAL. GOOD AFTERNOON LAURIE JOHNSON ON BEHALF OF THE CITIES OF SALINAS SEASIDE IN WATSONVILLE STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS CHRISTIAN FRANCO. I WORK FOR ORGANIZATION CALLED ME BY THE ACRONYM STANDS FOR MOTIVATED INDIVIDUAL LEADERSHIP REPUBLIC ADVANCEMENT WORK IN ORGANIZING A. NONPROFIT AND I WORK REGIONALLY AND A LOT OF THE CITIES AND I JUST SEE THE COLLABORATION IS GOING ON WITH THE COMMUNITY AND ALL THE AGENCIES COMING TOGETHER. SO AN INCREASE OF FUNDS IS IS WITH DESIRE I'M A STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS A BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OKAY I ASSUME I DON'T HAVE ANY MORE QUESTIONS AND EVERYONE ELSE MUST NOT TO THE LEFT ME OVER. SO ANYWAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THINK ABOUT A FEW THINGS YOU THAT YOUR TANK OKAY. WOULD BACK TO BURKE A BAKER EXCUSE ME BAKER. WHO? IS HERE NOW INSERTING VERTICAL PROSECUTION. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND I RUN FAST FROM ONE COMMUNITY TO ANOTHER ADULT AT. ALL WALDRON FASTER NEXT TIME. I'M HERE TO PRESENT SO I BIPARTISAN BUDGET REQUEST FOR FUNDING FOR FEAR OF VERTICAL PROSECUTION. OF CRIMINAL CASES OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING. WE KNOW HUMAN TRAFFICKING IS. CERTAINLY IT IS A MODERN DAY SLAVERY BUT IT'S ALSO THE FASTEST GROWING CRIMINAL ENTERPRISE IN THE UNITED STATES. AND EVERY YEAR THERE'S AN ESTIMATED SEVENTEEN THOUSAND PEOPLE TRAFFIC JUST INTO THE UNITED STATES. AS THIS CRIME CONTINUES TO GROW IN MY A DISTRICT ALONE JUST IN MY FIRST TWO YEARS THREE. OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING RINGS ARE BROKEN UP INCLUDING ONE OF THE LARGEST IN THE COUNTRY AND THOSE WERE JUST AND SMALL TOWN NEIGHBORHOODS. AND THE FBI HAS THREE CAL HAS FOUND THE CALIFORNIA HAS THREE OF THE FBI'S TOP TEN HUMAN TRAFFICKING HOT SPOTS OF FOR THE UNITED STATES. AND VERTICAL PROSECUTION IS ONE OF THE MANY EFFECTIVE TOOLS THAT WE CAN HAVE A FIGHT HUMAN TRAFFICKING WOULD VERTICAL PROSECUTION IS IT MEANS THAT WHEN THE CASE IS BEING PROSECUTED THERE'S WENDY A FROM THE START OF THE CASE. ALL THE WAY TO THE VERY END INSTEAD OF THE NEW DA AT EVERY STAGE OF THAT CASE. THERE'S MULTIPLE BENEFITS FROM THIS FIRST AND FOREMOST IT'S A VICTIM CENTERED FORM OF PROSECUTION VICTIMS OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING CASES ARE TRAUMATIZED A THEY TEND HAVE MANY OF THE SAME QUALITIES THAT A VICTIM OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND SPELLS ABUSE HAS. AND. IT TAKES AWHILE TO COOPERATE WITH AN ATTORNEY WITH STANDARD PROSECUTION THEY HAVE TO. RE ESTABLISH A RELATIONSHIP WITH A NEW PERSON EACH TIME AND THAT MAKES IT NOT ONLY DIFFICULT FOR THE VICTIM BUT MAKES IT MORE DIFFICULT TO PROSECUTE THE CASES AND THEY END UP EITHER I'M PROSECUTED OR. OFTEN PLAYED DOWN TO LESSER CRIMES AND. IN ADDITION THE DA'S WHO ARE WORKING IN VERTICAL PROSECUTION SYSTEMS ARE ABLE TO GET VERY GOOD AT THOSE CASES THAT ARE QUITE COMPLEX. AND SO WE'VE SEEN THE SUCCESS OF THESE PROGRAMS I IN OTHER PARTS OF CALIFORNIA INCLUDING ALAMEDA COUNTY. WHICH IS ONE OF THE LEADING AT COUNTIES IN THE STATE FOR PROSECUTING HUMAN TRAFFICKING CASES AND ALSO. ALLOWING VICTIMS TO GO FORWARD WITH THEIR LIVES TO BEGIN TO REBUILD THEM. I I WILL SAY THAT THIS IS A PARTICULARLY NEEDED FUNDING NOW BECAUSE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS DISCONTINUING ITS GRANTS TO STATES UP TO FIGHT VERTICAL BUT HUMAN TRAFFICKING THROUGH VERTICAL PROSECUTION IT'S REALLY TIME FOR US TO STEP UP. AND SO I THINK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS AND WITH ME TODAY SHAUN HOFFMAN FROM THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION. THANK YOU THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I'M. THESE VERBAL PROSECUTION UNITS AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER BAKER. SPOKE TO. THEY'RE VERY IMPORTANT WE'RE DEALING WITH VICTIMS OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING IT CLEARLY YOUNG VICTIMS. WERE VERY VULNERABLE AND CREATING THAT STRUCTURE IN WHICH WERE ABLE TO DEVELOP A RELATIONSHIP OF TRUST BETWEEN THE VICTIM THE PROSECUTORS PROVEN TO BE. A VERY EFFECTIVE METHOD OF PROSECUTING HUMAN TRAFFICKING IN THE COUNTIES THAT HAVE THE RESOURCES TO DO SO. THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER MENTIONED ALAMEDA COUNTY WHERE DISTRICT ATTORNEY NANCY O'MALLEY IS IS ONE OF THE. EXPERTS ON ON THE ISSUE OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING NOT JUST IN CALIFORNIA BUT IN THE NATION. THEY'VE A RESEARCH INSTITUTE THAT IS LOOKED AT THE TRAUMA SUFFERED BY VICTIMS OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING. ONE OF THE COMMONALITIES THAT THEY'VE FOUND IN TALKING TO OVER TO OVER A HUNDRED SURVIVORS OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING. IS THAT PARTICULARLY YOUNG PEOPLE WHO'VE BEEN BEEN TRAFFICKED. IS THAT MANY OF THEY HAVE MANY LAYERS OF TRAUMA. STARTING IN EARLY CHILDHOOD MANY OF THEM EXPERIENCE HOME LIFE THAT'S NOT SAFE THEY'VE EXPERIENCED SEXUAL ASSAULT SEXUAL ABUSE MEN ON INTO HUMAN TRAFFICKING WHICH IS THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER SAID IS. REALLY MODERN DAY SLAVERY ME SURVIVORS OF SPOKE AT LENGTH ABOUT THE LACK OF STABILITY OR CONSISTENCY THROUGHOUT THEIR LIVES MAY BE MOVING FROM ONE FOSTER HOME TO ANOTHER FOSTER HOME. FROM ONE SOCIAL WORKER TO ANOTHER SOCIAL WORKER THAT SORT OF CONSTANT CHANGING CHAOS REALLY BREEDS THE VULNERABILITY THAT TRAFFICKERS PREY ON. AND SO THEIR EXPERIENCE HAVING PROSECUTED ALMOST SIX HUNDRED HUMAN TRAFFICKERS IS THE REVERSE VERTICAL PROSECUTION MODEL ISN'T HELPFUL JUST IN TERMS OF BRINGING THESE TRAFFICKERS TO JUSTICE. BUT IN BEGINNING TO REPAIR. THAT VICTIM AND BRING SOME STABILITY TO THEIR LIVES WHICH LAST LONG BEYOND THE OUTCOME TRIAL SO. HUMAN TRAFFICKING BEING A PROBLEM OBVIOUSLY IN IN SOME OF THE LARGER MORE WELL RESOURCE COUNTIES. IS ALSO A PROBLEM IN A LOT OF SMALLER COUNTIES TOWNS DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS WHICH IS WHY THIS BUDGET REQUEST IS SO CRITICAL SO. UP WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME ASK YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU ANYONE IN THE AUDIENCE. WAS GIVE YOUR NAME AND YOUR AGENCY REPRESENT IN THE POSITION THAT YOU TAKE ON THIS ISSUE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR DON CAP KEY ON BEHALF OF CRIME VICTIMS UNITED CALIFORNIANS STRONG SUPPORT. MY UNDERSTANDING IS VERTICAL PROSECUTION CURRENTLY EXIST IN SOME AREAS IRAQ TO. AND. SO. WHAT WHAT THE DISH NO RESOURCES ARE NECESSARY TO TO? TO IMPLEMENT I ME. MY ASSUMPTION IS THAT. THAT THOSE OFFICES THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE A VERY WHOEVER COULD ACTUALLY DO THIS ALREADY I ASSUME. OF SO WHY WOULD WE FUNDING SOMETHING THEY CAN ALREADY DO BUDGET TWO PARTS TO THAT AND CERTAINLY WELCOME MAT MISTER HOFFMAN'S IF THE FIRST IS THAT AT THIS BODY IN TWENTY THIRTEEN THROUGH A HEARINGS FOUND THAT. IF WE WERE ABLE TO FIND VERTICAL PROSECUTION AND JUSTIN NINE TO ELEVEN COUNTIES THAT DID NOT HAVE THE FUNDING TO COMMIT TO THOSE PARTICULAR. STYLE OF OF PROSECUTION THAT WE COULD MAKE GREAT HEADWAY IN THOSE COUNTIES WITH HUMAN TRAFFICKING CASES BUT IT WAS THE BUDGET. HELP THAT THEY NEEDED IN ORDER CASES THEY TAKE MORE RESOURCES. AND AS IN ANY CASE WHEN WE'RE FINDING THAT WE HAVE A PARTICULAR PROBLEM WITH A FAST GROWING CRIME IN OUR AREA WE WANT TO MAKE SURE MAKING THE INVESTMENT OF RESOURCES TO DO IT. AND SO IT'S TO BE PARTNERS AT THE STATE LEVEL AYE WITH RDA OFFICES ALSO REALIZING THAT THE STATE. PEOPLE ARE TRAFFICKED ACROSS COUNTY LINES AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THIS SHOULD BE A STATE PRIORITY MYSELF AND PROPS MISTER HOFFMAN CAN ALSO ADD TO THAT. SURE I WOULD HAVE SEEN IN SOME OF THE LARGER OFFICES WHERE WE DO SEE THESE VERTICAL PROSECUTION UNITS. THEY HAVE A NUMBER OF ATTORNEYS AND THEY'RE ABLE TO KIND OF. SILO THEM INTO PARTICULAR AREAS OF EXPERTISE YOU GET INTO SMALLER COUNTIES WERE YOU TALKING ABOUT MAYBE HAVING. EIGHT OR NINE PROSECUTORS IN THAT OFFICE THERE CAN HANDLING EVERYTHING THEY'RE HANDLING HUMAN TRAFFICKING THEY'RE HANDLING. A YOU KNOW A ROBBERY THEIR HANDLING. DRUG SALES THERE IF THEY'RE HANDLING KIND OF EVERYTHING THAT THAT COMES IN THERE AND SO. THEY'D THEY DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES TO SAY OKAY THIS PROSECUTOR IS HANDLING ALL OF THE HUMAN TRAFFICKING CASES AND THAT IS. THE ONLY THING THEY'RE HANDLING SO THEY'RE DEVELOPING A RELATIONSHIP WITH THE WITH THE VICTIMS THEIR DEVELOPING THE EXPERTISE WITH THAT PARTICULAR TYPE OF OFFENSE. THESE GRANT FUNDS WOULD BE ABLE TO. IDEALLY PLACE A PROSECUTOR DEDICATED TO THAT PARTICULAR OFFENSE IN THOSE PARTICULAR VICTIMS IN THESE OFFICES WHERE RIGHT NOW. THEY'RE REALLY KIND OF DEALING WITH WHATEVER COMES UP AS IT COMES NAY DON'T HAVE THAT. THAT THAT LEVEL OF EXPERTISE TO TO DEAL WITH THAT. WHY IS WHAT AND I ASK THAT THINK EARLIER WHITES IT WITH OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES? OH YES ARE THEY ARE THE THE PAST HEREDITY FOR A LOT OF OUR FEDERAL GRANTS THAT WE GET THROUGH THE FEDERAL DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. PERHAPS THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER COULD SPEAK TO WHY THEY'VE BEEN CHOSEN FOR THIS PARTICULAR ONE BUT WE DO RECEIVE A LOT OF GRANT FUNDING. THROUGH OH YES IT'S PRETTY WELL NOT TO REINVENT THE WHEEL. LET'S NOT TRY TO RE INVENT A WHOLE NEW LEVEL OF EXPERTISE AND FAMILIARITY WITH OUR STATE GOVERNMENT FOR HOW TO MANAGE THOSE GRANTS AND LOOK AT THE APPLICATIONS LIKE WHAT TO DO. WE WANNA MAKE SURE THE DOLLARS GO AS FAR AS THEY POSSIBLY CAN AND BUILDING ON THAT KNOWLEDGE OF RESOURCES WE'VE ALREADY CULTIVATED IN THE STATUS IMPORTANT TO DO. FOCA. ALRIGHT. THE GOING TO THE COURSE THANK YOU THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR IT THANK YOU. WELL THAT BRINGS US TO COURTS SO WHAT. STARBASE. EVERYBODY. THANK A MATTER MADAM CHAIR AND. MEMBERS. UP WHAT WE'RE HERE TO PRESENT AND ASK FOR A ONE TIME BUDGET ASK OF ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION FOR THE CALIFORNIA MILITARY DEPARTMENT TO EXPAND THE STARBASE. YOUTH PROGRAM AT THE JOINT FORCES TRAINING BASE AND LOOKS ALAMEDA THOSE. I HAD OPPORTUNITY TO GO VISIT THE STARBASE PROGRAM THIS LAST SUMMER ALONG WITH SPEAK IT SPEAKER UP RENDON AND WHAT WE SAW THERE. WAS A REALLY ALL OF THE THINGS THAT I THINK WE SEE AN EDUCATION AS BEST PRACTICES WHICH WERE WERE STUDENTS THAT WERE NOT ONLY ENGAGED BUT WERE ACTIVE WERE MOVING AROUND FROM STATION TO STATION. VERY QUALIFIED TEACHING STAFF WITH TEACHERS WITH CREDENTIALS ARE AGAIN SET IT SET THE SETTING OUT TO LOS ALAMOS ME NO SOME. OF LOS ELEMENTOS MILITARY BASE. FOR SOME OF YOU WHO MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN IN THE CLASSROOM AND A WHILE I WE ALWAYS KNOW THAT WHEN STUDENTS HAVE THE CHANCE TO GET OFF CAMPUS INTO ANOTHER SETTING THIS ALSO INCREASES THE LEARNING. FOR THEM THIS IS ALL SO BRING STUDENTS IN NOT ONLY FROM ORANGE COUNTY BUT FROM LOS ANGELES AND BRITNEY DO YOU KNOW RIVERSIDE AND SAN DIEGO. COUNTIES IT'S A PROGRAM WHERE STUDENTS COME FOR FIVE DAYS A WEEK UP THEY DO NOT SPEND THE NIGHT. BUT THEY ARE THERE FIVE CONSECUTIVE DAYS AYE IT THIS IS A PROGRAM THAT IS UP PAID FOR WITH FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PAYS FOR ALL OPERATING COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH STARBASE. AND THE STATE. WOULD THEN THAT MATCHING PART WOULD BE TO PROVIDE THE CLASSROOM SO THIS BUDGET OFGEM AUGMENTATION WOULD ALLOW FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF A NEW A THREE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED SQUARE FOOT BUILDING. AND WITH THAT TO A WE HAVE A COLONEL DARREL DARREN VENDOR HERE. THE SHOW IS SUPPORT OKAY. HI MADAM CHAIR A I'M DARYN BENDER I WORK WITH A CALIFORNIA MILITARY DEPARTMENT THIS IS NOT. IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET SO I CAN'T SUPPORT IT. BUT I CAN. SPECIFIED TO SOME FACTS AND ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. AND SO THE ONLY. BACKS THAT ALL SPECIFIED TO YOU ARE HOW WE. JUDGE. EXCESS IN OUR STARBASE PROGRAM. WE JUST LIKE JUDGE SUCCESS BASED ON TEST SCORES THAT WE TEST THE STUDENTS. WHEN THEY COME IN AND THEN WE TESTED WHEN THEY COME OUT AND THE AVERAGE SCORE GOES FROM. OUT OF A HUNDRED FROM A FIFTY FOUR ON AVERAGE TO A TO A NINETY. IN TERMS OF A MATCH A SCIENCE SKILLS AND STEM SKILLS. WE ALSO JUDGE THE PROGRAM'S SUCCESS BASED ON DEMAND INCREASING DEMAND AND THEY'RE SO MUCH DEMAND NOW THAT WE HAVE TO SAY NO TO FORTY SIX SCHOOLS. IN THOSE COUNTIES THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER QUIRK SILVA MENTIONED. THAT'S ROUGHLY TWO THOUSAND STUDENTS THAT WANT TO PARTICIPATE BUT CAN'T SO THIS. A NEW FACILITY THIS NEW CLASSROOM WILL ALLOW THAT THIS FEDERAL PROGRAM TO EXPAND TO INCLUDE ALL FORTY SIX OF THOSE CLASSES THAT ARE ON THE WAIT LIST. AND THIS IS. THAT THIS. YOUNG PEOPLE SPENT A WEEK AT THIS PLACE IS THAT CORRECT YES MA'AM OKAY AND SO THE FUNDING THE FUNDING FOR THAT KIND OF PROGRAM IS DONE THROUGH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS THAT CORRECT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PAYS FOR THE TEACHERS AND FOR ALL OF THE SCHOOL SUPPLIES AND ALL THE. EQUIPMENT THEY HAVE THREE D. PRINTERS THEY HAVE SIMULATION SOFTWARE THE UPROOTED MATT. PROTOTYPING SOFTWARE ALL KINDS OF REALLY HIGH TECH GADGETS ALL PAID FOR BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS DOES THIS BUDGET ALLOCATION IS DESIGNED FOR CONSTRUCTION OF FACILITY. FOR ONE CLASSROOM YASSIN A MILLION ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS TO BILL AND FUND THE SCHOOLS RESPONSIBILITY AS FOR THE TRANSPORTATION AND I KNOW THAT SEVERAL OF THEM ARE ABLE TO ALSO. APPLY FOR GRANTS WITHIN THEIR DISTRICTS BUT YES IT'S ONE ONE. IF IT'S A PORTABLE TOILETS THAT SET SO WE HAVE A. TRAINING BASE IN LOS ALAMEDA IS THAT ALREADY HAS AN EXISTING STARBASE CLASSROOMS OF THIS WOULD BE AN EXACT DUPLICATE. BUILT RIGHT NEXT TO IT SO THAT THE TWO PROGRAMS ARE COMBINED SO WE ALREADY HAVE THE DID THE BUILDING DESIGNED. THIS WOULD JUST BE THE CONSTRUCTION SO IT'S IT'S TO CLASSROOMS AND RESTROOMS IN ABOUT THIRTY FIVE HUNDRED SQUARE FEET. RIGHT THERE ON PROPERTY THAT'S ALREADY CONTROLLED BY THAT. THAT CALIFORNIA MILITARY DEPARTMENT SO THERE'S NO LAND COSTS. AND THE DESIGN IS ALREADY. I'M PRETTY MUCH COMPLETE IT WOULD JUST HAVE TO BE. UPDATED SO THERE'S VERY LITTLE IN TERMS OF DESIGN COST AS WELL THIS IS ALL PRETTY MUCH CONSTRUCTION. NO PROGRAM WHICH UP IS THE SUN AS THE SUN BURST. THE SUNBURST YOUTH ACADEMY WHERE THEY HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS THAT ARE. HAPPY STRUGGLING THROUGH HIGH SCHOOL SAID THAT IS AN ACTUAL PROGRAM WHERE THEY LIVE ON THE BASE SO THIS WAS BROUGHT FORWARD OUT WITH FORMER SPEAKER JOHN PEREZ. HIT THIS THIS THAT WAS THAT THE ORIGINAL CLASSROOM CAME THROUGH HIS INVESTMENT SO WITHOUT IS NOW BEEN ABOUT FOUR YEARS. AND NOW BECAUSE IT'S GROW ON THE SECOND ASKA. IS FOR THIS ADDITIONAL CLASSROOM. NOW. AND THERE'S ONLY ONE OF THESE IN THE STATE THERE'S ONE HERE IN SACRAMENTO AS WELL FOLK AND IT'S LOCATED IN SOUTH SACRAMENTO NEAR. TOLD BT COLLINS RESERVE BASE AND. WE HAVE AN ARMORY THERE AND IT'S LOCATED ADJACENT TO THE ARMY SAID ONLY HOW MANY KIDS ARE SERVED IN THIS BUT IN THIS PROGRAM SO RIGHT NOW THERE ARE THREE THOUSAND. STUDENTS THAT GO THROUGH EVERY YEAR THAT GOES WITH PROGRAM IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND DISTILLING THIS'LL INCREASE THAT NUMBER TO FIVE THOUSAND TOTAL. OKAY. DO YOU HAVE ANY DATA ON THE IMPACT OF THE PROGRAM ON KIDS WHEN THEY LEAVE. SO WHAT THEY CHOOSE TO DO ARE. NOW WHAT WE REALLY DON'T I MEAN. WE WERE HOPING THAT THE COURSE THE HOPE IS THAT IT SPARKED SOMETHING IN THE STUDENT THAT WILL. PROP THEM TO PROCEED. WITH. AND EDUCATION IN THE STEM. SUBJECTS THETEACHERS AS WELL SO THE TEACHERS LEARN SOMETHING TO THE TEACHERS ARE GIVEN. A CURRICULUM AND TOOLS. TO TAKE BACK TO THE CLASSROOM TO TO IN TO IT ESSENTIALLY EXTEND THE STARBASE EXPERIENCE BACK IN THEIR SCHOOL. THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE DOES NOT KEEP STATISTICS. ON. ON ALL OF THE THE KIDS THAT ATTEND THIS PROGRAM NATIONWIDE. BUT BECAUSE IT'S BEEN FUNDED FOR ABOUT TWENTY YEARS. I THINK WE CAN ASSUME THAT IT. THAT THERE ARE THERE HAVE BEEN STUDIES DONE WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT THAT. OKAY I HAVE SOME DIRECT TESTIMONY SO FROM THE TEACHERS THAT I'VE WORKED WITH OF THE INTO A WE ALWAYS GET. UP ASKED TO PARTICIPATE IN VARIOUS PROGRAMS THROUGHOUT THE YEARS AND SOMETIMES THEY ARE AS EXCITING AS EXPECTED AND AND THE STUDENTS COME AWAY WITH A GREAT EXPERIENCE AND SOMETIMES THEY'RE NOT. THIS ONE PARTICULARLY I KNOW THAT BECAUSE I HAVEN'T BEEN A VENN OUT OF THE CLASSROOM SOME OF THE TEACHERS HAVE SAID THAT THEY FELT THAT IT'S BEEN REALLY IMPACTFUL BECAUSE IT'S ALLOWING THEM TO DO THINGS ON SITE THAT THEY. CAN'T NECESSARILY DO IN A CLASSROOM IT'S A LAB SETTING THERE'S A ROOMS THAT ALL SO FORTH SO. I KNOW ONE OF GROUP MISTER SPEAKER AND I VISITED WE WERE REALLY IMPRESSED THEY WERE DOING A GOOD. HOME. TAKING A EGG DEL ANNA. WHAT WAS THAT PROJECT IT WAS SAID THEY WERE PROTOTYPING A OF A VESSEL THAT WOULD PROTECT DAY YEAH A CHICKEN AND EGG? AS IT TRAVELED DOWN A WIRE ABOUT TWENTY FEET INTO A. HARD SURFACE AND SO. THEIR TASK WAS TO DESIGN NECK. A VEHICLE TO CARRY THAT THE ACT AND THEN THEY ACTUALLY WENT OUT AND TESTED IT. AS PART OF A. THE EXPERIMENT.

GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR OF JOINING ME HERE TODAY SENATOR JIM BELL BALFE I'M MICHAEL CHAMPION IN THE SENATE FOR THIS BUDGET REQUEST. AND I TOGETHER WITH THE SUPPORT OF TWENTY NINE ADDITIONAL LEGISLATORS AND OVER ONE HUNDRED ORGANIZATIONS WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT OF A FIFTY. MILLION ONGOING ALLOCATION TO CREATE A DOMESTIC AND SEXUAL VIOLENCE COMPLEMENTARY UP PREVENTION AND SERVICE FUND ADMINISTERED THROUGH THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES. DESPITE A SHARP INCREASE IN NEED AVAILABLE FUNDING FOR DOMESTIC AND SEXUAL VIOLENCE HAS REMAINED STAGNANT OVER THE LAST DECADE. RAPE CRISIS PROGRAMS ARE ONLY FUNDED AT FORTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS. SO THE NEED TO SAY THAT AGAIN ONLY FORTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS FURTHERMORE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE PROGRAMS HAVE NOT RECEIVED A BUDGETARY INCREASE IN OVER TWENTY YEARS. WE MUST INCREASE FUNDING FOR SERVICES THAT INCLUDE PREVENTATIVE EFFORTS RESEARCH. BUT ALSO HOUSING ILLEGAL SUPPORT HERE WITH ME TODAY ARE THE ADVOCATES WHO ARE WORKING TIRELESSLY AND HAVE DATA TO SUPPORT A REQUEST. THUNDER AND BECAUSE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER. FOR THE CALIFORNIA COALITION AGAINST SEXUAL ASSAULT. AYE CHRIS DARDEN INSECT PUBLIC POLICY MANAGER FOR THE CALIFORNIA PARTNERSHIPS ON DOMESTIC VIOLENCE BUT FIRST IF I HAVE A SENATOR BELLOW WOULD LIKE SAFETY WORK THAT WOULD. IF YOU DO IT. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR OF ITS PLEASURE TO BE IN THE ASSEMBLY HERE. AND ADDING TO. ASSEMBLY WOMAN. RUBIO'S COMMENTS SEXUAL VIOLENCE. ACOSTA HUNDRED FORTY BILLION DOLLARS. IN CALIFORNIA AND. ONE TIME FUNDING DOES NOT ADDRESS TO REOCCURRING COST. AND THE NEED FOR SERVICES WITHOUT FUNDING FOR A LONG TERM SERVICES. CLING FLEXIBLE FUNDING FOR HOUSING AND COMPREHENSIVE CASE MANAGEMENT SERVICES SURVIVORS AND THEIR FAMILIES CYCLE FROM ONE CRISIS TO ANACS. SURVIVORS NEED SOLID ONGOING FUNDING. THE KEY INVESTMENT MAY STRENGTHENS THE STATE'S RESPONSE TO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND SEXUAL VIOLENCE BEYOND JUST THE MOMENT OF CRISIS. IT MAKES FINANCIAL SENSE TO REDUCE THE LONG TERM COST BY FOCUSING ON PREVENTION A WRAPAROUND SUPPORT SERVICES. AND NOW I'M SAYING THIS ON BEHALF OF THE SENATE. MEMBERS IT SIGNED. THE PETITION FOR THIS MEASURE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND. WE APPRECIATE YOUR CONSIDERATION OKAY THANK YOU. YEAH THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE ON MY NAME IS SANDRA BECAUSE SOMETIMES HE EL THE CALIFORNIA COALITION AGAINST SEXUAL ASSAULT. AND ID LIKE TO SPEAK WITH YOU BOTH ABOUT SEXUAL AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ON I WANTED TO START A LITTLE BIT ABOUT SEXUAL VIOLENCE. WE HAVE IN THE PAST. TRIED TO SEEK SUPPORT. FROM THE CALIFORNIA STATE GENERAL FUND. AND THAT HAS NOT BEEN SUCCESSFUL AND SO AND NUMBER AND TWENTY TWELVE WE COMMISSIONED. THAN A LEADING RESEARCHER IN THE NATION TO DO A REPORT ON WHAT THE US. SEXUAL VIOLENCE COST THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THAT CAME OUT TO BE. FOR TANGIBLE COST. AND THEY WERE LOOKING AT A SNAPSHOT OF TWENTY TWELVE. WHERE WE? HAVE A TOTAL INCIDENT OF RAPE OR SEXUAL ASSAULT THAT EXCEEDED OVER ONE POINT ONE MILLION. AND SO IN TERMS OF THE TANGIBLE COSTS THAT CAME TO NINE BILLION DOLLARS AND THAT INCLUDED THINGS LIKE. OVER NINE BILLION DOLLARS INCLUDING THINGS LIKE THE MEDICAL HEALTH CARE MENTAL HEALTH CARE PROPERTY DAMAGE VICTIM SERVICES AND EDUCATION. THOSE ARE DIRECT COST THAT WE CAN TRACE ON THEM WHEN WE LOOK AT INTANGIBLE COSTS WHICH INCLUDE THINGS LIKE LOSS OF. WORK PRODUCTIVITY. GROWING EARNING LOSS WHILE CONFINED AND LOST A QUALITY OF LIFE LIFE THAT COMES TO. A HUNDRED AND THIRTY BILLION DOLLARS. AND ALMOST TWO THIRDS OF THOSE COST WE WERE TALKING ABOUT EIGHTY NINE POINT SEVEN BILLION SO NEARLY NINETY BILLION IS RESULT OF SEXUAL ABUSE AGAINST CHILDREN. IN OUR STATE. SO. AS. BOTH THE SENATOR AND THE ASSEMBLY WOMAN MENTIONED ALREADY. STATE GENERAL FUND CURRENTLY. COMMITS ONLY FORTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS FORTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS TO THE ENTIRE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE AND HOW THAT HAS BEEN THE CASE FOR MANY MANY YEARS. AND IN TWENTY FOURTEEN CALIFORNIA HAD BENEFITED FROM. FUNDS TO DO PREVENTION EFFORTS AROUND THE STATE AND. THERE WAS THE. RE FORMULA REFORMULATION OF THE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT WHICH RESULTED IN CALIFORNIA LOSING. A MILLION DOLLARS AND THE RESULT OF THAT IS THAT. EVERY COUNTY NO LONGER HAS THE BENEFIT OF PREVENTING TRYING TO PREVENT THIS. SO WHERE WHERE WE'RE LOOKING AT THAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THE REPORT ALSO REVEALS IS THAT EVERY PREVENTED RAPE OF AN ADULT COULD SAVE CALIFORNIA A HUNDRED AND SIXTY THREE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS. AND EVERY PREVENTED RAPE OF A SEXUAL ASSAULT OF A CHILD. SAVE CALIFORNIA TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED WE FEEL LIKE THIS IS A PRETTY GOOD INVESTMENT BECAUSE OF THE AMOUNT THE CALIFORNIA'S CURRENTLY PUTTING OUT SOMEWHAT BICU. GONNA. WE GIVE YOU FIVE MINUTES REACH YES FORGET OVER SOME IF YOU SOME OF. SO JUST QUICKLY. IN TERMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE WE BROUGHT THESE TWO ISSUES TOGETHER. BECAUSE. IT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IS ONE OF THE LEADING CAUSES OF HOMELESSNESS AMONG WOMEN AND. WE CURRENTLY ARE LOOKING TO PROVIDE OTHER ADDITIONAL SERVICES THAT WE CANNOT CURRENTLY PROVIDE. ON WE HAVE A HUGE FOCUS IN THIS. REQUEST AROUND PREVENTION BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THAT IS WE NEED TO GO UPSTREAM AND PREVENT THIS FROM HAPPENING IN ADDITION TO ADDRESSING THE NEEDS OF THOSE THAT ARE VICTIMIZED. BUT WE NEED TO PREVENT IT FROM HAPPENING BY WORKING ON SYSTEMS WITH INDIVIDUALS THAT POTENTIAL VICTIMS AND PARTICULARLY. CHANGING. ATTITUDES IT THANK YOU VERY MUCH BOB DID YOU HAVE SOMETHING THAT YOU WANT TO COMMENT VERY BRIEFLY.

IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO THEM OUR LOCAL BUSINESS OWNERS AS WELL AS THOSE WHO ARE VISITING THE BAY AREA FOR BOTH BUSINESS AND LEISURE. I LIKE TAKE A MOMENT TO PROVIDE YOU LOCAL BRIEF OVERVIEW INTO THE PLAY CAN SITUATION. OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS FROM TWENTY FOURTEEN TO TWENTY SEVENTEEN WE'VE ACTUALLY SEEN A HUNDRED AND THIRTY THREE PERCENT INCREASE AND THIS PARTICULAR TYPE OF CRIME. WITH TWENTY SIXTEEN TO TWENTY SEVENTEEN BEING AS OUR HIGHEST SINGLE YEAR JUMP WITH THE SIXTY PERCENT JOB JUST IN THAT ONE YEAR. IF YOU COMMITTEE COULD PROVIDE US THE REQUESTED SUPPORT IT WOULD ALLOW US THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE THE RESOURCES FOR A SUSTAINED COLLABORATIVE EFFORT. WITH OUR COMMUNITY MEMBERS ARE LOCAL BUSINESSES AND REGIONAL PUBLIC SAFETY PARTNERS IN ORDER TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM. SOME OF THE OVER ARCHING PRONGS OF THE SUSTAIN MULTI PRONGED APPROACH WOULD INCLUDE COMMUNITY AWARENESS AND PARTNERSHIPS FOR EXAMPLE BY EXPANDING OUR COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT PERSONNEL IN ORDER TO MAXIMIZE OUR REACH. THROUGH CAMPAIGNS. THROUGH LOCAL MEDIA LOCAL COMMUNITY GROUPS SUCH AS NEIGHBORHOOD GROUPS VOLUNTEER. CLUBS AND CHAMBERS OF CONGRESS. THIS IN TURN HELPS DECREASED EXPOSURE THE VICTIMIZATION. HI ADDING ANALYTICAL CAPABILITIES WHICH WOULD. WE WOULD BASE OUR POLICING FROM OUR EFFORTS FROM IN A COLLABORATIVE AND DIRECTED SUPER OUR INVESTIGATIVE RESOURCES. TO IDENTIFY PROSECUTE AND DISASSEMBLE THE SOPHISTICATED CRIMINAL ENTERPRISE CREWS THAT WE'VE FIGURED OUT HER. WILL NOT NOT TO HAVE REAL BASIC. EYES WHICH ONE WOULD THINK THAT IF I COULD JUST ADD THAT IT FROM A PERSONAL PERSPECTIVE FROM MY TWENTY OVER TWENTY THREE YEARS AND AND PUBLIC SAFETY THIS IS PROBABLY THE WORST I'VE SEEN.

IT IT WILL GIVE US THE ABILITY TO ENHANCE AND ARE REALLY ALLOW ARE VICTIMS. AND ARE GOOD PEOPLE WHO WANT TO JOIN OUR COMMUNITIES TO FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH ART BY ONE TIME FUNDING REQUEST CORRECT. SO OFTEN THAT'S WOULD BE A ONE TIME FUNDING WONDER HOW DOES THE ISSUE CONTINUE I GUESS. IS THAT IT'S A RESOURCE IS BEING PUT INTO. CAMPAIGNING OR AS A SET SIGNED SIR IS THAT WHAT THIS IS ABOUT HOME. MUCH MORE THAN PAROLE PATROL AND SO FORTH AND SO ON THAT WERE THAT WAY SO THAT. YOU WILL BE DOING A LOT OF OF COMMUNITY OUTREACH. NO SIGNS AND CAMPAIGN AND SO ON SO FORTH A HOPE OF. ALSO HOPEFULLY WILL BE ABLE TO AND INCREASED SOME AMOUNT OF FOOD PATROL AND JUST TO TAMPER TO THAT THERE'S STILL A BUT YOU SHOOT DOWN A LITTLE BIT. AND YOU HEARD THE PERCENTAGE OF INCREASE. MY AND ALL THAT THAT NUMBER WILL STACK AND IN MY DISTRICT OR MORE THAN FIVE THOUSAND OBTUSA. WIDOW CHO CRIME A YEAR SO IT IT IT DOESN'T REALLY. EPIDEMIC WOULD REALLY NEED TO ADDRESS IT AND PARTICULAR MUCH FOR YOUR CALL A RACIAL THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK THEM DOWN. THERE MISTER GRAYSON YOU DON'T TWENTY JUSTICE CENTER. YES. GOOD MORNING OR AFTERNOON JULY SAY MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS. I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR CONSIDERATION OF A TEN MILLION DOLLAR DEDICATED FUNDING SOURCE FOR FAMILY JUSTICE CENTERS FAMILY JUSTICE CENTERS ARE COMPREHENSIVE MULTI AGENCY CENTERS THE PROVIDE A ONE STOP SHOP. OF SUPPORT SERVICES OF SURVIVORS OF INTERPERSONAL VIOLENCE WHICH INCLUDES DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CHILD ABUSE ELDERLY ABUSE AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING. THE DEFINING FEATURE OF THE FAMILY JUSTICE CENTER MODEL IS THAT SURVIVORS OF DRAMATIC EVENTS. CAN EXCESS OF ACCESS ALL THE CENTRAL SERVICES WITHOUT HAVING TO TRAVEL TO VARIOUS AGENCIES AND SERVICE PROVIDERS. FAMILY COURT ASSISTANCE MENTAL HEALTH COUNSELING AND HELP OBTAINING RESTRAINING ORDERS ARE JUST A FEW OF THE INDISPENSABLE SERVICES THAT ARE PROVIDED UNDER ONE ROOF. FAMILY JUSTICE CENTERS SERVE THE MOST VULNERABLE OF IN CALIFORNIA'S POPULATION TO GIVE YOU JUST A PICTURE OF WHO THEY SERVE. THE CONTRA COSTA FAMILY JUSTICE CENTER EIGHTY ONE PERCENT OF THEIR CLIENTS HAVE A PRIOR HISTORY WITH CUSTODY OR LAW ENFORCEMENT. SEVENTY SIX PERCENT HAVE CHILDREN. IT'S THE FIVE PERCENT EARN LESS THAN TWO THOUSAND PER MONTH AND TWENTY ONE PERCENT HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO MEDICAL INSURANCE. BECAUSE OF THIS YOU'VE SEEN THAT WE'VE GARNERED THE BIPARTISAN SUPPORT OF DOZENS OF MEMBERS AND SENATORS WHO HAVE FAMILY JUSTICE CENTERS IN SIXTEEN COUNTIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA. WE ALL AGREE THAT THE ONLY WAY TO MEET THE GROWING DEMAND FOR SERVICES AT FAMILY JUSTICE CENTERS IS WITH THE REQUISITE STATE SUPPORT. TO ADDRESS THIS GAP WE'RE PROPOSING THE CREATION OF A SEPARATE DEDICATED FUNDING CATEGORY FOR FAMILY JUSTICE CENTERS UNDER CAL O. YES. THE PROGRAM WOULD PROVIDE COMPETITIVE GRANTS TOTALING TEN MILLION PER YEAR TO THE TWENTY ONE AND COUNTING FAMILY JUSTICE CENTERS ACROSS THE STATE TO PROVIDE ESSENTIAL SERVICES. THANK YOU CHAIR AND MEMBERS I WILL NOW TURN OVER MIGHT NOT THE REST OF TIME JUSTICE ON CAM EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CONTRA COSTA FAMILY JUSTICE CENTER WHO WILL EXPLAIN WHY FUNDING. IS DESPERATELY NEEDED FOR THE FAMILY JUSTICE. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME ASSIST SON KIM I'M THE DIRECTOR OF THE CONTRA COSTA FAMILY JUSTICE AT ALL. I'M A FORMER LEGAL AID LAWYER. WHO USED TO REPRESENT THE MASSIVE BOMB SURVIVORS IN FAMILY LAW MATTERS AND I MOVE FROM LEGALLY TO THE FAMILY JUSTICE CENTERS BECAUSE I BELIEVE IN THE HOLISTIC MODEL? OF PROVIDING SERVICES TO OUR CLIENTS. AND AS YOU NOTICED EARLIER TODAY THERE WERE MANY SPEAKERS WHO SPOKE ABOUT THE MISSING VIOLENCE SEXUAL VIOLENCE TELL DEBUTS IN HUMAN TRAFFICKING. AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS BECAUSE THAT REALLY CONNECTED WHAT WE BELIEVE IS THAT OR DIFFERENT TYPES OF INTERPERSONAL VIOLENCE A CONNECTED THEY CAUSE TRAUMA AND THEY ALSO CAUSE. MAJOR PUBLIC HEALTH CONCERNS AND THE IDEA OF THE FAMILY JUSTICE CENTER IS THROUGH THE SIMPLE WE PROVIDE ONE STOP SERVICES. AND WE HAVE GROWN IN CONTRA COSTA COUNTY IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN LET ME OPEN. WE SERVED UP ABOUT ELEVEN HUNDRED FAMILIES TWO YEARS LATER IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WE WERE ABLE TO SERVE TWENTY FOUR HUNDRED PACKED FAMILIES EXPERIENCING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SEXUAL ASSAULT CHILD ABUSE ELDER ABUSE AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING. AND ALL OF THESE NUMBERS HAVE GROWN BECAUSE OUR COMMUNITY AWARENESS HAS GONE AND ALSO BECAUSE WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PROVIDE. BUT SERVICES WITHOUT ANY BARRIERS INCLUDING GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION ON THE LANGUAGE IMMIGRATION STATUS NO MATTER WHAT YOUR BACKGROUND IS WE ARE ABLE TO SERVE THIS CLIENTS. AND ALSO WE DO THIS WITH FORTY DIFFERENT PARTNERS THAT INCLUDE FOUR DIFFERENT POLICE AGENCIES. COMMUNITY PARTNERS ADVOCACY GROUPS AS WELL AS WE HAVE A FREE MEDICAL CLINIC PROVIDING FREE MEDICAL CARE. SO IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO PROVIDE COMPREHENSIVE DRAPER OUT SERVICES. AND AS YOU MAY KNOW THAT THE FAMILY JUSTICE MODEL HAS BEEN CONSIDERED A BEST PRACTICE BY THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. AND THERE'S ALSO STATE CALIFORNIA LAW ENABLING LEGISLATION DEFINING THE FAMILY JUSTICE MODEL. AND WE HAVE SEVERAL RESEARCH PAPERS AND REPORTS THAT SHOWED THAT THIS PRODUCT THIS MODEL WITH THE SUCCESSFUL AND THIS IS THE ONE OF THE REPORT THAT I TOO HAVE MY PHOTO. THAT I WOULD JUST BRING THAT. AND THERE ARE TWENTY ONE FAMILY JUSTICE CENTERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THAT. THE NUMBER IS GROWING AND WE ARE SEEING A LOT MORE LOCATIONS AND MORE AREAS WHERE THEY ARE. PLANNING TO OPEN A FAMILY JUSTICE THAT UP BECAUSE THIS ONE STOP MODEL WOULD IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE AND HE'S MAKES SENSE. OKAY. ANYONE IN THE AUDIENCE SEVENTY COMMENTS. CONCERNING THIS. ONE OF THE CHALLENGES I THINK WILL FACE IS THAT WE HAVE A. A NUMBER OF YOU KNOW A REQUEST STRUCTURES THAT PEOPLE TALK ABOUT AND. WITH ITS CAST WITH ITS THIS JUSTICE CENTER WHETHER AT SOME. THE FAMILY. WHAT IS AT THE? END OF THE PROGRAM WE HAD IN LA COUNTY. CHILDREN'S OF IN THE CHILDREN'S ADVOCACY CENTER SO WE HAVE A NUMBER OF. THESE PROGRAMS THAT ARE ALBEIT IT SEEMED TO BE. I DON'T I DON'T THINK THAT MISSION MAYBE OVERLAPPING IN SOMEONE'S TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. HOW THEY'RE ALL RELATED TO EACH OTHER EVERYBODY SEEMS TO NOT? EVERYONE SEEMS TO BE ADDRESSING THE SAME ISSUE WHICH MEANS ISSUES MUST BE VERY VALID NEVER COMMUNITY BUT THE BEST WAY TO TO HANDLE IT AT THIS LEVEL AT THE STATE LEVEL. IN TERMS OF. ANYWAY WE'LL WE'LL THINK ABOUT IT BEST WAY TO HANDLE IT MAY END UP BEING SOME GRANT PROCESS THAT EVERYBODY JUST SUPPLIES TO BECAUSE THEY ALL SEEM TO BE OVERLAP IN WITH THE. SAME ISSUES OF OF OF VIOLENCE AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND SEXUAL ASSAULT AND ALL THOSE KINDS OF THINGS. OF THAT ARE ALL. VERY AND AND SEVERAL AGENCIES ARE DRESSING IT FROM DIFFERENT POINTS OF VIEW. OF SO IT'S GREAT CIPTA AND I'M NOT SURE IF WE WANT TO FUND. EIGHTEEN DIFFERENT WAYS OF DOING THINGS SOMETHING VERY SIMILAR RATHER ESPECIALLY THAT STATE LEVEL WHO WANT SOME ACCOUNTABILITY IN COORDINATION. AND ONE MAKE SURE THAT EVERY AREA IS COVERED IN THE STATE RATHER THAN JUST. INDIVIDUAL AREAS ARE COVERED AND OF THE JUSTICE AND AS YOU HAVE SEVERAL THROUGHOUT THE STATUS ALTHOUGH BUT THAT THE MATERIAL WAS SO. IT'S INTERESTING BUT WILL LOOK AT IT MIA THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU I THINK MR CUNNINGHAM IS HE HERE. OH YES OKAY VARIOUS OPEN. THANK YOU MAY BE OUR LAST PERSON THAT I KNOW OF THAT I STILL MY PIECE OF PAPER. OKAY. AB CROSS THAT EVERYBODY YEAH YOU'RE THE PERSON WAS HERE. ALONE.

MEMBER CAVALERA WAS TALKING ABOUT THE SEVEN DON'T HAVE ANY MONEY IT SO WELL DON'T UNDERSTAND TIME. I LIKE HER FUNDING ABOUT BETTER ACTION THAT I WILL BE BRIEF THOUGH THIS PROGRAM WHICH USED TO BE CALLED THE GRIP PROGRAM CALIFORNIA GET GANG REDUCTION INTERVENTION AND PREVENTION PROGRAM. HAS BEEN RENAMED THE CALVET PROGRAM VIOLENCE INTERVENTION PREVENTION. I UNDERSTAND IN THE LAST BUDGET WAS FUNDED AT NINE POINT TWO MILLION DOLLAR LEVEL. THE I JUST WANNA MAKE THREE IMPORTANT QUICK POINTS ABOUT. THIS PROGRAM FOR ONE THING IT'S IT'S TO PROACTIVE IN NATURE AND IT'S ONE OF THE. ONE OF THE PRECIOUS PROGRAMS WE HAVE IN THE STATE THAT ACTUALLY IS OUT IN THE COMMUNITY IN A PROACTIVE WAY TRYING TO. I'D GET KIDS BEFORE THEY GET TRAPPED IN SITUATION THAT WINDS THEN AND. IT ENDS UP WITH THEM GOING SOMEWHERE THAT ISN'T POSITIVE FOR THEM AND IT HAD INCREDIBLE SUCCESS I'VE GOT. ONE CITY AND MY DISTRICT. CITY NAME MOM POKE. BOB POKE FUN AT A PROGRAM TWENTY FOUR. AT TWENTY FOURTEEN TWENTY FIFTEEN THEY HAD FIFTY KIDS ENROLLED IN THEIR GRIP WHAT USED TO BE THE GRIP FUNDED. A YOUTH CORPS PROGRAM. AND THEY SAW IT MASSIVE DECLINES MASSIVE DECLINES. IN PROBATION REFERRALS BOTH IN ABSOLUTE TERMS AND RELATIVE TO CONTROL GROUP THEY'RE ACTUALLY TRACKING IT. COMPARED TO. GOT A CONTROL GROUP KIDS. WERE TALKING THREE FOUR TIMES THE THE NUMBER OF DECLINE SO WE KNOW THE PROGRAMS EFFECTIVE WE KNOW THAT IT WORKS WE KNOW THAT IT IT. GETS KIDS OPPORTUNITY FOR JOB FOR JOB TRAINING AND SKILLS DEVELOPMENT AS WELL AS RE ENTRY AND OTHER TYPES OF SUPPORT THINGS THAT I THINK IT'S WORTHY OF. CONSIDERATION FOR CONTINUED SUPPORT. CAN I WITH ME TODAY WITH YOUR INDULGENCE IS AT WOULDN'T WEAVER AND MY LEFT. MR WEAVER'S A FRIEND OF MINE HE'S EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF AN ORGANIZATION CALLED FIGHTING BACK SANTA MARIA VALLEY IT'S A NONPROFIT HE STARTED. A TO PROMOTE. HEALTHY AND SAFE ENVIRONMENT FOR KIDS AND ALSO FOR IT'S AN ANTI VIOLENCE PROGRAM HE YOU'D LIKE TO SPEAK FOR A MINUTE IF YOU GUYS ARE THE CHAIR NOTHING. SO WE'RE TRYING TO DO AND LIKE MANY CITIES IS WE'RE TRYING TO GET AHEAD OF. THE VIOLENCE CURVE A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE HEARD FORCE TREATMENT AFTER THE FACT AND WE DON'T REALLY LIKE TO START SPENDING MONEY ON IT BUT I PREVENTION PROGRAM. WE WERE RAVAGED BY. TWENTY ONE. TWENTY ONE MURDERS AND FOURTEEN MONTHS IT WAS EIGHTY PERCENT HIGHER THAN. THE STATE OF THE NATIONAL AVERAGE IN SANTA MARIA. THE FIRST MURDER WAS HAPPY EARLY MON HEAVIER WAS A CLIENT OF MINE WHEN I WAS A CHILD WELFARE CPS I WAS THE SUPERVISOR THERE AT THE TIME. AND. YOU KNOW HOW THEY ARE GOT CAUGHT UP IN THE GANG LIFE HE WAS MOST SUPPLYING HIS OWN HABIT. WITH METHAMPHETAMINES ANY COULDN'T PAY THE BILLS CAN PASS TAXES SO. HE WAS ORDERED MURDERED FROM PRISON BY A LOCAL GANG. AND HIS BODY LEFT OUT AND GUADELOUPEAN THE FARMS. I THINK OF HOW THE AREA. TWO DAYS AGO AS WITH LITTLE YOUNG MAN NAMED THIS TRAIL IS TRAIL.

BUT WE WOULD LIKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO APPLY FOR THE FUNDS TO HELP KIDS LIKE IT'S TRAIL. TO PREVENT HIM IN BECOMING HEAVIER. WE CAN'T DO THAT IF YOU DON'T RELEASE THE FUNDS I AM IT'S A COMPETITIVE PROCESS IT'S EQUITABLE. WE THINK IT'S A GOOD INVESTMENT IT'S NOT A LOT OF MONEY WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE STATE BUDGET. AND IN ALL CITIES ITEM UNFORTUNATE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAVE THIS PROBLEM AND THEY'RE ALL ASKING YOU FOR THE SAME THING WOULD YOU LET US GET AHEAD OF THE CURVE. INSTEAD OF TRYING TO KEEP.

BUT YOUR MONEY GOES A LONG WAY IN A SMALL CITY LIKE SANTA MARIA AND WE DON'T HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE OTHER FLINT PHILANTHROPIC RESOURCES THAT SOME OF OUR LARGER CITIES HAVE.
