ENFORCEMENT HAD NO IDEA THAT

00:47:04.087 --> 00:47:05.489
THIS ACTIVITY WAS GOING ON

00:47:05.556 --> 00:47:09.126
BECAUSE IT WASN'T HAPPENING. IN

00:47:09.193 --> 00:47:10.961
THEIR SPECIFIC AREA- WE WERE

00:47:11.028 --> 00:47:12.796
ABLE TO TAKE DOWN THE

00:47:12.863 --> 00:47:13.864
INVESTIGATION TAKE DOWN THIS

CRIMINAL ORGANIZATION YEAH AND

POINT THAT OUT- JUST AS AN

00:47:33.383 --> 00:47:37.621
EXAMPLE OF HOW THIS ACTIVITY.

00:47:37.688 --> 00:47:39.923

DISCUSSION IS 80% OF IT WAS

00:58:06.683 --> 00:58:08.885
SPENT ON SEX TRAFFICKING. AND

00:58:08.952 --> 00:58:10.553

CRIMINAL LEGAL SYSTEM IN THE

LIVES OF THOSE I SERVE. BUT I'VE

01:07:21.604 --> 01:07:23.873
ALSO EXPERIENCED THAT FIRST HAND

01:07:23.939 --> 01:07:25.174
. I HAVE SHARED MY EXPERIENCE

CALLED HUMAN TRAFFICKING. MOST

01:07:35.551 --> 01:07:37.520
STORIES INVOLVE BEING ABUSED OR

01:07:37.586 --> 01:07:40.322
NEGLECTED AS A CHILD. AND

01:07:40.389 --> 01:07:40.890
NAVIGATING THROUGH THE CHILD

01:07:40.956 --> 01:07:43.492
WELFARE SYSTEM. MY JOURNEY DOES

01:07:43.559 --> 01:07:46.962
NOT START THAT WAY. I GREW UP

01:07:47.029 --> 01:07:48.898
WITH BOTH OF MY PARENTS IN THE

01:07:48.964 --> 01:07:50.933
SAME HOUSEHOLD. IT WAS A HOME

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:52.902
FILLED WITH LOVE AND HAPPINESS

01:07:52.968 --> 01:07:54.870
BUT IT WAS ALSO A HOME THAT

01:07:54.937 --> 01:07:58.207
EXPERIENCE CONFLICT. PAIN AND

01:07:58.274 --> 01:07:59.508
THE CHALLENGES THAT OFTEN

01:07:59.575 --> 01:08:02.278
ACCOMPANY LIFE. I WASN'T ABUSED

01:08:02.344 --> 01:08:05.047
IN MY HOME BUT I FREQUENTLY

01:08:05.114 --> 01:08:06.315
WITNESSED MOMENTS THAT MADE ME

01:08:06.382 --> 01:08:08.284
FEEL LESS TRUSTING AND LESS

01:08:08.350 --> 01:08:10.686
SAFE. WHEN IT CAME TO THOSE

01:08:10.753 --> 01:08:13.155
AROUND ME. THESE MOMENTS ARE

01:08:13.222 --> 01:08:15.090
OFTEN CHARACTERIZED BY COMBAT OF

01:08:15.157 --> 01:08:17.693
ARGUMENTS AND DUE TO THE SYSTEM

01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:19.061
INVOLVEMENT OF SOME OF MY

01:08:19.128 --> 01:08:23.098
SIBLINGS POLICE INTERACTIONS.

01:08:23.165 --> 01:08:24.633
ONE MOMENT IN PARTICULAR THAT

01:08:24.700 --> 01:08:26.836
STANDS OUT THAT NO CHILD SHOULD

01:08:26.902 --> 01:08:29.238
EVER EXPERIENCE AS HAVING LAW

01:08:29.305 --> 01:08:30.739
ENFORCEMENT ARMED WITH ASSAULT

01:08:30.806 --> 01:08:33.476
WEAPONS BURST INTO MY HOME AND

01:08:33.542 --> 01:08:36.979
POINT A GUN AT ME AS IF I WERE A

01:08:37.046 --> 01:08:38.113
THREAT TO PUBLIC SAFETY. I WAS

01:08:38.180 --> 01:08:42.184
ELEVEN YEARS OLD. NO ONE WAS

01:08:42.251 --> 01:08:43.919
ARRESTED THAT DAY AND AFTER

01:08:43.986 --> 01:08:45.488
HAVING TRAUMATIZED EVERYONE

01:08:45.554 --> 01:08:48.491
PRESENT THEY LEFT CALLING IT A

01:08:48.557 --> 01:08:50.960
PROBATION SEARCH. THERE WERE NO

01:08:51.026 --> 01:08:52.895
SUPPORT OF SERVICES OFFERED TO

01:08:52.962 --> 01:08:55.064
ME AFTER THAT. AND I WAS LEFT TO

01:08:55.130 --> 01:08:58.000
FIGURE OUT HOW TO COPE ON MY OWN

01:08:58.067 --> 01:08:59.668
DESPITE THE SYSTEM KNOWING IT

01:08:59.735 --> 01:09:02.037
HAD CONTACTED A MINOR AND SUCH A

01:09:02.104 --> 01:09:06.442
HORRENDOUS WAY. AS ITRANSITION

01:09:06.509 --> 01:09:08.277
FROM CHILDHOOD INTO MY TEENAGE

01:09:08.344 --> 01:09:10.145
YEARS. I BEGAN TO EXPERIENCE

01:09:10.212 --> 01:09:11.380
FEELINGS OF DEPRESSION AND

01:09:11.447 --> 01:09:14.783
ANXIETY. WHEN I WAS SIXTEEN I

01:09:14.850 --> 01:09:16.852
BEGAN TO SELF HARM AS A METHOD

01:09:16.919 --> 01:09:18.754
OF COPING WITH THOSE FEELINGS.

01:09:18.821 --> 01:09:20.322
GIVING ME A SENSE OF POWER AND

01:09:20.389 --> 01:09:22.525
CONTROL BECAUSE I FELT LIKE I

01:09:22.591 --> 01:09:24.827
HAD NONE. I HAD MOVED AWAY FROM

01:09:24.894 --> 01:09:27.796
THE ONLY HOME I'D EVER KNOWN AND

01:09:27.863 --> 01:09:28.931
OFTEN FELT LIKE I JUST DID NOT

01:09:28.998 --> 01:09:32.635
BELONG. WHEN I WAS NINETEEN

01:09:32.701 --> 01:09:34.236
AFTER GETTING MY FIRST BOYFRIEND

01:09:34.303 --> 01:09:35.271
AND FALLING IN LOVE FOR THE

01:09:35.337 --> 01:09:38.841
FIRST TIME. I BECAME PREGNANT.

01:09:38.908 --> 01:09:40.476
THIS WAS ALSO THE SAME AGE I

01:09:40.543 --> 01:09:42.211
EXPERIENCED MY FIRST BREAKUP AND

01:09:42.278 --> 01:09:45.981
HEARTBREAK. I ULTIMATELY MADE

01:09:46.048 --> 01:09:47.917
THE INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT CHOICE

01:09:47.983 --> 01:09:51.053
TO HAVE AN ABORTION. AFTER WHICH

01:09:51.120 --> 01:09:52.955
I FELT INCREDIBLE GUILT AND

01:09:53.022 --> 01:10:04.733
SHAME. I WASN'T PREPARED THE

01:10:04.800 --> 01:10:06.135
MENTAL ANIMAL AND OF THIS. IT

01:10:06.201 --> 01:10:07.169
LEFT ME AND A STATE. BUT STILL

01:10:07.236 --> 01:10:09.371
WAS NO FOLLOW UP CARE BY MY OR

01:10:09.438 --> 01:10:10.439
HEALTH PROVIDERS. DESPITE HAVE A

01:10:10.506 --> 01:10:11.006
HISTORY OF MENTAL HEALTH

01:10:11.073 --> 01:10:12.641
PROBLEMS IN MY FAMILY AS WELL AS

01:10:12.708 --> 01:10:15.644
ADDICTION. ONCE AGAIN I WAS LEFT

01:10:15.711 --> 01:10:17.446
TO COPE ON MY OWN AFTER COMING

01:10:17.513 --> 01:10:20.082
IN CONTACT WITH THE SYSTEM THAT

01:10:20.149 --> 01:10:21.216
IS SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT HELPING

01:10:21.283 --> 01:10:25.454
PEOPLE. NINETEEN WOULD ALSO BE

01:10:25.521 --> 01:10:27.823
THE YEAR I'M INTRODUCED TO THE

01:10:27.890 --> 01:10:30.159
WORLD OF SEXUAL EXPLOITATION. MY

01:10:30.225 --> 01:10:32.127
EXPERIENCE HOWEVER WAS NOT THE

01:10:32.194 --> 01:10:33.896
MAINSTREAM EXPERIENCE OFTEN

01:10:33.963 --> 01:10:36.365
PORTRAYED IN OUR SOCIETY. AT

01:10:36.432 --> 01:10:37.666
THIS TIME IN MY LIFE I WAS

01:10:37.733 --> 01:10:40.869
EXTREMELY DEPRESSED AND LOOKING

01:10:40.936 --> 01:10:42.071
FOR A WAY TO ESCAPE THE REALITY

01:10:42.137 --> 01:10:44.940
OF ME. THE FAST PACED WORLD THAT

01:10:45.007 --> 01:10:46.675
FACILITATED EXPLOITATION GAVE ME

01:10:46.742 --> 01:10:49.645
THAT ESCAPE. IT GAVE ME A RASH

01:10:49.712 --> 01:10:51.814
AND THE SENSE OF BELONGING. THIS

01:10:51.880 --> 01:10:53.782
WORLD GAVE ME OF THE ABILITY TO

01:10:53.849 --> 01:10:56.518
BE SOMEONE NOW. SOMEONE WHO

01:10:56.585 --> 01:10:58.354
DIDN'T REMIND ME OF WHO I USED

01:10:58.420 --> 01:11:01.790
TO BE AND COULD NEVER BE AGAIN.

01:11:01.857 --> 01:11:04.326
FROM NINETEEN TO TWENTY TWO I

01:11:04.393 --> 01:11:05.361
WAS TRAFFICKED AND SEXUALLY

01:11:05.427 --> 01:11:06.695
EXPLOITED BY THREE DIFFERENT

01:11:06.762 --> 01:11:09.765
PEOPLE. EACH PERSON WAS

01:11:09.832 --> 01:11:11.367
DIFFERENT AND EACH RELATIONSHIP

01:11:11.433 --> 01:11:13.802
WAS DIFFERENT. ONE WAS THE

01:11:13.869 --> 01:11:15.871
BUSINESS TYPE ONE WAS THE ROMEO

01:11:15.938 --> 01:11:18.407
TYPE AND THE OTHER WAS MY

01:11:18.474 --> 01:11:21.343
BOYFRIEND. THE LAST EXPERIENCE I

01:11:21.410 --> 01:11:23.646
HAD WAS WITH MY BOYFRIEND. IT

01:11:23.712 --> 01:11:25.681
WAS WITH HIM THAT I HAD THE MOST

01:11:25.748 --> 01:11:28.117
INTENSE RELATIONSHIP OF ALL. IT

01:11:28.183 --> 01:11:30.085
WAS CHARACTERIZED BY VIOLENCE

01:11:30.152 --> 01:11:32.688
GAS LIGHTING AND MANIPULATION

01:11:32.755 --> 01:11:34.657
AND WAS EXTREMELY TOXIC FOR BOTH

01:11:34.723 --> 01:11:39.161
OF US. AFTER A FEW MONTHS WE

01:11:39.228 --> 01:11:40.996
BEGAN USING ALCOHOL AND DRUGS

01:11:41.063 --> 01:11:43.632
MORE FREQUENTLY. WE INSERTED

01:11:43.699 --> 01:11:45.601
OURSELVES BACK INTO THE CULTURE

01:11:45.668 --> 01:11:47.970
OF PARTYING LIKE ROCK STARS AND

01:11:48.037 --> 01:11:49.805
SOON AFTER I FOUND MYSELF

01:11:49.872 --> 01:11:52.041
ENGAGING AND STREET AND ONLINE

01:11:52.107 --> 01:11:54.443
PROSTITUTION. WHEN I WASN'T

01:11:54.510 --> 01:11:56.445
HAVING SEX FOR MONEY I WAS

01:11:56.512 --> 01:11:58.080
COMMITTING PETTY THEFT AT THE

01:11:58.147 --> 01:12:00.315
MALL TO KEEP MONEY COMING IN.

01:12:00.382 --> 01:12:02.718
THIS WAS EXPECTED AS PART OF THE

01:12:02.785 --> 01:12:04.853
LIFESTYLE. IT DIDN'T STOP THERE

01:12:04.920 --> 01:12:07.956
HOWEVER I WAS ALSO ENCOURAGED

01:12:08.023 --> 01:12:09.625
AND SOMETIMES FORCED TO ENGAGE

01:12:09.692 --> 01:12:11.794
IN PHYSICAL ASSAULTS TO OTHERS

01:12:11.860 --> 01:12:13.962
FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS. THIS

01:12:14.029 --> 01:12:15.698
UNFORTUNATELY ALSO MEANT

01:12:15.764 --> 01:12:17.533
PARTICIPATING IN THE TRAFFICKING

01:12:17.599 --> 01:12:21.503
AND EXPLOITATION OF OTHER PEOPLE

01:12:21.570 --> 01:12:23.105
. I WAS TWENTY TWO YEARS OLD

01:12:23.172 --> 01:12:25.407
WHEN I WAS ARRESTED AND CHARGED

01:12:25.474 --> 01:12:27.776
WITH PIMPING PANDERING AND A

01:12:27.843 --> 01:12:29.878
RANGE OF OTHER CHARGES FROM

01:12:29.945 --> 01:12:32.281
ASSAULT TO KIDNAPPING. MY CO

01:12:32.347 --> 01:12:35.217
DEFENDANT WAS ALSO THE PERSON

01:12:35.284 --> 01:12:38.087
WHO TRAFFICKED AND EXPLOITED ME

01:12:38.153 --> 01:12:39.354
. I SPENT TWO YEARS IN THE

01:12:39.421 --> 01:12:40.723
COUNTY JAIL FIGHTING MY CASE

01:12:40.789 --> 01:12:42.558
ANALYTICS ULTIMATELY SENTENCED

01:12:42.624 --> 01:12:44.393
TO STATE PRISON FOR A TERM OF

01:12:44.460 --> 01:12:47.196
FIVE YEARS. I SERVE THE REST OF

01:12:47.262 --> 01:12:48.764
MY TIME UNDER THE CONTROL OF

01:12:48.831 --> 01:12:51.867
CDCR. BEFORE COMING HOME IN

01:12:51.934 --> 01:12:55.771
TWENTY FIFTEEN. THROUGHOUT THE

01:12:55.838 --> 01:12:57.973
ENTIRE TIME I WAS INCARCERATED.

01:12:58.040 --> 01:12:59.274
I WAS NEVER PROVIDED WITH ANY

01:12:59.341 --> 01:13:01.443
SERVICES OR SPACE TO BE ABLE TO

01:13:01.510 --> 01:13:03.545
SELF IDENTIFY AS A TRAFFICKING

01:13:03.612 --> 01:13:05.714
VICTIM DESPITE HAVING COME IN

01:13:05.781 --> 01:13:07.750
CONTACT WITH AN ENTIRE LEGAL

01:13:07.816 --> 01:13:11.653
SYSTEM. INSTEAD I WAS ONCE AGAIN

01:13:11.720 --> 01:13:13.856
LEFT TO SILENTLY COPE WITH WHAT

01:13:13.922 --> 01:13:16.859
I HAD EXPERIENCED. THE SYSTEM

01:13:16.925 --> 01:13:19.294
NEVER SAW ME AS A VICTIM. THIS

01:13:19.361 --> 01:13:21.864
WAS EVIDENT AND ONE OF MY VERY

01:13:21.930 --> 01:13:24.133
FIRST ENCOUNTERS WITH CDC ARE.

01:13:24.199 --> 01:13:25.400
IN A COMMITTEE HEARING WHEN

01:13:25.467 --> 01:13:27.836
BEING ASSIGNED TO A PRISON LABOR

01:13:27.903 --> 01:13:28.937
ASSIGNMENT I WAS ASKED BY

01:13:29.004 --> 01:13:31.406
LIEUTENANT WHY I HAD DONE WHAT

01:13:31.473 --> 01:13:34.143
I'VE DONE. I SIMPLY TOLD HIM I

01:13:34.209 --> 01:13:36.345
WAS TRYING TO SURVIVE. THAT IF I

01:13:36.411 --> 01:13:38.514
DIDN'T DO WHAT WAS ASKED THE

01:13:38.580 --> 01:13:41.016
CONSEQUENCES WOULD BE WORSE. AND

01:13:41.083 --> 01:13:43.118
NOT SO MANY WORDS HE TOLD ME

01:13:43.185 --> 01:13:44.520
THAT MY ACTIONS DIDN'T MAKE ANY

01:13:44.586 --> 01:13:46.855
SENSE. BECAUSE LOOK WHERE IT GOT

01:13:46.922 --> 01:13:50.058
ME. THEY LOOKED AT ME WITH

01:13:50.125 --> 01:13:52.594
DISGUST AND SHAME. AND I LEFT

01:13:52.661 --> 01:13:55.597
THAT ROOM FEELING LIKE THE WORST

01:13:55.664 --> 01:13:59.067
PERSON ON THE PLANET. PRESENT

01:13:59.134 --> 01:14:00.869
ITSELF IS SEXUALLY VIOLENT IN

01:14:00.936 --> 01:14:04.173
NATURE DEHUMANIZING AND

01:14:04.239 --> 01:14:06.141
INCONSIDERATE OF THE EXPERIENCES

01:14:06.208 --> 01:14:08.243
TRAFFICKING AND SEXUAL ABUSE

01:14:08.310 --> 01:14:10.212
SURVIVORS HAVE GONE THROUGH. I

01:14:10.279 --> 01:14:13.348
HAVE BEEN FORCED BY THE SYSTEM

01:14:13.415 --> 01:14:15.083
JUST STRIPPED COMPLETELY NAKED

01:14:15.150 --> 01:14:16.819
WHILE SOMEONE I DID NOT KNOW

01:14:16.885 --> 01:14:19.555
INSPECTED MY BODY AND THE MOST

01:14:19.621 --> 01:14:21.857
DEHUMANIZING WAY POSSIBLE. THIS

01:14:21.924 --> 01:14:24.092
WAS MY EXPERIENCE AS A SEXUAL

01:14:24.159 --> 01:14:25.661
ASSAULT AND TRAFFICKING SURVIVOR

01:14:25.727 --> 01:14:29.431
IN PRISON. FOR TOO LONG OUR

01:14:29.498 --> 01:14:31.200
COUNTRY HAS OPERATED IN A WAY

01:14:31.266 --> 01:14:32.568
THAT SAYS ACCOUNTABILITY EQUALS

01:14:32.634 --> 01:14:34.803
PRISON. AT PRESENT AS A

01:14:34.870 --> 01:14:35.971
DEHUMANIZING SYSTEM OF

01:14:36.038 --> 01:14:37.873
PUNISHMENT AND REVENGE AND IT

01:14:37.940 --> 01:14:40.742
DOES NOT FOSTER ACCOUNTABILITY

01:14:40.809 --> 01:14:42.778
OR HEALING FOR ANYONE INVOLVED.

01:14:42.845 --> 01:14:44.746
DESPITE BEING TRAFFICKED AND

01:14:44.813 --> 01:14:46.882
SEXUALLY ABUSED AND EXPLOITED. I

01:14:46.949 --> 01:14:48.517
HAVE SERVED MY TIME AND DONE

01:14:48.584 --> 01:14:50.219
TREMENDOUS WORK TO BE

01:14:50.285 --> 01:14:51.019
ACCOUNTABLE FROM MY PAST

01:14:51.086 --> 01:14:54.590
ACTIONS. BUT THE STATE HAS NOT

01:14:54.656 --> 01:15:00.395
BEEN ACCOUNTABLE TO ME. FOR THE

01:15:00.462 --> 01:15:02.331
LAST SEVEN YEARS SINCE COMING

01:15:02.397 --> 01:15:04.166
HOME I HAVE WORKED TO NOT ONLY

01:15:04.233 --> 01:15:05.534
UNDERSTAND WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO

01:15:05.601 --> 01:15:08.270
ME BUT TO ALSO MAKE SURE DOESN'T

01:15:08.337 --> 01:15:10.205
CONTINUE TO HAPPEN TO OTHERS. SO

01:15:10.272 --> 01:15:11.773
MUCH PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE WHEN

01:15:11.840 --> 01:15:13.008
IT COMES TO THE ACCESS THAT

01:15:13.075 --> 01:15:15.043
SURVIVORS HAVE. WHEN IT COMES TO

01:15:15.110 --> 01:15:17.246
JUSTICE. BUT UNFORTUNATELY THIS

01:15:17.312 --> 01:15:19.147
THE STATE HAS DECIDED TIME AND

01:15:19.214 --> 01:15:21.516
TIME AGAIN. THAT ACCESS DOES NOT

01:15:21.583 --> 01:15:25.454
APPLY TO ME OR OTHERS LIKE ME.

01:15:25.520 --> 01:15:26.355
BECAUSE OF MY PREVIOUS

01:15:26.421 --> 01:15:29.224
CONVICTION I AM AN ELIGIBLE FOR

01:15:29.291 --> 01:15:30.559
RECORD EXPUNGEMENT OR VACATE A

01:15:30.626 --> 01:15:34.930
RELEASE. SO WHILE THE STATE

01:15:34.997 --> 01:15:39.334
CONTINUES TO RECOGNIZE. AND PASS

01:15:39.401 --> 01:15:41.303
LEGISLATION THAT RECOGNIZES

01:15:41.370 --> 01:15:43.205
HUMAN TRAFFICKING VICTIMS ARE AT

01:15:43.272 --> 01:15:45.274
TIMES FORCED INTO OTHER ACTS OF

01:15:45.340 --> 01:15:47.843
CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR IT CONTINUES

01:15:47.910 --> 01:15:50.479
TO LEAVE THOSE LIKE ME OUT OF

01:15:50.545 --> 01:15:51.914
THE EQUATION. WHAT THIS

01:15:51.980 --> 01:15:54.182
COMMUNICATES TO ME IS THAT ONLY

01:15:54.249 --> 01:15:56.218
SOME SURVIVORS ARE WORTH CARING

01:15:56.285 --> 01:15:59.554
FOR AND OTHERS ARE NOT.

01:15:59.621 --> 01:16:01.323
SURVIVORS DO NOT COME IN A ONE

01:16:01.390 --> 01:16:03.558
SIZE FITS ALL MODEL. WE ARE ALL

01:16:03.625 --> 01:16:05.727
DIFFERENT. WITH DIFFERENT NEEDS

01:16:05.794 --> 01:16:07.529
AT DIFFERENT STAGES OF HEALING

01:16:07.596 --> 01:16:09.831
AND WITH DIFFERENT EXPERIENCES.

01:16:09.898 --> 01:16:10.766
THE APPROACH TO HELPING

01:16:10.832 --> 01:16:13.902
SURVIVORS NEEDS TO ACKNOWLEDGE

01:16:13.969 --> 01:16:14.903
AND HOLD SPACE FOR THOSE

01:16:14.970 --> 01:16:16.972
DIFFERENCES. WHAT MADE ME

01:16:17.039 --> 01:16:18.674
VULNERABLE TO TRAFFICKING WAS

01:16:18.740 --> 01:16:20.275
BEING SYSTEM IMPACTED FROM A

01:16:20.342 --> 01:16:22.711
YOUNG AGE HAVING AN ABORTION

01:16:22.778 --> 01:16:24.813
WITHOUT PROPER MENTAL HEALTH

01:16:24.880 --> 01:16:27.082
CARE IN THE AFTERMATH. IT WAS

01:16:27.149 --> 01:16:29.384
BEING ANGRY AND FEELING A LACK

01:16:29.451 --> 01:16:32.187
OF POWER AND CONTROL. IT WAS THE

01:16:32.254 --> 01:16:34.957
MESSAGES I GOT FROM MUSIC TV

01:16:35.023 --> 01:16:38.126
MOVIES. BUT MOST OF ALL THE

01:16:38.193 --> 01:16:39.561
VULNERABILITY WAS NOT HAVING A

01:16:39.628 --> 01:16:42.164
SPACE TO PROCESS ALL OF THAT IT

01:16:42.230 --> 01:16:43.332
THE THINGS THAT HAVE HAPPENED TO

01:16:43.398 --> 01:16:46.702
ME. WHEN WE HAVE A SYSTEM THAT

01:16:46.768 --> 01:16:48.170
REFUSES TO ACKNOWLEDGE A

01:16:48.236 --> 01:16:49.938
PERSON'S ENTIRE SELF AND THE

01:16:50.005 --> 01:16:51.773
CHALLENGES THEY FACE. WE

01:16:51.840 --> 01:16:53.542
CONTINUE TO SOLVE ONLY HALF THE

01:16:53.608 --> 01:16:56.445
PROBLEM. AND WHETHER INTENDED OR

01:16:56.511 --> 01:16:58.747
NOT. WE CONTINUE TO PERPETUATE

01:16:58.814 --> 01:17:01.550
CYCLES OF HARM. OUR CURRENT

01:17:01.616 --> 01:17:03.251
SYSTEM OPERATESBY LOOKING AT

01:17:03.318 --> 01:17:05.821
WHAT A PERSON IS DYING AND

01:17:05.887 --> 01:17:06.421
DECIDING WHAT PUNISHMENT THEY

01:17:06.488 --> 01:17:09.191
DESERVE. BUT IT DOES NOT ASK THE

01:17:09.257 --> 01:17:10.993
MOST IMPORTANT QUESTION WHICH IS

01:17:11.059 --> 01:17:13.228
WHAT DOES THIS PERSON NEED IN

01:17:13.295 --> 01:17:15.630
ORDER TO NO LONGER CAUSE HARM OR

01:17:15.697 --> 01:17:18.734
EXPERIENCE HARM. THIS IS WHAT IT

01:17:18.800 --> 01:17:20.168
MEANS TO APPROACH THIS ISSUE

01:17:20.235 --> 01:17:21.803
FROM A NON PUNITIVE

01:17:21.870 --> 01:17:24.239
INTERSECTIONAL LENS. THIS

01:17:24.306 --> 01:17:26.775
APPROACH MATTERS TO ME BECAUSE I

01:17:26.842 --> 01:17:27.376
STAND AT THE INTERSECTIONS OF

01:17:27.442 --> 01:17:29.978
LIFE. I AM MADE UP OF MULTIPLE

01:17:30.045 --> 01:17:33.315
EXPERIENCES AND IDENTITIES. I AM

01:17:33.382 --> 01:17:37.819
A DAUGHTER A SISTER AND AUNTS. A

01:17:37.886 --> 01:17:39.855
FORMERLY INCARCERATED SURVIVOR.

01:17:39.921 --> 01:17:42.057
A SURVIVOR OF LIFE. AND A

01:17:42.124 --> 01:17:44.726
SURVIVOR OF THE SYSTEM. IN EACH

01:17:44.793 --> 01:17:47.195
ONE OF THOSE IDENTITIES IS

01:17:47.262 --> 01:17:49.398
EQUALLY AS IMPORTANT AS THE NEXT

01:17:49.464 --> 01:17:50.499
. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME THIS

01:17:50.565 --> 01:17:53.035

01:28:06.614 --> 01:28:08.316
AND MAYBE EVEN I'M USING THE

01:28:08.383 --> 01:28:09.617
TERM UNDERGROUND RAILROAD

01:28:09.684 --> 01:28:11.519
BECAUSE- THAT WAS THE MOST

01:28:11.586 --> 01:28:12.954
EFFECTIVE THING AT THE TIME IT'S

01:28:13.021 --> 01:28:15.623
JUST SOMETHING WE NEED AT THE

01:28:15.690 --> 01:28:18.459
STATE. TO CORRECT THAT KIND OF

01:28:18.526 --> 01:28:20.828
RAILROAD TO GET PEOPLE OUT OF

01:28:20.895 --> 01:28:21.929
THAT THAT SYSTEM DOES THAT MAKE

01:28:21.996 --> 01:28:25.299
ANY. ANY SENSOR HELP. I WAS

01:28:25.366 --> 01:28:27.168
NABBED PANEL ANSWERED IN THE

01:28:27.235 --> 01:28:33.307
SOCIETY IN MISTER BRYANT. ANYONE

01:28:33.374 --> 01:28:35.309
FROM THE PANEL I CAN ANSWER SOME

01:28:35.376 --> 01:28:37.578
OF THE PATTERN SHARE SOME OF MY

01:28:37.645 --> 01:28:41.049
THOUGHTS ON THAT SO- SO I HEAR

01:28:41.115 --> 01:28:43.718
USE USING THE WORDS SLAVERY IN

01:28:43.785 --> 01:28:46.788
TERMS OF WHAT HAPPENED THE THREE

01:28:46.854 --> 01:28:48.389
FOUR HUNDRED YEARS AGO- BUT I

01:28:48.456 --> 01:28:49.991
ALSO WANT TO DRAW A COMPARISON

01:28:50.058 --> 01:28:52.694
TO. OUR OUR PRISON SYSTEM IN THE

01:28:52.760 --> 01:28:54.629
PRISON INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX AND

01:28:54.696 --> 01:28:56.831
THAT AND HOW THAT IS ALSO ROOTED

01:28:56.898 --> 01:29:00.435
IN SLAVERY- AND HOW ME AS A

01:29:00.501 --> 01:29:03.137
SURVIVOR OF EXPLOITATION. BECAME

01:29:03.204 --> 01:29:05.206
THE PROPERTY OF THE STATE. AND

01:29:05.273 --> 01:29:09.077
SO I DEFINITELY UNDERSTAND WHAT

01:29:09.143 --> 01:29:11.112
YOU'RE SAYING- ASSEMBLY MEMBER

01:29:11.179 --> 01:29:13.948
HOWEVER. I DON'T THINK THAT IT'S

01:29:14.015 --> 01:29:17.251
NECESSARILY THE SAME CONTEXT AND

01:29:17.318 --> 01:29:20.455
HERE'S WHY I SAY THAT- MY

01:29:20.521 --> 01:29:22.724
PARTICULAR EXPERIENCE AGAIN WITH

01:29:22.790 --> 01:29:25.593
MY LAST EXPERIENCE WAS WITH MY

01:29:25.660 --> 01:29:26.260
BOYFRIEND THIS WAS SOMEBODY THAT

01:29:26.327 --> 01:29:28.396
I CARED ABOUT. SOMEBODY THAT

01:29:28.463 --> 01:29:29.630
DESPITE EVERYTHING THAT WE HAVE

01:29:29.697 --> 01:29:30.598
BEEN THROUGH EVERYTHING THAT

01:29:30.665 --> 01:29:31.733
HE'S DONE EVERYTHING THAT I'VE

01:29:31.799 --> 01:29:33.768
DONE I STILL CARE ABOUT THIS

01:29:33.835 --> 01:29:36.504
PERSON AS A AS A HUMAN BEING-

01:29:36.571 --> 01:29:39.040
AND SO IT'S NOT AS SIMPLE AS

01:29:39.107 --> 01:29:41.142
GETTING SOMEBODY AWAY FROM THE

01:29:41.209 --> 01:29:43.911
PERSON THE TIMING THEM. BECAUSE

01:29:43.978 --> 01:29:45.346
EVEN THOUGH I WAS SEPARATED FROM

01:29:45.413 --> 01:29:47.982
HIM WHILE INCARCERATED STILL

01:29:48.049 --> 01:29:50.518
VERY MUCH ATTACHED TO HIM- STILL

01:29:50.585 --> 01:29:51.686
VERY MUCH ATTACHED TO THE

01:29:51.753 --> 01:29:54.455
LIFESTYLE OF TRAFFICKING AND-

01:29:54.522 --> 01:29:56.824
SOME OF THE- BENEFITS OF THE

01:29:56.891 --> 01:29:58.659
REWARDS THAT I GOT OUT OF THAT

01:29:58.726 --> 01:30:00.194
WHICH IS A SENSE OF PRIDE A

01:30:00.261 --> 01:30:01.796
SENSE OF POWER AND CONTROL

01:30:01.863 --> 01:30:03.831
EXCEPT FOR US- AND SO I THINK

01:30:03.898 --> 01:30:06.267
THAT THAT THE ANSWER IS NOT.

01:30:06.334 --> 01:30:07.835
JUST GETTING SOMEBODY AWARE

01:30:07.902 --> 01:30:09.437
REMOVED REMOVING THEM FROM AN

01:30:09.504 --> 01:30:11.339
ENVIRONMENT BUT IT'S AGAIN

01:30:11.405 --> 01:30:12.707
REALLY LOOKING AT THE ROOT

01:30:12.774 --> 01:30:15.777
CAUSES OF THE BEHAVIOR ON NOT

01:30:15.843 --> 01:30:18.179
ONLY THE VICTIM OF THE SURVIVORS

01:30:18.246 --> 01:30:20.314
SIDE BUT ALSO ON THE EXPLOITER

01:30:20.381 --> 01:30:22.583
SIDE AS WELL- BECAUSE THERE ARE

01:30:22.650 --> 01:30:24.685
PEOPLE IN A LOT OF THE TIMES. WE

01:30:24.752 --> 01:30:26.454
COME FROM THE SAME COMMUNITIES

01:30:26.521 --> 01:30:27.188
WE COME FROM THE SAME

01:30:27.255 --> 01:30:29.524
NEIGHBORHOODS AND SO THERE'S NOT

01:30:29.590 --> 01:30:32.059
A HUGE POWER IMBALANCE THERE IS

01:30:32.126 --> 01:30:33.427
A GAME WHERE WE BOTH AND POVERTY

01:30:33.494 --> 01:30:36.397
WITH BOTH LACK OF EDUCATION OR

01:30:36.464 --> 01:30:41.235
WHATEVER THAT MIGHT BE- AND SO

01:30:41.302 --> 01:30:42.103
AGAIN I JUST THINK THAT THE

01:30:42.170 --> 01:30:43.437
ANSWER IS IT GETTING TO THE

01:30:43.504 --> 01:30:44.605
ROOT. OF WHY FOLKS. WHAT ARE

01:30:44.672 --> 01:30:46.107
PEOPLE GETTING OUT OF THE

01:30:46.174 --> 01:30:47.775
BEHAVIORS THAT THEY'RE DEALING

01:30:47.842 --> 01:30:48.609
BECAUSE WE'RE ALL GETTING

01:30:48.676 --> 01:30:50.211
SOMETHING OUT OF WHAT WE ENGAGE

01:30:50.278 --> 01:30:52.680
AND ESPECIALLY ON THE- ON THE

01:30:52.747 --> 01:30:53.948
EXPLOITERS SIDE BECAUSE I ALSO

01:30:54.015 --> 01:30:55.917
ENGAGED IN EXPLOITATION ON THAT

01:30:55.983 --> 01:30:58.619
SIDE OF IT- TO WHERE I CONVINCE

01:30:58.686 --> 01:31:01.088
PEOPLE TO. EXPLOIT THEMSELVES OR

01:31:01.155 --> 01:31:04.525
TO- STYLE THEMSELVES AS WELL-

01:31:04.592 --> 01:31:06.394
BUT IT WAS AGAIN I WAS LACKING A

01:31:06.460 --> 01:31:07.695
WHOLE LOT OF THINGS I WAS

01:31:07.762 --> 01:31:09.096
LACKING COPING SKILLS I WAS

01:31:09.163 --> 01:31:10.998
LACKING PEOPLE SKILLS. I WAS

01:31:11.065 --> 01:31:12.633
LACKING RELATIONAL SKILLS THERE

01:31:12.700 --> 01:31:14.368
IS A LOT OF THINGS THAT I WAS

01:31:14.435 --> 01:31:16.204
LACKING ON A BASIC HUMAN LEVEL.

01:31:16.270 --> 01:31:18.840
TO BE ABLE TO RELATE TO ANOTHER

01:31:18.906 --> 01:31:19.674
HUMAN BEING. AND THE WAY THAT

01:31:19.740 --> 01:31:21.509
OUR SOCIETY OPERATES AND SORT

01:31:21.576 --> 01:31:24.545
OF. LIKE RAISES ALL TO BE IS WE

01:31:24.612 --> 01:31:26.814
LEARN TO SEE EACH OTHER AS

01:31:26.881 --> 01:31:29.317
PRODUCTS AND NOT PEOPLE. AND IN

01:31:29.383 --> 01:31:31.619
THAT IS THE ISSUE- A LOT OF THIS

01:31:31.686 --> 01:31:33.621
STUFF IS ROOTED IN CAPITALISM

01:31:33.688 --> 01:31:36.958
AND- THIS PATRIARCHAL IDEAS OF

01:31:37.024 --> 01:31:39.894
POWER AND CONTROL AND WHO. GETS

01:31:39.961 --> 01:31:41.829
TO BE THE BOSS AND WHO DOESN'T-

01:31:41.896 --> 01:31:44.031
AND SO I THINK WE NEED TO ATTACK

01:31:44.098 --> 01:31:46.601
THOSE SPECIFIC SYSTEMS- AND

01:31:46.667 --> 01:31:48.336
REALLY WORK TO DISMANTLE THOSE

01:31:48.402 --> 01:31:50.204
SYSTEMIC HARMS. SO THAT WE DON'T

01:31:50.271 --> 01:31:52.073
CONTINUE TO PERPETUATE CYCLES

01:31:52.139 --> 01:31:54.075
BECAUSE AGAIN WE CAN CONTINUE TO

01:31:54.141 --> 01:31:55.843
INCARCERATE PEOPLE THAT'S NOT

01:31:55.910 --> 01:31:57.845
GOING TO STOP THE PROBLEM. WHAT

01:31:57.912 --> 01:31:59.614
IT'S A HUMAN PROBLEM AT THAT

01:31:59.680 --> 01:32:01.649
PUBLIC HEALTH PROBLEM AND IT

01:32:01.716 --> 01:32:02.650
NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED AT THAT

01:32:02.717 --> 01:32:04.352
WAY. NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED BY

01:32:04.418 --> 01:32:07.488
PROVIDING CARE TO. YOUNG BOYS

01:32:07.555 --> 01:32:10.391
AND YOUNG MEN WHO WE IDENTIFY AS

01:32:10.458 --> 01:32:12.193
HAVING SOME BEHAVIOR ISSUES AND

01:32:12.260 --> 01:32:13.327
WE NEED TO GET TO THE ROOT OF

01:32:13.394 --> 01:32:16.831
THAT. RECOGNIZING YOUNG MEN AND

01:32:16.898 --> 01:32:18.666
WOMEN AND GIRLS AND THE PEOPLE

01:32:18.733 --> 01:32:20.401
OF ALL GENDERS WHO STRUGGLE WITH

01:32:20.468 --> 01:32:21.903
ISSUES OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE OR

01:32:21.969 --> 01:32:23.704
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ISSUES. RIGHT

01:32:23.771 --> 01:32:25.339
BECAUSE THAT CAN ALSO TURN INTO

01:32:25.406 --> 01:32:27.475
AN EXPLOITIVE RELATIONSHIP.

01:32:27.541 --> 01:32:29.677
DEPENDING ON WHAT THE NEED IS-

01:32:29.744 --> 01:32:31.712
AND SO I THINK THOSE ARE SOME OF

01:32:31.779 --> 01:32:33.047
THE THINGS THAT WE NEED TO THINK

01:32:33.114 --> 01:32:34.315
ABOUT WHEN IT COMES TO

01:32:34.382 --> 01:32:35.349
ADDRESSING AND WHERE WE'RE

01:32:35.416 --> 01:32:36.918
PUTTING OUR FUNDING AND THINGS

01:32:36.984 --> 01:32:38.286
LIKE THAT WHEN IT COMES TO

01:32:38.352 --> 01:32:45.493
ADDRESSING THIS ISSUE. THANK YOU. FOR SANTIAGO. FOR THE RECORD

WE'VE USED AND IN THE DOESN'T TO

BE. EVEN A LOT TO GET YOUR- TO.

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.736
WHAT LOOK AT TWENTY I THINK ANY

01:33:34.175 --> 01:33:37.478
BECAUSE I. WE EITHER. SO IT OR

01:33:37.545 --> 01:33:38.412
SUPPORT IT WOULD DOLLARS AND

THEM TO HAVE ANY REAL IMPACT

01:33:42.917 --> 01:33:43.718
RIGHT AT THE BOTTOM LINE. THE

01:33:43.784 --> 01:33:45.052
SECOND THING IS WE'VE GOT TO

01:33:45.119 --> 01:33:45.953

01:35:31.992 --> 01:35:34.862
IT AND I'M WITH YOU ON THAT AB

01:35:34.929 --> 01:35:36.030
BUT THEN HOW DO WE DEAL WITH

01:35:36.097 --> 01:35:37.698
THIS LAST PIECE. BECAUSE

01:35:37.765 --> 01:35:40.000
ULTIMATELY WHAT WE'RE SEEING. IS

01:35:40.067 --> 01:35:41.435
NOT GOING TO STOP UNLESS WE

01:35:41.502 --> 01:35:43.804
TAKE. ALL THE ACTIONS SAID HERE

01:35:43.871 --> 01:35:46.073
AND MANY MORE THIS ONE TO KIND

01:35:46.140 --> 01:35:47.141
OF GET YOUR IN. YOUR IMPROVE THE

01:35:47.208 --> 01:35:48.609
COMMISSION BUT FOR THAT MATTER I

01:35:48.676 --> 01:35:50.144
MEAN IT'S WORTH THE CONVERSATION

01:35:50.211 --> 01:35:52.012
. YEAH I THINK YOU BRING UP A

01:35:52.079 --> 01:35:53.814
REALLY GOOD POINT- AND I JUST

01:35:53.881 --> 01:35:54.815
WANNA MAKE SURE THAT I'M

01:35:54.882 --> 01:35:56.951
UNDERSTANDING YOUR QUESTION IS.

01:35:57.017 --> 01:35:59.253
ARE YOU ASKING SPECIFICALLY ON

01:35:59.320 --> 01:36:01.055
LIKE MY THOUGHTS ON HOW

01:36:01.122 --> 01:36:02.423
PROSECUTION SHOULD WHAT

01:36:02.490 --> 01:36:04.358
PROSECUTION SHOULD LOOK LIKE.

01:36:04.425 --> 01:36:06.927
AND A NON CARCERAL SORT OF

01:36:06.994 --> 01:36:10.164
APPROACH OR- FOR THOSE NOT FOR

01:36:10.231 --> 01:36:11.699
THOSE WHO'VE EXPERIENCED HUMAN

01:36:11.765 --> 01:36:13.434
TRAFFICKING YEAH. BUT JUST ON

01:36:13.501 --> 01:36:15.069
THE OTHER SIDE OF ON THE OTHER

01:36:15.136 --> 01:36:16.070
SIDE AND I'M OUT THERE ENGAGING

01:36:16.137 --> 01:36:17.338
IN THE EXPLOITATION RECKON I'M

01:36:17.404 --> 01:36:19.473
NOT YOU KNOW. EVEN FOCUS ON THE

01:36:19.540 --> 01:36:21.008
QUOTE UNQUOTE BOTTOM LEVEL OF

01:36:21.075 --> 01:36:22.176
TOTAL BUT THAT THERE IS A

01:36:22.243 --> 01:36:24.945
NETWORK THAT THAT NEEDS TO STOP

01:36:25.012 --> 01:36:27.381
OR WE'LL NEVER. MAKE A DRINK

01:36:27.448 --> 01:36:30.818
AND- OR MET NEVER- REALLY FIGHT

01:36:30.885 --> 01:36:33.420
THIS BACK HOLY. YEAH SO I THINK

01:36:33.487 --> 01:36:37.992
THAT. YOU KNOW WHEN IT COMES TO.

01:36:38.058 --> 01:36:40.194
PROSECUTION OR- IN ALL DEALINGS

01:36:40.261 --> 01:36:41.595
THE FOLKS THAT ARE CAUSING THE

01:36:41.662 --> 01:36:45.032
HARM RIGHT- AND I THINK I'M JUST

01:36:45.099 --> 01:36:46.667
GONNA GO BACK TO WHAT I'M SAYING

01:36:46.734 --> 01:36:48.435
ABOUT. SORT OF PREVENTION AND

01:36:48.502 --> 01:36:50.504
MAYBE THIS IS MORE OF AN

01:36:50.571 --> 01:36:52.606
INTERVENTION- BUT THERE SHOULD

01:36:52.673 --> 01:36:54.975
BE. PROGRAMS I'M NOT SAYING THE

01:36:55.042 --> 01:36:57.244
HOLD FOLKS ACCOUNTABLE- BUT WHAT

01:36:57.311 --> 01:36:58.746
I'VE LEARNED THROUGHOUT MY

01:36:58.812 --> 01:37:01.182
JOURNEY AND THE WORK THAT I DO-

01:37:01.248 --> 01:37:02.449
IS THE ACCOUNTABILITY IS A

01:37:02.516 --> 01:37:05.886
PROCESS AND IT'S NOT SO MUCH OF.

01:37:05.953 --> 01:37:08.088
LIKE YOU DID SOMETHING BAD

01:37:08.155 --> 01:37:09.690
HERE'S YOUR PUNISHMENT NOT HOLD

01:37:09.757 --> 01:37:13.594
YOU ACCOUNTABLE RIGHT- YOU HAVE

01:37:13.661 --> 01:37:14.795
TO GET TO A PLACE OF

01:37:14.862 --> 01:37:16.664
ACCOUNTABILITY. WHERE IS YOU

01:37:16.730 --> 01:37:18.165
HAVE TO GET TO A PLACE OF

01:37:18.232 --> 01:37:19.767
UNDERSTANDING THE HARM THAT YOU

01:37:19.833 --> 01:37:21.969
CAUSE. THE HARM THAT THE OTHER

01:37:22.036 --> 01:37:23.904
PERSON EXPERIENCED IN THE IMPACT

01:37:23.971 --> 01:37:25.906
THAT THAT HAD NOT JUST ON THEM.

01:37:25.973 --> 01:37:28.242
BUT ON THE WHOLE COMMUNITY AS

01:37:28.309 --> 01:37:29.543
WELL AS THAT PERSON'S FAMILY AS

01:37:29.610 --> 01:37:31.679
WELL AND SO I THINK THAT IT'S

01:37:31.745 --> 01:37:33.948
STARTING WITH. AGAIN HOLDING

01:37:34.014 --> 01:37:35.649
FOLKS ACCOUNTABLE AND SAYING HEY

01:37:35.716 --> 01:37:37.117
THIS IS THE HARM THAT YOU

01:37:37.184 --> 01:37:37.952
BECAUSE BUT NOW WE'RE GOING TO

01:37:38.018 --> 01:37:39.286
WORK ON YOU. NOW WE'RE GONNA

01:37:39.353 --> 01:37:41.989
WORK ON HELPING YOU GET TO A

01:37:42.056 --> 01:37:43.424
PLACE OF UNDERSTANDING AND

01:37:43.490 --> 01:37:45.426
ACCOUNTABILITY AND MAYBE THAT

01:37:45.492 --> 01:37:46.927
LOOKS LIKE INSTITUTING MORE

01:37:46.994 --> 01:37:50.464
PROGRAMS WITH IN. PRISON UNTIL

01:37:50.531 --> 01:37:53.300
WE GET TO. THE PLACE WHERE WE NO

01:37:53.367 --> 01:37:55.502
LONGER HAVE THE NEED FOR PRISONS

01:37:55.569 --> 01:37:57.538
BUT IN THE MEANTIME I THINK THAT

01:37:57.605 --> 01:37:59.440
HAVING MORE PROGRAMS IN PLACE

01:37:59.506 --> 01:38:01.408
WHERE FOLKS ARE ABLE TO SORT OF

01:38:01.475 --> 01:38:03.777
PROCESS TO THESE HARMFUL.

01:38:03.844 --> 01:38:07.081
IDEOLOGIES AND- IDEOLOGIES THEIR

01:38:07.147 --> 01:38:08.382
MENTALITIES THAT THEY'VE HAD A

01:38:08.449 --> 01:38:10.184
GROWN ACCUSTOMED TO OUR GROWN UP

01:38:10.251 --> 01:38:12.786
WITH AS NORMAL- I THINK THAT

01:38:12.853 --> 01:38:14.021
THAT'S REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT

01:38:14.088 --> 01:38:15.122
AND I THINK THAT THAT IS A

01:38:15.189 --> 01:38:18.626
PIECE. THAT THE OTHER SIDE HAS

01:38:18.692 --> 01:38:21.996
BEEN LACKING- WE LOCK HOLDS UP

01:38:22.062 --> 01:38:23.697
AND WE DON'T ADDRESS ANY OF THAT

01:38:23.764 --> 01:38:26.066
AND AGAIN I'LL USE MY OWN MY OWN

01:38:26.133 --> 01:38:28.035
STORY AS AN EXAMPLE. WHEN I WAS

01:38:28.102 --> 01:38:31.538
INCARCERATED. NO ONE EVER ASKED

01:38:31.605 --> 01:38:33.540
ME ABOUT THE PERSON WHO ARE

01:38:33.607 --> 01:38:35.409
HARMED NO ONE EVER ASKED ME

01:38:35.476 --> 01:38:36.810
ABOUT THE IMPACT THAT THAT MIGHT

01:38:36.877 --> 01:38:39.913
HAVE HAD ON THEM. ON MYSELF

01:38:39.980 --> 01:38:41.782
AGAIN THINGS LIKE THAT WERE NOT

01:38:41.849 --> 01:38:43.917
ADDRESSED AND SO- THERE'S A LOT

01:38:43.984 --> 01:38:45.653
OF FOLKS THAT STAYED ON THE

01:38:45.719 --> 01:38:49.290
INSIDE HAVING NEVER. LEARNED ARE

01:38:49.356 --> 01:38:51.191
GETTING THE OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN

01:38:51.258 --> 01:38:52.459
THESE CONCEPTS UNTIL

01:38:52.526 --> 01:38:54.295
UNDERSTANDING GET TO A PLACE OF

01:38:54.361 --> 01:38:56.363
UNDERSTANDING WHY THEY DID WHAT

01:38:56.430 --> 01:38:58.232
THEY DID- AND I THINK THAT'S A

01:38:58.299 --> 01:38:59.900
PIECE THAT THAT NEEDS TO BE

01:38:59.967 --> 01:39:01.835
INCORPORATED. AND PROSECUTION

01:39:01.902 --> 01:39:03.137
UNTIL WE GET TO A PLACE IN

01:39:03.203 --> 01:39:05.272
SOCIETY WHERE WE NO LONGER HAVE

01:39:05.339 --> 01:39:06.774

BEEN YOU KNOW I CAN TO CAN BE IN

01:41:46.400 --> 01:41:48.469
THE CONNECTION ON THE TOP TO THE

TO THE PEOPLE WHO ARE VICTIMS

01:41:49.136 --> 01:41:55.309
THEM. BUT FOR US. THERE ARE SOME

01:41:55.375 --> 01:41:57.110
THAT HAVE BE MET. WE HAVE TO BE

01:41:57.177 --> 01:41:58.946
ABLE TO DO. SOMEONE'S BEEN A

01:41:59.012 --> 01:42:02.282
HUMAN TRAFFIC. OR SEX. TRADE

01:42:02.349 --> 01:42:04.585
WORK VICTIM. AND SOME OF THE

01:42:04.651 --> 01:42:07.321
CHANNELS THAT HAVE. IN TIME. AND

01:42:07.387 --> 01:42:10.190
GETTING THE DOCUMENT JUST. THAT

01:42:10.257 --> 01:42:15.562
SOME OF THEM LOOKS LIKE- IT'S-

01:42:15.629 --> 01:42:16.563
NOT BEING ABLE TO GET PEOPLE ARE

01:42:16.630 --> 01:42:20.267
TRYING OR VICTIM AS- TO COME.

01:42:20.334 --> 01:42:22.469
WHEN THEY REACH ALREADY SO THAT

01:42:22.536 --> 01:42:23.871
WE GET AIM FOR AND GET THE

01:42:23.937 --> 01:42:26.940
NUMBER OF THEIR ENTIRE TO. OUR

01:42:27.007 --> 01:42:29.476
AND AGAIN THAT'S TIME COMPONENTS

01:42:29.543 --> 01:42:32.913
THAT FOLKS ABOUT. IT'S HARD TO

01:42:32.980 --> 01:42:35.115
FOLLOW UP AND TO DO THAT.

01:42:35.182 --> 01:42:37.384
ANOTHER TO COME THAT IS HAS BEEN

01:42:37.451 --> 01:42:38.552
A CHALLENGE FOR SOME OF OUR COST

01:42:38.619 --> 01:42:41.121
HAS BEEN GETTING DECLARATIONS

01:42:41.188 --> 01:42:43.891
THAT SHOW- THAT THEY WERE IN

01:42:43.957 --> 01:42:47.861
HUMAN TRAFFICKED. EARLY ON IN

01:42:47.928 --> 01:42:49.796
THE M. OF THE PRO SOME THE CHILD

01:42:49.863 --> 01:42:52.966
. WERE TIED TO. NOT BEING ABLE

01:42:53.033 --> 01:42:54.668
TO DELINEATE BETWEEN. HUMAN

01:42:54.735 --> 01:42:57.170
TRAFFICKING AS THE CRIMES VERSUS

01:42:57.237 --> 01:43:00.574
A MOLESTATION. SO WE GET RECORDS

01:43:00.641 --> 01:43:03.911
THAT SHOW- SOMEONE'S APPLYING

01:43:03.977 --> 01:43:06.613

SOME SORT FOR EXAMPLE. THAT

01:43:10.450 --> 01:43:12.452
INDICATES THAT THIS IS A PERSON

01:43:12.519 --> 01:43:14.955
WHO'S HAD A BIG. MOLESTATION

01:43:15.022 --> 01:43:19.860
WELL. IF THE TWO CRIMES ALMOST

01:43:19.927 --> 01:43:21.495
HEINOUS AND BOTH COMPENSABLE

01:43:21.562 --> 01:43:22.930
WORK PROGRAMS THEY'RE

01:43:22.996 --> 01:43:24.798
COMPENSATED DIFFERENTLY BECAUSE

01:43:24.865 --> 01:43:26.233
HUMAN TRAFFICKING HAS THE

01:43:26.300 --> 01:43:30.871
DEPRIVATION OF LIBERTY COMPOUND

01:43:30.938 --> 01:43:32.973
WHERE YOU CAN BE COMPENSATED FOR

01:43:33.040 --> 01:43:35.509
- JUST. AN ABILITY OR CHECK TO

01:43:35.576 --> 01:43:38.045

HIGHEST RATES OF SEX TRAFFICKING

01:48:17.891 --> 01:48:19.826

INNOCENCE LOST INITIATIVE. I

01:48:34.174 --> 01:48:36.543
TURN TO OUR MAIN CONCLUSIONS. IN

01:48:36.610 --> 01:48:38.345
OUR INVESTIGATION WE HEARD

01:48:38.411 --> 01:48:39.646
ENCOURAGING REPORTS OF THESE

01:48:39.713 --> 01:48:40.981
OPERATIONS BECOMING MORE

01:48:41.047 --> 01:48:42.549
EFFECTIVE AND MORE TRAUMA

01:48:42.616 --> 01:48:45.185
INFORMED OVERTIME. HOWEVER THE

01:48:45.252 --> 01:48:46.887
LITERATURE IN INTERVIEWS ALSO

01:48:46.953 --> 01:48:48.688
CONSISTENTLY INDICATED THAT

01:48:48.755 --> 01:48:50.190
THESE RATES ARE NOT THE BEST

01:48:50.257 --> 01:48:51.558
SOLUTIONS TO HELP PEOPLE WHO ARE

01:48:51.625 --> 01:48:53.693
BEING TRAFFICKED AND ALTERNATIVE

01:48:53.760 --> 01:48:55.595
APPROACHES COULD BETTER PROTECT

01:48:55.662 --> 01:48:58.899
VICTIMS STILL TAKE PROSECUTION

01:48:58.965 --> 01:48:59.432
OF TRAFFICKERS AND PREVENT

01:48:59.499 --> 01:49:02.769
TRAFFICKING. THE LITERATURE

01:49:02.836 --> 01:49:03.770
SUGGESTS THAT OPERATIONS

01:49:03.837 --> 01:49:05.472
IDENTIFY A FEW PEOPLE WHO ARE

01:49:05.538 --> 01:49:07.607
BEING TRAFFICKED EMPHASIZING THE

01:49:07.674 --> 01:49:09.609
OPERATIONS PRIMARILY TARGET SEX

01:49:09.676 --> 01:49:11.912
WORK AND TOO OFTEN TREAT VICTIMS

01:49:11.978 --> 01:49:13.847
PARTICULARLY BLACK VICTIMS AS

01:49:13.914 --> 01:49:16.349
CRIMINALS. WE HAVE REPORTS IN

01:49:16.416 --> 01:49:17.484
BOTH OUR INTERVIEWS AND

01:49:17.550 --> 01:49:19.352
LITERATURE THAT SOME OFFICERS TO

01:49:20.620 --> 01:49:21.888
INSUFFICIENT VICTIM

01:49:21.955 --> 01:49:23.790
IDENTIFICATION TRAINING. THE

01:49:23.857 --> 01:49:25.258
LITERATURE ALSO INDICATES THAT

01:49:25.325 --> 01:49:26.259
OPERATIONS ARE SOMETIMES

01:49:26.326 --> 01:49:28.061

01:49:32.933 --> 01:49:34.567
THERE'S FORCE FRAUD AND COERCION

01:49:36.903 --> 01:49:38.204
INTERVIEWS REPORTED THAT AND

01:49:38.271 --> 01:49:40.373
THEIR EXPERIENCE OPERATIONS TEND

01:49:40.440 --> 01:49:41.675
TO IDENTIFY FEW OR NO

01:49:41.741 --> 01:49:43.910

01:49:43.977 --> 01:49:45.545
WITH INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE TO

ARREST TRAFFICKERS AND

01:49:47.480 --> 01:49:49.249
OPERATIONS UNDERMINE REPORT WITH

PEOPLE WHO ARE BEING TRAFFICKED

01:49:50.450 --> 01:49:52.352
IN LINE FOR CEMENT. WHICH TENDS

01:49:52.419 --> 01:49:53.353
TO BE CRUCIAL TO SECURE

01:49:53.420 --> 01:49:55.422
TESTIMONY NECESSARY TO PROSECUTE

01:49:55.488 --> 01:49:57.357

OR IMMEDIATELY AFTER OPERATIONS

01:50:06.366 --> 01:50:08.368
REMAINS UNLIKELY AND I CAN BE

01:50:08.435 --> 01:50:10.670
BECAUSE OF THE ACUTE STRESS OF

01:50:10.737 --> 01:50:11.838
THE SITUATION OR A DISTRUST OF

01:50:11.905 --> 01:50:13.606
LAW ENFORCEMENT FOR PEOPLE WHO

01:50:13.673 --> 01:50:15.041
ARE BEING TRAFFICKED.

01:50:15.108 --> 01:50:16.643
QUESTIONING DURING THIS TIME CAN

01:50:16.710 --> 01:50:20.380
ALSO BE TRAUMATIZING FOR VICTIMS

01:50:20.447 --> 01:50:20.880
IN ADDITION TO APPROVING

CRIMINAL OFFENSES. LOOKING TO

OTHER STATES WE FOUND THAT LAKE

02:21:13.932 --> 02:21:16.734

LEADERSHIP ARE ON TRAFFICKING WE

02:21:39.958 --> 02:21:41.693
RECOMMEND TO PROVIDE STATE

02:21:41.759 --> 02:21:42.827
LEADERSHIP BROWN TRAFFICKING WE

02:21:42.894 --> 02:21:45.196

COORDINATE EFFORTS OF GOVERNMENT

02:21:50.235 --> 02:21:52.604
AGENCIES AND NGOS ARE ON

02:21:52.670 --> 02:21:56.241
FIGHTING ALL FORMS OF HUMAN

02:21:56.307 --> 02:21:58.009
TRAFFICKING. FOR THREE PATIENTS

02:21:58.076 --> 02:21:59.344
SHOULD BE BROADBAND AND INCLUDE

02:21:59.410 --> 02:22:00.845
REPRESENTATIVES OF LAW

02:22:00.912 --> 02:22:02.647

SERVICE AGENCIES ADVOCATES

02:22:06.251 --> 02:22:08.686
SURVIVORS AND OTHERS. THE GOAL

02:22:08.753 --> 02:22:11.723
DISCUSS WE SHOULD BE TO RAISE

02:22:11.789 --> 02:22:12.357
PUBLIC AWARENESS ABOUT

02:22:12.423 --> 02:22:14.559
TRAFFICKING COLLECTING DATA

02:22:14.626 --> 02:22:16.327
ABOUT WHERE AND HOW TRAFFICKING

02:22:16.394 --> 02:22:19.030
OCCURS IN THE STATE. IMPROVE

02:22:19.097 --> 02:22:22.233
TRAINING. DEVELOP STANDARDIZED

02:22:22.300 --> 02:22:26.804

02:22:26.871 --> 02:22:29.741
AND CATALOG AND ASSESS RESOURCES

02:22:29.807 --> 02:22:32.010
THAT ARE AVAILABLE FOR SURVIVORS

02:22:32.076 --> 02:22:34.045
SO THAT THEY ARE EASILY

02:22:34.112 --> 02:22:37.782
ACCESSIBLE. PROBLEM NUMBER TWO

02:22:37.849 --> 02:22:39.684
LABOR TRAFFICKING OFTEN GOES

02:22:39.751 --> 02:22:42.854
UNDETECTED. WE FOUND THAT LABOR

02:22:42.921 --> 02:22:44.355
TRAFFICKING IS OFTEN HARD TO

02:22:44.422 --> 02:22:47.458
IDENTIFY AND THUS FREQUENTLY

02:22:47.525 --> 02:22:50.495
GOES UNDETECTED IT CAN BE HIDDEN

02:22:50.561 --> 02:22:52.897
IN PLAIN SIGHT YOU'VE HEARD OF

02:22:52.964 --> 02:22:54.532
SOME OF THE TESTIMONY EARLIER

02:22:54.599 --> 02:22:56.301
OFTEN WITHIN BUSINESSES OR

02:22:56.367 --> 02:22:58.403
INDUSTRIES THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE

02:22:58.469 --> 02:23:00.338
BE LEGITIMATE BECAUSE THIS

02:23:00.405 --> 02:23:03.841
OCCURS IN ALMOST MANY OF THE

02:23:03.908 --> 02:23:05.209
INDUSTRIES THAT I HAVE NOTED BOB

02:23:05.276 --> 02:23:06.644
. NO WONDER SOME OF THE

02:23:06.711 --> 02:23:09.047
OBSTACLES TO FINDING LABOR

02:23:09.113 --> 02:23:11.416
TRAFFICKING IN CALIFORNIA. OUR

02:23:11.482 --> 02:23:13.451
RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTS SEVERAL

02:23:13.518 --> 02:23:15.887
OBSTACLES THAT MAKE IT DIFFICULT

02:23:15.954 --> 02:23:17.355
TO IDENTIFY LABOR TRAFFICKING

02:23:17.422 --> 02:23:20.491
CASES. A VARIETY OF GOVERNMENT

02:23:20.558 --> 02:23:22.660
OFFICIALS COULD ENCOUNTER LABOR

02:23:22.727 --> 02:23:25.029
TRAFFICKING IN THE COURSE OF

02:23:25.096 --> 02:23:26.831
THEIR DAY TO DAY WORK BURKE BUT

02:23:26.898 --> 02:23:30.034
NO STATE AGENCY HAS A MANDATE TO

02:23:30.101 --> 02:23:32.236
ACTUALLY LOOK FOR LABOR

02:23:32.303 --> 02:23:34.005
TRAFFICKING. TO LOOK FOR

02:23:34.072 --> 02:23:35.807
SPECIFIC INDICATORS OF

02:23:35.873 --> 02:23:38.309
TRAFFICKING. INVESTIGATORS OFTEN

02:23:38.376 --> 02:23:40.411
STUMBLE ACROSS THE EVIDENCE BUT

02:23:40.478 --> 02:23:42.313
THEY ARE NOT PROACTIVE IN

02:23:42.380 --> 02:23:44.882
LOOKING FOR IT. MOST GOVERNMENT

02:23:44.949 --> 02:23:47.352
OFFICIALS HAVE NOT RECEIVED ANY

02:23:47.418 --> 02:23:49.554
TO IDENTIFY LABOR TRAFFICKING OR

02:23:49.620 --> 02:23:53.291
HOW TO REPORT ANY FINDINGS.

02:23:53.358 --> 02:23:55.159
PURSUING THESE CASES REQUIRES

02:23:55.226 --> 02:23:57.362
COORDINATION AMONG AGENCIES

02:23:57.428 --> 02:23:59.297
INVOLVED LABOR RIGHTS LAW

02:23:59.364 --> 02:24:01.599
ENFORCEMENT AND MANY OTHER

02:24:01.666 --> 02:24:03.368
GOVERNMENT AGENCIES WHAT

02:24:03.434 --> 02:24:06.137
OFTENTIMES WORK IS DONE IN

02:24:06.204 --> 02:24:08.573
CYCLES OFTEN WITH DISCONNECT

02:24:08.639 --> 02:24:10.508
BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND YOU

02:24:10.575 --> 02:24:14.012
ARE OFFICIALS AS WELL AS OTHER

02:24:14.078 --> 02:24:15.113
STAKEHOLDERS. THE ONLY THE

02:24:15.179 --> 02:24:17.615
DEPARTMENT YOUTH THE REPORT

02:24:17.682 --> 02:24:19.283
ABUSES OFTEN FALLS AND WILL

02:24:19.350 --> 02:24:20.785
NOTABLE WORKERS WHO ARE

02:24:20.852 --> 02:24:22.787
LEGITIMATELY FEARFUL TO REPORT

02:24:22.854 --> 02:24:27.058
ABUSES AND AS A RESULT CASES GO

02:24:27.125 --> 02:24:29.227
UNREPORTED. WHAT ARE SOME OF OUR

02:24:29.293 --> 02:24:30.895
RECOMMENDATIONS TO UNCOVER THIS

02:24:30.962 --> 02:24:33.464
HIDDEN CRIME. WE RECOMMEND

02:24:33.531 --> 02:24:34.599
SEVERAL STEPS FOR THE STATE TO

02:24:34.665 --> 02:24:37.001
INCREASE ITS FIRST ONE COVER

02:24:37.068 --> 02:24:39.170
LABOR TRAFFICKING. CALIFORNIA

02:24:39.237 --> 02:24:41.239
SHOULD TRAIN STATE INVESTIGATORS

02:24:41.305 --> 02:24:43.741
AND OTHER EMPLOYERS WHO INTERACT

02:24:43.808 --> 02:24:45.576
WITH HIGH RISK POPULATIONS TO

02:24:45.643 --> 02:24:47.578
RECOGNIZE THE WARNING SIGNS OF

02:24:47.645 --> 02:24:49.881
LABOR TRAFFICKING AND RESPOND

02:24:49.947 --> 02:24:53.051
APPROPRIATELY. WE MUST RAPIDLY

02:24:53.117 --> 02:24:55.286
USE DATA AND TECHNOLOGY TO

02:24:55.353 --> 02:24:57.321
SEARCH FOR ANOMALIES THAT MIGHT

02:24:57.388 --> 02:24:59.090
SUGGEST THE PRESENCE OF LABOR

02:24:59.157 --> 02:25:00.658
TRAFFICKING IN CERTAIN

02:25:00.725 --> 02:25:02.827
BUSINESSES INDUSTRIES OR

02:25:02.894 --> 02:25:04.996
REGIONS. WE SHOULD INCREASE

02:25:05.063 --> 02:25:07.098
AWARENESS OF ALL FORMS OF HUMAN

02:25:07.165 --> 02:25:08.633
TRAFFICKING THROUGH PUBLIC

02:25:08.699 --> 02:25:12.837
AWARENESS AND OUTREACH CAMPAIGNS

02:25:12.904 --> 02:25:14.138
. PROBLEM NUMBER THREE ARE

02:25:14.205 --> 02:25:15.873
VARIOUS BARRIERS THAT MAKE IT

02:25:15.940 --> 02:25:17.508
DIFFICULT FOR SURVIVORS THE AXIS

02:25:17.575 --> 02:25:21.312
HELP. WHEN I HAD A NUMBER OF

02:25:21.379 --> 02:25:23.314
CHALLENGES THAT MAKE IT

02:25:23.381 --> 02:25:26.284
DIFFICULT FOR SUCH SURVIVORS TO

02:25:26.350 --> 02:25:27.885
GET THE HELP THAT THEY NEED.

02:25:27.952 --> 02:25:29.720
WHAT ARE SOME OF THOSE.

02:25:29.787 --> 02:25:31.622
SURVIVORS NEED A RANGE OF

02:25:31.689 --> 02:25:32.890
SUPPORTS BUT WE DON'T KNOW

02:25:32.957 --> 02:25:34.792
ENOUGH ABOUT THE SPECIFIC NEEDS

02:25:34.859 --> 02:25:36.727
OF LABOR TRAFFICKING SURVIVORS

02:25:36.794 --> 02:25:38.162
TO SAY WHICH PROGRAMS ARE MOST

02:25:38.229 --> 02:25:40.231
EFFECTIVE AND HOW THEIR BEST

02:25:40.298 --> 02:25:42.733
DELIVERED. ADDITIONALLY

02:25:42.800 --> 02:25:45.002
SURVIVORS QUALIFY FOR VARIOUS

02:25:45.069 --> 02:25:47.805
PROGRAMS AND SERVICES BUT HELP

02:25:47.872 --> 02:25:50.374
ISN'T ALWAYS EASY TO FIND THERE

02:25:50.441 --> 02:25:52.443
IS NO ONE STOP SHOP TO FIND

02:25:52.510 --> 02:25:56.414
INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT IS

02:25:56.481 --> 02:25:58.616
AVAILABLE STATEWIDE. FOR THIS

02:25:58.683 --> 02:26:00.651
WE'D LIKE TO RECOMMEND THE

02:26:00.718 --> 02:26:04.288
FOLLOWING. TRACKS SERVICE

UNDERSTAND THE NEEDS AND

02:26:09.727 --> 02:26:12.763
DEMOGRAPHICS OF THIS POPULATION

02:26:12.830 --> 02:26:13.798
. RESEARCH ANYBODY WOULD

02:26:13.865 --> 02:26:16.534
ADVOCACY OF SERVICE PROGRAMS AND

02:26:16.601 --> 02:26:18.870
CREATE A USER FRIENDLY DIRECTORY

02:26:18.936 --> 02:26:21.172
OF ALL RESOURCES FOR TRAFFICKING

02:26:21.239 --> 02:26:24.642
SURVIVORS TO MAKE IT EASIER TO

02:26:24.709 --> 02:26:29.180
FIND HELP. LASTLY WE FOUND THE

02:26:29.247 --> 02:26:31.782
PROSECUTION'S FOR LABOR

02:26:31.849 --> 02:26:33.851
TRAFFICKING ARE RARE WE KNOW

02:26:33.918 --> 02:26:35.553
THAT AT THE VERY LEAST HUNDREDS

02:26:35.620 --> 02:26:37.421

SEEK HELP OUR NEWLY IN

02:26:39.056 --> 02:26:41.492
CALIFORNIA BUT ON AVERAGE THERE

02:26:41.559 --> 02:26:43.895
ARE LESS THAN THIRTY CONVICTIONS

02:26:43.961 --> 02:26:46.564
FOR LABOR TRAFFICKING EACH YEAR.

02:26:46.631 --> 02:26:48.933
IN THE STATE. SO WISELY WE'RE

YOU ASK LABOR TRAFFICKING IS

02:26:53.004 --> 02:26:54.939
DIFFICULT TO PROSECUTE FOR A

02:26:55.006 --> 02:26:56.841
NUMBER OF REASONS. WHY ANY

02:26:56.908 --> 02:26:58.776
SURVIVORS MAY BE RELUCTANT TO

02:26:58.843 --> 02:27:01.145
PARTICIPATE AND PROSECUTIONS FOR

02:27:01.212 --> 02:27:02.713
FEAR ALL BROUGH TRAUMATIZING

02:27:02.780 --> 02:27:05.249
ATION. FOR YOUR OUR OUR DISTRUST

OF LAW ENFORCEMENT OR JUST

02:27:07.351 --> 02:27:11.022
SIMPLY WANTING TO MOVE ON FROM

02:27:11.088 --> 02:27:12.123
THE REVIEWS. THE INVESTIGATIONS

02:27:12.190 --> 02:27:14.158
ARE ESPECIALLY COSTLY TIME

02:27:14.225 --> 02:27:15.893
CONSUMING AND RESOURCE

02:27:15.960 --> 02:27:17.762
INTENSIVE. WE CAN REQUIRE

02:27:17.828 --> 02:27:19.730
INVOLVEMENT OF SPECIALIZED

02:27:19.797 --> 02:27:22.033
INVESTIGATORS. AS WELL AS

02:27:22.099 --> 02:27:25.670
RESEARCHING NEW ERA AREAS OF LAW

02:27:25.736 --> 02:27:27.939
. THE CRIME CAN ALSO OCCUR EVEN

02:27:28.005 --> 02:27:29.574
WHEN THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF

02:27:29.640 --> 02:27:31.475
PHYSICAL FORCE OR VIOLENCE

02:27:31.542 --> 02:27:33.444
MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO PROVE IN

02:27:33.511 --> 02:27:36.914
COURT. WE DON'T USE SEVEN

02:27:36.981 --> 02:27:38.316

ACTION TO GO AFTER TRAFFICKERS.

02:28:00.871 --> 02:28:02.940
THIS IS VERY NOBODY WORK BUT AT

02:28:03.007 --> 02:28:04.308
THE STATE WE DON'T TRACK WITH

02:28:04.375 --> 02:28:06.777
AND WE HAVEN'T EXPLORED THIS

02:28:06.844 --> 02:28:09.313
WIDELY ENOUGH. THE STATE ALSO

02:28:09.380 --> 02:28:10.982
LACKS RESOURCES LIKE PUBLISHED

02:28:11.048 --> 02:28:12.650

STATE LAWS TO GO AFTER SEX

02:28:22.526 --> 02:28:24.996
TRAFFICKING CASES THERE IS NO

CLARITY IN RESOURCES FOR LABOR

02:28:28.699 --> 02:28:30.101
TRAFFICKING CASES. WE DON'T HAVE

02:28:42.179 --> 02:28:43.914
OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS TO BRING

02:28:43.981 --> 02:28:46.517

EXPLOITATION WITH SYSTEMS THAT

02:30:46.637 --> 02:30:47.972
ARE ROOTED IN HARM AND

02:30:48.038 --> 02:30:49.340
EXPLOITATION MIGHT ALSO BE

02:30:49.407 --> 02:30:51.409
COUNTER TO THE BROADER GOALS. A

02:30:51.475 --> 02:30:53.511

STATE HAS PERSONALLY FAILED YOU

02:30:58.215 --> 02:31:00.184
AND I APOLOGIZE. FOR THOSE

02:31:00.251 --> 02:31:02.186
BETWEEN YOUR TESTIMONY AND THE

02:31:02.253 --> 02:31:03.754
TESTIMONY FROM THE VICTIMS

02:31:03.821 --> 02:31:04.755
COMPENSATION FUND I THINK

02:31:04.822 --> 02:31:06.657
THERE'S A LOT OF WORK. THAT WE

02:31:06.724 --> 02:31:07.758
CAN DO I'M SHOCKED I DON'T KNOW

02:31:07.825 --> 02:31:09.493
ABOUT THE REST THE COMMITTEE TO

02:31:09.560 --> 02:31:10.227
HEAR THAT ONLY FOUR HUNDRED AND

02:31:10.294 --> 02:31:12.830
FIFTY APPLICANTS. HAVE APPLIED

02:31:12.897 --> 02:31:13.397
TO THE VICTIMS COMPENSATION

02:31:13.464 --> 02:31:15.065
FUND- AND THAT THERE'S THIS

02:31:15.132 --> 02:31:17.234
MISMATCH BETWEEN TRAFFICKING AND

02:31:17.301 --> 02:31:18.469
OTHER DEFINITIONS AND POLICE

02:31:18.536 --> 02:31:20.504
REPORT I THINK IT'S SOMETHING WE

02:31:20.571 --> 02:31:21.105
NEED TO LOOK AT HIM PROBABLY

02:31:21.172 --> 02:31:23.607
LOOK AT URGENTLY- AND SO MY-

02:31:23.674 --> 02:31:25.309
QUESTION IS LESS OF A QUESTION.

02:31:25.376 --> 02:31:27.011
AND MORE OF A COMMENT OF

02:31:27.077 --> 02:31:30.381

QUESTION WAS FOR ME. YES MISTER

02:31:36.454 --> 02:31:39.356
CHAIR SO WE HEARD OUTSTANDING-

02:31:39.423 --> 02:31:40.925
TESTIMONY BOTH FROM THE

02:31:40.991 --> 02:31:43.093
GENTLEMAN HERE AND FROM THIS

02:31:43.160 --> 02:31:45.362
BOOZER AND OTHERS ON LABOR

02:31:45.429 --> 02:31:49.099
TRAFFICKING. AS I SAID IT'S 80%

02:31:49.166 --> 02:31:50.768
ROUGHLY NOBODY REALLY KNOWS AN

02:31:50.835 --> 02:31:53.537
EXACT NUMBER BUT IT'S 80% OF THE

02:31:53.604 --> 02:31:56.173
PROBLEM. NOT THE MOST AMUSING DE

02:31:56.240 --> 02:31:58.342
UNIONIZING PART BUT CERTAINLY A

02:31:58.409 --> 02:32:01.479
VERY LARGE PART. AND MY QUESTION

02:32:01.545 --> 02:32:03.414
FOR YOU AND COMMITTEE STAFF IS

02:32:03.481 --> 02:32:05.149
OF THE VARIOUS RECOMMENDATIONS

02:32:05.216 --> 02:32:08.219
THAT WERE GETTING. WHICH OF THEM

02:32:08.285 --> 02:32:11.489
ARE BUDGET AT WHICH OF THEM ARE

02:32:11.555 --> 02:32:12.990
WOULD BE BEST SOLVED BY A BUDGET

02:32:13.057 --> 02:32:15.793
ASK. WHICH WOULD BE BEST SOLVED

02:32:15.860 --> 02:32:18.329
BY LEGISLATION. WHICH WOULD BE

02:32:18.395 --> 02:32:19.396
BEST SOLVED BY THE

02:32:19.463 --> 02:32:20.931
ADMINISTRATION TAKING A

02:32:20.998 --> 02:32:23.467
DIFFERENT APPROACH. ALL ON THE

02:32:23.534 --> 02:32:25.836
ADMINISTRATION SIDE- WE COULD

02:32:25.903 --> 02:32:28.873
CERTAINLY PASS A RESOLUTION

02:32:28.939 --> 02:32:30.774
ASKING THEM TO DO SOMETHING OF

02:32:30.841 --> 02:32:32.810
COURSE LEGISLATION I WOULD BE

02:32:32.877 --> 02:32:35.179
GLAD CO AUTHOR AUTHOR. AND

02:32:35.246 --> 02:32:37.181
PERHAPS WE AS A GROUP COULD GET

02:32:37.248 --> 02:32:39.116
TOGETHER WITH BUDGET SUB FIVE

02:32:39.183 --> 02:32:42.586
THE GROUP THAT WORKS WITH LAW

02:32:42.653 --> 02:32:44.455
ENFORCEMENT ALTHOUGH. IT'S THE

02:32:44.522 --> 02:32:45.656
DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL

02:32:45.723 --> 02:32:48.025
RELATIONS PERHAPS. BEST TO GET

02:32:48.092 --> 02:32:49.226
AWAY FROM BUDGET SUB FIVE AND

02:32:49.293 --> 02:32:51.395
WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF

02:32:51.462 --> 02:32:54.131
INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS. ON THIS

02:32:54.198 --> 02:32:56.567
LABOR TRAFFICKING ISSUE WHICH IS

02:32:56.634 --> 02:32:59.003
A MUCH HARDER PROBLEM. AND MUCH

02:32:59.069 --> 02:33:00.437
WERE WE HAVEN'T PUT THE

02:33:00.504 --> 02:33:03.007
RESOURCES IN BOTH WHICH IS

02:33:03.073 --> 02:33:06.176
CAUSING SO MUCH PAIN. SO THAT IS

02:33:06.243 --> 02:33:08.345
MY QUESTION TO YOU MISTER CHAIR

02:33:08.412 --> 02:33:11.282
AND TO YOUR STAFF. AND PERHAPS

02:33:11.348 --> 02:33:13.751
IF YOU COULD GET BACK TO- IF

02:33:13.817 --> 02:33:15.452
YOU'RE WILLING TO GET BACK TO

02:33:15.519 --> 02:33:17.421
OUR COMMITTEE MEMBERS. AND TALK

02:33:17.488 --> 02:33:19.490
ABOUT NEXT STEPS I THINK IT'S

02:33:19.557 --> 02:33:21.692
SOMETHING WE'RE ALL OF US. ARE

02:33:21.759 --> 02:33:24.628
COULD GET TOGETHER AND PROVIDE A

02:33:24.695 --> 02:33:27.231
CAT PATH FORWARD BECAUSE OF THE

02:33:27.298 --> 02:33:30.801
GREAT. VALUE THAT WE'VE HEARD

02:33:30.868 --> 02:33:34.538
TODAY YES- IN A IN A REASON WE

02:33:34.605 --> 02:33:36.340
HAVE THESE HEARINGS IS SO THAT

02:33:36.407 --> 02:33:38.208
WE CAN LEARN MORE A GUY THE FOR

02:33:38.275 --> 02:33:42.046
ME- I DIDN'T KNOW HOW SERIOUS

02:33:42.112 --> 02:33:44.782
THE PROBLEM OF LABOR.

02:33:44.848 --> 02:33:48.085
TRAFFICKING WHAT. IS RIGHT NOW

02:33:48.152 --> 02:33:50.988
AND SO- OBVIOUSLY WE NEED TO

02:33:51.055 --> 02:33:52.690
WE'VE SEEN SOME BILLS I THINK

02:33:52.756 --> 02:33:54.391
SOME FROM LORETTA GONZALEZ WHO

02:33:54.458 --> 02:33:56.026
WAS A FORMER COLLEAGUE OF OURS.

02:33:56.093 --> 02:33:58.862
PACIFIC WE NEED TO STEP UP. WHAT

02:33:58.929 --> 02:34:00.731
WE'VE BEEN DOING IN THE PAST. I

02:34:00.798 --> 02:34:02.533
THINK WE ALSO NEED TO DO ON ALL

02:34:02.600 --> 02:34:04.468
THREE LEVELS IN A STRAIGHT OF.

02:34:04.535 --> 02:34:07.338
LEGISLATION AND BUDGET- ONE

02:34:07.404 --> 02:34:08.606
WORKING WITH ADMINISTRATION SO

02:34:08.672 --> 02:34:10.207
THEY CAN TIGHTEN UP THE

02:34:10.274 --> 02:34:11.442
EFFICIENCY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF

02:34:11.508 --> 02:34:13.844
THE- THE OPERATING ORGANIZATION

02:34:13.911 --> 02:34:15.779
THAT'S IN PLACE RIGHT NOW. SO WE

02:34:15.846 --> 02:34:17.281
CAN DO A BETTER JOB WHILE

02:34:17.348 --> 02:34:19.149
WORKING WITH INDIVIDUALS. AND

02:34:19.216 --> 02:34:20.417
I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE

02:34:20.484 --> 02:34:22.753
YESTERDAY WAS BUDGET SUB FIVE.

02:34:22.820 --> 02:34:24.855
AND WE TALKED ABOUT THE VICTIMS

02:34:24.922 --> 02:34:26.256
COMPENSATION BOARD. AND I

02:34:26.323 --> 02:34:30.661
MENTIONED- ABOUT VICTIMS PEOPLE

02:34:30.728 --> 02:34:31.662
WHO ARE VICTIMS OF LAW

02:34:31.729 --> 02:34:35.666
ENFORCEMENT. AND WHETHER OR NOT-

02:34:35.733 --> 02:34:37.434
LIKE THE END INDIVIDUAL THAT WAS

02:34:37.501 --> 02:34:38.802
ON A NO KNOCK WARRANT THAT WAS

02:34:38.869 --> 02:34:41.105
KILLED BY POLICE EVEN THOUGH HE

02:34:41.171 --> 02:34:43.607
WENT TO THE PERSON THEY WERE

02:34:43.674 --> 02:34:45.242
LOOKING FOR HE DIED AS A RESULT

02:34:45.309 --> 02:34:48.012
OF. WELL ACCORDING TO THE- HE

02:34:48.078 --> 02:34:50.648
WOULD NOT BE. HE OR HIS FAMILY

02:34:50.714 --> 02:34:53.851
WOULD NOT BE. ELIGIBLE TO

02:34:53.917 --> 02:34:55.886
RECEIVE VICTIMS COMPENSATION

02:34:55.953 --> 02:34:58.455
BECAUSE THEY WOULDN'T CATEGORIZE

02:34:58.522 --> 02:35:01.225
THAT AS THE CRIME. WE MAY THINK

02:35:01.291 --> 02:35:02.993
OR I MAY THINK IT WAS A CRIME

02:35:03.060 --> 02:35:04.795
THAT THAT HAPPENED BUT SINCE

02:35:04.862 --> 02:35:06.797
IT'S NOT A CRIME IN SOME WAYS

02:35:06.864 --> 02:35:09.667
IT'S A CASUALTY OF WAR CAVITY

02:35:09.733 --> 02:35:11.335
THAT HAPPEN IS A MISTAKE SAID

02:35:11.402 --> 02:35:13.137
UNFORTUNATE ACCIDENT AND ALL OF

02:35:13.203 --> 02:35:15.139
THAT. BUT THAT FAMILY COULDN'T

02:35:15.205 --> 02:35:16.807
GET FUNERAL EXPENSES PAID THEY

02:35:16.874 --> 02:35:19.009
COULD GET A MENTAL HEALTH

02:35:19.076 --> 02:35:20.844
BECAUSE IT IS NOT CTEGORIZED AS

02:35:20.911 --> 02:35:23.380
A CRIME AND SO WE PROBABLY NEED

02:35:23.447 --> 02:35:25.482
TO LOOK AT LEGISLATION SO THAT

02:35:25.549 --> 02:35:26.750
THE VICTIMS COMPENSATION BOARD

02:35:26.817 --> 02:35:28.686
CAN ADDRESS. OF SOME OF THE

02:35:28.752 --> 02:35:30.087
THINGS YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

02:35:30.154 --> 02:35:32.189
MAYBE FILL THOSE LOOPHOLES AND

02:35:32.256 --> 02:35:33.624
THAT WAS IN BUDGET YESTERDAY

02:35:33.691 --> 02:35:35.592
LITERALLY YESTERDAY WE HAD THAT

02:35:35.659 --> 02:35:37.394
DISCUSSION. AND SO YOU'RE RIGHT

02:35:37.461 --> 02:35:38.896
WE NEED TO BRING THEM BRING

02:35:38.962 --> 02:35:43.100
DEMAND SO IT IS A IT IS A- THREE

02:35:43.167 --> 02:35:46.036
PRONG. EFFORT AND WE NEED IT THE

02:35:46.103 --> 02:35:47.671
OTHER THING WE'VE GOT TO STOP

02:35:47.738 --> 02:35:48.238
WORKING IN SILOS AND START

02:35:48.305 --> 02:35:49.873
TALKING TO EACH OTHER. ON THE

02:35:49.940 --> 02:35:53.143
SAME WAY WITH- MATURING THAT.

02:35:53.210 --> 02:35:55.012
DOJ AND OTHERS WHO ARE

02:35:55.079 --> 02:35:57.414
RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS THAT- IT'S

02:35:57.481 --> 02:35:59.416
NOT JUST LAW ENFORCEMENT IS NOT

02:35:59.483 --> 02:36:01.785
JUST. REHABILITATION AND GETTING

02:36:01.852 --> 02:36:03.187
TO THE ROOT CAUSES OF TRAUMA AND

02:36:03.253 --> 02:36:04.621
EVERYTHING IS NOT JUST THAT IT'S

02:36:04.688 --> 02:36:06.290
NOT JUST MAKING SURE THE

02:36:06.356 --> 02:36:08.659
INFRASTRUCTURE WE CREATE- WILL

02:36:08.726 --> 02:36:10.527
ADDRESS EVERYTHING SO- I. I

02:36:10.594 --> 02:36:12.396
WOULD HAVE THAT'S PART OF WHY WE

02:36:12.463 --> 02:36:14.098
PUT THIS TOGETHER. SO WE COULD

02:36:14.164 --> 02:36:15.899
GET DIRECTION OR AT LEAST HAVE

02:36:15.966 --> 02:36:18.535
AN IDEA OF HOW WE CAN SOLVE THIS

02:36:18.602 --> 02:36:20.037
AT THE END OF THE DAY I'M TIRED

02:36:20.104 --> 02:36:21.438
OF TALKING ABOUT THE PROBLEM. A

02:36:21.505 --> 02:36:23.073
LONG TALK ABOUT SOLUTIONS AND

02:36:23.140 --> 02:36:26.610
FINALLY WORK ON THINGS. THAT WE

02:36:26.677 --> 02:36:27.778
CAN ACTUALLY DO. THANK YOU
