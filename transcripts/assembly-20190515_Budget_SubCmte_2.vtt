THE ALLEY OWES COMMENTS.

00:45:37.968 --> 00:45:39.403
THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL IS A

00:45:39.470 --> 00:45:41.105
LITTLE BIT UNIQUE IN THE SENSE

IDENTIFIED AS AREAS WHERE THE

00:45:49.346 --> 00:45:51.582
ADMINISTRATION -- IN WHICH WE

00:45:51.648 --> 00:45:52.783
COULD REALLY USE SOME ADDITIONAL

00:45:52.850 --> 00:45:54.284
INNOVATIVE EDUCATIONAL

00:45:54.351 --> 00:45:57.788
STRATEGIES. ONE WAY IN WHICH

THIS PROPOSAL IS SOMEWHAT UNIQUE

00:45:59.323 --> 00:46:00.591
AS WELL IS THAT IT'S REALLY

00:46:00.657 --> 00:46:01.892
STIMULATING.

00:46:01.959 --> 00:46:03.660
INNOVATIVE IDEAS IN THESE

00:46:03.727 --> 00:46:07.898
PARTICULAR AREAS BOTH OF THE K.

ACHIEVEMENT GAPS AND CREATING A

00:46:14.505 --> 00:46:15.672

THOSE ARE CHALLENGING ISSUES

00:46:19.710 --> 00:46:21.845
THAT NECESSITATE A MULTI FACETED

00:46:21.912 --> 00:46:23.480
APPROACH SO WE DON'T SEE THE

00:46:23.547 --> 00:46:24.615
ADDITIONAL PROPOSAL IS

00:46:24.681 --> 00:46:26.350
NECESSARILY BEING DUPLICATIVE OR

00:46:26.416 --> 00:46:27.684
IN CONFLICT WITH THE OTHER

00:46:27.751 --> 00:46:29.319
EXISTING APPROACHES.

00:46:29.386 --> 00:46:30.754
I GUESS THE ONLY.

00:46:30.821 --> 00:46:32.456
CONCERN IS THAT.

00:46:32.523 --> 00:46:33.824

00:46:46.570 --> 00:46:47.037
COLUMN.

00:46:47.104 --> 00:46:48.539
AND WE PUT SOME MONEY IN THE

00:46:48.605 --> 00:46:49.139
STATE COMMISSION PROGRAMS NOW

00:46:49.206 --> 00:46:49.373
AND SO.

00:48:09.353 --> 00:48:10.754
L. C. F. F. AT K. TWELVE IN THE

00:48:10.821 --> 00:48:12.222
NOW BEYOND THAT OF THE COMMUNITY

00:48:12.289 --> 00:48:13.523
COLLEGE LEVEL WE HAVE A

00:48:13.590 --> 00:48:14.725
SOMETHING THAT REFLECTS ALL SEE

00:48:14.791 --> 00:48:16.260
OF HAVE SO WHY WOULD BE.

00:48:16.326 --> 00:48:20.297
WHAT WOULD MORE MONEY DO?

00:48:20.364 --> 00:48:20.964
MY ONLY CONCERN IS DOESN'T SEEM

00:48:21.031 --> 00:48:21.565
REALLY DEFINED IT DON'T REALLY

00:48:21.632 --> 00:48:22.532
SEEM.

00:48:22.599 --> 00:48:24.434
THERE'S NO SPECIFIC AS TO WHAT.

00:48:24.501 --> 00:48:25.836
WHAT WHAT WHAT THIS WOULD LOOK

00:48:25.902 --> 00:48:27.437
LIKE ON THE GROUND OR EVEN EVEN

00:48:27.504 --> 00:48:28.772
THE OUTCOMES?

00:48:28.839 --> 00:48:30.307
IS A DEFINED HOW THE OUTCOMES

00:48:30.374 --> 00:48:31.441
WOULD BE MEASURED.

00:48:31.508 --> 00:48:32.743
AT THERE WERE THERE IS REPORTING

00:48:32.809 --> 00:48:34.244
LANGUAGE IN THE BUDGET BILL

00:48:34.311 --> 00:48:35.679
LANGUAGE THAT WOULD HAVE.

00:48:35.746 --> 00:48:38.015
THE GRANT RECIPIENTS REPORT BACK

00:48:38.081 --> 00:48:39.349
TO THE PART OF FINANCE AND THE

00:48:39.416 --> 00:48:41.818
LEGISLATURE ON OUTCOMES THE

00:48:41.885 --> 00:48:43.387
RECIPIENTS OF THE GRANTS -- AS

00:48:43.453 --> 00:48:45.422
WELL AS SOME OUTCOME INFORMATION

00:48:45.489 --> 00:48:48.692
FOR STUDENT OUTCOMES.

00:48:48.759 --> 00:48:50.661
IT JUST SEEMS IS THIS SEEMS TO

00:48:50.727 --> 00:48:51.128
ME.

00:48:51.194 --> 00:48:52.629
MISTER CHAIR OF DISSOLVED ISSUE

00:48:52.696 --> 00:48:53.497
MY OPINION US JUST DOES SEEM

00:48:53.563 --> 00:48:55.866
CLEAR IS WHAT THE GOALS NUMBER.

00:48:55.932 --> 00:48:57.067
ONE IT SHOULD BE MORE SPECIFIC

00:48:57.134 --> 00:48:58.368
THE OUTCOMES.

00:48:58.435 --> 00:48:59.970
AND I'VE BEEN JUST IT SEEMS LIKE

00:49:00.037 --> 00:49:01.672
IT'S JUST TOSSING MONEY OTHERS

00:49:01.738 --> 00:49:02.339
HE WANTS TO GRAB IT QUITE

00:49:02.406 --> 00:49:03.373
FRANKLY.

00:49:03.440 --> 00:49:06.610
SO IN IN IN IF K. TWELVE ARE YOU

00:49:06.677 --> 00:49:07.177
REALLY LISTEN TEY COULD USE

00:49:07.244 --> 00:49:08.011
MORE MONEY.

00:49:08.078 --> 00:49:09.713
BE THE FIRST CHAMPION OF THAT IN

00:49:09.780 --> 00:49:11.048
THIS BODY BUT IF YOU JUST CAN

00:49:11.114 --> 00:49:14.384
OFFER A MONEY FOR SOMETHING

00:49:14.451 --> 00:49:15.752
THEY'RE ALREADY DOING.

00:49:15.819 --> 00:49:16.553
SHOULD WE OFFERED ACROSS THE

00:49:16.620 --> 00:49:17.154
STATE.

00:49:17.220 --> 00:49:17.721
BECAUSE WE HAVE THESE ISSUES

00:49:17.788 --> 00:49:18.955
ACROSS THE STATE.

00:49:19.022 --> 00:49:20.324
RIGHT SO THAT THE TWO AREAS FOR

00:49:20.390 --> 00:49:22.626
THIS PROPOSAL THE INLAND EMPIRE

00:49:22.693 --> 00:49:24.394
AND SAN JOAQUIN REGIONS WERE

00:49:24.461 --> 00:49:26.029
IDENTIFIED AS PRIORITIES BY THE

00:49:26.096 --> 00:49:28.932
ADMINISTRATION -- A FEW REASONS

00:49:28.999 --> 00:49:30.400
THAT LED TO THAT PRIORITIZATION

00:49:30.467 --> 00:49:32.469
INCLUDING REAL PERSONAL INCOME

00:49:32.536 --> 00:49:34.137
BEING LOWER IN THOSE AREAS THAN

00:49:34.204 --> 00:49:35.305
THEY ARE FOR THE STATEWIDE

00:49:35.372 --> 00:49:37.207
AVERAGE UNEMPLOYMENT BEING

00:49:37.274 --> 00:49:38.608
SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER IN THOSE

00:49:38.675 --> 00:49:39.976
REGIONS THAN THE STATEWIDE

00:49:40.043 --> 00:49:41.345
AVERAGE.

00:49:41.411 --> 00:49:43.447
AND THEN ALSO WHILE THEY SEE --

00:49:43.513 --> 00:49:44.414
INCREASING NUMBERS OF HIGH

00:49:44.481 --> 00:49:45.782
SCHOOL GRADUATES WERE SEEING

00:49:45.849 --> 00:49:47.484
LOWER THAN STATEWIDE AVERAGE

00:49:47.551 --> 00:49:49.353
NUMBER THAT MEET THE ADMISSIONS

00:49:49.419 --> 00:49:51.788
CRITERIA FOR UC AND CSU.

00:49:51.855 --> 00:49:53.523
SO THIS PROPOSAL IS REALLY AIMED

00:49:53.590 --> 00:49:55.225
AT JUST GENERATING -- AND

00:49:55.292 --> 00:49:57.294
INCENTIVIZING SOME INNOVATIVE

00:49:57.361 --> 00:49:59.429
STRATEGIES THAT K. TWELVE OR

00:49:59.496 --> 00:50:01.231
POST SECONDARY INSTITUTIONS MAY

00:50:01.298 --> 00:50:03.600
COME UP WITH IN CONJUNCTION WITH

00:50:03.667 --> 00:50:05.469
OTHER ENTITIES AS WELL -- AIMED

00:50:05.535 --> 00:50:07.871
AT AT ADDRESSING THOSE ISSUES SO

00:50:07.938 --> 00:50:09.306
IT IS FOCUSED MORE AT

00:50:09.373 --> 00:50:10.741
IMPLEMENTING INNOVATIVE

00:50:10.807 --> 00:50:13.410
STRATEGIES THAT ARE NEW IDEAS.

00:50:13.477 --> 00:50:15.545
TO CREATE MORE OF A A MULTI

00:50:15.612 --> 00:50:18.215
GENERATIONAL COLLEGE ATTAINMENT --

00:50:18.281 --> 00:50:20.851
CULTURE IN THOSE REGIONS AND TO

00:50:20.917 --> 00:50:22.819
GENERATE MORE COLLEGE ATTENDANCE

00:50:22.886 --> 00:50:25.989
GOT IT GOT IT WELL LISTEN I WAS

00:50:26.056 --> 00:50:27.090
FROM THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY.

00:50:27.157 --> 00:50:28.759
OR FROM THE INLAND EMPIRE.

00:50:28.825 --> 00:50:29.359
I UNDERSTAND WHY WOULD SUPPORT

00:50:29.426 --> 00:50:30.727
THIS BUT ALTHOUGH I'M NOT.

00:50:30.794 --> 00:50:32.462
I'M NOT SAYING THIS ISN'T A GOOD

00:50:32.529 --> 00:50:34.164
IDEA AS MUCH AS I'M SAYING THIS

00:50:34.231 --> 00:50:34.998
DOESN'T APPEAR TO BE FLUSHED OUT

00:50:35.065 --> 00:50:36.032
TO ME.

00:50:36.099 --> 00:50:37.667
AS SOON TO WHAT THE FULL INTENT

00:50:37.734 --> 00:50:39.503
IS BECAUSE WE ALREADY HAVE A LOT

00:50:39.569 --> 00:50:41.638
OF PROGRAMS THAT ADDRESS THESE

00:50:41.705 --> 00:50:43.306

00:52:53.870 --> 00:52:55.539
HELLO.

00:52:55.605 --> 00:52:57.674
SO REVIEWING THESE PROPOSALS ON

00:52:57.741 --> 00:52:59.342
PAGE FOUR OF YOUR AGENDA.

00:52:59.409 --> 00:53:01.678
FROM WHAT WE IDENTIFIED A FEW

00:53:01.745 --> 00:53:03.947
CROSS CUTTING -- ISSUES TO

00:53:04.014 --> 00:53:05.382
CONSIDER AND ALL ALL WALK

00:53:05.448 --> 00:53:07.217
THROUGH A THREE OF THOSE ISSUES

00:53:07.284 --> 00:53:08.585
RIGHT NOW.

00:53:08.652 --> 00:53:10.353
THE FIRST ISSUE IS WHILE A

00:53:10.420 --> 00:53:12.022
NUMBER OF THESE PROPOSALS ARE

00:53:12.088 --> 00:53:14.157
ONE TIME -- THEY ARE

00:53:14.224 --> 00:53:14.958
UNDERSTANDING IS THERE THEY

00:53:15.025 --> 00:53:16.326
COULD THERE COULD BE SOME

00:53:16.393 --> 00:53:18.328
ADDITIONAL COSTS IN LATER YEARS

00:53:18.395 --> 00:53:18.929
ASSOCIATED WITH SOME OF THESE

00:53:18.995 --> 00:53:19.763
PROPOSALS.

00:53:19.829 --> 00:53:20.797
YOU MIGHT WANT TO UNDERSTAND

00:53:20.864 --> 00:53:22.999
WHAT WHAT THOSE POTENTIAL OUT

00:53:23.066 --> 00:53:23.934
YOUR COSTS COULD BE.

00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:25.669
A GOOD EXAMPLE OF THAT IS ONE OF

00:53:25.735 --> 00:53:26.736
THE PROPOSALS WOULD BE TO

00:53:26.803 --> 00:53:28.438
PROVIDE SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND

00:53:28.505 --> 00:53:30.640
DOLLARS ONE TIME TO START THE

00:53:30.707 --> 00:53:32.175
INITIAL STAGES OF DEVELOPING A

00:53:32.242 --> 00:53:35.512
STATE WIDE INVENTORY OF CULTURAL

00:53:35.579 --> 00:53:36.146
HISTORICAL ASSETS THROUGHOUT THE

00:53:36.212 --> 00:53:37.213
STATE.

00:53:37.280 --> 00:53:38.481
A STEP FOR THE STATE LIBRARY

00:53:38.548 --> 00:53:40.216
NOTED THAT THE FUNDING MAY NOT

00:53:40.283 --> 00:53:41.585
BE ENOUGH TO FULLY COMPLETE THE

00:53:41.651 --> 00:53:43.486
INVENTORY THIS COULD JUST SORT

00:53:43.553 --> 00:53:44.721
OF BE THE FOR THE FIRST STAGES

00:53:44.788 --> 00:53:46.156
OF OCT FOR MULTI YEAR EFFORT.

00:53:46.222 --> 00:53:47.257
THAT WOULD NOT ONLY DEVELOP THE

00:53:47.324 --> 00:53:49.025
INVENTORY BUT ALSO IDENTIFY LONG

00:53:49.092 --> 00:53:52.228
TERM STRATEGIES. TO PROTECT.

00:53:52.295 --> 00:53:54.097
RESOURCES DEEMED AT RISK OF

00:53:54.164 --> 00:53:55.565
DAMAGE OR OR LOSS.

00:53:55.632 --> 00:53:56.499
AND SO YOU MIGHT WANT TO

00:53:56.566 --> 00:53:57.167
UNDERSTAND WHAT THOSE ADDITIONAL

00:53:57.233 --> 00:53:58.802
OUT YOUR COSTS ARE AND WHAT THE

00:53:58.868 --> 00:54:00.103
OVER ARCHING PLAN IS AS YOUR AS

00:54:00.170 --> 00:54:01.538
YOUR WEIGHING WHETHER OR NOT TO

00:54:01.605 --> 00:54:02.973
ADOPT THIS PROPOSAL.

00:54:03.039 --> 00:54:05.709
ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF IT -- FOR ONE

00:54:05.775 --> 00:54:06.676
OF THE GRANT LOCAL ASSISTANCE

00:54:06.743 --> 00:54:08.378
GRANT PROGRAMS FOR AFTER SCHOOL

00:54:08.445 --> 00:54:09.379
PROGRAMS.

00:54:09.446 --> 00:54:11.381
ARE THIS IS FUNDING ACTIVITIES

00:54:11.448 --> 00:54:12.749
THAT ARE THAT ARE PROVIDING THAT

00:54:12.816 --> 00:54:14.217
LIBRARIES ARE PROVIDING AFTER

00:54:14.284 --> 00:54:15.585
SCHOOL SERVICES TO STUDENTS.

00:54:15.652 --> 00:54:18.622
AND SO THE QUESTION HERE IS --

00:54:18.688 --> 00:54:20.357
HOW WITH THE LIBRARY SUSTAIN

00:54:20.423 --> 00:54:21.758
THOSE -- ACTIVITIES ON AN

00:54:21.825 --> 00:54:25.428
ONGOING BASIS IN LATER YEARS

00:54:25.495 --> 00:54:25.996
GIVEN THAT THIS IS ONE TIME

00:54:26.062 --> 00:54:27.631
FUNDING.

I'M GOING TO ADDRESS THE FIRST

00:58:36.546 --> 00:58:38.348
TWO PROPOSALS ON IF IT'S IF IT

ON THE RAPID RE HOUSING PROPOSAL

00:58:41.551 --> 00:58:43.953

A LITTLE MUCH LARGER DOLLAR

00:58:45.588 --> 00:58:47.056
AMOUNT PROPOSAL FOR CSU.

00:58:47.123 --> 00:58:48.157
WE THOUGHT FOR THE SAKE OF TIME

00:58:48.224 --> 00:58:49.626
WE COULD CONSOLIDATE OUR

00:58:49.692 --> 00:58:51.594
COMMENTS ON THE CSU ITEM -- SAW

00:58:51.661 --> 00:58:53.963
FOCUS MY MY COMMENTS ON THE

00:58:54.030 --> 00:58:55.365
FIRST TWO ITEMS.

00:58:55.431 --> 00:58:56.966
WITH REGARD TO THE FIRST

00:58:57.033 --> 00:58:59.102
PROPOSAL FOR YOU SEE OUR P..

00:58:59.168 --> 00:59:00.937
WE THINK THIS RAISES THREE KEY

00:59:01.004 --> 00:59:02.739
ISSUES FOR CONSIDERATION.

00:59:02.805 --> 00:59:03.573
THE FIRST ISSUE FOR

00:59:03.640 --> 00:59:05.708
CONSIDERATION IS A FAIRLY BROAD

00:59:05.775 --> 00:59:07.143
ISSUE THAT THE LEGISLATURE FACES

00:59:07.210 --> 00:59:08.678
EACH YEAR AS IT'S THINKING ABOUT

00:59:08.745 --> 00:59:10.313
ADDRESSING THE STATE'S.

00:59:10.380 --> 00:59:12.215
A LONG TERM LIABILITIES.

00:59:12.282 --> 00:59:12.715
ARE THE CITY CURRENTLY

00:59:12.782 --> 00:59:14.183
CONTRIBUTES FUNDS INTO THREE

00:59:14.250 --> 00:59:16.419
PENSION SYSTEMS CALPERS CASTERS

00:59:16.486 --> 00:59:18.354
AND USE YOUR PC.

00:59:18.421 --> 00:59:20.323
AND SO THE QUESTION IS.

00:59:20.390 --> 00:59:20.957
GIVEN THAT ALL THREE OF THESE

00:59:21.024 --> 00:59:21.457
SYSTEMS HAVE UNFUNDED

00:59:21.524 --> 00:59:23.092
LIABILITIES WHAT'S HOW DO YOU

00:59:23.159 --> 00:59:25.028
PRIORITIZE FUNDS TO ADDRESS

00:59:25.094 --> 00:59:26.262
THESE UNFUNDED LIABILITIES.

00:59:26.329 --> 00:59:28.031
WHAT APPROACH WOULD BE TO

00:59:28.097 --> 00:59:30.300
ADDRESS THE UNFUNDED LIABILITIES

00:59:30.366 --> 00:59:32.335
AND PERSON STIRS FIRST?

00:59:32.402 --> 00:59:33.703
THE RATIONALE BEHIND APPROACH

00:59:33.770 --> 00:59:34.837
WHERE THE LEGISLATIVE

00:59:34.904 --> 00:59:35.371
LEGISLATURE TO TAKE THAT

00:59:35.438 --> 00:59:37.640
APPROACH WOULD BE THAT THE STATE

00:59:37.707 --> 00:59:39.609
ALL UP LARGELY DETERMINES

00:59:39.676 --> 00:59:41.744
PENSION BENEFITS FOR EMPLOYEES

00:59:41.811 --> 00:59:42.879
IN THE SYSTEMS.

00:59:42.946 --> 00:59:44.314
IT ALSO DETERMINES THE FUNDING

00:59:44.380 --> 00:59:45.281
POLICIES.

00:59:45.348 --> 00:59:47.550
BY CONTRAST THE REGION'S NOT THE

00:59:47.617 --> 00:59:49.886
STATE LEGISLATURE DIRECTLY ADOPT

00:59:49.953 --> 00:59:51.688
PENSION BENEFITS IN THE FUNDING

00:59:51.754 --> 00:59:53.022
POLICY FOR YOU SEE OUR P..

00:59:53.089 --> 00:59:56.659
SO THERE'S A SOMEWHAT LESS CLEAR --

00:59:56.726 --> 00:59:59.429
STATES -- RESPONSIBILITY TO

00:59:59.495 --> 01:00:01.297
ADDRESS ANY UNFUNDED LIABILITIES

01:00:01.364 --> 01:00:04.701
RESULTING FROM UNDER FUNDING --

01:00:04.767 --> 01:00:05.601
THE PENSION SYSTEM IN PREVIOUS

01:00:05.668 --> 01:00:07.403
YEARS NOT SO THE LEGISLATURE

01:00:07.470 --> 01:00:08.571
MIGHT BE INTERESTED AND

01:00:08.638 --> 01:00:10.173
ADDRESSING COST PRESSURES AT THE

01:00:10.239 --> 01:00:11.607
UNIVERSITY.

01:00:11.674 --> 01:00:12.408
IF I WERE INTERESTED IN DOING

01:00:12.475 --> 01:00:14.444
THAT -- IT COULD A BIG COULD

01:00:14.510 --> 01:00:17.180
APPROPRIATE THE ONE TIME FUNDING

01:00:17.246 --> 01:00:18.514
FOR YOU SEE OUR P..

01:00:18.581 --> 01:00:19.682
THAT SAID OUR SECOND ISSUE FOR

01:00:19.749 --> 01:00:21.384
CONSIDERATION IS THAT ONE WAY

01:00:21.451 --> 01:00:22.685
THE LEGISLATURE COULD SORT OF

01:00:22.752 --> 01:00:25.088
GAUGE HIS QUESTION IS BY HAVING.

01:00:25.154 --> 01:00:26.823
AN ASSET AND AN ESTIMATE OF THE

01:00:26.889 --> 01:00:28.257
FISCAL SAVINGS ASSOCIATED WITH

01:00:28.324 --> 01:00:29.959
PAYING DOWN THE UNFUNDED

01:00:30.026 --> 01:00:31.661
LIABILITY FASTER.

01:00:31.728 --> 01:00:32.628
RIGHT NOW THE ADMINISTRATION

01:00:32.695 --> 01:00:33.629
HASN'T PROVIDED THAT ESTIMATES

01:00:33.696 --> 01:00:34.964
THE LEGISLATURE'S LACKING A KEY

01:00:35.031 --> 01:00:36.366
PIECE OF INFORMATION TO MAKE

01:00:36.432 --> 01:00:37.433
THAT DETERMINATION THAT'S

01:00:37.500 --> 01:00:38.501
SOMETHING YOU COULD REQUEST FROM

01:00:38.568 --> 01:00:40.737
THE ADMINISTRATION BEFORE MAKING

01:00:40.803 --> 01:00:42.805
FINAL DECISIONS ON THIS PROPOSAL.

01:00:42.872 --> 01:00:43.873
THIRD.

01:00:43.940 --> 01:00:44.607
WE RECOMMEND THAT IF THE

01:00:44.674 --> 01:00:47.910
LEGISLATURE DOES DECIDE TO ADOPT --

01:00:47.977 --> 01:00:49.779
FUND THIS PROPOSAL IT COULD

01:00:49.846 --> 01:00:52.115
CONSIDER -- SOME SORT OF MATCH

01:00:52.181 --> 01:00:53.316
BETWEEN THE GENERAL FUND IN UC'S

01:00:53.383 --> 01:00:55.785
NON STATE FUNDING. FOR SOME

01:00:55.852 --> 01:00:57.653
CONTEXT OF UC'S ABOUT TEN

01:00:57.720 --> 01:00:58.988
BILLION DOLLAR LIVE UNFUNDED

01:00:59.055 --> 01:01:00.189
LIABILITY THAT'S ROUTE

01:01:00.256 --> 01:01:00.890
REPRESENTS THE UNFUNDED

01:01:00.957 --> 01:01:02.525
LIABILITY ACROSS THE ENTIRE

01:01:02.592 --> 01:01:03.593
UNIVERSITY SYSTEM.

01:01:03.659 --> 01:01:05.328
BOTH WITH ITS CORE ACADEMIC

01:01:05.395 --> 01:01:06.863
PROGRAMS AND ITS NON CORE

HOUSING PROGRAMS.

01:01:14.003 --> 01:01:15.071
I'M A FIRM IN PROVIDING SOME

01:01:15.138 --> 01:01:16.272
SORT OF MATCH WOULD ENSURE THAT

01:01:16.339 --> 01:01:17.607
THE STATE IS PAYING FOR THE

01:01:17.673 --> 01:01:18.908
PORTION THAT'S ASSOCIATED WITH

01:01:18.975 --> 01:01:20.777
THE ACADEMIC PROGRAMS AND THAT

01:01:20.843 --> 01:01:22.912
THE NOT SAFE PORTION IS PAYING

01:01:22.979 --> 01:01:23.780
FOR THE NON STATE FUNCTIONS OF

THE OF THE SYRUPY.

01:01:25.048 --> 01:01:26.249
AND WE WOULD NOTE THAT THIS

01:01:26.315 --> 01:01:28.151
CONCEPT OF OF SHARING BETWEEN

01:01:28.217 --> 01:01:29.852
CORE NON CORE FUNDING.

01:01:29.919 --> 01:01:31.254
IS ALREADY PRESENT USE YOUR P.

01:01:36.692 --> 01:01:38.061
COMBINATION OF CORE FUNDING AND

01:01:38.127 --> 01:01:39.429
AND NON CORE FUNDING.

01:01:39.495 --> 01:01:40.630
SO THIS WOULD THIS THIS MATCHING

01:01:40.696 --> 01:01:42.365
POLICY WOULD EFFECTIVELY

01:01:42.432 --> 01:01:45.334
RECOGNIZE THAT WHAT WHAT HOW

01:01:45.401 --> 01:01:47.270
IT'S ALREADY FUNDED.

01:01:47.336 --> 01:01:49.205
REGARDING THE SECOND PROPOSAL ON

WE WOULD NOTE THAT THE

01:01:53.576 --> 01:01:55.111
ADMINISTRATION OUR UNDERSTANDING

01:01:55.178 --> 01:01:56.245
OF THIS PROPOSAL IS THAT THE

01:01:56.312 --> 01:01:57.647
PILOT WOULD BE PART OF A BROADER

01:01:57.713 --> 01:01:59.782
EFFORT. TO SCALE ACROSS THE

01:01:59.849 --> 01:02:02.485
STATE NEW WAYS TO TEST AND TO

01:02:04.387 --> 01:02:06.022
DYSLEXIA OR OTHER FORMS OF

01:02:06.089 --> 01:02:08.558
LEARNING DISABILITIES.

01:02:08.624 --> 01:02:09.725
THE FIRST CONSIDERATION THE

01:02:09.792 --> 01:02:11.461
LEGISLATURE COULD MAKE IS HOW

01:02:11.527 --> 01:02:12.628
THIS PROPOSAL WOULD INTERACT

01:02:12.695 --> 01:02:13.496
WITH THE STATE'S EXISTING

01:02:13.563 --> 01:02:15.598
SPECIAL EDUCATION INFRASTRUCTURE

01:02:15.665 --> 01:02:17.500

ARCHING ARE FULL OF THE PILOT IS

01:02:25.575 --> 01:02:26.943
TO POTENTIALLY SCALE THIS STATE

01:02:27.009 --> 01:02:28.678
WHY THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO

01:02:28.744 --> 01:02:29.879
UNDERSTAND.

01:02:29.946 --> 01:02:31.614
OF THE THE THE PATH THAT THE

01:02:31.681 --> 01:02:34.083
ADMINISTRATION SEES TO GET THERE

01:02:34.150 --> 01:02:36.052
BEFORE PERFORATING FUNDING.

01:02:36.119 --> 01:02:37.653
THIRD OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THAT

01:02:37.720 --> 01:02:39.222
THE CENTER HAS RAISED TENS OF

01:02:39.288 --> 01:02:40.356
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND PRIVATE

THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO

01:02:44.827 --> 01:02:45.495
UNDERSTAND.

01:02:45.561 --> 01:02:46.963
WHY THESE FUNDS MAY NOT BE

01:02:47.029 --> 01:02:49.232
AVAILABLE IN WIDE STATE FUNDING

01:02:49.298 --> 01:02:49.799
IS NEEDED TO CARRY OUT THIS

01:02:49.866 --> 01:02:50.867
PILOT?

01:02:50.933 --> 01:02:52.068

01:07:46.562 --> 01:07:48.264
SO THE STUDY IN TERMS OF

01:07:48.330 --> 01:07:50.666
HOMELESSNESS -- SHOWCASE AT 5%

01:07:50.733 --> 01:07:52.134
OF BOTH YOU SEE UNDERGRADUATE

01:07:52.201 --> 01:07:53.702
GRADUATE STUDENT POPULATIONS SAY

01:07:53.769 --> 01:07:55.037
THAT HAD EXPERIENCE HOMELESSNESS

01:07:55.104 --> 01:07:56.505
AT SOME POINT DURING THEIR

01:07:56.572 --> 01:07:58.374
ENROLLMENT WITH VARIOUS DEGREES

01:07:58.441 --> 01:07:59.175
ACROSS THE DIFFERENT CAMPUSES

01:07:59.241 --> 01:08:00.743
WARRING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT

01:08:00.810 --> 01:08:02.144
HOUSING MARKETS.

01:08:02.211 --> 01:08:02.812
AND THE DEFINITION OF

01:08:02.878 --> 01:08:03.846
HOMELESSNESS AND YOU SEE

01:08:03.913 --> 01:08:05.648
QUESTION PROVIDED MULTIPLE

01:08:05.714 --> 01:08:07.650
EXPONENTIAL CIRCUMSTANCES FOR

01:08:07.716 --> 01:08:09.385
PEOPLE TO IDENTIFY WITH BEYOND

01:08:09.452 --> 01:08:10.853
JUST HOMELESSNESS SUCH AS COUCH

01:08:10.920 --> 01:08:12.688
SURFING -- AT A FRIEND'S PLACE

01:08:12.755 --> 01:08:14.323
OR LIVING ON THE STREETS OR

01:08:14.390 --> 01:08:15.691
SLEEPING OVERNIGHT AT LIBRARIES

01:08:15.758 --> 01:08:17.660
WHAT WE LEARNED HERE IS THAT

01:08:17.726 --> 01:08:19.662
LGBT PLUS STUDENTS TRANSFER

01:08:19.728 --> 01:08:21.464
STUDENTS LOW INCOME STATUS

01:08:21.530 --> 01:08:22.198
STUDENTS.

01:08:22.264 --> 01:08:23.566
AND FORMER FOSS YOUTH EACH HAVE

01:08:23.632 --> 01:08:25.835
HIGHER RATES AS COMPARED TO

01:08:25.901 --> 01:08:27.470
THEIR COUNTERPARTS -- AND THE

01:08:27.536 --> 01:08:28.938
IMPACT ON ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE

01:08:29.004 --> 01:08:30.105
IS THAT FOR STUDENTS ARE

01:08:30.172 --> 01:08:31.974
EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS OR

01:08:32.041 --> 01:08:33.476
HOUSING IN SECURITY THE

01:08:33.542 --> 01:08:35.744
CONSISTENTLY OUTPERFORM LOWER

01:08:35.811 --> 01:08:37.680
THAN THEIR COUNTERPARTS WHO ARE

01:08:37.746 --> 01:08:39.849
HOUSING SECURE AND OUR FOOD ARE

01:08:39.915 --> 01:08:40.950
AND OR FOOD TO CARE.

01:08:41.016 --> 01:08:42.551
SOMETHING THAT'S NOTABLE IS THAT

01:08:42.618 --> 01:08:47.957
STUDENTS ARE EXPERIENCING BOTH

01:08:48.023 --> 01:08:49.291
FOOD AND SECURITY IN HOMELESS

01:08:49.358 --> 01:08:50.726
LANCE IN THEIR FIRST YEAR SECOND

01:08:50.793 --> 01:08:51.460
YEAR AND THIRTY YEAR ALL ARE

01:08:51.527 --> 01:08:52.394
BELOW THREE POINT OH GPA.

01:08:52.461 --> 01:08:52.962
WHICH MAKE SIX SIGNIFICANTLY

01:08:53.028 --> 01:08:53.596
MORE DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO FIND

01:08:53.662 --> 01:08:54.997
ON AND OFF CAMPUS JOBS AND THEN

01:08:55.064 --> 01:08:57.032
IMPACTS THEIR TRANSITIONS TO

01:08:57.099 --> 01:08:58.400
GRADUATE SCHOOL AFTER THE FACT.

01:08:58.467 --> 01:08:59.468
SO WHEN IT COMES TO THIS RAPID

IS MORE OF A FOR A ONE CASE

01:11:23.278 --> 01:11:25.514
STYLE PLAN SO IS THAT ALL

01:11:25.581 --> 01:11:27.016
EXASPERATING.

01:11:27.082 --> 01:11:28.684
THE PENSION PROBLEM.

01:11:28.751 --> 01:11:30.185
WE DON'T THINK SO WE ACTUALLY

01:11:30.252 --> 01:11:31.920
THINK THE FOUR ONE CAPE STYLE

01:11:31.987 --> 01:11:33.889

EMPLOYEE CHOOSES TRADITIONAL OR

01:11:50.239 --> 01:11:51.774
THE FOUR OH ONE K. STYLE PLAN.

01:11:51.840 --> 01:11:53.075
THAT IS USED TO PAY DOWN THE

01:11:53.142 --> 01:11:54.510
UNFUNDED LIABILITY OF THE

01:11:54.576 --> 01:11:56.912
TRADITIONAL PLAN -- WHAT MAKES

01:11:56.979 --> 01:11:58.614
THE FOUR ONE CASE STYLE PLAN

01:11:58.681 --> 01:12:00.049
OTHER DEFINED CONTRIBUTION

01:12:00.115 --> 01:12:02.317
ATTRACTIVE FOR OUR EMPLOYEES?

01:12:02.384 --> 01:12:03.986
IS WE FIND THAT THE YOUNGER

01:12:04.053 --> 01:12:06.221
WORKFORCE MOVES -- IN AND OUT OF

01:12:06.288 --> 01:12:07.322
THE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM QUITE

01:12:07.389 --> 01:12:10.359
RAPIDLY THEY COME FOR A COUPLE

01:12:10.426 --> 01:12:12.261
YEARS AND THEN I UNDERSTAND THAT

01:12:12.327 --> 01:12:13.228
I JUST IN THE THE THINKING THERE.

01:12:13.295 --> 01:12:13.896
AGAIN I'M NOT QUESTIONING THAT I

01:12:13.962 --> 01:12:14.897
JUST WANTED MY QUESTION WAS

01:12:14.963 --> 01:12:17.666
REALLY POURED INTO WHETHER OR

01:12:17.733 --> 01:12:18.867
NOT IT'S EXASPERATING.

01:12:18.934 --> 01:12:21.003
THE ANY LIABILITY -- IMPACTING

01:12:21.070 --> 01:12:23.005
ANY LIABILITY AND YOU RESPONDED

01:12:23.072 --> 01:12:24.440
SO THANK YOU AND THEN IT SAYS

01:12:24.506 --> 01:12:25.607
FIVE MILLION DOLLARS -- FOR YOU

01:12:25.674 --> 01:12:26.308
WANT TO SHIP FIVE BILLION

01:12:26.375 --> 01:12:27.376
DOLLARS APPEARS OF DEFERRED

01:12:27.443 --> 01:12:29.712
MAINTENANCE FUNDS TO CONDUCT A

01:12:29.778 --> 01:12:30.779
FACILITY NEEDS STUDY.

01:12:30.846 --> 01:12:32.347
THAT'S CORRECT WE WERE GOING TO

01:12:32.414 --> 01:12:35.317
USE FIVE MILLION OF OUR A. B.

01:12:35.384 --> 01:12:35.884
NINETY FOUR CAPITAL OUTLAY

01:12:35.951 --> 01:12:38.554
PROCESS. FOR THE FACILITY STUDY

01:12:38.620 --> 01:12:40.656
THAT'S BOND DEBT AND DELAY --

01:12:40.723 --> 01:12:42.324
HAD RECOMMENDED WE INSTEAD USE

01:12:42.391 --> 01:12:44.059
ONE TIME MONEY SO WE'RE SAYING

01:12:44.126 --> 01:12:45.761
YES WE CAN DO THAT.

01:12:45.828 --> 01:12:47.229
SO WHY IN THE WORLD WILL COST

01:12:47.296 --> 01:12:49.031
FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR A

01:12:49.098 --> 01:12:51.867
FACILITY NEEDS STUDY -- SUCCESS

01:12:51.934 --> 01:12:53.102
I AM I GONNA BE US THAT IS JUST

01:12:53.168 --> 01:12:55.838
CRAZY HOW MANY CAMPUSES. TEN

01:12:55.904 --> 01:12:58.307
CAMPUSES HOW MANY MODERN LOT OF

01:12:58.373 --> 01:12:59.808
SQUARE FOOTAGE WHEN I WAS TEN

01:12:59.875 --> 01:13:01.810
CAMPUS SEVEN CAMPUSES SO IT'S

01:13:01.877 --> 01:13:02.444
FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS.

01:13:02.511 --> 01:13:03.812
TO DO A FACILITIES ASSESSMENT

01:13:03.879 --> 01:13:06.281
STUDY FOR EACH CAMPUS I DON'T

01:13:06.348 --> 01:13:07.249
BELIEVE THAT I THINK THAT'S

01:13:07.316 --> 01:13:08.584
CRAZY.

01:13:08.650 --> 01:13:09.585
I I JUST THERE IT'S BEEN CANNOT

01:13:09.651 --> 01:13:11.053
CONVINCE ME THAT IT'S FIVE

01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:12.521
MILLION DOLLARS WERE THE WORK TO

01:13:12.588 --> 01:13:14.323
SAY WELL WE NEED THIS MUCH SPACE

01:13:14.389 --> 01:13:16.425
WE WE HAVE TO HAVE PROFESSIONAL

01:13:16.492 --> 01:13:18.761
ENGINEERS WHO HAVE A LOT OF

01:13:18.827 --> 01:13:20.462
TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE.

01:13:20.529 --> 01:13:22.231
AND THE COST AND I DON'T.

01:13:22.297 --> 01:13:23.499
I DON'T BUY IT I JUST YOU KNOW

01:13:23.565 --> 01:13:24.800
YOUR COST PER QUARE FOOT IN

01:13:24.867 --> 01:13:26.135
YOUR BILL IS ALONE A PRETTY OUT

01:13:26.201 --> 01:13:27.903
OF THE NORM AND MAYBE THIS IS

01:13:27.970 --> 01:13:30.439
ONE OF THE REASONS WHY BUT I I

01:13:30.506 --> 01:13:37.980
JUST DO NOT BY THAT -- BUT LET'S

01:13:38.046 --> 01:13:41.116
MOVE ON THERE'S FOR HIM IS AND I

01:13:41.183 --> 01:13:42.017
DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS CORRECT IS

01:13:42.084 --> 01:13:42.718
FOUR HUNDRED MILLION TO INCREASE --

01:13:42.785 --> 01:13:43.685
INCREASE TO THE UC LEGAL

01:13:43.752 --> 01:13:45.187
IMMIGRATION SERVICES PROGRAM

01:13:45.254 --> 01:13:46.321
IT'S NOT FOR HER MILLION ISN'T

01:13:46.388 --> 01:13:47.923
NO NO IT'S NOT FOR MY NUMBERS

TOP YOUR HEAD -- FIRST OF ALL --

01:15:53.482 --> 01:15:54.650
IN THIS REPORT THERE'S A SECTION

01:15:54.716 --> 01:15:56.084
THAT TALKS ABOUT HISTORICAL

01:15:56.151 --> 01:15:58.420
CHANGES TO STATE FUNDS SUPPORT

01:15:58.487 --> 01:16:00.923
FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA.

01:16:00.989 --> 01:16:05.027
AND IT TALKS ABOUT HOW -- IN TWO

01:16:05.093 --> 01:16:05.627
THOUSAND TWO THOUSAND ONE THE

01:16:05.694 --> 01:16:06.795
STATE DEDICATED FOUR POINT ONE

01:16:06.862 --> 01:16:07.930
OF THE STATE GENERAL FUND TO THE

01:16:07.996 --> 01:16:09.998
UNIVERSITY TODAY FUNDING FOR THE

01:16:10.065 --> 01:16:11.400
UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA REPRESENTS

01:16:11.466 --> 01:16:13.201
JUST TWO POINT FIVE IN THE STATE

01:16:13.268 --> 01:16:14.036
BUDGET THAT.

01:16:14.102 --> 01:16:15.804
IS AT THE SOUND ACCURATE YES

01:16:15.871 --> 01:16:16.405
OKAY.

01:16:16.471 --> 01:16:20.609
AND THEN -- IN THAT SAME SECTION

01:16:20.676 --> 01:16:22.778
IT TALKS ABOUT -- IT OUT USE

01:16:22.844 --> 01:16:25.881
EITHER I KNOW THAT THERE IS --

01:16:25.948 --> 01:16:28.450
AN EMPHASIS ON THE CORE FUNDS --

01:16:28.517 --> 01:16:29.751
FOR THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA AS

01:16:29.818 --> 01:16:31.353
DISTINGUISHED FROM SOME OF THE

01:16:31.420 --> 01:16:33.355
OTHER MAJOR SOURCE OF REVENUES

01:16:33.422 --> 01:16:34.456
FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA

01:16:34.523 --> 01:16:36.024
SYSTEM LIKE THE MEDICAL CENTERS.

01:16:36.091 --> 01:16:37.926
BUT THE CORE FUNDS IS IS KIND OF

01:16:37.993 --> 01:16:39.628
LIKE YOUR GENERAL FUND THAT THAT

01:16:39.695 --> 01:16:42.164
PROVIDES THE PRIMARILY THAT THE

01:16:42.230 --> 01:16:43.632
SALARIES AND BENEFITS FOR THE

THE MISSION OF THE UNIVERSITY

01:16:47.302 --> 01:16:48.303
CALIFORNIA.

01:16:48.370 --> 01:16:49.771
THAT'S CORRECT AND THE REASON WE

01:16:49.838 --> 01:16:51.340
FOCUS ON THE CORE FUNDS AS WE

01:16:51.406 --> 01:16:52.941
ARE NOT ALLOWED TO TRANSFER

01:16:53.008 --> 01:16:54.509
FUNDING BETWEEN THOSE VARIOUS

01:16:54.576 --> 01:16:56.712
POTS THEIR LEGALLY RESTRICTED SO

01:16:56.778 --> 01:16:58.146
THE CORE FUNDS PAY FOR THE

01:16:58.213 --> 01:16:59.915
INSTRUCTORS THE FACULTY.

01:16:59.982 --> 01:17:01.350
ALL THE STUFF ON THE CAMPUSES.

01:17:01.416 --> 01:17:03.919
OKAY SO -- IN THIS -- SECTION

01:17:03.986 --> 01:17:05.354
TALKING ABOUT.

01:17:05.420 --> 01:17:07.189
THE HISTORIC DECLINE IN STATE OF

01:17:07.255 --> 01:17:08.857
SUPPORT FOR THE UNIVERSITY

01:17:08.924 --> 01:17:09.958
CALIFORNIA.

01:17:10.025 --> 01:17:10.993
THERE IS A SECTION THAT TALKS

01:17:11.059 --> 01:17:12.761
ABOUT STATE SUPPORT FOR THE

01:17:12.828 --> 01:17:14.262
UNIVERSITY'S BASE BUDGET.

01:17:14.329 --> 01:17:17.566
DECLINED BY 56%.

01:17:17.632 --> 01:17:21.937
SINCE TWO THOUSAND TWO THOUSAND

01:17:22.004 --> 01:17:23.572
ONE IS THAT.

01:17:23.638 --> 01:17:24.439
I'M SON RIGHT A MINIMUM READING

01:17:24.506 --> 01:17:25.607

[inaudible]

01:17:27.943 --> 01:17:30.545
AND IT SAYS THAT IN TWO THOUSAND

01:17:30.612 --> 01:17:31.847
TWO THOUSAND ONE STATE FUNDING

01:17:31.913 --> 01:17:33.382

THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED PER

01:17:36.618 --> 01:17:39.221
STUDENT OR ABOUT 72% OF THE

01:17:39.287 --> 01:17:43.225
TOTAL COST -- WHEREAS IN TWENTY

01:17:43.291 --> 01:17:43.825
SEVENTEEN TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE

01:17:43.892 --> 01:17:46.762
STATE'S SHARE DECLINE --

01:17:46.828 --> 01:17:48.930
270-007-0030 OR ABOUT 37% OF THE

01:17:48.997 --> 01:17:50.632
TOTAL COSTS YES THAT'S CORRECT

01:17:50.699 --> 01:17:52.401
THERE'S BEEN A RAPID DECLINE IN

01:17:52.467 --> 01:17:54.936

WHEN WHEN WE LOOK AT THE -- THE

01:17:59.975 --> 01:18:03.311
HISTORY AT LEAST SINCE.

01:18:03.378 --> 01:18:04.913
TWO THOUSAND IT SEEMS LIKE.

01:18:04.980 --> 01:18:07.949
WE HAVE HAD DRAMATIC DECLINES

01:18:08.016 --> 01:18:09.918

RECOVERED -- THE LOSSES FROM

01:18:20.695 --> 01:18:21.997
THOSE TWO RECESSIONS IS IS THAT

01:18:22.064 --> 01:18:24.032
A FAIR DESCRIPTION OF THAT'S

01:18:24.099 --> 01:18:26.668
CORRECT SIR AND ONE OF THE WAYS

01:18:26.735 --> 01:18:28.637
TO UNIVERSITY MADE UP.

01:18:28.703 --> 01:18:29.438
FOR THAT REVENUE WEST BY

YEAH.

01:18:36.611 --> 01:18:38.313
EXACTLY SO SO THE UNIVERSITY

CALIFORNIA FELT LIKE IN ORDER TO

01:18:40.882 --> 01:18:44.219

THAT'S CORRECT OKAY AND AND THAT

01:18:55.330 --> 01:18:59.000
HAS LED TO RESULTS LIKE. 25% OF

01:18:59.067 --> 01:19:00.936
OUR UNDERGRADUATE POPULATION ADD

01:19:01.002 --> 01:19:03.305
TO OUR MOST -- POPULAR --

01:19:03.371 --> 01:19:05.340
CAMPUSES -- BERKELY UCLA AND UC

01:19:05.407 --> 01:19:08.677
SAN DIEGO ONE OUT OF FOUR OF THE

01:19:08.743 --> 01:19:10.612
UNDERGRADS LOTS GOING.

01:19:10.679 --> 01:19:12.147
TO NON CALIFORNIA KIDS.

01:19:12.214 --> 01:19:13.448
THAT'S CORRECT THOSE CAMPUSES

01:19:13.515 --> 01:19:16.651
ARE ABOUT 2423% OKAY SO YOUR

01:19:16.718 --> 01:19:17.853
POSITION IS IS THAT THE

01:19:17.919 --> 01:19:19.888
UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA'S POSITION

01:19:19.955 --> 01:19:21.823
IS THAT.

01:19:21.890 --> 01:19:24.960
AS THAT -- THE THE FACT THAT ARE.

01:19:25.026 --> 01:19:26.761
YOU KNOW ONE OUT OF EVERY FOR

01:19:26.828 --> 01:19:28.130
UNDERGRAD SLOTS FOR THE

01:19:28.196 --> 01:19:29.164
UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA GOING TO

01:19:29.231 --> 01:19:31.399
NON CALIFORNIA KIDS IS.

01:19:31.466 --> 01:19:35.704
A REFLECTION OF OR OR OR IN IN

01:19:35.770 --> 01:19:39.741
IN YOUR OPINION A INEVITABLE --

01:19:39.808 --> 01:19:42.511
WAVE IT WAS A IT WAS A RESPONSE

01:19:42.577 --> 01:19:43.845
TO THE DRAMATIC DECLINE IN STATE

01:19:43.912 --> 01:19:45.614
FUNDING FOR FOR THE UNIVERSITY

01:19:45.680 --> 01:19:47.215
OF CALIFORNIA.

01:19:47.282 --> 01:19:49.985
IT WAS A RESPONSE AND DURING

01:19:50.051 --> 01:19:52.187
THAT TIME WE HAD A LOT OF NEW

01:19:52.254 --> 01:19:53.955
COST PRESSURES WE JUST DISCUSSED

01:19:54.022 --> 01:19:55.390
THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA

01:19:55.457 --> 01:19:57.526
RETIREMENT PROGRAM -- TO

01:19:57.592 --> 01:19:58.560
UNIVERSITY HAD HAD NO

01:19:58.627 --> 01:19:59.928
CONTRIBUTIONS INTO THE

01:19:59.995 --> 01:20:01.229
RETIREMENT PROGRAM BETWEEN THE

01:20:01.296 --> 01:20:04.032
LATE EIGHTIES AND TWENTY TEN AND

01:20:04.099 --> 01:20:05.934
THEN IN TWENTY TEN WHEN -- THE

01:20:06.001 --> 01:20:07.169
GREAT RECESSION HAVE COST A

01:20:07.235 --> 01:20:08.603
COLLAPSE IN THE VALUE OF THE

01:20:08.670 --> 01:20:11.139
PLAN WE HAD TO START UP --

01:20:11.206 --> 01:20:12.774
CONTRIBUTIONS AGAINST THOSE

01:20:12.841 --> 01:20:14.209
CONTRIBUTIONS FROM THE

01:20:14.276 --> 01:20:16.778
UNIVERSITY ARE NOW AT 14% OF

01:20:16.845 --> 01:20:18.246
EVERY EMPLOYEE'S SALARY.

01:20:18.313 --> 01:20:19.915
SO THAT'S A SIGNIFICANT COST

01:20:19.981 --> 01:20:21.650
PRESSURE FOR THE UNIVERSITY IN

01:20:21.716 --> 01:20:23.451
ADDITION -- TO ALL THE OTHER

01:20:23.518 --> 01:20:25.453
COST PRESSURES ANOTHER FACTOR

01:20:25.520 --> 01:20:26.855
THAT OCCURRED IS BECAUSE THE

01:20:26.922 --> 01:20:28.323
STATE HAS HAD NO GEO BONDS FOR

01:20:28.390 --> 01:20:30.559
THE UNIVERSITY SINCE.

01:20:30.625 --> 01:20:31.860
TWO THOUSAND SIX YOU GAVE US THE

01:20:31.927 --> 01:20:33.495
AUTHORITY TO FIND -- BOND

01:20:33.562 --> 01:20:35.363
FINANCING OUT OF OUR OWN BUDGET

01:20:35.430 --> 01:20:37.098
AND WE STARTED DOING THAT IN

01:20:37.165 --> 01:20:38.567
ORDER TO RESPOND.

01:20:38.633 --> 01:20:41.803
TO CREATING MORE SPACE HOWEVER --

01:20:41.870 --> 01:20:43.738
THAT BOND DEBT IS NOW CREATING A

01:20:43.805 --> 01:20:45.740
PRESSURE ON THE UNIVERSITY'S

01:20:45.807 --> 01:20:47.576
OPERATING BUDGET ON THE COR

01:20:47.642 --> 01:20:50.512
FRONT SIDE AS WELL -- AND

01:20:50.579 --> 01:20:52.314
BECAUSE OF THESE COST PRESSURES

01:20:52.380 --> 01:20:53.982
AND INFLATION.

01:20:54.049 --> 01:20:56.218
THE THOUGH THE STATE HAS

01:20:56.284 --> 01:20:58.553
RESTORED OUR FUNDING FROM BILL

01:20:58.620 --> 01:21:03.558
ONE BILLION DOLLAR CUT IN TWO

01:21:03.625 --> 01:21:04.159
THOUSAND NINE TWENTY TEN WHEN

01:21:04.226 --> 01:21:04.526
THAT OCCURRED.

01:21:04.593 --> 01:21:05.093
BECAUSE OF THESE ADDITIONAL

01:21:05.160 --> 01:21:07.128
PRESSURES AND INFLATION AND

01:21:07.195 --> 01:21:09.431
HAVING TO PAY OUR FACULTY MORE --

01:21:09.497 --> 01:21:11.600
WE HAVE FEWER DOLLARS AVAILABLE

01:21:11.666 --> 01:21:14.169
PER STUDENT AT THIS TIME

01:21:14.236 --> 01:21:14.469
[inaudible]

01:21:14.536 --> 01:21:16.605
ALL RIGHT.

01:21:16.671 --> 01:21:18.206
BUT A I I'M JUST TRYING TO KEEP

01:21:18.273 --> 01:21:19.341
OUR FOCUS I MEAN I I I

01:21:19.407 --> 01:21:21.176
APPRECIATE BASICALLY COST

01:21:21.243 --> 01:21:23.278
PRESSURES -- HAVE GONE UP AS A

01:21:23.345 --> 01:21:24.946
AS IT'S GONNA FOR ALL OF OUR

01:21:25.013 --> 01:21:26.548
EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS BUT I

01:21:26.615 --> 01:21:28.250
IN IN TERMS OF THE THE HIGH

01:21:28.316 --> 01:21:30.218
LEVEL BIG PICTURE IT SEEMS TO ME

01:21:30.285 --> 01:21:30.852
THAT.

01:21:30.919 --> 01:21:33.421
THEY GOING FROM THE FROM THE THE

01:21:33.488 --> 01:21:35.257
THE STATE LEGISLATURES.

01:21:35.323 --> 01:21:36.358
US SUPPORT FOR THE UNIVERSITY

01:21:36.424 --> 01:21:39.794
CALIFORNIA FROM ABOUT 70% 72% TO

01:21:39.861 --> 01:21:42.230
ABOUT 37% I MEAN THAT KIND OF

01:21:42.297 --> 01:21:45.100
CAPTURES THE THE ESSENCE OF OF

01:21:45.166 --> 01:21:46.534
THE DRAMATIC DECLINE RANK.

01:21:46.601 --> 01:21:47.869
THAT'S CORRECT OKAY -- DOES THE

01:21:47.936 --> 01:21:51.773
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AGREE WITH --

01:21:51.840 --> 01:21:53.775
THOSE NUMBERS.

01:21:53.842 --> 01:21:56.211
MISTER TUCCI OUT AND LOOKING AT

01:21:56.278 --> 01:21:57.245
THE TRANS IN STATE GENERAL FUND

01:21:57.312 --> 01:21:59.281
SUPPORTED THE UC FROM TWO

01:21:59.347 --> 01:22:01.716
THOUSAND TO TO THE CURRENT YEAR --

01:22:01.783 --> 01:22:03.351
YOU KNOW YOU DO WE DO HAVE.

01:22:03.418 --> 01:22:05.320
SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS IN PER

01:22:05.387 --> 01:22:06.821
STUDENT SUPPORT BUT I THINK IT'S

01:22:06.888 --> 01:22:07.756
NOT CAPTURE HERE'S THE

01:22:07.822 --> 01:22:09.157
SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT IN THE

01:22:09.224 --> 01:22:10.625
CAL GRANT PROGRAM WHICH HAS

01:22:10.692 --> 01:22:12.027
INCREASED DRAMATICALLY SINCE

01:22:12.093 --> 01:22:13.228
THAT TIME PERIOD.

01:22:13.295 --> 01:22:14.496
BECAUSE IN ADDITION TO INCREASE

01:22:14.562 --> 01:22:16.064
NONRESIDENT ROLE MEANT THE

01:22:16.131 --> 01:22:17.432
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA

01:22:17.499 --> 01:22:18.733
DRAMATICALLY INCREASED.

01:22:18.800 --> 01:22:20.035
BASED TUITION DURING THIS TIME

01:22:20.101 --> 01:22:21.836
SO NOT ONLY ARE THEY TAKING AN

01:22:21.903 --> 01:22:23.505
ADDITIONAL FUNDING FROM SUSAN

01:22:23.571 --> 01:22:25.373
FAMILIES IN CALIFORNIA STUDENTS

01:22:25.440 --> 01:22:26.207
AND FAMILIES FROM OUT OF STATE

01:22:26.274 --> 01:22:27.242
AND OTHER COUNTRIES.

01:22:27.309 --> 01:22:28.610
THEY'RE ALSO LEVERAGING

01:22:28.677 --> 01:22:30.578
ADDITIONAL GENERAL FUND THROUGH

01:22:30.645 --> 01:22:32.113
CAL GRANT PROGRAM AND THE LAST I

01:22:32.180 --> 01:22:33.715
CHECKED I THINK THAT'S ABOUT

01:22:33.782 --> 01:22:34.316
SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS

01:22:34.382 --> 01:22:35.150
ANNUALLY.

01:22:35.216 --> 01:22:36.251
ADDITIONALLY WE HAVE THE MIDDLE

01:22:36.318 --> 01:22:37.585
CLASS SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM WHICH

01:22:37.652 --> 01:22:39.354
PROVIDES THAT THE UNIVERSE

01:22:39.421 --> 01:22:40.655
CALIFORNIA WITH A SIZEABLE CHUNK

01:22:40.722 --> 01:22:41.923
OF MONEY AS WELL.

01:22:41.990 --> 01:22:44.059
SO WHILE THOSE PARTICULAR GRAPHS

01:22:44.125 --> 01:22:45.994
AND FIGURES TELL ONE STORY I

01:22:46.061 --> 01:22:47.529
THINK THERE'S A BROADER LOOK AT

01:22:47.595 --> 01:22:48.997
HOW THE FUNDING SOURCES OF THE

01:22:49.064 --> 01:22:50.165
UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA'S CHANGE

01:22:50.231 --> 01:22:51.599
OF THE LAST TWENTY YEARS.

01:22:51.666 --> 01:22:56.137
OKAY SO THE A FAIR ENOUGH SO --

01:22:56.204 --> 01:23:01.876
FOR THE CAL GRANT -- STATE.

01:23:01.943 --> 01:23:03.611
FUNDING AS WELL AS THE MIDDLE

01:23:03.678 --> 01:23:04.279
CLASS SCHOLARSHIP -- WHAT DO YOU

01:23:04.346 --> 01:23:04.879
DO YOU KNOW APPROXIMATELY HOW

01:23:04.946 --> 01:23:06.381
MUCH IS GOING TO THE UNIVERSITY

01:23:06.448 --> 01:23:10.185
CALIFORNIA -- WELL A THROUGH.

01:23:10.251 --> 01:23:11.419
THE STATE GENERAL FUND SUPPORT

01:23:11.486 --> 01:23:13.588
FOR FINANCIAL AID I EXITED THE

01:23:13.655 --> 01:23:15.924
EXACT FIGURE I DON'T HAVE -- THE

01:23:15.990 --> 01:23:17.359
S. WHEN I COULD GIVE YOU BASED

01:23:17.425 --> 01:23:19.361
ON NUMBERS I'VE SEEN PREVIOUSLY.

01:23:19.427 --> 01:23:20.495
THAT'S HONOR MILLION.

01:23:20.562 --> 01:23:21.730
I'M SURE A LOT SEVEN HUNDRED

01:23:21.796 --> 01:23:22.997
MILLION SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION

01:23:23.064 --> 01:23:24.766
OKAY SEVEN PLUS THE MIDDLE CLASS

01:23:24.833 --> 01:23:27.135
SCHOLARSHIP WHICH IS MAYBE CLOSE

01:23:27.202 --> 01:23:28.703
TO A HUNDRED MILLION YEAH LET ME.

01:23:28.770 --> 01:23:29.771
GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT I WOULD

01:23:29.838 --> 01:23:31.106
SAY THREE QUARTERS OF A BILLION

01:23:31.172 --> 01:23:33.842
DOLLARS IS IS WHAT WE'VE TALKED

01:23:33.908 --> 01:23:36.111
ABOUT LAST COUPLE YEARS.

01:23:36.177 --> 01:23:39.647
SO YOU SO GET GIVEN THAT -- THE

01:23:39.714 --> 01:23:41.649
THE THE THE STATE TO IN MY

01:23:41.716 --> 01:23:43.318
OPINION SHOULD BE CREDITED -- I

01:23:43.385 --> 01:23:46.988
MEAN THAT THAT THAT IS A SUPPORT --

01:23:47.055 --> 01:23:56.164
FOR A YOU SEE -- STUDENTS -- IN

01:23:56.231 --> 01:23:59.100
IN TERMS OF THIS -- THIS THE

01:23:59.167 --> 01:24:00.535
PICTURE THAT THE THE STATE

01:24:00.602 --> 01:24:02.036
FUNDING AT LEAST SAID AS THE

01:24:02.103 --> 01:24:03.705
UNIVERSE A CALIFORNIA PRESENTS

01:24:03.772 --> 01:24:05.874
AT THE STATE FUNDING FOR THE UC --

01:24:05.940 --> 01:24:09.644
DROPPED FROM 72% 237%.

01:24:09.711 --> 01:24:10.845
IF IF YOU WERE TO TAKE IN

01:24:10.912 --> 01:24:13.748
ACCOUNT -- THE STATE'S FINANCIAL

01:24:13.815 --> 01:24:15.717
AID CONTRIBUTION -- HOW WOULD

01:24:15.784 --> 01:24:17.852
YOU ADJUST TO THAT THAT DECLINE

01:24:17.919 --> 01:24:19.888
IN STATE FUNDING?

01:24:19.954 --> 01:24:21.022
WELL I'M NOT SURE I HAVE THAT

01:24:21.089 --> 01:24:23.124
ANNOUNCES PREPARED BUT THE STATE

01:24:23.191 --> 01:24:24.759
BUDGET IN THE CURRENT YEAR IS IS

01:24:24.826 --> 01:24:25.960
IN THE STATE ECONOMY IS VERY

01:24:26.027 --> 01:24:27.462
DIFFERENT THAN THE STATE OF

01:24:27.529 --> 01:24:29.063
CALIFORNIA IN.

01:24:29.130 --> 01:24:30.698
TWO THOUSAND AND OF THE LAST

01:24:30.765 --> 01:24:33.635
TWENTY YEARS FAN A STRUGGLE

01:24:33.701 --> 01:24:35.170
BUDGETARY LEE PARTICULARLY IN

01:24:35.236 --> 01:24:36.971
THE INTO THE PAST RECESSIONS.

01:24:37.038 --> 01:24:38.940
AND WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT WE

01:24:39.007 --> 01:24:40.041
ARE ABLE TO MAINTAIN OUR

01:24:40.108 --> 01:24:40.608
COMMITMENTS BOTH NOW IN THE

01:24:40.675 --> 01:24:41.609
FUTURE.

01:24:41.676 --> 01:24:44.412
AND STRUCTURALLY TRYING TO

01:24:44.479 --> 01:24:45.814
RETURN.

01:24:45.880 --> 01:24:47.015
TO AREAS OF OF FUNDING WHERE WE

01:24:47.081 --> 01:24:48.783
HAD A MUCH STRONGER.

01:24:48.850 --> 01:24:51.653
REVENUE BASE -- WOULD BE TRUE

01:24:51.719 --> 01:24:54.656
DIFFICULT TO O CURRENTLY.

01:24:54.722 --> 01:24:57.358
IS IN A FACT THAT. FOR THE LAST.

01:24:57.425 --> 01:25:00.161
EIGHT YEARS WE'VE HAD.

01:25:00.228 --> 01:25:01.763
DISTRAUGHT BAKED CONSISTENT

01:25:01.830 --> 01:25:03.331
ECONOMIC GROWTH RECOVERY WITH

01:25:12.040 --> 01:25:12.907
RECEIVED.

01:25:12.974 --> 01:25:14.476
LIKELY THE LARGEST INFUSION OF

01:25:14.542 --> 01:25:16.878
ONGOING GENERAL FUND SUPPORT

01:25:16.945 --> 01:25:17.879

MARTUCCI.

01:27:25.273 --> 01:27:26.708
I THINK THAT YOU.

01:27:26.774 --> 01:27:28.710
A RAISED THAT A FEW ISSUES THAT

01:27:28.776 --> 01:27:30.945
WE NEED TO ALWAYS KEEP.

01:27:31.012 --> 01:27:33.014
KEEP OUR EYES ON THE PRIZE ABOUT.

01:27:33.081 --> 01:27:34.849
AND THAT'S JUST THE OVERALL.

01:27:34.916 --> 01:27:36.718
HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING AND IT

01:27:36.784 --> 01:27:37.819
IS SOMEWHAT.

01:27:37.885 --> 01:27:38.720
FRANKLY HONEST WITH THE U.

01:27:38.786 --> 01:27:40.688
DEPRESSING THAT IN THE LAST FIVE

01:27:40.755 --> 01:27:44.425
YEARS SEVEN YEARS AND FIVE FIVE

01:27:44.492 --> 01:27:46.094
SEVEN CAM FUNNY -- TRACK RECORD

01:27:46.160 --> 01:27:46.861
FOR YOU IT TEARS UP A YOU'VE

01:27:46.928 --> 01:27:48.896
BEEN HERE -- IN THE ERA WHEN

01:27:48.963 --> 01:27:52.233
WE'VE INVESTED OVER A BILLION

01:27:52.300 --> 01:27:53.601
DOLLARS MORE. FOR THE UNIVERSITY

01:27:53.668 --> 01:27:55.770
OF CALIFORNIA AND IT'S OBVIOUSLY

01:27:55.837 --> 01:27:57.739
NOT NEARLY ENOUGH AND I THINK

01:27:57.805 --> 01:27:58.539
ONE OF THE REALITY CHECKS IS

01:27:58.606 --> 01:28:00.208
THAT WE DO MOST LIKELY HAVE A

01:28:00.274 --> 01:28:01.776
DOWNTURN COMING.

01:28:01.843 --> 01:28:03.945
AND AND EVEN DURING THESE GOOD

01:28:04.012 --> 01:28:05.813
TIMES WE HAVEN'T KEPT UP THE

01:28:05.880 --> 01:28:07.382
THIS YEAR THERE'S NOT.

01:28:07.448 --> 01:28:10.251
MONEY AND THE BUDGET TO ENROLL

01:28:10.318 --> 01:28:11.853
ONE NEW CALIFORNIA STUDENT I

01:28:11.919 --> 01:28:13.488
KNOW THIS MONEY TO FOR PRIOR

01:28:13.554 --> 01:28:15.390
YEARS COMMITMENTS BUT THAT'S

01:28:15.456 --> 01:28:16.724
WHAT WE GET IN OUR COMMUNITIES

01:28:16.791 --> 01:28:18.626
ALL THE TIME WE TALK ABOUT THE

01:28:18.693 --> 01:28:19.627
NEXT ITEM THAT.

01:28:19.694 --> 01:28:21.496
PEOPLE COME OUT SAY MY KID MY

01:28:21.562 --> 01:28:23.598
NEIGHBOR MY NEPHEW SOMEBODY WE

01:28:23.665 --> 01:28:26.434
NOW AS A FOUR POINT THREE GPA

01:28:26.501 --> 01:28:28.469
PLAYED UCLA YOU SEE IRVINE UC

01:28:28.536 --> 01:28:30.138
BERKELEY AND THEY CAN'T GET IN

01:28:30.204 --> 01:28:31.973
THEY HAVE TO GO OUT OF STATE.

01:28:32.040 --> 01:28:32.540
WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO EXPAND

01:28:32.607 --> 01:28:36.210
ACCESS FOR CALIFORNIA KIDS

01:28:36.277 --> 01:28:37.445
CALIFORNIA KIDS?

01:28:37.512 --> 01:28:38.713
AND WE DON'T HAVE A REALLY GOOD

01:28:38.780 --> 01:28:40.415
ANSWER FOR THEM.

01:28:40.481 --> 01:28:42.316
AND SO THESE THE WHOLE NOTION

01:28:42.383 --> 01:28:44.118
ABOUT THESE COST DRIVERS WHICH

01:28:44.185 --> 01:28:46.254
GOVERNOR BROWN TALKED ABOUT FOR

01:28:46.320 --> 01:28:47.822
YEARS IS SOMETHING WE NEED TO GO

01:28:47.889 --> 01:28:49.357
BACK TO BECAUSE THIS CURRENT

01:28:49.424 --> 01:28:51.559
MODEL IS NOT SUSTAINABLE IT'S A

01:28:51.626 --> 01:28:52.360
HOUSE OF CARDS.

01:28:52.427 --> 01:28:55.096
I CAN 1100% THAT WERE NOT.

01:28:55.163 --> 01:28:57.298
STEPPING UP WHEN IT COMES TO TO

01:28:57.365 --> 01:28:59.200
FUNDING HIGHER ED LIKE WE USED

01:28:59.267 --> 01:29:01.069
TO AS FAR AS THE PERCENT OF OF

01:29:01.135 --> 01:29:03.571
THE BUDGET -- YOU CAN'T JUST GO

01:29:03.638 --> 01:29:05.073
BACK IN TIME ALL WE CAN DO IS GO

01:29:05.139 --> 01:29:06.207
FORWARD.

01:29:06.274 --> 01:29:08.176
AND AND WITH THAT I THINK THAT

01:29:08.242 --> 01:29:09.210
WE HAVE TO REALIZE THAT WE DO

01:29:09.277 --> 01:29:13.014
PUT OTHERS AS YOU SAID -- JACK

01:29:13.081 --> 01:29:14.449
I'M SORRY LAST IMMIGRANTS

01:29:14.515 --> 01:29:16.050
FORGETS WALLED SWELLED YES -- WE

01:29:16.117 --> 01:29:18.252
DO HAVE TO CHECKS THAT WE GIVE

01:29:18.319 --> 01:29:19.854
THE UC ESSENTIALLY WE GIVE THE

01:29:19.921 --> 01:29:21.389
GENERAL FUND JACK AND THEN.

01:29:21.456 --> 01:29:23.991
THE CHECK ITS WAY TAXPAYER MONEY --

01:29:24.058 --> 01:29:26.160
FROM THE CAL GRANT PROGRAM WHICH

01:29:26.227 --> 01:29:27.795
IS YOU KNOW THREE QUARTERS OF

01:29:27.862 --> 01:29:29.664
BILLION DOLLARS SO I DON'T THINK

01:29:29.731 --> 01:29:30.798
WE CAN IT DOLLARS IT TAKES A NOR

01:29:30.865 --> 01:29:31.632
THAT.

01:29:31.699 --> 01:29:33.468
BUT EVEN THOSE THE COMBINED I

01:29:33.534 --> 01:29:35.203
WOULD I WOULD -- PROBABLY SEE

01:29:35.269 --> 01:29:36.537
PLATE YOU SAID MR MURATSUCHI

01:29:36.604 --> 01:29:38.406
THAT THE PERCENTAGE THEY WERE

01:29:38.473 --> 01:29:40.308
PUTTING INTO OVERALL HIRED

01:29:40.374 --> 01:29:43.144
FUNDING THROUGH UC'S PROBABLY AS

01:29:43.211 --> 01:29:45.646
A PERCENTAGE OF OF OF THE BUDGET --

01:29:45.713 --> 01:29:47.682
NOT WHERE WE WERE NOT WHERE WE

01:29:47.749 --> 01:29:49.584
WE'RE WHERE WE SHOULD BE -- BUT

01:29:49.650 --> 01:29:55.890
WE HAVE A REALITY -- LIMITED --

01:29:55.957 --> 01:29:57.225
FOUGHT FUNDS HERE FOR US ALL

01:29:57.291 --> 01:29:59.694
THIS PROPOSALS RIGHT HERE THERE --

01:29:59.761 --> 01:30:01.129
IT'S ONE TIME IN THE MAY REVISE.

01:30:01.195 --> 01:30:02.830
SO WE NEED TO GO BACK TO THIS

01:30:02.897 --> 01:30:05.233
THIS NOTION OF THAT THE COST

01:30:05.299 --> 01:30:08.836
DRIVERS BECAUSE THE YEAR AFTER

01:30:08.903 --> 01:30:09.904

UNIVERSITY I'M NOT DIMINISHING

01:30:11.139 --> 01:30:12.707
IT BUT WHEN YOU WANT THREE AND%

01:30:12.774 --> 01:30:15.376
4% -- GROWTH EVERY YEAR IT JUST

01:30:15.443 --> 01:30:17.178
COVERS THE BASICS YEAR.

01:30:17.245 --> 01:30:19.714
YOUR COST FOR FACULTY IN YOUR

01:30:19.781 --> 01:30:21.616
DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AND YOU AND

01:30:21.682 --> 01:30:23.050
JUST THE THE COR STUFF AND

01:30:23.117 --> 01:30:24.252
DOESN'T EVEN GET TO THE ISSUES

01:30:24.318 --> 01:30:24.719
THAT.

01:30:24.786 --> 01:30:26.454
ARE CONSTITUENTS TALK TO US

01:30:26.521 --> 01:30:29.257
ABOUT -- AND YOU KNOW THAT

01:30:29.323 --> 01:30:31.325
DOESN'T ADD UP AND IT'S INTO A

01:30:31.392 --> 01:30:33.261
SHOULD BE A STARK WARNING THAT

01:30:33.327 --> 01:30:34.462
AGAIN WHO HAD FIVE YEARS IN A

01:30:34.529 --> 01:30:35.329

01:30:40.835 --> 01:30:42.136
IN GENERAL FUND.

01:30:42.203 --> 01:30:45.139
IN THE LAST -- SINCE TWO

01:40:50.377 --> 01:40:51.645
FRESHMEN STUDENTS TO NO MORE

01:40:51.712 --> 01:40:52.913
THAN 10%.

01:40:52.980 --> 01:40:54.047
OF THE FRESHMAN CLASS AT EVERY

01:40:54.114 --> 01:40:56.483
UC CAMPUS BY THE TWENTY TWENTY

01:40:56.550 --> 01:40:59.286
NINE THIRTY ACADEMIC YEAR.

01:40:59.353 --> 01:41:00.120
I BELIEVE YOU HAVE A HAND UP

01:41:00.187 --> 01:41:02.890
TODAY THAT'LL BE REFERENCING --

01:41:02.956 --> 01:41:03.957
ON SLIDE TO MY COMMENTS TODAY

01:41:04.024 --> 01:41:05.058
WILL FOCUS ON THE ESTIMATED

01:41:05.125 --> 01:41:07.227
FINANCIAL IMPACT OF REDUCING NON

01:41:07.294 --> 01:41:08.629
RESIDENT ENROLLMENT.

01:41:08.695 --> 01:41:09.963
I DO NOT MEAN TO DISCOUNT THE

01:41:10.030 --> 01:41:11.432
EDUCATIONAL BENEFITS OF LEARNING

01:41:11.498 --> 01:41:13.367
AND LIVING ALONGSIDE STUDENTS

01:41:13.434 --> 01:41:14.001
FROM OTHER STATES COUNTRIES AND

01:41:14.067 --> 01:41:14.935
CULTURES.

01:41:15.002 --> 01:41:16.003
BUT THE FINANCIAL ASPECTS OF THE

01:41:16.069 --> 01:41:18.105
PROPOSAL SEEM MOST RELEVANT TO

01:41:18.172 --> 01:41:18.806
THIS COMMITTEES DISCUSSIONS

01:41:18.872 --> 01:41:20.808
TODAY.

01:41:20.874 --> 01:41:21.442
AND REALLY ARE THE FOCUS OF THE

01:41:21.508 --> 01:41:22.543
REPORT.

01:41:22.609 --> 01:41:24.011
WE LOOK AT FOR AREAS A FINANCIAL

01:41:24.077 --> 01:41:25.546
IMPACT.

01:41:25.612 --> 01:41:26.213
FIRST THE ADDITIONAL STATE

01:41:26.280 --> 01:41:27.748
FUNDING THAT WOULD BE REQUIRED

01:41:27.815 --> 01:41:29.483
TO SUPPORT HIGHER LEVELS OF

01:41:29.550 --> 01:41:31.351
CALIFORNIA RESIDENT ENROLLMENT.

01:41:31.418 --> 01:41:32.219
TO FILL THE SEATS THAT WOULD

01:41:32.286 --> 01:41:33.086
BECOME VACANT.

01:41:33.153 --> 01:41:34.588
AS NON RESIDENT ENROLLMENT

01:41:34.655 --> 01:41:35.889
DECLINES.

01:41:35.956 --> 01:41:37.324
WE ASSUME THAT'S KEY TO THIS

01:41:37.391 --> 01:41:39.059
PROPOSED POLICY THAT THE GOAL IS

01:41:39.126 --> 01:41:40.727
NOT TO REDUCE NON RESIDENT

01:41:40.794 --> 01:41:42.296
ENROLLMENT FOR ITS OWN SAKE.

01:41:42.362 --> 01:41:43.897
BUT TO DO SO IN ORDER TO ENROLL

01:41:43.964 --> 01:41:45.599
EVEN MORE CALIFORNIA RESIDENT

01:41:45.666 --> 01:41:47.167
STUDENTS.

01:41:47.234 --> 01:41:48.202
SECOND WE ESTIMATE THE REVENUE

01:41:48.268 --> 01:41:49.536
FROM NON RESIDENT TUITION THAT

01:41:49.603 --> 01:41:50.804
WOULD NEED TO BE REPLACED UNDER

01:41:50.871 --> 01:41:51.505
THE SCENARIO.

01:41:51.572 --> 01:41:52.639
AFTER TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE

01:41:52.706 --> 01:41:54.141
ADDITIONAL SUPPORT FOR

01:41:54.208 --> 01:41:54.775
CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS THAT I JUST

01:41:54.842 --> 01:41:56.477
MENTIONED.

01:41:56.543 --> 01:41:58.078
WE ALSO EXPECT INCREASED DEMAND

01:41:58.145 --> 01:41:59.613
FOR FINANCIAL AID FROM UC'S ON

01:41:59.680 --> 01:42:00.981
INSTITUTIONAL IN PROGRAM.

01:42:01.048 --> 01:42:02.115
SINCE NON RESIDENTS WERE

01:42:02.182 --> 01:42:03.650
INELIGIBLE FOR YOU SEE GRANTS

01:42:03.717 --> 01:42:04.718
WOULD BE REPLACED BY NEW

01:42:04.785 --> 01:42:06.320
CALIFORNIA STUDENTS.

01:42:06.386 --> 01:42:08.388
WHO LIKE OUR CURRENT STUDENTS

01:42:08.455 --> 01:42:10.357
OFTEN RELY ON YOU SEE GRANTS TO

01:42:10.424 --> 01:42:11.625
FINANCE THEIR EDUCATION?

01:42:11.692 --> 01:42:12.326
FINALLY IN ROLLING MORE

01:42:12.392 --> 01:42:13.293
CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS WITH

01:42:13.360 --> 01:42:14.294
FINANCIAL NEED WOULD ALSO

01:42:14.361 --> 01:42:15.562
INCREASE AWARDS FROM THE STATE'S

01:42:15.629 --> 01:42:17.898
CAL GRANT PROGRAM.

01:42:17.965 --> 01:42:19.566
I DISPLAY THREE SHOWS THE

01:42:19.633 --> 01:42:21.468
COMBINED MAGNITUDE OF THE FISCAL

01:42:21.535 --> 01:42:23.136
IMPACT OF REDUCING NONRESIDENT

01:42:23.203 --> 01:42:24.705
ENROLLMENT.

01:42:24.771 --> 01:42:26.540
IN EACH OF THE NEXT TEN YEARS.

01:42:26.607 --> 01:42:28.008
IN THE FIRST YEAR AS YOU CAN SEE

01:42:28.075 --> 01:42:29.309
THE COMBINED IMPACT WOULD BE

01:42:29.376 --> 01:42:30.611
RELATIVELY SMALL.

01:42:30.677 --> 01:42:32.179
ABOUT EIGHTEEN MILLION DOLLARS.

01:42:32.246 --> 01:42:33.580
BUT WOULD QUICKLY GROW AND WOULD

01:42:33.647 --> 01:42:35.349
ADD ABOUT ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN

01:42:35.415 --> 01:42:39.253
NEW FUNDING NEEDS BY THE YEAR --

01:42:39.319 --> 01:42:39.853
TWENTY NINE TWENTY TWENTY NINE

01:42:39.920 --> 01:42:40.487
THIRTY THE CUMULATIVE COST OF

01:42:40.554 --> 01:42:42.122
THE TEN YEAR PERIOD WOULD EXCEED

01:42:42.189 --> 01:42:44.491
FOUR POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS.

01:42:44.558 --> 01:42:45.025
I WANT TO NOTE THAT THESE

01:42:45.092 --> 01:42:46.927
FIGURES ARE IN ADDITION TO THE

01:42:46.994 --> 01:42:48.128
STATE FUNDING NEEDED FOR CATS

01:42:48.195 --> 01:42:49.696
Và HORNET RESIDENT ENROLLMENT

01:42:49.763 --> 01:42:50.330
GROWTH.

01:42:50.397 --> 01:42:53.233
THAT WE ARE ALREADY ASSUMING

01:42:53.300 --> 01:42:54.701
EVEN WITHOUT THIS POLICY CHANGE.

01:42:54.768 --> 01:42:56.203
IN NINETEEN TWENTY AS YOU KNOW

01:42:56.270 --> 01:42:57.371
WE ARE REQUESTING TWENTY EIGHT

01:42:57.437 --> 01:42:58.272
MILLION DOLLARS A TREATABLE TO

01:42:58.338 --> 01:43:00.807
CALIFORNIA ENROLLMENT GROWTH OF

01:43:00.874 --> 01:43:01.909
TWENTY FIVE CALIFORNIA RESIDENT

01:43:01.975 --> 01:43:03.677
UNDERGRADUATES NEXT YEAR THAT'S

01:43:03.744 --> 01:43:04.244
BUILT INTO A NINETEEN TWENTY

01:43:04.311 --> 01:43:05.412
PLAN.

01:43:05.479 --> 01:43:06.813
I'D LIKE TO NOW DESCRIBE SOME OF

01:43:06.880 --> 01:43:09.016
THE PROJECTIONS FOR ENROLLMENT

01:43:09.082 --> 01:43:09.650
FOR TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND FUTURE

01:43:09.716 --> 01:43:10.183
YEARS THAT UNDERLIE THESE

01:43:10.250 --> 01:43:12.486
ESTIMATES.

01:43:12.553 --> 01:43:13.987
TURNING TO SLIDE.

01:43:14.054 --> 01:43:15.789
FOR A TO DEVELOP THE ESTIMATES

01:43:15.856 --> 01:43:19.593
THAT YOU SEE HERE -- WE COMPARED

01:43:19.660 --> 01:43:21.595
ESTIMATED IN ROMANS AGAINST A

01:43:21.662 --> 01:43:23.130
BASE CASE ENROLLMENTS AREA.

01:43:23.196 --> 01:43:24.131
THAT WE THINK REPRESENTS A

01:43:24.197 --> 01:43:25.198
REASONABLE LEVEL OF ENROLLMENT

01:43:25.265 --> 01:43:26.500
GROWTH TO EXPECT OVER THE NEXT

01:43:26.567 --> 01:43:27.568
TEN YEARS.

01:43:27.634 --> 01:43:29.002
IT IS BY NECESSITY AN ESTIMATE

01:43:29.069 --> 01:43:31.238
SINCE CAMPUS DO NOT HAVE FULLY

01:43:31.305 --> 01:43:31.805
DEVELOPED TENURE ENROLLMENT

01:43:31.872 --> 01:43:32.506
PLANS.

01:43:32.573 --> 01:43:33.840
SO WHAT WE DID WAS WE ASSUMED AN

01:43:33.907 --> 01:43:35.809
ANNUAL INCREASE OF ABOUT 1% IN

01:43:35.876 --> 01:43:37.644
CALIFORNIA AND ROMAN ACROSS THE

01:43:37.711 --> 01:43:38.912
SYSTEM EACH YEAR.

01:43:38.979 --> 01:43:40.314
DISTRIBUTED ACROSS CAMPUS IS

01:43:40.380 --> 01:43:42.015
BASED ON RECENT GROWTH TRENDS.

01:43:42.082 --> 01:43:43.250
WE ALSO SING THE CAMPUSES WOULD

01:43:43.317 --> 01:43:45.152
MAINTAIN A TWO TO ONE FRESHMEN

01:43:45.218 --> 01:43:46.019
TO TRANSFER RATIO AMONG NEW

01:43:46.086 --> 01:43:46.853
STUDENTS.

01:43:46.920 --> 01:43:48.155
AND THAT NON RESIDENT ENROLLMENT

01:43:48.221 --> 01:43:49.489
WOULD INCREASE GRADUALLY AMONG

01:43:49.556 --> 01:43:51.158
CAMPUSES THAT HAVEN'T ALREADY

01:43:51.224 --> 01:43:52.059
HITTHEIR NON RESIDENT

01:43:52.125 --> 01:43:54.328
ENROLLMENT CAP UNDER A REGION'S

01:43:54.394 --> 01:43:55.862
POLICY.

01:43:55.929 --> 01:43:56.730
WE CAN COMPARE THAT BASE CASE

01:43:56.797 --> 01:43:59.032
SCENARIO AGAINST A 10% SCENARIO

01:43:59.099 --> 01:44:00.901
WERE NEW NONRESIDENT FRESHMAN

01:44:00.968 --> 01:44:03.503
GRADUALLY FALL 210% OF INCOMING

01:44:03.570 --> 01:44:07.608
FRESHMEN BY.

01:44:07.674 --> 01:44:08.375
TWENTY NINE DISPLAY FIVE SHOWS

01:44:08.442 --> 01:44:10.110
THE ROMAN PROJECTIONS THAT

01:44:10.177 --> 01:44:11.678
RESULT UNDER BOTH AREAS.

01:44:11.745 --> 01:44:12.879
UNDER THE BASE CASE SCENARIO

01:44:12.946 --> 01:44:14.948
FROM FIRST YOU CAN SEE THAT

01:44:15.015 --> 01:44:16.516
TOTAL RESIDENT ENROLLMENT.

01:44:16.583 --> 01:44:18.719
PROS FOR ABOUT A HUNDRED AND

01:44:18.785 --> 01:44:20.187
TWENTY TWO THOUSAND STUDENTS IN.

01:44:20.253 --> 01:44:21.588
TWENTY TWENTY ONE TO ABOUT A

01:44:21.655 --> 01:44:22.623
HUNDRED NINETY NINE THOUSAND AND

01:44:22.689 --> 01:44:24.825
TWENTY NINE THIRTY A GROWTH OF

01:44:24.891 --> 01:44:25.325
ABOUT SEVENTEEN THOUSAND

01:44:25.392 --> 01:44:26.593
STUDENTS.

01:44:26.660 --> 01:44:28.061
YOU'RE ON THAT DISPLAY FIVE

01:44:28.128 --> 01:44:29.463
DISPLAY FIVE THAT'S RIGHT YOU'LL

01:44:29.529 --> 01:44:31.298
SEE THE THAT THE TOP PART BASE

01:44:31.365 --> 01:44:32.799
CASE THERE'S A SECTION THERE FOR

01:44:32.866 --> 01:44:34.201
TOTAL ENROLLMENT.

01:44:34.267 --> 01:44:35.402
AND YOU CAN SEE THE CATTLE

01:44:35.469 --> 01:44:36.937
CALIFORNIA RESIDENT CORRECT

01:44:37.004 --> 01:44:39.039
COMING FROM.

01:44:39.106 --> 01:44:39.606
ONE NINETY TWO TO ONE NINETY

01:44:39.673 --> 01:44:40.474
NINE UNDER THE 10% IN ARE YOU

01:44:40.540 --> 01:44:41.141
FROM BELOW.

01:44:41.208 --> 01:44:44.111
NON RESIDENTS DECLINE FROM 19%.

01:44:44.177 --> 01:44:45.579
OF THE INCOMING FRESHMEN CLASS

01:44:45.646 --> 01:44:49.716
IN. 2021210% AND TWENTY NINE

01:44:49.783 --> 01:44:50.784
THIRTY UNDER THIS SCENARIO TOTAL

01:44:50.851 --> 01:44:52.285
CALIFORNIA RESIDENT CLOSE BY

01:44:52.352 --> 01:44:54.655
ABOUT THIRTY FOUR THOUSAND OVER

01:44:54.721 --> 01:44:55.622
THIS PERIOD.

01:44:55.689 --> 01:44:56.490
BUT AS WE SHOULD EARLIER THAT

01:44:56.556 --> 01:44:57.724
HIGHER GROWTH COMES AT A VERY

01:44:57.791 --> 01:44:59.092
SUBSTANTIAL POSSIBLE TALK A

01:44:59.159 --> 01:45:01.161
LITTLE BIT ABOUT MORE

01:45:01.228 --> 01:45:01.461
[inaudible]

01:45:01.528 --> 01:45:05.098
DISPLAY.

01:45:05.165 --> 01:45:07.367
SIX FOCUSES ON THAT CHANGE IN

01:45:07.434 --> 01:45:08.368
CALIFORNIA RESIDENT AND ROMAN

01:45:08.435 --> 01:45:10.070
UNDER BOTH SCENARIOS AND THE

01:45:10.137 --> 01:45:12.272
COST THE INCREMENTAL COST

01:45:12.339 --> 01:45:14.241
ASSOCIATED WITH THE 10%.

01:45:14.307 --> 01:45:15.142
ONE HERE YOU CAN SEE THE IMPACT

01:45:15.208 --> 01:45:16.610
OF THE 10% SCENARIO ON

01:45:16.677 --> 01:45:18.578
CALIFORNIAN ROMAN EACH YEAR

01:45:18.645 --> 01:45:19.680
COMPARED TO THE BASE CASE.

01:45:19.746 --> 01:45:22.049
SUGG THE BASE CASE IS GOING UP

01:45:22.115 --> 01:45:24.084
BY TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED A YEAR.

01:45:24.151 --> 01:45:24.885
ACTUALLY THE THE BASE CASES BYE

01:45:24.951 --> 01:45:26.853
BYE OVER THIS PERIOD WE SAID 1%

01:45:26.920 --> 01:45:27.087
A YEAR.

01:45:27.154 --> 01:45:29.456
WHAT'S THAT WHICH IS ABOUT

01:45:29.523 --> 01:45:29.990
NINETEEN HUNDRED OR SO ON

01:45:30.057 --> 01:45:30.390
AVERAGE.

01:45:30.457 --> 01:45:31.658
AND AGAIN THESE ARE BASED ON A

01:45:31.725 --> 01:45:33.894
REASONABLE PROJECTION NOT NOT ON

01:45:33.960 --> 01:45:37.230
CAMPUS SPECIFIC PLANS ADDRESS

01:45:37.297 --> 01:45:39.766
THOSE DON'T ACTUALLY EXIST.

01:45:39.833 --> 01:45:41.301
SO THAT'S THE BASE CASE -- THEN

01:45:41.368 --> 01:45:42.335
IF YOU LOOK AT THE ADDITIONAL

01:45:42.402 --> 01:45:44.171
AROMA THAT YOU SEE UNDER THE 10%

01:45:44.237 --> 01:45:45.906
SCENARIO -- YOU'LL SEE THAT IT

01:45:45.972 --> 01:45:46.540
GROWS EACH YEAR IT'S DROPS OFF

01:45:46.606 --> 01:45:48.475
RELATIVELY MODEST BUT IS A MUCH

01:45:48.542 --> 01:45:50.110
LARGER BY THE TIME YOU GET.

01:45:50.177 --> 01:45:50.777
TWENTY NINE THIRTY WE ALSO SHOW

01:45:50.844 --> 01:45:52.512
THEM THE ADDITIONAL COSTS OF

01:45:52.579 --> 01:45:54.081
THAT 10% SCENARIO AND IT HERE

01:45:54.147 --> 01:45:55.482
IT'S IMPORTANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT.

01:45:55.549 --> 01:45:57.684
THIS IS THE COST IN ADDITION TO

01:45:57.751 --> 01:45:59.052
THE ENROLLMENT GROWTH.

01:45:59.119 --> 01:46:01.388
AND BASS BUT ADJUSTMENTS THAT

01:46:01.455 --> 01:46:02.055
ARE ALREADY BUILT INTO THAT BASE

01:46:02.122 --> 01:46:02.723
CASE.

01:46:02.789 --> 01:46:05.125
THIS IS ON TOP OF THAT.

01:46:05.192 --> 01:46:05.959
ARE THE STATE WOULD NEED TO

01:46:06.026 --> 01:46:06.693
INVEST AND AND WE CAN BE

01:46:06.760 --> 01:46:08.128
BASICALLY LOOK AT WHAT IS THAT

01:46:08.195 --> 01:46:10.230
INCREMENTAL CALIFORNIAN ROMAN.

01:46:10.297 --> 01:46:11.832
THE FOUR HUNDRED FORTY THREE

01:46:11.898 --> 01:46:12.499
STUDENTS IN THE FIRST YEAR WHICH

01:46:12.566 --> 01:46:14.768
THEN GROWS. TO THE INCREMENTAL

01:46:14.835 --> 01:46:16.203
COST UNDER THE PLAN.

01:46:16.269 --> 01:46:17.003
AND YOU'LL SEE THAT THE STATE

01:46:17.070 --> 01:46:18.505
WOULD NEED TO INVEST ABOUT FORTY

01:46:18.572 --> 01:46:19.639
THOUSAND DOLLARS PER STUDENT AT

01:46:19.706 --> 01:46:20.774
THE START OF THE PLAN.

01:46:20.841 --> 01:46:22.542
RISING TO ALMOST FIFTY TWO

01:46:22.609 --> 01:46:23.477
THOUSAND BY THE END.

01:46:23.543 --> 01:46:25.078
THAT'S THE COMBINED IMPACT.

01:46:25.145 --> 01:46:26.847
OF THE MARGINAL COST OF IN

01:46:26.913 --> 01:46:28.315
ROWING ADDITIONAL CALIFORNIA

01:46:28.381 --> 01:46:29.316
STUDENTS.

01:46:29.382 --> 01:46:31.017
OF REPLACING THE LOS NONRESIDENT

01:46:31.084 --> 01:46:32.119
TUITION.

01:46:32.185 --> 01:46:33.320
AND FUNDING THE ADDITIONAL UC

01:46:33.386 --> 01:46:35.255
GRANTS AND CAL GRANTS TO

01:46:35.322 --> 01:46:35.856
PRESERVE AFFORDABILITY FOR THE

01:46:35.922 --> 01:46:36.723
STUDENTS.

01:46:36.790 --> 01:46:38.058
IF THE COST WERE NOT FULLY

01:46:38.125 --> 01:46:39.025
COVERED BY ADDITIONAL STATE

01:46:39.092 --> 01:46:39.993
SUPPORT THERE WOULD BE REAL

01:46:40.060 --> 01:46:41.461
NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES TO

01:46:41.528 --> 01:46:42.763
CAMPUSES AND STUDENTS.

01:46:42.829 --> 01:46:45.465
AS NOTED IN THE REPORT ITSELF

01:46:45.532 --> 01:46:46.767
NOT REPLACING THE LOST INTEREST

01:46:46.833 --> 01:46:48.201
HE REVENUE AT BERKELEY FOR

01:46:48.268 --> 01:46:49.436
EXAMPLE WOULD LEAVE THAT CAMPUS

01:46:49.503 --> 01:46:50.670
WITH ABOUT A HUNDRED AND TWENTY

01:46:50.737 --> 01:46:52.272
TWO MILLION DOLLAR SHORTFALL.

01:46:52.339 --> 01:46:53.807
IN TWENTY NINE THIRTY ALONE.

01:46:53.874 --> 01:46:55.041
THAT'S EQUIVALENT TO THE SALARY

01:46:55.108 --> 01:46:57.577
AND BENEFITS FOR SIX HUNDRED AND

01:46:57.644 --> 01:46:58.178
SEVENTY FIVE FULL TIME FACULTY

01:46:58.245 --> 01:46:59.146
POSITIONS.

01:46:59.212 --> 01:47:00.514
IF FUNDING WERE NOT PROVIDED FOR

01:47:00.580 --> 01:47:01.982
YOU SEE GRANTS FOR CAL GRANTS

01:47:02.048 --> 01:47:03.283
THE IMPACT WOULD BE FELT ON

01:47:03.350 --> 01:47:06.153
CALIFORNIA RESIDENT STUDENTS

01:47:06.219 --> 01:47:06.787
THROUGH HIGHER LEVELS OF STUDENT

01:47:06.853 --> 01:47:09.022
DEBT.

01:47:09.089 --> 01:47:09.689
I HOPE THAT PROVIDES A

01:47:09.756 --> 01:47:10.290
SUBCOMMITTEE WITH SOME HELPFUL

01:47:10.357 --> 01:47:10.957
INFORMATION ABOUT THE REPORT AND

01:47:11.024 --> 01:47:12.192
I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY

01:47:12.259 --> 01:47:15.195
QUESTIONS THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE.

01:47:15.262 --> 01:47:16.062
OKAY.

01:47:16.129 --> 01:47:18.431
SO ON THE SCENARIO OF COST PER

01:47:18.498 --> 01:47:20.534
STUDENT.

01:47:20.600 --> 01:47:21.968
SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT IN A FOR

01:47:22.035 --> 01:47:24.571
EVERY STUDENTS THAT WE DO THIS

01:47:24.638 --> 01:47:27.374
CHANGES ADDITIONAL. FORTY

01:47:27.440 --> 01:47:28.909
THOUSAND DOLLARS ROUGHLY THAT'S

01:47:28.975 --> 01:47:29.743
RIGHT YEAH.

01:47:29.810 --> 01:47:32.012
SO YOU SOMEONE SOMEONE PROBABLY

01:47:32.078 --> 01:47:33.847
THE FLIP SIDE THAT HE BE.

01:47:33.914 --> 01:47:35.515
YOU WOULD ARGUE BE BETTER OFF TO

01:47:35.582 --> 01:47:37.184
FOCUS ON THE EXISTING.

01:47:37.250 --> 01:47:39.753
KAPOR RATIO AND FUN ADDITIONAL

01:47:39.820 --> 01:47:40.921
CALIFORNIAN ROMAN CROSS YOU GET

01:47:40.987 --> 01:47:42.255
MORE BANG FOR YOUR BUCK YEAH I

01:47:42.322 --> 01:47:43.390
THINK THE QUESTION THIS THIS

01:47:43.456 --> 01:47:44.491
BEGS IS EXACTLY THAT SORT OF

01:47:44.558 --> 01:47:46.293
WHAT'S THE THE BEST USE FOR

01:47:46.359 --> 01:47:48.161
THOSE FUNDS -- IS IT TO FULLY

01:47:48.228 --> 01:47:49.729
FUND -- BETWEEN SURE THAT WE CAN

01:47:49.796 --> 01:47:51.364
FIND -- ADEQUATE LEVELS OF

01:47:51.431 --> 01:47:53.433
CALIFORNIAN GROWTH EVEN WITHOUT

01:47:53.500 --> 01:47:53.967
TO THIS REDUCTION AND NON

01:47:54.034 --> 01:47:55.569
RESIDENT STUDENTS -- IS IT TO

01:47:55.635 --> 01:47:56.503
HELP RESTORE SOME OF THE

01:47:56.570 --> 01:47:57.838
INDICATORS OF ACADEMIC QUALITY

01:47:57.904 --> 01:47:59.472
THAT WE'VE SEEN WHICH I KNOW

01:47:59.539 --> 01:48:00.040
HAVE BEEN PRESENTED TO THIS

01:48:00.106 --> 01:48:01.908
COMMITTEE BEFORE -- THINGS LIKE --

01:48:01.975 --> 01:48:03.443
DECLINING A STUDENT SATISFACTION

01:48:03.510 --> 01:48:04.511
WITH THEIR EXPERIENCE THAT YOU

01:48:04.578 --> 01:48:06.146
SEE INCREASED DIFFICULTY IN

01:48:06.213 --> 01:48:07.314
GETTING TO THE MAJORS THAT THEY

01:48:07.380 --> 01:48:07.747
WANT.

01:48:07.814 --> 01:48:09.549
OTHER ISSUES WAS RELATED TO

01:48:09.616 --> 01:48:13.420
ACADEMIC -- SUPPORT AND

01:48:13.486 --> 01:48:14.821
THROUGHPUT AND STUDENT SUCCESS

01:48:14.888 --> 01:48:16.590
SO THERE'S ONE I THINK FLYING

01:48:16.656 --> 01:48:17.924
ALL THIS IS WE NEED AS WE KNOW.

01:48:17.991 --> 01:48:19.860
WE DO HEAR FROM EXISTING YOU SEE

01:48:19.926 --> 01:48:21.494
STUDENTS COME UP HERE AND SAY

01:48:21.561 --> 01:48:23.730
HEY IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT GETTING.

01:48:23.797 --> 01:48:24.698
MY LITTLE SISTER IN THE SEATS

01:48:24.764 --> 01:48:26.766
ABOUT MAKING SURE I HAVE A PLACE

01:48:26.833 --> 01:48:27.901
TO GO STUDY AND I CAN GET MY

01:48:27.968 --> 01:48:29.536
COURSE OFFERING AND I HAVE A

01:48:29.603 --> 01:48:31.304
PLACE TO LIVE AND ALL JUST TO

01:48:31.371 --> 01:48:33.006
JUST THE BASICS AND SO.

01:48:33.073 --> 01:48:34.908
THE CURRENT POLICY WE HAVE THIS --

01:48:34.975 --> 01:48:36.610
SO CALLED CAP IT'S REALLY A

01:48:36.676 --> 01:48:38.845
RATIO SO IT'S THAT ONE TO FOUR

01:48:38.912 --> 01:48:41.715
RATIO FOR EVERY. 20% REQUEST

01:48:41.781 --> 01:48:44.150
RATIO SO FOR EVERYONE -- NON

01:48:44.217 --> 01:48:47.387
RESIDENT YOU NEED TO ENROLL --

01:48:47.454 --> 01:48:49.489
FOR CALIFORNIA KIDS RIGHT CENTER

01:48:49.556 --> 01:48:50.490
THAT'S THE MATH RIGHT YEAH AND

01:48:50.557 --> 01:48:52.926
SO -- THAT DIDN'T DIDN'T THE

01:48:52.993 --> 01:48:54.494
NOTION.

01:48:54.561 --> 01:48:56.263
OF THAT IN IN YOUR ARGUING FOR

01:48:56.329 --> 01:48:58.198
THE UC I WOULD THINK THAT NOW WE

01:48:58.265 --> 01:48:59.432
SHOULD JUST CONTINUE THE CURRENT

01:48:59.499 --> 01:49:01.034
POLICY.

01:49:01.101 --> 01:49:02.836
AND FIND MORE ENROLLMENT GROWTH.

01:49:02.903 --> 01:49:04.471
BUT THAT -- ASSUMES THAT THERE

01:49:04.537 --> 01:49:06.806
IS CAPACITY TO CONTINUE TO GROW

01:49:06.873 --> 01:49:10.176
AND AND AND THIS POLICY.

01:49:10.243 --> 01:49:11.711
WOULD WOULD WOULD DEAL WITH THE

01:49:11.778 --> 01:49:13.513
PHYSICAL SPACE ISSUE RIGHT

01:49:13.580 --> 01:49:15.982
BECAUSE THE REGARDLESS OF MONEY

01:49:16.049 --> 01:49:17.183
THERE'S A DOES THAT JUST A NOTE

01:49:17.250 --> 01:49:18.518
HOW MNY SEATS YOU HAVE IN THIS.

01:49:18.585 --> 01:49:20.020
IN THIS ROOM RIGHT NOW RIGHT.

01:49:20.086 --> 01:49:21.388
AND SO.

01:49:21.454 --> 01:49:22.789
DOES THAT TAKEN TO CONSIDER THAT

01:49:22.856 --> 01:49:24.057
TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THAT

01:49:24.124 --> 01:49:25.125
ISSUE.

01:49:25.191 --> 01:49:26.760
WELL YES I THINK IT DOES SORT OF

01:49:26.826 --> 01:49:27.861
RAISE THE QUESTION OF WHAT'S THE

01:49:27.928 --> 01:49:29.629
MOST EFFECTIVE LONG TERM WAY TO

01:49:29.696 --> 01:49:30.563
DEAL WITH SPACE CONSTRAINTS AT

01:49:30.630 --> 01:49:32.198
THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA.

01:49:32.265 --> 01:49:33.800
IS IT TO ADDITIONAL NON RESIDENT

01:49:33.867 --> 01:49:41.041
STUDENTS AND THEIR BY CREATING

01:49:41.107 --> 01:49:41.608
SOME SPACE WITH AN EXISTING

01:49:41.675 --> 01:49:42.676
FACILITY.

01:49:42.742 --> 01:49:43.643
WITH THEIR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE

01:49:43.710 --> 01:49:45.045
ISSUES WITH THEIR SIZE MATTRESS

01:49:45.111 --> 01:49:46.079
AT CETERA UP OR IS IT TO INVEST

01:49:46.146 --> 01:49:47.013
IN LONG TERM GROWTH OF

01:49:47.080 --> 01:49:47.647
FACILITIES THROUGH WHETHER IT'S

01:49:47.714 --> 01:49:48.248
A GENERAL OBLIGATION BOND OR

01:49:48.315 --> 01:49:48.882
JUST SUPPORT FOR THE UNIVERSITY

01:49:48.949 --> 01:49:49.482
TO BE ABLE TO MAKE SOME OF ITS

01:49:49.549 --> 01:49:50.417
OWN CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS AND

01:49:50.483 --> 01:49:50.717
EXPANSION.

01:49:50.784 --> 01:49:52.152
USING THE AB NINETY FOUR PROCESS

01:49:52.218 --> 01:49:53.853
UP IF IF WE THINK SORT OF

01:49:53.920 --> 01:49:54.621
STRATEGICALLY NOT JUST DURING

01:49:54.688 --> 01:49:55.956
THIS TEN YEAR PERIOD BUT EVEN

01:49:56.022 --> 01:49:57.991
BEYOND UP WHAT'S THE RIGHT LONG

01:49:58.058 --> 01:49:58.959
TERM WAY TO ADDRESS WHAT WILL BE

01:49:59.025 --> 01:50:01.127
LONG TERM NEEDS AROUND CAPACITY

01:50:01.194 --> 01:50:02.295
AT THE UNIVERSITY.

01:50:02.362 --> 01:50:04.197
AND THEN I REALIZE THAT -- YOU

01:50:04.264 --> 01:50:05.632
KNOW I I WOULD LIKE NOTHING MORE

01:50:05.699 --> 01:50:07.600
THAN TO TO DO THIS TO GO BACK TO

01:50:07.667 --> 01:50:09.002
THE POLICY.

01:50:09.069 --> 01:50:12.906
THAT WE HAD IN -- BASICALLY IN

01:50:12.973 --> 01:50:13.673
TWO THOUSAND EIGHT WE HAD ABOUT

01:50:13.740 --> 01:50:15.775
A 10% NON RESIDENT GROWTH AND I

01:50:15.842 --> 01:50:17.344
FLATLY REJECT THE NOTION THAT

01:50:17.410 --> 01:50:18.411
WE'RE DOING THIS FOR MORE.

01:50:18.478 --> 01:50:20.580
DIVERSITY BECAUSE FOR A HUNDRED

01:50:20.647 --> 01:50:21.848
FIFTY YEARS YOU SEE WAS TOTALLY

01:50:21.915 --> 01:50:23.650
GREAT WITH EXISTING GREAT

01:50:23.717 --> 01:50:24.784
DIVERSITY FROM.

01:50:24.851 --> 01:50:27.153
FRANKLY THE CALIFORNIA DIVERSITY --

01:50:27.220 --> 01:50:29.656
SO THIS IS ALL ABOUT SIMPLE MY

01:50:29.723 --> 01:50:32.492
SIMPLE NOT ECONOMICS IN OUT YOU

01:50:32.559 --> 01:50:34.027
HAD TO DO THIS TO KEEP.

01:50:34.094 --> 01:50:35.562
THE LIGHTS ON DURING THE GREAT

01:50:35.628 --> 01:50:37.263
RECESSION AND WE GET THAT AND SO

01:50:37.330 --> 01:50:39.366
I THINK ONE OF THE THE GREATEST

01:50:39.432 --> 01:50:40.467
PUSH BACKS THAT THE WILL THE

01:50:40.533 --> 01:50:44.337
WITH THE WILL PUT OUT IS THAT.

01:50:44.404 --> 01:50:45.872
EVEN AFTER WE STARTED GIVING.

01:50:45.939 --> 01:50:47.307
EIGHT SUMS OF MONEY THE LAST

01:50:47.374 --> 01:50:47.941
FIVE YEARS -- MAYBE AS MUCH AS

01:50:48.008 --> 01:50:49.009
YOU SEE WAS ASKING FOR YOUR

01:50:49.075 --> 01:50:50.777
BUDGET REQUEST BUT WELL WELL

01:50:50.844 --> 01:50:51.745
OVER A BILLION DOLLARS.

01:50:51.811 --> 01:50:53.446
THESE NON RESIDENT NUMBERS KEPT

01:50:53.513 --> 01:50:56.116
GOING UP AND UP AND UP AND I

01:50:56.182 --> 01:50:57.350
THINK AT SOME POINT THE POLICY.

01:50:57.417 --> 01:50:59.352
WAS -- WAS ENOUGH AND AND THAT'S

01:50:59.419 --> 01:51:01.287
KINDA -- THE FOCUS ON BUT BUT

01:51:01.354 --> 01:51:02.856
THE ISSUE HERE THOUGH IS THAT

01:51:02.922 --> 01:51:05.959
YOU KNOW EVEN IF WE DID GO BACK --

01:51:06.026 --> 01:51:07.727
AND SOMEHOW MANAGED TO TO

01:51:07.794 --> 01:51:09.129
LEVERAGE AT THE HIGH LEVERAGE

01:51:09.195 --> 01:51:11.631
SITUATION IN THE NEXT LET'S SAY

01:51:11.698 --> 01:51:13.700
FOUR YEARS TO GET UP TO TWO

01:51:13.767 --> 01:51:15.468
HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION A YEAR.

01:51:15.535 --> 01:51:17.337
IF WE DID THAT THAT'S THAT'S AT

01:51:17.404 --> 01:51:18.438
THE EXPENSE OF SOMETHING ELSE

01:51:18.505 --> 01:51:19.906
RIGHT THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY

01:51:19.973 --> 01:51:21.775
BECAUSE WE WOULDN'T HAVE THAT.

01:51:21.841 --> 01:51:23.143
TO TO FOCUS ON OUR DEBT FREE

01:51:23.209 --> 01:51:25.245
COLLEGE PLAN TO DRESS FINANCIAL

01:51:25.311 --> 01:51:26.746
AID TO POTENTIALLY MAKE SURE WE

01:51:26.813 --> 01:51:28.848
ADDRESS THE USE THE UC ISSUE SO

01:51:28.915 --> 01:51:30.784
THERE IS A RISK INVOLVED HERE WE

01:51:30.850 --> 01:51:32.052
WE WE OUGHT WE UNDERSTAND THAT

01:51:32.118 --> 01:51:33.620
AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE

01:51:33.686 --> 01:51:33.820
NEED.

01:51:33.887 --> 01:51:39.592
TO CERTAINLY -- EVALUATE --

01:51:39.659 --> 01:51:40.827
WELCOME BACK IN A SEC BUT FOR

01:51:40.894 --> 01:51:42.195
NOW MISTER MURATSUCHI THANK YOU

01:51:42.262 --> 01:51:45.498
VERY MUCH -- MISTER OCT OFFICER

01:51:45.565 --> 01:51:47.333
YES.

01:51:47.400 --> 01:51:50.437
SO -- BOTTOM LINE IT IN THIS

01:51:50.503 --> 01:51:52.172
REPORT YOU'RE YOU'RE SAYING THAT --

01:51:52.238 --> 01:51:54.607
IN ORDER -- FOR THE STATE OF

01:51:54.674 --> 01:51:56.409
CALIFORNIA TO ENGAGE IN A TEN

01:51:56.476 --> 01:51:58.178
YEAR PLAN.

01:51:58.244 --> 01:52:00.680
TO GET US BACK -- TO NO MORE

01:52:00.747 --> 01:52:02.015
THAN 10%.

01:52:02.082 --> 01:52:03.750
SYSTEM WIDE OF A NON RESIDENTS

01:52:03.817 --> 01:52:05.185
THEY WOULD COST FOUR POINT TWO

01:52:05.251 --> 01:52:06.252
BILLION DOLLARS.

01:52:06.319 --> 01:52:10.023
THAT'S CORRECT -- NAY BUT THAT.

01:52:10.090 --> 01:52:12.092
BUILT INTO THAT NUMBER ARE YOUR

01:52:12.158 --> 01:52:14.327
ASSUMPTIONS THAT YOU STARTED OUT

01:52:14.394 --> 01:52:18.731
WITH -- THAT -- NG INCLUDING THE

01:52:18.798 --> 01:52:21.201
THE ADDITIONAL COSTS OF YOU SEE

01:52:21.267 --> 01:52:22.969
FINANCIAL AID AND INCREASED

01:52:23.036 --> 01:52:24.904
COSTS OF CAL GRANTS AS WELL AS A

01:52:24.971 --> 01:52:27.474
LOSS OF NON RESIDENT TUITION.

01:52:27.540 --> 01:52:29.175

INTO.

01:53:00.406 --> 01:53:01.608
POTENTIAL ALTERNATES INTO THESE

01:53:01.674 --> 01:53:04.043
NUMBERS BUT I'M I'M LOOKING AT

01:53:04.110 --> 01:53:06.946

KIND OF JUMPS OUT TO ME THAT --

01:53:12.886 --> 01:53:16.422
THAT IN AS RECENTLY AS JUST TEN

01:53:16.489 --> 01:53:19.058
YEARS AGO 200-082-0009 ACADEMIC

01:53:19.125 --> 01:53:20.160
YEAR.

01:53:20.226 --> 01:53:21.628
SYSTEM WIDE THE NON RESIDENT

01:53:21.694 --> 01:53:24.697
STUDENTS WERE ONLY ABOUT 5%.

01:53:24.764 --> 01:53:27.800
OF OUR OF OUR STUDENTS.

01:53:27.867 --> 01:53:29.769
AND AND AND TODAY -- WORK OR

01:53:29.836 --> 01:53:31.538
ABOUT 18%.

01:53:31.604 --> 01:53:33.840
AND SO I I JUST HAVE A HARD TIME.

01:53:33.907 --> 01:53:35.308
YOU KNOW.

01:53:35.375 --> 01:53:38.478
UNDERSTANDING WHY WE WOULD.

01:53:38.545 --> 01:53:40.547
YOU KNOW IT NOT IN THE NOT EVEN

01:53:40.613 --> 01:53:41.948
TO GET BACK TO WHERE WE WERE TEN

01:53:42.015 --> 01:53:45.385
YEARS AGO BUT BUT TO GET. 210%.

01:53:45.451 --> 01:53:46.886
OF NON RESIDENT STUDENTS THAT IT

01:53:46.953 --> 01:53:48.888
WOULD COST A FOUR POINT TWO IT

01:53:48.955 --> 01:53:50.490
WILL BE A FOUR POINT TWO BILLION

01:53:50.557 --> 01:53:52.659
DOLLAR OBLIGATION ECLIPSING THE

01:53:52.725 --> 01:53:55.995
ENTIRE -- YOU KNOW STATE GENERAL

01:53:56.062 --> 01:53:57.764
FUND BUDGET FOR THE UNIVERSITY

01:53:57.830 --> 01:54:00.733
CALIFORNIA SYSTEM ME JUST

01:54:00.800 --> 01:54:04.370
DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO ME.

01:54:04.437 --> 01:54:07.006
SO REMEMBER SOMETHING ARE MEANT

01:54:07.073 --> 01:54:08.875
CITY THE AMONG THE FOUR POINT

01:54:08.942 --> 01:54:09.442
TWO MILLION FIGURE IS NOT.

01:54:09.509 --> 01:54:10.109
THE ANNUAL INCREASE IN THAT LAST

01:54:10.176 --> 01:54:11.010
YEAR IT'S THE IT'S THE SOME OF

01:54:11.077 --> 01:54:12.178
THE ANNUAL INCOME SAYS ALONG THE

01:54:12.245 --> 01:54:14.480
WAY THANK YOU -- SECONDLY YOU

01:54:14.547 --> 01:54:15.682
KNOW WE THIS ACTUALLY -- HARKENS

01:54:15.748 --> 01:54:16.449
BACK TO A COMMENT YOU MADE

01:54:16.516 --> 01:54:19.619
EARLIER. ONE WAY TO THINK ABOUT --

01:54:19.686 --> 01:54:21.387
WHY EVERYONE IN THE CLOCK IN

01:54:21.454 --> 01:54:22.922
SUCH A SENS IS SO EXPENSIVE IS

01:54:22.989 --> 01:54:24.524
BECAUSE AS WE DISCUSSED EARLIER

01:54:24.591 --> 01:54:26.125
PART OF THAT GROWTH AND NON

01:54:26.192 --> 01:54:26.859
RESIDENT ROMAN I THINK A LARGE

01:54:26.926 --> 01:54:28.161
PART OF IT WAS?

01:54:28.228 --> 01:54:29.929
AS CHAIR MCCARTY MENTIONED IN

01:54:29.996 --> 01:54:31.698
RESPONSE TO FUNDING SHORTFALLS

01:54:31.764 --> 01:54:35.168
AT THE CAMPUSES.

01:54:35.235 --> 01:54:36.302
AND SO ON DOING THAT.

01:54:36.369 --> 01:54:37.203
INCLUDES NOT JUST FUNDING THE

01:54:37.270 --> 01:54:38.771
COST OF EDUCATING A CALIFORNIA

01:54:38.838 --> 01:54:39.772
RESIDENT IN LIEU OF THAT NON

01:54:39.839 --> 01:54:41.407
RESIDENT BUT IN ESSENCE.

01:54:41.474 --> 01:54:43.009
UNDOING THE SUBSIDY FROM NON

01:54:43.076 --> 01:54:44.711
RESIDENTS THAT THEY HAVE BEEN

01:54:44.777 --> 01:54:46.446
PROVIDING SINCE THEN RIGHT SO

01:54:46.512 --> 01:54:48.348
IT'S IT'S IT'S IT'S ESSENTIALLY

01:54:48.414 --> 01:54:49.115
DOING WHAT YOU WERE TALKING

01:54:49.182 --> 01:54:51.618
ABOUT EARLIER -- BUYING RULING A

01:54:51.684 --> 01:54:53.253
DIFFERENT MIX OF STUDENTS -- AND

01:54:53.319 --> 01:54:54.220
IT IS PRICEY BECAUSE WE'RE

01:54:54.287 --> 01:54:56.522
ESSENTIALLY -- REDUCING THE

01:54:56.589 --> 01:54:58.424
SUBSIDY THAT THE UNIVERSITY IS

01:54:58.491 --> 01:54:59.092
ALREADY GETTING FROM NON

01:54:59.158 --> 01:55:00.460
RESIDENTS AND ESSENTIALLY

01:55:00.526 --> 01:55:02.662
REPLACING THAT WITH STATE

01:55:02.729 --> 01:55:04.330
TAXPAYER SUBSIDY.

01:55:04.397 --> 01:55:06.299
YEAH THERE IS SO AND SO I I I

01:55:06.366 --> 01:55:07.734
GET THE BASIC PICTURE THAT --

01:55:07.800 --> 01:55:10.303
THAT IN ORDER FOR US TO REDUCE

01:55:10.370 --> 01:55:12.272
OR INCREASE THE PROCESS THE THE

01:55:12.338 --> 01:55:15.074
PROPORTION OF CALIFORNIA KIDS

01:55:15.141 --> 01:55:16.075
ATTENDING A UNIVERSITY

01:55:16.142 --> 01:55:17.477
CALIFORNIA SYSTEM THAT IT WOULD.

01:55:17.543 --> 01:55:20.713
TAKE GREATER -- STATE GENERAL

01:55:20.780 --> 01:55:24.550
FUND INVESTMENTS -- YEAH I I'M

01:55:24.617 --> 01:55:28.888
I'M JUST.

01:55:28.955 --> 01:55:30.757
TO A LITTLE HEALTHY SKEPTICISM

01:55:30.823 --> 01:55:32.125
ABOUT THIS FOUR POINT TWO

01:55:32.191 --> 01:55:34.127
BILLION DOLLAR -- PRICE TAG TO

01:55:34.193 --> 01:55:36.062
TO COMP CYCLE -- THANK YOU FOR

01:55:36.129 --> 01:55:38.498
YOUR PRESENTATION.

01:55:38.564 --> 01:55:39.232
YEAH I JUST THINK THAT

01:55:39.299 --> 01:55:42.068
ILLUMINATES HOW MUCH WE WE

01:55:42.135 --> 01:55:44.604
CHARGE FOR NON RESIDENT ROMAN

01:55:44.671 --> 01:55:46.906
AND I SUPPORT THAT MEASURE FOR

01:55:46.973 --> 01:55:48.308
THE REGION'S THIS WEEK I THINK

01:55:48.374 --> 01:55:49.509
IT'S THAT THE SOUND ONE I THINK

01:55:49.575 --> 01:55:52.445
THERE'S YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY.

01:55:52.512 --> 01:55:56.949
MORE -- YOU KNOW -- MORE ANGST

01:55:57.016 --> 01:55:58.251
FROM YOUR STUDENT POPULATION

01:55:58.318 --> 01:55:59.752
ABOUT THIS BUT THAT'S PROBABLY

01:55:59.819 --> 01:56:01.721
BECAUSE YOU KNOW TEN YEARS AGO

01:56:01.788 --> 01:56:03.589
YOU SAID IT WAS ONLY 5% NON

01:56:03.656 --> 01:56:05.725
RESIDENTS NOW IS 20% OF MORE THE

01:56:05.792 --> 01:56:06.993
STUDENTS ARE PART OF YOUR

01:56:07.060 --> 01:56:08.861
CONSTITUENCY.

01:56:08.928 --> 01:56:10.430
AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA.

01:56:10.496 --> 01:56:12.365
BUT THE FLIP SIDE OF THAT IS

01:56:12.432 --> 01:56:13.800
THAT EVEN AS WE'VE INCREASE

01:56:13.866 --> 01:56:16.502
ENROLLMENT -- I'M SORRY EVEN AS

01:56:16.569 --> 01:56:18.604
WE MAKE CREASE THE NON RESIDENT --

01:56:18.671 --> 01:56:20.707
TUITION A NUMBER OF THE NUMBER

01:56:20.773 --> 01:56:23.276
OF APPLICATIONS FROM THE UC.

01:56:23.343 --> 01:56:25.178
INTERNATIONALLY AND ACROSS THE

01:56:25.244 --> 01:56:27.280
THAT THE THAT THE US CON

01:56:27.347 --> 01:56:30.350
CONTINENTAL UNITED STATES -- HAS

01:56:30.416 --> 01:56:31.851
INCREASED CORRECT.

01:56:31.918 --> 01:56:33.186
THAT IS CORRECT YEAH WHAT WHAT

01:56:33.252 --> 01:56:34.787
ARE THE NUMBERS ON ON THAT AS

01:56:34.854 --> 01:56:37.724
FAR AS THE THAT THE STUDY --

01:56:37.790 --> 01:56:40.693
CLIP OF NON RESIDENT SUPPLYING.

01:56:40.760 --> 01:56:41.928
OUT WELL WHEN WE LOOK AT THE

01:56:41.994 --> 01:56:43.863
TRENDS BOTH IN APPLICATIONS AS

01:56:43.930 --> 01:56:45.398
WELL AS IN YIELD RATES.

01:56:45.465 --> 01:56:46.933
WE DON'T SEE MUCH CHANGE OVER

01:56:46.999 --> 01:56:48.368
THE COURSE OF THE PAST SEVERAL

01:56:48.434 --> 01:56:52.672
YEARS EVEN WHEN WE DID HAVE --

01:56:52.739 --> 01:56:54.574
INCREASES IN ON RESIDENTS OF MEL

01:56:54.640 --> 01:56:56.709
TUITION -- RE ANECDOTALLY WE WE

01:56:56.776 --> 01:56:57.877
KNOW THAT CAMPUSES ARE CONCERNED

01:56:57.944 --> 01:56:59.779
AS TO AT WHAT RATE COULD WE

01:56:59.846 --> 01:57:01.013
CONTINUE TO INCREASE -- NON

01:57:01.080 --> 01:57:02.548
RESIDENT TUITION WITHOUT SAYING

01:57:02.615 --> 01:57:04.150
A DROP OFF IN APPLICANTS.

01:57:04.217 --> 01:57:06.052
AND AS YOU KNOW IN ORDER TO BE

01:57:06.119 --> 01:57:07.186
ADMITTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF

01:57:07.253 --> 01:57:08.888
CAP FROM THE CAMPUS OF THOSE NON

01:57:08.955 --> 01:57:10.089
RESIDENTS NEED TO COMPARE

01:57:10.156 --> 01:57:11.591
FAVORABLY TO THE CALIFORNIA

01:57:11.657 --> 01:57:14.560
RESIDENTS WERE AT THAT CAN SO

01:57:14.627 --> 01:57:16.129
IT'S A IT'S A HIGH BAR -- WE DO

01:57:16.195 --> 01:57:18.197
THINK THAT THE PLAN THAT'S BEING

01:57:18.264 --> 01:57:18.731
PRESENTED TO THE REGENTS A

01:57:18.798 --> 01:57:19.499
TOMORROW.

01:57:19.565 --> 01:57:20.867
AT WHICH IS TO ESSENTIALLY KEEP

01:57:20.933 --> 01:57:22.368
THAT INCREASE PEGGED GENERALLY

01:57:22.435 --> 01:57:23.469
TO THE RATE OF INFLATION WHICH

01:57:23.536 --> 01:57:25.004
BASICALLY HOLES AT FLAT AND

01:57:25.071 --> 01:57:26.506
CONSTANT DOLLARS -- BOTH

01:57:26.572 --> 01:57:27.840
PROVIDES MUCH NEEDED REVENUE

01:57:27.907 --> 01:57:31.444
WITHOUT PROVIDING A MATERIAL A

01:57:31.511 --> 01:57:32.578
BARRIER TO ENROLLMENT OR TO

01:57:32.645 --> 01:57:34.013
SUCCESS FOR THOSE NON RESIDENT

01:57:34.080 --> 01:57:35.415
STUDENTS WE ALREADY HAVE.

01:57:35.481 --> 01:57:37.016
AND THAT KIND OF AN INFLATION

01:57:37.083 --> 01:57:39.252
BASED ADJUSTMENT IS BUILT INTO

01:57:39.318 --> 01:57:41.053
THE LONG TERM FUNDING PLAN THAT

01:57:41.120 --> 01:57:44.690
WE SHARED WITH THE REGION'S IN

01:57:44.757 --> 01:57:46.125
MARCH.

01:57:46.192 --> 01:57:48.394
WE WE HAVE -- INCREASED IT BY A

01:57:48.461 --> 01:57:48.961
GREATER RATES IN THE PAST.

01:57:49.028 --> 01:57:50.096
WHEN WE LOOKED TO SEE AND THIS

01:57:50.163 --> 01:57:51.397
IS MENTIONED IN THE REPORT --

01:57:51.464 --> 01:57:53.065
WHAT KIND OF INCREASES WOULD BE

01:57:53.132 --> 01:57:55.468
NECESSARY -- AMONGST OUR SMALLER

01:57:55.535 --> 01:57:57.170
POPULATION OF NON RESIDENTS IF

01:57:57.236 --> 01:57:58.504
WE WERE TO REDUCE IT.

01:57:58.571 --> 01:58:00.106
IN ORDER TO COMPENSATE FOR THE

01:58:00.173 --> 01:58:01.741
LOST NONRESIDENT REVENUE IT

01:58:01.808 --> 01:58:03.609
WOULD REQUIRE YEAR OVER YEAR

01:58:03.676 --> 01:58:05.545
INCREASES OF ABOUT 7% -- FOR

01:58:05.611 --> 01:58:07.847
THIS THE TEN YEAR PERIOD.

01:58:07.914 --> 01:58:09.449
IT WOULD MAKE THE TUITION

01:58:09.515 --> 01:58:11.117
INCLUDING NOT JUST NON RESIDENT

01:58:11.184 --> 01:58:12.518
TUITION BUT BASS TUITION A

01:58:12.585 --> 01:58:14.120
BECAUSE THE SEVENTY FIVE

01:58:14.187 --> 01:58:15.822
THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR FOR NON

01:58:15.888 --> 01:58:16.823
RESIDENTS.

01:58:16.889 --> 01:58:18.024
RIDLEY ALREADY WHEN YOU LOOK AT

01:58:18.090 --> 01:58:18.658
OUR TUITION AS WELL OF COST OF

01:58:18.724 --> 01:58:20.960
LIVING -- MANY OF OUR CAMPUSES

01:58:21.027 --> 01:58:22.562
ARE AMONG THE MOST EXPENSIVE FOR

01:58:22.628 --> 01:58:24.564
NON RESIDENTS IN THE COUNTRY A

01:58:24.630 --> 01:58:26.566
MERCED RIVERSIDE SEVERAL OTHERS

01:58:26.632 --> 01:58:27.633
ARE MORE EXPENSIVE THAN THE

01:58:27.700 --> 01:58:29.035
UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN.

01:58:29.101 --> 01:58:30.603
THEN THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA --

01:58:30.670 --> 01:58:33.206
SO WE ARE MINDFUL OF AT WHAT

01:58:33.272 --> 01:58:36.909
POINT DO WE TIP THE SCALES AND

01:58:36.976 --> 01:58:37.944
AND SEE THAT.

01:58:38.010 --> 01:58:39.812
WE IN FACT ARE DRIVING STUDENTS

01:58:39.879 --> 01:58:41.547
AWAY AND WE CAN'T ACTUALLY SO

01:58:41.614 --> 01:58:42.415
THE THE 10%.

01:58:42.482 --> 01:58:45.818
PROPOSAL FOR TOMORROW. 10% NON

01:58:45.885 --> 01:58:47.353
RESIDENT TUITION INCREASE EVERY

01:58:47.420 --> 01:58:48.788
SENSE IT'S A IT'S A NO IT'S A

01:58:48.855 --> 01:58:51.524
IT'S A TWO POINT 6%. TO POINTS

01:58:51.591 --> 01:58:53.259
RIGHT IT'S AN INFLATION BASED

01:58:53.326 --> 01:58:53.926
INVESTMENT THAT YOU'RE AN

01:58:53.993 --> 01:58:55.294
EXTRINSIC DALY SAID WHAT WHAT

01:58:55.361 --> 01:58:57.163
WAS IS WHAT YOU SAY 10% THEN.

01:58:57.230 --> 01:59:02.535
I'D I'D A DID I I DON'T OKAY I

01:59:02.602 --> 01:59:03.135
DIDN'T MEAN TO IF I DID I HAVE

01:59:03.202 --> 01:59:03.503
YET [inaudible]

01:59:03.569 --> 01:59:05.872
OKAY AT SO YES IT WOULD I

01:59:05.938 --> 01:59:07.306
SUPPORT THAT WE THE WAY I THINK

01:59:07.373 --> 01:59:08.875
WE SUPPORT THAT -- THE

01:59:08.941 --> 01:59:09.742
CONSCIOUSNESS WE'VE HAD WAS YOU

01:59:09.809 --> 01:59:10.510
KNOW LEADERSHIP HERE AND

01:59:10.576 --> 01:59:13.713
LEGISLATURE ON THIS ISSUE -- IN

01:59:13.779 --> 01:59:15.581
THE SUMMER SAID OF COURSE.

01:59:15.648 --> 01:59:17.283
CAN SPEAK FOR THE SENATE. ONE

01:59:17.350 --> 01:59:18.951
THING THAT THAT I WOULD YOU WANT

01:59:19.018 --> 01:59:21.654
TO RAISE THE NOTION OF THE

01:59:21.721 --> 01:59:23.122
FINANCIAL AID.

01:59:23.189 --> 01:59:23.556
AND THE YOU KNOW.

01:59:23.623 --> 01:59:24.156
A FEW YEARS AGO WE HAD THIS

01:59:24.223 --> 01:59:26.125
CONVERSATION AS FAR AS THE THE

01:59:26.192 --> 01:59:27.493
UC.

01:59:27.560 --> 01:59:28.594
THE RETURN THE RETURN EIGHT ON

01:59:28.661 --> 01:59:30.563
TUITION A THIRD OF THE TUITION

01:59:30.630 --> 01:59:33.266
GOES BACK FOR FOR FINANCIAL AID.

01:59:33.332 --> 01:59:34.834
AND YOU'RE USING SOME OF THAT

01:59:34.901 --> 01:59:36.936
FOR TO GET FINANCIAL AID FOR NON

01:59:37.003 --> 01:59:38.538
RESIDENT STUDENTS AND YOU KNOW

01:59:38.604 --> 01:59:40.339
WE THOUGHT THAT WAS.

01:59:40.406 --> 01:59:43.309
INAPPROPRIATE SO DID -- THAT THE

01:59:43.376 --> 01:59:45.211
CONCLUSION WITH WITH THAT YOU

01:59:45.278 --> 01:59:46.546
YOU SEE LEADERSHIP AND YOU'RE

01:59:46.612 --> 01:59:49.282
LOOKING TO TO GO BACK AND AND

01:59:49.348 --> 01:59:51.050
UNRAVEL THAT ARRANGEMENT SO CAN

01:59:51.117 --> 01:59:52.752
YOU TALK ABOUT THAT -- YES I

01:59:52.818 --> 01:59:53.686
WOULDN'T CHARACTERIZE IT THAT

01:59:53.753 --> 01:59:55.121
WAY BUT IT WOULD BE HEARD LOUD

01:59:55.187 --> 01:59:56.522
AND CLEAR FROM THE LEGISLATURE

01:59:56.589 --> 01:59:57.857
WAS THAT -- TUITION THE BASE FEE

01:59:57.924 --> 01:59:59.158
PAID BY ALL STUDENTS INCLUDING

01:59:59.225 --> 02:00:00.893
NON RESIDENTS A PORTION OF THAT

02:00:00.960 --> 02:00:02.828
WAS BEING USED TO REDUCE --

02:00:02.895 --> 02:00:04.096
FINANCIAL BURDENS ON NON

02:00:04.163 --> 02:00:05.364
RESIDENT STUDENTS AND THAT THERE

02:00:05.431 --> 02:00:08.301
IS A HIGHER BETTER USE FOR THOSE

02:00:08.367 --> 02:00:09.035
DOLLARS WHICH IS TO SUPPORT

02:00:09.101 --> 02:00:09.669
ENROLLMENT GROWTH.

02:00:09.735 --> 02:00:11.404
AND WE MADE THAT -- CHANGE AND

02:00:11.470 --> 02:00:12.538
HAVE BEEN PHASING OUT THE

02:00:12.605 --> 02:00:14.006
STUDENTS ELIGIBILITY FOR THAT --

02:00:14.073 --> 02:00:19.045
EVER SINCE THE ENTERING CLASS OF

02:00:19.111 --> 02:00:19.612
SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN THE ISSUE

02:00:19.679 --> 02:00:20.479
THAT'S ON THE TABLE NOW IS ONLY

02:00:20.546 --> 02:00:21.380
ABOUT THE MARGINAL.

02:00:21.447 --> 02:00:22.648
NONRESIDENT TUITION REVENUE NOT

02:00:22.715 --> 02:00:23.783
THE BASE TUITION AVENUE BUT THE

02:00:23.849 --> 02:00:26.319
MARGINAL WE CALL AND R. S. T..

02:00:26.385 --> 02:00:28.287
THAT WOULD BE DERIVED FROM THE

02:00:28.354 --> 02:00:29.155
PROPOSED INCREASE.

02:00:29.221 --> 02:00:31.958
FROM FROM FROM THIS SMALL TWO

02:00:32.024 --> 02:00:33.459
POINT 6% ACCESS.

02:00:33.526 --> 02:00:36.128
AND 7% OF THIS 2% INTEREST SO

02:00:36.195 --> 02:00:37.763
NOT A DIFFERENT BEFORE BECAUSE

02:00:37.830 --> 02:00:39.498
THAT WAS THE FINANCIAL AID

02:00:39.565 --> 02:00:40.833
OVERALL FOR EVERYBODY YOU'RE

02:00:40.900 --> 02:00:42.368
USING SOME OF THAT TO FOCUS ON

02:00:42.435 --> 02:00:43.603
NON RESIDENT STUDENTS THAT'S

02:00:43.669 --> 02:00:44.837
CORRECT SO ONE WAY TO THINK

02:00:44.904 --> 02:00:46.739
ABOUT THIS IS THAT -- UNIVERSE

02:00:46.806 --> 02:00:48.941
ACTUALLY PROPOSING AT A SEVEN

02:00:49.008 --> 02:00:51.143
HUNDRED SIXTY DOT TWO DOLLAR

02:00:51.210 --> 02:00:51.711
INCREASE FOR A NON RESIDENT

02:00:51.777 --> 02:00:54.647
STUDENTS -- IN TO A SMALL EXTENT.

02:00:54.714 --> 02:00:55.715
SOME OF THOSE NON RESIDENT

02:00:55.781 --> 02:00:57.416
STUDENTS WILL BE CONTRIBUTING A

02:00:57.483 --> 02:00:58.784
LITTLE BIT OF THAT A TO HELP

02:00:58.851 --> 02:01:00.486
OFFSET THE COSTS FOR OTHER NON

02:01:00.553 --> 02:01:02.021
RESIDENTS DID YEAH AND WHAT ARE

02:01:02.088 --> 02:01:03.222
THE WHAT'S THE RATIONALE FOR

02:01:03.289 --> 02:01:04.657
THAT WHAT.

02:01:04.724 --> 02:01:05.424
WELL OUR CONCERN WAS EXPRESSED

02:01:05.491 --> 02:01:06.258
YOU MIGHT GIVE ME COULD PAINT A

02:01:06.325 --> 02:01:07.660
PICTURE OF THE STUDENTS AND IT'S

02:01:07.727 --> 02:01:08.527
I KNOW THAT.

02:01:08.594 --> 02:01:09.962
I WANT TO GET TO THIS THE SECOND

02:01:10.029 --> 02:01:10.796
THERE ARE SOME HYPOTHETICALS

02:01:10.863 --> 02:01:14.600
ABOUT SOME -- SEVEN UNDOCUMENTED

02:01:14.667 --> 02:01:16.869
STUDENTS WHO WERE PAYING NON

02:01:16.936 --> 02:01:18.537
RESIDENT TUITION AND I'M NOT

02:01:18.604 --> 02:01:21.107
SURE IF THAT WAS JUST A BLABBER

02:01:21.173 --> 02:01:22.441
THAT WAS A GREAT NUMBER.

02:01:22.508 --> 02:01:23.709
CONCERNED ABOUT THAT WAS REYES

02:01:23.776 --> 02:01:25.745
WE THINK THOSE ARE ACTUALLY VERY

02:01:25.811 --> 02:01:26.679
FEW STUDENTS BECAUSE YOU'RE

02:01:26.746 --> 02:01:28.080
UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS AND YOU

02:01:28.147 --> 02:01:30.116
DON'T QUALIFY FOR AN INTEREST

02:01:30.182 --> 02:01:32.451
EXEMPTION FOR UNDER EIGHTY FIVE

02:01:32.518 --> 02:01:33.152
FORTY IT WOULD BE EXTREMELY

02:01:33.219 --> 02:01:35.087
CHALLENGING TO FINANCE.

02:01:35.154 --> 02:01:36.122
YOUR EDUCATION EITHER ACTS OUT

02:01:36.188 --> 02:01:37.556
SO TO THE EXTENT THAT WE DO HAVE

02:01:37.623 --> 02:01:38.624
THE STATUS OF THAT WAS

02:01:38.691 --> 02:01:39.625
INACCURATE AND THAT'S THAT'S

02:01:39.692 --> 02:01:40.726
THAT WE IT PROBABLY THOUGHT THAT

02:01:40.793 --> 02:01:41.961
IT WOULD BE VERY UNLIKELY THAT

02:01:42.028 --> 02:01:43.863
YOU WOULD SEE THAT TO HAPPEN YES

02:01:43.929 --> 02:01:45.197
I THINK THERE WAS. ONE

02:01:45.264 --> 02:01:47.800
UNDERSTANDING AS TO THE MAGNET

02:01:47.867 --> 02:01:49.502
BUT WAS THERE A EXAMPLE OF IN

02:01:49.568 --> 02:01:50.703
THAT SCENARIO I DON'T MEAN TO

02:01:50.770 --> 02:01:52.304
SUGGEST THAT THE I DON'T WANNA

02:01:52.371 --> 02:01:53.539
SAY THAT THERE'S NOBODY AT THE

02:01:53.606 --> 02:01:55.341
UNIVERSITY BUT YOU KNOW I THINK

02:01:55.408 --> 02:01:57.576
THAT THE NUMBER IS LIKELY TO BE --

02:01:57.643 --> 02:02:01.347
WITHIN THE LOW DOUBLE DIGITS BUT

02:02:01.414 --> 02:02:03.282
SAY OKAY -- TO NOW THE OTHER

02:02:03.349 --> 02:02:03.883
ISSUE THAT WAS RAISED THAT WAS

02:02:03.949 --> 02:02:05.251
THAT THERE ARE A NON RESIDENT

02:02:05.317 --> 02:02:07.119
STUDENTS WHO -- WHETHER THEY'RE

02:02:07.186 --> 02:02:09.655
FROM OTHER STATES OR FROM OTHER

02:02:09.722 --> 02:02:11.691
COUNTRIES THAT MAY FOR WHATEVER

02:02:11.757 --> 02:02:12.658
REASON FIND THEMSELVES IN

02:02:12.725 --> 02:02:14.427
FINANCIAL DISTRESS -- IN THE

02:02:14.493 --> 02:02:22.501
CASE OF AN INTERNATIONAL STUDENT

02:02:22.568 --> 02:02:24.437
MIGHT BE THE EXAMPLE RAISED IF

02:02:24.503 --> 02:02:25.671
THERE'S A ECONOMIC TURMOIL AT

02:02:25.738 --> 02:02:26.972
THEIR HOME COUNTRY -- ARE

02:02:27.039 --> 02:02:28.207
UNKNOWN RESIDENTS TO FOR

02:02:28.274 --> 02:02:29.442
WHATEVER REASON THERE'S THERE

02:02:29.508 --> 02:02:30.042
THERE THERE REALLY STRETCHING

02:02:30.109 --> 02:02:31.243
THEMSELVES TO BE ABLE TO ATTEND

02:02:31.310 --> 02:02:31.844
YOU SEE ALREADY.

02:02:31.911 --> 02:02:32.678
I'M WE WE DON'T THINK THERE'S A

02:02:32.745 --> 02:02:33.646
THAT THAT NUMBER IS A

02:02:33.713 --> 02:02:34.246
PARTICULARLY LARGE AND WE SAY

02:02:34.313 --> 02:02:34.880
THAT BECAUSE WHEN WE LOOK AT THE

02:02:34.947 --> 02:02:35.748
NUMBER OF NON RESIDENT TO TAKE

02:02:35.815 --> 02:02:36.382
OUT A STUDENT LOAN.

02:02:36.449 --> 02:02:38.017
YEAH IT'S ABOUT 10%.

02:02:38.084 --> 02:02:39.585
AND SO THAT'S ONE GOOD

02:02:39.652 --> 02:02:41.587
INDICATION THAT IT IS OUT OF

02:02:41.654 --> 02:02:42.755
LESS NEEDY POPULATION THAN THAT

02:02:42.822 --> 02:02:44.390
THE POPULATION AT LARGE BUT

02:02:44.457 --> 02:02:45.024
NEVER WAS THERE IS INTERESTING

02:02:45.091 --> 02:02:46.425
IT OPEN IN HAVING AT LEAST A

02:02:46.492 --> 02:02:47.493
PORTION OF THIS REVENUE

02:02:47.560 --> 02:02:50.663
AVAILABLE TO HELP THE STUDENTS

02:02:50.730 --> 02:02:52.398
AND TIRED.

02:02:52.465 --> 02:02:53.599
AND THEN -- LASTLY THAT THE THE

02:02:53.666 --> 02:02:55.367
REVENUE THAT WHICH BE GENERATED

02:02:55.434 --> 02:02:58.237
BY THIS INCREASE -- WHERE WOULD

02:02:58.304 --> 02:02:59.638
I GO WHAT IT GOT HELP IN ROME

02:02:59.705 --> 02:03:01.474
MORE CALIFORNIA STUDENTS?

02:03:01.540 --> 02:03:02.641
NO IT IS ALREADY IN THE SENSE

02:03:02.708 --> 02:03:03.776
ACCOUNTED FOR IN OTHER PARTS OF

02:03:03.843 --> 02:03:07.313
OUR BUDGET REQUEST AS AS MR

02:03:07.379 --> 02:03:08.481
SALTED MENTIONED.

02:03:08.547 --> 02:03:10.216
IN OUR BUDGET PLAN WE DO HAVE

02:03:10.282 --> 02:03:12.118
OTHER REVENUE SOURCES INCLUDING

02:03:12.184 --> 02:03:14.120
AND RST -- BUT THAT'S IN

02:03:14.186 --> 02:03:14.987
ADDITION TO THE FUNDING WE'RE

02:03:15.054 --> 02:03:16.122
SEEKING FOR ENROLLMENT GROWTH

02:03:16.188 --> 02:03:17.656
BECAUSE THERE ARE OTHER.

02:03:17.723 --> 02:03:18.924
EXPENDITURE INCREASES ON THE

02:03:18.991 --> 02:03:20.693
LEFT SIDE OF THE OF THE LEDGER

02:03:20.760 --> 02:03:22.528
YEAH WELL THE REASON I ASK THAT

02:03:22.595 --> 02:03:24.830
IS BECAUSE IT HAD YOUR ANSWER IS

02:03:24.897 --> 02:03:26.165
YOUR ANSWER BUT IT'S SOMEWHAT

02:03:26.232 --> 02:03:28.033
UNSATISFACTORY TO THE PEOPLE OF

02:03:28.100 --> 02:03:29.869
CALIFORNIA BECAUSE THE ARGUMENT

02:03:29.935 --> 02:03:31.036
THAT YOU'VE MADE.

02:03:31.103 --> 02:03:32.705
OVER THE YEARS AS BY ENROLLING

02:03:32.772 --> 02:03:35.040
MORE NON RESIDENTS WE'RE GOING

02:03:35.107 --> 02:03:36.008
TO HELP AND MORE.

02:03:36.075 --> 02:03:37.676
CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS SEE WOULD

02:03:37.743 --> 02:03:38.577
THINK THAT.

02:03:38.644 --> 02:03:41.213
ADDITIONAL REVENUE WOULD GO NOT

02:03:41.280 --> 02:03:42.882
TO MAKE IT EQUAL OUT FOR THAT

02:03:42.948 --> 02:03:44.617
POPULATION BUT HELP.

02:03:44.683 --> 02:03:46.719
CALIFORNIA STUDENTS GROW WE HAVE

02:03:46.786 --> 02:03:47.453
ABSOLUTELY SAID THAT IS HELP

02:03:47.520 --> 02:03:48.654
SUPPORT IN ROMAN OF CALIFORNIA

02:03:48.721 --> 02:03:50.089
STUDENTS AND I'LL SHOW YOU ONE

02:03:50.156 --> 02:03:52.291
WAY IN WHICH IT WILL HELP -- IF

02:03:52.358 --> 02:03:53.125
HE WOULD LOOK FOR EXAMPLE AND

02:03:53.192 --> 02:03:54.126
THIS IS KIND OF A A DISTURBING

02:03:54.193 --> 02:03:55.528
TREND BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE

02:03:55.594 --> 02:03:56.428
LAST COUPLE OF YEARS.

02:03:56.495 --> 02:03:57.863
AMONG CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS AT

02:03:57.930 --> 02:03:59.565
NEARLY EVERY UC CAMPUS.

02:03:59.632 --> 02:04:04.336
THE PERSISTENCE RIGHT AFTER ONE

02:04:04.403 --> 02:04:06.405
YEAR HAS DECLINED.

02:04:06.472 --> 02:04:07.006
SO IN OTHER WORDS WE'VE HAD A

02:04:07.072 --> 02:04:08.274
HIGHER PERCENTAGE AND IT'S NOT

02:04:08.340 --> 02:04:09.308
HUGE BUT IT'S WE FEAR THAT IT'S

02:04:09.375 --> 02:04:10.209
SORT OF LIKE THE CAMEL'S NOSE

02:04:10.276 --> 02:04:10.609
UNDER THE TENT.

02:04:10.676 --> 02:04:11.243
OF OF A CHANGING OUTCOMES THAT

02:04:11.310 --> 02:04:12.244
WE FIND DISTRESSING AND THAT WE

02:04:12.311 --> 02:04:13.345
THINK IS AN INDICATOR FOR JUST

02:04:13.412 --> 02:04:14.346
THAT RATE OF NON RESIDENT

02:04:14.413 --> 02:04:17.049
STUDENTS IN OF CALIFORNIA

02:04:17.116 --> 02:04:18.150
RESIDENTS TO CALIFORNIA'S MISTER.

02:04:18.217 --> 02:04:18.684
THAT IS THE PERCENTAGE OF

02:04:18.751 --> 02:04:20.186
STUDENTS WHO.

02:04:20.252 --> 02:04:21.554
REMAIN ENROLLED IN CALIFORNIA

02:04:21.620 --> 02:04:22.555
THERE TO RE ENROLL IN CALIFORNIA

02:04:22.621 --> 02:04:24.089
THE SECOND YEAR AFTER BEING HERE

02:04:24.156 --> 02:04:25.024
THEIR FIRST YEAR.

02:04:25.090 --> 02:04:26.292
YOU SEEN OTHER INDICATORS OF

02:04:26.358 --> 02:04:27.593
DISTRESS AROUND THE STUDENTS ARE

02:04:27.660 --> 02:04:28.961
LESS LIKELY TO GET LETTERS OF

02:04:29.028 --> 02:04:30.963
RECOMMENDATION OR A LESS ABLE TO

02:04:31.030 --> 02:04:32.464
GET INTO THEIR OWN MAJORS THIS

02:04:32.531 --> 02:04:34.099
IS YET ANOTHER ONE THAT WERE NOW

02:04:34.166 --> 02:04:35.301
SAYING AND IT'S AS I SAID IT'S

02:04:35.367 --> 02:04:36.569
FOR TWO CONSECUTIVE YEARS.

02:04:36.635 --> 02:04:38.103
AND WE THINK IT IS A CONCRETE

02:04:38.170 --> 02:04:39.972
INDICATOR THAT -- THAT THOSE

02:04:40.039 --> 02:04:42.575
RESOURCES ARE NEEDED AND SO THIS

02:04:42.641 --> 02:04:44.610
FOR SOLDERING IRONS ALL THAT ALL

02:04:44.677 --> 02:04:45.544
THAT STUFF.

02:04:45.611 --> 02:04:46.412
WHETHER IT'S ACADEMIC ADVISING

02:04:46.478 --> 02:04:47.046

02:11:31.550 --> 02:11:33.986
IN SACRAMENTO STATE UNIVERSITY.

02:11:34.052 --> 02:11:35.554
SO THE PROPOSAL DOES RAISE

02:11:35.621 --> 02:11:37.256
EQUITY QUESTIONS AND EQUITY

02:11:37.322 --> 02:11:39.391
ISSUES FOR FOSTER YOUTH LIVING

02:11:39.458 --> 02:11:40.626

02:11:40.692 --> 02:11:42.394
AS WELL AS FOSTER YOUTH LIVING

02:11:42.461 --> 02:11:44.129
IN THE SACRAMENTO AREA THAT THAT

THE THIRTY THAT WERE CHOSE.

02:11:49.201 --> 02:11:50.002
THEY COULD BE CHOSEN.

02:11:50.068 --> 02:11:51.336
SO WHERE THE LEGISLATURE TO WANT

02:11:51.403 --> 02:11:53.205
TO PROVIDE MORE ACCESS TO FOSTER

02:11:53.272 --> 02:11:54.773
USE THROUGHOUT THE STATE COST

OBVIOUSLY WOULDN'T BE MUCH

02:11:56.008 --> 02:11:57.442
HIGHER THAN WHAT THE GOVERNOR'S

02:11:57.509 --> 02:11:59.244
PROPOSAL SO IT'S JUST THIS COST

02:11:59.311 --> 02:12:00.779

COMPONENTS OF THE REQUEST -- MY

02:13:45.650 --> 02:13:46.718
SECOND SET OF COMMENTS RELATES

02:13:46.785 --> 02:13:47.319
TO THE NEW MAY REVISION ITEMS

02:13:47.386 --> 02:13:48.086
DESCRIBED IN ISSUE SIX IN

02:13:48.153 --> 02:13:49.187
ARTICULATED BY THE DEPARTMENT

02:13:49.254 --> 02:13:50.288
FINANCE IN LA -- THE GOVERNOR'S

02:13:50.355 --> 02:13:57.729
MADE IT CLEAR -- THAT A PRIORITY

02:13:57.796 --> 02:13:59.798
FOR OF HIS IS TO INVEST MORE IN

02:13:59.865 --> 02:14:00.899
HELPING STUDENTS WITH THEIR WITH

02:14:00.966 --> 02:14:01.533
THE LARGEST.

02:14:01.600 --> 02:14:02.701
WITH LARGE CHALLENGES.

02:14:02.768 --> 02:14:04.069
AND WE AGREE THOSE GOALS ARE

02:14:04.136 --> 02:14:04.503
LAUDABLE.

02:14:04.569 --> 02:14:05.604
HOWEVER THERE IS A CHALLENGE

02:14:05.670 --> 02:14:06.671
HERE AND I THINK IT THIS GOES TO

02:14:06.738 --> 02:14:08.273
YOUR POINT EARLIER DURING THE UC

02:14:08.340 --> 02:14:09.541
IN THE C. ISSUE JUST AREN'T

02:14:09.608 --> 02:14:10.575
DURING THE UC ITEM.

02:14:10.642 --> 02:14:11.243
IN IN KEY IN THE IDEA OF KEEPING

02:14:11.309 --> 02:14:12.144
THE EYE ON THE PRIZE OR THE IDEA

02:14:12.210 --> 02:14:13.345
OF OF SPORTING UNIVERSITY.

02:14:13.412 --> 02:14:14.112
AND NOT BEING DISTRACTED BY A

02:14:14.179 --> 02:14:15.514
NUMBER OF OTHER ITEMS THAT.

02:14:15.580 --> 02:14:16.815
THAT COULD BE GOOD AND BE

02:14:16.882 --> 02:14:19.050
BENEFICIAL TO OUR STUDENTS BUT

02:14:19.117 --> 02:14:21.453
REALLY DO NOT FIND THAT THE CORE

02:14:21.520 --> 02:14:22.687
FUNCTIONS OF THE UNIVERSITY.

02:14:22.754 --> 02:14:24.055
AND SO WE BELIEVE THE BEST

02:14:24.122 --> 02:14:26.558
APPROACH IS A FIRST FOR FIRST

02:14:26.625 --> 02:14:27.159
FOR THOSE COMPONENTS OF THE

02:14:27.225 --> 02:14:28.960
TRUSTEES BUDGET REQUEST TO BE

02:14:29.027 --> 02:14:31.196

ISSUED IN ROMAN -- EVEN CAPITAL

02:14:33.098 --> 02:14:35.066
IF THAT'S A POSSIBILITY -- WHEN

02:14:35.133 --> 02:14:49.047
THIS ISACCOMPLISHED MAKES SENSE

02:14:49.114 --> 02:14:50.248
TO PERSON AFTER THAT'S

02:14:50.315 --> 02:14:50.816
ACCOMPLISHED AND MAKE SENSE

02:14:50.882 --> 02:14:53.985
PURSUE THESE OTHER TYPES OF

02:14:54.052 --> 02:14:55.654

PUTTING SOME OF THESE MONIES TO

02:15:01.960 --> 02:15:02.994
CSU YOU'D RATHER.

02:15:03.061 --> 02:15:04.362
A RE DIRECT THAT TO GENERAL CSU

02:15:04.429 --> 02:15:04.996

HERE IS THAT YOU WOULD WANT TO

02:15:05.697 --> 02:15:06.231
FILL THE BUCKET OF THE BUDGET

02:15:06.298 --> 02:15:07.632
REQUEST FIRST FROM THE TRUSTEES

02:15:07.699 --> 02:15:08.300
AND AND AND THAT AND THEN ATTACK

02:15:08.366 --> 02:15:08.900
SOME OF THESE ISSUES THEY ARE

02:15:08.967 --> 02:15:09.534
YOU KNOW AS AS POINT OUT THERE.

02:15:09.601 --> 02:15:10.101
ARE SOME ISSUES ONE OF THE

02:15:10.168 --> 02:15:12.170
ISSUES THAT YOU HAVE TO CONSIDER

02:15:12.237 --> 02:15:12.838
IS.

02:15:12.904 --> 02:15:13.672
IF YOU DO ESTABLISH A CERTAIN

02:15:13.738 --> 02:15:14.539
POPULATION OF STUDENTS RECEIVING

02:15:14.606 --> 02:15:15.674
EMERGENCY HOUSING OBVIOUSLY WE

02:15:15.740 --> 02:15:16.308
HAVE A HUGE AMOUNT A NEED RIGHT

02:15:16.374 --> 02:15:16.975
ON THE UNIVERSITY CAMPUS WE HAD

02:15:17.042 --> 02:15:19.611
A SURVEY DONE BACK IN BETWEEN

02:15:19.678 --> 02:15:21.513
TWO THOUSAND LATE SEVEN TWENTY

02:15:21.580 --> 02:15:22.047
SEVENTEEN AND INTO TWENTY

02:15:22.113 --> 02:15:23.181
EIGHTEEN REPORTING.

02:15:23.248 --> 02:15:24.716
THAT ABOUT 10% OF OUR STUDENT

02:15:24.783 --> 02:15:26.485
POPULATION DEALS WITH A HOUSING

02:15:26.551 --> 02:15:28.253
AND SECURITY WILL EXTRAPOLATE

02:15:28.320 --> 02:15:30.388
THAT ACROSS THE SYSTEM AND

02:15:30.455 --> 02:15:31.056
YOU'RE LOOKING AT FIFTY THOUSAND

02:15:31.122 --> 02:15:32.123
STUDENTS.

02:15:32.190 --> 02:15:33.792
SO ONE OF THE POINTS IN IN IN IN

02:15:33.859 --> 02:15:35.126
CONSIDERING THESE SORTS OF

02:15:35.193 --> 02:15:37.028
INVESTMENTS IS IF YOU DO CREATE

02:15:37.095 --> 02:15:39.064
AN ONGOING COMMITMENT THAT MIGHT

02:15:39.130 --> 02:15:41.233
REPRESENT YOU KNOW ONE TENTH OF

02:15:41.299 --> 02:15:42.334
THAT POPULATION.

02:15:42.400 --> 02:15:43.768
THEN IT CREATES A PRESSURE FREE

02:15:43.835 --> 02:15:44.903
IN THE FUTURE ESPECIALLY IN

02:15:44.970 --> 02:15:45.904
LIGHT OF THE COMMENTS MADE

02:15:45.971 --> 02:15:47.739
EARLIER ABOUT UPCOMING RECESSION.

02:15:47.806 --> 02:15:49.541
OF OF ESTABLISHING MAYBE A GOAL

02:15:49.608 --> 02:15:51.042
OF TRYING TO TO HOUSE EVERY

02:15:51.109 --> 02:15:53.111
SINGLE STUDENT EVERY SENSE EVERY

02:15:53.178 --> 02:15:54.279
SINGLE WAY NOT HAVING TO THE

ABILITY TO FUND THAT AS WELL AS

02:15:55.914 --> 02:15:57.883
MAYBE THE FOOD COURT TENANTS OF

THE UNIVERSITY YEAH.

02:15:59.384 --> 02:16:00.051
JUST SOMETHING TO CONSIDER.

02:16:00.118 --> 02:16:01.419
WELL SURE I THINK THIS IS

02:16:01.486 --> 02:16:03.588
SOMETHING THAT -- IS KIND OF A

02:16:03.655 --> 02:16:06.157
RESPONSE THAT -- WE'RE SEEING

02:16:06.224 --> 02:16:07.826
FROM OUR COMMUNITIES AS FAR AS

02:16:07.893 --> 02:16:09.828
THE BASIC NEEDS THAT IF IT'S

02:16:09.895 --> 02:16:11.263
CRAZY TO THINK THAT.

02:16:11.329 --> 02:16:12.831
THEY HAVE A BEAUTIFUL FOOD

02:16:12.898 --> 02:16:14.866
PANTRY AT SAC STATE YOU KNOW WE

YEARS AGO WALKING INTO SEX STATE

02:16:18.737 --> 02:16:19.271
MAYBE THAT HAVE SOME TYPE OF

02:16:19.337 --> 02:16:20.839
PROGRAM BUT IT LOOKS LIKE

02:16:20.906 --> 02:16:22.340
SOMETHING FROM A YOU KNOW ONE OF

02:16:22.407 --> 02:16:23.942

AT THE REALITIES AND SO.

02:16:42.027 --> 02:16:43.094
I THINK THAT WE CAN'T WE CAN'T

02:16:43.161 --> 02:16:44.763
IGNORE THAT AND AND ONE OF THE

02:16:44.829 --> 02:16:45.397
THINGS TO WHERE I THINK THIS.

RAPID RE HOUSING.

02:16:46.464 --> 02:16:47.899

EDUCATE STUDENTS.

02:23:03.374 --> 02:23:04.208
AND ONE THING THAT WE HAVE

02:23:04.275 --> 02:23:06.077
NOTICED -- IN MANY YEARS AND

02:23:06.144 --> 02:23:07.679
HAVE DONE THROUGH THE GRAD

02:23:07.745 --> 02:23:10.081
INITIATIVE LAUNCH IS TO REALLY.

02:23:10.148 --> 02:23:12.850
STATE CENTRALLY FOCUSED ON THE

02:23:12.917 --> 02:23:14.619
NOTION OF HAVING STUDENTS

02:23:14.686 --> 02:23:16.287
PERSIST AND GET THEIR DEGREE AT

02:23:16.354 --> 02:23:17.822
THE SAME TIME BEING ABLE TO GET

02:23:17.889 --> 02:23:18.957
THE COURSES THAT THEY NEED IN

02:23:19.023 --> 02:23:20.992
ORDER TO GRADUATE.

02:23:21.059 --> 02:23:21.592
AT THE TIME THAT THEY WANT TO

02:23:21.659 --> 02:23:22.126
GRADUATE.

02:23:22.193 --> 02:23:23.761
IDEALLY IF THEY WANT TO GRADUATE

02:23:23.828 --> 02:23:26.331
IN FOUR THEY AT GRADUATE FORTY

02:23:26.397 --> 02:23:27.398
ONE GRADUATE THREE THREE IF IT'S

02:23:27.465 --> 02:23:29.767
IF THEY'RE ON THE SIX YEAR PLAN

02:23:29.834 --> 02:23:30.134
INTENTIONALLY.

02:23:30.201 --> 02:23:31.970
THERE IS WELL.

02:23:32.036 --> 02:23:33.471
NOW THE GRANITE SHOULD HAVE DOES

02:23:33.538 --> 02:23:34.939
A NUMBER OF THINGS IN TERMS OF

02:23:35.006 --> 02:23:36.207
FUNDING IT LIKE I MENTIONED IT

02:23:36.274 --> 02:23:37.742
IT ADDS ADDITIONAL COURSES SO

02:23:37.809 --> 02:23:40.211
THAT WE CAN HAVE MORE STUDENTS.

02:23:40.278 --> 02:23:41.446
HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE

02:23:41.512 --> 02:23:42.880
MORE THAN THE AVERAGE WHICH IS

02:23:42.947 --> 02:23:44.816
ABOUT THIRTEEN POINT THREE UNITS

02:23:44.882 --> 02:23:46.884
PER TERM NOW IF YOU DO THE MATH

02:23:46.951 --> 02:23:48.619
YOU NOT GONNA GRADUATE IN FOUR

02:23:48.686 --> 02:23:49.787
YEARS IF EVERYBODY WAS IN THAT

02:23:49.854 --> 02:23:51.556
SITUATION.

02:23:51.622 --> 02:23:52.123
SO THAT'S ONE OF THE MAJOR

02:23:52.190 --> 02:23:54.792
TENANTS THE OTHER PIECE OF IT.

02:23:54.859 --> 02:23:55.760
IS.

02:23:55.827 --> 02:23:57.095

02:24:07.805 --> 02:24:09.140
SO WE ARE TRYING TO DO SOME OF

02:24:09.207 --> 02:24:10.842
THAT AND CAMPUSES HAVE PLANS IN

02:24:10.908 --> 02:24:12.543
ACTION SO THAT THEY CAN.

02:24:12.610 --> 02:24:14.412
DO ALL OF THIS TRY TO ATTEMPT TO

02:24:14.479 --> 02:24:15.913
DO ALL OF THIS THE KNOCKING AT

02:24:15.980 --> 02:24:16.581
THE NOT GONNA MEET EVERY SINGLE

02:24:16.647 --> 02:24:17.682
NEED THOUGH THAT'S JUST NOT THE

02:24:17.749 --> 02:24:19.450
REALITY THAT'S NOT.

02:24:19.517 --> 02:24:20.084
THAT'S THAT'S NOT THE WORLD WE

02:24:20.151 --> 02:24:21.052
LIVE IN.

02:24:21.119 --> 02:24:22.420
BUT I THINK WE WE WILL GET THERE

02:24:22.487 --> 02:24:23.721
THE OTHER THING TOO THAT IF YOU

02:24:23.788 --> 02:24:25.023
IF YOU ARE SUPPORTIVE OF THAT

02:24:25.089 --> 02:24:26.324
ADDITIONAL FIFTEEN MILLION

02:24:26.391 --> 02:24:27.692
DOLLARS.

02:24:27.759 --> 02:24:29.394
THAT HAS BEEN PROPOSED BY THE

02:24:29.460 --> 02:24:30.895
ADMINISTRATION WHICH IS.

02:24:30.962 --> 02:24:32.230
COMPLETELY DOVE TAILS AND WHAT

02:24:32.296 --> 02:24:33.698
THE TRUSTEES REQUEST.

02:24:33.765 --> 02:24:35.266
IT'S FIFTEEN MILLION ONE TIME

02:24:35.333 --> 02:24:36.734
FOR BASIC NEEDS INITIATIVES.

02:24:36.801 --> 02:24:37.769
AND SO THAT'S ANOTHER

02:24:37.835 --> 02:24:39.470
OPPORTUNITY IN WHICH WE ARE

02:24:39.537 --> 02:24:41.739
TRYING TO IT ATTEMPT. TO MEET A

02:24:41.806 --> 02:24:43.107
LOT OF THESE NEED SO IT'S IT'S

02:24:43.174 --> 02:24:44.776
ALSO HOUSING BUT IT'S ALSO

02:24:44.842 --> 02:24:46.177
MAKING SURE THAT STUDENTS HAVE

02:24:46.244 --> 02:24:47.712
HAVE AN AWARENESS AND HAVE THAT

02:24:47.779 --> 02:24:49.547
CONNECTION. TO A LOT OF OTHER

02:24:49.614 --> 02:24:52.483
SOCIAL SERVICES THAT WE HAVE.

02:24:52.550 --> 02:24:53.651
ESTABLISHED THROUGHOUT THE STATE

02:24:53.718 --> 02:24:55.153
AT THE COUNTY LEVEL THE LOCAL

02:24:55.219 --> 02:24:57.355
LEVEL AND IN THE PHILANTHROPIC

02:24:57.422 --> 02:24:59.891
WORLD -- WE ARE PERFECTLY

02:24:59.957 --> 02:25:01.592
ALIGNED WITH EVERY SINGLE ENTITY

02:25:01.659 --> 02:25:03.361
THAT THAT CAN HELP STUDENTS WITH

02:25:03.428 --> 02:25:04.629
EXISTING MONIES THAT ARE ALREADY

02:25:04.695 --> 02:25:05.963
BUDGETED OUT THERE AND IN THE

02:25:06.030 --> 02:25:06.864
STATE BUDGET.

02:25:06.931 --> 02:25:08.833
AND SO THAT'S WHAT A LOT OF THAT

02:25:08.900 --> 02:25:09.534
FIFTEEN MILLION WILL DO IS

02:25:09.600 --> 02:25:12.603
MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE MORE OF

02:25:12.670 --> 02:25:12.804
THAT.

02:25:12.870 --> 02:25:13.838
CAN ACTIVITY.

02:25:13.905 --> 02:25:14.639
OF OUR STUDENTS WITH THE

02:25:14.705 --> 02:25:19.544
SERVICES THAT THEY NEED IN

02:25:19.610 --> 02:25:19.844
PARTICULAR.

02:25:19.911 --> 02:25:20.445
SO I THINK.

02:25:20.511 --> 02:25:21.079
ADOPTING THE THE BUDGET REQUEST

02:25:21.145 --> 02:25:23.314
AS WE'VE LAID OUT IS A LONG IS

02:25:23.381 --> 02:25:25.416
IS IS MILES AHEAD OF WHERE WE

02:25:25.483 --> 02:25:26.451
WOULD BE.

02:25:26.517 --> 02:25:27.251
BECAUSE YOU'RE ADDING MONEY ON

02:25:27.318 --> 02:25:28.519
GRANITE SHOULD BE ADDING MONEY

02:25:28.586 --> 02:25:29.754
ON BASIC NEEDS.

02:25:29.821 --> 02:25:30.788
AND THEN IF YOU DO WANT TO

02:25:30.855 --> 02:25:32.457
CONSIDER ADDITIONAL FUNDS LIKE

02:25:32.523 --> 02:25:32.957
PROPOSED BY THE IN THE

02:25:33.024 --> 02:25:35.026
ADMINISTRATION I MEAN THAT'S

02:25:35.093 --> 02:25:36.761
THAT'S IN ADDITION TO IN WOULD

02:25:36.828 --> 02:25:38.196
BE BE SUPPLEMENTAL TO AND AND

02:25:38.262 --> 02:25:40.665
ULTIMATELY WOULD BE WOULD BE --

02:25:40.731 --> 02:25:45.903
SATISFIED WITH THAT AS WELL.

02:25:45.970 --> 02:25:48.206

GALLAGHER TO HAVE ANY QUESTIONS.

02:25:50.842 --> 02:25:52.410
SO WHAT I'M SORRY I MISSED SOME

AND THEN HAS AND MAYBE YOU

02:28:58.262 --> 02:28:58.829
ALREADY ANSWERED THIS RATE HAS

02:28:58.896 --> 02:28:59.664
THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE

02:28:59.730 --> 02:29:03.334
ALLOCATED IN THE ON GOING FUNDS --

02:29:03.401 --> 02:29:07.305
FOR THE SUPPORT OF THIS PROGRAM.

02:29:07.371 --> 02:29:09.006
ARE THESE PROGRAM IN THIS

02:29:09.073 --> 02:29:11.242
PARTICULAR CASE -- NOT FROM THE

02:29:11.309 --> 02:29:13.010
CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE PER SE --

02:29:13.077 --> 02:29:15.079
I'M NOT AWARE THAT PERHAPS IN

02:29:15.146 --> 02:29:17.014
BERNIE DINO HAS CONTRIBUTED SOME

02:29:17.081 --> 02:29:19.050
OF THEIR OPRY BUDGET FROM THEIR

02:29:19.116 --> 02:29:20.518
CAMPUS BUT I'M UNAWARE

02:29:20.584 --> 02:29:22.086
SPECIFICALLY WHAT IF ANY WHAT

02:29:22.153 --> 02:29:24.455
ABOUT FOR PROJECT REBOUND I

02:29:24.522 --> 02:29:25.723
THINK THAT WAS OF THAT THOSE

02:29:25.790 --> 02:29:27.992
MEXICO YEAH YEAH THERE'S WHAT WE

02:29:28.059 --> 02:29:29.994
HAVE IN PLACE IS ABOUT.

02:29:30.061 --> 02:29:32.630
I THINK IT'S ABOUT THREE HUNDRED

02:29:32.697 --> 02:29:33.230
THOUSAND DOLLARS THAT WE HAVE

02:29:33.297 --> 02:29:37.168
COMMITTED ON A MULTI YEAR BASIS --

02:29:37.234 --> 02:29:38.636
TO PROJECT REBOUND -- FROM THE

02:29:38.703 --> 02:29:40.905
CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE ALSO --

02:29:40.971 --> 02:29:43.174
THERE'S INDIVIDUAL CAMPUSES ARE

02:29:43.240 --> 02:29:45.810
ARE CONTRIBUTING VERY SMALL.

02:29:45.876 --> 02:29:47.311
AMOUNTS IN THE TENS OF THOUSANDS

02:29:47.378 --> 02:29:48.512
OF DOLLARS.

02:29:48.579 --> 02:29:50.214
ON THEIR FROM THEIR PARTICULAR --

02:29:50.281 --> 02:29:51.549
OPERATING BUT SUPPORT THE

02:29:51.615 --> 02:29:54.218
PROGRAM I THINK OVERALL -- THE

02:29:54.285 --> 02:29:56.053
THE PROGRAMS ABOUT ONE ONE

02:29:56.120 --> 02:29:58.089
MILLION ONE POINT TWO MILLION

02:29:58.155 --> 02:30:00.491
PER YEAR -- THE VAST MAJORITY OF

02:30:00.558 --> 02:30:03.361
THAT MONEY THOUGH IS IS HAS BEEN --

02:30:03.427 --> 02:30:05.529
HAS BEEN FROM -- THIS PARTICULAR

02:30:05.596 --> 02:30:07.631
PHILANTHROPIC ENTITY.

02:30:07.698 --> 02:30:09.533
THAT MONEY IS EXPIRING SOON AND

02:30:09.600 --> 02:30:11.235
SO WHAT YOU HAVE HERE IS YOU

02:30:11.302 --> 02:30:13.604

02:30:19.543 --> 02:30:20.845
FUNDING WHEN THAT WHEN WE DO THE

02:30:20.911 --> 02:30:22.813
MATH ON THAT THEY MADE YOU KNOW

02:30:22.880 --> 02:30:24.281
TURN OUT THAT IT'S YOU KNOW.

02:30:24.348 --> 02:30:25.950
A LITTLE BIT MORE MONEY THAT

02:30:26.016 --> 02:30:27.318
COULD BE INVESTMENT PROGRAM.

02:30:27.385 --> 02:30:28.319
I THINK WE HAVE ABOUT EIGHT

02:30:28.386 --> 02:30:29.620
CAMPUSES IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN OF

02:30:29.687 --> 02:30:31.756

LARGEST PROGRAM IS AT SAN

02:30:35.326 --> 02:30:36.994
FRANCISCO STATE AND THERE ARE

OTHER CAMPUSES THAT OR I JUST

02:30:38.863 --> 02:30:39.597

OTHER CAMPUSES THAT ARE

02:30:44.735 --> 02:30:45.336
DEFINITELY INTERESTED BECAUSE OF

02:30:45.403 --> 02:30:46.270
THAT.

02:30:46.337 --> 02:30:48.439
THE GREAT SUCCESS THAT THAT HAS

02:30:48.506 --> 02:30:51.442
BEEN SHOWN AT SEVERAL SCHOOLS

02:30:51.509 --> 02:30:54.345
STATE OTHER EXISTING PROGRAMS.

02:30:54.412 --> 02:30:56.781
IN THIS ROOM REALLY QUICKLY.

02:30:56.847 --> 02:30:57.982
SO MY EYES OF INITIAL COMMENTS

02:30:58.048 --> 02:30:58.616
THERE IS THAT IS THAT A PRETTY

02:30:58.682 --> 02:30:59.650
GOOD.

02:30:59.717 --> 02:31:01.986
SYNTHESIS OF WHAT YOU GUYS HER

02:31:02.052 --> 02:31:03.621
SANE WITH REGARD TO TAKE

02:31:03.687 --> 02:31:04.855
COMPLIMENTS ANY DAY.

02:31:04.922 --> 02:31:05.523
YEAH BUT I MEAN BUT AS A AS AT A

02:31:05.589 --> 02:31:07.425
SYNTHESIS OF WHAT YOU GUYS ARE

02:31:07.491 --> 02:31:10.094
ASKING ESSENTIALLY THAT HEY

02:31:10.161 --> 02:31:10.494
DON'T.

02:31:10.561 --> 02:31:12.062
WE ARE ALREADY DOING THIS.

02:31:12.129 --> 02:31:13.531
DON'T TARGET THIS MONEY IF IF WE

02:31:13.597 --> 02:31:14.665
COULD HAVE SOME MORE FLEXIBILITY

02:31:14.732 --> 02:31:16.100
AND HAVE THIS MONEY GO TOWARDS

02:31:16.167 --> 02:31:17.535
OUR CORE PROGRAM I THINK I THINK

02:31:17.601 --> 02:31:19.236
FUNDAMENTALLY ARE OUR POSITION

02:31:19.303 --> 02:31:21.138
IS THAT THE MORE FLEXIBILITY

02:31:21.205 --> 02:31:22.106
PROVIDE THE UNIVERSITY OF MORE

02:31:22.173 --> 02:31:23.841
WE CAN PIVOT AND DO THINGS THAT

02:31:23.908 --> 02:31:24.742
ARE.

02:31:24.809 --> 02:31:25.676
UNIQUE NOT ONLY FROM A UNIQUE

02:31:25.743 --> 02:31:27.812
PERSPECTIVE BUT ALSO COULD BE

02:31:27.878 --> 02:31:30.147
MORE COST EFFECTIVE POTENTIALLY --

02:31:30.214 --> 02:31:32.650
SO I WOULD SAY ONE EXAMPLE IS TO

02:31:32.716 --> 02:31:34.118
THE GRAD THE GRADUATION ISSUED

02:31:34.185 --> 02:31:37.087
OF WHAT WHAT CAMPUS IS DO AS

02:31:37.154 --> 02:31:38.656
THEY ESTABLISH A PLAN.

02:31:38.722 --> 02:31:39.857
AT THEIR LEVEL OF WHAT THEY ARE

02:31:39.924 --> 02:31:41.292
INTENDING TO DO.

02:31:41.358 --> 02:31:43.694
AND WHAT HAPPENS IS SOMETIMES --

02:31:43.761 --> 02:31:45.196
AND WE'VE ALREADY SEEN THIS

02:31:45.262 --> 02:31:46.730
HAPPEN WHERE THEY HAVE ACTUALLY

02:31:46.797 --> 02:31:47.698
PIVOTED.

02:31:47.765 --> 02:31:50.201
AND HAVE DECIDED WELL WE HAVE WE

02:31:50.267 --> 02:31:52.636
HAVE INVESTED IN THIS SO FAR AND

02:31:52.703 --> 02:31:53.938
WE ARE NOW WANTING TO PAY THAT

02:31:54.004 --> 02:31:55.573
AND AND INVEST A LITTLE BIT MORE.

02:31:55.639 --> 02:31:58.242
FOR EXAMPLE ON ONE CAMPUS THAT

02:31:58.309 --> 02:31:59.710
THE REAL DETRIMENT AT ON THE

02:31:59.777 --> 02:32:01.278
CAMPUS WAS A LACK OF ECONOMIC

02:32:01.345 --> 02:32:02.680
COUNSELING.

02:32:02.746 --> 02:32:04.014
RIGHT A GRAND ISSUED IF THE

02:32:04.081 --> 02:32:04.582
FUNDING THAT YOU PROVIDED

02:32:04.648 --> 02:32:06.016
BASICALLY SO HERE'S A BUNCH OF

02:32:06.083 --> 02:32:07.084
MONEY CAMPUS IS YOU DECIDE

02:32:07.151 --> 02:32:08.619

CAMPUS SO THIS PARTICULAR CAMPUS

02:32:10.654 --> 02:32:12.289
SAID WE HAVE WE WE NEED MORE

02:32:12.356 --> 02:32:13.691
ACADEMIC COUNSELORS TO ADVISE

02:32:13.757 --> 02:32:15.793
STUDENTS ON THE BEST PATH TO

02:32:15.860 --> 02:32:16.694
DEGREE.

02:32:16.760 --> 02:32:18.128
OKAY FIRST YEAR THEY PUMP IT ALL

02:32:18.195 --> 02:32:19.964
INTO THEIR QUE ALL THEIR MONEY

02:32:20.030 --> 02:32:23.434
GOES INTO ECONOMIC COUNSELING.

02:32:23.501 --> 02:32:24.001
SECOND YEAR GRAD MISSION OF

02:32:24.068 --> 02:32:24.869
FUNDING.

02:32:24.935 --> 02:32:26.403
THEY INVESTED ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY

02:32:26.470 --> 02:32:28.138
IN ADDITIONAL FACULTY SO NOW WE

02:32:28.205 --> 02:32:30.508
HAVE CANCERS IN PLACE WHICH IS A

02:32:30.574 --> 02:32:31.709
IN AN INCREDIBLE.

02:32:31.775 --> 02:32:33.377
LACK ON OUR CAMPUS AND NOW WE'RE

02:32:33.444 --> 02:32:34.478
GOING TO ADD MORE COURSE

SECTIONS BECAUSE AS WE NEED TO

02:32:35.179 --> 02:32:36.213
DO.

02:32:36.280 --> 02:32:38.015
AND SO CAMPUSES ARE ARE ARE HAVE

02:32:38.082 --> 02:32:39.650
PLANS IN PLACE TO REALLY PUT

02:32:39.717 --> 02:32:41.252
MORE AND MORE MONEY IN STRATEGIC

02:32:41.318 --> 02:32:42.086
AREAS.

02:32:42.152 --> 02:32:42.786
IF YOU DON'T HAVE THAT

02:32:42.853 --> 02:32:44.889
FLEXIBILITY IF THE LEGISLATURE

OR THE GOVERNOR DECIDE THAT YOU

02:32:46.657 --> 02:32:47.925
KNOW ALL THIS MONEY SHOULD BE

02:32:47.992 --> 02:32:48.926
THIS WAY AND ALL THIS MONEY

02:32:48.993 --> 02:32:50.227
SHOULD BE THAT WAY.

02:32:50.294 --> 02:32:51.328
THE CHALLENGES THAN THAN

02:32:51.395 --> 02:32:53.397
CAMPUSES CAN'T PAY THAT THEY

02:32:53.464 --> 02:32:54.398
HAVE TO SPEND MONEY.

02:32:54.465 --> 02:32:55.432
POR BUNCH MONEY INTO SOMETHING

02:32:55.499 --> 02:32:57.568
THAT MIGHT BE GOOD BUT AT THE

02:32:57.635 --> 02:32:58.569
COST OF SOMETHING ELSE THAT MAY

02:32:58.636 --> 02:33:00.571
BE A CHALLENGE SO WE ARE ALWAYS

02:33:00.638 --> 02:33:03.274

LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE SO

02:37:51.195 --> 02:37:52.262
WE HAVE SOME COMMENTS ON TWO OF

02:37:52.329 --> 02:37:53.730
THE OF THE PROPOSES MOMMY

02:37:53.797 --> 02:37:54.698
REVISION.

02:37:54.765 --> 02:37:56.667
FIRST REGARDING THE PROPOSAL TO

02:37:56.733 --> 02:37:58.101
EXTEND THE HOLD HARMLESS

02:37:58.168 --> 02:37:59.236
PROVISION FOR A FOURTH YEAR.

02:37:59.303 --> 02:38:00.571
AND WE WOULD RECOMMEND REJECTING

02:38:00.637 --> 02:38:01.805
THIS PROPOSAL WE DON'T THINK

02:38:01.872 --> 02:38:03.307
THERE'S ANY NEED TO EXTEND THE

02:38:03.373 --> 02:38:04.842
PRISON RIGHT NOW.

02:38:04.908 --> 02:38:07.110
THE THE AS THE ADMINISTRATION --

02:38:07.177 --> 02:38:08.912
NOTED THAT THEY ARE NOT --

02:38:08.979 --> 02:38:10.414
PURSUING ANY MAJOR CHANGES TO

02:38:10.480 --> 02:38:11.548
THE FORM OF THAT THIS TIME AND

02:38:11.615 --> 02:38:13.617
MOST OF THE CHANGES THAT ARE

02:38:13.684 --> 02:38:15.085
INCLUDED IN THE MIRROR VISION.

02:38:15.152 --> 02:38:16.220
WE WOULD ARGUE ARE ACTUALLY

02:38:16.286 --> 02:38:17.921
CREATE MORE STABILITY IN IN IN

02:38:17.988 --> 02:38:19.256
THE FORMULA SO WE WE DON'T THINK

02:38:19.323 --> 02:38:20.424
THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY A

02:38:20.490 --> 02:38:21.625
REASON TO EXTERNAL HARM IS AT

02:38:21.692 --> 02:38:22.626
THIS TIME.

02:38:22.693 --> 02:38:24.361
THAT THE EXTENDING IT DOES

02:38:24.428 --> 02:38:25.829
CREATE SOME COST PRESSURE IN

02:38:25.896 --> 02:38:26.930
THAT FOURTH YEAR.

02:38:26.997 --> 02:38:29.299
AND SO -- IT'S PROBABLY BECAUSE

02:38:29.366 --> 02:38:30.334
PRESSURE BUT PROBABLY IN THE

02:38:30.400 --> 02:38:31.101
TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS SO

02:38:31.168 --> 02:38:31.635
WE DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY

02:38:31.702 --> 02:38:33.670
REASON TO DO THAT NOW IF IN

02:38:33.737 --> 02:38:35.272
JANUARY WITH THERE IS A PROPOSAL

02:38:35.339 --> 02:38:36.440
FOR A BIGGER FORMER BIGGER

02:38:36.506 --> 02:38:37.941
CHANGES WE THINK AT THAT TIME

02:38:38.008 --> 02:38:39.409
YOU COULD CONSIDER.

02:38:39.476 --> 02:38:40.210
WHETHER YOU WANTED TO EXTEND

02:38:40.277 --> 02:38:41.278
THAT.

02:38:41.345 --> 02:38:43.313
IN TERMS OF THE STATE OPERATIONS --

02:38:43.380 --> 02:38:44.481
WE HAVE NO SPECIFIC CONCERNS

02:38:44.548 --> 02:38:45.949
WITH THE PARTICULAR POSITIONS

02:38:46.016 --> 02:38:46.884
BUT WE DO CONTINUE HAVE SOME

02:38:46.950 --> 02:38:49.753
CONCERNS THAT WITH TRANSPARENCY

02:38:49.820 --> 02:38:51.121
FROM THE CHANCES OF AND HOW IT

02:38:51.188 --> 02:38:51.488
HAS.

02:38:51.555 --> 02:38:53.290
SPENT MORE RECENT AUGMENTATIONS

02:38:53.357 --> 02:38:54.658

02:38:56.460 --> 02:38:57.027
AUGMENTATIONS OF THE LAST COUPLE

02:38:57.094 --> 02:38:58.395

02:38:58.462 --> 02:38:58.996
OF THE DATE WE DON'T HAVE ANY

02:38:59.062 --> 02:38:59.196
CáC.

02:38:59.263 --> 02:39:00.397
CLEAR INDICATION OF HOW THOSE

02:39:00.464 --> 02:39:03.367
POSITIONS HAVE BEEN USED AS A

02:39:03.433 --> 02:39:04.434
WITH OTHER INFORMATION WERE

02:39:04.501 --> 02:39:05.002
CONCERNED THAT ANY FURTHER

02:39:05.068 --> 02:39:06.803
AUGMENTATIONS MIGHT NOT BE USED

02:39:06.870 --> 02:39:09.072
FOR THE INTENDED PURPOSES SO --

02:39:09.139 --> 02:39:12.209
OUR RECOMMENDATION -- WOULD BE

02:39:12.276 --> 02:39:13.043

YEAR UNIVERSITY WE THINK THAT

02:42:28.038 --> 02:42:29.172
THERE IS AN ALTERNATIVE

02:42:29.239 --> 02:42:30.640
DEFINITION THAT ACCOMPLISHES THE

02:42:31.942 --> 02:42:33.376
PREFERABLE WITH REGARD TO

THAT THRESHOLD -- IN ORDER TO

02:42:46.089 --> 02:42:47.524
GENERATE THE TRANSFER OUTCOME

02:42:47.591 --> 02:42:48.625
AND THEN THERE'S AN EXISTING

02:42:48.692 --> 02:42:50.160

02:55:47.970 --> 02:55:49.305
HIGHER AT THINGS MARKET TWELVE

02:55:49.372 --> 02:55:50.640
THING BUT THIS IS A FINANCIALLY

02:55:50.706 --> 02:55:52.775
PROGRAM SO I THINK IT THING HERE

02:55:52.842 --> 02:55:54.377
TO TO REALIZE IS IS TWO THINGS.

02:55:54.443 --> 02:55:55.511
ONE THERE'S TEACHERS WHO

02:55:55.578 --> 02:55:56.712
GRADUATE WITH A TREMENDOUS

02:55:56.779 --> 02:55:57.980
AMOUNT.

02:55:58.047 --> 02:55:59.782
OF OF DEBT.

02:55:59.849 --> 02:56:00.983
AND HAVE THAT JUST A TOUGH TIME.

02:56:01.050 --> 02:56:02.652
ENTERING THE WORK FORCE AND YOU

02:56:02.718 --> 02:56:07.223
KNOW MAKING A GO OF IT THERE IS

02:56:07.290 --> 02:56:08.124
THIS -- YEAH.

02:56:08.190 --> 02:56:09.458
I OPENING REPORT I THINK IN ONE

02:56:09.525 --> 02:56:10.526
OF THE EAST BAY NEWSPAPERS A FEW

02:56:10.593 --> 02:56:11.060
WEEKS AGO WHAT ALL THESE

02:56:11.127 --> 02:56:12.061
TEACHERS WHO ARE.

02:56:12.128 --> 02:56:13.696
FRANKLY LIVING WITH THEIR MOM OR

02:56:13.763 --> 02:56:15.064
GRANDMA OR TRIPLING OR

02:56:15.131 --> 02:56:17.166
QUADRUPLING UP IN AN APARTMENT

02:56:17.233 --> 02:56:17.433
AND JUST.

02:56:17.500 --> 02:56:19.535
YOU KNOW HAVING A DIFFICULT TIME

02:56:19.602 --> 02:56:20.970
LEADING NORMAL LIVES WITH

02:56:21.037 --> 02:56:22.738
FRANKLY A GREAT JOB A GOOD

02:56:22.805 --> 02:56:24.240
PAYING JOB -- WHEN THE MOST

02:56:24.307 --> 02:56:25.775
IMPORTANT JOBS IN SOCIETY IT OUT

02:56:25.841 --> 02:56:26.509
OF A TEACHER?

02:56:26.575 --> 02:56:28.244
AND SO THAT'S AN ISSUE THAT

02:56:28.311 --> 02:56:29.912
WE'RE LOOKING TO ADDRESS AS FAR

02:56:29.979 --> 02:56:31.113
AS THE FINANCIAL PIECE OF THAT.

02:56:31.180 --> 02:56:33.516
BUT THE OTHER THING AS FAR AS

02:56:33.582 --> 02:56:35.418
THE NEED TO GET MORE TEACHERS IN

02:56:35.484 --> 02:56:37.119
THE WORK FORCE AND FRANKLY

02:56:37.186 --> 02:56:38.454
WORKING IN.

02:56:38.521 --> 02:56:40.723
SCHOOLS WHERE WE NEED THE MOST

02:56:40.790 --> 02:56:42.792
HELP BECAUSE YOU KNOW FRANKLY IF

02:56:42.858 --> 02:56:44.026
THERE WERE SIX IF THEY'RE A

02:56:44.093 --> 02:56:45.127
BUNCH OF AN CREDENTIALED

02:56:45.194 --> 02:56:46.796
TEACHERS IN THE SCHOOL OR MY

02:56:46.862 --> 02:56:48.497
KIDS GO TO SCHOOL.

02:56:48.564 --> 02:56:49.632
NOW THE PARENTS WOULD HAVE A

02:56:49.699 --> 02:56:50.633
REVOLT AND THEY'D BE IN THE

02:56:50.700 --> 02:56:52.134
DISTRICT OFFICES WILL THAT

02:56:52.201 --> 02:56:53.636
HAPPEN BUT THE T. TO SCHOOLS IN

02:56:53.703 --> 02:56:55.137
OUR IN A FIVE MILES SOUTH OF

02:56:55.204 --> 02:56:56.539
HERE LOWER INCOME NEIGHBORHOODS

02:56:56.605 --> 02:56:57.940
IS JUST THAT IT IS WHAT IT IS

02:56:58.007 --> 02:57:00.543
AND I THINK THAT'S AN ABSOLUTE.

02:57:00.609 --> 02:57:01.410
DISGRACE SO WE NEED TO MAKE SURE

02:57:01.477 --> 02:57:03.946
WE HAVE -- QUALIFIED TEACHERS SO

02:57:04.013 --> 02:57:07.450
I GUESS THE ISSUE THAT I'M WE'RE

02:57:07.516 --> 02:57:09.151
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT.

02:57:09.218 --> 02:57:09.752
IS THAT.

02:57:09.819 --> 02:57:10.586
THIS SOUNDS LIKE AT A REASONABLE

02:57:10.653 --> 02:57:11.520
PROPOSAL BUT YOU KNOW IS THIS

02:57:11.587 --> 02:57:15.291
THE BEST ONE TO ADDRESS THOSE --

02:57:15.358 --> 02:57:16.792
TWO THOSE ISSUES -- THAT THEIR

02:57:16.859 --> 02:57:18.627
