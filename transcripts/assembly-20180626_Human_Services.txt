AND SENATOR ITCHELL YOU HAVEN'T THANK YOU VERY MUCH I DO HAVE ANOTHER BILL MA'AM I APPRECIATE IT [inaudible] THANK YOU. WHEN WE BEGIN OF THE NEXT BILL ON MADAM CHAIR OF SENATE BILL TEN EIGHTY THREE ON DEALING WITH THAT THE RESOURCE FAMILY? ON A LIKE TO START OFF BY ACCEPTING THE RECOMMENDED COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS ARE REFLECTED ON PAGES SEVEN EIGHT OF YOUR COMMITTEE ANALYSIS AND THANKING THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR HELP WITH THIS. IT'S A MEASURE THAT WILL STRENGTHEN THE INTENT OF THE CONTINUUM OF CARE ALSO KNOWN AS THE FEE FI ARE -- INITIATIVE -- ESTABLISHED BY THE LEGISLATION AND ON BY THE ADMINISTRATION WERE HOPING TO ADDRESS IMPLEMENTATION HURDLES IN THE RESOURCE FAMILY APPROVAL THE RFA PROCESS. AS YOU ALL MAY REMEMBER THE CCR IS AIMED AT ENSURING THAT ALL CHILDREN ARE RAISED AND STABLE IN SUPPORT OF HOMES AND WHILE THE RFA PROCESS HELP. HELP TO ACHIEVE THAT VISION IN SEVERAL WAYS IT CREATES A MORE THOROUGH PROCESS FOR VETTING POTENTIAL FAMILY PLACEMENTS IN THE CYCLE OF MULTI HOME PLACEMENTS FOR YOUTH IN FOSTER CARE. AND GROUPON SETTINGS. AND WHILE I STRONGLY BELIEVE IN THIS NEW DIRECTION FOR OUR CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM THIS TRANSITION HAS NOT BEEN EASY WE ARE FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE OUR APPROACH TO CHILD PLACEMENTS. AS WITH ANY KNEW PROCESS WE ARE LEARNING BY DOING IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN WE IMPLEMENT THE RFA PROCESS AND WE NOW NO WHICH AREAS THAT NEED ATTENTION IN ORDER TO ADEQUATELY SUPPORT YOUTH IN FOSTER CARE AND THE CARE GIVERS WHO STEP FOR THEM. CURRENTLY THE RFA PROCESS TAKE FAR LONGER THAN THE ORIGINAL ESTIMATE NINETY DAYS TO COMPLETE. AS OF DECEMBER TWENTY SEVENTEEN ABOUT 40% OF RESOURCE FOUND THE APPLICANTS TOOK LONGER THAN NINETY DAYS TO COMPLETE. PROBLEM WITH THAT MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THAT FAMILIES ARE GOING MONTHS BEFORE BEING APPROVED AS A RESOURCE FAMILY AND ARE THEREFORE NOT RECEIVING ANY FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE FOR TAKING THE CHILD. S. BEATEN AB THREE WILL ADDRESS THESE IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES IN THE FOLLOWING WAYS FIRST WE'RE CLARIFYING THE POTENTIAL CAREGIVER TO START THE RFP PROCESS BUT WITHDREW THE APPLICATION MAY PICK UP WHERE THEY LEFT OFF WITHIN A TWELVE MONTH PERIOD. COUNTY WELFARE DEPARTMENT MAY REQUEST UPDATED INFORMATION FOR KEY FROM CARE GIVERS IN THESE INSTANCES. WE'RE ENSURING THAT A YOUTH CAN'T CONTINUE TO BE PLACED WITH A RELATIVE WORK THEN THE FAMILY MEMBER THROUGH VOLUNTARY PLACEMENT AGREEMENT OF EPA'S WITHOUT. THE RELATIVE HAVING TO FIRST BE APPROVED AND WAIT FOR THE MULTI MONTH RFA PROCESS TO BE COMPLETED. ALLOWING FOR THE MONTHS THAT A CHILD SPENT IN IN A HOME PRIOR TO THE FALL ARE FAKE COMPLETION OF THE RELATIVE TO ACCOUNT FOR THE SIX MONTH CAN GET REQUIREMENTS. SO THAT THE RELATIVE MAY RECEIVE FUNDING AND AVOID DELAYS TO PERMANENCY FOR YOU. AGAIN THE ULTIMATE GOAL IS TO TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT FAMILIES OF STEPPED UP BOTH RELATIVE AND NON RELATIVE WHO ARE WILLING TO TAKE A CHILD INTO THEIR HOME. THAT THEY NOT BE PENALIZED BY NOT RECEIVING. REIMBURSEMENTS -- WHILE THE RFA PRODUCT IS BEING COMPLETED THERE SOME OTHER TECHNICAL FIXES IN TERMS OF THE AMOUNT OF TIME WHERE ALLOWING COUNTIES TO COMPLETE THE PROCESS. ABA WITH THAT WITH ME HERE TODAY IS A LEASE WEINBERG RIPPING THE ALLIANCE FOR CHILDREN'S RIGHTS ADELINE JUST LOOK FOR A CARE GIVER FROM WOODLAND WHO WENT THROUGH THE RFA PROCESS THINK AND TELL US FIRSTHAND. HOW COMPLICATED THE SYSTEM AS A BEFORE WE CONTINUE -- SENATOR I KNOW MY OFFICE CONTACTED YOU ARE IN ADDITION TO THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS LISTED AND THE ANALYSIS THERE WILL BE ADDITIONAL I'LL COME CONFORMING AMENDMENTS PER LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL -- EMPLOYED THESE AMENDMENTS ENSURE THAT ALL FOSTER FAMILIES INCLUDING BILL CERTIFIED BY FOSTER FAMILY AGENCIES AND LICENSED BY COUNTIES ARE TREATED EQUALLY. AND I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT LINE WITH THAT VOCAL IT IS MAKING SURE THAT THOSE WHO GO THROUGH THE PROCESS EITHER THROUGH OUR FFA THROUGH THE COUNTY GET THE SAME YES ABSOLUTELY FINE WITH THAT THINK OF IT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND WELCOME. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS MY NAME IS ELISE WEINBERG I'M AN ATTORNEY WITH THE ALLIANCE FOR CHILDREN'S RIGHTS. CONTINUUM OF CARE IS A REFORM FOUNDED ON THE REALITY THAT CHILDREN DO BEST WHEN THEY ARE IN THE CARE OF THEIR RELATIVES AND OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS. SENATE BILL TEN AB THREE WOULD HELP ENSURE THAT THAT VISION BECOMES A REALITY FOR FAMILIES ACROSS THE STATE. SENATE BILL TEND TO BE VERY MAKES PRACTICAL IMPROVEMENTS TO THE RESOURCE FAMILY APPROVAL PROCESS IT EMPOWERS FAMILIES EXPERIENCING DELAYS. THAT ALLOWS CHILDREN TO ACHIEVE PERMANENCY FASTER AND IT REDUCES BARRIERS TO ENSURING THAT CHILDREN HAVE A TEMPORARY AND SAFE PLACE SPENT IN A TIME OF CRISIS. IN SHORT THIS BILL WOULD MAKE RESOURCE FAMILY APPROVAL MORE FAMILY FRIENDLY AND CHILD CENTERED JUST AS INTENDED AND I'M SO PLEASED TODAY TO BE JOINED BY A LONG DRESS WHEN FOR A GOOD SHARE HER STORY WE ARE J. BUT THANK YOU [inaudible] GOOD AFTERNOON. MY NAME IS SANDRA SWINFORD AND I AM HERE TODAY WITH MY HUSBAND AARON. HOW WE LIVE IN WOODLAND CALIFORNIA? ON JUNE FIRST. TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WE TOOK EMERGENCY PLACEMENT OF MY EX HUSBAND'S FOUR YEAR OLD DAUGHTER. HAS STARTED THEY ARE IF THEY PROCESS. WE HAVE LEARNED THAT THE CHILD HAD BEEN IN FOSTER CARE. FOR SIX MONTHS AND WAS LIVING WITH STRANGERS. WE IMMEDIATELY WANTED THE TOWEL TO COME LIVE WITH US. AND WAS WILLING TO DO ANYTHING TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN. MY HUSBAND WORKS SEVENTY HOURS A WEEK AND THE SELDOM HOME. IT IS VERY DIFFICULT FOR US TO TAKE CARE OF IN ADDITION A CHILD. ON TOP OF HER SON AND HER BABY. THE CHILD ALSO HAS BEHAVIORAL EACH WHOSE SO WEEKLY THERAPY APPOINTMENTS WERE NECESSARY. IN ADDITION TO PARENTAL VISITATIONS TWICE A WEEK. HOWEVER WE WERE ABLE TO DO IT WITH THE HELP OF MY SISTER. THE REQUIRED CLASSES WHERE HARDSHIP FOR MY HUSBAND. ALTHOUGH THE EDUCATION FROM THE REQUIRED CLASSES PROVIDE THE MOST IMPORTANT. TOOLS TO DEAL WITH THEIR CHILD. HE STILL HAD TO GIVE UP SEVEN DAYS. FROM WORK TO FULFILL THE REQUIREMENTS. MY THE REQUIRED CLASSES WHERE HARDSHIP FOR MY HUSBAND. WE ALSO COMPLETED THE REQUIRED INTERVIEWS THERE WERE NO ADDITIONAL CLASSES WE HAD TO TAKE. WE HAD DONE EVERYTHING WE HAD TO DO. HOWEVER WE STILL SOMEHOW MANAGED TO FALL THROUGH THE CRACKS. WE GAVE OLIVER REQUIRED DOCUMENTS TO OUR FIRST SOCIAL WORKER. WHO LEFT HER JOB AFTER A THREE MONTH? WHAT THE NEW SOCIAL WORKER TOOK HER PLACE? THERE WAS LOS PAPERWORK AND LONG DELAYS IN COMMUNICATION. SHE ASKED US FOR DOCUMENTS THAT WE HAD ALREADY SUBMITTED TO THE PRIOR SOCIAL WORKER SUCH A THIRD LETTERS OF RECOMMENDATION. I FELT LIKE WE WERE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PILE. IT TOOK OF NO MORE THAN THREE MONTHS TO SUBMIT EVERYTHING TO THE SOCIAL WORKER BUT IT TOOK SEVEN MONTHS FOR US TO BE IN THE POSITION TO BE APPROVED. ALL THE WHILE THE CHILD WAS MISSING OUT ON SUPPORTS AND SERVICES. FOSTER GET COULD HAVE OFFERED HER. EVEN THEN THERE WAS THEM ISCHEMIC MISCOMMUNICATION BY THE SOCIAL WORKER SAYING WE WERE APPROVED. AND ONLY TO FIND OUT AT A LATER POINT THAT WE WERE NOT NEVER APPROVED. THIS IT'S A VERY NON FAMILY PROCESS TO CAREGIVERS. THERE NEEDS TO BE ACCOUNTABILITY AND OVERSIGHT OF THE PROCESSES. S. B.. TEN EIGHTY THREE WILL ENSURE THE TIE THAT TELL WELL FIRST AGENCIES. ACCOUNTABLE TO A NINETY DAY TIME TIMELINE WHEN RELATIVES AND NON RELATED EXTENDED FAMILY MEMBERS ARE GOING THROUGH THE RFA PROCESS. IT WILL ALSO ALLOW THE COURT TO HAVE MORE OVERSIGHT OF THEIR RFA PROCESS. THE FAMILIES CAN GET THROUGH THEIR APPROVAL PROCESS QUICKER.

AND I AM CLEAR THAT THAT'S PROBABLY NOT THE NORM BUT WE SHOULDN'T -- HAVE A SYSTEM THAT HAVE SO MANY GAP THAT TOO MANY CHILDREN FAMILIES FALL THROUGH IT THAT'S THE FOCUS ON OF THIS BILL TO TRY TO CLOSE. ONE OF THOSE GAPS TO MAKE SURE THAT RESOURCES ARE AVAILABLE WHILE THE FAMILY IS PROVIDING CARE IT'S NOT SAYING THAT YOU DON'T GO THROUGH THE RFA PROCESS WITH THE WHOLE POINT OF OUR FATE. IS TO MAKE SURE THAT IT REALLY IS AN APPROPRIATE PLACEMENT IN THE EYES OF THE CHILD SO WE WOULD PROVIDE THE RESOURCES WHILE YOU'RE PROVIDING CARE OUGHT.

THANK YOU CAN CALL THE ROLL PLEASE [inaudible] RUBIO. REVEAL AYE DOCTOR CHOI. DOCTOR CHOI I HAVE I'M GONNA. MAIENSCHEIN [inaudible] THERE'S STONE. STONE AYE THURMOND. THURMOND AYE BILLS KEPT FORTITUDE THANK YOU THE BILL'S OFF WILL LEAVE THE ROLE OPEN FOR I MEAN MEMBERS TO ADD THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. CASE SENATOR GLAZIER WELCOME. YOU'RE IN A VERY BUSY DAY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS SOME HIGH HERE TO PRESENT THAT THIS BILL THAT GUARANTEES CAL WORKS BENEFITS TO CAL WORKS RECIPIENTS WHO MEET FEDERAL WORK REQUIREMENTS. NOW FEDERAL LAW SETS THE AMOUNT OF OUR SOMEONE RECEIVING CALVERT'S BENEFITS MUST WORK OR ATTEND SCHOOL. FOR EXAMPLE A SINGLE PARENT WITH A CHILD OVER THE AGE OF SIX MONTHS WORK TWENTY HOURS A WEEK. IN ORDER TO RECEIVE BENEFITS. IN CALIFORNIA CAL WORKS RECIPIENTS ARE REQUIRED TO DEVELOP. A WELFARE TO WORK PLAN. PUT THEM ON A PATH TO BECOME SELF SUFFICIENT. HOWEVER IF A RECIPIENT FINDS WORK BEFORE THEIR PLAN ALLOWS BEFORE THEIR PLAN ALLOWS. THEIR BENEFITS ARE REDUCED THROUGH A SANCTION. PER MONTH THE FUNDS ARE THEN REDUCE TO NAME A ALSO LOSE ACCESS TO OTHER VALUABLE SUPPORTIVE SERVICES SUCH AS CHILDCARE AND TRANSPORTATION. SOME COUNTIES ALLOW SANCTION CAO WORKS RECIPIENTS. DEMONSTRATE GOOD BECAUSE AND NOT COMPLYING WITH THEIR INTENDED PLAN THIS COMPLACENT UNFAIR BURDEN ON WORKING RECIPIENTS. THEY'RE USUALLY STARTING NEW JOBS THAT PREVENT THEM FROM MEETING WITH COUNTY WELFARE AGENCIES DURING BUSINESS HOURS IT'S ALSO DIFFICULT TO ASK FOR TIME OFF. FROM AN EMPLOYER IF THE EMPLOYEE IS NEW TO THE JOB. JUST LAST YEAR THEY DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES ARE VAGUE FOUND THAT THIRTEEN HUNDRED CAL WORKS RECIPIENTS ACROSS THE STATE WERE BEING SANCTIONED. EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE MEETING FEDERAL WORK REQUIREMENTS. THE SANCTION PROCESS CAN BE COUNTERPRODUCTIVE TO HELPING PEOPLE GET BACK ON THEIR FEET. PUNISH CAO WORKS RECIPIENTS FOR WORKING. AND DISCOURAGE THEM FROM FINDING EMPLOYMENT SOONER. THIS BILL GIVES CAL WORKS RECIPIENTS. DIFFERENT ROUTE TO GET BACK ON THEIR FEET WITHOUT BEING PUNISHED FOR DOING SO. SPILLS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION IT HAS BIPARTISAN SUPPORT AND RECEIVE NO NO VOTES THUS FAR AND I ENCOURAGE YOUR FAVORABLE CONSIDERATION. OKAY OFTEN KEVIN AS THE CHORUS OF CALIFORNIA BOTH RIGHTS ORGANIZATION. THIS CAME TO ATTENTION SEVERAL YEARS AGO WHEN THE DEPARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICES REVEALED THAT THREE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED NINETEEN PEOPLE. WERE MILLING MEETING THE FEDERAL STRINGENT BOTH WORK PARTICIPATION RATES WHILE ALSO BEING SANCTIONED PUT DURING THAT. SECTION MEANS THAT FOR FAMILY OF TO YOUR BENEFITS GOES DOWN FOR FIVE SIXTY A MONTH THAT TO PAY FIFTY FIVE A MONTH. MEANWHILE MANY OF THEM ARE WORKING OF MEETING THE FEDERAL WORK PARTICIPATION RATES IN ORDER FOR THAT TO CURE THE SANCTION. AND FOR EXAMPLE IF THERE WAS SECTION BECAUSE THEY CAN GO TO CHOP CLUB. WHEN THEY WERE ASKED TO GO THERE THERE WERE. YOUR TO TO THE SECTION THEY HAVE SUPPORTER CHAPTER FOR THREE WEEKS. WELL YEAH. WE HAVE A CHOICE YOU GO TO WORK LEGAL JOB CLUB WHICH WOULD WHY DO YOU CONTINUE TO WORK. SO THEY SHOULD NOT BE SANCTIONED THIS BILL WOULD BASICALLY SAY INFINITE WP A FEDERAL WPR. NO SANCTIONS WE GOING TO COMMUTE CHILDCARE AND TRANSPORTATION. THANK YOU FOR VERY MUCH FOR DOING THE RIGHT THING. LARGE DRIVE BOTH THANK YOU STOP. MADAM CHAIR MICRO WITH WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY WE CONCUR IN THE COMMENTS ON THE STRADDLING ME AND YET THIS SEEMS LIKE A VERY COMMON SENSE MEASURE TO US -- IF SOMEONE IS MEETING THE WORK QUORUM IT'S IS WHAT CAN WE SHOULDN'T BE SANCTIONED. AND IT ALSO SEEMS SOMEWHAT FOOLISH TO US THAT WE WOULD BE REQUIRING COUNTY WORKERS TO BE PURSUING THESE KIND OF CASES WHEN THERE ARE SO MANY MORE IMPORTANT THINGS THAT CAN BE DONE TO HELP LIFT UP OTHER FAMILIES. SO WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS BILL AND URGENT AYE VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. I THINK BETH WITH THE COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTORS THE SPORT.

AND UNLESS THERE'S ANY OPPOSITION [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] ARE THERE YOU PRIME DOING. I WILL JOIN YOU ON THIS ONE HAVE THAT. AS A JOINT AUTHORED AT THIS BILL I WOULD LIKE -- TO TALK ABOUT -- SB WHAT NINE EIGHTEEN WHEN WE LOOK AT THE ROOT CAUSES FOR WHY YOUTH ARM TO HOMELESS WE COME TO FIND THAT THEY ARE DRASTICALLY DIFFERENT FROM THE REASONS WHY. ADULTS FIND THEMSELVES IN THE STREETS THESE YOUNG ADULTS -- THESE YOUNG ADULTS A LEFT TO FEND ARE LEFT TO FEND FOR THEMSELVES OFF THE FACE BARRIERS GETTING AN EDUCATION OR SECURING A JOB AND ARE IN HIGH RISK OF BECOMING VICTIMS OF PHYSICAL AND SEXUAL ASSAULT. THAT'S BECAUSE WITHOUT SAYING THAT HOMELESSNESS CAN HAVE LONG LASTING EFFECTS ON A YOUNG PERSON'S. CHANCES OF SUCCESS THAT IS WHY WE CAN AND MUST DO MORE FOR THESE YOUNG FOLKS -- NO CHILD SHOULD BE FORCED TO SPEND A SINGLE NIGHT ON THE STREETS AND IT IS UNACCEPTABLE THAT ONE IN TEN OF CALIFORNIA'S USED -- ARE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS RIGHT NOW AND I I PRESENTED ON THIS CASE BEFORE ON THIS ISSUE BEFORE WE HAVE AS OF TODAY WE HAVE FIFTEEN THOUSAND KIDS THAT DON'T HAVE A PLACE TO TO TO LIVE -- IT IS VERY HOT TODAY -- BUT WHEN WE ORIGINALLY STARTED THE PROCESS OF THE SPELL I REMEMBER THAT DAY WAS A EXTREMELY EXTREMELY COLD AND RAINY. AND SO I WE ALL WERE RUNNING HOME AND TRYING -- TO MAKE SURE THAT -- WE GOT OUT OF THE RAIN AND UNFORTUNATELY FOR THEY DON'T HAVE. SO -- INQUIRED -- ALONG WITH I SENATOR WIENER AYE WE RESPECTFULLY ASK OF FOR YOUR AYE VOTE AND WE HAVE -- HIS OFTEN YEAH OF THE PRESENTERS THANK YOU.

AND HELLO THANK YOU -- MY NAME IS PATRICK CHEN GOT IT AND IN -- FEBRUARY OF TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN I WAS JUST FINISHING UP MY SENIOR YEAR OF HIGH SCHOOL WAS MY LAST HALF OF THAT SENIOR YEAR. WHEN I RECENTLY TURNED EIGHTEEN AND I WAS KICKED OUT OF MY HOUSE IT WASN'T FOR ANY DRUGS ANY MISBEHAVIOR AT SATURDAY? IT WAS BECAUSE I WAS HAVING SOME MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES AND MY FAMILY WAS NOT RECEPTIVE TO IT. I LIKE MANY -- KIDS WHO ENDED UP ON THE STREET HAD A LONG HISTORY OF ENTERING A PIECE FROM FAMILY AND HAD GROWN UP POOR AND IMPOVERISHED. I DIDN'T REALLY HAVE ALL TOO MANY TOOLS NAM BUT ONE THING I DID HAVE WAS I HAD CONNECTIONS AT MY SCHOOL AND I WAS GOOD AT RESEARCH. SO I JUST SO HAPPEN TO BE ABLE TO BE HELPED BY TOM WINDY YOUTH SERVICES THEY ARE THE ONLY A DROP IN AND EMERGENCY -- YOUTH SHELTERS IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY -- AND I CAN QUITE AUTHORITATIVELY SAY THAT THEY SAVED MY LIFE. THEY ONLY HAD SIX BEDS AT THE TIME. OUT OF THE HUNDREDS ALMOST PROBABLY THOUSANDS OF KIDS IN OUR COUNTY WHO WERE SLEEPING ON THE STREETS ARE BOUNCING BETWEEN FRIENDS HOUSES LIKE I WAS BEFORE THE THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE SAME LUCK I DID TO BE ABLE TO GET ONE OF THOSE SIX BATS [inaudible] AND WHEN YOU SERVICES WASN'T JUST A ROOF OVER MY HEAD. THEY WERE ALSO CARRYING IN SUPPORT OF STAFF -- THEY WERE VERY. WONDERFUL TO ME THEY HELPED ME TO LEARN HOW TO BUDGET THEY HELPED ME TO LEARN HOW TO TAKE CARE OF MYSELF -- TO HELP ME GET TO AND FROM THERAPY THEY HELP ME GET TO AND FROM THE HIGH SCHOOL I GRADUATED I ACTUALLY GRADUATED I'M I THOUGHT FEW HONORS AWARDS AND I WAS A STRAIGHT A STUDENT AND I WAS ABLE TO MAINTAIN THIS BECAUSE I HAD HELP FROM WHEN DO YOU. AND FOR THE SIX MONTHS I WAS THERE I SAW IN IN OUT KIDS COMING IN AND AND THEY WERE CHEST MOST OF THEM WERE EITHER IN FOSTER CARE. ON THEY WERE CAME FROM IMPOVERISHED BACKGROUNDS THEY WERE ABUSED. IT WAS JUST THERE WERE JUST SO MANY OF THESE KIDS THEY HAD SUCH DISTRUST TOWARDS ADULTS THEY'D BEEN THROUGH SO MUCH AND THEY DESPERATELY NEEDED THIS HOW. SOME OF THEM EVEN LIKE HAD A HARD TIME BEING RECEPTIVE TO THE HELP WHICH WAS SO WELL CURATED BY WHEN THE AND IT BREAKS MY HEART TO THINK THAT. OF ALL OF THE HOMELESS YOUTH LIKE A IN OUR STATE VERY FEW OF THEM HAD ACCESS TO THE HELP WHICH IS THE REASON WHY I AM CURRENTLY -- STARTING MY SECOND YEAR OF COLLEGE I AM A JOURNALISM MAJOR AT SACRAMENTO CITY COLLEGE ON I HAVE MY OWN APARTMENTS AND I LIVING WOODLAND AND AYE I RECENTLY. I'VE BEEN SPEAKING ON COUNCILS OF MICE LOCAL CITY COUNCIL FOR THINGS I'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO SO MUCH. AND I WOULD NOT BE HERE I WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO DO ANYTHING ANY OF THIS I MOST LIKELY WOULDN'T BE HERE ON THIS EARTH IF IT WEREN'T FOR WIND YOU'VE SERVICES HELP AND THIS BILL. WOULD HELP FUND THEA THING SIMILAR TO WINGS YOUTH ALL ACROSS [inaudible] THE STATE [inaudible] SO. THE HELP I RECEIVED THIS LIFESAVING HELP AND SUPPORT WHICH I RECEIVED TO BE ABLE TO BECOME A FUNCTIONING ADULT. WON'T JUST BE BECAUSE I WAS LUCKIER I HAD THE RIGHT CONNECTIONS. IT'LL BE AVAILABLE TO JUST ABOUT ANY. STRUGGLING COUGH -- KID WHO IS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS AND I I HOPE THAT YOU WILL VOTE AYE FOR THIS. UP PROPOSAL IT WOULD MEAN SO MUCH NOT ONLY TO ME BUT TO JUST. HOW MANY KIDS OUT THERE WHO DON'T EVEN HAVE AN IDEA THAT THIS COULD BE POTENTIALLY SAVING THEIR LIFE AND A YEAR OR SO THANK YOU? THANK YOU. NEXT CAMERAS THAT WITH THE CALIFORNIA COALITION PREET WHEN THE PART BECAUSE SPONSORS ON THE BELL AND WHEN THEY THINK THE CO AUTHOR OF A BOOK AUTHORED CHAIR AND SENATOR WIENER AS WELL THAT THE CO AUTHORS ON THIS COMMITTEE. FOR I'M SUPPORTING THE SPELL AND AND DOING MORE FOR NOW WE HAVE THE LAST STATEWIDE SURVEY NOW THAT ONLY TWENTY AT THE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES AT SERVICES OF ANY KIND LIKE -- PATRICK WAS TALKING HERE ABOUT AND SUPPORT OF OUR YOUTH EXPERIENCINGHOMELESSNESS AND WE KNOW THAT THERE'S OVER A PRESENTATION OF YOUTH OF COLOR AND LGBT YOUTH WHO ARE ON THE STREETS AND WE CAN AND SHOULD DO MORE TO REALLY COMBAT THE ISSUE OF CHRONIC HOMELESSNESS. BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT 50% THE CHRONICALLY HOMELESS ADULTS. FIRST EXPERIENCE HOMELESSNESS WHEN THEY WERE YOUTH. BETWEEN THE AGES OF EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY FOUR AND SO ON I THINK IF YOUR TIME ATTENTION TO THIS ISSUE AND HOPE THAT CALIFORNIA CAN REALLY. SET A PRESIDENT ONLY POLICY TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES BE THE EXPERIENCE OF HOMELESSNESS THINK IS A MUCH. THANK YOU AND YET THOUGH. FOR SUPPORT WITNESSES.

COMING UP ABA MISTER WEINER HAS A SECOND OF THANK YOU GO HAVE EXCELLENT I THINK YOU TURN MEMBERS FOR WELCOMING -- ME ON BEHALF OF SENATOR WIENER TO PRESENT SB -- SEVEN TWENTY SIX SB SEVEN TWENTY SIX MODERNIZES OUTDATED LANGUAGE THAT RESULTS IN REALLY QUESTIONABLE DEBT COLLECTION PRACTICES FROM CAL WORKS AND ADDITIONALLY -- IN CASES WHERE CHILD SUPPORT CURRENTLY AS GARNISH TO REPAY CAO WORKS THAT -- THE FORMER COWARDS CHILDREN HOW THEIR INCOME SEIZE TO REPAY THEIR PARENTS OR GUARDIANS DEBT SO SB SEVEN TWENTY SIX TACKLES THESE TWO PROBLEMS ON FIRST BY CLARIFYING THE COUNTY PROGRAM ADMINISTRATORS CAN MAKE A DECISION TO ADMINISTRATIVELY WAIVER EXPUNGE CAO WORKS OVER PAYMENTS. IF IT'S ADMINISTRATIVELY EFFICIENT TO DO SO SIMILAR TO THE WAY WE HANDLE CAO FRESH OVERPAYMENTS -- ADDITIONALLY MODERNIZES THE DEBT COLLECTION THRESHOLD FROM THIRTY FIVE DOLLARS TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS SO THAT COUNTY STOP LOSING MORE MONEY. TRYING TO TIME COLLECT THAT I'M MORE MONEY THAN THEY'RE RECEIVING. ADDITIONALLY -- THE LASTLY THIS ENSURES THAT ONLY THE INDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBLE FOR A CAL WORKS OVER PAYMENT HASTA REPEAT THAT DEBT. WHICH WILL PROTECT CHILDREN FROM BEING. FOR BY PROTECTING CHILD SUPPORT FROM THIS PRACTICE ON THIS IS A COMMONSENSE SPELL THAT WILL MAKE ISSUING PUBLIC BENEFITS BOTH MORE FAIR TO THE RECIPIENTS AS WELL AS MORE COST EFFECTIVE. AND COLLECT POTENTIALLY VULNERABLE CHILDREN OR YOUNG ADULTS -- FOR THE THAT. LACK OF PAYMENT YOU KNOW ON BEHALF OF THEIR PARENTS -- THANK YOU TO THE SPONSORS OF THE SPELL OF THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY FOR THEIR ADVOCACY ON THIS ISSUE AS WELL AS TESTIFYING TODAY. ARMS OF SPEAKING WITH ME IS MY CARROLLTON THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY AS WELL AS KEVIN FUNNY AND FROM THE COALITION FOR CALIFORNIA WELFARE RIGHTS ORGANIZATION YES AND BEFORE WE CONTINUE I JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY THAT -- MISDEMEANORS ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENT YES THERE'S A SMALL TECHNICAL AMENDMENT THAT HE IS ACCEPTING THANK YOU THINK YOUR PSYCHOPATHIC -- MADAM CHAIR MICHAEL WITH THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY I I THINK OUR SUBSTITUTE AUTHOR HERE DIDN'T EXCELLENT JOB OF OUTLINING THE PROVISIONS OF THE BILL -- ONE THING THAT WE WOULD JUST LIKE TO BRING TO THE COMMITTEE'S ATTENTION ANY ONE OF THE REASONS THAT THIS HAPPENED THIS THERE ARE PROVISIONS IN THIS BILL. ABOUT THE RECRUITMENT OF OVERPAYMENTS FROM CHILDREN -- WE ACTUALLY HAD A CASE LIKE THIS WE HAVE SEEN MANY CASES LIKE THIS OVER TIME WHERE CHILDREN HAVE BEEN HAD. AN OVERPAYMENT PURSUED INTO THEIR ADULTHOOD WHEN THEY BECAME A POWER IN IT BECAME PART OF THEIR OWN COWARDS FAMILY IN THE FUTURE. ON CHASING DOWN IN ADULTS CIRCA. AND WE WERE KIND OF FRANKLY SHOCKED THAT THIS WAS HAPPENING WITH THE CAL WORKS PROGRAM SO -- FORTUNATELY THE COURTS AGREED WITH US AND MR WIENER NOW AGREES WITH US AND WE'RE HOPING THAT THIS BILL WILLTHEN BECOME THE LAW AND THAT THAT WOULD NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN TO ANOTHER CHILD ON CAL WORKS. SO WE'RE URGING AND I VOTE FOR THIS TODAY THANK YOU THANK YOU. SO KEVIN I THINK CHORUS A CALIFORNIA BOB RIGHTS ORGANIZATION WE HAD A SIMILAR CASE WERE. ON THE BELT TWENTY FIVE YEARS OLD HAD THEIR OWN INCOME TAX RETURN WITHHELD. WHICH I FORGOT Y. BOOK. TEN YEARS AGO DIFFERENT TACK OVERPAYMENT. SO NOW THEY TOOK THE INCOME TAX RETURN THAT'S KIND OF WHAT THE COMMENCEMENT. BENEFIT IN THE AT THE TIME THE CHILD WAS BUT A FIFTEEN OR TEN YEARS OLD WHATEVER. AND THE OTHER THING THAT THAT THIS BILL DOES MAKE SURE THAT. WE DON'T SPEND A HUNDRED DOLLARS TO COLLECT TWENTY DOLLARS. EFFECTIVE BUTTE COUNTY THIS SPENT MORE MONEY ON COLLECTION THAT AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT THEY COLLECT. AND THAT'S BAD. THE MADE THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD NOT OPERATE THAT WAY. SO THEREFORE WITH SUPPORT THE BILL NURTURED AYE VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON DANIEL CANDLE BECAUSE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA TAX REFORM ASSOCIATION IN STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU. I SHOULD NOTE THAT THE LACK OF COMING UP WITH BECAUSE THE TWO COMMITTEES HAPPENING IN THE SAME TIME YEAH. THANK YOU -- ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. OKAY HOPING IT UP TO THE GUYS FOR ANY QUESTIONS FROM OUR COMMITTEE [inaudible] GET. HEARING NONE I HAVE OF MOTION THE SECOND CAN CALL THE ROLL PLEASE. RUBIO AYE REVEAL AYE DOCTOR CHOI. DOCTOR CHOI AYE I'M GONNA MAIENSCHEIN [inaudible] THERE'S STONE. STONE AYE THURMOND. THURMOND AYE BILL WAS UP PORTANTINO THE BILLET OUT FOR UP FOUR ZERO WILL LEAVE THE POLL OPEN FOR OTHER MEMBERS TO ADD ON THANK YOU AND I AS SENATOR SKINNER'S NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO A JOIN US I WILL BE. PRESENTING ON HER BEHALF OKAY SENATOR SKINNER GO AHEAD. AND I'M GOING TO HER COMMITTEE SIZE AIP APPROVE WHATEVER I'M OF PRESENTING TO EARLIER -- ALRIGHT LET'S SEE SO I WILL GO AHEAD AND START -- THEY'VE TAKEN TECHNICAL MINUTES WHICH HAVE REMOVED THE OPPOSITION CAL WORKS AND CAL FRESH ESSENTIAL ESSENTIAL IN KEEPING FAMILIES AND FED INC BOARD -- THEY WORK A MINIMUM OF TWENTY TO THIRTY HOURS PER WEEK -- THAT SEE THE PURPOSE OF THE BILL. IS TO PROTECT PARTICIPANTS FROM LOSING THEIR BENEFITS AND WHEN LEAVING AN UNSAFE AND VOLATILE WORKPLACE TO IT INSURANCE COUNTING HUMAN SERVICES THAT NAME FROM INFORMS PARTICIPANTS. ARE THEIR RIGHTS AND REMEDIES WHEN THE WORKPLACE VIOLATIONS OCCUR [inaudible] AND HERE. IF YOU CAN HELP ME OUT HERE BECAUSE SIX PURPOSES THING YES -- RECALL YOU MADAM CHAIR NOVI YOUR IT'S A PUBLIC RECORD -- THANK YOU MICHAEL WITH THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY -- AND SO -- WE VIEW THIS BILL WITH AN ESSENTIAL PROTECTION OF CAO WORKS RECIPIENTS WHO ARE REQUIRED BY LAW FEDERAL ESTATE LAW TO HAVE TO WORK. IN ORDER TO RECEIVE THEIR CASTE SYSTEM. BUT THERE ARE SOME CIRCUMSTANCES THAT THAT ARE CAL WORKS RECIPIENTS GET INTO. WHICH I'M REALLY KIND OF A BRIDGE THERE THEIR EMPLOYMENT RIGHTS IN THEIR COUPLE THINGS ALL AT MISTRANSLATED AND SPEAK TO THIS ALSO. BUT I THINK THERE ARE TWO SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WE REALLY WORRY ABOUT ONE IS THE UNPREDICTABILITY OF SCHEDULED HOURS. SO WE FREQUENTLY SEE -- SOMEONE WHO THE COUNTY WILL SAY THEY'RE GONNA GET TWENTY HOURS A WEEK AT THE FOR THE TARGET STORE WELL GUESS WHAT THEY ONLY GET SCHEDULED FOR TWELVE HOURS A WEEK THREE WEEKS IN A ROW AT THE TARGET STORE. THEY CAN'T CONTROL THE SCHEDULING OF THE TARGET MANAGER DOES -- THAT CAN LEAD TO A SANCTIONED SO I THINK SOMEONE WITH UNPREDICTABLE SCHEDULING OUGHT TO BE PROTECTED FROM A SANCTION AND IF THEY HAVE TO LEAVE THAT JOB. BY BEING ABLE TO COME TO THE WELFARE OFFICE AND AND AND TELL THE WORKER LOOK I HAVE TO QUIT THIS JOB I HAVE TO BE ABLE. TO NOT BE SANCTIONED BECAUSE MY HOURS ADJUST TO UNPREDICTABLE AND THEN I THINK THE OTHER THING THAT WE SEE ARE THERE ARE. UNFORTUNATELY SOME UNSCRUPULOUS EMPLOYERS WHO TEND NOT TO I AM ENFORCE ALL THE LAWS THAT. EVERYTHING FROM THE MINIMUM WAGE TO WORKERS COMPENSATION TO HEALTH AND SAFETY VIOLATIONS ALL OF THESE ARE THINGS THAT WHEN THEY ARE VIOLATED COME MOST WORKERS -- WOULD HAVE A GRIEVANCE WILL BE ABLE -- TO CHALLENGE THAT BEHAVIOR -- BUT IF IT HAPPENS OFTEN TO ACCOUNTS RECIPIENT BECAUSE THEY FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE TO MEET THEIR HOURS THEY DON'T CHALLENGE THAT BEHAVIOR THEY ARE NOT ABLE. TO DO IT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THEIR WORKERS' RIGHTS THAT ALL OF US OTHERWISE ENJOY SO THIS BILL WOULD GIVE THEM. CLEAR ABILITY TO DO THAT AND TO BE PREVENTED FROM BEING HAVING A SANCTION IMPOSED BY THE COUNTY DUE TO SOME BEHAVIOR OF AN UNSCRUPULOUS EMPLOYER WE ARE CHEN IVA. THAT KEVIN NOTHING CLARISSA CALIFORNIA WELFARE RIGHTS ORGANIZATION THE PRIMARY PURPOSE OF THIS BILL [inaudible] TO PROVIDE SAME WORKER PROTECTION PROTECTIONS THAT REGULAR WORKERS HAVE THAT WELFARE RECIPIENTS WILL ALSO HAVE WHEN THEY ARE REQUIRED TO WORK IN THEIR TO WORK OFF THEIR WELFARE CHECK. THE MEN OF WHAT THEY DO THAT PICKED A WELFARE CHECK THE DIVIDE IT BY THE MINIMUM WAGE IN THIS EVERY MONTH YOU HAVE TO WORK THESE MANY HOURS. THAT'S FINE WE'RE WORK BUT JUST GIVE US THE SAME. THE RIGHTS THAT OTHER WORKERS HAVE -- AND IF THE SANCTION BASICALLY IF THEY GET SANCTIONED IN THEIR BENEFITS GO THAT PROVIDES FIVE THINK THAT MONTH. THAT THREE FIFTY FIVE A MONTH BENEATH AND THE HOMELESS AND THAT'S BAD TO SO WE ARE TONIGHT VOTE THANK YOU. OKAY S.
