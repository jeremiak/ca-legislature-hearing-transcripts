00:49:09.913 --> 00:49:10.447

AM. THAT I DO HAVE CONCERNS

00:49:15.452 --> 00:49:17.287
WANT TO NOTICES THE AUTHOR.

00:49:17.354 --> 00:49:20.090
TOOK AMENDMENTS TO MAKE IT VERY

00:49:20.157 --> 00:49:22.592
CLEAR THAT NO IN ACTIVE- NO

00:49:22.659 --> 00:49:24.161
INACTIVE VOTER WOULD RECEIVE A

00:49:24.227 --> 00:49:26.063
MAIL BALLOT WHICH I THINK IS AN

00:49:26.129 --> 00:49:27.698
IMPORTANT PROTECTION. HAD IT

00:49:27.764 --> 00:49:30.067
IS. IT IS PART OF CURRENT LAW

00:49:30.133 --> 00:49:31.335
BUT THAT NEEDS TO BE THAT

00:49:31.401 --> 00:49:34.338
NEEDED TO BE CLARIFIED. ANOTHER

00:49:34.404 --> 00:49:35.539
THING THAT'S IN HERE THAT THE

00:49:35.605 --> 00:49:36.506
ACTUALLY WASN'T IN THE

00:49:36.573 --> 00:49:37.908
GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER BUT

00:49:37.974 --> 00:49:39.743
I THINK IS IMPORTANT IS. IS

00:49:39.810 --> 00:49:41.812
THAT IT ALLOWS FOR COUNTIES TO

00:49:41.878 --> 00:49:43.647
USE THEIR OWN TRACKING SYSTEM.

00:49:43.714 --> 00:49:45.215
THAT THEY ARE NOT FORCED TO USE

00:49:45.282 --> 00:49:46.450
ONLY THE SECRETARY OF STATE'S

00:49:46.516 --> 00:49:48.752
TRACKING SYSTEM. NOW THAT'S

00:49:48.819 --> 00:49:50.721
COMES FROM INPUT. THAT WE

00:49:50.787 --> 00:49:53.123
RECEIVED. FROM COUNTY ELECTIONS

00:49:53.190 --> 00:49:54.925
OFFICIALS AND GOES TO ANOTHER

00:49:54.991 --> 00:49:56.393
POINT OF WHY IT'S IMPORTANT AT

00:49:56.460 --> 00:49:58.795
THE LEGISLATURE. DOES THIS

00:49:58.862 --> 00:50:00.864
WORK. WHY IT'S IMPORTANT THAT.

00:50:00.931 --> 00:50:02.332
THESE THINGS ARE NOT DONE BY AN

00:50:02.399 --> 00:50:05.235
EXECUTIVE ORDER CHANGING

00:50:05.302 --> 00:50:07.938
ELECTIONS CODES AND STATUTES-

00:50:08.004 --> 00:50:09.506
UNILATERALLY BUT RATHER THE

00:50:09.573 --> 00:50:11.375
LEGISLATURE IS THE ONE THAT

00:50:11.441 --> 00:50:13.744
NEEDS TO DO THIS WORK. AND I

00:50:13.810 --> 00:50:15.379
THINK THIS PROCESS THE SHOW NOT

00:50:15.445 --> 00:50:17.681
ONLY THAT- WELL IT IS THE DUTY

00:50:17.748 --> 00:50:19.950
FREE FIRST AND FOREMOST AND IT

00:50:20.016 --> 00:50:22.052
IS OUR LEGISLATIVE POWERS-

00:50:22.119 --> 00:50:23.620
CONSIST WITH OUR LEGISLATIVE

00:50:23.687 --> 00:50:26.790
POWERS TO DO THIS- BUT IT SHOWS

00:50:26.857 --> 00:50:28.959
THAT WE CAN ACT. QUICKLY OUT

00:50:29.025 --> 00:50:30.527
THIS IS BEING PASSED ON URGENCY

00:50:30.594 --> 00:50:31.995
BECAUSE AND WE ARE BEING ABLE

00:50:32.062 --> 00:50:33.463
TO DO THIS AND GIVE DIRECTION

00:50:33.530 --> 00:50:35.232
TO OUR ELECTIONS OFFICIALS. ON

00:50:35.298 --> 00:50:37.634
HOW WE CAN CONDUCT. AN ELECTION

00:50:37.701 --> 00:50:40.771
SAFELY- BUT ALSO PROTECT THE

00:50:40.837 --> 00:50:42.739
INTEGRITY. OF THAT ELECTION A

00:50:42.806 --> 00:50:45.642
LONG TERM ONE MORE THING I WANT

00:50:45.709 --> 00:50:47.110
TO POINT OUT IS THAT IS.

00:50:47.177 --> 00:50:48.412
ANOTHER THING THIS BILL DOES IS

00:50:48.478 --> 00:50:51.014
ENSURE THAT. BALLOTS THAT ARE

00:50:51.081 --> 00:50:52.682
COMING IN AFTER THE ELECTION DO

00:50:52.749 --> 00:50:54.418
GO THROUGH A VETTING PROCESS TO

00:50:54.484 --> 00:50:56.319
ENSURE THAT THEY WERE. IN FACT

00:50:56.386 --> 00:50:59.289
CAST. HONOR BEFORE ELECTION DAY

00:50:59.356 --> 00:51:00.824
THAT'S AN IMPORTANT PROTECTION.

00:51:00.891 --> 00:51:02.826
OTHERS PUT INTO THIS BILL. AND

00:51:02.893 --> 00:51:05.128
SO WITH ALL THESE THINGS AGAIN

00:51:05.195 --> 00:51:07.164
IT SHOWS THAT. YES INDEED THE

00:51:07.230 --> 00:51:10.233
LEGISLATURE DOES WORK- AND THAT

00:51:10.300 --> 00:51:14.871
WE CAN. AND TODAY WILL- ACT. TO

00:51:14.938 --> 00:51:17.140
ENSURE SAFE AND FAIR ELECTIONS
