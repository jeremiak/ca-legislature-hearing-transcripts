OTHER THAN TO GO TO COURT AND THIS WOULD CREATE A VEHICLE TOW STORAGE BOARD THAT WE RESOLVE DISPUTES BETWEEN TELL COMPANIES AND THE VEHICLE OWNERS AND THAT'S WHAT WE HOPE TO DO THIS BILL AND I RESPECTFULLY WOULD ASK WHEN I'VE OPEN THIS COMMITTEE- CONVENES. I THANK YOU MR SANTIAGO- DO YOU HAVE ANY- WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ASSEMBLY MADE IT WE DO HAVE TWO WITNESSES IN SUPPORT- YES I'M INTEROPERABLE WOULD YOU PLEASE OPEN THE LINES FOR.

GOOD AFTERNOON BY CHEN MEMBERS THIS IS KIRK BLACK ARAMBULA DEVOTED ADVOCATE CALLING ON BEHALF THE COMPANY TOOK A CONCLUSION A SPONSOR OF EIGHTY TO NINETY FOUR- INITIAL DEPLOYMENT THANK ASSEMBLYMEMBER SANTIAGO FOR OFFERING THAT SUPPORT BILL AS WELL AS CHAIR pSTAFFER. FOR PROVIDING. US WITH EXCELLENT FEEDBACK ANALYSIS. I THINK IT IS SEVEN UP SPONSOR DUE TO NON FOUR AND ORDER TO DRIVE LEARNED OVERSIGHT CALIFORNIA THE LAST OF A STATE WIDE AND- LEGO. THE TOWING INDUSTRY. WELL THERE ARE A NUMBER OF CONSUMER PROTECTION PROVIDE UNDER CURRENT LAW THERE'S A LACK OF ENFORCEMENT TO PREVENT BAD ACTORS WITH INDUSTRY FROM CIRCUMVENTING THE FOUGHT. FURTHER VEHICLE OWNERS ARE OFTENTIMES WHAT CONFUSED AND WITHOUT ANY RECOURSE THAT THEY BELIEVE THEY. WERE OVERCHARGED WHEN THE VEHICLE WAS TOWED. AB TWO NINETY FOUR RECTIFY OVERSIGHT BY NINETY AND NINE. BOARD UNDER. REPAIRS NAME THE VEHICLE TOW AND STORAGE BOARD. EVERY BUSINESS THAT OPERATES A TOW TRUCK OR CHARGES FOR THE STORAGE OF THE TOKYO CLINT IN CALIFORNIA WOULD NEED TO APPLY FOR A VEHICLE TOWING STORAGE PERMIT FROM THE BOARD. AND THE BOARD WOULD HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO SUSPEND THIS PAYMENT COMPARED VIOLATIONS OF LAW. AS A CONDITION OF OBTAINING THE PERMIT BUSINESSES WE NEED TO LISTEN AND A HOST OF INFORMATION ABOARD COULDN'T COME COMPANY CONTACT INFORMATION. AND AUTHORIZED TOWING STORAGE RANGE ALL OF WHICH WILL BE POSTED ON THE BOARD'S WEBSITE SO CONSUMERS CAN EASILY ACCESS. AND USE OF INFORMATION. FURTHER IN ORDER TO. OVER BILL IN THE AND I A PRETTY QUICK. FOR DISPUTE RESOLUTION UP ON THE BOARD WHERE BANKS. HIS COVER ANYTHING OR ANY TIME. THIS PROCESS WE THAT TEETERS LOS REQUIRE COMPANIES TO BUY BUT IT PROVED A POTENT GREAT. WEALTH WHICH WAS AN APARTMENT AND LEFT ABILITY TO TAP INTO LEGALLY TELL DISCORDANT STATE. OVERALL WE BELIEVE THIS BILL IS A CRITICAL STEP TOWARD CURBING THE- OF POWER. BY THE TELLING THE STORY AND JUST. THANK YOU. BEFORE WE PROCEED TO THE NEXT ONE AS WELL ESTABLISHED QUORUM. AMEND SECTOR WE PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. THE FARM CARE. BERMAN CUNNINGHAM DALY HERE DAVIES HERE DAYS HERE GIPSON. KALRA YOUR COMPANY HERE WE HEAR WE HERE MEDINA. NAZARIAN PRESIDENT WHEN O'DONNELL. DONALD WARD. WICKS HERE. WE HAVE A QUORUM MISTER CHECK IF ANOTHER WE REQUIRE MAKE A MOTION TO MOVE YES MOTIONS ARE SECOND. HELLO MOTION A SECOND I'M GOING TO THE NEXT- WITH US IN SUPPORT OF PERSONAL INSURANCE FEDERATION OF CALIFORNIA. YOU MAY PROCEED. THANK YOU THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS I'M SORRY TAYLOR HERE ON BEHALF OF THE PERSONAL INSURANCE FEDERATION CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT OF AB TWO NINETY FOUR WHICH IS THE LATEST ON A DECADES LONG EFFORT BY THE LEGISLATURE TO BETTER PROTECT CONSUMERS FROM ABUSES AN EXORBITANT CHARGES IN THE TOWING AND AUTO REPAIR INDUSTRIES. NOT SURPRISINGLY THE TELL BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA IS LARGELY UNREGULATED. AND THERE'S NO DATABASE OF TOVIA BECAUSE OPERATING CALIFORNIA. THAT MAKES IT DIFFICULT IDENTIFIED THAT ACTORS. AND TAKE ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS WHEN APPROPRIATE. SO WE WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR ANCHORMEN TO CALIFORNIA TORTURE ASSOCIATION FOR COMING FORWARD WITH A PROPOSAL. TO PUT SOME REGULATORY ACCOUNTABILITY AROUND THE TOWING INDUSTRY TO PROTECT CONSUMERS AND READ OUT THE BAD APPLES. IN ADDITION TO PROVIDING OVERSIGHT FOR TOWERS SO ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT COMPONENTS OF THIS BILL ADDRESSES THE EXCESSIVE STORAGE REACHED CHARGE BY OUR REPAIR DEALERS. WHILE MOST AUTO BODY REPAIR SHOPS ARE RESPONSIBLE. WE'RE STILL SEEING TOO MANY THAT ARE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF CONSUMERS AND CHARGING EXCESSIVE RATES THE COST INSURANCE POLICY HOLDERS HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. AND COMPACT WITH A CYCLE OF POVERTY FOR LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS WHO CANNOT AFFORD TO PAY THE STORAGE BILLS. I'M NOT LOSE THEIR CARS AND SOMETIMES THEIR LIVELIHOOD. NOW THE OPPOSITION ARGUES THAT THE CURRENT SYSTEM IS WORKING FINE TO PROTECT CONSUMERS. BUT OUR RESEARCH INDICATES THAT'S NOT THE CASE. WE STILL FIND IT'S COMMON FOR AUTO REPAIR DEALERS TO CHARGE STORAGE THE VETERAN ACCESS TO TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS A DAY. SOMETIMES IN EXCESS OF A THOUSAND DOLLARS TODAY. AND BY COMPARISON TO STORAGE RATE PAID BY C. H. P. AND I COST CITY LIKE SANFRANCISCO. IS ONLY NINETY THREE DOLLARS PER DAY. SO CURRENTLY THERE'S NO REGULATOR THAT HAS A STORY TO DEFINE REASONABLE STORAGE RATES. OR REQUIRE AN UNSCRUPULOUS BUSINESS TO REPAIR CONSUMER EXCESSIVE CHARGES. AS NOTED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS THE ONLY REMEDY FOR CONSUMERS TO BRING A LAWSUIT AGAINST THE TOWING STORAGE FACILITY FOR DAMAGES. AND THAT'S NOT A PRACTICAL REMEDY FOR MOST PEOPLE. SO INCLUDING EIGHTY TWO NINETY FOUR PROVIDE REGULATORY ACCOUNTABILITY LACKING IN THE TOWING INDUSTRY. AND ESTABLISH A FAIR RESPONSIBLE STORAGE RATE BENCHMARK THAT IS BASED ON REGIONAL RATES NEGOTIATED BY THE CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL. AND WEBER DRIVE OUT THANK YOU. I VERY MUCH- WE WILL NOW MOVE TO WHAT IS OPPOSITION I DON'T BELIEVE WE HAVE ANY LISTED BUT I WILL. GO TO THE PHONES TO SEE IF THERE'S ANYONE FROM THE AUTOMOTIVE SERVICE COUNCIL TO CALIFORNIA. WITH THE CALIFORNIA AUTOBODY ASSOCIATION WITH THE CALIFORNIA AUTOMOTIVE BUSINESS COALITION- IF THEY'RE ON THE LINE TO SPEAK. YES THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON JACK MILLER DONALD ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA AUTOBODY ASSOCIATION THE AUTOMOTIVE SERVICE COUNCIL CALIFORNIA. THE CALIFORNIA AUTOMOTIVE BUSINESS- COALITION WILL CODES UNLESS THE BILL'S AMENDED. THE BILL IS NOT NECESSARY WITH. WITH REGARD TO AUTOMOTIVE REPAIR DEALER'S AUTOMOTIVE REPAIR DEALER'S ON THE BUSINESS OF ABANDONED CARS AND ARE REGULATED. BY THE BUREAU OF AUTOMOTIVE REPAIR THE P. A. ART INCLUDING ANY STORAGE FEES THEY MAY CHARGE. THE TOWING INDUSTRY IS NOT REGULATED BY THE B. R. WE CAN UNDERSTAND. THE INTENTION OF THE BILL THE TOWING INDUSTRY AND AUTO REPAIR INDUSTRY ARE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT BUSINESSES- QUITE COMPARING APPLES WITH ORANGES. THE BA ARE FOCUSED SEIZE APPROXIMATELY SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND. AUTOMOTIVE REPAIR DEALER'S IN THE STATE. THE B. A. R. THE BUREAU OF AUTOMOTIVE REPAIR WE RECEIVED APPROXIMATELY FIFTEEN THOUSAND COMPLAINTS. EACH YEAR OUT OF THE FIFTEEN THOUSAND COMPLAINTS. ONLY SIXTY ARE RELATED TO STORAGE. EVEN THOUGH THE NUMBER IS VERY LOW THE B. R. TREAT STORAGE COMPLAINT SERIOUSLY INVESTIGATE THEY MEDIATE AND HAVE TAKEN DISCIPLINARY ACTION. AGAINST AUTOMOTIVE REPAIR DEALER'S COST RELATED STRATEGIES. EIGHTY FOUR SEVENTY ONE THAT JUST PASSED THIS LAST YEAR AND TOOK EFFECT JANUARY FIRST. STRENGTHENED AND PROVIDE ADDITIONAL AUTHORITY TO THE BA ARE OVER AUTO REPAIR SHOPS WITH REGARDS. IN FACT DURING THE PROCESS PROMULGATING REGULATIONS STORED REGULATION AND HE JUST HELD A WORKSHOP. IN OCTOBER. THE BILL THE NECESSARY IT'S DUPLICATIVE THERE'S NO NEED TO CREATE ANOTHER REGULATORY BOARD TO OVERSEE AUTOMOTIVE REPAIR DEALER'S. WE ARE RESPECTFULLY REQUESTED THE BILL BE AMENDED. GOOD SCHOOL GOOD AUTOMOTIVE REPAIR DEALER'S THAT DON'T HAVE TOW TRUCKS AND INSTEAD. WORK WITH THE BA ARE DOING PROVEN STRENGTH IN THE STORAGE ISSUES THROUGH THE PENDING REGULATORY PROCESS. WE THINK THIS IS A BETTER APPROACH. ALSO THE- PROHIBITS AUTUMN WOULD DEALER CHARGING STATE IN MOSCOW RIGHT. THE CURRENT LAW WHICH WAS A STAB WITH THE STATUS DE WHO REGIONAL WHERE. WAS CREATED YEARS AGO IN A- SO. SANTIAGO BILL A TWO THREE NINETY TWO THANK YOU THE COMPANY THE SPONSORS OF THE BILL NEGOTIATED THE STORE. TWENTY I DON'T THINK IT'S IN TWO MINUTES% SO YOU CAN WRAP UP. THANK YOU THERE'S REALLY NO NEED DISC- DESCRIBE THE STORY'S GREAT DEFINITION- WE THINK THEY OPEN THE WORKING AS INTENDED- WE REQUEST- THAT CURRENT LAW PROVIDING FOR AUTOMOTIVE REPAIR DEALER'S TO CHARGE THEIR REPO RATES NOT BE ELIMINATED THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I THANK YOU- WILL NOW MOVE THE PUBLIC TESTIMONY- I BELIEVE WE HAVE AN INDIVIDUAL HERE IN THE IN THE ROOM SO- ANYONE WHO WANTS TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION. PLEASE COME AND COME FORWARD- TO SICHER OPPOSITION. SIR YOU A PARTICULAR SPEAKER MY NAME IS JOE COLLINS I REPRESENT THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION LICENSE REPOSSESSIONS. I GOT SO MUCH STUFF HERE IT'S GONNA BE QUICK FIRST THE BODY SHOPS ARE CORRECT THEY DON'T HAVE TO- TRUCKS THEY HIRE THE PREDATORY TOWERS WHO TOLD THE CARS TO THE TOW YARD. I'M FELT RECEIVE HERE SIX HUNDRED EIGHTY DOLLARS FOR ONE TELL. THE BODY SHOPS CHARGE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS HOW IT WORKS IS THEY HIRE PEOPLE WHO WAIT IN IN GAS STATIONS AT NIGHT TIME. THEY RESPOND BASED OFF OF A RADIO CALL THE HERE ON THE SCANNER THEY GO PICK UP THE CAR THEY TOLD AWAY AND THAT PERSON THE CONSUMER NEVER SEES THAT CAR AGAIN. NEVER UNLESS SOMEBODY PAYS FOR IT THE PERSON WHO PICKS THE CAR UP DOES NOT WORK FOR THE BODY SHOP HE'S JUST A GUY WITH A TOW TRUCK THAT HIM AND SIX OTHER GUYS HAVE A TOW YARD SOMEWHERE SO YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE THE CARS AT. PUBLIC HEALTH RECEIPT IT HAS NO ADDRESS WHERE THEY LOCATED AND NOBODY ANSWERS THE PHONE THAT'S HOW YOU LOSE YOUR CAR WHEN YOU'RE CONSUMER SO WITH ALL THIS RESPECT TO THE BODY SHOP TO REPAIR FACILITIES THEY HAVE AN ISSUE WITH THAT. THE TOWERS ON THE OTHER HAND BUT TRYING TO MONOPOLIZE THE TOWING INDUSTRY THE WAY THEY'RE DOING THAT IS ENCOMPASSING EVERYBODY INTO A PERMIT- PROCESS. IN WHICH SOMEONE LIKE US THE RE POSSESSORS. WE HAVE TO FOLLOW THE FAIR DEBT COLLECTION PRACTICES THAT THE COLLATERAL COVER YET. THE GRAMM LEACH BLILEY ACT WE HAVE TO HAVE EVERYTHING. OUR EYES DARTED NO TEASE CROSSED. WHAT THEY WANT TO DO IS THEY WANT TO GET A HOLD OF OUR TRUCKS BECAUSE THE PERSON WHO COMPLAINS ABOUT TOW YARD. OR THE REPOSSESSIONS WHEN WE PICK UP THE CARS. I HAVE THE RECEIPTS TO- I HAVE NOT RECEIVED FROM THE PERSON WHO DOES THE TRAINING FOR SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. HE CHARGES A REGULATORY FEE WHICH IS ILLEGAL. THE TOWING. INDUSTRY THE CALIFORNIA TOW TRUCK ASSOCIATION. ONLY WANTS TO REGULATE THE TOWING IN THE STORAGE OF THE VEHICLE THAT'S NOT WHERE THE CONSUMERS ARE CHEATED THEIR CHEATED ON THE ANCILLARY FEES BILLION FEES. ADMIN FEES THE REGULATORY FEES WHICH ARE ALL ILLEGAL. THIS BOARD WOULD NOT HEAR THAT COMPLAINT IF YOU WANT TO COMPLAIN TO THE BOARD YOU HAVE TO PAY FIRST SIR AYE YOU VICTIMIZED BY YOU WANT TO CLARIFY WHAT IS YOUR POSITION ON THIS BILL WE OPPOSE OKAY. SO IMMATURE YOU HAVE TO PAY TO GET YOUR CAR OUT BEFORE YOU CAN COMPLAIN. THAT IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE MONEY BECAUSE THEY'RE CHARGING YOU EXCESSIVE FEES. THEN YOU LOSE YOUR CAR. SO WE OPPOSE THAT WE OPPOSE EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS BILL IS COMPLETELY WRONG THIS IS A WOLF IN SHEEP'S CLOTHING. I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS AND HELLO BLOOD YOUR TIME HAS BEEN ALLOTTED BUT OR DOES RUN OUT BUT A FOR THIS PUBLIC COMMENT THAT HE WOULD SUBMIT YOUR COMMENTS TO THE COMMITTEE WILL.

YES GREAT THURMOND CHAIRMAN AND CHAIRMAN BURKE- FONG- MY NAME IS YOU KNOW AT SOME POINT FROM PLASTER COUNTY AND I'M JUST YOU KNOW CONCERNED ABOUT THIS THIS BILL I FEEL LIKE- YOU MIGHT NEED A LITTLE BIT OF- MAYBE THE PARTIALLY GUIDED AND MAYBE RE LOOKED AT- I AM. I AM FOR FAVOR OF REGULATING- CHARGES FOR THE CONSUMER I DO AGREE WITH THAT. HOWEVER THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER- HEY HE PART OF A VERY VALID POINT ABOUT- THE REGULATORY FEES DEFINITELY SHOULD BE LOOKED AT VERY LONG RANGE SO- I WOULD TO SUPPORT THIS BILL IS IF IT. IS A LANGUAGE HAVE BEEN CHANGED OR OR RE LOOKED AT RETIREMENT. YOUR TIME AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. WELCOME. I MISS ROBERT ANY OTHER INDIVIDUALS ON THE PHONE LINE. NOBODY ELSE IS QUEUED UP THEM ONE ZERO AGAIN IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO EXPRESS SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. MISTER CHAIR NOBODY ELSE'S QUEUING UP. I THINK THIS OPERATOR WE WILL NOW TAKE IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE I BELIEVE ASSEMBLY MEMBER NAZARIAN HAS A QUESTION. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- AND THANK YOU MR SANTIAGO FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD I'VE- OF. I MYSELF HAVE WANTED TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. OUT OF CONCERNS I'VE HEARD FROM MANY CONSTITUENTS ESPECIALLY IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA- FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND YOU HAVE A AGENCIES AND LOS ANGELES TO THE POLICE DEPARTMENTS THAT- CONTRACT WITH- TOW TRUCKS TO TOW TRUCK SERVICE PROVIDING COMPANIES AND THEN YOU HAVE THE PRIVATE SECTOR FOLKS THAT CAN. CONTRACT WITH WHOEVER ELSE THEY WANT AND THEN THERE'S DIRT THERE MIGHT BE OTHER CATEGORIES BUT THERE'S ALSO BEEN KIND OF THE MORE. IT TO CALL IT THIS WAY BUT LOOK FOR LACK OF A BETTER TERM KIND OF THE RENEGADE GROUP OF FOLKS THAT. MAY BE TOW TRUCKS ON HIGHER- IT AND SO FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND THIS BRINGS THAT THIRD GROUP OF COMPANIES. MORE INTO- MOVEMENT BRINGS THEM INTO A SPOTLIGHT TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS A PROCESS AND THERE'S QUESTION AND THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR RECOURSE IF THE SHOULD GO ON TO CHARGE EXORBITANT AMOUNTS AND SO I I'M SUPPORTIVE OF THIS BILL- BUT WOULD LIKE TO SEE IF THERE'S ANY OTHER COMMENTS THAT YOU'D LIKE TO. SHARE FROM. MISTAKEN IN MY UNDERSTANDING NOT I THINK YOU YOU HIT ON THE NAIL THIS IS PART OF THIS IS WHY THE CALIFORNIA TOW TRUCK ASSOCIATION- IS WORKING WITH US ON THIS BILL TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS- THERE'S FAIRNESS. FOR CONSUMERS THAT THERE IS RECOURSE- WHERE THERE ARE SOME- TOE WHICH FEES THAT COULD EXCEED THOUSANDS PREDICT AND WE HEARD VERY EARLY IN IN THE FIRST WITNESS SPEAK ABOUT THE CHP TOWING STORAGES. ARE ABOUT I HOPE I GET THE NUMBER RIGHT FOR MEMORY RIGHT NOW BUT ABOUT NINETY THREE. DOLLARS PER DAY SO THERE'S A DISCREPANCY NOT NOT THOUSAND ISN'T THE AVERAGE FOR SURE- BUT IT'S ONE EXAMPLE OF- EXCEEDINGLY HIGH COST- WE ALSO HEARD EXAMPLES OF ABOUT TWO HUNDRED. NINETY PER DAY BUT BUT THIS BILL TRIES TO DO IS SAY- LET'S SET A STANDARD BUT THERE'S ALSO A PLACE. WHERE CONSUMERS CAN GO TO A- IF THIS BILL SHE GETS SIGN. WHERE IF THERE ARE THOSE- HI COSTS STORAGE AND THEY MAY BE AT HAND WHERE THEY CAN GO. AND FIND RESOLUTION OF IT THE BOARD MAY DECIDE SO THE COMMISSION WE DECIDE- THE CUSTOMER'S NOT RIGHT BUT THEY MAY DECIDE THAT THEY ARE RIGHT IN. YOU COULD YOU HAVE A PLACE TO DISPUTE- IN FIND ACTION IS ACTION IS NECESSARY. COME FROM THE APPRECIATED THANK YOU. OUR WE WILL NOW MOVE TO A MEMBER O'DONNELL. YES SIR THANK YOU MUST CHAIR I JUST WANT TO WEIGH IN ON THIS ISSUE- I THINK I'M GOING TO BE VOTING FOR THIS BUT I'M VERY CAUTIOUS ABOUT THIS BILL VERY CAUTIOUS. I DROVE A TOW TRUCK FOR FIVE YEARS AND I THINK WHAT PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND. IS IT COSTS A LOT OF MONEY TO OPERATE A TOW TRUCK IT COSTS A LOT OF MONEY TO STORE VEHICLES. K. THREE VEHICLES PROBABLY MAKE UP A SMALL IN A STUDIO APARTMENT. THINK WHAT THAT'S GONNA COST JUST YOU KNOW THE SIZE OF THAT THE SPACE OF THAT VERSUS A THE SPACE OF YOUR STORY THREE VEHICLES TAKES A LOT OF MONEY IT CAN'T BE FREE OR WE WILL NOT HAVE TOW TRUCKS ON THE ROAD. SOME PEOPLE WANT TO MAKE IT FREE OKAY SO MY FEAR IS THAT WE MAY BE STACKED THE BOARD WITH FOLKS WHO WANT TO MAKE IT FREE AND WE END UP NO TOW TRUCKS WE END UP WITH NO SERVICE ON THE ROAD. PEOPLE LINE UP IN A BAD SPOT SO I'M A LITTLE CONCERNED ABOUT WHERE THIS IS GOING I'M GOING TO SUPPORT IT TODAY. BUT AGAIN I CANNOT UNDERSCORE ENOUGH THE FACT THAT TOWING OF VEHICLES EXPENSIVE A LIGHT DUTY TOW TRUCK TODAY IS ABOUT A HUNDRED TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS RIGHT FOR ONE. DAY THE INSURANCE ON THAT IS ABOUT TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS THEN YOU HAVE WORKMAN'S COMP. ON TOP OF THAT- VEHICLE INSURANCE ON TOP OF THAT EMPLOYEE COSTS ON TOP OF THAT FUEL TIRES EVERYTHING ELSE THAT GOES ALONG WITH OPERATING A VEHICLE OF THAT SORT AND IT TAKES MONEY. IT pSURE THAT. AS WE MOVE FOR THE REPRESENTATION ON THIS BOARD IS WISE AND THOUGHTFUL TO SMALL BUSINESS. AND THE FACT THAT WE ALSO NEED TO CONTINUE TO HAVE TOW TRUCKS AND VEHICLE STORAGE OUT THERE. AGAIN AND AGAIN. TODOROKI EXPENSIVE STORING VEHICLES AS EXPENSIVE AS WELL BECAUSE YOU AGAIN YOU HAVE TO HAVE EMPLOYEES THAT KIND OF ACCESS TO THE VEHICLE TWENTY FOUR HOUR SHOULD SOMEONE CALL TWO IN THE MORNING WANNA GET THAT VEHICLE THEY HAVE TO BE ABLE TO GET THAT VEHICLE THERE'S INSURANCE ASSOCIATED STORY THAT VEHICLE WELL. THEIR SECURITY ASSOCIATES DURING THAT. SO IT'S NOT CHEAP ON EITHER FRONT. TO OPERATE UNTIL TRUCK OR TO SEE- VEHICLES I JUST HOPE PEOPLE REALLY KEEP THAT IN MIND. AND IF WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THAT SERVICE AVAILABLE WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S NOT GIVING AWAY. WITHOUT IT I CAN VACUUM STRUCTURE. I THANK YOU MISTER O'DONNELL- WE WILL NOW MOVE THIS NUMBER MEDINA. THANK YOU- THANK YOU TO THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THE BILL FORWARD- IT'S AN ISSUE THAT I THINK MANY OF US HAVE DEALT WITH I THINK AS A YOUNG COLLEGE STUDENT- I HAD THAT SAME EXPERIENCE OF HAVING MY CAR BREAK DOWN IN. YOU KNOW WASN'T WORTH A WHOLE LOT OF MONEY. AND SO WHEN I GOT THE BILL FOR STORAGE YOU KNOW I SAID THANK YOU. YOU KNOW YOU COULD KEEP FIVE VW WAS WORTH THAT MUCH. SO WE UNDERSTAND THE ISSUE. BUT I HAVE TWO QUESTIONS THAT I THINK ARE CONCERNS. OF LOCAL- TOW TRUCK- OWNERS. AND THE FIRST ONE IS. AND THE RELATED I BELIEVE THE FIRST ONE IS YOU KNOW DOES THE BILL HAVE ENOUGH TEETH IN THE ENFORCEMENT HE SAID FOR THOSE COMPANIES WHO CONTINUE TO VIOLATE. THERE IS A MECHANISM FOR CONSUMERS TO- ADDRESSES. BUT THE CONCERN THAT I HEARD BACK HOME WAS- WILL BE ENFORCED HOW WILL IT BE ENFORCED DOES IT HAVE ENOUGH T. AND THE SECOND CONCERN. THAT I HEARD BACK HOME IN RIVERSIDE WAS- WILL THESE RESULT IN MORE FEES TO SMALL TOW TRUCK OPERATORS EMPLOYEE COULD ADDRESS IT YEAH I KNOW THE ON THE SECOND ALL STAR BACK IN TERMS OF THIS. THE WAY WE LOOK AT IT WITH A TRY TO CREATE A BALANCED APPROACH TO IT WHICH IS WHY WE PARTNERED WITH THE CALIFORNIA TOW TRUCK ASSOCIATION TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THAT FAIR BALANCE IT SO THEY'RE IN THE ROOM AND THEY'RE WORKING WITH US- IN TERMS OF THE COMMISSION. SORRY THE BOARD TO KEEP CALL COMMISSION AT THE IN THE BOARD WOULD HAVE IN IT TO BALANCED- LAW ENFORCEMENT- THE TOWING INDUSTRY INSURANCE AUTO REPAIR- AND THEN TO MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC SO THAT THE- TOTAL SEVEN PEOPLE WHO WOULD BALANCE IT OUT. AS IT WAS FOR WHAT WHAT IT WHAT IT GIVES THE OPPORTUNITY IS TO BE ABLE TO DISPUTE BEFORE THE BOARD AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THIS PARTICULAR CHARGE- WAS- OUTSIDE THE ORDINARY CHARGE OR JUST TOO HIGH LIKE IN THE CASE OF. MAYOR MAY NOT HAPPEN WITH YOU RIGHT SO IF THE BOARD WOULD THEN HAVE THE ABILITY TO TAKE A LOOK AT THIS COST AND SAY WELL YEAH MAYBE THOUSAND DOLLARS WAS TOO HIGH- FOR THOSE FIVE DAYS EQUALING FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS. SIDE IN THE CASE THAT. TOO HIGH. SO ABILITY TO GO BEFORE AND THIS. MOUNTAIN TO THE PEOPLE THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS RIGHT SO WE COULD STILL GO BACK. TO WE'VE GOT THE WHOLE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS TO TAKE A LOOK AT WHETHER IT IS. IT IS STRONG ENOUGH- CURRENTLY WE TOOK. WE TOOK THE TO MEET THE COMMITTEES AT THE COMMITTEE'S APPROACH- IN TERMS OF. IN TERMS OF TAKE A LOOK AT THIS AND MOVING FOR BUT- I'M OPEN TO TAKING A LOOK AT IT TO SEE IF THEY HAD MORE PEOPLE. WHAT IS REAL IN HERE TO DO WAS TO CREATE. A PLACE. WHERE A YOUNG MISTER MEDINA COULD HAVE GONE AND SAID LOOK THIS IS TOO HIGH. AND THAT THAT BOARD WAS SAID. YOU'RE RIGHT OR YOU'RE WRONG- IN THAT PARTICULAR CASE- MAYBE. IN OTHER SITUATIONS WHERE THAT WOULD HAPPEN MEET MAYBE YOU WOULD HAVE TO GIVE UP THE CAR- I ONLY USE THAT EXAMPLE. YEP THERE ARE SOME EXAMPLES THAT ARE EXTREMELY HIGH. AND ARE THERE SOME THAT MAYBE FARE- THAT MAYBE FAIR TO ADDRESS. THE QUESTION FROM THE PART PREVIOUS COLLEGE- THAT'S WHY WE SET UP IN THAT PARTICULAR. AND THAT'S WHY WE ARE WORKING- WITH THE INDUSTRY AS TO WHAT THAT FAIR NUMBER MIGHT BE. AND THEN THE SECOND QUESTION THIS. IS YOUR SANTIAGO IS- ABOUT THE FEES WITH WITH WITH LOCAL OPERATORS SEE. OF THEIR FEES GO UP- WELL I DON'T KNOW WE'LL SEE THEIR FEES WELL LOOK- HAPPY TO DIG INTO THAT A LITTLE BIT MORE BUT THE WAY WE TOOK A LOOK AT IT WAS- MORE ON THE COST OF THE INDIVIDUAL SO IF WOULD BE- WHAT THAT COST. OF A STORAGE PER DAY WOULD BE. THAT'S WHAT'S REALLY IN DISPUTE. ABOUT BUT HAVE YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THAT WEATHER THAT DOESN'T DOESN'T I DID. I HAPPEN TO SIT ON BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS WHO I THINK IS GOING TO HEAR THIS BILL TOMORROW I BELIEVE- WE ARE WE ARE BUT LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT WHICH LATER THIS WEEK SO- I'M GONNA STAY OFF TODAY AND SEE IF WE CAN. I CAN FIND MORE ANSWERS FOR WHICH IT I THINK. IS THERE ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. A SEEN AS AND AS MENTIONED BEFORE THIS BILL DOES- MOVE FORWARD TO THE NEXT COMMITTEE WHICH IS BUSINESS PROFESSIONS AND- AND- THE I KNOW THERE WILL BE- AND INTENSE REVIEW- FROM THAT COMMITTEE AS WELL AS SOMEBODY DOES SERVE A BUSINESS PROFESSIONS AS WELL- SEEING NO OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS I INVITE THE AUTHOR TO CLOSE I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL CAN APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEE'S INPUT.
