CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION. THIS

00:13:38.651 --> 00:13:40.686
OF COURSE WOULD EXCLUDE SPORTS

TO THE CALIFORNIA INSTITUTION

00:13:52.965 --> 00:13:54.433
IN FACT WOULD BE ANOTHER THIRTY

SECTION NINETEEN EIGHTY OF THE

00:14:03.776 --> 00:14:06.445
CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION DOES

00:14:06.512 --> 00:14:07.012
NOT STAND IN THE WAY OF THIS

00:14:07.079 --> 00:14:10.449
LET'S. AUTHORIZING SPORTS

00:14:10.516 --> 00:14:11.083
BETTING THROUGH A NEW STATUTORY

00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:11.884
REGIME NOW I WANT TO TALK ABOUT

00:14:11.951 --> 00:14:12.418
ONE OTHER CONSTITUTIONAL

00:14:12.484 --> 00:14:14.720
PROVISION- THE ONLY OTHER ONE

00:14:14.787 --> 00:14:16.255
THAT POTENTIALLY STANDS AS A

00:14:16.322 --> 00:14:17.723
BARRIER. TO THE LEGISLATIVE

00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:19.725
AUTHORIZATION OF SPORTS BETTING

00:14:19.792 --> 00:14:21.694
IS SECTION NINETEEN F. OF

00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:23.295
ARTICLE FOR WHICH AUTHORIZES

00:14:23.362 --> 00:14:25.030
THE GOVERNOR OF CALIFORNIA TO

00:14:25.097 --> 00:14:26.565
NEGOTIATE AND CONCLUDE

COMPAQ'S. SUBJECT TO

00:14:28.067 --> 00:14:29.835
RATIFICATION BY THE LEGISLATURE

00:14:29.902 --> 00:14:31.737
THAT WOULD ALLOW CALIFORNIA'S

00:14:31.804 --> 00:14:34.240
INDIAN TRIBES TO OPERATE SLOT

00:14:34.306 --> 00:14:35.774
MACHINES LOTTERY GAMES AND

BANKING IN PERCENTAGE CARD

00:14:37.876 --> 00:14:40.212
GAMES ON TRIBAL LANDS. BUT

00:14:40.279 --> 00:14:41.113
THAT'S JUST A SIMPLE

00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:43.315
AUTHORIZATION MEASURE AND IT

00:14:43.382 --> 00:14:45.718
ONLY APPLIES TO A SPECIFIC SUB

00:14:45.784 --> 00:14:47.586

BANKING AND PERCENTAGE CARD

00:14:52.024 --> 00:14:54.460
GAMES IT DOES NOT PROHIBIT OR

00:14:54.526 --> 00:14:55.160
PREVENT THIS LEGISLATURE FROM

00:14:55.227 --> 00:14:56.762
PASSING A SPORTS BETTING LAW.

00:14:56.829 --> 00:14:57.663
THERE IS SIMPLY NO

00:14:57.730 --> 00:14:59.832
CONSTITUTIONAL IMPEDIMENT TO

00:14:59.898 --> 00:15:01.433
THE LEGISLATIVE AUTHORIZATION

00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:02.468
OF SPORTS BETTING AND I RAISE

00:15:02.534 --> 00:15:04.837
THIS SIMPLY AS A REMINDER THAT

00:15:04.903 --> 00:15:07.306
THE VOTER REFERENDUM PROCESS IS

00:15:07.373 --> 00:15:09.008

00:15:17.249 --> 00:15:19.551
THE BALLOT. AND THEN THE PUBLIC

00:15:19.618 --> 00:15:21.253
HAS TO APPROVE IT. AND IT

00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:22.588
DOESN'T ALWAYS GO THE WAY YOU

00:15:22.655 --> 00:15:25.357

OTHERWISE THE ILLEGAL MARKET

WILL REMAIN NEARLY A STRONG AND

00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:41.954
ROBUST AS IT IS TODAY AND THE

00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:44.156

00:18:44.223 --> 00:18:45.524
FRACTION OF THE POTENTIAL

00:19:02.941 --> 00:19:04.576

00:19:13.752 --> 00:19:14.953
WHAT'S HAPPENING IN NEW YORK

THE MARKET PERFORMANCE AND

00:24:12.184 --> 00:24:14.186

00:24:16.021 --> 00:24:18.123
PERSPECTIVE I'M GOING TO START

00:24:18.190 --> 00:24:19.524
THE DISCUSSION BY TALKING ABOUT

00:24:19.591 --> 00:24:21.226
HOW LEGAL SPORTS BETTING IS

PERFORMING TODAY IN THE U. S.

ITS POTENTIAL IN THE US AND

00:24:25.530 --> 00:24:27.699
CALIFORNIA SPECIFICALLY. OR

00:24:27.766 --> 00:24:28.934
SOME OF THE CORE POLICY LEVERS

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:30.502
DRAMATICALLY IMPACT THE

00:24:30.569 --> 00:24:31.570
PERFORMANCE OF LEGAL SPORTS

00:24:31.636 --> 00:24:33.805
BETTING MARKET PROVIDE A BRIEF

00:24:33.872 --> 00:24:35.373
OVERVIEW OF HOW CONSUMER

00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:36.942
PREFERENCES AND MEETING THOSE

00:24:37.008 --> 00:24:39.177
PREFERENCES CAN ALSO IMPACT THE

00:24:39.244 --> 00:24:40.378
PERFORMANCE OF LEGAL SPORTS

00:24:40.445 --> 00:24:42.614
BETTING MARKET DETOUR BRIEFLY

00:24:42.681 --> 00:24:44.883
INTO SOME RELEVANT LESSONS THAT

00:24:44.950 --> 00:24:45.984
WE CAN LEARN FROM EUROPEAN

00:24:46.051 --> 00:24:47.219
MARKETS BEFORE FINALLY WRAPPING

00:24:47.285 --> 00:24:49.020
UP WITH SOME CONVERSATION

00:24:49.087 --> 00:24:51.489
AROUND THE ILLEGAL MARKET AND

00:24:51.556 --> 00:24:54.125
OTHER REGULATED PRODUCT CAN. OR

00:24:54.192 --> 00:24:56.061
CAN FAIL TO CAPTURE THAT DEMAND.

00:24:56.127 --> 00:24:56.761
STARTING FIRST WITH MARKET

00:24:56.828 --> 00:24:59.197
POTENTIAL. IN TWENTY NINETEEN

00:24:59.264 --> 00:25:00.465
WE ESTIMATE THAT LEGAL SPORTS

00:25:00.532 --> 00:25:01.867
BETTING WILL GENERATE JUST

00:25:01.933 --> 00:25:03.201
UNDER A BILLION DOLLARS IN

00:25:03.268 --> 00:25:05.003
TOTAL TOP LINE REVENUE ACROSS

00:25:05.070 --> 00:25:06.805
THE U. S. WE SEE THAT NUMBER

00:25:06.872 --> 00:25:08.707
GROWING STEADILY TO JUST UNDER

00:25:08.773 --> 00:25:10.642
SIX BILLION DOLLARS BY TWENTY

00:25:10.709 --> 00:25:12.878
TWENTY THREE. OF NOTE BY TWENTY

00:25:12.944 --> 00:25:13.545
TWENTY THREE WE DO EXPECT THAT

00:25:13.612 --> 00:25:15.480
ROUGHLY THIRTY SIX STATES WILL

00:25:15.547 --> 00:25:16.815
OF AUTHORIZED SOME FORM OF

00:25:16.882 --> 00:25:18.683
LEGAL SPORTS BETTING. AND THAT

00:25:18.750 --> 00:25:20.352
IT WILL AS CHAIR GRAY MENTIONED

00:25:20.418 --> 00:25:22.821
HAVE EXCEEDED ITS REACH TO OVER

00:25:22.888 --> 00:25:23.455
50% OF U. S. POPULATION AT THAT

00:25:23.521 --> 00:25:27.058
POINT. IN TERMS OF THE

00:25:27.125 --> 00:25:28.126
CALIFORNIA MARKET OUTLOOK WE

00:25:28.193 --> 00:25:29.561
USE ROUND NUMBERS HERE BECAUSE

00:25:29.628 --> 00:25:30.795
WE DON'T WANT TO PROVIDE A

00:25:30.862 --> 00:25:32.130
SPECIFIC NUMBER AND SUGGEST A

00:25:32.197 --> 00:25:33.598
GREATER SENSE OF CERTAINTY THAT

00:25:33.665 --> 00:25:35.267
WE ACTUALLY HAVE. THESE ARE OF

00:25:35.333 --> 00:25:37.602
COURSE SIMPLY EDUCATED GUESSES.

00:25:37.669 --> 00:25:39.337
ARE EDUCATED GUESS IS THAT

00:25:39.404 --> 00:25:41.706
CALIFORNIA AT BASELINE MATURITY

00:25:41.773 --> 00:25:43.341
WOULD BE A LEGAL SPORTS BETTING

00:25:43.408 --> 00:25:45.377
MARKET WORTH ABOUT TWO POINT

00:25:45.443 --> 00:25:47.178
FIVE BILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY

00:25:47.245 --> 00:25:48.980
IN TERMS OF TOP LINE REVENUE

00:25:49.047 --> 00:25:50.448
AND THAT AS SOON AS BOTH

00:25:50.515 --> 00:25:52.117
RETAIL. AND ONLINE SPORTS

00:25:52.183 --> 00:25:55.186
BETTING. ROUGHLY 85% OF THAT

00:25:55.253 --> 00:25:56.621
TOTAL WOULD BE EXPECTED TO COME

00:25:56.688 --> 00:25:58.256
FROM THE ONLINE SPORTS BETTING

00:25:58.323 --> 00:26:00.125
CHANNEL. AND IN THE ABSENCE OF

00:26:00.191 --> 00:26:01.359
AN ONLINE SPORTS BETTING

00:26:01.426 --> 00:26:03.528
CHANNEL WE ESTIMATE AGAIN TAT

00:26:03.595 --> 00:26:05.563
ROUGHLY RETAIL ONLY SPORTS

00:26:05.630 --> 00:26:07.132
BETTING IN CALIFORNIA WOULD

00:26:07.198 --> 00:26:09.501
GENERATE ABOUT HALF A BILLION

00:26:09.567 --> 00:26:10.035
DOLLARS A YEAR ANNUALLY IN

00:26:10.101 --> 00:26:12.304
REVENUE. SOME OF THE KEY

00:26:12.370 --> 00:26:13.872
FACTORS THAT CAN DRIVE MARKET

00:26:13.939 --> 00:26:15.573
PERFORMANCE IN TERMS OF THE

00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:17.108
POLICY LEVERS THAT YOU ALL HAVE

00:26:17.175 --> 00:26:19.444
ACCESS TO DETERMINE HETHER TO

00:26:19.511 --> 00:26:21.947
THROTTLE BACK OR THROTTLE UP.

00:26:22.013 --> 00:26:22.580
THE PERFORMANCE OF LEGAL SPORTS

00:26:22.647 --> 00:26:25.116
BETTING MARKET. THE FIRST THING

00:26:25.183 --> 00:26:26.384
I WANT TO NOTE HERE IS THAT THE

00:26:26.451 --> 00:26:28.186
PERFORMANCE OF STATES TODAY

00:26:28.253 --> 00:26:29.955
THAT HAVE ENACTED LEGAL SPORTS

00:26:30.021 --> 00:26:31.856
BETTING IS HIGHLY VARIABLE YOU

00:26:31.923 --> 00:26:33.425
CAN SEE A STATE LIKE NEW JERSEY

00:26:33.491 --> 00:26:35.527
IS PERFORMING AT SOME THREE TO

00:26:35.593 --> 00:26:36.995
FOUR TIMES. THE RATE THAT A

00:26:37.062 --> 00:26:38.296
STATE LIKE MISSISSIPPI IS

00:26:38.363 --> 00:26:40.165
PERFORMING AT IN TERMS OF THE

00:26:40.231 --> 00:26:41.433
AMOUNT OF HANDLED THE TOTAL

00:26:41.499 --> 00:26:43.702
AMOUNT OF BETS THAT ARE BEING

00:26:43.768 --> 00:26:45.337
PLACED BY ADULTS IF WE LOOK TO

00:26:45.403 --> 00:26:46.938
RECENT MONTHS. SO WHAT ARE SOME

00:26:47.005 --> 00:26:48.506
OF THE POLICY DECISIONS THAT

00:26:48.573 --> 00:26:50.709
SEPARATE THE STATE'S AND HOW DO

00:26:50.775 --> 00:26:52.644
THEY IMPACT THE RELATIVE

00:26:52.711 --> 00:26:53.478
PERFORMANCE OF VARIOUS LEGAL

00:26:53.545 --> 00:26:55.580
SPORTS BETTING MARKETS. WE'LL

00:26:55.647 --> 00:26:56.848
START FIRST WITH THE QUESTION

00:26:56.915 --> 00:26:58.850
OF SPORTS BETTING DISTRIBUTION

00:26:58.917 --> 00:27:00.685
AS DâN POINTED OUT ONLINE

00:27:00.752 --> 00:27:01.987
SPORTS BETTING IS CURRENTLY

00:27:02.053 --> 00:27:03.521
LEGAL IN ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF

00:27:03.588 --> 00:27:04.823
THE STATES THAT HAVE AUTHORIZED

00:27:04.889 --> 00:27:06.624
SPORTS BETTING SO FAR. AND IN

00:27:06.691 --> 00:27:07.892
THOSE STATES ONLINE SPORTS

00:27:07.959 --> 00:27:09.494
BETTING TENDS TO ACCOUNT FOR

00:27:09.561 --> 00:27:12.030
ROUGHLY 80% OF TOTAL REVENUE IN

00:27:12.097 --> 00:27:14.733
NEW JERSEY IT'S ABOUT 8182% WE

00:27:14.799 --> 00:27:16.868
DO EXPECT AS A SIDE NOTE THAT

00:27:16.935 --> 00:27:18.370
THAT NUMBER WILL STEADILY

00:27:18.436 --> 00:27:20.338
INCREASE OVER TIME. HE WOULD

00:27:20.405 --> 00:27:21.773
NOT SURPRISE ME IF WE WERE

00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:24.275
HAVING THIS CONVERSATION FIVE

00:27:24.342 --> 00:27:25.677
YEARS FROM NOW IF THAT NUMBER

00:27:25.744 --> 00:27:27.545
WAS CLOSER TO NINETY. 14% FOR

00:27:27.612 --> 00:27:29.581
TO MARKET. BECAUSE THAT'S THE

00:27:29.647 --> 00:27:32.050
GENERAL TRAJECTORY OF CONSUMER

00:27:32.117 --> 00:27:35.653
PREFERENCE IS AGAIN MORE AND

00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:38.690
MORE THINGS THROUGH THE ONLINE

00:27:38.757 --> 00:27:42.127
CHANNEL. I WILL THAT IN THE

00:27:42.193 --> 00:27:44.195
STATES THAT HAVE AUTHOR I SAW

HAT ACCOUNT CREATION ILLINOIS

00:27:59.210 --> 00:28:00.078
IS TAKING A SIMILAR APPROACH MY

00:28:00.145 --> 00:28:00.578
HOME STATE OF NEVADA HAS

00:28:00.645 --> 00:28:01.746
ACTUALLY HAVE. PRO TEMPLATE FOR

00:28:01.813 --> 00:28:02.814
NEARLY A DECADE NOW. I WILL

00:28:02.881 --> 00:28:04.015
KNOW THAT AMONG COMMERCIAL

00:28:04.082 --> 00:28:06.184
CASINOS SUPPORT FOR ONLINE

00:28:06.251 --> 00:28:09.387
SPORTS BETTING IS RELATIVELY A

00:28:09.454 --> 00:28:11.990
CONSENSUS POSITION WHEN YOU

00:28:12.057 --> 00:28:13.625
START TALKING ABOUT INDIAN

00:28:13.691 --> 00:28:15.226
COUNTRY INTRACTABLE CASINOS

00:28:15.293 --> 00:28:17.729
IT'S A FAR MORE COMPLEX ISSUE.

00:28:17.796 --> 00:28:18.263
AND THERE'S FAR LESS THE

00:28:18.329 --> 00:28:19.564
CONSENSUS IN IN IN COUNTRY

00:28:19.631 --> 00:28:21.166
REGARDING RELATIVE MERITS OF

00:28:21.232 --> 00:28:29.741
ONLINE SPORTS BETTING. AND YOU

00:28:29.808 --> 00:28:31.543
CAN LOOK TO PENNSYLVANIA AS AN

00:28:31.609 --> 00:28:33.678
EXAMPLE OF A HIGH TAX STATE

00:28:33.745 --> 00:28:35.013
THIRTY SIX PERCENT. OF GIGI ARE

00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:36.514
SO SAFE TO SAY THAT THERE IS NO

00:28:36.581 --> 00:28:38.917
CONSENSUS AMONG STATES WHEN IT

00:28:38.983 --> 00:28:39.651
COMESTO WHAT IS THE

00:28:39.717 --> 00:28:41.686
APPROPRIATE TAX RATE. FOR

00:28:41.753 --> 00:28:43.254
REGULATED SPORTS BETTING. I

00:28:43.321 --> 00:28:44.789
WILL KNOW TO FEW THINGS STATES

00:28:44.856 --> 00:28:46.925
WITH BIG TICKET TAX RATES HAVE

00:28:46.991 --> 00:28:48.593
DEFINITELY BEEN THE EXCEPTION

00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:50.495
AND NOT THE RULE SO IF YOU

00:28:50.562 --> 00:28:51.930
LOOK. TO THE MIDDLE WERE STATES

00:28:51.996 --> 00:28:53.598
ARE LANDING ON THIS QUESTION

00:28:53.665 --> 00:28:55.100
THEY ARE LANDING ON TAX RATES

00:28:55.166 --> 00:28:57.102
THAT TEND TO DRIFT BELOW TWENTY

00:28:57.168 --> 00:28:58.503
PERCENT. THERE IS SOME

00:28:58.570 --> 00:29:00.405
AVAILABLE RESEARCH ON THIS

00:29:00.472 --> 00:29:01.406
QUESTION FROM INTERNATIONAL

00:29:01.473 --> 00:29:03.308
MARKETS AND IT DOES SUGGEST

00:29:03.374 --> 00:29:05.143
THAT 20% IS RIGHT AROUND THE

00:29:05.210 --> 00:29:06.811
THRESHOLD WHERE AS YOU MOVE TAX

00:29:06.878 --> 00:29:08.513
RATES ABOVE THAT THRESHOLD.

00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:10.315
YOUR ABILITY TO CAPTURE DEMAND

00:29:10.381 --> 00:29:12.250
FROM THE ILLEGAL MARKET WHICH

00:29:12.317 --> 00:29:13.618
DOES NOT SUFFER UNDERNEATH THE

00:29:13.685 --> 00:29:15.653
SAME SORT OF TAX BURDEN. DROPS

00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:17.689
OFF DISPROPORTIONATELY AND I

00:29:17.755 --> 00:29:19.190
FURTHER NOTE FOR MEMBERS THAT

00:29:19.257 --> 00:29:21.126
THE STATE TAX RATE IS NOT THE

00:29:21.192 --> 00:29:22.861
ONLY TOP LINE TAX BURDEN AT

00:29:22.927 --> 00:29:23.995
OPERATORS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO

00:29:24.062 --> 00:29:26.131
PAY. COMMERCIAL SPORTS BETTING

00:29:26.197 --> 00:29:27.966
OPERATORS ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO A

00:29:28.032 --> 00:29:29.501
FEDERAL TAX IT'S CALLED THE-

00:29:29.567 --> 00:29:31.769
EXCISE WAGERING TAX. AND THAT

00:29:31.836 --> 00:29:33.771
IS POINT 25% ON THE TOTAL

00:29:33.838 --> 00:29:36.541
AMOUNT BET OR HANDLE ROUGHLY

00:29:36.608 --> 00:29:38.176
SPEAKING THAT TRANSLATES INTO

00:29:38.243 --> 00:29:40.845
ABOUT A 5% TAX. ON REVENUE SO

00:29:40.912 --> 00:29:43.481
OPERATORS AREN'T STARTING AT 0%

00:29:43.548 --> 00:29:44.782
TAX AND THEN STATE TAX COMES

00:29:44.849 --> 00:29:46.918
INTO PLAY. COMMERCIAL OPERATORS

00:29:46.985 --> 00:29:48.887
ARE STARTING AT ROUGHLY A 5%

00:29:48.953 --> 00:29:50.021
TAX THANKS TO THE FEDERAL

00:29:50.088 --> 00:29:51.956
GOVERNMENT AND THEN ANY TAX

00:29:52.023 --> 00:29:53.525
THAT THE STATE ADD ON TOP OF

00:29:53.591 --> 00:29:56.194
THAT. IS OBVIOUSLY ADDITIVE. I

00:29:56.261 --> 00:29:57.795
THINK IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING

00:29:57.862 --> 00:29:58.396
AND AGAIN I'M HAPPY TO SHARE

00:29:58.463 --> 00:29:59.864
THAT THE RESEARCH THAT'S

00:29:59.931 --> 00:30:00.965
AVAILABLE ON THE SUBJECT BUT

00:30:01.032 --> 00:30:02.667
THE HIGHER THE TAX RATE

00:30:02.734 --> 00:30:04.802
GENERALLY SPEAKING. THE LOWER

00:30:04.869 --> 00:30:07.205
YOUR RATE OF A LEGAL MARKET

00:30:07.272 --> 00:30:10.041
CAPTURE. BECAUSE YOU AS YOU

00:30:10.108 --> 00:30:13.077
INCREASED TAX RATES YOU

00:30:13.144 --> 00:30:16.814
DECREASE THE ABILITY OF

00:30:16.881 --> 00:30:20.885
OPERATORS TO DO THINGS LIKE

00:30:20.952 --> 00:30:24.989
PRICE ODDS IN A WAY THAT

00:30:25.056 --> 00:30:28.760
COMPETITIVE THE ELITE. MARKET

00:30:28.826 --> 00:30:35.233
AND ALL PROMOTE. TWENTY MILLION

00:30:35.300 --> 00:30:36.201
THAT DOES REQUIRE LITTLE

00:30:36.267 --> 00:30:37.535
CRACKING OF THE NECK WHEN YOU

00:30:37.602 --> 00:30:38.937
SAY THAT NUMBER A TWENTY

00:30:39.003 --> 00:30:40.572
MILLION DOLLAR LICENSE FEE FOR

00:30:40.638 --> 00:30:41.973
AN ONLINE ONLY SPORTS BETTING

00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:43.975
LICENSE. IT'S NOT HARD TO SEE

00:30:44.042 --> 00:30:45.577
WHY POLICYMAKERS AND SOME

00:30:45.643 --> 00:30:47.612
STATES ARE TAKING THAT APPROACH

00:30:47.679 --> 00:30:49.314
BECAUSE LICENSE FEES DO PROVIDE

00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:51.182
FOR SOME STATES. A USEFUL ONE

00:30:51.249 --> 00:30:53.351
TIME INJECTION OF FUNDS INTO

00:30:53.418 --> 00:30:55.119
THE BUDGET. I WILL NOTE THAT

00:30:55.186 --> 00:30:56.387
LICENSE FEES ESPECIALLY AT THAT

00:30:56.454 --> 00:30:58.122
LEVEL ESSENTIALLY SERVE AS A

00:30:58.189 --> 00:31:00.792
NOTHER FORM OF TAXATION. AND A

00:31:00.858 --> 00:31:03.761
NOTHER ASPECT THAT IS GOING TO

00:31:03.828 --> 00:31:05.296
PULL RESOURCES AWAY FROM

00:31:05.363 --> 00:31:06.764
PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT. FROM THE

00:31:06.831 --> 00:31:08.333
ABILITY OF OPERATORS TO OFFER

00:31:08.399 --> 00:31:09.400
COMPETITIVE ODDS WITH THE

00:31:09.467 --> 00:31:11.202
ILLEGAL MARKET FROM THE ABILITY

00:31:11.269 --> 00:31:13.104
OF OPERATORS TO PUT MONEY INTO

00:31:13.171 --> 00:31:14.939
MARKETING. AND TO DRAW DEMAND

00:31:15.006 --> 00:31:16.441
AND RAISE AWARENESS AWAY FROM

00:31:16.507 --> 00:31:17.875
THE ILLEGAL MARKET AND AGAIN TO

00:31:17.942 --> 00:31:20.078
OFFER THE KINDS OF BONUSES AND

00:31:20.144 --> 00:31:20.678
PROMOTIONS THE YOU MIGHT FIND

00:31:20.745 --> 00:31:23.047
IT OFFSHORE BETTING SITES. THE

00:31:23.114 --> 00:31:24.115
QUESTION OF WHETHER OR NOT TO

00:31:24.182 --> 00:31:26.417
ACCOMMODATE SPORTS LEAGUES IS A

00:31:26.484 --> 00:31:27.852
NOTHER ISSUE WERE STATES HAVE

00:31:27.919 --> 00:31:29.621
BEEN SPLIT- THE LEAGUE'S DO

00:31:29.687 --> 00:31:31.422
CONTINUE TO LOBBY AGGRESSIVELY

00:31:31.489 --> 00:31:32.924
ACROSS THE UNITED STATES PER

00:31:32.991 --> 00:31:34.826
SEAT AT THE TABLE. IN TERMS OF

00:31:34.892 --> 00:31:36.894
REGULATED SPORTS BETTING THERE

00:31:36.961 --> 00:31:38.596
ARE FEW ASKS AND THE LEAGUES

00:31:38.663 --> 00:31:40.131
ARE CERTAINLY NOT HOMOGENEOUS

00:31:40.198 --> 00:31:41.099
IN THEIR APPROACH AND I'M SURE

00:31:41.165 --> 00:31:42.667
YOU'LL HEAR. A COUPLE OF

00:31:42.734 --> 00:31:43.534
DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES FROM THE

00:31:43.601 --> 00:31:46.037
LEAKS TODAY THE PRIMARY FOCUS

00:31:46.104 --> 00:31:47.605
THAT I'VE PERSONALLY SEEN IN MY

00:31:47.672 --> 00:31:49.574
WORK AT VARIOUS STATE CAPITALS.

00:31:49.641 --> 00:31:50.808
APPEARS TO BE AROUND THE

00:31:50.875 --> 00:31:52.877
CONCEPT OF ASKING THE

00:31:52.944 --> 00:31:55.313
LEGISLATURE TO MANDATE THAT

00:31:55.380 --> 00:31:57.248
LEGAL SPORTS BETTING OPERATORS

00:31:57.315 --> 00:32:00.018
MUST USE LEAGUE APPROVED DATA

00:32:00.084 --> 00:32:01.486
IN ORDER TO MAKE AND TO SETTLE

00:32:01.552 --> 00:32:03.788
BETS. THERE ARE ALSO SOME OTHER

00:32:03.855 --> 00:32:05.390
AREAS OF INTEREST FOR THE

00:32:05.456 --> 00:32:06.758
LEAGUE SUCH AS CONTROL OVER

00:32:06.824 --> 00:32:08.826
WHAT KIND OF BAD SCANNING CAM

00:32:08.893 --> 00:32:11.029
PLACED. THERE ARE A COUPLE OF

00:32:11.095 --> 00:32:12.230
STATES INCLUDING ILLINOIS IN

00:32:12.297 --> 00:32:14.332
TENNESSEE THAT HAVE ENACTED A

00:32:14.399 --> 00:32:16.401
REQUIREMENT. THAT REGULATED

00:32:16.467 --> 00:32:19.504
OPERATORS USE OFFICIAL DATA THE

00:32:19.570 --> 00:32:22.040
ONLY NOTE I WOULD MAKE HERE IS

00:32:22.106 --> 00:32:23.808
THAT SUCH MANDATES DO AGAIN. AT

00:32:23.875 --> 00:32:26.911
AN ADDITIONAL COST TO REGULATED

00:32:26.978 --> 00:32:28.479
OPERATIONS AND WITH EACH

00:32:28.546 --> 00:32:30.481
ADDITIONAL COST. YOU DO SEE

00:32:30.548 --> 00:32:31.749
SOMETHING TAKEN AWAY FROM THE

00:32:31.816 --> 00:32:33.651
OTHER SIDE OF THE SCALE IN

00:32:33.718 --> 00:32:36.054
TERMS OF THESE OPERATORS BEING

00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:38.823
ABLE TO BE- MAXIMALLY

00:32:38.890 --> 00:32:39.390
COMPETITIVE WITH THE ILLEGAL

00:32:39.457 --> 00:32:42.226
PRODUCT. ANOTHER POLICY- WORTH

00:32:42.293 --> 00:32:43.461
DISCUSSING IS A QUESTION OF

00:32:43.528 --> 00:32:44.095
MARKET ACCESS WHO CAN APPLY FOR

00:32:44.162 --> 00:32:44.729
INSTANCE HOW MANY UNIQUE BRANDS

00:32:44.796 --> 00:32:46.831
CAN BE OPERATED UNDERNEATH EACH

00:32:46.898 --> 00:32:48.766
INDIVIDUAL LICENSE. IF YOU TAKE

00:32:48.833 --> 00:32:50.134
A STATE LIKE NEW JERSEY THE

00:32:50.201 --> 00:32:52.103
MOST EXPANSIVE APPROACH TO THIS

00:32:52.170 --> 00:32:54.105
QUESTION SO FAR. THEY LIMITED

00:32:54.172 --> 00:32:55.873
THEIR KEY LICENSES TO THE

00:32:55.940 --> 00:32:57.408
STATE'S EXISTING CASINOS AND

00:32:57.475 --> 00:32:59.310
RACE TRACKS. AND THEN THEY SAID

00:32:59.377 --> 00:33:01.245
EACH OF THOSE KEY LICENSES CAN

00:33:01.312 --> 00:33:02.980
OPERATE UP TO THREE DISTINCT

00:33:03.047 --> 00:33:05.550
BRANDS. UNDER EACH ONE OF THOSE

00:33:05.616 --> 00:33:07.352
LICENSES THERE THERE'S A

00:33:07.418 --> 00:33:08.453
QUESTION ABOUT A FOURTEENTH

00:33:08.519 --> 00:33:09.854
LICENSE THAT'S HOW WE GET TO

00:33:09.921 --> 00:33:12.090
FORTY TWO- MY MATH IS NOT QUITE

00:33:12.156 --> 00:33:14.125
THAT BAD. THIRTEEN TIMES THREE

00:33:14.192 --> 00:33:15.827
THIRTY NINE. WE GET AN EXTRA

00:33:15.893 --> 00:33:17.095
THREE BECAUSE OF AN INACTIVE-

00:33:17.161 --> 00:33:19.030
LICENSE IN NEW JERSEY. THE

00:33:19.097 --> 00:33:20.965
QUESTION OF MARKET ACCESS AGAIN

00:33:21.032 --> 00:33:22.500
HAS SOME IMPLICATIONS AROUND

00:33:22.567 --> 00:33:23.835
HOW COMPETITIVE YOUR MARKET IS

00:33:23.901 --> 00:33:25.903
GOING TO BE. THEY ALSO HAS SOME

00:33:25.970 --> 00:33:26.671
IMPLICATIONS THAT ARE QUITE AS

00:33:26.738 --> 00:33:29.207
OBVIOUS AS SPECIFICALLY WHAT

00:33:29.273 --> 00:33:31.809
THE ECONOMIC VALUE OF A KEY

00:33:31.876 --> 00:33:34.679
LICENSE IS. AND IF YOU THINK

00:33:34.746 --> 00:33:35.546
ABOUT A SMALLER WHETHER BE

00:33:35.613 --> 00:33:37.615
TRIBAL WAR COMMERCIAL OPERATOR

00:33:37.682 --> 00:33:39.884
OR RACE TRACK WE'VE SEEN IN

00:33:39.951 --> 00:33:41.352
STATES LIKE NEW JERSEY THAT

00:33:41.419 --> 00:33:42.420
SMALLER OPERATORS HAVE BEEN

00:33:42.487 --> 00:33:44.422
ABLE TO LEVERAGE THEIR MARKET

00:33:44.489 --> 00:33:45.957
ACCESS. AS A SIGNIFICANT

00:33:46.023 --> 00:33:48.059
ECONOMIC ASSET SO SMALLER

00:33:48.126 --> 00:33:49.594
CASINO CAN SAY TO A COMPANY

00:33:49.660 --> 00:33:51.963
LIKE DRAFTKINGS OUR FANDUEL I'M

00:33:52.029 --> 00:33:53.564
GOING TO BASICALLY ALLOW YOU TO

00:33:53.631 --> 00:33:54.966
COME IN UNDER MY LICENSE. AND

00:33:55.032 --> 00:33:56.234
IN EXCHANGE I'M GOING TO CHARGE

00:33:56.300 --> 00:33:58.102
YOU AN UP FRONT FEE AND SOME

00:33:58.169 --> 00:33:59.337
ERCENTAGE OF THE REVENUE THAT

00:33:59.404 --> 00:34:00.071
YOU GENERATE UNDER THAT

00:34:00.138 --> 00:34:02.240
LICENSE. SO MARKET ACCESS AS

00:34:02.306 --> 00:34:04.008
MARKET ACCESS QUESTIONS NOT

00:34:04.075 --> 00:34:06.277
ONLY IMPACT THE OVERALL SHAPING

00:34:06.344 --> 00:34:07.812
CONTOURING COMPETITIVENESS OF

00:34:07.879 --> 00:34:10.114
THE MARKETS BUT THEY ALSO

00:34:10.181 --> 00:34:12.083
PROVIDE ANOTHER ECONOMIC

00:34:12.150 --> 00:34:12.650
OPPORTUNITY FOR KEY LICENSE

00:34:12.717 --> 00:34:14.986
HOLDERS. SO SOME QUICK

00:34:15.052 --> 00:34:16.020
TAKEAWAYS HERE MOST STATES ARE

00:34:16.087 --> 00:34:17.355
CHARTING THEIR OWN COURSE ON

00:34:17.422 --> 00:34:18.089
SPORTS BETTING THERE IS NO

00:34:18.156 --> 00:34:20.057
TEMPLATE THERE IS NO PLAYBOOK.

00:34:20.124 --> 00:34:22.193
THE STAKEHOLDERS IN A LOCAL

00:34:23.694 --> 00:34:25.763
AGENDAS THAT DRIVE POLICY IN

00:34:25.830 --> 00:34:26.531
ONE DIRECTION AND THAT

00:34:26.597 --> 00:34:27.965
DIRECTION MAY NOT NECESSARILY

00:34:28.032 --> 00:34:29.967
BE- IN PARALLEL WITH THE

DIRECTION OF THE MOST

00:34:31.202 --> 00:34:32.570
COMPETITIVE IN THE MOST ROBUST

00:34:32.637 --> 00:34:34.839

00:34:38.643 --> 00:34:40.812
AND OTHER POLICY QUESTIONS BY

00:34:59.263 --> 00:35:01.399
VERY STATES VARIOUS SURVEYS.

00:35:01.466 --> 00:35:02.867
RESOUNDINGLY THESE ARE THE

00:35:02.934 --> 00:35:04.335
ISSUES THAT CONSUMERS TELL US

00:35:04.402 --> 00:35:06.337
ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT TO THEM

00:35:06.404 --> 00:35:07.839
IN TERMS OF LEGAL SPORTS

00:35:07.905 --> 00:35:09.507
BETTING. THEY WANT FIRST GOOD

00:35:09.574 --> 00:35:11.609
ODDS AND PRICING. THEY WANT

00:35:11.676 --> 00:35:13.344
SECOND EASY ACCESS TO THEIR

00:35:13.411 --> 00:35:16.714

VARIETY OF WAYS TO BET NOT ONLY

00:35:24.155 --> 00:35:28.259
IN TERMS OF. TYPES OF BETS BUT

00:35:28.326 --> 00:35:29.293
THE AMOUNT OF MARKETS TO BET

00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:31.195
ON. OF THE VERY TURNED WITH THE

00:35:31.262 --> 00:35:32.763
OVERALL FAIRNESS LIKE

ASSURANCES THAT THAT PROVIDES.

00:35:36.901 --> 00:35:38.636
AND FINALLY THEY ARE OF COURSE-

00:35:38.703 --> 00:35:41.105
BEING GAMBLERS INTERESTED IN

00:35:41.172 --> 00:35:43.341
GENEROUS PROMOTIONS AND BONUSES.

EUROPE AND AGAIN I'M HAPPY TO

00:35:45.810 --> 00:35:48.012

00:36:06.931 --> 00:36:08.633
CONTRAST THOSE TWO MARKETS WITH

00:36:08.699 --> 00:36:10.468
FRANCE AS YOU CAN SEE FRANCE

00:36:10.535 --> 00:36:11.769
HAS A TAX RATE OF FIFTY

00:36:11.836 --> 00:36:13.638
PERCENT. COMPARED WITH TAX

00:36:13.704 --> 00:36:15.106
RATES OF 20% IN DENMARK AND U.

00:36:15.172 --> 00:36:17.642
K. ALSO SOME RESTRICTIONS ON

00:36:17.708 --> 00:36:19.610
WHAT CAN AND CANNOT BE BET ON.

00:36:19.677 --> 00:36:21.312

PERFORMING THOSE TWO MARKETS IN

00:36:35.860 --> 00:36:37.562
TERMS OF THE PENETRATION RATE

00:36:37.628 --> 00:36:39.363
SO HOW MANY CONSUMERS IN THE

00:36:39.430 --> 00:36:40.665
MARKET ARE ACTIVELY

00:36:40.731 --> 00:36:42.400
PARTICIPATING IN LEGAL SPORTS

00:36:42.466 --> 00:36:45.002

ONLY FEWER ACTIVE PLAYERS BUT

THOSE WHO ACTUALLY ARE ACTIVE

00:36:53.411 --> 00:36:55.346
ARE STILL SPENDING LESS ON

00:36:55.413 --> 00:36:57.515
AVERAGE. THE LESSONS THAT WE

00:36:57.582 --> 00:36:59.283
TAKE AWAY FROM EUROPE BRIEFLY

00:36:59.350 --> 00:37:02.119
HI TAX RATES. ABSOLUTELY APPEAR

00:37:10.561 --> 00:37:10.962
LIMITER ON GROUP BOTH.

DIRECTIONS ON THE CONNIE. IN

00:37:13.731 --> 00:37:15.232
THAT CAN. OFTEN BE THE TYPES.

00:37:15.299 --> 00:37:16.000
OR WHAT EVENT YOU CAN BET ON

00:37:16.067 --> 00:37:16.701
HAS THAT SIMILAR RESTRICTIVE

00:37:16.767 --> 00:37:18.803
IMPACT ON GROWTH. CONSUMERS

00:37:18.869 --> 00:37:20.671
GENERALLY RESPOND WELL TO

00:37:20.738 --> 00:37:23.007
CHOICE AND CONTROL AND A

00:37:23.074 --> 00:37:24.275
CAUTIONARY TALE IT'S EMERGING

00:37:24.342 --> 00:37:25.943
FROM EUROPE DISTINCT FROM OUR

00:37:26.010 --> 00:37:27.378
ANALYSIS OF FRANCE DENMARK AND

00:37:27.445 --> 00:37:29.680
U. K. IS THAT SOME CONTROLS

00:37:29.747 --> 00:37:32.049
SOME PROACTIVE CONTROLS AROUND

00:37:32.116 --> 00:37:34.752
MARKETING. SET FORTH IN ADVANCE

00:37:34.819 --> 00:37:36.520
BY THE LEGISLATURE MAY

00:37:36.587 --> 00:37:37.922
CONTRIBUTE TO A MORE

00:37:37.989 --> 00:37:40.658
SUSTAINABLE AND A MORE

00:37:40.725 --> 00:37:41.225
PRODUCTIVE REGULATED SPORTS

00:37:41.292 --> 00:37:43.527
BETTING MARKET. FINALLY I WANT

00:37:43.594 --> 00:37:45.496
TO CLOSE WITH A FEW COMMENTS ON

00:37:45.563 --> 00:37:46.030
THE ILLEGAL SPORTS BETTING

00:37:46.097 --> 00:37:49.800
MARKET. CURRENTLY WE ESTIMATE

00:37:49.867 --> 00:37:51.502
THAT THE REVENUE VALUE FOR

00:37:51.569 --> 00:37:52.903
ILLEGAL SPORTS BETTING IN THE

00:37:52.970 --> 00:37:53.971
U. S. IS ABOUT THREE POINT FIVE

00:37:54.038 --> 00:37:55.940
BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR IN HERE

00:37:56.007 --> 00:37:57.775
WE DO NOT INCLUDE THINGS LIKE

00:37:57.842 --> 00:37:59.610
BETS BETWEEN FRIENDS OR OFFICE

00:37:59.677 --> 00:38:01.946
POOLS WHICH HELPS TO EXPLAIN

00:38:02.013 --> 00:38:03.014
THE DISPARITY BETWEEN OUR

00:38:03.080 --> 00:38:03.981
ESTIMATES AND SOME OTHER

00:38:04.048 --> 00:38:05.549
ESTIMATES THAT YOU MIGHT SEE.

00:38:05.616 --> 00:38:07.451
WE COUNT ABOUT FOURTEEN MILLION

00:38:07.518 --> 00:38:09.654
AMERICANS WHO ARE ANNUALLY

00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:10.921
BETTING ON OFFSHORE SITES ARE

00:38:10.988 --> 00:38:13.024
ACTIVELY WITH A BOOKIE AND WE

00:38:13.090 --> 00:38:15.593
KNOW THAT THE TYPICAL HOLD RATE

00:38:15.660 --> 00:38:17.628
FOR AN ILLEGAL SPORTS BOOK IS

00:38:17.695 --> 00:38:19.864
ABOUT FIVE PERCENT. SO WHEN WE

00:38:19.930 --> 00:38:21.165
TALK ABOUT THE IMPACT OF TAX

00:38:21.232 --> 00:38:22.400
THE **** WE'LL TALK ABOUT THE

00:38:22.466 --> 00:38:23.901
IMPACT OF LICENSE FEES ENOUGH

00:38:23.968 --> 00:38:25.569
THE RESTRICTIONS THOSE ALMOST

00:38:25.636 --> 00:38:28.139
NECESSARILY PUT THE HOLD RATE

00:38:28.205 --> 00:38:30.374
UP FOR THE LEGAL PRODUCT TO

00:38:30.441 --> 00:38:32.209
COMPENSATE FOR THE INCREASED

00:38:32.276 --> 00:38:32.777
COST THEY HAVE THAT'S THE

00:38:32.843 --> 00:38:33.611
FUNDAMENTAL CAN. SEND THAT

00:38:33.678 --> 00:38:38.049
CONSUMERS CAN VERY EASILY MAKE

00:38:38.115 --> 00:38:41.619
BETWEEN ILLEGAL BETS AND LEGAL

00:38:41.686 --> 00:38:43.921
THAT'S THE PRICE IS RIGHT THERE

00:38:43.988 --> 00:38:48.325
ON THE ACT PRICE COMPARISON IS

00:38:48.392 --> 00:38:50.494
EASY IN SPORTS BETTING AND AS A

00:38:50.561 --> 00:38:52.630
RESULT PRICE CITY IS A VERY

00:38:52.697 --> 00:38:56.133
REAL. THING FOR CONSUMERS. IT

00:38:56.200 --> 00:38:57.568
WAS IN COMMENTS ABOUT THE

00:38:57.635 --> 00:38:58.202
CONSUMER'S POINT OF VIEW ON THE

00:38:58.269 --> 00:38:59.236
ILLEGAL MARK. POURTANT REALIZE

00:38:59.303 --> 00:38:59.837
A FEW THINGS ONE THE ILLEGAL

00:38:59.904 --> 00:39:00.337
MARKET IS UBIQUITOUS AND

00:39:00.404 --> 00:39:00.938
READILY ACCESSIBLE THERE ARE

00:39:01.005 --> 00:39:02.006
VERY FEW BARRIERS TO ENTRY FROM

00:39:02.073 --> 00:39:02.673
THE CONSUMER'S PERSPECTIVE

00:39:02.740 --> 00:39:04.241
SECOND THE ILLEGAL MARKET HOLDS

00:39:04.308 --> 00:39:06.143
SOME ADVANTAGES OVER THE

00:39:06.210 --> 00:39:07.511
REGULATED MARKET THAT THE

00:39:07.578 --> 00:39:09.947
REGULATED MARKET WILL NEVER BE

00:39:10.014 --> 00:39:12.183
ABLE TO MATCH. THINGS LIKE THE

00:39:12.249 --> 00:39:13.751
ABILITY FOR CONSUMERS TO BET ON

00:39:13.818 --> 00:39:15.486
CREDIT THINGS LIKE THE

00:39:15.553 --> 00:39:17.421
ABILITIES TO BET IN A WAY THAT

00:39:17.488 --> 00:39:19.190
IS ANONYMOUS YOU'RE RELATIVELY

00:39:19.256 --> 00:39:20.858
OR HOLY AND YOU KNOW TO BE

00:39:20.925 --> 00:39:22.560
HONEST ABOUT IT THE ABILITY TO

00:39:22.626 --> 00:39:25.730
NOT PAY TAXES WHEN YOU WIN. AND

00:39:25.796 --> 00:39:27.298
OFFSHORE SITE OR WITHIN A LEGAL

00:39:27.364 --> 00:39:29.734
BOOKMAKER THE OTHER THING THAT

00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:30.935
THE ILLEGAL MARKET HAS GOING

00:39:31.001 --> 00:39:32.570
FOR IT IS THE FACT THAT IT IS

00:39:32.636 --> 00:39:34.438
AN ENTRENCHED HABIT FOR A

00:39:34.505 --> 00:39:36.941
SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF CONSUMERS

00:39:37.007 --> 00:39:39.910
THE UPSHOT FROM ALL OF THIS IS

00:39:39.977 --> 00:39:41.879
THAT POLICY MAKERS MUST MAKE

00:39:41.946 --> 00:39:44.682
ALL DECISIONS WITH THE CONTEXT.

00:39:44.749 --> 00:39:46.450
OF RE IGNITING THE ILLEGAL

00:39:46.517 --> 00:39:47.818
MARKET IS HERE IT IS ACTIVE IT

00:39:47.885 --> 00:39:48.619
IS IT FRENCH AND IT WILL

00:39:48.686 --> 00:39:50.955
MAINTAIN SOME ADVANTAGES OVER

00:39:51.021 --> 00:39:52.323
THE LEGAL PRODUCT THAT CAN

00:39:52.389 --> 00:39:53.924
SIMPLY NEVER BE MATCHED BY THAT

00:39:53.991 --> 00:39:55.826
PRODUCT AS A RESULT I BELIEVE

00:39:55.893 --> 00:39:57.027
THAT IT'S IMPERATIVE FOR THE

00:39:57.094 --> 00:39:58.896
LEGAL MARKET TO BE CONSTRUCTED

00:39:58.963 --> 00:40:00.998
IN A WAY. THAT POSITIONS ITSELF

00:40:01.065 --> 00:40:02.566
AS THE MOST APPEALING OF

00:40:02.633 --> 00:40:05.703
ALTERNATIVE POSSIBLE TO THAT

00:40:05.770 --> 00:40:09.874
ILLEGAL MARKET NOT ONLY FOR THE

00:40:09.940 --> 00:40:12.143
GOOD OF THE MARKET IN TERMS OF

00:40:12.209 --> 00:40:14.311
A REVENUE PERSPECTIVE BUT FROM

00:40:14.378 --> 00:40:15.813
A MORE BASIC PUBLIC I'LL SEE

00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:18.783
FACTORED IN THE OUR- SITE

00:40:18.849 --> 00:40:21.552
CONNECT. ACTIVITY NOT KIND OF

00:40:21.619 --> 00:40:23.788
REVENUE OUT OF THE ILLEGAL

00:40:23.854 --> 00:40:26.157
MARKET WORK IT ALMOST

00:40:26.223 --> 00:40:27.525

WE HAVE THE POWER POINT HERE.

00:41:07.498 --> 00:41:08.465
IN OUR MINDS BUT SOME OF THE

00:41:08.532 --> 00:41:09.867
OTHER- REFERENCE FUTURE WOULD

00:41:09.934 --> 00:41:12.102
BE HELPFUL AS WELL. AS WELL AS

00:41:12.169 --> 00:41:13.871

IT BACK TO THE MEMBERS FOR

00:41:17.741 --> 00:41:26.183
QUESTIONS. HI YA. IN A PINCH

00:41:26.250 --> 00:41:29.987
HITTER HERE. SO KEEP A VERY

00:41:30.054 --> 00:41:32.623
BRIEF BUT YOU SAID INDIAN

00:41:32.690 --> 00:41:34.091
TRIBES ARE COMPLEX ON THIS

00:41:34.158 --> 00:41:36.927
ISSUE WHAT ARE THE TOP THREE

00:41:36.994 --> 00:41:40.464
COMPLEXITIES PLEASE. SURE SO I

00:41:40.531 --> 00:41:42.466
DON'T IN NO PARTICULAR ORDER-

00:41:42.533 --> 00:41:44.435
INDIAN TRIBES HAVE TO CONTEND

00:41:44.501 --> 00:41:45.970
WITH THE CONSTRAINTS OF A GRIP

00:41:46.036 --> 00:41:47.872
WHICH PLACES DIFFERENT

00:41:47.938 --> 00:41:48.539
CONSTRAINTS AROUND THEIR

00:41:48.606 --> 00:41:49.974
ABILITY TO OFFER ONLINE SPORTS

00:41:50.040 --> 00:41:52.543
BETTING VERSES HOW COMMERCIAL

00:41:52.610 --> 00:41:53.878
OPERATOR MIGHT APPROACH ONLINE

00:41:53.944 --> 00:41:56.313
SPORTS BETTING. TO SOME BUT NOT

00:41:56.380 --> 00:41:57.548
ALL MAY HAVE TO RE OPEN THEIR

00:41:57.615 --> 00:41:59.316
CONTACTS WITH THE STATE IN

00:41:59.383 --> 00:42:01.652
ORDER TO CONSIDER THE QUESTION

00:42:01.719 --> 00:42:03.187
OF SPORTS BETTING AND THEY MAY

00:42:03.254 --> 00:42:04.889
VIEW THAT AS A RISK THAT IS

00:42:04.955 --> 00:42:06.223
SIMPLY NOT WORTH TAKING FOR THE

00:42:06.290 --> 00:42:08.292
RELATIVE UPSIDE OF SPORTS

00:42:08.359 --> 00:42:10.127
BETTING AND FINALLY I THINK

00:42:10.194 --> 00:42:12.329
THAT. IF YOU AND I DON'T WANT

00:42:12.396 --> 00:42:14.365
TO SPEAK AS IF INDIAN COUNTRIES

00:42:14.431 --> 00:42:16.133
MARGINS BECAUSE IT OBVIOUSLY IS

00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:18.369
NOT BUT THERE I THINK IS A

00:42:18.435 --> 00:42:19.770
CONCERN THAT I'VE HEARD

00:42:19.837 --> 00:42:21.672
EXPRESSED IN INDIAN COUNTRY

00:42:21.739 --> 00:42:24.675
AMONG SOME TRIBES THAT THE

00:42:24.742 --> 00:42:27.177
PERCEIVED BENEFITS OF SPORTS

00:42:27.244 --> 00:42:30.581
BETTING SEEM RELATIVELY SMALL

00:42:30.648 --> 00:42:31.215
FROM THEIR PERSPECTIVE. SLOT OF

00:42:31.282 --> 00:42:33.217
NEW FOR EXAMPLE. AND IN EACH

00:42:33.284 --> 00:42:34.351
INCH FOR OPENING THE DOOR EVEN

00:42:34.418 --> 00:42:35.019
THOSE RELATIVELY SMALL BENEFITS

00:42:35.085 --> 00:42:36.220
THEY'RE CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT

00:42:36.287 --> 00:42:37.788
OTHER KINDS OF GAMBLING MIGHT

00:42:37.855 --> 00:42:40.024
COME THROUGH THAT DOOR ONCE

00:42:40.090 --> 00:42:41.558
IT'S OPENED I OFTEN SAY THAT

00:42:41.625 --> 00:42:42.760
THE HISTORY OF GAMBLING IN THE

00:42:42.826 --> 00:42:44.662
U. S. IS A SERIES OF. MASSIVE

00:42:44.728 --> 00:42:46.030
EXCEPTIONS SQUEEZE THROUGH VERY

00:42:46.096 --> 00:42:48.399
SMALL LOOPHOLES THIS IS HOW YOU

00:42:48.465 --> 00:42:49.833
KNOW VARIOUS THINGS THAT WERE

00:42:49.900 --> 00:42:51.302
NOT SLOT MACHINES BECAME SLOT

00:42:51.368 --> 00:42:53.103
MACHINES RIGHT. SO I THINK

00:42:53.170 --> 00:42:55.239
THERE IS SOME CONCERN THAT.

00:42:55.306 --> 00:42:56.273
WE'RE SAYING THIS IS THE

TRIBES- CASE- IT MAYBE NOT

00:43:33.043 --> 00:43:34.945

00:43:59.069 --> 00:43:59.670
TO REMEDY AND ALLEVIATE THAT TO

00:43:59.737 --> 00:44:01.872

WHAT THE TRIBES MOTIVATION IS

00:44:15.753 --> 00:44:17.955

00:46:50.407 --> 00:46:51.475
LITTLE BIT MORE EFFECTIVELY

00:46:51.542 --> 00:46:53.310

VOTE OF THE PEOPLE YOU'RE GONNA

00:46:54.678 --> 00:46:55.479

CRIME RISKS BUT I DO BELIEVE.

00:47:22.906 --> 00:47:24.808
VERY STRONGLY THAT THE

00:47:24.875 --> 00:47:26.343
CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION DOES

00:47:26.410 --> 00:47:28.111

00:48:47.991 --> 00:48:50.627
MOST STATES- GAMBLING HAS

00:48:50.694 --> 00:48:52.129
BECOME A MUCH BIGGER PART OF

00:48:52.195 --> 00:48:54.264
ECONOMIC ACTIVITY ON A STATE BY

00:48:54.331 --> 00:48:56.566
STATE BASIS AND THE POLLS TEND

00:48:56.633 --> 00:48:58.135
TO SHOW INCREASING PUBLIC

SUPPORT. FOR LEGALIZED SPORTS

00:49:00.270 --> 00:49:01.438
BETTING. AND I WOULD IMAGINE

00:49:01.505 --> 00:49:03.173
THAT PUBLIC SUPPORT WOULD BE

00:49:03.240 --> 00:49:04.141
THE FACT THAT THERE WOULD BE

00:49:04.207 --> 00:49:05.676
REVENUE TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE

00:49:05.742 --> 00:49:08.011

GENERAL THAT STILL NEEDED BUT

00:49:13.317 --> 00:49:14.584
BUT THAT'S PART OF IT THAT'S

00:49:14.651 --> 00:49:16.620
NOT THE ONLY REASON CERTAINLY-

00:49:16.687 --> 00:49:17.954
THE NUMBER OF NUMBERS YOU KNOW

00:49:18.021 --> 00:49:19.956

RIGHT TO PLACE A BAD AND I

00:49:28.832 --> 00:49:30.067

ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS

00:49:30.867 --> 00:49:33.337

ACTUALLY GOING TO A CASINO

01:03:29.105 --> 01:03:31.908
RACETRACK. IN NEW JERSEY ABOUT

01:03:31.974 --> 01:03:33.543
EIGHTY PERCENT. OF THE SPORTS

CHANNELS. RECOGNIZING THE

01:03:40.917 --> 01:03:42.818
CALIFORNIA'S MANY STAKEHOLDERS

01:03:42.885 --> 01:03:44.020
IN A THRIVING TRIBAL GAMING

01:03:44.086 --> 01:03:45.521
MARKET WE BELIEVE IT IS A

01:03:45.588 --> 01:03:47.323
PUBLIC POLICY DECISION AS TO

01:03:47.390 --> 01:03:48.024
WHERE LEGAL SPORTS BETTING

01:03:48.090 --> 01:03:49.959
WOULD BE PERMITTED. WHETHER OR

01:03:50.026 --> 01:03:51.427
MOBILE SPORTS BETTING WILL BE

01:03:51.494 --> 01:03:53.729
ALLOWED AND IF SO HOW WHEN

01:03:53.796 --> 01:03:54.363
WHERE CUSTOMERS MAY SIGN UP FOR

01:03:54.430 --> 01:03:57.033
THEIR ACCOUNT. SO FAR I ONE

01:03:57.099 --> 01:03:58.034
RHODE ISLAND HAVE FALLEN OF

01:03:58.100 --> 01:03:59.802
THAT IS MODEL WITH RETAIL

01:03:59.869 --> 01:04:02.104
SPORTS BOOKS IN CASINOS. AND IN

01:04:02.171 --> 01:04:03.506
PERSON SIGN UPS FOR MOBILE

01:04:03.573 --> 01:04:05.208
ACCOUNTS. OTHER STATES LIKE

01:04:05.274 --> 01:04:07.009
INDIANA AND PENNSYLVANIA HAVE

01:04:07.076 --> 01:04:09.679
FOLLOW THE NEW JERSEY MODEL IN

01:04:09.745 --> 01:04:10.179
WHICH REMOTE MOBILE APP

01:04:10.246 --> 01:04:12.014
REGISTRATION IS PERMITTED.

01:04:12.081 --> 01:04:13.950
STILL OTHER STATES LIKE

01:04:14.016 --> 01:04:14.584
MISSISSIPPI HAVE PERMITTED ONLY

01:04:14.650 --> 01:04:17.653
RETAIL SPORTS BETTING. SO AS

01:04:17.720 --> 01:04:18.854
YOU THINK ABOUT SPORTS BETTING

01:04:18.921 --> 01:04:20.489
CALIFORNIA I LIKE TO REALLY

01:04:20.556 --> 01:04:23.359
DISCUSS TO MATTERS- THEIR TAX

01:04:23.426 --> 01:04:23.926
RATES AND BETTING ON COLLEGE

01:04:23.993 --> 01:04:27.830
SPORTS. SO WHILE SPORTS BETTING

01:04:27.897 --> 01:04:29.298
IS GONNA GENERATE REVENUE FOR

01:04:29.365 --> 01:04:30.466
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHEN IT

01:04:30.533 --> 01:04:32.168
IS LEGAL. THE REALITY SPORTS

01:04:32.235 --> 01:04:33.202
BETTING IS A LOW MARGIN

01:04:33.269 --> 01:04:35.071
BUSINESS. THE AVERAGE HOLD

01:04:35.137 --> 01:04:36.973
WHICH IS ABOUT RETAIN BY THIS

01:04:37.039 --> 01:04:39.508
THE OPERATORS AFTER PAYING THE

01:04:39.575 --> 01:04:40.076
WING CUSTOMERS IS AROUND 5%

01:04:40.142 --> 01:04:42.545
GIVE OR TAKE. THAT WIN

01:04:42.612 --> 01:04:44.747
PERCENTAGE IS MUCH MUCH LOWER

01:04:44.814 --> 01:04:46.515
THAN YOU'D FIND CASINO GAMES OR

01:04:46.582 --> 01:04:48.517
IMPAIR MUTUAL HORSE RACING.

01:04:48.584 --> 01:04:51.554
MEANWHILE THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT

01:04:51.621 --> 01:04:52.154
EXPENSES AND COMPLEXITIES AND

01:04:52.221 --> 01:04:54.457
OPERATE IN A SPORTS BOOK. SO

01:04:54.523 --> 01:04:55.658
BECAUSE OF THE LOW THE LOW

01:04:55.725 --> 01:04:57.693
MARGINS IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT

01:04:57.760 --> 01:05:00.196
THE TAX RATE BE REASONABLE. BY

01:05:00.263 --> 01:05:02.431
WAY OF EXAMPLE NEVADA WHICH IS

01:05:02.498 --> 01:05:03.866
STILL THE LARGEST SPORTS

01:05:03.933 --> 01:05:05.034
BETTING MARKET IN THE US NEXT

01:05:05.101 --> 01:05:08.170
DOOR- THE TAX RATE IS SIX POINT

01:05:08.237 --> 01:05:11.040
SEVEN FIVE PERCENT- IOWA WHICH

01:05:11.107 --> 01:05:12.008
IS ANOTHER STATE TO LEGALIZE

01:05:12.074 --> 01:05:14.076
SPORTS BETTING LAST YEAR- ALSO

01:05:14.143 --> 01:05:16.912
HAS A SIX POINT 75% TAX. NEW

01:05:16.979 --> 01:05:19.081
JERSEY- THEY SPLIT THE TAX RATE

01:05:19.148 --> 01:05:21.751
IN FOR LAND BASED CASINOS IT'S

01:05:21.817 --> 01:05:24.420
NINE POINT SEVEN FIVE PERCENT-

01:05:24.487 --> 01:05:25.021
AND FOR MOBILE SPORTS MINUTES

01:05:25.087 --> 01:05:28.090
13% THAT'S A DID IN ADDITION TO

01:05:28.157 --> 01:05:28.991
THE COURT APPOINTED PANEL THAT

01:05:29.058 --> 01:05:32.295
WAS DISCUSSED BEFORE- TAX

01:05:32.361 --> 01:05:33.329
FEDERAL EXCISE TAX ON THE

01:05:33.396 --> 01:05:35.164
HANDLE OF THE AMOUNT WAGERED

01:05:35.231 --> 01:05:37.833
WHICH GOES THE IRS. SO REALLY

01:05:37.900 --> 01:05:39.935
ANY MORE TAXES OR FEES OR

01:05:40.002 --> 01:05:41.904
ROYALTIES OR INTEGRITY FEES

01:05:41.971 --> 01:05:42.972
REALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE FROM

01:05:43.039 --> 01:05:45.708
THE OPERATORS TO MOVE- YOU KNOW

01:05:45.775 --> 01:05:47.610
THE CUSTOMERS FROM THE BLACK

01:05:47.677 --> 01:05:48.544
MARKET TO LEGAL MARKET WHICH IS

01:05:48.611 --> 01:05:49.478
REALLY WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO

01:05:49.545 --> 01:05:51.947
HERE. IT IMPAIRS OUR ABILITY TO

01:05:52.014 --> 01:05:53.649
REALLY MARKET THE PRODUCT AND

01:05:53.716 --> 01:05:55.251
REALLY INNOVATE IN PRICE THE

01:05:55.318 --> 01:05:57.253
PRODUCT PEDAL LEE WITH THE WITH

01:05:57.320 --> 01:05:57.787
THE OFFSHORE. AND ILLEGAL

01:05:57.853 --> 01:06:00.523
OPERATORS. WELL TO ME THEY'RE

01:06:00.589 --> 01:06:01.957
REALLY THE TRUE COMPETITION

01:06:02.024 --> 01:06:03.192
WHEN LEGAL SPORTS BETTING COMES

01:06:03.259 --> 01:06:04.727
IN CALIFORNIA. WE KNOW THAT

01:06:04.794 --> 01:06:05.928
SPORTS PAIN HAS BEEN AROUND IN

01:06:05.995 --> 01:06:07.563
NEVADA FOR MANY MANY YEARS IT'S

01:06:07.630 --> 01:06:09.632
LIVE IN OREGON AND IT'S ALIVE

01:06:09.699 --> 01:06:12.101
AND IN MANY OTHER STATES SO FAR.

01:06:12.168 --> 01:06:13.469
AND THE COMPETITION WHICH IS IT

01:06:13.536 --> 01:06:14.804
THESE ILLEGAL BOOKMAKERS THEY

01:06:14.870 --> 01:06:16.505
DON'T ONLY PAY NOTE ANY TAXES

01:06:16.572 --> 01:06:17.506
OR FEES BUT THEY HAVE NO

01:06:17.573 --> 01:06:19.342
COMPLIANCE COSTS. THEY MUST

01:06:19.408 --> 01:06:21.811
FOLLOW ALL- STATE REGULATIONS

01:06:21.877 --> 01:06:23.012
FEDERAL REGULATIONS AND THE

01:06:23.079 --> 01:06:26.449
COST TO COMPLY- IS SUBSTANTIAL

01:06:26.515 --> 01:06:27.049
BEYOND THE TAX RATES IN OTHER

01:06:27.116 --> 01:06:31.587
OPERATING EXPENSES. THE FINAL

01:06:31.654 --> 01:06:32.188
SUBJECT ALL TALK I'LL TOUCH ON

01:06:32.254 --> 01:06:34.990
IS COLLEGE SPORTS. SO IN A VAT

SINCE THE NINETEEN NINETY FIVE-

01:08:05.748 --> 01:08:07.883
UNFORTUNATELY- I FOUND IT RIGHT

01:08:07.950 --> 01:08:09.485
BEFORE WE CAME UP HERE THAT WE

01:08:09.552 --> 01:08:11.086

PROMINENT- THERE WERE SOME TAX

01:08:34.577 --> 01:08:37.079
RATE CHANGES- THAT ALLOWED OR

VERY COMFORTABLE AND THEY KNEW-THAT IT WAS GOING TO BE

01:08:45.321 --> 01:08:47.389
PROFITABLE. AS DAN SAID WE

01:08:47.456 --> 01:08:50.893
HAVE- CURRENTLY IN THE STATE OF

01:08:50.960 --> 01:08:51.427

01:17:46.995 --> 01:17:47.863
KIND OF BREEZED THROUGH A

01:17:47.929 --> 01:17:48.430
LITTLE BIT OF THE BEGINNING

01:17:48.497 --> 01:17:50.999

01:17:51.066 --> 01:17:52.200
FOLKS HAVE COME BEFORE ME OF

01:18:01.143 --> 01:18:02.344
DIFFERENT- I THINK THE

01:18:02.411 --> 01:18:03.745
CALIFORNIA WELL IN A LOT OF

01:18:03.812 --> 01:18:06.782

FRAMEWORK IS ACTUALLY QUITE A

01:18:08.483 --> 01:18:10.352
BIT DIFFERENT AND WHEN VOTERS

01:18:10.419 --> 01:18:12.087
BACK IN THE MID EIGHTIES

01:18:12.154 --> 01:18:14.389

01:18:17.726 --> 01:18:21.830
COMMISSION THAT CAN AUTHORIZE

01:18:28.770 --> 01:18:30.238
HIRED DIRECTOR WHO ACTUALLY

01:18:30.305 --> 01:18:31.106
OVERSEAS THE DAY TO DAY

01:18:31.173 --> 01:18:33.275
OPERATIONS OF THE LOTTERY. THE

01:18:33.341 --> 01:18:34.543
ROLE OF THE LEGISLATURE REALLY

01:18:34.609 --> 01:18:36.812
IS TO- WERE WITHIN CONTRACTUAL

01:18:36.878 --> 01:18:37.712
VOTER SPEND THE MONEY THAT WE

THE YEARS THE LEGISLATURE IN

01:18:44.186 --> 01:18:45.921
OREGON HAS ENACTED STATUTES

01:18:45.987 --> 01:18:47.823
THAT REGULATE MORE OR LESS HOW

01:18:47.889 --> 01:18:49.758
WE DO THINGS. NOT NECESSARILY

01:18:49.825 --> 01:18:52.260
WHAT AND A GREAT EXAMPLE IS-

01:18:52.327 --> 01:18:53.395
THAT LIMITING THE NUMBER OF

01:19:04.439 --> 01:19:06.908
LITTLE BIT MORE QUICKLY- THAN

01:19:06.975 --> 01:19:07.642
SOME OTHER STATES BECAUE WE

01:19:07.709 --> 01:19:09.644
DIDN'T HAVE TO- SEEK A

01:19:09.711 --> 01:19:11.980
CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT OR- OR

01:19:12.047 --> 01:19:13.648
REALLY EVEN LEGISLATION.

01:19:13.715 --> 01:19:14.783
OBVIOUSLY WE DON'T OPERATE IN A

01:19:14.850 --> 01:19:16.985
VACUUM AND WE'VE BEEN WORKING-

01:19:17.052 --> 01:19:18.253
IN COLLABORATION WITH OUR

01:19:18.320 --> 01:19:20.155
LEGISLATURE FOR SOMETIME NOW-

01:19:20.222 --> 01:19:25.227
BUT IT DID SPEED THINGS ALONG.

01:19:25.293 --> 01:19:27.162
LOTTERY HAD A SPORTS GAME- I

01:19:27.229 --> 01:19:28.163
THINK STARTED IN THE LATE

01:19:28.230 --> 01:19:30.465
EIGHTIES- THROUGH THE- THROUGH

01:19:30.532 --> 01:19:31.233
THE NINETIES INTO THE EARLY TWO

01:19:31.299 --> 01:19:34.536
THOUSANDS. IT WAS A- VERY BASIC

01:19:34.603 --> 01:19:36.404
PARLAY GAME THAT WAS AVAILABLE

01:19:36.471 --> 01:19:37.706
CONVENIENCE STORES IN OREGON WE

01:19:37.772 --> 01:19:39.307
HAVE THAT ONE PASS BUT WAS

01:19:39.374 --> 01:19:41.176
FIRST ENACTED. IN SO THAT'S WHY

01:19:41.243 --> 01:19:43.044
OREGON- WAS GRANDFATHERED IN

01:19:43.111 --> 01:19:47.616
THAT SAID. OUR COMMISSION-

01:19:47.682 --> 01:19:51.119
VOTED TO END THAT- THAT PARLAY

01:19:51.186 --> 01:19:52.787
GAME IN THE EARLY TWO THOUSANDS

01:19:52.854 --> 01:19:53.955
PRIMARILY DUE TO PRESSURE FROM

01:19:54.022 --> 01:19:56.725
THE NC DOUBLE A- STATING THAT

01:19:56.791 --> 01:19:57.792
THEY WEREN'T GOING TO AUTHORIZE

01:19:57.859 --> 01:19:59.561
ANY- CHAMPIONSHIP EVENTS IN THE

01:19:59.628 --> 01:20:01.029
STATE THAT HAD. ANY FORMER

01:20:01.096 --> 01:20:02.931
SPORTS BETTING- UNIVERSITY OF

01:20:02.998 --> 01:20:03.532
OREGON WHERE TRACK

01:20:03.598 --> 01:20:05.200
CHAMPIONSHIPS AT HAYWARD- AS

01:20:05.267 --> 01:20:06.168
SHE WAS DOING GREAT WITH

01:20:06.234 --> 01:20:09.171
BASEBALL- WE WANTED TO FILL-

01:20:09.237 --> 01:20:10.805
THE MOTOR CENTER WITH A MARCH

01:20:10.872 --> 01:20:12.908
MADNESS GAMES SO- YOU KNOW OR

01:20:12.974 --> 01:20:14.209
LEGISLATOR WITH LEGISLATURE

01:20:14.276 --> 01:20:16.077
LOOK AT THAT WEIGHING REALLY

01:20:16.144 --> 01:20:17.579
THAT. THE REVENUE THAT THAT

01:20:17.646 --> 01:20:19.014
PARTICULAR GAME WAS BRING IN

01:20:19.080 --> 01:20:20.448
WITH THE POTENTIAL LOSSES OF

01:20:20.515 --> 01:20:22.350
THOSE GAMES AND WE MADE THAT

01:20:22.417 --> 01:20:23.451
DECISION OBVIOUSLY THE WORLD

01:20:23.518 --> 01:20:26.254
HAS CHANGED SINCE THEN- AND-

01:20:26.321 --> 01:20:27.756
AND SO WE DECIDED TO BRING IT

01:20:27.822 --> 01:20:29.224
BACK BUT JUST BECAUSE WE CAN'T

01:20:29.291 --> 01:20:30.926
DO SOMETHING- IT DOESN'T MEAN

01:20:30.992 --> 01:20:32.227
WE NECESSARILY SHOWED SO WE

01:20:32.294 --> 01:20:34.129
REALLY TOOK A STEP BACK. AND

01:20:34.196 --> 01:20:35.163
REALLY THOUGHT ABOUT WHAT'S THE

01:20:35.230 --> 01:20:38.133
BUSINESS CASE- TO DO THIS AND A

01:20:38.200 --> 01:20:40.769

IN GAMBLING IN GENERAL BUT

01:20:44.472 --> 01:20:47.275
ALSO- IN RELATION TO MOBILE-

01:20:47.342 --> 01:20:48.543
WHAT THE CONVENIENCE

01:20:48.610 --> 01:20:50.145
EXPECTATIONS ARE. FOR US WHEN

01:20:50.212 --> 01:20:52.814

01:21:01.356 --> 01:21:03.358
OF OUR POPULATION. BUT NOT ALL

01:21:03.425 --> 01:21:04.926
AND SO WHEN WE LOOKED AT-

01:21:04.993 --> 01:21:07.362

CURRENT PLAYERS TO PLAYER WHICH

01:21:27.282 --> 01:21:29.184

INCREMENTAL SALE IT IS A NEW

01:21:36.491 --> 01:21:38.827
LEVEL OF EXCITEMENT- AS SOON AS

01:21:38.893 --> 01:21:39.828
POSSIBLE WAS OVERTURNED WE WERE

01:21:39.894 --> 01:21:41.162
GETTING CALLS AND EMAILS ABOUT

BACK SPORTS ACTION THAT WAS THE

01:21:45.567 --> 01:21:46.101
OLD GAME THAT WE USED TO HAVE

01:21:46.167 --> 01:21:49.571
AND- JUST DALY. A CALL SO WE

01:21:49.638 --> 01:21:50.538
KNEW THERE WAS A LOT OF

01:21:50.605 --> 01:21:52.274
EXCITEMENT WE KNEW THAT ILLEGAL

01:21:52.340 --> 01:21:54.209
BETTING ON A MOBILE PLATFORMS

01:21:54.276 --> 01:21:56.611
WAS ALREADY OCCURRING- IN IN

01:21:56.678 --> 01:21:59.114
THE STATE AND SO THAT'S WHY WE

01:21:59.180 --> 01:21:59.848
MADE THE DECISION TO GO

01:21:59.914 --> 01:22:02.550
FORWARD- SO ORGAN LOTTERY

01:22:02.617 --> 01:22:05.220
SCOREBOARD- WE LAUNCHED IN MID

01:22:05.287 --> 01:22:07.622
OCTOBER- THERE WERE SOME POLICY

01:22:07.689 --> 01:22:09.224
CHOICES THAT WE- THAT ARE

01:22:09.291 --> 01:22:11.192
COMMISSION MADE- THAT I THINK

01:22:11.259 --> 01:22:12.527
ANYONE'S GONNA HAVE TO WRESTLE

01:22:12.594 --> 01:22:14.963
WITH WE MADE THE CHOICE TO.

01:22:15.030 --> 01:22:16.665
LIMIT IT TO AGES TO PLAYERS-

01:22:16.731 --> 01:22:18.833
TWENTY ONE AND OLDER- FOR US-

01:22:18.900 --> 01:22:20.101
IT'S THE FIRST FORAY INTO

01:22:20.168 --> 01:22:21.336
ACCOUNT BASED PLAY THROUGH THE

01:22:21.403 --> 01:22:23.505
MOBILE PLATFORM SO WHAT THAT

01:22:23.571 --> 01:22:24.639
MEANS IS FOR THE FIRST TIME WE

01:22:24.706 --> 01:22:26.308
REALLY KNOW WHO'S PLAYING OUR

01:22:26.374 --> 01:22:28.677
GAMES- WE OBVIOUSLY KNOW WHO

01:22:28.743 --> 01:22:29.978
WINS OUR GAMES WHEN THEY COME

01:22:30.045 --> 01:22:31.746
IN- FOR THE LARGE TAXABLE

01:22:31.813 --> 01:22:33.448
PRICES WHEN THEY CASH THEM BUT

01:22:33.515 --> 01:22:36.351
NOW WE HAVE INSIGHT INTO- A

01:22:36.418 --> 01:22:38.887
PLAYER'S ENTIRE PLAYER HISTORY-

01:22:38.953 --> 01:22:41.456
THAT'S ACTUALLY VERY BENEFICIAL

01:22:41.523 --> 01:22:44.192
FOR SOME RESPONSIBLE GAMING AND

01:22:44.259 --> 01:22:45.026
GAMBLING A PROBLEM GAMBLING-

01:22:45.093 --> 01:22:47.495
ISSUES WE CAN ACTUALLY SPOT-

01:22:47.562 --> 01:22:49.497
HIGH RISK PLAYERS- BUT ALSO. IT

01:22:49.564 --> 01:22:52.734
POSE SOME REAL- POLICY-

01:22:52.801 --> 01:22:54.202
DISCUSSIONS FORCED TO JUST

01:22:54.269 --> 01:22:56.604
AROUND A PUBLIC RECORDS AND IS

01:22:56.671 --> 01:22:59.341
THAT DATA AVAILABLE WE'RE A

01:22:59.407 --> 01:23:01.009
PUBLIC AGENCY WE HAVE THIS

01:23:01.076 --> 01:23:03.745
DATA- WE DON'T THINK THAT AN

01:23:03.812 --> 01:23:05.447
INDIVIDUAL'S PROPER HISTORY IS

01:23:05.513 --> 01:23:07.716
PUBLIC DATA ARE RELEASABLE DATE

01:23:07.782 --> 01:23:08.983
OBVIOUSLY TAX BILL WTH SPRINT

01:23:09.050 --> 01:23:15.023
STORY BUT- YEAH SO THOSE ARE

01:23:15.090 --> 01:23:15.657

OCCUR OPERATE IN A VACUUM-

BOOKS SENATE MADE FOR. IN

01:26:04.492 --> 01:26:10.064
CONVERSATION. IT ALSO IS NOT

01:26:10.131 --> 01:26:11.132
MANDATE BUT IT'S ALL IT IT'S IT

01:26:11.199 --> 01:26:12.400

THEIR DEPOSIT LIMIT IF THEY CAN

01:26:14.836 --> 01:26:15.436
SET A LOS LIMIT SO THAT IF THEY

01:26:15.503 --> 01:26:16.337

01:26:16.404 --> 01:26:16.905
LOST EX NUMBER OF DOLLARS A

MONTH IT TIMES THEM OUT AGAIN

01:26:18.006 --> 01:26:19.741
THAT'S AN OPTIONAL FEATURE BUT

01:26:19.807 --> 01:26:20.341
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT

01:26:20.408 --> 01:26:22.243
WAS A TOOL THAT WAS AVAILABLE-

01:26:22.310 --> 01:26:25.013
ANOTHER ONE IS A SELF SELF SELF

01:26:25.079 --> 01:26:27.315
ASSESSMENT QUIZ. THAT PLAYERS

01:26:27.382 --> 01:26:29.851
CAN TAKE AGAIN MOBILE PHONE

VERY EASY TO DO- AND AGAIN THIS

01:26:32.987 --> 01:26:34.689
KIND OF THE TREND YOU'RE SEEING

01:26:34.756 --> 01:26:36.591
HERE IS THAT WE FEEL LIKE THE

01:26:36.658 --> 01:26:37.158
PLAYERS THAT MORE INFORMED

01:26:37.225 --> 01:26:39.160
PLAYERS MAKE BETTER MORE

01:26:39.227 --> 01:26:40.828
RESPONSIBLE DECISIONS AND SO

01:26:40.895 --> 01:26:42.797
REALLY THOSE FOR THOSE FIRST

01:26:42.864 --> 01:26:43.965
FEW BULLETS ARE ALL ABOUT

01:26:44.032 --> 01:26:44.666
GIVING PLAYERS AS MUCH

01:26:44.732 --> 01:26:46.901
INFORMATION AS WE CAN. WE ALSO

01:26:46.968 --> 01:26:48.703
KNOW THAT EVEN WITH ALL THOSE

01:26:48.770 --> 01:26:50.838
TOOLS IT MIGHT BE TOO MUCH FOR

01:26:50.905 --> 01:26:53.741
SOME PEOPLE AND WE OFFER A

01:26:53.808 --> 01:26:57.111
VOLUNTARY TIMEOUTS WHICH ARE

01:26:57.178 --> 01:26:59.280
JUST JUST THAT IT'S A TIME OUT

01:26:59.347 --> 01:27:01.282
IT COULD BE FOR A DAY A WEEK UP

01:27:01.349 --> 01:27:03.985
TO A MONTH. TO A MONTH BEYOND A

01:27:04.052 --> 01:27:04.586
MONTH YOU START GETTING INTO

01:27:04.652 --> 01:27:06.254
WHAT WE CALL SELF EXCLUSION AND

01:27:06.321 --> 01:27:08.856
SELF EXCLUSION CAN UP CAN BE UP

01:27:08.923 --> 01:27:11.092
FOR EVER IF YOU GET TO A PLACE

01:27:11.159 --> 01:27:14.996
WHERE AS A PLAYER YOU FEEL LIKE

01:27:15.063 --> 01:27:16.598
YOU JUST CAN'T HANDLE HAVING

01:27:16.664 --> 01:27:18.800
ACCESS TO THIS CAN TURN IT OFF

01:27:18.866 --> 01:27:21.235
IT'S NOT. BECAUSE WE HAVE SO

01:27:21.302 --> 01:27:25.206

DIFFERENT EMAIL ADDRESS IT'S

01:27:40.021 --> 01:27:44.125

01:28:40.648 --> 01:28:42.150
BIT DIFFERENT REVENUE STRUCTURE

01:28:42.216 --> 01:28:45.119
BECAUSE WE- THAT THAT GROSS

01:28:45.186 --> 01:28:46.354
GAMING REVENUE WE GET A CUT OF

01:28:46.421 --> 01:28:49.757

01:28:49.824 --> 01:28:52.093
PROFIT AT THE END OF THE DAY SO.

01:28:52.160 --> 01:28:54.595

CONTRIBUTED- TO- ACTUALLY MORE

01:29:02.970 --> 01:29:04.806

01:29:04.872 --> 01:29:06.007
THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS I AM

01:29:06.074 --> 01:29:07.842
BECAUSE IT'S MOBILE- AND

01:29:07.909 --> 01:29:10.812

OVERPAYMENT SO AGAIN ALL THAT

01:29:23.091 --> 01:29:24.125
HAPPENS IN REAL TIME BECAUSE

01:29:24.192 --> 01:29:28.329

01:30:22.817 --> 01:30:23.317
OUR BASE AND ALLOW FOR SOME

LESSONS WE'VE LEARNED IN THE

AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE- PAR

01:31:27.448 --> 01:31:30.384
BIGGEST COMPETITION- THERE ARE

01:31:30.451 --> 01:31:31.886
JUST SOME. SOME THINGS THAT

01:31:31.953 --> 01:31:33.187
THEY CAN OFFER THAT THAT WE

01:31:33.254 --> 01:31:35.590
CAN'T. BUT THERE ARE SOME

01:31:35.656 --> 01:31:37.658
THINGS THAT WE CAN OFFER THAT

01:31:37.725 --> 01:31:38.759
THEY CANNOT. OF PEOPLE LIKE THE

01:31:38.826 --> 01:31:41.395
FACT. THAT WHEN THERE'S AN

01:31:41.462 --> 01:31:43.164
ISSUE IF THERE'S AN ISSUE.

01:31:43.231 --> 01:31:44.765
THERE TALKING TO A REAL PERSON

01:31:51.839 --> 01:31:53.441
THEY DON'T GET PAID A BIT COIN

01:31:53.507 --> 01:31:54.942
THEY GET PAID IN REAL DOLLARS

01:31:55.009 --> 01:31:55.743
THAT GO BACK INTO THEIR

01:31:55.810 --> 01:31:59.080
ACCOUNT. IT'S MUCH MORE OF MORE

01:31:59.146 --> 01:32:00.081
THERE'S MUCH LESS FRICTION IN

01:32:00.147 --> 01:32:03.951
THAT FINANCIAL TRANSACTION. AND

01:32:04.018 --> 01:32:04.552

AND PEOPLE KNOW THAT. EVEN IF

01:32:18.499 --> 01:32:21.569
THEY DON'T WIN. THE BET. ORIGIN

01:32:21.636 --> 01:32:22.803
IS WINNING BECAUSE OREGON IS

01:32:22.870 --> 01:32:23.938
THE HOUSE WE ARE THE OPERATOR

01:32:24.005 --> 01:32:25.773

AGAIN SOME OF THE THINGS. THAT

01:32:33.114 --> 01:32:33.915
WE DIDN'T NECESSARILY THINK

01:32:33.981 --> 01:32:35.383
ABOUT THAT WE LEARNED ALONG THE

01:32:35.449 --> 01:32:37.752

THAT WAS HUGE FOR US. WAS THAT

01:32:43.357 --> 01:32:44.458
BANKING LAWS IN OREGON

01:32:44.525 --> 01:32:46.694
PREVENTED US FROM HOPING.

01:32:46.761 --> 01:32:48.663
PEOPLE'S MONEY IN TRUST. IF WE

01:32:48.729 --> 01:32:51.399
WERE A PRIVATE OPERATOR IF WE

01:32:51.465 --> 01:32:52.466
JUST GIVE SOMEONE A LICENSE.

01:32:52.533 --> 01:32:53.601
THERE AN OPERATOR SOMEONE

01:32:53.668 --> 01:32:56.938

LAUNDERING IN WHATEVER IT IS GO

01:40:21.749 --> 01:40:22.282
THROUGH OUR SYSTEM AND SO THE

01:40:22.349 --> 01:40:24.485
FIRST. YOU KNOW THAT THE FIRST

01:40:24.551 --> 01:40:24.985
RESPONSIBILITIES TO OUR

01:40:25.052 --> 01:40:26.286
REGULATOR AND THEN TWO AND THEN

01:40:26.353 --> 01:40:27.888
THAT REGULATOR WILL DO WITH THE

01:40:27.955 --> 01:40:28.756

01:40:28.822 --> 01:40:29.623

WHATEVER THAT THE NEXT

01:40:33.427 --> 01:40:37.331
APPROPRIATE MEASURE MIGHT BE.

01:40:37.398 --> 01:40:42.236
I'LL ADD TO THAT AND. WE

01:40:42.302 --> 01:40:44.071
ACTUALLY HAVE SOME CONTROL

01:40:44.138 --> 01:40:45.672

THOSE TYPE OF TRANSACTIONS

01:41:19.339 --> 01:41:22.042
REALLY JUST DON'T TAKE PLACE.

SO WE CAN TRACK. THAT TYPE OF

01:41:52.473 --> 01:41:54.341

ENGAGED IN THAT. AND HOW WE

01:53:42.515 --> 01:53:44.617
THINK- THE PROSPECTS OF THAT

01:53:44.684 --> 01:53:48.121
WOULD BE FOR CALIFORNIA. AS FAR

01:53:48.188 --> 01:53:49.088
AS A SUCCESSFUL MARKET BUT NOT

01:53:56.863 --> 01:53:57.964
THE AMOUNT THAT FOR US IT'S

01:53:58.031 --> 01:54:00.099
ABOUT 40% IS BAD IN GAME OR

01:54:00.166 --> 01:54:01.935
AFTER THE START OF THE MATCH.

01:54:02.001 --> 01:54:05.838
BY 40% AND GROWING OF COURSE-

MOBILE OFFERING BUT IT IS A

01:54:17.617 --> 01:54:20.220
HIGH GROWTH AREA- TOUGH FOR US

IN EUROPE YOU MIGHT SEE AS A

01:54:22.255 --> 01:54:23.990
PERCENTAGE OF OUR BUSINESS IN

01:54:24.057 --> 01:54:25.892
PLAY OVER 50% WELL OVER FIFTY

01:54:25.959 --> 01:54:28.194
PERCENT. SPECIAL ON SOME SPORTS

PRIMARILY WHAT PEOPLE ARE DOING

01:54:49.082 --> 01:54:50.383
WITHIN IS THERE PAIN ON THE

01:54:50.450 --> 01:54:51.985
OUTCOME OF THE GAME. OR MATCH

AT SOME POINT DURING THE GAME

01:54:54.020 --> 01:54:56.589
SO YOU KNOW I CAN JUMP IN IN

01:54:56.656 --> 01:55:00.360

PLATFORM- THAT IT WILL BE A

01:57:08.888 --> 01:57:12.358
SIGNIFICANT. COMPONENT. SUSAN

02:02:54.233 --> 02:02:55.601
COME AT IT FROM A VARIETY OF

02:02:55.668 --> 02:02:57.603
PERSPECTIVES AND I THINK. A

02:02:57.670 --> 02:02:58.304
COUPLE OF THINGS THAT ARE

02:02:58.370 --> 02:02:59.672
IMPORTANT TO TALK ABOUT IN A-

02:02:59.739 --> 02:03:01.607
MORE BROAD. CONTEXTUALIZE

02:03:01.674 --> 02:03:03.209
EXAMPLE THAT A LOT OF THE GUYS

02:03:03.275 --> 02:03:05.745
IF IT ON ALREADY. AVAILABILITY

02:03:05.811 --> 02:03:07.046
BEING FIRST AND FOREMOST IN MY

02:03:07.113 --> 02:03:12.551
OPINION. THE WAGERING I KNOW

02:03:12.618 --> 02:03:13.185
IT'S BEEN A HOT BUTTON TOPIC IN

02:03:13.252 --> 02:03:13.753
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE REVENUE

02:03:13.819 --> 02:03:15.654
THE- STATE'S. SELENA SEEN

02:03:15.721 --> 02:03:16.222
TREMENDOUS SUCCESS WITH MORE

02:03:16.288 --> 02:03:17.223
THAN 80% OF THE BATS THAT WAY.

02:03:17.289 --> 02:03:17.656
LOOK AT A STATE LIKE

02:03:17.723 --> 02:03:18.324
MISSISSIPPI THAT'S ALWAYS GONNA

02:03:18.390 --> 02:03:19.759
LAG BEHIND. BECAUSE THE MOBILE

02:03:19.825 --> 02:03:21.293
PLATFORM ISN'T SOMETHING THAT

02:03:21.360 --> 02:03:22.828
THEY FOUND. THAT NEEDED TO BE

02:03:22.895 --> 02:03:24.029
INCLUDED IN THEIR INITIAL

02:03:24.096 --> 02:03:26.265
GAMBLING BUILT. ON TAX RATE-

02:03:26.332 --> 02:03:29.068
pOF TIMES AS WELL FROM THE

02:03:29.135 --> 02:03:30.836
STATE'S PERSPECTIVE. I'LL BUT

02:03:30.903 --> 02:03:31.470
THERE'S ALSO FROM THE PLAYER'S

02:03:31.537 --> 02:03:32.638
PERSPECTIVE AS WELL BECAUSE AS

02:03:32.705 --> 02:03:34.540
YOU. FLAYED THE TAX RATE. THE

02:03:34.607 --> 02:03:35.808
PLAYERS TYPICALLY THE ONE THAT

02:03:35.875 --> 02:03:36.776
SUFFERS AND WE'VE SEEN THAT IN

02:03:36.842 --> 02:03:38.010
PENNSYLVANIA OR CERTAIN

02:03:38.077 --> 02:03:40.179
OPERATORS. ARE CHARGING OUT

02:03:40.246 --> 02:03:41.280
JUICER VIGOROUS BASICALLY THE

02:03:41.347 --> 02:03:43.549
TAX ON EVERY BAT. NOT

02:03:43.616 --> 02:03:44.984
CONSISTENT WITH THE NEVADA

02:03:45.050 --> 02:03:46.919
MODEL BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO HEAR

02:03:46.986 --> 02:03:49.288
THAT 36% TAX RATE. AND AS A

02:03:49.355 --> 02:03:50.256
RESULT COSTS ARE GOING TO HAVE

02:03:50.322 --> 02:03:50.790
TO ROLL DOWN HILL AND- THE

02:03:50.856 --> 02:03:51.657
PLAYER. THAT ULTIMATELY

02:03:51.724 --> 02:03:52.992
SUFFERS. AND CAN CREATE A VERY

02:03:53.058 --> 02:03:54.059
DIFFERENT BETTING MARKET AS A

02:03:54.126 --> 02:03:56.629
RESULT- SPORTS INCLUDED WE'VE

02:03:56.695 --> 02:03:58.097
SEEN A LOT OF THE MODELS AND I

02:03:58.164 --> 02:03:59.698
KNOW MATT SPOKE- ELOQUENTLY

02:03:59.765 --> 02:04:01.867
ABOUT ORGAN. IN THE STATE OF

02:04:01.934 --> 02:04:03.836
CALIFORNIA IF YOU WERE TO GO TO

02:04:03.903 --> 02:04:06.372
A BUSINESS MODEL AND EXCLUDE.

02:04:06.438 --> 02:04:09.008
ALL THE COLLEGIATE TEAMS I

02:04:09.074 --> 02:04:09.608
THINK IT TAKES AWAY A MASK. ON

02:04:09.675 --> 02:04:12.178
A- AS IT PERTAINS TO WHETHER

02:04:12.244 --> 02:04:13.312
IT'S BESSIE UCLA. OR ALL THE

02:04:13.379 --> 02:04:14.146
BIG WEST FANS THAT ARE OUT

02:04:14.213 --> 02:04:14.713
THERE THAT WANT TO SWEAR UC

02:04:14.780 --> 02:04:15.281
RIVERSIDE BAD ON A THURSDAY

02:04:15.347 --> 02:04:16.081
NIGHT. TO TRY AND FIND SOME

02:04:16.148 --> 02:04:17.616
LEVEL OF FAN ENGAGEMENT WITH

02:04:17.683 --> 02:04:19.418
THAT. ARE YOU LOOKING NEVADA.

02:04:19.485 --> 02:04:21.020
U. N. L. V. NEVADA AS JAY

02:04:21.086 --> 02:04:22.788
TALKED ABOUT WERE INCORPORATED

02:04:22.855 --> 02:04:24.356
INTO THE GAMING LOG IS AN

02:04:24.423 --> 02:04:25.624
OPPORTUNITY TO TRY AND BACK.

02:04:25.691 --> 02:04:26.892
BUT I THINK WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING

02:04:26.959 --> 02:04:28.027
TO EXPAND THE MENU AND TAKE

02:04:28.093 --> 02:04:29.261
CUSTOMERS THAT HAVE GROWN

02:04:29.328 --> 02:04:30.396
ACCUSTOMED TO PLAYING IN THOSE.

02:04:30.462 --> 02:04:31.831
AGAIN REGULATED MARKETS. IT'S

02:04:31.897 --> 02:04:33.299
IMPORTANT TO GIVE THEM THAT

02:04:33.365 --> 02:04:35.201
FULL EXPANSIVE MENU. TO INCLUDE

02:04:35.267 --> 02:04:37.069
ALL THE COLLEGE TEAMS ALL THE

02:04:37.136 --> 02:04:38.537
PROFESSIONAL TEAMS. AND GIVE

02:04:38.604 --> 02:04:40.005
THEM EVERY INCENTIVE TO TAKE

02:04:40.072 --> 02:04:41.273
THEIR MONEY FROM THAT ON

02:04:41.340 --> 02:04:42.675
REGULATED JURISDICTION WHETHER

02:04:42.741 --> 02:04:44.143
IT'S A CORNER BOOKMAKER. WERE

02:04:44.210 --> 02:04:46.879
OFF SHORE AND BRING IT INTO A

02:04:46.946 --> 02:04:47.680
MORE TRANSPARENT MARKET.

02:04:47.746 --> 02:04:49.648
BECAUSE WE LIKE TO SAY ALL THE

02:04:49.715 --> 02:04:51.951
TIME THE BEST DISINFECTANT IS

02:04:52.017 --> 02:04:54.587
ALWAYS GONNA BE TRANSPARENCY

02:04:54.653 --> 02:04:55.721
SHINING A BRIGHT LIGHT. ON

02:04:55.788 --> 02:04:56.689
THOSE PARTICULAR ROUTE- WAGER

02:04:56.755 --> 02:04:58.224
TYPES. I KNOW WE TALKED A

02:04:58.290 --> 02:04:59.058
LITTLE BIT ABOUT OUT. ONLINE

02:04:59.124 --> 02:04:59.892
ALEX USED IN RUNNING WITH

02:04:59.959 --> 02:05:01.260
DURING. AS A POTENTIAL I THINK

02:05:01.327 --> 02:05:03.696
CERTAIN EUROPEAN SPORTS LET

02:05:03.762 --> 02:05:06.131
SELVES MUCH BETTER TO THAT TYPE

02:05:06.198 --> 02:05:06.699
OF WAGERING AMERICAN SPORTS.

02:05:06.765 --> 02:05:07.733
BUT AS THE IMAGE. AND SPOKE

02:05:07.800 --> 02:05:09.101
BETTER FEELS MORE COMFORTABLE I

02:05:09.168 --> 02:05:10.502
THINK THAT IS A MASSIVE GROWTH

02:05:10.569 --> 02:05:11.770
POTENTIAL. AND IT'S SOMETHING

02:05:11.837 --> 02:05:14.073
AGAIN THE ONLY LENDS ITSELF TO

02:05:14.139 --> 02:05:15.507
A MOBILE PLATFORM. MORE SO THAN

02:05:15.574 --> 02:05:17.109
A BRICK AND MORTAR. IF THE

02:05:17.176 --> 02:05:18.611
COLLECTIVITY OF WALKING UP TO A

02:05:18.677 --> 02:05:20.679
KIOSK FOR CONSTANTLY CHANGING

02:05:20.746 --> 02:05:22.248
ODDS. JUST NOT A REALISTIC

02:05:22.314 --> 02:05:24.783
POSSIBILITY- IN MY ESTIMATION.

02:05:24.850 --> 02:05:25.417
AND THEN WHEN YOU LOOK AT THEM.

02:05:25.484 --> 02:05:26.685
IT'S OH BY THINK STANDARDIZED

02:05:26.752 --> 02:05:27.887
TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM. SOME OF

02:05:27.953 --> 02:05:29.655
THE ISSUES THAT TO RUN INTO YOU

02:05:29.722 --> 02:05:30.789
ARE A LOT OF LIQUIDITY IF EVERY

02:05:30.856 --> 02:05:32.424
STATE OPERATES IN ITS OWN

02:05:32.491 --> 02:05:34.727
VACUUM. DECIDES IT ONLY WANTS

02:05:34.793 --> 02:05:36.295
TO IDENTIFY CERTAIN OPERATE.

02:05:36.362 --> 02:05:37.663
IT'S GOING TO PRECLUDE YOU FROM

02:05:37.730 --> 02:05:39.398
TAKING BUT THE BIGGER BATS THAT

02:05:39.465 --> 02:05:41.934
MIGHT BE OUT THERE SO. THE

02:05:42.001 --> 02:05:44.036
RESULT YOU'RE TAKING SMALLER

02:05:44.103 --> 02:05:47.239
MARTINS. AND YOU'RE- GONNA HAVE

02:05:47.306 --> 02:05:49.909
THIS IN. THE BACK AND ALL THAT

02:05:49.975 --> 02:05:51.610
YOU OTHERWISE. IT IS BASED ON

02:05:51.677 --> 02:05:54.113
SOME OF THE BIGGEST NAMES. I

02:05:54.179 --> 02:05:55.981
THINK WE'LL TALK ABOUT ALL

02:05:56.048 --> 02:05:58.284
LOCAL PAYS MARKETING PAM SHOULD

02:05:58.350 --> 02:05:59.685
PROVIDE. PERFECT AMPLE

02:05:59.752 --> 02:06:01.220
ILLUSTRATION. ARE THEY WANT

02:06:01.287 --> 02:06:01.954
FIVE IS. BETTING

02:06:02.021 --> 02:06:06.125
INTERCOLLEGIATE. THEY HAD THREE

02:06:06.191 --> 02:06:08.961
POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS WE

02:06:09.028 --> 02:06:15.100
JUST IN JUST THE FIRST. SPEAK

02:06:15.167 --> 02:06:15.935
TO THE STRENGTH AND HOW

02:06:16.001 --> 02:06:17.503
IMPORTANT IS TO HAVE THAT

02:06:17.569 --> 02:06:18.570
LOCALIZED COMPONENT TO IT.

02:06:18.637 --> 02:06:20.205
BECAUSE FANS ARE ALWAYS LOOKING

02:06:20.272 --> 02:06:20.973
FOR THAT EXTRA WAY TO GET

02:06:21.040 --> 02:06:22.608
INVOLVED. WHETHER IT'S A FIVE

02:06:22.675 --> 02:06:24.176
DOLLAR BET PRE MATCH WHETHER TO

02:06:24.243 --> 02:06:25.811
TEN DOLLAR BET AT THE HALFTIME.

02:06:25.878 --> 02:06:27.379
THEY'RE TRYING TO FIND A UNIQUE

02:06:27.446 --> 02:06:28.380
WAY. TO HAVE THAT DIFFERENT

02:06:28.447 --> 02:06:30.582
CONNECTION TO THEIR TEAM- ONE

02:06:30.649 --> 02:06:32.184
THING THAT I WILL SAY FROM THE

02:06:32.251 --> 02:06:33.052
BETTER PERSPECTIVE HAVING DEALT

02:06:33.118 --> 02:06:34.520
WITH THE FIRST HAND IS ALWAYS A

02:06:34.586 --> 02:06:35.888
RESPONSIBLE GAMING COMPONENT.

02:06:35.955 --> 02:06:37.156
WHEN YOU'RE IN A REGULATED

02:06:37.222 --> 02:06:38.657
MARKET YOU CAN SET ASIDE

02:06:38.724 --> 02:06:40.392
RESOURCES TO TRY AND TAKE CARE

02:06:40.459 --> 02:06:41.527
OF PEOPLE THAT SMALL SEGMENT OF

02:06:41.593 --> 02:06:43.195
POPULATION. THAT LET'S NOT SURE

02:06:43.262 --> 02:06:44.563
CODE INEVITABLY ARE GOING TO

02:06:44.630 --> 02:06:46.699
HAVE PROBLEMS. WITH SPORTS

02:06:46.765 --> 02:06:48.167
BETTING WHICH CAN BE A VERY

02:06:48.233 --> 02:06:50.269
ADDICTIVE. PURSUIT THE SAME YOU

02:06:50.336 --> 02:06:51.837
HAVE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES IN

02:06:51.904 --> 02:06:53.372
PLACE. FOR ALCOHOL OR OTHER

02:06:53.439 --> 02:06:54.506
SUBSTANCES THAT ARE HIGHLY

02:06:54.573 --> 02:06:56.809
MONITORED HIGHLY REGULATED. YOU

02:06:56.875 --> 02:06:58.510
DON'T GET THAT IN THE OFFSHORE

02:06:58.577 --> 02:07:00.012
MARKET. YOU CAN CONSISTENTLY

02:07:00.079 --> 02:07:01.013
HAVE PEOPLE GETTING THEMSELVES

02:07:01.080 --> 02:07:02.481
INTO TROUBLE. SOME OF THE OTHER

02:07:02.548 --> 02:07:03.549
CIRCUMSTANCES THAT

02:07:03.615 --> 02:07:05.184
UNFORTUNATELY. ALL COME WITH

02:07:05.250 --> 02:07:05.918
THAT WHEN YOU GO IN ON A

02:07:05.985 --> 02:07:08.354
DELAYED BASIS. I'M WHEN YOU

02:07:08.420 --> 02:07:09.822
LOOK AT SOME OF THE OTHER

02:07:09.888 --> 02:07:12.124
THINGS THAT ARE OUT THERE. ONE

02:07:12.191 --> 02:07:15.928
OF THE REASONS OFTEN IGNORED.

02:07:15.995 --> 02:07:18.230
IN THE SPORTS BETTING SPACE WE

02:07:18.297 --> 02:07:19.932
SPEND SO MUCH TIME TALKING

02:07:19.999 --> 02:07:22.134
ABOUT. OPERATE DANCE THE AREAS

02:07:22.201 --> 02:07:25.004
THAT ARE OUT THERE. DOING A-

02:07:25.070 --> 02:07:32.211
DROP WHEN MY- DOES MY- IN. COME

02:07:32.277 --> 02:07:33.812
THEIR PORCH THE TWO AREAS DAVE.

02:07:33.879 --> 02:07:34.380
WE ARE THEIR MAIN AREAS OF

02:07:34.446 --> 02:07:34.880
CONCERN ARE EASY TO USE

02:07:34.947 --> 02:07:35.481
INTERFACES WHICH AUTOMATICALLY

02:07:35.547 --> 02:07:36.448
IMPLIES THAT THEY'RE THINKING

02:07:36.515 --> 02:07:37.049
OF SPORTS BETTING COMING TO

02:07:37.116 --> 02:07:37.683
THEIR STATE MOBILE PLATFORM NOT

02:07:37.750 --> 02:07:38.317
THE TRADITIONAL WAY OF WALKING

02:07:38.384 --> 02:07:39.251
UP TO THE COUNTER PLACING YOUR

02:07:39.318 --> 02:07:39.885
WAGER GOING BACK TO YOUR SEAT

02:07:39.952 --> 02:07:40.419
WHAT HAVE YOU I AND MORE

02:07:40.486 --> 02:07:41.420
IMPORTANTLY COMPETITIVE PRICING

02:07:41.487 --> 02:07:42.021
AND I THINK AS WE SEE SOME OF

02:07:42.087 --> 02:07:42.988
THESE VERY STATES THEY COME

02:07:43.055 --> 02:07:45.024
ONLINE YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THE

02:07:45.090 --> 02:07:46.792
NUMBERS THAT ARE OUT THERE. AND

02:07:46.859 --> 02:07:48.594
WHILE ME WILL CAN NOW CHARGING

02:07:48.660 --> 02:07:50.295
A PRICE ABOVE THE- AVERAGE THAT

02:07:50.362 --> 02:07:52.197
CUSTOMERS ARE GONNA GET SMARTER

02:07:52.264 --> 02:07:52.798
AND THEY'RE GOING TO TRY AND

02:07:52.865 --> 02:07:54.299
PUSH BACK A LITTLE BIT AND GO

02:07:54.366 --> 02:07:56.335
WELL WAIT A SECOND IF YOU'RE

02:07:56.402 --> 02:07:57.936
GONNA CHARGE ME TAXES ON ALL OF

02:07:58.003 --> 02:07:59.238
THIS STUFF THAT'S OUT THERE I'M

02:07:59.304 --> 02:08:00.706
GONNA GET YOU TO GO TO THE ON

02:08:00.773 --> 02:08:02.608
REGULATED OKAY I'M GONNA TAKE

02:08:02.674 --> 02:08:04.543
ADVANTAGE OF CREDIT BECAUSE

02:08:04.610 --> 02:08:05.944
IT'S A LOT EASIER TO DO THAT.

02:08:06.011 --> 02:08:06.578
IT'S A SENSE BUT THIS WAS BUILT

02:08:06.645 --> 02:08:08.514
ON WITH CREDIT CARDS AND HOUSE

02:08:08.580 --> 02:08:10.649
IT'S A VERY SIMILAR MINDSET

02:08:10.716 --> 02:08:11.150
SPORTS BETTORS ARE GONNA

02:08:11.216 --> 02:08:13.385
UTILIZED. AT THE SAME TIME. SO

02:08:13.452 --> 02:08:13.986
ONE OF THE BIGGEST THINGS FOR

02:08:14.053 --> 02:08:15.187
ME AS WELL AS A SPORTS. IS THIS

02:08:15.254 --> 02:08:16.789
MARKET IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT

02:08:16.855 --> 02:08:17.956
THAN ANYTHING ELSE THAT'S OUT

02:08:18.023 --> 02:08:19.024
THERE WHEN YOU WALK INTO A

02:08:19.091 --> 02:08:20.359
BRICK AND MORTAR CASINO. YOU

02:08:20.426 --> 02:08:21.927
SEE LIMITS CLEARLY POSTED ON

02:08:21.994 --> 02:08:23.228
THE TABLE IF YOU WALK UP TO A

02:08:23.295 --> 02:08:24.897
BLACKJACK TABLE. FIVE DOLLARS

02:08:24.963 --> 02:08:25.697
COULD BE OUR MINIMUM BAT

02:08:25.764 --> 02:08:27.099
UPWARDS OF TWO THOUSAND WHAT

02:08:27.166 --> 02:08:29.034
HAVE YOU. SPORTS BETTING IN MY

02:08:29.101 --> 02:08:30.302
OPINION IT'S KIND OF BEEN IN

02:08:30.369 --> 02:08:30.936
THAT GRAY AREA EVEN IN

02:08:31.003 --> 02:08:33.072
REGULATED MARKETS. AND IS A

02:08:33.138 --> 02:08:33.739
BETTER MYSELF I'D LOVE TO SEE A

02:08:33.806 --> 02:08:35.908
LITTLE BIT MORE TRANSPARENCY.

02:08:35.974 --> 02:08:37.209
BECAUSE THERE ARE FORTUNATELY

02:08:37.276 --> 02:08:38.877
IS A BUSINESS MODEL OUT THERE.

02:08:38.944 --> 02:08:40.179
THAT YOU'RE INCENTIVIZE FOR

02:08:40.245 --> 02:08:41.447
SOME OPERATORS THAT IF SOMEBODY

02:08:41.513 --> 02:08:43.148
HAS AN ADVANTAGE. THAT YOU

02:08:43.215 --> 02:08:43.949
CLEARLY DON'T WANT TO TRY AND

02:08:44.016 --> 02:08:45.084
TAKE THEIR BACK. UNLIKE ANY

02:08:45.150 --> 02:08:46.718
OTHER RETAIL WHERE THE WHOLE

02:08:46.785 --> 02:08:47.286

PRICE. TO THE RIGHT CUSTOMER.

02:08:51.123 --> 02:08:52.758

INFURIATING IS A SPORTS BETTER.

02:09:12.111 --> 02:09:13.812

BECOMES A MOVING TARGET. THAT

02:09:19.718 --> 02:09:22.054

IN THE THIRD OF A HOCKEY GAME

02:10:01.894 --> 02:10:02.628
IT'S NOT A CONTENTIOUS

02:10:02.694 --> 02:10:04.062
ATMOSPHERE DURING THE PAC

02:10:04.129 --> 02:10:05.464
TWELVE TOURNAMENT WHEN A TEAMS

GAMBLING PARLOUR HERE. IT

02:10:19.311 --> 02:10:21.046
ENGINE THIRTY OF WATCHING THE

02:10:21.113 --> 02:10:21.647

ANY IMPACT ON PARTICULAR FAN SO

02:10:24.683 --> 02:10:25.517
THERE'S A NUMBER OF THINGS TO

02:10:25.584 --> 02:10:26.919
CONSIDER I THINK FAN ENGAGEMENT

02:10:26.985 --> 02:10:27.519
IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST

02:10:27.586 --> 02:10:28.720
COMPONENTS THAT COMES ALONG

02:10:28.787 --> 02:10:30.389

SHIPS AND I THINK THAT'S PART

02:10:42.234 --> 02:10:43.769
OF THE REASON THAT WHEN YOU

LOOK AT SPORTS GAMBLING IN THE

02:10:45.070 --> 02:10:46.972
POTENTIAL LEGALIZATION TO TRY

FRAMEWORK FOR SPORTS BETTING

02:29:18.883 --> 02:29:20.551

INFORMATION IS IN THE HANDS OF

02:29:46.477 --> 02:29:47.878
THE OPERATORS AND SO IT'S

02:29:47.945 --> 02:29:49.914

02:33:57.127 --> 02:34:00.064
THESE RULES- AND WE ARE TRYING

02:34:00.130 --> 02:34:02.533
TO GET AT OUR PERSONNEL AND AS

02:34:02.600 --> 02:34:04.535
MANY DIFFERENT WAYS OVER THE

02:34:04.602 --> 02:34:05.703
COURSE OF THE SEASON AS WE CAN

02:34:05.769 --> 02:34:06.904
TO MAKE SURE THAT NO ONE WOULD

02:34:06.971 --> 02:34:08.939
BE ABLE SAID I DIDN'T KNOW- I

02:34:09.006 --> 02:34:11.342
COULDN'T DO THAT. THEY HAD YOU

02:34:11.408 --> 02:34:12.509
KNOW TAKE A REALLY STRICT ACT

02:34:12.576 --> 02:34:14.478
AND IF WE FIND SOMETHING SO.

02:34:14.545 --> 02:34:15.079
THOSE ARE THE TYPES OF THINGS

02:34:15.145 --> 02:34:20.317
WE DO. DIRECT MY QUESTION TO

02:34:20.384 --> 02:34:22.953
SEE THE- WE'VE HAD FOUR PANELS

02:34:23.020 --> 02:34:25.222
THUS FAR TODAY. ON THIS

02:34:25.289 --> 02:34:27.658
QUESTION OF NOT JUST THE

02:34:27.725 --> 02:34:29.827
INTEGRITY OF THE GAMES BUT THE

02:34:29.893 --> 02:34:32.896
CONSUMER EXPERIENCE THE. THE

02:34:32.963 --> 02:34:37.334
STATE PUBLIC GOOD NOT A SINGLE

02:34:37.401 --> 02:34:38.602
PAYER WILLIS HAS SUGGESTED THUS

02:34:38.669 --> 02:34:41.005
FAR THAT HAVING A BRICK AND

02:34:41.071 --> 02:34:43.107
MORTAR ONLY WITHOUT AN ONLINE

02:34:43.173 --> 02:34:45.376
COMPONENT IS GOOD FOR ANY THAT.

02:34:45.442 --> 02:34:45.943
WOULD YOU CONCUR WITH THOSE

02:34:46.010 --> 02:34:52.416
COMMENTS. WELL. I'D SAY THIS I

02:34:52.483 --> 02:34:54.351
I'M NOT IN THE GAMING INDUSTRY

02:34:54.418 --> 02:34:56.987
PER SE RIGHT SO I DON'T- MY

02:34:57.054 --> 02:34:57.755
EXPERTISE IS NOT GAMING

02:34:57.821 --> 02:35:01.525
PRODUCTS BUT- I DO THINK THAT-

02:35:01.592 --> 02:35:02.760
AS A PANELIST SAID EARLIER I

02:35:02.826 --> 02:35:05.262
WOULD AGREE IN TERMS OF THAT UP

02:35:05.329 --> 02:35:07.464
THE PRODUCTS THAT ARE AVAILABLE

02:35:07.531 --> 02:35:09.133
IN THE BETTING THAT'S AVAILABLE

02:35:09.199 --> 02:35:12.636
IF YOU'RE DOING IT RETAIL- IS

02:35:12.703 --> 02:35:14.972
NOT DIFFERENT A LOT ON SMALLER

02:35:15.039 --> 02:35:16.440
IN SCOPE THAN WHAT YOU CAN DO

02:35:16.507 --> 02:35:17.074
ONLINE PARTICULAR WITH IN PLAY

02:35:17.141 --> 02:35:19.977
BETTING AND I DO THINK. AND WE

02:35:20.044 --> 02:35:21.145
THINK THAT IMPORTANT ADDING IS

02:35:21.211 --> 02:35:23.881
THE FUTURE OF THAT AND IT'S

02:35:23.947 --> 02:35:26.483
BETTING IN EUROPE OUR GAME IS

02:35:26.550 --> 02:35:28.285
PRETTY DO SERVICE AS ONE OF THE

02:35:28.352 --> 02:35:32.589
PANELISTS SPOKE TO FOR IN PLAY

02:35:32.656 --> 02:35:35.726
BETTING WE THINK. IF DONE. AND

02:35:35.793 --> 02:35:37.695
DONE AS PART OF THE FRAME. OF

02:35:37.761 --> 02:35:39.296
TEXAN TERRY GAME IT CAN BE

02:35:39.363 --> 02:35:41.265
REALLY GOOD FOR ENGAGEMENT OUR

02:35:41.331 --> 02:35:41.865
FANS AND NOT SOMETHING WE WANT

02:35:41.932 --> 02:35:43.967
AND THAT GROWS THE PIE FOREVER.

02:35:44.034 --> 02:35:44.601
THE MORE SPECIFICALLY NAM I ASK

02:35:44.668 --> 02:35:45.936
YOU TO SPEAK. TO THE BUSINESS

02:35:46.003 --> 02:35:49.173
OF GAMING BUT AS IT RELATES TO

02:35:49.239 --> 02:35:51.642
INTEGRITY OF THE GAME YEAH HAVE

02:35:51.709 --> 02:35:54.044
AN ONLINE COMPONENT IS.

02:35:54.111 --> 02:35:55.546
ABSOLUTELY AND- I CAME TO THAT

02:35:55.612 --> 02:35:56.880
CONCLUSION VERY EARLY IN

02:35:56.947 --> 02:35:57.981
EDUCATING MYSELF ABOUT THIS

02:35:58.048 --> 02:36:00.784
BECAUSE- BECAUSE OF THE FACT

02:36:00.851 --> 02:36:02.219
THAT THERE IS A ROBUST ILLEGAL

02:36:02.286 --> 02:36:04.855
MARKET- THAT IS NOT GOOD FOR

02:36:04.922 --> 02:36:06.824
INTEGRITY IT'S IMPORTANT TO

02:36:06.890 --> 02:36:09.493
HAVE A LEGAL ALTERNATIVE- AND

02:36:09.560 --> 02:36:09.960
IT'S IMPORTANT HAVE A

02:36:10.027 --> 02:36:10.394
TRANSPARENT. AND IF

02:36:10.461 --> 02:36:13.597
TRANSPARENCY- IS WHAT- SURE IS

02:36:13.664 --> 02:36:15.432
INTEGRITY AND SO WE'RE

02:36:15.499 --> 02:36:17.334
TRANSPARENT YOU MAKE THE MARKET

02:36:17.401 --> 02:36:19.803
THE MORE THE DIFFERENT PEOPLE

02:36:19.870 --> 02:36:20.437
IN THE MARKET THE OPERATORS THE

02:36:20.504 --> 02:36:22.306
REGULATORS THE LEAGUE'S WORK

02:36:22.372 --> 02:36:24.241
TOGETHER- THE BETTER IT'S GOING

02:36:24.308 --> 02:36:27.411
TO BE FOR THE LEASE THE BETTER

02:36:27.478 --> 02:36:30.981
IT'S GOOD. FOR CONSUMERS AND.

02:36:31.048 --> 02:36:32.916
SINCE HE'S IN INTO THE PRODUCT

02:36:32.983 --> 02:36:33.884
THEY'RE GONNA BUT MORE IN THAT

02:36:33.951 --> 02:36:35.552
FOR THE STATE COFFERS AS WELL

02:36:35.619 --> 02:36:36.086
AS WEBER EIGHTY I THINK IT

02:36:36.153 --> 02:36:39.490
REALLY RIGHT RESULT BOATS. BOTH

02:36:39.556 --> 02:36:40.057
THE MID SHIP KIND OF LARGER

02:36:40.124 --> 02:36:41.291
SPORTS ECONOMY THIS IS. I THINK

02:36:41.358 --> 02:36:42.392
A PART OF DISCUSSION. THIS

02:36:42.459 --> 02:36:44.728
SEEMS TO GET LOST. I THINK WE

02:36:44.795 --> 02:36:46.363
HAVE DIALOGUE AMONGST THE

02:36:46.430 --> 02:36:48.065
MEMBERS THAT WE SHOULD

02:36:48.132 --> 02:36:50.667
LEGISLATURE. ON A PRETTY ROBUST

02:36:50.734 --> 02:36:51.902
SPORTS COMING CALIFORNIA YOU

02:36:51.969 --> 02:36:54.371
MENTION FIVE- BASEBALL TEAMS I

02:36:54.438 --> 02:36:55.906
THINK WE HAVE- IN THE

02:36:55.973 --> 02:36:57.775
NEIGHBORHOOD OF FIFTEEN-

02:36:57.841 --> 02:37:00.778
PROFESSIONAL SPORTS TEAMS- UP

02:37:00.844 --> 02:37:01.245
AND DOWN THE STATE OF

02:37:01.311 --> 02:37:01.779
CALIFORNIA THAT I ASSUME

02:37:01.845 --> 02:37:03.981
EMPLOY. WE YOU SAID THAT TENS

02:37:04.047 --> 02:37:06.183
OF MILLIONS AND- A FEW THOUSAND

02:37:06.250 --> 02:37:08.919
BUT I SUSPECT IF WE- TAKE THAT-

02:37:08.986 --> 02:37:10.487
THAT ENTIRE ECONOMY THAT'S

02:37:10.554 --> 02:37:11.255
PRETTY FAST ENOUGH NOT TO

02:37:11.321 --> 02:37:15.826
MENTION- IT WILL PANELISTS HERE

02:37:15.893 --> 02:37:20.364
TODAY THAT HAS A. TV SHOULD.

02:37:20.430 --> 02:37:20.964
DEAL WITH THE CURRENT BETTING

02:37:21.031 --> 02:37:23.834
WE'VE GOT. SPORTS SHOWS IT

02:37:23.901 --> 02:37:26.804
SEEMS THAT BOTH SPORTS WAGERING

02:37:26.870 --> 02:37:27.805
AND FANTASY SPORTS ARE

02:37:27.871 --> 02:37:29.039
SIGNIFICANTLY TIED TO THE

02:37:29.106 --> 02:37:30.974
SUCCESS OF YOUR ISSUE IN A AND

02:37:31.041 --> 02:37:33.076

CHANGES- TO TRY TO ADAPT AND

02:37:37.281 --> 02:37:41.084
EVOLVE- I ASSUME TO- THE

02:37:41.151 --> 02:37:42.653
CONSUMPTION HABITS OF BASEBALL

MONUMENTAL SPORTS OF A SPORTS

02:40:23.280 --> 02:40:25.749
BOOK THAT WILL BE. PART OF THE

CAPITAL ONE AENA STRUCTURE-

02:40:28.885 --> 02:40:32.089
BUT THAT HASN'T OPENED YET- AND

02:40:32.155 --> 02:40:33.123
IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT A LONG

02:40:33.190 --> 02:40:35.859
WITH THE REGULATIONS AND DC-

02:40:35.926 --> 02:40:37.928
THERE A COUPLE OF OTHERS THAT

ARE ARE LOOKING AT IT IN

02:40:39.663 --> 02:40:40.630
ILLINOIS WAY THERE'S AN

AUTHORIZATION. FOR SPORTS BOOKS

02:40:42.132 --> 02:40:45.869
TO BE ABLE- TO BE LOCATED AT-

02:40:45.936 --> 02:40:47.371
AT AN ARENA BUT THEY'RE STILL

02:40:47.437 --> 02:40:48.839
PRETTY EARLY ON AND THAT

02:40:48.905 --> 02:40:50.173
PROCESS AND NOTHING HAS

02:40:50.240 --> 02:40:52.776
HAPPENED YET SO- WE'RE SEEING

02:40:52.843 --> 02:40:54.011
WHERE THE VERY EARLY STAGES OF

02:40:54.077 --> 02:40:56.780
THAT AND HAVEN'T ACTUALLY. SEEN

02:40:56.847 --> 02:40:57.547
THAT COME TO FRUITION YET IN

02:40:57.614 --> 02:41:01.485
THE NBA BUT THERE'S INTEREST.

THERE IS INTEREST YES AND A

02:41:02.119 --> 02:41:02.552
COUPLE OF THINGS IN THE

02:41:02.619 --> 02:41:04.454
PIPELINE. YEAH EVENTUALLY

02:41:04.521 --> 02:41:05.389
BASEBALL CURRENT RULES DON'T

02:41:05.455 --> 02:41:07.557

02:41:13.163 --> 02:41:14.398
THAT OUR CLUBS WILL TAKE

02:41:14.464 --> 02:41:17.334
ADVANTAGE OF THE ABILITY TO-

02:41:17.401 --> 02:41:20.437
THE ABILITY THAT'S IN THE LAW

02:41:20.504 --> 02:41:21.004
