BY NT HOLDING UTILITIES

00:11:51.544 --> 00:11:54.714 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABLE WHEN THEY FALL THE

00:11:52.312 --> 00:11:56.382 region:rollup2
LAW.

00:11:54.714 --> 00:11:57.517 region:rollup2
SECOND INSURANCE COMPANIES MAY

00:11:56.382 --> 00:11:59.419 region:rollup2
BE MORE INCLINED TO ENSURE

00:11:57.517 --> 00:12:01.221 region:rollup2
UTILITIES IF UTILITY IS NOT

00:11:59.419 --> 00:12:02.322 region:rollup2
STRICTLY LIABLE.

00:12:01.221 --> 00:12:02.755 region:rollup2
NGUYEN.

00:12:02.322 --> 00:12:05.325 region:rollup2
WHICH REDUCES FUTURE

00:12:02.755 --> 00:12:06.960 region:rollup2
LIABILITIES.

00:12:05.325 --> 00:12:07.927 region:rollup2
AND LASTLY IT SHOULD ALSO LEADER

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:09.195 region:rollup2
IMPROVE CREDIT SCORES TO

00:12:07.927 --> 00:12:11.231 region:rollup2
UTILITIES AND LOWER THE COST OF

00:12:09.195 --> 00:12:12.131 region:rollup2
BORROWING.

00:12:11.231 --> 00:12:14.867 region:rollup2
WHICH IN THE END RESULTS IN

00:12:12.131 --> 00:12:16.703 region:rollup2
LOWER RATES.

00:12:14.867 --> 00:12:18.438 region:rollup2
IN CLOSING THERE ARE NO EASY

00:12:16.703 --> 00:12:20.139 region:rollup2
SOLUTIONS HERE.

00:12:18.438 --> 00:12:21.975 region:rollup2
HOWEVER IN A SIMILAR SITUATION

00:12:20.139 --> 00:12:23.509 region:rollup2
THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT.

00:12:21.975 --> 00:12:26.112 region:rollup2
A FIRM REALLY DECIDED TO PLAY A

00:12:23.509 --> 00:12:26.646 region:rollup2
REASON THIS TEST.

00:12:26.112 --> 00:12:28.548 region:rollup2
AS AN EXCEPTION TO INVERSE

00:12:26.646 --> 00:12:29.649 region:rollup2
CONDEMNATION.

00:12:28.548 --> 00:12:31.384 region:rollup2
THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL FALLS

00:12:29.649 --> 00:12:32.552 region:rollup2
ELITE OF COURT.

00:12:31.384 --> 00:12:34.220 region:rollup2
AND MAINTAINS ACCOUNTABILITY FOR

00:12:32.552 --> 00:12:35.321 region:rollup2
UTILITIES.

00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:38.391 region:rollup2
WHEN THEY ARE NEGLIGENT AND DOES

00:12:35.321 --> 00:12:39.826 region:rollup2
NOT CREATE A SAFE HARBOR?

00:12:38.391 --> 00:12:40.827 region:rollup2
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME THIS

00:12:39.826 --> 00:12:44.497 region:rollup2
AFTERNOON I'M AVAILABLE FOR YOUR

00:12:40.827 --> 00:12:46.332 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS [inaudible]

QUESTIONS [inaudible]

00:12:46.332 --> 00:12:52.338 region:rollup2
I'M.

00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:52.572 region:rollup2
THUNDERSTONE THANK YOU --

PRESIDENT.

00:12:54.073 --> 00:12:56.609 region:rollup2
A COUPLE QUESTIONS --

00:12:55.975 --> 00:12:59.512 region:rollup2
IN A YOU'RE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

00:12:56.609 --> 00:13:00.913 region:rollup2
--

00:12:59.512 --> 00:13:03.850 region:rollup2
COMPARING FLOOD DAMAGE TO TO

00:13:00.913 --> 00:13:04.817 region:rollup2
FIRE DAMAGE --

00:13:03.850 --> 00:13:06.853 region:rollup2
ISN'T IT TRUE THAT --

00:13:04.817 --> 00:13:10.223 region:rollup2
WHEN WERE?

00:13:06.853 --> 00:13:12.091 region:rollup2
BILL HAVING HEAVY RAINS AND AND

00:13:10.223 --> 00:13:14.360 region:rollup2
WE HAVE CONVEYANCES SO OUR

00:13:12.091 --> 00:13:16.963 region:rollup2
RIVERS AND RESERVOIRS SET.

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:19.499 region:rollup2
OF THE FLOODING DAMAGE CAN BE

00:13:16.963 --> 00:13:20.633 region:rollup2
READILY PREDICT --

00:13:19.499 --> 00:13:22.068 region:rollup2
WE HAVE A LOT OF SCIENTIFIC

00:13:20.633 --> 00:13:23.803 region:rollup2
EVIDENCE THAT SHOWS YOU KNOW IF

00:13:22.068 --> 00:13:25.405 region:rollup2
WE HAVE HEAVY SNOWPACK WE KNOW

00:13:23.803 --> 00:13:26.572 region:rollup2
EXACTLY HOW MUCH IT'S GOING TO

00:13:25.405 --> 00:13:27.140 region:rollup2
COME INTO A RESERVE FORCE HOW

00:13:26.572 --> 00:13:27.907 region:rollup2
MUCH OF A NEWBORN OR RIVERS

00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:29.208 region:rollup2
WERE.

00:13:27.907 --> 00:13:30.810 region:rollup2
WILDFIRES IS COMPLETELY

00:13:29.208 --> 00:13:31.978 region:rollup2
UNPREDICTABLE WE DON'T KNOW

00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:33.846 region:rollup2
EXACTLY WHERE THEY'RE GOING TO

00:13:31.978 --> 00:13:35.882 region:rollup2
START HOW THEY'RE GONNA START.

00:13:33.846 --> 00:13:36.883 region:rollup2
AND SO YOU KNOW I THINK THAT

00:13:35.882 --> 00:13:39.018 region:rollup2
THIS IS THAT KIND OF GET THE

00:13:36.883 --> 00:13:41.988 region:rollup2
LIABILITY ISSUES OCCUR THERE NOT

00:13:39.018 --> 00:13:46.092 region:rollup2
THE SAME TYPE THE LIABILITIES.

00:13:41.988 --> 00:13:47.827 region:rollup2
A WITH REGARD TO YOU KNOW --

00:13:46.092 --> 00:13:49.462 region:rollup2
UTILITIES AND WATER WATER COME

00:13:47.827 --> 00:13:51.164 region:rollup2
CONVEYORS.

00:13:49.462 --> 00:13:53.032 region:rollup2
BUT CENTER STONE I THINK IT'S AN

00:13:51.164 --> 00:13:54.667 region:rollup2
EXCELLENT QUESTION --

00:13:53.032 --> 00:13:56.836 region:rollup2
I AGREE THAT'S IMPORTANT OR

00:13:54.667 --> 00:13:59.072 region:rollup2
CLOSELY AT WHETHER OR NOT --

00:13:56.836 --> 00:14:00.873 region:rollup2
FLOOD CONTROL DISTRICT'S AND

00:13:59.072 --> 00:14:02.175 region:rollup2
THIS THE INFRASTRUCTURE THE DAY

00:14:00.873 --> 00:14:04.844 region:rollup2
THAT THEY HAVE IS SIMILAR TO

00:14:02.175 --> 00:14:06.179 region:rollup2
UTILITIES --

00:14:04.844 --> 00:14:08.548 region:rollup2
ULTIMATELY --

00:14:06.179 --> 00:14:10.116 region:rollup2
I'M I CAN'T TESTIFY AS TO HOW

00:14:08.548 --> 00:14:11.517 region:rollup2
THE FREQUENCY FLOODS AND THE

00:14:10.116 --> 00:14:13.186 region:rollup2
NATURE OF FLOODS IT'S BEYOND MY

00:14:11.517 --> 00:14:14.921 region:rollup2
KNOWLEDGE.

00:14:13.186 --> 00:14:16.522 region:rollup2
I I DO KNOW THOUGH THAT

00:14:14.921 --> 00:14:17.857 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES BENEFIT FROM THE

00:14:16.522 --> 00:14:19.359 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE FLOOD CONTROL

00:14:17.857 --> 00:14:20.126 region:rollup2
DISTRICT'S AND IT PROVIDES AN

00:14:19.359 --> 00:14:21.661 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY FOR THOSE

00:14:20.126 --> 00:14:22.929 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES TO FLOURISH.

00:14:21.661 --> 00:14:24.397 region:rollup2
AND THE COMMUNITIES RELY ON THE

00:14:22.929 --> 00:14:25.565 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE AND I KNOW THAT

00:14:24.397 --> 00:14:27.200 region:rollup2
THAT'S THE SAME CASE WITH YOU

00:14:25.565 --> 00:14:28.501 region:rollup2
TILT ELECTRIC UTILITIES.

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:29.902 region:rollup2
AND THE BENEFITS THAT THE

00:14:28.501 --> 00:14:30.603 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES CAME FROM THOSE

00:14:29.902 --> 00:14:32.171 region:rollup2
UTILITIES --

00:14:30.603 --> 00:14:33.539 region:rollup2
IS SIMILAR.

00:14:32.171 --> 00:14:34.774 region:rollup2
AND NO IT DOESN'T DIRECTLY

00:14:33.539 --> 00:14:38.244 region:rollup2
ANSWER YOUR QUESTION I CAN'T

00:14:34.774 --> 00:14:39.946 region:rollup2
SPEAK. TO TO THAT THE COMPARISON

00:14:38.244 --> 00:14:41.748 region:rollup2
BETWEEN FLATTENED AND WILDFIRES

00:14:39.946 --> 00:14:42.915 region:rollup2
APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR TEMPLE AND

00:14:41.748 --> 00:14:44.117 region:rollup2
LASTLY.

00:14:42.915 --> 00:14:45.818 region:rollup2
YOU MENTIONED SOMETHING CALLED

00:14:44.117 --> 00:14:48.121 region:rollup2
THE BEL AIR LA CLEAR TEST IS

00:14:45.818 --> 00:14:49.756 region:rollup2
THAT IS THAT A SUBTLE LAW IS

00:14:48.121 --> 00:14:51.390 region:rollup2
THAT -- A

00:14:49.756 --> 00:14:53.159 region:rollup2
DESCRIPTION OF A LEGAL

00:14:51.390 --> 00:14:54.193 region:rollup2
PROCEEDING WHAT EXACTLY IS THAT

00:14:53.159 --> 00:14:56.362 region:rollup2
NOWHERE IS A FOUND.

00:14:54.193 --> 00:14:58.564 region:rollup2
BUT THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION SIR.

00:14:56.362 --> 00:15:00.299 region:rollup2
ON THE BELLAIRE CASE IS THE

00:14:58.564 --> 00:15:02.135 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT CASE

00:15:00.299 --> 00:15:04.771 region:rollup2
WHICH HELD THAT FLOOD CONTROL

00:15:02.135 --> 00:15:09.008 region:rollup2
DISTRICTS WILL BE --

00:15:04.771 --> 00:15:10.076 region:rollup2
HELL TO DO DIFFERENT TYPE OF I

00:15:09.008 --> 00:15:11.411 region:rollup2
HAVE -- THE

00:15:10.076 --> 00:15:13.112 region:rollup2
CASE SITE FOR THAT AND I CAN TRY

00:15:11.411 --> 00:15:13.913 region:rollup2
THAT YOUR STAFF IF YOU'D LIKE.

00:15:13.112 --> 00:15:15.915 region:rollup2
BUT THEN --

00:15:13.913 --> 00:15:17.717 region:rollup2
LAUGHLIN IS THE CASE THAT

00:15:15.915 --> 00:15:19.285 region:rollup2
FOLLOWED THAT CASE AND FURTHER

00:15:17.717 --> 00:15:20.787 region:rollup2
DEVELOPED THE JURISPRUDENCE ON

00:15:19.285 --> 00:15:22.255 region:rollup2
THIS ISSUE AND SO THERE'S A

00:15:20.787 --> 00:15:23.156 region:rollup2
SERIES OF CASES --

00:15:22.255 --> 00:15:24.791 region:rollup2
PERTAINING TO FLOOD CONTROL

00:15:23.156 --> 00:15:26.793 region:rollup2
DISTRICTS THAT DEVELOPED THE

00:15:24.791 --> 00:15:28.261 region:rollup2
FACTORS THAT THE COURT SUPPLY

00:15:26.793 --> 00:15:29.996 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S COMMONLY.

00:15:28.261 --> 00:15:32.365 region:rollup2
IT COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS

00:15:29.996 --> 00:15:34.100 region:rollup2
THE BEL AIRE LAUGHLIN TEST OKAY

00:15:32.365 --> 00:15:35.501 region:rollup2
SO LOSES REFERS TO FLOOD CONTROL

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:37.236 region:rollup2
ISSUES SO YOU ADMIT YOU'RE

00:15:35.501 --> 00:15:39.872 region:rollup2
MAKING THE NEXUS BETWEEN.

00:15:37.236 --> 00:15:42.341 region:rollup2
THE BELLER LACHLAN TEST TOO OF

00:15:39.872 --> 00:15:43.609 region:rollup2
LIABILITY FOR FOR WILDFIRES YEAH

00:15:42.341 --> 00:15:46.179 region:rollup2
AND I I WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT

00:15:43.609 --> 00:15:47.213 region:rollup2
THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IS

00:15:46.179 --> 00:15:48.915 region:rollup2
MODELED AFTER THAT TEST.

00:15:47.213 --> 00:15:51.584 region:rollup2
THAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL

00:15:48.915 --> 00:15:52.084 region:rollup2
LOOKED AT THE CASE LAW THAT THE

00:15:51.584 --> 00:15:53.653 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT

00:15:52.084 --> 00:15:55.955 region:rollup2
DEVELOPED.

00:15:53.653 --> 00:15:57.290 region:rollup2
AND MODELED --

00:15:55.955 --> 00:15:59.492 region:rollup2
THE PROPOSAL THEM TO PUT EXCUSE

00:15:57.290 --> 00:16:00.893 region:rollup2
ME THAN THE PROPOSAL'S MODELED

00:15:59.492 --> 00:16:03.262 region:rollup2
AFTER THE FACTORS DEVELOPED BY

00:16:00.893 --> 00:16:06.065 region:rollup2
THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT.

00:16:03.262 --> 00:16:08.501 region:rollup2
AND THE IT A CLOSELY RESEMBLE.

00:16:06.065 --> 00:16:10.002 region:rollup2
THE THE THE FACTORS OF COURSE

00:16:08.501 --> 00:16:11.604 region:rollup2
TAKING ACCOUNT THAT UTILITIES AS

00:16:10.002 --> 00:16:12.939 region:rollup2
YOU MENTION ARE DIFFERENT.

00:16:11.604 --> 00:16:14.474 region:rollup2
IN SOME RESPECTS THAN FLOOD

00:16:12.939 --> 00:16:14.740 region:rollup2
CONTROL DISTRICT'S CERTS NOT

00:16:14.474 --> 00:16:16.042 region:rollup2
VERBATIM.

00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:17.710 region:rollup2
RESHAPE.

00:16:16.042 --> 00:16:18.010 region:rollup2
IF YOU CENTER JACKSON

00:16:17.710 --> 00:16:19.479 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

00:16:18.010 --> 00:16:20.847 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

00:16:19.479 --> 00:16:21.914 region:rollup2
SO WHAT I HEAR YOU SAYING IS

00:16:20.847 --> 00:16:24.617 region:rollup2
THAT WE SHOULD BE APPLYING THE

00:16:21.914 --> 00:16:26.319 region:rollup2
FLOOD CONTROL RULES SIMILARLY TO

00:16:24.617 --> 00:16:28.120 region:rollup2
THE ELECTRICAL GRID.

00:16:26.319 --> 00:16:29.889 region:rollup2
RATHER THAN HAVE THE STRICT

00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:31.424 region:rollup2
LIABILITY PROVISIONS THAT EXIST

00:16:29.889 --> 00:16:32.658 region:rollup2
TODAY SAID CORRECT.

00:16:31.424 --> 00:16:33.659 region:rollup2
YES I BELIEVE THAT --

00:16:32.658 --> 00:16:36.028 region:rollup2
SUMMARIZES THE GOVERNOR'S

00:16:33.659 --> 00:16:39.298 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL AND THE IF I'M NOT

00:16:36.028 --> 00:16:42.101 region:rollup2
MISTAKEN THOUGH THE THE FLOOD A

00:16:39.298 --> 00:16:43.569 region:rollup2
A CAN THE FLOOD CONTROL CONT

00:16:42.101 --> 00:16:45.304 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT OF ALL FROM UPPER

00:16:43.569 --> 00:16:46.539 region:rollup2
RIPARIAN LAND ISSUE SOMETHING

00:16:45.304 --> 00:16:47.840 region:rollup2
VERY DIFFERENT.

00:16:46.539 --> 00:16:48.574 region:rollup2
THAN WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:50.409 region:rollup2
HERE WITH THE UTILITIES IS NOT

00:16:48.574 --> 00:16:51.310 region:rollup2
CORRECT.

00:16:50.409 --> 00:16:53.379 region:rollup2
WELL --

00:16:51.310 --> 00:16:55.581 region:rollup2
UPPER RIPARIAN WATER ISSUES I

00:16:53.379 --> 00:16:57.383 region:rollup2
AGREE DIFFERENT THAN WILDFIRES

00:16:55.581 --> 00:17:00.219 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK THEY'RE SIMILAR IN

00:16:57.383 --> 00:17:01.654 region:rollup2
WHICH CLIMATE CHANGE HAS LEAD --

00:17:00.219 --> 00:17:03.222 region:rollup2
TO INCREASE FLOODING IN SOME

00:17:01.654 --> 00:17:05.758 region:rollup2
AREAS AND INCREASE WILDFIRE

00:17:03.222 --> 00:17:07.426 region:rollup2
FIRES IN OTHER AREAS.

00:17:05.758 --> 00:17:09.061 region:rollup2
BUT THE BASIS OF THE LAW THE

00:17:07.426 --> 00:17:10.763 region:rollup2
REASON FOR THE LAW COMES FROM

00:17:09.061 --> 00:17:13.132 region:rollup2
VERY VERY DIFFERENT PLACE.

00:17:10.763 --> 00:17:13.766 region:rollup2
BUT THAT'S CORRECT IT IT'S AN

00:17:13.132 --> 00:17:16.335 region:rollup2
OLDER --

00:17:13.766 --> 00:17:17.436 region:rollup2
BODY OF LAW THAT FOCUS ON ALL

00:17:16.335 --> 00:17:18.671 region:rollup2
THE OLDER FLOOD SHORTAGE AND

00:17:17.436 --> 00:17:20.039 region:rollup2
ISN'T IT TRUE THAT THE COURTS

00:17:18.671 --> 00:17:21.741 region:rollup2
HAVE FLAT OUT REJECTED THE

00:17:20.039 --> 00:17:23.576 region:rollup2
REASONABLENESS STANDARD BECAUSE

00:17:21.741 --> 00:17:25.011 region:rollup2
THE PRINCIPLES THAT A FLY

00:17:23.576 --> 00:17:26.646 region:rollup2
APPLYING THE FLOOD CONTEXT.

00:17:25.011 --> 00:17:29.815 region:rollup2
DON'T APPLY IN THE ELECTRICAL

00:17:26.646 --> 00:17:31.183 region:rollup2
CONTEXT -- I

00:17:29.815 --> 00:17:32.485 region:rollup2
AM NOT SURE WHICH CASE YOU'RE

00:17:31.183 --> 00:17:33.986 region:rollup2
REFERRING TO I DON'T KNOW IF I

00:17:32.485 --> 00:17:35.922 region:rollup2
AGREE WITH THAT ASSESSMENT OF

00:17:33.986 --> 00:17:37.590 region:rollup2
THEM NOT SO PERHAPS OUR NEXT

00:17:35.922 --> 00:17:38.758 region:rollup2
PANEL COULD ADDRESS THAT ISSUE.

00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:40.927 region:rollup2
BECAUSE REALLY WHAT I SEE YOU

00:17:38.758 --> 00:17:42.795 region:rollup2
DOING HERE WITH THIS PROPOSAL

00:17:40.927 --> 00:17:44.997 region:rollup2
SEEMS TO SORT OF CONFLATE. TO

00:17:42.795 --> 00:17:46.599 region:rollup2
MAKING THEM THE SAME BUT IN FACT

00:17:44.997 --> 00:17:48.868 region:rollup2
THEY REALLY AREN'T THE SAME AND

00:17:46.599 --> 00:17:51.737 region:rollup2
SO I HAVE LITTLE DIFFICULTY

00:17:48.868 --> 00:17:52.838 region:rollup2
APPLYING THIS JUST BECAUSE WE

00:17:51.737 --> 00:17:54.774 region:rollup2
USE IT -- IN

00:17:52.838 --> 00:17:56.208 region:rollup2
FLOOD CONTROL ASPECTS THAT

00:17:54.774 --> 00:17:56.676 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE USE AT THERE WE

00:17:56.208 --> 00:17:58.377 region:rollup2
SHOULD USE IT WITH THE

00:17:56.676 --> 00:17:59.245 region:rollup2
ELECTRICAL.

00:17:58.377 --> 00:18:01.347 region:rollup2
BUT THAT'S WHAT YOU ARE

00:17:59.245 --> 00:18:03.449 region:rollup2
SUGGESTING ARE YOU NOT.

00:18:01.347 --> 00:18:04.784 region:rollup2
WELL LET ME IF I MAY UM --

00:18:03.449 --> 00:18:06.018 region:rollup2
RESPOND BRIEFLY TO THAT AND I

00:18:04.784 --> 00:18:08.387 region:rollup2
THINK IT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT

00:18:06.018 --> 00:18:09.322 region:rollup2
POINT I'M GLAD YOU RAISED IT --

00:18:08.387 --> 00:18:11.691 region:rollup2
THIS IS SENATOR --

00:18:09.322 --> 00:18:13.159 region:rollup2
THE COURTS AND DEVELOPING A

00:18:11.691 --> 00:18:14.760 region:rollup2
FLOOD CONTROL DISTRICT CASES HAD

00:18:13.159 --> 00:18:16.329 region:rollup2
EXTENSIVE ANALYSIS OF THE PUBLIC

00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:17.363 region:rollup2
POLICY BENEFITS THAT

00:18:16.329 --> 00:18:20.299 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE PROVIDED AND I

00:18:17.363 --> 00:18:21.901 region:rollup2
NAME A COUPLE THEN --

00:18:20.299 --> 00:18:23.769 region:rollup2
HERE -- WE

00:18:21.901 --> 00:18:24.971 region:rollup2
HAVE A SIMILAR SITUATION --

00:18:23.769 --> 00:18:26.372 region:rollup2
WHERE THERE'S INFRASTRUCTURE

00:18:24.971 --> 00:18:27.473 region:rollup2
THAT HAS INHERENT RISK THE SAME

00:18:26.372 --> 00:18:28.941 region:rollup2
WAY THAT FLOOD CONTROL DISTRICTS

00:18:27.473 --> 00:18:30.509 region:rollup2
HAVE INHERENT RISK LEVEES FOR

00:18:28.941 --> 00:18:31.944 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE THERE'S INHERENT RISK

00:18:30.509 --> 00:18:33.512 region:rollup2
WITH THE LEVY --

00:18:31.944 --> 00:18:35.147 region:rollup2
NEAR A COMMUNITY.

00:18:33.512 --> 00:18:36.682 region:rollup2
AND THE CORD UNIFIED PUBLIC

00:18:35.147 --> 00:18:39.352 region:rollup2
POLICY REASONS FOR WHY IT'S A

00:18:36.682 --> 00:18:41.554 region:rollup2
PROBLEM TO HOLD --

00:18:39.352 --> 00:18:42.888 region:rollup2
THE THE INFRASTRUCTURE

00:18:41.554 --> 00:18:44.023 region:rollup2
ASSOCIATED WITH FLIGHT CONTROL

00:18:42.888 --> 00:18:46.158 region:rollup2
DISTRICTS STRICTLY LIABLE

00:18:44.023 --> 00:18:47.259 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT WILL PREVENT DICKS

00:18:46.158 --> 00:18:48.661 region:rollup2
UNITS FROM BENEFITING FROM ALL

00:18:47.259 --> 00:18:50.429 region:rollup2
THE BENEFITS.

00:18:48.661 --> 00:18:54.300 region:rollup2
AND I'M NOT TRYING TO SAY THAT'S

00:18:50.429 --> 00:18:55.434 region:rollup2
THE SAME AS A WAITRESS DE --

00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:57.036 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE BY INSANE AND IT

00:18:55.434 --> 00:18:58.838 region:rollup2
IS SIMILAR.

00:18:57.036 --> 00:18:59.672 region:rollup2
SOMEONE TO CLEAR I'M NOT TRYING

00:18:58.838 --> 00:19:00.606 region:rollup2
TO CONFLATE I'M JUST TRYING TO

00:18:59.672 --> 00:19:02.775 region:rollup2
SAY THAT THEY'RE SIMILAR AND I

00:19:00.606 --> 00:19:03.309 region:rollup2
THINK THE CASE IS PACKED BILL

00:19:02.775 --> 00:19:04.577 region:rollup2
VERSUS SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA

00:19:03.309 --> 00:19:06.445 region:rollup2
EDISON.

00:19:04.577 --> 00:19:07.980 region:rollup2
DIDN'T WELL I I GUESS ON

00:19:06.445 --> 00:19:09.649 region:rollup2
TROUBLED BY.

00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:11.584 region:rollup2
THE FACT THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO

00:19:09.649 --> 00:19:13.252 region:rollup2
COMPARE THE TWO IS APPLES TO

00:19:11.584 --> 00:19:15.221 region:rollup2
APPLES WHEN THEY'RE REALLY NOT.

00:19:13.252 --> 00:19:17.256 region:rollup2
SO IF THERE'S A JUSTIFICATION

00:19:15.221 --> 00:19:17.823 region:rollup2
WHY WE SHOULD BE APPLYING THOSE

00:19:17.256 --> 00:19:19.025 region:rollup2
STANDARDS IT SEEMS TO ME IT

00:19:17.823 --> 00:19:21.660 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE.

00:19:19.025 --> 00:19:24.163 region:rollup2
BASED ON THE UNIQUENESS OF ARE

00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:25.197 region:rollup2
UTILITY CIRCUMSTANCES NOT TRYING

00:19:24.163 --> 00:19:26.766 region:rollup2
TO SAY WELL IF WE DO IT FOR

00:19:25.197 --> 00:19:27.266 region:rollup2
FLOOD CONTROL WE SHOULD BE ABLE

00:19:26.766 --> 00:19:29.301 region:rollup2
TO DO IT.

00:19:27.266 --> 00:19:30.703 region:rollup2
HERE NIGHT I'D LIKE TO HAVE A

00:19:29.301 --> 00:19:32.605 region:rollup2
BET IF I IF YOU WILL A BETTER

00:19:30.703 --> 00:19:34.707 region:rollup2
REASON WHY --

00:19:32.605 --> 00:19:35.841 region:rollup2
THAT THE TWO ARE CONNECTED OR

00:19:34.707 --> 00:19:37.777 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE CONNECTED NOT THEY'RE

00:19:35.841 --> 00:19:38.411 region:rollup2
NOT CONNECTED NOW THE COURTS TO

00:19:37.777 --> 00:19:43.649 region:rollup2
MAKE CLEAR THEY'RE NOT CONNECTED

00:19:38.411 --> 00:19:46.752 region:rollup2
NOW -- SO --

00:19:43.649 --> 00:19:47.953 region:rollup2
A I'M TROUBLED BY THAT ANALOGY

00:19:46.752 --> 00:19:49.388 region:rollup2
BUT I WOULD LIKE --

00:19:47.953 --> 00:19:51.524 region:rollup2
<u><c.green>YOU MENTIONED THE FIVE</c></u>

00:19:49.388 --> 00:19:53.159 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENTS THE FIVE CONDITIONS

00:19:51.524 --> 00:19:55.027 region:rollup2
AND ONE OF THEM IS THAT THEY

00:19:53.159 --> 00:19:55.728 region:rollup2
OPERATE IN A REASONABLY PRUDENT

00:19:55.027 --> 00:19:57.496 region:rollup2
MANNER.

00:19:55.728 --> 00:19:59.899 region:rollup2
I THINK BASED UPON THE THE

00:19:57.496 --> 00:20:02.101 region:rollup2
DISCUSSIONS WE'VE HAD SO FAR

00:19:59.899 --> 00:20:03.502 region:rollup2
IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT THERE IS --

00:20:02.101 --> 00:20:05.604 region:rollup2
THE INMATES ARE ESSENTIALLY%

00:20:03.502 --> 00:20:08.941 region:rollup2
RUNNING THE ASYLUM THAT THERE

00:20:05.604 --> 00:20:10.576 region:rollup2
BEEN NO STANDARDS SET BY ANYBODY

00:20:08.941 --> 00:20:12.178 region:rollup2
AS TO WHAT IS REASONABLENESS.

00:20:10.576 --> 00:20:14.146 region:rollup2
ALSO BEFORE WE DECIDE SOMEONE'S

00:20:12.178 --> 00:20:15.114 region:rollup2
ACTING REASONABLE WE HAVE TO

00:20:14.146 --> 00:20:16.816 region:rollup2
FIGURE OUT WHAT REACH

00:20:15.114 --> 00:20:19.085 region:rollup2
REASONABLENESS WOULD BE IN THIS

00:20:16.816 --> 00:20:20.052 region:rollup2
CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH IS OF CONCERN

00:20:19.085 --> 00:20:20.820 region:rollup2
TO ME WHY WERE TALKING ABOUT

00:20:20.052 --> 00:20:22.354 region:rollup2
RICK.

00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:23.656 region:rollup2
LIMITING LIABILITY WHEN WE HAVE

00:20:22.354 --> 00:20:25.658 region:rollup2
NEWMAN TALKING ABOUT WHAT THE

00:20:23.656 --> 00:20:27.860 region:rollup2
UTILITY COMPANY SHOULD BE DOING

00:20:25.658 --> 00:20:28.661 region:rollup2
TO EVEN BE ABLE TO COME. TO A

00:20:27.860 --> 00:20:32.832 region:rollup2
BEFORE THE COURTS OR SOMEONE AND

00:20:28.661 --> 00:20:34.066 region:rollup2
SAY STILL DEFINITION P. YOU SEE

00:20:32.832 --> 00:20:36.168 region:rollup2
SAID THAT THEY'RE WAY BEHIND THE

00:20:34.066 --> 00:20:37.570 region:rollup2
BAR A EIGHT BALL ON THIS AND

00:20:36.168 --> 00:20:39.638 region:rollup2
UTILITIES TO FIND.

00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:41.006 region:rollup2
SAFETY IN RECENT BONUS ACCORDING

00:20:39.638 --> 00:20:42.074 region:rollup2
TO THE WAY THEY DEFINE IT.

00:20:41.006 --> 00:20:43.943 region:rollup2
SO HOW WOULD YOU ADDRESS THAT

00:20:42.074 --> 00:20:45.077 region:rollup2
PROBLEM.

00:20:43.943 --> 00:20:45.978 region:rollup2
BOSE SAID SENATOR I THINK THAT

00:20:45.077 --> 00:20:49.448 region:rollup2
YOU'VE RAISED AN IMPORTANT

00:20:45.978 --> 00:20:50.983 region:rollup2
QUESTION AND AT SOME SHOW TOO

00:20:49.448 --> 00:20:53.052 region:rollup2
AND YOU KNOW.

00:20:50.983 --> 00:20:55.087 region:rollup2
I APOLOGIZE IF I IF I SAID THE

00:20:53.052 --> 00:20:56.489 region:rollup2
FIVE SAID THAT REPEATEDLY --

00:20:55.087 --> 00:20:57.890 region:rollup2
YET I WON ADDRESS BRIEFLY --

00:20:56.489 --> 00:21:00.159 region:rollup2
AN ISSUE WHICH I THINK IS

00:20:57.890 --> 00:21:00.726 region:rollup2
COMMONLY DISCUSSED BUT HASN'T

00:21:00.159 --> 00:21:02.261 region:rollup2
REALLY BEEN ADDRESSED FULLY

00:21:00.726 --> 00:21:04.063 region:rollup2
HERE.

00:21:02.261 --> 00:21:05.131 region:rollup2
WHICH IS A NET THERE'S THE

00:21:04.063 --> 00:21:07.032 region:rollup2
NEGLIGENCE STANDARDS OF THE

00:21:05.131 --> 00:21:08.734 region:rollup2
SPEAR COURT AND THE JUDGE IS

00:21:07.032 --> 00:21:11.036 region:rollup2
GONNA APPLY THAT STANDARD AND

00:21:08.734 --> 00:21:12.872 region:rollup2
THIS PROPOSAL DOES NOT CHANGE

00:21:11.036 --> 00:21:16.475 region:rollup2
THAT STANDARD IN ANYWAY --

00:21:12.872 --> 00:21:17.943 region:rollup2
YEAH ONE OF THE FACTORS OF THE

00:21:16.475 --> 00:21:19.378 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IS UTILITIES

00:21:17.943 --> 00:21:23.349 region:rollup2
CONDUCT WHICH IS I BELIEVE WHAT

00:21:19.378 --> 00:21:24.817 region:rollup2
YOU'RE REFERENCING --

00:21:23.349 --> 00:21:25.484 region:rollup2
REGARDLESS OF HOW THE

00:21:24.817 --> 00:21:26.352 region:rollup2
LIABILITIES ACCRUED AT THE

00:21:25.484 --> 00:21:27.820 region:rollup2
COURTS.

00:21:26.352 --> 00:21:29.889 region:rollup2
EVENTUALLY.

00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:31.257 region:rollup2
NEWS UTILITY MAY SEE COST

00:21:29.889 --> 00:21:32.591 region:rollup2
RECOVERY AT THE COMMISSION.

00:21:31.257 --> 00:21:33.793 region:rollup2
AND THEIR WE'VE FLY RESOURCE

00:21:32.591 --> 00:21:35.694 region:rollup2
CENTER.

00:21:33.793 --> 00:21:37.496 region:rollup2
WHICH IS COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS

00:21:35.694 --> 00:21:40.166 region:rollup2
A PERIMETER STANDARD.

00:21:37.496 --> 00:21:41.901 region:rollup2
AND THOSE ARE OFTEN CONFLATED

00:21:40.166 --> 00:21:42.935 region:rollup2
BUT DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT

00:21:41.901 --> 00:21:44.203 region:rollup2
STANDARDS APPLIED BY DIFFERENT

00:21:42.935 --> 00:21:46.972 region:rollup2
BODIES [inaudible]

00:21:44.203 --> 00:21:48.574 region:rollup2
AND I HAVE NOT SHORT ANSWER

00:21:46.972 --> 00:21:49.642 region:rollup2
QUESTION BY ONE JUST PRIDE THAT

00:21:48.574 --> 00:21:51.710 region:rollup2
CLARITY --

00:21:49.642 --> 00:21:53.078 region:rollup2
TO COMMITTEE.

00:21:51.710 --> 00:21:54.380 region:rollup2
WELL THAT IS PART OF THE

00:21:53.078 --> 00:21:55.781 region:rollup2
QUESTION IS SENATORS.

00:21:54.380 --> 00:21:56.882 region:rollup2
TO WHOSE STANDARD WE GONNA USE

00:21:55.781 --> 00:21:58.751 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW THERE AREN'T ANY

00:21:56.882 --> 00:22:01.086 region:rollup2
STANDARDS WE HAVE --

00:21:58.751 --> 00:22:01.821 region:rollup2
SAN DIEGO GAS ELECTRIC THEY'VE

00:22:01.086 --> 00:22:04.990 region:rollup2
THEY'VE DETERMINE THEIR

00:22:01.821 --> 00:22:06.692 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBILITIES ARE APPEAR --

00:22:04.990 --> 00:22:08.060 region:rollup2
PEACHY ANY STANDARDS AND I'M

00:22:06.692 --> 00:22:09.728 region:rollup2
TOLD THERE'S NO ONE HERE TODAY

00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:11.197 region:rollup2
FROM PEACHY NEEDS TO SPEAK WHICH

00:22:09.728 --> 00:22:13.766 region:rollup2
IS KIND DISAPPOINTING.

00:22:11.197 --> 00:22:15.734 region:rollup2
BUT THEIR STANDARDS A HERE AND

00:22:13.766 --> 00:22:17.203 region:rollup2
EDISON STANDARDS APPARENTLY ARE

00:22:15.734 --> 00:22:18.037 region:rollup2
SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDDLE WHO

00:22:17.203 --> 00:22:21.574 region:rollup2
STOOD I MEAN.

00:22:18.037 --> 00:22:23.042 region:rollup2
E. THAT'S PART OF WHY WE HAVE

00:22:21.574 --> 00:22:24.777 region:rollup2
EARLY CARE ESSENTIALLY WHAT

00:22:23.042 --> 00:22:26.345 region:rollup2
YOU'RE SAYING IS WELL WE SHOULD

00:22:24.777 --> 00:22:27.980 region:rollup2
CARE WE SHOULD DETERMINE THIS ON

00:22:26.345 --> 00:22:29.648 region:rollup2
THE BASIS OF NEGLIGENCE.

00:22:27.980 --> 00:22:31.684 region:rollup2
BUT WHO'S TO DECIDE AT THIS

00:22:29.648 --> 00:22:33.886 region:rollup2
POINT WITHOUT ANY STANDARDS WHAT

00:22:31.684 --> 00:22:35.955 region:rollup2
IS AND ISN'T NEGLIGENT CONDUCT.

00:22:33.886 --> 00:22:37.456 region:rollup2
WELL I USE ON TUESDAY WE RECEIVE

00:22:35.955 --> 00:22:38.724 region:rollup2
TESTIMONY REGARDING ANOTHER

00:22:37.456 --> 00:22:39.725 region:rollup2
SECTION GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL

00:22:38.724 --> 00:22:41.827 region:rollup2
WHICH IS THE WHILE FIRE

00:22:39.725 --> 00:22:43.162 region:rollup2
MITIGATION PLANS --

00:22:41.827 --> 00:22:44.096 region:rollup2
I IT'S BEYOND THE SCOPE OF MY

00:22:43.162 --> 00:22:46.332 region:rollup2
TESTIMONY DISCUSS THOSE

00:22:44.096 --> 00:22:46.832 region:rollup2
STANDARDS AND THEIR QUESTIONS

00:22:46.332 --> 00:22:47.1000 region:rollup2
ABOUT WHO SHOULD SET THE

00:22:46.832 --> 00:22:49.001 region:rollup2
STANDARDS.

00:22:47.1000 --> 00:22:51.704 region:rollup2
BUT YOU WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THE

00:22:49.001 --> 00:22:52.871 region:rollup2
FACT THAT THOSE STANDARDS THAT

00:22:51.704 --> 00:22:55.140 region:rollup2
ARE ALSO PART OF GOVERNOR'S

00:22:52.871 --> 00:22:57.042 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL BECAUSE IT CALLS FOR

00:22:55.140 --> 00:22:58.944 region:rollup2
INCREASE AT FIRST INCREASE

00:22:57.042 --> 00:23:00.079 region:rollup2
EVALUATION WHETHER NOT UTILITY

00:22:58.944 --> 00:23:02.348 region:rollup2
IS COMPLYING WITH THEM.

00:23:00.079 --> 00:23:03.415 region:rollup2
AND SECOND INCREASE ENFORCEMENT

00:23:02.348 --> 00:23:05.017 region:rollup2
IF THEY'RE NOT COMPLYING WITH

00:23:03.415 --> 00:23:05.751 region:rollup2

IN THAT OUR DOCUMENT --

00:23:50.262 --> 00:23:52.931 region:rollup2
THERE ARE A FEW LINES THAT I

00:23:51.563 --> 00:23:54.900 region:rollup2
WANT TO JUST KIND OF READ IF

00:23:52.931 --> 00:23:56.869 region:rollup2
IT'S OKAY MISTER CHAIR.

00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:58.037 region:rollup2

TO THE GOVERNOR'S RULE ON THE

00:24:05.744 --> 00:24:10.716 region:rollup2
QUESTION WOULD BE.

IS THE GOVERNOR SATISFYING THE

00:24:10.716 --> 00:24:14.153 region:rollup2
REQUEST OF THE COMMISSIONERS.

00:24:12.685 --> 00:24:16.155 region:rollup2
IN HIS --

00:24:14.153 --> 00:24:17.222 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATION DOESN'T COVER THE

00:24:16.155 --> 00:24:19.058 region:rollup2
KIND OF THE BREATH OF WHAT

00:24:17.222 --> 00:24:20.526 region:rollup2
THEY'RE SEEKING.

FROM THE LEGISLATURE SO IN THE

00:24:20.526 --> 00:24:25.664 region:rollup2

THEY BOTH SAID WE RESPECTFULLY

TO AFFIRMATIVELY ADDRESS THE

00:24:29.001 --> 00:24:32.504 region:rollup2
ISSUES OF LIABILITY CALCULATION

00:24:31.136 --> 00:24:33.405 region:rollup2
AND COST ALLOCATION AND

00:24:32.504 --> 00:24:35.341 region:rollup2
INSTANCES WHEN UTILITY

00:24:33.405 --> 00:24:36.208 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE.

00:24:35.341 --> 00:24:38.711 region:rollup2
HE'S IMPLICATED IN PRIVATE

00:24:36.208 --> 00:24:40.612 region:rollup2
PROPERTY.

00:24:38.711 --> 00:24:42.081 region:rollup2
AND THEY GO ON TO SAY THE

00:24:40.612 --> 00:24:44.016 region:rollup2
ABILITY TO DO A MORE NUANCED

00:24:42.081 --> 00:24:45.517 region:rollup2
ASSESSMENT A FULL.

00:24:44.016 --> 00:24:46.752 region:rollup2
COULD BE I HELP FOR REGULATORY

LEGISLATURE. TO CONSIDER THE

ISSUE.

00:24:50.155 --> 00:24:53.559 region:rollup2
AND THEN FINALLY WE WERE IT

00:24:51.557 --> 00:24:54.760 region:rollup2

OF LIABILITY CALCULATION COST

00:24:57.796 --> 00:25:00.632 region:rollup2
ALLOCATION INSTANCES.

00:24:59.698 --> 00:25:02.301 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU TO LIDDY

00:25:00.632 --> 00:25:03.469 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURES IMPLICATED IN

00:25:02.301 --> 00:25:03.769 region:rollup2
PRIVATE PROPERTY LOSS

00:25:03.469 --> 00:25:06.238 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

00:25:03.769 --> 00:25:07.573 region:rollup2
SO.

00:25:06.238 --> 00:25:10.142 region:rollup2
WOULD YOU A IS IT.

00:25:07.573 --> 00:25:11.410 region:rollup2
CAN YOU COMMENT ON THAT.

00:25:10.142 --> 00:25:13.278 region:rollup2
YES SENATOR --

00:25:11.410 --> 00:25:15.481 region:rollup2
THAT CONCURRENCE IS.

00:25:13.278 --> 00:25:17.416 region:rollup2
FROM THE SAN DIEGO WE MY

00:25:15.481 --> 00:25:19.318 region:rollup2
DECISION EYES YOU MENTIONED AND

00:25:17.416 --> 00:25:21.120 region:rollup2
IT IDENTIFIES TWO ISSUES AND

00:25:19.318 --> 00:25:22.388 region:rollup2
I'VE TOUCH BRUTE BRIEFLY ON THEM

00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:23.322 region:rollup2
I WANNA CLARIFY WILL THAT

00:25:22.388 --> 00:25:26.258 region:rollup2
FURTHER.

00:25:23.322 --> 00:25:27.326 region:rollup2
THE FIRST IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF

00:25:26.258 --> 00:25:28.994 region:rollup2
LIABILITY THE COURTS.

00:25:27.326 --> 00:25:31.363 region:rollup2
AND I'D LIKE USE ANALOGY OF A

00:25:28.994 --> 00:25:32.698 region:rollup2
PIE THAT ONCE THE LIABILITIES

00:25:31.363 --> 00:25:34.199 region:rollup2
DETERMINED EITHER BY SETTLEMENT

00:25:32.698 --> 00:25:36.602 region:rollup2
OR BY JUDGMENTS.

00:25:34.199 --> 00:25:38.670 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE A PIE BEEN SHIRTS IS

00:25:36.602 --> 00:25:39.872 region:rollup2
GOING TO COVER SOME OF THAT.

00:25:38.670 --> 00:25:44.009 region:rollup2
BUT THE REMAINING THE REMAINDER

00:25:39.872 --> 00:25:45.077 region:rollup2
OF THAT PIE GOES PROBABLY. TO

00:25:44.009 --> 00:25:46.612 region:rollup2
APPLICATION FOR COST RECOVERY AT

00:25:45.077 --> 00:25:48.247 region:rollup2
THE COMMISSION.

00:25:46.612 --> 00:25:50.716 region:rollup2
THE DETERMINATION OF ALLOCATION

00:25:48.247 --> 00:25:52.051 region:rollup2
OF COSTS WHICH IS THE SECOND

00:25:50.716 --> 00:25:54.119 region:rollup2
PART OF THAT CONCURRENCE IS

00:25:52.051 --> 00:25:56.221 region:rollup2
ABOUT HOW YOU SLICE OF PIE.

00:25:54.119 --> 00:25:57.890 region:rollup2
AND SO WE'RE GONNA LOOK FOR WAYS

00:25:56.221 --> 00:25:59.458 region:rollup2
TO IMPROVE THE SITUATION.

00:25:57.890 --> 00:26:01.193 region:rollup2
THE FIRST STEP IS REDUCING THE

00:25:59.458 --> 00:26:02.694 region:rollup2
OVERALL SIZE OF THE PIE.

00:26:01.193 --> 00:26:04.296 region:rollup2
BECAUSE ONCE A LIABILITY HAS

00:26:02.694 --> 00:26:05.964 region:rollup2
ACCRUED.

00:26:04.296 --> 00:26:08.067 region:rollup2
HOUSE TO BE PAID BY SOMEBODY.

00:26:05.964 --> 00:26:09.268 region:rollup2
JUST BASIC MATH.

00:26:08.067 --> 00:26:10.769 region:rollup2
AND YOU COULD RIGHT NOW ENTERED

00:26:09.268 --> 00:26:11.703 region:rollup2
THE EXISTING SITUATION IS EITHER

00:26:10.769 --> 00:26:13.739 region:rollup2
GOING TO SHAREHOLDERS OR RATE

00:26:11.703 --> 00:26:15.641 region:rollup2
PAYERS.

00:26:13.739 --> 00:26:18.343 region:rollup2
THE GOES TO SHAREHOLDERS.

00:26:15.641 --> 00:26:19.578 region:rollup2
HIS DRAWBACKS TO IT AND LEAD TO

00:26:18.343 --> 00:26:21.213 region:rollup2
HIGHER COST OF BORROWING.

00:26:19.578 --> 00:26:22.481 region:rollup2
MAKES IT HARDER TO INSURANCE AND

00:26:21.213 --> 00:26:23.449 region:rollup2
ULTIMATELY.

00:26:22.481 --> 00:26:24.850 region:rollup2
THOSE TWO THINGS LEAD TO HIGHER

00:26:23.449 --> 00:26:27.152 region:rollup2
RATES.

00:26:24.850 --> 00:26:27.753 region:rollup2
IT GOES TO RATEPAYERS.

00:26:27.152 --> 00:26:29.021 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY THAT MEANS THE RATES

00:26:27.753 --> 00:26:30.656 region:rollup2
GO UP [inaudible]

00:26:29.021 --> 00:26:33.892 region:rollup2
AND SO.

00:26:30.656 --> 00:26:35.461 region:rollup2
THAT'S IS A TWO PART PROBLEM AND

00:26:33.892 --> 00:26:37.429 region:rollup2
THE FIRST PART INVERSE CONDITION

00:26:35.461 --> 00:26:39.231 region:rollup2
REFORM AS PROPOSED BY THE

00:26:37.429 --> 00:26:40.599 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR GOES TO THE CALCULATION

00:26:39.231 --> 00:26:41.733 region:rollup2
Y. BILLY.

00:26:40.599 --> 00:26:44.937 region:rollup2
THE SECOND PART IS HOW THE

00:26:41.733 --> 00:26:46.305 region:rollup2
COMMISSION ALLOCATE COSTS.

00:26:44.937 --> 00:26:47.439 region:rollup2
AND TO ANSWER QUESTION.

00:26:46.305 --> 00:26:48.707 region:rollup2
I BELIEVE --

00:26:47.439 --> 00:26:49.341 region:rollup2
MICHAEL PICKER BELIEVES THAT THE

00:26:48.707 --> 00:26:50.676 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL DOES ADDRESS

00:26:49.341 --> 00:26:52.411 region:rollup2
--

00:26:50.676 --> 00:26:54.980 region:rollup2
HIS.

00:26:52.411 --> 00:26:56.381 region:rollup2
COMMENTS NOT CONCURRENCE.

00:26:54.980 --> 00:27:00.119 region:rollup2
THANK YOU HAVE YOU --

00:26:56.381 --> 00:27:03.689 region:rollup2
BEEN MADE AWARE OF THE DECISION

00:27:00.119 --> 00:27:05.591 region:rollup2
BY THE LIL LEG LEDGE COUNCIL

00:27:03.689 --> 00:27:07.659 region:rollup2
BASICALLY OF THE LEGISLATIVE

00:27:05.591 --> 00:27:09.995 region:rollup2
COUNSEL THAT WAS --

00:27:07.659 --> 00:27:12.431 region:rollup2
AN OPINION ISSUED JULY FIFTH.

00:27:09.995 --> 00:27:13.999 region:rollup2
REGARDING A STATUTORY MENDING OF

00:27:12.431 --> 00:27:15.567 region:rollup2
THE CONSTITUTION AND I THINK IT

00:27:13.999 --> 00:27:17.302 region:rollup2
GETS TO THE SOME OF THE PIE THAT

00:27:15.567 --> 00:27:17.603 region:rollup2
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

00:27:17.302 --> 00:27:21.240 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

00:27:17.603 --> 00:27:23.141 region:rollup2
AND ARE AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE

00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:24.877 region:rollup2
OF THE LETTER THEIR OPINION AS

00:27:23.141 --> 00:27:26.311 region:rollup2
IT'S THE PIN OPINION THAT THE

00:27:24.877 --> 00:27:28.280 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE MAY NOT BY A

00:27:26.311 --> 00:27:30.282 region:rollup2
STATUTORY MEASURE EITHER AMEND

00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:31.483 region:rollup2
THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION.

00:27:30.282 --> 00:27:33.085 region:rollup2
OR INTERPRET THE CALIFORNIA

00:27:31.483 --> 00:27:34.219 region:rollup2
CONSTITUTION A MATTER THAT

00:27:33.085 --> 00:27:36.188 region:rollup2
CONFLICTS.

00:27:34.219 --> 00:27:37.222 region:rollup2
WITH THE JUDICIAL CONSTRUCTION.

00:27:36.188 --> 00:27:41.226 region:rollup2
SO WOULD YOU [inaudible]

00:27:37.222 --> 00:27:43.262 region:rollup2
OF CONSIDER THAT.

00:27:41.226 --> 00:27:44.963 region:rollup2
A CONFLICT WITH OUR ABILITY TO

00:27:43.262 --> 00:27:46.165 region:rollup2
FACT KIND OF THE SIZE OF THE PIE

00:27:44.963 --> 00:27:47.633 region:rollup2
THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT NOT

00:27:46.165 --> 00:27:49.434 region:rollup2
NECESSARILY.

00:27:47.633 --> 00:27:51.370 region:rollup2
BUT YOU KNOW THE THE ALLOCATION

00:27:49.434 --> 00:27:53.939 region:rollup2
OF OF OVER.

00:27:51.370 --> 00:27:56.074 region:rollup2
OR OR ASSIGNING BLAME TO THOSE

00:27:53.939 --> 00:27:57.543 region:rollup2
SET THAT MAY SHARE BLAME AND AN

00:27:56.074 --> 00:27:59.711 region:rollup2
INCIDENT THAT.

00:27:57.543 --> 00:28:02.714 region:rollup2
CAN WE INFLUENCE THE SIZE OF THE

00:27:59.711 --> 00:28:03.782 region:rollup2
PIE IN ITS ENTIRETY.

00:28:02.714 --> 00:28:05.317 region:rollup2
SENATOR I BELIEVE MICHAEL WORE

00:28:03.782 --> 00:28:06.618 region:rollup2
OF ADDRESS THE QUESTION

00:28:05.317 --> 00:28:08.921 region:rollup2
CONSTITUTIONALITY.

00:28:06.618 --> 00:28:11.223 region:rollup2
OF THE PROPOSAL AND IN HIS

00:28:08.921 --> 00:28:11.623 region:rollup2
TESTIMONY LAST WEEK HE SAID THAT

00:28:11.223 --> 00:28:12.724 region:rollup2
HE THOUGHT IT WAS

00:28:11.623 --> 00:28:15.494 region:rollup2
CONSTITUTIONAL.

00:28:12.724 --> 00:28:16.395 region:rollup2
I AGREE IT IS ASSESSMENT --

00:28:15.494 --> 00:28:18.897 region:rollup2
THE DOCTORATE INVERSE

00:28:16.395 --> 00:28:20.032 region:rollup2
CONDEMNATION SINCE NINETEEN

00:28:18.897 --> 00:28:21.433 region:rollup2
SIXTY FIVE HAS BASICALLY BEEN

00:28:20.032 --> 00:28:22.301 region:rollup2
BASED ON INTERPRETATION OF THE

00:28:21.433 --> 00:28:25.237 region:rollup2
CONSTITUTION.%

00:28:22.301 --> 00:28:25.837 region:rollup2
PREVIOUSLY SPACE OFFER COMMENT

00:28:25.237 --> 00:28:27.239 region:rollup2
COMMON LAW TOWARD PROPERTY LAW

00:28:25.837 --> 00:28:29.408 region:rollup2
--

00:28:27.239 --> 00:28:32.010 region:rollup2
AND AND I I I BELIEVE THAT IS

00:28:29.408 --> 00:28:33.745 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE AND AND LEGAL --

00:28:32.010 --> 00:28:34.513 region:rollup2
FOR THIS LEGISLATURE TO ACT AND

00:28:33.745 --> 00:28:35.480 region:rollup2
I CONSISTENT THE GOVERNOR'S

00:28:34.513 --> 00:28:37.015 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL.

00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:39.184 region:rollup2
BUT AS I SAID EARLIER THAT

00:28:37.015 --> 00:28:41.253 region:rollup2
QUESTION WILL LIKELY BE CITED BY

00:28:39.184 --> 00:28:45.591 region:rollup2
COURT IF THIS PROPOSAL OR

00:28:41.253 --> 00:28:47.926 region:rollup2
SOMEWHERE ONE BECOMES LAW --

00:28:45.591 --> 00:28:51.863 region:rollup2
ASSEMBLY MEMBER RACE.

00:28:47.926 --> 00:28:55.601 region:rollup2
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR.

00:28:51.863 --> 00:28:58.704 region:rollup2
I I TO A LITTLE CONCERNED ABOUT.

00:28:55.601 --> 00:29:00.839 region:rollup2
USING FLOOD CONTROL DISTRICT'S.

00:28:58.704 --> 00:29:03.675 region:rollup2
AND THE STANDARDS USED FOR THEM

00:29:00.839 --> 00:29:05.444 region:rollup2
AND APPLYING THOSE TO UTILITIES.

00:29:03.675 --> 00:29:07.045 region:rollup2
SO SOME BASIC QUESTIONS OF FLOOD

00:29:05.444 --> 00:29:10.349 region:rollup2
CONTROL DISTRICT.

00:29:07.045 --> 00:29:10.916 region:rollup2
IS THAT PUBLICLY OWNED ORDERS

00:29:10.349 --> 00:29:13.652 region:rollup2
BUT OUR DEEP SHAREHOLDERS IN

00:29:10.916 --> 00:29:15.153 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:29:13.652 --> 00:29:16.288 region:rollup2
AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER I'M NOT --

00:29:15.153 --> 00:29:17.789 region:rollup2
AND EXPERIENCE LOOKED FLOOD

00:29:16.288 --> 00:29:18.890 region:rollup2
CONTROL DISTRICT'S BUT I CAN'T

00:29:17.789 --> 00:29:20.692 region:rollup2
SAY THAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL

00:29:18.890 --> 00:29:24.196 region:rollup2
WOULD APPLY TO BOTH INVESTOR AND

00:29:20.692 --> 00:29:26.765 region:rollup2
PUBLICLY OWNED UTILITIES.

00:29:24.196 --> 00:29:30.736 region:rollup2
AGAIN I'M CONCERNED BECAUSE IF

00:29:26.765 --> 00:29:33.405 region:rollup2
WE HAVE THE THE PUBLICLY OWNED

00:29:30.736 --> 00:29:33.705 region:rollup2
UTILITY COMPANY YOU HAVE CEOS

00:29:33.405 --> 00:29:37.175 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

00:29:33.705 --> 00:29:39.244 region:rollup2
IF SHAREHOLDERS YOU HAVE.

00:29:37.175 --> 00:29:40.512 region:rollup2
GUARANTEED RATES OF RETURN FOR

00:29:39.244 --> 00:29:41.313 region:rollup2
THE SHAREHOLDERS.

00:29:40.512 --> 00:29:43.615 region:rollup2
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE THAT FOR

00:29:41.313 --> 00:29:45.183 region:rollup2
FLOOD CONTROL DISTRICT.

00:29:43.615 --> 00:29:46.551 region:rollup2
SO WOULDN'T IT BE YOUR LAST ONE

00:29:45.183 --> 00:29:48.387 region:rollup2
OF YOUR LAST CMMENT TO SAID

00:29:46.551 --> 00:29:50.756 region:rollup2
ONCE LIABILITIES DETERMINED.

00:29:48.387 --> 00:29:53.225 region:rollup2
SOMEONE HOUSE TO PAY.

00:29:50.756 --> 00:29:54.860 region:rollup2
THAT'S TRUEFOR FOR ANYTHING.

00:29:53.225 --> 00:29:56.028 region:rollup2
ANYTHING THAT ANY OF US TO

00:29:54.860 --> 00:29:57.295 region:rollup2
SOMEONE HAS TO PAY.

00:29:56.028 --> 00:29:59.298 region:rollup2
SO WE HAVE INSURANCE WE'VE

00:29:57.295 --> 00:30:00.866 region:rollup2
ENOUGH INSURANCE.

00:29:59.298 --> 00:30:02.467 region:rollup2
AND IF WE DON'T THEN IF IT'S

00:30:00.866 --> 00:30:03.602 region:rollup2
BEFORE THE OWNERS OF IT THEN WE

00:30:02.467 --> 00:30:05.704 region:rollup2
HAVE TO KNOW THAT WE'RE GOING TO

00:30:03.602 --> 00:30:06.805 region:rollup2
HAVE TO PAY FOR IT.

00:30:05.704 --> 00:30:08.407 region:rollup2
AND SO YOU HAVE TO LOOK TWO WAYS

00:30:06.805 --> 00:30:11.243 region:rollup2
TO PREVENT.

00:30:08.407 --> 00:30:12.277 region:rollup2
GETTING TO THAT POINT SO YOU

00:30:11.243 --> 00:30:14.012 region:rollup2
WORK IT SEEMS THAT WE'RE WERE

00:30:12.277 --> 00:30:15.447 region:rollup2
STARTING AT THE END RATHER THAN

00:30:14.012 --> 00:30:16.815 region:rollup2
STARTING AT THE BEGINNING.

00:30:15.447 --> 00:30:19.184 region:rollup2
AND AT THE BEGINNING WE HAVE TO

00:30:16.815 --> 00:30:21.386 region:rollup2
FIGURE OUT WHAT RESPONSIBILITY

00:30:19.184 --> 00:30:22.988 region:rollup2
THERE IS TO AVOID GETTING TO

00:30:21.386 --> 00:30:24.489 region:rollup2
THIS POINT.

00:30:22.988 --> 00:30:26.258 region:rollup2
SO IT GOES TO THE PREVENTION

00:30:24.489 --> 00:30:28.126 region:rollup2
GOES TO EVERYTHING ELSE THAT

00:30:26.258 --> 00:30:30.696 region:rollup2
WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT.

00:30:28.126 --> 00:30:32.664 region:rollup2
AND AS THE GOOD SENATOR SAID.

00:30:30.696 --> 00:30:35.567 region:rollup2
WE WERE TAKING CARE OF THEM.

00:30:32.664 --> 00:30:36.635 region:rollup2
AND WE'RE NOW LOOKING FOR WAYS

00:30:35.567 --> 00:30:38.103 region:rollup2
TO THE END THAT FIT SUPPORT

00:30:36.635 --> 00:30:39.638 region:rollup2
CHOICE OF WORDS.

00:30:38.103 --> 00:30:42.507 region:rollup2
BUT IT IT'S A WORD THAT'S BEING

00:30:39.638 --> 00:30:43.675 region:rollup2
USED BY MANY WHO CONTACT MY

00:30:42.507 --> 00:30:45.610 region:rollup2
OFFICE.

00:30:43.675 --> 00:30:47.145 region:rollup2
ON MANY OR TALKING ABOUT IT

00:30:45.610 --> 00:30:48.680 region:rollup2
THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT A BAILOUT.

00:30:47.145 --> 00:30:50.649 region:rollup2
FOR THE UTILITIES.

00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:52.851 region:rollup2
THAT ISN'T OUR PURPOSE.

00:30:50.649 --> 00:30:54.853 region:rollup2
IT ABSOLUTELY IS NOT OUR PURPOSE

00:30:52.851 --> 00:30:57.389 region:rollup2
WE WANT TO FIND WAYS TO MAKE

00:30:54.853 --> 00:30:58.957 region:rollup2
SURE THAT WE ARE TAKING CARE OF

00:30:57.389 --> 00:31:01.226 region:rollup2
THOSE WHO ARE YOU.

00:30:58.957 --> 00:31:03.929 region:rollup2
RECEIVING THE BENEFIT.

00:31:01.226 --> 00:31:06.131 region:rollup2
HERE ELECTRICITY IT --

00:31:03.929 --> 00:31:08.066 region:rollup2
ALL OF THE UTILITIES.

00:31:06.131 --> 00:31:10.969 region:rollup2
WE ALSO WANT TO BE SURE THAT IF

00:31:08.066 --> 00:31:13.472 region:rollup2
SOMEONE HAS A RESPONSIBILITY TO

00:31:10.969 --> 00:31:15.607 region:rollup2
KEEP AN AREA SAFE KEEP IT FROM.

00:31:13.472 --> 00:31:16.108 region:rollup2
IGNITING.

00:31:15.607 --> 00:31:17.442 region:rollup2
BUT THEY DO WHAT THEY'RE

00:31:16.108 --> 00:31:18.610 region:rollup2
SUPPOSED TO DO.

00:31:17.442 --> 00:31:20.612 region:rollup2
AND I I PAID.

00:31:18.610 --> 00:31:22.147 region:rollup2
STILL HAVE NOT HEARD THAT.

00:31:20.612 --> 00:31:23.014 region:rollup2
I HAVEN'T HEARD ABOUT WHAT WE'RE

00:31:22.147 --> 00:31:24.449 region:rollup2
DOING.

00:31:23.014 --> 00:31:26.351 region:rollup2
WHAT WE'RE DOING TO MAKE SURE

00:31:24.449 --> 00:31:27.853 region:rollup2
THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN WERE INSTEAD

00:31:26.351 --> 00:31:29.054 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT THE?

00:31:27.853 --> 00:31:31.923 region:rollup2
THE TAIL END AND TRYING TO

00:31:29.054 --> 00:31:34.960 region:rollup2
FIGURE OUT HOW WE PROTECT.

00:31:31.923 --> 00:31:36.194 region:rollup2
SOMEONE WHO AREN'T ENTITY THAT

00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:36.962 region:rollup2
HAS BEEN FOUND TO HAVE BEEN

00:31:36.194 --> 00:31:38.730 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBLE FOR MANY OF THE

00:31:36.962 --> 00:31:40.665 region:rollup2
FIRES.

00:31:38.730 --> 00:31:42.200 region:rollup2
I HAVE A REAL PROBLEM WITH THAT.

00:31:40.665 --> 00:31:42.934 region:rollup2
BUT VERY SPECIFICALLY HAVING TO

00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:44.569 region:rollup2
DO WITH THE FLOOD CONTROL

00:31:42.934 --> 00:31:47.706 region:rollup2
DISTRICT'S.

00:31:44.569 --> 00:31:49.274 region:rollup2
DO YOU SEE A DIFFERENCE SPECIFIC

00:31:47.706 --> 00:31:51.743 region:rollup2
BUT WHEN IT COMES TO SALARIES

00:31:49.274 --> 00:31:54.179 region:rollup2
WHEN IT COMES TO DIVIDENDS WHEN

00:31:51.743 --> 00:31:55.947 region:rollup2
IT COMES TO RATE OF RETURN. FOR

00:31:54.179 --> 00:31:58.650 region:rollup2
A UTILITY VERSUS THE FLOOD

00:31:55.947 --> 00:31:59.584 region:rollup2
CONTROL DISTRICT.

00:31:58.650 --> 00:32:00.786 region:rollup2
WELL YOU'RE.

00:31:59.584 --> 00:32:02.087 region:rollup2
I I THINK YOU'VE.

00:32:00.786 --> 00:32:04.623 region:rollup2
PUT YOUR FINGER ON IMPORTANT

00:32:02.087 --> 00:32:06.758 region:rollup2
IMPORTANTISSUE AND I SHARE YOUR

00:32:04.623 --> 00:32:09.161 region:rollup2
CONCERN AND I DON'T THINK ANYONE

00:32:06.758 --> 00:32:10.495 region:rollup2
WANTS TO SEE A BAILOUT --

00:32:09.161 --> 00:32:12.430 region:rollup2
I WOULD NOT CHARACTERIZE THIS IS

00:32:10.495 --> 00:32:14.032 region:rollup2
BELL OUT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL

00:32:12.430 --> 00:32:15.801 region:rollup2
HOLDS UTILITIES ACCOUNTABLE IF

00:32:14.032 --> 00:32:17.135 region:rollup2
ACT NEGLIGENTLY.

00:32:15.801 --> 00:32:19.171 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK IT STRIKES A CAREFUL

00:32:17.135 --> 00:32:20.972 region:rollup2
BALANCE BETWEEN HOLDING THEM I

00:32:19.171 --> 00:32:21.873 region:rollup2
CAN'T ACCOUNTABLE ENACT

00:32:20.972 --> 00:32:23.809 region:rollup2
NEGLIGENTLY.

00:32:21.873 --> 00:32:26.144 region:rollup2
BUT NOT DONE MAKING THEM THE

00:32:23.809 --> 00:32:28.046 region:rollup2
BACKSTOP FINANCIALLY FOR ALL

00:32:26.144 --> 00:32:29.414 region:rollup2
NATURAL DISASTERS --

00:32:28.046 --> 00:32:31.850 region:rollup2
I AGREE WITH YOUR SECOND POINT

00:32:29.414 --> 00:32:35.220 region:rollup2
CLEARLY A FLOOD CONTROL DISTRICT

00:32:31.850 --> 00:32:36.221 region:rollup2
IS DIFFERENT THAN A LARGE

00:32:35.220 --> 00:32:41.159 region:rollup2
INVESTOR OWNED UTILITY I I THINK

00:32:36.221 --> 00:32:41.526 region:rollup2
THAT'S VERY CLEAR.

00:32:41.159 --> 00:32:43.361 region:rollup2
HE DIDN'T IF.

00:32:41.526 --> 00:32:45.797 region:rollup2
LIST SHARE ONE OF THE QUESTIONS

00:32:43.361 --> 00:32:48.366 region:rollup2
THAT I THAT I ASK YOU IS.

00:32:45.797 --> 00:32:50.569 region:rollup2
WHAT NEEDS TO BE PROVEN IN THE

00:32:48.366 --> 00:32:51.603 region:rollup2
INVERSE CONDEMNATION AND? ONE OF

00:32:50.569 --> 00:32:51.803 region:rollup2
THE JURY INSTRUCTIONS HAS TO DO

00:32:51.603 --> 00:32:54.306 region:rollup2
WITH.

00:32:51.803 --> 00:32:56.942 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:32:54.306 --> 00:32:58.276 region:rollup2
THE THE CAUSE OF THE FIRE.

00:32:56.942 --> 00:33:00.545 region:rollup2
THE SUBSTANTIAL FACTOR HAD TWO

00:32:58.276 --> 00:33:03.081 region:rollup2
BANDS UTILITIES.

00:33:00.545 --> 00:33:04.649 region:rollup2
AND IF WE'RE AT THAT POINT IN

00:33:03.081 --> 00:33:05.750 region:rollup2
THE HEAT SO THAT THEY'RE NOT THE

00:33:04.649 --> 00:33:07.419 region:rollup2
INTEREST COMBINATIONS LIKE ON

00:33:05.750 --> 00:33:09.221 region:rollup2
BECOME TOLD THAT IS PROVEN IS

00:33:07.419 --> 00:33:10.288 region:rollup2
THAT TRUE.

00:33:09.221 --> 00:33:11.122 region:rollup2
THAT SURE UNDER INVERSE

00:33:10.288 --> 00:33:13.225 region:rollup2
CONDEMNATION ON ELM IS

00:33:11.122 --> 00:33:14.125 region:rollup2
SUBSTANTIAL BECAUSE AND IF

00:33:13.225 --> 00:33:16.394 region:rollup2
THEY'RE FOUND TO BE A

00:33:14.125 --> 00:33:18.797 region:rollup2
SUBSTANTIAL FACTOR OF THE FIRE

00:33:16.394 --> 00:33:19.431 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHEN THEY'RE FOUND.

00:33:18.797 --> 00:33:22.234 region:rollup2
STRICTLY LIVE ROOMS ARE CORRECT

00:33:19.431 --> 00:33:23.168 region:rollup2
--

00:33:22.234 --> 00:33:24.736 region:rollup2
WELL THEY COULD BE THEY COULD BE

00:33:23.168 --> 00:33:26.538 region:rollup2
A SUBSTANTIAL CAUSE BUT FOR

00:33:24.736 --> 00:33:28.240 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE --

00:33:26.538 --> 00:33:29.741 region:rollup2
THEY COULD BE ACOSTA NOT ACTED

00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:30.775 region:rollup2
NEGLIGENTLY ANYWAY.

00:33:29.741 --> 00:33:33.512 region:rollup2
SO THAT THAT'S AN IMPORTANT

00:33:30.775 --> 00:33:35.080 region:rollup2
DISTINCTION IS GOOD THAT DID.

00:33:33.512 --> 00:33:37.048 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE CAN BE --

00:33:35.080 --> 00:33:38.250 region:rollup2
PART OF THAT WORK IN THE FIRE

00:33:37.048 --> 00:33:39.718 region:rollup2
BUT IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN

00:33:38.250 --> 00:33:40.919 region:rollup2
THAT ACTED NEGLIGENTLY AND THEIR

00:33:39.718 --> 00:33:42.087 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF OTHER FACTORS OF THE

00:33:40.919 --> 00:33:44.556 region:rollup2
OTHER JURY INSTRUCTIONS BUT THAT

00:33:42.087 --> 00:33:47.759 region:rollup2
IS ONE OF THEM.

00:33:44.556 --> 00:33:50.195 region:rollup2
DOES THE UTILITY HAVE THE RIGHT

00:33:47.759 --> 00:33:52.597 region:rollup2
TO ASK --

00:33:50.195 --> 00:33:53.398 region:rollup2
FOR INDEMNIFICATION IF THEY KNOW

00:33:52.597 --> 00:33:55.033 region:rollup2
THAT SOMEONE ELSE WAS

00:33:53.398 --> 00:33:58.303 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBLE CAN THEY ALSO TAKE

00:33:55.033 --> 00:33:59.604 region:rollup2
ACTION AGAINST A THIRD PARTY.

00:33:58.303 --> 00:34:00.872 region:rollup2
I BELIEVE THE PANELISTS

00:33:59.604 --> 00:34:02.574 region:rollup2
MUTILATES CAN SPEAK TO THIS

00:34:00.872 --> 00:34:03.375 region:rollup2
BETTER THAN I CAN BUT IT'S MY

00:34:02.574 --> 00:34:05.043 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING THAT FOR EXAMPLE

00:34:03.375 --> 00:34:06.711 region:rollup2
WITH THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS

00:34:05.043 --> 00:34:08.179 region:rollup2
COMPANIES THAT ARE ON THE POLLS.

00:34:06.711 --> 00:34:10.548 region:rollup2
BUT THEY HAVE INDEMNIFICATION

00:34:08.179 --> 00:34:12.317 region:rollup2
AGREEMENTS BUT THAT'S SUBJECT TO

00:34:10.548 --> 00:34:13.885 region:rollup2
VERIFICATION WOULD BE HAPPY TO

00:34:12.317 --> 00:34:14.853 region:rollup2
FOLLOW AT YOUR OFFICE ON THAT

00:34:13.885 --> 00:34:16.187 region:rollup2
AND TO CONFIRM THAT.

00:34:14.853 --> 00:34:18.089 region:rollup2
AND THE REASON IT'S

00:34:16.187 --> 00:34:19.424 region:rollup2
INDEMNIFICATION IS BECAUSE I

00:34:18.089 --> 00:34:20.025 region:rollup2
ASSUME.

00:34:19.424 --> 00:34:23.361 region:rollup2
THAT THEY HAVE A CONTRACT WITH

00:34:20.025 --> 00:34:24.796 region:rollup2
THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS PARTY IS.

00:34:23.361 --> 00:34:26.932 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S A CONTRACTUAL

00:34:24.796 --> 00:34:28.400 region:rollup2
RELATIONSHIP AND IF THEY HAVE A

00:34:26.932 --> 00:34:29.634 region:rollup2
CONTRACT AND THAT PERSON WAS

00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:30.635 region:rollup2
WITH THAT ENTITY RECEIPT WAS

00:34:29.634 --> 00:34:31.870 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBLE.

00:34:30.635 --> 00:34:33.471 region:rollup2
THEY CAN THEN SEEK

00:34:31.870 --> 00:34:34.372 region:rollup2
INDEMNIFICATION FROM THEM RIGHT

00:34:33.471 --> 00:34:36.141 region:rollup2
AGAIN THAT'S THAT'S MY

00:34:34.372 --> 00:34:37.208 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING SUBJECT TO BEAR

00:34:36.141 --> 00:34:37.842 region:rollup2
FIND THAT OBVIOUSLY WE'RE

00:34:37.208 --> 00:34:39.911 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT SPECIFIC CONTRACTS

00:34:37.842 --> 00:34:41.780 region:rollup2
--

00:34:39.911 --> 00:34:43.682 region:rollup2
THAT MADE ME DIFFERENT SOME

00:34:41.780 --> 00:34:45.817 region:rollup2
MATERIAL WAYS.

00:34:43.682 --> 00:34:48.153 region:rollup2
AND THEN FINALLY.

00:34:45.817 --> 00:34:50.188 region:rollup2
IF THIS BODY WERE DO DO ANYTHING

00:34:48.153 --> 00:34:51.189 region:rollup2
REGARDING INVERSE CONDEMNATION

00:34:50.188 --> 00:34:52.424 region:rollup2
CLEARLY AND GIVE HEARD FROM THE

00:34:51.189 --> 00:34:54.659 region:rollup2
GET SENATOR REGARDING THE

00:34:52.424 --> 00:34:56.161 region:rollup2
CONSTITUTIONALITY OR QUESTIONS

00:34:54.659 --> 00:34:57.963 region:rollup2
REGARDING CONSTITUTIONALITY.

00:34:56.161 --> 00:34:58.830 region:rollup2
WOULD YOU AGREE THAT THIS WOULD

00:34:57.963 --> 00:35:01.366 region:rollup2
BE.

00:34:58.830 --> 00:35:04.369 region:rollup2
IN LITIGATION FOR YEARS PERHAPS

00:35:01.366 --> 00:35:06.738 region:rollup2
DECADES.

00:35:04.369 --> 00:35:07.372 region:rollup2
WELL I I OF COURSE CAN'T

00:35:06.738 --> 00:35:09.407 region:rollup2
SPECULATE HOW THE COURTS WILL

00:35:07.372 --> 00:35:11.076 region:rollup2
TREAT THIS BUT I HAVE REASON TO

00:35:09.407 --> 00:35:12.410 region:rollup2
BELIEVE BECAUSE IT'S SUCH A

00:35:11.076 --> 00:35:13.878 region:rollup2
HOTLY DEBATED QUESTION THAT

00:35:12.410 --> 00:35:15.280 region:rollup2
LIKELY MAKE IT MAKE ITS WAY TO

00:35:13.878 --> 00:35:17.515 region:rollup2
THE COURT.

00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:18.850 region:rollup2
AND THE COURTS WOULD BE FACED

00:35:17.515 --> 00:35:20.685 region:rollup2
WITH THE QUESTION --

00:35:18.850 --> 00:35:21.620 region:rollup2
SOONER RATHER THAN LATER BY I

00:35:20.685 --> 00:35:23.355 region:rollup2
CAN'T SPECULATE AS TO THE

00:35:21.620 --> 00:35:23.989 region:rollup2
TIMELINESS TO WIN THE CALIFORNIA

00:35:23.355 --> 00:35:24.689 region:rollup2
SUPREME COURT WOULD ADDRESS THIS

00:35:23.989 --> 00:35:27.225 region:rollup2
ISSUE [inaudible]

00:35:24.689 --> 00:35:30.662 region:rollup2
THANK YOU --

00:35:27.225 --> 00:35:30.662 region:rollup2
CENTER CAN HELP [inaudible]

00:35:30.729 --> 00:35:34.299 region:rollup2
THINGS CHAIRMAN SO.

00:35:32.664 --> 00:35:35.600 region:rollup2
I HESITATE TO PUT MY TOE IN THE

00:35:34.299 --> 00:35:37.268 region:rollup2
WATER IF THE ATTORNEYS HAVE

00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:38.870 region:rollup2
SPOKE BUT A SO THE CONSTITUTION

00:35:37.268 --> 00:35:40.572 region:rollup2
DOES IT.

00:35:38.870 --> 00:35:41.740 region:rollup2
DIFFERENTIATE FLOOD CONTROL

00:35:40.572 --> 00:35:44.142 region:rollup2
DISTRICT'S VERSES UTILITY

00:35:41.740 --> 00:35:46.311 region:rollup2
COMPANIES.

00:35:44.142 --> 00:35:47.178 region:rollup2
BUT NO DE NEITHER OF THEM ARE

00:35:46.311 --> 00:35:49.014 region:rollup2
DISCUSSED IN THE CONSTANT COULD

00:35:47.178 --> 00:35:50.615 region:rollup2
SO.

00:35:49.014 --> 00:35:52.283 region:rollup2
HOW CAN WE DIFFERENTIATE THEM

00:35:50.615 --> 00:35:54.919 region:rollup2
OUT WHY CAN A COURT?

00:35:52.283 --> 00:35:55.820 region:rollup2
AND MAKE A DECISION ON ONE AND

00:35:54.919 --> 00:35:57.522 region:rollup2
NOT THE OTHER WHAT HOW HOW DOES

00:35:55.820 --> 00:35:58.456 region:rollup2
THAT WORK.

00:35:57.522 --> 00:36:00.392 region:rollup2
WELL THE THE CASES WHICH I

00:35:58.456 --> 00:36:01.793 region:rollup2
REFERENCE.

00:36:00.392 --> 00:36:03.828 region:rollup2
RELY ON PUBLIC POLICY

00:36:01.793 --> 00:36:05.263 region:rollup2
DISTINCTIONS AND THEY MAKE AN

00:36:03.828 --> 00:36:07.632 region:rollup2
ARGUMENT THAT THE FLOOD CONTROL

00:36:05.263 --> 00:36:10.235 region:rollup2
DISTRICT SO UNIQUELY SITUATED.

00:36:07.632 --> 00:36:11.269 region:rollup2
AND SOCIETY BECAUSE OF THE THE

00:36:10.235 --> 00:36:12.537 region:rollup2
THE RISKY ACTIVITY THAT THEY

00:36:11.269 --> 00:36:14.039 region:rollup2
UNDERTAKE.

00:36:12.537 --> 00:36:15.774 region:rollup2
THE BENEFIT THAT THEY PROVIDE

00:36:14.039 --> 00:36:17.742 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S THE REASON CITED.

00:36:15.774 --> 00:36:19.711 region:rollup2
SO IF I WAS MY UNDERSTANDING

00:36:17.742 --> 00:36:22.547 region:rollup2
THAT THE REASON THIS STRIP CLUB

00:36:19.711 --> 00:36:24.482 region:rollup2
BILL OR INVERSE CONDEMNATION.

00:36:22.547 --> 00:36:26.084 region:rollup2
IS USE IS BECAUSE UTILITY

00:36:24.482 --> 00:36:27.786 region:rollup2
COMPANIES ARE OF PSEUDO

00:36:26.084 --> 00:36:29.054 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES THAT CAN

00:36:27.786 --> 00:36:30.689 region:rollup2
TAKE PROPERTY THROUGH A IN THE

00:36:29.054 --> 00:36:32.824 region:rollup2
DOMAIN.

00:36:30.689 --> 00:36:34.559 region:rollup2
IS THAT THE TRIGGER TO APPLY

00:36:32.824 --> 00:36:34.559 region:rollup2
STRICT LIABILITY OR INVERSE

00:36:34.793 --> 00:36:36.661 region:rollup2
CONDEMNATION.

00:36:36.728 --> 00:36:39.597 region:rollup2
THE OTHER ONE WAS THAT THEY'RE

00:36:37.929 --> 00:36:42.534 region:rollup2
ABLE TO PASS ON THE COST THE

00:36:39.597 --> 00:36:43.768 region:rollup2
RATES AND THAT THE COURTS DIDN'T

00:36:42.534 --> 00:36:46.271 region:rollup2
CHIP IT DIDN'T DISCUSS THE FACT

00:36:43.768 --> 00:36:47.639 region:rollup2
IT THAT QUESTION IS SUBJECT TO

00:36:46.271 --> 00:36:50.308 region:rollup2
REASONABLENESS REVIEW.

00:36:47.639 --> 00:36:51.443 region:rollup2
AT THE CPUC AND SO AS SOON THAT

00:36:50.308 --> 00:36:53.078 region:rollup2
THE COST WOULD AUTOMATICALLY GO

00:36:51.443 --> 00:36:54.045 region:rollup2
AND RATES.

00:36:53.078 --> 00:36:55.713 region:rollup2
THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY THE CASE

00:36:54.045 --> 00:36:56.915 region:rollup2
THOUGH RIGHT SEEMS LIKE LOTS OF

00:36:55.713 --> 00:36:58.416 region:rollup2
TIMES UTILITY COMPANIES ARE OR

00:36:56.915 --> 00:36:59.751 region:rollup2
WILL THEY HAVE TO TO PAY THE

00:36:58.416 --> 00:37:01.286 region:rollup2
DAMAGES.

00:36:59.751 --> 00:37:02.487 region:rollup2
AND SO THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL

00:37:01.286 --> 00:37:04.222 region:rollup2
IF THEY'RE NEGLIGIBLE THEY'LL

00:37:02.487 --> 00:37:05.790 region:rollup2
PAY BUT AS I UNDERSTAND IT NOW

00:37:04.222 --> 00:37:07.425 region:rollup2
WITH THE THE STRICT LIABILITY OR

00:37:05.790 --> 00:37:08.960 region:rollup2
AN INVERSE COME NATION.

00:37:07.425 --> 00:37:11.062 region:rollup2
IF THERE IS A POLL THAT MEETS

00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:11.696 region:rollup2
EVERY PROPER STANDARDS BEEN YOU

00:37:11.062 --> 00:37:13.231 region:rollup2
KNOW.

00:37:11.696 --> 00:37:15.133 region:rollup2
LOOK AT BY THE FEW SEATS A

00:37:13.231 --> 00:37:16.301 region:rollup2
PERFECT CONDITION AND A TRUCK

00:37:15.133 --> 00:37:17.902 region:rollup2
HITS THE POLL.

00:37:16.301 --> 00:37:20.038 region:rollup2
KNOCKS THE LINES DOWN STARTS A

00:37:17.902 --> 00:37:21.206 region:rollup2
FIRE THE CREATES BILLIONS OF

00:37:20.038 --> 00:37:22.507 region:rollup2
DOLLARS IN DAMAGE OBVIOUSLY THE

00:37:21.206 --> 00:37:24.442 region:rollup2
PERSON DRIVING THE TRUCK CAN'T

00:37:22.507 --> 00:37:25.376 region:rollup2
AFFORD OF CLAIM DOT PAY THOSE

00:37:24.442 --> 00:37:26.311 region:rollup2
CLAIMS.

00:37:25.376 --> 00:37:27.779 region:rollup2
IS THAT NGUYEN STRICKLAND

00:37:26.311 --> 00:37:29.481 region:rollup2
ABILITY OR INVERSE CONDITIONAL

00:37:27.779 --> 00:37:31.015 region:rollup2
COME IN AND BE.

00:37:29.481 --> 00:37:32.317 region:rollup2
THE UTIL COMPOSE BEHELD THE PAY.

00:37:31.015 --> 00:37:34.319 region:rollup2
I I'M RELUCTANT TO TALK ABOUT

00:37:32.317 --> 00:37:36.554 region:rollup2
SPECIFIC HYPOTHETICALS BUT YES I

00:37:34.319 --> 00:37:39.491 region:rollup2
BELIEVE THAT THAT THAT'S COULD

00:37:36.554 --> 00:37:40.792 region:rollup2
BE AN EXAMPLE OF WHEN A UTILITY.

00:37:39.491 --> 00:37:41.359 region:rollup2
TO NOT AT NIGHT WITH NEGLIGENTLY

00:37:40.792 --> 00:37:43.161 region:rollup2
BUT THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE IS

00:37:41.359 --> 00:37:45.330 region:rollup2
GONE.

00:37:43.161 --> 00:37:45.930 region:rollup2
SOMEHOW IMPLICATED IN A FIRE IF

00:37:45.330 --> 00:37:48.133 region:rollup2
THEY'RE THEY'RE 1% RESPONSIBLE

00:37:45.930 --> 00:37:50.568 region:rollup2
--

00:37:48.133 --> 00:37:52.604 region:rollup2
THEY WOULD INCUR A 100% OF THE

00:37:50.568 --> 00:37:53.571 region:rollup2
OBLIGATION CORRECT I BELIEVE YOU

00:37:52.604 --> 00:37:55.440 region:rollup2
HAVE A CORRECT UNDERSTANDING YES

00:37:53.571 --> 00:37:59.277 region:rollup2
OKAY THANK YOU.

00:37:55.440 --> 00:38:00.111 region:rollup2
ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD.

00:37:59.277 --> 00:38:01.813 region:rollup2
THANK YOU THANK YOU I'M DEATHLY

00:38:00.111 --> 00:38:02.280 region:rollup2
NON ATTORNEY SO MY QUESTIONS ARE

00:38:01.813 --> 00:38:05.316 region:rollup2
A LITTLE DIFFERENT --

00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:06.417 region:rollup2
LOOKING --

00:38:05.316 --> 00:38:06.718 region:rollup2
FLOOD CONTROL DISTRICT'S

00:38:06.417 --> 00:38:08.419 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

00:38:06.718 --> 00:38:09.587 region:rollup2
ARE.

00:38:08.419 --> 00:38:12.157 region:rollup2
PUTTING INFRASTRUCTURE TO

00:38:09.587 --> 00:38:14.726 region:rollup2
MITIGATE DISASTERS.

00:38:12.157 --> 00:38:16.728 region:rollup2
UTILITIES COULD IN [inaudible]

00:38:14.726 --> 00:38:19.130 region:rollup2
STRUCTURES THAT POTENTIALLY

00:38:16.728 --> 00:38:19.564 region:rollup2
CREATE DISASTERS [inaudible]

00:38:19.130 --> 00:38:21.1000 region:rollup2
THROUGH [inaudible]

00:38:19.564 --> 00:38:22.734 region:rollup2
WHATEVER.

00:38:21.1000 --> 00:38:24.903 region:rollup2
I'M HAVING A HARD TIME

00:38:22.734 --> 00:38:27.739 region:rollup2
RECONCILING WHY WE WOULD WANT TO

00:38:24.903 --> 00:38:29.240 region:rollup2
BASE POLICY ON ONE MAN I FIND

00:38:27.739 --> 00:38:31.009 region:rollup2
THEM VERY VERY DIFFERENT.

00:38:29.240 --> 00:38:32.944 region:rollup2
CAN NUKES GIVE ME SOME LOGICAL

00:38:31.009 --> 00:38:34.345 region:rollup2
EXPLANATION.

00:38:32.944 --> 00:38:36.247 region:rollup2
WELL I THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT

00:38:34.345 --> 00:38:37.715 region:rollup2
DISTINCTION BUT I ALSO THINK

00:38:36.247 --> 00:38:38.750 region:rollup2
THAT THERE SIMILAR IN THAT THEIR

00:38:37.715 --> 00:38:39.818 region:rollup2
BOATS --

00:38:38.750 --> 00:38:42.353 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE TO PROVIDE GREAT

00:38:39.818 --> 00:38:44.122 region:rollup2
BENEFITS WITH WITH RISK.

00:38:42.353 --> 00:38:47.625 region:rollup2
AND SO I THINK YOU'VE PUT.

00:38:44.122 --> 00:38:49.093 region:rollup2
YOUR FINGER ON A POTENTIAL

00:38:47.625 --> 00:38:50.361 region:rollup2
DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE TWO AND

00:38:49.093 --> 00:38:51.095 region:rollup2
LIKE I SAID EARLIER I'M NOT

00:38:50.361 --> 00:38:54.899 region:rollup2
SAYING THEY'RE THE SAME.

00:38:51.095 --> 00:38:57.302 region:rollup2
BUT THEY'RE SIMILAR.

00:38:54.899 --> 00:38:59.103 region:rollup2
HE HAD DONE DOESN'T FEEL THAT

00:38:57.302 --> 00:39:01.439 region:rollup2
SIMILAR TO ME I GUESS.

00:38:59.103 --> 00:39:02.807 region:rollup2
I'M JUST JUST SAM PHAM.

00:39:01.439 --> 00:39:04.509 region:rollup2
CONSIDERING THE LEGAL BATTLES

00:39:02.807 --> 00:39:06.344 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:39:04.509 --> 00:39:07.812 region:rollup2
IF WE MAKE A DECISION HERE.

00:39:06.344 --> 00:39:08.680 region:rollup2
AND BUT THEN I BECAUSE I'VE

00:39:07.812 --> 00:39:10.014 region:rollup2
HEARD FROM A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT

00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:12.083 region:rollup2
THERE'S A BIG QUESTIONS ABOUT

00:39:10.014 --> 00:39:15.553 region:rollup2
THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF DOING

00:39:12.083 --> 00:39:18.256 region:rollup2
ANY ANY CHANGES HERE --

00:39:15.553 --> 00:39:18.756 region:rollup2
WHAT ASSURE YOU WOULD THAT MEAN

00:39:18.256 --> 00:39:20.625 region:rollup2
FOR US TRYING TO PROTECT

00:39:18.756 --> 00:39:22.360 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA?

00:39:20.625 --> 00:39:23.895 region:rollup2
THESE WILD FIRE MITIGATION PLANS

00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:26.130 region:rollup2
THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO BE DRAWN UP

00:39:23.895 --> 00:39:26.798 region:rollup2
AND UP SUPERVISED BY THE P. YOU

00:39:26.130 --> 00:39:27.799 region:rollup2
SEE.

00:39:26.798 --> 00:39:29.300 region:rollup2
THAT THE LANGUAGE IS PRETTY

00:39:27.799 --> 00:39:30.335 region:rollup2
LOOSE IN THERE FROM MY

00:39:29.300 --> 00:39:31.769 region:rollup2
PERSPECTIVE.

00:39:30.335 --> 00:39:33.371 region:rollup2
IS COUNTY YOU GOT A TIME FRAME

00:39:31.769 --> 00:39:36.040 region:rollup2
BUT YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO STRIVE

00:39:33.371 --> 00:39:37.475 region:rollup2
FOR THAT --

00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:40.411 region:rollup2
ONCE THE PLANS IN IT BEEN

00:39:37.475 --> 00:39:41.913 region:rollup2
APPROVED YOU'VE GOT A TIME FRAME

00:39:40.411 --> 00:39:44.082 region:rollup2
FOR THAT THEY'LL BE YOU KNOW

00:39:41.913 --> 00:39:45.283 region:rollup2
EXECS AND THE NATION'S --

00:39:44.082 --> 00:39:48.286 region:rollup2
THE EFFICACY OF THAT WE HAVE TO

00:39:45.283 --> 00:39:49.587 region:rollup2
STRIVE FOR THAT --

00:39:48.286 --> 00:39:52.724 region:rollup2
UNDER THE NOSE BUT THERE'S WHAT

00:39:49.587 --> 00:39:53.825 region:rollup2
SMOKE IN THE AIR. TEN STRIVING

00:39:52.724 --> 00:39:54.859 region:rollup2
FOR SOMETHING.

00:39:53.825 --> 00:39:56.728 region:rollup2
ISN'T GOING TO BE GOOD ENOUGH

00:39:54.859 --> 00:39:58.129 region:rollup2
FOR SOME OF US.

00:39:56.728 --> 00:39:59.731 region:rollup2
WE'RE GONNA BE LOOKING FOR HARD

00:39:58.129 --> 00:40:02.367 region:rollup2
DEADLINES.

00:39:59.731 --> 00:40:03.468 region:rollup2
AND REAL RESULTS.

00:40:02.367 --> 00:40:05.436 region:rollup2
SO THAT WE CAN ASSURE OUR

00:40:03.468 --> 00:40:07.005 region:rollup2
CONSTITUENTS THAT THAT WE ARE

00:40:05.436 --> 00:40:07.572 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY DOING YOU KNOW WHAT

00:40:07.005 --> 00:40:08.406 region:rollup2
THAT WERE ACTUALLY MOVING

00:40:07.572 --> 00:40:10.008 region:rollup2
FORWARD HERE.

00:40:08.406 --> 00:40:11.709 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I JUST FOR SEE IN

00:40:10.008 --> 00:40:13.144 region:rollup2
ADDITION OF LEGAL BATTLES HAS

00:40:11.709 --> 00:40:14.846 region:rollup2
SOME THESE MITIGATION PLANS TAKE

00:40:13.144 --> 00:40:16.281 region:rollup2
YEARS TO DEVELOP.

00:40:14.846 --> 00:40:17.815 region:rollup2
YEARS TO IMPLEMENT.

00:40:16.281 --> 00:40:19.617 region:rollup2
AND IN MEANTIME MILLIONS AND

00:40:17.815 --> 00:40:19.918 region:rollup2
MILLIONS MORE ACRES ACRES A

00:40:19.617 --> 00:40:21.552 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

00:40:19.918 --> 00:40:23.521 region:rollup2
BURNT.

00:40:21.552 --> 00:40:24.789 region:rollup2
AND MORE PEOPLE DIE.

00:40:23.521 --> 00:40:25.623 region:rollup2
AND WERE AND WE'RE NOT ANY

00:40:24.789 --> 00:40:27.292 region:rollup2
CLOSER TO THAT.

00:40:25.623 --> 00:40:28.960 region:rollup2
AND SO.

00:40:27.292 --> 00:40:30.461 region:rollup2
I ALSO HAVE A QUESTION AND YOU

00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:32.297 region:rollup2
MAY A BILL ANSWER THIS --

00:40:30.461 --> 00:40:34.465 region:rollup2
BUT I AM PUZZLED AS PUZZLE ME

00:40:32.297 --> 00:40:35.033 region:rollup2

EIGHTEEN WHY IS THAT DATE THERE

00:40:43.274 --> 00:40:47.512 region:rollup2
WHY SHOULDN'T WE BE LOOKING AT

00:40:45.710 --> 00:40:49.380 region:rollup2
GOING FORWARD WHY SHOULDN'T THIS

00:40:47.512 --> 00:40:52.150 region:rollup2

PLANS ARE IN PLACE. FOR PEOPLE.

00:40:52.150 --> 00:40:55.119 region:rollup2
FOR THE UTILITIES AFTER THEY'VE

00:40:53.785 --> 00:40:56.521 region:rollup2
BEEN AFTER THEY'VE BEEN

00:40:55.119 --> 00:40:58.022 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATED TO BE SURE THERE

00:40:56.521 --> 00:41:00.024 region:rollup2
ADEQUATE WHY SHOULD WE GO

00:40:58.022 --> 00:41:01.159 region:rollup2
RETROACTIVELY WE DON'T EVEN KNOW

00:41:00.024 --> 00:41:02.860 region:rollup2

00:41:21.412 --> 00:41:26.017 region:rollup2
FURTHER [inaudible]

00:41:23.514 --> 00:41:27.518 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL UTILITY.

00:41:26.017 --> 00:41:28.119 region:rollup2
PROBLEMS OUT THERE THE COULD

00:41:27.518 --> 00:41:29.354 region:rollup2
CONTRIBUTE TO ADDITIONAL FIRE

00:41:28.119 --> 00:41:31.956 region:rollup2
SO.

00:41:29.354 --> 00:41:33.624 region:rollup2
SO EXPLAIN TO ME THE LOGIC WHY

00:41:31.956 --> 00:41:34.959 region:rollup2
WE WOULD DO SOMETHING THAT SAYS

00:41:33.624 --> 00:41:36.160 region:rollup2

EIGHTEEN WE DON'T EVEN HAVE

00:41:36.160 --> 00:41:38.663 region:rollup2
ANYWAY TO MITIGATE.

00:41:37.628 --> 00:41:40.298 region:rollup2
THE POTENTIAL FUTURE FUTURE

00:41:38.663 --> 00:41:41.999 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES.

00:41:40.298 --> 00:41:43.901 region:rollup2
BUT IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT

00:41:41.999 --> 00:41:46.004 region:rollup2
THAT DATE WAS ELECTED TO

00:41:43.901 --> 00:41:47.672 region:rollup2
PRECLUDE THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN

AT ON THE TEAM IT --

00:41:56.114 --> 00:42:01.586 region:rollup2
I I DON'T NECESSARILY BELIEVE IS

00:41:57.582 --> 00:42:03.087 region:rollup2
A ABSOLUTE MUST DATE COULD BE A

00:42:01.586 --> 00:42:04.956 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT DATES FOR THE WILL OF

00:42:03.087 --> 00:42:06.691 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATURE TO THE SIDE.

00:42:04.956 --> 00:42:08.493 region:rollup2

00:42:06.691 --> 00:42:08.793 region:rollup2
IS FOR YOU TO CONSIDER

00:42:08.493 --> 00:42:13.464 region:rollup2

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN REAL

00:42:15.333 --> 00:42:18.002 region:rollup2
QUICK QUESTION SO THE ONE THING

00:42:16.768 --> 00:42:19.670 region:rollup2
I PICKED UP ON IN YOUR COMMENTS

00:42:18.002 --> 00:42:21.773 region:rollup2
WAS.

00:42:19.670 --> 00:42:23.174 region:rollup2
THE THAT THERE'S A DECISION MADE

00:42:21.773 --> 00:42:25.143 region:rollup2
AT SOME POINT ABOUT.

00:42:23.174 --> 00:42:27.345 region:rollup2
WHO PAYS THE RIGHT PAIR FOR THE

00:42:25.143 --> 00:42:29.180 region:rollup2
INVESTOR?

00:42:27.345 --> 00:42:30.615 region:rollup2
AND BUT WHAT I REALLY HEARD WAS

00:42:29.180 --> 00:42:32.216 region:rollup2
THAT AT THE END THE RIGHT PAIR

00:42:30.615 --> 00:42:33.451 region:rollup2
PICKS UP THE COST BECAUSE IF

00:42:32.216 --> 00:42:34.952 region:rollup2
THEY CAN'T BORROW MONEY SO WHO

00:42:33.451 --> 00:42:36.220 region:rollup2
MAKES THAT DETERMINATION.

00:42:34.952 --> 00:42:38.623 region:rollup2
AND HOW IS THAT IN THE PROCESS

00:42:36.220 --> 00:42:40.224 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I THINK. ONE OF THE KEY

00:42:38.623 --> 00:42:41.692 region:rollup2
THINGS IN THIS WHOLE FROM SINCE

YOU KNOW I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THE

00:42:43.828 --> 00:42:46.664 region:rollup2
RIGHT PAIR.

00:42:45.163 --> 00:42:48.566 region:rollup2
NOT ONLY THE RIGHT PAIR BUT THE

00:42:46.664 --> 00:42:49.167 region:rollup2
INSURER AT THE SAME TIME BECAUSE

00:42:48.566 --> 00:42:50.668 region:rollup2

CARE OF THEIR SELVES HERE BUT

00:42:55.873 --> 00:42:58.543 region:rollup2
THE RATE PARRIS THE GUYS ON THE

00:42:57.175 --> 00:42:59.110 region:rollup2
HOOK EVERY SINGLE TIME SEEMS

00:42:58.543 --> 00:43:00.578 region:rollup2
LIKE SO.

00:42:59.110 --> 00:43:04.148 region:rollup2

EXCUSE ME LET ME REPHRASE THAT

00:43:10.021 --> 00:43:13.524 region:rollup2
THE DECISION OF WHETHER NOT TO

VAN THAT AT ISSUE [inaudible]

00:43:18.362 --> 00:43:23.634 region:rollup2
ON THERE'S AN EVALUATION THEIR

00:43:21.132 --> 00:43:25.136 region:rollup2
CONDUCT REGARDLESS OF THE

00:43:23.634 --> 00:43:26.537 region:rollup2
IMPLICATION HAS TO INSURANCE

00:43:30.007 --> 00:43:34.479 region:rollup2
OUR PREVIOUS DECISION THIS PAST

YEAR AS WE ALL KNOW BECAUSE A

00:43:34.479 --> 00:43:39.150 region:rollup2
LOT OF DISCUSSION AFTERWARDS.

00:43:37.415 --> 00:43:41.285 region:rollup2
ON BECAUSE THAT DECISION WAS

00:43:39.150 --> 00:43:41.886 region:rollup2
FOCUSED JUST ON THE THE FACTS

00:43:41.285 --> 00:43:44.755 region:rollup2
THAT DAY AND AND THOSE DECIDED

00:43:41.886 --> 00:43:46.357 region:rollup2

BASED OFF THOSE FACTS AND EACH

00:43:46.357 --> 00:43:48.526 region:rollup2
OF THESE CASES ARE FOR FOR OUR

00:43:47.992 --> 00:43:50.461 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT AND BASED ON THE

FACTS.

00:43:50.461 --> 00:43:54.999 region:rollup2
IS NOT A CONSIDERATION OF THE

THE REPORTS TAX IF YOU WILL AND

00:43:54.999 --> 00:43:58.436 region:rollup2

00:43:56.634 --> 00:44:00.138 region:rollup2
REDACTED THEN TAX RATE HERE'S

00:43:58.436 --> 00:44:02.206 region:rollup2
OUR ANYWAY NOT SIGNIFICANT.

00:44:00.138 --> 00:44:03.441 region:rollup2
BUT THE VALUATION IS OF WHETHER

00:44:02.206 --> 00:44:05.376 region:rollup2
NOT TO UTILITY CONDUCTING

00:44:03.441 --> 00:44:07.144 region:rollup2
THEMSELVES IN A PRUDENT WAY AND

00:44:05.376 --> 00:44:10.948 region:rollup2

THAT WERE CAUSED BY UTILITIES.

00:48:02.546 --> 00:48:05.916 region:rollup2
THIS IS HOW WE REBUILD OUR

00:48:03.481 --> 00:48:07.418 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES.

00:48:05.916 --> 00:48:09.153 region:rollup2
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ALREADY ARE

00:48:07.418 --> 00:48:10.521 region:rollup2
FACED WITH SIGNIFICANT COSTS AND

00:48:09.153 --> 00:48:12.690 region:rollup2

00:48:20.798 --> 00:48:23.868 region:rollup2
PROPOSALS TO CHANGE INVERSE

00:48:22.133 --> 00:48:26.403 region:rollup2
CONDEMNATION RULES OPEN THE DOOR

00:48:23.868 --> 00:48:28.472 region:rollup2
TO ALLOW UTILITIES TO PASS OFF

00:48:26.403 --> 00:48:29.907 region:rollup2

IF WE CAN REBUILD OUR BILL THE

IT WAS ONLY MONTHS AGO THAT WE

IN THE NORTH BAY WERE RAVAGED BY

00:50:16.080 --> 00:50:18.782 region:rollup2

00:50:17.014 --> 00:50:20.517 region:rollup2
THE TYPES FIRE STARTED WITHIN A

00:50:18.782 --> 00:50:22.720 region:rollup2

IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN ALONE WILD

FIRES ARE CONTINUING TO BURNING

00:50:35.332 --> 00:50:38.135 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA'S WE ALL KNOW AS WE

SIT HERE.

00:50:38.135 --> 00:50:41.372 region:rollup2
AND WE MUST REMEMBER THAT ANY

00:50:39.770 --> 00:50:42.907 region:rollup2
CHANGES THAT WE MAKE TO LAWS

00:50:41.372 --> 00:50:45.409 region:rollup2
TODAY.

00:50:42.907 --> 00:50:46.477 region:rollup2
WHAT IMPACT FUTURE FIRE VICTIMS

00:50:45.409 --> 00:50:48.779 region:rollup2
AND WE WILL HAVE FUTURE FIRE

00:50:46.477 --> 00:50:49.880 region:rollup2
VICTIMS?

00:50:48.779 --> 00:50:51.181 region:rollup2
IT MAY IMPACT CURRENT FIRE

00:50:49.880 --> 00:50:52.950 region:rollup2
VICTIMS IF THAT DATE ISN'T

00:50:51.181 --> 00:50:55.486 region:rollup2
CHANGED.

00:50:52.950 --> 00:50:56.253 region:rollup2
C. SACKS STRONGLY BELIEVES THAT

00:50:55.486 --> 00:50:58.188 region:rollup2
THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IS

00:50:56.253 --> 00:51:00.090 region:rollup2
UNCONSTITUTIONAL.

00:50:58.188 --> 00:51:01.659 region:rollup2
IN ADDITION WE BELIEVE THAT THE

00:51:00.090 --> 00:51:04.161 region:rollup2
CURRENT LEGAL STANDARD IS

00:51:01.659 --> 00:51:05.896 region:rollup2
CRITICAL TO COMPEL UTILITIES TO

00:51:04.161 --> 00:51:07.464 region:rollup2
INVEST IN SAFETY.

00:51:05.896 --> 00:51:09.800 region:rollup2
SAFETY NEEDS TO BE OUR MAIN

00:51:07.464 --> 00:51:11.568 region:rollup2
FOCUS WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT

00:51:09.800 --> 00:51:13.404 region:rollup2
PREVENTION.

00:51:11.568 --> 00:51:15.339 region:rollup2
SAFETY AND ACCOUNTABILITY FOR

00:51:13.404 --> 00:51:16.507 region:rollup2
UTILITIES.

00:51:15.339 --> 00:51:17.975 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO FOCUS ON FOREST

00:51:16.507 --> 00:51:20.411 region:rollup2
HEALTH.

00:51:17.975 --> 00:51:23.347 region:rollup2
RESILIENCY AND LAND USE

00:51:20.411 --> 00:51:25.182 region:rollup2
WE DO NOT NEED TO BE FOCUSING ON

00:51:23.347 --> 00:51:25.683 region:rollup2
CHANGING LONGSTANDING LIABILITY

00:51:25.182 --> 00:51:29.420 region:rollup2
LAWS THAT HAVE PROTECTED

00:51:25.683 --> 00:51:31.322 region:rollup2
VICTIMS.

00:51:29.420 --> 00:51:32.323 region:rollup2
NAPA COUNTY MAY NOT BE ON FIRE

00:51:31.322 --> 00:51:34.892 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW.

00:51:32.323 --> 00:51:36.627 region:rollup2
BUT UNFORTUNATELY IT'S A HARM

00:51:34.892 --> 00:51:38.395 region:rollup2
PROBABLY WILL BE AT SOME POINT

00:51:36.627 --> 00:51:39.997 region:rollup2
AND THIS PROPOSAL WOULD

00:51:38.395 --> 00:51:41.532 region:rollup2
NEGATIVELY IMPACT.

00:51:39.997 --> 00:51:43.634 region:rollup2
FIRE VICTIMS IN THE FUTURE

00:51:41.532 --> 00:51:45.002 region:rollup2
LIMITING THEIR ABILITY TO FAIRLY

00:51:43.634 --> 00:51:47.938 region:rollup2
AND SWIFTLY BECOME BEEN SATED

00:51:45.002 --> 00:51:49.440 region:rollup2
FROM FIRES THAT UTILITIES COST.

00:51:47.938 --> 00:51:50.708 region:rollup2
THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL ASKED

00:51:49.440 --> 00:51:53.811 region:rollup2
THE COURT TO BALANCE THE BENEFIT

00:51:50.708 --> 00:51:56.280 region:rollup2
OF ELECTRICITY. TO SOMEONE'S

00:51:53.811 --> 00:51:58.315 region:rollup2
HOUSE BURNING DOWN.

00:51:56.280 --> 00:52:00.417 region:rollup2
HOW CAN THAT BE DONE HOW IS THAT

00:51:58.315 --> 00:52:02.152 region:rollup2
FAIR TO VICTIMS?

00:52:00.417 --> 00:52:04.588 region:rollup2
THIS IS A VERY RADICAL POLICY

00:52:02.152 --> 00:52:06.123 region:rollup2
CHANGE THIS PROPOSAL WILL SHIFT

00:52:04.588 --> 00:52:08.826 region:rollup2
LIABILITIES TO THE COMMUNITIES

00:52:06.123 --> 00:52:10.461 region:rollup2
THAT ARE TRYING TO RECOVER.

00:52:08.826 --> 00:52:12.262 region:rollup2
AND WHAT IS MOST GLARING.

00:52:10.461 --> 00:52:14.231 region:rollup2
IS THAT WE ARE DOING THIS IN

00:52:12.262 --> 00:52:15.399 region:rollup2
LIGHT OF THE FACT THAT THE IOUS

00:52:14.231 --> 00:52:16.967 region:rollup2
HAVE NOT BEEN MEETING THEIR

00:52:15.399 --> 00:52:18.802 region:rollup2
OBLIGATIONS.

00:52:16.967 --> 00:52:21.105 region:rollup2
TUESDAY NIGHT I HELD A MEETING

00:52:18.802 --> 00:52:21.772 region:rollup2
IN ANGLE AND THE COMMUNITY OF

00:52:21.105 --> 00:52:22.873 region:rollup2
THREE THOUSAND PEOPLE WHICH

00:52:21.772 --> 00:52:24.274 region:rollup2

AND TIER THREE THAT HASN'T

00:52:29.580 --> 00:52:32.616 region:rollup2
BURNED IN FIFTY YEARS THAT'S

00:52:30.748 --> 00:52:33.484 region:rollup2
VERY VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE

00:52:32.616 --> 00:52:35.386 region:rollup2
FUTURE.

00:52:33.484 --> 00:52:36.920 region:rollup2
AND I HELD THE MEETING TO FOCUS

00:52:35.386 --> 00:52:38.122 region:rollup2
ON PGA IN ME AND WHAT THEY'RE

00:52:36.920 --> 00:52:40.057 region:rollup2
DOING IN THE COMMUNITY THE ARE

00:52:38.122 --> 00:52:41.325 region:rollup2
TRYING DESPERATELY TO DO THE

00:52:40.057 --> 00:52:42.893 region:rollup2
WORK THAT THEY HAVE NOT DONE AND

00:52:41.325 --> 00:52:44.461 region:rollup2
SHOULD HAVE DONE FOR YEARS AND

00:52:42.893 --> 00:52:45.996 region:rollup2
YEARS AND YEARS.

00:52:44.461 --> 00:52:47.531 region:rollup2
HAPPY TO SEND YOU ALL PHOTOS OF

00:52:45.996 --> 00:52:49.266 region:rollup2
WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE ON THE GROUND

00:52:47.531 --> 00:52:51.602 region:rollup2
NOW.

00:52:49.266 --> 00:52:53.437 region:rollup2
AND WHAT THAT WILL MEAN IN TERMS

00:52:51.602 --> 00:52:54.772 region:rollup2
OF THIS POLICY CHANGE.

00:52:53.437 --> 00:52:56.006 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT IS VIRTUALLY

00:52:54.772 --> 00:52:57.708 region:rollup2
IMPOSSIBLE FOR THEM TO DO THE

00:52:56.006 --> 00:53:00.277 region:rollup2
WORK THAT THEY NEED TO DO RIGHT

00:52:57.708 --> 00:53:02.413 region:rollup2
NOW. TO MAKE IT SAFER.

00:53:00.277 --> 00:53:05.749 region:rollup2
AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CHANGING

00:53:02.413 --> 00:53:07.951 region:rollup2
THE WAY IN WHICH THEY'LL BE

00:53:05.749 --> 00:53:10.187 region:rollup2
JUDGED ON HAVING THAT HAVING MET

00:53:07.951 --> 00:53:11.955 region:rollup2
THEIR SAFETY REQUIREMENTS.

00:53:10.187 --> 00:53:13.624 region:rollup2
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS USE INVERSE

00:53:11.955 --> 00:53:15.459 region:rollup2
CONDEMNATION TO BRING A LARGE

00:53:13.624 --> 00:53:16.927 region:rollup2
WELL FUNDED UTILITIES TO THE

00:53:15.459 --> 00:53:18.429 region:rollup2
TABLE TO SETTLE FOR DAMAGES

00:53:16.927 --> 00:53:19.963 region:rollup2
RATHER THAN SPEND YEARS AND

00:53:18.429 --> 00:53:21.598 region:rollup2
YEARS IN COURT UNDER NEGLIGENCE

00:53:19.963 --> 00:53:23.100 region:rollup2
SUITS.

00:53:21.598 --> 00:53:25.302 region:rollup2
SMALL COUNTIES HAVE LIMITED

00:53:23.100 --> 00:53:26.236 region:rollup2
RESOURCES AND WE BRING UTILITIES

00:53:25.302 --> 00:53:28.439 region:rollup2
TO COURT UNDER INVERSE

00:53:26.236 --> 00:53:30.374 region:rollup2
CONDEMNATION EVEN WHEN THEY

00:53:28.439 --> 00:53:32.142 region:rollup2
ACTED NEGLIGENTLY BECAUSE IT

00:53:30.374 --> 00:53:33.043 region:rollup2
BRINGS THEM TO THE TABLE SOONER

00:53:32.142 --> 00:53:34.478 region:rollup2
FOR SETTLEMENT.

00:53:33.043 --> 00:53:36.046 region:rollup2
WE HAVE TO START PROVIDING

00:53:34.478 --> 00:53:37.181 region:rollup2
SERVICES WE HAVE TO PUT OUR

00:53:36.046 --> 00:53:37.481 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES BACK TOGETHER AGAIN

00:53:37.181 --> 00:53:40.117 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

00:53:37.481 --> 00:53:42.686 region:rollup2
AND WE HAVE TO BE IN COURT FOR

00:53:40.117 --> 00:53:44.354 region:rollup2
YEARS POTENTIALLY WITH THEM TO

00:53:42.686 --> 00:53:46.023 region:rollup2
BRING US TO SETTLEMENT ARM.

00:53:44.354 --> 00:53:47.591 region:rollup2
THAT'S THE CURRENT SITUATION

00:53:46.023 --> 00:53:51.328 region:rollup2
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TAKING AWAY

00:53:47.591 --> 00:53:53.997 region:rollup2
THAT INCENTIVE FOR THEM.

00:53:51.328 --> 00:53:55.733 region:rollup2
SO WE HAVEN'T SHOWN WHERE THE

00:53:53.997 --> 00:53:57.101 region:rollup2
INCENTIVE IS FOR PGM NEED TO

00:53:55.733 --> 00:53:58.602 region:rollup2
COME TO THE TABLE WHERE IS THE

00:53:57.101 --> 00:54:00.537 region:rollup2
INCENTIVE TO GET THEM TO GO TO

00:53:58.602 --> 00:54:02.740 region:rollup2
THAT HIGHER BAR THAT SAN DIEGO

00:54:00.537 --> 00:54:05.442 region:rollup2
HAS SHOWN CAN BE DONE.

00:54:02.740 --> 00:54:07.111 region:rollup2
I'M WE ARE SOLUTION ORIENTED.

00:54:05.442 --> 00:54:09.113 region:rollup2
C. SACK ONCE THE STATE TO POKE

00:54:07.111 --> 00:54:11.782 region:rollup2

00:54:09.113 --> 00:54:12.683 region:rollup2
OF WILDFIRE NOT ON HOW TO SHIFT

00:54:11.782 --> 00:54:14.451 region:rollup2
LIABILITY.

00:54:12.683 --> 00:54:15.552 region:rollup2
SO LET'S WORK TOGETHER FOR THAT

00:54:14.451 --> 00:54:18.322 region:rollup2
GOAL TO PROTECT ALL OF OUR

00:54:15.552 --> 00:54:18.622 region:rollup2

ASSOCIATION OF HOME AND AUTO

00:54:36.473 --> 00:54:38.175 region:rollup2
INSURERS OPERATING IN

TWENTY SEVENTEEN PROPERTY

00:54:45.482 --> 00:54:48.485 region:rollup2
INSURERS HAVE FOCUSED PRIMARILY

00:54:46.683 --> 00:54:49.820 region:rollup2
ON FIRE RESPONSE.

00:54:48.485 --> 00:54:50.921 region:rollup2
THOUSANDS OF CLAIMS PERSONNEL

00:54:49.820 --> 00:54:52.356 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN WORKING TO PROVIDE

00:54:50.921 --> 00:54:54.091 region:rollup2
EMERGENCY RELIEF SUCH AS

00:54:52.356 --> 00:54:55.692 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL LIVING EXPENSES.

00:54:54.091 --> 00:54:56.827 region:rollup2
AS WELL AS LONGER TERM BENEFITS

00:54:55.692 --> 00:54:58.662 region:rollup2

00:54:58.662 --> 00:55:01.298 region:rollup2
THERE HAVE BEEN OVER FORTY FIVE

00:55:00.364 --> 00:55:02.599 region:rollup2
THOUSAND INSURANCE CLAIMS FROM

00:55:01.298 --> 00:55:04.635 region:rollup2
LAST YEAR'S FIRES.

00:55:02.599 --> 00:55:06.570 region:rollup2
WITH INSURED LOSSES ESTIMATED TO

00:55:04.635 --> 00:55:08.038 region:rollup2
REACH TWELVE BILLION DOLLARS.

00:55:06.570 --> 00:55:09.640 region:rollup2
INSURERS HAVE HANDLED THESE

00:55:08.038 --> 00:55:10.807 region:rollup2
CLAIMS WHILE REMAINING SOLVENT.

00:55:09.640 --> 00:55:13.577 region:rollup2
AND WITHOUT ASKING THE

00:55:10.807 --> 00:55:15.012 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE FOR ANY RELIEF.

00:55:13.577 --> 00:55:16.647 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY THE WORK HAS NOT LET

00:55:15.012 --> 00:55:17.748 region:rollup2
UP IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN WITH THE

00:55:16.647 --> 00:55:19.016 region:rollup2
LATEST AND MOST DESTRUCTIVE

00:55:17.748 --> 00:55:20.751 region:rollup2
EVENT BEING THE CAR FIRE IN AND

00:55:19.016 --> 00:55:22.219 region:rollup2
AROUND READING.

00:55:20.751 --> 00:55:24.421 region:rollup2

00:55:22.219 --> 00:55:25.622 region:rollup2
REACH INSURED PROPERTY LOSSES OF

00:55:24.421 --> 00:55:26.823 region:rollup2
UP TO ONE POINT FIVE BILLION

00:55:25.622 --> 00:55:28.358 region:rollup2
DOLLARS.

00:55:26.823 --> 00:55:29.860 region:rollup2
INSURERS PRESENTLY HAVE HUNDREDS

00:55:28.358 --> 00:55:30.994 region:rollup2
OF CLAIMS PERSONNEL ON THE

00:55:29.860 --> 00:55:32.963 region:rollup2
GROUND RESPONDING TO FIRES

00:55:30.994 --> 00:55:34.264 region:rollup2
ACROSS THE STATE.

00:55:32.963 --> 00:55:36.033 region:rollup2
THE VAST MAJORITY OF FIRE

00:55:34.264 --> 00:55:36.633 region:rollup2
RELATED PROPERTY LOSS IS PAID

00:55:36.033 --> 00:55:38.669 region:rollup2
FOR BY GOVERNMENTS AND PRIVATE

00:55:36.633 --> 00:55:40.204 region:rollup2
INSURANCE WHICH REALLY MEANS

00:55:38.669 --> 00:55:41.738 region:rollup2
TAXPAYERS BUSINESSES HOMEOWNERS

00:55:40.204 --> 00:55:43.740 region:rollup2
AND RENTERS.

00:55:41.738 --> 00:55:45.442 region:rollup2
AND IN TOO MANY CASES THEY'RE

00:55:43.740 --> 00:55:47.244 region:rollup2
UNINSURED HOME LOSSES INCLUDING

00:55:45.442 --> 00:55:48.278 region:rollup2
OVER THREE HUNDRED SUCH CASES

00:55:47.244 --> 00:55:50.547 region:rollup2
RELATED TO THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN

00:55:48.278 --> 00:55:52.482 region:rollup2
NORTH BAY FIRES.

00:55:50.547 --> 00:55:52.950 region:rollup2
IT IS DIFFICULT OPERATE AN

00:55:52.482 --> 00:55:53.951 region:rollup2
INSURANCE BUSINESS IN

00:55:52.950 --> 00:55:55.552 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

00:55:53.951 --> 00:55:56.687 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA LAW PREVENTS INSURERS

00:55:55.552 --> 00:55:58.522 region:rollup2
FROM CHARGING ACTUAR REALLY

00:55:56.687 --> 00:55:58.956 region:rollup2
SOUND RATES IN MANY HIGH FIRE

00:55:58.522 --> 00:56:00.657 region:rollup2
AREAS.

00:55:58.956 --> 00:56:01.859 region:rollup2
IN FACT STATE REGULATIONS DO NOT

00:56:00.657 --> 00:56:03.493 region:rollup2
PERMIT THE USE OF FORWARD

00:56:01.859 --> 00:56:05.195 region:rollup2

ACTUAL COST OF REINSURANCE WHEN

00:56:05.195 --> 00:56:09.032 region:rollup2
DEVELOPING INSURANCE RATES.

00:56:07.130 --> 00:56:10.601 region:rollup2
THIS CAUSES INSURERS TO CONSIDER

00:56:09.032 --> 00:56:12.102 region:rollup2
A PARTIAL OR TOTAL WITHDRAWAL

00:56:10.601 --> 00:56:14.171 region:rollup2
FROM HIGH RISK COMMUNITIES.

00:56:12.102 --> 00:56:15.639 region:rollup2
WHICH UPSETS BOTH POLICY HOLDERS

00:56:14.171 --> 00:56:16.940 region:rollup2
AND POLICYMAKERS.

00:56:15.639 --> 00:56:18.742 region:rollup2
AND TRAPS INSURERS BETWEEN

00:56:16.940 --> 00:56:21.011 region:rollup2
EXPECTATIONS OF UNLIMITED

00:56:18.742 --> 00:56:21.445 region:rollup2
SERVICE TO ALL COMMUNITIES AND

00:56:21.011 --> 00:56:23.347 region:rollup2
RATE LEVELS THAT ARE

00:56:21.445 --> 00:56:25.148 region:rollup2
UNSUSTAINABLE.

00:56:23.347 --> 00:56:26.617 region:rollup2
IN MARCH WE WERE DISAPPOINTED

00:56:25.148 --> 00:56:27.918 region:rollup2
THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES

00:56:26.617 --> 00:56:29.519 region:rollup2
WERE BLAMING LONGSTANDING

00:56:27.918 --> 00:56:31.021 region:rollup2
LIABILITY RULES AND CLIMATE

00:56:29.519 --> 00:56:32.656 region:rollup2

00:56:31.021 --> 00:56:34.558 region:rollup2
SOLVENCY.

00:56:32.656 --> 00:56:36.560 region:rollup2
BUT LET'S BE CLEAR UTILITIES

00:56:34.558 --> 00:56:39.029 region:rollup2
HAVE DECADES OF HAD DECADES OF

00:56:36.560 --> 00:56:41.064 region:rollup2
WARNING ABOUT FOREST CONDITIONS.

00:56:39.029 --> 00:56:43.233 region:rollup2

CAMPBELL.

00:56:49.106 --> 00:56:52.776 region:rollup2
CLOSELY EXAMINED THESE ISSUES

00:56:50.774 --> 00:56:54.978 region:rollup2
AND THIS REPORT STATED. FOR MOST

00:56:52.776 --> 00:56:56.179 region:rollup2
FOREMOST AMONG THOSE LESSONS IS

00:56:54.978 --> 00:56:57.681 region:rollup2
A LACK OF POLITICAL WILL TO

00:56:56.179 --> 00:56:59.549 region:rollup2
PRIORITIZE COMPETING BUT

00:56:57.681 --> 00:57:00.684 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT POLICY GOALS PUBLIC

00:56:59.549 --> 00:57:02.386 region:rollup2
POLICY GOALS.

00:57:00.684 --> 00:57:04.221 region:rollup2

00:57:02.386 --> 00:57:05.222 region:rollup2
HABITAT PRESERVATION AND

00:57:04.221 --> 00:57:07.557 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION HAVE

00:57:05.222 --> 00:57:07.991 region:rollup2
OFTEN CONFLICTED WITH SOUND FIRE

00:57:07.557 --> 00:57:09.526 region:rollup2
SAFE PLANNING IN THE

00:57:10.861 --> 00:57:15.065 region:rollup2
UNLESS AND UNTIL PUBLIC POLICY

MAKERS OF GOVERNMENT.

00:57:15.065 --> 00:57:18.302 region:rollup2
MUSTER THE POLITICAL WILL TO PUT

00:57:16.934 --> 00:57:19.770 region:rollup2
THE PROTECTION OF OF LIFE AND

00:57:18.302 --> 00:57:21.104 region:rollup2
PROPERTY AHEAD OF COMPETING

00:57:19.770 --> 00:57:24.574 region:rollup2
POLITICAL AGENDAS THESE

00:57:21.104 --> 00:57:26.043 region:rollup2
TRAGEDIES ARE CERTAIN TO REPEAT.

00:57:24.574 --> 00:57:28.145 region:rollup2
LET'S NOT LET THE IOUS TAKE

00:57:26.043 --> 00:57:29.680 region:rollup2
DECADES OF WARNING AND SHIFT THE

SURROUNDING A NEW NORMAL.

00:57:31.915 --> 00:57:34.851 region:rollup2
IF INSURANCE THOUGHT THE CLIMATE

CHANGES MAKING CALIFORNIA

00:57:34.851 --> 00:57:38.455 region:rollup2
UNINSURABLE.

00:57:35.519 --> 00:57:39.690 region:rollup2
WE WOULD SAY SO.

01:03:24.501 --> 01:03:28.772 region:rollup2
EMINENT DOMAIN RIGHTS.

01:03:27.303 --> 01:03:30.974 region:rollup2
THE STANDARD ON INVERSE

01:03:28.772 --> 01:03:33.943 region:rollup2
CONDEMNATION IS.

01:03:30.974 --> 01:03:36.713 region:rollup2
WHETHER THE INJURY RESULTED FROM

01:03:33.943 --> 01:03:39.115 region:rollup2
THE INTENDED USE AND DESIGN OF

01:03:36.713 --> 01:03:41.251 region:rollup2
THE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM.

01:03:39.115 --> 01:03:44.487 region:rollup2
IF THE INJURY DID NOT RESULT

01:03:41.251 --> 01:03:46.156 region:rollup2
FROM THE INTENDED USE AND DESIGN

01:03:44.487 --> 01:03:47.190 region:rollup2
OF THE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM.

01:03:46.156 --> 01:03:50.794 region:rollup2
AN INVERSE CONDEMNATION DOES NOT

01:03:47.190 --> 01:03:52.929 region:rollup2
APPLY. FOR EXAMPLE.

01:03:50.794 --> 01:03:54.297 region:rollup2
IF A DRUNK DRIVER SWERVES A

01:03:52.929 --> 01:03:57.100 region:rollup2
HUNDRED YARDS OFF THE ROAD.

01:03:54.297 --> 01:03:58.802 region:rollup2
AND CRASHES INTO A UTILITY POLE.

01:03:57.100 --> 01:04:00.303 region:rollup2
THERE IS NO LIABILITY UNDER

01:03:58.802 --> 01:04:01.971 region:rollup2
UNDER INVERSE CONDEMNATION.

01:04:00.303 --> 01:04:04.140 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE INJURY DID NOT

01:04:01.971 --> 01:04:05.108 region:rollup2
RESULT FROM THE INTENDED USE AND

01:04:04.140 --> 01:04:07.544 region:rollup2
DESIGN.

01:04:05.108 --> 01:04:09.746 region:rollup2
OF THE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM.

01:04:07.544 --> 01:04:11.881 region:rollup2
WE HAVE HEARD A LOT ABOUT THE

01:04:09.746 --> 01:04:14.284 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT STEPS ES DE GENIE

01:04:11.881 --> 01:04:15.952 region:rollup2
HAS MADE IN THE LAST TEN YEARS.

01:04:14.284 --> 01:04:18.455 region:rollup2
INVESTING ONE BILLION DOLLARS

01:04:15.952 --> 01:04:20.690 region:rollup2
TOWARD PREVENTION.

01:04:18.455 --> 01:04:22.726 region:rollup2
IT IS UNDER THIS CURRENT

01:04:20.690 --> 01:04:25.528 region:rollup2
LIABILITY STRUCTURE THAT HAS

01:04:22.726 --> 01:04:28.164 region:rollup2
PRESSURED ES DE GENIE TO DO SO.

01:04:25.528 --> 01:04:30.133 region:rollup2
AND HAS PASSED THE VERY QUESTION

01:04:28.164 --> 01:04:32.635 region:rollup2
THAT INVERSE DEMANDS.

01:04:30.133 --> 01:04:35.138 region:rollup2
IS MY ELECTRICAL SYSTEM.

01:04:32.635 --> 01:04:38.274 region:rollup2
DESIGNED AND USED IN A WAY THAT

01:04:35.138 --> 01:04:40.977 region:rollup2
DOES NOT CAUSE WILD FIRES.

01:04:38.274 --> 01:04:44.881 region:rollup2
INVERSE CONDEMNATION EXISTS WHEN

01:04:40.977 --> 01:04:48.284 region:rollup2
P. GENIE CREATES THAT RISK.

01:04:44.881 --> 01:04:50.387 region:rollup2
IN IT'S INTENDED USE AND DESIGN.

01:04:48.284 --> 01:04:52.155 region:rollup2
SECONDLY INVERSE CONDEMNATION

01:04:50.387 --> 01:04:54.324 region:rollup2
REQUIRES A SHOWING THAT THE

01:04:52.155 --> 01:04:56.326 region:rollup2
INTENDED USE AND DESIGN WAS A

01:04:54.324 --> 01:04:57.894 region:rollup2
SUBSTANTIAL FACTOR IN CAUSING

01:04:56.326 --> 01:05:01.264 region:rollup2
THE INJURY.

01:04:57.894 --> 01:05:03.233 region:rollup2
IT IS SIMPLY NOT TRUE THAT IF P.

01:05:01.264 --> 01:05:04.701 region:rollup2
GENII IS 1% AT FAULT THEY ARE

01:05:03.233 --> 01:05:05.902 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBLE FOR A 100% OF THE

01:05:04.701 --> 01:05:07.237 region:rollup2
DAMAGES UNDER INVERSE

01:05:05.902 --> 01:05:09.305 region:rollup2
CONDEMNATION.

01:05:07.237 --> 01:05:11.174 region:rollup2
THAT EXAMPLE IS SIMPLY FALSE.

01:05:09.305 --> 01:05:14.344 region:rollup2
THAT CONCEPT OF APPORTIONMENT OF

01:05:11.174 --> 01:05:16.579 region:rollup2
FAULT APPLIES IN NEGLIGENCE.

01:05:14.344 --> 01:05:17.113 region:rollup2
INVERSE CONDEMNATION REQUIRES

01:05:16.579 --> 01:05:19.649 region:rollup2
THAT THE INTENDED USE AND

01:05:17.113 --> 01:05:21.651 region:rollup2
DESIGN.

01:05:19.649 --> 01:05:23.386 region:rollup2
WAS A SUBSTANTIAL FACTOR IN

01:05:21.651 --> 01:05:25.421 region:rollup2
CAUSING THE INJURY.

01:05:23.386 --> 01:05:28.258 region:rollup2
IT IS A NO FAULT SYSTEM OF

01:05:25.421 --> 01:05:30.160 region:rollup2
LIABILITY THAT ARISES WHEN I OWE

01:05:28.258 --> 01:05:31.961 region:rollup2
YOU EXERCISES ITS EMINENT DOMAIN

01:05:30.160 --> 01:05:32.862 region:rollup2

DIEGO FIRES.

01:05:56.586 --> 01:06:02.125 region:rollup2
THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IS FUN

01:05:59.322 --> 01:06:03.726 region:rollup2
CONSTITUTIONAL BECAUSE IT ROBS

01:06:02.125 --> 01:06:06.629 region:rollup2

01:06:10.333 --> 01:06:14.671 region:rollup2
THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL OFF IT

01:06:12.202 --> 01:06:16.806 region:rollup2
ALSO OPENS NEW PATHWAYS FOR

01:06:14.671 --> 01:06:19.042 region:rollup2
PROTRACTED LITIGATION AGAINST

01:06:16.806 --> 01:06:21.344 region:rollup2
LOCAL AND STATE AGENCIES.

01:06:19.042 --> 01:06:23.246 region:rollup2
AND UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE OF A

01:06:21.344 --> 01:06:24.848 region:rollup2
RUSHED PROPOSAL.

01:06:23.246 --> 01:06:27.217 region:rollup2
I UNDERSTAND A LEGISLATIVE

UNCONSTITUTIONALLY. TO BE CLEAR.

01:06:32.455 --> 01:06:36.726 region:rollup2
BUT GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL.

01:06:34.691 --> 01:06:38.595 region:rollup2

01:06:47.203 --> 01:06:49.272 region:rollup2
I CANNOT FIND THEM ON THE LAW

01:06:48.271 --> 01:06:50.540 region:rollup2
AND I'M CURIOUS TO KNOW WHERE

01:06:49.272 --> 01:06:53.142 region:rollup2
THEY CAME FROM.

01:06:50.540 --> 01:06:54.777 region:rollup2
THE LAUGHLIN FACTORS THE ACTUAL

01:06:58.848 --> 01:07:03.286 region:rollup2
WHERE THE INJURY?

01:07:00.617 --> 01:07:06.356 region:rollup2
IS THE EXACT FLOOD THAT THE

01:15:46.308 --> 01:15:49.512 region:rollup2
WHAT THE COURTS DID IN THOSE

01:15:47.710 --> 01:15:52.314 region:rollup2
CASES IS TAKE A LOOK AT A

01:15:49.512 --> 01:15:54.016 region:rollup2
SITUATION A GEOGRAPHICAL?

01:15:52.314 --> 01:15:57.720 region:rollup2
TOPOGRAPHICAL SITUATION WHERE

01:15:54.016 --> 01:16:00.156 region:rollup2
FLOODS ALREADY EXIST IT'S A RISK

01:15:57.720 --> 01:16:02.358 region:rollup2
THAT WAS ALREADY IN EXISTENCE

01:16:00.156 --> 01:16:03.426 region:rollup2
AND A GOVERNMENTAL ENTITY HAS

01:16:02.358 --> 01:16:06.529 region:rollup2
SAID WE'RE GOING TO GO NGUYEN

01:16:03.426 --> 01:16:08.631 region:rollup2
pRISK.

01:16:06.529 --> 01:16:10.733 region:rollup2
THE RISK IS ALREADY CREATED BY

01:16:08.631 --> 01:16:12.668 region:rollup2
NATURE AND A GOVERNMENTAL ENTITY

01:16:10.733 --> 01:16:14.937 region:rollup2
IS TAKING ON THE ROLE OF THE

01:16:12.668 --> 01:16:17.640 region:rollup2
RISK PREVENTER.

01:16:14.937 --> 01:16:20.209 region:rollup2
IN THAT SITUATION THE COURTS

01:16:17.640 --> 01:16:22.144 region:rollup2
WERE LOOKING AT A BALANCING OF

01:16:20.209 --> 01:16:24.313 region:rollup2
FACTORS WHEN THE GOVERNMENT IS

01:16:22.144 --> 01:16:27.283 region:rollup2
TAKING ON THE CONTROL OR THE

01:16:24.313 --> 01:16:30.486 region:rollup2
PREVENTION OF OF NATURE.

01:16:27.283 --> 01:16:32.922 region:rollup2
IT IS SUCH A NARROW EXCEPTION.

01:16:30.486 --> 01:16:34.690 region:rollup2
THAT BEAT FLOOD THAT IS THE

01:16:32.922 --> 01:16:36.258 region:rollup2
SUBJECT OF THE INJURY OF THE

01:16:34.690 --> 01:16:38.093 region:rollup2
LAWSUIT.

01:16:36.258 --> 01:16:40.029 region:rollup2
HAS TO BE THE VERY FLOOD THAT

01:16:38.093 --> 01:16:42.231 region:rollup2
WAS TRYING TO BE PREVENTED.

01:16:40.029 --> 01:16:44.133 region:rollup2
SO EVEN IN --

01:16:42.231 --> 01:16:44.867 region:rollup2
IN ANY OTHER TYPE OF SITUATION

01:16:44.133 --> 01:16:47.036 region:rollup2
AND IN FACTI'VE GIVEN YOU A

01:16:44.867 --> 01:16:47.937 region:rollup2
HAND OUT OF ABOUT SEVEN OR EIGHT

01:16:47.036 --> 01:16:50.139 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT CASES IN WHICH THE

01:16:47.937 --> 01:16:51.640 region:rollup2
LAUGHLIN FACTORS WERE REJECTED.

01:16:50.139 --> 01:16:54.610 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT IS SUCH A NARROW

01:16:51.640 --> 01:16:56.178 region:rollup2
EXCEPTION IT IS STILL INVERSE

01:16:54.610 --> 01:16:57.346 region:rollup2
CONDEMNATION BUT IT ONLY APPLIES

01:16:56.178 --> 01:16:59.048 region:rollup2
WHEN THE GOVERNMENT HAS PUT ON

01:16:57.346 --> 01:16:59.915 region:rollup2
THIS HALF OF SAID HEY WE'RE

01:16:59.048 --> 01:17:02.451 region:rollup2
GOING TO GO AND TRY TO PREVENT A

01:16:59.915 --> 01:17:04.653 region:rollup2
RISK THAT ALREADY EXISTS.

01:17:02.451 --> 01:17:06.856 region:rollup2
P. GENIE IS NOT A FIRE

01:17:04.653 --> 01:17:10.025 region:rollup2
PREVENTION DISTRICT.

01:17:06.856 --> 01:17:13.195 region:rollup2
THEY ARE CREATING A RISK WHEN

01:17:10.025 --> 01:17:15.831 region:rollup2
THEY DESIGN AND USE THEIR SYSTEM

01:17:13.195 --> 01:17:18.200 region:rollup2
AS INTENDED.

01:17:15.831 --> 01:17:20.736 region:rollup2
THAT IS JUST LIKE EVERY OTHER

01:17:18.200 --> 01:17:22.838 region:rollup2
ALL 99% OF OTHER INVERSE

01:17:20.736 --> 01:17:25.074 region:rollup2
CONDEMNATION CASES IS BECAUSE

01:17:22.838 --> 01:17:26.208 region:rollup2
THE GOVERNMENT IS CREATING A

01:17:25.074 --> 01:17:29.712 region:rollup2
RISK OR HEAR THE GOVERNMENT HAS

01:17:26.208 --> 01:17:31.380 region:rollup2
GRANTED POWERS. TO BE I OWE YOU

01:17:29.712 --> 01:17:34.350 region:rollup2
WHICH NOW HAS BROAD EMINENT

01:17:31.380 --> 01:17:36.552 region:rollup2
DOMAIN POWERS. TO PUT POLLS AND

01:17:34.350 --> 01:17:38.587 region:rollup2
LINES AND DESIGN THEIR SYSTEM

01:17:36.552 --> 01:17:39.855 region:rollup2
QUITE FRANKLY IN.

01:17:38.587 --> 01:17:41.390 region:rollup2
AND AWAY THAT GIVES THEM AN

01:17:39.855 --> 01:17:43.359 region:rollup2
ENORMOUS POWER TO DO SO.

01:17:41.390 --> 01:17:45.060 region:rollup2
THEY'VE CREATED THAT RISK AND

01:17:43.359 --> 01:17:47.296 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHY DID TRADITIONAL

01:17:45.060 --> 01:17:48.831 region:rollup2
STANDARD WHICH IS INTENDED USE

01:17:47.296 --> 01:17:51.667 region:rollup2
AND DESIGN APPLIES TO ELECTRICAL

01:17:48.831 --> 01:17:54.103 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS.

01:17:51.667 --> 01:17:57.273 region:rollup2
IF I IF I MAY FAT IN THE IN THE

01:17:54.103 --> 01:17:58.707 region:rollup2
pSENATOR JACKSON'S ASKING ABOUT

01:17:57.273 --> 01:18:00.643 region:rollup2
THEY SPEND EIGHT PARAGRAPHS

01:17:58.707 --> 01:18:02.144 region:rollup2
ANALYZING JUST THIS ISSUE.

01:18:00.643 --> 01:18:05.447 region:rollup2
IT WAS THE EXPLICIT ARGUMENT BY

01:18:02.144 --> 01:18:07.116 region:rollup2
EDISON IN THAT CASE. TO HAVE THE

01:18:05.447 --> 01:18:08.517 region:rollup2
LACHLAN FACTORS APPLY TO THEM.

01:18:07.116 --> 01:18:11.186 region:rollup2
THE COURT TOOK EIGHT PARAGRAPHS

01:18:08.517 --> 01:18:12.621 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT WHY THERE IS NO

01:18:11.186 --> 01:18:13.522 region:rollup2
COMPARISON AT ALL.

01:18:12.621 --> 01:18:16.425 region:rollup2
AND IN FACT.

01:18:13.522 --> 01:18:17.026 region:rollup2
IF IF IN THAT CASE EDISON GOT

01:18:16.425 --> 01:18:18.460 region:rollup2
WHAT IT WANTED WHERE DOES THAT

01:18:17.026 --> 01:18:20.262 region:rollup2
END.

01:18:18.460 --> 01:18:22.131 region:rollup2
HOW MANY OTHER WAYS WOULD BE

01:18:20.262 --> 01:18:23.933 region:rollup2
PEOPLE OR GOVERNMENTS BE SIR

01:18:22.131 --> 01:18:25.568 region:rollup2
SEEKING TO ESCAPE LIABILITY?

01:18:23.933 --> 01:18:28.103 region:rollup2
AND FOR THAT REASON THE COURT

01:18:25.568 --> 01:18:29.738 region:rollup2
ROUND THE OBJECT A REJECTED THE

01:18:28.103 --> 01:18:32.441 region:rollup2
USE OF LACHLAN FACTORS IN THESE

01:18:29.738 --> 01:18:33.409 region:rollup2
UTILITY CASES.

01:18:32.441 --> 01:18:34.043 region:rollup2
AND IF I COULD AND THEN I'LL

01:18:33.409 --> 01:18:35.444 region:rollup2
JUST I'LL TURN TO SENATOR HUESO

01:18:34.043 --> 01:18:37.246 region:rollup2
--

01:18:35.444 --> 01:18:38.981 region:rollup2
BUT I GUESS I'M I'M.

01:18:37.246 --> 01:18:40.783 region:rollup2
JUST WANNA MAKE SURE I'M CLEAR

01:18:38.981 --> 01:18:42.885 region:rollup2
ABOUT HOW YOU DESCRIBED.

01:18:40.783 --> 01:18:45.120 region:rollup2
OF THIS POTENTIAL RISK THAT

01:18:42.885 --> 01:18:46.989 region:rollup2
UTILITIES CREATED THE RISK I

01:18:45.120 --> 01:18:47.623 region:rollup2
THINK IS WHAT YOU DESCRIBE BY

01:18:46.989 --> 01:18:49.291 region:rollup2
VIRTUE OF THE FACT THAT THEY'RE

01:18:47.623 --> 01:18:50.726 region:rollup2
PUTTING.

01:18:49.291 --> 01:18:51.860 region:rollup2
BUILDING POLLS AND LONGTIME GOOD

01:18:50.726 --> 01:18:55.497 region:rollup2
RUNNING.

01:18:51.860 --> 01:18:57.032 region:rollup2
THROUGH WOODED AREAS RIGHT --

01:18:55.497 --> 01:18:58.400 region:rollup2
HOW DO YOU?

01:18:57.032 --> 01:19:00.235 region:rollup2
AT THE END OF THE DAY HOW DO YOU

01:18:58.400 --> 01:19:01.470 region:rollup2
BALANCE THAT WITH THE FACT THAT

01:19:00.235 --> 01:19:03.505 region:rollup2
WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH

01:19:01.470 --> 01:19:04.139 region:rollup2
TO HIS PROVIDE UTILITY POWER.

01:19:03.505 --> 01:19:06.842 region:rollup2
THROUGHOUT.THE SPADE AND IT HAS

01:19:04.139 --> 01:19:08.978 region:rollup2
TO RUN

01:19:06.842 --> 01:19:11.180 region:rollup2
THROUGH AREAS.

01:19:08.978 --> 01:19:13.949 region:rollup2
THAT ARE IN THIS CASE WOODED AND

01:19:11.180 --> 01:19:16.085 region:rollup2
NOT ALL BUT AND THEN KAMOSE

01:19:13.949 --> 01:19:17.486 region:rollup2
WHERE THEY HAVE TO RUN THROUGH

01:19:16.085 --> 01:19:18.621 region:rollup2
AREAS WHERE THERE COULD BE

01:19:17.486 --> 01:19:19.121 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL.

01:19:18.621 --> 01:19:21.991 region:rollup2
FIRE RISK BUT IT FOR THE

01:19:19.121 --> 01:19:23.959 region:rollup2
BENEFIT.

01:19:21.991 --> 01:19:25.628 region:rollup2
OF EVERYBODY IN THIS ROOM AND

01:19:23.959 --> 01:19:26.929 region:rollup2
EVERYONE OUTSIDE OF THIS ROOM.

01:19:25.628 --> 01:19:28.731 region:rollup2
SO THAT WHEN THEY HIT THE SWITCH

01:19:26.929 --> 01:19:31.700 region:rollup2
THE LIGHTS COME ON SO I I'M

01:19:28.731 --> 01:19:33.335 region:rollup2
TRYING TO RECONCILE THESE.

01:19:31.700 --> 01:19:35.271 region:rollup2
GREAT QUESTION IF IT BRING OUR

01:19:33.335 --> 01:19:37.273 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE A WONDERFUL EXAMPLE.

01:19:35.271 --> 01:19:40.009 region:rollup2
AFTER A REAL WORLD EXAMPLE AFTER

01:19:37.273 --> 01:19:42.244 region:rollup2
THE TWO THOUSAND SEVEN FIRES --

01:19:40.009 --> 01:19:44.013 region:rollup2
INVERSE CONDEMNATION WAS APPLIED

01:19:42.244 --> 01:19:46.448 region:rollup2
AGAINST SD JEANNIE.

01:19:44.013 --> 01:19:48.651 region:rollup2
IT REQUIRED SDG NEED TO ASK THE

01:19:46.448 --> 01:19:50.919 region:rollup2
QUESTION ON INFERS.

01:19:48.651 --> 01:19:53.756 region:rollup2
DOES OUR SYSTEM IS OUR SYSTEM

01:19:50.919 --> 01:19:56.058 region:rollup2
INTENDED AND DESIGNED AND USED

01:19:53.756 --> 01:19:58.460 region:rollup2
IN A WAY THAT REDUCES OR

01:19:56.058 --> 01:19:59.962 region:rollup2
ELIMINATES THAT RISK.

01:19:58.460 --> 01:20:01.764 region:rollup2
AS THE GENIE SAID TO THEMSELVES

01:19:59.962 --> 01:20:03.632 region:rollup2
WE DO NOT WANT HAVE TO PAY

01:20:01.764 --> 01:20:05.467 region:rollup2
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND BURN

01:20:03.632 --> 01:20:06.835 region:rollup2
DOWN HOMES EVER AGAIN.

01:20:05.467 --> 01:20:08.170 region:rollup2
THEY ASK THEMSELVES THAT

01:20:06.835 --> 01:20:10.005 region:rollup2
QUESTION THAT'S WHY INVERSE

01:20:08.170 --> 01:20:11.907 region:rollup2
CONDEMNATION IS SO IMPORTANT IT

01:20:10.005 --> 01:20:13.876 region:rollup2
REQUIRES THE UTILITIES TO ASK

01:20:11.907 --> 01:20:15.844 region:rollup2
THEMSELVES THAT QUESTION. TO

01:20:13.876 --> 01:20:17.713 region:rollup2
REDUCE AND ELIMINATE.

01:20:15.844 --> 01:20:20.449 region:rollup2
THE RISK THEY SPEND ONE BILLION

01:20:17.713 --> 01:20:22.651 region:rollup2
DOLLARS OVER THE PAST TEN YEARS.

01:20:20.449 --> 01:20:25.120 region:rollup2
AND JUST RECENTLY IN THE LILACS

01:20:22.651 --> 01:20:26.288 region:rollup2
FIRE IS ABOUT FIVE MILES FROM MY

01:20:25.120 --> 01:20:27.356 region:rollup2
HOUSE I WAS WAITING FOR US TO DO

01:20:26.288 --> 01:20:28.991 region:rollup2
YOU NEED TO MAKE AN ANNOUNCEMENT

01:20:27.356 --> 01:20:32.127 region:rollup2
THAT THEY'RE TURNING OFF POWER.

01:20:28.991 --> 01:20:32.695 region:rollup2
THEY TURNED OFF POWER. FOR

01:20:32.127 --> 01:20:33.762 region:rollup2
EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY THOUSAND

01:20:32.695 --> 01:20:34.530 region:rollup2
CUSTOMERS FOR ABOUT EIGHT TO

01:20:33.762 --> 01:20:36.432 region:rollup2
TWELVE HOURS.

01:20:34.530 --> 01:20:37.633 region:rollup2
AND I WAS VERY IMPRESSED AT THE

01:20:36.432 --> 01:20:39.868 region:rollup2
THEIR ABILITY TO MAKE THOSE

01:20:37.633 --> 01:20:43.205 region:rollup2
DECISIONS TO POWER DOWN AND HIGH

01:20:39.868 --> 01:20:45.808 region:rollup2
WHEN POLICIES SO THE LAW ASKS P.

01:20:43.205 --> 01:20:48.644 region:rollup2
GENIE. TO LOOK AT THE WAY THEY

01:20:45.808 --> 01:20:50.079 region:rollup2
DESIGN THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE WHAT

01:20:48.644 --> 01:20:51.613 region:rollup2
KIND OF POLLS ARE USING WHAT

01:20:50.079 --> 01:20:53.615 region:rollup2
KIND OF VEGETATION MANAGEMENT

01:20:51.613 --> 01:20:55.751 region:rollup2
POLICIES DO WE HAVE WHAT KIND OF

01:20:53.615 --> 01:20:57.820 region:rollup2
RE CLOSER POLICIES DO WE HAVE

01:20:55.751 --> 01:20:59.388 region:rollup2
WHAT KIND OF A POWER DOWN IN

01:20:57.820 --> 01:21:01.323 region:rollup2
HIGH WIND SITUATIONS DO WE HAVE.

01:20:59.388 --> 01:21:02.524 region:rollup2
WHEN WE'RE INTENDING AND USING

01:21:01.323 --> 01:21:04.259 region:rollup2
OUR SYSTEM IN A WAY THAT

01:21:02.524 --> 01:21:06.662 region:rollup2
ELIMINATES RISK THAT'S HOW WE

01:21:04.259 --> 01:21:07.796 region:rollup2
RECONCILE DELIVERING POWER TO

01:21:06.662 --> 01:21:11.166 region:rollup2
FIFTEEN MILLION PEOPLE?

01:21:07.796 --> 01:21:13.669 region:rollup2
AND STILL ARE REDUCING THE RISK.

01:21:11.166 --> 01:21:15.404 region:rollup2
SO YOU IMPLEMENT A PGA ANY

01:21:13.669 --> 01:21:17.172 region:rollup2
STRATEGY THAT DEFINES IN YOUR

01:21:15.404 --> 01:21:18.640 region:rollup2
MIND A PRUDENT MANAGER.

01:21:17.172 --> 01:21:20.976 region:rollup2
I'M SORRY CAN YOU REPEAT THAT

01:21:18.640 --> 01:21:23.212 region:rollup2
THE STANDARDS THAT P. JEANNIE.

01:21:20.976 --> 01:21:24.246 region:rollup2
HAVE IMPLEMENTED DOES THAT.

01:21:23.212 --> 01:21:27.783 region:rollup2
ESTABLISHING YOUR MIND APPROVING

01:21:24.246 --> 01:21:29.284 region:rollup2
MANAGER THAT P. SORRY I'M SAFE

01:21:27.783 --> 01:21:31.320 region:rollup2
EUGENIE ES DE JEANNIE THE

01:21:29.284 --> 01:21:32.755 region:rollup2
ACRONYMS ARE KILLING ME FOR SDG

01:21:31.320 --> 01:21:33.889 region:rollup2
ANY -- I

01:21:32.755 --> 01:21:35.724 region:rollup2
WOULD HAVE TO LOOK AT ALL OF THE

01:21:33.889 --> 01:21:37.926 region:rollup2
POLICIES AND THIS IS ACTUALLY

01:21:35.724 --> 01:21:39.128 region:rollup2
PART OF A DISCOVERY PROCESS IN

01:21:37.926 --> 01:21:41.597 region:rollup2
LITIGATION ROUND THE CONGRESS'S

01:21:39.128 --> 01:21:43.832 region:rollup2
RIGHT BUT I DO BELIEVE THE SD

01:21:41.597 --> 01:21:45.934 region:rollup2
GENIE HAS SET A STANDARD THAT IS

01:21:43.832 --> 01:21:46.935 region:rollup2
SO FAR AND ABOVE WHAT P. GENIE

01:21:45.934 --> 01:21:48.604 region:rollup2
HAS DONE.

01:21:46.935 --> 01:21:51.039 region:rollup2
THAT P. GINNY REGARDLESS OF WHAT

01:21:48.604 --> 01:21:53.041 region:rollup2
AS TO JEANNIE HAS DONE NEEDS TO

01:21:51.039 --> 01:21:55.043 region:rollup2
CATCH UP OKAY --

01:21:53.041 --> 01:21:57.279 region:rollup2
I THINK SOONER HUESO --

01:21:55.043 --> 01:21:58.046 region:rollup2
AND THE SOONER CHAD MAYES NOT I

01:21:57.279 --> 01:22:01.650 region:rollup2
JUST WANT TO GET TO THE

01:21:58.046 --> 01:22:03.085 region:rollup2
DISTINCTIONS AS TO WHY --

01:22:01.650 --> 01:22:05.254 region:rollup2
FLOOD CONTROL DISTRICTS WERE

01:22:03.085 --> 01:22:07.623 region:rollup2
STYLISH TO BEGIN.

01:22:05.254 --> 01:22:09.191 region:rollup2
SO WHY DID WE EVEN NEED A FOUGHT

01:22:07.623 --> 01:22:10.826 region:rollup2
FOR FLOOD CONTROL CRUISE CONTROL

01:22:09.191 --> 01:22:13.695 region:rollup2
DISTRICT WITH A SPECIFIC WHICH

01:22:10.826 --> 01:22:16.265 region:rollup2
YOU MENTIONED A BALANCING FACTOR

01:22:13.695 --> 01:22:17.699 region:rollup2
[inaudible] TO ESTABLISH.

01:22:16.265 --> 01:22:21.203 region:rollup2
LIABILITY IN THE CASES OF

01:22:17.699 --> 01:22:22.838 region:rollup2
PROPERTY OWNERS AND FLOODING.

01:22:21.203 --> 01:22:24.740 region:rollup2
WELL ORIGINALLY FLOOD CONTROL

01:22:22.838 --> 01:22:26.308 region:rollup2
DISTRICT'S CAME BEFORE --

01:22:24.740 --> 01:22:27.843 region:rollup2
THE BALANCING LAWS IN THE OLD

01:22:26.308 --> 01:22:30.445 region:rollup2
WESTERN DAYS PEOPLE WERE WALKING

01:22:27.843 --> 01:22:31.814 region:rollup2
AROUND IN MUDDY DIRTY WATER AND

01:22:30.445 --> 01:22:32.347 region:rollup2
WE REALIZED IN ORDER TO BUILD

01:22:31.814 --> 01:22:33.549 region:rollup2
GOOD SOCIETIES IN ORDER TO

01:22:32.347 --> 01:22:36.151 region:rollup2
ALLOW.

01:22:33.549 --> 01:22:37.352 region:rollup2
OUT ROADS TO BE USED IN ORDER

01:22:36.151 --> 01:22:38.821 region:rollup2
FOR OUR HOMES TO BE BUILDING

01:22:37.352 --> 01:22:40.989 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES TO BE BUILT WE

01:22:38.821 --> 01:22:42.958 region:rollup2
NEEDED TO WORK AGAINST NATURE.

01:22:40.989 --> 01:22:45.594 region:rollup2
AND SO WE'RE TRYING TO MITIGATE

01:22:42.958 --> 01:22:48.330 region:rollup2
THAT RISK IN THE MITIGATION OF

01:22:45.594 --> 01:22:51.733 region:rollup2
THAT RISK THE LAW RECOGNIZES

01:22:48.330 --> 01:22:53.769 region:rollup2
THAT THE RISK ALREADY EXISTS AS

01:22:51.733 --> 01:22:55.737 region:rollup2
A FUNCTION OF NATURE GEOGRAPHY

01:22:53.769 --> 01:22:57.472 region:rollup2
TOPOGRAPHY AND AND SO THE SHORT

01:22:55.737 --> 01:22:58.607 region:rollup2
ANSWER IS IN ORDER TO DEVELOP

01:22:57.472 --> 01:23:00.909 region:rollup2
LAND YOU NEEDED TO CREATE A

01:22:58.607 --> 01:23:02.678 region:rollup2
FLOOD CONTROL DISTRICT. TO AT

01:23:00.909 --> 01:23:04.112 region:rollup2
LEAST ALLOW THOSE INVESTMENTS TO

01:23:02.678 --> 01:23:05.314 region:rollup2
BE MADE.

01:23:04.112 --> 01:23:07.583 region:rollup2
SO IT IT IT TRIGGERED THE

01:23:05.314 --> 01:23:09.117 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT OF LAND --

01:23:07.583 --> 01:23:10.285 region:rollup2
NO I THINK IT'S THE OTHER WAY

01:23:09.117 --> 01:23:11.753 region:rollup2
AROUND I THINK FLOOD CONTROL

01:23:10.285 --> 01:23:13.355 region:rollup2
DISTRICTS WERE DOING THE JOB

01:23:11.753 --> 01:23:16.458 region:rollup2
THAT THEY NEEDED TO DO.

01:23:13.355 --> 01:23:17.826 region:rollup2
IN MITIGATING A RISK.

01:23:16.458 --> 01:23:19.528 region:rollup2
THEY DIDN'T DOES SIGN FOR

01:23:17.826 --> 01:23:21.363 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE THE FLOOD.

01:23:19.528 --> 01:23:23.031 region:rollup2
THEY DIDN'T DESIGN THE WAY THAT

01:23:21.363 --> 01:23:25.534 region:rollup2
THE MOUNTAINS AND THE RAIN WATER

01:23:23.031 --> 01:23:28.036 region:rollup2
FLOODS INTO A CERTAIN BASIN.

01:23:25.534 --> 01:23:29.037 region:rollup2
HERE ESTEEM GENIE P. GENIE

01:23:28.036 --> 01:23:31.039 region:rollup2
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON ARE

01:23:29.037 --> 01:23:32.474 region:rollup2
STARTING FROM SCRATCH.

01:23:31.039 --> 01:23:34.710 region:rollup2
THEY'RE PUTTING IN THE POLL

01:23:32.474 --> 01:23:36.979 region:rollup2
THEY'RE PUTTING IN THE RISK WITH

01:23:34.710 --> 01:23:38.313 region:rollup2
FLOOD CONTROL DISTRICT THE RISK

01:23:36.979 --> 01:23:39.214 region:rollup2
IS CREATED BUT NO NO I'M I'M

01:23:38.313 --> 01:23:40.616 region:rollup2
UPON WHICH I ONLY HAVE LIMITED

01:23:39.214 --> 01:23:41.950 region:rollup2
TIME.

01:23:40.616 --> 01:23:44.253 region:rollup2
GET TO MY POINT.

01:23:41.950 --> 01:23:45.921 region:rollup2
AND I JUST WANNA I JUST WANT

01:23:44.253 --> 01:23:48.056 region:rollup2
ESTABLISH WHAT THAT.

01:23:45.921 --> 01:23:50.325 region:rollup2
THAT FULCRUM IS A DECIDES WHERE

01:23:48.056 --> 01:23:54.162 region:rollup2
WHERE THE LAWS APPLIED SO.

01:23:50.325 --> 01:23:55.497 region:rollup2
IN THE CASE OF OF OF FLOOD

01:23:54.162 --> 01:23:57.065 region:rollup2
CONTROL DISTRICT IT WAS THE

01:23:55.497 --> 01:23:57.966 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT OF THE ULTIMATELY

01:23:57.065 --> 01:23:59.134 region:rollup2
IT'S THE DEVELOPMENT OF LAND

01:23:57.966 --> 01:24:00.035 region:rollup2
WITHOUT A FULL PHILIP CONTROL

01:23:59.134 --> 01:24:01.904 region:rollup2
DISTRICT.

01:24:00.035 --> 01:24:02.471 region:rollup2
HE CAN'T THE FLOODS COME AND WE

01:24:01.904 --> 01:24:03.605 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND YOU'RE NOT GONNA

01:24:02.471 --> 01:24:05.140 region:rollup2
CONTROL NATURE.

01:24:03.605 --> 01:24:07.276 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW SO THAT YOU CAN YOU CAN

01:24:05.140 --> 01:24:08.377 region:rollup2
MITIGATE IMPACTS OF A NO SIR

01:24:07.276 --> 01:24:09.912 region:rollup2
THAT'S NOT THE POLICY REASONING

01:24:08.377 --> 01:24:11.179 region:rollup2
BEHIND THE FLOOD CONTROL CASES

01:24:09.912 --> 01:24:12.614 region:rollup2
THE POLICY REASON BEHIND THE

01:24:11.179 --> 01:24:14.116 region:rollup2
FLOOD CONTROL CASES IS THAT

01:24:12.614 --> 01:24:16.151 region:rollup2
NATURE HAS CREATED THE RISK.

01:24:14.116 --> 01:24:17.252 region:rollup2
AND HERE I OKAY EN IS CREATING

01:24:16.151 --> 01:24:19.354 region:rollup2
THE RISK WITH INFRASTRUCTURE

01:24:17.252 --> 01:24:20.923 region:rollup2
THAT'S A FULCRUM WELL.

01:24:19.354 --> 01:24:22.357 region:rollup2
IT AND THAT MAY BE SO.

01:24:20.923 --> 01:24:24.660 region:rollup2
THE QUESTION IS [inaudible]

01:24:22.357 --> 01:24:26.528 region:rollup2
TODAY.

01:24:24.660 --> 01:24:29.665 region:rollup2
IS A AND YOU'RE ARGUING THAT

01:24:26.528 --> 01:24:30.699 region:rollup2
MAYBE IT'S NOT --

01:24:29.665 --> 01:24:32.100 region:rollup2
CLIMATE CHANGE THIS BECAUSE IN

01:24:30.699 --> 01:24:34.770 region:rollup2
THE RISK.

01:24:32.100 --> 01:24:36.605 region:rollup2
NO EIGHT WHAT'S CAUSING THE RISK

01:24:34.770 --> 01:24:37.806 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IN ORIGIN.

01:24:36.605 --> 01:24:39.608 region:rollup2
AND THERE ARE AND THERE ARE

01:24:37.806 --> 01:24:41.076 region:rollup2
ENORMOUS TEAMS OF LAWYERS ON

01:24:39.608 --> 01:24:42.477 region:rollup2
BOTH SIDES OF AYE USING

01:24:41.076 --> 01:24:44.146 region:rollup2
PLAINTIFFS.

01:24:42.477 --> 01:24:45.547 region:rollup2
THAT HAVE VERY EXPERIENCED FIRE

01:24:44.146 --> 01:24:47.716 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATORS.

01:24:45.547 --> 01:24:49.718 region:rollup2
CAL FIRE DETERMINES THE ACTUAL

01:24:47.716 --> 01:24:51.453 region:rollup2
CAUSE AND ORIGIN OF THE FIRE THE

01:24:49.718 --> 01:24:52.921 region:rollup2
SPARK STARTS SOMEWHERE.

01:24:51.453 --> 01:24:54.356 region:rollup2
AND THAT SOMEWHERE COMES FROM

01:24:52.921 --> 01:24:56.091 region:rollup2
THE INTENDED USE AND DESIGN THE

01:24:54.356 --> 01:24:58.827 region:rollup2
WEEPY GENIE HAS DESIGNED ITS

01:24:56.091 --> 01:25:01.163 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE CAUSES THE SPARK.

01:24:58.827 --> 01:25:02.965 region:rollup2
CLIMATE CHANGE MAY EXACERBATE

01:25:01.163 --> 01:25:04.866 region:rollup2
THE SITUATION WHICH IS ALL THE

01:25:02.965 --> 01:25:07.502 region:rollup2
MORE REASON WHY WE NEED INVERSE

01:25:04.866 --> 01:25:09.738 region:rollup2
CONDEMNATION TO REDUCE THAT RISK

01:25:07.502 --> 01:25:11.440 region:rollup2
SNIPPY JEANNIE ASKS ITSELF.

01:25:09.738 --> 01:25:13.075 region:rollup2
DOES OUR SYSTEM IS OUR SYSTEM

01:25:11.440 --> 01:25:14.977 region:rollup2
DESIGNED IN USED IN A WAY THAT

01:25:13.075 --> 01:25:16.578 region:rollup2
REDUCES THAT RISK IN LIGHT OF

01:25:14.977 --> 01:25:17.713 region:rollup2
CLIMATE CHANGE ARE BUT DON'T YOU

01:25:16.578 --> 01:25:19.748 region:rollup2
THINK WE'RE HERE BECAUSE OF

01:25:17.713 --> 01:25:21.516 region:rollup2
CLIMATE CHANGE DON'T YOU THINK

01:25:19.748 --> 01:25:24.453 region:rollup2
CLIMATE CHANGE HAS TRIGGERED --

01:25:21.516 --> 01:25:26.755 region:rollup2
ENORMOUS MODIFIERS AND A DROUGHT

01:25:24.453 --> 01:25:27.756 region:rollup2
THAT HAS DECIMATED A HUNDRED

01:25:26.755 --> 01:25:30.258 region:rollup2
TWENTY MILLION TREES THAT HAS

01:25:27.756 --> 01:25:32.494 region:rollup2
CREATED MORE FUEL THAN THE STATE

01:25:30.258 --> 01:25:33.895 region:rollup2
OR ANYONE INCLUDING UTILITY OR

01:25:32.494 --> 01:25:34.997 region:rollup2
PROPERTY OWNER CAN MANAGE I

01:25:33.895 --> 01:25:36.531 region:rollup2
THINK WE'RE HERE TODAY AT THIS

01:25:34.997 --> 01:25:37.099 region:rollup2
HEARING BECAUSE THE P. GENIUS

01:25:36.531 --> 01:25:38.100 region:rollup2
ASKING FOR SOME SORT OF BAIL

01:25:37.099 --> 01:25:39.067 region:rollup2
OUT.

01:25:38.100 --> 01:25:40.736 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE'RE HERE

01:25:39.067 --> 01:25:42.070 region:rollup2
TODAY FOR THIS HEARING I DON'T

01:25:40.736 --> 01:25:43.472 region:rollup2
THINK WE'RE HERE TODAY BECAUSE

01:25:42.070 --> 01:25:45.140 region:rollup2
OF OVERALL CLIMATE CHANGE I

01:25:43.472 --> 01:25:46.708 region:rollup2
THINK THERE ARE OTHER HEARINGS

01:25:45.140 --> 01:25:48.010 region:rollup2
THAT MAY ADDRESS THAT.

01:25:46.708 --> 01:25:49.978 region:rollup2
ONLY ONE BUT THE WELL THAT'S

01:25:48.010 --> 01:25:51.179 region:rollup2
WHAT YOU'RE DEVIATE IN OTHER

01:25:49.978 --> 01:25:53.448 region:rollup2
WORDS I ASKED A QUESTION.

01:25:51.179 --> 01:25:55.217 region:rollup2
THE QUESTION WAS IS CLIMATE

01:25:53.448 --> 01:25:57.252 region:rollup2
CHANGE BECAUSE INNOCENT CAN WE

01:25:55.217 --> 01:25:58.387 region:rollup2
KNOW CERCAN CONT CLIMATE CHANGE

01:25:57.252 --> 01:26:00.322 region:rollup2
DOES NOTCAUSE AND START

01:25:58.387 --> 01:26:01.256 region:rollup2
WILDFIRES.

01:26:00.322 --> 01:26:03.191 region:rollup2
DOES DOES THAT DOES DOES A

01:26:01.256 --> 01:26:05.427 region:rollup2
CONSTRUCT DROUGHT THAT CAUSES

01:26:03.191 --> 01:26:06.828 region:rollup2
PLAGUE THAT CAUSES THE DEATH OF

01:26:05.427 --> 01:26:08.463 region:rollup2
A HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION TREES

01:26:06.828 --> 01:26:09.965 region:rollup2
CERTAIN KNOW WHAT CAUSES

01:26:08.463 --> 01:26:10.465 region:rollup2
WILDFIRES IN YOU CAN ASK CAL

01:26:09.965 --> 01:26:12.934 region:rollup2
FIRE.

01:26:10.465 --> 01:26:14.970 region:rollup2
IN SIXTEEN OF CASES THEY FOUND

01:26:12.934 --> 01:26:17.672 region:rollup2
THAT P. GINNY BECAUSE SIXTEEN OF

01:26:14.970 --> 01:26:19.441 region:rollup2
THOSE FIRES IN ELEVEN OF THOSE

01:26:17.672 --> 01:26:20.909 region:rollup2
SIXTEEN PGD FAILED TO FOLLOW

01:26:19.441 --> 01:26:22.144 region:rollup2
CURRENT STATE STANDARDS.

01:26:20.909 --> 01:26:25.614 region:rollup2
P. JEANNIE AND ITS EQUIPMENT HAS

01:26:22.144 --> 01:26:26.948 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I AGREE THAT CLIMATE

01:26:25.614 --> 01:26:28.450 region:rollup2
CHANGE IS HERE.

01:26:26.948 --> 01:26:30.652 region:rollup2
I AGREE THAT CLIMATE CHANGE MAY

01:26:28.450 --> 01:26:32.287 region:rollup2
EXACERBATE THE SITUATION IT'S

01:26:30.652 --> 01:26:33.722 region:rollup2
ALL THE MORE REASON WHY WE NEED

01:26:32.287 --> 01:26:35.757 region:rollup2
TO BE PROTECTIVE OF HOMEOWNERS

01:26:33.722 --> 01:26:36.792 region:rollup2
AND ASK THESE COMPANIES TO ASK

01:26:35.757 --> 01:26:39.861 region:rollup2
THEMSELVES.

01:26:36.792 --> 01:26:41.930 region:rollup2
IS OUR SYSTEM DESIGNED AND USED

01:26:39.861 --> 01:26:43.665 region:rollup2
IN A WAY THAT REDUCES THAT RISK.

01:26:41.930 --> 01:26:45.300 region:rollup2
AND I I JUST WANTED TO ESTABLISH

01:26:43.665 --> 01:26:47.402 region:rollup2
THE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE FLOOD

01:26:45.300 --> 01:26:50.338 region:rollup2
CONTROL.

01:26:47.402 --> 01:26:52.674 region:rollup2
AND AND UTILITY DISTRICTS AS IT

01:26:50.338 --> 01:26:54.476 region:rollup2
AS IT RENDERS PROPERTY PROPERTY

01:26:52.674 --> 01:26:56.311 region:rollup2
USEFUL IN DEVELOPABLE.

01:26:54.476 --> 01:26:57.913 region:rollup2
AND AND THE BALANCING FACTOR IN

01:26:56.311 --> 01:26:59.748 region:rollup2
BOTH INSTANCES FROM MY FROM MY

01:26:57.913 --> 01:27:01.349 region:rollup2
POSITION IS NATURE.

01:26:59.748 --> 01:27:04.386 region:rollup2
NATURE IS CHANGING WHICH

01:27:01.349 --> 01:27:05.620 region:rollup2
REQUIRES A RESPONSE.

01:27:04.386 --> 01:27:06.988 region:rollup2
BUT AT THE SAME TIME YOU KNOW I

01:27:05.620 --> 01:27:08.990 region:rollup2
DON'T.

01:27:06.988 --> 01:27:10.625 region:rollup2
I'M NOT.

01:27:08.990 --> 01:27:11.593 region:rollup2
FOR A BAILOUT AND I DON'T

01:27:10.625 --> 01:27:12.828 region:rollup2
NECESSARILY.

01:27:11.593 --> 01:27:14.362 region:rollup2
<u><c.green>THAT'S WHAT I'M GONNA BE</c></u>

01:27:12.828 --> 01:27:15.697 region:rollup2
LOOKING FOR IN THIS COMMITTEE

01:27:14.362 --> 01:27:17.232 region:rollup2
ANYTHING THAT THAT.

01:27:15.697 --> 01:27:17.833 region:rollup2
TRANSLATES INTO A BAILOUT

01:27:17.232 --> 01:27:18.867 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I DON'T THINK MALE AT

01:27:17.833 --> 01:27:20.035 region:rollup2
ITS.

01:27:18.867 --> 01:27:21.570 region:rollup2
AND THIS IN THIS ISSUE ARE

01:27:20.035 --> 01:27:22.904 region:rollup2
NECESSARY.

01:27:21.570 --> 01:27:25.640 region:rollup2
I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD RUSH TO

01:27:22.904 --> 01:27:27.709 region:rollup2
DECISION THAT EITHER CONTRIBUTES

01:27:25.640 --> 01:27:30.011 region:rollup2
TO A A BAILOUT QUARRY OR IN ANY

01:27:27.709 --> 01:27:32.681 region:rollup2
WAY GIVES PROPERTY OWNERS --

01:27:30.011 --> 01:27:34.249 region:rollup2
TO COURT DO RECOURSE TO TO OUR

01:27:32.681 --> 01:27:35.650 region:rollup2
RECOVER THEIR REMEDIES AND I

01:27:34.249 --> 01:27:39.154 region:rollup2
THINK THAT THE DECISION THAT

01:27:35.650 --> 01:27:40.589 region:rollup2
WE'VE SEEN FIVE LEGAL COUNSEL.

01:27:39.154 --> 01:27:43.925 region:rollup2
SHOWS THAT WE HAVE WE HAVE

01:27:40.589 --> 01:27:45.827 region:rollup2
LIMITED ABILITY TO EVEN --

01:27:43.925 --> 01:27:47.496 region:rollup2
AFFECT.

01:27:45.827 --> 01:27:48.997 region:rollup2
INVERSE CONDEMNATION AND IF WE

01:27:47.496 --> 01:27:51.399 region:rollup2
TRIED AYE I DON'T THINK WOULD

01:27:48.997 --> 01:27:52.367 region:rollup2
PREVAIL BUT NONE THE LESS I

01:27:51.399 --> 01:27:54.136 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND THE CONCEPT I MEAN

01:27:52.367 --> 01:27:55.437 region:rollup2
THE RELATED.

01:27:54.136 --> 01:27:57.439 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S THAT'S AN AREA THAT

01:27:55.437 --> 01:27:59.608 region:rollup2
WE SHOULD JUST UP.

01:27:57.439 --> 01:28:02.744 region:rollup2
A IF IF WE DO WE DO ANYTHING IT

01:27:59.608 --> 01:28:04.012 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE LOOKING AT THAT AS WHO

01:28:02.744 --> 01:28:07.949 region:rollup2
THE FOR THE THAT THE THE THE

01:28:04.012 --> 01:28:08.750 region:rollup2
RELATED ISSUE.

01:28:07.949 --> 01:28:08.950 region:rollup2
PERCENT THAT.

01:28:08.750 --> 01:28:10.519 region:rollup2
BOAT.

01:28:08.950 --> 01:28:11.920 region:rollup2
RACE.

01:28:10.519 --> 01:28:12.921 region:rollup2
ON THE SURFACE GOV --

01:28:11.920 --> 01:28:14.623 region:rollup2
I'VE ENJOYED OUR ROBUST ROBUST

01:28:12.921 --> 01:28:16.892 region:rollup2
CONVERSATIONS WE'VE HAD US

01:28:14.623 --> 01:28:18.560 region:rollup2

I'M YOU ARE TO BE SOMEBODY WHO

01:28:22.130 --> 01:28:24.266 region:rollup2
WILL -- IN

01:28:23.031 --> 01:28:25.967 region:rollup2
REGARDS THE DOCTRINE OF THE

01:28:24.266 --> 01:28:27.702 region:rollup2
INVERSE CONDEMNATION --

01:28:25.967 --> 01:28:29.504 region:rollup2
SOME HIS WILL READ STUDIED ON

01:28:27.702 --> 01:28:31.106 region:rollup2
AND AND UNDERSTANDS IT NOW WHICH

01:28:29.504 --> 01:28:31.706 region:rollup2
IS ALWAYS VERY NICE WHEN THERE'S

01:28:31.106 --> 01:28:33.108 region:rollup2
AN ATTORNEY THAT ACTUALLY GETS

01:28:31.706 --> 01:28:33.975 region:rollup2
THIS -- NO

01:28:33.108 --> 01:28:36.311 region:rollup2
OFFENSE TO THE ATTORNEYS IN THE

01:28:33.975 --> 01:28:39.815 region:rollup2
ROOM -- SO I

01:28:36.311 --> 01:28:41.783 region:rollup2
pIN REGARDS --

01:28:39.815 --> 01:28:44.219 region:rollup2
TO INVERSE CONDEMNATION AND THE

01:28:41.783 --> 01:28:45.554 region:rollup2
AND THE LIABILITY I'M QUESTION.

01:28:44.219 --> 01:28:46.688 region:rollup2
ARE THERE ANY DIFFERENCES

01:28:45.554 --> 01:28:48.590 region:rollup2
BETWEEN.

01:28:46.688 --> 01:28:50.025 region:rollup2
THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES AND

01:28:48.590 --> 01:28:52.594 region:rollup2
THE PUBLIC PUBLICLY OWNED

01:28:50.025 --> 01:28:54.796 region:rollup2
UTILITIES AND IF THERE ARE WHAT

01:28:52.594 --> 01:28:55.964 region:rollup2
ARE THEY OKAY GREAT QUESTION.

01:28:54.796 --> 01:28:57.365 region:rollup2
AND THIS IS WHAT I THINK IS THE

01:28:55.964 --> 01:28:58.500 region:rollup2
HEART OF THESE ISSUES --

01:28:57.365 --> 01:28:59.801 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF THE STANDARDS

01:28:58.500 --> 01:29:00.635 region:rollup2
THEMSELVES THE LIABILITY

01:28:59.801 --> 01:29:02.704 region:rollup2
STANDARDS IN COURT THERE'S NO

01:29:00.635 --> 01:29:04.206 region:rollup2
DIFFERENCE.

01:29:02.704 --> 01:29:05.240 region:rollup2
WHAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS

01:29:04.206 --> 01:29:06.508 region:rollup2
DONE?

01:29:05.240 --> 01:29:08.210 region:rollup2
HAS DECIDED THAT IS GOING TO

01:29:06.508 --> 01:29:10.612 region:rollup2
TAKE ITS.

01:29:08.210 --> 01:29:12.948 region:rollup2
INHERENT EMINENT DOMAIN POWERS.

01:29:10.612 --> 01:29:14.449 region:rollup2
AND GIFT SOME OF THOSE WHO LOST

01:29:12.948 --> 01:29:15.050 region:rollup2
COOLEY TEACH A BUNDLE OF STICKS

01:29:14.449 --> 01:29:18.453 region:rollup2
ARE GONNA GIFT YOU A BUNDLE OF

01:29:15.050 --> 01:29:20.288 region:rollup2
STICKS TO DEMO USER PO USE.

01:29:18.453 --> 01:29:22.490 region:rollup2
THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT THE STATE

01:29:20.288 --> 01:29:24.426 region:rollup2
OF CALIFORNIA HELD BACK THE

01:29:22.490 --> 01:29:25.794 region:rollup2
POWER TO PASS THROUGH OR

01:29:24.426 --> 01:29:27.062 region:rollup2
SOCIALIZE ON TO REPAIRS.

01:29:25.794 --> 01:29:29.531 region:rollup2
AND THAT IS WHERE MUCH OF THE

01:29:27.062 --> 01:29:31.733 region:rollup2
CONSTERNATION WITH I USE EXISTS

01:29:29.531 --> 01:29:33.969 region:rollup2
IS THAT THIS CITY CALIFORNIA

01:29:31.733 --> 01:29:35.770 region:rollup2
GIFTED THEM THE ABILITY TO HAVE

01:29:33.969 --> 01:29:37.272 region:rollup2
EMINENT DOMAIN POWER AND BUILD

01:29:35.770 --> 01:29:40.141 region:rollup2
THESE MASSIVE ELECTRICAL GRIDS.

01:29:37.272 --> 01:29:43.612 region:rollup2
BUT THEY HELD BACK IN THE CPUC

01:29:40.141 --> 01:29:45.614 region:rollup2
VIS OUR AUTHORITY --

01:29:43.612 --> 01:29:46.348 region:rollup2
TO TO PASS ON TO RATEPAYERS OR

01:29:45.614 --> 01:29:47.616 region:rollup2
TO DO SOMETHING LIKE

01:29:46.348 --> 01:29:49.184 region:rollup2
SECURITIZATION OR SOMETHING LIKE

01:29:47.616 --> 01:29:51.319 region:rollup2
THAT AND THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE

01:29:49.184 --> 01:29:52.587 region:rollup2
BETWEEN PO USING I'LL USE ON A

01:29:51.319 --> 01:29:54.356 region:rollup2
MIXTURE A CLEAR BUT IN REGARDS

01:29:52.587 --> 01:29:56.024 region:rollup2
TO LIABILITIES THERE ISN'T ANY

01:29:54.356 --> 01:29:57.325 region:rollup2
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PEEL USE

01:29:56.024 --> 01:29:57.525 region:rollup2
AND THE I'LL USE NOT THAT I'M

01:29:57.325 --> 01:30:02.430 region:rollup2
AWARE.

01:29:57.525 --> 01:30:04.566 region:rollup2
OF IT THANK YOU.

AND AYE I WAS HOPING TO MAKE

01:32:33.415 --> 01:32:37.886 region:rollup2
THREE POINTS THIS AFTERNOON.

01:32:34.816 --> 01:32:38.720 region:rollup2
FIRST TO TALK ABOUT WHY A CHANGE

01:32:37.886 --> 01:32:41.456 region:rollup2
TO THE STANDARD FOR INVERSE

01:32:38.720 --> 01:32:44.292 region:rollup2
CONDEMNATION GOING FORWARD IS

01:32:41.456 --> 01:32:46.428 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT FOR OUR STATE --

01:32:44.292 --> 01:32:48.263 region:rollup2
UNDER THE STRICT LIABILITY

01:32:46.428 --> 01:32:50.131 region:rollup2
STANDARD WHAT THAT MEANS IS THE

01:32:48.263 --> 01:32:52.400 region:rollup2
UTILITY IS LIABLE FOR ALL

01:32:50.131 --> 01:32:54.903 region:rollup2
PROPERTY DAMAGE FROM A WILDFIRE

01:32:52.400 --> 01:32:57.505 region:rollup2
IGNITED BY ITS FACILITIES.

01:32:54.903 --> 01:32:58.606 region:rollup2
EVEN IF THE UTILITY WAS WITHOUT

01:32:57.505 --> 01:33:01.009 region:rollup2
FAULT.

01:32:58.606 --> 01:33:02.644 region:rollup2
AND FOLLOWED ALL OF THE RULES.

01:33:01.009 --> 01:33:05.146 region:rollup2
AND EVEN IF THE SPREAD OF THE

01:33:02.644 --> 01:33:06.581 region:rollup2
FIRE WAS DUE TO CIRCUMSTANCES.

01:33:05.146 --> 01:33:07.982 region:rollup2
SUCH AS WIND AND WEATHER THAT

01:33:06.581 --> 01:33:09.684 region:rollup2
ARE OUTSIDE THE UTILITIES

01:33:07.982 --> 01:33:11.186 region:rollup2
CONTROL IN EFFECT.

01:33:09.684 --> 01:33:13.855 region:rollup2
THIS MAKES UTILITIES THE

01:33:11.186 --> 01:33:14.989 region:rollup2
INSURERS OF LAST RESORT.

01:33:13.855 --> 01:33:18.460 region:rollup2
THE RESULTING COSTS TO THE

01:33:14.989 --> 01:33:21.262 region:rollup2
UTILITIES CAN BE ENORMOUS AND

01:33:18.460 --> 01:33:22.997 region:rollup2
CONSEQUENCES EXTREMELY NEGATIVE.

01:33:21.262 --> 01:33:25.667 region:rollup2
NOT JUST FOR THE UTILITIES.

01:33:22.997 --> 01:33:28.136 region:rollup2
BUT ALSO FOR THEIR CUSTOMERS AND

01:33:25.667 --> 01:33:29.137 region:rollup2
FOR THE STATE HOUSEHOLD.

01:33:28.136 --> 01:33:31.739 region:rollup2
A STANDARD THAT IMPOSES

01:33:29.137 --> 01:33:33.641 region:rollup2
LIABILITY BASED ON WHETHER THE

01:33:31.739 --> 01:33:35.443 region:rollup2
UTILITY ACTED REASONABLY.

01:33:33.641 --> 01:33:38.646 region:rollup2
WOULD BE FAIR FOR CUSTOMERS AN

01:33:35.443 --> 01:33:41.049 region:rollup2
ALLIANCE LIABILITY WITH FAULT.

01:33:38.646 --> 01:33:43.218 region:rollup2
SECOND I'D LIKE TO TOUCH ON THE

01:33:41.049 --> 01:33:45.487 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE'S CONSTITUTIONAL

01:33:43.218 --> 01:33:47.589 region:rollup2
AUTHORITY TO ADOPT A

01:33:45.487 --> 01:33:49.157 region:rollup2

INVERSE CONDEMNATION CASES

01:33:49.157 --> 01:33:52.327 region:rollup2
ARISING FROM WILDFIRES AT FIRST

01:33:51.493 --> 01:33:54.295 region:rollup2
I'D LIKE TO EMPHASIZE THE

01:33:52.327 --> 01:33:57.332 region:rollup2
DISTINCTION.

01:33:54.295 --> 01:33:59.200 region:rollup2
BETWEEN THE ELIMINATION OF

01:33:57.332 --> 01:34:00.335 region:rollup2
INVERSE CONDEMNATION WHICH THE

01:33:59.200 --> 01:34:02.837 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE CANNOT TO ON THE

01:34:00.335 --> 01:34:04.672 region:rollup2
CONSTITUTION.

01:34:02.837 --> 01:34:06.407 region:rollup2
VERSUS THE ADOPTION OF THE

01:34:04.672 --> 01:34:08.076 region:rollup2
STANDARD THAT WOULD BE APPLIED

01:34:06.407 --> 01:34:10.578 region:rollup2
TO DETERMINE WHEN INVERSE

01:34:08.076 --> 01:34:12.313 region:rollup2
LIABILITY EXISTS AND THAT IS

01:34:10.578 --> 01:34:15.183 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT THE LEGISLATURE

01:34:12.313 --> 01:34:16.618 region:rollup2
DEFINITELY DOES HAVE A ROLAND.

01:34:15.183 --> 01:34:18.453 region:rollup2
AS PROFESSOR WARRANT TESTIFIED

01:34:19.954 --> 01:34:24.659 region:rollup2
COURT HAS REPEATEDLY SAID.

01:34:23.091 --> 01:34:28.129 region:rollup2
THAT THE COURTS MUST GIVE GREAT

01:34:24.659 --> 01:34:29.130 region:rollup2
WEIGHT. TO THE LEGISLATURE'S

01:34:28.129 --> 01:34:30.732 region:rollup2
INTERPRETATION OF THE

01:34:29.130 --> 01:34:32.333 region:rollup2
CONSTITUTION UNLESS THAT

01:34:30.732 --> 01:34:34.135 region:rollup2
INTERPRETATION.

01:34:32.333 --> 01:34:36.504 region:rollup2
IS CLEARLY CONTRARY TO THE

01:34:34.135 --> 01:34:37.772 region:rollup2
LANGUAGE OF THE CONSTITUTION

01:34:36.504 --> 01:34:39.340 region:rollup2
ANOTHER WORDS WHEN THE

01:34:37.772 --> 01:34:40.308 region:rollup2
CONSTITUTION IS AMBIGUOUS.

01:34:39.340 --> 01:34:41.976 region:rollup2
AND CAN BE INTERPRETED IN

01:34:40.308 --> 01:34:43.711 region:rollup2
VARIOUS WAYS.

01:34:41.976 --> 01:34:44.913 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATURE HAS THE

01:34:43.711 --> 01:34:46.781 region:rollup2
PREROGATIVE TO SELECT AN

01:34:44.913 --> 01:34:48.349 region:rollup2
INTERPRETATION AND THE COURTS

01:34:46.781 --> 01:34:50.084 region:rollup2
WILL GIVE GREAT WEIGHT TO THAT

01:34:48.349 --> 01:34:50.852 region:rollup2
CHOICE AND THAT'S ESPECIALLY

01:34:50.084 --> 01:34:52.587 region:rollup2
TRUE.

01:34:50.852 --> 01:34:54.989 region:rollup2
WHEN THAT INTERPRETATION IS

01:34:52.587 --> 01:34:55.757 region:rollup2
BASED ON POLICY CONSIDERATIONS

01:34:54.989 --> 01:34:57.392 region:rollup2
WITH THE LAW WHICH THE

01:34:55.757 --> 01:35:00.995 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE IS BETTER POSITION

01:34:57.392 --> 01:35:03.598 region:rollup2
THAN THE COURTS TO MAKE?

01:35:00.995 --> 01:35:05.967 region:rollup2
THE CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISION ON

01:35:03.598 --> 01:35:08.369 region:rollup2
CONVERSE CON CONDEMNATION.

01:35:05.967 --> 01:35:10.204 region:rollup2
IS AMBIGUOUS ON THE STANDARD OF

01:35:08.369 --> 01:35:12.106 region:rollup2
LIABILITY.

01:35:10.204 --> 01:35:13.708 region:rollup2
THE LANGUAGE SILENCE ON THAT

01:35:12.106 --> 01:35:15.009 region:rollup2
QUESTION THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME

01:35:13.708 --> 01:35:16.945 region:rollup2
COURT.

01:35:15.009 --> 01:35:18.780 region:rollup2
HAS SUPPLIED THREE DIFFERENT

01:35:16.945 --> 01:35:21.349 region:rollup2
STANDARDS OVER TIME.

01:35:18.780 --> 01:35:22.917 region:rollup2
ORIGINALLY THE STANDARD WAS THAT

01:35:21.349 --> 01:35:24.986 region:rollup2
THE GOVERNMENT COULD BE LIABLE

01:35:22.917 --> 01:35:26.387 region:rollup2
IN INVERSE CONDEMNATION ONLY ONE

01:35:24.986 --> 01:35:27.789 region:rollup2
A PRIVATE PARTY COULD BE LIABLE

01:35:26.387 --> 01:35:28.489 region:rollup2
IN OTHER WORDS ONLY IF THERE WAS

01:35:27.789 --> 01:35:30.158 region:rollup2
NEGLIGENCE OR INTENTIONAL

01:35:28.489 --> 01:35:32.293 region:rollup2
CONDUCT.

01:35:30.158 --> 01:35:34.062 region:rollup2
THEN THE COURT ADOPTED A STRICT

01:35:32.293 --> 01:35:35.563 region:rollup2
LIABILITY STANDARD.

01:35:34.062 --> 01:35:37.198 region:rollup2
AND LATER STILL THE COURT%

01:35:35.563 --> 01:35:38.700 region:rollup2
ADOPTED A REASONABLENESS

01:35:37.198 --> 01:35:40.401 region:rollup2
STANDARD IN THE FLOOD CONTROL

01:35:38.700 --> 01:35:42.270 region:rollup2
CASES.

01:35:40.401 --> 01:35:43.838 region:rollup2
OR I'D LIKE TO EMPHASIZETHAT

01:35:42.270 --> 01:35:46.407 region:rollup2
THERE'S TWO SEPARATE QUESTIONS

01:35:43.838 --> 01:35:48.776 region:rollup2
HERE ONE IS DOES THE LEGISLATURE

01:35:46.407 --> 01:35:50.645 region:rollup2
HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO ADOPT AN

01:35:48.776 --> 01:35:51.646 region:rollup2
INTERPRETATION THAT IS.

01:35:50.645 --> 01:35:53.114 region:rollup2
IS THE LANGUAGE OF THE

01:35:51.646 --> 01:35:54.549 region:rollup2
CONSTITUTION BROAD ENOUGH TO

01:35:53.114 --> 01:35:56.251 region:rollup2
PERMIT THE ADOPTION OF A

01:35:54.549 --> 01:35:58.119 region:rollup2
REASONABLENESS STANDARD.

01:35:56.251 --> 01:35:59.187 region:rollup2
CLEARLY THE ANSWER IS YES SUITS

01:35:58.119 --> 01:36:00.488 region:rollup2
ARE HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT

01:35:59.187 --> 01:36:02.190 region:rollup2
INTERPRETATIONS OVER TIME BY THE

01:36:00.488 --> 01:36:03.424 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA COURTS.

01:36:02.190 --> 01:36:06.094 region:rollup2
AS WELL AS INTERPRETATIONS BY

01:36:03.424 --> 01:36:07.528 region:rollup2
OTHER STATES A SECOND QUESTION

01:36:06.094 --> 01:36:09.163 region:rollup2
IS SHOULD.

01:36:07.528 --> 01:36:11.499 region:rollup2
WE LEGISLATOR ADOPT A

01:36:09.163 --> 01:36:13.601 region:rollup2
REASONABLENESS STANDARD AND HERE

01:36:11.499 --> 01:36:16.237 region:rollup2
I WOULD SUBMIT THAT THE BALANCE

01:36:13.601 --> 01:36:17.538 region:rollup2
OF INTERESTS THAT WAS UNDERLYING

01:36:16.237 --> 01:36:18.573 region:rollup2
THE FLOOD CONTROL CASES IS

01:36:17.538 --> 01:36:20.208 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY RELEVANT BUT

01:36:18.573 --> 01:36:21.943 region:rollup2
FUNDAMENTALLY.

01:36:20.208 --> 01:36:23.978 region:rollup2
THAT IS THE POLICY QUESTION THAT

01:36:21.943 --> 01:36:26.014 region:rollup2
THIS BODY THE LEGISLATURE IS

01:36:23.978 --> 01:36:28.216 region:rollup2
CALLED UPON TO MAKE AND WHEN THE

01:36:26.014 --> 01:36:29.384 region:rollup2
COURTS MADE THESE DECISIONS

01:36:28.216 --> 01:36:31.152 region:rollup2
ABOUT WHAT STANDARD SHOULD BE

01:36:29.384 --> 01:36:32.754 region:rollup2
APPLIED.

01:36:31.152 --> 01:36:34.522 region:rollup2
THEY WERE DOING SO BASED ON

01:36:32.754 --> 01:36:35.657 region:rollup2
POLICY CONSIDERATIONS BUT

01:36:34.522 --> 01:36:38.493 region:rollup2
WITHOUT GUIDANCE FROM THE

01:36:35.657 --> 01:36:39.927 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE.

01:36:38.493 --> 01:36:42.130 region:rollup2
IT IS THE LEGISLATURE'S ROLE

01:36:39.927 --> 01:36:44.332 region:rollup2
UNDER OUR CONSTITUTIONAL SYSTEM

01:36:42.130 --> 01:36:46.467 region:rollup2
TO MAKE POLICY JUDGMENTS.

01:36:44.332 --> 01:36:46.868 region:rollup2
AND THE COURTS ARE VERY INCLINED

01:36:46.467 --> 01:36:49.170 region:rollup2
TO DEFER TO THOSE

01:36:46.868 --> 01:36:51.406 region:rollup2
DETERMINATIONS.

01:36:49.170 --> 01:36:52.940 region:rollup2
A REASONABLENESS STANDARD FOR

01:36:51.406 --> 01:36:54.642 region:rollup2
INVERSE CONDEMNATION CASES

01:36:52.940 --> 01:36:56.711 region:rollup2
INVOLVING WILDFIRES.

01:36:54.642 --> 01:36:58.179 region:rollup2
ALLIANCE WITH THE INTERPRETATION

01:36:56.711 --> 01:37:00.014 region:rollup2
THAT THE COURT ADOPTED IN THOSE

01:36:58.179 --> 01:37:02.383 region:rollup2
FLOOD CONTROL CASES AND IS

01:37:00.014 --> 01:37:03.551 region:rollup2
SUPPORTED BY SIMILAR POLICY

01:37:02.383 --> 01:37:06.120 region:rollup2
RATIONALES.

01:37:03.551 --> 01:37:07.822 region:rollup2
WILDFIRE RISKS REQUIRE A

01:37:06.120 --> 01:37:09.590 region:rollup2
BALANCING OF THE BENEFITS OF

01:37:07.822 --> 01:37:11.159 region:rollup2
EXTENDING ELECTRIC SERVICE TO

01:37:09.590 --> 01:37:12.493 region:rollup2
ALL AREAS OF THE STATE.

01:37:11.159 --> 01:37:16.164 region:rollup2
AGAINST THE RISKS THAT THOSE

01:37:12.493 --> 01:37:18.232 region:rollup2
FACILITIES MIDNIGHT A FIRE AT

01:37:16.164 --> 01:37:20.835 region:rollup2
FINALLY I'D LIKE TO EMPHASIZE

01:37:18.232 --> 01:37:23.504 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:37:20.835 --> 01:37:24.906 region:rollup2
THESE THE SHIFT FROM A STRICT

01:37:23.504 --> 01:37:26.841 region:rollup2
LIABILITY STANDARD TO A

01:37:24.906 --> 01:37:30.545 region:rollup2
REASONABLENESS STANDARD.

01:37:26.841 --> 01:37:32.113 region:rollup2
WOULD NOT RESULT IN ADVERSE

01:37:30.545 --> 01:37:33.948 region:rollup2
INCENTIVES TO MAINTAIN THE

01:37:32.113 --> 01:37:35.683 region:rollup2

COULD STILL BE HELD LIABLE IF

01:37:39.087 --> 01:37:43.091 region:rollup2
THEY ACTED NEGLIGENTLY.

01:37:40.888 --> 01:37:45.259 region:rollup2
COULD BE HELD LIABLE IF THEY

01:37:43.091 --> 01:37:47.528 region:rollup2
ACTED UNREASONABLY.

01:37:45.259 --> 01:37:48.329 region:rollup2
AND IS COULD STILL BE PENALIZED

01:37:47.528 --> 01:37:50.298 region:rollup2

P. GINNY.

01:43:56.330 --> 01:43:58.432 region:rollup2
FOR TWENTY SEVENTEEN IT'S ABOUT

01:43:56.964 --> 01:44:00.167 region:rollup2
FUTURE FIRES WITH UTILITY DID

01:43:58.432 --> 01:44:01.435 region:rollup2
NOTHING WRONG.

01:44:00.167 --> 01:44:02.470 region:rollup2
AND THE QUESTION IS SHOULD THEY

NEVER LESS HAVE TO PAY AUTOMATIC

01:44:02.470 --> 01:44:06.173 region:rollup2

01:44:04.538 --> 01:44:08.709 region:rollup2
WELL WHEN A COMPANY PAYS

01:44:06.173 --> 01:44:09.210 region:rollup2
AUTOMATIC DAMAGES TO SOMEONE AND

01:44:08.709 --> 01:44:11.112 region:rollup2
DID NOTHING WRONG THAT'S

01:44:09.210 --> 01:44:12.480 region:rollup2
INSURANCE.

01:44:11.112 --> 01:44:14.415 region:rollup2
SHOULD THE UTILITY BE THE

01:44:12.480 --> 01:44:17.084 region:rollup2
INSURER HERE OR SHOULD INSURANCE

01:44:14.415 --> 01:44:18.652 region:rollup2
COMPANIES BE THE INSURERS.

01:44:17.084 --> 01:44:19.787 region:rollup2
OF COURSE THE VICTIMS NEED TO BE

01:44:18.652 --> 01:44:22.123 region:rollup2
MADE WHOLE THE QUESTION IS BY

01:44:19.787 --> 01:44:22.890 region:rollup2
WHOM.

01:44:22.123 --> 01:44:25.259 region:rollup2
NOW IT WOULD CLEARLY HAVE A

01:44:22.890 --> 01:44:27.461 region:rollup2
PROBLEM WITH UNDERINSURED AND

01:44:25.259 --> 01:44:28.729 region:rollup2
UNINSURED PEOPLE.

01:44:27.461 --> 01:44:29.730 region:rollup2
BUT WEHAVE THE PROBLEM WITH THE

01:44:28.729 --> 01:44:31.398 region:rollup2
CURRENT FIRES THAT ARE GOING NOW

01:44:29.730 --> 01:44:31.999 region:rollup2
ON NIGHT NOW.

01:44:31.398 --> 01:44:33.767 region:rollup2
THAT HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH

01:44:31.999 --> 01:44:35.069 region:rollup2
UTILITIES AND WE HAVE TO ADDRESS

01:44:33.767 --> 01:44:37.138 region:rollup2
THAT PROBLEM [inaudible]

01:44:35.069 --> 01:44:38.539 region:rollup2
BUT HERE.

01:44:37.138 --> 01:44:40.541 region:rollup2
SAYING THAT THE UTILITY SHOULD

01:44:38.539 --> 01:44:42.143 region:rollup2
BE THE INSURER FOR SOME FUTURE

01:44:40.541 --> 01:44:44.211 region:rollup2
FIRES IS NOT A SUSTAINABLE

01:44:42.143 --> 01:44:45.346 region:rollup2
POLICY.

01:44:44.211 --> 01:44:46.247 region:rollup2
THAT'S THE STATE WILL POLICY FOR

01:44:45.346 --> 01:44:48.115 region:rollup2
THREE REASONS [inaudible]

01:44:46.247 --> 01:44:49.450 region:rollup2
FIRST.

01:44:48.115 --> 01:44:51.619 region:rollup2
IT'S GOING TO RESULT IN MORE

01:44:49.450 --> 01:44:53.721 region:rollup2
FIRES NOT LESS.

01:44:51.619 --> 01:44:55.422 region:rollup2
ON TUESDAY I TESTIFIED AND OTHER

01:44:53.721 --> 01:44:57.324 region:rollup2
PEOPLE TESTIFIED ABOUT THE

01:44:55.422 --> 01:44:59.760 region:rollup2
IMPORTANCE OF HARDENING THE

01:44:57.324 --> 01:45:00.661 region:rollup2
SYSTEM ABOUT THINGS LIKE MICRO

01:44:59.760 --> 01:45:04.131 region:rollup2
GRIDS AND STRONGER CONDUCTORS.

01:45:00.661 --> 01:45:05.266 region:rollup2
AND STRONGER POLLS AND BETTER

01:45:04.131 --> 01:45:06.567 region:rollup2
WEATHER FORECASTING IN A NUMBER

01:45:05.266 --> 01:45:08.135 region:rollup2
OF OTHER THINGS.

01:45:06.567 --> 01:45:10.371 region:rollup2
THEY ALL COST MONEY.

01:45:08.135 --> 01:45:11.305 region:rollup2
IT'S WORTH IT.

01:45:10.371 --> 01:45:13.174 region:rollup2
BUT IT WOULD REQUIRE LOTS OF

01:45:11.305 --> 01:45:14.809 region:rollup2
UTILITY INVESTMENT.

01:45:13.174 --> 01:45:16.877 region:rollup2
AND UTILITIES CAN'T RAISE THE

01:45:14.809 --> 01:45:19.113 region:rollup2
MONEY TO MAKE THE INVESTMENT TO

01:45:16.877 --> 01:45:20.414 region:rollup2
MAKE THE AT THE SYSTEM SAFER.

01:45:19.113 --> 01:45:22.650 region:rollup2
IF THEY'RE SPENDING THEIR MONEY

01:45:20.414 --> 01:45:24.084 region:rollup2
PAYING INSURANCE CLAIMS.

01:45:22.650 --> 01:45:25.853 region:rollup2
IT WILL BE MUCH BETTER TO SPEND

01:45:24.084 --> 01:45:26.854 region:rollup2
THE MONEY ON PREVENTION RATHER

01:45:25.853 --> 01:45:28.823 region:rollup2
THAN MAKING UTILITIES THE

01:45:26.854 --> 01:45:30.291 region:rollup2
INSURERS.

01:45:28.823 --> 01:45:31.625 region:rollup2
LET'S HAVE THE UTILITIES MAKE

01:45:30.291 --> 01:45:32.793 region:rollup2
THEIR SYSTEM IS BETTER AND

01:45:31.625 --> 01:45:35.629 region:rollup2
INSURANCE COMPANIES MAKE

01:45:32.793 --> 01:45:36.697 region:rollup2
INSURANCE BETTER.

01:45:35.629 --> 01:45:38.265 region:rollup2
SECOND REASON UTILITIES CAN'T BE

01:45:36.697 --> 01:45:40.434 region:rollup2
THE INSURERS.

01:45:38.265 --> 01:45:42.203 region:rollup2
REPAIRS CAN AFFORD IT.

01:45:40.434 --> 01:45:44.238 region:rollup2
RATEPAYERS CANNOT BE THE IT FIRE

01:45:42.203 --> 01:45:45.372 region:rollup2
INSURERS FOR THE STATE.

01:45:44.238 --> 01:45:46.640 region:rollup2
NOW IT'S VERY TEMPTING TO SAY

01:45:45.372 --> 01:45:48.309 region:rollup2
THE TO THE SHAREHOLDERS SHOULD

01:45:46.640 --> 01:45:49.376 region:rollup2
PAY THE VICTIMS NOT THE RATE

01:45:48.309 --> 01:45:50.477 region:rollup2
PAYERS.

01:45:49.376 --> 01:45:51.579 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S THE LAW WHEN THE

01:45:50.477 --> 01:45:53.013 region:rollup2
UTILITY WAS NOT REASONABLE AND

01:45:51.579 --> 01:45:53.614 region:rollup2
PRUDENT.

01:45:53.013 --> 01:45:55.182 region:rollup2
AND NO ONE IS SAYING THAT THAT

01:45:53.614 --> 01:45:56.584 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE CHANGED.

01:45:55.182 --> 01:45:58.018 region:rollup2
AND THE COUNTRY AND TUESDAY.

01:45:56.584 --> 01:45:59.887 region:rollup2
I SAID THAT WE SHOULD USE THE

01:45:58.018 --> 01:46:01.322 region:rollup2
UTILITY SAFETY PLANS AS THE

01:45:59.887 --> 01:46:03.591 region:rollup2
STANDARD TO DETERMINE IF UTILITY

01:46:01.322 --> 01:46:04.491 region:rollup2
WAS NEGLIGENT.

01:46:03.591 --> 01:46:05.759 region:rollup2
BUT EVEN IF YOU THINK THAT

01:46:04.491 --> 01:46:07.428 region:rollup2
SHAREHOLDERS SHOULD BE THE

01:46:05.759 --> 01:46:10.130 region:rollup2
INSURER IT WILL STILL END UP

01:46:07.428 --> 01:46:10.698 region:rollup2
COSTING THE RATEPAYERS.

01:46:10.130 --> 01:46:12.333 region:rollup2
WE'VE HEARD IT SEVERAL TIMES

01:46:10.698 --> 01:46:13.934 region:rollup2
TODAY ALREADY THEIR BOND STATUS

01:46:12.333 --> 01:46:15.836 region:rollup2
IS NOW ONE STEP ABOVE JUNK BOND

01:46:13.934 --> 01:46:17.071 region:rollup2
STATUS IT ALREADY COSTING

01:46:15.836 --> 01:46:18.973 region:rollup2
RATEPAYERS MORE MONEY IN

01:46:17.071 --> 01:46:19.506 region:rollup2
FINANCING COSTS.

01:46:18.973 --> 01:46:20.608 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE HIGHER COST OF

01:46:19.506 --> 01:46:22.276 region:rollup2
BORROWING.

01:46:20.608 --> 01:46:24.144 region:rollup2
IF WE DON'T FIX STRICT LIABILITY

01:46:22.276 --> 01:46:25.312 region:rollup2
IT WILL BE EVENMORE EXPENSIVE

01:46:24.144 --> 01:46:26.647 region:rollup2
TO RAISE THE DEBT AND EQUITY

01:46:25.312 --> 01:46:27.581 region:rollup2
FINANCING NECESSARY.

01:46:26.647 --> 01:46:29.817 region:rollup2
AND RATEPAYERS WILL BE PAYING

01:46:27.581 --> 01:46:30.818 region:rollup2
THOSE COSTS.

01:46:29.817 --> 01:46:32.219 region:rollup2
SO READ THIS REALLY NO WAY

01:46:30.818 --> 01:46:34.121 region:rollup2
AROUND IT IF THE UTILITY HAS

01:46:32.219 --> 01:46:35.589 region:rollup2
STRICT LIABILITY.

01:46:34.121 --> 01:46:37.992 region:rollup2
IT IS AN INSURER AND IT WILL

01:46:35.589 --> 01:46:39.360 region:rollup2
COST RATEPAYERS.

01:46:37.992 --> 01:46:40.928 region:rollup2
A THIRD REASON WHY UTILITIES

01:46:39.360 --> 01:46:41.795 region:rollup2
CAN'T BE THE INSURERS.

01:46:40.928 --> 01:46:43.931 region:rollup2
IT WILL UNDERMINE CALIFORNIA

01:46:41.795 --> 01:46:45.1000 region:rollup2
POLICIES.

01:46:43.931 --> 01:46:47.768 region:rollup2
WE'VE GOT THE RP A SYSTEM WHICH

01:46:45.1000 --> 01:46:49.670 region:rollup2
HAS BEEN EXTREMELY SUCCESSFUL.

01:46:47.768 --> 01:46:51.272 region:rollup2
AND IS IT WORK BECAUSE THE

01:46:49.670 --> 01:46:51.739 region:rollup2
UTILITIES HAVE SIGNED CONTRACTS

01:46:51.272 --> 01:46:52.606 region:rollup2
WITH RENEWABLE ENERGY

01:46:51.739 --> 01:46:53.908 region:rollup2
DEVELOPERS.

01:46:52.606 --> 01:46:55.542 region:rollup2
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF THOSE

01:46:53.908 --> 01:46:57.011 region:rollup2
CONTRACTS YOU CAN'T DO IT IF

01:46:55.542 --> 01:46:57.578 region:rollup2
YOU'RE ALSO SPEND YOUR MONEY ON

01:46:57.011 --> 01:46:59.213 region:rollup2
INSURANCE AND YOU DON'T HAVE

01:46:57.578 --> 01:47:00.314 region:rollup2
CREDIT.

01:46:59.213 --> 01:47:02.082 region:rollup2
WE GOT ENERGY EFFICIENCY

01:47:00.314 --> 01:47:03.183 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS EVERY YEAR THE UTILITY

01:47:02.082 --> 01:47:04.752 region:rollup2
SPENT A BILLION DOLLARS AND

01:47:03.183 --> 01:47:05.819 region:rollup2
ENERGY EFFICIENCY.

01:47:04.752 --> 01:47:07.688 region:rollup2
THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO RAISE

01:47:05.819 --> 01:47:09.723 region:rollup2
MONEY TO DO THAT.

01:47:07.688 --> 01:47:11.625 region:rollup2
WE'RE NOW IN PARKING AND THE THE

01:47:09.723 --> 01:47:12.993 region:rollup2
MOST IMPORTANT REMAINING LEG OF

01:47:11.625 --> 01:47:15.095 region:rollup2
OUR CLIMATE CHANGE POLICY THAT

01:47:12.993 --> 01:47:16.330 region:rollup2
IS ELECTRIFYING TRANSPORTATION.

01:47:15.095 --> 01:47:17.998 region:rollup2
UTILITIES HAVE BEEN AUTHORIZED

01:47:16.330 --> 01:47:19.266 region:rollup2
ALREADY TO SPEND ABOUT A BILLION

01:47:17.998 --> 01:47:20.534 region:rollup2
DOLLARS TO BUILD UP THAT

01:47:19.266 --> 01:47:21.735 region:rollup2
CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE

01:47:20.534 --> 01:47:23.637 region:rollup2
NEED THERE ARE MORE APPLICATIONS

01:47:21.735 --> 01:47:24.972 region:rollup2
PENDING.

01:47:23.637 --> 01:47:27.007 region:rollup2
THEY CAN'T DO IT IF I HAVE TO

01:47:24.972 --> 01:47:29.777 region:rollup2
SPEND THEIR MONEY INSURANCE.

01:47:27.007 --> 01:47:32.212 region:rollup2
IT WOULD BE A TRAGIC OUTCOME.

01:47:29.777 --> 01:47:34.949 region:rollup2
IF CALIFORNIA CLIMATE POLICIES

01:47:32.212 --> 01:47:35.482 region:rollup2
BECOME A BIG VITIM OF WILDFIRES

01:47:34.949 --> 01:47:37.451 region:rollup2
THAT ARE DRIVEN BY CLIMATE

01:47:35.482 --> 01:47:39.520 region:rollup2
CHANGE [inaudible]

01:47:37.451 --> 01:47:40.788 region:rollup2
FINALLY.

01:47:39.520 --> 01:47:41.989 region:rollup2
WITH A NUMBER OF TIMES IN THE

01:47:40.788 --> 01:47:42.656 region:rollup2
PREVIOUS HEARINGS WE'VE TALKED

01:47:41.989 --> 01:47:45.759 region:rollup2
ABOUT EXPANDING BIOMASS

01:47:42.656 --> 01:47:47.695 region:rollup2
GENERATION. TO GET THOSE PLANTS

01:47:45.759 --> 01:47:48.495 region:rollup2
BUILT.

01:47:47.695 --> 01:47:51.598 region:rollup2
WE NEEDED TO LEASES SIGNED

01:47:48.495 --> 01:47:53.233 region:rollup2
CONTRACTS TO BY THE ELECTRICITY.

01:47:51.598 --> 01:47:54.802 region:rollup2
UTILITIES ARE NOT FINANCIALLY

01:47:53.233 --> 01:47:56.403 region:rollup2
HEALTHY THEY CAN'T SIGN THOSE

01:47:54.802 --> 01:47:58.405 region:rollup2
CONTRACTS IN THE CAPITAL'S

01:47:56.403 --> 01:48:00.874 region:rollup2
PLANTS BUILT.

01:47:58.405 --> 01:48:02.776 region:rollup2
SO DON'T BE DISTRACTED.

01:48:00.874 --> 01:48:04.345 region:rollup2
FIXING STRICT LIABILITY IS NOT

01:48:02.776 --> 01:48:05.279 region:rollup2
BAILING OUT THE UTILITY.

01:48:04.345 --> 01:48:06.780 region:rollup2
IT'S SPENDING MONEY ON

01:48:05.279 --> 01:48:08.916 region:rollup2
PREVENTION INSTEAD OF ON

01:48:06.780 --> 01:48:10.084 region:rollup2
INSURANCE IT'S PROTECTING

01:48:08.916 --> 01:48:10.918 region:rollup2
RATEPAYERS.

01:48:10.084 --> 01:48:13.287 region:rollup2
AND IS PROTECTING CALIFORNIA

01:48:10.918 --> 01:48:14.755 region:rollup2
CLIMATE POLICIES [inaudible]

01:48:13.287 --> 01:48:15.089 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

01:48:14.755 --> 01:48:16.190 region:rollup2
THANK YOU --

01:48:15.089 --> 01:48:17.858 region:rollup2

THANK YOU.

01:48:17.858 --> 01:48:20.894 region:rollup2
THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I I

01:48:19.426 --> 01:48:22.262 region:rollup2
THINK MISTER JOSEPH HIT SOME OF

01:48:20.894 --> 01:48:23.630 region:rollup2
THE POINTS I WANTED TO MAKE I'M

01:48:22.262 --> 01:48:25.432 region:rollup2
CHANCE BUT HE JONES WITH THE

01:48:23.630 --> 01:48:26.934 region:rollup2
INDEPENDENT ENERGY PRODUCERS --

01:48:25.432 --> 01:48:28.068 region:rollup2
AND I REALLY DO UNDERSTAND THE

01:48:26.934 --> 01:48:28.702 region:rollup2
GRAVITY OF THIS --

01:48:28.068 --> 01:48:30.838 region:rollup2
THE WORK THAT'S BEING DONE HERE

01:48:28.702 --> 01:48:33.207 region:rollup2
--

01:48:30.838 --> 01:48:34.641 region:rollup2
AND MY PURPOSES YOU KNOW MY MY

01:48:33.207 --> 01:48:35.809 region:rollup2
ASSOCIATION US ALL OF US HAVE

01:48:34.641 --> 01:48:37.544 region:rollup2
PERSONAL EXPERIENCES WITH

01:48:35.809 --> 01:48:38.712 region:rollup2
WILDFIRES MY MEMBER COMPANIES

01:48:37.544 --> 01:48:39.313 region:rollup2
HAVE --

01:48:38.712 --> 01:48:41.348 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF THEIR EMPLOYEES HAVE

01:48:39.313 --> 01:48:43.016 region:rollup2
--

01:48:41.348 --> 01:48:47.388 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY HAD THEIR HOMES BURNED

01:48:43.016 --> 01:48:48.822 region:rollup2
IN PREVIOUS OF WELL AWARE OF AS

01:48:47.388 --> 01:48:50.357 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANCE OF WILDFIRES IN

01:48:48.822 --> 01:48:52.326 region:rollup2
THEIR IMPACT ON PEOPLE --

01:48:50.357 --> 01:48:53.494 region:rollup2
THE PURPOSE OF MY TESTIMONY

01:48:52.326 --> 01:48:55.029 region:rollup2
TODAY'S IS IT IS ACTUALLY

01:48:53.494 --> 01:48:55.662 region:rollup2
SOMEWHAT SECONDARY TO WHAT

01:48:55.029 --> 01:48:57.097 region:rollup2
YOU'VE HEARD FROM THE PREVIOUS

01:48:55.662 --> 01:48:58.565 region:rollup2
VOTES -- AND

01:48:57.097 --> 01:49:00.567 region:rollup2
IT BUILDS OFF I THINK WITH MR

01:48:58.565 --> 01:49:02.569 region:rollup2
JOSEPH JUST INDICATED A WHICH IS

01:49:00.567 --> 01:49:03.737 region:rollup2
THE IMPACT IMPLICATIONS OF

01:49:02.569 --> 01:49:05.806 region:rollup2
STRICT LIABILITY --

01:49:03.737 --> 01:49:07.941 region:rollup2
APPLICATION OF A DENVER'S

01:49:05.806 --> 01:49:08.542 region:rollup2
COMBINATION ON OTHER POLICIES

01:49:07.941 --> 01:49:11.278 region:rollup2
THAT -- THAT

01:49:08.542 --> 01:49:12.112 region:rollup2
THE THIS LEGISLATURE HAS ADOPTED

01:49:11.278 --> 01:49:13.347 region:rollup2
IN WHERE WE NEED TO GO IN THE

01:49:12.112 --> 01:49:14.848 region:rollup2
FUTURE -- WE

01:49:13.347 --> 01:49:16.216 region:rollup2
HAVE GENERALLY SUPPORTED THE

01:49:14.848 --> 01:49:17.985 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR'S --

01:49:16.216 --> 01:49:19.453 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL HERE LARGELY BECAUSE

01:49:17.985 --> 01:49:21.255 region:rollup2
HIS WORDS ON PAPER --

01:49:19.453 --> 01:49:23.190 region:rollup2
THAT IT BASICALLY GIVES US SOME

01:49:21.255 --> 01:49:24.491 region:rollup2
FOCUS TO A DEBATE WHICH ACTUALLY

01:49:23.190 --> 01:49:26.160 region:rollup2
IS STARTED HERE TODAY WITH

01:49:24.491 --> 01:49:28.629 region:rollup2
RESPECT --

01:49:26.160 --> 01:49:28.896 region:rollup2
TO THE ISSUES AROUND --

01:49:28.629 --> 01:49:31.165 region:rollup2
AROUND --

01:49:28.896 --> 01:49:34.968 region:rollup2
WHETHER.

01:49:31.165 --> 01:49:36.670 region:rollup2
TROW AREA IS CITY AND IT'S ALL

01:49:34.968 --> 01:49:38.005 region:rollup2
THE SILT UP TO THE LEGISLATURE

01:49:36.670 --> 01:49:38.672 region:rollup2
TO SORT THAT OUT AND FIGURE OUT

01:49:38.005 --> 01:49:40.474 region:rollup2
IF THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S

01:49:38.672 --> 01:49:42.342 region:rollup2
HELPFUL OR NOT WITH RESPECT TO

01:49:40.474 --> 01:49:43.877 region:rollup2
THE COURTS BEING ABLE TO REVIEW

01:49:42.342 --> 01:49:44.845 region:rollup2
THIS IN THE FUTURE --

01:49:43.877 --> 01:49:46.480 region:rollup2
WE BELIEVE OBVIOUSLY EVERYBODY

01:49:44.845 --> 01:49:47.681 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR

01:49:46.480 --> 01:49:48.982 region:rollup2
ACT ACTIONS OR IN ACTIONS THAT

01:49:47.681 --> 01:49:50.384 region:rollup2
THEY'VE ACTUALLY DONE --

01:49:48.982 --> 01:49:51.785 region:rollup2
SO WE'RE NOT THAT BASICALLY

01:49:50.384 --> 01:49:54.121 region:rollup2
ASKING FOR ANY SAYS TYPE OF

01:49:51.785 --> 01:49:55.889 region:rollup2
IMMUNITY AS MANY OF YOU KNOW --

01:49:54.121 --> 01:49:57.858 region:rollup2
WE REPRESENT A BROAD RANGE OF

01:49:55.889 --> 01:49:59.393 region:rollup2
THAT TECHNOLOGIES BIOMASS WIND

01:49:57.858 --> 01:50:01.128 region:rollup2
SOLAR GEOTHERMAL --

01:49:59.393 --> 01:50:01.762 region:rollup2
AND AND NATURAL GAS THESE

01:50:01.128 --> 01:50:04.298 region:rollup2
PROJECTS HAVE LARGELY BEEN BUILT

01:50:01.762 --> 01:50:06.400 region:rollup2
--

01:50:04.298 --> 01:50:07.868 region:rollup2
BY A CALIFORNIA POLICIES --

01:50:06.400 --> 01:50:10.104 region:rollup2
AND ARE BASICALLY --

01:50:07.868 --> 01:50:11.805 region:rollup2
BUILT UNDER CONTRACT WITH THE

01:50:10.104 --> 01:50:13.373 region:rollup2
STATE'S UTILITIES SO WE'RE VERY

01:50:11.805 --> 01:50:15.075 region:rollup2
SENSITIVE TO FINANCIAL STABILITY

01:50:13.373 --> 01:50:16.276 region:rollup2
HERE -- THE

01:50:15.075 --> 01:50:18.312 region:rollup2
POLICIES THAT THIS GUY IS

01:50:16.276 --> 01:50:19.980 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE'S ADOPTED TO ADDRESS

CLIMATE CHANGE ARE EXTREMELY

01:50:19.980 --> 01:50:22.316 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT AND THEY ARE IN FACT

01:50:21.548 --> 01:50:24.251 region:rollup2
WORKING.

01:50:22.316 --> 01:50:26.987 region:rollup2
US ARRAY NOW THE ELECTRIC SECTOR

01:50:24.251 --> 01:50:28.355 region:rollup2
IS 29% BELOW NINETEEN NINETY

01:50:26.987 --> 01:50:30.190 region:rollup2
LEVELS WITH RESPECT TO ITS

01:50:28.355 --> 01:50:31.859 region:rollup2
CARBON EMISSIONS ARE OUR PS

01:50:30.190 --> 01:50:33.861 region:rollup2
POLICIES IS 30% --

01:50:31.859 --> 01:50:36.697 region:rollup2
BASICALLY RETAIL SALES CURRENTLY

01:50:33.861 --> 01:50:37.631 region:rollup2
WE'RE GOING 250% BY --

01:50:36.697 --> 01:50:38.699 region:rollup2
TWENTY THIRTY WE'VE GOT A NUMBER

01:50:37.631 --> 01:50:40.667 region:rollup2
OF OTHER PROGRAMS THAT ARE

01:50:38.699 --> 01:50:42.369 region:rollup2
DESIGNED AROUND --

01:50:40.667 --> 01:50:44.137 region:rollup2
ROOFTOP APPLICATIONS DEMAND

01:50:42.369 --> 01:50:46.940 region:rollup2
RESPONSE THOSE KINDS OF THINGS

01:50:44.137 --> 01:50:48.308 region:rollup2
VERY IMPORTANT --

01:50:46.940 --> 01:50:53.180 region:rollup2
AS INDICATED EARLIER ALL --

01:50:48.308 --> 01:50:53.780 region:rollup2
THE UTILITIES.

01:50:53.180 --> 01:50:54.781 region:rollup2
THE THAT'S OCCURRING RIGHT NOW

01:50:53.780 --> 01:50:56.216 region:rollup2
--

01:50:54.781 --> 01:50:57.651 region:rollup2
WITH RESPECT TO THE RATING

01:50:56.216 --> 01:51:00.020 region:rollup2
AGENCIES ALL THREE HAVE BEEN

01:50:57.651 --> 01:51:01.455 region:rollup2
DOWNGRADED THIS GOES DOWN HILL

01:51:00.020 --> 01:51:03.323 region:rollup2
ONE OF MY MEMBER COMPANIES TOPAZ

01:51:01.455 --> 01:51:05.092 region:rollup2
SOLAR WAS DOWNGRADED BECAUSE PGD

01:51:03.323 --> 01:51:07.261 region:rollup2
WAS DOWNGRADED --

01:51:05.092 --> 01:51:08.996 region:rollup2
AND ARE BASICALLY --

01:51:07.261 --> 01:51:10.831 region:rollup2
THERE DUH FUTURE CREDIT RATING

01:51:08.996 --> 01:51:12.166 region:rollup2
IS IS CONTINGENT UPON WHERE PGD

01:51:10.831 --> 01:51:13.967 region:rollup2
ENDS UP --

01:51:12.166 --> 01:51:15.269 region:rollup2
SO BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

01:51:13.967 --> 01:51:17.070 region:rollup2
WE'RE HOPEFUL HERE IS A WORK F

01:51:15.269 --> 01:51:18.505 region:rollup2
THE COULD COMMITTEE NOT ONLY ON

01:51:17.070 --> 01:51:19.273 region:rollup2
THIS ISSUE BUT AND THE YOUR

01:51:18.505 --> 01:51:21.074 region:rollup2
GENERAL WORK.

01:51:19.273 --> 01:51:21.708 region:rollup2
BASICALLY HELP STABILIZE SOME OF

01:51:21.074 --> 01:51:22.709 region:rollup2
THE UNCERTAINTY THAT'S OUT THERE

01:51:21.708 --> 01:51:24.444 region:rollup2
--

01:51:22.709 --> 01:51:26.013 region:rollup2
I WANNA BE CLEAR THAT ALL OF

01:51:24.444 --> 01:51:28.448 region:rollup2
THESE COSTS --

01:51:26.013 --> 01:51:30.717 region:rollup2
THAT AS THESE COSTS ASSOCIATED

01:51:28.448 --> 01:51:31.718 region:rollup2
WITH FALL --

01:51:30.717 --> 01:51:33.420 region:rollup2
WITH A CREDIT RATINGS FALLING.

01:51:31.718 --> 01:51:34.821 region:rollup2
RATE PAYERS PAY MORE THEY'RE

01:51:33.420 --> 01:51:36.123 region:rollup2
GOING TO PAY MORE FOR RENEWABLE

01:51:34.821 --> 01:51:37.424 region:rollup2
PROJECTS TO GOING TO PAY MORE

01:51:36.123 --> 01:51:38.625 region:rollup2
FOR THE REPLACEMENT POLLS ARE

01:51:37.424 --> 01:51:41.094 region:rollup2
GOING TO PAY MORE FOR ELECTRIC

01:51:38.625 --> 01:51:43.964 region:rollup2
VEHICLES --

01:51:41.094 --> 01:51:45.065 region:rollup2
ELECTRIC BILL.

01:51:43.964 --> 01:51:46.767 region:rollup2
OKAY IS THAT --

01:51:45.065 --> 01:51:48.902 region:rollup2
THERE THERE IT ONE WAY OR THE

01:51:46.767 --> 01:51:51.171 region:rollup2
OTHER THE RATEPAYERS ARE A PIECE

01:51:48.902 --> 01:51:53.006 region:rollup2
OF THIS AND I THINK AS MISTER --

01:51:51.171 --> 01:51:54.641 region:rollup2
ORCHARD HAS INDICATED I MISS MY

01:51:53.006 --> 01:51:56.577 region:rollup2
CUSTOMER I RECOGNIZED EFFECTIVE

01:51:54.641 --> 01:51:58.145 region:rollup2
SMUD I HAS A FIRE IN THEIR

01:51:56.577 --> 01:51:59.780 region:rollup2
TRANSMISSION LINE I IS A RATE

01:51:58.145 --> 01:52:00.948 region:rollup2
PAYER OF* ARE ARE GOING TO

01:51:59.780 --> 01:52:02.149 region:rollup2
PICK P THE PIECES THAT.

01:52:00.948 --> 01:52:03.784 region:rollup2
ARE THE DIFFERENCES AND I THINK

01:52:02.149 --> 01:52:06.520 region:rollup2
MR FISKE APPOINTED ON A VERY

01:52:03.784 --> 01:52:08.222 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE IS THAT THE

01:52:06.520 --> 01:52:09.189 region:rollup2
I USE HAVE THE THE P. YOU SEE

01:52:08.222 --> 01:52:11.091 region:rollup2
STANDING BETWEEN THEM AND

01:52:09.189 --> 01:52:12.993 region:rollup2
ABILITY AUTOMATICALLY PASSES ON

01:52:11.091 --> 01:52:14.227 region:rollup2
SO IT IT IS WHAT IT IS THAT'S

01:52:12.993 --> 01:52:15.229 region:rollup2
THE WORLD WE LIVE IN --

01:52:14.227 --> 01:52:16.763 region:rollup2
AND SO I THINK --

01:52:15.229 --> 01:52:18.265 region:rollup2
THE BEST THAT WE CAN DO IS TO

01:52:16.763 --> 01:52:18.832 region:rollup2
SEE IF WE CAN --

01:52:18.265 --> 01:52:20.701 region:rollup2
TRIED TO ADDRESS SOME THE

01:52:18.832 --> 01:52:21.902 region:rollup2
SHORTCOMINGS ONE OF THE AREAS

01:52:20.701 --> 01:52:23.704 region:rollup2
THAT I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR ON

01:52:21.902 --> 01:52:25.005 region:rollup2
AS WE ARE YPERSENSITIVE TO THE

01:52:23.704 --> 01:52:26.573 region:rollup2
ISSUE OF BANKRUPTCY.

01:52:25.005 --> 01:52:27.841 region:rollup2
BUT UTILITY GOES BANKRUPT AND I

01:52:26.573 --> 01:52:29.576 region:rollup2
KNOW THE PEOPLE ARE SUGGESTING

01:52:27.841 --> 01:52:31.178 region:rollup2
THAT THAT WILL NEVERHAPPEN IT

01:52:29.576 --> 01:52:32.112 region:rollup2
HAS HAPPENED IN THE PAST WE'RE

01:52:31.178 --> 01:52:32.879 region:rollup2
MINDFUL OF IT HAPPENS IN THE

01:52:32.112 --> 01:52:34.648 region:rollup2
FUTURE.

01:52:32.879 --> 01:52:35.182 region:rollup2
THAT'S A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT THE

01:52:34.648 --> 01:52:36.550 region:rollup2
CONTRACTS THAT HAVE BEEN

01:52:35.182 --> 01:52:38.051 region:rollup2
EXECUTED WITH MY MEMBER

01:52:36.550 --> 01:52:39.253 region:rollup2
COMPANIES LARGE NUMBER OF THEM

01:52:38.051 --> 01:52:41.021 region:rollup2
WILL GO AWAY.

01:52:39.253 --> 01:52:44.491 region:rollup2
BANKRUPTCY --

01:52:41.021 --> 01:52:45.859 region:rollup2
JUDGES AND REFEREES IT IS THIS

01:52:44.491 --> 01:52:47.561 region:rollup2
THAT WITH ALL DUE RESPECT THAT

01:52:45.859 --> 01:52:49.563 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE'S PUT FORWARD THEIR

01:52:47.561 --> 01:52:51.298 region:rollup2
JOB IS TO CREDITORS AND

01:52:49.563 --> 01:52:52.266 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY WE WANT TO AVOID THAT

01:52:51.298 --> 01:52:53.567 region:rollup2
SO -- THE

01:52:52.266 --> 01:52:55.168 region:rollup2
LONG TERM IMPACTS OF SUCH AN

01:52:53.567 --> 01:52:56.870 region:rollup2
OUTCOME WOULD HAVE DEVASTATING

01:52:55.168 --> 01:52:58.038 region:rollup2
IMPACTS I THINK OVERALL AND SO

01:52:56.870 --> 01:52:59.973 region:rollup2
THE POLICY --

01:52:58.038 --> 01:53:01.541 region:rollup2
OBJECTIVES WE HAVE A AND HERE SO

01:52:59.973 --> 01:53:03.276 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW IN CLOSING HERE THE

01:53:01.541 --> 01:53:04.745 region:rollup2
REALITY IS IS THAT THERE'S A

01:53:03.276 --> 01:53:06.046 region:rollup2
THERE'S A LOT OF TALK THAT --

01:53:04.745 --> 01:53:07.280 region:rollup2
I MUST GET TO SENSE THAT DID

01:53:06.046 --> 01:53:08.515 region:rollup2
THEIR PARTY SAID BELIEVE THERE'S

01:53:07.280 --> 01:53:10.317 region:rollup2
SOME SORT OF MAGIC MONEY OUT

01:53:08.515 --> 01:53:12.285 region:rollup2
THERE THERE ISN'T ONE WAY OR THE

01:53:10.317 --> 01:53:13.620 region:rollup2
OTHER THIS MONEY IS GOING TO BE

01:53:12.285 --> 01:53:14.955 region:rollup2
WHETHER IT'S DIRECTLY PAID BY

01:53:13.620 --> 01:53:16.156 region:rollup2
THE RATE PAYERS OR WHETHER IT'S

01:53:14.955 --> 01:53:17.090 region:rollup2
PAID BY INCREASED INSURANCE

01:53:16.156 --> 01:53:19.559 region:rollup2
COSTS.

01:53:17.090 --> 01:53:20.994 region:rollup2
OR IF THE UTILITIES GO AWAY --

01:53:19.559 --> 01:53:23.664 region:rollup2
WHATEVER REPLACES THEM --

01:53:20.994 --> 01:53:25.198 region:rollup2
THIS IS A MAJOR PUBLIC PROBLEM

01:53:23.664 --> 01:53:26.500 region:rollup2
THAT WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER

01:53:25.198 --> 01:53:28.302 region:rollup2
AND THAT WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO

01:53:26.500 --> 01:53:29.403 region:rollup2
FIGURE THAT OUT AND AGAIN NO ONE

01:53:28.302 --> 01:53:30.937 region:rollup2
IS TALKING ABOUT LEADING THE

01:53:29.403 --> 01:53:32.939 region:rollup2
UTILITIES OFF THE HOOK --

01:53:30.937 --> 01:53:34.241 region:rollup2
WE WERE HOPING THAT LEGISLATIVE

01:53:32.939 --> 01:53:35.809 region:rollup2
GUIDANCE WOULD HELP COURTS

01:53:34.241 --> 01:53:37.544 region:rollup2
MOVING FORWARD WE RECOGNIZE THE

01:53:35.809 --> 01:53:38.645 region:rollup2
FACT THAT THERE IS A DIVISION OF

01:53:37.544 --> 01:53:38.845 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT HERE AND IF IT'S YOU

01:53:38.645 --> 01:53:40.647 region:rollup2
KNOW.

01:53:38.845 --> 01:53:42.049 region:rollup2
UNCONSTITUTIONAL I'M SURE YOU'LL

01:53:40.647 --> 01:53:43.884 region:rollup2
BE TOLD --

01:53:42.049 --> 01:53:45.485 region:rollup2
AND YOU KNOW HOPEFULLY THE IT

01:53:43.884 --> 01:53:46.753 region:rollup2
WOULD WE ARE MAIN GOAL HERE IS.

01:53:45.485 --> 01:53:47.921 region:rollup2
THE WORK OF THIS COMMITTEE NEEDS

01:53:46.753 --> 01:53:50.157 region:rollup2
TO BASICALLY STABILIZE THE

01:53:47.921 --> 01:53:52.526 region:rollup2
MARKETS --

01:53:50.157 --> 01:53:55.796 region:rollup2
AND WE ARE EXPECTATIONS IS A

01:53:52.526 --> 01:53:56.963 region:rollup2
HARDENING OF THE COOLEY UP

01:53:55.796 --> 01:53:58.365 region:rollup2
POLICIES THAT --

01:53:56.963 --> 01:54:00.233 region:rollup2
TO RESULT IN AND I THINK AND

01:53:58.365 --> 01:54:02.369 region:rollup2
WE'RE VERY SENSITIVE --

01:54:00.233 --> 01:54:03.770 region:rollup2
TO THE MEETING THE NEEDS OF FIRE

01:54:02.369 --> 01:54:04.071 region:rollup2
VICTIMS THANK THANK YOU

YOU KNOW I SEE THIS --

01:54:19.052 --> 01:54:22.322 region:rollup2
CONFERENCE COMMITTEE --

01:54:21.254 --> 01:54:24.658 region:rollup2
ACTING IN A QUASI JUDICIAL WAY

01:54:22.322 --> 01:54:26.226 region:rollup2
HERE.

01:54:24.658 --> 01:54:27.794 region:rollup2
AS WE HEAR YOUR TESTIMONY AS WE

01:54:26.226 --> 01:54:29.896 region:rollup2
HEAR THE TESTIMONY OF OF PRIOR

01:54:27.794 --> 01:54:34.801 region:rollup2
PANELS [inaudible]

01:54:29.896 --> 01:54:36.369 region:rollup2
AND I'M NOT AN ATTORNEY.

01:54:34.801 --> 01:54:39.506 region:rollup2
THERE ARE SOME HERE THAT HAVE

01:54:36.369 --> 01:54:40.507 region:rollup2
BETTER TOOLS --

01:54:39.506 --> 01:54:41.942 region:rollup2
EDUCATION LATER TO GUIDE US

01:54:40.507 --> 01:54:42.809 region:rollup2
THROUGH THE PROCESS SO I SEE

01:54:41.942 --> 01:54:44.111 region:rollup2
THINGS.

01:54:42.809 --> 01:54:47.180 region:rollup2
AS THE PHARMACISTS LITTLE BIT

01:54:44.111 --> 01:54:51.084 region:rollup2
MORE KIND OF BLACK AND WHITE.

01:54:47.180 --> 01:54:52.452 region:rollup2
AND I I CAN TELL YOU THAT AS A A

01:54:51.084 --> 01:54:56.156 region:rollup2
GUIDE HAS BEEN IN BUSINESS FOR

01:54:52.452 --> 01:54:57.457 region:rollup2
MYSELF FOR THIRTY FIVE YEARS.

01:54:56.156 --> 01:54:59.793 region:rollup2
AND PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST

01:54:57.457 --> 01:55:01.661 region:rollup2
OVER REGULATED PROFESSIONS THAT

01:54:59.793 --> 01:55:03.196 region:rollup2
BEING PHARMACY AND THEN COMPOUND

01:55:01.661 --> 01:55:05.165 region:rollup2
PHARMACY AND THEN STERILE

01:55:03.196 --> 01:55:07.100 region:rollup2
COMPOUND PHARMACY THAT.

01:55:05.165 --> 01:55:09.469 region:rollup2
IF I DIDN'T --

01:55:07.100 --> 01:55:10.871 region:rollup2
CHANGE.

01:55:09.469 --> 01:55:13.840 region:rollup2
THE PRACTICE LETTER I'VE BEEN

01:55:10.871 --> 01:55:15.675 region:rollup2
INVOLVED WITH. FOR TWENTY FIVE

01:55:13.840 --> 01:55:15.976 region:rollup2
YEARS IDEA TO BUSINESS

01:55:15.675 --> 01:55:19.012 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

01:55:15.976 --> 01:55:19.980 region:rollup2
AND SO --

01:55:19.012 --> 01:55:21.915 region:rollup2
MISTER WEISSMAN A COUPLE OF

01:55:19.980 --> 01:55:23.917 region:rollup2
ISSUES I'D LIKE.

01:55:21.915 --> 01:55:25.852 region:rollup2
TO SHARE WITH YOU AND GET YOUR

01:55:23.917 --> 01:55:27.187 region:rollup2
YOUR RESPONSE.

01:55:25.852 --> 01:55:28.388 region:rollup2
THE FIRST ONE IS SAYING YOU HAD

01:55:27.187 --> 01:55:30.023 region:rollup2
MENTIONED --

01:55:28.388 --> 01:55:32.192 region:rollup2
THE ON THE GOVERNOR'S --

01:55:30.023 --> 01:55:33.760 region:rollup2
A LINE IN THE SAND DISCUSSING

01:55:32.192 --> 01:55:35.729 region:rollup2
TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN AND

01:55:33.760 --> 01:55:38.331 region:rollup2
AND I FIND THAT.

01:55:35.729 --> 01:55:40.133 region:rollup2
RATHER OFFENSIVE BECAUSE I KNOW

01:55:38.331 --> 01:55:42.035 region:rollup2
THAT WE'VE HAD A A SIGNIFICANT

01:55:40.133 --> 01:55:43.670 region:rollup2
LOSS OF PROPERTY IN LIFE AND IN

01:55:42.035 --> 01:55:45.105 region:rollup2
MY COLLEAGUES DISTRICT AND THE

01:55:43.670 --> 01:55:46.773 region:rollup2
IN MANSIO.

01:55:45.105 --> 01:55:47.507 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THAT THE PANEL

01:55:46.773 --> 01:55:49.443 region:rollup2
BEFORE.

01:55:47.507 --> 01:55:52.479 region:rollup2
OF THE CONSUMER ATTORNEY MADE A

01:55:49.443 --> 01:55:53.246 region:rollup2
VERY GOOD CASE THAT.

01:55:52.479 --> 01:55:55.248 region:rollup2
WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT INVERSE

01:55:53.246 --> 01:55:58.385 region:rollup2
CONDEMNATION OR TALKING ABOUT

01:55:55.248 --> 01:56:00.620 region:rollup2
INTENDED USE AS DESIGNED?

01:55:58.385 --> 01:56:03.490 region:rollup2
NOW THAT'S NOT.

01:56:00.620 --> 01:56:06.159 region:rollup2
IN ONE MOMENT IN TIME.

01:56:03.490 --> 01:56:08.228 region:rollup2
THAT IS PROBABLY EIGHT LIVING.

01:56:06.159 --> 01:56:09.162 region:rollup2
SCENARIO WHERE WE HAVE TO ADJUST

01:56:08.228 --> 01:56:10.597 region:rollup2
WITH THE TIMES MY COLLEAGUE

01:56:09.162 --> 01:56:12.699 region:rollup2
BRINGS UP THE FACT THAT WE HAVE

01:56:10.597 --> 01:56:15.569 region:rollup2
CLIMATE CHANGE WE DO.

01:56:12.699 --> 01:56:16.903 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THAT'S INCUMBENT ON

01:56:15.569 --> 01:56:19.372 region:rollup2
THE UTILITIES.

01:56:16.903 --> 01:56:21.475 region:rollup2
TO REBUILD MODIFY.

01:56:19.372 --> 01:56:22.909 region:rollup2
SO THAT THE INTENDED USE IS

01:56:21.475 --> 01:56:24.144 region:rollup2
DESIGNED TO TO CONVEY

01:56:22.909 --> 01:56:26.213 region:rollup2
ELECTRICITY.

01:56:24.144 --> 01:56:28.548 region:rollup2
AND TO ENSURE MAXIMUM SAFETY.

CAUSED BY EXTERNAL FACTORS AND

02:01:58.244 --> 02:02:00.914 region:rollup2
YET WE HAD THE ATTORNEY COME UP

02:01:59.746 --> 02:02:02.482 region:rollup2
AND TALK ABOUT THE CAR THAT HIT

02:02:00.914 --> 02:02:03.516 region:rollup2
THE POLLS SAYS YOU KNOW.

02:02:02.482 --> 02:02:04.684 region:rollup2
THAT YOU WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE SO

02:02:03.516 --> 02:02:07.453 region:rollup2
I THINK THERE'S A DIFFERENCE OF

02:02:04.684 --> 02:02:09.856 region:rollup2
LEGAL LOOK OPINIONS AND I'M NOT

02:02:07.453 --> 02:02:10.390 region:rollup2
SURE THAT THIS BODY IS GOING TO

02:02:09.856 --> 02:02:11.424 region:rollup2
BE ABLE TO ARBITRATE THOSE

02:02:10.390 --> 02:02:14.527 region:rollup2
DIFFERENCES [inaudible]

02:02:11.424 --> 02:02:17.430 region:rollup2
ASSEMBLYMEMBER REYES.

02:02:14.527 --> 02:02:19.132 region:rollup2
THANK YOU MISTER.

02:02:17.430 --> 02:02:20.500 region:rollup2
I THEIR TO COMMENTS THAT WERE

02:02:19.132 --> 02:02:22.936 region:rollup2
MADE.

02:02:20.500 --> 02:02:24.204 region:rollup2
AND I JUST WANT TO ADDRESS --

02:02:22.936 --> 02:02:25.271 region:rollup2
MISTER WEISMAN ONE OF THE

02:02:24.204 --> 02:02:27.974 region:rollup2
COMMENTS YOU MADE [inaudible]

02:02:25.271 --> 02:02:28.474 region:rollup2
IS THAT IF YOU CHANGE STRICT

02:02:27.974 --> 02:02:31.611 region:rollup2
LIABILITY TO REASONABLE

02:02:28.474 --> 02:02:33.513 region:rollup2
STANDARD.

02:02:31.611 --> 02:02:35.481 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD NOT DISINCENTIVE EYES

02:02:33.513 --> 02:02:37.750 region:rollup2
UTILITIES TO MAINTAIN SAFETY AND

02:02:35.481 --> 02:02:39.118 region:rollup2
PREVENTION.

02:02:37.750 --> 02:02:41.387 region:rollup2
BUT IT'S FRUSTRATING FOR ME TO

02:02:39.118 --> 02:02:44.324 region:rollup2
KNOW THAT.

02:02:41.387 --> 02:02:45.758 region:rollup2
WE HAD STRICT LIABILITY AND IT

02:02:44.324 --> 02:02:47.493 region:rollup2
PREVENTION WAS NOT TAKEN CARE OF

02:02:45.758 --> 02:02:47.994 region:rollup2
AND WE FIND OURSELVES WHO WE ARE

02:02:47.493 --> 02:02:50.196 region:rollup2
NOW AND IF WE LOWER THE

02:02:47.994 --> 02:02:51.898 region:rollup2
STANDARD.

02:02:50.196 --> 02:02:54.901 region:rollup2
HOW HOWARD WHAT'S THE INCENTIVE

02:02:51.898 --> 02:02:57.070 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE? TO DO THOSE THINGS

02:02:54.901 --> 02:02:58.771 region:rollup2
THAT NEED TO BE DONE FOR SAFETY

02:02:57.070 --> 02:02:59.739 region:rollup2
FOR PREVENTION IF.

02:02:58.771 --> 02:03:02.141 region:rollup2
THERE WASN'T ENOUGH INCENTIVE

02:02:59.739 --> 02:03:03.676 region:rollup2
BEFORE.

02:03:02.141 --> 02:03:06.212 region:rollup2
SO ASSEMBLY MEMBER THERE'S A FEW

02:03:03.676 --> 02:03:08.681 region:rollup2
RESPONSES I WOULD OFFER FIRST OF

02:03:06.212 --> 02:03:10.450 region:rollup2
ALL -- AGAIN.

02:03:08.681 --> 02:03:12.418 region:rollup2
WERE AS PART OF A COMPREHENSIVE

02:03:10.450 --> 02:03:13.286 region:rollup2
SOLUTION TO UTILITIES NEED TO

02:03:12.418 --> 02:03:17.223 region:rollup2
CHANGE THEIR SYSTEMS AND

02:03:13.286 --> 02:03:18.091 region:rollup2
PRACTICES. TO REDUCE THESE RISKS

02:03:17.223 --> 02:03:18.958 region:rollup2
AND AND THAT IS A VERY IMPORTANT

02:03:18.091 --> 02:03:20.827 region:rollup2
PART.

02:03:18.958 --> 02:03:21.961 region:rollup2
OF THE OVERALL PROGRAM AND AND A

02:03:20.827 --> 02:03:23.596 region:rollup2
VERY IMPORTANT PART OF THE

02:03:21.961 --> 02:03:25.565 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IN THE CASE

02:03:23.596 --> 02:03:27.300 region:rollup2
OF INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES

02:03:25.565 --> 02:03:27.900 region:rollup2
UNDER THE SUPERVISION AND

02:03:27.300 --> 02:03:28.868 region:rollup2
DIRECTION OF THE PUBLIC

02:03:27.900 --> 02:03:29.168 region:rollup2
UTILITIES COMMISSION

02:03:28.868 --> 02:03:32.872 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

02:03:29.168 --> 02:03:35.942 region:rollup2
BUT I WOULD GO FURTHER AND SAY.

02:03:32.872 --> 02:03:37.977 region:rollup2
IF THE LEGISLATURE WERE TO ADOPT

02:03:35.942 --> 02:03:39.445 region:rollup2
THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL ON IN

02:03:37.977 --> 02:03:41.481 region:rollup2
FIRST CONDEMNATION.

02:03:39.445 --> 02:03:43.016 region:rollup2
UTILITIES REMAIN LIABLE FOR

02:03:41.481 --> 02:03:44.817 region:rollup2
NEGLIGENCE AND FOR FUN

02:03:43.016 --> 02:03:46.719 region:rollup2
REASONABLE CONDUCT.

02:03:44.817 --> 02:03:48.721 region:rollup2
WHICH IS THE NORMAL WAY THAT

02:03:46.719 --> 02:03:50.056 region:rollup2
BUSINESSES AND AND OTHER ACTORS

02:03:48.721 --> 02:03:51.691 region:rollup2
IN CALIFORNIA THAT'S THE

02:03:50.056 --> 02:03:53.226 region:rollup2
STANDARD THAT WE ALL FOLLOW WE

02:03:51.691 --> 02:03:54.427 region:rollup2
WE HAVE TO AVOID ACTING IN A

02:03:53.226 --> 02:03:57.297 region:rollup2
NEGLIGENT.

02:03:54.427 --> 02:03:58.898 region:rollup2
FASHION WHAT'S UNIQUE HERE IS

02:03:57.297 --> 02:04:01.200 region:rollup2
THAT LIABILITY ATTACHED IS EVEN

02:03:58.898 --> 02:04:03.936 region:rollup2
IF UTILITIES ARE WITHOUT FAULT

02:04:01.200 --> 02:04:05.905 region:rollup2
AND AND THAT'S NOT A STANDARD WE

02:04:03.936 --> 02:04:07.707 region:rollup2
WOULD SUGGEST THAT FITS.

02:04:05.905 --> 02:04:09.842 region:rollup2
THE CURRENT CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE

02:04:07.707 --> 02:04:11.844 region:rollup2
WERE TALKING ABOUT A VERY

02:04:09.842 --> 02:04:12.845 region:rollup2
SERIOUS RISK WITH VERY.

02:04:11.844 --> 02:04:14.881 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT COSTS AND

02:04:12.845 --> 02:04:15.949 region:rollup2
CONSEQUENCES.

02:04:14.881 --> 02:04:17.750 region:rollup2
BUT THERE'S A WHOLE LOT MORE

02:04:15.949 --> 02:04:19.552 region:rollup2
THAT CAME BEFORETHE INVERSE

02:04:17.750 --> 02:04:22.722 region:rollup2
CONDEMNATION AND THERE'S ALREADY

02:04:19.552 --> 02:04:25.558 region:rollup2
BEEN DISCUSSION ABOUT THAT.

02:04:22.722 --> 02:04:27.360 region:rollup2
GOD ARE OR ENTITIES.

02:04:25.558 --> 02:04:31.597 region:rollup2
THE RIGHT TO EMINENT DOMAIN --

02:04:27.360 --> 02:04:33.132 region:rollup2
IT TO HAVE A RATE OF RETURN.

02:04:31.597 --> 02:04:36.803 region:rollup2
IT THERE SO MUCH MORE.

02:04:33.132 --> 02:04:38.871 region:rollup2
SO THIS IS PART OF A PACKAGE AS

02:04:36.803 --> 02:04:40.440 region:rollup2
OPPOSED TO SIMPLY SAYING ALRIGHT

02:04:38.871 --> 02:04:41.574 region:rollup2
YOU ARE STRICTLY LIABLE.

02:04:40.440 --> 02:04:42.809 region:rollup2
MOTHERS A WHOLE LOT MORE THAT

02:04:41.574 --> 02:04:45.511 region:rollup2
CAME BEFORE THEM.

02:04:42.809 --> 02:04:47.080 region:rollup2
AND SO YOU'LL RECEIVER NOT YOU

02:04:45.511 --> 02:04:48.981 region:rollup2
WITH THE UTILITIES WILL RECEIVE

02:04:47.080 --> 02:04:52.485 region:rollup2
ALL OF THE BENEFITS OF BEING A

02:04:48.981 --> 02:04:54.887 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I GOVERNMENT ENTITY.

02:04:52.485 --> 02:04:56.322 region:rollup2
BUT NOT TO THE LIABILITY THAT

02:04:54.887 --> 02:04:58.091 region:rollup2
HAS BEEN IMPOSED UPON THEM BY

02:04:56.322 --> 02:04:59.759 region:rollup2
THE CONSTITUTION SO I DON'T

02:04:58.091 --> 02:05:01.828 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND I I STILL DON'T

02:04:59.759 --> 02:05:03.930 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND HOW WE WOULD BE ABLE

02:05:01.828 --> 02:05:04.897 region:rollup2
TO DO THAT.

02:05:03.930 --> 02:05:07.066 region:rollup2
AND FIND IT WOULD BE

02:05:04.897 --> 02:05:09.402 region:rollup2
CONSTITUTIONAL AND I RECOGNIZE

02:05:07.066 --> 02:05:10.203 region:rollup2
THAT THERE HAS BEEN DISCUSSION

02:05:09.402 --> 02:05:10.803 region:rollup2
THERE HAS BEEN TESTIMONY ABOUT

02:05:10.203 --> 02:05:13.439 region:rollup2
THAT.

02:05:10.803 --> 02:05:15.375 region:rollup2
I STILL DON'T SEE HOW WOULD BE

02:05:13.439 --> 02:05:16.909 region:rollup2
CONSTITUTIONAL SO MAYBE I CAN

02:05:15.375 --> 02:05:19.245 region:rollup2
TRY A LITTLE BIT MORE PASSIVE

02:05:16.909 --> 02:05:20.880 region:rollup2
FIRST OF ALL THIS BILL WOULD NOT

02:05:19.245 --> 02:05:23.349 region:rollup2
MAKE A DISTINCTION.

02:05:20.880 --> 02:05:25.284 region:rollup2
BETWEEN MUNICIPAL UTILITIES AND

02:05:23.349 --> 02:05:26.319 region:rollup2
INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES.

02:05:25.284 --> 02:05:27.754 region:rollup2
SO THAT THAT WE'RE NOT

02:05:26.319 --> 02:05:28.187 region:rollup2
SUGGESTING THAT INVESTOR OWNED

02:05:27.754 --> 02:05:30.323 region:rollup2
UTILITIES BE TREATED

02:05:28.187 --> 02:05:32.191 region:rollup2
DIFFERENTLY.

02:05:30.323 --> 02:05:34.527 region:rollup2
THEN MUNICIPAL UTILITIES WE WE

02:05:32.191 --> 02:05:35.161 region:rollup2
BOTH FACE THIS PROBLEM.

02:05:34.527 --> 02:05:36.462 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL

02:05:35.161 --> 02:05:40.700 region:rollup2
QUESTION [inaudible]

02:05:36.462 --> 02:05:41.734 region:rollup2
AND THE COURTS HAVE SAID THAT

02:05:40.700 --> 02:05:43.770 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATUREHASA VERY

02:05:41.734 --> 02:05:45.905 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT ROLE TO PLAY IN

02:05:43.770 --> 02:05:47.240 region:rollup2
INTERPRETING THE CONSTITUTION

02:05:45.905 --> 02:05:49.242 region:rollup2
THE SUPREME COURT HAS NEVER

02:05:47.240 --> 02:05:51.210 region:rollup2
DECIDED WHAT IS THE STANDARD

02:05:49.242 --> 02:05:52.311 region:rollup2
THAT SHOULD BE APPLIED IN A WILD

02:05:51.210 --> 02:05:53.279 region:rollup2
FIRE CASE FOR INVERSE

02:05:52.311 --> 02:05:55.448 region:rollup2
CONDEMNATION THEY'VE NEVER

02:05:53.279 --> 02:05:57.350 region:rollup2
ADDRESS THAT QUESTION.

02:05:55.448 --> 02:05:59.252 region:rollup2
AND SO THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY

02:05:57.350 --> 02:06:00.653 region:rollup2
FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO EXPRESS

02:05:59.252 --> 02:06:02.889 region:rollup2
ITS VIEW ABOUT WHAT'S AN

02:06:00.653 --> 02:06:05.324 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE WAY TO APPROACH

02:06:02.889 --> 02:06:06.592 region:rollup2
INVERSE CONDEMNATION LIABILITY.

02:06:05.324 --> 02:06:09.228 region:rollup2
AND WE SUGGEST THAT THE

02:06:06.592 --> 02:06:11.330 region:rollup2
REASONABLENESS STANDARD IS.

02:06:09.228 --> 02:06:13.032 region:rollup2
A PERMISSIBLE CHOICE AND A WISE

02:06:11.330 --> 02:06:15.301 region:rollup2
CHOICE GIVEN ALL THE REASONS

02:06:13.032 --> 02:06:18.171 region:rollup2
YOU'VE HEARD TODAY I MIGHT SAY.

02:06:15.301 --> 02:06:19.839 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA AN ALABAMA ARE THE

02:06:18.171 --> 02:06:22.475 region:rollup2
ONLY STATES IN THE UNION THAT

02:06:19.839 --> 02:06:24.110 region:rollup2
HAVE A STRICT LIABILITY STANDARD

02:06:22.475 --> 02:06:26.345 region:rollup2
FOR INVERSE CONDEMNATION AND IN

02:06:24.110 --> 02:06:28.181 region:rollup2
ALABAMA THAT DID NOT COME UP.

02:06:26.345 --> 02:06:29.849 region:rollup2
IN A WILDFIRE CONTEXT EVERY

02:06:28.181 --> 02:06:30.817 region:rollup2
OTHER STATES THE MAJORITY OF THE

02:06:29.849 --> 02:06:32.952 region:rollup2
STATES IMPOSE INVERSE

02:06:30.817 --> 02:06:34.454 region:rollup2
CONDEMNATION ONLY IF THERE'S

02:06:32.952 --> 02:06:36.122 region:rollup2
INTENTIONAL CONDUCT.

02:06:34.454 --> 02:06:38.157 region:rollup2
AND A MINORITY OF STATES IMPOSE

02:06:36.122 --> 02:06:40.626 region:rollup2
IT IF THE GOVERNMENT IS.

02:06:38.157 --> 02:06:42.662 region:rollup2
NEGLIGENT.

02:06:40.626 --> 02:06:43.296 region:rollup2
BUT THERE'S NO OTHER STATE OTHER

02:06:42.662 --> 02:06:44.664 region:rollup2
THAN CAP AND AND THAT THERE ARE

02:06:43.296 --> 02:06:46.766 region:rollup2
STE ACTUALLY SOME DECISIONS FROM

02:06:44.664 --> 02:06:48.468 region:rollup2
OTHER STATES THAT HAVE REJECTED

02:06:46.766 --> 02:06:49.802 region:rollup2
INVERSE CONDEMNATION CLAIMS AND

02:06:48.468 --> 02:06:51.471 region:rollup2
WILDFIRE CASES.

02:06:49.802 --> 02:06:53.106 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA IS THE ONLY STATE

02:06:51.471 --> 02:06:54.140 region:rollup2
THAT I'M AWARE OF THAT HAS

02:06:53.106 --> 02:06:56.175 region:rollup2
PERMITTED THOSE CLAIMS TO GO

02:06:54.140 --> 02:06:56.843 region:rollup2
FORWARD UNDER STRICT LIABILITY

02:06:56.175 --> 02:06:58.845 region:rollup2
STANDARD.

02:06:56.843 --> 02:07:00.746 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S A SITUATION WHERE THE

02:06:58.845 --> 02:07:02.381 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE CAN EXERCISE ITS

02:07:00.746 --> 02:07:04.984 region:rollup2
PREROGATIVE TO STEP IN AND SAY

02:07:02.381 --> 02:07:05.785 region:rollup2
WE FEEL BASED ON ALL THESE

02:07:04.984 --> 02:07:06.619 region:rollup2
POLICY CONSIDERATIONS YOU'VE

02:07:05.785 --> 02:07:08.154 region:rollup2
HEARD.

02:07:06.619 --> 02:07:09.355 region:rollup2
THAT A REASONABLENESS STANDARD

02:07:08.154 --> 02:07:10.423 region:rollup2
IS MORE APPROPRIATE.

02:07:09.355 --> 02:07:12.458 region:rollup2
AND WE THINK THE COURTS WOULD

02:07:10.423 --> 02:07:13.993 region:rollup2
UPHOLD THAT CHOICE.

02:07:12.458 --> 02:07:15.294 region:rollup2
AT THE MISTER NOT JUST BROKE

02:07:13.993 --> 02:07:16.095 region:rollup2
JUST TO CLARIFY COMMENCEMENT

02:07:15.294 --> 02:07:19.932 region:rollup2
CLARIFYING THAT [inaudible]

02:07:16.095 --> 02:07:21.767 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT DIDN'T ON THAT ANSWER

02:07:19.932 --> 02:07:23.169 region:rollup2
RIGHT THERE LOOK AT REAL BRIEFLY

TAKE TWO SECONDS.

02:07:23.169 --> 02:07:26.506 region:rollup2
SO ARE YOU SAYINGTHAT BECAUSE

02:07:25.404 --> 02:07:26.739 region:rollup2
I'VE NEVER HEARD YOU TAKE TWO

02:07:26.506 --> 02:07:27.140 region:rollup2
SECONDS.

02:07:26.739 --> 02:07:31.043 region:rollup2
SECOND [inaudible]

I DO WE HAVE THE I GUESS THE

02:07:33.112 --> 02:07:37.984 region:rollup2
QUESTION IF I MAY FINISH MY

QUESTION SIR THANK YOU SENATOR.

02:07:37.984 --> 02:07:41.654 region:rollup2

PETITION TO OVERRULE THE LOWER

COURT DECISION.

SPECIFICALLY ON INVERSE

02:07:47.827 --> 02:07:51.364 region:rollup2
CONDEMNATION --

02:07:49.662 --> 02:07:53.900 region:rollup2
FROM THE BUTTE FIRE LAST NIGHT

02:07:51.364 --> 02:07:55.801 region:rollup2
THAT WAS NOT THE QUESTION.

02:07:53.900 --> 02:07:56.035 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY AND

02:07:55.801 --> 02:07:57.904 region:rollup2
CHARGES.

02:07:56.035 --> 02:07:58.604 region:rollup2
IT WOULD.

02:07:57.904 --> 02:08:00.106 region:rollup2
A GOOD ESL OFFER THREE

02:07:58.604 --> 02:08:04.443 region:rollup2
OBSERVATIONS ON THAT.

02:08:00.106 --> 02:08:05.912 region:rollup2
THEY FIRST OF FOR IF I MAY NOT A

02:08:04.443 --> 02:08:08.347 region:rollup2
FIRST JUST TO CLARIFY THE

02:08:05.912 --> 02:08:10.216 region:rollup2
SUPREME COURT'S ACTION WAS NOT A

02:08:08.347 --> 02:08:11.150 region:rollup2
DECISION ON THE MERITS OF THE

02:08:10.216 --> 02:08:12.318 region:rollup2
CASE.

02:08:11.150 --> 02:08:14.186 region:rollup2
THEY SIMPLY EXERCISE THEIR

02:08:12.318 --> 02:08:16.322 region:rollup2
PREROGATIVE NOT TO REVIEW THE

02:08:14.186 --> 02:08:18.858 region:rollup2
CASE SECOND THE ISSUE THAT WAS

02:08:16.322 --> 02:08:20.393 region:rollup2
PRESENTED IN THAT CASE WAS NOT

02:08:18.858 --> 02:08:21.928 region:rollup2
WHETHER THE REASONABLENESS

02:08:20.393 --> 02:08:23.262 region:rollup2
STANDARD SHOULD BE APPLIED.

02:08:21.928 --> 02:08:24.997 region:rollup2
THE ISSUE IN THAT CASE WAS

02:08:23.262 --> 02:08:26.365 region:rollup2
PITCHING HE ARGUED THAT INVERSE

02:08:24.997 --> 02:08:29.068 region:rollup2
CONDEMNATION SHOULD NOT BE

02:08:26.365 --> 02:08:30.403 region:rollup2
APPLIED TO IT BECAUSE IN LIGHT

02:08:29.068 --> 02:08:31.637 region:rollup2
OF THE COMMISSION'S DECISION IN

02:08:30.403 --> 02:08:33.573 region:rollup2
THE SAN DIEGO CASE.

02:08:31.637 --> 02:08:35.174 region:rollup2
IT WASN'T A SHIRT OF THE ABILITY

02:08:33.573 --> 02:08:36.375 region:rollup2
TO PASS THROUGH THOSE COSTS

02:08:35.174 --> 02:08:39.212 region:rollup2
RIGHT THANK YOU --

02:08:36.375 --> 02:08:41.380 region:rollup2
CENTER CANNELLA [inaudible]

02:08:39.212 --> 02:08:42.682 region:rollup2
OKAY.

02:08:41.380 --> 02:08:45.184 region:rollup2
YES VERY SIMPLY THAT IF THE

02:08:42.682 --> 02:08:49.822 region:rollup2
OTHER STATES [inaudible]

02:08:45.184 --> 02:08:52.225 region:rollup2
CAN -- DO

02:08:49.822 --> 02:08:52.692 region:rollup2
WHAT THEY'RE DOING AND BETWEEN

02:08:52.225 --> 02:08:53.426 region:rollup2
ALABAMA CALIFORNIA TWO

02:08:52.692 --> 02:08:55.761 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT.

02:08:53.426 --> 02:08:57.630 region:rollup2
ARE IDENTICAL BECAUSE THEY HAVE

02:08:55.761 --> 02:08:58.464 region:rollup2
A LAW THAT LIMITS STRICT

02:08:57.630 --> 02:08:59.765 region:rollup2
LIABILITY.

02:08:58.464 --> 02:09:01.100 region:rollup2
AND IT'S BEEN UPHELD

02:08:59.765 --> 02:09:02.568 region:rollup2
CONSTITUTIONALLY DOES THAT MEAN

02:09:01.100 --> 02:09:04.437 region:rollup2
THAT WE CAN DO THE SAME THING AS

02:09:02.568 --> 02:09:06.505 region:rollup2
THE OTHER STATES YES.

02:09:04.437 --> 02:09:07.573 region:rollup2
YES IN FACT THERE'S A CASE.

02:09:06.505 --> 02:09:10.543 region:rollup2
JUST BRIEFLY THERE'S A

02:09:07.573 --> 02:09:12.578 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA CASE THAT SAYS WHERE

02:09:10.543 --> 02:09:14.313 region:rollup2
THERE'S COURTS THAT HAVE DECIDED

02:09:12.578 --> 02:09:15.314 region:rollup2
THE ISSUE IN DIFFERENT WAYS THE

02:09:14.313 --> 02:09:17.183 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE CAN PICK ONE OF

02:09:15.314 --> 02:09:18.818 region:rollup2
THOSE WAYS.

02:09:17.183 --> 02:09:19.318 region:rollup2
AND THAT WILL BE UPHELD AS BEING

02:09:18.818 --> 02:09:19.986 region:rollup2
WITHIN THE LEGISLATURE'S

02:09:19.318 --> 02:09:21.487 region:rollup2
AUTHORITY [inaudible]

02:09:19.986 --> 02:09:23.422 region:rollup2
THANK YOU [inaudible]

02:09:21.487 --> 02:09:25.391 region:rollup2
SENATE CANNELLA.

02:09:23.422 --> 02:09:26.158 region:rollup2
THEY'VE SHERMAN SO JUST BRIEFLY

02:09:25.391 --> 02:09:27.493 region:rollup2
AT THE END OF THIS IN VERSE CHO

02:09:26.158 --> 02:09:28.594 region:rollup2
NATION I I FEEL LIKE THIS SHOULD

02:09:27.493 --> 02:09:30.363 region:rollup2
BE THE LAST THING WE'RE TALKING

02:09:28.594 --> 02:09:31.497 region:rollup2
ABOUT AND IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S

02:09:30.363 --> 02:09:33.299 region:rollup2
JUST IS TAKEN UP ABOVE.

02:09:31.497 --> 02:09:34.266 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW ALL THE SPACE BUT I I

02:09:33.299 --> 02:09:35.501 region:rollup2
THINK THE REASON IT'S IMPORTANT

02:09:34.266 --> 02:09:37.503 region:rollup2
WE TALK ABOUT IT REGARDLESS OF

02:09:35.501 --> 02:09:39.372 region:rollup2
IF WE ACTUALLY DON'T ACT.

02:09:37.503 --> 02:09:40.539 region:rollup2
WE KEEP TALKING ABOUT ES DE

02:09:39.372 --> 02:09:42.375 region:rollup2
JEANNIE AND AND HOW THEY'RE THE

02:09:40.539 --> 02:09:44.010 region:rollup2
THE CO THE POSTER CHILD FOR HOW

02:09:42.375 --> 02:09:46.078 region:rollup2
TO DO THINGS RIGHT.

02:09:44.010 --> 02:09:47.079 region:rollup2
WELL THEY WERE RECENTLY I GUESS

02:09:46.078 --> 02:09:47.947 region:rollup2
WE'RE RIESLING FORM THAT THEY'RE

02:09:47.079 --> 02:09:48.948 region:rollup2
GOING AND WITH LESS THIS IS

02:09:47.947 --> 02:09:50.950 region:rollup2
DEALT WITH THEY'RE GONNA BE

02:09:48.948 --> 02:09:51.550 region:rollup2
DOWNGRADED --

02:09:50.950 --> 02:09:53.252 region:rollup2
THREE THREE STEPS OR WHATEVER

02:09:51.550 --> 02:09:54.387 region:rollup2
YOU CALL IT SO THAT'S GONNA COST

02:09:53.252 --> 02:09:55.054 region:rollup2
AS MUCH I THINK THAT'S THE

02:09:54.387 --> 02:09:56.455 region:rollup2
REASON WE TALK ABOUT AGAIN THAT

02:09:55.054 --> 02:09:57.323 region:rollup2
I'D RATHER BE TALKING ABOUT HOW

02:09:56.455 --> 02:09:59.058 region:rollup2
WE DEAL WITH THESE FIRES AND HOW

02:09:57.323 --> 02:10:01.394 region:rollup2
DO WE FUEL MANAGEMENT ALL THAT

02:09:59.058 --> 02:10:01.594 region:rollup2
BUT I TRUST OUR OUR CO CHAIRS

02:10:01.394 --> 02:10:02.795 region:rollup2
THAT.

02:10:01.594 --> 02:10:03.763 region:rollup2
WE WILL GET TO THAT.

02:10:02.795 --> 02:10:05.298 region:rollup2
BUT DO A QUESTION SO THE

02:10:03.763 --> 02:10:06.966 region:rollup2
CONSUMER ATTORNEY WAS VERY STE

02:10:05.298 --> 02:10:08.701 region:rollup2
MISTRIAL YOU BASICALLY SAID THE

02:10:06.966 --> 02:10:10.202 region:rollup2
GUY FROM IF YOU SEE MISLED US

02:10:08.701 --> 02:10:12.338 region:rollup2
WHEN HE WAY TESTIFIED.

02:10:10.202 --> 02:10:13.973 region:rollup2
SO CAN YOU TALK ABOUTTHE THIS

02:10:12.338 --> 02:10:14.874 region:rollup2
INVERSE CORRELATION INTO MY

02:10:13.973 --> 02:10:16.008 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING WAS IN AND AGAIN

02:10:14.874 --> 02:10:17.910 region:rollup2
ABOT ATTORNEY.

02:10:16.008 --> 02:10:20.279 region:rollup2
THAT IF P. GINNY OR ARE YOU TO

02:10:17.910 --> 02:10:21.847 region:rollup2
LOOK UP IS 1% RESPONSIBLE --

02:10:20.279 --> 02:10:23.482 region:rollup2
AND THEY HAVE TO PAY A HUNDRED

02:10:21.847 --> 02:10:24.784 region:rollup2
SO THE COST IS THAT ACTORS THAT

02:10:23.482 --> 02:10:26.952 region:rollup2
NOT ACCURATE THE LEGAL STANDARD

02:10:24.784 --> 02:10:27.420 region:rollup2
IS TO HAVE TO BE A SUBSTANTIAL

02:10:26.952 --> 02:10:28.888 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WHAT'S WHAT'S

02:10:27.420 --> 02:10:30.222 region:rollup2
SUBSTANTIAL.

02:10:28.888 --> 02:10:30.956 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S A CASE BY CASE

02:10:30.222 --> 02:10:33.959 region:rollup2
DETERMINATION ROUGHLY I MEAN

02:10:30.956 --> 02:10:35.895 region:rollup2
APPROXIMATELY --

02:10:33.959 --> 02:10:37.997 region:rollup2
I WOULD SAY IT'S LESS THAN 50%

02:10:35.895 --> 02:10:39.532 region:rollup2
LESS OKAY SO SOFA TRUCK HIT A

02:10:37.997 --> 02:10:40.499 region:rollup2
POLE AND AND SORT OF FIRE THEY

02:10:39.532 --> 02:10:41.701 region:rollup2
WOULD NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR

02:10:40.499 --> 02:10:43.202 region:rollup2
THEM I DON'T KNOW ABOUT A TRUCK

02:10:41.701 --> 02:10:44.937 region:rollup2
AT A POLL BUT I GIVE YOU I'LL

02:10:43.202 --> 02:10:48.040 region:rollup2
GIVE YOU ANOTHER CASE --

02:10:44.937 --> 02:10:51.243 region:rollup2
WITCHES LET'S.

02:10:48.040 --> 02:10:53.012 region:rollup2
I'M CERTAINLY SPEAK OVER YOU --

02:10:51.243 --> 02:10:54.513 region:rollup2
THIS IS THE SITUATION MISTER

02:10:53.012 --> 02:10:56.349 region:rollup2
ARCHER BROUGHT UP WHERE THERE IS

02:10:54.513 --> 02:10:57.216 region:rollup2
A TREE BRANCH THAT'S NOT WITHIN

02:10:56.349 --> 02:10:58.484 region:rollup2
THE RIGHT AWAY NOT WITHIN THE

02:10:57.216 --> 02:10:59.552 region:rollup2
CURRENT SOUND THAT FLOWS INTO

02:10:58.484 --> 02:11:01.721 region:rollup2
THE LINE.

02:10:59.552 --> 02:11:03.089 region:rollup2
AND THE FIRE STARTS AND IT

02:11:01.721 --> 02:11:04.990 region:rollup2
SPREADS TO A LARGE AREA.

02:11:03.089 --> 02:11:06.559 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD BE A SITUATION WHERE

02:11:04.990 --> 02:11:07.593 region:rollup2
INVERSE CONDEMNATION WOULD BE

02:11:06.559 --> 02:11:08.594 region:rollup2
APPLIED EVEN THOUGH THE UTILITY

02:11:07.593 --> 02:11:12.064 region:rollup2

THE CRATER BOMB AGENCIES SMP.

02:11:31.317 --> 02:11:35.821 region:rollup2
COMBAT HAS HE WAS AS A DOUBLE A

02:11:33.552 --> 02:11:37.356 region:rollup2
ZACH WE PERCEIVE SEVERAL A GREAT

02:11:35.821 --> 02:11:39.792 region:rollup2

YES.

02:11:41.927 --> 02:11:44.296 region:rollup2
WHICH IS INTERESTING TO ME

02:11:43.195 --> 02:11:45.998 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE HEARD FROM THE

02:11:44.296 --> 02:11:49.735 region:rollup2
GENTLEMAN IN THE LAST PANEL.

02:11:45.998 --> 02:11:51.070 region:rollup2
pARE -- AND

02:11:49.735 --> 02:11:52.405 region:rollup2
THE ARROW USE HAVE THE EXACT

02:11:51.070 --> 02:11:54.607 region:rollup2
SAME LIABILITY.

02:11:52.405 --> 02:11:57.042 region:rollup2
A FOR INVERSE SO WHY IS IT THAT

02:11:54.607 --> 02:11:58.377 region:rollup2
THE P. YOU USE CREDIT RATINGS

02:11:57.042 --> 02:12:01.280 region:rollup2
ARE GOING UP.

02:11:58.377 --> 02:12:02.882 region:rollup2
AND THE I USE ARE GOING DOWN DO

02:12:01.280 --> 02:12:04.450 region:rollup2
YOU THINK TO GIVE ANY OPINION

02:12:02.882 --> 02:12:07.219 region:rollup2
ABOUT THAT YOU KNOW --

02:12:04.450 --> 02:12:09.355 region:rollup2
WE HAVE HAD A CORE.

02:12:07.219 --> 02:12:11.891 region:rollup2
FROM PA CAR RATING AGENCIES

02:12:09.355 --> 02:12:13.426 region:rollup2
AROUND OUR WILD FIRE RISK THOSE

02:12:11.891 --> 02:12:14.860 region:rollup2
NON QUESTIONS HAVE FOCUSED ON

02:12:13.426 --> 02:12:16.228 region:rollup2
OUR MITIGATION MEASURES AND WHAT

02:12:14.860 --> 02:12:17.496 region:rollup2
WE'RE DOING TO ADDRESS THAT.

02:12:16.228 --> 02:12:19.698 region:rollup2
RISK -- WE

02:12:17.496 --> 02:12:21.300 region:rollup2
ALSO HAVE A STRONG HISTORY OF

02:12:19.698 --> 02:12:22.435 region:rollup2
OUR BOARD.

02:12:21.300 --> 02:12:24.570 region:rollup2
OUR ELECTED BOARD BEING VERY

02:12:22.435 --> 02:12:26.839 region:rollup2
WILLING.

02:12:24.570 --> 02:12:30.743 region:rollup2
TO ON TO OUR CUSTOMERS WHEN

02:12:26.839 --> 02:12:32.278 region:rollup2
NECESSARY SO IT ESSENTIALLY --

02:12:30.743 --> 02:12:33.412 region:rollup2
IS AN INDICATION THAT WE WILL

02:12:32.278 --> 02:12:34.680 region:rollup2
CHARGE OUR CUSTOMERS FOR

02:12:33.412 --> 02:12:36.916 region:rollup2
WHATEVER IS NECESSARY SO I THINK

02:12:34.680 --> 02:12:37.516 region:rollup2
THAT HAS BEEN ONE OF THOSE

02:12:36.916 --> 02:12:39.518 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT IS --

02:12:37.516 --> 02:12:41.620 region:rollup2
DRIVEN --

02:12:39.518 --> 02:12:42.588 region:rollup2
THEM TO TO PROVIDER UPGRADES AS

02:12:41.620 --> 02:12:43.923 region:rollup2
WELL AS ALL THE OTHER THINGS

02:12:42.588 --> 02:12:45.357 region:rollup2
WE'RE DOING AND AND THE USE

02:12:43.923 --> 02:12:46.392 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE THAT ABILITY OTHER

02:12:45.357 --> 02:12:48.060 region:rollup2
THAN IF THE P. YOU SEE GRANTS

02:12:46.392 --> 02:12:50.496 region:rollup2
THEM ABOUT ABILITY TO DO THAT

02:12:48.060 --> 02:12:52.097 region:rollup2
THAT IS MY AND WHAT WOULD HAPPEN

02:12:50.496 --> 02:12:53.666 region:rollup2
AND THEN I ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT.

02:12:52.097 --> 02:12:54.500 region:rollup2
LA DWP WHICH I THINK IS THE

02:12:53.666 --> 02:12:56.101 region:rollup2
LARGEST --

02:12:54.500 --> 02:12:57.703 region:rollup2
THAT IN IN THE STATE THAT

02:12:56.101 --> 02:12:59.205 region:rollup2
THEY'RE ALSO ON THEIR CREDIT

02:12:57.703 --> 02:13:00.840 region:rollup2
RATING IS ALSO VERY GOOD THINK

02:12:59.205 --> 02:13:02.007 region:rollup2
IT DOUBLE A WITH WITH SMP

02:13:00.840 --> 02:13:03.843 region:rollup2
HIGHEST SO WITH WITH MOODY'S IF

02:13:02.007 --> 02:13:05.511 region:rollup2
I UNDERSTAND THAT.

02:13:03.843 --> 02:13:07.213 region:rollup2
A QUICKLY --

02:13:05.511 --> 02:13:10.349 region:rollup2
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF WITHIN

02:13:07.213 --> 02:13:13.786 region:rollup2
SMUTS SERVICE TERRY TERRITORY IF

02:13:10.349 --> 02:13:14.987 region:rollup2

FOR SIXTEEN BILLION DOLLARS

02:13:14.987 --> 02:13:18.057 region:rollup2
NUMBER BECAUSE OF UNDER STRICT

SELL -- WE

02:13:19.024 --> 02:13:22.828 region:rollup2
WOULD OBVIOUSLY PASS THOSE COSTS

02:13:20.726 --> 02:13:24.797 region:rollup2
ON TO WORK CUSTOMER SO WITH A

02:13:22.828 --> 02:13:26.098 region:rollup2
WITH THE MASSIVE INCREASES IN

02:13:24.797 --> 02:13:27.132 region:rollup2
THE BILLS THEY PAY ALL OF OUR

02:13:26.098 --> 02:13:28.634 region:rollup2
CUSTOMERS INCLUDING OUR LOW

02:13:27.132 --> 02:13:29.969 region:rollup2
INCOME CUSTOMERS.

02:13:28.634 --> 02:13:31.337 region:rollup2
WHAT WE WOULD DO THOUGH IS IN

02:13:29.969 --> 02:13:32.571 region:rollup2
ORDER TO MINIMIZE THAT QUITE

02:13:31.337 --> 02:13:33.272 region:rollup2
FRANKLY WE WOULD LOOK AT HOW DO

02:13:32.571 --> 02:13:35.241 region:rollup2
WE MINIMIZE ALL OF OUR OTHER

02:13:33.272 --> 02:13:37.776 region:rollup2
EXPENSES?

02:13:35.241 --> 02:13:40.145 region:rollup2
SO THAT COULD MEAN THAT WHILE WE

02:13:37.776 --> 02:13:41.981 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN FAR MORE AGGRESSIVE IN

02:13:40.145 --> 02:13:44.183 region:rollup2
THE STATE THAN THAN IS REQUIRED

02:13:41.981 --> 02:13:45.751 region:rollup2
BY THE STATE AND PROCURING

02:13:44.183 --> 02:13:47.553 region:rollup2
RENEWABLES INVESTING ELECTRIC.

02:13:45.751 --> 02:13:49.555 region:rollup2
RITESH AND IN ALL LIKELIHOOD

02:13:47.553 --> 02:13:52.658 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD CAUSE US TO PULL BACK

02:13:49.555 --> 02:13:54.727 region:rollup2
THOSE INVESTMENTS TO MINIMIZE.

02:13:52.658 --> 02:13:56.061 region:rollup2
THE RATE IMPACTS TO THE TO THE

02:13:54.727 --> 02:13:58.530 region:rollup2
EXTENT WE WOULD SO WOULD

02:13:56.061 --> 02:13:59.064 region:rollup2
RESHUFFLE HOW WE SPEND MONEY WE

02:13:58.530 --> 02:14:02.167 region:rollup2
WOULD CONTINUE TO MEET THE

02:13:59.064 --> 02:14:02.468 region:rollup2
MINIMUM STANDARDS REQUIRED BY

02:14:02.167 --> 02:14:02.968 region:rollup2
THE STATE.

02:14:02.468 --> 02:14:04.937 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THAT'S OUR LEGAL

02:14:02.968 --> 02:14:05.504 region:rollup2
OBLIGAION BUT WE HAVE A LONG

02:14:04.937 --> 02:14:06.906 region:rollup2
HISTORY OF GOING FAR BEYOND

02:14:05.504 --> 02:14:08.040 region:rollup2
THAT.

02:14:06.906 --> 02:14:10.175 region:rollup2
IN REALITY THAT WOULD PROBABLY

02:14:08.040 --> 02:14:12.077 region:rollup2
CAUSE US --

02:14:10.175 --> 02:14:12.578 region:rollup2
TO TO RE BALLOTS BASED ON THE

02:14:12.077 --> 02:14:13.979 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL IMPACTS TO OUR

02:14:12.578 --> 02:14:15.281 region:rollup2
CUSTOMER.

02:14:13.979 --> 02:14:18.150 region:rollup2
DID YOU DID YOU CAN ASSIMILATE

02:14:15.281 --> 02:14:20.686 region:rollup2
SIXTEEN BILLION DOLLARS --

02:14:18.150 --> 02:14:23.722 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD BE JUST A MASSIVE

02:14:20.686 --> 02:14:25.324 region:rollup2
MASSIVE RATE INCREASE --

02:14:23.722 --> 02:14:26.859 region:rollup2
I WISH Y. CFO'S HERE SHE COULD

02:14:25.324 --> 02:14:28.227 region:rollup2
DO IT IN HER HEAD --

02:14:26.859 --> 02:14:29.094 region:rollup2
BY -- IT

02:14:28.227 --> 02:14:30.796 region:rollup2
WOULD BE.

02:14:29.094 --> 02:14:33.565 region:rollup2
PROBABLY A 40% RATE INCREASE FOR

02:14:30.796 --> 02:14:34.800 region:rollup2
US SO IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE

02:14:33.565 --> 02:14:36.569 region:rollup2
AVERAGE BUSINESS FOR THE AVERAGE

02:14:34.800 --> 02:14:39.772 region:rollup2
BUILT 40% MORE AT A MINIMUM.

02:14:36.569 --> 02:14:41.040 region:rollup2
CAN THANK YOU.

02:14:39.772 --> 02:14:42.741 region:rollup2
OKAY -- THE

02:14:41.040 --> 02:14:46.111 region:rollup2
LAST -- ONE

02:14:42.741 --> 02:14:46.478 region:rollup2
HERE ON SENATOR JACKSON'S.

02:14:46.111 --> 02:14:49.114 region:rollup2
YES THANK YOU --

02:14:46.478 --> 02:14:51.283 region:rollup2
AT APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY

02:14:49.114 --> 02:14:53.719 region:rollup2
AYE SO I CAN PUT ON THE RECORD

02:14:51.283 --> 02:14:55.621 region:rollup2
MY A CONSTERNATION OVER YOUR

02:14:53.719 --> 02:14:57.256 region:rollup2
OBSERVATION AT THE BEGINNING OF

02:14:55.621 --> 02:14:58.524 region:rollup2
THIS DISCUSSION MISTER WISEMAN.

02:14:57.256 --> 02:15:00.192 region:rollup2
THAT THIS WOULD APPLY ONLY

02:14:58.524 --> 02:15:02.094 region:rollup2
STARTING N JANUARY FIRST OF

02:15:00.192 --> 02:15:03.896 region:rollup2
THIS YEAR WHICH MEANS OF THE

02:15:02.094 --> 02:15:05.397 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY I REPRESENT.

02:15:03.896 --> 02:15:07.1000 region:rollup2
WHICH HAD NOW THE SECOND LARGEST

02:15:05.397 --> 02:15:09.568 region:rollup2
WILDFIRE WHICH COST OVER A

02:15:07.1000 --> 02:15:11.503 region:rollup2
THOUSAND HOMES IN TWENTY THREE

02:15:09.568 --> 02:15:12.471 region:rollup2
LIVES BUT WOULD NOT BE INCLUDED

02:15:11.503 --> 02:15:14.506 region:rollup2
IN THAT WE SHOULD BE OKAY WITH

02:15:12.471 --> 02:15:16.275 region:rollup2
THAT -- I AM

02:15:14.506 --> 02:15:17.810 region:rollup2
NOT OKAY WITH THAT AND I DON'T

02:15:16.275 --> 02:15:18.944 region:rollup2
THINK THAT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE

02:15:17.810 --> 02:15:20.913 region:rollup2
NOW SUFFERING.

02:15:18.944 --> 02:15:23.615 region:rollup2
A THROUGH THESE FIRES TO THE CAR

02:15:20.913 --> 02:15:24.450 region:rollup2
FIRED ALL IF THE IT IF THE

02:15:23.615 --> 02:15:26.685 region:rollup2
UTILITIES WERE LIE --

02:15:24.450 --> 02:15:28.554 region:rollup2
HAD --

02:15:26.685 --> 02:15:30.255 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBILITY THAT THEY WOULD

02:15:28.554 --> 02:15:31.390 region:rollup2
BE EXEMPTED FROM WHAT WE KNOW

02:15:30.255 --> 02:15:32.458 region:rollup2
AND COURSE THAT THOSE FIRES WERE

02:15:31.390 --> 02:15:34.627 region:rollup2
NOT.

02:15:32.458 --> 02:15:36.362 region:rollup2
BECAUSE BY THE UTILITY COMPANIES

02:15:34.627 --> 02:15:38.097 region:rollup2
AND ISN'T IT A FACT THAT INVERSE

02:15:36.362 --> 02:15:40.632 region:rollup2
ONLY APPLIES WHEN THE UTILITIES

02:15:38.097 --> 02:15:44.103 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF FIRE.

02:15:40.632 --> 02:15:47.039 region:rollup2
IS THAT CORRECT YES ARE SO.

02:15:44.103 --> 02:15:49.141 region:rollup2
WE HAVE A SITUATION WHERE --

02:15:47.039 --> 02:15:51.176 region:rollup2
IT SEEMS YOU'VE OT TO IN ORDER

02:15:49.141 --> 02:15:54.079 region:rollup2
TO JUSTIFY ES NOW MOVING FROM

02:15:51.176 --> 02:15:56.749 region:rollup2
STRICT LIABILITY --

02:15:54.079 --> 02:15:57.349 region:rollup2
WITH ELECTRICAL TO THE THE WAY

02:15:56.749 --> 02:15:59.118 region:rollup2
WE DO --

02:15:57.349 --> 02:16:01.453 region:rollup2
FLOOD POLICIES IS TO TRY TO

02:15:59.118 --> 02:16:03.022 region:rollup2
EQUATE THE TWO THAT WILL JUSTIFY

02:16:01.453 --> 02:16:04.089 region:rollup2
POTENTIALLY AT LEAST IN YOUR

02:16:03.022 --> 02:16:05.724 region:rollup2
EYES MOVING FROM A STRICT

02:16:04.089 --> 02:16:07.559 region:rollup2
LIABILITY STANDARD TO A

02:16:05.724 --> 02:16:08.093 region:rollup2
REASONABLE STANDARD IS THAT

02:16:07.559 --> 02:16:09.395 region:rollup2
CORRECT THAT'S HOW YOU GET

02:16:08.093 --> 02:16:12.031 region:rollup2
THERE.

02:16:09.395 --> 02:16:14.266 region:rollup2
I WOULD TRY TO CLARIFY --

02:16:12.031 --> 02:16:16.235 region:rollup2
THAT THERE'S TWO QUESTIONS. ONE

02:16:14.266 --> 02:16:19.805 region:rollup2
QUESTION IS DOES THE LEGISLATURE

02:16:16.235 --> 02:16:21.673 region:rollup2
HAVE AUTHORITY. TO ADOPT A

02:16:19.805 --> 02:16:22.474 region:rollup2
REASONABLENESS STANDARD AND THAT

02:16:21.673 --> 02:16:24.443 region:rollup2
QUESTION.

02:16:22.474 --> 02:16:26.278 region:rollup2
FROM A LEGAL PERSPECTIVE DEPENDS

02:16:24.443 --> 02:16:28.180 region:rollup2
ON WHETHER THE CONSTITUTIONAL

02:16:26.278 --> 02:16:30.082 region:rollup2
LANGUAGE COULD BE INTERPRETED IN

02:16:28.180 --> 02:16:31.417 region:rollup2
MORE THAN ONE WAY.

02:16:30.082 --> 02:16:33.552 region:rollup2
THE FACT THAT THE FLOOD CONTROL

02:16:31.417 --> 02:16:35.821 region:rollup2
CASES DID IT THAT WAY SHOWS THAT

02:16:33.552 --> 02:16:37.790 region:rollup2
THAT'S A POSSIBLE INTERPRETATION

02:16:35.821 --> 02:16:39.658 region:rollup2
THE SECOND QUESTION IS.

02:16:37.790 --> 02:16:41.427 region:rollup2
SHOULD THE LEGISLATURE ADOPT A

02:16:39.658 --> 02:16:43.062 region:rollup2
REASONABLENESS STANDARD.

02:16:41.427 --> 02:16:44.797 region:rollup2
AND WE WOULD SUBMIT THAT'S

02:16:43.062 --> 02:16:45.698 region:rollup2
PARTLY INFLUENCED BY THE

02:16:44.797 --> 02:16:47.266 region:rollup2
CONSIDERATIONS IN THE FLOOD

02:16:45.698 --> 02:16:48.767 region:rollup2
CONTROL CONTEXT.

02:16:47.266 --> 02:16:49.702 region:rollup2
BUT ALSO PARTLY INFLUENCED BY

02:16:48.767 --> 02:16:51.070 region:rollup2
ALL THE OTHER THINGS THAT YOU

02:16:49.702 --> 02:16:52.604 region:rollup2
HEARD TODAY IN TERMS OF THE

02:16:51.070 --> 02:16:53.639 region:rollup2
NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES FOR THE

02:16:52.604 --> 02:16:55.607 region:rollup2
STATE.

02:16:53.639 --> 02:16:57.643 region:rollup2
OF A STRICT LIABILITY STANDARD.

02:16:55.607 --> 02:16:59.978 region:rollup2
BUT AS WAS POINTED OUT BY MY

02:16:57.643 --> 02:17:01.713 region:rollup2
COLLEAGUE ASSEMBLYWOMAN --

02:16:59.978 --> 02:17:03.649 region:rollup2
FROM [inaudible]

02:17:01.713 --> 02:17:05.084 region:rollup2
RIVERSIDE COUNTY.

02:17:03.649 --> 02:17:06.852 region:rollup2
SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY.

02:17:05.084 --> 02:17:08.787 region:rollup2
WE NOW HAVE A STRICT LIABILITY

02:17:06.852 --> 02:17:10.122 region:rollup2
STANDARD AND COMPANIES LIKE P.

02:17:08.787 --> 02:17:12.091 region:rollup2
CHENEY WHICH ARE NOT HERE TODAY

02:17:10.122 --> 02:17:13.859 region:rollup2
FOR WHATEVER REASON --

02:17:12.091 --> 02:17:15.594 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN FOUND LIABLE EVEN

02:17:13.859 --> 02:17:17.830 region:rollup2
UNDER NEGLIGENCE THERE THAT THEY

02:17:15.594 --> 02:17:19.331 region:rollup2
HAVEN'T EVEN DONE THAT LEVEL SO

02:17:17.830 --> 02:17:20.933 region:rollup2
WHY SHOULD WE REDUCE THEIR

02:17:19.331 --> 02:17:22.267 region:rollup2
LIABILITY --

02:17:20.933 --> 02:17:23.936 region:rollup2
AND EXPECT THAT THEY'RE GOING TO

02:17:22.267 --> 02:17:26.205 region:rollup2
DO MORE.

02:17:23.936 --> 02:17:27.940 region:rollup2
WITH LESS LIABILITY BUT I DON'T

02:17:26.205 --> 02:17:29.908 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND THE LOGIC BEHIND THAT

02:17:27.940 --> 02:17:30.476 region:rollup2
COULD YOU EXPLAIN THAT.

02:17:29.908 --> 02:17:31.009 region:rollup2
I'D LIKE TO TAKE A CRACK AT

02:17:30.476 --> 02:17:33.011 region:rollup2
THAT'S ASSURE [inaudible]

02:17:31.009 --> 02:17:34.279 region:rollup2
I THINK.

02:17:33.011 --> 02:17:36.148 region:rollup2
WHAT YOU JUST POINTED OUT IS

02:17:34.279 --> 02:17:39.384 region:rollup2
THAT THE STRICT LIABILITY

02:17:36.148 --> 02:17:42.788 region:rollup2
STANDARD HE IS NOT EFFECTIVE?

02:17:39.384 --> 02:17:44.756 region:rollup2
IN A CHANGING UTILITY BEHAVIOR

02:17:42.788 --> 02:17:46.325 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S WHY WE HAVE IN THE

02:17:44.756 --> 02:17:48.427 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL HAS OTHER

02:17:46.325 --> 02:17:50.195 region:rollup2
THINGS PROPOSED. TO HAVE MUCH

02:17:48.427 --> 02:17:51.730 region:rollup2
BETTER WELFARE MITIGATION PLANS

02:17:50.195 --> 02:17:53.298 region:rollup2
TO HAVE INCREASED PENALTIES TO

02:17:51.730 --> 02:17:55.067 region:rollup2
HAVE ANNUAL REVIEWS WITH FINES

02:17:53.298 --> 02:17:56.602 region:rollup2
THINGS IT WILL DO A DIRECTLY TO

02:17:55.067 --> 02:17:59.204 region:rollup2
SHAREHOLDER PROFITS.

02:17:56.602 --> 02:18:01.306 region:rollup2
THAT'S THE KIND OF THING WHICH

02:17:59.204 --> 02:18:02.574 region:rollup2
I'M WILL BE EFFECTIVE INVERSE

02:18:01.306 --> 02:18:04.443 region:rollup2
CONDEMNATION UNTIL THE US TO

02:18:02.574 --> 02:18:05.611 region:rollup2
JEANNIE CASE AT ALL WE CAN PASS

02:18:04.443 --> 02:18:06.879 region:rollup2
THROUGH TO THE RATE PAYERS.

02:18:05.611 --> 02:18:09.181 region:rollup2
AND SO IT HASN'T BEEN AN

02:18:06.879 --> 02:18:10.616 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVE TOOL EXCEPT THAT THE

02:18:09.181 --> 02:18:12.518 region:rollup2
FACT THAT IT DID GET PASS

02:18:10.616 --> 02:18:14.186 region:rollup2
THROUGH TO THE RATE PAYERS WAS

02:18:12.518 --> 02:18:16.021 region:rollup2
PART OF THE INCENTIVE.

02:18:14.186 --> 02:18:19.358 region:rollup2
THICK WITH THAT ES DE ANY --

02:18:16.021 --> 02:18:21.093 region:rollup2
SAN DIEGO GAS ELECTRIC TO HARDEN

02:18:19.358 --> 02:18:23.295 region:rollup2
THEIR SYSTEM AND MAKE IT THE

02:18:21.093 --> 02:18:25.164 region:rollup2
GOLD STANDARD ISN'T THAT RIGHT

02:18:23.295 --> 02:18:27.432 region:rollup2
NO ACTUALLY.

02:18:25.164 --> 02:18:29.168 region:rollup2
THE AT SEG ANY EXPECTED LIKE IT

02:18:27.432 --> 02:18:30.202 region:rollup2
AND ALL CASES IN THE PAST THAT

02:18:29.168 --> 02:18:30.869 region:rollup2
IT WOULD BE PASSED THE RATE

02:18:30.202 --> 02:18:31.436 region:rollup2
PAYERS.

02:18:30.869 --> 02:18:32.971 region:rollup2
AND WOOD NOT BECAUSE

02:18:31.436 --> 02:18:34.173 region:rollup2
SHAREHOLDERS ANYTHING AND NEVER

02:18:32.971 --> 02:18:35.874 region:rollup2
THE LESS THEY SPIT AND PARKED IN

02:18:34.173 --> 02:18:37.109 region:rollup2
A TEN YEAR PROGRAM TO MAKE THE

02:18:35.874 --> 02:18:37.643 region:rollup2
SYSTEM BETTER.

02:18:37.109 --> 02:18:39.278 region:rollup2
SO.

02:18:37.643 --> 02:18:41.180 region:rollup2
ITEM THIS I DON'T UNDERSTAND

02:18:39.278 --> 02:18:42.714 region:rollup2
YOUR LOGIC HERE FORGIVE ME IT'S

02:18:41.180 --> 02:18:44.449 region:rollup2
LIKE AS I SAID THE OTHER DAY.

02:18:42.714 --> 02:18:46.351 region:rollup2
IT'S IT'S IT'S LIKE THE GUY WHO

02:18:44.449 --> 02:18:48.053 region:rollup2
KILLED HIS PARENTS AND GOES

02:18:46.351 --> 02:18:50.589 region:rollup2
BEFORE THE COURT AND BEG FOR

02:18:48.053 --> 02:18:51.957 region:rollup2
MERCY BECAUSE HE'S AN ORPHAN.

02:18:50.589 --> 02:18:54.226 region:rollup2
I JUST AND DOESN'T AND NO ONE

02:18:51.957 --> 02:18:54.827 region:rollup2
SEEMS TO GET THERE TODAY ANY

02:18:54.226 --> 02:18:55.494 region:rollup2
BETTER THAN THEY DID THE OTHER

02:18:54.827 --> 02:18:58.363 region:rollup2
DAY.

02:18:55.494 --> 02:19:00.566 region:rollup2
BUT BASICALLY YOU'RE ASKING FOR

02:18:58.363 --> 02:19:02.034 region:rollup2
YOU'RE ASKING FOR A LESSER

02:19:00.566 --> 02:19:04.236 region:rollup2
PENALTY.

02:19:02.034 --> 02:19:05.571 region:rollup2
BECAUSE YOU DID WORSE BEHAVIOR

02:19:04.236 --> 02:19:07.239 region:rollup2
SAYING THAT ACTUALLY IF THE

02:19:05.571 --> 02:19:08.307 region:rollup2
OPPOSITE SENATOR WELL I I I

02:19:07.239 --> 02:19:09.641 region:rollup2
WOULD HAVE TO RESPECTFULLY

02:19:08.307 --> 02:19:10.776 region:rollup2
INCREASING PENALTIES THE

02:19:09.641 --> 02:19:12.978 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL HAS

02:19:10.776 --> 02:19:14.513 region:rollup2
INCREASED PENALTIES BILL BUT IT

02:19:12.978 --> 02:19:16.315 region:rollup2
REDUCES LIABILITY.

02:19:14.513 --> 02:19:17.749 region:rollup2
I I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT

02:19:16.315 --> 02:19:19.651 region:rollup2
LET ME LET ME GO ONE THAT.

02:19:17.749 --> 02:19:20.986 region:rollup2
YOU COULD TRY TO ANALOGIZE HAS

02:19:19.651 --> 02:19:22.988 region:rollup2
TO A NORMAL BUSINESS SITUATION

02:19:20.986 --> 02:19:25.123 region:rollup2
BUT PART OF THE REASON THAT WE

02:19:22.988 --> 02:19:26.024 region:rollup2
ASK YOU WOULD THAT WE REQUIRE

02:19:25.123 --> 02:19:26.558 region:rollup2

STANDARDS.

02:19:26.558 --> 02:19:30.362 region:rollup2
IS BECAUSE WE'VE LET YOU BECOME

02:19:28.160 --> 02:19:34.166 region:rollup2
A MONOPOLY AND WE FLETCHER CHIU

GOING TO DO THAT.

02:19:47.913 --> 02:19:50.782 region:rollup2
DON'T LET IT SHOULDN'T WE BE

02:19:48.947 --> 02:19:51.750 region:rollup2
ENTITLED TO EXPECT THAT YOU'RE

02:19:50.782 --> 02:19:54.219 region:rollup2
GOING TO EVERYTHING HUMANLY

02:19:51.750 --> 02:19:55.587 region:rollup2
POSSIBLE TO PROTECT OUR PROPERTY

02:19:54.219 --> 02:19:57.122 region:rollup2
NOW THAT YOU GOT THE RIGHT KEVIN

02:19:55.587 --> 02:19:58.423 region:rollup2
EASTMAN ACROSS AND PUT YOUR

02:19:57.122 --> 02:20:00.592 region:rollup2

OUT YOU KNOW ON MY PROPERTY HERE

02:20:00.592 --> 02:20:03.662 region:rollup2
MANY FENCE LINE OR OTHER

02:20:01.126 --> 02:20:04.863 region:rollup2
PEOPLE'S WHY SHOULD WE SAY TO

02:20:03.662 --> 02:20:07.065 region:rollup2
YOU THAT WASHER WE NOW SAY WELL

02:20:04.863 --> 02:20:07.966 region:rollup2
LET'S LOOK AT YOU LIKE YOU'RE

02:20:07.065 --> 02:20:08.267 region:rollup2
ANY OTHER BUSINESS YOU'RE NOT

02:20:07.966 --> 02:20:10.102 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

02:20:08.267 --> 02:20:11.336 region:rollup2
BAD.

02:20:10.102 --> 02:20:11.637 region:rollup2
HOW DO YOU JUSTIFY THAT

02:20:11.336 --> 02:20:15.974 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

02:20:11.637 --> 02:20:18.844 region:rollup2
SO -- WHAT

02:20:15.974 --> 02:20:20.646 region:rollup2
GOES WITH FEE OUR AUTHORITY TO

02:20:18.844 --> 02:20:21.880 region:rollup2
EXERCISE EMINENT DOMAIN IS THE

02:20:20.646 --> 02:20:24.016 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBILITY TO PROVIDE

02:20:21.880 --> 02:20:26.318 region:rollup2
SERVICE IN ALL PARTS OF THE

02:20:24.016 --> 02:20:27.252 region:rollup2
STATE WHICH IS NOT AN OBLIGATION

02:20:26.318 --> 02:20:28.520 region:rollup2
THAT IS IMPOSED ON A PRIVATE

02:20:27.252 --> 02:20:30.689 region:rollup2
BUSINESS?

02:20:28.520 --> 02:20:32.057 region:rollup2
SO THE QUESTION IS NOT WHETHER

02:20:30.689 --> 02:20:33.925 region:rollup2
THE UTILITIES SHOULD BE

02:20:32.057 --> 02:20:35.560 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBLE THE QUESTION IS NOT

02:20:33.925 --> 02:20:37.329 region:rollup2
WHETHER THE UTILITIES.

02:20:35.560 --> 02:20:38.964 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE LIABLE IN THE EVENT

02:20:37.329 --> 02:20:39.765 region:rollup2
THAT THE ACT AND RECENTLY THE

02:20:38.964 --> 02:20:41.767 region:rollup2
QUESTION IS WHETHER THEY SHOULD

02:20:39.765 --> 02:20:43.468 region:rollup2
BE HELD LIABLE.

02:20:41.767 --> 02:20:44.803 region:rollup2
IF THERE WITHOUT FAULT IN

02:20:43.468 --> 02:20:46.405 region:rollup2
CARRYING OUT THAT PUBLIC SERVICE

02:20:44.803 --> 02:20:47.606 region:rollup2
WILL BUT WE REQUIRE THAT IN A

02:20:46.405 --> 02:20:49.608 region:rollup2
LOT OF DIFFERENT AREAS WITH

02:20:47.606 --> 02:20:51.209 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT AND AND PART OF THE

02:20:49.608 --> 02:20:52.744 region:rollup2
REASON IS IT NOT.

02:20:51.209 --> 02:20:53.912 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WHEN LAWYERS GET

02:20:52.744 --> 02:20:55.147 region:rollup2
TOGETHER AND I WANT TO SOME

02:20:53.912 --> 02:20:56.982 region:rollup2
MOPPING CRITICAL.

02:20:55.147 --> 02:20:59.318 region:rollup2
IS WE'RE GONNA FIGHT OVER THE

02:20:56.982 --> 02:21:00.686 region:rollup2
LIABILITY ISSUE FIRST START WEEK

02:20:59.318 --> 02:21:02.487 region:rollup2
THAT'S THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE IF

02:21:00.686 --> 02:21:04.389 region:rollup2
IT IF WE HAVE STRICT LIABILITY

02:21:02.487 --> 02:21:06.224 region:rollup2
IN NO FAULT THAT ISSUE WE SKIP

02:21:04.389 --> 02:21:07.993 region:rollup2
OVER THAT WE GO TO WATER THAT

02:21:06.224 --> 02:21:09.461 region:rollup2
WHAT OF THE COMPENSATION WHAT'S.

02:21:07.993 --> 02:21:12.264 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE DAMAGES.

02:21:09.461 --> 02:21:13.632 region:rollup2
BUT IN THIS CASE AND THAT'S WERE

02:21:12.264 --> 02:21:15.167 region:rollup2
PART OF THE REASO IF I'M NOT

02:21:13.632 --> 02:21:16.969 region:rollup2
MISTAKEN THAT WE'VE HAD DISTRICT

02:21:15.167 --> 02:21:18.804 region:rollup2
LIABILITIES BECAUSE WE WANT TO

02:21:16.969 --> 02:21:20.472 region:rollup2
TRY TO MAKE THE VICTIMS HOLE AS

02:21:18.804 --> 02:21:23.208 region:rollup2
QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.

02:21:20.472 --> 02:21:24.876 region:rollup2
ESOS WITNESSES TESTIFIED EARLIER

02:21:23.208 --> 02:21:26.478 region:rollup2
THEIR HOMES THAT THEY'RE THEY'RE

02:21:24.876 --> 02:21:29.514 region:rollup2
LIVING SOMEWHERE ELSE THEIR

02:21:26.478 --> 02:21:31.483 region:rollup2
LIVES HERE UP IN IN THE AIR THEY

02:21:29.514 --> 02:21:32.751 region:rollup2
WANT TO GET BACK TO TO

02:21:31.483 --> 02:21:34.286 region:rollup2
CREATIVELY DOING THEIR HOMES

02:21:32.751 --> 02:21:35.854 region:rollup2
REBUILDING OR FINDING ANOTHER

02:21:34.286 --> 02:21:36.955 region:rollup2
PLACE TO LIVE A REBUILDING THEIR

02:21:35.854 --> 02:21:38.223 region:rollup2
BUSINESSES.

02:21:36.955 --> 02:21:39.958 region:rollup2
SO WHEN YOU HAVE IF I'M NOT

02:21:38.223 --> 02:21:42.561 region:rollup2
MISTAKEN PART OF THE REASON FOR

02:21:39.958 --> 02:21:44.029 region:rollup2
THIS FOR OUR INVERSE

02:21:42.561 --> 02:21:47.032 region:rollup2
CONDEMNATION --

02:21:44.029 --> 02:21:49.001 region:rollup2
LAWS TODAY IS THAT IT EXPEDITED

02:21:47.032 --> 02:21:50.602 region:rollup2
THE PROCESS BY WHICH THE VICTIMS

02:21:49.001 --> 02:21:52.637 region:rollup2
ARE ABLE TO GET ON WITH THEIR

02:21:50.602 --> 02:21:54.272 region:rollup2
LIVES BUT ISN'T IT TRUE THAT IF

02:21:52.637 --> 02:21:55.440 region:rollup2
WE IF WE'RE NOW TALKING ABOUT

02:21:54.272 --> 02:21:56.608 region:rollup2
REASONABLE LISTEN RETIREMENT

02:21:55.440 --> 02:21:58.310 region:rollup2
NEGLIGENCE.

02:21:56.608 --> 02:21:59.745 region:rollup2
THIS IS GOING TO BE A FOUR FIVE

02:21:58.310 --> 02:22:00.879 region:rollup2
YEAR BATTLE IN A COURT ROOM AND

02:21:59.745 --> 02:22:02.114 region:rollup2
THESE PEOPLE ARE SITTING THERE

02:22:00.879 --> 02:22:03.682 region:rollup2
WITH THE CLOCK TICKING THEY

02:22:02.114 --> 02:22:04.516 region:rollup2
MIGHT GET TWO YEARS WORTH OF

02:22:03.682 --> 02:22:07.853 region:rollup2
COMPA.

02:22:04.516 --> 02:22:09.888 region:rollup2
PAYMENTS FOR A FOR LIVING IN

02:22:07.853 --> 02:22:11.823 region:rollup2
UNDER THEIR INSURANCE POLICIES.

02:22:09.888 --> 02:22:14.893 region:rollup2
IT ISN'T PARA REASON FOR THIS

02:22:11.823 --> 02:22:16.661 region:rollup2
SENATE AND ISN'T THAT REASON --

02:22:14.893 --> 02:22:18.330 region:rollup2
ONE THAT HELPS THE VICTIMS OF

02:22:16.661 --> 02:22:20.032 region:rollup2
THIS KIND OF BEHAVIOR OF THE

02:22:18.330 --> 02:22:22.000 region:rollup2
FACT THAT YOUR THAT YOUR

02:22:20.032 --> 02:22:23.535 region:rollup2
UTILITIES HAVE CAUSED THE FIRE

02:22:22.000 --> 02:22:24.970 region:rollup2
WHETHER THEY'VE BEEN HARDENED OR

02:22:23.535 --> 02:22:26.638 region:rollup2
NOT HARDEN PROPERLY.

02:22:24.970 --> 02:22:29.007 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW WE DON'T HAVE ANY REAL

02:22:26.638 --> 02:22:31.209 region:rollup2
SUBSTANDARD AND THE AND I'VE YET

02:22:29.007 --> 02:22:32.411 region:rollup2

02:22:36.381 --> 02:22:39.751 region:rollup2
THING IS STABILIZING MARKETS MY

02:22:38.050 --> 02:22:40.485 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU'RE

02:22:39.751 --> 02:22:42.587 region:rollup2
GOING TO DO TO PREVENT THESE

02:22:40.485 --> 02:22:44.256 region:rollup2
FIRES HOW WE CAN MAKE THAT PIE

02:22:42.587 --> 02:22:45.857 region:rollup2
SMALLER HOW YOU GOING TO DO THAT

02:22:44.256 --> 02:22:49.161 region:rollup2

1100% AGREE WITH YOU THAT

02:23:00.639 --> 02:23:03.275 region:rollup2
VICTIMS NEED TO BE MADE WHOLE

02:23:02.641 --> 02:23:04.843 region:rollup2
AND THEY NEED TO MEAN MADE WHOLE

02:23:03.275 --> 02:23:06.845 region:rollup2
QUICKLY.

02:23:04.843 --> 02:23:07.779 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHAT INSURANCE IS.

02:23:06.845 --> 02:23:09.247 region:rollup2
FOR INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE

02:23:07.779 --> 02:23:10.982 region:rollup2
SUPPOSED TO DO THAT QUESTION

02:23:09.247 --> 02:23:11.883 region:rollup2
HERE IS WHETHER YOU WANT TO MAKE

OR SHAREHOLDERS OR MAKE THE

02:23:15.554 --> 02:23:18.356 region:rollup2
COMPANIES DO THEIR JOBS AWAY

02:23:16.988 --> 02:23:20.225 region:rollup2
THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO NOT GIVE UP

02:23:18.356 --> 02:23:21.359 region:rollup2
BONUSES AND NOT TALK ABOUT

SECURITY AND NOT TALK ABOUT

FOLLOW THEIR PLANTS THAT'S

02:23:37.375 --> 02:23:41.580 region:rollup2
EXACTLY WHAT THE PROPOSAL DOES.

02:23:40.645 --> 02:23:43.081 region:rollup2
THE MEMBER WOULD.

MAKE YOU I APOLOGIZE FOR THE

02:23:43.081 --> 02:23:45.717 region:rollup2
LITERALLY THE LAST ONE ALRIGHT

02:23:44.249 --> 02:23:47.285 region:rollup2
PARA CLOSED I THINK WE'RE ALL

02:23:45.717 --> 02:23:48.820 region:rollup2
DONE I THINK EVERYBODY'S ASK THE

02:23:47.285 --> 02:23:49.121 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS THAT FOR ME

02:23:48.820 --> 02:23:50.989 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

02:23:49.121 --> 02:23:53.458 region:rollup2
SO REALISTICALLY.

02:23:50.989 --> 02:23:55.460 region:rollup2
HOW LONG WOULD SOME OF THESE

02:23:53.458 --> 02:23:57.362 region:rollup2
PLANS THAT THE GOVERNOR'S

02:23:55.460 --> 02:23:59.698 region:rollup2
CALLING FOR IN HIS --

02:23:57.362 --> 02:24:00.098 region:rollup2
IN HIS A PROPOSAL HERE TAKE. FOR

02:23:59.698 --> 02:24:07.572 region:rollup2
YOU GUYS. TO ENACT

02:24:00.098 --> 02:24:09.341 region:rollup2
REALISTICALLY.

02:24:07.572 --> 02:24:11.076 region:rollup2
UNDER THE TIME LINES.

02:24:09.341 --> 02:24:13.078 region:rollup2
THAT HAVE BEEN PROPOSED.

02:24:11.076 --> 02:24:15.280 region:rollup2
BY NEXT JULY FIRST.

02:24:13.078 --> 02:24:17.048 region:rollup2
THE PROPOSALS WOULD BEGIN.

02:24:15.280 --> 02:24:18.617 region:rollup2
THE COMMISSION WE WOULD HOPE

02:24:17.048 --> 02:24:20.285 region:rollup2
WOULD ACT VERY QUICKLY ON THAT

02:24:18.617 --> 02:24:22.988 region:rollup2
PUSHED THROUGH IT LANGUAGES

02:24:20.285 --> 02:24:25.790 region:rollup2
STRIVE THEY THAT'S RIGHT DR AND

02:24:22.988 --> 02:24:27.158 region:rollup2
WE ARE CERTAINLY AMENABLE TO

02:24:25.790 --> 02:24:27.792 region:rollup2
STRENGTHENING THAT LANGUAGE I

02:24:27.158 --> 02:24:28.660 region:rollup2
THINK THERE'S A GOOD CASE TO BE

02:24:27.792 --> 02:24:29.694 region:rollup2
MADE THAT.

02:24:28.660 --> 02:24:31.463 region:rollup2
THE COMMISSION OUGHT TO BE GIVEN

02:24:29.694 --> 02:24:32.764 region:rollup2
A HARD DEADLINE BECAUSE THE

02:24:31.463 --> 02:24:34.266 region:rollup2
COMMISSION HAS A HISTORY OF

02:24:32.764 --> 02:24:36.434 region:rollup2
TAKING LONGER THAN IT SHOULD.

02:24:34.266 --> 02:24:39.171 region:rollup2
AND IF HE AND THE WISDOM OF THIS

02:24:36.434 --> 02:24:40.405 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE YOU WANNA MODIFY THAT

02:24:39.171 --> 02:24:41.606 region:rollup2
TO PUT IN A HARDER DEADLINE.

02:24:40.405 --> 02:24:43.875 region:rollup2
I THINK YOU FIND A LOT OF

02:24:41.606 --> 02:24:45.143 region:rollup2
RECEPTIVENESS FROM SOME OF US.

02:24:43.875 --> 02:24:46.511 region:rollup2
A QUESTION I THOUGHT AND IF I

02:24:45.143 --> 02:24:48.346 region:rollup2
DIDN'T SAY IT THIS WAY COLLEGE

02:24:46.511 --> 02:24:49.814 region:rollup2
EYES HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE YOU

02:24:48.346 --> 02:24:50.649 region:rollup2
TO ENACT THOSE PLANS WE KNOW

02:24:49.814 --> 02:24:51.583 region:rollup2
THAT AS THE GENIE HAS BEEN

02:24:50.649 --> 02:24:55.387 region:rollup2
WORKING ON THESE.

02:24:51.583 --> 02:24:57.122 region:rollup2
OVER TEN YEARS SO REALISTICALLY

02:24:55.387 --> 02:24:58.657 region:rollup2
SMART BOMBS NOW.

02:24:57.122 --> 02:25:00.425 region:rollup2
HOW LONG YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN

02:24:58.657 --> 02:25:01.726 region:rollup2
DOING WORK OBVIOUSLY --

02:25:00.425 --> 02:25:02.894 region:rollup2
THE MARKET SEEMED TO RECOGNIZE

02:25:01.726 --> 02:25:05.597 region:rollup2
WHAT YOU'RE DOING --

02:25:02.894 --> 02:25:06.331 region:rollup2
HOW LONG?

02:25:05.597 --> 02:25:08.099 region:rollup2
DOES IT TAKE TO PUT THESE PLANS

02:25:06.331 --> 02:25:09.901 region:rollup2
INTO EFFECT WHAT THE PLANS AND

02:25:08.099 --> 02:25:11.536 region:rollup2
THE PLANS HAVE TO EVOLVE OVER

02:25:09.901 --> 02:25:13.305 region:rollup2
TIME AND I CONDITIONS CHANGE

02:25:11.536 --> 02:25:14.606 region:rollup2
THAT'S THE OTHER PART OF IT SO.

02:25:13.305 --> 02:25:16.174 region:rollup2
IT IS -- YOU

02:25:14.606 --> 02:25:18.410 region:rollup2
PLAN AND THEN YOU YOU LAY OUT A

02:25:16.174 --> 02:25:19.711 region:rollup2
TIMELINE SO FOR EXAMPLE WE ARE

02:25:18.410 --> 02:25:21.246 region:rollup2
INCREASING --

02:25:19.711 --> 02:25:22.547 region:rollup2
WE'VE INCREASED OUR VEGETATION

02:25:21.246 --> 02:25:24.983 region:rollup2
MANAGEMENT TO MOVE OUTSIDE OF

02:25:22.547 --> 02:25:27.419 region:rollup2
THEIR RIGHTS OF WAY AND STARTING

02:25:24.983 --> 02:25:29.220 region:rollup2
TO NEGOTIATE WITH --

02:25:27.419 --> 02:25:30.889 region:rollup2
PROPERTY OWNERS TO REMOVE.

02:25:29.220 --> 02:25:32.457 region:rollup2
PALM TREES IN THEIR RIGHTS OF

02:25:30.889 --> 02:25:35.327 region:rollup2
WAY WE ARE --

02:25:32.457 --> 02:25:38.163 region:rollup2
INVESTING MORE IN I'M TECHNOLOGY

02:25:35.327 --> 02:25:39.731 region:rollup2
TO DEATH. TO DETECT A PROBLEM

02:25:38.163 --> 02:25:41.866 region:rollup2
TREES LIKE LET LIGHT ARE.

02:25:39.731 --> 02:25:43.401 region:rollup2
EXTREME --

02:25:41.866 --> 02:25:47.038 region:rollup2
TO DETECT LE ABOUT FAULT LINES

02:25:43.401 --> 02:25:48.039 region:rollup2
IN SAYS.

02:25:47.038 --> 02:25:49.307 region:rollup2
I'M SO IT'S IT'S THERE IT'S A

02:25:48.039 --> 02:25:50.976 region:rollup2
MULTIPLE THINGS THAT YOU HAVE TO

02:25:49.307 --> 02:25:52.744 region:rollup2
DO THERE'S NOT A ONE SIZE FITS

02:25:50.976 --> 02:25:54.079 region:rollup2
ALL IT'S ALSO GOING TO DEPEND ON

02:25:52.744 --> 02:25:55.146 region:rollup2
WHAT IS YOUR SERVICE TERRITORY

02:25:54.079 --> 02:25:56.948 region:rollup2
LOOK LIKE WHAT IS YOUR EMPIRE

02:25:55.146 --> 02:25:58.483 region:rollup2
MET LOOK LIKE --

02:25:56.948 --> 02:26:00.619 region:rollup2
SITE I SUSPECT --

02:25:58.483 --> 02:26:02.254 region:rollup2
THE PLANTS THAT NEED TO BE PUT

02:26:00.619 --> 02:26:03.989 region:rollup2
IN PLACE WILL LOOK DIFFERENT FOR

02:26:02.254 --> 02:26:05.390 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT UTILITIES DEPENDING ON

02:26:03.989 --> 02:26:07.292 region:rollup2
THEIR CIRCUMSTANCES.

02:26:05.390 --> 02:26:08.960 region:rollup2
AND IT PROBABLY WILL TAKE --

02:26:07.292 --> 02:26:10.562 region:rollup2
A FEW YEARS OF INVESTMENT TO

02:26:08.960 --> 02:26:11.863 region:rollup2
MOVE ON BUT I ALSO THINK THIS IS

02:26:10.562 --> 02:26:13.198 region:rollup2
SOMETHING YOU SHOT ONE AND DONE

02:26:11.863 --> 02:26:15.834 region:rollup2
THIS ISA PROGRAM THAT PROBABLY

02:26:13.198 --> 02:26:17.168 region:rollup2
LAST. FOR EVER QUITE FRANKLY

02:26:15.834 --> 02:26:19.104 region:rollup2
THAT UTILITIES ARE GOING TO HAVE

02:26:17.168 --> 02:26:20.505 region:rollup2
TO CONTINUE TO STEP UP THE GAME

02:26:19.104 --> 02:26:22.207 region:rollup2
AS NEW TECHNOLOGIES ARE

02:26:20.505 --> 02:26:22.774 region:rollup2
DEVELOPED TO STRENGTHEN OUR

02:26:22.207 --> 02:26:24.342 region:rollup2
SYSTEM.

02:26:22.774 --> 02:26:26.311 region:rollup2
I WOULD EXPECT THOSE PLANS TO BE

02:26:24.342 --> 02:26:27.612 region:rollup2
AMENDED TO INCORPORATE THOSE NEW

02:26:26.311 --> 02:26:29.547 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGIES INTO HEARTENING

02:26:27.612 --> 02:26:31.149 region:rollup2
SYSTEM.

02:26:29.547 --> 02:26:32.450 region:rollup2
I GUESS I GUESS --

02:26:31.149 --> 02:26:34.285 region:rollup2
AND MAYBE THIS IS A ROUNDABOUT

02:26:32.450 --> 02:26:36.021 region:rollup2
WAY OF OF TRY AND MAKE ONE OF

02:26:34.285 --> 02:26:37.489 region:rollup2
THE POINTS THAT SENATOR

02:26:36.021 --> 02:26:39.124 region:rollup2
JACKSON'S MAKING AND MAYBE IT

02:26:37.489 --> 02:26:40.191 region:rollup2
MAYBE IT'S NOT MAYBE IT'S JUST

02:26:39.124 --> 02:26:42.994 region:rollup2
WAY OUT THEE SOMEWHERE.

02:26:40.191 --> 02:26:44.696 region:rollup2
BUT I GUESS I'M I'M STRUGGLING

02:26:42.994 --> 02:26:46.231 region:rollup2
WITH.

02:26:44.696 --> 02:26:48.933 region:rollup2
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT CHANGES IN

02:26:46.231 --> 02:26:50.635 region:rollup2
THE WAY WE LOOK AT LIABILITY.

02:26:48.933 --> 02:26:53.905 region:rollup2
AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PLANS IT

02:26:50.635 --> 02:26:55.540 region:rollup2
MAY TAKE YEARS TO ACCOMPLISH.

02:26:53.905 --> 02:26:56.775 region:rollup2
AND YOU WANT THAT YOU GUYS WANT

02:26:55.540 --> 02:26:58.309 region:rollup2
THAT NOW.

02:26:56.775 --> 02:27:00.545 region:rollup2
BUT THESE PLANTS MIGHT TAKE

02:26:58.309 --> 02:27:03.181 region:rollup2
YEARS TO ACCOMPLISH.

02:27:00.545 --> 02:27:04.883 region:rollup2
AND THERE IS A FEAR THAT.

02:27:03.181 --> 02:27:06.184 region:rollup2
SOME THE UTILITIES HAVEN'T DONE

02:27:04.883 --> 02:27:08.219 region:rollup2
WHAT THEY SHOULD HAVE DONE IN

02:27:06.184 --> 02:27:09.788 region:rollup2
THE FIRST PLACE.

02:27:08.219 --> 02:27:11.323 region:rollup2
HOW DO WE HOW DO WE GET ANY

02:27:09.788 --> 02:27:13.458 region:rollup2
ASSURANCE?

02:27:11.323 --> 02:27:14.559 region:rollup2
THAT YOU ACTUALLY DO.

02:27:13.458 --> 02:27:16.594 region:rollup2
WHAT YOU SAY YOU'RE GONNA NOW

02:27:14.559 --> 02:27:17.996 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE RECORD AT LEAST FOR

02:27:16.594 --> 02:27:19.297 region:rollup2
ONE UTILITY AND I'M NOT THIS IS

02:27:17.996 --> 02:27:20.865 region:rollup2
NOT DIRECT TO YOU SIR BECAUSE OF

02:27:19.297 --> 02:27:22.100 region:rollup2
HERE AT THIS YEAR IT'S NOT?

02:27:20.865 --> 02:27:23.535 region:rollup2
THE REGULARS FOR WHAT YOU TO IT

02:27:22.100 --> 02:27:25.570 region:rollup2
IS THAT IT ISN'T HASN'T HAPPENED

02:27:23.535 --> 02:27:26.771 region:rollup2
AND SO.

02:27:25.570 --> 02:27:28.239 region:rollup2
WHO WERE ASKED YOU IN SOME WAYS

02:27:26.771 --> 02:27:29.974 region:rollup2
ARE SAYING LIKE TRUST US WE'RE

02:27:28.239 --> 02:27:31.476 region:rollup2
GOING TO GET THIS DONE THE TRACK

02:27:29.974 --> 02:27:33.978 region:rollup2
RECORDS DON'T?

02:27:31.476 --> 02:27:36.414 region:rollup2
DON'T FOLLOW THAT COURSE AND I

02:27:33.978 --> 02:27:38.550 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S PART OF THE CONCERN.

02:27:36.414 --> 02:27:40.185 region:rollup2
UP ALL I CAN SUGGEST AN AND TOM

02:27:38.550 --> 02:27:42.087 region:rollup2
ALL DEFERRED OR COLLEAGUES THAT

02:27:40.185 --> 02:27:43.388 region:rollup2
IS THAT --

02:27:42.087 --> 02:27:44.789 region:rollup2
PART OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL

02:27:43.388 --> 02:27:47.225 region:rollup2
SETS A HIGHER STANDARD FOR

02:27:44.789 --> 02:27:48.993 region:rollup2
UTILITIES IN THESE NEW PLANTS.

02:27:47.225 --> 02:27:51.563 region:rollup2
SO IF YOU VIOLATE THAT NEW

02:27:48.993 --> 02:27:52.630 region:rollup2
STANDARD YOU WILL BE LIABLE SO

02:27:51.563 --> 02:27:53.098 region:rollup2
FOR FOR ME SPEAKING FROM SOME

02:27:52.630 --> 02:27:55.066 region:rollup2
OUTSIDE.

02:27:53.098 --> 02:27:56.801 region:rollup2
THAT'S A HUGE INCENTIVE TO MOVE

02:27:55.066 --> 02:27:59.037 region:rollup2
QUICKLY WERE ALREADY MOVING

02:27:56.801 --> 02:28:01.873 region:rollup2
QUICKLY BECAUSE WE RECOGNIZE

02:27:59.037 --> 02:28:03.074 region:rollup2
THAT THE BROADER RISK AND

02:28:01.873 --> 02:28:04.209 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY WE DON'T HAVE THE

02:28:03.074 --> 02:28:06.311 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY.

02:28:04.209 --> 02:28:09.380 region:rollup2
OUR ONLY OPTION IS TO PASS IT ON

02:28:06.311 --> 02:28:11.149 region:rollup2
TO OUR CUSTOMERS AND OBVIOUSLY I

02:28:09.380 --> 02:28:12.851 region:rollup2
WORK FOR SEVEN ELECTED OFFICIALS

02:28:11.149 --> 02:28:13.952 region:rollup2
WHO HATE EVERY RATE INCREASE BUT

02:28:12.851 --> 02:28:17.122 region:rollup2
DO IT PRUDENTLY.

02:28:13.952 --> 02:28:17.856 region:rollup2
SO.

02:28:17.122 --> 02:28:19.390 region:rollup2
WE'RE GONNA MOVE FORWARD TO

02:28:17.856 --> 02:28:21.760 region:rollup2
LIMIT THAT LIABILITY AS QUICKLY

02:28:19.390 --> 02:28:23.461 region:rollup2
AS WE CAN AND I GUESS I GO BACK

02:28:21.760 --> 02:28:24.429 region:rollup2
TO BUT COMMENT THAT.

02:28:23.461 --> 02:28:26.364 region:rollup2
FRUSTRATES FRUSTRATED ME WHEN I

02:28:24.429 --> 02:28:28.399 region:rollup2

PRESIDENT PICKER SAY.

02:28:28.399 --> 02:28:31.202 region:rollup2
AND MAY GOD TAKING THIS OUT OF

02:28:29.768 --> 02:28:32.871 region:rollup2
CONTEXT IS IS BUT OUR JOB IS TO

02:28:31.202 --> 02:28:33.171 region:rollup2
SLOW THE PROCESS DOWN

02:30:32.624 --> 02:30:35.560 region:rollup2
BECAUSE CALIFORNIA HAS SOME OF

02:30:33.625 --> 02:30:36.828 region:rollup2
THE HIGHEST.

02:30:35.560 --> 02:30:38.563 region:rollup2
ELECTRIC RATES IN THE NATION FAR

02:30:36.828 --> 02:30:39.731 region:rollup2
TOO MANY RATE PAYERS.

02:30:38.563 --> 02:30:41.633 region:rollup2
ARE FINDING IT DIFFICULT TO PAY

02:30:39.731 --> 02:30:42.934 region:rollup2
THEIR ENERGY BILLS.

02:30:41.633 --> 02:30:45.703 region:rollup2
DISCONNECTION RATES ARE STEADILY

02:30:42.934 --> 02:30:46.271 region:rollup2
RISING WITH MORE THAN EIGHT

02:30:45.703 --> 02:30:47.839 region:rollup2
HUNDRED THOUSAND CALIFORNIA

02:30:46.271 --> 02:30:48.406 region:rollup2
HOUSEHOLDS GETTING THEIR SERVICE

02:30:47.839 --> 02:30:49.807 region:rollup2
SHUT OFF IN THE MOST RECENT

02:30:48.406 --> 02:30:51.509 region:rollup2
YEAR.

02:30:49.807 --> 02:30:53.745 region:rollup2
WHICH IS A 60% INCREASE FROM

02:30:51.509 --> 02:30:55.079 region:rollup2
JUST FIVE YEARS AGO.

02:30:53.745 --> 02:30:57.749 region:rollup2
SERVICE BUT SHUT OFF RATES IN

02:30:55.079 --> 02:31:00.551 region:rollup2
SOME COMMUNITIES RANGE FROM 20%.

02:30:57.749 --> 02:31:01.653 region:rollup2
TO ITS HIGHEST 32%.

02:31:00.551 --> 02:31:03.821 region:rollup2
THE CHALLENGE OF AFFORDABILITY

02:31:01.653 --> 02:31:04.989 region:rollup2
IS ONLY GOING TO GET WORSE.

02:31:03.821 --> 02:31:06.090 region:rollup2
OUR ALREADY HIGH ENERGY RATES

02:31:04.989 --> 02:31:07.825 region:rollup2
ARE LIKELY TO CONTINUE TO

02:31:06.090 --> 02:31:08.826 region:rollup2
INCREASE WELL ABOVE INFLATION.

02:31:07.825 --> 02:31:10.895 region:rollup2
TO PAY FOR A WIDE RANGE OF

02:31:08.826 --> 02:31:11.963 region:rollup2
UTILITY PROGRAMS.

02:31:10.895 --> 02:31:13.298 region:rollup2
IN REGARDS TO WILDFIRE

02:31:11.963 --> 02:31:15.300 region:rollup2
PREVENTION.

02:31:13.298 --> 02:31:17.468 region:rollup2
KEEP IN MIND THAT CALIFORNIA'S

02:31:15.300 --> 02:31:18.836 region:rollup2
RATE PAYERS ARE THE ONES PAYING

02:31:17.468 --> 02:31:20.672 region:rollup2
HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS

02:31:18.836 --> 02:31:22.106 region:rollup2

PREVENTION AND MITIGATION

02:31:22.106 --> 02:31:26.644 region:rollup2

02:31:24.475 --> 02:31:28.880 region:rollup2
UTILITY SHAREHOLDERS DO NOT PAY

02:31:26.644 --> 02:31:30.248 region:rollup2
FOR THIS PREVENTION WORK.

02:31:28.880 --> 02:31:31.349 region:rollup2
AND AT LEAST IN THE CASE OF PGD

02:31:30.248 --> 02:31:33.217 region:rollup2
CUSTOMERS.

02:31:31.349 --> 02:31:34.686 region:rollup2
RATEPAYERS ARE NOT GETTING GOOD

02:31:33.217 --> 02:31:35.787 region:rollup2
RESULTS FOR THEIR MONEY.

02:31:34.686 --> 02:31:37.789 region:rollup2

AGAINST THAT BACKDROP IT IS

02:31:38.957 --> 02:31:42.126 region:rollup2
IMPERATIVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT

02:31:40.158 --> 02:31:43.328 region:rollup2
RATE PAYERS ARE ALREADY PAYING

02:31:42.126 --> 02:31:45.096 region:rollup2
MORE THAN THEIR FAIR SHARE WITH

02:31:43.328 --> 02:31:46.597 region:rollup2
MIXED RESULTS.

02:31:45.096 --> 02:31:48.099 region:rollup2
RAY PAIR SHOULD BE PROTECTED

02:31:46.597 --> 02:31:48.600 region:rollup2

02:31:52.904 --> 02:31:55.340 region:rollup2

02:31:53.705 --> 02:31:58.676 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PUTTING

02:31:55.340 --> 02:32:00.178 region:rollup2
CONSUMERS AND FIRE VICTIMS. FOR

02:31:58.676 --> 02:32:02.180 region:rollup2
FOR WILD FIRES CAUSED BY UTILITY

02:32:00.178 --> 02:32:03.581 region:rollup2
NEGLIGENCE.

02:32:02.180 --> 02:32:05.083 region:rollup2
RATEPAYERS SHOULD NOT HAVE TO

02:32:03.581 --> 02:32:06.517 region:rollup2
PAY FOR THE MISTAKES AND

02:32:05.083 --> 02:32:08.987 region:rollup2
MISMANAGEMENT OF THE UTILITIES

02:32:06.517 --> 02:32:10.288 region:rollup2
NO WAY NO HOW.

02:32:08.987 --> 02:32:11.356 region:rollup2
TRY TELLING NORTH BAY FIRE

02:32:10.288 --> 02:32:12.991 region:rollup2
VICTIMS THAT THEIR ENERGY BILLS

02:32:11.356 --> 02:32:15.026 region:rollup2
WILL GO UP.

02:32:12.991 --> 02:32:15.693 region:rollup2
BECAUSE P. GENIE DIDN'T DO THE

02:32:15.026 --> 02:32:16.728 region:rollup2
TREE TRIMMING IT WAS SUPPOSED TO

02:32:15.693 --> 02:32:19.364 region:rollup2

02:32:16.728 --> 02:32:21.065 region:rollup2
WITH THEIR RATE PAYERS DOLLARS.

02:32:19.364 --> 02:32:22.367 region:rollup2
ALSO WEAKENING UTILITY

02:32:21.065 --> 02:32:24.435 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABILITY FOR MAKING

02:32:22.367 --> 02:32:25.937 region:rollup2
MISTAKES IS BAD POLICY.

02:32:24.435 --> 02:32:27.205 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT DESTROYS UTILITY

02:32:25.937 --> 02:32:28.806 region:rollup2
INCENTIVES TO IMPROVE WILDFIRE

02:32:27.205 --> 02:32:29.974 region:rollup2
PREVENTION.

02:32:28.806 --> 02:32:32.510 region:rollup2
WE NEED MORE ACCOUNTABILITY NOT

02:32:29.974 --> 02:32:33.578 region:rollup2
LESS.

02:32:32.510 --> 02:32:35.013 region:rollup2
THIS IS WHY TURN HAS BEEN

02:32:39.550 --> 02:32:42.220 region:rollup2
THE BILL WEAKENS THE LEGAL

RESPONSIBILITY OF UTILITIES BY

02:32:42.220 --> 02:32:45.623 region:rollup2

02:32:55.400 --> 02:33:00.304 region:rollup2
WE URGE YOU TO REJECT THESE

CALLING YOU TO REJECT AB.

02:33:03.441 --> 02:33:06.444 region:rollup2
THIRTY THREE WHOSE BASIC

02:33:04.375 --> 02:33:08.413 region:rollup2
PREMISES THAT RATEPAYERS AND NOT

02:33:06.444 --> 02:33:10.148 region:rollup2
UTILITY SHAREHOLDERS SHOULD

02:33:08.413 --> 02:33:11.783 region:rollup2
PROVIDE UP FRONT FUNDING FOR

02:33:10.148 --> 02:33:14.085 region:rollup2
SECURITIZATION COSTS RESULTING

FROM P. GENIES NEGLIGENCE.

02:33:14.085 --> 02:33:16.888 region:rollup2
AGAIN REPAIRS ALREADY PAY FOR

02:33:15.753 --> 02:33:18.089 region:rollup2
PREVENTION COSTS SO WHY SHOULD

02:33:16.888 --> 02:33:20.658 region:rollup2
WE ALSO BE EXPECTED TO PAY EVEN

02:33:18.089 --> 02:33:21.125 region:rollup2
TEMPORARILY. FOR ANY COSTS

02:33:20.658 --> 02:33:23.127 region:rollup2
RESULTING FROM UTILITY

02:33:21.125 --> 02:33:24.996 region:rollup2
NEGLIGENCE.

02:33:23.127 --> 02:33:26.898 region:rollup2
NOW SWITCHING TO WHAT SHOULD BE

02:33:24.996 --> 02:33:28.566 region:rollup2
DONE IN REGARDS TO WILD FIRES

02:33:26.898 --> 02:33:29.667 region:rollup2
ARE CAUSED BY UTILITY FACILITIES

02:33:28.566 --> 02:33:31.302 region:rollup2
BUT NOT THE RESULT OF UTILITY

02:33:29.667 --> 02:33:33.204 region:rollup2
NEGLIGENCE.

02:33:31.302 --> 02:33:35.406 region:rollup2
TURN SUGGESTS EXPLORING A BROAD

02:33:33.204 --> 02:33:36.541 region:rollup2
BASED COMPENSATION MECHANISM

02:33:35.406 --> 02:33:38.443 region:rollup2
THAT EQUITABLY ALLOCATES

02:33:36.541 --> 02:33:39.911 region:rollup2
COMPENSATION FOR CATASTROPHIC

02:33:38.443 --> 02:33:41.846 region:rollup2
LOSSES AND DOESN'T FURTHER

02:33:39.911 --> 02:33:43.181 region:rollup2
BURDEN RATEPAYERS.

02:33:41.846 --> 02:33:43.715 region:rollup2
THE FUNDING SOLUTIONS NEED TO

02:33:43.181 --> 02:33:45.283 region:rollup2
LOOK BEYOND THE UTILITIES

02:33:43.715 --> 02:33:46.350 region:rollup2
SECTOR.

02:33:45.283 --> 02:33:47.985 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WILD FIRES ARE NOT JUST

02:33:46.350 --> 02:33:49.153 region:rollup2
A UTILITY ISSUE.

02:33:47.985 --> 02:33:49.987 region:rollup2

02:33:52.123 --> 02:33:53.758 region:rollup2
WE SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT

02:33:53.224 --> 02:33:55.993 region:rollup2
SOLUTIONS LIKE A FLORIDA

02:33:53.758 --> 02:33:57.695 region:rollup2
HURRICANE CATASTROPHE FUND.

02:33:55.993 --> 02:33:58.763 region:rollup2

CONDEMNATION AS PROPOSED BY THE

02:34:05.903 --> 02:34:09.140 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR IS ONE WAY.

02:34:07.638 --> 02:34:09.740 region:rollup2
BUT NOT THE ONLY WAY TO PROTECT

02:34:09.140 --> 02:34:12.410 region:rollup2
RATE PAYERS FROM ULTIMATELY

02:34:09.740 --> 02:34:14.312 region:rollup2
PAYING LIABILITY COSTS.

02:34:12.410 --> 02:34:15.646 region:rollup2
IT'S WORTHWHILE IDEA BUT NOT A

02:34:15.646 --> 02:34:19.183 region:rollup2
HEARD FROM OTHERS TODAY.

02:34:17.915 --> 02:34:20.818 region:rollup2
ULTIMATELY DEVELOPING A BROAD

02:34:19.183 --> 02:34:22.854 region:rollup2
BASE COMPENSATION MECHANISM IS

02:34:20.818 --> 02:34:23.554 region:rollup2
COMPLEX AND CHALLENGING.

02:34:22.854 --> 02:34:24.288 region:rollup2
AND NOT SOMETHING WE BELIEVE

02:34:23.554 --> 02:34:26.824 region:rollup2
THAT CAN BE THOUGHTFULLY

02:34:24.288 --> 02:34:28.192 region:rollup2

02:34:35.433 --> 02:34:38.636 region:rollup2
REGARDING THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN

02:34:36.667 --> 02:34:40.338 region:rollup2
NORTH BAY FIRES THE TRUTH IS WE

02:34:38.636 --> 02:34:41.806 region:rollup2
HAVE A DANGEROUSLY INCOMPLETE

02:34:40.338 --> 02:34:43.474 region:rollup2

TRYING TO ADDRESS.

02:34:43.474 --> 02:34:46.677 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WITHOUT THE TUBS FIRE

02:34:44.709 --> 02:34:48.312 region:rollup2

02:34:46.677 --> 02:34:50.248 region:rollup2
MUCH PROPERTY DAMAGE WILL BE THE

RESULT OF UTILITY NEGLIGENCE.

02:34:50.248 --> 02:34:53.818 region:rollup2

02:34:50.681 --> 02:34:55.520 region:rollup2
ATTRIBUTABLE. TWO OTHER CAUSES.

02:34:53.818 --> 02:34:57.088 region:rollup2
SO IT'S PREMATURE TO CONSIDER

02:34:55.520 --> 02:34:58.156 region:rollup2
BILLS LIKE A. B. THIRTY THREE

02:34:57.088 --> 02:34:59.056 region:rollup2

RIGHTFULLY BELONG TO UTILITY

IT'S TELLING OF THE COMMUNITY OF

02:36:47.965 --> 02:36:52.069 region:rollup2
A SACRIFICE IT WE CANNOT --

02:36:51.135 --> 02:36:54.705 region:rollup2

I AT THIS POINT  YOU KNOW WE

REMAINS.

02:37:03.814 --> 02:37:07.084 region:rollup2

02:37:07.084 --> 02:37:10.788 region:rollup2
DELIBERATE PROCESS A TO DRESS A

02:37:09.453 --> 02:37:12.390 region:rollup2
COMPLEX COMBINATION OF ISSUES

02:37:10.788 --> 02:37:12.823 region:rollup2
GOING FORWARD WITH WILDFIRE

02:37:12.823 --> 02:37:17.728 region:rollup2
PREVENTIONS.

02:37:15.926 --> 02:37:19.463 region:rollup2
I AS A PROFESSOR WAR --

02:37:17.728 --> 02:37:20.064 region:rollup2
ADDRESSED --

02:37:19.463 --> 02:37:21.065 region:rollup2
AT THE FIRST COMMITTEE HEARING

02:37:20.064 --> 02:37:22.366 region:rollup2
--

02:37:21.065 --> 02:37:23.901 region:rollup2
THERE MANY COMPLEX ISSUES

02:37:22.366 --> 02:37:26.337 region:rollup2
RELATED TO LAND USE CURRENT

02:37:23.901 --> 02:37:28.973 region:rollup2
ZONING COST EFFECTIVENESS

02:37:26.337 --> 02:37:30.141 region:rollup2

02:37:28.973 --> 02:37:31.642 region:rollup2
IT THAT MAY BE DIFFICULT TO

02:37:30.141 --> 02:37:33.577 region:rollup2
CONSIDER ALL IN THE NEXT FEW

02:37:31.642 --> 02:37:34.745 region:rollup2
WEEKS UP CERTAINLY THAT IS NOT

02:37:33.577 --> 02:37:36.013 region:rollup2
TO SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THE

02:37:34.745 --> 02:37:37.348 region:rollup2
CAPABILITIES OF ANYBODY HERE IN

02:37:36.013 --> 02:37:38.416 region:rollup2
THIS ROOM.

02:37:37.348 --> 02:37:40.451 region:rollup2
UP BUT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF

02:37:38.416 --> 02:37:41.752 region:rollup2
VERY DIFFICULT ISSUES.

02:37:40.451 --> 02:37:43.587 region:rollup2
WE BELIEVE THAT OUR FOCUS SHOULD

02:37:41.752 --> 02:37:44.889 region:rollup2
BE ON THE FOLLOWING ITEMS.

02:37:43.587 --> 02:37:46.023 region:rollup2
FIRST AND FOREMOST RESPONDING TO

02:37:44.889 --> 02:37:47.191 region:rollup2
THE IMMEDIATE NEEDS OF THOSE WH

02:37:46.023 --> 02:37:49.260 region:rollup2
HAVE SFFERED LOSSES IN THE

02:37:47.191 --> 02:37:49.894 region:rollup2
FIRES OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND

02:37:49.260 --> 02:37:50.995 region:rollup2
THE FIRES ARE CURRENTLY BURNING

02:37:49.894 --> 02:37:52.730 region:rollup2
TODAY --

02:37:50.995 --> 02:37:54.098 region:rollup2
SECOND TO TAKE IMMEDIATE ACTION

02:37:52.730 --> 02:37:55.833 region:rollup2
TO REDUCE THE RISK AND MITIGATE

02:37:54.098 --> 02:37:57.368 region:rollup2
THE SIZE A FUTURE FIRES THROUGH

02:37:55.833 --> 02:37:59.503 region:rollup2
VARIOUS ACTIONS WE CAN TAKE SUCH

02:37:57.368 --> 02:38:01.339 region:rollup2
AS REDUCING FUELS --

02:37:59.503 --> 02:38:01.839 region:rollup2
TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THAT FUEL

02:38:01.339 --> 02:38:04.008 region:rollup2
POTENTIALLY IN DIFFERENT

02:38:01.839 --> 02:38:05.509 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT WAYS.

02:38:04.008 --> 02:38:06.978 region:rollup2
GOING FORWARD THE OTHER FORMAL

02:38:05.509 --> 02:38:09.046 region:rollup2
Y. BILLION PROVISION SHOULD BE

02:38:06.978 --> 02:38:10.915 region:rollup2
CONSIDERED IN A LARGER CONTEXT.

02:38:09.046 --> 02:38:12.249 region:rollup2
I'D IT'S NOT TO SAY THAT WE

02:38:10.915 --> 02:38:14.018 region:rollup2
SHOULD NOT LOOK AT THE ISSUE OF

02:38:12.249 --> 02:38:15.453 region:rollup2
INVERSE CONDEMNATION IS TO SAY

02:38:14.018 --> 02:38:16.987 region:rollup2
THAT WE SHOULD CONSIDER IN THE

02:38:15.453 --> 02:38:18.589 region:rollup2
LARGER CONTEXT AND WE SHOULD

02:38:16.987 --> 02:38:19.790 region:rollup2
CONSIDER AT ANOTHER TIME.

02:38:18.589 --> 02:38:21.092 region:rollup2
WE SHOULD SPEND THE TIME AND

02:38:19.790 --> 02:38:22.093 region:rollup2
LIMITED TIME AND ENERGY THAT

02:38:21.092 --> 02:38:24.061 region:rollup2
REMAINS.

02:38:22.093 --> 02:38:24.695 region:rollup2
ON OTHER ISSUES THAT HAVE MORE

02:38:24.061 --> 02:38:25.830 region:rollup2
IMMEDIATE IMPACT I THINK A

02:38:24.695 --> 02:38:27.965 region:rollup2
SENATOR --

02:38:25.830 --> 02:38:30.668 region:rollup2
JACKSON INCIDENT WOULD

02:38:27.965 --> 02:38:32.436 region:rollup2
HIGHLIGHTED A SHORT WHILE AGO.

02:38:30.668 --> 02:38:33.871 region:rollup2
WE ALSO BELIEVE YOU SHOULD

02:38:32.436 --> 02:38:35.239 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO HOLD UTILITY

02:38:33.871 --> 02:38:36.741 region:rollup2
SHAREHOLDERS NOT REPAIRS

02:38:35.239 --> 02:38:37.942 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBLE FOR A WHILE FIRE

02:38:36.741 --> 02:38:39.677 region:rollup2
DAMAGES RESULTING FROM UTILITY

02:38:37.942 --> 02:38:40.911 region:rollup2
NEGLIGENCE.

02:38:39.677 --> 02:38:42.880 region:rollup2
PUTTING HIS GOVERNOR SAID THE

02:38:40.911 --> 02:38:44.482 region:rollup2
LAW MUST ESTABLISH A IN HIS

02:38:42.880 --> 02:38:45.616 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL HOW LONG ASSIST ABBAS

02:38:44.482 --> 02:38:46.884 region:rollup2
POWERFUL INCENTIVES FOR

02:38:45.616 --> 02:38:48.285 region:rollup2
UTILITIES TO DELIVER POWER

02:38:46.884 --> 02:38:49.220 region:rollup2
SAFELY.

02:38:48.285 --> 02:38:50.521 region:rollup2
AND WAS TOLD THOSE WHO FOUGHT

02:38:49.220 --> 02:38:51.989 region:rollup2
WHO RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DAMAGE

02:38:50.521 --> 02:38:53.424 region:rollup2
THEY CAUSE.

02:38:51.989 --> 02:38:54.959 region:rollup2
AND I SAY THAT ONLY TO HIGHLIGHT

02:38:53.424 --> 02:38:56.227 region:rollup2
IT NOT TO IMPLY THAT ANYONE HAS

02:38:54.959 --> 02:38:59.096 region:rollup2
SUGGESTED THAT WE DO ANYTHING

02:38:56.227 --> 02:39:00.164 region:rollup2
OTHER THAN THAT --

02:38:59.096 --> 02:39:01.599 region:rollup2
I WOULD AGREE WITH --

02:39:00.164 --> 02:39:03.134 region:rollup2
THE REPRESENTATIVE FROM TURN

02:39:01.599 --> 02:39:04.468 region:rollup2
MISTER LONG AND THAT WE'RE GOING

02:39:03.134 --> 02:39:06.504 region:rollup2
INCIDENTS WERE UTILITY

02:39:04.468 --> 02:39:08.572 region:rollup2
FACILITIES WERE --

02:39:06.504 --> 02:39:10.207 region:rollup2
BECAUSE BUT NOT NOT THE NET NOT

02:39:08.572 --> 02:39:12.143 region:rollup2
NOT INVOLVING NEGLIGENCE --

02:39:10.207 --> 02:39:14.078 region:rollup2
THAT THERE AT THE CONSTRICTED

02:39:12.143 --> 02:39:15.946 region:rollup2
ACCRETION OF FIND YOU KNOW COULD

02:39:14.078 --> 02:39:17.915 region:rollup2
BE A WAY FOR US TO HELP ADDRESS

02:39:15.946 --> 02:39:18.883 region:rollup2
THOSE ISSUES.

02:39:17.915 --> 02:39:20.317 region:rollup2
SO I WON'T REITERATE UP THOSE

02:39:18.883 --> 02:39:22.753 region:rollup2
POINTS.

02:39:20.317 --> 02:39:24.722 region:rollup2
I EXCEPT TO SAY THAT ELECTRICITY

02:39:22.753 --> 02:39:27.158 region:rollup2
RATE PAYERS SHOULD NOT.

02:39:24.722 --> 02:39:28.959 region:rollup2
AND CANNOT BE THE SOLE SOURCE.

02:39:27.158 --> 02:39:30.928 region:rollup2
OF THAT REVENUE.

02:39:28.959 --> 02:39:31.729 region:rollup2
I BECAUSE THOSE ARE COSTS THAT

02:39:30.928 --> 02:39:34.198 region:rollup2
WILL BE IMPOSED ON OUR

02:39:31.729 --> 02:39:35.766 region:rollup2
BUSINESSES ON OUR RESIDENTS.

02:39:34.198 --> 02:39:37.501 region:rollup2
WHICH IMPACTS OUR ABILITY TO

02:39:35.766 --> 02:39:39.370 region:rollup2
CREATE JOBS IN IMPACTS THE

02:39:37.501 --> 02:39:40.838 region:rollup2
ABILITY OF OUR FAMILIES TO PAY.

02:39:39.370 --> 02:39:42.073 region:rollup2
HOPE FOR THE THINGS THAT THEY

02:39:40.838 --> 02:39:43.808 region:rollup2
NEEDN'T ESPECIALLY HOUSE WERE IN

02:39:42.073 --> 02:39:44.742 region:rollup2
THE MIDST OF SUMMER AND IT'S A

02:39:43.808 --> 02:39:45.543 region:rollup2
HUNDRED DEGREES OUTSIDE HERE IN

02:39:44.742 --> 02:39:46.944 region:rollup2
SACRAMENTO.

02:39:45.543 --> 02:39:50.581 region:rollup2
UMPS FROM THEIR CONDITIONS ARE

02:39:46.944 --> 02:39:52.349 region:rollup2
RUNNING PRETTY STRONG --

02:39:50.581 --> 02:39:53.684 region:rollup2
IS A SENATOR HUESO I BELIEVE --

02:39:52.349 --> 02:39:54.318 region:rollup2
EARLIER MENTIONED --

02:39:53.684 --> 02:39:56.320 region:rollup2
ASKING ASKING LOOKING FOR

02:39:54.318 --> 02:39:57.221 region:rollup2
BAILOUTS.

02:39:56.320 --> 02:39:59.190 region:rollup2
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE

02:39:57.221 --> 02:40:00.791 region:rollup2
THAT REPAIRS HAVE ALREADY PAID

02:39:59.190 --> 02:40:02.793 region:rollup2
FOR THE SYSTEM.

02:40:00.791 --> 02:40:04.795 region:rollup2
I THAT THEY HAVE --

02:40:02.793 --> 02:40:06.430 region:rollup2
INVESTED MONEY IN CALIFORNIA

02:40:04.795 --> 02:40:07.832 region:rollup2
HAVING A SAFE AND RELIABLE A

02:40:06.430 --> 02:40:09.567 region:rollup2
RESILIENT LECTURES THIS ELECTRIC

02:40:07.832 --> 02:40:11.502 region:rollup2
SYSTEM IF THE THAT REVENUE

02:40:09.567 --> 02:40:12.069 region:rollup2
HASN'T BEEN USED IN THE WAY IT

02:40:11.502 --> 02:40:12.903 region:rollup2
WAS INTENDED IT'S IMPORTANT

02:40:12.069 --> 02:40:14.071 region:rollup2
THAT.

02:40:12.903 --> 02:40:15.806 region:rollup2
THAT BE AUDITED THAT WE

02:40:14.071 --> 02:40:17.608 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT IS NOT RATE

02:40:15.806 --> 02:40:19.043 region:rollup2
PAYER FUNDS NOT BE USED.

02:40:17.608 --> 02:40:20.845 region:rollup2
ABOUT TO BAIL OUT UTILITIES AS A

02:40:19.043 --> 02:40:22.246 region:rollup2
RESULT.

02:40:20.845 --> 02:40:23.781 region:rollup2
BUT HE'S ALSO AND I THINK WE'LL

02:40:22.246 --> 02:40:24.448 region:rollup2
CLOSE WITH THIS IMPORTANT NOTE

02:40:23.781 --> 02:40:27.384 region:rollup2
THAT --

02:40:24.448 --> 02:40:30.121 region:rollup2
CHOICES MUST BE MADE I THINK SO

02:40:27.384 --> 02:40:31.155 region:rollup2
CANNELLA NOTED THIS EARLIER --

02:40:30.121 --> 02:40:32.756 region:rollup2
WE HAVE WE'RE DOING A LOT OF

02:40:31.155 --> 02:40:34.391 region:rollup2
THINGS WERE ASKING UTILITIES TO

02:40:32.756 --> 02:40:36.660 region:rollup2
DO A LOT OF THINGS RATE PAYERS

02:40:34.391 --> 02:40:39.029 region:rollup2
ARE PAYING. FOR THOSE THINGS I

02:40:36.660 --> 02:40:41.799 region:rollup2
WOULD NOTE IT'S NOT UTILITY

02:40:39.029 --> 02:40:42.399 region:rollup2
MONEY IT'S REPAIR MONEY.

02:40:41.799 --> 02:40:43.601 region:rollup2
SO WHAT ARE WE SPENDING THE

02:40:42.399 --> 02:40:44.668 region:rollup2
MONEY ON ARE WE GETTING MORE

02:40:43.601 --> 02:40:46.170 region:rollup2
PAYING.

02:40:44.668 --> 02:40:47.271 region:rollup2
FOR AND MORE IMPORTANTLY.

02:40:46.170 --> 02:40:48.873 region:rollup2
MAYBE WE SHOULD CONSIDER THAT WE

02:40:47.271 --> 02:40:50.774 region:rollup2
CANNOT DO EVERYTHING THAT WE

02:40:48.873 --> 02:40:52.309 region:rollup2
HAVE COMMITTED ARE UTILITIES AND

02:40:50.774 --> 02:40:53.477 region:rollup2
CONSEQUENTLY A REPAIR FUNDS TO

02:40:52.309 --> 02:40:54.245 region:rollup2
GO.

02:40:53.477 --> 02:40:56.147 region:rollup2
FOR MAYBE WE NEED TO MAKE SOME

02:40:54.245 --> 02:40:57.781 region:rollup2
CHOICES DIFFICULT CHOICES NONE

02:40:56.147 --> 02:40:59.416 region:rollup2
THE LESS BUT I THINK IF WE'RE

02:40:57.781 --> 02:41:00.751 region:rollup2
GOING TO CONSIDER.

02:40:59.416 --> 02:41:02.253 region:rollup2
THAT WE ARE IN A A CRITICAL NEW

02:41:00.751 --> 02:41:03.254 region:rollup2
NORMAL.

02:41:02.253 --> 02:41:05.022 region:rollup2
THAT MAYBE SOME OF THOSE

02:41:03.254 --> 02:41:06.790 region:rollup2
DECISIONS WE MADE IN THE PAST

02:41:05.022 --> 02:41:07.791 region:rollup2
DESERVE RECONSIDERATION.

02:41:06.790 --> 02:41:09.894 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT TO CALL OUT ANY

02:41:07.791 --> 02:41:10.361 region:rollup2
SPECIFIC POLICY SIMPLY TO STATE

02:41:09.894 --> 02:41:11.695 region:rollup2
THAT WE JUST CAN'T DO

02:41:10.361 --> 02:41:13.330 region:rollup2
EVERYTHING.

02:41:11.695 --> 02:41:15.166 region:rollup2
I THINK IS A MISTER SMARTY JONES

02:41:13.330 --> 02:41:16.500 region:rollup2
SAWYER NOTED EARLIER.

02:41:15.166 --> 02:41:17.067 region:rollup2
THERE'S NO MAGICAL POT OF MONEY

02:41:16.500 --> 02:41:19.069 region:rollup2
OUT THERE UP FOR US TO DRAW

02:41:17.067 --> 02:41:20.271 region:rollup2
FROM.

02:41:19.069 --> 02:41:21.338 region:rollup2
THE CITY HAS BEEN DOING ALL I

02:41:20.271 --> 02:41:23.474 region:rollup2
SEVERAL YEARS.

02:41:21.338 --> 02:41:24.074 region:rollup2
UP FINANCIALLY BUT THAT IS NOT

02:41:23.474 --> 02:41:24.341 region:rollup2
TO SAY THAT THAT WILL CONTINUE

02:41:24.074 --> 02:41:29.079 region:rollup2
FOREVER.

02:41:24.341 --> 02:41:30.381 region:rollup2
SO THANK YOU.

02:41:29.079 --> 02:41:31.415 region:rollup2
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN --

02:41:30.381 --> 02:41:33.083 region:rollup2
AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE

02:41:31.415 --> 02:41:34.718 region:rollup2
MICHAEL POKER DORO ON BEHALF OF

02:41:33.083 --> 02:41:36.253 region:rollup2
THE AG ENERGY CONSUMERS SOCIAIS

02:41:34.718 --> 02:41:37.988 region:rollup2
XIN WE REPRESENT THE STATE'S

02:41:36.253 --> 02:41:39.690 region:rollup2
FARMING AND FOOD PROCESSING

02:41:37.988 --> 02:41:41.625 region:rollup2
INDUSTRIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE.

02:41:39.690 --> 02:41:43.260 region:rollup2
LET ME START BY SAYING THAT I

02:41:41.625 --> 02:41:44.662 region:rollup2
TOO AGREE WITH LUPUS RADIUS

02:41:43.260 --> 02:41:46.664 region:rollup2
SPOKE ABOUT ON TUESDAY.

02:41:44.662 --> 02:41:48.132 region:rollup2
AT THE NUMBER ONE PRIORITY NEEDS

02:41:46.664 --> 02:41:50.134 region:rollup2
TO MAKE SURE THAT FIRE VICTIMS

02:41:48.132 --> 02:41:51.936 region:rollup2
ARE MADE WHOLE AND HOPEFULLY

02:41:50.134 --> 02:41:53.237 region:rollup2
EVERYONE CAN AGREE TO THAT.

02:41:51.936 --> 02:41:54.838 region:rollup2
WHAT REALLY BECOMES A DIFFICULT

02:41:53.237 --> 02:41:56.073 region:rollup2
TASK FOR ALL OF YOU IS HOW DO

02:41:54.838 --> 02:41:58.409 region:rollup2
YOU DO THAT AND WHO IS

02:41:56.073 --> 02:42:00.144 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBLE TO PAY FOR THAT IS

02:41:58.409 --> 02:42:01.412 region:rollup2
THE MORE DIFFICULT CHALLENGES?

02:42:00.144 --> 02:42:03.147 region:rollup2
YOU'VE HEARD SOME SUGGESTIONS

02:42:01.412 --> 02:42:05.316 region:rollup2
FROM SOE OF MY COLLEAGUES THAT

02:42:03.147 --> 02:42:06.417 region:rollup2
ARE ALSO RATE PAYER ADVOCATES.

02:42:05.316 --> 02:42:07.751 region:rollup2
UNFORTUNATELY I DIDN'T HEAR A

02:42:06.417 --> 02:42:09.019 region:rollup2
LOT OF SOLUTIONS FROM THE FIRST

02:42:07.751 --> 02:42:11.088 region:rollup2
PANEL TODAY --

02:42:09.019 --> 02:42:12.623 region:rollup2
A LOT OF EXCUSES A LOT OF

02:42:11.088 --> 02:42:15.226 region:rollup2
POSITIONING IN BLAME POINTING AT

02:42:12.623 --> 02:42:16.927 region:rollup2
PGA IN A THIS ISN'T JUST ABOUT

02:42:15.226 --> 02:42:19.330 region:rollup2
PGA NAY IT'S ABOUT THE RATE

02:42:16.927 --> 02:42:20.397 region:rollup2
PAYERS AND UNFORTUNATELY. FOR A

02:42:19.330 --> 02:42:22.233 region:rollup2
LOT OF THOSE FOLKS I THINK

02:42:20.397 --> 02:42:24.001 region:rollup2
THEY'D BE PERFECTLY HAPPY IF

02:42:22.233 --> 02:42:26.270 region:rollup2
RATE PAYERS WERE LEFT HOLDING

02:42:24.001 --> 02:42:27.838 region:rollup2
THE BAG FOR ALL OF THESE COSTS.

02:42:26.270 --> 02:42:29.340 region:rollup2
AND WE CAN'T BE AND WE SHOULDN'T

02:42:27.838 --> 02:42:31.208 region:rollup2
BE.

02:42:29.340 --> 02:42:33.377 region:rollup2
WHY SHOULDN'T WE BE WE DON'T

02:42:31.208 --> 02:42:34.778 region:rollup2
MAKE DECISIONS AS RATEPAYERS

02:42:33.377 --> 02:42:36.146 region:rollup2
UTILITIES MAKE THE DECISIONS ON

02:42:34.778 --> 02:42:37.648 region:rollup2
WHAT GETS FUNDED?

02:42:36.146 --> 02:42:39.617 region:rollup2
WE DON'T MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT

02:42:37.648 --> 02:42:41.652 region:rollup2
FORESTRY MANAGEMENT PRACTICES

02:42:39.617 --> 02:42:43.354 region:rollup2
THE STATE MAKES THOSE DECISIONS.

02:42:41.652 --> 02:42:44.888 region:rollup2
WE DON'T MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT

02:42:43.354 --> 02:42:47.324 region:rollup2
LOCAL LAND USE PLANNING AND

02:42:44.888 --> 02:42:49.960 region:rollup2
PUTTING HOMES IN HARM'S WAY.

02:42:47.324 --> 02:42:50.527 region:rollup2
WE HAVE ZERO CONTROL OVER THESE

02:42:49.960 --> 02:42:51.962 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT ARE DRIVING THE

02:42:50.527 --> 02:42:53.264 region:rollup2
COSTS.

02:42:51.962 --> 02:42:55.366 region:rollup2
WHICH BRINGS ME TO A REALLY

02:42:53.264 --> 02:42:57.001 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT POINT I AGREE WE ARE

02:42:55.366 --> 02:42:59.336 region:rollup2
FACING A NEW NORMAL THAT NEW

02:42:57.001 --> 02:43:02.006 region:rollup2
NORMAL IS MORE COSTLY.

02:42:59.336 --> 02:43:03.307 region:rollup2
AND LARGER WILDFIRES.

02:43:02.006 --> 02:43:05.676 region:rollup2
I THINK IT GOES BEYOND CLIMATE

02:43:03.307 --> 02:43:06.910 region:rollup2
POLICY HOWEVER IT GOES BACK TO

02:43:05.676 --> 02:43:08.445 region:rollup2
WHAT I JUST STATED.

02:43:06.910 --> 02:43:10.180 region:rollup2
SOME FORESTRY MANAGEMENT

02:43:08.445 --> 02:43:11.715 region:rollup2
PRACTICES IN THE STATE THAT HAVE

02:43:10.180 --> 02:43:12.883 region:rollup2
BEEN LACKING MISTER DOLLY AND

02:43:11.715 --> 02:43:13.917 region:rollup2
OTHERS AND MISSED MAYES AND

02:43:12.883 --> 02:43:15.786 region:rollup2
OTHERS HAVE BROUGHT THAT UP

02:43:13.917 --> 02:43:18.055 region:rollup2
REPEATEDLY WE AGREE WITH THAT

02:43:15.786 --> 02:43:19.990 region:rollup2
STATE HAS SOME CULPABILITY HERE.

02:43:18.055 --> 02:43:20.491 region:rollup2
SOME RESPONSIBILITY HERE AND

02:43:19.990 --> 02:43:21.458 region:rollup2
NEEDS TO BE PART OF THAT

02:43:20.491 --> 02:43:23.193 region:rollup2
SOLUTION.

02:43:21.458 --> 02:43:25.629 region:rollup2
LOCAL LAND USE PLAN.

02:43:23.193 --> 02:43:28.032 region:rollup2
IS DONE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL.

02:43:25.629 --> 02:43:30.467 region:rollup2
WE ARE GETTING MORE COSTLY FIRES

02:43:28.032 --> 02:43:32.302 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THERE ARE FRANKLY MANY

02:43:30.467 --> 02:43:34.638 region:rollup2
MORE HOMES IN HARM'S WAY.

02:43:32.302 --> 02:43:35.939 region:rollup2
PLAIN AND SIMPLE THOSE HARM

02:43:34.638 --> 02:43:37.641 region:rollup2
THOSE HOMES ARE NOT IN HARM'S

02:43:35.939 --> 02:43:39.276 region:rollup2
WAY THE COSTS WOULD NOT BE AS

02:43:37.641 --> 02:43:40.911 region:rollup2
GREAT AS THEY ARE TODAY.

02:43:39.276 --> 02:43:42.746 region:rollup2
BUT WE HAVE THE SITUATION WE

02:43:40.911 --> 02:43:43.881 region:rollup2
HAVE AND WE HAVE TO ADDRESS AND

02:43:42.746 --> 02:43:45.683 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT'S THE RELEASED THE

02:43:43.881 --> 02:43:48.886 region:rollup2
RULE FOR THIS COMMITTEE.

02:43:45.683 --> 02:43:50.054 region:rollup2
SO LET ME TRY AND IN TURN --

02:43:48.886 --> 02:43:53.624 region:rollup2
TO A REAL IMPORTANT POINT FOR

02:43:50.054 --> 02:43:54.525 region:rollup2
THOSE REASONS WE DO SUPPORT.

02:43:53.624 --> 02:43:56.393 region:rollup2
OVERVIEW OF THE INVERSE

02:43:54.525 --> 02:43:58.862 region:rollup2
CONDEMNATION AND A WAY TO BETTER

02:43:56.393 --> 02:43:59.563 region:rollup2
BALANCE THE LIABILITY GOING

02:43:58.862 --> 02:44:01.498 region:rollup2
FORWARD.

02:43:59.563 --> 02:44:02.966 region:rollup2
WHETHER WE ADDRESS THAT.

02:44:01.498 --> 02:44:04.301 region:rollup2
THIS YEAR WHICH WOULD BE MY

02:44:02.966 --> 02:44:06.837 region:rollup2
PREFERENCE OR WE ADDRESS IT

02:44:04.301 --> 02:44:08.405 region:rollup2
GOING FORWARD IT IS PART.

02:44:06.837 --> 02:44:10.741 region:rollup2
OF A COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTION HAT

02:44:08.405 --> 02:44:12.643 region:rollup2
NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED HOPEFULLY

02:44:10.741 --> 02:44:14.111 region:rollup2
WE CAN AGREE ON A A FEW OTHER

02:44:12.643 --> 02:44:16.914 region:rollup2
THINGS MOVING FORWARD SO WHAT'S

02:44:14.111 --> 02:44:17.548 region:rollup2
A MORE BALANCED AND SUSTAINABLE

02:44:16.914 --> 02:44:20.184 region:rollup2
SOLUTION LOOK LIKE GOING FORWARD

02:44:17.548 --> 02:44:21.852 region:rollup2
--

02:44:20.184 --> 02:44:23.253 region:rollup2
NO AND AND ONE OTHER POINT I

02:44:21.852 --> 02:44:24.955 region:rollup2
WANT TO MAKE IS WERE NOT HERE

02:44:23.253 --> 02:44:26.323 region:rollup2
PIMPIN FOR THE UTILITIES NOT BY

02:44:24.955 --> 02:44:28.258 region:rollup2
ANY STRETCH OF THE IMAGINATION

02:44:26.323 --> 02:44:29.827 region:rollup2
I'M ONE OF THE LEADING CRITICS

02:44:28.258 --> 02:44:30.327 region:rollup2
OF UTILITIES IN THE STATE I'VE

02:44:29.827 --> 02:44:31.929 region:rollup2
BEEN --

02:44:30.327 --> 02:44:33.430 region:rollup2
UTILITY RATE PAYER ADVOCATE FOR

02:44:31.929 --> 02:44:35.399 region:rollup2
OVER TWENTY YEARS.

02:44:33.430 --> 02:44:37.534 region:rollup2
I RARELY GET UP AND TESTIFY IN

02:44:35.399 --> 02:44:38.435 region:rollup2
SUPPORT OF PGA NAY BUT WE AGREE

02:44:37.534 --> 02:44:40.504 region:rollup2
WITH THEM HERE THAT THIS

02:44:38.435 --> 02:44:41.739 region:rollup2
LIABILITY ISSUE NEEDS TO BE

02:44:40.504 --> 02:44:43.874 region:rollup2
REFORMED.

02:44:41.739 --> 02:44:44.508 region:rollup2
AS WE MOVE FORWARD --

02:44:43.874 --> 02:44:46.276 region:rollup2
AND SO THAT'S FIRST AND FOREMOST

02:44:44.508 --> 02:44:48.212 region:rollup2
--

02:44:46.276 --> 02:44:48.812 region:rollup2
THEY NEED TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE

02:44:48.212 --> 02:44:51.081 region:rollup2
WHEN THEY'RE NEGLIGENT I DON'T

02:44:48.812 --> 02:44:52.282 region:rollup2
THINK ANYONE DISAGREES WITH THAT

02:44:51.081 --> 02:44:53.951 region:rollup2
I DON'T EVEN THINK P. JEANNIE

02:44:52.282 --> 02:44:56.053 region:rollup2
WILL DISAGREE WITH THAT.

02:44:53.951 --> 02:44:57.688 region:rollup2
THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN UTILITY

02:44:56.053 --> 02:44:58.922 region:rollup2
RATE PAYERS WILL CONTINUE TO

02:44:57.688 --> 02:45:00.190 region:rollup2
BEAR THE BRUNT OF COSTS OF

02:44:58.922 --> 02:45:01.558 region:rollup2
HARDENING THE SYSTEM AS WE MOVE

02:45:00.190 --> 02:45:03.060 region:rollup2
FORWARD.

02:45:01.558 --> 02:45:04.094 region:rollup2
WE ALL RECOGNIZE ITS RATEPAYERS

02:45:03.060 --> 02:45:05.429 region:rollup2
WOULD ALL LIKE TO SAY THAT THERE

02:45:04.094 --> 02:45:07.197 region:rollup2
WON'T BE INCREASES FOR

02:45:05.429 --> 02:45:07.965 region:rollup2
RATEPAYERS THERE WILL BE.

02:45:07.197 --> 02:45:09.767 region:rollup2
THE SYSTEM IS GOING TO BE

02:45:07.965 --> 02:45:11.468 region:rollup2
HARDENED AND WILL THE UTILITIES

02:45:09.767 --> 02:45:14.037 region:rollup2
MAKE THOSE INVESTMENTS THE RATE

02:45:11.468 --> 02:45:15.539 region:rollup2
PAYERS PAPER THOSE INVESTMENTS

02:45:14.037 --> 02:45:16.440 region:rollup2
NOT THE UTILITY SHAREHOLDERS.

02:45:15.539 --> 02:45:17.775 region:rollup2
SO WE'RE ON THE HOOK FOR THAT

02:45:16.440 --> 02:45:20.043 region:rollup2
GOING FORWARD WE'RE GOING TO

02:45:17.775 --> 02:45:21.645 region:rollup2
BEAR THE BRUNT OF THAT.

02:45:20.043 --> 02:45:23.180 region:rollup2
INSURERS NEED TO STEP UP AND BE

02:45:21.645 --> 02:45:25.249 region:rollup2
MORE RESPONSIBLE AGREE WITH MARK

02:45:23.180 --> 02:45:27.117 region:rollup2
JOSEPH ON THOSE WHEN THE

02:45:25.249 --> 02:45:28.285 region:rollup2
INEVITABLE STRIKES AFTER ALL

02:45:27.117 --> 02:45:30.053 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHY WE ALL BY HOMEOWNERS

02:45:28.285 --> 02:45:31.455 region:rollup2
INSURANCE IT NEEDS TO BE PART OF

02:45:30.053 --> 02:45:33.557 region:rollup2
THE SOLUTION GOING FORWARD.

02:45:31.455 --> 02:45:35.159 region:rollup2
NOT THE ONLY PART BUT PART OF

02:45:33.557 --> 02:45:36.360 region:rollup2
THAT SOLUTION GOING FORWARD.

02:45:35.159 --> 02:45:38.262 region:rollup2
AND THEN LET'S NOT LOSE SIGHT OF

02:45:36.360 --> 02:45:39.963 region:rollup2
THE BEEN A LOT OF REPORTS ABOUT

02:45:38.262 --> 02:45:41.598 region:rollup2
THE CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS FROM

02:45:39.963 --> 02:45:42.633 region:rollup2
THESE FIRES.

02:45:41.598 --> 02:45:45.169 region:rollup2
OKAY SOME OF THOSE REPORTS

02:45:42.633 --> 02:45:47.204 region:rollup2
SUGGEST THAT WE'RE GETTING MORE.

02:45:45.169 --> 02:45:49.540 region:rollup2
CO TWO BEING RELEASED INTO THE

02:45:47.204 --> 02:45:51.208 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENT ON A DAILY BASIS.

02:45:49.540 --> 02:45:53.310 region:rollup2
THAT IS BEING GENERATED BY THE

02:45:51.208 --> 02:45:54.812 region:rollup2
ENTIRE ECONOMY OF THE STATE OF

02:45:53.310 --> 02:45:56.280 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA RIGHT NOW.

02:45:54.812 --> 02:45:58.315 region:rollup2
THAT TELLS ME WE SHOULD BE

02:45:56.280 --> 02:45:59.817 region:rollup2
PRIORITIZING SOME OF THE GT R.

02:45:58.315 --> 02:46:01.919 region:rollup2
F. DOLLARS I KNOW YOU SOME OF

02:45:59.817 --> 02:46:02.653 region:rollup2
THAT. FOR FOR SOLVING SOME OF

02:46:01.919 --> 02:46:04.888 region:rollup2
THIS PROBLEM WE NEED TO

02:46:02.653 --> 02:46:06.290 region:rollup2
PRIORITIZE THAT OVER THE NEXT

02:46:04.888 --> 02:46:08.459 region:rollup2
FIVE TO TEN YEARS BECAUSE IF WE

02:46:06.290 --> 02:46:10.694 region:rollup2
DON'T DO THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO

02:46:08.459 --> 02:46:13.430 region:rollup2
ACHIEVE THE REDUCTIONS WE NEED.

02:46:10.694 --> 02:46:14.932 region:rollup2
AND THE SAME IS TRUE THERE ALSO

02:46:13.430 --> 02:46:16.633 region:rollup2
CAP AND TRADE DOLLARS PAID BY

02:46:14.932 --> 02:46:17.835 region:rollup2
THE UTILITIES THAT ARE CURRENTLY

02:46:16.633 --> 02:46:19.336 region:rollup2
RETURNED RATE PAYERS.

02:46:17.835 --> 02:46:20.904 region:rollup2
THAT'S ANOTHER POT OF MONEY THAT

02:46:19.336 --> 02:46:21.572 region:rollup2
CAN BE TAPPED TO HELP PAY FOR

02:46:20.904 --> 02:46:23.507 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE HARDENING OF THE

02:46:21.572 --> 02:46:25.476 region:rollup2
SYSTEM COSTS.

02:46:23.507 --> 02:46:27.077 region:rollup2
MOVING FORWARD SO IN CONCLUSION

02:46:25.476 --> 02:46:29.046 region:rollup2
WE LOOK FORWARD TO ROLLING UP

02:46:27.077 --> 02:46:30.581 region:rollup2
OUR SLEEVES WITH OTHERS TO FIND

02:46:29.046 --> 02:46:32.583 region:rollup2
A COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTION.

02:46:30.581 --> 02:46:34.017 region:rollup2
IT ISN'T PUTTING IT ALL ON PGA

02:46:32.583 --> 02:46:35.252 region:rollup2
NAY IT ISN'T PUTTING IT ALL ON

02:46:34.017 --> 02:46:36.820 region:rollup2
RATE PAYERS IT ISN'T PUTTING IT

02:46:35.252 --> 02:46:38.055 region:rollup2
ALL ON INSURERS.

02:46:36.820 --> 02:46:39.423 region:rollup2
BUT WERE WILLING I THINK ITS

02:46:38.055 --> 02:46:40.824 region:rollup2
RATEPAYERS TO COME TOGETHER WITH

02:46:39.423 --> 02:46:43.393 region:rollup2
THE REST OF THE A COMMITTEE AND

02:46:40.824 --> 02:46:45.529 region:rollup2
STAFF. TO FIND SOLUTIONS THAT

02:46:43.393 --> 02:46:47.698 region:rollup2
CAN WORK BUT IT CAN'T BE

02:46:45.529 --> 02:46:49.633 region:rollup2
RATEPAYERS LEFT HOLDING THE BAG.

02:46:47.698 --> 02:46:51.468 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

02:46:49.633 --> 02:46:53.504 region:rollup2

BECAUSE YOU REPRESENT THE RATE

02:46:57.474 --> 02:47:00.244 region:rollup2
PAYERS ARE PARTICULAR INTEREST

02:46:58.942 --> 02:47:02.546 region:rollup2
IN WHAT YOU HAVE TO STAY YOUR

02:47:00.244 --> 02:47:04.448 region:rollup2
PERSPECTIVE BECAUSE I'M

02:47:02.546 --> 02:47:06.049 region:rollup2
PARTICULARLY CONCERNED ABOUT

02:47:04.448 --> 02:47:06.650 region:rollup2
FACT INDIRECTLY RATE PERSONAL WE

02:47:06.049 --> 02:47:09.086 region:rollup2
DO.

02:47:06.650 --> 02:47:10.621 region:rollup2
SO -- I WANT

02:47:09.086 --> 02:47:12.589 region:rollup2
TO KIND OF PUT THINGS A LITTLE

02:47:10.621 --> 02:47:14.124 region:rollup2
BIT IN THE CONTEXT BECAUSE I

02:47:12.589 --> 02:47:15.926 region:rollup2
WANT TO JUST MENTION THE FACT

02:47:14.124 --> 02:47:17.160 region:rollup2
THAT THERE WAS.

02:47:15.926 --> 02:47:18.362 region:rollup2
ADJOURNMENT FOR THE HERE THAT

02:47:17.160 --> 02:47:20.063 region:rollup2
SPOKE THE FELT THAT CLIMATE

02:47:18.362 --> 02:47:22.065 region:rollup2
CHANGE.

02:47:20.063 --> 02:47:22.900 region:rollup2
WASN'T CAUSING MORE DAMAGE

02:47:22.065 --> 02:47:24.301 region:rollup2
DESPITE THE EVIDENCE THAT WE

02:47:22.900 --> 02:47:26.470 region:rollup2
HAVE.

02:47:24.301 --> 02:47:27.738 region:rollup2
MORE INTENSE FIRES WE HAVE.

02:47:26.470 --> 02:47:29.473 region:rollup2
I'M MORE INTO ITS INTENSE DAMAGE

02:47:27.738 --> 02:47:32.109 region:rollup2
WE HAVE AN INCIDENT IN SAN DIEGO

02:47:29.473 --> 02:47:33.477 region:rollup2
IN WHICH HE I MEAN YOU MENTION

02:47:32.109 --> 02:47:34.578 region:rollup2
AND EVERYBODY MENTIONS A NOBODY.

02:47:33.477 --> 02:47:37.281 region:rollup2
HERE.

02:47:34.578 --> 02:47:39.182 region:rollup2
WANTS TO ABSOLVE ANYBODY FOR

02:47:37.281 --> 02:47:40.784 region:rollup2
THEIR NET NEGLIGENCE THAT HAS

02:47:39.182 --> 02:47:42.653 region:rollup2
NEVER BEEN DISCUSSES NEVER BEEN

02:47:40.784 --> 02:47:44.187 region:rollup2
PROPOSED NOBODY HAS SAID WELL

02:47:42.653 --> 02:47:44.888 region:rollup2
LET'S LOOK AT HOW WE CAN.

02:47:44.187 --> 02:47:46.990 region:rollup2
HOLD --

02:47:44.888 --> 02:47:47.991 region:rollup2
UTILITIES LESS RESPONSIBLE FOR

02:47:46.990 --> 02:47:49.860 region:rollup2
THEM NOT MAKING THEIR

02:47:47.991 --> 02:47:50.794 region:rollup2
IMPROVEMENTS OR THE FAILURE OF

02:47:49.860 --> 02:47:52.296 region:rollup2
THEIR QUIT MEANT THAT THEY'RE

02:47:50.794 --> 02:47:53.297 region:rollup2
LIABLE FOR NOBODY HAS SAID THAT

02:47:52.296 --> 02:47:54.398 region:rollup2
NOBODY WANTS TO DO THAT.

02:47:53.297 --> 02:47:55.465 region:rollup2
THERE ISN'T A PROPOSAL ON THE

02:47:54.398 --> 02:47:57.668 region:rollup2
TABLE THAT DOES THAT.

02:47:55.465 --> 02:47:59.670 region:rollup2
LET'S PUT THAT ASIDE.

02:47:57.668 --> 02:48:00.237 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE DON'T I DON'T.

02:47:59.670 --> 02:48:01.438 region:rollup2
I DON'T THINK WE'RE GONNA DO

02:48:00.237 --> 02:48:03.307 region:rollup2
THAT.

02:48:01.438 --> 02:48:04.274 region:rollup2
AND IF THEY'RE RESPONSIBLE

02:48:03.307 --> 02:48:05.509 region:rollup2
THEY'RE GONNA PAY THEY AGREE

02:48:04.274 --> 02:48:06.176 region:rollup2
THEY WILL THEY'RE NOT LOOKING

02:48:05.509 --> 02:48:08.445 region:rollup2
FOR POLICIES THAT.

02:48:06.176 --> 02:48:11.148 region:rollup2
ABSOLVE THEM.

02:48:08.445 --> 02:48:15.052 region:rollup2
SO LET'S JUST TALK ABOUT.

02:48:11.148 --> 02:48:16.119 region:rollup2
I ADORED THE CONDITION IN WHICH

02:48:15.052 --> 02:48:17.154 region:rollup2
AS IN SAN DIEGO WE'VE BEEN

02:48:16.119 --> 02:48:18.155 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT SAN DIEGO ON THE

02:48:17.154 --> 02:48:20.123 region:rollup2
WAS A CONDITION WHICH SAN DIEGO

02:48:18.155 --> 02:48:20.691 region:rollup2
DID MAKE THE UPGRADES.

02:48:20.123 --> 02:48:22.559 region:rollup2
AND THEY DID MAINTAIN THEIR

02:48:20.691 --> 02:48:23.961 region:rollup2
QUITMAN THEY DID NOTHING WRONG

02:48:22.559 --> 02:48:25.329 region:rollup2
ENOUGH FRENCH CAME IN AND BLEW

02:48:23.961 --> 02:48:27.130 region:rollup2
ADELINE.

02:48:25.329 --> 02:48:29.633 region:rollup2
AND ANY TRIGGERED AN INVERSE

02:48:27.130 --> 02:48:31.535 region:rollup2
CONDEMNATION CAN CLAIM AND IT IT

02:48:29.633 --> 02:48:33.070 region:rollup2
RESULTED IN THIS DECISION WHICH

02:48:31.535 --> 02:48:34.404 region:rollup2
APPEARS HE SAID NO REPAIRS WILL

02:48:33.070 --> 02:48:36.606 region:rollup2
NOT PAY.

02:48:34.404 --> 02:48:39.242 region:rollup2
YOU WILL PAY FOR THIS.

02:48:36.606 --> 02:48:41.478 region:rollup2
THAT IS A DIRECT.

02:48:39.242 --> 02:48:43.080 region:rollup2
THAT IS A DIRECT RESULT OF IT

02:48:41.478 --> 02:48:44.514 region:rollup2
UNLESS YOU NEED BASICALLY ACTING

02:48:43.080 --> 02:48:45.449 region:rollup2
AS AN INSURANCE COMPANIES SAYING

02:48:44.514 --> 02:48:48.285 region:rollup2
OKAY WE'RE GONNA PAY THIS

02:48:45.449 --> 02:48:49.553 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THOSE DAMAGES WERE PAID

02:48:48.285 --> 02:48:51.488 region:rollup2
BY INSURANCE COMPANIES INSURANCE

02:48:49.553 --> 02:48:53.390 region:rollup2
COMPANY SUED.

02:48:51.488 --> 02:48:54.591 region:rollup2
S. THE GENIE AND THEY WORK ALL

02:48:53.390 --> 02:48:56.326 region:rollup2
THE FUNDS THAT THEY SUIT FOR

02:48:54.591 --> 02:48:58.362 region:rollup2
RECOVERY.

02:48:56.326 --> 02:49:00.831 region:rollup2
SO DO YOU BELIEVE OUR UTILITY

02:48:58.362 --> 02:49:02.899 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE AT AN INSURANCE.

02:49:00.831 --> 02:49:04.768 region:rollup2
ACT AS AN INSURANCE COMPANY. FOR

02:49:02.899 --> 02:49:06.203 region:rollup2
LOSSES IN THE STATE.

02:49:04.768 --> 02:49:08.271 region:rollup2
SENATOR AS I UNDERSTAND THE

02:49:06.203 --> 02:49:09.906 region:rollup2
QUESTION YEAR YOUR SUGGESTING

02:49:08.271 --> 02:49:11.842 region:rollup2
THAT TOM.

02:49:09.906 --> 02:49:13.644 region:rollup2
BUT SRI FLEW IN THAT WASN'T

02:49:11.842 --> 02:49:14.478 region:rollup2
WITHIN THAT RIGHT OF WAY.

02:49:13.644 --> 02:49:16.179 region:rollup2
THAT.

02:49:14.478 --> 02:49:17.948 region:rollup2
TOM FLEW INTO A LINE THAT

02:49:16.179 --> 02:49:18.882 region:rollup2
STARTED THE FIRE IT IS ONE OF

02:49:17.948 --> 02:49:20.150 region:rollup2
THAT'S NOT WHAT HAPPENED IN THE

02:49:18.882 --> 02:49:21.218 region:rollup2
ESTA JEANNIE CONTEXT WHAT

02:49:20.150 --> 02:49:22.986 region:rollup2
HAPPENED WAS TREES THAT THEY

02:49:21.218 --> 02:49:23.587 region:rollup2
WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR TRIMMING

02:49:22.986 --> 02:49:24.354 region:rollup2
THAT WERE RIGHT NEXT TO THEIR

02:49:23.587 --> 02:49:26.923 region:rollup2
LINES.

02:49:24.354 --> 02:49:28.291 region:rollup2
WERE NOT PACKED PROPERLY TRIMMED

02:49:26.923 --> 02:49:29.426 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S WHAT CAUSED THAT

02:49:28.291 --> 02:49:31.528 region:rollup2
WE'RE GETTING INTO THE DETAILS.

02:49:29.426 --> 02:49:32.829 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I CAN GET INTO THE

02:49:31.528 --> 02:49:34.731 region:rollup2
DETAILS OF THE CASE A LITTLE BIT

02:49:32.829 --> 02:49:35.365 region:rollup2
MORE KNOW THAT THEY WERE CUT IN

02:49:34.731 --> 02:49:37.134 region:rollup2
THE WAS A TREE THAT [inaudible]

02:49:35.365 --> 02:49:38.435 region:rollup2
WAS WILL.

02:49:37.134 --> 02:49:39.703 region:rollup2
FAR FROM THE LINES IT WAS

02:49:38.435 --> 02:49:42.072 region:rollup2
WEAKENED BECAUSE OF THAT CUTTING

02:49:39.703 --> 02:49:44.241 region:rollup2
AND GET SO I MEAN.

02:49:42.072 --> 02:49:47.244 region:rollup2
WE'RE GETTING INTO YOU KNOW THE

02:49:44.241 --> 02:49:49.780 region:rollup2
DETAILS BUT GENERALLY --

02:49:47.244 --> 02:49:50.681 region:rollup2
ASSUMING.

02:49:49.780 --> 02:49:51.982 region:rollup2
THAT IT WAS.

02:49:50.681 --> 02:49:52.482 region:rollup2
I MEAN WAIT IT'S HARDER TO

02:49:51.982 --> 02:49:52.783 region:rollup2
LITIGATE THIS FROM HERE

02:49:52.482 --> 02:49:57.054 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

02:49:52.783 --> 02:49:59.222 region:rollup2
BUT GENERALLY.

02:49:57.054 --> 02:50:00.624 region:rollup2
IF YOU THINK CURRENTLY IN THIS

02:49:59.222 --> 02:50:02.159 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENT THAT THAT'S OF THAT

02:50:00.624 --> 02:50:05.562 region:rollup2
THAT THEY SHOULD BE UTILITIES

02:50:02.159 --> 02:50:05.562 region:rollup2
ARE NOT ACTIVE ISSUES INSURANCE

02:50:05.629 --> 02:50:09.399 region:rollup2
NO MIGHT MY VIEW IS THAT TIME

02:50:07.898 --> 02:50:10.467 region:rollup2
WHEN UTILITIES ARE NEGLIGENT AND

02:50:09.399 --> 02:50:12.135 region:rollup2
WOOD YOU YOU ADDRESS THAT YOU

02:50:10.467 --> 02:50:13.737 region:rollup2
SAID THERE'S NO NO NO WORRY THAT

02:50:12.135 --> 02:50:15.205 region:rollup2
THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN I'VE I'VE I

02:50:13.737 --> 02:50:17.207 region:rollup2
I HOPE THAT THAT'S THE CASE.

02:50:15.205 --> 02:50:19.443 region:rollup2
I I HAVE SEEN BILLS WHAT IF

02:50:17.207 --> 02:50:20.577 region:rollup2
THEY'RE NOT NINETEEN EIGHTY

02:50:19.443 --> 02:50:21.611 region:rollup2
EIGHT IN S. B. THIRTY THREE FOR

02:50:20.577 --> 02:50:23.747 region:rollup2
A THIRD. EIGHT THIRTY THREE THAT

02:50:21.611 --> 02:50:25.582 region:rollup2
WOULD DO EXACTLY WHAT YOU SAY IS

02:50:23.747 --> 02:50:27.184 region:rollup2
NOT GOING TO HAPPEN BUT THAT

02:50:25.582 --> 02:50:29.453 region:rollup2
PUTTING THAT ASIDE.

02:50:27.184 --> 02:50:30.854 region:rollup2
TICKETS ARE CONCERNED THAT --

02:50:29.453 --> 02:50:32.189 region:rollup2
YOU RAISE I THINK IS THAT THE

02:50:30.854 --> 02:50:33.123 region:rollup2
UTILITIES WOULD BE HELD

02:50:32.189 --> 02:50:34.825 region:rollup2
SHAREHOLDERS WOULD BE HELD

02:50:33.123 --> 02:50:36.093 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBLE.

02:50:34.825 --> 02:50:37.594 region:rollup2
WHEN THEY'RE NOT NEGLIGENT AND

02:50:36.093 --> 02:50:38.695 region:rollup2
WE'RE NOT SUGGESTING THAT WE'RE

02:50:37.594 --> 02:50:40.597 region:rollup2
NOT SUGGESTING THAT THE YOU

02:50:38.695 --> 02:50:41.465 region:rollup2
PINCH THE UTILITY SHOULD BECOME

02:50:40.597 --> 02:50:42.699 region:rollup2
THE INSURERS OF LAST RESORTNOR

02:50:41.465 --> 02:50:44.935 region:rollup2
SHOULD REPAIRS BECAUSE I HAVE

02:50:42.699 --> 02:50:45.302 region:rollup2
THE WOMEN DECISION HERE AND THE

02:50:44.935 --> 02:50:46.203 region:rollup2
WE MET DECISION?

02:50:45.302 --> 02:50:48.672 region:rollup2
IN IT [inaudible]

02:50:46.203 --> 02:50:50.340 region:rollup2
BUT DENIED THAT REPAIRS SHOULD

02:50:48.672 --> 02:50:52.075 region:rollup2
BE HELD RESPONSIBLE OTHER WORDS

02:50:50.340 --> 02:50:53.777 region:rollup2
UP UPHELD THAT REPAIRS SHOULD

02:50:52.075 --> 02:50:55.345 region:rollup2
NOT BE RESPONSIBLE.

02:50:53.777 --> 02:50:56.313 region:rollup2
AND THAT SHAREHOLDERS SHOULD PAY

02:50:55.345 --> 02:50:58.415 region:rollup2
THOSE DAMAGES.

02:50:56.313 --> 02:50:59.483 region:rollup2
BUT ALSO IN THE SAME DECISION

02:50:58.415 --> 02:51:01.952 region:rollup2
THEY SAID THAT THE LEGISLATURE

02:50:59.483 --> 02:51:04.121 region:rollup2
NEEDS TO DO SOMETHING. TO

02:51:01.952 --> 02:51:06.456 region:rollup2
ADDRESS THE SITUATION THAT PUTS

02:51:04.121 --> 02:51:07.491 region:rollup2
YOU SEE IN THE POSITION TO HAVE

02:51:06.456 --> 02:51:07.791 region:rollup2
TO MAKE THAT DECISION

02:51:07.491 --> 02:51:11.061 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

02:51:07.791 --> 02:51:12.963 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT'S IT'S IT'S INHERENT

02:51:11.061 --> 02:51:14.531 region:rollup2
IN OUR EITHER LAW OR IN THEIR

02:51:12.963 --> 02:51:15.398 region:rollup2
OPINION THAT IT NEEDS

02:51:14.531 --> 02:51:16.800 region:rollup2
LEGISLATIVE ACTION FOR THAT NOT

02:51:15.398 --> 02:51:18.835 region:rollup2
HAPPEN SO.

02:51:16.800 --> 02:51:19.803 region:rollup2
YOUR ANSWER IS YOU DON'T BELIEVE

02:51:18.835 --> 02:51:21.772 region:rollup2
THEY SHOULD ACT AS INSURANCE

02:51:19.803 --> 02:51:23.273 region:rollup2
COMPANIES AS A P. YOU SEE FEELS

02:51:21.772 --> 02:51:24.875 region:rollup2
THAT THEY ARE UP WHY DON'T AGREE

02:51:23.273 --> 02:51:26.409 region:rollup2
THAT THAT'S THE P. UC'S VIEW BUT

02:51:24.875 --> 02:51:27.878 region:rollup2
I DO AGREE THAT I DO AGREE WITH

02:51:26.409 --> 02:51:29.079 region:rollup2
YOU THAT IT'S IN THE DOCUMENT

02:51:27.878 --> 02:51:32.182 region:rollup2
IT'S AT THAT IN THE REPORT.

02:51:29.079 --> 02:51:32.782 region:rollup2
BUT I REQUEST AS I READ.

02:51:32.182 --> 02:51:35.051 region:rollup2
FOUND IS THAT THE THE COMPANY

02:51:32.782 --> 02:51:36.853 region:rollup2
FAILED TO COMPLY WITH PRUDENT

02:51:35.051 --> 02:51:38.522 region:rollup2
MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AND AS A

02:51:36.853 --> 02:51:40.524 region:rollup2
RESULT IT WAS IMPRUDENT AND THAT

02:51:38.522 --> 02:51:41.658 region:rollup2
RATEPAYERS.

02:51:40.524 --> 02:51:42.692 region:rollup2
SHOULD NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR

COMMISSION HAS IN FACT A PORTION

02:52:14.925 --> 02:52:18.195 region:rollup2
FOR FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY

02:52:16.393 --> 02:52:18.828 region:rollup2

INCIDENTS TAKE PLACE AND THAT

02:52:57.634 --> 02:53:00.904 region:rollup2

CLIMATE CHNGE IS PUT IN THE

02:53:15.018 --> 02:53:19.122 region:rollup2
EXTRA BURDEN ON THE WAY WE AND

02:53:17.187 --> 02:53:19.322 region:rollup2
YOU ENGINEER OUR OUR ELECTRICAL

02:53:19.122 --> 02:53:21.391 region:rollup2

CLIMATE CHANGE I THINK WE NEED

02:53:25.929 --> 02:53:28.565 region:rollup2
TO LOOK AT WHAT THE UTILITIES

02:53:26.830 --> 02:53:30.233 region:rollup2

THE PROBLEMS DO YOU BELIEVE

02:53:33.503 --> 02:53:36.773 region:rollup2
REPAIR SHOULD PAY FOR THAT.

02:53:35.071 --> 02:53:38.441 region:rollup2

ARGUED?

02:53:41.344 --> 02:53:43.546 region:rollup2
THAT THOSE UPGRADE SHOULD BE

02:53:41.912 --> 02:53:44.481 region:rollup2
MADE.

02:53:43.546 --> 02:53:48.652 region:rollup2

IN WHICH IF YOU SEE HAS NOT.

02:53:48.652 --> 02:53:51.321 region:rollup2
ALLOWED THOSE UPGRADES BECAUSE

02:53:49.486 --> 02:53:53.323 region:rollup2
OF THE PASSING OF THE CONCERN OF

YOU COULD USE THEM ANYWAY AS AN

02:54:34.698 --> 02:54:37.467 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE OF THE POINT I WAS

02:54:36.166 --> 02:54:39.369 region:rollup2
GETTING TO IS THAT.

02:54:37.467 --> 02:54:41.004 region:rollup2

IS GOOD ENOUGH OF SUSPECTS

02:55:56.479 --> 02:56:00.116 region:rollup2
SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE IS NOT

02:55:58.281 --> 02:56:01.151 region:rollup2
GOOD ENOUGH WHAT SHOULD THE

02:56:00.116 --> 02:56:02.719 region:rollup2
STANDARD BE?

02:56:01.151 --> 02:56:03.853 region:rollup2
THE STANDARD SHOULD BE WHAT

02:56:02.719 --> 02:56:05.155 region:rollup2
WOULD A PRUDENT MANAGER DO IN

02:56:03.853 --> 02:56:06.456 region:rollup2
THE SITUATION GIVEN THE FACTS

02:56:05.155 --> 02:56:07.957 region:rollup2
NOT THE TIME AND THAT'S THE P.

02:56:06.456 --> 02:56:09.692 region:rollup2
YOU SEE STANDARD THAT IT APPLIED

02:56:07.957 --> 02:56:10.627 region:rollup2

02:56:10.627 --> 02:56:13.229 region:rollup2
STATE PUBLIC UTILITIES

02:56:11.861 --> 02:56:13.830 region:rollup2
COMMISSIONS AROUND THE COUNTRY

02:56:13.229 --> 02:56:16.366 region:rollup2
FOR SINCE THE TURN OF THE LAST

02:56:13.830 --> 02:56:19.969 region:rollup2
CENTURY BUT I I WOULD MAKE THE

02:56:16.366 --> 02:56:21.971 region:rollup2
ARGUMENT THAT'S SEMANTICS BUT

02:56:19.969 --> 02:56:23.640 region:rollup2
THAT YOUR POINT --

02:56:21.971 --> 02:56:24.274 region:rollup2
THE CONCERN ABOUT S. B..

02:56:23.640 --> 02:56:26.009 region:rollup2
TEN EIGHTY EIGHT SIR IS THAT IS

02:56:24.274 --> 02:56:27.010 region:rollup2
THAT THE UTILITIES TRAFFIC PLAN

02:56:26.009 --> 02:56:28.144 region:rollup2
AND THERE'S A VERY RUSHED

02:56:27.010 --> 02:56:29.345 region:rollup2
PROCESS FOR THE PLANNED TO BE

02:56:28.144 --> 02:56:29.913 region:rollup2
APPROVED.

02:56:29.345 --> 02:56:32.182 region:rollup2
AND AND THEN THE PROBLEM IS

02:56:29.913 --> 02:56:33.316 region:rollup2
THAT.

02:56:32.182 --> 02:56:35.251 region:rollup2
UTILITIES CAN SAY WE

02:56:33.316 --> 02:56:36.920 region:rollup2
SUBSTANTIALLY WHAT WE DID WE

02:56:35.251 --> 02:56:38.021 region:rollup2
KIND OF WEEK WEEKS WE COMPLY

02:56:36.920 --> 02:56:39.622 region:rollup2
WITH A LOT OF IT BUT WE DIDN'T

02:56:38.021 --> 02:56:41.257 region:rollup2
DO AT ALL AND SO THEREFORE.

02:56:39.622 --> 02:56:44.961 region:rollup2
WOULD INTRANET TREE.

02:56:41.257 --> 02:56:47.530 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW OF THAT WAS THAT.

02:56:44.961 --> 02:56:48.731 region:rollup2
TRUE MOST OF THEM.

02:56:47.530 --> 02:56:49.933 region:rollup2
AND AND THAT'S THAT THAT'S A

02:56:48.731 --> 02:56:51.101 region:rollup2
GOOD LOOK AT ME LOOK AT WHAT I

02:56:49.933 --> 02:56:53.336 region:rollup2
CAN GET INTO SPECIFICS BUT IF

02:56:51.101 --> 02:56:55.338 region:rollup2
NAY IF THERE'S NEGLIGENCE --

02:56:53.336 --> 02:56:57.674 region:rollup2
THE UTILITY PAYS.

02:56:55.338 --> 02:56:58.708 region:rollup2
YEAH WE CANNOT GET DOWN TO THE

02:56:57.674 --> 02:56:59.909 region:rollup2
MICRO.

02:56:58.708 --> 02:57:02.745 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW --

02:56:59.909 --> 02:57:03.880 region:rollup2
PORTIONS OF ALL THESE --

02:57:02.745 --> 02:57:05.782 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW.

02:57:03.880 --> 02:57:07.083 region:rollup2
RURAL AREAS ON WHAT HAPPENS WITH

02:57:05.782 --> 02:57:09.152 region:rollup2
THIS TREE IN THAT TREE THAT'S A

02:57:07.083 --> 02:57:10.620 region:rollup2
CPU SEES RESPONSIBILITY.

02:57:09.152 --> 02:57:12.489 region:rollup2
AND AND I WOULD ARGUE WITH YOU

02:57:10.620 --> 02:57:14.190 region:rollup2
ALSO THAT --

02:57:12.489 --> 02:57:15.692 region:rollup2
IT HAVING IT --

02:57:14.190 --> 02:57:17.527 region:rollup2
NOT INVOLVED IN THE GENERAL CASE

02:57:15.692 --> 02:57:18.862 region:rollup2
RATE CASE.

02:57:17.527 --> 02:57:20.864 region:rollup2
IS A BETTER WAY.

02:57:18.862 --> 02:57:22.532 region:rollup2
OF GETTING TO SAFETY AND I GET

02:57:20.864 --> 02:57:24.868 region:rollup2
THE FACT THAT I APPRECIATE BOTH

02:57:22.532 --> 02:57:27.003 region:rollup2
OF YOU ALL OF YOU FOR BEING

02:57:24.868 --> 02:57:28.171 region:rollup2
PIERCE ADVOCATES FOR RATEPAYERS

02:57:27.003 --> 02:57:29.873 region:rollup2
I THINK WERE ALL.

02:57:28.171 --> 02:57:31.875 region:rollup2
FIERCE ADVOCATE FOR REPAIRS TO

02:57:29.873 --> 02:57:34.911 region:rollup2
PSYCH I I REALLY COMMEND YOU AND

02:57:31.875 --> 02:57:36.212 region:rollup2
THANK YOU BUT HERE'S THE DEAL.

02:57:34.911 --> 02:57:37.480 region:rollup2
YOU GET IN A GENERAL RATE CASE

02:57:36.212 --> 02:57:38.715 region:rollup2
NOBODY'S REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT

02:57:37.480 --> 02:57:39.983 region:rollup2
SAFETY AT THE END OF THE DAY

02:57:38.715 --> 02:57:41.317 region:rollup2
THEY'RE JUST TRYING TO FIND I

02:57:39.983 --> 02:57:44.220 region:rollup2
SHOULD SAY THAT LIKE THAT LET ME

02:57:41.317 --> 02:57:46.990 region:rollup2
LET ME BACK OFF THAT NOBODY.

02:57:44.220 --> 02:57:49.425 region:rollup2
IT TENDS TO TO GET TO THE POINT

02:57:46.990 --> 02:57:51.794 region:rollup2
WHERE THE FOCUS.

02:57:49.425 --> 02:57:53.096 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT ON SAFETY SO WHEN YOU

02:57:51.794 --> 02:57:57.534 region:rollup2
HAVE A GENERAL WHEN WHEN YOU

02:57:53.096 --> 02:57:58.801 region:rollup2
HAVE A A SEPARATE RATE CASE FOR

02:57:57.534 --> 02:58:00.436 region:rollup2
SAFETY ONLY [inaudible]

02:57:58.801 --> 02:58:02.205 region:rollup2
WHICH IS.

02:58:00.436 --> 02:58:04.174 region:rollup2
UP PART OF THE TEN EIGHTY EIGHT

02:58:02.205 --> 02:58:06.809 region:rollup2
BILL THERE'S MORE TIME AND

02:58:04.174 --> 02:58:08.645 region:rollup2
ATTENTION PAID TO SAFETY.

02:58:06.809 --> 02:58:10.547 region:rollup2
AND THE EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH

02:58:08.645 --> 02:58:14.150 region:rollup2
SAFETY AND GIVES YOU ALL THE

02:58:10.547 --> 02:58:15.385 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY. TO OPINE ON WHAT IS

02:58:14.150 --> 02:58:18.288 region:rollup2
GOOD WITH THAT AND WHAT IS BAD

02:58:15.385 --> 02:58:20.857 region:rollup2
AS OPPOSED. TO THE LATTER WHICH

02:58:18.288 --> 02:58:22.892 region:rollup2
IS EVERYTHING THROWN IN --

02:58:20.857 --> 02:58:23.893 region:rollup2
BUT THE KITCHEN SINK AND LORD

02:58:22.892 --> 02:58:25.795 region:rollup2
KNOWS WHAT'S THE YOU KNOW WHAT

02:58:23.893 --> 02:58:27.964 region:rollup2
HAPPENS IN A MINUTE TO LET YOU

02:58:25.795 --> 02:58:30.733 region:rollup2
TALK OF JUST WILL. ONE SECOND

02:58:27.964 --> 02:58:32.902 region:rollup2
THE FINISHED BY SAYING.

02:58:30.733 --> 02:58:35.271 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT CPC HAS GOT A

02:58:32.902 --> 02:58:38.007 region:rollup2
HORRIBLE JOB.

02:58:35.271 --> 02:58:39.309 region:rollup2
ON SAFETY AND OVER IN REGULATING

02:58:38.007 --> 02:58:40.643 region:rollup2
SAFETY IN THE STATE OF

02:58:39.309 --> 02:58:42.045 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

02:58:40.643 --> 02:58:43.479 region:rollup2
IT WE BLAME P. JEANNIE AND THEY

02:58:42.045 --> 02:58:46.182 region:rollup2
DESERVE A LOT OF BLAME BUT THE

02:58:43.479 --> 02:58:48.351 region:rollup2
CPUC OVERSIGHT OF P. JEANNIE IT

02:58:46.182 --> 02:58:49.719 region:rollup2
EVERY SINGLE INVESTOR OWNED

02:58:48.351 --> 02:58:50.954 region:rollup2
UTILITY IS LACKS.

02:58:49.719 --> 02:58:52.355 region:rollup2
THEY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH PEOPLE WE

02:58:50.954 --> 02:58:54.123 region:rollup2
HEARD IT THE OTHER DAY THEY SAID

02:58:52.355 --> 02:58:55.225 region:rollup2
SO DAMN MUCH BUT THE SAID SO

02:58:54.123 --> 02:58:56.259 region:rollup2
LITTLE.

02:58:55.225 --> 02:58:58.261 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S WHAT I PICKED UP FROM

02:58:56.259 --> 02:58:59.262 region:rollup2
DAMAGE TO YOUR POINT I AND I'M

02:58:58.261 --> 02:59:00.296 region:rollup2
NOT GONNA AND CERTAINLY NOT

02:58:59.262 --> 02:59:01.998 region:rollup2
GOING TO DISAGREE WITH YOU

02:59:00.296 --> 02:59:04.634 region:rollup2
CENTER DOT ON ON THAT POINT

02:59:01.998 --> 02:59:06.436 region:rollup2
ABOUT EXPEDITING THIS PROCESS --

02:59:04.634 --> 02:59:08.438 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WHEN THERE IS A SAFETY

02:59:06.436 --> 02:59:09.305 region:rollup2
SITUATION I GUARANTEE SAFETY

02:59:08.438 --> 02:59:10.473 region:rollup2
WILL BE FRONT AND CENTER

02:59:09.305 --> 02:59:12.675 region:rollup2
IMPEACHING THESE NEXT SEVERAL

02:59:10.473 --> 02:59:14.077 region:rollup2
RATE CASE WHETHER WE SEPARATED

02:59:12.675 --> 02:59:15.979 region:rollup2
ARE NOT THE SAME HAPPENED WITH

02:59:14.077 --> 02:59:18.014 region:rollup2
P. GINNY'S GENERATE CASE RIGHT

02:59:15.979 --> 02:59:21.718 region:rollup2
AFTER -- THE

02:59:18.014 --> 02:59:24.287 region:rollup2
SAME BRUNO INCIDENT THAT.

02:59:21.718 --> 02:59:26.289 region:rollup2
ENTIRELY ON SAFETY WE SOUGHT

02:59:24.287 --> 02:59:27.890 region:rollup2
WITH LISA CANYON AND IN SO CAL

02:59:26.289 --> 02:59:29.592 region:rollup2
GASES RATE CASE FOLLOWING LISA

02:59:27.890 --> 02:59:30.093 region:rollup2
CANYON THEY'RE ASKING FOR A

02:59:29.592 --> 02:59:31.060 region:rollup2
MASSIVE RATE INCREASE TO

02:59:30.093 --> 02:59:33.329 region:rollup2
ADDRESS.

02:59:31.060 --> 02:59:35.431 region:rollup2
SAFETY FOR LISA CANYON SO IT

02:59:33.329 --> 02:59:36.499 region:rollup2
DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY CAN WE

02:59:35.431 --> 02:59:38.001 region:rollup2
IMPROVE IT SURE.

02:59:36.499 --> 02:59:40.470 region:rollup2
AND CAN WE WORK WITH YOU TO FIND

02:59:38.001 --> 02:59:42.105 region:rollup2
A YOU KNOW A WAY TO DO THAT SURE

02:59:40.470 --> 02:59:43.406 region:rollup2
ABSOLUTELY WE CAN YOU KNOW WE

02:59:42.105 --> 02:59:44.607 region:rollup2
CAN IMPROVE ON THE PROCESS AT

02:59:43.406 --> 02:59:46.609 region:rollup2
THE CPUC.

02:59:44.607 --> 02:59:48.111 region:rollup2
THIS STUFF DOES NEED TO GET DONE

02:59:46.609 --> 02:59:50.113 region:rollup2
BUT WE ALSO NEED TO MAKE SURE

02:59:48.111 --> 02:59:51.814 region:rollup2
THERE IS A PERVERSEINCENTIVE

02:59:50.113 --> 02:59:52.315 region:rollup2
FOR UTILITIES TO OVERSPEND

02:59:51.814 --> 02:59:54.050 region:rollup2
PARTICULARLY ON CAPITAL

02:59:52.315 --> 02:59:55.485 region:rollup2
PROJECTS.

02:59:54.050 --> 02:59:57.654 region:rollup2
THE MORE THEY SPEND THE MORE

02:59:55.485 --> 03:00:00.123 region:rollup2
SHAREHOLDERS MAKE AND WE HAVE TO

02:59:57.654 --> 03:00:02.158 region:rollup2
ADDRESS THAT INVERSE.

03:00:00.123 --> 03:00:04.827 region:rollup2
AGREE PURSE BUT IT'S JUST IT

03:00:02.158 --> 03:00:06.229 region:rollup2
INVERSE I'M SORRY PERVERSE.

03:00:04.827 --> 03:00:07.864 region:rollup2
I'VE SAID IN VERSE SO MANY TIMES

03:00:06.229 --> 03:00:10.366 region:rollup2
IN THE LAST FEW EXCEPT PERVERSE

03:00:07.864 --> 03:00:12.201 region:rollup2
INCENTIVE TO OVERSPEND SO THAT

03:00:10.366 --> 03:00:14.504 region:rollup2
IS WHY I THINK IT'S RATE PAYERS

03:00:12.201 --> 03:00:16.172 region:rollup2
WE INSIST ON HAVING A PROCESS.

03:00:14.504 --> 03:00:17.607 region:rollup2
TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE THE TIME TO

03:00:16.172 --> 03:00:18.541 region:rollup2
LOOK THROUGH THAT WERE OUT ROUTE

03:00:17.607 --> 03:00:20.176 region:rollup2
NUMBER.

03:00:18.541 --> 03:00:21.878 region:rollup2
I CAN GET ON A CALL ON A RATE

03:00:20.176 --> 03:00:23.680 region:rollup2
CASE WITH PGA NAY WITHOUT YOU

03:00:21.878 --> 03:00:25.048 region:rollup2
KNOW ME AND EIGHT OF THEIR

03:00:23.680 --> 03:00:26.649 region:rollup2
ATTORNEYS ON THE OTHER.

03:00:25.048 --> 03:00:28.384 region:rollup2
END OF THE PHONE BECAUSE THEY'RE

03:00:26.649 --> 03:00:29.919 region:rollup2
JUST THEY LAWYER UP AND THEY'RE

03:00:28.384 --> 03:00:30.953 region:rollup2
THEY'RE JUST MUCH MORE PREPARED.

03:00:29.919 --> 03:00:32.588 region:rollup2
SO WE'RE ALWAYS AT A

03:00:30.953 --> 03:00:33.890 region:rollup2
DISADVANTAGE IS RATEPAYERS IN

03:00:32.588 --> 03:00:35.725 region:rollup2
THAT PROCEEDING SO WE'RE JUST

03:00:33.890 --> 03:00:37.193 region:rollup2
LOOKING FOR AN OPPORTUNITY TO

03:00:35.725 --> 03:00:38.895 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE THAT THIS STUFF.

03:00:37.193 --> 03:00:40.530 region:rollup2
IS PRUDENT IS NECESSARY AND

03:00:38.895 --> 03:00:42.265 region:rollup2
ISN'T JUST YOU KNOW THE

03:00:40.530 --> 03:00:44.434 region:rollup2
UTILITIES PATTING SHAREHOLDER

03:00:42.265 --> 03:00:45.968 region:rollup2
PROFITS AND SO THERE'S A WAITED

03:00:44.434 --> 03:00:46.836 region:rollup2
TO FIGURE THAT OUT WITH YOU AND

03:00:45.968 --> 03:00:48.237 region:rollup2
WE LOOK FORWARD TO THAT

MISTER CHAIRMAN IF I'M IF I

MS FROM MR BROKEN DORIS SAID

03:00:52.608 --> 03:00:54.110 region:rollup2
REGARDING --

03:00:53.142 --> 03:00:55.244 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THE FACT THAT I THINK

03:00:54.110 --> 03:00:56.846 region:rollup2
IT'S DIFFICULT TO IMAGINE A

03:00:55.244 --> 03:00:58.347 region:rollup2
SCENARIO WHICH SAFETY IS NOT

03:00:56.846 --> 03:00:58.948 region:rollup2
FRONT AND CENTER.

03:00:58.347 --> 03:00:59.782 region:rollup2
IN ALL THE UPCOMING GENERATE

03:00:58.948 --> 03:01:02.285 region:rollup2

REGARDING DOESN'T THAT YOU

03:01:05.988 --> 03:01:09.125 region:rollup2
CLIMATE CHANGE IN THE IMPACT

03:01:07.323 --> 03:01:11.260 region:rollup2
HERE I THINK WE CAN'T THAT STATE

03:01:09.125 --> 03:01:13.262 region:rollup2
THIS DIFFICULT TO DENY --

03:01:11.260 --> 03:01:14.831 region:rollup2
YET THE THAT'S WHY I THINK THERE

03:01:13.262 --> 03:01:16.833 region:rollup2
ISSUES SUCH AS THE STATE

03:01:14.831 --> 03:01:18.634 region:rollup2

03:01:29.345 --> 03:01:33.983 region:rollup2
INTEREST IN THE FORESTRY

03:01:31.481 --> 03:01:35.651 region:rollup2
POLICIES THAT HAVE CONTRIBUTED

03:01:33.983 --> 03:01:37.320 region:rollup2
TO THE SITUATION THAT WE'RE IN

03:01:35.651 --> 03:01:38.354 region:rollup2
THERE IS A STATE INTEREST IN

OUR THE LIVES OF THE CITIZENS OF

03:01:39.288 --> 03:01:43.960 region:rollup2
THE STATE I THINK THERE IS THAT

03:01:41.924 --> 03:01:45.395 region:rollup2
NEXUS THERE AND IT YOU KNOW THE

03:01:43.960 --> 03:01:47.597 region:rollup2
NEW NORMAL YOU KNOW CERTAINLY

HOW THOSE RESOURCES HAVE BEEN

03:01:49.365 --> 03:01:51.968 region:rollup2
INVESTED TODAY.

03:01:50.333 --> 03:01:53.669 region:rollup2
