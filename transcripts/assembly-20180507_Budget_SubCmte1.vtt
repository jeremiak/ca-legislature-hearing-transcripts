01:40:21.415 --> 01:40:23.684 region:rollup2
MAY BE ABLE TO BE FUNDED

01:40:21.916 --> 01:40:25.453 region:rollup2
THROUGH.

01:40:23.684 --> 01:40:27.288 region:rollup2
AFFILIATION WITH SOME OF THE A

01:40:25.453 --> 01:40:28.389 region:rollup2
LARGE HEALTH SYSTEM IN THE

01:40:27.288 --> 01:40:29.624 region:rollup2
FRESNO AREA THAT IS VERY

01:40:28.389 --> 01:40:30.892 region:rollup2
INTERESTED IN A LONG TERM

01:40:29.624 --> 01:40:32.460 region:rollup2

WITH THE DISTRICT OPERA

01:40:32.460 --> 01:40:36.898 region:rollup2
OPERATIONS THE PROBLEM WITH THAT

01:40:34.629 --> 01:40:38.165 region:rollup2
IS THAT IT'S HUNG UP RIGHT NOW.

01:40:36.898 --> 01:40:39.600 region:rollup2
IN THE BANKRUPTCY WHERE THE

01:40:38.165 --> 01:40:41.469 region:rollup2
PRIOR MANAGEMENT COMPANY HAS

01:40:39.600 --> 01:40:43.304 region:rollup2
PLACED A LIEN ON SOME OF THE

01:40:41.469 --> 01:40:45.439 region:rollup2

USE AS COLLATERAL FOR THAT LOAN.

01:40:45.439 --> 01:40:48.543 region:rollup2
AND.

01:40:46.741 --> 01:40:49.543 region:rollup2
WE BELIEVE THAT LEAN RELEASED

01:40:48.543 --> 01:40:51.512 region:rollup2
OUR ATTORNEYS BELIEVE THAT THAT

01:40:49.543 --> 01:40:53.314 region:rollup2
LEAN IS NOT VALID BUT IT WILL

01:40:51.512 --> 01:40:54.482 region:rollup2
TAKE QUITE AWHILE. TO WORK THAT

01:40:53.314 --> 01:40:56.250 region:rollup2
THROUGH THE COURTS.

01:40:54.482 --> 01:40:57.552 region:rollup2
IN EFFORT TO GET TO BE ABLE TO

ACCESS SOME OF THOSE FUNDS.

01:40:57.552 --> 01:41:00.655 region:rollup2
IN DOING THAT.

01:40:58.920 --> 01:41:01.989 region:rollup2
OF THE.

01:41:00.655 --> 01:41:03.624 region:rollup2
THEY HOW THE OTHER ISSUE IS WE

01:41:01.989 --> 01:41:04.358 region:rollup2
ALSO AT FROM A FINANCING

01:41:03.624 --> 01:41:06.627 region:rollup2
PERSPECTIVE.

01:51:59.746 --> 01:52:03.984 region:rollup2
THEY RAN SHORT.

01:52:01.481 --> 01:52:05.619 region:rollup2

.

01:52:11.925 --> 01:52:15.762 region:rollup2
THEY SAID IF WE DON'T HAVE THAT

01:52:13.460 --> 01:52:17.965 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU FINISHED THE. THE THE

01:52:15.762 --> 01:52:19.766 region:rollup2
THE EXPANSION BECAUSE IT WAS WAS

01:52:17.965 --> 01:52:22.135 region:rollup2
RAN SHORT OF MONEY.

01:52:19.766 --> 01:52:23.503 region:rollup2
BUT REALLY WHAT WE THINK WAS

01:52:22.135 --> 01:52:24.838 region:rollup2
DONE WITHOUT LOOKING AT THE

01:52:23.503 --> 01:52:27.040 region:rollup2
FINANCES AND RICH CAN SPEAK TO

01:52:24.838 --> 01:52:29.276 region:rollup2
THIS WAS IT WAS REALLY JUST TO

01:52:27.040 --> 01:52:30.978 region:rollup2
COVER. THE LOSSES AND PROBABLY

01:52:29.276 --> 01:52:32.412 region:rollup2
SO SHUFFLE MORE MONEY INTO THEIR

01:52:30.978 --> 01:52:34.548 region:rollup2
POCKETS.

01:52:32.412 --> 01:52:36.450 region:rollup2
AND SO ALREADY SEEING THEIR

01:52:34.548 --> 01:52:38.719 region:rollup2
THEIR GAME PLAN THAT'S WHY THE

01:52:36.450 --> 01:52:40.520 region:rollup2
CITIZEN GROUP BUT WE WE FORMED

01:52:38.719 --> 01:52:42.055 region:rollup2
TO DEFEAT THAT BOND BECAUSE WE

01:52:40.520 --> 01:52:44.091 region:rollup2
KNEW IF IT PASSED.

01:52:42.055 --> 01:52:46.159 region:rollup2
BUT THAT HOSPITAL ALL THE MONEY

01:52:44.091 --> 01:52:47.694 region:rollup2
WOULD GO DOWN THE DRAIN AND WE'D

01:52:46.159 --> 01:52:48.862 region:rollup2
END UP WITH A BIGGER HOLE. AND

01:52:47.694 --> 01:52:51.898 region:rollup2
PROBABLY NEVER HOPE IN THE

01:52:48.862 --> 01:52:53.367 region:rollup2
HOSPITAL AGAIN SO WE SAW IT AS

01:52:51.898 --> 01:52:55.936 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO KEEP THE BOND. AND

01:52:53.367 --> 01:52:57.804 region:rollup2
MATTER OF FACT WE HAD A SLOGAN.

01:52:55.936 --> 01:52:59.339 region:rollup2
THE VOTE NO ON MEASURE AYE AND

01:52:57.804 --> 01:53:00.907 region:rollup2
SAVE OUR PUBLIC HOSPITAL ON AND

01:52:59.339 --> 01:53:01.875 region:rollup2
THEY HAD VOTE YES.

01:53:00.907 --> 01:53:03.377 region:rollup2
MY MEASURE AYE AND SAVE THE

01:53:01.875 --> 01:53:05.946 region:rollup2
HOSPITAL.

01:53:03.377 --> 01:53:06.813 region:rollup2
AND WE BELIEVE WE WERE RIGHT IN.

01:53:05.946 --> 01:53:08.782 region:rollup2
SINCE IT'S THE BIGGEST

01:53:06.813 --> 01:53:10.317 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATION INTO LARRY COUNTY

01:53:08.782 --> 01:53:12.019 region:rollup2
HISTORY I THINK THAT PROVES OUR

01:53:10.317 --> 01:53:13.820 region:rollup2
CITIZEN GROUP WAS RIGHT TO

01:53:12.019 --> 01:53:14.888 region:rollup2
DEFEAT THAT BOND. IT INTO

01:53:13.820 --> 01:53:17.758 region:rollup2
FURTHER ANSWER YOUR QUESTION I

01:53:14.888 --> 01:53:19.192 region:rollup2
THAT BOND WAS PROPOSED TO FINISH

01:53:17.758 --> 01:53:21.361 region:rollup2
AN EXPANSION.

01:53:19.192 --> 01:53:22.629 region:rollup2
OF THAT THE PRIOR MANAGEMENT WAS

01:53:21.361 --> 01:53:24.998 region:rollup2
PLANNING THEY ACTUALLY HAVE A

01:53:22.629 --> 01:53:25.866 region:rollup2
TOWER THAT'S PARTLY CONSTRUCTED

01:53:24.998 --> 01:53:28.201 region:rollup2

01:53:25.866 --> 01:53:30.671 region:rollup2
INITIAL BOND ISSUE. THAT IS BY

FOUR WE WERE LOSING A YOUNG

02:01:07.260 --> 02:01:13.299 region:rollup2
PERSON TO DRINKING AND DRIVING.

02:01:10.163 --> 02:01:15.368 region:rollup2
INCIDENTS EVERY FIFTEEN MINUTES.

02:01:13.299 --> 02:01:17.804 region:rollup2
IN THE TIME SINCE THEN WE'VE

02:01:15.368 --> 02:01:19.172 region:rollup2
BEEN ABLE TO REDUCE THAT DOWN TO

02:01:17.804 --> 02:01:21.407 region:rollup2
ONE YOUNG PERSON EVERY FORTY

02:01:19.172 --> 02:01:23.109 region:rollup2
FIVE MINUTES.

02:01:21.407 --> 02:01:25.011 region:rollup2
SO IN THE TIME THAT THIS SESSION

02:01:23.109 --> 02:01:26.379 region:rollup2
HAS BEEN GOING ON WE'VE HAD

02:01:25.011 --> 02:01:27.947 region:rollup2
THREE YOUNG PEOPLE THAT HAVE

02:01:26.379 --> 02:01:29.249 region:rollup2
BEEN INTO AN EMERGENCY ROOM.

02:01:27.947 --> 02:01:30.049 region:rollup2
OR HAVE DIED BECAUSE OF THE

02:01:29.249 --> 02:01:32.152 region:rollup2
COMBINATION OF ALCOHOL AND

WE'RE PLEASED WITH THIS IS AN

02:01:33.419 --> 02:01:37.323 region:rollup2
ISSUE THAT IS ONE HUNDRED

02:01:35.221 --> 02:01:38.258 region:rollup2
PERCENT PREVENTABLE.

02:01:37.323 --> 02:01:40.059 region:rollup2
AND THE ONLY WAY IT'S

02:01:38.258 --> 02:01:41.461 region:rollup2
PREVENTABLE WE BELIEVE IS BY

02:01:40.059 --> 02:01:43.163 region:rollup2
ENGAGING YOUNG PEOPLE IN FINDING

02:01:41.461 --> 02:01:44.998 region:rollup2

SO THE KEY TO THE FRIDAY NIGHT

02:01:44.998 --> 02:01:48.668 region:rollup2
LIVE PROGRAM WE BELIEVE IS THAT

02:01:46.933 --> 02:01:49.202 region:rollup2
WE DON'T DO FRIDAY NIGHT LIVE TO

COVERAGE PROGRAM SUCCESSFULLY

02:25:56.314 --> 02:26:00.885 region:rollup2
BUT ALSO TO HELP THEM WITH A

02:25:58.483 --> 02:26:02.721 region:rollup2
VERY DIFFICULT PROCESS IN MANY

02:26:00.885 --> 02:26:04.656 region:rollup2
SITUATIONS OF NAVIGATING THE

02:26:02.721 --> 02:26:06.124 region:rollup2
HEALTHCARE SYSTEM.

02:26:04.656 --> 02:26:07.926 region:rollup2
I COULD NOT HAVE T. THIS UP

02:26:06.124 --> 02:26:08.426 region:rollup2
BETTER MYSELF

02:26:07.926 --> 02:26:10.829 region:rollup2
WOMEN WHOSE HEALTH CARE

02:26:08.426 --> 02:26:13.231 region:rollup2
COVERAGE.

02:26:10.829 --> 02:26:14.766 region:rollup2
IS ENDING WHAT DO YOU DO.

02:26:13.231 --> 02:26:17.602 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WHO ARE IN

02:26:14.766 --> 02:26:20.071 region:rollup2
SMALL RURAL COUNTIES WITH VERY

02:26:17.602 --> 02:26:22.440 region:rollup2
NARROW NETWORKS OF PROVIDERS IN

02:26:20.071 --> 02:26:24.409 region:rollup2
EITHER THEIR. MEDI CAL PLAN OR

02:26:22.440 --> 02:26:24.876 region:rollup2
THEY'RE COVERED CALIFORNIA PLAN

02:26:24.409 --> 02:26:26.911 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES EVEN PRIVATE

02:26:24.876 --> 02:26:27.712 region:rollup2
INSURANCE.

02:26:26.911 --> 02:26:29.547 region:rollup2
HOW DO YOU GET HELP

02:26:27.712 --> 02:26:31.282 region:rollup2
FOR?

02:26:29.547 --> 02:26:33.251 region:rollup2
SEEING A SPECIALIST FOR GETTING

02:26:31.282 --> 02:26:35.020 region:rollup2
TRANSPORTATION FOR ACCESSING

02:26:33.251 --> 02:26:37.989 region:rollup2
MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES.

02:26:35.020 --> 02:26:40.892 region:rollup2
SO THIS REQUEST IS

02:26:37.989 --> 02:26:43.828 region:rollup2
STATEWIDE. AND ITS FOUR OUT

02:26:40.892 --> 02:26:45.563 region:rollup2
REGION ENROLLMENT BUT ALSO FOR

02:26:43.828 --> 02:26:46.998 region:rollup2
RETAINING COVERAGE AND FOR

02:26:45.563 --> 02:26:48.700 region:rollup2
HELPING PEOPLE ACTUALLY USE

02:26:46.998 --> 02:26:50.902 region:rollup2
COVERAGE.

02:26:48.700 --> 02:26:54.139 region:rollup2
OHM THE AMAZING AND HISTORIC

02:26:50.902 --> 02:26:56.007 region:rollup2
PRESENTATION THAT OPENED TODAY'S

02:26:54.139 --> 02:26:57.942 region:rollup2
HEARING. IS VERY MUCH

02:26:56.007 --> 02:27:01.179 region:rollup2
APPRECIATED.

02:26:57.942 --> 02:27:04.282 region:rollup2
AND WE KNOW HOWEVER THAT WITHOUT

02:27:01.179 --> 02:27:06.685 region:rollup2
MAINTAINING THIS WORK FORCE OF

02:27:04.282 --> 02:27:09.087 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS

02:27:06.685 --> 02:27:10.822 region:rollup2
TO ACTUALLY REACH THE PEOPLE WHO

02:27:09.087 --> 02:27:12.891 region:rollup2
WILL BE COVERED BY THE NEW

02:27:10.822 --> 02:27:15.260 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS.

02:27:12.891 --> 02:27:15.760 region:rollup2
THERE'S ONLY SO MUCH THAT CAN BE

02:27:15.260 --> 02:27:17.662 region:rollup2
DONE IN OTHER WORDS THE

02:27:15.760 --> 02:27:19.431 region:rollup2
COVERAGE.

02:27:17.662 --> 02:27:21.566 region:rollup2
AND

02:27:19.431 --> 02:27:23.234 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL ACCESS

02:27:21.566 --> 02:27:25.170 region:rollup2
ISN'T REALLY MEANINGFUL TO AN

02:27:23.234 --> 02:27:27.605 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL WHO DOESN'T KNOW

02:27:25.170 --> 02:27:29.774 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITY TO ENROLL.

02:27:27.605 --> 02:27:32.911 region:rollup2
WHO FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS MAY

02:27:29.774 --> 02:27:35.980 region:rollup2
NOT BE ABLE TO USE THE SYSTEM ON

02:27:32.911 --> 02:27:38.817 region:rollup2
THEIR OWN? LANGUAGE ACCESS BEING

02:27:35.980 --> 02:27:41.519 region:rollup2
A SENIOR HAVING A MENTAL HEALTH

02:27:38.817 --> 02:27:44.456 region:rollup2
ISSUE THERE ARE ALL KINDS OF

02:27:41.519 --> 02:27:46.324 region:rollup2
REASONS WHY PEOPLE EXPERIENCE

02:27:44.456 --> 02:27:48.026 region:rollup2
BARRIERS TO ENROLLMENT.

02:27:46.324 --> 02:27:50.995 region:rollup2
AND ADDING TO THAT THE CURRENT

02:27:48.026 --> 02:27:53.031 region:rollup2
CLIMATE OF FEAR WE HEARD A LOT

02:27:50.995 --> 02:27:54.699 region:rollup2
ABOUT THAT EARLIER TODAY AMONGST

02:27:53.031 --> 02:27:56.735 region:rollup2
IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES.

02:27:54.699 --> 02:27:58.136 region:rollup2
TO THE POINT WHERE WE'RE WORKING

02:27:56.735 --> 02:28:01.906 region:rollup2
WITH FAMILIES

02:27:58.136 --> 02:28:04.309 region:rollup2
WITH CITIZEN CHILDREN. WHO ARE

02:28:01.906 --> 02:28:06.878 region:rollup2
ACTIVELY AVOIDING HEALTH CARE

02:28:04.309 --> 02:28:08.747 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY ARE AFRAID? THAT A

02:28:06.878 --> 02:28:10.749 region:rollup2
FAMILY MEMBER.

02:28:08.747 --> 02:28:12.717 region:rollup2
WHO IS A CITIZEN?

02:28:10.749 --> 02:28:14.252 region:rollup2
COULD BE SUBJECTED TO SOME KIND

02:28:12.717 --> 02:28:16.221 region:rollup2
OF HARM.

02:28:14.252 --> 02:28:17.789 region:rollup2
AND ALSO BECAUSE THEY FEAR THE

02:28:16.221 --> 02:28:19.057 region:rollup2
DEPORTATION OF A PARENT OR

02:28:17.789 --> 02:28:20.725 region:rollup2
SIBLING

02:28:19.057 --> 02:28:22.861 region:rollup2
SO THESE COMMUNITY BASED

02:28:20.725 --> 02:28:24.295 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATIONS WORK WITH

02:28:22.861 --> 02:28:26.965 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES TO GIVE THEM

02:28:24.295 --> 02:28:29.134 region:rollup2
INFORMATION. TO TRY AND ADDRESS

02:28:26.965 --> 02:28:31.436 region:rollup2
THEIR CONCERNS TO HELP THEM GET

02:28:29.134 --> 02:28:33.338 region:rollup2
INTO PROGRAMS TO HELP THEM KEEP

02:28:31.436 --> 02:28:34.873 region:rollup2
THAT COVERAGE INTO LARRY FOR

02:28:33.338 --> 02:28:37.275 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE WHERE WE HEARD TODAY

02:28:34.873 --> 02:28:39.210 region:rollup2
FIFTY SIX PERCENT OF. THE

02:28:37.275 --> 02:28:42.013 region:rollup2
RESIDENTS OR ON THE MEDI CAL

02:28:39.210 --> 02:28:44.416 region:rollup2
PROGRAM A BIG PART OF BEING ON

02:28:42.013 --> 02:28:48.319 region:rollup2
THEIR PROGRAM INVOLVES.

02:28:44.416 --> 02:28:50.755 region:rollup2
GOING THROUGH PERIODIC REVIEWS

02:28:48.319 --> 02:28:52.524 region:rollup2
AND STATEWIDE IN TWENTY FIFTEEN

02:28:50.755 --> 02:28:54.993 region:rollup2
ONLY.

02:28:52.524 --> 02:28:56.928 region:rollup2
SIXTY FIVE PERCENT OF

02:28:54.993 --> 02:28:58.663 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS MADE IT THROUGH THAT

02:28:56.928 --> 02:29:00.231 region:rollup2
PROCESS WHEREAS WITH AND A

02:28:58.663 --> 02:29:02.634 region:rollup2
SISTER.

02:29:00.231 --> 02:29:04.302 region:rollup2
OF THE TYPE OF PROGRAM THAT I'M

02:29:02.634 --> 02:29:06.171 region:rollup2
REFERRING TO OF WE HAVE

02:29:04.302 --> 02:29:07.772 region:rollup2
RETENTION RATES IN THE EIGHTY TO

02:29:06.171 --> 02:29:10.008 region:rollup2
NINETY PERCENT RANGE

02:29:07.772 --> 02:29:12.977 region:rollup2
SO HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS DEPEND ON

02:29:10.008 --> 02:29:17.382 region:rollup2
THIS. THE CONSUMERS DEPEND ON IT

02:29:12.977 --> 02:29:20.218 region:rollup2
AND IT'S VERY EFFECTIVE ARM AND.

02:29:17.382 --> 02:29:22.187 region:rollup2
RETENTION I SHOULD ALSO MENTION

02:29:20.218 --> 02:29:24.456 region:rollup2
ARM IS CRITICAL BECAUSE IT

02:29:22.187 --> 02:29:27.459 region:rollup2
PREVENTS CHURNING IN THE SYSTEM

02:29:24.456 --> 02:29:29.427 region:rollup2
OF ELIGIBLE PEOPLE. A A A STUDY

02:29:27.459 --> 02:29:30.662 region:rollup2
FROM QUITE A FEW YEARS AGO SO

02:29:29.427 --> 02:29:32.730 region:rollup2
THE NUMBERS NOW WOULD BE MUCH

02:29:30.662 --> 02:29:34.766 region:rollup2
HIGHER EVERY TIME WE LOSE

02:29:32.730 --> 02:29:36.568 region:rollup2
SOMEONE TO A COVERAGE PROGRAM.

02:29:34.766 --> 02:29:37.702 region:rollup2
IT COSTS IN THE IN THE CASE OF

02:29:36.568 --> 02:29:38.937 region:rollup2
MEDI CAL IT COSTS ABOUT A

02:29:37.702 --> 02:29:40.572 region:rollup2
HUNDRED EIGHTY.

02:29:38.937 --> 02:29:42.607 region:rollup2
DOLLARS TO GET THAT PERSON BACK

02:29:40.572 --> 02:29:44.843 region:rollup2
GOD SO THESE ARE ELIGIBLE

02:29:42.607 --> 02:29:46.478 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE DIFFICULTY

02:29:44.843 --> 02:29:48.179 region:rollup2
MAINTAINING THE COVERAGE IN

02:29:46.478 --> 02:29:50.815 region:rollup2

02:29:53.218 --> 02:29:57.622 region:rollup2
CRITICAL PART OF OUR HEALTHCARE

02:29:56.120 --> 02:29:59.290 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE REALLY WEEKEND.

02:29:57.622 --> 02:30:01.392 region:rollup2

MEDICAL WORKFORCE WE CAN BUILD

02:30:01.392 --> 02:30:06.865 region:rollup2
OUT THE HOSPITAL'S A WE CAN.

02:30:04.262 --> 02:30:09.067 region:rollup2
INCREASE AND EXPAND THE TYPES OF

02:30:06.865 --> 02:30:10.235 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE ELIGIBLE BUT

02:30:09.067 --> 02:30:11.970 region:rollup2
IF WE DON'T GET THE MOST

02:30:10.235 --> 02:30:13.505 region:rollup2
VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES THE

02:30:11.970 --> 02:30:14.939 region:rollup2
ASSISTANCE THEY NEED TO ACTUALLY

02:30:13.505 --> 02:30:16.374 region:rollup2

.

02:54:13.276 --> 02:54:17.080 region:rollup2

WE CAN'T DO THAT AND SO THAT

02:54:31.594 --> 02:54:34.164 region:rollup2

WHICH IS A PROGRAM THAT PROVIDES

03:16:53.635 --> 03:16:57.606 region:rollup2
PREVENTIVE SERVICES FOR PEOPLE

03:16:56.138 --> 03:16:59.474 region:rollup2
WHO HAVE PRE DIABETES WHICH IS A

03:16:57.606 --> 03:17:00.742 region:rollup2
RISK FACTOR FOR DIABETES.

03:16:59.474 --> 03:17:01.710 region:rollup2
SINCE THE TIME THAT THAT WAS

03:17:00.742 --> 03:17:03.211 region:rollup2
APPROVED OF THE FIVE MILLION

03:17:01.710 --> 03:17:05.314 region:rollup2
DOLLAR ALLOCATION FROM THE

FUNDS FROM CMS.

03:17:07.282 --> 03:17:10.318 region:rollup2
AND SINCE THAT TIME ON THERE HAS

03:17:08.950 --> 03:17:12.020 region:rollup2
BEEN A COALITION WHICH WAS

03:17:10.318 --> 03:17:13.822 region:rollup2
CONVENED TO DISCUSS THE

03:17:12.020 --> 03:17:16.024 region:rollup2

DEPARTMENT HEALTHCARE SERVICES.

03:17:16.024 --> 03:17:18.360 region:rollup2
AS WELL AS.

03:17:16.825 --> 03:17:20.028 region:rollup2
THROUGH THE PUBLIC FOCUS

03:17:18.360 --> 03:17:21.363 region:rollup2
SERVICES TO THINK ABOUT WHAT IS

03:17:20.028 --> 03:17:23.432 region:rollup2
NECESSARY FOR PROPER

03:17:21.363 --> 03:17:24.966 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROGRAM.

03:17:23.432 --> 03:17:25.767 region:rollup2
IN THE PROCESS OF DOING THAT WE

03:17:24.966 --> 03:17:28.136 region:rollup2
DETERMINED THAT THERE WERE

03:17:25.767 --> 03:17:29.271 region:rollup2
SEVERAL THINGS THAT WOULD HELP

03:17:28.136 --> 03:17:30.539 region:rollup2
THE PROGRAM BE IMPLEMENTED

03:17:29.271 --> 03:17:32.607 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATELY.

03:17:30.539 --> 03:17:34.509 region:rollup2
THE FIRST OF WHICH IS ADDRESSING

03:17:32.607 --> 03:17:36.011 region:rollup2
BE LINGUISTIC REQUIREMENTS FOR

03:17:34.509 --> 03:17:37.112 region:rollup2
MEDICAID AND FOR MEDI CAL TO BE

03:17:36.011 --> 03:17:38.146 region:rollup2
ABLE TO HAVE THE PROGRAM

03:17:37.112 --> 03:17:39.781 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE AT ALL OF THE

03:17:38.146 --> 03:17:40.849 region:rollup2
THRESHOLD LANGUAGES. THEIR

03:17:39.781 --> 03:17:42.951 region:rollup2
THIRTEEN THRESHOLD LANGUAGES IN

03:17:40.849 --> 03:17:44.419 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA AND THE CURRENT

03:17:42.951 --> 03:17:47.155 region:rollup2
CURRICULUM IS ONLY AVAILABLE

03:17:44.419 --> 03:17:47.756 region:rollup2
INTO ENGLISH AND SPANISH.

03:17:47.155 --> 03:17:49.291 region:rollup2
AND SO IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE

03:17:47.756 --> 03:17:50.058 region:rollup2
THAT SERVICES ARE AVAILABLE TO

03:17:49.291 --> 03:17:52.427 region:rollup2
EVERYONE AND THAT THEIR

03:17:50.058 --> 03:17:52.661 region:rollup2
STANDARDIZED IN A WAY THAT MAKES

03:17:52.427 --> 03:17:54.796 region:rollup2
SENSE.

03:17:52.661 --> 03:17:55.931 region:rollup2
AND THAT WAS NOT DUPLICATIVE WE

03:17:54.796 --> 03:17:57.199 region:rollup2
ARE REQUESTING FIVE HUNDRED

03:17:55.931 --> 03:17:59.134 region:rollup2
THOUSAND DOLLARS TO BE ABLE TO

03:17:57.199 --> 03:18:00.602 region:rollup2
TRANSLATE THE OTHER INTO THE

03:17:59.134 --> 03:18:02.904 region:rollup2
OTHER ELEVEN LANGUAGES.

03:18:00.602 --> 03:18:04.106 region:rollup2
THIS WOULD ALLOW FOR EVERYONE

03:18:02.904 --> 03:18:05.807 region:rollup2
WHO IS IMPLEMENTING THE DIABETES

03:18:04.106 --> 03:18:07.743 region:rollup2
PREVENTION PROGRAM IN CALIFORNIA

03:18:05.807 --> 03:18:10.011 region:rollup2
TO BE ABLE TO HAVE ACCESS TO A

03:18:07.743 --> 03:18:12.647 region:rollup2
STANDARDIZED CURRICULUM THAT HAS

03:18:10.011 --> 03:18:14.549 region:rollup2
BEEN APPROVED TRANSLATION.

03:18:12.647 --> 03:18:16.418 region:rollup2
IN ADDITION WE ALSO FOUND TWO

03:18:14.549 --> 03:18:18.987 region:rollup2
FIXES THAT NEEDED TO TAKE PLACE

03:18:16.418 --> 03:18:20.922 region:rollup2
IN HOME IN THE CURRENT

03:18:18.987 --> 03:18:22.557 region:rollup2
LEGISLATION ONE IS AROUND.

03:18:20.922 --> 03:18:24.459 region:rollup2
THE FIVE PERCENT WEIGHT LOSS

03:18:22.557 --> 03:18:26.261 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENT FOR ONGOING SERVICES

03:18:24.459 --> 03:18:27.362 region:rollup2
THE CDC HAS.

03:18:26.261 --> 03:18:29.364 region:rollup2
HEADS OF ROBUST AMOUNT OF DATA

03:18:27.362 --> 03:18:30.632 region:rollup2
SHOWING THAT WEIGHT LOSS AT

03:18:29.364 --> 03:18:33.068 region:rollup2
LOWER AMOUNTS LOWER THRESHOLDS

03:18:30.632 --> 03:18:34.069 region:rollup2
ON IS ACTUALLY ASSOCIATED WITH

03:18:33.068 --> 03:18:34.569 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE OUTCOMES WERE

03:18:34.069 --> 03:18:35.070 region:rollup2
INTERESTED IN INCLUDING

03:18:34.569 --> 03:18:37.105 region:rollup2
PREVENTING THE ONSET OF

03:18:35.070 --> 03:18:38.473 region:rollup2
DIABETES.

03:18:37.105 --> 03:18:40.041 region:rollup2
AND SO ON THEY ARE IN THE

03:18:38.473 --> 03:18:41.243 region:rollup2
PROCESS RIGHT NOW CONSIDERING

03:18:40.041 --> 03:18:43.044 region:rollup2
WHETHER A LOWER THRESHOLD WILL

03:18:41.243 --> 03:18:44.946 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY BE USED AND SO WE WOULD

03:18:43.044 --> 03:18:46.782 region:rollup2
RATHER RATHER THAN STATE.

03:18:44.946 --> 03:18:47.382 region:rollup2
A SPECIFIC THRESHOLD THE

03:18:46.782 --> 03:18:48.984 region:rollup2
BACKROOM MATCH OURSELVES WITH

03:18:47.382 --> 03:18:50.552 region:rollup2
WHAT THE CDC HAS AND SO WE ARE

03:18:48.984 --> 03:18:51.219 region:rollup2
ASKING THAT THAT BE TAKEN OUT OF

03:18:50.552 --> 03:18:53.555 region:rollup2
THE CURRENT.

03:18:51.219 --> 03:18:55.323 region:rollup2
WELFARE INSTITUTIONS CODE I'M

03:18:53.555 --> 03:18:55.824 region:rollup2
IN ADDITION WERE ALSO ASKING

03:18:55.323 --> 03:18:57.592 region:rollup2
THAT.

03:18:55.824 --> 03:18:59.394 region:rollup2
THE ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA THAT

03:18:57.592 --> 03:19:00.762 region:rollup2
ARE SPECIFICALLY STATED HARM IN

03:18:59.394 --> 03:19:02.330 region:rollup2
THE CURRENT LEGISLATION BE

03:19:00.762 --> 03:19:03.765 region:rollup2
REMOVED AS WELL BECAUSE THEY

03:19:02.330 --> 03:19:05.367 region:rollup2
DIFFER FROM THE CDC AND THAT

03:19:03.765 --> 03:19:06.768 region:rollup2
WOULD RENDER MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE

03:19:05.367 --> 03:19:08.403 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY ELIGIBLE FOR THE

03:19:06.768 --> 03:19:09.371 region:rollup2
PROGRAM BASED ON CDC STANDARDS.

03:19:08.403 --> 03:19:11.273 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD RENDER THEM ILL

03:19:09.371 --> 03:19:12.407 region:rollup2
INELIGIBLE AND THE GOAL OF THE

03:19:11.273 --> 03:19:16.344 region:rollup2
PROGRAM IS TO BE ABLE TO HAVE AS

03:19:12.407 --> 03:19:16.778 region:rollup2
MANY PEOPLE WHO HAVE PRE

03:19:16.344 --> 03:19:20.615 region:rollup2
DIABETES AS POSSIBLE

OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT THIS

03:27:22.797 --> 03:27:26.601 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL TO EXPAND THE MEDI CAL

03:27:24.866 --> 03:27:28.770 region:rollup2
ALCOHOL SCREENING BENEFIT TO

03:27:26.601 --> 03:27:31.172 region:rollup2
INCLUDE SCREENING FOR OPIATES

03:27:28.770 --> 03:27:32.807 region:rollup2
AND OTHER ILLICIT DRUGS.

03:27:31.172 --> 03:27:33.908 region:rollup2
SO AS I KNOW YOU'RE ALL WELL

03:27:32.807 --> 03:27:35.643 region:rollup2
AWARE WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF AN

03:27:33.908 --> 03:27:37.578 region:rollup2
OPIATE CRISIS THAT CLAIMED THE

03:27:35.643 --> 03:27:39.347 region:rollup2
LIVES OF MORE THAN TWO THOUSAND

03:27:37.578 --> 03:27:40.481 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIANS AND TWENTY SIXTEEN.

03:27:39.347 --> 03:27:41.783 region:rollup2
AND TO FULLY CONFRONT THIS

03:27:40.481 --> 03:27:43.985 region:rollup2
CRISIS ONE OF THE THINGS WE NEED

03:27:41.783 --> 03:27:45.053 region:rollup2
TO DO IS IDENTIFY MORE PEOPLE

03:27:43.985 --> 03:27:46.554 region:rollup2
ACROSS THE STATE WHO ARE

03:27:45.053 --> 03:27:48.589 region:rollup2
MISUSING OPIOIDS AND CONNECT

03:27:46.554 --> 03:27:50.091 region:rollup2
THEM TO TREATMENT.

03:27:48.589 --> 03:27:52.694 region:rollup2
EXPANDING DRUG SCREENING IN MEDI

03:27:50.091 --> 03:27:53.795 region:rollup2
CAL PRIMARY CARE IS A LOW COST

03:27:52.694 --> 03:27:55.563 region:rollup2
BUT POTENTIALLY HIGH IMPACT

03:27:53.795 --> 03:27:57.231 region:rollup2
STRATEGY THAT CAN HELP MORE

03:27:55.563 --> 03:27:59.968 region:rollup2
PEOPLE ACCESS LIFESAVING CARE

03:27:57.231 --> 03:28:01.269 region:rollup2
FOR THEIR SUBSTANCE USE.

03:27:59.968 --> 03:28:03.037 region:rollup2
AND TO BRIEFLY SUMMARIZE WHAT

03:28:01.269 --> 03:28:04.939 region:rollup2
WOULD CHANGE UNDER THIS PROPOSAL

03:28:03.037 --> 03:28:07.275 region:rollup2
AND MEDI CAL PRIMARY CARE

03:28:04.939 --> 03:28:08.977 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS AT PRESENT. CAN SCREEN

03:28:07.275 --> 03:28:10.845 region:rollup2
ADULT BENEFICIARIES FOR A RANGE

03:28:08.977 --> 03:28:12.714 region:rollup2
OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH NEEDS

03:28:10.845 --> 03:28:14.716 region:rollup2
INCLUDING ALCOHOL MISUSE AND IF

03:28:12.714 --> 03:28:16.284 region:rollup2
A CLIENT REPORTS ALCOHOL MISUSE

03:28:14.716 --> 03:28:18.353 region:rollup2
THE PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER CAN BE

03:28:16.284 --> 03:28:19.587 region:rollup2
REIMBURSED FOR ADMINISTERING

03:28:18.353 --> 03:28:22.023 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL SCREENING TO ASSESS

03:28:19.587 --> 03:28:23.758 region:rollup2
ALCOHOL USE. AND FOR CONDUCTING

03:28:22.023 --> 03:28:25.093 region:rollup2
A BRIEF COUNSELING OR EDUCATION

03:28:23.758 --> 03:28:27.729 region:rollup2
SESSION AND THEN REFERRING THE

03:28:25.093 --> 03:28:29.564 region:rollup2
PERSON TO TREATMENT AS NEEDED.

03:28:27.729 --> 03:28:32.100 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW PRIMARY CARE

03:28:29.564 --> 03:28:33.835 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS OR A MEDICAID MANAGED

03:28:32.100 --> 03:28:35.570 region:rollup2
CARE PLANS COULD CHOOSE TO

03:28:33.835 --> 03:28:37.972 region:rollup2
SCREEN CLIENTS FOR ILLICIT DRUG

03:28:35.570 --> 03:28:39.574 region:rollup2
USE TIME BUT IF A CLIENT WERE TO

03:28:37.972 --> 03:28:41.342 region:rollup2
DISCLOSE DRUG MISUSE THE PRIDE

03:28:39.574 --> 03:28:42.944 region:rollup2
PROVIDER CANNOT RECEIVE MEDICAL

03:28:41.342 --> 03:28:44.946 region:rollup2
REIMBURSEMENT FOR ANY FURTHER

03:28:42.944 --> 03:28:46.647 region:rollup2
TIME THEY SPEND. WITH THAT

03:28:44.946 --> 03:28:48.349 region:rollup2
PERSON ADDRESSING THEIR DRUG USE

03:28:46.647 --> 03:28:51.386 region:rollup2
SO UNFORTUNATELY THERE'S A

03:28:48.349 --> 03:28:51.953 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL DISINCENTIVE TO I'M

03:28:51.386 --> 03:28:53.121 region:rollup2
OFFER THE SCREENING IN THIS

03:28:51.953 --> 03:28:54.956 region:rollup2
CARE.

03:28:53.121 --> 03:28:56.724 region:rollup2
SO UNDER THIS PROPOSAL. A

03:28:54.956 --> 03:28:57.959 region:rollup2
MEDICAL PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS

03:28:56.724 --> 03:28:59.994 region:rollup2
WOULD CONDUCT ROUTINE DRUG

03:28:57.959 --> 03:29:01.129 region:rollup2
SCREENING ALONGSIDE THE ALCOHOL

03:28:59.994 --> 03:29:02.497 region:rollup2
SCREENING THAT THEY'RE ALREADY

03:29:01.129 --> 03:29:04.065 region:rollup2
OFFERINGAND THEY COULD THEN

03:29:02.497 --> 03:29:05.633 region:rollup2
RECEIVE REIMBURSEMENT FOR THE

03:29:04.065 --> 03:29:06.801 region:rollup2
EDUCATION COUNSELING AND

03:29:05.633 --> 03:29:08.770 region:rollup2
REFERRALS THAT THEY DELIVER FOR

03:29:06.801 --> 03:29:10.371 region:rollup2
DRUG MISUSE.

03:29:08.770 --> 03:29:11.973 region:rollup2
AND IDEALLY THIS JAMES WELL AND

03:29:10.371 --> 03:29:13.408 region:rollup2
SO SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE THE

03:29:11.973 --> 03:29:14.675 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO ARE

03:29:13.408 --> 03:29:16.911 region:rollup2
SUCCESSFULLY REFERRED FROM

03:29:14.675 --> 03:29:17.378 region:rollup2
PRIMARY CARE TWO SPECIALTIES

03:29:16.911 --> 03:29:19.280 region:rollup2
SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER

03:29:17.378 --> 03:29:20.681 region:rollup2
TREATMENT.

03:29:19.280 --> 03:29:22.550 region:rollup2
AND ON AT THAT AND DO YOU SEE US

03:29:20.681 --> 03:29:24.018 region:rollup2
HAS ESTIMATED THAT THIS EXPANDED

03:29:22.550 --> 03:29:25.987 region:rollup2
SCREENING FOR THE ADULT MEDICAL

03:29:24.018 --> 03:29:27.255 region:rollup2
POPULATION WOULD COST ABOUT

03:29:25.987 --> 03:29:29.490 region:rollup2
EIGHT POINT FOUR MILLION

03:29:27.255 --> 03:29:31.059 region:rollup2
ANNUALLY. BUT THAT'S ACTUALLY

03:29:29.490 --> 03:29:32.827 region:rollup2
ONLY TWO POINT FIVE EIGHT

03:29:31.059 --> 03:29:34.595 region:rollup2
MILLION IN STATE GENERAL FUNDS

03:29:32.827 --> 03:29:36.364 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD BE USED TO DRIVE DOWN

03:29:34.595 --> 03:29:37.865 region:rollup2
FIVE POINT EIGHT MILLION IN

03:29:36.364 --> 03:29:39.667 region:rollup2
FEDERAL FINANCIAL PARTICIPATION

03:29:37.865 --> 03:29:41.536 region:rollup2
UNDER MEDICAID.

03:29:39.667 --> 03:29:43.771 region:rollup2
SO WE WOULD UNDERSCORE THAT THIS

03:29:41.536 --> 03:29:44.939 region:rollup2
IS A RELATIVELY LOW COST

03:29:43.771 --> 03:29:46.974 region:rollup2
INTERVENTION IT CAN BE

03:29:44.939 --> 03:29:48.676 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTED USING EXISTING

03:29:46.974 --> 03:29:50.178 region:rollup2
PROCEDURES AND INFRASTRUCTURE.

03:29:48.676 --> 03:29:51.312 region:rollup2
AND IT HAS A GREAT POTENTIAL TO

03:29:50.178 --> 03:29:52.747 region:rollup2
SAVE LIVES AND I'M AND EVEN SAVE

03:29:51.312 --> 03:29:53.948 region:rollup2
MONEY.

03:29:52.747 --> 03:29:54.949 region:rollup2
TO THE EXTENT THAT EXPANDED

03:29:53.948 --> 03:29:56.784 region:rollup2
SCREENING WILL HELP MORE PEOPLE

03:29:54.949 --> 03:29:58.986 region:rollup2
ACCESS TREATMENT AND COST

03:29:56.784 --> 03:30:00.354 region:rollup2
BENEFIT ANALYSES HAVE REPEATEDLY

03:29:58.986 --> 03:30:02.056 region:rollup2
SHOWN THAT AS YOU DO TREATMENT.

03:30:00.354 --> 03:30:04.092 region:rollup2
CAN REDUCE EXPENDITURES ON OTHER

03:30:02.056 --> 03:30:06.094 region:rollup2
HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND ON DRUG

03:30:04.092 --> 03:30:07.528 region:rollup2
RELATED CRIMINAL JUSTICE COSTS.

03:30:06.094 --> 03:30:09.630 region:rollup2
AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT THIS MODEL

03:30:07.528 --> 03:30:11.332 region:rollup2
OF SCREENING BRIEF INTERVENTION

03:30:09.630 --> 03:30:13.301 region:rollup2
AND REFERRAL TO TREATMENT. IS

03:30:11.332 --> 03:30:14.335 region:rollup2
ASSOCIATED WITH AND REDUCTIONS

03:30:13.301 --> 03:30:16.170 region:rollup2
IN A PERSON SUBSTANCE USE OVER

03:30:14.335 --> 03:30:18.272 region:rollup2
TIME.

03:30:16.170 --> 03:30:19.207 region:rollup2
SO TO CONCLUDE EXPANDING DRUG

03:30:18.272 --> 03:30:20.608 region:rollup2
SCREENING IN PRIMARY CARE

03:30:19.207 --> 03:30:22.176 region:rollup2
SETTINGS IS JUST ONE MORE

03:30:20.608 --> 03:30:23.544 region:rollup2
CRITICAL TO ALL THAT WE CAN ADD

03:30:22.176 --> 03:30:25.179 region:rollup2
TO OUR TOOLBOX TO ADDRESS THE

03:30:23.544 --> 03:30:26.981 region:rollup2
OPIATE CRISIS.

03:30:25.179 --> 03:30:28.516 region:rollup2
A A NUMBER OF OTHER STATES

03:30:26.981 --> 03:30:30.251 region:rollup2
INCLUDING OUR NORTHERN NEIGHBOR

03:30:28.516 --> 03:30:31.986 region:rollup2
OR AGAIN ANDS AND THE VERY

03:36:53.734 --> 03:36:57.972 region:rollup2
WITH TEACHERS FOR HEALTHY KIDS.

03:36:55.503 --> 03:37:00.040 region:rollup2
AND AND I HAVE SOME MUSIC TEARS

03:36:57.972 --> 03:37:02.910 region:rollup2
THIS IS A NO COST ITEM.

03:37:00.040 --> 03:37:04.478 region:rollup2
SO WHAT THIS IS IS IT'S A IT'S A

03:37:02.910 --> 03:37:06.113 region:rollup2
LANGUAGE REQUEST

03:37:04.478 --> 03:37:06.981 region:rollup2
AND WE HAVE ANOTHER PROPOSAL

03:37:06.113 --> 03:37:08.749 region:rollup2
THAT'S IN THE EDUCATION

03:37:06.981 --> 03:37:10.451 region:rollup2

FUNDS IT'S GOING TO BE HEARD.

03:37:10.451 --> 03:37:13.521 region:rollup2
SO WHAT THIS WOULD DO IS THAT

03:37:11.852 --> 03:37:15.022 region:rollup2
WOULD ALLOW SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO

03:37:13.521 --> 03:37:16.223 region:rollup2
TRANSFER AYE CAPTAIN OUT

03:37:15.022 --> 03:37:17.458 region:rollup2
ANNUALLY A FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND

03:37:16.223 --> 03:37:18.759 region:rollup2
DOLLARS.

03:37:17.458 --> 03:37:20.928 region:rollup2
WHICH IS THREE TENTHS OF ONE

03:37:18.759 --> 03:37:22.796 region:rollup2
PERCENT OF THE AMOUNT THAT THEY

03:37:20.928 --> 03:37:24.465 region:rollup2
RECEIVED BACK FOR UP FROM

03:37:22.796 --> 03:37:25.633 region:rollup2
FEDERAL REIMBURSEMENT WHICH IS

03:37:24.465 --> 03:37:26.734 region:rollup2
AROUND A HUNDRED AND FIFTY

03:37:25.633 --> 03:37:28.269 region:rollup2
MILLION FOR THE LAST YEAR BUT

03:37:26.734 --> 03:37:29.703 region:rollup2
IT'S BEEN GOING UP.

03:37:28.269 --> 03:37:31.205 region:rollup2
THEY RECEIVE BACK FOR HEALTH

03:37:29.703 --> 03:37:32.573 region:rollup2
SERVICES THAT ARE PROVIDED IN

03:37:31.205 --> 03:37:34.174 region:rollup2
THE SCHOOLS THROUGH THE ALLEY A

03:37:32.573 --> 03:37:35.442 region:rollup2
BILLING OPTION PROGRAM.

03:37:34.174 --> 03:37:37.111 region:rollup2
SO THE PA COST PER SCHOOL

03:37:35.442 --> 03:37:38.612 region:rollup2
DISTRICT IS NINE HUNDRED THIRTY

03:37:37.111 --> 03:37:40.080 region:rollup2
THREE DOLLARS.

03:37:38.612 --> 03:37:41.582 region:rollup2
THERE'S RIGHT NOW THERE'S NO

03:37:40.080 --> 03:37:42.583 region:rollup2
CENTRAL LOCATION WITHIN THE

03:37:41.582 --> 03:37:43.484 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF

03:37:42.583 --> 03:37:44.952 region:rollup2
EDUCATION FOR SCHOOL BASED

03:37:43.484 --> 03:37:46.020 region:rollup2
SERVICES.

03:37:44.952 --> 03:37:47.388 region:rollup2
AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT

03:37:46.020 --> 03:37:49.557 region:rollup2
ALMOST EVERY STATE THAT WE'VE

03:37:47.388 --> 03:37:50.724 region:rollup2
BEEN ABLE TO TALK TO ACT PASSED

03:37:49.557 --> 03:37:52.259 region:rollup2
SO CALIFORNIA'S REALLY BEHIND IN

03:37:50.724 --> 03:37:54.528 region:rollup2
THIS.

03:37:52.259 --> 03:37:56.030 region:rollup2
I'M THERE ARE SINCE THESE FUNDS

03:37:54.528 --> 03:37:57.731 region:rollup2
ARE ACTUALLY IN STATUTE IN WHAT

03:37:56.030 --> 03:37:59.900 region:rollup2
I PASSED OUT HAS A COPY OF THE

03:37:59.900 --> 03:38:03.570 region:rollup2
THE STATUTE TO ALLOW THIS FIVE

03:38:02.436 --> 03:38:05.873 region:rollup2
HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS AND TO

03:38:03.570 --> 03:38:08.075 region:rollup2
SET UP THE TRANSFER MECHANISM.

03:38:05.873 --> 03:38:09.810 region:rollup2
TO THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION

03:38:08.075 --> 03:38:11.879 region:rollup2
WHICH IS WHAT THE LANGUAGE DOES.

03:38:09.810 --> 03:38:13.747 region:rollup2
AND I'M THE OTHER SUBCOMMITTEE

03:38:11.879 --> 03:38:14.915 region:rollup2
WILL BE HEARING THE ITEM OR I

03:38:13.747 --> 03:38:16.450 region:rollup2
THINK HAS ALREADY AGREED ON TWO

03:38:14.915 --> 03:38:18.385 region:rollup2
HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND AND

03:38:16.450 --> 03:38:20.154 region:rollup2
ONE TIME FUNDS. THAT FOR THIS

03:38:18.385 --> 03:38:21.689 region:rollup2
YEAR TO GET IT STARTED WITH THIS

03:38:20.154 --> 03:38:23.524 region:rollup2
IS ONGOING AND THERE WILL BE

03:38:21.689 --> 03:38:25.392 region:rollup2
OTHER FUNDS THAT WOULD ALSO BE

03:38:23.524 --> 03:38:26.160 region:rollup2
ABLE TO GO TO THIS OFFICE.

03:38:25.392 --> 03:38:27.661 region:rollup2
SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE WILLING TO

03:38:26.160 --> 03:38:29.263 region:rollup2
UNDERWRITE THIS.

03:38:27.661 --> 03:38:30.497 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT GENERAL FUND AND WE

03:38:29.263 --> 03:38:31.899 region:rollup2
JUST NEED THE MECHANISM FOR THE

03:38:30.497 --> 03:38:33.434 region:rollup2
TRANSFER.

03:38:31.899 --> 03:38:35.102 region:rollup2
OTHERWISE CD WOULD HAVE TO

03:38:33.434 --> 03:38:36.971 region:rollup2

THIRTY SIX SCHOOL DISTRICTS.

03:38:38.706 --> 03:38:41.775 region:rollup2
FOUR NINE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE

03:38:39.907 --> 03:38:43.978 region:rollup2
DOLLARS APIECE AND THAT SEEMS TO

03:38:41.775 --> 03:38:45.746 region:rollup2
BE A REALLY INEFFICIENT WAY TO

03:38:43.978 --> 03:38:47.281 region:rollup2
MAKE THIS HAPPEN INSTEAD A

03:38:45.746 --> 03:38:48.649 region:rollup2
DIRECT TRANSFER BETWEEN THE

03:38:47.281 --> 03:38:50.618 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENTS SEEMS TO BE THE

03:38:48.649 --> 03:38:52.753 region:rollup2
BETTER AVENUE. AND SO WE WOULD

03:38:50.618 --> 03:38:53.854 region:rollup2
ASK UP FOR YOU TO PUT THIS IS

03:38:52.753 --> 03:38:55.622 region:rollup2

ARE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THE

03:39:06.633 --> 03:39:10.938 region:rollup2
SENATE ADMINISTRATIVE APPROACH

TO THE LA BILLING PROGRAM. I

03:39:10.938 --> 03:39:15.309 region:rollup2
THINK YOU MAY BE AWARE THAT TO A

RECENTLY CMS ARE ESSENTIALLY

03:39:15.309 --> 03:39:18.278 region:rollup2
REMOVE THE FREE CARE RULE. AND

03:39:16.877 --> 03:39:20.581 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THAT NOW THEY WILL BE

03:39:18.278 --> 03:39:21.749 region:rollup2
A HUGE INCREASE IN TERMS OF.

REALLY ADVANCES THE USE BY LOCAL

PATCHWORK OF RESEARCH FUNDING

03:58:25.791 --> 03:58:29.595 region:rollup2
WHICH IS ALWAYS DIFFICULT.

03:58:27.160 --> 03:58:30.963 region:rollup2
ON RESEARCH GRANTS TO JUSTIFY A

03:58:29.595 --> 03:58:32.298 region:rollup2
PROGRAMMER SALARY IT'S GOT TO BE

03:58:30.963 --> 03:58:33.499 region:rollup2
A CERTAIN TYPE OF GRANT THAT

03:58:32.298 --> 03:58:34.834 region:rollup2

AGENCIES.

03:58:34.834 --> 03:58:37.904 region:rollup2

03:59:02.295 --> 03:59:05.398 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE BEST EXAMPLES OF A

04:01:54.333 --> 04:01:57.903 region:rollup2
HELPS TO COUPLE THAT PROGRAM

04:01:56.302 --> 04:01:59.438 region:rollup2
WITH SOME ADDITIONAL FUNDS TO BE

04:01:57.903 --> 04:02:00.973 region:rollup2
ABLE TO DO OUTREACH.

04:01:59.438 --> 04:02:02.074 region:rollup2
AND ENROLLMENT ON ONE OF THE

MEAN CALIFORNIA FIFTY FIVE

04:02:07.747 --> 04:02:11.617 region:rollup2
PERCENT OF THE POPULATION HAS

04:02:09.682 --> 04:02:12.685 region:rollup2
PRE DIABETES. OP OR DIABETES BUT

04:02:11.617 --> 04:02:14.387 region:rollup2
MANY PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THAT THEY

04:02:12.685 --> 04:02:15.888 region:rollup2
HAVE IT AND THEY ALSO NEED TO

04:02:14.387 --> 04:02:17.223 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND THE PERSONAL RISK ON

04:02:15.888 --> 04:02:18.524 region:rollup2
IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO THEN MOVE

04:02:17.223 --> 04:02:19.792 region:rollup2
TO THE THIRD STEP WITH IT WHICH

04:02:18.524 --> 04:02:21.193 region:rollup2
IS ACTUALLY REACHING OUT AND

04:02:19.792 --> 04:02:22.595 region:rollup2
ACCESSING RESOURCES AND SO SINCE

04:02:21.193 --> 04:02:23.496 region:rollup2
WE HAD THE DIABETES. PREVENTION

04:02:22.595 --> 04:02:24.597 region:rollup2
PROGRAM

04:02:23.496 --> 04:02:27.099 region:rollup2
THAT'S GOING TO BE WATCHING AND

04:02:24.597 --> 04:02:28.868 region:rollup2
MEDI CAL UP IN JANUARY AS WELL

04:02:27.099 --> 04:02:30.770 region:rollup2
AS ON DIABETES TREATMENT

04:02:28.868 --> 04:02:31.537 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS WE REALLY WANT TO MAKE

04:02:30.770 --> 04:02:33.372 region:rollup2
SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE AWARE OF

THE RISK. AND ALSO AWARE OF THE

04:02:33.372 --> 04:02:36.776 region:rollup2
RESOURCES AND SO THIS IS A ONE

04:02:35.241 --> 04:02:38.077 region:rollup2
TIME ALLOCATION OF TEN MILLION

04:02:36.776 --> 04:02:39.345 region:rollup2
DOLLARS TO THE CALIFORNIA

04:02:38.077 --> 04:02:40.946 region:rollup2

OUTREACH AND ENROLLMENT.

04:02:44.350 --> 04:02:48.287 region:rollup2

WHERE THE GAPS AND WHAT WOULD

04:03:20.352 --> 04:03:22.822 region:rollup2
THIS LOOK LIKE THE BILL WOULD BE

04:03:22.321 --> 04:03:24.290 region:rollup2
A TAILORED CAMPAIGN FOR

04:03:22.822 --> 04:03:25.858 region:rollup2

TO HEAR FROM YOU THIS EVENING

04:04:47.473 --> 04:04:54.513 region:rollup2
APART WITH.

04:04:48.274 --> 04:04:56.482 region:rollup2
READY.

04:04:54.513 --> 04:04:57.883 region:rollup2
AS AS I'M SURE YOU ARE AWARE

04:04:56.482 --> 04:04:59.184 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE HAVE JUST RECENTLY

04:04:57.883 --> 04:05:00.753 region:rollup2
HAD A HEARING ABOUT IT

04:04:59.184 --> 04:05:02.021 region:rollup2
ADVERTISED EXPERIENCES AS A

04:05:00.753 --> 04:05:04.590 region:rollup2
MAJOR PROBLEM IN.

04:05:02.021 --> 04:05:05.925 region:rollup2
FOR YOUTH IN PARTICULAR.

04:05:04.590 --> 04:05:06.892 region:rollup2
THERE THE ORIGINAL IS A STUDY

04:05:05.925 --> 04:05:08.794 region:rollup2
WAS DONE AND FOUND THAT TWO

04:05:06.892 --> 04:05:10.329 region:rollup2
THIRDS OF ADULTS HAD AT LEAST

04:05:08.794 --> 04:05:12.364 region:rollup2
ONE ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCE

04:05:10.329 --> 04:05:13.299 region:rollup2
IN ONE IN EIGHT HAD FOR MORE.

04:05:12.364 --> 04:05:14.867 region:rollup2
THAN THAT THERE'S A DOSE

04:05:13.299 --> 04:05:16.302 region:rollup2
RESPONSE BETWEEN HAVING ADVERSE

04:05:14.867 --> 04:05:18.470 region:rollup2
CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES AT A

04:05:16.302 --> 04:05:20.105 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF CHRONIC CONDITIONS UP

04:05:18.470 --> 04:05:20.739 region:rollup2
AS WELL AS BEHAVIORAL OUTCOMES

04:05:20.105 --> 04:05:22.241 region:rollup2
THAT WE DON'T THINK

04:05:20.739 --> 04:05:23.175 region:rollup2
TRADITIONALLY ARE ASSOCIATED

04:05:22.241 --> 04:05:25.211 region:rollup2
WITH THINGS THAT HAPPEN IN OUR

04:05:23.175 --> 04:05:26.579 region:rollup2
CHILDHOOD THINGS LIKE DIABETES.

04:05:25.211 --> 04:05:28.180 region:rollup2
AND CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE BUT

04:05:26.579 --> 04:05:30.583 region:rollup2
ALSO THINGS LIKE SMOKING.

04:05:28.180 --> 04:05:33.018 region:rollup2
ENGAGING IN IN VIOLENT BEHAVIOR

04:05:30.583 --> 04:05:33.586 region:rollup2
AND EVEN I'M BEING ARRESTED AND

04:05:33.018 --> 04:05:34.987 region:rollup2
BEING CONVICTED OF FELONIES

04:05:33.586 --> 04:05:36.288 region:rollup2
AND SO FOR THAT REASON THERE'S

04:05:34.987 --> 04:05:37.356 region:rollup2
BEEN A LOT OF ATTENTION HAS

04:05:36.288 --> 04:05:38.691 region:rollup2
THERE'S BEEN A GROWING BODY OF

04:05:37.356 --> 04:05:40.492 region:rollup2
EVIDENCE AROUND ADVERSE TODD

04:05:38.691 --> 04:05:41.860 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCES. AND THE POSSIBILITY

04:05:40.492 --> 04:05:43.963 region:rollup2
OF BEING ABLE TO DO SOMETHING

04:05:41.860 --> 04:05:45.531 region:rollup2
ABOUT THEM TO PREVENT THE HARM

04:05:43.963 --> 04:05:46.999 region:rollup2
THAT IS CAUSED BY TALK FIXTURES

04:05:45.531 --> 04:05:49.101 region:rollup2
AS WELL AS BY BEING ABLE TO

04:05:46.999 --> 04:05:51.136 region:rollup2
PREVENT. OP TRAUMA IN THE FIRST

04:05:49.101 --> 04:05:52.004 region:rollup2
PLACE AND SO WHAT WE HAVE

04:05:51.136 --> 04:05:55.441 region:rollup2
PROPOSED HERE.

04:05:52.004 --> 04:05:57.476 region:rollup2
IS A CAMPAIGN THAT WOULD

04:05:55.441 --> 04:05:59.545 region:rollup2
INCLUDE BRING TOGETHER

04:05:57.476 --> 04:06:01.814 region:rollup2
STAKEHOLDERS ON THAT UNDERSTAND

04:05:59.545 --> 04:06:03.549 region:rollup2
SOME OF THIS WORK AND ALLOW THEM

04:06:01.814 --> 04:06:05.484 region:rollup2
TO BE ABLE TO WORK THROUGH THE

04:06:03.549 --> 04:06:06.552 region:rollup2
PROCESS OF PILOTING FROM SO

04:06:05.484 --> 04:06:07.987 region:rollup2
INITIALLY THERE WOULD BE.

04:06:06.552 --> 04:06:09.755 region:rollup2
AN INTERNATIONAL LITERATURE

04:06:07.987 --> 04:06:11.390 region:rollup2
REVIEW TO BE ABLE TO DETERMINE

04:06:09.755 --> 04:06:13.792 region:rollup2
WHERE WE ARE IN TERMS OF SOME OF

04:06:11.390 --> 04:06:14.893 region:rollup2
THE THE PROTOCOLS AROUND ADVERSE

04:06:13.792 --> 04:06:16.362 region:rollup2
CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES.

04:06:14.893 --> 04:06:18.397 region:rollup2
AND THEN MOVING ON TO FINDING

04:06:16.362 --> 04:06:20.532 region:rollup2
BEST PRACTICES SO WHAT HAS BEEN

04:06:18.397 --> 04:06:22.267 region:rollup2
DONE ON THE HAS BEEN EFFECTIVE

04:06:20.532 --> 04:06:23.902 region:rollup2
THAT COULD BE TRIED IN PLACES

04:06:22.267 --> 04:06:25.371 region:rollup2
THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA

04:06:23.902 --> 04:06:26.905 region:rollup2
AND THE DEVELOPING A TOOL KIT

04:06:25.371 --> 04:06:28.507 region:rollup2
THAT COULD BE USED.

04:06:26.905 --> 04:06:29.975 region:rollup2
TO BE ABLE FOR A CITIES AND

04:06:28.507 --> 04:06:31.276 region:rollup2
COUNTIES TO BE ABLE TO.

04:06:29.975 --> 04:06:33.779 region:rollup2
TO IMPLEMENT SOME OF THE

04:06:31.276 --> 04:06:35.214 region:rollup2
STRATEGIES AND THEN PILOTING IN

04:06:33.779 --> 04:06:36.815 region:rollup2
AT LEAST TWELVE CITIES OR

04:06:35.214 --> 04:06:38.450 region:rollup2
COUNTIES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA.

04:06:36.815 --> 04:06:40.419 region:rollup2
FOCUSING IN PARTICULAR ON

04:06:38.450 --> 04:06:41.820 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES THAT ARE LOW ARE OF

04:06:40.419 --> 04:06:42.988 region:rollup2
LOWER INCOME BECAUSE WE KNOW

04:06:41.820 --> 04:06:44.556 region:rollup2
THAT THERE'S A COMBINATION OF

04:06:42.988 --> 04:06:46.091 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL TRAUMAS AS WELL AS

04:06:44.556 --> 04:06:46.892 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY TRAUMAS

04:06:46.091 --> 04:06:48.594 region:rollup2
THERE ARE CONCENTRATED IN THOSE

04:06:46.892 --> 04:06:50.095 region:rollup2
AREAS. AND THEN PROVIDING

04:06:48.594 --> 04:06:51.063 region:rollup2
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IN THAT

04:06:50.095 --> 04:06:52.765 region:rollup2
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE WOULD

04:06:51.063 --> 04:06:54.199 region:rollup2
INCLUDE A LOCAL ADVISORY ON

04:06:52.765 --> 04:06:56.201 region:rollup2

04:06:54.199 --> 04:06:57.269 region:rollup2
LISTENING SESSIONS AND ALSO THE

04:06:56.201 --> 04:06:58.804 region:rollup2
ABILITY FOR THAT.

04:06:57.269 --> 04:07:00.205 region:rollup2
FOR THOSE BOARDS TO BE ABLE TO

04:06:58.804 --> 04:07:01.607 region:rollup2
PRIORITIZE WHAT IS DONE IN THOSE

04:07:00.205 --> 04:07:03.208 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES SO REALLY IS A

04:07:01.607 --> 04:07:05.210 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY INFORMED INITIATIVE.

04:07:03.208 --> 04:07:05.644 region:rollup2
AND SO THE IDEA WOULD BE THAT

04:07:05.210 --> 04:07:07.446 region:rollup2
THAT.

04:07:05.644 --> 04:07:09.348 region:rollup2
THE REQUEST IS FIFTEEN MILLION

04:07:07.446 --> 04:07:11.784 region:rollup2
DOLLARS FOR AS A ONE TIME

04:07:09.348 --> 04:07:13.352 region:rollup2
ALLOCATION TO BE ABLE TO UP TO

04:07:11.784 --> 04:07:14.553 region:rollup2
DO THIS WORK AND BE ABLE TO THEN

04:07:13.352 --> 04:07:15.654 region:rollup2
COME BACK WITH FORMAL

04:07:14.553 --> 04:07:17.856 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATIONS ABOUT WHAT COULD

04:07:15.654 --> 04:07:19.024 region:rollup2
BE DONE AND WHAT WE'RE ABLE TO.

04:07:17.856 --> 04:07:20.125 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENT IN CALIFORNIA

04:07:19.024 --> 04:07:21.293 region:rollup2
AND THIS WOULD USE PROPS PROPS

04:07:20.125 --> 04:07:23.896 region:rollup2
SIXTY THREE.

04:07:21.293 --> 04:07:25.331 region:rollup2
RULES.
