00:30:03.669 --> 00:30:07.039 region:rollup2
S. P. SIDE OF OF OF TWO HUNDRED

00:30:05.470 --> 00:30:08.874 region:rollup2
THIRTY THREE DOLLARS PER MONTH.

FOR MOST SENIORS AND PEOPLE

00:30:08.874 --> 00:30:11.743 region:rollup2
WITH DISABILITIES.

00:30:10.008 --> 00:30:13.045 region:rollup2
ON THAT VERY QUICKLY CAME DOWN

00:30:11.743 --> 00:30:14.746 region:rollup2
TO AROUND A HUNDRED AND FIFTY

00:30:13.045 --> 00:30:16.882 region:rollup2
SIX PER MONTH WHICH WAS THE

00:30:14.746 --> 00:30:18.717 region:rollup2
MINIMUM ALLOWED BY FEDERAL LAW

00:30:16.882 --> 00:30:20.218 region:rollup2
FOR INDIVIDUAL GRANTS. ARM AND

00:30:18.717 --> 00:30:22.587 region:rollup2
OVER THE COMING YEARS THE STATE

00:30:20.218 --> 00:30:23.522 region:rollup2
HAS PROVIDED JUST A SINGLE COST

00:30:22.587 --> 00:30:25.290 region:rollup2
OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT THAT TOOK

00:30:23.522 --> 00:30:27.693 region:rollup2
EFFECT IN EARLY TWO THOUSAND

00:30:25.290 --> 00:30:28.894 region:rollup2
SEVENTEEN AND WHICH BROUGHT. UP

00:30:27.693 --> 00:30:30.662 region:rollup2
THE GRANT LEVEL FROM A HUNDRED

00:30:28.894 --> 00:30:32.331 region:rollup2
AND FIFTY SIX DOLLARS UP TO

00:30:30.662 --> 00:30:35.100 region:rollup2
ABOUT A HUNDRED AND SIXTY ONE

00:30:32.331 --> 00:30:37.002 region:rollup2
DOLLARS SO RELATIVELY ON MODEST

00:30:35.100 --> 00:30:39.137 region:rollup2
INCREASE TO GRANT LEVELS. SO THE

00:30:37.002 --> 00:30:40.972 region:rollup2
REDLINE ABOVE THE BARS IS THE

00:30:39.137 --> 00:30:43.542 region:rollup2
FEDERAL POVERTY GUIDELINES FOR

00:30:40.972 --> 00:30:45.744 region:rollup2
EACH YEAR THAT SIMPLY INDICATES

00:30:43.542 --> 00:30:47.846 region:rollup2
THAT WHILE WE WERE FUNDING ON SS

00:30:45.744 --> 00:30:49.981 region:rollup2
I SS P. GRANTS. ARM SO THAT THEY

00:30:47.846 --> 00:30:51.550 region:rollup2
REACH THE POVERTY LINE BACK IN

00:30:49.981 --> 00:30:52.851 region:rollup2
TWO THOUSAND NINE. ARE THESE

00:30:51.550 --> 00:30:54.419 region:rollup2
GRANTS ARE CURRENTLY BEING

00:30:52.851 --> 00:30:56.088 region:rollup2
FUNDED AT A LEVEL THAT LEAVES

00:30:54.419 --> 00:30:57.923 region:rollup2
THEM AT NINETY PERCENT OF THE

00:30:56.088 --> 00:31:00.092 region:rollup2
POVERTY LINE SO BASICALLY

00:30:57.923 --> 00:31:02.094 region:rollup2
ANYBODY ON SS I SS P. EVEN IF

00:31:00.092 --> 00:31:04.429 region:rollup2
THEY RECEIVE THE MAXIMUM GRANT

00:31:02.094 --> 00:31:05.897 region:rollup2
ALLOWABLE. I'M AS AN INDIVIDUAL

00:31:04.429 --> 00:31:06.932 region:rollup2
THEIR LEFT IT NINETY PERCENT OF

00:31:05.897 --> 00:31:08.667 region:rollup2
THE POVERTY LINE ALWAYS

00:31:06.932 --> 00:31:10.602 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT POINT OUT THAT AS MANY

00:31:08.667 --> 00:31:12.170 region:rollup2
OF YOU ALREADY KNOW OUR AYE I

00:31:10.602 --> 00:31:13.305 region:rollup2
BELIEVE ALL OF YOUKNOW. THAT AS

00:31:12.170 --> 00:31:15.273 region:rollup2
A SCIENTIST HE RECIPIENTS IN

00:31:13.305 --> 00:31:17.042 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA DO NOT QUALIFY FOR

00:31:15.273 --> 00:31:18.744 region:rollup2
CAL FRESH FOOD ASSISTANCE SO THE

00:31:17.042 --> 00:31:20.579 region:rollup2
MINIMAL BASIC SUPPORT THEY

00:31:18.744 --> 00:31:21.747 region:rollup2
RECEIVE EACH MONTH NOT ONLY HAVE

00:31:20.579 --> 00:31:23.181 region:rollup2
TO HELP THEM KEEP A ROOF OVER

00:31:21.747 --> 00:31:26.151 region:rollup2
THEIR HEADS. BUT ALSO PURCHASE

00:31:23.181 --> 00:31:27.686 region:rollup2
GROCERIES MEDICINE AND OTHER

00:31:26.151 --> 00:31:30.055 region:rollup2
BASIC NECESSITIES.

00:31:27.686 --> 00:31:31.156 region:rollup2
SO IF WE MOVE ON TO SLIDE FOR

00:31:30.055 --> 00:31:32.290 region:rollup2
I'M SOME ADVOCATES HAVE

00:31:31.156 --> 00:31:34.359 region:rollup2
SUGGESTED.

00:31:32.290 --> 00:31:36.962 region:rollup2
A REASONABLE GOAL TO SET WOULD

00:31:34.359 --> 00:31:39.464 region:rollup2
BE TO RAISE EXERCISES P. GRANTS

00:31:36.962 --> 00:31:40.532 region:rollup2
BACK UP TO THE POVERTY LINE ON

00:31:39.464 --> 00:31:42.267 region:rollup2
THE FEDERAL FEDERAL POVERTY

00:31:40.532 --> 00:31:44.102 region:rollup2
GUIDELINES. I'M WHAT WOULD THAT

00:31:42.267 --> 00:31:46.204 region:rollup2
LOOK LIKE IN SHORT FORM THIS IS

00:31:44.102 --> 00:31:47.973 region:rollup2
SIMPLY TO BARS ON PAGE FOUR ONE

00:31:46.204 --> 00:31:49.007 region:rollup2
SHOWS YOU WHERE WE ARE NOW

00:31:47.973 --> 00:31:50.842 region:rollup2
RELATIVE TO THE FEDERAL POVERTY

00:31:49.007 --> 00:31:52.377 region:rollup2
GUIDELINES FOR AN INDIVIDUAL.

00:31:50.842 --> 00:31:54.346 region:rollup2
THAT THE BAR ON THE RIGHT SHOWS

00:31:52.377 --> 00:31:56.148 region:rollup2
YOU WHERE WE WOULD HAVE TO GO IN

00:31:54.346 --> 00:31:57.449 region:rollup2
ORDER TO GET GRANTS UP TO THE

00:31:56.148 --> 00:31:59.317 region:rollup2
POVERTY GUIDELINES ESSENTIALLY

00:31:57.449 --> 00:32:01.186 region:rollup2
WE HAVE DUG SUCH A DEEP HOLE IN

00:31:59.317 --> 00:32:02.821 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA. THAT WE WOULD HAVE

00:32:01.186 --> 00:32:04.489 region:rollup2
TO RAISE OUR STATE S. S. P.

00:32:02.821 --> 00:32:06.224 region:rollup2
PORTION OF THE GRANT BY JUST

00:32:04.489 --> 00:32:08.493 region:rollup2
OVER ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS PER

00:32:06.224 --> 00:32:09.895 region:rollup2
MONTH. UP FOR EACH INDIVIDUAL IN

00:32:08.493 --> 00:32:11.696 region:rollup2
THE PROGRAM WHO RECEIVED AN

00:32:09.895 --> 00:32:13.432 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL GRANT ON IN ORDER TO

00:32:11.696 --> 00:32:14.533 region:rollup2
BRING THEM UP JUST TO THE

00:32:13.432 --> 00:32:15.867 region:rollup2
POVERTY LINE.

00:32:14.533 --> 00:32:17.636 region:rollup2
AND AND YOU KNOW THAT'S A

00:32:15.867 --> 00:32:19.204 region:rollup2
RELATIVELY MODEST GOAL TO HAVE

00:32:17.636 --> 00:32:20.338 region:rollup2
TO TO BRING SOMEBODY UP TO THE

00:32:19.204 --> 00:32:22.641 region:rollup2
POVERTY LINE WERE NOT EVEN

00:32:20.338 --> 00:32:24.109 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT PUSHING THEM WELL

00:32:22.641 --> 00:32:25.977 region:rollup2
I'M OUT OF POVERTY SO.

00:32:24.109 --> 00:32:27.813 region:rollup2
THERE HAVE BEEN OTHERS WHO HAVE

00:32:25.977 --> 00:32:30.115 region:rollup2
HAD SUGGESTED THAT THAT WOULD

00:32:27.813 --> 00:32:31.750 region:rollup2
NOT BE I'M A AND IT WOULD BE A

00:32:30.115 --> 00:32:32.884 region:rollup2
RELATIVELY EXPENSIVE ENDEAVOR

00:32:31.750 --> 00:32:34.853 region:rollup2
WOULD BE DIFFICULT FOR THE STATE

00:32:32.884 --> 00:32:35.554 region:rollup2
TO DO THAT IN A SINGLE FISCAL

00:32:34.853 --> 00:32:36.755 region:rollup2
YEAR.

00:32:35.554 --> 00:32:39.691 region:rollup2
BUT IT COULD BE A GOAL THAT THE

00:32:36.755 --> 00:32:41.393 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE DECIDES TO SET THAT

00:32:39.691 --> 00:32:43.628 region:rollup2
IT WANTS TO ACHIEVE OVER TIME.

00:32:41.393 --> 00:32:45.397 region:rollup2
SO THE LAST UP YOU SLICE HERE MY

00:32:43.628 --> 00:32:47.599 region:rollup2
PRESENTATION I'M I JUST WANTED

00:32:45.397 --> 00:32:50.001 region:rollup2
TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND HOW S. P.

00:32:47.599 --> 00:32:51.102 region:rollup2
S. ISAPI GRANTS MATCH UP NOT

00:32:50.001 --> 00:32:52.370 region:rollup2
JUST TO THE FEDERAL POVERTY

00:32:51.102 --> 00:32:54.606 region:rollup2
GUIDELINES.

00:32:52.370 --> 00:32:56.174 region:rollup2
BUT TO OTHER MEASURES OF COST

00:32:54.606 --> 00:32:57.809 region:rollup2
OF LIVING AND MATERIAL WELL

00:32:56.174 --> 00:32:59.110 region:rollup2
BEING IN CALIFORNIA SO SOME OF

00:32:57.809 --> 00:33:00.579 region:rollup2
YOU MAY HAVE SEEN A FACT SHEET

00:32:59.110 --> 00:33:02.781 region:rollup2
THAT THE BUDGET CENTER RELEASED

GOVERNMENT EACH YEAR FOR HOUSING

00:33:17.095 --> 00:33:20.966 region:rollup2
ASSISTANCE PURPOSES IT'S A

00:33:18.864 --> 00:33:21.833 region:rollup2
RELATIVELY MODEST UNIT YOU'D BE

00:33:20.966 --> 00:33:23.602 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT.

00:33:21.833 --> 00:33:25.871 region:rollup2
WHAT ARE FACT SHEET SHOWED WAS

00:33:23.602 --> 00:33:29.007 region:rollup2
THAT I'M IN SEVENTEEN CALIFORNIA

00:33:25.871 --> 00:33:31.409 region:rollup2

FOR A STUDIO APARTMENT EXCEEDS

00:33:36.982 --> 00:33:39.918 region:rollup2
HALF OF THE GRANT THE REASON WE

00:33:38.650 --> 00:33:41.586 region:rollup2
PICK HALF THE GRANT IS BECAUSE

00:33:39.918 --> 00:33:43.221 region:rollup2
THAT'S SORT OF AN INDICATOR. IF

00:33:41.586 --> 00:33:44.389 region:rollup2
SOMEONE IS SPENDING HALF OR MORE

00:33:43.221 --> 00:33:45.957 region:rollup2
OF THEIR INCOME ON HOUSING

00:33:44.389 --> 00:33:47.859 region:rollup2
THEY'RE MORE LIKELY TO BE AT

00:33:45.957 --> 00:33:49.694 region:rollup2
RISK OF HOMELESSNESS SO THIS

00:33:47.859 --> 00:33:51.463 region:rollup2
CHART SIMPLY PICKS OUT FOR YOU

00:33:49.694 --> 00:33:53.164 region:rollup2
ELEVEN OF THE COUNTIES THAT WE

FEATURED IN THAT FACT SHEET. OUT

00:33:53.164 --> 00:33:55.534 region:rollup2
WHICH NOT SURPRISINGLY ARE

00:33:53.732 --> 00:33:57.769 region:rollup2

YOU KNOW AN FM ARE FOR A STUDIO

00:34:06.244 --> 00:34:08.613 region:rollup2

IN ALL CASES I'M EXCEED WHAT

00:34:13.018 --> 00:34:17.055 region:rollup2
SOMEBODY LIVING ON THIS INCOME

00:34:14.519 --> 00:34:18.590 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE EXPECTED TO PAY.

00:34:17.055 --> 00:34:20.358 region:rollup2
THE LAST THREE SLIDES IN THE

00:34:18.590 --> 00:34:21.893 region:rollup2
PRESENTATION HERE I'M MAYBE A

00:34:20.358 --> 00:34:23.628 region:rollup2
LITTLE MORE COMPLICATED TO LOOK

00:34:21.893 --> 00:34:26.164 region:rollup2
AT BUT WHAT I WANTED TO DO WAS

00:34:23.628 --> 00:34:27.899 region:rollup2
TO COMPARE THE MAXIMUM SSI SAYS

00:34:26.164 --> 00:34:29.501 region:rollup2
P. GRANT FOR AN INDIVIDUAL. TO

00:34:27.899 --> 00:34:31.369 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT LEVELS OF.

00:34:29.501 --> 00:34:33.471 region:rollup2
POVERTY THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT

00:34:31.369 --> 00:34:34.706 region:rollup2
POVERTY THRESHOLDS WE USE IN THE

00:34:33.471 --> 00:34:36.408 region:rollup2
U. S. ONE IS THE OFFICIAL

00:34:34.706 --> 00:34:37.943 region:rollup2
POVERTY THRESHOLD THAT MANY OF

00:34:36.408 --> 00:34:39.577 region:rollup2
US ARE FAMILIAR WITH. ON THE

00:34:37.943 --> 00:34:40.845 region:rollup2
OTHER IS CALLED THE SUPPLEMENTAL

00:34:39.577 --> 00:34:42.581 region:rollup2
POVERTY THRESHOLD THAT'S BEEN

00:34:40.845 --> 00:34:44.049 region:rollup2
PUBLISHED IN RECENT YEARS BY THE

00:34:42.581 --> 00:34:46.084 region:rollup2
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND TRIES TO

00:34:44.049 --> 00:34:48.586 region:rollup2
DO A BETTER JOB OF CAPTURING.

00:34:46.084 --> 00:34:51.022 region:rollup2
Y. TO FAMILY OR INDIVIDUAL

00:34:48.586 --> 00:34:52.724 region:rollup2
MIGHT NEED IN ORDER TO OUR STATE

00:34:51.022 --> 00:34:54.326 region:rollup2
SOMEWHAT MAKE ENDS MEET IN THIS

00:34:52.724 --> 00:34:55.961 region:rollup2
STATE OR IN THIS COUNTRY.

00:34:54.326 --> 00:34:58.697 region:rollup2
ANOTHER WAY OF LOOKING AT.

00:34:55.961 --> 00:35:00.031 region:rollup2
A BUDGET IS TO THINK ABOUT I'M

00:34:58.697 --> 00:35:02.901 region:rollup2
NOT JUST WHEN IS SOMEONE OUT OF

00:35:00.031 --> 00:35:04.369 region:rollup2
POVERTY BUT WHAT LEVEL OF INCOME

00:35:02.901 --> 00:35:05.904 region:rollup2
DO THEY REALLY NEED AN ORDER ON

00:35:04.369 --> 00:35:08.106 region:rollup2
TO HAVE A DECENT STANDARD OF

00:35:05.904 --> 00:35:09.407 region:rollup2
LIVING. OF THE UC I CENTER FOR

00:35:08.106 --> 00:35:10.842 region:rollup2
HEALTH POLICY RESEARCH EVERY

00:35:09.407 --> 00:35:12.611 region:rollup2
COUPLE OF YEARS PUBLISHES WHAT

00:35:10.842 --> 00:35:14.546 region:rollup2
THEY CALL THE ELDER INDEX AND

00:35:12.611 --> 00:35:17.682 region:rollup2
ESTIMATES WHAT IT COSTS ON FOR

00:35:14.546 --> 00:35:19.417 region:rollup2
AN INDIVIDUAL A SENIOR OR A YET

00:35:17.682 --> 00:35:20.785 region:rollup2
SENIORS LIVING IN ANY CALIFORNIA

00:35:19.417 --> 00:35:22.253 region:rollup2
COUNTY WHAT IT WOULD COST FOR

00:35:20.785 --> 00:35:23.688 region:rollup2
THEM TO SORT OF MAKE ENDS. MEET

00:35:22.253 --> 00:35:25.123 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF THE BUDGET SO I'VE

00:35:23.688 --> 00:35:27.626 region:rollup2
DONE ON THE NEXT THREE SLIDES

00:35:25.123 --> 00:35:29.361 region:rollup2
FOR THE FRESNO AREA OF THE SANTA

00:35:27.626 --> 00:35:31.396 region:rollup2

METROPOLITAN AREA.

00:35:33.798 --> 00:35:37.402 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD INCLUDE ANAHEIM AS

00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:39.637 region:rollup2
WELL IS TO SORT OF LAY OUT WHERE

00:35:37.402 --> 00:35:40.872 region:rollup2
THE MAXIMUM SS I SS P. GRANT FOR

00:35:39.637 --> 00:35:42.007 region:rollup2
AN INDIVIDUAL AGAIN THAT'S

00:35:40.872 --> 00:35:43.675 region:rollup2
AROUND AND NOT NINE HUNDRED

WE CAN CLEARLY SEE THAT THERE

00:42:47.965 --> 00:42:50.601 region:rollup2

PRESENTATIONS ARGUMENTS I WILL

BE BRIEF AND JUST TALK ABOUT THE

00:42:55.440 --> 00:42:58.042 region:rollup2
HIDDEN COSTS WHICH YOU'RE BOTH

00:42:56.808 --> 00:42:59.977 region:rollup2
PUBLIC AND PRIVATE.

00:42:58.042 --> 00:43:01.479 region:rollup2
ON ON THE PUBLIC SECTOR SIDE

00:42:59.977 --> 00:43:02.380 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WE FEEL JUST AS

00:43:01.479 --> 00:43:04.549 region:rollup2
STRONGLY THAT THE STATE SHOULD

00:43:02.380 --> 00:43:05.550 region:rollup2
NOT CONTINUE TO BOOK SAVINGS AND

00:43:04.549 --> 00:43:06.717 region:rollup2
AND BUILD A RESERVE AT THE

00:43:05.550 --> 00:43:08.553 region:rollup2
EXPENSE. OF.

00:43:06.717 --> 00:43:10.021 region:rollup2
RESIDENTS WHO ARE FORCED INTO

00:43:08.553 --> 00:43:11.489 region:rollup2
POVERTY BY STATE ACTION.

00:43:10.021 --> 00:43:13.624 region:rollup2
BUT ALSO THAT THERE ARE ACTUAL

00:43:11.489 --> 00:43:14.625 region:rollup2
COSTS AND THAT ARE ALWAYS BUY

00:43:13.624 --> 00:43:17.328 region:rollup2
INTO THAT THE PERSPECTIVE.

00:43:14.625 --> 00:43:18.663 region:rollup2
SO DOCTOR SELIGMAN AT UCSF FOR

00:43:17.328 --> 00:43:20.665 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE HAS SHOWN THAT

00:43:18.663 --> 00:43:22.733 region:rollup2
HOSPITALIZATIONS SPIKE IN THE

00:43:20.665 --> 00:43:24.135 region:rollup2
FOURTH WEEK OF THE MONTH FOR LOW

00:43:22.733 --> 00:43:25.736 region:rollup2
INCOME POPULATIONS.

00:43:24.135 --> 00:43:27.104 region:rollup2
AFTER FOOD BUDGETS RUN OUT

00:43:25.736 --> 00:43:28.172 region:rollup2
FOLKS CAN'T TAKE THEIR MEDICINE

00:43:27.104 --> 00:43:29.874 region:rollup2
I MEAN THERE THAT WE KNOW PEOPLE

00:43:28.172 --> 00:43:30.775 region:rollup2
ARE ALREADY SKIPPING MEALS YOU

00:43:29.874 --> 00:43:32.110 region:rollup2
KNOW AND AND MAYBE TAKE THEIR

00:43:30.775 --> 00:43:33.744 region:rollup2
MEDS AND THEY SHOULDN'T BUT WHEN

00:43:32.110 --> 00:43:34.846 region:rollup2
THOSE TYPES OF. THINGS BREAKDOWN

00:43:33.744 --> 00:43:36.247 region:rollup2
BECAUSE FOLKS SENSIBLY HAVE THE

00:43:34.846 --> 00:43:37.915 region:rollup2
RESOURCES THEY END UP IN THE

00:43:36.247 --> 00:43:38.616 region:rollup2
HOSPITAL AND THAT'S PUTTING

00:43:37.915 --> 00:43:40.551 region:rollup2
PRESSURE ON OUR HEALTHCARE

00:43:38.616 --> 00:43:42.153 region:rollup2
UTILIZATION AND WE CAN TRY TO MY

00:43:40.551 --> 00:43:43.721 region:rollup2

FURTHERMORE IT AS BEEN SPOKEN TO

00:43:43.721 --> 00:43:47.358 region:rollup2
ALREADY THERE ARE PUBLIC SAFETY

00:43:45.089 --> 00:43:48.493 region:rollup2
AND HOMELESS INTERVENTION COSTS

00:43:47.358 --> 00:43:49.861 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WHAT FOCUSED SO WE DON'T

00:43:48.493 --> 00:43:51.062 region:rollup2
HAVE THE MONEY TO LIVE IN AND OF

00:43:49.861 --> 00:43:52.263 region:rollup2
LIVING IN THEIR CARS ON THE

00:43:51.062 --> 00:43:53.564 region:rollup2
STREETS AND OTHER ACTS OF

00:43:52.263 --> 00:43:55.066 region:rollup2
DESPERATION. THAT CAN BE

00:43:53.564 --> 00:43:56.000 region:rollup2
PREVENTED IN PART OF RESTORING

00:43:55.066 --> 00:43:56.534 region:rollup2

00:43:56.534 --> 00:43:59.804 region:rollup2
COSTS.

00:43:58.169 --> 00:44:00.471 region:rollup2
BUT WHEN YOU WHEN YOU THINK

00:43:59.804 --> 00:44:02.073 region:rollup2

BECAUSE FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND.

01:14:43.012 --> 01:14:46.048 region:rollup2
EVERYONE WHO COMES HERE SHOULD

CURRENTLY IS THE ONLY STATE WITH

AS A PART OF LAST YEAR'S BUDGET

01:58:07.380 --> 01:58:09.616 region:rollup2
DELIBERATIONS ARE OFFICE WAS

01:58:08.315 --> 01:58:11.084 region:rollup2
TOSSED

TO WRITE A REPORT LOOKING AT THE

01:58:11.084 --> 01:58:13.887 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL PROGRAMMATIC AND

01:58:12.419 --> 01:58:15.655 region:rollup2
FISCAL AFFECTS OF ENDING THE

01:58:15.655 --> 01:58:19.492 region:rollup2
REPORT WE DID FACE SIGNIFICANT

01:58:17.157 --> 01:58:20.860 region:rollup2
DATA LIMITATIONS BUT LUCKILY WE

01:58:19.492 --> 01:58:22.829 region:rollup2
WERE ABLE TO RELY ON PASSED

01:58:20.860 --> 01:58:23.797 region:rollup2
ANALYSIS DONE BY MATHEMATICA AND

01:58:22.829 --> 01:58:25.665 region:rollup2
THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL

01:58:23.797 --> 01:58:26.933 region:rollup2
SERVICES TO GET A AT LEAST OF A

01:58:25.665 --> 01:58:28.868 region:rollup2
HIGH LEVEL PICTURE OF THE

01:58:26.933 --> 01:58:30.670 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL OF FACTS WHICH WE LAY

01:58:28.868 --> 01:58:31.938 region:rollup2
OUT. AND PAGE THREE MAINLY

01:58:30.670 --> 01:58:33.473 region:rollup2
THROUGH A PIE CHART AND AS YOU

01:58:31.938 --> 01:58:35.075 region:rollup2
SEE.

01:58:33.473 --> 01:58:36.910 region:rollup2
THE MAJORITY OF HOUSEHOLDS THAT

01:58:35.075 --> 01:58:39.346 region:rollup2
WOULD BE AFFECTED IT'S ESTIMATED

01:58:36.910 --> 01:58:41.214 region:rollup2
THAT THEY WOULD BENEFIT FROM AND

01:58:39.346 --> 01:58:42.682 region:rollup2
INDEED SSI CASH OUT MOST OF

01:58:41.214 --> 01:58:43.516 region:rollup2
THESE HOUSEHOLDS WOULD BENEFIT

01:58:42.682 --> 01:58:46.019 region:rollup2
IN THE FACT THAT THEY WOULD

01:58:43.516 --> 01:58:47.954 region:rollup2
BECOME. NEWLY INELIGIBLE AND

01:58:46.019 --> 01:58:50.223 region:rollup2
THEN AND ROLE IN CAL FRESH AND

01:58:47.954 --> 01:58:51.291 region:rollup2
IT'S ESTIMATED THROUGH THE

01:58:50.223 --> 01:58:52.425 region:rollup2
ESTIMATES FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:58:51.291 --> 01:58:54.527 region:rollup2
SOCIAL SERVICES THAT THEY WOULD

01:58:52.425 --> 01:58:56.730 region:rollup2
RECEIVE. ON AVERAGE SEVENTY FIVE

01:58:54.527 --> 01:58:58.732 region:rollup2
DOLLARS IN MONTHLY FOOD BENEFITS

01:58:56.730 --> 01:59:00.300 region:rollup2
HOWEVER WE WOULD NOTE THAT THERE

01:58:58.732 --> 01:59:00.834 region:rollup2
ARE SOME HOUSE SONGS THAT WOULD

01:59:00.300 --> 01:59:01.801 region:rollup2
BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY

01:59:00.834 --> 01:59:03.670 region:rollup2
ENDING%

01:59:01.801 --> 01:59:04.237 region:rollup2
THE SSI CASH ON THIS IS MAINLY

01:59:03.670 --> 01:59:05.672 region:rollup2
THROUGH THE FORM OF SEEING A

01:59:04.237 --> 01:59:06.773 region:rollup2
REDUCTION.

01:59:05.672 --> 01:59:08.608 region:rollup2
AND FOOD BENEFITS THAT THE

01:59:06.773 --> 01:59:09.709 region:rollup2
HOUSEHOLD WOULD RECEIVE MAJORITY

01:59:08.608 --> 01:59:11.411 region:rollup2
OF THOSE HOUSEHOLDS INTERNET

01:59:09.709 --> 01:59:12.545 region:rollup2
WILL BE AFFECTED AS SEEN IN THE

01:59:11.411 --> 01:59:13.947 region:rollup2
PART CHART WOULD STILL BE

01:59:12.545 --> 01:59:15.782 region:rollup2
ELIGIBLE FOR CAL FRESH BUT WOULD

01:59:13.947 --> 01:59:17.751 region:rollup2
RECEIVE A LOWER FOOD BENEFIT

01:59:15.782 --> 01:59:19.285 region:rollup2
AMOUNT. AND AGAIN IT'S EXPECTED

01:59:17.751 --> 01:59:21.287 region:rollup2
THAT THEIR FOOD BENEFITS ON

01:59:19.285 --> 01:59:23.890 region:rollup2
AVERAGE WOULD DECREASE BY EIGHTY

01:59:21.287 --> 01:59:25.925 region:rollup2
EIGHT DOLLARS A MONTH.

01:59:23.890 --> 01:59:27.127 region:rollup2
WE WOULD NOTE THAT ACROSS AND

01:59:25.925 --> 01:59:28.395 region:rollup2
THESE HOUSEHOLDS THOSE

01:59:27.127 --> 01:59:30.130 region:rollup2
HOUSEHOLDS THAT WOULD BENEFIT IN

01:59:28.395 --> 01:59:32.399 region:rollup2
THOSE HOUSEHOLDS THAT WOULD BE

01:59:30.130 --> 01:59:34.000 region:rollup2
NEGATIVELY IMPACTED. IN GENERAL

01:59:32.399 --> 01:59:35.702 region:rollup2
THOSE HOUSES THAT WOULD BENEFIT

01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:37.704 region:rollup2
TEND TO HAVE LESS INCOME THAN

01:59:35.702 --> 01:59:39.606 region:rollup2
THOSE HOUSEHOLDS THAT WOULD BE

01:59:37.704 --> 01:59:41.875 region:rollup2
NEGATIVELY AFFECTED AN OVERALL

01:59:39.606 --> 01:59:43.843 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU NET OUT THE LOSSES ON

01:59:41.875 --> 01:59:45.445 region:rollup2
THE STATEWIDE TOTAL. AND IT IS

01:59:43.843 --> 01:59:46.880 region:rollup2
EXPECTED THAT THE STATE BY

01:59:45.445 --> 01:59:48.081 region:rollup2
ENDING THE US I CASH OUT COULD

01:59:46.880 --> 01:59:49.816 region:rollup2
POTENTIALLY DRAW DOWN AN

01:59:48.081 --> 01:59:51.051 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL TWO HUNDRED FIVE

01:59:49.816 --> 01:59:53.720 region:rollup2
MILLION DOLLARS IN FEDERAL FOOD

01:59:51.051 --> 01:59:56.189 region:rollup2
BENEFITS.

01:59:53.720 --> 01:59:57.657 region:rollup2
MOVING ON TO PAGE FIVE.

01:59:56.189 --> 01:59:59.793 region:rollup2
THE S. ORAL ALSO TIME STAR

01:59:57.657 --> 02:00:01.728 region:rollup2
OFFICE AND TO LOOK AT POTENTIAL

01:59:59.793 --> 02:00:03.263 region:rollup2
OPTIONS ON FOR HOLDING

02:00:01.728 --> 02:00:04.664 region:rollup2
HOUSEHOLDS NEGATIVELY AFFECTED

02:00:03.263 --> 02:00:06.566 region:rollup2
BY AND AND YES I CASH OUT

02:00:04.664 --> 02:00:07.867 region:rollup2
HARMLESS. AND WE WOULD NOTE THAT

02:00:06.566 --> 02:00:09.569 region:rollup2
THE COST AND COMPLEXITY OF ANY

02:00:07.867 --> 02:00:11.671 region:rollup2
HOLD HARMLESS POLICY REALLY

02:00:09.569 --> 02:00:13.173 region:rollup2
VARIES ON. BASED OFF OF HOW YOU

02:00:11.671 --> 02:00:15.041 region:rollup2
STRUCTURE IT

02:00:13.173 --> 02:00:17.010 region:rollup2
I'M WE LAY OUT ME I MADE MAIN

02:00:15.041 --> 02:00:18.712 region:rollup2
FACTORS AND TO BE CONSIDERED A

02:00:17.010 --> 02:00:20.780 region:rollup2
CONSTRUCTING A HOLD HARMLESS ONE

02:00:18.712 --> 02:00:22.882 region:rollup2
BEING WHO IS ELIGIBLE. WOULD IT.

02:00:20.780 --> 02:00:24.484 region:rollup2
BE A TARGETED HOLD HARMLESS BUT

02:00:22.882 --> 02:00:26.720 region:rollup2
TARGET SPECIFIC HOUSEHOLDS BASED

02:00:24.484 --> 02:00:29.856 region:rollup2
OFF OF VARIOUS CRITERIA SUCH AS

02:00:26.720 --> 02:00:32.292 region:rollup2
NEED POVERTY HOUSEHOLD SIZE

02:00:29.856 --> 02:00:33.326 region:rollup2
WHETHER HOUSEHOLD HAS A CHILD

02:00:32.292 --> 02:00:34.894 region:rollup2
WHETHER HOUSEHOLD IS ON CAL

02:00:33.326 --> 02:00:36.730 region:rollup2
WORKS SIX CETERA OR WOULD IT BE

02:00:34.894 --> 02:00:38.898 region:rollup2
MORE EXPANSIVE APPROACH THAT

02:00:36.730 --> 02:00:39.499 region:rollup2
WOULD TRY TO CAPTURE. ALL

02:00:38.898 --> 02:00:40.433 region:rollup2
HOUSEHOLDS THAT ARE NEGATIVELY

02:00:39.499 --> 02:00:41.534 region:rollup2
HARMED.

02:00:40.433 --> 02:00:42.669 region:rollup2
I'M AND AGAIN THE MORE

02:00:41.534 --> 02:00:44.871 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS WITH KNOWLEDGE OF

02:00:42.669 --> 02:00:45.805 region:rollup2
FOR THE HOLD HARMLESS THE MORE

02:00:44.871 --> 02:00:47.774 region:rollup2
COSTLY THE HOLD HARMLESS WOULD

02:00:45.805 --> 02:00:49.476 region:rollup2
BE. ANOTHER FACTOR WOULD BE THE

02:00:47.774 --> 02:00:50.777 region:rollup2
DURATION OF THE HOLD HARMLESS

02:00:49.476 --> 02:00:52.212 region:rollup2
WOULD IT BE ISHQ A TEMPORARY

02:00:50.777 --> 02:00:53.346 region:rollup2
MORE LONG TERM PERMANENT HOLD

02:00:52.212 --> 02:00:55.515 region:rollup2
HARMLESS.

02:00:53.346 --> 02:00:56.850 region:rollup2
ANOTHER FACTOR TO CONSIDER IS

02:00:55.515 --> 02:00:58.318 region:rollup2
WHAT WOULD THE BENEFIT AMOUNT BE

02:00:56.850 --> 02:01:00.653 region:rollup2
WHAT THE HOLD HARMLESS SEEK TO

02:00:58.318 --> 02:01:02.055 region:rollup2
FULLY BACK FILL THE LOSS IN FOOD

02:01:00.653 --> 02:01:02.922 region:rollup2
BENEFITS OR WOULD IT SEEK TO

02:01:02.055 --> 02:01:04.624 region:rollup2
ONLY.

02:01:02.922 --> 02:01:07.727 region:rollup2
PARTIALLY.

02:01:04.624 --> 02:01:09.229 region:rollup2
RESTORE A THE PORTION OF THE

02:01:07.727 --> 02:01:11.131 region:rollup2
LOS FOOD BENEFITS THAT HOUSE

02:01:09.229 --> 02:01:13.433 region:rollup2
WITH MAY SEEM. AND LASTLY

02:01:11.131 --> 02:01:14.701 region:rollup2
ANOTHER FACTOR TO CONSIDER THAT

02:01:13.433 --> 02:01:15.869 region:rollup2
CONTRIBUTES TO THE COSTS IN THE

02:01:14.701 --> 02:01:18.304 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION AUTOMATION

02:01:15.869 --> 02:01:20.140 region:rollup2
COMPLEXITY OF THE OF IT ALL IS.

02:01:18.304 --> 02:01:21.107 region:rollup2
AND HOW COMPLICATED WITH THE

02:01:20.140 --> 02:01:22.575 region:rollup2
HOLD HARMLESS BE.

02:01:21.107 --> 02:01:24.010 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S REALLY INFORMED BY

02:01:22.575 --> 02:01:26.146 region:rollup2
THE THREE FACTORS WE DISCUSSED

02:01:24.010 --> 02:01:27.413 region:rollup2
ABOVE.

02:01:26.146 --> 02:01:29.349 region:rollup2
NOBODY GOING TO MORE DETAIL OF

02:01:27.413 --> 02:01:31.050 region:rollup2
THE HOLD HARMLESS POLICY OPTIONS

02:01:29.349 --> 02:01:33.019 region:rollup2
BUT. THOSE* JUST THE BIG

02:01:31.050 --> 02:01:35.288 region:rollup2
OVERVIEW NOT I'LL END MY

02:01:33.019 --> 02:01:36.890 region:rollup2
COMMENTS WITH THE QUESTIONS THAT

02:01:35.288 --> 02:01:38.858 region:rollup2
WE LAY OUT IN PAGE SEVEN WHICH

02:01:36.890 --> 02:01:40.193 region:rollup2
WE JUST IDENTIFIED AS KEY ISSUES

02:01:38.858 --> 02:01:42.195 region:rollup2
FOR LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION

02:01:40.193 --> 02:01:43.596 region:rollup2
MOVING FORWARD. ONE IS

02:01:42.195 --> 02:01:45.331 region:rollup2
DEVELOPING MORE UP TO DATE

02:01:43.596 --> 02:01:47.600 region:rollup2
ESTIMATES ON THE POTENTIAL

02:01:45.331 --> 02:01:49.269 region:rollup2
IMPACT ENDING THE SSI CASH COULD

02:01:47.600 --> 02:01:50.803 region:rollup2
HAVE ON HOUSEHOLDS IN THE STATE.

02:01:49.269 --> 02:01:52.105 region:rollup2
GIVEN THE FACT BUT SINCE DSS

02:01:50.803 --> 02:01:53.406 region:rollup2
DEVELOPED THEIR ESTIMATES AND

02:01:52.105 --> 02:01:54.974 region:rollup2
TWENTY SEVENTEEN THERE'VE BEEN A

02:01:53.406 --> 02:01:56.576 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF PROGRAMMATIC CHANGES

02:01:54.974 --> 02:01:59.646 region:rollup2
THAT MAY AFFECT THE POTENTIAL

02:01:56.576 --> 02:02:00.680 region:rollup2
IMPACT ON HOUSEHOLD SIZE THAN

02:01:59.646 --> 02:02:01.815 region:rollup2
THAT. AMOUNT OF BENEFITS THAT

02:02:00.680 --> 02:02:02.382 region:rollup2
HOW A NEWLY ELIGIBLE HOUSEHOLDS

02:02:01.815 --> 02:02:02.882 region:rollup2
COULD RECEIVE AND IT'S OUR

02:02:02.382 --> 02:02:05.685 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING THAT THE

02:02:02.882 --> 02:02:06.653 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT IS CURRENTLY WORKING

02:02:05.685 --> 02:02:07.554 region:rollup2
ON UPDATING THEIR ESTIMATES.

02:02:06.653 --> 02:02:09.422 region:rollup2
ANOTHER KEY ISSUE FOR

02:02:07.554 --> 02:02:11.024 region:rollup2
CONSIDERATION IS THE STATE

02:02:09.422 --> 02:02:12.859 region:rollup2
REALLY IDENTIFYING WAYS TO

02:02:11.024 --> 02:02:14.594 region:rollup2
MAXIMIZE CAO FRESH PARTICIPATION

02:02:12.859 --> 02:02:15.495 region:rollup2
RATE AND THIS REALLY MATTERS AND

02:02:14.594 --> 02:02:17.597 region:rollup2
WE'RE DEALING WITH THE NEWLY

02:02:15.495 --> 02:02:18.531 region:rollup2
ELIGIBLE HOUSEHOLDS BECAUSE.

02:02:17.597 --> 02:02:19.966 region:rollup2
JUST LIKE IN THE CURRENT

02:02:18.531 --> 02:02:21.534 region:rollup2
HELFRICH PROGRAM NOT ALL

02:02:19.966 --> 02:02:22.936 region:rollup2
HOUSEHOLDS THAT ARE ELIGIBLE ARE

02:02:21.534 --> 02:02:24.370 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATING IN CONFERENCE

02:02:22.936 --> 02:02:26.072 region:rollup2
THEY'RE NOT AND ROLLING. SO

02:02:24.370 --> 02:02:27.674 region:rollup2
REALLY IN THE CONTEXT OF HOW

02:02:26.072 --> 02:02:29.142 region:rollup2
DOES THE STATE MAXIMIZE THE

02:02:27.674 --> 02:02:30.877 region:rollup2
TOTAL AMOUNT OF FEDERAL FOOD

02:02:29.142 --> 02:02:32.612 region:rollup2
BENEFITS WE COULD DRAW DOWN BY

02:02:30.877 --> 02:02:34.414 region:rollup2
ENDING THE SI CASH OUT. LOOKING

02:02:32.612 --> 02:02:35.949 region:rollup2
AT WAYS TO FURTHER SIMPLIFIER

02:02:34.414 --> 02:02:37.550 region:rollup2
STREAMLINED THE APPLICATION

02:02:35.949 --> 02:02:39.385 region:rollup2
PROCESS FOR THOSE NEWLY ELIGIBLE

02:02:37.550 --> 02:02:41.487 region:rollup2
HOUSEHOLDS.

02:02:39.385 --> 02:02:43.389 region:rollup2
AND LASTLY IDENTIFYING WAYS TO

02:02:41.487 --> 02:02:44.657 region:rollup2
MITIGATE POTENTIAL AUTOMATION

02:02:43.389 --> 02:02:46.226 region:rollup2
AND ADMINISTRATIVE CHALLENGES

02:02:44.657 --> 02:02:48.061 region:rollup2
ASSOCIATED BOTH WITH ENDING THE

02:02:46.226 --> 02:02:49.662 region:rollup2
SSI CASH OUT AND ANY POTENTIAL

02:02:48.061 --> 02:02:51.130 region:rollup2
HOLD HARMLESS POLICY. IS

02:02:49.662 --> 02:02:53.166 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT THE LEGISLATURE

02:02:51.130 --> 02:02:54.033 region:rollup2
MAY SEEK TO FURTHER UNDERSTAND

02:02:53.166 --> 02:02:56.603 region:rollup2
AND THINK ABOUT.

02:02:54.033 --> 02:02:58.671 region:rollup2
AT WAYS TO MITIGATE ANY

02:02:56.603 --> 02:02:59.205 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES THAT MAY ARISE AND

02:02:58.671 --> 02:03:00.340 region:rollup2
WITHOUT HAPPY TO TAKE ANY

02:02:59.205 --> 02:03:01.241 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS.

02:03:00.340 --> 02:03:02.308 region:rollup2
THANK YOU NEXT LOVE MIKE HERALD

SO I JUST WANT TO GIVE YOU A

02:03:17.790 --> 02:03:20.727 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT OF CONTEXT I THINK

02:03:18.725 --> 02:03:22.829 region:rollup2
FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF. OF

.

02:03:24.364 --> 02:03:27.233 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW I THINK OF THIS ISSUE

02:03:25.765 --> 02:03:29.202 region:rollup2
BACK CASH OUT IT'S BEEN ON THE

02:03:27.233 --> 02:03:30.803 region:rollup2
TABLE FOR MANY MANY MANY YEARS

02:03:29.202 --> 02:03:32.205 region:rollup2
THIS IS NOT A NEW SUBJECT AND.

02:03:30.803 --> 02:03:33.606 region:rollup2
I DO FEEL LIKE.

02:03:32.205 --> 02:03:35.775 region:rollup2
WITH THE REPORT THAT WAS

02:03:33.606 --> 02:03:37.710 region:rollup2
COMMISSIONED BY THIS BODY AND

02:03:35.775 --> 02:03:40.046 region:rollup2
WAS PUT TOGETHER BY THE LA EL I

02:03:37.710 --> 02:03:42.081 region:rollup2
THINK HAS. SORT OF. RAISE THE

02:03:40.046 --> 02:03:43.716 region:rollup2
GAME IF YOU WILL ABOUT. WHETHER

02:03:42.081 --> 02:03:45.418 region:rollup2
OR NOT THIS IS THE TIME TO BE

02:03:43.716 --> 02:03:47.220 region:rollup2
REALLY MOVING FORWARD ON ANY

02:03:45.418 --> 02:03:49.222 region:rollup2
CASH OUT AND GETTING. A SNAP

02:03:47.220 --> 02:03:50.690 region:rollup2
BENEFITS TO RECIPIENTS ANDI

02:03:49.222 --> 02:03:52.825 region:rollup2
WANT TO JUST SAY THAT WHEN YOU

02:03:50.690 --> 02:03:54.260 region:rollup2
TALK TO RECIPIENTS ACROSS THE

02:03:52.825 --> 02:03:54.827 region:rollup2
BOARD YOU HEARD MANY OF THEM

02:03:54.260 --> 02:03:55.795 region:rollup2
TESTIFIED JUST A FEW MINUTES

02:03:54.827 --> 02:03:58.631 region:rollup2
AGO.

02:03:55.795 --> 02:03:59.832 region:rollup2
THEY REALLY WANT SNAP BENEFITS

02:03:58.631 --> 02:04:01.434 region:rollup2
AND THEY KNOW WHY TO BECAUSE.

02:03:59.832 --> 02:04:02.302 region:rollup2
NGUYEN SNAPPERS INCOME THAT

02:04:01.434 --> 02:04:03.870 region:rollup2
CAN'T BE TAKEN AWAY BY RENT

02:04:02.302 --> 02:04:05.338 region:rollup2
INCREASES

02:04:03.870 --> 02:04:06.706 region:rollup2
STAYS AND WITH THEM IT'S

02:04:05.338 --> 02:04:08.174 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT PROTECTS THEM

02:04:06.706 --> 02:04:09.909 region:rollup2
ALLOWS HIM TO HAVE THAT FOOD

02:04:08.174 --> 02:04:11.010 region:rollup2
THAT THEY. ARE RIGHT NOW HAVING

02:04:09.909 --> 02:04:12.679 region:rollup2
TO GO TO SO MANY THE FOOD BANKS

02:04:11.010 --> 02:04:14.314 region:rollup2
AND OTHER FOOD PANTRIES TO GET

02:04:12.679 --> 02:04:15.682 region:rollup2
ASSISTANCE FOR. BUT WHEN WE'VE

02:04:14.314 --> 02:04:17.383 region:rollup2
SPOKEN WITH CLIENTS THAT WANT TO

02:04:15.682 --> 02:04:18.685 region:rollup2
BE REALLY CLEAR WE SHARED WITH

02:04:17.383 --> 02:04:20.720 region:rollup2
HIM THE RESULTS OF THE ALLEY ó

02:04:18.685 --> 02:04:22.088 region:rollup2
REPORT AND SHOWED HIM THAT THERE

02:04:20.720 --> 02:04:23.456 region:rollup2
WERE GOING TO BE A SIGNIFICANT

02:04:22.088 --> 02:04:24.691 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF FAMILIES WHO WERE

02:04:23.456 --> 02:04:27.460 region:rollup2
GOING TO LOSE BENEFITS.

02:04:24.691 --> 02:04:29.028 region:rollup2
THEY WERE LIKE NO WE DON'T WANT

02:04:27.460 --> 02:04:30.263 region:rollup2
IT TO END CASH OUT ON THE BACKS

02:04:29.028 --> 02:04:32.532 region:rollup2
OF OTHER PEOPLE.

02:04:30.263 --> 02:04:34.867 region:rollup2
THIS HAS TO BE DONE IN A WAY IN

02:04:32.532 --> 02:04:36.169 region:rollup2
WHICH EVERYONE GETS TO KEEP

02:04:34.867 --> 02:04:37.570 region:rollup2
THEIR BENEFITS IF THEY ARE

02:04:36.169 --> 02:04:40.039 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY GETTING THEM WE DON'T

02:04:37.570 --> 02:04:42.241 region:rollup2
WANNA HURT ANYBODY. YES WE WANT

02:04:40.039 --> 02:04:42.909 region:rollup2
TO GET OUR SNAP BENEFITS AND WE

02:04:42.241 --> 02:04:44.777 region:rollup2
THINK THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO

02:04:42.909 --> 02:04:46.946 region:rollup2
DO BUT WE HAVE TO FIGUREOUT A

02:04:44.777 --> 02:04:48.247 region:rollup2
WAY TO DO THIS IN A WAY WHERE IN

02:04:46.946 --> 02:04:50.149 region:rollup2
WHICH WE DON'T HARM FAMILIES WHO

02:04:48.247 --> 02:04:51.484 region:rollup2
WERE LIVING IN POVERTY ALSO. SO

02:04:50.149 --> 02:04:53.319 region:rollup2
I'D I THINK THERE WAS THERE'S

02:04:51.484 --> 02:04:54.721 region:rollup2
SOMETHING QUITE NOBLE ABOUT THAT

02:04:53.319 --> 02:04:56.289 region:rollup2
AND I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT.

02:04:54.721 --> 02:04:57.390 region:rollup2
ALL OF US WHO WERE WORKING UP

02:04:56.289 --> 02:04:58.725 region:rollup2
HERE IN THE CAPITAL NEED TO TAKE

02:04:57.390 --> 02:04:59.993 region:rollup2
NOTE OF AND REALLY TRY TO

02:04:58.725 --> 02:05:00.960 region:rollup2
ENDEAVOR AND MOVE TOWARDS.

02:04:59.993 --> 02:05:03.229 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW.

02:05:00.960 --> 02:05:05.031 region:rollup2
.

02:05:03.229 --> 02:05:06.399 region:rollup2
.

02:05:05.031 --> 02:05:08.601 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WE FEEL LIKE WE'RE AT

02:05:06.399 --> 02:05:10.603 region:rollup2
THIS POINT NOW WHERE WE MUST

02:05:08.601 --> 02:05:11.771 region:rollup2
MOVE BEYOND. YOU KNOW LET'S

02:05:10.603 --> 02:05:13.239 region:rollup2
COULD PRODUCE ANOTHER REPORT

02:05:11.771 --> 02:05:15.007 region:rollup2
LET'S.

02:05:13.239 --> 02:05:16.175 region:rollup2
LET'S THINK ABOUT IT SOME MORE

02:05:15.007 --> 02:05:18.644 region:rollup2
AND WE NEED TO MOVE TOMORE OF

02:05:16.175 --> 02:05:20.747 region:rollup2
AN ACTION ORIENTED APPROACH. AND

02:05:18.644 --> 02:05:22.915 region:rollup2
SO WHAT WE ARE RECOMMENDING FOR

02:05:20.747 --> 02:05:25.151 region:rollup2
THE SUBCOMMITTEE IS TO DIRECT

02:05:22.915 --> 02:05:26.085 region:rollup2
THE DEPARTMENT. OF AND THE

02:05:25.151 --> 02:05:28.454 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT FINANCE AND PARTLY SO

02:05:26.085 --> 02:05:29.989 region:rollup2
SERVICE THAT IS TO WORK WITH US

02:05:28.454 --> 02:05:32.191 region:rollup2
WORK WITH ALEJO AND OTHERS TO

02:05:29.989 --> 02:05:33.760 region:rollup2
TRY TO REALLY DIG DOWN INTO SOME

02:05:32.191 --> 02:05:35.061 region:rollup2
OF THE QUESTIONS THAT HAVE JUST

02:05:33.760 --> 02:05:36.696 region:rollup2
BEEN RAISED BY THE LA GO.

02:05:35.061 --> 02:05:38.998 region:rollup2
BY THE TIME THE MAY REVISE AND

02:05:36.696 --> 02:05:39.899 region:rollup2
GIVE THIS COMMITTEE AND THE

02:05:38.998 --> 02:05:40.566 region:rollup2
OTHER THIS OTHER COMMITTEE IN

02:05:39.899 --> 02:05:42.301 region:rollup2
YOUR.

02:05:40.566 --> 02:05:43.836 region:rollup2
COUNTERPART IN THE SENATE

02:05:42.301 --> 02:05:45.004 region:rollup2
INFORMATION ON A NUMBER OF KEY

02:05:43.836 --> 02:05:46.039 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS WHICH WE THINK WE NEED

02:05:45.004 --> 02:05:48.508 region:rollup2
TO GET ADDRESS.

02:05:46.039 --> 02:05:49.776 region:rollup2
ONE WE WE WE THINK THAT APART WE

02:05:48.508 --> 02:05:51.978 region:rollup2
WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT APARTMENT

02:05:49.776 --> 02:05:53.780 region:rollup2
COMEBACK TO THE LEGISLATURE INTO

02:05:51.978 --> 02:05:56.716 region:rollup2
ADVOCATES AND STAKEHOLDERS WITH.

02:05:53.780 --> 02:05:58.051 region:rollup2
SOME OPTIONS FOR HOLD HARMLESS

02:05:56.716 --> 02:05:59.652 region:rollup2
WHAT WOULD HOW WOULD THEY WORK

02:05:58.051 --> 02:06:01.521 region:rollup2
WHAT WOULD BE THE COST OF THEM

02:05:59.652 --> 02:06:03.289 region:rollup2
WHAT WOULD BE THE WAYS THAT

02:06:01.521 --> 02:06:04.323 region:rollup2
WE'VE DELIVER THAT BENEFIT TO

02:06:03.289 --> 02:06:06.025 region:rollup2
PERSONS AND WHAT ARE THE TRADE

02:06:04.323 --> 02:06:08.494 region:rollup2
OFFS. OF USING ONE DELIVERY

02:06:06.025 --> 02:06:09.529 region:rollup2
SYSTEM OVER ANOTHER ONE AND WHAT

02:06:08.494 --> 02:06:11.030 region:rollup2
ARE THE COSTS THAT MIGHT BE

02:06:09.529 --> 02:06:11.831 region:rollup2
IMPLICATED FROM THOSE VERY STE

02:06:11.030 --> 02:06:14.033 region:rollup2
DELIVERY SYSTEMS AND

02:06:11.831 --> 02:06:16.369 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGIES WITH AFTER. HAVE.

02:06:14.033 --> 02:06:19.038 region:rollup2
SECONDLY WE THINK THAT THERE

02:06:16.369 --> 02:06:21.574 region:rollup2
NEEDS TO BE A PLAN FOR HOW WE'RE

02:06:19.038 --> 02:06:23.476 region:rollup2
GOING TO DO TWO THINGS ONE HOW

02:06:21.574 --> 02:06:24.043 region:rollup2
DO WE IN ROLE PEOPLE WHO ARE

02:06:23.476 --> 02:06:25.445 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY SSI RECIPIENTS BUT

02:06:24.043 --> 02:06:28.147 region:rollup2
NOT.

02:06:25.445 --> 02:06:30.149 region:rollup2
IN SNAP WHAT IS THE ROLL OUT

02:06:28.147 --> 02:06:32.452 region:rollup2
PLAN MUCH AS WE DID WITH COVERED

02:06:30.149 --> 02:06:34.887 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA WHEN WE HAD THE ACA

02:06:32.452 --> 02:06:37.156 region:rollup2
THE STATE HAD TO DEVELOP A VERY.

02:06:34.887 --> 02:06:38.825 region:rollup2
SOPHISTICATED AND SMART PLAN

02:06:37.156 --> 02:06:41.327 region:rollup2
AND WE KNOW HOW TO DO THIS THE

02:06:38.825 --> 02:06:42.562 region:rollup2
STATE IS REALLY GOOD AT IT BUT

02:06:41.327 --> 02:06:43.863 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO HAVE THAT PLANET

02:06:42.562 --> 02:06:44.831 region:rollup2
NEEDS TO BE THOUGHT THROUGH AND

02:06:43.863 --> 02:06:46.365 region:rollup2
I WOULD SUGGEST THIS COMMITTEE

02:06:44.831 --> 02:06:48.434 region:rollup2
NEEDS TO KNOW WHAT THE COST OF

02:06:46.365 --> 02:06:49.368 region:rollup2
THAT'S GOING TO BE. SO THAT WE

02:06:48.434 --> 02:06:51.037 region:rollup2
DO IT EFFECTIVELY AND QUICKLY.

02:06:49.368 --> 02:06:53.339 region:rollup2
AND THEN THIRD.

02:06:51.037 --> 02:06:55.208 region:rollup2
WE WOULD THINK THAT THE

02:06:53.339 --> 02:06:57.210 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE IN OURSELVES WOULD

02:06:55.208 --> 02:06:59.479 region:rollup2
LIKE TO KNOW WHAT ALL THE LEGAL

02:06:57.210 --> 02:07:01.848 region:rollup2
STEPS IN TIME LINES ARE TO

02:06:59.479 --> 02:07:03.382 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT THIS POLICY.

02:07:01.848 --> 02:07:04.617 region:rollup2
WHAT'S REQUIRED FROM THE FEDERAL

02:07:03.382 --> 02:07:06.252 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT IS TERMS OF

02:07:04.617 --> 02:07:08.421 region:rollup2
PERMISSION IF SUCH A THING IS

02:07:06.252 --> 02:07:10.189 region:rollup2
REQUIRED WHAT WAIVERS WITH THE

02:07:08.421 --> 02:07:11.591 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT NEED TO SEEK IN WHAT

02:07:10.189 --> 02:07:12.692 region:rollup2
WOULD BE THE TIMELINE. FOR

02:07:11.591 --> 02:07:14.060 region:rollup2
SEEKING THOSE IN GETTING THOSE

02:07:12.692 --> 02:07:15.528 region:rollup2
BACK.

02:07:14.060 --> 02:07:17.930 region:rollup2
AND THEN I THINK.

02:07:15.528 --> 02:07:19.899 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW HAVING ALL THAT

02:07:17.930 --> 02:07:21.734 region:rollup2
INFORMATION IN HAND.

02:07:19.899 --> 02:07:23.402 region:rollup2
THEN I THINK IT WOULD BE.

02:07:21.734 --> 02:07:24.804 region:rollup2
MORE POSSIBLE FOR US TO ARRIVE

02:07:23.402 --> 02:07:25.938 region:rollup2
AT A DECISION ABOUT WHETHER NOT

02:07:24.804 --> 02:07:27.607 region:rollup2
WE WANT TO MOVE FORWARD WITH

02:07:25.938 --> 02:07:29.342 region:rollup2
ENDING CASH OUT OR NOT.

02:07:27.607 --> 02:07:31.043 region:rollup2
AND I WANT TO UNDERSCORE AGAIN

02:07:29.342 --> 02:07:32.211 region:rollup2
THE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE HOLD

02:07:31.043 --> 02:07:33.579 region:rollup2
HARMLESS PROVISIONS ARE REALLY

02:07:32.211 --> 02:07:36.282 region:rollup2
CRITICAL.

02:07:33.579 --> 02:07:38.251 region:rollup2
WE IF WE CAN ARRIVE IT I THINK

02:07:36.282 --> 02:07:39.952 region:rollup2
A COMPROMISE AMONG ALL THE

02:07:38.251 --> 02:07:41.888 region:rollup2
PARTIES ON THIS.

02:07:39.952 --> 02:07:43.189 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD BE REALLY SOMETHING

02:07:41.888 --> 02:07:44.590 region:rollup2
SPECIAL AND I THINK IT'S

02:07:43.189 --> 02:07:45.525 region:rollup2
SOMETHING TO REALLY STRIVE FOR

02:07:44.590 --> 02:07:46.759 region:rollup2
IF WE CAN GET IT DONE IN THIS

02:07:45.525 --> 02:07:48.594 region:rollup2
YEAR'S BUDGET.

02:07:46.759 --> 02:07:50.296 region:rollup2
IF NOT I THINK WE AT LEAST HAVE

02:07:48.594 --> 02:07:51.864 region:rollup2
A GAME PLAN SET DOWN WE WILL

02:07:50.296 --> 02:07:54.167 region:rollup2
KNOW WHAT ALL THE ANSWERS ARE

02:07:51.864 --> 02:07:56.502 region:rollup2
ALL THE STEPS ARE EVERYTHING IF

02:07:54.167 --> 02:07:58.538 region:rollup2
WE CHOOSE IN THE FUTURE. TO MOVE

02:07:56.502 --> 02:08:01.407 region:rollup2
ON ENDING CASH OUT WE WILL BE

02:07:58.538 --> 02:08:02.041 region:rollup2
FARTHER MUCH FURTHER ADVANCED IN

02:08:01.407 --> 02:08:02.909 region:rollup2
ACHIEVING THAT GOAL IN THE TIME

02:08:02.041 --> 02:08:04.310 region:rollup2
COMES.

02:08:02.909 --> 02:08:05.711 region:rollup2
FOR NOW THOUGH I THINK WE ARE

02:08:04.310 --> 02:08:07.547 region:rollup2
TO KEEP OUR.

02:08:05.711 --> 02:08:08.814 region:rollup2
FOOT TO THE PANEL.

02:08:07.547 --> 02:08:09.916 region:rollup2
IN THE NEXT COUPLE MONTHS AND

02:08:08.814 --> 02:08:11.150 region:rollup2
TRY TO SEE HOW FAR WE CAN GET

02:08:09.916 --> 02:08:13.019 region:rollup2
AND.

02:08:11.150 --> 02:08:14.954 region:rollup2
SEE IF THIS IS THE YEAR THAT WE

02:08:13.019 --> 02:08:16.322 region:rollup2
CAN FINALLY BEGIN TO END CASH

02:08:14.954 --> 02:08:17.857 region:rollup2
OUT IN CALIFORNIA AND JOIN THE

02:08:16.322 --> 02:08:19.325 region:rollup2

GOD WANTS US TO TREAT EACH OTHER

02:09:40.373 --> 02:09:42.942 region:rollup2
EQUALLY AT LEAST THAT'S WHAT I

WAS TAUGHT WHEN I WAS GROWING

02:09:42.942 --> 02:09:46.145 region:rollup2

BUT THERE'S A LOT OF ADVANTAGE I

02:16:19.171 --> 02:16:22.741 region:rollup2
THINK POTENTIALLY AS WE CONSIDER

02:16:21.440 --> 02:16:23.275 region:rollup2
THE.

02:16:22.741 --> 02:16:24.343 region:rollup2

TWO LOOKING PARTICULARLY AT THE

02:16:26.278 --> 02:16:31.316 region:rollup2
END OF THE ADVANTAGE OF. ENDING

02:16:28.747 --> 02:16:33.152 region:rollup2
CASTRO DOING CASH AND WHATEVER.

02:16:31.316 --> 02:16:35.054 region:rollup2
HOME CERTAINLY THE ARMED

02:16:33.152 --> 02:16:36.555 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT IS.

02:16:35.054 --> 02:16:38.023 region:rollup2
ABSOLUTELY WILLING AND READY TO.

02:16:36.555 --> 02:16:38.991 region:rollup2
PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE

02:16:38.023 --> 02:16:41.693 region:rollup2
WORK WITH WORK GROUPS AT CENTER

TO BRING. INFORMATION BACK THE

02:16:41.693 --> 02:16:44.229 region:rollup2
WATERS.

02:16:43.095 --> 02:16:46.065 region:rollup2
CLEARLY I MEAN NEVER INSIDE IT

02:16:44.229 --> 02:16:47.833 region:rollup2
IMPEDED THE CONVERSATION TO THIS

02:16:46.065 --> 02:16:49.268 region:rollup2
POINT IS THE FACT THAT THERE ARE

02:16:47.833 --> 02:16:51.804 region:rollup2
WINNERS AND THE LOSERS.

02:16:49.268 --> 02:16:52.805 region:rollup2
AND HOW WE CAL IN NEVADA I DON'T

02:16:51.804 --> 02:16:53.272 region:rollup2
THINK THEY WOULD CARE ABOUT THE

02:16:52.805 --> 02:16:55.674 region:rollup2
LOSERS FRANKLY THAT.

02:16:53.272 --> 02:16:57.309 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW JUST.

02:16:55.674 --> 02:16:58.343 region:rollup2
GIVEN YOU DON'T GIVEN TO THE

02:16:57.309 --> 02:16:59.645 region:rollup2
FIRST PERSON IN PARLIAMENT AND

02:16:58.343 --> 02:17:01.747 region:rollup2
PRESSURE.

02:16:59.645 --> 02:17:03.782 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA WE DON'T DO THAT SO

02:17:01.747 --> 02:17:07.319 region:rollup2
SOMEHOW WE HAVE TO CALIBRATE.

02:17:03.782 --> 02:17:08.487 region:rollup2
HOW WE MITIGATE THE IMPACT ON?

02:17:07.319 --> 02:17:10.789 region:rollup2
THE LOSERS PEOPLE WHO WOULD

02:17:08.487 --> 02:17:12.658 region:rollup2
COULD NOT BE ADVANTAGE BY THIS.

02:17:10.789 --> 02:17:14.326 region:rollup2
AND REALISTICALLY I THINK WE

02:17:12.658 --> 02:17:16.161 region:rollup2
WOULD MAKE A MISTAKE TO LOWBALL

02:17:14.326 --> 02:17:19.431 region:rollup2
THE ESTIMATES TO SAY WHAT'S MORE

02:17:16.161 --> 02:17:20.332 region:rollup2
THAN THAT. TRUTHFULLY THE.

02:17:19.431 --> 02:17:21.533 region:rollup2
CONSTITUENCIES WOULD BE

02:17:20.332 --> 02:17:23.736 region:rollup2
NEGATIVELY AFFECTED WILL BE HERE

02:17:21.533 --> 02:17:24.303 region:rollup2
NEXT YOU KNOW NEXT YEAR LET'S BE

02:17:23.736 --> 02:17:26.205 region:rollup2
UP FRONT MATURE ABOUT IT AND

02:17:24.303 --> 02:17:28.207 region:rollup2

THE REASON THAT THEY LIKE THAT

02:45:04.361 --> 02:45:07.030 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY GO INTO A

02:45:05.896 --> 02:45:08.398 region:rollup2

02:45:14.905 --> 02:45:18.041 region:rollup2
ABILITY TO TRY SOMETHING NEW.

02:45:16.507 --> 02:45:19.743 region:rollup2

THIS US FAR TO HELP TRY AND

03:01:59.742 --> 03:02:04.046 region:rollup2
START ALLEVIATING SOME OF THE

03:02:02.078 --> 03:02:05.481 region:rollup2
FEARS AND CONCERNS THAT.

03:02:04.046 --> 03:02:07.784 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS ARE HAVING.

03:02:05.481 --> 03:02:10.119 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I WAS.

I STARTED. ON.

03:02:10.119 --> 03:02:12.889 region:rollup2
THAT IT IS A VERY IMPORTANT THAT

03:02:12.121 --> 03:02:15.391 region:rollup2

03:02:12.889 --> 03:02:17.093 region:rollup2
DELIBERATE AND LISTENING

03:02:15.391 --> 03:02:19.262 region:rollup2
APPROACH TO THIS.

03:02:17.093 --> 03:02:22.632 region:rollup2
THAT ACTUALLY A PART OF THE

03:02:19.262 --> 03:02:25.501 region:rollup2
STATUTE DOES SAY THAT IT IS TO

03:02:22.632 --> 03:02:27.036 region:rollup2
BE INVOLVING STAKEHOLDERS AND

03:02:25.501 --> 03:02:30.406 region:rollup2
THAT IT IS TO.

DO THE LEAST CUMBERSOME PROCESS

03:02:30.406 --> 03:02:34.210 region:rollup2
AND WE TAKE THAT VERY SERIOUSLY

03:02:32.375 --> 03:02:36.179 region:rollup2
AND WE LOOK AT OUT THAT AS THE

03:02:34.210 --> 03:02:37.313 region:rollup2
CORE OF OUR APPROACH TO THIS AND

03:02:36.179 --> 03:02:39.682 region:rollup2
KNOWING THAT.

03:02:37.313 --> 03:02:41.751 region:rollup2

KNOW THAT TO DO THAT IN

03:02:45.021 --> 03:02:48.624 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA IS IS NOT POSSIBLE.

03:02:47.490 --> 03:02:51.461 region:rollup2

FAITH EXTENSIONS SO THAT WE CAN

03:02:53.729 --> 03:02:57.667 region:rollup2
DO THIS CORRECTLY AND THAT WE

03:02:55.832 --> 03:02:58.868 region:rollup2

THAT WE NEED TO AND HOW WE

03:03:02.138 --> 03:03:05.408 region:rollup2
APPROACH THIS.

03:03:04.273 --> 03:03:07.109 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT WE

03:03:05.408 --> 03:03:08.978 region:rollup2
TALKED ABOUT DURING THAT

03:03:07.109 --> 03:03:11.747 region:rollup2

ONE OF THE FEARS THAT CAME UP.

03:03:27.730 --> 03:03:32.068 region:rollup2
LAST FALL WAS THE CONCERN ABOUT

03:03:30.900 --> 03:03:35.104 region:rollup2

THAT PEOPLE CONTINUE TO BE ABLE

03:03:55.157 --> 03:03:58.494 region:rollup2
TO RECEIVE SERVICES WHERE THEY

03:03:57.260 --> 03:04:00.263 region:rollup2
NEED THEM IF THEY'RE OUT IN THE

03:03:58.494 --> 03:04:02.198 region:rollup2

HAVING TO CHECK IN AND CHECK OUT

03:04:19.382 --> 03:04:23.286 region:rollup2

IT'S GPS IS NOT A REQUIREMENT

03:04:47.009 --> 03:04:51.847 region:rollup2
OF EBV AND THE STATE DOES NOT

03:04:48.911 --> 03:04:54.617 region:rollup2
INTEND TO UTILIZE THAT AS AN

03:04:51.847 --> 03:04:55.818 region:rollup2

TAKEN OUT OF PLACE AS CONSUMERS

03:09:57.720 --> 03:10:00.089 region:rollup2

TOWARD TO BE SUCCESSFUL I THINK

03:10:14.603 --> 03:10:19.208 region:rollup2
IT NEEDS TO BE BROUGHT DOWN TO A

03:10:16.939 --> 03:10:21.744 region:rollup2
SMALLER GROUP OF CONSUMERS AND

03:10:19.208 --> 03:10:26.916 region:rollup2

STATE SO I THINK THERE IS.

03:51:57.570 --> 03:52:02.075 region:rollup2
SOME REAL CAUSE FOR CONCERN.

03:52:00.140 --> 03:52:04.244 region:rollup2
HOW THOSE STATES HAVE

03:52:02.075 --> 03:52:06.112 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTED BUT IMPORTANTLY IT'S

03:52:04.244 --> 03:52:08.148 region:rollup2
AN OPPORTUNITY I THINK FOR

03:52:06.112 --> 03:52:08.948 region:rollup2
LESSONS LEARNED ON THE DIRECTION

03:52:08.148 --> 03:52:11.551 region:rollup2
THAT?

03:52:08.948 --> 03:52:13.186 region:rollup2
THAT WE SHOULDN'T BE GOING.

03:52:11.551 --> 03:52:14.921 region:rollup2
I WOULD LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE

03:52:13.186 --> 03:52:17.557 region:rollup2

THEY'RE THOUGHTFUL APPROACH.

03:52:18.358 --> 03:52:22.829 region:rollup2
THAT THEY'VE UTILIZED THUS FAR

03:52:20.426 --> 03:52:25.532 region:rollup2

CANDIDLY I THINK COMING FORWARD

03:52:28.535 --> 03:52:32.472 region:rollup2
WITH I I THINK SOME OF THE

03:52:30.637 --> 03:52:34.474 region:rollup2
SOLUTIONS THAT THEY'VE SUGGESTED

03:52:32.472 --> 03:52:34.974 region:rollup2
ARE OFF THE TABLE THAT WE

03:52:34.474 --> 03:52:35.842 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO

03:52:34.974 --> 03:52:37.977 region:rollup2
REPLICATE.

03:52:35.842 --> 03:52:39.746 region:rollup2
FROM THOSE OTHER STATES SO WE

03:52:37.977 --> 03:52:41.648 region:rollup2

AS WE GO FORWARD ON.

03:52:45.685 --> 03:52:49.622 region:rollup2
ON AND IMPLEMENTATION UNLESS

03:52:47.854 --> 03:52:50.490 region:rollup2
THERE IS ANOTHER ALTERNATIVE

03:52:49.622 --> 03:52:57.030 region:rollup2

WITHOUT GROWING EACH WEEK SO

04:05:13.966 --> 04:05:16.802 region:rollup2
WE'RE VERY PLEASED ABOUT THAT WE

04:05:15.334 --> 04:05:18.737 region:rollup2

FAR AS.

04:05:24.977 --> 04:05:28.814 region:rollup2

REALLY CAN GET PAYMENTS TO

04:05:39.325 --> 04:05:42.394 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WITHIN TWO OR THREE DAYS

04:05:40.859 --> 04:05:44.897 region:rollup2
AND THAT HAS BEEN A VERY

04:05:42.394 --> 04:05:47.099 region:rollup2
POSITIVE POSITIVE OUTCOME AS

ACCRUED AND PROBABLY WHEN IT CAN

04:06:25.271 --> 04:06:28.707 region:rollup2
BE USED.

04:06:26.105 --> 04:06:31.043 region:rollup2

SO THAT'S GOING TO BE.

04:06:38.984 --> 04:06:45.224 region:rollup2
ONGOING DISCUSSION.

04:06:42.021 --> 04:06:46.992 region:rollup2

04:07:11.650 --> 04:07:13.719 region:rollup2
SEVERAL ISSUES THAT I'D LIKE TO

04:07:13.485 --> 04:07:17.222 region:rollup2
RAISE.

04:07:13.719 --> 04:07:18.724 region:rollup2
FIRST OFF IS IT AND WE ASK THAT

04:07:17.222 --> 04:07:19.491 region:rollup2
THIS BE AGENDA IS AN AND ARE

VERY.

04:07:19.491 --> 04:07:22.828 region:rollup2
THANKFUL THAT IT WAS A GEN DIS

04:07:21.627 --> 04:07:23.162 region:rollup2
THIS HAS TO DO WITH THE SEVEN

04:07:22.828 --> 04:07:26.332 region:rollup2
PERCENT CUT.

04:07:23.162 --> 04:07:28.067 region:rollup2
.

04:07:26.332 --> 04:07:30.069 region:rollup2
THEY WE NEED TO BE TALKING ABOUT

04:07:28.067 --> 04:07:32.504 region:rollup2
RESTORING THE CUT ONCE AND FOR

04:07:30.069 --> 04:07:33.972 region:rollup2
ALL AND AS WE ALL KNOW RIGHT NOW

04:07:32.504 --> 04:07:35.841 region:rollup2
IT'S RESTORATION AND IS

04:07:33.972 --> 04:07:38.243 region:rollup2
DEPENDENT ON.

04:07:35.841 --> 04:07:39.678 region:rollup2
THE MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATION

04:07:38.243 --> 04:07:43.816 region:rollup2
TAX BEING IN A FACT.

04:07:39.678 --> 04:07:44.950 region:rollup2
WHICH IT DOES EXPIRE NEXT YEAR

04:07:43.816 --> 04:07:45.617 region:rollup2
WE KNOW THAT WE NEED FEDERAL

04:07:44.950 --> 04:07:46.985 region:rollup2
APPROVAL FOR THAT AND SO TAX TO

04:07:45.617 --> 04:07:49.421 region:rollup2
CONTINUE.

04:07:46.985 --> 04:07:51.924 region:rollup2
THE LA OLA ITSELF ACKNOWLEDGE

04:07:49.421 --> 04:07:53.092 region:rollup2
THAT FEDERAL APPROVAL WAS

04:07:51.924 --> 04:07:56.362 region:rollup2
UNCERTAIN AT THIS POINT.

04:07:53.092 --> 04:07:57.896 region:rollup2
SO IF IT DOESN'T HAPPEN THEN

04:07:56.362 --> 04:07:59.465 region:rollup2
THIS SEVEN PERCENT CUT

04:07:57.896 --> 04:08:01.333 region:rollup2
AUTOMATICALLY GOES BACK INTO

04:07:59.465 --> 04:08:02.668 region:rollup2
PLEASE AND.

04:08:01.333 --> 04:08:03.869 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THAT THAT COAT CAME

04:08:02.668 --> 04:08:06.472 region:rollup2
ABOUT AS A RESULT OF THE

04:08:03.869 --> 04:08:08.340 region:rollup2
RECESSION. AND AS OTHER.

04:08:06.472 --> 04:08:10.609 region:rollup2
FOLKS HAVE TESTIFIED REGARDING

04:08:08.340 --> 04:08:12.411 region:rollup2
OTHERS SERVICES AND BENEFITS

04:08:10.609 --> 04:08:13.979 region:rollup2
ATTA AT A TIME WHERE THE

04:08:12.411 --> 04:08:16.115 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR IS SEEKING TO PUT. THE

04:08:13.979 --> 04:08:17.349 region:rollup2
MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE AMOUNT IN THE

04:08:16.115 --> 04:08:20.018 region:rollup2
RAINY DAY FUND.

04:08:17.349 --> 04:08:21.120 region:rollup2
IT IS NOT RIGHT TO BE DOING THAT

04:08:20.018 --> 04:08:22.888 region:rollup2
WHEN THERE ARE SERVICES THAT

04:08:21.120 --> 04:08:24.423 region:rollup2
HAVEN'T BEEN RESTORED GOING BACK

04:08:22.888 --> 04:08:27.493 region:rollup2
TO THE RECESSION.

04:08:24.423 --> 04:08:29.428 region:rollup2
AND THIS CUT NEEDS TO BE STRUCK

04:08:27.493 --> 04:08:31.163 region:rollup2
FROM CURRENT LAW IN OUR OPINION.

04:08:29.428 --> 04:08:32.898 region:rollup2
I.

04:08:31.163 --> 04:08:35.200 region:rollup2
WE SHOULD BE TALKING ABOUT THIS

04:08:32.898 --> 04:08:36.268 region:rollup2
NOW WHILE TIMES ARE GOOD AND NOT

04:08:35.200 --> 04:08:37.936 region:rollup2
NEXT YEAR WHEN WE ARE IN A

04:08:36.268 --> 04:08:40.406 region:rollup2
CRISIS MODE.

04:08:37.936 --> 04:08:42.141 region:rollup2
SO WE WE DO OF WORK RESPECTFULLY

04:08:40.406 --> 04:08:43.609 region:rollup2
REQUEST THAT THE SUBCOMMITTEE

04:08:42.141 --> 04:08:45.677 region:rollup2
ADOPT THAT.

04:08:43.609 --> 04:08:47.246 region:rollup2
AND THEN SECONDLY ON PAID SICK

04:08:45.677 --> 04:08:50.249 region:rollup2
LEAVE WHICH IS A VERY GOOD THING

04:08:47.246 --> 04:08:50.749 region:rollup2
IN WE FAR VERY LONG TO GET PAID

04:08:50.249 --> 04:08:51.817 region:rollup2
SICK LEAVE FOR I JUST AS

04:08:50.749 --> 04:08:54.920 region:rollup2
WORKERS.

04:08:51.817 --> 04:08:56.455 region:rollup2
WE'RE VERY CONCERNED THAT THE A

04:08:54.920 --> 04:08:58.223 region:rollup2
COMPREHENSIVE BACK UP PROVIDER

04:08:56.455 --> 04:09:00.359 region:rollup2
SYSTEM.

04:08:58.223 --> 04:09:02.127 region:rollup2
IS NOT GOING TO BE PUT INTO

04:09:00.359 --> 04:09:03.695 region:rollup2
PLACE IN EVERY COUNTY AND THE

04:09:02.127 --> 04:09:05.297 region:rollup2
REASON I SAY THIS ISN'T

04:09:03.695 --> 04:09:07.466 region:rollup2
NECESSARILY THAT THERE'S NOT.

04:09:05.297 --> 04:09:08.801 region:rollup2
DESIRE FOR ONE TO GO INTO PLACE

04:09:07.466 --> 04:09:11.670 region:rollup2
BY THE DEPARTMENT BUT WHAT

04:09:08.801 --> 04:09:13.806 region:rollup2
APPEARS TO BE A LACK OF FUNDING.

04:09:11.670 --> 04:09:15.107 region:rollup2
AND IF YOU SPEAK TO PEOPLE FROM

04:09:13.806 --> 04:09:17.242 region:rollup2
THE COUNTIES AND MEAN THIS IS A

04:09:15.107 --> 04:09:19.645 region:rollup2
JOINED EYES TO DATE COUNTY ADMIN

04:09:17.242 --> 04:09:20.646 region:rollup2
COSTS AND CONCERNS ABOUT PUBLIC

04:09:19.645 --> 04:09:22.648 region:rollup2
AUTHORITY FUNDING.

04:09:20.646 --> 04:09:23.682 region:rollup2
THERE IS SIMPLY NO WAY TO EXPECT

04:09:22.648 --> 04:09:25.751 region:rollup2
THAT COUNTIES ARE GOING TO

04:09:23.682 --> 04:09:27.386 region:rollup2
CREATE PROVIDER BACK UP SYSTEMS

04:09:25.751 --> 04:09:28.854 region:rollup2
THAT DON'T CURRENTLY EXIST

04:09:27.386 --> 04:09:32.324 region:rollup2
WITHOUT MONEY.

04:09:28.854 --> 04:09:35.194 region:rollup2
DO IT AND YOU KNOW HAVING INTENT

04:09:32.324 --> 04:09:37.129 region:rollup2
AND GOOD INTENTION IS GOOD BUT.

04:09:35.194 --> 04:09:39.264 region:rollup2
WITHOUT THE DOLLARS ALLOCATED

04:09:37.129 --> 04:09:40.999 region:rollup2
THAT IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN AND

04:09:39.264 --> 04:09:42.768 region:rollup2
WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT IF A

04:09:40.999 --> 04:09:44.102 region:rollup2
PROVIDER CALLS OUT SICK ANY

04:09:42.768 --> 04:09:46.271 region:rollup2
CONSUMER DOESN'T HAVE ANOTHER

04:09:44.102 --> 04:09:48.674 region:rollup2
PROVIDER TO CALL. WHICH MAY

04:09:46.271 --> 04:09:50.542 region:rollup2
OFTEN HAPPEN. THEN THAT PROVIDER

04:09:48.674 --> 04:09:52.010 region:rollup2
PROBABLY WILL FEEL LIKE THEY

04:09:50.542 --> 04:09:53.545 region:rollup2
SHOULDN'T CALL OUT SICK AND WILL

04:09:52.010 --> 04:09:54.112 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO WORK IS THAT

04:09:53.545 --> 04:09:56.081 region:rollup2
CONSUMER WON'T HAVE ANOTHER

04:09:54.112 --> 04:09:57.850 region:rollup2
PROVIDER WHERE THE CONSUMER WILL

04:09:56.081 --> 04:10:01.420 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY HAVE NO PROVIDER AND.

04:09:57.850 --> 04:10:03.522 region:rollup2
BE IN A VERY BAD SITUATION SO.

04:10:01.420 --> 04:10:04.890 region:rollup2
A REAL PROVIDER BACKUP SYSTEM IS

04:10:03.522 --> 04:10:06.492 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT WE TALKED ABOUT

04:10:04.890 --> 04:10:08.494 region:rollup2
ORIGINALLY WHEN S. B. THREE

04:10:06.492 --> 04:10:10.996 region:rollup2
FIRST PASSED.

04:10:08.494 --> 04:10:12.831 region:rollup2
TWO YEARS AGO AND. IT FELL OFF

04:10:10.996 --> 04:10:14.399 region:rollup2
ON THE PAGE

04:10:12.831 --> 04:10:15.901 region:rollup2
ALL OF LAST YEAR IN AND IT

04:10:14.399 --> 04:10:20.005 region:rollup2
APPEARS THAT THERE'S JUST.

04:10:15.901 --> 04:10:21.640 region:rollup2
RELUCTANCE TO FUND IT THIS BUT

04:10:20.005 --> 04:10:23.075 region:rollup2
AGAIN WE WE THIS IS IT.

04:10:21.640 --> 04:10:24.643 region:rollup2
THIS IS A BENEFIT BUT IT'S ONLY

04:10:23.075 --> 04:10:26.278 region:rollup2
A BENEFIT THAT WILL BE TAKEN IF

04:10:24.643 --> 04:10:27.813 region:rollup2
THERE'S SOMETHING EMPLOYEES FOR

04:10:26.278 --> 04:10:30.148 region:rollup2
WHEN THAT WORKERS NOT ABLE TO

04:10:27.813 --> 04:10:31.950 region:rollup2
WORK SO WE WE WE REQUEST FUNDING

SEVEN PERCENT ARE AGES AS

04:10:41.293 --> 04:10:43.996 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS SHOULD NOT HAVE TO

CONTINUOUSLY COME TO THE STATE

04:10:43.996 --> 04:10:46.064 region:rollup2

04:35:55.506 --> 04:35:58.942 region:rollup2
IS AN APPROPRIATE.

04:35:57.241 --> 04:36:00.244 region:rollup2
ARMED THE RESULT IS THAT THERE

04:35:58.942 --> 04:36:01.412 region:rollup2
ARE AT LEAST FIFTEEN CHANGE

04:36:00.244 --> 04:36:03.313 region:rollup2
REQUEST THERE SITTING IN THE

04:36:01.412 --> 04:36:04.248 region:rollup2
QUEUE.

04:36:03.313 --> 04:36:06.116 region:rollup2
I'M MORE THAT ARE BIG.

04:36:04.248 --> 04:36:07.251 region:rollup2
WAITING TO BE ADDED TO THE

04:36:06.116 --> 04:36:08.952 region:rollup2
QUEUE THAT'S A DECISION THAT THE

04:36:07.251 --> 04:36:10.554 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT GETS TO MAKE AND SOME

04:36:08.952 --> 04:36:11.922 region:rollup2
OF THESE CHANGER QUESTS.

04:36:10.554 --> 04:36:14.124 region:rollup2
ARE AS OLD AS THE SEEM AT TO

04:36:11.922 --> 04:36:16.593 region:rollup2
SYSTEM ITSELF GOING BACK TO TWO

04:36:14.124 --> 04:36:18.429 region:rollup2
THOUSAND FOURTEEN.

04:36:16.593 --> 04:36:19.296 region:rollup2
THAT THIS MAY SOUND TECHIE.

04:36:18.429 --> 04:36:21.865 region:rollup2
IT'S SORT OF.

04:36:19.296 --> 04:36:23.600 region:rollup2
ARM.

04:36:21.865 --> 04:36:25.169 region:rollup2
THIS IS THAT COMPUTER TECHNICAL

04:36:23.600 --> 04:36:26.336 region:rollup2
ISSUE IT CAN'T REALLY MATTER BUT

04:36:25.169 --> 04:36:28.505 region:rollup2
IT ACTUALLY REALLY DOES MATTER

04:36:26.336 --> 04:36:30.607 region:rollup2
LET ME GIVE YOU A FEW EXAMPLES.

04:36:28.505 --> 04:36:31.875 region:rollup2
ONE CHANGE WOULD INCREASE THE

04:36:30.607 --> 04:36:34.445 region:rollup2
AMOUNT OF SPACE A SOCIAL WORKER

04:36:31.875 --> 04:36:35.012 region:rollup2
HAS SO THEY CAN FULLY DOCUMENT

04:36:34.445 --> 04:36:37.247 region:rollup2
THEIR ASSESSMENT OF HOW THE

04:36:35.012 --> 04:36:39.183 region:rollup2
CONSUMERS ARE DOING.

04:36:37.247 --> 04:36:40.951 region:rollup2
ANOTHER CHANGE WOULD ADD SPACE

04:36:39.183 --> 04:36:42.519 region:rollup2
SO THAT WE COULD HAVE ADDITIONAL

04:36:40.951 --> 04:36:44.221 region:rollup2
EMAILS.

04:36:42.519 --> 04:36:45.722 region:rollup2
I AM AN ADDITIONAL PHONE LINES

04:36:44.221 --> 04:36:47.357 region:rollup2
FOR PROVIDERS SO THAT IN A

04:36:45.722 --> 04:36:48.926 region:rollup2
DISASTER RESPONSE.

04:36:47.357 --> 04:36:49.993 region:rollup2
WERE BETTER ABLE TO GET IN

04:36:48.926 --> 04:36:52.863 region:rollup2
TOUCH WITH PROVIDERS.

04:36:49.993 --> 04:36:55.265 region:rollup2
.

04:36:52.863 --> 04:36:56.533 region:rollup2
IN ADDITION AT ONE EXAMPLE IS

04:36:55.265 --> 04:36:58.402 region:rollup2
BEING ABLE TO ADD INFORMATION

04:36:56.533 --> 04:37:00.471 region:rollup2
ABOUT AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE

04:36:58.402 --> 04:37:02.106 region:rollup2
SOME CLIENTS HAVE PEOPLE THAT

04:37:00.471 --> 04:37:03.140 region:rollup2
CAN ACT ON THEIR BEHALF.

04:37:02.106 --> 04:37:04.374 region:rollup2
SO THAT WE HAVE THAT INFORMATION

04:37:03.140 --> 04:37:05.375 region:rollup2
IN THE SYSTEMIC CAN IMPROVE

04:37:04.374 --> 04:37:07.244 region:rollup2
CUSTOMER SERVICE.

04:37:05.375 --> 04:37:09.346 region:rollup2
.

04:37:07.244 --> 04:37:11.582 region:rollup2
THE INABILITY TO HAVE SORT OF A

04:37:09.346 --> 04:37:12.649 region:rollup2
REASONABLE DEGREE OF

04:37:11.582 --> 04:37:14.952 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTATION OF.

04:37:12.649 --> 04:37:17.688 region:rollup2
COUNTY DRIVEN CHANGE REQUESTS

04:37:14.952 --> 04:37:19.323 region:rollup2
RESULTS AND MANUAL WORKAROUNDS

04:37:17.688 --> 04:37:21.091 region:rollup2
INEFFICIENT TIME AND

04:37:19.323 --> 04:37:23.327 region:rollup2
INCONSISTENT SERVICE FOR.

04:37:21.091 --> 04:37:25.195 region:rollup2
TAPPER CLIENTS AND SO WE'RE

04:37:23.327 --> 04:37:26.697 region:rollup2
REQUESTING THREE THINGS.

04:37:25.195 --> 04:37:27.831 region:rollup2
THE FIRST IS AN ADDITIONAL ONE

04:37:26.697 --> 04:37:30.133 region:rollup2
TIME PART OF.

04:37:27.831 --> 04:37:32.536 region:rollup2
FUNDS TWO POINT FIVE MILLION A

04:37:30.133 --> 04:37:34.004 region:rollup2
GENERAL FUND WHICH WHEN MATCHED

04:37:32.536 --> 04:37:35.706 region:rollup2
UP WITH FEDERAL FUNDS.

04:37:34.004 --> 04:37:36.974 region:rollup2
AND WE BELIEVE WOULD BE ABLE TO

04:37:35.706 --> 04:37:38.442 region:rollup2
WORK THROUGH THE EXISTING

04:37:36.974 --> 04:37:39.910 region:rollup2
BACKLOG.

04:37:38.442 --> 04:37:42.079 region:rollup2
TO MAKE SURE THEIR BACKLOG

04:37:39.910 --> 04:37:44.114 region:rollup2
DOESN'T MATERIALIZE AGAIN WERE

04:37:42.079 --> 04:37:46.416 region:rollup2
REQUESTING THAT FIVE PERCENT OF

04:37:44.114 --> 04:37:47.751 region:rollup2
THAT THIRTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS

04:37:46.416 --> 04:37:50.053 region:rollup2
BE DEDICATED FOR COUNTY

04:37:47.751 --> 04:37:52.256 region:rollup2
GENERATED CHANGE REQUESTS.

04:37:50.053 --> 04:37:54.224 region:rollup2
NUMBER ALSO ASKING FOR A POLICY

04:37:52.256 --> 04:37:56.160 region:rollup2
WHEREBY WHEN SIGNIFICANT NEW

04:37:54.224 --> 04:37:58.328 region:rollup2
POLICY CHANGES ARE MADE TO THE

04:37:56.160 --> 04:37:59.863 region:rollup2
STATE. THAT WE APPROPRIATE THE

04:37:58.328 --> 04:38:02.199 region:rollup2
NECESSARY FUNDS TO AUTOMATE

04:37:59.863 --> 04:38:03.500 region:rollup2
THOSE CHANGES AND NOT USE A POT

04:38:02.199 --> 04:38:05.636 region:rollup2
OF MONEY.

04:38:03.500 --> 04:38:06.837 region:rollup2
THAT WAS NEVER INTENDED TO FUND

04:38:05.636 --> 04:38:09.206 region:rollup2
THOSE DOES SIGNIFICANT NEW

04:38:06.837 --> 04:38:10.340 region:rollup2
POLICY CHANGES.

04:38:09.206 --> 04:38:13.844 region:rollup2
AND WE APPRECIATE YOUR

04:38:10.340 --> 04:38:16.146 region:rollup2
CONSIDERATION OF THIS REQUEST.

04:38:13.844 --> 04:38:17.881 region:rollup2
DIRECTOR LIKE ONE. OFF. ALWAYS

04:38:16.146 --> 04:38:19.316 region:rollup2
STRUGGLED TO TRY TO GET ON THE

04:38:17.881 --> 04:38:21.285 region:rollup2
SAME PAGE WITH MY FRIEND MISTER

04:38:19.316 --> 04:38:23.186 region:rollup2
AMERICA. HOME IN THIS INSTANCE

04:38:21.285 --> 04:38:24.855 region:rollup2
AYE AYE WHAT I'D SUGGEST IS THAT

04:38:23.186 --> 04:38:27.624 region:rollup2
WE GO ON HAVING DIALOGUE WITH

04:38:24.855 --> 04:38:29.293 region:rollup2
THE ASSOCIATION ON WHAT WE MAY

04:38:27.624 --> 04:38:30.327 region:rollup2
PERHAPS A SOLUTION.

04:38:29.293 --> 04:38:31.361 region:rollup2
AND WITH THAT FLOWS COMPLICATED

04:38:30.327 --> 04:38:33.864 region:rollup2
WILL SIMPLY BE TO HAPPY

04:38:31.361 --> 04:38:35.832 region:rollup2
ASSOCIATION REPRESENTED ON THE.

04:38:33.864 --> 04:38:38.535 region:rollup2
CHANGE CONTROL MANAGEMENT

04:38:35.832 --> 04:38:40.037 region:rollup2
PROCESS FOR SEE MAPS MUCHAS WE

04:38:38.535 --> 04:38:42.206 region:rollup2
ARE WORKING WITH THEM TO HAVE TO

04:38:40.037 --> 04:38:45.209 region:rollup2
STATE REPRESENTED ON THE SOLES.

04:38:42.206 --> 04:38:47.211 region:rollup2
CHANGE MANAGEMENT BOARD.

04:38:45.209 --> 04:38:49.513 region:rollup2
ELIOT IF I MIGHT IS NOT A BAD

04:38:47.211 --> 04:38:50.714 region:rollup2
IDEA. ARM BUT IF THE COUNTIES

04:38:49.513 --> 04:38:52.416 region:rollup2
ARE REPRESENTED ON A CHAIR ON

04:38:50.714 --> 04:38:54.017 region:rollup2
THE GOVERNMENT SYSTEM. THAT

04:38:52.416 --> 04:38:55.686 region:rollup2
DOESN'T CHANGE THE FACT THAT THE

04:38:54.017 --> 04:38:57.521 region:rollup2
NEXT SIGNIFICANT POLICY THAT

04:38:55.686 --> 04:38:58.088 region:rollup2
HAPPENS THE DEPARTMENT OF

04:38:57.521 --> 04:38:59.289 region:rollup2
FINANCE DECIDES NOT TO FUND

04:38:58.088 --> 04:39:01.291 region:rollup2
THAT.

04:38:59.289 --> 04:39:02.793 region:rollup2
DE AUTOMATION NECESSARY AND

04:39:01.291 --> 04:39:04.261 region:rollup2
THEN THAT AND THEN WE USE AN

04:39:02.793 --> 04:39:06.430 region:rollup2
EXISTING POT OF FUNDS THAT WAS

04:39:04.261 --> 04:39:08.398 region:rollup2
NEVER INTENDED FOR EXAMPLE.

04:39:06.430 --> 04:39:10.133 region:rollup2
SO WHILE I APPRECIATE THE

04:39:08.398 --> 04:39:11.668 region:rollup2
SINCERITY AND I THINK IT'S AN

04:39:10.133 --> 04:39:13.637 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT PART OF THE SOLUTION.

04:39:11.668 --> 04:39:14.805 region:rollup2
TO DISCUSS GOVERNANCE I DON'T

04:39:13.637 --> 04:39:16.707 region:rollup2
BELIEVE IT'S A FISH AND.

04:39:14.805 --> 04:39:18.108 region:rollup2
TO DEAL WITH THE UNDERLYING

04:39:16.707 --> 04:39:21.778 region:rollup2
PROBLEM OF THE BACKLOG.

04:39:18.108 --> 04:39:23.013 region:rollup2
A LOON DEPARTMENT OF.

04:39:21.778 --> 04:39:24.414 region:rollup2
YEAH YOU IF I IT'S I I DO WANT

04:39:23.013 --> 04:39:24.848 region:rollup2
TO NOTE THAT WHEN IT COMES TO

04:39:24.414 --> 04:39:26.583 region:rollup2
MAJOR POLICY CHANGES

04:39:24.848 --> 04:39:28.652 region:rollup2
I DO PROVIDES.

04:39:26.583 --> 04:39:30.587 region:rollup2
FUNDING FOR THOSE AUTOMATION.

04:39:28.652 --> 04:39:31.288 region:rollup2
FOR EXAMPLE WE.

04:39:30.587 --> 04:39:33.724 region:rollup2
DID THE.

04:39:31.288 --> 04:39:35.125 region:rollup2
LATEST CHANGES WITH OVERTIME WE

04:39:33.724 --> 04:39:36.860 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE THAT THERE WAS SIR

04:39:35.125 --> 04:39:38.428 region:rollup2
MONEY FOR CEMEX TO ACCOMMODATE

04:39:36.860 --> 04:39:39.930 region:rollup2
THOSE CHANGES.

04:39:38.428 --> 04:39:40.764 region:rollup2
SO I JUST MORE POINT OUT THAT

04:39:39.930 --> 04:39:42.633 region:rollup2
WE.

04:39:40.764 --> 04:39:44.268 region:rollup2

04:39:42.633 --> 04:39:46.670 region:rollup2
SUCH RESOURCES WE AND WE CAN

04:39:44.268 --> 04:39:49.006 region:rollup2
THAT WE CAN DOCUMENT FOR YOU HOW

04:39:46.670 --> 04:39:50.841 region:rollup2
THE QUEUE OF CHANGES THAT WERE

04:39:49.006 --> 04:39:53.543 region:rollup2
IN THE HOPPER. GOT PUSHED OFTEN

04:39:50.841 --> 04:39:55.145 region:rollup2
DELAYED WHEN THINGS USURPED

04:39:53.543 --> 04:39:56.413 region:rollup2
THINGS BECAME A HIGHER PRIORITY

04:39:55.145 --> 04:39:58.382 region:rollup2
THAT WERE THE FUNCTION OF POLICY

04:39:56.413 --> 04:40:00.884 region:rollup2
CHANGES THAT THE STATE.

04:39:58.382 --> 04:40:01.485 region:rollup2
BUT AGAIN I ALWAYS TRY TO STAY

IN TRUTH THERE'S A THROUGHPUT

04:40:02.919 --> 04:40:07.057 region:rollup2
ISSUE

04:40:04.254 --> 04:40:08.925 region:rollup2
WHICH IS THERE'S ONLY SO MUCH

04:40:07.057 --> 04:40:10.927 region:rollup2
BANDWIDTH THAN WHEN THE.

04:40:08.925 --> 04:40:12.863 region:rollup2
FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS AROUND FAIR

LABOR STANDARDS ACT OCCURRED IT

04:40:12.863 --> 04:40:16.099 region:rollup2

EVERYTHING ELSE THAT TO GIVE WAY

04:40:16.099 --> 04:40:20.804 region:rollup2
FOR ITS IMPLEMENTATION.

04:40:17.701 --> 04:40:22.105 region:rollup2
IN OTHER POLICY CHANGES FRANKLY.

04:40:20.804 --> 04:40:24.307 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATURE DETERMINES

04:40:22.105 --> 04:40:25.709 region:rollup2
SO IF.

04:40:24.307 --> 04:40:26.910 region:rollup2

HOMELESSNESS IN THIS POPULATION.

04:57:03.406 --> 04:57:06.308 region:rollup2
IN OUR RESEARCH WE FOUND THAT

04:57:04.974 --> 04:57:08.577 region:rollup2
AMONG SINGLE ADULTS WHO ARE

04:57:06.308 --> 04:57:10.279 region:rollup2

FIFTY.

04:57:20.156 --> 04:57:23.359 region:rollup2
MANY OF THESE WERE PEOPLE WHO

04:57:22.124 --> 04:57:25.061 region:rollup2
HAD BEEN LEFT VULNERABLE BY

04:57:23.359 --> 04:57:26.495 region:rollup2
ELLIS JOB LOSS LOSS OF A FAMILY

04:57:25.061 --> 04:57:28.664 region:rollup2
MEMBER.

04:57:26.495 --> 04:57:30.599 region:rollup2
OR OTHER ABUSE AND IT WAS THAT

04:57:28.664 --> 04:57:32.568 region:rollup2
ABUSE PHYSICAL ABUSE FINANCIAL

04:57:30.599 --> 04:57:34.370 region:rollup2
EXPLOITATION THAT LED DIRECTLY

04:57:32.568 --> 04:57:36.072 region:rollup2

EXPERIENCE IT IT'S A PERSONAL

04:57:41.143 --> 04:57:44.380 region:rollup2
CATASTROPHE A CATASTROPHE WITH

04:57:43.012 --> 04:57:46.182 region:rollup2
DEVASTATING CONSEQUENCES FOR

04:57:44.380 --> 04:57:48.117 region:rollup2
HEALTH AND SAFETY.

04:57:46.182 --> 04:57:49.185 region:rollup2
TO END HOMELESSNESS WE NEED TO

04:57:48.117 --> 04:57:50.686 region:rollup2
SHUT THE FRONT DOOR TO

04:57:49.185 --> 04:57:52.388 region:rollup2
HOMELESSNESS

04:57:50.686 --> 04:57:54.256 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO PREVENT HOMELESSNESS

04:57:52.388 --> 04:57:55.891 region:rollup2
BEFORE IT OCCURS IN THE FIRST

04:57:54.256 --> 04:57:58.661 region:rollup2
PLACE. PREVENTING HOMELESSNESS

04:57:55.891 --> 04:58:00.296 region:rollup2

04:57:58.661 --> 04:58:01.897 region:rollup2
RE HOUSING PEOPLE WHO HAVE

04:58:00.296 --> 04:58:03.365 region:rollup2

PROACTIVELY TO PEOPLE WHO ARE AT

04:58:07.169 --> 04:58:10.306 region:rollup2
HIGH RISK OF LOSING HOUSING. BUT

04:58:09.205 --> 04:58:12.174 region:rollup2
WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO

04:58:10.306 --> 04:58:13.509 region:rollup2
RECTIFY THIS WITH HOME SAFE

04:58:12.174 --> 04:58:16.112 region:rollup2
ADULT PROTECTIVE SERVICES

04:58:13.509 --> 04:58:16.979 region:rollup2
WORKERS ARE THE ONES WHO

04:58:16.112 --> 04:58:19.348 region:rollup2
INTERACT WITH GLOBAL ALLDERS AT

04:58:16.979 --> 04:58:20.583 region:rollup2
THIS PIVOTAL MOMENT OF CRISIS.

04:58:19.348 --> 04:58:22.485 region:rollup2

HAVE ACTED UPON PREVENT THAT

04:58:22.485 --> 04:58:25.454 region:rollup2
RARE OPPORTUNITY TO ACTUALLY

PREVENT HOMELESSNESS BEFORE IT

04:58:25.454 --> 04:58:28.791 region:rollup2
OCCURS.

04:58:27.089 --> 04:58:30.626 region:rollup2
WHATEVER STUDY PARTICIPANTS ARE

04:58:28.791 --> 04:58:31.761 region:rollup2

THERE HE MET SOMEONE WHO OFFERED

04:58:46.108 --> 04:58:51.013 region:rollup2

04:58:47.877 --> 04:58:51.614 region:rollup2
HIS PAY E.. THIS PAY E. TOLD HIM

04:58:51.013 --> 04:58:53.883 region:rollup2
THAT HE COULD HELP MANAGE ITS

04:58:51.614 --> 04:58:55.351 region:rollup2
BUDGET IF HE HANDED OVER HIS

04:58:53.883 --> 04:58:57.153 region:rollup2

04:59:04.827 --> 04:59:07.997 region:rollup2
THE TRIP REQUIRE TEE TO TAKE

04:59:06.162 --> 04:59:09.665 region:rollup2

04:59:13.836 --> 04:59:17.540 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THIS HE FELL BEHIND

04:59:15.771 --> 04:59:19.475 region:rollup2
AND WAS EVICTED WITH NO FAMILY

04:59:17.540 --> 04:59:21.444 region:rollup2

04:59:19.475 --> 04:59:22.178 region:rollup2
HOMELESS AND AND RESORTED TO

04:59:45.501 --> 04:59:48.637 region:rollup2
POPULATION SO THEY MAY BE IN

04:59:47.303 --> 04:59:49.705 region:rollup2
THEIR FIFTIES THEY REALLY WERE

04:59:48.637 --> 04:59:51.040 region:rollup2
MORE LIKE PEOPLE IN THEIR

04:59:49.705 --> 04:59:52.141 region:rollup2
SEVENTIES OR EIGHTIES IN TERMS

04:59:51.040 --> 04:59:54.076 region:rollup2
OF THEIR HOUSE.

04:59:52.141 --> 04:59:55.344 region:rollup2
HOMELESSNESS AGES PEOPLE IRAQ

04:59:54.076 --> 04:59:56.779 region:rollup2
WHICH IS THEIR BODIES THEIR

04:59:55.344 --> 04:59:58.080 region:rollup2
MINDS IN THEIR SPIRITS.

04:59:56.779 --> 04:59:59.348 region:rollup2
AND WHEN OLDER ADULTS BECOME

04:59:58.080 --> 05:00:00.749 region:rollup2
HOMELESS THE CAN NO LONGER

04:59:59.348 --> 05:00:01.784 region:rollup2
ACCESS THEIR PRIMARY CARE

05:00:00.749 --> 05:00:03.819 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS AND THEIR MENTAL

05:00:01.784 --> 05:00:05.321 region:rollup2
HEALTH PROVIDERS AND RELY

05:00:03.819 --> 05:00:08.357 region:rollup2
INSTEAD ON EMERGENCY CARE.

05:00:05.321 --> 05:00:10.426 region:rollup2
pOF THE OLDER ADULTS WE STUDIED

05:00:08.357 --> 05:00:11.427 region:rollup2
HAD VISITED EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT

05:00:10.426 --> 05:00:12.661 region:rollup2
AND ELEVEN PERCENT HAD BEEN

05:00:11.427 --> 05:00:14.530 region:rollup2
HOSPITALIZED FOR PHYSICAL HEALTH

05:00:12.661 --> 05:00:16.432 region:rollup2
PROBLEMS.

05:00:14.530 --> 05:00:17.933 region:rollup2
HOMELESSNESS IS CATASTROPHIC.

05:00:16.432 --> 05:00:19.835 region:rollup2
TO HEALTH AND WELL BEING AND IT

05:00:17.933 --> 05:00:21.637 region:rollup2
ALSO PREPARED TO TENCHI IT'S THE

05:00:19.835 --> 05:00:23.005 region:rollup2
RISK OF VICTIMIZATION. AND OUR

05:00:21.637 --> 05:00:24.306 region:rollup2
RESEARCH WE FOUND THAT PEOPLE

05:00:23.005 --> 05:00:25.374 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE HOMELESSNESS SORT

05:00:24.306 --> 05:00:26.675 region:rollup2
ENORMOUS RISK OF BEING

05:00:25.374 --> 05:00:28.577 region:rollup2
VICTIMIZED WHILE THERE ARE

05:00:26.675 --> 05:00:30.846 region:rollup2
HOMELESS BOTH PHYSICAL AND

05:00:28.577 --> 05:00:33.582 region:rollup2
SEXUAL VIOLENCE EXTRAORDINARILY

05:00:30.846 --> 05:00:35.684 region:rollup2
COMMON. WE FOUND THAT THIS RISK

05:00:33.582 --> 05:00:37.119 region:rollup2
IS CUT BY HALF IS SOON AS THEY

05:00:35.684 --> 05:00:39.154 region:rollup2
BECOME REHOUSED.

05:00:37.119 --> 05:00:40.956 region:rollup2
THEREFORE HOME SAFE WOULD ALLOW

05:00:39.154 --> 05:00:42.224 region:rollup2
APS WORKERS NOT ONLY TO PREVENT

05:00:40.956 --> 05:00:43.325 region:rollup2
HOMELESSNESS BUT TO PREVENT

05:00:42.224 --> 05:00:45.227 region:rollup2
FURTHER VICTIMIZATION AT A

05:00:43.325 --> 05:00:46.996 region:rollup2
CRITICAL POINT.

05:00:45.227 --> 05:00:49.164 region:rollup2
AS A PHYSICIAN I CAN SAY THAT

05:00:46.996 --> 05:00:51.300 region:rollup2
THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT STEP I

05:00:49.164 --> 05:00:53.068 region:rollup2
CAN TAKE FOR PATIENTS IS TO HELP

05:00:51.300 --> 05:00:54.970 region:rollup2
THEM RETAIN THEIR HOUSING. THERE

05:00:53.068 --> 05:00:56.572 region:rollup2
IS NO MEDICINE AS POWERFUL AS

05:00:54.970 --> 05:00:57.873 region:rollup2
HOUSING.

05:00:56.572 --> 05:00:59.742 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE MEMBERS I URGE YOU TO

05:00:57.873 --> 05:01:01.377 region:rollup2

HOMELESSNESS AND OLDER ADULTS ON

05:01:01.377 --> 05:01:05.180 region:rollup2

SOCIETY HOUSING IS THE BEST

05:01:05.180 --> 05:01:08.951 region:rollup2
MEDICINE AND HOME SAFE IS A

05:01:06.916 --> 05:01:10.286 region:rollup2
COMMON WAY TO COMMONSENSE WAY TO

05:01:08.951 --> 05:01:11.287 region:rollup2

GRANT PROGRAM

05:01:56.131 --> 05:01:58.834 region:rollup2
COUNTIES WOULD HAVE TO MATCH IT

05:01:57.366 --> 05:02:01.870 region:rollup2
DOLLAR FOR DOLLAR.

05:01:58.834 --> 05:02:03.606 region:rollup2

HOME PROGRAM.

05:02:12.214 --> 05:02:16.485 region:rollup2
THOSE ARE TWO INVESTMENTS WISE

05:02:14.450 --> 05:02:17.052 region:rollup2
INVESTMENTS THAT THE LEGISLATURE

05:02:16.485 --> 05:02:18.187 region:rollup2

THE SUCCESSFUL MODELS.

05:02:30.766 --> 05:02:34.370 region:rollup2
THE MODEL REQUIRES SO A COUNTY

05:02:32.501 --> 05:02:36.005 region:rollup2
MATCH DOLLAR FOR DOLLAR SO THE

05:02:34.370 --> 05:02:37.806 region:rollup2
COUNTY WILL HAVE AN INVESTMENT.

05:02:36.005 --> 05:02:40.442 region:rollup2
YOUR SKIN IN THE GAME THE COUNTY

ONE OF THE FACTORS THAT WE'VE

05:05:01.183 --> 05:05:04.253 region:rollup2
LOOKED AT A LOT IS THE

05:05:02.184 --> 05:05:04.686 region:rollup2
INCREASING INCIDENCE OF
