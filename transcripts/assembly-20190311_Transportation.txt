THE PODIUM AND START WHEN YOU'RE READY SIR THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF MY WITNESSES ARE PRESENT -- THIS BILL CONCERNS DISTRACTED DRIVING WHICH AS MOST OF US UNDERSTAND CAN BE AS DEADLY AS IMPAIRED DRIVING -- FOR WE'VE INTRODUCED THIS BILL TO IMPROVE SAFETY ON OUR ROADS THE BILL WILL STRENGTHEN THE PENALTY FOR DISTRACTED DRIVING TO INCLUDE A POINT VIOLATION ON A PERSON'S DRIVING RECORD RESEARCH SUGGESTS THE DRIVERS WHO TEXT MESSAGE WHILE DRIVING ARE EIGHT TIMES AS LIKELY TO BE IN AN ACCIDENT OR A NEAR ACCIDENT AS DRIVERS WHO ARE NOT TEXTING UNFORTUNATELY OUR EXISTING DISTRACTED DRIVING LAWS HAVE NOT DONE ENOUGH TO DETER THIS DANGEROUS PRACTICE FOR EXAMPLE THE DMV REPORTS THAT IN THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND AND SIXTEEN THERE WERE NEARLY TWO HUNDRED NINE THOUSAND SUCH OFFENSES TICKETS GIVEN OUT THE NUMBER JUMPED TO TWENTY PERCENT THE FOLLOWING YEAR THOSE THE MOST RECENT STATS SO AFTER THAT TWENTY PERCENT JUMP THERE WERE TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY FOUR THOUSAND TICKETS HANDED OUT IN THE YEAR TWENTY SEVENTEEN CLEARLY THE CURRENT PENALTIES -- WHICH ARE QUITE SMALL A BASE FINE OF TWENTY DOLLARS FOR FIRST VIOLATION AND FIFTY DOLLARS FOR SUBSEQUENT VIOLATIONS HAVE HAD LITTLE IMPACT ON THIS DANGEROUS PRACTICE BY ELEVATING DISTRACTED DRIVING CITATIONS TO THE SAME STATUS AS OTHER DANGEROUS DRIVING VIOLATIONS SUCH AS SPEEDING OR RUNNING A RED LIGHT THE MEASURE WILL HELP MAKE ROADS SAFER FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS WITH ME TODAY OUR MIKE KNUDSEN ON BEHALF OF THE AUTOMOBILE CLUB OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND JONATHON FELDMAN ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA POLICE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION MISTER KNUDSEN DO YOU WANT TO PROCEED MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF MY NEEDS IN HERE ON BEHALF OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WE ARE -- ARGUABLY THE LARGEST TRAFFIC SAFETY ORGANIZATION IN THE STATE -- WE ARE THE SPONSORS OF THE MEASURE -- THIS IS BASED ON OUR RESEARCH IS ONE OF THE SINGLE MOST DANGEROUS THINGS THAT HAPPENS ON OUR HIGHWAYS WE THINK SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE ABOUT DONE ABOUT IT -- IT IS A SERIOUS AND GROWING PROBLEM IF YOU DRIVE AT ALL AND YOU LOOK TO THE LEFT OR LOOK TO THE RIGHT YOU WILL SEE SOMEBODY ON THEIR PHONE UNLESS OF COURSE YOU'RE ON YOURS THEN YOU MAY NOT SEE IT BUT -- IT'S A IT'S A HUGE PROBLEM -- IT'S GETTING WORSE IT'S UNDER REPORTED NEED TO WE NEED TO CHANGE THE NARRATIVE WE NEED TO -- CHANGE THE CULTURE JUST LIKE WE DID WITH DO YOU EYES AND CONTINUE TO TRY TO DO JUST LIKE WE DID WITH SEAT BELTS WE NEED TO WE NEED TO START SENDING THE A PROPER MESSAGE THIS IS AN OUTLIER IN TERMS OF -- UNSAFE DRIVING ACTIVITY THAT DOESN'T GET A POINT AND WE'RE JUST TRYING TO HARMONIZE THE LAW -- DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS VERY DANGEROUS THING -- WE BELIEVE THAT IT WILL SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE ACCIDENTS INJURIES AND DEATHS AND RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS PLEASE STATEMENT WE REPRESENT CHAIR MEMBERS JONATHON FELDMAN WITH THE CALIFORNIA POLICE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION -- PLEASE USE ONE OF THE PRIMARY GROUP THAT SUPPORTED AB SEVENTEEN EIGHTY FIVE FROM TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN THAT FIXED LOOPHOLES IN OUR CURRENT DISTRACTED DRIVING LAWS THAT WERE ALLOWING PEOPLE ACTUALLY USE THEIR PHONES WHILE DRIVING AND ALTHOUGH WE FIX THAT LOOPHOLE AND IT'S OUR LAWS CLEAR NOW YOU CAN'T HOLDEN OPERATE YOUR PHONE WHILE DRIVING -- IT'S STILL AN EFFECTIVE IN DETERRING THIS DANGEROUS BEHAVIOR AND THAT'S A THAT'S A PROBLEM THIS BILL IS TRYING TO ADDRESS AND IT IS A DANGEROUS BEHAVIOR I MEAN I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE YOU KNOW THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS PROBABLY NOTED THAT -- LOOKING AWAY FROM THE ROAD IT FOR FIVE SECONDS WHILE DRIVING AT FIFTY FIVE MILES AN HOUR THE SAME THING IS GOING BLIND FOLDED -- FOR THE LENGTH OF A FOOTBALL FIELD I DON'T THINK ANYONE OF US WOULD DO THAT NO BLIND FOR THEMSELVES WHILE DRIVING FIFTY FIVE MILES AN HOUR BUT TOO MANY OF US DO THAT -- SAME BEHAVIOR BY TEXTING AND LOOKING AT THE PHONE WHILE DRIVING THE LA TIMES LAST YEAR IN AN ARTICLE -- TITLED TEXTING WHILE DRIVING IS AS DANGEROUS AS DRUNK DRIVING AND WE NEED TO TREAT IT ACCORDINGLY -- FOUND THAT TEXTING IS THE MOST COMMON FORM OF DISTRACTED DRIVING AND TEAMS ARE PARTICULARLY AT RISK FOUR TIMES MORE LIKELY THAN OLDER DRIVERS TO BE DISTRACTED BY THEIR CELL PHONES WHILE DRIVING -- VIOLATIONS FOR DRIVING ARE VIOLATIONS FOR DR -- USING A CELLPHONE CARE THE LOWEST BASE FIND FOR ANY VIOLATION OF THE VEHICLE CODE WAS ALSO POINTED OUT YOUR NOW SAYS AND IF THIS IS AS SERIOUS AS A PROBLEM AS WE ALL BELIEVE IT IS AS THE LAW ENFORCEMENT PROFESSIONALS RESEARCHERS -- IN STUDIES APPOINTED TO BE YOU KNOW IT'S TIME THAT WE ACTUALLY DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT IN THIS BILL TAKES AN APPROPRIATE STEP TOWARDS REDUCING THE INJURIES AND FATALITIES FROM THIS BEHAVIOR SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE THANKS FOR THIS POSITION IN NEW REPRESENT PLEASE MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE JAMES OF ART OF BEHALF OF A PAID A CALIFORNIA MOTORCYCLE RIGHTS AND SAFETY ORGANIZATION AND IT'S VERY DANGEROUS FOR US HAVING NO PROTECTION RUNNER MOTORCYCLES WHEN CARS IF YOU'RE INTO OUR LANE BECAUSE

FIRST I'D LIKE TO YOU INTEREST AND AND YOUR INTEREST IN THIS BILL -- I THINK THAT I WOULD LIKE TO START BY SAYING THAT WE OBVIOUSLY RECOGNIZE IT'S A SERIOUS PROBLEM -- OUR DRIVERS YOU KNOW THEY SPEND AN INORDINATE AMOUNT OF TIME ON THE ROADS THEY SHARE THE ROADS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE TAKING PART IN THIS DANGEROUS BEHAVIOR OPPOSING LESS AMENDED POSITION WE LIKE TO SEE THE BILL -- TAKE A BIT OF A MORE INCREMENTAL APPROACH WITH THERE BEING A FINE FOR THE FIRST OFFENSE IN A POINT ON EACH SUBSEQUENT -- EVENT THERE AFTER -- ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO WE BOUGHT BROUGHT STATE LINE TO CONFORMITY WITH FEDERAL LAW AND -- A POINT ON YOUR PERSONAL LICENSE ALSO AFFECTS YOUR COMMERCIAL LICENSE OUR GUYS WHEN THEY'RE DRIVING IN THEIR COMMERCIAL VEHICLE WHERE IT'S OF INSTANT FIREBALL FENCE IT'S WHAT HAPPENS IN THE WEEKEND -- WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THEY'RE IN THEIR PERSONAL TIME -- AND AND I THINK THAT A LOT OF A LOT HAS BEEN MADE ABOUT TRAFFIC SAFETY SCHOOL AND HOW YOU CAN YOU GO TO TRAFFIC SCHOOL GET THE POINT EXPUNGED ONLY GO ONCE EVERY EIGHTEEN MONTHS SO IF YOU GET AT A POINT IN THE FIRST MONTH FOR LET'S SEE SPEEDING AND THEN YOU GET A CELL PHONE USAGE IN THE SECOND MONTH -- YOU CAN GET AT POINT ON YOUR PERSONAL LICENSE YOU WILL GO TODAY IT WOULD IT WOULD AFFECT YOUR COMMERCIAL INSURANCE RATES CAUSES THE THAT THAT -- THE SHARP INCREASE IN I'M WE'VE HAD MEMBERS WHO HAVE BEEN FIRED AFTER DRIVING FOR THIRTY YEARS AND SO -- WE WE RECOGNIZE IT'S A BIG PROBLEM BUT WE WE FAVOR LIKE I SAID THE INCREMENTAL APPROACH I THINK WE WOULD -- LIKE TO SEE WE CAME BACK AND REVISIT IT WOULD HAVE A -- WOULD HAVE A QUANTIFIABLE I'M YOU KNOW DECREASE IN THIS BEHAVIOR WILL WE BE I'M JUST RAISING PREMIUMS ON PEOPLE SO THANK YOU THERE'S NOT AN INCREMENTAL APPROACH TO DEATH SO I JUST WANNA LET YOU KNOW THAT MR DAILY

CERTAINLY THIS PROBLEM WHICH APPEARS TO BE A GROWING PROBLEM IF WE LOOK AROUND OVER ON A ON A FREEWAY OR A HIGHWAY OR EVEN ON A CITY STREET YOU SEE FOLKS WITH THEIR HEADS DOWN AND IT'S IT'S STARTLING IN ITS IT'S SCARY AND IT'S APPALLING AND IT'S DANGEROUS AND -- WE HAVE TO JUST TAKE STEPS TO TRY TO -- -- MAKE A BIGGER DEAL OUT OF THE OUT OF THE PROBLEM AND -- SO ALL KEEP TALKING TO THE OPPONENTS

SPONSORS SO WITH THAT -- ARE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU MISTER DALY AND THANK YOU FOR PICKING UP THIS BILL IS HERE I THINK I DID IT THREE TIMES SO FAR HEADING KNOWLEDGE IN AS YOU MENTIONED THE INFRACTION TWENTY AND FIFTY DOLLARS FOR THE SECOND OCCURRENCE YOU LOOK AT THE AMOUNT OF TICKETS THE HIGHWAY PATROL'S WRITING AT TWELVE THOUSAND TICKETS A MONTH AND YOU KNOW WE'RE THOUSAND OFFICERS DOWN IN THE HIGHWAY PATROL STATEWIDE SO COULD THEY BE MORE EFFECTIVELY USED IF PEOPLE WORK BREAKING THE LAW IN THIS MATTER AND IT WAS A LARGER DETERRENT SO THAT HE WOULDN'T DO THIS -- YOUR OWN AGAIN TWENTY FIFTY AND IT'S A THOUSAND DOLLARS TO LEADER IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IF YOU THROW SOMETHING OUT OF YOUR WINDOW IN YOUR CAR I'M NOT SEEING THE EQUITY IN IN IN A DETERRENT THERE IN THIS AND AS I MENTIONED I DON'T THINK THERE'S AN INCREMENTAL WAY TO DEATH I -- AS A FATHER WHO LOST A CHILD IN A CAR ACCIDENT NOT DUE TO DISTRACTED DRIVING BUT KNOWING THE CONSEQUENCES SO I REALLY FIRMLY BELIEVE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND PROPERLY TREATS THIS OFFENSE IS A MINOR INFRACTION IN FACT THE TICKET FOR DISTRACTED DRIVING WHO KILLS OVER THREE THOUSAND PEOPLE ANNUALLY AS LOW AS POSSIBLE PENALTY IN THE VEHICLE CODE THIS IS THE WRONG MESSAGE TO CALIFORNIA DRIVERS ANY DRIVERS OF ANY KIND OF VEHICLE ADDING A POINT WILL HELP DISCOURAGES DANGER DAYS BEHAVIOR IS NOT TO BE PUNITIVE IT'S TO BE A DETERRENT WE'RE NOT USING THIS AS A SLEDGE HAMMER TO STOP PEOPLE FROM DOING WE WANT THEM TO BE CONSCIOUS OF THE FACT THAT IF THEY DO DO IT AND ARE CAUGHT THIS IS GONNA HAPPEN AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR IN THIS PURPOSE AND WITH ALL DUE RESPECT THE OPPOSITION'S THERE'S NOT A SINGLE VIOLATION OF THE VEHICLE CODE WHERE YOU ONLY GET A POINT AFTER A SECOND VIOLATION THIS DEADLY ACTIVITY SHOULD BE TREATED LIKE ALL OTHER MOVING VIOLATIONS AND I FIRMLY BELIEVE IF YOU KILL SOMEBODY SHOULD BE CHARGED FOR MURDER MANSLAUGHTER I'M HAPPY TO JOIN US FOR THIS BILL WITH YOU IT WILL BE
