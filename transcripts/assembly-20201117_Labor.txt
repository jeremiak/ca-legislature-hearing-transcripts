IN TIMES OF A PANDEMIC WE ARE EVEN MORE CONCERNED THAT HEALTH AND SAFETY POLICY ARTICLE YOU PROTECT OUR WORKERS.

WHEN WE ALL LEFT THE CAPITAL EARLIER THIS YEAR WE WERE UNCLEAR REGARDING THE DEATHS OF THIS PANDEMIC THAT'S AFFECTS ON OUR COMMUNITIES ESPECIALLY. OUR WORKING FAMILIES WHO DON'T HAVE THE CHOICE TO WORK FROM HOME. ONCE UPON BY AND WE STILL ARE UNCLEAR ABOUT THE LONG LASTING EFFECTS OF THIS PANDEMIC BUT WE MUST BEGIN TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES THAT HAVE RESULTED ALREADY THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN IDENTIFIED. AND TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE. IT'S OUR DUTY TO SERVE AND PROTECT OUR COMMUNITIES AND THIS HEARING ALLOWS US AS LEGISLATORS TO SEE WHERE THE GAPS ARE IN THE PROGRESS. AND ENSURE WE'RE ALL DOING OUR BEST TO PUT THIS PANDEMIC BEHIND US AND TO HELP OUR WORKERS. I AM CURIOUS TO HEAR FROM OUR FIRST PANEL SPECIFICALLY FROM CAL OSHA. OTHER CRITICAL STEPS THEY'VE TAKEN TO PROTECT THE SAFETY OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE WORKERS. AND HOW THEY PLAN. TO IMPLEMENT PROVISIONS FROM. MY BILL AB SIX EIGHTY FIVE WHICH ENHANCED HELLO THIS IS A MINORITY TO INVESTIGATE. FIND REGULATE REQUIRE COMPLIANCE AND- EVEN SHUT DOWN BUSINESSES THAT REFUSED TO COMPLY. AND WHO ARE PUTTING THEIR WORK LIVES OF THEIR WORKERS IN DANGER. I ALSO WANT TO ESPECIALLY WELCOME EVERYONE FROM OUR SECOND PANEL AS WELL. AS YOUR VOICES AND THOSE OF YOUR MEMBERS ALLOW US TO KNOW FIRST HAND WHAT OUR COMMUNITIES ARE EXPERIENCING. FOR WHAT FOR THE LEADERSHIP OF U. F. C. W. AND CALIFORNIA LABOR FAT AND OTHER LABOR UNIONS WE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PASS A B. SIX EIGHTY FIVE. I AND OTHER. SIMILAR LEGISLATION THAT PROTECTS OUR MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES.

WHO'S THE CHIEF OF CAL OSHA AS WELL AS YOUNG SON PARKER THE CHEAP CHIEF DEPUTY SECRETARY SPEAKING FOR SPANISH IS AT THE LABOR AGENCY- ANIMAL AND WAS STEVEN KNIGHT EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF WORK SAFE AS WELL AS KAREN I'M FOR THE STOP ATTORNEY FORCING SO WE'RE GONNA START- SIX MINUTES- WITH- CHAS ALAMO SO- THE JAZZ RADIO. THANK YOU MA'AM. JEFF MEMBERS CAN YOU ME YEAH WE CAN HEAR YOU YOU. GOOD AGAIN MY NAME'S CHAS ALAMO I COVER LABOR EMPLOYMENT ISSUES THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND OUR OFFICE WAS ASKED TO PROVIDE A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF KALPOE SHOT. AND THE STEPS COUCHES TAKEN SINCE A PANDEMIC BEGAN FIRST FOR TODAY'S HEARING- WITH OUR TESTIMONY WE PREPARED A BRIEF HAND OUT I HOPE YOU HAVE THAT IN FRONT OF YOU. THEY HAD THAT IS AVAILABLE ON THAT THE COMMITTEE'S WEBSITE FOR THOSE THAT ARE INTERESTED. I'M SO ON ON THE- PAGE ONE OF THE HAND OUT I'M STARTING HERE THE CALIFORNIA. DIVISION OF OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH- IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PROTECTING WORKERS BY ENFORCING WORKPLACE SAFETY AND HEALTH STANDARDS- AND THEY DO SO- IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE FEDERAL OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY. AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION. OP THE DIVISION NOTICED HOW OSHA IS DIVISION WITHIN THE STATE'S DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS AND BOTH OF THEM ARE HEADQUARTERED IN OAKLAND- THE TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE. BUDGET PROVIDED A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS TO SUPPORT CAL OSHA- THE MAJORITY OF THIS FUNDING COMES FROM AN ASSESSMENT ON EMPLOYERS WORKERS COMPENSATION INSURANCE PREMIUMS- ON THAT THE SECOND LARGEST COMPONENT IS UP FEDERAL GRANT. FOR THIRTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE FEDERAL OSHA AND THE REMAINDER- IS VERY UPSET SPECIAL FUNDS. THAT THE BUDGET AUTHORIZED ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY POSITIONS FOR CALLOW SHOT STATEWIDE- OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS DIVISION HAS OPERATED WITH A RELATIVELY HIGH VACANCY RATE- THAT PICKING THE RIGHT RIGHT NOW HOVERS AROUND ALMOST TWICE AS HIGH AS THE STATEWIDE AVERAGE VACANCY. AND THE BAY AREA REGION DISTRICT OFFICES. AND ARE THE COUCHES ACTIVITIES CAN CAN SORT OF FALL UNDER FOUR BROAD CATEGORIES AS WE SEE IT- THE FIRST IS THAT CALLOSUM. CONDUCTS INVESTIGATIONS IN RESPONSE TO COMPLAINTS AND REPORTS OF INJURY OR ILLNESS- THE SECOND THAT IT IT CONDUCTS TARGETED INSPECTIONS ARE IN HIGH HAZARD INDUSTRIES. IT ALSO CERTIFIED HIGH RISK PROJECTS ARE ACTIVITIES AND FINALLY I MAKE CONDUCTS EMPLOYER OUTREACH THROUGH ITS CONSULTATION SERVICES BRANCH. ON ON PAGE TWO OF THE HAND OUT BECAUSE A SECURING IS FOCUSED ON FRONT LINE WORKERS OFFICE PREPARED A BIT OF BACKGROUND ON THE STATE'S FRONTLINE WORK FORCE- FRONTLINE WORKERS REGULARLY INTERACT WITH BOTH CUSTOMERS AND COLLEAGUES- WITHIN CLOSE PHYSICAL PROXIMITY AND AS- AS THE CHAIR MENTIONED AS A RESULT MAY FACE HEIGHTENED EXPOSURE TO THE CORONA VIRUS- DURING THE REGULAR WORK ACTIVITIES. THERE'S NO SET DEFINITION OF WHAT INDUSTRIES ARE OR ARE NOT FRONT LINE- TO WE ADOPTED ON A DESIGNATION FROM THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH- NEED SUMMER GUIDANCE ON TESTING PRIORITIES TO PREPARE THE TABLE AND I IN THIS SHEET. AND AS YOU CAN SEE TYPICALLY GOING INTO THE PANDEMIC THAT THERE WERE ABOUT FIVE POINT SEVEN MILLION CALIFORNIA WORKERS WORKING IN FRONT LINE INDUSTRIES- THE LARGEST INDUSTRIES WERE HEALTHCARE- FOOD SERVICES AS WELL AS- GROCERY CONVENIENCE AND DRUG STORES. AND YOU CAN SEE ON THE RIGHT HAND COLUMN OF THIS TABLE THAT AVERAGE ANNUAL PAY BY THESE INDUSTRIES VARIES CONSIDERABLY SO ON THE HIGHER END- YOU HAVE THE HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY PUBLIC SAFETY AND CORRECTIONS AS WELL AS PUBLIC TRANSIT. AND ON THE LOWER END OF THE PAY SCALE YOU HAVE THE JANITORIAL WORK FORCE- CHILD CARE WORKERS AGRICULTURAL WORKERS AND GARMENT WORKERS. WE THINK OUR ROUGH ESTIMATE IS IT TYPICALLY ABOUT ONE THIRD OF THE STATE'S WORK FIRST WORK IN THE FRONT LINE INDUSTRY. I'M THE TURNING TO PAGE THREE AND SPECIFIC TO CAL OSHA'S RESPONSE TO CHRONIC VIRUS PANDEMIC- CALLUSES TAKEN TWO PRIMARY STEPS SINCE A PANDEMIC BEGAN AND THE FIRST STEP WAS WORKING IN COLLABORATION WITH OTHER STATE ENTITIES ISSUING VARIOUS INDUSTRY SPECIFIC COVERT NINETEEN WORKPLACE. SAFETY AND HEALTH GUIDANCE SO GUIDANCE MEASURES SPECIFIC TO DIFFERENT TYPES OF INDUSTRIES. THE SECOND PRIMARY STEP AND ONE THAT I WANT TO FOCUS ON TODAY- HAS TO DO WITH HOW CALLOSUM RESPONDS TO COMPLAINTS THAT IT RECEIVES FROM AN EMPLOYEE'S. ON IN LIGHT OF ANTICIPATED WORKLOAD INCREASES DUE TO CULVERT NINETEEN- CAL OSHA HAS TEMPORARILY ADJUSTED ITS PROTOCOL FOR HOW IT RESPONDS TO COMPLAINTS. AND BY THAT I MEAN THAT GOING FORWARD WITH THIS HEIGHTENED WORKLOAD CAL OSHA WILL CONDUCT FEWER ON SITE INSPECTIONS IN RESPONSE TO COMPLAINTS AND INSTEAD ISSUE. MORE LETTERS TO EMPLOYERS HI IN RESPONSE TO COMPLAINTS THE LETTERS. IDENTIFY THE ALLEGED VIOLATION. AND REQUIRE THE EMPLOYER TO INVESTIGATE THE ALLEGATION AND SERENITY- ANY ANY SHORTCOMING- IF ONE IS FOUND. TYPICALLY CAL OSHA RECEIVES ABOUT TWELVE THOUSAND OF THESE EMPLOYEE COMPLAINTS A YEAR. AND TYPICALLY RESPONDS TO ABOUT 20% OF THOSE COMPLAINTS BY CONDUCTING AN ONSITE INSPECTION. SENSE THE CORONA VIRUS PANDEMIC BEGAN CAL OSHA'S HAS ALREADY RECEIVED MORE THAN ITS TYPICAL ANNUAL NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS A WORKLOAD AS WELL OP. BUT AT THE SAME TIME DUE TO THE ADJUSTED PROTOCOL I MENTIONED JUST A MOMENT AGO HELLO SAYS. TRIGGERING A COMPLAINTS ARE TRIGGERED TRIGGERING AN ONSITE INSPECTION IN ABOUT 6% OF CASES OF THIS IS BELOW THE TYPICAL TO A NORMAL CONDITION INSPECTION RATE OF TWENTY PERCENT. ON THOSE NUMBERS MIGHT JUMP OFF THE PAGE BUT I DO WANT TO CAUTION NOT TO PRE JUDGE CAL OSHA BASED ON THIS DISTINCTION THAT THERE COULD BE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BENEATH THESE NUMBERS THAT. THAT OP MISTER PARKER CAN SPEAK TO- AFTER MY TESTIMONY BUT IT IS ONE DISTINCTION THAT WE WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT- THAT THAT CARILLO SHUT HAS EXPERIENCED OVER THE LAST EIGHT MONTHS OR SO. ON THE FOURTH PAGE OF OUR HAND OUT- BRIEFLY SUMMARIZES THE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE INFORMATION ON THAT CITATIONS AND VIOLATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN ISSUED BY CAL OSHA SPECIFICALLY RELATED TO COVERT NINETEEN. I'M IN TOTAL THE DIVISION IS JUST ABOUT A MILLION DOLLARS AND CITATIONS AND THEY'RE LARGELY- IN JUDE AND MEAT PROCESSING INDUSTRY- AMONG THE GROCERY STORES. AND AT HEALTHCARE FACILITIES AS YOU CAN SEE IN THE IN THE FIGURE HERE ON ON PAGE FOUR- I WOULD POINT OUT THAT. ALL OF THE INDUSTRIES THAT HAVE RECEIVED CITATIONS- WHERE VIOLATIONS WERE FOUND ARE CONSIDERED FRONT LINE INDUSTRIES- AS THE CHAIR BROUGHT UP EARLIER. AND THE FINAL PAGE OF OUR HAND OUT IS SORT OF PARTING QUESTIONS THAT WE THINK THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS MIGHT WANT TO KEEP IN MIND AS THEY HEAR FROM OTHER EXPERTS AND THE PANELISTS- AND THESE QUESTIONS BONTA TWO CATEGORIES WE THINK. THE FIRST GROUP OF QUESTIONS. HAS TO DO WITH CAL OSHA'S CURRENT STAFFING LEVELS AND ITS VACANCY RATE AND WHAT THE STAFFING LEVELS ARE SUFFICIENT TO ENFORCE WHEN DOES THE STATE'S LABOR STANDARDS. UNDER NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES AND WHETHER THERE ARE SUFFICIENT UNDER THESE EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES. AND THAT THE SECOND GROUP OF QUESTIONS HERE IN THE HAND OUT HAS TO DO WITH CALLUSES COMPLAINT RESPONSE PROTOCOL. AND IN ESSENCE TRYING TO GET OUT WHAT THE PRACTICAL EFFECT. OF THE ADJUSTED COMPLAINT RESPONSE PROTOCOL HAS BEEN AT CAL OSHA THAT IS- CONDUCTING FEWER ONSITE INSPECTIONS AND RELYING MORE HEAVILY ON EMPLOYEE LETTERS- TRYING TO GET A SENSE OF WHAT THE PRACTICAL EFFECT THAT THAT ATTACK ON OUR WORKPLACE SAFETY AND HEALTH- IN THE LAST EIGHT MONTHS. WITH THE TIME THANK YOU AND- HAPPY AS I WILL BE ON THE LINE FOR QUESTIONS AT THE IN THE PANEL THANK YOU SO MUCH YES I DID MENTION EARLIER WILL HAVE. ABOUT FIFTEEN MINUTES FOR QUESTIONS OF THE ENTIRE PANEL AFTER ALL THE PANELISTS FOR A CHANCE TO SPEAK FOR THIS. FIRST ROUND SO THANK YOU A MEASURE ALL AMOUNT. OF MONEY AND- LET'S MOVE ON. TO DOUG PARKER OF THE CHIEF OF CAL OSHA TESTIFYING REMOTELY FROM OAKLAND AND YOUNG SON PARK. CHIEF DEPUTY SECRETARY CITIES COMPARTMENT AND INITIATIVES THAT THE LABOR AGENCY BY PHONE. AND YOU BOTH HAVE A TOTAL OF EIGHT MINUTES AND SO. FEEL FREE. TO DON'T DIVIDE YOUR TIME ACCORDINGLYTHANK YOU. A GOOD AFTERNOON- CHAIR KALRA VICE CHAIR FLOORS AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ABOUT CALLUSES RESPONSE THE COVERT NINETEEN. CRISIS I WANT TO FIRST THANK FIRST RESPONDERS AND ESSENTIAL WORKERS- AND ACKNOWLEDGE THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS AND SACRIFICES. DURING THIS DIFFICULT TIME- THEY HAVE CONTINUED TO. FEED US TRANSPORT US CONSTRUCTOR HOMES- NOW PROVIDE US WITH HEALTH CARE. AND THE ESSENTIAL NEEDS OF A SOCIETY AND- TOO MANY OF THEM HAVE LOST THEIR LIVES PROVIDING THOSE SERVICES. WE HAVE BEEN FOCUSED A CALLOUS ON PROTECTING THOSE ESSENTIAL WORKERS WHO. WHO FACE THE GREATEST RISKS AND WE HAVE ATTEMPTED TO MAINTAIN THE HIGHEST STANDARDS OF WORKER PROTECTION DURING THIS CRISIS- CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN A NATIONAL LEADER IN WORKER HEALTH AND SAFETY STANDARDS. AND MAINTAINING THOSE HIGH STANDARDS OF EMPLOYER RESPONSIBILITY HAS BEEN OUR GOAL AS WE APPROACH THESE CHALLENGES- I THOUGHT TO BE HELPFUL TO PROVIDE THE COMMITTEE WITH AN OUTLINE OF A HOW WE'VE RESPONDED TO THE CRISIS. WE DID REALIZE EARLY ON THAT WE HAD TO HAVE A STRATEGY THAT WAS GOING TO PROTECT WORKERS AND DO IT ON A SCALE WELL BEYOND OUR CAPACITY TO ADDRESS WITH THE NORMAL TOOLS OF DOING- AND- INSPECTIONS OR OTHER INTERVENTIONS ON A WORKSITE BY WORKSAFE BASIS- SO FIRST. WE KNEW WE WOULD HAVE TO LEVERAGE KNOWLEDGE AND TECHNICAL EXPERTISE- TO DEVELOP GUIDANCE AND NOW AN EMERGENCY OF A STANDARD. REGULATIONS THAT WOULD COVER WORKERS SO THAT- WORKERS AND EMPLOYERS WOULD UNDERSTAND HOW THEY COULD MINIMIZE RISK OF TRANSMISSION TO COVER NINETEEN- SECOND WE HAD TO FIGURE OUT. HOW TO DISSEMINATE THAT KNOWLEDGE BY FINDING WAYS TO EDUCATE AND CONDUCT OUTREACH WITH AS MANY EMPLOYERS AND WORKERS AS POSSIBLE. AND THIRD WE HAD TO FOCUS OUR ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS AND LEVERAGE THEM IN A WAY THAT WOULD PROVIDE THE GREATEST IMPACT FOR WORKERS WITH HE FINITE RESOURCES THAT- WE HAD TO COMMIT TO- THIS EFFORT- IN ADDITION OF THOSE THREE AREAS WE'VE ALSO HAD TO DEVOTE CONSERVATORY SOURCES TO CAPACITY BUILDING. A CALIPHATE BY ADDRESSING THE RELATIVELY HIGH VACANCY RATE- AND THE NEED FOR MORE PARTICULARLY INDUSTRIAL HIGH JANICE TRAINED TO RESPOND TO HAZARDS SUCH AS COVER NINETEEN. WITH RESPECT TO THE FIRST STRATEGY- IN MARCH AS THE- AS THE CONSULTANT WAS SAYING WE'D EXPECT AGAIN DEVELOPING- ACROSS AGENCY LINES AND- THROUGHOUT THE DAY WORKING WITH- CDPH COBRAS AND OTHER. OTHER AGENCIES IN THE STATE GUIDANCE FOR A WIDE RANGE OF INDUSTRIES- AND YOU KNOW WE'VE ISSUED- THE GUIDANCE FOR ALMOST FORTY DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES- THOSE ARE AVAILABLE ON OUR WEBSITE WE DON'T CONSIDER BY OUTRAGE TO EMPLOYERS ON THOSE ISSUES. WE'VE ALSO RECENTLY COMPLETED DEVELOPMENT OF AN EMERGENCY TEMPORARY STANDARD OF REGULATION THAT WOULD PROTECT CALIFORNIA WORKERS FROM COVER NINETEEN- THOSE WHO ARE NOT COVERED BY OUR AEROSOL TRANSMISSIBLE DISEASES STANDARD- THAT IS A- PROPOSAL THAT WILL BE VOTED ON BY THE STANDARDS BOARD ON NOVEMBER NINETEENTH. AND IF APPROVED WILL PROVIDE VERY STRONG BUT ALSO ACHIEVABLE PROTECTIONS FOR WORKERS- ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT WILL BE THE NEW CLEAR STANDARDS. ON EMPLOYER PROVIDED HOUSING AND TRANSPORTATION THAT WE'VE PROPOSED IN THAT EMERGENCY STANDARD- THESE ARE- ISSUES MOST COMMON IN AGRICULTURE- TO HELP REDUCE COVER NINETEEN TRANSMISSION IN THESE PARTICULAR HIGH RISK SITUATIONS- WE'VE ALSO DONE EXTENSIVE EDUCATION OUTREACH OUR SECOND STRATEGY- AND I'LL LEAVE- SOME OF THE ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION TO MY- COLLEAGUE- YOUNG SON PARK TO DISCUSS MORE OF THAT- BUT ONE OF THE THINGS I DO WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT- THAT ENSURES. THAT OSHA HAS DONE RECENTLY IS TO DEVELOP AN ONLINE TRAINING ACADEMY- SO THAT WORKERS AND EMPLOYERS CAN ACCESS ONLINE TRAINING ON THE CALLOSUM WEBSITE- EMPLOYERS CAN USE IT TO SUPPLEMENT THEIR TRAINING THEY CAN TAKE TRAINING ON HOW TO DEVELOP A PLAN IN THEIR WORKPLACE AND THEN WORKERS CAN DIRECTLY ACCESS TRAINING- SO THAT THEY KNOW WHAT THEY NEED TO DO TO PROTECT THEMSELVES. ON A THIRD STRATEGY- IT OUR STRATEGY HAS FOCUSED ON TARGETING THE HIGHEST RISK WORKPLACES AND INDUSTRIES. FOCUSING ON GEOGRAPHIC HOT SPOTS- AND THEN COMMUNICATED OUR FORSMAN EFFORTS TO THE PUBLIC TO FURTHER INCENTIVIZE COMPLIANCE. WITH OTHER CLOSE TO FIFTEEN HUNDRED COVER NINETEEN INSPECTION SINCE FEBRUARY- WE'VE ISSUED CITATIONS. THAT WILL HAVE A SIGNIFICANT DETERRENT THE FACT INCLUDING CITATIONS AT A MEAT PACKING PLANT. THAT ARE THE HIGHEST MONETARY PENALTIES IN THE COUNTRY. AND WE HAVE ACTIVELY PUBLICIZE OUR FORSMAN EFFORTS TO INCENTIVIZE THAT COMPLIANCE. OUR STRATEGIC FOCUS HAS BEEN IN HEALTHCARE AGRICULTURE RETAIL AND MANUFACTURING. HOME WE'VE ALSO MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS ON HIRING- AND HAVE- OF THE GIRL OF ABOUT SIXTY FIVE- HIRES THAT WE- I HAVE SET FOR- MAKING BY THE END OF THE YEAR WE HAVE THIRTY SEVEN HIRES- THAT WE HAVE EITHER- ON WHICH WE'VE EITHER MADE OFFERS ARE THERE IN THE FINAL STAGES OF. OF THE REVIEWER THE INTERVIEW PROCESS SO WE ARE- OPTIMISTIC THAT WE'LL REACH OUR COMPOSED AT LEAST TO THAT GOAL. WELL WE'RE ALWAYS LOOKING FOR WAYS TO DO OUR JOB BETTER WE BELIEVE OUR APPROACH IS THE RIGHT ONE AND- WE'VE MADE SIGNIFICANT IMPACT- I CAN- ADDRESS SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT WERE RAISED BY THE CONSULTANT. YEAH IN OUR QUESTION PERIOD- I'LL- RESERVE THERE ARE OTHER LEAVE THE REST OF THE TIME THAT WE HAVE FOR THIS PARK. THANK YOU. I AM OPTING FOR QUESTIONS AT THE END OF THE PANEL THE YOUNG SON PARK. MAY I THINK YEAH I THINK SHE'S TALKING ABOUT- MY PHONE. HEAR ME YES WE CAN HEAR YOU HELLO YES OKAY THANK YOU A GOOD AFTERNOON YES I WILL ELABORATE ON THE LABOR AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AGENCIES OUR PARTNERSHIP WITH OUR DEPARTMENTS TO REALLY- INCREASE AND ENHANCE THE PUBLIC AWARENESS AND EDUCATION OF WORKERS AND EMPLOYERS- ON THIS ISSUE AT THE STATE APPROPRIATED THIRTY TWO POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS Q. THE LABOR AGENCY AND DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS IN SEPTEMBER FOR THE EXPLICIT PURPOSE OF PROTECTING ESSENTIAL WORKERS AND THEIR FAMILIES AND ULTIMATELY SLOWING THE SPREAD. OF THE VIRUS YOU EDUCATION COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT AND ENFORCEMENT- SO WE ARE LAUNCHING A VERY COMPREHENSIVE CAMPAIGN THAT TAKES THREE STRATEGIC APPROACHES THE FIRST IS PUBLIC AWARENESS THROUGH MEDIA THAT WOULD BE BOTH TRADITIONAL AND DIGITAL MEDIA STRATEGIES THE SECOND IS COMMUNITY OUTREACH THROUGH TRUSTED MESSENGERS INCLUDING COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS OTHER NONPROFITS ARE THEY CAN REACH- WORKERS AND EMPLOYERS- IN THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND THEN THE THIRD ARE MORE- TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES FOR EMPLOYERS AND WORKERS Q. ENGAGE AND EITHER VIRTUAL WORKSHOPS OR OTHER INTERACTIVE SESSION TO REALLY LEARN HOW TO ADOPT. SOME OF THE GUIDELINES AND REQUIREMENTS AROUND A LABOR PROTECTIONS. TO PREVENT CO THAT. NINETEEN THE WORK- THE TO. THAT- WILL BE A IN THESE ASTER OUT AFTER IN WERE IT'S HELPING. ARE THEY ALL DOING PAGE LEAVE- AND OTHER- LEAVES BENEFIT ACCESS TO WORKERS COMP. AND ANTI RETALIATION PROTECTIONS- AND WE WILL ALSO BE PRIORITIZING REGIONS THAT ARE HARDEST HIT AS WELL AS THE HIGHER RISK INDUSTRIES MANY OF WHICH HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED. EARLIER IN THIS HEARING- I KNOW THAT I AM OVER TIME AND SO WANT TO BE AVAILABLE FOR ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS ABOUT THE SEPARATE THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ELABORATING ON THE COALITION'S EFFORTS AND- I'M SURE IT'LL BE A QUESTIONS AND- COMMENTS AFTER THE PANEL'S OF THANK YOU BOTH THE MISTER PARKER IN HIS POEMS PARK- NOW CAN MOVE ON. TO COMPLETE THE PANEL THE FINAL TO. SEE KNIGHT EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF WORKSAFE FALL BY KAREN I'M FREE A STAFF ATTORNEY FOR WORKSAFE AND THEY ALSO HAVE. EIGHT MINUTES SURE LOOKS LIKE WE HAVE MISTER KNIGHT ALREADY READY TO GO ON THE VIDEO. YES THANK YOU CHAIR KALRA NUMBERS- STEVEN KNIGHT WITH WORKSAFE WHERE AN ORGANIZATION DEDICATED TO PROMOTING THE RIGHTS OF ALL CALIFORNIANS TO A SAFE AND HEALTHY WORKPLACE. ALL MAKES AND- GENERAL OVERALL. COMMENTS IN MY COLLEAGUE CARRYING. WORK IS MARKED BY MASSIVE DISASTERS THAT SPUR ACTION THE TRIANGLE SHIRTWAIST FIRE NINETEEN ELEVEN IS A NOTABLE EXAMPLE THE CORONA VIRUS PANDEMIC IS THE HEALTH AND SAFETY DISASTER OF OUR LIFETIME. WE NOW KNOW THEIR WORK PLACES ARE MAJOR SITES OF COVERT TRANSMISSION WORK PLACES ARE RECEIVING AND GENERATING COVERT CASES SPREADING INFECTIONS AND SENDING WORKERS HOME TO THEIR FAMILIES. JUMMA REPORTS AS MANY AS HALF OF ALL ADULTS ARE ENDANGERED BY WORKPLACE EXPOSURE. QALISYA WAS HARDLY THE ONLY GOVERNMENT AGENCY UNDER PREPARED FOR THIS CORONAVIRUS. A SINGLE WIDELY REPORTED CITATION EARLY IN THE PANDEMIC. I COULD HAVE GOTTEN THE ATTENTION OF EMPLOYERS AND ACROSS THE STATE AND IMPROVE PUBLIC HEALTH AMID A PANDEMIC THAT IS HAVING AN OUTSIZED IMPACT ON COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. YEAH WE SAW NO ENFORCEMENT PUBLIC ENFORCEMENT UNTIL SEPTEMBER. THE BOTTOM LINE IN PROTECTING WORKPLACES WORKERS VOICES ARE VITAL. SOME EMPLOYERS SUBJECT TO THE NECESSARY FOCUS SOME WORK PLACES BUT WE ARE ALL DEEPLY IMPACTED DISADVANTAGED AND PAYING A COST AS WE STRUGGLE TO SAVE THE LIVES OF CALIFORNIANS. WORKSAFE STANDS WITH A POWERFUL MOVEMENT OF WORKERS AND UNIONS WHO HAVE ADVOCATED SINCE SPRING FOR AN EMERGENCY TEMPORARY STANDARD. FOR TEMPORARY DISEASES OR ETS WHICH THE STATE ALREADY HAS FOR MEDICAL WORKPLACES AS CHIEF PARKER JUST MENTIONED CAL ISSUE DELIVERED A DRAFT LAST WEEK IT'LL BE VOTED ON THIS THURSDAY. THE PROPOSAL IS BASED ON SOUND SCIENCE AND PUBLIC HEALTH PRINCIPLES IT BUILDS ON EXISTING REQUIREMENTS SUCH AS THE INJURY AND ILLNESS PREVENTION PROGRAM. IT IS CONSISTENT WITH THE GUIDANCE ISSUED BY CAL OSHA AND HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AS WELL AS RECENT LEGISLATION. WE HOPE LEGISLATORS AND THE PUBLIC WILL URGE THE STANDARDS BOARD TO APPROVE THIS RULE. BUT THE COMPANY T. S. WILL MEAN ITTLE IF CALIFORNIANS HINDERED BY VACANCIES IN A LIMITED ABILITY TO MEET WORKERS WHERE THEY ARE. I WAS TROUBLED TO SEE DIRECTOR HAGEN RECENTLY TELL THE SENATE COMMITTEE THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAS ALL THE RESOURCES IT NEEDS. CALIFORNIA WITH A WORKFORCE OF NINETEEN MILLION AND OVER A MILLION WORKPLACES HAS A HUNDRED NINETY THREE INSPECTORS AND DOZENS OF VACANCIES. THE STATE HAS MORE FISHING GAME WARDENS. WE NEED FULL STAFFING OF CALIFORNIA NOT A PRI PAN DEMICHELIS BETTER LEVEL APPROPRIATE FOR TODAY'S THREATS AND OPPORTUNITIES. CALIFORNIA'S WORKERS MUST BE PROTECTED FROM HAZARDS FOR THE LONG TERM. IN CALIFORNIA HAS TO BE AT THE TABLE AS DECISIONS ARE MADE TO CONTROL AND CONTAIN THIS VIRUS. BASED ON WHAT WE HEARD IN LAST WEEK'S ADVISORY COMMITTEE CAPACITY ISSUES ARE BEING TAKEN SERIOUSLY. THE STATE LABOR AGENCIES PARTNERSHIP WITH WORKER ADVOCATES AND WAGING OUR ENFORCEMENT ISA GREAT MODEL. AND WORKSAFE IS REVIEWING LEGISLATIVE IDEAS TO ENSURE THAT THE AGENCY HAS ALL THE AUTHORITY IT NEEDS TO SITE THE LABOR CODE. AND ENFORCE A WINDBREAKER RIGHT TO VIOLATED. IN A GROSSLY INEQUITABLE GLOBAL ECONOMY WE URGE LEGISLATORS AND AGENCY TO DEMAND AND DEPLOY THE RESOURCES AND TOOLS NECESSARY. TO PROVIDE THE STATE'S VULNERABLE WORKERS WITH THE ENFORCEMENT OF PROTECTION THAT WE ALL NEED. THANK YOU. YEAH I'M A MISSILE FREEBIE BEGIN WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. UHHUH GOOD AFTERNOON COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS CORINNE I'M FREE AND I AM A STAFF ATTORNEY AT WORK SAFE TODAY WILL BE SPEAKING ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF LISTENING TO WORKERS AND THE CRITICAL ROLE COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS PLAY SINCE THE START OF THE PANDEMIC. WHEN DISASTERS STRIKE CALIFORNIA LIKE RECENT WILDFIRES THE CURRENT AND CURRENT PANDEMIC. ORGANIZATIONS OF HAD TO PIVOT TO MEET THE PRESSING DEMANDS OF THEIR COMMUNITIES. RUSSERT'S ORGANIZING HELPS KEEP WORKING COMMUNITIES TOGETHER DURING TIMES WHEN PEOPLE FEEL ISOLATED AND UNHEARD. THIS IS NOT MOTIVATED BY GOOD WELL ALONE TOO OFTEN THESE EFFORTS ARE NEEDED TO FILL GAPS IN SERVICES CREATED BY UNDERSTAFFED AND UNDER SOURCE RESOURCE STATE AGENCIES LIKE CAL OSHA. THIS HAS CERTAINLY BEEN THE CASE WITH WORKPLACE PROTECTIONS AND EDUCATION ORGANIZATIONS AND COALITIONS HAVE STEPPED IN TO SUPPORT WORKERS BY GIVING OUT INFORMATION RESOURCES AND EVEN PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT WHEN THEY HAVE THE CAPACITY TO DO SO. THIS HAS BEEN NECESSARY IN THE ABSENCE OF COMPREHENSIVE ENFORCEMENT OF WORKPLACE HEALTH AND SAFETY RIGHTS. SOMETIMES THESE GROUPS ARE FILLING GAPS CREATED BY NEGLIGENT EMPLOYERS AS WELL THIS IS BEEN HAPPENING DURING WILDFIRES WHEN VOLUNTEERS HAD TO DISTRIBUTE MASKS TO WORKERS WHO ARE NOT GETTING THEM FROM THEIR EMPLOYERS. COMMUNITY GROUPS HAVE DEMONSTRATED HW POWERFUL THEY ARE BY STEPPING INTO THIS ROLE BUT THIS IS NOT THEIR FUNCTION AND IT DEPLETES LIMITED RESOURCES. TO BEGIN TO ADDRESS THIS LONG STANDING PROBLEM WORKERS CENTERS AND OTHER WORKER ADVOCACY ORGANIZATIONS ARE COMING TOGETHER TO ENGAGE WITH CAL OSHA LEADERSHIP AND A SYSTEMATIZED WAY. THIS HELPS BUILD TRUST IN THE AGENCY AT THE GRASSROOTS LEVEL AND ENABLES THE DIRECT FLOW OF INFORMATION FROM WORKERS. HOWEVER WITHOUT SUPPORT COMMUNITY GROUPS ARE FEELING EXHAUSTED. OUTRAGE EDUCATION AND PARTNERSHIPS ARE ALWAYS VALUABLE TOOLS AND THEY'RE ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL DURING A PANDEMIC BUT RESOURCES ALSO MUST BE ALLOCATED TO ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE CONNECTING WITH CAL OSHA. WE ARE ENCOURAGED BY THE ADVENT OF THE LABOR AGENCIES NEW OUTREACH AND EDUCATION CAMPAIGNS IN PARTNERSHIP WITH COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS INCLUDING THE PLAN TO FIND ORGANIZATIONS FOR THEIR PARTICIPATION. THIS IS A PIVOTAL CHANGE THAT WILL BUILD TIES BETWEEN AGENCIES AND GRASSROOTS ORGANIZATIONS WE ARE POSITIVE AND HOPEFUL THAT THIS WILL LEAD TO SAFER WORKPLACES. AT WORK SAVE WE HAVE SEEN THE VALUE OF STRONG AGENCY PARTNERSHIPS WITH COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS AFTER GRASSROOTS ORGANIZATION. BUILT TRUST WITH JANITORIAL WORKERS WORKERS FILED A HEALTH AND SAFETY COMPLAINT FOR AN ARRAY OF OSHA VIOLATIONS BECAUSE THE AGENCY VALUED AND RESPECTED THE WORKER AND ADVOCATES DURING THE COMPLAINT PROCESS. WORKERS WERE EMPOWERED THROUGH THIS PROCESS ONE OF THE WORKERS HAS NOW BECOME A PROMOTE DORA AND HER COMMUNITY. THE BOTTOM LINE. IS TO ACHIEVE WORKER SAFETY AND WE NEED TO CENTER WORKERS VOICES AND ENCOURAGE WORKER POWER. SILENCED AND DISEMPOWERED WORKERS WHO FEAR RETALIATION AND LOSING THEIR JOBS OUR WORKERS AT GREATER RISK OF INJURY OR DEATH ON THE JOB. THIS SUGGESTS WE NEED A STRONG ANTI RETALIATION STATEMENT FROM STATE LEADERS CALIFORNIA CANNOT TOLERATE EMPLOYERS WHO RETALIATE AGAINST WORKERS REPORTING HAZARDS ARE EXERCISING OTHER WORKPLACE RIGHTS. AS MY COLLEAGUE STATED THE CORONA VIRUS PANDEMIC IS THE OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH CRISIS OF OUR LIFETIME. CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO CONTINUE ITS BOLD LEADERSHIP AND HEALTH AND SAFETY WORKSAFE LOOKS FORWARD TO PARTNERING WITH CAL OSHA AS WE MOVE FORWARD TOWARDS A SAFER CALIFORNIA FOR ALL WORKERS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MISTER KNIGHT M. AND THANK YOU TO WORK SAFE- FOR YOUR WORK IN EMPOWERING AND EDUCATING WORKERS THIS IS TRULY REMARKABLE AND APPRECIATE IT. AND- I'LL MAKE MENTION THE FACT ONE OF MY APPRECIATION OF THE GOVERNOR FOR. SIGNING MY BILL TO HELP PROTECT WORKERS AGAINST RETALIATION SO I THINK IT SPEAKS TO THE- LAST POINT FROM SOME PRETTY. I'M AND I'M GONNA I'M GONNA I JUST WANNA ASK ONE QUESTION OPENED UP TO EVERYONE ELSE AND I HAVE A COUPLE MORE LATER BUT- FOR MR ALAMO- MR ALMOST ALEJO THANK YOU SO I JUST HAD A QUICK QUESTION TRYING TO LEAD THIS OFF- AS TO WHETHER. WE HAVE ANY IDEA. BUT THE INFECTION NUMBERS ARE IN EACH INDUSTRY BECAUSE YOU CAN GIVE A GOOD BREAK DOWN. OF FRONTLINE WORKERS BY INDUSTRY- MANY OF WHOM ARE LOW WAGE OR LOWER WAGE WORKERS AND AS YOU INDICATED IT'S ABOUT A THIRD OF THE WORKFORCE SO DO WE HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT THE INFECTION NUMBERS ARE IN EACH INDUSTRY. TO OUR KNOWLEDGE THERE THERE ISN'T YET A STATEWIDE RESOURCE THAT WOULD PROVIDE US THE INFORMATION ABOUT INFECTION RATES BY INDUSTRY OBVIOUSLY WE DO WISH WE HAD- THAT KIND OF- DATA AS A RESOURCE- IN RESPONDING TO THE PANDEMIC- I WILL MENTION THAT THAT IS. ONE OF THE COMPONENTS OF AB SIX EIGHTY FIVE THAT WAS DISCUSSED EARLIER- COMING INTO THE NEW YEAR REQUIREMENTS THAT LOCAL. COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICERS ARE COMMUNICATE THOSE INFECTION RATES BY INDUSTRY TO THE STATE TO HAVE THIS. SORT OF- WRAPAROUND VIEW OF- THE INFECTION RATE BY INDUSTRY BUT THIS TIME THERE ARE SOME COUNTIES THAT ARE REPORTING THIS INFORMATION IN BITS AND PIECES BUT WE WEREN'T ABLE TO AGGREGATE A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF. DATA POINTS TO PROVIDE SOMETHING TO THE COMMITTEE TODAY. YOU KNOW I WOULD APPRECIATE THAT AND I AND I THINK THAT YOU SPEAK EXACTLY TO MY POINT OF HOW GRATEFUL I AM FOR AB SIX FIVE IN SOME AREAS. NOW WE CAN ACTUALLY GET THAT I'D GET INFO HAVE CONTINUITY AND CONSISTENCY OF THE DATA WE'RE GETTING STATEWIDE WHICH OF COURSE DATA IS THE KEY- IN COMBATING ANY ISSUES AT THE WORK SITE PARTICULARLY WHEN IT COMES TO. THE PANDEMICS OF THANK YOU FOR THAT AND I WANT TO AGAIN EXPRESS MY APPRECIATION TO SOME AREAS. AB SIXTY FIVE IN THE. GOVERNOR FOR SIGNING IT INTO LAW. AND I ASK HIM QUESTIONS IN THE LET ME ASK IF ANYONE. OF THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS OR ANY OF THE MEMBERS HERE. BUT LIKE TO ASK ANY QUESTIONS OR MAKE ANY COMMENTS. AND WE DO HAVE HEROES OF A ROBBERY THIS. IS HERE WITH US AS WELL AS I MENTIONED EARLIER WAS ON HIS WAY OVER. ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS THE SERVICE. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER KALRA- ON PAGE. FOUR- IT HAS A LIST OF VIOLATIONS AND CITATIONS RELATED BUT NINETEEN. ARE YOU BEFORE BECOMING AN ASSEMBLY MEMBER I WAS AN ATTORNEY AND REPRESENTED MANY WORKERS COMPENSATION- INJURED WORKERS AND I DO KNOW THAT OFTENTIMES AN EMPLOYER WOULD GET A CITATION BUT BY THE- TO. THERE WAS VERY LITTLE THAT WAS ACTUALLY PAID SO MY QUESTION IS- OF THE CITATIONS THAT THE ONE. MILLION DOLLARS IN CITATIONS THAT ARE LISTED THERE HOW MUCH WAS ACTUALLY COLLECTED. I SHOULD POINT OUT MAYBE AT THIS POINT THAT THESE CITATIONS WERE ISSUED VERY RECENTLY ONLY IN THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS- SO COLLECTIONS HAVEN'T GONE FORWARD I WOULD DEFER SPECIFICS TO MISTER PARKER ON THOUGH I DO KNOW THAT. THE EARLIEST GROUP OF CITATIONS HAVE BEEN APPEALED IN MOST CASES ALREADY ON THOSE PEELS I BELIEVE ARE ARE STILL OUTSTANDING GIVEN HOW RECENTLY- THE CITATIONS WERE ISSUED. FORGET IT- MISTER PARKER DID YOU WANT TO RESPOND TO THAT OR OR TO ADD TO THAT ANSWER. THAT ANSWER IS CORRECT THESE ARE. CAN YOU YES WE CAN THE THOSE CASES ARE ALL STILL- EITHER ON APPEAL BECAUSE THE EMPLOYER IS CONTESTED THEM- ARE THEY'VE YET TO BECOME FINAL ORDER CERTAINLY ALL THE LARGER ONES THAT HAVE BEEN CONTESTED SO WE WON'T KNOW FOR AWHILE WHAT THE- FINAL OUTCOMES ARE. I WILL ADD THAT THE- THAT THE APPEALS BOARD THAT HEARS THESE CASES THEY ARE GOING TO BE EXPEDITING COVERT NINETEEN CASES OF THEY WILL BE- HIM MOVED TO THE FRONTLINE ALONG WITH OTHER HIGH HIGHER PRIORITY CASES. THANK YOU RIGHT- THERE WAS MUCH DISCUSSION AND ALSO IN THE DOCUMENTS ARE PROVIDED TO US ABOUT THE VACANCIES IN THE VACANCY RATE OF 20% AND ADD TO THE FACT THAT AS IT IS I READ IT THERE WOULD BE YOU WILL ATTEMPT TO FILL SIXTY FIVE POSITIONS NOW AND ANOTHER SEVENTY POSITIONS. IN THE SPRING OF NEXT YEAR- HOW HAS THIS AFFECTED YOUR ABILITY AT ENFORCEMENT. TO HAVE SUCH A SUCH A HIGH VACANCY RATE. SO TO HAVE A GREAT. WELL IT CERTAINLY HAS AN IMPACT- BECAUSE WE HAVE FEWER PEOPLE TO DO THE WORK WE HAVE TO- PULL INSPECTORS INTO THE OFFICE TO CONDUCT- ADMINISTRATIVE DUTIES IF WE DON'T YOU KNOW IF WE HAVE TEMPORARY SHORTAGES OF A OF ADMINISTRATIVE STAFF DID A- VACANCY RATES ARE EVER YOU KNOW IF THE VACANCY RATE IS LOW AND THEN WE HAVE. AN ABSENCE THEN YOU KNOW SOME OF THAT CRITICAL WORK STILL HAS TO BE DONE- SO IT DOES DEFINITELY HAS AN IMPACT IT HAS MORE IMPACT IN SOME PLACES THAN OTHERS IT JUST DEPENDS ON WHAT HE- STAFFING LEVELS ARE IN- THOSE PARTICULAR PARTS OF THE STATE- HELP YOU AND THERE'S ALSO JUST THE ISSUE OF WHAT THE- MIX OF EXPERTISE IS WITHIN A PARTICULAR OFFICE SO- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT IN THESE CASES IS TO HAVE PEOPLE WITH. A HEALTH EXPERTISE- AND SO THAT'S- THAT'S BEEN A- A SKILL SET THAT WE'VE LOST OVER THE YEARS AND SOMETHING THAT I HAVE- COMMITTED TO- IMPROVING EVEN BEFORE COVERED AND SO WE'VE CONVERTED A NUMBER OF OUR SAFETY CAN- POSITIONS TO INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE POSITIONS ARE ACTIVELY RECRUITING. NATIONALLY FOR THOSE- TO FILL THOSE JOBS AND WE'VE HAD VERY GOOD RESULTS IN TERMS OF THE FOLKS THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO RECRUIT AND HAVE APPLIED TO THOSE POSITIONS. PLEASE WALK US THROUGH. THE BUDGET INCLUDED THE FUNDING FOR ALL OF THESE POSITIONS. WHAT GOES THROUGH. SO THAT I CAN BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW IT'S POSSIBLE TO HAVE SO MANY VACANCIES WHEN YOU HAVE THE MONEY TO FILL THEM. THE- THE ISSUE OF VACANCIES AS ONE THAT IS- BEEN AN ISSUE FOR SOME TIME IT CALIPHATE PRECEDES MY- MY APPOINTMENT TO BE THE CHIEF- IT BEGAN WITH A REVIEW IS YOU'RE PROBABLY FAMILIAR WITH WITH THE- STATE PERSONNEL BOARD IN THE STATE AUDITOR. WHICH CONCLUDED THAT THERE WAS A NEED TO REVAMP THE HIRING PROCESS AND SORT OF RE LEARN APPROPRIATE MERIT BASED HIRING PROCESSES AT DR GENERALLY- INCLUDING CALLOSUM. AND SO WE'VE BEEN IN AN EXTENSIVE REBUILDING PROCESS FOR SOME TIME TO- WE TRAIN OUR STAFF ON HIRING PROCESSES TO RE WRITE DUTY STATEMENTS TO- WE LEARN- THESE PROCESSES AND- THE EFFECT OF HAVING TO. BUT SO MANY HIRING- PACKAGES THROUGH THE PROCESS ALL AT ONCE- IT CERTAINLY IS- IS BEEN A STRAIN ON THE SYSTEM AND IT'S BEEN AN ONGOING LEARNING PROCESS. WE ARE- SEEN RESULTS NOW IT TAKES SOME TIME BUT WE ARE DEFINITELY SEEING RESULTS AND MAKING THOSE HIRES- IT IS CERTAINLY FRUSTRATING FOR ME AS HEAD OF THIS. DIVISION HAVING RESPONSIBILITY- BOTH PROFESSIONALLY AND FEELING A GREAT PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY TO THESE WORKERS WHO ARE EXPOSED TO THESE HAZARDS- TO SEE THAT GAP MYSELF BETWEEN THE- BUDGET THAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE FOR STAFF AND THE- AND THE LIMITS ON THE STAFF THAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE TO SEND OUT IN THE FIELD. I WOULD. SUGGEST COMMUNITY COLLEGES OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES CAN TAILOR THEIR TRAINING TO THE NEEDS I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THAT THAT BE USED. IF I MAY ON THE FIRST PAGE OF THE BACKGROUND BRIEF THAT YOU PROVIDED TO US. YOU TALKED ABOUT A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE DEMAND FOR ENFORCEMENT AS A RESULT OF COVERT NINETEEN- AND YOU'RE SET FOR FEBRUARY ONE TO THE END OF OCTOBER YOU HAD TWELVE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY EIGHT COMPLAINTS. I PERHAPS I MISSED IT IN THE DOCUMENTS BUT I DIDN'T SEE WHAT THAT COMPARED TO LAST YEAR THE YEAR BEFORE. THERE'S AN INCREASE BUT GIVE US A BETTER IDEA WHAT WHAT WHAT KIND OF INCREASES THAT. WHAT WE NORMALLY HAVE- TEN TO TWELVE THOUSAND COMPLAINTS IN A YEAR SO- I BELIEVE BY THE END OF OCTOBER THIRTY FIRST. WE HAD EXCEEDED THIRTEEN THOUSAND TOTAL COMPLAINTS SINCE. FEBRUARY ONE- AND ABOUT EIGHT THOUSAND OF THOSE WERE COVERED NINETEEN RELATED- I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT THAT COMPLAINTS ARE NOT THE ONLY SOURCE OF OUR WORKLOAD WE ALSO. HAVE A STATUTORY MANDATE TO INVESTIGATE SERIOUS ILLNESSES THAT ARE REPORTED. AND FATALITIES THAT ARE REPORTED- SO WE'VE HAD- AS OF OCTOBER THIRTY FIRST TO SIX HUNDRED FORTY FATALITIES REPORTED TWO HUNDRED FIFTY OF THOSE WERE COVERED NINETEEN RELATED AT LEAST AS THEY WERE REPORTED AND- FOUR THOUSAND OVER FOUR THOUSAND SERIOUS INJURIES AND ILLNESSES OF WHICH THOUSAND ARE COVERED RELATED. AS WELL AS A NUMBER OF REFERRALS AND OTHER- OTHER ACTIVITIES THAT HAVE TRIGGERED INSPECTION SUCH AS MEDIA REPORTS AND REPORTS FROM OTHER AGENCIES SO- IT IS ONE PART OF OUR- OUR WORKLOAD. AND I JUST WANT TO MAKE A COMMENT REGARDING THE INVESTIGATIONS TO SENDING OUT A LETTER AS OPPOSED TO IN PERSON INVESTIGATIONS. CAUSES GREAT CONCERN FOR ME- IT'S YOU GET A LETTER IT'S LIKE A SLAP ON THE WRIST- AS OPPOSED TO HAVING AN IN PERSON. INVESTIGATION BY CAL OSHA THAT WAS ALWAYS IT WAS ALWAYS A BIG DEAL AND IT SHOULD BE A BIG DEAL- I JUST WANTED TO MAKE THAT COMMENT AND IF I MAY MISTER CHAIR- TO. TO STEVEN KNIGHT AND CORINNE I'M FREE. CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW. I WANT TO. THANK YOU FOR THE WORK YOU DO. YOUR WORK IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT HAVING ADVOCATES FOR WORKERS- HAVING IT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT NINETEEN MILLION WORKERS AND THAT THE FACT THAT THE FACT THAT YOU PROVIDED TO US. HELP TREMENDOUSLY AS WE ARE EVALUATING WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE WITHIN THE AGENCY BUT GETS UP WITH THE ENTIRE STATE OF CALIFORNIA KNOWING HOW WE TAKE CARE OF OUR WORKERS. ESPECIALLY OUR FRONT LINE WORKERS SO I DO WANT TO THANK YOU AND MS I'M FREE FOR THE WORK THAT YOU DO- AND ALSO APPRECIATE VERY MUCH THE COMMENT FROM IS ON FREE. ABOUT LISTENING TO THE WORKERS I APPRECIATE THAT THE CHAIR HAS INCLUDED THAT IN TODAY'S HEARING THAT WE WILL HEAR FROM THE WORKERS BUT I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK. THANK YOU. THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER SO- YEAH THANK YOU SOME AREAS AND MISTER KNIGHT WHILE YOU WHILE WE HAVE-YOU HERE- ALSO ONE EXPRESSED APPRECIATION AND- YOU SPOKE TO AS WELL AS- YES I'M PRETTY ABOUT THE ART REGION EDUCATION ASPECT AND- AND FRANKLY I THINK SHE- SHE RECEIVED MENTION ABOUT. THE THAT SHE'S A TRUMP FEELING EXHAUSTED I THINK THAT'S LIKE P. TWENTY TWENTY THEY WERE ALL KIND OF WINGS OFSTED JUST. TRYING TRYING TO DO EVERYTHING THAT WE CAN ESPECIALLY AS IT APPLIES. TO ANSWERING THE WORKERS THAT ARE ALLOWING SO MANY OF US. TO STAY AT HOME. WITH OUR FAMILIES- IT AS RUBY ASKED TO. CAN DO THAT IS BECAUSE OF THESE WORKERS AND- MR NIGHT OF A QUESTION. OR OR MAYBE. MORE OF A KIND OF STRATEGICALLY. HOW DO YOU SEE. EDUCATION OUTREACH LIKE. THAT THAT WOULD BE MOST AFFECTED EFFECTIVE. IN FACILITATING WORKER AWARENESS AND ENSURING EMPLOYEE COMPLIANCE AND- THEY AND I KNOW THERE'S A WIDE RANGE WORKERS BUT- SPEAKING SPECIFICALLY FOR EXAMPLE TO FARMWORKERS AND- WITH THE- SOME. DE AB TWENTY THREE A HAS DIFFERENT TYPES OF REQUIREMENTS IN TERMS OF OUT REACH. WHAT DO YOU FEEL WOULD BE THE MOST EFFECTIVE USE OF THE I CAN GUESS YOU SEE THIS NEW TOOL- NOT ON THE GROUND BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE DO LEGISLATION HERE MISS RESURGENT. BUT ON THE JOB ALL THE PACKAGE OF BILLS TO DO NOT REACH A FARMWORKERS AND BUT WHAT WHAT DO YOU HOW DO YOU SEE IT PLAYING OUT. IN REAL TIME OVER THE NEXT FEW MONTHS BUT COME JANUARY TO JANUARY FIRST. I NEED TO HEAD THINK THERE'S JUST NO SUBSTITUTE FOR RESOURCES AND- PARTNERING WITH TRUSTED COMMUNITY ADVOCATES- AND THAT IS YOU KNOW THE WORK THAT. THE WORKSAFE FACILITATES WITH THE BROAD COALITIONS THAT HAVE COME TOGETHER. AROUND- ALL OF OUR INITIATIVES- SO- YOU KNOW THE SURVEY FROM TOWARD- AND EXAMPLES THE WORK THAT'S BEEN DONE AROUND THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT TO- TO MEET- AND LIFT UP COMMUNITY LEADERS AND- REACH PEOPLE. THROUGH AVENUES AND LOOK IN LANGUAGES THAT THEY- CAN- WHERE THEY CAN BE MET AND IT'S JUST NO REAL SUBSTITUTE FOR THIS THE HARD WORK THE RESOURCES THE SHOE OTHER- THE- THE PARTNERSHIPS- THAT ARE ALREADY THERE- THE EXIST BUT THEY ARE FRAGILE AND UNDER A LOT OF STRESS. AS CORINNE- VERY ELOQUENTLY ALREADY TESTIFIED. THANK YOU SO MUCH- AS A MEMBER RIVAS DID YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FOR THIS FOR ANYONE ON THIS PANEL. I DON'T BUT I REALLY APPRECIATE THE RESPONSES AND- YOU KNOW. SURE THAT WE UNDERSTAND- THE PROCESS BEFORE BECAUSE CREDIT WE POINT TO- A LOT OF- OUR CONSTITUENTS IN THE WORK THAT WE DID LAST YEAR. THANK YOU AND I DON'T WANNA. EXPRESS MY APPRECIATION TO THE FIRST PATENT THIS FIRST PANEL FOR THE WORLD YOU'RE ALL DOING INFORMATION PROVIDING US AND AGAIN PLEASE REACH OUT TO THE COMMITTEE COMMITTEE MEMBERS OTHER MEMBERS AS A RESOURCE ESPECIALLY THERE ARE THINGS THAT YOU THINK THAT WE NEED TO BE OING THAT WE'RE NOT DOING. OF BUDGET POLICY OTHER THINGS THAT YOU NEED TO AND WE HEARD FROM MISTER PARKER YOU KNOW WITH OSHA WE ARE ALL FANS OF OSHA AND THE ABILITY FOR OSHA TO BE ABLE TO DO ITS WORK NOT AS A WAY OF PUNISHING EMPLOYERS BUT AS A WAY OF EDUCATING EMPLOYERS AND MAKING SURE THEY'RE DOING EVERYTHING THEY CAN. TO SUPPORT WORKERS WE ALL HAVE TO BE ON THE SAME TEAM ESPECIALLY DURING THIS PANDEMIC AND SO. I APPRECIATE- EVERYONE ON THIS PLAN. FOR THE WORK THAT YOU'RE DOING AND I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK. WITH ALL OF YOU- BUT IT AND THE CONTINUING CHALLENGES. BOB WE'RE GONNA BE SEEING IN THE MONTHS AHEAD. SO THANK YOU ALL TO THE UP TO OUR FIRST PANEL- ACTUALLY. THE MACHINE I TAKE THAT BACK IF THERE'S ANYONE ON THE PHONE LINES AT ONCE A CALL ASKING QUESTIONS. MAKING COMMENTS. I THINK WE HAVE- VICE CHAIR FLORA. FOR ANYONE IF NOT THAT'S FINE BUT I WANT TO MAKE SURE WE GET THE OPPORTUNITY. BEFORE I MOVE ON. OKAY AND ALL THE MEMBERS HAVE YOU KNOW THAT THEY HAVE MYSELF ON THE CONTAX MEAN FOR SOME REASON. IT'S NOT GETTING THROUGH FEEL FREE TO DO THAT MY PHONES RIGHT HERE. I'M PAYING ATTENTION TO IT TO MAKE SURE I'M NOT MISSING ANYONE- BUT- I KNOW THAT WILL HAVE. MEMBERS TUNING IN AT VARIOUS TIMES AND I KNOW ALSO THAT- THE PRESENTATION ITSELF IS WORTHWHILE AND- THERE MAY NOT BE FURTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. FROM MEMBERS THAT ARE TUNING AND REMOTELY. SO- OKAY SO THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH FOR THE FIRST PANEL. WE WILL NOW MOVE ON TO THE SECOND PANEL IN FIGURE WAS SOMETHING THAT- MISS I'M FREE SAID THE IMPORTANCE OF LISTENING TO WORKERS AND THAT'S WHAT. THE SECOND PANEL IS ABOUT- WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON TO THE SECOND PANEL FRONT LINE WORKERS FROM FOR. INDUSTRIES. AND FIRST UP- AND I'LL JUST INTRODUCE THE FALL YOU SEE HERE. OKAY YES- FIRST UP- WE WILL BE HEARING FROM. OR WILL GETTING AN OVERVIEW OF THE BROKER PERSPECTIVE FROM MID STEIGER WITH THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION WHO HAS UP TO SIX MINUTES SO WHEN WE GO AHEAD AND START WITH MITCH WHENEVER HE'S READY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MITCH DYER WITH THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY TODAY THE COCA NINETEEN PANDEMIC PRESENTS A LOT OF CHALLENGES THAT ARE. IN MANY WAYS UNIQUE AND SOMETHING THAT NONE OF US HAVE EVER SEEN IN OUR LIFETIMES BUT IN OTHER WAYS IT'S REALLY JUST AN INTENSIFIED MORE VISIBLE VERSION OF WHAT WORKERS ALWAYS FACE IN TRYING TO STAY SAFE ON THE JOB. WE'VE SEEN A VARIETY OF EMPLOYER RESPONSES FROM SOME THAT DO EVERYTHING THAT THEY CAN AND EVERYTHING THAT THEY KNOW OF TO KEEP WORKERS SAFE BUT- FOR EVERYONE OF THOSE THERE'S AN EMPLOYER THAT. DOES LITTLE TO NOTHING THAT EVEN GOES BEYOND THAT TO SHAME WORKERS WHO TRY TO STAY SAFE THREE PP OR MASKS OR EVEN RETALIATE AGAINST THOSE WHO REPORT HAZARDS OR GET SICK ON THE JOB. WHICH LEADS US ALL TO RELY ON CALLOW SHOW AND THE LABOR MOVEMENT AND GROUPS LIKE WORKSAFE ENCOURAGES INDIVIDUALS TO PROTECT WORKERS WHERE EMPLOYERS WANT. AND TO FOCUS ON CALIFORNIA FOR A SECOND THE ISSUE OF STAFFING HAS BEEN MENTIONED A LOT AND THAT'S REALLY ONE THAT WE SEE AS THE PRIORITY HERE THAT THE 20% VACANCY RATE. HAS BEEN A PRETTY STUBBORN ISSUE AT LEAST AS LONG AS WE'VE BEEN PAYING ATTENTION TO WHAT THE 20% RATE HAS BEEN THERE FOR AT LEAST A DECADE DESPITE THE BEST EFFORTS OF VARIOUS AGENCY HEADS AND THAT'S DEFINITELY ENCOURAGING TO HEAR THAT. THERE REMAINS A FOCUS AND HOPEFULLY THIS TIME WE CAN MAKE SOME SIGNIFICANT STEPS TOWARDS SOLVING IT BUT WE THINK IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO GET A LITTLE BIT INTO THE WEEDS OF EXACTLY WHAT THAT LACK OF STAFFING. NEEDS FOR WORKERS AND THE PRIMARY PROBLEM THAT IT CAUSES IS AS WAS MENTIONED A FOCUS ON LETTER INVESTIGATIONS AS OPPOSED TO ONSITE INSPECTIONS. AND JUST SOME QUICK NUMBERS IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO QALISYA CONDUCTED TWELVE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY INSPECTIONS IN PERSON INSPECTIONS AND ONLY SENT EIGHT HUNDRED AND FORTY EIGHT LETTERS. LAST YEAR BEFORE CODE NINETEEN EVER- IT CALIFORNIA THERE WERE SEVENTY HOUSE FIVE HUNDRED. INTO AND OVER SEVEN THOUSAND LETTERS THAT WERE SENT. SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE CHART THAT MAPS OUT HOW MANY THAT DON'T EACH YEAR YOU CAN SEE IT KIND OF DOING THIS. AND IT'S GOTTEN TO A POINT EVEN BEFORE COVERT NINETEEN HAPPENED. WHERE THEY WERE DOING ABOUT THE SAME% NUMBER OF LETTERS AS ONSITE INSPECTIONS AND IS ONSITE INSPECTIONS ARE REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT. AN EXPERT FROM CALIFORNIA IS THERE IN PERSON THEY ASKED TO SEE THE INJURY ILLNESS PREVENTION PLAN THEY ASKED TO SEE THE FORM THREE HUNDRED. THEY GET A REALLY GOOD SENSE OF JUST HOW BAD THINGS ARE AT THAT EMPLOYER AND YOU CAN SEE IF THERE ARE ANYTHING IF THERE'S ANYTHING ELSE GOING WRONG. YOU JUST DON'T GET THAT WITH THE LETTER INVESTIGATION AND THOUGH THE LETTERS ARE ARE DEFINITELY NOT USELESS THEY DO DO SOMETHING WE NEED TO SEE MORE ON SITE INSPECTIONS. ESPECIALLY WITH COCA NINETEEN TO MAKE SURE THAT WORKERS ARE KEPT SAFE. AND IT ALSO REALLY AFFECTS THE- THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THINGS LIKE THE COVER NINETEEN STANDARD THAT'S UP FOR THE STANDARDS BOARD ON THURSDAY. THEN IT'S A GREAT STANDARD IT'S A VERY WELL WRITTEN. WE VERY MUCH HOPE THE STANDS FOR DISAPPROVAL. BUT WHILE IT DOES GIVE EMPLOYERS MORE CLEARLY AS FAR AS WHAT THEY NEED TO DO TO KEEP WORKERS SAFE. IT WILL GENERATE A LOT OF COMPLAINTS I WOULD JUST KIND OF. GO ON THE PILE OF COMPLAINTS THE COLORS SHE JUST DOESN'T HAVE THE RESOURCES TO DEAL WITH. AND IN THAT SENSE. IT REALLY IS GOING TO BE LESS EFFECTIVE THAN IT COULD BE IF WE DID HAVE THE STAFFING THAT WAS NECESSARY. ALSO WANTED TO MENTION THAT IN RECENT YEARS EMPLOYER APPEALS OF CITATIONS. HAVE REALLY GOTTEN OUT OF CONTROL. AND THAT HAS LED A LOT OF INSPECTORS TO HAVE TO DO ALL SORTS OF PAPERWORK. WHEN THEY DO MORE SERIOUS CITATION SERIOUS WILL FOR. ONCE IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT THE CITATION CAN SURVIVE THE LEGAL CHALLENGE. AND SO THAT'S ANOTHER FACTOR IN THE MINDS OF THE INSPECTOR WHEN THEY'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO RESPOND TO SOMETHING THAT. HAS BEEN REPORTED. THAT IF THEY DO THIS AS AN IN PERSON INSPECTION. THEY'VE GOT TO SPEND A LOT OF TIME FILLING OUT PAPERWORK THAT'S TIME THAT THEY COULD BE SPENDING DOING SOMETHING ELSE MAYBE SENDING LETTERS MAYBE INSPECTING OR DANGER SUPPORT. SO IT'S NOTHING THAT PUTS HIM IN AN IMPOSSIBLE POSITION THAT LIMITS HOW WELL THEY CAN KEEP WORKERS SAFE. THERE'S ALSO AN ISSUE WHERE MANY INSPECTORS ARE COMFORTABLE DOING IN PERSON INSPECTIONS. SO WE NEED TO WE NEED TO DO A LOT TO MAKE SURE THAT. THOSE INSPECTORS HAVE THE TRAINING AND THE PP THEY NEED TO KEEP WORKERS SAFE. ALL OF WHICH KIND OF ADDS UP TO A DEMORALIZING EXPERIENCE FOR A LOT OF INSPECTORS THAT. IT STANDS TO REASON THAT DEMORALIZE WORKERS ARE LESS LIKELY TO STAY AT THE JOB AND SO THAT'S GOING TO INTENSIFY THE STAFFING STRUGGLES. BUT IT'S NOT ALL ABOUT CAL OSHA ANOTHER BIG PROBLEM WE SEE WRITING OVER ALL OF THIS IS THAT. FRANKLY NOT ENOUGH WORKERS ARE IN UNIONS. AND BEING IN A UNION CAN BE PRETTY DECISIVE IN DETERMINING. WHETHER OR NOT. YOU WAS A WORKER EVEN ABLE TO SURVIVE THIS PANDEMIC. WORKERS IN UNIONS AS YOU'RE ABOUT TO HEAR FROM THE NEXT WITNESSES- HAVE THE BENEFIT OF ALL SORTS OF INTERVENTIONS FROM THINGS LIKE. A UNION HELPING TO ENSURE IMMEDIATE COMPLIANCE WITH EXISTING RAGS AND GUIDANCES. PROVIDING PP WHEN EMPLOYERS WANT TO EDUCATING WORKERS ON THEIR RIGHTS. AND A LOT OF OTHER STUFF THAT A UNION CAN TAKE TO HELP PROTECT WORKERS. BUT WITHOUT A UNION. WHEN A COMPLAINT IS FILED. K. OFF GOES. THE TO GET A LIST OF WORKERS TO TALK TO. OBVIOUSLY THE EMPLOYER. IS NOT GOING TO PICK THE VOCAL ACTIVIST TYPES THAT ARE COMPLAINING ABOUT THE HAZARDS ARE GOING TO PICK THE ONES THAT ARE. LESS LIKELY TO DO THAT. AND SO THEY'RE GOING TO GIVE A DIFFERENT INTERPRETATION OF WHAT'S HAPPENING TO THE INSPECTOR. IT'S ALMOST LIKE THE SYSTEM IS KIND OF DESIGNED TO. DOWNPLAY THE SEVERITY OF THE HAZARD AND THAT'S SOMETHING ELSE THAT'S GOING TO HELP THE PANDA EXPRESS. HELP WORK HELP MORE WORKERS GET THE VIRUS AND PUT US ALL IN A WORSE POSITION. ALSO WITHOUT A UNION WORKERS ARE HARLEM WHOLE LOT MORE LIKELY TO WIND UP MISCLASSIFIED. AND OBVIOUSLY MISCLASSIFIED WORKERS HAVE NO CAL OSHA PROTECTIONS AT ALL. BUT BY AND LARGE. THE PIPE BY FAR THE BIGGEST ISSUE THAT- THAT'S AT THE TOP WORK HERE IS THAT WORKERS. AREN'T IN UNIONS. HAVE LITTLE IF ANY PROTECTIONS AGAINST RETALIATION. THAT THERE IS IT IS OBVIOUSLY ILLEGAL TO RETALIATE AGAINST WORKERS FOR REPORTING HEALTH AND SAFETY HAZARDS BUT- THE REALITY IS THAT IT TAKES SO LONG TO PROCESS THESE CASES. THAT MOST WORKERS. YOU KNOW IF THEY GET FIRED FOR REPORTING SOMETHING THEY STAY FIRED FOR YEARS IF EVEN IF THEY DO STAY INVOLVED WITH THE CLAIM. AND MOST OF THE TIME THEY NEED TO GET A NEW JOB AND THEY JUST MOVE ON. AND THAT'S WHAT WE THINK IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO DEAL WITH AND- ON THAT FRONT. SO BOTH SHORT AND LONG TERM. JUST ONE OF THE CLOSE BY SAYING WE DON'T REALLY THINK IT WHATEVER SOLUTIONS WE COME UP WITH WHATEVER NEW STANDARDS OR NEW PROTECTIONS. NOTHING IS GOING TO WORK VERY WELL WITHOUT THREE THINGS. ONE MORE STAFFING AT CAL OSHA. TWO MORE IN PERSON INSPECTIONS AND THREE OF MORE WORKERS AND UNIONS. WE'RE DOING ALL WE CAN IN THE THIRD ONE AND WE DEFINITELY STAND READY AND COMMITTED TO HELP. HELPING ALL STAKEHOLDERS EVERYONE IN THIS BUILDING HELP MAKE SURE THAT. WE SAW THE FIRST ONES AS SOON AS POSSIBLE SO THAT WE CAN. GET OUT OF THIS PANDEMIC AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MR STEINER- INVOLVED WILL HOLD FOR QUESTIONS AT THE END OF THE PANEL. AFTER EVERYONE HAS A CHANCE TO SPEAK AND SO THAT YOU CAN HANG UP THAT BE GREAT- AND SO WE HAVE FOUR. SECTORS WE'RE GONNA BE HEARING FINAL GONNA START WITH AGRICULTURE. AND WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO IS I BELIEVE. THAT MISTER FERNANDEZ WANTS TO GO FOR A IS GONNA BE GOING FIRST- AIRBENDER FERNANDEZ BUT I ALSO BELIEVE OR BEEN TOLD THAT WE MAY NOT HAVE DIRECT IMMEDIATE TRANSLATION FOR MISS AYE DOLLARS OVER GOING TO DO IS. WE'RE GONNA GO TO ALBERTO FERNANDEZ A STRATEGIC CAMPAIGN COORDINATOR WITH YOU HAVE W. THE UNITED FARM WORKERS FOUNDATION AND THEN RE OCULAR A WORKER REPRESENTATIVE- SO WE HEAR FROM FROM FROM- MISS OCULAR. AND THEN- AFTER RECYCLER SPEAKS WILL GO BACK TO MISTER FERNANDEZ TO TRANSLATE- THE STATEMENT FROM- MISS OCULAR SO WHAT IS A BACK AND FORTH A LITTLE BIT AS I WAS ON THE PHONE BUT AS WE CAN SEE HERE IN THE ROOM. MISTER FERNANDEZ IS ON THE SCREEN SO- PLEASE MISS FERNANDEZ ONCE GO AHEAD AS A TOTAL OF EIGHT MINUTES AND OBVIOUSLY HAVE THAT CUSHION. FOR TRANSITION TIME AS WELL. THANK YOU GERMAN CAR LIKE GOOD AFTERNOON. I'M A BIT OF A NON THERE'S A SET OF FARMWORKERS AND AN ADVOCATE WITH THE UFW FOUNDATION. IT IS SAID THAT CRISIS HIGHLIGHTS THE BEST AND WORST IN PEOPLE. THIS IS AS TRUE FOR PEOPLE AS IT IS FOR LEADERS AND OUR STATE AS A WHOLE. FARMWORKERS SEE THE PANDEMIC AS SHEDDING LIGHT ON A TALE OF TWO CALIFORNIA'S. THERE ARE FARMWORKERS AND THEN THERE'S A CALIFORNIA FOR ALL. CALIFORNIA IS A LEADING AGRICULTURAL STATE IN THE NATION AND IS HOME TO THE LARGEST NUMBER OF FARMWORKERS AND BY THESE NUMBERS YOU WOULD THINK THAT CALIFORNIA'S AGRICULTURE IS FLOURISHING. IT IS IT IS FLOURISHING BUT JUST NOT FOR FARMWORKERS HERE THE FAX FARMWORKERS ARE UNDOCUMENTED AND IN THE STATE THEY DON'T QUALIFY FOR UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE FOR PERMANENT PAID SICK LEAVE OR FOR CALIFORNIA FOR ALL HEALTH CARE COVERAGE. FARMWORKERS ARE NOT CONSIDERED FOR STATE HAZARD PAY DESPITE WORKING IN ONE OF THE MOST DANGEROUS JOBS IN THE COUNTRY. MANY FARMWORKERS ARE PAID UNDER THE TABLE AND CHEATED OUT OF THEIR WAGES. AND THEN WHEN WE CONTINUE TO ALLOW COMPANIES IN CALIFORNIA TO SHUT DOWN AND START OVER WHEN THEY REFUSED TO PAY. UNDER THE H. TWO A. VISA PROGRAM GUEST WORKERS ARE INDENTURED SERVANTS AND THE STATE'S HOUSING CODE STILL ALLOWS FOR BARRACKS STYLE HOUSING TO SET TO BE SUBSIDIZED AND TO SUBSIDIZE YOUR PRESSION OF PEOPLE. WHILE PERFORMING BACKBREAKING WORK TO FEED THE NATION FARMWORKERS ARE EXPOSED TO EXTREME HEAT PESTICIDES TO THE RISK OF KOBE NINETEEN AND TO THE HARMFUL AIR. DUE TO THE WILDFIRES. THEY WORK IN EVACUATION ZONES WITH NO MASKS IN THE NAME OF SAVING COMMODITY FROM THE FIRE WHILE MANY STILL FACE FOOD INSECURITY AT HOME. NOW YOU HAVE TO ASK YOURSELF WITH ALL THE PUBLIC STATEMENTS ABOUT WHAT HAS BEEN DONE FOR FARMWORKERS WHY ARE THE STILL THE FAX AS WE SIT HERE TODAY. WHY IS THERE SO MUCH DISPARITY IN POWER DISPARITY IN INCOME DISPARITY IN HEALTH CARE COVERAGE. DISPARITY IN WORKING CONDITIONS AND DISPARITY AND THE LAWS THAT GOVERN OUR STATE AGRICULTURAL SYSTEM. LIKE OTHER HISTORIC INJUSTICES THE SYSTEM IS NOT BROKEN RATHER THE AGRICULTURAL SYSTEM IS DESIGNED TO KEEP FARMWORKERS FROM EVER RECEIVING THE ECONOMIC RECOGNITION THEY DESERVE. WE OFFER THE FOLLOWING FARMWORKERS NEED CHANGES IN THE EXISTING STATE PROCESS FOR COLLECTIVE BARGAINING ELECTIONS SO THAT WHEN FARMWORKERS ORGANIZED THEY CAN LIFT THEMSELVES UP AND NEGOTIATE FOR THEMSELVES. THE CURRENT VOTING AND ELECTION PROCESS IS MEANT TO SUPPRESS VOTES AND THE NIGHT OUTCOMES ALL TO PERPETUATE THE ECONOMIC OPPRESSION THAT HAS EXISTED SINCE THE EARLY DAYS OF SLAVERY. IT MUST CHANGE AND WE SHOULD BE LEADING THE CHANGE TO CHANGE IT. ADDITIONALLY FARMWORKERS ARE CONSISTENTLY WRITTEN OUT OF STATE LAWS THAT LEADERS THEMSELVES NEGOTIATE WE NEED LEADERS THAT WILL PRIORITIZE HUMANS AS MUCH AS A PRIORITIZE COMMODITIES. THAT WON'T ALLOW WORKERS TO BE UNPROTECTED WHILE. KING GRAPES IN FIRE ZONES. THAT WILL REVIEW THE STATE LAWS THAT THEY'RE NEGOTIATING AND ASK THEMSELVES IF THESE LAWS WORK FOR FARMWORKERS AND LEADERS WHO WILL ENFORCE CURRENT LAWS AND ENSURE FINES ARE COLLECTED NOT JUST ISSUED. THE ESSENTIAL WORKER DESIGNATION DOES NOT MEAN THAT FARMWORKERS GET MORE PROTECTIONS. THE AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY HAS RECEIVED BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN KOBE NINETEEN LEGISLATION YET FARMWORKERS ARE STILL WITING FOR MASKS. WAITING FOR SAFE SOCIAL DISTANCING PRACTICES AT WORK WAITING FOR BASIC SANITATION SUPPLIES AND FOR KOBE NINETEEN SCREENINGS AND FOR PORTABLE BATHROOMS TO BE CLEANED. WE HOPE YOU CAN JOIN US AS WE LOOK TO CHANGE THE SYSTEMIC INJUSTICES BUILT IN OUR EXISTING LAWS AND THAT YOU THINK OF US WHEN YOU WRITE THE NEXT STATE SET OF LAWS THAT IMPACT FARMWORKERS THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH HI MISTER FERNANDEZ- WILL HEAR ON THE PHONE FROM HER MARIA I DO A LOT. ONE OF. THE NUMBER OF NINETY AGGIE LAST.

GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS MY IDEA I'VE BEEN A FARM WORKER FOR NINETEEN YEARS AND I LIVE IN MY THAT I CALIFORNIA. WHEN I'M WORKING IN THE GRAFTING OF ALMOND TREES SO THAT THE PLANTS DO NOT DRIVE. DOING THIS WORK. THERE IS NO SHADE TO SPARE YOU FROM THIS HOT FROM THE HOT SUN. THE LAND IS VERY HOT AND YOU'RE ON YOUR KNEES BECAUSE YOU CANNOT BEAR BEING BENT OVER ANY LONGER. THE LUMPS OF DIRT. HURT YOUR KNEES AND YOUR FINGERS AND SOMETIMES THEY EVEN BLEED. UNFORTUNATELY MY FAMILY ENDED UP CONTRACTING THE VIRUS AROUND THE TWENTY EIGHTH OF JUNE IS WHEN WE ALL BEGAN TO FEEL ILL FEEL ILL ON THAT DAY MY HUSBAND AND I WENT TO WORK TO HARVEST TOMATOES I DID NOT FEEL WELL TO START THE DAY I DIDN'T HAVE MUCH OF AN APPETITE FOR BREAKFAST AND I FELT TIRED. THAT DAY. WE WERE ASKED TO DO MORE WORK THAN WE USUALLY DO IT. BUT I FEEL DIZZY AND I DO NOT THINK THAT IT WOULD- THAT I WOULD BE ABLE TO CONTINUE. ON THE CAR RIDE HOME I WAS EXPERIENCING COLD SHIVERS. SO THAT SO I ASKED. FOR THE HEAT TO BE TURNED ON. WHEN I GOT HOME I HAD A HIGH FEVER AND I TOOK PILLS TO EASE MY SYMPTOMS. BUT I STILL FELT VERY ILL. MY HUSBAND WENT TO WORK THE NEXT DAY BUT HE ALSO RETURNED WITH A HIGH FEVER. ON THE THIRTIETH MY HUSBAND AND I WENT TO GET TESTED AND WE TESTED POSITIVE WITH OVER NINETEEN. WITHIN THE WEEK. OUR CONDITIONS GOT WORSE. AROUND TWO PM AROUND TWO AM ONE NIGHT. WE HAD A BIG SCARE. MY HUSBAND WAS DELIRIOUS WITH HIS BODY ACHES AND HE BEGAN TO SHAKE UNCONTROLLABLY. WE ALMOST CALLED AN AMBULANCE BEEN THANK BUT THANKFULLY HIS BODY STOPPED SHAKING AND HE WAS FINALLY ABLE TO REST THAT NIGHT. HARVESTING TOMATOES IS TOUGH WORK IT REQUIRES YOU TO LIFT HEAVY BUCKETS FULL OF TOMATOES WAIT UPWARDS TO FORTY FIVE POUNDS AND YOU HAVE TO KEEP UP PACE OR ELSE YOU'LL GET LEFT BEHIND THE CONSTANTLY MOVING TRUCK. WE IS FARMWORKERS IN IMMIGRANTS CONTRIBUTE A LOT TO THE STATE AND TO THE COUNTRY. TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE HAVE WHAT THEY NEED pAT HOME BE IT VEGETABLES FRUITS THE ALMOND MILK THE PEOPLE DRINK. AND TOMATOES FOR HAMBURGERS AND PIZZAS. THIS HAS AFFECTED EVERYTHING BEFORE BEFORE COVER NINETEEN CHILDREN WERE IN SCHOOLS AND WE WERE ONLY PAID AND WE ONLY PAY TO TAKE CARE OF THEM FOR A LITTLE WHILE. RIGHT NOW THE SCHOOLS ARE CLOSED WHERE ELSE WOULD YOU LEAVE YOUR CHILDREN. PEOPLE ARE BEING AFFECTED AND BECAUSE OF BECAUSE OF THIS ISN'T GONNA END WORKERS ARE GOING TO STILL BE AFFECTED LONG TERM. WHAT DO WE HAVE TO DO. OUT OF NECESSITY WE TAKE OUR CHILDREN TO BE TAKEN CARE OF EVEN IF WE DON'T HAVE ANY MONEY LEFT. WE HAVE OTHER EXPENSES TOO THINGS ARE MORE EXPENSIVE SOMETIMES THEY'RE EVEN DOUBLED IN PRICE. WE ARE LIMITING OURSELVES TO IN SO MANY WAYS. THE MONEY WE ARE ABLE TO TAKE HOME. IS ENOUGH TO PROVIDE FOR FOOD. EMPLOYERS DON'T TELL US ANYTHING ABOUT SIX PAID SICK LEAVE. THEY TELL US THAT IF WE FEEL BAD THAT WE SHOULDN'T COME. TO WORK SO THAT OTHER PEOPLE DON'T GET SICK THEY DON'T TELL US THAT IT THAT THEY WOULD PASS OR NOT. IT IS NECESSARY TO HAVE PAID SICK LEAVE FOR ALL FARMWORKERS BECAUSE WE HAVE A GREAT NECESSITIES. WE HAVE CHILDREN TO SUPPORT LIKE JUST LIKE EVERYONE ELSE. I AM A FARM WORKER. IF A FARM WORKER WERE TO GET SICK. WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO COUNT ON THAT SUPPORT WELL WORK WHILE WE RECOVER. AT MY WORK THEY TELL YOU TO KEEP YOUR DISTANCE DON'T BE CLOSE. YOU HAVE TO BE COVERING YOUR MOUTH YOU HAVE TO BE DOING THIS AND THAT. BUT THEY DON'T GIVE US THE EQUIPMENT THAT WE NEED. WE HAVE TO GET IT OURSELVES I'VE BROUGHT HAND SANITIZERS MASS BANDANNAS FROM HOME OTHERWISE THEY WON'T LET YOU GO GO TO WORK. THEY DEMAND THINGS FROM YOU BUT THEY DON'T GIVE THEM TO YOU. WHAT SHOULD ONE DO OTHER THAN TO BUY THE EQUIPMENT OURSELVES BECAUSE WE NEED TO WORK. SINCE THE BEGINNING OF A PANDEMIC A LOT WAS DISCUSSED ABOUT FARMWORKERS BEING ESSENTIAL WORKERS. BUT THEY DIDN'T SPEAK ABOUT PROTECTIONS FOR THOSE ESSENTIAL WORKERS WE HAVE RIGHTS AND WE DESERVE EQUAL PROTECTIONS WE ARE NOT ANIMALS TO BE WORKED AND EXPLOITED WE HAVE CHILDREN SUPPORT. WE HAVE NOTHING WE HAD JUST WORK. PLEASE RECOGNIZE US. WE DO SO MUCH FOR THIS COUNTRY AND WE ARE HERE OUT OF ECONOMIC NEED THANK YOU AND GOD BLESS YOU. THANK THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER FERNANDEZ AND THANK YOU TO MARIA OCULAR FOR THE POWERFUL. OF TESTIMONY. I'M ANY GAMBLE I HAVE TIME FOR ANY PARTICULAR QUESTION COMMENTS AFTER ALL THE PANELISTS SPEAK- NEXT WE HAVE. OF IN FOOD PRODUCTS OF THE FOOD SECTOR FOR FOOD PROCESSING SO THE NEXT COUPLE GOING TO BE THAT KIND OF FROM THE AGRICULTURE FOR THE FARMER CARE TO THE FURTHER IN THE FOOD CHAIN SO TO SPEAK AND SO- NEXT UP WE HAVE AMBER BAUER OF THE SECTOR DIRECTOR OF UNITED FOOD AND COMMERCIAL WORKERS WESTERN STATES COUNCIL. AND JOSE GOOS MON AND REMATCH OF ARIA FROM FARMER JOHN'S- THERE. FROMOLD- TESTIFYING REMOTELY FROM. OAKLAND TO LOS ANGELES THEY HAVE EIGHT MINUTES OF TOTAL TIME AND ALL OF COURSE ALLOW FOR THE TIME FOR TRANSLATION AS WELL IN ADDITION TO THAT. MISTER. MY NAME IS AMBER BAUER I REPRESENT I WORK FOR UNITED FOOD AND COMMERCIAL WORKERS AS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR WE REPRESENT ABOUT A HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND WORKERS ALL ALONG THE FOOD CHAIN INCLUDING THOSE IN RETAIL FOOD- PHARMACISTS PHARMACY TECH WORKERS THOSE IN AGRICULTURE AND MEAT PACKING AND- FOOD PRODUCTION I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL FOR HOLDING THIS HEARING ON THIS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TOPIC AND TIMELY ISSUE OF WORKPLACE HEALTH AND SAFETY DURING THE PROJECTED UPTICK IN THE COVE IN NINETEEN CASES OVER THE WINTER. FOOD SECTOR WORKERS ARE FACING A HEALTH CRISIS OF FOOD AS A HEALTH AND SAFETY CRISIS THAT IS COSTING THEM THE LIVES THEIR LIVES AND THE LIVES OF THEIR FAMILIES THESE ARE THE WORKERS THAT KEEP OUR GROCERIES SHELVES STOCKED GROW AND PROCESS OUR FOOD AND KEEP OUR ECONOMY RUNNING ESSENTIAL WORKERS AND OUR MEMBERS ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY LATINO BLACK IMMIGRANT WOMEN AND LOW WAGE WORKERS WHO REALLY BORNE THE BRUNT OF THE FOOD SECTOR WORKPLACE COBIT NINETEEN OUTBREAKS. THESE WORKERS EXPERIENCE WHAT YOU JUST HEARD WHAT YOU WILL HEAR AFTER ME IS OUR UNION HAS HEARD COUNTLESS INSTANCES OVER THE PAST EIGHT MONTHS WHERE EMPLOYERS ARE NOT FOLLOWING CAL OSHA GUIDANCE EMPLOYERS HAVEN'T NOTIFIED WORKERS OF WORKPLACE EXPOSURE AND THEY WORKERS HAVEN'T BEEN TOLD ABOUT THEIR SICK LEAVE RIGHTS AND EMPLOYERS HAVEN'T ENFORCED SOCIAL DISTANCING MEASURES WITHIN THE WORKPLACE AND PROVIDED THEIR WORKERS WITH PP. THE SOLUTION FOR THIS IS REALLY THAT WE NEED BETTER FASTER TARGETED ENFORCEMENT. RAPID IN PERSON RESPONSE TO COVERT NINETEEN COMPLAINTS WE'LL SHOW WORKERS AND EMPLOYERS THAT ENFORCEMENT IS REAL AND COMPLIANCE IS MANDATORY. ENFORCEMENT NEEDS TO BE TARGETED AND BASED ON RISK OR VIOLATIONS. DATA FROM EIGHTY SIX EIGHTY FIVE WOULD YOU RATHER HAVE HEARD ABOUT IT SENSIBLY DURING THIS HEARING- AGAIN THANK YOU TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER RAZ FOR- HER AUTHORING THAT BILL WILL GREATLY HELP WITH TARGETED ENFORCEMENT. HELLO CHAU HAS ISSUED PENALTIES TO EMPLOYERS BUT THE AMOUNTS ARE NOT ENOUGH. OF A DETERRENT TO EMPLOYERS TO FIX THEIR WORK PLACE INTO AN ISSUES. INCREASE PENALTIES WILL CREATE A TRUE DETERRENT FOR BOTH VIOLATIONS OF HEALTH AND SAFETY GUIDELINES AND RETALIATION AGAINST WORKERS WHO SPEAK OUT. FINALLY WE NEED GREATER COORDINATION BETWEEN THE STATE AND COUNTIES. WE NEED TO EMPOWER WORKERS THE BEST WAY TO PROTECT WORKERS IS TO EMPOWER THEM WORKERS NEED EDUCATION ON THEIR RIGHTS IN THE WORKPLACE AND HOW TO BRING FORWARD A COMPLAINT. WORKERS KNOW THEIR WORKPLACES BETTER THAN ANYONE ELSE THEIR ON SITE DAILY THEY ARE THEY CAN IMMEDIATELY IDENTIFY AND STOP UNSAFE CONDITIONS REPORT CASES AND DEVELOP RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE WORKPLACE AND INDUSTRY TO PROTECT WORKERS AND THE PUBLIC. I KEEP PUT PEACE AND WORKER EMPOWERMENT WOULD YOU JUST HEARD ABOUT IS PROTECTION FROM THE THREAT OF RETALIATION. THERE IS REAL LONG TERM IMPACT OF COLLUDED NINETEEN ON WORKERS AND THEIR FAMILIES HEALTH AND SAFETY IMPACTS OF COVERT ARE BEYOND PHYSICAL THERE ARE ALSO SERIOUS MENTAL HEALTH IMPACTS THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS LONG TERM. WHAT WE NEED TO DO HERE SOME WAYS THAT YOU SEE W. BELIEVES WE PROTECT WORKERS AND- HONORED THEIR- GREAT SACRIFICE FOR BEING THOSE FRONTLINE WORKERS FOR THE LAST EIGHT MONTHS. HAZARD PAY. STRENGTHENING ANTI RETALIATION AND WITH HER WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTIONS. INCREASED EXPANDED PAID TIME OFF WORK WORKERS TO QUARANTINE OR RECOVER FROM COMMITTED BANK TEAM. THE RIGHT TO REFUSE UNSAFE WORK DUE TO COVE IN NINETEEN ARE NOT FOLLOWING THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH REGULATIONS FOR A. B. SIX EIGHTY FIVE. REQUIREMENTS WE ALSO NEED AN INCREASE IN TESTING FOR HIGH RISK INDUSTRIES AND PRIORITY TESTING FOR FACILITIES WITHOUT BRICKS. I APPRECIATE THE CHANCE FOR AN OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS YOU AND I REALLY LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING FROM OUR WORKERS WHO ARE GOING TO SPEAK NEXT THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

I'M A KFC AND CARL'S JUNIOR WORKER FROM FREMONT CALIFORNIA. I AM A LEADER IN THE FIGHT FOR FIFTEEN AND A UNION CAMPAIGN. I AM GRATEFUL AND HONORED TO ADDRESS THIS EMILY LEVER COMMITTEE TODAY ABOUT THE ISSUES FACING FAST FOOD WORKERS AND MADE THE PANDEMIC. LOW WAGES UNSAFE WORKING CONDITIONS AND A LACK OF A VOICE ON THE JOB THESE ARE THE CONDITIONS ESSENTIAL FAST FOOD WORKERS FACE DAILY AS WE CONTINUE TO RISKOUR HEALTH AND THE HEALTH OF OUR FAMILIES TO FEED OUR COMMUNITIES. OUR WORK FORCE WHICH IS MOSTLY A LOT THE NEXT BLACK AND IMMIGRANT MIRRORS THE SAME COMMUNITIES OF COLOR HAVE BEEN HIT HARDEST BY CORBIN NINETEEN. MANY OF US LIVE ON THE RAZOR'S EDGE OF ECONOMIC CALAMITY ONE MISSED SHIFT COULD MEAN A BILL UNPAID WE ARE MOMS AND DADS RAISING KIDS AND TRYING TO PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE. WE FACED A CRISIS IN OUR INDUSTRY BEFORE KALRA NINETEEN BUT THE PANDEMIC HAS ONLY EXACERBATED STRUGGLES. OUTBREAKS OF CLOVER NINETEEN HAVE SPREAD THROUGH OUR KITCHENS AND DRIVE THROUGHS AND INFILTRATED OUR HOMES AND STILL REPORT FOR DUTY BECAUSE OUR FAMILIES AND OUR COMMUNITIES COUNT ON US. WHEN WE'VE TRIED TO REPORT OUR ISSUES BIG COMPANIES LIKE MCDONALD'S HAVE TRIED TO SILENCE OUR VOICES AND THE HEALTH AGENCIES THAT WORKERS SHOULD TRUST HAVE FAILED TO INVESTIGATE OUR CLAIMS AND HOLD OUR EMPLOYERS ACCOUNTABLE. LET ME TELL YOU THE STORY OF MY COMPANY HAD A PAUSE ARE YOU LIVE FROM OAKLAND. BECAUSE LIKE ME HAS WORKED NEARLY TWENTY YEARS IN FAST FOOD. AND ALSO LIKE ME SHE HAS HAD SHE HAS TO JUGGLE AS MANY AS THREE JOBS TO MAKE ENDS MEET IN THE BAY AREA. AT THE BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMIC PAS WHO'S IN HER FIFTIES WAS TERRIFIED. SHE HEARD THAT A MCDONALD'S LOCATION DOWN THE STREET FROM HER KFC IN OAKLAND HAD AS MANY AS EIGHTEEN POSITIVE CASES OF COVE IN NINETEEN AND THAT WORKERS WERE FORCED TO WEAR DOGGIE DIAPERS AS MASS. PAUSE BEGGED HER SUPERVISORS AT KFC AND HER SECOND JOB AT JACK IN THE BOX TO PROVIDE PP MAKE SURE WORKERS ARE WASHING THEIR HANDS AND COULD SOCIAL DISTANCE. SHE WARNED COWORKERS ABOUT THE RISKS OF WORKING WHILE SICK. HER PLEAS WERE IGNORED AND SOON SEVEN WORKERS AT KFC TESTED POSITIVE THIS INCLUDES PAUSE WHO SPREAD IT TO HER SISTER IN LAW WHOM SHE SHARES A HOME WITH. PAS HAD TO BE PLACED IN A MEDICALLY INDUCED COMA TO SURVIVE THE VIRUS JUST AS SHE WAS GETTING READY TO RETURN TO WORK SHE SUFFERED A STROKE THAT HER DOCTORS BELIEVE IS A COMPLICATION OVER COVER NINETEEN DIAGNOSIS. WHEN SHE INQUIRED ABOUT PAID SICK LEAVE OF WITH HER FASTER MANAGERS ONE TOLD HER SHE HAD USED ALL OF HER TIME BUT OFFERED HER A FREE FRIED CHICKEN SANDWICH. THE OTHER SAID BEING HOSPITALIZED IN QUALIFY FOR SICK TIME. PAUSES NOW PARALYZED ON ONE SIDE OF HER BODY. SPEAKING IS DIFFICULT. AMMASH'S PLAY TO BE THE ONE THIS SEAT TODAY OVER THE WEEKEND SHE WAS RUSHED TO THE HOSPITAL WITH NEW HEALTH ISSUES. WHAT HAPPENED TO PAUSE DO NOT HAVE TO HAPPEN BUT IT ALSO KIND OF JUST EASILY HAPPEN TO ME. THE SYSTEM AS IT IS REPEATEDLY FAIL. FAST FOOD WORKERS LIKE US. PAUSES AND FOR HER AND HER CO. WHEN THEY REFER TO LET TO HER. FOR VERY. KOVITZ PRO. CAL OSHA FAILED BECAUSE IN HER COWORKER. WHEN THEY CHOSE THIS THE LETTER TO HER AND- RATHER THAN AND INSPECTORS TO HER WORK PLACES. SINCE THE BEGINNING OF A PANDEMIC FAST TO WORKERS ACROSS THE STATE HAVE FILED DOZENS OF COMPLAINTS WITH CAL OSHA. DETAILING VIOLATIONS OF HEALTH ORDERS. OPERATES IN OUR WORKPLACES AND ALLEGATIONS OF RETALIATION AGAINST WHISTLEBLOWERS. LIKE PIES NO MEANINGFUL ENFORCEMENT HAS BEEN TAKEN AND OUR ISSUES PERSIST. JUST LAST WEEK A JACK IN THE BOX WORKER FILED A COMPLAINT WITH CAL OSHA DETAILING HOW SHE WAS FIRED AFTER FOLLOWING DOCTOR'S ORDERS TO QUARANTINE. AFTER SHE'S EXPOSED TO COVE IN NINETEEN AND BECAUSE SHE WAS EXHIBITING COVE IN NINETEEN SYMPTOMS. BECAUSE A STORY DURING COVERT AND THE STORIES OF WORKERS WHO FACED OTHER HEALTH AND SAFETY ISSUES WAGE THEFT VIOLENCE SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND RACIAL DISCRIMINATION OTHER RESULT OF THREE THINGS. ONE A LACK OF CORPORATE ACCOUNTABILITY TO A LACK OF OVERSIGHT OF THE FAST FOOD INDUSTRY. AND THREE A LACK OF WORKER POWER IN THE WORKPLACE. LABOUR COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND BRINGING THESE ISSUES YOUR ATTENTION TODAY BECAUSE FAST FOOD WORKERS LIKE PIES AND MYSELF WILL REMAIN ON THE BRINK OF A CRISIS UNLESS GOVERNMENT STEPS IN AND STEPS UP FOR US NOW. I'VE BEEN PART OF THE FIGHT FOR FIFTEEN AND THE UNION SINCE THE MOVEMENT STARTED HERE IN CALIFORNIA. I REMEMBER THE JOY I FELT WHEN OUR STATE BECAME THE FIRST IN THE NATION TO PASS A FIFTEEN DOLLARS. HOUR MINIMUM WAGE. THEVICTORY WAS MEMORABLE BECAUSE WORKERS LIKE ME MADE IT POSSIBLE. AS OUR STATE FACES RISING COVER NINETEEN CASES AND RE OPENING ROLLED ROLLS BACK WORKERS CAN BE THE VALUABLE EYES AND EARS FOR STATE AGENCIES TRYING TO CRACK DOWN ON VIOLATIONS AND FIGHTING TO STOP THE SPREAD OF THE VIRUS. WORKPLACE HEALTH AND SAFETY PRECAUTIONS TO CURB THE SPREAD OF NINETEEN WILL ONLY BE EFFECTIVE OF WORKERS HELPED SHAPE THEM AND HAVE THE POWER TO ENFORCE THEM. I'VE SEEN HOW WORKERS AND LAWMAKERS CAN WORK TOGETHER TO CREATE A BETTER CALIFORNIA FOR ALL WE NEED TO WORK TOGETHER AGAIN THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR NAVARRO'S AND THANK YOU FOR SHARING- MAGISTER POWERFUL TESTIMONY BUT- THE STORY OF YOUR YOUR COWORKER AND FRIEND PAS. WHO WE REALLY WISH WELL AND- AND HER RECOVERY- BUT AS AS- YOU'VE INDICATED IT. THIS IS NOT JUST ONE EXAMPLE THERE ARE MANY EXAMPLES OF WORKERS THAT ARE. GOING THROUGH A LOT OF TRAUMA- IN BECAUSE THEY'RE- BEING INFECTED WITH CHLAMYDIA OR OTHER HEALTH AILMENTS BECAUSE THEY ARE BEING. REQUIRED TO WORK- SO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT AND FOR A FEW MINUTES BEHIND IT THAT'S BECAUSE RELYING FOR TEN TIME FOR. FULL TESTIMONY AND TRANSLATION. AND I THINK IT'S INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT THAT WE ALLOW FOR THAT WOULD ALLOW FOR. THE WORKERS TESTIFYING TO TESTIFY IN THE LANGUAGE OF THEIR MOST COMFORTABLE IN. A THESE ARE ESSENTIAL WORKERS AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT. THAT BUT EVERYONE RECOGNIZES WHO IS DOING THE WORK THAT ALLOWS US TO BE ABLE TO STAY AT HOME AND CARE FOR FAMILIES. DURING THIS PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS AND WHO'S BEING REQUIRED TO GO TO WORK AT THEIR OWN. A GREAT RISK OF THEM AND THEIR FAMILIES SO- PLEASE- SHAPE THE TIME- THE I APPRECIATE EVERYONE- I WITNESSES WITH BE OPPORTUNE TO SPEAK GET THE PROPER TRY. ARE EVERYONE UNDERSTAND. THE PLIGHT OF OUR WORKERS WHAT THEY'RE GOING THROUGH- WE STILL HAVE MORE WORKERS TO HEAR FROM- I DON'T BELIEVE ANY. OF THE FINAL THREE SPEAKERS OF REQUIRED TRANSITION IF THEY DO WILL ABSOLUTELY LOVE TIME FOR THAT- NEXT IS. GOING IS KEEPING IN THE FOOD SECTOR AROUND. ABOUT ONE THAT WE HAVEN'T ALWAYS HEARD FROM IN THAT IN THAT VEIN AND THAT'S CAFETERIA WORKERS IN SCHOOLS- AND SO WE'RE GOING TO BE HEARING FROM DEBORAH ORTIZ WHO'S A SCHOOL NUTRITION. DRIVER WHO WILL BE ACCOMPANIED BY A GIANT SUPERSTAR OF THE CSEA. AND I BELIEVE SHE'S IN. THE VIDEO ROOM A ROOM HERE IN SACRAMENTO. SENATE MAJORITY IS WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN MY NAME IS DEBORAH TEAS AND I WAS GONNA CHRISTIAN DRIVER AT THE RUSSELL CITY ELEMENTARY SCHOOL DISTRICT AND RESULT. WHICH IS LOCATED TWENTY FIVE MINUTES EAST OF THE STATE CAPITOL. I'M ALSO THE PRESIDENT OF OUR LOCAL CSEA CALIFORNIA SCHOOL EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION CHAPTER. AND AS YOU KNOW CSU REPRESENTS TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND CLASSIFIED SCHOOL EMPLOYEES AND OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES ACROSS THE STATE. I'VE BEEN WORKING AT THE REST WILL CITY ELEMENTARY SCHOOL DISTRICT FOR TWELVE YEARS AND I'VE BEEN IN NUTRITION SERVICES THE ENTIRE TIME. I'M ALSO THE PRESIDENT OF OUR LOCAL CHAPTER OF THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL. NUTRITION ASSOCIATION I'VE WORKED IN MANY DIFFERENT FOOD SERVICE POSITIONS INCLUDING CASHIER COOK SUPPLY KICKER PROCUREMENT DELIVERY FROM THE CENTRAL KITCHEN AND WAREHOUSE. I'M CURRENTLY WORKING AT THE CENTRAL WAREHOUSE DELIVERING FOOD. I GO TO TEN SITES EACH DAY. I AM VERY PROUD OF MY WORK HELPING TO ENSURE THAT NO CHILD GOES HUNGRY SO THEY CAN FOCUS ON THEIR ACADEMIC STUDIES AND BE READY TO LEARN. THANK YOU FOR GIVING US THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE OUR STORIES IN TERMS OF WORKPLACE SAFETY AND CHALLENGES DURING THE PANDEMIC. I WILL BE SHARING MY PERSONAL STORY OF ROSEVILLE AS WELL AS SHARING SOME KEY FINDINGS FROM ACROSS THE STATE FROM OTHER DISTRICTS. STATEWIDE THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION REPORTS THAT WE SERVE SIX MILLION MEALS AT OVER THIRTY FOUR THOUSAND LOCATIONS EVERYDAY. AND ROOSEVELT WE HAVE TOTAL ENROLLMENT OF ELEVEN THOUSAND STUDENTS. TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED KIDS IN OUR DISTANCE LEARNING PROGRAM AND ANOTHER EIGHTY FOUR HUNDRED AND ARE MODIFIED TRADITIONAL. WE'RE SUPPOSED TO HAVE NINETY TWO FOR SERVICE WORKERS TASKED WITH PROVIDING TO MAIL TODAY TO ALL THE KIDS ONE OF THE FIRST PROBLEMS WE FACE. MEETING THAT GOAL IS A SHORTAGE OF STAFF. CURRENTLY WE HAVE FOURTEEN POSITIONS VACANT AND ARE BEING POSTED MANY OF THEM WERE PREVIOUSLY POSTED AND NOBODY APPLIED SO NOW THEY'RE BEING REPOSTED. THEY HAVE A STARTING WAGE OF FOURTEEN TO FIFTEEN DOLLARS AN HOUR AND MOST OF THESE POSITIONS ARE LESS THAN THREE HOURS A DAY SO THEY'RE VERY HARD TO FILL. UNTIL THESE POSITIONS ARE FILLED WERE OPERATING WITH YOUR STAFF THIS MEANS THAT EACH OF US HAS TO PICK UP THE WORKLOAD AND FILL THAT GAP TO MAKE SURE THAT THE MAILS ARE DELIVERED ON TIME. OTHER FOOD SERVICE POSITIONS ARE PROTECTED FROM LAYOFFS AND THE STATE YOU'RE A BUDGET. ACROSS THE STATE THERE ARE NEARLY FIVE THOUSAND LAYOFFS OF OTHER TYPES OF SUPPORT STAFF IN OUR SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES. AS WE STRUGGLE TO REOPEN OUR SCHOOLS WE NEED MORE STAFF NOT FEWER TO SAFELY PREPARE AND DELIVER MEALS FOR STUDENTS. THE NEXT IMPORTANT ISSUE THAT I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT IS THE NEED FOR WORKPLACE PROTOCOLS TO PREVENT THE SPREAD OF THE VIRUS. LOTS OF EMPLOYEES HAVE PUT THEIR HEALTH AND WELL BEING AT RISK TO ENSURE CHILDREN. AND COMMUNITIES RECEIVE MUCH NEEDED FAILED DURING THIS CRISIS. THE EMPLOYEES ARE VERY WELL OF THE POTENTIAL OF CATCHING COVERED NINETEEN WILL WORKING ONSITE. AND INTERACTING WITH COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND YET. THEY DO SO WITH THAT KNOWLEDGE BECAUSE IF IT WERE NOT FOR THESE MAILS THESE KIDS COULD GO HUNGRY. I'VE BEEN TOLD THAT OUR DISTRICT HAS BEEN SELECTED AS ONE OF EIGHTEEN IN THE STATE. TO PARTICIPATE IN A PILOT PROGRAM FOR SURVEILLANCE TESTING AND TRACING FOR STAFF. I HOPE THAT WE GET A GOOD PROTOCOL FOR THIS TESTING PROCESS SO THAT WE CAN PREVENT THE SPREAD OF THE VIRUS. AT OUR WORKPLACE AND THAT ALL OF OUR WORK SITES. AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT EMPLOYEES ARE GIVEN GOOD NOTICES AND TRAINING FOR THAT TESTING PROCESS. THIRD WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT FOOD SERVICE WORKERS HAVE ENOUGH PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT TO PROTECT THEMSELVES. TYPICALLY PEOPLE THINK OF GLOVES AND MASKS WHEN THEY THINK OF PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT. SOMETIMES THE WORK ENVIRONMENT AND CONDITIONS REQUIRE SPECIALIZED PORTABLE EQUIPMENT. FOR EXAMPLE SINCE THERE'S NO DINING IN THE CAFETERIA AT THIS TIME. WE HAVE TO LOAD THE MEALS ON TO CARTS TO HELP TO GET THEM TO CLASSROOMS WHERE THE STUDENTS ARE NOW EATING. THEIR BREAKFAST AND LUNCH. WE TEND TO FORGET ABOUT SIMPLE THINGS LIKE HAVING OF CARDS. SO THAT WE CAN TRANSPORT THE FOOD. AND THERE ARE OTHER OF. IN SOME CASES WE SHOULD HAVE A PORTABLE BARRIER DEVICE LIKE PORTABLE PLEXIGLASS ESPECIALLY WHEN WE'RE HANDING OUT MEALS AT AN OFF CAMPUS LOCATION. AT LITTLE LAKE UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT OUR MEMBERS ARE HAVING TO SERVE MEALS ENTIRELY OUTSIDE DEALING WITH THE WEATHER IS AN ADDED STRESS IN SERVING MEALS DURING THE SUMMER WHEN IT'S A HUNDRED AND FIVE DEGREES OUT TRYING TO KEEP NO COLD OUTDOORS WITH NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE. AND WHEN IT'S RAINING THERE ARE NONE OF CANOPIES TO COVER EVERYTHING AND WHEN IT'S WINDY THE CANNABIS CABELO WAY. IN SOME PLACES EMPLOYEES MUST SANITIZE THE EQUIPMENT ALONG WITH THEIR CLOTHES. BEFORE AND AFTER CONTACT WITH CHILDREN AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS. THESE ARE SOME OF THE KEY ISSUES THAT WE'RE FACING IN CONCLUSION THE KEY POINTS I WANT TO LEAVE YOU WITH OUR ONE WE NEED MORE STAFF NOT LAST. STATEWIDE CSEA IS FACING FIVE THOUSAND CLASSIFIED SCHOOL EMPLOYEES WHO HAVE BEEN LAID OFF MANY OF THEM ARE TEACHERS AIDES IN THE CLASSROOMS WE NEED MORE PEOPLE NOT LESS TO SAFELY AND EFFECTIVELY DO OUR WORK AND PROTECT KIDS AND ENSURE THAT THEY DON'T GO HUNGRY. TO TRAINING ON SAFETY PROTOCOLS EMPLOYERS SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED TO PLAN AND TRAIN ON SAFETY PROTOCOLS FOR THEIR EMPLOYEES THEY SHOULD ALSO HAVE FREQUENT SURVEILLANCE TESTING ESPECIALLY WHERE THERE IS AN OUTBREAK TO PREVENT THE SPREAD OF THE INFECTION. THREE SUFFICIENT PBS SUPPLY WE NEED TO ENSURE ALL WORKERS HAVE ACCESS TO ADEQUATE PP WE WANT TO THANK THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE FOR THEIR EFFORT TO PROVIDE EMPLOYEES WITH PP EARLY IN THE PANDEMIC. WE MUST CONTINUE TO RECEIVE APPROPRIATE PP INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO MATH CLASS FACIAL PLASTIC ESSENTIAL SUPPLIES. FINALLY A GOOD EMPLOYERS AND SOME DISTRICTS HAVE PROVIDED ADDITIONAL PAY OR STIPENDS TO MEMBERS AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF THE INCREASED WORKLOAD TO HAZARDOUS CONDITIONS IN WHICH WE ARE WORKING AND OUR DEDICATION TO FEED OUR STUDENTS AND COMMUNITIES DURING TH PANDEMIC. THAT IS MUCH APPRECIATED WE HOPE THAT THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR CAN CONTINUE PROVIDING THE NEEDED RESOURCES TO SUPPORT OUR FOOD SERVICE WORKERS AND ALL CLASSIFIED STAFF WHO ARE KEEPING OUR SCHOOLS OPERATING SAFELY THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE OUR STORIES AND EXPERIENCE. THANK YOU SO MUCH MINORITIES AND THANK YOU INTO THE MEMBERS. OF THE SCHOOL. HELLO TWITTERVERSE WERE AROUND STATE THAT KEPT OUR STATE FED. OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS IN AND TO YOUR POINT IT WITH MY MANY CHALLENGES THAT THEY'RE FACING TO DO IT- UP NEXT WE HAVE. THIS SPEAK TO OUR WAREHOUSE WORKERS SHARE OUR POLLUTION EXACTED DIRECTOR THE WAREHOUSE WORKER CENTER I ALSO WANT TO THANK ME MISTER POSTING FOR ALSO ATTENDING AND PARTICIPATING IN OUR INFO HEARING WE HAD- IN RIVERSIDE AS WELL. AS A THANK YOU- MISCONSTRUED. FROM THANK YOU CHAIRMAN KALRA AND SO WE MEMBERS MY NAME SHARE COST YOU KNOW I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE WAREHOUSE WORK RESOURCE CENTER IN ONTARIO ORGANIZATIONS DEDICATED TO IMPROVING THE LIVES OF WAREHOUSE WORKERS AND THEIR FAMILIES IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THROUGH EDUCATION ADVOCACY IN ACTION FOR OVER TEN YEARS WE HAVE ASSISTED WORKERS IN THE GOODS MOVING SECTOR AND RIVERSIDE SAMBAR DINO L. A. COUNTY IS. TO FIGHT FOR SAFE WORKPLACES SECURE EMPLOYMENT AND LIVING WAGES TOBIT NINETEEN IT'S A MASSIVE HAD A MASSIVE EFFECT ON OUR WORK FORCES IN OUR REGION COVETOUS EXACERBATED EXPANDED THE EXISTING INEQUITIES PRESSURES AND PROBLEMS THAT WORKERS FACE IN WAREHOUSES AND IN GENERAL IN THE FIRST FEW WEEKS OF THE OUTBREAK WE HEARD FROM WORKERS WAREHOUSES FOOD PROCESSING SERVICE INDUSTRIES AND OTHER SECTORS ACROSS THE INLAND EMPIRE THESE WORKERS GENERALLY HAD CONCERNS ABOUT CONFIRMED A RUMOR AND COVERT INFECTIONS IN THE WORKPLACES MOST WOMEN NOT RECEIVED ANY GUIDANCE FROM THEIR EMPLOYERS OR ANYBODY ELSE ABOUT THE BEST PRACTICES FOR STAYING SAFE AT WORK. IN THOSE EARLY WEEKS MANY WORKERS WE SPOKE TO A COOK HAD CONTACTED CAL OSHA HAD NOT RECEIVED ANY GUIDANCE OR GAUGE BUT FROM THE AGENCY ON THE ISSUES OF THE WORKPLACE THE CONTINUED. THIS CONTINUED AS WE ENGAGED GROUPS OF WORKERS ACROSS AMAZON FACILITIES IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. SPECIFICALLY ONE GROUP IS FILLED RIVERSIDE COUNTY. ANOTHER IN HAWTHORNE YEARS LAX AIRPORT. THIS FACILITY IS VERY SIGNIFICANT OUTBREAKS OF COLD IN NINETEEN IN APRIL AND MAY- UP TO FIFTY OR SIXTY OR EVEN MORE WORKERS CONFIRMED INFECTED PUFF POSSIBLY MANY MORE- AT THE TIME THESE WORKERS COMPLAIN THAT THEY ARE NOT RECEIVING PROPER EDUCATION ABOUT THE TRANSMISSION. OF COVERT AMAZON REFUSING TO PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT THE- SPACE THE AREAS WHERE THE CASES WERE OCCURRING AND WHAT WORKERS MIGHT BE POTENTIALLY AFFECTED. WORKERS WERE MOVING IN THESE WAREHOUSES VERY QUICKLY IN ORDER TO KEEP UP THE MASSIVE NUMBER OF ORDERS FLOWING AT THAT PERIOD. AND OFTEN DID NOT HAVE TIME TO CLEAN THEIR WORKSTATIONS WASH OUR HANDS MORE FREQUENTLY WHILE KEEPING UP WITH THE DEMAND. THIS RUSSIAN AT THE WORKSTATIONS EQUIPMENT OFFICE OFTEN DIDN'T GET CLEANED. SOCIAL DISTANCING BROKE DOWN. WHICH TOOK DOWN NOTES AND WORKERS OF BOTH SIDES FILE COMPLAINTS WITH CAL OSHA- TODAY WE HOPE TO HAVE A WORKER BE ABLE TO COME AND SPEAK BUT THE ON THE WORKERS WE WERE TALKING TO WERE AFRAID. OF TAKING A DAY OFF DURING THIS HOLIDAY RUSH. IT'S NO REPLACEMENT BUT I HAVE A FEW QUOTES FROM WORKERS AT THE TIME. ONE WORKER AT THE TIME SAID IT WAS OPTIONAL TO CLEAN YOUR WORKSTATION IT WASN'T REQUIRED. NOBODY ELSE CLEAN THEM. ANOTHER QUOTE FROM WORKER A WORKER SAID I THOUGHT AMAZON DIDN'T TAKE OVER SERIOUSLY AT THE BEGINNING AND THE PROBABLY CAUSE A SPIKE IN THE HEART A LOT OF NEW PEOPLE COULD HAVE BROUGHT IT IN THEY SEEM MUCH MORE CONCERNED ABOUT THE OR NEW ORDERS IN GETTING THEM OUT THEN EVERYBODY'S SAFETY INSTEAD OF CUTTING BACK ON RATE THE EXPECTED MORE BECAUSE THERE ARE MORE ORDERS. AND A FINAL QUOTE WE HAVE TO REDUCE GLOVES AND MASKS THEY SAID STAY SIX FEET APART BUT THEY DON'T REALLY TAKE ACTION TO HOLD PEOPLE TO THE RULES. IT'S FOR PUBLICITY. CALLOSUM WAS RESPONSIVE TO THE COMPLAINTS OF THESE WORKERS. INSPECTED BOTH SIDES. AND CITED ARE BOTH SIDES- ON OCTOBER NINTH. DISSERTATIONS ARE FOCUSED ON THE LACK OF TRAINING FOR WORKERS. AT THIS POINT. WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THESE WAREHOUSES AND OTHER WAREHOUSES ARE NOT ACTUALLY FIXING THE PROBLEMS. BUT RATHER SPEEDING WORKERS UP IN ORDER TO MANAGE THE COMING HOLIDAY RUSH. WORKERS WE HAVE TALKED TO. HAVE SEEN VERY FEW CHANGES IN THE SAFETY PROCEDURES THERE WERE HOUSES THAT ARE RECEIVED CITATIONS. OR IN ANY OTHER SITES IN OUR REGION. WE'RE CONCERNED AMAZON OTHER MAJOR EMPLOYERS. SEE THE SMALL CITATIONS IN THE STRETCH CAPACITY A CALLOW SURE. AND DECIDED THAT THEY HAVE NO REASON TO COMPLY. OR WORK TO PROTECT THEIR WORKERS. WE'RE CONCERNED THAT WORKERS IN MOST WAREHOUSES AND OTHER FACILITIES. ARE FACING DIFFICULTY STAYING PROTECTED. WORKERS ARE CONCERNED BECAUSE THEY'RE BEING TOLD THEY HAVE TO STAY CLOSE WORKING CALL CLOSE PROXIMITY. BASED ON THE SET UP THEIR WAREHOUSES. WORKPLACES WITH CONVEYORS ESPECIALLY MIGHT HAVE A SHOOT WITH SIX WORKERS ON EACH SIDE PICKING. SIX BOXES PER MINUTE OFF THE OFF THE BELT. SCHERING SCANNERS IN PLASTIC WRAP. WORKERS REPORT TO CERTAIN DEPARTMENTS. THERE THERE ARE CERTAIN DEPARTMENTS WERE DISTANCE CANNOT DANCE IS DISTANCING COULD NOT BE MAINTAINED. AND THESE ARE THE SITES ABOUT BRICKS WERE ONLY THE MOST DESPERATE WORKERS STAY ON. FINALLY WERE CONCERNED ABOUT THE ENFORCEMENT OF LEAVE-POLICIES. WE SEE THE AMAZON OF FIRST REFUSED TO COMPLY WITH THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER WHICH GRANTED FOOD SECTOR WORKERS TWO WEEKS PAID CODE COVERED LEAVE. IF THEY HAD A HOUSEHOLD MEMBER WHO IS INFECTED OR IF THEY'RE INFECTED. NOW WORKERS ARE CONFUSED ABOUT WHAT KIND OF LEAVE AND HOW MUCH THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO. WORKERS ARE GIVEN THE RUN AROUND BY THEIR- BY THEIR EMPLOYERS BY HR. ABOUT WHEN THEY WANT TO TAKE LEAVE AND THAT KIND OF DELAY DELAY ALSO LEADS TO THE- EXISTING SPREAD OF CALL OF IT. THIS IS ONCE AGAIN EMPLOYERS PUSHING UNHEALTHY PRACTICES FOR THE BENEFITS OF THEIR SHORT SHORT TERM PRODUCTIVITY. AND PROFIT. MAJOR ECONOMIC COMMERCE COMPANIES LIKE AMAZON HAVE MADE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN THIS PANDEMIC. THIS COMES DIRECTLY FROM THE VALUE CREATED BY THESE WORKERS. AND FOR THE SACRIFICES MADE BY WAREHOUSE WORKERS. AND THEIR DRIVER'S. SB SIX THIRTY FIVE REPRESENTS A REALLY GOOD STEP INFORMS US IN IN TERMS OF DISCLOSURE FOR WORKERS- THE PROPOSED CARLOS EMERGENCY STANDARD ALSO REPRESENTS A REALLY GOOD SET OF STANDARDS. WILL MAKE IT MUCH CLEAR WHERE EMPLOYERS WHAT EMPLOYERS MUST PROVIDE AND WE'RE WORKERS STAND. WE HAVE SOME ADDITIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS. THE MOST IMPORTANT THING RIGHT NOW IS ENFORCEMENT. WE'RE WORKING TO SUPPORT WORKERS ACROSS THE REGION FACE THESE RISKS EVERY DAY. I WILL CONTINUE TO EDUCATE THEM ON THE STANDARDS AND POLICIES AND WHAT THEIR RIGHTS ARE. WE BELIEVE THAT THE STATE NEEDS TO INVEST IN PERSON INSPECTIONS OF MAJOR SITES. ESPECIALLY SITES WITH CONFIRMED OUTBREAKS. WE BELIEVE THE STATE AND COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS MUST ENGAGE PUBLIC. OF WORKPLACE OUTBREAKS AND PARTNER CLOSELY WITH CAL OSHA TO ENSURE THAT ENFORCEMENT COORDINATED AND STRATEGIC. WE BELIEVE THE STRONGER ENFORCEMENT AGAINST WORKPLACE RETALIATION SORELY NEEDED TO ENABLE WORKERS TO STAND UP. AGAINST A REPORT UNSAFE CONDITIONS. WE BELIEVE WORKERS IN A BROADER STATE SET OF SAFETY NETS. AND SUPPORT TO FEEL CONFIDENT RISKING SPEAKING UP. INCLUDING C. EXPANDED PAID SICK LEAVE MORE FUNCTIONAL UNEMPLOYMENT APPLICATION PROCESS AND BROADER JOBLESS BENEFITS FOR UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS. ALL THESE THINGS WILL SET THE STATE UP TO FULLY ADDRESS THE SPEND DEMOCRATS. IN THE WAREHOUSE INDUSTRY IS AN ADEQUATE RESPONSE TO IT THANK YOU. THANK THANK YOU SO MUCH YOU'RE A MISTER BECAUSE YOU FOR REPRESENTING THE VOICE OF THE WORK WAREHOUSE WORKERS AS YOU MENTIONED- THEY CAN'T GET TIME OFF TO. TO SPEAK TO US BUT I'M GLAD TO HEAR THERE. TO REPRESENT THEIR VOICE APPRECIATED- AND THEN THE FINAL OF A WORK REPRESENTATIVE IN THE HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY. IS ZACK ANDERSON WAS A WORKER- WHO'S GONNA BE CHIMING IN FROM LOS ANGELES. AND ZACH YOU HAVE UP TO FIVE MINUTES AS WELL. YEP WE'RE GOOD TO GO WHENEVER YOU ARE. GREAT THANK YOU- MY NAME IS ZACH ANDERSON AND TODAY ON THIS PANEL I WILL BE SHOWING THE REALITY OF THE SIDE OF THE WORKING CLASS THAT HAS BEEN- DISREGARDED. AND CASTASIDE AS A RESULT OF THE CURRENT PANDEMIC WE'RE FOR CURRENTLY FACED WITH. AND IF YOU ALLOW ME pI WILL PAINT A PICTURE OF WHERE. MANY BLUE CAL COLORED- CALIFORNIANS FIND HIMSELF AS OF RIGHT NOW. I WORK AT A RESORT IN SOUTH LOS ANGELES BY THE NAME OF TURNING A RESORT. IF YOU'RE UNFAMILIAR WITH MY PROPERTY. IS LOCATED IN RANCHO PALOS VERDES BORDERING PALACE VERDES ESTATES ROLLING HILLS. AND ST PETER WORK CURRENTLY RESIDE. AT THIS PROJECT BOB PROPERTY I'VE WORKED UNDER MANY POSITIONS DURING MY YEARS AT THIS LOCATION. MOST RECENTLY HOWEVER I WAS A BANQUET CIRCUMVENT SERVER HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF BEING ABLE TO WORK EVENTS OF ALL SHAPES AND SIZES AS PART OF THE FOOD AND BEVERAGE INDUSTRY. I WORKED AT THIS PROPERTY FOR ABOUT SHY OF TEN YEARS UNTIL THE RUG WAS PULLED OUT FROM UNDERNEATH ME. THE LAST DAY I WORKED AT MY PROPERTY WAS FEBRUARY SIXTEENTH OF THIS PAST YEAR. WHAT WAS FORCED TO- WHAT WAS FORECASTED TO BE A BRIEF INTERMISSION FROM OUR NORMAL BUSINESS SCHEDULE TURNED INTO AN ANXIETY FUELED NIGHTMARE. IN THE COLLAPSE OF OUR CURRENT DAY TO DAY LIVES AS WE KNOW IT. FOR WORKERS LIKE ME IN THE HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY. FOOD HEALTH AND SAFETY IS THE FOREFRONT OF OUR MINDS AND WE WANT TO BE SAFE WE WANT TO WEAR MASKS WE WANNA USE PROPER SANITATION PRACTICES. WHATEVER IT TAKES TO GET. HEALTH AND SAFETY PUT ACROSS THE BOARD. AS SOMEONE WITH YEARS OF EXPERIENCE IN THE INDUSTRY I WILL NEVER FORGET THAT THIS IS MY LIFE AND THE LIFE OF OUR GUESTS WHICH ARE ON THE LINE. EXPERIENCE WORKERS ARE MORE LIKELY.TO HAVE THE KNOWLEDGE TO UNDERSTAND AND SPEAK OUT ABOUT SAFETY PRACTICES AT WORK. BUT WITHOUT JOB SECURITY IS VERY HARD FOR ANYONE TO SPEAK OUT. THE PANDEMIC HAS LEFT THOUSANDS OF HOSPITALITY WORKERS LIKE ME UNEMPLOYED. AND THOSE WHO DO REMAIN UNEMPLOYED THEIR POSITION IS MUCH MORE PRECARIOUS- PERSONAL PERSONAL EXPERIENCE MINE IS- HI I CURRENTLY WAS- IN A SITUATION A COUPLE YEARS AGO. WHERE I HAD BEEN WORKING A LARGE AMOUNT. AND IT WAS RANGING IN THE HUNDREDS. AT THIS EVENT IN PARTICULAR I WAS- ELECTROCUTED IN HOURS I FELL TO MY KNEES IN FRONT OF- MANY PEOPLE INCLUDING MY- STAFF AND CO WORKERS. I HAD REMOVED MY- VINYL GLOVES AFTER I'D BEEN WORKING A CARVING STATION. AND PLACED MY HAND ON ONE OF OUR HEAT LAMPS WHICH WE USED TO KEEP OUR MEET WARM TO SERVE. WHEN THE- METAL LAMP CONDUCTED WITH MY MOIST FRESH AND OUT OF THE VINYL GLOVES. I CAN ESTIMATE THAT I WAS OUT FOR A LEAST TEN SECONDS BEFORE I WAS ABLE TO LET GO AND MY COWORKER CAME TO MY ASSISTANCE. MOMENTS AFTER TEAM MET IN THE BACK SERVICE HALLWAY. WE WERE REVIWING THE NIGHT SERVICE AND IF ANYTHING NEEDED TO BE IMPROVED FOR OUR GUESTS EXPERIENCE. I RAISE MY HAND IN FRONT OF ABOUT THIRTY OR MORE OR LESS WORKERS THAT WE HAVE THAT EVENING STATING THAT IT WAS NOT A KID GAS CONCERN. HAVE BEEN ABOUT- BAD ELECTROCUTION BY THE HEAT OF THE LAMP STATING THAT IT WAS NOT- I'M SO SORRY- AND TO BE CAREFUL BECAUSE I HAD ELECTROCUTED MYSELF ON THE LAMP- IN SHORT BASICALLY WHAT ENDED UP HAPPENING WAS MY SUPERVISOR TOLD ME WHILE IT WASN'T A GAS CONCERN- WE WERE FOCUSING ON WHAT THE- GUESTS WERE GOING THROUGH AND RATHER DISMISSING WHAT I HAD BROUGHT TO THE TABLE IN FRONT OF ALL MY CO WORKERS IN WAS HUMILIATED. AND THEY'LL ALL TESTIFY MY BEHALF TO THE STATE THAT I THAT WAS PUT DOWN. AND THEY DIDN'T FILE A SECURITY REPORT. NOTHING SO. BUT ESPECIALLY DURING THIS PANDEMIC WE KNOW THAT EMPLOYEES HEALTH AND SAFETY IS A GUEST CONCERNED AND VICE VERSA- WE CARE ABOUT THE PEOPLE THAT WE- TAKE CARE OF IN FEED- THIS INCIDENT SPURRED ME SPEAK OUT ABOUT THE CONDITIONS AT WORK BUT IS NOT BEEN EASY. IF THERE IS A TIME TO ENSURE THE PORT THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING EXPERIENCED AND DEDICATED EMPLOYEES. NO MATTER WHAT PROFESSION I WOULD SAY THAT THAT TIME IS CLEARLY NOW. INSTEAD EMPLOYEE EMPLOYERS LIKE MINE HAVE LAID OFF SO MANY EXPERIENCED STAFF. WITH NO GUARANTEE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO RETURN TO WORK ON THE PANDEMIC IS OVER. THERE'S NO GUARANTEE FOR WHAT TOMORROW HOLDS THERE IS NO CERTAINTY FOR THE FUTURE AND RIGHT NOW IT IS GRAHAM AND THERE'S NO HOPE. THAT IS WHY HOSPITALITY WORKERS LIKE MYSELF FOUGHT FOR MEASURE AB. THIRTY TWO SIXTEEN WHICH WOULD HAVE ENABLED US TO AT LEAST KNOW THAT OUR JOBS WILL BE SECURE AND WE WILL BE ABLE TO RETURN TO WORK WHEN THE PANDEMIC IS OVER. I STILL HAVE HOPE THOUGH. IF EXPERIENCE WORKERS LIKE ME CAN GO GO CAN GO BACK TO WORK WE CAN BUILD. AND HAVE A BETTER AND SAFER ENVIRONMENT THAN PREVIOUSLY. PERHAPS THIS HORRIBLE CRISIS IS WHAT IT WAS REQUIRED TO MAKE PEOPLE BECOME MORE CONSCIENTIOUS OF ONE ANOTHER. IF WE IMPLEMENT THE CHANGES NECESSARY TO ADDRESS. M- PROTECT ALL OF OUR HEALTH IMAGINE THE POSITIVE INFLUENCE IT WOULD HAVE- I WOULD I WOULD HOPE THAT WE WOULD BE SO BOLD TO ADDRESS THAT THE TRANSMISSION OF OTHER ILLNESSES IN THE WORKPLACE RANGING FROM COMMON COLD TO THE FLU. COULD BE GREATLY REDUCED- WE IMPACT COULD DRASTICALLY DECREASE THE TRANSMISSION OF THESE ILLNESSES. AS A RESULT OF BETTER HEALTH AND SAFETY PRACTICES. I ONLY SEE A BRIGHTER FUTURE ON THE HORIZON. IF WE INSURE THAT EXPERIENCE WORKERS CAN GET BACK TO WORK AND THAT ALL WORKERS HAVE THE SENSE THAT THEY CAN SPECIFICALLY SPEAK OUT ABOUT CONDITIONS IN THE WORKPLACE WITHOUT FEAR OF LOSING THEIR JOBS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME REALLY APPRECIATE IT. THANKS MISTER ANDERSON FOR SHARING YOUR STORY AND FOR ENDING WITH OF SOME OPTIMISM THAT THAT I SHARE WITH YOU AND HOPE THAT THIS CRISIS. HELPS US SEE I SEE EACH OTHER'S COMMON HUMANITY AND THAT THE HEALTH OF ONE. AFFECTS THE HEALTH OF OTHERS. SO I'M GOING TO FIRST SEE IF ANY MEMBERS. HAVE QUESTIONS AND IF MEMBERS HAVE COMMENTS. SINCE WE DO WANT TO GET THE PUBLIC COMMENT WHEN I'M GOING TO ASK IS THAT A MEMBERS OF QUESTIONS ASK QUESTIONS NOW. WILL GO TO PUBLIC COMMENT. ANY COMMENTS THAT OUR MEMBERS HAVE.

AND FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVE LOST YOUR JOBS- FOLLOWING A LOT IS AND HE GAVE HIS TESTIMONY ABOUT HIS- CO WORKER BOSS. IT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT THAT YOU SEEK OUT LEGAL ADVICE IF YOUR RIGHTS ARE NOT BEING PROTECTED AND YOU DO NEED TO.

OF CODE IN THE WORKPLACE AND- REALLY DO WHAT I'VE HEARD- THEM TALK ABOUT IS. WEAK WE CAN'T SAY SOMEBODY'S AN ESSENTIAL WORKER AND THEN NOT TREAT THEM LIKE THEY'RE ESSENTIAL AND THAT'S WHAT WE'VE DONE. NOW AT.

WAS RUN RUN SMOOTHLY. I MEMBER DOES ALL SAID THAT. THIS IS A HERE THAT REALLY- WAS CENTERED ON WORKERS AND WORKERS STORIES AND I AND I KNOW THAT. THERE'S SOME EMPLOYERS ONLY HAS A VERY VERY GOOD QUALITY RESPONSIBLE EMPLOYERS THAT HAVE BEEN DOING THE RIGHT THINGS I KNOW THAT.

THERE'S SAID BEFORE- YOU KNOW WE CALL THESE COURAGEOUS WORKERS WE DEEM. ASIDE BUT ALL TO OUR WE TREAT AS IF THEY SEPARATE.
