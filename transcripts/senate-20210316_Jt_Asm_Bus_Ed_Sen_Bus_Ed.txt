BUT ALSO TO ENSURE THAT THE MECHANICS OF GOVERNMENT ARE FUNCTIONING IN A WAY THAT BREAST SERVES OUR STATE. INCLUDING THE REGULATION OF VERY BUSINESS ACTIVITIES AND PROFESSIONS. THE BUREAU OF PRIVATE POST SECONDARY EDUCATION HAS THE CHALLENGING ROLE OF EXISTING IN THE REGULATORY SPACE BETWEEN LICENSURE AND EDUCATIONALISTS AS HE- IS THIS AN AGENCY THAT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR AUTHORIZING A BUSINESS TO RUN WITHIN THE CONFINES OF THE LAW.

WHILE ALSO STANDING UP. OZAR AND RESPONDING TO SEVERAL HIGH PROFILE SCHOOL CLOSURES THE BUREAU SUBMITTED A SUNSET REPORT WITH RECOMMENDATIONS AS TO HOW THE BP CAN TAKE EARLIER AND MORE MEANINGFUL ACTION TO PROTECT STUDENTS AND THE STATE. I APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT THE BPP HAS DONE AND WHILE THE LEGISLATURE HAS OFTEN HAD CAUSE FOR CONCERN I WANT TO BEGIN TODAY BY RECOGNIZING THE EFFORTS OF ALL THEBUREAU STAFF WHO WORK TOWARDS IMPROVING THE BPP.

I THANK YOU FOR THAT OPPORTUNITY YOUR PART AND NOT A YOUR STAFF AS ALL WORK TO PUT AND PRO STUDENTS AND WHAT THAT WE- WELCOME QUITE THAT THE COMMITTEE HAS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR NOW GO IN. A QUEST FROM MEMBER AND FOR WILL BE WITH S. M. MEMBER. THANKS VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR LET ME FOR START BY THANKING HIM FOR COMMITTEE- THAT HAD GATHERED TODAY I THINK THIS IS REFLECTIVE. OF HOW MUCH INTEREST THERE IS. IN THIS AGENCY AND I WILL TO SPEAK FOR MYSELF BUT I THINK THAT MANY OF OUR COLLEAGUES HAVE HAD THE PERSPECTIVE THAT THE BUREAU OF PRIVATE POST SECONDARY EDUCATION. IS IN DIRE NEED OF REFORM AT A TIME WHEN OUR STUDENTS ARE SUFFERING IMMENSELY. COMPLICATED START WITH THE TWO PARTS OF THE NOTES FIRST- I WANT A CREDIT BUREAU FOR ACTUALLY DENTAL FINE. OBSTACLES TO FULFILLING ITS MISSION AND PROVIDING RECOMMENDATIONS TO US AND I WANT TO JUST HIGHLIGHT BRIEFLY A FEW. FROM RECOMMENDING THAT WE CHANGE THE HARM REQUIREMENT TO ENABLE THE BUREAU TO PREVENT HARM TO STUDENTS PROACTIVELY. REQUIRING SCHOOLS TO OBTAIN SURETY BONDS TO COVER COSTS IN THE EVENT OF CLOSURES. RECOMMENDED THE AUTHORIZATION OF THE BUREAU TO CREATE STRONGER MINIMUM OPERATING STANDARDS AND ALSO. POSING THAT THE BUREAU GET MORE DISCRETION REGARDING APPROVAL OF ACCREDITATION I THINK THESE ARE ALL REFORMS THAT WE SHOULD ADOPT IN A VERY MUCH HOPE. IN THIS PROCESS THAT WE WILL. SECONDLY I KNOW THAT OUR DCA DIRECTOR MENTIONED THIS BUT- I WANT TO JUST- APPRECIATE GOVERNOR NEWSOM FOR APPOINTING DEBBIE COCHRAN TO. THE ROLE OF DIRECTOR WE HAVE NOT HAD A DIRECTOR. IN THIS DEPARTMENT FOR A NUMBER OF MONTHS SHE HAS BEEN A STRONG INDEPENDENT EXPERIENCED AND WELL REGARDED. VOICE FOR HIGHER ED STUDENTS SOME HOPING THAT SHE'S GOING TO BE CONFIRMED BY THE SENATE. NOW pPERSPECTIVE I THINK MANY OF THE CHALLENGES WE'RE DISCUSSING TODAY. PREDATED THE NIXON ADMINISTRATION AND REPRESENT YEARS OF THIS FUNCTIONALITY AND FRANKLY INDUSTRY CAPTURE. OF THIS BUREAU SO MY FIRST QUESTION IS AROUND- FOCUSES ON THE FRST ISSUE RAISED AND A COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. AROUND ADVISORY COMMITTEE. IT'S WELL KNOWN THIS BEER HOUSING ADVISORY COMMITTEE THAT BY ALL ACCOUNTS. HAS BEEN WEEK BY NATURE. WITHOUT DIRECT OVERSIGHT OF THE BUREAU WITHOUT DIRECT VOTING POWER OVER REGULATORY ACTIONS. SUCH AS DISAPPOINTING OR CLOSING THE SCHOOL. AND I'LL JUST NOTE IT'S CURRENTLY LED BY AN ATTORNEY. WHO REPRESENTS FOR PROFIT SCHOOLS INCLUDING. THE CORINTHIAN COLLEGES WHEN IT CLOSED WHICH- STRIKES MANY OF US AS THE FOX GUARDING THE HEN HOUSE. I WANT TO ASK. THE BUREAU. DO YOU THINK THAT WE SHOULD BE EXAMINING WHETHER THIS ADVISORY COMMITTEE SHOULD BE REPLACED BY A STRONGER. BOARD FORMAT WHICH IS MORE COMMON. TO OTHER ELEMENTS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS SAY THE STATE MEDICAL BOARD WHICH CAN VOTE TO TAKE AWAY. DOCTORS LICENSES. YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER TO PAY THAT- AS WE LOOK TO THIS PERIL. PLAY VERY MUCH SENATE BY. ROLE AND WE DO LOOK AT THEM GIVE US GUIDANCE AND FOR MIKE INFORMATION ON THE TOPIC BEFORE AT. WELL THEY AREN'T AN ACTUAL VOTING BODY THEY DO PROVIDE THAT NEEDED FEEDBACK ON ON THE INDUSTRY. ON SOME OF THE THINGS THEY PROVIDE FEEDBACK ON OUR ON REGULATIONS THAT THEY'RE GOING THROUGH I'M LEGISLATION WE TALK TO THEM AND GET THEIR FEEDBACK ON LEGISLATION. I'M ALSO JUST LOOKING AT BUDGET OPERATIONS AND JUST THE OVERALL PROGRESS THAT THE ACTUAL- ZERO IT TAKING THROUGHOUT THE YEAR- THE ADVISORY. COMMITTEE DOES PLAY A VITAL ROLE IN PROVIDING BOTH RECOMMENDATION. I'M AT THIS ADVISORY COMMITTEE TO SET IDENTIFIED THE ROLE HE'S ACTUALLY PROVIDED A HANDFUL OF THEM I'M KINDA LIKE A PROCEDURE MANUAL THAT THEY NEED. AND THAT WE COULD ACTUALLY LOOKED AT THE ACTUAL DISCUSSION OF WHETHER DENNIS ADVISORY COMMITTEE SHOULD BE TURNED INTO A BOARD SIMILAR LIKE OUR OTHER BOARD WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT BUT WERE REALLY HAPPY TO. THINK ABOUT THAT AND DISCUSS THAT WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND IF THAT IS- SOMETHING THAT YOU WANT TO PROCEED I'M DEFINITELY WE WANT. TO LOOK AT THAT WE ACTUALLY HAVE EVIDENCE ON THAT- ADVISORY COMMITTEE AS WELL WE'VE JUST RECENTLY APPOINTED A NEW- STUDENT MEMBER. INDIVIDUAL THAT REPRESENT STUDENT ON THE COMMITTEE I'M SO WE THINK THAT WE HAVE A BROAD. IMPACT FROM THAT INDIVIDUAL GIVING US DIRECTION BUT YOU ARE CORRECT IT DOES NOT AFFECT THE SAME AS IT WOULD IF IT WERE UP FOR IT BUT IT IS SOMETHING WE'RE DEFINITELY. I'M WILLING THE FACT THE LEGISLATURE. I APPRECIATE THAT I DO THINK IT'S A WERE THE TOPIC OF- CONSIDERATION FOR US- MY SECOND QUESTION. ADDRESSES THE FACT THE COMEDIAN ALSO SUMMARIZE SOME OF THE MAJOR LAWS THE BUREAU SUPPOSED TO OVERSEE. WHICH HAPPENS TO INCLUDE ONE OF MINE AB THIRTEEN FORTY FROM TWENTY NINETEEN. AND TO REFRESH OUR LAW WAS PROPOSED AFTER THE TRUMP. ADMINISTRATION ELIMINATED THE OLD BOMB AND THEN. GAME EMPLOYMENT RULE. WHICH FOUNDER ROBERT HUNDRED FIFTH CAL PER. WERE NOT WELL SERVING FIFTIES THOUSAND. WHO ALMOST OF DOLLARS IN DEBT. AS YOU MAY KNOW THE PROFIT. PER THIS BILL. YOUR BUREAU ASKED US TO WATER DOWN. AND SINCE IT. NOW TWO AGO. IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE BUREAU HASN'T PROMULGATED REGULATIONS. HASN'T BEEN PROACTIVE IN DOING OUTREACH TO SCHOOLS TO ENSURE THE CRITICAL COLLECTION OF DATA. SO THAT OUR STUDENTS KNOW WHAT SCHOOLS ME GOING THEY MAY BE GOING TO. AND I WILL ALSO SAY AS A BILL IS GOING THROUGH THE PROCESS THE BEER WAS SUPPOSED TO AMEND. YOUR I. T. CONTRACTS TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE BILL. ONE UNDERSTAND- WHAT HAS HAPPENED WHAT WHY HAVE THESE ACTIONS NOT HAPPENED. ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHU ADDS THAT THE BILL AB THIRTEEN FORTY EIGHT SOMETHING THAT THAT. THAT APPRECIATE. ACTUALLY IT'S VERY SUPPORT OF THIS BILL- AND WE REALLY WANTED TO MOVE IT FORWARD. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE AND FEW SIP MENTIONED IT'S THAT- BILL DOES REQUIRED THAT IF THERE ARE IMPROVEMENTS AND CHANGES IN THE CURRENT- I. T. THAT IS OUT THERE. AND SO WHAT WE DID IT WE WERE GOING. THROUGH THAT- THAT WHERE OUR BID MODEL. PROCESS WE KNEW THAT WE ITSELF IN THE MIDDLE WE WANT TO IN THE OFF. AND SO WHAT WE AGREED TO THAT WE WOULD WAIT AND THEY- ENTITY THAT THAT OFFENDER AND THAT IN. THAT'S BEING. TO THE BILL ON THAT I HE SAID. ONE IT AFTER MET THEN WE WOULD LOVE AT IN. THIS MODEL AND I HAVE ACTUALLY ARE DEPUTY CHIEF ALSO AT THIS AT THE TO THE TWELVE BUT I WANT TO GIVE YOU WHERE WE ON THE FIVE DAY. SO THAT'S- WE ROLLED THE FIRST STEP OF IT SEPTEMBER TWENTY- I BET HAPPENED IT WAS TOO FAR IN THE ADDAMS INFORMATION ON WE'RE GOING THROUGH HERE AND CONTINUING TO ROLL OUT IN DIFFERENT PHASES INTENTIONAL- ACTIVITIES AND IMPROVEMENTS IN OUR IT SYSTEM AS YOU KNOW. THE SYSTEM OF THAT ANTIQUATED SYSTEM THAT WE HAD BUT IN ORDER TO IMPLEMENT YOUR BILL WE DO HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT SYSTEM IS READY AND SO THE PLAN IS DEFINITELY IT AT THAT- IF THE INTERFERE WITH THAT I IS ROLLED OUT. AND LIFE TO SEE WHETHER WHERE THEY'RE NEEDED AND THEN AT THAT POINT WE WOULD BE LOOKING TO- GATHERED THE INFORMATION AND IF WE HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY- THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE MAY NEED TO DO TO. PROVIDE A PROJECT- DOCUMENTS HIT THEM- THAT WOULD BE AT- SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO GET WERE HOPING THAT THAT IS NOT THE CASE AND THEN AT THAT POINT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO EMPLOY. I'M AT THIRTEEN FORTY EIGHT AFTER THAT MUCH NEEDED INFORMATION AND I KNOW THAT AS FAR AS THAT INFORMATION AND PROVIDING INFORMATION TO STAFF- MISTER ABOUT THIRTY ALREADY HAD GATHERING SOME OF THAT INFORMATION AND GETTING THAT TOO. I'M GOOD AT- AND I WILL ACTUALLY HAVE HIM ALSO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT THEY DO WITH THE INFORMATION WHEN THEY GATHER IT MR ABOUT FORTY IF YOU CAN ALSO ADD ON TO THE. TO THE- QUESTION- BUT THANK YOU FOR THAT- SO IN IN- TO. YOU KNOW WE'RE WILL WHAT AWARE OF YOU KNOW THE THAT THE- YEAH. BE UNINTENDED AND- OF WHAT THIRTEEN FOR WILL GIVE. AND IN THAT. IN AROUND THAT TIME TO FILL. WE GET THERE TERMS OF THE TECH. TO BE ABLE TO DO- THE MATCHING IT CETERA. NOW WE HAVE TAKEN UP FOR IN OUR COVERAGE CONTENT. TO SPEAK WITH PERSON. STUDENTS ABOUT I THINK THE THEY CAN. ABOUT BE. TO GET THE NEW PRE IN HOME DISCLOSURES ARE. THE SCHOOL BUT- BAKSHI YEAH. DOING- EMPLOY. SURVEY ACT THEM YOU ARE. MANAGEMENT WITH A LOT OF TOOLS THAT ARE ALSO- THAT WILL. HELP THEM MAKE MORE IN. DECISIONS AND A BETTER I. OF THEY'RE- BURNING WOULD BE INTEGRATORS. FROM THE HIGH SCHOOL. THAT ARE- RESEARCH- WE CONNECT. WITH LOCAL. WORKFORCE DRAMATIC FOR. AS WELL. AND I DO EVERYTHING CAN HELP THOSE RESPECT STUDENTS. MAKE ONE OF THE STATE WHICH WERE ONLY BE- MORSE. BY OF THIRTY FORTY. AND WE HAVE THAT. SO I'M LET ME JUST WITH A CUP COMMENTS A THAT FIRST ALL VERY MUCH OF. YOU STATING THAT THE BEER IS A OF THE EMBLEM OF OUR BILL I WILL STATE THAT HAS FRANKLY NOT BEEN THE EXPERIENCE OF OUR OFFICE. AS WE WERE WORKING ON A BILL MOVING THROUGH THE PROCESS AND WE VERY MUCH WOULD LIKE TO GET A FULL UPDATE OF WHAT'S HAPPENING AROUND AB THIRTEEN FORTY BECAUSE AGAIN. REGULATIONS HAVEN'T BEEN PROMULGATED WE'RE NOT AWARE OF DIRECT OUTREACH TO SCHOOLS AROUND DATA ANY ANY REFERENCE TO DELAYS AND I. T. AND I JUST ONE NOTE. AS AS YOU WELL KNOW BECAUSE I SERVE IN THE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE THAT OVERSEES- BUDGET EXPENDITURES IN THIS AREA YOUR APARTMENT BROADLY SPEAKING DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS. HAS BEEN INCREDIBLY CHALLENGING PERFORMING IT MODERNIZATION PROJECTS AND I'LL SAY THAT AS YOU KNOW THE BUREAU. STARTED THIS CONVERSATION CLOSE TO FIVE YEARS AGO- BROWN MODERNIZATION AND WE ARE STILL WAITING- AND I APPRECIATE THE UPDATE TODAY ON THE STATUS OF THE PLAN BUT- I HAVE TO SAY WELL ALL EYES OF THE PUBLIC AROUND EDT AT THE MOMENT. FROM MY PERSPECTIVE THE FAILURES OF IT MODERNIZATION WITHIN YOU SEE A PARTICULARLY IN THIS DEPARTMENT IS SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTING OUR ABILITY TO TAKE CARE OF OUR STUDENTS AND- I'M WONDERING IF YOU COULD TELL ME HOW MANY YEARS BEHIND. AND HOW MANY MILLIONS OF DOLLARS A WEEK BEHIND WHEN IT COMES. TO MONETIZATION OF THIS PROJECT. THIS PROJECT IT. YOU KNOW I MEMBER TO I'VE BEEN WITH THE SUPPORT ALONG TIME I READ. HERE WE HAD- IT IT IS DIFFERENT PLAN THE REPORT WILL ROLLED OUT AND I KNOW THAT THOSE ARE SOME OF THE ISSUES. BUT THEN IT PROJECT I HAVE TO TELL YOU IS WHERE WE LEARN FROM SOME OF THE THINGS THAT IN THE PAST HAD HAPPENED THAT WORK. LEARN FROM WHERE WE CAME FROM BASICALLY. THEIR ENTIRE BUSINESS MODERNIZATION PROJECT HAS BEEN COMPLETELY AGILE AND VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE WAY THAT THE FIRE PROJECT WAS PUT IN- WE HAVE ORGANIZATION CHANGE MANAGEMENT WE HAVE INDIVIDUALS THAT CAME IN AND LOOK AT THESE PROGRAMS AND HOW THEY WOULD GET. I HE- TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE BOARD AND ZERO- FROM THE GET GO WHAT ARE THE POSSIBLE TO LET HIM PLAY THEY WENT THROUGH EVERY PROPER THAT THEY LOOK AT CHANGES THAT NEEDED TO BE MADE. SO THAT I CAN LEARNING FROM PAST MISTAKES THIS ENTIRE UNIT FOR THEIR BUSINESS MODERNIZATION FOR THIS PARTICULAR GIRL HAVE BEEN VERY DIFFERENT THAN ANYTHING ELSE. ON THE DATE THAT I BELIEVE THE TOTAL COSTS AROUND A LITTLE OVER THREE MILLION DOLLARS FOR WHAT HAS BEEN PUT IN FOR THIS. SPECIFIC ENTITY- AND WE ARE ON TARGET IT'S NOT BEHIND IN SCHEDULE I KNOW THAT THEY WERE PART OF THE PARADE THREE LEAF THREE. BUT WHEN WE CHANGED- HE SAID YOU TO THE GUIDANCE OF THE LEGISLATURE WHEN WE CHANGE PROFIT THEN WE DECIDED THAT WE WERE GOING TO LOOK. AT THEM. AS A BUSINESS MODERNIZATION PROJECT THAT CHANGE THE WAY WE WENT AND NEVER COURSES. AND GET HIS REALLY BEEN FOR THE BENEFIT OF THIS PROGRAM AND THEIR AFTER AWHILE ROLLOUT THAT WE- HAD ALLOW THEM AFTER. READ WE THINK A LOT EARLIER THAN WE WOULD HAVE BEEN THE PAST NOW WE HAVE. WE HAVE- INDIVIDUAL TO DO UP WITH. LOOK WHAT THE APPLE. FOR AND END OF IT SYSTEM ONLINE. AND THEN WE'RE RIGHT NOW- AB. MY ALL OF THE IN. FROM THE OLD ANTIQUATED SYSTEM THE NEW SYSTEM DOING AB FOUR STILL WORK. HERE'S FROM WHEN THE CONVERSATION STARTED AROUND SO CALLED BUSINESS PROCESS MODERNIZATION. THAT TO ME DOESN'T STRIKE ME AS AS ADULTS LET ME JUST CONCLUDE WITH ONE STATEMENT- WE RECEIVED A LETTER FROM A BROAD COALITION OF HIGHER ED. CIVIL RIGHTS CONSUMER STUDENT AND VETERAN AFFAIR. BUT BEEN ON ADVOCATES. WHO PROPOSED A NUMBER OF RECOMMENDATIONS- THAT I DON'T THINK WE'RE DIRECTLY ADDRESSED. IN YOUR ANALYSIS TO IMPROVE THE STATE FUND. TO REQUIRE PROGRAMS TO PREPARE STUDENTS FOR LICENSURE OR CERTIFICATION IN FIELDS. OR LICENCES AND CERTIFICATES REQUIRED. TO EXPAND THE DATA TO SUPPORT CRADLE TO CAREER DATA SYSTEMS. ANTM REMOVE EXEMPTIONS IN NONPROFIT CONVERSION PROTECTIONS. MY HOPE IS THAT WE WILL BE CONSIDERING THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS AND- AGAIN WOULD LIKE TO ASK YOU IF YOU HAVE A PERSPECTIVE ON THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT YOU DID NOT INCLUDE. IN YOUR ANALYSIS. YEAH WE WE'VE LOOKED AT THAT LETTER AND WE APPRECIATE ANY ANYTIME INDIVIDUALS ARE ARE PROVIDING THAT WAY THAT WE CAN IMPROVE OUR PROCESSES IS A GOOD THING TO US AND SO WE REALLY FIFTY TYPICAL LETTER FROM THAT COALITION OF GROUPS. ON GET SOMETHING WE WILL DEFINITELY LOOK AT AND WE'RE HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE AS WE DEFINE AND I IDENTIFIED. WITH ONE OF THOSE SUGGESTED RECOMMENDATIONS MOVE FORWARD- AND WE'RE HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU YOUR STAFF AS WELL AS ALL OF THE COMMITTEE STAFF IN MOVING THE THING FORWARD- ABHI IDENTIFIED THE NEED FOR THEM. THANKS VERY MUCH- TO THE TERRORIST THANK YOU FOR INTELLIGENCE. THE YOU SO MUCH A CELL ONE FOR BY SEN MEMBER ME. THANK YOU- MY COLLEAGUES SAN FRANCISCO CHAREDI BONDS AND A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO I INTRODUCED LEGISLATION AB NINETEEN SIXTEEN TO REQUIRE PRIVATE POST SECONDARY SCHOOLS THE FIRE FILE A THIRTY BOND- POSTED WITH B. P. P. AND ADAM OUT COMPATIBLE WITH TUITION AND FEES IMPOSED ON THE STUDENTS AND THEN IN THE EVENT THAT A SCHOOL CLOSES- IT COULD BE USED FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS- GOING BEYOND WHAT AS TO EUROPE- COVERS COULD YOU PLEASE ELABORATE. ON THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF- AMENDING STATUTE TO GRANT BPP THE AUTHORITY TO- REQUIRE ASSUREDLY BOND. YES DEFINITELY AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WAS PLACED INTO OUR ON PAPER AND PARCHMENT THAT REPORT AS YOU MENTIONED AND SO IT IS SOMETHING THAT WE LOOK AT- WE THINK THAT THERE WOULD BE A LOT OF BENEFITS TO IT AS YOU KNOW RIGHT NOW IN AND OUT HAVE METRIC READY ALSO- WEIGHED IN ON THIS AS WELL BUT- AS YOU KNOW RIGHT NOW THAT WE KNOW FULL CLOSES THERE'S A LOT OF DEBT THAT IS LEFT- AND RIGHT NOW IT. WOULD BE THE BUREAU TO THE MOST PART I'M THEIR TRANSCRIPTS THAT THESE INDIVIDUALS NEED TO BE ABLE TO GET TO TRANSFER TO OTHER SCHOOLS THERE'S MAINTENANCE OF THOSE TRANSCRIPTS THERE'S MAINTENANCE OF THE WHOLE RECORD THERE'S HE FELT THAT NEED TO HAPPEN- WITH THE STUDENTS- THERE'S ALSO JUST BASICALLY HAVING. AN INDIVIDUAL THAT YOU CAN GO TO GET ANY OTHER TYPES OF RECORDS WITH THE SCHOOL ALL OF THE THERE ARE WE HAVE- OUR STAFF TO ITS FLEET TRAVEL TO THESE CLOTHES SCHOOL- TO EXCESS ARE OLD PARKING GO DOWN AND HELP INDIVIDUALS- WITH BEING ABLE TO APPLY FOR STRIP CLEAN. ALL OF THAT- IT IS BASICALLY AND I'M ELEMENT THAT THAT FALLS INTO THAT ZERO SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE RECOMMENDED IN OUR- RECOMMENDATIONS OF NEW INITIATIVES IN THE COMFORT REPORT IS THE POTENTIAL FOR HAVING A SECURITY BOND THAT WOULD COVER A LOT OF THE SPOT WE THINK THAT. IT WOULD BE A BENEFIT WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO COVER COSTS ANDNOT HAVE IT COME OUT OF THE BUREAU AND IT WOULD PUT THAT ON PAYMENT BACK ON THE SCHOOL WITH ACTUALLY I AM THE ONE WHO IS IT POPPING THAT INDEBTEDNESS AND THAT'S WHAT FREDDIE IF YOU. HAVE ANYTHING TO ADD PLEASE ITSELF. AND YEAH THANK YOU. DEFINITELY THIS IS YOUR BOND WE BELIEVE FOR. HELL THE STATE AND IN A WAY THAT. IT'S THE WHAT. WE CANNOT. DO AT THE PARK. OF BEING ABLE TO ALLOW. AND I. TO THEY ARE TO HELP DIDN'T. OUT THEIR- AND- REPEAT THE RECORDS THAT THEY TO RECEIVE A ORDER. TO BUT ON. THAT WE WEREN'T ABLE TO. GET UP IN TWENTY FIFTEEN BUT THE- FINANCIALLY IT'S TIME TO TRY AGAIN. THANK YOU SEVEN ONE IRVINE ASSEMBLY MEMBER BERMAN FOLLOWED BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER FALL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH CARILLO AND I'D LIKE TO- JUST SECOND THE COMMENTS MADE BY MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN FRANCISCO AND FROM HER VENTURA COUNTY- IN TERMS OF THEIR CONCERNS THAT THEY HAVE ALSO- I WAS EXCITED TO HEAR THAT- MISS COCHRAN'S GONNA BE TAKING OVER THE BUREAU OF HAD THE PLEASURE OF WORKING WITH HER ON MY STAFF AND I HAVE. A HIGHER EDUCATION WORK THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING AND I THINK TO BE A GREAT ADVOCATE FOR STUDENT VOICES- AND PROTECTING STUDENTS IN THE BUREAU WHICH IS SHOULD BE IN MY MIND THE SOLE FOCUS OF THE BUREAU. I'VE RUN TWO BILLS- THAT WOULD INCREASE IN STRENGTH AND REGULATIONS OF THE PRIVATE FOR PROFIT SECTOR AND BOTH TIMES INCLUDING MY FIRST YEAR WITH IT WHEN IT WAS QUITE A SURPRISE TO ME. COLLEAGUES WOULD SAY I SUPPORT WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO I THINK WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO IS NECESSARY BUT I DON'T HAVE FAITH THAT THE BUREAU CAN HANDLE ADDITIONAL RESPONSIBILITY- AND THAT WAS INCREDIBLY DISCOURAGING TO HEAR- AND WE'D WORK ON THE POLICIES IN THE BILLS- AND ALSO- WORK ON MY COLLEAGUES CONFIDENCE TO GET THE VOTES NECESSARY. WE WERE NOT SUCCESSFUL THE FIRST TIME- WE WERE SUCCESSFUL THE SECOND TIME MAINLY BECAUSE WE MOVED A LOT OF THE REGULATION TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE- AND NOT TO THE BUREAU- AND SO I AND- VERY INTERESTED. IN WHAT WE'RE GONNA BE DOING THIS YEAR- TO. REFORM THE BUREAU TO STRENGTHEN THE PROTECTIONS FOR STUDENTS TO MAKE SURE THAT. YOU HAVE THE RESOURCES THAT YOU NEED AND THAT THE SYSTEM IS SET UP PROPERLY- BUT ALSO TO MAKE SURE THAT THE RESPONSIBILITY- IS. IT AND THE FOCUS IS WHERE IT SHOULD BE. WHICH IS ON PROTECTING STUDENTS. WHO IN CALIFORNIA AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY FAR TOO OFTEN. FIND THEMSELVES BEING TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF- BYE BYE PREDATORY AND UNSCRUPULOUS- PRIVATE PERFECT FOR PROFIT COLLEGES. SOME ARE GREAT. AND SOME ARE NOT- AND IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE THE DATA NECESSARY TO BE ABLE TO EVALUATE WHICH ONES ARE WHICH- AND THEN WITH THAT WE HAVE THE REGULATIONS AND LAWS. NECESSARY TO BE ABLE TO PROPERLY REGULATE THOSE THAT ARE MISBEHAVING. SO I WAS ENCOURAGED TO SEE. ONE OF THE BIGGER ISSUES THAT CAME UP A LOT WAS THE NUMBER OF THE BACKLOG OF COMPLAINTS- AND I WAS ENCOURAGED TO SEE THAT THE NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS. HAS DECREASED BY ABOUT EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT- BUT I WAS DISCOURAGED TO SEE. THAT TWO THIRDS OF THE COMPLAINTS. WERE CLOSE BECAUSE THE COMPLAINT COULD NOT BE SUBSTANTIATED. OR THE BUREAU DETERMINED IT DID NOT HAVE JURISDICTION- SO I GUESS ONE QUESTION IS. WHAT'S THE BREAKDOWN HOW MANY WORDS WERE CLOSED BECAUSE THE COMPLAINT COULD NOT BE SUBSTANTIATED. HOW MANY WERE CLOSE BECAUSE- THE BUREAU ARE DETERMINED THAT IT DID NOT HAVE JURISDICTION- WHAT WAS THE PROCESS. FOR COMING UP WITH THOSE DETERMINATIONS. AND DOES THE LEGISLATURE NEED TO PROVIDE- EXPAND THE SCOPE. OF THE BUREAU'S RESPONSIBILITIES. TO ALLOW IT TO- INVESTIGATE MORE THESE COMPLAINTSTHAT IT DETERMINED THEY DON'T HAVE JURISDICTION YOU DON'T HAVE JURISDICTION OVER. ASSEMBLY MEMBER BERMAN- AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONTINUED FIGHTING WITH ON YOUR LEGISLATION FOR THIS ZERO. I WANT TO GO OVER THE FAUCET THAT HAPPENED WITH THE ENFORCEMENT- AND LOOKING AT THOSE THINGS I DO HAVE- SOME OF THAT THAT HE DID SO INFORMATION I HAVE IS FROM THE TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN- PROFIT THAT IT WENT THROUGH. AND CLOSING OUT THOSE CASES- JUST REAL QUICKLY I CAN GIVE YOU THE INFORMATION WE CAN GET BACK TO YOU WITH ADDITIONAL- DATA AS WELL. I'VE BEEN LOOKING AT JEFF. INDISPOSED CASES THAT CAME FORWARD ABOUT 90% OF THEM WERE ACTUALLY NONTRADITIONAL WHERE THEY WERE CLOSED COOL OR- AND WHEN THAT HAPPENED WE WOULD REFER THE MATTER ON. CORRECT THAT'S ONE THING WE WERE GOING THROUGH THAT PROCESS AND JUST TO GIVE ME A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND ON THE ACTUALLY HAD IT YEP I CRACKED I DIDN'T KNOW THAT THAT'S THE CASE IN FRONT OF DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS PASSPORT. IN AND ARE IN THE GOOD THAT WERE AT AT. LEVEL OF INVESTIGATOR WHERE THEY BOTH WENT IN AND EVALUATED THE- AND WHAT THEY REALLY DID IT ALSO WHILE THEY WERE DOING THEIR EVALUATIONS THEY WERE ACTING TRAINING BUT BASS. AND ASSISTING THEM AND BEING ABLE TO REVIEW PAPERS AND MAKE CHANGES THAT THEY WENT FORWARD. AND SO WHEN THEY WENT THROUGH AND LOOKED AT THE CASE WITH THE ULTIMATE LIKE THAT- INFORMATION THAT THEY HAVE SO 90% OF THOSE WORKLOADS. HOLD WORLD AND SO THEY REFERRED A PATIENT OVER TO STRICTER THEY COULD REACH OUT TO STUDENTS AND ASSESS THEM ON BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH THEY COULDN'T TAKE ACTION AGAINST THE SCHOOL THERE WERE STILL STUDENTS THAT WERE HARMED AND POTENTIALLY IN NEED OF FILING A CLAIM SO THAT'S WHAT THEY GET. THERE WERE ALSO THOSE THAT WE'RE NOT PERFECT ABOUT 12% OF THOSE THAT WERE REFERRED TO ANOTHER AGENCY I'M AT BECAUSE THEY'VE WORKED ON THIRD BEAT THAT- OR THEY WERE EXACT- YOU HE SAID FOR EXAMPLE- BOTH OF WERE. INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE BOTH WERE 13% BOTH BOTH WORK WELL BECAUSE. I'M WHILE THEY MADE. THE ISSUE IS WORRIED THAT WHEN THY WERE LOOKING AT THE INFORMATION FROM UNIT THAT HAD BEEN PROMOTED FROM ABOUT WHAT OLD THOSE WHO ARE REQUIRED TO KEEP INFORMATION FOR OVER FIVE YEARS AND THEY HAD WAITED FOR EITHER FILED A COMPLAINT WORKING ON MY- OR IT'S BEEN PENDING WITH. ZERO IF IT DIDN'T MEET THAT CRITERIA WHAT. THE TEAM DID IF THEY LOOKED AT OKAY IF THEY'RE FROM OTHER AVENUES THAT WE CAN'T TAKE ACTION RIGHT NOW BE ON FACE ON THIS COMPLAINT. WE FOR THE OVER FOR A COMPLIANCE INSPECTION WE ADDED TO THE INFORMATION THAT'S GOING TO BE GIVEN- UP FOR FUTURE REVIEW OF THAT WELL AS BOTH INDIVIDUAL GO OUT. THE OTHER THING THAT THEY DID SOME OF THEM ARE CRIMINAL MATTERS AND SO THEY REPORT THEM ON FOR CRIMINAL ON ACTION AND THEN IF THAT ENTITY TOOK ACTION TO GET FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE THAT THEY COULD HAPPEN THEN IT WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT THE FEAR WOULD BE ABLE TO TAKE ACTION ON. AND THE OTHER THING THAT THEY DID SOME OF THAT STUDENT PAPERS THAT WORK THEY WERE LOOKING OUT BECAUSE LIKE YOU KNOW WHAT THIS BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT THAT LARGE NUMBER SOME OF THEM ONCE THEY STARTED CRAWLING BUT STUDENTS. THEY HAD ACTUALLY ALREADY BEEN- BROUGHT MADE WHOLE BASICALLY SO- THAT THEY NEED WITH MATHEMATICS IN EITHER THEIR PRACTICAL BEEN PROVIDED OR THEY WERE WERE WE INVOLVED KIND OF THINGS HAPPEN SO THAT PRICING PLANT SO THEY WERE ABLE TO BE CLOSE COMPLAINTS OF PAIN. AND THEN THE LAST THING THAT THEY GET IT IN A LOT OF THE PAPERS THAT COMPLAINTS THAT WERE PROVIDED THEY DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION TO BE LOOKED AT- AND SO THEY THEY TRIED TO CONTACT THE STUDENTS A LOT OF THE STUDENTS WERE NOT AVAILABLE THEY DID WHAT THEY COULD IN LOOKING AT WILL RECORD BUT IF THEY HAD IDENTIFIED A TEACHER THAT WAS A PROBLEM OR THINGS LIKE THAT. THEY LOOK AT THE POLL RECORDS TO TRY TO IDENTIFY THOSE INDIVIDUALS AND IF THEY WEREN'T ABLE TO THEY DID HAVE TO CLOSE THE CASE BECAUSE THERE WAS NO OTHER ACTIVITY THAT COULD BE TAKEN. SO I LOOKED AT THAT I'VE I'VE MET WITH THE GRANDMOTHER THEIR STAFF POPULAR INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE GONE THROUGH THAT PROCESS- I AND I DO BELIEVE THAT THEY- ARE. APPROPRIATELY ANALYZE. AND REVIEW THOSE PAPERS. AND THEN THE INFORMATION THAT WE PROVIDED THAT WE BELIEVE THAT THERE'S A LOT THAT NEEDS TO BE STRENGTHENED I'M BACK ONE OF THEM WE BELIEVE THAT IT NEEDS TO BE ALLOWED TO EVEN IF THEY'RE THAT IT DOESN'T HAVE TO HAVE. YOU KNOW I'M PRUDENT IT HAD TO BE A POTENTIAL PERSON ON LIKE OUR OTHER PORTLAND BUREAUS WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS. AND THEN WE ALSO HAVE A CASE IN THE BACK ON PAPER OTHER AREAS WHERE WE NEED PEOPLE THEY'RE GETTING APPROVED OTHER PLACES WHERE WE NEED TO HAVE- STRONGER LAWS AND REGULATIONS AND SO THAT'S. WHY WE REALLY WANT TO PARTNER WITH. AND LOOKING AT WAYS THAT. THAT THERE ARE- ENFORCEMENT AND I DO WANNA- IT'S A GREAT IF HE- ANYTHING TO ADD. WELCOME HE WAS- IT VERY. WITH THAT THE PLOT. ERECTOR YEAH THAT. DIDN'T HAS BEEN ONE. WITH THE BUREAU FOR SOME. AND JUST A LITTLE BIT. AND IT'S EIGHT. THAT WE HAVE FOR EXAMPLE- BIG. THAT WE WORK. WITH HEAT OR CARBON PROPERTY. OR WE WERE ABLE TO. DETERMINE THAT STUDENTS WERE ACTUALLY A- COURSES. OR AND WERE AT A- TO SIMPLY STUDY YEAH I'M- THAT WE WERE UNABLE TO. MOVE WITH. EIGHTY AND BENEFIT OF ACTION. DUE TO THE FACT OF NOT. AN STUDENT COMING FORWARD CLAIMING THAT THEY'VE BEEN HARMED AND SOME OF THE STUDENTS WERE ABLE TO HAPPEN EXAMINATIONS THEREFORE THEY WERE MADE WHOLE NAY RECEIVE THEIR LICENSES AND THEN OTHER STUDENTS JUST WOULD NOT COME FOR IT. AND BE WITNESSES AS BEING PROVEN THAT THEY ACTUALLY WERE HARMED BY THE SCHOOL. THANK YOU. THANK THANK YOU SO A QUICK FOLLOW UP SO WHEN YOU MIGHT HAVE COVERED THIS IN IN THE DIFFERENT BREAKDOWNS BUT WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THE CASES WERE DISMISSED AS NON JURISDICTIONAL AND IN TOTAL. AND HE DOES THAT OKAY. YES SORRY THERE WERE TWO DIFFERENT TYPE OF NON FICTIONAL ONE OF FICTIONAL- WITH THEM BEING CLOSE SCHOOL WORK I'M REFER TO STRIP AND WITH MY PERCENT AND THEN THE OTHER HUNDRED ALL THAT WE TO LIKE ANOTHER AGENCY OR THE ENTITY A DAMP OF THAT THAT THAT COULDN'T TAKE HALF WITH TWELVE. OF 1% OKAY. M. THEN IT AND YOU WERE. THIS IS BIT IN YOUR BUT WE WHAT'S FOR. DOES B. P. P. DUE TO CONNECT ON BETWEEN. POTENTIALLY NON JURISDICTION COMPLAINTS AND ENFORCEMENT CASES- THAT COMPLAINTS COULD POTENTIALLY EVEN IF INDIRECTLY INFORMED. I'M SORRY ASSEMBLY MEMBER MAN COULD YOU REPEAT THAT QUESTION- OF COURSE SO IT'S A WHAT WHAT DOES THE BUREAU DUE TO CONNECT THE DOTS BETWEEN. POTENTIALLY NON JURISDICTIONAL COMPLAINTS AND ENFORCEMENT CASES THAT THOSE COMPLAINTS COULD POTENTIALLY- EVEN IF INDIRECTLY INFORM. LEAVE THAT. YEAH SO- ME. THE ENFORCEMENT UNANIMOUS. LOOK AT EACH COMPLAINT OF THE CONTENT INDIVIDUALLY AND WE LOOK AT IT SEE IF IT IN ANY TYPE OF VIOLATION OF ANY OF OUR LAWS OR REGULATIONS AND WE CAN LOOK AT IT AND MORE IN DEPTH NOT TO FOR FACE VALUE AND THEN IT DOES GO TO MY MANAGER AND THE MANAGER TAKES A DOUBLE LOOK AT IT TO ENSURE THAT- THAT IT REALLY IS. NONFERROUS SO WE HAVE KIND OF A TWO. PROCESS WHAT WE LOOK AT IT IT'S AN INTAKE OF IT AND WE ALSO LOOK AT IT AT THE CLOSE RATHER TO JUST ENSURE THAT. GOSH OF ADDITIONALLY I WOULD LIKE TO ADD THAT THERE MAY BE TIMES THAT- ONCE WE START THE INVESTIGATION THAT WE FIND THAT IT'S NONTRADITIONAL. OKAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ASSEMBLY MEMBER FALL. BUT THANK YOU TEARS. I WOULD LIKE TO FOCUS I GUESS ON THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM WHICH IS- THE FEES AND THE OPERATIONAL COSTS OF THE- OF THE BPP- IN MY UNDERSTANDING AND CERTAINLY AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY- THESE INSTITUTES ON A NUMBER OF THESE INSTITUTIONS PROVIDE- CRITICAL PATHWAYS. FOR STUDENTS IN THE MEDICAL FIELD IN IN INTO NURSING- AND- THE SCHOOLS CERTAINLY AS WELL AS EVERYONE HAS BEEN STRUGGLING TO PERSEVERE TO THIS PANDEMIC. AND- NO DURING THIS TIME OF UNCERTAINTY- I WOULD THINK THAT WE WOULD WANT TO PROVIDE SOME STABILITY TO THE SCHOOLS SO CAN YOU KIND OF GO WALK ME THROUGH THE- DEADLINE SET OR THE PERSPECTIVE OF. WHY THESE FEE INCREASES ARE SO SUBSTANTIAL- WHY THEY'RE NECESSARY- ESPECIALLY SINCE IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT- FEES WERE INCREASED IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN- AS A WERE HAVING INSTITUTIONS ARE LOOKING- POSSIBLY PAYING UPWARDS TO NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS- YOU KNOW TO. TO TRY TO PROVIDE SINCE THE MEDICATION- AND THEN COULD YOU ALSO ADDRESS HOW THE FEE INCREASE PROPOSAL- COINCIDES WITH THE INFORMATION THE INSTITUTIONAL CAPS THAT CURRENTLY EXISTS IN LAW. YES YOU'RE RIGHT THIS IS THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM I WOULD AGREE WITH YOU- BECAUSE WITH WITHOUT THE SOLVENCY OF THAT YEAR- WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO DO A LOT OF THE WORK THAT WE HAVE STARTED ALREADY AND SO ON I JUST I WANT TO WALK YOU THROUGH THIS IT MAY TAKE ME A MINUTE TO GET THROUGH IT SO I APOLOGIZE IN ADVANCE FOR THE LEAD RESPONSE- FIRST OF. IT IN REGARDS TO THE FIRE FEE INCREASE- THAT DID OCCUR- I MEAN LET AND THE BACK UP JUST A LITTLE BIT MARC FIRST OF ALL THIS IS VERY DIFFERENT ALL OF THE OTHER PAYROLL QUICK EXAMPLE WITHIN THE OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS AND THEIR PAY STRUCTURE IS INCREDIBLY COMPLEX- THEY HAVE INDIVIDUAL APPLICATION FEES AND THEY HAVE REMOTE BE IF WHEN INDIVIDUALS COME FORWARD THAT ARE DIFFERENT THAN- THE NORMAL READING ALL BECAUSE THEY FALL OUT INSPECTIONS AND THINGS LIKE THAT- AND THEN THEY HAVE THE ANNUAL FEE THAT IS BASICALLY- MADE FUN A PERCENTAGE OF THE ANNUAL REVENUE RECEIVED FROM CALIFORNIA STUDENTS- ATTENDING THOSE. INSTITUTIONS I'M SO THAT. HE IN ANOTHER. IF THEY UPON HOW IT WILL. WILL LARGELY WEEK- THAT IT NOT LIKE ANY OTHER. BORDER WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF CAN AFFAIRS THIS IS A SLUSH- THE TARGET THAT WORD WHAT. I AM IF IT NOT ALL THAT PREDICTABLE THOUGH WE DO TO PRINT. AND REGARDING THE EVEN SEVEN EIGHT WE HAD. THAT BUT THE AMOUNT OF. THAT WE THOUGHT GOING TO HAPPEN. AND BASED ON SCHOOL. BECAUSE IT HAPPENED GOTTEN IS. BY THE LOCAL. AND ANNUAL FEE IS PER OF OUR- FACE ON. CLOSURES AND BASED ON OTHER AGAINST HAPPEN. ON WE WORK ABLE TO THAT. REVENUES WE THOUGHT IN ONE OF YEAR I THINK BY A LITTLE BIT OVER NOW. DOLLAR SO THE REVENUE AND OF ITSELF- BUT- WAY IT IT GATHERED IS. AN AND IF YOU COULD SAID DEFINITELY TO LOOK AT- SO THE ONLY REVENUE FOR. THAT'S KIND OF WHERE WE NEED. ON THAT SIDE ON THE- SIDE HAD BEEN SEVERAL. THAT HAVE CHANGED WITH THIS BUREAU OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS- I DO WANT TO STAY THAT YOU. THOUGH IN THAT THE SENATE EIGHTEEN ALL THAT WE- ONE THE- ONLY AMOUNT WHAT ANNUAL FEE- I BELIEVE IN MAKING OTHER. CELL THERE WITH THAT BACK IN ALL OF THE OTHER PIECE BACK THOUSAND ELEVEN. WHEN THEY WERE. WERE INCREASE I'M- SO IT'S A WORKING AGO THAT ALL OF THE- HAVE BEEN LOOKED AT AND I CAN. FOR INCREASE. THAT PREMIUM SAID A LOT OF THINGS HAPPENED WITH. OVER THE LAST YEARS BUT ACTUALLY WITH AND LAST. THIS CALL LAST EVERY WITH THE ZERO. THE FIRST THING THAT ALL WE'RE GOOD GIRLS I UNDER CA ALL OF THE STATE IS IT. UNDER THE SAME. THE WE HAVE AND THAT THAT THE LAST SEVERAL. I HAVE BEEN SET SEVERAL. EMPLOYEES PACKAGE THAT HAVE FOR. SO FOR EXAMPLE IN OFFICE. NAY OR A ASSOCIATE AND- BACKING TO THOUSAND THIRTY. WHAT THEY WERE MAKING FROM COULD. IT. THEY ALL INCREASE- SIGNIFICANTLY THAT 30% AND OTHER- OTHER TYPES OF- THE STAFF IT'S EVEN A LARGER PERCENTAGE SO. THAT'S ONE THING WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE. THE OTHER THING WITH IT. IT'S NANCY TWELVE THIRTEEN TIME FRAME AS THEY STARTED IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN THEY ACTUALLY INCREASE THEIR STAFF BY SIGNIFICANTLY SO THEY HAD. I'M FORTY. SEVEN NEW STAFF IS SIMPLE LAST NIGHT THAT THERE WERE TWENTY SEVEN NAY STAFF INVOLVED. IN EVERY TWENTY EIGHT WHAT. ARE NOW ON SALE STAFF SEVENTEEN OF THEM WINNING TWO ONE FOURTH SO THAT'S- THAT THEY PROVIDE. COULD IMPROVED. ON IN ADDITION WITH THE- A DIFFERENT UP OLD. THAT IT ADDED ANOTHER STEP ELEVEN AND IF YOU THE WITH PC THAT WENT. ALL THOSE INCREASE SIGNAL. THERE'S ALSO THE COST AND WHEN YOU HAD INCREASES AND THAT IT DOESN'T INTO THE BUREAU STAFF. IN THAT THE ALL OF THE STATE. SO DEEPLY AND THINK WHY PROGRAM IN FOR. THAT WOULD A SIGNIFICANT. FOR THEM AS WELL AS THE- GENERAL. HAS GONE UP AGAIN ALL. BACK TO THE- FEELINGS THAT. WELL ALL OF THOSE THINGS THAT IMPACTED THIS YEAR. AND THEN THE LAST THING IMPACT WITH THEM REALLY IT'S IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NEW I KEEP. THAT WAS ANOTHER THING THAT IN THAT. ALL OF THAT WE IN A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE AMOUNT OF THEIR X. AND LOT OF IT IS OF THEIR- WHAT HAVE THEY DONE BABY WILL AT. THAT ARE IN WHAT WE THEIR. AND SOME OF THOSE THINGS IN. THAT THEY'D LOOK AT IT THEY SAY AND ACT HAD TO LOOK AT BECAUSE THE COLD IN MY- WHAT ARE. COSTS WHERE CAN FIND THE- WITH. WITH ME IN A- AND WITH THE POPE SOUTH HAVE THE WORD GOING MORE ONLINE THEREFORE WE CAN FIND. AND ALL LOOKING OTHER. THE OTHER THING AND IT IT WON'T HAPPEN QUICKLY BECAUSE THEY JUST RECENTLY BUT IN THE FUTURE LET'S LOOK AT BOTH WE- WORK BUT- NOBODY CLAPPED BECAUSE NOW WITH HOMEWORK I THINK WE CAN CUT DOWN ON OUR OUR PHYSICAL. TO WHERE WE CAN ACTUALLY HAVE A LOWER RENT ALL OF THESE THINGS ARE WHAT THEY'RE LOOKING AT. THINGS THAT ARE UNDER THEIR CONTROL THE SALARIES AND OTHER ENTITIES INCREASING FAT IT'S NOT AND SO THAT'S WHY IT FITS POINT THERE IS THAT NEEDED BE INCREASE TO BASIC CONTINUE TO FALL BEFORE THAT. SO I COULD APPLY UP I GUESS I HEARING. THERE'S MANY THINGS THAT ARE. ADAM AN OUT OF THE CAN. OF THESE AND SEE- AND I'M OF THE BUREAU THE BUT THE BUREAU SEEING THE NEED TO FOR MORE REVENUES OF THE RAISING FEES BUT THEN. WHAT THE INSTITUTIONS CAN CONTROL IS VERY LIMITED. AND SO I GUESS YOU KNOW. UP I CAN SEE LIKE A FOR EXAMPLE I HAVE HEARD THAT A- NOW BRANDON MAX BRAND TO BE CAMPUS CAMPUS V. IN TWENTY SIXTEEN WITH A THOUSAND DOLLARS. AND THEN TWENTY SEVENTEEN IT BECAME SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLARS AND THEN THE OTHER THIS PROPOSAL IT'S LIKE A HUNDRED FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS. SO AND I GUESS WHAT I DIDN'T HEAR I GUESS IS IT HOW IS IT THAT YOU DO YOU. ARE YOU. TO THE IN. CAT THAT CURRENTLY EXIST AMERICA IS AN INSTANCE GONNA PAY. ONE POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS TO TRY TO STAY FOR. MAKE THE STATE THAT TO BE ABLE TO OPERATE. WE HAVE MADE SOME OF CAP MISREPORTING AYE AYE HAVE HER TALK TO BUT THE CHAIN IN THAT THE- BUT WHAT WE GET IS THE RECOMMENDED. THAT IN- THE- STUDY THOUGH WORK OR RECOMMENDATION THAT OUT THIRD IN. ACTUALLY LOOK AT AND PROVIDE. AND SO THAT THE DATA SOMETHING THEY- WOULD MAKE IN AND LOOKED AT THAT MONEY THAT IS NEEDED HE SAID ZERO TOLERANCE. ON THAT'S WHAT THEY WERE PROPOSED AN SELF WE HELP YOU. CAN WE'RE AT RAY FELLOW ARMS THAT IS THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT NOT IT'S READY BREK ATTY BECAUSE THAT- CAP ON ON THAT I KNOW YOU POOR ANNUAL INFORMATION. WELL I THINK A TO GO AHEAD THE EMIR OF GOING. I THANK- FIFTEEN KERN CAP IS SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLARS OR AT EACH. LOCATION WHETHER IT BE THE MAIN THE PRICE AND THEN THE- PREVIOUSLY THERE WERE THOUSAND WOULD FOR EACH. WITH EIGHT. AT EMAIL. WHAT THEY DID THEN IN THE- FEE INCREASES WAY TREATED EACH FOR HAS AS ITS OWN REVENUES. AND HIT THE MINIMUM AND CAP ON THAT SPECIFIC BRANCH. AND WE GOT LOT FOR TO PARTNERING WHEN THE LEGISLATORS AND BOND AND OUT OF OUR FEES- APPROACH TO FIFTY. SO I AM I THAT CARE FOR I MEAN I- I'M SO CONCERNED A THESE BEING. ESPECIALLY I MEAN AS A AS A LEAD TO THERE WERE THE CENTER VALLEY- YOU NO MATTER ACCESS EDUCATE ACCESS VERY VERY. AND I'LL AT LEAST INSTEAD PROVIDE THAT PATH AS I SAY EARLIER INDECENCY ALSO OTHER TO SAID TO BE IRAN TO THE B. THAT THE- THE B. T. THERE WERE NO. YOU KNOW SHOULD LOOK AT THIS IN A BAD. BECAUSE WERE WERE WERE LATER FIELD FEET OF BEING. AND- THAT'S GOING TO HAVE A LOT OF AND I CONTACT AND I WOULD JUST SAY. NOW THE- OF YOU KNOW THAT PERCENT AS OF YOUR REVENUE OF YOU OPERATING IS TO IS REVENUE- I'M NOT SURE RACES ANNABLE. AND I THINK THAT- I'M SEEING A RECIPE FOR DISASTER WE HAVE. THE LEGISLATURE WHO IS. BLARING ON MORE. ON THIS ON THIS. WE HAVE AN ANTIQUATED COMPUTER SYSTEM THAT NEEDS TO BE. ADDRESSED AND WE HAVE NOW FEWER SCHOOLS THAT ARE NOW GOING TO SEE A MASSIVE FEE INCREASE- THAT'S JUST NOT A SUSTAINABLE MODEL. AND I JUST ENCOURAGE THEM YOU KNOW THE COMMITTEES INVOLVED IN ALL OF US TO LOOK AT THAT VERY. VERY CLOSELY- BECAUSE WHEN WE TALK ABOUT SUSTAINABILITY ONLY TALK ABOUT. HIS INSTITUTIONS WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO LOOK AT THAT THANKS VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH A SIMILAR FONG IT JUST DIDN'T TO THAT POINT- TO. AADHAR DCA DIRECTOR ON PAGE EIGHTEEN. OF THE SUNSET REVIEW PAPER LIST THE CATEGORIES OF THE CURRENT pINCREASE. IN FACT I HAD TO GO TO ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE STAFF BECAUSE I THOUGHT THE MATH WAS INCORRECT- BUT FOR EXAMPLE- ON THAT'S FROMTHE TOP. FIVE DOWN ON FOR THE APPLICATION FOR APPROVAL TO OPERATE BY MEANS OF ACCREDITATION. THE CURRENT FEE IS SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS THE NEW FEE IS TEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS. A ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED AND 9% INCREASE. AGAIN I THOUGHT THAT THAT NUMBER WAS WAS INCORRECT BUT I WAS TOLD THAT THAT'S- THAT IT WAS FACTUAL OR IT TO SEE BELOW THAT A SEVEN HUNDRED AND 17% INCREASE. OR EVEN LOWER THE FIVE HUNDRED AND 11% INCREASE AS I THINK YOU YOU'D BE HEARING BECAUSE WE HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF YOUR TIME AS DCA DIRECTOR YOU'RE HEARING NOT ONLY FOR BP. BUT ALSO FOR A NUMBER OF OTHER ENTITIES THAT ARE. THE REAL CONCERN ABOUT THESE FEE INCREASES ESPECIALLY TIMES OF THE COVERT PANDEMIC THAT WE FEEL LIKE THAT MIGHT BE SOME- THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES. THAT MIGHT BE A LITTLE TONE DEAF- SO WE WELCOME IN AND SOME OF THE OTHER REMARKS AS WELL TOO BUT WE'LL GO WITH AND THEN TO THE NEXT- PERSON WHICH IS ASSEMBLY WOMAN VOLUNTEERS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. SO MY QUESTION IS- AROUND EXEMPTIONS FOR RELIGIOUS INSTITUTIONS AND- THE RECOMMENDATION FROM THE B. PP. THAT WE'D CHANGE LANGUAGE TO SPECIAL SPECIFIED THAT MORE OF AND THEN FIFTY PERCENT- IS FOCUSED ON RELIGIOUS THE RELIGIOUS PRINCIPLE OF THAT RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATION. CAN YOU EXPLAIN OR CLARIFY AS TO WHY YOU MADE THE RECOMMENDATION AND- GIVE ANY SPECIFIC EXAMPLES. ON THAT LED TO THAT WHY. YES I'M ACTUALLY GOING TO HAVE MEANT THREE FATTY- BAKER THAT THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING THANK YOU. A HAS BEAN AND MANY. APPLICATIONS COMING THROUGH FOR A VERIFICATION OF RELIGIOUS EXEMPTION WHERE THE ACTUAL PROGRAMS AREN'T CLEARLY OUTLINED AS BEING RELIGIOUS IN NATURE AND MORE- EITHER BUSINESS. A LOT OF- MBAS ERICA SAYS THAT WE'VE- IS THEREFORE EIGHT. WE'RE LOOKING AT SOMETHING THAT WILL PROVIDE AS MORE GUIDANCE ON AND ENSURING THAT THERE TRULY MEETING THE LEGISLATORS INTENT WHAT THE EXEMPTION. AND AGAIN MY CONCERN HERE IS ONE IS SAID THERE'S ALREADY OVERSIGHT FROM THE BUREAU AS YOU WOULD YOU AND DO YOU CURRENTLY NOT APPROVE OR DO YOU HAVE TO APPROVED BECAUSE OF EXISTING LANGUAGE. SO WE CURRENTLY APPROVED. ADDING TO THE EXISTING LANGUAGE IT'S JUST NOT- HERE TO FEEL THAT IT COULD BE A CLEARER EXEMPTION THAT WOULD- PROVIDE A COLLAPSE OF THE DISCRETIONARY IN THAT SITUATION. AND IS IT GOING TO REQUIRE ANY ADDITIONAL RESOURCES FOR YOU TO- AND FORCE THIS. YEAH WE DO NOT WE DON'T REQUIRE ANY ADDITIONAL RESOURCES FOR R&amp;D- AND PROCESSING THESE APPLICATIONS AND IF WE AND THEN IT MAY ACTUALLY WEAPONS SOME OF THE COMPLEXITY THAT WE DO HAVE WITH IT WHEN WE'RE UNABLE TO VERIFY AN EXEMPTION AND- HAVING TO. GO BACK AND FORTH EITHER THROUGH THE ADMINISTRATIVE LAW PROCESS OR WHAT HAVE YOU. SO WOULD YOU ANTICIPATE APPEALS OR IS THERE AN EXISTING WILL THERE BE. IS THERE AN EXISTING APPEAL PROCESS OR WILL THERE BE OPPORTUNITY APPEAL. THERE IS AN EXISTING ECHO PROCESS AND WE BELIEVE THAT IF THE LAW IS CLEAR THAT WE WOULD BE LEFT THE FIELD. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR GLAZER FOLLOWED BY CHAIRMAN DID. THANK YOU I'D TO THE CHAIRS IN THE COMMITTEES FOR SOMEONE IN THIS YEAR AND CAN CAN YOU HEAR ME. YES. OKAY TERRIFIC- IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN- THIS E. AT THE ASSEMBLY PUT FORWARD A COMPREHENSIVE PACKAGE OF BILLS- PRIVATE POST SECONDARY EDUCATION THAT WERE HEARD IN THE SENATE BUSINESS PROFESSIONS COMMITTEE. I THAT WE PASSED A NUMBER OF THOSE BILLS. A NUMBER OF BILLS ARE ALSO AMENDED WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT WE- WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THIS SUNSET REVIEW THAT IS TAKING PLACE NOW A YEAR. LATER THAT IT WAS EXPECTED AND THAT SOME OF THE MORE DEEPER ISSUES THAT THOSE THAT THAT LEGISLATION RAISED WOULD BE BEST HANDLED THROUGH THAT- SUNSET REVIEW. SO I WANT TO THANK AT YOUR LOW INSURE ROCK. AFTER THEIR WILLINGNESS TO DIG MUCH MORE DEEPLY INTO THIS ZERO- AND THAT THE PERFORMANCE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT THEY HAVE FACED- IT'S VERY MUCH APPRECIATED. BUT I WANT TO LET IT KNOWLEDGE AT LEAST ONE OF THE CORE ISSUES THAT WAS RAISED. DURING THAT THAT THAT THOSE HEARINGS AND THAT'S THE ISSUE OF COST THE COST TO STUDENTS- AND OF VALUE TO STUDENTS. AND THOUGH THE CONCERN THAT THAT WASN'T MATCHING UP IN THE WAY THAT IT SHOULD. AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT. MANY OF THE PROGRAMS PROVIDED BY THESE PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS AND BY THE WAY MANY OF THEM ARE OPERATING WITH HIGH INTEGRITY AND EFFECTIVENESS. BUT MANY OF THE PROGRAMS PROVIDED BY THESE PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS COULD BE PROVIDED BY PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS RIGHT NOW. WE HAVE OVER A HUNDRED AND FORTY. COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES IN OUR STATE. WITH THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF PROGRAMS AND HUNDREDS OF DEGREE OPPORTUNITIES. BUT UNFORTUNATELY IT'S STILL NOT SERVING THE GREATER CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY. SO I WANTED TO USE THIS OPPORTUNITY WITH CHAIR MEDINA AND SURE LEYVA PRESENT AS WELL TO HIGHLIGHT THE FACT THAT WE SHOULD BE LOOKING MORE DEEPLY INTO THESE GAPS THAT ARE OUT THERE THAT THE PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS ARE- BILLING. AND SOME WITH MANY MANY WONDERFUL PROGRAMS BUT WE COULD LOWER THE COST AND INCREASE THE VALUE QUOTIENT. OF OUR PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS WERE ENGAGED. I AM FILLING SOME OF THESE GAPS THAT THE STUDENTS CLEARLY WANT OUR ECONOMY NEEDS SO I WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT THAT THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY GIVE YOU. MY COMMENTS AND TO SHARE THAT PERSPECTIVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH CENTER GLAZER. CHAIRMAN TINA. THANK YOU I HAD SEVERAL QUESTIONS- IN IN THE AREA OF. DISTANCE EDUCATION OUR FIRST QUESTION HOW CAN THE BUREAU INSURE THAT CALIFORNIA'S STUDENTS ARE PROTECTED WHEN THEY'RE ATTENDING INSTITUTIONS THAT MAY NOT MEET THE REQUIREMENTS FOR A PHYSICAL PRESENCE THAT WOULD TRIGGER GIRLS OVERSIGHT. AND I AM AN ADMINISTRATOR FREDDIE TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION THANK YOU. THANK YOU CURRENTLY REQUIRES OUT OF STATE INSTITUTIONS ARE OFFERING SECONDARY EDUCATION THROUGH DISTANCE EDUCATION TO CALIFORNIA'S DIDN'T. TO REGISTER WITH THE BUREAU AND WITH THAT REGISTRATION THEY HAVE TO HAVE AN APPROVAL AND ARE HOME STATE AND BE ACCREDITED BY AN ACCREDITING BODY THAT'S RECOGNIZED BY THE U. S. FUNDED EDUCATION. ZERO ENSURE THAT THE OTHER STATE ENTITIES AND YOUR CREDITORS ARE HOLDING THOSE INSTITUTIONS TO THEIR STANDARDS AND IF A COMPLAINT IS RECEIVED WE INVESTIGATED AND WORK WITH THOSE ENTITIES TO FOLLOW UP INTO AND HELP IT DIDN'T COME TO A RESOLUTION. AND I JUST LIKE TO ADD ON THE FACT THAT I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS AN AREA AS WE REQUESTED THIS YEAR THAT WE'RE HAPPY TO DISCUSS WITH THE LEGISLATURE AN INDETERMINATE THERE'S ANY- THING NEEDED TO STRENGTHEN THAT PROCESS AS WELL. THANK YOU THANK YOU THAT ANSWER- RECENTLY I WAS- MADE AWARE. OF ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY. THAT HAS A CENTER OF PHYSICAL CENTER. IN DOWNTOWN LA- WHAT ROLE DOES THE BUREAU HAVE IN REGULATING PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS LIKE ARIZONA STATE THAT HAVE A PHYSICAL PRESENCE. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND ARE OFFERING CLASSES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WITH A PHYSICAL PRESENCE. AT THE ATLANTA THAT MEASURE BUT IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO ADD TO WEEK WE'RE AWARE THAT SOME OF THOSE OUT OF STATE UNIVERSITY THAT WE ARE PLANNING OR HAVE RECENTLY OPENED- PHYSICAL CAMPUSES IN CALIFORNIA- BUT BECAUSE BPP IAN REGULATIONS THAT THEY REGULATE PRIVATE POSTSECONDARY EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THE ISSUE CURRENTLY FALLS UNDER THE JURISDICTION- HOWEVER AGAIN TO FIND THAT MY EARLIER COMMENT WE REALLY LOOK FORWARD TO ENCOURAGING- ENGAGING WITH THE LEGISLATURE. AND THE ADMINISTRATION AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS ON THAT ISSUE AND A CREDIT YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO ADD AND THAT BASICALLY COVERED FANTASY HE. SAID ZERO IS. I MEAN BY THAT. TO RISE. PRIVATE SECONDARY EDUCATIONAL. THEREFORE WE DON'T HAVE THE ANSWER TO WRITE. PUBLIC INSTITUTION. THANK YOU N. AND YOUR YOUR IS GOING IN THE DIRECTION OF MY NEXT COUPLE OF QUESTIONS SO BECAUSE WE HAVE INSTITUTIONS LIKE- FORMER BRIDGE POINT. RUNNING THE UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA GLOBAL CAMPUS OR KAPLAN BECOMING PURDUE GLOBAL. AND SO THIS SEEMS TO BE A TREND. OF THE. NOT FOR PROFIT- HIGHER LEARNING INSTITUTIONS ACTING LIKE FOR PROFIT- HIGHER LEARNING. AND SO AND SO- AGAIN IS THIS A CONCERN OF THE BUREAU AND- IS THIS A CONCERN. YES DEFINITELY IT IS SOMETHING THAT WE WANT TO LOOK AT AND AGAIN- WE BELIEVE THAT WOULD PROBABLY POTENTIALLY BE NEEDED LEGISLATION IN THE FUTURE SO AGAIN THAT'S WHERE WE REALLY WANT TO PARTNER WITH YOU AND LOOK AT THAT. PROCESS SO THERE ARE A- POTENTIAL AT LOOPHOLES IN THE LAW THE PERHAPS NEED TO BE ADDRESSED. YES YES PEOPLE LEAVE THAT IT'S DEFINITELY SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO LOOK INTO. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. CHILUBA THANK YOU CHAIR OKAY THANK YOU TO MY COLLEAGUES TO ANSWER AFTER MOST OF MY QUESTIONS WHICH IS GREAT WE'RE ALL ON THE SAME PAGE I DO HAVE OF. ADDITIONAL QUESTION WHEN IT COMES TO ACCREDITATION. AND I JUST LOST IT. AND SORRY IF THE MINIMUM OPERATING STANDARDS I WANT TO ASK ABOUT OUR THE CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN THE ACT THAT ALLOWED INSTITUTION TO BECOME A LICENSED STRONG ENOUGH TO PROTECT STUDENTS AND PROMOTE STUDENT SUCCESS SO ARE THE STANDARD STRONG ENOUGH. SO I'LL START THAT AN ANSWER AND THEN I YOU MAKE AT THE OPTIMIST OR FREDDIE TO ADD ANYTHING HE HAS ADDED WELL. AS YOU CAN SEE IN OUR BACK PAPER- WE DO HAVE ITEMS THAT WE BELIEVE COULD HELP THE BUREAU- IN ITS MINIMUM OPERATING STANDARDS AND SOME RECOMMENDATIONS THAT ARE IN THAT ACTUAL- THE SUGGESTION. AND THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS WE COVERED IN THAT SO WE DEFINITELY BELIEVE THAT THIS IS THE ROOM WHERE AT PLACE WHERE THERE IS ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT AND ROOM FOR ACCEPTANCE FROM THE LEGISLATURE AND I CAN HAVE THAT FOR FREDDIE BECAUSE THAT SPECIFICALLY. AS TO WHAT THOSE ARE. THANK YOU DIRECT. AND ZERO RECOMMEND THAT WE HAVE THAT WERE PROVIDED THE AUTHORITY TO STRENGTHEN OUR MINIMUM OPERATING STANDARDS AROUND AND EAT THE CHARGES THAT THE EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS ARE CHARGING THE STUDENTS IN THE DOESN'T MAKE SENSE IS IT IN LINE WITH THE CURRENT CHARGES AND OTHER- OTHER INSTITUTIONS I JUST DIDN'T PAINT TO MATCH HER. IN IN ONE AREA. ADDITIONALLY- WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS THAT ENROLL INTO A PROGRAM IS APPROPRIATE IS THERE ENOUGH EQUIPMENT IS THERE ARE ENOUGH TEACHERS AND SO FORTH TO ENSURE THAT THOSE STUDENTS ARE GONNA GET THE OUTCOME THAT THEY'RE PAYING FOR. AND THE OTHER SECTION IS THAT THE EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS ARE BEING EVALUATED FOR THEIR EFFECTIVENESS. WE I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE READER AND THE PROGRAM IS SUFFICIENT- YOU KNOW WE HAVE THE SCHOOL DEPARTMENT FACT SHEET THAT THE SCHOOLS ARE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE YET THERE'S NO STANDARDS FOR THOSE DIFFERENT TACK SHEET- COMPLETION RATE GRADUATION RATE- PLACEMENT RATE OR- EXAMINATION RIGHT. SO THOSE ARE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT WE'RE THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT THAT WOULD HELP THAT STRENGTHENS THE EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM. ANY BUT I THOUGHT REGULATIONS THAT MAY BE NEEDED TO MAKE CHANGES IN THE APARTMENT AND OPERATE YEAH WELL. THANK YOU WELL ANY WE CAN DO BECAUSE ALL THE THINGS THAT WERE MENTIONED I THINK- INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT MAKING SURE STUDENTS HAVE ACCESS WHEN THEY ENROLL IN THE HAVE ALL OF THE- UNNECESSARY ITEMS TO BE SUCCESSFUL. AND I JUST WANTED TO ALSO COMMENT ON SENATOR GLAZERS COMMENTS- I DO AGREE THAT MANY OF OUR INSTITUTIONS ESPECIALLY OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES COULD FILL SOME OF THE GAPS THAT WE SEE WITH OUR POST PRIVATE SECONDARY INSTITUTIONS- MYSELF SHARE MEDINA HAVE DONE A LOT OF WORK ON OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES. AND I THINK THAT WE CAN DO EVEN MORE WORK TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT HAPPENS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH CHAIR LEYVA. WELL THEN GO TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER GIPSON FOLLOWED BY CHAIR ROTH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH YOUR GROUP THIS QUESTION MAY HAVE ALREADY BEEN ASKED OR ANSWERED ALREADY BUT PLEASE INDULGE ME. DO YOU THINK THAT THE DO YOU FEEL THAT THE FEE INCREASE- IS- NEEDED TO KEEP THE BUREAU SOLVENT. YEAH DEFINITELY ED AT THAT POINT IN TIME- YEAH THAT'S NOT LIKE OTHER A STRUCTURAL IMBALANCE. BETWEEN ART. AND BUDGET YOU KNOW I'M JUST PART OF IT HERE ARE. WE ARE ACTUALLY TALKING THE EIGHT THANK FOURTEEN LONG IN ORDER STATE CRICKET HERE I AWHILE BACK BONUS HELPFUL WHAT IT DOES DO THAT DRIVES UP A CAR. OF THAT THE INCREASE FOR THAT YEAR I'M- WE OPPOSED COULD IT THEIR LAP YEAR WITH THE- SENT THAT WE PROCESS AND TWENTY- THAT COULD BE PUT IT DOWN ON THE AND SO HAD TO THAT THAT. IF YOU'RE IN THAT LOW WAS NOT. I'M IN ORDER FOR THE- WE FALL AND THAT YEAR AND IT WILL COULD HE AND I. YEARS IF DO NOT I'M FINE I'M DISCUSSION WHERE WE CAN HAVE WITH YOU WITH THAT A- OF A THEY CALL TO WEAR WE CAN. A FULL TO THE PROBLEM. WELL ONE OF THE DIFFERENT DO THERE'S NO QUESTION MISTER CHAIRMAN- HAVE ANY ALL LINE I'M SO. LOS ACCRUE. DURING THE- I DON'T MISTER FREDDIE WILL HAVE I DON'T I'M NOT WE MAY TO GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT QUESTION. WE THANK YOU HAVE A YEAH I WOULD DEFINITELY HAVE TO GET BACK ON THAT- QUESTION I DON'T KNOW WITH ANY OPETH MY HEAD THAT HAVE ACTUALLY LOST THEIR CREDIT ASIAN- I BELIEVE WE'VE HAD A COUPLE. AND INSTITUTIONS THAT WERE NOT DISCLOSED EDUCATION O'CLOCK THEIR CREDIT ASIAN DURING THE TIME. THAT WE HAVE MICHAEL HAD BELIEVE IN AND YOU CAN CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG BUT I BELIEVE WE HAD PEOPLE THAT HAVE ACTUALLY CLOSED SO- DURING THE PANDEMIC LIKE PERMANENTLY CLOSED OTHERS HUNDRED RECALLS THAT EVERYONE CAN'T FIFTY SCHOOL BOARD NINE PEOPLE THE HAD TO CLOSE. I THINK IN PART IT WAS BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC BUT THEN ALSO SOME OF THE WILL BUT MENTIONS THAT THEY ACTUALLY- WE'RE WE'RE LOOKING AT CLOSING ANYWAY THEY HAD OTHER ISSUES COME UP AND THAT'S THE KIND OF WHAT THAT THE LAUGH- HE SAID THAT THE PUZZLE THAT PUTS THEM OVER THE EDGE. WHEN SOME OF THOSE SCHOOLS A DECIDED TO CLOSE FOR OTHER REASONS OTHER THAN A PANDEMIC- HOW HAVE THOSE HAVE THOSE STUDENTS BEEN. HOW THOSE STUDENTS HOW'S THAT BEING HANDLED WITH THE WHAT IT COMES DOWN TO THOSE SCHOOLS CLOSING AND THOSE STUDENTS. THAT MAY HAVE LOANS THERE AND OR- CLASSES BECAUSE I CAN REMEMBER. THAT WE HAD ONE UNIVERSITY THAT CLOSED DOWN AND STUDENTS WERE ADVERSELY- AFFECTED AND IN THE LEGISLATURE HAD TO STEP IN TO TRY TO ASSIST IN- CREDITS IN CLASSES THE WHOLE NINE YARDS SO- DO YOU HAVE ANY. RESPONSE TO THAT QUESTION. WE DEFINITELY NOT HAVE HANDLING THAT OFF YOU MISTER BELL BIRTHDAY OUR- TARGET. FOCAL FOR THIS IN. AND THEY HAVE- BEEN A SHINING. WITH THE BUREAU WITH WHAT HAVE DONE FUNDING THEY CAN. THANK YOU DIRECTOR KERR PRIOR THANK YOU FOR QUESTION- YES WE- TAKING VERY- APPROACH TO. OUR AVERAGE EFFORTS AROUND. NOT SCHOOL CLOSURES PROJECT DURIG THE TIME- OF THE KOBE CRISIS. A STARTING AT THE- NOT MANY SCHOOL HAVE I KNOW. THE OF THEIR TEMPORARY. CLOSURE WITHIN YOU CAN.

MAKE WITH THE STUDENT- IF YOU WERE. IN A VIRTUAL IN MY- IF THAT. THEN WE WILL PARTNER WITH THE US DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND THEIR OUTREACH TEAM TO SORT OF APPROPRIATE TO STUDENTS WHAT THEIR OPTIONS ARE. OFTEN OTHER SCHOOLS ARE INVOLVED AS WELL AT THE OFFICE AND WE'RE PROGRAM IN OUR OFFERINGS EITHER DO A TEACH OUT OR TAKE THOSE STUDENTS YOU NEED TO TRANSFER- WE SERVE AS SORT OF A LIAISON. YOU NAVIGATE THAT AS WELL- OR IN THE WORST CASE SCENARIO YOU KNOW WHERE THEY WERE OUT OF POCKET- AND ECONOMIC BASED ON OUT OF POCKET PAYMENTS TO THE SCHOOL AND WE CONNECT THEM WITH THE STUDENT TUITION RECOVERY FUND. AND LOOK FOR THE BALLET- SO YES WE'RE DEFINITELY HELP YOU THE FUTURE AND IF I CAN'T TAKE A MINUTE TO GO BACK TO. GET ALLOW ME TO SPEAK TO SENATOR GLAZERS COMMENTS ABOUT- TO COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND OTHER OPTIONS FOR STUDENTS AS WELL.

AND WE'RE MEETING WITH PROSPECTIVE STUDENTS.PART OF OUR CHARGE IF YOU- AT THE STUDENTS WITH ALL OPTIONS ARE RELATED TO WHAT THEY ARE- EDUCATIONAL VOCATIONAL GOALS ARE- INCLUDING OUR PUBLIC OP OPTION IN NONPROFIT EXAM SCHOOLS ETCETERA AND WE GO THROUGH IN DETAIL. WITH OUR CONTENT TO SORT OF TALK ABOUT THOSE OPTIONS AS WELL AS VALID OPTION FELT. ALL THE MATH MESSAGING. THROUGH OUR OUTREACH EFFORTS AS WELL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH J. FOLLOWED BY SOME WOMEN GRAYSON. THANK YOU- JERRY YOU KNOW I'M SORT OF NEW TO THIS- BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS CAN AND THE BUREAU POST SECONDARY EDUCATION. OBVIOUSLY FROM WHAT I'VE READ AND WHAT I'VE BEEN HEARING YOUR MISSION IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT TO STUDENTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- BUT GIVEN THE VARIOUS ISSUES THAT WERE IDENTIFIED IN OUR- BACKGROUND PAPER I'M I'M JUST CURIOUS WHAT WHAT DO YOU CONSIDER TO BE YOUR- CORE MISSION. AS A BUREAU. THE COURT MENTIONED THAT THIS IT IT PROTECTION BY THE WAY I'VE BEEN HAVING TROUBLE HEARING YOU MA'AM AND I'M PROBABLY THE OLDEST GUY IN THIS ROOM BY FAR BY FAR AND- IT'S OBVIOUSLY A TESTAMENT TO MY AGE AND THE QUALITY OF MY YEARS. WHICH OBVIOUSLY IS FOR BUT IF YOU WOULD SPEAK SLOWER AND A LITTLE LOUDER. THAT WOULD HELP ME. I AM SORRY ABOUT THAT SENATOR RAP. ON IT IS STUDENT PROTECTION THAT IS THE CORE MISSION OF THE BUREAU FOR PRIVATE POSTSECONDARY EDUCATION. OKAY WELL YOU KNOW IN LOOKING THROUGH THE MATERIAL IT'S PRETTY CLEAR TO ME THAT THE- SPAN OF CONTROL OF THE BUREAU IS PRETTY WIDE. AND GIVEN THE FACT THAT YOU COVER EVERYTHING FROM FOUR YEAR DEGREE GRANTING INSTITUTIONS TO. OF SCHOOLS AND PROGRAMS THAT AWARD LICENSES AND CERTIFICATES AT THE END OF THE COURSE OR A SERIES OF COURSES- IS THIS. THE WAY WE STRUCTURED THE BUREAU- ONE STILL FEASIBLE. AND TO IF I CAN ASK YOU QUESTIONS AT THE SAME TIME HOW DO YOU PRIORITIZE YOUR EFFORTS GIVING GIVEN THE FACT THAT THERE ARE TREMENDOUS DIFFERENCES IN THE PROGRAMS THAT YOU OVERSEE. HI I'M GONNA START OUT HERE AND I BELIEVE I'M GONNA KICK THE TOP TWO BIT BUT PROBABLY BOTH METRIC AND- IT'S ABOUT FORTY PER RESPONSE. FIRST OF ALL IS THAT FEASIBLE- AND AS YOU PROBABLY KNOW IN THAT THE BACKGROUND PAPER AND THE INFORMATION THAT'S BEEN PROVIDED WHEN WE DID THAT THE STUDY ONE THING THAT WE LOOKED AT IT. IS NOT FEASIBLE TRULY A TO CONTINUE THE WAY WE'RE DOING IN THE WAY WE HAVE TO EXPORT THAT THE GIRL STRUCTURE- AND SO THAT'S WHY I'M ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE THINKING ABOUT DEPENDING ON WHAT OUR DISCUSSION'S THOUGH I'M THIS YEAR IS. POTENTIALLY LOOKING AT AN ECONOMIST COME IN AND IDENTIFY IF THAT'S THE APPROPRIATE WAY TO BE- PERFORMING BUT SERVICES THAT THE BUREAU AND CHARGING INDIVIDUALS I'M TO BE ABLE TO OBTAIN REVENUE ALSO. THAT THAT'S IN RESPONSE TO YOUR QUESTION FOR FEASIBILITY BUT ONE THING I WANTED THAT DISCONTENT SUSPECT AT DESKTOP BEFORE I PASS IT OFF TO- LIZA AND MR ALREADY AT THAT TRULY IN LOOKING AT THAT. THEY ARE VERY DIFFERENT THAN OTHER BOROUGHS AND BOARD WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS ON THE WAY THEY'RE STRUCTURED. AND EVERYTHING PRETTY MUCH ABOUT THEM IS VERY DIFFERENT BECAUSE AGAIN WHEN OF THAT BORDER BUREAU WHOSE LICENSING AN INDIVIDUAL WHEN THEY'RE LOOKING AT HOW DO I PROTECT THE CONSUMERS ARE LOOKING AT THE INDIVIDUAL COMING AND IDENTIFYING HAS THIS INDIVIDUAL MET ALL OF THE REQUIREMENTS- AND SO THAT'S WHAT HEY'RE LOOKING AT. BETTER BASICALLY CHECKING THE BOX MAKING SURE THAT IT MEETS EACH PIECE OF WATER EACH PIECE OF WATER REGULATION TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT INDIVIDUAL CAN PRACTICE AND IN IT. LET ME GET THIS INDIVIDUAL LICENSES QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE ON THE BACK IN WHEN WE TAKE ACTION AGAINST THOSE INDIVIDUALS YEAH LET ME TRY TO IF THIS INDIVIDUAL IS IT IS OFTEN SAID THAT PUBLIC THEN LET'S STOP AND- PRACTICING. BUT IF THEY CAN CONTINUE. THEN LET'S CONTINUE TO BRING THEM ON A DATE COULD REHABILITATE THAT INDIVIDUAL LICENSE PLATE. AT THE WHERE THE BUREAU IS. THEY NEED TO WIN THE BIG. WHEN THEY'RE LOOKING AT THE- AS THEY ARE. BY OF WELL AS REQUIREMENTS THAT THEY REALLY NEED HELP. UP BROADLY THE IS SOMETHING THAT JUST. COME TO OUR- A KIND OF LOOK AT THE OUTSIDE BOX. WE TO BE ABLE TO. GET THOSE IN THE BILL SCHOOL. TO ONLY CHECK THE BOX BUT IT. THE PHILIPPINES THE END OF SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO START GOING. ON OUR NEEDING THEIR CLIMATE IN THERE'S ONE THING THE BILL FOR THE SCHOOL. AND HAD EDUCATION COUNCIL. THAT REVIEW THAT AND THOSE IN THE- THEY DO ADD AN AND NOW. OF REALLY TO. VERY ON THAT TO THAT- PART- ELEMENT IN MISSION OF THE PROGRAM ON THE IN. MAYBE THIS IS SOMETHING WE NEED LOOK AT DISCUSS WITH YOU TO. GENERAL'S TO WEIGH WE CAN ACT I GUESS. ON AND MAKE IT UP I THAT WE TAKING SCHOOL AND IF THEY- COME IN TO COME. THAT WE NEED TO. IT STOP THOSE CALLS GOOD FROM BEING ABLE TO PRACTICE AND TO- HELP THAT. AND WITH THE AS FAR PRODUCT. IN A PATH THAT OPTIMISTS FREDDIE ON BECAUSE I KNOW THEY PRIOR. AND ALL WANTED THE OTHER PRIORITIZATION IS IT HELPING INDIVIDUALS GET THOSE STRIP CLAIMS FILED. WITH BOTH OUR- IT JUST SEEMS TO ME THERE'S A TRUE. DE WHEN YOU TAKING A LOOK AT A- SCHOOL THAT IS A FOUR YEAR HIGHER READ. OPERATION FOR EXAMPLE THAT AWARDS BACCALAUREATE DEGREES. TAKING A LOOK AT THAT AYE OPERATION AND THEN TAKING A LOOK AT THE SCHOOL THAT TRAINS PLUMBERS IN ISSUES OF PLUMBER CERTIFICATE OR AN HVAC CERTIFICATE SOMETHING FOR SOMEONE ELSE. AND IF THE CORE MISSION IS IN IN ESSENCE CONSUMER PROTECTION IN THIS CASE STUDENT CONSUMER PROTECTION THEN YOU HAVE A CORE GROUP OF ISSUES. THAT PERHAPS YOU SHOULD OBVIOUSLY SHOULD BE LOOKING AT BECAUSE SOMEONE NEEDS TO. BUT MAYBE THAT DOESN'T EXTEND TO THE QUALITY OF THE FACULTY OR SOME OF THOSE OTHER ISSUES THAT YOU MENTIONED EARLY EARLIER IN YOUR PRESENTATION SO WHAT WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THAT. THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT IN TERMS OF SPAN OF CONTROL AND BREADTH OF ISSUES. AND WHERE DO YOU FOCUS IN A IN A STATE THAT'S BUDGETARY EARLY CHALLENGED AND YOU DON'T EVEN TAP THE GENERAL FUND. AT THE LAB HAS SET UP AND EVERYBODY TALK ABOUT THAT. STATION THANK YOU DOES THE GIRL HAD AND AS DIRECTOR CHRIS MEYER IT IS FOLKS YOU EDUCATION CONSULTANTS WHO ARE DIVERSE IN THEIR EDUCATION AND THEIR EXPERIENCE IN WORKING- IN REVIEWING AND THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF PROGRAMS THE DEGREE PROGRAM FIRST WITH THE VOCATIONAL PROGRAM AND- AND ALSO WORKING WITH OTHER BOARDS AND BUREAUS WHO ARE LICENSING ENTITIES TO REVIEW AND APPROVE CURRICULUM AS WELL SO WE DON'T DIFFERENTIATE PRIORITIZING. WHICH WHAT SCHOOL WE LOOK AT FIRST WE LOOK AT THEM ALL EQUALLY BUT UNDER DIFFERENT REQUIREMENTS AS A YOUR BODY YOU KNOW POINTED OUT THAT IS A REQUIREMENT 4 DEGREES PROGRAM IS DEFINITELY DIFFERENT THAN A REQUIREMENT FOR VOCATIONAL PROGRAM- IT YOUR MAIN PRIORITIES ARE DEFINITELY REGARDING THE STILL DIDN'T PROTECTIONS LOWER LOOKING AT ENFORCEMENT COMPLIANCE INSPECTIONS AND SO FORTH WE HAVE PRIORITIES AND SET UP TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT THE SCHOOLS YOU KNOW WILL DO AN INSPECTION ON SCHOOLS THAT- HAVE RECEIVED MORE COMPLAINTS- THOUGH THEY'LL BE A HIGHER PRIORITY FOR US. FIRST IS THE SCHOOL HAVE RECEIVED ANY. COMPLAINT AS AN EXAMPLE. THANK PATHFINDER SPOT MISTER GABORONE. THANK YOU FOR YEP IN OUR IN A WORLD- OF YOU KNOW WORKING THE SCHOOL ON THE CLOTHES BY AS WELL AS SKIPPER- AS IT RELATES TO ECONOMIC RESTITUTION AT THE TIME OF CLOSURE THERE'S QUITE A VARIANCE AS WELL DEPEND ON THE TYPE OF SCHOOL- THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH YOU KNOW LIKE YOU MENTIONED THE LARGE- MULTI CAMPUS. ACCREDITED DEGREE GRANTING INSTITUTION WITH TITLE FOR FUNDING- IT IS A QUITE A DIFFERENT UNDERTAKING THEN OUT A SMALL CLOSURE OF SIX PEOPLE IN A SOLE PROPRIETORSHIP WHILE OFFERING OF A VERY NARROW PROGRAM- BUT BUT IN EACH CASE. WE TAKE THE THAT THE IMPACT ON THAT EQUALLY SERIOUSLY- THAT THE PRIORITIZATION IS REALLY ABOUT JUST GETTING OUT TO WITH MANY STUDENTS WHO ARE WHO ARE AFFECTED. BY THAT CLOSER AND QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AND THEN JUST- WE BUILD CAPACITY AND RESOURCES TO BE ABLE TO DEPLOY A- THE RESOURCES THAT ARE NECESSARY DEPENDING ON THAT VARIANTS OF THE TYPE OF SCHOOL IS CLOSING BUT THAT FROM A PRIORITY PATIENT STANDPOINT IT'S- YOU KNOW WHEN SCHOOL CLOSURES HAPPEN AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE GET OUT THERE MAKE CONNECTION WITH THE STUDENT WITH THE SCHOOL TRIED TO GET THEIR ACADEMIC AND FINANCIAL RECORDS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. BECAUSE EVERY EVERY MINUTE COUNTS. ONE OF TELL YOU. QUITE AMAZED THAT- GIVEN THE IN. OF THIS BUT- ISSUE PARTICULARLY IN THE AREA OF CONSUMER CONSUMER STUDENT CONSUMER PROTECTION- THAT THIS OPERATION- IS NOT FUNDED IN WHOLE OR AT LEAST IN PART OUT OF THE GENERAL FUND. AND SO MY NEXT QUESTION SORT OF PIGGY BACKS ON A QUESTION AND I BELIEVE MR FONG AS- HAVING TO DO WITH THE- THE SUSTAINABILITY OF THIS OPERATION IN AND LOOKING THROUGH THE BACKGROUND PAPERS YOU KNOW LIKE. TWO NOTED WHAT APPEARED TO BE STAGGERING FEE INCREASES AND I THINK IT WAS TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN. AS OPPOSED TO THE DATES THAT WERE EARLIER REFERENCED- STRUCTURAL DEFICITS DEFICITS CONTINUE DESPITE THOSE. RATHER SIGNIFICANT TO FEE INCREASES ACROSS THE BOARD. OUR BACKGROUND MATERIAL REFLECTS. DESPITE THE STRUCTURAL DEFICIT THAT THE BUREAU. IS REQUESTING A ADDITIONAL AUTHORITY INCLUDING FRANKLY WHAT APPEARS TO ME TO BE AUTHORITY TO MOVE INTO THE ACCREDITING AREA WHERE ACCREDITING BODIES. CURRENTLY PERFORM CERTAIN FUNCTIONS INCLUDING QUALITY OF FACULTY AND SOME OF THE OTHER. OTHER OTHER ASPECTS OF EDUCATION AT VARIOUS LEVELS- WHICH OBVIOUSLY PRESUMABLY WILL REQUIRE EVEN MORE WORK ON THE PART OF THE BUREAU- AND ITS PERSONNEL IN AN AREA IN AN ERA OF- FEE INCREASES AND STRUCTURAL DEFICITS. AND GIVEN THE- WHAT APPEARS TO BE SHRINKING BODY OF SCHOOLS. IN THIS SPACE PAYING THESE FEES I GUESS MY BASIC QUESTION IS. IN YOUR VIEW. IS THIS FINANCIAL MODEL. SUSTAINABLE I THINK THAT'S WHAT MR FONG WAS TRYING TO GET OUT HERE. AND IT'S CERTAINLY WHAT I'M TRYING TO GET AT OR SHOULD WE BE LOOKING AT A DIFFERENT FINANCIAL MODEL FOR THIS BUREAU IF IN FACT. YOUR VISION. THE ADMINISTRATION'S VISION IS A MUCH MORE EXPANSIVE ROLE IN THIS PRIVATE POST SECONDARY EDUCATION SPACE. BEYOND WHAT AT WHAT SOME WOULD ARGUE IS A CORE STUDENT CONSUMER PROTECTION STUDENT LOANS DEFAULTS. SCHOOL CLOSURES AND THE LIKE. SENATOR ROB I AGREE I MEAN I THINK THAT'S EXACTLY THE REASON WHY WE NEED AN ECONOMIST TO COME IN AND LOOK AT THE FUNCTION AND THE ROLE AT THE BUREAU AS WELL AS WHAT IS CURRENTLY THE REVENUE STREAM- FOR THE FOR THE BUREAU- WE'RE WE'RE WE REALLY THINK THAT IT'S IMPORTANT THAT SOMEONE COME IN THAT THEY PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION THAT THEY TAKE KIND OF A DEEP DIVE INTO THE INFORMATION. OUT THE PIANO HOW IT HOW IT WORKS AND THEN REPORT BACK AND LET US KNOW IF THERE'S SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO CHANGE THE WAY WORK WELL THE WAY WERE GATHERING REVENUE AND THE WAY THAT WERE FUNCTIONING AT. THE WHOLE PURPOSE BEHIND POTENTIALLY BRINGING IN THAT COMMENT TO LOOK AT THAT ISSUE. INCLUDING FUTURE PRODUCTION- I WORK AND HOW WE WOULD BE LOOKING AT THAT AS WELL AS THE WEAK I GET WEAK WE WILL LOOK FORWARD TO PARTNERING WITH YOU IN THAT ENDEAVOR RIGHT AND- HOPE HOPE THAT WE CAN COME TO SOME RESOLUTION FOR IT THAT IT COULD BE THAT REALLY ENDS- THAT THE PROTECTED IN. OKAY WHAT WAS THE LAST ONE FINAL. I KNOW IN THE BACKGROUND- I DON'T HAVE PAGE. BY THERE WAS A CAR. AND ALSO IN THE CONVERSATIONS IN THE LETTERS THAT WERE SUBMITTED TO THIS COMMITTEE AND TO THE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE. CONVERSATION ABOUT. MAKING SURE THAT THE LICENSES OR- CERTIFICATIONS ARE ISSUED AT THE END OF THE WHATEVER THE PROGRAM IS THAT YOU'RE- YOU'RE LOOKING AT. BUT MY QUESTION GOES TO THIS SO IN YOUR REVIEW OF THE SCHOOLS AND IN. ENSURING THAT THESE SCHOOLS THAT ARE WITHIN YOUR PURVIEW. OF DELIVER EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS AS PROMISED TO STUDENTS- DOES THIS BUREAU. MEASURE WHETHER STUDENTS WHO ARE TRAINED IN WHO COMPLETE THESE EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS. NOT ONLY RECEIVE A LICENSE OR CERTIFICATE AS PROMISED. BUT THAT THE STUDENTS ACTUALLY RECEIVE JOBS IN THE AREAS FOR WHICH THEY PAID TO BE TRAINED. AND IF NOT I'M IF NOT WHY NOT. OKAY I MEAN NOT OVER TO METRIC READY FOR THEM FREETHOUGHT. THANK YOU THE SCHOOLS ARE REQUIRED TO USE THE NET THE WHAT WE CALL THE SCHOOL DEPARTMENT FACT SHEET AND FAQ AND THEY ARE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE INFORMATION ON AND THEN THE PERSON TO START THE PROGRAM AND THE NUMBERS TO GRADUATE IF THERE'S ONE CONCERN ABOUT THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS TO TAKE THE EXAM AND THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS WHO PASSED THE EXAM OR FAIL THE EXAM AND. THEN AND THEN IT'S- PROGRAM IS A JOB AS A PRO THAT. TO LEAVE TO AT. A JOB IN SOME WAY THEN THEY HAVE TO REPORT. AND HOW MANY OF THOSE STUDENTS THAT DID GRADUATE. DID GET A JOB IN THAT FIELD AND WHAT THEIR INCOME IS SO ALL OF THAT INFORMATION IS REPORTED THROUGH OUR- ANNUAL REPORT INFORMATION AND IT WILL PROMPT FACT SHEETS AND THE PUBLIC ABOUT IT ALL OF THE STUDENTS- AND- SO WE RECEIVE THAT INFORMATION HOWEVER THERE ARE NO. STANDARDS THE SCHOOLS HAVE TO MEET SO IN. A ONLY SHOW THAT PERCENT GRADUATE RATE THERE ISN'T A- THAT MEN ARE STANDARD FOR THAT HOWEVER IT DOES TRIGGER AS TO GO AND LOOK AT THAT PROGRAM AND FIND OUT WHAT IS GOING ON IT YOU KNOW IS THERE SOMETHING WRONG WITH THIS PROGRAM THAT THESE STUDENTS ARE COMPLETING OUR GRADUATING FORM SO IT EVEN THOUGH THERE'S NOT A STANDARD WE DO USE IT AS A TOOL TO LOOK DEEPER AND AN INVESTIGATION STAND IN OUR- INSPECTIONS. WELL I'M NOT I'M NOT TOTALLY SURE THAT COMPLETELY ANSWERED MY QUESTION YOU KNOW ONE OF THE ISSUES OF STUDENT CONSUMER PROTECTION I ASSUME THAT DROVE THE CREATION OF THIS ENTITY WAS THE FACT THAT STUDENTS ARE PAYING A LOT OF MONEY IN THESE PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS FOR WHATEVER AND NOT NECESSARILY RECEIVING THE BENEFIT THAT THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE PROMISED. WHICH I ASSUME IN THE CASE OF JUST ABOUT EVERY STUDENT WHO'S PAYMENT WHO PAYS MONEY FOR EDUCATION IS A GOOD PAYING JOB IN THE FIELD THAT THEY SEEK THE TRAINING IN SO. GIVEN THAT. WHY ARE WE- INSISTING. THAT SCHOOLS TO DELIVER US INFORMATION ON HOW MANY OF THE STUDENTS TO GRADUATE AND OBTAIN A LICENSE OR CERTIFICATION. GETS A JOB IN THE FIELD FOR WHICH THEY WERE TRAINED BY THAT SCHOOL. THAT IS PART OF THE PART BACKSHEET REQUIREMENT THAT THEY DO REPORT AND JOB PLACEMENT AND ERNIE. IN THE FIELD ATHLETE TRAINING. THAT'S ACROSS THE BOARD. YES SIR DO WE HAVE THOSE STATISTICS BECAUSE I DON'T SEE THEM IN MY BACKGROUND MATERIAL. WE CAN GET THOSE FOR YOU THEY ARE PART AS THE- SCHOOL PARTS ACTUALLY SEMI ANNUAL REPORTS REPORTED ON IT THAT THE SCHOOL'S REPORT TO US YOUR EARLY SO WE CAN DEFINITELY GET YOU THAT INFORMATION. DO YOU HAPPEN AND IT IS NOT AVAILABLE. DO YOU HAPPEN TO REQUIRE THE AVERAGE PERCENTAGE RATE ACROSS THE BOARD FOR THE PRIVATE SCHOOLS THAT YOU OVERSEE. NO SIR WE DO NOT HAVE THAT LEGISLATIVE AUTHORITY TO REQUIRE THAT THEY NEED A PERCENTAGE RATE. NOW I'M CONFUSED I THOUGHT YOU INDICATED TO ME THAT YOU DO RECEIVE INFORMATION FROM THE SCHOOLS THAT TIES GRADUATION IN A PARTICULAR FIELD WITH JOB ACQUISITION IN THAT FIELD IS THAT CORRECT. YES SIR WE DO REQUIRE THAT THEY SUBMIT THAT INFORMATION TO US NAY PROVIDED TO IT HOWEVER THERE IS NO. AND LEGISLATION THAT REQUIRES THAT THEY NEED A SPECIFIC PERCENTAGE IN ANY OF THOSE CATEGORIES AND THAT THAT WOULD RESULT IN ANY TYPE OF. ACTION FROM THE BUREAU WELL I UNDERSTAND THAT I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S THE AVERAGE PERCENTAGE OF GRADUATES WHO OBTAIN JOBS IN THE FIELD FOR WHICH THEY WERE TRAINED. IN THE TOTAL. POOL OF SCHOOLS THAT YOU REVIEW. OH SORRY I MISUNDERSTOOD YOU AND WE CAN DEFINITELY GET YOU THAT INFORMATION I DON'T HAVE IT READILY AVAILABLE TO ME RIGHT THIS MOMENT OKAY IT IS ON OUR WEBSITE. OKAY I THINK THAT WOULD BE FINE BECAUSE I THINK THAT YOU SHOULD BE USING THAT AS A MEASURE OF YOUR SUCCESS AS WELL. BECAUSE OF STUDENTS PAY FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. TO GET A DEGREE OR A CERTIFICATE OR A LICENSE AND THEY CAN'T GET A JOB IN THAT FIELD AND WHAT'S THE VALUE OF THE PROGRAM. SO I WOULD BE I'M GONNA BE VERY INTERESTED IN TAKING A LOOK AT THAT. AND TRYING TO. YOU KNOW COMPARE APPLES TO APPLES WHEN IT COMES TO THIS. I THINK I'VE SPOKEN ENOUGH I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME AND YOUR PRESENTATION THANK YOU WHAT YOU'RE A LITTLE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH A SIMILAR GRAYSON FOLLOWED BY SOME A MEMBER CHOI. THANK YOU JERROLD THANK YOU CARILLO AND ALSO TO EACH OF THE OTHER CHAIRS AS WELL AND TO MY COLLEAGUES WHO HAVE ALREADY ASK QUESTIONS THAT I SHARE AND CONCERNS- THAT I SURE AS WELL I BELIEVE THAT- WE WE'VE COME TO THE SUBJECT A COUPLE TIMES ALREADY I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE IT JUST THAT ONE NEXT STEP FURTHER AGAIN GOING BACK TO FEES. AND THE- I GUESS FOR LACK OF BETTER WORDS THE STAGGERING INCREASE- THAT IS BEING PROPOSED ON THE FEES- IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE BUREAU BELIEVES THAT THE PROPOSED FEE INCREASES ARE ACTUALLY NOT ENOUGH TO KEEP THE BRUTAL SOLVENT LONG TERM IF THAT IS ACTUALLY THE CASE- THEM HOW LONG DO. DO WE PROJECT THAT OTHER MURAL WILL BE BACK TO ACTUALLY ASK FOR AN INCREASE ONCE AGAIN IN ORDER TO KEEP THE BUREAU SOLVE. ACTUALLY IN THAT THE BACKGROUND PAPER IN IN THAT THE STUDY ARE PROPELLED THAT CAN IT THAT CAN CONTINUE- BEING SOLVENT FOR QUITE AWHILE AND I DON'T. HAVE THE ACTUAL NUMBER HELP OUR HELP IN THE FUTURE THAT WOULD TAKE THEM IF THEY WERE ALL IMPLEMENTED AFTER BUT THEY DID NOT BE STUDIES- BUT I WILL. GET THAT INFORMATION AND GET BACK TO YOU BUT IT WOULD CARRY THAT FOR QUITE A FEW HERE. UPDATE ON ALLEN THAT BUT THAT THAT LEVEL THAT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED. BY THAT THE STUDY. THANK YOU. ALSO BUT I GET THAT IN THERE ALSO PAYING BACK THAT EIGHT MILLION DOLLAR LOAN WELL AND THEN GO BEING A EIGHT FIND OR AND FIFTY SO IT COULD CARRY THAT INTO THE THAT WHAT THAT WELL. IN THE END ABOUT THE STUDY. THANK I ALSO MY OF THE CONCERN OF SENATE CHAIR OF BUSINESS PROFESSION WHEN IT TO THE MISSION AND THE HUGE BROAD SWATH. OF IN WHICH YOU YOU A WHAT YOU'RE REALLY TO APPLY. AND IF THAT WAS THE CASE AND STAYING HYPER FOCUSED ON THAT MISSION HOW THAT MAY AFFECT- THE BUDGET AND WHAT EXPENDITURES WOULD RESULT FROM THAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ASSEMBLYMEMBER GRAYSON ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHOI. THANK YOU CHAIR. THROW YOUR QUESTION AND ANSWERS LOS A PRIOR SESSIONS SORRY ARE HAVE A- MOST OF THE ANSWERED THE HOWEVER I'M FOLLOWING UP I WAS SENATOR ROTH AND- ASSEMBLY MEMBER OPERATIONS QUESTIONS SO ARE YOUR CORE MISSION OF A PPV- P. IS SO CONSUMER PROTECTION AND- FOR YOU TO- YOUR ORGANIZATION IS OF A VERY. STRANGE A WORD THE I READ THE- IN THE MILITARY THAT THE ANOMALY OF ALL CONSUMER AFFAIRS A DIVISION OF THE BUREAU IS- AND THE YOUR AGENCIES ARE TOTALLY RELYING UPON ALL THE FEES SO THAT THE YOU WHILE COLLECTING. AND NOT BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY YOU ARE LOW OR REVENUE YOU ARE TRYING TO- STAYS ARE ONE AND BY RAISING THE FEES. ARE HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT- IF YOU DO REYES- FEES. ARE SOME OF THIS- A POST SECONDARY AGE IS- SO WE- ARE WITH THE X. A HAVE A STRUGGLE TO STAY AFLOAT DURING THE PHONE AND THAT MAKE ETCETERA. AND THEN ALSO A BEGINNING- THE U. S. STAGE SCORES. ARE AND- THEY NOT US. OUR LOT OF FOR THE HOSPITAL THE FEES ARE NOT MADE. UNDER EXISTING SCHOOLS UP TO FOR THE CLOTHES SO WARM TO A BRAND NEW ONE SO MAY NOT. BE ABLE TO YOU KNOW OPEN IT UP. IF THAT HAPPENS- DAN THOSE CHILDREN'S- THE DOCTOR MISSION TO YOUR TO PUT THEM- IF THOSE SCORES SO DO CLOSER A WILL WHEN THEY GO THEY WILL BECOME THE VICTIM. SO I WONDER IF THERE'S ARE AS- AS TO SENATOR RON FORMATION DEVICE SO. OF FEE- STRUCTURAL. REFORM OUT WITH THEIR SAID IN A DIFFERENT MODERATE ABOUT THE YOU CAN COME UP WITH A- AND ARE. WHETHER THERE IS ANY- TOTAL EVALUATION KNOCKED OUT ALL DATA FROM OUTSIDE DEMOCRAT A. B. A JACKET HAS- DONE ANY REVIEW OF YOUR AGENCY AND I MADE THE RECOMMENDATION SO THAT WOULD BE. MY RECOMMENDATION INSTEAD OF- TRYING TO- CONTINUE- THE BUREAU AS YEARS OF WHICH IS SO STRUGGLING IN A SOUND LIKE A VICIOUS CYCLE- BUT THE HIGHER. THE PRIVATE SCHOOLS SUCH ARE ATTRACTIVE SURVIVE AND THAT THEY CANNOT AND THEY KEEP ON CLOSING AND THE REVENUE COST OUR OWN AND YOU KEEP ON RAISING THE FUNDA HOW LONG. WILL IT IS A VICIOUS CYCLE WILL CONTINUE AND EVENTUALLY SB ALL MAY NOT BE- YOU KNOW SARPANCH STAYS ARE WANT AND IN THE FUTURE SO THEY WERE I THINK A HAS TO BE WISE TO HAVE. SOME BASIC EVALUATION OF ALL FINANCIAL FOR THE FUTURE LONG RUN- THE HIS- BETTER ARE. THE MY- WAS. AND THE THAT'S MY FOR ONE. AND OUR SECOND THEIR QUESTION IS- IF OF MORE SCHOOL WERE SO CLOSE AND THE MORE VICTIMS STUDENTS OF. ARE BEING FORCED TO LEAVE BEHIND WHAT KIND OF A- BACK UP SO DO YOU HAVE A RECOMMENDATION AS TO WOULD YOU HAPPEN FOR THE STUDENTS OF WHAT TO DO. LET OF THE SCHOOLS ALL FULL. THEIR FIELD MAY BE DIFFERENT BECAUSE OF THEIR AUTHORITY HIGHLY. SPECIALIZED TO SCORES ARE NOT GO MEDICAL OR NURSING. WHAT TECHNOLOGY SO SOME OF THE SCORES AND MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ABSORB WELL FOR STARTERS. AND THAT THERE MAY BE. ONE IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA SYMON ONE FOR THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND THE GEOGRAPHIC FACTOR MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ABSORB THEM BECAUSE OF THE DISTANCE. SEOUL ARE. YOU'RE FREE INCREASE OUR- HOPE WOULD NOT. FORCE THEM BUT THE MAY IN FACT THE NEGATIVITY IN SUCH A MANNER SO WHAT KIND OF OPERATIONS YOU HAVE SO THAT'S MY SECOND. QUESTION SINCE I'M ASKING LET ME JUST OF PRODUCT ON THE QUESTION. NUMBER THIRTY IS THAT AMONG THEM MATERIAL THAT OUR HEROES AS A EXEMPTION SHUFFLE RELIGIOUS SO. OUR INSTITUTION IS A AND IF THAT THE CONTINUOUS SO THE EXEMPTION SO DONE YOU WOULD REQUIRE MORE THAN 50% OF- EACH COURSE MUST BE. FOCUSED ON THE RELIGION OF PER. YOU KNOW THOSE ARE THEIR CURRENT. NEWS TO BE- RELIGIOUS PRINCE FOR MORE THAN HALF OF THEIR- I'M IN UP TO ME GREAT. OUR AMONG MANY PHOTO ON. THIS OF SAID THEY NEED TO ON. IT THOUGH THOSE SOME MIGHT HAVE BEEN ESTABLISH BY NONPROFIT OPEN. OR GROUP- FOR THE OPEN TO MEET MISSION BUTTON ON THE NEED TO BE SEVEN HOURS. THEY A VEHICLE MISSION MAY BE IN ORDER TO ROUTE TO A TRAINED HIGHLY TECHNICAL. MODERN TECHNOLOGY BUT THE A FOR OUR CITY OUR FOUNDER AND YOU FORCED ME OUT TO TEACH A MORE THAN HALF OF THE CURRICULUM ON RELIGIOUS PRINCIPLES THEN THE DIRECTOR OF THE PROGRAM WOULD BE AIRPORT ALONG THE AND IT'LL BECOME IT'LL- IS MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE SO WITNESSES. ARE 50% REQUIREMENT COME FROM I THINK OF THAT HAS TO BE- IN ORDER AMONG. THIS MESSAGE SIX SEVEN DIFFERENT OFF COURSES SO YOU KNOW DAY YOU TEACH ACTING ONE SESSION. ARE IN THE RELIGIOUS OF PRINCIPLE STYLE MIGHT BE ENOUGH FIND THE STEERER TEACHING THE BIBLE IF THAT'S A CHRISTIAN SCORE I'M SHORE SO THAT IS SAW. ARE THE RELIGIOUS SCHOOL BECAUSE- NOR DOES SCORES OR TEACH SUCH AS SUCH A RELIGIOUS OF PRINCIPLE BUT OF IT IS THE LACK OF SUPPRESSING RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS ON. NOT TO SURVIVE OR NOT TO START. SUCH A POST SECONDARY EDUCATION IN A BY THE RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS SO THAT IS OUR- BUT TO ME. FOR NO UNKNOWN REASON SUPPRESSING DISCRIMINATION OUR AND ARE OWN SCIENTIFIC REASON WHY DOES IT HAVE TO BE 50% OFF ON THEIR CURRICULUM HAS TO BE RELEASED PRINCIPLE. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ALL OF YOUR QUESTIONS- I'LL GO IN ORDER AT THAT THE WAY YOU BACK THEM. SO THE FIRST ONE I THINK YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT WHAT SPECIFIC TO AND HOW WE LOOK AT THE STRUCTURE OF THE FEES ADD- AT THE END OF STUDY SO YEAH WE HAVE ACTUALLY. OUT THEY PART THAT THE PART THAT BUT WE BROUGHT IN A THIRD AGAINST HE THAT I PERFORM EVERY UP THE THAT BUREAU AND IN CURRENT FACTOR AND THE THAT BE A SAID IT CHARGING. LOOKING WHAT THE EXPAND. WERE AND THAT COULD NOT THAT HE SAID HE IS THE RECOMMENDATION- YOU HAVE A SIGNED UP IN THE BACK. PAPER I'M FROM THAT. IT WASN'T OUTSIDE PARTY IN. WHAT THE BUREAU IT FELT. I THINK MEN AND GET A AUDIT AND LOOK AT THE- THAT WE- THE NEXT. THAT THE BUREAU AND THAT WOULD RECKON. THAT THAT BE THE YOU HAVE IN YOUR- YOUR- THAT. I'M WITH THE IN. THAT THEY BACK. I'M HOWEVER WHEN BE. AND WE LOOKED. THAT THE STATE AND WE LOOK AT BACK OF. AND THINKING ABOUT WHAT KIND OF THE THING IS IF THEY. THE THING OF ALL IN THE- THOUGH THE WAVE. WE CALLING THESE BE. WE HAVE THANK IN FACT WE DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO HAVE TO CALL JUST BECAUSE THEY- PAY BUT BUREAU FEES. AND THAT'S WHY OUR SECOND RECOMMENDED KIND OF. IT QUESTION A LITTLE BIT IN LOOKING AT- STANDPOINT WHAT OKAY WE DO AT MANTA WE GOT OUT THERE. THAT PEOPLE WE ARE- AND I. SAY WE'VE CAUGHT THE IT. AFTER EXPENDITURES AND REVENUE AND SEE IF THERE ARE DIFFERENT FUNDING FOR WORK THAT NEEDS. TO HAPPEN HERE IN A DIFFERENT METHOD THAN WHAT IS CURRENTLY GATHERING. I'M THAT WILL BE VERY DIFFERENT WAIT COULD GET AND WE'VE ALREADY BEEN STARTED OUT OF THOSE DISCUSSIONS WITH STAKEHOLDERS THAT. AND WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO CONTINUING THAT IN THE FUTURE. BUT THAT'S IT IN REGARDS TO YOUR FIRST QUESTION WE GOT YOUR BACK FIVE AND JUST LIKE WITH ANY SCHOOL CLOSURE ADAM AND I GOT BEHALF MR ABOUT WHERE THEY TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THIS AS WELL. BUT JUST LIKE WITH ANY SCHOOL CLOSURE AGAIN OUR GOAL IS NOT TO RAISE THE FEES THAT HAVE VEHICLES WELL. I'M A CURRENT- WE DO HAVE A PROCESS OF REACHING OUT TO THOSE STUDENTS AND IF THEY THINK THEM THROUGH THE PROCESS THAT I WENT AND TALKED. A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT. IN ABOUT MAYBE A LITTLE HIGHER LEVEL. THANK YOU TO THANK YOU FOR THE CALL- YEAH I THINK I THE QUESTION. AGAIN THE FACT THE LOCAL. OF THAT IF SCHOOLS WERE- THERE. BEGAN TO BE A TREND SCHOOL CLOSING BECAUSE OF THE IMPLICATION OF FEET INCREASE IT. IS REALLY A QUESTION ABOUT YOU KNOW THE QUESTION ABOUT HOW WE WOULD ADAPT. THE QUESTION AOUT HOW THE SECTOR ITSELF I THINK WHAT IT DOCTOR AND IF IT IF THE SECTOR HAS PROVEN BASED ON HISTORY COULD BE PRETTY ADAPTABLE TO DIFFERENT SITUATIONS WHETHER IT BE. EMERGING JOB MARKET OR NEW TYPES OF TRAINING TECHNOLOGY- MOVES TO APPLICANTS EDUCATION- A LOT OF FOR PROFITSCHOOLS THAT HAVE HAVE ENTERED INTO CLOSE PARTNERSHIPS WITH LOCAL WORKFORCE. BOARDS TO SORT OF- MAKE THAT EXPLORER YOU KNOW LIKE WHAT WHAT'S THE BEST POSSIBLE TRAINING FOR THE NEEDS- LOCALLY AND IN A SITUATION LIKE THAT IF THAT WERE TO BE IMPACTED I TRUST THAT- THAT THOSE. BUT THOSE DISCUSSIONS WOULD HAPPEN AND- WHETHER IT BE- YOU KNOW DEVELOPING NEW PROGRAMS PARTNERING. WITH OTHER ENTITIES THAT HAVE PREVIOUSLY PROVIDED THAT PROGRAM- THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES I KNOW HAVE HAD A LARGE INVESTMENT IN AKURE EDUCATION PROGRAMS I'M SURE THEY WOULD HAVE A VITAL ROLE IN THAT AS WELL. AND AS IT RELATES TO ASK OUR ROLE WOULD BE IN- STAR WOULD BE THE LIAISON OF THAT INFORMATION AND WE WILL HOPEFULLY BE- PROACTIVELY SORT OF PREPARING AND INVOLVED- AT A HIGH LEVEL IN TERMS OF. THAT POSSIBLE IMPLICATION THAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO. AND THEN BE PREPARED TO RESPOND. TO A COMING OUT WHICH PERSPECTIVE. AND THEN REGARDING YOUR LAST QUESTION I'M IN A PATH ABOUT THE METRIC READY TO TALK ABOUT I'M THE RECOMMENDATION FOR THAT RELIGIOUS EXEMPTION AND THAT FIFTY PERCENT. AND AT THE END OF THE DAY IT REALLY IS TO MAKE SURE THAT- THE INTENT OF THE LEGISLATURE WHEN THEY PASSED THAT THE ORIGINAL LANGUAGE. ACTUALLY IS WHAT WE ARE MEETING AND WHAT THOSE SCHOOLS ARE MEETING AND THAT WE'RE NOT ACCEPTING SCHOOLS THAT SHOULDN'T BE SO. I'M WANTING TO MAKE SURE THAT HE- EXPENSE THAT. YEAH YEAH THE WAY THE CURRENT LAW IS WRITTEN IT BUT- THAT THE INSTRUCTION IS LIMITED TO. THE PRINCIPLES ABOUT RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATION. BUT THE BUREAU IS UNCLEAR ON WHAT THE LIMITED. TO THE PRINCIPLES IS. IT AB WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THAT- WHAT WHAT DOES THAT REALLY MEAN WHAT IS THE INTENT OF THE LEGISLATORS FOR THAT. THE WAY IT'S CURRENTLY WHAT YOU CURRENTLY WRITTEN AND ALLOWS A RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATION. TO OFFER INSTRUCTION COVER ANY AND ALL AREAS WITH VERY LITTLE- REFERENCES TO THE PRINCIPLES OF THAT RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATION. THEREFORE STUDENTS. MAY RECEIVE INSTRUCTION IN ANY SUBJECT WAS BARELY A MENTION. OF THE PRINCIPLES ABOUT RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATION SO WE'RE REALLY JUST LOOKING AT. HOW WE CAN ENSURE THAT WE ARE IMPLEMENTING THIS EXEMPTION AND. THE INTENT OF THE LEGISLATORS. AND ALL JUST SURE THAT WE PUT THOSE STUDENTS IN FOR THOSE- FACILITIES AND INTO THOSE EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS AND MAKE SURE THAT IF IT IS AT AN EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM THAT NEEDS MORE OVERSIGHT BY THE BUREAU THAT THEN THEY YOU NEED TO GET THAT APPROVAL AND BE APPROVED BY THE BUREAU. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE'LL GO DO- ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRAYSON FELL BY CHAIR ROTH THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND JUST SO I CAN GO ON RECORD ADD COMMENT ON- THIS LAST QUESTION THAT WAS ADDRESSED. A SLIPPERY SLOPE FOR A GIRL TO START DECIDING WHEN- AND INSTITUTIONS RELIGIOUS ENOUGH. AND THERE ARE OTHER WAYS THAT WE CAN DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT AN INSTITUTION IS A FIVE OH ONE C. THREE. NON PROFIT OR IS RELIGIOUS AND- TO START MEASURING WITH PERCENTAGES- TO ME IS A DANGEROUS GROUND AND I'M- VERY UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THAT. I THINK IF IT IS LISTED AND RECOGNISED AS A RELIGIOUS INSTITUTION THAT SHOULD BE GOOD ENOUGH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ZHOROV. A RESEARCHER I YOU KNOW I HAD MY- STAFF PULL THE- JOB PLACEMENT FORM OFF OF YOUR WEBSITE. I JUST TO TAKE A LOOK AT IT I JUST HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS HOW TO THE SCHOOLS COLLECT THIS DATA. AND WHO COMPLETES THE FORM. EACH SHARE AD OUR OUTSIDE PAY AND FOR THEIR SENATOR ROB AND THEN PASS IT UP. YOU WILL NEED TO ADD ANYTHING- EACH YEAR EACH SCHOOL HAVE TO PROVIDE ANNUAL DATA YOU'D BE- ZERO- GETS REQUIRED AT THE END OF THAT FOLLOWING YEAR SO THEY WORK ON IT DURING THE POST LIKE TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN THEY WORK ON THAT DATA DURING TWENTY TWENTY AND THEN IT'S REQUIRED THAT THEY PROVIDE IT- BY THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY SO ALL ABOUT YOUR PROVIDED. BY THAT WELL WHAT ABOUT. AND WHERE DOES THE DATA COME. IT DECADE IT COMES FROM THE INSTITUTION MY UNDERSTAND THAT BECAUSE THEY SUBMIT THE FORM THE WORD IS THE INSTITUTION GET THE DATA IS IT A STUDENTS SURVEYED TO THEY GO TO THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD THE EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT OR SOME OTHER GOVERNMENT AGENCY TO PULL EMPLOYMENT DATA MATCHED TO SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS OR- I TENS. IT IS A SURVEY THAT THEY DEAL WITH THE STUDENT AT THAT POINT. DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE RESPONSE RATE IS PER INSTITUTION WHEN THIS INSTITUTION SENDS OUT. A STUDENT SURVEY. I DO NOT HAVE THE SPECIFICS AND HERE WITH ME AT THIS TIME. GET THAT INFORMATION YEAH IS THAT DATA THAT'S NOT ON THE FORM SO IS THAT DATA THAT'S- COLLECTED BY THE BUREAU IN SOME OTHER FASHION SPECIFICALLY THE DATA ON THE STUDENT. RESPONSE RATE REGARDING POST GRADUATION EMPLOYMENT. THE FISCAL THE REQUIRED TO KEEP THE BACKUP DOCUMENTATION FOR THESE REPORTS. AND THE BUREAU PERIODICALLY DOES AND CHECK ON THOSE REPORTS SO THE BUREAU HAS ACCESS TO THAT DATA- TO DOUBLE CHECK IT WELL I WAS GOING TO ASK IF YOU WANTED THE DATA. TO ENSURE THE ACCURACY OF THE REPORT SO LET ME FOLLOW ALONG WITH THAT SO THEN IF WE- AS EITHER A JOINT COMMITTEE OR THE SENATE COMMITTEE REQUESTED DATA ON THE SCHOOLS WITHIN YOUR- THE PURVIEW OF YOUR OVERSIGHT. AS TO THE RESPONSE RATE. PER INSTITUTION WOULD YOU HAVE THAT DATA. I'M SORRY CAN YOU PLEASE REPEAT THAT LAST PART OF THE QUESTION WELL I'M TRYING TO FIND OUT IF STUDENTS GET JOBS AFTER THEY GRADUATE AND YOU SAID YOU HAD A FORM AND I PULLED THE FORM. AND I ASK WHO COMPLETES THE FORM IT'S THE INSTITUTION I ASK WHERE THE INSTITUTION GOT THE DATA GETS THE DATA AND YOU SAID FROM THE STUDENTS IN A SURVEY. I ASK WHAT'S THE RESPONSE RATE WHEN THE INSTITUTIONS SEND OUT STUDENT. SURVEYS WHICH SHOULD BE RELEVANT. AND NOW I'VE ASK YOU DO YOU KEEP TRACK BY INSTITUTION OF THE STUDENT RESPONSE RATE WITH RESPECT TO THE- POST GRADUATION. JOB SURVEY AND MY POINT IS THIS. GIVEN INSTITUTION PROVIDES A REPORT BASED ON A STUDENT'S SURVEY AND TEN PERCENT. OF THE STUDENT GRADUATES RESPONDED I'M NOT SURE. HOW VALUABLE THAT DATE IS AND SO MY QUESTION TO YOU IS. IN YOUR AUDITING IN YOUR REVIEW DID YOU DETERMINE HOW ACCURATE. AND VALUABLE THIS DATA IS IF WE'RE IF WE BOTHER TO COLLECTED. SO CURRENTLY WE DO DO SPOT CHECKS ON THAT DATA IN AS PART OF THE INFECTIONS THAT WHAT YOU DO. HOWEVER AND WE BELIEVE THAT THIRTEEN FORTY IS DEFINITELY GOING TO HELP IN THIS MATTER WHERE WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO MATCH THE DATA WITH EDT TO GET MORE ACCURATE INFORMATION. WELL I CERTAINLY HOPE SO AND SO IN THE INTERIM WHAT I'D LIKE TO HAVE COMING TOWARD. AT LEAST THE SENATE SIDE OF THIS JOINT COMMITTEE. IS A REPORT ON THE AVERAGE STUDENT RESPONSE RATE IN THE INSTITUTIONS THAT YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR REVIEWING WITH RESPECT TO THE POST GRADUATION. EMPLOYMENT DATA. AND THEN WE'LL SEE IF WE NEED TO. TURN THIS ISSUE UP A LITTLE FURTHER. OKAY I APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOU SIR THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER. THANK YOU ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS IN THE CHAMBERS AT THIS TIME. C. OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHOI. OKAY LET ME ADD ONE MORE QUESTION THAT IS REGARDING THE TWO TRACKS OF ALL APPROVING ONE IS- THROUGH- RECEIVING OUTSIDE ACCREDITATION AND THE OTHER ONE IS A FULL APPROVAL HI- OF GAS SO THAT IS A FULL APPROVAL THROUGH- A B. P. P. E. N. I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF YOU HAVE A SUCH A DATE OFF- WHAT PERCENTAGE. OF ALL POST SECONDARY EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS ARE ARE APPROVED BY ACCREDITATION AND- THE- THE RULES BORDER- REVIEW AND- RELATED TO THAT- OUR SAID THINKING IF YOU ARE. A. B. P. P. HE CONDUCTS A FULL ORDER- APPROVAL PROCEDURE ABOUT WERE TAKE TO YOUR STAFF TIME AND A LOT OF WAY EXPENSES SO AND. THE LENGTHY PERIOD GO. I WONDERED THE- THE METHOD OF ALL. APPROVING THROUGH ACCREDITATION MAY SAVE- YOUR BEERUS COSTS ARE IN THE FUTURE. THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION WE HAVE APPROXIMATELY AND- FIVE HUNDRED AND SIXTY ONE OF THE SCHOOLS THAT HAVE A FULL APPROVAL AND THE FINALLY FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY SEVEN THAT HAVE THE APPROVAL BY MEANS OF ACCREDITATION. AND ALTHOUGH THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE APPLICATIONS ARE QUITE DIFFERENT TO THE APPROVAL BY MEANS OF ACCREDITATION OF A MUCH LOWER COST AS WE'RE NOT-LOOKING AT THE INFORMATION THAT WE LOOK AT ONE OF FOR A FULL APPROVAL FOR THE BUREAU HAS FOUND THAT- MANY TIMES WE'RE FINDING THAT THE APPROVAL BY MEANS OF ACCREDITATION SCHOOL WHEN WE GO OUT TO DO INSPECTIONS ARE WE GET COMPLAINTS. THAT THEY ARE NOT PROVIDING THE PROPER STUDENT DISCLOSURES ARE SOMETIMES EVEN IN A ROMAN AGREEMENT TO THE TO THE STUDENT AT THE TIME THAT THE STUDENT ROLES WHICH ARE PART OF THE OUR MINIMUM REQUIREMENT THAT THAT THE STATE HAS FOR THE SCHOOL SO WHAT WE- THE REASON REALLY BEHIND THIS IS TO. ENSURE THAT THE THAT THE INSTITUTIONS ARE. FOLLOWING THE CALIFORNIA REQUIREMENTS. FOR APPROVAL VERSES THE ACCREDITOR REQUIREMENTS AND THAT WE'RE INSURING THAT THE STUDENTS ARE GETTING THE PROPER DISCLOSURES UP FRONT AND THAT THEY HAVE AN ACTUAL ENROLLMENT AGREEMENT THAT. PROTECTS THEM IN WITH ALL THE DISCLOSURES THAT ARE PROVIDED- THIRTY WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE COST WOULD DEFINITELY BE- MORE AND IT WOULD BE MORE WORK FOR THE BUREAU- BUT IT WOULD BE MORE WORK IN THE FRONT END VERSUS THE BACK END SO WE THINK IT'LL- AND EVENTUALLY BALANCE OUT AND IF WE DO IT IN A PHASED IN APPROACH. OR EVEN IF WE MODIFY IT VERSES- NOT GETTING RID OF APPROVAL BY MEANS OF ACCREDITATION COMPLETELY THAT MAYBE MODIFY IT WHERE WE CAN REQUIRE THAT WE RECEIVE MORE INFORMATION UP FRONT CATALOGS AND ROAMING AGREEMENT FINANCIAL STABILITY IN THOSE TYPE OF THINGS. I HOPE THAT HELPS ANSWER YOUR QUESTION ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE WILL TURN THE CONVERSATION BACK TO PUBLIC COMMENT. IF YOU ARE A MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC. A PLEASE BE REMINDED THAT. WOULD LIKE YOU TO LIMIT YOUR COMMENTS TO NO MORE THAN TWO MINUTES. A SCENE NO MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC CURRENTLY IN THE CHAMBERS AT THIS TIME WILL MOVE TO. THE OPERATOR OF KNOWLEDGE AND TAKE A PUBLIC COMMENT. FOR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WHICH IS TESTIFIED FOR THE BUREAU FOR PRIVATE POSTSECONDARY EDUCATION. WILL BE USING BE MODERATED TELEPHONE SERVICE AGAIN THE CALL IN NUMBER IS EIGHT SEVEN SEVEN. SIX NINE TWO. EIGHT NINE FIVE SEVEN AND THE ACCESS CODE IS TWO FOUR. TWO SIX. TWO THREE SEVEN. OPERATIVE PLEASE WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. IF YOU WISH TO MAKE PUBLIC COMMENT PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO AT THIS TIME. OUR FIRST COMMENT COMES FROM THE LINE WITH YOU PLEASE GO AHEAD. GOOD MORNING SERVICE MEMBERS ARE BACK ON MARKET SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE CENTRE FOR PUBLIC INTEREST LAW CHILDREN'S ADVOCACY INSTITUTE. AND THE VETERANS LEGAL CLINIC WE SUPPORT THE MUCH NEEDED REFORMS AFTER BUREAU FOR PRIVATE POSTSECONDARY EDUCATION PROPOSED BY BOTH THE GOVERNOR AND BY THE COMMITTEES AND THE ACT ON A NOW PREPARED FOR TODAY'S HEARING. THANK YOU SO MUCH. CONNECT COMMENT COMES TO MIND TWENTY ONE PEOPLE HAD. YES MY NAME IS REQUIRED I AM THE PAST CHAIR AND CURRENT BOARD MEMBER THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF PRIVATE POST SECONDARY SCHOOLS. LIKE TO THANK THE CHAIRS OF THE COMMITTEES FOR CONDUCTING THIS HEARING AND FOR THE OPPORTUNITY SPEAK TODAY. WANT TO BEGIN BY ADDRESSING THE PROPOSED BPP FEE INCREASES AND TO GIVE YOU SOME PERSPECTIVE IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN MY SCHOOLS PAID THE BILL TWENTY NINE THOUSAND DOLLARS. AFTER THE RECENT INCREASES WE PAID NINETY THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS OR 2100% PLUS INCREASE. THAT WOULD BE AN ASSET TO PAY AN ADDITIONAL FORTY FOUR PERCENT. TO BRING OUR FEES WELL OVER A HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. IN ADDITION TO DC'S AS HAS ALREADY BEEN MENTIONED WE ALSO PAY INSTITUTIONAL PROGRAMMATIC ACCREDITING AGENCIES. AS WELL AS OTHER STATE BOARDS. THERE ARE AN ADDITIONAL TWENTY SEVEN OTHER FEES OUTLINED IN THE PROPOSAL THE INCREASES FOR THESE FEES ARE STAGGERING. RANGING FROM CHAIRMAN ROSS MR FONG MR CHOI. BUT THIS MODEL IS SIMPLY NOT SUSTAINABLE OVER TIME AND WE DO FEAR THAT. MAY RESULT IN THESE ADDITIONAL COSTS BEING PASSED ON TO STUDENTS. ADDITIONALLY WE'D LIKE TO- A STATE THAT WE ARE IN SUPPORT OF THE CONTINUED USE OF THE STRIP FUN. BUT ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE RECENT RETRO ACTIVE STUDENTS HE INCREASE. STUDENTS IN INSTITUTIONS NEED ADVANCE NOTICE AND THE GIRLFRIEND STRIPTEASE ARE GOING TO BE COLLECTED. WE RECOMMEND THE ACT BE UPDATED TO PROVIDE MORE TRANSPARENT AND EFFICIENT PROCESS. WE DO BELIEVE DISCUSSES THE BEST WAY TO MITIGATE. ANY HARM TO STUDENTS THAT DOESN'T RESOLVE BY THE INSTITUTION. FOR THE FEDERAL STUDENT LOAN FORGIVENESS PROGRAM. AND FINALLY I'D LIKE TO ADDRESS THE PROPOSAL TO ADD SECURITY BONDS. WE DO NOT SUPPORT THE USE OF SURETY BONDS IT'S A COMPLEX AN INEFFECTIVE METHOD TO MITIGATE STUDENT HARM. OR SCHOOL CLOSURE COSTS THIRTY BONDS ARE DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN. NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR NEW SCHOOL ENTITY TO QUALIFY FOR. AND WOULD LIKELY BE UNDER UTILIZED IN A MANNER SIMILAR TO THE CURRENT STRESS. CAPS IS LOOKING FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND CONTINUING TO SEE IMPROVEMENT WITH THE PPP THANK YOU. NEXT DEADLINE CAN. SO I THINK I CAN MAKE. YES WE CAN THANK YOU. HELLO OKAY BOOK- HI MY NAME IS JENNIFER DEMAND AND YOU GUYS MIGHT RECOGNIZE ME IF YOU READ THE ARTICLE- THAT WAS DONE AND I ENJOYED BY CALMATTERS. IN THE DOCUMENT OF THE- SO I ACTUALLY HAD A CASE NUMBER WITH THE VP CASE NUMBER ONE ZERO ZERO ONE SEVEN ZERO FIVE. AND MY CASE WAS DISMISSED BECAUSE- THEY SAID THEY HAD NO JURISDICTION BUT I ACTUALLY HAD A LETTER TO THE- TO THE OPPOSITE- AND SO- I JUST WANT TO READ YOU- KIND OF THE RESPONSE FROM THE INDIVIDUAL ENFORCEMENT INVESTIGATOR FROM THE COMPLAINT INVESTIGATIONS UNIT YOU CAN KIND OF SEE- THAT I REALLY HAVE A PROBLEM WITH IT PATTING THEMSELVES ON THE BACK. CRAP ESPECIALLY GIVEN- THE WAY THAT THEY'RE CONDUCTING THEMSELVES SO- THAT THEY INDIVIDUALS AND THANK YOU FOR SUBMITTING YOUR COMPLAINT THE INVESTIGATION IS COMPLETE THE DEPOSITION LETTER ATTACHED FOR YOUR RECORD- AND THEN I'M GONNA READ YOU A PARAGRAPH OF THAT. LETTER THAT WAS SENT TO ME DURING THE INVESTIGATION OF YOUR COMPLAINTS REGIONAL RECORDS WERE OBTAINED FROM THE SCHOOL AND IT WAS FUND THAT YOU'VE GRADUATED WITH A BACHELOR AND MASTER'S DEGREES.

GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MY NAME IS RACHEL BLEACHER NINE PROVIDING COMMENTS ON BEHALF OF A GROUP OF PSYCHOANALYTIC INSTITUTE PSYCHOANALYTIC INSTITUTES ARE UNIQUE AMONG OTHER PRIVATE POSTSECONDARY INSTITUTIONS REGULATED BY THE BUREAU FIRST THE INSTITUTE TO PROVIDE CONTINUING EDUCATION AND ENHANCE TRAINING TO LICENSE PSYCHOTHERAPIST AND PSYCHOANALYSIS SECOND THE INTO INSTITUTES DO NOT ACCEPT FEDERAL FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE FOR THEIR STUDENTS AND DO NOT LEAVE STUDENTS WITH THE AN UNMANAGEABLE DEBT. FINALLY THE STUDENTS ARE SEEKING FURTHER EDUCATION TO PROVIDE AN IMPORTANT SERVICE TO MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO ADDRESS MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES THAT HAVE ONLY BEEN EXACERBATED BY COVERT NINETEEN. I BOTH THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS AND COMMITTEE STAFFER AWARE PSYCHOANALYTIC INSTITUTES HAVE RELIED N THE STATUTORY EXEMPTIONS IN EXISTING LAW TO PROVIDE THEIR SERVICES. UNFORTUNATELY IN THE LAST FEW YEARS THE BUREAU HAD BEEN LASTING CONSISTENT IN ITS REVIEW OF APPLICATIONS FOR THE STATUTORY EXTENSION WHICH HAS LEFT MANY OF THE INSTITUTIONS OF THE STATE OF LIMBO RELATIVE TO THEI ALREADY TO OPERATE. WE ASK THAT THE COMMITTEE RECOGNIZE THAT THE LAW GOVERNING OVERSIGHT OF PRIVATE POSTSECONDARY INSTITUTIONS INCLUDES AN EXEMPTION PROCESS BECAUSE OF THE RECOGNITION THAT SOME INSTITUTIONS ARE OFFERING VERY SPECIALIZED EDUCATION TO HIGHLY EDUCATED PROFESSIONALS. BUT THAT'S NOT NOT THE STATE RESUSCITATE THE LEVEL OF OVERSIGHT NEEDED FOR OTHER INSTITUTIONS. WE WILL BE SUBMITTING PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO STATUTES GOVERNING EXEMPTION TO CLARIFY THE APPLICATION OF THE EXEMPTION THESE INSTITUTES AND TO ENSURE CONSISTENCY WITH THE ORIGINAL LEGISLATIVE INTENT OF THE EXEMPTION. FURTHER GIVEN THE UNIQUE NATURE OF THE EDUCATIONAL OFFERINGS WE WOULD ENCOURAGE FURTHER EVALUATION OF THE INSTITUTE'S ABILITY TO OFFER DOCTORAL DEGREES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME.
