WILL THAT PROCESS BE THAN TO

00:16:37.129 --> 00:16:38.630
TRANSFER THEM BACK INTO LOCAL

00:16:38.697 --> 00:16:41.633
CARE. AND I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT

00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:43.268
THAT THIS IS A CONVERSATION

00:16:43.335 --> 00:16:45.838
THAT. WE NEED TO INCLUDE OUR

00:16:45.904 --> 00:16:48.006
PARTNERS AND CONTINUE TO WORK

00:16:48.073 --> 00:16:49.675
WITH ALL OF THOSE STAKEHOLDERS

00:16:49.742 --> 00:16:50.976
INCLUDING THE CHIEF PROBATION

00:16:51.043 --> 00:16:54.012

PARTNERS- IN TERMS OF HOW DO WE

00:17:00.352 --> 00:17:02.121
LOOK AT WHAT THAT PROCESS IS

00:17:02.187 --> 00:17:04.790
AND MOST IMPORTANTLY. THAT EACH

00:17:04.857 --> 00:17:06.392

00:17:06.458 --> 00:17:07.359
MENTIONED HAVE VERY UIQUE

00:17:07.426 --> 00:17:08.927
NEEDS AND SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT

00:17:08.994 --> 00:17:11.530
TRANSITION WE NEED TO REALIZE

00:17:11.597 --> 00:17:13.132
IT'S DIFFERENT THAN WHAT WE'VE

00:17:13.198 --> 00:17:14.166
DONE IN THE PAST WHEN WE'RE

00:17:14.233 --> 00:17:15.968
TALKING ABOUT REENTRY IS A PART

00:17:16.034 --> 00:17:17.469
DISCHARGED. THIS IS A TRANSFER

00:17:17.536 --> 00:17:19.805
OF CARE WHICH MEANS WE NEED TO

00:17:19.872 --> 00:17:21.473
TAKE A LOOK CASE BY CASE OUT

00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:23.509
WHAT EACH OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS

00:17:23.575 --> 00:17:25.978
EITHER NAME- AND WORK WITH OUR

00:17:26.044 --> 00:17:28.747
PARTNERS ON HOW WE THEN MAKE

00:17:28.814 --> 00:17:30.048
SURE THERE'S A CONTINUUM OF

00:17:30.115 --> 00:17:31.984
CARE. FOR WHATEVER THOSE NEEDS

00:17:32.050 --> 00:17:33.519
ARE FOR EXAMPLE GOING BACK TO

00:17:33.585 --> 00:17:36.455
THE MENTAL HEALTH EXAMPLE- THAT

00:17:36.522 --> 00:17:38.023
LEVEL OF CARE WOULD NEED TO

00:17:38.090 --> 00:17:40.559
CONTINUE. AND SO I VALUE THE

00:17:40.626 --> 00:17:43.629
PARTNERSHIPS- WITH ALL OF THOSE

00:17:43.695 --> 00:17:45.397
AGENCIES AND THE WORK THAT AND

00:17:45.464 --> 00:17:46.598
CONVERSATIONS THAT WE'VE

00:17:46.665 --> 00:17:48.734
ALREADY HAD TOWARDS HOW WE

00:17:48.801 --> 00:17:51.036
START TO MAP THIS OUT. WE ARE

00:17:51.103 --> 00:17:52.871
ALL FOCUSED ON THE GOAL OF

00:17:52.938 --> 00:17:54.239
MAKING SURE THAT THESE ARE

00:17:54.306 --> 00:17:55.941
CARED FOR IN THAT TRANSITION

00:17:56.008 --> 00:18:00.179
OCCURS. WHEN THINGS POSSIBLE-

00:18:00.245 --> 00:18:03.348
SO THAT THAT IS AGAIN A LARGE

00:18:03.415 --> 00:18:06.018
COMPONENT OF WHERE WE NEED TO-

00:18:06.084 --> 00:18:07.986

ARE THE ISSUES YOU'RE GOING TO

00:18:38.984 --> 00:18:44.756

TAKING ON THE CHALLENGES MY

00:18:55.701 --> 00:18:58.670
COLLEAGUE SENATOR LAIRD SAID-

00:18:58.737 --> 00:18:59.805
FOR THE NEXT TWO YEARS WHILE

00:18:59.872 --> 00:19:02.007
THEY CLOSE DOWN THE DJJ SYSTEM

00:19:02.074 --> 00:19:04.243
AND- YOU HAVE A BIG JOB IN

00:19:04.309 --> 00:19:05.377
FRONT OF THE LIKE HE SAID TO

00:19:05.444 --> 00:19:06.712
KEEP STAFF AND TO MAKE SURE

00:19:06.778 --> 00:19:10.716
THAT- ED THESE INDIVIDUALS GET

00:19:10.782 --> 00:19:12.518
PUT IN A FACILITIES IN THE

00:19:12.584 --> 00:19:14.286
COUNTY LEVEL THAT ARE- THE MORE

00:19:14.353 --> 00:19:16.522
THAN ADEQUATE ADD TO MEET THE

00:19:16.588 --> 00:19:18.257
NEEDS THAT THEY HAVE. SO I DO

00:19:18.323 --> 00:19:20.993
HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS-

00:19:21.059 --> 00:19:22.461
WHAT COORDINATION DIFFERENCES

00:19:22.528 --> 00:19:24.429
DJJ ESTABLISHING TO ENSURE

00:19:24.496 --> 00:19:26.265
COUNTIES ARE PROPERLY PREPARED

00:19:26.331 --> 00:19:27.533
TO HOUSE EDUCATE AND PROVIDE

00:19:27.599 --> 00:19:28.667

RETURNED TO THE CUSTODY. TO

00:19:31.236 --> 00:19:32.971
THEIR CONSTITUENTS DJJ CLOSES.

00:19:33.038 --> 00:19:34.940
REASON WHY I ASK THIS. IS

00:19:35.007 --> 00:19:36.308
BECAUSE JUSTIN BUDGET A FEW

00:19:36.375 --> 00:19:38.210
MINUTES AGO EARLIER TODAY WE

00:19:38.277 --> 00:19:39.611
HEARD THE BUDGET BILL AND THAT

00:19:39.678 --> 00:19:40.913
BILL ACTUALLY HAD TWO DATES

00:19:40.979 --> 00:19:43.148
THAT WERE SIGNIFICANT. THE JULY

00:19:43.215 --> 00:19:44.650
FIRST TWENTY TWENTY THREE DATE

00:19:44.716 --> 00:19:45.817
THAT SAYS COUNTIES HAVE TO BE

00:19:45.884 --> 00:19:48.186
READY AND HAVE- EITHER HAVE

00:19:48.253 --> 00:19:50.222
BUILT FACILITIES OR ESTABLISH A

00:19:50.289 --> 00:19:52.324
PLACE FOR THESE. THESE YOU'VE

00:19:52.391 --> 00:19:54.960
TO GO. AND THEN IT ALSO SAID

00:19:55.027 --> 00:19:56.628
THAT ON JULY EIGHTH HE'S ME

00:19:56.695 --> 00:19:58.230

00:19:58.297 --> 00:19:59.264
FOR THAT DATE IN JULY TWENTY

00:19:59.331 --> 00:20:02.467
FIRST HE'S ME JULY FIRST.

00:20:02.534 --> 00:20:03.035
TWENTY TWENTY THREE FOR THE

00:20:03.101 --> 00:20:03.635
SECOND DAY WHICH IS THE SAME

00:20:03.702 --> 00:20:05.604
DATE. THAT THE GUIDELINES WOULD

00:20:05.671 --> 00:20:07.306
BE ESTABLISHED SOME A LITTLE

00:20:07.372 --> 00:20:08.874
CONCERNED HOW PEOPLE WOULD WORK

00:20:08.941 --> 00:20:09.508
TOGETHER ON THE GROUND TO MAKE

00:20:09.575 --> 00:20:11.877
SURE THAT THESE. AND YOU'D HAVE

A PLACE TO GO THAT MEET THE

00:20:13.412 --> 00:20:14.780
GUIDELINES BUT YET THEY'RE

00:20:14.846 --> 00:20:16.315
REQUIRED TO HAVE IT READY BY

00:20:16.381 --> 00:20:17.916
THE TIME THE GUIDELINES ARE

RECIDIVISM RATES ARE BETTER.

00:22:11.596 --> 00:22:14.666
AND REFLECT BETTER OUTCOMES NOW

00:22:14.733 --> 00:22:18.103
BECAUSE OF THAT ROLL OUT- I

00:22:18.170 --> 00:22:19.504
THINK I WOULD APPRECIATE THAT

00:22:19.571 --> 00:22:21.073
QUESTION IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT

00:22:21.139 --> 00:22:23.475
QUESTION I HAVE- ONE THING I

00:22:23.542 --> 00:22:24.843
WILL SAY THAT YOU KNOW THE

00:22:24.910 --> 00:22:26.845
CHALLENGE WITH RECIDIVISM DATA

00:22:26.912 --> 00:22:28.980
IS ALWAYS THAT. YOU HAVE TO

00:22:29.047 --> 00:22:31.216
FOLLOW A COURT FOR NUMBER OF

00:22:31.283 --> 00:22:32.884
YEARS USUALLY FIVE YEARS TO

00:22:32.951 --> 00:22:34.853
THEN BE ABLE TO LOOK AT. THOSE

00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:36.955
RECIDIVISM RATES AND SO ONE OF

00:22:37.022 --> 00:22:38.690
THE CHALLENGES WE'VE HAD A DJ

00:22:38.757 --> 00:22:40.826
IN TERMS OF THOSE QUESTIONS

00:22:40.892 --> 00:22:43.228
SURROUNDING THE IBM MODEL- AN

00:22:43.295 --> 00:22:45.964
IMPORTANT QUESTIONS. ARE THAT

00:22:46.031 --> 00:22:48.767
THE RECIDIVISM OUTCOMES WE-

00:22:48.834 --> 00:22:51.236
THAT THE LAST REPORT WAS

00:22:51.303 --> 00:22:52.270
PUBLISHED IN TWO THOUSAND AND

00:22:52.337 --> 00:22:55.974
NINETEEN. IT WAS AT THIRTEEN

00:22:56.041 --> 00:22:58.944
THE- TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN. TO

00:22:59.010 --> 00:23:01.747
FOURTEEN I'M SORRY YOU THOUSAND

00:23:01.813 --> 00:23:02.881
FOURTEEN TO FIFTEEN CO COURT

00:23:02.948 --> 00:23:05.717
AND SO EVEN THAT COHORT WAS NOT

00:23:05.784 --> 00:23:07.219
YET A COHORT THAT HAD GONE

00:23:07.285 --> 00:23:09.187
THROUGH ALL OF THE COMPONENTS

00:23:09.254 --> 00:23:12.324
AT THE END OF THE IV TìM. SO

00:23:12.390 --> 00:23:14.059
WITNESS RECIDIVISM DATA THIS

00:23:14.126 --> 00:23:16.862
PARTICULAR YEAR- IT WAS YOU

00:23:16.928 --> 00:23:19.831
KNOW- SAID THREE YEAR

00:23:19.898 --> 00:23:23.268
CONVICTION RATE WAS. AROUND 50%

00:23:23.335 --> 00:23:24.970
THAT'S OBVIOUSLY WE WANT BETTER

00:23:25.036 --> 00:23:27.639
THAN THAT- AND SO ONE OF THE

00:23:27.706 --> 00:23:30.776
THINGS THAT WE HAD DONE- ROUND

00:23:30.842 --> 00:23:33.912
I BELIEVE IT WAS. THAT TWO

00:23:33.979 --> 00:23:34.479
THOUSAND EIGHTEEN MAYBE TWO

00:23:34.546 --> 00:23:36.848
THOUSAND AND NINETEEN IS- ALSO

00:23:36.915 --> 00:23:38.316
WORK WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF

00:23:38.383 --> 00:23:41.253
IRVINE. YOU NOT ONLY LOOK AT

00:23:41.319 --> 00:23:43.155
HOW WELL THE BABY TìM IS

00:23:43.221 --> 00:23:44.890
WORKING IN TERMS OF RECIDIVISM

00:23:44.956 --> 00:23:47.159
RATES BUT CAN WE LOOK AT THE

00:23:47.225 --> 00:23:49.394
INDIVIDUAL COMPONENTS. ONE OF

00:23:49.461 --> 00:23:51.263
THE THINGS THAT OF RECIDIVISM

00:23:51.329 --> 00:23:53.665
PERCENTAGE DOESN'T TELL ME IS

00:23:53.732 --> 00:23:55.367
FOR THOSE THAT RECENT EVADED.

00:23:55.433 --> 00:23:57.969
WHY WAS THERE A COMMON REASON

00:23:58.036 --> 00:23:59.271
WHAT PROGRAMMING THAT THEY

00:23:59.337 --> 00:24:01.039
RECEIVE WHAT RISK LEVELS THAT

00:24:01.106 --> 00:24:02.774
THEY HAVE DID WE HELP DECREASE

00:24:02.841 --> 00:24:04.476
THOSE RISKS LEVELS SO WE WERE

00:24:04.543 --> 00:24:05.744
WORKING WITH THE UNIVERSITY

00:24:05.811 --> 00:24:09.080
YEAR IRVINE ON. A MULTI FACETED

00:24:09.147 --> 00:24:11.683
THAT STUDY TO LOOK AT ALL OF

00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:13.485
THOSE COMPONENTS AS WELL SO

00:24:13.552 --> 00:24:14.953
THEIR INITIAL ONE WAS TO DO

00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:18.390
THAT PROGRAM EVALUATION- AND

00:24:18.456 --> 00:24:21.893
THAT WAS- PUBLISHED IN MARCH OF

00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:24.329
TWENTY TWENTY- STATE THAT

00:24:24.396 --> 00:24:26.431
RECOGNIZE THAT IT APPEARED THAT

00:24:26.498 --> 00:24:29.467
THE IV TìM WAS. AN EVIDENCE

00:24:29.534 --> 00:24:33.505
BASED MODEL- BEAR WITH THE USED

00:24:33.572 --> 00:24:35.740
AS THAT THEY HAD KNOWLEDGE THAT

00:24:35.807 --> 00:24:37.609
THE STAFF BELIEVED IN THE MODEL

00:24:37.676 --> 00:24:39.878
THE VIEWS STATED THAT THEY FELT

00:24:39.945 --> 00:24:41.012
THEY WERE GETTING THE PROGRAMS

00:24:41.079 --> 00:24:42.280
THAT THEY NEEDED AT ALL

00:24:42.347 --> 00:24:43.915
DIFFERENT SERVICE LEVELS. THERE

00:24:43.982 --> 00:24:46.084
WERE- SUGGESTIONS THAT THEY

00:24:46.151 --> 00:24:47.719
MADE FOR NEXT STEPS IN TERMS OF

00:24:47.786 --> 00:24:49.788
THE FIDELITY AND STAFFING.

00:24:49.855 --> 00:24:50.989
MAKING SURE STAFFING VACANCIES

00:24:51.056 --> 00:24:58.129
RUBBER. PART OF THAT BUT- I

00:24:58.196 --> 00:24:58.730
THINK THOSE ARE ALL IMPORTANT

00:24:58.797 --> 00:24:59.331
COMPONENTS WHEN YOU WHEN YOU

00:24:59.397 --> 00:25:00.632
TALK ABOUT PURSUE. AND VALUE.

00:25:00.699 --> 00:25:03.468
THE WHETHER A PROGRAM ON A LIST.

00:25:03.535 --> 00:25:06.071
THANK THAT'S VERY GOOD- I JUST

00:25:06.137 --> 00:25:07.906
CAN I CLARIFY ON THE NUMBERS

00:25:07.973 --> 00:25:09.441
THAT YOU GAVE ME YOU HAD A

00:25:09.507 --> 00:25:11.543
FIFTY PERCENT- RECIDIVISM RATE

00:25:11.610 --> 00:25:14.246
WAS NOT ON THE FIFTEEN SIXTEEN

00:25:14.312 --> 00:25:17.449
NUMBERS OR WAS THAT ON THE-

00:25:17.515 --> 00:25:18.416
FOURTEEN FIFTEEN NUMBER EARTH.

00:25:18.483 --> 00:25:21.386
ALL FOURTEEN FIFTEEN FOURTEEN

00:25:21.453 --> 00:25:23.054
FIFTEEN OKAY SO THE FIFTEEN

00:25:23.121 --> 00:25:24.022
SIXTEEN NUMBER SHOULD COME OUT

00:25:24.089 --> 00:25:27.259
I'M PRETTY SOON- WHEN DOES THAT

00:25:27.325 --> 00:25:29.594
REPORT EXPECT TO BE RELEASED-

00:25:29.661 --> 00:25:33.531
I. AM NOT- I DON'T KNOW FOR

00:25:33.598 --> 00:25:34.866
SURE BUT THAT IS SOMETHING WE

00:25:34.933 --> 00:25:36.401
COULD BUY COULD FIND OUT FOR

00:25:36.468 --> 00:25:38.370
YOU. OKAY GREAT STATE THANK YOU

00:25:38.436 --> 00:25:39.404
THANK YOU VERY MUCH I

APPRECIATE YOU LETTING ME ASK

00:25:42.274 --> 00:25:42.807
THESE QUESTIONS I DO- I THINK

00:25:42.874 --> 00:25:45.143
THAT YOU KNOW IF AGAIN. IN THE

00:25:45.210 --> 00:25:46.544
REAL WORLD I'M A JOB CREATOR

00:25:46.611 --> 00:25:47.879
RIGHT I THINK A JOB IS THE BEST

00:25:47.946 --> 00:25:49.047
SOLUTION FOR PROPERTY OR

00:25:49.114 --> 00:25:50.048
SOMEBODY TO STAY OUT OF TROUBLE

00:25:50.115 --> 00:25:51.716
OR STAFF THE STREETS OR-

00:25:51.783 --> 00:25:53.385
PROVIDE FOR THEIR FAMILIES I

00:25:53.451 --> 00:25:54.152
MEAN YOU NAME IT THE JOB IS AN

00:25:54.219 --> 00:25:56.922
ANSWER IN. AN M. IT WAS YEARS

00:25:56.988 --> 00:25:58.423
AGO BUT WE FORMED AN ALLIANCE

00:25:58.490 --> 00:25:59.157
WITH THE CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY

00:25:59.224 --> 00:26:01.192
PATROL OFFICE IN THE COMMANDER-

00:26:01.259 --> 00:26:03.628
IN BAKERSFIELD. A LOUDEST USE A

00:26:03.695 --> 00:26:05.563
CHP OFFICER ONE HOUR A WEEK TO

00:26:05.630 --> 00:26:07.532
MENTOR- AT RISK YOUTH THAT CAME

00:26:07.599 --> 00:26:08.867
FROM. THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:26:08.934 --> 00:26:10.001
JUVENILE JUSTICE IT WAS

00:26:10.068 --> 00:26:10.835
ACTUALLY PRETTY INTERESTING

00:26:10.902 --> 00:26:13.104
PROGRAM THAT WE DID- AND THE

00:26:13.171 --> 00:26:13.972
REASON WHY I BRING IT UP IS

00:26:14.039 --> 00:26:16.474
BECAUSE THOSE GROUP DOES USE

00:26:16.541 --> 00:26:17.876
THAT WENT THROUGH IT NOW.

00:26:17.943 --> 00:26:19.311
PREVIOUSLY INCARCERATED GOING

00:26:19.377 --> 00:26:21.179
TO THE PROGRAM. I WITHOUT THE

00:26:21.246 --> 00:26:22.580
PARTNERSHIP WITH C. H. P. WOULD

00:26:22.647 --> 00:26:23.882
BE BENEFICIAL BECAUSE A LOT OF

00:26:23.949 --> 00:26:27.452
TIMES- THAT COMMUNITY AS- THE

00:26:27.519 --> 00:26:28.987
COMMUNITY THAT COMES FROM THAT

00:26:29.054 --> 00:26:31.056
TYPE OF AREA AND THAT-

00:26:31.122 --> 00:26:34.693
ENVIRONMENT. AND BEING IN

00:26:34.759 --> 00:26:35.527
PRISON DOESN'T HAVE A LOT OF-

00:26:35.593 --> 00:26:36.861
OR THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEMS

00:26:36.928 --> 00:26:38.029
AND A LOT OF POSITIVE INTERTEK

00:26:38.096 --> 00:26:39.331
INTERACT AND WITH THE POLICE

00:26:39.397 --> 00:26:40.932
OFFICERS. INTO THIS GAVE THE

00:26:40.999 --> 00:26:42.534
POLICE OFFICERS AN OPPORTUNITY

00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:45.303
TO MENTOR. TEACH YOU KNOW SPEND

00:26:45.370 --> 00:26:47.072
TIME WITH THEM M. GET TO KNOW

00:26:47.138 --> 00:26:47.872
THEIR LIFESTYLE AND WHO THEY

00:26:47.939 --> 00:26:48.974
ARE AND WHERE THEY CAME FROM

00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:51.309
AND- AND THEN TO SHOW THESE USE

00:26:51.376 --> 00:26:52.243
THAT THERE'S SOMETHING BETTER

00:26:52.310 --> 00:26:53.545
OUT THERE THAN WHAT THEY'RE-

00:26:53.611 --> 00:26:54.946
DOING. ON THE STREET OR GET

00:26:55.013 --> 00:26:56.581
DOING TO GET INTO IT DO YOU

00:26:56.648 --> 00:26:58.049
KNOW JUSTICE SYSTEM. AND THEN

00:26:58.116 --> 00:26:59.451
IT WAS A GREAT SUCCESS AND I

00:26:59.517 --> 00:27:00.819
HATED TO SEE THAT PROGRAM GO

00:27:00.885 --> 00:27:03.321
AWAY- BUT IT DID- AND IONLY

00:27:03.388 --> 00:27:04.189
BRING IT UP BECAUSE IT WAS JUST

00:27:04.255 --> 00:27:05.523
YESTERDAY THAT I GOT A TEXT

00:27:05.590 --> 00:27:06.925
MESSAGE FROM AN INDIVIDUAL THAT

00:27:06.992 --> 00:27:07.959
WAS SHARING WITH ME THAT HE'S

00:27:08.026 --> 00:27:09.828
MARRIED NOW AND HAVING A BABY.

00:27:09.894 --> 00:27:11.629
AND HE WAS ONE OF THE ONES THAT

00:27:11.696 --> 00:27:13.231
WE WERE REALLY WORRIED ABOUT

00:27:13.298 --> 00:27:13.798
THAT WAS GOING TO RESET YOU

00:27:13.865 --> 00:27:15.734
KNOW. GO BACK TO YOU. THAT AND

00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:17.168
HE'S- DOING VERY VERY WELL SO

00:27:17.235 --> 00:27:18.003
IT JUST MADE ME THINK THAT IT'S

00:27:18.069 --> 00:27:19.037
JUST IRONIC THAT YOUR

00:27:19.104 --> 00:27:20.271
CONFIRMATION OR IS IT TODAY

00:27:20.338 --> 00:27:21.373
AND- I THOUGHT IT WAS A GREAT

00:27:21.439 --> 00:27:23.041
PROGRAM AND I KNOW YOU PROBABLY

00:27:23.108 --> 00:27:23.842
WANT AROUND WHEN THAT WAS

00:27:23.908 --> 00:27:25.677
AUTHORIZED BUT- I THINK WE NEED

00:27:25.744 --> 00:27:26.778
TO GO BACK TO PROGRAMS LIKE

00:27:26.845 --> 00:27:29.314
THAT. BECAUSE THE KIDS LEARNED

00:27:29.381 --> 00:27:31.750
A LOT. I MEAN WE SEE. ONE HOPE

00:27:31.816 --> 00:27:32.917
TO LESSER WAS CONSTRUCTION.

00:27:32.984 --> 00:27:35.053
BUILDER A BUILDER OF HOMES AND-

00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:37.389
AND THEN. YOU KNOW YOU JUST

00:27:37.455 --> 00:27:38.790
THINK THAT WHEN YOU WORK WITH.

00:27:38.857 --> 00:27:39.958
WILL PEOPLE KNOW AND UNDERSTAND

00:27:40.025 --> 00:27:41.526
WHAT YOU MEAN AND HE SAID THE

00:27:41.593 --> 00:27:42.594
KID IS GOING TO BE THAT IMPACT

00:27:42.660 --> 00:27:44.195
WRENCH. IN THE KID WENT TO THE

00:27:44.262 --> 00:27:45.764
TRACK FOR LIKE TEN MINUTES IN

00:27:45.830 --> 00:27:46.865
THE SPEECH PAVE SIR GOT A

00:27:46.931 --> 00:27:47.899
LITTLE FRUSTRATED WHATEVER GOES

00:27:47.966 --> 00:27:49.300
WHAT'S MATTER. AND THE KID IS

00:27:49.367 --> 00:27:51.069
FRANTICALLY. TRYING TO FIGURE

00:27:51.136 --> 00:27:52.404
OUT IN GOOGLE WHAT IMPACT

00:27:52.470 --> 00:27:53.905
WRENCHES RIGHT AND FIND IT WITH

00:27:53.972 --> 00:27:55.774
ALL THE TOOLS IN THE BACK. AND

00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:57.275
THEN THE OFFICERS TOOK IT A

00:27:57.342 --> 00:27:58.777
LITTLE BIT OF TIME EXPLAINED

00:27:58.843 --> 00:28:00.478
ALL THAT PROCESS AND WHAT THESE

00:28:00.545 --> 00:28:01.079
WORDS AND THEY KIND OF DID A

00:28:01.146 --> 00:28:02.914
QUIZ TEST NAY. DID SOME

00:28:02.981 --> 00:28:04.382
DRAWINGS ON WHERE THE TOOLS ARE

00:28:04.449 --> 00:28:06.584
STORED IN SO. AND THAT'S THAT

00:28:06.651 --> 00:28:08.720
YOUNG MAN IS NOW LEAD MECHANIC

00:28:08.787 --> 00:28:09.387
FOR ONE OF THE OIL FIELD

00:28:09.454 --> 00:28:10.688
SERVICE SUPPORTERS COMPANIES

00:28:10.755 --> 00:28:12.357
THAT WE HAVE IN KERN COUNTY SO.

00:28:12.424 --> 00:28:13.158
I THINK IT WAS A VERY

00:28:13.224 --> 00:28:15.560
SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM AND- I THINK

00:28:15.627 --> 00:28:16.761
THAT WE NEED MORE PROGRAMS LIKE

00:28:16.828 --> 00:28:17.829
THAT TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE

00:28:17.896 --> 00:28:18.997
YOUTH DON'T RE OFFEND. THEY

00:28:19.064 --> 00:28:20.198
DON'T GO BACK TO THE- SAME

00:28:20.265 --> 00:28:21.366
PLACE WITH THE SAME PEOPLE

00:28:21.433 --> 00:28:22.767
THAT. AND IF THEY DO GO BACK

00:28:22.834 --> 00:28:23.768
THEN THEIRSTAND THEY STRONG

00:28:23.835 --> 00:28:25.570
STAND ENOUGH THIS STRONG. SENSE

00:28:25.637 --> 00:28:27.906
WRONGNESS. TO AND SAY I'M

WE'RE NOT REALLY THINKING

00:30:00.965 --> 00:30:02.834

OF A SEX REGISTRY AND THE EASE

WITH WHICH WE LIKE TO LABEL

00:32:55.006 --> 00:32:57.175
FOLK SEXUAL OFFENDERS IN THE

00:32:57.241 --> 00:32:58.710

FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT A GOOD

00:33:02.747 --> 00:33:04.082
NUMBER OF THOSE FOLKS HAVE ALSO

00:33:04.148 --> 00:33:05.583
BEEN VICTIMIZED OFTENTIMES

00:33:05.650 --> 00:33:08.786
VICTIMIZED- DURING THEIR YOUTH-

00:33:08.853 --> 00:33:10.655
SEXUALLY VICTIMIZED. WHICH

00:33:10.722 --> 00:33:13.291
LEADS TO SOME OF THE- BEHAVIOR

00:33:13.358 --> 00:33:15.059
THAT THEY END UP- BEING

00:33:15.126 --> 00:33:17.261
INVOLVED IN AND- YOU KNOW

00:33:17.328 --> 00:33:20.331

LITTLE BIT ABOUT- YOU KNOW THE

00:33:24.102 --> 00:33:25.236
FOLKS THAT ARE IN THERE THE

00:33:25.303 --> 00:33:27.004
YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE IN THEIR-

THE SEXUAL BEHAVIOR TREATMENT-

00:33:34.812 --> 00:33:36.013
BECAUSE I DO BELIEVE THAT THAT

00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:38.516
IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT- AS WE

00:33:38.583 --> 00:33:40.585
TALK ABOUT REHABILITATION AS WE

00:33:40.651 --> 00:33:42.286
TALK ABOUT SORT OF RE ENTRY AS

00:33:42.353 --> 00:33:44.555
WE TALK ABOUT THE HEALING- BUT

00:33:44.622 --> 00:33:45.523
ALSO AS WE TALK ABOUT LIKE DE

00:33:45.590 --> 00:33:47.191
STIGMATIZING AND CREATING

00:33:47.258 --> 00:33:49.394
DIFFERENT PATHWAYS- FOR FOLKS

00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:52.163
TO BE- RECEIVED AND VIEWED-

00:33:52.230 --> 00:33:53.297
THIS IS IT'S SOMETHINGTHAT'S

00:33:53.364 --> 00:33:58.336
VERY HARD TO- HI- NOT BE

00:33:58.403 --> 00:33:59.737
ASSOCIATED WITH IT HAS LIFE

00:33:59.804 --> 00:34:03.141
LONG IMPLICATIONS- AND- I. SO

00:34:03.207 --> 00:34:03.975
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THAT BUT

00:34:04.041 --> 00:34:05.443
WOULD LOVE FOR YOU TO SHARE. A

00:34:05.510 --> 00:34:07.211
LITTLE BIT ABOUT- THAT PROGRAM

00:34:07.278 --> 00:34:09.180
AND HOW THAT'S BEEN AFFECTED

00:34:09.247 --> 00:34:12.750
FOR THE YOUNG FOLKS. ABSOLUTELY

00:34:12.817 --> 00:34:15.453
AND THIS IS. A PROGRAM THAT'S

00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:18.322
VERY VERY CLOSE TO MY HEART- I

00:34:18.389 --> 00:34:20.658
WORKED FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS-

00:34:20.725 --> 00:34:22.860
ALONG WITH OUR STAFF TO. MAKE

00:34:22.927 --> 00:34:24.395
SURE THAT WE ARE PROVIDING THE

00:34:24.462 --> 00:34:25.496
TREATMENT THAT WAS APPROPRIATE

00:34:25.563 --> 00:34:27.799
TO THIS POPULATION- I FIRST

00:34:27.865 --> 00:34:29.367
WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE AND I THINK

00:34:29.434 --> 00:34:32.336
IT'S- ALSO INCREDIBLY

00:34:32.403 --> 00:34:33.604
IMPORTANT. BECAUSE OF THEM.

00:34:33.671 --> 00:34:34.505
WHAT WAS THAT AT THE VERY

00:34:34.572 --> 00:34:35.506
BEGINNING OF THIS YEAR AND

00:34:35.573 --> 00:34:37.375
THAT- YOU KNOW THIS IS AN

00:34:37.442 --> 00:34:40.411
IMPORTANT AND DIFFICULT TOPIC-

00:34:40.478 --> 00:34:41.813
TO DISCUSS BECAUSE IT DOES

00:34:41.879 --> 00:34:42.580
TRIGGER A LOT OF DIFFERENT

00:34:42.647 --> 00:34:44.015
EMOTIONS AND INDIVIDUALS FOR

00:34:44.081 --> 00:34:45.783
MANY DIFFERENT REASONS. AND SO

00:34:45.850 --> 00:34:46.984
I WANT TO CLARIFY THAT WHEN

00:34:47.051 --> 00:34:48.386
WE'RE DISCUSSING THE TREATMENT

00:34:48.453 --> 00:34:51.255
THAT THE ISSUE FOR ME THAT- IT

00:34:51.322 --> 00:34:54.025
AND OF YOU TO HAVE IT WITH

00:34:54.091 --> 00:34:56.227
SEXUAL ABUSE OF BEHAVIOR- IT'S

00:34:56.294 --> 00:34:57.895
NOT INTENDEDTO MINIMIZE THE

00:34:57.962 --> 00:34:58.930
HARM EXPERIENCED BY THE

00:34:58.996 --> 00:35:01.432
SURVIVORS OF SEXUAL ABUSE. AND

00:35:01.499 --> 00:35:03.468
THESE CRIMES AS WELL AS YOU

00:35:03.534 --> 00:35:04.368
KNOW THE BEHAVIORS THAT

00:35:04.435 --> 00:35:06.437
OCCURRED SO- I JUST NEEDED TO

00:35:06.504 --> 00:35:09.073
SAY THAT FROM THE BEGINNING-

00:35:09.140 --> 00:35:10.374
WHEN WE DEVELOPED A SEXUAL

00:35:10.441 --> 00:35:12.076
BEHAVIOR TREATMENT PROGRAM AND

00:35:12.143 --> 00:35:14.045
THIS WAS- WE IMPLEMENTED THE

00:35:14.111 --> 00:35:15.613
NEW CURRICULUM IN TWO THOUSAND

00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:17.081
TWELVE SO I I'D LIKE TO SEE

00:35:17.148 --> 00:35:18.049
THAT I WANTED KNOWLEDGE TO YOU

00:35:18.115 --> 00:35:20.251
AS A- IN A FIELD WE'VE COME A

00:35:20.318 --> 00:35:21.452
LONG WAY FROM WHEN I FIRST

00:35:21.519 --> 00:35:22.753
STARTED. RESEARCHING THIS AND

00:35:22.820 --> 00:35:24.222
LOOKING AT YOU YOU KNOW WHAT WE

00:35:24.288 --> 00:35:25.957
NEED TO PROVIDE FOR EACH YEAR.

00:35:26.023 --> 00:35:27.225
IT'S IMPORTANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE

00:35:27.291 --> 00:35:28.426
THAT WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

00:35:28.493 --> 00:35:30.862
JUVENILES WHO HAVE- WITH

00:35:30.928 --> 00:35:32.830
SEXUALLY ABUSIVE BEHAVIOR IS

00:35:32.897 --> 00:35:35.132
THAT THEY ARE NOT- THEY NEED TO

00:35:35.199 --> 00:35:37.368
BE TREATED DIFFERENTLY. THAT

00:35:37.435 --> 00:35:40.238
THEY DON'T HAVE THE RISKS- THAT

00:35:40.304 --> 00:35:42.206
YOUR ADULT OFFENDERS DO THEIR

00:35:42.273 --> 00:35:43.975
DIFFERENT RISKS AND MOST

00:35:44.041 --> 00:35:46.878
IMPORTANTLY THE RECIDIVISM RATE

00:35:46.944 --> 00:35:49.547
FOR SEXUAL OFFENSES IS LOW FOR

00:35:49.614 --> 00:35:52.917
THIS POPULATION SO- FOR YEARS

00:35:52.984 --> 00:35:55.086
THE FIELD HAS- THAT. REVAMPS

00:35:55.152 --> 00:35:56.521
I'VE FOUND THIS OVER AND OVER

00:35:56.587 --> 00:35:58.489
AGAIN AND RESEARCH BOTH THEM

00:35:58.556 --> 00:36:00.525
THROUGH SINGLE RESEARCH AS WELL

00:36:00.591 --> 00:36:02.393
AS MATT AND ALICE'S THAT

00:36:02.460 --> 00:36:04.128
TYPICALLY THIS POPULATION WILL

00:36:52.977 --> 00:36:54.679
AND I EVEN WANT TO HIGHLIGHT

00:36:54.745 --> 00:36:55.713

KIND OF HOW CELEBRATE THESE

00:37:10.227 --> 00:37:11.095
