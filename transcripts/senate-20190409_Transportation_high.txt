YOU. MEMBERS -- WILL OPERATE AS A COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE UNTIL WE REACH A QUORUM THAT'LL TAKE ROLE -- AND WE LIKE TO SEE ALL THE MEMBERS COME TO THE MEETING -- WE'RE GONNA -- START THE HEARING AS A CLEAR THE WHOLE AND THEN WHEN I SEE MY ONE MORE MEMBER I WILL TAKE ROLAND. GOING TO ACTION SO THAT MEANS WE CAN VOTE ON STUFF FOR A ROLL CALL. SO -- WE LIKE PEOPLE TO PLEASE SO. TAKE THEIR CONVERSATIONS OUTSIDE TURN OFF CELL PHONES OF COURSE -- AND WE'RE GOING TO HEAR A LOT OF BILLS TODAY SO WE WANT TO LIMIT OUR TESTIMONY TO TWO WITNESSES PER SIDE. TWO MINUTES PER WITNESS -- AND WITH THAT I THINK WAS A COMMUTER HOLE START WITH -- CENTER PORTANTINO -- HE HAS ONE BILL THIS IS ITEM NUMBER ONE SB. SEVEN ANSWER YOU OF THE 40%. THANK YOU -- I HAVE A NUMBER OF THE LOBBY. IN EACH CHAPTER -- ONE IF YOU WILL YEAH [inaudible] YEAH. FOUR OKAY. ONE EIGHTY YEAH THANK YOU YEAH OKAY. AMAZON IN FACT I'LL GIVE THEM A MINUTE AND A HALF. SO THEM A LITTLE MORE TIME SINCE SO. THIS IS BEEN A SIXTY YEAR STRUGGLE. YES YES YOU BROUGHT IN A THANK YOU. ONE PERSON ARE YOU OF THE FOR CENTER THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE MEMBERS. THEY ARE PRESENTING THE SEVEN WHICH PROHIBITS CALTRANS FROM CONSTRUCTING A FREEWAY TUNNEL SURFACE OR EXPRESSWAY. TUNNEL BETWEEN THE SEVEN TEN I TEN AND THE TWO TEN FOR THE SEVEN TEN FREEWAY AS THE CHAIR AND I JUST TALKED ABOUT. THIS IS BEEN A SIXTY YEAR STRUGGLE EARLIER IN THE YEAR CALTRANS CERTIFIED THE FINAL THE I. R.. WHICH ESSENTIALLY -- HAS THE STATE GOING IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION AFTER SEVERAL YEARS OF COMMUNITY CHARETTE OUTREACH -- AND DISCUSSIONS CALTRANS AND METRO DETERMINE THAT THE TUNNEL WAS NOT THE PREFERRED ALTERNATIVE THAT A SERIES OF LOCAL TRAFFIC IMPROVEMENTS -- WHICH IS CALLED THE TSM. TSM TDM -- IS THE PREFERRED ALTERNATIVE IN THE FINALLY I OURS WAS QUITE EXCITING WE HAD THE CALTRANS -- DEPARTMENT TRANSPORTATION SECRETARY DOWN IN THE DISTRICT. TO HAND OVER THE FINALLY I ARE. DECLARING AN END TO THE THREAT OF THE TUNNEL -- THAT'S THE GOOD NEWS -- WHAT THAT DOES IS IT PRESENTS AN OPPORTUNITY NOW TO DISPOSE OF THE OVER FOUR HUNDRED PARCELS OF LAND? THAT CALTRANS HAD ACQUIRED OVER THE LAST THIRTY YEARS WHEN THEY HAD DESIGNS AND DOING A SURFACE ROUTEMANY OF THOSE CALTRANS TENANTS OR A HANDFUL OF THOSE CALTRANS TENETS ARE NON PROFITS. AND SO THIS BILL DOES THREE THINGS HEY IT DELETES THE SEVEN TEN FROM THE STREETS AND HIGHWAYS CODE WHICH IS NO LONGER NEEDED BECAUSE THE I. R.. DETERMINE THAT THE PROJECT WAS NO LONGER FEASIBLE. TO IT ALLOWS THOSE LONG STANDING NON PROFITS TO PURCHASE THERE ARE PROPERTIES FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AT THE CURRENT USE SO FOR EXAMPLE SEQUOYAH SCHOOL WHICH WE HAVE TO STUDENTS HERE TO TESTIFY HAS BEEN OPERATING AS A SCHOOL FOR HOW MANY YEARS.SIXTY YEARS AS A TENET OF THIS AREA AND SO THIS BILL ALLOWS THEM TO PURCHASE THEIR PROPERTY AT THE USE FOR A SCHOOL. NOT FOR THE USE FOR MANSIONS -- RONALD MCDONALD HOUSE HAS BEEN HELPING FAMILIES IN NEED OF CARE BECAUSE IT'S ADJACENT TO HUNTINGTON HOSPITAL. FOR DECADES AGAIN IT ALLOWS RONALD MCDONALD HOUSE TO PURCHASE THEIR PROPERTY FOR THE USE OF A NON PROFIT HEALTH FACILITY NOT. FOR THE USE AS A MANSION -- THE ARLINGTON GARDEN IS A BEAUTIFUL BOTANICAL GARDEN THAT IS BEEN OPERATING AS A TENANT FOR MANY MANY YEARS IT ALLOWS ARLINGTON GARDEN TO PURCHASE THEIR PROPERTY FOR THE USES AS A GARDEN. NOT FOR MANSION SO WE THINK THAT'S A COMMON SENSE SOLUTION TO THESE NONPROFITS THAT HAVE BEEN SERVING THE COMMUNITIES -- SO WONDERFULLY FOR FOR DECADES AND WE THINK IT'S THE FAIR THING TO DO THE THIRD THING THE BILL. DOES IS IT LAYS THE FOUNDATION FOR ANY DISPOSITION OF THE NO LONGER NECESSARY FREEWAY STUBS. BACK TO THE CITIES IN WHICH THEY ARE IN THAT PIECE OF THE PUZZLE WE'RE WAITING FOR CALTRANS TO PROVIDE US. THE APPROPRIATE LANGUAGE BECAUSE FROM WHAT CALTRANS IS TOLD ME. WHETHER WE CALL IT SURPLUS IT'S ONE SECTION OF GOVERNMENT CODE ABANDONMENT IS ANOTHER SECTION OF GOVERNMENT CODE -- WHATEVER NOMENCLATURE IS USED GOVERNS HOW ALL THOSE IT IT'S A BIG DISH AND SO CALTRANS IS INTERNALLY REVIEWING HEY WHAT'S STUBS ARE NEEDED. TO MEET THE LOCAL TRANSPORTATION NEEDS AND BE. IF THINGS ARE NOT NEEDED HOW WE CAN FACILITATE GETTING THEM BACK INTO THE HANDS OF THE CITIES -- THE BILL DOES NOT DEAL WITH ANY OF THE RIVER FINANCIAL IMPACTS -- METRO IS PROGRAMMING THE DOLLARS LEFT OVER FROM MEASURE R. IN ANY DOLLARS THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY ALLOCATED. TOWARDS THE TUNNEL THEY'RE USING THOSE DOLLARS ON A LOCAL PLANNING PROCESS BEING SPEARHEADED BY A SUPERVISOR CATHY BARKER AND SUPERVISOR HILDA SOLELY SO THEY'RE WORKING WITH THE AFFECTED COMMUNITIES. ON HOW BEST TO USE THE RESOURCES T.. TO IMPLEMENT THE PREFERRED ALTERNATIVE AND MITIGATE ANY TRAFFIC CIRCULATION ISSUES. THAT ARE LINGERING SO THIS PROJECT THIS BILL DOES NOT DEAL WITH -- THE DISPOSITION OF THE FUNDS WE THANK AT ITS NECESSARY ONCE AND FOR ALL PUTS THE FINAL STAKE. IN THE HEART OF THE FREEWAY AND IS FAIR AND COMPASSIONATE TO THE NONPROFITS THAT CERTAINLY HAVE BEEN SERVING THE COMMUNITY SO WELL AND THEN AS I SAID WE'VE BEEN WORKING IN CONCERT WITH CALTRANS. ON THE APPROPRIATE LANGUAGE FOR THE DISPOSITION OF THE STOPS AND OBVIOUSLY WE DON'T HAVE THAT. BY SEPTEMBER WILL COME BACK IN JANUARY AND DEAL WITH THE STUBS STAND BUT WE HAVE IT BY SEPTEMBER. YOU KNOW AND OF COURSE THE CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE WILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW THAT LANGUAGE AND YOU KNOW WE'RE ALL WORKING -- IN CONCERT AND I WANT TO THANK AGAIN THE CHAIRS A CO AUTHOR OF THE BILL AND WITH THAT OF I CAN HAVE MY WITNESSES GO DOWN THE LINE. AND BE BRIEF. THANK YOU CENTER APPRECIATE THAT AND EACH ONE OF YOU HAVE A MINUTE OUT THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS ELIZABETH DEVER AND I'M THE DIRECTOR OF THE PASADENA RONALD MCDONALD HOUSE THE PASADENA RONALD MCDONALD HOUSE IS A HOME AWAY FROM HOME. FOR FAMILIES WHO HAVE CHILDREN WITH SERIOUS AND LIFE THREATENING ILLNESSES THEY COME TO PASADENA SEEKING MEDICAL CARE THAT THEY CANNOT RECEIVE CLOSER TO HOME. CHILDREN ARE TREATED AT LOCAL HOSPITALS FOR LIMB DEFICIENCIES ORGAN TRANSPLANTS -- ORTHOPEDIC CONDITIONS CANCER AND BURN SCARS OUR GOAL IS TO KEEP FAMILIES pMEDICAL CARE AND CLOSE TO ONE ANOTHER. SINCE OPENING IN TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR WE'VE SERVE MORE THAN TWENTY THREE THOUSAND CHILDREN AND THEIR FAMILIES. THE HOUSE IS LOCATED AND CALTRANS HOMES ACROSS THE STREET FROM HUNTINGTON HOSPITAL IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WE RAN OUT A HUNDRED AND 16% OCCUPANCY AND WE ARE CONSTANTLY TURNING FAMILIES AWAY. RIGHT NOW WE HAVE TWELVE BEDROOMS AND ARE ABLE TO HOUSE NINETEEN FAMILIES AT A TIME THAT MEANS THAT FAMILIES ARE WILLING TO DOUBLE UP IN ROOMS TO BE CLOSE TO THEIR CHILD'S MEDICAL CARE. RESEARCH SAYS THAT WE NEED THIRTY BEDROOMS TO MEET OUR CURRENT NEED SB SEVEN WILL ALLOW US TO EXPAND TO MEET THE NEEDS OF SICK CHILDREN AND THEIR FAMILIES THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. AFTERNOON MY NAME IS MEGAN FOCUSED ON THE CO CHAIR FOR THE BOARD OF THE PASSING AROUND THE DONALD HOUSE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME TODAY. OF FOR ALL OF THE AROUND THE DONALD HOUSES ACROSS THE WORLD ARE LOCATION IS MISSION CRITICAL WE NEED TO BE CLOSE TO OUR HOSPITAL PARTNERS. IN PASADENA WE ARE DIRECTLY ACROSS THE STREET FROM HUNTINGTON HOSPITAL WHERE SHORT -- WALK AWAY FROM SHRINERS HOSPITAL. SB SEVEN IT WILL ALLOW US -- TO IT WILL HELP KEEP THE PURCHASE PRICE WITHIN REACH FOR US WE REALLY DO NEED TO BE IN THESE -- PROPERTIES AND WITH THE HELP OF SB SEVEN WE'LL BE ABLE TO RAISE THOSE FUNDS TO THE COMMUNITY. IF WE CAN'T RAISE THE PURCHASE PRICE FOR THESE PROPERTIES THEY WILL BE SOLD AND AT THAT POINT WE WILL HAVE PRIDE HAVE TO LEAVE PASADENA SO -- ON BEHALF OF THE PASADENA ROAMING DONALD HOUSE WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS ALICIA BARKER VAUGHN AND I AM CURRENTLY A HIGH SCHOOL SENIOR AT SEQUOIA SCHOOL. THE JUNE I'LL BE PART OF THE FIRST PIONEERING CLASS OF THE GRADUATING SENIORS AT SEQUOIA I FEEL INCREDIBLY GRATEFUL TO HAVE TEACHERS WHO CHALLENGE ME INTELLECTUALLY WHILE ALSO GIVING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE WHAT I LEARNED IN THE CLASSROOM. AND APPLY IT TO MY COMMUNITY AND THE WORLD SO WHAT HAS PROVIDED ME AWAY TO BE A BETTER PERSON GIVE BACK TO MY COMMUNITY. AND OPEN THE DOORS OF BUSINESS AND SOCIAL JUSTICE TO ME AT SUCH A YOUNG AGE. AFTER BEING PLACED IN THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM I'D ALWAYS WANTED TO CHANGE TO HELP CHANGE THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR HIGHER EDUCATION THAT WERE OFFERED TO THE CHILDREN IN THE SYSTEM. THROUGH THE SOCIAL INNOVATION PROGRAM THAT'S A QUIZ HIGH SCHOOL I WAS PROVIDED A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO HELP CHANGE THE LIVES OF FOSTER YOUTH IN THE PASSING A UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. THROUGH MY NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS MARK YOUR FUTURE RUNNING I'M SORRY I'M RUNNING A NONPROFIT AT THE AGE OF SEVENTEEN HAS ALLOWED ME TO WORK ONE ON ONE WITH KIDS THAT HAVE BEEN THROUGH SIMILAR EXPERIENCES AS ME. THIS WOULD NOT HAVE OTHERWISE HAPPENED HAD I NOT GONE TO SEQUOIA I WILL NEVER FORGET MY HIGH SCHOOL YEARS AT SEQUOIA. WHEN I LEAVE FOR FOR FOR COLLEGE NEXT FALL I WILL BE TAKING WITH ME THE VALUES OF THE KOREA AND ON BEHALF OF THE ENTIRE STUDENT BODY? THANK YOU FOR SECURING THE FUTURE OF OUR SCHOOL WITH THE SUPPORT OF SB. SEVEN GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS DASCHLE GALLON AND I'M A FIFTH GRADER AT SCHOOL AND SCHOOL IN PASADENA MY SCHOOL IS A SPECIAL PLACE BECAUSE WE LEARN BY DOING. I HAVE ATTENDED SCHOOL IS SINCE KINDERGARTEN AGE OF MY TEACHERS TAUGHT A WIDE SUPPORT TO SPEAK UP AND BE AN ACTIVE CITIZEN IN YOUR COMMUNITY. I FEEL THANKFUL TO BE PART OF THE SCHOOL THAT LET ME PUT Y. LEARNING TO ACTION BY COMING TO SACRAMENTO TO TESTIFY BEFORE YOU TODAY. AT SCHOOL WHERE WE CELEBRATE MOREABOUT HUMAN DIGNITY ON A LOCAL AND GLOBAL LEVEL. THIS YEAR FOR EXAMPLE WE STUDIED THE POLICY TO LEGALIZE STREET MANY IN LOS ANGELES AND THE RIGHTS OF VENDORS TO WORK LEGALLY WITHOUT FEAR OR HER ASMAN. IN RECOGNITION OF THE SEVENTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF THE UNIVERSAL DECLARATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS. MY CLASSMATES AND I RESEARCHED AND ANALYZE THE FIRST INTERNATIONAL DOCUMENT SIGNED BY UNITED NATIONS RECOGNIZING OUR INALIENABLE RIGHTS AS HUMAN BEINGS. YOUR SUPPORT OF SB SEVEN WOULD SECURE FUTURE FOR MY SCHOOL SO THAT MORE STUDENTS. CAN BENEFIT FROM AN EDUCATION THAT CHALLENGES THE MIND SEARCHERS THE HEART AND SOUL RIGHT TO INDIGNITY THANK YOU. OF ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN FAVOR OF THE THIS -- BILL SB -- SEVEN GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHECK YOUR ROSS ON BEHALF THE CITY'S A PASADENA AND SOUTH PASADENA BOTH IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. GREAT THANK YOU. MY NAME IS RENEE DICK WILSON I'M A RESIDENT OF THE DISTRICT AND I'M IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL THANKS. MARIN PM WE HAVE THE CITY OF A HAMMER OUT WELL WE HAVE NO SUPPORT POSITION RIGHT THANK THE SENATOR FOR CONTINUED TO WORK WITH US. AS A WE'VE BEEN IN THIS COMMITTEE A NUMBER OF TIMES BEFORE SO WE LOOK TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS WITH YOU. SO THAT THE CITY OF A HAMMER ALSO REDUCES TRAFFIC ON THE STREETS WHICH IS MUCH MUCH NEEDED THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU [inaudible] OUR OWN. OTHER WITNESSES IN FAVOR IF NOT -- QUICK CALL THE WITNESSES OPPOSING THE BILL. OR HAVE QUESTIONS ANYBODY. OPPOSING THE BILL -- NOT NINE SEEN -- QUESTIONS FROM OUR COMMITTEE. DOES THE WE HAVE QUESTIONS. JUST A REMINDER RUBIO -- THE FOR THANK YOU JUST A REALLY BRIEF COMMENT -- FIRST WANTED THINK THE FIFTH GRADER IN ALL I TAUGHT FOR SEVENTEEN YEARS AND ALWAYS. MAKES ME REALLY HAPPY TO SEE COURAGEOUS YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN LIKE YOU JUST COME UP AND TO HAVE THE COURAGE TO SPEAK IN FRONT OF IT ALSO THANK YOU FOR DOING THAT -- I ALSO REPRESENT ALL HAMBRE AND SOME OTHER -- SURROUNDING AREAS AND DOWN I AM REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THE SURPLUS NON RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES BEING ABLE. TO YOU KNOW I HAVE A A BETTER USE AND AND GIVE YOU GUYS A PEACE OF MIND THAT YOU CAN PURCHASE SAID -- I DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THE STOPS BUT I ALREADY SPOKE WITH THE THE AUTHOR AND I KNOW WE'RE GONNA BE WORKING -- WITH CALTRANS TO TRY AND RESOLVE THAT AND SO WITH THAT. I WILL SUPPORT THE BILL -- ANY OTHER QUESTIONS NO OF SUPPORT TO MY UNDERSTANDING IS THE PREFERRED ALTERNATIVE AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT HAS BEEN DECIDED CORRECT AND AND MISTER CHAIRMAN YOU HAVE BEEN EXTREMELY -- YOUR APPROACH TO THIS ENTIRE ISSUE IS HAS BEEN TO LET THE I RB CERTIFIED. AND YOU KNOW WE MADE THAT COMMITMENT TO YEARS AGO TO YOU AND YOU KNOW WE'VE ALL. I THINK CALTRANS TRADITIONAL ADVERSARIES EVERYBODY HAS SORT OF ALLOW THE PROCESS TO PROCEED. AND I THINK YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THAT -- HAS IS TO BE COMMENDED. AND I JUST WANNA -- STATE THAT -- SINCE THE TRANSPORTATION -- DEMAND MANAGEMENT -- ALTERNATIVE IS NOW THE LOCALLY DECIDED UPON. AGREED UPON BY A BY THE ELECTED BODIES AND SO FORTH. ALTERNATIVE -- THIRD PLANNING TO USE SOME OF THE MEASURE ARE ANOTHER FUNDS AND WE'RE BECAUSE THIS IS A DIFFERENT AND HAVING -- PLAN AHEAD OF FREEWAY WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO WORK HARD NOT ONLY AT THE LA COUNTY LEVEL BUT THE STATE LEVEL. TO MAKE SURE THAT THE TIAS CM. TDM ALTERNATIVE IS SUCCESSFUL FOR ALL THE NEIGHBORHOODS IN THE AREA INCLUDING -- CIVIC CENTER RUBIO'S DISTRICT AS WELL. SO WE'RE WE'RE COMMITTED TO THAT HERE AND WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A A GOOD PLACE TO LIVE FOR THE YOUNG PEOPLE OF OF YOUR COMMUNITY AS WELL THANK YOU FOR COMING BY THE WAY. TO OUR COMMITTEE -- AND WE NOW HAVE A QUORUM SO TAKE A ROLL CALL PLEASE. THERE ABOUT YOUR BELL PRESENT BATES -- BATES PRESENT DODD. DODD PRESENT GALGIANI GALGIANI PRESENT MCGUIRE MORALE ROSS RUBIO. RUBIO PRESENT SKINNER STONE STONE PRESENT AMBERG FORECASTING CASSIE PRESENT. THE BILL. WE ARE MOTION FOR THE BILL --% AND WILL CALL THE ROLL. THANK CHAIRMAN MAY I SAY ONE MORE THING ROOF YES SIR SAME KEYWORD TâM. I'VE BEEN ASKED BY SEVERAL PEOPLE WHY I WAITED TO MY THIRTY YEAR TO INTRODUCE THIS BILL. AND WHILE THE FOR THE FACT. WHAT? IN THE SENATE YEAH. IN THE ASSEMBLY DIFFERENT STORY THAT WAS A DECADE AGO SO. THIS COAT THIS GO AROUND -- AND THE REASON WHY IS BECAUSE IS THE CHAIR AND I REFERENCED EARLIER. YOU KNOW. THE DEAL THAT WAS. DISCUSSED WAS TO ALLOW THE AYE ARE TO BE CERTIFIED. AND SO THAT GAVE THE IMPRIMATUR OF WHAT WE'RE DOING TODAY WITH THE SUPPORT OF THE LOCAL TRANSPORTATION AGENCY AND SORT OF THE TAKE THE CONTROVERSY OUT OF THE ISSUE. AND SO THAT WAS THE COMMITMENT I MADE BACK IN DECEMBER. TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN AND SO TODAY IS A FOLLOW AT FOLLOW UP ON THAT COMMITMENT AND YOU KNOW THE CHAIRS LEADERSHIP HAS BEEN PART OF IT AS WELL SO I RESPCTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. A THANK YOU -- CALL THE ROLL PLEASE. SENATE BILL SEVEN BY SENATOR PORTANTINO THE MOTION IS TO PASS AND REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS CENTER ABOUT BY WELL I BATES RIGHT BATES AYE DODD. DODD AYE GALGIANI GALGIANI AYE MCGUIRE MORALE ROSS RUBIO. RUBIO AYE SKINNER STONE STONE I AM BURKE WILL CASKEY BECAUSE HE AYE. SEVEN ZERO WILL LEAVE THE ROLL OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU THANK YOU EVERYBODY. OKAY -- MEMBERS -- WILL CAN WE MOVE TO THE CONSENT CALENDAR ON THE AGENDA TODAY. OF THE CONSENT CALENDAR -- IT CONSISTED OF ITEM -- THREE WITCHES SETTERS STERN'S BILL SB. ONE FORTY CENTER MINING'S BILL. SB. FIVE OH FOUR SIR COVER HEROES BILL SB -- SIX TWENTY EIGHT CENTER CHANG'S BILL -- SIX FORTY EIGHT ANSWER GALGIANI IS BILL. SIX EIGHTY FIVE THIRTY DISCUSSION ON A THOSE BILLS. OKAY BUT NOT ME WE HAVE A MOTION ON THE CONSENT CALENDAR. CAN YOU PLEASE CALL THE ROLL PLEASE AND THE CONSENT COUNCIL CALENDAR SENATOR ABOUT BY WELL I BATES HI BATES AYE DODD. DODD AYE GALGIANI. GALGIANI AYE MCGUIRE MORALE ROCKS. RUBIO. SKINNER STONE. STONE AYE AMBERG CASKEY WE GOT THE ICE. OKAY THANK YOU -- THAT POSSIBLY THE ROLE OF BROWN'S AND MEMBERS -- WILL NEXT -- MOVED TO CENTER ALLEN HIS TWO BILLS SB. FIFTY NINE AND SB FIVE TWENTY SIX CENTER. YOU HAVE THE FLOOR WHICH I KNOW YOU LIKE TO TAKE UP FIRST I LET'S DO FIFTY NINE TO SINCE THE OKAY WE ARE IN FILE ORDER -- THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS AND OBVIOUSLY I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR ITS WORK. ON THIS MEASURE AT THIS HAS TO DO WITH AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES. HI THE INTRODUCTION OF AUTONOMOUS PASSENGER VEHICLES ONTO OUR ROADS AND WITHIN OUR COMMUNITIES REALLY DOES HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO REVOLUTIONIZE. HOW WE GET AROUND AND RECEIVE OUR COMMUNITIES? NOW WE KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF TALK ABOUT HOW THE BY THE GREAT PROMISES THAT -- THE THAT THIS INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGY MAY BRING I MEAN ME DRASTICALLY REDUCE COLLISIONS. ENHANCE TRAFFIC FLOW THAT'S VERY PROMISING -- BUT IF NOT THOUGHTFULLY DESPITE DEPLOYED THIS NEW MOBILITY REVOLUTION COULD ALSO HAVE SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE IMPACTS INCLUDING EXACERBATING CALIFORNIA'S ALREADY. SEVERE CLIMATE AIR QUALITY PLANNING AND CONGESTION CHALLENGES SO IT'S REALLY GONNA COME DOWN TO HOW WE IMPLEMENT -- OVER HOW WE WITH THE SERVER THE THE THE THOUGHT THAT WE PUT INTO. THE INTRODUCTION OF THIS TECHNOLOGY ONTO OUR ROADS. I SEVERAL RECENT STUDIES HAVE FOUND THAT BECAUSE A VIS MAKE TRAVEL LESS ONEROUS. THEIR WIDESPREAD ADOPTION COULD ACTUALLY -- END UP INCREASING VEHICLE TRAVEL BY 15260%. IN AN EXPERIMENT CONDUCTED BY UC DAVIS UC BERKELEY AND GEORGIA TECH MIMICS LIFE WITH THE NAVY BY PROVIDING EACH PARTICIPATING HOUSEHOLD. WITH THE SHOW FOR AN EXPERIMENT SO I HOUSEHOLDS TRAVEL YOU 3% MORE MILES PER WEEK WITH MORE THAN A FIFTH OF THE VEHICLE TRIPS. SENATE CARRYING NO PASSENGERS AT ALL. BUT YOU JUST HAVE THE THE CARS CIRCULATING. SO THESE FINDINGS INDICATE THAT AV'S COULD ENCOURAGE CONSUMERS TO DRIVE MORE FREQUENTLY COMMUTE LONGER DISTANCES USE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION LAST. THUS INCREASING SPRAWL CONGESTION AND POLLUTION. INSTEAD THESE IMPACTS COULD BE AVOIDED IF THE STATE FINDS WAYS TO ENCOURAGE RIDE SHARING MINIMIZING ZERO OR PASSING A PASSENGER TRIPS. AND QUICKLY MOVE FORWARD TOWARD ELECTRIFYING THE FLEET. SO THESE ARE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT ARE FLOATING OUT THERE IN THIS CONVERSATION I I WE REALLY DON'T HAVE A GOOD WAY OF KNOWING HOW IT IS THAT. THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY MAY IMPACT I PRESENT IT'S KIND OF A WORST CASE SCENARIO BUT I THINK IT'S WORTH. OUR OUR SPENDING SOME TIME CONTEMPLATING THAT AND AND AND UNDERSTAND HOW IMPORTANT IT IS FOR US TO REALLY STUDY AND GET TO THE BOTTOM OF OF THIS. POTENTIALLY REVOLUTIONARY CHANGE TO THE WAY THAT WE GET AROUND A PLANNED INCREASE OUR CITY SAID THIS BILL SB FIFTY NINE CREATES. AN INTERAGENCY WORKING GROUP. TO DELIBERATELY PLANNED FOR A THOMAS VEHICLES IN A WAY THAT SUPPORTS THE STATE'S PLANNING CLIMATE AND SUSTAINABILITY GOALS WITH THE MIND TOWARD AVOIDING. POTENTIAL A NEGATIVE IMPACTS VERTICALLY THE TRANSPORTATION SPACE. WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH MANY STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING INDUSTRY GROUPS AUTOMAKERS ENVIRONMENTALISTS TO REFINE THE MEASURE TO INSURE THAT WE DELIVER REALLY PLAN WILL NOT SIGN ME -- THIS THIS INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGY AND SO I'M VERY COMMITTED TO WORKING CLOSELY WITH -- STAKEHOLDER GROUPS AS THE BILL PROCEEDS. I KNOW THAT WE SAW SOME MORE WORK TO DRESS CONCERNS AT THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED A CONVERSATIONS OF AN VERY PRODUCTIVE. AND I HAVE WITH ME JASON FROM THE UNION OF CONCERNED SCIENTISTS ALSO RIGHT. TO CHARGE FROM CAL START -- THEY'RE GONNA BOTH SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. IN FAVOR PLEASE SHOW THE FLOOR. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS CHASIN BARB US WITH THE UNION OF CONCERNED SCIENTISTS AND JUST BRIEFLY YOU BUILD ON THAT PRESENTATION CENTER ALLEN JUST MADE. ABOUT HOW THE ADVENT OF SELF DRIVING CARS COULD POSE EITHER BENEFITS OR RISKS TO OUR CLIMATE. AND WHY THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD ACT SAID TO STEER THE TECHNOLOGY IN A CLIMATE SMART DIRECTION. MANY RESEARCHERS ARE ARE ANALYZING THIS ISSUE AND AND HOW SELF DRIVING CARS COULD IMPACT TRAVEL AND CONGESTION. AND ACCESSIBILITY I AM POLLUTION AND IT'S PROVIDING IMPORT INSIGHTS INTO HOW -- THE ABOUT THE POTENTIAL FOR BUILDING A MODERN TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM BUT ALSO THE SIGNIFICANT RISKS OF INACTION. AND SO YOU KNOW THE POSITIVE VISION THAT WE ASPIRE TO FOR SUSTAINABILITY IS ONE IN WHICH A VIS -- ARE PAIRED WITH ELECTRIC VEHICLES WHICH HAVE LOWER CARBON EMISSIONS WHILE ALSO USHERING IN A NEW WAVE OF TRANSPORTATION SERVICES THINK. UBER AND LIFT TWO POINT NO WHERE SHARED RIDER MORE CONVENIENT AN INDIVIDUAL COULD VEHICLE OWNERSHIP IN OUR COST COMPETITIVE. AND WHEN WHEN COMBINED WITH INCREASED ACCESS TO MOBILITY OPTIONS LIKE SHARED BIKES AND SHARE SCOOTERS AND EFFICIENT MASS TRANSIT AS WELL AS SAFER STREETS. INDIVIDUALS COULD CHOOSE FROM A WIDER VARIETY OF OPTIONS FOR EACH TRIP RATHER THAN ALWAYS DEFAULTING TO THE CAR FORMALLY PARKED IN THEIR DRIVEWAY. SO THAT'S THAT'S A POSITIVE VISION THAT WE'RE SHOOTING FOR AND THAT WOULD BE LOWERING EMISSIONS LOWERING VEHICLE TRAVEL -- BUT THERE'S MUCH TO BE CONCERNED IN TERMS OF THIS WEATHER THIS OUTCOME WILL RESULT WITHOUT PUBLIC POLICY TO TO STEER. ANSWER JUST BRIEFLY A COUPLE OF THE RISKS OF THAT -- RESEARCH HAS HAS UNCOVERED ONE IS THAT EIGHTIES COULD DRAMATICALLY INCREASE DRIVING. SO IF EIGHTIES PRIMARILY ENABLE INCREASE SINGLE OCCUPANCY VEHICLE TRIPS WE ARE CERTAINLY IN TROUBLE BECAUSE WE ARE ONE OF THE THE WIDELY CITED STUDIES FROM RESEARCHERS FROM A NUMBER OF THE PARTNERSHIP FROM THREE DIFFERENT UNIVERSITIES. FOUND -- THEY LOOKED AT THE THE IMPACT ON TRAVEL BEHAVIOR IN CARBON EMISSIONS A WHOLE NUMBER OF DIFFERENT FACTORS THAT WOULD COME FROM FROM THE ADVENT OF THE TIME IS VEHICLES IN THE SINGLE LARGEST. INCREASE IN EMISSIONS AND ENERGY USE. CAME FROM BEHAVIORAL RESPONSE SO CENTER ALLEN TO REFER TO THIS ALREADY BUT YOU KNOW DRIVING CAN NOW BE A PRODUCTIVE TIME. BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT BEHIND THE WHEEL COMMANDING THE VEHICLE THEN LONGER COMMUTES FOR EGGS FOR INSTANCE -- MAY NOT BE THE BURDEN THAT THEY ONCE WERE -- IN THIS STUDY FOUND A VIS COULD INCREASE VEHICLE TRAVEL -- BY HOPEFULLY NOT LIKE THE GUY THAT FELL ASLEEP IN. YEAH I AREAS THAT WAS ON HIGHWAY ONE I WANT TO SLEEP IN HONEST AS LOW AS IT WAS GOING. SIXTY FIVE MILES AN HOUR. THAT WAS NOT. TO I WAS I DON'T NEED THAT. ONE OF THAT ONE OF THE SECOND RISKS IS THAT PEOPLE WILL NOT END UP SHARING RIDES IN SELF DRIVING VEHICLES IN THAT MORE ALL OVER THEY PULL PEOPLE FROM TRANSIT. WHICH AFTER ALL IS THE ORIGINAL POOL DRIED. AND AND SO -- IS SIMILARLY RESEARCH THERE AS ALSO LOOK AT HOW EVEN IF WE HAVE. SELF DRIVING CARS AND THEIR ELECTRIC CARS IF WE ARE PULLING RIDES ARE STILL GONNA NOT BE REACHING OUR OUR CLIMATE GOALS. AND A FINAL RISK THAT I'LL I'LL MENTION IS IS AV'S COULD EXACERBATE A PERPETUATE INEQUITIES IN OUR COUNTRY EXPECTATIONS SYSTEM SO. YOU KNOW OUR OUR CURRENT CAR OWNERSHIP BASED TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM DOES NOT SERVE ALL COMMUNITIES IN AN EQUITABLE WAY. AN EIGHTIES COULD IMPROVE MOBILITY FOR COMMUNITIES HISTORICALLY UNDERSERVED BY CURRENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM. FOR THE CURRENT INEQUITIES COULD BE EXACERBATED IN FOR EXAMPLE MY ORGANIZATION. RECENTLY MODEL SEVERAL SCENARIOS OF THE EFFECTS OF SELF DRIVING CARS IN THE WASHINGTON DC METROPOLITAN AREA. AND FOUND THE PEOPLE LIVING IN LOW INCOME NEIGHBORHOODS AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. EXPERIENCED FORTY SEVEN TIMES AS MUCH CONGESTED DRIVING IS THE REGIONAL AVERAGE I IN THAT ANALYSIS. SO JUST TO SUMMARIZE I THINK THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL -- IN ONE SENSE OF DATES THAT EIGHTIES MAY BE ABLE TO DRIVE THEMSELVES. BUT IT'S UP TO THE STATE GOVERNMENT TO STEER THEM IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND SB FIFTY NINE TAKES IMPORTANT STEP IN STRANGE TECHNOLOGY AS A SAMPLING. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- NEXT BIGGER PLEASE. GOOD AFTERNOON A RARE AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS I'M RANGE YOU ARE POLICY DIRECTOR FOR CAL START WERE A TECHNOLOGY CONSORTIUM THIS BEEN WORKING FOR THE LAST TWENTY FIVE YEARS TO ACCELERATE THE GROWTH OF CLEAN TRANSPORTATION INDUSTRY JOBS INVESTMENT. AS YOU'VE HEARD WHETHER CALIFORNIA'S READY OR NOT AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES ARE A THESE ARE HERE AND THEY'RE POISED TO TRANSFORM THE STATE'S ENTIRE TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM AND THE WAY THEY CALIFORNIANS USE IT. AND WE'RE ENCOURAGED BY A VIS. THE TECHNOLOGY COULD SPEED THE GROWTH ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES THE COULD ENCOURAGE CARPOOLING GIVE NEW TOOLS TO TRANSIT AGENCIES -- AND REDUCE ACCIDENTS THERE MOSTLY CAUSED BY DRIVER ERROR. BUT AS YOU HAVE ALSO HEARD SINCE IT IS A NEW TECHNOLOGY WE'RE JUST GUESSING AT THE FUTURE AND WE DON'T KNOW WHAT EXACTLY IS COMING. OTHER THAN THAT THE EFFECTS OF A DRIVERLESS FUTURE WILL BE PROFOUND AND WILL BE COMPLEX. ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS INDUSTRY EXPERTS AND PUBLIC OFFICIALS ARE ALL TRYING TO COME TO GRIPS WITH THIS AND DEVELOP A CLEAR VIEW ABOUT THE FUTURE OF AV'S. ON BOTH THE BENEFITS AND THE CONCERNS MUCH LIKE THIS COMMITTED WITH THE HEARING ON THE SUBJECT LAST YEAR. SO THERE ARE STILL SOME MORE QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS HOW HOW LADIES -- EFFECTIVE VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED IN LAND USE HELLO LADIES AFFECT INDIVIDUALS USE OF ALTERNATIVE MODES PARTICULAR PUBLIC TRANSIT BICYCLING AND OTHER ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION -- HOW CAN WE PROMOTE SHARED PASSENGER MOBILITY AND ON BALANCE WILL A THESE HELP OR HINDER CALIFORNIAN ACHIEVING ITS CLIMATE GOALS? WE WANT TO GIVE AB TECHNOLOGY THE BEST CHANCE IT HAS TO CREATE THE MOST BENEFITS FOR CALIFORNIANS AND SUCCEED IN THE LONG RUN. SB FIFTY NINE WILL HELP CREATE A CONSENSUS VIEW ACROSS AGENCIES IN THE LEGISLATURE ABOUT WHAT THE KEY ISSUES AND GOALS ARE FOR THIS DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGY AND WHAT THEY NEED TO BE. FOR THESE REASONS WE BELIEVE IN THAT AUTONOMOUS VEHICLE TASK FORCE IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY -- TO CREATE SUCH AN IMPORTANT QUESTION WE RESPECTFULLY URGE AYE VOTE. THANK YOU -- SPEAKERS IN FAVOR PLEASE COME FORWARD. AT THANK YOU SENATORS JOSH WAS STARK ON BEHALF OF TRANSFORM IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. WILL BE AIRED AMERICAN LUNG ASSOCIATION ALSO IN SUPPORT. CATHERINE GARCIA WITH SIERRA CLUB CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON MEDI BAKER PLANNING CONSERVATION LEAGUE WE HAVEN'T TAKEN A FORMAL POSITION ON THIS BILL BUT WE SUPPORT THE PROPOSAL ON CONTENT. THE NET MANTEGNA'S NGUYEN BERMAN CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT OF BILL FIFTY NINE THANK YOU OKAY ARM. TO HAVE SPEAKERS OPPOSING THE BILL PLEASE COME. FOR OF ONE CHIU LETTER C. GO AHEAD. MR TURN MEMBERS COURTNEY JENSEN ON BEHALF OF TECH THAT -- WE ARE IN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION I FIRST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO THE AUTHOR AND THE STAFF FOR THEIR GREAT WORK ON THE BILL SO FAR WITH THE AMENDMENTS ON THAT WENT INTO THE BILL OF REFLECT A LOT OF OUR CONCERNS -- BUT WE DO HAVE SOME MOVING FORWARD AND SO WE REMAIN OPPOSED UNLESS AMENDED POSITION TO CONTINUE OUR WORK WITH THE AUTHOR AND THE AUTHORS OFFICE IN THE SPONSORS OF THE BILL. I'M GENERALLY TECH THAT'S APPROACH SHOULD -- THOMAS VEHICLE LEGISLATION IS MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE SUPPORTING THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS TECHNOLOGY THIS TECHNOLOGY IS STILL DEVELOPING WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT STIFLING. THIS INNOVATION -- AND THAT THE BENEFITS AND POTENTIAL CONSEQUENCES OF THIS TECHNOLOGY COMES WHEN THERE'S WIDESPREAD DEPLOYMENT OF THIS TECHNOLOGY WE'RE NOT THERE YET AS MUCH AS I WOULDLIKE TO NOT DRIVE A CAR TOMORROW. WE'VE GOT AWHILE TO GO BEFORE WE GET THERE -- SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT ADDS CALIFORNIA LOOKS DOWN THE LINE FOR THIS TECHNOLOGY IN THE WIDESPREAD DEPLOYMENT OF THIS TECHNOLOGY THERE WERE AVOIDING POLICY IS -- THAT COULD STIFLE THE INNOVATION OF THIS TYPE OF THIS TECHNOLOGY THAT WOULD MAKE IT SAFER THEY WOULD MEET YOU KNOW GET CLOSER TO CALIFORNIA'S -- GREENHOUSE SCHOOL GAS EMISSIONS GOALS AND ALL THOSE KIND OF THINGS WE DON'T WANT TO WE DON'T WANT TO STIFLE THIS TECHNOLOGY -- BUT WE WANT TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH DOLLARS OFFICE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THIS WORKING GROUP AND PROVIDE THEM SOME GUIDING PRINCIPLES THAT ARE APPROPRIATE FOR WHERE THE TECHNOLOGY IS AT TODAY AND WHERE WE WANTED TO BE IN THE FUTURE. SO WE APPRECIATE THAT. OF OTHERS SPEAKERS OPPOSING -- DISCUSSION -- COMMITTEE. I A I A I A I HAD A QUESTION ON THIS -- I NOTICED THAT THE MULTI MODAL -- ASPECT IS GOING TO BE LOOKED INTO BY THE TASK FORCE -- I THINK THE AREA THAT I'M SPECIFICALLY INTERESTED IN IS. HOW THE AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES? COULD AID AND OR HOW THEY WOULD AFFECT PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS. OF THE BUS SYSTEM WILL IT REPLACE THE BUSES. ON CERTAIN ROUTES. A IS THERE A POTENTIAL FOR THAT OR WILL IT ENHANCE -- OTHER -- TRANSIT -- TRANSIT SYSTEMS LIKE A HEAVY RAIL OR OTHER KINDS OF TRANSIT -- SO WILL REPLACE IN OFFER REPLACES. BUSES -- ON CERTAIN ROUTES OR IN CERTAIN AREAS. OF HOW IT WAS IMPLICATIONS OF THAT IN TERMS OF LAND USE PLANNING FOR EXAMPLE I MEAN THE SIR ALLAN JOB I KNOW YOU PUT IT IS ONE OF THE GOALS. BUT I WANTED. TO ASK YOU ABOUT -- DATA MISTER CHAIR THAT I MEAN THAT THAT'S A THAT'S A PERFECT. EXAMPLE OF THE KIND OF OF REALLY IMPORTANT QUESTION. THAT WE NEED TO BE SPENDING TIME LOOKING AT AND THAT'S WHAT. WE'RE LOOKING TO TO EXAMINE HI THERE JUST SO MANY UNCERTAINTIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE ROLL OUT. OF THIS TECHNOLOGY WHICH COULD BE INCREDIBLY PROMISING I MEAN I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE ALL WE WERE I GUESS THE POINT HERE IS WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT. IT REALLY DOES SERVE -- THE NEEDS OF OUR SOCIETY AND AND AND AND BECOME SOMETHING IT BECOMES IMMENSELY POPULAR AND SUCCESSFUL AND SAFE AND ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY AND AND ALL OF THE THINGS THAT IT PROMISES TO DO -- AND AND NOT SEE THAT THAT QUESTION OF MULTI MODAL AND WOULD WOULD BE ACTUALLY ONE OF THE ONE OF THE CENTRAL QUESTIONS BEING ASKED BY -- BY THE BY THE OFFICE -- SO. TO THE EXPERTS HAVE ANY OPINION ABOUT THE DO YOU THINK IT WILL HAVE AN IMPACT ON BUS ROUND SERVER -- TRANSIT IN SOME WAY HOW WOULD IT AFFECT TRANSIT. SYSTEMS DAVIS WELL IT YOU KNOW-IT'S NOT CONCLUSIVE AT THIS POINT BUT I THINK THE YOU KNOW THE RESEARCH IS OUT THERE -- RAISES THE EXACT SAME CONCERNS THAT YOU HAVE AND THEN THERE'S REASON TO BELIEVE THAT A THAT EITHER OUTCOME -- IS POSSIBLE AND AND PROBABLY WILL TAKE IT'LL TAKE MORE CONSIDERATION OF WHAT WOULD BE THE POLICY LEVERS AND TOOLS THAT STATE AND REGIONAL GOVERNMENTS MIGHT HAVE. TO ENSURE THE BEST OUTCOME THERE WILL WE HAVE HEALTHY TRANSIT -- THAT'S COMPLIMENTING THE USE OF OF SELF DRIVING CARS -- YOU KNOW PART OF THE ESPY ONE WAS TO DO -- CERRONE WAS TO DO -- RESEARCH WE pYEAR AND SB ONE FOR RESEARCH. IF WE ASK THE UNIVERSITY -- RESEARCH ORGANIZATIONS TO CENSOR TASK FORCE WOULD THAT BE IMMENSELY HELPFUL AND I AND I LOVE ACTUALLY YOU KNOW THE UC DAVIS INSTITUTE OF TRANSPORTATION STUDIES. WORKS ON THIS YET EVEN LOOKING THEIR VERY INTO THIS BILL AND ARE REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THE PROMISE THAT COULD BRING BUT THAT WOULD BE A GREAT QUESTION AND WE WILL BRING THE PROFESSORS FROM THERE YOU KNOW. DEAR AND HAVE YOU HAVE A SOUL DIALOGUE WITH THEM IN. OKAY THANK YOU ALL OF ALL SEE IF I CAN INCLUDE AND ARE REQUESTED RESEARCH THERE'S A WORK WITH YOUR OFFICE ON ON THE BACK OF WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- THIS ARE THE QUESTIONS FROM. MEMBERS SENATORS SKINNER. CENTER BATES YOU WANT ME TO MOTIONS -- SKINNER. THANK YOU SENATOR -- I AM WILLING TO MOVE THE BILL. OKAY AND A I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD I HAD A BILL THAT WAS SOMEWHAT SIMILAR [inaudible] THE MY FIRST YEAR IN THE SENATE -- THAT WAS RECOGNIZING THE FACT THAT -- MANY INDUSTRIES NOT TO SEND ST SPORTS NOT MANY AUTOMAKERS AND OTHER ENTITIES ARE LOOKING VERY STRONGLY AT MOVING. TOWARDS AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES AS A DOMINANT OF OF VEHICLE ON OUR ROADS AND WE WANT TO BE I THINK THE STATE WANTS TO BE PREPARED RATHER THAN GETTING A SITUATION LIKE WE HAVE SO MANY TIMES WHERE. EITHER A NEW TECHNOLOGY OR NEW PRACTICE IS ALREADY FLOODED US AND THEN WE'RE TRYING TO REGULATE. THAT WE THINK IN ADVANCE WHAT ARE SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WE MIGHT BE ANTICIPATED BESIDES SAFETY. THAT WE SHOULD BE ADDRESSING AS THESE AT ARMS VEHICLES ROLL OUT AND I THINK SUCH TASK FORCE SO SO THANK YOU. OUR CENTER BATES. THANK YOU ARE. SENATOR BAIL QUESTION FOR YOU SENATOR ALLEN I'M JUST LOOKING OUT WHO WOULD SERVE ON THE ON THE TASK FORCE OF THE STUDY GROUP THING YOU DON'T SHOW THAT WE HAVE ANY FOR ANYONE FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND I THINK SAFETY -- IS THERE IS A HUGE ISSUE WITH REGARDS TO THE AUTOMATION. SO I WOULD HOPE YOU'D CONSIDER -- SOMEONE FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT IN PARTICULAR THE HIGHWAY PATROL IT WAS MENTIONED IN OUR ANALYSIS AS A THIS WOULD BE A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. YEAH I I THINK YOU'RE -- I THINK JUST IT THAT'S NOT A BAD IDEA AND ANY AYE AND I'M ABSOLUTELY HAPPY -- TO CONSIDER I DON'T JUST MEAN THAT IN THE WAY THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY THAT AND THEN THEY DON'T MEAN IT. REALLY CONSIDERI I ACTUALLY THINK IT'S I JUST WROTE DOWN HE REALLY MEANS IT I I I I I I THINK. I THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA THE THE REASON WHY IT WASN'T IN ORIGINALLY IS THAT THIS IS. NOT -- DID DID THERE THE THE WE WERE TRYING TO FILL THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF WORK ON THE SAFETY SIDE. HI AND AND WE'RE TRYING TO FILL A GAP. BASICALLY EVERYTHING ELSE INVOLVING A VISA IS NOT REALLY BEEN OUT OF A LOOK AT AND I'LL BE SAD. IF THE THE INCLUDING LOT FORCE IS NOT JUST A FIFTIES RIGHT ALSO ABOUT TRAFFIC FLOW IT'S ABOUT. CULPABILITY LIABILITY -- TICKETS YOU KNOW I MEAN ALL THAT SO I I AM TALKING MYSELF INTO I THINK THAT'S A GREAT IDEA. AND WE HAVE A YOU HAVE A A SLOT ON YOUR COMMITTEE FOR THE TRANSPORTATION AGENCY WE DO WHICH INCLUDES THE CH WE DO SO THE LEADER OF THAT ARE THAT MIGHT BE THE PLACE TO DO IT. BUT I I I THINK WE WOULD BE I THINK WILL BE A GOOD IDEA TO HAVE SINCE I I'D SAY THAT BECAUSE SERVING AT LOCAL GOVERNMENT THE VEHICLE CODE IS HUGE IN TERMS OF HOW YOU SET SPEED LIMITS SOBS. WHERE ALL OF THAT AND IT'S AGO IF THIS COMES TO PASS YOU HAVE A VEHICLE CODE THAT IS GOING TO BE TOTALLY [inaudible] YOU KNOW. THE ANGER MOOT NO I'VE STALINIST ART.

THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT IT FILLS THE THE PROMISE OF SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL FRIENDLINESS AND AND AND AND GOOD PLANNING AND AND CONGESTION RELIEF AND AND CREATING AT THE CITIES THAT WILL ACTUALLY FUNCTION BETTER. SO WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE I THINK THIS WILL HELP TO MOVE US IN THAT DIRECTION.

IT WAS ONLY CRAP BECAUSE THERE WERE SO MANY PEOPLE IN THE ROOM -- BUT I I THINK IS A VERY FRUITFUL DISCUSSION AND APPRECIATE YOUR WORK LOOK I WAS IN THERE YEAH IT WAS. ALL RIGHT SO. SO -- WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL THAT WE FIND A WAY TO EFFECTIVELY REDUCE -- THE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND POLLUTION ASSOCIATED WITH LAND USE AND TRANSPORTATION SECTOR -- BUT YOU KNOW THERE REALLY HAS BEEN A TOUGH NUT TO CRACK IN A I DO APPRECIATE THIS COMMITTEES ENGAGEMENT MISS. IN THIS AREA SO -- HI BUT WE ARE WE ARE PREPARED TO ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS -- THAT ARE OFFERED BY THE COMMITTEE AND YOU KNOW I UNDERSTAND THE SENSITIVITY THE COMMITTEE IS BROUGHT TO THE ISSUE OF OF OF SHIP FUNDING AND AND YEAH I I JUST ASK THE CHAIR THE CHAIR AND I SPOKE A LITTLE BEFORE THAT. THIS MEETING BUT I I REALLY DO ASK THE CHAIR. TO ASSIST US IN AND HELPING TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS -- THIS BILL DOES REALLY IS REALLY MEANINGFUL I'M IF WE'RE NOT GONNA DO IT THROUGH -- THE SHIP FUNDING ISSUE AND LET LET'S FIGURE OUT ANOTHER WAY TO TO TO MAKE IT MEANINGFUL STEPS DEFINING WHEN I TOOK A STEP FUNDING -- SO. I IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT AS AS FOLKS KNOW THE LEGISLATURE PASSED SB THREE SEVENTY FIVE THIS WAS PRO TEM STEINBERG. BILL WHICH WAS ABOUT SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES IT WAS ALL ABOUT TRYING TO LINK TRANSPORTATION LAND USE AND HOUSING EFFORTS WITH OUR CLIMATE GOALS NUMBER THE THE LAW REQUIRES THE AIR BOARD TO SET GROUP REGIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS. REDUCTION TARGETS FOR THE STATE'S EIGHTEEN METROPOLITAN PLANNING ORGANIZATIONS. AND THEN THE NPOS -- CRITICIZE THE ANIMAL COMMUNITY STRATEGY. AS PART OF THEIR REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION PLAN WHICH IS DESIGNED TO HELP THEM MEET THEIR REDUCTION TARGETS. WE THEN IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN JUST A COUPLE YEARS AGO PASSED SB ONE FIFTY WHICH ASK HARD TO ASSESS THE PROGRESS WE'VE MADE TOWARD MEETING THE REDUCTION TARGETS AND THE SAD TRUTH IS THAT WE'VE NOW HEARD BACK FROM CARBON THEY SAID UNEQUIVOCALLY. THAT CALIFORNIA IS NOT ON TRACK -- A TO MEET ITS GREEN I GET GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTIONS EXPECTED UNDER SB THREE SEVENTY FIVE AND A NOTED CONCERNS OVER QUOTE THE CONTINUE PERVASIVE IN LONG STANDING DISCONNECT. BETWEEN THE FACTORS THAT SHAPE REGIONAL GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT CALIFORNIA SUCH TRANSPORTATION INVESTMENT. REGULATORY AND HOUSING MARKET CONDITIONS OF THE LOCAL REGIONAL STATE LEVELS AND THE STATE'S ENVIRONMENTAL EQUITY CLIMATE HEALTH ECONOMIC AND HOUSING GOALS. THIS REPORT. F.. SB FIVE TWENTY SIX ESTABLISHES THE MOBILITY ACTION PLAN FOR HEALTHY COMMUNITIES AND THIS WOULD BE A TASK FORCE CHARGED WITH IDENTIFYING STRATEGIES TO GET THE STATE ON TRACK TO MEETING OUR CLIMATE GOALS. FROM THE TRANSPORTATION LAND USE SECTORS. AN INCREASE THE PROCESS TO CLEVERNESS SORRY DATA TO EVALUATE THE PROGRESS THAT REGION'S ARE MAKING THE BILL ALSO CALLS ON OUR END PO'S. TO INCLUDE AN ACTION PLAN WITHIN THEIR REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION PLAN. THAT SPELLS OUT HOW THEIR SUSTAINABLE COMMITTEE STRATEGY. I WILL BE IMPLEMENTED. AND IT'S OUR HOPE THAT THIS WILL INCREASE ACCOUNTABILITY WILL GIVE ALL LEVELS OF DECISION MAKERS STATE REGIONAL LOCAL A SENSE FOR WHAT IS NEEDED. TO MEET OUR TARGETS -- NOW THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS MAKES SEVERAL SUGGESTIONS THAT I WANT TO DRESS FIRST COMMON NUMBER THREE QUESTIONS THE TIMING OF THE BILL -- I I YOU RESPECTFULLY DON'T AGREE THAT THIS. MEASURES PREMATURE WE WE ASK THE AIRPORT TO LOOK AT WHETHER OR NOT WE'RE MEETING THE GOALS OF SB THREE SEVENTY FIVE WHICH COURSES PAST. TEN YEARS AGO. ARE WE HAVE THE REPORT BACK AT THE BOOKS YOU KNOW THE THE THE THE THE BILLS ON THE BOOKS FOR TEN YEARS IN THE LAND USE DECISIONS THAT WE MAKE NOW HAVE LONG TERM IMPLICATIONS AND IT REALLY IS TIME FOR US TO FIGURE OUT. HOW TO RIGHT THE SHIP IN MEET THE TRUE PROMISE OF SB? THREE SEVENTY FIVE NO COMING OVER FOR THE HOUSE IS STRONGLY -- THE THE THE ALSO SUGGEST STRIKING THE SECTION THE BILL RELATED -- TO TO TO STEP FUNDING. I AND YOU KNOW I REALLY DO BELIEVE THAT THE STATE NEEDS TO PUT ITS MONEY WHERE ITS PRIORITIES ARE AND IF REGION'S AREN'T MEETING THEIR TARGETS SHOULD. SEE FUNDING BE USED TO DIG A DEEPER HOLE. THAT BEING SAID AS I MENTIONED I TALKED -- TO THE CHAIR I UNDERSTAND WHERE HE'S COMING FROM HIM I'M CERTAINLY WILLING TO TAKE THIS AMENDMENT NOW WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT STAKEHOLDERS. AND THE COMMITTEE AND THE CHAIR WILL WILL CONTINUE TO WORK TOGETHER TO FIND A WAY TO ADDRESS THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE AND MAKE SURE THERE'S REAL MEANING. IN THIS BILL -- WE CERTAINLY ARE CONTINUED YOU COMMITTED TO CONTINUING DISCUSSIONS WITH STAKEHOLDERS HAVE BEEN VERY PRODUCTIVE SO FAR WE WANT TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO IDENTIFY HOW TO BEST A LINE. ALL OF OUR STATE GOALS IN OUR FUNDING. AND YOU KNOW WE WE WE WE KNOW THAT THE GOALS THAT ARE LAID OUT THREE THIRTY FIVE IMPORTANT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GET A REAL MEANING AND AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE THIS BILL TODAY SO. WITH WITH THAT UNDERSTANDING I WE'RE WE'RE WILLING TO ACCEPT -- THOSE THOSE CRITICAL MOMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE BUT BUT REALLY DO HAVE TO FIGURE OUT A WAY MOVING FORWARD TO MAKE SURE THIS BLL REMAINS STRONG. I HAVE WITH ME CARTER RUBIN FROM AN RTC JOSH START FROM TRANSFORMERS CARMINA UNIT YOU'RE NOT CATERING. OKAY ALL RIGHT WELL YEAH WILL BEAR IT YOU'RE NOT WILL BURY OKAY YOU WILL VERY RIGHT OKAY. SO AND JOSH STARK IS BACK THERE SOMEWHERE YEAH OKAY. WE HAVE SOME GOOD FOLKS HERE TO TALK ABOUT THE BILL AND VICTORIA ROME FROM AN RTC. YES ALL SORTS OF FOLKS. YOU KNOW YEAH THE FLOOD TO PEOPLE IN RADIO. THANK YOU SENATOR ALLEN THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I' VICTORIA ROME WITH THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL HERE IN SUPPORT OF SB FIVE TWENTY SIX AND I JUST WANNA KNOW QUICKLY. THAT WE HAVE A GROUP OF OUR VOLUNTEERS AND MEMBERS HERE TODAY FROM SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA THERE IN THE FIRST COUPLE ROWS THERE AND THEY'RE HERE IN SUPPORT. AS WELL AS SPEAKING TO MEMBERS BOUT SOME OTHER IMPORTANT ENVIRONMENTAL BILLS TODAY. SO -- AS YOU HEARD SB FIVE TWENTY SIX IS DESIGNED TO ENSURE THAT CALIFORNIA'S EFFORT TO HALT CLIMATE CHANGE. EXTENDS TO OUR LARGEST SOURCE OF GREENHOUSE GASES THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR. AS YOU WELL KNOW CALIFORNIANS ARE ALREADY SUFFERING FROM THE DEVASTATED IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE WITH POOR AIR QUALITY. DESPITE INCREASINGLY FREQUENT AN UNPRECEDENTED DISASTERS WE CONTINUE TO INVEST IN INFRASTRUCTURE THAT ONLY ADDS TO OUR EMISSIONS. OUR OWN STATE AGENCIES HAVE RAISE THE ALARM THAT OUR CURRENT TRANSPORTATION POLICIES ARE PUSHING MORE ROADS AND WIDER ROADS. EXPERTS AND OUR OWN EXPERIENCES TELL US THIS JUST ENCOURAGES MORE AND MORE DRIVING. SB FIVE TWENTY SIX BUILT ON THE FOUNDATIONAL WORK OF SB THREE SEVENTY FIVE FROM TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT SB ONE FIFTY FROM. TWENTY SEVENTEEN TO RECOGNIZE THAT FIGHTING CLIMATE CHANGE MEANS GIVING CALIFORNIANS SOMETHING THEY CONSISTENTLY ASKED FOR THE ABILITY TO GET AROUND TO WITHOUT GETTING IN THEIR CAR. THANKS TO SB ONE FIFTY THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD PRODUCE THE FIRST COMPREHENSIVE LOOK AT THE SIGNIFICANT MISALIGNMENT BETWEEN OUR TRANSPORTATION INVESTMENTS AND OUR CLIMATE GOALS. AND THEY FOUND THAT CALIFORNIA IS NOT ON TRACK TO MEET GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION REDUCTIONS EXPECTED UNDER SB. THREE SEVENTY FIVE REDUCING VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED AS NECESSARY TO MEET OUR CLIMATE GOALS EVEN THESE ARE WONDERFUL BUT THEY ALONE WON'T GET US THERE. THE PORTION OF COMMUTERS DRIVING ALONE TO WORK IS RISING AND ALMOST EVERY REGION. CALIFORNIA STANDS TO SPEND ONE POINT ONE TRILLION DOLLARS OVER THE LIFE OF CURRENT TRANSPORTATION PLANS BUT THESE PROJECTS ARE NOT ALIGNED WITH CLIMATE GOALS OR STRAIGHT PRIORITIES ON EQUITABLE GROWTH AN OPEN SPACE CONSERVATION. TO SECURE THE PUBLIC HEALTH EQUITY AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND TRANSPORTATION AND MOBILITY CHOICES ENVISIONED BY SB. THREE SEVENTY FIVE AND TO ENSURE WE REMAIN ON TRACK TO REDUCING HARMFUL POLLUTION. AND ATTAINING HEALTH PROTECTIVE CLIMATE STANDARDS REAL CHANGES MUST BE MADE TAA TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM AND INVESTMENTS. WE THANK SENATOR ALLEN FOR HIS LEADERSHIP ON ON THIS ISSUE AND ON SB FIVE TWENTY SIX PACIFIC LEE AND RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU -- NEXT WEEK -- PLEASE. GOOD AFTERNOON I'M WILL BEAR IT WITH THE AMERICAN LUNG ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA THE AMERICAN LUNG ASSOCIATION IS CO SPONSORING SB FIVE TWENTY SIX TO HELP ADDRESS THE CRITICAL. NEED TO REDUCE HARMFUL TRANSPORTATION EMISSIONS AND CREATE HEALTHIER COMMUNITIES FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. IN SHORT LAND USE AND TRANSPORTATION DECISIONS AND TRANSPORTATION INVESTMENTS MUST BE VIEWED AS PUBLIC HEALTH DECISIONS. CALIFORNIA PUBLIC HEALTH ORGANIZATIONS HAVE LONG SUPPORTED THE IMPLEMENTATION OF SB THREE SEVENTY FIVE AND WE'RE DEEPLY CONCERNED WITH THE FINDINGS OF THE SB ONE FIFTY REPORT. BLUNTLY WE AREN'T ON TRACK. THE PROMISE OF HEALTH YOUR COMMUNITIES ENVISIONED IN OUR NPOS -- SCS PLANS IS NOT BEING REALIZED DUE TO A VARIETY OF FACTORS OUTLINED IN THE REPORT. INCLUDING ROADWAY EXPANSION PROJECTS -- CHALLENGES WITH HOUSING PRODUCTION. IN OTHER OUTSIDE FACTORS. I SENATOR ALLEN NOTED THE DISCONNECT BETWEEN LOCAL ACTIONS AND STATE GOALS IS HIGHLY PROBLEMATIC. THROUGH THE SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF SB THREE SEVENTY FIVE WE CAN ACHIEVE A WIDE RANGE OF PUBLIC HEALTH BENEFITS RELATED TO CHRONIC ILLNESSES IN CANCERS RESPIRATORY AND CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE. OBESITY RELATED DISEASES AND DIABETES IMPROVEMENTS IN SAFETY FOR ALL PASSENGERS AND ALL TRAVELERS ON OUR ROADS AND STREETS. MENTAL HEALTH IMPROVEMENTS AND SENIOR AND YOUTH INDEPENDENCE FOR THOSE WHO MIGHT BE ISOLATED BECAUSE OF TRANSPORTATION LAND USE DECISIONS. BUT WE ARE ON TRACK TO ACHIEVE THESE PUBLIC HEALTH BENEFITS THROUGH IMPLEMENTATION OF SB THREE SEVENTY FIVE AND WE WON'T BE WITHOUT STRUCTURAL CHANGES NECESSARY -- WE SUPPORT SB FIVE TWENTY SIX AS A WAY TO ADDRESS THE GROWTH IN TRANSPORTATION POLLUTION AND TO ADVANCE THE CONVERSATION BETWEEN LOCAL REGIONAL AND STATE. LEVEL STAKEHOLDERS TO GET US ON TRACK TO PLANNING INVESTING IN AND BUILDING HALTHIER COMMUNITIES FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS TO IMPROVE TO IMPROVE PUBLIC HEALTH. SOCIAL EQUITY AND SUSTAINABILITY OF OUR COMMUNITIES -- WITHOUT I HEARD YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU -- WELL OTHERS SPEAKERS IN FAVOR PLEASE SPEAKERS IN FAVOR OF THIS BILL.

RE A **** WITH THE SF COUNCIL SUPPORTERS OF ENERGY SEE IN SUPPORT [inaudible] BECAUSE THANK YOU NOW -- NO OTHER SUPPORTERS IF NOT -- LET'S HEAR OPPOSITION OR NEUTRAL OTHER POSITIONS. PLEASE COME FOR HAVE A SEAT THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU -- BILL AGAINST WHAT THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION COUNCILS FORGET OF GOVERNMENTS AND WE WANT TO THANK -- THE SENATOR FOR THE ROBUST DISCUSSION WE HAD IN A MISTER CHIN'S OFFICE BECAUSE I THOUGHT THAT THAT WAS VERY FRUITFUL WE APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENTS HE'S TAKING TODAY. WE ALSO APPRECIATE HOW ALL OPEN HIS OFFICE HAS BEEN WITH ALL THE CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE WE THINK THAT THERE'S A COUPLE OF WAYS THAT WE CAN MAKE THAT REPORT A LITTLE BETTER. AND I JUST WANT TO SAY AS THE METROPOLITAN PLANNING ORGANIZATIONS RESPONSIBLE WE ARE ARE GRAPPLING. WITH THE LARGER ISSUES HERE ABOUT HOW WE ACHIEVE CLIMATE CHANGE AND BUILD ENOUGH HOUSING UNITS AND DEAL WITH THE THOMAS VEHICLES AND EVERYTHING ELSE. WITH THE LIMITED AMOUNT OF AUTHORITY IT'S A LOT OF PLANNING AND CONSENSUS WITH LOCAL AGENCIES AND WE DO NEED. A LOT OF HELP AND ASSISTANCE FROM STATE. AND LOCAL PARTNERS IF WE'RE GONNA CHIEF ALL THESE GOALS AT THE SAME TIME AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO THE CONTINUED CONVERSATION. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS WHERE A TOP ON BEHALF OF THE ORANGE COUNTY TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY I'M WE DO HAVE AN OPPOSE POSITION BUT BUT TRULY WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO OR TO THE AUTHOR -- AND THE PROPONENTS AND AND YOUR STAFF -- FOR FOR TRULY SOME SOME PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATIONS -- VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENT THAT WAS TAKEN -- THE CHALLENGE THAT A TRANSPORTATION AGENCY LIKE US HAS WITH -- THIS BILL IS THE FACT THAT THIS IS ABOUT. A THE VERY REAL ISSUE OF HOW ARE WE MEETING OUR CLIMATE GOALS AND ONE OF THOSE REGIONAL DECISIONS THAT ARE BEING MADE IN THOSE LOCAL DECISIONS THAT ARE BEING MADE BUT AS A TRANSPORTATION AGENCY WE DON'T MAKE THOSE LAND USE DECISIONS. THOSE ARE NOT MADE BY TRANSPORTATION AGENCIES. THAT WILL OUR JOB IS TO MAKE SURE WE GIVE FULL MOBILITY OPTIONS FOR ALL OF OUR RESIDENTS OF ORANGE COUNTY NOT JUST THOSE THAT LIVE IN CERTAIN POCKETS SO THAT'S OUR CHALLENGE. I THINK GLOBALLY WITH THIS. AND THEN I'D ALSO LIKE TO JUST MENTION -- WE TALKED ABOUT THIS A LITTLE BIT AND MAYBE WE COULD WORK ON THIS GOING FORWARD AND THAT IS THE BILL DOES -- DISCUSS AND AND RELY ON V. M. T. AS A AS A SIGNIFICANT -- INDICATOR OF GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTIONS WE DON'T THINK THAT'S A GREAT BAROMETER OF OF WHETHER OR NOT WE'RE MEETING OUR GOALS WE HAVE A PROJECT IN ORANGE COUNTY THAT WERE INCREDIBLY PROUD OF ITS ON THE OC STREET CARTS A BRAND NEW TRANSIT SYSTEM NO ONE ELSE IS BUILDING NEW TRANSIT. OR BUILDING A BRAND NEW TRANSIT SYSTEM IT'S A ONE OF THE MOST -- THE DENSEST POPULATED AREAS OF THE STATE -- IN THE NATION IN SANTA ANA -- AND TECHNICALLY IT WOULD AT LEAST NARROWLY INCREASE V. M T. BECAUSE IT RE ROUTE TRAFFIC AND WE HAVE PEOPLE TRAVELING TO THE END POINTS. BY ALL ALL MEASURES THIS IS THAT THIS IS A PROJECT THAT I THINK THAT -- WE ALL WOULD AGREE IS IS GOING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION TERMS OF BUILDING MORE TRANSIT. SO WE WOULD LIKE THE WOULD LIKE TO CONTINUE THE DIALOGUE WE LOOK FORWARD TO AND WOULD LIKE TO CONSIDER -- THE AUTHOR TO CONSIDER -- BROADENING THE HOW WE MEET OUR GHG REDUCTIONS -- BROADER THAN VMT SO APPRECIATE YOUR TIME THANK YOU THANK YOU. SPEAKERS MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MARC WATTS REPRESENTING TRANSPORTATION CALIFORNIA WE'RE NOT EXACTLY OPPOSE WE CAME LATE TO THE CONVERSATION WITH THE AUTHORS OFFICE. EXPRESS SOME DEEP CONCERNS ABOUT THE STEP COMPONENT -- THAT WAS CONTAINED IN THE CURRENT BILL AND ARE VERY GRATEFUL FOR AT LEAST NOW TAKING THAT PIECE OUT AND LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU AS WE MOVE FORWARD. THANK YOU. BAKER THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS GOT SCORE BEHALF DISTINTAS COUNCIL GOVERNMENT'S TRANSPORTATION AGENCY FOR MONTEREY COUNTY WE ALSO HAVE BETWEEN YOUR POSITION JUST LIKE MISTER WATSON THAT'S BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T HAD THE BENEFIT. OF A CONVERSATION WITH THE AUTHOR -- I THINK THE TWO CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE IS NUMBER ONE WE WILL ME BACK UP WE DEFINITELY SHARE THE GOAL OF REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. THE COUNTIES THAT I REPRESENT TO HAVE SALES TAX MEASURES TO TRY TO PROVIDE MULTI MODAL OPTIONS IN ORDER TO WIN PEOPLE OFF OF THEIR DEPENDENCE ON THE VEHICLE -- THE CONCERN THAT WE HAVE HOWEVER THOUGH IS THAT WE DO NEED TO IMPROVE OUR INFRASTRUCTURE AND SO. WHAT WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE HAPPEN IS FOR SAFETY CONGESTION MANAGEMENT PROJECTS TO ALSO FALL BY THE WAYSIDE? AND SO WHAT I THINK MIGHT BE UPROOTED APPROACHES FOCUSING ON WHERE THOSE PEOPLE TRAVELING TO THEIR OFTEN TRAVELING TO THE JOB CENTERS AND SO FOR FOLKS THAT LIVE IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY WHICH IS IN A NON TEAM AN AIR DISTRICT. THOSE FIRST TO HAVE BEEN DRIVING TO THE BAY AREA BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THE JOBS ARE IN SO MAYBE FOCUSING ON INCENTIVES TO PROMOTE CREATE MORE JOBS WITHIN THE CENTRAL VALLEY STATE WE REDUCE VMT WE REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. AND THEN MAKING MORE INVESTMENTS AS THE LEGISLATURE HAS DONE WITH PASSENGER RAIL SERVICE COULD BE A REAL INCENTIVE IN ORDER TO PROVIDE THE TRUE MULTI MODAL -- SERVICE THAT WERE ALL LONGING -- TO IN ORDER TO VERY THANK YOU ME TO MEET THE GOAL SO THANKS X.. ONLY TWO SPEAKERS PER ITEM PLEASE OF OVER. EIGHT WHAT HAS SPENT SEVERAL WE TOTALLY CONCUR WITH IMPACT AND ALSO ISN'T CONCERNED MORE BRINGS UP A VERY VALID POINT. OF ROAD WITH REGARD TO ANOTHER. OF LOOK AT GMT AND WHAT PM T. DOES OR DOESN'T DO AS A BAROMETER BUT WE APPRECIATE FURTHER CONVERSATION LOVE TO CUT GOTTEN IN THE ROOM. WITH THE SENATOR RAND. AND BILL HAGENS BUT THANK YOU ACCORDING FROM THE DIALOGUE OKAY -- OKAY -- SO WE I I I AM RECOMMENDING THIS BILL WITH THE AMENDMENTS AUTHORED THREE TO THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS AND THAT ENTAILS THE THE ISSUE OF THE STATE OF BEING THE FOR THEM -- SIR -- AS WE HAVE SOME TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS ALSO. WE AGREE TO AND I WANT TO KNOW IF THERE'S ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE -- I SEE NO ANSWER ON THE ONE EIGHT ONE OF THINGS I THINK IS THE METROPOLITAN PLANNING ORGANIZATIONS WERE DESIGNED -- TO WORK WITH THE AIR REGIONAL AIR QUALITY BOARDS TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. AND THEN WE HAVE THE STATE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION. SUPPOSEDLY GOING TO WORK WITH -- STATE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION. AND DEVICE TRANSPORTATION PLANS REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION PLANS -- BUT IN THE DO THAT NAY THEY WORK TOGETHER ON THE PLANNING PART BUT THEY DON'T. THE PROBLEM IS THAT WHAT WE PLAN AND WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENS ARE TWO DIFFERENT THINGS BECAUSE OF THE ECONOMY. AND MORE JOBS COME IN ALL THE SUDDEN THERE'S MORE. DRIVE BEING OTHERS MORE POLLUTION LESS TRANSIT USAGE. A LOT OF FACTORS INFLUENCE -- YOUR ARE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND TRANSPORTATION SECTOR -- SO I THINK I THINK WE HAVE TO SET OURSELVES AND LOOK WHAT COULD HAVE THE THE GREATEST IMPACT THE BIGGEST BANG FOR YOUR BUCK OR BIGGEST RETURN ON YOUR INVESTMENT. IN EACH AREA EACH REGION. TO WHAT COULD -- REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. AND GET THE METROPOLITAN PLANNING ORGANIZATIONS. TO COMMIT TO THAT. AND IT AS YOU KNOW I I WAS ON THOUGH THE BAY AREA METROPOLITAN PLANNING COMMISSION WITH THE SERVER DODD AND OTHERS AND OTHER SENATORS. SIR WINNER -- EYES SERVED AS CHAIR AND I SERVED ON THERE FOR TWENTY ONE YEARS. AND I THINK THE THE DISCONNECT IS BETWEEN THE PLANNING. VERSUS THE FUNDING AND THE ACTION PART [inaudible] SO. THE PLANNING IS ALL GOOD BUT THEN YOU DON'T HAVE THE MONEY TO IMPLEMENT THE PLANS THAT ACTUALLY REDUCE TO GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS [inaudible] SO -- MY HOPE IS THAT WE CAN DEVISE. WITH THE WORK YOU'RE DOING. SOME KIND OF WAY OF CONNECTING THE TWO BETTER SO WE CAN. GET RESULTS PEOPLE WANT RESULTS THEY WANT TO THEY WANT TO SEE THE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS REDUCED. SO WE HAVE TO HAVE RESULTS SO. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS ON THAT -- BUT BE WILLING TO WORK WITH YOU ON THAT AND THE REGIONAL PLANNING AGENCIES OF COURSE AND OTHER OTHER LEGISLATORS YEAH I THINK ARE COMPLEX ISSUE THOUGH. DODD THAT WHENEVER SOME AS CHAIR AND I THINK THE REASON. WE LOOKED AT IN THE RESULT AFTER THE BILL WE LOOKED AT THAT AD STEP IS A WAY OF OF OF GETTING THERE I I GET THE CONCERNS THAT EXIST ABOUT USING THAT AS THE AS THE THE LEVERAGE. SO LET'S FIGURE OUT SOMETHING ELSE THAT THAT REALLY IS -- MEANINGFUL -- AND WHEN I SAY ME FOR A WHILE TO EFFECTUATE THE GOALS WE HAVE. AND WE LAY DOWN IT WE'VE BEEN MEDICALLY NOT BEEN ABLE TO MEET. I THINK THAT SOME WE CAN WORK ON I I HOPE THAT THE REGIONAL PLANNING AGENCIES WILL WORK WITH YOU ON THIS SENATOR. YEAH ANON DOES ANYBODY HAVE ANY COMMENTS OTHER. WE HAVE A MOTION WITH THE ACCEPTANCE WITH THE AMENDMENTS. SIR DODD A CENTERED ALLEN JULIE TO MAKE A CLOSING STATEMENT APPRECIATE THE DIALOGUE AND AND AND I I I I DO FEEL.

THANK YOU FOR INDULGING ME AND AND ALLOW ME TO PRESENT -- THEY CAN BECOME MEMBER -- MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS -- FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT THIS BILL TODAY. SB FOUR OH TWO IS A FIVE YEAR EXTENSION TO INYO COUNTIES ADVENTURE TRAIL PILOT PROGRAM. LOCATED IN SENATE-DISTRICT. EIGHT IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN AB SIX TO EIGHT ESTABLISHES PILOT PROGRAM WHICH ALLOWED INYO COUNTY TO DESIGNATE SPECIFIC COUNTY ROADS AS COMBINED USE ROUTES FOR OFF HIGHWAY VEHICLE USE. UNFORTUNATELY DUE TO IMPLEMENTATION DELAYS BY COURT ACTION. THERE HAS NOT BEEN ENOUGH TIME FOR A COMPREHENSIVE EVALUATION OF THE PILOT PROGRAM ITSELF. THE GOALS OF THIS PROGRAM ARE TO INCREASE TRAFFIC SAFETY. IMPROVE NATURAL RESOURCE PROTECTION REDUCE OFF HIGHWAY VEHICLE TRUCK TRESPASS ON PRIVATE LAND AND MINIMIZE IMPACTS ON COUNTY RESIDENTS. NEITHER THIS BILL NOR THE EXISTING PILOT PROGRAM CREATE A SINGLE NEW TRAIL OR WROTE. IT DOES HOWEVER CREATE A BETTER NETWORK OF TRAILS AND MORE IMPORTANTLY A LEGAL AND REGULATED MEANS TO ACCESS EXISTING MAINTAINED TRAILS THIS PROGRAM. PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN PROTECTING TRILLS AND LANDS FROM TRUCKS AND TRAILERS UNLOADING AND STAGING A TV VEHICLES BECAUSE NOW PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO ACCESS THE TRAILS FROM EXISTING PARKING LOTS BETTER CLOSER TO TOWN. ADDITIONALLY BY HAVING A LINK TO TRAIL SYSTEM. LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS THE TOOLS TO PROPERLY DIRECT OFF HIGHWAY VEHICLES -- H. V. USERS TO APPROVED ROUTES AND REDUCE THE NEED -- TO POLICE ILLEGAL ACTIVITY. THIS PROGRAM IS IMPORTANT TO LOCAL ECONOMY. INYO COUNTY WHICH CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF HIGH DESERT WITH LESS THAN 2% PRIVATELY OWNED LAND. HAS A ROBUST ATV -- H. B. COMMUNITY AND RELIES EXTENSIVELY ON TOURISM DOLLARS. THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS IN INYO RECENTLY VOTED UNANIMOUSLY IN SUPPORT OF THIS EXTENSION. I RESPECT TO RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE ON S. BEFORE -- TO MEMBERS I'D ALSO LIKE TO INTRODUCE INYO COUNTY SHERIFF JEFF HOLLOWELL. WHO IS HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT AND PAUL SMITH FOR MARCY RC THE RULE COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES OF CALIFORNIA?

I AM JUST FOLLOWING THE SHERIFF OF INYO COUNTY -- LIKE TO THANK SENATOR BARGES FOR SPONSORING US BEFORE -- TUNE FOR YOU ALLOW ME TO SPEAK. AND TWENTY TWELVE THE INCOMING MORE SUPERVISORS RECEIVED THIRTY EIGHT APPLICATIONS FOR COMBINED USED ROUTE. AFTER A RATHER THOROUGH AN EXHAUSTIVE -- APPLICATION HEARING PROCESS IN JANUARY OF TWENTY FIFTEEN WE WERE ABLE TO APPROVE SEVEN OF THOSE ROUTES. IN TWENTY SIXTEEN SB THIRTY FORTY OR EXCUSE ME THIRTEEN FORTY FIVE EXTENT OF THE PROJECT UNTIL JANUARY. TWENTY TWENTY OF THE SEVEN ROUTE THAT WERE APPROVED TO THOSE WERE OPEN UP IN JULY TWENTY FIFTEEN ONE ROUTE IN AUGUST OF TWENTY FIFTEEN THE REMAINING FOUR IN SEPTEMBER OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN SINCE THIS PILOT PROJECT OPEN NEITHER MY OFFICE MORE THE SIEGE PM RECEIVED. ANY REPORTS OF ACCIDENTS OR INJURIES RELATED TO ANY OF THE SEVEN COMBINED USED ROUTES. TO THE C. H. P. NOR MY OFFICE HAVE RECEIVED ANY FORMAL COMPLAINTS REGARDING THE ROUTES. WE CAN EVEN YOU IS NOT RECEIVED ANY REPORTS FROM. PARTNERING AGENCIES REGARDING DEGRADATION THE ANY OTHER IDENTIFIED ROUTES. THE ROUTES CURRENTLY CONSISTS OF APPROXIMATELY FORTY FOUR POINT SEVEN MILES THIRTY NINE OF WHICH ARE ACTUALLY PAVE ROADS -- THE WHICH FEES ARE ALREADY PERMITTED ON THE REMAINING TERM PORTIONS OF THOSE ROADS. WE HAVEN'T CHANGED ANYTHING THERE. LAST YEAR MY OFFICE PATROLLED OVER FIFTY FOUR HUNDRED MILES OF THESE ROUTES. MAKING PROBABLY SIX HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE CONTACTS WITH MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC. EACH ONE OF THOSE CONTACTS. ALLOWED US TO PROVIDE EDUCATIONAL OUTREACH AND PROVIDE GUIDANCE FOR SAFE AND RESPONSIBLE RECREATION. DURING THAT TIME NO CITATIONS WERE ISSUED. WITH THE PASSAGE OF AS BEFORE -- TO A NEW COUNTY WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO COMPLETE A COMPREHENSIVE EVALUATION ON THIS PILOT PROJECT. AND PRESENTED COMMITTEE WITH THE OUTCOMES OF THE EVALUATION. THE EVALUATION WOULD INCLUDE ECONOMIC BENEFITS THE PUBLIC SAFETY OUTCOMES AND REDUCTION OR EACH BE INCURSIONS ON TO NON OHP AREAS. ALEX TAKE YOU ARE THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND CONSIDERATION AND I WOULD URGE AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SIR OUR NEXT WITNESS MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS PAUL SMITH WITH THE REAL COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES -- WE REPRESENT THE RURAL COUNTIES OF OF THE STATE INCLUDING IN YOU KNOW WE WERE VERY INVOLVED IN THE INITIAL CRAFTING OF THIS BILL IN THE EXTENSION WE JUST NEED A LITTLE MORE TIME TO SEE IF THIS IS A VIABLE PROGRAM -- AS LIMITED AS THAT MAY BE AND WE'RE HOPING THAT THE LEGISLATURE GRANTS IS THAT AND WE CAN DO ANOTHER STUDY OF THE STUDY HAS BEEN DELIVERED TO THE LEGISLATURE'S REQUIRED IN THE PREVIOUS AUTHORIZATION LOOK FOR TO A MORE COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW. OF ONCE WE HAVE THAT TIME TO DO THAT EVALUATION. THANK YOU OF WITNESSES IN FAVOR PLEASE COME FOR A WITNESSES -- I SEE NON OKAY -- WITNESSES OPPOSING THE BILL PLEASE COME -- FOR RIGHT HERE PLEASE OVER HERE. YEAH RIGHT HERE [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. YES SIR YOU'RE THE FOR GERMAN GOVERNMENT. THE PHONE NUMBER ON YOUR CLOSER WHICH BUTTON THE GREEN BUTTON. THANKS VERY ON THANK YOU THANK YOU SIR BERMAN BELL AND TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE MEMBERS. MY NAME IS STEVE WHITE. I'M A LONG TIME RESIDENT OF BISHOP WHICH IS THE LARGEST TOWN IN INYO COUNTY. THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK AND BE PART OF THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS I AM HUMBLED BUT HONORED TO BE HERE. SENATE BILL FOR A TWO IS A CONTROVERSIAL ISSUE IN INYO COUNTY. THE BILL WOULD CIRCUMVENT THE STATE MOTOR VEHICLE CODE ALLOWING ALL OFF HIGHWAY VEHICLES TO DRIVE ON PAVED COUNTY ROADS TO LET DRIVE TO LET RIDERS CONVENIENTLY DRIVE INTO TOWNS. THIS PILOT PROGRAMS CALLED ADVENTURE TRAILS AND IT HAS THE STATED INTENT OF PROMOTING -- EACH V. TOURISM IN INYO COUNTY. I SPEAK FOR MANY WHO ARE ADAMANTLY AGAINST THIS PROGRAM. AND I TRUST THAT YOU ALL RECEIVED THE PACKETS OF LETTERS SENT BY THIRTY OF OUR CONCERNED CITIZENS. LET ME BE CLEAR WE ACCEPT LEGAL AND RESPONSIBLE USE OF OFF ROAD VEHICLES BY LOCALS AS BEING PART OF THE RECREATION MIX. IT IS THE PROMOTION OF IT AS A TOURIST DRAW THAT IS ALARMING. THE ECONOMY OF OUR AREA IS HEAVILY DEPENDENT UPON NON MOTORIZED OUTDOOR RECREATION BY TOURISTS. THESE INCLUDE HIKING ROCK CLIMBING BACKPACKING FISHING PHOTOGRAPHY BIRD WATCHING HORSEBACK RIDING SKIING AND GENERAL SIGHTSEEING. WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE POSSIBLE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF THIS PROJECT ON OUR ECONOMY. THAT'S CALIFORNIA'S POPULATION BECOMES EVER GREATER. OUR COUNTY VAST UNPOPULATED LANDSCAPES BECOME EVER MORE DESIRABLE FOR THOSE MILLIONS WHO ARE SEEKING QUIET PURSUITS. WE ARE EIGHT YEARS INTO THIS PILOT PROGRAM WHEN THIS IS APPROVED BY OUR COUNTY SUPERVISORS WE WERE TOLD THAT THERE WOULD BE A MONITORING PROGRAM. DIALOGUE ABOUT MITIGATION EFFICIENT AND COMPREHENSIVE WAYS TO IDENTIFY YOU LEGAL USE. AND THAT THE PUBLIC WOULD BE KEPT INFORMED OF THE STATUS OF THIS PROGRAM. THE STEPS WERE NEVER TAKEN. AS A CASE IN POINT. THE CURRENT BILL SENATE BILL THIRTEEN FORTY FIVE CALL FOR AND I QUOTE. AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PUBLIC COMMENT AT A PUBLIC HEARING HELD BY THE COUNTY IN ORDER TO EVALUATE THE PILOT PROJECT. THIS DEDICATED THIS DEDICATED HEARING NEVER HAPPENED. PROPONENTS OF SAID THAT THE PILOT PROGRAM SHOULD BE COULD CONTINUE BECAUSE THERE WERE DELAYS IN IMPLEMENTATION. WELL ONE REASON THERE WERE DELAYS WAS THAT THE ORIGINALLY PLANNED THIRTY SEVEN ROUTES MET WITH STIFF OPPOSITION AND FINALLY HAD TO BE TRIMMED BACK TO SEVEN ROUNDS BEFORE BEING APPROVED. IN YOUR COUNTIES OPEN LAND IS VIRTUALLY ALL PUBLIC. BILL IN FOR A SERVICE AND NATIONAL PARKS. BY THEIR OWN ADMISSION THESE AGENCIES ARE UNABLE TO DEAL WITH MONITORING EVEN THE CURRENT LEVEL OF EACH BE ACTIVITY. KNOWING THAT -- EACH V. USE. HAS A MUCH HIGHER IMPACT THE NON MOTORIZED USE HOW CAN WE EXPECT THEM TO MONITOR AN EMPHASIS PROGRAM LIKE ADVENTURE TRAILS. I RESPECTFULLY BUT URGENTLY ASK YOU TO VOTE AGAINST THIS BILL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH [inaudible] FOR THANK YOU. TERM HOW. THANK YOU MEMBERS. MY NAME'S DAN CONNER AM AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL MUSIC TEACHER. IN BISHOP CALIFORNIA. JUST A WEEK AGO THE SENATE THE CALIFORNIA SENATE PASSED TWO BILLS TO MITIGATE THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE. SB FOUR HUNDRED IS ATTEMPTING TO ELIMINATE GROSSLY POLLUTING VEHICLES FROM OUR ROADS AND HIGHWAYS. A GREAT IDEA BUT I HAVE TO TELL YOU THOSE CLUNKERS AREN'T NEARLY AS DIRTY AS THE VEHICLES. THAT SB FOUR OH TWO IS INVITING EN MASSE. THE ANNUAL COUNTY. THE CALIFORNIA REESE AIR RESOURCES BOARD SAYS THE CLEANEST BURNING -- H. B. POLLUTES THE EQUIVALENT OF THIRTY PASSENGER CARS. AND THE DIRTIEST AS MUCH AS SEVEN HUNDRED PASSENGER CAR. THE PASSAGE OF SB FORTY FIVE ENABLES CALIFORNIA TO PREPARE FOR ONE OF THE MAJOR EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE WILD FIRES. SENATOR DODD. I BELIEVE. WELL MAYBE IT HERE. IS CONCERNED ENOUGH ABOUT WILDFIRES TO AUTHOR TWO PIECES OF LEGISLATION ABOUT THEM. SO HE KNOWS THAT THE MOST WILDFIRES. THAT MOST WILD FIRES ARE CAUSED BY HUMANS. AND MISUSE OF GASOLINE POWERED EQUIPMENT SUCH AS CHAIN SAWS FARM EQUIPMENT AND H. P.. ARE COMMON OFFENDERS FROM THAT GROUP. THE MOST POPULAR -- H. B. THE POLARIS RAZOR HAS HAD OVER HALF A MILLION RECALLS IN THE LAST FEW YEARS MANY BECAUSE THEY SPONTANEOUSLY BURST INTO FLAMES. DOES IT MAKE ANY SENSE TO TRY AND ATTRACT LARGE OR EVEN SMALL NUMBERS OF THESE VEHICLES TO A COUNTY WHICH IS FULL OF CHAPARRAL AND SUBJECT TO WILD FIRE. IN YOUR COUNTIES TRIED FOR EIGHT YEARS TO GET THIS PILOT PROGRAM UP AND RUNNING MILLIONS OF TAXPAYER DOLLARS VIA THE O. H. P. TRUST FUND HAVE BEEN SPENT. IN ADDITION TO HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS FROM INYO COUNTY TAXPAYERS. WE DON'T UNDERSTAND THEIR INSISTENCE. WE DON'T UNDERSTAND THE INSISTENCE OF OUR SUPERVISORS TO THROW GOOD MONEY AFTER BAD. AND THEY AREN'T EXPLAINING IT TO US IN FACT IT SEEMS THEY ARE AVOIDING THE PUBLIC'S INVOLVEMENT. WE HAD A PUBLIC HEARING IN JANUARY OF TWENTY THIRTEEN AND HAVEN'T HAD ONE SINCE -- AS YOU CAN YOU WRAP IT UP WE WE HAVE THE RULES TWO MINUTES PER SPEAKER. FIRST TWO TWO SPEAKERS AND TWO MINUTES FOR EACH BY ALREADY GONE TO MEN. THANK YOU I'M SORRY. BERMAN CAN I JUST SAY THAT -- WE'RE NOT PROFESSIONAL POLITICIANS WERE JUST ORDINARY CITIZENS EXHAUSTED FROM BATTLING THIS THING FOR EIGHT YEARS. AND OUR INTEREST IS SIMPLY TO PLEAD FROM OUR HEARTS TO PLEASE HOLD THE PRINCIPLES THE PROPONENTS. ARE ASKING YOU TO A BAND. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR -- OTHERS SPEAKERS NOT IN FAVOR OF THIS PROPOSAL. BRENDA WIKI CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. AND ALSO FOR SIERRA CALIFORNIA ALSO ENOUGH IS OPPOSITION. LYNN BOLTON I'M THE CHAIR OF THE LOCAL -- SIERRA CLUB FOR IMMUNE MONO COUNTY THE RANGE OF LIKE GROUP OF THE TOTALITY CHAPTER OF THE SIERRA CLUB [inaudible] OUR WE ARE OPPOSED TO THIS PILOT PROGRAM BECAUSE IT INDUCES MORE -- HV RECREATION ACTIVITY ON PUBLIC LANDS WITHOUT AN ADEQUATE ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT OF THE IMPACTS ON PUBLIC LANDS. AND ON NON -- HVAC RECREATION THANK YOU. M. HOLLAND OF FROM WESTERN ROAD IN BISHOP OF FORMER VOLUNTEER FIREFIGHTERS. I AM VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE SAFETY OF THE OVERAGE FEES AS HAS BEEN MENTIONED. ALL THEY DON'T BELONG. ON OUR ROADS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR HEARING US. OF OKAY -- THEY HAVE QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS -- PERCENT OKAY THERE'S A MOTION. OF FRICTION ROSS ROSS SO CENTER STONE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN -- SHERIFF -- IF THE IF THE OPPONENTS TO GET THEIR WAY AND AND WE REALLY LIMIT OFF ROAD HIGHWAY VEHICLE. OPPORTUNITIES AND IN YOUR COUNTY -- WHAT DO YOU THINK THE RESULT WILL BE DO THINK TOLD? ME A LOT OF OFF ROADERS UTILIZING. HABITAT AREAS THAT ARE MUCH MORE SENSITIVE AND WILL CREATE A PUBLIC SAFETY NIGHTMARE FOR YOU AS FAR AS HAVING OFFICERS WRITING CITATIONS AND YOU SEE THE POINT IN TRYING TO MAKE. YES -- I I BELIEVE IF IF WE DO NOT. CONTINUE WITH THIS PILOT PROGRAM. BASICALLY WHAT THIS IS GOING TO DO THAT PUSHES EVERYBODY WITH THEIR VEHICLES AND TRAILERS OUT INTO SPACES WERE NORMALLY PEOPLE LIKE TO GO OUT AND RIDE HORSES AND WALK AND HIKE AND HUNT AND FISH. AND WE'RE GONNA PUSH THEM INTO THAT AREA. NOT ONLY THAT BUT THEN YOU'RE GONNA HAVE THE ILLEGAL USE THAT COMES WITH THAT WHICH IS GOING TO CREATE YOU KNOW MORE PROBLEMS FOR FOR MY DEPARTMENT AS WELL AS I WOULD CONTROL. BECAUSE THEY ACTUALLY INVESTIGATE ACCIDENTS YEAH THAT THAT'S MY CONCERN MISTER CHAIRMAN BECAUSE WE HAVE TO HAVE. CERTAIN AREAS IN THE STATE WHERE PEOPLE CAN RIGHT THERE -- H. FEES DISLIKES PEOPLE HAVE FISHING HOBBIES AND WANT TO DO IT AND IF WE RESTRICT. OF THE AVAILABILITY OF PLACES FOR THESE PEOPLE SAFE YOU'RE RIGHT A RECREATIONAL VEHICLES WITHOUT FEAR OF WARRANTED OR INCOMPATIBILITY IS WAS EQUESTRIANS AND WE'RE WE'RE GOING TO CREATE A LOT MORE PROBLEMS IN THE CITY CALIFORNIA SORRY. I SUPPORT THE MOTION AND THERE'S MY COLLEAGUES TO SUPPORT THE SAME THING. HOME OTHER QUESTIONS -- MAYBE THE RESPOND TO SOME OF THOSE CONCERNS SO OF TURN OF YOU FOR YOUR CLOTHES THANK YOU AND HELD ON TO SOME OF THE AND I'LL BE BRIEF -- I WANT TO THANK -- MR DAN CONNOR MISTER STEVE WHITE AND OTHERS. WHO CAME OUT TO SPEAK ON THIS MATTER -- I KNOW THERE ARE SOME PHILOSOPHICAL DIFFERENCES THAT WE'VE HEARD BUT I THINK THE MOST TELLING. IS THE STATEMENT MADE THAT THEY HAVE BEEN FIGHTING THIS FOR EIGHT YEARS. THAT'S PRECISELY WHY THE PILOT PROGRAM HAS NOT BEEN IMPLEMENTED. AND I THINK WHEN YOU HAVE THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS AND YOU HAVE THE SHARE OF AND THE CONSTITUENCY THAT IS ASKING FOR THOSE TAX. DOLLARS THAT HAVE BEEN PUT INTO THIS INVESTMENT. TO REVEAL THE MERITS OF THIS PROGRAM. I THINK IT'S ONLY APPROPRIATE THAT WE LET THE MERITS OF THIS PROGRAM REVEALED THEMSELVES. UP FOR THIS -- FOR THE REMAINDER OF THIS PROPOSED PILOT PERIOD -- WE MAY FIND THAT -- THAT -- THIS PROGRAM MAY NOT BE WORTH PURSUING. WE SUSPECT HOWEVER AS THE SHERIFF MENTIONED THAT WE DO NOT WANT ENCOURAGE FOLKS TO DRIVE THEIR OFF ROAD VEHICLES. INTO PRISTINE ENVIRONMENTAL LANDS THAT'S PRECISELY THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT'S OCCURRING HERE E. HAVING DUAL USE ROAD ROADS IS GOING TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT WE PROTECT OUR ENVIRONMENT. AND MAKE CERTAIN THAT -- WHAT WE LOOK AFTER THE INTERESTS OF -- INYO COUNTY. THANK YOU WILL MOTION ON THE FLOOR AND MORE QUESTIONS. OF OKAY THANK YOU OF CENTER WILL CALL THE ROLL PLEASE THIS IS AN ABOUT FOUR OH TWO BY SENATOR BARGES THE MOTION IS TO PASS AND REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON NATURAL RESOURCES ON WATER.

SIR CABALLERO YOU OF ONE BILL -- I HAVE TO SAY SENATOR -- WE PUT -- PRINT A A BY PASS BILL ON THE CONSENT CALENDAR. AND IT WAS APPROVED BECAUSE I THINK THIS COMMITTEES VOTED ON THAT. HOW MANY TIMES IS THAT BILL A FULL TIME I THINK IT'S AT LEAST A COUPLE TIMES FOR A MORE IN THAT -- DISPENSER ROLL PRINT A A BY PASS BILLS OVER THE YEARS. KLAY ONE LAST YEAR AND NOW NOW THIS ONE SO -- WE PUT THAT ON THE CONSENT CALENDAR. SO YOU'RE ON SB -- THREE SEVENTY ONE ON SCHOOL BUSES AND ALL TURN THE FLOOR OVER YOU CENTER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- MR AT CENTER CHAIR FOR MISTER CHAIR-- AND SENATORS I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT SB. THREE SEVENTY ONE THE BILL THAT ADDRESSES THE ALARMING NUMBER OF SCHOOL CHILDREN STRUCK BY VEHICLES WHILE GOING TO AND FROM THEIR SCHOOL BUS. LET ME START BY THINKING THE COMMITTEE FOR WORKING WITH ME ON AMENDMENTS AND WE WILL BE ACCEPTING THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS. DURING EVERY SCHOOL DAY IN CALIFORNIA SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND CHILDREN RIGHT A SCHOOL BUS TO AND FROM SCHOOL. ACCORDING TO THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF PEOPLE TRANSPORTATION SERVICES THERE ARE TWENTY ONE THOUSAND DRIVERS IN CALIFORNIA. NOR THE STATE'S SCHOOL BUS STOP LAW AS A SPEED BY SCHOOL BUSES AS CHILDREN APPROACH -- EXIT THIS BILL WOULD AMEND THE CALIFORNIA VEHICLE CODE TO PROVIDE SCHOOL DISTRICTS THE OPTION TO INCORPORATE SCHOOL BUS STOPS Là VIDEO TECHNOLOGY. THIS TECHNOLOGY WOULD HELP LAW ENFORCEMENT STOP VIOLATIONS SB THREE SEVENTY ONE CONTAINS PRIVACY. JUDICIAL PROCESS SIGNAGE REQUIREMENTS AND PUBLIC EDUCATION EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS BEFORE VIDEO TECHNOLOGY CAN BE UTILIZED. THE BILL ALSO PROTECTS SCHOOL BUS DRIVERS AS WELL AS SCHOOL EMPLOYEES FOR MANY INCREASED LIABILITY ASSOCIATED WITH VIDEO TECHNOLOGY DEPLOYED ON THE BUS THEY ARE DRIVING. THESE PRACTICES ARE TAKEN FROM SIXTEEN OTHER STATES WHO HAVE SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTED VIDEO TECHNOLOGY. CALIFORNIA HAS TRAFFIC SAFETY LAWS IN PLACE FOR THE SAFETY OF CHILDREN. THE LAW REQUIRES DRIVERS TO PAY ATTENTION TO THE FLASHING RED LIGHTS AND AND THE STOP ARM ON SCHOOL BUSES. DRIVERS BY LAW ARE REQUIRED TO STOP BEHIND THE SCHOOL BUS WHEN DRIVING IN THE SAME DIRECTION AS A BUS. AND BEFORE A BUS WHEN DRIVING IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION. THE FACT THAT CHILDREN TODAY CONTINUE TO BE STRUCK BY DRIVERS WHO DO NOT FOLLOW THE LAW INDICATES THAT MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE. AND THIS BILL PROVIDES SCHOOL DISTRICT WITH THE POTENTIAL SOLUTION IF THEY WISH TO USE IT. THANK YOU AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I'VE WITH ME TODAY IS STEVE BORROW REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA COALITION FOR CHILDREN SAFETY AND HEALTH AND LIBBY SANCHES REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE ANY OTHER CENTERS OF THE COMMITTEE -- MY NAME IS THE BARREL I AM THE PROJECT DIRECTOR FOR THE CALIFORNIA COALITION FOR CHILDREN'S SAFETY AND HEALTH I'M ALSO THE STATE COURT CHAIR OF THE CALIFORNIA UNINTENTIONAL INJURY PREVENTION STRATEGIC PLAN PROJECT WHICH IS WHAT I'M NOT JUST A LONG. WAY OF JUST SAYING WERE CHARGED WITH TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET DROWNING POISONING FALLS ON A WINDOWS TRAFFIC TEEN DRIVER -- ISSUES TAKEN CARE OF IN THE STATE SO THAT IS NOT THE LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH AND HOSPITALIZATION OR STATE. THIS BILL IS AN AWFULLY IMPORTANT BILL BUT IT'S A TOUGH -- ONE WE OF ADDED FOR OVER THE YEARS A NUMBER OF THINGS IS THE SENATOR HAS HAS IDENTIFIED -- FLASHING LIGHTS STOP ARMS -- WE'VE -- IN ELEVATED AT THE DMV ON THE DRIVER TOUTS THE IMPORTANCE OF STOPPING BEHIND THE BOSS IN IN FRONT OF THE BUS. YET NOW WE'RE UP TO THREE POINT SEVEN MILLION VIOLATIONS A YEAR AND THESE ARE NOT CARS CREEPING BY THE BUS THESE ARE. THESE ARE CARS SPEEDING BY A SCHOOL BUS -- WE HAD THERE'S A DISAGREEMENT ABOUT HOW MANY TIMES CHILDREN ARE HIT IN OUR STATE BUT WE HAD WENT BACK AND HAD THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY GO INTO OUR OWN YOU SEE H. P.. SWEATERS COLLISION DATA WE IDENTIFIED A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE TIMES IN THE LAST TEN YEARS THAT CHILDREN HAVE BEEN HIT. SO SOME WILL FATAL SEVERAL SERIOUS BUT THERE'S A DISAGREEMENT ABOUT THAT BUT BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY WE HAVE SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND CHILDREN AND THESE ARE CHILDREN FROM PREDOMINANTLY LOW INCOME NEIGHBORHOODS. USING THE BUS SYSTEM BECAUSE OUR PARENTS ARE WORKING TO GO TO SCHOOL AND YET WE ARE ALLOWING THREE POINT. SEVEN DODD MILLION DRIVERS TO SPEED BY THEIR BOSSES IT'S WERE CREATING A SITUATION WHERE IT IS WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A STOP LAW. ON OUR BOOKS WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT OKAY WHAT ELSE DO WE NEED TO DO TO PROTECT THESE CHILDREN THIS IS A SERIOUS THIS IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM. SO WE'RE SPONSORING THIS LEGISLATION AFTER LOOKING AT SIXTEEN OTHER STATES WERE TAKING THE VERY BEST PRACTICES AND PIECES OF THE VERY BEST PRACTICES IN OTHER STATES. TO PUT INTO OUR VEHICLE CODE THE STRUCTURE THAT COSTS US CALIFORNIA'S WOULD LIKE TO SEE IF A SCHOOL DISTRICT DECIDES ON ITS OWN THAT IT WANTS TO TRY TO USE THIS TO PROTECT ITS CHILDREN. THIS DOES NOT REQUIRED TO DO IT BUT IT DOES GET US GOING DOWN THE ROAD OF WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE WHAT ARE THE PRIVACY RIGHTS WHAT ARE THE RIGHTS OF THAT SCHOOL EMPLOYEES. OF THE DRIVERS OF THE STUDENTS -- HOW DO WE PAY FOR IT ALL THAT IS BUILT INTO THIS BUT YOU CAN'T SHARE THIS DATA WITH ANYBODY BUT THE TRAFFIC ENFORCEMENT DIVISION IN THAT JURISDICTION? SO THERE'S A LOT OF DETAIL IN THIS BILL THERE'S GONNA BE A LOT MORE WE JUST TOOK SOME MORE -- GOOD AMENDMENTS ABOUT NOT INCENTIVIZING ANY OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO WRITE A INCENTIVE IS ATION CONTRACT WITH THE VENDOR. BUT WE'RE FACED WITH SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND KIDS. THAT WE'RE SETTING A MOP. TO BE NERVOUS AND SCARED SIMPLE BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING TO THEIR SCHOOL BUSES AND THEY ARE GETTING HIT BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY. THOUSANDS OF THEM DON'T GET HERE BUT THEY HAVE TO DODGE THE CARS AND THAT'S NOT RIGHT AND I THINK IS A STATE WE CAN DO BETTER AND THIS IS A GOOD STEP FORWARD FOR FRAMING UP. ANOTHER WAY OF DOING IT SIXTEEN STATES A MOVE FORWARD THEY'RE GETTING A 40% AND A 50% REDUCTION IN THEIR IN THEIR VIOLATIONS AND I GO THROUGH THAT DETAIL IF YOU WANT TO ASK BUT THANK YOU FOR HEARING THE BILL WE HOPE YOU MOVE IT FORWARD WERE TRIPLE REFERRED BE. OUT TO MORE COMMITTEES TO GO THROUGH I'M SURE THEY'LL BE MORE MORE AMENDMENTS TO TIGHTEN UP HOW THIS WORKS FOR US IN CALIFORNIA AND AGAIN SCHOOLS DO NOT WE'RE NOT TELLING THEM THEY HAVE TO USE THIS. YEAH BUT ON ANYWAY SO THANK YOU. THE NEXT WITNESSES WOULD BE SANTOS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL EMPLOYEES IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE ONE EXPRESSED APPRECIATION TO THE AUTHOR FOR ACCEPTING AMENDMENTS TO CLARIFY. THAT THE PURPOSE OF THE VIDEO TECHNOLOGY WILL BE USED CURRENTLY FOR THE PURPOSE FOR WHICH IT WAS INTENDED NOT FOR EMPLOYEE DISCRIMINATION -- AS WAS. ILLUSTRATED IN THE ANALYSIS OUR SCHOOL BUS DRIVERS THAT WE REPRESENT ARE TASKED WITH STATUTORY RESPONSIBILITIES FOR CROSSING KIDS ACROSS THE STREET. IN ADDITION TO THOSE RESPONSIBILITIES AND THE RESPONSIBILITIES WITH WHICH THEIR IMPARTED JUST TRANSPORTING KIDS THEY TAKE THESE RESPONSIBILITIES VERY VERY SERIOUSLY. THE PROBLEM IS OTHER DRIVERS DON'T ARM. I KNOW THAT THIS BODY DOES NOT LEGISLATE BY ANECDOTE BUT I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO HELP INFORM THE CONVERSATION IF I SHARE MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE AS A MOM WHO WALKS HER THREE KIDS ACROSS THE STREET. TO SCHOOL ALL RIGHT WHEN THE SCHOOL BUSES ARE PARKED THERE SO THE SCHOOL BUSES ARE PARKED THERE I'M WALKING IN A DESIGNATED CROSSING LOCK. THERE IS A CROSSING GUARD THERE IN YELLOW BLAZER AND STOP SIGN AND I CANNOT COUNT THE NUMBER OF TIMES I'M NOT I'M NOT KIDDING I CANNOT COUNT THE NUMBER OF TIMES. SOMEONE HAS DISOBEYED THE LAW AND SPED THROUGH THE CROSSWALK WHILE I AM TRYING TO WALK MY CHILD. WITH THEIR HAND ACROSS THE STREET SO THIS DOESN'T JUST INCREASED SAFETY FOR THOSE KIDS RIDING THE SCHOOL BUSES A GUARANTEE IT'LL INCREASE SAFETY FOR THOSE KIDS WHO ARE TRYING TO BE TRANSPORED ACROSS THE STREET AS WELL. FOR THOSE REASONS RUN STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU -- THANK YOU A WE HAVE OTHER PEOPLE IT'S SUPPORT THIS BILL PLEASE. MISTER CHAIRMAN WAS KATHY BRING IN CALIFORNIA COALITION FOR CHILDREN SAFETY AND HEALTH IN SUPPORT A OTHER SUPPORTERS PLEASE -- WE HEAR ANY OPPOSITION FOR THE BILL PLEASE COME FOR OPPOSITION -- HAVE A SEAT WELCOME. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MIKE A DOCTOR OFF ON BEHALF OF THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA REGRETFULLY IN OPPOSITION TO THE SPELL -- WE RECOGNIZE AND APPRECIATE THE VERY IMPORTANT GOAL OF PROTECTING CHILDREN HOWEVER WE HAVE A NUMBER OF PRIVACY CONCERNS RELATED TO THIS BILL. ANY TIME AT THE GOVERNMENT IMPLEMENTS A NEW SYSTEM FOR THE AUTOMATED COLLECTION OF LARGE AMOUNTS OF DATA. SUCH AS THE USE OF RED LIGHT CAMERAS OR THE AUTOMATED SCHOOL BUS VIDEO ENFORCEMENT SYSTEMS. THAT WOULD BE AUTHORIZED BY THIS BILL. THERE IS A DANGER TO INDIVIDUAL PRIVACY. AND WHILE WE APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S INCLUSION OF SOME LIMITATIONS ON PROTECTIONS SB THREE SEVENTY ONE STILL FAILS TO PUT IN PLACE BASIC NECESSARY PROTECTIONS TO PREVENT THE MISUSE OF THE INFORMATION GATHERED. FOR EXAMPLE SB THREE SEVENTY ONE DOES NOT INCLUDE PROTECTIONS AGAINST THE USE OF AUTOMATED LICENSE PLATE READER TECHNOLOGY WHICH CAN BE USED TO COMPILE DATABASES OF INFORMATION. CAPTURED BY A SCHOOL BUS CAMERA THAT CAN THEN BE USED TO TRACK THE LOCATIONS OF VEHICLES AND THE PEOPLE ASSOCIATED WITH THOSE VEHICLES. NOR DOES THE BILL PROHIBIT THE SCHOOL DISTRICT FROM SHARING THE INFORMATION COLLECTED ALTHOUGH THE VENDORS THEY CONTRACT WITH ARE SUBJECT TO THAT RESTRICTION. THE DANGERS OF COLLECTING THE DATA ARE HEIGHTENED BY THE NINETY DAY RETENTION PERIOD FOR THE RECORDINGS. FAR LONGER THAN IS NECESSARY FOR THE PURPOSE OF ENFORCING THE LAW. AND LIKE I SAID WE AGAIN RECOGNIZE AND APPRECIATE THAT THE VERY IMPORTANT GOALS OF THIS LEGISLATION BUT WE UNFORTUNATELY MUST OPPOSE IT BASED ON THESE PRIVACY CONCERNS THANK YOU. OKAY OTHERS SPEAKERS OPPOSING. I DON'T SEE ANY [inaudible] OF OKAY -- SIR RAFEAL QUESTION. STILL. THERE STONE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I'M -- CERTAINLY SUPPORTIVE OF THE CONCEPT I'M. FRANKLY FRIGHTENED BY THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO. DISREGARD RED LIGHTS BOTH IN. CITIES AND EARLIER AROUND THE SCHOOL TRANSPORTATION VEHICLES AND IN MY EXPERIENCE I'VE BEEN A FEW CITIES IN MY FAIRLY LONG LIFE AND FRANKLY THIS ONCE THE WORST. BUT LET ME ASK A QUESTION ABOUT THE PROCESS FOR DEALING WITH THE VIDEO CAPTURES SO. I'M FAMILIAR WITH VIDEO -- AND PHOTOS THAT ARE TAKEN HAVE BEEN TAKEN BY THE CITY RED LIGHT CAMERAS. AND THE FIDELITY IS PRETTY GOOD. AND THE PHOTOS ARE OF BOTH THE VEHICLE AND THE DRIVER IN THE VEHICLE. SO. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE AMENDMENTS CHANGED TO PUT A NOTE IN THE ANALYSIS IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE THE VIDEO CAPTURE IS GOING TO BE OF THE VEHICLE NONE OF THE PASSENGERS OR THE DRIVERS AT THE CASE. YEAH THESE THESE CATS THESE CAMERAS ARE DIFFERENT THAN THE THAN THE INTERSECTION CAMPUSES ALSO IS A CIVIL CITATION -- THAT'S BEING -- CONTEMPLATED IN THE BILL AND THE CIVIL CITATION IS DIFFERENT IT IS -- CITATION AGAINST THE VEHICLE SO LIKE YOU OTHER CITATIONS LIKE A PARKING TICKET OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO ASSIGN SO IF YOU GET A CIVIL CITATION ON YOU YOU SPEED PAST THE BUS CAMERA TAKES THE PHOTOGRAPH OF THE VEHICLE LAW ENFORCEMENT DETERMINES AL THAT WAS A VIOLATION THEY SEND YOU A CITATION. HE SAID WELL THAT WAS MY NEIGHBOR DRIVING MY CAR THAT DAY OR THAT WAS MY SON YOU ARE ALLOWED TO ASSIGN AND THE LAW ENFORCEMENT MUST BY CURRENT STATUTE IN CODE. THEY MUST RE ASSIGN THE TICKET OR THE CITATION OVER -- THE IT IS NOT THE SAME AS IF A TRAFFIC OFFICER OR RED LIGHT CAMERA CAUGHT YOU IN AN INTERSECTION IT'S NOT THE SAME AS IF A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER PULLS YOU OVER -- IAN WITNESSES YOU DOING THIS THAT'S A WHOLE DIFFERENT BALLGAME. SO DO THE THE AMENDMENTS CONTEMPLATE. TO OF A LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY REVIEWING THE VIDEO CAPTURE. DOES THAT MEAN THE AGENCY HAS THE DISCRETION TO DEEM A VIOLATION NOT TO HAVE OCCURRED UNDER THE VEHICLE CODE. YES. THEY DO AND WHAT'S THE TIME LIMIT FOR THE TIME FRAME IN WHICH SHOULD SOMEONE WHO'S VEHICLE IS UTILIZED IN AN IMPROPER WAY. WHAT'S THE TIME LINE TO A DUTY ASSIGNMENT. RIGHT NOW IN THE BILL THEY HAVE NINETY DAYS TO RETAIN THE VIDEO -- ACLU IS ASKING FOR THAT TO BE SHORTER BECAUSE AND WE AGREE WITH THEM WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS IS ONLY USE FOR TRAFFIC VIA THIS SPECIFIC. TRAFFIC VIOLATION AND SO -- WE'VE ALREADY SPOKEN TO THE AUTHOR ABOUT AMENDING THE BILL AND TIGHTENING DOWN THAT -- THE TIME FRAME HOUSE TO BE MUCH SHORTER BECAUSE IT IS JUST A CIVIL CITATION -- THAT -- THAT THE VIN THE THAT VIDEO IN FILMS ARE DESTROYED IN LAS THE DRIVER HAS A RIGHT TO SEE -- MANASSE FORM BUT NOBODY ELSE HAS A RIGHT TO GET THROUGH THOSE THAT THAT INFORMATION AND THAT HAS TO BE TIGHTENED UP IN THE BILL. ABOUT -- THAT IT CAN'T BE SHARED BEYOND THE TRAFFIC ENFORCEMENT ENTITY THAT IS DOING THE DETERMINATION IN THAT JURISDICTION ONLY -- SO THE THERE IS SOME WORK TO DO ON SHORTENING THE TIME FRAME BUT RIGHT NOW THE BILL HAS A NINETY DAY -- ACLU IS SAYING THAT'S TOO LONG BECAUSE THE LENGTH OF TIME THAT VIDEO SITS THERE. SOMEBODY COULD DO SOME NEFARIOUS THINGS WITH IT. WE AGREE THAT THEY SHOULDN'T BE DOING IT WE DON'T AGREE THAT THAT EVERY TIME THERE IS OF OF VIDEO SYSTEM THAT THERE'S SOMEBODY TRYING TO USE IT FOR SOMETHING -- TO SHARE IT WITH SOMETHING WRONG BUT WE THINK THAT WE DO NEED TO TAKE -- AND WE HAVE A JUDICIAL COMMITTEE COMING -- HEARING COMING UP TO TAKE A MEMBERS FURTHER AMENDMENTS REDRESS THERE WERE FOUR ISSUES AT A CO YOU PUT IT ON AND WE HAVE AMENDMENTS FOR ALL FOUR OF THEM. AND IT WILL BE MEETING WITH THEM BUT I MEAN I WANT TO MAKE SURE SO THIS IS IF THIS IS A CIVIL VIOLATION BUT IF YOU COMMITTED. A IS THERE NOT A IS THERE NOT A POINTS SYSTEM WITH RESPECT TO YOUR DRIVER'S LICENSE AND THE DMV. THOUGH THIS WILL BILL IS -- IS IT SETS OF DATA BASE FIND ON LIKE A TICKET IF YOU GET PULLED OVER BY AN OFFICER IS FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS THREE POINTS IN YOUR RECORD. AT ALL ON THE AND AND THEN THE COURTS ADULTS SEVEN TO NINE HUNDRED DOLLAR -- COURT FEE SO IT'S VERY EXPENSIVE TICKET IF YOU GET CAPTURED HERE IT'S A VERY IT'S A BASE FIGHT. TO FIFTY OF FOR THE FIRST FIVE HUNDRED FOR THE SECOND NO COURT FIND NOTE NO POINTS. I MUST HAVE THE WRONG ANALYSIS. WITH I'M LOOKING I'M LOOKING AT ONE HERE LET ME JUST READ IT TO YOU. THE TOTAL FINE FOR THE FIRST VIOLATION KOONING ALSO SEATED FEES AS A MINIMUM MINIMUM OF SEVEN HUNDRED FORTY SIX DOLLARS. AND A MAXIMUM OF ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY SIX DOLLARS. IT ALSO IS A POINT TO THE DRIVER'S RECORD. AS WITH MANY TRAFFIC VIOLATIONS THE COURT MAY PERMIT A VIOLATOR TO INSTEAD PARTICIPATING TRAFFIC SCHOOL FOR A FIRST OFFENSE. AND THEN IT GOES ON TO TALK ABOUT. BUT WHOEVER WROTE THIS THAT WAS A SEVERE PENALTY SO THAT'S THE THAT'S THE GENESIS FOR MY QUESTION BECAUSE HAVING. HAVING BEEN IN CITIES WHERE YOU HAVE TRAFFIC CAMERAS AND THIS CURRENTLY THE PROCESS IS NOT MUCH DIFFERENT THAN THE PROCESS YOU'VE OUTLINED HERE. WERE A OF A PEACE OFFICER OR A PANEL OF RETIRED PEACE OFFICERS VIEW THE THE PICTURE OF THE FOOTAGE TO DETERMINE WHETHER A VIOLATION HAS OCCURRED. AND THEN DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT A CIVIL CITATION IS SENT. THE REASON I ASK. THE REASON I ASKED THE QUESTION ABOUT THE TIME LINE IS THERE THERE'S SOME TIME LINE AT LEAST UNDER THE MUNICIPAL TRAFFIC CAMERA PROGRAM. IN WHICH SOMEBODY WHO IS NOT DRIVING THE CAR HAS THE ABILITY. TO RAISE HIS OR HER HAND AND SAY IT'S NOT ME IT'S HIM. AND THEN THERE'S A SHIFTING OF RESPONSIBILITY AND PRESUMABLY A SHIFTING OF THE OF THE POINT AND IF YOU MISS IT HOWEVER YOU'RE SUNK. AND YOU ARE YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO TO COURT BUT YOU HAVE THE ISSUE OF GOING TO DRIVING SCHOOL. IN LIEU OF HAVING A POINT ASSIST AGAINST YOUR LICENSE SO AND BACK TO MY QUESTION. HOW MUCH TIME DOES YOUR? PROCESS CONTEMPLATE BECAUSE I ASSUME IF YOUR MUNICIPALITY THERE'S A PROCESS THAT YOU PUT IN PLACE IN TERMS OF HOW THIS WORKS. THIS BILL DOESN'T SEEM TO PUT THAT IN PLACE YEAH WE HAVE LIKE I SAID WE HAVE SOME MORE AMENDMENTS THAT WE HAVE TO WORK OUT OF THE TIME FRAMES. WE'RE TRYING TO TAKE THE BASS LIKE -- MONTGOMERY COUNTY MARYLAND IS THE SYSTEM THAT WERE TRYING TO MIMIC RIGHT NOW BECAUSE THEY HAVE ONE OF THE BEST SYSTEMS. THEY HAVE A SHORT SEVERAL WEEK TIMEFRAME THAT THEY DO THE REVIEW. AT THE END THEYONLY CHARGE A BASE FINE. THEY ACTUALLY FOUND THAT TO LOW BASE FIND DIDN'T GET THEM THE REDUCTION IN VIOLATIONS BUT THEN WHEN THEY WENT TO TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY BUT THEY DID FIND THAT IF THEY LEFT THE POINTS OFF THEY HAVE THE SAME SYSTEM WE HAVE A FOOT. TRAFFIC OFFICER PULLED YOU OVER IN THE IN AT THE RANDY WROTE THE ANALYSIS WAS RIGHT THAT IF YOU GET PULLED OVER THIS IS A PRETTY STE THIS IS A RIDICULOUSLY STEEP FINE. BUT THE INTENT HERE IS TO HAVE THE CITATION. TO BE  BASE FINE NO POINTS CIVIL PENALTY. FOR THE FIRST ONE TO TO EDUCATE YOU IF YOU GET HIT BY THE THIRD ONE DEAD AT ALL BETS ARE OFF WELL. LISTEN LISTEN I'M NOT COMPLAINING ABOUT THE SITE NECESSARILY ABOUT THE SIZE OF THE FILE AND WE WERE TALKING ABOUT KIDS ON SCHOOL BUSES AND PEOPLE STOPPING WHEN. THE LIGHTS ARE FLASHING IN THE SUN IS OUT. I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IF IT'S MY CAR BUT I'M NOT DRIVE AND THEN I'VE GOT TEN DAYS OR FIFTEEN DAYS WHERE THE BELLS GO OFF. AND I HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO SAY IT'S NOT MY CAR THAT'S MY CAR BUT SHE WAS DRIVING IT. IF I ONE OF FIVE ONE A YOU KNOW FINGER MY NEIGHBOR -- I DO THAT AND THEN AVOID HAVING THE PROBLEM SO THAT'S MY CONCERN I WILL STOP TALKING MISS CHAIR. THANK YOU SENATOR TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION THE BILL IS SILENT ON THAT RIGHT NOW WE'VE BEEN HAVING CONVERSATIONS ABOUT HOW. TO DEAL WITH THAT EXACT ISSUE AND AND WE EXPECT TO BE DOING AMENDMENTS ON AND I APPRECIATE YOUR OUTLINING THE NEED FOR IT [inaudible] THANK YOU. CENTER STONE AN ANSWER -- DODD THAT SURCHARGE YOU WANNA WHAT? SO I GUESS WHAT I'M WONDERING IS ARE THERE POINTS WITH THIS NOW WELL THERE IS THERE IS THE WAY IT'S WRITTEN WE ANTICIPATE DOING AMENDMENTS -- THE THAT THE ANALYSIS RAISE SOME ISSUE AS WELL AS THE OPPOSITION WERE TOTALLY PREPARED TO WORK WITH WITH EVERYBODY BUT RIGHT NOW IT'S AT ONE POINT AND IT'S A BIG FINE AND WE DON'T ANTICIPATE. GOING FORWARD THAT WE DO THAT DO IT THAT WAY WE'RE JUST BILL GO NEXT. IT'S TRIPLE REFERRED THANK YOU. THANK YOU ARE HITTING ALL THE COMMITTEES IN THE SENATE THE INTENT IS NOT YET OUT POINTS ON ON THIS THIS KIND OF A CITATION. THIS IS A TRIPLE PLAY BILL. CONSIDER STONE WERE USED TO IT EVERY CHILDREN'S SAFETY BILLS FOR OKAY GO AHEAD THANK YOU ARE STUCK IN SINCE HER FIRST BY ONE APPLY AND CENTER CABALLERO. FOR BRINGING A BILL LIKE THIS FORWARD. ONE DEATH IS TOO MUCH -- HAVING A CHILD -- WALKING ACROSS THE STREET AT AT A BUS STOP -- BUT I BUT I DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS AND I FUNDING FOR FINDING VERY HARD TO BELIEVE THAT I'M ACTUALLY AGREEING WITH THE ACLU ON AN ISSUE FOR THE FIRST TIME I THINK FIVE YEARS THAT WE'VE. BEEN HERE BUT JUST A COUPLE OF THINGS -- WHEN I WAS ON THE TO MAKE IT A CITY COUNCIL WE ARE A NEW CITY -- PEOPLE WERE GOING THROUGH RED LIGHTS BLATANTLY I MEAN IT WAS JUST RIDICULOUS Là REMEMBER. SITTING IN A CITY COUNCIL MEETING I SAID WHAT WE NEED WE NEED TO ADDRESS THIS AND I'VE. PUT TOGETHER PROGRAM CALLED THE SLAP PROGRAM STOPLIGHT ABUSE PROGRAM AND AND RIVERSIDE COUNTY AND RIPPED INTO MACULA AND AND THE FIRST THE FIRST WEEKEND I WAS DOING THAT. THEY WILL THREE HUNDRED CITATIONS [inaudible] THREE HUNDRED AND THE STOPLIGHT ABUSE WENT AWAY IMMEDIATELY SO -- INCREASE ENFORCEMENT I THINK IT'S SOMETHING IS NECESSARY AND THEN -- SOME MUNICIPALITIES IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY ORKS FOR AMENDING WITH UP WITH CAMERAS AND I'LL TELL YOU. IF THERE'S ONE THING THAT EVOKED A LOT OF ANGER WITH OUR CONSTITUENTS IT WAS A STOP LIGHT CAMERAS -- THEY CAME TO OUR COUNCIL MEETINGS AND COMPLAIN AND WHAT THEY ACTUALLY DID WAS ACTUALLY BECAUSE A LOT OF ACCIDENTS BECAUSE YOU HAVE PEOPLE THAT COULD COULD OF GONE THROUGH WITH THE SAFETY LOS AND I'M NOT TAKING ANY CHANCES. SLAMMED ON THEIR BRAKES AND REAR REAR ENDED WE HAD A LOT OF ACCIDENTS AND IT GOT TO THE POINT WHERE THEY ACTUALLY TOOK OUT ALL OF THE CAMERAS. SO THAT THAT LEADS ME TO A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE THEY WERE COMPARING THE STOP LIGHT CAMERAS WITH THE CAMP THE OTHER CAMERAS IS GOING TO BE ON THE BUS. FOR ANIMAL I KNOW I NOTICE BUT HERE'S THE DEAL AT LEAST WHEN YOU'RE GOING INTO A TRAFFIC SIGNAL KNOWS A CAMERA THERE YOU GET A FOR WARNING. THAT A RED LIGHT IS COMING UP. IN THIS BILL ARE YOU GOING TO HAVE A A YELLOW SIGN THAT SAYS A A RED STOP ORDER IS GOING TO BE COMING NEXT AND IT'S GONNA PREPARE PEOPLE DRIVING BY. TO UNDERSTAND THAT THEY BETTER STOP IF NOT THEY'RE GOING TO GET A ELEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY SIX DOLLAR. TICKET OR ARE WE GOING TO HAVE PEOPLE THAT. ARE NOT PAYING ATTENTION AS MOST PEOPLE ARE NOT AS ARE DRIVING THEIR TEXTING THERE ARE YOU MAILING THERE. LISTEN TO THE MUSIC -- SOME PEOPLE ARE GONNA DRIVE BY NOT PAY ATTENTION UP PEOPLE ARE GONNA SLAMMED THE BRAKES ON IN A SEA OF RED STOP SIGN AND YOU'RE GONNA SEE TRAFFIC COLLISIONS. AND PROBABLY MORBIDITY AND POTENTIALLY MORE MORTALITY WHICH I DON'T WANT TO SEE BUT HOW HOW WOULD HOW WOULD WE GIVE WARNINGS TOUR BUSES RIGHT NOW WHEN THEY'RE GOING TO DO STOP THEY HAVE AN AMBER LIGHT COMES ON WHEN THEY'RE ABOUT TO STOP THAT GIVES EVERYBODY BEHIND A MAN IN. FRONT OF ON A WARNING THAT THE SCHOOL BUSES ABOUT TO STOP. AND THEN -- WHEN THEY DO PULL OVER THE REDS COME ON AND THEY FOR THE FLASHING REDS ARE ON AND THEN THE STOP ARM ACTUALLY A STOP SIGN IN YOU YOU FOLKS ALL PUT THAT ON THE BUSES RIGHT TO TRY TO PROTECT THE KIDS? SO THE THIS BEST A STOP SIGN POPS OUT ON THE SIDE OF THE BUS. SO THERE IS AN AMBER SO THERE'S A WARNING TIME PERIOD. THERE IS ALSO A WARNING TIME HERE WHERE THEY ASSUME THAT LIGHT TRUCKS ARE MOVING ALONG SIDE ABBAS AND THEY GO TO PULL ROOM THEY STOP. THERE IS A LIKE SIX SECONDS BEFORE THE STOP ARM COMES OUT. THAT ALLOWS BUT EVERYBODY ELSE YOU KNOW THERE'S A AMBER. SCHOOL BUS PULLS OVER YOUR BEHIND HIM YOU KNOW IF THAT'S GOING TO STOP RED LIGHTS ARE FLASHING YOU KNOW YOUR TO YOU TO SAY THAT I KNOW I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE I USED TO BE A PARAMEDIC AND WE HAD ALL KINDS OF THINGS ARE UNITS AND I GOT. HIT THREE TIMES BY DRIVERS THAT JUST DON'T PAY ATTENTION BUT THE PROBLEM IS. THIS WORKS. IN THE STATE SET OF USERS THEY'VE THEY'VE HAD A 40% DROP IN GEORGIA. IN MARYLAND THEY'VE HAD A 50% DROP IN VIOLATIONS. THEY HAVE NOT AS MANY KIDS WE HAVE SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND KIDS RIGHT BETTER DEPENDED ON THE SAFETY THESE BUSES THESE BOSSES ARE ISLANDS THEY'RE NOT LIKE AN INTERSECTION EVERYBODY KNOWS THERE'S AN INTERSECTION HERE'S A LIGHT IT'S BEEN THERE FOREVER I DRIVE THROUGH THERE RIGHT. BUSES ARE ISLANDS THEY MOVE AROUND AND THEY'RE THE ONLY THING TO PROTECT THOSE KIDS AND UNFORTUNATELY EVERYTHING WE'VE DONE HERE IN THIS LEGISLATURE EVERYTHING WE'VE ADDED ON WE'VE GOTTEN SOME PROTECTION. THREE POINT SEVEN MILLION VIOLATIONS AND THESE ARE SPEEDING CARS THESE ARE NOT LIKE CRAWLS BY. AND SO IT'S A DIFFERENT ANIMAL I KNOW IT'S HARD TO KIND OF LIKE YOU GET AWAY FROM OKAY RED LIGHT. RED LIGHT. INTERSECTION HAS THESE. BIG PROBLEMS. THIS IS A SCHOOL BUS SITUATION THESE CAMERAS ARE EVEN DIFFERENT THE PIXEL RATE ON A MORE DIFFERENT. THEY'RE A DIFFERENT TYPE OF TECHNOLOGY. AND FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS IN THAT JURISDICTION'S THERE'S BILLBOARDS TO HAVE TO BE PUT UP THEIR SPECIAL SIGNAGE ON THE BACK OF THE BUS IS THAT YOU HAVE TO ADD. THERE'S A WHOLE LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS THIS IS A DIFFERENT ANIMAL THAN AN INTERSECTION OKAY AND CAN YOU ELABORATE I KNOW THERE ARE SPECIAL INSTANCES -- ON A SCHOOL BUS WHEN THE SCHOOL BUS DRIVER ACTUALLY NEEDS TO GET OUT AN ESCORT THE STUDENTS ACROSS ACROSS WALKER WHERE CAN YOU ELABORATE ON THAT. NOW I KNOW IN ALL THE FOLLOWING THAT GOT THAT RULE THERE'S A LOT THERE'S A THERE'S A A LAW IS A GOOD LAW IT SAYS THAT THE SCHOOL BUS DRIVERS. MUST GET OFF AND AND AND I ESCORT. CHILDREN WHERE THEY THINK THAT IT'S THERE THAT'S NECESSARY TO DO THAT. THE PRODUCT BUT IT DOES NOT REQUIRE THEM TO DO IT. THE PROBLEM IS IS THAT IS SPECIAL IN RURAL AREAS LIKE YOU KNOW CENTER MCGUIRE IS GONE NOW BUT AND CENTER REQUIRES ORIENT AND FALL OUT YOUR RIVERSIDE AREA. IT'S A LONG BUS RIDE FOR THOSE KIDS. IF THE IF THE DRIVER GOT OFF EVERY TIME. IT WOULDN'T BE AN HOUR RIDE IT WOULD BE A TWO ARE RIGHT IT IS JUST NOT PRACTICAL BUT THE LAWS THERE. AND THEY CAN AND THEY SHOULD AND THEY DO GET OFF TO PROTECT THOSE KIDS UNFORTUNATELY ONE OF THE THINGS WE FOUND IN THE UC BERKELEY ANALYSIS OF THE DATA. WE SUSPECT THAT A COUPLE THE INDIVIDUALS THAT WERE HIT AROUND THOSE BOSSES WERE THE DRIVERS. AND WE'RE STILL TRYING TO WE CAN'T READ THE REST OF THE REPORT WE CAN ONLY READ THAT THERE IS A HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE PEOPLE YET. GOING TO OR FROM THE SCHOOL BUS SO. YEAH BUT YOU'RE RIGHT IN THE ONE WHICH IS FINAL QUESTION -- YES SIR WHO IS GOING TO BE THE BENEFICIARY OF THE THE REVENUES GENERATED BY THE THE TICKETING IF YOU WILL. WHAT I WAS GONNA BE REVENUE SHARING OF THAT THE TICKETS? THE BILL OF THE REVENUE IT'S IT'S THE SAME AS YOUR WE DON'T CHANGE THE CURRENT SHARING A LOT EXCEPT FOR THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS ALLOWED. TO NEGOTIATE WITH THE THE THE CITY AND COUNTY JURISDICTIONS TO USE SOME OF THE FINEST ARRIVE TO PAY FOR THE SYSTEM. AND THEY CAN ONLY DO THAT THEY CAN'T INCENTIVIZE FOR YOU KNOW YOU GET A WHOLE BUNCH MORE TICKETS THEY CAN'T DO THAT IN THE CONTRACTS. BUT THE IT'S PAID -- FOR BECAUSE SCHOOLS WERE NOT. HANDING THE SCHOOLS EXTRA MONEY THE SCHOOLS PAY FOR THIS AND ALL THE OTHER STATES USE THAT THEY PAY FOR IT OUT OF THE OF FINES BUT IS NEGOTIATED WITH THE ENTITIES HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE DON'T CHANGE THE THE HOW IT'S STRUCTURED NOW. THE CITIES AND COUNTIES IN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THEY HAVE THE SAFETY PROGRAMS ALL GET THEIR THEIR SHARE EXCEPT FOR THEY CAN TAKE SOME OF THE MONEY TO PAY FOR THE SYSTEM. IS THERE ANYTHING IN YOUR BILL SENATOR THAT -- HE IS A A A VOLUME INCENTIVE FOR THE MORE CITATIONS ARE ISSUED THE MORE REVENUE THAT IS COLLECTED OR JUST A FLAT FEE FOR THE LEASE OF THE CAMERAS AND WHATEVER REVENUES THAT'S ONE OF OUR MEMBERS. PROPOSING THAT OKAY. IN THAT REVENUE IS ONLY TO RECOVER THE COSTS OF THE SYSTEM. THE PROBLEM IS IN THE MUNICIPALITIES THANK YOU MISTER. OF CENTER BROUGHT UP THE AMENDMENTS THE AMENDMENTS -- ARE ACCEPTED BY THE OFFICERS CENTER -- SAID. BUT THEY WILL BE X. PUT INTO PLAY IN THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. NOT NOT TODAY OKAY SO WILL THE AMENDMENTS ARE ACCEPTED ONLY PUT IN. TO PLAY IN THE NEXT COMMITTEE OKAY -- SIR SIR YOU HAVE ANY -- ADDITIONAL COMMENTS NO I REALLY THANK YOU FOR THE ROBUST DISCUSSION THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT ISSUE AND I APPRECIATE. THE CONVERSATION AND I WERE TAKING IT INTO ACCOUNT AND YOU'LL SEE A MEN'S COME FORWARD IN THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. OF CENTER -- WHEN I WAS IN SEVENTH GRADE -- A HEARD A CRASH AND IT WAS A BLOCK AWAY FROM MY HOME AND SO A A WALK DOWN. TO THE NEARBY CORNER AND THERE WAS SOME. A SCHOOL BUS. AND WHAT HAPPEN IS A SCHOOL BUS STOPPED. AND A BUNCH OF STUDENTS GOT OFF THE BUS [inaudible] AND ON OUR SIDE OF THE STREET TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STREET FROM THE SCHOOL BUS SO LITTLE BOY WAS IN THIRD GRADE. RAN ACROSS THE STREET TO GREET HIS SISTER WHO IS I THINK IN THE EIGHTH GRADE OR NINTH GRADE. AND A CAR RAN RAN THROUGH THE RED -- THE STOP SIGN AND KILLED THE BOY. SO EVER SINCE THEN IT'S BEEN ON MY MIND. AND THAT'S KIND OF DRIVEN ME ON THIS. TRAFFIC SAFETY ISSUE IT'S ALWAYS IN MY MIND. SO I WE'RE GOING TO DO THE AMENDMENTS FOR THIS AND ARJUNA VOTE. WE HAVE A MOTION CENTER OKAY THANK YOU -- CALL THE ROLL PLEASE. WITH THE SENATE BILL.

MODEL AFTER STATUTES FOR ALCOHOL BUSES IN LIMOS SB SIX TWENTY FIVE WILL PROHIBIT. CANNABIS USE IN THESE VEHICLES UNLESS SAFETY STANDARDS ARE FOLLOWED. SPECIFICALLY SB SIX TWENTY FIVE MAKES IT ILLEGAL FOR A PASSENGER ANY PARTY BUS OR LIMO TO SMOKE OR VAPOR CANNABIS. UNLESS THE DRIVER'S COMPARTMENT IS SEALED OFF AND SEPARATELY VENTILATED. THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL IS TO ENSURE THAT THE DRIVER IS NOT IMPAIRED IF CANNABIS SMOKE IS CONSUMED IN ONE OF THESE FOR HIGHER VEHICLES THE BILL ALSO PROHIBITS ANYONE. UNDER TWENTY ONE FROM BEING ON BOARD IF CANNABIS SMOKE IS PRESENT. SB SIX TWENTY FIVE WILL ESTABLISH SAFETY RULES TO PROTECT CONSUMERS AND ELIMINATE BAD ACTORS.

THANK YOU -- AND I DO APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING THIS FORWARD I KNOW IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT STEP AND MAKING SURE THAT OUR OUR YOUTH IS SAFE I'M JUST I HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF A QUESTION IN TERMS OF FIVE ENFORCEMENT AND I'M SORRY I WALKED IN A LITTLE LATE. CAN YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW THE ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT. WHAT IS THAT ARE LESS THAN TWENTY YEARS A TWENTY ONE YEARS OLD ARE NOT IN THE CAR WELL IT'S SIMILAR TO CURRENTLY THE HIGHWAY PATROL AND FORCES THE THE DRIVING REGULATIONS AND THEY ALSO ENFORCE THE INSPECTION OF BUSES AND -- AND THOSE WHERE THIS WOULD BE ALLOWED TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE COMPARTMENTS ARE IN FACT IN THERE ARE VEHICLES IN IN COLORADO WHERE THEY USE IT TODAY WHEN THEY HAVE THOSE BUS TOURS OF OF DEATH CANNABIS IT TOWARDS RECREATIONALLY AND THE THE CAB -- THE DRIVER'S COMPARTMENT IS COMPLETELY SEALED OFF TO THOSE BUSES ARE AVAILABLE NAY WOULD BE INSPECTED BY -- THE HIGHWAY PATROL JUST AS BUSES ARE TODAY THE ISSUE OF OF ANYONE TWENTY ONE OR OLDER IN A BUS IS A SIMILAR TO THE LEGISLATION I'VE HAD BEFORE. RELATED TO PARTY BUSES AND ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION ON THOSE BUSES IN THE SAME REGULATIONS WOULD APPLY TO THE USE HERE AS THEY DO TODAY SO IT'S A MEET THE THE HIGHWAY PATROL WOULD HAVE THE ABILITY TO STOP THOSE LOCAL POLICE WOULD HAVE ABILITY TO STOP THOSE AND AND IN FOR SHOULD. JUST SERVO CENTER AND WILL KEEP THE ROLE FROM FRANCE AND MEMBERS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU COLLEAGUES -- STONE WOULD YOU LIKE TO PRESENT YOUR BILL PLEASE. OKAY SIR STONE AS A FLOOR. AND HE WILL PRESENT SB. THREE FORTY HIGH SPEED RAIL. THANK YOU HONORABLE CHAIR BILL PART OF THE BUSINESS DAY. THE REASON [inaudible] LOW RIDERSHIP. THE SHOULD NOT COME AS A SURPRISE US IN THE FRESNO BEE IN NOVEMBER OF LAST YEAR REPORTED THAT AMTRAK RIDERSHIP IS DECREASED EACH OF THE LAST FIVE YEARS. OUR STATE AUDITOR'S ALSO RELEASED A REPORT. IT HIGHLIGHTED THAT THE PROJECTED COSTS FOR THE HIGH SPEED RAIL. BUT THE ESTIMATES NOW REACHING OVER SEVENTY SEVEN POINT. THREE BILLION DOLLARS. SADLY THE HIGH SPEED RAIL PROJECT ONLY HAS TWELVE POINT SIX BILLION SECURED IN FINDING. WHICH IS A MIXTURE FOR PROOF STATE FUNDS AND FEDERAL FUNDS. THIS MEANS THAT LESS THAN ONE SIXTH OF THE FUNDS NEEDED TO COMPLETE THE PROJECT ARE AVAILABLE. HARD WORKING CALIFORNIANS ARE ON THE HOOK FOR ALMOST SIXTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS TO HAVE A TRAINED THAT. THEY CLEARLY DON'T WANT TO USE. AS A RESULT OF THIS MASSIVE INCREASE IN COST TO THE TAXPAYERS PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR THE HIGH SPEED RAIL PROJECT HAS SHARPLY DECLINED. A U. S. C. LA TIMES POLL EARLY THIS YEAR SHOWED THAT 49% OF CALIFORNIANS WANT TO KILL ALL FUNDING FOR THE PROJECT. WASTING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON A PROJECT THAT HAS BEEN SO HORRIBLY MISMANAGED IS NOW MORE IMPORTANT THAN IT EVER HAS BEEN. EVEN OUR GOVERNOR'S GOVERNOR GAS AT GAVIN NEWSOM AND HIS STATE OF THE STATE ADMITTED QUOTE. THE PROJECT IS CURRENTLY PLAN WOULD COST TOO MUCH. AND TAKE TOO LONG. THERE'S BEEN TOO LITTLE OVERSIGHT. AND NOT ENOUGH TRANSPARENCY END QUOTE [inaudible] RIGHT NOW. THERE SIMPLY ISN'T A PATH TO GET FROM SACRAMENTO TO SAN DIEGO LET ALONE SAN FRANCISCO TO LA. I WISH THERE WERE. COLLEAGUES I AGREE WITH THE GOVERNOR. SB THREE FORTY WHAT IN THE FAILED HIGH SPEED RAIL PROJECT BY STATING THAT. NO FURTHER BONDS SHALL BE SOLD FOR HIGH SPEED RAIL PURPOSES PURSUANT TO PROP ONE A EXCEPT. S. SPECIFICALLY PROVIDED WITH RESPECT TO AN EXISTING APPROPRIATION FOR HIGH SPEED RAIL PURPOSES FOR EARLY IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS IN THE PHASE. ONE BLENDED SYSTEM. I'M SPENT PROCEEDS RECEIVE FROM THE OUTSTANDING OUTSTANDING BOND ISSUED WILL BE USED TO SETTLE WITH THAT. ANCHORED FROM THE ISSUANCE OF SAID BONDS. SB THREE FORTY RECOGNIZES THE TAXPAYERS FUN MUCH NEEDED PUBLIC. PROJECTS AROUND THE STATE. BUT THAT A HIGH SPEED RAIL IS NOT NECESSARY NOT POSSIBLE WITHIN THE SCOPE OF REASONABLE ACCOUNTABILITY. TO THE TAXPAYERS. COLLEAGUES LET'S CUT OUR OFFICES IT MEANT THAT THIS IS A PROJECT THAT NO ONE WANTS OR NEEDS. AND MOVE ON TO MORE IMPORTANT TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO OUR FORTY MILLION CONSTITUENTS. FOR THOSE REASONS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. THERE WERE NO. OUR SPEAKERS IN FAVOR PLEASE COME FORWARD. NONE FIGURES OPPOSE PLEASE COME FORWARD. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN KEITH DONE HERE ON BEHALF OF THE ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA HIGH SPEED TRAINS -- I AM THANKFUL FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO COMMENT ON THIS PROPOSAL -- IT WAS MENTIONED THAT THE MAJORITY CALIFORNIANS BY THE CENTER DON'T SUPPORT BUT I'D LIKE TO OPEN TO ALSO REFERENCE A POLL THAT WAS ABOUT A YEAR AGO BY THE PP I SEE WHICH SAY THAT 53% OF CALIFORNIANS STILL DO SUPPORT HIGH SPEED RAIL AND THAT WAS. ONE OF THE MORE RECENT POLLS THAT WERE TAKEN LUIS REMEMBER THE POLLS ARE REALLY A SNAPSHOT IN TIME THEY GIVE YOU THE PERCEPTION OF WHAT SOME OF OUR VOTERS THINK AT THAT VERY MOMENT. WE HAVE HAD AN ELECTION -- IN WHICH THE VOTERS WERE ASKED WHETHER OR NOT THEY SUPPORTED ICE REAL NAY RESOUND LEAST DO AND DID ENDORSE -- THAT PROJECT CAN CONTINUE TO DO SO TODAY -- HIGH SPEED RAIL YOU KNOW I REPRESENT A LOT OF DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS THAT SUPPORT TRANSFORMATIVE PROJECTS FOR TRANSPORTATION TO OUR STATE HIGH SPEED RAIL HAPPENS TO BE ONE OF THEM. IT'S PART OF A SYSTEM THAT IS GOING TO INNOVATE ARE -- ABILITY TO MOVE OUR CITIZENS FROM. THE WORK CENTERS TO THE HOUSING CENTERS TO CONNECT THE CENTRAL VALLEY TO THE SILICON VALLEY AND REMAINS A PRIORITY NOT ONLY OF THIS GOVERNOR WHO HAS SAID SINCE HIS SAY THE STATE TO CLARIFY HIS COMMITMENT TO HIGH SPEED RAIL WE STAND WITH THE GOVERNOR. AND HIS COMMITMENT TO CONNECT THE VALLEYS AND TO INVEST IN THE BOOK AND WE HAVE OLYMPICS COMING THE LOS ANGELES WE'VE GOT GREAT THINGS GOING ON THE CITY OF SAN JOSE WERE THE CHAIRMAN'S FROM. THAT HIGH SPEED REELS GOING TO CONTINUE TO TRANSFORM THOSE COMMUNITIES TO BRING WORKERS TO THE JOB CENTERS FROM HOUSING THAT'S MORE AFFORDABLE AND SOME OF YOUR DISTRICTS. THIS REMAINS A PRIORITY PROJECT NOT ONLY FOR CALIFORNIANS BUT ALSO FROM A POLICY PERSPECTIVE FROM THIS BODY AND YOUR COLLEAGUES ACROSS IN THE ASSEMBLY SO. FOR THOSE REASONS AND MANY MORE WE WOULD ASK THAT YOU VOTE NO ON THIS PROPOSAL WE APPRECIATE YOUR TIME THANK YOU. YOUR OTHER SPEAKERS OPPOSING PLEASE [inaudible] OKAY -- QUESTIONS WERE COMMITTEE OF CHECK OUT JOHNNY -- FIRST OF ALL I WOULD LIKE TO SAY I THINK THAT YOU IN THE GOVERNOR ACTUALLY MILES APART ON THIS ON THIS PROJECT THE GOVERNOR DOES SUPPORT THIS. AND WHAT HE SAID AS HE WANTS TO FINISH UP TO MERCED AND DOWN TO BAKERSFIELD SO THAT WE HAVE AND AN INCH AND NATIONAL OPERATING SEGMENT. THE TEST TRACK SO THAT WE CAN CONNECT WITH REGIONAL RAIL THAT IS WHAT HE IS FOR AND HE'S NOT TRYING TO GET RID OF THE PROJECT -- SECONDLY I JUST WANT TO BRING UP SOMETHING THAT WE NEVER TALK ABOUT AND THAT'S THE FACT THAT. DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY DEATHS THAT HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH HIGH SPEED RAIL THROUGHOUT THE WORLD AND SINCE NINETEEN FIFTY NINE NINETEEN SIXTY FOUR WHEN IT WAS FIRST INSTITUTED. IN JAPAN. THERE WAS ONE ACCIDENT THAT RESULTED IN SOME DEATHS IN CHINA A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO THAT'S ALL WE HAVE DEBTS ON OUR CALIFORNIA HIGHWAYS EVERY TIME WE TURN AROUND. AND THERE'S NO THERE'S NO MONETARY AMOUNT THAT CAN ACCOUNT FOR THE SAFETY MEASURES THAT WE FAIL TO TALK ABOUT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THIS PROJECT SO I JUST THINK THAT. IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S IMPORTANT TO ALSO RECOGNIZED WHY THIS IMPORTANT WHY THIS PROJECT IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT. TO FORWARD CENTER GALGIANI AYE. AYE A PER AYE PRESHEAF THOSE COMMENTS AND I THINK SAFETY IS A VERY IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION. AND AND I KNOW YOU WERE INSTRUMENTAL IN HELPING. GET THIS ON THE BALLOT AND AND I APPLAUD YOU FOR YOUR EFFORTS I THINK IF IF PEOPLE -- WE'RE JUST ASK THE QUESTION HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO GET ON A HIGH SPEED TRAIN FROM LOS ANGELES SAN FRANCISCO GET THERE IN TWO AND A HALF HOURS AND PAY A SEVENTY NINE DOLLAR. FEE TO DO THAT. I CAN TELL YOU SOMETHING I WOULD DRIVE LOS ANGLES AND DO IT I MEAN. BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT UNFORTUNATELY -- PROJECT THIS IS NOT EVEN STATE ARE YOU TALK ABOUT TRAINS IN JAPAN. OR YOU TALK ABOUT -- THE MAGLEV THAT EXISTS IN CHINA GETTING FROM THE AIRPORT I MEAN THERE ARE TECHNOLOGIES OUT THERE THAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THE STATE HAS AN EMBRACE THESE HIGH SPEED TRAINS AGO THREE HUNDRED MILES AN HOUR. AND YOU HAVE FLAT AREA IN THE IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY WHERE THEY PROBABLY COULD DO THREE HUNDRED MILES AN HOUR PROBABLY GETTING OVER SOME HILLS AND GETTING THROUGH TUNNELS MIGHT BE A CHALLENGE BUT AND IN JAPAN I'VE BEEN ON THOSE TRAINS. AND THEY HAD AND THEY DO GO OVER HILLS AND THEY DO GO THROUGH TUNNELS AND THE USE OF TECHNOLOGY THAT IS NOT YOUR TYPICAL STEEL ON STEEL TECHNOLOGIES SO. IT JUST SEEMS LIKE THIS THIS PROJECT ONE TO GOT OUT OF THE GATE -- I DON'T KNOW -- IF WHICH HAD BEEN MISMANAGED I DON'T KNOW IF THE IF THE THE VISION OF WHAT WE DEFINE AS HIGH SPEED RAIL WAS. WAS ADULTERATED SOMEWHERE ALONG THE LINE -- I JUST KNOW THE CALIFORNIA IS THE INNOVATOR AND I I CAN I THINK THAT PEOPLE IN IN CONCEPT WOULD LOVE TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO GET ON TRAINS. LIKE YOU CAN IN EUROPE LIKE YOU CAN IN JAPAN BUT WE ARE A LONG SINCE STATE WE HAVE A LOT OF SPRAWL ESPECIALLY IN. EASTERN COACHELLA VALLEY I MEAN A LOT TO GET ON THE TRAIN. IN -- IN LOOKING TO WHERE I LIVE IN. I'D LIKE TO JUST BE ABLE TO TAKE THE TRAIN TO ONTARIO PORT THAT WOULD SAVE ME A LOT OF TIME. BUT THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT THE SAFETY ATTRIBUTES OF OF TRAINS BY. AYE AYE SUPPORT THAT THAT THAT IDEA AND I JUST HOPE THAT WE CAN RE LOOK AT THIS TRAIN MAYBE WE TAKE A PAUSE AND SAY LISTEN IT'S NINETY EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS IS WHAT I'M EVEN HEARING THAT THIS THING IS GOING TO BE WHEN IT'S ULTIMATELY COMPLETED IF YOU LOOK. AT THE ACTUAL REAL COST OF A GOING FROM LA TO SAN FRANCISCO THE ACTUAL COST MIGHT BE FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS WHEN YOU CAN STILL GET ON A JET. FROM -- SOUTHWEST AT A BURBANK FOR SIXTY NINE DOLLARS AND SO WITH THE PUBLIC SUBSIDY OF THIS ONCE IT'S DONE IS ALSO GOING TO BE SOMETHING THAT REALLY NEEDS TO BE INVESTIGATED. SO MAYBE LOOK AT THIS IS JUST A PAUSE UP WE CAN JUST TAKE A STEP BACK AND REALLY IDENTIFY WITH THIS THING WITH WHAT IS THING REALLY GOING TO COST AND IS A REALLY MORE INNOVATIVE WAYS. TO TO MOVE PEOPLE WITH -- MORE MODERN VERSIONS OF WHAT WE DEFINE AS HIGH SPEED RAIL BUT I APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS THANK YOU CENTERS ON QUESTIONS FROM ANYBODY ON THE COMMITTEE CENTER BATES. THANK YOU. FINISH AVAIL ENOUGH THANK YOU SENATOR STONE FOR BRING IT FORWARD I DO THINK THAT. THE DIALOGUE ON THIS ISSUE WITH HIGH SPEED RAIL MUST CONTINUE. ON MAYBE WE WILL GET THAT NO STATE OF THE ART SYSTEM AT SOME POINT IN TIME. BY ITS FULL IT MUCH IN THE DISTANT FUTURE IN THE SUBSIDY ISSUES HUGE. BY HAVING THROUGH JOHN NOW ON ORANGE COUNTY'S TOLL ROADS FOR MANY YEARS AND JOB THE USER FEES ARE WHICH WERE THE TOLLS COLLECTED. I TOOK A LONG TIME TO CATCH UP WITH ALL THE MONTEREY BEEN ISSUE THE REVENUE BONDS IN FACT REFINANCING WAS REQUIRED. IT'S NOT EVEN POSSIBLE WITH THIS PROJECT SECONDLY IT'S BEEN MY CONCERN. THAT SB ONE IS ONLY TEN YEARS AND DOG FIFTY BILLION DOLLARS IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. FOR TEN THAT AFTER THAT THERE'S NO REQUIREMENT THAT MONEY BE SPENT ON OUR WHAT SB ONE LAID OUT AND MY CONCERN IS THAT THAT WOULD BECOME THE REVENUE STREAM. SO THESE ARE CONVERSATIONS THAT WE NEED TO HAVE BECAUSE IT'S SO IMPORTANT AND TRANSPORTATION. THAT PROMISES MADE TO THE PUBLIC ARE PROMISES KEPT. AND THAT'S WHAT'S FAILING ON MANY FRONTS WE'VE SEEN OUR RADIO TAX ON SB ONE WE'RE GONNA HOLD LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HOSTAGE. UNFORTUNATELY THOSE I'VE BEEN PUT ASIDE. BUT THE IDEA IS STILL THERE. AND I THINK THESE ARE THINGS THAT REALLY START TROUBLING ARE THE PUBLIC OUT THERE WHO IS CRYING. FOR A BETTER MOBILITY. A WE KNOW THAT CONGESTION IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS WITH THOUGHT. TALKS OF FLYING THE AIR YOU KNOW SO THANK YOU FOR CONTINUING TO RAISE THE ISSUE. I WILL BE SUPPORTING IT TODAY. I ACTUALLY SUPPORTED THE BOND MEASURE WAY BACK WHEN BECAUSE I THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO GET SOMETHING THAT SOUNDED GREAT. HAND JOB PERHAPS THE BUSINESS PLAN SHOULD HAVE BEEN. MORE CLOSELY ANALYZED WAY BACK WHEN IT WASN'T -- FORTUNATELY THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF ATTENTION NOW TO THE THE FAILURES THAT SEEM TO HAVE THE ON BEEN. HAPPENING BECAUSE FOR LACK OF MORE ON CRITICAL THINKING AND IT ABILITY TO KIND OF TAKE A STEP BACK POLICY IF YOU WILL. LOOK FOR A BETTER BETTER ROUTE NO NO PUN INTENDED I I'VE HEARD FROM PEOPLE WHO. ARE THIS IS WAY BACK WHEN I WAS ON ORANGE COUNTY TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY VERY FAMILIAR WITH RAIL SERVICE IN THE EAST. AND THE FACT THAT IF WE DONE GRADE SEPARATIONS ON THE EXISTING RAIL. AND THOSE ARE VERY EXPENSIVE THAT PUT A LOT OF MONEY AND THAT WE COULD PROBABLY HAVE ON THE EXISTING RAIL CONNECTING AT THROUGH THE VALLEY THERE. IN SOMETHING THAT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN AS IMPACTFUL TO THE VALLEY FAMILIES THAT WE WOULD MAYBE HAVE SOMETHING CLOSER TO REALITY RIGHT NOW. A SALUTING SET SEEM TO CONTINUALLY BE MISTER PEOPLE NOT WILLING TO CONFRONT THAT. ALSO THANK YOU AND YOU KEEP PUTTING IT OUT THERE ON THE MENU AND WE CAN CONTINUE TO LOOK AT THAT AND PERHAPS A CHANGE THE DIRECTION. THAT BENEFITS SAW ALL OF US WHO SUPPORTED CONCEPTUALLY BUT ARE VERY -- I THINK DISAPPOINTED -- DISSOLUTION THAT CAN IT CAN IT EVER BE A REALITY. CLICK HERE. THANK YOU OF CENTER BATES -- SIR STONE YOU HAVE A CLOSING STATEMENT. YES -- MISTER CHAIRMAN -- I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT THIS BILL I KNOW THIS IS A VERY BOLD BILL -- I I KNOW WE'VE WE'VE GONE DOWN A VERY EXPENSIVE PATH AND I THINK WE ALL WANT. A HIGH SPEED RAIL SYSTEM THAT IS COST EFFECTIVE IN STATE OF THE ART. AND SO MY BILL IS BASICALLY A PAUSE IT'S BASICALLY SAYING WE'RE GONNA STOP THE FUNDING -- WHETHER IT'S TEMPORARY. OR WHETHER IT'S PERMANENT. UNTIL WE CAN GATHER THE THE BEST PROFESSIONALS THAT WE IF WE HAVE WE'VE DONE SO FAR AND WHAT WE CAN DO IN THE FUTURE TO REALLY HAVE. A STATE OF THE ART TRAIN HIGH SPEED TRAIN THAT PEOPLE WILL UTILIZE. WHERE DO YOU LIVE IN THE COACHELLA VALLEY WHETHER YOU LIVE IN INYO COUNTY WHERE DO YOU LIVE IN SAN FRANCISCO COUNTY -- BELIEVE ME I WON ALTERNATIVE FORMS OF TRANSPORTATION THAN CARS. AND AIRPLANES -- I I CAN'T TELL YOU SENATOR HOW MANY HOURS I SPENT IN AIRPORTS AND HOW MANY HOURS I SPENT ON PLANES. THAT I WOULD RATHER SIT ON A TRAIN. AND READ MY PACKETS -- AND ENJOY THE RIDE AND AND ENJOY THE BEAUTIFUL SCENERY AND OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA STATE OF FLYING OVER IT ALL THE TIME -- IT NOT TO MENTION YOU KNOW HE LONG MUSK IN HIS -- HYPERLOOP YOU KNOW THERE'S EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES OUT THERE THAT MIGHT BE CHEAPER AND MIGHT BE BETTER. SO UP WITH THAT THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THE TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE SENATOR IT'S AN HONOR TO SERVE WITH YOU. AND SHOULD I BOOK THANK YOU OF CENTER OF I HAVE A LOT TO SAY ABOUT THIS BUT I'LL JUST SAY THAT YOU YOU MADE SOME STATEMENTS I AGREE WITH. I A I THINK WE NEED TO BE MORE PRODUCTIVE IN TERMS OF HOW WE APPROACH SIZE BE REAL. HOWEVER I'D LIKE TO SEE IT FINISHED QUICKER -- I THINK THE FASTER YOU FINISH A PROJECT THE ROADLESS ACOSTA NOTE. I KNOW THAT FROM EXPERIENCE -- CAN SPEED UP THE PROJECT SOMEWHERE -- WITH SOME CREATIVE FINANCING OR SOME OTHER WAY WE CAN -- REALLY SAVE THE TAXPAYERS MONEY. THE SP ONE FUNDS -- MENTIONED OR ESTABLISHED IN THE STATUTE IT'S NOT A TIME LIMITED STATUTE IS A PERMANENT STATUTES OF THOSE MONIES ARE ALLOCATED TO THE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW. AND NOW PROPOSITION -- SIXTY NINE AN ARTICLE NINETEEN OF THE CONSTITUTION SO. WE HAVE -- THE STRUCTURE ON THOSE OF THOSE FUNDS IN THAT WAY -- I WANTED TO MAKE SURE EVERYBODY KNEW THAT. BUT UNFORTUNATELY CERRO HAVE TO RECOMMEND -- OPPOSE ON THIS -- MEASURE AND ALTHOUGH I HOPE YOU CONTINUE TO ADVOCATE. FOR YOU KNOW THE ISSUES THAT YOU CARE ABOUT. I WILL RECOMMEND OPPOSE THIS OF THIS PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION SO YOU'RE WELCOME -- A MOVE THE BILL CENTER BATES HAS A MOTION ON THE FLOOR TO MOVE THE BILL. AND WILL CALL THE ROLL THANK YOU. SENATE BILL THREE FORTY BY SENATOR STONE THE MOTION IS TO PASS AND REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON GOVERNANCE AND FINANCE. THEIR ABOUT NO BELT NO BATES HI BATES I DON GALGIANI. GALGIANI NO MCGUIRE REQUIRE NO MORALE. ROSS RUBIO. RUBIO NO SKINNER STONE I DON'T AYE AMBERG CASKEY. UP TO VOTE IN FAVOR WILL LEAVE THE ROLE FOR A SEPTEMBER'S. CENTER BATES ALTERNATE GAL. ONE I THINK MY BILLS OF THE LAST ONES. YES. THERE'S NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT THERE TM. INTO SUPPORTER OF A LET. TWO ONE THREE TWO THE SALON REAL TOUGH. MAY HAVE THE MISSION OKAY -- CENTER. SENATOR BAIL. THANK YOU WE ARE READY FOR YOU OKAY [inaudible] WELL -- CENTER BATES -- MADAM CHAIR ALL PRESENT TO IF YOU IF IT'S A PLEASURE -- I'LL START WITH THE SP ONE FIFTY TWO YES OKAY -- I WILL BEGIN WITH THAT ONE THEN THANK YOU -- I AM PROUD TO PRESENT SB -- ONE FIFTY TWO THIS IS A BILL THAT I BELIEVE WILL IMPROVE THE ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM BY MAKING A MINISTRY OF IMPROVEMENTS. INCREASING THE REGIONAL. REGIONAL ORGANIZATIONS ROLE. NOW SPECIFICALLY THIS BILL WOULD EXPEDITE BICYCLE AND PEDESTRIAN IMPROVEMENTS BY SHIFTING MORE MINISTER RESPONSIBLE TO THE METROPOLITAN -- TRIP PLANNING ORGANIZATIONS -- IN OTHER WORDS CLOSE WATER CLOSER TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT -- ADDITIONALLY IT MODIFIES THE SURE FUNDS DISTRIBUTED BY FORMULA PROVIDING A MORE PREDICTABLE FUNDING -- ACROSS THE DIFFERENT REASONS REGIONS OF THE STATE -- THE CHANGES IS INCLUDED. INCREASING THE REGIONAL SHARE FROM 4275%. INCREASE IN THE WORLD SMALLER IS FROM 10215%. AND REDUCING THE STATE SHARES FROM 5210%. I APPRECIATE THE FEEDBACK RECEIVED ON THE BILL AND FEEL THAT WE'VE HAD MANY PRODUCTIVE. MEETINGS WITH THE VARIOUS THAT SHOULD STAKEHOLDERS -- ON COMMITTED TO ENCOURAGING WE MAINTAIN GOALS OF THE ATP PROGRAM. PARTICULARLY FOR DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. CONTINUE TO HOLD MEETINGS AND COMMITTED TO AMEND THE BILL TO CLARIFY THE IMPLEMENTATION TIMELINE -- CONTINUE TO GUARANTEE DELEGATION TO DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES CLARIFY. THE OVERSIGHT ON THE MPO APPLICATION -- IN -- GUIDELINES ON AND ON PROJECT COMPLETION. AND TODAY AS THEY HAVE WITNESSES ABOUT INSURER AND ALTERNATIVE FOR MY WITNESSES -- THIS BILL IS A WORK IN PROGRESS. SO I'LL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE GROUPS -- WE ARE GETTING CLOSE TO AGREEMENT BUT WILLS WILL CONTINUE TO WORK SAW TURN OVER TO MY WITNESSES MANAGER. WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS FOR BACK ALONG WITH THE METROPOLITAN TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION. MTC IS SPONSORING SB ONE FIFTY TWO BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THE STATE'S ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM CAN BE DELIVERED MORE EFFECTIVELY AND MORE EFFICIENTLY BY DELEGATING A MUCH LARGER SHARE TO THE REGIONAL LEVEL. AND REMOVING THE REQUIREMENT THAT EVERY REGIONALLY APPROVED PROJECT -- TODAY BE APPROVED AND SEES ME ALLOCATED BY THE CTC A STEP THAT ADDS TWO MONTHS OF UNNECESSARY DELAY TO EVERY PROJECT. YOU'VE HEARD A LOT TODAY ABOUT THE CHALLENGES THAT AND HERE'S FACED REACHING THEIR GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION TARGETS AND EIGHTY P. PROGRAM IS VERY WELL SUITED PROGRAM TO ASSIST WITH THAT -- WE WOULD JUST EMPHASIZE THAT THE STATE'S MODEL FOR FUNDING TRANSPORTATION AND FOR DRESSING THE TRANSPORTATION -- IMPACTS OF ARTS USING THE GREENHOUSE GAS IMPACTS ASSOCIATE WITH TRANSPORTATION IS VERY MUCH A BOTTOM UP MODEL. AND SO WE THINK THAT THE ATP SHOULD REALLY FOLLOW THAT -- THE SIMILAR TO WHAT WE DO WITH THE STEP THE STATE TRANSPORTATION IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM. AND AGAIN SINCE -- GETTING MORE PEOPLE TO BUY CAN WALK TO ON THEIR DESTINATIONS TO BUY CAN WALK TO TRANSIT IS SO ESSENTIAL AS PART OF OUR GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION TARGETS WE THINK THAT FOLLOWING THAT. THAT 75% BOTTOM UP APPROACH MAKES SENSE -- WE'VE HEARD A LOT FROM SOME OF THE THE FOLKS WHO ARE IN OPPOSITION WERE VERY INTERESTED IN WORKING WITH THEM WE THINK THAT. I'M A LOT OF THEIR CONCERNS CAN BE ADDRESSED AS THE SENATOR STATED -- I WOULD JUST LIKE TO TAKE A MOMENT TO MENTION A COUPLE OF ISSUES ON THE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES PIECE OUR INTENT WAS NEVER TO NOT -- ENSURE THAT THE REGIONAL PROGRAM ON REACH THOSE TARGETS AS WELL IN FACT ON TODAY THE OVER FOUR CYCLES 85% OF FUNDS FROM THE REGIONAL PROGRAM HAVE BEEN INVESTED IN DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. ON WITH RESPECT TO THE RURAL PROGRAM -- WE ANTICIPATED THAT THERE WOULD BE SOME CONCERNED REDUCING THE STATEWIDE PROGRAM -- SIGNIFICANTLY SO WE DID INCREASE THE REGIONAL POT 215% WHICH IS WHAT THE RURAL AND SMALL URBANIZED AREAS HAVE BEEN GETTING TO TO DATE INCLUDING THE STATE WIDE PROGRAM AND THEN OF COURSE RURAL AND SMALL URBANIZED AREAS CAN STILL COMPETE. WITHIN THE STATEWIDE PROGRAM SO THEY'RE KIND OF WOULD ACTUALLY BE RECEIVING POTENTIALLY MORE ON THE WHAT THEY HAD BEEN. I'M IN CLOSING I WOULD JUST -- LIKE TO REITERATE OUR ON DESIRE TO WORK WITH -- THE FOLKS WHO HAVE EXPRESSED IN OPPOSITION AND ASK YOUR AYE VOTE HAPPY TO ASK ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS MORE TOP ON BEHALF OF THE ORANGE COUNTY TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY WE ARE IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE. WE THINK THIS IS -- A GOOD BILL TO IMPROVE TRANSPARENCY AND AND LOCAL CONTROL FOR JUST THE TYPES OF PROJECTS THAT -- ARE WELL SUITED FOR A MORE LOCAL APPROACH -- WE THINK THAT -- WE WE CERTAINLY HAVE -- ANY NUMBER OF PROJECTS IN -- IN OUR REGION -- THAT ARE ARE ARE BENEFICIAL AND REGIONAL IN NATURE BUT SOME ARE ALSO -- VERY SPECIFIC TO SOME OF THE NARROW AREAS AND AND I REGION'S WITHIN OUR ORANGE COUNTY -- JURISDICTION AND THE IDEA OF HONESTLY HAVING SACRAMENTO CHOOSE WHERE WE PLAY SOME OF OUR BIKE ROUTE OR PEDESTRIAN FACILITIES DOESN'T MAKE A WHOLE LOT OF SENSE AND WE THINK THAT BRING THOSE -- DECISIONS TO A LOCAL LEVEL MAKES A WHOLE LOT MORE SENSE WE TOO ARE COMMITTED TO WOULD LIKE TO WORK WITH -- WITH ANYONE WHO DOES HAVE CONCERNS WE THINK THAT WE'RE ALL KIND OF ROLLING TO THE SAME TO IN THE SAME DIRECTION AND THERE'S THERE IS A SOLUTION HERE. THIS GAG REGION -- THE MPO UNDER WHICH WE OPERATE -- ALSO HAS SOME UNIQUENESS AND WE'RE GOING TO BRING SOME OF THOSE -- ISSUES TO THE DISCUSSION AS THE BILL MOVES FOR BUT WE REALLY LOOK FORWARD -- TO TO HAVING THAT CONVERSATION AND FOR TODAY WE DO ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU OTHERS IN SUPPORT. GOOD MORE -- GOOD AFTERNOON MARC WATTS REPRESENTING THE RIVERSIDE COUNTY TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION AND AS WELL. THE SAN FRANCISCO COUNTY TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY WHO ACTED TODAY TO MOVE FORWARD IN SUPPORT POSITION. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON JOE CRUISE ON BEHALF OF CITIES SAN JOSE APPRECIATE THE WORK OF THE AUTHOR AND ORIGINAL VOTE OPPOSITION [inaudible] I THINK [inaudible] THERE'S NO [inaudible] FOR MORE. HE STARTS TO ADDRESS THE NUMBER. RIGHT NOW. AND WE WILL HAVE BY TWO MINUTES REACH SPEAKER PLEASE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS. THANKS AGAIN -- THIS IS ANDREW ANTS WE HEAR ON BEHALF OF THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY METROPOLITAN TRANSPORTATION. AUTHORITY AND WE REALLY REGRET BEING IN THIS POSITION BECAUSE OF OUR GREAT RESPECT FOR THE AUTHOR THE CHAIRMAN OF THE FATHER IN MANY WAYS CASES ALONG WITH MANY OF YOUR EFFORTS. OF SB. ONE WE THINK IT'S PREMATURE TO BE CHANGING. SB ONE FUNDED PROGRAM -- SO EARLY THE INTO THE LIFE OF HAVING SB ONE DOLLARS INFUSION TO THE ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM. WE DON'T THINK OF POLICY BASIS THE CASE HAS BEEN MADE FOR RETOOLING THIS PROGRAM IN THE PROCESS. THIS IS THE FIRST CYCLE AWARE ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION FUNDS HAVE BEEN AWARDED WITH THE INFUSION TO SB ONE DOLLARS HAVE PROVIDED WHICH ESSENTIALLY DOUBLE THE PROGRAM. AND SO WE THINK THERE'S A QUESTION ABOUT IMING WHEN IT COMES TO THE PROPOSAL ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU GO BACK AND YOU LOOK AT THE HISTORY OF HOW MUCH TIME A CALLOUS TA CALTRANS CDC AND OTHERS. HAVE SPENT REACHING OUT TO STAKEHOLDERS TO DEVELOP THE CURRENT GUIDELINES FOR SB ONE OR TWO FOR THE ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM. WE THINK THAT TO HAVE A BILL COME FORWARD IN THIS FASHION UNDER THIS TIMING CONSTRAINTS. DOES NOT PROVIDE ENOUGH -- TIMING AN OPPORTUNITY FOR FOLKS TO WEIGH IN AND WORK WE HAVE SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT ALL JUMP TO GIVEN THE TWO MINUTE TIME CONSTRAINT -- WE REALLY ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE IMPACT FRANKLY IN OUR TERRITORY -- 45% OF THE STATE'S DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES ARE NOTIFIED OF LOS ANGELES COUNTY USING THE CURRENT. ACCOUNT VIRUS FREE MODEL THAT WAS DEVELOPED THROUGH SB -- FIVE THREE FIVE WE ACTUALLY APPRECIATE THE SPONSOR AND THE AUTHORS OF PLEDGE TO MAKE AMENDMENTS TO ESSENTIALLY ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES BUT ADDRESSES IN THE AYE BEHOLDER WE'D LIKE TO BE PART OF THAT. CONVERSATION -- IF IT'S NOT CALLIN VIRAL SCREEN -- THEN WE'RE GOING TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT EXACTLY WHAT MEASURE IN TWO ISSUES GIVEN THE PROPENSITY. OF NEED IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY. ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION PROGRAMS ALSO PROVIDE IMPORTANT SAFETY BENEFIT 30% OF THE SERIOUS AND NON MOTORIZED ENTRIES. TAKE PLACE IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY SO WE WANT TO BE PART OF THE CONVERSATION ONCE AGAIN WE HAVE GREAT RESPECT I THINK THAT WOULD DOES FROM MTC. POINTED TO THE PERFORMANCE. WITH RESPECT TO HAVING PROJECTS INVESTED IN DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES FROM THE CURRENT PROCESS -- WE'RE TALKING OVER THE ONLY -- REPORTS AS 80% OF PROJECTS -- HAVE BEEN INVESTED ACROSS ALL OF THE CYCLES AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AS WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT A CHANGE IN YOU KNOW WHETHER THAT WOULD MEET THAT PERFORMANCE METRIC WHICH IS MUCH HIGHER THAN WHAT THE STATUTE CALLS. FOR THE STATURE CALLS 425- PERCENT. AS A MINIMUM. DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND THE CALAVERAS FREE MODEL IS CLEARED IF CLEARLY DEFINED A STATUTE. AND WE'RE ALSO WORRIED ABOUT THE IMPACT ON IMMEDIATE CYCLES BUT I DID HEAR THE AUTHOR SPEAK TO HIS INTENT -- TO MAKE AN AMENDMENT THAT WOULD ADDRESS THAT TIMING ISSUES BECAUSE FRANKLY THE LAST CYCLE WE SAW A LOT OF INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES AND OUR TERRITORY. AND FRANKLY THE WAY THE BILL BILL AS CURRENTLY DRAFTED -- IT WOULD PUT ALL THOSE AWARDS IN JEOPARDY. BAR REQUIRED THE CTC AND THE APPEALS TO KIND OF SCRATCH WHAT THEY'VE DONE AND START OVER AND SO. THANK YOU SIR YEAR. TWO MINISTRY WITH THOSE REASONS RIPPLES WE PLEDGE TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR GOING FOR WILL HAVE HIM RESPOND TO THOSE. TO THE NEXT [inaudible] HI JULIE [inaudible] OKAY -- WE WORK WITH ME IS IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY ASSEMBLY CAN VALUE CENTER CHIRLA -- WITH THE INCLUSION OF THIS VAST MUSES PART OF THE ATP THROUGHOUT THE STATE PROCESS WE'VE SEEN A PROGRESS THAT IS MORE INCLUSIVE AND TRANSPARENT AND IT WOULD BE OTHERWISE. ON THE TV IS A MODEL OF HOW THE STATE CAN INVEST IN AND ENCOURAGE ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION. WE DON'T SEE HOWEVER -- STRONG REASONING BEHIND THE DRASTIC RE SHIFTING OF THIS PROGRAMS FUNDING WHICH PROVIDES OPPORTUNITIES FOR RURAL COMMUNITIES AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES THROUGH THE STATE -- PROCESS -- BY PUTTING A LARGE PORTION INTO A REGIONAL PROGRAM. CURRENTLY THIS REGIONAL PROGRAMS NOT WELL DEFINED IN TERMS OF TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY -- WHICH ARE TWO OF OUR MAJOR CONCERNS. IN ADDITION THERE'S ALSO A REDUCTION -- OVER ALL OF THE AVAILABLE POTENTIAL FUNDS THAT WOULD BE AVAILABLE FOR RURAL COMMUNITIES -- DESPITE THE 15% OF THE TOTAL AVAILABLE FUNDS THAT WOULD BE MADE -- AVAILABLE FOR RURAL COMMUNITIES TO COMPETE FOR OUR OVERALL -- DWINDLING. THE CURRENT STRUCTURE THE TV IS RELATIVELY EFFECTIVE AND WE'RE CONCERNED THAT THE SHIFT BEING PROPOSED HERE CURRENTLY DOES NOT ENSURE THAT THE HISTORICAL THIS INVESTMENT IN LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR WILL NOT BE EXACERBATED AT THE REGIONAL LEVEL. UNFORTUNATELY THE NEEDS AND PRIORITIES AT THE COMMUTE WITH OF THE COMMUNITIES THAT WE WORK WITH ARE OFTEN NOT PARTICULARLY WELL REPRESENTED BY REGIONAL AGENCIES. AND IT'S IMPORTANT THAT AT THE VERY LEAST THERE BACKSTOPS THE MECHANISMS FOR TRANSPARENCY WHICH THE STATE CAN HAVE A CRITICAL ROLE IN -- JUST AN EXAMPLE CV LANGKAH PROJECT IN THE COACHELLA VALLEY. IT'S A LARGE PROJECTS THAT EVEN INCLUDES THINGS LIKE INFRASTRUCTURE FOR GOLF CARTS -- IN REALITY THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S NOT BENEFITING DISAPPEARS COMMUNITY COULD TELL LIKE THOSE IN THE EASTERN COACHELLA VALLEY THAT WE WORK WITH -- JUST AN EXAMPLE OF HOW REGIONAL PRIORITY SOMETIMES DON'T LINE UP WITH THOSE OF THE COMMUNITY -- DISADVANTAGE ON A CORPORATE COMMUNITIES AND RURAL AREAS OFTEN NEED SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS SIDEWALKS -- WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE COMMUNITY STILL HAVE A CHANCE AT THIS -- OPPORTUNITY SO THESE ARE JUST SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT WE HOLD ON SB ONE THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME THANK YOU NEXT. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS GUS CORN WE HAVE TO TRANSPORTATION AGENCY OF MONTEREY COUNTY AND STANISLAUS COUNCIL OF GOVERNMENTS WE HAVE CONCERNS SON NOT OFFICIAL POST POSITION. HAVE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF DEFERENCE FOR SENATE BILL WOULD VERY CLOSELY WITH HIM ON THE ESTABLISHMENT OF SEVERAL TO COMPETITIVE POGRAMS SO JUST A COUPLE QUICK POINTS I THINK. ONE CONCERN IS WE DON'T WANT TO PUT AN ARTIFICIAL CAP UP ON THE FUNDING WHERE WERE PARSON OUT THE FUNDING SO THAT EVERYBODY'S GETTING A SLIVER NO ONE'S GETTING FED SO THAT WE'RE NOT. EXPEDITING OR DELIVERING PROJECTS OF SIGNIFICANCE I THINK THAT'S ONE CONCERN WE ARE EXTREMELY CONCERNED HOWEVER ABOUT GEOGRAPHIC EQUITY AND THAT'S SOMETHING I KNOW THE CENTERS CONCERNED ABOUT. TO THE PARTICULAR OUTCOME BUT CYCLE -- FOR BUT FOR SMALLER JURISDICTIONS YOU DO GET BANG FOR YOUR BUCK -- WHEN YOU INVEST ALONG THE CENTRAL COAST AND EVEN CENTRAL VALLEY AND SOME OF THE DISSIDENTS COMMUNITIES THAT MR ENTRY EVEN MENTIONED -- SO I THINK FOR THOSE REASONS PLUS -- WE DO THINK THAT IT IS WORTH EXPLORING -- THE EVALUATION CRITERIA IT'S SORT OF A CLUNKY. EVALUATION WHEN YOU'VE GOT SOMEBODY SAY FROM YOU KNOW HUMBOLDT THAT'S PROBABLY EVALUATING A PROJECT IN ORANGE COUNTY WHERE THEY DON'T REALLY HAVE A TRUE APPRECIATION -- UNDERSTANDING OF THAT PROJECT IN THE COUNTY SO FOR THOSE REASONS I THINK WE WANT TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR WE LOOK FOR TO BEING INCLUDING THOSE CONVERSATION SO. THANK YOU SENATOR BELL AND THANK YOU MANAGER. THANK YOU OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. HI ANSWER OF AIR WITH CALIFORNIA LOCKS AND WE'VE BEEN AND CONTINUE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE OFFICE AND SPONSORS THEY'RE STILL SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED INCLUDING THE STATED DURING TESTIMONY AND AND I LETTER THAT WAS SUBMITTED. TO THE COMMITTEE -- OUR CONCERNS GO AGAIN JUST TO ECHO THE DRASTIC CHANGE IN FUNDING STRUCTURE -- AND WHERE IT BUT WE'RE INVESTED IN IMPROVING THE ATP AND HAVE BEEN HOW WILLING AND KEY TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH THE OFFICE TO ADDRESS OUR CONCERNS. BUT UNFORTUNATELY AT THIS TIME YOU MUST MAINTAIN OUR POST UNLESS AMENDED POSITION. YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON JONATHAN MATCH WITH THE SAFE AT SCHOOL NATIONAL PARTNERSHIP WE'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN THE THE SAME DISCUSSIONS AND MAINTAIN OUR OUR CURRENT OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED OPPOSITION BURKE LOOKING FORWARD TO WORKING MORE WITH -- THOSE CENTERS OFFICE TO ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE CONCERNS JUST WANTED -- TO MENTION ONE ADDITIONAL ELEMENTS OF OUR CONCERN ABOUT THE BILL -- WHICH IS THAT WE REALLY VIEW THE EIGHTY P. AS A CURRENTLY STANDS AS A MODEL OF TRANSPARENCY AND SAY WHAT BY IN -- WITH MORE THAN TEN WORKSHOPS HAPPENING ACROSS THE STATE LOTS OF OPPORTUNITIES ARE STAKEHOLDERS TO BE INVOLVED AND AND THAT HAS RESULTED IN MORE THAN A HUNDRED VOLUNTEER EVALUATORS -- GIVING THIRTY HOURS OF THEIR TIME ON AVERAGE -- TO INVEST IN THE PROGRAM -- IT'S A TRIPLE BLIND PROCESS -- THAT'S FREE OF BIAS AND WE WOULD REALLY BE CONCERNED ABOUT -- ABOUT EVACUATING THAT -- STATEWIDE CONSTITUENCY THAT'S BEEN BUILT UP AROUND ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION BY DEVOLVING INTO THE REGION'S THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON THEN THE COMMISSION WITH A CALIFORNIA BICYCLE COALITION ALSO HERE A TO ECHO I MY COLLEAGUES AND IN OUR POSITION THAT WE DO HAVE CONCERNS AT THIS IS A IT THIS IS AN ANOMALY PROGRAM FOR THE STATE WHERE THERE'S HEAVY STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT. THE CDC HAS MADE EVERY EFFORT TO COORDINATE AND AND NEGOTIATE AMONG FOLKS ACROSS THE STATE AND SO WE YOU KNOW WE'D LIKE TO SEE A BIT MORE. AT OUR REGION ENGAGEMENT AROUND HOW TO MAKE THOSE. CHANGES -- WE FEEL THAT IF THIS IS NOT GOING TO GET IT GO INTO EFFECT UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY THREE WHICH WOULD THEN BE THE THE THE END OF THIS CURRENT PROGRAM. THEN WE WE WOULD LIKE TO TAKE THAT TIME TO CONSIDER ALL OF THE CONCERNS AND WORK OUT THE RIGHT AT AMENDMENTS TO WHAT WE CAN DO FOR THIS PROGRAM. THE OTHER THING I WOULD SAY THAT THANK YOU THANK YOU NEXT. GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS ON THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MISTER CHAIR -- MY NAME IS CAITLYN DEAN WITH POLICY LINK AND WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED FOR ALL THE REASONS STATED BY CALIFORNIA WALKS AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR. YOU CAN'T. I COMMITTEE MEMBERS. YOUR FRIENDS REQUIRE. THANK YOU SO MUCH MAN CHAIR. ONE IS A IF I AM TO THE CHAIR FOR ALL OF HIS WORK THAT HE HAS. DONE AND CONTINUES TO DO FOR STATEWIDE TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS -- HAD OPPORTUNITY TO MEET WITH THE CHAIR -- ON THIS BILL AND I REALLY APPRECIATE AT THE CHAIR TAKING TIME SPECIALLY LATE YESTERDAY EVENING HAVING THE CONVERSATION. MISTER CHAIR MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT -- THE MY UNDERSTANDING. IS THAT AS YOU MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS BILL YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE CLER THAT -- THIS BILL DOES NOT IMPACT CURRENT FUNDING LA ALLOCATION THROUGH APPROXIMATE TWENTY TWENTY THREE WHICH I BELIEVE THAT SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION ROLLS THROUGH. YEAH THAT'S TRUE YEAH WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE GONNA HAVE A SMOOTH TRANSITION WE'RE NOT GONNA -- CHAU BACK MONEY ON CURRENT PROJECTS NOW. THANK YOU SO MUCH AND I THINK THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT. ONE OF THE WITNESSES SAID THAT AT THIS CURRENT FORMULA DOES NOT IMPACT RULE I I I DON'T BELIEVE THAT WITNESS LIVES IN A RURAL AREA -- IN THIS KERN FOR ME THAT WOULD IMPACT -- RURAL AND WHAT I REALLY APPRECIATE -- THE CHAIR SAYING HE SAID HE'S GONNA CONTINUE TO WORK ON THAT FORMULA -- AND WORK WITH INTERESTED PARTIES AS WE MOVE FORWARD IN THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD IN GOOD FAITH -- TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT FIGURE OUT WHERE THAT SWEET SPOT IS -- IN REGARDS TO THE FORMULA AS WE MOVE FORWARD AND I THINK THAT WOULD BE A FAIR ASSESSMENT MR. YES THAT'S TRUE AND THE YEAH THAT'S TRUE BASICALLY THE FORMULA IS THE KEY ISSUE. I PERSONALLY BELIEVE THAT THESE TYPES OF PROJECTS. SHOULD BE MORE PROPERLY HANDLED. AT THE LOCAL THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT OR THE REGIONAL GOVERNMENT LEVEL. BECAUSE I THINK THEY'RE THE TYPE OF PROJECTS. THAT OF REGIONAL LOCAL GOVERNMENTS DO THAT'S ESSENTIALLY WHY AGAIN OR JUST THE BILL. I DON'T THINK THE STATE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION I'LL BE LOOKING AT SMALL BICYCLE PATHS AND THINGS LIKE THAT THAT'S KIND OF NOT THE ROLE IT WAS NEVER THEIR INTENTION AND SP ONE TO HAVE THEM. GO TO THIS. MASSIVE EFFORT TO DO ALL THIS AND HIRE MORE STAFF AND ROCK PROCEED TO THE CURRENT. THAT KIND OF THING IS MORE APPROPRIATE TO HAVE THE THE LOCAL STEWART SO BUT WE WANT TO HAVE A STATEWIDE PROGRAM. A A REGIONAL PROGRAM AND A SMALL. A RURAL CITY PROGRAM -- ON ALSO SAY THAT I'M. EXTREMELY CONCERNED ABOUT THE DISADVANTAGE COMMITTEE BECAUSE I THINK THIS IS A TRUE STATEMENT PEOPLE MAY TO WE HAVE. TO APPROACH THIS FROM THE STANDPOINT. THAT -- SOME COMMUNITIES HAVE NOT RECEIVED THEIR ADEQUATE SHARE OF SUPPORT -- FOR WALKWAYS SAFE ROUTES TO SCHOOL. BIKE WAYS PATHWAYS AND WE SHOULD NEVER HURTS PROMOTE THAT. YEAH -- IN OUR DISCUSSIONS NOT APPRECIATE IMAGES HERE AND I THINK THAT IN JUST CLOSING HERE AND JUST TAKING A LOOK AT WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING IN THE CALIFORNIA'S PETITION COMMISSION IN ITS CURRENT FORMULA. WHAT I WILL SAY IS IN THE UNDER THIS CURRENT FORMULA RULE CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN ABLE TO RECEIVE AT LEAST IN RECENT? AND MOST RECENT YEARS SINCE THE PASSAGE OF SB ONE IN THIS FIRST YEAR. THERE HAS BEEN BENEFIT -- AND I WILL SAY IN OUR BACKYARD AND SOME OF THE MOST RULES SPOTS -- IN CALIFORNIA THROUGH MENDOCINO AS WELL AS HUMBLE ON THE GREAT RIDLEY TRAILING TRANSITIONING THAT FUNCTION THE BANKRUPT -- RAIL SYSTEM INTO A WORLD CLASS TRAIL SYSTEM THAT WILL GO THROUGH AND TWENTY MILES CDC HAS BEEN -- HAS BEEN A GREAT HELP FOR THAT. AND WHAT I'LL SAY IS -- I'M GREATLY APPRECIATIVE OF THE CHAIR AND HIS WILLINGNESS TO B ABLE TO WORK THROUGH THIS ISSUE% I HAVE. HAD THE PLEASURE TO WORK THROUGH THAT MANY OF ISSUES WHETHER IT'S REACHED A MEASURE. THREE OR SENATE BILL -- ONE INDIA IS ALWAYS BEEN A PERSON'S WORD -- IN UNDERSTANDING THERE WILL BE CHANGES -- TO THE FORMULA TODAY -- AND AND WORKING WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS -- WILL BE SUPPORTIVE OF THE BILL. Q. AND SKINNER [inaudible] THANK. I'M SO CENTER ABOUT THEM THE WHAT WHERE I'M HAVING OR MS I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S CONFUSED OR IS [inaudible] THE I WOULD LIKE YOU I THINK I WOULD PROBABLY HAVE. JUMPED OR NOT I WOULD HAVE. NOT ASSUMED BUT FIGURED THAT. THE LOCAL ENTITIES WOULD HAVE A BETTER SENSE OF WHAT WAS NEEDED ON THE GROUND IN THAT ARE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES IN OUR BY SCHOOL TYPE PROJECTS NO WOULD GET A FAIR. SHAKE THAT WAY VERSES FROM A STATEWIDE ENTITY. BUT WE HAVE IN TERMS THE OPPOSITION TO YOUR BILL WE HAVE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES WHO ARE. OPPOSING WHO SEEM TO PREFER THE STATE WIDE STRUCTURE. AS WELL AS SOME OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS LIKE THE LA COUNTY DEBT -- DEAD INCLUDE MANY THESE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES THIS IS WHERE I'M HAVING A LITTLE TROUBLE I'M HAVING TO DISCONNECT. WELL -- JUST TO BACKGROUND WISE -- THE ATP PROGRAM -- YOU CAN SEE THE RIVER THE STAFF REPORT CARD DESCRIBES THE ATP PROGRAM. IT WAS ORIGINALLY FUNDED -- IS START THE THE FUNDING WAS STARTED -- AND THEY FUNDED TO SIMPLY ABOUT A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR OKAY THAT WAS THE ORIGINAL. FUNDING LEVEL FOR THE ATP PROGRAM. AND SB ONE PASSED IN SB ONE ADDED. A SECOND HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. AND THEN WITH -- DOUBT IN OTHER FUNDS -- THIS LAST YEAR -- I THINK THE ALLOCATED TWO HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. SO YOU GET HOW IT. THIS PROGRAM GREW -- WHEN THE PROGRAM GREW -- THE STATE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION. A DECISION THAT [inaudible] BASICALLY. ALLOCATED SOME MONEY -- FOR THE REGIONAL [inaudible] TRANSPORTATION PLANS THAT ARE INCLUDING -- WALKWAYS BIKE WAYS ALTERNATE TRANSPORTATION. AND THE REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION PLANS ARE REQUIRED TO HAVE THAT IN THE REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION PLAN. TO REDUCE -- THE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS IN ACCORDANCE WITH -- SB YOUTH THREE SEVENTY FIVE OKAY SO THEY HAVE TO HAVE. THIS AIR QUALITY ELEMENT BIKE WAYS PATHWAYS AND SO FORTH IN ADDITION TO SAY FROM SCHOOL. SHOULD BE INCLUDED. SO -- THE REGIONAL PLANS ACTUALLY HAVE A SPECIFIC. MANDATE. TO LOOK AT AIR QUALITY TO LOOK AT OF PLANNING OF ALTERNATIVE TRANSPORTATION TO DO A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN. TO COORDINATE WITH THE REGIONAL AIR QUALITY BOARDS -- AS WELL AS THE LOCAL COUNTY EACH COUNTY HAS -- CONGESTION MANAGEMENT AGENCY AND THEY HAVE TO CONTRIBUTE AND DO A LOCAL PLAN TO DO THE SAME EXACT THING. SO I THINK THAT FOR ME -- THE PLANNING PROCESS IS MORE STRUCTURED. IT'S MORE. FIVE SET UP TO MEET CERTAIN GOALS. OF ITS -- BY STATUTE BY LEGISLATIVE STATUTE AS OPPOSED TO THE CALIFORNIA TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION COMING UP WITH A BUNCH OF CRITERIA WHICH THEY DID. LIKE. SEVERAL PAGES LONG. OF HOW TO ALLOCATE THE FUNDS. SO THEY CAME UP WITH THIS CRITERIA THEN THEY CREATED THESE -- TEAMS OF EVALUATORS AND EVALUATORS WERE VOLUNTEERS AND THE VOLUNTEERS EVALUATE THE PROJECTS. AND THEN THEY CAME UP WITH THE ALLOCATION OF THE TWO HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. SO FOR ME I THINK A MORE STRUCTURED PROFESSIONAL -- PUBLIC INPUT WISE -- THE REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION PLANNING PROCESS IS A VERY INVOLVED. TRANSPARENCY PUBLIC PROCESS THERE'S A LOT OF DEBATE THERE'S PLENTY OF MEETINGS WE ALL KNOW THAT. AND I THINK THAT'S A MUCH BETTER WAY OF DOING THIS FOR THESE TYPES OF PROJECTS. HOWEVER THE THE BILL DOES NOT. TAKE AWAY ALL THE FUNDS -- FOR THE STATE IT LEAVES A SIGNIFICANT PART OF MONEY FOR THE STATE. TO ALLOCATE TO THE PROJECTS SIMILAR TO WHAT CENTER REQUIRES TALKING ABOUT OR OTHER STATEWIDE. PROJECTS OR OTHER PROJECTS THAT. MAYBE HELP BALANCE THE THE DESIRES OF COMMUNITIES TO HAVE A LARGER SKILL [inaudible] LARGER PROJECTS. SO I I BELIEVE THAT THE SIZE OF THESE PROJECTS THE PLANNING PROCESS THAT WE HAVE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AND THE REGIONAL LEVEL. IS MUCH MORE STRUCTURED MORE. MORE PUBLIC PROCESS ORIENTED. MORE PROFESSIONAL. THEN -- THE PROCESS USE NOW AT THE STATEWIDE LEVEL SO. THAT'S WHY I'VE I'VE INTRODUCED A BILL. I'M TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH -- THE GOALS THAT I WANT TO ACCOMPLISH -- I'M GOING TO HAVE TO WORK ON IT AS YOU CAN SEE THERE'S OTHER THINGS I HAVE TO WORK ON BUT I INTEND TO WORK ON I I RECOGNIZE THAT THESE ARE ISSUES WE HAVE TO WORK ON SO. I'M I'M OTHER THAN WHAT WAS SAID IN THE TESTIMONY -- IT'S YOU KNOW I DON'T FULLY UNDERSTAND WHY THE DIFFERENT -- REPRESENTATIVES OF THE DISADVANTAGE -- COMMUNITY GROUPS FUEL THAT THE WOULD APPEAR FEEL THAT THEY WOULD NOT HAVE IS FEAR OF A HEARING UNDER THE PROCESS THAT YOU'RE. PROPOSING SO I KNOW THAT YOU'VE JUST EXPRESSED. THEIR WILLINGNESS TO WORK IN ABOUT IT I THINK THERE IS A CONTINUE TO WORK WITH OKAY OF ALL AND CONTINUE TO TALK TO ON THE CARD IS GOING TO BE A A PROCESS [inaudible] SENATOR RUBIO. THANK YOU. ARE WELL I'M HAVING -- WELL FIRST FIGHT AS WELL AS A RESPECT THE AUTHOR TREMENDOUSLY ESPECIALLY I KNOW THAT YOUR KNOWLEDGE OF ONE THOUGHTFUL AS A PERTAINS TO OUT TRANSPORTATION BUT I'M HAVING A LITTLE BIT OF DISCONNECT AS WELL AS SENATOR SKINNER. MENTIONED TA IN PARTICULAR BECAUSE I HAPPEN TO REPRESENT LOS ANGELES COUNTY AS WELL AND AND WE DO HAVE -- QUITE A BIT AND NEED IN THOSE COMMUNITIES AND SO -- AGAIN I DON'T WANT TO BELABOR THE POINT SINCE EVERYONE EXPRESSED SOME OF MY CONCERNS AND DIE I ALSO FEEL THERE IS A LITTLE BIT MORE WORK IN THAT AREA AND AND I WANT TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH YOU IN TERMS OF TRYING TO SEE WE CAN -- SOME OF THOSE CONCERNS BUT AT THIS MOMENT I I JUST CANNOT GET THERE -- I REALLY WOULD LOVE TO CONTINUE THIS DISCUSSION AND AND SEE HOW I CAN GET TO YES THANK YOU. REGARDLESS OF HOW WE COME OUT HERE ALL THE HAPPY TO WORK WITH ALL THE MEMBERS IS GOING TO BE -- OF IMPORTANT PROCESS SO TO GET THIS FINISHED. THANK YOU SENATOR BAIL I DON'T SEE ANY OTHER COMMITTEE MEMBERS WANTING TO LIVE. ASK A QUESTION SO -- YOU MAY CLOSE -- I'M COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH ALL THE MEMBERS AND AND BOTH THE OPPOSITION SUPPORTERS TRY. TO ACHIEVE. OF SOME. FORM OF AN AGREEMENT -- SOMETIMES WE CAN'T PLEASE EVERYBODY WITH EVERYTHING THEY WANT BUT AT THE SAME TIME -- SINCE I SPENT FOUR YEARS WORKING ON SB. ONE COMING CLOSE TO THAT I MEAN I THINK IT'S SOME OF USE SUPPORTING IT BUT THAT'S OKAY -- I'D BE HAPPY TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH EVERYBODY AND I THINK THE RESULTS GOING TO BE -- A STRONG PROGRAM FOR ALTERNATE TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM THAT WILL MEET THE NEEDS OF CALIFORNIA THROUGHOUT. THROUGHOUT THE STATE AN ORIGINAL VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR BAIL -- I ALL MOVE THE BILL I WANT TO APPRECIATE. PUBLICLY YOUR EFFORTS ON THIS TO BRING IT DOWN TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT DECISION MAKING HAVING SERVED ON THE ORANGE COUNTY TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT. AND IT CERTAINLY VERY IMPORTANT IN TERMS OF RECOGNIZING SOME OF THE THINGS THAT. ARE THE OPPOSITION IS BROUGHT FORWARD BECAUSE THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT THINGS THAT ARE VERY IMPORTANT TO THEIR COMMUNITIES TO SO -- WITHOUT TO ALL ASKED US SECRETARY CALL THE ROLL PARTY MOVED. YOU'RE TOO LATE SENATOR. HELLO. THE THING ABOUT ONE FIFTY TWO BY SENATOR ABOUT THE MOTION IS TO PASS AND REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS. SAID ABOUT. WELL I BATES RIGHT BATES AYE DODD GALGIANI. MCGUIRE MORALE [inaudible] ROTH [inaudible] RUBIO [inaudible] SKINNER. STONE SKINNER AYE STONE STONE I AMBER. AMBER I WILL CASKEY BECAUSE HE AYE [inaudible] YEAH. SIX ZERO WILL HOLD THE ROLE OPEN ON THAT ONE SENATOR BAIL WINDOW WILL MOVE TO YOUR NEXT BILL. MEMBERS WHICH MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT EASIER WILL SAY -- MEMBERS THIS IS SB. TWO ONE ONE OKAY. CALIFORNIA HAS MADE IT CLEAR THE DRESSING HOMELESSNESS IS A TOP PRIORITY. NOW IN EVERY ONE OF OUR COMMUNITIES THERE THE PEOPLE ARE LOOKING FOR SOLUTIONS AND CALTRANS. CURRENTLY HAS AUTHORITY IN A HANDFUL OF JURISDICTIONS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. A JUST A SMALL YOU KNOW A FEW JURISDICTIONS -- TO LEASE. PROPERTY FOR HOMELESS SHELTER PROGRAMS AT BELOW MARKET RATE. THE AUTHORITY GIVES THE CITIES AND COUNTIES A HELPFUL TOOL TO ADDRESS CALIFORNIA'S SIGNIFICANT HOMELESS CRISIS. NOW FOR REFERENCE ALL READ THEM TO YOU SEE YOU KNOW WHICH ONES HAVE THIS AUTHORITY OKAY. SERRA CISCO SANTA BARBARA COUNTY CITY OF SAN DIEGO SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY O'QUINN'S A LOS ANGELES AND SAN JOSE -- THAT'S IT. THE REALITY IS THAT PEOPLE ARE CAMPING AND SLEEPING IN THESE PROPERTIES ALREADY ON CALTRANS PROPERTY IN CALTRANS ACTUALLY. SPENDS MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN EACH YEAR CLEANING OUT CAMPS. THEY SPENT TEN MILLION DOLLARS CLEANING OUT CAMPS IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY ALONE. TEN MILLION DOLLARS. SO THAT'S NOT A SOLUTION. CITIES AND COUNTIES NEED TO BE ABLE TO PARTNER. WITH CAL TRANS TO COME UP WITH REAL SOLUTIONS TO CONNECT PEOPLE WITH HOUSING AND SERVICES. AND LAST YEAR WE AUTHORED A BILL THAT GAVE THIS AUTHORITY TO LOS ANGELES AND SAN JOSE. THERE THEY MAY HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE THEY MAYMAY HAVE TAKEN DISADVANTAGED AND ARE WORKING ON SEVERAL PROJECTS. TO MEET IMMEDIATE AND PRESSING NEEDS FOR SHELTER AND SERVICES. THE TIME IS NOW TO EXTEND THE SOLUTION TO STATEWIDE. SO THE OTHER CITIES AND COUNTIES. HAVE THE OPTION THIS IS AN OPTIONAL THING. TO LOOK AT THIS IN THEIR COMMUNITIES AND THE BILL WOULD ALLOW CALTRANS. TO LEASE RES REELS PROPERTY TO CITIES AND COUNTIES. IN IT ANYWHERE IN THE STATE FOR THE PURPOSES OF STASHING EMERGENCY SHELTER FEEDING PROGRAM. FOR DOLLAR MONTH. IT CAPS ADMINISTRATORS FEES AT FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS AND PROTECTS. EXISTING AUTHORITY BASED ON PASS LEGISLATION WE WANT CITIES ALREADY DOING THIS DEVOID NICK AND NEW ADMINISTRATIVE OF HURDLES AND WE HAVE SOME WITNESSES ALL TURN OVER THE WITNESSES. GOOD AFTERNOON -- STEVE CREWS ON BEHALF OF THE CITY OF SAN JOSE HERE IN SUPPORT OF A SENATE BILL. TWO ELEVEN VERY BRIEFLY -- WHEN I THINK THE SENATOR FOR INTRODUCING THE BILL? UNLIKE OTHER CITIES -- CENTERS A. SUFFERS FROM A SEVERE HOUSING AFFORDABILITY CRISIS AND EGGS EXACERBATE ARE HOMELESS PROBLEM. AS PART OF THE CITY SOLUTION. IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN MAY PROVE TO SITES -- FOR WHAT THEY CALL THEIR BRIDGE -- HOUSING COMMUNITIES THESE ARE -- TINY HOMES -- THAT HAVE -- A LIVABLE SPACE BUT HAVE COMMUNITY BATHROOMS IN IN KITCHENS AND COMMUNAL SPACE FOR LEARNING AND THINGS LIKE THAT SO IT PROVIDES A SAFE PLACE -- TYPICALLY THREE TO SIX MONTHS WHAT WE LOOK FOR TO TRANSITION THESE FOLKS TO PERMANENT -- HOUSING -- LAST YEAR WONDER SB -- FIVE NINETEEN THAT ALLOW THE THE CITY TO NEGOTIATE WITH CALTRANS FOR THESE BELOW MARKET LIKE REESE'S LEASES ARE -- IS MADE OF THESE PROJECTS MORE ECONOMICALLY FEASIBLE -- FOR THE CITY -- WE THINK THAT OF HAVE THE SAME BENEFITS ACROSS THE STATE AND SO WE REQUEST THE SIR QUESTION WE'RE SUPPORT -- REQUEST SUPPORT FOR THE BILL SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GOOD AFTERNOON CONSOLE HERNANDEZ DIRECTOR OF GOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS FOR THE CITY OF SACRAMENTO. A SIMILAR TO SAN JOSE IN OTHER CITIES WE'RE FACING A HOMELESSNESS CRISIS I JUST WANNA GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT THIS BILL WOULD MEAN TO THE CITY. OF WE HAVE COMMITTED TO OPENING UP EIGHT HUNDRED SHELTER BEDS -- TO HOUSE OUR HOUSE OUR MOST VULNERABLE PEOPLE OF FOR THE PAST SIXTEEN MONTHS WE HAVE OPERATED A LOW BARRIER SHELTER -- THAT HIS HOUSE SIX HUNDRED FIFTY PEOPLE 40% HAVE BEEN RE HOUSING MEDICAL SERVICES. HOWEVER THIS SHELTER IS IN A PRIVATELY LEAST WAREHOUSE WE SPEND TWO HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH ON THE SHELTERING. AND FORTY THOUSAND ARE I'M SORRY THOUSAND GOES TO LEASE AND FACILITY COSTS -- WE'RE LOOKING TO EXPAND SHELTERS IT'S CRITICAL THAT WE FIND MORE COST EFFECTIVE LOCATIONS -- EVERY DOLLAR THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO SPEND ON A LEASE IS MONEY THAT COULD BE SPEND -- FOR SERVICES ON FOR HOMELESS PEOPLE WE CURRENTLY ARE WORKING WITH CALTRANS ON A POTENTIAL LOCATION -- IN IT YEAH AS THE SENATOR MENTIONED -- THE LOCATION CURRENTLY IS A DE FACTO HOMELESSNESS SHELTERS SO WHEN YOU CREATE AN ACTUAL FACILITY -- IT GETS PEOPLE WHO ALREADY YEAR THEY'RE OFF THE STREETS IT CLEANS UP THE AREA IT'S IT'S A WIN WIN FOR EVERYONE INVOLVED -- SB TWO ELEVEN WOULD PROVIDE CALTRANS STAFF THE DIRECTION THEY NEED TO MOVE QUICKLY -- TO PROVE THIS SITE AND OTHERS ACROSS THE STATE SO -- THIS IS WHY WE'RE SUPPORTING IN WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU THANK YOU. OTHERS IN SUPPORT OF MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS MICHAEL RIGHT AGAIN ON BEHALF OF THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS OF SANTA CLARA COUNTY. AND I'VE ALO BEEN ASKED -- TO RELAY THE SUPPORT OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES. YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU. HI GOOD AFTERNOON RUN WE DO HERE ON BEHALF OF THE LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA CITIES -- WE'RE KIND OF IN AN IN BETWEEN WEAR SUPPORT FOR MANDATE -- WE'RE LOOKING -- FOR TECHNICAL KERR FOR CATION THAT. WOULD ESSENTIALLY REQUIRE SITTING COUNTY APPROVAL OF THESE. LEASE AGREEMENTS WHICH WE THINK IS CONSISTENT WITH THE AUTHOR'S INTENT BUT AND WE WILLING TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR AND OBVIOUSLY -- REALLY ADMIRE YOUR YOUR YOUR CHAMPION -- YOUR YOUR CAMPING OF THESE ISSUES SO I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR HIS LEADERSHIP ON THIS THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY OTHER AHS SUPPORT. ALL THOSE IN OPPOSITION ANY. IN OUR COMMITTEE MEMBERS. I DON'T KNOW IF WE HAVE MOVED OUT [inaudible] SENATOR STONE. I WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE ON SENATOR BILL -- MEMBERS I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH MONEY CALTRANS SPENDS ON PICKING UP GARBAGE IN CLEANING UP. THE FREEWAYS EXTRA DO THE HOMELESS ENCAMPMENTS. BUT I KNOW I DO KNOW IF IT'S A IF THEY SPEND. IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY TEN MILLION DOLLARS. IT MUST BE. QUITE A BIT OF MONEY. AND I THINK RATHER THAN SIT BACK AND SAY IT'S SOMEBODY ELSE'S RESPONSIBILITY THINK THIS IS A PROACTIVE WAY OF WORKING ON THIS ISSUE I REGION I VOTE I THINK WILL. HELP PEOPLE IN. IT'LL BE GOOD -- FOR HOMELESS. PROGRAMS TO ETTER COORDINATE WITH THE CALTRANS IN THE OTHER AGENCIES THANK YOU. A CALL THE ROLL. THE SENATE BILL TWO ELEVEN BY SENATOR ABOUT THE MOTION IS TO PASS AND REFER TO THE COMEDIAN APPROPRIATIONS. CENTER ABOUT. WELL I BATES SITES BATES I DON. DODD AYE GALGIANI MCGUIRE MORALE ROUGH RUBIO. RUBIO AYE SKINNER -- AYE STONE. STONE I AMBER. AMBER I WILL COUNTY WE GOT THE AYE. SENATOR BILLS YOU'RE HALFWAY THERE IS A LET'S MOVE ON THIS WAS EVEN SHORTER. THE GENDER ITEM NINE SB. FOUR SIX WE HAD A HEARING ON MANAGER -- MEMBERS WE HAD A HEARING ON THE DMV AND AND AS A RESULT OF THAT HEARING -- I HAVE A BILL I AM INTRODUCING -- THIS BILL AND ONE OTHER BILL. WHICH WILL COME LATER -- THIS BILL AUTHORIZES BUT IT'S NOT REQUIRED DMV TO ESTABLISH A TO YOUR VEHICLE REGISTRATION PROGRAM. THIS SHOULD HELP DMV REDUCES WORKLOAD AS VEHICLE OWNERS WOULD REGISTER TO VEHICLES LESS OFTEN -- MAKING FEWER VISITS A DMV OF COURSE THERE'S IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES TO BE CONSIDERED AND I ASKED THE EMPTY FOR THEIR THOUGHTS ON THIS SO I GET RECEIVE RESPONSE ACTUALLY HELLO WELL. WE HAVE THE HEARING. SEVERAL GROUPS HAVE EXPRESSED -- THEIR CONCERNS ABOUT THE IDEA AND I'M HAPPY TO WORK WITH THEM ON THEIR CONCERNS. WE WE SHOULD KEEP IN MIND THE MOTEL YOUR REGISTRATION IDEAS NOT NEW IS AVAILABLE IN MANY STATES ACTUALLY AROUND THE COUNTRY THIS IS QUITE COMMON. DID YOU CAN REGISTRY VEHICLE FOR MORE IN ONE YEAR IT'S JUST SOMETHING WE HAVEN'T DONE HERE. AND IT'S AVAILABLE -- THE BILL THE BILL SHOULD BE -- A VEHICLE FOR OTHER IDEAS IMPROVING EFFICIENCY A DMV. I AM WELCOME TO THE COMMITTEES IDEAS OF FROM ALL MEMBERS -- PROVIDING FOR WHATEVER LEGISLATION DIRECTION THEY MIGHT FIND APPROPRIATE THESE IDEAS COULD MAYBE COME UP IN THE CONTINUING. WORK OF THE DIEM THE STRIKE TEAM WHICH WERE GOING TO GET REPORTS SIMENON. AND DISCUSSIONS WITH THE ADMINISTRATION'S ABOUT THEIR TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR PLUS BUDGET REQUEST THROUGH THE DMV SO. THOSE OF US THAT HAVE TO DEAL WITH THAT IN THE BUDGET COMMITTEES OF A BABY WE OUGHT TO LOOK AT HOW THEY CAN SAVE MONEY AND GO LET'S TAKE SOME. LET'S TAKE SOME EFFORT AND TIME AND LOOK AT EFFICIENCIES SO URGENT A VOTE ON THIS BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU ARE THOSE IN SUPPORT. STICK IT TO BE PART OF THOSE IN OPPOSITION. OUR VAN TO THE COMMITTEE -- SENATOR STONE I THINK YOU WERE FIRST THANK YOU -- SENATOR BILL I I THINK IT'S A GREAT IDEA I REALLY LIKE IT I JUST. IS ARE GONNA BE PORTABILITY WHERE SOMEBODY CAN CHOOSE WHAT THEY WANT TO GO ONE YEAR TO YEAR BECAUSE FOR SOME PEOPLE IN MY CAN YOU KNOW YEAH I THINK THAT'S GENERALLY THE IDEA OKAY I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE FOR THE RECORD THAT'S THERE BECAUSE I WANT TO SUPPORT YOUR BILL. NOT MY CONCERN IS A SOME MY LOWER INCOME FOLKS MAY NOT BE ABLE TO AFFORD TO YEARS ALL AT ONCE SO YOU REALIZE WE HAVE THIRTY FOUR THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND VEHICLES IN CALIFORNIA I MEAN. IF WE CAN TAKE SOME OF THOSE VEHICLES SEVERAL MILLION I HOPE. THAT WE CAN REGISTER FOR MORE IN ONE YEAR THAT WOULD. OBVIOUSLY HAVE AN IMPACT CURRENT AT ALL. SO THAT'S THE ATTEMPT THANK YOU. FINISH RUBIO THANK YOU -- I HAD THE SAME CONCERN AND ONLY BECAUSE I CONSIDER MY A DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES THAT I REPRESENT AND I KNOW THAT -- SOMETIMES WHEN DONE IT'S A TWO YEAR FEE WOULD BE MUCH LARGER AND SOME FOLKS MAY THINK THEY CAN. AFFORD TO PAY TWO YEARS AND SOMETHING APPENS I KNOW THAT THE FEES AND FINES CAN BE VERY STEEP AND I WOULD RATHER NOT PUT THEM IN THAT KIND OF SITUATION BUT I LIKE THE ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO ASK FOR THE ONE OP TENANTS AND THAT WOULD SCATTER -- ACTUALLY THE REGISTRATIONS AND PERHAPS HELP BUT DEFINITELY IT'S A PROBLEM WE NEED TO ADDRESS COMPLETELY ON BOARD AND DOCILE THANK YOU FOR ADDRESSING THE OPT IN. OPTION -- AND DOUBT. ANOTHER -- NOT CONCERN BUT I WANT TO SEE IF YOU CAN SHOW A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THIS I KNOW THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS THE DMV STRIKE FORCES AND DO WE KNOW WHEN THAT IS GOING. TO COME TO FRUITION AND WHEN WE EXPECT TO HAVE THAT INFORMATION AND IS THAT GONNA SHOW A LITTLE BIT OF WHAT YOU DO HERE. WELL -- WE HOPE TO HAVE IT -- IN AT LEAST THIRTY DAYS BEFORE WE START REAL SERVICE BUDGET DELIBERATIONS AND MY HOPE IS THAT. WE GET IT BEFORE WE HAVE TO CONSIDER THE TWO HUNDRED BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET REQUESTS THAT THEY'VE MADE OF ME THERE. AN ANNOUNCEMENT ON NOT SO -- WE HOPE TO LOOK AT WAYS OF SAVING MONEY AS WELL AS SPENDING MONEY OBVIOUSLY -- OUT OF SHEER ISSUE ABOUT -- SOMEBODY -- IN TERMS OF AFFORDABILITY. THERE'S A REASON WHY IF WE GO WITH THE GOVERNOR'S CREDIT CARD IDEA WE CAN. HAVE PEOPLE PAY THE MONTHLY. NO THAT'S THERE'S OTHER CONCEPTS THAT ARE OUT THERE THAT. YOU KNOW MAKE IT JUST MORE CONVENIENT -- FOR PEOPLE VARIOUS OPTIONS I THINK. I THINK WE OUGHT TO LOOK AT THE FEASIBILITY OF ALL THAT KIND OF STUFF AND I HOPE TO DO THAT BY -- HAVING THIS BILL GO THROUGH IN. WORKING WITH MY COMMITTEE BECAUSE I THINK WHICH IS NOT GOING AWAY OUR COMMITTEE IS GOING TO BE DOING WITH THE DMV. THE SONG AS WE EXIST SO. THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THAT. COMMENT. THANK YOU AND CENTER SKINNER. THANK YOU. ARM. I THINK THIS COULD WORK VERY WELL FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE BUT I THINK THAT. ONE OF THE BIGGEST COMPLAINTS NOT THINK THIS IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST COMPLAINT SO I GET -- BEYOND THE WAIT TIMES IS THE FACT THAT. THE REGISTRATION BILL SHOWS UP AND YOU HAVE TO PAY IT ALL AT ONCE AND FOR MANY PEOPLE THEY DON'T HAVE THAT. AVAILABLE CASH -- IN WHEN IN THE SAY TO ME WELL THERE INSURANCE THEY CAN PAY MONTHLY. THERE EVEN YOUR TAXES OR CAN BE PAID OVERTIME. YOUR EVER ALMOST EVERY OTHER BIG EXPENSE YOU HAVE THE CAPABILITY TO PAY OVERTIME. BUT HERE'S THIS -- ONE EXPENSE THAT ALMOST EVERY CALIFORNIAN FACES THAT WE HAVE SET UP TO BE PAID AT ONCE SO WHEN WE SEE PEOPLE THAT DON'T REGISTER THEIR CARS IT'S OFTEN BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T PAY IT ONCE -- NOW YOU MENTIONED CENTER BUILD THE GOVERNOR'S YOU KNOW OUR CREDIT CARD THING BUT I WONDERED IF. YOU WOULD BE WILLING TO BUILD INTO THIS BILL. THAT A TWO YEAR REGISTRATION WOULD BE ABLE TO BE PAID IN INSTALLMENTS THAT WAY REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THIS CREDIT CARD THING HAPPENS OR NOT AT LEAST WE WOULD HAVE A PROVISION. FOR THESE -- FOR MONTHLY OR OTHER PAYMENTS. BECAUSE THEN IT WOULD BE CREATES LESS OF A HARDSHIP FOR FOR AYE AYE I'M WILLING TO LOOK AT ALL THOSE IDEAS -- AND I THINK THEY ARE MY BILL IS SIMPLY TO HAVE THEM EXPLORE THE SUB RIGHT SO YES -- AND LET'S PUT THAT IN. ABSOLUTELY I THINK THE CREDIT CARD IDEA OF JUST PUTTING ON YOUR CREDIT CARD -- DOES IT BECAUSE IT MINISTRY TO HOUSES FOR DMV I DON'T KNOW LET'S FIND OUT RIGHT -- LET'S SEE HOW WE CAN GO ABOUT DOING IT WITHOUT -- IMPEDING DMV. FOR DOING THEIR JOB I THINK. I THINK TO ALL THOSE IDEAS ARE GOOD THERE'S OTHER IDEAS -- PEOPLE HAVE LIKE. WHEN YOU DO YOUR -- SMOG CHECK YOU CAN PAY YOUR DMV FEES AT THE SAME TIME LIKE IN ABOUT -- THE THE WALK AND YOU DRIVE A CAR IN A SMOG CHECK STATION. AND THEN YOU GET YOUR SMOG CHECK YOU GET THE CERTIFICATION. IN NEVADA AND THEN THE GUY SAYS SO YOU WANT TO PAY YOUR DMV SIR. THANKS AND YOU MIGHT SAY YEAH COURSE IN AND SO HE ADDS IT TO THE SMOG CHECK BILL GOES ON A CREDIT CARD. SO THAT'S YOU KNOW THAT'S KIND OF THOSE KIND OF IDEAS -- I THINK ALL THAT KIND OF STUFF IS SOMETHING WE SHOULD LOOK AT IT THERE'S OTHER AYE AYE THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING IN OTHER STATES -- I KNOW THAT WE ARE LIMITED BY OUR TECHNOLOGY A DMV. WE CERTAINLY THAT HAVE A LOT OF ARM SO WE'RE TRYING TO DEAL WITH THAT OR COME THAT ISSUE IF WE WERE ALLOWING FOR PAYMENT OVER TIME CERTAINLY THE DMV COULD ALLOW ANOTHER ONE OF OUR STATE AGENCIES THAT ARE ALREADY SET UP. FOR SUCH PAYMENTS TO ADMINISTER THAT PAYMENT BUT WHAT I THINK WHAT ONE OF OUR OBJECTIVES IS IS TO HAVE. THE DMV BEAM A MUCH MORE CONSUMER FRIENDLY ANTI. THOUGH THIS IS A HOLLOW ALL THEIR IDEAS A COMMITTEES TALK ABOUT THESE ARE ALL I DO IS I WANT TO SEE HAPPEN I'M AND I'M PUTS THOSE EXPLORE EVERYTHING. WE SHOULD BE BROADENED OUR EXPLORATION -- SO. BUT MY POINT IS LET'S LOOK AT ALL THIS STUFF AND HAVE DIEM BE COME UP WITH SOME EFFICIENCIES AND COST SAVINGS AND WAYS TO MAKE IT MORE CONVENIENT FOR THE CONSUMER RATHER AND STANDING IN LINE OR YOU KNOW ALL THAT KIND OF STUFF SO I THINK -- IF YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE LOOKING AT IT THE RIGHT WAY I THINK WITH THIS BILL. THANK YOU FOR YOUR NO OTHER COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS WE DO HAVE A MOTION FROM NOT SENATOR STONE. SECRETARY MAY CALL THE ROLL.
