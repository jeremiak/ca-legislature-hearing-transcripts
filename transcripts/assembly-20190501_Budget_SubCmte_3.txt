AND AS THE DIRECTOR WAS NOT ABLE TO BE HERE ALONG WITH STAFF BECAUSE UNFORTUNATELY THEY WERE -- ATTENDING THE FUNERAL FOR UP A RETIRED REGIONAL CHIEF STAND CRACK -- CRAIG AND I WANT TO AGAIN OFFER -- THE COMMITTEES THE SUBCOMMITTEE'S CONDOLENCES TO THE DEPARTMENT ON THE LOSS OF FOR A SOMEONE WHO I UNDERSTAND WAS A VERY VALUED. MEMBER OF THE TEAM. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN BLOOM AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AT THIS YEAH. STAND WAS A BIG LOSS FOR US HE'D BEEN RETIRED FOR SEVERAL YEARS BUT HE HE KIND OF CAME BACK AND HELPED US IN SOME DIFFICULT TIMES OUT OF RETIREMENT SOME THANK YOU. FOR RECOGNIZING HIM OF COURSE -- FOR THIS MORNING -- WE WE HAVE -- THAT THE FIRST ITEM OF ISSUE NUMBER ONE ISSUE CONSERVE A BEIJING CAM -- REPLACEMENT KITCHEN -- IS A REQUEST FOR A FIVE POINT -- THREE TWO EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS OF GENERAL FUND -- TO FOR THE CONSTRUCTION PHASE COSTS OF REPLACING THE KITCHEN AND DINING FACILITY AT THE CAMP. IN TO HIM A COUNTY -- THIS CAMP IS A HUNDRED A MEMBER CAMP -- AND SERVICES -- EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND ACRES OF OF FOR SR RAY. A DOING FUELS RELATED PROJECTS AND WORKING -- ON TREE MORTALITY ISSUES -- IT WAS BUILT IN -- NINETEEN FIFTY NINE THE CAMP'S KITCHEN AND DINING FACILITY WAS DESTROYED IN A FIRE IN JULY OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AND UNFORTUNATELY -- IT WAS A COMPLETE LOSS -- IN THE INTERIM -- IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS IN ORDER TO KEEP THE CAMP OPEN AND WORKING WE UTILIZED OUR MOBILE KITCHEN UNIT THE ON SITE. AND TENTS -- AND THAT HAS BEEN IN IMPACTS TO THE ABILITIES OF THE CAMP -- TO HOUSE ADDITIONAL CREWS AND INMATES WERE -- THAT ARE ON THOSE CREWS WHEN WE HAVE A LARGE -- FIRES IN THE AREA OR WE'RE TRYING TO STAGE RESOURCES -- AT THAT CAMP -- SO THAT THAT FACILITY HAS BEEN -- IMPACTED IN THAT WAY -- WE HAVE MOVED THE FEEDING -- NOW AND FACILITY KITCHEN FACILITIES TO SOME OF THE OTHER -- BUILDINGS AND ARE MAKING IT MAKING DO -- BUT IT IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO KEEP THE CAMP RUNNING AS WE EED -- TO ON A LONG TERM BASIS. THE THIS FUNDING WILL HELP US GET BACK TO A NORMAL OPERATION AND BE ABLE TO SERVICE ALL OF THE FUELS READ IT LATER PROJECT WORK -- IN TO HIM A COUNTY AND BEYOND AND THEN THE FIRE MISSION AS WELL. AS THE TREE MORTALITY REMOVAL THE NEEDS TO CONTINUE. THAT'S WHAT WE GOT. THANK YOU -- IS THERE ANY -- LA -- REPORT SELECT SERVICE JUST COMPUTERS WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND SO YOU ARE HEARD A REQUEST RELATED TO THIS PROJECT I AM ALREADY EARLIER THIS YEAR SO IN THE JANUARY BUDGET PROPOSAL. ON THE BUDGET INCLUDED A LITTLE OVER FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE CONSTRUCTION PHASE OF THAT YOU SHE KITCHEN PROJECT -- WITHIN THAT THREE OR FOUR MONTHS SINCE THEN -- CAL FIRE HAS LEARNED OTHER PRETTY SIGNIFICANT COST INCREASE ON THAT CHIP RELEASE THAT IS BASED ON THE CHANGE IN THE SCOPE OF THE CONSTRUCTION PROJECT. THAT IS ESSENTIALLY ABOUT DOUBLING THE CONSTRUCTION COST FROM WHAT YOU HEARD JUST A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO -- THAT TYPICALLY WHEN AT APARTMENT WELL BE FACED WITH A CHANGE IN SCOPE OR SOMETHING VERY UNEXPECTED ESPECIALLY OF THIS MAGNITUDE. AND THEY WILL OFTEN GO BACK AND LOOK FOR WAYS TO MITIGATE THOSE COSTS AND ENSURE THAT THE KALEIDOSCOPE CHANGES REALLY FULLY NECESSARY. AND AND LOOK FOR MAYBE OTHER VALUE ENGINEERING OR THINGS TO TO BRING THE COST DOWN BEFORE THEY COME FORWARD. GIVEN THE TIMING OF WHEN CAL FIRE AT LEARNED ABOUT THE ISSUES THAT HAVE RESULTED IN THIS REQUEST. AND THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE TIME TO GO THROUGH AND DO THAT TYPE OF BACK AND FORTH I'M ON THE PROJECT TO TRY TO MITIGATE THE COST INCREASE. I AND SO BECAUSE OF THAT WE WOULD RECOMMEND APPROVING AT THAT FUNDING AND IN JANUARY AND THE APRIL INCREASE FOR THE PROJECT. BY ADDING BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE -- TO ONLY ALLOW CAL FIRE TO ACCESS THIS PIECE OF THE FUNDING -- AFTER THEY HAVE COMPLETED THAT WORK OF GOING BACK AND LOOKING AT AND HOW THEY CAN POTENTIALLY MITIGATE THE COST INCREASE ON THAT I KNOW THAT SOMETHING TO MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THEY ARE CURRENTLY WORKING ON AND THEY JUST HAVEN'T HAD THE TIME GIVEN THE TIMING OF WHEN THEY LEARNED ABOUT. THE COST INCREASE SO FOR EXAMPLE AND THE MAJORITY OF THIS COST INCREASES RELATED TO A VERY LARGE WATER TANK. THAT WILL HAVE TO HE ADDED TO THE PROJECT ON AND SO THE SIZE OF THAT WATER TANK IS SOMEONE IN QUESTION BECAUSE THERE'S OTHER FIREFIGHTING RESOURCES THAT THEY HAVE AVAILABLE AT THIS CAMP THERE IS A FIRE TRUCK AND THAT'S ON SITE AND A FIRE STATION THAT IS NEARBY. AND SO AS THEY TAKE THOSE THINGS INTO CONSIDERATION THAT COULD HELP OFFSET SOME OF THAT THE SCOPE CHANGE THAT IS INCLUDED HERE AND THIS IS SORT OF THE FULL MAGNITUDE OF IT. AND SO IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT THEY CONTINUE THESE EFFORTS TO REALLY TRY TO GET THE COST BACK DOWN WE WOULD RECOMMEND ADDING THAT PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE. THANK YOU DOES -- DEPARTMENT FANS HAVE ANY COMMENTS ENTER SHARP FOR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I JUST WANTED TO COMMENT THAT THE STANDARD CAPITAL A PROCESS IS AS WE GO THROUGH. THE WORKING DRAWINGS AND DESIGN IF WE DO FIND EFFICIENCIES -- THOSE FUNDS FOR THE CAPITAL PROJECT TO REVERT BACK TO THE FINE FOR WHICH THEY WERE ORIGINATED IN WE WOULD COMMIT TO DOING THAT AB IF WE FOUND EFFICIENCIES TO REVERT. THE FUNDS BACK THAT IS STANDARD PRACTICE. HOWEVER -- I DID WANT TO SAY YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN IN CLOSE COMMUNICATION WITH LA -- AND IF IT'S A LEGISLATORS LEGISLATIVE PURVIEW TO ADD BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE I THINK THAT WE COULD WORK ON SOMETHING SO -- IT'S NOT A PREFERENCE BUT I THINK WE COULD WORK ON SOMETHING IF NECESSARY -- OKAY. THE QUESTIONS SIR COMMENTS ON THIS ITEM. PLEASE THIS RACE. SO IT IS I UNDERSTAND THAT IF WE DO REQUEST PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE THEN -- THE THE MINISTRATION AND PUBLIC FINANCE IN LA -- WOULD WORK ON THE LANGUAGE. YES I I THINK THAT'S ACCEPTABLE PER CONVERSATIONS I THINK WE COULD WORK ON SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T HAMPER THE PROJECT IF THE LEGISLATIVE LEGISLATURE FELT THAT WAS NECESSARY WONDERFUL THANK YOU. IF I COULD SUMMARIZE LA -- THINKS WE SHOULD DO PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AS WE'RE GONNA DO THAT ANYWAY IT'S REALLY NOT NECESSARY BUT WE COULD DO IT -- I THINK MY PREFERENCE -- IS ALWAYS TO HAVE SOME YOU KNOW BELTS AND SUSPENDERS. BUILT INTO THE PROCESS -- AND I THINK EVERYBODY'S MORE LESS ON THE SAME PAGE I PREFER TO HAVE THE PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE HI THERE -- BUT CERTAINLY DOESN'T HURT -- SO DO WE NEED -- TO CAN WE CAN WE APPROVE IT. TO THIS BUDGET WITH PROVISIONAL. OKAY -- SO WHEN WE GET TO MOTIONS -- I THINK. I WILL DO PUBLIC COMMENT -- AFTER ISSUE THREE AND THEN WE'LL JUST TO A SERIES OF WELL TO BE TO MOTIONS BECAUSE NUMBER THREE IS -- IS A HOLD OPEN. HI BUT WILL -- ASK FOR THAT -- WITH THE PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE ISSUE. TWO VERY GOOD. ISSUE. TWO CALPERS REQUESTING SEVEN POINT THREE FOUR THREE MILLION. DOLLARS AND RELEASED REVENUE IN LEASE REVENUE BONDS -- FOR ADDITIONAL -- COSTS FOR CONSTRUCTION OF A CONSTRUCTION FUNDING RELATED TO THE SAN MATTEO SANTA CRUZ -- AUTO SHOP -- AND THAT -- CONSTRUCTION PHASE COST IT WAS UNFORTUNATELY -- ANOTHER ONE OF THESE -- AS WE LOOKED AT IT FURTHER -- AND THE AT AND AND AND ANALYZED THE COSTS GOING FORWARD -- THE THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE -- DUE -- TO THE AREA OF WHICH THIS IS IS HAPPENING IN SANTA CRUZ COUNTY -- CONSTRUCTION COSTS ARE MORE THAN WHEN THIS WAS FIRST SCOPED -- THE SOME OF THE ITEMS THAT ARE ATTACHED TO THIS INCLUDING THE FIRE SYSTEM -- WATER -- TANK -- ARE ALSO INCREASING IN COSTS. THE MATERIALS -- AS THIS WAS SCOPE A LONG TIME BACK -- AND THE ANTICIPATED COST OF THOSE HAVE INCREASED AS WELL AS THE CONSTRUCTION CONTINGENCY THAT'S ATTACHED TO ALL OF THAT. AND IN CONCLUSION THAT'S ISSUE. TWO THANK YOU MISS PETERS SENDING COMMENTS. SO WE DON'T HAVE ANY SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS ON THIS ONE BUT JUST WANT TO POINT OUT THIS IS A VERY SIGNIFICANT COST INCREASE -- FROM WHAT THE PROJECT WAS ESTIMATED TO BE WHEN IT WENT OUT TO BED AND THEN THE BIDS COMING BACK ON THE PROJECT ALL OF THEM. ON THE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THE LOWEST ONE WAS AND IT'S ABOUT SIXTY SEVEN CLOSE 270% ABOVE WHAT THE ESTIMATE WISE AND SO FOR US AND THERE'S THERE'S NOT A WHOLE LOT AT THIS POINT GIVEN THE STAGE THE PROJECT IS THEN. AND THAT WE THINK YOU CAN REALLY DO ON THIS PROJECT SHORT OF YOU KNOW MAYBE DECIDING TO NOT GO FORWARD WITH IT WHICH WERE NOT RECOMMENDING BUT IT DOES RAISE SOME GOOD OVERSIGHT QUESTIONS AND ISSUES FOR YOU IN TERMS OF HOW CAL FIRE IS WORKING. WITH THE D. G. S. ON MANAGING ITS PROJECTS -- OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THAT PART OF THE GENESIS FOR THIS ISSUE IS THAT TIME CAL FIRE INDEED YES HAD TAKEN THE PLANS FROM ANOTHER SIMILAR PROJECT. AND TAKE IN THE ESTIMATE FROM THAT PROJECT AND DECIDED OKAY WE'RE GONNA JUST REUSE THOSE SAME PLANS AND THEY RE USE THAT SAME ESTIMATE AND IT SOUNDS LIKE PERHAPS THAT ESTIMATE. THE ORIGINAL ONE THAT THEY USED MAYBE HAD SOME ISSUES WITH IT AND THAT PROJECT HAD HAD SOME COST INCREASES AND SO. SEEMS LIKE THERE MIGHT NOT BE THAT SYSTEMS IN PLACE INTERNALLY AND HOW GOING BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN CAO FIRING TGS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE ESTIMATES THAT THEY'RE USING ESPECIALLY IF THEY'RE TRYING TO TAKE THE PLANTS FROM ANOTHER PROJECT. HAVE BEEN FULLY UPDATED TO ACCOUNT FOR OTHER CHANGES OR TO ACCOUNT FOR THE FACT THAT MAYBE THAT ORIGINAL ESTIMATE HAD SOME ISSUES WITH THE IN THE FIRST PLACE AND SO WE THINK IT JUST RAISES SOME OVERSIGHT QUESTIONS. I'M NOW IN IN THE FUTURE ABOUT HOW THESE PROJECTS ARE BEING MANAGING HOW THE ESTIMATES ARE BEING DEVELOPED. ON BETWEEN HOW FIRE AND TGS SO -- DOES DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ONE OF REFLECT ON ON THAT PARTICULAR ISSUE. GET ME UNDER SHARPER FINANCE -- I JUST WANNA SAY WE ARE ON THE CAPITAL OUTLAY SIDE AND YOUR COMMITTEE HAS HEARD SEVERAL ISSUES TO WHERE WE ARE FINDING COST INCREASES WITH MATERIALS AND LABOR -- IT'S IN NATURE OF HAVING A GOOD ECONOMY WHICH IS GOOD AND IN ONE WAY BUT NOT SO GOOD. FOR áP COSTS. SO -- WE DEFINITELY HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT PROJECTS AND IT MAY I AM WE'LL BE TALKING INTERNALLY ABOUT SOME STRATEGIES WE WANT TO DO EVEN GOING INTO NEXT YEAR'S BUDGET AS TO WHETHER WE WANT TO DO COST UPDATES -- ON A GRAND SCALE FOR SOME OF OUR OLDER PROJECTS WE GET A LOT OF EFFICIENCIES WHEN WE USE DESIGNS FOR PROJECTS EXPRESSLY WHEN THEY'RE ALMOST SIMILAR YOU KNOW WE CAN SAVE A LOT OF MONEY BUT WEAR THAT. AND IT DOES THE THE PITFALL IS FOR THINGS THAT WE CAN'T REALLY ACCOUNT FOR AND THAT'S THE ECONOMY AND MATERIALS SO WE'RE THINKING ABOUT -- DOING SOME DEEPER ANALYSIS INTO THAT AND WHETHER WILL -- UPDATE PROJECTS ON A LARGER SCALE IT'S DEFINITELY SOMETHING I'LL BE LOOKING OUT OF MY AREA. BUT I I THINK FOR THIS PROJECT THERE'S WE NEED TO MOVE FORWARD. THE DIRECTOR PORTER YOUR KIND OF TAKING A FRESH LOOK AT THIS BECAUSE ALL THIS PROCEEDED -- TO YOUR TO YOUR TIME IS TO AS DIRECTOR -- DO YOU SEE ANY PLACES -- WHERE YOU WOULD DO THINGS DIFFERENTLY OR THERE'S LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE -- FROM THE PROCESS HERE -- YES IN ON SCOPE I AM I'M GONNA I'M GONNA GIVE YOU A BRIDGE A MINUTE TAKE A BRIDGE -- AND INTRODUCE -- MIKE DUGGAN WHO'S BEEN BEFORE YOU BEFORE -- THESE ARE -- DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF TECH SERVICES AND HE'S ACTUALLY GONNA PROVIDES SOME OF THAT BACKGROUND THANK YOU WELCOME. THANK YOU -- THE ESTIMATE THAT -- THE LA WOULD MENTION WAS AN AUTO SHOP THAT WAS JUST COMPLETED IN DECEMBER -- TWENTY EIGHTEEN VERY SIMILAR IN IN FUNCTION AND ACTUAL FOOTPRINTS SO -- THAT PROJECT HAD OVER A BIT QUITE A BIT -- AS FAR AS OUR EFFORTS IN THE FUTURE -- DID YES DID. LET US KNOW THAT THEY THOUGHT THERE WAS GOING TO BE A BUDGET DEFICIT ON THIS FLIGHT. TO THIS SCALE WE DID NOT KNOW SO THIS WAS -- I'D BIG AYE OPENER IN OUR DISCUSSIONS WITH FINANCE IN THE LA L. -- HAVE BRIGHT TO REALLY TO THE FOREFRONT OF THAT WE NEED TO DO THIS WORK GOES TO BED AND BE MUCH MORE AWARE WHAT WE'RE FACING -- GOING FORWARD I THINK OF LOOKING AT IT. WE TRY TO DO OUR BEST AS FAR AS LOOKING THAT ARE THERE ARE OTHER ESTIMATED IN WITH THAT PROJECT ENDED UP AT AT ITS CLOSE. AND ROUGHLY HOW MUCH IT HAD GONE OVER FROM THE ORIGINAL ESTIMATE -- I THINK THE ITEMS THAT WE DIDN'T TAKE INTO SERIOUS ACCOUNT WAS THE LOCATION. OF BEDLAM IN CAMP WHERE THIS AUTO SHOPS GOING WHICH IS AN NARROW ROAD SO -- TRANSPORTATION MATERIALS -- WAS BASICALLY DOUBLED -- THAT WAS TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IN THE ESTIMATE SO I THINK IT'S FROM TALKING I PRIMARILY THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I WANNA HAVE A SIT DOWN WITH TGS BEFORE THESE GO TO BED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GOT OUR ALL REVENUES COVERED. QUITE HONESTLY Là BARRISTAN THIS. ONE OKAY WELL -- AS LONG AS ALL THAT -- EMBARRASSMENT OR WHATEVER A ONE WANTS TO CALL IT -- IS CHANNELED INTO A POSITIVE PLACE THEN WILL END UP IN A GOOD PLACE IT SOUNDS LIKE THIS PROJECT WAS DESTINED TO COST. MORE THAN IT WAS ORIGINALLY PROJECTED -- FOR IT'S NOT A COST OVERRUN IN THE SENSE THAT -- YOU KNOW TRADITIONALLY WEAK -- WOULD REALLY HAVE CONCERNS STRUCTURALLY -- ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON BUT IT IT IT IT. ALSO LIKE THE THE TROUBLING PART OF IT IS IT SOUNDS LIKE. THERE WERE -- THERE WAS AN ASSUMPTION THAT BECAUSE AN AUTO SHOP COSTS X. AMOUNT OF DOLLARS IN ONE PLACE IT'LL COST ABOUT THE SAME THING IN ANOTHER PLACE AND TAT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE A VERY. EFFECTIVE WAY TO ANALYZE PROJECTS. MR FUNG HAS A QUESTION. JUST A QUICK QUESTION -- FOR FIDELIO. IN TERMS OF OVERSIGHT. AND THE ANALYSIS YOU'VE DONE FOR OTHER AGENCIES IS THIS AN ANOMALY OR DO YOU DO DO YOU SEE A PATTERN OF OF OF CONCERNED WITH D. G. S. N.. AND THE THE PLANNING AND THAT AND THE COST ESTIMATES I AM I WOULD HAVE TO HAVE AND OUR STAFF WHO WORKS ON TGS GET BACK TO YOU I'M NOT. AWARE I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WAS DRIVING SOME OF THE CONCERN IS THAT YOU IN IN TERMS OF THE APRIL REQUEST THAT YOU HAVE BEFORE YOU THAT YOU HAD TO PROJECTS WITH REALLY SIGNIFICANT COST INCREASES. WE LOOKED INTO IT WAS FOR DIFFERENT REASONS -- YOU KNOW ONE THE THE ISSUE PROJECT THAT YOU HEARD ALREADY -- IS MORE OF A SCOPE CHANGE THIS ONE IS MORE OF I THINK JUST ENSURING THAT THE DEPARTMENTS HAVE THE EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION AND PROCESS IN PLACE. TO WEAR THEIR ESTIMATES ARE AND YOU KNOW OUR MORE REASONABLE IT'S IT'S YOU KNOW IN THIS CASE IT WENT SO FAR OVER THAT THEY WERE NOT. ABLE TO OVER THE PROJECT AND GO FORWARD AS PLANNED -- BUT WE CAN GET BACK TO YOU IF THERE'S OTHER MORE BROAD CONCERNS. THANK YOU. I AND I I WOULD SAY IF THERE ARE BROAD CONCERNS IF THE IF IF THERE AREN'T THAN JUST REPORT BACK TO US IF THERE ARE THAN WE SHOULD CONSIDER -- ADDRESSING THAT PUBLICLY -- IN A IN A IN A FUTURE HEARING. A BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE AN INDICATION THAT THERE'S MORE ENDEMIC ISSUES THAT THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED. SORRY DIDN'T MEAN TO INTERRUPT BUT PLEASE JUST A SCORES ARE -- OUR INTERACTION WITH THE G. AS THIS WAS AN ANOMALY -- ALSO LEARNING EXPERIENCE FOR OUR PROJECTS GOING FORWARD WE DON'T WANT. TO COME BACK TO YOU IN THE SAME LIGHT. APPRECIATE THAT AND AND I EXPECT THAT THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO HEAR BACK AND CERTAINLY HOPE THAT THAT'S WHAT WE ARE BACK. THANK YOU FOR THE ADDITIONAL COMMENTS -- IF THERE'S NO ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS WHEN WE MOVE ON TO ISSUE THREE WHICH THE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR WHICH THE RECOMMENDATIONS HOLD OPEN AND THEN WE'LL TAKE. PUBLIC COMMENT. I THANK JUDY ONE NUMBER. THREE SO AGAIN TOM PORTER -- AND ISSUE NUMBER. THREE A WILDFIRE PREVENTION AND RECOVERY -- B. C.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT MAY ONLY BE -- AUTHORIZATION FOR ONE POSITION BUT IT'S NICE TO SEE THIS PROJECT MOVED INCH BY INCH PERHAPS DROP BY DROP -- OF FORWARD IT -- ONE DAY IS GOING TO BE A REGIONAL RESOURCE THAT -- I I THINK IT'S GONNA SERVE THE PUBLIC WELL. OUR LAST ITEM TODAY IS AN INFORMATION ITEM. WE WILL BE TAKING A VOTE ON IT BUT THIS -- INFORMATIONAL ITEM AS A RESULT OF DISCUSSION DURING THEIR CAP AND TRADE HEARING THAT WE HELD A FEW WEEKS AGO AND AT THAT HEARING I ASKED. WHY MANY OF THE CATEGORIES RELATING TO NATURAL AND WORKING LANDS OF HAD NOT BEEN PROPOSED FOR FUNDING BY THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE RESPONSE? FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WAS THAT SOME OF THESE CATEGORIES STILL HAVE FUNDS LEFT OVER AND OTHERS HAVE OTHER SOURCES OF FUNDING AND THE CONCERN EXPRESSED AT THAT TIME IS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION MAY BE FEELING PROP SIXTY EIGHT AS A WAY. TO SUPPLANT CURRENT SOURCES OF FUNDING AND I WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT -- OF VOTERS WHO VOTED FOR PROP SIXTY EIGHT OF THOSE WHO DID SO DID SO BELIEVING THAT THESE PROGRAMS ARE UNDERFUNDED. AND PROP SIXTY IT WAS MEANT TO BE ADDITIVE AND NOT REPLACE pWORD OR GENERAL FUND OF AND IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT VOTERS WOULD NOT HAVE VOTED FOR THIS IF THEY THOUGHT THAT THEY WERE JUST REPLACING -- ONE FUND FOR ANOTHER ONE FUNDING SOURCE FOR ANOTHER. SO THE PURPOSE OF THIS INFORMATIONAL I AM TODAY IS FOR US TO GET. SOME CLARITY ON THE STATE OF THESE PROGRAMS -- NAMELY THEIR DEMAND CURRENT LEVELS OF FUNDING AND PROPOSED FUNDING AMOUNTS AND SOURCES. SHOULD STE ADD THAT WITH -- INCREASED WILDFIRE RISKS AND INCREASINGLY INTENSE WEATHER PATTERNS I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE ADEQUATELY FUNDING NATURAL AND WORKING LANDS AND THE INFORMATION -- ARE FROM THIS HEARING WILL BE -- IMMENSELY HELPFUL TO MYSELF AND OTHERS AS WE DELIBERATE. THE BUDGET PROCESS SO I'M SORRY FOR THE LONG WINDED IN INTRODUCTION BUT APPRECIATE YOUR BEING HERE AND SHOWING SOME ADDITIONAL LIGHT ON THIS ITEM AND OF COURSE WE'LL TAKE. PUBLIC COMMENT AFTER THE PRESENTATIONS ARE COMPLETE. GEN AND BRIAN CASH WITH THE NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY AND I'LL BE. SHARING TESTIMONY WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TODAY ON THIS -- I'LL BE GIVING THE STATUS OF THE PROGRAMS AND THE DEMAND FOR THE PROGRAMS -- OVERALL -- I CAN SAY THAT THE THE PROGRAM THERE'S A LOT OF DEMAND FOR THE PROGRAMS -- FOR BOTH THE CAP CAP AND TRADE PROGRAMS AND ALSO THE PROP -- SIXTY EIGHT SOME OF THE PROGRAMS HAVE IS AS MUCH AS FIVE TIMES THE ASK THAN. THE ACTUAL FUNDING THAT'S AVAILABLE FOR BOTH PROP THE GT R. F. AND PROP. SIXTY EIGHT THE PROGRAMS ARE ALL ROLLING FORWARD -- ALL OF THEM HAVE -- THAT HAVE FUNDING IN BOTH SIXTY EIGHT IN G. G. R. S. WILL BE AWARDING THE FUNDS WITHIN THIS CALENDAR YEAR. SO -- EVEN THOUGH THEY DO HAVE PROP SIXTY EIGHT AND G. R. L. FROM PREVIOUS YEARS THOSE ARE ALL GOING TO ALL THE FUNDS ARE GOING TO BE COMMITTED TO PROJECTS BY THE END OF THIS YEAR. SO THE THE PROGRAMS ARE ROLLING AND THE DEMAND IS IS PRETTY HIGH FOR THEM THE ONLY PROGRAM THAT DID NOT HAVE HIGH DEMAND WAS -- IN FISH AND WILDLIFE THEIR WEAPONS PROGRAM. IN THEIR WORK THEY'RE COMBINING THEIR MONEY FROM SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN AND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN TWO IN DOING AN OUTREACH -- DURING ADDITIONAL OUTRAGE TO ACTUALLY BRING IN MORE PEOPLE TO APPLY FOR THE PROGRAM SO THE ONE THAT DID NOT HAVE -- MORE DEMAND THAN SUPPLY IS ACTUALLY DOING SOMETHING TO GO OUT AND GET MORE APPLICANTS [inaudible] GREAT. CIRCLE AGAR DEPARTMENT FINANCE SO I DID JUST WANT TO CLARIFY -- THE GENERAL FUND CHART THAT WAS INCLUDED WITHIN THE AGENDA WHICH DOES REFERENCE EIGHTY FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR GENERAL FUND DECREASE AND THE NATURAL RESOURCES FUNDING. HOWEVER WE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW THAT THAT EIGHTEEN NINETEEN AMOUNT REFERENCED IN THE AGENDA IS THE REVISED EIGHTEEN NINETEEN AMOUNT WHICH INCLUDES THE INCREASED CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES COST -- IT ALSO INCLUDES A ONE TIME LEGISLATIVE INVESTMENTS THAT WERE APPROVED AND LAST YEAR'S BUDGET AS A ONE TIME BY THE LEGISLATURE AND ALSO INCLUDES SIGNIFICANT ONE TIME INVESTMENT THAT WAS MADE FOR THE CALIFORNIA INDIAN HERITAGE CENTER. SO ABSENT THE INCREASED CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES COST FOR EIGHTEEN NINETEEN AND ABSENT THE ONE TIME INVESTMENT THERE IS A GENERAL FUND INCREASE IN INVESTMENT IN THE NATURAL RESOURCES PROGRAM. WHICH WE WANT TO CLARIFY -- THAT NO ON ON THAT CHART. AND ALSO JUST TO PROVIDE A LITTLE BIT OF CONTEXT ON THE OVERALL BUDGET FRAMEWORK -- THE BUDGET DOES FOCUS ON RESILIENCY AT THE THING ABILITY AND WHILE THE STATE DOES CURRENTLY HAVE A STRONG FOUNDATION AND A HEALTHY BUDGET THERE IS CONTINUE TO GROWING RISK AND UNCERTAINTY -- AND WHILE WE ARE ASSUMING. MODERATE GROWTH OVER TO THE FORECAST PERIOD I EVEN A MATER RECESSION COULD HAVE SOME SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE STATE'S THE GENERAL FUND REVENUE SO MAINTAINING THE STATE'S FISCAL HEALTH AND AND THE STATE BUDGET. IS CRITICAL AND IT'S STILL ON ONGOING CHALLENGE GIVEN THE BALL TH&lt;c.cyan&gt; REVENUE BASE AND THE&lt;/c&gt; LIMITED -- SPENDING FLEXIBILITY AND YOU MAY RECALL IN THE LAST RECESSION THERE WAS SIGNIFICANT CUTS TO THE STATE PARKS AND OTHER RESOURCES PROGRAMS SO THE FOCUS ON BUDGET RESILIENCY AND BUDGETS THE THING ABILITY. MAY HELP US PRESERVE SOME OF THESE -- NATURAL RESOURCES PROGRAMS IF THE NEXT ECONOMIC DOWNTURN HAPPENS. WELL -- WHAT OTHER AREAS OF THE BUDGET ARE -- ARE ARE BEING CONSIDEREDTHE WAY THIS YEAR THE BUDGET AS I MEAN I TAKE YOUR POINT. THAT WE WANT -- TO PRESERVERS ALIENS IN THE BUDGET AND AND MAKE SURE THAT WERE -- BEING RESPONSIBLE CONSCIENTIOUS ABOUT THE POTENTIAL NEXT RECESSION -- BUT THIS LITTLE PIECE OF THE OF THE BUDGET SEEMS TO STAND OUT -- AND IT IN SO FAR AS THE A LACK OF FOR A OF OF FUNDING SO. IF THIS IS. A IS IS THE ONLY AREA THAT -- THIS BEING TREATED THAT WAY OR IS THERE SOME RHYME OR REASON AND OTHER AREAS -- THAT THE SAME LOGIC IS BEING APPLIED. SO IF THEY IF IF IF BUDGET FRAMEWORK APPLIES TO ALL AREAS -- AND LOOKING AT NATURAL RESOURCES OVER THE PAST TEN YEARS THERE HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANT ONGOING GENERAL FUND INCREASES FOR AND ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION AND NINE TEN TO NOW THREE POINT FIVE BILLION. AND THAT IN ADDITION TO THE BOND FUNDS WHICH ARE ULTIMATELY THAT SERVICE PAID BY THE GENERAL FUND IN ADDITION TO THE SPECIAL FUNDS SO. IF WE LOOK AT HISTORICAL GROWTH IN THIS AREA THEY HAVE BEEN CLIMBING OVER THE PAST TEN YEARS AGO THAT SO HAVE -- VIRTUALLY EVERY OTHER AREA OF THE BUDGET SO WHAT DISTINGUISHES THIS FROM ALL THOSE OTHER AREAS. I WILL BE. SURE TO READ THE COVER WITH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE -- I THINK. WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT THE CHART IN THE AGENDA AND TRYING TO LOOK AT LIKE THE YEAR OVER YEAR CHANGES I THINK THERE ARE A COUPLE OF UNUSUAL THINGS THAT MISTER AGUILAR IS REFERRING TO LIKE? THE THAT EMERGENCY RESPONSE MONEY THAT WAS IN HERE THE ONE TIME INVESTMENTS ARE NOT UNIQUE TO THIS AREA I THINK THERE'S BEEN A NUMBER OF AREAS OF HAD ONE TIME I'M THE LEGISLATIVE INVESTMENTS HAVE BEEN PART OF PRIOR BUDGETS. AND SO I THINK -- TRAINING OVERTIME IS. SERGIO MENTIONED IT HAS BEEN GROWING AND WE WANTED TO POINT OUT THAT KIND OF LOOKING AT THIS YEAR OVER YEAR. I AM AT WITH THE REVISED NUMBERS DOESN'T QUITE QUITE REFLECT ALL THE OTHER THINGS GOING ON IN THIS AREA. WITH THE THE BOND FUNDS WITH THE ONE TIME INVESTMENT WITH THE EMERGENCY FUNDING THAT WAS IN THE EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUDGET. DID YOU HAVE MORE THAT YOU WANT TO ADD TO THEM I'VE ALSO AND I ALSO WANTED TO JUMP IN THE MIDDLE NO NO NO THAT IS LIFE AND IF YOU WANT TO GO TO QUESTIONS AND ONE OF THE THINGS YEAH I WOULD. YOU SEE THE QUESTIONS THAT ARE IN THE AGENDA WE WOULD LIKE TO HEAR YOUR RESPONSES TO THE GREAT THANK YOU. AND ON THAT CAP AND TRADE EXPENDITURE PLANNED SO -- NOTING THAT I THINK GOING BACK TO AT MY EXPLAIN A LITTLE BIT OF THE CONSIDERATIONS THAT WENT INTO THE JANUARY TURN TEN VERSION OF THE CAP AND MAKE SENATOR KEVIN TRADE EXPENDITURE PLAN -- IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN WE HAD MORE REVENUES IN THE PLAN AND SO WE HAVE DROPPED FROM THE EIGHTEEN NINETEEN LEVELS TO ABOUT ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN THE TWENTY NINETEEN EXPENDITURE PLANET JANUARY. TEN CONSIDERATIONS THAT WERE -- TAKING INTO ACCOUNT INCLUDE YOU KNOW THE DECLINING REVENUE LEVELS -- THE GOALS OF MEETING THE REQUIRED 35% TARGETS FOR DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS LOOKING AT THE PROGRAMS THAT HAVE HISTORICALLY RECEIVE FUNDING ON AN ONGOING BASIS. AND ALSO -- LOOKING AND RESPONDING TO THE FEEDBACK THAT WAS PROVIDED AS PART. OF THE THIRD INVESTMENT PLAN FROM STAKEHOLDERS THE FOCUS ON THE LOOKING AT LOCAL NEEDS -- YOU KNOW. PART OF THE FUNDING GOING TO THAT TRANSFORMATIVE CLIMATE COMMUNITIES AND OTHER CONSIDERATIONS SUCH AS THOSE SO WE JUST WANTED TO GIVE A LITTLE BIT OF CONTEXT OF WHAT WENT INTO THE JANUARY. TEN PLANNING AS WELL AS THE DECLINING CAP AND TRADE REVENUES. THE QUESTION ALSO POSED IN THE AGENDA IS ASKING WHETHER WE ARE CONSIDERING RESTORATION AS PART OF THE MAYOR VISION AND I'M OBVIOUSLY NOT AT LIBERTY TO DISCUSS WHAT'S IN THE MAY REVISION BUT WE WILL HAVE -- AN UPDATED PLAN BECAUSE OF UPDATED REVENUES AS IS. TYPICALLY WHAT WE PROVIDE IT MAY REVISION. SO WHAT DO YOU THINK THE VOTERS WERE LOOKING FOR WHEN THEY PASSED PROP. SIXTY EIGHT SO ON I AND M.. I HAVE A AS USUAL I MEAN THE ADMINISTRATION. RIGHT AND IT SOUNDS LIKE THIS IS BEEN -- A TOPIC THAT'S BEEN AND COVER BEFORE AND DISCUSSED BEFORE US AS FAR AS WHERE TO INVEST AS PROP SIXTY EIGHT DOLLARS -- WANTED A NOTE THAT. THE EXISTENCE OF THE PROP SIXTY EIGHT DOLLARS ALONE DOESN'T. PRECLUDE ADDITIONAL JDRF SPENDING I THINK HEALTHY SOILS IS ONE AREA WHERE THEY HAD PROP SIXTY EIGHT FUNDING I BELIEVE IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN AND IS ACTUALLY EXPANDED UPON IN THE NINETEEN TWENTY BUDGET. SO IT'S NOT LIKE THIS OVER ARCHING RULE THAT IS APPLIED AS FAR AS WHAT'S THERE FOR PROP SIXTY EIGHT FUNDING. I AGREE WITH WHAT MR CASH PRESENTED AS FAR AS THEIR SCENES YOU KNOW TO BE QUITE A DEMAND FOR THE PROP SIXTY PROGRAMS AS WELL AS A CAP AND TRADE PROGRAMS AS WELL AS JUST THE GENERAL FUND. OVERALL AND SO I THINK TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION KIND OF ALL THE FUNDING SOURCES THAT COME INTO PLAY IN THIS AREA IT IS -- ONE THAT INVOLVES ALL OF YOU KNOW LOOKING AT ALL THE NEEDS AND THEN PRIORITIZING BASED ON WHAT REVENUES ARE AVAILABLE AND FOR WHAT PURPOSES CHAU -- I WANNA MAKE SURE I UNDERSTAND THE THE ADMINISTRATION'S VIEW ON THIS DOES THE ADMINISTRATION VIEW -- PROXY PROP SIXTY EIGHT AS A FUNDING SOURCE THAT SUB THAT WOULD BE SUPPLEMENTAL -- TO THESE PROGRAMS OR THAT WOULD SUPPLANT THE I THINK OUR VIEW IS WE HAVE TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT. ALL THE FUNDING STREAMS KIND OF AS I PREVIOUSLY NOTED SO WE HAVE PROP SIXTY EIGHT FUNDED PROGRAMS -- GENERAL FUND FUNDED PROGRAMS CAP AND TRADE FUNDING PROGRAMS AND JUST TAKING A LOOK AT ALL OF THOSE [inaudible] RIGHT I'M. NOT SATISFIED WITH THAT RESPONSE -- ARE THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. THEN WHY DON'T WE I TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY NOW TO HEAR FROM -- THOSE WHO MAY WANT TO SPEAK TO THIS ISSUE FROM THE PUBLIC. GOOD MORNING MR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE OF FEDERAL KNOWN BEHALF OF VINYL TO SPENT. SKEWS ME. WE HAVE A FINAL DEFENCE FUND -- WE'VE BEEN REALLY ENCOURAGED BY THE DISCUSSION THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS ENGAGED IN ON BOTH THE GREENHOUSE GAS PRODUCTION FUND -- PRIORITIZATION FOR NATIONAL WRITTEN PLANS AS WELL AS THAT OF THE BROADER DISCUSSION ABOUT ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS FROM GENERAL FUND. AGREED THAT AND YOU KNOW THERE WERE A LOT OF ONE TIME INVESTMENTS AND SO HOPEFULLY THAT OPENS THE DOOR FOR ADDITIONAL -- CONSIDERATION OF ONE TIME INVESTMENTS IN NETWORKING LINES EVEN FROM THE GENERAL FUND IN ADDITION TO WHAT'S BEING DISCUSSED -- ESPECIALLY ENCOURAGED BY THE FACT THAT WE HAVE A JOINT LETTER OF ASSEMBLY MEMBERS AND SENATORS THAT SIGNED ON EARLY ON IN THE YEAR -- PRIORITIZING THE FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS -- OF ADDITIONAL RESOURCES FROM THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND -- AND NOW WHAT'S BEING SHARED IS A SIGN ON LETTER WITH OVER NINETY DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS FROM THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA -- REALLY EXPRESSING -- INCREASE SUPPORT FOR THAT PROPOSAL AS WELL AS BEGINNING TO TO LOOK AT HOW THAT THOSE FUNDING -- AMOUNTS COULD ACTUALLY BE BROKEN UP UP BY THE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS THAT ARE BEING DISCUSSED -- THE LAST THING I WOULD ADD TO IS -- YOU KNOW REALLY ENCOURAGED TO HEAR THAT IT SOUNDS LIKE THE DEPARTMENTS WOULD BE ABLE TO METABOLIZE ADDITIONAL FUNDS TO SHOULD BE MADE AVAILABLE -- IN PARTICULAR LOOKING AT A LOT OF THE UPCOMING ISSUES THAT WE ARE OUR STATE IS GONNA BE FACING WHETHER IT'S COASTAL OR INLAND COMMUNITIES. RURAL URBAN COMMUNITIES ON THE TYPES OF PROGRAMS THAT ARE BEING OUTLINED IN THIS LETTER -- BENEFITS ALL CALIFORNIA -- WHETHER YOU TALK ABOUT SEA LEVEL RISE URBAN HEAT ISLAND EFFECT IN URBAN COMMUNITIES IN THE WAYS IN WHICH URBAN GREETING IN URBAN FORESTRY CAN CAN HELP WITH THAT -- DEALING WITH COASTAL ADAPTATION DEALING WITH FOREST HEALTH MANAGEMENT ALL THE ABOVE SO WE DO FEEL THAT YES IT IS IMPORTANT TO MAINTAIN A FISCAL PRUDENCE BUT IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE MAKING INVESTMENTS WITH A NEED TO BE MADE. TODAY SO THAT WE CAN BENEFIT FROM THE DIVIDENDS OF THOSE INVESTMENTS YOU KNOW FIFTEEN TWENTY YEARS DOWN THE LINE WHEN WE ALL KNOW THAT CLIMATE CHANGE IS GOING TO EXACERBATE A LOT OF THESE ISSUES -- AND REALLY HAVE. DRASTIC IMPACTS ON THE ABILITY OF OF OUR STATE TO MAINTAIN RESILIENCY SO THANK YOU. MR TURN MEMBERS THE SILENCE SALAS WITH THE NATURE CONSERVANCY WE WOULD ALIGN OUR COMMENTS WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE FUND AND I THANK THE CHAIR FOR OFFERING THIS OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION WE HAVE BROUGHT UP MANY TIMES IN COMMITTEE THAT WE DO HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT. THE INTENT OF PROP SIXTY EIGHT BEING ADDITIVE IN NOT THE SUPPLEMENTAL IN NATURE SO WE WE REALLY DO HAVE THAT CONCERN AND WE WOULD CONTINUE -- TO TO VOICE SITTING COMMITTEE SO PERHAPS A DIGITAL CLARITY FROM THE ADMINISTRATION ON THEIR VIEWPOINT ON HOW THOSE FUNDS INTEND TO BE SPENT WOULD BE HELPFUL THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING QUALITY MEAT ON A WITHOUT A ONE CALIFORNIA -- WE ALSO WOULD LIKE TO OUR LINE OUR COMMENTS WITH THE PREVIOUS TWO SPEAKERS ARE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I THINK THAT. WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO HAVE CLARITY AND I CERTAINLY CHAIR THE CHAIRS. POINT OF VIEW THAT THE ANSWERED THE ADMINISTRATION GAVE ON PROP SIXTY EIGHT TO ADD. EVERYTHING ELSE I DON'T THINK FROM MY POINT OF VIEW SATISFACTORY EITHER WE'VE HAD THIS CONVERSATION BOTH WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND WITH THIS COMMITTEE. WE BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD CONTINUE TO BE INVESTING IN OUR NATURAL RESOURCES SIMPLY BECAUSE WE NEED TO BE PAYING. AND INVESTING. MONEY INTO INTO THIS -- SECTOR WITH. YELP LOOK QUITE FRANKLY LESS EXPENSIVE MONEY THAN BOND DOLLARS AND WE TRULY BELIEVE THAT THIS IS ONE OF THE WAYS IN WHICH WE CAN. ACHIEVE THAT ARE ON THE ISSUE OF THE OF THE DFW DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE'S. ISSUE REGARDING -- UNDER SUBSCRIBER -- WETLANDS -- ISSUES -- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE WANT. TO ENCOURAGE NOT ONLY THIS COMMITTEE. EXPANDTHAT -- THOSE FUNDS BEYOND JUST COASTAL WETLANDS INCLUDE. CENTRAL VALLEY WEAPONS AS WELL HEY WE BELIEVE THAT THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY THERE ISN'T AS MUCH AS OVER SUBSCRIPTION TO THAT BECAUSE WE WANT TO SEE SOME OF THOSE INVESTMENTS THEY ARE AND WE BELIEVE IN NOT A NUMBER OF CENTRAL OUT COMMUNITIES. WOULD BENEFIT FROM THAT THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING ANALLY ZERO DEFENDERS OF WILDLIFE AND WE WOULD LIKE TO LINE OURSELVES WITH ON ONE COMMENTS AS WELL AND SPECIFICALLY HIGHLIGHT THE WETLAND RESTORATION PROGRAM AS WELL WE'VE LOST OVER 90% OF CALIFORNIA'S WETLANDS. ALREADY AND THE STATE WATER BOARD JUST ENACTED NEW RULES TO PROTECT WETLANDS FROM JUDGE UNTIL ACTIVITIES BUT EVEN THEIR OWN ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT WE ARE CONTINUING TO HAVE A NET LOSS OF WETLANDS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND WHEN WE WENT TO BAT FOR PROP SIXTY EIGHT IT WAS CERTAINLY UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT THE MONEY WOULD BE ADDITIVE AND AND NOT SUPPLANT THE G. DRIVE MONEY SO WE CERTAINLY WOULD LIKE TO SEE HAPPEN THANK YOU. HI AM IDEAL WITH CALIFORNIA RELIEF I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR THE COMEDIANS CONSULTANTS. FOR INCLUDING THIS TOPIC IMPORTANT TOPIC -- AND IT'S CAUSING IT ON AN OPEN FORUM -- I WANT TO LIE MY COMMENTS -- WITH AUDUBON AND I'M MEDIA IF AND DEFENDERS -- I DO WANT TO CLARIFY THAT THE BOND MONEY THAT WAS ALLOCATED FOR URBAN FORESTRY WILL BE INCUMBENT BEFORE IT JANUARY FIRST SO THERE IS NO FUNDS. FROM PROP -- SIXTY EIGHT FOR URBAN FORESTRY -- AND THEN SEE -- AND THE KIDS ARE WEARING FOR STREET MULTIPLE. MINISTRY -- TO THIS IS TOO HIGH. OF YEAH THERE MULTIPLE -- STRAPS AND FINAL REPORTS SUCH AS THE FINAL CAR IN PLANTS THAT SAYS THAT WE NEED TO INCREASE OUR URBAN TREE CANOPY BY 10% BUT THERE'S NO MONEY FUNDED. THERE'S NO FUNDS ALLOCATED FOR THAT THE EIGHTY URBAN FOR SHE NEVER GREEN PROGRAM.

VERY SUPPORTIVE OF ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND FOR NATURAL WORKING LANCE -- THIS IS ALL ABOUT [inaudible] TAKING BOLD. NEW STEPS TO REDUCE. CARBON. FROM THE ATMOSPHERE SEQUESTER CARBON FROM THE ATMOSPHERE HE'S OUR NEW THINGS THAT WE'RE DOING -- AND WERE LEADING THE NATION IN HOW WE DO IT AND IT'S GOING TO COST. TO DO IT IT'S AN APPROPRIATION THAT IS NECESSARY. AS WE MOVE FORWARD WITH -- TAKING THESE NEW INITIATIVES. THE LAST THING I WANT TO SAY IS THAT. OUR ORGANIZATION THE CALIFORNIA PLANS A SITE IS A PLAN CONSERVATION ORGANIZATION AND A LOT OF WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS MOVING PLANTS AROUND ON THE LANDSCAPE -- WHILE WE DO THAT WE SEE THE NEED FOR SOME ADDITIONAL FUNDING STILL. TO SUPPORT THE THE BUYER DIVERSITY INITIATIVE CALIFORNIA'S BIODIVERSITY INITIATIVE -- TO DEVELOP NEW TOOLS AND TO BACK UP. OUR SEEDBANK OF A FOR PLANT BIODIVERSITY IN CALIFORNIA SO -- WE'RE WE SUPPORT ALSO ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR YOU SEE BANKING.

HI GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE MATTEO CROWN BEHALF THE MOUNTAINS RECREATION CONSERVATION UTHORITY AND SANTA CLARA VALLEY OPENS THIS AUTHORITY -- THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR A CONTINUING TO PUSH ON THIS ISSUE -- THIS IS WE DON'T SEE PROP -- SIXTY EIGHT INTEGER ATHLETES IN THIS COMPLEMENTARY ITEMS -- AND WE DON'T WANT TO SEE THIS SORT OF SAN PLANTATION ONS WE CONTINUE TO A SUPPORT YOUR PUSH ON THE ADMINISTRATION ON THIS ISSUE -- WE ALSO WANT TO REITERATE OUR SUPPORT FOR THE FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR ASK FOR NATURISTS HORSES INVESTMENT -- FROM GRF THANK YOU. ONE GERMAN BLOOM MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE PAUL MASON FOR PACIFIC FOREST TRUST AND WE WERE MUCH APPRECIATE THE TEARS LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE AS WELL. FREE WITH THE POOREST REST AGREED WITH EVERYTHING THAT'S BEEN SAID SO FAR AND I WANT TO STEP BACK AND JUST LOOK AT THE BIG PICTURE A LITTLE BIT MORE. THESE PROGRAMS ARE ALL VERY COST EFFECTIVE WAYS FOR US TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. BUT THE PLACE WHERE I THINK THEY REALLY ARE ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL IS HELPING TO ADAPT OUR NATURAL LANDSCAPE TO THE WORLD WE'RE GOING TO BE LIVING AND AND UNDER CLIMATE CHANGE. THAT'S WHERE I AM MOST FREAKED OUT BY THE LACK OF PROGRESS THE CALIFORNIA HAS MADE BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO SEE MORE EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS A BIGGER STORMS BIGGER FLOODS. THE SORTS OF INVESTMENTS WE SEE AND RESTORING MOUNTAIN MEADOWS AND FORESTS AND WATERSHED. CAN BE CRITICAL FOR BUFFERING THAT STORM FLOW AND HELPING TO MAKE SURE WE DON'T SEE ANOTHER SITUATION. LIKE WITH IN ORVILLE COUPLE OF YEARS AGO YOU KNOW THE HOT DRY SUMMERS THEY'RE GONNA BE DEALING WITH THE URBAN FORESTRY URBAN GREENING INVESTMENT OR MAKING A MAKE ALL THE DIFFERENCE IN THE HABITABILITY OF CALIFORNIA THE FUTURE. BUT THESE THINGS TAKE TIME TO COME TO FRUITION THE STREET OR PLANTING THIS YEAR AND NEXT YEAR ARE GONNA BE GREAT SHADE TREES RATHER DECADE OR TWO SO WE CAN'T BE PUTTING THE THINGS OFF WE NEED TO BE MAKING. THESE SUBSTANTIVE INVESTMENTS NOW SO I REALLY APPRECIATE YOU CAN TUNE TO PUSH THE ISSUE AND I HOPE THE ADMINISTRATION AUGMENTS THE MAY REVISE WE SEE THAT A COUPLE WEEKS THANK YOU. GENERAL WITH THE CALIFORNIA CLIMB IT AND AGRICULTURE NETWORK -- I WANTED LINE MY COMMENTS WITH A POEM MASONS FROM PACIFIC FOREST TRUST. WE WORK WITH FARMERS -- AROUND THE STATE WHO ARE INTERESTED IN THE CLAIM IT'S MORE LIKE A CULTURE PROGRAMS QUITE FRANKLY NOT ALWAYS BECAUSE THEY'RE INTERESTED IN REDUCING METHANE EMISSIONS ARE NECESSARILY SEQUESTERING CARBON. BUT THOSE SAME PROJECTS THAT ARE DELIVERING THOSE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION REDUCTION BENEFITS ARE DELIVERING BENEFITS TO THE FARM --% BUT WHAT WE'VE EXPERIENCED IN THE PAST FEW YEARS WITH THE CLAIM IS MORE AGRICULTURE PROGRAMS WHETHER IT'S HEALTHY SOILS FOR THE STATE WATER EFFICIENCY ENHANCEMENT PROGRAM OR WITH THE ALTERNATE BEEN OUR MANTRA PROGRAM. IS THAT FUNDING NUMBERS GO UP AND DOWN SOME YEARS ARE CUTTING TIRE LEASE SOME YEARS WE HAVE BOND -- MONEY SOME YEARS WE DON'T -- THE REQUIREMENTS CHANGE WHETHER IT'S TO EUROPE FOR BOND FUNDS AND IT'S BEEN QUITE CHALLENGING TO BUILD MOMENTUM ON THE GROUND AND BRING MORE FARMERS -- INTO THESE PROGRAMS -- BECAUSE THE RULES KEEP CHANGING THE FUNDING SOURCES KEEP CHANGING SOME YEARS WE HAVE FUNDING SOME YEARS WE DON'T -- WE'RE NEVER GOING TO MEET OUR CLIMATE CHANGE GOALS WITH OUT SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT IN NATURAL WORKING LAND STRATEGIES CLIMATE SMART UYGHUR CULTURE IS A KEY COMPONENT TO THAT. IT'S MAKING A DIFFERENCE IN KEY AGRICULTURAL AREAS IN THE STATE AND ALSO MAKES A DIFFERENCE FOR A LONG TERM FOOD SECURITY SIR APPRECIATE THE EFFORTS AND FOCUS TODAY. ON THE PROP SIXTY EIGHT ISSUE IT'S A CRITICAL DISCUSSION AROUND WHAT IS OUR LONG TERM STRATEGY FOR INVESTING IN NATURAL WORKING LANDS CLIMATE CHANGE STRATEGIES THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- YES MS RIVER. THANK YOU -- I WANTED TO COMMENT ON YOU KNOW SOME CONCERNS I HAVE -- PARTICULAR WITH. THAT WERE SUPPLANTING ON CAP AND TRADE FUNDING FOR THE WITH URBAN GREEN IN -- YOU KNOW AND LIKE RAIMES FROM IN LOS ANGELES WE HAVE ONE POINT EIGHT PARKS PER TEN THOUSAND PEOPLE. I'M A YOU KNOW WE'RE PARK DEFICIENT AREA YOU KNOW KIDS DON'T HAVE. ACCESS TO GREEN SPACES NEAR THEIR HOMES -- YOU KNOW I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT WE SHOOTING BE INCREASING GREEN SPACES AND NOT. ON DECREASING THEM ESPECIALLY OUR INVESTMENTS IN THOSE AREAS IN HERE THAT'S ONE THE REASONS I'VE AUTHORED AB FIFTEEN SEVENTY EIGHT YOU KNOW TO CREATE -- GREEN SPACES AND SCHOOLS IN A LOT OF KIDS -- ART SCHOOL DAY THIS IS THEIR ONLY ACCESS -- TO A POTENTIAL GREEN SPACE -- YOU KNOW UNLESS -- YOU KNOW WE CREATE MORE THAN -- THEY CURRENTLY HAVE IN THEIR IN THEIR COMMUNITIES YOU KNOW SO -- I THINK WE SHOULD BE USING BOTH OPPORTUNITIES THROUGH THE G. G. pINCREASE GREEN SPACES ESPECIALLY IN DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. THANK YOU ANY OTHER COMMENTS. WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR A PROVIDING US. WITH INFORMATION TODAY ON ON ON THIS ITEM -- AS I'M SURE YOU KNOW I'M A BIT FRUSTRATED -- BY WHAT WE'RE HEARING I THINK IT'S VERY CLEAR -- THAT -- VOTERS SPOKE IN FAVOR OF PROVIDING -- MORE REVENUE -- NOT TO THE EVENING OUT THE BUDGET OR UTILIZING -- THESE PRECIOUS FUNDS -- FOR FOR OTHER PURPOSES -- FROM MY POINT OF VIEW I THINK IT'S JUST BACKED UP BY LOGIC AS MUCH AS ANYTHING ELSE THESE -- THE VOTERS VOTED TO SUPPLEMENT OUR FUNDING -- THIS IS -- THE THE ISSUES THAT -- PROP SIXTY EIGHT ARE. INTENDED TO ADDRESS ARE OF CRITICAL IMPORTANCE -- TO A TO ALL CALIFORNIANS BUT PARTICULARLY FOR THOSE TWO TO THOSE. WHO CARED ENOUGH TO VOTE ON THIS MEASURE AND -- TO INCREASE REVENUE SOURCES SAY A THING VERY CAREFULLY AS WE ALL KNOW ABOUT -- ABOUT THESE ISSUES SO WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY -- TO TO ALLOCATE THE FUNDS IN A RESPONSIBLE WAY THAT REFLECTS THE THE OF USE OF THE OF THE VOTERS AND I DON'T THINK THAT -- THE CURRENT EXPENDITURE PLAN -- FOR THESE FUNDS -- REFLECTS THAT SO I'M VERY MUCH LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING THE MAY REVISE AND HOPING THAT -- WE WE WILL SEE -- MARKEDLY DIFFERENT APPROACH. THERE'S NO FURTHER COMMENT SENT WILLA DISMISS YOU AND THANK YOU FOR FOR BEING HERE TODAY WE DO HAVE THAT ON VOTES AND TO TAKEN BEFORE WE DO THAT I WANT TO JUST -- POINT OUT THAT I'VE BEEN ASKED BY A NUMBER OF ADVOCATES AND MEMBERS TO KEEP VARIOUS BCP'S OPEN BECAUSE OF PENDING REQUESTS TO AUGMENT THOSE PROPOSALS AND I WANT TO CLARIFY -- THAT ACTION ON THOSE BCP'S WILL NOT UNDERCUT THE ABILITY FOR THIS COMMITTEE TO PROVIDE THOSE REQUIRED AUGMENTATIONS -- SO I'M HOPING THAT THAT CLARIFIES -- OF THAT PARTICULAR ISSUE FOR FOLKS WHO MIGHT BE CONCERNED AND TO WITH THAT WILL MOVE ON TO OUR AT ON BOATS.
