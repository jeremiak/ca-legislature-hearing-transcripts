MOST OF US AGREE IS MORE

01:10:06.902 --> 01:10:09.138
RESPONSIBLE -- YOU KNOW WHERE I

01:10:09.204 --> 01:10:10.673
WHERE I DIVERT A LITTLE BIT AND

01:10:10.739 --> 01:10:12.007
I'LL I'LL TALK A LITTLE BIT

01:10:12.074 --> 01:10:14.243

01:10:14.310 --> 01:10:18.614
PROUD UC GRADUATE MYSELF -- AND

01:10:18.681 --> 01:10:19.982
I'M PROUD OF THAT UNIVERSITY IN

01:10:20.049 --> 01:10:23.185
BECAUSE I'M PROUD OF THAT SYSTEM --

01:10:23.252 --> 01:10:24.820
I CANNOT CAN ALLOW IT TO

01:10:24.887 --> 01:10:26.388
CONTINUE TO RUN THE WAY THAT IT

01:10:26.455 --> 01:10:27.256
IS.

01:10:27.323 --> 01:10:29.892
I CANNOT ALLOW THE STATUS QUO.

01:10:29.959 --> 01:10:32.261
OF HOW THAT UNIVERSITY SYSTEM IS

01:10:32.328 --> 01:10:34.863
BEING OPERATED TO CONTINUE.

01:10:34.930 --> 01:10:37.232
AND SO FOR ONE I'M GOING TO

01:10:37.299 --> 01:10:39.768
DIVERGE FROM CONTINUING THIS

01:10:39.835 --> 01:10:41.904
THIS GAME OF APPROVING

01:10:41.971 --> 01:10:44.139
ENROLLMENT NUMBERS ONLY GET NO

01:10:44.206 --> 01:10:46.609
DATA -- JUST BASICALLY RIGHT IN

01:10:46.675 --> 01:10:48.077
A BLANK CHECK ON ENROLLMENT

01:10:48.143 --> 01:10:51.046
NUMBERS -- IN THE UC SYSTEM.

01:10:51.113 --> 01:10:53.082
WITHOUT BEING PROVIDED ANY ANY

01:10:53.148 --> 01:10:55.551
REAL HARD DATA AS TO HOW MANY

01:10:55.618 --> 01:10:57.486
PEOPLE THEY INTEND TO ENROLL IN

01:10:57.553 --> 01:10:58.887
A GIVEN YEAR.

01:10:58.954 --> 01:11:00.222
AND WHEN WE STILL DON'T REALLY

01:11:00.289 --> 01:11:02.157
HAVE STRONG ASSURANCES THAT

01:11:02.224 --> 01:11:03.559
WE'RE GOING TO GET.

01:11:03.626 --> 01:11:06.362
THE AMOUNT OF IN STATE STUDENTS.

01:11:06.428 --> 01:11:09.131
ENROLLED IN OUR UC SYSTEM WHICH

01:11:09.198 --> 01:11:11.600
WAS THE GOAL OF THE MASTER PLAN --

01:11:11.667 --> 01:11:13.202
BUT THE OTHER GOAL THE MASTER

01:11:13.268 --> 01:11:15.337
PLAN WAS NOT TO MAKE YOU SEE.

01:11:15.404 --> 01:11:17.106
THE BIG ENROLLMENT -- THAT

01:11:17.172 --> 01:11:19.475
UNIVERSITY AND I THINK A LOT OF

01:11:19.541 --> 01:11:21.577
THAT MONEY IS BETTER SPENT.

01:11:21.644 --> 01:11:23.646
ON OUR CSU SYSTEM WHOSE ACTUALLY

01:11:23.712 --> 01:11:25.614
BEING RESPONSIVE TO US IN THIS

01:11:25.681 --> 01:11:26.849
OF FAT IN THIS AFFECT.

01:11:26.915 --> 01:11:28.784
WHOSE ACTUALLY ENSURING THAT WE

01:11:28.851 --> 01:11:30.719
ARE GIVING OPPORTUNITIES. TO

01:11:30.786 --> 01:11:32.788
STUDENTS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA.

01:11:32.855 --> 01:11:34.289
AND PROVIDING THOSE

01:11:34.356 --> 01:11:35.658
OPPORTUNITIES.

01:11:35.724 --> 01:11:37.793
MUCH BETTER THAN THE UC SYSTEM

01:11:37.860 --> 01:11:39.628
IS RIGHT NOW -- SO I WON'T BE

01:11:39.695 --> 01:11:42.665
SUPPORTING -- THESE MEASURES THE

01:11:42.731 --> 01:11:44.166
CONTINUOUS DOWN THAT PATH OF

01:11:44.233 --> 01:11:46.068
JUST KIND OF OPENING UP THE THE

01:11:46.135 --> 01:11:50.873
ENROLLMENT -- FUNDING FOR THE UC

01:11:50.939 --> 01:11:51.173
[inaudible]

01:11:51.240 --> 01:11:53.042
I THINK.

01:11:53.108 --> 01:11:55.711
ON THE MENTAL HEALTH FUNDING I

01:11:55.778 --> 01:11:57.479
BELIEVE THIS IS A GOOD STEP WHAT

01:11:57.546 --> 01:11:58.547
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IS

01:11:58.614 --> 01:11:59.948
EVENTUALLY DO IS NOT DO THIS

01:12:00.015 --> 01:12:02.017
PIECEMEAL AND SORT OF PARTNER
