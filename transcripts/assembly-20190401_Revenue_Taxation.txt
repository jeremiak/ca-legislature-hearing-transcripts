SEEING AND HEARING NINE COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE DOT QUIRK. CHAU ARM. IN THE ANALYSIS UNDER G.. A CHEESE ME UNDER HALF THEY POINT OUT THAT YOUR PROGRAM IS CONSIDERABLY. OUR CAN BE INTERPRETED AS BEING BROADER. THEN THE VETERANS AND IN PARTICULAR ARE THAT THE DISABILITY -- NOT BE SERVICE RELATED WHEREAS -- I WOULD FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE WITH THE BILL IF IT -- FOR GAVE THE SALES TAX ON ITEMS PROVIDED SPECIFICALLY BY THE VETERANS ADMINISTRATION. RATHER THAN -- SHAPE BUT PRIVATELY BECAUSE IT'S NOT -- YOU KNOW ADDITIONAL. EQUIPMENT BROAD PRIVATELY THAT'S OUTSIDE OF THE REST OF THAT PROGRAM SO THAT'S A CONCERN I HAVE WHICH IS. GET IN THE ANALYSIS THANK YOU. FIVE I APPRECIATE THAT THROUGH THE CHAIR IF I MAY UM YEAH I APPRECIATE THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER QUIRK THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE WERE LOOKING AT AND WE WERE ACTUALLY IF THIS BILL PASSED OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE LOOKING AT DOING SOMETHING VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING. IN THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE BUT IF THERE'S A AMPLE OPPORTUNITY I WOULDN'T MIND DOING IT IN THIS COMMITTEE AS WELL [inaudible] OKAY. ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SAYING THAT WE DO HAVE OUR PERTAIN TO DO IT HERE AS WELL AS IT DOESN'T CURRENTLY HAVE A SENSE THAT IT DOESN'T CURRENTLY CONTAIN AS CITY EVEN OF A COMPLIANCE FOR REVENUE TAX CODE. SECTION FORTY ONE SO WE WOULD HAVE TO FIX THAT AS WELL SO -- WITHOUT WHICH LIKE TO CLOSE -- JUST RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE AND LOOK FORWARD TO THE OPPORTUNITIES -- TO HELP MAKE IT BETTER WHAT WILL WORK WITH YOU THANKS. THANK YOU THANK YOU. FILE ITEM NUMBER. ONE ASSEMBLY MEMBER BONTA WOULD YOU LIKE TO OPEN. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THANK COLLEAGUES THANK YOU STAFF FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT AB TWO EIGHTY SIX WHICH I AM PROUD TO BE WORKING ON IN A BIPARTISAN FASHION WITH MY COLLEAGUE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER TOM LACKEY WHOSE ARE HERE TO TESTIFY AS WELL AND WORKING ON THIS AS WELL WITH JOINT AUTHORS. ASSEMBLYMEMBERS COOLEY AND JONES SAWYER I WANT TO START BY SAYING THAT WE WILL BE AMENDING THE BILL TO COMPLY WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF REVENUE AND TAXATION CODE SECTION. FORTY ONE WHICH OUTLINES SPECIFIC GOALS PURPOSES AND OBJECTIVES THAT THIS BILL WILL ACHIEVE ALONG WITH DETAILED PERFORMANCE INDICATORS FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO USE. WHEN MEASURING WHETHER OR NOT THE BILL IS MEETING THOSE GOALS PURPOSES AND OBJECTIVES? WE THINK THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT BILL OUT FOR TWO REASONS ONE IT WILL. HELP WITH THE MIGRATION OF CANNABIS BUSINESSES AND CONSUMERS FROM THE ILLICIT MARKET TO THE REGULATED MARKET PLACE. TO IT WILL INCREASE TACK AT TAX REVENUE OVERALL WHICH IS ESTIMATED TO BE -- AT THAT LAST ESTIMATES A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS SHORT OF PROJECTIONS HOW WILL IT DO THIS THIS IS A NASCENT BUSINESS THAT BIG AB INDUSTRY THE CANNABIS INDUSTRY IT'S A CHANGE. OF LAW THAT WE'VE HAD IN A VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME WHEN WE IN TWENTY FIFTEEN PASSED MC RSA FOLLOWED BY PROP -- SIXTY FOUR PASSED BY THE WILL OF THE VOTERS AND NOW WE HAVE A REGULATED MARKET PLACE THAT PROTECTS THE PUBLIC IN CHILDREN THE ENVIRONMENT ENSURE SAFE PRODUCTS. AND I AM HELP MAKE SURE THAT THINGS ARE DONE IN A COMPLIANT. WAY AND RIGHT NOW THERE ARE BARRIERS FOR FOLKS TO THE LISTEN MARKET TO ENTER THAT THAT REGULATED MARKET THE ONE THE BIGGEST ONES IS THAT THE HIGH COST OF DOING BUSINESS AND IT BY TEMPORARY LOW TEMPORARILY LOWERING THE TAXES. A SUSPENSION OF THE CULTIVATION TAX FOR THREE YEARS AND IT LOWERING OF THE EXCISE TAX FOR THREE YEARS FROM 50% 211%. REALLY ENABLE ENCOURAGE AND SENT OUR INDUSTRY TO COME INTO THE REGULATED MARKET PLACE WHICH IS WHAT WE WANT THEM TO BE -- NOW YOU MIGHTASK BY LOWERING THE TAXES WHAT WILL THE IMPACT BE ON OUR TAX REVENUE WE BELIEVE THAT IT WILL RAISE TAX REVENUE HOW. IT SOMEWHAT COUNTERINTUITIVE BUT IT WORKS LIKE THIS BY LOWERING THE TAX RATE. OUT MORE FOLKS ARE ABLE TO PAY THE TAX AND WHEN YOU HAVE MORE PARTICIPANTS PAYING A TAX EVEN IF IT'S LOWER YOU HAVE A BIGGER TAX BASE AN OVERALL HIGHER TAX REVENUE. WE'VE SEEN THAT HAPPEN IN OTHER STATES IN STATES LIKE WASHINGTON -- AND SO WE THINK THAT -- THE CONCERNS RAISED BY THAT -- THE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS BLOW PROJECTIONS OUT CAN BE ADDRESSED BY THIS BILL SO WE GET A TWO FOR IN A SENSE WE GET MORE CANNABIS INDUSTRY MEMBERS COMING INTO THE REGULAR MARKET PLACE AND WE GET GREATER REVENUE THAT COULD BE SPENT AND ALL THE GOOD THINGS. AT DECIMATED OUTLINED IN PROPOSITION SIXTY FOUR SO WE THINK THIS IS THE AS SENSIBLE BILL THAT WILL CREATE. A GREAT BENEFIT FOR OUR STATE. AND I WANT TO GIVE ASSEMBLY MEMBER TOM LACKEY AN OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK BEFORE WE GO TO OUR WITNESS JARED KILO PRESIDENT. OF THE UNITED CANNABIS BUSINESS ASSOCIATION. ASSEMBLY MEMBER LACKEY. THANK YOU WELL LOT OF WHAT I HAVE TO SAY IS -- IN LINE WITH WHAT WAS YOUR SHARED. AND WITH. ALL DUE RESPECT FOR YOUR TIME I'M NOT GOING TO REPEAT EVERYTHING. BUT ESSENTIALLY -- WE HAVE A LIST OF MARKET THAT'S FOR A ROBUST HERE. AND QUITE FRANKLY THEY HAVE BEEN ENGAGED IN BEHAVIOR. AND MARKETING SENSE -- THE COMPASSIONATE. ACT. NINETEEN NINETY SIX AND SO THEY'RE VERY VERY -- SKILLED AND EXPERIENCED IN KNOWING HOW TO GET THE PRODUCT. INTO THE HANDS OF THE CONSUMER AND NOW WE HAVE -- PROP SIXTY FOUR WHICH WAS -- I THINK. SOMETHING THAT OF COURSE OUR PEOPLE WANTED AND SO WE NEED TO DO IT RESPONSIBLY AND UNFORTUNATELY THE DEMAND HAS NOT DIMINISHED BUT WHAT HAS. IS THE ABILITY TO COMPETE WITH THE ILLICIT MARKET WITH ALL THESE REGULATORY. COSTS AND EXPENSES AND A CIRCUMSTANCES THAT OF COURSE THE ILLICIT MARKET HAS NOT ENOUGH. AND SO WE'RE TRYING TO JUST EQUALIZE THE PLAYING FIELD AND ALL UNDERSTAND AND AND A MORE SIMPLER FORM. AND I BELIEVE THOSE WHO HAVE INVESTED HURT HEAVILY DESERVE TO BE SUPPORTED BY THIS TAX REDUCTION THIS REASONABLE APPROACH. SO THEY CAN COMPETE FAIRLY -- THEY NEED TO BE REWARDED IN RIGHT NOW THEY ARE NOT AND SO WE JUST WANTED. TO FOLLOW THE THE FOOTSTEPS OF THE STATE OF WASHINGTON -- THERE AN EXAMPLE ONCE THEY REDUCE THEIR RATES AND SIMPLIFY THEIR TAX. SYSTEM THEY INCREASED THEIR ABILITY -- TO TO GAIN. ACTUAL MONEY AND AND UP WE JUST NEED TO FOLLOW THAT SIMPLE PATHWAY. THANK YOU WITNESSES SUPPORT -- THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS CHAIRED KILO I'M THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED CAN WITH BUSINESS ASSOCIATION. I'M ALSO A RETAIL DISPENSARY OWNER IN THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES AND IN NAPA -- I WANT TO COME HERE AND SUPPORT TO EIGHTY SIX IN THE REDUCTION OF FROM A RIGHT NOW THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES WE HAVE ABOUT A 42% TAX IF YOU TAKE ALL THE TAXES FROM SALES TAX GROSS RECEIPTS TAX EXCISE TAX. AND CULTIVATION TAX WE ARE WE ARE DEFINITELY AT A DISADVANTAGE WHEN IT COMES TO A COMPETITIVE PRICE -- AND A LOT OF THE LEGAL BUSINESSES IN THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES ARE LAYING OFF EMPLOYEES BECAUSE THEY CANNOT COMPETE WITH AN ILLICIT MARKET -- WE'RE SEEING ABOUT A 30% REDUCTION IN EMPLOYMENT -- AND A LOT OF THOSE EMPLOYEES ARE GOING TO THE ILLICIT MARKET WHERE THEY CAN -- COLLECT UNDER THE TABLE -- LABOR COSTS AND DON'T PAY INTO THE SYSTEM AT ALL -- RIGHT NOW YOU'RE LOOKING AT A SYSTEM THAT HAS ACOSTA BANKING COMPLIANCE TAXES REBUILDING EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE ADAPTION ADOPTION TO THE EVER CHANGING LANDSCAPE OF COMPLIANCE. ALL OF THESE ADDED COST OF DOING BUSINESS ARE NOT COSTS OF THE ILLEGAL -- DISPENSARY OWNERS OR ILLEGAL BUSINESS OPERATORS HAVE TO PAY -- ESTIMATES RIGHT NOW ABOUT 80% OF THE COMMERCIAL CANNABIS THAT IS CURRENTLY BEING SOLD IS BEING SOLD THROUGH THE ILLICIT MARKET. SO FOR LOOKING AT THE VOLUME THAT THIS TAX CAN CAPTURE YOU'RE LOOKING AT AN 80% MARKET SHARE AND EVEN IF WE CAPTURE TEN FIFTEEN OR 20% OF THAT. THE TAX REVENUE IS IS IS VERY LARGE IN COMPARISON -- WE NEED TO GIVE THESE REGULATED BUSINESSES SOME FIGHTING CHANCE TO COMPETE AGAINST THE ILLICIT MARKET -- AND WITHOUT THAT WE ARE CURRENTLY LOOKING AT A REDUCTION OF THE OVERALL USAGE OF REGULATED CANNABIS CURRENTLY IN CALIFORNIA SO I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO SAY THAT -- IF WE REALLY CAN'T GET THE VOLUME OF SALES UP INSIDE OF THE REGULATED INDUSTRY -- THE AMOUNT OF TAX DOLLARS RECEIVED CAN MAYBE HIT OUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR -- TAX GAP THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE SO I'M HOPING THAT YOU SUPPORT -- AB TWO EIGHTY SIX JUST SAYS -- CAM WITH RETAILERS STILL.

EIGHT THIRTY TWO WHICH WILL HELP LOW INCOME FAMILIES BECOME HOMEOWNERS CURRENTLY CALIFORNIA'S FACING A HOUSING CRISIS. WITH A LACK OF AFFORDABLE HOMES FOR LOW INCOME FAMILIES TO HELP ADDRESS THIS HOUSING CRISIS THIS PROPOSAL WILL STIMULATE PRIVATE INVESTMENT. IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING -- THROUGH TAX CREDITS THIS TAX CREDIT WOULD INCENTIVIZE DONORS TO CONTRIBUTE -- TO TO CONTRIBUTE TO NON PROFIT BUILDING HOMES FOR LOW -- LOW INCOME RESIDENTS AND FAMILIES SPECIFICALLY OF THESE ARE OF NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE BUILDING LONG TERM RESALE AND DEED RESTRICTED HOMES.

AND PRIOR TO THIS ROLE I LED NEVADA COUNTY HABITAT FOR HUMANITY UP IN THE FOOTHILLS FOR TEN YEARS. HOW CALIFORNIA INCLUDES FORTY ONE HABITAT OFFICES THAT ARE ALL FOCUSED ON PROVIDING AFFORDABLE HOMEOWNERSHIP THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND WE COVER THE MAJORITY OF ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES? INCLUDING ALL URBAN AND MOST SUBURBAN IN MANY RURAL AREAS. AS A FIVE OH ONE C. THREE NON PROFIT ORGANIZATION AND AFFORDABLE HOME PROVIDER WE STRONGLY SUPPORT AB EIGHT THIRTY TWO BECAUSE IT WILL LEAD TO MORE HOUSING IN CALIFORNIA. WE DESPERATELY NEED TO INCREASE OUR HOUSING STOCK IN CALIFORNIA BUT WE ESPECIALLY NEED TO PROVIDE MORE AFFORDABLE HOMEOWNERSHIP OPPORTUNITIES. HABITAT FOR HUMANITY SERVES FAMILIES THAT EARN BETWEEN THIRTY AND 80% AND MY EXACTLY WHAT THIS BILL SUPPORTS. AND THEY ARE OUR EXACT TARGET POPULATION OUR HOMES ARE ALREADY TYPICALLY DEED RESTRICTED TO REMAIN IN THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING POOL. AND THEY ALSO INCLUDE SHARED EQUITY AGREEMENTS. THE ELEMENTS DESCRIBED IN THE BILL SIMILAR LEGISLATION ALREADY SUPPORTS RENTALS SO THIS BILL WOULD HELP INCREASE AFFORDABLE HOMEOWNERSHIP AND WOULD HELP FURTHER BALANCE. THE AND THE RATIO BETWEEN HOMEOWNERSHIP AND RENTAL. AND STATE WIDE IT'S COSTING US IT'S COSTING ALL OF OUR HABITATS. HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS MORE DOLLARS TO PROVIDE THE SAME NUMBER OF AFFORDABLE HOMES EACH YEAR SO IT'S JUST GOING UP AND UP. SO THIS LEGISLATION WILL HELP US RAISE MORE FROM PRIVATE INVESTORS WE'RE VERY GOOD AT BEING ABLE TO LEVERAGE WE WERE SUCCESSFUL IN RED AND LEVERAGING REDEVELOPMENT AGENCY DOLLARS AND THIS COULD HELP REPLACE THAT -- IT ALSO WORKS REALLY WELL AT EVERY COMMUNITY SO IN OUR WORLD COMMUNITIES THIS THESE FUNDS WILL GO A LONG WAY TO HELP PROVIDE MORE UNITS.
