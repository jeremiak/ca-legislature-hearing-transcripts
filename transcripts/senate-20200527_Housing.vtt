00:31:36.194 --> 00:31:37.595
WORK IN PROGRESS WE STARTED OFF

COUPLE YEARS AND THEY'RE NOT

00:31:46.037 --> 00:31:47.105
GOING TO HAVE THE BAND WITH AND

00:31:47.171 --> 00:31:49.474
SO ONE OF THE AMENDMENTS WAS TO

00:31:49.540 --> 00:31:51.876
ALLOW THEM TO. PARTICIPATE AS

00:31:51.943 --> 00:31:56.114
A- AS A PARTNER WITH NON. IT

00:31:56.180 --> 00:31:56.848

00:31:56.914 --> 00:31:59.817
LOCAL. ORGANIZATIONS IN EACH

00:31:59.884 --> 00:32:01.152

00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:04.355
YOU'RE DEALING WITH A PANDEMIC.

00:32:04.422 --> 00:32:05.923
AND YOU'VE GOT THOUSANDS OF

00:32:05.990 --> 00:32:07.325
PEOPLE THAT ARE AFFECTED

00:32:07.392 --> 00:32:08.760
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE

00:32:08.826 --> 00:32:11.562
THAT ARE AFFECTED. IT'S ALWAYS

00:32:11.629 --> 00:32:12.497
GOING TO BE A CHALLENGE. TO

00:32:12.563 --> 00:32:14.699
IDENTIFY WHAT PART OF

00:32:14.766 --> 00:32:16.868
GOVERNMENT IS GOING TO BE ABLE

00:32:16.934 --> 00:32:17.802
TO TAKE ON THE RESPONSIBILITY

00:32:17.869 --> 00:32:21.372
TO HANDLE A LOT OF PAPERWORK.

00:32:21.439 --> 00:32:23.908
AND THE AND THE- OVERSEE. MAKE

00:32:23.975 --> 00:32:25.576
SURE ANY IS ACTUALLY GETTING

00:32:25.643 --> 00:32:29.113
WHERE IT SHOULD GO AND SO- WITH

00:32:29.180 --> 00:32:30.815
THAT IN MIND ALMOST ANY

00:32:30.882 --> 00:32:32.216
ORGANIZATION THAT WE CHARGE

00:32:32.283 --> 00:32:34.485
WITH THIS KINDS OF KIND OF

00:32:34.552 --> 00:32:36.521
RESPONSIBILITY IS GOING TO HAVE

00:32:36.587 --> 00:32:38.056
A CHALLENGE BUT I DO THINK THAT

00:32:38.122 --> 00:32:40.425
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE

00:32:40.491 --> 00:32:42.860
RECOGNIZE THAT THAT PROBABLY

00:32:42.927 --> 00:32:45.530
PEOPLE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL KNOW

00:32:45.596 --> 00:32:46.898
HOW TO DISTRIBUTE AND HOW TO

00:32:46.964 --> 00:32:49.701
SET UP FOR START. BETTER FIGURE

00:32:49.767 --> 00:32:52.203
OUT THAT. AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE

00:32:52.270 --> 00:32:53.438
TO BE OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM TO

00:32:53.504 --> 00:32:56.174
STAFF UP THE END HAPPY

00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:57.809
INFRASTRUCTURE IN PLACE TO BE

00:32:57.875 --> 00:32:59.010
ABLE TO DEAL WITH THIS BUT I.

00:32:59.077 --> 00:33:00.178
QUESTION BECAUSE I THINK WE'VE

00:33:00.244 --> 00:33:02.280
ALL DEALING WITH IT. THE ISSUE

00:33:02.347 --> 00:33:03.915
WITH THE V. D. QUITE FRANKLY AS

00:33:03.981 --> 00:33:05.283
WE HAD A THREE POINT 8%

00:33:05.350 --> 00:33:06.818
UNEMPLOYMENT RATE AND SO THEY

00:33:06.884 --> 00:33:08.920
WERE PERFECTLY STAFFED. FOR A

00:33:08.986 --> 00:33:11.189
THREE POINT 8% UNEMPLOYMENT AND

00:33:11.255 --> 00:33:12.757
QUITE FRANKLY IT HAD THEY HAD

00:33:12.824 --> 00:33:14.959
TOO MANY EMPLOYEES. AT BUDGET

00:33:15.026 --> 00:33:15.927
TIME WE WOULD HAVE BEEN SAYING

00:33:15.993 --> 00:33:17.028
WHY WE HAVE SO MANY PEOPLE

00:33:17.095 --> 00:33:19.397
WORKING A DVD EITHER BUDGET IS

00:33:19.464 --> 00:33:20.898
INFLATED WE NEED TO CUT REESE

00:33:20.965 --> 00:33:23.634
SAYS. BUT FROM A THREE POINT.

00:33:23.701 --> 00:33:26.971
8% UNEMPLOYMENT TWO I THINK THE

00:33:27.038 --> 00:33:29.807
NUMBER NOW IS ABOUT 15% THAT'S

00:33:29.874 --> 00:33:35.380
HUGE IN. AND DOES. IS ALL THE

00:33:35.446 --> 00:33:36.114
FACT THAT THERE'S BEEN SOME

00:33:36.180 --> 00:33:37.482
HICCUPS IN IN GETTING ARE BUT

00:33:37.548 --> 00:33:39.484
BUT WE DO IT IS IT THE REALITY

00:33:39.550 --> 00:33:41.886
OF THE SITUATION IS THAT ALMOST

00:33:41.953 --> 00:33:42.687
ANYWHERE WE PUT THIS IS GOING

00:33:42.754 --> 00:33:44.489
TO BE DIFFICULT AND I HAVE NO.

00:33:44.555 --> 00:33:46.691
NO IN. THE CITY IT'S- A

00:33:46.758 --> 00:33:48.092
QUESTION OF HAVING THEM BE THE

00:33:48.159 --> 00:33:49.894
ADMINISTRATORS OF A PROGRAM AND

00:33:49.961 --> 00:33:51.195
THEN GET IT GETTING THE LOCAL

00:33:51.262 --> 00:33:53.564
RESOURCES NECESSARY TO. TO ROLL

00:33:53.631 --> 00:33:55.233
THIS KIND OF PROGRAM. ONE DAY

00:33:55.299 --> 00:33:56.567
YOU'RE LOOKING AT OPTIONS AND

00:33:56.634 --> 00:33:58.803
ALTERNATIVES- BECAUSE WE'VE GOT

00:33:58.870 --> 00:34:00.671
THIS CAL AS WELL WHICH HAS BEEN

00:34:00.738 --> 00:34:02.173
A BILLION DOLLAR SOFTWARE

00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:04.342
PROBLEM- BUT I. DIDN'T DO SOME

00:34:04.409 --> 00:34:05.977
RESEARCH. AND THE STATE OF

00:34:06.043 --> 00:34:07.512
RHODE ISLAND. WAS ABLE TO MOVE

00:34:07.578 --> 00:34:09.313
PAGE IT'S UNEMPLOYMENT.

00:34:09.380 --> 00:34:12.784
IMPLOSION RATHER QUICKLY AND-

00:34:12.850 --> 00:34:14.419
SO THEY- THEY USE SOFTWARE THAT

00:34:14.485 --> 00:34:17.655
WAS. IN THE CAR IT WAS IT. AND

00:34:17.722 --> 00:34:18.990
SO THEY'VE BEEN GIVING A THE

00:34:19.056 --> 00:34:19.791
BEST IT'S PROMPTLY SO MAYBE

00:34:19.857 --> 00:34:20.391
THERE'S SOME. THAT WE SHOULD

00:34:20.458 --> 00:34:22.093
LOOK AT THAT TO HELP. WITH THIS

00:34:22.160 --> 00:34:25.596
PROGRAM- THE NEXT QUESTION I

00:34:25.663 --> 00:34:27.665
HAD. WAS SINCE FOR ESTABLISHING

00:34:27.732 --> 00:34:30.001
A NEW- THERE WOULD REQUIRE

00:34:30.067 --> 00:34:31.869
BUREAUCRACY BUT IT WOULD ALSO

00:34:31.936 --> 00:34:33.738
REQUIRE A LOT OF FUNDING. SO

00:34:33.805 --> 00:34:36.474
I'M JUST CURIOUS. EVEN THOUGH I

00:34:36.541 --> 00:34:37.041
DON'T BELIEVE THAT A LOT OF

00:34:37.108 --> 00:34:39.243
THESE. PEOPLE THAT WERE LAID

00:34:39.310 --> 00:34:41.045
OFF THERE WAS SORT OF A SELF

00:34:41.112 --> 00:34:42.980
INFLICTED BY BY THE CAPITAL SO

00:34:43.047 --> 00:34:44.582
NEEDS TO STEP UP IN SOME WAY I

00:34:44.649 --> 00:34:45.583
JUST DON'T KNOW WHERE THE

00:34:45.650 --> 00:34:46.851
MONEY'S GOING TO BE COMING FROM

00:34:46.918 --> 00:34:48.886
AND OF COURSE SHOULD HAVE FROM

00:34:48.953 --> 00:34:51.088
THE GENERAL FUND. OKAY SO IT'S

00:34:51.155 --> 00:34:53.458
A BUDGET PRIOR FIFTH OFFICE OF

00:34:53.524 --> 00:34:54.992
IT TODAY BECAUSE I THINK THE

00:34:55.059 --> 00:34:57.929
STATE HAS A RESPONSIBILITY.

00:34:57.995 --> 00:34:58.496
BECAUSE IT KIND OF. CREATED

00:34:58.563 --> 00:35:01.699
SOME OF THIS PROBLEM SO- BUT I

00:35:01.766 --> 00:35:03.935
I'M CONCERNED ABOUT. HOW WE

00:35:04.001 --> 00:35:05.269
MANAGE IT SO THAT WE JUST DON'T

00:35:05.336 --> 00:35:06.404
FRUSTRATE A LOT OF GOOD PEOPLE

00:35:06.471 --> 00:35:08.239

ISLAND SO. IT'S QUITE A

00:35:19.917 --> 00:35:21.752
DIFFERENCE FROM WHAT WE FACE IN

00:35:21.819 --> 00:35:24.856
CALIFORNIA. BUT I- I REALLY

00:35:24.922 --> 00:35:28.159

BETWEEN OTHER PROPOSALS WHICH

00:35:39.537 --> 00:35:41.639
IS- WOULD TAKE A LITTLE BIT

00:35:41.706 --> 00:35:43.741
MORE TIME TO SOMETHING THAT'S

00:35:43.808 --> 00:35:46.110
NEEDED RIGHT NOW- I THINK

00:35:46.177 --> 00:35:48.112
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. IN

00:35:48.179 --> 00:35:51.682

PEOPLE WHO ARE DESPERATE BUT

00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:04.562
THEY CERTAINLY HAVE A SENSE OF

00:36:04.629 --> 00:36:06.797
HOW TO DO IT ON THE GROUND AND

00:36:06.864 --> 00:36:08.165

DONE WITH THEM IN MIND ON THE

00:36:16.140 --> 00:36:18.142
PRACTICAL SIDE OF IT- BECAUSE

00:36:18.209 --> 00:36:21.379
ON THE ISSUE OF. WHETHER OR NOT

00:36:21.445 --> 00:36:23.648
WE SHOULD DO THIS WE ABSOLUTELY

00:36:23.714 --> 00:36:24.615
SHOULD DO IT. THEY'RE GOING TO

00:36:24.682 --> 00:36:26.851
FACE IT NOW IN A LITTLE BIT

00:36:26.918 --> 00:36:29.620
