WHEN I WAS BORN IN LAST AUGUST I UNDERSTOOD THE ISSUES THE LEGISLATURE WAS GRAPPLING WITH COULD BE CENTRAL TO MY WORK. FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF MY CPUC DURATION. IT WAS LAST SUMMER THAT A SECOND ROUND OF MAJOR WELFARE LEGISLATION WAS PASSED BY THE LEGISLATURE AND INDEED SIGNED EVAN. ANY AND ALL HELL OF. EACH OF OUR MAJOR. TRICK IN THE- ON UTILITIES WAS UP SIR WITH THE LARGEST THEM IN EARLY STAGES OF BANK THE- AN THERE WERE SOME. DOUBTS. UC'S SENSE OF. AND IT'S A TO AN TO THE TECH.

AS ALSO REQUIRED FOCUSED ATTENTION TO SUPPORT THE FINANCIAL STABILITY OF THE HOUSEHOLDS ACROSS OUR STATE IT IS CALLED THE PLAN IS TO MAINTAIN AND INCREASE ACCESS TO THE POLICE SERVICES TO BECOME MORE SENSUAL. DURING THE CALL PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS AS FAMILIES HAVE MOVED TO SHELTER WORK AND LEARN FROM HOW. I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT THE PEOPLE WE SAW HEAVEN AND- DESTRUCTION AND LAW IN.

WITH THE HOPE THAT MY EX IN UNDERSTANDING AND MANAGING SECTOR ORGANIZATIONS COULD HELP IMPROVE THE CPUS SEES ABILITY TO THESE CHALLENGES WITH URGENCY DOES REQUIRE. IT AND WE HAVE MOVED FROM ONE DESTRUCTION TO ANOTHER OVER THE LAST YEAR MY ASSESSMENT OF THE CPC AND THE RECENT CHANGES WE HAVE MADE TO IT'S CALLED ORGANIZATIONS. HAVE OCCURRED IN. OF RESPONDING TO THESE ACTIONS CON APPROACHES TO REGULATE OFF POKE ON LOOKING AT WHAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY NOT TOWARDS TOMORROW AT THE CDC WE CANNOT REGULATE FROM BEHIND.

ATHLETES USED WITH DELAYED ENTITIES. IN THE EVER TO CURB AND MEN. IN WE SEE THROUGH THE OF LIFE OKAY. WE ARE IN HERE IN OUR MODEL BASED ON A ROOM RECORD INVEST AND- ACTIONS.

THAT'S A LIFETIME AGO NOW DOESN'T IT. WHAT A WEIRD WORLD WHERE WE'VE WE LIVE IN A WAY I DO HAVE I DO HAVE A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS I THINK WE'VE BEEN GIVEN THESE IN ADVANCE BECAUSE SINCE WE DON'T HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO GET TOGETHER. MY FIRST QUESTION HAS TO DO WITH- PS PS THE TECH FIRE. OCCURRED IN MY DISTRICT IN A CHECK OUT TWELVE HOMES. AND IT OCCURRED DURING ONE OF THESE SHUTDOWNS AND SO THESE P. S. P. S. PROGRAMS HAS GREATLY IMPACTED THE SAFETY. AND DAILY LIVING FOR CONSTITUENTS. DIO YOU THIS IN MY AREA BRAG CITY ONLY 2% OF THEIR SERVICE AREA- CAME UNDER P. S. P. S. IT MUST HAVE BEEN A 100% HI DISTRICT. BECAUSE IT WAS PRETTY WIDESPREAD. BUT MOVING FORWARD- WHAT STRATEGIES IS THE PEACE LOOKING. TO REDUCE THE IMPACT OF THE PS T. S. ON RATE PAYERS. THANK YOU MUCH WE HAVE DONE A LOT AND IF I MAY LIKE TO TAKE SOME SOME TIME TO- WALK THROUGH- THE MANY THINGS THAT WE HAVE DONE- ON PS YES PREPARATION. THREE I OWE YOU. INCLUDING THE I OWE YOU THAT SERVICE IN YOUR TERRITORY. THERE'S A LOT AND I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT SO I WANT T WALK THROUGH THIS VERY CAREFULLY STARTING WITH- LAST OCTOBER- I ISSUED A LETTER TO P. JEANNIE DIRECTING THEM TO FILE UPDATES- WEEKLY I WITH IT'S A P. YOU SEE. ON A SERIES OF CORRECTIVE ACTIONS INTENDED TO IMPROVE. PLANNING AND EXECUTION OF THE P. S. TS WHICH YOU ALREADY CALL WAS AND- WAS. QUITE DISASTROUS ON OCTOBER EIGHTEENTH I HELD AN EMERGENCY MEETING- TO PUBLICLY ADDRESS THE MISTAKES AND THE OPERATIONAL GAPS IDENTIFIED IN P. GENIES OCTOBER PS PS EVENTS. THE P. JEANNIE EXECUTIVES OR CALL BEFORE US AND EXECUTIVE- CEO BILL JOHNSON APPEARED ALONG WITH THEM. ON JANUARY THIRTY YES I ISSUED A ACR AND TO- IN MY DE JENNER DE ENERGY STATION PROCEEDING WHICH ORDER P. JEANNIE. ON TO UPDATE THAT PS PS OPERATING PROTOCOLS THE THINGS THAT I ASKED THEM TO DO IS UPDATE THE OPERATING PROGRAMS WITHIN FORTY FIVE DAYS- WE COLLABORATED WITH- YES AND CAL FIRE FIRE TO PLAN AND EXECUTE YES YES- EXERCISES. ESTABLISH WITHIN THIRTY DAYS WORKING GROUP'S OF THE TRIBAL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ACROSS THE GENIE IS A SERVICE HERE. AND THE NAME ALSO THE IS TWENTY RECALLS USING THE FEET THOSE WERE GROUP'S ON IN IN THE D. ENERGY STATION PRO SEATING ON GENERATE WE ISSUED AT THE FOR WE ISSUED THE PROPOSAL FOR PUBLIC COMMENT- ON APRIL TWENTY SEVEN DOUBLES DECISION WAS ISSUED- FOR COMMENT IN THE GENERAL ELEMENTS OF THAT. WERE TO RESTORE POWER AS SOON AS POSSIBLE NO LONGER THAN TWENTY FOUR HOURS AFTER ARE FOLLOWING THE CONCLUSION YES AT AND CAN BE. THE REGIONAL I WAS WORKING GROUP'S WITH THE TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS- AND THEIR PAY THEIR PUBLIC SAFETY PARTNERS. COORDINATE ADVISORY BOARDS TO CONSIST OF PUBLIC SAFETY PARTNERS- CONDUCT PSCS EXERCISES I MENTIONED EARLIER. YES AND PLANNING BASED ON LOCAL DEMOGRAPHICS AND SURVEY DATA FOR THE FOR MEETINGS OF A VARIETY OF SAFETY NEEDS FOR THE VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. AND WE ON. I ALSO- WAS CONCERNED ALONG THE WAY AND AGAIN I'M FOCUSING ON P. GINNY RIGHT NOW AND I DON'T ADDRESS IN A MOMENT THE OTHER TWO- I OWE YOU. I FELT IN JANUARY AND FEBRUARY AND EARLY MARCH WAS NOT NEEDING MANY OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAD ESTABLISHED BOTH IN MY LETTER OF OCTOBER FOURTEENTH LAID OUT ABOUT TWENTY FIVE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT THEY NEED TO. TO BE DEALING WITH AS WELL AS- SOME OF THE THINGS THAT THEY HAD PROMISED ALONG THE WAY THEY WOULD BE DOING SO. I ASKED MY- YOUR FOLKS HERE IT THE P. UC CAROLINE JACOB THOMAS THOMAS JACOBS SORRY AND- RACHEL- HEATER SON. TO MEET WEEKLY. AND HAVE THE HAVE PEACH WITH P. JEANNIE IN ORDER TO REPORT EXACTLY WHAT THEY WERE DOING AND WHEN THEY WOULD HAVE THOSE THINGS COMPLETED IN TIME WILD SEASON SO- AT THE SAME TIME I'M AT THE WHILE FIRE MITIGATION PLANS BY ALL THREE I- USER BEING SUBMITTED TO THE P. UC THEY WERE DOING AND- FEBRUARY I WAS DRESSED THOSE LATER IT. IS NEEDED SO- WHAT THESE MEETINGS HAVE HELPED US UNDERSTAND IS WHAT AND WHEN HE JENNY AND TO KEEP HER AND WE'VE EXTENDED THESE MEETINGS WITH. WITH YES AS WELL AS CAL FIRE MEETING BY WE WITH OUR- SAN DIEGO GAS ELECTRIC AS WELL AS SAN AS WELL AS AND AS- SHOWN US THAT FRANKLY THE GINNY'S CAISTER SLIGHTLY BEHIND ON SEVERAL THINGS THEY HAVE THEIR WEBSITE UP IT'S WORKING PROPERLY IT'S BEEN WELL TESTED BY CALIFORNIA. TECHNOLOGY THEY ARE SLOW ON THEIR LAYS ON AS BEING ESTABLISHED WITH- THE- LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND TRIBES THEY ARE GETTING MAKING HEADWAY THERE EVER. IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE CAN IS. THAT DURING THE P. S. P. S. ONLINE EVENTS THEY HAD A VERY DIFFICULT TIME GETTING INFORMATION OUT OF- PARTICULARLY EACH INNING AND SOMETIMES ADDISON AS WELL. SO THOSE LIAISONS ARE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO BE ESTABLISHED WITH THE COUNTY AND THE COUNTY'S EMERGENCY MANAGERS. ON WE ALSO HAVE BEEN TRACKING WHAT THEY'RE DOING AND HARDENING THEIR SYSTEMS. THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL PROPOSALS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE IN TERMS OF PRIORITIZING THE HARDENING OF CERTAIN SUBSTATIONS ARE PRIORITIZING IN TERMS OF TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS. MOST OF THE BACK UP THAT THEY WILL BE HAVING- THIS COMING WELFARE SEASON WILL BE AT DIESEL GENERATION AND IT WILL BE TEMPORARY. THEY ARE PLANNING LONGER TERM TO HAVE- RENEWABLE. BACKUP GENERATION- AND IN MY GRADES BUT THAT IS GOING TO TAKE A BIT LONGER. AND WE I AS I SAID I WAS VERY CONCERNED UNTIL MARCH BUT I DO BELIEVE IN THE CASE OF. ON PGA ANY THEY HAVE QUICKER. BEAR PREP. ANYWAY OR WHETHER STATE HAVE MORE AIRCRAFT THAT WILL GETTING TO YES YES BOTH BEFORE AND AFTER THEY HAVE. ALSO ADDED CAMERAS TO THEIR SYSTEM THEY'VE ADDED SOME MORE ANALYTICAL ABILITIES SIMILAR TO SAN DIEGO GAS ELECTRIC IN TERMS OF UNDERSTANDING WHAT THE PREDICTIVE NATURE OF FIRES AND- WEATHER IS. SO THAT IS A HELPFUL ALL THREE OF THE I. O. U.'S WILL BE DOING EXERCISES WITH THE WORLD AND ALL THE LOCAL AND COUNTIES AND TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS. IN JUNE. JULY AND THEN THE LAST WILL BE AUGUST BY SAN DIEGO GAS ELECTRIC SO SORRY TO BE LONG WINDED- THERE'S ACTUALLY EVEN MORE THAT WE'VE DONE BUT THAT GIVES YOU SENATOR A LITTLE BIT OF AN OVERSIGHT HOW. CRITICALLY WE HAVE BEEN WORKING CLOSELY WE HAVE BEEN WORKING AND HAVING OVERSIGHT OF THE P. S. TS PREPARATIONS. YEAH THAT THING FOR THAT ANSWER VERY MUCH LOOKING FORWARD TO HAVING RENEWABLE ENERGY GENERATORS. RING A FIRE SEASON I GOT A CALL FROM AN EIGHTY TWO YEAR OLD WILL TEAR DOWN VETERAN. WHO'S ON OXYGEN HAS POWER TURNED OFF AND ASSEMBLYMAN LACKEY AND I RENTED A GENERATOR WENT TO HIS HOUSE AND SET IT UP AND SETTING UP THESE DIESEL GENERATOR OUTSIDE WITH FIRES ALL AROUND IT MAKES IT MAKES ABSOLUTELY NO SENSE SO. I KNOW WE'VE GOT WE'RE GOING TO TRANSITION OUT OF THAT BUT THAT'S GOOD THEY WERE MOVING THAT DIRECTION. I ALSO HAVE TO- CCA'S IN MY DISTRICT. AND THEY HAVE CONSIDER CONCERNS IN TERMS OR TRANSPARENCIES FROM FROM THE AUDIO USE. THIS IS A IS ARGUE THAT VERY DIFFICULT TO GET ANY INFORMATION AND OFTEN WHEN THEY DO THEY DON'T GET IT IN TIME FOR THE NECESSARY IT ODDITY. IN THESE ERROR ERRORS IN THEIR OPINION HAVE SIGNIFICANT HAS CREATED SIGNIFICANT COST TO ALL RATEPAYERS SO THE QUESTION IS WHAT EFFORTS WE TAKE TO INCREASE TRANSPARENCY OF CALL GENERAL. SURGICALLY WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THE ENERGY RESOURCES RECOVERY ACCOUNT. THANK YOU SENATOR YES TO BE USED AS THE WORKING WITH IT CCA'S FOR SEVERAL YEARS PROVIDE THEM WITH MORE ACCESS TO THE UTILITY CALCULATIONS THAT GO INTO THAT THE POWER CHARGE. IN DIFFERENCE THAT ADJUSTMENT OR THE P. C. I. A. THIS IS THE MECHANISM THAT IS USED TO MEET THE STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS. THAT THEIR CUSTOMERS REMAIN WITHIN THE YOU JUST LOOK AT WHAT THEY DO NOT SEE THEIR BILLS GO UP. DUE TO THE CREATION OF A C. C. A. AN SPCA CUSTOMERS DO NOT PAY COSTS THAT SHOULD BE PAID FOR THOSE ARE ESSENTIALLY IN. CITIES I THINK THE CHALLENGES THAT THE CALCULATION QUESTION OUR MARKET SENSITIVE INFORMATION. ARE TO BE KEPT CONFIDENTIAL I'M FROM THE ENERGY MARKET PARTICIPANTS. AND THE CCA'S OUR MARKET PARTICIPANTS. AND WE ARE WORKING WITH THE CCA'S TO ALLOW FOR THEM TO SIGN A NON DISCLOSURE AGREEMENTS AND HAVE SELECTED REPRESENTATIVES. HAD TO DO THAT DATA. THIS IS CURRENTLY BEING FURTHER REVIEWED IN THE CURRENT POWER CHARGE IN DIFFERENT ADJUSTMENT PROCEEDINGS UNTIL OF THE NAMES WE GIVE THANKS. BUT THE PC IS HEADED TO FINDING WAYS TO. PROVIDE MORE ACCESS TO THIS THAT THE KEY DATA SURROUNDING THE- YOU SEE I A AND THE OTHER MARKET SENSITIVE DATA WHERE WHERE WHERE THIS ISSUE AND WORKING WORKING ON ANSWER. GREAT THANK YOU FOR THAT KIND OF GOT A FINAL QUESTION. I'M GONNA ASK YOU A QUESTION I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE ANSWER IS. I DON'T BELIEVE YOU DO THE TWO OF US MY GOSH THESE I STILL HAVEN'T FIGURED OUT HOW TO USE READERS AND A MASK IT WITHOUT APOLOGIZE FOR THAT. NO IT'S NOT QUESTION- I WILL EVENTUALLY FIGURE THAT PART OUT. SO CALIFORNIA'S YOU UTILITIES ARE SPENDING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON WELFARE MITIGATION MEASURES WHICH YOU WERE ALREADY LAYING OUT. WHICH THEY ARE NOT CURRENTLY AUTHORIZED TO INCLUDE IN RATES GIVEN THE FACT THAT CO THAT ON CUSTOMERS IN THE LARGE EXPENDITURES I OWE YOU. ALREADY INCURRED HOW DO YOU SEE BALANCING THE FOR I ARE USED TO RECOVER WHAT THEY'VE SPENT AT A TIME WHEN CUSTOMERS MAY NOT BE ABLE TO AFFORD RATE INCREASES. THIS IS CRITICAL- ON AND THIS IS GOING TO BE A CRITICAL TASK FOR THE P. YOU SEEN NOT ONLY NOW BUT IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS- THAT SEAT YOU SEIZE RATE AND BILL IMPACT FOR CASH SHOW VERY LARGE PIECES IN CALIFORNIA WE DON'T TAKE ACT TO REDUCE THE OVERALL UTILITY COSTS THE MAIN DRIVER THE RATE INCREASES IN FACT WILL BE YOU WHILE FIRE MITIGATION. ON SOME OF AND IT A PROGRAMS ARE ALL INCREASING THE COSTS WE'RE LOOKING INTO WE'RE LOOKING VERY CLOSELY INTO ALL OF THE- WE ARE. ENERGY DIVISION IS DOING A VERY THOROUGH REVIEW OF ALL PROGRAMS TO SEE WHAT A SUCCESS OF THE PROGRAMS ARE WHAT IMPACTS THERE HAVE BEEN POSITIVE NEGATIVE. AND WHAT RATE INCREASE. I'M AND WHETHER THAT CAN CAN INDEED BE AND MEDICAID AND WE HAVE ALSO BEEN VERY CONCERNED ABOUT- AS YOU MENTIONED SIR THAT KOBE IN NINETEEN IMPACTS AND WE HAVE MOVED OUR- WE HAVE OF MOVED TO THE CLIMATE CREDIT OFF SENSE. AND THAT THAT THAT CUSTOMERS ENJOY- IN THE SUMMER MONTHS- TO I JUST SORT OF THEIR BILLS DOWNWARD AT P. JEANNIE AND EVER SINCE CLIMATE CREDITS- WOULD HAVE NORMALLY BEEN DISPERSED IN OCTOBER NAY BEEN MOVED UP. AND SPLIT- TWO BILLS IN MAY AND JUNE- AND THEN WE PROPOSED A DECISION FOR SMALLER UTILITIES LIBERTY AND OR- OCTOBER CLAIMING CREDIT APPLY IN JUNE AND JULY. SO THOSE ARE SOME SOME SMALL AREAS OF HORTON EVERY DOLLAR COUNTS PARTICULARLY IT ALWAYS PARTICULARLY NOW AND WE'RE EXPERIENCING THE DIFFICULTIES OF KOBE NINE. NINE IT IS AN ONGOING. WITH WHAT MEDICAID CLASS WE REALLY HAVE TO BE EXTRAORDINARILY CAREFUL AND THOUGHTFUL. ABOUT THE- THE RATE RECOVERY THAT THE I- USE ARE ARE ABLE TO HOUSE. GREAT RIGHT SHARE YOUR ANSWER AGAIN PRESHOW YOUR WILLINGNESS TO SERVE AND LOOK LOOKING FOR TO SPEAK YOUR CONFIRMATION. MAKES THE MOTION. THANK YOU SIR THANK YOU MISTER VICE CHAIRMAN THE SENATOR MINE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR IN. GOOD AFTERNOON PRESIDENT BACK SURE I WANTED TO START BY. OFFERING MY CONGRATULATIONS AS WELL NOT ONLY ON YOUR APPOINTMENT ANA AS PRESIDENT THE P. C. BUT TO THANK YOU FOR YEAR. YEARS OF SERVICE BOTH IN GOVERNMENT IN IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR WE'RE LUCKY TO HAVE YOU. ON LEAVE THE PCS OFFICIALLY NOW WITH THE MANY ISSUES WE'RE DISCUSSING. OF P. JEANNIE BANKRUPTCY FIRE IS ITS SENTRA. THE UNITED HAVE A CHANCE TO SPEAK YESTERDAY AND I APPRECIATED THAT OPPORTUNITY I DID WANT TO RAISE FROM MY COLLEAGUES- AS YOU KNOW I HAVE. DIABLO CANYON IN MY DISTRICT IN SAN LUIS OBISPO COUNTY IT'S GOING THROUGH A DE COMMISSIONING. LAND DE COMMISSIONING AND THE WILD PRIMARY JURISDICTION IS WITH THE NRC THE FEDERAL- NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION. THE PC DOES HAVE CERTAIN OVERSIGHT RESPONSIBILITIES AND AUTHORITY. AND I WAS JUST HOPING YOU COULD SHARE WITH ME AND COLLEAGUES AND OTHERS- KIND OF YOUR VIEW AND PARTICULARLY NOW WITH COOL BUT NINETEEN THE LOCAL CONCERN. IS SAFETY SAFETY SAY HE- THAT MAY REVISE INCLUDES AN ADDED TUITION FOR THE P. YOU SEE. DEDICATED TO OVERSIGHT OF THE DECOMMISSIONING PROCESS AND WE JUST APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENT TOM. WHAT PRIORITY THIS IS FOR YOU- THE P. YOU SEE AND IF THERE'S ANY PARTICULAR CONCERNS WITH COVERT NINETEEN AND- SOME OF THAT WORK FORCE WORKING FROM HOME AND NOT AT THE PLANT. IS SENATOR AND WE DID HAVE A VERY NICE VISIT YESTERDAY AND I APPRECIATED THAT GREATLY. AS AS YOU WELL STATE AND- THE HE JENNY ARM SHUT DOWN OF REACTOR ONE WILL OCCUR IN TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY SKEWS ME TWENTY TWENTY FOUR AND REACTOR TO AND TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. AND AS YOU WELL KNOW TO THE P. GINNY REPAIRS HAVE BEEN FUNDING AND THE DECOMMISSIONED TRUST FUND TO COVER THE COST OF THE DECOMMISSIONING FACILITY. THE ACTUAL PROCESS AS YOU NOTED OF THE DE COMMISSIONING IS OVERSEEN BY THE NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION- BUT THE P. JEANNIE AND HAS PROVIDED TIMELY AS IN THAT DO YOU. THE COMMISSION FILINGS TO THE PC. ON DE IT I'LL JUST STEP ASIDE FOR A SECOND THE CODE RED NINETEEN I'M NOT MY MUST AND NOT PERSONALLY AWARE RIGHT NOW OF HOW- DIAVEL IS WORKING WITH THEIR WORK FORCE OBVIOUSLY FOR SAFETY REASONS AND NUCLEAR POWER PLANT MUST HAVE. PEOPLE ON SITE TO HAVE IT OPERATING PROPERLY SO- HOWEVER- THE- THEY THE WORK FORCE IN IN THE AGREEMENT WILL CERTAINLY BE TAKEN CARE OF THROUGH THE DECOMMISSIONING PROCESS. AND UNDER THE TIME LINES AND AS YOU KNOW SIR THAT THE LAST OF THE BUILDINGS IN THE ANTIQUE STRUCTURAL. WILL BE REMOTE JAN TWENTY THIRTY FIVE SO THIS IS A LENGTHY PROCESS I MEAN THE SPENT FUEL- MY MAIN STORED ON SITE. UNTIL TWENTY FIFTY SEVEN THAT'S OF COURSE IS IF THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY HAS PERMANENT- STORAGE FACILITY BY THAT TIME BEING A NATIVE OF THAT AND I'VE FOR IT NOT TO BE YUCCA MOUNTAIN JUST HAVE TO SAY. ANY RATE. I IT IS IT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO US AS YOU NOTED WE DO HAVE ONE POSITION THAT WE HAVE RECEIVED IN THE AND THE BUDGET BUT FOR AT ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE-POSITION THAT WILL BE OVERSEEING THE- DECOMMISSIONING EFFORTS AS AS OUR RESPONSIBILITY IN THAT IS I THINK YOU ALSO- WERE ENQUIRING. SENATOR ABOUT THE LAND AND NOTHING AROUND I AM HELLO AND NOTHING REGARDING THE TREATMENT OF LANCE'S THEN DETERMINE. AT THIS TIME- IN THE DAY OUT LOCAL CANYON RETIREMENT DECISION P. GENIE IS REQUIRED TO COME BACK TO THE PC. IF THEY EVER HAVE ANY PLANS TO DO ANYTHING WITH THOSE LANDS. SO I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT I MENTIONED THAT TO YOU AND I'M MORE THAN HAPPY TO STAY CLOSE TO YOUR STAFF. AND YOU- TO KEEP YOU INFORMED OF THOSE THINGS GREAT WELL I APPRECIATE THAT AND PARTICULARLY THE- RECOGNITION OF THE PC OVERSIGHT OVER ANY. DISPOSITION OF SURROUNDING LANDS AS YOU POINTED OUT WHEN. WHEN DIABLO CANYON WAS ORIGINALLY LICENSED IT WAS LICENSED WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT THE SPENT RODS WOULD BE EXPORTED FROM THE AREA. AND WITHOUT KNOWLEDGE OF THE EARTHQUAKE FAULTS THAT HAVE SINCE BEEN DISCOVERED. AND SO PART OF THE DE COMMISSIONING DECISION. WAS BASED ON THE SEISMIC CHALLENGES FACING. THE OUTLOOK CANYON- AND THERE'S NO PROSPECT AT THIS POINT OF THE SPENT RODS GOING ANYWHERE THEIR STORTING CASKS ON THE SITE AND SO THE SAFETY CONCERNS OF THE COMMUNITY. WILL CONTINUE FAR BEYOND THE ACTUAL DECOMMISSIONING OF THE REACTOR SO I APPRECIATE YOUR SENSITIVITY TO THAT IN YOUR- STAFF'S OVERSIGHT- AND AGAIN WE ALSO DISCUSSED THE IMPORTANCE OF TRANSPARENCY IN THE PUBLIC PROCESSES WE DID HAVE A P. UC. ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE CONVENE IN A HEARING. IN SAN LUIS OBISPO RELATED TO ONE OF MY PIECES OF LEGISLATION STUDYING ECONOMIC IMPACTS AND THAT WAS WELL ORGANIZED IN PROVIDED. BOTH NOTICE IN STRONG PUBLIC PARTICIPATION SO WANTED KNOWLEDGE THAT MAN MAN IN CHARGE HAVE A FINAL QUESTION AND- RESIDENT BATCH I DID NOT I APOLOGIZE I DIDN'T RAISE THIS WITH YOU YESTERDAY. AND I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'LL BE ABLE TO ANSWER BUT YOU COULD MAYBE TAKE THIS QUESTION UNDER SUBMISSION- IF YOU DON'T HAVE AN IMMEDIATE RESPONSE BUT- IT'S BEEN BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION THAT SOME OF THE RATE. PAYER FUNDED ENERGY EFFICIENCY MONIES- REPORTEDLY AMOUNTING TO ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED EIGHTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS IN FUNDS. THAT HAVE NOT YET BEEN ALLOCATED- COULD YOU COMMENT ON THIS AND THE STATUS AS TO THE STATUS OF THOSE FUNDS AND AGAIN I REALIZE I DIDN'T BREAK WITH ESTHER AND IF IT'S NOT A- SO I WOULD WELCOME. THEIR RESPONSE AT YOUR CONVENIENCE. CENTER I AM FAMILIAR WITH WITH IT BUT I DON'T WANT TO- GIVE YOU MISINFORMATION SO IF I MAY I WENT I'D LIKE TO TAKE THAT THAT QUESTION BACK TO STAFF AND GET BACK TO YOU AND THE COMMITTEE REGARDING THAT QUESTION THANK YOU GOOD AND I APPRECIATE THAT AND I WILL LOOK FORWARD TO. HEARING BACK FROM YOU WANT THAT INFORMATION IS OBTAINED IN WITH THAT I TO LOOK FORWARD TO. CASTING A STRONG VOTE IN SUPPORT. OF YOUR CONFIRMATION AN THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU SENATOR RUNNING- I WILL A SAY HOW MUCH I APPRECIATE ALL OF MY COLLEAGUES ASK AND- THE MOST SERIOUS QUESTIONS IT'S ALWAYS GOOD TO GO LAST. I HOWEVER I DO WANT TO ADD- TO WHAT SENATOR MONNING SAID I HE TALKED ABOUT- DIABLO CANYON AND I OF COURSE WOULD BE REMISS NOT TO BRING UP SANTA NO FREE AND SAN DIEGO COUNTY SOMETHING I KNOW THAT SENATOR BATES ALSO- GIVEN THE PROXIMITY- WOULD PROBABLY AGREE THAT ANY. OVERSIGHT AND MONITORING THAT WE ARE ABLE TO HAVE AT THE STATE LEVEL RECOGNIZING THAT IT'S REAL THE FEDERAL ENERGY. COMMISSION'S RESPONSIBILITY BUT WE HAD A SIMILAR SITUATION OF SPENT FOR FUEL RODS BEING STORE OUT ON THE COAST AND COMMUNITIES CONCERN SO I WILL. THAT PUBLIC. BUT KNOWING THAT YOU ARE COMPLETELY OF THAT PRESENT BADGER. I'M THIS IS A INCREDIBLE OF IMPORTANT UP SO HIGH HAVE ONE MAYBE TWO QUESTIONS AND IT HAS TO DO WITH- THE PGA ANY BANKRUPTCY AND I RECOGNIZE THAT THERE ARE SENSITIVITIES AROUND THAT ISSUE. BUT YOUR THOUGHTS GENERALLY I WANT TIME GIVEN THE AMOUNT OF DEBT THAT P. JEANNIE WILL HAVE COMING OUT OF BANKRUPTCY. YOUR THOUGHTS IN TERMS OF- WILL WE BE IN DANGER OR WILL THEY BE IN DANGER OF DEFAULTING IN THE EVENT IT WAS DENIED ACCESS TO EITHER AB TEN FIFTY FOUR WILDFIRE FUND. OR COST RECOVERY- IF ANOTHER MASSIVE FIRE IT'S SORT OF A BROAD QUESTION OF WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS ARE ABOUT THIS PROCESS. AND ALSO MAYBE AT THE SAME TIME ALL ASK ABOUT YOUR THOUGHTS I TO SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT PROTECTING WRITE PAPERS AND ENSURING. PROPER OVERSIGHT AND NONPROFIT CORPORATION IF THAT IS THE PLAN B. E. R. THAT MOVES FORWARD FROM THE ADMINISTRATION- AS A NONPROFIT CORPORATION THEY WOULD BE EXEMPT FROM C. WOULD THEY BE EXEMPT FROM CPUC JURISDICTION ANY THOUGHTS ON. HOW THE LEGISLATURE COULD INSURE RATE PAYERS ARE PROPERLY PROTECTED SO KIND OF A- HUGE QUESTION WITH BUDGET COMPONENTS BUT YOUR THOUGHTS I WOULD GREATLY APPRECIATE. PRESIDENT BADGER. WELL ON THE LAWYERS HAVE TOLD ME I HAVE TO SAY THE FOLLOWING. A PROPOSED DECISION FROM THE ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE WAS ISSUED ON APRIL TWENTIETH TWENTY TWENTY AND IS SCHEDULED TO BE VOTED ON BY THE COMMISSION TOMORROW WELL I CAN DESCRIBE THE ELEMENTS AND THE PROPOSED DECISION WHICH I'M HAPPY TO DO. THIS MATTER IS STILL UNDER CONSIDERATION AT THE COMMISSION AND I CAN NOT PREJUDICE THE RESULT OF THE DELIBERATION THAT IS STILL OCCURRING. SO HAPPY TO WALK THROUGH THE ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSED DECISION IF THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL ON. I THINK THAT UNDER OBVIOUSLY STATUTE TEN FIFTY FOUR OUR- JOB OUR RESPONSIBILITY WAS TO WORK TO ENSURE THAT P. JEANNIE HAD. AN AVENUE OUT OF BANKRUPTCY BY JUNE THIRTY AND WITH OUR VOTE TOMORROW WE WILL HAVE ACCOMPLISHED THAT. I WILL SAY IF I MAY JUST. THERE ARE FOR ONE SECOND THAT PROCEEDING WAS- STARTED IN OCTOBER. AND THE PC OFTEN HIS CRITICIZED FOR NOT BEING ABLE TO BE NIMBLE AND NOT BEING ABLE TO WORK QUICKLY. AND PROCEEDINGS SUPPOSEDLY ARE ALWAYS GOING TO TAKE EIGHTEEN MONTHS WELL IN SEVEN MONTHS WE'VE COMPLETED A VERY COMPLICATED. AND DIFFICULT TASK AND- I LOOK FORWARD TO OUR DISCUSSION TOMORROW AND TAKING ALL THE PUBLIC COMMENT THAT WE WILL RECEIVE AND THEN VOTING ON THE DECISION. HAVING SAID THAT. RIGHT THE PRESUMPTION IS THAT THEY WILL COME OUT OF BANKRUPTCY IN JUNE ON JUNE THIRTIETH. ACTION IS THAT THAT IN SO DOING THEY WILL BE PROPERLY. AT FINANCED I DON'T THINK I SHOULD GO ANY FURTHER INTO SOME OF THE DETAILS- MADAM PRO TEM- BECAUSE I WOULD BE SPECULATING BEFORE THE DECISION I. SO DOES THAT NO I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND I APPRECIATE YOUR OB. YOUR RESPONSE AND ALSO I THINK THESE ARE THE BIG ISSUES ALL OF US ARE ACTUALLY THINKING ABOUT IN TERMS OF AS WE COME OUT OF AS AS THEY COME OUT OF BANKRUPTCY HOW CAN A BALLOT SO MANY OTHER ISSUES IN ORDER TO BE BACK SAME POSITION SO.

CAME TO CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU CENTER MOURNING THE END UP THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME- LAST WEEK TO IT AND ENGAGE ME AND TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE CONCERNS YOU HAVE WELL AS FAR AS THE SAFETY OF OUR- EMPLOYEES- AT AND THE DEPARTMENT OVERALL. OUR TOTAL NUMBER AS OF NOW AS OF LAST WEEK THE LAST COUNT AT THE END OF LAST WEEK WAS TWENTY TWO EMPLOYEES. ARE THE HIGHEST NUMBER WE HAVE IN ANY PARTICULAR DISTRICTS FIVE. WE HAVE FIVE- OF EMPLOYEES THAT HAVE TESTED POSITIVE- AND- IT IN DISTRICT THREE AND DISTRICT ALIVE AND THEN THE NUMBER SORT OF SPREAD OUT ACROSS THE STATE FROM THERE WE'VE BEEN VERY FORTUNATE I CALTRANS THAT- DEPARTMENT ARE SIZE. ON A WHICH WOULD ROUGHLY TWENTY THOUSAND EMPLOYEES- ARE WE ONLY HAVE. YOU KNOW. TWENTY TWO PEOPLE THAT ARE TESTED POSITIVE THAT OF SELF DISCLOSED SO I WORK AND ALSO I THINK IMPORTANT TO NOTICE THAT FIFTEEN OF THOSE TWENTY TWO ARE HAVE ACTUALLY. RETURN TO WORK- ON THEY'VE GONE GONE BACK TO THEIR DOCTOR IN CONCERT THEY'VE GONE THROUGH THE PROCESS AND THE- BEEN TESTED US AS WELL NEGATIVE FOR COVER NINETEEN AND THEY'RE BACK- AT OUR WORK LOOK SO WE'RE VERY FORTUNATE NOT A CALTRANS IS A RELIGION IT IS AN ENCOURAGING NUMBER IS THERE A TESTING PROTOCOL IN PLACE. FOR EMPLOYEES OF CALTRANS. WE SEE CEREMONY WEEK WE STRONGLY ENCOURAGE. THAT STAFF- YOU DO TEMPERATURE CHECKS AND DO TESTING OF THEIR OWN IF THEY'RE NOT FEELING WELL IF THEY'RE FEELING LIKE THEY THEY MAY BE COMING DOWN WITH A FEVER OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT BUT THERE'S NO REQUIREMENT FROM CALTRANS FOR COLLEGE ARE ARE TO ACTUALLY TEST- OUR EMPLOYEES BUT WE STRONGLY RECOMMEND AND ENCOURAGE STAFF TO UP TO YOU KNOW TO TEST THEMSELVES. ARM AND YOU TO YOU KNOW CHECK IN WITH THEIR THEIR HEALTHCARE PROVIDER IF THEY'RE NOT FILLING UP UP TO- UP TO GET HELP THANK YOU IS THERE IS THERE ANY DUTY FOR AN EMPLOYEE TO REPORT TO HR IF. THEY HAVE SYMPTOMS. WERE HAVE TESTED POSITIVE. THERE'S A RECALL TO DO SO IT IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT WE- ENCOURAGE WE STRONGLY ENCOURAGE AND RECOMMEND THAT IF THE HOUSE. THAT THEY REPORTED BACK TO US- YOU KNOW HOPEFULLY THAT THAT HAS BEEN THE CASE- BUT THOSE. DOES THAT LOW NUMBER THAT WE STILL HAVE. AGAIN WORK WE'RE FORTUNATE THAT THE NUMBER IS AS LOW AS IT IS NOT THAT THOSE TWENTY TWO ARE. ANYTHING TO TAKE LIKELY- BUT WORK WERE FORTUNATE BUT WE DON'T HAVE A REQUIREMENT THAT STAFF HAS TO COME IN. ON IT AND REPORT- TO US ARE SPECIFICALLY AT AT THE DEPARTMENT OR CULTURAL. THANK YOU AND THEN JUST A FINAL QUESTION ON BID. ANY PROTOCOLS IN PLACE. IN MAYBE THROUGH CONVERSATIONS WITH THE UNION REPRESENTATIVES. SO MUCH OF THE OUTDOOR WORK NOW IS IN HEAT AND- WORKERS WHO CAN MAYBE SOCIALLY DISTANCE IN SOME OF THE WORK ENVIRONMENTS BUT WHO ALSO MIGHT RIDE IN. TRUCKS OR OTHER VEHICLES TOGETHER TO WORK SITE- WHAT ARE THE PROTOCOLS BEING FOLLOWED TO PROTECT THOSE THAT ARE NOT ABLE TO WORK FROM HOME. THAT SAME MORNING THAT'S THAT'S IT NOT A QUESTION THAT ME THAT THAT WAS ONE OF THE CHALLENGING PART OF THE TRANSITION THAT WE FIND TO MAKE BECAUSE- NO THE OFFICE SPACE YOU CAN TELL PEOPLE TO ROB. YOU CAN TELL STAFF TO SPREAD OUT. AND NOT SORT OF GATHER TOGETHER BUT WHEN YOU'VE GOT. BOB CREWS THAT ARE THAT ARE ON A WORK SITE SOMETIMES THEY HAVE TO BE- IN IN THE SAME. IN THE SAME PROXIMAL LOCATION- IT BUT WE'VE WE'VE INSTITUTED SOME CHANGES WITHIN A PARTNER LIKE SAYING FOR EXAMPLE. IF YOU'RE HEADED TO A CONSTRUCTION SITE MAKE SURE THAT. YOU LIMIT THE NUMBER OF- PEOPLE IN A IN A CAB IN A IN A TRUCK VEHICLE SO INSTEAD OF YOU KNOW TWO OR THREE PEOPLE YOU KNOW GETTING A TRUCK WE LIMIT. THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO CAN GET A TRUCK. OUT WE MAKE SURE THAT BONE CONSTRUCTION SITES THAT WE STAGGER THE TIMES THAT PEOPLE TAKE BREAKS WHEN THEY GET TO A- WHAT WHAT WHEN IT'S BREAK TIME SO PEOPLE WERE NOT GATHERING TOGETHER. INTO ONE LOCATION. AT THE SAME TIME- WE'VE MADE SURE THAT THERE IS- THEY DEFINITELY HAVE PP. AND WE'VE DONE THINGS LIKE THAT MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S- CONSISTENT CLEAN AND- OR SANITIZING OF OUR KIDS THE CONSTRUCTION AREAS AND GATHERING AREAS THAT I'M STAFF ARE WILL SOMETIMES OUT SO THAT'S- THOSE ARE SOME OF THE MEASURES THAT WE'VE PUT IN PLACE BUT- SAFETY IS OUR TOP PRIORITY AS A DEPARTMENT- AND IT STARTS WITH. HOW WE RUN OUR DEPARTMENT WITH OUR OWN TEAM WITH OUR OWN STUFF WE CAN'T JUST- SAY THIS AND BE FOCUSED SOLELY ON ON THE PUBLIC IT STARTS WITH US AND I THINK IF WE HAVE A- A SAFETY MINDSET OF SAFETY APPROACH TO HOW WE DO OUR WORK THAT PLAYS OUT. WHAT THE RESPONSE WOULD BE WE HAVE UP WITH THE PUBLIC AS WELL. WE'VE WE'VE DONE THAT IN THIS BOOK THANK YOU AND THEN. ANOTHER COVERT NINETEEN BUT RELATED TO. SB ONE FUNDING SOURCES THERE'S LESS GAS LESS HIGHWAY TRAFFIC AND AS A RESULT. LESS DEDICATED FUNDING COMING IN ANTICIPATED FROM SP ONE HOUSE AT AFFECTING. EITHER CURRENT PROJECTS OR PROJECTED- PROJECTS IN TERMS OF- LOWER THAN ANTICIPATED. HIGHWAY REPAIR AND CONSTRUCTION MONEY. THANK YOU THAT IS FOR THE QUESTIONS SANTA MONICA BECAUSE THE WAY WE LOOK AT THINGS WITH AN APARTMENT WE SORT OF DIVIDE OUR WHICH DIVIDED OUR FOCUS UNTIL THE NINETEEN TO THE FIRST PART OF THE QUESTION YOU ACTS WHICH IS YOU KNOW HOW ARE YOU HANDLING AND AN AGING DE THE TEAM OF STAFF YOU HAVE AND ARE YOU MAINTAINING THEIR THEIR WELFARE AND SAFETY. AND A SECOND PART IS WHAT'S OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO THE PUBLIC AND HOW WE PERFORMING- WITH OUR WE MAINTAIN OUR PERFORMANCE TO THE GENERAL. THE GENERAL PUBLIC I'LL TELL YOU WE HAVE SEVEN HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE PROJECT- ON THE CONSTRUCTION. OF THE DEPARTMENT AND ONLY. AT TWENTY FIVE OF THOSE SEVEN HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE PROJECTS- HAVE BEEN- PUSHED BACK OR DELAYED. BECAUSE OF BECAUSE OF COVER NINETEEN. AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE REVENUE SOURCE I THINK EVERYONE KNOWS VERY WELL THAT ARE REVENUE SOURCE IS A GAS TAX. AND SO FOR. WHAT WE'VE SEEN AND WE WERE VERY FORTUNATE AGAIN IN THIS PLACE VERY FORTUNATE THAT THE PROJECTIONS THAT WERE SEEN OF THAT UP THE REVENUE IT'S NOT GOING TO DROP AS MUCH AS WE ORIGINALLY WERE ANTICIPATING. WE SAW TRAFFIC VOLUMES DROP IN THE STATE BY THAT 35% ROUGHLY ON THE MAJOR STATE OUT ON THE STATE HIGHWAY NETWORK- THE LOCAL NUMBER IS YOU KNOW WE'VE HAD SOME DEBATE ABOUT WHAT THAT PERCENTAGE DROP WHAT'S- WE WERE A LITTLE NERVOUS ABOUT ENOUGH. WELL 35% DROP IN TRAFFIC WHAT IS THAT GOING TO MEAN TO OUR REVENUE. BUT AGAIN WE'RE VERY FORTUNATE THAT WE ARE IN THAT. WORK WE'RE IN A GOOD. CASH POSITION WHAT WE ARE ANTICIPATING- BASED ON. THE INFORMATION THAT WE'VE RECEIVED FROM- THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IS THAT WE WILL HAVE A ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLAR. ROB IN REVENUES OVER THE NEXT OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS- TO THE TUNE OF WILL CLOSE TO OUR THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY MILLION OR YOU COULD BROWN OFFICE A FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. A YEAR AND GAS TAX REVENUE DECREASES OFF FOR- FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. LOW WE ARE NOT SEEN ANY INPUT IMMEDIATE IMPACT ON OUR PROJECT DELIVERY NOW THERE MAY BE SOME IMPACT IN THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR OR BEYOND- BUT THE ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS ARE EXPECTED DROP IN TAX REVENUE IS GOING TO BE SOMETHING THAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO- ADDRESS IN DUE TIME. AND IT'S OUR HOPE THAT- IF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PASSES A STIMULUS- THE BILL FOR TRANSPORTATION. AN ADDITIONAL ONE INMATE OFFSET SOME OF THAT- ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLAR DROP IN REVENUE- OVER THE NEXT FIVE. THANK YOU NAY. FINAL COMMENT FAMILY- MADAM PRO TEM YEAH WE HAD A CHANCE TO DISCUSS THIS BUT- I JUST MENTION SOME OF THE SAFETY CHALLENGES IN MY DISTRICT HIGHWAYS ONE. MAJOR TOURISM.
