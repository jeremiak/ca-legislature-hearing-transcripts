00:34:35.907 --> 00:34:36.808
AT A POINT IN THE YEAR WHERE WE

00:34:36.874 --> 00:34:38.543
USUALLY HAVE AT TWO TO FOUR

00:34:38.609 --> 00:34:40.645
INCHES OF RAIN IN THE AREA.

00:34:40.711 --> 00:34:42.079
WHICH WOULD HAVE STARTED TO TO

00:34:42.146 --> 00:34:44.682
TO GREEN UP AND AND VOICE IN THE

00:34:44.749 --> 00:34:47.318
FUELS THE SAME TIME THAT THAT

00:34:47.385 --> 00:34:48.653
WIND WAS BLOWING OVERNIGHT.

00:34:48.719 --> 00:34:50.087
NEEDLES WERE FALLING OUT OF THE

00:34:50.154 --> 00:34:53.324
PINE TREES TYPICAL ANNUAL EVENT.

00:34:53.391 --> 00:34:56.093
SO NO MATTER HOW MUCH THE

00:34:56.160 --> 00:34:58.362
NEIGHBORHOODS OF OF PARADISE

00:34:58.429 --> 00:35:01.632
WOULD HAVE RAKED OR MOVE REMOVED

00:35:01.699 --> 00:35:05.036
THE THE FUEL STRUCTURES IT ALL

00:35:05.102 --> 00:35:07.004
CAME BACK OVERNIGHT.

00:35:07.071 --> 00:35:09.140
AND THE EMBERS FROM THESE HEAVY

00:35:09.207 --> 00:35:10.908
FUELS THAT WERE STILL VERY BONE

00:35:10.975 --> 00:35:12.643
DRY -- ON

00:35:12.710 --> 00:35:14.912
THAT ON THAT PREVIOUS FIRE

00:35:14.979 --> 00:35:16.581
LANDSCAPE.

00:35:16.647 --> 00:35:19.283
SHOWERED INTO PARADISE --

00:35:19.350 --> 00:35:22.687
JUST HOURS SHORT HOURS AFTER --

00:35:22.753 --> 00:35:24.288
IGNITION OF THE FIRE --

00:35:24.355 --> 00:35:26.190
PUTTING THE FIRE IN PARADISE

00:35:26.257 --> 00:35:28.626
FROM A DISTANCE THAT NORMALLY

00:35:28.693 --> 00:35:29.694
WOULD HAVE TAKEN SIX TO EIGHT

00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:30.561
HOURS.

00:35:30.628 --> 00:35:32.363
SO IT MOVED TO FIRE VERY QUICKLY

00:35:32.430 --> 00:35:34.599
INTO TOWN THAT NEEDLE CAST

00:35:34.665 --> 00:35:36.367
ALLOWED FOR THE FIRE TO SPREAD

00:35:36.434 --> 00:35:38.002
IN TOWN VERY QUICKLY.

00:35:38.069 --> 00:35:39.437

00:52:26.309 --> 00:52:26.877
DEVELOPING.

00:52:26.943 --> 00:52:28.678
ALSO BASED ON THE SITUATION I

00:52:28.745 --> 00:52:31.581
MEAN CLIMATE CHANGE TO GROW

00:52:31.648 --> 00:52:32.916
INFRASTRUCTURE IS GOING TO

00:52:32.983 --> 00:52:34.150
CONTINUE TO AGE AND OTHER THINGS

THAT WE DO NOT SEE GOING AWAY AM

00:52:42.559 --> 00:52:44.461
I CORRECT IT --

00:52:44.528 --> 00:52:46.296
THAT ANOTHER WAY OF OF OF SAYING

00:52:46.363 --> 00:52:48.532
THAT IS THAT YOU EXPECT THE NEED

00:52:48.598 --> 00:52:49.933

00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:51.768
PROBABLY NEED MORE POSITIONS AS

00:52:51.835 --> 00:52:54.170

THERE.

00:52:55.705 --> 00:52:57.173
THE CLUB SO I THINK THAT THAT'S

00:52:57.240 --> 00:52:57.841
THE THE ISSUE THAT I'M TRYING TO

00:52:57.908 --> 00:53:00.644
GET OUT OF ITS ONLY POTENTIAL --

00:53:00.710 --> 00:53:02.045
IT WOULD SEEM THAT THERE SOME

00:53:02.112 --> 00:53:03.413
UNCERTAINTY IN THE WORKLOAD AS

00:53:03.480 --> 00:53:05.515

I DO NOT BELIEVE IT OR DEBT --

00:53:11.521 --> 00:53:14.157
I BELIEVE THAT WILL CONTINUE AND

00:53:14.224 --> 00:53:16.426
STEADY STATE IF NOT INCREASE --

00:53:16.493 --> 00:53:19.396
FOR IT TO CLEAR REASONS OF AGAIN

00:53:19.462 --> 00:53:21.431
CLIMATE CHANGE AND AN EXPANDING

00:53:29.072 --> 00:53:30.140
GROWS.

00:53:30.206 --> 00:53:32.943
THE NEED FOR INCREASED STAFF

00:53:33.009 --> 00:53:35.011
WILL PROBABLY GROW WITH THAT.

00:53:35.078 --> 00:53:38.081
IT'S GOING TO NEED TO ENSURE

00:53:38.148 --> 00:53:40.517
THAT THE TOYS ARE ACTUALLY LIVE

00:53:40.584 --> 00:53:42.152

TWELVE PROCEEDINGS EVERY YEAR --

00:54:02.238 --> 00:54:04.174

STRUCK COMPELLED TO THE BAY

01:09:11.780 --> 01:09:13.716
OVERSTATED BECAUSE OVER THE PAST

01:09:13.782 --> 01:09:14.416
FEW YEARS?

01:09:14.483 --> 01:09:16.252
THERE'S BEEN APPROXIMATELY SEVEN

01:09:16.318 --> 01:09:17.486
MILLION DOLLARS IN ANNUAL

01:09:17.553 --> 01:09:19.688
SAVINGS CORRECTLY IT IS PRETTY

01:09:19.755 --> 01:09:24.827
CLOSE TO THE ABOUT COMING IN.

01:09:24.894 --> 01:09:25.361
AND WE HAVE SEEN A PRETTY

01:09:25.427 --> 01:09:25.961
CONSISTENT INCREASE IN REVENUE

01:09:26.028 --> 01:09:27.329
AND ABOUT TWO MILLION DOLLARS

01:09:27.396 --> 01:09:28.697
ANNUALLY INCREASE IN REVENUE.

01:09:28.764 --> 01:09:29.932
SO THIS SOMETHING THAT WE

01:09:29.999 --> 01:09:31.400
DEFINITELY ARE CONTINUING TO

01:09:31.467 --> 01:09:32.701
MONITOR --

01:09:32.768 --> 01:09:34.403
AND HE VALLEY ON ANNUAL BASIS AT

01:09:34.470 --> 01:09:35.738
THIS POINT --

01:09:35.804 --> 01:09:37.306
YOU KNOW THE FUND IT DOES HAVE

01:09:37.373 --> 01:09:39.875
ABOVE THE MINIMUM RESERVE LEVEL

01:09:39.942 --> 01:09:41.810
AND WE DO THINK IT COULD SUSTAIN

01:09:41.877 --> 01:09:44.914
THIS UP FIVE YEAR COST BUT

01:09:44.980 --> 01:09:46.181
WALKING THROUGH THE VALLEY TO

01:09:46.248 --> 01:09:46.382
FIND.

01:09:46.448 --> 01:09:48.150
TAKES THAT IN THREE FOUR YEARS

01:09:48.217 --> 01:09:49.451
WE SEE YOU KNOW GREATER ISSUE

01:09:49.518 --> 01:09:50.286
THEN WE CAN LOOK AT OTHER

01:09:50.352 --> 01:09:52.187
ALTERNATIVES EITHER BRING DOWN

01:09:52.254 --> 01:09:54.290
THE COST OR SEE WHAT OTHER OTHER

01:09:54.356 --> 01:09:55.424
THINK WE COULD DO TO ADDRESS THE

01:09:55.491 --> 01:09:56.358
ISSUE.

01:09:56.425 --> 01:09:58.060
SO I TRIED TO FOLLOW MOST OF

01:09:58.127 --> 01:09:58.394
THAT -- THAT

01:09:58.460 --> 01:10:00.663
WAS A LOT IN A VERY SHORT PERIOD

01:10:00.729 --> 01:10:05.100
OF TIME BUT YOUR CONCLUSION AS

01:10:05.167 --> 01:10:08.437
THE FIVE YEAR PERIOD OF TIME THE

01:10:08.504 --> 01:10:11.774
FUND WILL NOT GO NEGATIVE --

01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:13.542
IS THAT YOUR CONCLUSION ALSO FOR

01:10:13.609 --> 01:10:14.677
A LONGER TERM.

01:10:14.743 --> 01:10:16.812

01:10:21.617 --> 01:10:22.551
IN THE LONG RUN AT THE GOING TO

01:10:22.618 --> 01:10:24.320
CONTINUE VALLEY ANY MONITORING --

01:10:24.386 --> 01:10:25.955
YOU KNOW IT REALLY DEPENDS ON

01:10:26.021 --> 01:10:27.856
THE REVENUE THE REVENUE KEEP ON

01:11:07.363 --> 01:11:08.998
REQUIRES --

01:11:09.064 --> 01:11:10.666
OFFICIAL WILDLIFE TO TO REVIEW

01:11:10.733 --> 01:11:11.433
THE NOSE OF EXEMPTIONS BUT MY

01:11:11.500 --> 01:11:12.601
UNDERSTANDING IS THAT --

01:11:12.668 --> 01:11:14.103
THE ROLE THE EXAMS AS OUR

01:11:14.169 --> 01:11:15.371
MINISTERIAL SO THAT THEY REQUIRE

01:11:15.437 --> 01:11:17.373
YOUR DEPARTMENTS APPROVAL SO HOW

01:11:17.439 --> 01:11:18.774
DO YOU RECONCILE THE FACT THAT

01:11:18.841 --> 01:11:20.509
THERE'S THE NEED FOR MORE STAFF

01:11:20.576 --> 01:11:21.510
WHEN.

01:11:21.577 --> 01:11:24.647
IN ESSENCE CAL FIRE MAKES THOSE

01:11:24.713 --> 01:11:27.883
DETERMINATIONS NOT FISH WILDLIFE.

01:11:27.950 --> 01:11:29.885

PRODUCTIVE RELATIONSHIP THAT

01:11:33.856 --> 01:11:35.290
ALLOWS US TO MEET MULTIPLE

01:11:35.357 --> 01:11:37.459
OBJECTIVES. ONE OF THOSE STATE

01:11:37.526 --> 01:11:39.528
OBJECTIVES IS PROTECTING PUBLIC

01:11:39.595 --> 01:11:41.430

I HEAR YOUR COMMENT AND EXCEPT

01:11:43.966 --> 01:11:45.501
THE VIEW ABOUT THE MINISTERIAL

01:11:45.567 --> 01:11:46.135
ASPECT [inaudible]

01:11:46.201 --> 01:11:49.438
BUT SB NINE OH ONE CREATES A

01:11:49.505 --> 01:11:52.708
BROAD PUBLIC POLICY ENDEAVOR --

01:11:52.775 --> 01:11:54.943
TO DO THINGS BETTER AND FASTER

01:11:55.010 --> 01:11:56.078
GIVEN THE RISK OF CATASTROPHIC

01:11:56.145 --> 01:11:57.813
FIRE.

01:11:57.880 --> 01:11:59.148
OUR DEPARTMENT PLAYS AN

01:11:59.214 --> 01:12:00.449
IMPORTANT ROLE AS THE STATE'S

01:12:00.516 --> 01:12:02.885
PUBLIC TRUST RESOURCE.

01:12:02.951 --> 01:12:04.620
AGENCY WHEN IT COMES TO STREAM

01:12:04.687 --> 01:12:06.855
CROSSINGS BECOMES A TEMPORARY

01:12:06.922 --> 01:12:08.390
ROAD CONSTRUCTION.

01:12:08.457 --> 01:12:10.225
AND I THINK OUR ABILITY TO

01:12:10.292 --> 01:12:12.027
PARTICIPATE WELL IN THE REGIME

01:12:12.094 --> 01:12:14.196
CREATED BY NINE A ONE IS SOUND

01:12:14.263 --> 01:12:15.364
PUBLIC POLICY.

01:12:15.431 --> 01:12:16.565
SO THE CONCERN THAT I HAVE IS

01:12:16.632 --> 01:12:18.267
THAT IN TERMS OF INSERTING

01:12:18.333 --> 01:12:19.268
ANOTHER DEPARTMENT INTO

01:12:19.334 --> 01:12:21.637
SOMETHING WHERE IT CAL FIRE HAS

01:12:21.704 --> 01:12:23.138
THE AUTHORITY TO APPROVE AND

01:12:23.205 --> 01:12:24.673
THEN DISTRIBUTE THE EXEMPTIONS

01:12:24.740 --> 01:12:26.742
THAT THAT DOES NOT MAKE THINGS

01:12:26.809 --> 01:12:27.476
FASTER.

01:12:27.543 --> 01:12:29.078
HE WOULD YOU GIVE US SOME

01:12:29.144 --> 01:12:30.713
ASSURANCE THAT THESE THINGS

01:12:30.779 --> 01:12:33.115
WOULD PROCEED FASTER AS MR PASS

01:12:33.182 --> 01:12:35.017
INDICATED WILDFIRE PREVENTION IS

01:12:35.084 --> 01:12:36.752
YOU SHOULD BE OUR NUMBER ONE

IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN I

01:12:49.631 --> 01:12:51.500

MONITORING.

01:12:59.241 --> 01:13:02.277
FUNDED FROM THE TIMBER FUND.

YOU'LL SEE IN OUR BUDGET CHANGE

01:13:03.679 --> 01:13:06.115
PROPOSAL A SPECIFIC INTERESTING

INCREASING OUR CAPACITY. FOR

01:13:07.883 --> 01:13:10.419
POST EXEMPTION MONITORING IN

01:13:10.486 --> 01:13:11.987
FACT.

01:13:12.054 --> 01:13:13.722

01:13:23.599 --> 01:13:25.234
MONITORING.

01:13:25.300 --> 01:13:26.902
AND PRE PROJECT CONSULTATION

01:13:26.969 --> 01:13:28.871
GIVEN OTHER EXAMPLE ONE OF THE

01:13:28.937 --> 01:13:30.506
BENEFITS OF NINE OH ONE THAT I

01:13:30.572 --> 01:13:31.840
SEE.

01:13:31.907 --> 01:13:34.009
IS THE ABILITY FOR SMALL TIMBER

01:13:34.076 --> 01:13:37.045
OWNERS TO COME IN TO THE

01:13:37.112 --> 01:13:39.481

01:13:41.216 --> 01:13:43.185
AND SEND THEIR FOREST ON SMALL

01:13:43.252 --> 01:13:44.753
TIMBER PROPERTIES --

01:13:44.820 --> 01:13:48.023
WHICH IS A DIFFERENT --

01:13:48.090 --> 01:13:50.359
OF INVESTMENT FOR SMALL TIMBER

01:13:50.425 --> 01:13:51.560
UNDERSTAND LARGER INDUSTRIAL

01:13:53.262 --> 01:13:55.197
THEIR ABILITY TO DO THAT HINGES

01:13:55.264 --> 01:13:57.099
ON OUR ABILITY TO CONSULT WITH

THEM AND ADVISE THEM.

01:13:58.934 --> 01:14:00.302
SO I THINK THOSE ARE EXAMPLES OF

01:14:00.369 --> 01:14:03.005
IMPROVING THE PROCESS.

01:14:03.071 --> 01:14:04.873
EXPEDITING THE PROCESS WHICH

01:14:04.940 --> 01:14:06.875
SHOULD RESULT IN MORE TEMPERATE

01:14:06.942 --> 01:14:08.277
DEMINING DONE IN THE STATE TO

01:15:53.448 --> 01:15:56.251
UP. TWO MOUNTAIN RANGES AND

01:15:56.318 --> 01:15:58.153
FORESTED LAND.

01:15:58.220 --> 01:15:59.688
OKAY WEBER AT THE END THE DAY

01:15:59.755 --> 01:16:01.456
THE END OR NOT A WINE CAL FIRE

01:16:01.523 --> 01:16:02.724

TWENTY SEVENTEEN I HAVE WE

01:16:17.739 --> 01:16:18.941
HAVEN'T GOTTEN ONE I GUESS FROM

01:16:19.007 --> 01:16:20.909
THE AS THE LEGISLATURE IN TWENTY

01:16:20.976 --> 01:16:21.510
EIGHTEEN WHEN WOULD BE ABLE TO

01:16:21.576 --> 01:16:23.178
SEE THAT.

01:16:23.245 --> 01:16:25.147
I WILL ASK THE RESOURCES AGENCY

01:16:25.213 --> 01:16:28.050
AND WE WILL EXPEDITE THAT REPORT

01:16:28.116 --> 01:16:29.651
TO THIS SUBCOMMITTEE OKAY AND

01:16:29.718 --> 01:16:31.186
THEN TWENTY NINETEEN M. SWIMMING

01:16:31.253 --> 01:16:33.188
IS BEING WORKED ON MY

01:16:33.255 --> 01:16:34.423
UNDERSTANDING I WILL CHECK AND

01:16:34.489 --> 01:16:35.524

GUESS I'M WE'RE SEEING A

01:16:39.795 --> 01:16:40.796
DISTURBING TREND ADDING FROM

01:16:40.862 --> 01:16:41.997
OTHER THAT THAT'S PROBABLY

01:16:42.064 --> 01:16:43.432
SIMILAR TO OTHER AGENCIES WHICH

01:16:43.498 --> 01:16:45.233
IS STAFFING INCREASING THE

01:16:45.300 --> 01:16:47.736
NUMBER OF PLANS APPROVAL PROCESS

01:16:47.803 --> 01:16:49.371
TIME -- OR

01:16:49.438 --> 01:16:50.806
PLANS BEING --

01:16:50.872 --> 01:16:53.709
PLANS DIG DECREASING THE NUMBER

01:16:53.775 --> 01:16:56.878
OF YOU KNOW --

01:16:56.945 --> 01:16:58.413
YOU KNOW IT THE NUMBER OF PLANS

01:16:58.480 --> 01:16:59.648
DO -- THE

01:16:59.715 --> 01:17:00.582
THE TIME THE TIME LINE TO PROVE

01:17:00.649 --> 01:17:01.850
THESE PLANS ARE INCREASING AS

01:17:01.917 --> 01:17:02.985
WELL SO.

01:17:03.051 --> 01:17:04.252
MY CONCERN IS THAT YOUR

01:17:04.319 --> 01:17:05.787
INCREASING STAFF.

01:17:05.854 --> 01:17:08.056
BUT THEN THE TIME TO REVIEW HIS

01:17:08.123 --> 01:17:09.958
WHICH IS IS OFFICE OF A LONGER.

01:17:10.025 --> 01:17:11.226
THE HOPE IS OF COURSE IF YOU

01:17:11.293 --> 01:17:12.828
HIRE MORE STAFF THAT YOU WOULD

01:17:12.894 --> 01:17:16.765
MAKE THINGS FASTER SO --

01:17:16.832 --> 01:17:17.366
CAN YOU CAN YOU RECONCILE THAT

01:17:17.432 --> 01:17:17.666
[inaudible]

01:17:17.733 --> 01:17:19.568
YES.

01:17:19.634 --> 01:17:21.236
I'D LIKE TO LOOK AT THE SAME

01:17:21.303 --> 01:17:23.271
DATA YOU'RE LOOKING AT AND I

01:17:23.338 --> 01:17:24.940
WOULD BE WILLING TO DO THE SAME

01:17:25.007 --> 01:17:26.641
THING WITH THE COMPANIES --

01:17:26.708 --> 01:17:27.909
THE COMPRISE THE CALIFORNIA

01:17:27.976 --> 01:17:29.077
FORESTRY ASSOCIATION THEIR

01:17:29.144 --> 01:17:30.779
LEADERSHIP.

01:17:30.846 --> 01:17:32.481
BECAUSE IT'S NOT ALWAYS OBVIOUS

01:17:32.547 --> 01:17:33.582
TO ME WE'RE SEEING THE SAME

01:17:33.648 --> 01:17:35.017
TREND LINES.

01:17:35.083 --> 01:17:35.917
I THINK WOULD BE VERY

01:17:35.984 --> 01:17:36.618
CONSTRUCTIVE TO HAVE A

01:17:36.685 --> 01:17:38.420
CONVERSATION TO MAKE SURE WE'RE

01:17:38.487 --> 01:17:40.622
LOOKING AT THE SAME DATA.

01:17:40.689 --> 01:17:42.724
WELL THE OTHER RECONCILIATION I

01:17:42.791 --> 01:17:44.159
WOULD MAKE IS.

01:17:44.226 --> 01:17:46.194
SOME OF THE WORK YOU REFERENCE

01:17:46.261 --> 01:17:49.131
IS WORK THAT IS PRE NINE OH ONE

01:17:49.197 --> 01:17:52.100
WORK IT WILL NEED TO CONTINUE.

01:17:52.167 --> 01:17:53.835
FOR TODAY WE'RE FOCUSED ON A

01:17:53.902 --> 01:17:56.772
REQUEST ABOUT HAVING CAPACITYTO

01:17:56.838 --> 01:18:01.143
DO THE NINE OH ONE WORK WELL.

01:18:01.209 --> 01:18:02.878
RIGHT THE NIGHT WHEN WORK IS IS

01:18:02.944 --> 01:18:04.946
BEING ADDED ON AND SO THAT'S I

01:18:05.013 --> 01:18:06.214
GUESS LET ME CLARIFY IT IN TERMS

01:18:06.281 --> 01:18:07.616
OF STAFFING CONTINUES TO GO UP

01:18:07.682 --> 01:18:09.284
NOT A ONE OBVIOUSLY ADDS MORE

01:18:09.351 --> 01:18:10.085
WORK.

01:18:10.152 --> 01:18:11.453
YEAH THE NUMBER OF T. H. P.'S

01:18:11.520 --> 01:18:13.388
APPROVED WENT DOWN THE NUMBER OF

01:18:13.455 --> 01:18:14.489
ACRES BEING TREATED WHICH IS THE

01:18:14.556 --> 01:18:16.091
MOST IMPORTANT PART HAS GONE

01:18:16.158 --> 01:18:17.893
DOWN AND THE TIME IT TOOK TO

01:18:17.959 --> 01:18:19.394
REVIEW THEM WENT UP.

01:18:19.461 --> 01:18:22.597
SO THOSE THOSE TRENDS ARE

01:18:22.664 --> 01:18:23.198
POSITIVE [inaudible]

01:18:23.265 --> 01:18:24.900
CORRECT.

01:18:24.966 --> 01:18:26.401
I WOULD LIKE TO LOOK AT THE SAME

01:18:26.468 --> 01:18:27.436
DATA YOU'RE LOOKING AT AND I

01:18:27.502 --> 01:18:28.804
WILL WELCOME AN ONGOING

01:18:28.870 --> 01:18:30.005
CONVERSATION.

01:18:30.072 --> 01:18:32.274
THIS MAKE SURE WE'RE SEEING THE

01:18:32.340 --> 01:18:34.509
TREND LINES THE SAME BUT THE

01:18:34.576 --> 01:18:36.311
INVESTMENT STAFF SHOULD BE

01:18:36.378 --> 01:18:39.081
PRODUCING FASTER WORK PRODUCT.

01:18:39.147 --> 01:18:41.550
AND DESIRED OUTCOMES SOONER.

01:18:41.616 --> 01:18:42.951
OKAY AND THEN IN TERMS OF YOUR

01:18:43.018 --> 01:18:43.952
VIEW AND MAYBE THE PART FINANCE

01:18:44.019 --> 01:18:45.520
YOU CAN JUMP IN HERE I HEAR THE

01:18:45.587 --> 01:18:46.455
WORDS --

01:18:46.521 --> 01:18:49.157
STRUCTURAL IMBALANCE IS THE FIND

01:18:49.224 --> 01:18:53.462
GOING INSOLVENT.

01:18:53.528 --> 01:18:56.131
SO AT THIS POINT OVER THIS NEXT

01:18:56.198 --> 01:18:57.432
FIVE YEAR PERIOD --

01:18:57.499 --> 01:18:59.067
THAT WE KIND OF LOOK AT AND THE

01:18:59.134 --> 01:19:01.036
PRIZE THEN ADD THE ADDITIONAL

01:19:01.103 --> 01:19:01.970
RESOURCE THE REQUESTING FOR FISH

01:19:02.037 --> 01:19:03.939
AND WILDLIFE ARE OVER THIS FIVE

01:19:04.005 --> 01:19:04.473
YEAR PERIOD.

01:19:04.539 --> 01:19:07.275
IF THE TRENDS CONTINUE AS THEY

01:19:07.342 --> 01:19:09.211
HAVE BEEN WITH THE KIND OF LEVEL

01:19:09.277 --> 01:19:10.679
OF EXPOSURE COMING IN AND THE

01:19:10.745 --> 01:19:11.913
AMOUNT OF REVENUE INCREASING

01:19:11.980 --> 01:19:14.716
EACH YEAR WE SHOULD BE FINE BUT

01:19:14.783 --> 01:19:18.520
IN THE LONG RUN YOU KNOW SEVEN

01:19:18.587 --> 01:19:19.387
EIGHT TEN HEY --

01:19:19.454 --> 01:19:21.756
IT REALLY DOES DEPEND ON THE THE

01:19:21.823 --> 01:19:23.225
LEVEL OF REVENUE THAT CONTINUE

01:19:23.291 --> 01:19:25.227
COMING IN AS A NEW LEVEL EXPAND

01:19:25.293 --> 01:19:26.461
OR SO IF SOMETHING EVER DEFTLY

01:19:26.528 --> 01:19:28.530
COMMITTED TO CONTINUE MONITORING

01:19:28.597 --> 01:19:30.398
AND EVALUATING --

01:19:30.465 --> 01:19:32.234
BUT AT THIS POINT FOR NEXT TWO

01:19:32.300 --> 01:19:34.803
YEARS WE FEEL THAT THE FUND

01:19:34.870 --> 01:19:35.704
COULD SUSTAIN THESE COSTS.

01:19:35.770 --> 01:19:37.739
AND WE'RE DEFINITELY ABOVE THAT

01:19:37.806 --> 01:19:38.874
MADE THEM --

01:19:38.940 --> 01:19:40.442
THRESHOLD IN STATUE WHICH WAS

01:19:40.509 --> 01:19:41.343
IDENTIFIED THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE

01:19:41.409 --> 01:19:42.611
A MINIMUM OF FOUR MILLION

01:19:42.677 --> 01:19:44.513
DOLLARS AT ALL TIMES IN THE FIND

01:19:44.579 --> 01:19:46.314
OUR CURRENTLY AT ELEVEN POINT

01:19:46.381 --> 01:19:47.349
FIVE MILLION DOLLARS.

01:19:47.415 --> 01:19:50.085
BUT IN TERMS OF THE THE THE THE

01:19:50.152 --> 01:19:51.286
STAFF THE STAFF --

01:19:51.353 --> 01:19:52.420
A STAFF ANALYSIS MADE

01:19:52.487 --> 01:19:54.489
EXPENDITURES ARE EXCEEDING

01:19:54.556 --> 01:19:56.525
REVENUES PRETTY SIGNIFICANTLY AT

01:19:56.591 --> 01:19:59.361
THE MAIN THAT'S IT THAT'S

01:19:59.427 --> 01:20:01.596
CORRECT.

01:20:01.663 --> 01:20:02.097
THE DECLARE BY THE THE

01:20:02.164 --> 01:20:03.064
AUTHORIZED LEVEL OF EXPENDITURES

01:20:03.131 --> 01:20:05.500
ARE ABOVE THE ANNUAL REVENUE

01:20:05.567 --> 01:20:07.969
HOWEVER WHEN WE GO BACK AND LOOK

01:20:08.036 --> 01:20:09.538
AT THE ACTUAL LEVEL BECAUSE

01:20:09.604 --> 01:20:10.472
THERE'S AN AUTHORIZED AMOUNT AND

01:20:10.539 --> 01:20:12.574
THEN AFTER THE YEAR AND WE DO

01:20:12.641 --> 01:20:13.408
ACTUAL.

01:20:13.475 --> 01:20:14.709
THEY'RE ACTUALLY COOK A COMING

01:20:14.776 --> 01:20:15.243
IN -- PRETTY

01:20:15.310 --> 01:20:17.312
CONSISTENT AS THOUGH WHEN HE

01:20:17.379 --> 01:20:18.880
JUST THAT'S WHY IT IN MY EARLIER

01:20:18.947 --> 01:20:20.382
COMMENT.

01:20:20.448 --> 01:20:21.016
I MENTIONED THAT THE STRUCTURE

01:20:21.082 --> 01:20:22.551
BALLOT MAY BE OVERSTATED WHEN

01:20:22.617 --> 01:20:23.885
YOU JUST LOOK AT THE LEVEL OF

01:20:23.952 --> 01:20:25.253
AUTHORITY VERSUS LEVEL OF

01:20:25.320 --> 01:20:27.489
REVENUE BECAUSE IN OUR KIND OF

01:20:27.556 --> 01:20:28.156
PREVIOUS AND HEALTH OF THE PAST

01:20:28.223 --> 01:20:28.990
FEW YEARS.

01:20:29.057 --> 01:20:30.258
THE ACTUAL HAVEN'T BEEN COMING

01:20:30.325 --> 01:20:32.661
AND TO THE EXTENT THAT WE HAVE

01:20:32.727 --> 01:20:34.362
BEEN PROJECTING THEM TOO SO IT'S

01:20:34.429 --> 01:20:35.964
ACTUALLY NOT.

01:20:36.031 --> 01:20:37.365
AS MUCH OUT OF THE SPECTRUM

01:20:37.432 --> 01:20:41.870
BALANCED AS YOU WOULD SEE IF YOU

01:20:41.937 --> 01:20:44.039
JUST LOOK AT THE FINE CONDITION

01:20:44.105 --> 01:20:45.106
BALANCE OF THIRTY MILLION

01:20:45.173 --> 01:20:47.709
DOLLARS IN.

01:20:47.776 --> 01:20:48.343
TWENTY SIXTEEN TWENTY SEVENTEEN

01:20:48.410 --> 01:20:49.744
F. N. AND THEN IT'S GONE TO

01:20:49.811 --> 01:20:52.047
ELEVEN BILLION IN --

01:20:52.113 --> 01:20:52.681
TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY TWENTY SO

01:20:52.747 --> 01:20:55.617
THAT'S YOU KNOW A REDUCTION OF

01:20:55.684 --> 01:20:57.252
NINETEEN MILLION DOLLARS.

01:20:57.319 --> 01:20:58.753
SO IN HONOR THAT PATH.

01:20:58.820 --> 01:20:59.554
THAT WOULD BE UNSUSTAINABLE

01:20:59.621 --> 01:21:02.657
CORRECT.

01:21:02.724 --> 01:21:03.191
I'M OUT ALL THOSE NUMBERS

01:21:03.258 --> 01:21:04.693
INCORRECT.

01:21:04.759 --> 01:21:05.961
THAT IN IN A IN A TWO YEAR

01:21:06.027 --> 01:21:07.429
PERIOD WE'VE GONE DOWN NINETEEN

01:21:07.495 --> 01:21:09.297
MILLION DOLLARS.

01:21:09.364 --> 01:21:11.166
I WOULD HAVE TO GO BACK AND LOOK

01:21:11.233 --> 01:21:12.167
AT WHAT WITH SPECIFICALLY

01:21:12.234 --> 01:21:13.735
IDENTIFIED IN THE AGENDA WE

01:21:13.802 --> 01:21:14.569
COULD PROVIDE ADDITIONAL

01:21:14.636 --> 01:21:15.670
INFORMATION FOR YOU HAVE COULD

01:21:15.737 --> 01:21:17.239
SEE WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT WHICH

01:21:17.305 --> 01:21:19.241
LOOK AT THE ACTUAL TRAINS COMING

01:21:19.307 --> 01:21:19.674
IN SO.

01:21:19.741 --> 01:21:21.042
WE COULD DEFINITELY PROVIDE THE

01:21:21.109 --> 01:21:23.878
INFORMATION TO THE STAFF AT THE

01:21:23.945 --> 01:21:24.546
SHARE WITH YOU I APPRECIATE THAT

01:21:24.613 --> 01:21:28.083
AND AT THE END OF MY MY FINAL ON

01:21:28.149 --> 01:21:30.218
I GUESS.

01:21:30.285 --> 01:21:31.419
MY FOR A SURE WINNER I GUESS

01:21:31.486 --> 01:21:32.287
FOCUS ON IS THAT THE AND WE

01:21:32.354 --> 01:21:32.887
WOULD AGREE THAT WE WANT TO

01:21:32.954 --> 01:21:34.856
MAXIMIZE THE AMOUNT OF FUNDS

01:21:34.923 --> 01:21:37.392
GOING INTO GRANTS AND TREATMENT

01:21:37.459 --> 01:21:38.727
OF ACRES NOT STAFF [inaudible]

01:21:38.793 --> 01:21:40.495
CORRECT [inaudible]

01:21:40.562 --> 01:21:42.631
SO.

01:21:42.697 --> 01:21:43.732
AB FOURTEEN NINETY TWO

01:21:43.798 --> 01:21:46.501
IDENTIFIED A LEVEL OF PRIORITIES

01:21:46.568 --> 01:21:47.569
FOR THE FIND AND THAT'S

01:21:47.636 --> 01:21:49.104
CURRENTLY IN STATUTE.

01:21:49.170 --> 01:21:52.107
AND THE PRIORITIES IS FIRST FOR

01:21:52.173 --> 01:21:54.242
THE THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH

01:21:54.309 --> 01:21:56.878
THE DEPARTMENTS TO DO THE REVIEW

01:21:56.945 --> 01:21:58.113
AND PERMITTING PROCESS FEES

01:21:58.179 --> 01:21:59.414
ASSOCIATED WITH THE WITH A

01:21:59.481 --> 01:22:01.249
TIMBER OPERATIONS SO THAT'S THE

01:22:01.316 --> 01:22:03.051
FIRST LEVEL PRIORITY IN STATUTE.

01:22:03.118 --> 01:22:04.653
THE STATUE THAT IDENTIFIES AFTER

01:22:04.719 --> 01:22:06.988
THAT FIRST LEVEL PRIORITY IS MET.

01:22:07.055 --> 01:22:08.323
IF THERE'S FOUR MILLION DOLLARS

01:22:08.390 --> 01:22:10.158
IN THE FUND THEN WE CAN USE THAT

01:22:10.225 --> 01:22:12.861
FOR GRANTS SO THERE IS THERE ARE --

01:22:12.927 --> 01:22:14.562
FUNDING FOR GRANT'S WITHIN THESE

01:22:14.629 --> 01:22:16.665
PROGRAMS WITHIN THE DEPARTMENTS --

01:22:16.731 --> 01:22:18.266
HOWEVER THERE IS DEFINITELY LESS

01:22:18.333 --> 01:22:20.001
BINDING BECAUSE WE ARE FOLLOWING

01:22:20.068 --> 01:22:21.569
THE STATUE WHICH IDENTIFIES THE

01:22:21.636 --> 01:22:24.306
PRIORITY LEVEL FOR THE FUNDS.

01:22:24.372 --> 01:22:25.573
I YEARS WAS A THAT WE WOULD WANT

01:22:25.640 --> 01:22:27.242
TO FLIP THAT THE PRIORITY RIGHT

01:22:27.309 --> 01:22:28.810
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WE

01:22:28.877 --> 01:22:31.846
MINIMIZE THE AMOUNT OF MONEY

01:22:31.913 --> 01:22:34.449
SPENT.

01:22:34.516 --> 01:22:36.217
AND MAXIMIZING THE ENVIRONMENT

01:22:36.284 --> 01:22:37.552
IMPACT IN TERMS OF MAKING SURE

01:22:37.619 --> 01:22:38.586
THESE ACRE MORE ACRES ARE BEING

01:22:38.653 --> 01:22:39.821
TREATED OF THE GRANTS RIGHT WE

01:22:39.888 --> 01:22:41.823
WANT MORE MONEY TO GO OUT TO THE

01:22:41.890 --> 01:22:42.691
GRANT.

01:22:42.757 --> 01:22:46.561
AND LESS TO THE OVERHEAD CORRECT.

01:22:46.628 --> 01:22:48.496
I WOULD OR MISS BY WOULD BE TO

01:22:48.563 --> 01:22:49.097
SEE THAT YOU WANT TO CHIME IN

01:22:49.164 --> 01:22:49.698
HERE TO WHERE WE WANT TO MAKE

01:22:49.764 --> 01:22:49.998
SURE THAT.

01:22:50.065 --> 01:22:52.534
MORE MONEY GOES OUT TWO TO THREE

01:22:52.600 --> 01:22:54.636
ACRES AND NOT REALLY MUCH FOR

01:22:54.703 --> 01:22:55.804
OVERHEAD.

01:22:55.870 --> 01:22:57.572
WELL I DON'T ACCEPT THE PREMISE

01:22:57.639 --> 01:23:00.342
THAT THE GRANTING PRODUCES MORE

01:23:00.408 --> 01:23:02.844
ON THE GROUND RESULTS AND STAFF

01:23:02.911 --> 01:23:03.945
CAPACITY.

01:23:04.012 --> 01:23:06.815
NECESSARILY FOR EXAMPLE.

01:23:06.881 --> 01:23:08.083
OUR DEPARTMENT PROJECTS

01:23:08.149 --> 01:23:10.585
RECEIVING.

01:23:10.652 --> 01:23:14.122
AN ONSLAUGHT OF REQUESTS FOR

01:23:14.189 --> 01:23:15.623
EXEMPTIONS IN EXCEPTIONS.

01:23:15.690 --> 01:23:17.859
WE EXPECT TO HELP CAL FIRE.

01:23:17.926 --> 01:23:19.828
IF WE CAN PROCESS THAT WORKLOAD

01:23:19.894 --> 01:23:20.895
THEN.

01:23:20.962 --> 01:23:22.797
I THINK THE LOGIC FOLLOWS MORE

01:23:22.864 --> 01:23:24.165
PEOPLE WILL BE OUT ON THEIR

01:23:24.232 --> 01:23:26.234
FOREST LANDS DOING PREVENTION

01:23:26.301 --> 01:23:27.369
ACTIVITIES BLACK BUT WE WANT

01:23:27.435 --> 01:23:28.470
MORE MONEY TO GO INTO THE

01:23:28.536 --> 01:23:30.171
PREVENTION ACTIVITIES.

01:23:30.238 --> 01:23:33.074
AND STAFF CAPACITY.

01:23:33.141 --> 01:23:35.443
CAN PRODUCE THAT RESULT AS WELL

01:23:35.510 --> 01:23:38.346
OR BETTER THAN GRANT RESTORATION

01:23:38.413 --> 01:23:40.515
FUNDING.

01:23:40.582 --> 01:23:41.149
SAY THAT AGAIN SO YOU WOULD SAY

01:23:41.216 --> 01:23:43.585
THAT.

01:23:43.651 --> 01:23:45.320
THE THAT STAFFING IS MORE

01:23:45.387 --> 01:23:47.555
IMPORTANT THAN GRANT CAPACITY

01:23:47.622 --> 01:23:47.856
[inaudible]

01:23:47.922 --> 01:23:49.724
YOUR PREMISES.

01:23:49.791 --> 01:23:52.026
USING FOUR MILLION DOLLARS TO

01:23:52.093 --> 01:23:53.695
MAKE DISCREET.

01:23:53.762 --> 01:23:56.998
RESTORATION FUNDING CHOICES.

01:23:57.065 --> 01:24:00.502
WILL PRODUCE MORE LANDSCAPE

01:24:00.568 --> 01:24:01.903
CHANGE DâN.

01:24:01.970 --> 01:24:04.239
DEALING WITH THE INCOMING

01:24:04.305 --> 01:24:06.508
REQUESTS FOR EXEMPTIONS.

01:24:06.574 --> 01:24:07.342
I'M NOT CERTAIN THAT PREMISE

01:24:07.409 --> 01:24:08.877
HOLDS.

01:24:08.943 --> 01:24:10.678
IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE INCOMING

01:24:10.745 --> 01:24:12.180
REQUESTS FOR EXEMPTIONS AND

01:24:12.247 --> 01:24:13.782
EXCEPTIONS THEY'RE GOING TO BE

01:24:13.848 --> 01:24:15.450
ABOUT.

01:24:15.517 --> 01:24:17.085
TRYING TO GET BOOTS ON THE

01:24:17.152 --> 01:24:18.987
GROUND FASTER AND TREATING OUR

01:24:19.053 --> 01:24:21.956
FOREST ACROSS THE WHOLE STATE.

01:24:22.023 --> 01:24:23.758
SO I THINK THERE'S A PRUDENT

01:24:23.825 --> 01:24:26.861
DECISION. TO PREPARE FOR THAT

01:24:26.928 --> 01:24:29.164
WORKLOAD AND RESPOND TO THAT

01:24:29.230 --> 01:24:29.998
WORK LOAD.

01:24:30.064 --> 01:24:33.368
THAT MAY PRODUCE MORE TREATMENT.

01:24:33.435 --> 01:24:35.403
THEN HE SAID A DISCREET GRANT

01:24:35.470 --> 01:24:38.306
FUNDING DECISIONS MAY.

01:24:38.373 --> 01:24:40.074
MAY OKAY I I I I GUESS I DON'T

01:24:40.141 --> 01:24:41.476
HAVE ALL THE NUMBERS I JUST WHEN

01:24:41.543 --> 01:24:43.344
YOU SAY FOR MY AND WE HAVE TO

01:24:43.411 --> 01:24:44.579
MAINTAIN A FOUR MILLION DOLLAR.

01:24:44.646 --> 01:24:47.749
BALANCE CORRECT SO IF THERE'S

01:24:47.816 --> 01:24:49.083
ELEVEN I WOULD WANT THAT SEVEN

01:24:49.150 --> 01:24:51.286
MILLION DOLLARS TO MAKE TO GO

01:24:51.352 --> 01:24:52.821
OUT TO GRANT OR AS MUCH OF IT AS

01:24:52.887 --> 01:24:54.289
POSSIBLE SO THAT WE CAN MAINTAIN

01:24:54.355 --> 01:24:55.557
IT FOR MINOR BALLOTS.

01:24:55.623 --> 01:24:57.158
BUT IF WE ARE GOING TO EAT INTO

01:24:57.225 --> 01:24:59.627
THE FOUR MILLION DOLLAR --

01:24:59.694 --> 01:25:00.862
BALLOTS WE GOTTA MAINTAIN THEN

01:25:00.929 --> 01:25:02.330
WE'RE ACTUALLY GOING.

01:25:02.397 --> 01:25:03.865
TO EXACERBATE.

01:25:03.932 --> 01:25:06.067
THE FUND THAT IS PAID FOR BY

01:25:06.134 --> 01:25:09.437
FEES SO EITHER YOU SOLVE THIS

01:25:09.504 --> 01:25:10.638
INSOLVENCY BY.

01:25:10.705 --> 01:25:11.673
A FEE INCREASE WHICH I'M NOT

01:25:11.739 --> 01:25:13.074
SURE THAT YOU GUYS REPAIRED TO

01:25:13.141 --> 01:25:14.476
TO ENTERTAIN ARE OVER I WOULD

01:25:14.542 --> 01:25:15.410
SUPPORT.

01:25:15.477 --> 01:25:17.111
SO I I GUESS I'M JUST TRYING TO

01:25:17.178 --> 01:25:17.912
MAKE SURE THAT WHEN WE

01:25:17.979 --> 01:25:19.781
PRIORITIZE THINGS THAT WE MAKE

01:25:19.848 --> 01:25:21.783
SURE THAT MORE MONEY GOES OUT TO

01:25:21.850 --> 01:25:23.151
TREATING AREAS AND PREVENTING

01:25:23.218 --> 01:25:24.786
WILDFIRES WHICH IS I THINK THE

01:25:24.853 --> 01:25:26.454
THE THE PRIORITY OF EVERYONE ON

01:25:26.521 --> 01:25:27.222
THIS COMMITTEE.

01:25:27.288 --> 01:25:30.091
AND THEN GOING INTO A DELAYED

01:25:30.158 --> 01:25:31.726
OVERSIGHT --

01:25:31.793 --> 01:25:33.094
WHICH WOULD IS PROBABLY

01:25:33.161 --> 01:25:34.963
UNNECESSARY BECAUSE IT'S

01:25:35.029 --> 01:25:36.898
MINISTERIAL THAT'S I APPRECIATE

01:25:36.965 --> 01:25:39.801

MISTER PATTERSON.

01:25:41.302 --> 01:25:42.337
I JUST QUIT THE FOCUS A BIT ON

01:25:42.403 --> 01:25:44.973
THAT.

01:25:45.039 --> 01:25:48.877
ACCORDING TO OUR REVIEW OF THE

01:25:48.943 --> 01:25:50.645
TWENTY SEVENTEEN REPORT FOR THE

DONE OUT THERE WITH BOOTS ON THE

01:25:59.554 --> 01:26:02.023
GROUND --

01:26:02.090 --> 01:26:03.925
WE'VE ACTUALLY SEEN THAT THAT

01:26:03.992 --> 01:26:07.529
PLAN REVIEWS THIS IS A TWENTY

01:26:07.595 --> 01:26:10.331
SEVENTEEN DECREASED.

01:26:10.398 --> 01:26:12.300
THE NUMBER OF ACRES REVIEWED

01:26:12.367 --> 01:26:14.235
DECREASED.

01:26:14.302 --> 01:26:16.871
FULL TIME STAFF WORKING ON THESE

01:26:16.938 --> 01:26:18.940

HE'S AND A MISSION --

01:29:30.898 --> 01:29:33.634
TO AS SET OUT IN IN SB NINE NO

01:29:33.701 --> 01:29:35.770
ONE AND WE REALLY WANT TO MAKE

01:29:35.837 --> 01:29:37.472
BE ABLE --

01:29:37.538 --> 01:29:39.707
TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT --

01:29:39.774 --> 01:29:43.778
THAT ALL OF THE FIRE UP.

01:29:43.845 --> 01:29:45.046
HELP PROTECTION --

01:29:45.113 --> 01:29:47.849
AND AND FOREST RESILIENCY ISSUES

01:29:47.915 --> 01:29:49.317
ARE ADDRESSED BUT IN A

01:29:49.383 --> 01:29:51.152
RESPONSIBLE WAY THAT DOESN'T

01:29:51.219 --> 01:29:53.588
HAVE UNINTENDED ADVERSE --

01:29:53.654 --> 01:29:55.590
CONSEQUENCES TO OTHER POP --

01:29:55.656 --> 01:29:58.392
IMPORTANT PUBLIC RESOURCES.

01:29:58.459 --> 01:29:59.227
SO SINCE --

01:29:59.293 --> 01:30:00.895
THE ACTIVITIES THAT ARE

01:30:00.962 --> 01:30:02.830
AUTHORIZED AND REQUIRED --

01:30:02.897 --> 01:30:04.499
UNDER SB NINE NO ONE WILL

01:30:04.565 --> 01:30:06.100
SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE LAND

01:30:06.167 --> 01:30:08.169
MANAGEMENT AND DISTURBANCE --

01:30:08.236 --> 01:30:09.203
ACTIVITIES.

01:30:09.270 --> 01:30:12.640
THERE ARE.

01:30:12.707 --> 01:30:14.475
IT'S HARD TO KNOW HOW MUCH BUT

01:30:14.542 --> 01:30:15.409
THERE ARE SOME POTENTIAL

01:30:15.476 --> 01:30:17.645
SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS. TO WATER

01:30:17.712 --> 01:30:19.413
QUALITY ACROSS THE STATE'S

01:30:19.480 --> 01:30:20.515
THIRTY THREE MILLION ACRES OF

01:30:20.581 --> 01:30:21.649
FOREST LAND.

01:30:21.716 --> 01:30:23.651
AND FORTY THREE THOUSAND MILES

OF UTILITY CORNER COURT

01:30:25.753 --> 01:30:26.554
CORRIDORS.

01:30:26.621 --> 01:30:27.722
SO THESE GROUND DISTURBING

01:30:27.789 --> 01:30:28.656
ACTIVITIES --

01:30:28.723 --> 01:30:29.957
WILL -- WILL

01:30:30.024 --> 01:30:31.626
OCCUR IN SOME OF THE STATE'S

01:30:31.692 --> 01:30:33.828
MOST IMPORTANT AND PRODUCTIVE

SOURCE WATERSHEDS.

01:30:35.396 --> 01:30:37.198
AND THE WORK CONDUCTED HAS THE

01:30:37.265 --> 01:30:39.333
POTENTIAL TO INCREASE SETTLEMENT

01:30:39.400 --> 01:30:41.135
AND PESTICIDE DISCHARGES INTO

01:30:41.202 --> 01:30:45.173
WATERS OF THE STATE. TO ALTER

01:30:45.239 --> 01:30:46.674
FOREST AND STREAM CHANNEL

01:30:46.741 --> 01:30:47.975
HYDROLOGY --

01:30:48.042 --> 01:30:49.410
POTENTIALLY INCREASING AND

01:30:49.477 --> 01:30:50.578
CONCENTRATING --

01:30:50.645 --> 01:30:53.481
STORM WATER RUNOFF RESULTING IN

01:30:53.548 --> 01:30:55.016
EROSION --

01:30:55.082 --> 01:30:56.684
AND SEDIMENT DISTRICT JUSTICE TO

01:30:56.751 --> 01:30:58.319

DOWNSTREAM INFRASTRUCTURE

01:30:59.887 --> 01:31:02.323
INCLUDE INCLUDING ROADS AND

01:31:02.390 --> 01:31:03.524
WATER SOURCE CROSSINGS --

01:31:03.591 --> 01:31:05.026
AND DESTRUCTION CHEMICALS IN THE

01:31:05.092 --> 01:31:06.527

SLOPE OF THE SURFACE WATERS.

01:31:11.833 --> 01:31:13.234
SO SUCH DISCHARGES --

01:31:13.301 --> 01:31:14.669
DO HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO IMPACT

01:31:14.735 --> 01:31:16.170
BENEFICIAL USES OF THE STATE'S

01:31:16.237 --> 01:31:17.572
WATER -- FOR

01:31:17.638 --> 01:31:19.307
EXAMPLE INCREASING SEDIMENTATION

01:31:19.373 --> 01:31:21.042
CAN DIRECTLY IMPACT THE HEALTH

01:31:21.108 --> 01:31:22.877
OF QUITE XP SEES.

01:31:22.944 --> 01:31:24.612
AN AQUATIC HABITATS --

01:31:24.679 --> 01:31:25.580
INCREASE --

01:31:25.646 --> 01:31:28.916
INCREASING WATER TEMPERATURES

01:31:28.983 --> 01:31:30.484
CAN CREATE HUMAN HEALTH HAZARDS

01:31:30.551 --> 01:31:31.786
INCLUDING --

01:31:31.853 --> 01:31:35.022
THOSE FROM HARMFUL ALGAL BLOOMS.

01:31:35.089 --> 01:31:36.757
AND IT'S POSSIBLE THAT CLEAN

01:31:36.824 --> 01:31:38.926
DRINKING WATER SUPPLIES CAN BE --

01:31:38.993 --> 01:31:40.061
THREATENED OR COMPROMISE THROUGH

01:31:40.127 --> 01:31:41.262
INCREASED SETTLEMENT AND

01:31:41.329 --> 01:31:42.830
INTRODUCTION OF CHEMICAL

01:31:42.897 --> 01:31:45.933
CONTAMINANTS --

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:47.802
UP BECAUSE OF THE ACTIVITIES

01:31:47.869 --> 01:31:49.136
AUTHORIZED UNDER --

01:31:49.203 --> 01:31:51.572
SB NINE A ONE THE WATER BOARD

01:31:51.639 --> 01:31:53.107
WILL NEED TO DEVELOP A NEW

01:31:53.174 --> 01:31:55.309
STATEWIDE GENERAL ORDER --

01:31:55.376 --> 01:31:56.677
FOR OF WASTE JUST TRY TO

01:31:56.744 --> 01:31:58.346
REQUIREMENTS FOR CONSTRUCTION

01:31:58.412 --> 01:31:59.780
AND MAINTENANCE OF UTILITY CORPS

01:31:59.847 --> 01:32:01.315
OF CORRIDORS AND ASSOCIATED

01:32:01.382 --> 01:32:02.617
ACCESS ROADS.

01:32:02.683 --> 01:32:03.918
AND WE WILL HAVE TO ESTABLISH A

01:32:03.985 --> 01:32:05.353
SYSTEM FOR CONDUCTING FIELD

01:32:05.419 --> 01:32:07.021
INSPECTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH

01:32:07.088 --> 01:32:09.590
UTILITY QUARTERS AND MAINTENANCE.

01:32:09.657 --> 01:32:10.491
AND THEN WE'LL HAVE TO INCREASE

01:32:10.558 --> 01:32:12.126
SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE THE

01:32:12.193 --> 01:32:13.794
NUMBER OF FIELDS INSPECTIONS

01:32:13.861 --> 01:32:18.566
ASSOCIATED WITH TIMBER HARVEST --

01:32:18.633 --> 01:32:21.068
THE TIMBER HARVEST AN EXEMPTION --

01:32:21.135 --> 01:32:22.403
BECAUSE THERE'S GOING TO BE A

01:32:22.470 --> 01:32:24.472
LOT MORE TEMPORARY ROAD BUILDING

01:32:24.538 --> 01:32:29.143
AND WITH NO PRE APPROVAL --

01:32:29.210 --> 01:32:33.247
SO WE'RE GOING TO NEED --

01:32:33.314 --> 01:32:35.249
TO AM RATIONAL INSPECTION SYSTEM

01:32:35.316 --> 01:32:36.784
TO MAKE SURE THAT THE THE

01:32:36.851 --> 01:32:37.752
POTENTIAL --

01:32:37.818 --> 01:32:39.787
HARMS TO WATER SOURCES THAT I

01:32:39.854 --> 01:32:40.121
MENTIONED --

01:32:40.187 --> 01:32:42.056
DO NOT OCCUR A MOST OF THE

01:32:42.123 --> 01:32:43.624
POSITIONS THAT WERE ASKING FOR

01:32:43.691 --> 01:32:47.595
THE VAST MAJORITY WILL BE --

01:32:47.662 --> 01:32:49.430
WOULD BE --

01:32:49.497 --> 01:32:50.431
SEARCHED OUT TWO OF THE REGIONAL

01:32:52.667 --> 01:32:54.435
OCCUR THERE FOR MEAN FOR

01:32:54.502 --> 01:32:56.437
REGIONAL WATER PORTS IN WHICH

01:32:56.504 --> 01:32:59.173
99% OF THE TIMBER --

01:32:59.240 --> 01:33:00.374
TIMBERLANDS OCCUR SO THAT'S

01:33:00.441 --> 01:33:01.375
WHERE -- WE

01:33:01.442 --> 01:33:03.444
WOULD DEPLOY THE INSPECTION

01:33:03.511 --> 01:33:04.946

REGULATORY PROCESS AND THERE'S

01:39:37.705 --> 01:39:40.207

WE THINK THERE'S ALSO AN NUMBER

01:40:09.403 --> 01:40:11.505
AS I'M OVERSIGHT QUESTIONS FOR

01:40:11.572 --> 01:40:12.940
THE LONGER TERM BEYOND JUST

FOREST HEALTH AND AND PREVENTING

01:40:24.618 --> 01:40:26.253
CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES.

01:40:27.321 --> 01:40:28.155
TO MEASURE AND IT'S GOING TO BE

01:40:28.222 --> 01:40:28.789
SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE GOING TO

01:40:28.856 --> 01:40:30.290
WANT TO THINK ABOUT OVER THE

01:40:30.357 --> 01:40:31.959
LONGER TERM AND SO.

01:40:32.025 --> 01:40:33.427
MAKING SURE THAT THE

THEIR GOALS.

01:40:47.641 --> 01:40:49.243
AND WE THINK THAT THERE'S

01:40:49.309 --> 01:40:50.778
ADDITIONAL OVERSIGHT QUESTIONS

01:40:50.844 --> 01:40:52.446

PRIORITIES --

01:41:32.286 --> 01:41:33.754

YOU'RE TRYING TO HAVE FIFTEEN

01:47:59.639 --> 01:48:01.341

WE'RE TALKING ABOUT --

01:48:37.744 --> 01:48:38.945
IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO SEE THE

01:48:39.012 --> 01:48:40.113
EIGHTEEN IN NINETEEN REPORT SO

01:48:40.180 --> 01:48:41.281
WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT THOSE

01:48:41.348 --> 01:48:42.782
TRENDS ARE BEING CORRECTED --

01:48:42.849 --> 01:48:43.884

PROPOSING TO SPEND --

01:49:05.105 --> 01:49:06.773
FIVE OR SIX MILLION DOLLARS MORE

01:49:06.840 --> 01:49:08.174
THAN WE HAVE COMING IN AND

01:49:08.241 --> 01:49:09.242
REVENUES --

01:49:09.309 --> 01:49:10.610
SO IF THAT TREND WILL CONTINUE

01:49:10.677 --> 01:49:12.212
OUR CONCERN IS THAT THE

01:49:12.279 --> 01:49:13.980
FOLLOWING YEAR WE ACTUALLY MIGHT

01:49:14.047 --> 01:49:15.715
BE AT OR BELOW THAT FOUR MILLION

01:49:15.782 --> 01:49:16.650
DOLLAR MARK.

01:49:16.716 --> 01:49:17.951
EVEN MORE CONCERNING THEN THAT

01:49:18.018 --> 01:49:19.386
IS THE FACT THAT MOST OF THAT

01:49:19.452 --> 01:49:21.087
MONEY IS BEING SPENT ON STAFF

01:49:21.154 --> 01:49:22.789
WHICH IS A LONGER GOING --

01:49:22.856 --> 01:49:25.292
PROCESS AND CONTINUING PROCESS.

01:49:25.358 --> 01:49:26.593
AS OPPOSED TO SPENDING DOWN A

01:49:26.660 --> 01:49:30.297
RESERVE ON ONE TIME GRANTS --

01:49:30.363 --> 01:49:31.932
FINALLY WERE CONCERNED THAT IN

01:49:31.998 --> 01:49:33.133
THE JUSTIFICATION OF THE B. C.

01:49:33.199 --> 01:49:35.802
P. IT SAYS THAT SB NINE OH ONE

01:49:35.869 --> 01:49:37.437
REQUIRES FISH AND WILDLIFE TO

01:49:37.504 --> 01:49:38.939
REVIEW THESE EXEMPTIONS.

01:49:39.005 --> 01:49:40.840
AND AS AS WE'VE CLARIFIED TODAY

01:49:40.907 --> 01:49:42.742
THESE EXEMPTIONS ARE MINISTERIAL

01:49:42.809 --> 01:49:44.277
THEY DON'T REQUIRE THE REVIEW OR

01:49:44.344 --> 01:49:46.012
APPROVAL --

01:49:46.079 --> 01:49:48.481
IN FACT SB NINE A ONE REQUIRES --

01:49:48.548 --> 01:49:49.983
CAL FIRE TO RECEIVE THE

01:49:50.050 --> 01:49:51.885
MINISTERIAL DOCUMENT THEY IN

01:49:51.952 --> 01:49:53.219
TURN SEND IT OUT TO THE

01:49:53.286 --> 01:49:55.021
REMAINING DEPARTMENTS --

01:49:55.088 --> 01:49:56.957
UNLESS OF A CAL FIRE IS THE ONE

01:49:57.023 --> 01:49:58.992
THAT DETERMINES IF THE DOCUMENTS

01:49:59.059 --> 01:50:00.527
ARE ACCURATE AND COMPLETE --

01:50:00.593 --> 01:50:02.095
BUT IT IS MINISTERIAL AND DOES

01:50:02.162 --> 01:50:04.731
NOT REQUIRE THEIR APPROVAL --

01:50:04.798 --> 01:50:06.800
IF FISH AND WILDLIFE WAS LOOKING

01:50:06.866 --> 01:50:08.635
AT INCREASING THE MONITORING --

01:50:08.702 --> 01:50:10.337
ASSOCIATED WITH THESE EXEMPTIONS

01:50:10.403 --> 01:50:11.271
I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE

01:50:11.338 --> 01:50:12.339
WOULD BE INTERESTED IN AND

01:50:12.405 --> 01:50:14.040
CONSIDERING HOWEVER.

01:50:14.107 --> 01:50:15.575
AGAIN --

01:50:15.642 --> 01:50:18.445
WHEN TALKING ABOUT THE WE LOOKED

01:50:18.511 --> 01:50:19.879
AT TWENTY EIGHTEEN TO TRY AND

01:50:19.946 --> 01:50:21.648
GET A BASELINE OF HOW MUCH WORK

01:50:21.715 --> 01:50:22.849
THESE DEPARTMENTS OF THESE

01:50:22.916 --> 01:50:24.484
REGIONS ALREADY HAD CONSIDERING

01:50:24.551 --> 01:50:25.752
THEY WERE LOOKING AT HIRING TO

01:50:25.819 --> 01:50:27.354
NEW FULL TIME POSITION?

01:50:27.420 --> 01:50:30.090
TO NEW POSITIONS FOR THIS IN

01:50:30.156 --> 01:50:30.690
TWENTY EIGHTEEN BETWEEN THOSE

01:50:30.757 --> 01:50:32.859
TWO REGIONS THEY HAD A TOTAL OF

01:50:32.926 --> 01:50:35.395
ONE EXEMPTION. ONE LESS THAN

01:50:35.462 --> 01:50:37.163
THREE ACRE CONVERSION AND ZERO

01:50:37.230 --> 01:50:39.232
TIMBER HARVEST PLANTS AND SO FOR

01:50:39.299 --> 01:50:42.135
US IF THEY WERE LOOKING AT AREAS

01:50:42.202 --> 01:50:44.104
THE REGIONS THAT HAVE THE MOST --

01:50:44.170 --> 01:50:45.772
ACTIVITY IN OUR INDUSTRY AND

01:50:45.839 --> 01:50:47.374
WANTED TO HIRE ADDITIONAL ONE

01:50:47.440 --> 01:50:49.142
PERSON FOR EACH OF THOSE REGIONS

01:50:49.209 --> 01:50:51.177
THAT WOULD MAKE MORE SENSE TO US --

01:50:51.244 --> 01:50:53.013
BUT THOSE ARE THOSE CONCERNS

01:50:53.079 --> 01:50:59.652
THAT WE HAVE THANK YOU.

01:50:59.719 --> 01:51:01.955

DEFENDERS OF WILDLIFE CALIFORNIA

01:51:11.297 --> 01:51:11.831
PLANS TO CITING HALF OF THE

01:51:11.898 --> 01:51:13.566
DOZEN OTHER NGOS.

01:51:13.633 --> 01:51:16.403
AND ALL LARGELY BE TRACKING

01:51:16.469 --> 01:51:17.904
ALONG THOSE SAME ISSUES --

01:51:17.971 --> 01:51:19.039
THOSE A VERY DENSE HEARING THIS

01:51:19.105 --> 01:51:19.672
MORNING A LOT OF INFORMATION I

01:51:19.739 --> 01:51:20.840
WILL TRY AND SPEAK TO ALL THE

01:51:20.907 --> 01:51:21.408
THINGS THAT WE SUPPORT BUT

01:51:21.474 --> 01:51:22.675
RATHER.

01:51:22.742 --> 01:51:23.676
FLY SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE

01:51:23.743 --> 01:51:24.277
THINK.

01:51:24.344 --> 01:51:26.746
DESERVE A LITTLE MORE ATTENTION.

01:51:26.813 --> 01:51:28.381
I WILL NOTE THAT WHERE ARE MY

01:51:28.448 --> 01:51:29.649
ORGANIZATION FRANKLY ALL THOSE

01:51:29.716 --> 01:51:31.317
ORGANIZATIONS ARE SUPPORTIVE OF

01:51:31.384 --> 01:51:33.486
THE TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS --

01:51:33.553 --> 01:51:34.554
BEING APPROPRIATE FOR THE MORE

01:51:34.621 --> 01:51:35.722
SALT AND FIRE PREVENTION

01:51:35.789 --> 01:51:37.791
PROGRAMS AND TO BE USED IN THE

01:51:37.857 --> 01:51:39.692
WAY THAT IT WAS USED IN THE PAST

01:51:39.759 --> 01:51:40.860
I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT.

01:51:40.927 --> 01:51:42.262
THAT WE MAINTAIN SOME STABILITY

01:51:42.328 --> 01:51:45.732
AND HOW ARE USING CAN BUILD WORK

01:51:45.799 --> 01:51:48.034
FORCES AND BUSINESSES THAT ARE

01:51:48.101 --> 01:51:49.602
ACTUALLY EXECUTING THIS WORKING

01:51:49.669 --> 01:51:50.503
NOT.

01:51:50.570 --> 01:51:54.274
WAITING AROUND HERE TO YEAR --

01:51:54.340 --> 01:51:55.642
WE ARE SUPPORTIVE OF THE THE

01:51:55.708 --> 01:51:57.410
CPUS FROM DFW AND THE WATER

01:51:57.477 --> 01:52:00.046
BOARD TO MONITOR THE

01:52:00.113 --> 01:52:02.148
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE THE

01:52:02.215 --> 01:52:04.050
VARIOUS VEGETATION MANAGEMENT

01:52:04.117 --> 01:52:05.218
ACTIVITIES AND THAT'S BEEN ON A

01:52:05.285 --> 01:52:06.653
ONE OR SOMETHING THAT WE ASK.

01:52:06.719 --> 01:52:08.354
FOR IN THOSE DISCUSSIONS.

01:52:08.421 --> 01:52:10.123
I WILL FLAG I THINK THAT IT'S

01:52:10.190 --> 01:52:12.158
ALSO IN A GOOD OPPORTUNITY FOR

01:52:12.225 --> 01:52:14.727
US TO NOT JUST BE LOOKING AT THE

01:52:14.794 --> 01:52:16.062
ACTIVITIES THAT HAVE ALREADY

01:52:16.129 --> 01:52:17.664
BEEN PROPOSED ARE HAPPENING BUT

01:52:17.730 --> 01:52:20.700
BE MORE PROACTIVE AND USE THIS

01:52:20.767 --> 01:52:23.203
AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO DRAW.

01:52:23.269 --> 01:52:25.205
THE DIFFERENT MANAGEMENT --

01:52:25.271 --> 01:52:26.406
AGENCIES ARE REVIEW TEAM

01:52:26.473 --> 01:52:28.641
AGENCIES TOGETHER TO PROACTIVELY

01:52:28.708 --> 01:52:29.876
LOOK AT WATERSHEDS IDENTIFY

01:52:29.943 --> 01:52:31.411
THOSE AREAS THAT ARE THE HIGHEST

01:52:31.478 --> 01:52:32.545
PRIORITY --

01:52:32.612 --> 01:52:34.514
SO THEY WERE TARGETING THOSE AND

01:52:34.581 --> 01:52:35.815
REALLY TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH

01:52:35.882 --> 01:52:37.684
BROADER WATERSHED HEALTH GOALS

01:52:37.750 --> 01:52:38.985
AS PART OF THESE ACTIVITIES AND

01:52:39.052 --> 01:52:40.320
NOT BEING ENTIRELY.

01:52:40.386 --> 01:52:42.222
REACTIVE AND JUST LOOKING AT

01:52:42.288 --> 01:52:43.223
THINGS AFTER THE FACT SO I THINK

01:52:43.289 --> 01:52:44.624
THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE

01:52:44.691 --> 01:52:45.892
COMMITTEE.

01:52:45.959 --> 01:52:48.561
TO PROVIDE SOME ADDITIONAL

01:52:48.628 --> 01:52:49.863
GUIDANCE TO THOSE BCP'S.

01:52:49.929 --> 01:52:50.497
AND I WANT TO FOCUS IN ON WHAT I

01:52:50.563 --> 01:52:51.030
THINK ARE THE TWO BIGGEST

01:52:51.097 --> 01:52:52.232
CONCERNS AND I APPRECIATE THE

01:52:52.298 --> 01:52:53.099
CHAIR RAISING THESE --

01:52:53.166 --> 01:52:55.101
WITH REGARDS TO THOSE TWO

01:52:55.168 --> 01:52:56.369
PROVISIONS THAT DIRECT THE AIR

01:52:56.436 --> 01:52:58.304
RESOURCES BOARD. TO DO

01:52:58.371 --> 01:52:59.572
ACTIVITIES THAT ARE GONNA BE

01:52:59.639 --> 01:53:01.274
ABSOLUTELY FOUNDATIONAL TO THE

01:53:01.341 --> 01:53:04.244
SUCCESS OF THIS BROADER PROGRAM.

01:53:04.310 --> 01:53:05.578
IF YOU TALK TO ANYBODY WHO HAS

01:53:05.645 --> 01:53:06.946
BEEN INVOLVED IN THE YOU KNOW

01:53:07.013 --> 01:53:08.481
VARIOUS FUELS REDUCTION

01:53:08.548 --> 01:53:09.315
ACTIVITIES OVER THE LAST FEW

01:53:09.382 --> 01:53:11.851
YEARS THEY WILL UNDOUBTEDLY

01:53:11.918 --> 01:53:12.986
COMPLAIN ABOUT THE

01:53:13.052 --> 01:53:14.754
QUANTIFICATION METHODOLOGIES.

01:53:14.821 --> 01:53:16.422
FOR HOW WE GO ABOUT DOING THAT

01:53:16.489 --> 01:53:17.924
IT HAS BEEN THERE'S THERE'S ROOM

01:53:17.991 --> 01:53:18.691
FOR IMPROVEMENT THERE.

01:53:18.758 --> 01:53:23.763
AND THERE'S THAT OR A LESS RIGHT

01:53:23.830 --> 01:53:25.298
WAY TO DO THAT ARE YOU KNOW.

01:53:25.365 --> 01:53:27.033
IF AIR WE DOESN'T HAVE RESOURCES

01:53:27.100 --> 01:53:28.601
TO DO THAT WELL WE'RE NOT GOING

01:53:28.668 --> 01:53:30.236
TO END UP WITH A GOOD SYSTEM WE

01:53:30.303 --> 01:53:31.704
MIGHT END UP WITH A SYSTEM BUT

01:53:31.771 --> 01:53:32.639
IT WON'T BE THE SYSTEM THAT

01:53:32.705 --> 01:53:35.041
WOULD REALLY HELP US FACILITATE.

01:53:35.108 --> 01:53:37.043
THE TYPE OF THE SCALE OF WORK

01:53:37.110 --> 01:53:38.545
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AND HAVING

01:53:38.611 --> 01:53:40.280
TO INTEGRATE WELL INTO THE REST

01:53:40.346 --> 01:53:42.515
OF OUR ACCOUNTING WORK THE A. R.

01:53:42.582 --> 01:53:43.183
B. AS ALREADY DOING AND DOING SO

01:53:43.249 --> 01:53:43.816
WELL.

01:53:43.883 --> 01:53:44.817
I THINK IT'S REALLY WILL BE

01:53:44.884 --> 01:53:46.319
PENNY WISE AND POUND FOOLISH TO

01:53:46.386 --> 01:53:48.855
NOT PROVIDE THEM WITH SOME

01:53:48.922 --> 01:53:50.456
RESOURCES TO DO A GOOD JOB --

01:53:50.523 --> 01:53:51.925
STREAMLINING THE QUANTIFICATION

01:53:51.991 --> 01:53:54.894
METHODS FOR THE FUEL REDUCTION

01:53:54.961 --> 01:53:55.428
ACTIVITIES.

01:53:55.495 --> 01:53:56.729
THE OTHER IS ESTABLISHING A

01:53:56.796 --> 01:53:58.431
CREDIBLE BASELINE FOR WHAT SORT

01:53:58.498 --> 01:54:00.466
OF EMISSIONS LOSING FROM FIRE IN

01:54:00.533 --> 01:54:02.135
CALIFORNIA HISTORICALLY.

01:54:02.202 --> 01:54:03.736
THAT PUTS ALL OF WHAT WE'RE

01:54:03.803 --> 01:54:05.838

SIGNIFICANCE OF YOU KNOW.

01:54:17.183 --> 01:54:18.184
WHAT SORT OF FIRE MISSIONS WE'RE

01:54:18.251 --> 01:54:19.652
SEEING RIGHT NOW?

01:54:19.719 --> 01:54:21.154
AS WE'RE MOVING FORWARD --

01:54:21.221 --> 01:54:22.455

CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THAT.

01:54:30.530 --> 01:54:33.199
BASELINE OF EMISSIONS IS UNDER

THAT'S AN INTEGRAL PART OF THAT --

01:54:43.443 --> 01:54:45.345
THE PENNY WISE AND POUND FOOLISH

01:54:45.411 --> 01:54:46.846

THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS THAT MAY

OR MAY NOT EXIST --

01:59:41.440 --> 01:59:42.475
FOR PREVENTING THE KIND OF

01:59:42.542 --> 01:59:43.476
CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES ALWAYS UP

01:59:43.543 --> 01:59:45.077
IN PARADISE WHERE THERE YOU KNOW

THAT COULD.

02:09:29.828 --> 02:09:31.730
SORT OF HINDER TRANSPARENCY IN

02:09:39.338 --> 02:09:40.172
THE PAST WOULD HAVE BEEN

02:09:40.239 --> 02:09:42.007
SEPARATE ISSUES ARE SEPARATE

02:09:42.074 --> 02:09:43.442

02:10:23.749 --> 02:10:25.250
MAYBE SOMEWHAT PROBLEMATIC JUST

02:10:25.317 --> 02:10:26.552

02:10:34.560 --> 02:10:36.161
NOT AN IDEAL WAY TO DO THINGS.

02:10:36.228 --> 02:10:37.896
AND THAT THE LACK OF INFORMATION

02:10:37.963 --> 02:10:39.731
WAS PARTICULARLY PROBLEMATIC

02:10:39.798 --> 02:10:41.633

02:10:48.540 --> 02:10:50.776
OUTSTANDING QUESTIONS ON THAT.

02:10:50.842 --> 02:10:52.211
ON THE FUNDING FOR THE SEA WHEN

02:10:52.277 --> 02:10:55.080

RECEIVING FOR FREE FROM THE

02:11:02.054 --> 02:11:02.921
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.

02:11:02.988 --> 02:11:04.489
BUT WILL HAVE CONSIDERABLE COSTS

02:11:04.556 --> 02:11:05.524
IN THE TENS OF MILLIONS OF

02:11:05.591 --> 02:11:07.426

WE FEEL ACCURATELY.

02:12:26.672 --> 02:12:28.340

THANK YOU JUST A QUICK COMMENT --

02:17:31.276 --> 02:17:34.479
ON THE ISSUE OF OF FIRE FIGHTING

02:17:34.546 --> 02:17:35.480
AIRCRAFT --

02:17:35.547 --> 02:17:36.781
I HAD A CONVERSATION WITH US

02:17:36.848 --> 02:17:38.350
SOMEONE RECENTLY WHO WAS QUITE

02:17:38.416 --> 02:17:40.552
KNOWLEDGEABLE ON THE ON THE

02:17:40.619 --> 02:17:41.987
OVERALL TOPIC --

02:17:42.053 --> 02:17:46.524
AND IT WAS OBSERVED THAT THERE

02:17:46.591 --> 02:17:47.692
NO --

02:17:47.759 --> 02:17:50.862
FIREFIGHTING SPECIFIC AIRCRAFT

02:17:50.929 --> 02:17:53.765
ANYWHERE AND EVERYTHING LIKE THE

02:17:53.832 --> 02:17:54.532
AIRCRAFT YOU'RE JUST TALKING

02:17:54.599 --> 02:17:56.668
ABOUT -- HAS

02:17:56.735 --> 02:17:58.770
TO BE RETROFITTED --

02:17:58.837 --> 02:18:01.439
AND TO THE DISCUSSION THAT

02:18:01.506 --> 02:18:04.175
ENSUED WAS --

02:18:04.242 --> 02:18:04.909
WHETHER IT WOULD BE MORE

02:18:04.976 --> 02:18:06.878
EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT TO FIND

02:18:06.945 --> 02:18:11.116
A WAY -- TO

02:18:11.182 --> 02:18:12.817
ORDER -- AND

02:18:12.884 --> 02:18:15.754
CREATE A A AN AIRCRAFT THAT IS

02:18:15.820 --> 02:18:17.656
SPECIFIC TO SOME OF THE VERY

02:18:17.722 --> 02:18:19.457
SPECIFIC TASKS AT THE FIRE

02:18:19.524 --> 02:18:20.492
SERVICE HAS --

02:18:20.558 --> 02:18:22.527
SO I PUT THAT OUT THERE NOT FOR

02:18:22.594 --> 02:18:25.096
TOPIC OF DISCUSSION TODAY BUT

02:18:25.163 --> 02:18:30.835
SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT I THINK --

02:18:30.902 --> 02:18:33.772
CALIFORNIA IS NOT THE ONLY PLACE --

02:18:33.838 --> 02:18:35.473
THAT IS SEEING INCREASED FIRE

02:18:35.540 --> 02:18:36.775
RISK -- WE

02:18:36.841 --> 02:18:38.376
KNOW THAT'S GOING TO CONTINUE ON

02:18:38.443 --> 02:18:42.047
INTO THE FUTURE THERE ARE PLACES --

02:18:42.113 --> 02:18:44.683
AS FAR FROM US IS --

02:18:44.749 --> 02:18:47.652
PORTUGAL AND AUSTRALIA IN THE

02:18:47.719 --> 02:18:48.553
UNITED STATES AND AROUND THE

02:18:48.620 --> 02:18:50.355
WORLD THAT --

02:18:50.422 --> 02:18:51.990
ACTUALLY COULD CREATE A MARKET

02:18:52.057 --> 02:18:54.025
PLACE -- FOR

02:18:54.092 --> 02:18:56.161
A FIRE SPECIFIC IT'S THIS IS

02:18:56.227 --> 02:18:57.128
SOMETHING THAT WOULD PROBABLY

02:18:57.195 --> 02:18:58.730
REQUIRE THE COOPERATION OF THE

02:18:58.797 --> 02:19:00.298
MILITARY IN SOME WAY.

02:19:00.365 --> 02:19:03.101
BUT SOMETHING TO PONDER AND

02:19:03.168 --> 02:19:04.636
THINK ABOUT AND WONDER WHETHER --

02:19:04.703 --> 02:19:07.172
THAT MIGHT TO OVERTIME INCREASE

02:19:07.238 --> 02:19:12.610
OUR OUR EFFECTIVENESS.

02:19:12.677 --> 02:19:17.148
AND SO IT UP ON HIS RACE DID I

02:19:17.215 --> 02:19:18.650
MISS YOU I APOLOGIZE I DID.

02:19:18.717 --> 02:19:19.684
MISS PETERS --

02:19:19.751 --> 02:19:20.585
WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE?

02:19:20.652 --> 02:19:21.753
THE ASSESSMENT THE LONG TERM

02:19:21.820 --> 02:19:23.455
ASSESSMENT.

02:19:23.521 --> 02:19:25.824
HOW DO YOU SEE THIS --

02:19:25.890 --> 02:19:28.326
SPECIFIC REQUESTS COMING THROUGH --

02:19:28.393 --> 02:19:29.694
WHO IS AT THE SHOULD PUT IT

02:19:29.761 --> 02:19:32.263
TOGETHER WHO SHOULD OVERSEE IT?

02:19:32.330 --> 02:19:34.332
HOW OFTEN SHOULD BE REVIEWED

02:19:34.399 --> 02:19:36.334
WHAT ARE YOU ENVISIONING?

02:19:36.401 --> 02:19:38.770
SURE SO AND WE WOULD ACTUALLY

02:19:38.837 --> 02:19:41.005
RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE

02:19:41.072 --> 02:19:42.774
REQUIRED THE ASSESSMENT RATHER

02:19:42.841 --> 02:19:43.875
THAN JUST RELYING ON THE

02:19:43.942 --> 02:19:45.777
MINISTRATION TO DO IT OF ITS OWN

02:19:45.844 --> 02:19:47.612
VOLITION THAT WAY YOU HAVE --

02:19:47.679 --> 02:19:48.913
THE ABILITY TO HAVE INPUT IN

02:19:48.980 --> 02:19:51.349
TERMS OF WHAT GOES INTO IT AND

02:19:51.416 --> 02:19:52.951
THE TIME LINES AS AND WHEN IT

02:19:53.017 --> 02:19:54.652
COMES BACK TO YOU --

02:19:54.719 --> 02:19:55.653
THAT YOU HAVE YOU KNOW DIFFERENT

02:19:55.720 --> 02:19:57.722
OPTIONS FOR HOW YOU CAN REQUIRE

02:19:57.789 --> 02:19:59.290
REPORTS AND THE SUPPLEMENTAL

02:19:59.357 --> 02:20:00.525
LANGUAGE REPORT THAT GOES ALONG

02:20:00.592 --> 02:20:03.128
WITH THE BUDGET IS IS ONE OPTION.

02:20:03.194 --> 02:20:07.398
AND AND WE THINK THAT THE HIGHER

02:20:07.465 --> 02:20:09.901
BUT IN IN COORDINATION A WITH

02:20:09.968 --> 02:20:11.402
THE OFFICE THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE

02:20:11.469 --> 02:20:13.238
OF EMERGENCY SERVICES --

02:20:13.304 --> 02:20:15.140
AGAIN FOR THE REASON THAT WHILE

02:20:15.206 --> 02:20:17.675
IT CALIFORNIA HAS AB YOU KNOW A

02:20:17.742 --> 02:20:18.610
LOT OF THIS IS UNDER THEIR

02:20:18.676 --> 02:20:19.477
PURVIEW.

02:20:19.544 --> 02:20:21.146
AND WE WE DO THINK THAT THE

02:20:21.212 --> 02:20:22.714
ASSESSMENT SHOULD REALLY LOOK AT

02:20:22.781 --> 02:20:25.150
HOW CALIFORNIA RESOURCES AS WELL

02:20:25.216 --> 02:20:27.519
AS MUTUAL AID SYSTEM SINCE WHEN

02:20:27.585 --> 02:20:29.654
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT RESPONDING

02:20:29.721 --> 02:20:31.689
TO AND SMALL FIRES AND CERTAINLY

02:20:31.756 --> 02:20:32.657
VERY LARGE FIRES.

02:20:32.724 --> 02:20:34.559
AND IT'S NOT JUST CAL FIRE

02:20:34.626 --> 02:20:36.928
RESOURCES EVEN IF THE FIRE IS ON

02:20:36.995 --> 02:20:38.129
THE STATE RESPONSIBILITY AREA

02:20:38.196 --> 02:20:39.798
THAT THAT WE'RE OFTENTIMES

02:20:39.864 --> 02:20:40.999
ACTIVATING THAT.

02:20:41.065 --> 02:20:44.002
DOT MUTUAL AID SYSTEM AND SO.

02:20:44.068 --> 02:20:45.804
ON JUST THINKING ABOUT AT WHAT

02:20:45.870 --> 02:20:46.971
WHERE THE RESOURCES ARE GOING TO

02:20:47.038 --> 02:20:48.606
BE THE MOST EFFECTIVE OR THE

02:20:48.673 --> 02:20:50.241
MOST COST EFFECTIVE WILL HAVING

02:20:50.308 --> 02:20:51.342
THAT HOLISTIC PICTURE SO WE

02:20:51.409 --> 02:20:52.610
THINK THAT THE REQUIREMENTS

02:20:52.677 --> 02:20:54.045
SHOULD BE ON CAL FIRE.

02:20:54.112 --> 02:20:55.079
AND THAT THAT THEY ALSO

02:20:55.146 --> 02:20:56.548
COORDINATE WITH --

02:20:56.614 --> 02:20:58.349
YES AND WE LAY OUT IN OUR AND IN

02:20:58.416 --> 02:21:00.618
OUR REPORT SPECIFIC THINGS THAT

02:21:00.685 --> 02:21:02.387
WE THINK SHOULD BE LOOKED AT THE

02:21:02.453 --> 02:21:03.488
CAPACITY.

02:21:03.555 --> 02:21:05.456
GAPS IN CAPACITY LOOKING AT ALL

02:21:05.523 --> 02:21:07.091
DIFFERENT TYPES OF OF

02:21:07.158 --> 02:21:08.593
FIREFIGHTING RESOURCES SO FIRE

02:21:08.660 --> 02:21:11.563
ENGINES AND AN AIRCRAFT AND THEY

02:21:11.629 --> 02:21:13.965
CAME UP IN A JOINT HEARING LAST

02:21:14.032 --> 02:21:16.901
WEEK LOOKING AT TECHNOLOGY AND

02:21:16.968 --> 02:21:18.036
WHITE RENO ROLLED IS THERE FOR

02:21:18.102 --> 02:21:19.671
EXAMPLE THE CAMERAS THAT ARE

02:21:19.737 --> 02:21:20.438
PROPOSED IN THE BUDGET.

02:21:20.505 --> 02:21:25.376
AND AND AND ENSURE THIS IS SORT

02:21:25.443 --> 02:21:29.948
OF A APPROACH AND TO ADDRESS

02:21:30.014 --> 02:21:32.116
SAYING ADDRESSING WILDFIRES

02:21:32.183 --> 02:21:33.651
LOOKING FORWARD AND AND WE'D BE

02:21:33.718 --> 02:21:35.186
HAPPY TO IT SORT OF WORK WITH

02:21:35.253 --> 02:21:36.788
YOU ON THE SPECIFICS OF WHAT

02:21:36.855 --> 02:21:37.889
MIGHT GO INTO.

02:21:37.956 --> 02:21:39.324
REQUIRE YOU KNOW THAT YOU WOULD

02:21:39.390 --> 02:21:40.525
WANT TO HAVE REQUIRED AND NOT

02:21:40.592 --> 02:21:41.726
ASSESSMENT AND WE DO THINK THE

02:21:41.793 --> 02:21:43.294
PRIORITIZATION AND LINKING IT

02:21:43.361 --> 02:21:44.863
BACK TO GOALS IS IMPORTANT THERE

02:21:44.929 --> 02:21:46.130
HAVE BEEN SOME ASSESSMENTS THAT

02:21:46.197 --> 02:21:47.332
HAVE BEEN PUT OUT.

02:21:47.398 --> 02:21:50.568
I'M SEVERAL YEARS BACK THAT AND

02:21:50.635 --> 02:21:51.903
ARE MAYBE MORE OF JUST A SURVEY

02:21:51.970 --> 02:21:54.873
OF YOU KNOW WHAT DO FOLKS WANT --

02:21:54.939 --> 02:21:57.175
AS OPPOSED TO HAVING AS AS YOU

02:21:57.242 --> 02:21:58.943
KNOW THAT FISCAL LOOK AT IT AS

02:21:59.010 --> 02:22:01.646
WELL IF OKAY WELL WHAT DO WE

02:22:01.713 --> 02:22:02.780
WHAT DO WE REALLY NEED AND IN

02:22:02.847 --> 02:22:04.382
WHAT AREAS AND AND HOW DOES THAT

02:22:04.449 --> 02:22:06.084
HELP US ACHIEVE SPECIFIC GOALS

02:22:06.150 --> 02:22:07.986
HOW IS BACK IN AND IMPROVE THE

02:22:08.052 --> 02:22:09.687
ABILITY IN A FIRE.

02:22:09.754 --> 02:22:12.123
RESPONSE TIMES AND OR HOW WAS I

02:22:12.190 --> 02:22:14.259
CAN APPROVE IMPROVE THE ABILITY

02:22:14.325 --> 02:22:15.860
TO HANDLE MULTIPLE LARGE AND

02:22:15.927 --> 02:22:17.362
WILD FIRE INCIDENTS THAT ARE

02:22:17.428 --> 02:22:20.999
HAPPENING IN DIFFERENT AREAS OF

02:22:21.065 --> 02:22:22.700
THE STATE AT THE SAME TIME.

02:22:22.767 --> 02:22:24.035
IT CHIEF EARLIER WE TALKED ABOUT --

02:22:24.102 --> 02:22:24.769
ONE OF MY QUESTIONS EARLIER

02:22:24.836 --> 02:22:27.538
ABOUT HAVING THE THE LONG TERM

02:22:27.605 --> 02:22:29.274
PLAN -- AND

02:22:29.340 --> 02:22:31.576
GOES ALONG WITH THE ASSESSMENT

02:22:31.643 --> 02:22:33.645
IS A SOMETHING THAT IS ALREADY

02:22:33.711 --> 02:22:36.147
BEING IMPLEMENTED.

02:22:36.214 --> 02:22:38.383
IS THIS SOMETHING THAT.

02:22:38.449 --> 02:22:42.086
WHERE ARE WE ON THEM?

02:22:42.153 --> 02:22:42.854
GREAT QUESTION MEMBER IS WHERE

02:22:42.921 --> 02:22:43.721
WE ARE IS JUST STARTING WITH OUR

02:22:43.788 --> 02:22:45.590
WITH OUR ASSESSMENT IT'S PART OF

02:22:45.657 --> 02:22:48.192
OUR STRATEGIC PLAN THAT JUST

02:22:48.259 --> 02:22:48.493
ROLLED OUT.

02:22:48.559 --> 02:22:49.928
LAST MONTH.

02:22:49.994 --> 02:22:52.830
OF FOR THE COMING OF FIVE YEARS.

02:22:52.897 --> 02:22:56.901
AND SO WE ARE STARTING ON THAT --

02:22:56.968 --> 02:22:58.670
WE HAVE NOT LAUNCHED YET --

02:22:58.736 --> 02:23:00.371
BUT I DO WANT --

IT SHOULDN'T DO THAT IN MARIN

02:49:39.035 --> 02:49:41.137

02:49:41.204 --> 02:49:44.007
THIS REQUEST IS --

02:49:44.073 --> 02:49:46.543
IS RELATED TO AN AGREEMENT

TO HAVE A PROPORTIONAL --

02:49:51.981 --> 02:49:54.851

IS AND IT'S A LIKE FOR LIKE --

02:50:02.825 --> 02:50:04.694

SO -- THE

02:50:09.532 --> 02:50:10.433
THREE POINT THREE MILLION

02:50:10.500 --> 02:50:12.068
DOLLARS --

02:50:12.135 --> 02:50:14.137
IT WOULD BE ADJUSTED --

02:50:14.203 --> 02:50:16.339
BASED ON THAT 19% OF WHAT CAL

02:50:16.406 --> 02:50:17.440
FIRES --

02:50:17.507 --> 02:50:19.008

AND THAT IS WHAT OUR

02:50:20.143 --> 02:50:21.878
RECOMMENDATION AND AND WHAT --

02:50:21.945 --> 02:50:25.181
IT MEETS THE METHOD ALL SET UP

02:50:25.248 --> 02:50:26.649
IN AGREEMENT WITH THE SIX

02:50:26.716 --> 02:50:31.120
CONTRACT COUNTIES.

02:50:31.187 --> 02:50:32.622
THANK YOU QUESTIONS [inaudible]

02:50:32.689 --> 02:50:35.391
OHIO [inaudible]

02:50:35.458 --> 02:50:37.493
AND SO.

02:50:37.560 --> 02:50:39.929
WE THINK THAT IT'S REASONABLE TO

02:50:39.996 --> 02:50:41.197
CONSIDER GIVING I'M CAPITAL A

02:50:41.264 --> 02:50:42.865
FUNDING TO THE CONTRACT COUNTY

02:50:42.932 --> 02:50:43.733
SUBCONTRACT COUNTIES ARE

02:50:43.800 --> 02:50:45.468
PROVIDING A SERVICE TO CAL FIRE

02:50:45.535 --> 02:50:47.737
AND HAVING FIRE STATIONS AND

02:50:47.804 --> 02:50:49.939
OTHER FACILITIES IS NECESSARY IN

02:50:50.006 --> 02:50:51.507
ORDER FOR THEM TO PROVIDE THE

02:50:51.574 --> 02:50:52.442
SERVICES.

02:50:52.508 --> 02:50:53.710
ON THE FUNDING OF FOR THIS

02:50:53.776 --> 02:50:55.411
PURPOSE HAVE I WAS ELIMINATED IN

02:50:55.478 --> 02:50:57.280
THAT TWELVE THIRTEEN BUDGET AND

02:50:57.347 --> 02:50:59.582
SO HASN'T BEEN PROVIDED FOR THE

02:50:59.649 --> 02:51:01.517
BETTER PART OF THE LAST DECADE --

02:51:01.584 --> 02:51:02.919
IF IT'S A PRIORITY FOR THE

02:51:02.986 --> 02:51:04.454
LEGISLATURE AS YOU'RE PUTTING

02:51:04.520 --> 02:51:06.089
TOGETHER YOUR OVERALL GENERAL

02:51:06.155 --> 02:51:07.557
FUND PRIORITIES TO REINSTATE THE

02:51:07.624 --> 02:51:09.025
SPENDING WE DO THINK IT'S YOU

02:51:09.092 --> 02:51:10.426
KNOW IT'S A REASONABLE AND

02:51:10.493 --> 02:51:11.694
APPROPRIATE.

02:51:11.761 --> 02:51:14.063
AND THOUGH THE FORMULA AND THAT

02:51:14.130 --> 02:51:16.132
THE ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING

02:51:16.199 --> 02:51:18.635
TO REINSTATE THOUGH WE FIND IT

02:51:18.701 --> 02:51:20.003
DOESN'T REALLY TRACK WITH WHAT

02:51:20.069 --> 02:51:21.404
THE NEEDS ARE.

02:51:21.471 --> 02:51:22.538
AND THERE'S ACTUALLY A LOT OF

02:51:22.605 --> 02:51:24.040
VARIABILITY IN THE FUNDING FOR

02:51:24.107 --> 02:51:25.575
THAT SO HOW THAT FORMULA THAN A

02:51:25.642 --> 02:51:27.176
PLACE OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS.

02:51:27.243 --> 02:51:28.478
THE ANNUAL AMOUNT OF FUNDING

02:51:28.544 --> 02:51:30.813
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN PROVIDED

02:51:30.880 --> 02:51:31.481
FOR CAPITAL OUTLAY FOR CONTRACT

02:51:31.547 --> 02:51:34.717
COUNTIES WOULD HAVE RANGED FROM

02:51:34.784 --> 02:51:35.385
NINETY SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS IN

02:51:35.451 --> 02:51:37.086
ONE YEAR TO BE SPLIT AMONGST THE

02:51:37.153 --> 02:51:38.388
SIX COUNTIES.

02:51:38.454 --> 02:51:39.622
SO NOT VERY MUCH --

02:51:39.689 --> 02:51:41.457
IT TO A HIGH OF NINE POINT THREE

02:51:41.524 --> 02:51:43.226
MILLION DOLLARS IN THE HIGHEST

02:51:43.292 --> 02:51:44.427
YEAR AND THIS IS BECAUSE THE WAY

02:51:44.494 --> 02:51:45.461
THE FORMULA WORKS AS A

02:51:45.528 --> 02:51:47.130
PERCENTAGE BUT IT'S A PERCENTAGE

02:51:47.196 --> 02:51:50.333
BASED ON THE CAPITAL OUTLAY

02:51:50.400 --> 02:51:53.970
EXPENDITURES. FOR CALIFORNICA LE

02:51:54.037 --> 02:51:57.306
HERE AND SO CONSTRUCTION AND THE

02:51:57.373 --> 02:51:59.308
SAME YEAR THAT'S GOING TO BE A

02:51:59.375 --> 02:52:01.544
VERY SORT OF HI TAKE THAT AMOUNT

02:52:01.611 --> 02:52:03.079
TAKE 19% OF THAT.

02:52:03.146 --> 02:52:05.782
VERSES AND A YEAR WHERE MAYBE

02:52:05.848 --> 02:52:06.916
CAL FIRE JUST HAPPENS TO HAVE

02:52:06.983 --> 02:52:08.618
NOT NOT ANY PROJECT STARTING

02:52:08.685 --> 02:52:09.919
CONSTRUCTION HAPPENED ALL BE IN

02:52:09.986 --> 02:52:11.654
A DESIGN PHASE FOR THE COSTS ARE

02:52:11.721 --> 02:52:12.388
LOWER.

02:52:12.455 --> 02:52:13.656
I AND SO THIS CAN CREATE A LOT

02:52:13.723 --> 02:52:14.991
OF VARIABILITY IN THE FUNDING

02:52:15.058 --> 02:52:16.459
AND THAT COULD COMPLICATE AND

02:52:16.526 --> 02:52:17.493
THE ABILITY FOR CONTRACT

02:52:17.560 --> 02:52:19.295
COUNTIES TO PLAN FOR USING THAT

02:52:19.362 --> 02:52:20.096
FUNDING.

02:52:20.163 --> 02:52:21.798
AND AND IT'S JUST NOT REALLY

02:52:21.864 --> 02:52:23.966
TIED TO ANY ACTUAL CAPITAL

02:52:24.033 --> 02:52:25.535
OUTLAY NEEDS.

02:52:25.601 --> 02:52:27.136
AND THE SO WE WOULD KNOW THAT

02:52:27.203 --> 02:52:29.439
IT'S PROBABLY NOT COST EFFECTIVE

02:52:29.505 --> 02:52:31.074
TO GET THE INFORMATION TO

02:52:31.140 --> 02:52:32.975
ACTUALLY TRACK WHAT THE SPECIFIC

02:52:33.042 --> 02:52:34.210
NEEDS ARE KIDS IT'S QUITE

02:52:34.277 --> 02:52:35.945
COMPLICATED YOU HAVE LOCAL FIRE

02:52:36.012 --> 02:52:37.113
STATIONS THAT ARE SERVING

02:52:37.180 --> 02:52:38.514
MULTIPLE PURPOSES.

02:52:38.581 --> 02:52:40.116
BOTH AND DOING THE CONTRACT

02:52:40.183 --> 02:52:41.050
COUNTY WORK ON STATE

02:52:41.117 --> 02:52:42.685
RESPONSIBILITY AREAS AS WELL AS

02:52:42.752 --> 02:52:45.922
LOCAL RESPONSIBILITIES AND AND

02:52:45.988 --> 02:52:46.823
SO.

02:52:46.889 --> 02:52:47.390
AND IT MIGHT NOT REALLY BE

02:52:47.457 --> 02:52:48.124
PRUDENT TO TRY TO GET THE

02:52:48.191 --> 02:52:49.692
INFORMATION TO HAVE SOME SORT OF

02:52:49.759 --> 02:52:51.260
NEEDS BE BASED APPROACH.

02:52:51.327 --> 02:52:52.895
AND SO WE THINK THAT MAYBE JUST

02:52:52.962 --> 02:52:54.063
A SIMPLER APPROACH OF PICKING

02:52:54.130 --> 02:52:55.431
AMOUNT AND SET THAT AMOUNT IF

02:52:55.498 --> 02:52:56.799
YOU WANT TO PROVIDE THIS FUNDING

02:52:56.866 --> 02:52:58.301
AND THAT WAY YOU CAN PROVIDE A

02:52:58.367 --> 02:53:00.103
STABLE LEVEL OF FUNDING AND FROM

02:53:00.169 --> 02:53:01.771
EACH YEAR.

02:53:01.838 --> 02:53:03.806
AND TO ADD A POINT THAT I KNOW --

02:53:03.873 --> 02:53:04.907
THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCES

02:53:04.974 --> 02:53:06.976
INDICATE IN THE PAST AS WELL IF

02:53:07.043 --> 02:53:08.945
THE STATE IS IN A POSITION TO

02:53:09.011 --> 02:53:10.012
SHUT OFF OUR CAPITAL OUTLAY

02:53:10.079 --> 02:53:10.847
FUNDING BECAUSE OF BUDGET

02:53:10.913 --> 02:53:12.648
CONSTRAINTS YOU COULD ALWAYS DO

02:53:12.715 --> 02:53:13.916
THE SAME THING EVEN IF YOU.

02:53:13.983 --> 02:53:15.451
SET A SPECIFIC AMOUNT.

02:53:15.518 --> 02:53:17.453
AND HOW YOU CHOOSE THAT AMOUNT

02:53:17.520 --> 02:53:18.287
YOU COULD PICK THE AMOUNT THE

02:53:18.354 --> 02:53:19.455
GOVERNOR'S BUT IN THE BUDGET FOR

02:53:19.522 --> 02:53:20.590
THIS YEAR WHICH IS THE THREE

02:53:20.656 --> 02:53:22.325
POINT THREE MILLION WE LOOKED AT

02:53:22.391 --> 02:53:23.559
WHAT THAT FUNDING WOULD HAVE

02:53:23.626 --> 02:53:25.762
BEEN OVER THE LAST ROUGHLY TEN

02:53:25.828 --> 02:53:27.296
YEARS THE AVERAGE OF THAT SPOT

02:53:27.363 --> 02:53:28.464
TWO POINT TWO MILLION --

02:53:28.531 --> 02:53:29.499
OR YOU CAN PICK SOME OTHER

02:53:29.565 --> 02:53:30.767
AMOUNT THAT YOU'RE YOU'RE

02:53:30.833 --> 02:53:32.068
COMFORTABLE WITH AND YOU COULD

02:53:32.135 --> 02:53:33.970
ALWAYS SET UP A PROCESS.

02:53:34.036 --> 02:53:36.706
TO HAVE IT --

02:53:36.773 --> 02:53:40.243
INCREASE AND WITH CHANGE AND SO

02:53:40.309 --> 02:53:41.244
THE REASONABLE IF IT'S ONE OF

02:53:41.310 --> 02:53:42.578
YOUR PRIORITIES BUT WE THINK

02:53:42.645 --> 02:53:43.613
THERE'S PROBABLY A SIMPLER WAY

02:53:43.679 --> 02:53:47.517
TO PROVIDE FUNDING.

02:53:47.583 --> 02:53:48.518
