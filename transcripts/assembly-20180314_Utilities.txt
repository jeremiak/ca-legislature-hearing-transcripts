GOOD AFTERNOON WERE LIKE TO GET STARTED WITH OUR. FOR MAY SHOW HERE AND I'D LIKE TO WELCOME ALL OF YOU. TO THE UTILITY AND ENERGY COMMITTEE OUGHT TO AND THEY WERE GOING TO BE EXPLORING AND HAVING ADDITIONAL CONVERSATION AROUND THE ISSUES A REGIONAL ENERGY MARKETS IN CALIFORNIA'S GREEN GOALS. AS MANY OF YOU KNOW THIS ISSUE HAS BEEN. AROUND FOR AWHILE. THAT AFTER THE PASSAGE OF SB THREE FIFTY OF THEIR WAS A A DIRECTION TO START LOOKING AT EXPLORING REGIONAL MARKETS AND GREATER DETAIL. UNDER THAT. INITIATIVE AND WE HAVE SEEN THIS ISSUE BRING ITS. ARE WILL RAISE UP AT VARIOUS TIMES SINCE THEN. LAST YEAR AS WE ALL KNOW. THE CALIFORNIA. I AND. KAI SO I WAS INVOLVED IN THE US CONVERSATIONS OF THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE WAS INVOLVING CONVERSATIONS THIS COMMITTEE. A HELD A HEARING START TO EXPLORE THE ISSUE OF REALIZATION AND. AT THE END OF SESSION THERE WAS A BILL. OF THAT. FACILITATED. SOME STRATEGIES AND IDEAS AROUND REGIONALIZATION OF THAT CAME FORWARD AT THE END OF SESSION. WE RECOGNIZE THAT. AN ISSUE OF SUCH MAGNITUDE REQUIRED A LITTLE BIT MORE CONVERSATION. AND TRANSPARENCY AND SO WE'VE INITIATED THAT. CONVERSATION THIS YEAR UNDER. AB A THIRTEEN ARE AS WE. GO FORWARD WITH THIS A HEARING TODAY IT'S ENVISIONED THAT THE CONVERSATION WILL. OPERATE ON A BROADER SCALE BUT ALSO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK AT THE. OF THE CONTOURS OF AB EIGHT THIRTEEN AND HOW IT IS AT THIS POINT LOOKING TO ADDRESS. MANY OF THE ISSUES THAT A BEEN REYES WE'VE HAD A NUMBER OF PUBLIC INFORMATION. SESSIONS STAKEHOLDER GROUP I SHOULD SAY OUR CONVERSATIONS AROUND THE BILL TO TAKE INPUT. AND SO WE'RE A LOOKING FORWARD TO CONTINUING THAT PART OF THE PROCESS. AND MAKING THIS IS TRANSPARENT. A AN EFFORT AS WE POSSIBLY CAN AND TAKE AS MUCH INPUT AS WE POSSIBLY CAN. ABOUT TODAY. IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US ALL TO HAVE. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION PRESENTED ON THIS SUBJECT. I SHOULD THAT BILL MOVE. IT WILL STILL TAKE. A PROCESS IN TIME FOR TO MAKE ITS WAY BACK TO THIS HOUSE IN THE COMMITTEE AND SO WE THOUGHT IT ALSO WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO GIVE EVERYONE AN UPDATE. ON THE SUBJECT AND SO THAT'S WHY WE'RE CONVENING THIS HEARING TODAY. I'M GOING TO INTRODUCE OUR FIRST PANEL WE HAVE A NUMBER OF. WE HAVE AT LEAST TWO PANELS THAT WERE GOING TO CALL ON TODAY THEN WILL HAVE. PUBLIC COMMENT OUR WE WILL TAKE THREE MINUTES A PUBLIC COMMENT FOR EACH PERSON OR AND OR GROUP OR INDIVIDUAL REPRESENTING A GROUP. AND THEN AS I SAY AS OF BEING AN INFORMATIONAL HEARING THERE WILL BE OPPORTUNITIES FOR. THE COMMITTEE A TO ASK QUESTIONS OF THE MEMBERS OF THE PANEL AND IT'S THE PREROGATIVE OF. THE COMMITTEE IF THEY WOULD LIKE TO. ASK A QUESTION OF SOMEONE WHO MAY BE A PUBLIC SPEAKER A BUT WE WILL SEE HOW MANY OF YOU WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN THAT WILL SORT OF A GAUGE. A HOW WE PROCEED FROM THAT POINT BUT IF I COULD IF I'D LIKE TO CALL FORWARD OUR FIRST PANEL THAT WILL BE ADDRESSING THE ISSUE A GRID. MANAGEMENT TRENDS. PERSPECTIVES ON THE NEED FOR REGIONALIZATION AND A. B. A THIRTEEN FROM THE CALIFORNIA INDEPENDENT SYSTEMS OPERATOR. OF OUR FIRST THAT PANEL WILL CONSIST OF MARK ROTH LETTER. VICE PRESIDENT MARKET QUALITY AND RENEWABLE INTEGRATION. AND PHILIP. PETTING GILL DIRECTOR OF REGIONAL INTEGRATION. SO WE CAN HAVE YOU COME FORWARD. OF. YOU SURE CARE. THANK YOU MISTER. BRINGING HIMSELF. PORTANTINO ARE A. YOUR IT IT IS WORK YOUR LIFE NOW OKAY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR BRINGING US UP TO THIS VERY IMPORTANT HEARING. I KNOW A NUMBER OF PEOPLE ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT. CALIFORNIA LOSING. IT'S. SAY OVER WHAT WE DO LOCALLY. I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT THE PEOPLE WERE LOOKING AT WORKING WITH ARE JUST AS WORRIED ABOUT GETTING IN BED WITH THE EIGHT HUNDRED POUND GORILLA CALLED CALIFORNIA. I AM CERTAIN THAT WHATEVER AGREEMENT IS HERE. WE WILL BE ABLE TO MAY MAINTAIN OUR RESPONSIBILITIES FOR MEETING ARE TWENTY THIRTY TWENTY FORTY TWENTY FIFTY GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION GOALS. DOES MEAN THAT THESE OTHER STATES MIGHT WANT TO DO CALL OR SOMETHING ELSE. THAT WE'LL BE THEIR RESPONSIBILITY I KNOW WERE ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT JOBS AND WE DON'T WANT TO EXPORT JOBS TO OTHER STATES THAT. COULD BE THINGS COULD BE BETTER DONE HERE AGAIN THE PEOPLE THAT WE WILL WORK WITH WILL HAVE THE SAME CONCERNS. AND I AM CONVINCED THAT WE CAN COME UP WITH A FAIR WAY OF DOING THIS THANK YOU. ADDRESS QUIRK SEMESTER THANK YOU UP DID VERY VERY QUICKLY ABOUT PREACHING EVERYBODY BEING HERE REALLY APPRECIATE ABOUT THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE DEPTH. THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT THIS. AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT THE CHAIRS LEADERSHIP IN THIS AND I LOOK FORWARD TO GOOD INFORMATION. AT AN OPEN TRANSPARENT THAT PROCESS AND HOPEFULLY GETTING TO SOME DECISIONS THAT ACTUAL WILL IN INCREASE. RELIABILITY FLATTEN COSTS AND AND PERHAPS. ACTUALLY. ENCOURAGE OTHERS TO TAKE A LOOK AT HOW CALIFORNIA'S DOING ITS ELECTRICITY LOTTA GOOD POSSIBILITIES HERE BUT THERE ARE WARNING SIGNS ALONG THE WAY AND I THINK WE NEED TO LISTEN TO ALL OF THOSE. BECAUSE INSTEAD OF THEM SO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN FOR FOR CONVENING THIS. TOTAL. THANK YOU. CHAIR HOLDEN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. MY NAME'S PHIL PATTON GO ON THE DIRECTOR FOR REGIONALLY GRATION AT THE CALIFORNIA I ALSO. AND WANT TO THANK YOU FOR HOLDING THE HEARING TODAY AND MOST IMPORTANT A APPRECIATE YOUR CONSIDERATION FOR GREATER REGIONAL COLLABORATION AND WE CERTAINLY BECAUSE IT WILL WE BELIEVE IT WILL HELP ADVANCE CALIFORNIA'S CLEAN ENERGY GOALS. SO MY COLLEAGUE MARK ROUGHLY AND I ARE GOING TO. WALK THROUGH A FAIR AMOUNT OF INFORMATION FOR YOU TODAY AND YOU WILL GET TO THE SLIDE DECK WHEN I HANDED OFF TO MARK. BUT I WANTED TO MAKE A FEW OPENING REMARKS AND IN SHORT WE'RE HERE TODAY BECAUSE THE REGIONAL GRADE WILL BE GOOD FOR CALIFORNIA. AND TO THAT END WE'RE HERE TO PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF WHAT WE DO THE I SO. DISCUSS WHAT ARE SOME OF THE OPERATIONAL EXPERIENCES AND CHALLENGES THAT WE'VE ALREADY SEEN AND WHERE WE SEE THINGS GOING. AND MORE IMPORTANTLY JUST EXPLAIN HOW A REGIONAL COLLABORATION MULTI STATE DIET SO CAN CERTAINLY HELP MEET CALIFORNIA'S ONGOING GREEN ENERGY GOALS. AND SO BY WAY OF BACKGROUND I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE WE UNDERSTAND THAT AND I ALSO LEAST DECIDED SO IS A NOT FOR PROFIT ENTITY. WERE PUBLIC BENEFIT CORPORATION. AND WE WORK UNDER THE JURISDICTION OF THE FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION. BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY WHAT WE DO IS WE APPLY NATIONAL RELIABILITY STANDARDS IN OPERATING BUILD IT UP AND SERVING ABOUT EIGHTY PERCENT OF THE LOAD. HEARING CALIFORNIA AND PROVIDED RELIABLE ELECTRIC SERVICE TO THOSE THOSE CONSUMERS HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. ONE OF THINGS WE'VE DONE OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS IS CALIFORNIA'S MADE GREAT STRIDES IN IMPLEMENTING SIGNIFICANT LEVELS OF RENEWABLE RESOURCES INTO THE SYSTEM. AND AT THE SAME TIME INSURING A LOT RELIABLE ELECTRIC SERVICE TO CONSUMERS. WAIT WE'VE DONE THAT IS CAL I SO WORKS WITH OUR STAKEHOLDERS WITH A VERY OPEN AND TRANSPARENT STAKEHOLDER PROCESS. BUT WHAT WE'VE DONE IS WE'VE DEVELOPED AND DEPLOYED A NUMBER OF TECHNOLOGY TOOLS TO HELP US DO THIS. AND FIRST AND FOREMOST WHAT OUR PRIMARY GOAL IS BOUNCING LOADS AND RESOURCES AND MAKING SURE WE CONSERVE THAT THAT CONSUMER LOAD AT ALL HOURS. WE ALSO HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO THAT THE SAME TIME WE'RE INCREASING THAT RENEWABLES COMING FROM THE STATE'S OUR PS GOALS AND MORE POORLY NOW STARTING TO MEASURE AND QUANTIFY WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH GHG EMISSIONS. AS PART OF THOSE OPERATIONS. SO WE'RE CONTINUALLY WORKING TO REFINE THAT AND MOVE THIS FORWARD. BUT REALLY WHAT WE ARE SEEING IS AN ENHANCED CREATED THAT'S IMPROVING RELIABILITY FOR CALIFORNIA AND SOME OF THE WESTERN STATES AS WELL AND YOU'LL HEAR SOME MORE ABOUT THAT FROM US. IT'S IMPORTANT RECOGNIZE. THERE IS A MAJOR EVOLUTION HAPPENING IN THE WEST TODAY. PALM WE ARE NOT THE ONLY ISO THERE'S AT LEAST TWO OTHER AYE ESOS THAT ARE NOW LOOKING TO OPERATE IN THE WESTERN STATES. AND WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS MOST OF THE UTILITIES THROUGHOUT THE WESTERN STATES ARE ACTUALLY SEEKING OPPORTUNITIES TO INTEGRATE HIGHER LEVELS OF RENEWABLES. AND SEE HOW THEY CAN DO THAT ENSURING A RELIABLE GRID BUT ALSO DO THAT IN THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE WAY TO REDUCE THEIR COSTS AS WELL. SO THEY HAVE A SIMILAR SET OF GOALS THAT WE HAVE HERE. ON IN DOING THAT WE SEE THAT. IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO NOT LOSE. OPPORTUNITIES IN TERMS OF THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXPAND THE SIZE SO BECAUSE THE REALITY OF HIS THOSE UTILITIES ARE LOOKING. AND THE MORE ENTITIES THAT WE CAN BRING TOGETHER UNDER THIS ISO THE OPPORTUNITY AND THE LOWER COSTS AND THE BENEFITS THAT WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT. HAPPEN AS WE BRING MORE MORE ENTITIES TOGETHER. SO TO BE SURE WE'VE DEVELOPED YOU KNOW OUR RESPONSE TO THIS AS WELL AND SOME OF THE THINGS WE'VE DONE IS SOME VERY ADVANCED A TECHNOLOGY AS I MENTIONED BEFORE. PUT MORE POOR THE USING OUR IT PLATFORM TO HELP IN AB INTEGRATE AND ACTUALLY OPERATE FOR EXAMPLE HIGH LEVELS OF STORAGE AS THE STATE STARTS TO ADD MORE AND MORE STORAGE TO THE SYSTEM. IN ONE OF THE TOOLS TO EMIGRATE RENEWABLES. SO LET ME JUST SAY IN CLOSING. THE THE ISO SUPPORTS THE CHAIRMAN'S GOALS CERTAINLY IN TERMS OF EXPLORING AT THE GREAT THE OPPORTUNITIES AVAILABLE FROM REGIONAL COLLABORATION. AND WHAT WE WANT TO DO TODAY IS ARM SUPPOSED TO LET YOU KNOW THAT WE SUPPORT THE LEGISLATION THAT WOULD PROVIDE FOR A REGIONAL COLLABORATION. AND MORE POORLY WE STAND READY TO TRY TO BE A RESOURCE. AND HELP YOU MISTER CHAIR AS WELL AS THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS STAKEHOLDERS AND SO FORTH TO WORK THROUGH THIS DISCUSSION AND DEVELOPING SOME LEGISLATION THAT WOULD BE EFFECTIVE FOR CALIFORNIA. AND SO WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO HAND IT OVER TO. MY FRIEND MARK ROTH LEADER TO PROVIDE MORE DETAILS AND SHARE WITH YOU SOME OF THE EXPERIENCE WE'VE HAD AN OPERATING SYSTEM. THANK YOU. BUT YOU FILL CHAIR HOLDING THINK VERY MUCH FOR CONVENING THIS. DISCUSSION AND ASSEMBLYMEMBERS AND I LOOK FORWARD TO THE CONTINUING DISCUSSION ON THIS TOPIC. WHAT I'M GONNA GO THROUGH IS DESCRIBED BIT PROVIDE YOU A LITTLE BIT MORE INSIGHT INTO? WHAT A BALANCING AREA AUTHORITY DOES? UP THE CONTEXT OF WHERE CALIFORNIA IT EXIST RELATIVE TO THE REST OF THE WEST AND HOW THEIR INTERCONNECTED. I WILL DESCRIBE WHERE WE ARE IN TERMS OF. INTEGRATING RENEWABLES AND WHERE WHERE WE ARE LOOKING FORWARD IN TERMS OF INTEGRATING ADDITIONAL RENEWABLES. AND I'M GONNA DIVE INTO. A SIDE OF. DAYS THAT ILLUSTRATES SOME OF THE EXPERIENCE OPERATIONAL% EXPERIENCE THAT WE'VE ACTUALLY. OBSERVED AND AS I DO SO I'LL DESCRIBE. WHERE REGIONALIZATION MAY PLAY A ROLE IN HELPING US MANAGE OPERATIONALLY AT AN INEFFICIENT COST? THEN I'LL CLOSE WITH SOME. HIGHER LEVEL DISCUSSION ABOUT. REALLY REGULATIONS AS PART OF A SUITE OF SOLUTIONS THAT WE BELIEVE THAT ARE NECESSARY IF WE'RE GOING TO ACHIEVE. THE OBJECTIVE OF A LOWER CARBON GRID OUT OF IT AT A AT A REASONABLE COST. SO THAT. JUST THAT IT'S A TRADING WHERE WOULD WHERE IS CALIFORNIA IS SO IS CALIFORNIA IS SO IS A BALANCING AUTHORITY AREAS. MISTER PATTON HILL JUST DESCRIBED WE ARE INTERCONNECTED WE ARE THE LARGEST BALANCING AREA AND TERMS OF A LOAD IN THE WESTERN A CONNECTION. AND THAT DIAGRAM OF THE OUTLINE OF THE WESTERN UNITED STATES THAT OUTLINED ILLUSTRATES THAT THIS IS AN INTERCONNECTED SYSTEM. THE WIRES THE RESOURCES ARE ALL INTERCONNECTED SO RESOURCE THAT IS MOVING AT. CERTAIN SPEED AND IN CALIFORNIA IS MOVING THE SAME SPEAKERS INTERCONNECTED EFFECTIVELY CONNECTED TO OTHER RESOURCES THROUGHOUT THE WEST. IF YOU GO FURTHER EAST YOU ARE NOW INTO ANOTHER INTERCONNECTION SO THE WHOLE WEST IS ONE MACHINE IF YOU WANT TO CONSIDER THAT. WE ARE THE ONLY. CENTRALIZED. MARKET OPERATING REST THE ISL. ALBERTA IN CALLIN AND I CAN'T CANADA. THEY HAVE A MARKET UP THERE IN CANADA. THERE IS A MARKET FORMING IN THAT AREA THAT'S CALLED THE MOUNTAIN WEST TRANSMISSION GROUP AND AS MR PETTING GILL DESCRIBED. SOUTHWEST POWER POOL IS INTENDING TO PROVIDE BALANCING AREA SERVICES AND PROVIDE MARKET SERVICES. INTO THAT AREA. THE REST OF THE WEST OF THIS IS THAT THE YOU SEE IS GREEN IS BASICALLY OPERATING IN A BILATERAL ARRANGEMENTS. THEY CALL SOMEONE MAKE A DEAL WITH SOMEONE TO PRODUCE MORE ENERGY. TO BALANCE OUR SYSTEM. THAT SAID THERE ARE THIRTY EIGHT BALANCING AUTHORITY AREAS IN THE WEST. ALL OF THE HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF BASICALLY BALANCING ON A SECOND BY SECOND BASIS LOADS AND RESOURCES. SO ALL THESE THIRTY EIGHT BOUNCING AREAS ARE INDIVIDUALLY. COMING UP WITH THEIR RESOURCE PLAN THERE DISPATCH PLAN INTRADAY AND THEY ARE DOING THAT IN A SEMI COORDINATED WAY. BUT THEY'RE FOCUSED ON WHAT THEY NEED FOR THEIR SYSTEM. SO JUST TO ADD A LITTLE BIT MORE COLOR AROUND. BALANCING OKAY ONE OF THE FUNCTIONS OF THE BOUNCING AREA IS TO BASICALLY BALANCE LOW THE RESOURCES. THIS IS WHAT I'M GONNA DESCRIBE AND DISCUSS MORE THAN THE OTHER FUNCTIONS THERE ARE THERE ALL FUNCTIONS WE NEED TO MAINTAIN RELIABILITY ENSURING THAT NO. INDIVIDUAL TRANSMISSION ELEMENT IS OVERLOADED. BASICALLY SO IN SECURING SECURITY OF THE SYSTEM. IF THERE IS A MAJOR OUTAGE WE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR HELPING REBUILD THE SYSTEM BACK UP. OKAY. AND THEN WE ALSO HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF ENSURING THAT WE MAINTAIN ANOTHER RESERVES OPERATING RESERVES SO THAT WE ARE ALWAYS READY IN CASE WE LOSE A RESOURCE. WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO REPLACE THAT AND NOT HAVE ANY INTERRUPTION OF SERVICE OKAY. SO FOR THE REST MY DISCUSSION I'M GONNA BE FOCUSING MORE AROUND THE BALANCING PIECE. AND ON THE BALLOT IN PEACE. YOU THINK THIS IS A BALANCING ACT LOW THE RESOURCES IF THEY'RE IN BALANCE AND BECAUSE ELECTRICITY HAS TO BE CONSUMED AT THE SAME TIME IT'S PRODUCED EFFECTIVELY. WHEN IT IS IN BALANCE WE ARE HELPING MAINTAIN THE SPEED OF THE SYSTEM THE SPEED OF THE SYSTEM OF MEASURE BY. HURTS SIXTY HERTZ BLUE LIGHTS RIGHT NOW ARE BASICALLY IN WITH A FLICKERING AT SIXTY HERTZ YOU DON'T SEE IT BUT THEY ARE A TRIP IT'S OCCURRING. IF YOU'RE DEMAND IS GREATER THAN YOUR SUPPLY. IT'S THE WILL SLOW DOWN. OKAY THE VERY NARROW BAND WHICH WE OPERATE BASICALLY PLUS OR MINUS POINT ZERO SIX HERTZ IS THE BAND OF WHICH WE OPERATE. IF IT SLOWS DOWN TOO MUCH. WE BASICALLY GET TO THE POINT WHERE WE HAVE WITH IS AUTOMATIC RELAYS IT WILL BASICALLY INTERRUPT LOAD. PROTECT THE SYSTEM THAT HAPPENS AT FIFTY NINE POINT FIVE HURTS. NOW YOU CAN ALSO HAVE TOO MUCH SUPPLY AND THAT'S NOT GOOD EITHER BECAUSE IF IT TOO MUCH SUPPLY. YOU BASICALLY HAVE THE SYSTEM RUNNING FASTER THAN IT WOULD THAT IS DESIGNED FOR. AND. HAVING TOO MUCH SUPPLY CAN LEAD TO EQUIPMENT DAMAGE IF IT'S GOING TO FAST AND THAT COULD CREATE PERMANENT DAMAGE SO WE BASICALLY HAVE TO CONSTANTLY BALANCE. LOADS IN RESOURCES OUR PURCHASES OF ENERGY TO MAINTAIN THIS BALANCE AND MAINTAIN SIXTY HERTZ. YOU MAY HAVE READ RECENTLY THAT. IN THE. SERBIA. THEY WEREN'T ABLE TO MAINTAIN THIS FREQUENCY BALANCE A RESERVE ISSUES BETWEEN THE AREAS. AND IN FACT. THEY ACTUALLY CHANGE TIME OR SLOW DOWN TIME BY SIX MINUTES BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T IN AGREEMENT HOW TO MAINTAIN THIS BALANCE. THAT'S ONE. ILLUSTRATION OF WHAT HAPPENS YOU'RE NOT BALLOTS BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY WE'RE TRYING TO MAINTAIN THIS BALANCE SO THAT WE MAINTAIN RELIABILITY AND WERE PREPARED FOR. BOUNCING IF THERE'S ANY SYSTEM DISTURBANCE. WE MADE A TREMENDOUS PROGRESS IN INTEGRATING RENEWABLES. WE'VE GOT TWENTY ONE THOUSAND MEGAWATTS FIRST OFF. OUR P. CLOSE ABOUT FIFTY THOUSAND MEGAWATTS. WE HAVE TWENTY ONE THOUSAND MEGAWATTS OF LARGE SCALE RENEWABLES. INTER CONNECTED TO THE CALIFORNIA I AM SO GRID. IN ADDITION TO THAT. WE'VE GOT SIX THOUSAND MEGAWATTS OF ROOFTOP BEHIND THE METER SOLAR CONNECTED THE GRIT. THAT SIX THOUSAND MEGAWATTS A ROOFTOP SOLAR WE DON'T SEE THAT WE DON'T HAVE. VISIBILITY TO THAT DIRECTLY ALL WE SEE IS LESS LOAD ON THE SYSTEM. ON THE TWENTY ONE THOUSAND MEGAWATTS OF LARGE SCALE WE SEE THAT WE CAN SEE WAS PRODUCING WE CAN MANAGE IT AND. I INTO. WELL BOUNCE. AND WE WE MANAGED WE CAN SEE IT. THIS ALL GETS US. WE'RE BASICALLY NEAR OUR GOAL OF MEETING THIRTY THREE PERCENT OUR PS. AS WE MOVE ON AND WE MOVE ON TO FIFTY PERCENT ARE PS. WE NOW HAVE TO GET ADDITIONAL RENEWABLES BUILT ON THE SYSTEM. AND ROUGHLY SPEAKING YOU NEED TO ADD ANOTHER FIFTEEN THOUSAND MEGAWATTS OF. RENEWABLE CAPACITY IN THE SYSTEM. AT THIS POINT WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THAT MIX OF RESOURCES ARE GOING TO BE. BASED ON CC. PLANNING AND CPUC INTEGRATED RESOURCE PLANNING IT LOOKS LIKE ONE POSSIBILITY IS SOMETHING AROUND. ELEVEN THOUSAND. PLUS MEGAWATTS OF ADDITIONAL ADDITIONAL ROOFTOP SOLAR. AGAIN A LOT OF THAT MAY NOT BE VISIBLE TO THE OPERATOR. IN ADDITION TO THAT IS ABOUT THIRTY THREE HUNDRED MEGAWATTS POTENTIALLY OF ADDITIONAL RENEWABLES. ON THE GRID. AND THAT MAYBE LARGELY SOLAR RESOURCES. SO. WE DO THINK THAT FIFTY PERCENT IS ACHIEVABLE BY TWENTY THIRTY. IT CAN BE DONE. HOWEVER. THE WORK THAT WE DID TO GET TO THIRTY THREE PERCENT. THAT WORK HAS TO CONTINUE AND I PROBABLY HAVE TO ACCELERATE IN TERMS OF THE SOLUTION AND THE INNOVATION BECAUSE IT'S GONNA BE HARDER OPERATIONALLY. TO FIFTY PERCENT. BUT WILL LOOK FORWARD TO THE CHALLENGE. WHAT IN TO SHOW YOU NOW SOMETHING YOU'VE PROBABLY SEEN BEFORE? BUT I WANT ILLUSTRATE THIS E. OF THE DOCKER. STILL STRAIGHT WHERE WE ARE. WHERE WE THOUGHT WE WOULD BE BY THIS POINT? AND I'M GONNA ROLL INTO THE REST OF THE THE DIAGRAMS AND LEVERAGE THIS INFORMATION. SO WE PRODUCES FIRST OFF WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING AS IS THE DOCTOR THIS IS THE NET LOW THIS IS THE LOAD MINAS. VARIABLE RESOURCE OF THE WIND AND SOLAR PRODUCTION. THE REASON WHY WE TALK ABOUT. NET LOW IS BECAUSE OF THE BOUNCING AREA THAT'S EFFECTIVELY WHAT WE HAVE TO BALANCE WITH THE MOVE OTHER RESOURCES AROUND. TO BALANCE THAT NET LOAD. I DON'T HAVE CONTROL OVER THE VARIABLE RESOURCES FOR THE MOST PART. AND SO WE WERE REFER TO THE NET LOW IS WHAT WE'RE BALANCING FOR. AND YOU CAN SEE HERE WHEN WE PUT THIS TOGETHER ABOUT SIX YEARS AGO WE SAID OKAY WHAT WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN TO OUR NET LOAD. OVERTIME AND YOU CAN SEE HERE THAT WEEK WE EXPECTED AS. ADDITIONAL RENEWABLES SPECIFICALLY SOLAR IN THE MIDDLE OF DAY PRODUCE. WE WILL SEE THE NET LOW REDUCE FURTHER AND FURTHER IN THAT MIDDLE DAY CARE IT. WE EXPECTED TO BE WOULD BE ABOUT TWELVE THOUSAND MEGAWATTS BY TWENTY TWENTY. IN REALITY WE ARE CURRENTLY WE'VE SEEN A DAY DAYS ABOUT SEVEN THOUSAND MEGAWATTS. NET LOAD IN THE MIDDLE ON NICE SUNDAY SPRING CONDITION. AND I'LL EXPLAIN LATER WHY AND WHAT THAT MEANS TO US IN TERMS OF OPERATIONAL CONDITIONS BUT THE POINT IS AND YOU MAY ASK WHAT WHAT WHAT HAPPENED TO THE SIX THOUSAND MEGAWATTS WHY'D YOU MISS. YOUR YOUR YOUR EXPECTATIONS WHEN YOU MADE THIS PROJECTION SIX YEARS AGO. WHAT I THINK WE MISSED WAS THE LEVEL OF GROWTH AND? AMOUNT OF RENEWABLES ROOFTOP SOLAR. ó COMING ON TO THE SYSTEM. AND THAT WE'RE REDUCED EFFECTIVELY THE LOAD ITSELF AND. BRACELET TRADING THE. THE LOWER BELLY OF THE DOCK. THE SECOND THING THAT THIS. ILLUSTRATES FROM OPERATIONAL PERSPECTIVE IS. THE RAMP IN THE EVENING. AND AGAIN I'M BOUNCING THE SYSTEM OPERATE COSTLY BALANCING THE SYSTEM. AS THE LOAD CONTINUES TO GROW IN THE EVENING PEOPLE GO HOME LIGHTS COME ON. THE SOLAR IS ROLLING OFF SUN IS SETTING AND NOW WE HAVE. TO MANAGE BASICALLY. FOURTEEN THOUSAND WHAT WE'VE SEEN NOW FOURTEEN THOUSAND PLUS MEGAWATTS OVER A THREE HOUR PERIOD. BUT THAT IN CONTEXT. REMOVING THE EQUIVALENT OF. SIX DIABLO CANYONS OVER A THREE HOUR PERIOD THE BALANCE OF SYSTEM AT THIS POINT. OKAY. WE'VE GOTTEN GOOD AT DOING IT. WE KNOW HOW TO DO IT. THERE'S THEY'RE SUFFICIENT CAPACITY TO DO IT RIGHT NOW. I'M GONNA TAKE STILL STRAIGHT. NOW WHAT THE CHALLENGES. SOMETHING TO DIVE INTO A COUPLE THESE DAYS A LITTLE BIT DEEPER. AND I APOLOGIZE THAT THESE ARE BUSY SLIDES. BUT IT. STICK WITH ME HERE AS I LIKE TRYING TO DESCRIBE THIS. SO THIS IS FEBRUARY EIGHTEENTH THIS IS THE DAY THAT I JUST JUST DESCRIBE YOU THAT WE HAD A SEVEN THOUSAND MEGAWATTS. NET LOAD. MINIMUM AT LOW DAY. THAT NOW LOAD IS ILLUSTRATED BY THAT GRAD DOTTED LINE. OUR LOAD I DON'T LIKE IT. OUR LOAD IS THAT BLACK LINE. AT THE TOP. OKAY SO IF YOU LOOK FROM THE BOTTOM UP WHAT YOUR LEAK LOOKING AT IS THE RESOURCE MIX. THAT IS BEING PRODUCED TO BALANCE THE LOAD STARTING FROM THE BOTTOM. WE'VE GOT A THOUSAND MEGAWATTS OF DL CAN YOU CLEAR UP PLAN. ON THIS PARTICULAR DAY WE HAD MAINTENANCE ON ONE OF THE UNITS. SO AS A RESULT OF THAT WE CAN HAVE TO THOUSAND MEGAWATTS PRODUCTION WILL HELP THOUSAND MEGAWATTS PRODUCTION. AND THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THAT ACTUALLY MADE MORE ROOM FOR THE RENEWABLES. GOING UP. WE NOW LOOK AT GEOTHERMAL THERE'S ABOUT FIFTEEN HUNDRED MEGAWATTS GEOTHERMAL AND YOU CAN SEE IT'S LARGELY FLAT OVER THE DAY IT'S LARGELY A BASELOAD RESOURCE. THAT SAID THERE ARE GEOTHERMAL RESOURCES THAT ARE FLEXIBLE AND CAN BE DISPATCHED ON THIS PARTICULAR DAY THERE WERE THEY WERE NOT DISPATCHED. THE NEXT LEVEL UP IS EFFECTIVELY THE THERMAL OR GAS FLEET. AND YOU CAN SEE HERE THAT IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT DAY WHEN WE HAVE THE THE THE LOWEST THAT LOAD. WE STILL HAVE ABOUT FIFTEEN HUNDRED TO TWO THOUSAND MEGAWATTS OF GAS RESOURCE PRODUCING. I'M GONNAMOVE A LITTLE FASTER HERE NEXT UP IS HYDRO HYDRO WAS LARGER RUN OF THE RIVER. I WOULD HAVE TO TAKE THAT. NEXT UP IS IMPORTS THAT IMPORTS THIS IS THE INTERCHANGE FROM OUTSIDE THE AREA. NAY YOU MAY ASK WELL WHY ISN'T AT THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY WHEN WE HAVE THESE LOW NET LOADS AND FRANKLY OVERSUPPLY CONDITIONS WHY WE STILL IMPORTING FROM OUTSIDE. THE REASON IS THERE'S CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS. PALO VERDE IS A CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATION TO BE DELIVERED TO CALIFORNIA. THEIR* ALL ALL ARE ALSO IS PROBABLY SOME RENEWABLES THAT ARE IN THAT NET IMPORT. NEXT UP YOU'LL SEE WIND SO THAT'S THE GREEN THE DARKER GREEN. AND THAT'S PRODUCING ABOUT THREE THOUSAND TO FOUR THOUSAND MEGAWATTS AT THAT TIME. NEXT UP YOU SEE THE WITNESS THE SOLAR. AND THAT SOLAR THE ABOUT EIGHT NINE THOUSAND MEGAWATTS. IN THE NEXT UP YOU SEE THE RED SECTION JUST ABOVE THE BLACK LINE THAT BLACK LINE AGAIN WAS THE LOAD. THE READ INDICATES THAT WE CANNOT TAKE ALL THE SOLAR. THAT'S THE AMOUNT A SOLAR THAT WE COULD NOT TAKE AND WE EFFECTIVELY CURTAILED. FORTUNATELY WE HAD ECONOMIC BIDS TO CURTAIL SO WE COULD MANAGE IT. AND IT WAS GOOD BUT EIGHT THERE IS ABOUT EIGHTEEN HUNDRED MEGAWATTS DURING THAT DAY THAT WE COULD NOT USE ALL THE RENEWABLES. AND WE HAD A BASICALLY STOP THE PRODUCTION. NOW MOVING NOW FROM A REGIONAL PERSPECTIVE. WHAT THE REGIONAL OPPORTUNITY IN ONE PART HELPS US DO IS THAT THAT? LIGHT GREEN IMPORT. IF WE HAVE A BETTER WAY OF COORDINATING ACROSS THE WEST WE MAY BE ACTUALLY TURN THAT AROUND BECAUSE WE COULD ACTUALLY DE COMMIT RESOURCES EXTERNALLY. BASED ON OUR ARE A HOW WE SEE THAT THE EXPECTATION OF THE WHOLE SYSTEM AND THEN OPTIMIZE OF ALL SYSTEM. WE COULD TURN THAT AROUND SO IT'S THAT WE CAN MAKE MORE ROOM FOR THE RENEWABLES IN STATE. NOW I'M GONNA MOVE ONTO THEIR TO I'M SURE I'M GONNA MOVE ON TO GROW QUICKLY THE EVENING WRAPPED IN THIS PARTICULAR DAY WAS ONLY THIRTEEN THOUSAND MEGAWATTS RAMP. AND THAT'S THAT'S FROM OUR ENDING SIXTEEN TO THAT OUR IN THE NINETEEN THAT'S THAT SHADED AREA. THE QUESTION I'M TRYING TO RUB SHOW HERE OF WHAT A METRON RESPONSES WHAT'S MEETING THAT NET RAMP. IT'S NOT SOLAR SOLAR TRAMPING OUT SOLAR SHUTTING DOWN AT THIS TIME. WHAT'S MEETING THAT RAMP AND THE EVENING PEAK. IS IMPORTED ENERGY. GAS RESOURCES IN CALIFORNIA. AND HYDRO AND THOSE PERCENTAGES DESCRIBE WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THAT EVENING RAMP IS BEING MET BY THOSE PARTICULAR RESOURCES. NOW WE HAVE A LONGER TERM OBJECTIVE TO REDUCE RELIANCE ON GAS. THEN THE QUESTION IS HOW SO WE'RE TO MEET THAT EVENING RAN. EITHER GONNA HAVE TO RELY MORE ON IMPORTS. ORGAN AFTER RELYING ON OTHER SOLUTIONS STORAGE. AND OTHER SOLUTIONS TO FILL THAT EVENING. THE SOLAR IS NOT PRODUCING AT THAT POINT. SINCE YOU NOW ARE NOW FAMILIAR WITH THIS GRAPH I'M GONNA PROBABLY JUST THAT GO THROUGH THIS ONE A LITTLE BIT QUICKER THIS IS THE DAY. THAT WE HAVE THE LARGEST THREE OUR RAMP IN THE EVENING. AND I JUST WANT US POINT OUT THAT FOURTEEN THOUSAND MEGAWATT EVENING AROUND ON THIS DAY. WAS MET BY. NOT SIXTY PERCENT IMPORTS BUT THIRTY NINE PERCENT APART GAS ACTUALLY MET FIFTY PERCENT ALMOST OF THAT LOAD ON THIS PARTICULAR DAY. AND HYDRO PROVIDED ABOUT TEN PERCENT. BUT I'M TRYING TO SHOW HERE THAT FROM DAY TO DAY YOU CAN'T MISS I RELY ON THE SAME AMOUNT. FROM EXTERNAL. SOURCES. THERE MAY BE IMPLICATED THERE MAY BE CONSTRAINTS OUTSIDE THEIR LIMITING THAT ABILITY OF THAT OF THOSE RESOURCES TO COME INTO CALIFORNIA. AND THAT'S WHY WE HAVE TO BE READY TO BE ABLE TO. HAVE A PROPER MIX TO BOUNCE SYSTEM. OKAY. IS MY LAST. A GRAPHICAL SLIDE. I AM NOW SWITCHING SEASONS. NOW I'M IN THE SUMMER. THIS IS THE DAY THAT WE HAD THE HIGHEST LOAD. OF LAST YEAR. OUR LOAD PEAK AT ABOUT FIFTY THOUSAND MEGAWATTS. WE HAVE NOT BEEN A FIFTY THOUSAND MEGAWATTS SINCE TWO THOUSAND SIX. OKAY. TWO THOUSAND SIX. JUST GIVE YOU A REFERENCE THAT WAS A ONE IN ABOUT ONE HUNDRED TEMPERATURE DAY. THIS WAS THE ONE IN NINETEEN YEAR TEMPERATURE DAY. THE CONSIDER BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND SIX AND NOW TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN I JUST. EXPLAIN TO WE HAVE ABOUT SIX THOUSAND MEGAWATTS OF ADDITIONAL SOLAR BEHIND THE METER. IF WE WERE SUCCESSFUL IN INTEGRATING ALL THAT BEHIND THE METER SOLAR THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN A FIFTY SIX THOUSAND MEGAWATT DAY. OKAY SO. THE FACT THAT WE ARE INTEGRATED RENEWABLES IS HELPING MANAGE OUR LOW. HOWEVER. AS THE SUN GOES DOWN. FIRST UP. SO WE. WE ARE EXPECTING IN WE WE FORECASTED WITH ABOUT FORTY EIGHT THOUSAND MEGAWATTS LOAD FORTY SIX THOUSAND MEGAWATTS LOAD FOR THIS PARTICULAR YEAR PEAK. WE EXCEEDED THAT. OKAY THAT HAPPENS TEMPERATURE CONDITIONS CHANGE. WHEN THE SUN GOES DOWN OUR LOAD WHICH IS REPRESENTED BY THAT WHERE THAT DOTTED RED LINE AND THE BLACK LINE ME. STILL. HIGHER THAN OUR FORECAST OF NET LOW OR FORECASTED LOAD FOR THE ENTIRE YEAR WAS EXPECTED TO BE. AND WE HAVE NO SOLAR PRODUCTION AT THAT. SO WHAT THAT MEANS AND IT'S ILLUSTRATED HERE'S TO MEET THAT TWO HOUR LATER. LOW LEVEL THAT STILL VERY HIGH WHAT DID WE RELY ON. WE RELIED ON A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF GAS RESOURCES AS REPRESENTED BY THE BROWN. HYDRO WHICH WAS A GOOD HYDRO YOUR LAST YEAR SO WE'RE VERY FORTUNATE. AND THEN THE GREEN WHICH IS ON THAT IN COURT OF ABOUT I THINK ABOUT EIGHT TO NINE THOUSAND MEGAWATTS OF NET IMPORT. THIS IS HOW WE MEET OUR LOW. FROM AN OPERATOR'S PERSPECTIVE. THEIR STRESS LEVEL WAS NOT AT THE TIME WHEN WE PEAKED. THEIR STRESS LEVEL WAS HIGHEST BETWEEN THAT TIME. AND WHEN WE HIT THAT TWO HOUR THREE HOUR LOOK LATER PEAK. THAT'S BECAUSE. LOOK NET LOW TO STILL GROWING ON THEM. THEY'RE LOSING EIGHT THOUSAND MEGAWATTS OF SOLAR. AND THEY STILL HAVE TO BALANCE THE SYSTEM. AGAIN I WANNA POINT OUT. WE HAVE ENOUGH RESOURCES TO DO THIS. WE ARE ABLE TO MANAGE IT. PLAYING THIS FORWARD NOW. WE'LL HAVE SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT MORE RENEWABLE RESOURCES. THE GAS FLEET MAY NOT BE THE SAME GAS FLEET THAT WE HAVE TODAY. SO WE HAVE TO START LOOKING FOR INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS. TO HELP BOUNCE THE SYSTEM OTHERWISE THERE COULD BE INSUFFICIENT RAMPING OR INSUFFICIENT CAPACITY TO MEET THE LOW. AND THAT WILL NOT BE GOOD THAT WOULD BE A RELIABILITY ISSUE. SO IN SUMMARY. WHAT I'M SHOWING YOU HERE IS THAT I'M NOT JUST FOCUSED WE'RE NOT JUST FOCUSED ON REGIONALIZATION THERE IS A SUITE OF SOLUTIONS THAT'S GOING TO BE NECESSARY? THIS IS A BIG ENOUGH SCALE ISSUE THAT WE NEED A VARIETY OF SOLUTIONS WHETHER IT BE FOR STORAGE LARGE SCALE TO BATTERY STORAGE. DEMAND RESPONSE. ELECTRIC VEHICLES ACTUALLY PARTICIPATING IN BACK HELPING BALANCE THE SYSTEM. THE RENEWABLE THEMSELVES HAVING THEM DISPATCH A BOWL AND PROVIDING RELIABILITY SERVICES THAT HAVE TRADITIONALLY BEEN PROVIDED BY THE GAS FLEET. GETTING THOSE RESOURCE TO PROVIDE RELIABILITY. WE'VE BEEN PER WE'VE PROVEN THAT THAT CAN HAPPEN TECHNOLOGICALLY. AND THEN LASTLY WE'VE STARTED TO SEE HOW REGIONALIZATION. THROUGH AT LEAST INITIALLY THE ENERGY IMBALANCE MARKET HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN HELPING US MANAGE THESE RENEWABLES. ON THAT DAY WHEN WE HAD OVER SUPPLY WE ARE ACTUALLY USING THE ENERGY IMBALANCE MARKET AND WE WERE SENDING THREE THOUSAND MEGAWATTS OUT TO OTHER PARTS OF THE SYSTEM. AND THEN BRING IT BACK AGAIN THREE HOURS LATER WHEN WE HAD TO TAKE THAT RAMP. IT'S AN EFFECTIVE USE OF THE REGIONAL RESOURCES. WHAT THE REGIONALIZATION THE BROADER REGIONALIZATION DOESN'T MOVE THAT FROM REAL TIME TO NOW DAY AHEAD AND ALSO POTENTIALLY PLANNING FOR LONGER TERM CAPACITY? GETTING THE RIGHT MIX OF RESOURCES IN THE SYSTEM. AND THEN LASTLY. BUT I'LL CLOSE WITH THAT I THINK THAT'S WERE LIKE THOSE AND I'M. HOPEFULLY WE CAN CONTINUE THIS DISCUSSION ABOUT HOW REGIONALIZATION. IS AN EFFECTIVE NOT THE ONLY SOLUTION BUT AN EFFECTIVE SOLUTION HELPING US OPERATE THE GRID IN AND DO IT A COST EFFECTIVE WAY. BUT WE APPRECIATE THE. PRESENTATION THEN VERY THE CLARITY ON THAT I'M GONNA TURN TO MEMBERS IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OF THIS PANEL BEFORE WE MOVE ON TO OUR. NEXT. THERE ARE NONE PROFESSOR. SQUARE HARM. SO I THOUGHT THANK YOU BOTH FOR YOUR UP PRESENTATIONS. CLEARLY ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE COULD BENEFIT FROM BY THE WAY I NOTICED ON THAT PEAK DAY IF YOU WANT TO GO BACK TO THAT FOR. THERE WAS NO WIND. YEAH GOOD POINT. THERE OTHER THERE IS NO DARK GREEN WELL THERE IS. I CITY THERE'S A SMALL AMOUNT YEAH HARDLY BEEN THAT'S NOT THAT'S NOT UNUSUAL ON THE HOTTEST DAYS AND THE WIND IN CALIFORNIA. BECAUSE WELL UPS. SO. CLEARLY IF WE'RE GOING WE DON'T HAVE ANYONE TO OUR WEST SO WE'RE NOT GOING TO GET SOLAR TO HELP US WITH THE EVENING PEAK. WE DO HAVE PEOPLE TO THE EAST. OUR PARTICULAR IN THE SPRING THERE'S AM MORNING RAM. THAT COULD CLEARLY HELP WITH SOLAR. THERE'S ALSO. WIND AND. WYOMING THAT GOES ALL THE TIME THAT WE NEED MORE TRANSMISSION FOR THAT HOW DO YOU VISUALIZE THE IMPORT OF RENEWABLES FROM OTHER AREAS I'VE MENTIONED A COUPLE OF POSSIBILITIES PERHAPS YOU COULD EXPAND ON THAT. WE MAKE A GOOD POINT THAT FROM A SOLAR PERSPECTIVE. THAT THE SOLAR TO THE EAST WILL BE. BASICALLY ON. TURN DOWN BEFORE OUR OUR SOLAR. I THINK FROM A PERSPECTIVE OF WHEN WE STILL HAVE SOLAR WE MY BILL WILL BE MEETING BECAUSE WE HAVE AN ADDITIONAL SUPPLY THAN WE NEED WE COULD BE SERVING SOME OF THEIR. LOAD WITH OURS RATHER THAN CURTAILING THE RENEWABLES. WE ARE HELP THEM MEET THEIR EVENING PEAK YES. FROM A NGUYEN PERSPECTIVE THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF WIND AND A. NGUYEN THAT DOESN'T. DIE OFF IN THE HOTTEST DAYS OF ACTION BLOWS AND AND IN THE MIDDLE DE ON THE HOTTEST DAYS. IN WYOMING INTO MEXICO. I'M DESCRIBING WHAT THE POSSIBILITIES ARE AND I WANNA BE CLEAR. LIFE IS SO DOESN'T DETERMINE WHAT RESOURCES WE SHOULD DEVELOP AND PROCURE GOING FORWARD THAT'S A STATE POLICY DECISION. WE ONLY DISPATCH WHAT IS THE RESOURCES THAT ARE PROVIDED TO US AND WE BOUNCE A SYSTEM. SO THE DECISION ABOUT REGIONALIZATION DOESN'T DETERMINE. BUT IT DOES PROVIDE AN OPTION AUDI THAT YOU CAN TO NOW LOOK AT A BROADER SET OF RESOURCE OF THE WEST BUT IT DOESN'T REQUIRE YOU AS A STATE. TO GO GET THOSE RESOURCES YOU CAN MAKE THOSE DECISIONS OF THE STATE. SO. WHAT? RIGHT NOW WE HAVE THE ENERGY IMBALANCE MARKET WHICH IS BASICALLY. BOB YOU'RE MEETING THANKS WHAT IS SAID IN A FIVE MINUTE. YES SO WE DISPATCHED ON A FIVE AND FIFTEEN MINUTE BASIS. ACROSS NOW ROUGHLY HALF THE WEST. YOU KNOW I'M ONE OF THE SUGGESTIONS WE'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM A LATER PANEL THAT I BRING THIS UP IS A QUESTION TO YOU NOW. IS COULD WE. EXPAND BE ENERGY IMBALANCE MARKET WHICH IS NOW FOR FIVE AND FIFTEEN MINUTES TO A LONGER TIME. TO GET STARTED ON SOME OF THESE ISSUES ARE BEFORE THE POLITICAL ISSUES ARE NECESSARILY. SETTLED IS THAT FEASIBLE OR NOT. IT'S POTENTIALLY FOR. HIS POTENTIALLY FEASIBLE. YEAH. THAT IT WOULD ENERGY IMBALANCE MARKET SAY FOR DAY AHEAD. SO WE ARE INVESTIGATING ACT. OKAY. THE THE POINT ONE MAKE ON THAT THAT ANSWER THOUGH IS THAT. WHILE IT MAYBE ILL GET YOU A PORTION OF THE BENEFITS THAT THAT. REGIONALIZATION WOULD DO WHAT WOULD COULD COVER. IT WAS TOUGH TO BE VOLUNTARY. AND SO. THE BOUNCING AREAS WOULD HAVE TO VOLUNTARILY DECIDE THAT THEY WANT TO PARTICIPATE. IT MAY NOT PER PROVIDE AS MUCH TRANSMISSION AND EFFECTIVENESS. AS. A REGIONAL MARKET WOULD I SAY AND. DO INVEST IN TRANSMISSION YOU'RE GONNA NEED THAT LEVEL OF CERTAINTY. WELL I THINK THIS NOT EVEN ABOUT INVESTMENT NEW TRANSMISSION. HOW THE EXISTING TRANSMISSION? AND HOW MUCH OF THE EXISTING TRANSMISSION WOULD BE MADE AVAILABLE WOULD BE IN QUESTION HOW MUCH OF THAT WOULD REALLY COME TO THE BROADER ENERGY BALANCE MARKET IF WE EXPANDED TO THE HEAD. AND THE REASON THAT IS THAT THEY HAVE BILATERAL ARRANGEMENTS FOR TRANSMISSION THEY SOLD THAT TRANSMISSION OFF IN. HOW THAT TRANSIT BECOMES AVAILABLE DINGY BELTS MARKER THE DAY AHEAD? MAYBE IN QUESTION. I SEE THANK YOU. PATTERSON AND THEN DOCTOR EGGMAN. A THANK YOU PRESENT EUROPE. AND YOUR PRESENTATION I WANT ONE EXPLORA. THE MARGINS FOR ERROR ON ON OPERATIONS AND GIVEN THE COUPLE DIFFERENT SCENARIOS ARE. SO ESSENTIALLY WE'RE USING. A VARIATION OF A SPOT MARKET RIGHT NOW. WHICH GIVES YOU A VERY SHORT WINDOW TO GET IT RIGHT. THAT THIS RIGHT IF YOU DON'T GET IT RIGHT A SHORT WINDOW. WE CAN HAVE SOME UPPER OPERABILITY EN. OTHER SERIOUS PROBLEMS YET SO JUST DANCE ACQUITTAL BUT WE START PLANNING THIS ONE DATE ADVANCE YES YOU HAVE THAT WHERE THAT. ONE TRY TO GET TO IS. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN AND A. AND IMMIGRANT INTEGRATE WESTERN INTEGRATED SYSTEM AND THE SPOT MARKET WITH RESPECT TO HOW FAR. YOU YOU COULD GET IN THE PLANNING PROCESS I'VE TAKEN A COUPLE OF TOURS WHAT I REALLY LIKE IS HOW YOU'RE ABLE. IN A. PREVIOUS TWENTY FOUR HOURS WITH A BUNCH OF AND PUTS IN A LOT OF. MODELING YOU GET A PRETTY STRAIGHT. THE NEXT DAY WITH THE ANTICIPATIONS OF THE ISSUES. BUT YOU STILL HAVE TO DEAL WITH US SPOT MARKET TO FIX IT. IF YOU HAD INTEGRATION AND WE WERE COOPERATIVE. WITH THOUGH WESTERN. WOULD WE BE ABLE TO HAVE. RELIABLE TWENTY FOUR HOUR PLANNING THAT WOULD MAKE YOUR MARGINS OF ERROR. A LATIN LAST SERB. AT CREATION OF INDIGESTION YEAH SO THE SHORT ANSWER IS YES AND I THINK TO SOMEWHERE IMMENSE QUIRKS ó PREVIOUS QUESTION. FIRST OFF REGULATION WOULD GET YOU A. MORE COORDINATED DAY AHEAD MARKET. FOR AND WITH ALL THE TRANSMISSION THAT WAS PARTICIPATING. BUT ALSO GET YOU NOW A. COORDINATED RESOURCE PLAN. LOOKING OUT A YEAR IN ADVANCE A MONTH IN ADVANCE. AND YOU CAN MAKE YOUR LONG TERM PLANNING DECISIONS IN A COORDINATOR Y. ABOUT WHAT TRANSMISSION WHAT RESOURCES. YOU WANT TO DEVELOP. KNOWING THAT THE STATE DECISIONS OUR WHAT RESOURCE ONE DEVELOP THE CAN DO THAT NOW IN A COORDINATED WAY. WITH A TRANSMISSION PLANNING PROCESS WHERE YOU NEED TO SUPPORT. OR WHERE TRANSMISSION NEEDS TO BE DEVELOPED TO SUPPORT THAT PLAN. U. DO NOT GET THAT YOU NOW WITH JUST A. EXPANDING THE ENERGY IMBALANCE MARKET INTO THE DAY AHEAD THOSE OF THE LONGER TERM PLANNING BENEFITS. SEVEN MAYBE I CAN ADD TO THIS WHAT MARK SAYING HERE'S WELL ELECT. MOVE YOUR MICROPHONE A LITTLE CLOSER YES SIR SORRY BOMB GOES GOES TO THE FACT WHAT WOULD WE DO IN THAT DAY AHEAD TIME FRAME. AND EFFECTIVELY WHAT WE'RE DOING TODAY IS WE ARE RUNNING THE DAY AHEAD MARKET AND IDENTIFYING ALL OF THE RESOURCES WE NEED. TO RELIABLY SERVE LOW THE NEXT DAY BUT AS YOU POINT OUT ONE OF THINGS THAT HAPPENS IS DOING DAY AHEAD IN REAL TIME IS WE KNOW THINGS ARE GONNA CHANGE THE FORECAST COULD BE OFF WE GET OF A FORCED OUTAGE AND SO FORTH. I THINK TO ADD ON TO WHAT MARK IS SAYING IS WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT HAVING A MUCH LARGER FOOTPRINT. SUDDENLY WE HAVE ACCESS TO MANY MORE RESOURCES A MUCH MORE DIVERSE MIX OF RESOURCES TO HELP SET UP THAT DISPATCHED FOR THE FOLLOWING DAY. AND HIS MARKS POINTING OUT OF BACK TO SOME WOMEN QUIRK QUESTION A MUCH LARGER TRANSMISSION INFRASTRUCTURE. IN ORDER TO ACCESS THOSE RESOURCES SO IN THE END TO YOUR POINT WE END UP WITH A MORE RELIABLE DISPATCH COMING OUT OF THE DAY AHEAD JUST BECAUSE WE HAVE A LARGER FLEET TO WORK WITH. AND YOU ALSO GET A MORE EFFICIENT DISPATCH AND PLAN BECAUSE YOU CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE FACT THAT. LET'S SAY THE NORTHWEST THEY PEAK IN THE WINTER WE PEAK IN THE SUMMER. SO THE FACT THAT THEY DON'T PICK AT THE SAME TIME YOU CAN NOW GET A BETTER SHARING OF THE DAYS DIVERSE RESOURCES BECAUSE THAT DIVERSITY OF. HOW THE LOAD? ATTRACT BUYERS ONE OTHER QUESTION ABOUT. THAT THE OVER PROCUREMENT UPS OF SOME RENEWABLES I THINK IT'S BASICALLY SO IF I'M. UNDERSTAND OUR UNDERSTANDING IT CORRECTLY YOU GOTTA. PERIOD OF TIME UP THERE WHAT YOU GOT TO COULD CURTAIL. IN THAT CURTAILMENT PROCESS HAVE WE BOUGHT THAT ELECTRICITY ALREADY. EFFECTIVE THE U. YOU'VE PAID FOR THAT CAPACITY YOU PAY FOR ELECTRICITY THROUGH POWER PURCHASE AGREEMENTS REDWOOD SO SO WE. WE WE PAY FOR THAT YES. IS IT IS I MEAN IS IT POSSIBLE IN IN IN IN A WESTERN INTEGRATED CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE. A I GUESS INSTEAD OF CURTAILING AYE AYE AND WHAT WE DO WITH IT IF I GET IT TO GET RID OF IT. CANNOT BE SENT TO THE REST OF THE YES REGION AND COULD IT BE. THAT POSSIBLY PRICED AT A WAY THAT IF WE DIDN'T GET. ALL OF THEM. MONEY BACK THAT WE SPENT A BIKE THAT WE WOULD GET SOMETHING BACK YES. YOU ARE WHAT YOU WOULD DO IS YOU MAY BE YOU MAY BE SELLING IT OFF AT A LOWER COST BUT. YOU GET TO BENEFITS ONE IS YOU MAY BE DISPLACING OTHER RESOURCES HIGHER COSTS RESOURCES THROUGHOUT THE WEST. YOU MAY BE ABLE STORE THAT ENERGY. IN THE HYDRO SYSTEM IN THE NORTHWEST. AT WHICH POINT THAT ENERGY WILL COME BACK TO YOU WHEN YOU NEED IT FOR THE. ANOTHER PERIOD OF TIME SO YOU FACTUALLY CAN USE THE REST WESTERN GRID AND THE RESOURCE IN THE WESTERN BRED TO STORE THAT ENERGY. THE SYSTEM IS A STORAGE DEVICE ITSELF I'VE HEARD FROM SOME OF THEM. MANUFACTURERS IN CALIFORNIA PEOPLE WHO ARE SPENDING QUITE A BIT OF MONEY ON THEIR ELECTRICITY. THEY'RE BASICALLY ASKING MAY WELL IF WE HAVE ALREADY PRE PURCHASED A SIMILAR TRICITY THAT WE CAN'T USE. OF WHY CAN'T OUR CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURERS IN OUR CALIFORNIA. RATE PAYERS TAP INTO THIS DISCOUNTED. EXTRA AVAILABLE. ELECTRICITY I WOULD THINK THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING VERY INTERESTING SO I DON'T WANNA. I DON'T THINK I WANT TO NECESSARILY GIVEAWAY THAT OPTION. AND AND AND. BUT I'D ACTUALLY LIKE TO ENCOURAGE THAT OPTIONS SO THAT. YOU KNOW FOLKS WELL ACTUALLY PLAN ON ELECTRICITY. WRITING THAT'S THAT'S MUCH MORE STABLE AND AND AND AND LESS SO WHAT YOU JUST DESCRIBED IS ONE OF THE BENEFITS OF HAVING A MARKET WITH MARKET PRICES. BECAUSE IN THAT MIDDLE THE DAY. WE ARE SETTING PRICES POTENTIALLY LOW ZERO DOLLARS OR MAYBE EVEN EIGHT DOLLARS. IF YOU WERE ABLE TO TAKE THOSE PRICES PLANS HAVE IT TRANSLATED WE'RE PAYING PEOPLE TO TAKE IT YES. IF YOU WERE TO PASS OUT THROUGH THROUGH A RETAIL RATE STRUCTURE THAT RECOGNIZE THAT. THROUGH THE TIME OF USES OR DYNAMIC PRICING. YOU COULD ACTUALLY INCENTIVIZE. LOADS TO INCREASE AND USE THAT ENERGY. THAT'S REALLY POWERFUL AS YOU WANT TO LEVERAGE THE ELECTRIC GRID TO DE CARBONIZED OTHER PARTS OTHER SECTORS WHAT CAN YOU DO THAT. CHARGED BATTERIES FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLES AT THAT TIME. THIS IS WHERE THE POWER OF THE. D. CARBONIZED ELECTRIC GRID THEN TRANSPIRES INTO THE CAR NOTHING OTHER PARTS OF THE SECTORS I DOUBT I ACTUALLY THINK THAT. REGIONALIZATION IS GOING TO BE A CALIFORNIA WANTS TO BE A LEGACY LEADER IN ALL OF THIS AND I ACTUALLY THINK IF WE REGIONAL EYES THERE'S. AND I I WANNA HEAR THE OPPOSITION AND OTHERS WHO HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THIS BUT IT WOULD SEEM TO ME. THAT THE THAT IF WE HAD THIS. REGIONAL A REVITALIZED A FULLY INTEGRATED MARKET. THAT MARKET FORCES BECAUSE CALIFORNIA. IS SUCH A BROAD LARGE. USER THAT OUR PREFERENCES MIGHT VERY WELL. ENGAGE AN INCENTIVE FIVE THE OTHER UP PARTICIPANTS. TWO UP. PROCURING CERTAIN WAYS BECAUSE THE MARKET IN CALIFORNIA WOULD BE VERY MUCH INTERESTED IN IT AS WELL. IS THAT. A WAY WE CAN SHIP OUR. ENERGY LEGACY EAST. YO YOU WHAT YOU GET IS THEN THE BENEFIT OF. SHARE OUR RESOURCES AND SHARE OUR CLEAN RESOURCES YOU CAN ACTUALLY HELP DE CARBONIZED OTHER SECTORS OF THE WEST. AND JUST TO ILLUSTRATE THAT POINT. THREE TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN AND AND. TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN. WE REDUCE CARBON REDUCTION FROM THE AYE ESOS DISPATCH BY TWENTY THREE PERCENT. NOW I'M NOT SAYING THAT THAT'S BECAUSE OF ENERGY IMBALANCE MARKET SOLELY I MEAN IT'S OBVIOUSLY BECAUSE. WE WERE INTEGRATING MORE RENEWABLES AND. FOR A LOOK AT PACIFIC CORE. PARTICIPATING IN JIM BOUNCE MARKET. FROM THE TIME THAT THEY STARTED THE ENERGY AMOUNTS MARKET. THERE WERE. GHG REDUCTION WENT EL WAS ABOUT FOURTEEN PERCENT OVER THE SAME PERIOD TIME. I THINK THAT ILLUSTRATES HOW. HAVING A COORDINATED MARKET WOULD ALLOW US TO HELP DE CARBONIZED AND MAKE BETTER USE OF ALL THE RESOURCES IN THE WEST. AND HELP DE CARBONIZED THE WEST. SEEM TO ME THAT WOULD ALSO BE PRESSURES ON ON PRICES IS WELL TOMORROW BLOOM LANDING WE'RE GONNA GET IT FOR LESS PRICES AND YET THEY'RE NOT GETTING A BIT NAM THEY'RE NOT GETTING IT JUST BECAUSE IT'S CLEAN RESOURCES GETTING BECAUSE ECONOMIC ENERGY. AND. I WE CAN BE. A CALL RESOURCE WITH OUR CLEAN ENERGY BECAUSE MARGINAL COST ZERO. THEY HAVE A HIGHER MARGINAL COST WE HAVE A FEW COST WE CAN BEAT THAT CAN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE PRESENTATIONS CHAIRMAN THANK YOU. DOCTOR EGGMAN. YEAH ALSO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT FOR THE. REPRESENTATION. AND I I MEAN DISTRESSING TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION AND I'VE BEEN A CONSCIOUS WITHOUT LEGISLATOR FROM. SOME OF THESE MARTA EASTERN STATES AND. THEY TALK A LOT ABOUT CARTMAN. VERY LITTLE ABOUT THAT OTHER THING SO IT'S GONNA BE INTERESTING AS WE GO FORWARD. ARM. IN AND BECAUSE THEY'RE VERY PROTECTIVE OF THEIR THEIR JOBS AND JOB MARKET AND AND TRADITIONAL ECONOMY IF YOU WILL. UP SO AS WE CONTINUE TO MOVE TO WITH OUR. NO CREATE CREATE MARKETS AND VALUES THAT REFLECT OUR GOALS AND OUR VALUES. WE EXPAND THAT PIE TO MORE REGIONAL WAY. I'M JUST WONDERING YOUR YOUR IMPRESSION OF THE IMPACT THEN ON OUR ON OUR OUR JOB ECONOMY. IN CALIFORNIA AS WE CONTINUE TO EXPAND OTHER STATES RIGHT WOULD MAKE THINGS MORE AFFORDABLE. WHAT THEN DOES THAT DO? FOR OUR LOCAL. JOB ECONOMY AS IT RELATES TO. ALTERNATE ENERGY YEAH I'LL TAKE THIS ONE. IS A EXCELLENT QUESTION AND ONE THAT WAS TEED UP IN S. B. THREE FIFTY AND SO IN THE ANALYSIS THAT WE DID. WHAT WE FOUND IS PART OF WHAT'S COMING OUT OF THIS OVERALL ECONOMIC BENEFIT OF HAVING A REGIONAL MARKET? IS LOWER ENERGY PRICES FOR CALIFORNIA CONSUMER. AND WOULD THAT THEN DOES IS CREATES AN ECONOMIC ENGINE TO CREATE ADDITIONAL JOBS. ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS WE FOUND ANOTHER SECTORS INTO IT WELL IT'S SPREAD ACROSS DIFFERENT SECTORS AND FAIR ENOUGH IT DOES AFFECT DIFFERENT SECTORS IN DIFFERENT WAYS. RIGHT WITH THE OVERALL NET BENEFIT OF HAVING THE REGIONAL IS AN INCREASE IN JOBS FOR CALIFORNIA IN ITS FAIR ENOUGH TO SAY THAT AFFECTS DIFFERENT SECTORS. ONE OTHER INTERESTING THINGS ABOUT IT IS HAVING THAT LOWER COST FOR ENERGY ACTUALLY HAD THE INCREASE BENEFIT TO DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. BECAUSE THEIR ENERGY BILLS SUCH A LARGE PORTION OF THEIR TOTAL INCOME REDUCING THAT COST TO THEM HAD A MUCH BIGGER BENEFIT TO THEM IT WAS AT LEAST A TEN PERCENT BIGGER VALUE. IN TERMS OF WHAT IT DID FOR THEM AND CREATING MORE VALUE AND WORTH TO THEM. SO I THINK WHAT WE DID IN THAT ANNOUNCES DEFYING THAT YES THERE IS AFFECT ON JOBS IN DIFFERENT SECTORS BUT OVERALL THERE'S A NET INCREASE IN JOBS ACROSS THE ACROSS THE STATE. THEY WATCH. BECAUSE RISK. THANK YOU SO MUCH. AT THE END OF YOUR PRESENTATION INITIALLY YOU INDICATED THAT. REGIONALIZATION IS AN EFFECTIVE SOLUTION. IT'S NOT THE ONLY SOLUTION. WHAT OTHER SOLUTIONS ARE THERE? WELL I THINK GOING BACK TO THIS. THE SAID TABLE. EVERYTHING I DON'T I SAY IT'S NOT THE ONLY SOLUTION BECAUSE I THINK THE. I CHALLENGES GREATER THAN ANY ONE SOLUTION. PROVIDES THE BENEFIT FOR SO IN OTHER WORDS. IF I'VE A THIRTEEN THOUSAND MEGAWATT JUST BENEATH CHO HAVE A FOURTEEN THOUSAND A WHAT RAMPING PROBLEM. I MAY BE ABLE SOLVE A PORTION OF THAT THROUGH REGIONALIZATION. BUT MAYBE I CAN SOLVE THE OTHER PORTION WITH. THREE THOUSAND MEGAWATTS OF STORAGE DEVICES. MAYBE FIVE MILLION ELECTRIC VEHICLES WHICH TRANSLATES INTO ABOUT THREE THOUSAND MEGAWATTS OF ADDITIONAL STORAGE MAYBE THAT CAN HELP PROVIDE SOME OF THE. SOLUTION. BUT WE HAVE TO DO SMART CHARGING. WITH THAT THAT THE RATES IN STRUCTURE. SUPPORT THAT. TIME OF USE RATES IF WE CAN GET THE MAN IN CALIFORNIA AND ELSEWHERE ACROSS THE WEST TO ACTUALLY BE RESPONSIVE TO THE PRICES IN THE SYSTEM CONDITIONS. YOU COULD ACTUALLY HAVE TIMES WHERE WE WANT TO HAVE THEM REDUCE LOW DURING THAT EVENING RAMP. OTHER TIMES WHEN WE HAVE TOO MUCH SUPPLY THAT'S WHEN WE SHOULD ACTUALLY BE RAMPING UP THEIR LOAD INCREASING THEIR PRODUCTION. OF WIDGETS OR WHATEVER THEY'RE MAKING MANUFACTURING AT THAT TIME A VERY LOW COST. OF ENERGY. WE NEED TO HAVE THE RENEWABLES THEMSELVES. I KNOW THE RENEWABLE GOAL IS IN TERMS OF RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STANDARD RENEWABLE ENERGY THAT'S THE MEASURE. BUT WE ACTUALLY HAVE TO HAVE THE RENEWABLES NOW STEP BACK AND SAY THERE'S TIMES WHERE WE DON'T WANT HIM TO PRODUCE ENERGY. WE ACTUALLY WANT HIM TO HOLD BACK SO WE CAN GET SOME OF THE ESSENTIAL RELIABILITY SERVICES. SO WE DON'T HAVE TO RELY AS MUCH ON THE GAS RESOURCES FOR THOSE ESSENTIAL RELIABILITY SERVICES. AND THAT WOULD BE A HELP PART OF THE SOLUTION. SO THOSE OF THE OTHER SUITE OF SOLUTIONS AND I I GOT A POINT. CALIFORNIA IS INCREDIBLY INNOVATIVE. THERE ARE A LOT OF INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS I'VE SEEN AND HEARD. THIS IS THE BEST PLACE YOU CAN HAVE TO DEVELOP THOSE INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS WE LOOK FORWARD TO DIVERT HELPING DEVELOP THOSE AND SHOW HOW THAT THAT THIS CAN BE DONE. NOT JUST FOR CALIFORNIA BUT SHOW HOW CAN BE DONE FOR THE WEST. IN A I THINK I'LL JUST ADD TO THAT BY SAYING IF YOU GO BACK TO ONE OF MARC SLIDES WERE TALKED ABOUT HOW THE NGUYEN DISAPPEARED AS SOME IN THE COURT POINTED OUT. WHEN THINGS YOU SEE ABOUT LOOKING AT THIS WE TO SOLUTIONS IS THEN THE DIVERSIFICATION. OF THE RESOURCES THAT WERE RELYING ON SO IT'S NOT JUST WIND AND SOLAR IT'S ACTUALLY RELYING ON THESE THINGS AS OTHER WAYS TO BALANCE LOW TO RESOURCES. BY THE WAY WE TALK ABOUT DIVERSITY WERE TALKING ABOUT TECHNOLOGICAL DIVERSITY AND GEOGRAPHICAL DIVERSITY SO IT MATTERS WHERE THE RESOURCES ARE AT. FOR EXAMPLE THE WIND IN WYOMING OR NEW MEXICO. IT ACTION MATTERS WHAT TYPE OF TECHNOLOGY SOME OF THE SHOULD BE GEOTHERMAL SOME OF THE SHOULD BE. WIN SOME OF US SHOULD BE SOLAR. THE DIVERSITY RESOURCES WILL HELP FILL IN THAT SHAPE OF LOAD. IF IT'S ALL ONE RESOURCE YOU'LL JUST GET THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY. LOAD COVERED IN FACT HOPE TO MUCH SUPPLY AND USE YOU'LL MISS THE PERIODS OF TIME WHEN THE SUN GOES DOWN. IN THE END IT. IN A REGIONAL REGIONAL LIES GRID AS ENERGY IS SHARED. OR THE POSSIBILITIES AND LIMITS REGARDING TRACKING THE DISPATCHED ENERGY. I MF SUMMER EXAMPLE CALIFORNIA HAS A HIGHER STANDARD. THING UTAH. CLEARLY. BUT BEFORE SHARING THE DISPATCHED ENERGY CAN WE SURE THAT WHAT WE'RE USING. COME THROUGH ZERO OR LIMITED THE MISSION SOURCE. REGIONALIZATION AND HAVING THE VISIBILITY INTO THE SPECIFIC RESOURCES PROVIDES A PATHWAY FOR BEING ABLE TO DO THAT. MORE THAN THE EXISTING METHOD DOES AND THE REASON IS BECAUSE WHEN I TELL YOU WHEN I TELL YOU THERE'S. TEN THOUSAND MEGAWATTS OF IMPORTS A LARGE PORTION OF THOSE IMPORTS ARE UNSPECIFIED RESOURCES. I DON'T KNOW TODAY WHAT IS BEHIND THEM. IT MAY BE HYDRO IN MAY BE. GAS. I DON'T KNOW WELL BEHIND THEM IT MAY BE COOL. UNDER REGIONALIZATION WE WOULD PUT IN A TRACKING SYSTEM THAT WOULD BE MORE RESOURCE SPECIFIC BASED. THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO DETERMINE SIMILAR TO THE WAY WE DO AND ENERGY IMBALANCE MARKET AND ALL ADMIT THEN YOU BOUNCE MARKET WAS A LEARNING. OPPORTUNITY THERE SOME ENHANCEMENTS THAT WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO DO. BUT IT PROVIDES A PATHWAY FOR TRACKING. RESOURCE. DELIVERIES TO SERVE LOAN CALIFORNIA AND THAT ALLOWS US TO TRACK WHAT IS SERVING OUR LOW. BUT AGAIN ALL AT FROM A FUNDAMENTAL STANDPOINT WHAT HAPPENS WITH THE MULTI STATE I SO IS NOW WE ARE OPERATING EVERY GENERATOR AND WE KNOW WHAT EVERY GENERATOR IS DOING WITHIN THAT FOOTPRINT. WHEN WE LOOK AT TO HOW E. I. M. IS STRUCTURED THE AYE AMENITIES HAVE AN OPTION TO ELECT. WHICH RESOURCES THEY WANT TO PARTICIPATE IN THAT MARKET. AND SO HAD A VERY SIMPLE WAY TO ANSWER QUESTION YOU GET. ALMOST A HUNDRED PERCENT TRANSPARENCY IN KNOWING EXACTLY WHAT GENERATORS ARE RUNNING BECAUSE NOW THE SYSTEM OPERATOR SEES WHAT EACH UNIT IS DOING. I JUST WANT TO ADD THAT THIS IS THIS QUESTION IS LIKE. COMPLEX SOLUTION. BECAUSE. WHY WE TRACKED THE GHG CONTENT TO SERVE CALIFORNIA LOAD? I ALSO HAVE TO BE RESPECTFUL OF THAT THE OTHER STATES ARE NOT TRACKING THAT OR MAY NOT HAVE THE SAME FROM THEIR PERSPECTIVE I HAVE TO MAKING SURE THAT. THERE LOW AND THERE OUGHT TO THEIR GENERATION IT'S SERVING THEIR LOAD. IS NOT. FACTORING IN THE JEEP SHE CONTENT BUT THE CALIFORNIA LOAD. AND HOW WE SERVE THAT IS FACTORING THE JEEP SHE CONTENT THAT MAKES A LITTLE BIT MORE COMPLEX AND MAKES A LITTLE MORE A CHALLENGING TO SOLVE. BUT I WILL SAY THE RELATION BECAUSE YOU'RE DOING RESOURCE PACIFIC IT ALLOWS FOR BETTER TRACKING METHOD. TO SERVE CALIFORNIA. AND FINALLY THERE WERE TWO COMMENTS YOU MADE AND I THINK LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING MORE OF THAT TURNED. HEARING MORE PROOF OF THAT. YOU BY REGIONALIZATION USE THAT CALIFORNIA CAN DE CARBONIZED OTHER AREAS OF THE WEST. I HOPE AND OTHER SECTORS. YES AND THE OTHER THAT WE CAN BE CARBONIZED ENERGY PRICES THOSE ARE TWO STATEMENTS ARE MADE AND. IMPORTANT STATEMENTS MIGHT LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING AND SEEING MORE OF THAT BEFORE THE SHOW. THANK YOU SIR IS HERE MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO DIVERSITY IS ONE OF THE UP BOXES YOU HAVE THERE IN ADDITION TO THAT IS. FLEXIBLE RESOURCES AND. TO BE BY NO SURPRISE OR NO. SECRET THAT MY INTERESTS IS TO SEE. A THESE TYPES OF FLEXIBLE RESOURCES AS YOU MENTIONED. SPREAD OUT. THE DIFFERENT GEOGRAPHIC AREAS. AND QUITE FRANKLY LOOKING AT IT FROM PERSPECTIVE BEFORE WE EVEN GO OUTSIDE OF THE STATE. WHAT ARE WE DOING TO MAXIMIZE THE OPPORTUNITIES WITH IN CALIFORNIA AND I REPRESENT AN AREA WITH A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF FLEXIBLE RESOURCES? OUT IN THE SONGS HE AREA. THAT OF DEBATE AND DISCUSSION FOR SEVERAL YEARS NOW. HAS BEEN HOW DO WE INTEGRATE. THAT RENEWABLE ENERGY AT TO THIS PORTFOLIO A DIVERSITY THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CAN YOU MAYBE ELABORATE A BIT. ON THAT IF A FLEXIBLE RESOURCES. YOU ARE LOOKING AT THESE TYPES OF RENEWAL THOUSAND DIFFERENT GEOGRAPHIC AREAS SO ABSOLUTELY AND IN FACT. WE WORK FOR THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES XIN TO. ENHANCE WHAT'S CALLED A RESOURCE ADEQUACY PROGRAM TO SUE EXPLICITLY RECOGNIZE THE NEED FOR FLEXIBLE RESOURCES IF NOT JUST A MATTER OF BASE LOAD RESOURCES. AND I THINK THAT IN PART MOVES THE INCENTIVE FOR. A FLEXIBLE RESOURCES TO EITHER DEVELOP OR BECOME MORE FLEXIBLE AS A RESULT OF THAT I KNOW SOME OF THE EVEN GAS RESOURCES HAVE BEEN. MADE. MODIFICATIONS TO MAKE THEM MORE FLEXIBLE WE'VE SHOWN HOW GEOTHERMAL CAN ACTUALLY BE A FLEXIBLE RESOURCE AND NOT BE A BASELOAD RESOURCE AND THAT PROVIDES US TO MAKE MORE ROOM ACTUALLY HELP DISPATCH. IN THE MIDDLE DAY IT CAN BE DONE IN MAY BE SLIGHTLY MORE EXPENSIVE THAT WE HAVE THE RESOURCES TO DO WE HAVE THE CAPABILITY. CAN CAN YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE OTHER. RENEWAL PULLED THAT IS SOMEWHAT CONTROVERSIAL BEING THAT. YOU KNOW BY MAIL JUSTICE COMMUNITIES FEEL THAT THEY ARE IMPACTED BUT BIOMASS. AND THE ROLE THAT THE IN A DIVERSIFIED PORTFOLIO. TIES YOU REFER TO A MAY PLAY. I I THINK THAT I THINK AND A DIVERSE SUPPORT PORTFOLIO AND A. WHO ALSO A IN CONJUNCTION WITH IT A? INTEGRATED RESOURCE PLAN PROVIDES THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT WHERE. AND WHAT TYPES OF RESOURCES YOU PLACE IN THE SYSTEM AND I THINK THAT AT THAT POINT. SHOULD AND I THINK COULD CONSIDER A DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE CONSIDERATIONS. AND I THING THE OTHER PARTY KWACHA'S AS WE. LOOK AT THE EXISTING GAS RESOURCES AND WHAT THOSE RESOURCES ARE DOING IN TERMS OF. DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES THERE'S OPPORTUNITY TO. POTENTIALLY REDUCE THE IMPACTS OF DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES THROUGH REGIONALIZATION WHICH SHOWED UP THROUGH THE SP THREE FIFTY STUDY WORK. OKAY THANK YOU. JUST TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT QUESTION AS WE TALK ABOUT THINGS LIKE BIOMASS AND THINGS ARE MORE EXPENSIVE AND HAVE SOME OF THE CONSEQUENCES BUT THEY ALSO HELP ADDRESS SOME OF OUR. AGAIN OTHER LARGE STATE ISSUES IN GOALS WILDFLOWERS IT DEVOLVE ISAAC THEY'RE CLEANING UP OUR OUR OUR FORESTS THAT WE DON'T DO A VERY GOOD JOB WITH WHAT OUR AGRICULTURE ECONOMY THAT CONTINUES TO HAVE. CUT TREES AND EVERYTHING HOW DO WE BALANCE THOSE THINGS WE'VE GOT. WE'VE GOT A LOT OF STOCK WE HAVE A LOT OF FUEL THAT WE NEED TO GET RID OF IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN OUR CLEAN AIR BIG MASSIVE FIRE. CAN BLOW ALL OF OUR OUR OTHER GOALS. A AND IF WE CONTINUE TO JUST LOOK FOR AGAIN THINGS THAT ARE MORE LESS EXPENSIVE FROM OTHER PLACES AND THEN. AGAIN WHAT DOES THAT DO HOW DO WE BALANCE ALL WERE CALIFORNIA GOALS. OR HOW ARE OUR CALVET EAGLES BALANCED IN A REGULATION APPROACH. YEAH OF I THINK I THINK YOU'VE HEARD BOTH OF US SAY IT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT POINT HERE THAT HAVING A REGIONAL ISO DOESN'T IN ANY WAY IMPINGE UPON STATE POLICY TO DO PROCUREMENT. SO TO THE EXTENT IT'S IN CALIFORNIA'S INTEREST TO BUILD MORE BIOMASS IN ORDER TO CARE FOR DYING FORCE AND SO FORTH. IT'S CERTAINLY WITHIN CALIFORNIA'S AUTHORITY TO DO THAT AND AS MARK DESCRIBE WHAT WE'RE DOING AND WHAT WE'RE SHOWING HERE IN A LOT OF THE SLICE IS JUST THE CHALLENGE WE HAVE IN DISPATCHING. SO I THINK I THINK ASSEMBLYMAN GARCIA'S QUESTION AROUND FLEXIBLE RESOURCES IS REALLY THE BEST AND EASIEST WAY TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION. WE GO BACK TO THE FUNDAMENTAL SET OF RESOURCES THAT. YOU CAN THINK ABOUT GOING FORWARD IS ALWAYS REMEMBER WE'RE GONNA NEED MORE FLEXIBILITY. AND SO WHEN MARKET SHOWN SOME OF THOSE GRAPHS WHERE THOSE BOTTOM AREAS ARE BASICALLY FLAT. LIKE THE CONVENTIONAL GEOTHERMAL FLEET WE HAVE TODAY THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY GOING TO BE HELPFUL WE'RE LOOKING FOR IS NEW TECHNOLOGIES LIKE FLEXIBLE GEOTHERMAL RESOURCES THAT CAN ALLOW YOU TO RAMP UP AND DOWN. AND SO THE BUILDING OUT OF BIOMASS FACILITIES NEEDS TO TRY TO AVOID BEING A CONVENTIONAL SORT OF BASELINE TYPE OF OPERATION AND ALLOW FOR DISABILITY TO MOVE UP AND DOWN IN THE COURSE OF THE DAY. AS WE BUILD THAT CONCEPT INTO THOSE PROCUREMENT POLICIES THEN YOU'VE GOT SOMETHING THAT ACTUALLY IS SUPPORTIVE FOR GREAT OPERATIONS. THANK YOU AND I THINK WHAT I'M ALSO INTERPRETING FROM WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS THAT YOU WOULD NEED SOME ADDITIONAL DIRECTION ON POLICY WHERE WE CAN MAYBE PUT MORE FOCUS ON. GEOTHERMAL AND HOW WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE IT INTEGRATED AND YOUR. RESPONSIBILITY THAT POINT WOULD BE TO DISPATCH IT. YEAH AND THAT'S WHERE I WAS SAYING MISTER CHAIRMAN SORT OF MY OPENING REMARKS HIS.* WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS BE HELPFUL TO YOU IN TERMS OF PROVIDING THIS KIND OF INFORMATION TO HELP GUIDE THAT SO YOU CAN SEE WHAT'S THE WORDS THE VALUE PROPOSITION. AS YOU START THINKING ABOUT WHAT'S THE A NEXT SET OF RESOURCES TRY MAKE SURE THOSE RESOURCES ARE ALIGNED WITH HOW THE SYSTEM LOOKS LIKE IT'S GOING TO BE OPERATING AND THE BILL GET THE BEST VALUE OUT OF THAT RESOURCE. THANK YOU WE APPRECIATE YOUR PRESENTATION VERY THOUGHTFUL AND VERY. WELL COVERED AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING STICK AROUND JUST IN CASE OR ANY QUESTIONS THAT MIGHT. COME UP DURING THE COURSE OF THE REST OF THIS HEARING NEVADA BUT IF I COULD I'D LIKE TO CALL THE SECOND PANEL FORWARD THIS IS ON THE PERSPECTIVES ON REGIONALIZATION AND AND ABA THIRTEEN. LORE WHISTLIN. SENIOR ENERGY ANALYSTS UNION OF CONCERNED SCIENTISTS. JANTZ MONEY JONES CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER INDEPENDENT ENERGY PRODUCERS ASSOCIATION. MATTHEW FRIEDMAN STAFF ATTORNEY UTILITY REFORM NETWORK. TONI BRAUN COUNCIL TO SEE A CALIFORNIA MUNICIPAL UTILITIES ASSOCIATION ROM POLICING SMITH AND. WE WELCOME ALL OF YOU. AND I GUESS WE CAN MAYBE PRESENT IN THE ORDER THAT YOUR NAME IS CULTURE AGO FIRST. SO GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU SO MUCH CHAIR HOLDING MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY I'M OR WHISTLING WITH THE UNION OF CONCERNED SCIENTISTS. AND I WANT TO FRAME MY COMMENTS BY SAYING YOU SEE YES IS COMMITTED TO DEVELOPING POLICIES IN CALIFORNIA THAT ARE GONNA MEANINGFULLY REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND TOXIC AIR POLLUTION. ASSOCIATE WITH THE POWER SECTOR. AND DOING IT IN A WAY THIS HAS A POSITIVE EXAMPLE FOR STATES AND OTHER COUNTRIES TO FOLLOW. SO IN MY MIND THIS MEANS MAKING SURE THAT THE CLEAN ENERGY TRANSITION THE CLEAN ENERGY TRANSITION. HAPPENS IN A WAY THAT DOESN'T SACRIFICE GRID RELIABILITY AND THAT KEEPS COSTS LOW. I'M HERE TODAY TALKING ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF A REGIONAL ENERGY MARKET. DESPITE ITS COMPLEXITY BECAUSE UCS BELIEVES THAT IT IS A VERY MEANINGFUL TOOL FOR INTEGRATING MUCH LARGER QUANTITIES OF RENEWABLES. BEYOND WHAT WE'RE CURRENTLY PLANNING FOR AND WHAT WE BELIEVE WERE ULTIMATELY NEED TO PROCURE IN ORDER TO MAKE A MEANINGFUL THEN ON CLIMATE CHANGE. THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT IF WE WANT TO GO FASTER AND FARTHER ON RENEWABLES WE NEED TO SERIOUSLY CONSIDER THE BENEFITS THAT A REGIONAL MARKET PROVIDES. AS I SO MENTIONED THE MOST IMPORTANT THING WE CAN DO TO INTEGRATE LARGE QUANTITIES OF RENEWABLES IS TO INCREASE FLEXIBILITY OF THE SYSTEM. AND CREATE MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR GRID OPERATORS TO SHIFT RESOURCES AROUND TO MEET THE CHANGING NEEDS OF THE GREG. SO THE I SAW MENTION THIS BUT I JUST WANT TO STRESS THAT. THERE ARE SEVERAL DIFFERENT STRATEGIES WERE GONNA NEED TO DEPLOY TO GET TO LARGE QUANTITIES OF RENEWABLES ON THE GRADE AND TO GET TO A LOW CARBON OR ZERO CARBON ELECTRICITY FUTURE. A WESTERN GRADE IS NOT A SILVER BULLET AND SHOULD NOT DETRACT IN ANY WAY FROM THE VERY IMPORTANT EFFORTS OUR STATE IS UNDERTAKING TO DO THINGS LIKE. BUILD MORE ENERGY STORAGE AND LOCAL DISTRIBUTED ENERGY RESOURCES TO REDUCE CONGESTION TO MAKE THE GRID MORE RESILIENT. TO REDUCE THE NEED TO RELY ON NATURAL GAS SPEAKER PLANTS ESPECIALLY ONES AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. ALSO THINGS LIKE SHIFTING MORE ELECTRICITY DEMAND TOWARDS TIME WHEN RENEWABLES ARE MOST ABUNDANT OR TARGET ENERGY EFFICIENCY TO THE EVENING HOURS WHICH WILL HELP REDUCE THE NEED TO SUDDENLY RAMP UP ANOTHER RESOURCE WHEN WE LOSE OUR SOLAR. GENERATION. BUT IT WERE TRULY COMMITTED TO RAMPING UP RENEWABLES IN A MAJOR WAY WE NEED TO ALSO EXPAND THE CAPABILITIES OF GRID OPERATORS TO SHARE GENERATION AND TRANSMISSION RESOURCES THROUGHOUT A WIDER FOOTPRINT. THE BIGGEST BENEFITS IN MY MIND EVER REGIONAL GRADE TO CALIFORNIA REPAIRS AND THE ENVIRONMENT ARE NUMBER ONE A REGIONAL GRADE MAKES IT EASIER TO ACCESS LESS FLEXIBLE GENERATION FROM A LARGER POOL OF RESOURCES. WHICH IS ESSENTIAL TO BRINGING ON ONLINE MUCH LARGER QUANTITIES OF RENEWABLES. NUMBER TWO IT HELPS US UTILIZED LOW COST RENEWABLES AND OTHER STATES THAT WILL COMPLEMENT OUR AMAZING SOLAR RESOURCE BOTH THE LARGE AND THE SMALL SCALE PVP THAT WE CAN AND SHOULD FAILED. NUMBER THREE IT HELPS US ACCESS A LARGER MARKET TO ABSORB THE SOLAR GENERATION THAT'S IN ACCESS TO WHAT CALIFORNIA CUSTOMERS CAN CONSUMER WHAT'S COST EFFECTIVE TO STORE. THESE OTHER TOOLS THAT I MENTIONED BEFORE ENERGY STORAGE FLEXIBLE THE MAN THEY'RE INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT SOURCES OF FLEXIBILITY AND WILL LIKELY BE EVEN MORE IMPORTANT THAN A REGIONAL MARKET. FOR ACCOMPLISHING CERTAIN CLIMATE AND ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE JUSTICE OBJECTIVES LIKE REDUCING THE NEED TO RELY ON SPECIFIC IN STATE NATURAL GAS PLANTS TO PROVIDE LOCAL CAPACITY. BUT I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE AN EFFECTIVE AND COST EFFECTIVE SUBSTITUTE FOR PROVIDING THE SYSTEM FLEXIBILITY. WE'RE GONNA NEED ON A DAILY BASIS WHEN THE SUN GOES DOWN WE LOSE OUR SOLAR. AND THAT'S WHAT A REGIONAL MARKET CAN DO. I ALSO WANT TO QUICKLY SPEAK TO SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT A WESTERN GRADE COULD MEAN CALIFORNIA GETS MORE OF ITS ELECTRICITY FROM COAL FROM FROM WESTERN COAL PLANTS. AS YOU KNOW WE'VE ALREADY IMPLEMENTED THAT WE'VE ALREADY IMPLEMENTED A VERY STRONG POLICY THE EMISSIONS PERFORMANCE STANDARD TO PROHIBIT LOAD SERVING AND HE'S HERE. FROM IT RENEWING LONG TERM CONTRACTS WITH INDIVIDUAL COAL PLANTS AND THAT'S BEEN A HUGE DRIVER AND REDUCING COAL THAT WE CONSUME. BUT COAL GENERATION ALSO MAKES IT TO CALIFORNIA BY WAVE UNSPECIFIED MARKET PURCHASES FOR BUNDLES OF ELECTRICITY WHICH IS DIFFERENT FROM ELECTRICITY PURCHASES FROM INDIVIDUAL PLANTS I KNOW WE TOUCH ON THAT BRIEFLY IN THE LAST. SET OF COMMENTS. ONE THING WE CAN DO ABOUT THIS WHICH HAS BEEN THE MOST IMPORTANT DRIVER FOR COAL PLANT RETIREMENTS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. IS EXPOSED THAT COAL GENERATION TO MORE MARKET COMPETITION FROM CHEAPER RESOURCES LIKE RENEWABLES. HAVING ACCESS TO A WESTERN REGIONAL ENERGY MARKET IS GOING TO MAKE IT MUCH EASIER FOR CALIFORNIA TO GO FARTHER AND FASTER WITH RENEWABLES. AND THAT IN TURN OVER TIME IS GONNA HELP DRIVE COOL OFF THE WESTERN GRADE. EXPANDING THE FOOTPRINT AYE SO ALSO HAS THE BENEFIT OF ADDED TRANSPARENCY THE CALL THE CURLY MAKES IT TO CALIFORNIA'S UNSPECIFIED WOULD HAVE TO BE DISCLOSED IF THE PLANTS WERE LOCATED IN A WESTERN AYSO. RIGHT NOW ARE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM ASSIGNS UNSPECIFIED MARKET PURCHASES A CARBON ADDER THAT'S LESS THAN COAL BECAUSE WE CAN'T ACTUALLY SEE WHICH PLANTS ARE PROVIDING THAT GENERATION. IF WE CAN SEE THE COAL WE CAN ACCURATELY SIGN THE RIGHT CARBON VALUE TO THAT ELECTRICITY. A CLOSE JUST BY SAYING THAT THESE ARE COMPLICATED ISSUES WE'RE DISCUSSING THAT REQUIRE WE HAVE MEANINGFUL OPPORTUNITIES TO DEBATE. AND ALSO TO CRYSTALLIZE THE BOTTOM LINES FOR CALIFORNIA THAT WOULD ABSOLUTELY NEED TO HAVE TO BE INTACT IF WE WERE TO CREATE A WESTERN ISO. AND I THINK THAT ABA A THIRTEEN IS CREATING A MEANINGFUL OPPORTUNITY WITH THE RIGHT DUE PROCESS TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION. AND AT THIS POINT I THINK THE BILL LANGUAGE HAS A VERY SOLID FOUNDATION FOR ARTICULATING HOW WE WOULD PRESERVE OUR VALUES. AND PROTECT OUR ABILITY TO CAN SEE IT TECH CONTINUE PURSUING OUR CLIMATE AGENDA THANKS. THANK YOU BUDGETS MONEY JONES REPRESENTING THE INDEPENDENT ENERGY PRODUCERS. AND. WE REPRESENT DAY. VAST ARRAY OF TECHNOLOGIES THAT. ACTUALLY HAVE INVESTED TENS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN CALIFORNIA TO MEET OUR CA. AGREEING CLIMATE GOALS AND THESE INCLUDE WIND. UTILITY SCALE SOLAR GEOTHERMAL BIOMASS AND THE GAS LEAKED OUT THAT HAS BEEN MODERNIZE TO LOWER ITS CARBON. FOOTPRINT. AS WE ARE TO MEET RAMPS AND OTHER NEEDS HERE IN CALIFORNIA SO WE APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY I MISTER CHAIRMAN TO. AB PRESENT OUR SUPPORT FOR A PROPERLY STRUCTURED. REGIONAL MARKET TO HELP ME CALIFORNIA'S GREEN FUTURE THINK THIS CAN BE DONE AND I ALSO WANT TO THANK YOU FOR. AB. A THIRTEEN SO WHILE IT'S A WORK IN PROGRESS THAT SUBJECT AT THIS. PACIFIC HEARING TODAY AYE IT DOES PROVIDE SOME FOCUS. TO TAKE THIS DISCUSSION FROM THE ABSTRACT WHICH WE'VE HAD. A COUPLE YEARS OF. TO ACTUALLY HAVING THE DEBATE ABOUT WORDS ON PAPER SO I THINK IT'LL HELP FOCUS THINGS AND I LOOK FORWARD TO THAT I THINK THE STAFF BACKGROUND MATERIAL DID A VERY GOOD JOB GIVING DE COMEDIAN OVERVIEW. HOW THE SYSTEM WORKS AND WHAT'S IMPORTANT THERE AT THE DIET SO DID A GOOD JOB OF EXPLAINING? EXACTLY WHAT THE. THE ISSUES THAT THEY FACE ARE. AYE WHAT JUST WANNA START UP QUICKLY BY SAYING. THERE'S CERTAIN THINGS HERE THAT. ARE NOT NEW OKAY SO THE REGIONAL ENERGY MARKETS. BASICALLY ARE NOT NEW AT ALL THEY WENT TO A FACT OVER FIFTY YEARS AGO SO MATTER FACT PRESIDENT KENNEDY IN NINETEEN SIXTY ONE ORDERED AS A PLANNED AND INCORPORATED NORTHWEST WITH CALIFORNIAN THE SOUTHWEST. I KNOW THERE'S MAYBE ONLY TEN PEOPLE IN THE ROOM THAT WERE AROUND THEN BUT DOT THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED. CONGRESS DID APPROPRIATE MONEY AND WE DID BUILD A TRANSMISSION SYSTEM THAT. INCLUDE TO AC LEADS IN THE DC LIVE IN THE NORTHWEST AND WE ARE INTERCONNECTED AS WELL TO THE EAST OF US I'D TO ARIZONA NEVADA. SO THE STRUCTURE HAS BEEN THERE THE WIRES HAVE BEEN THERE FOR A LONG TIME. AND. THE. YOU KNOW THIS IS ALL IN INTERSTATE MARKET IT'S BEEN THERE FOR THAT PERIOD OF TIME IT HAS BEEN SUBJECT TO THE COMMERCE CLAUSE IN THE FEDERAL POWER ACT AND ALL THE THINGS THAT GO WITH INTERSTATE MARKETS. SO THAT'S A BE I THINK AS YOU HEARD EARLIER ONE OF THEM DIDN'T MAIN DRIVERS FOR THAT AT THE TIME. I WAS AT THE NORTHWEST IS A WINTER PEAKING ENTITY MEETING DATE THEY HEAT THEIR HOMES WITH ELECTRICITY SO THEY PEAK IN THE WINTER. CALIFORNIA THE SOUTHWEST IT I HAVE AIR CONDITIONING LOADS WE PEAK IN THE SUMMER. AND SO WAS A WITH A WAY TO BASICALLY MOVE THIS POWER BACK AND FORTH WITH A LOT WHICH ALLOWED US BUT NOT OVERBILLED OUR SYSTEMS TO MEET OUR NEEDS WE IMPORT ABOUT TWENTY FIVE TO THIRTY PERCENT OF OUR POWER. WHICH I OBVIOUSLY HAD COST ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH IT. THIS PARALLELS DISCUSSION WE HAVE BEEN ALL GOING TO LITTLE MORE DETAIL. WITH WHAT'S GOING ON TODAY WITH THAT BASICALLY SOLAR BEING ABLE TO EXPORT IT WHEN WE DON'T NEED IT. OR WERE IN ACCESS AND ALSO TO IMPORT WIND WHEN IT MAY BE AVAILABLE IN OTHER REGIONS. IN HELP US BEAT SOBRE PEEKING OPPORTUNITIES. TWENTY YEARS AGO. A MARCH THIRTY FIRST SO THERE'S A BIRTHDAY COMING UP THE AYE AYE SO WENT LIVE. I THINK YOU'RE PRETTY GOOD. EXPLANATION OF WHAT IT IS STATE DO IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE BORING CALLASPO'S TO KEEP SYSTEM AT SIXTY HERTZ TO KEEP US FROM BEING SERBIA BUT APPARENTLY IT'S GOTTEN MUCH MORE INTERESTING OVER LAST OVER YEARS. WE WHAT WE BELIEVE IS IMPORTANT AS THEY ARE AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLER OF ELECTRONS THEY DON'T OWN THE TRANSMISSION SYSTEM THEY HAVE NO ECONOMIC INTEREST IN THAT. INFORMED US THAT IS INDEPENDENT POWER PRODUCERS THAT ACTUALLY DEVELOPED NGUYEN PLANTS AND SOLAR PLANTS IN JUNE THERMAL PLANTS GAS PLANTS. NOT HAVING THE TRANSMISSION SYSTEM GAINED IN USE BY THE TRANSMISSION OWNER AWAY THE COULD DETAILS. ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COMPETITION WAS CRITICAL. SO IT HAD A MAJOR IMPACT ON. AND BASICALLY OPENING UP CALIFORNIA TO BE ABLE TO EXPAND OUR NOBLE BASE. IN OUR OTHER. OTHER CLEAN RESOURCES I IN IN MEETING OUR NEEDS. AS YOU HEARD CALIFORNIA HE AYE SO DOES NOT INITIATE POLICY. IT'S DONE A GOOD JOB OF INTEGRATING WHAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS SENT TO IT OVER THE YEARS A TERMS OF POLICIES WE WOULD EXPECT THEM TO CONTINUE TO DO THAT. HAZARD AS A METAL INDICATES IT IS FOR IT REGULATED AND THE AYE IN. A CALIFORNIA INDEPENDENT SYSTEM OPERATOR MEANS SAID IT A IT'S NOT A STATE AGENCY AND IT'S NOT COMMERCIALLY OWNED BY ANYBODY SO THAT INDEPENDENCE IS VERY IMPORTANT. MOVING FORWARD THE BENEFITS AS WE SEE A IN ITS NOT ONLY ONE SOLUTION AS I THINK AT PEOPLE HAVE INDICATED EARLIER. IT DOES ALLOW US TO. BASICALLY. BETTER MANAGE OUR PORTFOLIO. WHICH ALLOWS US IS. SHOULD MISTER PATTERSON IT INDICATED TO. EXPORT EXES RENEWABLES WHEN IT NECESSARY I'LL ADD I THINK. MISS WHISTLING JUST ALREADY. YEAH HIT UPON THIS. IS IT ALSO HAS THE POTENTIAL DISPLACING FALSO RESOURCES. ELSEWHERE IN THE WEST OTHER CHRISTIAN WEST ISN'T GOING TO D. CARBONIZED BECAUSE CALIFORNIA TELLS THEM TO. BUT THEY WILL BUY CHEAP ELECTRONS FROM US AND JUDGE SO I THINK THAT THAT'S A A REAL OPPORTUNITY THERE. IT ALLOWS US TO ACCESS LOWER COST RENEWABLES AS I SAID THERE ARE NGUYEN RESOURCES THAT MAY NOT CURRENTLY BE AVAILABLE TO CALIFORNIA BECAUSE LACKEY TRANSMISSION. ABOUT MAYBE IN ABOUT A AVAILABLE IN THE FUTURE AS MS RIVLIN INDICATED IT WILL IMPROVE TRANSPARENCY FROM THE STANDPOINT OF THE I SO WILL KNOW WHAT'S BEING DISPATCHED. THE WHAT IMPACT. AND WE'RE EXPECTING THAT THE CORPORATE GOVERNANCE OF. THIS ENTITY REMAINS. REMAINS INDEPENDENT AS IT IS TODAY. AND THAT THEY'LL BE COMPARABLE ACCESS TO THE. GRID AS AT ALSO AS THERE IS TODAY. SO THE IT THAT THE YOU KNOW THAT WE ALSO BELIEVE COMBAT ALL THESE THINGS COMBINED WILL HELP LOWER THE COST OF BEING OUR CARBON GOALS IN THE FUTURE AND I THINK THAT'S KEY. A IN TERMS OF TRIED TO MEET THE OF THESE GOALS WHICH WE WHOLEHEARTEDLY SUPPORT BUT IN A MANNER THAT THAT LOWERS THE COST. THE IMPORTANT POINT HERE IS. THE ROLE OF THE STATE IN THAT. IN THAT REGIONAL MARKET. AND CALIFORNIA WILL CONTINUE HAVE CONTROL OVER ITS RESOURCE DECISIONS LIKE THE OUR PS. THE ENERGY EFFICIENCY STORE YOU SEE WHEN YOU ENACT LEGISLATION THAT. YOU ARE SENSITIVE TO THE COMMERCE CLAUSE AND OTHER THINGS YOU WRITE THEM SMARTLY AND CALIFORNIA SO FAR HAS DONE AT OUR PS WE SPEND LOT OF TIME. MAKING SURE THAT IT COMPLIES WITH THE COMMERCE CLAUSE IN IN THE PAST SEVEN YEARS NO ONE'S CHALLENGED IT OKAY SO I THINK WE'RE PRETTY WELL ON OUR WAY DOWN THE ROAD. AND WHILE THE WORDS CHIEF JUSTICE MONEY JONES WILL NEVER LEAVE ANYBODY SLIPS I'M PRETTY CONFIDENT THAT IT WOULD WHICH WITHSTAND. CONSTITUTIONAL SCRUTINY SO I I THINK THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT THAT'S THEIR CALL IT CALIFORNIA WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE CONTROL OVER IT CO TWO POLICY AND THAT'S BEEN CHALLENGED INTO A BIT CALIFORNIA ONE ON THAT. I CALIFORNIA. IT HAS CONTROL OVER TRANSMISSION CITING AND. RESOURCE. PLANNING IT HAS. IT IT HAS CONTROL OVER CITING OF GENERATION. IT WITHIN ITS BORDERS IT SETS RETAIL RATES ID HAS RETAIL PROGRAMS. THE AP HAS TAX POLICIES THAT IT THAT IT SO ALL OF THOSE THINGS DID YOU DO TODAY YOU COULD CONTINUE TO DO IN THE FUTURE AND THAT'S IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE. THE EXPANDED I ALSO. AND I JUST WANNA MAKE THIS CLEAR TO EVERYBODY. WILL NOT AFFECT CALIFORNIA'S ABILITY TO PURSUE ITS POLICY GOALS IN THE FUTURE I'M YEAH I AND. CALIFORNIA WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE CONTROL OVER ITS POLICIES AS I SAID IT IS AGAIN THE LAWS LONGER CONSISTENT WITH. THE COMMERCE CLAUSE IN THE FEDERAL POWER ACT WHICH IS YOU KNOW WOULD WHICH IS WHAT THE. STATUS IS TODAY AND ALWAYS HAS BEEN AND SO I THINK THAT'S A POSITIVE THING. AND. CALIFORNIA WILL YOU KNOW CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD IN BEING ABLE TO MOVE ITS POLICIES AND IN WAYS THAT I THINK ARE. WILL HOPE IS MEET OUR FUTURE SO. THE WE. YOU KNOW OUR SUPPORT FOR THIS OUT OF ME TO BELIEVE THAT THIS WILL GIVE US. IT YOU KNOW EXPANDED. ABILITY TO ACCESS ADDITIONAL. RESOURCES FROM NOT ONLY AROUND THE REGION BUT ALLOW US TO EXPORTS OF THE INDIGENOUS RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE HERE. IN IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHICH IS NOT JUST SOLAR AND IT'S NOT JUST WIND ITS BIOMASS IT'S YOU'LL THERMAL THAT SOME OF THESE OTHER RESOURCES THAT ARE FOUNDATIONAL TO OUR MARKET. SO JUST IN CLOSING. WE BELIEVE THAT THE GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE OBVIOUSLY OF AN EXPANDED ISO IS OF CRITICAL IMPORTANCE. WE BELIEVE THAT. AB ERA EIGHT THIRTEEN IS PROVIDING A FRAMEWORK TO HAVE A DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT ARE DILIGENT OF LEGITIMATE GOVERNANCE ISSUES THAT ARE ACTUALLY ASSOCIATED WITH THAT. AND I THINK THERE ARE THE POLICY IMPLICATIONS THAT COULD BE TAKEN UP IN OTHER LEGISLATION THAT ARE YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT WHEN THAT IS APPROPRIATE. TO THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY. THANK YOU. DID YOU HAVE A QUESTION FOR THAT THAT THE SUMMER YOU CAN WAY OKAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF COMMITTEE MATT FRIEDMAN ON BEHALF OF THE UTILITY REFORM NETWORK. I'M I'M HERE TO SAY THAT TURNED SUPPORTS GREATER REGIONAL COORDINATION. BUT WE DON'T SUPPORT THE PROPOSAL FOR EYES SO REGIONAL EXPANSION. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THAT CALIFORNIA IS ALREADY PART OF A REGIONAL MARKET. TRADING OF ELECTRICITY HAPPENED THROUGHOUT THE WEST EVERY HOUR OF EVERYDAY THAT INVOLVES CALIFORNIA. ENGAGE COORDINATION. IT'S WHETHER CALIFORNIA SHOULD GIVE UP MEANING FULL CONTROL OVER THE CALIFORNIA INDEPENDENT SYSTEM OPERATOR. AND CONTRAST TO THE WISE COMMENTS A CHIEF JUSTICE MONEY JONES TO MY LEFT. I DON'T SEE. A COMPELLING VALUE PROPOSITION THE CHI SO EXPANSION BUT WE DO SEE SERIOUS POTENTIAL DOWNSIDE RISKS THAT MUST BE UNDERSTOOD BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE MAKES A DECISION THAT CANNOT EASILY BE REVERSED. BASED ON THE REVIEW OF THE STUDIES THAT WE'VE DONE. WE'RE CONCERNED THAT REGIONAL EXPANSION COULD LEAD TO HIGHER COSTS FOR CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS A GREATER UTILIZATION OF COAL AND GAS FIRED POWER PLANTS HIGHER IN STATE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS FEWER IN STATE JOBS. AND AN INCREASED RISK THAT CUTTING EDGE STATE POLICIES THAT WE'VE ALL INVESTED A LOT OF TIME TO DEVELOP. MIGHT BE SUBJECT A FEDERAL PREEMPTION. THE RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STANDARD PROGRAM IN ADDITION ON IS POTENTIALLY AT RISK BECAUSE REGIONAL EXPANSION WOULD IRREVOCABLY MAKE SUBSTANTIAL MODIFICATIONS TO KEY ELEMENTS OF THAT PROGRAM. THAT COULD RESULT IN LESS NEW RENEWABLE ENERGY DEVELOPMENT. AND GREATER RELIANCE ON RENEWABLE ENERGY THAT IS NEVER ACTUALLY USED TO SERVE CALIFORNIA AND THEREBY PRODUCES FEWER IN STATE ENVIRONMENTAL AND PUBLIC HEALTH BENEFITS. THIS IS A ONE WAY TICKET THAT CAN'T BE UNWOUND OF CALIFORNIA WANTS OUT LATER. IT WOULD HAVE TO SPEND YEARS AND HUGE SUMS OF MONEY TO RECONSTRUCT AN ENTIRELY SEPARATE AND NEW WHOLESALE MARKET MECHANISM AND THAT'S PROBABLY NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. OUR PRIMARY CONCERN REALLY IS THAT ELIMINATING THE GOVERNOR APPOINTED. STATE SENATE CONFIRMED BOARD WOULD BE A MISTAKE.THE CURRENT STRUCTURE REQUIRES THE I SO TO BE ACCOUNTABLE TO STATE INTERESTS AND TO ELECTED OFFICIALS LIKE ALL OF YOU. THE EXPANSION OF THE AYE SO INVOLVES ELIMINATING ANY SPECIFIC ROLE FOR CALIFORNIA'S ELECTED OFFICIALS OR REGULATORS. IN SELECTING THE GOVERNANCE OR OVERSEEING THE ISO AND UNDER A RESTRUCTURED ENTITY. ALL OF YOU AND REGULATORS ARE STATE AGENCIES WOULD BE RELEGATED TO SIMPLY PROVIDING INPUT. ALONG WITH OTHER GOVERNMENT AND INDUSTRY STAKEHOLDERS FROM ACROSS THE WEST IN AFFECT YOUR VIEWS WOULD BECOME ONLY MARGINALLY RELEVANT. AND THIS BILL THAT YOU WERE ASKED TO PASS IT COMES TO A VOTE WOULD BE LITERALLY THE LAST BILL YOU'LL EVER GET TO VOTE ON THAT HAS A DIRECT IMPACT ON THE I SO BECAUSE IT WOULD NO LONGER BE SUBJECT. STATE OVERSIGHT. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT POINT TO UNDERSTAND IT'S A ONE WAY TICKET AND YOU HAVE ONE CHANCE TO DECIDE WHETHER IT SHOULD GO FORWARD. AND UNDER REGIONAL AYE SO IF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE HAS ANY CONCERNS. WELL THEY CAN SEND A LETTER TO THE ISO. OR YOU CAN FILE COMMENTS WITH THE FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION WERE PRESIDENT TRUMP'S APPOINTEES WILL BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO CONSIDER WHETHER CALIFORNIA'S VIEWS ARE VALID. IN TWENTY SIXTEEN. WHEN THE FIRST PROPOSAL FOR AYE AS A REGIONALIZATION CIRCULATED THERE WAS AN IDEA OF A WESTERN STATES COMMITTEE WERE CALIFORNIA WOULD ACTUALLY HAVE A VOTE ON KEY POLICIES. THAT WOULD BE CONSIDERED BY THE ISO WELL THAT'S GONE ON IN THAT FORMAT THE LATEST VERSION AND EIGHTY EIGHT THIRTEEN APPEARS TO RELEGATE THAT COMMITTEE TO SIMPLY PROVIDING INPUT. WELL BE ALL PROVIDE INPUT TO DECISION MAKERS AND IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THEY A THAT IT'S A MEANINGFUL FORM OF AND PUT. IT DOESN'T PROVIDE ANY BINDING FORM OF CONTROL. SO WHY ARE WE CONCERNED ABOUT THIS BECAUSE WE THINK THAT EXPANDING THE I SO DOES INCREASE THE RISK OF LITIGATION AND PREEMPTION OF CALIFORNIA STATE POLICIES. COM RIGHT NOW CALIFORNIA HAS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN DISSUADING THE I SO AND ITS BOARD FROM APPROVING BAD MARKET MECHANISMS THAT CAN FRUSTRATE CALIFORNIA'S POLICY INITIATIVES. I'M THAT ROLE WAS GONE UNDER A REGIONAL HAS SO. AND THE REGIONAL AYE SO WOULD DEVELOP MECHANISMS THAT RESPOND TO NEEDS AND OTHER PARTS OF THE REGION. SOME OF THOSE MECHANISMS MAY VERY WELL CONFLICT WITH CALIFORNIA'S POLICIES AND PRACTICES. ORIGINAL ISO WOULD ALSO INCLUDE MANY STAKEHOLDERS OPPOSED TO CALIFORNIA'S POLICIES. IT WOULD BE DIRECTLY AFFECTED BY THEM AS PART OF A SINGLE INTEGRATED WHOLESALE MARKET. RIGHT NOW. CALIFORNIA CAN'T BE FORCED TO SUBSIDIZE COAL FIRED POWER PLANTS IN UTAH OR WYOMING. BUT. IF WE'RE ALL PART OF THE SAME REGIONAL GRADE. IN THE SAME REGIONAL MARKET THAT ACTUALLY PROVIDES A MECHANISM FOR THE FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION TO DO WHAT IT'S INDICATED IT'S INTERESTED. WHICH IS TO PROVIDE NEW SUBSIDY MECHANISMS FOR EXISTING COAL FIRED POWER PLANTS. AND FOR ALL USERS OF THE SAME REGIONAL TRANSMISSION OPERATOR TO PAY FOR THAT. WHEN YOU BRING IN A BUDGET COAL PLANTS INTO YOUR. INTO YOUR WHOLESALE MARKET UNDER THE SAME RTO YOU HAVE ACTUALLY PROVIDED A PATHWAY FOR FORCING THOSE KINDS OF OUTCOMES. AND WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT COURTS ARE LIKELY TO PROVIDE GREATER SCRUTINY. STATE POLICIES THAT AFFECT WHOLESALE MARKETS WHEN THE STATE'S ARE PART OF A SINGLE REGIONAL TRANSMISSION OPERATOR. AND IN FACT ONE OF OUR POTENTIAL PARTNERS IN THE REGIONAL GRADE THE STATE OF UTAH. HAS JUST INCLUDED THEIR LEGISLATURE IN THEIR STATE BUDGET ONE POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS TO SUE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA OVER ITS GREENHOUSE GAS POLICIES. THEY'RE READY TO GO TO SEE WHAT'S UNDER THE CURRENT PARADIGM AND MY VIEW IS THAT EXPANDING THE I SO ACTUALLY GIVES THEM A GREATER CHANCE OF SUCCESS. TO APPLY OUR POLICIES AS PART OF THE FORK REGULATED SINGLE WHOLESALE MARKET. THERE'S NO WAY TO EXCLUDE OTHER WREAKED OTHER WESTERN STATES FROM PARTICIPATING ONCE THE DOOR IS OPEN YOU CAN'T SIMPLY ALLOW THE STATE'S YOU LIKE TO JOIN. EVERYBODY GETS TO JOIN ON EQUAL TERMS SO IN OUR VIEW THERE IS A HUGE RISK HERE THAT EXPANSION PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY. FOR OTHER HOSTILE PARTIES IN THE WEST TO COME AFTER CALIFORNIA'S POLICIES AND IT INVITES ADDITIONAL SCRUTINY BY THE FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION. LAST FRIDAY THE ENTER THE BURKE ISSUED A DECISION RELATED TO. ISO NEW ENGLAND. AND THAT'S FILLED WITH WARNING SIGNS THAT THIS BURKE IS NOT LIKE THE FORK THE CAME BEFORE IT. AND THAT THERE MAYBE NEW LIMITS OR ATTEMPTS TO CREATE LIMITS ON NEW STATE CLEAN ENERGY POLICIES THAT FRUSTRATE REGIONAL MARKET DESIGN. GIVEN THE RISK WHY DON'T WE SLOW DOWN AND TRY ALTERNATIVES TO EXPANDING THE I SO WHILE WE FURTHER UNDERSTAND WHAT THE RISKS MIGHT LOOK LIKE AS LITIGATION PROCEEDS AND OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY. OUR CONCERN ABOUT AB EIGHT THIRTEEN AS CURRENTLY DRAFTED IS IT REALLY CONTAINS VERY FEW ENFORCEABLE MEANINGFUL AND DURABLE PROTECTIONS. ON THE OBLIGATIONS THAT ARE IDENTIFIED FOR INCLUSION IN THE AYE ESOS NEW GOVERNING DOCUMENTS. ARE VAGUE SUBJECT A SUBSTANTIAL INTERPRETATION AND PRETTY MUCH INADEQUATE TO ADDRESS THE LEGITIMATE CONCERNS ABOUT THE THREAT TO CALIFORNIA'S INTERESTS. AND IN FACT THE PROVISIONS IN THE BILL ARE SUBSTANTIALLY WEAKER THAN THOSE THAT WERE INCLUDED IN DRAFTS THAT WERE CIRCULATED BY THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE JUST SEVERAL YEARS AGO SO IT APPEARS THAT IT'S GOING IN THE WRONG DIRECTION FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE. AND I'D ALSO LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT ANY GUARANTEES THAT CALIFORNIA MIGHT RECEIVE AS PART OF AN INITIAL DEAL. CAN LATER BE REVOKED AND THIS HAS HAPPENED IN OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY WERE STATES HAVE ENTERED INTO AGREEMENTS AS PART OF OUR T. O. MARKET MECHANISMS. AND LATER ON THOSE DEALS HAVE BEEN UNWOUND AFTER THE STATE HAD ALREADY PROVIDED IT'S BINDING AGREEMENT IN FACT THAT'S THE BASIS FOR THE HUGE RETAILING CASE THAT THE SUPREME COURT DECIDED TWO YEARS AGO. I'M. IN TERMS OF THE BENEFITS OF REGIONAL EXPANSION ON THE RESULTS ARE QUITE NEXT IN THE EYES OF STUDIES THAT BE THREE FIFTY STUDIES THAT WERE COMPLETED TWO YEARS AGO. AND THE RESULTS ACTUALLY CAN SHOW SLIGHT INCREASES IN YOUR TERM GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. AND HIGHER GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND GAS POWER PLANT DISPATCH WITH IN CALIFORNIA. THIS KIND CUTS AGAINST THE IDEA HERE THAT REGIONALIZATION REDUCES THE POLLUTION IMPACT ON LOW INCOME AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES IN THE STATE. ARMED THE MODELING ACTUALLY SHOWS THAT THERE CAN BE AN INCREASE IN GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AN INCREASE IN GAS DISPATCH WITH IN CALIFORNIA. AND. SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE CONCERNS WE HAVE ALSO. NOT THE CURTAILMENT SITUATION I THINK WE APPRECIATE THE CHALLENGE OF THE SITUATION THAT'S IN FRONT OF US TODAY. I'M WITH. EXCEEDINGLY LARGE AMOUNTS OF INTERMITTENT RENEWABLE POWER CREATING OPERATIONAL CHALLENGES. BUT THE EYES SO ON TODAY JUST IDENTIFIED EIGHT DIFFERENT TOOLS THAT COULD BE AVAILABLE TO TRY TO MANAGE SOME OF THOSE RISKS ONLY ONE OF THEM INVOLVE REGIONAL EXPANSION. AND THEIR OWN STUDY. ACTUALLY FOUND THAT MOST OF THE REDUCTIONS IN CURTAILMENT IN TWENTY THIRTY. CAN BE ACHIEVED WITHOUT. ROBERT WITHOUT REQUIRING THE ISO TO BECOME A REGIONAL GRID OPERATOR SPECIFICALLY THEIR STUDY FOUND THAT SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE REDUCTIONS IN CURTAILMENT. COULD BE REALIZED SIMPLY THROUGH ENHANCED BILATERAL COORDINATION THROUGHOUT THE WEST WITHOUT NEEDING TO EXPAND THE ISO. WE THINK SO SO WHAT CAN THE STATE DO. I'M TO CAPTURE SOME OF THESE BENEFITS WITHOUT STEPPING INTO A RISKY ENVIRONMENT. IN OUR VIEW THE ALTERNATIVES INCLUDE WORKING WITH OTHER IN STATE BALANCING AUTHORITIES. OWNED BY PUBLICLY OWNED UTILITIES TO IN TO INCREASE COORDINATION. AND MAYBE EVEN NEGOTIATE TERMS FOR JOINING THE ISO. NO GOVERNANCE CHANGES WOULD BE NEEDED. TO EXPAND THE ISO WITHIN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND THEN THERE'S EXPANDING THE VOLUNTARY ENERGY IMBALANCE MARKET WHICH WAS DISCUSSED A FEW MINUTES AGO. TO PERMIT A GREATER RELIANCE ON TRANSACTIONS WITH OTHER WESTERN BALANCING AUTHORITIES THAT GO BEYOND THE REAL TIME MARKET. ON THE I SO IS CERTAINLY LOOKING INTO THIS AND WE THINK IT'S FERTILE GROUND. HOW COORDINATION WITH THE BONNEVILLE POWER AUTHORITY? BONNEVILLE POWER AUTHORITY CONTROLS A LARGE SET OF HYDRO ASSETS TRYING TO USE THOSE ASSETS MORE EFFECTIVELY. TO COORDINATE WITH CALIFORNIA'S NEEDS COULD BE A WIN WIN. AND THEN FINALLY WORKING WITH OTHER WESTERN BALANCING AUTHORITIES TO REDUCE BARRIERS TO EXPORTING ACCESS POWER THAT'S PRODUCED IN CALIFORNIA. SO. THAT'S WHERE WE'RE COMING FROM ON THIS WE CERTAINLY LOOK FOR TO WORKING WITH OTHER PARTIES AND SUBSTANTIVELY ENGAGING BUT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE ARE AWARE THAT THIS IS NOT A RISK FREE PROPOSITION. AND WE'RE NOT SURE WHAT BINDING PROTECTIONS CAN BE INCLUDED IN STATE LAW THAT ARE GOING TO GIVE US THE COMFORT. THAT OUR POLICIES ARE NOT GONNA BE IN THE CROSS HAIRS UNDER AN EXPANDED GREAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ARMSTRONG. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. BEFORE I GO INTO WORD SOME OF THE PREPARE MARKS THAT I IT DID. A THOUGHT ABOUT AND DISCUSSING TODAY I WANTED TO ESSENCE I HAVE MISTER ROUGHLY OR SLIDE STILL IN FRONT OF ME ANYWAY. A AND THAT'S THE FIRST TIME I'VE SEEN HIM. THINK ABOUT SAYS SOME OF THE THINGS THAT THE THEY CLEARLY ARTICULATE AND AND ONE OF THEM IS. THE YOU SEE THERE SAID AS YOU CAN SEE THE ROLE OF THE GHASTLY IN TODAY'S OPERATION IT'S VERY VERY SICK. IT'S SIGNIFICANT ON THE PEAK DAY SLIDE THAT MISTER ROCK LEADER A. A SET FORTH AND IT'S SIGNIFICANT AND RAMPING SLIDES. THAT HE SET FORTH TO MEET THE RELIABLE OPERATION OF THE SYSTEM SO. JUST SOMETHING THAT WE NEED THINK ABOUT. AND WE KNOW IT'S A SUBJECTIVE OTHER DISCUSSIONS OTHER LEGISLATION. IT'S BIG IT'S BIG DEAL IT'S WHAT WE RELY ON TODAY IN MANY MANY INSTANCES OF RIVAL SYSTEM OPERATION. AND THE OTHER THING IS AND IT STRIKES ME IS THAT TO HIS JOBS VERY HARD. AND WE SHOULDN'T TAKE IT FOR GRANTED. AND THAT IT'S GETTING MORE CHALLENGING. HE'S CONFIDENT AND I THINK WE ALL ARE SINCE WE'VE MET THE CHALLENGES ALREADY THAT WE WILL NEED IN THE FUTURE. BUT WE SHOULDN'T MAKE POLICY DECISIONS THAT MAKETHE JOB MORE DIFFICULT SO I THINK WE NEED TO KEEP THAT IN MIND AS WE MOVE FORWARD AS WELL. SO S. SEE ANYWAY ISN'T A DIVERSE ORGANIZATION A PUBLIC POWER ENTITIES DATA. ON ELECTRIC SIDE IT'S ABOUT FORTY FORTY THREE FORTY FOUR SOMEONE THAT RANGE OF ELECTRIC UTILITIES. I AND THERE'S MANY POSITIONS WITHIN THAT LARGE GROUP ON REGIONALIZATION SOME ARE STRONGLY OPPOSED. SOME ARE GENERALLY SUPPORTIVE. AND YOU MAY LIKELY HEAR SOME OF THOSE COMMENTS TODAY. AS A WHOLE. I THINK WE ARE. LOOKING NOT TOWARDS THE IDEA OR CONCEPT OF REGIONAL EXPANSION OF THE I SO. BUT THE PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS AND WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR OUR CUSTOMERS. HOW DOES IT AFFECT RATES HOW DOES IT AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO KEEP THE LIGHTS ON HOW DOES THAT AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO MAKE MEET THAT OUR POLICY OBJECTIVES? OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND ONE OF THINGS A THE MAIN POINT I'D LIKE TO COMMUNICATE AND TO THE COMMITTEE TODAY IS THAT. I THINK THERE IT SOMETIMES CONFLATED NO STATUTORY. CHANGES WITH NOTHING IS HAPPENING IN IT INDUSTRY AND IN FACT NOTHING COULD BE FARTHER IN THE CHURCH THAN THE TRUTH. THE I. SO SHOULD BE APPLAUDED BY FOR ITS INNOVATIVE ENERGY IMBALANCE MARKET AND I DON'T THINK ANYONE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT. THAT IN A FEW SHORT YEARS YOU WOULD HAVE HAD. ELEVEN ENTITIES A. EITHER ALREADY PART OF THE OPERATIONAL  <u><c.green>IBM. OR</c></u> LOOKING TO BE PART OF THAT OPERATION BY TWENTY TWENTY. ON THAT IS AND A TREMENDOUS ACCOMPLISHMENT IT'S AN ON PARALLELED A AMOUNT OF REGIONAL COLLABORATION. IDIOT AND IT'S NOT JUST POLICY DECISIONS BY EXECUTIVES BUT ALL THE SOFTWARE AND TECHNOLOGY AND CHANGES TO SYSTEMS THAT GO IN PLACE. TO ALIGN THE OPERATION OF THE ENTITIES ITS IT IS A VERY BIG LEFT. AND SO THAT SHOULD BE NOT GO UNNOTICED. WHICH IS ALSO NOT GO UNNOTICED IS THAT. YOU HAVE UP FOR PUBLIC POWER ENTITIES FOR OF THE LARGEST EIGHT PUBLIC POWER ENTITIES IN THE UNITED STATES. THAT ARE ON TRACK TO BECOME E. I AM ENTITIES WHERE WE'RE SITTING RIGHT NOW THE SACRAMENTO MUNICIPAL UTILITY DISTRICT. PART OF THE BALANCING OF THE WORRY OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WILL BECOME IS SET TO BECOME ANY ID AND AN ENTITY. ARE APPROXIMATELY THIS TIME NEXT YEAR. HOT LOSANGELES DEPARTMENT OF WATER AND POWER NOT SALT RIVER PROJECT WHICH IS THE PHOENIX AREA WHICH IS. BASICALLY THE SAME SIZE AS DEPARTMENT WATER POWER. AND THE CITY OF SEATTLE ARE ALL SET TO GO WHEN IN A TWENTY TWENTY OTHER CURRENT SCHEDULE. SO THAT IS A BIG PARADIGM SHIFT AND I SAY THAT BECAUSE AS A. PUP AS A MARKET SEGMENT PUBLIC POWER IS PROBABLY THE MOST CYNICAL AND. AND I SAW SKEPTICAL AND CAUTIOUS. IT COMES TO A THE DEVELOPMENT OF THESE REGION MARKET SO YOU SEEN A CHANGE. AND IF THE CHANGES DRIVEN BY THE CHANGING ENVIRONMENTS AND THE OPERATIONAL CHALLENGES THAT THOSE AT DIS. ARE ALL FACING PERHAPS NOT TO THE SAME EXTENT THAT THE ISO WAS FIXING BECAUSE OF THE AGGRESSIVE POLICIES. THAT WE PUT IN PLACE BUT IN ONE WAY SHAPE OR FORM SO THAT'S. IT'S A HARBINGER OF THE CHANGING ENVIRONMENT NOT JUST HERE BUT ELSEWHERE IN THE WEST. THE I. AS IT WAS ALSO. MAKING CHANGES TO ITS MARKET TO BETTER INTEGRATE. RENEWABLES AND THEN PROPOSING TO EXTEND THOSE CHANGES INTO THEIR DAY AHEAD MARKET AND EXPAND THAT TO THE ENTIRE E. I AM FOOTPRINT. THIS IS GOING TO INVOKE A HOST OF DIFFICULT POLICY AND CHOICES. CITY STATE ASSOCIATED WITH MAKING SURE THAT RESOURCE ADEQUACY IS MAINTAINED. A WHETHER THERE ARE GOVERNMENTS CHANGES THAT ARE NECESSARY HOW TRANSMISSION COSTS WILL BE ALLOCATED. I'M BUT A IT IT APPEARS TO BE WELL ON ITS WAY IT APPEARS TO BE HAPPENING. AND AT THAT POINT IN TIME THE VOLUMES THAT ARCHIE EXCHANGED AND TREATED THROUGH THE I SO CENTRALIZED MARKET WILL GO UP BY LEAPS AND BOUNDS OVER WHAT IS. CURRENTLY DONE IN THE E. I. M. ALL THIS IS GOING TO HAPPEN. ON OR IS SET TO BE PROPOSED AND IT IN MY OPINION IS LIKELY TO HAPPEN. WITHOUT STATUTORY A. SO THE LAST DEVELOPMENT THAT'S HAPPENING IS. ON THE I SO IS HOLDING ITSELF OUT AS A PROVIDER OF RELIABILITY SERVICES OR RELIABILITY COORDINATOR SERVICES SPECIFICALLY. AND. MANY THINGS CAN CHANGE BUT I WOULD SAY THAT. IT'S LIKELY THAT SIXTY FIVE OR SEVENTY PERCENT OF THE DEMAND IN THE WESTERN UNITED STATES WILL TAKE RELIABILITY COORDINATOR SERVICES FROM NASA. SO NO ONE WOULD OF THOUGHT IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN ONLY WENT DOWN THIS A PATH OF ENERGY IMBALANCE MARKET THAT ANY OF THIS THAT THIS KIND OF PROGRESS WHAT HAPPENS IS. I SOMEONE ON A COLD A THAT WAS ON YESTERDAY SAID THAT THE WESTERN UNITED STATES ITS NEVER MOVED. THIS QUICKLY A ASIT RELATES TO CHANGES IN THE INDUSTRY I WILL SAY THAT THAT'S PERHAPS A LOW BAR. AND BECAUSE WE HAVE A CHIP MOVED VERY QUICKLY OFTEN. BUT THE EH BITE. IRRESPECTIVE OF STATUTORY CHANGE. INDUSTRY ITSELF IS EVOLVING TO TACKLE THE CHALLENGES THAT MISTER RUFF LEADER HAS HAS LAID OUT. SO IN TWENTY TWENTY. WERE GONNA HAVE AN E. I. M.. THAT IS LIKELY TO BE WELL OVER HALF OF THE LOAD IN THE WESTERN UNITED STATES. WE COULD HAVE BY THEN AN EXTENSION THAT EXPANSION OF THEY HAD MARKET FUNCTIONALITY TO BETTER OPTIMIZE THE COMMITMENT OF RESOURCES IN A FORWARD TIME PERIOD. THAT. IS THAT SCENE  <u><c.green>I AM</c></u> FOOTPRINT OR PERHAPS EVEN A SLIGHTLY BEYOND. WELL HAVE WE COULD VERY WELL HAVE SEVENTY PERCENT OF THE WEST TAKING RELIABILITY SERVICES FROM THE I SO. THIS IS GOING TO HAPPEN. IN MY OPINION WITH OR WITHOUT. GEORGE. SO WORST WE'RE TAKING A LOOK AT THE I ESOS GOVERNANCE. SORT OF IN THAT CONTEXT OF THE EVOLUTION OF THE INDUSTRY AS A WHOLE. SOME OF THE THINGS THAT HAVE COME UP. I BELIEVE I AGREE WITH MR FRIEDMAN THIS IS A ONE WAY TICKET AND SO THAT HEIGHTENS THE IMPORTANCE. OF THE CHURCH OF THE DECISIONS THAT WERE MAKING. CHANGES THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE AND PUT IN PLACE TO. EXTRICATE A LARGE UTILITY FROM A CENTRALIZED MARKET AND THE LITIGATION THAT WOULD ENSUE. ART ARE NOT TRIVIAL. I DON'T AGREE WITH MISTER FREEMAN THAT STATES WILL BE BIT PLAYERS STATES ARE NEVER BIT PLAYERS. OUT WHILE THE LANGUAGE IN THE BILL RIGHT NOW IS NOT A SPECIFIC AS THE WHITE PAPERS THAT WERE PUT OUT IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN. MY I ALWAYS VIEWED THAT AS JUST DETAIL TO FALL. STATES ARE NEVER BIT PLAYERS IN OTHER ORGANIZED MARKETS STATES HAVE MEANINGFUL ROLES PARTICULARLY ON ISSUES LIKE TRANSMISSION OST ALLOCATION. AND. PROCUREMENT ISSUES THAT CUT ACROSS. I STATE JURISDICTION. SO. WE NEED THINK HARD ABOUT THE IMPACTS OF THOSE IN CALIFORNIA. THINK THERE ARE SOLUTIONS OUT THERE. ON. FINALLY AND. A MISTER FRIEDMAN AND DISCUSS THE OPTION OF HAVING CALIFORNIA. PUBLIC POWER BALANCING AUTHORITIES JOIN THE ISO AS A MENTIONED YOU HAVE. BANK EN LA THE TWO LARGEST PUBLIC POWER BOUNCING AUTHORITIES IN CALIFORNIA. BY A LARGE MARGIN. ALREADY SET TO BECOME E. I AMENITIES BUT BEYOND THAT. NEVER BEEN AN ISSUE OF. A PHILOSOPHICAL OBJECTION. IT'S BEEN IN ISSUE OF. WHERE THE DOLLARS AND CENTS AND THE IMPACTS ON LOCAL DECISION MAKING? AND SO THOSE DOES. COST BENEFIT ANALYSES ARE ALWAYS ON GOING. AND WHEN. WE LOOK AT A IT IN TERMS OF. SHOULD WE JOIN THE AYSO WHICH A PTO DESPAIN TRANSMISSION ARE IT'S WELL THAT DO LOWER RATES WHAT WILL THAT DO TO OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN AND. A DECISION MAKING OVER OUR RESOURCES. THAT'S THE BALANCING ITS NOT TO SO I DON'T I DON'T KNOW WHAT THERE IS BEYOND BACK THAT WOULD NEED TO. TAKE PLACE THAT WOULD A MOVE IN THE DIRECTION THAT MISTER FRIEDMAN SUGGEST. SO BATS A GENERALLY WHAT HAD FOR YOU TODAY THERE'S A LOT GOING ON HARDLY THE INDUSTRY CAN HARDLY KEEP UP. R. THAT'S GOING THAT PACE OF CHANGE IS GOING TO HAPPEN IRRESPECTIVE OF WHAT HAPPENS IN THE LEGISLATURE THIS YEAR. AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU ON HOWEVER THAT JUST GOVERNMENT'S DISCUSSION FOR THE ISA CONTINUES. WELL THANK YOU I APPRECIATE ALL OF YOU AND YOUR PRESENTATIONS AND CERTAINLY. YOU KNOW WILL BE THE FIRST TO SAY WE FEEL. OF THE CHANGE REFILL HOW RAPIDLY THINGS ARE HAPPENING IN THE MARKETPLACE BECAUSE IT FINDS ITS WAY TO THIS COMMITTEE IN ONE FORM OR ANOTHER. AND SO WE'RE TRYING TO RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF WHAT THE CONCEPT OF RACIALIZATION COULD MEAN IN TERMS OF OUR FUTURE. AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAD A PROCESS ONE THAT WAS TRANSPARENT ONE THAT WAS DELIBERATE ONE THAT ALLOWED FOR. THE SHARING OF A VARIETY OF IDEAS AND AS YOU CAN HEAR JUST IN THIS PANEL ALONG HERE ARE. DIFFERENT POINTS OF VIEWS ON WHAT. A REALIZE MARKET MAY MEAN. TO THE FUTURE OF THE RATE PAYERS IN CALIFORNIA SO WE DO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE DOING THE RIGHT THING IN MOVING AT THE RIGHT SPEED AND TAKING THE RIGHT INFORMATION AND. I DID WANNA AND I'LL TURN TO OTHER MEMBERS BY DO WANT TO ASK A QUESTION REALLY TO. TO GET. MISS WHISTLING YOUR. HE RESPONSE. TO MISTER MISTER FRIEDMAN'S. SUGGESTION ABOUT THE POLICIES AND. CONFLICTING POLICIES I THOUGHT IN YOUR PRESENTATION WAS. A. A REFERENCE TO. I ESPECIALLY AS YOU LOOK AT. ENERGY THAT'S COMING IN FROM OTHER STATES HOW THAT'S GOING TO BE PRICED AND WHAT THE IMPACT COULD BE TO OUR POLICIES IN. TERMS OF A THE RENEWABLE STRATEGIES THAT WE'VE ALREADY PUT IN PLACE AND HOW REGIONALIZATION CREATES A DIFFERENT KIND OF OPPORTUNITY AND NO IN THE BILL WE HAVE REQUIREMENTS FOR GHG TRACKING. CANOE KIND OF THE LOOT. EXPAND ON THAT A LITTLE BIT IN TERMS OF. POLICIES AND POTENTIAL CONFLICTS THAT. WELL I. SHIRT LET ME. ONE THING THAT COMES TO MIND SO. MATT DID MENTION THAT HE HE FEELS THAT THE OUR PS WOULD BE IN JEOPARDY IF WE WERE TO MOVE TO A WESTERN REGIONAL ENERGY MARKET AND SO. I SIMPLY TALKING ABOUT IS THAT THE WAY THE RPF THE STRUCTURED RIGHT NOW THERE. THERE'S AN EMPHASIS ON PURCHASING ELECTRICITY THAT IS EITHER LOCATED INSIDE THE STATE OF ARE ACTUALLY SORRY NOT ONLY LOCATED INSIDE CALIFORNIA BECAUSE THAT WOULD VIOLATE THE COMMERCE CLAUSE. BUT IS DIRECTLY INTERCONNECTED TO THE CAL I SO OR IF IT'S NOT I CAN BE. CAN BE TRANSMITTED IN ON AN HOURLY BASIS AND COUNTED AS SUCH AND IF WE WERE TO EXPAND TO A WESTERN AYE SO. THEN ANYTHING THAT'S DIRECTLY INTERCONNECTED INTO THE WESTERN AYE SO NOT JUST THE CAL I SO WOULD BE CONSIDERED BUCKET ONE AND SO. IN EFFECT IT WOULD PUT LESS OF AN EMPHASIS ON THE REMAINING PROCUREMENT WE NEED TO DO UNDER THE CURRENT OUR PS REQUIREMENT. TO BUILD PROJECTS IN STATES. AND I DON'T DENY THAT THAT'S A RISK BUT I GUESS THE THING THAT I THINK ABOUT IS NUMBER ONE. A LOT OF PROCUREMENT HAS ALREADY HAPPENED TO ME THAT FIFTY PERCENT AND IT'S ALREADY LOCKED DAN. THE BULK OF REMAINING PROCUREMENT THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN. I THINK IS TO BE DONE BY THE CCA'S THE COMMUNITY CHOICE AGGREGATORS THE CCA'S HAVE BEEN VERY. OUTSPOKEN AND AND IN FACT THERE'S A LOT OF PUBLIC PRESSURE ON THEM TO DO AS MUCH IN STATE DEVELOPMENT AS POSSIBLE OBVIOUSLY THEY'RE DOING OTHER THINGS TO. KEEP THEIR OPTIONS OPEN BUT I DO THINK THAT THERE ARE OTHER OPPORTUNITIES TO PUT A THUMB ON THE SCALE FOR IN STATE DEVELOPMENT EVEN IF IT'S NOT. THE RP ES THAT'S DOING THAT. I ALSO THINK THAT WE'VE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE OUR PS IS BECOMING LESS AND LESS OF THE TOOL WE'RE GONNA USE TO DRIVE RENEWABLE PROCUREMENT IN THE FUTURE SO. MY PERSONAL OPINION IS THAT IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO DO AN EIGHTY PERCENT ARE PS FOR EVERY UTILITY. LOAD SERVING ENTITY IN THE STATE WE ARE GONNA HAVE TO MOVE TO SOMETHING THAT'S A LITTLE BIT MORE FLEXIBLE. RECOGNIZING THE NEED TO BE MORE FLEXIBLE TO ACCOMMODATE ALL THESE RENEWABLES AND SO I THINK THAT. IT'S BEEN IT THE WAY WE STRUCTURE THE OUR PS HAS BEEN A REALLY IMPORTANT AND EFFECTIVE WAY TO DRIVE IN STATE DEVELOPMENT THAT. IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO HAPPEN NO MATTER WHAT. AND IN MY MIND THE BENEFITS OF A REGIONAL GRADE TO. BRINGING RENEWABLES ONLINE FASTER MORE COST EFFECTIVELY. OUT WAYS. THE CONCERNS THAT WE'RE NOT GONNA GET QUITE AS MUCH IN STATE DEVELOPMENT AS WE WOULD OTHERWISE. S. PURSUIT. I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR. ANY OF THE OTHER PANELISTS RESPOND TO MISTER FRIEDMAN SIR. STERN ABOUT. HOW THE WESTERN REGIONALIZATION WOULD? STRENGTHEN THE CASE FOR FEDERAL PREEMPTION. IT WOULD SEEM TO ME THAT. ANY. REFORM THAT THAT. TAKE THIS FURTHER IN THE DIRECTION. AWAY FROM CALIFORNIA GOVERNMENTS TO ENTER STATE GOVERNMENTS. IS GOING TO ONLY STRENGTHEN. A CASE FOR FEDERAL PREEMPTION AND FEDERAL AN INTERVENTION. WHICH YOU KNOW I HAVE AS WE'VE SEEN THE LAST TWO WEEKS. WELL WE HAVE A HOSTILE ADMINISTRATION. TO CALIFORNIA'S POLICIES. HOW THAT WOULD NOT? OPEN UP THE DOOR TO THE POTENTIAL FOR. THE COMPLETE GUTTING OF ALL OF OUR. GREENHOUSE GAS AND. POLLUTION EFFORTS THAT WERE SURPRISED AT HEARING IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IF IT'S POSSIBLE TO DO THAT. IT'S POSSIBLE FOR THEM TO DO THAT NOW. NOTHING CHANGES THE FACT THAT THE GUY CALIFORNIA'S. POLICIES ARE SUBJECT TO A COMP ARE SUBJECT TO COMMERCE CLAUSE AND THAT'S BEEN THE CASE SINCE SEPTEMBER NINE EIGHTEEN FIFTY WHEN WE JOINED THE UNION THAT THE COMMERCE CLAUSE SUPPLIES SO. IF OUR POLICIES CONFLICT WITH THE COMMERCE CLAUSE AND SO WE CAN MAKE AN ARGUMENT THAT. YOU KNOW THAT'S THE CASE. THEN THAT'S A PROBLEM BUT THAT'S A PROBLEM TODAY SURE I WHETHER WE'VE D. WHETHER ALASKA JOINS US OR WHETHER NEVADA JOINS US IT'S STILL A PROBLEM. TODAY LIKEWISE UNDER THE FEDERAL POWER ACT. WE ARE SUBJECT TO. TODAY. WITH THE SINGLE. WITH A SINGLE STATE AYE SO AYE AND WE WERE SUBJECT TO THE FEDERAL POWER ACT PRIOR TO PRIOR TO THE EYES OF I WAS ON THE LOSING END OF LITIGATION. AND NINETEEN NINETY FIVE ON THAT ISSUE. IT IF YOU'RE IF YOU IF YOU'RE A DOT CONSISTENT WITH THE FEDERAL POWER ACT YOU'RE YOU'RE EXPOSED AS WELL. MISTER. FRIEDMAN RAISED A HUGE CASE WHICH WAS A MARYLAND CASE AND THE SUPREME COURT WENT OUT OF THEIR WAY IN THAT CASE TO SAY WAS VERY NARROW WHAT THEY WERE WHAT WOULD THEY WERE FOCUSED ON WHICH WAS BASICALLY. A THE FACT THAT THAT THAT THESE WERE NOT BILATERAL CONTRACTS. THERE WOULD NORMALLY BE. RECOGNIZE BETWEEN TWO PARTIES BUT THAT THIS STATE TRIED TO TIED THEIR POLICY TO SOMETHING THAT. TO TO A FORK RATE AND THAT'S THAT'S THE ONE THING THAT SET OFF A THAT PROBLEM WE HAVE HUNDREDS IF NOT THE A WITH HUNDREDS OF CONTRACTS. THAT ARE HONORED WITH RESPECT TO RENEWABLE CONTRACTS WITH GREAT RESPECT GAS CONTRACTS. RESPECTED ALL KINDS OF THINGS THAT ARE DIRE NOT IMPACTED BY THAT SO I DON'T SEE THAT THERE'S ANY RISK ADDITIONAL RISK THAT OF HAVING THE MULTISTATE BODY. OR MULTI JURISDICTIONAL BODY. THEN WE ARE ALREADY FACE I THINK THAT'S AT THE HEART OF THE DISPUTED THAT THE TWO OF US ARE HAVING. BUT I JUST DON'T SEE IT. I I JUST WELL I I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND MEN UNDERSTAND THAT ANYTHING THE SUBJECT TO LITIGATION JUST AS WE'VE SEEN. WITH OUR A. YOU KNOW. SANCTUARY STATE LAWS BEING CHALLENGED BY THE NEW UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT JUSTICE BUT IT SEEMS LIKE ANY DIRECTION. BY AND A ANY MOVEMENT TOWARD A MULTI STATE. GOVERNING STRUCTURE WHICH ONLY. MAKE THE FEDERAL CASE STRONGER FOR PREMIUMS. IT'S HARDY PRODUCED. DID EXTENT IT'S IT'S A STRONG CASE UNDER UP LET'S USE THE FEDERAL POWER ACT. IT'S GOING TO BE A STRONG CASE THAT AS I SAID REGARDLESS OF WHETHER NEVADA'S IN IT OR NOT. OKAY IF IT'S VIOLATING THE FEDERAL OF FEDERAL POWER ACT THAT'S GOING TO BE A PROBLEM. AND. AYE AYE THOUGH IF YOU WOULD WOULD YOU. WHEN IT WHEN I'M LOOKING AT THE OTHER CASES THAT OF POPPED UP NATIONALLY AYE THE DEITIES NORMALLY DON'T HINGE ON WHETHER OR NOT. IT IT IT'S MULTI STATE OR NOT TURNS OUT THAT WHERE WE AND NEW YORK ARE THE ONLY TWO SINGLE STATE ARTIOS. SO THERE THERE IT IS THERE IS AN IMPACT THERE'S SAID TO FAIRLY SMALL COMMUNITY OF A OF ENTITIES BUT I'M NOT SURE IF THERE'S A. DISTINCTION BETWEEN MULTI STATE. YOU KNOW POWER TRANSMISSION OR OUR POWER PROCUREMENT. VERSES MULTI STATE GOVERNMENTS. AND AND IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT AND CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG MISTER FRIEDMAN BUT MY IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT. THIS EFFORT IS. SEEKING TO TAKE THE GOVERNMENT AND GOVERNMENTS FROM AS YOU INDICATED. THE APPOINTMENTS. BY OUR GOVERNOR AND OUR STATE SENATE. TO A MULTI STATE GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE. IF I MAY ASSEMBLY MEMBER ON IT ACTUALLY IS IN A MULTI STATE GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE IT IS NOT TETHERED TO ANY STATE GOVERNMENT. UNDER THE PROPOSAL IT WOULD BE A. PURELY INDEPENDENT BOARD AND FOR QUIT HAVE SOLDIERS DICTION OVERSIGHT WORSE TODAY WE HAVE A SYSTEM WHERE FOR DOES HAVE OVERSIGHT JURISDICTION OVER THE CALIFORNIA AYE SO. BUT THE ISO WAS ALSO RESPONSIBLE TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. ON I WANT TO. AGREE WITH YOUR CONCERN OBVIOUSLY SINCE I RAISE THAT I AGREE WITH THAT. THERE HAVE BEEN CASES FOR EXAMPLE THE STATE OF MINNESOTA ENACTED A LAW THAT PROHIBITED THE IMPORT OF COAL FIRED ELECTRICITY INTO THE STATE MINNESOTA IS PART OF THE MIDWEST INDEPENDENT SYSTEM OPERATOR. SOME COOPERATIVES IN NORTH DAKOTA SUED THE STATE OF MINNESOTA AND THEY GOT A THREE OH NGUYEN IN THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT. NAM AND THE JUDGES IN THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT THAT RULED AGAINST THE STATE. WERE INFLUENCED BY THE FACT THAT MINNESOTA WAS PART OF A REGIONAL TRANSMISSION OPERATOR AND THAT THEIR POLICIES IMPERMISSIBLY INFRINGES UPON FORK JURISDICTIONAL WHOLESALE MARKET MECHANISMS AND RATES. I THINK WE ARE VERY LIKELY TO SEE SIMILAR CHALLENGES IN. A WESTERN RTO I CAN'T TELL YOU WHO'S GOING TO WIN AND WHO'S GONNA LOSE THAT'S KIND OF A ROLL OF THE DICE IN THE COURTS. ON BUT WE WILL HAVE MORE INTERESTED PLAYERS IN THE WEST SPECIALLY COLERIDGE STATES THAT ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE APPLICATION OF CALIFORNIA'S GREENHOUSE GAS POLICIES. IF IT TURNS OUT THAT ONE OF THEIR COAL FIRED PLANTS WITH TURNED ON DISTURB CALIFORNIA UNBEKNOWN TO THEIR KNOWLEDGE AND WE SEND THEM A BILL FOR THEIR GREENHOUSE GAS COSTS. WHAT'S THEIR REACTION LIKELY BE. DOWN THERE ARE GEARING UP TO SUE US AND I ALSO SEE A SITUATION WHERE THE CREATION OF AN RTO WAS GOING TO REQUIRE A LOT OF FOLK OVERSIGHT INVOLVEMENT IN APPROVAL OF TARIFFS. LOOK. THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAS DECLARED WAR AND. ON A NUMBER OF FRONTS I DON'T THINK WE I THINK IT WOULD BE NAIVE TO ASSUME. THAT IN THIS SITUATION THEY'RE GONNA TAKE A PASS ON USING SUCH AN OPPORTUNITY TO GO AFTER CALIFORNIA'S CLEAN ENERGY LEADERSHIP. IN FACT I IMAGINE ANY MEMBER OF THE FOR WORK WHO SUCCESSFULLY DOES THAT IS GOING TO GET A PROMOTION FROM THIS PRESIDENT. SO. THIS IS NOT YOUR PARENTS FOR. THEM WE ARE IN A BRAVE NEW WORLD AND I THINK CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO TAKE ALL MEASURES IT CAN'T PROTECT ITSELF. AGAINST OPPORTUNISTIC WEAPONIZATION OF FEDERAL JURISDICTION WHICH IS WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT AND REGIONAL LIVES IN THE I SO PUTS US AT DEEPER RISK ON THAT FRONT. ASSEMBLY MEMBER. THAT GUT FEELING AS HOLD UP JUST YET A SECOND I I WANT TO BE ABLE TO GIVE. OF THE MEMBERS OPPORTUNITY ASK QUESTIONS AND I AND I KNOW YOU GUYS ARE ALL IT'S IN THE RESPOND. OF SO I'M GONNA TURNTO DOCTOR QUIRK AND HE CAN RECOGNIZE YOU CAN MAKE A QUESTION OF. THAT PICKS UP ON THE LAST ONE AND GIVES USED ANYONE OF YOU AN OPPORTUNITY SPOT. ARM MODEL BE MORE OF A COMMENT FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU JUSTICE MACNEE JOHNSON THANK YOU JUSTICE. ARE FRIEDMAN. I WOULD JUST LIKE TO SAY WE'RE NOT GOING SETTLE FOR US THIS AFTERNOON. SO DON'T WORRY YOU'LL GET IT MORE OF A CHANCE TO MAKE YOUR ARGUMENT. I'M I WILL SAY THAT AT A. OUR CONFERENCE. THAT OF THE CALIFORNIA. FOREIGN YOU HAVE FOUND FOUNDATION FOR OUR. ENVIRONMENT IN THE ECONOMY HAD WE HEARD FROM ALISON CLEMENTS OF THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL. SHE IS DIRECTOR OF THE SUSTAINABLE FOR PROJECT AND FOR THOSE WHO BEEN HEARING FOR THAT'S THE FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION. AND ITS GROUP OF I THINK FIVE COMMISSIONERS WHO SET. OF VARIOUS POLICIES BASED UPON. THE LOS ARE SHE REFERRED TO THE MULTI STATE ARE SHE GAVE US A LECTURE ON THE MULTI STATE. OUR REGIONAL BALANCING THE. ORGANIZATIONS. ARM AND IT WAS HER JUDGMENT THAT THIS DID IN FACT HELP. OUR WITH THE ABSORPTION OF RENEWABLES. AGAIN WE'RE NOT GOING TO SETTLE THIS TODAY. I THINK THE IMPORTANT THING IS TO BE AWARE OF MISTER FRIEDMAN'S CONCERNS AND LOOK AT THEM CAREFULLY. I CERTAINLY MUCH RATHER JOINED A JUSTICE ARE SMUTTY JONES ARE. I ESTO THEN. JUSTICE FRIEDMAN SCIENCE SO. BUT. THE YOU KNOW YOU'VE RAISED GOOD QUESTIONS AND WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO RESOLVE THEM AND I WANT TO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND JUST SAY. I'M PREPARED TO LISTEN AND LEARN AND I KNOW THE CHAIR AND THE REST OF THIS YEAR ARE AS WELL THANK YOU. I HEARD IT MISS REYES ASKED ME TO MAKE A QUESTION BUT I ALSO ALIGN MY REMARKS OF MISTER QUIRK AND WAS ASKING CAN THINK ABOUT THAT THE GUY JUST ARM WRESTLE OFFER SOMETHIN EVERYTHING TO SEE. WHO WINS THEM YOU CERTAINLY THERE'S A DIVERSITY OF OPINION AS THERE SHOULD BE RIGHT AS THERE SHOULD BE ONE WE'RE LOOKING AN UNDERTAKING SOMETHING THIS OF THIS MAGNITUDE? WAS REYES ONE THINKS THIS MOVEMENT IN IN A LINE OF SMALL THINGS THAT I WAS ASKING BUT EARLIER. ARE THERE ARE THE RISKS THAT OTHER STATES COULD THEN SUBSIDIZE A DIRTY RESOURCES LIKE COAL. NAM LOWERING THE COST TO MAKE THEM MORE COMPETITIVE. OLD HABITS ARE HARD TO BREAK THAT WAS A QUESTION IT IS WOULD THERE BE THAT POTENTIAL OF OTHER STATES SUBSIDIZING IN ORDER TO REDUCE COSTS. MY TAKE A CRACK AT THIS M. SO. I THINK THE STATES HAVE ALL THE TOOLS THEY WOULD NORMALLY HAVE. LAND USE POLICY ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY TAX POLICY PROPERTY TAX POLICY. TO FURTHER THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT THAT THEY WANT. AND SO IS THAT A RISK. I THINK IT PROBABLY IS AND ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU LOOK AT SOME STATES AND THAT'S A HANDFUL WHERE COLE IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT PART OF THEIR. I WILL ALSO SAY AND I'M NOT AN EXPERT ON COAL DEVELOPMENT BUT MANY OF THE PUBLIC POWER ENTITIES IN THE WEST ARE HEAVILY HEAVILY. AND THEY SEE IT AS DYING IF NOT ALMOST AT. BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT YOUR LOT OF THE COAL PLANTS ARE COMING OFF CONTRACTS IN THE MID TWO THOUSANDS. AND YOU'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT A FEW MILLION DOLLARS HERE AND THERE. AND IT'S NOT JUST THE PLANTS IT'S THE MARKETS. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TENS AND TENS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF INVESTMENT. IN THE CONTEXT OF. OF KEEPING THESE RESOURCES IN INVESTING IN THEM TO BE READY DECADES LATER INTO THE FUTURE SO TO HAVE A CRYSTAL BALL. NO. ARE THEY LOOKING AT INVESTING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN THESE PLANTS TO KEEP THEM ALIVE NET. SO I AM. IT'S AN IMPORTANT ACTUALLY IMPORTANT THING ONE OF THE MANY VARIABLES THAT WE NEED THINK ABOUT. BUT I HADN'T SEEN A COMPELLING CASE THAT WE'RE GOING TO REINVIGORATE COLON ANY ANY SOONER. AND IN THE A SPIRITED DOCTOR QUIRKS COMMENTS AGAIN WE WILL HAVE OTHER CONVERSATIONS ON THIS BUT I WANTED TO. TURN TO THE PUBLIC AND SEE IF THEY'RE ANY. INDIVIDUALS WOULD LIKE TO TAKE NO MORE THAN THREE MINUTES. PRESENT THERE THOMAS. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS. ELEMENT HERE ON BEHALF SIERRA CLUB CALIFORNIA. TEN REPRESENTING FIVE HUNDRED. SO I FORTY FIFTY THOUSAND MEMBERS AND SUPPORTERS. I JOIN US UP BY SAYING I WE UNDERSTAND THERE THERE MAY BE MANY MANY BENEFITS TO REGIONAL GREAT ORIGINAL GOOD UNDER THE RIGHT CONDITIONS. HOWEVER WE HAVE SERIOUS CONCERNS ABOUT WHETHER THOSE RIGHT CONDITIONS WILL BE EFFECTIVELY ADDRESS. SPECIFICALLY BELIEVE THE INDIVIDUALIZATION ACTION MUST BE. GUARANTEES DO THE FOLLOWING WHICH IS AN EMPHASIS OF OF WHAT MAY HAVE AUDIT AND SAID. AND LET'S REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS THROUGHOUT THE REGION SIGNED UP FOR CALIFORNIA TO CONTINUE TO INVEST IN RENEWABLE ENERGY ON ITS OWN. ORIGINAL GREAT IS DESIGNED IN A WAY THAT WILL EXPAND OR EXTEND THE LIFE OF CULT PART IN NATURAL GAS POWER PLANTS. IT MUST BE I MESSAGES LOOK LIKE EVOLUTION IS NOT ACCEPTABLE FOR REGIONAL EFFORTS TO RESULT IN GREATER USE OF NATURAL GAS OR COAL PLANTS. THEREBY INCREASING GREAT AIR POLLUTION AYE ANYWHERE WITHIN THE STATE AT THE REGION. ESPECIALLY IN AND AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. IT MUST ENSURE ACCOUNTABILITY TO CONTINUE TO INNOVATE AND ACCELERATE IN TRANSITION AWAY FROM FOSSIL FUELS. ANY GOOD REASONS I SUPPOSE I MUST ALLOW CONTINUE TO. MISS A LOT CALIFORNIA'S CONTINUED USES LEADERSHIP ON CLIMATE CHANGE AND IT MUST MAINTAIN CONTROL THE TYPE OF ENERGY USED IN THE STATE. WE WERE THERE UNDER THE CONTROL OF THAT NEVER PREDICTABLE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION TO BE VERY DIFFICULT TO PROTECT HEALTH WHEN HIS INTEREST OF THE STATE BECOMES PART OF THE REGIONAL GREAT. AND LASTLY MUST ENSURE THAT THERE ARE CORRUPT AND USING ENERGY AND CLEAN ENERGY IN CALIFORNIA. WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT ANY REGIONAL GRID. PROPOSED DOES NOT RESULT IN A STAGNATION OF A GROWING. RENEWABLE AND CLEAN ENERGY JOB MARKET IN CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE MY. MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS SCOTT WHICH I'M HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA COALITION OF UTILITY EMPLOYEES. ALSO MY COLLEAGUES AS OUR D. AS. WAS NOT FEELING WELL. ROBBIE HUNTER S. B. REPRESENT THE STATE BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL. AS WELL AS MY OTHER BILLY TREATS CLIENTS THAT SEE ME HERE OFTEN AYE WE WANT TO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR WE THINK THAT AB EIGHT THIRTEEN. DOES PROVIDE. THE IMPETUS FOR A ROBUST DISCUSSION. AND AT THE END OF THE DAY OF THIS FOR AUGUST IN NOT. MARCH WE WOULD BE HERE SAY THAT WE NEED DEBT PROTECTIONS NOT PRINCIPLES. PARTICULARLY ON JOB SPEAKING TO YOU ASSEMBLYMAN EGGMAN. I WAS A LITTLE BIT TAKEN ABACK BY CAL ICE'S RESPONSE YOUR QUESTION THE VERY ELOQUENTLY SIDESTEPPED IT I THOUGHT. THEY BASICALLY THEIR RESPONSE TO YOU WAS THAT WELL IF WE REDUCE COSTS OVERALL TO THE WHOLE SYSTEM. THAT THAT THAT WILL RESULT IN JOB CREATION THAT'S THE TRICKLE DOWN ECONOMICS A APPROACH. WHAT THEY DIDN'T TELL YOU WAS THAT THEIR OWN STUDY FOUND THE S. B. THREE FIFTY STUDY WHICH THEY REFERENCE? FOUND THAT BETWEEN TWENTY THIRTY TWENTY TWENTY AND TWENTY THIRTY CALIFORNIA WOULD SEE A LOSS OF ONE HUNDRED AND TEN THOUSAND RENEWABLE ENERGY CONSTRUCTION JOBS. THAT HAS MY CLIENTS AND STATE BUILDING TRADES VERY VERY CONCERNED. WE WOULD LOSE THOSE JOBS UNDER THEIR STUDY IF WE DON'T PROTECT THE BUCKET SYSTEM. AND THE PROBLEM IS TO DATE NO LAWYER HAS COME UP WITH A SATISFACTORY. MECHANISM. TO. ENSURE THAT WE PROTECT THE BUCKETS. WELL ENTERED INTO A REGIONAL GRID WITHOUT. CREATING AND VERY EASY WORKAROUND. FOR FOLKS TO DELIVER IT AND UNCALLED BUCKET ONE. SO FIRST AND FOREMOST THAT ISSUE HAS TO BE RESOLVED CONCRETE LEAD ANY LEGISLATION SECONDLY. WE BELIEVE THERE HAVE TO BE CONCRETE PROTECTIONS ON. OUTLINING EXACTLY THE METHODOLOGY FOR HOW COST WILL BE ALLOCATED AND HEALTH BENEFITS WILL BE ASSESSED SIMPLY SAYING THAT A NEW TRANSMISSION LINE WILL MAKE IT EASIER TO IMPORT ENERGY TO CALIFORNIA IS A BENEFIT. ATTENTION HE PUTS US ON THE HOOK FOR PAYING EIGHTY PERCENT BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE REPRESENT AS FAR AS LOW TECH YOU YOU GOT THIRTY SEVEN EIGHTY PERCENT. OF THE LOAD. A WE WOULD BE ON THE HOOK FOR PAYING EIGHTY PERCENT THE COST OF TRANSMISSION PROJECTS OUTSIDE THE CITY CALIFORNIA LASTLY. GOVERNANCE HAS TO BE A OUTLINED VERY DIRECTLY AND WE THINK COULD BE IRRESPONSIBLE IF WHATEVER'S NEGOTIATED DIDN'T COME BACK TO THIS BODY FOR RATIFICATION THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR GIVING THE OPPORTUNITY BRIEFLY TO MAKE A COUPLE QUICK POINTS ARE NOT TO BE REDUNDANT MIKE MATIC COUNSEL FOR CONSUMER WATCHDOG. AND I AM OLD ENOUGH TO HAVE BEEN HERE DURING THE ORIGINAL. GOVERNMENT DEREGULATION OR ENERGY DEREGULATION WHEN THE. GOVERNOR PETE WILSON PUSH TO JIM BROUGHT HIS BILL. LATE IN THE NINETY SIX SESSION. THAT RESULTED IN THE FRIENDLY FIRE ACCIDENT CALIFORNIA GET ABOUT FORTY BILLION DOLLAR HIT. AND DOW ROLLING BLACKOUTS. GOVERNOR DAVIS THAT WAS RECALLED AND. ENRON EXECUTIVES. WENT TO JAIL FLED THE COUNTRY ABOVE. I CALIFORNIA SPENT YEARS OF REGAINING CONTROL OF ITS OWN POWER MARKET MANAGER BUT. NOW IF THERE IS THIS. AND ATTEMPT I BELIEVE TO TO A WE BELIEVE TO ATTEMPT TO OCCUR REINTRODUCE THIS A KIND OF A CONCEPT WHERE. WHAT HAS HAPPENING IS THAT? THIS. KIND OF A BAIT AND SWITCH THAT SAYS THAT WERE WE HAVE AN ISSUE WITH OUR OUR POWER EFFICIENCY HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND THAT SIMPLY ISN'T TRUE. WHAT THE PROPONENTS WANT IS TO MONETIZE AND RADICALLY EXPAND A NEW SPECULATIVE COMMODITIES MARKET? MUCH LIKE. LECTURE CITY BEING BOUGHT AND SOLD LIKE YOU WOULD FOR PORK BELLIES. THERE WILL BE NO WAY TO PREVENT AN OUT OF CONTROL PRICING SCHEME AS THERE WAS IN IN THE PAST. AND DIRTY COAL FIRED ENERGY IS GOING TO FIND ITS WAY INTO OUR STATE AT THE EXPENSE OF ALL CALIFORNIANS. I ONCE WE GIVE AWAY THE GOVERNOR'S IN THIS LEGISLATURE'S AUTHORITY. WE'RE NEVER GONNA GET BACK SO MISTER MURATSUCHI WAS CORRECT IN ASSUMING THAT THAT. THAT STATES ARE IN FACT A BIT PLAYERS IN THIS POTENTIAL SHAKESPEAREAN TRAGEDY BECAUSE PRE COURT HAS BEEN CLEAR. THAT THE REGIONAL ARTIOS AUTHORITY WILL IN FACT PREEMPT STATE LAW. THERE ARE SO IN IN CLOSING I JUST WOULD LIKE TO SAY BUT MAYBE IF WE ARE NOT MOVE ANYTHING THIS YEAR AND MAYBE LET THE NEXT GOVERNOR AND THIS LEGISLATURE. DETERMINED THAT THE SAFETY OF FUTURE CALIFORNIA'S THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME THANK. HI MY NAME'S TIM MCCRAE I'M THE VICE PRESIDENT FOR ENERGY FOR THE SILICON VALLEY LEADERSHIP GROUP. LEADERSHIP GROUP SUPPORTS REALIZATION OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPEND SYSTEM OPERATOR OR ISO. DONE RIGHT BIG TECH COMPANIES TO LOCAL SOLAR PANEL INSTALLERS TO SMALL FAMILY FARMS IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY WOULD BENEFIT FROM A FULLY INTEGRATED WESTERN GRADE. THE ISO ESTIMATES THAT LEGISLATION CREATE COMPARED TO NINETEEN THOUSAND JOBS IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE ELECTRICITY WILL BECOME MORE AFFORDABLE. CLEAN ENERGY PRODUCTION WOULD ALSO BENEFIT WE DO A LOT OF THAT. CURRENTLY CALIFORNIA SOMETIMES RUSSES MORE CLEAN ENERGY FROM RENEWABLE SOURCES THAT ARE GREAT CAN HANDLE FORCING CLEAN AFFORDABLE ENERGY TO BE THROWN AWAY AN INTEGRATED WESTERN GRIDLOCK CALIFORNIA CLEAN ENERGY TO REACH A BROADER REGIONAL MARKET. COULDN'T AGGRESSION WOULD ALSO HOPE ARE GOING CLEAN TECH SECTOR BY ALLOWING IN STATE WIND AND SOLAR PLANTS TO OPERATE AT FULL CAPACITY SO WE DON'T HAVE TO WASTE CLEAN ENERGY EVERY TIME SUPPLY EXCEEDS DEMAND. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. ANTONIO THEY ARE REPRESENTING THE IMPERIAL IRRIGATION DISTRICT OF AND WE ARE IN IN OPPOSITION TO THE EXISTING PROPOSAL ON REGIONALIZATION. THIS PROPOSAL CAN RESULT IN UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES AND WILL PUT IN SAY RENEWABLE RESOURCES. AGAINST IMPORTED ENERGY FROM OTHER STATES SOME OF IT AS YOU HEARD ALREADY A NON RENEWABLE. PROPONENTS OF THIS A PROPOSAL TELL YOU THAT MOVING FORWARD. YOU WILL BE ABLE TO EXPORT EXCESS POWER A INTO NEIGHBORING STATES BUT WHAT THEY HAVEN'T TOLD YOU IS THAT YOU ALSO EXPORT CALIFORNIA'S RENEWABLE ENERGY INDUSTRY. AND THE GOOD PAYING JOBS THAT COME WITH IT. EXPANDING THE ENERGY MARKET INTO A WESTERN AREA GRID CAN VERY WELL SEAT CALIFORNIA'S DECISION MAKING AUTHORITY TWENTY REGIONAL BOARD COMPRISED OF OTHER STATES. SOME OF WHICH DO NOT SHARE THE SAME CORE VALUES AND PRINCIPLES THAT WE DO HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THE CURRENT PROPOSAL WILL ALSO LEAVE THE SOLE AUTHORITY TO APPROVE THE UP FINAL GOVERNANCE PLAN IF THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO CALL IT. A AT THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION. THAT IS VERY DIFFERENT THAN WHAT YOU CURRENTLY HAVE. IN LAW TODAY. THROUGH S. B. THREE FIFTY WHICH GIVES YOU THE MEMBERS OF THIS BODY OF THAT FINAL AUTHORITY TO APPROVE SO. WE URGE THAT. THAT NOT CHANGE AND. HAVE THE FINAL VOTE IF ONE IS TO HAPPEN A BY THE MEMBERS OF OF THE LEGISLATURE. OUT AT THANK YOU THAT THAT'S YOUR THREE MINUTES OKAY THANK YOU THANK YOU APPRECIATE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MY NAME IS ADAM SCALE ON CALIFORNIA DIRECTOR WITH FOOD AND WATER WATCH WE ARE ALSO IN OPPOSITION TO REGIONALIZATION FOR MANY OTHER REASONS EXPRESSED ALREADY. WE ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT CONSUMERS AND FAMILIES BEING OVER CHARGED A WE ALREADY SEEN REPORTS IN THE LA TIMES THAT CALIFORNIA REPAIRS HAVE PAID OVER SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. FOR THE PROFITS OF SPECULATORS IN THIS IS CURRENTLY UNDER THE CURRENT GUY SO BOARD WHERE WE HAVE SOME SAY. IF WE'RE GOING TO GIVE UP THAT POWER TO AN RTO WHERE WE HAVE NO VOTE WE EXPECT THAT PROBLEM TO BE MUCH WORSE WERE ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT JOB LOSSES. AND WE WANT TO MAXIMIZE IN STATE RENEWABLE PRODUCTION WE WILL BE SENDING A LETTER THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS AND I'M ASKING SOME HERE ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA RENT SICILIANS AND REALLY ARE GRATEFUL FOR THAT OPEN TRANSPARENT PROCESS THAT. YOU'RE. I'M COMMITTEE HAS COMMITTED TO SPECIFIC BILL BUT SPECIFICALLY WANT TO ECHO SOME ON COMMENTS I MISS WAS LEADING THE RACE SPECIFICALLY IN HARM'S JUST COMMUNITIES AND HOW THIS NEW SCHEFFEL IMPACT IS COMMUNITIES. PACIFIC ON THE NATURAL GAS PIPELINES AND SPECIALLY THE PICKER PLANTS GIVEN THAT WE HAVE SEEN EMISSION INCREASES FROM THE. CALLUSES STUDY THAT CAME ABOUT HIM TWO YEARS AGO SEEM THAT AN INCREASE ON NATURAL GAS USAGE GIVEN THE NEW RUSSIA SO JUST KEEPING THAT IN MIND AND REALLY HAVING A CONVERSATION MOVING FORWARD ON HOW WE CAN ADDRESSES IN THIS BILL. THANK YOU THANK. HELLO MY NAME IS JONATHAN WITH PATTERN ENERGY WHERE OUT WHEN A NORTH AMERICA'S LARGEST RENEWABLE ENERGY SUPPLY COMPANIES. A WE DEVELOP WIND SOLAR STORAGE AND TRANSMISSION ARE BASED HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND WE SUPPORT THIS EFFORT. WE THINK IT'S THAT A FANTASTIC UP OPEN AND TRANSPARENT PROCESS WE THANK YOU AND APPLAUD AND APPLAUD THE THE BILL THAT'S COME FORWARD. WE UNDERSTAND THAT THERE HAS BEEN. SOME VERY SERIOUS CONCERNS RAISED WE BELIEVE THEY NEED TO BE ADDRESSED SERIOUSLY BUT WE DON'T FORGET THE CONTEXT. IT'S OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT A REGIONAL ROBUST MARKET A FOR NEW BILLS TO BUY AND SELL IN REAL TIME TO SEND THE POWER WHERE IT NEEDS TO GO WHEN IT'S BEEN PRODUCED. IS ESSENTIAL UP FROM EATING OUR CHEMICALS AS A BASELINE HE'S BEEN STRUCTURE WE THINK THE COST OF INACTION IS HIGHER EMISSIONS HIGHER COSTS TO CALIFORNIANS AND FEWER CALIFORNIA JOBS. WE LOVE TO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION AND LOOK FOR TO PURCHASE HIM PROCESS. GOOD AFTERNOON I'M VICTORIA ROOM WITH THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL. AND WE NEED TO SUPPORT THE WORK OF THE CHAIR AND YOUR STAFF AND. MOVING THIS PROCESS FORWARD AND OPEN TRANSPARENT WAY. WE THINK THAT REGIONALIZATION IS AN IMPORTANT PRIORITY FOR THE STATE AND WE NEED TO MOVE TO A CLEAN BRED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. REGIONALIZATION IS ONE WAY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DO THAT. EFFICIENTLY AND AFFORDABLY AND FINALLY I JUST WANT TO MENTION. WE DO NEED TO KEEP IN MIND LOCAL AIR QUALITY AND WE DON'T THINK REGIONALIZATION WILL MAKE THAT WORSE HOWEVER THAT'S. NOT SHOULDN'T BE THE ONLY CONSIDERATION WE CAN ALSO LOOK AT WAYS TO IMPROVE LOCAL AIR QUALITY THROUGHOUT THIS PROCESS THANK YOU. MR TURN MEMBERS SILVIUS ALICIA ON BEHALF OF ADVANCED ENERGY ECONOMY WHERE BUSINESS ASSOCIATION THAT REPRESENTS MANUFACTURERS DEVELOPERS AND USERS OF ADVANCE ENERGY PRODUCTS. I WERE HERE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF THE REGIONALIZATION PROPOSAL WE BELIEVE THAT IT WILL EXPAND THE MARKET FOR ADVANCED ENERGY PRODUCTS ACROSS THE BOARD. INCOME WITH TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITY FOR ADDITIONAL IN YOU PROJECTS JOBS AND EXPANSIONS IN THE WESTERN REGION INCLUDING CALIFORNIA. CURRENTLY THE ADVANCED ENERGY SECTORIS ONE OF THE FASTEST GROWING SECTORS OF THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY SURPASSING SOME SIGNATURE INDUSTRY SUCH AS THE FILM. MOTION PICTURE ESOS UP INDUSTRY AS WELL AS THE AG INDUSTRY SOBRE GROWING AND WE BELIEVE THIS WILL HELP US GROW EVEN FURTHER THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS DOWN A PRICE ON BEHALF THE FIX THE GREAT COALITION WHERE COALITION ENVIRONMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS. RENEWABLE ASSOCIATIONS ISRAEL'S RENEWABLE MANUFACTURERS. I DON'T THINK IT CAN BE SAID ENOUGH I WANT TO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE LEVEL TRANSPARENCY. AND DILIGENCE IN PROCESS AROUND THIS I THINK MOST FOLKS NO ONE HERE THAT THIS IS AN EFFORT THAT HAS BEEN UNDERTAKEN FOR THE LAST THREE YEARS. I BEHIND CLOSED DOORS WITHOUT LEGISLATOR IN PLAN I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE DAYLIGHT THIS BECAUSE THIS IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE. I ALSO WANT TO NOTE THAT IN THOSE CONVERSATIONS THERE ARE SOME IN HERE THAT HAVE MADE STATEMENTS. THAT WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT BECAUSE THEY WERE READY TO SIGN THOSE DEALS BEHIND CLOSED DOORS AND I DO HOPE THAT THEY HAVE THE CONVERSATION NOW. THAT THIS IS BEING DELIGHTED. I WANTED AND I'M SORRY THAT MR WHICH IS NOT HERE BECAUSE I WANTED TO KNOW WHERE HE CITED THAT HUNDRED AND TEN THOUSAND JOB LOSS HUNDRED TEN THOUSAND PEOPLE. AND LOSING THEIR JOBS. THE SAME STUDY THAT I BELIEVE HE WAS REFERENCING WHICH IS THE CALIFORNIA HIGHEST SO S. B. THREE FIFTY STUDY ACTUALLY SHOWS I HAVE A CHART HERE SHOULD ANYONE LOOK AT IT. ACTUALLY SHOWS THAT IF WE CONDUCT BUSINESS AS USUAL AND DO NOT. DO NOT ENGAGING REGIONALIZATION DISCUSSION THE BY TWENTY THIRTY THIS CAN BE NINETY THOUSAND NEW JOBS CREATED. IF WE DO CONSIDER REGIONALIZATION THERE WILL BE A HUNDRED AND TEN THOUSAND NEW JOBS CREATED TWENTY FIVE TO THIRTY THOUSAND OF WHICH ARE HIS HIGHLY SKILLED TECHNICALLY TRAINED WORKFORCE. IF WE WERE TO CONTINUE IN A DIFFERENT MODEL OF REGIONALIZATION THERE'S GOING TO BE ABOUT A HUNDRED THOUSAND JOBS CREATED SO I LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING THAT DISCUSSION AS WE GO THROUGH THIS PROCESS. AND VERY MUCH THANK YOU. EVEN. GIVE ME EVERYBODY THIS IS LARA NAVARRO WITH ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE FUND. WE WORK. ON INTEGRATING RENEWABLES I WILL SAY IN EVERY SINGLE WAY ON THIS CHART WE WANT TO SEE IF THIS IS THE CHART. WE WANNA SEE MORE RENEWABLES IN CALIFORNIA AND OF COURSE THE CROSS THE COUNTRY BUT CALIFORNIA IS THE LEADER. WE HAVE TO FACE THAT. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS POLICY REGIONALLY CAUSATION NOT ONLY WILL HELP US TO INTEGRATE RENEWABLES IT WILL HELP US TO EXPORT OUR RENEWABLE POLICIES TO OTHER STATES. AND THAT IS PURELY THROUGH THE FUNCTION OF THE MARKET. A IT ALSO IT'LL HELP LOWER GREENHOUSE GASES IN THE LONG TERM WE AGREE WITH AN RTC AND OTHERS THAT AIR QUALITY SHOULD BE LOOKED AT THIS IS NOT A SURPRISE TO ANY OF US IN CALIFORNIA. THERE ARE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES THAT HIGH WORST AIR QUALITY THAN OTHER PLACES WE WANT THERE TO BE SOLUTIONS TO THAT. I WOULD MENTION ALSO THAT. MANY THANK YOUS TO THE AUTHORS OFFICE AND AND. TO KELLY IN PARTICULAR WORKING A RUNNING A TERRIFIC PROCESS ON THIS AND REALLY TRYING TO INTEGRATE DE UM THE THOUGHTS OF MANY OF THE STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING THOSE THAT YOU HEARD HERE. ON THE PANEL TODAY. OVERALL I THINK THAT WE CAN GET THERE THROUGH THIS PROCESS TO A REGIONAL GRADE THAT IS REALLY SUPPORTIVE OF CALIFORNIA'S POLICIES. AND HELPS TO BRING RENEWABLES THROUGHOUT THE WEST. IT'S NOT THE ONLY THING WE HAVE TO DO BUT IT'S ONE AND IT'S VERY IMPORTANT. IN THE LAST THING I WANT TO KNOW IS THAT. I. CALIFORNIA IS AND WILL BE THE ONE TO DO ITS OWN PROCUREMENT IT IS THE WANT TO CHOOSE THE RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STANDARD. RESOURCES IT IS THE WIND TO BE ABLE TO ENFORCE ITS GREENHOUSE GAS POLICIES THROUGH THE MARKET. THESE THINGS DON'T CHANGE OR GO AWAY AND JUST IN CASE WE WERE WORRIED THAT THEY DO THEY ARE IN THE BILL. THIS IS ALREADY PROTECTED THE WAY THE BILL IS WRITTEN AND I THINK OF COURSE THE BILL COULD BE IMPROVED NO OFFENSE AUTHORITY STEVE BUT IT IS THERE IN STRUCTURE. SO THANK THANK. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS JOHN WHITE REPRESENTED CLEAN PARKING PAIN I WANT TO ECHO THE SENTIMENTS ABOUT OUR HEALTH REFRESHING THE PROCESS OF THAT YOU'VE EMBARKED ON AND THE FACT THAT WE'RE HAVING THESE CONVERSATIONS AND MARCH INSTEAD OF IN AUGUST. IS A GOOD SIGN THAT WE'RE GOING TO GET SOME WORK DONE OF OUR JUSTICE THE AYE SO SAID THAT THE REGIONAL EXPANSION IS NOT THE SOLE SOLUTION TO. PROBLEMS THAT WE HAVE CREATED IN OUR SUBSTANTIAL SUCCESS. NEITHER SHOULD WE THINK OF THE RENEWAL AS THE. REGIONAL GRID AS THE SOLUTION FOR ALL OF THE OTHER PROBLEMS THAT WE HAVE. NATURAL GAS POWER PLANT EMISSIONS ARE GOING UP. TODAY WITHOUT REGIONALIZATION BECAUSE OF THE WAY THE GRIDS OPERATING BECAUSE WE GOT FOURTEEN THOUSAND MEGAWATTS THAT WE HAD TO TURN BACK ON WHEN THE SUN GOES DOWN SO THAT'S A PROBLEM TODAY. A AND I THINK IT NEEDS ATTENTION TODAY SEPARATE FROM THIS BILL OR MAYBE AS POSTCARDS SECOND IS MISTER WHICH SAID THE THAT THE STAKES ON PROCUREMENT. IN TERMS OF JOBS ISN'T A VERY BIG CONCERN BUT I WOULD POINT OUT THAT AT THE MOMENT. WE'RE NOT DOING ANY PROCUREMENT IN CALIFORNIA UTILITIES BY ANYTHING CCA'S ARE JUST GETTING STARTED. WE ARE NOT BUILDING WHERE WE'RE BUILDING OUT WHAT WE'VE ALREADY BOUGHT. SO TO ME THINKING ABOUT HOW TO GET MORE CHIU THERMAL MORE LARGE SCALE STORAGE. OF MORE CLEAN PILE LAST THOSE ARE THINGS THAT AREN'T NECESSARILY THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE REGIONAL CURRENT. POLLS ON THERE THAT'S OTHER WORK WE NEED TO DO. K. BECAUSE PROCUREMENT IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY. I THINK THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO STRENGTHEN OUR PROTECTION VIS A VIS THE FEDS BY ALIGNING WITH THE WEST COAST GOVERNOR INSLEY GOVERNOR BROWN IN OREGON. A GOVERNOR SANDOVAL IN NEVADA ARE MUCH CLOSER TO OUR POINT OF VIEW ON ALL THESE MATTERS. THEN OUR OF THE TRUMP PEOPLE AND I THINK THE WAY THE BILL IS WRITTEN. IN TERMS OF REQUIRING REPORTING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. ACQUIRING CERTAIN CRITERIA TO BE MET FOR ANYBODY TO JOIN IS GONNA MAKE IT PROBABLY LESS LIKELY THAT UTAH WYOMING ARE GOING TO COME IN. RIGHT AWAY BECAUSE OF THE WAY WE'RE FRAMING THIS I THINK SO I THINK. PART OF WHAT'S GOING ON IS WE LITTLE BIT CHASING GHOSTS FROM PREVIOUS. DISCUSSIONS WERE PEOPLE WORRY THAT THEY'RE GONNA GET JAMMED AT THE END SESSION AND. WORST CASE SCENARIO I THINK WHAT WE HAVE NOW IS OPPORTUNITY TO FACE THE ISSUES THAT ARE BEFORE US. COME UP WITH SOLUTIONS SOME IN THIS BILL BUT SOME IN OTHER BILLS. BECAUSE GRANT WE HAVE MUCH WORK TO DO IF WE'RE GOING TO STAY ON TRACK IF WE'RE GOING TO LOWER COSTS AND IF WE'RE GONNA TO CREATE THIS THE LOW CARB GRITTED FUTURE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND I'D LIKE TO THANK ALL OF THOSE WHO US SPOKE WE APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS. AND I THINK IT. PROBABLY GOES DOZEN GO WITHOUT SAYING THAT THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT. PART OF HOW WE NEED TO GATHER INFORMATION. YOU KNOW I THINK ONE OF THE. THE BENEFICIARIES OF A MORE DETAILED. OUR EXTENDED PROCESS IS. THE PUBLIC. FOR US HEARING YOUR TESTIMONY TODAY HEARING THOSE THE COMMENTS THAT WE JUST HEARD ON PUBLIC COMMENT HELPS SHAPE. CONTINUE TO SAVE OUR OUR THOUGHTS AROUND THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE AND. WE RECOGNIZE THAT SOMETHING THIS COMPLICATED. HAS TO WORK THROUGH A PROCESS AND SO WE WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE THAT. DIALOGUE CONTINUE. THIS WILL NOT BE THE THE LAST. AS WAS POINTED OUT EARLIER. A CONVERSATION THAT THIS COMMITTEE WILL HAVE AROUND THIS TOPIC AND THAT WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO TAKE IN COURT SO THAT WE CAN SHAPE. AND MAKE A MORE PERFECT LEGISLATIVE PROPOSAL BUT LET ME ALSO SAY THERE'S NO PERFECT LEGISLATION. AND A SO I DON'T WANT US ALL TO HOLD OUT THAT. YOU KNOW WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING AT THE END. THAT IS GOING TO SATISFY. EVERY PERSON BOTH IN FAVOR REGIONALIZATION AND THOSE WHO OPPOSE WE'RE GONNA DO OUR VERY BEST. THOUGHT TO TAKE ALL OF THE THE COMMENTS AS THOUGHTFUL AS THEY ARE TRYING TO INTEGRATE THEM AS BEST AS WE CAN SO APPRECIATE YOU COMING OUT TODAY APPRECIATE THE MEMBERS FOR. BEING HERE AND BEING A PART OF THIS A DISCUSSION AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING ANOTHER HEARING AT SOME POINT IN THE NEAR FUTURE. TO CONTINUE GOING THANKS VERY MUCH
