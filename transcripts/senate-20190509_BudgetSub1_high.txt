OF THE FIRST OF BUDGET REQUEST OUR IS FUNDING FOR THE LATINO POLITICS INITIATIVE AT THE UCLA. SCHOOL OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS THIS PROGRAM HAS ALREADY DISTINGUISHED DISTINGUISHED ITSELF TO ITS RESEARCH POLICY AND CIVIC ENGAGEMENT. THE CAUCUS IS REQUESTING TWO POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY TO SUPPORT. OF THE INITIATIVES OPERATING BUDGET. THIS ADDITIONAL FUNDING WILL ALLOW FOR THE HIGHER OF SUPPORT STAFF. OF TO HELP MANAGE THE RESEARCH SUPPORT THE EXPANSION OF CIVIC ENGAGEMENT AND COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS. AND ALLOW FOR A WIDER DISSEMINATION OF DATA POLICY. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION ON THAT REQUEST AND FOR THE RECORD THAT'S ITEM TO A NEXT. OKAY OF THE SECOND OF ITEM I HAVE FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION IS A REQUEST TO EXPAND THE CALIFORNIA COLLEGE PROMISE. BY THE SECOND YEAR FREE TUITION FOR STUDENTS ATTENDING A COMMUNITY COLLEGE. THE POLICY PROPOSAL IS CONTAINED IN A.. TWO BY ASSEMBLYMAN SANTIAGO. THE MEASURE REQUIRES A TOTAL OF SIXTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE GENERAL FUND. TO BRING FINANCIAL RELIEF TO THOUSANDS OF STUDENTS ACROSS OUR STATE. OF A YOU KNOW OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM SERVES TWO MILLION STUDENTS AT A HUNDRED FIFTEEN COLLEGES AND IT VERY VERY DIVERSE. UP PROVIDING THE STUDENTS WITH THE SECOND YEAR OF FREE TUITION WILL PROVIDE. A WILL PROVE A HUGE RELIEF FOR THOUSANDS OF THOSE STUDENTS STRUGGLING TO MAKE ENDS MEET -- AND THIRD -- MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. OF THE LIKE THE CAUGHT THIS IS US SUPPORTING CONCERNS. FUNDING FOR THE AFTER SCHOOL EDUCATION THE SAFETY PROGRAM ALSO KNOWN AS A S. P. S.. A RECENT SHOWS OF COURSE THAT AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS PROVIDE A VARIETY OF BENEFITS TO STUDENTS. INCLUDING IMPROVE SCHOOL ATTENDANCE AND ENGLISH FLUENCY AND SOCIAL EMOTIONAL SKILL DEVELOPMENT. WE'RE REQUESTING A HUNDRED AND TWELVE MILLION FROM THE GENERAL. FUND. IN FISCAL YEAR. TWENTY NINETEEN OF FOR THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION WELL THE COSTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF A SCS PROGRAMS HAVE. CONSISTENTLY INCREASED. THE STATE'S INVESTMENT IN AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS HAVE NOT QUE KEPT PACE FOR OVER A DECADE. OUT WITHOUT ADDITIONAL FUNDS ARE AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS ARE FORCED TO CUT SERVICES FOR STUDENTS. AND SOME WILL EVEN SHUT DOWN. ON BEHALF OF THE LATINO CAUCUS THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. OF THESE PIORITY BUDGET REQUEST -- AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU SEN DRUGS SO YOU GET THE OF GOLD STAR FOR BREVITY. I CAN'T TELL YOU RIGHT NOW BEFORE I GAVE UP THANK YOU HAVE THIS ORDER [inaudible] NO [inaudible] JACKSON [inaudible] OTHERWISE. THAT'S A CHALLENGE I'M NOT SURE THE SOUL LAWYER CAN MATCH. FOR BREVITY BUT I HAVE TO REQUEST. ONE IS A MODEL SCHOOL LIBRARY STANDARDS FOR TWO HUNDRED AND FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS THE STANDARDS HAVE BEEN UPDATED SINCE SINCE. TWENTY TEN AND AS WE KNOW WE ARE SEEING A RAPIDLY EVOLVING LANDSCAPE -- WE NEED THE THIS THESE. IMPROVEMENTS TO PREPARE STUDENTS FOR THE FUTURE INFORMATION ECONOMY PART OF THIS DEALS WITH ME MEDIA LITERACY THE ABILITY TO THINK CRITICALLY ABOUT. THE SOURCES OF INFORMATION THAT THE STUDENTS ARE RECEIVING. TO DEAL WITH QUESTIONS OF FALSE NEWS FAKE NEWS -- THE WHOLE ISSUE OF DIGITAL CITIZENSHIP IN CYBER BULLYING WHICH WE KNOW IS HAVING A VERY SERIOUS IMPACT ON OUR USED TODAY. SO THAT IS A TWO HUNDRED FOUR THOUSAND DOLLAR ASK. THE SECOND ASK. IS THE TRIAL CARE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING FUNDING. INEQUITIES THE WORKING FAMILIES AND INDIVIDUALS FACES EVIDENT IN OUR STATE'S EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION SYSTEM WERE NEARLY 60% OF THE STATE'S CHILD CARE WORKFORCE RELIES ON GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS TO GET BY. AND A WORKING SINGLE MOTHER IS PAYING NEARLY 70% OF HER INCOME ONE CHILD CARE. THIS IS NOT SUSTAINABLE. IT'S NOT RIGHT AND I KNOW THE CALIFORNIA CAN AND MUST DO BETTER. SO THE RIGHT TO COLLECTIVE BARGAINING IS ALSO A MUST BECAUSE WE KNOW THERE ARE NO MORE VOICES. OTHER NO VOICES MORE KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT CALIFORNIA'S CHILD CARE NEEDS THAN. THE PRIMARILY WOMEN WHO CARE FOR AN EDUCATE OUR CHILDREN AND WHO FUEL OUR ECONOMY BY MAKING IT POSSIBLE FOR MOMS AND DADS. TO REPORT TO WORK SO I'M ASKING THE LEGISLATURE TO JOIN ELEVEN OTHER STATES. IN EMPOWERING CHILD CARE PROVIDERS TO BE ABLE TO FORM A UNION AND HAVE A SEAT AT THE TABLE TO EFFECTIVELY ADVOCATE. FOR THE CHILDREN AND FAMILIES THEY CARE FOR IN SUPPORT INCLUDING THEIR OWN SO THE SPECIFICALLY IS A TWO MILLION DOLLAR ASKING FUNDING TO ENSURE WE HAVE. ADEQUATE STAFFING AND NEEDED TECHNOLOGY ASSISTANCE OF DSS CD E. AND HER. THESE DOLLARS WOULD BE DEDICATED TOWARD COMPILING A LIST OF FAMILY CHILD CARE PROVIDERS WOULD MINISTER SAID STATE SUBSIDIZED CHILDCARE A BIG PROBLEM PEOPLE DON'T KNOW WHERE TO GO. SHOCKINGLY THE STATE CURRENTLY DOESN'T COLLECT THIS INFORMATION WHICH IS A CRITICAL COMPONENT TO ENSURING THAT WE ARE BUILDING THE STRONGEST. EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION POSSIBLE. ADDITIONALLY THIS FUNDING WOULD REQUIRE THAT PURRS A BOARD TO OVERSEE AND CERTIFY A UNION ELECTION FOR FAMILY CHILD CARE PROVIDERS THIS YEAR. AND IN SUPPORTING THIS ASK WE CAN BEGIN TO BUILD THE FOUNDATION FOR A CHILD CARE SYSTEM THAT SUPPORTS OUR EDUCATORS. RECOGNIZING THEM AS THE PROFESSIONALS THEY ARE AND HELP CHILDREN THRIVE FOR DECADES TO COME. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN EXCELLENT JOB FOR THE RECORD THOSE THAT WAS ITEM NUMBER ONE P. AND ITEM ONE HIM CORRECT. THANK YOU [inaudible] SIR GLAZER. YOU ARE PRESENTING ON ITEM TWO T.. TANGO. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS I AM HERE TO URGE YOU TO PROVIDE FULL FUNDING FOR THE CS USE GRADUATION INITIATIVE. I AN ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO BRING THE SYSTEMS MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAMS. CLOSER TO NATIONAL STANDARDS FOR THE NUMBER OF COUNTS. TO STUDENT RATIO. THESE ARE TWO CRITICAL ISSUES TO STUDENT SUCCESS. AS MANY OF YOU KNOW IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN THE CSU LAUNCH THE GRADUATION INITIATIVE. TWENTY TWENTY FIVE TO INCREASE FOREIGN SIX YOUR GRADUATION RATES TO FORTY AND 70% RESPECTIVELY. THE CSU HAS IMPROVED GRADUATION RATES FOR BOTH FIRST TIME FRESHMEN AND TRANSFER STUDENTS. BUT ADDITIONAL FUNDING IS NECESSARY FOR THIS TRAJECTORY TO CONTINUE. AND TO PROVIDE CAMPUSES WITH THE RESOURCES TO IT TO ELIMINATE THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP. SINCE TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN THE CSU SYSTEM. FOR YOUR GRADUATION RATE INCREASE FROM 19% 225%. I AND SIX YOUR GRADUATION RATES OF IMPROVED FROM 57% 261% THESE ARE MEASURABLE IMPROVEMENTS AND DOES THE FACULTY. ADMINISTRATION CAMPUS LEADERSHIP FOR THE WORK THAT THEY'VE DONE. ACHIEVEMENT GAPS HAVE NARROWED. FOR RACIAL AND ETHNIC GROUPS -- BUT ONLY NARROWLY. THERE'S A LOT MORE WORK TO TO BE DONE THERE. AND STUDENTS ARE GRADUATING WITH FEWER ACCESS UNITS. OVERALL THE SYSTEM HAS SHOWN IMPROVEMENTS. IN A NUMBER OF AREAS RELATED TO STUDENT PERFORMANCE AND CLOSING EQUITY GAPS -- BUT WE HAVE MORE WORK TO DO. THE CSU REQUESTED SEVENTY FIVE MILLION FOR THE GRADUATION INITIATIVE. BUT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IN JANUARY AT LEAST ONLY. PROVIDED FORTY FIVE MILLION. IN ADDITIONAL MILLION THIRTY MILLION THAT THEY'VE ASKED FOR IS DESERVING. I WOULD MEAN FOURTEEN HUNDRED MORE COURSE SECTIONS ENHANCED ADVISING AND IT. VAST ACADEMIC SUPPORT PROGRAMS. SO I HOPE YOU'LL CONSIDER THAT. I IN THE AREA OF MENTAL HEALTH. I'M HERE TO REQUEST AN ONGOING ALLOCATION OF FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS. NUMBER STUDENTS SEEKING HELP FOR SERIOUS MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS GUY ROCKET OVER THE LAST DECADE. SYSTEM WIDE THE NUMBER STUDENTS SEEKING MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ON CAMPUS INCREASED ABOUT 15% IN JUST THE PAST TWO YEARS. ALL ENROLLMENT WAS UP LESS THAN ADDITIONALLY WAIT TIME AT COUNSELING CENTERS CONTINUE TO BE AN ISSUE FOR STUDENTS. THEY HAVE TO WAIT FOR AN APPOINTMENT EVEN IN CRISIS SITUATIONS IN MANY CAMPUSES. THE AVERAGE WAIT TIME SYSTEM WIDE IS BETWEEN TWO AND FOUR WEEKS THINK ABOUT THAT. YOU'RE UNDER STRESS. TRYING TO COMPLETE YOUR STUDIES AND IT COULD BE ACADEMIC STRESS IT COULD BE PERSONAL STRESS. NINE WHEN YOU CALL THE COUNSELING OFFICE THEY SAY WE CAN SEE YOU AND AND A COUPLE WEEKS IT'S JUST NOT AN ACCEPTABLE SITUATION. I IN JANUARY THE GOVERNOR PROVIDED YOU SEE FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. TO ADDRESS MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS. BUT WE SHOULD DO THE SAME FOR THE CSU AND PROVIDE THAT ADDITIONAL FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR WORK. WITH THAT -- THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS FOR CONSIDERING THESE TWO IMPORTANT CLASS. THERE IN FORT INVESTMENTS OF IN OUR STUDENTS AND OUR STATE.

THE ESTIMATED COST TO MAKE THESE UPGRADES IS OVER FOURTEEN MILLION DOLLARS BUT THE CITY HAS SECURED TEN MILLION DOLLARS IN FUNDING AND IS REQUESTING ONLY FOUR POINT -- FOUR TO FINISH THE PROJECT. THESE FUNDS WOULD GO A LONG WAY TOWARD THE REBUILDING OF THE COMMUNITY AND IT'S BEEN. MUCH MUCH TOO LONG. THE LIBRARY IS IS SUCH A A SOURCE OF OF OF COMING TOGETHER IN THE COMMUNITY. THE LIBRARY IS A REGIONAL ATTRACTION AND HAS BECOME A REGIONAL CENTER FOR VETERANS TO ACCESS AND BECOME INFORMED ABOUT THE SERVICES THAT ARE STILL NEEDED TO THEM. AND MAKE AVAILABLE TO THE VETERANS OF THE COMMUNITY. THE CITY HAS WORKED TO FIND THE THE FUNDING AS I HAD MENTIONED THEY'VE BEEN WORKING ON IT FOR TWENTY YEARS NOW.

IN JULY OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE CALIFORNIA STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION CREATED THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNER ROAD MAP POLICY WHICH IS DOUBLE THE NUMBER OF EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS AND SERVICES FOR E. L. STUDENTS. HOWEVER THESE ARE WAS THAT THERE WAS A LACK OF FUNDING TO TRULY SUPPORT OUR EDUCATORS WHO WERE IMPLEMENTING OF THE ROADMAP.

CHARTER SCHOOL FACILITIES NO FROM -- THE THREAT. TO SAN JOSE STATE UNIVERSITY AND HEALTH PRETTY OF COURSE STATE BUILDING -- SERASA MEMBERS THANK YOU. FOR ALLOW ME TO PRESENT THIS REQUEST -- THIS IS A REQUEST FOR TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS -- GENERAL FUND TO BE OKAY TO SAN JOSE STATE UNIVERSITY BEGIN PLANNING. A MIXED USE HOUSING PROJECT. ASSEMBLY MEMBER KALRA AND I WILL BE PRESENTING THE SAME REQUEST WILL PRESENT OF THE ASSEMBLY ON PRODUCING AIR. HOW DOES A STATE? ADD SIGNIFICANT VALUE TO THE REGION IN THE STATE IS ONE OF THE LARGEST CAMPUSES IN OUR SYSTEM. BUT ISN'T URBAN CAMPUS ON ONLY NINETEEN DOWNTOWN CITY BLOCKS. IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO EXPAND ITS PHYSICAL FOOTPRINT. THE SILICON VALLEY REASON HAS MEDIAN RENTAL RATES AMONG THE HIGHEST IN THE IN THE NATION. THIS SOUNDS A STATE. LOSES AT LEAST ONE FACULTY OR STAFF CANDIDATE PER MONTH DUE TO HIGH HOUSING COSTS. IS A HORRIBLE HORRIBLE SITUATION. IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO EXPAND THE CAMPUS TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE GROWING COMMUNITY. BUT WE WILL WE SEE AN OPPORTUNITY. WE HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT THE POTENTIAL OF THE STATE OWN ALQUIST BUILDING. SO BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IS AN OUTDATED PROPERTY THE BLOCKS ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN THE VITAL PEDESTRIAN QUARTER. IN DOWNTOWN SAN JOSE IT'S NEXT TO A LIGHT RAIL STOP. DIRECTLY ACROSS THE THE FOR SALE FROM THE HAMMER THEATER OPERATED BY. SAN JOSE STATE UNIVERSITY IN THE CITY OF SAN JOSE. AND IS ONE BLOCK AWAY FROM THE CAMPUS. LOCATIONS A GREAT LOCATION BUT THE BUILDING IS UNSAFE. THERE'S NO PARKING FOR THE EMPLOYER VISITORS. AND OF COURSE IT DOESN'T MEET THE NEEDS OF PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES THAT USE THE STATE SERVICES THERE. IT COULD IT COULD BE SO MUCH MORE FOR SAN JOSE FOR STUDENTS AND FOR THE STATE. WE HOPE AND EXPECT BASED ON PLENARY DISCUSSIONS THAT THE OFFERED ALQUIST BUILDING WILL BE IDENTIFIED. BY THE STATE AS A CANDIDATE FOR DISPOSITION IN THE NEW FUTURE. IF REALIZE THE PROJECT COULD EXPAND THAT UNIVERSITY'S CLASSROOM SPACE. AN INCREASE THE HOUSING SUPPLY FOR FACULTY STAFF AND STUDENTS. THIS IS A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY THAT ALLOWS UNIVERSITY INCREASE HOUSING SUPPLY. THE FACULTY AND STUDENTS COULD AFFORD SMALL INVESTMENT IN THE PLANNING MONEY AT THIS TIME. ONE ABLE SOUNDS THE STATE TO PARTNER WITH THE STATE AND THE CITY. TO DEVELOP A CLEAR VISION. OF OR THE PROJECT ENABLE INPUT FROM KEY STAKEHOLDERS AND BILL SUPPORT IN COMMITMENTS FOR THE NEXT STEP. ARCHER APPROVAL FOR THIS -- IMPACTFUL REQUEST THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR [inaudible] SURE WILK. YOU'RE PRESENTING YOU ARE PRESENTING ON ITEM. ONE F.. SURE SCHOOL FACILITIES GRANT PROGRAM. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBER. AND REQUESTING THE COMMITTEE PROVE A TWENTY MILLION DOLLAR INCREASE IN THE CHARTER SCHOOL FACILITY GRANT PROGRAM TO COVER CURRENT AND FUTURE GROWTH IN THE PROGRAM. MY DISTRICT INCLUDES THREE CHARTER SCHOOLS BENEFITING FROM THE CHARTER SCHOOL FACILITY GRANT PROGRAM WHICH ENSURES WE HAVE QUALITY FACILITIES EVERY YEAR. IN ADDITION THE GRANT PROGRAM REIMBURSES SCHOOL SERVING HIGH PERCENTAGE OF LOW INCOME STUDENTS 475%. OF THEIR RENT OR LEASE COSTS -- SO THE GOVERNOR'S GOVERNOR PROPOSES A BASE FUNDING OF A HUNDRED THIRTY SEVEN MILLION TO THE PROGRAM IS THE SAME ANNOUNCED LAST YEAR AND YET ELIGIBILITY FOR THE PROGRAM CONTINUES TO GROW. AND FACILITY COSTS CONTINUE TO INCREASE WITHOUT ADDITIONAL FUNDING CUTS AS HIGH AS 20% TO EVERY SCHOOLS GRANT WILL RESULT IN THEM BEING FORCED TO SPEND ADDITIONAL GENERAL. GENERAL PARADING FUNDS UP FACILITIES HARMING THE PROGRAMS AND SERVICES THEY PROVIDE TO STUDENTS THIS IS ALMOST THE EQUIVALENT OF SEVENTY JR SELLERS TO PAY FOR THESE FACILITIES. FOR THESE REASONS ARE REQUEST THAT THE COMMITTEE CONSIDER A TWENTY MILLION DOLLAR INCREASE TO COVER THIS PROJECTED GROWTH ENSURE THE PROGRAM REMAINS FULLY FUNDED. I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR CONSIDERATION. EXCELLENT JOB CENTER WILL THANK YOU. SHADED BY PAGE [inaudible] THANK. I WILL BE PRESENTING THE ADDITIONAL BUDGET REQUESTS BUT I'M GOING TO DEFER DOING THAT UNTIL THE END OF OUR VARIOUS PANEL DISCUSSIONS AND AS I INDICATED I WILL TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT AS TO ALL. OF THESE ITEMS -- AT THE END OF OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE SESSION SO WITH THAT WHY DON'T WE PROCEED WITH OUR FIRST PANEL DISCUSSION IT'S ITEM SIXTY ONE HUNDRED ISSUE NUMBER THREE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION MENTAL HEALTH AND SCHOOLS LOCAL PERSPECTIVES. BUT RATHER THAN HAVING YOU SIT AND LISTEN TO ME READ THAT SHE WOULD RATHER BE PRESENTING TO US SO. WE'LL DO IT THAT WAY LET'S START WITH THE INTRODUCTIONS FOR THE RECORD TO MY LEFT YOU'RE RIGHT SIR. MANY. FIVE ASA COUNTY OFFICES. THIS NUMBER OF THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. MORNING I'M BLANCA CAVAZOS I'M A SUPERINTENDENT OF THE TAFT UNION HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT THANK YOU FOR COMING. GOOD MORNING -- MICHAEL MCCORMACK SUPERINTENDENT OF ALBERTINA FIGHT SCHOOL DISTRICT YOU FOR JOINING US SIR. WHO WANTS TO START? I'LL GO AHEAD AND BEGAN. YOU SHOULD HAVE SOME -- ONE PIECE OF PAPER UP THERE THAT'S FROM THE NATIONAL ALLIANCE ON MENTAL HEALTH. COMING OUR WAY OUTSTANDING. THE ONE STATISTIC ON THERE THAT STARTLING TO ME THAT I WANTED TO POINT OUT -- TO THE MEMBERS IN THE CHAIR. IS THE AVERAGE DELAY BETWEEN ONSET OF SYMPTOMS AN INTERVENTION. FOR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IS TEN YEARS. THAT'S A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF TIME [inaudible] AND THERE'S ABOUT TWENTY FOUR BILLS I THINK THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS IS CURRENTLY CONSIDERING AND WE'D WE'D LOVE TO SEE IF THERE CAN BE A STRATEGIC APPROACH -- MAYBE SOME SORT OF A COMMISSION OR A TASK FORCE THAT REALLY DIVES DEEPLY INTO. YOU KNOW CHALLENGES THAT -- THAT THAT WERE FACING -- WE REALLY BELIEVE THAT THERE IS A PROBLEM AND WE'RE SEEING EXTREME BEHAVIORS FROM YOUNGER AND YOUNGER STUDENTS SO MANY GIVE ME AN EXAMPLE OF A FIRST GRADE STUDENT IN MY SCHOOL DISTRICT THAT OCCURRED. IN THE LAST TEN DAYS. WITH THE STUDENT AT LUNCH EMPTIED OUT THEIR JUICE BOX. WENT TO THE RESTROOM URINATED IN THE JUICE BOX AND ATTEMPTED TO SERVE IT TO HIS FIRST GRADE CLASSMATES. SO WHAT YEAH FIRST GRADE SIX YEARS OLD. INTO THE THAT WELL THAT'S KIND OF AN EXTREME STORY. THE TEACHERS AND THE STAFF. WERE REALLY STRUGGLING WITH THE TYPE OF TRAUMA WE BELIEVE THAT THAT OUR STUDENTS ARE FACING AND HOME ENVIRONMENTS AND THEN OF COURSE. AS A PARTNER -- THE SCHOOLS -- WHAT WE KIND OF USED TO SEE IN THE PAST THOSE SAME KINDS OF STRATEGIES THAT OUR TEACHERS AND OUR SUPPORT STAFF WERE USED TO DEALING THAT WOULD THAT WOULD ACTUALLY WORK -- WERE NO LONGER SEEING THOSE SAME STRATEGIES WORK WITH THE ADDITIONAL -- TRAUMA THAT OUR STUDENTS SEEM TO BE BRINGING TO SCHOOL AND SO WE THINK THAT. THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME ADDITIONAL SUPPORT. TO TRAIN STAFF -- TO TO DEAL WITH THE CHALLENGES AND AND HELP OUR STUDENTS TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN IN THE SCHOOL SETTING. AND SO -- WE HAVE A COUPLE OF A COUPLE OF BOX [inaudible] MANY AS WHEN FOSTER CARE STE. COME TO OUR SCHOOL DISTRICT OR CHANGE SCHOOL DISTRICTS. EVERYBODY GETS IN A TWIST OF THOSE STUDENTS ARE NOT ENROLLED WITHIN SEVENTY TWO HOURS. THE CHALLENGE THAT WE FACE IS VERY OFTEN TIMES THE STUDENTS ARE RECEIVING TREATMENT AND WRAPAROUND SERVICES. IN THEIR PREVIOUS SCHOOL DISTRICT. AND IN SOME CASES IT'S NOT HEARD OF THAT IT'S TWO THREE FOUR FIVE MONTHS. TRANSFERRED FROM THE THE TRANSFERRING COUNTY. TO THE COUNTY THAT IS RECEIVING THE STUDENT AND SO WHAT THAT MEANS. IS STUDENTS ARE COMING IN AND THE SERVICES THAT THEY USED TO RECEIVE ARE NOT FOLLOWING THEM IN A TIMELY FASHION. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY SOME OF THE MEDICATIONS THAT THEY WERE PRESCRIBED THE WERE THEY RUN OUT THE REFILL IS NOT AVAILABLE. AND SO NOW WE HAVE STUDENTS WHO ARE RECEIVING THE COUNSELING AND THERAPEUTIC SERVICES. AND THEY ALSO ARE RECEIVING -- THE MET MEDICATION THAT'S BEEN PRESCRIBED BY THE MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL. AND YOUR RESPECTIVE OF YOUR PHILOSOPHY OR YOUR THOUGHTS ON MEDICATION FOR THESE THESE SERVICES. THE REALITY IS THAT THE SERVICES ARE NOT IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE STUDENTS IN A TIMELY FASHION. SO. THAT'S THAT'S ONE THING FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION -- THE OTHER THING THAT THAT WE THINK IS IMPORTANT FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. IS THAT SOCIAL EMOTIONAL LEARNING BE PART OF TEACHER TRAINING PROGRAMS YOU KNOW START AND THAT'S KIND OF THE LONG GAME -- BUT WE THINK THAT IF TEACHERS ARE COMING INTO THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SETTING AND THEY'VE HAD SOME INSTRUCTION. IN SOME DISCUSSIONS AND SOME ABILITY TO LEARN SOMETHING MORE ABOUT SUPPORTING STUDENTS THROUGH SOCIAL EMOTIONAL LEARNING PROGRAMS WHEN THEY ARRIVE INTO OUR SCHOOLS WE THINK THAT WOULD BE. EXTREMELY HELPFUL. JUST THE FINAL THING I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT BEFORE A SHOW MY COLLEAGUES SHARE. IS THAT THE ASSOCIATION A CALIFORNIA ADMINISTRATORS. HAS A TASK FORCE ON MENTAL HEALTH. AND WE'RE HERE TO SHARE AND COLLABORATE IN ANY WAY THAT MAKES SENSE. WE BELIEVE THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT ISSUE THAT ARE CALIFORNIA -- EDUCATORS ARE FACING TODAY THANK YOU YES MA'AM. JUST WANNA GIVE YOU A PICTURE -- AS I START OF ARE DISTRICTS SO THAT AS I SPEAK YOU CAN. ENVISION WHAT THIS IS LIKE -- WE ARE SMALL HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT WITH ROUGHLY A THOUSAND STUDENTS ATTENDING. EITHER. OUR HIGH SCHOOL OR OR ALTERNATIVE EDUCATION SITES SO WERE RELATIVELY SMALL. A 60% 67% OF OUR STUDENTS ARE ARE SO SO ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED UP 48% ARE WHITE FORTY FIVE PERCENTERS PANIC AND ABOUT 7% OF THEM ARE ENGLISH LEARNERS IN ABOUT 10%. FOR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES WE'RE IN A RURAL COMMUNITY ABOUT THIRTY MILES WEST OF BAKERSFIELD AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY. OF IN IN A COMMUNITY WITH ABOUT NINE THOUSAND RESIDENTS THAT ARE PRIMARILY EMPLOYED IN OIL AND AGRICULTURE. THE MEDIAN INCOME IS ABOUT FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR AND OUR UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IS ALMOST 16% IN MARCH WHICH IS ABOUT FOUR TIMES AS MUCH AS THE STATE AVERAGE -- YOU POST THREE QUESTIONS OF US AND AND I WANT TO START OUT WITH THE FIRST ONE IN THE FIRST ONE WAS ONE OF THE MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS OF YOUR STUDENTS AND HAVE THESE CHANGED OVER TIME. AND I WANT TO START OUT BY -- JUST GIVING YOU SOME RAW DATA. ERROR A HIGH SCHOOL -- WE DID AN ACTIVITY FOR THE FIRST TIME WHICH IS CALLED I WISH MY TEACHER NEW. AND A HUNDRED AND SIXTY SIX OF OUR FRESHMEN STUDENTS ARE ABOUT ACTIVITY IN THEIR ENGLISH CLASSES AT THE HIGH SCHOOL -- THIS DOESN'T INCLUDE THE ALTERNATIVE EDUCATION SITE BECAUSE I THINK THE ALTERNATIVE EDUCATION SITES WOULD SHOW MUCH MORE STARK STATISTICS -- I HAVE -- PROVIDED FOR YOU UP PICTURES OF A BULLETIN BOARD. OF IN WHAT THE ACTIVITY WAS WAS THAT THE TEACHER ASKED STUDENTS TO RESPOND TO THIS PROMPT I WISH MY TEACHER NEW AND HAVE THE STUDENTS. WRITE THEIR RESPONSE ON POST IT AND SO THESE ARE ANONYMOUS. RESPONSES ARE I'M GIVING YOU AN OVERALL SHOT AND THEN GRADUALLY CLOSER SHOTS OF THIS IS RAW DATA. SEVENTY OF THESE OR 42% OF THEM INDICATE THAT STUDENT IS FUNCTIONING UNDER SOME SORT OF DURESS -- AND IF YOU LOOK AT SOME OF THE POST IT NOTES IT INCLUDES A STUDENT THAT TALKS ABOUT HAVING BEEN RAPED. IT TALKS ABOUT A STUDENT WHO'S DEALING WITH THEIR GRANDPARENTS -- BECOMING PROGRESSIVELY ILL AND MOVING INTO A WHEEL CHAIR -- STUDENTS THAT -- HAS HAD A PARENT DIE RECENTLY FOLLOWED BY A SUICIDE OF A SIBLING THESE ARE JUST -- OUT OF A HUNDRED AND SIXTY SIX STUDENTS THIS IS JUST. A SAMPLING FOR YOU I FELT THAT THIS WAS -- MORE OR LESS OUT OF-THE MOUTH OF BABES THIS IS WHAT OUR STUDENTS ARE TELLING US AND IT ISN'T ALL OUR STUDENTS IT'S A SMALL SAMPLING OF OUR STUDENTS -- I SPOKE TO OUR SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGIST. OF TO TO FIND OUT HOW MANY OF OUR STUDENTS ARE DEALING WITH THE DEATH OF A PARENT. AND SHE REPORTED THAT. SHE HAS DEALT WITH THESE ARE THE STUDENTS THAT WE KNOW OF AND AGAIN THIS IS A SWEET -- DISTRICT OF A THOUSAND I SHE'S WORKED WITH SIX FRESHMEN WHO HAVE LOST A PARENT SIX SOPHOMORES TO JUNIORS AND FOR SENIORS WHO ARE DEALING WITH THE LOSS OF A PARENT. AND THERE ARE -- GRIEF SUPPORT SERVICES ARE NOT -- READILY AVAILABLE IN THE COMMUNITY SHE'S HAD FIFTY EIGHT MEETINGS AND AND AGAIN WE ONLY HAVE ONE SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGIST TO THE THOUSAND STUDENTS SHE SAID FIFTY EIGHT MEETINGS WITH STUDENTS WHO OF SELF REFERRED TO BEEN. REFERRED BY AN ADULT -- DEALING WITH AGAIN GRIEF -- I ALSO SPOKE TO OR DRUG AND ALCOHOL INTERVENTION SPECIALIST WHO'S BEEN WORKING WITH TEENS AND ADULTS FOR OVER THIRTY TWO YEARS WE CONTRACT WITH HIS -- COMPANY WITH HIS BUSINESS FOR THE SERVICES AND HE'S WORKED WITH OUR DISTRICT FOR FOURTEEN OF THOSE THIRTY TWO YEARS. ON AVERAGE HE SEES ABOUT. SIXTY TO NINETY OF OUR STUDENTS I IN THE DISTRICT PER YEAR HE WORKS IN OUR COUNTY WITH ABOUT -- THREE HUNDRED TO FOUR HUNDRED TEENS IN. IN THEIR INTENSIVE OUTPATIENT PROGRAMS. HE ESTIMATES THAT 90% OF THESE TEAMS HAVE A DUAL DIAGNOSIS OF DEPRESSION ANXIETY BI POLAR AT CETERA. AND THEY USE DRUGS AND ALCOHOL TO SELF MEDICATE TO DEAL WITH THESE. ISSUES -- AND HE SAID THAT SINCE THE THE YEAR -- TWO THOUSAND PROFESSIONALS IN HIS IN HIS FIELD HAVE SEEN A TREMENDOUS INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF YOUTH ABUSING DRUGS AND ALCOHOL AND NOW. IT HAS STARTED REACHING STUDENTS AS EARLY AS FOURTH GRADE. AND I YOUR YOUR SECOND QUESTION WAS WHAT STRATEGIES AT THE DISTRICT OR SCHOOL LEVELER TARGETING MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. AND WHERE ARE THERE GAPS OR OR WHAT NEEDS. THAT WE HAVE THE KANATA THAT WE CANNOT FILL. OUR WE'VE DONE -- PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT FOR STAFF IN SUICIDE PREVENTION AND WHEN I SPEAK ABOUT STAFF I'M SPEAKING NOT ONLY ABOUT OUR TEACHERS BUT EVERY ADULT THAT WORKS IN OUR DISTRICT. AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS THAT STUDENTS HAVE A DEVELOP RELATIONSHIPS WITH -- NOT ONLY TEACHERS BUT ALSO THEIR BUS DRIVER THE CUSTODIAN THE THE PERSON WHO WORKS IN THE CAFETERIA AT SEVERANCE SO WE THINK THAT IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THEY HAVE THIS TRAINING -- AS WELL WE'VE HAD OUR TEACHERS -- GROUP OF TEACHERS TRAINED IN TRAUMA INFORMED PRACTICES AND OF COURSE -- THE B. I. S. POSITIVE BEHAVIOR INTERVENTIONS AND SUPPORTS. AS FAR AS OUR OUR TRAINING WE ACTUALLY HAD A MEETING -- JUST THIS WEEK WITH OUR STAKEHOLDERS. IN PLANNING OUR EL CAP AND WE DISCUSSED THIS VERY ISSUE NOT BECAUSE I WAS COMING HERE BUT BECAUSE IT IS SUCH A PRESSING ISSUE. FOR US IN EDUCATION AND SO FOR OVER THE NEXT -- SCHOOL YEAR WE ARE OUR TEACHERS OUR STAFF WILL BE RECEIVING TRAINING AND SOCIAL EMOTIONAL ACADEMIC LEARNING -- WE WILL ALSO HAVE -- PROFESSIONAL COME IN WHO SPECIALIZES IN GRIEF -- PERCENT ON GRIEF SUPPORT STRATEGIES. AND ALSO -- ANOTHER PROFESSIONAL THAT WILL PRESENT ON STRESS REDUCTION STRATEGIES AND STRESS REDUCTION STRATEGIES NOT ONLY. FOR THE STUDENTS BUT AS WELL FOR THE ADULTS WE LIVE IN A VERY VERY STRESSED SOCIETY -- WE'VE ALSO -- IMPLEMENTED MULTI TIERED SYSTEMS OF SUPPORT IN BOTH THE PERSONAL AND ACADEMIC AREAS -- WE'VE CREATED A PERSONALIZED ACADEMIC CENTER SO WE'VE MOVED OUR INDEPENDENT STUDY PROGRAM FROM WHAT IS HAS BEEN TRADITIONALLY. A ONE HOUR A WEEK ONE ONE TIME YOU KNOW ONE HOUR A WEEK -- TO A THREE HOUR PER DAY PROGRAM WHERE STUDENTS COME IN AND WORK INDIVIDUALLY -- ON THE COMPUTER WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF AN EDUCATOR. AND IN ADDITION TO THAT THE SO IT'S THREE HOURS A DAY AND THEN THEY ALSO RECEIVE SUPPORT FROM A COUNSELOR THAT MEETS WITH THEM. ARE WE HAVE TO CALL COHORTS WHEN THE BEATS IN THE MORNING AND ONE THAT MEETS -- IN THE AFTERNOON. AND WE BELIEVE THAT THAT COUNSELING SUPPORT IS CRITICAL SOME OF THOSE STUDENTS ARE IN THAT PROGRAM BECAUSE OF ANXIETY ISSUES WHERE THEY CAN NOT ATTEND. A TRADITIONAL -- SIX PERIOD SEVEN PERIOD DAY AND AND WITH. WE'RE SMALL WERE SMALL WERE SMALL. DISTRICT WERE SMALL I SCHOOL AND FOR THEM IT'S TOO MANY PEOPLE TO BE IN THE ROOM WITH AT THE SAME TIME -- WE ALSO HAVE -- HAVE A AN EDUCATOR WHO CONDUCTS GROUPS OF FOR STUDENTS THAT ARE. REFERRED TO ALTERNATIVE TO SUSPENSION SO THESE ARE STUDENTS SUSPEND DOUBLE BUT INSTEAD THEY WORK WITH THIS EDUCATOR AND ON THE SPECIFIC CURRICULUM AND THEN SHE ALSO HOLDS GROUPS WITH THEM. WE'VE. ALSO ADDED TO OUR CURRICULUM OF COURSE CALLED HUMAN ELEMENT WHICH THE STUDENTS IN THAT COURSE DESIGN POSITIVE ACTIVITIES FOR STUDENTS AND HELP CREATE WELCOMING -- THE WELCOMING LEARNING ENVIRONMENT. YOU ASKED ABOUT THE GAPS. THE GAPS ARE ONE OF THE THE HUGE GAPS THAT EXIST IS THAT THERE ARE REALLY NO IN BETWEEN SERVICES FOR STUDENTS WHO IS IN CRISIS. BUT YET THEY ARE NOT A DANGER TO THEMSELVES OR OTHERS OR HAVE NOT VIOLATED THE LAW WE HAVE A STUDENT -- LAST YEAR WHO WAS ABSOLUTELY IN PRICES DID NOT WANT -- TO BE AROUND HIS FAMILY WE ARE -- A SCHOOL RESOURCE OFFICER COULD NOT TRANSPORT HIM TO BAKERSFIELD THIRTY MILES AWAY. IN ORDER TO RECEIVE THE TREATMENT THAT HE NEEDED BECAUSE HE HADN'T YET HARM HIMSELF OR OTHERS OR VIOLATED THE LAW. THERE IS A A LOCAL -- SERVICE BUT IT DID SERVICE PRIMARILY. THAT ARE ON MEDICARE ALL IN HIS FAMILY HAD INSURANCE HE DID NOT WANT HIS FAMILY TO TRANSPORT HIM TO BAKERSFIELD. HE DID NOT WANT TO BE AROUND THEM. WE WERE NOT ABLE -- TO GET ANY SERVICES FOR HIM UNTIL HE HARM THE FAMILY DOG. AND AND THAT'S REALLY REALLY UNFORTUNATE SO WE NEED THOSE IN BETWEEN SERVICES AND WE NEED SOMEWHERE WHERE WE CAN REFER TO THE STUDENTS AND THAT THEY CAN THERE NEEDS OUT WHEN THEY ARE IN CRISIS CAN BE. ADDRESSED IMMEDIATELY WE ALSO NEED TO ADDRESS THE DIFFERENT FUNDING STREAMS. THERE'S A CROSSOVER HERE BETWEEN HEALTH. AND EDUCATION AND AND ALSOTHEY HAVE DIFFERENT REGULATIONS AND DIFFERENT ETHICAL CODES THAT THE FOLLOW THAT GOVERN. FOR EXAMPLE THE SCHOOL COUNSELOR THE SOCIAL. WORKER AND SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGISTS. WE NEED THAT ALIGNMENT -- BETWEEN THOSE SERVICES -- WE NEED TO FACILITATE THE LEGAL ABILITY FOR EACH. ENTITY TO SHARE INFORMATION WITH EACH OTHER IN ORDER TO BETTER SERVE OUR STUDENTS AND FAMILIES -- SOMETIMES FOR BUT GETS IN THE WAY -- AS HAS BEEN DONE IN THE PAST WITH STUDENT SERVICES AND FOSTER CARE SERVICES. ARE THERE ARE DIFFERENT -- CONFIDENTIALLY CONFIDENTIALITY REQUIREMENTS FOR EACH OF THOSE -- THREE A PROFESSIONS THAT I MENTIONED THERE'S ALSO DIFFERENT CREDENTIALING SCHOOL COUNSELORS AND A SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGIST CAN BE CREDENTIALED BUT THE SOCIAL WORKER IF WE HIRE THEM THEY HAVE TO BE A CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEE -- WE NEED GRIEF COUNSELING AND SUPPORT -- ESPECIALLY FOR AND AND JUST MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ESPECIALLY IN RURAL AREAS WHERE THE AVAILABILITY OF THOSE SERVICES IS SLIM TO NONE. AND OVERALL JUST MORE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES NOT ONLY FOR YOU BUT ALSO FOR THE ADULTS THE PARENTS IN THE AREA -- AND THEN YOUR LAST QUESTION WAS WHAT OTHER NON EDUCATION SUPPORT IS AVAILABLE IN YOUR COMMUNITY INCLUDING ANY PARTNERSHIPS WITH ANY OTHER AGENCIES SURE RESPONSIBILITIES FOR SUPPORTING FAMILIES WERE STUDENTS AND IN TAFT WE HAVE OF THE WEST SIDE HEALTH CARE DISTRICT AND I'VE MET WITH THEM ECAUSE THEY DO NOT. PROVIDE MENTAL HEALTH CARE THEY ARE PROVIDE MENTAL MEDICAL AND ARE A SOON GOING TO BE LOOKING AT DENTAL -- SERVICES BUT TO A MEETING WITH THEM -- THEY ARE INTERESTED IN PARTNERING WITH THE DISTRICT AND AND SCHOOLS AND BUT THEY'RE LOOKING AT GRANT OPPORTUNITIES. IN ORDER TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN AND AND WE ARE MORE THAN WILLING TO PARTNER WITH THEM IN WRITING THOSE GRANTS -- THERE ALSO IS -- COLLEGE COMMUNITY SERVICES WHICH SERVICE MEDI CAL ELIGIBLE ELIGIBLE. FOR IN THOSE THAT DO HAVE INSURANCE THAT MEANS THAT FOR OUR RESIDENTS -- OUR STUDENTS -- THAT. THAT ARE. IN THAT ARE ARE IN THOSE SITUATIONS THEY HAVE TO TRAVEL AT LEAST THIRTY MILES ONE WAY IN ORDER TO RECEIVE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. AND THERE ALSO IS NO IMPATIENT AND OR A VERY LIMITED EMERGENCY SERVICES FOR STUDENTS IN CRISIS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR. SO I A CARRY A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT OF A PERSPECTIVE I COME FROM A COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION AND OUR GOAL AND OUR ROLE IS TO SUPPORT. DISTRICTS SO ALL ANSWER THE QUESTIONS THAT YOU POSED DRESS KIND OF FROM THAT COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION LANDS -- START IN WITH -- THE THE DATA THAT THEY PRESENTED TO YEAR ROUND MENTAL HEALTH AND THEIR NEEDS -- FOR STUDENTS AND STAFF. WHO ARE IN OUR SYSTEMS THERE IS A REAL CRITICAL CHANGE IN EDUCATION WITH THE PASSAGE OF OF AB ONE FOURTEEN MOVE AND THE RESPONSIBILITY OF MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FROM COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS? MORE TOWARDS A SCHOOL DISTRICTS FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION. I THINK THAT WAS A REAL TURNING POINT IN EDUCATION BECAUSE IT HELPS TO RAISE THE AWARENESS OF THE EDUCATION COMMUNITY. AND REALLY HELP -- TO SHIFT THE TIED FOR EDUCATORS AND UNDERSTAND AND WHAT OUR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES GOING THROUGH -- ONE OF THE QUESTIONS YOU POSED AS WAS THERE HAS THERE BEEN A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE AND AND MENTAL ILLNESS OR THE NEEDS OF OF STUDENTS AND I THINK. FOR EDUCATION PARTLY WE'VE IDENTIFIED WE'VE BECOME MORE AWARE THEY ILLUSTRATED SEVERAL PROGRAMS. SO ARE A CUTIE OF UNDERSTANDING WHAT'S HAPPENING OUR KITTY OF UNDERSTAND AN ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES. HAS INCREASED GREATLY -- THAT HAS REALLY KINDA GIVEN US AN OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK AT PARTNERSHIPS. THE NEXT QUESTION YOU ASKED IS -- WHAT STRATEGIES ARE WE YEARS AND IN OUR DISTRICTS ARE FROM MY COUNTY PERSPECTIVE IN PLASTER COUNTY? TO JUDGE DRESS THOSE CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE IN OUR COMMUNITY OR IN COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STREET THIS. STATE IS SO THAT FORMER CHILDREN SYSTEM OF CARE SO WE HAVE A THIRTY ONE YEAR. SYSTEM OF CARE OF INTEGRATED SERVICES IN PLASTER COUNTY THAT FOCUS ON AND IT AND INTEGRATED COLLABORATION MY STAFF FROM THE COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. LITERALLY SET NEXT TO SOCIAL WORKERS BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROVIDERS PUBLIC HEALTH NURSES MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS AT THE COUNTY LEVEL. AND WE'VE BEEN DOING THAT FOR SOME TIME I HELP TO COORDINATE THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IN PLASTER COUNTY FOR SCHOOLS. BY A FUNDING FOR THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT PLANT IN COMMUNITY BASED AGENCIES INTO SCHOOLS AND SUPPORT AND HAVE A SYSTEMS PERSPECTIVE WHAT KINDS OF INTERVENTIONS DO WE HAVE THE COUNTY OFFICE ALSO COORDINATES. THE SUICIDE PREVENTION -- STRATEGIES FOR THE COUNTY NOT JUST FOR EDUCATION BUT FOR THE WHOLE COUNTY. AND THAT'S WORKS -- REALLY WELL OVER THE YEARS BUT WE KNOW WE'RE NOT ADDRESS AND ALL OF OUR STUDENTS YOU HEARD THE GAPS THE IN BETWEEN -- IS PLAYING PLASTER COUNTY WE LOOKED AT THAT HIGHER AND PART OF THE SYSTEM THAT THE STUDENTS WHO ARE AT AMMON AT RISK -- IN EDUCATION WE CALL THEM STUDENTS WITH TIER THREE NEEDS [inaudible] AND SO. WE'VE REALLY BEEN GONE FOR A CHEF TO IDENTIFY THE GAPS BETTER AND SOME OF THOSE GAPS INCLUDE HAVE AN A. INTEGRATED CONTINUUM OF SERVICES. AT THE SCHOOL SITE SO UP UNTIL NOW IT'S BEEN AT THE COUNTY LEVEL TYPICALLY BUT WHAT IS AN INTEGRATED SYSTEM LOOK LIKE LITERALLY AT A SCHOOL SITE. WHERE PEOPLE ARE COLLABORATING WITH COMMUNITY BASED AGENCIES ON INTEGRATED TEAMS SO THAT'S BEEN A GAP OF UNTIL NOW IT'S STARTING TO HAPPEN IN CALIFORNIA BUT NOT AS? AS AS WE LIKE TO SAY. ALSO WE WE TEND TO LOOK AT STUDENTS WHO ARE AT ADMIN AT RISK AND WE HAVEN'T BEEN REALLY GOOD AT LOOKING AT DATA. SO LOOKING AT DATA ACROSS A SCHOOL SIDE ACROSS THE DISTRICT ACROSS THE STATE WHAT TYPES OF SERVICES AND SUPPORTS DO WE HAVE UNIQUELY TO US AT TAFT AT PLASTER. IS EVERY SCHOOL SITE WILL HAVE UNIQUE AND DIFFERENT NEEDS. SO. ONE OF THE THINGS I ADVOCATE FOR A LOT A LOT FOR IS OPPORTUNITY FOR DISTRICTS TO WORK WITH THEIR MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS TO WORK WITH OUR COMMUNITY. TO IDENTIFY WHAT TYPES OF SUICIDE PREVENTION PROGRAMS DO WE NEED AT TAPPED OR DO WE NEED AT ROSWELL CITY SCHOOL DISTRICT. THE QUESTION ABOUT -- WHAT ARE THE NON EDUCATIONAL SERVICES OUR COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS THE GAPS KIND OF LATE IN TO THAT? AT WE HAVE A A WONDERFUL OPPORTUNITY GIVEN TO US AND PLASTERED FOR THE MENTAL HEALTH OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION. THAT IS ENHANCE AND THE SYSTEM OF CAE THAT WE HAD AT THIS HIGH LEVEL. AND HELPING US IN PLASTER ALONG WITH FOUR OTHER COUNTIES TO PUSH THAT DOWN INTO THE SCHOOL SITE. I'M NOT JUST THE DISTRICT LEVEL BUT RIGHT INTO THE SCHOOL SITE AND CREATE AN INTEGRATED SYSTEM. WITHIN A SQUALL WHERE WE CAN LEARN THE THE PROJECT IS ORGANIZED AROUND BEING A DEMONSTRATION PRODUCT. OF PROJECT SO WE CAN LEARN HOW DO WE COMMUNICATE. WE HAVE BETWEEN HAPPEN FOR PA -- HOW DO WE SET UP A SYSTEM WHERE WE CAN HAVE REGULAR ROUTINE TEAM MADE ENDS HOW DO WE CREATE A NOT JUST A WELLNESS CENTER AT A SCHOOL SITE BUT A WELLNESS? CAMPUS WITH PARTNERS. AND WE'RE FORTUNATE TO HAVE THIS OPPORTUNITY THROUGH THE COMMISSION TO DO THAT. BUT I CAN'T EMPHASIZE ENOUGH TO STRATEGIES AND AND WE JANET ACTUALLY MEET BEFORE TODAY. THAT MY COLLEAGUES TO THE LEFT TALKED ABOUT IS THAT WE DO THAT AND AND NOT JUST AN INTEGRATED WAY BUT THAT WE USE MULTI TIERED SYSTEMS OF SUPPORT. TO LOOK AT HOW WE SCAFFOLD THOSE SUPPORTS TERRACE SCHOOL SITE. AND THAT WE USE A FRAMEWORK OF POSITIVE BEHAVIOR INTERVENTIONS AND SUPPORTS SO THAT WE CAN GROUND AND SUPPORT STUDENTS AT A SCHOOL SITE. HELPING STUDENTS WHO HAVE AN RECEIVE SOCIAL EMOTIONAL LEARNING AND OR DON'T UNDERSTAND THE SOCIAL SKILLS THEY NEED TO NAVIGATE. SO I THINK A LOT OF TIMES WITHOUT D. V. I. S. AT A SCHOOL SITE WE TEND -- TO END OF CORRUPTION THE DATA BECAUSE CHILDREN COME FROM SO MANY DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS WE DON'T EVEN KNOW IF THEY WERE TAUGHT -- BASIC SOCIAL PROTOCOLS AND RESPONSIBILITIES SO. THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE A SOLID FRAMEWORK THAT WE SCAFFOLD. THE TYPES OF SUPPORTS THAT THEY TALKED ABOUT TO SOCIAL EMOTIONAL LEARNING MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORTS IN AN EFFECTIVE WAY. THAT'S EVIDENCE BASED AND DRIVEN BY DATA. WE'RE NOT JUST REACT IN ALWAYS TO STUDENTS WITH TEAR THREE NEEDS BUT WE MOVED DOWN THE CONTINUE ANSWERS SUPPORT STUDENTS EARLIER. I WHEN WHEN HONESTLY IT'S CHEAPER. IT'S MORE EFFECTIVE AND IT'S MORE FAMILY FRIENDLY. THE LAST THING I'LL SAY IS ABOUT FAMILIES WE NEED AN EDUCATION. TO EVERY PART OF THE PROCESS AND NOT JUST FAMILIES BUT OLDER YEARS. AS I GET IN THE MIDDLE SCHOOL AND HIGH SCHOOL AND HEAR THOSE VOICES. AND HAVE THEM HELP US IDENTIFY WHAT ARE OUR NEEDS AS A FAMILY WHAT ARE OUR NEEDS IN THE COMMUNITY. AND LITERALLY HAVE THEM BE PART OF THAT AND TSS TEAM TO DECIDE WHAT TYPES OF SERVICE I PREVENTION PROGRAM DO WE NEED. IN OUR COMMUNITY OR AT THIS -- SCHOOL THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATIONS AND FOR THE EXCELLENT WORK YOU'RE DOING ON THIS VERY VERY IMPORTANT TOPIC. LET ME TELL YOU A STORY -- WAS THIS YEAR I BELIEVE. I WAS IN MY OFFICE AND I WAS VISITED BY SOME OF THE PTA. MEMBERS WHO ALSO BROUGHT SOME STUDENTS ALONG. ETCETERA MY TABLE AND SOME OF THE STUDENTS SAID IN THE COUCH IN THE OFFICE AND THERE WAS A YOUNG MAN ON THE COUCH IN -- AFTER THE PARENTS. HAVE FINISHED. ASKING ME QUESTIONS AND MAKING THEIR COMMENTS OF THE GIVE THIS YOUNG MAN AN OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK AND HE WAS VERY VERY YOUNG. ANY TOLD ME A STORY AND HE SAID YOU KNOW I I WENT INTO THE RESTROOM AND MY SCHOOL. THE OTHER DAY AND I FOUND A YOUNG MAN. MY AGE SITTING ON THE FLOOR CRYING UNCONTROLLABLY. AND HE HE WAS DISTRAUGHT. AND THE STUDENT TOLD ME I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO BECAUSE THERE WERE NO THE COUNSELORS AT MY SCHOOL SITE THIS IS A SCHOOL IN THE DISTRICT. IN MY SCHOOL SITE. THERE WAS NO NURSE I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. SO I'M SURPRISED HE COULD SAY THIS BUT HE SAID I WONDER BEING THE THE COUNSELOR FOR THIS YOUNG MAN TO GET HIM. IN GOOD ENOUGH SHAPE TO GO BACK TO THE CLASSROOM TO TALK. TO OUR TEACHER. SO I GUESS MY QUESTION TO YOU ALL IS HOW DO YOU STAFF YOUR CAMPUSES YOUR SCHOOL SITES WITH RESPECT. TO TO MENTAL HEALTH. PROVIDERS OF ONE FLAVOR OR ANOTHER -- MAYBE I MISSED IT IN THE PRESENTATIONS AND IF I DID PERHAPS YOU CAN REMIND ME. HELLO IN PLASTER COUNTY IT VARIES AMONG SCHOOL SIZE DEPENDENT ON FUND AND AND STRATEGIES WHAT I SEE HAPPEN AND AND OUR COUNTY. IS DISTRICTS ADOPT AN INDIVIDUALS LIKE -- HEALTH PROVIDERS MF CHEESE OR LICENSED CLINICAL SOCIAL WORKERS TO THE SCHOOL SITES. SO I SAY AN INCREASE AND EVER INCREASING A RALPH FOR THOSE TYPES OF INDIVIDUAL SCHOOL COUNSELORS. AS WELL OR SCHOOL SOCIAL WORKERS BALUSTRADED VERY NICELY THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF PROVINCIAL PEOPLE SOME OF THEM ARE CLASSIFIED SOME OF THEM ARE CERTIFICATED. AND WHAT I'M SEEING ACROSS OUR COUNTY AND AND OTHER -- COUNTIES ACROSS THE STATE IS THOSE INDIVIDUALS ARE START INTO SINCE THE PASSAGE OF AB. ONE FOURTEEN WEEKS AND AN INCREASE OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS STARTED TO WORK AT SCHOOL SITES. I MEAN IS IT A LOCAL OPTION. IS THE COUNTY OFFICE GET INVOLVED TO THE DISTRICT OFFICES GET INVOLVED WHO DECIDES. WHO DECIDES WHO GOES WHERE WHAT METRICS DO YOU HAVE HOW DO YOU DETERMINE NEED WHAT ARE YOUR FUNDING SOURCES AND WHERE YOU'RE FUNDING SHORTFALLS YOU KNOW THAT? WITH RESPECT PROP COUNTY YOUR WRITTEN. A SOME COUNTIES HAVE DECIDED -- TO TO BANK THE MONEY -- LA COUNTY BEING NOTABLE RIVERSIDE COUNTY IS NO OF CHAMP ON THIS. AND NOT ROLL THE MONEY OUT TO PROVIDE BADLY NEEDED MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES INCLUDING MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AT OUR SCHOOLS. AND OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS SO. THAT'S A THEY TOLD US NOT TO ASK -- COMPOUND QUESTIONS IN LAW SCHOOL BUT THAT'S A COMPOUND QUESTION BUT PERHAPS IF YOU CAN REMEMBER THE VARIOUS COMPONENTS OF A BIG. ALL OF THOSE I WILL TRY TO GET MY POINT. AND I'D LIKE TO JUMP IN ON THAT AS WELL I DO VERY VERY WELL TAKE THE OTHER HALF OF THE COMPOUND THAT'S OF REAL UP RELATIVE -- TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT AND FUND AND IN THE LEGISLATION IT'S COMMUNITY TROFENSE SO WE SEE DIFFERENT PLANTS ACROSS THE STATE. THE OPPORTUNITY TO SIFAT FOR THIS DEMONSTRATION PROJECT WITH THE MENTAL HEALTH OVERSIGHT ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION I THINK IS REALLY CRITICAL. ARE YOU SAYING THAT. DID UNDER PROP. SIXTY THREE WHETHER THE MONEY IS DRIVEN TO SEE BE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS FOR PURPOSES OF ASSISTING SCHOOLS. OR DIRECTLY TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT WE'RE SOMEHOW PROHIBITED FROM USING THE PROP SIXTY THREE MONEY FOR THIS NO. NO NOT AT ALL WHAT I'M WHAT I'M REFERENCE IN IS COMMUNITIES HAVE ORGANIZED IT IN DIFFERENT WAYS. SAID THE SERVICES THAT WE'RE DESCRIBING ABOUT HAVING COMMUNITY WELLNESS CENTERS ON CAMPUS OR STAFF ON CAMPUS. IN SOME COUNTIES AS DRIVEN THROUGH MORE OF A CLINICAL MODEL WHERE STUDENTS WILL GO TO A CLINIC AND RECEIVE. THOSE SERVICES -- TO AN EXAMPLE MIGHT BE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF AN INCREDIBLE YEARS PROGRAM THAT'S SUPPORT AND YOUNG STUDENTS -- TYPICALLY CAVE THROUGH THIRD GRADE BUT THAT MIGHT NOT BE HAPPEN AND AT THE SCHOOL SITE. HOW HOW DOES THAT STUDENT IN? HOW'S THAT STUDENT IN IDENTIFIED. AND HOW DOES THE STUDENT GET TO THE CLINICAL SIDE [inaudible] IN SUCH. THE MOST TRAGIC IN CATASTROPHIC ONES WHERE WE HAVE A SUICIDAL STUDENT TOURS SOMEONE WHO'S AN EXTREME DISTRESS AND THAT'S THE OPPORTUNITY UNDER THIS SHIFT WHERE SAN SINCE AB. ONE FOURTEEN IS TO HELP SCHOOLS I UNDERSTAND THE TYPES OF INDIVIDUALS THAT WE NEED ON CAMPUS AND HOW DO PARTNER WITH OUR MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS. IN MOVE AND SO THE THE INSTANCE I GAVE IN PLASTER COUNTY. WE WORKING WITH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH UNDER THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT USE THOSE DOLLARS TO PLANTS INCREDIBLE YEARS PROGRAMS DIRECTLY ON A SCHOOL SITE CAMPUS. SO FOR PLASTER COUNTY WE TAKE THOSE PROGRAMS INCREDIBLE YEARS -- THINGS LIKE FUNCTIONAL FAMILY THERAPY AND WE CREATE A STRONGER AND ACCESS DIRECTLY TO THE SCHOOL SITE. AND I THINK WHAT I'M SAYING ACROSS THE STATE IS A SHIFT IN THAT DIRECTION. I WAS LIKE A LESSER COUNTY IS WILLING TO USE THE PROP SIXTY THREE MONEY. FOR THE PURPOSE ONE OF THE PURPOSES FOR WHICH IT WAS INTENDED TO ROLL MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OUT. TO INTO THE COMMUNITY INCLUDING INTO ART SCHOOL. YES YES VERY MUCH IN THE NOT SURE THAT'S THE CASE IN OTHER COUNTY I'M GONNA SUGGEST THAT. THAT IS NOT MY EXPERIENCE -- THAT WE WE HAVE NOT SEEN THOSE DOLLARS AND THAT'S WHY THERE'S A HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE MILLION OR HUNDRED THIRTY SIX BILLION IN THE AND THE ORIGIN -- IN THE IN A HOT YEAH. SO I WHAT WHAT WHAT WE'VE DONE IS WE'VE USED A PORTION OF OUR LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA DOLLARS THROUGH OUR LOCAL CONTROL AND ACCOUNTABILITY PLAN. TO FUND ADDITIONAL MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES THROUGH OUR EL CAP. AND WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE TODAY IS WE'VE HIRED -- WE HAVE EIGHTEEN MENTAL HEALTH IN EARNS. WHO ARE GUIDED BY A LICENSED MARRIAGE FAMILY COUNSELOR UNDER THEIR LICENSE AS THEY ARE LEARNING AND SO THESE ARE? INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE WORKING THROUGH THEIR PROGRAM. AND WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO STAFF ORDERS PAID THEY ARE PAID INTERNSHIPS SO SO IT'S SO. IT'S SOMEONE IS WORKING TOWARD A LICENSE CLINIC TOWARDS THEIR TOWARDS OUR FULL LICENSE AND WE WE WE PAY THEM. BASICALLY ENOUGH MONEY TO COVER THEIR GAS. IS HOW IT WORKS AND THAT AND THAT'S REALLY UNFORTUNATE BUT ON THE OTHER SIDE THE VALUE THAT THEY ADD. I JUST MET WITH OUR PRINCIPLES. THAT ARE TWELVE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SITES WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO STAFF. AT TWO POINT FIVE DAYS A WEEK AND THE VALUE THAT THEY'RE BRINGING TO OUR STUDENTS AND THE STAFF THE PRINCIPLE THAT TEACHERS AT THOSE SITES BY BY BEING ABLE. TO PROVIDE THERAPEUTIC SERVICES FOR OUR STUDENTS HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANT. THE DIFFERENCE THAT I SEE IS THAT OUR SCHOOL COUNSELORS WELL THEY ARE EXTREMELY VALUABLE. WE'RE MOVING INTO A SITUATION WHERE. WE REALLY NEED THE MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONAL WHO CAN PROVIDE NOT SIMPLY COUNSELING SERVICES BUT THERAPEUTIC SERVICES AND FOR US THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE. AND THE OTHER POINT I WOULD MAKE IS THAT. WELL WE DO HAVE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE THAT ARE THERE AND AVAILABLE TO PROVIDE THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. THAT IS NOT ACCESSIBLE IN ALL SCHOOL DISTRICTS. IN SO FOR EXAMPLE ONE OF MY SUPERINTENDENT COLLEAGUES HAS A SCHOOL DISTRICT OF THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY SIX STUDENTS. IN ORDER TO GET THIS THE STUDENT WHO IN NEEDS THERAPEUTIC SERVICES THEY HAVE TO TAKE A TWO HOUR BUS RIDE. UP FROM THE SCHOOL DISTRICT TO THE SERVICES AND BACK. IN SO MY THINKING IS THAT IF THE DOLLARS ARE MOVING MORE TOWARDS WHERE THE WHERE THE CHILDREN ARE LOCATED -- THE SERVICES CAN BE MORE ON DEMAND. HAVE YOU MADE AN ATTEMPT TO ACCESS THE PROP SIXTY THREE FUNDING THROUGH THE COUNTY PROCESS WE NOT TO MY KNOWLEDGE -- WE WE HAVE I WOULD SAY WE HAVE NOT. AND THEN LET ME I DON'T WANT TO CUT THIS DISCUSSION UP BECAUSE I THINK IT'S VALUABLE BUT I ALSO WANT. TO THROW ANOTHER QUESTION IN MY COLLEAGUES MAY HAVE SOME QUESTIONS. PERSONS IS THE MEDICAL REIMBURSEMENT PROCESS THAT UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES -- SCHOOL SCHOOL DISTRICTS CAN CONFIRM CAN I ASSUME COUNTY OFFICES CAN FOLLOW TO RECOUP SOME OF THE COST OF MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. HAVE YOU ATTEMPTED THAT AND HAVE THERE BEEN CHALLENGES IN DOING SO YES AND YES. SO OUR NORMAL SCHOOL COUNSELORS HAVE A P. P. S. C. CREDENTIALED PEOPLE PERSONAL SERVICES CREDENTIAL. THEY CANNOT BILL FOR MEDI CAL REIMBURSEMENT IN THEIR ROLE. AND AND THIS IS I'M BEING I'M BEING TOLD THIS BY I JUST MET WITH ALL OF MY FOLKS BEFORE. YOU KNOW ARRIVING HERE IN SACRAMENTO. AND SO ONE OF THE THINGS THEY'RE THEY'RE SUGGESTING IS SOME SORT OF A STATUTORY CHANGE THAT WILL ALLOW THEM TO BILL FOR DIRECT MEDI CAL SERVICES AS A SCHOOL COUNSELOR. NOW OUR MENTAL HEALTH THERAPISTS ARE SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGIST THEY CAN BUILD DIRECTLY. AND I I THAT THAT TO ME IS IS SOMETHING THAT THERE MAY BE A GAP -- FOR AND AND I THINK THIS IS WHAT YOU ALSO ALLUDED TO THAT THERE'S THERE'S DIFFERENT. LICENSING. AND CREDENTIALING AND WHAT THE LICENSING AND CREDENTIALED STAFF CAN DO AND BILL FOR IS NOT IN COHERENCE WITH ONE ANOTHER. WHICH DOESN'T NECESSARILY SUPPORT THE NEEDS OF THE STUDENT. I THINK IT'S VERY I MEAN I'M NOT A EDUCATOR AND I'M NOT A HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS CERTAINLY NOT A MENTAL HEALTH CARE PROVIDER BUT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT. THE THAT THE CORE OF ALL THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT TO HAVE SOME. POINT OF CONTACT ON A SCHOOL CAMPUS WHO CAN AT LEAST DO THE INITIAL -- WHO CONTACT TRIAGE AND IN APPROPRIATE CASES MOVE THIS IF THE STUDENT IS AN EXTREME SITUATION MOVE THEM TO A CLINICAL SETTING BUT IF NOT? ADDRESS SOME OF THE COMMENTS AND CONCERNS THAT WE THAT ARE REFLECTED IN THE NOTES -- THAT WERE PRESENTED IN THIS HANDOUT I THINK THAT'S WHY THIS PROJECT WAS SO PER PERFECT TO FALL UNDERNEATH THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICE ACT TRIAGE DOLLARS. THE OTHER PART OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO HELP DISTRICTS UNDERSTAND AND LEARN OURSELVES AND IMPROVE IN THIS PROCESS. IS THE IDEA OF RATED OR BLENDED FUND. SO WHILE CERTAIN STAFF CAN'T YOU KNOW THE THE LAW REQUIRES CERTAIN TYPES OF STAFF TO DO CERTAIN TYPES OF FELL IN THE NEXT SATURDAY IT'S A VERY COMPLICATED LAW ONE THING WE CAN DO IS MAKE. THOSE ROLES LESS COMPLICATED. YEAH UNTIL THEN HOW DO WE SUPPORT DISTRICTS AND UNDERSTAND AND ABRADED FUND AND MODEL. WHERE EVERYBODY CAN BRING THEIR FUNDING SOURCES TO TO THE TABLE PLASTERS THERE ON HAT IN SOME DEGREE I THINK MONTEREY COUNTY IS ALSO AND EXCELLENT EXAMPLE? WITH A AMY MILLER HER LEADERSHIP THAT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WORKING WITH ACCOUNTING OFFICE TO LOOK AT HOWEVER HOW CAN WE SPEND THESE DOLLARS. HOW CAN WE PUSH THEM INTO? GATHERS SO WE'VE BEEN TOGETHER LC -- FAST MEDI CAL EDUCATION MA RELATED MEDICO OPTIONS TOGETHER. TO MAYBE IN A NOT SHOW AND I KNOW YOU'VE COVERED THIS BUT HOW IS IT THAT YOU HAVE BEEN RELATIVELY SUCCESSFUL IF NOT VERY SUCCESSFUL. IN TAPPING INTO THE MIDDLE OF SERVICES ACT PROP. SIXTY THREE MONEY IS A BECAUSE YOU SAID ON THE LOCAL BOARD. PARTLY YES SO IN PLASTER COUNTY WE HAVE A MONTHLY. MEET AND A LOOK AT OUR OUR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IN THE COUNTY IT'S COMMUNITY COLLABORATIVE ME THEN. THAT COLLABORATIVE DRIVE SOME OF THE DECISION MAKING AROUND OR MENTAL HEALTH DOLLARS. ALSO I THINK BECAUSE WE HAVE A HISTORY OF AN INTEGRATED SYSTEM. PRIOR TO EDUCATION I USED TO BE THE ASSISTANT DIRECTOR FOR OUR SYSTEM OF CARE BEFORE MOVING TO THE COUNTY OFFICE. SO THE IDEA OF HAVE AND I SYSTEMS OF CARE MODEL. NOT AT THE COUNTY LEVEL OR THAT COLLABORATION EVEN AT THE STATE LEVEL BETWEEN DEPARTMENTS COULD RESOLVE SOME OF THE FUNDING NEEDS AND AND BARRIERS AT ARMS PLACE. OVER THAT COLLABORATION DOWN TO REGION ALL AND COUNTY LEVELS WHERE WE ME. EVERY OTHER WEDNESDAY AS I COUNTY LEADERSHIP GROUP TO LOOK AT ALL KINDS OF CHALLENGES FOR PLASTER COUNTY FROM CHILD WELFARE TO MENTAL HEALTH. THE FUNDING CHALLENGES PROBATION. OUR PROBATION DEPARTMENT FUNDS A SHORT TERM RESIDENTIAL THIRTY DAY. CRISIS CENTER OUT OF PREVENTION DAHLE. WHICH I THINK IS PRETTY UNHEARD OF AS WELL. SO THE IDEA OF OF BRING AND YOU PEOPLE USE THE METAPHOR OF YOUR YOUR TOYS TO THE SANDBOX OR PUTTING YOUR MONEY ALL THE MONEY ON THE TABLE AND YOUR HANDS BEHIND YOUR BACK AND HOW CAN WE SERVE OUR KIDS. IN A MORE -- LEADERSHIP MODEL OR DO LEADERSHIP DRIVEN MODEL -- IT TAKES SOME COURAGE FROM PEOPLE LIKE -- OUR DEPARTMENT HAS OR MONTEREY OR THE DESERT ITSELF I THINK IS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF HOW THEY'VE USED. FUND AND STRATEGIES. TO BILL MEDI CAL THROUGH THE SOUTH. IT SOUNDS LIKE THE THE THE EFFORT NEEDS TO START AT THE COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION AROUND THE STATE AND I IMAGINE IT'S PRETTY DIFFICULT FOR ONE SCHOOL DISTRICT OUT OF A BUNCH. TO GET FIGHT THE WAY TO THE TABLE AND STICK A HAND IN THE BUCKET GRAVEL BUNCH OF MONEY. SO WE REALLY NEED TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO DRIVE. BEST PRACTICES FROM -- ONE COE TO OTHERS AROUND THE STATE SO THAT WE HAVE A SOMEWHAT. RECOGNIZING THEIR DIFFERENCES WHAT'S YOUR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PARTNERS THERE WITH YOUR TO DRIVE DOWN JACK LEE. EXACTLY. THANK YOU SORRY THANKS FOR YOUR PATIENCE NO PROBLEM YOU HAD LOTS OF INTERESTING THINGS TO SAY RICHARD. SO I JUST WANT TO SAY HOW IMPORTANT I THINK THIS IS FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS I DID READ THROUGH ALL OF THE COMMENTS. TIMES ARE SO DIFFERENT NOW THAN WHEN HE MADE ANY OF US WENT TO SCHOOL AND I THINK THAT OUR YOUNG PEOPLE AND OUR CHILDREN ARE LIVING IN SITUATIONS. THAT NONE OF US CAN ALWAYS IMAGINE SO I THINK THIS THIS IS HELPFUL FOR A COUPLE REASONS. ONE EVEN OUR TEACHERS PROBABLY DON'T UNDERSTAND EXACTLY BECOME RATED TEACH EVERY DAY AND RAY TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE DOING WHAT THEY NEED TO DO. BUT THEY MAY NOT REALIZE FULLY WITH THEIR STUDENTS ARE LIVING AT HOME. BUT I ALSO THINK THIS IS A GOOD AVENUE FOR STUDENTS TO BE ABLE TO START EXPRESSING THEMSELVES AND MAY BE STARTING TO REALIZE THAT BY EXPRESSING WHAT'S GOING ON THEY CAN ACTUALLY ASK FOR HELP. SO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS AND I HOPE WE CAN CONTINUE TO DO THINGS LIKE THIS. SECONDLY -- YOU KNOW I WOULD SAY A BIT -- SUBMIT THAT. MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS ON CAMPUS IS REALLY AN EUITY ISSUE. IF WE HAVE. SCHOOL DISTRICT ALL DOING DIFFERENT THINGS BASED ON HOW THEY SPEND THEIR EL CAP BASED ON IF THEY CAN PULL DOWN MONEY FROM PROP. SIXTY THREE I WOULD SAY -- THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE REALLY DOESN'T WANT TO HEAR THIS BUT I THINK WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING AS A STATE TO MAKE SURE EVERY CAMPUS IN EVERY SCHOOL. ARE IN EVERY DISTRICT HAS A MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDER BECAUSE IF WE DON'T DO THAT. I DON'T KNOW HOW I FEEL LIKE THAT WE JUST HAVE THIS PATCHWORK THAT WE KEEP DOING AND YOU KNOW WE'VE GOT ONE SCHOOL OVER HERE OR SCHOOL DISTRICT YOU'RE WHO SAYS. THIS IS OUR PRIORITY SO THESE KIDS HAVE ACCESS TO IT THE SCHOOL DISTRICT SAYS WELL THIS IS OUR PRIORITY BUT WHAT'S HAPPENING TO THOSE KIDS SO. I THINK WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR WHAT ALL OF YOU WERE DOING BUT I THINK WE NEED TO DO MORE AT THE STATE LEVEL TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS IS THIS EQUITY ISSUES ADDRESS FOR ALL OF OUR STUDENTS I THINK IT'S ESPECIALLY SO WITH A VERY SMALL ROOM GET DISTRICTS BECAUSE IT. ISN'T IT IT YOU KNOW HAVING RELATIONSHIPS IS VERY IMPORTANT SO THAT YOU CAN GET SOME OF THOSE SERVICES BUT ALSO THE GEOGRAPHICAL DISTANCE WHERE. YOU MAY HAVE THE FUNDING SOURCES BUT YOU DON'T HAVE THE HUMAN RESOURCES THE PERSON THAT WILL COME OUT AND WE LIVE IT EVEN TALKED WHEN I TALK TO THE WELL. WEBSITE HEALTH CARE DISTRICT WE EVEN TALKED ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF TELEMEDICINE YOU KNOW WHERE IS A STUDENT WOULD CALL IN AND THEY'RE TALKING TO A PROFESSIONAL BECAUSE THE PROBLEM FOR US TONIGHT I THINK WE WOULD ALL SAY THIS IS. WE ARE NOT MENTAL HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS WE'RE NOT AND SO WHEN A STUDENT WHO IS IN CRISIS COMES TO US WE ARE DOING THE ABSOLUTE BEST THAT WE CAN AND WE'RE MAKING DECISIONS AND TRYING TO CONNECT THEM. TO SOMETIMES STRUCTURES THAT DON'T YET EXIST RIGHT AND SO I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT AS WE THINK OF THE MANY SMALL RURAL DISTRICTS THAT ARE OUT THERE IS HOW DO WE SUPPORT. THEM AND MAKE THAT POSSIBLE FOR THEIR STUDENTS WHERE IT'S NOT BASED ON GEOGRAPHY. TOTALLY AGREE I THINK WE NEED TO USE ALL THE TOOLS IN OUR TOOLBOX AND IF TELEHEALTH TELEMEDICINE IF THAT WORKS BETTER. IT'S A EIGHT A GREAT THING TO USE I'M ALWAYS A FAN OF SOMEONE LOOKING SOMEONE IN THE EYE AND BEING RIGHT THERE. IT DOESN'T ALWAYS WORK THAT WAY SO THAT TO BE CREATIVE -- BUT I JUST THINK THAT WE CAN DO BETTER BY OUR YOUNG PEOPLE THEY REALLY ARE. WE NEED TO PUT THE MONEY WHERE OUR MOUTH IS THANK GOODNESS AND I THINK YOU KNOW WE WE AS DISTRICTS I MEAN WE HAVE DISTRICT PSYCHOLOGISTS BUT ONE OF THE CHALLENGES WITH THEIR ROLE. IS OFTENTIMES THEY'RE DOING THE EDUCATIONALIST SUSSMAN'S FOR THE INDIVIDUALIZED EDUCATION UP PLANS. AND THAT'S THAT'S KIND OF A STATUTORY REQUIREMENT RIGHT THEY HAVE TO DO THAT THEIR SPECIFIC TIME LINES. IS OFTEN TIMES YOU KNOW THE THE PERSON WHO'S KIND OF VIEWING FROM THE OUTSIDE OF THE SYSTEM MIGHT SAY WELL THEY HAVE A SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGIST. WITH THE ROLE THAT THEY'RE IAN WE WE REALLY NEED -- THE PROFESSIONALS WHO CAN FOCUS ON PROVIDING THE THERAPEUTIC MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND THAT'S WHAT THEY DO THAT'S THEIR SPECIALTY AND AND TO MAKE THOSE SERVICES AVAILABLE ON DEMAND AND IN AN EQUITABLE WAY. SO THAT WE'RE GEARING TEAM. THAT EVERY STUDENT WHO NEEDS IT HAS ACCESS. AND AND BY THE WAY THE FAMILY THAT'S ATTACHED TO THAT STUDENT. NUMBER DIFFERENT. TO THE HAS DIFFERENT SKILLS ALWAYS IN. AND I AGREE I HAVE A COUPLE FRIENDS WHO ARE SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGISTS AND THEY SPEND ABOUT 80% OF THEIR TIME TO THE I. E. PEAS AND THE PAPERWORK WHICH IS GREAT IT'S MANDATED THAT'S OUR JOB. BUT TO ONLY HAVE 20% OF THEIR TIME LEFT OVER TO ACTUALLY COUNSEL AND MAYBE THEY CAN DO THAT THEY CAN DO THE I EP IS A WHAT NOT AND WE HAVE A MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDER IT'S RIGHT THERE WITH THEM IS COMING AND I JUST I WANTED THIS OUT. I WANT TO JUST MAKE SURE I GOT THIS RIGHT BECAUSE MY FOLKS BACK HOME I WOULD JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE I'M I'M GIVING. SO THAT THE ONE RECOMMENDATION IS ALLOW SCHOOL BASED THERAPIST WITH OUT A PUPIL PERSONNEL SERVICES CREDENTIAL. TO MEDI CAL BILL. AND SO I THINK I HAD IT REVERSED IN THE FIRST TIME I PRESENTED IT SO I JUST WANTED TO MAKE THAT CORRECTION. WE'RE WORKING ON SO ACCESS SUPERINTENDENT WHILE I HAVE YOU. HAVE YOU DONE A CALCULATION. TO DETERMINE HOW MUCH ADDITIONAL. OF FUNDING YOU WOULD NEED IN ORDER TO STAFF YOUR THE SCHOOLS WITHIN YOUR DISTRICT APPROPRIATELY FOR PURPOSES OF PROVIDING MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES TO YOUR STUDENT POPULATION. I HAVE NOT QUANTIFIED THAT I COULD BE INTERESTING I COULD DO THAT AND I'D BE HAPPY TO GET THAT TO POLICE. INTERESTING TO KNOW WHAT THE DEL IS YES. AND DOCTOR HAVE YOU BEEN ABLE -- TO THROUGH YOUR COUNTY OFFICE BEEN ABLE TO ACCESS PROP SIXTY THREE FUNDING FOR WE HAVE NOT WE HAVE NOT. THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT. DOESN'T WITH MY KNOCKING ON THAT DOOR AS A SURPRISE ME WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO FIGURE TWO EXAMPLES WHERE IT TO FIGURE THIS OUT -- AT SOME POINT ANYTHING ELSE. I JUST WANT TO SAY HOW MUCH I'VE APPRECIATED THE CONVERSATION I LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING. MORE OF IT THIS IS A VERY HIGH PRIORITY FOR OF MEMBERS OF THE OF OUR CAUCUS IN THE SENATE. WE INTEND TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON IT THIS YEAR AND IN THE YEARS IN THE FUTURE IN PARTICULAR TO TRY TO FIX THE REGULATORY ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH. MEDI CAL BILLING. OUTSTANDING THANK YOU SO MUCH MISS CHAIRMAN. GET THE NEXT ITEM IS ITEM SIXTY THREE SIXTY COMMISSION ON TEACHER CREDENTIALING ISSUE NUMBER. FOUR COMMISSION ON TEACHER CREDENTIALING BUDGET PROPOSALS.

ARE WE HAVE THREE PRIMARY FUNCTIONS OF THE COMMISSION FIRST IS THAT WE SET STANDARDS FOR THE PREPARATION OF THE EDUCATIONAL WORKFORCE. WE ARE CREDIT ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY ENTITIES THAT PREPARE THAT WORK FORCE. WE ISSUE CREDENTIALS TO PEOPLE WHO EARN THEM AND ARE QUALIFIED FOR THEM. AND WE ENGAGE AN EDUCATOR DISCIPLINE ARE WHEN THERE ARE CASES OF MISCONDUCT. ON THE LAST EIGHT YEARS WE'VE HAD THE GREAT GOOD PLEASURE OF WORKING WITH DR LINDA DARLING HAMMOND AS OUR CHAIR. SHE OF COURSE IS MOVED TO THE STATE BOARD OF PRESIDENCY AND WE HAVE A NEW CHAIR OF OF THE COMMISSION. DR TINA SLOAN FROM UC SANTA BARBARA. US SO THAT'S A BIG SHIFT FOR US -- BUT ALL ALL FOR THE GOOD OF THE LAST EIGHT YEARS WE'VE DONE A LOT OF OVERHAULING OF WORK BRINGING ALL OF OUR STANDARDS FOR TEACHERS FOR SPECIAL EDUCATORS FOR ADMINISTRATORS. FOR SCHOOL COUNSELORS AND SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGISTS AND SCHOOL SOCIAL WORKERS TO PERTINENT TO YOUR LAST PANEL. UP TO DATE -- WE'VE ADOPTED NEW STANDARDS FOR ALL OF THOSE TYPES OF EDUCATORS WHICH HAS BEEN IMPORTANT WORK BRINGING THAT INTO ALIGNMENT. WITH THE STATE'S -- EXPECTATIONS FOR SERVICE TO STUDENTS -- WE'VE ALSO DEVELOP PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENTS FOR TEACHERS AND FOR ADMINISTRATORS WHICH IS REALLY IMPORTANT WORK WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK. ON A SPECIAL EDUCATION FORM OF THAT WE'VE OVER HOLDER ACCREDITATION SYSTEM AND WE'VE BEEN PLEASED TO SERVE -- AS THE VEHICLE FOR GETTING A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN GRANT FUNDING OUT TO LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO SUPPORT TEACHER SHORTAGES SO. I KNOW THAT'S A TOPIC FOR A SECOND PANEL THAT I'D LOVE TO BE PARTOF LET ME JUST WRAP UP BY YOU SAYING WE SUPPORT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION. HELLO. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR ANYWAY WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE I'LL BE SPEAKING SPECIFICALLY TO THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IN THE SPECIAL EDUCATION I TEACHING PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT. SO YOU SHOULD HAVE RECEIVED A HANDOUT THAT I'LL BE SPEAKING FROM DURING MY PRESENTATION THIS AFTERNOON. THE ISSUE BEFORE YOU IS WHETHER TO ADOPT A NEW ASSESSMENT INTENDED TO MEASURE WHETHER PROSPECTIVE TEACHERS SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHERS ARE PREPARED TO ENTER THE CLASSROOM. THIS ASSESSMENT IS KNOWN AS THE TEACHING PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT OR THE DPA. THE STARTING ON PAGE ONE BY WAY OF BACKGROUND THE TP A IS A PORTFOLIO BASED EXERCISE THAT ASKS PERSPECTIVE TEACHERS TO DEMONSTRATE THE SKILLS AND KNOWLEDGE EXPECTED OF BEGINNING TEACHERS. THESE TASKS MAY INCLUDE PREPARING LESSON PLANS ASSESSING STUDENT LEARNING AND REFLECTING ON PASS INSTRUCTION ASSESSMENT IS INTEGRATED INTO THE TEACHER PREPARATION PROGRAMS AND SO PERSPECTIVE TEACHERS COMPLETE THE T. PAY. ALONGSIDE THEIR COURSE WORK. AND THEN THE PROSPECTIVE TEACHERS SUBMITS A PORTFOLIO OF WRITTEN AND VIDEO RECORDED WORK FOR AN INDEPENDENT ASSESSOR TO THEN SCORE. THE STATE HAS REQUIRED GENERAL EDUCATION TEACHERS TO PASS EIGHTY P. A TOP TEN THEIR TEACHING CREDENTIALS SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT THE LEGISLATURE ORIGINALLY INTENDED THIS TO IMPROVE TEACHER PREPARATION. BY -- STANDARDIZING AND BY ESTABLISHING CONSISTENCY IN TEACHING ASSESSMENT. CREATION PROGRAMS. NOW IN CONTRAST TO GENERAL EDUCATE. STATUTES SEIZE SILENT ON WHETHER SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHERS ARE REQUIRED TO TAKE A TP A TOP TEAM THE CREDENTIAL. RATHER STATUE GIVE CDC THE BROAD DISCRETION OVER ASSESSMENT REQUIREMENTS FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHERS AND CURRENTLY CTC DOES NOT REQUIRE SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHERS TO PASS. YEAH. MOVING ON TO THE NEXT PAGE. HERE WE DISCUSS THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL THE GOVERNOR. BUDGET PROVIDES ONE POINT TWO MILLION IN ONE TIME FUNDING FOR THE CCC TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT EIGHTY K. FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION. THIS FUNDING WOULD COME FROM THE TEST DEVELOPMENT AND ADMINISTRATION ACCOUNT THIS IS A SPECIAL FUNDS THAT COLLECTS REVENUES FROM FEES PAID. BY PROSPECTIVE TEACHERS WHEN THEY TAKE THE STATE REQUIRED ASSESSMENTS. CDC ESTIMATES THE TOTAL COST TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT THE SPECIAL EDUCATION TO PA TO BE TWO MILLION AND INTENSE ACROSS THE REMAINING OF OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS. CDC ANTICIPATES A FOR YOUR TIMELINE TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT THE SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHER HEY. THIS YEAR C. D. C. WOULD ENTER INTO A CONTRACT WITH A TEST DEVELOPER TO START DEVELOPMENT THEN THE NEXT TWO YEARS SPELL START PILING THE TASK TO THEIR FIELD TESTS. AND THEN BEGINNING TWENTY TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE AND USE A NEW -- NEW SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHERS WITH THEM YOU'RE REQUIRED TO TAKE THE CPA TYPE TEAM OR TEACHING CREDENTIAL. AND CDC INTENSE THE COST OF THE SPECIAL EDUCATION GPA TO BE COMPARABLE TO THE EXISTING DPA TO BE A WHICH IS CURRENTLY THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS PER TEST TAKER. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ALSO PROVIDES ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY SIX THOUSAND ON GOING FROM THE TEST DEVELOPMENT AND ADMINISTRATION ACCOUNT FOR ONE NEW FULL TIME POSITION TO SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SPECIAL EDUCATION PTA. MOVING ON TO THE NEXT PAGE. WE BELIEVE THE SPECIAL EDUCATION TO PA COMES WITH SOME STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS WE'LL START WITH A PROPOSAL STRENGTH. FIRST A SPECIAL EDUCATION TP A COULD BETTER PREPARE NEW TEACHERS TO ENTER THE CLASSROOM BY ASSESSING WHETHER OR NOT THEY HAVE EXPECTED. KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS TO PROVIDE INSTRUCTION TO STUDENTS WITH SPECIAL NEEDS THIS MAY INCLUDES. MANAGING CASES AND HER PARENTS ABOUT VISUALIZE -- EDUCATION PROGRAMS. ALTHOUGH THE EXISTING RESEARCH IS LIMITED WE DID FIND THREE STUDIES THAT JENNER ART THAT WERE GENERALLY SUPPORTIVE. OF THE CONNECTION BETWEEN HOW IT TEACHER PERFORMS ANA TKA AND ASSOCIATED IMPROVEMENTS IN STUDENT ACADEMIC OUTCOMES. SECOND EIGHTY PA COULD IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF TEACHER PREPARATION PROGRAMS FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION. CITY SEE INTENDS TO ANALYZE THE RESULTS FROM THE SPECIAL EDUCATION T. PA AND AND USE THAT INFORMATION TO INFORM WHETHER OR NOT TO IMPROVE PREPARATION PROGRAMS. WHETHER TO APPROVE THEM DURING THAT CREATION PROCESS. THIS DATA ANALYSIS WOULD ALSO HELP CDC IDENTIFY THE RELATIVE STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES OF EACH PROBE. LASTLY WE CONSIDER THE PROJECT COST AND FUN SOURCE TO BE REASONABLE. CITY SEIZE COST ESTIMATE FOR THE SPECIAL EDUCATION T. PAY REFLECTS SOME SAVINGS FROM THE RE PURPOSING OF COMPONENTS OF THE GENERAL EDUCATION GPA. IN OTHER WORDS CITY SEE WOULD NOT BE STARTING FROM SCRATCH WHEN DEVELOPING THE SPECIAL EDUCATION TVA. ADDITIONALLY THE PROPOSED FUND SOURCE IS IF THE CIVIC WE INTENDED FOR THE DEVELOPMENT AND ADMINISTRATION OF TAX. THE SPECIAL FUND HAS BEEN GROWING IN THE RECENT YEARS AND IS LIKELY ABLE TO SUPPORT THE PROPOSAL'S. MOVING ON TO THE NEXT PAGE. HERE WE DISCUSS TO POTENTIAL DOWNSIDES WITH THE PROPOSAL'S. FIRST WHEN WE SPOKE TO GENERAL EDUCATION TEACHERS WHO COMPLETED THE EXISTING T. PA. WE CONSIDER THE T. PAY TO BE A RATHER TIME INTENSIVE EXERCISE. THEY WERE CONCERNED ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF TIME IT TOOK RELATIVE TO HOW HELPFUL THEY FOUND IT AS A PREPARATION TOOL AND THIS IS ESPECIALLY COMPARED TO OTHER COMPONENTS OF TEACHING PREPARATION SUCH AS COURSE WORK. AND STUDENT TEACHING. LASTLY WE ARE UNCERTAIN ABOUT THE POTENTIAL IMPACT THAT A SPECIAL EDUCATION T. PAY MIGHT HAVE ON TEACHER SUPPLY. AS YOU KNOW THE STATE FACES A CHRONIC SHORTAGE OF SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHERS WHICH WILL SPEAK MORE ABOUT IN THE NEXT PANEL. BUT TO MEET THE DEMANDS FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHERS MANY SCHOOL DISTRICTS RSORT TO YOU OUR STATE RECRUITMENT OR HIRE STAFF WHO DO NOT MEET ALL CREDENTIAL REQUIREMENTS. IN NEW TO PAY REQUIREMENT WHAT OUT OF WORK AND COST TO THE PROCESS OF BECOMING A SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHER. ALTHOUGH THE ADDITION OF A T. PA MIGHT SEEM MODEST IN THE CONTEXT OF ALL THE OTHER REQUIREMENTS WE HAVE FOR NEW TEACHERS. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SOME OF THE SOME OF THIS SOME OF THE REQUIREMENTS COULD AFFECT THE NUMBER OF PROSPECTIVE TEACHERS THAT ARE INTERESTED IN AND ULTIMATELY UP TINA SPECIAL EDUCATION CREDENTIAL. MOVING ON TO THE LAST PAGE. WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE ADOPTS THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO FUND THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SPECIAL EDUCATION TO PA AND AT ONE NEW POSITION TO CDC. WE RECOGNIZE THAT THERE ARE SOME TRADE OFFS BUT ON BALANCE WE THINK THE PROPOSAL'S COULD HELP IMPROVE TEACHER PREPARATION AND BRING SPECIAL EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS IN LINE WITH THE ONES THAT THE STATE HAS FOR GENERAL EDUCATION. HOWEVER WE RECOMMENDS THE LEGISLATURE REQUIRE CDC TO ASSESS AND REPORT HOW THE SPECIAL EDUCATION T. PA WHAT MAY AFFECT TEACHER SUPPLY BY JANUARY. TWENTY TWENTY TWO WHICH IS WHEN THIS REQUIREMENT WOULD BE IMPLEMENTED. CDC COULD COLLECT INFORMATION DURING THE PILOT PHASE OF IMPLEMENTATION REGARDING QUAN% HOW THE T. PAY IS AFFECTING INTEREST IN SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHER PREPARATION PROGRAMS. TO HOW MUCH TIME IT TAKES TO COMPLETE THE DPA AND HOW THIS AFFECTS THE OVERALL WORKLOAD. AND THREE WHAT PERSPECTIVE TEACHERS CONSIDER THE ADDED VALUE OF THE T. PAY AND BETTER PREPARING THEM FOR THE CLASSROOM. THE LEGISLATURE CAN THEN USE THIS INFORMATION TO EVALUATE WHETHER A SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACH PA COULD AFFECT INTEREST WORKLOAD AND COMPLETION RATES IN THESE PROGRAMS. LASTLY IF THE LEGISLATURE IS INTERESTED IN LEARNING MORE ABOUT THE IMPACT OF THE T. P. AND STUDENT OUTCOMES WERE GENERALLY IT COULD FIND AN INDEPENDENT EVALUATION. THIS WOULD HELP INFORM WHETHER REQUIRING GENERAL AND IN SPECIAL ED TEACHERS TAKE A GPA ACHIEVES THE ACTUAL GOALS OF IMPROVING TEACHER PREPARATION AND STUDENT OUTCOMES. THIS CONCLUDES MY REMARKS AND I WOULD BE HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU. WELL JUST A COUPLE COMMENTS -- YOU KNOW IT OCCURS TO ME THAT IF THE TP A IS. AS VALUE FOR GENERAL EDUCATION TEACHERS I DON'T KNOW WHY WE WOULDN'T DO WITH DOING THAT FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHERS -- BUT I THINK THE OVERRIDING QUESTION WHICH MAYBE IS YET TO BE ANSWERED. IS GIVEN THE TEACHER RECRUITING ISSUES. GIVEN THE SHORTAGE OF SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHERS. HAS THERE BEEN ANY VALUE ASSESSMENT OF THE T. P. A. IN GENERAL WITH RESPECT SPEC TO THE GENERAL. EDUCATION. TEACHER POPULATION. OF AND HAS THAT WHEN WAS THAT ASSESSMENT AND WHAT WERE THE RESULTS AND IF NOT. PERHAPS IN ADDITION TO DOING THE ASSESSMENT. FOR OF THE SPECIAL ED -- SEGMENT IS THAT THIS RULES OUT MAYBE THE ASSESSMENT SHOULD BE APPLIED TO THE GENERAL CHECK. POPULATIONS WELL DR I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER OF THOSE QUESTIONS SO THAT WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH TEACHING PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENTS FOR THE GENERAL POPULATION. FOR FIFTEEN YEARS. ARMS AND SO WE'VE LEARNED A GREAT DEAL ABOUT HOW TO DO THIS AND AND HOW THEY BEST SUPPORT AND STRENGTH IN THE PREPARATION. OF TEACHERS WITHOUT OVER BURDENING THEM WITH MEANINGLESS TASKS THIS IS NOT YOUR AVERAGE TEST WHAT WITH THIS ASSESSMENT DOES IS IT IT ORGANIZES THEIR STUDENT TEACHING EXPERIENCE WITH SOME VERY SPECIFIC CONCRETE TASKS AROUND PLANNING INSTRUCTION. ADAPTING INSTRUCTION TO THE LEARNERS THEIR TEACHING ASSESSING INSTRUCTION DETERMINING WHO'S LEARNING WHAT THEY NEED TO DO NEXT INSTRUCTION ONLY IT'S VERY DEEPLY. AND IT OCCURS COMPLETELY WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF STUDENT TEACHING SO IT'S NOT AN ADDED REQUIREMENT IT IS AN ORGANIZER IF YOU WILL OR THAT PART OF THE EXPERIENCE. WE HAVE NOT FOUND THAT IT IS A HINDRANCE TO RECRUITMENT IN THE JANET SPACE -- AND WE'RE NOT EXPECTING IT TO BE IN THE SPECIAL EDUCATION -- WORLD EITHER. ESSENTIALLY IT'S OUR IT'S OUR EXPERIENCE THAT WHEN CANDIDATES APPLY TO ENTER INTO TEACHER PREPARATION REGARDLESS OF THE CREDENTIAL THEY'RE SEEKING. ACCEPT THE CONDITIONS OF THAT PREPARATION. AND THEY THEY AREN'T PARTICULARLY DISCRIMINATING AT THE POINT OF APPLICATION SHOULD I GO IN SHOULD I NOT GO IN -- THERE'S A BIG TEST I MIGHT NOT THAT'S NOT WITH THINKING THEY'RE THINKING I'D LIKE TO BE A SPECIAL ED TEACHER WHERE'S THE BEST PLACE FOR ME TO GO AND HOW DO I GET THIS DONE AND IT OCCURS WITHIN THE IN THE IN THE FRAMEWORK OF THEIR STUDENT TEACHER. THAT'S CORRECT AND AND WHAT WHAT HAPPENS TO THE AFTER YOU TAKE YOUR TP A IS -- IS -- FEEDBACK IS THAT WHAT HAPPENED YES SO IT'S USED AS A TOOL TO THEN PROVIDE FEEDBACK TO THE TO THE PROSPECTIVE TEACHERS WHAT THEY NEED TO DO AND WHAT THEY NEED TO BETTER MULTI FACETED FEEDBACK. THE THE ASSESSMENTS AS WE'VE DESIGNED OF THEM NOW HAVE. OF DIAGNOSTIC RUBRICS WHERE THEY GET FEEDBACK ON IT FOR JANET TEACHERS I THINK IT'S EIGHTEEN OR SO DIFFERENT DIMENSIONS OF THEIR TEACHING. THEY GET A SPECIFIC SCORE -- AND ITS USE THEY USE THOSE THAT FEEDBACK TO DESIGN THEIR INDIVIDUALIZED INDUCTION PLANS WHEN THEY BEGIN EMPLOYMENT THEY GO INTO AN INDUCTION PROGRAM. SO THIS BECOMES AWARE WERE MY STRINGS WERE MY WEAKNESSES HOW WHAT'S NEXT FOR ME AND DEVELOPMENT SO THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT PART OF THIS ITS FORMATIVE IN THAT WAY. BUT IT ALSO IS THE ACCREDITING BODY TELLS US A LOT ABOUT HOW PREPARATION IS WORKING IF ALL OF THE CANDIDATES ARE STRUGGLING WITH LET'S SAY ADOPTING INSTRUCTION TO SPECIAL ED KIDS. THEN WE KNOW WHAT TO WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR WHEN WE GO IN AND A CREDIT WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO SEE WHAT PATTERNS OF PERFORMANCE LOOK LIKE AND IT'S EXTREMELY HELPFUL IN THAT REGARD -- SO WE USE IT FOR ACCREDITATION PURPOSES FAQ MULTI IN THESE PROGRAMS USE IT SO THEY CAN GAUGE WHERE ARE WE HITTING THE MARK WHERE WE MISSING IT WITH OUR CANDIDATES WHERE DO WE NEED TO STRENGTHEN. SO THIS IS A TOOL THAT GIVES US CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT ACROSS ALL SECTORS STATE PROGRAM AND CANDIDATE. SO EXCELLENT EXCELLENT RESPONSE THANK YOU. ANYTHING FURTHER. WE'RE GONNA HOLD THIS ITEM OPEN WE WILL BE REVISITING AT NEXT WEEK. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ABSOLUTE YOU MAKE YOUR FLIGHT RIGHTWELL I THINK I'M GONNA STAY FOR THE NEXT PANEL BERMAN NAY. BUT PLEASE FORGIVE ME IF I DO HAVE TO LEAVE IF THIS GOES LONGER THAN I FIGHT MY COLLEAGUE MICHELLE PAROLED WILL TAKE OVER FOR ME. WE APPRECIATE YOU STAYING AS LONG AS YOU CAN YOU CAN. SO SO YOU'RE ASKED TO QUESTIONS IN THIS REPORT WE'VE HAD WE'VE HAD CHRONIC TEACHER SHORTAGES FOLLOWING A PERIOD OF TIME WHEN WE LAID OFF TEACHERS. AND HAD OF A SURPLUS AND THAT WAS DUE TO ECONOMIC DOWNTURN. OF WE VERY QUICKLY AS ECONOMIC RECOVERY OCCURRED SHORTAGES ACROSS THE STATE BEGAN TO OCCUR I WOULD SAY THAT IN SPECIAL EDUCATION SHORTAGES WERE CHRONIC AND OF MAINTAINED EVEN THROUGH ECONOMIC DOWNTURN. THE NEED FOR SPECIAL ED TEACHERS HAS BEEN GREAT AS WAS STEM IN OTHER FIELDS. ON SO IN RECENT YEARS THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS THE LEGISLATURE HAS PROVIDED THROUGH A SERIES OF PROGRAMS A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. IN GRANT FUNDING TO RECRUIT PREPARE OR PLACE SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHERS AND OTHER TEACHERS. ARE. AND THAT'S WE'RE LOOKING AT THAT THAT AFFECTING THE LIKE THE NEXT FIVE YEARS TO TAKE TO FULLY ROLL THIS OUT AND SEE WHAT THE YIELD WILL BE FROM THAT INVESTMENT. SO ONE AND I THINK WE HAD A HANDOUT THAT YOU PROBABLY HAVE. A YOU MAY HAVE AND IN FRONT OF YOU. YES THAT WOULD BE IT -- SO IN A WALK YOU QUICKLY THROUGH THESE PROGRAMS THE FIRST PROGRAM I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT IS THE CLASSIFIED TEACHER GRANT PROGRAM THIS IS A GRANT TO RECRUIT CLASSIFIED STAFF IN THE SCHOOLS. WHO HAVE AT LEAST IN A A LEVEL OF OF A DEGREE ATTAINMENT TO COMPLETE A BACCALAUREATE DEGREE IN A CREDENTIAL -- THAT'S BEEN A VERY SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM FOR US WE'VE SEEN FORTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS INVESTED IN IT OVER TWO CYCLES. OF THE FIRST COHORT OF A THOUSAND CLASSIFIED STAFF -- WERE FUNDED IN TWENTY SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN AND FIFTY OF THEM HOWEVER AND THEIR CREDENTIAL THEY HAD A LOT OF THEIR COURSE RECORDED COMPLETED THEIR THE LOW HANGING FRUIT IF YOU WILL. OF THE SECOND COHORT WAS FUNDED IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN TWENTY FIVE OF THEM HAVE EARNED THEIR CREDENTIALS IN THEIR TWELVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY CANDIDATES IN THAT POOL. SO THIS PROGRAM IS JUST STARTING -- TO TO GET GROUNDING AND MAKE MAKE -- MAKE TRACTION FOR US A BIT OVER THE OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS WE EXPECT TO SEE AT LEAST FIVE THOUSAND TEACHERS COME THROUGH -- NO IT'S NOT THAT'S ABOUT TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED TEACHERS COME THROUGH THAT PROGRAM AND GET CREDENTIALED. WITH INTEGRATED PROGRAMS THIS WAS SAID THIS IS AN INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT OF TEN MILLION DOLLARS IN HIGHER EDUCATION TO CREATE NEW. UNDERGRADUATE COMPLETE A BULL PROGRAMS WERE TEACHER COULD GET pIN FOUR YEARS THEY'RE GOING FOR SPECIAL LET IT WOULD BE FOUR AND A HALF YEARS. SO THESE GRANTS WERE FOR TWO YEARS FOR PROGRAMS TO DESIGN THIS THIS POT THIS PATHWAY. THEY'VE BEGUN IN ROLLING A CANDIDATES JUST THIS YEAR -- IN SPECIAL EDUCATION WE HAD TWENTY SEVEN PROGRAMS THAT ERE DEVELOPED OUT OF A TOTAL OF FORTY ONE THAT THE GRANT OF SUPPORTED ACROSS ALL CONTENT AREAS. FIVE HUNDRED SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHERS WERE ARE PROJECTED TO BE ENROLLED THIS YEAR AND WE WOULD EXPECT BECAUSE THIS IS INFRASTRUCTURE REBUILDING INFRASTRUCTURE THIS WILL BECOME A PATHWAY. THAT WE HOPE IS POPULAR AND DRAWS YOUNGER FRESHMAN INTO A PATHWAY THAT GETS THEM A TEACHING CREDENTIAL QUICKLY AT THE SAME TIME THAT THEY GET THEIR DEGREES. SOME OF US WERE SURPRISED TO LEARN THAT. THAT THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN THE TYPICALLY YOU GO YOU GO GET YOUR FOR YOUR DEGREE. EITHER IN AND EDUCATE AND PROFESSIONAL EDUCATION OR IN THE SUBJECT MATTER. AND THEN YOU GO BACK TO SCHOOL RIGHT EITHER IN THE SAME INSTITUTION OR SOME OTHER INSTITUTION FOR IS IT A ONE HELLO IS USUALLY A ONE YEAR PROGRAM OR WHEN YOU'RE PLUS OF SUMMER. OR TWO SUMMERS SO WE HAVE BEEN A POST BACCALAUREATE PREPARING STATE FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS FOR TO FOUR THIRTY FORTY ACRES THAT SAME ACROSS THE COUNTRY THERE ARE THAT'S IT'S IN USE THAT SO CERTAINLY THAT IS THE WAY THE PEOPLE GET CREDENTIALS BUT THE EDUCATION MAJOR. IS IN MUCH GREATER USE ACROSS THE COUNTRY THEN IT HAS BEEN IN CALIFORNIA PARTLY BECAUSE THE LEGISLATURE DISALLOWED AN EDUCATION MAJOR IN LIKE. NINETEEN SEVENTY ONLY RECENTLY IN THE LAST FEW YEARS HAS THE RESTRICTION AGAINST HAVING A PROFESSED A DEGREE IN EDUCATION BEEN LIFTED. BY THE LEGISLATURE SO. THIS EIGHT IT'S OPENED UP OPPORTUNITY IN CALIFORNIA THAT WE ARE VERY HOPEFUL THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO ATTRACT TEACHERS INTO THIS PATHWAY AND GET THEM FOUR YEARS. OF LEARNING THEIR CONTENT THEORY AND BEING A STUDENT AN UNDERGRADUATE SPACE BUT WORKING ON THEIR CREDENTIAL AT THE SAME TIME. EXCITING OPPORTUNITY FOR TOP THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S GREAT THAT'S AN INFRASTRUCTURE PIECE. ALL THE LOCAL SOLUTIONS GRANT FUNDING CAME INTO OUR BUDGET THIS YEAR THAT WAS FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS SET ASIDE SPECIFICALLY FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHERS. THIS WEEK WELL IT'S BASED ON THE FUNDING FORMULA SHOULD YIELD TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED TEACHERS PLACED. IN SCHOOLS ACROSS THE STATE IN SPECIAL EDUCATION THESE WON'T NECESSARILY BE NEWLY CREDENTIALED TEACHERS BECAUSE THIS IS OUR LOCAL SOLUTION THEM IN THE LOCAL -- ELLIE ACE HAVE CHOICE ABOUT HOW THEY SPEND THESE FUNDS THEY CAN DO FORGIVABLE LOANS THEY CAN DO HIRING INCENTIVES BUT A PERSON. MUST HAVE A FULL CREDENTIAL WHEN THEY'RE HIRED INTO THIS ROLE SO IT'S NOT NECESSARILY GOING TO YIELD OVERALL TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED BRAND NEW CREDENTIAL HOLDERS BUT IT SHOULD PLACE THEM IN IT SHOULD PLACE THEM IN PLACES WHERE. WE'RE CURRENTLY SERVING STUDENTS ON EMERGENCY PERMIT SO SPECIAL EDUCATE ESPECIALLY DUCATION TEACHERS -- SO THAT'S TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED OVER THE NEXT FOUR YEARS THAT WE EXPECT TO SEE -- YOU PLACED BASED ON THAT GRANT. THE RESIDENCY PROGRAM SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS CAME IN OUR BUDGET THIS YEAR TO LAUNCH THAT PROGRAM FIFTY MILLION OF THAT IS DEDICATED TO SPECIAL EDUCATION RESIDENCIES TWENTY FIVE MILLION FOR STEM IN BILINGUAL EDUCATION. RESIDENCY IS LIKE A STUDENT TEACHING PROGRAM EXCEPT THAT THE RESIDENT ENTERS. OF THEIR PROGRAM AND SPENDS THE WHOLE YEAR IN THE CLASSROOM OF ANOTHER MASTER TEACHER SO THEY ARE RESIDENT TO WEAR A DOCTOR IS A RESIDENT UNDER. UNDER ANOTHER TEACHERS ANOTHER DOCTOR'S PRACTICE. ON THIS IS A HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM FOR BOTH PREPARING VERY STRONG AND WELL PREPARED TEACHERS. AND THEY TEND THE NATIONAL DATA INDICATE THAT TEACHERS WHO COME THROUGH RESIDENCIES TEND TO STAY IN TEACHING SO IT ADDRESSES BOTH TURN. AND GETTING FULLY PREPARED TO DO THE SAME TIME. ON THAT. THIS IS FOLLOWED THIS FOLLOWS THEN THE COMPLETION. OF A OF TEACHER PREPARATION PROPOSED BUCKLER TEACHER PREPARATION PROGRAM. IS THE TEACHER PREPARATION TO TEACH MIDDLE I COME OUT OF X. Y. Z. UNIVERSITY WITH A MAJOR IN HISTORY -- AND I GO INTO ONE OF THESE RESIDENCY PROGRAMS AND THAT IS MY TEACHER PREP. THAT'S RIGHT. SO YOU BECOME HISTORY. CREDENTIALS THE END OF THE SINGLE SUBJECT INSTRUMENT RADIUS GET MULTIPLE SUBJECT SPECIAL EDUCATION. WE'RE THIS IS THIS IS NEW GROUND FOR US AND SPECIAL EDUCATION TO DO RESIDENCY STYLE PROGRAM FOR THAT TYPE OF EDUCATOR. BUT IT'S AN EXCITING TIME TO BE DOING IT. WE HAVE OF DUNN'S WE'RE DOING SOME MAJOR THINGS WITH -- MTS SAYS ANOTHER OTHER WAYS OF THINKING ABOUT HOW WE DELIVER SERVICES TO KIDS. AND AND THIS RESIDENCY OPPORTUNITY NOW GIVES US THE CHANCE TO REALLY PREPARE NEXT GENERATION. TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED A SPECIAL EDUCATOR SHOULD BE PREPARED THROUGH THIS PROGRAM OVER THE NEXT FOUR YEARS AND AT THE END OF THAT THE GOAL IS THAT THE RESIDENCY PROGRAM ITSELF. ISN'T JUST SOMETHING THAT EXIST AS LONG AS THE GRANT FUNDING IS THERE BUT IT'S AN ONGOING INFRASTRUCTURE. SO IN ONLY A THE GETS THIS GRANT HAS BUILT PARTNERSHIPS WITH OTHER HIGHER ED PARTNERS. AND DID THIS PROGRAM CONTINUES TO EXIST AS A WAY OF BRINGING IN IN TRAINING THEIR OWN TEACHING WORKFORCE. IT'S VERY EXCITING WE AWARDED THIRTY SIX GRANTS TO ELEAZAR TO GET THAT WORK STARTED THIS YEAR. AND THEN THERE WAS ALSO A FIVE MILLION DOLLAR ONE TIME A GRANT PROVIDED TO RE ESTABLISH A CENTER FOR TEACHING CAREERS. THAT FUNDING WENT TO TULARE COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION IT WAS INITIALLY A THREE YEAR GRANT THIS IS. A WOULD HAVE BEEN THE END OF THEIR FUNDING BUT I THINK THEY HAD SOME OTHER OPPORTUNITIES COME IN AND THEY'VE GOT ANOTHER YEAR OF FUNDING. BUT THEY'VE PUT TOGETHER A VIRTUAL TEACHER RECRUITMENT -- WEB BASED PLATFORM A AND THEY'VE BEEN DOING A LOT OF TEACHER RECRUITMENT WORK THROUGH THAT AND AND HAVING BOTH OF VIRTUAL AND PHYSICAL -- RECRUITMENT. THERE'S BEEN FAIRLY SUCCESSFUL IN TERMS OF PEOPLE TEACHER CANDIDATES LOOKING FOR THROUGH THIS OPPORTUNITY TO FIND OTHER POSITIONS IN TEACHING -- SO THAT THAT PIECE IS ALSO UNDER WAY BUT THAT FUNDING WILL EXPIRE AND AND I'M NOT SURE WHAT THEIR FUTURE WILL BE. SO THAT'S WHAT THE GRANTS HAVE DONE -- TEN THOUSAND TEACHERS OR TEN THOUSAND PLACEMENTS AS A RESULT OF THIS INVESTMENT ARE EXPECTED OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS OR FOR SEASON FIVE YEARS. WILL THIS TAKE CARE OF THE PROBLEM OF SHORTAGES -- IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN WE'VE SEEN STEADY INCREASES IN TEACHER ENROLLMENT -- TEACHER EDUCATION ENROLLMENT 11% JUST IN THE LAST FROM -- 201-617-21718 SO ENROLLMENT IS GOING UP THAT'S A VERY GOOD TREND. OF WE THINK THAT SOME OF THE STIMULUS IS HELPING WITH THAT -- SO THAT'S THAT'S ONE INDICATOR THAT THAT WE MAY BE ON THE RIGHT TRACK -- BUT IN THE BIG PICTURE OVERALL THIS YEAR WE SAW ABOUT A THREE AND A HALF PERCENT INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF TEACHING CREDENTIALS WE ISSUED. TO THE FIELD THIRTY TWO HUNDRED OF THOSE CREDENTIALS WENT TO SPECIAL EDUCATORS -- IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN IN THIS IS ABOUT A 6% INCREASE FOR HIGHER EDUCATION SO AGAIN I THINK THAT THE AVAILABILITY OF STIMULUS AN OPPORTUNITY. IS ATTRACTING PEOPLE IT'S JUST ATTRACTIVE ON THE NATURAL WHEN THERE'S THESE OPPORTUNITIES ARE OUT THERE BEING ADVERTISED. WILL COME IF YOU BUILD IT THEY WILL COME MAYBE THAT'S A THEORY OF ACTION. FOR AS SO AT THE SAME TIME THAT WE'VE SEEN THAT INFLUX IN THAT INCOMING IN THAT GROWTH. WE SOULD SEVENTY EIGHT HUNDRED EMERGENCY PERMITS LAST YEAR. AND THAT'S BIG THAT'S  LOT OF CLASSROOMS EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THOSE IS A CLASSROOM OF STUDENTS BEING TAUGHT BY SOMEBODY WHO DOESN'T HAVE A CREDENTIAL. AND THAT IS OF CONCERN TO ALL OF US. ABOUT A THIRD OF THOSE WERE IN SPECIAL EDUCATION. AND THAT'S EVEN THAT'S OF EVEN GREATER CONCERN GIVEN THE SPECIAL NEEDS THAT THE STUDENTS PRESENT. IN THE SCHOOLS -- OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS WE'VE SEEN ABOUT A EMERGENCY PERMITS GOING TO SPECIAL EDUCATORS. SO THESE KINDS OF INCENTIVES ARE REALLY QUITE CRITICAL TO STEM THAT TIDE TO REPLACE THOSE EMERGENCY PERMIT HOLDERS WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE TRAINED OR IN TRAINING TO GET TO GET THIS WORK. WHAT IS THE A MURDER THE FOLKS WHO ARE TEACHING WAS EMERGENCY PERMIT HAVE HAVE TO BE CONTINUOUSLY AND ROLLED A? TEACHER PREPARATION PROGRAM THEY ARE THE PEOPLE ON EMERGENCY PERMIT DON'T QUALIFY TO GET INTO A TEACHER AT PROGRAM THEY HAVE TO HAVE A BACCALAUREATE DEGREE THEY HAVE TO ADMIT THEIR BASIC SKILLS REQUIREMENT. BUT THEY TYPICALLY HAVE NOT COMPLETED THEIR ABOUT THEIR SUBJECT MATTER REQUIREMENT THEY HAVE TO HAVE DEMONSTRATED THEY KNOW THE SUBJECT MATTER THEY'RE GOING TO TEACH WE HAVE A TESTING PROGRAM FOR THAT WE HAVE PROGRAM OPPORTUNITIES TO COMPLETE THAT. THESE PEOPLE WERE HIRED BECAUSE THERE'S AN IMMEDIATE NEED AT A LOCAL SCHOOL WHERE SOMEONE WITH THE CREDENTIAL COULD NOT BE FOUND THESE ARE FOLKS WITH IT DID YOU SAY WITHOUT A BACCALAUREATE DEGREE SO THEY HAVE TO HAVE A BACCALAUREATE DEGREE TO BE AN EMERGENCY TO REMEMBER. BUT THEY DON'T HAVE ANY TEACHER TRAINING AT ALL ON THE DISTRICT SUPERVISORS THEM AND THEY THEY ARE WORKING TO GET THEIR SUBJECT MATTER REQUIREMENT MET. SO THEY CAN THEN AND ROLL EITHER IN AN INTERN PROGRAM OR IN A TEACHING BASED PROGRAM -- BUT THAT'S TWENTY SIX HUNDRED CLASSROOMS WITH SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHERS WHO ARE NOT PREPARED. TO AND AND HAVEN'T HAD EXPERIENCE DOING IT. THAT'S SIGNIFICANT SO -- IF WE BRING TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED SPECIAL EDUCATORS IN THROUGH RESIDENCIES WHICH WE EXPECT TO DO OVER THE NEXT FOUR YEARS THAT HELPS. BUT YOU KNOW IT'S THAT THE SITUATION IS ISRAEL THAT'S THAT'S REALLY WHERE WE ARE WITH THIS. MMHM. SO THAT THAT MAY BE ENOUGH UNLESS YOU HAVE SPECIFIC QUESTIONS FOR ME THAT THAT YOU'D LIKE ME TO ELABORATE ON I'M HAPPY TO DO SO -- TEXTUAL PRESENTATION THANK YOU HELLO. I GUESS WE WANTED TO START BY TAKING A QUICK STEP BACK SO WHEN TALKING ABOUT THEIR SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHER SHORTAGE THERE REALLY THREE UNDERLYING FACTORS. FIRST IS DEMAND FOR TEACHERS HOW MANY TEACHERS DO SCHOOL DISTRICTS NEED IN OUR CLASSROOMS ONE RELEVANT FACTOR FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION IS THAT THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS IDENTIFIED WITH SPECIAL NEEDS HAS BEEN RISING OVER THE PAST DECADE. AND SO THERE'S BEEN HIGHER DEMAND FOR SUCH TEACHERS SECOND A SECOND FACTOR IS TEACHER SUPPLY. HOW MANY CREDENTIALED TEACHERS ARE NEWLY ENTERING OR RE ENTERING THE CLASSROOM THIS INCLUDES NEARLY CREDENTIALED TEACHERS TEACHERS RE ENTERING THE WORK FORCE AND TEACHERS COMING FROM OU OF STATE? LASTLY IS TEACHER TURNOVER HOW MANY TEACHERS ARE LEAVING THE CLASSROOM THIS MAY INCLUDE TEACHERS LEAVING THE PROFESSION ALTOGETHER SWITCHING DISTRICTS LEAVING THE STATE OR RETIRING. AND SO TEACHER SHORTAGE WILL RESULTS WHEN AND THE DEMANDS FOR TEACHERS IS HIGHER THAN THE SUPPLY OR THERE'S HIGH TURNOVR. ONE WAY TO MEASURE OF THAT SHORTAGE IS TO LOOK AT THE NUMBER OF TEACHERS THAT IN A GIVEN FIELD ON EMERGENCY PERMITS AS WE JUST DISCUSSED. IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN FOR EVERY ONE HUNDRED SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHER IN THE CLASSROOM THERE WERE SIX TEACHERS ON EMERGENCY COMMENTS WHICH IS A HIGHER RATIO THAN ANY OTHER SUBJECT AREA. LAST YEAR OUR OFFICE ANALYZE THE SPECIAL EDUCATION STAFFING SHORTAGE AND IDENTIFIED THREE SPECIFIC STEPS THAT. COULD HELP ADDRESS AT FIRST THE LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER SIGNALING TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO PROVIDE A STRONGER PAY INCENTIVE FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHERS. SCHOOL DISTRICTS GENERALLY DO NOT PROVIDE DIFFERENTIAL PAY LEVELS BETWEEN GENERAL EDUCATION AND SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHERS HOWEVER SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHERS TYPICALLY HAVE ADDITIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES SUCH AS DEVELOPING -- TIME CONSUMING I YOU KEYS AND COORDINATING TEAMS OF SPECIALISTS TO PROVIDE STUDENT SERVICES. THOUGH PROVIDING DIFFERENTIAL PAY IS TYPICALLY A LOCAL DECISION THAT IS NEGOTIATED THROUGH THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING PROCESS WE BELIEVE THE LEGISLATURE COULD SIGNAL ITS SUPPORT FOR DIRECT DFFERENTIAL PAY. BY REPEALING AN EXISTING STATUTORY PROVISION THAT SETS A UNIFORM SALARY SCHEDULE AS A DEFAULT DISTRICT POLICY. SECOND WE NEED THE LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER STREAMLINING BOTH PRESIDENTIAL STRUCTURE TO ALLOW SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHERS TO TEACH STUDENTS WITH MORE TYPES OF DISABILITIES WITHOUT HAVING TO ATTAIN A SECOND TEACHING CREDENTIAL. CURRENTLY TEACHERS WORKING WITH STUDENTS WITH MILD TO MODERATE DISABILITIES REQUIRE A DIFFERENT CREDENTIAL IN THOSE WERE STUDENTS WITH A MORE EXPENSIVE MARKS EXPENSIVE. SUPPORT NEEDS CONSOLIDATING THESE CREDENTIALS COULD HELP THOSE INTERESTED IN COMING SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHERS MORE EASILY NAVIGATE THE CREDENTIAL STRUCTURE. LASTLY. WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE PROVIDE. FUNDING FOR CSU TO EXPAND TRAINING PROGRAMS FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF SPECIAL EDUCATION SPECIALIST. ACCORDING TURN OUNCES THIS THIS SHORTAGE IS PARTICULARLY ACUTE FOR SPEECH LANGUAGE PATHOLOGISTS CURRENTLY SPEECH LANGUAGE PATHOLOGISTS MAY BE TRAINED AT ONE OF THE THIRTEEN CSU CAMPUS AS WE SPOKE WITH. ADMINISTRATORS AT THESE CAMPUSES AND LEARNS THAT MORE STUDENTS WERE. IN A ROLLING AND I PARTICIPATING IN THESE PROGRAMS AND THEY CAN ACCEPT. GIVEN THE HIGH DEMAND FOR THE SPECIALIST BY SCHOOL DISTRICTS WE BELIEVE CSU COULD INCREASE ENROLLMENT IN SPEECH LANGUAGE PATHOLOGY PROGRAMS BY ABOUT 5% IN NINETEEN TWENTY WITH ADDITIONAL ENROLLMENT FUNDING. WE THINK THE LEGISLATURE COULD'VE PROVIDE SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND PER CSU TO EXPAND SPEECH LANGUAGE PATHOLOGY GRADUATE PROGRAMS TO HELP REDUCE THIS ACUTE STAFFING SHORTAGE IN THIS AREA. THAT CONCLUDES MY REMARKS THANK YOU WILL IS THE DIFFICULT T. AT THE C. ISSUE CAMPUSES IS THE LIMITING FACTOR. ENROLLMENT FUNDING. OF CAPITAL ISSUES HAVING TO DO WITH CLASSROOMS OR IS IT. OF THE AVAILABILITY OF QUALIFIED FACULTY TO TEACH COURSE IN SOME. SOME FIELDS SUCH AS NURSING IT'S MY RECOLLECTION ANYWAY THAT. ONE OF THE LIMITING FACTORS WAS THE AVAILABILITY OF OF IT'S NOT A PHD BUT IT'S THE NURSING DOCTORATE. THE QUALIFIED INSTRUCTORS INSTRUCTORS TO TEACH NURSING COURSES IS THAT THE CASE WITH RESPECT TO OF SPEECH ABOUT. SO FOR SPEECH PATHOLOGY IT REALLY IS A COMBINATION OF THOSE FACTORS. BECAUSE OF POOR THERE IS A THERE IS AN LECTURE BASED COMPONENT FOR THESE PROGRAMS AND THERE'S ALSO A CLINICAL COMPONENT FOR THESE PROGRAMS AND FOR SPEECH LANGUAGE PATHOLOGY THE RATIO THAT YOU HAVE FOR A SUPERVISOR TO STUDENT IS THREE TO ONE WHICH IS. MUCH LOWER THAN IN OTHER PROGRAMS AND SO IN TERMS OF EXPANDING THESE PROGRAMS THAT ACTUALLY DOES TAKE MORE FUNDING -- TO ADD AN ADDITIONAL SPOT TO THE SPEECH LANGUAGE PATHOLOGY PROGRAMS THAN TO OTHER SPECIALISTS GRADUATE PROGRAMS WITHIN THEIR THAT'S ONE FACTOR THAT I LIMITED FOR OMITTED FROM MY LIST AND THAT'S THE AVAILABILITY OF CLINICAL SLIDES. WHICH I GUESS IS ALSO A LIMITING FACTOR IN THE OTHER. HEALTH AND ALLIED HEALTH PROFESSIONAL TRAINING PROGRAMS AS WELL WE ALSO FIND THAT TO BE A LIMITING FACTOR WITH SPEECH LANGUAGE PATHOLOGY AS WELL -- BECAUSE YOU SO IN ORDER TO RECEIVE YOUR CERTIFICATION YOU NEED A FAIR NUMBER OF HOURS THAT. WHERE YOU WORK IN A CLINIC WITH ADULTS AND ALSO WITH CHILDREN AND SO FINDING PLACEMENTS WORKING WITH ADULT IS ACTUALLY QUITE CHALLENGING -- IN TERMS OF WORKING WITH CHILDREN SCHOOL DISTRICTS CAN EASILY ACCEPT SPEECH LANGUAGE PATHOLOGIST INTERNS AND AB THOUGHT AND THEY CAN RECEIVE THEIR HOURS THAT WAY. BUT WORKING WITH ADULTS SEEMS TO BE MORE CHALLENGING SEEMS TO BE MORE LIMITING FACTOR -- AND IN IN ADDITION TO THIS RECOMMENDATION WE ACTUALLY WOULD RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDERING PROVIDING FUNDING ON A COMPETITIVE GRANT BASIS BASIS AND SO CSU CAMPUSES WOULD HAVE. TO PROVIDE ARTICULATION AS TO HOW THEY PLAN TO ADDRESS THESE DRAWBACKS AND LIMITATIONS ON EXPANDING THEIR THEIR PROGRAMS IS WHAT I'VE FOUND IS THE CLINICAL SLOT ISSUES DIFFICULT FOR US -- AT THE STATE LEVEL TO IMPACT. AS A CLINICAL **** SERVER ARE OFTEN PROVIDED BY -- FOLKS OTHER THAN STATE GOVERNMENT SO. THERE IS THE ISSUE OF SLOTS IN WHOSE FUNDING THEM AND WHERE THEY ARE AND TO BE IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR IN WHOSE COMPETING FOR THE BOTH IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR -- PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS NOT FOR PROFIT INSTITUTIONS AND THE AND THE STATE PROGRAMS WELL YES ONE OTHER QUESTION I'M LOOKING AT THIS CHART HERE. OF IN THE ANALYSIS ON PAGE. EIGHTEEN AND I EVERYBODY WE USING THE TERM EMERGENCY PERMITS AND DO WE CALL IT SOMETHING ELSE IN OUR CHART OR IS THE EMERGENCY PERMIT. PEACE NOT ON OUR CHART. SO WE DO HAVE -- SO FOR EMERGENCY PERMITS AND AND ACTUALLY ON PAGE SEVENTEEN ARE A YES ON EIGHTEEN IF YOU SEE. THREE PARAGRAPHS LISA MINUS EIGHTEEN OF IT THE MERCHANTS WHO PERMITS ARE ARE IN TURN PERMITS ARE SHORT TERM STAFF PERMITS SO IT'S EASY IS BROKEN OUT. AND ON THE CHART WHAT YOU'LL SEE IS IF YOU SEE THE PROVISIONAL IN TURN THE PET. AND THE SHORT TERM STAFF PERMIT WHICH IS THE STEPS THOSE TWO ARE CONSIDERED OUR EMERGENCY PERMITS TOGETHER COMBINED YEAH THANK YOU YOU WELCOME IT'S IN THE TEXT. WELL I UNDERSTAND YEAH AND YOU'LL SEE YOU KNOW I I THINK JUST JUST TO POINT OUT FOR YOU ON THIS CHART YOU KNOW IF YOU'LL NOTE THAT THOSE TWO COMBINED IT JUST JUST UNDER 2% WHICH DOESN'T SEEM LIKE A HUGE AMOUNT. BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE NUMBER SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN AND YOU COMBINE THOSE THAT'S ALMOST. SIX THOUSAND PERMITS THAT IF YOU WOULD CONSIDER THEY MAY BE IN A CLASSROOM WITH EVEN TWENTY FIVE STUDENTS EACH. THAT IS A TON OF STUDENTS WHO WERE IN CLASSROOMS. FOR A YEAR OR MORE DEPENDING ON HOW MANY TIMES THE END UP WITH THE TEACHERS UNDERPREPARED -- THAT THEY'RE YOU KNOW NOT GETTING THE BENEFIT OF FULLY PREPARED TEACHER TEACHING THEM FOR THE YEAR SO. THANK YOU APPRECIATE THAT EXPLANATION OF ANYTHING ELSE EXCELLENT PRESENTATION OKAY. ISSUE NUMBER -- WELL ACT ITEM NUMBER SIX ONE ZERO ZERO DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION ISSUE NUMBER SIX STATE OPERATIONS OUR PANELISTS WOULD IDENTIFY THEMSELVES TO THE RECORD STORE IN MY LEFT YOU ARE RIGHT SIR. AT HANSON DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THANK YOU SIR. LISA WAS READING. THANK YOU MA'AM [inaudible] CORTES ILIO. AND WE'RE CABALLERO. AND I CONGRATULATE YOU YOU LINED UP. IN ORDER. SO WHO WANTS TO START. I'LL START FIRST -- AGAIN ENHANCE THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. PROVIDE A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION'S BUDGET AND THEN I'LL MOVE ON TO QUICKLY COVER SOME OF THE SPECIFIC AUGMENTATIONS TO THE STATE OPERATIONS BUDGET. THAT ARE INCLUDED WITHIN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. ARE THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROVIDES FOUR HUNDRED FOUR MILLION DOLLARS IN SUPPORT FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND STATE SPECIAL SCHOOLS.

IF YOU HAVE ANY SPECIFIC QUESTIONS ON THOSE PROPOSALS I I WILL DO MY BEST ANSWER BUT I MAY NEED MY COLLEAGUES TO COME UP AND ADDRESS. ANYTHING SPECIFIC THANK YOU NO QUESTIONS GOOD PRESENTATION OHIO. GOOD AFTERNOON SIR CORTEZ WITH LA L. SO PAGE TWENTY FOUR OF YOUR AGENDA INCLUDES A TABLE THAT SHOWS -- ARE THE WORKLOAD PROPOSALS THAT ARE ISSUED RECOMMENDATIONS SO TODAY I'LL FOCUS MY COMMENTS -- ON THE PROPOSAL'S WHERE THE TABLE NOTES THAT WE WITHHELD RECOMMENDATIONS BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN SOME UPDATE SINCE THIS TABLE IS PRODUCED. ON THE SECOND PROPOSAL LISTED WHERE WE WITHHELD RECOMMENDATIONS A WE RECENTLY RECEIVED SOME INFORMATION SO WILL REVIEW THOSE PROPOSALS ARE REVIEW THAT INFORMATION AND WE'LL NOTIFY YOUR STUFF IF WE HAVE ANY CONCERNS -- SO ON THE FIRST A ONE WHERE WE WITHHELD RECOMMENDATIONS THIS WAS WITH REGARDS TO TWELVE POSITIONS FOR THE EARLY LEARNING AND CARE DIVISION. NINE OF THOSE POSITIONS ARE FOR EXISTING WORKLOAD AND THREE OF THE POSITIONS ARE SO SHOULD WITH NEW WORKLOAD PROPOSED WITHIN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. SO FOR THE POSITIONS PROPOSED WITH IN THE QUé BEFORE THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL SO THOSE THREE POSITIONS OF THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO WAIT AS THOSE PROPOSAL ARE STILL BEING DEVELOPED IN -- THE PROGRAMS MIGHT BE MORE OMPLEX THERE MIGHT BE ADDITIONAL STAFFING THAT NEEDS TO BE PROVIDED FOR THOSE SPECIFIC REPOSE PROPOSALS -- IF LIKE AN EVALUATIN COMPONENT IS ADDED THEY MIGHT BE ADDITIONAL STAFFING NEEDS SO WE'RE HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU -- TO IF YOU WANTED TO EXPLORE WITH THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF STAFFING FOR THOSE NEW -- FOR THOSE NEW PROPOSALS. THE REMAINING NINE POSITION ARE FOR EXISTING WORKLOAD AND AND WE'VE AND WE'VE REVIEWED THESE THESE PIECES AND I'LL TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THESE IN DETAIL. SO THREE OF THE PUT AND ALL OF THESE POSITIONS ARE PERMANENT POSITION. SO THREE OF THE POSITIONS ARE FOR TITLE FIVE COMPLIANCE MONITORING AND THIS IS SO THAT CD YOU COULD INCREASE THE FREQUENCY IN WHICH IT MONITORS -- WHICH IS THAT IT WHICH TO CONDUCT THESE TITLE COMP TITLE FIVE COMPLIANCE REVIEWS UNDERSTATE REGULATIONS ARE REQUIRED TO DO THEM ONCE EVERY THREE YEARS VISIT EVERY CONTRACTOR -- AND THEY'VE INDICATED THAT THEY'RE CURRENTLY DOING IT ONCE EVERY FIVE YEARS WE DO NOT HEAR THAT WE THINK THERE SOME LEGISLATIVE DISCRETION -- WITH REGARDS TO THESE COMPLIANCE MONITORING BECAUSE THERE'S BECAUSE THIS IS THE STATE REQUIREMENT. SO THERE'S SOME -- AND YOU MAY WANT TO CONSIDER OTHER MONITORING THAT TAKES PLACE FOR CHILD CARE PROVIDERS FOR EXAMPLE MOST PROVIDERS GO THROUGH HAVE TO DO SOME LICENSING INSPECTIONS AND THEY HAVE TO COMPLY WITH HEALTH AND SAFETY STANDARDS AND SOMEBODY GOES OUT TO THE FIELD -- TO TO ANNUALLY VISIT THESE PROVIDERS AND THERE'S ALSO ANOTHER MINUTE ON SITE MONITORING SYSTEM CALLED THE QUALITY RADIO READING -- INFORMATION SYSTEM SO WE THINK THERE'S SOME DISCUSSION HERE ON THOSE. THREE POSITIONS. ON TE NEXT SET OF POSITIONS ARE FOR PERMANENT POSITIONS FOR FISCAL CMPLIANCE MONITORING. AND THESE. AND THESE POSITIONS ARE TO ALSO INCREASE THE INCREASE. INCREASE THE FREQUENCY IN WHICH FISCAL COMPLIANCE REVIEWS FOR EACH CONTRACTOR SO THERE SO THEY ARE ALSO GOING TO DO IT ONCE EVERY THREE YEARS INSTEAD OF ONCE EVERY FIVE YEARS AS EIGHT INDICATED THEY'RE CURRENTLY DOING. CD CLAIMS THAT THESE POSITIONS ARE NECESSARY TO COMPLY WITH FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS BUT ON OUR REVIEW A WE'VE NOTED THAT THEY DON'T REQUIRE. THEY DON'T REQUIRE A VISIT ONCE EVERY THREE YEARS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOES REQUIRE THE STATE TO CALCULATE AND IMPROPER% PAYMENT RATE ONCE EVERY THREE YEARS -- USE BUT THAT'S TO USE A SAMPLE OF PROVIDERS THAT THEY DON'T NEED TO VISIT A SO BECAUSE OF THAT WE RECOMMEND REJECTING THESE POSITIONS. THAT THERE IS ONE POSITION PROVIDED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET FOR A REGULATORY COORDINATOR -- WE RECOMMEND YOU REJECTING A WE DON'T THINK SEE THIS WORKLOAD AS ONGOING WORK LOAD. AND THERE'S A POSITION FOR THEIR INCLUSIVE REALLY EDUCATION SPEND EXPANSION PROGRAM IT'S ONE PERMANENT POSITION THIS WAS A PROGRAM CREATED IN THE EIGHTEEN EIGHTEEN BUDGET WE DO RECOGNIZE THAT WORKLOAD I RECKON RECOMMEND APPROVING THAT POSITION. AND THAT CONCLUDES MY REMARKS BUT I'M HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS YOU. NO QUESTIONS ELEVEN QUESTIONS. THIS IS A WHOLE OPEN ITEM SO WE WILL DO THAT WE WILL BE REVISITING IT VERY VERY SOON THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION. WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A FIVE MINUTE RECESS SO TIME TO STRETCH COME BACK ON ISSUE NUMBER SEVEN THE SUBCOMMITTEE'S BACK IN SESSION THANK YOU FOR THE BREAK. SOMEBODY OLD LIKE ME KIDS AT THE PARK. ISSUE NUMBER SEVN UNIFORM COMPLAINT PROCEDURES MA'AM. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS DIANA THEATER SOME FROM THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE WITH YOU THIS AFTERNOON. SPEAK TO YOU ABOUT THE UNIFORM COMPLAINT PROCEDURES -- I KNOW THAT YOU HAD TO QUESTIONS CONCERNING OUR REPORT ONE WAS IN REGARDS TO THE TIME LINES. FOR SCABBERS SHEEN -- IT DOUBLES FOR COMPLETING THE CHANGES IDENTIFIED IN THE REPORT THAT WAS ISSUED TO YOU -- AS WELL AS WHAT WERE THE KEY FINDINGS FROM THE STAKEHOLDER PROCESS THAT WE ENGAGED IN. YOUR TO ANSWER QUESTIONS BY WAY OF BACKGROUND I THOUGHT MIGHT BE HELPFUL TO PROVIDE YOU WITH A QUICK OVERVIEW OF WHAT IS THE UNIFORM COMPLAINT PROCEDURES. WE GET THAT A LOT AND SO THE UNIFORMED COMPLAINTS PROCEDURES OR THE UC P. AS WE REFER TO THEM WERE ESTABLISHED BY STATE REGULATIONS IN. NINETEEN NINETY ONE I'M TO DEVELOP A UNIFORM SYSTEM FOR RESPONDING TO COMPLAINTS I'M AT A LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICT AND DIRECT FROM THE CHARTER LEVEL OR AN ALLEY A LEVEL THIS ALSO COULD BE A COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION -- THE AT THE TIME THERE WERE SIX PROGRAMS THAT WERE INCLUDED IN THE REGULATIONS SO NOT ALL COMPLAINTS FALL WITH IN THE UC P.. THERE WERE SIX NOW THERE ARE A TOTAL OF SIXTEEN SO YOU CAN SEE IS A NINETEEN NINETY ONE AT THAT NUMBER HAS INCREASED. AND THE PROCESS IS GENERALLY THAT -- INDIVIDUALS COMPLAINTS FILED COMPLAINTS USUALLY PARENTS AT A LOCAL LEVEL FIRST FOR THE pRESOLVE. AND IF THE COMPLAINT IS UNSATISFIED WITH THAT RESOLUTION AND THEY MAY APPEAL AT THE STATE LEVEL TO THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. THERE'S A WIDE ARRAY OF PROGRAMS WITH IN THE UC P. AND THEY ARE A BROAD SPECTRUM OF PROGRAMS -- THE MOST COMMON ARE THOSE COMPLAINTS RELATED TO DISCRIMINATION BOWLING HARASSMENT -- ON THE BASIS OF A PROTECTED CHARACTERISTIC. THERE ARE OTHERS SUCH AS UNLAWFUL PEOPLE FEES WHICH COULD BE FOR EXAMPLE THE CHARGING OF GRADUATION CAPS AND GOWNS AND ALSO SEEMS TO BE. A VERY POPULAR [inaudible] ONE SO I'M. THE AS A RESULT OF HAVING SO MANY DIFFERENT PROGRAMS THERE ARE A NUMBER OF OFFICES WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT THAT PROCESS THE APPEALS AND SOMETIMES COMPLAINTS. I'M RELATED TO THE UCP COMPLAINTS AND THERE ARE IT SHOULD ADD THAT THERE ARE SOME CASES WHERE THE DEPARTMENT CAN DIRECTLY INTERVENE -- BUT IT FOR THE MOST PART -- THESE ARE RESOLVED AT A LOCAL LEVEL AT A DISTRICT LEVEL AND THEN THEY CAN APPEAL AT THE STATE LEVEL IF THE COMPLAINTS ARE NOT SATISFIED. I'M BECAUSE OF THE NUMBER OF A PROGRAMS IN OFFICES WORKING ACROSS THE DEPARTMENT ON THESE TYPES OF APPEALS. THE DEPARTMENT FELT IT WAS IMPORTANT SEVERAL YEARS AGO THAT WE BUILT SOME COORDINATION ACROSS THE DEPARTMENT EVERYONE IS KIND OF WORKING ON THEIR OWN AND WE REALLY THOUGHT HE NEEDED% TO INCREASE. THE COORDINATION AS WELL AS THE EFFICIENCY AND HOW WE PROCESS APPEALS AND COMPLAINTS. I'M AND THIS STARTED PROBABLY ABOUT IN TWENTY SIXTEEN WE START HAVING DISCUSSIONS ABOUT HOW WE CAN DO THAT AS YOU'RE AWARE THERE WAS AN AUDIT IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN THAT ALSO HAD SOME RECOMMENDATIONS -- PRIOR -- TO THE AUDIT WE HAD TALKED ABOUT CONSTRUCTING OR DEVELOPING A CENTRAL TRACKING SYSTEM WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT BY WHICH EACH PROGRAM OFFICE WOULD -- INSERT DATA RELATIVE -- TO ALL OF A PLATE APPEALS AND COMPLAINTS THAT COME TO THE DEPARTMENT SO THAT WE WOULD HAVE A CENTRAL SYSTEM FOR TRACKING AND LOGGING THESE TYPES OF COMPLAINTS AN APPEALS. RELATIVE TO THE UC PEOPLE. AFTER THE AUDIT ONE OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS WAS THAT WE DEVELOP A CENTRAL TRACKING SYSTEM AS WELL AS DEVELOP. OUR CREATE A CENTRAL OFFICE -- AFTER THE AUDIT THE DEPARTMENT CONTINUED -- TO LOOK AT WAYS IN WHICH YOU CAN CONSTRUCT A CENTRAL TRACKING SYSTEM AND WE WERE ABLE TO DO THAT AN AS OF OCTOBER. TWENTY SEVENTEEN ALL PROGRAM OFFICES WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT ENTERED THEIR DATE AND EVERYTHING IS LOGGED INTO ONE CENTRAL TRACKING OFFICE. AND WE ALSO CONTINUED -- AS PART OF SB EIGHT FORTY TO ENGAGE IN A STAKEHOLDER PROCESS AND WE THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAS DONE THIS -- REGARDING THE UCP SO WE WERE REALLY EXCITED AND WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ANSWERED AND ASK THE RIGHT QUESTIONS SO WE DID HOLD PRE MEETINGS PREVIOUSLY WITH A SMALL GROUP. OF STAKEHOLDERS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WERE ASKING THE RIGHT QUESTIONS WHAT WE FOUND DURING THE SPREE STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS WAS THAT THERE WAS A GENERAL LACK OF UNDERSTANDING OR INFORMATION RELATIVE TO WHAT THE UC P. IS AND WHAT IT IS NOT. WHAT PROGRAMS ARE INCLUDED IN THE U. P. AND THIS IS AT ALL LEVELS OF THE PARENT LEVEL PLUS YOU -- PARENTS AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS -- AND THERE WAS ALSO A FEELING OF THAT DAY AT THE STATE LEVEL IS VERY COMPLEX AND CONFUSING FOR INDIVIDUALS -- WE THEN DECIDED THAT WE NEEDED TO FOCUS OUR QUESTIONS ON THE GENERAL UNDERSTANDING OF THE U. C. P. AS WELL AS WHAT AVAILABLE RESOURCES AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. ARE AVAILABLE TO PARENTS AND TO ADMINISTRATORS AND TEACHERS AT A LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICT LEVEL. AND SO ARE QUESTIONS REALLY REVOLVED AROUND THE CLARITY OF THE UC. WHAT INFORMATION DO PEOPLE KNOW ABOUT THE UC WHAT IS IT THAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO NOW? AND THE SECOND WAS ABOUT THE UNIFORM AND CONSISTENCY UNIFORMITY. WHAT WERE THEIR THOUGHTS ABOUT THE UNIFORMITY WHAT WOULD THEY LIKE TO SEE RELATIVE TO THAT? AND THE THIRD AREA WAS WHAT AVAILABLE GUIDANCE AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IS OUT THERE. AND SO THOSE WERE THE THREE AREAS WE ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT WHAT WE FOUND WAS VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT WE DISCOVERED IN OUR PRE MEETINGS. AND THAT IS THAT THE STAKEHOLDERS REALLY STRESS A GENERAL LACK OF CLARITY AROUND THE U. C. P.. AND THIS REALLY INCLUDED -- REGARDING THE ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES AT THE STATE AND THE LOCAL LEVEL -- CLARITY REGARDING THE PURPOSE OF THE UC P. I'M THE INVESTIGATIVE PROCESS AND TIME LINES SO IN ALL ASPECTS OF THE UC P. -- THAT THERE WAS A NEED FOR MORE UNIFORMITY AND CONSISTENCY FOR PROCESSING OF COMPLAINTS AND APPEALS. I'M. SPECIFICALLY THAT THERE NEEDED TO BE CLEAR EXPECTATIONS IN THE PROCESS THE PARENTS REALLY NEEDED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE STEPS WERE INVOLVED IN WITH THE TIME. SWORE THAT THEY NEEDED TO BE CONSISTENT BOTH AT A LOCAL LEVEL AND STATE LEVEL AND AS A YOU KNOW RECENTLY -- THERE WAS LEGISLATION THAT WAS PASSED THAT REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT TO ALSO HAVE A SIXTY DAY TIMELINE WHICH IS THE SAME TIMELINE THAT DISTRICTS HAVE SO THAT IS IN AN EFFORT TO BECOME A MORE UNIFORM. THE BIGGEST WAS THAT THERE WAS A NEED FOR GUIDANCE AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND LOCAL LEVEL -- THIS INCLUDED TRAINING FOR ADMINISTRATORS ARE CONDUCTING INVESTIGATIONS -- WE ALSO FOUND THAT THERE WAS A HIGH TURNOVER RATE AND SOMETIMES IN THE ADMINISTRATORS THAT ARE. PLACED WITH THIS RESPONSIBILITY -- THAT THEY'RE ALSO NEEDED TO BE THINGS LIKE RESOURCES FAQS TEMPLATES -- ANY TYPE OF GODLY GUIDANCE DOCUMENTS. SO OVERALL WE FOUND IT -- STAKEHOLDERS FELT IT WAS COMPLEX CONFUSING AND INCONSISTENT AND THAT THERE WAS A DISCONNECT BETWEEN THE STATE LEVEL AND THE LOCAL LEVEL. SO IN RESPONSE TO THAT WE FELT THAT WE NEEDED TO DO SOMETHING. AND TO DO SOMETHING DRASTIC AND SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE I'M ALSO ARE DOING AS PART OF A RESPONSE TO THIS IS CREATING A CENTRAL OFFICE WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT. SO WE'RE RESEARCHING CURRENTLY WEIGHS ABOUT HOW WE CAN TO RESTRUCTURE OUR OFFICES IN OUR STAFFING TO THAT WE CAN STAFF. A CENTRAL OFFICE APPROPRIATELY THIS OFFICE WOULD RECEIVE AND PROCESS ALL APPEALS AND COMPLAINTS SO THERE WOULD BE ONE OFFICE WHERE IS IN THE PAST COMPLAINTS ARE DISTRICTS WOULD HAVE TO CALL THE APPROPRIATE PROGRAM OFFICE THAT WAS -- WORKING ON THEIR TYPES OF COMPLAINTS WE WE JUST HAVE ONE PHONE NUMBER ONE EMAIL -- WE ALSO ARE UPDATING ACTUALLY UPDATED OUR REGULATIONS RELATED TO THE UCP. THAT WAS REQUIRED IN STATUTE BUT IN ADDITION TO THAT WE TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY -- TO PROPOSING CHANGES THAT WE FELT WERE IN DIRECT RESPONSE TO WHAT STAKEHOLDERS WERE TELLING US ONE OF THE THINGS WAS TO PROVIDE SOME MORE CLARITY. ABOUT THE PROCESS AND ABOUT THE ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF DISTRICTS AS WELL AS AT THE STATE LEVEL -- ANOTHER WAS EXTENDING THE PERIOD BY WHICH TO COMPLAIN CAN APPEAL. THE COMPLAINT AND THE STATE LEVEL PREVIOUSLY IT WAS FIFTEEN DAYS WE HAVE HEARD FROM STAKEHOLDERS THAT THAT WAS NOT ENOUGH TIME THEY NEEDED ADDITIONAL TIME. SAID WE INCREASED THAT TO THIRTY DAY. THERE WILL BE A PUBLIC HEARING A RELATIVE TO THE REGULATIONS. ON MONDAY THIS COMING MONDAY THE THIRTEENTH IN THE DEPARTMENT. WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF A FORTY FIVE DAY COMMENT PERIOD. ON THAT WILL END AND THEN WE WILL REVIEW ALL OF THE COMMENTS THE GOAL IS TO IF EVERYTHING GOES AS LANNED THAT THOSE REGULATIONS WILL BE ADOPTED IN IN PLACE BY JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY I'M IN RESPECT TO OUR CENTRAL OFFICE WE WORKING ON THAT WE EXPECT. THAT WILL BE COMPLETED WITHIN THREE TO SIX MONTHS -- IN ADDITION TO THAT WE WANTED TO CREATE A MULTI FACETED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE APPROACH -- WE UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S A GREAT NEED FOR THAT -- AND WE ARE WILLING TO RESPOND TO THAT. AND THIS WILL OF COURSE TAKE PLACE OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT YEAR. AND WE WILL HAVE TO BE VERY STRATEGIC ABOUT IT AND WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT NOT ONLY ARE WE PROVIDING GENERAL FAQS AND GUIDANCE AND TEMPLATES. BUT ALSO SOME TARGETED I'M TRAINING WHERE IT IS NEEDED WE'VE SEEN ANECDOTAL KLAY. THAT THERE'S A WIDE RANGE OF NEEDS THERE ARE SOME DISTRICTS THAT HAVE STRUCTURES IN PLACE -- ABLE TO RESPOND TO COMPLAINTS AND INVESTIGATE THEM AND THERE ARE OTHER DISTRICTS THAT DON'T HAVE THOSE. TODAY SPOKE ABOUT THE NEED IN RURAL AREAS AND WE'VE SEEN THAT DISTRICTS ARE LAWYERS HAVE LESS RESOURCES SO WE'RE LOOKING AT ALL WAYS THAT WE CAN -- PROVIDE RESOURCES MAYBE CONNECT DISTRICTS THAT SOME HAVE RESOURCES AND OTHERS THAT DON'T TO THAT WE CAN ESTABLISH A COMMUNITY -- WE ALSO WANT TO DEVELOP PARTNERSHIPS NOT ONLY INTERNALLY WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT BUT EXTERNALLY AS WELL TO SEE WHAT EXISTING STRUCTURES ARE ALREADY OUT THERE IN TERMS OF TRAINING -- SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO REINVENT THE WHEEL OR OVER BURDENED DISTRICTS WHO WANT TO PROVIDE TRAINING AND RESOURCES TO THEM IN A WAY THAT MAKES SENSE. SO I WILL BE RESEARCHING NOT -- AS SOON AS WE CAN DEVELOP OUR CENTRAL OFFICE AND OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT YEAR WE WOULD LIKE TO IMPLEMENT. AND HAVE A PLAN IN PLACE FOR THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. AND I THINK THAT'S ALL I HAVE FOR MY PRESENTATION IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS WITH JUST A COUPLE OF THE COMPLAINT PROCESS IN. HOW IT WORKS OUR ANALYSIS INDICATED THAT? THERE WERE ABOUT -- FOUR SIXTY FIVE REQUESTED CD ACCEPTED ONE HUNDRED NINETY THREE APPEAL OR COMPLAINT REQUESTS. IN EIGHT UCP PROGRAMS DO YOU MAINTAIN STATISTICS ON WHY COMPLAINTS ARE NOT ACCEPTED IN. IN IN SOME DETAIL HER RIGHT SO WE WE ACTUALLY JUST SPOKE ABOUT THAT YESTERDAY SO WITH OUR NEW DATABASE IT'S RELATIVELY NEW WE ARE -- CONSTANTLY LOOKING AT HOW WE CAN BETTER COLLECT DATA. ON THIS IS A NEW VENTURE FOR US IF YOU WILL WE HAVE NOT COLLECTED IN AND REALLY ANALYZE THE DATA WE'VE ALWAYS BEEN IN THE BUSINESS OF PROCESSING APPEALS -- SO WE ARE LOOKING AT THAT AND IN LOOKING AT WAYS THAT WE CAN BETTER TEASE OUT OF THE YOU KNOW THE REASONS WHY WE'RE NOT ACCEPTING AND WHAT I CAN TELL YOU. IS THAT A LOT OF TIMES -- COMPLAINTS MAY BE FRUSTRATED AND A DISTRICT LEVEL ONE SO THEY WANT TO COME DIRECTLY TO THE STATE TO FILE A COMPLAINT. AND WE DO -- ALLOWED DISTRICTS THE REGULATIONS REQUIRE US TO ALLOW DISTRICTS TO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO RESOLVE THAT COMPLAINT LOCALLY DISTRICTS DO YOU HAVE TO HAVE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES IN PLACE FOR RESOLVING COMPLAINTS. SO WE DO REFER THOSE BACK TO THE DISTRICT WELL THE REASON I ASK IS IF 71% OF THE COMPLAINTS ARE IN THE EDUCATION EQUITY AREA OF HEELS RELATED DELEGATION SIBLING HARASSMENT DISCRIMINATION RETALIATION OR INTIMIDATION. ON THE BASIS OF PROTECTED CHARACTERISTICS. IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO US AS A LEGISLATURE TO UNDERSTAND. WHAT WE KNOW THAT THERE WERE COMPLAINTS FILED IN WHY COMPLAINTS WERE NOT ACCEPTED? WAS THE EVIDENCE DEEM TO BE INSUFFICIENT THE COMPLAIN ITSELF FAILED TO ALLEGE. THE THE ALLEGATIONS NECESSARY JUST TO AT LEAST FROM UP. ALLEGATIONS TEN POINT SUPPORT OF BULLYING CLAIM OR A RESTAURANT OR DISCRIMINATION CLAIM AND I REALIZE. YOU'RE IN THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING YOUR YOUR SYSTEM BUT IN DEVELOPING YOUR SYSTEM. PARTICULARLY IN THAT CATEGORY. OF I WOULD THINK WE WOULD WANT THE SAME LEVEL OF DETAIL. AVAILABLE AS WE WOULD EXPECT FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT HOUSING SURE OR THE LABOR COMMISSIONER OTHER GOVERNMENT AGENCIES SUCH AS THAT WHEN DEALING WITH SIMILAR TYPE CLAIMS. SO IN GENERAL AND I CAN TELL YOU IS THAT SOMETIMES -- THE APPEAL IS INCOMPLETE I'M IN THOSE CASES WE DO REFER BACK TO THE COMPLAINT AND LET THEM KNOW THAT -- IT WAS INCOMPLETE AND GIVE THEM ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY SUBMIT THE INFORMATION THAT IS NEEDED. REQUIREMENTS IS -- ALSO SOMETIMES. IN DAYS TO APPEAL ON SOMETIMES -- DEPENDING WE TRY TO ALLOW SOME FLEXIBILITY BUT IN SOME CASES IT IS UNTIMELY. HI BUT I THINK I GUESS WHAT I'M. JUST TO GO BASS I WOULD ASK THAT YOU PROVIDED TO THE SUBCOMMITTEE STAFF SURE -- IN THE POLICY COMMITTEE STAFF SO THAT WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO SEE. IT'S WERE -- NOT ACCEPTED OR REJECTED AND TRACK WHETHER IT'S BECAUSE THEY WERE ON TIGHTLY. WEATHER INFORMATION BY THE BACKUP INFORMATION WAS NOT ATTACHED AND THEN I I IT. FROM MY PERSPECTIVE I WOULD WANT TO SEE THOSE THAT WERE RETURNED TO COMPLAIN IS WHAT PERCENTAGE CAME BACK. OF WITH THE ISSUES CURED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE COMMUNICATION PROCESS IS CLEAR IN THE PIPELINE IS UNOBSTRUCTED. THAT MAKES SENSE. AND THEN MY FOLLOWING QUESTION HAS TO DO WITH THESE CATEGORIES INCLUDING THE EDUCATIONAL EQUITY CATEGORY. THAT ARE SET OUT ON TWENTY SEVEN TWENTY EIGHT OF OUR ANALYSIS A AND I I'M. SORT OF INTERESTED IN WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THE COMPLAINTS WORSE BUT WERE SUBSTANTIATED ON APPEAL. AND IF YOU HAVE THE LOS TO TO I DIDN'T SEE IT ANYWHERE IN HERE AND I DIDN'T I DIDN'T CATCH IT IN YOUR PRESENTATION. WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THE COMPLAINTS AND HE'S VERY SCATTERGORIES WERE SUBSTANTIATED? AND TO THE EXTENT THAT CD HAS A CORRECTIVE ACTION AUTHORITY WHO -- WHAT CORRECTIVE ACTION WAS TAKEN TO MAKE SENSE YES ANY SECULAR? I WOULD BE CONCERNED ABOUT THE HARASSMENT DISCRIMINATION INTIMIDATION SO IF YOU. IF YOU -- OUT OF A HUNDRED AND THIRTY SEVEN COMPLAINTS DID YOU SUBSTANTIATE 50% OF THOSE. AND IN THOSE CASES WHAT HAPPENED AFTER THE COMPLAINT WAS SUBSTANTIATED SO WE CAN TRACK SURE HOW THIS PROCESS WORKS IN. AND AND ALSO TRACK TRENDS I WOULD THINK WOULD BE IMPORTANT SURE. AND WE CAN GET THAT INFORMATION TO YOU DON'T HAVE. TO LIVE IN QUESTION I'M GOOD THANK YOU. I GUESS THAT'S GREAT SO YOU DID A GREAT JOB THANK YOU. OKAY NEXT ITEM IS SIX EIGHT SEVEN ZERO CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES ISSUE NUMBER EIGHT IS STATE OPERATIONS [inaudible] ONE DOWN.

GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ALSO PROVIDES FOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND ONE TIME NON PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND FOR A STAFFING CONTRACT FOR THE ACTIVITIES REQUIRED OF THE FUNDING FORMULA OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE. WHICH WAS ESTABLISHED IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET ACT. IT IS ALSO REQUESTED THAT A TECHNICAL ADJUSTMENT CAN BE MADE TO SHIFT FUNDING LEVELS FOR VARIOUS BONDS THAT SUPPORT THE CHANCES OFFICES STATE OPERATIONS. I THINK THEY NEED YOU TO PULL YOUR MICHAEL LITTLE CLOSER MA'AM. SURE. EVERYBODY WANTS TO HEAR THIS BETTER PERFECT. SHOULD SHOULD I START AGAIN -- IF THERE'S OBJECTION BACK THERE WILL DO IT.

IT IS ALSO REQUESTED THAT A TECHNICAL ADJUSTMENT BE MADE TO SHIFT FUNDING LEVELS FOR VARIOUS BONDS THAT SUPPORT THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICES STATE OPERATIONS. SPECIFICALLY THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE OFFICES FACILITIES PLANNING UNIT. THIS ADJUSTMENT ALIGNS THE BOND FUNDING SO THAT THE OLDEST BONDS WITH AVAILABLE RESOURCES ARE USED FIRST AND MAKES NO CHANGES TO THE FUNDING LEVEL PROPOSED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. THANK YOU AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU. YES SIR ALEJO AND BROUGHT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE -- WE DO HAVE CONCERNS WITH THE FACILITIES PLANNING UNIT -- REQUEST OR THE FRONT THE TOP FUNDING FOR THE FUNDING FORMULA OR GROUP THEY WOULD WANT TO DISCUSS THE WE HAD SOME -- ASSESSMENT OF THE ONE POSITION FOR INFORMATION SECURITY OFFICER. I'M WE DO THINK THAT IN TALKING THE CHANCES OF THAT THERE'S MERIT TO TO HAVING AN INFORMATION SECURITY OFFICER -- GIVEN OUR CONVERSATIONS WITH THEM -- THE TENS OFFICE AND STAFF OF THE DIGITAL INNOVATION INFRASTRUCTURE DIVISION THERE IS. A NEED FOR ADDITIONAL -- STAFF I CAN WORK ON IMPROVING THE INFORMATION SECURITY THERE -- THE THERE WAS A REVIEW BY THE MILITARY DEPARTMENT HER DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN DOING REVIEWS OF STATE AGENCIES OVER MULTIPLE YEARS -- AND AND PROVIDING FEEDBACK AND THEY ARE IN THE PROCESS TO TRY TO MAKE THESE CHANGES THAT WE THINK ANOTHER STAFF PERSON TO MAKE THEM FOR THAT. WE DO RECOMMEND HOWEVER THAT THAT -- UP POSITION BE HIRED USING EXISTING RESOURCES THE CHANCES OF IT HAS RECEIVED AUGMENTATIONS OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTEEN THOUSAND GENERAL FUND AND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN AND TWO MILLION DOLLARS IN. EIGHTEEN NINETEEN TO GO TO THE LAST -- AUGMENTATION THE TWO MILLION THERE WERE NO SPECIFIC -- BUT THERE WAS NO SPECIFICATION IN TERMS OF WHAT WAS EXPECTED OF THE CHANCES OFFICE TO DO WITH THOSE FUNDS AND AND SO WE THINK THAT GIVEN FOR THE HIGH PRIORITY WITH PASSION BE. ARM A PLACE WHERE SOME OF THOSE RESOURCES ARE USED [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR SENATOR LEYVA OF I'VE HANDED OUT A FOLDER I WILL NOT WALK THROUGH THE DETAILS HERE -- WE APPRECIATE THE POSITION INCLUDED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET FOR AN INFORMATION SECURITY OFFICER WE ARE A SMALL AGENCY -- BUT OUR INFORMATION -- THE DATA WE COLLECT -- SPANS A VERY LARGE SYSTEM WE HAVE STOOD LEVEL RECORDS TODAY WE DON'T HAVE. A A DEDICATED INFORMATION SECURITY OFFICER THOSE POSITIONS OF THOSE DUTIES ARE -- DISTRIBUTED ACROSS -- I. T. STAFF ACROSS OR AGENCY WE THINK IT MAKES SENSE -- FOR THE TYPE OF WORK WE'RE DOING THAT WE HAVE INFORMATION SECURITY OFFICER. WE AGAIN APPRECIATE -- THE PROPOSAL AROUND THE FACILITIES PLANNING IT. OUR BOARD OF GOVERNORS ADOPTED A REQUEST IN THE FALL WHICH IS WHAT ARE -- THE PACKET -- INCLUDES THAT INCLUDES TWO DIFFERENT COMPONENTS THE FIRST. IS OUR FULL STATE OPERATIONS REQUEST FOR TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY A TOTAL OF SEVENTEEN AND A HALF POSITIONS ONE AS WE TALKED ABOUT FUNDED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. WE APPRECIATE THE MAY REVISION PROPOSAL WHICH WE FOUND OUT ABOUT TODAY THAT INCLUDES THREE ADDITIONAL POSITIONS. THAT ARE INCLUDED ON HERE FOR NUMBER FOUR FISCAL HEALTH SPECIALISTS AND FIFTEEN AND SIXTEEN FOR SENIOR COUNTY. IN POSITIONS -- WE MAINTAIN OUR REQUEST FOR ADDITIONAL POSITIONS LARGELY -- TO REALLY HELP OUR AGENCY SUPPORTER COLLEGES AND IMPROVING. OUTCOMES CLOSING ACHIEVEMENT GAPS CONSIST OF THE VISION FOR SUCCESS HAPPY TO TALK ABOUT THAT MORE. IN THE FUTURE IF YOU'D LIKE OUR SECOND REQUEST IS RELATED TO THE USE OF LOCAL ASSISTANCE FUNDS FOR STATEWIDE NEEDS. ARE WHEN THE LEGISLATURE HAS CREATED SOME CATEGORICAL PROGRAMS FUNDS FOR PARTICULAR PURPOSES IT'S ALLOWED OUR OFFICE TO CONTRACT WITH DISTRICTS TO USE SOME OF THE FUNDS TYPICALLY A SET PERCENTAGE. FOR STATEWIDE SUPPORT ADMINISTRATION OVERSIGHT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THE TERMS VERY ACROSS PROGRAMS WHAT WE'VE PROPOSED. BRING THOSE FUNDS TOGETHER. HOW TO ENABLE OUR OFFICE TO MORE STRATEGICALLY USE THE FUNDS IN SUPPORT OF THE COLLEGES -- IMPROVEMENT UNDER THE VISION FOR SUCCESS AND DOWN I WILL. WE'VE INCLUDED THE DETAILS THERE FOR YOU -- HAPPY TO TALK ABOUT THAT IN THE FUTURE IF YOU'D LIKE. WELL IT WILL ANYBODY ELSE. COULD ANYBODY OUT. OBVIOUSLY INFORMATION SECURITY IS A KEY ISSUE. NO DOUBT PARTICULARLY IN YOUR CASE PARTICULARLY. GIVEN THE GOVERNOR'S INTEREST IN THE ADMINISTRATION'S INTEREST AND AND THE LONGITUDINAL -- DATA SYSTEM. YOU MAY HAVE MORE DATA IT NEEDS TO BE PROTECTED NO QUESTION IT'S A HOLD OPEN ITEM BUT WE WILL REVISIT IT. NEXT WEEK I HAVE OVER. ALL CONCERNS ABOUT MANNING AND STAFFING IN THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. THAT ARE TIED IN PART TO THE NEXT AGENDA ITEM WHICH I I I KNOW THAT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE ROUGH WILL NOT BE ABLE TO STAY FOR AT LEAST THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING. YOU WILL HAVE A COMMUNITY CULTURE UP HERE MAY OR SOMEONE ELSE THE PERFECT YES I HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT STAFFING ABOUT MANNING IN THE ABILITY. TO FULFILL RESPONSIBILITIES AT EITHER WE'VE ASSIGNED YOU WERE THAT YOU HAVE A SIGNED. FROM OTHERS. Q. I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE A ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FORTY FOUR POSITIONS IN THE CHANCE IN THE SYSTEM OFFICE CORRECT. HUNDRED AND FORTY THREE POINT FIVE I GUESS. HAS -- AND I THIS THIS PIECE OF PAPER THAT I HAVE IN FRONT OF ME HIS -- THE EIGHTEEN NEW POSITIONS LISTED ON THERE. SO WHEN'S THE LAST TIME THE COMMITTEE BECAUSE CHANCES OFFICE IS DONE A JUST AN OVERALL MANPOWER STUDY. TO DETERMINE WHETHER EXISTING STAFF OR YOUR APPROPRIATELY SIZED FOR THE FUNCTIONS YOU HAVE WITH YOU NEED MORE WHETHER YOU NEED FEWER POSITIONS. I'VE SEEN THE BCP PROCESS AND THAT DOESNT. RISE TO THE LEVEL OF A MAN PAR STUDY. AS I UNDERSTAND IT YEAH. IT DOES NOT SO. SO WHEN CHANCELLOR OAKLEY CAME IN TWO YEARS AGO -- FOLLOWING HIS -- APPOINTMENT AS CHANCELLOR WE DID A REVIEW OF THE AGENCY REALLY FOCUSED ON FIGURING OUT HOW DO WE ADJUST OUR POSITIONS REALLOCATE OUR POSITIONS WITHIN THE EXISTING AUTHORITY SO -- YOU KNOW HE WAS ESPECIALLY INTENT IN MAKING SURE THAT WE WERE MANAGING THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE APPROPRIATELY -- THAT OUR POSITION AUTHORITY EXCEEDED THE ABILITY FOR US -- TO TO FUNDED GIVEN THE EXISTING STATE RESOURCE SAYS AND WINE TO MAKE SURE THAT GIVEN THOSE LIMITATIONS -- WE WERE ALLOCATING OUR POSITIONS ARE EXISTING POSITIONS TO THE AREAS OF THE OFFICE WHERE THEY WERE MOST CRITICAL NEED SO THIS WAS NOT A CERTAINLY A MANPOWER STUDY. AS I WOULD IMAGINE AND I THINK AS YOU WOULD IMAGINE IT BUT ESSENTIALLY TO SAY LET'S FREEZE THE HIRING WHERE WE CURRENTLY ARE FIGURE OUT HOW MANY VACANCIES WE HAVE. AND THEN FIGURE OUT WHICH WE CAN FIND IN WHERE WE SHOULD PUT THOSE MOST STRATEGICALLY SO THAT'S PROBABLY THE CLOSEST THING WE'VE GOTTEN TO THAT TYPE OF STUDY. WE'VE WORKED WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE OVER MANY YEARS TO DO SIMILAR WORK TO TRY TO IDENTIFY OUR NEEDS. THIS RECALL YOUR FOLLOWS ON A AN INTENT TO PRIORITIZE WHAT WE CAN FUND -- WITH OUR STATE OPERATIONS DOLLARS BUT AGAIN I WOULD HIGHLIGHT THE THE POINT -- KIND OF OUR SECOND PROPOSAL RELATED TO MORE STRATEGIC USE OF LOCAL ASSISTANCE FUNDS WE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF RESOURCES GOING TO THE INSTITUTIONAL EFFECTIVENESS PARTNERSHIP INITIATIVE. GOING TO BE SET ASIDE FROM CATEGORICAL PROGRAMS -- YOU KNOW THE CHANCELLOR BELIEVES THAT TO THE EXTENT WE COULD USE THOSE DOLLARS MORE STRATEGICALLY THAT WE COULD BEGIN TO RESOURCE THE STATE WIDE EFFORTS. INA WAY THAT COULD BETTER SUPPORT OUR COLLEGES MEETING THEIR GOALS WELL I'M CONCERNED THAT THE IT. PERHAPS BECAUSE OF MANNING DEFICIENCIES. THAT THE SYSTEM OFFICES UNABLE TO PROPERLY. MANAGE SOME OF THE PROGRAMS THAT THAT I TO THE GOVERNOR ADMINISTRATION OF PUT IN THE BUDGET OR THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS FUNDED. WITH THE GOVERNOR'S SUPPORT YEAH -- AS WE WILL GET INTO WHEN WE GET TO THE NEXT ISSUE AND IF THAT'S TIED TO MANNING SHORTFALLS IT SEEMS TO ME THAT WE NEED. TO PUT A MANNING. THE TEAM MEMBERS SURVEY TEAM INTO THE SYSTEM OFFICE TO FIND OUT WHO'S DOING WHAT. AND WHEN. AND WHETHER YOU NEED TEN MORE FIFTEEN MORE OR FIFTEEN LESS -- I CAME OUT OF THE MILITARY AND UNFORTUNATELY WE HAD THOSE WITH SOME REGULARITY AND SOMETIMES YOU ONE AND SOMETIMES YOU LOST BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY YOU KNEW. WHAT YOU WERE GOING TO DO AND YOU YOU HAD? JOB THAT YOU WERE EXPECTED TO DO SO. WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO CRACK THIS NOT I UNDERSTAND IT'S NOT PROP NINETY EIGHT IT'S FUNDED OF THE GENERAL FUND. BUT IF WE'RE GOING TO HAVE YOUR OPERATION -- THEN WE NEED TO FUNDED PROPERLY. AND IF WE'RE NOT GONNA HAVE FOR NEGATIVE FUNDED PROPERLY THEN. WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT ANOTHER WAY TO DO IT. I I RECOGNIZE THESE KINDS OF STUDIES GENERALLY ARE RISKY BUT I THINK WE WOULD BE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF IT BECAUSE I THINK WE WOULD -- I THINK WE WOULD DEMONSTRATE THAT -- UNDER CURRENT PRACTICES WE ARE HAVING TO PRIORITIZE BETWEEN WHERE WE SPEND OUR YOU KNOW TIME AND ENERGY AND PERSONAL RESOURCES. ON CERTAIN THINGS OBVIOUSLY ABOUT WE THINK ARE CLOSELY LINKED TO THE VISION FOR SUCCESS OR WHERE WE ARE PUTTING OUR PERSONAL DOLLARS TODAY THERE LIKELY OTHER ACTIVITIES THAT WE COULD BE DOING THAT -- WE HAVE DE EMPHASIZE BECAUSE THEY ARE LESS -- BECAUSE OF THE LIMITED RESOURCES AND THEY'RE LESS CLOSELY ALIGNED WITH THE VISION. WELL I DON'T WANT TO BELABOR THIS BUT WE PROBABLY SHOULD EXPLORE WHETHER THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE INTERNALLY HAS THE CAPABILITY OF DOING THAT SORT OF ASSESSMENT OR WHETHER WE NEED TO LAUNCH THE STATE AUDITOR OVER THERE AND LET THE STATE AUDITOR DO THE THEY'RE GONNA BE NERVOUS. MAN FOR A STUDY BUT WE NEED TO DO IT BECAUSE MEASURE BECAUSE AS YOU WILL NOTE WE NEED TO WE NEED TO FIX THE THINGS IN THE NEXT ISSUE AS WE GET THEIR CENTER LIVE ANY QUESTIONS. ANYTHING ELSE ON THIS. ONE THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION AGAIN IT'S A HOLD OPEN ITEM WE WILL REVISIT IT NEXT WEEK [inaudible] SO.

AND THEN -- THAT INFORMATION CAN BE USED TO HELP GUIDE THE LEGISLATURE'S DECISION ON THE APPROPRIATE FUNDING LEVEL. AGENDA NOTES ON PAGE. I THINK IT'S THIRTY TWO UNLIKE COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND CSU YOU SEE HAS ITS OWN. A LEGAL SERVICE CENTER ITS OWN PROVIDER WHICH IS THROUGH UC DAVIS LAW SCHOOL. AND THUS DOES NOT GO THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICES FOR LEGAL SERVICES FOR IMMIGRANTS. BASED ON OUR CONVERSATIONS WITH YOU SEE YOU SEE LIKELY WILL NOT SPEND ITS CURRENT YEAR APPROPRIATION BY THE END OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TWENTY WE DISAGREE WITH THE GOVERNOR THAT THE STATE APPROPRIATION -- IS NOT NEEDED -- CURRENTLY -- AND IN ORDER FOR YOU SEE TO SUSTAIN ITS LEGAL SERVICE PROGRAM IN THE BUDGET YEAR. WE ALSO HAVE -- RECOMMENDATION THE UC REPORT NEXT SPRING ON ITS WORKLOAD WHAT IT SEEN ON THE GROUND IT'S OPERATIONAL COSTS. TO HELP THE LEGISLATURE IDENTIFY APPROPRIATE FUNNY LEVEL IN THE OUT YEARS. AND MOVING FORWARD WE ALSO RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDER THE PROS AND CONS OF HAVING YOU SEE DELIVER ITS OWN LEGAL SERVICES AT A MOST OF ITS CAMPUSES AS OPPOSED. TO HAVING THE DEPARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICES TO DELIVER THE SERVICES WHICH IS -- ADMINISTER THE THE PROGRAM WHICH IS AFTER ALL THE THE WAY THAT THEY'RE GOING FORWARD FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND CSU. OF COURSE YOU SEE HAS A SERIES OF LAW SCHOOLS AND PROGRAMS THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO YOU SEE THAT ARE NOT AVAILABLE TO THE OTHER. EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS SO I DON'T KNOW WHY WE WOULD. NOT INVOLVE THE UC LAW SCHOOLS IN THE FACULTY AND THE STUDENTS AND THE REST IN THIS PROCESS. AND TURN IT OVER TO AN AGENCY THAT'S PROBABLY NOT. AS WELL EQUIPPED. TO RUN A LEGAL SERVICES DELIVERY SYSTEM. SO YOU'LL HEAR FROM THE DEPARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICES THAT THEY ADMINISTER PRETTY LARGE LEGAL SERVICE. PROGRAM -- CONTRACTING WITH A NUMBER OF NONPROFIT LEGAL SERVICE PROVIDERS TO PROVIDE SERVICES THROUGHOUT THE STATE SO. THAT IS A PRETTY ESTABLISHED PROGRAM JUST BE TAKING A LOOK AT COSTS THE COST STRUCTURE. WHETHER QUALITY COST IS DIFFERENT BETWEEN DEPARTMENTS SOCIAL SERVICES AND HOW THAT PROGRAM IS ADMINISTERED VERSUS HOW YOU SEE. ADMINISTERS ITS PROGRAM WELL SOMEBODY'S GONNA HAVE YOU DO AS LA -- DONE A STUDY ON THAT NOW SOMEBODY'S GOING TO HAVE TO DO A STUDY ON THAT. TO CONVINCE ME BUT RIGHT I'M OF TRY TO KEEP AN OPEN MIND SO IF WE IN FACT RE DIRECT MONEY OR OR DO NOT FUND -- AS OF AS ORIGINALLY PROPOSED. IF THE CASE LOAD OR THE WORKLOAD IS HIGHER THAN ANTICIPATED I ASSUME THAT THESE EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS COULD COME BACK MID YEAR FOR OF BUDGETARY ADJUSTMENT. THAT'S THAT'S AN OPTION -- SOMETHING LIKE KEEP IN MIND IS THAT. THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES IS ENTERED INTO CONTRACTS FOR CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY SERVICES. AND SO THEY HAVE A TOTAL OF A REMINDER SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS. THAT. IN CURRENT YOUR MONEY IT'S AGAIN ON SPENT TO GOING INTO THE BUDGET YEAR. WHAT DAVID WHAT THEY'VE ENTERED IN THESE CONTRACTS WITH THESE SERVICE PROVIDERS? TOTALS ABOUT TWO AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE BUDGET YEAR. LEAVING THEM ABOUT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS OF FOR THE FOLLOWING YEAR NOW IF. IF -- WHAT DSS FOUND ON THE GROUND IT CSU CAMPUSES WITH THAT WAS THAT THERE WAS A TREMENDOUS NEED? AND THAT THE LEVEL OF FINE THE LEVEL OF FUNDING AND STAFFING WAS INAPPROPRIATE DSS ALREADY HAS THE AUTHORITY TO TAKE THE ONEY THEY ASSUMED WAS GOING TO BE SPENT IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND MOVE IT FORWARD TO NINETEEN TWENTY PERFECT THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I WOULD WANT. TO HEAR BECAUSE IF THERE IS A NEED I DON'T WANT TO NEED TO GO ON MATT. IN THIS AREA IT'S PRETTY CRITICAL AREA IN A VERY. IMPORTANT ONE I KNOW TO MY COLLEAGUES. TO IN THIS BUILDING THAT YES THANK YOU FOR YOUR YOUR COMMENTS WHO'S NEXT. YOU SEE YES I'VE BEEN NOMINATED -- THROUGH THE STRAW. THANK YOU TO OUR AWESOME MEMBERS OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY. TO DISCUSS THE-UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AND DOCUMENTS STUDENT LEGAL SERVICES WITH YOU TODAY I'M GOING TO KEEP MY PRESENTATION QUITE SHORT TODAY. ARE RECOGNIZING THE GROWING NEED FOR LEGAL SERVICES ON UC CAMPUSES BEGINNING IN TWENTY FIFTEEN UC PRESIDENT APOLLO TANO PROVIDED FUNDING FOR LOW FOR A LEGAL CENTER AT UC DAVIS. THE CENTER OPENS WITH FOR STAFF AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR A PARALEGAL IN TO LEGAL HELLO. IT QUICKLY BECAME APPARENT THAT THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL OF NEED -- FORTY SERVICES IN THE UC COMMUNITY BETWEEN THE CENTER'S OPENING AND JUNE TWENTY EIGHTEEN ANNUAL GREAT CASELOAD GROUP BY THREE HUNDRED AND 40%. FROM INITIALLY THREE HUNDRED ELEVEN CASES TO ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SEVEN CASES IN. SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN I'M BY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN USE YOUR P. SUPPORT FOR IMMIGRANT LEGAL SERVICES CENTER HAD GROWN TO NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS ANNUALLY WE HAVE. WITH FOUR CAMPUSES MATCHING CONTRIBUTIONS BY UNDING LAWYERS ON THEIR OWN CAMPUSES. I IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN THE LEGISLATURE GENEROUSLY PROVIDED A FOUR MILLION DOLLAR. ALLOCATION FOR YOU SEE ON DOCUMENTS STUDENTS STAFF AND FACULTY LEGAL SERVICES. WE WILL BEGIN EXPENDITURES FROM WHEN DO YOU SEE OKAY FUNDS RUN OUT -- WITH STARTING AT A ONE POINT THREE MILLION ANNUALLY. SO WILL SPEND IT OVER THREE YEARS AND IF WE'RE GOING TO BE RUNNING OUT OF FUNDS IT'LL BE IN THE THIRD YEAR WE WOULD RETURN TO YOU TO DISCUSS. UP FURTHER ALLOCATIONS OF THE STATE FUNDS WILL ALLOW THE IMMIGRANTS SERVICES CENTER TO FUND ELEVEN STAFF FOR ALLOCATED WHO ARE LOCATED THE CAMPUSES. THE GROWTH IN THE NUMBER OF CASES SHOWS THAT THERE'S A GREAT DEAL OF NEED FOR THESERVICES. FOR STUDENTS AND UNCERTAIN IMMIGRATION STATUS TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE BY HELPING STUDENTS TO ACCURATELY FILED HER PAPERWORK AND PROCESS THEIR CASES WERE ASSISTING THE MOST VULNERABLE IN OUR COMMUNITY WHO HAVE PROVEN THAT THEY HAVE A GREAT. CITY TO POSITIVELY CONTRIBUTE TO OUR COMMUNITIES. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL PROPOSAL PROVIDES CONTINUITY OF SERVICES AND WE REQUEST THAT YOU SUPPORT THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISED BUDGET FOR YOU SEE IMMIGRANT LEGAL SERVICES. THAT'S THE FUNDING STARTING IN -- TWENTY TWO PERFECT. THANK YOU [inaudible] THIS MAN. GOOD AFTERNOON TERRA SENATOR LEYVA MY NAME IS KERRY READ THAT I AM THE ASSISTANT VICE CHANCELLOR AND CHIEF COUNSEL OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS AT CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY. WITH ME TODAY AND AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS IS DOCTOR ANNA AGUAYO BRYANT ASSISTANT DIRECTOR OF STUDENT PROGRAMS. AS PART OF OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS BOTH DOCTOR ACQUIRE BRYANT AND I HAVE WORKED IN CLOSE COLLABORATION WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES CONCERNING THE SEVEN MILLION DOLLAR APPROPRIATION TO DSS. TO PROVIDE DIRECT LEGAL SERVICES TO PERSONS ON CSU CAMPUSES. FROM THE INITIATION OF THIS PROJECT CSU HAS ENGAGED CAMPUS LEADERSHIP AND KEY STAFF AND ASSESSING THE NEEDS OF STUDENTS TO DETERMINE THE PRIORITY OF SERVICES. AND WE CONVEYED THIS INFORMATION TO DSS TO HELP DESIGN A LEGAL SERVICES MODEL SPECIFICALLY TAILORED TO MEET THE NEEDS OF OUR CAMPUS COMMUNITIES. I AM PLEASED TO REPORT THAT FOR LEGAL SERVICE PROVIDERS HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED TO DELIVER DIRECT LEGAL SERVICES AT TWENTY OF THE TWENTY THREE CSU CAMPUSES. DSS CONTINUES TO SEARCH FOR A PROVIDER ON THE CENTRAL COAST TO DELIVER SERVICES TO THE MONTEREY BAY AND SAN LUIS OBISPO CAMPUSES. A PROVIDER WILL NOT BE ASSIGNED TO THE CAL MARITIME CAMPUS. STUDENTS AND STAFF AT THESE CAMPUSES WILL BE INVITED TO LEGAL SERVICE OFFENSE AT NEIGHBORING CAMPUSES WILL BE PROVIDED OTHER SUPPORT. LEGAL SERVICES ARE BEING ROLLED OUT REGION. THEY ALSO RESERVE ARE BEING ROLLED OUT BY REGION ON DIFFERENT SCHEDULES OVER THE NEXT FEW MONTHS. AND SOME ARE ALREADY IN PLACE. WE'RE WORKING CLOSELY WITH OUR CAMPUSES IN PROVIDERS TO FACILITATE THE SUCCESSFUL DELIVERY OF SERVICES ON EACH CAMPUS. WELL SERVICES WILL VERY BASED ON CAPACITY IN NEED LEGAL SERVICE PROVIDERS WILL BE ON CAMPUS ONCE OR TWICE A WEEK WITH AN ATTORNEY AND PARALEGAL FOR A FULL DAY OF APPOINTMENTS. THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE WILL ASSIST CAMPUS EFFORTS TO PROMOTE LEGAL SERVICE PROGRAMS THROUGH A VARIETY OF MEANS INCLUDING CLOSE COLLABORATION WITH CAMPUS RESOURCE CENTERS SOCIAL MEDIA AND OUR INTERNET RESOURCES RESOURCE PAGES. IN ADDITION DEVELOPING DIRECTLY CALL SERVICE PROGRAM CSU NDSS ALSO PROVIDED EDUCATION OUTREACH SUPPORT SERVICES TO OUR CAMPUSES. AFTER OUR FIRST MEETING WITH DSS WE BOTH RECOGNIZED THAT IT WAS GOING TO TAKE SOME TIME TO GET OUR LEGAL SERVICE PROGRAMS UP AND RUNNING. UP BUT WE REALIZED THAT THE NEED. FOR LEGAL SUPPORT WAS IMMEDIATE. WE CREATED A TWO TRACK PROCESS A LONG RANGE PROCESS TO DEVELOP LEGAL SERVICES. AS WELL AS AN EDUCATION AND OUTREACH PROCESS TO ADDRESS IMMEDIATE NEEDS. WE REACHED OUT TO OUR COLLEAGUES AT TE UC WHO AGREED TO HOST THREE WEBINARS ON TOPICS SELECTED BY OUR STUDENTS. THE FIRST WEB IN OUR UPDATES ON DHAKA IMMIGRATION AND YOUR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS. WAS HELD THE SAME DAY THAT THE NINTH CIRCUIT ISSUED ITS DECISION ON DHAKA. IN FACT THE DECISION CAME OUT JUST A LITTLE OVER AN HOUR BEFORE THE WEAPON ARE. SO OUR PRESENTERS WERE ABLE TO PROVIDE A VERY REAL TIME UPDATE. IN ADDITION TO BEING VERY TIMELY. THE WEAPON ARE WAS ALSO VERY WELL ATTENDED AND INCLUDED PARTICIPANTS FROM ALL TWENTY THREE CSU CAMPUSES AND MANY COMMUNITY COLLEGES. ALL THREE WEBINARS ARE POSTED ONLINE AND AVAILABLE FOR PUBLIC VIEWING. BECAUSE THE NEED FOR ACCURATE AND CURRENT INFORMATION IS CRITICAL IN AN ENVIRONMENT OF RAPID CHANGE. CSU NDSS ALSO INTEND TO CONTRACT WITH THE PROVIDER TO CREATE AN ONLINE HUB WITH UPDATED LAW AND POLICY INFORMATION. PACKAGE IN A WAY THAT'S ACCESSIBLE TO OUR STUDENT POPULATION. I WANT TO CLARIFY THAT THE LEGAL SERVICES MODEL DESIGNED BY CSU AND DSS WAS BASED ON OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT THE SEVEN MILLION DOLLAR ALLOCATION WOULD BE ONE TIME FUNDING. DSS IS NEGOTIATING TO YOUR CONTRACTS WITH PROVIDERS. AND BECAUSE OF LIMITED DURATION ARE PROVIDERS WON'T BE ABLE TO ASSIST INDIVIDUALS WITH MATTERS THAT ARE TOO COMPLICATED OR REQUIRE SRVICE THAT EXCEED THE CONTRACT PERIOD. ADDITIONAL FUNDING COULD EXPAND THE SCOPE OF THESE IMPORTANT SERVICES. CSU WAS EXTREMELY GRATEFUL FOR THE FUNDING WHAT OULD WE BELIEVE THE COST OF LEGAL SERVICE EXCEEDS THE CURRENT ALLOCATION. CSU ESTIMATES THAT WE ENROLL BETWEEN NINE TO ELEVEN THOUSAND UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS. WE ALSO NOTE THAT OUR STUDENT POPULATION IS CHANGING AND THE NUMBER OF UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS WHO DON'T HAVE DOC AS GROWING. WHICH IN TURN INCREASES THE MAGNITUDE OF THE NEED FOR DIRECTLY CALL SERVICES. AND WHILE SERVING ARE UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS IS A TOP PRIORITY. MANY STUDENTS AND EMPLOYEES WITH LAWFUL IMMIGRATION STATUS ARE ALSO VERY MUCH IN NEED OF LEGAL SERVICES. SEVERAL RECENTLY ENACTED A PROPOSED CHANGES TO FEDERAL IMMIGRATION POLICIES. DIRECTLY AFFECT INDIVIDUALS WITH LAWFUL IMMIGRATION STATUS AND ASSESS THE TATE DIRECTLY CALL SERVICES. WE'RE VERY ENCOURAGED BY THE PROPOSAL FOR RECURRING FINDING AND LOOK FORWARD TO THE OPPORTUNITY TO BETTER SERVE OUR STUDENTS AND STAFF. I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE OUR PROGRESS WITH YOU AND WELCOME ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. WELL I WOULD NORMALLY WAIT LET ME JUST ASK. ONE NOTING THE DIFFICULTY IN SECURING A CONTRACTOR FOR THE CENTRAL COAST. CHANNEL ISLANDS AND WAS OBISPO MODERATE DAY. AND IN THE IN THE INTERIM UNTIL YOU FIND ONE HAVE YOU HAD DISCUSSIONS WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA ABOUT PARTNERING. WITH THEM. ON THEIR LEGAL SERVICES PROGRAM GIVEN THE FACT THAT THERE IS A UC SANTA BARBARA. WE WE HAVEN'T HAD. A CAN DEFER TO DSS WITH IT IF THEY HAD THE DISCUSSIONS ARE CHANNELISLAND CAMPUS IS GOING TO BE COVERED THERE IF THEY HAVE BEEN ADDED TO ONE OF THE REGION SO THAT. INFORMATION THAT YOU HAVE THAT WE HAVE AN UPDATE TO THAT SO IT'S ONLY TWO CAMPUSES BUT I KNOW THAT DSS HAS REACHED OUT TO A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT PROVIDERS. WELL YOU MIGHT CHECK WITH THE LADIES SITTING NEXT TO YOU THERE IS. THERE IS A CAMPUS AT SANTA BARBARA THE LAST TIME I CHECKED NOW I REALIZE THERE'S YOU KNOW TIME AND SPACE ISSUES HAVING TO DO WITH SAN LUIS OBISPO BUT IT'S NOT ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE EARTH SO. IF WE HAVE IF WE HAVE A NEED IN THE NEED IS CRITICAL -- ON IN THE SHORT RUN WE CAN PROBABLY FIGURE OUT HOW TO MOVE THE MONEY AROUND. TOO TO PROVIDE FOR THE SERVICE IF IF THAT'S POSSIBLE I JUST WAS ASKING IF THERE'D BEEN A CONVERSATION. ABSOLUTELY I AND I CAN -- SPEAK MORE TO THAT GOOD GOOD AFTERNOON MARC MY SALARY DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES THANK YOU TERRY ROTH US ON THAT ARE LAID BACK -- I THINK IT WOULD BE IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO PROVIDE A LITTLE BIT OF CONTACTS ON THE LEGAL SERVICES PROGRAMS THAT ARE ADMINISTERED -- AND LEGAL SERVICES FUNDING THAT'S AVAILABLE. THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES -- TO UNDERSTAND THAT GROWTH IN THE DEVELOPMENT AND WHY THIS IS CURRENTLY HOUSE BUT IN SOCIAL SERVICES -- SO CURRENTLY THE DEPARTMENT IS ADMINISTERING SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR LEGAL SERVICES AND FUNDS OVER HUNDRED ORGANIZATIONS TO PROVIDE LEGAL SERVICES INCLUDING EDUCATION OUT REACH THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THIS IS A PROGRAM THAT HAS GROWN AT TWENTY FIVE FOLD OVER -- OVER A FIVE YEAR PERIOD IT STARTED WITH A THREE MILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT FOR UNACCOMPANIED MINORS. AND NOW WITH THE SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR PROGRAM THAT COVERS EVERYTHING FROM NATURALIZATION TO DOCTOR RENEWALS AND REMOVAL DEFENSE. CDSS BONDS NONPROFIT PROVIDERS IF I MENTIONED THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND TO WHEN THE PROGRAM WAS EXPANDED INTO -- HIGHER EDUCATION. FUNDING WAS AWARDED TO CDSS TO ADMINISTER BECAUSE OF THAT EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE WE ARE VERY APPRECIATIVE OF THE PARTNERSHIP WITH THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE BOTH IN COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND WITH THE CS USE. AND AS AN INITIAL ROLLOUT OF THE FUNDING WE HAD EXTENSIVE COMMUNICATION WITH THE UC SYSTEM BECAUSE WE ALSO FUND THEM FOR SOME OF THEIR LEGAL SERVICES -- THIS. PROJECT IS UNFOLDING IN -- IN A AND THE CONTACTS THAT I WOULD SAY IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND I THINK. THREE THREE ELEMENTS ONE IS THAT THIS IS ABOUT SYSTEMS INTEGRATION ON THE ONE HAND YOU HAVE THE LEGAL SERVICES PROVIDER IS INTEGRATING THEIR SERVICES WITH TWO VERY DIFFERENT SYSTEMS THE CSU. AND THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE. IT'S ALSO HAPPENING IN THE CONTEXT OF GREAT EXPANSION FOR THE LEGAL SERVICES PROVIDERS AND IT IS A SERVICE WHICH REQUIRES HIGHLY TRAINED INDIVIDUALS MAINLY LAWYERS. IT IS NOT A IT IS NOT IT A TYPE OF SERVICE THAT IT'S EASY TO EXPAND QUICKLY IT REQUIRES YES MONEY BUT IT ALSO REQUIRES TIME. AND ON TOP OF THAT THIS IS BEING ROLLED OUT IN THE CONTEXT OF RAPIDLY CHANGING IN A VERY VOLATILE HEIL. OF FEDERAL IMMIGRATION LAW AND POLICY LANDSCAPE AND SO ALL OF THOSE FACTORS HAVE TO BE CONSIDERED IN THINKING ABOUT THE TIME LINE FOR THE ROLL OUT OF OF OF THIS PROJECT. THAT SAID -- WITH THAT WITH THE CS USE WE HAVE WE ARE IN IN IN IN THE FINAL CONVERSATIONS AND WILL BE M. X. ANY CONTRACTS TO ABOUT FIVE PROVIDERS FOR OVER FIVE MILLION DOLLARS OFTHE SEVEN MILLION. DOLLARS THAT WERE ALLOCATED FOR THE CSU AND I WANT TO REITERATE SOMETHING THAT WAS SAID BY BY THE CSU. BY DESIGN -- WE HELD BACK SOME OF THE FUNDING BECAUSE IT WAS CONTEMPLATED THAT IT WAS ONE TIME FUNDING WHEN IT WAS FIRST APPROPRIATED. AND SO WE CUT IT AND THE LAST TO KNOW ONE TIME ONE YEAR IMMIGRATION PROGRAM WE WANTED TO BUILD OUT THE PROGRAM FOR MULTIPLE YEARS SO BY DESIGN WE DID HOME HEALTH. HOLD BACK SOME OF THE FUNDING OF COURSE OF THAT FUNDING BECOMES ON GOING IT CREATES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR MORE EXPANSIVE SERVICE ALSO TO EXPAND THAT. THE SCHOOL BOTH THE SCOPE IN THE BREATH OF THE SERVICE RIGHT NOW THE THE THE PROGRAM IS TARGETING LEGAL CONSULTATIONS. BUT WITH ADDITIONAL FUNDING WE COULD CONTEMPLATE EXPANDING EXPANDING THE RESOURCE TO TO ENSURE LEGAL REPRESENTATION IN MORE COMPLEX CASES. THE ORGANIZATIONS WE ARE ARE WORKING WITH OUR CONTEMPLATING HIRING NINETEEN LEGAL PROFESSIONALS THROUGHOUT THE STATE MOSTLY ATTORNEYS. TO REPRESENT INDIVIDUALS TWO OF THEM ARE EXPANDING -- ARE EXPANDING IN OPENING UP NEW OFFICES ONE HERE IN SACRAMENTO ANOTHER IN SAN BERNADINE NOW. AND AS AS THE CSU MENTIONED THIS IS A PROJECT THAT IS BEING PHASED IN SO THE INITIAL STAGES WERE EDUCATION AND NOW REACH NOW WE ARE ROLLING OUT THE LEGAL SERVICES. AS WE COLLECT MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE NEEDS OF ON THE CAMPUSES THEN WE CAN ADJUST THE CONTRACTS TO ENSURE MAYBE GREATER SCOPE OR OR BREATH AND IN TERMS OF THE REPRESENTATION. THAT COMMUNITY COLLEGE A NEGOTIATIONS ARE ONGOING WE ARE CONTEMPLATING THAT SOME OF THE VERY SAME SERVICE PROVIDERS THAT ARE GOING TO BE DELIVERING THE PROGRAM ON THE CSU CAMPUSES WILL ALSO BE DELIVERING THAT PROGRAMS WITHIN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES NOW THAT WE HAVE A DESIGN THAT WE HAVE A PROG PROGRAM DESIGN WE WE CAN ASK FOR EXPANSION OF OF OF SERVICES ON THOSE CAMPUSES BUT IT IS GOING TO TAKE A MUCH MORE LOCALIZED IN REGIONAL APPROACH WITH THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES. WITH THE CSU WE WERE ABLE TO HAVE MORE OF A TOP DOWN APPROACH IN TERMS OF WORKING WITH THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. WITH THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES WE ARE WORKING IN PARTNERSHIP ON THE GROUND WITH THE WITH THE COLLEGES AND WE HAVE AN EVENT ON MAY SEVENTEENTH IN SAN DIEGO TO SPEAK TO THOSE LOCAL COLLEGES. AND PLAN TO MOVE ON TO TO THE LA REGION CENTRAL CENTRAL VALLEY AND UP. HOW DO YOU SURE WAS A QUALITY CONTROL PROCESS IN THIS ABSOLUTELY YOU HAVE A ZERO TURNING YOUR GROUP OF ATTORNEYS ON STAFF OF [inaudible] TO ASSESS THE WELL ACTUALLY I AM AN ATTORNEY SO I OVERSEE THE PROGRAM -- AND SHOULD HAVE HEARD FOR ONE PERSON. TO OVERSEE ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE FIVE OR SIX PROVIDERS AND CORRECTLY OVERSEE ONE HUNDRED PROVIDERS -- WITH IT WITH THE DSS FUNDING THERE'S THAT THERE'S A SERIES OF A CONSUMER PROTECTIONS THAT WERE BUILT INTO THE INTO THE CODE -- REQUIRING AT A CERTAIN LEVEL OF EXPERIENCE OF OUR PROVIDERS -- WE ALSO A SASS THE QUALITY OF THE SERVICE -- BY VERIFYING BY VERIFYING -- ANY CONSUMER COMPLAINTS OR PARK-COMPLAINTS AGAINST ANY OF THE PROVIDERS WE CONDUCT SITE VISITS WITH OR PROVIDERS TO ALSO ENSURE THE QUALITY THE QUALITY OF THE WORK CASE FILE REVIEW CASE POVERTY CORRECT THANK YOU. THANK YOU CHRISTMAS MANY AGAIN WITH THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES -- WE ARE EXCITED ABOUT THIS CONVERSATION THIS IS A PLACE WHERE A CHANCE LOCALLY AGAIN. I THINK HIS -- YOU KNOW REALLY FELT THAT THERE IS A NEED FOR STRONG STATE AND HIGHER EDUCATION LEADERSHIP PARTICULARLY GIVEN. THE UNCERTAINTY THAT OUR STUDENTS SPACE AND WE HAVE A TREMENDOUS NEED IN OUR SYSTEM. THE ANSWER TO YOUR THAT THEY FACE GIVE AND JUST FEDERAL ENVIRONMENT. WE HAVE LARGELY PLAYED FOR THE THE TEN MILLION INCLUDED IN THE EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUDGET A SUPPORTIVE ROLE TO THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES. HAS YOUR LIKELY AWARE THE STATUTE ASSIGNED TO THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE THE ROLE OF SELECTING A LOCAL COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT TO SEND THE MONEY. TO THAT DISTRICT THAT HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF CONTRACTING WITH DSS. TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO THE SYSTEM AS A WHOLE. SO AFTER CONVERSATIONS -- WITHIN THE SYSTEM WE SELECTED LOS ANGELES COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT. IN LARGE PART BECAUSE THEY ARE BOTH CHAMPIONS OF THIS ISSUE CHANCELLOR FRANCISCO RODRIGUEZ A LONG BEACH COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT HAS BEEN A CHAMPION ON ON THESE ISSUES. AND THEY AGREED TO ADMINISTER THE FUND TRANSACTION. WITHOUT ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS AND SO WE'VE DISTRIBUTED THE MONEY TO LA CCD LA CCD HAS ENTERED INTO A CONTRACT WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES. DEPARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICES IS ADMINISTERING THE PROGRAM. TO YOUR ONCE IN THE LAST PANEL I WOULD JUST SAY -- CAN I THINK THIS IS NOT AN AREA WHERE THE CHANCES OFFICES BEEN RESOURCE FOR WORK. RELATED TO A LEGAL SERVICES FOR UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS. AND SO WE DON'T HAVE A BUILT UP CAPACITY IN THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE BUT AGAIN THIS IS BUT AN AREA THAT THE CHANCELLOR. NO REALLY THINKS IS IMPORTANT FOR OUR SYSTEM TO TAKE A LEADERSHIP ROLE IN THE CONVERSATION. THE FOUNDATION FOR THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES WHICH IS AN AUTHORIZED FOUNDATION AND AUXILIARY OF OUR OFFICE. HAS REALLY DONE A LOT OF THE WORK SUPPORTED BY PHILANTHROPIC FUNDS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THAT THESE ISSUES. I'VE PASSED OUT A REPORT THAT WAS PRODUCED EARLIER THIS YEAR -- AS A RESULT OF A DREAMERS PROJECT THAT WAS LED AGAIN BY OUR FOUNDATION -- WITH SUPPORT OF THE JAMES IRVINE FOUNDATION. OF THAT REALLY DID A LOT OF THE LANDSCAPE STUDENTS WHERE DO WE HAVE CENTERS WHAT ARE THE THE STAFFING RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO THE STUDENTS WHAT ARE KIND OF WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE STUDENTS NEEDS. I THINK YOU KNOW TO THE CONVERSATION ABOUT. THIS BEING A SYSTEMS INTEGRATION PROJECT I THINK A LARGE PART OF OUR ROLE HAS BEEN TO DO THIS KIND OF WORK AND TO SUPPORT THE DEPARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICES. AND BETTER UNDERSTANDING WHAT THE INFRASTRUCTURE IS AVAILABLE AT THE COLLEGES -- AND IN ORDER FOR THEM TO OUR FOCUS THEIR LEGAL SERVICES JUST SOME QUICK FINDINGS FROM THE REPORT. THIRTY FIVE OF OUR HUNDRED FIFTEEN COLLEGES CURRENTLY HAVE TREE RESOURCE CENTERS. OF THOSE THIRTY FIVE NINETEEN HAVE STAFF THAT ARE DEDICATED. TO THAT PROJECT I'LL SPECIFICALLY WITH REGARD TO LEGAL SERVICES SIXTY FIVE COLLEGES OFFER REFERRALS TO RELIABLE LEGAL SOURCES SEVENTEEN COLLEGES PROVIDE LEGAL SERVICES CURRENTLY ON THEIR CAMPUSES. TEN HAVE SCREENING ANOTHER TRIAGE SERVICES. AND THEN SIX HAVE COLLABORATIONS WITH LOCAL LAW SCHOOLS. I'M IN SO I WOULD SAY YOU KNOW TO THE EXTENT THAT. SO WE THINK IT MAKES SENSE HOW THIS PROGRAM HAS BEEN ADMINISTERED CURRENTLY TO THE EXTENT OF THEIR ONGOING FUNDS AS PER BY THE GOVERNOR. YOU KNOW IF WE'RE COMFORTABLE THAT EXISTING FRAMEWORK. IF THE LEGISLATURE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE US -- OUR OFFICE BUT YOUR GREATER ROLE -- YEAH I THINK TO YOUR CONVERSATION A CENTER I THINK THINK WE WE WOULD WANT TO HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT ARE THE TYPES OF RESOURCES OUR OFFICE WOULD NEED IN ORDER TO ADMINISTER THE PROGRAM BUT I THINK. WE THINK THE PROGRAM. WE ARE COMFORTABLE -- THAT IT'S BEING ADMINISTERED EFFECTIVELY -- BY DSS -- PARTNERSHIP WERE OFFICE AND WE ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT CONTINUED COLLABORATION. WELL THE REASON I MADE THE COMMENTS I DID AMONG OTHERS INCLUDING THE ISSUES HAVING TO DO WITH WHETHER OR NOT WE HEARD PEOPLE IN UNDER THE OTHER ISSUE. AND COULD TRACK OF HAS TO DO WITH THE COMMENTS IN OUR ANALYSIS THAT THE CHANCES OFFICE TRANSFERRED AUTHORITY COMMUNITY COLLEGE. OFFERING ME COACH FOUNDATION WHICH I ASSUME IS A FIVE OH ONE C. THREE IT IS BUT I I WOULD JUST WANT TO CLEARLY THAT'S TRUE THAT'S AN ACCURATE AND IN FACT THE AUTHORITIES TRANSFERRED -- ALONG LOS ANGELES COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND IT WHICH IS CAN SYSTEM OF THE SO THE STATUTE VERY EXPLICITLY DIRECTS OUR OFFICE TO SELECT A COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT WHICH WE'VE DONE. AND YOU THOUGHT AND CONSISTENT A STATUTE LA'S CCD HAS CONTRACTED WITH DSS I THINK THE CONFUSION MIGHT BE AROUND. THE FACT THAT THE FOUNDATION HAS TAKEN THE LEAD ON BETTER UNDERSTANDING THESE ISSUES AND I THINK THAT IS REALLY -- MAYBE TO YOUR POINT -- INDICATIVE OF RESOURCES THAT GIVEN CHANCELLOR -- PLEASE. THE LEVEL OF IMPORTANCE IS PLACED ON THIS ISSUE. NO I THINK WE WE DECIDED WE NEEDED TO DO SOMETHING ON THESE ISSUES -- WE YOU KNOW WE HAVE A LARGE COUNTRY WERE POPULATION IN THE SYSTEM. AND SO WE'VE WORKED TO GENERATE PHILANTHROPIC DOLLARS ARE MECHANISM FOR COLLECTING PHILANTHROPIC DOLLARS THIS THROUGH THAT FOUNDATION AND SO THEY'VE REALLY -- BUILT UP THE CAPACITY IN THE SHORT TERM AT LEAST OUT TO DO THE KIND OF WORK -- INCLUDING THE REPORT THAT WE'VE. PASSED OUT I HAVE NO TROUBLE WITH FOUNDATIONS DOING STUDIES AND PROVIDING THEM TO GOVERNMENT INSTITUTIONS SO THAT WE CAN IMPROVE OUR PROCESSES I WAS JUST CONCERNED. ABOUT HAVING MONEY MANAGED BY A NON GOVERNMENT ENTITY ON A ON AN ISSUE THAT WE THINK IS AN EXTREMELY SERIOUS ONE AND THAT'S NOT THE CASE YOU'VE CORRECTED THAT SO I'M FINE. ANYTHING ELSE EXCELLENT PRESENTATION BY THE WAY LET ME ASK ONE OTHER QUESTION. THAT'S THE PROBLEM WITH BEING A LAWYER -- WHAT'S THE RIVER WHAT'S THE REPORTING REQUIREMENT AND FREQUENCY. WITH RESPECT TO CASELOAD -- NUMBERS OF STUDENTS SERVICED. IF IF I SHOULD KNOW THAT I DON'T. SURE SURE NO PROBLEM. SO GENERALLY ALL OF OUR CONTRACTORS HAVE QUARTERLY REPORTING REQUIREMENTS -- WHERE THEY PROVIDE INFORMATION ON THE NUMBERS OF INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE BEEN SERVED IN THE TYPES OF REMEDIES WHICH? HAVE BEEN ASSISTED IN ADDITION TO EITHER THE SITE VISIT OR AT DUSK REVIEW WHERE THEY PROVIDE THE CASE INFORMATION WE REVIEW THE CASE FILES. SO ON SOME BASIS AYE ASSUMES AT LEAST THE GENERIC VERSION OF THE DATA YOU COULD PROVIDE TO OF COMMITTEE STAFF. ONCE THE CONTRACTS HAVE BEEN EXECUTED AND THERE'S THE START THE REPORTING PROCESS UP. WE CERTAINLY ON AN ANNUAL BASIS POPULAR REPORT. ABSOLUTELY. AND YOU SEE HAS BEEN PROVIDING IT BECAUSE THEY SEE THAT IN OUR IN OUR AGENDA.
