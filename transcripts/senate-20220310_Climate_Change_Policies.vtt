00:54:44.781 --> 00:54:47.083
ADVANCED BIO FUELS ALONG WITH

00:54:47.150 --> 00:54:48.718
OTHER GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCING

00:54:48.785 --> 00:54:50.620
MEASURES IN SECTORS LIKE WASTE

00:54:50.687 --> 00:54:52.622
AGRICULTURE AND FROM OTHER

00:54:52.689 --> 00:54:54.658
SOURCES OF HIGH GLOBAL WARMING

00:54:54.724 --> 00:54:58.361
POTENTIAL GASES. IN ADDITION IN

00:54:58.428 --> 00:54:59.262
ALL OF THE CITY AREAS THAT WE

00:54:59.329 --> 00:55:01.665
EVALUATED EVEN WITH AMBITIOUS

00:55:01.731 --> 00:55:05.235
STEPS TO REDUCE FOSSIL FUEL USE

00:55:05.301 --> 00:55:08.071
. CARBON DIOXIDE REMOVAL SUCH AS

00:55:08.138 --> 00:55:10.006
LAND BASED CARBON SEQUESTRATION

00:55:10.073 --> 00:55:12.742
AND DIRECT AIR CAPTURE OF CO TWO

00:55:12.809 --> 00:55:14.377
WAS FOUND TO BE A CRITICAL

00:55:14.444 --> 00:55:15.979
STRATEGY NEEDED TO ACHIEVE

00:55:16.046 --> 00:55:18.248
CARBON NEUTRALITY. DESPITE BEING

00:55:18.314 --> 00:55:20.517
IN THE VERY EARLY STAGES OF

00:55:20.583 --> 00:55:23.253
COMMERCIALIZATION TODAY. THE

00:55:23.319 --> 00:55:24.721
STUDY SHOWED THAT ACHIEVING

00:55:24.788 --> 00:55:27.157
CARBON NEUTRALITY BY TWENTY

00:55:27.223 --> 00:55:28.525
FORTY FIVE IN CALIFORNIA

00:55:28.591 --> 00:55:30.126
REQUIRES AMBITIOUS NEAR TERM

00:55:30.193 --> 00:55:32.529
ACTIONS AROUND DEPLOYMENT AND

00:55:32.595 --> 00:55:34.397
ENERGY EFFICIENCY.

00:55:34.464 --> 00:55:35.799
TRANSPORTATION AND BUILDING

00:55:35.865 --> 00:55:38.568
ELECTRIFICATION ZERO CARBON

00:55:38.635 --> 00:55:41.237
ELECTRICITY AND REDUCTIONS IN

00:55:41.304 --> 00:55:43.440
NON ENERGY NON COMBUSTION

00:55:43.506 --> 00:55:45.909
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AS NO

00:55:45.975 --> 00:55:48.912
REGRETS STRATEGIES. IFWE LOOK

00:55:48.978 --> 00:55:51.481
BACK ON THE LAST TEN YEARS OF

00:55:51.548 --> 00:55:53.349
CLIMATE POLICY IN CALIFORNIA.

00:55:53.416 --> 00:55:55.085
ERIC LEE THE LARGEST DRIVER OF

00:55:55.151 --> 00:55:56.853
SUCCESS FOR A CHEATING

00:55:56.920 --> 00:55:58.455
CALIFORNIA'S TWENTY TWENTY

00:55:58.521 --> 00:56:01.725
CLIMATE GOALS FOR YEARS AHEAD OF

00:56:01.791 --> 00:56:02.992
SCHEDULE K. FROM GREENHOUSE GAS

00:56:03.059 --> 00:56:05.295
REDUCTIONS IN THE ELECTRIC POWER

00:56:05.361 --> 00:56:07.397
SECTOR. THIS WAS PRIMARILY

00:56:07.464 --> 00:56:08.865
DRIVEN BY THE RENEWABLE

00:56:08.932 --> 00:56:11.935
PORTFOLIO STANDARD. CRITICALLY

00:56:12.001 --> 00:56:14.838
THIS LAW CAME WITH A BUILT IN

00:56:14.904 --> 00:56:16.406
FINANCING MECHANISM. IN THE FORM

00:56:16.473 --> 00:56:18.007
OF INVESTOR AND MUNICIPALLY

00:56:18.074 --> 00:56:19.209
OWNED UTILITIES AND ELECTRIC

00:56:19.275 --> 00:56:23.880
REPAIRS. IN ADDITION BUILDING

00:56:23.947 --> 00:56:26.216
CODES AND STANDARDS RATEPAYER

00:56:26.282 --> 00:56:27.183
FUNDED ENERGY EFFICIENCY

00:56:27.250 --> 00:56:28.952
PROGRAMS AND VEHICLE FUEL

00:56:29.018 --> 00:56:31.020
ECONOMY STANDARDS HAVE ALSO BEEN

00:56:31.087 --> 00:56:33.056
CRITICAL IN REDUCING ENERGY

00:56:33.123 --> 00:56:34.991
DEMAND ACROSS THE STATE. THE LOW

00:56:35.058 --> 00:56:37.227
CARBON FUEL STANDARD AND THE CAP

00:56:37.293 --> 00:56:39.729
AND TRADE PROGRAM HAVE ALSO BOTH

00:56:39.796 --> 00:56:41.798
PROVIDED IMPORTANT INCENTIVES IN

00:56:41.865 --> 00:56:43.366
FUNDING FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLE

00:56:43.433 --> 00:56:45.635
ADOPTION AND OTHER CARBON

00:56:45.702 --> 00:56:48.171
REDUCING MEASURES. SO LOOKING

00:56:48.238 --> 00:56:50.540
FORWARD WE KNOW THAT ACHIEVING

00:56:50.607 --> 00:56:52.308
DEEPER LEVELS OF GREENHOUSE GAS

00:56:52.375 --> 00:56:54.677
REDUCTIONS WILL REQUIRE NEW

00:56:54.744 --> 00:56:56.679
COMPLEMENTARY POLICIES AND

00:56:56.746 --> 00:56:59.015
SIGNIFICANT CAPITAL INVESTMENTS

00:56:59.082 --> 00:57:01.851
ACROSS EVERY SECTOR. THE DATA

00:57:01.918 --> 00:57:03.353
ARE CLEAR THAT REDUCING

00:57:03.419 --> 00:57:04.654
EMISSIONS FROM THE ELECTRIC

00:57:04.721 --> 00:57:08.258
SECTOR ALONE WILL NOT BE IN TO

00:57:08.324 --> 00:57:09.692
MEET OUR CLIMATE GOALS. WE NEED

00:57:09.759 --> 00:57:11.694
TO FIND NEW AND CREATIVE WAYS TO

00:57:11.761 --> 00:57:13.429
SUPPORT THE COMMERCIALIZATION

00:57:13.496 --> 00:57:14.831
AND DEPLOYMENT OF ZERO CARBON

00:57:14.898 --> 00:57:18.034
TECHNOLOGIES. THE LARGEST

00:57:18.101 --> 00:57:19.102
SOURCES OF EMISSIONS IN THE

00:57:19.169 --> 00:57:20.970
STATE TODAY COME FROM PASSENGER

00:57:21.037 --> 00:57:23.373
VEHICLES. ACCELERATING THE

00:57:23.439 --> 00:57:24.407
ADOPTION OF ZERO EMISSION

00:57:24.474 --> 00:57:28.077
VEHICLES IS THEREFORE CRITICAL.

00:57:28.144 --> 00:57:29.679
WE ALSO KNOW THAT CALIFORNIA

00:57:29.746 --> 00:57:31.748
FACES A HOUSING CRISIS AND THAT

00:57:31.815 --> 00:57:33.683
BUILDING ALL ELECTRIC HOUSING IN

00:57:33.750 --> 00:57:35.952
URBAN CENTERS WITH ACCESS TO

00:57:36.019 --> 00:57:37.720
PUBLIC TRANSIT AND ELECTRIC

00:57:37.787 --> 00:57:40.023
VEHICLE CHARGING. COULD HELP

00:57:40.089 --> 00:57:41.925
REDUCE OUR RELIANCE ON PERSONAL

00:57:41.991 --> 00:57:44.227
GASOLINE POWERED VEHICLES WHILE

00:57:44.294 --> 00:57:45.662
SIMULTANEOUSLY ADDRESSING THE

00:57:45.728 --> 00:57:48.798
HOUSING SHORTAGE. CALIFORNIANS

00:57:48.865 --> 00:57:50.900
NEED BETTER ACCESS TO CLEAN AND

00:57:50.967 --> 00:57:52.869
RELIABLE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION.

00:57:52.936 --> 00:57:54.270
AND SAFE BIKING AND WALKING

00:57:54.337 --> 00:57:57.340
CORRIDORS ALONG WITH ZERO CARBON

00:57:57.407 --> 00:57:59.576
HOUSING OPTIONS. SECTOR BASED

00:57:59.642 --> 00:58:01.744
SOLUTIONS LIKE THESE AND OTHER

00:58:01.811 --> 00:58:03.179
COMPLEMENTARY POLICIES THAT

00:58:03.246 --> 00:58:06.015
SUPPORT INCENTIVES AND FUNDING

00:58:06.082 --> 00:58:07.383
FOR ACCELERATING THE CLEAN

00:58:07.450 --> 00:58:08.351
ENERGY TRANSITION THAT IS

00:58:08.418 --> 00:58:10.520
UNDERWAY WILL HELP CALIFORNIA

00:58:10.587 --> 00:58:13.489
MAKE MORE RAPID PROGRESS TOWARDS

00:58:13.556 --> 00:58:16.426
MEETING OUR CLIMATE GOALS. THE

00:58:16.492 --> 00:58:19.262
PRIMARY CHALLENGE THAT I SEE IS

00:58:19.329 --> 00:58:21.397
NOT A LACK OF AMBITION BUT A

00:58:21.464 --> 00:58:22.999
QUESTION OF HOW WE WILL FINANCE

00:58:23.066 --> 00:58:24.267
THESE NEEDED INVESTMENTS

00:58:24.334 --> 00:58:27.170
EQUITABLY. AND RAPIDLY DEPLOY IN

00:58:27.237 --> 00:58:28.838
ADOPTING NEW TECHNOLOGIES IN

00:58:28.905 --> 00:58:31.741
EVERY SECTOR. I THANK YOU FOR

00:58:31.808 --> 00:58:33.676
YOUR TIME AND ATTENTION AND I'M

00:58:33.743 --> 00:58:35.278
HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS

00:58:35.345 --> 00:58:38.114
ABOUT OUR TWENTY TWENTY CARBON

00:58:38.181 --> 00:58:39.749
NEUTRALITY STUDY THAT YOU MAY

00:58:39.816 --> 00:58:46.422
HAVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MS

00:58:46.489 --> 00:58:50.426
MAHONE. WHO WOULD LIKE TO START

00:58:50.493 --> 00:58:55.665
. THIS FLOOR. THANK YOU VERY

00:58:55.732 --> 00:58:58.134
MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION TODAY

00:58:58.201 --> 00:59:00.703
AND I THINK IT'S A VERY

00:59:00.770 --> 00:59:01.938
IMPORTANT CONVERSATION AND

00:59:02.005 --> 00:59:02.839
COMING FROM THE CENTRAL OUT

00:59:02.906 --> 00:59:05.408
WHICH IS WHY I ASK THAT YOU

00:59:05.475 --> 00:59:06.576
ALLOW ME TO BE ON THIS-

00:59:06.643 --> 00:59:08.111
COMMITTEE- AS A- ELECTED FROM

00:59:08.177 --> 00:59:10.179
STANISLAUS COUNTY SAN JOAQUIN

00:59:10.246 --> 00:59:11.748
COUNTY IN THE HEART OF THE AG

00:59:11.814 --> 00:59:13.383
COMMUNITY. I THINK IT IS

00:59:13.449 --> 00:59:14.751
IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE THESE

00:59:14.817 --> 00:59:16.085
CONVERSATIONS- AND REALLY

00:59:16.152 --> 00:59:17.487
SOMETIMES HAVE A RURAL

00:59:17.553 --> 00:59:19.355
PERSPECTIVE BECAUSE A LOT OF

00:59:19.422 --> 00:59:21.557
WHAT WE'RE TALKING. ABOUT IS

00:59:21.624 --> 00:59:22.558
KIND OF WAIT AROUND THE URBAN

00:59:22.625 --> 00:59:25.061
SETTINGS. AND I THINK IT'S A

00:59:25.128 --> 00:59:26.362
CONVERSATION THAT. AS WE MOVE

00:59:26.429 --> 00:59:28.598
FORWARD. THAT WE UNDERSTAND THE

00:59:28.665 --> 00:59:30.767
CRITICAL NATURE. OF THE CENTRAL

00:59:30.833 --> 00:59:32.902
VALLEY AND WHAT IT. PRODUCES FOR

00:59:32.969 --> 00:59:35.004
THE ENTIRE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

00:59:35.071 --> 00:59:36.239
SO I DO HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS

00:59:36.306 --> 00:59:37.941
WHAT I WOULD LOVE- JUST RE KIND

00:59:38.007 --> 00:59:39.976
OF TOUCH ON THEM AND ONE WAS

00:59:40.043 --> 00:59:41.778
ABOUT CAP AND TRADE WHICH IS

00:59:41.844 --> 00:59:42.845
SOMETHING THAT I SUPPORT. AND

00:59:42.912 --> 00:59:44.747
HAVE IN THE PAST SOMEONE TALK A

00:59:44.814 --> 00:59:46.215
LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT. AND THEN

00:59:46.282 --> 00:59:47.417
KIND OF YOUR THOUGHTS ON. YOU

00:59:47.483 --> 00:59:48.017
MENTIONED A COUPLE DIFFERENT

00:59:48.084 --> 00:59:49.519
TIMES THAT DIFFERENT

00:59:49.585 --> 00:59:50.053
TECHNOLOGIES- THEN JUST

00:59:50.119 --> 00:59:51.888
ELECTRIFICATION. SO I GUESS MY

00:59:51.955 --> 00:59:53.456
FIRST QUESTION IS- DO YOU

00:59:53.523 --> 00:59:54.891
BELIEVE IT IS IMPORTANT FOR THE

00:59:54.958 --> 00:59:55.959
STATE TO FACILITATE AND

00:59:56.025 --> 00:59:57.727
ENCOURAGE. THE USE OF CARBON

00:59:57.794 --> 01:00:01.164
CAPTURING TECHNOLOGIES TO HELP

01:00:01.230 --> 01:00:03.733
ACHIEVE OUR GHG REDUCTION GOALS%

01:00:03.800 --> 01:00:04.634
. DO WE HAVE THE STATE PLAY A

01:00:04.701 --> 01:00:06.302
ROLE IN THAT AS AS OF LIKE TO

01:00:06.369 --> 01:00:09.906
BODY. YES THEY BELIEVE THAT IT

01:00:09.973 --> 01:00:11.741
IS IMPORTANT TO HAVE ALL THE

01:00:11.808 --> 01:00:13.810
TOOLS IN OUR TOOLBOX THERE WILL

01:00:13.876 --> 01:00:15.111
NEED TO MEET THESE VERY

01:00:15.178 --> 01:00:17.113
AMBITIOUS GOALS. AND CARBON

01:00:17.180 --> 01:00:18.681
CAPTURE AND SEQUESTRATION IS ONE

01:00:18.748 --> 01:00:21.718
OF THOSE TOOLS. THAT THAT NEEDS

01:00:21.784 --> 01:00:23.953
SOME FURTHER. YOU KNOW. WE NEED

01:00:24.020 --> 01:00:26.222
REGULATORY THAT SUPPORT TO

01:00:26.289 --> 01:00:27.824
ENSURE THAT THE CARBON IS

01:00:27.890 --> 01:00:30.593
CAPTURED AND SAFELY STORED. AND

01:00:30.660 --> 01:00:32.228
BUT E ALSO NEED EFFORTS TO

01:00:32.295 --> 01:00:33.663
FURTHER COMMERCIALIZE THIS

01:00:33.730 --> 01:00:35.898
TECHNOLOGY THAT IS. IT IS NOT

01:00:35.965 --> 01:00:36.599
WIDELY COMMERCIALIZED AND

01:00:36.666 --> 01:00:38.468
DEPLOYED TODAY. RIGHT I THINK

01:00:38.534 --> 01:00:40.336
I'M LOOKING AT YOU TO STREAM SO

01:00:40.403 --> 01:00:41.337
I APOLOGIZE IF I'M LOOKING

01:00:41.404 --> 01:00:43.272
SIDEWAYS AT YOU DON'T NEED TO BE

01:00:43.339 --> 01:00:44.941
SO- AND THEN I SO APPRECIATE

01:00:45.008 --> 01:00:46.342
THAT IN IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY-

01:00:46.409 --> 01:00:48.945
IS. UNIQUELY POSITIONED WITHIN

01:00:49.012 --> 01:00:50.513
THE STATE AS WELL. TO HELP

01:00:50.580 --> 01:00:51.814
ACHIEVE SOME OF THOSE GOALS AND

01:00:51.881 --> 01:00:52.982
THE NICE PART ABOUT THIS AS FAR

01:00:53.049 --> 01:00:55.485
AS- STORAGE ON ON CAPTURING

01:00:55.551 --> 01:00:57.086
CARBON. AND THE NICE PART ABOUT

01:00:57.153 --> 01:00:59.155
OUR AREA AS WELL IS. IT PROVIDES

01:00:59.222 --> 01:01:00.957
JOBS AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR

01:01:01.024 --> 01:01:03.359
ATRIAL S. A TRAINED SKILLED AND

01:01:03.426 --> 01:01:04.961
TRAINED WORKFORCE. AND SO FOR

01:01:05.028 --> 01:01:06.062
THE MEN AND WOMEN THAT WOULD

01:01:06.129 --> 01:01:07.797
THAT ARE IN THESE INDUSTRIES I

01:01:07.864 --> 01:01:10.433
THINK IT IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY

01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:11.134
THAT WE CONTINUE TO STUDY THOSE.

01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:12.301
REALLY UTILIZE THE GEOGRAPHICAL

01:01:12.368 --> 01:01:13.803
LOCATION THE CENTRAL VALLEY AS

01:01:13.870 --> 01:01:15.038
IT RELATES TO THE CARBON

01:01:15.104 --> 01:01:16.539
CAPTURING AND THEN USE OUR-

01:01:16.606 --> 01:01:18.474
SKILLED TRAINED WORKFORCE. TO DO

01:01:18.541 --> 01:01:20.910
THAT- I MENTIONED BRIEFLY THAT I

01:01:20.977 --> 01:01:23.312
WAS A SUPPORTER OF- CAP AND

01:01:23.379 --> 01:01:24.881
TRADE WAS ONE OF THE FEW

01:01:24.947 --> 01:01:25.448
REPUBLICANS THAT ACTUALLY

01:01:25.515 --> 01:01:27.950
SUPPORTED THAT- SO THAT WAS A IT

01:01:28.017 --> 01:01:29.585
WAS A GREAT EXPERIENCE. DO YOU

01:01:29.652 --> 01:01:31.087
BELIEVE IT- IS A POINT WE TALK

01:01:31.154 --> 01:01:32.388
ABOUT ACHIEVING THESE BROADER

01:01:32.455 --> 01:01:34.490
GOALS POST TWENTY THIRTY BECAUSE

01:01:34.557 --> 01:01:38.161
I WAS A CAP AND TRADE- EXPIRES

01:01:38.227 --> 01:01:38.961
IN TWENTY THIRTY. THE WE ALSO

01:01:39.028 --> 01:01:41.064
TALKED PULSE AND PRO LIKE TAP

01:01:41.130 --> 01:01:42.999
INTO. THAT THAT WE CAN USE TO

01:01:43.066 --> 01:01:44.200
MEET THE STATE'S CLIMATE GOALS

01:01:44.267 --> 01:01:45.802
ONE OF THE BIG THINGS ABOUT CAP

01:01:45.868 --> 01:01:47.136
AND TRADE AND REASON I SUPPORTED

01:01:47.203 --> 01:01:48.838
IT. WAS BECAUSE OF INDUSTRIES

01:01:48.905 --> 01:01:51.140
INVOLVEMENT IN THAT. IF WE JUST

01:01:51.207 --> 01:01:54.143
COMPLETELY GO- OFF THE GRID OR

01:01:54.210 --> 01:01:56.045
ELECTRIFICATION OVERNIGHT. THERE

01:01:56.112 --> 01:01:58.114
IS GOING TO BE A TREMENDOUS COST

01:01:58.181 --> 01:02:00.817
AND SO A STEP DOWN APPROACH- IS

01:02:00.883 --> 01:02:02.985
CRITICAL AND I WOULD JUST LOVE.

01:02:03.052 --> 01:02:05.354
YOUR COMMENTS. CAN WE STILL

01:02:05.421 --> 01:02:07.256
ENCOURAGE INDUSTRIES TO ENGAGE

01:02:07.323 --> 01:02:09.092
WITH ALL OF YOU TO HAVE THE STEP

01:02:09.158 --> 01:02:11.060
DOWN APPROACH SO WE DON'T HAVE

01:02:11.127 --> 01:02:12.328
JUSTICE MASSIVE INCREASE THE

01:02:12.395 --> 01:02:14.063
COST OF LIVING- ACROSS THE

01:02:14.130 --> 01:02:21.537
CENTRAL VALLEY. I THINK YOU KNOW. I'M NOT QUITE SURE WHAT THE

01:02:21.604 --> 01:02:23.106
QUESTION THERE IS CAP AND TRADE

01:02:23.172 --> 01:02:26.409
IS BUT IT BEEN A VERY IMPORTANT

01:02:26.476 --> 01:02:29.579
STRATEGY FOR RAISING FUNDS TO

01:02:29.645 --> 01:02:31.681
SUPPORT OUR STATE'S CLIMATE

01:02:31.747 --> 01:02:36.152
REDUCTION EFFORTS AND- I THINK

01:02:36.219 --> 01:02:37.420
WHERE WE'RE GOING AND WE'RE

01:02:37.487 --> 01:02:38.788
STILL GOING TO NEED INCREASED

01:02:38.855 --> 01:02:40.656
AMBITION. IN THE INDUSTRIAL

01:02:40.723 --> 01:02:42.758
SECTOR FOR DECARBONISATION AND

01:02:42.825 --> 01:02:43.893
WHETHER CAP AND TRADE IS THE

01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:46.395
ONLY MECHANISM THAT WE USED TO

01:02:46.462 --> 01:02:47.563
REDUCE EMISSIONS FROM THE

01:02:47.630 --> 01:02:50.066
INDUSTRIAL SECTOR- I THINK. I

01:02:50.133 --> 01:02:51.434
THINK THERE'S A QUESTION THAT I

01:02:51.501 --> 01:02:52.869
HAVE THEIR AROUND WHETHER THAT

01:02:52.935 --> 01:02:55.371
WILL BE ENOUGH IF OUR GOAL IS

01:02:55.438 --> 01:02:56.639
TRULY DEAD CHIEF CARBON

01:02:56.706 --> 01:02:57.940
NEUTRALITY. I GUESS MY QUESTION

01:02:58.007 --> 01:03:00.643
IS- WITH ALL OF YOU STILL BE

01:03:00.710 --> 01:03:01.577
WILLING TO ENGAGE WITH

01:03:01.644 --> 01:03:03.112
INDUSTRIES TO ACHIEVE THESE

01:03:03.179 --> 01:03:04.981
GOALS ONE OF THE PROGRAMS WITHIN

01:03:05.047 --> 01:03:06.582
CAP AND TRADE WAS THE TRUCK

01:03:06.649 --> 01:03:08.050
REPLACEMENT PROGRAM WHERE WE

01:03:08.117 --> 01:03:09.852
TOOK TEARS ZERO ENGINES OUT AND

01:03:09.919 --> 01:03:11.754
WE'RE UP TO NOW TIER FIVE. AND

01:03:11.821 --> 01:03:13.389
WE WORKED WITH THE INDUSTRIES

01:03:13.456 --> 01:03:14.690
WITH THE MANUFACTURERS WITH THE

01:03:14.757 --> 01:03:16.759
DEALERSHIPS ACROSS THE STATE AND

01:03:16.826 --> 01:03:18.327
THEIR SALES MEN AND WOMEN TO

01:03:18.394 --> 01:03:20.129
DEVELOP A PROGRAM THAT THE AG

01:03:20.196 --> 01:03:22.798
COMMUNITY BOUGHT INTO. IT BECAME

01:03:22.865 --> 01:03:24.333
ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL

01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:25.067
PROGRAMS THE CARP HAS KIND OF

01:03:25.134 --> 01:03:27.837
BEEN A PART OF FOR A VERY LONG

01:03:27.904 --> 01:03:29.038
TIME AND THE COMMUNITY HAS

01:03:29.105 --> 01:03:31.407
BOUGHT INTO US I THINK. IN GAUGE

01:03:31.474 --> 01:03:32.108
MINT- AS OPPOSED TO THE MAT CARE

01:03:32.175 --> 01:03:33.342
VERSUS THE STICK APPROACH IS

01:03:33.409 --> 01:03:34.810
INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE

01:03:34.877 --> 01:03:36.245
THESE SECTORS ARE WILLING TO

01:03:36.312 --> 01:03:40.183
MOVE. BUT AT A REASONABLE PACE.

01:03:40.249 --> 01:03:42.818
SO WAS. I GUESS ARE WE STILL

01:03:42.885 --> 01:03:43.953
WILL TO ENGAGE INDUSTRIES.

01:03:44.020 --> 01:03:46.255
UNDERSTOOD I DON'T SPEAK FOR THE

01:03:46.322 --> 01:03:49.759
EMERGENCIES- BUT I WOULD IMAGINE

01:03:49.825 --> 01:03:51.694
THAT ENGAGEMENT IS A CRITICAL

01:03:51.761 --> 01:03:53.062
STRATEGY FOR ACHIEVING OUR

01:03:53.129 --> 01:03:55.398
CLIMATE GOALS. OKAY THANK YOU

01:03:55.464 --> 01:03:57.266
VERY MUCH FOR THAT AND I JUST

01:03:57.333 --> 01:03:59.335
WANTED TO SAY AS WE MOVE FORWARD

01:03:59.402 --> 01:04:01.537
IN THIS- COST OF LIVING IN

01:04:01.604 --> 01:04:03.539
CALIFORNIA- IS A TREMENDOUS

01:04:03.606 --> 01:04:05.541
CONCERN FOR MY COMMUNITY. AND

01:04:05.608 --> 01:04:07.276
WHETHER WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:04:07.343 --> 01:04:08.778
HEAVY DUTY TRUCKING AVIATION

01:04:08.844 --> 01:04:11.948
TRAINS SHIPPING- RIGHT NOW.

01:04:12.014 --> 01:04:14.217
THERE IS NOT A ELECTRIC TRACTOR

01:04:14.283 --> 01:04:16.619
OUT THERE AND WE CURRENTLY ARE

01:04:16.686 --> 01:04:18.321
THE BREAD BASKET OF THE WORLD WE

01:04:18.387 --> 01:04:19.989
GROW THE SAFEST CLEANEST

01:04:20.056 --> 01:04:21.691
PRODUCTS WE FEED AN ENTIRE

01:04:21.757 --> 01:04:24.894
NATION LARGELY AND WE SHIP A LOT

01:04:24.961 --> 01:04:26.195
OF EXPORTS INTO THE REST OF THE

01:04:26.262 --> 01:04:28.431
WORLD. SO AS WE MOVE FORWARD I

01:04:28.497 --> 01:04:29.832
WOULD JUST ENCOURAGE ALL OF US

01:04:29.899 --> 01:04:32.435
TO BE VERY VERY COGNIZANT OF

01:04:32.501 --> 01:04:35.137
THAT LIKE IF WE GO TO A

01:04:35.204 --> 01:04:37.506
RECTIFICATION INSTANTLY THERE IS

01:04:37.573 --> 01:04:39.008
GOING TO BE A TREMENDOUS COST

01:04:39.075 --> 01:04:40.843
BECAUSE AT THIS POINT AND SOME

01:04:40.910 --> 01:04:42.245
OF YOUR REPORTING LIVE ON PAGE

01:04:42.311 --> 01:04:43.879
ELEVEN OF THE REPORT. THE

01:04:43.946 --> 01:04:44.747
TECHNOLOGIES DON'T EVEN EXIST

01:04:44.814 --> 01:04:46.916
YET WE HAVEN'T GOT THERE YET SO

01:04:46.983 --> 01:04:48.517
WE HAVE TO BE VERY COGNISANT OF

01:04:48.584 --> 01:04:50.019
THAT AND I WOULD JUST ENCOURAGE

01:04:50.086 --> 01:04:51.921
ALL OF US TO KEEP THAT IN MIND

01:04:51.988 --> 01:04:53.923
AS WE MOVE FORWARD THERE IS A

01:04:53.990 --> 01:04:54.924
REAL IMPACT- TO THE MEN AND

01:04:54.991 --> 01:04:56.892
WOMEN THAT LIVE IN MY COMMUNITY-

01:04:56.959 --> 01:04:58.227
IN THE COST OF LIVING AND AT

01:04:58.294 --> 01:05:00.596
SOME POINT- WE HAVE TO BE- JUST.

01:05:00.663 --> 01:05:02.632
PROMISE OF THAT SO THANK YOU FOR

01:05:02.698 --> 01:05:04.000
YOUR TIME. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY

01:05:04.066 --> 01:05:06.102
MEMBER I WOULD AGREE WITH THE

01:05:06.168 --> 01:05:08.170
COMMENTS AS WELL. THANK YOU

01:05:08.237 --> 01:05:14.543
CENTER BACKER. THANK YOU. OKAY

01:05:14.610 --> 01:05:17.213
SO MY COMMENTS FOR THE NEXT THAT

01:05:17.280 --> 01:05:21.484
PANEL. AS WELL BUT- I JUST IN

01:05:21.550 --> 01:05:24.587
YOUR SOME SINS WHAT WERE THE

01:05:24.654 --> 01:05:33.963
HARDEST- EMISSIONS TO ELIMINATE. THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION I'M-

01:05:34.030 --> 01:05:37.700
WE SEE THE THERE ARE CHALLENGES

01:05:37.767 --> 01:05:39.835
IN EVERY SECTOR AND OFTEN

01:05:39.902 --> 01:05:44.473
GETTING THAT LAST 10% OF CARBON

01:05:44.540 --> 01:05:46.842
OUT OF ANY SECTOR BECOMES

01:05:46.909 --> 01:05:51.314
CHALLENGING- THAT SAID YOU KNOW

01:05:51.380 --> 01:05:53.149
THINKING ABOUT SPECIFIC SECTORS.

01:05:53.215 --> 01:05:57.019
WE SEE PARTICULAR CHALLENGES IN

01:05:57.086 --> 01:05:59.155
FULLY ABATING EMISSIONS FROM

01:05:59.221 --> 01:06:03.159
AVIATION. AT AND FROM OTHER OFF

01:06:03.225 --> 01:06:07.697
ROAD TRANSPORTATION- INCLUDING

01:06:07.763 --> 01:06:11.100
HEAVY DUTY SHIPPING. HEAVY DUTY

01:06:11.167 --> 01:06:14.236
TRUCKING IS ANOTHER AREA WHERE

01:06:14.303 --> 01:06:16.539
FURTHER COMMERCIALIZATION I IS

01:06:16.605 --> 01:06:21.544
NEEDED- I TEMPERATURE INDUSTRIAL

01:06:21.610 --> 01:06:24.747
PROCESS THESE MAY REQUIRE THINGS

01:06:24.814 --> 01:06:26.749
LIKE HYDROGEN WHICH IS THE

01:06:26.816 --> 01:06:28.751
AVAILABLE TECHNOLOGY BUT AGAIN

01:06:28.818 --> 01:06:31.387
NOT WIDELY COMMERCIALIZED- AND

01:06:31.454 --> 01:06:34.623
THEN OF COURSE FULLY ELIMINATING

01:06:34.690 --> 01:06:35.624
. CARBON EMISSIONS FROM THE

01:06:35.691 --> 01:06:37.760
ELECTRICITY SECTOR GETTING THAT

01:06:37.827 --> 01:06:40.463
LAST 10% WILL ALSO REQUIRE

01:06:40.529 --> 01:06:42.798
DEVELOPMENTS IN NEW TECHNOLOGIES

01:06:42.865 --> 01:06:44.834
THAT ARE NOT AVAILABLE TODAY TO

01:06:44.900 --> 01:06:47.303
PROVIDE FIRMS ARE CARBON

01:06:47.370 --> 01:06:51.073
CAPACITY. SO THERE'S CHALLENGES

01:06:51.140 --> 01:06:53.109
IN EACH SECTOR AS YOU GET ALL

01:06:53.175 --> 01:06:58.881
THE WAY OUT CLOSER TO ZERO-

01:06:58.948 --> 01:07:00.383
ANYTHING ABOUT SCENARIOS THAT

01:07:00.449 --> 01:07:02.685
CAN GET AS SOON AS YOU'RE A

01:07:02.752 --> 01:07:05.020
FASTER YOU WHAT. WE USE BIGGEST

01:07:05.087 --> 01:07:07.723
CONSTRAINTS FOR. BAD GETTING

01:07:07.790 --> 01:07:10.693
THERE FASTER IS IT. BILL RATES

01:07:10.760 --> 01:07:11.127
OF CLEAN ENERGY IS A

01:07:11.193 --> 01:07:13.195
TRANSMISSION IS IT REPLACEMENT

01:07:13.262 --> 01:07:15.097
CYCLES FOR VEHICLES AND SUCH

01:07:15.164 --> 01:07:16.999
WHAT WHAT DO YOU SEE AS THE

01:07:17.066 --> 01:07:19.602
BIGGEST- THEY ARE. CONSTRAINED

01:07:19.668 --> 01:07:22.772
THAT THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION-

01:07:22.838 --> 01:07:26.876
IT'S ALL ALL OF THOSE- I DO SEE

01:07:26.942 --> 01:07:29.645
THE REPLACEMENT CYCLE FOR

01:07:29.712 --> 01:07:32.314
EQUIPMENT INCLUDING VEHICLES AND

01:07:32.381 --> 01:07:34.717
TRUCKS AS BEING A CONSTRAINT

01:07:34.784 --> 01:07:38.020
BECAUSE IT IS VERY EXPENSIVE TO.

01:07:38.087 --> 01:07:40.189
PULL THOSE VEHICLES OFF THE ROAD

01:07:40.256 --> 01:07:42.158
EARLY WHEN THEY'RE STILL BEING

01:07:42.224 --> 01:07:44.994
USED AND USEFUL THAT'S QUITE

01:07:45.060 --> 01:07:48.164
EXPENSIVE- BUT YOU KNOW THERE'S

01:07:48.230 --> 01:07:51.400
- AN- PIECE OF INFRASTRUCTURE

01:07:51.467 --> 01:07:55.171
BUILD REQUIRED TO ACHIEVE THE

01:07:55.237 --> 01:07:57.406
ZERO CARBON ELECTRICITY GOALS-

01:07:57.473 --> 01:07:59.442
THAT ALSO WE DON'T REQUIRES

01:07:59.508 --> 01:08:01.544
BUILDING NEW TRANSMISSION

01:08:01.610 --> 01:08:03.779
BUILDING ZERO CARBON RENEWABLE

01:08:03.846 --> 01:08:07.883
CAPACITY- SO. THERE THERE IS A

01:08:07.950 --> 01:08:10.152
IT WE CALL IT SOMETIMES

01:08:10.219 --> 01:08:12.087
INFRASTRUCTURE INERTIA. IT'S

01:08:12.154 --> 01:08:14.523
JUST THAT IT THE TIMING

01:08:14.590 --> 01:08:17.660
CHALLENGE IN HOW QUICKLY THIS

01:08:17.726 --> 01:08:19.795
INFRASTRUCTURE CAN BE BUILT- IN

01:08:19.862 --> 01:08:23.666
IN EACH SECTOR. THANKS IS A

01:08:23.732 --> 01:08:26.669
FINALLY AND SO. YOU'RE REMEMBER

01:08:26.735 --> 01:08:29.138
YOUR MOST AGGRESSIVE NERI THIS

01:08:29.205 --> 01:08:32.074
BOUT IS IT THIRTY THREE MILLION

01:08:32.141 --> 01:08:33.843
MEGATONS OF NEGATIVE EMISSIONS

01:08:33.909 --> 01:08:36.645
IS THAT THE THAT'S YEAH THAT WAS

01:08:36.712 --> 01:08:39.248
OUR- MOST AGGRESSIVE SCENARIO

01:08:39.315 --> 01:08:42.384
THAT ELIMINATED FOSSIL FUEL

01:08:42.451 --> 01:08:45.087
COMBUSTION BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE

01:08:45.154 --> 01:08:48.557
THE ZERO CARBON ENERGY SCENARIO

01:08:48.624 --> 01:08:50.159
- AND WHAT I'M FOR YOUR MIND

01:08:50.226 --> 01:08:51.760
WHAT ARE SOME EXAMPLES OF WHAT

01:08:51.827 --> 01:08:52.995
CAN COULD BE COUNTED AS NEGATIVE

01:08:53.062 --> 01:08:56.398
EMISSIONS. YEAH SO. THERE'S A

01:08:56.465 --> 01:08:58.667
RANGE OF CARBON DIOXIDE REMOVAL

01:08:58.734 --> 01:09:01.971
STRATEGIES- THE MOST WIDELY

01:09:02.037 --> 01:09:04.340
COMMERCIALIZED TODAY IS DIRECT

01:09:04.406 --> 01:09:06.942
AIR CAPTURE OF CO TWO FROM THE

01:09:07.009 --> 01:09:09.712
ATMOSPHERE. BUT THERE'S ALSO YOU

01:09:09.778 --> 01:09:11.514
KNOW LESS THAN ONE MILLION

01:09:11.580 --> 01:09:14.016
METRIC TON OF DIRECT AIR CAPTURE

01:09:14.083 --> 01:09:17.419
DEPLOYED GLOBALLY TODAY. SO

01:09:17.486 --> 01:09:19.188
RELYING ENTIRELY ON THAT

01:09:19.255 --> 01:09:22.124
STRATEGY SEEMS RISKY AND

01:09:22.191 --> 01:09:24.994
CHALLENGING. IT ALSO REQUIRES A

01:09:25.060 --> 01:09:27.429
SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF ENERGY TO

01:09:27.496 --> 01:09:30.499
POWER DIRECTOR CAPTURE SO IT'S

01:09:30.566 --> 01:09:32.701
NOT WITHOUT ITS OWN CHALLENGES.

01:09:32.768 --> 01:09:34.436
THERE ARE OTHER TYPES OF CARBON

01:09:34.503 --> 01:09:36.071
DIOXIDE REMOVAL STRATEGIES

01:09:36.138 --> 01:09:37.072
INCLUDING THE POTENTIAL TO

01:09:37.139 --> 01:09:38.874
SEQUESTER CARBON IN NATURAL AND

01:09:38.941 --> 01:09:41.644
WORKING LANDS BUT AS YOU KNOW

01:09:41.710 --> 01:09:43.979
CALIFORNIA'S AT STRUGGLING WITH

01:09:44.046 --> 01:09:46.482
WILDFIRES AND CLIMATE CHANGE AND

01:09:46.549 --> 01:09:48.817
SO. YOU KNOW USING OUR NATURAL

01:09:48.884 --> 01:09:50.286
AND WORKING LANDS IS A CARBON

01:09:50.352 --> 01:09:53.889
SINK AT IS IT A CHALLENGE ONTO

01:09:53.956 --> 01:09:57.259
ITSELF. THERE'S OTHER AND MORE

01:09:57.326 --> 01:09:59.295
SPECULATIVE FORMS OF CARBON

01:09:59.361 --> 01:10:01.363
DIOXIDE REMOVAL SUCH AS THINGS

01:10:01.430 --> 01:10:04.099
LIKE ENHANCED WEATHERIZATION-

01:10:04.166 --> 01:10:08.504
BUT SAID. I THINK AT SCALE

01:10:08.571 --> 01:10:11.540
DIRECT AIR CAPTURE IS THE MOST

01:10:11.607 --> 01:10:16.612
LIKELY SOLUTION IN THE NEAR TERM

01:10:16.679 --> 01:10:17.246
. OKAY GREAT THANK YOU SO MUCH

01:10:17.313 --> 01:10:20.015
AND JUST GIVE IT UP BECAUSE WE

01:10:20.082 --> 01:10:22.451
HAD PREVIOUSLY MET HOW CONFIDENT

01:10:22.518 --> 01:10:23.218
CAN WE BE THAT THESE NEGATIVE

01:10:23.285 --> 01:10:25.521
EMISSIONS. ARE BECOMING

01:10:25.588 --> 01:10:27.890
PERMANENT AN ADDITIONAL. BECAUSE

01:10:27.957 --> 01:10:29.024
WE THERE'S BEEN CONCERNS ABOUT

01:10:29.091 --> 01:10:31.026
OTHER OFFSETS THAT HAVE NOT.

01:10:31.093 --> 01:10:33.796
BEEN PERMITTED AN ADDITIONAL.

01:10:33.862 --> 01:10:35.764
YEAH I THINK THAT'S AN EXCELLENT

01:10:35.831 --> 01:10:38.067
CONCERN AND WHEN ONE THAT WILL

01:10:38.133 --> 01:10:40.102
NEED TO BE CAREFULLY MONITORED

01:10:40.169 --> 01:10:44.807
AND EVALUATED- THE BENEFIT OF

01:10:44.873 --> 01:10:46.609
DIRECT AIR CAPTURE IS THAT YOU

01:10:46.675 --> 01:10:48.377
CAN MEASURE THE CARBON DIOXIDE

01:10:48.444 --> 01:10:51.146
THAT IS BEING CAPTURED AND WHERE

01:10:51.213 --> 01:10:53.816
THAT CO TWO IS BEING SEQUESTERED

01:10:53.882 --> 01:10:57.019
. BUT IF IT'S IF THERE IS NO

01:10:57.086 --> 01:10:59.121
REGULATIONS AND COMPLIANCE

01:10:59.188 --> 01:11:01.123
MECHANISMS IN PLACE I WOULD ALSO

01:11:01.190 --> 01:11:03.192
BE CONCERNED ABOUT ABOUT THE

01:11:03.259 --> 01:11:05.728
ADDITIONALITY STYLE- I THINK

01:11:05.794 --> 01:11:09.064
THAT THE- THAT THE POLICIES NEED

01:11:09.131 --> 01:11:11.300
TO BE IN PLACE TO ENSURE THAT

01:11:11.367 --> 01:11:13.702
THOSE NEGATIVE EMISSIONS- ARE

01:11:13.769 --> 01:11:15.371
ARE PERMANENT AS PERMANENCE CAN

01:11:15.437 --> 01:11:23.145
BE. THANK YOU. I THE MINISTER

01:11:23.212 --> 01:11:24.813
GARCIA THANK IS CHAIR I'M

01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:26.982
INTERESTED IN- EXTENDING A BIT

01:11:27.049 --> 01:11:28.617
OF THE CONVERSATION THAT MY

01:11:28.684 --> 01:11:29.685
COLLEAGUE FROM CENTRAL VALLEY IS

01:11:29.752 --> 01:11:31.654
PUT FORWARD- SPECIFICALLY TO

01:11:31.720 --> 01:11:33.522
CARBON CAPTURE TECHNOLOGY YOU

01:11:33.589 --> 01:11:35.290
MENTIONED WHAT'S MISSING RIGHT

01:11:35.357 --> 01:11:38.227
IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO PROVE THE

01:11:38.293 --> 01:11:39.628
COMMERCIALIZATION OF THE

01:11:39.695 --> 01:11:41.830
TECHNOLOGY WE HERE. IN THE

01:11:41.897 --> 01:11:43.899
BUILDING QUITE OFTEN AND I REFER

01:11:43.966 --> 01:11:46.035
TO IT AS SOME KIND OF THE- THE

01:11:46.101 --> 01:11:48.003
FLAVOR OF THE DAY YOU KNOW AND

01:11:48.070 --> 01:11:49.371
RIGHT NOW AND THE TECHNOLOGY

01:11:49.438 --> 01:11:52.307
CONVERSATIONS AROUND RENEWABLE-

01:11:52.374 --> 01:11:53.375
TECHNOLOGIES IT'S THE CARBON

01:11:53.442 --> 01:11:55.310
CAPTURING TECHNOLOGIES AT WHAT

01:11:55.377 --> 01:11:57.579
IS THE FRAMEWORK- THE REGULATORY

01:11:57.646 --> 01:12:01.050
FRAMEWORK THAT YOU BELIEVE- IS

01:12:01.116 --> 01:12:04.186
STILL NOT- IN PLACE. TO BE ABLE

01:12:04.253 --> 01:12:07.056
TO THEN GET TO THE LEVEL OF-

01:12:07.122 --> 01:12:08.824
PROOF WHEN IT COMES TO.

01:12:08.891 --> 01:12:10.325
COMMERCIALIZATION BECAUSE WE'RE

01:12:10.392 --> 01:12:12.761
HEARING A LOT OF. A LOT OF

01:12:12.828 --> 01:12:14.530
PEOPLE. LEANING ON THIS

01:12:14.596 --> 01:12:17.833
TECHNOLOGY AND THE ABILITY TO

01:12:17.900 --> 01:12:19.802
HELP WITH THE JUST TRANSITION

01:12:19.868 --> 01:12:21.637
OF- MANY MANY JOBS THE EXISTING

01:12:21.704 --> 01:12:24.173
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT IS IN PLACE-

01:12:24.239 --> 01:12:26.008
TO BE ABLE TO ENSURE THAT- WE

01:12:26.075 --> 01:12:28.310
CAN. GET TO OUR OUR GOALS AND

01:12:28.377 --> 01:12:30.479
OBJECTIVES- MUCH QUICKER WITHOUT

01:12:30.546 --> 01:12:34.383
A- MAJOR DISPLACEMENT OF PEOPLE

01:12:34.450 --> 01:12:37.019
WORKING IN CURRENT. INDUSTRIES

01:12:37.086 --> 01:12:38.620
THAT WE'RE TRYING TO SLOWLY

01:12:38.687 --> 01:12:40.589
PHASE OUT SO MAYBE YOU CAN SHARE

01:12:40.656 --> 01:12:42.524
WITH US YOUR THOUGHTS ON. WHAT

01:12:42.591 --> 01:12:44.059
IS A REGULATORY FRAMEWORK LOOK

01:12:44.126 --> 01:12:46.061
LIKE THEY NEED TO BE IN PLACE IN

01:12:46.128 --> 01:12:46.995
ORDER TO DEMONSTRATE THE

01:12:47.062 --> 01:12:49.865
SCALABILITY OF THIS TECHNOLOGY.

01:12:49.932 --> 01:12:52.401
THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION- AND I

01:12:52.468 --> 01:12:54.203
WILL NOT PRETEND TO BE AN EXPERT

01:12:54.269 --> 01:12:56.338
ON REGULATION OF CARBON CAPTURE

01:12:56.405 --> 01:12:59.575
AND SEQUESTRATION- BUT I WOULD.

01:12:59.641 --> 01:13:02.611
SUGGEST THAT. THERE NEEDS TO BE

01:13:02.678 --> 01:13:06.582
A MEASUREMENT. MONITORING AND

01:13:06.648 --> 01:13:08.817
VERIFICATION PROTOCOL.

01:13:08.884 --> 01:13:11.019
ASSOCIATED WITH CARBON CAPTURE

01:13:11.086 --> 01:13:15.023
AND SEQUESTRATION- TO ENSURE

01:13:15.090 --> 01:13:17.292
THAT AS THE CARBON STAYS

01:13:17.359 --> 01:13:21.997
UNDERGROUND AND HI THIS IS-

01:13:22.064 --> 01:13:25.400
SAFELY UNDERGROUND. ARE THERE

01:13:25.467 --> 01:13:29.772
ANY- ASSESSMENTS OF WHAT- COULD

01:13:29.838 --> 01:13:32.474
BE THE EXTENT OF. THE STATE

01:13:32.541 --> 01:13:34.076
GOVERNMENT'S ROLE IN INVESTING

01:13:34.143 --> 01:13:37.980
IN THOSE EFFORTS- WHAT IS MAYBE

01:13:38.046 --> 01:13:40.682
TOO MUCH TO INVEST IN SOME NEW

01:13:40.749 --> 01:13:44.319
TECHNOLOGY LIKE THIS- YEAH THE

01:13:44.386 --> 01:13:46.355
TYPE OF INCENTIVES THAT- ARE

01:13:46.421 --> 01:13:48.490
ASKED TO FROM US TO BE PUT

01:13:48.557 --> 01:13:50.926
FORWARD WHEN IT COMES TO NEW

01:13:50.993 --> 01:13:52.094
TECHNOLOGIES LIKE. SOLAR AND

01:13:52.161 --> 01:13:54.396
WIND MANY YEARS AGO- TO BRING IT

01:13:54.463 --> 01:13:58.133
TO POINT WHERE IT'S NOW- TOUTED

01:13:58.200 --> 01:13:59.935
THAT IT IS AFFORDABLE TO DO I

01:14:00.002 --> 01:14:02.137
MEAN I'M WONDERING DO YOU HAVE

01:14:02.204 --> 01:14:04.006
ANY THOUGHTS ON ON THAT IN TERMS

01:14:04.072 --> 01:14:05.474
OF THE FISCAL- ELEMENTS ARE

01:14:05.541 --> 01:14:07.543
INVESTMENTS ON ON STATE

01:14:07.609 --> 01:14:08.544
GOVERNMENT SIDE. TO TECHNOLOGY

01:14:08.610 --> 01:14:12.214
LIKE THIS. WELL I DO KNOW THAT

01:14:12.281 --> 01:14:13.816
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THROUGH

01:14:13.882 --> 01:14:16.351
THE FORTY FIVE Q. TAX CREDITS IS

01:14:16.418 --> 01:14:18.854
ALREADY COMMITTED. A SIGNIFICANT

01:14:18.921 --> 01:14:21.456
INCENTIVE TOWARDS CARBON CAPTURE

01:14:21.523 --> 01:14:26.762
AND SEQUESTRATION. SO. IN TERMS

01:14:26.829 --> 01:14:30.399
OF ADDITIONAL STATE SUPPORT- I'M

01:14:30.465 --> 01:14:34.203
NOT SURE THAT. ADDITIONAL TAX

01:14:34.269 --> 01:14:36.505
CREDITS WOULD BE NEEDED FOR CCS

01:14:36.572 --> 01:14:42.444
SPECIFICALLY. MY PERSONAL VIEW

01:14:42.511 --> 01:14:46.215
MIGHT BE TO FOCUS THOSE DOLLARS

01:14:46.281 --> 01:14:49.451
ON- ON OTHER SECTORS GIVEN THAT

01:14:49.518 --> 01:14:53.021
THE FEDERAL TAX INCENTIVES ARE

01:14:53.088 --> 01:14:54.857
ALREADY IN PLACE FOR CCS. WE

01:14:54.923 --> 01:14:56.925
APPRECIATE BOTH OF YOUR PERSONAL

01:14:56.992 --> 01:14:59.494
VIEW GIVEN THAT YOU DO HAVE SOME

01:14:59.561 --> 01:15:00.896
EXPERTISE IN THE WORK THAT WE'RE

01:15:00.963 --> 01:15:02.564
TALKING ABOUT AND ALSO JUST TO

01:15:02.631 --> 01:15:04.733
THE OVERALL OF UNDERSTANDING OF

01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:06.335
WHAT'S HAPPENING AT THE FEDERAL

01:15:06.401 --> 01:15:07.236
GOVERNMENT ALSO THANK YOU FOR

01:15:07.302 --> 01:15:09.938
SHARING THAT- MIGHT MY NEXT SET

01:15:10.005 --> 01:15:11.206
OF QUESTIONS WILL BE AROUND THE

01:15:11.273 --> 01:15:12.975
IDEA THAT WE CONSTANTLY TALK

01:15:13.041 --> 01:15:15.110
ABOUT. WE NEED A MIXED BAG OF

01:15:15.177 --> 01:15:17.880
TOOLS- IN ORDER TO GET TO OUR

01:15:17.946 --> 01:15:19.648
OBJECTIVES RIGHT BUT WHEN IT

01:15:19.715 --> 01:15:21.617
COMES TO HAVING SOME OF THESE

01:15:21.683 --> 01:15:23.552
CONVERSATIONS WHERE B. LET'S

01:15:23.619 --> 01:15:25.053
TALK ABOUT HYDROGEN LET'S TALK

01:15:25.120 --> 01:15:26.889
ABOUT SOME FOLKS AND OF OUR

01:15:26.955 --> 01:15:28.724
COLLEAGUES ONE TALK ABOUT- AT

01:15:28.790 --> 01:15:30.125
RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS OTHER

01:15:30.192 --> 01:15:32.194
FOLKS WANT TO TALK ABOUT. OTHER

01:15:32.261 --> 01:15:34.963
TOOLS IN THE TOOLBOX- BUT THEN

01:15:35.030 --> 01:15:36.965
WE GET STUCK ON THE IDEA OF

01:15:37.032 --> 01:15:40.035
ELECTRIFICATION- WHICH I AM A

01:15:40.102 --> 01:15:43.205
100% IN FAVOR OF FOR A LOT OF

01:15:43.272 --> 01:15:44.306
REASONS INCLUDING THE-

01:15:44.373 --> 01:15:46.541
CIRCUMSTANCES THAT SURROUND THE

01:15:46.608 --> 01:15:48.310
REGION THAT I REPRESENT WITH

01:15:48.377 --> 01:15:51.079
LITHIUM I RECOVERY- BEING FRONT

01:15:51.146 --> 01:15:52.180
AND CENTER OF A LOT OF

01:15:52.247 --> 01:15:54.182
DISCUSSIONS NATIONALLY. AND HERE

01:15:54.249 --> 01:15:56.285
IN OUR STATE BUT I ALSO SEE AN

01:15:56.351 --> 01:16:00.155
OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY- HIT SOME

01:16:00.222 --> 01:16:03.425
LOW HANGING FRUIT- WHEN IT COMES

01:16:03.492 --> 01:16:04.693
TO IMPROVING AIR QUALITY IN

01:16:04.760 --> 01:16:06.495
EMISSION REDUCTIONS USING THE

01:16:06.561 --> 01:16:07.996
DIFFERENT TOOLS IN THE TOOLBOX

01:16:08.063 --> 01:16:10.065
BUT IT'S VERY DIFFICULT-

01:16:10.132 --> 01:16:11.366
OCCASIONALLY WHEN THESE

01:16:11.433 --> 01:16:13.035
CONVERSATIONS COME UP TO GET

01:16:13.101 --> 01:16:14.703
SOME OF OUR ENVIRONMENTAL.

01:16:14.770 --> 01:16:19.041
FRIENDS TO AGREE. THAT THAT WE

01:16:19.107 --> 01:16:21.043
COULD USE- HYDROGEN SOME CASES

01:16:21.109 --> 01:16:22.778
THAT IN SOME PLACES THAT MIGHT

01:16:22.844 --> 01:16:25.314
WORK- TO MOVE IN THE DIRECTION

01:16:25.380 --> 01:16:27.382
OF RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS AND

01:16:27.449 --> 01:16:28.350
I'M- SHARING WITH YOU

01:16:28.417 --> 01:16:30.052
PERSPECTIVES THAT ARE DIVERSE.

01:16:30.118 --> 01:16:32.921
IN THE ASSEMBLY CONVERSATIONS

01:16:32.988 --> 01:16:34.623
AND SO THAT'S REALLY NOT MY

01:16:34.690 --> 01:16:35.991
SPECIFIC VIEWS ITSELF BUT I'M

01:16:36.058 --> 01:16:37.592
TRYING TO REFLECT THE- A

01:16:37.659 --> 01:16:38.994
CONVERSATION THAT ARE HAPPY THAT

01:16:39.061 --> 01:16:41.496
THAT'S HAPPENING AMONGST OUR OUR

01:16:41.563 --> 01:16:43.398
COLLEAGUES. HOW DO WE SET. THE

01:16:43.465 --> 01:16:47.135
TONE. THAT WE HAVE TO. HAVE A

01:16:47.202 --> 01:16:48.637
DIVERSE PORTFOLIO IN ORDER TO

01:16:48.704 --> 01:16:51.173
ACHIEVE THESE GOALS AND NOT GET

01:16:51.239 --> 01:16:54.376
STUCK ON ONE PARTICULAR- LANE.

01:16:54.443 --> 01:16:55.978
AND PATHWAY BECAUSE I THINK THAT

01:16:56.044 --> 01:16:58.046
HAPPENS QUITE OFTEN- WITH US

01:16:58.113 --> 01:17:00.749
HERE IN- THE LEGISLATURE. I HAVE

01:17:00.816 --> 01:17:02.184
WHO WANT TO INVEST THE MONIES

01:17:02.250 --> 01:17:04.353
AND OTHER TECHNOLOGIES WE'RE

01:17:04.419 --> 01:17:06.521
BEING TOLD WERE TAKEN AWAY FROM.

01:17:06.588 --> 01:17:08.290
FROM ELECTRIFICATION GOALS AND

01:17:08.357 --> 01:17:10.993
OBJECTIVES AND SO YOUR THOUGHTS-

01:17:11.059 --> 01:17:13.462
YOUR POSITION ORGANIZATION

01:17:13.528 --> 01:17:14.963
ANALYSIS ON ANY OF THAT IS

01:17:15.030 --> 01:17:17.899
THERE. A ORDER OF HOW WE MIGHT

01:17:17.966 --> 01:17:19.601
BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE WITH THE

01:17:19.668 --> 01:17:24.039
VARIOUS. TOOLS IN THE TOOLBOX AS

01:17:24.106 --> 01:17:27.242
IT'S OFTEN SAID. I THINK IT'S A

01:17:27.309 --> 01:17:29.678
GREAT QUESTION. AND YOU KNOW

01:17:29.745 --> 01:17:32.781
HISTORICALLY I'VE BEEN A FAN OF

01:17:32.848 --> 01:17:34.649
TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL POLICY

01:17:34.716 --> 01:17:36.818
SOLUTIONS THAT LEAVE ROOM FOR

01:17:36.885 --> 01:17:38.787
THE FACT THAT THERE'S INNOVATION

01:17:38.854 --> 01:17:41.256
AND UNKNOWNS IN HOW TECHNOLOGY

01:17:41.323 --> 01:17:44.359
WILL DEVELOP. ON THAT SAID INNER

01:17:44.426 --> 01:17:46.728
ENERGY SYSTEMS MODELING WE TEND

01:17:46.795 --> 01:17:48.730
TO FIND SOME FAIRLY CONSISTENT

01:17:48.797 --> 01:17:51.800
THEMES WHEN LOOKING AT LEAST

01:17:51.867 --> 01:17:56.204
COST OR LOWER COST SOLUTIONS TO

01:17:56.271 --> 01:17:58.740
DECARBONIZE THE ECONOMY. AND AT

01:17:58.807 --> 01:18:01.143
THAT THAT TENDS TO BE DERIVED

01:18:01.209 --> 01:18:02.411
FROM SORT OF JUST THE

01:18:02.477 --> 01:18:07.916
FUNDAMENTAL- ENERGY REQUIREMENTS

01:18:07.983 --> 01:18:09.851
FOR DIFFERENT DECARBONISATION

01:18:09.918 --> 01:18:13.021
SOLUTIONS SO FOR EXAMPLE IN

01:18:13.088 --> 01:18:15.123
CALIFORNIA'S RELATIVELY MILD

01:18:15.190 --> 01:18:18.627
CLIMATE WE DO FIND THAT ELECTRIC

01:18:18.693 --> 01:18:20.629
AIR SOURCE HEAT PUMPS ARE VERY

01:18:20.695 --> 01:18:23.298
EFFICIENT. SOLUTION FOR

01:18:23.365 --> 01:18:26.368
DECARBONISING LOW TEMPERATURE

01:18:26.435 --> 01:18:28.170
HEAT NEEDS LIKE SPACE HEATING

01:18:28.236 --> 01:18:32.474
AND WATER HEATING- FOR THE-

01:18:32.541 --> 01:18:33.775
MAJORITY OF CUSTOMERS IN

01:18:33.842 --> 01:18:35.477
CALIFORNIA THAT WILL BE AN

01:18:35.544 --> 01:18:37.946
EFFECTIVE SOLUTION NO WE DON'T

01:18:38.013 --> 01:18:41.450
FIND THAT TO BE- AS CLEAR OF A

01:18:41.516 --> 01:18:44.719
SOLUTION IN COLDER CLIMATES- SO

01:18:44.786 --> 01:18:46.521
YOU KNOW. NORTHERN HIGHLAND

01:18:46.588 --> 01:18:48.290
ASIAN PARTS OF CALIFORNIA YOU

01:18:48.356 --> 01:18:49.925
MAY STILL NEED TO CARBONIZED

01:18:49.991 --> 01:18:52.894
FUELS AND OTHER PARTS OF THE

01:18:52.961 --> 01:18:54.496
COUNTRY THAT ARE COLDER WILL

01:18:54.563 --> 01:18:55.464
LIKELY STILL NEED DECARBONISE

01:18:55.530 --> 01:18:58.500
FEELS TO ME. WINTER PEAK HEATING

01:18:58.567 --> 01:19:02.938
NEEDS IN IN VERY COLD CLIMATES.

01:19:03.004 --> 01:19:04.806
SO YOU KNOW THAT'S THE SORT OF

01:19:04.873 --> 01:19:07.109
ONE EXAMPLE OF THE KIND OF MERIT

01:19:07.175 --> 01:19:09.511
ORDER OF DECARBONISATION

01:19:09.578 --> 01:19:11.413
SOLUTIONS THAT THEY DO VARY. BY

01:19:11.480 --> 01:19:15.884
SECTOR- BUT THESE ARE YOU KNOW

01:19:15.951 --> 01:19:18.653
THESE ARE. TRADEOFFS THAT

01:19:18.720 --> 01:19:21.156
INVOLVE- A RANGE OF

01:19:21.223 --> 01:19:23.191
CONSIDERATIONS NOT JUST ENERGY

01:19:23.258 --> 01:19:27.195
EFFICIENCY AND COST BUT ALSO. IN

01:19:27.262 --> 01:19:31.366
CUSTOMER CHOICES WHAT ARE YOU

01:19:31.433 --> 01:19:34.936
REALISTIC. RETROFIT SOLUTIONS

01:19:35.003 --> 01:19:36.371
FOR EXISTING BUILDINGS AND

01:19:36.438 --> 01:19:40.242
INDUSTRY- SO I THINK IT IS VERY

01:19:40.308 --> 01:19:43.945
HARD TO. CHOOSE A ONE SIZE FITS

01:19:44.012 --> 01:19:45.680
ALL SOLUTION FOR EVERY.

01:19:45.747 --> 01:19:48.283
APPLICATION AND THAT'S THAT'S

01:19:48.350 --> 01:19:50.519
WHERE I DO THINK THAT HAVING.

01:19:50.585 --> 01:19:54.189
CERTAIN THAT. TECHNOLOGY

01:19:54.256 --> 01:19:56.858
AGNOSTIC SOLUTIONS CAN BE

01:19:56.925 --> 01:19:59.461
BENEFICIAL THANK YOU FOR THAT

01:19:59.528 --> 01:20:02.197
ANSWER RIGHT I YEAH I AGREE- AND

01:20:02.264 --> 01:20:03.331
YOU KNOW THERE'S A FEW THINGS

01:20:03.398 --> 01:20:05.367
THAT WE TAKE AWAY FROM YOUR

01:20:05.433 --> 01:20:07.702
RESPONSE IN ONE OF A MIGHT I'M

01:20:07.769 --> 01:20:11.973
THINKING IS- D. REGION. RIGHT

01:20:12.040 --> 01:20:13.808
THAT KIND OF CAN ALSO DETERMINE

01:20:13.875 --> 01:20:16.611
THE TYPE OF TECHNOLOGIES- THAT-

01:20:16.678 --> 01:20:18.113
YOU INCORPORATE GIVEN THE

01:20:18.180 --> 01:20:21.149
CHANGES IN IN CLIMATE THAT WE'RE

01:20:21.216 --> 01:20:23.852
EXPERIENCING ARM. AND THE OTHER

01:20:23.919 --> 01:20:27.689
IS- I WANT TO JUST SAY THAT IT

01:20:27.756 --> 01:20:28.657
WITH THE BEST FIT LOW COST

01:20:28.723 --> 01:20:31.359
BENEFIT MODEL ARE THAT WE'VE

01:20:31.426 --> 01:20:33.795
UTILIZED OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS

01:20:33.862 --> 01:20:35.030
HAS REALLY PUT US IN A PLACE

01:20:35.096 --> 01:20:37.933
WHERE WE'RE STILL TALKING ABOUT-

01:20:37.999 --> 01:20:40.335
THE LACK OF ENERGY RELIABILITY.

01:20:40.402 --> 01:20:42.270
RIGHT THAT WE HAVE TOO MUCH OF

01:20:42.337 --> 01:20:45.407
ONE- THAT TECHNOLOGY IS NOT NOT

01:20:45.473 --> 01:20:48.443
THE OTHER AND ARE EXPERIENCING

01:20:48.510 --> 01:20:50.979
THE WHAT THE FAMOUS A LITTLE

01:20:51.046 --> 01:20:52.247
CURVE THAT WE SEE ON ON

01:20:52.314 --> 01:20:53.882
DOCUMENTS THAT WE TALK ABOUT AS

01:20:53.949 --> 01:20:56.218
THAT THE DOCTOR. AND NOT HAVING

01:20:56.284 --> 01:20:59.521
THE ENERGY RELIABILITY TO KEEP

01:20:59.588 --> 01:21:01.957
THE LIGHTS ON AND IN THAT THE

01:21:02.023 --> 01:21:03.391
APPROACH THERE HAS BEEN NO COST

01:21:03.458 --> 01:21:05.961
BEST FIT- AND SO I'M HOPEFUL

01:21:06.027 --> 01:21:08.163
THAT AS WE MOVE FORWARD WE TRULY

01:21:08.230 --> 01:21:09.898
TAKE A LOOK AT. THE LESSONS

01:21:09.965 --> 01:21:12.300
LEARNED THERE FOR PURPOSES OF

01:21:12.367 --> 01:21:16.104
GREATER. ENERGY RELIABILITY ALL

01:21:16.171 --> 01:21:17.272
I'M GONNA MAKE JUST ONE LAST.

01:21:17.339 --> 01:21:19.507
JOIN IN AND WANTED TO JUST

01:21:19.574 --> 01:21:20.342
PLANT. THE CONVERSATION HERE WE

01:21:20.408 --> 01:21:22.244
WE'RE PRIVILEGED ENOUGH TO CHAIR

01:21:22.310 --> 01:21:23.211
THE UTILITIES AND ENERGY

01:21:23.278 --> 01:21:24.946
COMMITTEE WHAT WE WANT TO SPEND

01:21:25.013 --> 01:21:27.449
QUITE A BIT OF TIME ON. THE

01:21:27.515 --> 01:21:29.384
CONVERSATION ABOUT TRANSMISSION

01:21:29.451 --> 01:21:31.820
. AND BECAUSE WITHOUT THE

01:21:31.886 --> 01:21:32.988
COMPONENT OF CONVENIENCE AND

01:21:33.054 --> 01:21:36.458
THEN TRANSITION- BUILD OUT- AND

01:21:36.524 --> 01:21:38.860
TODAY I BELIEVE. AND YOU MAY

01:21:38.927 --> 01:21:41.329
AGREE OR NOT BUT THAT- WE ARE

01:21:41.396 --> 01:21:42.831
NOT IN LINE TO MEET OUR

01:21:42.897 --> 01:21:44.399
RENEWABLE ENERGY GOALS. AND

01:21:44.466 --> 01:21:46.001
EMISSION REDUCTION GOALS FOR A

01:21:46.067 --> 01:21:48.603
LOT OF REASONS AND ONE OF THEM

01:21:48.670 --> 01:21:49.904
HAS TO DO WITH. HOW LONG IT

01:21:49.971 --> 01:21:51.840
TAKES TO SITE- PERMIT AND BUILD

01:21:51.906 --> 01:21:54.109
A TRANSMISSION AND AS WE TALK

01:21:54.175 --> 01:21:55.143
ABOUT ALL OF THESE TECHNOLOGIES

01:21:55.210 --> 01:21:56.745
INCLUDING CARBON. CAPTURE AND

01:21:56.811 --> 01:21:59.080
SEQUESTRATION- YOU KNOW THE LAST

01:21:59.147 --> 01:22:00.415
TRANSMISSION PROJECT IN

01:22:00.482 --> 01:22:01.983
CALIFORNIA IT'S MY UNDERSTAND

01:22:02.050 --> 01:22:02.884
TOOK NINE YEARS TO SITE AND

01:22:02.951 --> 01:22:05.754
PERMIT- WE'RE NOT GOING TO GET

01:22:05.820 --> 01:22:06.988
THERE RIGHT AND SO I'M HOPING

01:22:07.055 --> 01:22:08.390
THAT WE CAN. HAVE A

01:22:08.456 --> 01:22:10.225
CONVERSATION. WITH THIS

01:22:10.292 --> 01:22:12.160
COMMITTEE AND OTHER RELEVANT

01:22:12.227 --> 01:22:14.996
COMMITTEES AS IT RELATES TO WHAT

01:22:15.063 --> 01:22:17.932
WE CAN DO. BETTER WHEN IT COMES

01:22:17.999 --> 01:22:19.434
TO SITING AND PERMITTING

01:22:19.501 --> 01:22:21.836
TRANSMISSION FOR A MEETING OUR-

01:22:21.903 --> 01:22:23.238
CLIMATE AND RENEWABLE ENERGY

01:22:23.305 --> 01:22:24.839
OBJECTIVES AND- WONDER IF YOU

01:22:24.906 --> 01:22:26.675
HAVE ANY THOUGHTS ON THAT. AND

01:22:26.741 --> 01:22:28.743
THAT WOULD BE MY LAST QUESTION

01:22:28.810 --> 01:22:29.678
AND COMMENT THANK YOU MISTER

01:22:29.744 --> 01:22:32.847
CHAIR FOR MOMMY TO A CHIME IN IN

01:22:32.914 --> 01:22:35.150
THIS VERY IMPORTANT QUESTION.

01:22:35.216 --> 01:22:37.218
THANK YOU AND THEY DO HAVE A

01:22:37.285 --> 01:22:39.020
COMMENT THERE WHICH IS THAT. A

01:22:39.087 --> 01:22:42.324
LOT OF OUR WORK IT EATERY HAS.

01:22:42.390 --> 01:22:44.826
ILLUSTRATED THE VALUE OF A BROAD

01:22:44.893 --> 01:22:47.829
REGIONAL GRID IN ACHIEVING OUR

01:22:47.896 --> 01:22:50.231
DECARBONISATION GOALS RELIABLY

01:22:50.298 --> 01:22:52.167
AND COST EFFECTIVELY. AND

01:22:52.233 --> 01:22:54.436
BUILDING NEW TRANSMISSION. TO

01:22:54.502 --> 01:22:56.604
INTERCONNECT THOSE RENEWABLE

01:22:56.671 --> 01:23:00.308
RESOURCES INTO CALIFORNIA. IS

01:23:00.375 --> 01:23:02.877
ESSENTIAL AND IT IT DOES.

01:23:02.944 --> 01:23:05.080
CURRENTLY TAKE SOMETHING LIKE

01:23:05.146 --> 01:23:08.650
TEN YEARS DEPARTMENT A LARGE NEW

01:23:08.717 --> 01:23:10.352
TRANSMISSION LINE. WHICH IS

01:23:10.418 --> 01:23:12.520
PROBABLY SLOWER THAN WE WOULD

01:23:12.587 --> 01:23:14.756
LIKE IF WE WANT TO ACCELERATE

01:23:14.823 --> 01:23:21.596
OUR CLIMATE GOALS. THANK YOU

01:23:21.663 --> 01:23:23.064
WANT TO WELCOME THE ASSEMBLY

01:23:23.131 --> 01:23:25.567
MEMBER CLAUDIO OUR NEWEST MEMBER

01:23:25.633 --> 01:23:28.203
TO. OF THIS JOINT COMMITTEE-

01:23:28.269 --> 01:23:31.606
WELCOME ASSEMBLY MEMBER- DO YOU

01:23:31.673 --> 01:23:32.974
HAVE ANY QUESTIONS- AND AT THIS

01:23:33.041 --> 01:23:37.679
TIME. SENATE SKINNER HERE OKAY

01:23:37.746 --> 01:23:43.752
OKAY. ALL RIGHT I HAVE SOME.

01:23:43.818 --> 01:23:46.254
QUESTIONS I THANK YOU VERY MUCH

01:23:46.321 --> 01:23:50.892
MS MAHONEY- I'VE BEEN. FOCUSED

01:23:50.959 --> 01:23:54.362
ON YOUR STUDY- AT LEAST FOR THE

01:23:54.429 --> 01:23:57.665
LAST TWO YEARS AND- AND SO IT'S

01:23:57.732 --> 01:24:00.935
GREAT TO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO

01:24:01.002 --> 01:24:03.405
- I DO A DIVE MORE INTO YEAR

01:24:03.471 --> 01:24:05.540
TWENTY TWENTY REPORT- CHIEF IN

01:24:05.607 --> 01:24:06.074
CARBON NEUTRALITY IN IN

01:24:06.141 --> 01:24:09.778
CALIFORNIA FIRST OF ALL. MMHM

01:24:09.844 --> 01:24:11.546
BUT YOUR YOUR OCTOBER TWENTY

01:24:11.613 --> 01:24:14.883
TWENTY REPORT- TO. IT DID DO YOU

01:24:14.949 --> 01:24:16.751
STILL STAND BY THE REPORT I KNOW

01:24:16.818 --> 01:24:18.186
YOU CONTINUE TO BE WORKING WITH

01:24:18.253 --> 01:24:20.288
THE A. R. B. AS AS THEY ARE

01:24:20.355 --> 01:24:21.689
DEVELOPING THE SCOPING PLAN BUT-

01:24:21.756 --> 01:24:23.992
YOU KNOW BY AND LARGE THE THAT

01:24:24.058 --> 01:24:25.593
THE FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

01:24:25.660 --> 01:24:27.629
OF YOUR TWENTY TWENTY REPORT-

01:24:27.695 --> 01:24:30.098
YOU YOU STILL STAND BY THEM AS

01:24:30.165 --> 01:24:33.735
FAR AS YOUR WORK WITH A P.

01:24:33.802 --> 01:24:35.270
THAT'S RIGHT. YEP THERE WAS A-

01:24:35.336 --> 01:24:36.838
HIGHER LEVEL STUDY THAN WHAT

01:24:36.905 --> 01:24:38.306
WE'RE CURRENTLY UNDERTAKING SO I

01:24:38.373 --> 01:24:40.675
THINK WE'LL HAVE A LOT OF. NEW

01:24:40.742 --> 01:24:42.844
INSIGHTS- IT'S MORE DETAILED

01:24:42.911 --> 01:24:44.979
WORK. BUT THE HIGH LEVEL FINDING

01:24:45.046 --> 01:24:48.416
STILL STAND OKAY. SO I KNOW THAT

01:24:48.483 --> 01:24:51.119
IN YOUR REPORT. YOU FOCUS ON ON

01:24:51.186 --> 01:24:59.727
ON THREE. ACT WAYS- YEAR- HI.

01:24:59.794 --> 01:25:01.930
CARBON DIOXIDE REMOVAL SCENARIO

01:25:01.996 --> 01:25:04.966
YOUR ZERO CARBON ENERGY SCENARIO

01:25:05.033 --> 01:25:08.102
AND YOUR BALANCE SCENARIO WHERE-

01:25:08.169 --> 01:25:12.240
I BELIEVE. IT RANGES IN TERMS OF

01:25:12.307 --> 01:25:13.975
THE EMISSION REDUCTIONS AND

01:25:14.042 --> 01:25:15.777
GROWTH'S GREENHOUSE GAS

01:25:15.844 --> 01:25:21.349
EMISSIONS- FROM 92% REDUCTION.

01:25:21.416 --> 01:25:26.621
BY. 2045287% REDUCTION BEING THE

01:25:26.688 --> 01:25:31.159
BALLOT SCENARIO AND THE- AND THE

01:25:31.226 --> 01:25:33.394
THIRD SCENARIO THE PET THIRD

01:25:33.461 --> 01:25:35.897
PATHWAY BEING 80% REDUCTION IN

01:25:35.964 --> 01:25:41.236
GROSS GREAT GHG EMISSIONS. ARM

01:25:41.302 --> 01:25:43.037
FIRST OF A CLARIFICATION THE

01:25:43.104 --> 01:25:44.739
THESE ALL THREE OF THESE

01:25:44.806 --> 01:25:47.475
SCENARIOS- ARE TALKING ABOUT

01:25:47.542 --> 01:25:50.211
REDUCTIONS AND GROSS GHG

01:25:50.278 --> 01:25:54.716
EMISSIONS THAT DOES NOT INCLUDE-

01:25:54.782 --> 01:25:57.051
CARBON DIOXIDE REMOVAL AS PART

01:25:57.118 --> 01:25:59.220
OF THOSE PERCENTAGES IS DYING IS

01:25:59.287 --> 01:26:01.523
THAT CORRECT. THAT'S CORRECT

01:26:01.589 --> 01:26:05.827
OKAY SIR SO THE IDEA IS THAT THE

01:26:05.894 --> 01:26:07.996
CARBON DIOXIDE REMOVAL WOULD

01:26:08.062 --> 01:26:10.164
ADDRESS THE REMAINING PERCENTAGE

01:26:10.231 --> 01:26:11.332
IN ORDER TO GET TO THE HUNDRED

01:26:11.399 --> 01:26:14.302
PERCENT- CARBON NEUTRALITY BY

01:26:14.369 --> 01:26:17.105
BEFORE TWENTY FORTY FIVE.

01:26:17.171 --> 01:26:22.644
EXACTLY OKAY. SO- SO I A I GUESS

01:26:22.710 --> 01:26:24.412
. YOU KNOW THERE THERE WERE

01:26:24.479 --> 01:26:26.915
THERE WAS A BILL ON ON THE ON ON

01:26:26.981 --> 01:26:28.082
THIS LAST YEAR THAT THAT THAT

01:26:28.149 --> 01:26:33.588
STILL KICKING AROUND BUT- IT'S A

01:26:33.655 --> 01:26:35.356
- YOU KNOW THE QUESTION THAT WAS

01:26:35.423 --> 01:26:38.293
ON THE THAT I'VE HEARD OFTEN- IS

01:26:38.359 --> 01:26:40.261
HOW REALISTIC IS IT THAT WE CAN

01:26:40.328 --> 01:26:43.164
GET TO YOU KNOW 90% REDUCTION IN

01:26:43.231 --> 01:26:47.001
GROSS HG 87% 80% I MEAN. YOU

01:26:47.068 --> 01:26:49.037
KNOW WE N. N. N. ARE LINED LINE

01:26:49.103 --> 01:26:52.073
OF WORK IT'S OFTEN EASIER TO

01:26:52.140 --> 01:26:53.942
FIGURE OUT WHAT WE NEED TO DO

01:26:54.008 --> 01:26:55.977
IT'S HARD TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO

01:26:56.044 --> 01:26:58.646
GET THERE I WANT TO SEE IF YOU

01:26:58.713 --> 01:27:01.649
CAN OPINE ON HOW REALISTIC IT IS

01:27:01.716 --> 01:27:03.117
TO GET TO THESE- J. SHE

01:27:03.184 --> 01:27:07.355
REDUCTION GOALS. WELL IT'S

01:27:07.422 --> 01:27:13.294
REALISTIC FROM A TECHNOLOGY.

01:27:13.361 --> 01:27:14.796
FIVE AND ENERGY SYSTEMS

01:27:14.862 --> 01:27:18.066
PERSPECTIVE. BUT IT'S UNKNOWN

01:27:18.132 --> 01:27:20.735
HOW REALISTIC IT WOULD BE FROM

01:27:20.802 --> 01:27:23.571
AN ACTUAL IMPLEMENTATION

01:27:23.638 --> 01:27:27.108
CONSUMER ADOPTION- POINT OF VIEW

01:27:27.175 --> 01:27:30.178
BECAUSE WE DON'T YET HAVE THE

01:27:30.244 --> 01:27:31.946
POLICIES IN PLACE THAT WOULD

01:27:32.013 --> 01:27:34.782
ACCOMPLISH THAT GOAL. IF THAT

01:27:34.849 --> 01:27:36.451
ANSWERS YOUR QUESTION- IT

01:27:36.517 --> 01:27:39.387
BASICALLY WE KNOW THAT WE CAN DO

01:27:39.454 --> 01:27:41.656
IT IF WE CAN DEPLOY THE

01:27:41.723 --> 01:27:45.660
TECHNOLOGY. AT THE PACE THAT WE

01:27:45.727 --> 01:27:48.196
ASSUMED. IN THE MODEL BUT THE

01:27:48.262 --> 01:27:50.498
QUESTION IS HOW DO YOU GET THE

01:27:50.565 --> 01:27:53.835
DEPLOYMENT. HER AT THE PACE OF

01:27:53.901 --> 01:27:55.536
THE ASSUMED IN THE MODEL AND YOU

01:27:55.603 --> 01:27:57.772
KNOW THE MODEL CAN'T ANSWER THAT

01:27:57.839 --> 01:28:02.243
QUESTION. OKAY SO IT IS SO IN

01:28:02.310 --> 01:28:03.411
OTHER WORDS I'M DID THAT THREE

01:28:03.478 --> 01:28:05.980
PATHWAYS THE THREE SCENARIOS AT

01:28:06.047 --> 01:28:08.783
THE SET FORTH IN YOUR REPORT ME

01:28:08.850 --> 01:28:11.352
THAT DID THOSE ARE. THOSE ARE

01:28:11.419 --> 01:28:13.921
ROAD MAPS BUT BUT THEN IT'S- UP

01:28:13.988 --> 01:28:16.691
TO THE REST OF US TO FIGURE OUT.

01:28:16.758 --> 01:28:18.693
HOW TO MAKE IT WORK. YEAH THAT'S

01:28:18.760 --> 01:28:20.728
RIGHT I WOULD SAY WHAT WE'RE

01:28:20.795 --> 01:28:22.764
DOING I CALL IT A BACK THING

01:28:22.830 --> 01:28:25.233
EXERCISE SO WE'RE STARTING FROM

01:28:25.299 --> 01:28:27.001
THE END GOAL IN MIND WHICH IN

01:28:27.068 --> 01:28:29.237
THIS CASE IT WAS CARBON

01:28:29.303 --> 01:28:31.239
NEUTRALITY BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE.

01:28:31.305 --> 01:28:33.007
AND THEN ANSWERING THE QUESTION

01:28:33.074 --> 01:28:35.076
WHAT WOULD HAVE NEEDED TO HAPPEN

01:28:35.143 --> 01:28:37.311
BY WHEN IN ORDER TO GET US

01:28:37.378 --> 01:28:40.782
THERE. AND SO IT GIVES US SOME

01:28:40.848 --> 01:28:44.452
YOU KNOW ILLUSTRATIVE I BY POSTS

01:28:44.519 --> 01:28:46.220
FOR EACH SECTOR OF THE THINGS

01:28:46.287 --> 01:28:48.389
THAT NEED TO HAVE HAPPENED IN

01:28:48.456 --> 01:28:50.925
TERMS OF SALES OF ZERO EMISSION

01:28:50.992 --> 01:28:54.362
VEHICLES DEPLOYMENT OF.

01:28:54.429 --> 01:28:56.264
RENEWABLE ELECTRICITY IN TERMS

01:28:56.330 --> 01:28:59.333
OF TOTAL MEGAWATTS OF CAPACITY.

01:28:59.400 --> 01:29:00.668
YEAH I THINK THOSE ARE USEFUL

01:29:00.735 --> 01:29:03.771
DATA POINTS. BUT IT STILL

01:29:03.838 --> 01:29:04.706
DOESN'T ANSWER THE QUESTION OF

01:29:04.772 --> 01:29:06.441
YOU KNOW WHERE'S THE FUNDING

01:29:06.507 --> 01:29:09.210
COMING FROM- AND WHAT'S THE

01:29:09.277 --> 01:29:12.346
POLICY MECHANISM TO ENABLE AND-

01:29:12.413 --> 01:29:14.515
FOR REQUIRE THAT LEVEL OF

01:29:14.582 --> 01:29:17.485
TECHNOLOGY DEPLOYMENT. ALL RIGHT

01:29:17.552 --> 01:29:20.688
. SO I WAS ON A CONFERENCE

01:29:20.755 --> 01:29:23.658
RECENTLY AND- THERE WERE THERE

01:29:23.725 --> 01:29:26.728
WAS A PERSPECTIVE OFFERED THAT-

01:29:26.794 --> 01:29:29.263
THAT THE- YOU KNOW DID IT DID

01:29:29.330 --> 01:29:30.998
THE PROBLEM WITH CLIMATE CHANGE

01:29:31.065 --> 01:29:33.301
IS NOT WITH FOSSIL FUELS THE

01:29:33.367 --> 01:29:37.839
PROBLEM IS WITH THE CO TWO- YOU

01:29:37.905 --> 01:29:40.608
KNOW SUGGESTING THAT THAT- IN A

01:29:40.675 --> 01:29:43.511
WAY IF. YOU KNOW THIS WONDERFUL

01:29:43.578 --> 01:29:45.980
TECHNOLOGY OF CARBON CAPTURE AND

01:29:46.047 --> 01:29:47.982
STORAGE CARBON CAPTURE

01:29:48.049 --> 01:29:49.951
UTILIZATION AND STORAGE WAY

01:29:50.017 --> 01:29:53.121
WHATEVER YOU. CHOOSE TO. TO CALL

01:29:53.187 --> 01:29:57.425
IT- IF THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO-

01:29:57.492 --> 01:30:00.495
YOU KNOW RELY HEAVILY ON FOSSIL

01:30:00.561 --> 01:30:03.664
FUELS YOU KNOW. IF WE UTILIZE

01:30:03.731 --> 01:30:05.566
THESE THE WONDERFUL NEW

01:30:05.633 --> 01:30:07.368
INNOVATIONS IN THE AREA OF

01:30:07.435 --> 01:30:09.237
CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE WE

01:30:09.303 --> 01:30:11.339
WHAT WHAT IS YOUR OPINION ON ON

01:30:11.405 --> 01:30:15.877
THAT POSITION. THAT SOUNDS LIKE

01:30:15.943 --> 01:30:19.180
A GROSS OVERSIMPLIFICATION TO ME

01:30:19.247 --> 01:30:20.548
FIRST OF ALL WE KNOW THAT THE

01:30:20.615 --> 01:30:22.216
TRANSPORTATION SECTOR IS THE

01:30:22.283 --> 01:30:25.219
LARGEST SOURCE OF GREENHOUSE GAS

01:30:25.286 --> 01:30:28.523
EMISSIONS IN THE STATE AND

01:30:28.589 --> 01:30:30.324
THAT'S BECAUSE OF FOSSIL FUEL

01:30:30.391 --> 01:30:33.828
EMISSIONS AND WE- THAT.

01:30:33.895 --> 01:30:35.496
ELECTRIFICATION OF THE

01:30:35.563 --> 01:30:36.831
TRANSPORTATION SECTOR IS AN

01:30:36.898 --> 01:30:38.432
IMPORTANT STRATEGY TO REDUCE

01:30:38.499 --> 01:30:41.202
THOSE EMISSIONS. LIKE I SAID I

01:30:41.269 --> 01:30:42.436
DO SUPPORT CARBON CAPTURE AND

01:30:42.503 --> 01:30:44.305
SEQUESTRATION IS ONE OF THE

01:30:44.372 --> 01:30:46.507
TOOLS IN OUR TOOLBOX. BUT THAT

01:30:46.574 --> 01:30:48.643
DOESN'T MEAN THAT. WERE LEADING

01:30:48.709 --> 01:30:51.045
FOSSIL FUELS OFF THE HOOK

01:30:51.112 --> 01:30:54.215
ENTIRELY. IT IS THE CCS IS

01:30:54.282 --> 01:30:57.084
LIKELY TO PLAY. YOU KNOW A SMALL

01:30:57.151 --> 01:30:59.887
TARGETED STRATEGIC ROLE IN

01:30:59.954 --> 01:31:01.989
REDUCING EMISSIONS FROM

01:31:02.056 --> 01:31:05.560
OTHERWISE HARD TO ABATE SECTORS

01:31:05.626 --> 01:31:09.931
. BUT IT'S NOT A PANACEA. AND SO

01:31:09.997 --> 01:31:11.999
GOING BACK TO THE PERCENTAGES

01:31:12.066 --> 01:31:14.969
THAT WE STARTED TALKING ABOUT-

01:31:15.036 --> 01:31:17.605
IT'S COMPARED TO THE- THE THAT

01:31:17.672 --> 01:31:20.708
90% 92% REDUCTION IN IMPORT SAY

01:31:20.775 --> 01:31:23.778
90% IN- REDUCTION AND SHE SHE

01:31:23.845 --> 01:31:26.180
EMISSIONS OF NECESSARY. YOU'RE

01:31:26.247 --> 01:31:29.050
ENVISIONING YOU KNOW CARBON-

01:31:29.116 --> 01:31:33.721
DIOXIDE REMOVAL TECHNOLOGIES- AS

01:31:33.788 --> 01:31:35.456
WELL AS NATURAL WORKING LAND.

01:31:35.523 --> 01:31:38.626
THAT YOU KNOW APPROACH TO TAKE

01:31:38.693 --> 01:31:40.127
THA REMAINING PERCENTAGE

01:31:40.194 --> 01:31:46.467
BETWEEN 8% 220% OF THE NECESSARY

01:31:46.534 --> 01:31:47.468
REDUCTION TO REACH CARBON

01:31:47.535 --> 01:31:51.272
NEUTRALITY. WELL IT IT MAY WE

01:31:51.339 --> 01:31:53.541
MAY NOT EVEN NEED MORE CARBON

01:31:53.608 --> 01:31:55.443
DIOXIDE REMOVAL TECHNOLOGIES

01:31:55.509 --> 01:31:57.211
THAN THAT YOU KNOW I WOULD SAY

01:31:57.278 --> 01:31:58.813
THAT DEATH THREE SCENARIOS THAT

01:31:58.880 --> 01:32:00.815
WE EVALUATED IN THIS TWENTY

01:32:00.882 --> 01:32:03.684
TWENTY STUDY WERE VERY AMBITIOUS

01:32:03.751 --> 01:32:06.487
IN TERMS OF ASSUMING AS

01:32:06.554 --> 01:32:08.756
REDUCTIONS IN FOSSIL FUELS. THAT

01:32:08.823 --> 01:32:11.392
HAPPENED YOU KNOW MORE QUICKLY

01:32:11.459 --> 01:32:12.693
THAN WE'VE EVER SEEN

01:32:12.760 --> 01:32:17.164
HISTORICALLY- AND SO. EVEN YOU

01:32:17.231 --> 01:32:18.933
KNOW WHETHER WE CAN ACCOMPLISH

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:20.534
THAT IS I THINK STILL AN OPEN

01:32:20.601 --> 01:32:23.604
QUESTION AND WE MAY NEED EVEN

01:32:23.671 --> 01:32:25.373
MORE AT. CARBON DIOXIDE REMOVAL

01:32:25.439 --> 01:32:28.609
WE- IF WE CAN'T REDUCE OUR

01:32:28.676 --> 01:32:31.379
DIRECT GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS

01:32:31.445 --> 01:32:34.515
THAT AS QUICKLY AS WE WOULD LIKE

01:32:34.582 --> 01:32:37.285
. SO LOOKING TO BE A CARBON

01:32:37.351 --> 01:32:40.321
DIOXIDE REMOVAL STRATEGIES AND

01:32:40.388 --> 01:32:41.522
YOU YOU TALK IN YOUR REPORT

01:32:41.589 --> 01:32:44.492
ABOUT. AW YOU KNOW RELIANCE ON

01:32:44.558 --> 01:32:47.328
QUOTE RELATIVELY UNTESTED CARBON

01:32:47.395 --> 01:32:49.030
DIOXIDE REMOVAL STRATEGIES AND

01:32:49.096 --> 01:32:50.765
STRATEGIES WHICH ARE NOT A WIDE

01:32:50.831 --> 01:32:54.135
WIDELY COMMERCIALIZED I MEAN.

01:32:54.201 --> 01:32:57.004
THE IT IS IT IS IT FAIR TO SAY

01:32:57.071 --> 01:32:58.739
WHAT WHAT YOU TALKED ABOUT HOW

01:32:58.806 --> 01:33:01.342
THE MOST COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE

01:33:01.409 --> 01:33:04.745
AND SCALABLE- CARBON DIOXIDE-

01:33:04.812 --> 01:33:06.814
REMOVALS- OPTION THAT WE HAVE

01:33:06.881 --> 01:33:09.150
NOW IS DIRECT AIR CAPTURE THAT

01:33:09.216 --> 01:33:13.120
IT'S STILL. IS IN ITS INFANCY

01:33:13.187 --> 01:33:15.489
HIS IT IS AT A- IS THAT YOUR

01:33:15.556 --> 01:33:20.261
POSITION. THIRD STRAIGHT CARBON

01:33:20.328 --> 01:33:23.030
DIOXIDE REMOVAL- AND DIRECT AIR

01:33:23.097 --> 01:33:26.033
CAPTURE HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED

01:33:26.100 --> 01:33:27.568
THERE'S A FEW OPERATIONAL

01:33:27.635 --> 01:33:30.071
FACILITIES GLOBALLY SO I DO

01:33:30.137 --> 01:33:32.773
BELIEVE THAT IT IT CAN BE SCALED

01:33:32.840 --> 01:33:35.910
UP BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW QUICKLY

01:33:35.977 --> 01:33:37.712
AND IT IS STILL AS I MENTIONED

01:33:37.778 --> 01:33:39.814
AN EXPENSIVE AND ENERGY

01:33:39.880 --> 01:33:42.917
INTENSIVE PROCESS. SO THE GOAL

01:33:42.984 --> 01:33:45.653
IN THE SCENARIOS THAT WE MODELED

01:33:45.720 --> 01:33:47.088
IN TWENTY TWENTY WAS TO REDUCE

01:33:47.154 --> 01:33:49.790
THE RELIANCE ON DIRECT AIR

01:33:49.857 --> 01:33:52.893
CAPTURE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. BUT

01:33:52.960 --> 01:33:54.996
EVEN WITH THOSE VERY AMBITIOUS

01:33:55.062 --> 01:33:57.431
ASSUMPTIONS WE WERE NOT ABLE TO

01:33:57.498 --> 01:34:00.401
FIND A FEASIBLE WAY TO ELIMINATE

01:34:00.468 --> 01:34:02.470
ALL DIRECT EMISSIONS FROM THE

01:34:02.536 --> 01:34:06.741
STATE BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE. AND

01:34:06.807 --> 01:34:09.276
SO THAT NECESSITATES SOME OTHER

01:34:09.343 --> 01:34:12.446
SOLUTION AND WE WOULDWE WOULD

01:34:12.513 --> 01:34:13.948
LIKE TO HAVE A BETTER SOLUTION

01:34:14.015 --> 01:34:16.450
THAN THAN RELYING ON ONE IT IS

01:34:16.517 --> 01:34:18.119
NOT SO FULLY COMMERCIALIZED BUT-

01:34:18.185 --> 01:34:20.421
THE REALITY IS THAT THERE THERE

01:34:20.488 --> 01:34:23.224
IS NOT TODAY. AND I THINK THAT-

01:34:23.290 --> 01:34:25.292
CONSIDERATION SHOULD FACTOR INTO

01:34:25.359 --> 01:34:26.861
OUR DECISIONS ABOUT YOU KNOW

01:34:26.927 --> 01:34:28.429
TIMING AS WELL BECAUSE IT WILL

01:34:28.496 --> 01:34:32.833
TAKE TIME. TO COMMERCIALISE AND

01:34:32.900 --> 01:34:35.069
SCALE THESE NEW TECHNOLOGIES.

01:34:35.136 --> 01:34:40.207
ARM. THE POINT IS ALWAYS A IT

01:34:40.274 --> 01:34:42.276
HAS AS OFTEN ALSO OFTEN BEEN

01:34:42.343 --> 01:34:46.614
MADE THAT- THAT CALIFORNIA IS-

01:34:46.680 --> 01:34:50.518
IS- YOU KNOW- ESTIMATED TO

01:34:50.584 --> 01:34:54.288
CONTRIBUTE ABOUT 1% OF THE

01:34:54.355 --> 01:34:57.458
WORLD'S- GREENHOUSE GAS

01:34:57.525 --> 01:35:02.663
EMISSIONS- WHAT IS THE BIGGEST

01:35:02.730 --> 01:35:03.964
DIFFERENCE THAT CALIFORNIA CAN

01:35:04.031 --> 01:35:06.700
MAKE- YOU KNOW GLOBALLY GIVEN

01:35:06.767 --> 01:35:09.070
THAT WERE ONLY 1% OF OUR SHARE

01:35:09.136 --> 01:35:14.075
OF THE GLOBAL GHG. EMISSION IT'S

01:35:14.141 --> 01:35:16.777
A GREAT QUESTION. WELL I DO

01:35:16.844 --> 01:35:17.945
BELIEVE CALIFORNIA SOMETHING

01:35:18.012 --> 01:35:20.114
LIKE BETWEEN THE FIFTH AND THE

01:35:20.181 --> 01:35:23.017
SEVENTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE

01:35:23.084 --> 01:35:26.954
WORLD AND SO WHAT WE DO TO

01:35:27.021 --> 01:35:28.823
COMMERCIALIZE AND BRING DOWN THE

01:35:28.889 --> 01:35:30.791
COST OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES. AND TO

01:35:30.858 --> 01:35:33.160
DEMONSTRATE THE SCALABILITY OF

01:35:33.227 --> 01:35:36.197
TECHNOLOGIES. IS INCREDIBLY

01:35:36.263 --> 01:35:39.133
IMPORTANT BECAUSE OF THIS YOU

01:35:39.200 --> 01:35:42.970
LEADING. ROLE THAT WE PLAY IN

01:35:43.037 --> 01:35:45.873
THE GLOBAL ECONOMY. ALL RIGHT I

01:35:45.940 --> 01:35:47.675
THINK IT'S IN THAT LEADERSHIP

01:35:47.741 --> 01:35:49.710
POSITION THAT CALIFORNIA HAS A

01:35:49.777 --> 01:35:52.713
VERY IMPORTANT ROLE TO PLAY AND

01:35:52.780 --> 01:35:56.717
SO THAT WOULD INCLUDE. YOU ARE-

01:35:56.784 --> 01:35:58.853
IDENTIFYING CARBON CAPTURE

01:35:58.919 --> 01:36:01.088
CARBON DIOXIDE REMOVAL

01:36:01.155 --> 01:36:03.724
TECHNOLOGY- AS PART OF THAT

01:36:03.791 --> 01:36:05.759
INNOVATION THAT CALIFORNIA CAN

01:36:05.826 --> 01:36:09.130
CAN LEAD IN. YEAH I THINK SO

01:36:09.196 --> 01:36:13.501
OKAY. LAST TO COME IN BEFORE I

01:36:13.567 --> 01:36:15.703
TURN OVER TO THE CENTER SKINNER

01:36:15.769 --> 01:36:17.805
AYE I KNOW THAT TO. ONE OF THE

01:36:17.872 --> 01:36:21.742
MAIN. OBJECTIONS THAT WE GET TO-

01:36:21.809 --> 01:36:23.544
ANY KIND OF CARBON CAPTURE AND

01:36:23.611 --> 01:36:30.017
STORAGE- DISCUSSION IS THE

01:36:30.084 --> 01:36:32.286
CONCERN ESPECIALLY AND- LOW

01:36:32.353 --> 01:36:33.921
INCOME AND DISADVANTAGED

01:36:33.988 --> 01:36:40.861
COMMUNITIES OF- THE- FEAR THAT

01:36:40.928 --> 01:36:43.664
CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE WILL-

01:36:43.731 --> 01:36:47.501
YOU KNOW. ENABLE THE COULD THEY

01:36:47.568 --> 01:36:50.738
ARE OUR CONTINUED RELIANCE ON ON

01:36:50.804 --> 01:36:53.574
FOSSIL FUELS TO THE DETRIMENT OF

01:36:53.641 --> 01:36:56.043
THESE- ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE

01:36:56.110 --> 01:36:58.612
COMMUNITIES WHO HAVE SUFFERED A

01:36:58.679 --> 01:37:01.382
DISPROPORTIONATE AMOUNT OF TOXIC

01:37:01.448 --> 01:37:03.450
EMISSIONS AND CRITERIA

01:37:03.517 --> 01:37:06.687
POLLUTANTS. OUR OUR OUR OUR

01:37:06.754 --> 01:37:09.690
THEIR SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES- UP

01:37:09.757 --> 01:37:11.825
TO CARBON DIOXIDE REMOVAL IN

01:37:11.892 --> 01:37:15.262
TERMS OF THE CAPTURE AND REMOVAL

01:37:15.329 --> 01:37:17.398
OF TOXIC EMISSIONS AND CRITERIA

01:37:17.464 --> 01:37:22.570
POLLUTANTS. THAT'S A GOOD

01:37:22.636 --> 01:37:28.409
QUESTION- THERE'S CERTAINLY AT

01:37:28.475 --> 01:37:31.445
KNOX CONTROL TECHNOLOGIES AND

01:37:31.512 --> 01:37:34.782
OTHER WAYS TO REDUCE POLLUTION-

01:37:34.848 --> 01:37:36.483
WE'VE SEEN YOU KNOW ABATEMENT

01:37:36.550 --> 01:37:40.020
FROM MERCURY FROM COAL PLANTS

01:37:40.087 --> 01:37:42.556
FOR EXAMPLE SO. I WOULDN'T SAY

01:37:42.623 --> 01:37:44.692
THAT IT'S THE SAME TECHNOLOGY AS

01:37:44.758 --> 01:37:46.260
DIRECTOR CAPTURE BUT THERE ARE.

01:37:46.327 --> 01:37:52.199
OPTIONS THERE. THEY DO. CAN CURB

01:37:52.266 --> 01:37:54.602
THAT I COMMUNITIES SHOULD HAVE A

01:37:54.668 --> 01:37:57.938
VOICE IN THAT TYPES OF

01:37:58.005 --> 01:38:00.207
FACILITIES THAT ARE OPERATING IN

01:38:00.274 --> 01:38:03.444
THEIR NEIGHBORHOODS. SO I THINK

01:38:03.510 --> 01:38:06.513
THAT'S A FAIR CRITIQUE I ALSO

01:38:06.580 --> 01:38:08.415
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE

01:38:08.482 --> 01:38:10.618
DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN. DIRECT

01:38:10.684 --> 01:38:13.621
AIR CAPTURE WHICH IS A NEGATIVE

01:38:13.687 --> 01:38:14.488
EMISSIONS TECHNOLOGY AND CARBON

01:38:14.555 --> 01:38:16.590
CAPTURE AND SEQUESTRATION WHICH

01:38:16.657 --> 01:38:20.094
IS A WAY TO. ABATE POLLUTION

01:38:20.160 --> 01:38:21.462
THAT WOULD OTHERWISE GO INTO THE

01:38:21.528 --> 01:38:23.731
ATMOSPHERE SO THEY HAVE YOU KNOW

01:38:23.797 --> 01:38:25.466
VERY DIFFERENT APPLICATIONS

01:38:25.532 --> 01:38:26.834
COULD BE LOCATED IN VERY

01:38:26.900 --> 01:38:30.237
DIFFERENT. PARTS OF THE OF THE

01:38:30.304 --> 01:38:34.208
STATE. THERE'S ALSO. NO REASON

01:38:34.275 --> 01:38:35.809
THAT DIRECT AIR CAPTURE ACTUALLY

01:38:35.876 --> 01:38:37.945
NEEDS TO BE PHYSICALLY LOCATED

01:38:38.012 --> 01:38:42.783
IN CALIFORNIA. I BECAUSE IT'S-

01:38:42.850 --> 01:38:43.884
PULLING CARBON DIOXIDE OUT OF

01:38:43.951 --> 01:38:46.320
THE ATMOSPHERE WHICH IS A GLOBAL

01:38:46.387 --> 01:38:49.290
ABSOLUTE AND SO I THINK THAT'S

01:38:49.356 --> 01:38:50.491
ANOTHER IMPORTANT THING TO KEEP

01:38:50.557 --> 01:38:53.294
IN MIND. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU

01:38:53.360 --> 01:38:55.796
VERY MUCH SEVERAL SKINNER- THANK

01:38:55.863 --> 01:39:02.536
YOU FIVE. SERVER SIXTEEN. I'M

01:39:02.603 --> 01:39:07.941
YEAH I APPRECIATE THE- THE-

01:39:08.008 --> 01:39:09.176
TERRACE CONNECTING INTERNET

01:39:09.243 --> 01:39:12.746
MICHAEL THANK I HAD I HAD TURNED

01:39:12.813 --> 01:39:14.415
IT ON IS IT NOT THE WAY I

01:39:14.481 --> 01:39:17.184
APPRECIATE THAT YOU- INCLUDED IN

01:39:17.251 --> 01:39:22.589
THE REPORT THE- SOME OPTIONS-

01:39:22.656 --> 01:39:30.164
THE- THE NEED OR- POSSIBILITIES

01:39:30.230 --> 01:39:32.366
FOR CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE

01:39:32.433 --> 01:39:34.468
AND ARE BOTH I THINK YOU'RE BOTH

01:39:34.535 --> 01:39:35.903
TECHNOLOGIES AS FAR AS I CAN

01:39:35.969 --> 01:39:38.706
READ I READ THE REPORT. AND YET

01:39:38.772 --> 01:39:42.042
YOU ALSO YOUR- CAUTIONARY ABOUT

01:39:42.109 --> 01:39:45.446
THAT A MOMENT IT'S NOT WE DON'T

01:39:45.512 --> 01:39:47.681
HAVE THE COMMERCIALIZATION THAT

01:39:47.748 --> 01:39:52.920
WOULD PUT IT INTO A- A DOMINANT

01:39:52.986 --> 01:39:55.689
STRATEGY THAT WE WOULD RELY ON

01:39:55.756 --> 01:39:58.759
AND I THINK THE OTHER REASON

01:39:58.826 --> 01:40:00.594
AND- ASSEMBLY MEMBER SAID SHE

01:40:00.661 --> 01:40:02.162
KIND OF POINTED OUT THAT THE

01:40:02.229 --> 01:40:04.298
OTHER REASON IT WOULD I THINK

01:40:04.365 --> 01:40:08.402
BE- NOT WISE TO HAVE IT THE

01:40:08.469 --> 01:40:10.437
DOMINANT IS BECAUSE- WE DO NOT

01:40:10.504 --> 01:40:12.573
WANT TO USE. ANY OF THE

01:40:12.639 --> 01:40:13.774
TECHNOLOGIES WHETHER FOR

01:40:13.841 --> 01:40:16.610
DIRECTOR CAPTURE OR FOR THE

01:40:16.677 --> 01:40:19.847
CAPTURE AND SEQUESTRATION. TO

01:40:19.913 --> 01:40:22.182
SUBSTITUTE FOR EMISSIONS

01:40:22.249 --> 01:40:25.986
REDUCTIONS BUT RATHER- BECAUSE

01:40:26.053 --> 01:40:27.287
OF THE RIVER IT EMISSIONS

01:40:27.354 --> 01:40:29.356
REDUCTIONS IN THE MOVING OFF OF

01:40:29.423 --> 01:40:30.724
THE SOURCES THAT ARE CAUSING

01:40:30.791 --> 01:40:32.826
EMISSIONS IS SO ESSENTIAL BUT

01:40:32.893 --> 01:40:34.361
IT'S MORE RECOGNITION OF THAT

01:40:34.428 --> 01:40:38.232
THE CRISIS IS SO REAL RIGHT NOW.

01:40:38.298 --> 01:40:41.735
AND THE ACTIONS URGENT. AND

01:40:41.802 --> 01:40:44.004
QUICKLY NEEDED TO ABATE THE

01:40:44.071 --> 01:40:46.673
WORST DESTRUCTION THERE WE HAVE

01:40:46.740 --> 01:40:48.275
TO HAVE ALL THE TOOLS IN THE ON

01:40:48.342 --> 01:40:50.644
THE TABLE AND CLEARLY THE I. P.

01:40:50.711 --> 01:40:53.414
C. REPORT. SEVEN STREETS THAT

01:40:53.480 --> 01:40:55.549
LBNL DUE TO RECENT REPORT THAT

01:40:55.616 --> 01:40:57.151
DEMONSTRATES THAT IT ALL

01:40:57.217 --> 01:40:59.620
DEMONSTRATES THAT NOW. ON THE

01:40:59.686 --> 01:41:01.889
QUESTION OF. THE I THE

01:41:01.955 --> 01:41:04.458
COMMERCIALIZATION. IF WE TAKE

01:41:04.525 --> 01:41:06.093
FOR EXAMPLE UTILITY GRADE

01:41:06.160 --> 01:41:08.729
BATTERY STORAGE. AS FAR AS I

01:41:08.796 --> 01:41:11.698
KNOW THERE WA NO UTILITY GRADE

01:41:11.765 --> 01:41:14.334
BATTERY STORAGE. ONLINE IN

01:41:14.401 --> 01:41:17.404
CALIFORNIA. WHEN I PASSED WHEN I

01:41:17.471 --> 01:41:21.308
AUTHORED THE BILL. THAT I HAD

01:41:21.375 --> 01:41:25.712
THE UC START THE- PROCEEDINGS TO

01:41:25.779 --> 01:41:29.216
HAVE OUR UTILITIES PURCHASE I

01:41:29.283 --> 01:41:31.685
REGRADED IN ENERGY STORAGE AND

01:41:31.752 --> 01:41:34.254
NOT A MIND ACTUALLY I WANT TO

01:41:34.321 --> 01:41:35.255
CORRECT THAT IT WAS TECHNOLOGY

01:41:35.322 --> 01:41:37.891
NEUTRAL IN THE PURPOSE OF IT WAS

01:41:37.958 --> 01:41:40.060
TO JUST RECOGNIZE THAT AS WE

01:41:40.127 --> 01:41:44.097
MOVE TO- DECARBONIZE OUR

01:41:44.164 --> 01:41:45.899
ELECTRICITY GO TO RENEWABLES WE

01:41:45.966 --> 01:41:48.035
HAD TO HAVE SOME STORAGE WE HAVE

01:41:48.101 --> 01:41:51.071
TO DO. SO AND WE WANTED TO LOOK

01:41:51.138 --> 01:41:52.573
WHY SHOULD WE ALREADY PREDICT IN

01:41:52.639 --> 01:41:54.475
ADVANCE WHAT TECHNOLOGY IS GOING

01:41:54.541 --> 01:41:56.376
TO EMERGE LET'S JUST MAKE SURE

01:41:56.443 --> 01:41:58.145
WE SEND MARKET SIGNALS TO HELP

01:41:58.212 --> 01:41:59.713
INSURE THAT TECHNOLOGIES DO

01:41:59.780 --> 01:42:02.249
EMERGE. CIRCUIT SENDS SIGNALS TO

01:42:02.316 --> 01:42:03.484
GET THE ALREADY AND THE

01:42:03.550 --> 01:42:04.751
COMMERCIALIZATION THAT'S

01:42:04.818 --> 01:42:08.188
NECESSARY WE HAVE. PHENOMENALLY

01:42:08.255 --> 01:42:11.859
ACHIEVE THAT PHENOMENALLY SO IT

01:42:11.925 --> 01:42:14.228
IS SIMILAR. IN THAT WELL I CAN'T

01:42:14.294 --> 01:42:16.630
GUARANTEE THAT WE CAN ACHIEVE IT

01:42:16.697 --> 01:42:18.632
IN THIS OTHER AREA IT'S VERY

01:42:18.699 --> 01:42:20.033
IMPORTANT FOR US TO SEND THOSE

01:42:20.100 --> 01:42:23.437
SIGNALS AT THE SAME TIME. THAT

01:42:23.504 --> 01:42:25.572
WE DON'T RENEGE ON OUR GOALS OF

01:42:25.639 --> 01:42:28.575
THE OF MOVING OFF OF. THE

01:42:28.642 --> 01:42:30.844
SOURCES SO WHEN I LOOK AT

01:42:30.911 --> 01:42:32.079
CALIFORNIA'S POLICIES AND YOU

01:42:32.145 --> 01:42:34.047
KNOW THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE

01:42:34.114 --> 01:42:36.149
ORDER FOR EXAMPLE OF. STOPPING

01:42:36.216 --> 01:42:38.986
THE SALE OF COMBUSTION- VEHICLES

01:42:39.052 --> 01:42:41.255
SPICER NEAR AND SUCH. THAT IS

01:42:41.321 --> 01:42:45.058
CLEARLY INFORMING PEOPLE THAT WE

01:42:45.125 --> 01:42:46.193
- IN OTHER WORDS THOSE KIND OF

01:42:46.260 --> 01:42:49.129
POLICIES ALONG WITH SOME

01:42:49.196 --> 01:42:52.099
POLICIES AROUND DIRECTOR CAPTURE

01:42:52.165 --> 01:42:54.568
IN CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE. I

01:42:54.635 --> 01:42:57.771
WOULD HOPE WOULD. HELP TO

01:42:57.838 --> 01:42:59.406
AMELIORATE THESE CONCERNS THAT

01:42:59.473 --> 01:43:02.543
WE WOULD BE DOING SO JUST TO GET

01:43:02.609 --> 01:43:04.177
US TO RELY ON THOSE TECHNOLOGIES

01:43:04.244 --> 01:43:07.915
NOW. MY QUESTION TO YOU IS WELL

01:43:07.981 --> 01:43:11.451
YOU CAN'T. YOU INDICATED

01:43:11.518 --> 01:43:15.622
YOURSELF YOU DON'T KNOW. I I'M

01:43:15.689 --> 01:43:17.658
JUST MAYBE IT'S NOT APPROPRIATE

01:43:17.724 --> 01:43:20.427
SPECULATION BUT- DO YOU FEEL

01:43:20.494 --> 01:43:22.529
THAT A STATE LIKE CALIFORNIA

01:43:22.596 --> 01:43:24.865
GIVEN OUR LEADERSHIP ROLE THAT

01:43:24.932 --> 01:43:27.167
WERE THAT POLICIES IN THIS AREA

01:43:27.234 --> 01:43:31.038
MIGHT. WHAT'S YOUR SENSE OF HOW

01:43:31.104 --> 01:43:32.573
MUCH INFLUENCE YOU COULD HAVE ON

01:43:32.639 --> 01:43:34.074
HELPING TO GET THOSE

01:43:34.141 --> 01:43:36.510
TECHNOLOGIES BROUGHT. DEVELOPED

01:43:36.577 --> 01:43:40.781
AND BROUGHT TO MARKET. WELL YEAH

01:43:40.847 --> 01:43:43.750
AS I SAID CALIFORNIA IS A HUGE

01:43:43.817 --> 01:43:46.219
PLAYER IN THE GLOBAL ENERGY

01:43:46.286 --> 01:43:49.323
ECONOMY AND I DO THINK THAT- WE

01:43:49.389 --> 01:43:52.259
CAN HELP TO COMMERCIALIZE AND

01:43:52.326 --> 01:43:54.227
BRING DOWN THE COST OF REVENUE

01:43:54.294 --> 01:43:56.029
AND EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES

01:43:56.096 --> 01:43:59.433
ABSOLUTELY- AND YOU'RE YOU'RE

01:43:59.499 --> 01:44:02.202
CORRECT SENATOR SKINNER AND THAT

01:44:02.269 --> 01:44:03.770
I IT NONE OF OUR-

01:44:03.837 --> 01:44:07.307
DECARBONISATION SCENARIOS. RELY

01:44:07.374 --> 01:44:13.413
ON. A SINGLE STRATEGY- AND

01:44:13.480 --> 01:44:14.481
CARBON CAPTURE AND SEQUESTRATION

01:44:14.548 --> 01:44:19.720
IS OF RELATIVELY SMALL STRATEGY

01:44:19.786 --> 01:44:21.221
COMPARED TO THE OTHER

01:44:21.288 --> 01:44:22.823
DECARBONISATION SOLUTIONS THAT

01:44:22.889 --> 01:44:24.858
ARE BEING DEPLOYED. BUT IT IS

01:44:24.925 --> 01:44:27.961
STILL A CRITICAL STRATEGY TO

01:44:28.028 --> 01:44:29.496
GETTING TO NET ZERO OR CARBON

01:44:29.563 --> 01:44:33.266
NEUTRALITY. BECAUSE IT IS SUCH A

01:44:33.333 --> 01:44:37.270
DAUNTING TASK AND REQUIRES AS A

01:44:37.337 --> 01:44:41.642
WHOLE RANGE OF SOLUTIONS- IF

01:44:41.708 --> 01:44:50.817
WE'RE GOING TO BE SUCCESSFUL. I

01:44:50.884 --> 01:44:53.587
SEE NO FURTHER QUESTIONS I. HAVE

01:44:53.654 --> 01:44:55.922
ONE LAST WRAP OF QUICK QUESTION

01:44:55.989 --> 01:44:57.891
SO WHEN YOU SAY CRITICAL IN

01:44:57.958 --> 01:45:00.694
TERMS OF CARBON CAPTURE AND

01:45:00.761 --> 01:45:02.562
STORAGE DID THEY HAVE YOU

01:45:02.629 --> 01:45:04.998
IDENTIFIED ANY REALISTIC PATHWAY

01:45:05.065 --> 01:45:07.267
FOR CALIFORNIA TO GET TO GET TO-

01:45:07.334 --> 01:45:09.836
CARBON NEUTRALITY WITHOUT CARBON

01:45:09.903 --> 01:45:14.241
CAPTURE AND STORAGE. THE THAT'S

01:45:14.307 --> 01:45:28.689
A GOOD QUESTION- I. I BELIEVE I

01:45:28.755 --> 01:45:34.361
MEAN I BELIEVE THAT I. YOU COULD

01:45:34.428 --> 01:45:37.798
PROBABLY STILL DO IT. BUT IT

01:45:37.864 --> 01:45:41.902
WOULD REQUIRE- A RANGE OF YOU

01:45:41.968 --> 01:45:43.670
KNOW ADDITIONAL EXPENSIVE

01:45:43.737 --> 01:45:46.473
TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE ALSO NOT

01:45:46.540 --> 01:45:50.077
WIDELY COMMERCIALIZED. ALL RIGHT

01:45:50.143 --> 01:45:52.779
I DON'T SEE A REASON TO TAKE IT

01:45:52.846 --> 01:45:54.414
OFF THE TABLE I WOULDN'T SAY

01:45:54.481 --> 01:45:55.916
DEFINITIVELY THAT IT IS

01:45:55.982 --> 01:46:00.487
IMPOSSIBLE WITH. OKAY THANK YOU

01:46:00.554 --> 01:46:03.190
VERY MUCH TO VISIT MOUNT MAHONE-

01:46:03.256 --> 01:46:04.591

THAT WE HAVE OR NOT- OTHER

01:46:14.835 --> 01:46:17.003
PANELISTS PATIENTLY WAITING TO

01:46:17.070 --> 01:46:19.306
BUT- OUR NEXT SPEAKER FOR OUR

01:46:19.372 --> 01:46:23.243
FIRST PANEL IS ERIN MAYFIELD.

INVITATION AND THE OPPORTUNITY

01:46:58.945 --> 01:47:00.781
TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY ABOUT TO

01:47:00.847 --> 01:47:02.249
CARBONIZED THINGS ECONOMY TO

01:47:02.315 --> 01:47:03.884
MINIMIZE THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE

01:47:03.950 --> 01:47:06.052
CHANGE I WILL TAKE THIS

01:47:06.119 --> 01:47:07.888
OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS THE NET

01:47:07.954 --> 01:47:09.689
ZERO AMERICA PROJECT CARRIED OUT

01:47:09.756 --> 01:47:12.826
BY A PRINCETON LED RESEARCH TEAM

01:47:12.893 --> 01:47:14.027
THIS PROJECT EVALUATED

01:47:14.094 --> 01:47:16.029
ALTERNATIVE PATHWAYS TO ACHIEVE

01:47:16.096 --> 01:47:18.865
NET ZERO EMISSIONS IN THE UNITED

01:48:28.501 --> 01:48:29.703
IN THE FOR NETZERO SCENARIOS

01:48:29.769 --> 01:48:31.438

IN POSSESSION OF PROPERTIES. YOU

01:48:46.286 --> 01:48:48.088
CAN SEE THAT THE FIRST TEN YEARS

01:48:48.154 --> 01:48:50.290
OF THE TRANSITION ARE SIMILAR

01:48:50.357 --> 01:48:51.558
ACROSS ILLNESS IT'S ZERO

01:48:51.625 --> 01:48:53.493
SCENARIOS WITH ISSUE MAKING USE

01:49:18.518 --> 01:49:20.253
WHERE AS THE EPLUS ARI MINUS

01:49:20.320 --> 01:49:21.488
SCENARIO ASSUMES THAT THE

01:49:21.554 --> 01:49:23.723
ABILITY. TO DEPLOY RENEWABLES IS

01:49:23.790 --> 01:49:25.992
CONSTRAINED AND NATURAL GAS WITH

01:49:26.059 --> 01:49:28.495
CARBON CAPTURE- TAKES A MUCH

01:49:28.561 --> 01:49:29.763
LARGER ROLE IN MEETING

01:49:29.829 --> 01:49:31.598
ELECTRICITY DEMAND. COULD YOU

01:49:31.665 --> 01:49:34.668
GIVE A QUICK EXPLANATION OF THE

YOUR- ABBREVIATIONS HERE. SURE

01:49:41.574 --> 01:49:43.276
THE RAFT IS OUR REFERENCE

01:49:43.343 --> 01:49:44.644
SCENARIO RIGHT SO IT'S NOT

01:49:44.711 --> 01:49:47.347
MEETING AFTER- TARGETS- STATIC

01:49:47.414 --> 01:49:49.549
POLICY CASE ESSENTIALLY AND THEN

01:49:49.616 --> 01:49:51.051
THERE'S THE FOR SET NET ZERO

01:49:51.117 --> 01:49:53.386
SCENARIOS EACH CLASS IS- WHAT

01:49:53.453 --> 01:49:56.156
THE- COST EFFECTIVE POLICY. ALL

01:49:56.222 --> 01:49:57.524
ARE COST EFFECTIVE POLICIES BUT

01:49:57.590 --> 01:49:59.559
IT'S ENOUGH CONSIDERING THE MOST

01:49:59.626 --> 01:50:02.729
COST EFFECTIVE POLICY I'M- A AND

01:50:02.796 --> 01:50:03.229
THERE'S A HIGH RATE OF

01:50:03.296 --> 01:50:10.270
ELECTRIFICATION E. MINUS- BEARS. A LOWER RATE OF

01:50:10.337 --> 01:50:11.671
ELECTRIFICATION- ECLASS ARE YOU

01:50:11.738 --> 01:50:13.540
PLUS IS THE MOUNTIE PLUS EXCEPT

01:50:13.606 --> 01:50:18.178
FOR- REQUIRING THAT BY TWENTY

01:50:18.244 --> 01:50:19.813
FIFTY WERE MEETING A 100%

01:50:19.879 --> 01:50:21.681
RENEWABLE OVER 100% RENEWABLE

01:50:21.748 --> 01:50:24.351
TARGET. AND EPLUS ARI MINUS IS

01:50:24.417 --> 01:50:26.252
MEANT TO BE THE OTHER SIDE OF

01:50:26.319 --> 01:50:29.255
THE MOUNTAIN CASE ON. RENEWABLES

01:50:29.322 --> 01:50:32.325
AND INCREASED. THE NATURAL GAS

01:50:32.392 --> 01:50:34.227
AND NATURAL GAS WITH BROTHER

01:50:34.294 --> 01:50:35.895
NATURAL GAS A CARBON CAPTURE

01:50:35.962 --> 01:50:38.565
RIGHT SO- THESE ALL DIFFER IN

01:50:38.631 --> 01:50:40.400
TERMS OF THE RATE OF

01:50:40.467 --> 01:50:42.302
ELECTRIFICATION AND THE

01:50:42.369 --> 01:50:44.104
MAGNITUDE OF RENEWABLE

01:50:44.170 --> 01:50:50.310
DEPLOYMENT- SO. I WOULD ALSO SAY

01:50:50.377 --> 01:50:53.046
THAT FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF

01:50:53.113 --> 01:50:54.848
OVERALL ANNUALIZED ENERGY SYSTEM

01:50:54.914 --> 01:50:57.484
COSTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF GDP ARE

01:50:57.550 --> 01:51:00.053
LOWER FOR ALL NATURAL PATHWAYS

01:51:00.120 --> 01:51:03.690
ACROSS FOR A U. S. Y. A RELATIVE

01:51:03.757 --> 01:51:04.290
TO A REFERENCE CASE SCENARIO

01:51:04.357 --> 01:51:06.359
OVER THE LONG TERM THIS IS OF

01:51:06.426 --> 01:51:08.862
COURSE CONTINGENT ON ROBUST LONG

01:51:08.928 --> 01:51:10.563
TERM PLANNING POLICY AND THE

01:51:10.630 --> 01:51:12.098
ABILITY TO MORE LOCALIZED

01:51:12.165 --> 01:51:13.933
INVESTMENT CAPITAL TO DEPLOY

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:17.370
CRITICAL AND INTEGRATED

01:51:17.437 --> 01:51:20.774
INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS. SO THESE

01:51:20.840 --> 01:51:22.709
TRANSFORMATIONS ARE SUBSTANTIAL

01:51:22.776 --> 01:51:23.710
FROM AN INFRASTRUCTURE

01:51:23.777 --> 01:51:25.578
PERSPECTIVE IT'S ON A NATIONAL

01:51:25.645 --> 01:51:27.113
LEVEL THE DEPLOYMENT RATES OF

01:51:27.180 --> 01:51:28.581
SOLAR WIND AND GREAT

01:51:28.648 --> 01:51:31.217
INFRASTRUCTURE. ARE MUCH HIGHER

01:51:31.284 --> 01:51:32.886
IN ALL OF THEIR NET ZERO

01:51:32.952 --> 01:51:34.421
SCENARIOS THAN HISTORICAL PEAK

01:51:34.487 --> 01:51:37.357
DEPLOYMENT RATES SO FOR THE U.

01:51:37.424 --> 01:51:40.093
S. HISTORICAL. GREAT WAS ABOUT

01:51:40.160 --> 01:51:41.795
TEN GIGAWATTS PER YEAR. ROSS THE

01:51:41.861 --> 01:51:43.263
DIFFERENT AT ZERO SCENARIOS THAT

01:51:43.329 --> 01:51:46.032
WE MODEL. FIFTEEN TO EIGHTY

01:51:46.099 --> 01:51:46.933
GIGAWATTS PER YEAR ON AVERAGE

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:49.335
ACROSS THE US WILL HAVE TO BE

01:51:49.402 --> 01:51:50.470
DEPLOYED AND THAT RATE IS

01:51:50.537 --> 01:51:52.105
UPWARDS OF EIGHT TIMES A START

01:51:52.172 --> 01:51:54.574
WILL PEAK RATE SO OUR RATES ARE

01:51:54.641 --> 01:51:57.877
REQUIRED. UP FOR WINDOW CROSS

01:51:57.944 --> 01:52:00.747
THE LAST. SO TO PUT IT INTO

01:52:00.814 --> 01:52:02.549
OTHER CONTEXTS IN THE FIRST FIVE

01:52:02.615 --> 01:52:04.517
YEARS OF THE TRANSITION THE

01:52:04.584 --> 01:52:05.618
DEPLOYMENT RATE OF SOLAR AND

01:52:05.685 --> 01:52:07.320
WIND WILL HAVE TO BE A PUBLIC TO

01:52:07.387 --> 01:52:08.755
THE STARKEL MAXIMUM DEPLOYMENT

01:52:08.822 --> 01:52:10.657
RATE THAT WE'VE OBSERVED IN THE

01:52:10.723 --> 01:52:12.459
US AND IN THE FIVE YEARS AFTER

01:52:12.525 --> 01:52:13.827
THAT TO TWENTY THIRTY THIS

01:52:13.893 --> 01:52:15.195
DEPLOYMENT RATE WILL HAVE TO

01:52:15.261 --> 01:52:18.231
DOUBLE THE DEPLOYMENT RATE

01:52:18.298 --> 01:52:19.232
CONTINUES TO ACCELERATE THEIR

01:52:19.299 --> 01:52:21.334
AFTER. THERE'S IN A SIMILAR.

01:52:21.401 --> 01:52:22.502
PATTERN FOR TRANSMISSION

01:52:22.569 --> 01:52:24.270
CAPACITY ACROSS THE US WHICH

01:52:24.337 --> 01:52:26.339
NEARLY TRIPLES BY TWENTY FIFTY

01:52:26.406 --> 01:52:27.841
AND TO CONTEXTUALIZE THIS AND

01:52:27.907 --> 01:52:29.309
TALK ABOUT A HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS

01:52:29.375 --> 01:52:31.077
TO BUILD THE CURRENT GRADE. AND

01:52:31.144 --> 01:52:33.213
NOW WE'RE WE HAVE TO BUILD THAT

01:52:33.279 --> 01:52:34.247
MUCH TRANSMISSION IN THE NEXT

01:52:34.314 --> 01:52:35.014
FIFTY YEAR FIFTEEN YEARS AND

01:52:35.081 --> 01:52:37.717
THEN AGAIN. IN THE FIFTEEN YEARS

01:52:37.784 --> 01:52:40.086
AFTER THAT. COME TO PROVIDE

01:52:40.153 --> 01:52:41.387
ADDITIONAL CONTEXT OF THE SCALE

01:52:41.454 --> 01:52:43.723
OF THESE TRANSITIONS THIS MAP IS

01:52:43.790 --> 01:52:45.425
A SMOKE TWENTY TWENTY SNAPSHOT

01:52:45.492 --> 01:52:47.861
OF UTILITY SCALE SOLAR WHICH IS

01:52:47.927 --> 01:52:51.464
SHOWN IN. AN ORANGE WIND IN BLUE

01:52:51.531 --> 01:52:56.402
AND TRANSMISSION IN IN GRAY. AND

01:52:56.469 --> 01:52:59.372
THIS IS A SNAPSHOT IN TWENTY

01:52:59.439 --> 01:53:00.607
FIFTEEN FOR THE ECLASS NETZERO

01:53:00.673 --> 01:53:02.876
PATHWAY THAT WE MODELED SO THIS

01:53:02.942 --> 01:53:06.779
IS ONE POTENTIAL DEPLOYMENT- OF

01:53:06.846 --> 01:53:09.782
BUSINESS ZERO PATHWAY. THAT IS

01:53:09.849 --> 01:53:11.251
RELATIVELY MODERATE IN TERMS OF

01:53:11.317 --> 01:53:12.919
RENEWABLE DEPLOYMENT SO SOLAR

01:53:12.986 --> 01:53:15.522
AND WIND COMPRISE ABOUT 80% OF

01:53:15.588 --> 01:53:18.358
ELECTRICITY SUPPLY ACROSS THE U.

01:53:18.424 --> 01:53:19.759
S. BY TWENTY FIFTY WHICH EQUATES

01:53:19.826 --> 01:53:21.661
TO A TEN FOLD INCREASE IN SOLAR

01:53:21.728 --> 01:53:23.329
AND WIND CAPACITY OVER THE NEXT.

01:53:23.396 --> 01:53:26.332
THIRTY YEARS. OF COURSE THERE'S

01:53:26.399 --> 01:53:27.834
MANY ALTERNATIVE DIPLOMA

01:53:27.901 --> 01:53:29.102
PATHWAYS OF SOLAR WIND AND

01:53:29.169 --> 01:53:30.970
TRANSMISSION INFRASTRUCTURE IN

01:53:31.037 --> 01:53:32.539
CALIFORNIA AND REGIONALLY AND

01:53:32.605 --> 01:53:34.140
THAT WILL IMPACT OR BE

01:53:34.207 --> 01:53:36.543
INFLUENCED BY EQUITY AND JUSTICE

01:53:36.609 --> 01:53:38.878
LAND USE ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL

01:53:38.945 --> 01:53:41.114
OBJECTIVES. BEYOND RENEWABLE

01:53:41.181 --> 01:53:43.883
INFRASTRUCTURE WE ALSO EVALUATED

01:53:43.950 --> 01:53:45.351
TRANSITION OF SEVERAL OTHER

01:53:45.418 --> 01:53:46.586
TYPES OF INFRASTRUCTURE

01:53:46.653 --> 01:53:49.322
INCLUDING THE DEPLOYMENT OF C.

01:53:49.389 --> 01:53:52.825
CO TWO PIPELINES AND FEDERAL

01:53:52.892 --> 01:53:56.863
REQUIREMENTS AND RIPARIAN. SO

01:53:56.930 --> 01:53:58.464
THERE WILL ALSO BE SUBSTANTIAL

01:53:58.531 --> 01:54:00.533
IMPACTS TO LOCAL AND REGIONAL

01:54:00.600 --> 01:54:01.568
ECONOMIES AND SO THIS FIGURE

01:54:01.634 --> 01:54:04.137
SHOWS. THAT POTENTIAL FUTURE OF

01:54:04.204 --> 01:54:06.506
JOB GAINS AND JOB LOSSES

01:54:06.573 --> 01:54:08.775
AGGREGATED BY RESOURCE SECTOR SO

01:54:08.841 --> 01:54:10.643
IT INCLUDES ALL SUPPLY SIDE

01:54:10.710 --> 01:54:12.979
ENERGY RELATED JOBS IN IN

01:54:13.046 --> 01:54:16.549
CALIFORNIA. SO THERE'S A NET JOB

01:54:16.616 --> 01:54:20.220
GAIN- IN IN GRADE RELATED JOBS

01:54:20.286 --> 01:54:22.021
WHICH IS STRONGER BROWN SOLAR

01:54:22.088 --> 01:54:25.325
JOBS AND IN YELLOW. AND GREEN

01:54:25.391 --> 01:54:27.760
JOBS IN BLUE. AND THERE'S A NET

01:54:27.827 --> 01:54:30.263
LOSS IN OIL AT IN RED AND

01:54:30.330 --> 01:54:32.398
NATURAL GAS JOBS IN PURPLE STONE

01:54:32.465 --> 01:54:33.967
AGGREGATE INTERVIEW PLUS

01:54:34.033 --> 01:54:36.736
SCENARIO. THEIR JOB GAINS OFFSET

01:54:36.803 --> 01:54:40.273
JOB LOSSES BUT IN REALITY THOSE-

01:54:40.340 --> 01:54:42.609
WHO LOSE JOBS MAY NOT TRANSITION

01:54:42.675 --> 01:54:44.911
INTO JOBS IN OF THE LOW CARBON

01:54:44.978 --> 01:54:47.847
WORKFORCE. THIS IS WHAT IT LOOKS

01:54:47.914 --> 01:54:51.117
LIKE IN OTHER POTENTIAL FUTURES

01:54:51.184 --> 01:54:52.919
AND SO YOU CAN SEE A RAPID

01:54:52.986 --> 01:54:55.855
GROWTH IN THE ENERGY SECTOR EVEN

01:54:55.922 --> 01:54:57.890
EVEN AT BURKE COUNTING FOR ANY

01:54:57.957 --> 01:54:59.592

POINTS TO THE GROWING UP SIDES

02:05:13.172 --> 02:05:15.040
OF THE EASY TRANSITION- AND

02:05:15.107 --> 02:05:16.575
THAT'S ANOTHER REASON CALIFORNIA

02:05:16.642 --> 02:05:19.612
HAS TO EXCEL RATE THE TIMETABLE

INNOVATION AND FALLING COSTS FOR

02:05:49.041 --> 02:05:49.975
BATTERIES. I'D LIKE TO DRAW YOUR

02:05:50.042 --> 02:05:51.911
ATTENTION TO THE RED CURVES IN

02:06:04.990 --> 02:06:06.692
FOR COST FORECASTS ARE ALMOST

02:06:06.759 --> 02:06:08.527

ACCELERATE CALIFORNIA'S CLIMATE

02:08:08.647 --> 02:08:12.084
TARGETS AND CLIMATE ACTIONS

02:08:12.151 --> 02:08:15.020
COULD NOT BE MORE IMPORTANT- I'D

02:08:15.087 --> 02:08:16.688
LIKE TO EMPHASIZE THE CRITICAL

02:08:16.755 --> 02:08:18.223
ROLE OF CALIFORNIA'S INDUSTRIAL

02:08:18.290 --> 02:08:21.560
SECTOR. IN THIS POLICY PROCESS.

02:08:21.627 --> 02:08:24.163
AND FOCUS ON THE FOLLOWING THREE

02:08:24.229 --> 02:08:27.066
POINTS. FIRST CALIFORNIA CANNOT

02:08:27.132 --> 02:08:30.069
MEET. ITS CLIMATE GOALS WITHOUT

02:08:30.135 --> 02:08:33.205
DRAMATICALLY DECREASING ITS

02:08:33.272 --> 02:08:33.739
INDUSTRIAL GREENHOUSE GAS

02:08:33.806 --> 02:08:36.675
EMISSIONS. SECOND CALIFORNIA'S

02:08:36.742 --> 02:08:38.777
MANUFACTURING SECTOR IS

02:08:38.844 --> 02:08:39.912
ESSENTIAL TO THE SUCCESS OF ITS

02:08:39.978 --> 02:08:41.847
ECONOMY AND THE WELL BEING OF

02:08:41.914 --> 02:08:43.849
ITS CITIZENS SO ALL OF OUR

02:08:43.916 --> 02:08:46.051
ACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL EMISSIONS

02:08:46.118 --> 02:08:47.953
SHOULD BE DESIGNED TO SUPPORT

02:08:48.020 --> 02:08:50.456
AND INCREASE THE SUCCESS OF

02:08:50.522 --> 02:08:53.192
MANUFACTURING IN OUR STATE. AND

02:08:53.258 --> 02:08:55.027
THIRD THE CEMENT INDUSTRY

02:08:55.094 --> 02:08:57.796
PRESENTS A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO

02:08:57.863 --> 02:09:00.632
ADDRESS MULTIPLE GOALS. REDUCING

02:09:00.699 --> 02:09:01.533
OUR STATE GREENHOUSE GAS

02:09:01.600 --> 02:09:04.436
EMISSIONS INCREASING OUR GLOBAL

02:09:04.503 --> 02:09:06.705
GREENHOUSE GAS LEADERSHIP

02:09:06.772 --> 02:09:07.706
MAINTAINING OUR MANUFACTURING

02:09:07.773 --> 02:09:10.075
BASE AND IMPROVING PUBLIC HEALTH

02:09:10.142 --> 02:09:12.144
AND ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ALL AT

02:09:12.211 --> 02:09:15.647
THE SAME TIME. SO LET ME TAKE

02:09:15.714 --> 02:09:17.583
THOSE THREE POINTS ONE. AT A

02:09:17.649 --> 02:09:19.418
TIME AND DIVE A LITTLE DEEPER ON

02:09:19.485 --> 02:09:20.986
EACH STARTING WITH THE

02:09:21.053 --> 02:09:22.521
IMPORTANCE OF CALIFORNIA'S

02:09:22.588 --> 02:09:24.756
INDUSTRIAL EMISSIONS. ALMOST A

02:09:24.823 --> 02:09:26.625
QUARTER OF CALIFORNIA'S

02:09:26.692 --> 02:09:27.860
GREENHOUSE GASES COME FROM

02:09:27.926 --> 02:09:30.896
INDUSTRY. THIS IS SIMPLY TOO

02:09:30.963 --> 02:09:33.098
MUCH TO LEAVE TO THE SINGLE

02:09:33.165 --> 02:09:35.734
POLICY MECHANISM OF THE CAP AND

02:09:35.801 --> 02:09:38.270
TRADE SYSTEM. THESE EMISSIONS

02:09:38.337 --> 02:09:42.174
ARE ROUGHLY SPLIT BETWEEN THE

02:09:42.241 --> 02:09:43.876
UPSTREAM MIDDLES ARE MIDSTREAM

02:09:43.942 --> 02:09:46.011
AND DOWNSTREAM EMISSIONS OF THE

02:09:46.078 --> 02:09:48.647
OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY. AND

02:09:48.714 --> 02:09:50.816
MANUFACTURING ACTIVITIES. MOST

02:09:50.883 --> 02:09:53.652
OF THE TRAJECTORY OF THE OIL AND

02:09:53.719 --> 02:09:54.586
GAS SECTORS GREENHOUSE GAS

02:09:54.653 --> 02:09:56.855
EMISSIONS WILL BE DETERMINED BY

02:09:56.922 --> 02:09:58.123
WHAT HAPPENS IN THE

02:09:58.190 --> 02:10:01.226
TRANSPORTATION SECTOR. AND NOT

02:10:01.293 --> 02:10:02.427
AT THE INDUSTRIAL SITES

02:10:02.494 --> 02:10:03.896
THEMSELVES SO I'M GONNA FOCUS

02:10:03.962 --> 02:10:05.464
THE REST OF MY REMARKS ON THE

02:10:05.531 --> 02:10:06.865
EMISSIONS FROM MANUFACTURING

02:10:06.932 --> 02:10:11.036
ACTIVITIES. SO WHICH BRINGS ME

02:10:11.103 --> 02:10:12.371
TO MY SECOND POINT CALIFORNIA'S

02:10:12.437 --> 02:10:14.339
MANUFACTURING SECTOR IS

02:10:14.406 --> 02:10:16.475
SOMETHING THAT WE CAN ALL BE

02:10:16.542 --> 02:10:18.610
JUSTLY PROUD OFF. HI IT PRODUCES

02:10:18.677 --> 02:10:20.879
APPROXIMATELY THREE HUNDRED

02:10:20.946 --> 02:10:22.681
FIFTY BILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR

02:10:22.748 --> 02:10:25.250
IN ECONOMIC OUTPUT THIS IS THE

02:10:25.317 --> 02:10:27.452
LARGEST MANUFACTURING SECTOR OF

02:10:27.519 --> 02:10:29.621
ANY STATE IN THE UNITED STATES.

02:10:29.688 --> 02:10:31.123
AND THAT'S NOT JUST BECAUSE OUR

02:10:31.190 --> 02:10:32.891
ECONOMY IS THE LARGEST WE

02:10:32.958 --> 02:10:34.426
ACTUALLY HAVE A LARGER

02:10:34.493 --> 02:10:37.663
PERCENTAGE OF OUR STATE ECONOMIC

02:10:37.729 --> 02:10:38.564
OUTPUT COMING FROM

02:10:38.630 --> 02:10:41.466
MANUFACTURING. THEN THE U. S.

02:10:41.533 --> 02:10:48.106
ECONOMY AS A WHOLE- FUSING. AT

02:10:48.173 --> 02:10:49.975
LEAST AS IMPORTANT AS THE

02:10:50.042 --> 02:10:52.611
OVERALL IMPACT ON OUR OUR

02:10:52.678 --> 02:10:55.314
ECONOMIC OUTPUT IS THE QUALITY

02:10:55.380 --> 02:10:57.316
OF THE JOBS THAT THE

02:10:57.382 --> 02:10:59.284
MANUFACTURING SECTOR GENERATES

02:10:59.351 --> 02:11:01.353
THE TOTAL COMPENSATION OF THE

02:11:01.420 --> 02:11:03.722
AVERAGE MANUFACTURING WORKER IN

02:11:03.789 --> 02:11:07.125
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS A

02:11:07.192 --> 02:11:08.126
HUNDRED TWELVE THOUSAND DOLLARS

02:11:08.193 --> 02:11:10.662
PER YEAR. THIS IS WAY ABOVE

02:11:10.729 --> 02:11:13.632
AVERAGE AND AS SUCH. AW THE

02:11:13.699 --> 02:11:16.068
CALIFORNIA THE MANUFACTURING%

02:11:16.134 --> 02:11:19.037
SECTOR PROVIDES CRITICAL LADDER

02:11:19.104 --> 02:11:21.506
INTO THE MIDDLE CLASS FOR A WIDE

02:11:21.573 --> 02:11:23.075
VARIETY OF CALIFORNIANS

02:11:23.141 --> 02:11:25.377
INCLUDING THOSE WHO DON'T HAVE

02:11:25.444 --> 02:11:26.411
THE BENEFIT OF A COLLEGE

02:11:26.478 --> 02:11:31.049
EDUCATION. HOWEVER IN SPITE OF

02:11:31.116 --> 02:11:33.285
ALL OF THIS BY FAR THE SIMPLEST

02:11:33.352 --> 02:11:35.254
AND MOST DIRECT ROUTE TO

02:11:35.320 --> 02:11:36.822
DECARBONIZE OUR MANUFACTURING

02:11:36.888 --> 02:11:40.058
SECTOR IS ALSO THE WORST IT'S

02:11:40.125 --> 02:11:42.361
SIMPLY TO SHUT DOWN THE

02:11:42.427 --> 02:11:44.396
FACILITIES. THAT WOULD ELIMINATE

02:11:44.463 --> 02:11:46.431
THE EMISSIONS DIRECTLY BUT IT

02:11:46.498 --> 02:11:50.435
WOULD CAUSE ALL MANNER OF OUR

02:11:50.502 --> 02:11:52.537
ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL PROBLEMS

02:11:52.604 --> 02:11:54.940
HERE IN CALIFORNIA WELL FAILING

02:11:55.007 --> 02:11:56.275
TO ACTUALLY REDUCE GREENHOUSE

02:11:56.341 --> 02:11:59.611
GAS EMISSIONS ON A GLOBAL BASIS

02:11:59.678 --> 02:12:02.314
. SO TO AVOID THE US WE NEED A

02:12:02.381 --> 02:12:04.483
COMBINATION OF POLICIES. THAT

02:12:04.549 --> 02:12:07.853
REQUIRE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS

02:12:07.919 --> 02:12:11.023
REDUCTIONS AT FACILITIES WITH

02:12:11.089 --> 02:12:13.392
AND USE THOSE IN COMBINATION

02:12:13.458 --> 02:12:14.726
WITH POLICIES THAT CREATE

02:12:14.793 --> 02:12:16.728
BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE

02:12:16.795 --> 02:12:19.298
CLEANEST FIRMS. WHEN POLICIES

02:12:19.364 --> 02:12:21.300
THAT SUPPORT INNOVATION IN

02:12:21.366 --> 02:12:23.535
TECHNOLOGY MARKETS AND BUSINESS

02:12:23.602 --> 02:12:26.605
MODELS. SO FINALLY TO ILLUSTRATE

02:12:26.672 --> 02:12:28.407
HOW ALL OF THIS MIGHT WORK I

02:12:28.473 --> 02:12:31.109
WANT TO FOCUS FOR THE LAST FEW

02:12:31.176 --> 02:12:33.412
MINUTES OF MY- TESTIMONY ON THE

02:12:33.478 --> 02:12:37.349
CEMENT SECTOR. THE CEMENT SECTOR

02:12:37.416 --> 02:12:39.518
IS THE LARGEST SOURCE OF

02:12:39.584 --> 02:12:41.286
MANUFACTURING GREENHOUSE GAS

02:12:41.353 --> 02:12:41.820
EMISSIONS IN THE STATE OF

02:12:41.887 --> 02:12:44.523
CALIFORNIA. WITH BETWEEN TWO AND

02:12:44.589 --> 02:12:48.427
3% OF TOTAL STATE EMISSIONS. AT

02:12:48.493 --> 02:12:50.929
THAT LEVEL IT'S ESSENTIAL THAT

02:12:50.996 --> 02:12:54.199
WE REDUCE THESE EMISSIONS. JUST

02:12:54.266 --> 02:12:55.334
IN ORDER TO MEET OUR OVERALL

02:12:55.400 --> 02:12:56.902
CHEMICALS THAT'S THAT'S TOO MANY

02:12:56.968 --> 02:12:59.304
TONS OF GREENHOUSE GASES FOR US

02:12:59.371 --> 02:13:02.908
TO IGNORE. HOWEVER GLOBALLY THE

02:13:02.974 --> 02:13:05.243
CEMENT SECTOR IS RESPONSIBLE FOR

02:13:05.310 --> 02:13:07.479
BETWEEN SEVEN AND 8% OF

02:13:07.546 --> 02:13:09.815
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. SO IF

02:13:09.881 --> 02:13:12.384
CALIFORNIA CONTENT DEMONSTRATE

02:13:12.451 --> 02:13:15.220
TECHNICAL POLICY AND BUSINESS

02:13:15.287 --> 02:13:18.557
FEASIBILITY OF GENUINELY LOW OR

02:13:18.623 --> 02:13:21.727
NEAR ZERO GREENHOUSE GAS CEMENT

02:13:21.793 --> 02:13:22.627
PRODUCTION. THAT'S A HUGE

02:13:22.694 --> 02:13:23.862
OPPORTUNITY FOR GLOBAL

02:13:23.929 --> 02:13:26.031
LEADERSHIP THIS IS A REALLY HIGH

02:13:26.098 --> 02:13:27.632
LEVERAGE OPPORTUNITY FOR

02:13:27.699 --> 02:13:30.435
CALIFORNIA SO WE NEED TO DO IT

02:13:30.502 --> 02:13:32.738
FOR IT FOR OURSELVES. BUT IT'S A

02:13:32.804 --> 02:13:35.841
GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO

02:13:35.907 --> 02:13:38.009
CONTRIBUTE TO SOLVING THE

02:13:38.076 --> 02:13:43.115
PROBLEM GLOBALLY- AS OF RIGHT

02:13:43.181 --> 02:13:47.853
NOW NO ONE HAS FIGURED OUT HOW

02:13:47.919 --> 02:13:52.791
TO HAVE A GENUINELY ZERO OR NEAR

02:13:52.858 --> 02:13:53.792
ZERO GREENHOUSE GAS CEMENT

02:13:53.859 --> 02:13:56.495
INDUSTRY. SO CALIFORNIA CAN BE A

02:13:56.561 --> 02:13:59.097
TRAILBLAZER HERE. IN ADDITION TO

02:13:59.164 --> 02:14:01.600
THESE CONSIDERATIONS ALL I TWO

02:14:01.666 --> 02:14:04.770
MORE FIRST. AS WE JUST HEARD

02:14:04.836 --> 02:14:07.005
FROM ALL OF THE PREVIOUS

02:14:07.072 --> 02:14:10.008
SPEAKERS IN ORDER TO MEET OUR

02:14:10.075 --> 02:14:11.810
OVERALL ECONOMY WIDE CLIMATE

02:14:11.877 --> 02:14:14.045
GOALS WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO

02:14:14.112 --> 02:14:16.348
BUILD A LOT OF STUFF WE'RE GOING

02:14:16.415 --> 02:14:17.449
TO HAVE TO BUILD NEW HOUSING NEW

02:14:17.516 --> 02:14:19.217
INFRASTRUCTURE NEW TRANSMISSION

02:14:19.284 --> 02:14:22.154
LINES ALL OF THAT IS GOING TO

02:14:22.220 --> 02:14:23.522
REQUIRE CEMENT AND CONCRETE WE

02:14:23.588 --> 02:14:26.358
DO NOT WANT OUR ACTIONS. TO

02:14:26.425 --> 02:14:27.993
ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE TO

02:14:28.059 --> 02:14:30.462
THEMSELVES BECOME DRIVERS OF

02:14:30.529 --> 02:14:31.296
ADDITIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS

02:14:31.363 --> 02:14:33.131
EMISSIONS THROUGH THE DIRTY

02:14:33.198 --> 02:14:36.067
BUILDING MATERIALS THAT ALL OF

02:14:36.134 --> 02:14:38.737
THIS CLEAN STUFF IS MADE OUT OF

02:14:38.804 --> 02:14:41.740
. SECOND CEMENT FACILITIES IN

02:14:41.807 --> 02:14:44.810
CALIFORNIA ARE NOTABLY DIRTY IN

02:14:44.876 --> 02:14:46.912
THE SENSE THAT THEY ARE THEY

02:14:46.978 --> 02:14:48.480
HAVE A DISPROPORTIONATE A

02:14:48.547 --> 02:14:52.684
MISSIONS OF THE LOCAL POLLUTANTS

02:14:52.751 --> 02:14:54.486
ARE BOTH CRITERIA AIR POLLUTANTS

02:14:54.553 --> 02:14:57.989
AND AIR TOXICS THAT HAVE A VERY

02:14:58.056 --> 02:15:00.192
MALIGN EFFECT ON THE COMMUNITIES

02:15:00.258 --> 02:15:02.527
THAT LIVE AROUND THEM CEMENT

02:15:02.594 --> 02:15:04.463
KILNS ARE THE ONLY FACILITIES

02:15:04.529 --> 02:15:06.298
LEFT IN CALIFORNIA THAT STILL

02:15:06.364 --> 02:15:10.268
RELY PRIMARILY ON BURNING COAL

02:15:10.335 --> 02:15:14.873
FOR THEIR ENERGY AND POTS- AND

02:15:14.940 --> 02:15:16.508
BECAUSE THESE ARE RELATIVELY

02:15:16.575 --> 02:15:18.777
SMALL FACILITIES AND BECAUSE SO

02:15:18.844 --> 02:15:20.479
MUCH OF THE ATTENTION HAS BEEN

02:15:20.545 --> 02:15:23.482
FOCUSED ON POWER GENERATION. AW

02:15:23.548 --> 02:15:25.517
THEY'VE CUT THEY'VE MANAGED TO

02:15:25.584 --> 02:15:28.019
SLIP BY UNDER THE RADAR FOR MANY

02:15:28.086 --> 02:15:31.356
YEARS. SO FOR ALL THESE REASONS

02:15:31.423 --> 02:15:35.126
CEMENT IS CRITICAL. AND TO DO IT

02:15:35.193 --> 02:15:36.862
WE NEED A COMPREHENSIVE POLICY

02:15:36.928 --> 02:15:39.798
APPROACH WE CAN BUILD ON THE

02:15:39.865 --> 02:15:41.299
FOUNDATION FROM CAP OF CAP AND

02:15:41.366 --> 02:15:44.569
TRADE APPS BY INCREASING AND

02:15:44.636 --> 02:15:46.204
BETTER TARGETING THE FINANCIAL

02:15:46.271 --> 02:15:48.640
INCENTIVE TO CAP AND TRADE

02:15:48.707 --> 02:15:50.642
CREATES TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS

02:15:50.709 --> 02:15:51.176
EMISSIONS AND ADDRESS THE

02:15:51.243 --> 02:15:54.112
OVERHANG OF BANK EMISSIONS THAT

02:15:54.179 --> 02:15:56.948
BOB MY COLLEAGUES ON THE PANEL

02:15:57.015 --> 02:16:01.586
ALREADY MENTIONED. SECOND. WE

02:16:01.653 --> 02:16:04.723
NEED TO SUPPORT INNOVATION ARE

02:16:04.789 --> 02:16:07.158
UNLIKE MANY INDUSTRIES LESS THAN

02:16:07.225 --> 02:16:08.493
HALF OF THE GREENHOUSE GAS

02:16:08.560 --> 02:16:10.262
EMISSIONS FROM THE CEMENT

02:16:10.328 --> 02:16:11.129
INDUSTRY COMES FROM ENERGY

02:16:11.196 --> 02:16:14.366
EMISSIONS WITH MOST COMING FROM

02:16:14.432 --> 02:16:16.501
THE RAW MATERIALS IT'S LITERALLY

02:16:16.568 --> 02:16:18.803
CO TWO COMING STRAIGHT OUT OF

02:16:18.870 --> 02:16:21.206
THE ROCKS. AND AS SUCH ALL THE

02:16:21.273 --> 02:16:22.974
CLEAN ENERGY IN THE WORLD WILL

02:16:23.041 --> 02:16:25.510
AT BEST GET US MAYBE 40%

02:16:25.577 --> 02:16:27.112
EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS FROM THIS

02:16:27.178 --> 02:16:30.782
CRITICAL SECTOR. SO INNOVATION

02:16:30.849 --> 02:16:32.918
IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT HERE.

02:16:32.984 --> 02:16:34.052
AND WE'VE HAD A LOT OF

02:16:34.119 --> 02:16:35.186
DISCUSSION TODAY ABOUT CARBON

02:16:35.253 --> 02:16:37.055
CAPTURE AND STORAGE. AND MY

02:16:37.122 --> 02:16:41.560
ATTITUDE IS. IF WE HAVE OP IF WE

02:16:41.626 --> 02:16:43.161
DECIDE EVEN IF WE DECIDE THAT WE

02:16:43.228 --> 02:16:44.963
DON'T WANT TO USE CARBON CAPTURE

02:16:45.030 --> 02:16:46.398
AND STORAGE IN ANY OTHER PART OF

02:16:46.464 --> 02:16:48.400
OUR ECONOMY. THE PLACE WHERE IT

02:16:48.466 --> 02:16:50.869
IS MOST LIKELY TO BE ESSENTIAL

02:16:50.936 --> 02:16:52.604
TO MEETING OUR CLIMATE GOALS IS

02:16:52.671 --> 02:16:56.174
IN THE CEMENT INDUSTRY- SO IF WE

02:16:56.241 --> 02:16:58.276
WANT TO TAKE ACTION ON. FIFTY S.

02:16:58.343 --> 02:17:01.880
CEMENT IS THE PLACE TO START- SO

02:17:01.947 --> 02:17:03.748
WE NEED TO SUPPORT TECHNOLOGY

02:17:03.815 --> 02:17:07.886
INNOVATION DIRECTLY- AND TO

02:17:07.953 --> 02:17:09.588
FACILITATE EARLY DEPLOYMENTS

02:17:09.654 --> 02:17:10.889
WITH THINGS LIKE SUPPORTING

02:17:10.956 --> 02:17:13.124
INFRASTRUCTURE BOTH FINANCIALLY

02:17:13.191 --> 02:17:14.292
AND ALSO SUPPORTING AND

02:17:14.359 --> 02:17:15.293
NECESSARY INFRASTRUCTURE

02:17:15.360 --> 02:17:17.062
PLANNING AND PERMITTING

02:17:17.128 --> 02:17:18.597
REGULATORY SUPPORT FOR

02:17:18.663 --> 02:17:22.133
GEOLOGICAL STORAGE- AND TAKING

02:17:22.200 --> 02:17:23.668
ADVANTAGE OF THE ABUNDANCE

02:17:23.735 --> 02:17:25.470
FEDERAL MONEY FROM THE RECENT

02:17:25.537 --> 02:17:26.771
INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT AND

02:17:26.838 --> 02:17:29.007
JOBS ACT. THAT IS AVAILABLE TO

02:17:29.074 --> 02:17:30.175
STATES WHO WISH TO BE AGGRESSIVE

02:17:30.241 --> 02:17:33.445
ON THIS TOPIC AND I WANT TO

02:17:33.511 --> 02:17:34.412
POINT OUT THE CALIFORNIA CEMENT

02:17:34.479 --> 02:17:36.848
COMPANIES. ALONG WITH CALIFORNIA

02:17:36.915 --> 02:17:39.818
LABOR UNIONS. AND CALIFORNIA

02:17:39.884 --> 02:17:42.854
ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS ALL REALIZE

02:17:42.921 --> 02:17:44.823
THE NEED FOR THIS ACTION. THE

02:17:44.889 --> 02:17:46.524
CEMENT COMPANIES UNDERSTAND

02:17:46.591 --> 02:17:47.692
WHICH DIRECTION HISTORY IS

02:17:47.759 --> 02:17:50.061
MOVING IN AND THEY WOULD LIKE TO

02:17:50.128 --> 02:17:51.396
DECARBONISE THE FACILITIES

02:17:51.463 --> 02:17:52.931
PROVIDED THAT WE CAN CREATE A

02:17:52.998 --> 02:17:56.401
POLICY SITUATION. THAT ALLOWS

02:17:56.468 --> 02:17:58.203
THEM TO DO THAT WITHOUT LOSING

02:17:58.269 --> 02:18:00.205
MONEY. FINALLY WE NEED POLICIES

02:18:00.271 --> 02:18:02.040
THAT CREATE MARKETS FOR CLEAN

02:18:02.107 --> 02:18:05.510
CEMENT. CALIFORNIA IS A GLOBAL

02:18:05.577 --> 02:18:07.879
LEADER IN ITS BY CLEAN POLICY TO

02:18:07.946 --> 02:18:09.914
BUY CLEAN BUILDING MATERIALS FOR

02:18:09.981 --> 02:18:10.749
STATE FUNDED TRANSPORTATION

02:18:10.815 --> 02:18:12.951
PROJECTS WITHOUT POLICY ACTUALLY

02:18:13.018 --> 02:18:14.386
EXEMPTS THE MOST IMPORTANT

02:18:14.452 --> 02:18:15.854
BUILDING MATERIAL NAMELY CEMENT

02:18:15.920 --> 02:18:19.157
OR CONCRETE- WE SHOULD ALSO BE

02:18:19.224 --> 02:18:20.892
EXPLORING POLICIES. LIKE THE

02:18:20.959 --> 02:18:22.661
CLEAN PRODUCT STANDARDS

02:18:22.727 --> 02:18:24.696
ADDRESSING EMBODIED CARBON

02:18:24.763 --> 02:18:26.131
THROUGH OTHER AN INTERESTING

02:18:26.197 --> 02:18:27.966
ADDRESSING EMBODIED CARBON IN

02:18:28.033 --> 02:18:29.067
THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT THROUGH

02:18:29.134 --> 02:18:30.802
OTHER MECHANISMS LIKE THROUGH

02:18:30.869 --> 02:18:34.439
OUR BUILDING CODES. SO IN THE UC

02:18:34.506 --> 02:18:36.341
CONCLUSION WE NEED TO DDRESS

02:18:36.408 --> 02:18:38.309
INDUSTRIAL GREENHOUSE GASES IT'S

02:18:38.376 --> 02:18:39.978
NOT OPTIONAL WE NEED TO DO IT IN

02:18:40.045 --> 02:18:41.780
A WAY THAT SUPPORTS AND

02:18:41.846 --> 02:18:42.847
STRENGTHENS OUR MANUFACTURING

02:18:42.914 --> 02:18:44.582
SECTOR. AND A COMPREHENSIVE

02:18:44.649 --> 02:18:46.418
POLICY APPROACH INCLUDING

02:18:46.484 --> 02:18:48.486
REGULATION INNOVATION AND MARKET

02:18:48.553 --> 02:18:51.556
CREATION IS A WAY TO MAKE THAT

02:18:51.623 --> 02:18:53.358
HAPPEN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR

02:18:53.425 --> 02:18:55.627
YOUR TIME AND I LOOK FORWARD TO

02:18:55.694 --> 02:18:56.728
YOUR QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY

02:18:56.795 --> 02:18:58.963
MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH LAST

02:18:59.030 --> 02:19:00.899
BUT NOT LEAST TOOK- WE WOULD

02:19:00.965 --> 02:19:05.537
LIKE TO- INVITES TO DOCTOR DAN

02:19:05.603 --> 02:19:08.139
KAMIN PROFESSOR OF ENERGY- UC

02:19:08.206 --> 02:19:22.887
BERKELEY.

02:19:22.954 --> 02:19:24.189
MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'D

02:19:24.255 --> 02:19:25.824
LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR THE CHANCE

02:19:25.890 --> 02:19:27.092
TO SPEAK TODAY I REALLY

02:19:27.158 --> 02:19:28.226
APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT YOU'RE

02:19:28.293 --> 02:19:30.762
DOING BECAUSE AS YOU'VE HEARD

02:19:30.829 --> 02:19:32.764
FROM A COMBINATION OF MODELING

02:19:32.831 --> 02:19:34.933
PERSPECTIVES TODAY AND FROM

02:19:34.999 --> 02:19:37.035
SPECIFIC SECTORAL APPROACHES WE

02:19:37.102 --> 02:19:38.636
NEED TO ACCELERATE THE

02:19:38.703 --> 02:19:40.672
ACTIVITIES IN CALIFORNIA NOT

02:19:40.739 --> 02:19:42.340
ONLY FOR OUR OWN BENEFIT BEFORE

02:19:42.407 --> 02:19:44.042
THE GOAL BENEFIT. AND THAT

02:19:44.109 --> 02:19:45.376
REALLY STARTS WITH THE WORK OF

02:19:45.443 --> 02:19:47.045
THIS COMMITTEE SO I WILL TRY TO

02:19:47.112 --> 02:19:49.481
SKIP OVER ELEMENTS OF MY OF MY

02:19:49.547 --> 02:19:50.548
COMMENTS THAT WERE ADDRESSED BY

02:19:50.615 --> 02:19:52.283
OTHERS I GUESS I WANT TO

02:19:52.350 --> 02:19:54.219
HIGHLIGHT TWO THINGS THAT I

02:19:54.285 --> 02:19:55.920
HEARD CLEARLY IN THE OF IN THE

02:19:55.987 --> 02:19:57.822
PRIOR TO SPEAKERS DR BUSH INTO A

02:19:57.889 --> 02:20:00.325
DOCTOR DEL. AND THAT IS WE HAVE

02:20:00.391 --> 02:20:03.261
SPECIFIC SECTORAL OPPORTUNITIES

02:20:03.328 --> 02:20:04.729
THAT WILL NOT UNFORTUNATELY

02:20:04.796 --> 02:20:07.065
EMERGE FROM LARGE SCALE MODELING

02:20:07.132 --> 02:20:09.567
EFFORTS I AM MYSELF A PHYSICIST

02:20:09.634 --> 02:20:11.202
AND ENERGY MODELER I'VE BEEN

02:20:11.269 --> 02:20:12.804
DOING ENERGY MODELING FOR TWENTY

02:20:12.871 --> 02:20:15.440
YEARS MALAI SWITCH MODEL IS ONE

02:20:15.507 --> 02:20:16.975
OF THE ONES THE STATE IS USED

02:20:17.041 --> 02:20:18.476
OVER AND OVER AGAIN IT'S BEEN

02:20:18.543 --> 02:20:19.711
SUPPORTED BY THE CCV ARP

02:20:19.778 --> 02:20:23.214
OVERTIME. AND MODELS ARE

02:20:23.281 --> 02:20:25.216
INHERENTLY CONSERVATIVE AND I

02:20:25.283 --> 02:20:27.185
DON'T MEAN WE DON'T LOOK AT

02:20:27.252 --> 02:20:28.953
SCENARIOS THAT ARE FAR AND WIDE

02:20:29.020 --> 02:20:32.157
WHAT I MEAN IS THAT MODELS TEND

02:20:32.223 --> 02:20:33.525
TO BE REACTIVE. WHEN SOMETHING

02:20:33.591 --> 02:20:35.293
GOES RIGHT LIKE THE PUSH TO

02:20:35.360 --> 02:20:37.962
ELECTRIC VEHICLES OR EFFORTS TO

02:20:38.029 --> 02:20:40.331
DEPLOY HEAT PUMPS OR BATTERIES.

02:20:40.398 --> 02:20:43.301
MODELS GRAB ONTO IT AND PROJECT

02:20:43.368 --> 02:20:45.336
DRAMATIC IMPROVEMENTS OVER TIME.

02:20:45.403 --> 02:20:47.105
THAT'S WHAT WE DO WHETHER IT'S

02:20:47.172 --> 02:20:49.207
THE INTERNATIONAL ENERGY AGENCY

02:20:49.274 --> 02:20:51.242
THE E. THREE MODEL MICE WHICH

02:20:51.309 --> 02:20:52.644
MODEL THE REFLEX MODEL ANY OF

02:20:52.710 --> 02:20:54.879
THEM. THAT'S NOT A CRITICISM OF

02:20:54.946 --> 02:20:57.315
MODELS. WHAT MODELS ARE BEST AT

02:20:57.382 --> 02:20:59.984
IS CHARTING LEAST COST LEAST

02:21:00.051 --> 02:21:02.754
RISK STRATEGIES NOT ACTUALLY IN

02:21:02.821 --> 02:21:05.857
LAYING OUT BOLD ACTIONS TO BEGIN

02:21:05.924 --> 02:21:06.958
WITH SO I WANTED TO SPEND A

02:21:07.025 --> 02:21:10.028
MINUTE. CONGRATULATING THE STATE

02:21:10.094 --> 02:21:11.095
FOR WHAT WE'VE DONE BECAUSE I

02:21:11.162 --> 02:21:11.996
THINK IT REALLY SETS THE

02:21:12.063 --> 02:21:13.998
OPPORTUNITY IN THE AGENDA AND I

02:21:14.065 --> 02:21:16.234
GO BACK TO SOME OF THE BILLS

02:21:16.301 --> 02:21:17.969
THAT- OF THAT THAT THAT THAT

02:21:18.036 --> 02:21:20.438
THAT AFTER JUST OUTRAGEOUS ANTI

02:21:20.505 --> 02:21:21.406
SKINNER PASSED IN OTHERS THAT

02:21:21.472 --> 02:21:22.874
HIGHLIGHTED AGGRESSIVE

02:21:22.941 --> 02:21:24.175
ACTIVITIES IN RESTAURANTS AND

02:21:24.242 --> 02:21:25.777
SOME OF THE THINGS THAT- THAT

02:21:25.844 --> 02:21:28.913
CENTER BECKER HAS DONE IN TERMS

02:21:28.980 --> 02:21:30.481
OF LOOKING ECONOMY WIDE. WHEN

02:21:30.548 --> 02:21:32.617
CALIFORNIA PASSED SB ONE THE

02:21:32.684 --> 02:21:34.619
MILLION SOLAR ROOF MANDATE. THE

02:21:34.686 --> 02:21:36.554
GLOBAL STATEMENT WAS IT'S NOT

02:21:36.621 --> 02:21:38.723
POSSIBLE IN THE TIME TO SEE IN

02:21:38.790 --> 02:21:39.724
THE TIME SCANNED CALIFORNIA

02:21:39.791 --> 02:21:41.993
SENATE. WE MET THAT GOAL. WHEN

02:21:42.060 --> 02:21:43.761
CALIFORNIA SET THE GOAL FOR

02:21:43.828 --> 02:21:45.230
MILLION ELECTRIC VEHICLES WE

02:21:45.296 --> 02:21:46.831
DIDN'T MAKE IT EXACTLY THE TEN

02:21:46.898 --> 02:21:49.400
YEARS. BUT YOU CAN ARGUE THAT

02:21:49.467 --> 02:21:51.369
NOT ONLY THAT MANDATE BUT MANY

02:21:51.436 --> 02:21:52.937
OF THE OTHER PIECES THE LOW

02:21:53.004 --> 02:21:54.339
CARBON FUEL STANDARD THAT I

02:21:54.405 --> 02:21:56.374
HELPED TO WRITE A NUMBER OF

02:21:56.441 --> 02:21:57.876
OTHER FEATURES. BROUGHT NOT ONLY

02:21:57.942 --> 02:21:59.477
A MILLION ELECTRIC VEHICLES TO

02:21:59.544 --> 02:22:01.846
CALIFORNIA. BUT IT ALSO

02:22:01.913 --> 02:22:03.882
ACCELERATE THE GLOBAL PROSPECTS.

02:22:03.948 --> 02:22:07.018
I WORKED HARD ON ASSEMBLY BILL

02:22:07.085 --> 02:22:08.186
TWENTY FIVE FOURTEEN THE CALL

02:22:08.253 --> 02:22:09.854
FOR THE ONE POINT TWO GIGA WATTS

02:22:09.921 --> 02:22:11.823
OF ENERGY STORAGE IN CALIFORNIA

02:22:11.890 --> 02:22:14.292
BY TWENTY TWENTY. SOMETHING THAT

02:22:14.359 --> 02:22:16.361
WAS ALSO SAID TO BE IMPOSSIBLE.

02:22:16.427 --> 02:22:18.963
WE NOW IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE HAD

02:22:19.030 --> 02:22:20.865
THE MOSS LANDING STORAGE PLANT.

02:22:20.932 --> 02:22:24.035
GO ONLINE WITH PLANS TO EQUAL

02:22:24.102 --> 02:22:27.906
THE ENTIRE CAPACITY. OF TWENTY

02:22:27.972 --> 02:22:29.707
FIVE FOURTEEN ONE POINT TWO

02:22:29.774 --> 02:22:30.341
GIGAWATTS BY TWENTY TWENTY BY

02:22:30.408 --> 02:22:32.343
THE END OF THIS YEAR OR EARLY

02:22:32.410 --> 02:22:34.279
NEXT YEAR. THOSE ARE ALL ACTIONS

02:22:34.345 --> 02:22:36.381
THAT I WISH WE AS ENERGY

02:22:36.447 --> 02:22:39.617
MODELERS HAD FORECAST. BUT IN

02:22:39.684 --> 02:22:41.486
EVERY SINGLE CASE WE DID NOT.

02:22:41.552 --> 02:22:43.321
WHAT HAPPENED IN EACH CASE WAS A

02:22:43.388 --> 02:22:45.957
BOLD ACTION BY A MIXTURE OF

02:22:46.024 --> 02:22:47.592
CALIFORNIA SENATE ASSEMBLY

02:22:47.659 --> 02:22:49.961
COMMITTEES. CONVERSATIONS WITH

02:22:50.028 --> 02:22:51.696
INDUSTRY TO HIGHLIGHT WHAT WAS

02:22:51.763 --> 02:22:52.997
POSSIBLE I KNOW THAT'S THE

02:22:53.064 --> 02:22:54.966
HISTORY YOU WILL KNOW. BUT IT'S

02:22:55.033 --> 02:22:56.334
CRITICAL IN THINKING THROUGH THE

02:22:56.401 --> 02:22:58.903
NEXT STEPS TO GET US BACK ON

02:22:58.970 --> 02:23:01.239
TRACK AS AS DR BUSH'S AS AS

02:23:01.306 --> 02:23:02.507
HIGHLIGHTED WE NEED TO DO THAT

02:23:02.573 --> 02:23:04.542
AND THE CRITICAL MESSAGE OF MY

02:23:04.609 --> 02:23:06.344
TESTIMONY. IS THAT WHILE

02:23:06.411 --> 02:23:09.447
CALIFORNIA IS NOT CURRENTLY ON

02:23:09.514 --> 02:23:10.982
PATH TO MEET THOSE TARGETS.

02:23:11.049 --> 02:23:12.850
GETTING ON THOSE ARE GETTING

02:23:12.917 --> 02:23:15.253
BACK ON THAT PATHWAY WILL BE

02:23:15.320 --> 02:23:17.021
GOOD FOR THE CLIMATE GOOD FOR

02:23:17.088 --> 02:23:18.523
THE LOCAL ENVIRONMENT THE MOST

02:23:18.589 --> 02:23:20.058
CRITICALLY GOOD FOR CALIFORNIA

02:23:20.124 --> 02:23:22.794
JOBS. AT THE POINTS THAT WE WERE

02:23:22.860 --> 02:23:25.029
PUSHING THOSE SOLAR STORAGE AND

02:23:25.096 --> 02:23:27.231
OTHER MANDATES. CALIFORNIA WAS

02:23:27.298 --> 02:23:30.335
BRINGING IN UP 240% OF TOTAL

02:23:30.401 --> 02:23:32.804
NATIONAL FUNDING FOR VENTURE

02:23:32.870 --> 02:23:34.539
CAPITAL THE CLEANTECH SPACE.

02:23:34.605 --> 02:23:36.441
THAT IS FULL OF THE THAT'S THE

02:23:36.507 --> 02:23:38.176
OPPORTUNITY ON THE LEGACY HERE

02:23:38.242 --> 02:23:39.877
AND SO AGAIN I'M TO SKIP OVER

02:23:39.944 --> 02:23:41.612
MANY OF THE DETAILS BUT TO TRY

02:23:41.679 --> 02:23:43.581
TO REMAIN ON TARGET. LET ME JUST

02:23:43.648 --> 02:23:45.616
HIGHLIGHT ONE LAST POINT AND

02:23:45.683 --> 02:23:47.251
THEN GO TO A SET OF

02:23:47.318 --> 02:23:48.586
RECOMMENDATIONS. THE FIRST IS

02:23:48.653 --> 02:23:50.254
THE CALIFORNIA'S UNFORTUNATELY

02:23:50.321 --> 02:23:52.590
DONE ITSELF SOME SIGNIFICANT

02:23:52.657 --> 02:23:54.459
RECENT DAMAGE. ONE OF THOSE

02:23:54.525 --> 02:23:57.562
AREAS IS THE WELL MEANING BUT

02:23:57.628 --> 02:24:00.198
VERY PROBLEMATIC DETAILS. OF THE

02:24:00.264 --> 02:24:01.566
PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION

02:24:01.632 --> 02:24:03.601
PROPOSED RULING ON SOLAR. THAT

02:24:03.668 --> 02:24:06.804
HAS DESTROYED CONFIDENCE IN THE

02:24:06.871 --> 02:24:07.805
AGGRESSIVE MOVING FORWARD IN

02:24:07.872 --> 02:24:10.608
SOLAR. AND WITH SOLAR AND WIND

02:24:10.675 --> 02:24:12.610
NOW THE CHEAPEST NEW FORMS OF

02:24:12.677 --> 02:24:14.045
ENERGY TECHNOLOGY SOMETHING WE

02:24:14.112 --> 02:24:15.546
HEAR ALL THE TIME BUT THE

02:24:15.613 --> 02:24:18.449
CONTEXT IS IT IS NOW CHEAPER TO

02:24:18.516 --> 02:24:20.985
BUILD NEW SOLAR AND WIND ENERGY

02:24:21.052 --> 02:24:23.855
FACILITIES. THEN IT IS TO

02:24:23.921 --> 02:24:25.990
OPERATE FOSSIL FUEL PLANTS. AND

02:24:26.057 --> 02:24:28.359
EVEN WHEN WE ADD IN STORAGE TO

02:24:28.426 --> 02:24:30.528
THAT MIX SO SOLAR PLUS STORAGE

02:24:30.595 --> 02:24:33.064
OR WIND PLUS STORAGE THOSE

02:24:33.131 --> 02:24:34.832
FACILITIES ARE ALSO NOT ONLY

02:24:34.899 --> 02:24:38.136
CHEAPER. BUT THEY GENERATE

02:24:38.202 --> 02:24:41.305
TWENTY TO A 100% MORE JOBS IN

02:24:41.372 --> 02:24:43.141
THE FOSSIL FUEL OPPORTUNITIES

02:24:43.207 --> 02:24:44.776
AND THIS I THINK IS ONE OF THE

02:24:44.842 --> 02:24:46.544
REALLY EXCELLENT POINTS THAT

02:24:46.611 --> 02:24:47.211
ASSEMBLY MEMBER OF FLOOR BROUGHT

02:24:47.278 --> 02:24:49.213
UP AND THAT IS. SOME OF OUR

02:24:49.280 --> 02:24:50.615
OPPORTUNITIES GOING FORWARD OR

02:24:50.681 --> 02:24:51.983
DO INVEST IN THE AREAS THAT ARE

02:24:52.050 --> 02:24:54.252
<i>OT URBAN CORES WHERE WE HAVE</i>

02:24:54.318 --> 02:24:56.287
THE CAPITAL WHERE WE HAVE THE

02:24:56.354 --> 02:24:58.022
DENSITY OF DEMAND. BUT IT'S TO

02:24:58.089 --> 02:24:59.924
REALLY BUILD UP OTHER PARTS OF

02:24:59.991 --> 02:25:03.261
CALIFORNIA'S BASE. TO BECOME

02:25:03.327 --> 02:25:04.796
LEADERS IN THESE OTHER AREAS SO

02:25:04.862 --> 02:25:06.864
FAR TO RUN THROUGH QUITE QUICKLY

02:25:06.931 --> 02:25:08.566
THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT I

02:25:08.633 --> 02:25:10.101
LISTED ON THE SECOND PAGE OF MY

02:25:10.168 --> 02:25:13.037
TESTIMONY. FIRST AND SEVERAL

02:25:13.104 --> 02:25:14.772
PEOPLE HAVE SAID VERSIONS OF IT.

02:25:14.839 --> 02:25:16.474
CALIFORNIA SHOULD BRING FORWARD

02:25:16.541 --> 02:25:19.110
TO THE TWENTY THIRTY FIVE DATE

02:25:19.177 --> 02:25:21.045
FOR THE END OF SALES OF NEW

02:25:21.112 --> 02:25:24.248
INTERNAL COMBUSTION VEHICLES TO

02:25:24.315 --> 02:25:25.950
TWENTY THIRTY OR EARLIER ALREADY

02:25:26.017 --> 02:25:27.118
THE UNITED KINGDOM AND

02:25:27.185 --> 02:25:30.555
MASSACHUSETTS IN WATCHING OUR

02:25:30.621 --> 02:25:31.689
ACTIONS HAVE MOVED TO THAT DATE

02:25:31.756 --> 02:25:33.758
. THAT EARLIER DATE IS NOT A JOB

02:25:33.825 --> 02:25:36.527
KILLER IT IS NOT AN ANTI RURAL A

02:25:36.594 --> 02:25:37.829
STATEMENT IT IS A STATEMENT OF

02:25:37.895 --> 02:25:39.564
INVESTING IN INNOVATION BECAUSE

02:25:39.630 --> 02:25:41.666
THE AREAS WHERE WE NEED. NEW

02:25:41.732 --> 02:25:44.702
VEHICLE TECHNOLOGIES- TRIED ARE

02:25:44.769 --> 02:25:46.137
IN THE AGRICULTURE SECTOR AS

02:25:46.204 --> 02:25:48.439
ASSEMBLY MEMBER- FLOOR

02:25:48.506 --> 02:25:49.440
HIGHLIGHTED THEIR FOR HEAVY

02:25:49.507 --> 02:25:52.710
INDUSTRY THERE TO WORK AT PORTS

02:25:52.777 --> 02:25:54.479
. THOSE ARE ALL OPPORTUNITIES TO

02:25:54.545 --> 02:25:56.314
INVEST IN ELECTRIC VEHICLES ANY

02:25:56.380 --> 02:25:58.349
NEAR TERM OPPORTUNITIES FOR

02:25:58.416 --> 02:26:00.384
HYDROGEN VEHICLES. VERY RECENTLY

02:26:00.451 --> 02:26:01.953
UNITED KINGDOM HAS DEVOTED ITS

02:26:02.019 --> 02:26:03.921
LARGEST AND TUSKER INDUSTRIAL

02:26:03.988 --> 02:26:06.524
CLUSTER. THE HUMBER CLUSTER TO

02:26:06.591 --> 02:26:08.526
BECOME AN ENTIRELY GREEN

02:26:08.593 --> 02:26:10.595
HYDROGEN FUNDED OPPORTUNITY AND

02:26:10.661 --> 02:26:13.131
MAKE IT GETS BACK TO THE BUT THE

02:26:13.197 --> 02:26:14.232
POINT MADE BY SOMEBODY MEMBER

02:26:14.298 --> 02:26:18.002
GARCIA. ABOUT THE NEED TO INVEST

02:26:18.069 --> 02:26:19.170
AND TO DEAL WITH THE SO CALLED

02:26:19.237 --> 02:26:21.772
DOCKER. IN FACT THE WORRISOME

02:26:21.839 --> 02:26:23.774
DOCKER. HAS BECOME AN

02:26:23.841 --> 02:26:25.977
OPPORTUNITY WHAT WE ONCE LOOKED

02:26:26.043 --> 02:26:28.546
AT FROM THE MODELING PERSPECTIVE

02:26:28.613 --> 02:26:31.415
AS A CHALLENGE OF FINDING VALUE

02:26:31.482 --> 02:26:33.050
FOR CLEAN ENERGY BECAUSE OF A

02:26:33.117 --> 02:26:35.019
SMALL THE LOW MARGINAL COST FOR

02:26:35.086 --> 02:26:36.954
CLEAN ENERGY DURING THE DAY. HAS

02:26:37.021 --> 02:26:38.456
BECOME AN OPPORTUNITY TO POWER

02:26:38.523 --> 02:26:42.593
VEHICLES AND TO MAKE HYDROGEN

02:26:42.660 --> 02:26:43.794
WHEN THE DEMAND FOR ELECTRICITY

02:26:43.861 --> 02:26:46.364
IS LOW. THAT LEADS TO ONE OF THE

02:26:46.430 --> 02:26:47.165
OF MY OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS AND

02:26:47.231 --> 02:26:48.432
THAT IS THIS COMMITTEE WORKING

02:26:48.499 --> 02:26:49.700
WITH THE PLANNING COMMITTEE IS

02:26:49.767 --> 02:26:52.336
WORKING WITH- WITH WITH THE U.

02:26:52.403 --> 02:26:55.940
S. NAVY. NEEDS TO ACCELERATE OUR

02:26:56.007 --> 02:26:56.941
DEPLOYMENT PLANS FOR OFFSHORE

02:26:57.008 --> 02:26:59.243
WIND. OFFSHORE WIND IS A HUGE

02:26:59.310 --> 02:27:01.512
RESOURCES FOR THE WESTERN UNITED

02:27:01.579 --> 02:27:03.514
STATES IN PARTICULAR CALIFORNIA.

02:27:03.581 --> 02:27:06.617
AND LAST WEEK'S AUCTIONS OF EAST

02:27:06.684 --> 02:27:10.821
COAST- BLOCKS FOR OFF SHORE WIND

02:27:10.888 --> 02:27:12.823
BROUGHT IN FIVE BILLION DOLLARS

02:27:12.890 --> 02:27:14.225
. THOSE ARE ESTIMATED TO PRODUCE

02:27:14.292 --> 02:27:16.160
IN THE LONG RUN EIGHTY THOUSAND

02:27:16.227 --> 02:27:17.461
NEW JOBS THAT'S ROUGHLY

02:27:17.528 --> 02:27:19.564
EQUIVALENT TO THE U. S. TO THE

02:27:19.630 --> 02:27:21.566
CALIFORNIA SOLAR INDUSTRY TODAY.

02:27:21.632 --> 02:27:23.134
AGGRESSIVELY MOVING HALL FORWARD

02:27:23.201 --> 02:27:25.069
ON PILOT PROJECTS IN OFFSHORE

02:27:25.136 --> 02:27:26.804
WIND WILL GENERATE CLEAN

02:27:26.871 --> 02:27:29.273
ELECTRICITY WHEN DEMAND IS HIGH

02:27:29.340 --> 02:27:30.975
AND CLEAN HYDROGEN WHEN DEMAND

02:27:31.042 --> 02:27:33.644
IS LOW. CALIFORNIA SHOULD ALSO

02:27:33.711 --> 02:27:35.846
WORK AGGRESSIVELY WITH THE U. S.

02:27:35.913 --> 02:27:37.114
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TO TRY TO

02:27:37.181 --> 02:27:40.218
OVERTURN- OR TO WORK AROUND THE

02:27:40.284 --> 02:27:42.053
HIGHLY UNFORTUNATE DECISION BY

SOCIAL COST OF CARBON. ONE OF

02:27:46.624 --> 02:27:48.025
THE WAYS THAT CALIFORNIA CAN BE

02:27:48.092 --> 02:27:50.528
A LEADER IN THIS AREA IS TO

02:27:50.595 --> 02:27:52.597
UTILIZE A SOCIAL COST OF CARBON

02:27:52.663 --> 02:27:54.699
THAT REFLECTS RACIAL SOCIAL

02:27:54.765 --> 02:27:56.801
GENDER JUSTICE INTO OUR OWN

02:27:56.867 --> 02:27:58.936
ANALYSIS. OVER AND OVER AGAIN

02:27:59.003 --> 02:27:59.904
THAT WILL HIGHLIGHT THE

02:27:59.971 --> 02:28:01.706
OPPORTUNITIES FOR CALIFORNIA

02:28:01.772 --> 02:28:04.075

PRESIDENT BIDEN'S JUSTICE FORTY

02:28:17.188 --> 02:28:19.924
TO INVEST 40% WILL WILL BRING TO

02:28:19.991 --> 02:28:22.493
INDUSTRY. IN CALIFORNIA HOUSING

02:28:22.560 --> 02:28:25.863
POLICY IS CLIMATE POLICY WE MAKE

02:28:25.930 --> 02:28:27.465
THE LOWEST INCOME PEOPLE DRIVE

02:28:27.531 --> 02:28:29.400
THE FURTHEST TO WORK IT IS

02:28:29.467 --> 02:28:31.535
RACIALLY SOCIALLY AND GENDER

02:28:31.602 --> 02:28:34.672
UNFAIR IT LIMITS OUR WORK FORCE

02:28:34.739 --> 02:28:36.941
AND IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY WHERE.

02:28:37.008 --> 02:28:39.443
INVESTING IN MIXED HOUSE MIXED

HOUSING AREAS IS A MOVEMENT

02:28:44.982 --> 02:28:46.384
TOWARDS JUSTICE BOTH FOR

02:28:46.450 --> 02:28:50.288
INDIVIDUALS AND FOR THE CLIMATE

02:28:50.354 --> 02:28:52.890
. A FINAL AREA IS THAT A KEY

02:28:52.957 --> 02:28:54.425
INTO OUR LOW CARBON FUEL

02:28:54.492 --> 02:28:57.094
STANDARD CALIFORNIA SHOULD NOT

02:28:57.161 --> 02:28:59.297
ONLY DO THE RESEARCH FOR WHICH

02:29:04.201 --> 02:29:06.270
IN IN THE PRIOR TESTIMONY. THAT

02:29:06.337 --> 02:29:08.039
WILL ENSURE THAT FOR BATTERY

YEP FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

02:31:19.270 --> 02:31:21.238
SO THE PROPOSED DRAFT RULING

02:31:21.305 --> 02:31:23.441
THAT WOULD HAVE TAXED SOLAR

02:31:23.507 --> 02:31:26.644
RETROACTIVELY AND WOULD HAVE

ELEMENTS THAT MAKE ECONOMIC

02:31:31.816 --> 02:31:34.351
SENSE WE RECOGNIZE THAT THE NET

02:31:34.418 --> 02:31:36.954
METERING WERE- REGULATIONS NEED

02:31:37.021 --> 02:31:39.423
TO BE UPDATED. BUT PUTTING A

02:31:39.490 --> 02:31:41.125
BRAKE ON SOLAR WHICH IS

02:31:41.192 --> 02:31:43.027
EFFECTIVELY WHAT THE P. YOU SEE

02:31:43.093 --> 02:31:44.829
RULING WOULD HAVE DONE. WOULD

02:31:44.895 --> 02:31:47.798
ESSENTIALLY BE AKIN TO KILLING

02:31:47.865 --> 02:31:49.200
THE GOLDEN GOOSE IN THE SENSE OF

02:31:49.266 --> 02:31:51.535
SOLAR HAS NOW BECOME FROM THE

02:31:51.602 --> 02:31:53.270
MOST EXPENSIVE TECHNOLOGY

02:31:53.337 --> 02:31:54.738
DECADES AGO TO THE LEAST

02:31:54.805 --> 02:31:57.107
EXPENSIVE TODAY. IT'S THE AREA

02:31:57.174 --> 02:31:59.510
WE WANT TO WE WANT TO REWARD THE

02:31:59.577 --> 02:32:01.445
MOST DISTRIBUTED GENERATION.

02:32:01.512 --> 02:32:03.647
FROM INDIVIDUAL HOMES TO PUBLIC

OPPORTUNITIES NOT ONLY DEPLOYED

02:32:13.390 --> 02:32:15.125
MORE SOLAR. BUT THEY- WITH

02:32:15.192 --> 02:32:16.193
TODAY'S ECONOMICS THEY

02:32:16.260 --> 02:32:18.629
FACILITATE THE INTERACTION OF

02:32:18.696 --> 02:32:20.397
ENERGY STORAGE AND IN FACT THE

02:32:20.464 --> 02:32:22.399
FASTEST GROWING COMBINATION OF

NEW ENERGY GENERATION IN

02:32:23.834 --> 02:32:26.070
CALIFORNIA. IS DEPLOYMENT OF

INTEGRATED SOLAR PLUS STORAGE

02:32:28.138 --> 02:32:30.307
TECHNOLOGIES. THAT'S AN

02:32:30.374 --> 02:32:32.009
OPPORTUNITY THAT WE DON'T WANT

02:32:32.076 --> 02:32:34.445
TO MISS OUT ON OR SEND SIGNALS

02:32:34.512 --> 02:32:36.413
TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR THAT WE

02:32:36.480 --> 02:32:40.384
ARE NOT THE MOST OPEN THE MOST.

02:32:40.451 --> 02:32:43.087
SOCIAL JUSTICE RACIALLY

02:32:43.153 --> 02:32:44.989
PROGRESSIVE PLACE TO INSTALL THE

02:32:45.055 --> 02:32:47.291
COUNTRY AND IN FACT LAST YEAR

02:32:47.358 --> 02:32:48.158
WAS THE FIRST YEAR THE

02:32:48.225 --> 02:32:51.195
CALIFORNIA. LET LOST THE TOP

02:32:51.262 --> 02:32:53.163
SPOT IN THE IN THE MOST AMOUNT

02:32:53.230 --> 02:32:56.000

02:32:56.066 --> 02:32:58.002
TEXAS IS NOW AHEAD OF US AFTER.

02:32:58.068 --> 02:32:59.303
FOR THE ENTIRE HISTORY OF SOLAR

02:32:59.370 --> 02:33:01.639
WE BEING IN THE FIRST PLACE. AND

02:33:01.705 --> 02:33:03.641
THAT THAT COST US JOBS AND THAT

02:33:03.707 --> 02:33:05.209
ALSO COST US COMPANIES THAT

02:33:05.276 --> 02:33:06.510
WOULD LOCATE HERE AND SO BY

02:33:06.577 --> 02:33:08.646
HIGHLIGHTING THE FACT THAT THE

02:33:08.712 --> 02:33:11.148
BATTLE WERE HAVING OVER THE P.

02:33:11.215 --> 02:33:13.984
YOU SEE- THAT THAT THE P. YOU

02:33:14.051 --> 02:33:15.386
SEE PROPOSED DECISION. IS ONE

02:33:15.452 --> 02:33:17.087
THAT IS SENT A NEGATIVE SIGNAL

02:33:17.154 --> 02:33:20.224
THE INDUSTRY ABOUT THE CLARITY

02:33:20.291 --> 02:33:21.959
THAT CALIFORNIA IS THE FIRST

02:33:22.026 --> 02:33:23.494
PLACE THEY SHOULD INVEST HAS

02:33:23.561 --> 02:33:25.663
HEARD US ON THE JOBS BASIS AND

02:33:25.729 --> 02:33:26.497
THAT'S REALLY THE BASIS FOR MY

02:33:26.564 --> 02:33:28.165
COMMENT THERE. THERE IS ONE

02:33:28.232 --> 02:33:30.868
ELEMENT OF THE POSE RULING THAT

02:33:30.935 --> 02:33:33.270
I STAND STRONGLY IN FAVOR OF AND

02:33:33.337 --> 02:33:36.874
THAT IS CARVING OUT A FUND. THAT

02:33:36.941 --> 02:33:38.242
WOULD BE MANAGED BY A PUBLIC.

02:33:38.309 --> 02:33:39.977
ASSEMBLY AND PRIVATE SECTOR

02:33:40.044 --> 02:33:42.880
GROUP TO INVEST IN ENERGY

02:33:42.947 --> 02:33:44.682
STORAGE FOR LOWER INCOME

02:33:44.748 --> 02:33:46.584
COMMUNITIES. SO THAT WE DON'T.

02:33:46.650 --> 02:33:48.085
LIKE MANY OTHER TECHNOLOGIES

02:33:48.152 --> 02:33:49.486
HAVE THEM THE LAST COMMUNITIES

02:33:49.553 --> 02:33:51.855
TO RECEIVE THE LATEST TECHNOLOGY

02:33:51.922 --> 02:33:53.290
THAT'S ONE OF THE KEY AREAS THAT

02:33:53.357 --> 02:33:54.959
I THINK NEEDS TO BE PRESERVED

02:33:55.025 --> 02:33:56.961
BUT WE NEED TO FIND A WAY. TO

02:33:57.027 --> 02:33:58.762
BRING THIS TOGETHER SO THAT. THE

02:33:58.829 --> 02:34:00.698
PC CAN MOVE FORWARD UTILITIES

02:34:00.764 --> 02:34:02.499
RECEIVE CREDIT FOR DISTRIBUTED

02:34:02.566 --> 02:34:04.034
SOLAR WHICH RIGHT NOW THEY

02:34:04.101 --> 02:34:06.203
ESSENTIALLY DO NOT RECEIVE- AND

02:34:06.270 --> 02:34:07.938
TO MOVE THAT INDUSTRY EVEN AT A

02:34:08.005 --> 02:34:09.707
HIGHER GEAR NOW THAT IT'S BECOME

02:34:09.773 --> 02:34:12.343
SO LOW COST. THAT THANKS FOR THE

02:34:12.409 --> 02:34:14.845
QUESTION. I'M NOT. I HAVE A

02:34:14.912 --> 02:34:16.246
FOLLOW UP FOR YOU IN TERMS OF

02:34:16.313 --> 02:34:18.716
HOW DO WE ADDRESS SOME OF THE

02:34:18.782 --> 02:34:20.451
MOST- SOME OF THE CONCERNS

02:34:20.517 --> 02:34:22.419
RELATED TO LOW INCOME FAMILIES

02:34:22.486 --> 02:34:24.355
AS WE MOVE FORWARD TO FULLY

02:34:24.421 --> 02:34:26.223
ATTAINING SOMETHING THAT WE ALL

02:34:26.290 --> 02:34:28.025
HOPE TO ACHIEVE WHICH IS 1100%

02:34:28.092 --> 02:34:32.262
RENEWABLE AND WE HAVE. A GOAL OF

02:34:32.329 --> 02:34:33.397
TWENTY FORTY FIVE AND OFTEN WANT

02:34:33.464 --> 02:34:35.299
TO MOVE FORWARD I REPRESENT A

02:34:35.366 --> 02:34:35.966
COMMUNITY THAT IS SURROUNDED BY

02:34:36.033 --> 02:34:39.870
FREEWAYS AND SO CLEAN AIR- YOU

02:34:39.937 --> 02:34:41.405
KNOW BEING ABLE TO REDUCE OUR

02:34:41.472 --> 02:34:43.474
ASK MARIE IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO

02:34:43.540 --> 02:34:44.708
OUR CMMUNITY AND RENEWABLE

02:34:44.775 --> 02:34:46.410
ENERGY IS CLEARLY THE DIRECTION

02:34:46.477 --> 02:34:49.847
THAT WE SHOULD GO I AM HOWEVER-

02:34:49.913 --> 02:34:51.482
GONNA PUT SOMETHING ON YOUR

02:34:51.548 --> 02:34:53.550
RADAR AND I AND I HOPE THAT YOU

02:34:53.617 --> 02:34:54.518
THOUGHT ABOUT THIS. AND THAT'S A

02:34:54.585 --> 02:34:56.854
MAY TWENTY TWENTY ONE REPORT BY

02:34:56.920 --> 02:34:59.289
THE P. YOU SEE BY AN INDEPENDENT

02:34:59.356 --> 02:35:00.090
AUDITOR THEN THE REPORT IS

02:35:00.157 --> 02:35:01.625
CALLED THE UTILITY COSTS AND

02:35:01.692 --> 02:35:03.293
AFFORDABILITY OF THE GRID OF THE

02:35:03.360 --> 02:35:05.362
FUTURE AND ON PAGE THIRTY IS

02:35:05.429 --> 02:35:07.398
SIMPLY STATES THE EVALUATION

02:35:07.464 --> 02:35:08.866
STUDY FOUND THAT AS COMPARED TO

02:35:08.932 --> 02:35:10.701
THE GENERAL CALIFORNIA

02:35:10.768 --> 02:35:11.802
POPULATION NAME CUSTOMERS ARE

02:35:11.869 --> 02:35:14.138
DISPROPORTIONATELY OLDER LOCATED

02:35:14.204 --> 02:35:16.040
IN HIGH INCOME AREAS LIKELY TO

02:35:16.106 --> 02:35:17.675
OWN THEIR OWN HOME AND LESS

02:35:17.741 --> 02:35:19.710
LIKELY TO LIVE IN A DIS AND LESS

02:35:19.777 --> 02:35:21.445
LIKELY TO LIVE IN A DISTANT. A

02:35:21.512 --> 02:35:22.413
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY

02:35:22.479 --> 02:35:24.048
CONSEQUENTLY THE COST OF NUMBER

02:35:24.114 --> 02:35:25.082
DISPROPORTIONATELY PAID BY

02:35:25.149 --> 02:35:27.251
YOUNGER LESS WEALTHY AND MORE

02:35:27.317 --> 02:35:28.819
DISADVANTAGED REPAIRS MANY OF

02:35:28.886 --> 02:35:31.588
WHOM ARE RENTERS AND SO TO

02:35:31.655 --> 02:35:33.524
ADDRESS ALL OF THESE CONCERNS

02:35:33.590 --> 02:35:35.659
THAT YOU SEE IS CONSIDERING A

02:35:35.726 --> 02:35:39.797
RESTRUCTURING OF NUMBER TO PUT-NO WHICH IS WHAT YOU ARE SAYING

02:35:39.863 --> 02:35:42.599
THIS HAS DENTED THE TRUST. OF

02:35:42.666 --> 02:35:44.368
THE SOLAR INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA

02:35:44.435 --> 02:35:46.036
WE ARE ALL CONCERNED WHAT WHAT

02:35:46.103 --> 02:35:47.538
THE FUTURE LOOKS LIKE I

02:35:47.604 --> 02:35:49.440
REPRESENT A DISTRICT THAT IS 20%

02:35:49.506 --> 02:35:51.041
BELOW THE NATIONAL POVERTY LINE

02:35:51.108 --> 02:35:53.043
WHY SHOULD LOW INCOME FAMILIES

02:35:53.110 --> 02:35:54.945
AND RENTERS PAY FOR THE

02:35:55.012 --> 02:35:56.847
DIFFERENCE WHAT IS THE SOLUTION

02:35:56.914 --> 02:35:58.382
THAT WE SHOULD BE CONSIDERING AN

02:35:58.449 --> 02:36:00.784
EFFORT TO ENSURE THAT SOLAR IS

02:36:00.851 --> 02:36:02.720
NOT JUST SOLELY FOR INDIVIDUALS

02:36:02.786 --> 02:36:04.788
THAT OWN THEIR HOMES BUT WHAT

02:36:04.855 --> 02:36:05.856
ARE THE INCENTIVES THAT WE

02:36:05.923 --> 02:36:07.291
SHOULD BE CONSIDERING US WE AND

02:36:07.357 --> 02:36:12.329
AS WE TRY TO. EXPAND THE GRID. I

02:36:12.396 --> 02:36:12.896
WE TRY TO REDUCE CONSUMPTION

02:36:12.963 --> 02:36:15.065
SOME FOSSIL FUELS. BUT THE COST

02:36:15.132 --> 02:36:16.967
SHOULD NEVER BE ON THE BURDEN OF

02:36:17.034 --> 02:36:18.168
LOW INCOME FAMILIES AND THE POOR

02:36:18.235 --> 02:36:20.537
AND RENTERS WHAT IS YOUR-

02:36:20.604 --> 02:36:21.839
RESPONSE IS THIS IS A GREAT

02:36:21.905 --> 02:36:23.040
QUESTION THANKS FOR THANKS FOR

02:36:23.107 --> 02:36:25.342
RAISING IT SO- THAT SECTION YOU

02:36:25.409 --> 02:36:26.877
REFER TO WAS PARTIALLY BASED ON

02:36:26.944 --> 02:36:28.512
A STUDY THAT MY LABORATORY DID

02:36:28.579 --> 02:36:30.380
WITH GOOGLE. WHERE WE LOOKED AT

02:36:30.447 --> 02:36:33.417
WHO HAD SOLAR ACROSS THE COUNTRY

02:36:33.484 --> 02:36:34.885
. AND CALIFORNIA AND WHAT WE

02:36:34.952 --> 02:36:37.087
FOUND IS THAT ACROSS AN ORDER OF

02:36:37.154 --> 02:36:37.654
MAGNITUDE OF INCOME FROM

02:36:37.721 --> 02:36:39.523
FAMILIES JUST BELOW THE POVERTY

02:36:39.590 --> 02:36:41.058
LINE TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND

02:36:41.125 --> 02:36:42.092
DOLLARS A YEAR FOR A FAMILY OF

02:36:42.159 --> 02:36:44.194
FOUR WHICH OF COURSE IS NOT

02:36:44.261 --> 02:36:45.095
AFFORDABLE IN CALIFORNIA. TO A

02:36:45.162 --> 02:36:46.630
QUARTER MILLION. WHAT THE WHOLE

02:36:46.697 --> 02:36:48.732
RANGE. WHITE MAJORITY

02:36:48.799 --> 02:36:50.801
NEIGHBORHOODS WERE 50% MORE

02:36:50.868 --> 02:36:52.970
LIKELY TO HAVE SOLAR. LET NECKS

02:36:53.036 --> 02:36:53.837
IN AFRICAN AMERICAN

02:36:53.904 --> 02:36:57.141
NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE 5275% LESS

02:36:57.207 --> 02:36:58.909
LIKELY TO HAVE SOLAR. FROM THE

02:36:58.976 --> 02:37:00.477
LOWEST INCOME TO THE HIGHEST

02:37:00.544 --> 02:37:02.045
INCOME AND I'D BE HAPPY TO SEND

02:37:02.112 --> 02:37:04.681
THAT REPORT AFTERWARDS IF YOU IF

02:37:04.748 --> 02:37:06.483
YOU LIKED IT IF ELECTED. TO TAKE

02:37:06.550 --> 02:37:07.918
A LOOK AT IT. WHAT WE FOUND

02:37:07.985 --> 02:37:09.653
UNFORTUNATELY WAS THAT MANY OF

02:37:09.720 --> 02:37:11.021
THE POLICIES THAT WERE USED TO.

02:37:11.088 --> 02:37:13.924
DEPLOY SOLAR. INVESTING IN SOME

02:37:13.991 --> 02:37:15.359
SMALL COMPANIES INVESTING IN

02:37:15.425 --> 02:37:17.161
SOME REAL ESTATE COMPANIES.

02:37:17.227 --> 02:37:20.297
FOLLOWED THE OLD MODEL. OF

02:37:20.364 --> 02:37:22.466
INVESTING IN. IN A LARGELY

02:37:22.533 --> 02:37:24.935
CAUCASIAN DOMINATED COMPANIES.

02:37:25.002 --> 02:37:28.005
AND THEY'VE DEPLOYED PRIMARILY A

02:37:28.071 --> 02:37:30.007
AND LIKE COMMUNITIES. AND SO

02:37:30.073 --> 02:37:32.009
FROM HOUSING COMPANIES TO SMALL

02:37:32.075 --> 02:37:34.578
SCALE SOLAR WE REPEATED. THE

02:37:34.645 --> 02:37:36.346
FAILED MODEL OF THE PAST WE ALSO

02:37:36.413 --> 02:37:39.149
KNOW. THAT FICUS SCORES ARE USED

02:37:39.216 --> 02:37:41.318
IN PRETORIA WAYS AGAINST

02:37:41.385 --> 02:37:42.619
MINORITY COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE

02:37:42.686 --> 02:37:44.922
COUNTRY AND IN CALIFORNIA. AND

02:37:44.988 --> 02:37:46.356
EVEN SOME POLICY IS ONE THAT I

02:37:46.423 --> 02:37:47.624
HELPED DESIGN CALLED PACE

02:37:47.691 --> 02:37:49.793
FINANCING. FROM A LATE LARGE

02:37:49.860 --> 02:37:51.195
STUDY LOS ANGELES WE FOUND IT

02:37:51.261 --> 02:37:53.463
WAS USED AS A PREDATORY TOOL

02:37:53.530 --> 02:37:55.799
AGAINST A LOW INCOME. MINORITY

02:37:55.866 --> 02:37:57.935
AN OLDER HOME OWNERS. SO THAT'S

02:37:58.001 --> 02:38:01.004
A HORRIBLE LEGACY OF NOT MOVING

02:38:01.071 --> 02:38:02.606
TO THE BENEFITS AND SO. I WOULD

02:38:02.673 --> 02:38:03.273
SAY THERE ARE SEVERAL

02:38:03.340 --> 02:38:04.808
OPPORTUNITIES TO ADDRESS WHAT

02:38:04.875 --> 02:38:07.144
YOU SAID ONE IS. THE CALIFORNIA

02:38:07.211 --> 02:38:09.179
DOES HAVE OUR CAP AND TRADE

02:38:09.246 --> 02:38:10.581
FUNDS WHICH WILL NOT FUND ALL OF

02:38:10.647 --> 02:38:12.416
THIS. BUT THERE ARE GREAT FIRST

02:38:12.482 --> 02:38:15.752
LEVER. CALIFORNIA DEVOTES 35% OR

02:38:15.819 --> 02:38:17.988
MORE OF THOSE FUNDS TO MINORITY

02:38:18.055 --> 02:38:20.123
FENCE LINE. MOST EXPOSED

02:38:20.190 --> 02:38:21.859
COMMUNITIES BUT THAT'S A FLOOR

02:38:21.925 --> 02:38:24.294
NOT A CEILING- CENTER WHEN HE

02:38:24.361 --> 02:38:25.863
WAS SENATOR- CENTER PART TIME-

02:38:25.929 --> 02:38:27.865
KEVIN DE LEÓN HIGHLIGHTED THAT

02:38:27.931 --> 02:38:30.067
THAT FLOOR WAS DESIGNED TO RISE.

02:38:30.133 --> 02:38:32.336
THE FEDERAL NUMBER. BUT BASED ON

02:38:32.402 --> 02:38:34.538
OUR TOTAL IS 40% OF FEDERAL

02:38:34.605 --> 02:38:36.773
SPENDING CALIFORNIA COULD UP THE

02:38:36.840 --> 02:38:37.975
FRACTION OF MONEY FROM THE CAP

02:38:38.041 --> 02:38:39.977
AND TRADE. THAT IS DEVOTED TO

02:38:40.043 --> 02:38:41.778
THESE FIRST PROJECTS IN LOW

02:38:41.845 --> 02:38:42.846
INCOME AREAS LIKE IN YOUR

02:38:42.913 --> 02:38:47.084
DISTRICT. AND ONE OF THE REAL

02:38:47.150 --> 02:38:48.018
OPPORTUNITIES. IS TO A SO THE

02:38:48.085 --> 02:38:49.753
SOAK SOLARGARDEN LAWS SO THAT

02:38:49.820 --> 02:38:51.421
YOU NEED NOT BE A PROPERTY OWNER

02:38:51.488 --> 02:38:53.523
TO TAKE ADVANTAGE. LOCAL STORES

02:38:53.590 --> 02:38:55.259
SUCH AS GROCERY STORES HAVE

02:38:55.325 --> 02:38:57.294
OFFRED SEVERAL TIMES TO HOST

02:38:57.361 --> 02:39:00.564
SOLAR. AND THAT COULD BE USED TO

02:39:00.631 --> 02:39:02.532
OFFSET UTILITY BILLS WHERE THAT

02:39:02.599 --> 02:39:04.001
THE ARRANGEMENT WOULD BE A

02:39:04.067 --> 02:39:05.702
PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN LAND OF

02:39:05.769 --> 02:39:07.938
PROPERTY OWNERS AND THE RENTERS

02:39:08.005 --> 02:39:09.806
TO SPLIT THE BENEFITS OF SOLAR

02:39:09.873 --> 02:39:11.742
RISING IN USING THESE OFF SITE

02:39:11.808 --> 02:39:14.611
LOCATIONS TO DO SO. THAT'S ONE

02:39:14.678 --> 02:39:15.212
OF THE TOOLS THAT THERE'S AN

02:39:15.279 --> 02:39:17.247
OPPORTUNITY HERE. THE SECOND ONE

02:39:17.314 --> 02:39:18.849
IS TO LOOK AT THE MODEL THAT

02:39:18.916 --> 02:39:21.084
LIFT HAS PILOTED BUT HASN'T

02:39:21.151 --> 02:39:23.453
MOVED AGGRESSIVELY ENOUGH YET ON

02:39:23.520 --> 02:39:25.022
AND THAT IS TO MAKE ELECTRIC

02:39:25.088 --> 02:39:27.858
VEHICLES. AVAILABLE FOR PURCHASE

02:39:27.925 --> 02:39:30.727
OR FOR LEASE AT OR BELOW COST

02:39:30.794 --> 02:39:32.095
THAT'S A NATURAL AREA FOR

02:39:32.162 --> 02:39:34.197
CALIFORNIA TO SUBSIDIZE ELECTRIC

02:39:34.264 --> 02:39:36.700
VEHICLES TO BE EXCESS EXCESS BY

02:39:36.767 --> 02:39:37.768
LOW INCOME MEMBERS OF THE

02:39:37.834 --> 02:39:40.003
COMMUNITY BECAUSE TYING ELECTRIC

02:39:40.070 --> 02:39:42.239
VEHICLES TO LOCAL GREEN

02:39:42.306 --> 02:39:44.708
GENERATION IS ALSO WAY. TO DROP

02:39:44.775 --> 02:39:46.343
THE LARGEST PART OF MOST

02:39:46.410 --> 02:39:46.944
PEOPLE'S BILLS WHICH IS

02:39:47.010 --> 02:39:49.012
TRANSPORTATION. SO I THINK THAT

02:39:49.079 --> 02:39:51.281
THE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE SAID

02:39:51.348 --> 02:39:53.016
OF OPPORTUNITIES IS IN FACT

02:39:53.083 --> 02:39:55.519
ARGUABLY OUR MOST EXCITING SET

02:39:55.585 --> 02:39:56.420
BECAUSE THAT'S THE ONE WE'VE

02:39:56.486 --> 02:39:58.155
SADLY DONE THE LEAST ON SO I

02:39:58.221 --> 02:40:00.123
THINK THIS IS AN AREA WHERE CAN

02:40:00.190 --> 02:40:02.626
A MENU OF. OF JUST TRANSITION

02:40:02.693 --> 02:40:04.261
OPPORTUNITIES WOULD MOST

02:40:04.328 --> 02:40:05.495
ACCELERATE THE CALIFORNIA'S

02:40:05.562 --> 02:40:07.331
MOVEMENT BUT WOULD ALSO PUT THE

02:40:07.397 --> 02:40:09.199
BENEFITS INTO THE LEAST OF THAT

02:40:09.266 --> 02:40:11.835
HISTORICALLY DISCRIMINATED

02:40:11.902 --> 02:40:14.404
AGAINST PARTS OF THE STATE. HI

02:40:14.471 --> 02:40:16.173
MY NAME IS RICHARD THANK YOU FOR

02:40:16.239 --> 02:40:17.674
THE INDULGENCE. THE ELECTRIC

02:40:17.741 --> 02:40:18.942
VEHICLE CONVERSATION IS

02:40:19.009 --> 02:40:20.310
INTERESTING IN AREAS WHERE YOU

02:40:20.377 --> 02:40:22.245
ARE NOT A HOMEOWNER YOU DON'T

02:40:22.312 --> 02:40:23.547
HAVE ACCESS TO A GARAGE WHEN YOU

02:40:23.613 --> 02:40:25.282
DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO ACTUALLY

02:40:25.349 --> 02:40:26.183
CREATE. THE PLUGIN FOR YOUR

02:40:26.249 --> 02:40:29.720
VEHICLE SO IF WE ARE LOOKING AT-

02:40:29.786 --> 02:40:32.289
RESIDENCY APARTMENTS. WHAT IS

02:40:32.356 --> 02:40:34.124
THE WHAT IS THE INCENTIVE FOR

02:40:34.191 --> 02:40:35.659
THE OWNER OF AN APARTMENT

02:40:35.726 --> 02:40:39.563
COMPLEX TO BE ABLE TO PUT IN.

02:40:39.629 --> 02:40:40.797
SOLAR FOR THE RENTERS- IN THAT

02:40:40.864 --> 02:40:42.265
BUILDING YEAH I THINK THERE'S

02:40:42.332 --> 02:40:43.133
TWO ASPECTS AND THEY'RE THEY'RE

02:40:43.200 --> 02:40:45.302
TIED TOGETHER. THE FIRST IS THAT

02:40:45.369 --> 02:40:46.737
AGAIN THESE BILLS THAT UPS THAT

02:40:46.803 --> 02:40:48.405
HAVE BEEN WORKED ON THE SO

02:40:48.472 --> 02:40:50.040
CALLED SOLAR GARDENS BILLS ARE

02:40:50.107 --> 02:40:51.641
DESIGNED TO SPLIT THE INCENTIVE

02:40:51.708 --> 02:40:52.843
THAT THE HOME OF THAT THE

02:40:52.909 --> 02:40:53.977
PROPERTY OWNER GETS AN INCENTIVE

02:40:54.044 --> 02:40:56.913
AS LONG AS- THE SAVINGS. BY

02:40:56.980 --> 02:40:59.983
GOING TO ELECTRICITY ARE. PASSED

02:41:00.050 --> 02:41:01.918
ON TO RENTERS IN THERE BILLS

02:41:01.985 --> 02:41:03.987
THAT HAS. ISSUES THAT YOU CAN'T

02:41:04.054 --> 02:41:06.023
DO IT ALL AT THE STATE LEVEL

02:41:06.089 --> 02:41:07.124
THERE'S ALSO LOCAL JURISDICTIONS

02:41:07.190 --> 02:41:09.192
JURISDICTION ASPECTS. BUT IT'S

02:41:09.259 --> 02:41:10.827
ONE OF THE OPPORTUNITIES. THE

02:41:10.894 --> 02:41:12.262
OTHER PART IS WHAT YOU

02:41:12.329 --> 02:41:13.096
HIGHLIGHTED IN TERMS OF THE

02:41:13.163 --> 02:41:15.298
EEVEE PART OF THAT STORY. I

02:41:15.365 --> 02:41:16.800
CURRENTLY RUN A PROJECT FUNDED

02:41:16.867 --> 02:41:17.667
BY THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY

02:41:17.734 --> 02:41:19.636
COMMISSION. CALLED THE ECO BLOCK

02:41:19.703 --> 02:41:22.606
AND IT TAKES A LOW INCOME FORTY

02:41:22.672 --> 02:41:25.475
HOME AND APARTMENT BLOCK IN

02:41:25.542 --> 02:41:28.045
OAKLAND. ELECTRIFY IS BY PUTTING

02:41:28.111 --> 02:41:29.346
SOLAR ON THE ROOF BUT IT'S A

02:41:29.413 --> 02:41:31.114
SHARED RESOURCES SO IT DOES NOT

02:41:31.181 --> 02:41:32.749
POWER THE HOMES DIRECTLY. IT

02:41:32.816 --> 02:41:34.017
GOES INTO A SHARED ENERGY

02:41:34.084 --> 02:41:36.486
STORAGE FACILITY THAT POWERS THE

02:41:36.553 --> 02:41:39.256
HOMES. POWERS PUBLICLY AVAILABLE

02:41:39.322 --> 02:41:41.224
EASY CHARGING IN THE REGULAR

STREET SIDE PARKING AREAS AND

02:41:43.527 --> 02:41:45.695
THEN THE EXTRA POWER BEYOND THAT

02:41:45.762 --> 02:41:47.464
IS THEN SOLD BACK TO P. JEANNIE.

02:41:47.531 --> 02:41:49.599
THE EAGLE BLOCK IS AN EXAMPLE OF

02:41:49.666 --> 02:41:52.202
A MIXED USE WHERE THERE ARE SOME

02:41:52.269 --> 02:41:53.770
PROPERTY OWNERS ON THE BLOCK

02:41:53.837 --> 02:41:55.972
IT'S IN THE FRUITVALE SECTION OF

02:41:56.039 --> 02:41:59.543
OAKLAND. AND THERE ARE PERMANENT

02:41:59.609 --> 02:42:00.177
BUILDINGS ON THE BLOCK AS WELL.

02:42:00.243 --> 02:42:01.511

VEHICLES JUST RECENTLY ANNOUNCED

02:42:26.036 --> 02:42:27.637
IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO

02:42:27.704 --> 02:42:28.705
DISPROPORTIONATELY PUT THAT

02:42:28.772 --> 02:42:30.707
MONEY BOTH TO MAKING EVEY

02:42:30.774 --> 02:42:32.742

PURCHASE OR LEASE OF ELECTRIC

02:42:37.747 --> 02:42:38.782
VEHICLES FOR LOW INCOME

02:42:38.849 --> 02:42:41.585
CALIFORNIANS NOT MORE AFFLUENT

02:42:41.651 --> 02:42:46.323
CALIFORNIANS. THANK YOU MISTER

02:42:46.389 --> 02:42:49.860
CHAIR- THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL

02:42:49.926 --> 02:42:53.029
IS INTERESTING ESPECIALLY IN THE

02:42:53.096 --> 02:42:54.564
RECOGNITION THAT LOW INCOME

02:42:54.631 --> 02:42:56.666
FAMILIES ARE LOW INCOME AREAS IN

02:42:56.733 --> 02:42:59.402
GENERAL DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO

02:42:59.469 --> 02:43:01.037
WHAT WE ARE CONSIDERING WILL BE

02:43:01.104 --> 02:43:02.439
THE VERY NEAR FUTURE OF

02:43:02.506 --> 02:43:05.876
CALIFORNIA RIGHT MY DAD DRIVES A

02:43:05.942 --> 02:43:07.644
OLD NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE TOYOTA

02:43:07.711 --> 02:43:09.212
PICKUP. AND SO I THINK ABOUT

02:43:09.279 --> 02:43:10.113
COMMUNITIES LIKE MINE I THINK

02:43:10.180 --> 02:43:11.781
ABOUT MY DAD WOULD DRIVE THIS

02:43:11.848 --> 02:43:14.384
TRUCK HOW IS HE GOING TO ONE BE

02:43:14.451 --> 02:43:16.186
ABLE TO AFFORD IN YOUR VEHICLE

02:43:16.253 --> 02:43:17.954
TO WHERE IS HE GOING TO PLUG IT

02:43:18.021 --> 02:43:19.656
IN AND MANY FAMILIES LIKE THAT

02:43:19.723 --> 02:43:21.091
SO I'M CURIOUS IF THERE'S A WAY

02:43:21.158 --> 02:43:23.460
THAT WE CAN LOOK AT THAT

02:43:23.527 --> 02:43:24.094
POTENTIAL BUDGET PROPOSAL. AND

02:43:24.161 --> 02:43:27.097
THINK OF IT- THREE CENSUS TRACTS

02:43:27.164 --> 02:43:29.132
THE CENSUS CAN GIVE US AN

02:43:29.199 --> 02:43:30.734
OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK AT WHERE ARE

02:43:30.800 --> 02:43:32.502
THE AREAS THAT HAVE THE MOST

02:43:32.569 --> 02:43:33.970
NEED WHERE THE AREAS AND WE

02:43:34.037 --> 02:43:35.839
SHOULD POTENTIALLY FOCUS ON AND

02:43:35.906 --> 02:43:39.142
HOW CAN WE CREATE EQUITY AND

02:43:39.209 --> 02:43:41.211
THIS NEW CONVERSATION ABOUT

02:43:41.278 --> 02:43:43.480
RENEWABLE ENERGY WHICH IS. I

02:43:43.547 --> 02:43:44.781
THINK THE MOST IMPORTANT AND

02:43:44.848 --> 02:43:47.918
MISSING PIECE IN THIS ENTIRE

02:43:47.984 --> 02:43:50.487
PROCESS. THANK YOU FOR BRINGING

02:43:50.554 --> 02:43:52.689
THAT UP AND SO I'M GONNA GO BIT

02:43:52.756 --> 02:43:54.057
OFF SCRIPT HERE- I HAVE A

02:43:54.124 --> 02:43:56.193
FAVORITE POLICY BUT AGAIN IT'S

02:43:56.259 --> 02:43:57.894
ONE FOR THE COMMITTEE TO LOOK AT

02:43:57.961 --> 02:43:59.563
AND IT'S A FEE BASED POLICY. AND

02:43:59.629 --> 02:44:01.431
THAT IS AS WE LOOK AT VEHICLES

02:44:01.498 --> 02:44:03.233
AS A FUNCTION OF COST OR AS A

02:44:03.300 --> 02:44:06.036
FUNCTION OF CARBON EMISSIONS. WE

02:44:06.102 --> 02:44:08.238
ATTACH A FEE TO THOSE THAT WE

02:44:08.305 --> 02:44:10.440
WANT TO DISCOURAGE AND WE

02:44:10.507 --> 02:44:12.275
TRANSFER THAT TO THE PURCHASE BY

02:44:12.342 --> 02:44:13.810
PEOPLE FOR IN AREAS WE WANT TO

02:44:13.877 --> 02:44:15.946
ENCOURAGE. AND THAT CAN BE

02:44:16.012 --> 02:44:17.480
SIMPLY A POLICY WHERE YOU HAVE

02:44:17.547 --> 02:44:19.549
KIND OF A SYMMETRIC WE TAX ON

02:44:19.616 --> 02:44:21.318
ONE SIDE WE GIVE THE OTHER SIDE.

02:44:21.384 --> 02:44:23.486
BUT THERE'S NO REASON WHY THAT

02:44:23.553 --> 02:44:25.155
CAN'T BE BASED ON INCOME. SO THE

02:44:25.222 --> 02:44:26.957
IDEA THAT WE COULD CRAFT A FEE

02:44:27.023 --> 02:44:29.426
BAIT. TO ENCOURAGE ELECTRIC

02:44:29.492 --> 02:44:32.028
VEHICLES. BUT TARGETED. YOU TOO

02:44:32.095 --> 02:44:33.930
LOW INCOME MEMBERS OF OUR COVER

02:44:33.997 --> 02:44:36.433
COMMUNITY. TO MY OWN ST UP MY

02:44:36.499 --> 02:44:37.901
OWN OPINION MAKES A GREAT DEAL

02:44:37.968 --> 02:44:39.336
OF SENSE AND IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY

02:44:39.402 --> 02:44:40.437
THAT'S BEEN DISCUSSED IN THE

02:44:40.503 --> 02:44:43.039
PAST. WE DID NOT ACT ON IT- I

02:44:43.106 --> 02:44:45.175
THINK IT'S ONE OF THE TOOLS THAT

02:44:45.242 --> 02:44:46.409
ARE AVAILABLE TO US RIGHT NOW

02:44:46.476 --> 02:44:47.310
BECAUSE WHERE IT'S BEEN TRIED

02:44:47.377 --> 02:44:49.446
SUGGESTED IRELAND AND FRANCE AND

02:44:49.512 --> 02:44:50.247
FRANCE IN THE BONUS MALUS

02:44:50.313 --> 02:44:51.881
SYSTEM. IT'S BEEN VERY

02:44:51.948 --> 02:44:54.284
EFFECTIVE. HOW MANY YOU CAN

02:44:54.351 --> 02:44:55.151
TARGET AGAIN WITH THE ONE YOU

02:44:55.218 --> 02:44:57.087
SENSE THIS TRACTOR AREAS ARE

02:44:57.153 --> 02:44:58.788
PURELY INCOME. THOSE ARE ALL

02:44:58.855 --> 02:45:00.624
OPPORTUNITIES THAT ARE THERE ARE

02:45:00.690 --> 02:45:03.727
NOT PROHIBITED. AND THANKFULLY

02:45:03.793 --> 02:45:04.995
THE CAP AND TRADE MONEY. IS

02:45:05.061 --> 02:45:07.797
FAIRLY UNRESTRICTED IN THIS AREA

02:45:07.864 --> 02:45:09.966
BECAUSE OF THE REQUIREMENT FOR A

02:45:10.033 --> 02:45:11.868
BI MENTAL JUSTICE SO THERE IS AN

02:45:11.935 --> 02:45:13.703
OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD A POLICY

02:45:13.770 --> 02:45:14.371
HERE. I SUSPECT EVERYONE AROUND

02:45:14.437 --> 02:45:15.939
THE ROOM NOT EVERYONE WOULD BE

02:45:16.006 --> 02:45:18.141
AS EXCITED ABOUT- THE FE BATES

02:45:18.208 --> 02:45:20.043
AS I AM BUT IT'S ONE OF THE WAYS

02:45:20.110 --> 02:45:23.713
THAT WE CAN MOVE THE MONEY MOST

02:45:23.780 --> 02:45:24.314
DIRECTLY. AND THAT OF COURSE

02:45:24.381 --> 02:45:25.081
FEEDBACK. BECAUSE THE MORE WE

02:45:25.148 --> 02:45:26.716
PUSH FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLES THE

02:45:26.783 --> 02:45:28.351
MORE IT MAKES OUR CLEAN ENERGY

02:45:28.418 --> 02:45:30.020
STANDARDS EFFECTIVE AND SO WE

02:45:30.086 --> 02:45:31.655
GET AIR QUALITY BENEFITS. WE GET

02:45:31.721 --> 02:45:34.224
JOBS BENEFITS WE ALSO PUSH MORE

02:45:34.291 --> 02:45:35.558
FOR THE MANUFACTURING OF

02:45:35.625 --> 02:45:37.527
VEHICLES. THE MEDIA MORE DIVERSE

02:45:37.594 --> 02:45:39.429
RANGE OF NEEDS NOT JUST KIND OF.

02:45:39.496 --> 02:45:42.065
TESLA'S IN AFFLUENT

02:45:42.132 --> 02:45:42.599
NEIGHBORHOODS BUT WORKING

02:45:42.666 --> 02:45:49.239
VEHICLES. THANK YOU- ANY OTHER

02:45:49.306 --> 02:45:51.708
QUESTIONS FOR YES CENTER BACK UP

02:45:51.775 --> 02:45:53.576
I'LL JUST KEEP IT. THANK YOU SO

02:45:53.643 --> 02:45:54.811
MUCH I. AGREE WITH WHAT YOU

02:45:54.878 --> 02:45:57.781
SAID- I'M TO ASK ABOUT THE SAME

02:45:57.847 --> 02:46:00.283
A MATERIALS CODE AND- WE CAN

02:46:00.350 --> 02:46:02.152
TAKE IT OFF OR DO SOMETHING TO

02:46:02.218 --> 02:46:03.920
IT. YOU CAN SHARE WITH US ON

02:46:03.987 --> 02:46:04.954
THAT IDEA BECAUSE NOT WHEN I HAD

02:46:05.021 --> 02:46:06.790
BEEN FAMILIAR WITH. YES ONE

02:46:06.856 --> 02:46:08.058
THAT'S ACTUALLY STILL UNDER

02:46:08.124 --> 02:46:09.125
UNDER DISCUSSION IN A VARIETY OF

02:46:09.192 --> 02:46:10.327
AREAS MASSACHUSETTS IS LOOKING

02:46:10.393 --> 02:46:11.895
AT IT- GERMANY AND FRANCE ARE

02:46:11.961 --> 02:46:13.229
BOTH LOOKING AT IT. BUT THE IDEA

02:46:13.296 --> 02:46:15.031
WOULD BE TO BUILD SOMETHING VERY

02:46:15.098 --> 02:46:17.067
SIMILAR TO WHAT WE HAVE IN THE

02:46:17.133 --> 02:46:18.668
LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD. AND

02:46:18.735 --> 02:46:21.771
THAT IS A GRAMS OF CO TWO

02:46:21.838 --> 02:46:24.140
EMISSION PER MATERIAL IN THE

02:46:24.207 --> 02:46:26.476
END. AND SO IF WE LOOK AT SOME

02:46:26.543 --> 02:46:28.445
OF THE MOST DAMAGING ASPECTS OF

02:46:28.511 --> 02:46:31.381
MINING FOR LITHIUM FOR COBALT.

02:46:31.448 --> 02:46:33.049
AN ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE AND A

02:46:33.116 --> 02:46:35.151
CARBON STANDARD. IS SOME OF THE

02:46:35.218 --> 02:46:37.220
VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT WE'VE

02:46:37.287 --> 02:46:37.987
ALREADY WORKED THROUGH IN THE

02:46:38.054 --> 02:46:39.489
STATE WITH THE L. CFS. THT

02:46:39.556 --> 02:46:42.492
WOULD ALLOW US TO FIRST SOURCE

02:46:42.559 --> 02:46:44.494
THE MORE SUSTAINABLE MATERIALS.

02:46:44.561 --> 02:46:46.663
BUT THEN ALSO TO PUSH THE MINING

02:46:46.730 --> 02:46:49.099
INDUSTRY AND THE LARGE OEMS THE

02:46:49.165 --> 02:46:50.934
AUTO MANUFACTURERS. TO ALSO

02:46:51.000 --> 02:46:53.570
SOURCE THOSE MORE SUSTAINABLE

02:46:53.636 --> 02:46:55.171
MATERIALS. AND THAT'S AN

02:46:55.238 --> 02:46:56.840
OPPORTUNITY THAT BOTH FITS INTO

02:46:56.906 --> 02:46:58.007
OUR CODE IT FITS INTO THE

02:46:58.074 --> 02:46:59.776
RECYCLING LAWS WE ALREADY USE

02:46:59.843 --> 02:47:02.345
WHERE- LOOK OF CELL PHONES AND

02:47:02.412 --> 02:47:04.481
LAPTOPS PURCHASED IN CALIFORNIA

02:47:04.547 --> 02:47:06.182
HAVE A RECYCLING FEE BUILT IN.

02:47:06.249 --> 02:47:07.650
BUT WE COULD NOW DO THIS AROUND

02:47:07.717 --> 02:47:10.153
CARBON. AND SOCIAL JUSTICE AND

02:47:10.220 --> 02:47:12.522
WE KNOW THAT MANY OF THE

02:47:12.589 --> 02:47:13.189
MATERIALS IN THE DEVICES WE USE

02:47:13.256 --> 02:47:15.392
ALL THE TIME. COME FROM CONFLICT

02:47:15.458 --> 02:47:17.160
AREAS IN THE CONGO AND ELSEWHERE

02:47:17.227 --> 02:47:19.763
WHERE I WORK- BUT SOME.

02:47:19.829 --> 02:47:23.900
STANDARDS. THAT REQUIRE THESE TO

02:47:23.967 --> 02:47:25.001
BE. BETTER ON THE CLIMB HUMAN

02:47:25.068 --> 02:47:27.470
BASIS WOULD BE SOME THAT WOULD

02:47:27.537 --> 02:47:28.204
FIT WELL INTO CALIFORNIA'S-

02:47:28.271 --> 02:47:29.706
OVERALL PLAN SO THAT'S THAT'S

02:47:29.773 --> 02:47:31.841
THE THAT'S THE- START I WOULD.

02:47:31.908 --> 02:47:36.112
RECOMMEND ON THAT. THANK YOU.

02:47:36.179 --> 02:47:39.849
THE QUESTIONS. OKAY QUICK

02:47:39.916 --> 02:47:42.385
QUESTION IF YOU STILL ARE YOU

02:47:42.452 --> 02:47:43.253
OKAY WITH YEAH I KNOW COULD

02:47:43.319 --> 02:47:48.158
HURT- SO I MEAN I YOUR YOUR FEE

02:47:48.224 --> 02:47:51.628
BAIT IDEA I ACTUALLY I. WAS

02:47:51.694 --> 02:47:53.530
WORKING ON A CARBON FEE AND

02:47:53.596 --> 02:47:57.734
DIVIDEND- A PER PROPOSAL BUT-

02:47:57.801 --> 02:47:59.969
YOU KNOW BE A GIVEN THE- THE

02:48:00.036 --> 02:48:02.071
WARRANT IN UKRAINE AND IN THE

02:48:02.138 --> 02:48:05.074
SKYROCKETING GAS PRICES MEAN.

02:48:05.141 --> 02:48:06.543
DID YOU KNOW THAT AND SO THAT

02:48:06.609 --> 02:48:08.011
SEEMS TO BE THAT YOU KNOW OF

02:48:08.077 --> 02:48:10.447
THIS THEME THAT THAT I'M HEARING

02:48:10.513 --> 02:48:11.247
ON THIS CARDIO AND OTHERS HAVE

02:48:11.314 --> 02:48:13.917
RAISED I MEAN. WE HAVE THESE YOU

02:48:13.983 --> 02:48:15.819
KNOW THESE ASPIRATIONS TO TAKE

02:48:15.885 --> 02:48:17.754
BOLD ACTION TO ADVANCE CLIMATE

02:48:17.821 --> 02:48:20.323
AGENDA AND YET. YOU KNOW WE'RE

02:48:20.390 --> 02:48:23.026
WE'RE DEALING WITH THE REALITIES

02:48:23.092 --> 02:48:27.430
OF PEOPLE THAT. YOU KNOW- STILL

02:48:27.497 --> 02:48:28.731
DRIVING THEIR NINETEEN EIGHTY

02:48:28.798 --> 02:48:30.467
NINE TRUCK OR OR OR OR FOLKS

02:48:30.533 --> 02:48:33.303
THAT ARE. USING DIESEL TRACTORS

02:48:33.369 --> 02:48:37.607
I MEAN IT'S. AND ANY ANY

02:48:37.674 --> 02:48:39.142
THOUGHTS ON. YEAH I THINK IT'S

02:48:39.209 --> 02:48:40.276
ACTUALLY IT'S TIED INTO THE SAME

02:48:40.343 --> 02:48:42.345
AND I REALLY APPRECIATE BOTH

02:48:42.412 --> 02:48:43.513
THESE QUESTIONS I MEAN RIGHT NOW

02:48:43.580 --> 02:48:45.348
WITH THE HIGH PRICES DUE TO

02:48:45.415 --> 02:48:47.283
PRICE GOUGING AND RESTRICTED

02:48:47.350 --> 02:48:49.285
SUPPLY- DUE TO THE WAR IN

02:48:49.352 --> 02:48:51.921
UKRAINE. IT'S NOW FIFTY DOLLARS

02:48:51.988 --> 02:48:53.690
OR MORE TO DRIVE TWO HUNDRED

02:48:53.756 --> 02:48:55.592
FIFTY MILES IN AN S. U. V. WHERE

02:48:55.658 --> 02:48:57.026
IS AN ELECTRIC VEHICLE IT'S ON

02:48:57.093 --> 02:48:58.995
THE ORDER OF TEN DOLLARS. SO

02:48:59.062 --> 02:49:00.463
THERE IS A SOCIAL ECONOMIC

02:49:00.530 --> 02:49:02.866
INJUSTICE IN NOT INNOVATING MORE

02:49:02.932 --> 02:49:04.968
IN THESE AREAS. CALIFORNIA IS

02:49:05.034 --> 02:49:06.536
THE BIGGEST VEHICLE MARC IN THE

02:49:06.603 --> 02:49:08.638
COUNTRY. IS THE BIGGEST DRIVER

02:49:08.705 --> 02:49:11.207
IN DEMAND WHEN PRESIDENT BIDEN

02:49:11.274 --> 02:49:12.942
GOT INTO AN F. ONE FIFTY

02:49:13.009 --> 02:49:15.011
LIGHTNING A MIDDLE YEAR HIGH AND

02:49:15.078 --> 02:49:16.880
EXPENSIVE PICKUP TRUCK. HE WAS

02:49:16.946 --> 02:49:18.715
SENDING A VERY CRITICAL MESSAGE.

02:49:18.781 --> 02:49:20.650
AND THEN RECENT AGREEMENTS TO

02:49:20.717 --> 02:49:23.152
ALLOW POWERING OF HOMES. FROM

02:49:23.219 --> 02:49:25.021
ELECTRIC VEHICLES IS A START IN

02:49:25.088 --> 02:49:27.123
THE SO CALLED VEHICLE TO GRID SO

02:49:27.190 --> 02:49:28.725
THERE'S A LONG TERM STRATEGY

02:49:28.791 --> 02:49:29.926
THAT WILL BENEFIT ALL

02:49:29.993 --> 02:49:31.461
CALIFORNIANS NOT JUST THE MOST

02:49:31.528 --> 02:49:33.396
AFFLUENT. BUT IN THE SHORT TERM.

02:49:33.463 --> 02:49:34.898
WITH BRIGHT WITH GAS PRICES IN

02:49:34.964 --> 02:49:37.033
CALIFORNIA NOW CLIMBING TOWARD

02:49:37.100 --> 02:49:39.202
SIX DOLLARS A MORE GALLON. OUR

02:49:39.269 --> 02:49:40.970
STRATEGY IS GOING TO HAVE TO BE

02:49:41.037 --> 02:49:43.239
TIED INTO ADDITIONAL SHORT TERM

02:49:43.306 --> 02:49:45.341
SUPPLY NOT ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT

02:49:45.408 --> 02:49:47.677
IN LONG TERM OIL AND GAS. BUT IN

02:49:47.744 --> 02:49:48.511
WORKING WITH THE FEDERAL

02:49:48.578 --> 02:49:49.546
GOVERNMENT TO RELEASE MORE

02:49:49.612 --> 02:49:50.947
PETROLEUM FROM THE STURGE

02:49:51.014 --> 02:49:53.716
PETROLEUM RESERVE. AND TO FIND

02:49:53.783 --> 02:49:55.818
OPPORTUNITIES SO THAT IN THE

02:49:55.885 --> 02:49:59.255
MEDIUM TERM. WE CAN GET THE AUTO

02:49:59.322 --> 02:50:01.858
MANUFACTURERS TO FOCUS MORE ON

02:50:01.925 --> 02:50:03.459
THE VEHICLES THAT WE SEE AS

02:50:03.526 --> 02:50:05.094
CRITICAL AND AGAIN WE HEARD FROM

02:50:05.161 --> 02:50:06.729
SEVERAL WITNESSES CALIFORNIA'S

02:50:06.796 --> 02:50:08.498
CRITICAL- AGRICULTURAL

02:50:08.565 --> 02:50:10.266
PRODUCTION IS ALSO A HUGE

02:50:10.333 --> 02:50:12.435
DEMAND. THAT'S NOT GOING TO FIX

02:50:12.502 --> 02:50:14.103
THE PROBLEM TOMORROW MORNING BUT

02:50:14.170 --> 02:50:15.438
WE ARE LIKELY TO SEE

02:50:15.505 --> 02:50:17.574
UNFORTUNATELY YOU MORE CRISES

02:50:17.640 --> 02:50:20.109
LIKE UKRAINE NOT LESS OVERTIME

02:50:20.176 --> 02:50:22.045
AS RESOURCES GET FOUGHT OVER IN

02:50:22.111 --> 02:50:23.913
DIFFERENT WAYS. AND SO THAT

02:50:23.980 --> 02:50:26.316
TRANSITION STRATEGY IS ONE THAT

02:50:26.382 --> 02:50:28.518
CAN IF WE CAN REVERSE THIS BIAS

02:50:28.585 --> 02:50:30.720
TOWARDS THE RICHEST FIRST WHICH

02:50:30.787 --> 02:50:31.854
IS REALLY WHAT CALIFORNIA'S

02:50:31.921 --> 02:50:34.324
CLIMATE LAWS ALL ABOUT. SB

02:50:34.390 --> 02:50:35.625
THIRTY TWO WOULD NOT HAVE PASSED

02:50:35.692 --> 02:50:38.962
WITHOUT STRONG SUPPORT. FROM THE

02:50:39.028 --> 02:50:40.129
RAMAGE ESTES COMMUNITY THAT'S

02:50:40.196 --> 02:50:44.767
WHAT WE NEED TO. FOR MMHM- IT

02:50:44.834 --> 02:50:46.436
ONE OF THE OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS

02:50:46.502 --> 02:50:49.339
IS TO ACCELERATE THE TIME LINES

02:50:49.405 --> 02:50:52.475
FOR OFFSHORE WIND- MR GARCIA

02:50:52.542 --> 02:50:54.677
RATE RAISE THIS POINT EARLIER WE

02:50:54.744 --> 02:50:55.678
ARE AT A CONFERENCE LAST WEEK-

02:50:55.745 --> 02:50:58.081
WHERE. YOU KNOW THEY THEY THEY

02:50:58.147 --> 02:51:01.117
TALKED ABOUT- YOU KNOW HOW IT

02:51:01.184 --> 02:51:03.252
THERE THERE THERE IS. LIKE AFTER

02:51:03.319 --> 02:51:04.621
WHEN COMPANIES WERE WERE SAYING

02:51:04.687 --> 02:51:06.789
THAT THEY'RE READY TO BOOK IT TO

02:51:06.856 --> 02:51:09.192
HAVE PROJECTS TO COME ONLINE AND

02:51:09.258 --> 02:51:11.160
YET IT TAKES LIKE LIKE UP TO TEN

02:51:11.227 --> 02:51:13.830
YEARS TO GET THE TRANSMISSION

02:51:13.896 --> 02:51:18.968
GRID- HOOK UP- AND HOW DO WE

02:51:19.035 --> 02:51:21.104
ACCELERATE THAT. SO THERE'S NO

02:51:21.170 --> 02:51:22.805
UNFORTUNATELY ESY ANSWER THIS

02:51:22.872 --> 02:51:25.875
ONE THE PACK WAVE. WAVE TEST

02:51:25.942 --> 02:51:27.343
SITE IN SOUTHERN OREGON IS AN

02:51:27.410 --> 02:51:29.112
EXAMPLE OF HAVING HOOK UPS IN

02:51:29.178 --> 02:51:31.147
PLACE. THE ONE OF THE REASONS

02:51:31.214 --> 02:51:33.850
WHY HUMBOLDT BAY WAS CHOSEN. AS

02:51:33.916 --> 02:51:36.085
ONE OF OUR TWO EARLY BLOCKS IS

02:51:36.152 --> 02:51:37.153
BECAUSE THE TRANSMISSION

02:51:37.220 --> 02:51:39.122
CAPACITY WHILE NOT FULLY BUILT

02:51:39.188 --> 02:51:40.723
WAS PLANNED FOR THE NUCLEAR

02:51:40.790 --> 02:51:42.191
IRONICALLY FOR THE NUCLEAR POWER

02:51:42.258 --> 02:51:44.060
PLANT IT WAS THAT WAS STOP

02:51:44.127 --> 02:51:46.562
DECADES AGO. SO THERE'S

02:51:46.629 --> 02:51:48.831
OPPORTUNITIES TO TIE THAT IN.

02:51:48.898 --> 02:51:49.966
ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENTS ARE

02:51:50.033 --> 02:51:52.969
CRITICAL BUT- ALMOST EVERYONE I

02:51:53.036 --> 02:51:54.570
TALKED WITH THERE ARE SOME

02:51:54.637 --> 02:51:56.973
EXCEPTIONS BELIEVES THAT. FROM

02:51:57.040 --> 02:51:59.275
OFF SHORE TO SHORE CONNECTIONS

02:51:59.342 --> 02:52:01.711
IS THE MOST EFFICIENT- NEW

02:52:01.778 --> 02:52:03.780
TRANSMISSION LINES TO PUT IN-

02:52:03.846 --> 02:52:05.982
ENVIRONMENT FISH ALL HAVE RIGHTS

02:52:06.049 --> 02:52:08.251
BUT OUR ABILITY TO WORK THE

02:52:08.317 --> 02:52:09.118
JUSTICE ANGLES AND YOU DO THE

02:52:09.185 --> 02:52:11.421
EIA IS. LARGELY BECAUSE CHINA

02:52:11.487 --> 02:52:13.489
AND EUROPE ARE SO FAR AHEAD OF

02:52:13.556 --> 02:52:15.191
US THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT GOALS

02:52:15.258 --> 02:52:18.061
LIKE FIFTY AND SIXTY GIGAWATTS.

02:52:18.127 --> 02:52:20.063
WHEREAS WE HAVE ZERO IN PLACE

02:52:20.129 --> 02:52:22.098
RIGHT NOW SO THE OPPORTUNITY TO

02:52:22.165 --> 02:52:25.401
CATCH UP. IS A FAIRLY BORING ONE

02:52:25.468 --> 02:52:27.403
IN THE SENSE THAT WE WON'T CATCH

02:52:27.470 --> 02:52:29.872
UP BY DOING STUDY AFTER STUDY WE

02:52:29.939 --> 02:52:31.774
NEED HARDWARE IN THE WATER.

02:52:31.841 --> 02:52:33.176
BECAUSE THE ONLY WAY YOU LEARN

02:52:33.242 --> 02:52:35.044
WHAT WORKS BEST FOR COMMUNITIES

02:52:35.111 --> 02:52:37.113
THE ONLY WAY YOU BRING IN THE

02:52:37.180 --> 02:52:39.015
JOBS COMPONENTS IS TO GET SOME

02:52:39.082 --> 02:52:40.550
INITIAL OFFSHORE TURBINES AND SO

02:52:40.616 --> 02:52:43.753
GETTING EVEN VERY SMALL OFFSHORE

02:52:43.820 --> 02:52:46.789
WIND FARMS. FIXED AND THEN THE

02:52:46.856 --> 02:52:47.724
HEART MORE DIFFICULT FLOATING

02:52:47.790 --> 02:52:51.094
ONES. IS THE BEST IT IS THE BEST

02:52:51.160 --> 02:52:53.296
ANALYTICS AND AGAIN IT BEATS ANY

02:52:53.362 --> 02:52:54.197
MODEL THAT I COULD BUILD OR

02:52:54.263 --> 02:52:55.765
ANYONE ELSE COULD BUILD BECAUSE

02:52:55.832 --> 02:52:57.834
WE SIMPLY NEED TO SEE THOSE IN

02:52:57.900 --> 02:52:59.502
THE GROUND TO LEARN. WHAT WORKS

02:52:59.569 --> 02:53:00.169
AND WHAT DOESN'T THANKFULLY WE

02:53:00.236 --> 02:53:02.138
HAVE A GREAT RESOURCE. IT DID IF

02:53:02.205 --> 02:53:03.840
I HEARD YOU RIGHT AND SO WE ARE

02:53:03.906 --> 02:53:05.308
YOU SUGGESTING THE RIGHT CITING

02:53:05.374 --> 02:53:07.243
AS WELL AS WHAT SEEK WITH

02:53:07.310 --> 02:53:08.244
STREAMLINING I WOULD I WOULD

02:53:08.311 --> 02:53:10.146
YEAH I WOULD DO INITIAL LINES TO

02:53:10.213 --> 02:53:12.181
BOTH THE MORO BAY SITE AND THE

02:53:12.248 --> 02:53:13.049
HUMBOLDT BAY ARE QUITE GOOD

02:53:13.116 --> 02:53:15.051
INITIAL SITES. I WOULD START

02:53:15.118 --> 02:53:18.020
WITH SMALL PILOT PROJECTS A FEW

02:53:18.087 --> 02:53:20.123
TURBINES. AND THEN I WOULD BUILD

02:53:20.189 --> 02:53:22.992
OUT FROM THERE- AND AGAIN THE

02:53:23.059 --> 02:53:24.794
IDEA THAT WE COULD BE AT TEN

02:53:24.861 --> 02:53:26.963
GIGAWATTS OF OFFSHORE WIND BY

02:53:27.029 --> 02:53:28.164
THE END OF THIS DECADE AND I'VE

02:53:28.231 --> 02:53:29.298
SEEN ESTIMATES FROM DIFFERENT

02:53:29.365 --> 02:53:30.900
GROUPS MIGHT MY LABS MORE

02:53:30.967 --> 02:53:33.136
AGGRESSIVE OTHERS TALK ABOUT

02:53:33.202 --> 02:53:35.037
THREE GIGAWATTS. WE CAN GET

02:53:35.104 --> 02:53:36.139
TOWARDS THAT TEN WORSE WE'RE

02:53:36.205 --> 02:53:37.507
TALKING ABOUT A QUARTER OR MORE

02:53:37.573 --> 02:53:39.408
OF CALIFORNIA'S ENERGY NOT JUST

02:53:39.475 --> 02:53:41.010
ELECTRICITY BUT GREEN HYDROGEN

02:53:41.077 --> 02:53:43.646
TO. BY THE END OF THIS DECADE

02:53:43.713 --> 02:53:45.448
COMING FROM SECTOR THAT DOES NOT

02:53:45.515 --> 02:53:47.283
EXIST TODAY. AND IT'S THE ONE

02:53:47.350 --> 02:53:48.217
THAT THE DEPART THE FEDERAL

02:53:48.284 --> 02:53:49.786
DEPARTMENT OF LABOR. LOOKS AT AS

02:53:49.852 --> 02:53:52.255
THE LARGEST POTENTIAL NEW JOB

02:53:52.321 --> 02:53:54.423
CREATING INDUSTRY OF ANY ENERGY

02:53:54.490 --> 02:53:56.559
SECTOR IN THE COUNTRY PERIOD

02:53:56.626 --> 02:53:58.795
FULL STOP NO FOOTNOTE. THAT'S A

02:53:58.861 --> 02:54:01.197
REAL OPPORTUNITY TO INVEST IN

02:54:01.264 --> 02:54:05.067
CALIFORNIA WORKERS. THANK YOU

02:54:05.134 --> 02:54:09.405
SEE NO YES- IS HOW DO THAN

02:54:09.472 --> 02:54:10.306
CENTER SKINNER THANK YOU MISTER

02:54:10.373 --> 02:54:11.874
CHAIR AND TRUST ME WHEN I SAY I

02:54:11.941 --> 02:54:13.242
WANT TO PERSONALLY ALSO REACH

02:54:13.309 --> 02:54:16.479
OUT TO YOU AND I KNOW YOU HAVE

02:54:16.546 --> 02:54:17.713
TO GO TO HEAR OTHER- APPOINTMENT

02:54:17.780 --> 02:54:19.982
I REALIZE THE TIME TO WE HAVE TO

02:54:20.049 --> 02:54:21.117
CATCH A FLIGHT TO GO BACK HOME

02:54:21.184 --> 02:54:23.152
I'M A BIG SUPPORTER OF ROOFTOP

02:54:23.219 --> 02:54:25.054
SOLAR I'M BUT MOST OF FROM LOS

02:54:25.121 --> 02:54:27.790
ANGELES. SO OUR WEATHER IS VERY

02:54:27.857 --> 02:54:29.225
DIFFERENT THAN THE REST OF THE

02:54:29.292 --> 02:54:30.493
STATE I'M ALSO A HUGE SUPPORTER

02:54:30.560 --> 02:54:32.228
OF THE GREEN NEW DEAL AND THE

02:54:32.295 --> 02:54:33.963
PILLARS OF THE GREEN NEW DEAL

02:54:34.030 --> 02:54:35.131
WHICH INCLUDE THE JUST

02:54:35.198 --> 02:54:36.332
TRANSITION OF WORKERS ENSURE

02:54:36.399 --> 02:54:38.267
ENSURING THAT YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT

02:54:38.334 --> 02:54:40.203
LEAVING PEOPLE BEHIND US WE TRY

02:54:40.269 --> 02:54:41.737
TO MOVE FORWARD WITH WHAT WITH

02:54:41.804 --> 02:54:43.673
OUR FUTURE LOOKS LIKE. IN A

02:54:43.739 --> 02:54:45.408
CONVERSATION THAT I HAD WITH A

02:54:45.474 --> 02:54:46.108
COLLEAGUE WHO LIVES BY THE

02:54:46.175 --> 02:54:48.411
REDWOODS THE CONVERSATION ON

02:54:48.477 --> 02:54:49.779
ROOFTOP SOLAR WAS A LITTLE BIT

02:54:49.846 --> 02:54:51.747
DIFFERENT TO SIMPLY BECAUSE SOME

02:54:51.814 --> 02:54:53.583
MIGHT DOESN'T GET TO THE ROOFTOP

02:54:53.649 --> 02:54:55.384
SOLAR AS MUCH AS YOU KNOW LOS

02:54:55.451 --> 02:54:56.819
ANGELES AND THAT REALLY MADE ME

02:54:56.886 --> 02:54:59.355
THINK ABOUT. WHAT WE OFTEN TALK

02:54:59.422 --> 02:55:01.023
ABOUT IS A DIVERSE RENEWABLE

02:55:01.090 --> 02:55:02.592
ENERGY PORTFOLIO SO WHAT DOES

02:55:02.658 --> 02:55:04.293
THAT LOOK LIKE AND WHAT ARE THE

02:55:04.360 --> 02:55:07.563
COSTS RELATED TO EACH OF THESE

02:55:07.630 --> 02:55:08.231
DIFFERENT TYPES OF METHODS HAVE

02:55:08.297 --> 02:55:09.065
YOU DONE OR DO YOU HAVE

02:55:09.131 --> 02:55:10.800
INFORMATION ON LIKE A COST

02:55:10.867 --> 02:55:12.235
COMPARISON ANALYSIS WHEN IT

02:55:12.301 --> 02:55:14.170
COMES TO WHAT THAT ACTUALLY

02:55:14.237 --> 02:55:16.239
LOOKS LIKE FOR- CARBON

02:55:16.305 --> 02:55:18.574
REDUCTIONS THROUGH ROOFTOP SOLAR

02:55:18.641 --> 02:55:20.743
VERSES OTHER YOU KNOW OTHER

02:55:20.810 --> 02:55:22.578
APPROACHES. SUCH A LONGER%

02:55:22.645 --> 02:55:24.146
CONVERSATION I'D FOLLOW UP AND

02:55:24.213 --> 02:55:25.548
FOLLOW UP WITH YOU AFTERWARDS

02:55:25.615 --> 02:55:28.084
BUT BOTH MY LABORATORY AND GREAT

02:55:28.150 --> 02:55:29.452
AND GREAT GREAT ALTERNATIVES

02:55:29.518 --> 02:55:31.020
USED TO BE CALLED BASE TO HEAR

02:55:31.087 --> 02:55:32.822
AND- IT BUT BASS NO CALIFORNIA

02:55:32.889 --> 02:55:34.757
AND TO THE SOCIAL JUSTICE ENERGY

02:55:34.824 --> 02:55:36.659
LAB AT UCLA RUN BY PROFESSOR

02:55:36.726 --> 02:55:39.028
STEPHANIE PINTLE. THOSE ARE ALL

02:55:39.095 --> 02:55:41.063
LOOKED AT THIS I USED TO LIVE IN

02:55:41.130 --> 02:55:42.098
AN APARTMENT IN NEWIN WEST

02:55:42.164 --> 02:55:43.900
HOLLYWOOD ON FAIRFAX AND WE HAD

02:55:43.966 --> 02:55:46.402
THESE VERY FOGGY LONG MORNINGS

02:55:46.469 --> 02:55:47.937
THAT'S WHERE THIS TRADE OFF

02:55:48.004 --> 02:55:50.072
BETWEEN SOME COLLECTIVE SOLAR

02:55:50.139 --> 02:55:52.041
SUCH AS THE ON THE SURFACE ON ON

02:55:52.108 --> 02:55:54.477
THE ROOF OF SAFEWAY OR RALPHS

02:55:54.543 --> 02:55:56.379
GROCERY STORES SHARED BY THE

02:55:56.445 --> 02:55:58.514
COMMUNITY IS AN EXCELLENT WAY TO

02:55:58.581 --> 02:56:00.016
MOVE AHEAD BECAUSE THOSE LARGER

02:56:00.082 --> 02:56:02.485
REYES. USED TO BE SIGNIFICANTLY

02:56:02.551 --> 02:56:07.657
CHEAPER BUT AS. THE PRICES DROP

02:56:07.723 --> 02:56:09.225
AND DROP FOR SOLAR. THE RALPH.

02:56:09.292 --> 02:56:11.093
SOLAR POWER IS REALLY NO LONGER

02:56:11.160 --> 02:56:12.161
THE RATE LIMITING COST STEP IT'S

02:56:12.228 --> 02:56:13.095
THE INTEGRATION IT'S THE WORK

02:56:13.162 --> 02:56:14.730
WITH UTILITY OR THE MUD

02:56:14.797 --> 02:56:16.332
DEPENDING WHERE ONE'S WORKING

02:56:16.399 --> 02:56:18.167
AND IT'S THERE WHERE THE LOCAL

02:56:18.234 --> 02:56:19.869
RESTRICTIONS REALLY MATTERS BUT

02:56:19.936 --> 02:56:21.837
IT'S ALSO THERE WHERE THE JOBS

02:56:21.904 --> 02:56:23.139
BENEFITS CAN BE THE HIGHEST

02:56:23.205 --> 02:56:25.474
BECAUSE ONE IRONY OF SMALL SCALE

02:56:25.541 --> 02:56:27.643
DISTRIBUTED ROOFTOP SOLAR IS

02:56:27.710 --> 02:56:29.645
THAT JUST MORE JOBS PER DOLLAR

02:56:29.712 --> 02:56:31.847
PER MEGAWATT SO YOU KIND OF GOT

02:56:31.914 --> 02:56:33.916
A BIT OF A BALANCE THERE AND I

02:56:33.983 --> 02:56:35.217
THINK THAT'S A PLACE WHERE. ALL

02:56:35.284 --> 02:56:38.020
OF THE ABOVE FOR SOLAR BUT ALSO

02:56:38.087 --> 02:56:39.889
FOR LOCALLY DEPLOYED STORAGE

02:56:39.956 --> 02:56:42.858
ENDS UP BEING A REAL WIN AT THE

02:56:42.925 --> 02:56:48.531
COMMUNITY LEVEL. SANDERS CAN.

02:56:48.597 --> 02:56:51.400
THANK YOU CHAIR I KNOW I'VE

02:56:51.467 --> 02:56:53.235
THANK YOU FIRST CAME IN FOR-

02:56:53.302 --> 02:56:54.437
COMING AND SHARING YOUR

02:56:54.503 --> 02:56:57.873
THOUGHTS- A COUPLE COMMENTS AND

02:56:57.940 --> 02:56:59.675
QUESTIONS- I VERY MUCH

02:56:59.742 --> 02:57:02.645
APPRECIATE YOUR- ELABORATION ON

02:57:02.712 --> 02:57:04.347
THE YOU KNOW THE WAY YOU FEEL

02:57:04.413 --> 02:57:06.282
MIGHT BE THE WEAKNESSES OF THE

02:57:06.349 --> 02:57:09.852
PC'S- PENDING DECISION AND I

02:57:09.919 --> 02:57:12.054
WONDERED IF YOU COULD TALK A

02:57:12.121 --> 02:57:12.922
LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THE ROLE

02:57:12.989 --> 02:57:15.257
YOU MENTIONED MICRO GRIDS. AND

02:57:15.324 --> 02:57:18.761
WHILE THE STATE HAS NOT YET AND

02:57:18.828 --> 02:57:20.629
I THINK IT'S UNFORTUNATE BUT WE

02:57:20.696 --> 02:57:27.837
HAVE NOT YET- OPENED UP FOR

02:57:27.903 --> 02:57:31.741
PLANNED FOR THAT ABILITY OF MY

02:57:31.807 --> 02:57:34.510
GROUP GRIDS TO HELP US ACHIEVE

02:57:34.577 --> 02:57:36.846
OUR- STABILITY ON THE GRID IN

02:57:36.912 --> 02:57:40.850
OUR RESILIENCY AND I OF COURSE

02:57:40.916 --> 02:57:43.052
ROOFTOP SOLAR WITH STORAGE AND

02:57:43.119 --> 02:57:44.820
THAT COULD BE ROOFTOP SOLAR ON

02:57:44.887 --> 02:57:46.355
COMMERCIAL PUBLIC FACILITIES AS

02:57:46.422 --> 02:57:49.058
WELL AS RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES

02:57:49.125 --> 02:57:51.394
COULD PLAY OR NOT ONLY COULD IS

02:57:51.460 --> 02:57:55.564
ESSENTIAL TO A TO A MARGARET- IN

02:57:55.631 --> 02:57:58.334
MY ONE OF MY OBJECTIONS TO THE

02:57:58.401 --> 02:57:59.835
PENDING DECISION WAS EXACTLY THE

02:57:59.902 --> 02:58:01.670
POINT THAT COULD PRECLUDE OUR

02:58:01.737 --> 02:58:04.640
ABILITY. WHICH I FEEL WE NEED TO

02:58:04.707 --> 02:58:06.642
EXPLORE NOT ONLY FOR GRID

02:58:06.709 --> 02:58:09.612
STABILITY BUT ALSO FOR- WE HAVE

02:58:09.678 --> 02:58:11.747
TO DO POWER OUTAGES AT TIMES

02:58:11.814 --> 02:58:13.549
WHETHER AS WILDFIRE OTHER

02:58:13.616 --> 02:58:16.018
REASONS AND ARE BECAUSE OF THE

02:58:16.085 --> 02:58:18.254
WAY THE GRID IS NOW YOU KNOW OUR

02:58:18.320 --> 02:58:20.523
DAD IS NOW DESIGN THEY HAVE TO

02:58:20.589 --> 02:58:22.358
BE IN LARGE AREAS VERSUS MORE

02:58:22.425 --> 02:58:26.362
TARGETED AND. A MICROGRID WOULD

02:58:26.429 --> 02:58:29.031
PRESERVE. I PLACE TO HAVE THEIR

02:58:29.098 --> 02:58:31.267
NEED POWER THAT OTHER THAT

02:58:31.333 --> 02:58:34.437
TURNED SO WOULDYOU MIND IF YOU

02:58:34.503 --> 02:58:35.037
BRIEFLY- ON THE BUT FINE MY

02:58:35.104 --> 02:58:38.541
OTHER. IS AROUND YOUR SENSE OF

02:58:38.607 --> 02:58:42.711
HOW HOW QUICKLY. GREEN HYDROGEN

02:58:42.778 --> 02:58:44.146
MIGHT BE ACTUALLY COMMERCIALLY

02:58:44.213 --> 02:58:47.216
VIABLE IN FOR AND I AND I AM

02:58:47.283 --> 02:58:48.384
WITHOUT PURCHASING GREEN

02:58:48.451 --> 02:58:50.186
HYDROGEN THE Y. FEEL THAT THERE

02:58:50.252 --> 02:58:51.954
ARE PROBABLY CERTAIN USES THAT

02:58:52.021 --> 02:58:54.857
WOULD BE FAR MORE. A BENEFICIAL

02:58:54.924 --> 02:58:56.692
TO US YOU KNOW LIKE FOR EXAMPLE

02:58:56.759 --> 02:59:00.663
IN HEAVY DUTY LONG LONG. PAUL

02:59:00.729 --> 02:59:02.531
VEHICLE- TRUCKS AND GOODS

02:59:02.598 --> 02:59:04.900
MOVEMENT HOWEVER. PART OF THE

02:59:04.967 --> 02:59:07.436
ISSUE IS YOU KNOW WHAT BOTH WHAT

02:59:07.503 --> 02:59:09.605
WE NEED TO DO TO HELP IT. COME

02:59:09.672 --> 02:59:11.107
TO BE COMMERCIALLY VIABLE AND

02:59:11.173 --> 02:59:13.609
THEN HOW SOON DO YOU THINK IT

02:59:13.676 --> 02:59:14.143
WOULD BE AND I'M TALKING

02:59:14.210 --> 02:59:16.612
GRIGNARD. YEAH WELL ACTUALLY THE

02:59:16.679 --> 02:59:18.214
ENERGY INNOVATION MODEL HAS A

02:59:18.280 --> 02:59:21.183
REALLY IMPORTANT SECTION ON

02:59:21.250 --> 02:59:22.918
LEADING OPPORTUNITIES FOR GREEN

02:59:22.985 --> 02:59:24.987
HYDROGEN. AGAIN THE MORE WE

02:59:25.054 --> 02:59:27.389
BUILD OUT OFFSHORE WIND THE MORE

02:59:27.456 --> 02:59:29.558
WE GET THAT UNGIBLE SUPPLIED

02:59:29.625 --> 02:59:31.393
BECAUSE THEY CAN SELL LIKE

02:59:31.460 --> 02:59:31.927
TRICITY WENT PRICES HIGH

02:59:31.994 --> 02:59:33.229
HYDROGEN WHEN THE PRICE OF

02:59:33.295 --> 02:59:35.297
ELECTRICITY IS LOW. BUT BUILDING

02:59:35.364 --> 02:59:37.666
OUT SOME INDUSTRIAL CLUSTERS IS

02:59:37.733 --> 02:59:40.603
THE MODEL THAT BOTH THE E. U.

02:59:40.669 --> 02:59:41.637
AND THE U. K. HAVE ADOPTED

02:59:41.704 --> 02:59:44.073
FIRST. LONG BEACH IS A NATURAL

02:59:44.140 --> 02:59:45.608
PLACE TO DO IT PORT OF OAKLAND

02:59:45.674 --> 02:59:47.409
IS A NATURAL PLACE TO DO IT SAN

02:59:47.476 --> 02:59:49.979
DIEGO TO DO BOTH INDUSTRY AND

02:59:50.045 --> 02:59:51.947
THE MILITARY ARE PLACES WHERE

02:59:52.014 --> 02:59:54.650
FIX DEMANDS REALLY HELP- IN THIS

02:59:54.717 --> 02:59:55.818
WILL TIE BACK TO THE GREEN

02:59:55.885 --> 02:59:57.453
CEMENT QUESTIONS AS WELL BECAUSE

02:59:57.520 --> 02:59:57.987
THEY WERE GOING TO BUILD

02:59:58.053 --> 02:59:59.054
INFRASTRUCTURE WE WANT TO DO

02:59:59.121 --> 03:00:02.057
THAT AND IS YOUR CARBON WAY. SO

03:00:02.124 --> 03:00:03.125
WE DO NOT HAVE THE CURRENT

03:00:03.192 --> 03:00:05.027
DEMAND FOR THAT HYDROGEN BUT

03:00:05.094 --> 03:00:06.929
THIS IS A CASE WHERE CALIFORNIA

03:00:06.996 --> 03:00:08.330
CAN REALLY CREATE THAT SO I

03:00:08.397 --> 03:00:09.064
THINK THERE'S A PLACE WHERE

03:00:09.131 --> 03:00:11.567
AGAIN THE TWO OTHER- PANELISTS.

03:00:11.634 --> 03:00:13.202
HAVE SOME VERY SPECIFIC POINTS

03:00:13.269 --> 03:00:15.004
FOR THOSE TO BE THE THREE HUBS

03:00:15.070 --> 03:00:16.472
THAT I WOULD RECOMMEND FOR

03:00:16.539 --> 03:00:18.007
REGIONAL AND THEY HAPPEN TO BE

03:00:18.073 --> 03:00:18.974
DISTRIBUTED ACROSS THE STATE

03:00:19.041 --> 03:00:20.576
WHICH IS CONVENIENT. SO WE WOULD

03:00:20.643 --> 03:00:22.745
BUILD OUT SOME GREEN HYDROGEN

03:00:22.811 --> 03:00:26.282
INFRASTRUCTURE AND REWARD USE.

03:00:26.348 --> 03:00:28.584
AND THE BEST WAY TO REWARD USE

03:00:28.651 --> 03:00:30.519
IS TO GO BACK TO THE SOCIAL COST

03:00:30.586 --> 03:00:31.120
OF CARBON. BECAUSE IF WE WERE

03:00:31.187 --> 03:00:32.821
UTILIZING A SOCIAL COST OF

03:00:32.888 --> 03:00:34.223
CARBON HEIGHT WHICH IS HIGHER

03:00:34.290 --> 03:00:35.858
THAN THE MARKET PRICE. WE WILL

03:00:35.925 --> 03:00:37.393
BE REWARDING THAT GREEN HYDROGEN

03:00:37.459 --> 03:00:38.827
EXACTLY IN THOSE IN THOSE

03:00:38.894 --> 03:00:40.829
CENTERS SO I AGREE I AGREE WITH

03:00:40.896 --> 03:00:42.765
YOU ON THAT ONE ON THE MICROGRID

03:00:42.831 --> 03:00:44.066
STORE I COULDN'T AGREE WITH YOU

03:00:44.133 --> 03:00:45.768
MORE AND IN FACT. THE GLOBAL

03:00:45.834 --> 03:00:47.403
PICTURE HAS MOVED ON SO MY DAY

03:00:47.469 --> 03:00:49.405
JOB RIGHT NOW IS NOT AT UC

03:00:49.471 --> 03:00:51.273
BERKELEY WHERE I'M PROFESSOR BUT

03:00:51.340 --> 03:00:53.209
I'M THE ENERGY ADVISER FOR U. S.

03:00:53.275 --> 03:00:54.910
AGENCY FOR NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT

03:00:54.977 --> 03:00:56.679
THE BY THE MINISTRATION. WE ARE

03:00:56.745 --> 03:01:01.183
NOW SEEING SO CALLED METRO GRIDS

03:01:01.250 --> 03:01:02.751
. MEETING MOBILE LARGE THAN WE

03:01:02.818 --> 03:01:04.186
MEGA. MAKER GRADES BEING BUILT

03:01:04.253 --> 03:01:06.322
AROUND THE WORLD. FROM RURAL

03:01:06.388 --> 03:01:08.390
COMMUNITIES IN AFRICA TO

03:01:08.457 --> 03:01:10.292
COMMUNITIES IN EUROPE- IN

03:01:10.359 --> 03:01:12.494
SOUTHEAST ASIA. THE ABILITY TO

03:01:12.561 --> 03:01:14.430
BUILD MUCH LARGER MICRO GRIDS

03:01:14.496 --> 03:01:16.899
NOW. PROVIDES MANY MORE PEOPLE

03:01:16.966 --> 03:01:19.768
LIGHT INDUSTRY BUSINESS WITH.

03:01:19.835 --> 03:01:22.438
CLEAN RELIABLE POWER. AND IF WE

03:01:22.504 --> 03:01:24.940
REWARD. THE UTILITIES THE I'LL

03:01:25.007 --> 03:01:27.643
USE. FOR TYING THOSE IN AS

03:01:27.710 --> 03:01:29.144
OPPOSED TO PUNISHING THEM WHICH

03:01:29.211 --> 03:01:30.579
HAS BEEN THEIR PERCEPTION ON HOW

03:01:30.646 --> 03:01:31.914
WE PUSH THIS PRODUCT. THIS

03:01:31.981 --> 03:01:33.649
PROCESS FORWARD. I ACTUALLY

03:01:33.716 --> 03:01:34.950
THINK THERE'S A PATHWAY IN FRONT

03:01:35.017 --> 03:01:38.387
OF THE P. U. C. TO ENABLE. MANY

03:01:38.454 --> 03:01:40.623
GRIDS I'M A CALL THE NEWS METRO

03:01:40.689 --> 03:01:42.191
GRIDS BUT TO DO SO IN A WAY THAT

03:01:42.258 --> 03:01:43.759
REALLY BENEFITS. LOWER INCOME

03:01:43.826 --> 03:01:45.461
COMMUNITIES NOT JUST TO AIR

03:01:45.527 --> 03:01:47.830
QUALITY. BUT THROUGH JOBS AND

03:01:47.896 --> 03:01:49.932
THROUGH THE REBUILD A VERY AS WE

03:01:49.999 --> 03:01:51.033
MOST NEED TO DO IT AND AGAIN

03:01:51.100 --> 03:01:53.936
THOSE PORT HUBS RUBY WOULD BE MY

03:01:54.003 --> 03:01:56.205
RECOMMENDED STARTING POINTS. SO

03:01:56.272 --> 03:01:57.439
I JUST I REALLY WANT TO THANK

03:01:57.506 --> 03:01:59.241
EVERYONE I AM NOW PROBABLY AT A

03:01:59.308 --> 03:02:01.210
POINT WHEN I MET A GIRL IN MY

03:02:01.277 --> 03:02:02.845
CAR AND THEY GET ON MY-

03:02:02.911 --> 03:02:04.480
TESTIMONY BUT I WANT TO THANK

03:02:04.546 --> 03:02:05.848
YOU ALL I. LOOK FORWARD TO

ALREADY- HAD A SUCCESSFUL LOTS A

03:02:46.922 --> 03:02:47.823
SUCCESSFUL BILL THAT'S NOW

03:02:47.890 --> 03:02:49.224
SIGNED INTO LAW IN EFFECT THAT

03:02:49.291 --> 03:02:52.661
WOULD BRING DOWN THE- ENERGY

03:02:52.728 --> 03:02:57.499
INPUT- EMISSIONS RELATED TO

03:02:57.566 --> 03:03:00.169
CEMENT AND CALLS FOR CEMENT OVER

03:03:00.235 --> 03:03:03.872
ALL PRODUCTION IN CALIFORNIA.

03:03:03.939 --> 03:03:05.274
TOO GPO KEEPING GIVE THE EXACT

03:03:05.341 --> 03:03:08.944
GOAL BUT BUT IN BEING ABLE TO

03:03:09.011 --> 03:03:11.146
ACHIEVE THAT THE CEMENT INDUSTRY

03:03:11.213 --> 03:03:13.949
WILL HAVE TO DEAL WITH ITS

03:03:14.016 --> 03:03:15.984
PROCESS EMISSIONS SO I HAVE A

03:03:16.051 --> 03:03:17.686
BILL THAT I'VE INTRODUCED THIS

03:03:17.753 --> 03:03:19.788
YEAR TO ALLOW FOR SOME PILOT

03:03:19.855 --> 03:03:24.159
PROJECTS TO- CAPTURE THE PROCESS

03:03:24.226 --> 03:03:26.128
EMISSIONS AND STORE THEM

03:03:26.195 --> 03:03:28.430
GEOLOGICALLY. AND I WONDERED IF

03:03:28.497 --> 03:03:30.199
YOU WANTED TO COMMENT EITHER ON

03:03:30.265 --> 03:03:31.100
THE SWITCHERS SETS THE

03:03:31.166 --> 03:03:32.601
FEASIBILITY OF THAT GEOLOGIC

03:03:32.668 --> 03:03:34.870
STORAGE WORK THERE'S ANOTHER IF

03:03:34.937 --> 03:03:36.405
THERE'S SOME OTHER THING THAT WE

03:03:36.472 --> 03:03:38.440
SHOULD BE LOOKING AT. IN ORDER

03:03:38.507 --> 03:03:40.042
TO DEAL WITH THE PROCESS

03:03:40.109 --> 03:03:42.945
EMISSIONS FROM CEMENT. YEAH SO

03:03:43.011 --> 03:03:44.580
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE

03:03:44.646 --> 03:03:45.881
QUESTION AND I WOULD ALSO LIKE

03:03:45.948 --> 03:03:47.549
TO THANK BOTH YOU AND SENATOR

03:03:47.616 --> 03:03:49.318
RECORD FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON

03:03:49.385 --> 03:03:50.853
THIS ISSUE. IT'S REALLY

03:03:50.919 --> 03:03:53.422
INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT- AS YOU

03:03:53.489 --> 03:03:56.492
CORRECTLY POINT OUT- THE REASON

03:03:56.558 --> 03:03:59.995
WHY- THE CEMENT INDUSTRY IS IN

03:04:00.062 --> 03:04:01.230
MY OPINION THAT THE CORRECT

03:04:01.296 --> 03:04:02.965
PLACE TO START. WITH ANY

03:04:03.031 --> 03:04:05.167
ACTIVITY AROUND CARBON CAPTURE

03:04:05.234 --> 03:04:07.603
AND STORAGE IS BECAUSE OF THOSE

03:04:07.669 --> 03:04:10.072
PROCESS EMISSIONS. THERE ARE

03:04:10.139 --> 03:04:13.308
IDEAS OUT THERE FOR HOW WE CAN.

03:04:13.375 --> 03:04:15.144
ROUTE ELIMINATE THOSE PROCESS

03:04:15.210 --> 03:04:17.980
EMISSIONS BY WITHOUT THE USE OF

03:04:18.046 --> 03:04:19.648
CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE BUT

03:04:19.715 --> 03:04:23.385
FRANKLY. I WOULD CHARACTERIZE

03:04:23.452 --> 03:04:25.154
THEM AS AT THE LABORATORY STATE

03:04:25.220 --> 03:04:26.188
. WELL SOME OF THEM ARE THE

03:04:26.255 --> 03:04:28.390
LABORATORY STATE SOME OF THEM

03:04:28.457 --> 03:04:29.892
ARE ONLY AVAILABLE AT VERY SMALL

03:04:29.958 --> 03:04:32.761
SCALES SO THEY COULD NOT MEET IN

03:04:32.828 --> 03:04:34.863
A BALK WAY OUR NEED FOR. CEMENT

03:04:34.930 --> 03:04:37.666
AND CONCRETE. SO I THINK THAT

03:04:37.733 --> 03:04:38.400
THAT IS A VERY REASONABLE

03:04:38.467 --> 03:04:40.936
APPROACH. I ALSO THINK THAT IT

03:04:41.003 --> 03:04:43.806
SHOULD BE COUPLED WITH THINGS

03:04:43.872 --> 03:04:47.876
THAT- DO NOT REQUIRE THE SAME

03:04:47.943 --> 03:04:51.613
LEVEL OF A NEW TECHNOLOGY AND

03:04:51.680 --> 03:04:54.016
CAPITAL INVESTMENT LIKE US

03:04:54.082 --> 03:04:57.286
CHANGING. CODES AND STANDARDS

03:04:57.352 --> 03:04:58.153
AND SPECIFICATIONS THROUGH

03:04:58.220 --> 03:05:00.956
CALTRANS TO INCENTIVIZE THE USE

03:05:01.023 --> 03:05:03.959
OF LOS AMEND CONCRETES AND LOW

03:05:04.026 --> 03:05:06.161
CLINKER CEMENTS. BOTH OF WHICH

03:05:06.228 --> 03:05:08.931
CAN REDUCE GREENHOUSE THE

03:05:08.997 --> 03:05:10.966
GREENHOUSE GAS INTENSITY OF

03:05:11.033 --> 03:05:12.534
CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS

03:05:12.601 --> 03:05:15.137
IMMEDIATELY AND WITHOUT MUCH

03:05:15.204 --> 03:05:16.572
TECH WITHOUT ANY TECHNOLOGICAL

03:05:16.638 --> 03:05:19.274
RISK IN MANY CASES AND OFTEN AT

03:05:19.341 --> 03:05:21.743
A COST SAVINGS. WE WANT TO TAKE

03:05:21.810 --> 03:05:23.645
IN ALL OF THE ABOVE APPROACH BUT

03:05:23.712 --> 03:05:25.881
CERTAINLY THIS IS THE RIGHT

03:05:25.948 --> 03:05:29.485
PLACE TO START WITH- OFF ANY

03:05:29.551 --> 03:05:30.552
ACTIVITY AND CARBON CAPTURE AND

03:05:30.619 --> 03:05:33.522
STORAGE. THANK YOU AND- I DIDN'T

03:05:33.589 --> 03:05:35.757
TEND TO DO THAT AT ONE POINT

03:05:35.824 --> 03:05:37.292
FIVE. TO BE HONEST-

03:05:37.359 --> 03:05:38.527
UNFORTUNATELY EVEN REMEMBER WHAT

03:05:38.594 --> 03:05:40.162
THE DISPOSITION WHETHER IT NEVER

03:05:40.229 --> 03:05:42.264
GOT ANYWHERE WHETHER ALTRANS

03:05:42.331 --> 03:05:42.898
TWO THOUSAND IMPLEMENTED BUT IT

03:05:42.965 --> 03:05:45.000
IS A VERY. THAT ISSUE IS VERY

03:05:45.067 --> 03:05:47.135
IMPORTANT BECAUSE YEAHWE ARE

03:05:47.202 --> 03:05:49.171
THE LARGEST USERS OF THE CEMENT

03:05:49.238 --> 03:05:51.707
AND IF WE DON'T. IF WE THE STATE

03:05:51.773 --> 03:05:55.410
OR NOT. DRIVING THE STANDARDS

03:05:55.477 --> 03:05:58.313
FOR THE AGGREGATE TO BE ABSENT

03:05:58.380 --> 03:06:00.582
OF SUCH. BE RECYCLED CONTENT

03:06:00.649 --> 03:06:02.150
OTHERS THE AGGREGATE TO BE SUCH

03:06:02.217 --> 03:06:06.188
THAT IT IS. PARDON LOWER CARBON

03:06:06.255 --> 03:06:07.789
. AND IT'S PROCESSING MEASURE

03:06:07.856 --> 03:06:10.659
THERE WERE BEING PRETTY. YES THE

03:06:47.462 --> 03:06:49.097
TARGET FOR ANY SEGMENT OF THE

CALIFORNIA ECONOMY SO WE DO NOT

03:06:51.300 --> 03:06:54.436
HAVE A NET ZERO TARGET ACTUALLY

03:06:54.503 --> 03:06:57.139
BUILT IN- A BORDER CARBON.

03:06:57.205 --> 03:06:58.874
ESCENARIO NO CAR HAS TO

03:06:58.941 --> 03:07:01.176
IMPLEMENT THAT- BUT THAT WE

03:07:01.243 --> 03:07:02.511
ACTUALLY PROTECT CALIFORNIA'S

03:07:02.578 --> 03:07:04.112
YOUR SUPPORT PART OF WHAT YOU

03:07:04.179 --> 03:07:05.113

03:07:05.180 --> 03:07:07.082
WANT OF COURSE NOT TO DRIVE

03:07:07.149 --> 03:07:08.283
THESE DROPS COMPLETELY OUT OF

03:07:08.350 --> 03:07:09.117
STATE. IT'S TO ACTUALLY MAKE

03:07:09.184 --> 03:07:12.154
CHANGES THAT AFFECT THE GLOBAL

03:07:12.220 --> 03:07:14.389
MARKETS ALTERNATELY- I YOU KNOW

03:07:14.456 --> 03:07:19.428
SO FOR- DR BUSH'S THINK OF OVER

LIKE TO. HAVE THAT. WHICH A

03:07:23.966 --> 03:07:24.933
COUPLE QUICK QUESTIONS TO SET

03:07:25.000 --> 03:07:28.837
THAT- WE HAVE TO MORE THAN- FAR

03:07:28.904 --> 03:07:30.272
PROGRESS TO ME OUR GOALS IS THAT

03:07:30.339 --> 03:07:33.609
WE- THAT'S CORRECT BASED ON-

03:07:33.675 --> 03:07:36.011
COMPARED TO THE FIVE YEAR TRENDS

03:07:36.078 --> 03:07:38.180
WHICH WORKS OUT TO I THINK FOUR

03:07:38.246 --> 03:07:39.781
POINT SEVEN MILLION METRIC TONS

03:07:39.848 --> 03:07:43.552
PER YEAR- OF COURSE IT WILL CALL

03:07:43.619 --> 03:07:44.386
AT FIVE AND THEN IF I'M

03:07:44.453 --> 03:07:47.122
REMEMBERING THE SLIDE CORRECTLY.

03:07:47.189 --> 03:07:49.257
A STRAIGHT LINE PATH TO. TWO

03:07:49.324 --> 03:07:50.025
TWENTY THIRTY WHAT WOULD REQUIRE

03:07:50.092 --> 03:07:51.893
AN AVERAGE REDUCTION OF SIXTEEN

03:07:51.960 --> 03:07:54.396
MM CHIEF PER YEAR ARE MILLION

03:07:54.463 --> 03:07:55.831
METRIC TONS. YES THEY SHOULD

03:07:55.897 --> 03:07:57.299
GIVE US ALL PAUSE YOUR CHANGES

03:07:57.366 --> 03:07:59.067
TO HIT OUR OWN CURRENT GOAL IS

03:07:59.134 --> 03:08:02.104
NOT ONLY TO. HAVE ADDITIONAL-

03:08:02.170 --> 03:08:04.106
AMBITION WE'VE HAD OUR OWN GOALS

03:08:04.172 --> 03:08:06.174
HAVE TO TRIPLE OUR PROGRESS JUST

03:08:06.241 --> 03:08:09.311
TO HAVE HER OWN GOALS THAT'S

03:08:09.378 --> 03:08:10.278
RIGHT. YEAH YEAH I THINK THAT'S

03:08:10.345 --> 03:08:11.279
JUST REALLY OPTIONS ARE

03:08:11.346 --> 03:08:12.748
COLLEAGUES REALLY APPRECIATE

03:08:12.814 --> 03:08:15.484
THAT- AND I THINK THAT'S

03:08:15.550 --> 03:08:16.485
IMPORTANT THAT WE GET THAT

03:08:16.551 --> 03:08:18.620
MESSAGE OUT THE MEASURE GOVERNOR

03:08:18.687 --> 03:08:20.822
ACTUALLY CREATES IT PROBABLY-

03:08:20.889 --> 03:08:21.957
YEAH AND AGAIN WE HAVE THIS

03:08:22.024 --> 03:08:23.492
OPPORTUNITY SURPLUS WE HAVE TO

03:08:23.558 --> 03:08:25.093
DO THAT APPRECIATE YOUR OTHER.

03:08:25.160 --> 03:08:26.895
EXAMPLES OF THE AT THE VERY TAX

03:08:26.962 --> 03:08:28.730
WE DON'T EIGHTY NINE PERCENT.

03:08:28.797 --> 03:08:30.565
AND YOUR CA NINETY THOUSAND

CREATED- INSTANCE THE PRE EVEY

03:08:36.138 --> 03:08:37.973
ERROR IS THAT CORRECT. NOT

KNOWING FRACTURING- COMPARED TO

03:08:39.608 --> 03:08:43.578
THE SO THE NEW ME THE GM TOYOTA

MUGGED ON OCT MANUFACTURING JOBS

03:08:51.920 --> 03:08:53.021
BEFORE THEN THEY WERE NEVER MORE

03:08:53.088 --> 03:08:55.390
THAN NINE THOUSAND AND SO NOW

03:08:55.457 --> 03:08:57.859
WE'RE OVER NINETEEN THOUSAND SO

03:08:57.926 --> 03:09:01.897

THAT HAVE BEEN BANK BUT- ONE OF

03:09:45.774 --> 03:09:47.242
THE REASONS THE EUROPEAN UNION

03:09:47.309 --> 03:09:49.044
IS MOVING TOWARDS THE BORDER

03:09:49.111 --> 03:09:51.179
CARBON ADJUSTMENT MECHANISM

03:09:51.246 --> 03:09:52.447
MECHANISM IS THEY'VE REALIZED

03:09:52.514 --> 03:09:55.650
THAT. ANY FREE ALLOCATION- OVER

03:09:55.717 --> 03:09:58.019
THE LONG RUN HAS SOME CONNECTION

03:09:58.086 --> 03:10:01.089
TO- TURNS OUT TO BE A SUBSIDY

03:10:01.156 --> 03:10:02.491
FOR EXISTING PRODUCTION AND SO

03:10:02.557 --> 03:10:04.893
IT IT IT ENDS UP. UNDERMINING

03:10:04.960 --> 03:10:06.762
THE PRICE SIGNAL IF THERE'S ANY

03:10:06.828 --> 03:10:10.699
FREE ALLOCATION AND- SO THAT-

03:10:10.766 --> 03:10:12.734
YOU KNOW. I THINK THERE'S

03:10:12.801 --> 03:10:15.036
INCREASING RECOGNITION THAT THE

03:10:15.103 --> 03:10:16.872
CARBON PRICES BEST A SWEEPING UP

03:10:16.938 --> 03:10:19.574
US. A SHORT RUN LOW COST SUPPLY

03:10:19.641 --> 03:10:21.443
PRODUCTIONS AND NOT NECESSARILY

03:10:21.510 --> 03:10:25.280
INCENTIVIZING THE INVESTMENTS.

03:10:25.347 --> 03:10:28.950
WE NEED MADE. SO ANY ADVICE FOR

03:10:29.017 --> 03:10:30.886
US IN IN OUR CARBON MARKETS.

03:10:30.952 --> 03:10:36.591
WELL I GUESS GIVEN- YOU KNOW

03:10:36.658 --> 03:10:38.260
AFFORDABILITY CONCERNS IN THE

03:10:38.326 --> 03:10:41.997
INEVITABILITY. OF COST PASSED

03:10:42.063 --> 03:10:44.065
THROUGH IT AND YOU CAN DEAL WITH

03:10:44.132 --> 03:10:45.233
THAT BY USING THE OPTION REVENUE

03:10:45.300 --> 03:10:47.135
UP I'M MORE INCLINED TO POINT

03:10:47.202 --> 03:10:48.904
OUT SOME OF THE DIRECT SECTOR

03:10:48.970 --> 03:10:51.373
STANDARDS WHICH ARE ACTUALLY CAN

03:10:51.439 --> 03:10:53.809
HAVE MARKET MECHANISM LIKE-

03:10:53.875 --> 03:10:56.211
ATTRIBUTES I THINK CALIFORNIA IS

03:10:56.278 --> 03:10:59.014
BLOWN APART THE AYE THE SORT OF

03:10:59.080 --> 03:11:02.284
FALSE BINARY. COMMANDED CONTROL

03:11:02.350 --> 03:11:05.253
VERSES MARKETS. THE DICHOTOMY IF

03:11:05.320 --> 03:11:06.988
YOU WILL SO YOU KNOW IN THE LOW

03:11:07.055 --> 03:11:08.757
CARBON FUEL STANDARD WE HAVE A

03:11:08.824 --> 03:11:10.392
TRADING MECHANISM WITH MANY OF

03:11:10.458 --> 03:11:13.595
OUR- MANY OF OUR- OUR SECTOR

03:11:13.662 --> 03:11:16.765
POLICIES HAVE UP. FLEXIBILITY

03:11:16.832 --> 03:11:19.734
THAT ALLOWS A LEAST COST OF

03:11:19.801 --> 03:11:23.171
SOLUTIONS SO- I THINK YOU KNOW

03:11:23.238 --> 03:11:25.941
THE OF INDUSTRIAL. STANDARD FOR

03:11:26.007 --> 03:11:28.076
HEAT OF SUMMER DEAR COOK- CEMENT

03:11:28.143 --> 03:11:32.547
POLICY. IS THE DIRECTION I'D BE

03:11:32.614 --> 03:11:35.283
MORE INCLINED TO GO OTHERWISE-

03:11:35.350 --> 03:11:36.918
YOU KNOW IT'S ADJUSTMENTS EITHER

03:11:36.985 --> 03:11:38.220
ADJUSTMENTS TO THE SUPPLIER

03:11:38.286 --> 03:11:40.355
ALLOWANCES TO CORRECT FOR THE

03:11:40.422 --> 03:11:41.790
BANK ALLOWANCES AS THEY'VE

03:11:41.857 --> 03:11:43.625
THEY'VE BEEN DOING IN THE- OF

03:11:43.692 --> 03:11:45.093
THE E. U. WITH THEIR MARKET

03:11:45.160 --> 03:11:46.261
STABILITY RESERVE IS A

03:11:46.328 --> 03:11:47.963
CORRECTION FOR EARLY OVER SUPPLY

03:11:48.029 --> 03:11:49.998
AND ALSO IN THE- RED YOU PROGRAM

03:11:50.065 --> 03:11:51.800
IN THE NORTHEAST THE REGIONAL

03:11:51.867 --> 03:11:53.668
GREENHOUSE GAS INITIATIVE THEY-

03:11:53.735 --> 03:11:56.371
ESSENTIALLY DID A CORRECTION TO

03:11:56.438 --> 03:11:57.539
ACCOUNT FOR THE AMOUNT OF THE

03:11:57.606 --> 03:11:59.074
BANK IN THE INITIAL. FACE SO

03:11:59.140 --> 03:12:00.976
EITHER THAT OR OR SOME SORT OF

03:12:01.042 --> 03:12:03.144
ADJUSTMENT TO THE PRICE COLLAR.

03:12:03.211 --> 03:12:05.280
MISLI I SUGGESTED PERHAPS

03:12:05.347 --> 03:12:06.882
LINKING THE FLOOR TO WHETHER OR

03:12:06.948 --> 03:12:08.316
NOT WE'RE ON TRACK WITH OUR

03:12:08.383 --> 03:12:10.619
OVERALL GOAL GOAL SO IF WE'RE ON

03:12:10.685 --> 03:12:13.021
TRACK WE DON'T HAVE TO HAVE A

03:12:13.088 --> 03:12:14.823
CARBON PRICE GO UP MORE QUICKLY

03:12:14.890 --> 03:12:17.125
BUT IF WE'RE NOT ON TRACK AND WE

03:12:17.192 --> 03:12:18.793
WANT TO RELY ON THE CAP AND

03:12:18.860 --> 03:12:20.528
TRADE PROGRAM AS A BACKSTOP AS-

03:12:20.595 --> 03:12:21.463
CURRENT STRATEGY DOES THAT IT

03:12:21.529 --> 03:12:24.399
SHOULD BE MORE DIRECTLY LINKED.

03:12:24.466 --> 03:12:25.634
TO WHETHER OR NOT WE'RE ON TRACK

03:12:25.700 --> 03:12:27.035
OVERALL. RIGHT WELL THANK YOU

THE READY MARKET IN THE EUROPEAN

03:12:31.072 --> 03:12:32.974
MARKET THAT HAD DONE COURSE

03:12:33.041 --> 03:12:33.775
CORRECTIONS. TO ADDRESS THIS

03:12:33.842 --> 03:12:34.809
OVERSUPPLY ISSUE THAT WE ALSO

03:12:34.876 --> 03:12:37.045
HAVE- THANK YOU FOR THAT AND

LASTLY JUST. APPRECIATE THIS

03:12:38.546 --> 03:12:39.581
BECAUSE TALK ABOUT TRANSMISSION

03:12:39.648 --> 03:12:40.815
AND MY COLLEAGUES FOR BRINGING

03:12:40.882 --> 03:12:42.584
THAT UP I. I DO BELIEVE IT'S

03:12:42.651 --> 03:12:45.553
ACTUALLY IMPERATIVE THAT WE-

03:12:45.620 --> 03:12:46.554
MAKE PROGRESS ON TRANSMISSION

03:12:46.621 --> 03:12:49.024
THIS YEAR. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU

03:12:49.090 --> 03:12:59.701
VERY MUCH- ANY OTHER QUESTIONS.

APPRECIATE TO SO- MAYBE IF WE

03:13:17.385 --> 03:13:24.659
CAN. GO BACK TO. THE. THE

03:13:24.726 --> 03:13:25.760
NATIONAL PICTURE THAT THAT YOU

03:13:25.827 --> 03:13:28.763
HAD TO. PRESENTED WITH YOUR YOUR

03:13:28.830 --> 03:13:37.973
REPORT- CAN YOU TALK ABOUT THE-

03:13:38.039 --> 03:13:40.442
YOU KNOW WE WE'VE WE'VE HEARD A

03:13:40.508 --> 03:13:42.277
LOT OF CALLS IN AND CALIFORNIA

03:13:42.344 --> 03:13:44.045
WEEK YOU KNOW IN CALIFORNIA WE

03:13:44.112 --> 03:13:46.214
LIKE TO THINK OURSELVES IS AS

03:13:46.281 --> 03:13:47.215
LEADING AND THE FIGHT AGAINST

03:13:47.282 --> 03:13:49.651
CLIMATE CHANGE BUT YOU KNOW WE

03:13:49.718 --> 03:13:51.619
ARE SHARING THESE REMINDERS THAT

03:13:51.686 --> 03:13:53.521
WE MAY NOT BE ON TRACK WITH THE

03:13:53.588 --> 03:13:56.157
THESE THESE GOALS THAT WITH

03:13:56.224 --> 03:13:57.192
THEIR THAT WE'VE SET FOR

03:13:57.258 --> 03:14:01.596
OURSELVES. MMHM WHAT. WHAT ARE

03:14:01.663 --> 03:14:02.964
THE OPPORTUNITIES AND TRADE OFFS

03:14:03.031 --> 03:14:04.499
OF PLANNING PLANNING FOR CARBON

03:14:04.566 --> 03:14:07.335
NEUTRALITY BY TWENTY THIRTY FIVE

03:14:07.402 --> 03:14:12.007
VERSUS TWENTY FORTY FIVE. SO I

03:14:12.073 --> 03:14:13.842
SHOULD BE CLEAR THAT WE MODEL

03:14:13.908 --> 03:14:18.346
THE- TO US BUT NET ZERO BY

03:14:18.413 --> 03:14:19.514
TWENTY FIFTY AND THAT WAS US

03:14:19.581 --> 03:14:22.517
WIDE RIGHT SO THERE'S ALSO KIND

03:14:22.584 --> 03:14:24.119
OF. WITHIN THAT FRAMEWORK

03:14:24.185 --> 03:14:26.287
FLEXIBILITY OF WHERE THINGS ARE

03:14:26.354 --> 03:14:27.956
CITED SO TO ME THAT TARGETS NOT

03:14:28.023 --> 03:14:31.226
JUST CALIFORNIA ALONE IT'S- YOU

03:14:31.292 --> 03:14:32.427
COULD PREFERENTIALLY SITE THINGS

03:14:32.494 --> 03:14:35.663
WHERE THERE MIGHT BE ON- FEDERAL

03:14:35.730 --> 03:14:38.600
RESOURCES OR LOWER CONSTRAINTS

03:14:38.666 --> 03:14:40.869
WITH RESPECT TO TRANSMISSION ARE

03:14:40.935 --> 03:14:44.406
OR OR OTHERWISE. IT WITH RESPECT

03:14:44.472 --> 03:14:46.708
TO THOUGH. THOUGH BUILDING THE

03:14:46.775 --> 03:14:48.943
TARGET TO TWENTY THIRTY FIVE

03:14:49.010 --> 03:14:50.211
WHICH WE DID WE WERE NOT

03:14:50.278 --> 03:14:52.447
MODELING- BECAUSE WE'RE NOT

03:14:52.514 --> 03:14:54.883
MODELING STATE SPECIFIC POLICIES

03:14:54.949 --> 03:14:57.118
RATHER A FEDERAL POLICY. MANY OF

03:14:57.185 --> 03:14:59.087
THE SAME CONSTRAINTS ARISE AS

03:14:59.154 --> 03:15:01.089
THEY WOULD IN A TWENTY FIFTY

03:15:01.156 --> 03:15:02.891
EIGHT RIGHT SO TRANSMISSION RATE

03:15:02.957 --> 03:15:05.827
REMAINS A CONSTRAINT AS MANY OF.

03:15:05.894 --> 03:15:09.130
USTHAT ALREADY- AND THAT AGAIN

03:15:09.197 --> 03:15:10.498
IS A REGIONAL ISSUE NOT A

03:15:10.565 --> 03:15:12.734
CALIFORNIA ISSUE WE ALSO SAY

03:15:12.801 --> 03:15:14.436
WHEN WE'RE THINKING ABOUT

03:15:14.502 --> 03:15:16.171
SEQUENCING OF CRITICAL

03:15:16.237 --> 03:15:18.139
INFRASTRUCTURE IS ALSO IMPORTANT

03:15:18.206 --> 03:15:21.176
WHEN THINKING OF A NEAR TERM-

03:15:21.242 --> 03:15:24.112
BUT TARGET AND THAT IS NOT JUST

03:15:24.179 --> 03:15:26.815
RELATED TO TRANSMISSION AND

03:15:26.881 --> 03:15:29.918
RENEWABLES. THAT'S ALSO RELATED

03:15:29.984 --> 03:15:31.586
TO THINGS LIKE CARBON CAPTURE

03:15:31.653 --> 03:15:34.756
WHERE YOU NEED A CAR WITH. US

03:15:34.823 --> 03:15:38.860
YOU TO TRANSMISSION. BACKBONE

03:15:38.927 --> 03:15:40.095
TWO HUNDRED AND SUPPORT KIND OF

03:15:40.161 --> 03:15:42.263
RE POWERING THE FACILITIES OR

03:15:42.330 --> 03:15:44.165
CONVERSION OF FACILITIES WITH

03:15:44.232 --> 03:15:46.334
WITH CARBON CAPTURE AND ALSO SAY

03:15:46.401 --> 03:15:48.169
OTHER THINGS THAT HAVE TO OCCUR

03:15:48.236 --> 03:15:50.271
IN THAT SEQUENCE IS BUILDING UP

03:15:50.338 --> 03:15:51.706
APPROPRIATE MANUFACTURING

03:15:51.773 --> 03:15:54.109
CAPACITY TO SUPPORT KIND OF THE

03:15:54.175 --> 03:15:56.411
BUILD OUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

03:15:56.478 --> 03:15:58.179
OFFSHORE WIND IT'S NOT JUST

03:15:58.246 --> 03:16:00.215
FINDING KIND OF VIABLE SITES FOR

03:16:00.281 --> 03:16:03.084
OFFSHORE WIND OR HAVING- IT

03:16:03.151 --> 03:16:05.453
READILY GRADING CONNECTED IT'S

03:16:05.520 --> 03:16:07.755
ALSO HAVING THE MANUFACTURING

03:16:07.822 --> 03:16:10.992
CAPACITY TO- ASSEMBLE WENT

03:16:11.059 --> 03:16:13.228
URBAN. WHO ARE SHOWING A

03:16:13.294 --> 03:16:15.597
SPECIALLY OR WHEN AND LAN BASED

03:16:15.663 --> 03:16:17.565
WHEN MOST MANUFACTURING

03:16:17.632 --> 03:16:20.502
CURRENTLY- IN THE U. IN THE US

03:16:20.568 --> 03:16:23.238
MORE BROADLY IS DOMESTIC 80% OF

03:16:23.304 --> 03:16:25.306
OUR WIND TURBINES- THAT WE

03:16:25.373 --> 03:16:27.175
DEPLOY I'VE BEEN MANUFACTURING

03:16:27.242 --> 03:16:29.410
DOMESTICALLY JUST BECAUSE OF.

03:16:29.477 --> 03:16:30.745
THE THIS IS A LARGE

03:16:30.812 --> 03:16:31.913
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT YOU'RE

03:16:31.980 --> 03:16:40.054
BUILDING IT HAS TO BE PROXIMATE. TO WHERE YOU'RE DEPLOYING. SO

03:16:40.121 --> 03:16:42.190
THOSE ARE CRITICAL PIECES AT THE

03:16:42.257 --> 03:16:44.559
WELL THE FACT SIDE NOT APPLY ON

03:16:44.626 --> 03:16:45.927
. HER FIRST SOLO ALTHOUGH IT'S

03:16:45.994 --> 03:16:47.629
AND IT'S SITUATION GIVEN THAT

03:16:47.695 --> 03:16:49.230
KIND OF LOS OF OUR PRODUCTS ARE

03:16:49.297 --> 03:16:53.134
ARE- IN. A THIS CHAIN AND MOST

03:16:53.201 --> 03:16:56.838
OF THE CREDIT MATERIALS IS WELL

03:16:56.905 --> 03:17:01.376
. MMHM SO KIND OF NEAR TERM.

03:17:01.442 --> 03:17:04.212
TARGET OR EVEN OF A TWENTY FIFTY

03:17:04.279 --> 03:17:07.182
TARGET WHICH- WE WANT THESE ARE

03:17:07.248 --> 03:17:09.050
CONSTRAINTS THERE'S CAN OF THE

03:17:09.117 --> 03:17:12.720
GREAT OF THESE ROUTE OF THE SO

03:17:12.787 --> 03:17:20.295
CHAIN AND- I THINK. INTEREST. I

03:17:20.361 --> 03:17:23.998
NOTED THAT- THAT IN YOUR REPORT

03:17:24.065 --> 03:17:31.940
. YOU ALSO. OUR HIGHLIGHT. THE

03:17:32.006 --> 03:17:36.311
NEED FOR. AUG AND CARBON CAPTURE

03:17:36.377 --> 03:17:39.814
AND STORAGE OF. DID YOU HAVE ANY

03:17:39.881 --> 03:17:43.251
THOUGHTS IN TERMS OF. HOW YOU

03:17:43.318 --> 03:17:46.888
KNOW TO WHAT EXTENT. THE

03:17:46.955 --> 03:17:48.656
TECHNOLOGY BASED CARBON CAPTURE

03:17:48.723 --> 03:17:50.425
AND STORAGE IS GOING TO BE

03:17:50.491 --> 03:17:54.262
NECESSARY FOR ANY PATHWAY TO GET

03:17:54.329 --> 03:18:00.501
INTO CARBON NEUTRALITY. AS MANY

03:18:00.568 --> 03:18:02.403
OTHERS HAVE ALREADY SAID THAT IT

03:18:02.470 --> 03:18:04.572
IS ONE OF THE TOOLS WITHIN IN

03:18:04.639 --> 03:18:07.242
THE TOOLBOX- BUT OF COURSE THAT

03:18:07.308 --> 03:18:10.845
COMES WITH AND WE HAVE AN OF IT

03:18:10.912 --> 03:18:12.714
THAT DEMONSTRATED TECHNOLOGY BUT

03:18:12.780 --> 03:18:14.515
THERE'S ALSO ON THAT SIDE OF

03:18:14.582 --> 03:18:16.918
REGULATION AND ENSURING-

03:18:16.985 --> 03:18:17.885
APPROPRIATE MEASUREMENT

03:18:17.952 --> 03:18:19.554
MONITORING VERIFICATION

03:18:19.621 --> 03:18:20.888
PROTOCOLS RELATED TO THIS

03:18:20.955 --> 03:18:24.225
INFRASTRUCTURE. I WOULD ALSO SAY

03:18:24.292 --> 03:18:26.828
THAT WHEN YOU'RE TALKING MOST OF

03:18:26.894 --> 03:18:28.429
- OF THE CONVERSATION REGARDING

03:18:28.496 --> 03:18:30.131
CARBON CAPTURE IS RETIRING

03:18:30.198 --> 03:18:32.500
EXISTING FACILITIES AND WHERE

03:18:32.567 --> 03:18:34.535
THERE ALREADY EXISTS IN EQUITIES

03:18:34.602 --> 03:18:35.870
AND WHERE THOSE FACILITIES ARE

03:18:35.937 --> 03:18:38.640
CITED AND THE AIR POLLUTION AND

03:18:38.706 --> 03:18:41.142
OTHER IMPACTS. THAT ARE IN THE

03:18:41.209 --> 03:18:43.244
INCLUDING KIND OF HAZARDOUS

03:18:43.311 --> 03:18:46.881
WASTE- REMEDIATION FROM THOSE

03:18:46.948 --> 03:18:48.750
FACILITIES- THERE IS THE

03:18:48.816 --> 03:18:50.485
OPPORTUNITY TO REGARD THOSE

03:18:50.551 --> 03:18:52.353
FACILITIES TO REDUCE AIR QUALITY

03:18:52.420 --> 03:18:53.855
IMPACTS AND OTHER NEGATIVE

03:18:53.921 --> 03:18:56.024
IMPACTS WITHIN THOSE COMMUNITIES

PRIORITIZING THIS ISSUE IN THIS

03:27:59.633 --> 03:28:01.869
DISCUSSION. AND WANTED TO URGE.

03:28:01.936 --> 03:28:03.304
THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER THAT

03:28:03.370 --> 03:28:06.974
AS WE DEPLOY SOLUTION TO CUT OUR

03:28:07.041 --> 03:28:09.610
EMISSIONS WE NEED TO MAKE SURE

03:28:09.677 --> 03:28:10.878
THAT FOR REDUCING OUR RELIANCE

03:28:10.945 --> 03:28:12.146
ON FOSSIL FUELS AND THE

03:28:12.213 --> 03:28:14.748
POLLUTION THAT THAT IMPOSES. ON

03:28:14.815 --> 03:28:16.750
THE COMMUNITIES WHERE IT FRIDAY

03:28:16.817 --> 03:28:18.018
SO IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT WE'RE

03:28:18.085 --> 03:28:19.086
GONNA CENTER EQUITY WHEN IT

03:28:19.153 --> 03:28:20.888
DRAFTING THE CLIMATE CRISIS THAT

WE ARE PRIORITIZING POLICIES AND

03:28:22.489 --> 03:28:24.091
INVESTMENTS. THAT REDUCE

03:28:24.158 --> 03:28:26.627
EMISSIONS IN THE NEAR TERM AND

03:28:26.694 --> 03:28:28.696
ENSURE WOULD REDUCING POLLUTION

03:28:28.762 --> 03:28:30.030
BUT ECONOMY RESIDENTS ACROSS THE

03:28:30.097 --> 03:28:31.966
STATE. AND I WANT TO START THAT

03:28:32.032 --> 03:28:33.801
WHEN IT COMES TO CARBON CAPTURE

03:28:33.868 --> 03:28:36.270
AND STORAGE IT SHOULD BE STATED

03:28:36.337 --> 03:28:36.871
IN MANY CASES BUT NATURAL AND

03:28:36.937 --> 03:28:38.305
WORKING LANDS CARBON

03:28:38.372 --> 03:28:38.906
SEQUESTRATION IF TECHNICALLY

03:28:38.973 --> 03:28:39.974
MUCH CHEAPER TO IMPLEMENT. AND

03:28:40.040 --> 03:28:41.775
DIRECT AIR CAPTURE AND HOW THE

03:28:41.842 --> 03:28:43.611
MULTITUDE OF COKE BENEFITS NOT

03:28:43.677 --> 03:28:45.846
PROVIDED BY OTHER TECHNOLOGY NOT

03:28:45.913 --> 03:28:47.381
THE LEAST OF WHICH IS

03:28:47.448 --> 03:28:48.115
INTRODUCTION OF POLLUTION AND

03:28:48.182 --> 03:28:50.017
ENHANCEMENT OF AIR QUALITY

03:28:53.187 --> 03:28:54.255
SOLUTIONS THAT COULD CREATE HIGH

03:28:54.321 --> 03:28:55.322
QUALITY JOBS THROUGHOUT THE

INVESTMENTS IN RENEWABLE ENERGY

03:28:58.158 --> 03:28:59.860
PRODUCTION AND STORAGE BUT I

03:28:59.927 --> 03:29:01.528
WANT TO ADVOCATE FOR

RESOURCES THAN THOSE PROVEN

03:29:04.265 --> 03:29:07.001
SOLUTION EVEN IF IT MAY BE MORE

03:29:07.067 --> 03:29:08.769
EXPENSIVE AS- EXPENSIVE AS LONG

03:29:08.836 --> 03:29:10.537
AS IT REDUCES OUR DEPENDENCE ON

03:29:10.604 --> 03:29:11.839
FOSSIL FUEL AND PROTECT OUR

03:29:11.906 --> 03:29:19.346

VERY INTERESTING THERE'S BEEN

03:31:08.389 --> 03:31:09.390
SOME REALLY INTERESTING

DISCUSSION ABOUT MANY TOPICS BUT

03:31:10.624 --> 03:31:12.459
I'M VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE

GRASS BEING FOR TECHNOLOGICAL

03:31:13.994 --> 03:31:15.763

VALLEY HOWEVER THE LATEST IPCC

03:31:35.282 --> 03:31:37.017
REPORT CLIENTS THAT THESE

03:31:37.084 --> 03:31:38.552
TECHNOLOGIES COULD TRIGGER

CATASTROPHIC EVENTS IF YOU CAN

03:31:40.788 --> 03:31:42.189
BELIEVE IN VULNERABLE PARTS OF

03:31:42.256 --> 03:31:44.124
THE WORLD THEY WOULD INTRODUCE A

03:31:44.191 --> 03:31:46.460

03:32:08.615 --> 03:32:10.417
QUESTIONING THE SOCIAL AND

ENVIRONMENTAL FEASIBILITY I

03:32:11.952 --> 03:32:13.287
THOUGHT A LITTLE BIT

03:32:13.353 --> 03:32:13.887
DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS HEARING

03:32:13.954 --> 03:32:15.722
THAT THERE WAS NOT A MORE

03:32:15.789 --> 03:32:17.458
DIVERSITY OF VOICES ON THESE

03:32:17.524 --> 03:32:19.293
MATTERS AND THE LAST THING I

03:32:19.359 --> 03:32:20.294
WANT FLAG AS FAR AS

03:32:20.360 --> 03:32:21.762
DECARBONIZATION GOES HERE IN THE

03:32:21.829 --> 03:32:23.197
STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS THAT

03:32:23.263 --> 03:32:26.066
THERE IS A VERY STRONG AND VERY

03:32:26.133 --> 03:32:27.901
POLITICALLY SUPPORTED PIVOTAL

03:32:27.968 --> 03:32:29.536
LIQUID BIOFUELS HAPPENING IN THE

03:32:29.603 --> 03:32:31.004
SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA. AND

03:32:31.071 --> 03:32:32.439
WE'VE BEEN CAUSING A LOT OF

03:32:32.506 --> 03:32:34.641
EVIDENCE ABOUT DEPENDENT ON HIGH

03:32:37.644 --> 03:32:39.813
LIKE SOY AS A FEEDSTOCK FOR

03:32:39.880 --> 03:32:41.982
LIQUID BIOFUELS IS NOT THE KIND

03:32:42.049 --> 03:32:43.617
OF SOLUTION SO I REALLY THINK

03:32:43.684 --> 03:32:44.785
THAT THIS COMMITTEE NEEDS TO

03:32:44.852 --> 03:32:46.887
TAKE A STEP BACK AND TAKE A LOOK

03:32:46.954 --> 03:32:48.222
A HARD LOOK AT THE MECHANISMS

03:32:48.288 --> 03:32:49.923
THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN IN PLACE

03:32:49.990 --> 03:32:52.259
BEFORE GOING FURTHER DOWN THE
