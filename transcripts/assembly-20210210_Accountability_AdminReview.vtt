00:35:34.899 --> 00:35:36.534
DOSES. WE KNOW THESE NUMBERS

00:35:36.601 --> 00:35:38.035
ARE CORRECT BECAUSE WE HAVE

00:35:38.102 --> 00:35:39.637
PAPERWORK FOR EVERY DOSE

00:35:39.704 --> 00:35:42.206
ADMINISTERED. HOWEVER THE STATE

00:35:42.273 --> 00:35:43.541
IS CURRENTLY REPORTING THAT

00:35:43.608 --> 00:35:46.210
YOU'LL COUNTY HAS RECEIVED

00:35:46.277 --> 00:35:46.811
FOURTEEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED

DOSES ADMINISTERED JUST SEVENTY

00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:51.015
FIVE HUNDRED DOSES. NEITHER THE

00:35:51.082 --> 00:35:52.950

ADMINISTERED BEING REPORTED BY

00:35:54.619 --> 00:35:56.521
THE STATE MATCHES WHAT WE KNOW

00:35:56.587 --> 00:35:58.289
TO BE TRUE IN YOLO COUNTY WITH

00:35:58.356 --> 00:36:00.258
NEARLY 30% OF DOSES

00:36:00.324 --> 00:36:02.226
ADMINISTERED MISSING. YOLO

00:36:02.293 --> 00:36:03.461
COUNTY STAFF HAVE BEEN WORKING

00:36:03.528 --> 00:36:05.062
WITH THE STATE CONTRACTOR TO

00:36:05.129 --> 00:36:06.864
TROUBLESHOOT THE DISCREPANCIES

00:36:06.931 --> 00:36:09.333
TO NO AVAIL. I'M PARTICULARLY

00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:09.967
CONCERNED THAT THE

00:36:10.034 --> 00:36:11.969
DISCREPANCIES WILL RESULT IN

00:36:12.036 --> 00:36:14.005
REDUCED FUTURE ALLOCATIONS. IF

00:36:14.071 --> 00:36:16.207
THE STATE USES ITS CURRENT DATA

00:36:16.274 --> 00:36:17.909
TO DETERMINE FUTURE ALLOCATIONS

00:36:17.975 --> 00:36:19.744
YOLO COUNTY COULD BE PENALIZED

00:36:19.810 --> 00:36:21.245
FOR WHAT THE STATE SEES AS AN

00:36:21.312 --> 00:36:23.814
ADMINISTRATION RATE OF 51% BUT

00:36:23.881 --> 00:36:25.650
IT'S ACTUALLY AN ADMINISTRATION

00:36:25.716 --> 00:36:27.852
RATE OF SEVENTY FOUR PERCENT.

00:36:27.919 --> 00:36:28.920
IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT

00:36:28.986 --> 00:36:30.755
ALLOCATION DECISIONS BE BASED

00:36:30.821 --> 00:36:33.824
ON ACCURATE DATA RIGHT NOW CDPH

00:36:33.891 --> 00:36:35.493
DOES NOT HAVE ACCURATE DATA FOR

00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:38.496
YOLO COUNTY. A DECISION BASED A

00:36:38.563 --> 00:36:42.500
DECISION BASED ON BAD DATA WILL

00:36:42.567 --> 00:36:43.634
BE A BAD DECISION. CALIFORNIA'S

00:36:43.701 --> 00:36:46.070
VACCINE ROLLOUT IS HAMSTRUNG BY

00:36:46.137 --> 00:36:47.805
POOR DATA QUALITY AT THE STATE

00:36:47.872 --> 00:36:50.241
LEVEL AND ITS EMPHASIS ON SPEED

00:36:50.308 --> 00:36:52.777
HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BENEFIT

00:36:52.843 --> 00:36:53.377
THE PRIVILEGED MORE THAN THE

00:36:53.444 --> 00:36:55.947
UNDERSERVED. WELL I DISAGREE

00:36:56.013 --> 00:36:57.081
WITH THE DECISION TO BRING IN A

00:36:57.148 --> 00:36:58.683
THIRD PARTY ADMINISTRATOR WITH

00:36:58.749 --> 00:36:59.951
NO EXPERIENCE IN VACCINE

00:37:00.017 --> 00:37:01.919
ALLOCATION NOW THAT THE STATE

00:37:01.986 --> 00:37:03.654
HAS COMMITTED TO THIS CHANGE IT

00:37:03.721 --> 00:37:05.423
IS CRITICAL THAT DATA TRACKING

00:37:05.489 --> 00:37:07.358
BE IMPROVED BY ELIMINATING THE

00:37:07.425 --> 00:37:09.827

00:37:09.894 --> 00:37:11.896
THE CURRENT CARE TO SYSTEM. IN

00:37:11.963 --> 00:37:13.564

PHASE ONE B. TIER ONE.

00:38:55.132 --> 00:38:56.400
DECISIONS ABOUT VACCINE

00:38:56.467 --> 00:38:58.669
PRIORITIZATION MUST BE ROOTED

00:38:58.736 --> 00:39:01.038
IN SCIENCE AND INSULATED FROM

00:39:01.105 --> 00:39:03.808
POLITICAL PRESSURES. THE

00:39:05.910 --> 00:39:07.845
FASTER THAN STATE DATA SUGGEST

00:39:07.912 --> 00:39:08.813
LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS ARE

00:39:08.879 --> 00:39:11.082
PUTTING DOSES INTO ARMS AS

QUICKLY AS WE RECEIVE THEM

00:39:13.084 --> 00:39:15.152
UNFORTUNATELY THE STATE DATA DO

00:39:15.219 --> 00:39:16.487
NOT REFLECT THE TREMENDOUS

SYSTEM TALKED ABOUT I'M NOT

00:41:46.470 --> 00:41:47.571
CONFIDENT AT ALL OF THAT IS

00:41:47.638 --> 00:41:50.641
REFLECTED IN IN THE STATE- DATA

00:41:50.708 --> 00:41:53.344
SYSTEMS. WE HAVE MORE THAN

00:41:53.410 --> 00:41:53.844
THREE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE

00:41:53.911 --> 00:41:54.845
VACCINATION SITES ACROSS THE

00:41:54.912 --> 00:41:56.413
COUNTY INCLUDING SIX LARGE

00:41:56.480 --> 00:41:58.215
COMMUNITY VACCINATION SITES AND

00:41:58.282 --> 00:41:59.950
A LARGE NETWORK OF HOSPITALS.

00:42:00.017 --> 00:42:01.085
COMMUNITY CLINICS FEDERALLY

00:42:01.151 --> 00:42:03.554
QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTERS

00:42:03.621 --> 00:42:04.121
PHARMACIES AND MANY PRIVATE

00:42:04.188 --> 00:42:06.223
PROVIDERS. UNFORTUNATELY THE

00:42:06.290 --> 00:42:07.958
BIGGEST ISSUE WE CONTINUE TO

00:42:08.025 --> 00:42:09.593
FACE. IS THE SCARCITY OF

00:42:09.660 --> 00:42:11.762
VACCINE SUPPLY AND VERY ABILITY

00:42:11.829 --> 00:42:12.997
IN THE AMOUNT OF VACCINE WE

00:42:13.063 --> 00:42:14.899
RECEIVED FROM WEEK TO WEEK.

00:42:14.965 --> 00:42:16.467
WHILE THE SUPPLY WE RECEIVED

00:42:16.533 --> 00:42:17.835
OVER THE PAST SEVERAL WEEKS HAS

00:42:17.902 --> 00:42:19.904
SLIGHTLY INCREASED. IT REMAINS

00:42:19.970 --> 00:42:21.338
FAR SHORT OF THE NEED GIVEN

00:42:21.405 --> 00:42:23.540
THAT NEARLY TWO MILLION COUNTY

00:42:23.607 --> 00:42:24.174
RESIDENTS ARE CURRENTLY

00:42:24.241 --> 00:42:26.577
ELIGIBLE. TO RECEIVE VACCINE

00:42:26.644 --> 00:42:29.980

EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION OF THE

VACCINE. WE ARE GREATLY

00:42:38.422 --> 00:42:39.890
CONCERNED ABOUT CONDITIONS IN

00:42:39.957 --> 00:42:40.891
WHICH PEOPLE WITH FEWER

00:42:40.958 --> 00:42:42.793
RESOURCES HAVE LESS ACCESS TO

00:42:42.860 --> 00:42:44.728
THE VACCINE. EITHER BECAUSE OF

00:42:44.795 --> 00:42:46.430
LIMITED ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGY

00:42:46.497 --> 00:42:48.532

IN OUR COUNTY. THESE EARLY

00:43:18.629 --> 00:43:20.331
RESULTS ARE EXTREMELY ALARMING

00:43:20.397 --> 00:43:21.198
AND INDICATE THAT WE NEED TO

00:43:21.265 --> 00:43:22.967
MAKE IT MUCH EASIER FOR BLACK

00:43:23.033 --> 00:43:24.368

DISCUSSION I JUST HAVE ONE

00:46:37.961 --> 00:46:39.062
QUICK QUESTION WHEN ASKED WE'RE

00:46:39.129 --> 00:46:40.430
TALKING A LOT ABOUT EQUITY

00:46:40.497 --> 00:46:43.000
SEEMS A BIG. ISSUE DAILY THAT

00:46:43.066 --> 00:46:44.334
THERE WERE WILL BE TALKED ABOUT

00:46:44.401 --> 00:46:45.969
HERE AND THE LEGISLATURE IN OUR

00:46:46.036 --> 00:46:47.938
COMMUNITIES IS THERE A WAY HOW

00:46:48.005 --> 00:46:49.006
IN OUR LOCAL LEVELS WERE

00:46:49.072 --> 00:46:52.176
MEASURING SUCCESSES PROVIDING

00:46:52.242 --> 00:46:52.676
BOXING STAR UNDERSERVED

00:46:52.743 --> 00:46:57.347
COMMUNITIES. WELL I WILL SAY

00:46:57.414 --> 00:46:58.615
AGAIN THIS REQUIRES ACCURATE

00:46:58.682 --> 00:47:00.217
DATA WE THERE'S A GREAT

00:47:00.284 --> 00:47:02.352
INTEREST IN UNDERSTANDING WHAT.

00:47:02.419 --> 00:47:03.654
WHAT THE LANDSCAPE LOOKS LIKE

00:47:03.720 --> 00:47:05.789
HERE AND WE ARE STRUGGLING.

00:47:05.856 --> 00:47:07.024
WITH THE DATA THEY MENTION WE

00:47:07.090 --> 00:47:08.725
DID AN INITIAL ANALYSIS LOOKING

00:47:08.792 --> 00:47:11.628
AT. HOWEVER PRESENTED. OUR

00:47:11.695 --> 00:47:13.130
RACIAL AND ETHNIC GROUPS ARE

00:47:13.197 --> 00:47:14.765
AMONG THOSE VACCINATED AND

00:47:14.831 --> 00:47:16.600
FOUND THAT CERTAIN GROUPS ARE

00:47:16.667 --> 00:47:18.468
UNDERREPRESENTED BUT- THE RACE

00:47:18.535 --> 00:47:20.037
AND ETHNICITY DATA IS NOT

00:47:20.103 --> 00:47:22.539
PARTICULARLY COMPLETE. IN THE

00:47:22.606 --> 00:47:26.176
CARE SYSTEM. AND IN ADDITION

00:47:26.243 --> 00:47:28.612
THERE ARE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT

00:47:28.679 --> 00:47:32.950
ACCURACY IS AS WELL. THIS IS

00:47:33.016 --> 00:47:34.818
DOCTOR SAYS IT ALL ECHO WHAT

00:47:34.885 --> 00:47:36.119
WHAT DOCTOR PAUL L. A. COUNTY

00:47:36.186 --> 00:47:39.056
SAID- WE DID INITIAL ANALYSIS

00:47:39.122 --> 00:47:40.190
OF THOSE VACCINATED AND YOU'LL

00:47:40.257 --> 00:47:41.658
COUNTY SO FAR BY RACE AND

00:47:41.725 --> 00:47:43.660
ETHNICITY AND WE'VE SEEN THAT

00:47:43.727 --> 00:47:45.462
ONLY ABOUT 15% OF THOSE WHO

00:47:45.529 --> 00:47:46.863
HAVE BEEN VACCINATED ARE

00:47:46.930 --> 00:47:48.398
HISPANIC OR LATINO YET THEY

00:47:48.465 --> 00:47:50.167
REPRESENT 32% OF OUR

00:47:50.234 --> 00:47:52.803
POPULATION- BUT APPROXIMATELY A

00:47:52.869 --> 00:47:54.338
THIRD OF PEOPLE WHO'VE

00:47:54.404 --> 00:47:56.340
EXACERBATED THERE IS NO DATA.

00:47:56.406 --> 00:47:58.141
ON THEIR RACE OR ETHNICITY SO

00:47:58.208 --> 00:48:00.344
THAT THE DATA IS INCOMPLETE AND

00:48:00.410 --> 00:48:02.212
THEN WE ALSO KNOW THAT THAT

00:48:02.279 --> 00:48:03.347
SOME OF THE DATA. SOME OF THE

00:48:03.413 --> 00:48:03.814
DOSES THAT HAVE BEEN

00:48:03.880 --> 00:48:05.282
ADMINISTERED AREN'T SHOWING UP

00:48:05.349 --> 00:48:07.050
AT ALL IN THE IMMUNIZATION

00:48:07.117 --> 00:48:08.952
REGISTRY WHERE WERE PULLING UP

00:48:09.019 --> 00:48:10.887
RACE AND ETHNICITY DATA FROM.

00:48:10.954 --> 00:48:12.356
ON THE BACK AND SO I THINK

00:48:12.422 --> 00:48:13.523
THERE'S WE HAVE SEVERAL

00:48:13.590 --> 00:48:15.592
CONCERNS ABOUT THE QUALITY OF

00:48:15.659 --> 00:48:17.327
THE DATA THAT WE'RE USING TO

00:48:17.394 --> 00:48:19.496
DETERMINE. THE EQUITY OF OUR

00:48:19.563 --> 00:48:23.000
VACCINE ROLLOUT. OKAY THANK YOU

00:48:23.066 --> 00:48:24.534
SO ANY. MEMBERS OF THE

00:48:24.601 --> 00:48:26.169
COMMITTEE HAD A QUESTION. A

00:48:26.236 --> 00:48:27.971
QUESTION OF VICE CHAIR KELLY

EACH OF YOU HAVE THE MAXIMUM

00:48:35.445 --> 00:48:38.248
NUMBER OF THEIR DISTRIBUTION

00:48:38.315 --> 00:48:40.317
CAPABILITY FOR YOUR COUNTY.

00:48:40.384 --> 00:48:41.985
VETERANS HOW MANY HOW MANY

00:48:42.052 --> 00:48:47.224
DOSES CAN YOU GIVE A WEEK. SO

00:48:47.291 --> 00:48:49.426
IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY IDEALLY

00:48:49.493 --> 00:48:51.361
WE'D LIKE TO SEE UPWARDS OF

00:48:51.428 --> 00:48:53.764
ABOUT A HALF A MILLION. DOSES A

00:48:53.830 --> 00:48:55.899
WEEK. THAT MAY SOUND LIKE AN

00:48:55.966 --> 00:48:57.034
AWFUL LOT BUT WE HAVE TEN

00:48:57.100 --> 00:48:58.635
MILLION PEOPLE IN THE COUNTY

00:48:58.702 --> 00:49:01.004
AND EIGHT MILLION ADULTS. AND

00:49:01.071 --> 00:49:03.340
DIFFICULT HOLLISTER VACCINATE

00:49:03.407 --> 00:49:06.143
75% OF THEM WITHIN A- SIX MONTH

00:49:06.209 --> 00:49:08.879
PERIOD WE NEED ABOUT FIVE

00:49:08.945 --> 00:49:10.447
HUNDRED THOUSAND DOSES A WEEK

00:49:10.514 --> 00:49:12.983
RIGHT AND WE HAVE A VERY ROBUST

00:49:13.050 --> 00:49:14.184
NETWORK OF PROVIDERS AND I

00:49:14.251 --> 00:49:15.519
THINK WE COULD BARELY VERY

00:49:15.585 --> 00:49:17.954
QUICKLY RAMP UP. TO THAT LEVEL

00:49:18.021 --> 00:49:21.458
THE VACCINATION- IF WE HAVE

00:49:21.525 --> 00:49:22.959
SUFFICIENT SUPPLY. SORRY DO YOU

00:49:23.026 --> 00:49:25.262
HAVE THE CAPABILITY TO DELIVER

00:49:25.329 --> 00:49:27.631
THAT FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND IF

00:49:27.698 --> 00:49:30.434
YOU IF YOU WERE ABLE TO GET. WE

00:49:30.500 --> 00:49:33.704
DO WE DO OKAY I WILL SAY THOUGH

00:49:33.770 --> 00:49:35.072
THAT I HAVE NO CONCERNS ABOUT

00:49:35.138 --> 00:49:36.673
THE VALUE MY BIGGER CONCERN IS

00:49:36.740 --> 00:49:38.308
MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE ABLE TO

00:49:38.375 --> 00:49:39.910
REACH THOSE POPULATIONS THAT

00:49:39.976 --> 00:49:41.845
MAY BE HESITANT. TO BE

00:49:41.912 --> 00:49:43.213
VACCINATED OR FOR WHATEVER

00:49:43.280 --> 00:49:45.015
REASON HAVE DIFFICULTY

00:49:45.082 --> 00:49:47.117
ACCESSING NEEDED SERVICES SO I

00:49:47.184 --> 00:49:48.985
THINK WE HAVE TO SACRIFICE.

00:49:49.052 --> 00:49:52.422
SACRIFICE VOLUME IN SOME CASES

00:49:52.489 --> 00:49:54.391
TO TRY TO REACH THOSE. ARE

00:49:54.458 --> 00:49:56.226
GROUPS THAT HISTORICALLY OF THE

00:49:56.293 --> 00:49:58.395
HAVE- NOT BEEN ADEQUATELY

00:49:58.462 --> 00:49:59.996
SERVED THAT WAS GONNA BE A

00:50:00.063 --> 00:50:01.531
FOLLOW UP QUESTION FOR ME FROM

00:50:01.598 --> 00:50:05.102
YOLO COUNTY CAN I HEAR YOUR

00:50:05.168 --> 00:50:06.770
MAXIMUM CAPABILITY PER WEEK.

00:50:06.837 --> 00:50:08.238
YEAH I THINK IT WOULD BE

00:50:08.305 --> 00:50:11.241
SOMEWHERE AROUND TEN THOUSAND A

00:50:11.308 --> 00:50:12.175
WHICH WOULD HAVE A SAID

00:50:12.242 --> 00:50:14.845
MINISTERING ABOUT FOURTEEN

00:50:14.911 --> 00:50:16.380
HUNDRED DOSES A DAY. WE CAN

00:50:16.446 --> 00:50:18.915
EASILY DO A THOUSAND DOSES A

00:50:18.982 --> 00:50:20.550
DAY AND NIGHT IN A DRIVE

00:50:20.617 --> 00:50:21.918
THROUGH CLINIC AND WE'VE WE'VE

00:50:21.985 --> 00:50:24.354
DONE. MULTIPLE OCCASIONS SO I

00:50:24.421 --> 00:50:26.156
THINK GETTING TO TEN THOUSAND

00:50:26.223 --> 00:50:28.592
IN A WEEK OUR WOULD BE WOULD BE

00:50:28.658 --> 00:50:30.761
DOABLE AND THAT BY COMPARISON

00:50:30.827 --> 00:50:32.863
WERE WE GOT TWO THOUSAND THIS

00:50:32.929 --> 00:50:34.531
WEEK SO WE COULD DO AT LEAST

00:50:34.598 --> 00:50:35.365
FIVE TIMES WHAT WE'RE CURRENTLY

00:50:35.432 --> 00:50:37.367
RECEIVING. OKAY THANK YOU AND

00:50:37.434 --> 00:50:40.404
THEN. ON TO THE SECOND QUESTION

00:50:40.470 --> 00:50:42.639
ABOUT THE DISTRIBUTION INTO.

00:50:42.706 --> 00:50:44.374
AREAS WHERE WE ARE INTO

00:50:44.441 --> 00:50:45.742
MINORITY COMMUNITIES WHERE WE

00:50:45.809 --> 00:50:48.812
MAY NOT BE GETTING- DID THE-

00:50:48.879 --> 00:50:50.747
COOPERATION WE WOULD LIKE TO BE

00:50:50.814 --> 00:50:52.582
ABLE TO GET PEOPLE. DO WE KNOW

00:50:52.649 --> 00:50:56.052
WHY- THIS IS IT ACCESS IS IT

00:50:56.119 --> 00:50:58.555
INFORMATION OR IS IT HESITANCY

00:50:58.622 --> 00:51:02.659
ON THEIR PART. BECAUSE OF. VS

00:51:02.726 --> 00:51:06.129
NOTIONS THAT- R. FX AND THEY'VE

00:51:06.196 --> 00:51:07.464
HAD WITH OUR EFFORTS TO THEY'VE

00:51:07.531 --> 00:51:09.232
HAD WITH THE VACCINES ARE THEY

00:51:09.299 --> 00:51:11.835
AFRAID TO GET IT OR THEY JUST

00:51:11.902 --> 00:51:15.705
DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO GET. WELL

00:51:15.772 --> 00:51:17.107
I GUESS I'LL START I THINK IT'S

00:51:17.174 --> 00:51:19.342
A COMBINATION OF THOSE FACTORS

00:51:19.409 --> 00:51:21.511
YOU'VE MENTIONED I THINK THERE.

00:51:21.578 --> 00:51:23.380
YOU KNOW THEY'RE AFRAID BUT BUT

00:51:23.447 --> 00:51:24.548
IT'S MORE COMPLEX THAN THAT IN

00:51:24.614 --> 00:51:26.116
SOME CASES IT'S ALSO JUST A

00:51:26.183 --> 00:51:28.485
GENERAL LACK OF TRUST GIVEN.

00:51:28.552 --> 00:51:31.054
RIGHT HISTORICAL EXPERIENCES OF

00:51:31.121 --> 00:51:33.290
GROUPS OR YOU KNOW EXPERIENCE

00:51:33.356 --> 00:51:34.658
OF EXPERIENCES HAVE GIVEN

00:51:34.724 --> 00:51:36.526
INDIVIDUALS IN IN OUR SYSTEMS

00:51:36.593 --> 00:51:38.195
OF CARE. THEY'RE JUST AS A

00:51:38.261 --> 00:51:41.665
GENERAL LACK OF TRUST. AND-

00:51:41.731 --> 00:51:42.999
SOME DOUBT AS TO WHETHER THE

00:51:43.066 --> 00:51:45.235
VACCINES ARE SAFE AND REALLY

00:51:45.302 --> 00:51:47.137
WORK. BUT IN ADDITION THERE IS

00:51:47.204 --> 00:51:48.438
NO QUESTION THAT WE'RE SEEING

00:51:48.505 --> 00:51:50.907
CHALLENGES. AMONG SOME GROUPS

00:51:50.974 --> 00:51:53.743
AND NAVIGATING OUR SYSTEM IS.

00:51:53.810 --> 00:51:56.146
HIM TO WRAP UP VOLUME L. A.

00:51:56.213 --> 00:51:57.781
COUNTY WE'VE WE'VE OPENS-

00:51:57.848 --> 00:52:00.817
STICKS VERY LARGE POTS POINTS

00:52:00.884 --> 00:52:03.186
OF DISPENSING. AND THAT'S BEEN

00:52:03.253 --> 00:52:05.021
VERY SUCCESSFUL IN GETTING MORE

00:52:05.088 --> 00:52:06.356
VACCINE IN PEOPLE'S ARMS BUT IT

00:52:06.423 --> 00:52:09.526
HAPPENED. ADDRESSING THE EQUITY

00:52:09.593 --> 00:52:11.661
ISSUE THAT THOSE GROUPS THAT.

00:52:11.728 --> 00:52:13.663
YOU KNOW MAY MOST NEED VACCINE

00:52:13.730 --> 00:52:16.633
ARE ALWAYS WELL SERVED BY THESE

00:52:16.700 --> 00:52:18.635
LARGE POTS PARTICULARLY SENIORS.

00:52:18.702 --> 00:52:21.271
BUT ALSO- RACIAL AND ETHNIC

00:52:21.338 --> 00:52:23.240
GROUPS I THINK. THE BEST

00:52:23.306 --> 00:52:24.841
SUCCESS WILL BE SEEN IF WE'RE

00:52:24.908 --> 00:52:26.409
ABLE TO PROVIDE VACCINE TO

00:52:26.476 --> 00:52:28.879
TRUSTED PROVIDERS WITHIN THEIR

00:52:28.945 --> 00:52:32.315
COMMUNITIES CLINICS AND ALSO

00:52:32.382 --> 00:52:37.587
PHARMACY'S- AS WELL. AND YOUR.

00:52:37.654 --> 00:52:40.724
YEAH I AGREE WITH WHAT. DR PAUL

00:52:40.790 --> 00:52:42.893
HAS HAS SAID IN AN L. A. COUNTY

00:52:42.959 --> 00:52:43.593
I THINK THERE ARE SEVERAL

00:52:43.660 --> 00:52:45.395
FACTORS FOR WHY IT'S BEEN

00:52:45.462 --> 00:52:47.631
DIFFICULT TO REACH CERTAIN

00:52:47.697 --> 00:52:49.366
POPULATIONS AND SOME THAT ARE

00:52:49.432 --> 00:52:50.967
REALLY SPECIFIC TO THE FACT

00:52:51.034 --> 00:52:52.736
THAT IT'S THE OVER OR SIXTY

00:52:52.802 --> 00:52:54.704
FIVE AND OLDER POPULATION WHICH

00:52:54.771 --> 00:52:56.306
IN GENERAL TEND TO BE LESS

00:52:56.373 --> 00:52:58.174
CONNECTED THROUGH TECHNOLOGY

00:52:58.241 --> 00:53:00.377
AND- YOU KNOW COMPUTERS EMAIL

00:53:00.443 --> 00:53:02.979
TEXT MESSAGES OR SOCIAL MEDIA

00:53:03.046 --> 00:53:04.948
EASIEST WAY FASTEST WAY TO GET

00:53:05.015 --> 00:53:06.683
INFORMATION OUT BUT THAT IS NOT

00:53:06.750 --> 00:53:08.852
HOW WE ARE HAVING SUCCESS IN

00:53:08.919 --> 00:53:10.253
REACHING THE SIXTY FIVE AND

00:53:10.320 --> 00:53:12.455
OLDER COMMUNITY SELF. SO SLOWER

00:53:12.522 --> 00:53:14.457

00:55:33.263 --> 00:55:34.931
ELIGIBILITY FOR VACCINATION WAS

POINT THREE MILLION PEOPLE IN

00:55:40.170 --> 00:55:41.771
L. A. COUNTY. THE SYSTEM WAS

00:55:41.838 --> 00:55:44.908
JUST ABSOLUTELY OVERWHELMED AND-

00:55:44.974 --> 00:55:47.577
THAT'S WHY WE'VE I THINK ALSO

00:55:47.644 --> 00:55:51.948
DECIDED TO ROLL OUT A MORE-

00:55:52.015 --> 00:55:53.817

WORKING WITH HIGH RISK GROUPS

00:56:09.833 --> 00:56:10.834
AND THEN I THINK AS WE

00:56:10.900 --> 00:56:13.069
TRANSITION INCREASINGLY INTO

00:56:13.136 --> 00:56:14.204
THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM.

00:56:14.270 --> 00:56:16.039

GET. APPOINTMENTS HOPEFULLY

00:56:20.443 --> 00:56:23.446

I DON'T KNOW. YOU KNOW IT'S

00:57:05.021 --> 00:57:06.022
PRETTY OBVIOUS THAT THERE'S

00:57:06.089 --> 00:57:07.991
MANY SYSTEMS THAT WE WERE ALL

00:57:08.057 --> 00:57:10.693
WORKING WITH AND- OBVIOUSLY

00:57:10.760 --> 00:57:13.396
SOUNDS VERY VERY COMPLICATED-

00:57:13.463 --> 00:57:13.963
BUT WE'RE JUST WONDERING HOW

00:57:14.030 --> 00:57:18.268
CAN WE HELP YOU. YOUR DOCTOR

00:57:18.334 --> 00:57:20.136
SAYS AND ALL ALL THE- TIME AND-

00:57:20.203 --> 00:57:21.704
I THINK THERE'S A THERE'S A FEW

00:57:21.771 --> 00:57:23.873
CHALLENGES- SOME HAVE TO DEAL

00:57:23.940 --> 00:57:25.708
WITH JUST A LARGE NUMBER OF

00:57:25.775 --> 00:57:27.277
PROVIDERS IN THE VARIOUS

00:57:27.343 --> 00:57:28.945
SYSTEMS IN WHICH DATA ARE BEING

00:57:29.012 --> 00:57:31.614
IMPORTED AND SO- THERE AT THAT

00:57:31.681 --> 00:57:32.916
THE STATE IS CURRENTLY DEALING

00:57:32.982 --> 00:57:35.018
WITH A LOT OF ON MATCH DATA-

00:57:35.084 --> 00:57:35.919
WHERE THEY HAVE SOME

00:57:35.985 --> 00:57:37.153
INFORMATION BUT NOT ENOUGH

00:57:37.220 --> 00:57:38.988
INFORMATION TO LINK THOSE DOSES

00:57:39.055 --> 00:57:40.223
TO THE RIGHT PROVIDER IN THE

00:57:40.290 --> 00:57:41.558
RIGHT COUNTY SO THEY'RE SHOWING

00:57:41.624 --> 00:57:44.828
UP- AS- UNACCOUNTED FOR. BUT

00:57:44.894 --> 00:57:46.963
THERE ARE AN ON MATCHED BUT

00:57:47.030 --> 00:57:48.798
THERE'S ALSO SOME DOSES THAT

00:57:48.865 --> 00:57:50.500
WE'RE SEEING IN IN YOLO COUNTY

00:57:50.567 --> 00:57:52.836
THE 30% OF DOES IS THAT I

00:57:52.902 --> 00:57:54.070
MENTIONED ARE MISSING FROM OUR

00:57:54.137 --> 00:57:56.105
DATA. THEY'RE NOT ON MATCH THEY

00:57:56.172 --> 00:57:57.874
JUST AREN'T SHOWING UP AT ALL

00:57:57.941 --> 00:57:59.008
AND WE THINK THAT IT HAS%

00:57:59.075 --> 00:58:02.445
SOMETHING TO DO WITH- SO. THE

00:58:02.512 --> 00:58:04.080
WIN THAT DATA IS UPLOADED ON

00:58:04.147 --> 00:58:05.348
THE BACK AND INTO THE

00:58:05.415 --> 00:58:06.783
IMMUNIZATION REGISTRY THAT EVEN

00:58:06.850 --> 00:58:07.584
THOUGH WE RECEIVE A

00:58:07.650 --> 00:58:09.219
CONFIRMATION. THAT IT THE

00:58:09.285 --> 00:58:11.221
UPLOAD HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL BUT

00:58:11.287 --> 00:58:12.755
THAT SOMEHOW THAT DATA IS NOT

00:58:12.822 --> 00:58:14.224
SHOWING UP IN THE REGISTRY

00:58:14.290 --> 00:58:17.560
AFTER ALL. AND- IT SO I WOULD-

00:58:17.627 --> 00:58:19.229
I CAN'T SPEAK TO WHY THAT'S

00:58:19.295 --> 00:58:21.197
HAPPENING- BUT I DO THINK THAT

00:58:21.264 --> 00:58:22.498
THAT'S AN IMPORTANT PLACE FOR

00:58:22.565 --> 00:58:23.967
THE STATE TO WALK BECAUSE I'M-

00:58:24.033 --> 00:58:25.768
HEARING FROM MULTIPLE LOCAL

00:58:25.835 --> 00:58:27.604
HEALTH DEPARTMENTS. IN THE

00:58:27.670 --> 00:58:28.438
GENERAL IN THE GREATER

00:58:28.504 --> 00:58:30.006
SACRAMENTO REGION THAT THEY'RE

00:58:30.073 --> 00:58:32.041
EXPERIENCING THE SAME ISSUE

00:58:32.108 --> 00:58:35.845
WITH MISSING DOSES. YEAH THAT'S

00:58:35.912 --> 00:58:36.546
REALLY IMPORTANT POINT WHERE

00:58:36.613 --> 00:58:38.314
WE'RE WE'RE- SEEING THE SAME

00:58:38.381 --> 00:58:40.183
THING YOU'RE A LOS ANGELES

00:58:40.250 --> 00:58:42.018
COUNTY AND ARE CONCERNED. ON

00:58:42.085 --> 00:58:44.087
THE REGISTRATION SITE MIGHT

00:58:44.153 --> 00:58:46.923
TURN THEIR SOME FUNCTIONALITY.

00:58:46.990 --> 00:58:48.224
PETER IS THAT I THINK WOULD BE

00:58:48.291 --> 00:58:50.093
VERY VERY HELPFUL AND MAYBE THE

00:58:50.159 --> 00:58:51.427
STATE IS ALREADY WORKING ON

00:58:51.494 --> 00:58:53.129
THESE BUT FOR EXAMPLE WHEN

00:58:53.196 --> 00:58:55.531
SOMEONE GOES IN. TO TRY TO MAKE

00:58:55.598 --> 00:58:57.000
AN APPOINTMENT OR UNABLE TO DO

00:58:57.066 --> 00:59:00.303
SO IF THERE WAS- AND I'M A

00:59:00.370 --> 00:59:02.672
FUNCTION THAT WILL ALLOW THEM

00:59:02.739 --> 00:59:04.307
TO LEAVE THEIR- NAME AND

00:59:04.374 --> 00:59:05.842
WHATEVER OTHER INFORMATION IS

00:59:05.909 --> 00:59:08.044
NECESSARY SO THAT ONE OF THE

00:59:08.111 --> 00:59:08.544
APPOINTMENT DOES BECOME

00:59:08.611 --> 00:59:10.380

00:59:13.016 --> 00:59:14.617
IN OTHER WORDS SORT OF LIKE A

00:59:14.684 --> 00:59:17.086
WHIPPING WAITING LESS. AND IN

00:59:17.153 --> 00:59:18.688
ADDITION IF THERE WAS A WAY FOR

00:59:18.755 --> 00:59:23.526
FOLKS TO. PUT IN THE ZIP CODE.

00:59:23.593 --> 00:59:25.561

NOTIFIED OF AVAILABLE POINT

00:59:28.965 --> 00:59:30.366
APPOINTMENTS AT ANY SITES NEAR

00:59:30.433 --> 00:59:31.601
WHERE THEY LIVE THAT WOULD ALSO

00:59:31.668 --> 00:59:33.536
BE HELPFUL THESE ARE JUST A

00:59:33.603 --> 00:59:35.305
COUPLE OF EXAMPLES WE HEAR LOTS

00:59:35.371 --> 00:59:37.707
OF FEEDBACK FROM. OUR COMMUNITY

00:59:37.774 --> 00:59:39.409
PARTNERS ON WAYS ASSISTANCE

00:59:39.475 --> 00:59:50.186
COULD BE IMPROVED. FINAL

00:59:50.253 --> 00:59:52.255
QUESTION BECAUSE SOME RUMOR

00:59:52.322 --> 00:59:53.723

00:59:58.561 --> 00:59:59.562
PERSPECTIVE I THINK IT'S

00:59:59.629 --> 01:00:01.197
IMPORTANT I'M STRUCK BY THE

01:00:01.264 --> 01:00:03.566
FACT THAT WE KIND OF GOT THE A

01:00:03.633 --> 01:00:06.402
SMALLER COUNTY AND THEN WE HAVE

01:00:06.469 --> 01:00:08.638
THE LARGEST COUNTY IN THE STATE

01:00:08.705 --> 01:00:10.373
AND YOU ALL HAVE ACTUALLY

01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:12.408
REALLY SIMILAR PERSPECTIVE ON

01:00:12.475 --> 01:00:14.210
SOME OF THE KEY CHALLENGES AND

01:00:14.277 --> 01:00:17.080
AT. THE KEY ISSUES THAT WE NEED

01:00:17.146 --> 01:00:19.482
TO CONFRONT I HAVE A QUESTION

01:00:19.549 --> 01:00:24.354
RELATED TO- THE- ANNOUNCED THE

PARTY ADMINISTRATOR SYSTEM AND

01:00:29.692 --> 01:00:32.962
THAT- RULING THAT OUT SHORTLY I

01:00:33.029 --> 01:00:34.497
THINK FROM MY PERSPECTIVE ONE

01:00:34.564 --> 01:00:36.499
OF THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTORS

01:00:36.566 --> 01:00:39.268
IN OUR ABILITY TO SUCCEED IN

01:00:39.335 --> 01:00:40.937
VACCINATING CALIFORNIANS

01:00:41.004 --> 01:00:42.772
QUICKLY SAFELY AND EQUITABLY IS

01:00:42.839 --> 01:00:43.940
ENSURING THAT THERE'S CLARITY

01:00:44.007 --> 01:00:45.441
AROUND EVERYBODY'S ROLES AND

01:00:45.508 --> 01:00:47.110
RESPONSIBILITIES AND WHO'S

01:00:47.176 --> 01:00:48.378
DOING WHAT AND HOW THE PIECES

01:00:48.444 --> 01:00:49.946
OF THE PUZZLE FIT TOGETHER. I

01:00:50.013 --> 01:00:51.914
KNOW WHEN THAT ENHANCEMENT WAS

01:00:51.981 --> 01:00:53.483
FIRST MADE THERE WAS A LOT OF

01:00:53.549 --> 01:00:55.018
QUESTIONS FROM A LOT OF

01:00:55.084 --> 01:00:57.153
COUNTIES ABOUT WHAT THAT MEANT

01:00:57.220 --> 01:00:58.721
FOR THEM AND I THINK THAT THAT

01:00:58.788 --> 01:01:00.590
CREATED A LOT OF CONFUSION- I'M

01:01:00.656 --> 01:01:02.058
FOR BOTH OF YOU HAVE THOSE

01:01:02.125 --> 01:01:04.260
QUESTIONS BEEN ANSWERED AND HAS

01:01:04.327 --> 01:01:07.130
THAT THAT AREA OF CONFUSION

01:01:07.196 --> 01:01:09.198
BEEN CLARIFIED OR IS THAT IS

01:01:09.265 --> 01:01:14.070
THAT STILL SOMETHING THAT- THAT

01:01:14.137 --> 01:01:14.904
NEEDS TO BE CLARIFIED FOR YOU.

01:01:14.971 --> 01:01:16.239
YEAH FROM MY PERSPECTIVE HERE

01:01:16.305 --> 01:01:17.874
IN IN YOLO COUNTY WE STILL

01:01:17.940 --> 01:01:20.610
HAVE. MANY QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT

01:01:20.676 --> 01:01:22.111
THE THIRD PARTY ADMINISTRATOR

01:01:22.178 --> 01:01:24.213
BEING BROUGHT ON WILL WILL MEAN

01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:25.081
FOR US AT THE LOCAL HEALTH

01:01:25.148 --> 01:01:26.783
DEPARTMENT LEVEL IT'S BEEN

01:01:26.849 --> 01:01:28.317
SUGGESTED THAT WILL RECEIVE

01:01:28.384 --> 01:01:30.586
FEWER DOSES. AND THAT OUR ROLE

01:01:30.653 --> 01:01:31.621
WILL BE TO FOCUS ON THE

01:01:31.687 --> 01:01:34.223
UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES- BUT

01:01:34.290 --> 01:01:35.792
THAT'S REALLY KIND OF ALL WE

01:01:35.858 --> 01:01:38.361
KNOW ABOUT- WHAT THINGS WILL

01:01:38.428 --> 01:01:40.163
LOOK LIKE IN THERE THERE REALLY

01:01:40.229 --> 01:01:42.532
IS A SHORTAGE OF. OF DETAIL FOR

01:01:42.598 --> 01:01:43.866
WHAT THIS WILL LOOK LIKE ON A

01:01:43.933 --> 01:01:45.701
DAY TO DAY BASIS FOR HOW THINGS

01:01:45.768 --> 01:01:46.969
WILL BE DONE DIFFERENTLY AT THE

01:01:47.036 --> 01:01:49.338
LOCAL LEVEL UNDER THE THIRD

01:01:49.405 --> 01:01:52.408
PARTY ADMINISTRATOR- SEVERAL

01:01:52.475 --> 01:01:54.243
REALLY AND LOS ANGELES COUNTY

01:01:54.310 --> 01:01:56.412
WE HAVE. UNANSWERED QUESTIONS

01:01:56.479 --> 01:01:59.082
AND- I BELIEVE OUR DIRECTOR AND

01:01:59.148 --> 01:02:01.451
HEALTH OFFICER. WILL VERY

01:02:01.517 --> 01:02:03.286
SHORTLY BE IN DISCUSSIONS WITH

01:02:03.352 --> 01:02:07.457
THE STATE TO. TRY TO. ADDRESS

01:02:07.523 --> 01:02:09.592
THOSE THOSE QUESTIONS. THANKS

01:02:09.659 --> 01:02:18.167
THAT'S HELPFUL. ALL RIGHT IN

01:02:18.234 --> 01:02:19.368
NEW MANAGER COULD I HAVE ONE

01:02:19.435 --> 01:02:21.270
MORE CLASS ONE LAST QUESTION I

01:02:21.337 --> 01:02:23.940
HAD. SO I BELIEVE THE

01:02:24.006 --> 01:02:25.408
DISTRIBUTION AND HOW IT'S DONE

01:02:25.475 --> 01:02:27.176
IS BEING DECIDED AT THE COUNTY

01:02:27.243 --> 01:02:28.711
LEVEL IS THAT NOT YOUR

01:02:28.778 --> 01:02:32.482
UNDERSTANDING FOR BOTH OF YOU.

01:02:32.548 --> 01:02:34.417
IT DEPENDS ON IF THEIR DOSES

01:02:34.484 --> 01:02:36.419
THAT CALM TO THE LOCAL HEALTH

01:02:36.486 --> 01:02:38.688
DEPARTMENT OR DOSES THAT GO TO

01:02:38.754 --> 01:02:40.323
A MULTI COUNTY AND CITY OR

01:02:40.389 --> 01:02:42.191
LARGE HOSPITAL SYSTEM. SO IF

01:02:42.258 --> 01:02:43.459
IT'S DOSES THAT COMES OF THE

01:02:43.526 --> 01:02:44.760
LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT ON THE

01:02:44.827 --> 01:02:46.829
HELP OFFICER OR SOMEBODY ELSE

01:02:46.896 --> 01:02:47.930
AT THE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT

01:02:47.997 --> 01:02:49.432
DETERMINES HOW THOSE DOSES

01:02:49.499 --> 01:02:51.100
ARGUES USE WHETHER THEY'RE

01:02:51.167 --> 01:02:52.902
CAPPED BY THAT THE COUNTY

01:02:52.969 --> 01:02:54.237
HEALTH DEPARTMENT- IT.

01:02:54.303 --> 01:02:55.538
ALLOCATED SO FEDERALLY

01:02:55.605 --> 01:02:57.073
QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTERS OR OR

01:02:57.140 --> 01:02:58.841
OTHER PROVIDERS BUT IF IT'S A

01:02:58.908 --> 01:03:00.643
DOES THAT'S ALLOCATED DIRECTLY

01:03:00.710 --> 01:03:01.811
FROM THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT

01:03:01.878 --> 01:03:03.146
OF PUBLIC HEALTH TO A LARGE

01:03:03.212 --> 01:03:04.881
HEALTH SYSTEM THAT'S DONE AT

01:03:04.947 --> 01:03:06.282
THE STATE WIDER THE REGIONAL

01:03:06.349 --> 01:03:08.184
LEVEL. AND THEN WITHIN THEIR AT

01:03:08.251 --> 01:03:09.318
THEIR HEADQUARTERS OR OUR

01:03:09.385 --> 01:03:11.020
MOTHER SHIP IF IT WORKS THEY

01:03:11.087 --> 01:03:12.788
MAKE THE DECISIONS ABOUT HOW TO

01:03:12.855 --> 01:03:14.357
DISTRIBUTE WITHIN THEIR OWN

01:03:14.423 --> 01:03:16.359
SYSTEMS- AND THAT'S NOT

01:03:16.425 --> 01:03:18.828
CONNECTED TO A COUNTY LEVEL IT

01:03:18.895 --> 01:03:20.663
IN MANY CASES SO FOR EXAMPLE.

01:03:20.730 --> 01:03:22.632
KAISER DOES NOT HAVE A HOSPITAL

01:03:22.698 --> 01:03:24.300
IN YOLO COUNTY BUT THEY DO

01:03:24.367 --> 01:03:26.402
PROVIDE SERVICES TO MANY OF OUR

01:03:26.469 --> 01:03:27.870
OUR RESIDENTS BUT THEY DON'T

01:03:27.937 --> 01:03:29.539
KAISERDOESN'T HAVE A PIECE OF

01:03:29.605 --> 01:03:31.073
THE VACCINE PIE THAT GETS

01:03:31.140 --> 01:03:32.909
DIVIDED UP. FOR YOU'LL COUNTY

01:03:32.975 --> 01:03:35.011
RESIDENTS INSTEAD YOU'LL COUNTY

01:03:35.077 --> 01:03:36.279
RESIDENTS WOULD RECEIVE A

01:03:36.345 --> 01:03:38.047
VACCINE FROM KAISER OUT OF

01:03:38.114 --> 01:03:39.615
FACILITY AND EITHER SOLANO

01:03:39.682 --> 01:03:42.084
COUNTY OR SACRAMENTO COUNTY SO

01:03:42.151 --> 01:03:43.386
THE EMBASSY IS DON'T

01:03:43.452 --> 01:03:44.987
NECESSARILY THINK ABOUT DOES

01:03:45.054 --> 01:03:46.722
THIS FROM THE PERSPECTIVE. OF

01:03:46.789 --> 01:03:48.958
THE COUNTY OF RESIDENCE AT ALL

01:03:49.025 --> 01:03:51.561
OKAY. SO THE REASON I ASK THAT

01:03:51.627 --> 01:03:52.862
QUESTION IS BECAUSE I WAS

01:03:52.929 --> 01:03:54.864
WONDERING IF THE COUNTIES HAVE

01:03:54.931 --> 01:03:55.831
CONSIDER THAT COUNTY HEALTH

01:03:55.898 --> 01:03:57.033
DEPARTMENT HAVE CONSIDERED

01:03:57.099 --> 01:03:58.768
USING BECAUSE THIS IS A BIG

01:03:58.834 --> 01:04:00.570
LOGISTICS ISSUES WHAT IT IS.

01:04:00.636 --> 01:04:01.871
AND IN ORDER TO DO A

01:04:01.938 --> 01:04:03.239
DISTRIBUTION YOU NEED TO GET

01:04:03.306 --> 01:04:04.540
EVERYTHING ORGANIZED AND PUT

01:04:04.607 --> 01:04:05.474
HIM IN THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF

01:04:05.541 --> 01:04:08.077
WORK. AND WE DO HAVE AGENCIES

01:04:08.144 --> 01:04:09.545
DISTRICTS AS CENTER OUT THERE

01:04:09.612 --> 01:04:12.014
LIKE A SCHOOL DISTRICT. THAT

01:04:12.081 --> 01:04:14.050
HAVE THE CAPABILITIES TO

01:04:14.116 --> 01:04:16.586
ORGANIZE COMMUNICATE. AND

01:04:16.652 --> 01:04:22.892
DISTRIBUTE- USING PERSONNEL

01:04:22.959 --> 01:04:23.926
THERE ARE AND- THAT CAN

01:04:23.993 --> 01:04:24.694
ACTUALLY CARE OF PROBLEM ONE

01:04:24.760 --> 01:04:25.494
THING ONE OF A IS GETTING OUR-

01:04:25.561 --> 01:04:26.729
BACK TO SCHOOL. AND THE OTHER

01:04:26.796 --> 01:04:27.797
ONE IS GETTING THE TEACHER

01:04:27.863 --> 01:04:29.599
PACKAGE TEACHERS VACCINATED

01:04:29.665 --> 01:04:32.034
WHICH CAN ALSO TRANSLATE INTO

01:04:32.101 --> 01:04:33.703
FURTHER IF THEY'RE SUCCESSFUL.

01:04:33.769 --> 01:04:35.104
GETTING THE PARENTS OF THOSE

01:04:35.171 --> 01:04:37.273
STUDENTS VACCINATED ALSO. SO

01:04:37.340 --> 01:04:38.307
I'M WONDERING IF THERE IS AN

01:04:38.374 --> 01:04:39.775
OUTREACH EFFORT TO SCHOOL

01:04:39.842 --> 01:04:41.377
DISTRICTS TO PERHAPS GET THEM

01:04:41.444 --> 01:04:45.748
INVOLVED IS A POD- TO. BE ABLE

01:04:45.815 --> 01:04:47.183
TO COORDINATE AND DISTRIBUTION

01:04:47.250 --> 01:04:49.585
PROCESS BECAUSE THEY'RE DIVIDED

01:04:49.652 --> 01:04:51.520
INTO CLASSROOMS THEY CAN EASILY

01:04:51.587 --> 01:04:53.256
MANAGE PEOPLE. THEY HAVE

01:04:53.322 --> 01:04:55.458
COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS IN PLACE

01:04:55.524 --> 01:04:56.192
TO COMMUNICATE WITH EVERY

01:04:56.259 --> 01:04:58.194
SINGLE PARENT. IT TAKES CARE OF

01:04:58.261 --> 01:05:00.162
ALSO TAKES CARE OF THE ISSUE

01:05:00.229 --> 01:05:01.597
OF- ACT IT'LL PULL

01:05:01.664 --> 01:05:04.200
DISTRIBUTION- I KNOW IN OUR

01:05:04.267 --> 01:05:05.368
DISTRICT IN THE AREA THAT WE

01:05:05.434 --> 01:05:06.469
COULD HAVE EVERY TEACHER

01:05:06.535 --> 01:05:08.304
VACCINATED IN TWO DAYS USING

01:05:08.371 --> 01:05:10.740
THE R. ENDS THAT WE HAVE. AND

01:05:10.806 --> 01:05:13.109
SO I'M WONDERING IF THAT HIS

01:05:13.175 --> 01:05:15.211
BAND BECAUSE THAT'S LIKE TO ME.

01:05:15.278 --> 01:05:16.245
A LOT OF TIMES IT'S ABOUT

01:05:16.312 --> 01:05:17.513
GETTING THE LOCAL LOW HANGING

01:05:17.580 --> 01:05:19.548
FRUIT AND THATSEEMS TO BE

01:05:19.615 --> 01:05:20.816
SOMETHING THAT. HAS BEEN

01:05:20.883 --> 01:05:23.519
OVERLOOKED IN A IN A POTENTIAL

01:05:23.586 --> 01:05:25.254
WHEN DID TO GET THESE

01:05:25.321 --> 01:05:27.857
VACCINATIONS OUT. AND TAKE CARE

01:05:27.923 --> 01:05:29.925
OF ANOTHER PROBLEM BESIDES JUST

01:05:29.992 --> 01:05:31.727
TRYING TO GET TO THE SIXTY FIVE

01:05:31.794 --> 01:05:33.896
AND OLDER IS. BECAUSE ALL OF

01:05:33.963 --> 01:05:36.399
ANY OF IT HELPS. BECAUSE IT

01:05:36.465 --> 01:05:37.466
TAKES THEM OUT OF THE SYSTEM OF

01:05:37.533 --> 01:05:40.303
NEED. AND AND THEY CAN DO IT A

01:05:40.369 --> 01:05:41.504
LOT QUICKER THAN WE CAN ALL

01:05:41.570 --> 01:05:43.172
MEN. AND THEY ALSO HAVE A LOT

01:05:43.239 --> 01:05:44.540
OF PARENTS THAT ARE MEDICAL

01:05:44.607 --> 01:05:46.642
PROFESSIONALS DOCTORS NURSES.

01:05:46.709 --> 01:05:47.977
AND PROBABLY CAN ASSEMBLE A

01:05:48.044 --> 01:05:50.846
PRETTY GOOD VOLUNTEER NETWORK-

01:05:50.913 --> 01:05:53.015
TO ASSIST IN THAT AND- SO I WAS

01:05:53.082 --> 01:05:54.617
JUST CURIOUS IF YOU GUYS HAVE.

01:05:54.684 --> 01:05:55.918
THOUGHT OF THAT I KNOW MIGHT BE

01:05:55.985 --> 01:05:56.786
A LITTLE HARDER IN L. A.

01:05:56.852 --> 01:06:01.490
COUNTY- BUT SOME OF THE SMALLER.

01:06:01.557 --> 01:06:02.692
AIRCRAFT MIGHT. CIGRAND ACTUAL

01:06:02.758 --> 01:06:03.859
A LOT OF INTEREST IN L. A. K.

01:06:03.926 --> 01:06:06.028
AMONG SCHOOL DISTRICTS- LA

01:06:06.095 --> 01:06:07.496
UNIFIED UP FOR EXAMPLE IS

01:06:07.563 --> 01:06:07.997
ALREADY MOVING IN THIS

01:06:08.064 --> 01:06:10.232
DIRECTION AND- PARTNERING WITH

01:06:10.299 --> 01:06:12.835
SOME CITIES. IN ADDITION CITIES

01:06:12.902 --> 01:06:14.270
ARE VERY INTERESTED- AND THEY

01:06:14.337 --> 01:06:19.208
HAVE- YOU STAFF THE MERGES C.

01:06:19.275 --> 01:06:20.876
RESPOND YOURS WHO ACTUALLY CAN

01:06:20.943 --> 01:06:24.647
ADMINISTER BACKSTAGE AND THEY

01:06:24.714 --> 01:06:26.015
HAVE GREAT LOGISTICS SUPPORT.

01:06:26.082 --> 01:06:28.150
COOL DISTRICTS EAGER TO HELP

01:06:28.217 --> 01:06:30.653
OUT YEAH REALLY THE LIMITING

01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:34.090
STEP HERE GIVEN HIS VACCINE. SO

01:06:34.156 --> 01:06:35.091
WE WERE ABLE TO GET MORE

01:06:35.157 --> 01:06:36.926
VACCINES WE MAY BE ABLE TO HELP

01:06:36.992 --> 01:06:39.628
THAT DISTRIBUTION PROCESS. AND

01:06:39.695 --> 01:06:40.796
THEY COULD BE LOCALIZED IN THAT

01:06:40.863 --> 01:06:43.599
WAY. AND SPEED THAT UP

01:06:43.666 --> 01:06:46.268

BUT JUST SOME OBSERVATIONS I

01:06:57.446 --> 01:06:58.781
THINK FROM WHAT I HEARD OF THE

01:06:58.848 --> 01:07:01.217
PANELISTS I THINK ONE IDEA THAT

01:07:01.283 --> 01:07:02.718
I THOUGHT WAS PRETTY GOOD AS

01:07:02.785 --> 01:07:06.255
MAY BE UTILIZING FQHCS- A LOT

01:07:06.322 --> 01:07:08.224
MORE THAN WE HAVE BEEN AND I DO

01:07:08.290 --> 01:07:09.859

IN MY EXPERIENCE ANYWAY. THEY

01:07:18.868 --> 01:07:20.569
DO OFTEN HAVE A LOT BETTER

01:07:20.636 --> 01:07:21.937
CONNECTION TO DISADVANTAGED

01:07:22.004 --> 01:07:24.073

01:07:25.941 --> 01:07:27.376
THINK COULD BE HELPFUL SO I

01:07:27.443 --> 01:07:29.044
THINK THAT WAS A GOOD. THE

01:07:29.111 --> 01:07:30.312
THING THAT CAME OUT OF THIS- I

01:07:30.379 --> 01:07:33.783
THINK WE ALL HEARD. POOR DATA.

01:07:33.849 --> 01:07:35.117
AND SO YOU KNOW WE NEED BETTER

01:07:35.184 --> 01:07:37.353
TRANSPARENCY ON. HOW MUCH

01:07:37.420 --> 01:07:38.687
VACCINE IS ACTUALLY BEEN OUT

01:07:38.754 --> 01:07:41.791
THERE HAS IT GOT NOW- AND

01:07:41.857 --> 01:07:43.726
BETTER DATA TRUCK TRACKING. AND

01:07:43.793 --> 01:07:45.561
SO THAT WAS ANOTHER THING THAT

01:07:45.628 --> 01:07:49.899
I THINK I HEARD- IN THIS PANEL-

01:07:49.965 --> 01:07:50.866
ONE OTHER THING WE DIDN'T TALK

01:07:50.933 --> 01:07:53.068
ABOUT SO MUCH BUT I THINK IT'S

01:07:53.135 --> 01:07:55.171
STILL A BIG ISSUE IS. THERE'S A

01:07:55.237 --> 01:07:56.872
LOT OF DISPARITY AS TO HOW THIS

01:07:56.939 --> 01:07:58.641
THING IS BEING DONE AND SO FOR

01:07:58.707 --> 01:08:00.743
INSTANCE. IT WAS MEANT IT WAS

01:08:00.810 --> 01:08:01.510
REFERENCE LITTLE BIT THE

01:08:01.577 --> 01:08:02.845
GOVERNOR ANNOUNCED THAT SIXTY

01:08:02.912 --> 01:08:05.014
FIVE AND OLDER AND FRONTLINE-

01:08:05.080 --> 01:08:06.715
WORKERS IN ONE B. WOULD BE ABLE

01:08:06.782 --> 01:08:08.717
TO BE VACCINATED TOGETHER. SOME

01:08:08.784 --> 01:08:10.352
COUNTIES ARE NOT DOING THAT YOU

01:08:10.419 --> 01:08:12.354

01:08:12.421 --> 01:08:13.956
NO ONLY SIXTY FIVE AND OLDER.

01:08:14.023 --> 01:08:15.124
AND IT CREATES CONFUSION

01:08:15.191 --> 01:08:16.692
BECAUSE PEOPLE THEN GO TO SIGN

01:08:16.759 --> 01:08:17.626
UP AND THINK THAT THEY CAN GET

01:08:17.693 --> 01:08:19.695
VACCINATED. AND THEY CAN'T AND

01:08:19.762 --> 01:08:22.164
SO. AS MUCH AS THERE IS SOME

01:08:22.231 --> 01:08:24.333
CONCERN ABOUT. YOU KNOW THIS

01:08:24.400 --> 01:08:27.536

01:08:35.511 --> 01:08:37.446

CAME TO CALIFORNIA ON DECEMBER

01:14:20.355 --> 01:14:22.224
FOURTEENTH AND I DO WANT TO

01:14:22.291 --> 01:14:23.559
POINT OUT THAT THIS IS REALLY

01:14:23.625 --> 01:14:25.027
HISTORIC THAT WITHIN A YEAR OF

01:14:25.093 --> 01:14:27.062
A- OF A OF A GLOBAL PANDEMIC OF

01:14:27.129 --> 01:14:28.864
THE SEVERITY THAT WE ACTUALLY

01:14:28.931 --> 01:14:31.533
EVEN HAVE A VACCINE- SO IT'S

01:14:31.600 --> 01:14:33.435
BOTH IT'S BOTH POSITIVE BUT THE

01:14:33.502 --> 01:14:34.236
CHIP BUT WE STILL HAVE CHECK

01:14:34.303 --> 01:14:35.737
OUR CHALLENGES AHEAD. THE

01:14:35.804 --> 01:14:37.773
FAXING PRIORITIZATION APPROACH

01:14:37.840 --> 01:14:39.641
WAS STARTED WITH THE ADVISORY

01:14:39.708 --> 01:14:40.776
COMMITTEE ON IMMUNIZATION

01:14:40.843 --> 01:14:43.912
PRACTICES ARE WHAT WE CALL A C.

01:14:43.979 --> 01:14:45.814
I. P. OUR OUR- GUYS. GROUP IN

01:14:45.881 --> 01:14:47.249
OUR COMMUNITY FAXING ADVISORY

01:14:47.316 --> 01:14:48.550
COMMITTEE WORKED WITH THIS

01:14:48.617 --> 01:14:49.918
INFORMATION AND SCIENTIFIC

01:14:49.985 --> 01:14:51.753
EVIDENCE. TO DEVELOP A VACCINE

01:14:51.820 --> 01:14:53.655
PRIORITIES FOR CALIFORNIA THIS

01:14:53.722 --> 01:14:55.057
IS WHAT WE NOW CALL PHASE ONE

01:14:55.123 --> 01:14:56.625
A. AND ONE B. WHICH IS OUR AND

01:14:56.692 --> 01:14:59.127
OUR- OUR COBIT. NINETEEN DOT CA

DOT GOV WEBSITE. THE CURRENT

01:15:01.997 --> 01:15:03.966
ALLOCATION WORKS LIKE THIS. WE

01:15:04.032 --> 01:15:05.467
TAKE WEEKLY AMOUNTS OF VACCINE

01:15:05.534 --> 01:15:06.735
FOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND

01:15:06.802 --> 01:15:08.070
DIVIDE THEM CURRENTLY TO TWO

01:15:08.136 --> 01:15:10.772
POLES. 20% OF THE VACCINES GO

01:15:10.839 --> 01:15:12.574
TO THE MULTI COUNTY ENTITIES

01:15:12.641 --> 01:15:13.542

THE UC SYSTEM. AND 80% OF THE

01:15:18.247 --> 01:15:19.648
VACCINES GO TO LOCAL HEALTH

01:15:19.715 --> 01:15:21.416
JURISDICTIONS AS YOU HEARD FROM

01:15:21.483 --> 01:15:23.318
THE HEALTH OFFICERS. UNDER THE

01:15:23.385 --> 01:15:24.753
CURRENT SYSTEM ALLOCATION

01:15:24.820 --> 01:15:26.688
FORMULA. IS BASED ON THE SIZE

01:15:26.755 --> 01:15:28.257
OF THE PRIORITY GROUP IN THEIR

01:15:28.323 --> 01:15:29.892
IN THEIR COUNTY- MULTI COUNTY

01:15:29.958 --> 01:15:31.960
ENTITY. WE ARE TO BECAUSE WE

01:15:32.027 --> 01:15:34.162
TRANSITION INTO ONE BEING. THAT

01:15:34.229 --> 01:15:35.631
THE FORMULA IS NOW MORE

01:15:35.697 --> 01:15:37.633
POPULATION BASED AS OPPOSED TO.

01:15:37.699 --> 01:15:41.136
INITIALLY. WHICH WAS PRIMARILY

01:15:41.203 --> 01:15:41.770
HEALTH CARE BASED. ONE THING WE

01:15:41.837 --> 01:15:43.171
RELY THAT ALL OF THIS WOULD

01:15:43.238 --> 01:15:44.740
HAPPEN AT THE VERY TIME VERY

01:15:44.806 --> 01:15:46.141
SAME TIME THAT WE HAVE THIS

01:15:46.208 --> 01:15:48.577
TREMENDOUS SURGE. THE SURGE

01:15:48.644 --> 01:15:50.746
REALLY FOCUS NOT FORCES TO

01:15:50.812 --> 01:15:52.915
REALLY THINK ABOUT HOW. WE CAN

01:15:52.981 --> 01:15:53.782
IMPROVE OUR RACKS AND

01:15:53.849 --> 01:15:55.250
VACCINATION APPROACH REALLY

01:15:55.317 --> 01:15:58.186
FOCUSING ON SAVING LIVES TO

01:15:58.253 --> 01:15:59.855
ACHIEVING EQUITY. AND REALLY

01:15:59.922 --> 01:16:01.757
THERE IS THREE THREE KEY WORDS

01:16:01.823 --> 01:16:02.524
ARE REALLY SORT OF CAME OUT OF

01:16:02.591 --> 01:16:03.792
AND THAT IS REALLY FOCUSING ON

01:16:03.859 --> 01:16:07.696
SPEED SIMPLICITY AND SCALE. BOB

01:16:09.031 --> 01:16:10.499
IN ORDER FOR IN ORDER FOR US TO

01:16:10.565 --> 01:16:12.234
IMPACT THE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE

01:16:12.301 --> 01:16:13.602
MOST IMPACTED NOT JUST PEOPLE

01:16:13.669 --> 01:16:15.237
WHO ARE OLDER. BUT AMONG THE

01:16:15.304 --> 01:16:17.205
PEOPLE WHO ARE OLDER. THE VAST

01:16:17.272 --> 01:16:19.675
MAJORITY OF THEM ARE PEOPLE WHO-CAME FROM FROM

01:16:19.741 --> 01:16:21.076
DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED

01:16:21.143 --> 01:16:23.011
COMMUNITIES PRIMARILY LATINO.

01:16:23.078 --> 01:16:25.647
AND AFRICAN AMERICAN. SO FOR ME

AS A CDPH DIRECTOR PART OF MY

01:16:28.250 --> 01:16:29.785
ROLE IS TO REALLY SORT OF FOCUS

01:16:29.851 --> 01:16:31.753
ON HEALTH EQUITY. WE'VE BEEN

01:16:31.820 --> 01:16:34.089
WORKING CLOSELY WITH DR NADINE

01:16:34.156 --> 01:16:35.724
BURKE HARRIS OF THE SURGEON

EQUITY METRICS AND ALLOCATION

01:16:39.027 --> 01:16:40.729
PRINCIPLES ENSURE VACCINE IS

01:16:40.796 --> 01:16:43.899
DISTRIBUTED TO THE MOST

01:16:43.966 --> 01:16:45.100
IMPACTED AREA. ACCORDING WITH

01:16:45.167 --> 01:16:46.902
THE AIM OF THIS AS LAUNCHING A

01:16:46.969 --> 01:16:48.704
VACCINATION A PILOT SITES IN

01:16:48.770 --> 01:16:50.639

IDEA HERE IS SPEED SIMPLICITY

01:17:07.322 --> 01:17:09.358
AND SCALE. YOU'VE ALREADY HEARD

01:17:09.424 --> 01:17:10.625
A LOT OF ISSUES AROUND THE DATA

01:17:10.692 --> 01:17:12.861
WE HAVE TO IMPROVE THE DATA. WE

01:17:12.928 --> 01:17:15.030
WANT TO WE WANT TO MINIMIZE THE

01:17:15.097 --> 01:17:16.898
VERY ABILITY THAT'S AND THAT'S

01:17:16.965 --> 01:17:18.633
UNNECESSARY. AND THE OTHER

01:17:18.700 --> 01:17:19.835

PHARMACY SYSTEMS ARE CLINICS OR

01:17:26.108 --> 01:17:27.709

INPUT FROM THE COMMUNITY. AS

01:19:31.800 --> 01:19:33.568
WELL AS THE EXPERT WORK I

01:19:33.635 --> 01:19:35.036

APPROACH WE IDENTIFIED A NEED

01:19:58.994 --> 01:20:00.795
TO SCALE UP QUICKLY AND

01:20:00.862 --> 01:20:02.564
DETERMINED THAT USING A TRUSTED

01:20:02.631 --> 01:20:03.165
HEALTH PLAN PARTNER WOULD BE

01:20:03.231 --> 01:20:04.966
THE BEST APPROACH. SO THAT WE

SERVING AS THE STATE'S THIRD

01:20:25.453 --> 01:20:27.355
PARTY ADMINISTRATOR. GOING

01:20:27.422 --> 01:20:29.157
FORWARD USING A SINGLE

STATEWIDE NETWORK GIVES US THE

01:20:31.159 --> 01:20:33.061
INSIGHTS WE NEED TO ENSURE.

01:20:33.128 --> 01:20:35.030

JURISDICTION RELATES TO THE

02:03:18.224 --> 02:03:20.860
NUMBER OF INFECTIONS ARE CASES

02:03:20.926 --> 02:03:23.462
OR- OR PERHAPS EVEN THE

02:03:23.529 --> 02:03:25.965
FATALITY RATE. OF THESE CASES

02:03:26.031 --> 02:03:28.134
RIGHT SOME RATIONAL COURSE THAT

02:03:28.200 --> 02:03:29.235
WHERE THE PROBLEM IS WE'RE

02:03:29.301 --> 02:03:30.803
SENDING THE MONEY AND THE

02:03:30.870 --> 02:03:32.638
RESOURCES INSTEAD WHAT WE SEEM

02:03:32.705 --> 02:03:35.074
TO HAVE. IS A MISHMASH OF

02:03:35.141 --> 02:03:38.444
REASONS- RATIONALES EXCUSES AS

02:03:38.511 --> 02:03:40.179
TO WHY THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT

02:03:40.246 --> 02:03:42.181
ALREADY HAVE MORE. ARE STILL

02:03:42.248 --> 02:03:43.816
GETTING MORE AND THOSE OF US

02:03:43.883 --> 02:03:45.184
THAT HAVE LASSER AND EARNED A

02:03:45.251 --> 02:03:47.119
VERY DIFFICULT SITUATION I'VE

02:03:47.186 --> 02:03:49.221
GOT ONE ADDITIONAL DATA POINT

02:03:49.288 --> 02:03:52.525
HERE I'LL SHARE WITH YOU. THAT-

02:03:52.591 --> 02:03:53.926
THAT WAS PASSED ON WITH ANOTHER

02:03:53.993 --> 02:03:56.228
MEMBER SO I CAN'T SPEAK TO-

02:03:56.295 --> 02:03:59.498
THE- ACCURACY OF THIS DOCUMENT.

02:03:59.565 --> 02:04:01.267
BUT AS IT'S BEEN PRESENTED TO

02:04:01.333 --> 02:04:03.836
ME THIS COMPARES THE NUMBER OF.

02:04:03.903 --> 02:04:06.672
CASES TO THE NUMBER OF VACCINES

02:04:06.739 --> 02:04:07.506
RIGHT AND THEN GETS A

02:04:07.573 --> 02:04:10.042
PERCENTAGE SO- IN THE CASE FOR

02:04:10.109 --> 02:04:12.244
EXAMPLE OF KINGS COUNTY. YOU'VE

02:04:12.311 --> 02:04:15.848
GOT 210-002-0090 SEVEN- COATED

02:04:15.915 --> 02:04:17.917
NINETEEN CASES. THEY'VE

02:04:17.983 --> 02:04:20.553
RECEIVED SEVEN THOUSAND SEVEN

02:04:20.619 --> 02:04:21.320
HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FOR VACCINES

02:04:21.387 --> 02:04:24.890
SO THAT'S THIRTY SIX PERCENT-

02:04:24.957 --> 02:04:26.225
OF THE TOTAL CASE SUMMIT

02:04:26.292 --> 02:04:28.460
ACCENTS DOWN OTHER PLACES- FOR

02:04:28.527 --> 02:04:30.629
EXAMPLE. LOS ANGELES THEY'VE

02:04:30.696 --> 02:04:34.033
HAD ONE MILLION ONE HUNDRED

02:04:34.099 --> 02:04:35.267
FORTY NINE THOUSAND CASES AND

02:04:35.334 --> 02:04:37.703
THEY'VE RECEIVED ONE MILLION

02:04:37.770 --> 02:04:38.337
TWO HUNDRED TWENTY ONE THOUSAND

02:04:38.404 --> 02:04:39.705
BACK SEEMS THERE ROUGHLY OVER.

02:04:39.772 --> 02:04:41.674
A ONE TO ONE RATIO SO YOU CAN

02:04:41.740 --> 02:04:44.310
SEE THAT IS A GROSS. INEQUITY

02:04:44.376 --> 02:04:47.046
AND SO. LET ME ASK YOU A COUPLE

02:04:47.112 --> 02:04:50.616
QUESTIONS. HAVING SHARED THOSE

02:04:50.683 --> 02:04:53.619
DATA POINTS WITH YOU- DO YOU

02:04:53.686 --> 02:04:57.089
AGREE THAT. WE'RE USING YOU

02:04:57.156 --> 02:04:58.390
KNOW BUT BY USING HEALTH

02:04:58.457 --> 02:04:59.658
PROVIDERS AND HEALTHCARE

02:04:59.725 --> 02:05:01.594
INFRASTRUCTURE AS PART OF THE

02:05:01.660 --> 02:05:03.929
FORMULA- AS TO HOW WE ALLOCATE

02:05:03.996 --> 02:05:05.598
VACCINES TO COMMUNITIES THAT

02:05:05.664 --> 02:05:07.499
WERE BASICALLY USING AN EQUITY

02:05:07.566 --> 02:05:09.268
TO JUSTIFY A FURTHER INEQUITY

02:05:09.335 --> 02:05:10.970
DO YOU FEEL LIKE THAT'S A FAIR

02:05:11.036 --> 02:05:12.771
STATEMENT OR WOULD YOU TAKE

02:05:12.838 --> 02:05:15.975
ISSUE WITH THAT- DOCTOR. THANK

02:05:16.041 --> 02:05:17.276
YOU THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION-

02:05:17.343 --> 02:05:19.645
I DO I DO UNDERSTAND YOUR

02:05:19.712 --> 02:05:21.647
ANALYSIS WE ARE WE ARE LOOKING

02:05:21.714 --> 02:05:22.882
YOU'RE DOING THAT SOMEWHERE

02:05:22.948 --> 02:05:25.117
ANALYSIS ACROSS THE STATE. AND

02:05:25.184 --> 02:05:26.652
WE YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY CORRECT

02:05:26.719 --> 02:05:28.053
THE LOWER THE LOWER INCOME

02:05:28.120 --> 02:05:30.890
AREAS OF THE STATE- ARE LESS

02:05:30.956 --> 02:05:34.226
FACT ARE LESS VACCINATED. AND-

02:05:34.293 --> 02:05:35.594
PART OF THE CONTRIBUTION IS

02:05:35.661 --> 02:05:36.862
GOING TO BE THE DISTRIBUTION

02:05:36.929 --> 02:05:38.664
RELATED TO HEALTH CARE WORKERS.

02:05:38.731 --> 02:05:39.832
BUT I THINK EVEN THE MOST

02:05:39.899 --> 02:05:41.667
RECENT DATA AS PRESENTED BY LOS

02:05:41.734 --> 02:05:43.702
ANGELES COUNTY SHOWING THAT

02:05:43.769 --> 02:05:45.304
EVEN MORE RECENTLY WITHIN LOS

02:05:45.371 --> 02:05:46.672
ANGELES COUNTY THERE IS-

02:05:46.739 --> 02:05:47.940
INEQUITIES IN WHO'S GETTING

02:05:48.007 --> 02:05:49.808
VACCINATED. AND I KNOW THAT'S

02:05:49.875 --> 02:05:51.143
GOING TO TURN OUT TO BE TRUE

02:05:51.210 --> 02:05:51.844
WHEN WE START LOOKING AT THE

02:05:51.911 --> 02:05:53.846
STATE DATA. SO I YEP WE

02:05:53.913 --> 02:05:55.114
ABSOLUTELY AGREE WITH YOU AND

02:05:55.180 --> 02:05:56.148
THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY

02:05:56.215 --> 02:05:58.050
OUR EQUITY PATRICK. IN OUR

02:05:58.117 --> 02:05:59.118
APPROACH IS REALLY CRITICAL

02:05:59.184 --> 02:06:00.019
BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO BE

02:06:00.085 --> 02:06:01.887
FCUSED USING THAT HEALTHY

02:06:01.954 --> 02:06:03.822
PLACES INDEX. THAT IS GOING TO

02:06:03.889 --> 02:06:05.090
ALLOW US TO FOCUS ON THOSE

02:06:05.157 --> 02:06:06.358
AREAS OF THE STATE THAT HAVE

02:06:06.425 --> 02:06:08.694
LOWER INCOME. SO AREAS LIKE

02:06:08.761 --> 02:06:10.429
MERCED WILL HAVE RECEIVE

02:06:10.496 --> 02:06:12.331
RECEIVE MORE ATTENTION AND MORE

02:06:12.398 --> 02:06:14.233
VACCINE AND MORE RESOURCES SO

02:06:14.300 --> 02:06:17.136
THAT WE CAN ADDRESS THE EQUITY

02:06:17.202 --> 02:06:17.670
THAT YOU SUMMARIZED REALLY

02:06:17.736 --> 02:06:21.140
NICELY. MY PREVIOUS THAT THE-

02:06:21.206 --> 02:06:22.308
YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW FRUSTRATING

02:06:22.374 --> 02:06:24.076
IT IS- PARTICULARLY COMING FROM

02:06:24.143 --> 02:06:25.544
THEIR CULTURAL COMMUNITY WHERE

02:06:25.611 --> 02:06:27.579
MANY OF MY CONSTITUENTS HAVE

02:06:27.646 --> 02:06:29.682
GONE TO WORK THROUGHOUT THIS

02:06:29.748 --> 02:06:31.583
PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS TO ENSURE

02:06:31.650 --> 02:06:33.686
THAT ALL OF US CAN EAT IN LA

02:06:33.752 --> 02:06:35.521
AND SAN FRANCISCO UP AND DOWN

02:06:35.587 --> 02:06:38.624
THE STATE. AND WE'VE AT TIMES

02:06:38.691 --> 02:06:42.461
BEEN THE SUBJECT MY COMMUNITY

02:06:42.528 --> 02:06:44.363
OF KIND OF A HARSH CRITICISM

02:06:44.430 --> 02:06:47.199
THAT- WE WERE OUT WORK IN THAT

02:06:47.266 --> 02:06:49.234
THERE WEREN'T ENOUGH. SAFETY

02:06:49.301 --> 02:06:51.904
MEASURES IN PLACE- WE HAD ONE

02:06:51.971 --> 02:06:53.105
OF THE CAUCUSES HERE I THINK

02:06:53.172 --> 02:06:55.507
LATINO CAUCUS OR WRITE A LETTER

02:06:55.574 --> 02:06:57.443
SUGGESTING- SOME OF OUR

02:06:57.509 --> 02:07:00.012
EMPLOYERS WERE ABUSING THEIR

02:07:00.079 --> 02:07:01.547
EMPLOYEES BY NOT HAVING THAT

02:07:01.613 --> 02:07:07.720
THE NECESSARY- MASS AND

02:07:07.786 --> 02:07:10.255
PRECAUTIONARY- THINGS IN PLACE.

02:07:10.322 --> 02:07:12.491
NOT I'VE HEARD DEAFENING

02:07:12.558 --> 02:07:14.493
SILENCE FROM ALL THE CAUCUSES

02:07:14.560 --> 02:07:15.494
NOW THAT THE VACCINES ARE

02:07:15.561 --> 02:07:16.195
NOBODY'S WRITTEN A LETTER

02:07:16.261 --> 02:07:17.730
SAYING HEY LET'S SEND SOME

02:07:17.796 --> 02:07:19.698
VACCINES TO MERCED COUNTY AND

02:07:19.765 --> 02:07:22.334
HELP OUT. THESE FOLKS WHO'VE

02:07:22.401 --> 02:07:25.137
BEEN FEEDING US ALL FOR MANY

02:07:25.204 --> 02:07:28.207
MANY MONTHS SO IT'S FRUSTRATING

02:07:28.273 --> 02:07:32.578
TO SAY THE LEAST. I APPRECIATE

02:07:32.644 --> 02:07:33.746
HEARING THAT COUNTIES LIKE

02:07:33.812 --> 02:07:35.114
MERCED YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'VE GOT

02:07:35.180 --> 02:07:36.415
THE FIFTH HIGHEST DEATH RATE

02:07:36.482 --> 02:07:37.916
YET WE HAVE THE THIRD LOWEST

02:07:37.983 --> 02:07:39.818
ALLOCATION OF VACCINES. ARE

02:07:39.885 --> 02:07:40.819
GONNA GET TO INCREASE THE

02:07:40.886 --> 02:07:42.321
TENSION AND I KNOW THAT

02:07:42.388 --> 02:07:44.056
SOMETHING YOU ALL BEEN WORKING

02:07:44.123 --> 02:07:45.858
ON I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING.

02:07:45.924 --> 02:07:47.726
THE RESULTS OF INCREASED

02:07:47.793 --> 02:07:49.161
ALLOCATIONS INTO THESE

02:07:49.228 --> 02:07:55.067
COMMUNITIES. OF NEED. BUT I

02:07:55.134 --> 02:07:56.568
HOPE THAT WE CAN SHARE SOME OF

02:07:56.635 --> 02:07:57.636
THE STATE OF THAT I'VE RAISED

02:07:57.703 --> 02:07:59.505
WITH YOU HERE THIS AFTERNOON

02:07:59.571 --> 02:08:00.973
AND WHAT I CAN SHARE SOME OF MY

02:08:01.040 --> 02:08:02.941
COLLEAGUES. AND WE CAN REALLY

02:08:03.008 --> 02:08:05.878
START TO DRILL DOWN ON A- PATH

02:08:05.944 --> 02:08:08.480
FORWARD THAT'S NOT. EACH OF US

02:08:08.547 --> 02:08:10.516
TRYING TO TAKE FROM EACH OTHER

02:08:10.582 --> 02:08:12.251
BUT RATHER JUST A FAIR METRIC

02:08:12.317 --> 02:08:13.719
ACROSS ALL COUNTIES ACROSS ALL

02:08:13.786 --> 02:08:15.821
COMMUNITIES- WE DESPERATELY

02:08:15.888 --> 02:08:18.590
NEED TO GET- A HUGE NUMBER OF

02:08:18.657 --> 02:08:19.591
PEOPLE BACKSTAGE NOT JUST HERE

02:08:19.658 --> 02:08:20.659
IN CALIFORNIA BUT THROUGHOUT

02:08:20.726 --> 02:08:22.594
THE COUNTRY AND- IT'S NOT LOST

02:08:22.661 --> 02:08:23.462
ON ME AND I'M SURE IT'S NOT

02:08:23.529 --> 02:08:24.663
LOST ON MY COLLEAGUES WHEN WE

02:08:24.730 --> 02:08:25.964
PICK UP THE NEWSPAPERS ARE READ

02:08:26.031 --> 02:08:26.732
ABOUT WHAT'S GOING AROUND THE

02:08:26.799 --> 02:08:29.301
COUNTRY. IN MANY CASES THE

02:08:29.368 --> 02:08:32.438
SMALLER. MAYBE YOU COULD SAY

02:08:32.504 --> 02:08:35.307
EVEN MORE CONSERVATIVE. STATES

02:08:35.374 --> 02:08:38.577
THAT HAVE BEEN. LESS FOCUSED IN

02:08:38.644 --> 02:08:42.915
A WAY ON SPECIFIC POPULATIONS

02:08:42.981 --> 02:08:44.416
WERE RATHER JUST ROLLING THINGS

02:08:44.483 --> 02:08:45.851
OUT AND KIND OF GETTING RED

02:08:45.918 --> 02:08:47.953
TAPE AND BLOCKS ON THE WAY SEEM

02:08:48.020 --> 02:08:49.021
TO HAVE HAD SOME SUCCESS AND

02:08:49.088 --> 02:08:50.089
WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT SAME

02:08:50.155 --> 02:08:51.890
SUCCESS REPLICATED IN EVERY

02:08:51.957 --> 02:08:52.691
COMMUNITY I THINK IT'S

02:08:52.758 --> 02:08:54.827
IMPORTANT THAT CALIFORNIA LEAD

02:08:54.893 --> 02:08:56.929
THE WAY IN LOOKING THROUGH AN

02:08:56.995 --> 02:08:59.665
EQUITY LENS THROUGH- METRICS TO

02:08:59.731 --> 02:09:01.867
ENSURE. ACCESS UP AND DOWN THE

02:09:01.934 --> 02:09:03.669
STATE ALL COMMUNITIES THAT'S

02:09:03.735 --> 02:09:04.803
ALSO IMPORTANT WE JUST MOVED

THINGS FORWARD HERE AND-

02:09:07.673 --> 02:09:09.508
SOMETIMES CALIFORNIA LEADS THE

02:09:09.575 --> 02:09:11.477
WAY IN BARACK RECEIVE RED TAPE.

02:09:11.543 --> 02:09:13.278

YEARS TRYING TO SOLDIER ON

02:09:19.251 --> 02:09:22.521
THROUGH CAN'T GET ENOUGH. IT

02:09:22.588 --> 02:09:23.689
LOOKS LIKE THE DOCTOR SAW THE

02:09:23.755 --> 02:09:26.792
SHOW. SO LET'S ALL WORK

STATE I KNOW THAT THE GOVERNOR

BASED ON THAT THERE IS A-

02:13:41.012 --> 02:13:43.148
ALLOCATION PROCESS AND BASED ON

02:13:43.215 --> 02:13:44.249
ALLOCATION PROCESS AND THE

02:13:44.316 --> 02:13:49.688
COUNTY IN THIS CASE. WOULD HAVE

02:13:49.755 --> 02:13:50.622

ROLLOUT IN PROCESS- YOU KNOW

02:23:28.132 --> 02:23:28.633

02:23:28.700 --> 02:23:32.370
CONFUSION- FROM GROCERY CLERK

02:23:32.437 --> 02:23:33.972

02:23:34.038 --> 02:23:35.106
GET VACCINATED BECAUSE THEY'RE

02:23:35.173 --> 02:23:36.474
NOT SURE BECAUSE THE

02:23:36.541 --> 02:23:40.244

02:23:48.019 --> 02:23:49.754
COMMENTS AND SO RIGHT NOW WE

02:23:49.821 --> 02:23:53.625
ARE IN THE PHASE ONE B. E. R.

02:23:53.691 --> 02:23:55.893
WITCHING WHICH INCLUDES- AS WE

02:23:55.960 --> 02:23:58.262
MENTIONED EARLIER ABOUT SIXTY

02:23:58.329 --> 02:23:58.930
FIVE IN THE THREE THE THREE

02:23:58.997 --> 02:24:01.432
SECTORS. WHICH IS EDUCATION

02:24:01.499 --> 02:24:03.334
EDUCATION CHILD KERR FOOD AND

02:24:03.401 --> 02:24:05.570
AGRICULTURAL AND THEN EMERGENCY

02:24:05.636 --> 02:24:08.106
RESPONDENTS. SO WE HAVE PUT UP

02:24:08.172 --> 02:24:11.175
ON THE WEBSITE THERE IS IN AND

02:24:11.242 --> 02:24:13.044
OUT. MAKING OPERATIONAL DOES

02:24:13.111 --> 02:24:15.146
REQUIRE A LOT OF EXTRA A LOT OF

02:24:15.213 --> 02:24:16.547
EXTRA WORK BECAUSE THEN PEOPLE

02:24:16.614 --> 02:24:19.617
ASK OKAY- IF I IF I WORK IN THE

02:24:19.684 --> 02:24:21.719
FOOD INDUSTRY DO I QUALIFY. AND

02:24:21.786 --> 02:24:22.820
SO THAT'S BEEN ONE OF THE

02:24:22.887 --> 02:24:24.722
CHALLENGES OF DOING SEX THAT'S

02:24:24.789 --> 02:24:25.623
ONE OF THE REASONS WHY IT SLOW

02:24:25.690 --> 02:24:28.059
IT SLOWS THINGS DOWN. I'M HONOR

02:24:28.126 --> 02:24:30.028
WEBSITE THERE IS A LINK THAT

02:24:30.094 --> 02:24:31.629
HAS THAT THAT'S BASED ON OUR

02:24:31.696 --> 02:24:34.132
ESSENTIAL- ESSENTIAL JOB

02:24:34.198 --> 02:24:36.134
CLASSIFICATIONS THAT HAS BEEN

02:24:36.200 --> 02:24:37.835
UP THERE FOR A LONG TIME WHICH

02:24:37.902 --> 02:24:39.704
THAT DEFINE THE SOCIAL WORKERS.

02:24:39.771 --> 02:24:41.472
AND IT HAS THOSE SPECIFIC BILL

02:24:41.539 --> 02:24:43.608
SPECIFIC CATEGORIES ARE DEFINED

02:24:43.674 --> 02:24:45.777
ONLINE AND THAT WILL HELP THAT

02:24:45.843 --> 02:24:47.578
WILL HELP IN TERMS OF THE OUR

02:24:47.645 --> 02:24:49.547
REGION AND THE TARGETING. THE

02:24:49.614 --> 02:24:51.516
CHALLENGE WITH SECTORS IS

02:24:51.582 --> 02:24:51.916
REALLY GOING TO BE

02:24:51.983 --> 02:24:54.552
VERIFICATION. AND SO THAT'S

02:24:54.619 --> 02:24:55.920
ALWAYS BEEN A TREND THAT'S

02:24:55.987 --> 02:24:56.487
ALWAYS GONNA BE A CHALLENGE

02:24:56.554 --> 02:24:58.289
WITH SECTORS- AND THAT'S WHY

02:24:58.356 --> 02:25:00.158
WORKING WITH EMPLOYERS WORKING

02:25:00.224 --> 02:25:01.025
WITH COMMUNITY BASED

02:25:01.092 --> 02:25:02.493
ORGANIZATIONS REALLY HAVING

02:25:02.560 --> 02:25:03.961
TARGETED OUTREACH. AND

02:25:04.028 --> 02:25:05.897
VACCINATION SITES THAT ARE MORE

02:25:05.963 --> 02:25:07.965
DIRECTLY INTERACTING WITH THOSE

02:25:08.032 --> 02:25:09.600
WORKERS IS IT'S GOING TO BE OUT

02:25:09.667 --> 02:25:10.701
I THINK PROBABLY MORE

02:25:10.768 --> 02:25:12.570
SUCCESSFUL STRATEGY. AND HOW

02:25:12.637 --> 02:25:13.905
THAT PLAYS OUT IT'S GOING TO

02:25:13.971 --> 02:25:15.406
TAKE IT'S GOING TO TAKE TIME.

02:25:15.473 --> 02:25:16.674
AND I THINK THIS IS PART OF THE

02:25:16.741 --> 02:25:17.942
OUTRAGE IS GONNA BE REALLY POOR

02:25:18.009 --> 02:25:19.877
THE STOCK UP ON MY CELL-

02:25:19.944 --> 02:25:27.552
RODRIGUEZ IS WORKING ON- I HOPE.

02:25:27.618 --> 02:25:28.086
THAT ANSWERS THE MOST YOUR

02:25:28.152 --> 02:25:28.853
QUESTION. YES THANK YOU.

02:25:28.920 --> 02:25:29.787
ACTUALLY HAVE A FOLLOW UP

02:25:29.854 --> 02:25:32.723
QUESTION ALSO RELATED TO THE

02:25:32.790 --> 02:25:35.226
PRIORITIZATION FRAMEWORK- AS

02:25:35.293 --> 02:25:37.862
THE NUMBER CALDERON NOTED IT'S

02:25:37.929 --> 02:25:40.731
CHANGED BOB I THINK FOUR TIMES

02:25:40.798 --> 02:25:42.733
SINCE SINCE DECEMBER IT SOUNDS

02:25:42.800 --> 02:25:44.335
LIKE WE'RE STILL. FINALIZING

02:25:44.402 --> 02:25:46.471
SOME ADDITIONAL CHANGES TO

02:25:46.537 --> 02:25:50.208
THAT- I GUESS CAN YOU SPEAK TO

02:25:50.274 --> 02:25:52.310
WHY THIS IS CHANGING WE'VE HAD

02:25:52.376 --> 02:25:54.278
WE'VE HAD ADVISORY COMMITTEE

02:25:54.345 --> 02:25:57.081
MEETING SINCE APRIL WHY DO WE

02:25:57.148 --> 02:26:00.084
KEEP CHANGING THIS AND-

02:26:00.151 --> 02:26:00.685
BECAUSE- QUESTION ONE NUMBER

02:26:00.751 --> 02:26:03.254
TO. THINK RECOGNIZING THAT

02:26:03.321 --> 02:26:04.856
CONSISTENCY AND CLARITY IS A

02:26:04.922 --> 02:26:06.557
REALLY REALLY CRITICAL BOTH FOR

02:26:06.624 --> 02:26:07.358
THE PUBLIC AND FOR OUR

02:26:07.425 --> 02:26:10.027
PARTNERS- ARE YOU GONNA KEEP

02:26:10.094 --> 02:26:11.362
CHANGING THE FRAMEWORK OR CAN

02:26:11.429 --> 02:26:15.099
WE SAY THIS IS THAT THIS IS OUR

02:26:15.166 --> 02:26:17.135
PLAN. AND IT'S ALL SYSTEMS GO.

02:26:17.201 --> 02:26:18.569
YES SIR IF YOU LOOK AT THE

02:26:18.636 --> 02:26:19.971
FRAMEWORK THAT WAS PUBLISHED

02:26:20.037 --> 02:26:23.508
ONLINE THERE WAS ONE A- ONE

02:26:23.574 --> 02:26:26.244
EIGHT DID NOT CHANGE. ONE B.

02:26:26.310 --> 02:26:29.080
HOW TO TEARS. PEOPLE HAVE

02:26:29.147 --> 02:26:31.149
ALREADY STARTED PHASE ONE B.

02:26:31.215 --> 02:26:33.985
TIER ONE- THAT INITIALLY HAD

02:26:34.051 --> 02:26:35.786
ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE IN THE

02:26:35.853 --> 02:26:37.889
SECTOR GROUPS. SOME AREAS

02:26:37.955 --> 02:26:39.624
STARTED TO DO THAT BECAUSE THEY

02:26:39.690 --> 02:26:41.692
HAD ALREADY MOVED THROUGH PHASE

02:26:41.759 --> 02:26:44.262
ONE DAY IN THEIR AREA FOR

02:26:44.328 --> 02:26:46.164
EXAMPLE THIS IS MORE TRUE OF

02:26:46.230 --> 02:26:47.732
NON URBAN AREAS THEY HAD

02:26:47.798 --> 02:26:49.167
ALREADY VACCINATED HEALTHCARE

02:26:49.233 --> 02:26:51.002
WORKERS AND THEIR COMMUNITIES.

02:26:51.068 --> 02:26:52.436
AND THEIR EVENT AND DEPENDING

02:26:52.503 --> 02:26:54.071
ON THEIR THEIR WORK FORCE THEY

02:26:54.138 --> 02:26:55.806
HAD ALREADY GOTTEN THROUGH FOR

02:26:55.873 --> 02:26:57.341
EXAMPLE BXLEY THE TEACHERS AND

02:26:57.408 --> 02:26:59.677
PEOPLE THAT THAT QUALIFIED AND

02:26:59.744 --> 02:27:01.078
THEY WERE READY TO MOVE ON TO

02:27:01.145 --> 02:27:02.747
PHASE ONE B. SO WE SAID IF

02:27:02.813 --> 02:27:03.681
YOU'RE READY TO MOVE ON TO

02:27:03.748 --> 02:27:05.449
PHASE ONE BEATS HERE ONE GO

02:27:05.516 --> 02:27:07.818
AHEAD. THE FIRST CHANGE WE MADE

02:27:07.885 --> 02:27:10.154
WAS WE TOOK IT WAS AGE SEVENTY

02:27:10.221 --> 02:27:11.822
FIVE IN A BOX. WE ACTUALLY

02:27:11.889 --> 02:27:13.724
MOVED IT DOWN TO SIXTY FIVE IN

02:27:13.791 --> 02:27:15.293
A BAR IN THERE REALLY WAS JUST

02:27:15.359 --> 02:27:18.529
LOOKING AT THE DATA- OF THE

02:27:18.596 --> 02:27:20.932
DEATHS IN CAPTAIN CALIFORNIA SO

02:27:20.998 --> 02:27:22.833
75% OF DEATHS WERE OCCURRING IN

02:27:22.900 --> 02:27:24.869
PERSON SIXTY FIVE AND OLDER AND

02:27:24.936 --> 02:27:25.870
MOST OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE

02:27:25.937 --> 02:27:27.605
DYING WERE PEOPLE WHO WERE

02:27:27.672 --> 02:27:31.976
AFRICAN AMERICAN. AND LATINO.

02:27:32.043 --> 02:27:32.743
AND SO THAT. SO WAS WHAT I WAS

02:27:32.810 --> 02:27:34.812
THE OUR DATA WITH. AT THAT WE-

02:27:34.879 --> 02:27:36.914
HAVE TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. AND

02:27:36.981 --> 02:27:38.282
WE'RE RECOGNIZING THEIR SEX

02:27:38.349 --> 02:27:40.084
DEBATE SECTOR BASED APPROACH.

02:27:40.151 --> 02:27:41.319
IS SLOWER BECAUSE OF THE

02:27:41.385 --> 02:27:42.920
VERIFICATION ISSUE. I DON'T

02:27:42.987 --> 02:27:44.388
REALLY ACROSS THE UNITED STATES

02:27:44.455 --> 02:27:45.756
PEOPLE RECOGNIZE INCLUDING

02:27:45.823 --> 02:27:48.192
OFFICES. RECOGNIZE THAT TAKING

02:27:48.259 --> 02:27:49.360
AN AGE BUT IT'S TAKING A MORE

02:27:49.427 --> 02:27:51.262
DELIBERATE AGE BASED APPROACH.

02:27:51.329 --> 02:27:52.697
WAS NOT ONLY MORE ETHICAL WHO'S

02:27:52.763 --> 02:27:53.965
GONNA BE MORE EFFECTIVE IN

02:27:54.031 --> 02:27:55.633
SAVING LIVES. AND ALSO IN TERMS

02:27:55.700 --> 02:27:57.201
OF IN TERMS OF EQUITY IN TERMS

02:27:57.268 --> 02:27:59.036
OF. PEOPLE BEING ABLE TO SEE

02:27:59.103 --> 02:28:02.206
WHERE THEY ARE AGE WISE. AND SO

02:28:02.273 --> 02:28:02.807
THAT WAS A THAT WAS THE FIRST

02:28:02.873 --> 02:28:04.208
CHANGE THAT WE MADE. ON THE

02:28:04.275 --> 02:28:05.643
SECOND THE SECOND CHANGE THAT

02:28:05.710 --> 02:28:07.311
WE MADE IT IS REALLY NOT WHAT

02:28:07.378 --> 02:28:08.779
HASN'T COME IS GONNA BE THIS

02:28:08.846 --> 02:28:10.448
WHAT'S GONNA COME NEXT. WHICH

02:28:10.514 --> 02:28:12.783
IS GOING TO BE A RECOGNIZING

02:28:12.850 --> 02:28:15.186
THAT. AGES IMPORTANCE AGE IS

02:28:15.253 --> 02:28:16.854
REALLY THE FIRST ONE TO FOCUS

02:28:16.921 --> 02:28:17.388
ON BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THE

02:28:17.455 --> 02:28:19.090
BIGGEST RISK IS YOU HEARD

02:28:19.156 --> 02:28:20.157
EARLIER AND SOME OF THE

02:28:20.224 --> 02:28:22.360
TESTIMONY. WE ALSO HAVE TO DEAL

02:28:22.426 --> 02:28:23.394
WITH PEOPLE HAVE CHRONIC

02:28:23.461 --> 02:28:25.596
MEDICAL CONDITIONS THE PERSON

02:28:25.663 --> 02:28:27.031
WHO HAVE SEVERE DISABILITIES.

02:28:27.098 --> 02:28:28.633
PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES NOT

02:28:28.699 --> 02:28:30.768
ONLY HAVE THE RISK OF. DYING

02:28:30.835 --> 02:28:32.670
FROM KOBE. WHICH SHOULD THEY

02:28:32.737 --> 02:28:34.138
GET INFECTED THEY HAVE THEY

02:28:34.205 --> 02:28:36.207
HAVE. CHALLENGES IN TERMS OF

02:28:36.274 --> 02:28:37.908
GETTING THEY MAY BE HOME BROWN

02:28:37.975 --> 02:28:39.310
THEIR CHALLENGES. THEY MAY NOT

02:28:39.377 --> 02:28:40.344
BE ABLE TO GET THE SITES WERE

02:28:40.411 --> 02:28:41.912
VACCINATIONS AND KERR. SO THEY

02:28:41.979 --> 02:28:43.614
PROVIDE UNIQUE CHALLENGES AND

02:28:43.681 --> 02:28:44.849
SO WE'RE REALLY COMMITTED TO

02:28:44.915 --> 02:28:45.850
MAKING SURE THAT WE ADDRESS

02:28:45.916 --> 02:28:47.585
THAT FROM AN EQUITY ISSUE. SO

02:28:47.652 --> 02:28:48.519
THAT'S REALLY THAT THAT'S

02:28:48.586 --> 02:28:49.553
REALLY THE SECOND CHANGE IN OF

THINK THAT THAT WAS ONE OF THE

02:35:04.995 --> 02:35:07.531
PROBLEMS. WITH WHY WE DIDN'T

02:35:07.598 --> 02:35:10.267

02:35:31.055 --> 02:35:32.523
REQUIRED IN ORDER FOR TESTING

02:35:32.589 --> 02:35:34.124

SUCCESSFUL. RUSSELL IS A RIGHT

02:35:41.031 --> 02:35:41.598
AND I THINK IT'S ALSO GOOD TO

02:35:41.665 --> 02:35:43.167
BE TRUE FOR THE VACCINATION I

02:35:43.233 --> 02:35:44.268

BEGINS YOU KNOW IT WOULD BE

02:35:57.781 --> 02:35:58.649
EXPECTED THAT WOULD TAKE

SEVERAL WEEKS FOR US TO SORT OF

02:35:59.883 --> 02:36:02.853

02:36:40.190 --> 02:36:43.961
FORWARD- PRIORITIZATION. THIS

02:36:44.027 --> 02:36:47.998
IS A BIG ISSUE- WE'VE ALL KNOWN

02:36:48.065 --> 02:36:49.466
FOR A LONG TIME NOW THAT IT WAS

02:36:49.533 --> 02:36:50.968
THOSE SIXTY FIVE AND OLDER WHO

02:36:51.034 --> 02:36:53.337
ARE MORE LIKELY TO DIE FROM

02:36:53.403 --> 02:36:57.107
THIS VIRUS. SO IF WE'VE KNOWN

02:36:57.174 --> 02:36:58.876
THAT FOR A LONG TIME WHY WASN'T

02:36:58.942 --> 02:37:01.145
THAT IN. YOUR TIER ONE EIGHT

02:37:01.211 --> 02:37:03.881
TWO ONE B. FROM THE BEGINNING.

02:37:03.947 --> 02:37:07.384
YOU KNOW. I MEAN WHY WOULD NOT

02:37:07.451 --> 02:37:08.218
HAVE BEEN IN THERE FROM THE

02:37:08.285 --> 02:37:09.553
VERY BEGINNING TO PRIORITIZE

02:37:09.620 --> 02:37:12.689
THEM FIRST NO IT WAS ACTUALLY

02:37:12.756 --> 02:37:13.590
IT WAS ACTUALLY IN THERE FROM

02:37:13.657 --> 02:37:15.359
THE VERY BEGINNING SO WE WORK

02:37:15.425 --> 02:37:17.194
FROM THE NATIONAL GUIDELINES

02:37:17.261 --> 02:37:19.930
THAT INCLUDED FROM THE CDC-

02:37:19.997 --> 02:37:21.265
NATIONAL ACADEMIES OF SCIENCE

02:37:21.331 --> 02:37:23.167
ENGINEERING AND MEDICINE AND

02:37:23.233 --> 02:37:25.302
ALSO THE- ACIP THEY MENTIONED

02:37:25.369 --> 02:37:26.703
EARLIER SO ALL THE SCIENTIFIC

02:37:26.770 --> 02:37:28.272
BODIES GAVE US THAT INITIAL

02:37:28.338 --> 02:37:30.174
FRAMEWORK THAT INITIAL

02:37:30.240 --> 02:37:32.242
FRAMEWORK INCLUDED HEALTH CARE

02:37:32.309 --> 02:37:33.911
WORKERS BECAUSE OF THEIR HIGH

02:37:33.977 --> 02:37:35.179
RISK AND WE NEED THEM TO TREAT

02:37:35.245 --> 02:37:37.214
US. SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES

02:37:37.281 --> 02:37:38.448
AND ASSISTED LIVING FACILITIES

02:37:38.515 --> 02:37:39.650
WHERE YOU REALLY HAVE THE MOST

02:37:39.716 --> 02:37:41.051
VULNERABLE WE NEED FROM THE

02:37:41.118 --> 02:37:42.686
DATA SO THAT ONCE FACED ONE

02:37:42.753 --> 02:37:44.521
DEALT WITH THE MOST AND THEN

02:37:44.588 --> 02:37:46.657
TEAR ONE OF BE ONE HAD SEVENTY

02:37:46.723 --> 02:37:48.225
FIVE AND OLDER SO THAT WAS THE

02:37:48.292 --> 02:37:49.960
THAT WAS BAKED IN FROM THE VERY

02:37:50.027 --> 02:37:51.995
BEGINNING BASED ON DATA. OF THE

02:37:52.062 --> 02:37:53.497
SEARCH THE SEARCH AND LOOKING

02:37:53.564 --> 02:37:56.033
AT OUR DATA MADE US MADE US

02:37:56.099 --> 02:37:58.035
RECOGNIZE THAT WE NEED TO

02:37:58.101 --> 02:37:59.736
REALLY TIGHTEN THAT UP AND WE

02:37:59.803 --> 02:38:01.805
TIED IT UP BY MOVING DOWN TO

02:38:01.872 --> 02:38:02.339
SIXTY FIVE BUT THAT WAS IN

02:38:02.406 --> 02:38:03.574
THERE IT WAS IN THEIR FRONT

02:38:03.640 --> 02:38:04.641
FROM THE BEGINNING BASED ON

02:38:04.708 --> 02:38:06.944
SCIENCE I'M AT THE CRIB- AT THE

02:38:07.010 --> 02:38:08.545
NATIONAL LEVEL. RIGHT WITHIN

PANEL AND SHE SHE LAID OUT THE

02:38:15.018 --> 02:38:17.221
TIMELINE VERY WELL ON JANUARY

THE SECTOR GROUPS STILL STAYED

02:38:44.982 --> 02:38:46.383
IN THERE AND WE ASK THEM TO

02:38:46.450 --> 02:38:48.852
ALSO ANSWER VACCINATING OLDER

02:38:48.919 --> 02:38:51.221
PERSONS ALSO PRIORITIZE THAT

02:38:51.288 --> 02:38:52.856
THE GROUPS AS A SUB CATEGORY

02:38:52.923 --> 02:38:56.927
WELL THAT'S WHAT AND THAT'S NOT

02:38:56.994 --> 02:38:57.761
LIKE A PUBLIC HEALTH. IS THAT

02:38:57.828 --> 02:38:59.129
MEMBER GALLAGHER CAN YOU AS ONE

02:38:59.196 --> 02:39:01.031
MORE QUESTION SO CAN MOVE ON TO

02:39:01.098 --> 02:39:02.366
YEAH MISTER SEA ARTISTS AND

02:39:02.432 --> 02:39:03.767
GIVE I'M SAYING THAT'S NOT WHAT

02:39:03.834 --> 02:39:04.968
THE PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS

02:39:05.035 --> 02:39:05.969
HAVE SAID IS THAT THAT WAS THE

02:39:06.036 --> 02:39:07.371
DIRECTIVE AND THEN ON FEBRUARY

02:39:07.437 --> 02:39:08.739
FOURTH YOU GOT THE GOVERNOR

02:39:08.805 --> 02:39:10.173
CAME OUT WITH THE DIRECTIVE

02:39:10.240 --> 02:39:11.642
THAT YOU COULD DO BOTH.

02:39:11.708 --> 02:39:14.745
CATEGORIES OKAY CORRECT CORRECT

02:39:14.811 --> 02:39:15.879
CORRECT BUT NOW IT WOULD BE ON

02:39:15.946 --> 02:39:17.214
THE ON THE SECTORS AND RAISES

02:39:17.281 --> 02:39:20.350
MY LAST QUESTION BECAUSE IT IS

02:39:20.417 --> 02:39:20.918
REALLY IMPORTANT NOW WE HAVE

02:39:20.984 --> 02:39:21.852
CONFUSION. WE HAVE SOME

02:39:21.919 --> 02:39:24.488
COUNTIES. THAT ARE SAYING NO WE

02:39:24.554 --> 02:39:27.391
CAN ONLY DO SIXTY FIVE AND PLUS

02:39:27.457 --> 02:39:27.991
WE WILL NOT MOVE TO THE OTHER

02:39:28.058 --> 02:39:31.461

02:39:38.302 --> 02:39:39.903
SCHOOLS THEY CANNOT GET

02:39:39.970 --> 02:39:40.871
VACCINATED IN THESE COUNTIES

02:39:40.938 --> 02:39:41.872
BECAUSE THE PUBLIC HEALTH

02:39:41.939 --> 02:39:44.675
OFFICERS HAVE TAKEN A DIRECTOR

02:39:44.741 --> 02:39:45.275
THEY SAID THEY FIRST GOT FROM

02:39:45.342 --> 02:39:48.345
YOU GUYS. TO ONLY DO SIXTY FIVE

02:39:48.412 --> 02:39:48.845

VACCINATED. HAVE GONE WAY INTO

02:39:54.651 --> 02:39:56.653
ONE B. AND VACCINATED NOW WE DO

02:39:56.720 --> 02:40:01.091
MY TURN. IS THAT GONNA CHANGE.

02:40:01.158 --> 02:40:04.094
WHEN A PERSON SIGNS UP IN YUBA

02:40:04.161 --> 02:40:06.096
AND SUTTER COUNTIES WERE AT

02:40:06.163 --> 02:40:06.630
WORK ONE OF THE COUNTIES I

02:40:06.697 --> 02:40:09.099
REPRESENT. IF THEY SIGN UP ON

02:40:09.166 --> 02:40:11.101

IT'S GOING TO BE UNIFORM AND

02:40:29.686 --> 02:40:31.121
THAT AND THAT'S ONE OF THE

02:40:31.188 --> 02:40:31.989
REASONS WHY WE NEEDED TO MOVE

02:40:32.055 --> 02:40:33.490

AND WE TAKE THAT ENTIRE

02:42:19.362 --> 02:42:21.064
ALLOCATION AND SPLIT IT UP

02:42:21.131 --> 02:42:21.898

KIND OF CURIOUS. WHERE THAT

02:42:57.434 --> 02:42:58.401
THAT BOTTLENECK IS. BECAUSE WE

02:42:58.468 --> 02:43:00.137

02:43:04.574 --> 02:43:07.711
I'M NOT AWARE OF- KIND OF US.

02:43:07.777 --> 02:43:09.846
BEING ABLE TO REQUEST A

FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND WE I

02:43:13.750 --> 02:43:14.751
UNDERSTAND THAT IT TRACKS

02:43:14.818 --> 02:43:15.785
PRETTY CLOSELY TO THE

02:43:15.852 --> 02:43:19.589
POPULATION OF EACH STATE AFTER-

02:43:19.656 --> 02:43:22.058
WHATEVER WEEKLY ALLOCATION AS A

02:43:22.125 --> 02:43:25.195

SAY IS THEY REALLY SHOULD BE

02:43:34.871 --> 02:43:36.840
TRACKING THAT ARE ALLOCATING IT

02:43:36.907 --> 02:43:39.576
MORE BASED ON. OUR ABILITY TO

TEN THOUSAND AND IF THE FEDERAL

02:43:50.921 --> 02:43:52.355
GOVERNMENT IS SAYING THAT AND I

02:43:52.422 --> 02:43:53.623
THINK OUR GOVERNOR NEEDS TO

02:43:53.690 --> 02:43:54.858
TALK WITH THE PRESIDENT FIX

02:43:54.925 --> 02:43:56.826
THAT. SO BECAUSE THAT WOULD

02:43:56.893 --> 02:43:58.328
HELP THAT BOTTLE NECK AND THEN

02:43:58.395 --> 02:43:59.696
THAT WOULD NOT WE WOULDN'T HAVE

02:43:59.763 --> 02:44:00.764
TO HEAR THAT ANYMORE THAT WE

02:44:00.830 --> 02:44:02.532
JUST DON'T HAVE THE VACCINE WE

02:44:02.599 --> 02:44:04.134
HAVE THE CAPABILITY TO DELIVER

02:44:04.201 --> 02:44:05.535
BUTWE DON'T HAVE THE VACCINE.

02:44:05.602 --> 02:44:07.103
SO I CAN MOVE ON TO MY SECOND

02:44:07.170 --> 02:44:10.607
QUESTION REALLY QUICK- SO YOU

02:44:10.674 --> 02:44:11.141
KNOW YOU GUYS HAVE TALKED

02:44:11.208 --> 02:44:13.176
ABOUT. TRYING TO UTILIZE THE

02:44:13.243 --> 02:44:15.212
COMMUNITY BASED AGENCIES IS

02:44:15.278 --> 02:44:16.880
THAT A STATE AGENCY- STATE

02:44:16.947 --> 02:44:19.549
DECISION OR A COUNTY DECISION

02:44:19.616 --> 02:44:21.618
ON WHICH AGENCIES GET UTILIZED

02:44:21.685 --> 02:44:23.086
AND I WAS AND I SPEAKING

02:44:23.153 --> 02:44:24.554
SPECIFICALLY I TALK ABOUT

02:44:24.621 --> 02:44:26.089
SCHOOL DISTRICTS. THAT HAVE THE

02:44:26.156 --> 02:44:27.490
CAPABILITY OF GETTING ALL OF

02:44:27.557 --> 02:44:28.825
THEIR TEACHERS PRETTY MUCH

02:44:28.892 --> 02:44:31.027
VACCINATED WITHIN TWO DAYS. AND

02:44:31.094 --> 02:44:33.063
YET. THAT'S JUST NOT HAPPENING

02:44:33.129 --> 02:44:34.030
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO GET

02:44:34.097 --> 02:44:35.699
OUR KIDS BACK TO SCHOOL IN

02:44:35.765 --> 02:44:39.502
ORDER TO HAVE THE TEACHERS.

02:44:39.569 --> 02:44:40.003
HAVE ACCESS TO GETTING

02:44:40.070 --> 02:44:41.671
VACCINATED BECAUSE THAT

02:44:41.738 --> 02:44:46.943
ALLEVIATE. THAT THAT ONE OF

02:44:47.010 --> 02:44:51.615
THOSE ISSUES. COOLEY AND IS

02:44:51.681 --> 02:44:53.016
CURRENTLY FOR THE STATE OVER

02:44:53.083 --> 02:44:54.417
THE PAST FEW WEEKS. I THINK

02:44:54.484 --> 02:44:55.819
IT'S GONNA BE IT'S GONNA BE A

02:44:55.885 --> 02:44:58.288
COMBINATION- IT'S OF BOTH

02:44:58.355 --> 02:45:00.056
WORKING WITH AGENCIES I HAVE

02:45:00.123 --> 02:45:02.259
SAVED STATEWIDE SO FOR THE

02:45:02.325 --> 02:45:03.193
SCHOOLS SCHOOLS SCHOOLS AS IT

02:45:03.260 --> 02:45:04.628
IS A GOOD EXAMPLE. AND THEN

02:45:04.694 --> 02:45:05.962
ASSOCIATIONS THAT REPRESENT

02:45:06.029 --> 02:45:06.896
STAKEHOLDERS THROUGHOUT THE

02:45:06.963 --> 02:45:07.931
STATE THAT'S HOW WE'VE BEEN

02:45:07.998 --> 02:45:10.000
PRIMARILY. DEALING WITH OUT OF

02:45:10.066 --> 02:45:11.368
THIS AT THE STATE LEVEL GETTING

02:45:11.434 --> 02:45:13.370
GETTING IN COURT. AT THE LOCAL

02:45:13.436 --> 02:45:15.372
LEVEL. I WOULD SAY THAT'S WHERE

02:45:15.438 --> 02:45:16.640
THE RUBBER REALLY HITS THE

02:45:16.706 --> 02:45:19.576
ROAD- IT REALLY YOU REALLY NEED

02:45:19.643 --> 02:45:21.111
TO HAVE BOOTS ON THE GROUND TO

02:45:21.177 --> 02:45:23.446
REALLY BE ABLE TO BE EFFECTIVE-

02:45:23.513 --> 02:45:24.547
ACROSS THE STATE SO YOU HAVE TO

02:45:24.614 --> 02:45:26.583
WORK WITH. LOCAL LOCAL-

02:45:26.650 --> 02:45:29.953
POLICYMAKERS ELECTED OFFICIALS-

02:45:30.020 --> 02:45:31.454
AND GOVERNMENT TO REALLY BE

02:45:31.521 --> 02:45:33.323
EFFECTIVE- IF IT CAN'T BE IT

02:45:33.390 --> 02:45:34.924
CAN'T BE JUST AT THE STATE AT

02:45:34.991 --> 02:45:36.559
THE STATE LEVEL BECAUSE- THAT

02:45:36.626 --> 02:45:38.261
THE LOCALS ARE REALLY CLOSE TO

02:45:38.328 --> 02:45:39.396
CLOSER TO WHERE EVERYTHING IS

02:45:39.462 --> 02:45:40.497
HAPPENING. RIGHT AND I

02:45:40.563 --> 02:45:41.731
UNDERSTAND THAT AND THAT'S WHY

02:45:41.798 --> 02:45:44.501
I THINK. AS YOU CAN. ASSEMBLY

02:45:44.567 --> 02:45:46.236
MEMBER GALLAGHER HAD TALKED

02:45:46.303 --> 02:45:48.104
ABOUT EARLIER IS AND WE KNOW

02:45:48.171 --> 02:45:50.173
OUR OUR COMMUNITY'S BEST. AND

02:45:50.240 --> 02:45:51.474
WE REALLY SHOULD BE INVOLVED IN

02:45:51.541 --> 02:45:53.143
THE PROCESS OF TRYING TO

02:45:53.209 --> 02:45:54.377
DETERMINE HOW THESE THINGS

02:45:54.444 --> 02:45:56.446
WORK- BECAUSE WE DO HAVE I

02:45:56.513 --> 02:45:57.881
THINK THERE ARE GOOD IDEAS OUT

02:45:57.947 --> 02:46:00.383
THERE. TO BE ABLE TO- MAXIMIZE

02:46:00.450 --> 02:46:02.752
DISTRIBUTION AND GET IT OUT

02:46:02.819 --> 02:46:04.054
BECAUSE THE MOST EQUITABLE

02:46:04.120 --> 02:46:06.823
THING TO HAPPEN IS FOR A 100%

02:46:06.890 --> 02:46:07.991
OF THE PEOPLE THAT WANT A

02:46:08.058 --> 02:46:12.495
VACCINE. TO GET IT. THANK YOU.

02:46:12.562 --> 02:46:14.664
THANK YOU. THANK YOU THE OTHER

02:46:14.731 --> 02:46:16.132
PROFESSION BURKE I WOULD I JUST

02:46:16.199 --> 02:46:18.234
HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS ON

02:46:18.301 --> 02:46:22.605
AS THE BLUE SHIELD PLAN- IS IT

02:46:22.672 --> 02:46:23.673

02:46:27.711 --> 02:46:28.578
YELLOW COUNTY ANTRIM L. A.

02:46:28.645 --> 02:46:31.014
COUNTY DID SHARE THAT THEY

02:46:31.081 --> 02:46:34.417
STILL DO NOT UNDERSTAND HOW

02:46:34.484 --> 02:46:36.619
THEIR ROLE IS GOING TO CHANGE

02:46:36.686 --> 02:46:40.357
WHEN THAT. IS IMPLEMENTED AND-

02:46:40.423 --> 02:46:42.392
I THINK THAT CONFUSION AND

02:46:42.459 --> 02:46:43.259
FRANKLY I THINK THE MAIN

02:46:43.326 --> 02:46:45.328
VARIETY IS CONSISTENT WITH

02:46:45.395 --> 02:46:46.663
FEEDBACK I'VE HEARD FROM MY

02:46:46.730 --> 02:46:48.965
COUNTY AS WELL ON THURSDAY

02:46:49.032 --> 02:46:50.500
AUGUST DOES THAT SURPRISE YOU

02:46:50.567 --> 02:46:52.602
THAT THEY'RE STILL NOT SURE

02:46:52.669 --> 02:46:55.205
WHAT WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN- AND

02:46:55.271 --> 02:46:57.240
B. WHAT IS OUR CMMUNICATION

02:46:57.307 --> 02:46:59.976
PLAN TO ENSURE THAT OUR

02:47:00.043 --> 02:47:02.545
COUNTIES UNDERSTAND THEIR ROLE

02:47:02.612 --> 02:47:04.647
AND THAT WE CAN MAKE A SEAMLESS

02:47:04.714 --> 02:47:08.785
TRANSITION AND NOT LOSE. FIVE

02:47:08.852 --> 02:47:09.886
NOT LOSE ANY TIME. I THANK YOU

02:47:09.953 --> 02:47:11.020
FOR YOUR QUESTION AGAIN THIS IS

02:47:11.087 --> 02:47:12.122
MARK AGREED WITH THE GOVERNMENT

02:47:12.188 --> 02:47:14.691
OPERATIONS AGENCY. SO WE ARE

02:47:14.758 --> 02:47:15.959
ACTUALLY JUST FINALISING OUR

02:47:16.025 --> 02:47:17.327

02:47:24.033 --> 02:47:25.602
CONFUSION AS WE TRY TO FINALIZE

02:47:25.668 --> 02:47:27.470
THOSE DETAILS WE HAVE STARTED A

02:47:27.537 --> 02:47:29.072

SURE THAT THE TRANSITION IS NOT.

02:47:54.297 --> 02:47:55.932
GOT IT AND- I WILL SAY WE'VE

02:47:55.999 --> 02:47:57.767

AS AS WE MAKE THIS TRANSITION I

02:48:24.861 --> 02:48:25.562
DON'T BELIEVE THAT THAT'S YOUR

02:48:25.628 --> 02:48:27.897

02:50:05.662 --> 02:50:07.630
CONCERN THAT WE'RE GONNA KIND

02:50:07.697 --> 02:50:08.364
OF THREW THE BABY OUT WITH THE

02:50:08.431 --> 02:50:10.667
BATHWATER. AND RATHER THAN

ARE WE GOING TO ENSURE THAT.

02:50:20.176 --> 02:50:20.710

WORK WITH OKAY PARTNER TO

02:50:22.312 --> 02:50:24.047

02:50:37.260 --> 02:50:38.728
CLEAR WE DO NEED TO INTEGRATE

02:50:38.795 --> 02:50:40.296
ALL OF THE DATA SYSTEMS INTO A

02:50:40.363 --> 02:50:41.864
SINGLE DATE. STATE STATEWIDE

02:50:41.931 --> 02:50:43.299
DATA STREAM SO WE CAN HAVE THAT

02:50:43.366 --> 02:50:45.234
LEVEL OF TRANSPARENCY. AGAINST

02:50:45.301 --> 02:50:46.603

ABOUT IT YOU FEEL GOOD ABOUT IT

02:50:50.473 --> 02:50:51.341
THE PUBLIC CAN SEE WHERE

02:50:51.407 --> 02:50:52.775
VACCINES ARE FROM THE MOMENT

02:50:52.842 --> 02:50:54.510
THEY HAD TO THE STATE UNTIL THE

02:50:54.577 --> 02:50:55.244
MOMENT THEY ENTERED SOMEBODY'S

02:50:55.311 --> 02:50:59.382

02:50:59.449 --> 02:51:01.584
HAPPENING IN THE TAX. GREAT AND

02:51:01.651 --> 02:51:03.987

02:51:10.193 --> 02:51:11.327
THINK IT REALLY REALLY WOULD'VE

02:51:11.394 --> 02:51:13.529
BEEN. INCREDIBLY HELPFUL IF WE-

02:51:13.596 --> 02:51:15.365

02:51:15.431 --> 02:51:17.433
THAT WE WERE GOING TO NEED THIS

02:51:17.500 --> 02:51:19.535
