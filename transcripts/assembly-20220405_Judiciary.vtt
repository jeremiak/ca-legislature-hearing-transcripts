01:35:05.499 --> 01:35:07.401
OF OUR WASTE STREAM WE WHOLLY

01:35:07.468 --> 01:35:09.303
AGREE WITH IMPROVING THAT THE

01:35:09.370 --> 01:35:12.573
RECYCLING CALIFORNIA- THE SOURCE

01:35:12.640 --> 01:35:13.374
REDUCTION OF SUPERFLUOUS

01:35:13.441 --> 01:35:16.077
PACKAGING. THAT MANUFACTURES

01:35:16.143 --> 01:35:17.311

THIS IN A VACUUM AB ONE THING WE

01:35:24.585 --> 01:35:25.820
ARE CURRENTLY NEGOTIATING A

01:35:25.886 --> 01:35:28.556
CIRCULAR FIRST IN THE NATION-

BANNED UNDER THIS BILL. AND SO

01:35:35.496 --> 01:35:36.764
WE THINK IT'S PREMATURE AND

01:35:36.831 --> 01:35:37.631
INCONGRUENT WITH THOSE

01:35:37.698 --> 01:35:41.035

WHETHER IT'S GREENHOUSE GAS

01:35:50.711 --> 01:35:52.146
SHIPPING IT BACK OR LANDFILLING

MUCH MORE. UP LARGER BREAKABLE

01:35:54.415 --> 01:35:56.650

THROUGH LANDFILLING THESE

01:35:57.718 --> 01:35:59.587

WE THINK THE APPLICATION PROCESS

02:26:18.402 --> 02:26:19.737
NOW WILL PRESENT A BARRIER FOR

02:26:19.804 --> 02:26:25.109

02:26:25.176 --> 02:26:26.911
PUTS THEM IN THE SAME CATEGORY

02:26:26.978 --> 02:26:29.614
AS SOMEBODY NOW WITH BAD CREDIT

02:26:29.680 --> 02:26:31.015
BECAUSE THEY WILL NOT HAVE

MANY APPLICATIONS ALREADY

02:28:03.708 --> 02:28:05.910
SUBMITTED IT IS A WASTE OF AN

02:28:05.977 --> 02:28:08.145

IF THEY'VE ALREADY OFFERED THE

02:28:19.857 --> 02:28:22.860
UNIT TO SOMEBODY ELSE WE HAVE

02:28:22.927 --> 02:28:25.329
LAW ON THAT ALREADY. TODAY THERE

APPLICANT PAYS ONCE ASSEMBLY

02:28:38.175 --> 02:28:39.744

PROCESS LIKE THAT. I'M AND ONE

02:28:41.812 --> 02:28:44.448
FINAL POINT- I THINK WHAT WE

02:28:44.515 --> 02:28:46.017
HEARD IN THE HOUSING COMMITTEE

02:28:46.083 --> 02:28:48.486
IS THAT- APPLICANTS HAVE GONE

02:28:48.552 --> 02:28:50.388
THROUGH STRINGENT PROCESS.

02:28:50.454 --> 02:28:52.290
THROUGH THE HOUSING AUTHORITY TO

ENSURE THAT THEY ARE VETTED

02:28:55.393 --> 02:28:57.695
THAT'S TRUE BUT THEY ARE VETTED

02:28:57.762 --> 02:29:00.765
NOT FOR THEIR- ABILITY TO PAY

02:29:00.831 --> 02:29:02.400
BUT BECAUSE OF THEIR INABILITY

02:29:02.466 --> 02:29:05.169
TO A PAY. SO REALLY WHAT IT IS

02:29:05.236 --> 02:29:06.637
FOR THIS APPLICANT IS WHAT IS

02:29:06.704 --> 02:29:08.873

02:46:54.170 --> 02:46:55.972
DIRECTLY CONFLICT WITH THE

PROTECTS THE RIGHTS OF AN INFANT

PREMATURELY BORN ALIVE IN THE

02:47:06.516 --> 02:47:09.052
COURSE OF AN ABORTION. AN INFANT

02:47:09.119 --> 02:47:11.221
BORN ALIVE HOLDS THE SAME RIGHTS

02:47:11.287 --> 02:47:13.623
AS AN INFANT BORN SPONTANEOUSLY

02:47:13.690 --> 02:47:16.092

02:47:16.159 --> 02:47:18.461
MAKE THIS SECTION KNOWLAND VOID

02:47:18.528 --> 02:47:20.864
BY PROHIBITING THE INVESTIGATION

02:47:20.930 --> 02:47:23.366
OF THAT INFANT'S DEATH. THE BILL

02:47:23.433 --> 02:47:25.702
ANALYSIS DOES NOT ADDRESS THIS

02:47:25.769 --> 02:47:27.670
CONFLICT OF LAW THAT'S VERY

02:47:27.737 --> 02:47:29.272
TROUBLING FINALLY IT IS

02:47:29.339 --> 02:47:31.408
PARTICULARLY TROUBLING THAT THIS

PROSECUTORIAL IMMUNITY AS WELL.

02:47:39.682 --> 02:47:41.184
FOR ALL OF THESE REASONS WE

02:47:41.251 --> 02:47:44.721
OPPOSE AB TWENTY TWO TWENTY

02:47:44.788 --> 02:47:46.790

THIS BILL. EVEN WITH THE

02:47:57.934 --> 02:47:59.369
ANALYSIS WE STILL DON'T KNOW

02:47:59.436 --> 02:48:00.904
WHAT THE BILL COVERS THE BILL

02:48:00.970 --> 02:48:02.872
SAYS THE STATE SHALL NOT DENY OR

02:48:02.939 --> 02:48:03.773
INTERFERE WITH THE FUNDAMENTAL

02:48:03.840 --> 02:48:04.874

02:48:05.942 --> 02:48:08.178
INTERFERENCE MEAN. NOTORIOUS

02:48:08.244 --> 02:48:09.612
PHILADELPHIA ABORTION DOCTOR

PERFORMING UNSAFE UNSANITARY AND

02:48:13.550 --> 02:48:15.018
DEADLY ABORTIONS BEFORE FINALLY

02:48:15.084 --> 02:48:16.719
BEING CHARGED AND CONVICTED WITH

02:48:16.786 --> 02:48:18.688
FIRST DEGREE MURDER STAFF OF THE

REGULATION OF HIS CLINIC WOULD

02:48:23.827 --> 02:48:25.328
INTERFERE WITH ACCESS EVEN AS

02:48:25.395 --> 02:48:27.597
THEY KNEW WHAT WAS GOING ON. I

02:48:27.664 --> 02:48:29.599
BET HE WISHES HE LIVED IN

02:48:29.666 --> 02:48:30.834
CALIFORNIA EARLIER THIS YEAR A

02:48:30.900 --> 02:48:32.268
BILL IN MARYLAND ALSO USING THE

02:48:32.335 --> 02:48:34.037
WORD PERI NATAL WAS PULLED AFTER

02:48:34.103 --> 02:48:35.672
THE SPONSOR WAS UNABLE TO ANSWER

02:48:35.738 --> 02:48:37.307
BASIC QUESTIONS ABOUT ITS INTENT

02:48:37.373 --> 02:48:38.942
WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT NO

02:48:39.008 --> 02:48:40.844
DEFINITION OF PERI NATAL STOPS

02:48:40.910 --> 02:48:42.445
AT BIRTH. IT'S STATE SANCTIONED

02:48:42.512 --> 02:48:44.247
INFANTICIDE IS NOT THE GOAL THEN

02:48:44.314 --> 02:48:45.915
THIS BILL NEEDS AMENDING

02:48:45.982 --> 02:48:47.550
NUMEROUS CALIFORNIA LAWS COULD

02:48:47.617 --> 02:48:48.918
BE IMPACTED BY THIS BILL

02:48:48.985 --> 02:48:50.353
INCLUDING PARENTAL RIGHTS A

02:48:50.420 --> 02:48:51.488
STATE CRIMINAL LAW AND BORN

02:48:51.554 --> 02:48:53.256
ALIVE PROTECTIONS BUT THERE IS

02:48:53.323 --> 02:48:55.124
NO DISCUSSION IN THE RUSH TO GET

02:48:55.191 --> 02:48:56.726
A GOLD STAR FROM THE ABORTION

02:48:56.793 --> 02:48:57.861
INDUSTRY. LAW ENFORCEMENT WILL

02:48:57.927 --> 02:48:59.128
BE BARRED OR DISCOURAGED FROM

02:48:59.195 --> 02:49:01.498
INVESTIGATING NEWBORN DEATHS

02:49:01.564 --> 02:49:02.832
UNDER THE BILL. HEARING THIS

02:49:02.899 --> 02:49:04.667
TESTIMONY I READ NUMEROUS

02:49:04.734 --> 02:49:05.735
STORIES ABOUT BABIES THROWN IN

02:49:05.802 --> 02:49:07.403
DUMPSTERS BUT RATHER THAN

02:49:07.470 --> 02:49:09.072
EXPANDING CALIFORNIA SAFE HAVEN

02:49:09.138 --> 02:49:10.573
LOT THIS ASSEMBLY WOULD PREVENT

02:49:10.640 --> 02:49:11.641
LAW ENFORCEMENT FROM

02:49:11.708 --> 02:49:13.810
INVESTIGATING HORRIFIC CRIMES.

02:49:13.877 --> 02:49:14.878
THE ANALYSIS SAYS THAT LAW

02:49:14.944 --> 02:49:17.013
ENFORCEMENT CAN INVESTIGATE. BUT

02:49:17.080 --> 02:49:18.715
ONLY UNTIL THEY FIND EVIDENCE OF

02:49:18.781 --> 02:49:20.149
A MOTHER OR ANYONE WHO'S HELPING

02:49:20.216 --> 02:49:21.818
HER IS WRONG DOING. AT WHICH

02:49:21.885 --> 02:49:23.586
POINT THEY OPEN THEMSELVES UP TO

02:49:23.653 --> 02:49:24.587
LEGAL LIABILITY IF THEY PURSUE

02:49:24.654 --> 02:49:26.055
THE CASE. IF ABUSERS AND

02:49:26.122 --> 02:49:27.924
TRAFFICKERS KNOW THAT CRIMES

02:49:27.991 --> 02:49:28.858
RELATED TO ABORTION OR

02:49:28.925 --> 02:49:29.926
CHILDBIRTH WILL GO

02:49:29.993 --> 02:49:31.995
UNINVESTIGATED AND UNPUNISHED.

02:49:32.061 --> 02:49:33.630
IT WILL LEAD TO MORE CASES OF

02:49:33.696 --> 02:49:36.065
CHILD ABANDONMENT. AND DEATH AND

02:49:36.132 --> 02:49:37.867
MORE HARM TO PREGNANT WOMEN

02:49:37.934 --> 02:49:39.068
INFANTICIDE IS AN ACT OR

02:49:39.135 --> 02:49:40.837
OMISSION THAT KILLS A HELPLESS

02:49:40.904 --> 02:49:42.805
BABY. IS ALSO THE LOGICAL NEXT

02:49:42.872 --> 02:49:43.573
STEP TO BE AN ABORTION

02:49:43.640 --> 02:49:45.975
SANCTUARY. IF A BABY HAS NO

02:49:46.042 --> 02:49:47.243
RIGHT TO LIFE AT THIRTY NINE

02:49:47.310 --> 02:49:48.678
WEEKS AND OF CALIFORNIA SEARCH

02:49:48.745 --> 02:49:49.879
NO INTEREST IN DEFENDING OR

02:49:49.946 --> 02:49:51.714
PROTECTING THAT CHILD. THEN WHY

02:49:51.781 --> 02:49:53.216
WOULD THE RIGHT ATTACH JUST

02:49:53.283 --> 02:49:55.318
BECAUSE THE CHILD DRAWS BREATH.

02:49:55.385 --> 02:49:57.153
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BOTH NEED

02:49:57.220 --> 02:49:58.021
NOURISHMENT PROTECTION TO

02:49:58.087 --> 02:50:00.290

THE VICTIM OF A FAILED ABORTION.

03:37:20.193 --> 03:37:22.229
FIRST I DO NOT WISH TO

CRIMINALIZE WOMEN WHO HAVE HAD

03:37:23.597 --> 03:37:25.132

THEIR HEALTH RECORDS. IN FACT IT

03:37:33.373 --> 03:37:34.608
SECOND I WISH TO CLARIFY

03:37:34.674 --> 03:37:36.676
ABORTION IS NOT HEALTH CARE. THE

03:37:36.743 --> 03:37:38.412
ONLY REASON I AM ALIVE TODAY IS

03:37:38.478 --> 03:37:39.679

MY BIOLOGICAL MOM RECEIVED. THE

03:37:41.782 --> 03:37:43.049
ABORTION DOCTOR FAILED TO

03:37:45.051 --> 03:37:46.253
MY LIFE WAS SAVED BECAUSE A

03:37:46.319 --> 03:37:48.221

DOCTOR FAIL SOMEONE DIES. I WAS

03:37:50.557 --> 03:37:51.825
NOT A DISEASE THAT NEEDED TO BE

03:37:51.892 --> 03:37:53.693
TREATED I AM A HUMAN BEING. HOW

03:37:53.760 --> 03:37:54.961
CAN SOMETHING BE CONSIDERED

03:37:55.028 --> 03:37:56.329
HEALTH CARE WHEN THE DESIRED

03:37:56.396 --> 03:37:58.098
OUTCOME IS A HEARTBEAT STOPPED.

03:37:58.165 --> 03:37:59.633
AN ABORTION AS AN OPTION

03:37:59.699 --> 03:38:00.867
EXERCISE WHEN WOMEN ARE LEFT

03:38:00.934 --> 03:38:02.602
UNCARED FOR AND BELIEVE ABORTION

03:38:02.669 --> 03:38:04.704
IS THE ONLY OPTION FOR THEM. OR

03:38:04.771 --> 03:38:05.939
THEY ARE FORCED TO HAVE AN

03:38:06.006 --> 03:38:07.307

03:38:07.374 --> 03:38:08.942

THE RESPONDED TO PAY FOR THAT.

03:57:47.753 --> 03:57:49.188
