THIS IS UP UP PLACE THAT ALONE EXPORTED THIRTY FOUR HUNDRED LINE TROPHY SINCE TWO THOUSAND WITH OVER HALF OF THOSE COMING INTO THE U. S.. CLEARLY TANZANIA'S MODEL OF CONSERVING VIA THE HUNT IS NOT WORKING -- IN RESPONSE THE DEVASTATING LOSS OF LIFE AND TANZANIA AS WELL AS IN NEIGHBORING ZIMBABWE AND ZAMBIA THE U. S. FISH AND WILDLIFE SERVICE REQUESTED DATA ON THEIR POPULATION. AND IN COUNTRY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS BUT RECEIVED ONLY A DOCUMENT FROM NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT OUTLINING GRAND INTENTIONS.

GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS COMMITTEE CAP YOU WANT REPRESENTING SPARK CLUB INTERNATIONAL OUTDOOR SPORTSMAN'S COALITION OF CALIFORNIA. COMPANIES SPORTSMEN'S LOBBY A NATIONAL SHOOTING SPORTS FOUNDATION IN STRONG OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL -- I WON'T BELABOR THE THE WILDLIFE DISCUSSIONS SINCE WE HAVE THAT WATER PARKS MY LIFE BUT WOULD LIKE TO FOCUS ON SOME OF THE LEGAL ISSUES -- FOR THIS COMMITTEE. FIRST ABOUT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THIS BILL IS NOT GERMANE AS IT WAS INTRODUCED AS A PUBLIC UTILITIES CO BILL DEALING WITH TRANSPORTATION. AND IS NOW A FISHING GAME CODE IN THE BILL WOULD SUBSTANTIALLY AMENDED IN APRIL AFTER THE SPOT BILL DEADLINE RULES DO MATTER. BY THIS BILL ATTEMPTS TO REGULATE LEGAL HUNTING AFTER THAT HAS BEEN DETERMINED -- AS PART OF THOSE COUNTRIES MANAGEMENT PLANS THIS IS IN CONFLICT WITH THE FEDERAL ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT FOR FOR MANY SPECIES IN THE US INVALID AND PREEMPTED. I WON'T SPEND THE BULK OF MY TIME ON THIS BUT THERE THESE COUNTRIES DO MAKE SCIENCE BASED DETERMINATIONS UP THERE RESOURCE MANAGEMENT. AND CALIFORNIA'S SITTING IN JUDGMENT OF THE UNITED STATES SPECIAL WILDLIFE SERVICES SITE TO USE. AN INTERNATIONAL UNION FOR CONSERVATION. IN MAKING A DETERMINATION ON HOW TO MANAGE THEIR RESOURCES. I WOULD JUST POINT OUT ONE EXAMPLE THE PROPONENTS HAVE USED -- SINCE TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN BUT BOTSWANA HAS STOPPED ON HUNTING -- AND THEY TELL THAT AS DISCUSSED SUCCESS STORY OF AND IN FACT THAT WAS DONE ON STATE AND COMMUNAL LANDS NOT ON PRIVATE LANDS IN SINCE THAT TIME POACHING IS ACTUALLY INCREASED AND HUMAN WILDLIFE CONFLICTS HAVE INCREASED. AND THEY HAVE NOW PETITION LIBERAL PARTS OF THE STATE HAVE NOW PETITION TO RE OPEN AND IN FACT LAST WEEK ARM SOME OF THAT WAS ACCOMPLISHED -- FOR NON USA SPECIES THERE IS NO SCIENCE TO SUPPORT BANNING THE IMPORTATION OF POSSESSION AND FOR LISTINGS BASED UNITED FRUIT FRESH IN MY LIFE SERVICES AS JURISDICTION. AND DETERMINE OF SCIENCE -- SO WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THE LITIGATION THIS IS DEFINITELY GOING TO END UP IN THE COURTS. OM AND THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY HAD A SIMILAR LAW AND WIN THE STATE REALIZED THAT THEY WERE GONNA GET TOSSED THEY INTERDEPENDENT DECREE. THE SPONSORS OF THIS BILL WOULD SUGGEST THAT CALIFORNIA HAS SOMEHOW FIX THAT BECAUSE THEY'RE ALLOWING YOU TO COME INTO THIS STATE. LEGALLY HUNT LEGALLY POSSESS LEGALLY TRANSPORT BUTTON THIRTY ONE DAYS LATER YOU'RE A CRIMINAL. I WOULD ARGUE THERE ASKING THE OF THAT THE TAXPAYERS OF CALIFORNIA TO BANKROLL LEGAL ACTIONS IF THEY HAVE AN ISSUE WITH THE MANAGEMENT OF THE RESOURCE THAN THEIR LAWSUIT WOULD BE BETTER SERVED AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. NOT ASKING CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS TO TAKE TAKE THE HIT FOR IT -- THEY HAVE SUGGESTED. OF THAT THIS WOULD BE A PRECEDENT -- THAT I THINK THIS COMMITTEE SHOULD BE CONCERNED ABOUT. PERHAPS WE DON'T LIKE -- THE WAY PEOPLE THAT CLOTHING OR JEWELRY OR PERFUMES BECAUSE THEY MIGHT HAVE MATERIALS ARE CHEMICALS AND IN THAT WE DON'T FIND APPROPRIATE. NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN WHAT THAT'S A TAKING -- SENATOR STERN HIMSELF ENJOY SURFING AS A RECREATIONAL PURSUIT SHOULD WE BAN -- SURFING IN AUSTRALIA BECAUSE IT IMPACTS THE MARINE ECOSYSTEM AND IT BRINGS A NICE SURFBOARD BACK IN WE DON'T APPROVE OF THE WAY THAT WAS MANUFACTURED OR MADE UP SOME WOOD SPECIES WE DON'T APPROVE OF SHOULD THAT NOW BECOME FOR SKATED FROM HIM. THIRTY ONE DAYS LATERS PHAM I REALLY ASK YOU TO GIVE THOUGHT TO THE PRESIDENT SENDING NATURE OF THE US. CALIFORNIANS OFF YOU TO WRAP OKAY CALIFORNIANS ALSO BUT* WAY OUT AND SO THERE'S ALSO -- SOME LIABILITY FOR THE STATE THERE THE ISSUE OF IVORY IS OFTEN MENTIONED BUT I WOULD JUST ENCOURAGE THE COMMITTEE TO RECOGNIZE THAT'S FOR COMMERCIAL SALE. NOT THIS IS FOR PRIVATE PERSONAL POSSESSION AND THERE ARE A LOT OF ISSUES WITH WHO ARE THE LAW ENFORCEMENT ENTITY GONNA BE THAT'S GOING TO APPROVE THIS WHAT KIND OF PAPERWORK ARE GONNA HAVE THERE'S A LOT OF RESTAURANTS AND OTHER -- PUBLIC ESTABLISHMENTS THAT HAVE SUCH SPECIES HOW WERE THEY GOING TO BE OF THE DOCUMENT THAT AND OUR FISH AND WILDLIFE SERVICE'S HAS A BACK FILL IN THE BUDGET THIS YEAR OF FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE STATE BECAUSE THEY CAN'T MANAGE THEIR OWN RESOURCES.

AREAS A NATIONAL NONPROFIT LEGAL ORGANIZATION BASED IN SAN FRANCISCO AND OUR MISSION. IS TO PROTECT AND EXPAND ECONOMIC AND EDUCATIONAL ACCESS AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR WOMEN AND GIRLS WE'VE BEEN PURSUING THIS MISSION FOR OVER FORTY YEARS. WE'RE PROUD TO BE CO SPONSORS OF SP NINETY FOUR WHICH WILL ENSURE GREATER REPRESENTATION OF WOMEN ON APPOINTED BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS IN CALIFORNIA. AND REQUIRE DATA COLLECTION IN TRANSPARENCY REGARDING THE GENDER COMPOSITION OF THESE ENTITIES. WHILE WOMEN MAKE UP 50% OF CALIFORNIA'S POPULATION THEY CONTINUE TO BE UNDER REPRESENTED IN GOVERNMENT AND BUSINESS AND IN LEADERSHIP POSITIONS IN GENERAL. WOMEN CURRENTLY REPRESENT JUST LEGISLATURE. THIS MEANS THAT ONLY ONE IN FOR LEGISLATORS ARE WOMEN. AND INDEED WITHOUT POSITIVE EFFORTS LIKE S. B. NINE EIGHTY FOUR PROGRESS FOR WOMEN IS CERTAINLY NOT LINEAR. THIRTY POINT 8% OF THE LEGISLATURE WERE WOMEN IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIX ON THE BUSINESS SIDE IN A STUDY OF THREE THOUSAND GLOBAL COMPANIES WOMEN WERE FOUND A WHOLE JUST FOURTEEN POINT SEVEN OF BOARD SEATS IN. TWENTY FIFTEEN IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN JUST TWENTY SEVEN WOMEN LED FORTUNE FIVE HUNDRED COMPANIES. DIVERSITY IS NOT JUST IMPORTANT PRINCIPLE IN MATTERS BECAUSE DIVERSE LEADERSHIP SHOWN TO PRODUCE BETTER RESULTS. IMPORTANTLY THE BILL WOULD ALSO REQUIRE THE COLLECTION OF AND RELEASE OF DEMOGRAPHIC DATA PROVIDED BY ALL STATE BOARD AND COMMISSION APPLICANTS THE NOMINEES ARE APPOINTEES. RELATED TO ETHNICITY RACE GENDER GENDER IDENTITY AND SEXUAL ORIENTATION THIS TRANSPARENCY IS CRITICAL FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS AND ORGANIZATIONS LIKE OURS WHO WORK TO REPRESENT WOMEN. AND PURSUE DIVERSITY IN THE COURTS AND IN OUR LAWS. MEMBERS OF STATE BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS PLAN ACTIVE ROLE IN GUIDING IMPORTANT POLICY DECISIONS AND GUIDING AND VALUING IMPORTANT CIVIL RIGHTS. THEREFORE WE NEED LEADERS WITH DIVERSE SKILL SETS BACKGROUNDS AND INVALUABLE PERSPECTIVE. FOR THESE REASONS WE ARE PROUD TO CO SPONSOR S. B. NINE EIGHTY FOUR AND URGE YOUR AYE VOTE.

AND WE'RE TRYING TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS DIVERSE REPRESENTATION DIVERSE PERSPECTIVES WHICH WE KNOW ARE KEY TO GOOD GOVERNANCE. I'LL ABBREVIATE MY REMARKS AND I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE A MOTION TO MOVE THIS VERY IMPORTANT BELL I DO WANT TO SAY THAT WE BELIEVE THAT S. B. NINE EIGHTY FOUR HAS THE POTENTIAL TO TRANSFORM THE COMPOSITION OF CALIFORNIA LEADERSHIP. IF YOU SUPPORT THIS CRITICAL LEGISLATION YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO NOT JUST STATE HOW MUCH YOU VALUE THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF WOMEN BUT ILLUSTRATE YOUR COMMITMENT TO LITTLE GIRLS LIKE MY DAUGHTER. BY ENSURING THAT THEY HAVE A SEAT AT THE DECISION MAKING TABLE AND IN FACT THAT THEY ARE NOT ON THE MENU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU OTHERS AND SUPPORTS. IF YOU GIVE US YOUR NAME AND YOUR AFFILIATION. JOHN MICHAEL FOR EQUALITY CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. SEEING NONE IS THERE OPPOSITION. SING NONE BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COMMENTS. SEEING NONE SENATOR REMAIN CLOSE. THANK YOU CHAIR I THINK IT A THE ADDITIONAL BENEFIT BESIDES THAT WAS MENTIONED BY MY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT IS THAT IT PUTS CALIFORNIA IN A LEADERSHIP POSITION. AND THE POSITION THAT SETS A MODEL FOR THE PRIVATE SECTOR WHICH WE HOPE WILL BE EMULATED WITHOUT ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. BUT THANK YOU AND CENTER YOU ARE ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS. AS FOR YES YES THANK YOU EVER. SO THAT MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS KALRA PLEASE STONE BY STONE AYE CUNNINGHAM [inaudible] CHECK OUT. CHAO AYE CHU. CHU AYE HOLDEN. HOLDEN I KALRA.

BUT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND I FIRST WANT TO THANK YOU AND YOUR STAFF ARE FOR WORKING WITH US EXTENSIVELY ON THIS BILL. AYE AND WE'RE HAPPY TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEES PROPOSED. I AMENDMENTS ON ALSO HONORED TO BE JOINED HERE TODAY -- BY THE MAYOR ELECT OF SAN FRANCISCO LONDON BREED WHO WILL BE SWORN IN ON A JULY ELEVENTH -- AND ALSO RAFEAL MAN THE MAN WHO WAS RECENTLY ELECTED TO THE SAN FRANCISCO BOARD OF SUPERVISORS TO THE SEA THAT I USE. TO OUR HOLD ON THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS AND I THANK THEM FOR BEING HERE. ARE WITH US TODAY TO TALK ABOUT THIS IMPORTANT BILL. FUND AS AMENDED I SP. TEN FORTY FIVE CREATES A NEW CONSERVATORSHIP AYE IN THE WELFARE INSTITUTIONS CODE. OUGHT TO ALLOW -- FOR APPOINTED FOR PERSON OF WHO IS INCAPABLE OF CARING OFFER THEIR OWN HEALTH AND WELL BEING. I DO TOO SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS AYE AND SEVERE SUBSTANCE ABUSE DISORDER EYES EVIDENCE BY FREQUENT DETENTION FOR EVALUATION AND TREATMENT. PURSUANT TO SECTION FIFTY ONE FIFTY OF THE WELFARE INSTITUTIONS CODES. OF THE BILL IS A FIVE YEAR PILOT PROGRAM THOUGHT FOR A SAN FRANCISCO AND LOS ANGELES COUNTIES. ODD THIS CONSERVATORSHIP WILL PROVIDE FOR THE LEAST RESTRICTIVE AND MOST CLINICALLY APPROPRIATE PLACEMENT INCLUDING SUPPORTIVE HOUSING AND WRAPAROUND SERVICES WHEREVER POSSIBLE. S. B. TEN FORTY FIVE IS FUNDAMENTALLY ABOUT CREATING A NARROW TOOL. TO CARE FOR THE MOST VULNERABLE I'VE MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY. PEOPLE WHO ARE SUFFERING FROM SEVERE MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE AYE ISSUES AND WHO ARE -- IN MANY CASES TRAGICALLY DYING ON OUR STREETS. BECAUSE THIS IS A TINY SUBSET OF OUR POPULATION. SAN FRANCISCO FOR EXAMPLE ESTIMATES THAT APPROXIMATELY 1% OF OUR HOMELESS POPULATION. WOULD MEET THE CRITERIA AND THE SPELL. THIS DOES NOT APPLY TO THE BASS MAJORITY OF OUR HOMELESS POPULATION -- WHEN PEOPLE ARE WE SEE PEOPLE WHO ARE DYING ON OUR STREETS PEOPLE WHO ARE? SLEEPING IN THEIR FAECES ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE WHO ARE BY ANY DEFINITION. FALLING APART ON OUR STREETS OF PEOPLE WALK BY. AND THEY WONDER AND THEY GET ANGRY WHY IS NO ONE DOING ANYTHING ABOUT THIS. AND THE REASON IS THAT OUR CURRENT CONSERVATORSHIP LAWS WHICH WERE CONSTRUCTED A LONG TIME AGO OR NOT MEETING THE NEEDS OF THIS TINY SUBSET OF THE POPULATION. PARTICULARLY PEOPLE WHO ARE ADDICTED TO DRUGS AND WHO AFTER A SEVENTY TWO HOUR HOLD MAY SOBER UP AND APPEAR PERFECTLY NORMAL WHEN THEY GO BEFORE A JUDGE. NEVER MIND THAT THEY'VE BEEN FIFTY ONE FIFTY SEVEN TIMES IN THE LAST YEAR AND PROBABLY WILL BE AGAIN. IN THE NEXT SEVERAL WEEKS. LIKE ALL CONSERVATIVE SHIPS AND I I AM VERY VERY MINDFUL CONSERVATIVE SHIPS NEED TO BE WE NEED TO HANDLE THEM WITH GREAT CARE. BECAUSE THIS IS BECAUSE THE PEOPLE'S CIVIL LIBERTIES WERE TALKING ABOUT [inaudible] THIS BILL. LIKE OTHER CONSERVATIVE SHIPS MAINS MAINTAINS STRONG DUE PROCESS PROTECTIONS FOR PEOPLE FOR WHOM CONSERVATORSHIP IS SOUGHT. JUDICIAL OVERSIGHT A RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY -- REPRESENTATION BY COUNSEL AND PERIODIC REVIEW BY THE COURT. BOB THIS FOCUSES ON THE PEOPLE WHO NEED IT THE MOST. AND TO BE CLEAR OUR GOAL HERE IS HOUSING AND SERVICES NOT LOCKED FACILITIES WHILE THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE. WHO MAY NEED A LOCKED FACILITY MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE CONSERVED DO NOT AND IN FACT IN SAN FRANCISCO? WE HAVE PEOPLE IN CONSERVATIVE SHIPS WHO WERE LIVING IN SUPPORT OF HOUSING. AND THAT IS ALWAYS THE GOAL HOUSING AND SERVICES ON SO OUR OUR EXISTING LAWS ARE NOT ENOUGH -- WE NEED TO UPDATE THEM WE BELIEVE THAT THIS PILOT PROGRAM WILL ALLOW US OUGHT TO DO THAT. I SO AGAIN WITH ME TODAY ARE MAYOR ELECT BREED AND A SUPERVISOR ELECT ARMANDO MEN -- AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE [inaudible] THANK YOU. FIRST WITNESS PLATES. GOOD MORNING COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND CHAIR STONE -- MY NAME IS LINDENBERG EAT I AM STILL A MEMBER OF THE SAN FRANCISCO BOARD OF SUPERVISORS AND THE MAYOR ELECT. FOR THE CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO I'M REALLY EXCITED TO BE HERE WITH YOU TODAY IN SUPPORT OF THIS VERY IMPORTANT BILL -- I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR TAKING THIS OPPORTUNITY AND THANK SENATOR SCOTT WIENER FOR HIS LEADERSHIP ON THIS. ISSUE -- SP TEN FOUR FIVE HELPS CRITICAL NEED IN SAN FRANCISCO BECAUSE IT OFFERS US A WAY TO HELP SOME OF OUR MOST. VULNERABLE RESIDENTS WHO ARE NOT JUST SUFFERING ON OUR STREETS AND CAN'T CARE FOR THEMSELVES WITH PEOPLE WHO SADLY ARE ALSO DYING ON OUR STREETS. THIS COULD HAPPEN TO ANYONE OF US AT ANY GIVEN TIME TO ANY ONE OF OUR FAMILY MEMBERS AND IT'S THE REAL TRAGIC UNFORTUNATE EXPERIENCE. BUT OUR CURRENT LAWS MAKE IT NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT -- AND I KNOW THAT IF IT WERE ME IF I WERE OUT THERE STRUGGLING -- IN THIS PARTICULAR WAY I'D WANT SOMEONE TO HELP I WANT SOMEONE TO STEP IN. OUR CITY DOES HAVE A LONG HISTORY OF PROVIDING COMPASSIONATE CARE AND WE ABSOLUTELY AGREE THAT LIMITING ANYONE'S CIVIL LIBERTIES MUST BE APPROACHED WITH CAUTION. AND AT THE SAME TIME WE CAN'T IGNORE THE HEARTBREAKING SCENES THAT WE SEE EVERY SINGLE DAY I HAVE PEOPLE ON MY PERSONAL CASELOAD PEOPLE THAT I HAVE TRIED TO HELP THAT I'VE GOTTEN INTO OUR SHELTER SYSTEM. ONE INDIVIDUAL IN PARTICULAR WHO IS UNFORTUNATELY A SCHIZOPHRENIC HE HAS CHALLENGES WITH A DRUG ABUSE -- HE IS A SENIOR CENTER SEND OUR PEOPLE LOVE HIM IN THE COMMUNITY AND THEY WANT TO HELP HIM BUT EVERY NOW AND THEN THERE ARE A NUMBER OF ISSUES WHEN HE CATCHES HIS CHECK AT THE BEGINNING OF THE MONTH HE ALWAYS GETS ITS MONEY TAKEN BY. OTHER PEOPLE ON OUR STREETS HE GETS INTO WITH THE POLICE HAVE MANY APOLOGIZES LATER WE'VE HAD HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES FOR HIM BUT HE NEEDS SUPPORT HE NEEDS A GUARDIAN HE NEEDS SOMEONE. TO SUPPORT AND HELP LOOK AFTER HIM BECAUSE HE CLEARLY CANNOT MAKE DECISIONS FOR HIMSELF I HAVE OTHER FOLKS IN OUR COMMUNITY AND THIS IS JUST IN MY DISTRICT. WHO HAVE FAMILY MEMBERS WHO WANT TO SUPPORT THEM BUT THE CURRENT LAWS MAKE IT SO DIFFICULT AND IN ALL OF THESE INSTANCES THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE ACTUALLY? IN THEIR SIXTIES. AND THEY'RE LIVING ON OUR STREETS. AND WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING MORE THIS IS A TOOL THAT CAN HELP US GET TO A BETTER PLACE. AND WE KNOW THAT FOR A SMALL SUBSET OF THIS POPULATION THE COMBINE A FACT OF UNTREATED MENTAL ILLNESS AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE DISORDER. IS DEVASTATING AND LEAVES THEM UNABLE TO CARE FOR THEMSELVES WE SEE MANY OF THESE INDIVIDUALS ACROSS MANY SYSTEMS OF CARE SEVERAL TIMES A YEAR. AND WE CAN BREAK THE CYCLE WE CAN TO PREVENT THEM FROM CYCLING IN AND OUT OF OUR HOSPITALS AND IN AND OUT OF OUR JAIL SYSTEMS WE ARE CURRENTLY. USING OUR JAILS TO HOUSE PEOPLE WHO NEED TREATMENT. S. B. TEN FOUR FIVE HELPS US DO JUST THAT. WE KNOW THAT WITH ENOUGH TIME ENOUGH SUPPORT THE RIGHT SERVICES THAT WE CAN HELP PEOPLE RECOVER BUT IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT INDIVIDUALS CAN BE HEALTHY. THEY CAN BE HOW THEY CAN BE STABILIZE FOR THE LONG TERM THEY NEED A GUARDIAN THEY NEED AN ADVOCATE SOMEONE WHO CAN MAKE DECISIONS FOR THEM BECAUSE THEY CLEARLY CANNOT MAKE DECISIONS FOR THEMSELVES. WITH THIS BILL WE SEE AN OPPORTUNITY TO HELP PEOPLE GET STABILIZE AND A SAFE PLACE TO SLEEP AT NIGHT AND ACCESS TO INTENSIVE TARGETED SERVICES WE ARE TALKING ABOUT MAKING A MEANINGFUL DIFFERENCE IN THE LIVES OF WHAT I'M OUNCE. TO LESS THAN 1% OF OUR HOMELESS POPULATION IN SAN FRANCISCO. AND I THINK THAT THE CHALLENGE WE HAVE UP IN SAN FRANCISCO WITH HOMELESSNESS IS OF COURSE A BROADER ISSUE IT REQUIRES A NUMBER OF SOLUTIONS TO GET TO A BETTER PLACE. BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE WHO WE DO HAVE THE ABILITY TO HELP AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE. ON THAT WE'RE NOT JUST ALLOW -- PEOPLE WHO CAN'T CARE FOR THEMSELVES ARE TO BE ON THEIR OWN TO BE LEFT ON OUR STREETS BECAUSE THEY HAVE RIGHTS AND I KNOW THAT'S A HARSH THING TO SAY. BUT THE FACT IS WHAT WE'RE DOING IS NOT HUMANE. IT'S NOT COMPASSION AND WE CAN DO BETTER. SAN FRANCISCO IS READY AND WILLING TO SUPPORT THESE INDIVIDUALS IN FACT WE JUST OPENED FIFTY FOUR MENTAL HEALTH STABILIZATION BEDS AND ABOUT THIRTY THREE OF THOSE ARE OCCUPIED. OUR ULTIMATE GOAL IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN SUPPORT PEOPLE THAT THEY CAN LIVE ON THEIR OWN BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY THAT THEY HAVE AN ADVOCATE AND SOMEONE. WHO CAN MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE SAFE AND THAT THEY ARE HEALTHY AND THEY'RE GETTING THE SO SUPPORT AND SERVICES THAT WE NEED AND WE HOPE THAT S. B.? TEN FOUR FIVE WILL BEA TOOL THAT CAN HELP ADDRESS THIS VERY CHALLENGING ISSUE AND I HOPE WE CAN COUNT ON YOUR SUPPORT TODAY TO MOVE IT FORWARD THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS AYE I GAVE THE MAYOR ELECT QUITE A BIT OF LATITUDE I'M GONNA HOLD YOU THREE MINUTES. I WON'T EVEN TAKE THREE LAURIE A GOOD AFTERNOON GOOD AFTERNOON SURE STONE AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE -- AS SENATOR WIENER. SAID I'M RAFEAL MANDOLIN I AM -- THE NEW NEWLY ELECTED MEMBER OF THE SAN FRANCISCO BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. ON AND I'M HERE TO EXPRESS MY STRONG SUPPORT FOR S. B. TEN FORTY FIVE AND THANK SENATOR WIENER FOR TAKING ON A DIFFICULT BUT VERY IMPORTANT. BUILT OVER THE LAST YEAR OF CAMP FOLKS THROUGHOUT -- MY DISTRICT I'VE TALKED TO A LOT OF PEOPLE AND NO WAY SHE WAS MORE FRUSTRATING FOR MY CONSTITUENTS AND NO PUB PUBLIC POLICY FAILURE IS MORE OBVIOUS. PAINFUL AND EMBARRASSING TO OUR CITY THAT OUR INABILITY TO PROVIDE CARE TO SO MANY OBVIOUSLY SICK PEOPLE ON OUR STREETS AND IN OUR PUBLIC SPACES. FOR ME IT'S PERSONAL MY MOTHER SUFFERED FROM MENTAL ILLNESS MUCH OF HER LIFE AND SPENT TIME IN A HOMELESS SHELTER WHEN I WAS YOUNG. I KNOW FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE UNABLE TO CARE FOR THEMSELVES AND IT IS UNREASONABLE TO EXPECT THOSE PEOPLE TO VOLUNTARILY ACCESS SERVICES. AND YET THAT IS PRECISELY WHAT WE DO. AS A LAW STUDENT I WORK TO GET INSTITUTIONALIZED PATIENTS INTO THE LEAST RESTRICTIVE LIVING ENVIRONMENT BUT THE LEAST RESTRICTIVE LIVING ENVIRONMENT CANNOT BE A SIDEWALK. TOO MANY OF OUR NEIGHBORS LIVE ON A RELENTLESS AND COSTLY MERRY GO ROUND THAT CARRIES THEM FROM THE STREETS TO THE HOSPITAL BACK TO THE STREETS TO JAIL AND AROUND AND AROUND AND AROUND AND IT IS INHUMANE. IT IS EXPENSIVE AND IT HAS TO STOP. SAN FRANCISCO DID NOT CREATE THIS PROBLEM BUT WE ARE DOING OUR BEST TO SOLVE IT PLEASE GIVE US THIS DESPERATELY NEEDED TOOL. TO MOVE THE VERY SICKEST AND MOST EXPENSIVE FOLKS OFF THE STREETS AND INTO CARE THANK YOU. THANK YOU OTHERS IN SUPPORT. DEFEAT GIVE US YOUR NAME AND YOUR AFFILIATION I'D KILL NIELSEN WAS SAN FRANCISCO'S OFFICE OF THE PUBLIC CONSERVATOR AND I'M HERE IN SUPPORT OF SB TEN FORTY FIVE AND I'M AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS THAT THE COMMITTEE MIGHT HAVE. HELLO MY NAME IS HEATHER BERNICE AND I'M WITH THE SAN FRANCISCO ASSISTED OUTPATIENT TREATMENT TEAM. ALSO HERE IN SUPPORT AND CAN BE AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU. KILLING HER MOTTO DIRECTOR OF TRANSITIONS WITH CENSUS DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH ALSO AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. ALRIGHT CNN OPPOSITION MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS KERR CHILD DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF A COALITION OF A DISABILITY RIGHTS ORGANIZATION CIVIL RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS MENTAL HEALTH -- ORGANIZATIONS HEALTH ORGANIZATIONS AND HOMELESS ORGANIZATIONS WHO HAVE ALL BEEN OPPOSED TO THE APPROACH THAT SAN FRANCISCO HAS DECIDED TO TAKE -- TO WHETHER WE AGREE IS CERTAINLY. REGRETTABLE SITUATION ON OUR STREETS AND ALL OF CALIFORNIA. LET ME JUST SAY THAT WE REMAIN OPPOSED TO A DESPITE THE AMENDMENTS THAT THE AUTHOR HAS BILL -- AND REALLY THAT'S FOR TWO REASONS WE'VE SPENT DECADES AT THE END DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA. WORKING TOWARD DE INSTITUTIONALIZING. AND THAT IS A CENTERPIECE TO THE WORK THAT WE DO WHETHER THAT BE -- INVOLUNTARY HOLDS WHETHER THAT BE IN THE DEVELOPMENTAL ABLE TO LIVE IN THEIR COMMUNITIES AND RECEIVE THE SERVICES THAT THEY NEED TO STAY AND LIVE IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. SECONDLY WE HAVE A MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM RIGHT NOW THAT IS AT LEAST I WILL SAY IN THE CONTEXT OF CONSERVATORSHIP IS REALLY A BROKEN SYSTEM. AND TO TRY AND OPEN THOSE GATES WIDER TO FORCE INDIVIDUALS INTO THAT SYSTEM WITHOUT THE ASSURANCE OF SERVICES WHETHER THAT'S SUPPORTIVE HOUSING -- WRAPAROUND SERVICES ENSURING THAT THERE'S A MENTAL HEALTH CARE BE -- PHYSICAL HEALTH CARE ALL PROVIDED TO SURE -- THESE INDIVIDUALS THAT THEY DO IN FACT HAVE THE ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO RESIDE IN IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. IT AND I JUST WANT TO MAKE ONE OTHER COMMENT ON THE FACT THAT -- DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA -- IS THE LARGEST DISABILITY RIGHTS ORGANIZATION IN THIS COUNTRY WE HAVE OVER TWO HUNDRED PEOPLE THROUGHOUT THE STATE OR A HUNDRED LAWYERS THAT WORK ON THESE ISSUES WE KNOW THE POPULATION WELL. WE DO LITIGATION IN THE JAILS CONCERNING THE MENTAL HEALTH CARE WE WE UNDERSTAND WELL I'D I HOPE THAT THE COMMITTEE WOULD NOT WALK AWAY AND I KNOW IT IS NOT THE INTENT -- THAT OUR POSITION IS INDEED AND IN HUMANE POSITION WE TAKE A DIFFERENT APPROACH TO ASSURE THAT INDIVIDUALS ARE RECEIVING THE CARE. THAT I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE AND THANK THE THE HELP THAT YOU COMMITTEE COUNSEL BOTH HERE AND THIS COMMITTEE AND THE HEALTH COMMITTEE FOR THE WORK THAT THEY'VE HAD. AT I THINK IN CRAFTING A SET OF AMENDMENTS THAT WILL MAKE THIS BILL -- A LOT STRONGER BILL FOR ASSURING WHAT WE'VE STARTED AS NECESSARY IT AND THESE AMENDMENTS DO SOME I FLEW FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE VERY KEY THINGS. TIME LIMITS THIS PROJECT MAKES IT A PILOT PROJECT -- THE COUNTY MUST DEVELOP AN UP FRONT PLAN ON HOW THEY WOULD IMPLEMENT -- THE PROJECT AND IMPORT THE THAT HAS TO BE DONE WITH THE INVOLVEMENT OF STAKEHOLDERS AND DISABILITY RIGHTS AND OTHER ORGANIZATIONS. IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THAT -- THAT IT MUST ACTUALLY BE ADOPTED BY THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS ONCE. ONCE THERE IS A PLAN AND THERE MUST BE A COMMITMENT OF THE ASSURANCES THAT THERE WILL BE SERVICES PROVIDED -- AND WRAPAROUND DE HOUSING -- AND I THINK THAT CENTRAL THEME THROUGHOUT THE THE AMENDMENTS IS THIS MUST BE DONE IN THE LEAST RESTRICTIVE -- ALTERNATIVE AND WE THINK THAT'S ESSENTIAL -- BUT WE DO WANT TO BE CLEAR ABOUT ONE THING THAT I THINK IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU TINKERING WITH -- INVOLUNTARY COMMITMENTS IS NOT THE ANSWER TO THE PROBLEM THAT EXISTS IN OUR CITY COUNTY STREETS RIGHT NOW. IT IS FUNDAMENTALLY A LACK OF HOUSING. AND FOR THESE INDIVIDUALS IT IS FUNDAMENTALLY A LACK OF HOUSING SUPPORTIVE HOUSING. AND SUPPORTIVE SERVICES THAT ARE NOT BEING MADE AVAILABLE TO THEM THAT'S THE ANSWER AND WE WOULD HOPE THAT THE THIS COMMITTEE AND AND WE KNOW -- CERTAINLY THE THE SITTING. CSCO STAYS FOCUSED ON THIS THAT'S THE REAL ANSWER THAT'S THE REAL SOLUTION THAT WE NEED TO GET TO AND THAT -- WE SUPPORT SO AGAIN I THINK THIS MAKES -- A MUCH BETTER BILL A IF YOU HAVE TO STEP INTO A WORLD OF INVOLUNTARY -- CARE BUT BECAUSE I IT IT IS STILL INVOLUNTARY IT HAS THE INVOLUNTARY NESS OPTION ULTIMATELY TODAY AND WE REMAIN OPPOSED [inaudible] THANK YOU. NEXT WITNESS PLEASE OOD AFTERNOON CHEN FLOOR ON BEHALF OF WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY -- I REITERATE HER CHILD'S COMMENTS REGARDING THE AMENDMENTS I MEAN I THINK WE ARE GOING DOWN THE PATH OF CONSERVATORSHIP WE'VE ADDED MORE DUE PROCESS PROTECTIONS -- AND AND IMPORTANTLY DE INCENTIVIZING CRIMINALIZING HOMELESSNESS THOSE ARE VERY IMPORTANT TO WESTERN CENTER I THINK THE AUTHOR FOR ACCEPTING THOSE AMENDMENTS IN THE COMMITTEE FOR WORKING ON THOSE AMENDMENTS AND IDENTIFYING THOSE ISSUES. HOWEVER SP TEN FORTY FIVE IN MANY WAYS REPRESENTS A COMPLETE FAILURE OF UPSTREAM SOLUTIONS TO AVOID THE PROBLEM IN THE FIRST PLACE I THINK MANY OF THE INDIVIDUALS THAT YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT AT SOME POINT IN THEIR LIFE. THERE COULD HAVE BEEN AN INTERVENTION WHERE SUPPORTIVE HOUSING WITH WRAPAROUND SERVICES EARLY MENTAL HEALTH OR DRUG. PROBABLY NOTHING I SAY HERE IS GOING TO STOP THIS BILL FROM BEING PASSED TO COMMITTEE AND I UNDERSTAND THAT MANY OF THOSE VOTES TODAY ARE COMING FROM A REAL AND GENUINE PLACE OF WANTING TO DO SOMETHING. FROM HUMAN COMPASSION. SO IF THAT'S THE CASE THEN I ALSO OFFER THIS CHALLENGE CONSERVATORSHIP CAN'T BE OUR SAFETY NET. THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS THE UN HUMAN RIGHTS COUNCIL HAS SENT SPECIAL RAPPORTEURS ON HOUSING RIGHTS AND ON EXTREME POVERTY TO BOTH SAN FRANCISCO AND LA AND THE CONDITIONS THEY DESCRIBED WERE SO DEPLORABLE AND SO SKATING. THAT IS A LARGE PART OF THE REASON THAT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION PULLED THE U. S. OUT OF THE UN HUMAN RIGHTS COUNCIL. NO WHERE IN THEIR REPORTS DID THEY IDENTIFY THE LACK OF CONSERVATORSHIP SINCE THE BECAUSE OF EXTREME HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS THAT ARE ENCOURAGING. INSTEAD THEY IDENTIFIED A FAILURE TO CONTROL THE REAL ESTATE MARKET A LACK OF AFFORDABLE IN SUPPORT OF HOUSING THE CRIMINALIZATION OF POVERTY INCLUDING SWEEPS OF HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS AND REMOVING THEIR POSSESSIONS. AND OTHER STRUCTURAL PROBLEMS SUCH AS OUR TAX POLICY. MANY OF THESE ARE ISSUES THAT THIS LEGISLATURE CAN'T TAKE ON NOW I BELIEVE SENATOR WIENER THAT HIS INTENT FOR THIS BILL IS TO DETER ADDRESS A VERY PARTICULAR SUBSET OF PEOPLE WHO CANNOT CARE FOR THEMSELVES. BUT THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE NOT THE ONLY INDIVIDUALS WHO WILL DIE LIVING ON THE STREET. EVERY YEAR HUNDREDS OF THESE INDIVIDUALS DIE FROM EXPOSURE FROM VIOLENCE FROM TREATABLE DISEASE NOT BECAUSE THEY ARE UNAWARE OF HOW TO CARE FOR THEMSELVES BUT BECAUSE SOCIETY HAS FAILED. SO IF YOU'RE VOTING FOR THIS TODAY BECAUSE SOMETHING MUST BE DONE ABOUT THE CRISIS WE ARE FACING IN OUR STREETS THEN I ALSO ASK FOR YOURPARTNERSHIP. IN STOPPING THE ARRESTS OF HOMELESS PEOPLE LIVING ON THE STREETS WE'VE TRIED AT WESTERN CENTER TO ENACT A HOMELESS BILL OF RIGHTS IN THIS YEAR WE COULD EVEN GET AN AUTHOR. PASSING BASIC JUST BECAUSE PROTECTIONS FOR ADDICTION. FAILED THIS YEAR IN THE ASSEMBLY. ENSURING THAT MENTAL HEALTH ACT SERVICES DOLLARS ARE SPENT AS IT INTENDED AND THAT LOCALITY SENIOR DISTRICT ARE NOT BLOCKING THE CONSTRUCTION OF PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING. FUNDING THE CONSTRUCTION OF OF OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN AVOIDING THE DISPLACEMENT OF LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES ADEQUATELY FUNDING OTHER SAFETY NET SERVICES SUCH AS CASH BENEFITS AND HEALTH CARE. TAKING AWAY AN INDIVIDUAL'S FREEDOM EVEN IF FOR THEIR OWN SAFETY IS A SERIOUS MATTER AND DEMOCRACY WE CANNOT GO THERE IF WE ARE NOT HONESTLY DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN TO AVOID SUCH SITUATIONS. SO WHILE WE STILL REMAIN OPPOSED I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH PEOPLE IN PARTNERSHIP TO ADDRESS THESE OTHER SITUATIONS THANK YOU THANK YOU. OTHERS IN OPPOSITION IF YOU COULD JUST GIVE US YOUR NAME AND YOUR AFFILIATION. JERRY MEMBERS KEVIN BAKER FOR THE AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION OF CALIFORNIA. ALLEN GOOD MOTIVES DON'T JUSTIFY MISGUIDED ACTIONS ANYMORE THAN BAD MOTIVES. WE UNFORTUNATELY REMAIN OPPOSED BUT WITH APPRECIATION TO THE COMMITTEE FOR THAT THAT AMENDMENTS INTAKE THANK YOU THANK YOU. KELLY ROSENBERG WITH SERVICE EMPLOYEES INTERNATIONAL UNION ON BEHALF OF OUR MEMBERS THAT REPRESENT THE WORKERS TO PROVIDE THESE NECESSARY SERVICES AND WRAPAROUND SERVICES THAT THEY SO DESPERATELY NEED AND THE COURT WORKERS TO HELP GET THEM -- THROUGH THE SYSTEM WE ARE ALSO AN UNFORTUNATE POSITION TO TO THE SHORTFALL FUNDING AND OTHER -- ISSUES THAT WERE RAISED BY OUR ALLIES THINK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. RIGHT SIGNAL BRING IT BACK TO THAT COMMITTEE. THIS IS A DIFFICULT POSITION. AND I ABSOLUTELY AGREE THAT. SERVICE SHIPS NOT NECESSARILY THE RIGHT TOOL HERE. BUT WE HAVE SUCH AN EXPLOSION IN SUCH A CHALLENGE WITH DEALING WITH WITH HOMELESS [inaudible] THAT. I APPLAUD HIM JUST GO FOR REALLY TRY TO TAKE THE RIGHT STEPS BUT I THINK. WE CAN ALSO SEE SOME OF THE HOLES IN THE OVERALL SYSTEM WE DO HAVE A FRACTURED MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA. AND WE HAVE COUNTIES THAT ARE TAKING A LOT OF PROP SIXTY THREE MONEY BUT CAN'T FIGURE OUT HOW TO SPEND IT. PART OF THAT ARE THE COUNTIES ISSUES BECAUSE THERE ARE A BUT UNWILLINGNESS TO SPEND OR LACK OF A STRUCTURE SPEND IT PART THAT'S THE STATE. INCLUDING SO MANY IMPEDIMENTS IN PLACE. THAT LOW LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ARE AFRAID TO SPEND THE MONEY AND THEY'RE AFRAID TO SPEND THE MONEY IN WAYS THAT. THAT THEY'RE ALSO THREATENED BY NOT BE ABLE TO DRAW DOWN FEDERAL MONIES SO WE HAVE A CONCURRENCE OF A LOT OF DIFFERENT SYSTEMS THAT ARE JUST NOT WORKING. AND PEOPLE ARE ABSOLUTELY FALLING THROUGH THE CRACKS. SO FOR US WE REALLY STRUGGLED WITH THIS BILL THIS NOTION OF OF CONSERVING PEOPLE LOCKING PEOPLE UP TAKING AWAY. THEIR FREEDOMS THAT'S ULTIMATELY NOT THE ANSWER. BUT TRYING TO FIND A WAY. TO GIVE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS SOME TOOLS TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT THEY'RE FINDING ON THEIR DOORSTEP. IS ALSO SOMETHING THAT I THINK THAT REPRESENTS AT THIS POINT AND WHY. THE I'M RECOMMENDING THAT WE THAT WE DO PASSED THIS BILL OUT. BUT WITH SOME CAUTIONS WHAT I DON'T WANT TO SEE IN THIS IS A FIVE YEAR PILOT AND WE'RE GOING TO BE WATCHING SAM CISCO AND AL A TO HEAR HOW THIS GETS IMPLEMENTED. BECAUSE I'M I'M CONCERNED THAT OTHER CHICK JURISDICTIONS AND SAY WELL LOOK WHAT'S AND CISCO'S DOING GIVE US THAT SAME ABILITY. WITHOUT THE WILLINGNESS TO PUT SUPPORTIVE PROGRAMS IN PLACE FOR THE PEOPLE THAT THEY ARE CONSERVING. AND SO SAN FRISCO IS NOT ABLE TO DO THAT OR IS UNWILLING TO DO THAT JUST PUTTING SOMEBODY ELSE IN CHARGE OF SOMEONE'S LIFE OR ENDING UP LOCKING SOMEBODY UP TAKING THEIR FREEDOMS AWAY FROM THEM. IS REALLY NOT GOING TO BE THE ANSWER. SO WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO BE VIGILANT IN THE LEGISLATURE NOW AND ARE GOING TO NEED SEARCHES GOING LA'S SUPPORT. AS THIS MOVE FORWARD. TO SHOW US HOW THIS COULD WORK. OR WHAT THE NEXT STEPS ARE THEN. IF WE'RE GONNA ALLOW THIS TO MOVE THAT WE THEN PROTECT AGAINST SOME OF THE FEARS THAT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP. SO THAT'S REALLY WHAT'S BEFORE US TODAY IS TO SEE OKAY. GIVE IT A SHOT AND I THINK ANYBODY CAN FIGURE THIS OUT PROBABLY DESERVES CISCO YOU'VE SHOWN A WILLINGNESS TO RAISE FUNDS YOUR SON A WILLINGNESS TO INVEST IN APPROPRIATE PLACES. SO LET'S MAKE SURE THAT THIS WORKS. OTHERWISE THERE'S GOING TO BE THIS LONG PRESSURE ON US TO SAY WILL LET US DO THE SAME THING. FROM JURISDICTIONS THAT MAY NOT BE. AS WELL POSITIONED MAY NOT HAVE THE RESOURCES MAY NOT REALLY BE WILLING. THEY'LL TAKE A TOOL AND APPLY IT DIFFERENTLY THAN WE WOULD WANT TO SEE HAPPEN THAT'S KIND OF SOME OF THE DANGER THAT WE'RE WORKING WITH HERE. THAT'S TO TRUST THAT WERE POLICING IN YOU BY MOVING THE BILL [inaudible] AND THAT OUR OBLIGATION IS. TO DO THE OVERSIGHT TO WATCH TO SEE HOW THIS WORKS AND IF IT CAN WORK AND IF WE GET A MODEL BACK. OF HOW WE CAN ADDRESS CHRONIC HOMELESSNESS AND THE AND THESE INDIVIDUALS IN CITIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA. HOPEFULLY SOMETHING THAT WE CAN BUILD ON AND BRING ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS. TO THE TABLE AND SEE HOW WE CAN REALLY IMPROVE IT. BUT CITIES AND COUNTIES ARE GONNA HAVE TO SPEND THEM THE PROP SIXTY THREE MONEY THAT THEY HAVE. WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO FIX. THE SYSTEMIC PROBLEMS WITH THE MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM AT THE STATE LEVEL HOPING WITH THE NEXT ADMINISTRATION WE CAN. CAN PUSH THAT EVEN HARDER HERE AND HAVE THE SERVICES AVAILABLE AND REALLY INVEST IN THE COMMUNITIES THAT. IN THE WAY WE KNOW WE NEED. TO TWO WOULD ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF THE PEOPLE SO THAT THERE THAT WE DON'T HAVE THE SITUATIONS. ON CITY STREETS THAT WERE THAT WERE DESCRIBED. SO IT'S A DIFFICULT. ONE BUT I AM RECOMMENDING AND I APPRECIATE THE THAT YOU TAKE THE TOOK THE AMENDMENTS AND THAT SITTING COUNTIES ARE TO SCHOOL WILL BE A REAL PARTNER. WITH US AND WITH HE STAKEHOLDERS TO SOLVING THE PROBLEM AND FINING SOME PATHWAYS TO GIVE PEOPLE DIGNITY GIVE PEOPLE A AT A CHANCE AT LIFE. AND NOT BE JUST SWEEPING THEM UP BECAUSE THAT'S THE EASIEST ANSWER AND I KNOW THAT'S NOT HER GOAL HERE. BUT THAT'S GOING TO BE THE GOAL OF OTHER JURISDICTIONS THAT'S PART OF MY CAN [inaudible] ALRIGHT -- SO IT'S CHIU MISTER CUNNINGHAM. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO THANK YOU AND YOUR STAFF -- FOR AS USUAL -- IT YOU'RE YOU'RE CAREFUL ANALYSIS AND AND COMPASSIONATE LOOK AT THIS ISSUE. AND I THINK THE SENATE AUTHOR FOR HIS LEADERSHIP AS WELL AS ARE FILLED ACTED OFFICIALS FROM SAN BREED -- SUPERVISOR ELECT MANAGEMENT AND LET ME SAY TO MY COLLEAGUES -- THAT WHILE YOU MAY SEE A THREE OR FOUR SAN FRANCISCO ELECTED HERE WE ACTUALLY REPRESENT QUITE A DIVERSITY OF PERSPECTIVES IN OUR CITY. AYE AND THE FACT THAT WE ALL STAND TOGETHER FOR THIS I THINK IS SIGNIFICANT. ARE I ALSO WANT TO APPRECIATE THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE OPPOSITION WITH HIM I OFTEN AGREE ON MANY ISSUES. ARE I THINK THE AUTHORS TAKEN AMENDMENTS TO CONTINUE TO MAKE THIS BILL BETTER. I WILL SAY IN RESPONSE -- TO THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE WESTERN CENTER -- I CAN ATTEST THAT SAN FRANCISCO IS DOING EVERYTHING IT CAN TO TRY TO ADDRESS. OF THE MYRIAD OF OTHER POLICY ISSUES THAT YOU RAISED AS FAR AS ADDRESSING AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND TRYING TO MOVE FOR PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING. AND MOVING FOR PROGRESSIVE CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM ARE AS WELL AS TRYING TO HAVE THE MOST -- PROTECTIVE -- POLICIES WHEN IT COMES TO TO TENANT RIGHTS. YOU'VE OFTEN HEARD ME COLLEAGUES SAY THAT -- AS THE CHAIR OF THE ASSEMBLY HOUSING COMMITTEE OUR STATE NOT JUST OUR CITIES BUT OUR STATE IS IN THE WORST IN THE MIDDLE OF THE MOST INTENSE. HOMELESSNESS CRISIS WE HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED AND WE OFTEN HEAR THAT OFTEN. EXPRESSED PERSPECTIVE THAT THE DEFINITION OF INSANITY IS DOING THE SAME THING OVER AND OVER AGAIN. BY SUPPORT THIS IN PART BECAUSE AS HAS BEEN SAID WITHFOLKS WERE DYING ON THE STREETS WITH INDIVIDUALS WHO RECYCLING. DALY AND THEN OUT OF OUR JAIL SYSTEM IN AND OUT OF OUR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IN AND OUT OF EMERGENCY ROOMS. WE HAVE TO TRY DIFFERENT THINGS AND I DO THINK THIS IS A MODEST STEP FORWARD I DO THINK IT IS STRUCTURED AS A PILOT SO AS ARCHER SAID. WE WILL BE CAREFULLY MONITORING THIS WE DO EXPECT THERE TO BE RESULTS THAT WE CAN MEASURE AYE AND TRULY UNDERSTAND BUT WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING THAT. AND A SECOND THANK YOU MISTER CUNNINGHAM IN THE MISTER KALRA. YEAH I JUST LIKE TO OFFER SOME PERSPECTIVE FROM A CASE I WORKED ON AT ONE POINT IN TIME AND I APPRECIATE THAT. CONSERVATORSHIP AS OUR TOP FIVE PANEL A FEW OF THEM AND THOSE AND THEY'LL. AND IN MY FORMER LIFE PRACTICING LAW FULL TIME. AND IT'S A DIFFICULT THING TO FOR THE STATE TO DEPRIVE SOMEBODY CELEBRITY [inaudible] YEAH ON USUALLY IT'S UNDER PRETTY COMPELLING CIRCUMSTANCES -- I APPRECIATE THE STRUCTURE AS A PILOT PROGRAM. I DON'T THINK WE DO ENOUGH FOR THAT HERE PERSONALLY. THE COUPLE YEARS I'VE BEEN SERVING HERE. I THINK IT'S VALUABLE TO TRY THINGS OUT ON A MORE LOCALIZED LEVEL. STUDY THEM GATHER SOME DATA GETS EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE ABOUT WORKING HOW CAN BE FIXED. AND THEN THINK ABOUT SCALING IT UP TO THE STATEWIDE LEVEL -- BUT THIS THIS BILL IN. AND WORKING MY WAY THROUGH AND THAT IS THAT. IT I AGREE WITH THE CHAIR IT'S IT'S TOUGH [inaudible] TOUGH VOTE -- MISS SUPPORT IT APPRECIATE THE SENATOR FOR TALKING TO ME. ABOUT AHEAD OF TIME GIVE ME A CHANCE. TO PER ON MY RADAR WORK MY WAY THROUGH IT. BY I HANDLE THE CASE ON THE CIVIL SIDE WHERE. I WAS DEFENDING THE MOM WHO IS SUED FOR NEGLIGENCE SUPERVISION OF OF HER ADULT SON HER ADULT SON HAD BEEN IN THE SYSTEM FIFTY ONE FIFTY NUMEROUS TIMES. I HAD SEVERE SCHIZOPHRENIA -- IT WAS KNOWN -- HE ENDED UP WITH NO PLACE TO GO ANY AND OF BACK IN WITH HER. BECAUSE YOU KNOW [inaudible] ASH'S MOM. AND HE ENDED UP STEALING A FIREARM FROM. I HER GARAGE BECAUSE YOUR HUSBAND PASSED AWAY IN AND WAS LIKE NO -- OWNED A GUN STORE AND SHE INHERITED A BUNCH WEAPONS AND UNFORTUNATELY THEY WEREN'T SECURE VERY WELL. AND HE ENDED UP STEALING ONE OF THE WEAPONS AND A MURDERING HIS NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOR. BECAUSE HE THOUGHT SHE WAS A VAMPIRE -- YOU KNOW. WHEN THEY TALK ABOUT PEOPLE SLIPPING THROUGH THE CRACKS? AND THAT'S THAT'S REAL SO. LET'S DO THIS. THREE OUT WORKS AND THINK IT WAS CUNNINGHAM MISTER KALRA. THANK YOU AS CHAIR AND I APPRECIATE MY COLLEAGUES A MOTIONS ON THIS BECAUSE THIS IS REALLY TOUGH AND IT'S TOUGH FOR EVERYONE INVOLVED AND ON EVERY SIDE. BECAUSE I TRULY SINCERELY BELIEVE I ONCE TRYING TO DO THE RIGHT THING [inaudible] I'M. AND I'M I'M REALLY GRATEFUL UP TO THE AUTHOR. I'D TO WIPE UP CHAIR -- ON THE AMENDMENTS I THINK AS WE HAVE MISTER CHILD THE AMENDMENTS GO A LONG WAY -- IT MAKING IT A MUCH BETTER BILL AND I KNOW THAT -- YOU KNOW THIS IS. BUT AGAIN AS OFTEN TIMES THE CASE YOU'RE TRYING TO THREATEN NEED ALSO AND THIS IS A REALLY TOUGH -- ONE TEND TO TRY TO RECONCILE -- MOVED WITH REALLY DIFFICULT CHALLENGES HAPPENING IN SO MANY CITIES. AROUND OUR STATE I'M. YOU KNOW THE UP OF THE AND TO TOUCH ON SOME OF THE AMENDMENTS I THINK OF REALLY REALLY HELPFUL -- HAVING THAT WORKING GROUP MAKING SURE THAT WE HAD ADVOCATES AT THE TABLE MAKING SURE. THAT EVERYONE -- CAN REALLY MONITOR THIS. VERY CLOSELY IS IS CRITICAL --% BECAUSE NUMBER OF I AGREE WITH THE OVERALL PLAN WHICH I THINK PROBABLY. MOST OF US AGREEMENT THAT NOT ENOUGH HAS BEEN DONE IN THE WHOLE WIDE. ON A WHOLE WIDE RANGE OF ISSUES THAT HAS LED US. TO WHERE WE ARE -- IN AT THE END SO IT'S NOT SPECIFIC TO JUST HOW WE'RE DEALING WITH. POST MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES OR DRUG ADDICTION I'M A IT'S HOW WE'RE DOING WITH POOR PEOPLE IT'S OUR DEALING WITH THE INCOME INEQUALITY AND INEQUITIES AND I KNOW THAT -- YUP SOUNDS A SAM'S CHO HAU COMPOSITION ALL TIME HOW WE CAN GET SOME BY NEIGHBORS TO HELP. US WITH HOUSING IN AND GET THEM TO HELP IN IN DEALING WITH SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT. ARE SOME OF THE BIGGER CITIES ARE JUST REALLY IN A CRISIS MODE -- TRYING TO DEAL WITH -- AND THAT THAT ONE OF THE OTHER THE THE AREAS I THINK THAT YOU KNOW. EIGHT HAVING A PRETTY ONE FIFTY HOLDS IN IN TWELVE MONTHS A LOT. I I CAN THAT REALLY SPEAKS. TO AND THE DEGREE TO WHICH SOMEONE IS REALLY. STRUGGLING TO SURVIVE AND I DO BELIEVE THAT. YOU KNOW THAT THAT THE FACT THAT THIS IS OF ALL LIMITED -- FIVE YEAR OF THE PILOT IS A GOOD THING BUT BECAUSE I WOULD HOPE THAT IT WOULDN'T BE NEEDED AFTER FIVE YEARS. THE OTHERS BECAUSE A SUBSET OF FOLKS THAT. ARE HOMELESS THAT ARE STRUGGLING THAT. IF IN THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS IF WE CAN REALLY GET. THE BULK OF THEM OFF THE STREET AND GET THEM THE HELP THEY NEED. THAT. BUT THIS KIND OF PROGRAM WOULDN'T BE NECESSARY BECAUSE WE CAN REDUCE. THE NUMBERS AND THE AND I WILL NOT REALLY BE KEEN ON LOOKING AT THE DATA -- FROM SAM CISCO. I'VE AND A TO SEE WHAT THE END RESULT IS. IS THIS SOMEONE THAT. RIGHT IS ADAPTED PUBLIC DEFENDER FROM ELEVEN YEARS SPENDING HALF THAT TIME OFTEN ON IN DRUG TREATMENT COURT. OF I HAVE A VISCERAL REACTION TO ANY KIND INVOLUNTARY ATTENTION AND AT THE SAME TIME AS AS SAM MISS CUNNINGHAM OF THEM SPOKE OF HER ARE MANY OCCASIONS. WHERE A HEARTBREAKING OCCASIONS WHERE I WANTED TO DO MORE AND I COULDN'T -- AND I HAD. MANY CLIENTS DIE. THAT MEANS. THAT WHERE ARE THEY PASSED OUT OPEN CASES AND WE CLOSE THEM BECAUSE OF THEIR DEATH -- BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT. WE DON'T TAKE THEIR LIBERTY SERIOUSLY -- BUT GUARD LISTA BUT IT IS GOING ON IN THEIR LIFE. ONE OF THE WORRIES THAT I HAVE THAT ARE CHAIR OF ALLUDED [inaudible] TO IS. A TOOL AND AND FRANKLY YOU KNOW SAM SAYS GO AT A PARTICULARLY HAVING OUR MARILLAC SUPERVISOR LIKE HERE WITH OUR SENATOR. BUT WITH OUR SUMMIT AND BY THE WAY -- AS WAS FOR A FROM A WESTERN CENTER SAID THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS THE STATE NEEDS TO DO THAT WE CAN'T GET ACROSS THE FINISH LINE. BASS NOT THE FAULT OF ANYONE THAT REPRESENTS SAN FRANCISCO. AND IN MOST CASES THEY THE STATE REPRESENTATIVES FROM SAM SAW ONES ARE TRYING TO PUSH -- ON ON STATEWIDE FIXES THAT WE JUST CAN'T. GET DONE BECAUSE OF REPRESENT OTHER BECAUSE JIM WE CAN GET DONE. AND IT'S NOT IT'S NOT THE FAULT OF OF THOSE THAT REPRESENT SAMPRAS'S GO THAT'S FOR SURE -- BUT IT I HAVE SEEN IN SOUNDS AND SOUND GREAT COUNTY SWEEPS THAT DON'T ACCOMPLISH ANYTHING. I OF AND AUTHORITY TO DO SWEEPS THAT DON'T SOLVE THE PROBLEM -- I'M WORRIED THAT THIS TOOL WILL BE USED AS A WEAPON -- AND THAT'S WHY THE OVERSIGHT IS SO CRITICAL. A BETTER DOES TROUBLE ME THAT NO ONE'S HERE FROM LA -- IT WOULD BE NICE TO HEAR BUT THAT THEIR COMMITMENT TO MAKE SURE [inaudible] THAT -- BUT THERE GONNA UPHOLD THE RIGHTS. BUT OF THESE INDIVIDUALS WERE ON THEIR STREETS WE KNOW LA HAS ONE OF THE HAS THE WORST. HOMELESSNESS PROBLEM THAN IN THE NATION. SO I. DEATHLY -- WANT TO DO WHATEVER I CAN TO HELP THEM. BUT THEY HAVE TO GO. AND I DON'T KNOW I DON'T KNOW WHY I KNOW THE FOLKS THAT ARE IS SENSES GO THAT AND THE WORK THAT THEY'RE TRYING TO DO. I'M I DON'T KNOW WHO'S GOING TO BE OVERSEEING THE PROGRAM. AND THE IT AND IS IT GOING TO BE USED AS A WEAPON. I IT WAS JUST ABSENCE GOD I I'D I'D FEEL FAR MORE ACCOUNTABLE TO SING LOOKING TO LET. THAT. THESE NOBLE COLLECTORS DO WHAT THEY CAN AT THE CITY LEVEL. UMMM I KNOW THE TRAUMA BEING BECAUSE NOW LAKE IS IS FAR. GREATER THAN TOO MUCH ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE NATION. UMF GREATER THAN IT IS A SAN JOSE -- AND MANY OTHER PLACES -- BUT I THINK THAT'S THE ONE AREA AT THAT LED. CHAU IS THE MOST IS HOW IS THIS. TOOL GOING TO BE USED -- BUT I DO BELIEVE AS WAS MENTIONED THAT THE AMENDMENTS GO A VERY LONG WAY -- TO PUT ENOUGH PARAMETERS AND PROTECTIONS OF THESE INDIVIDUALS -- AND THAT I AM CONFIDENT THAT OF THE SAN FRANCISCO WILL BE ABLE TO ADD. A MEASURE IT AND AND BRING ALL THE HAPPIEST TOGETHER BOTTOM. ALTHOUGH THE MAJOR PROBLEMS THERE'S AREN'T ENOUGH BEDS THERE'S ON OF HOUSING AND SO EVEN IF YOU CONSERVE SOMEONE BREAKING UP ITEM. I WHICH IS ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT I'VE HAD WITH THAT WITH SWEEPS IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY -- IS THAT THEY SLEEP FOLKS AND THEN THEY JUST. THEIR BY OTHER BACK THERE OR THEY'RE IN ANOTHER NEIGHBORHOOD. I'M YOU KNOW A COUPLE DAYS LATER. AND SO IT THIS IS THE FACT THIS IS FOCUS JUST ON SOME. OF THE OF THE ANOTHER ON A CERTAIN POPULATION OPPOSED HAVE MENTAL THAT REALLY JUST CAN'T CARE FOR THEMSELVES -- IT'S GOOD IN THAT IT'S BUT BUT I WOULD BE WORRIED THAT. OF WHOSE DEFINING THAT AND AND WHO'S USING THIS TOOL. US SOME ANYWAY I'M RAMBLING LITTLE THAT BECAUSE IT IS TOUGH. AND IT'S TOUGH BECAUSE IT'S A BIG DECISION TO TAKE TO GET THIS KIND OF AUTHORITY TO GOVERNMENT. OTHER MATTER WHO IT IS THAT'S IN THAT SEAT RIGHT NOW BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHO'S GOING TO BE IN THAT SEAT TOMORROW AND AND THAT'S WHERE. BECAUSE FOR JOHN TO BUY REALLY APPRECIATE. APPRECIATE YOU SENATOR. AND AND I THINK OUR LEADERS HERE FROM SAMPSON SKULL FOR BEING HERE BEING PRESENT. AND BEING AND COMMITTING THEM TO ENTER. YOUR FOCUS ON HELPING HELPING PEOPLE THAT NEED -- BUT HELP THE MOST. THANK YOU MISTER MEHTA. WHAT'S GONNA SPEAK BUT SINCE I JUST MISSED MY FLIGHT SOME. WHEN I TRY TO MAKE MISTER KALRA MRS TO YOU HAVE AND I'M CAN I'M CARE? NOW I'M GONNA TALK ABOUT THREE HOURS STUFF NOW -- AYE -- AYE FIRST WANNA THANK AS CENTER WINNER FOR BRINGING THIS. I I WORK ON THIS ISSUE -- FOR FOR NUMBER OF YEARS IN A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT CONTEXTS AYE AYE AYE CLERKED. AFTER THE MENTAL HEALTH COURT IN SAN DIEGO. AND WE WORK THESE CASES IS CONSERVATIVE SAYS THEY ARE TOUGH CASES I'M I SAW THE PROTECTIONS THAT WENT INTO IT. AND WHAT WHAT ALL IT TOOK TO TO GET A CONSERVATORSHIP AND AND THE BURDEN IS HIGHS IT SHOULD BE -- AND I THINK PEOPLE STRUGGLED WITH FAT AS TO WHAT'S. IN A KIND OF THEM THE MORE HUMANE APPROACH -- WHEN I BECAME THE HOMELESS COMMISSIONER FOR SENIOR COUNTY? AND FOCUSED REALLY -- REALLY HEAVILY ON THE CHRONIC HOMELESS. AND I HAD -- AT ACTUALLY THIRTY EIGHT AND MIGHT KIND OF DIRECT CASELOAD A FEW WELL. THIRTY EIGHT TOUGHEST INCENTIVE CAO. THREE MOST SERIOUSLY MEANT TO HER PERCENT HAD SERIOUS MENTAL. SCHIZOPHRENIA LIKE MERRELL ACCENT -- AND IT IT WAS DIFFICULT WAS DIFFICULT GETTING THEM AND HOUSING SERVICES BY THE WAY WE GOT A MALL AND BUT I FELT FROM COME FROM SPENDING ALL THOSE YEARS CHINA FROM GOING OUT ON THE STREET. MYSELF NOT SEEN IN AN OFFICE TALKING ABOUT UP A GLANCE YOU MYSELF. AND TALKING TO THESE HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS TRYING TO PERSUADE THEM TO COME IN AND GET SERVICES AND GET HOUSING. IT WAS AN UNBELIEVABLY DIFFICULT TASK BECAUSE AS AS YOU'D SAID HOW MARILYN. SOME DAYS WERE REALLY GOOD DAYS. AND WE HAVE THESE RATIONAL. RELATIVELY RATIONAL IS SORT OF FOR REMOVING DISCUSSIONS AND THEN THE NEXT DAY WOULD BE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT NUMBER. ONE THAT -- WHAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON FOR ALMOST A YEAR? AND AMERICAN BACK IN AND HE HE DIDN'T RECOGNIZE ME NURSING YOU NOT IT'S BEEN A YEAR OF THIS -- AND DIDN'T KNOW WHO I WAS. AND IT YOU KNOW IT SHAKES UP A LITTLE BIT YOU KNOW AND IT REALLY MAKES YOU REALIZE THE LEVEL OF STRUGGLE THAT WE ALL ARE GOING TO HAVE IN OUR OWN JURISDICTIONS IN OUR OWN CITIES. AND COUNTIES ON THIS TOPIC I CAME TO THE CONCLUSION FROM THAT -- THAT I THOUGHT -- PROVIDING CONSERVATIVE FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS WAS A MORE HUMANE APPROACH THAT THAT BECAME MY OPINION AND I GET WHY SOME PEOPLE. MAY NOT ALWAYS SHARE BUT I FELT LIKE THE ONLY WAY WE COULD. AND WAS IT AND BY THE WAY IT WAS THE ONLY TIME IN SAN DIEGO'S HISTORY AT LEAST WE HAVE SUCCESSFUL HOMELESS PROGRAM. AND WAS THAT NOW GRANTED AND THAT WAS WHAT BY THE WAY THAT WAS WITHOUT THAT. BUT I THOUGHT. BECAUSE WE WE WE DIDN'T END UP HAVING TO USE A CONSERVER SHIPS BUT I THOUGHT THE ONLY WAY REALLY TO GET PAST. FOR THE NUMBER I DON'T HATE. AND GET TARA THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY EIGHT WHEN. FIVE HUNDRED AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO AT SOME POINT START MAKING USE SIR MAKING A BETTER USE OF THE CONSERVATORSHIP SYSTEM THAT WASN'T REALLY BEING USED -- SORT OF WELL. SO -- I AM DESPERATE THIS DAY I AND MY BELIEF IT WILL WORK. ON CANNELLA FORCING THE PILOT PROGRAM RESULTS -- YOU KNOW. AT I WISH SANDY LAND MORMON INTEREST IN THAT OF I GUESS ONLY MY COMMENTS TO THAT -- BUT I'M A FRUSTRATED ON THAT FAUSTO HOMELESS COMMISSIONER WE BI PARTISAN PILOT PROGRAM I PROMISE YOU -- BUT IN A VAT HAPPY TO SUPPORT THIS TODAY THANKS FOR BRINGING AT THANKS FOR YOUR WORK ON THIS. THANK YOU OF ISRAELI SETTLEMENTS MCCARTY. I THINK EVERYTHING THAT'S GOOD ABOUT IT HAS ALREADY BEEN DISCUSSED. I I I WANT TO ADDRESS THE OPPOSITION AND I REALLY WANT TO THANK YOU. BECAUSE WHENEVER OR WORKING ON ANY KIND OF A PROGRAM THAT GOES. BEYOND WHAT WE WOULD LIKE THAT THAT. KIND OF MAKES US FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE IT'S SO GOOD TO HEAR THE OPPOSITION TO REMIND US WHY WE FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE. WHY IT IS WE HAVE TO PROTECT THOSE CIVIL LIBERTIES WHY IT IS THAT WE HAVE TO TAKE HAVE THE THE THE GROUP'S THAT -- THERE THAT THE STAKE HOLDERS ARE GOING TO BE PRESENT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE ALL OF THOSE SAFEGUARDS. I REALLY APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE. EVEN THOUGH AS YOU MENTIONED EARLIER THAT TO TALK TO OUR OFFICES AND YOU KNEW HOW THE VOTE WAS GOING TO GO. BUT YOU ALSO KNOW YOU YOU KNOW US AND YOU KNOW THE SORTS OF THINGS THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO US. SO I DO WANT TO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING THERE FOR BEING THE VOICE. THAT HAS TO BE THERE TO REMIND US ABOUT THAT BALANCE BUT IT CLEARLY I WILL BE SUPPORTING. THE BILL THANK SENATOR. IF YOU MISSED MCCARTY THANK YOU AND I KNOW THIS COMMITTEE IS LOOKING AT THE JUDICIARY ISSUES AND I'M A SUB TODAY -- BUT WE DID HEAR THIS IN THE HEALTH COMMITTEE AT A COUPLE DAYS AGO AND I I SUPPORT THIS IT IT'S HARD AND I KNOW. IT'S A BALANCING ACT BETWEEN ADDRESSING HOMELESSNESS ADDICTION MENTAL HEALTH. AND PEOPLE'S GOD GIVEN RIGHTS TO TO LIVE THEIR LIVES. AND I'M JUST AT A COUPLE OBSERVATIONS I KNOW THAT IN THE HEALTH COMMITTEE WITH IT WAS TIGHTENED UP. AND AND EVEN MORE SO -- TODAY BUT BUT YESTERDAY CURRENT AND HEALTHCARE TODAY'S AGO NEVER WAS. SENATOR YOU DISCUSSED OTHER JURISDICTIONS -- NOT HAVING THE OPPORTUNITY AND THAT WAS THE MANTHAT YOU TOOK IN THE SENATE WITH SENATOR HANNAH BETH JACKSON. I WISH WE DID HAVE AN OPT IN -- OPPORTUNITY FOR COUNTIES AND AND LIKE YOU SAID DISTRICT CARE THE THE THRESHOLDS TO SHOW THAT THEY DO HAVE THE SUPPORT SERVICES AND THEY'RE GOING TO THE STEPS ARE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT AYE I WISH COUNTIES COULD OPT IN. AND SHOW THAT THEY'RE FOLLOWING THOSE STEPS IF NOT. IT WOULD IT WOULD NOT BE AN OPTION FOR THE AND THERE CAN BE SOME ACTION TAKEN AGAINST HIM FOR NOT FOLLOWING THROUGH AND YOU KNOW WE ALL TALK ABOUT PERSONAL STORIES JUST LAST NIGHT I SAW SOMEBODY ON MY STREET. GOING THROUGH TRASH CANS WHO KNOCKED ON DOORS FOR MY CAMPAIGN. I KNOW THIS PERSON. HOMELESS MOTHER MENTAL ILLNESS METH ADDICT PSYCHOSIS I THOUGHT. I WOULD LIKE TO THAT HER FAMILY WOULD LIKE TO GET HER. IN A PROGRAM. SHE KEEPS SAYING NO IT'S BEEN IN AND OUT OF HOSPITAL. I DON'T THINK SHE SHE MEETS THIS THESE THRESHOLDS. AND WE NEED TO WORK ON HELPING KNOWS BUT DOUBLING THE AMOUNT OF TIMES TO COME UNDERSTANDING FOR YOUR AMENDMENTS AND THEN FROM. FOUR TO EIGHT IS THAT CORRECT HAVING TO GO THROUGH. SOME OF THAT THAT SERIOUS -- SITUATIONS -- I THINK YOU KNOW THOSE ARE CASES THAT WE SEE ON A REGULAR BASIS OUR COMMUNITY AND IT IT TAKES A SERIOUSNESS THAT THIS. TOOL IS USED. AND AND I THINK IT MAKES SENSE AND AND I I WANT FOR ONE WANT. TO ADVOCATE THAT WE OPEN UP AND ALLOW COUNTIES DOCTRINE AND OTHER BORDER SUPERVISORS GO THROUGH A PUBLIC HEARING PROCESS AND PROVE THAT THEY HAVE ALL THESE ELEMENTS LIKE THE OTHER. GUYS ARE DOING BECAUSE IT'S NOT JUST. SAM JUST GO IN SACRAMENTO I MEAN IT LA YOU'D WALK AROUND HERE IN SACRAMENTO SEASON PEOPLE FOR YOURSELF. AND I KNOW THAT DOESN'T GET US OFF THE HOOK FOR DRESSING WITH. MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND HOMELESSNESS IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING WE'D GO OF THREE THOSE WELL BUT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I THINK THAT WE CAN IGNORE AS WELL THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE SOLD. THANK YOU I I WON'T REPEAT EVERYTHING THAT WAS SAID BECAUSE I THINK YOU'RE. CERTAINLY DEMONSTRATED SENATOR BY YOUR A COMMITMENT ON A WHOLE HOST OF A LEGISLATION THAT -- YOUR HEART IS DESIGNED TO FOCUS ON THE NEEDS OF INDIVIDUALS AND TO TRY TO UP LIFT THEM UP TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE. RECEIVING ALL THE PRO -- SERVICES THAT -- THAT CAN BE MADE AVAILABLE -- I AND MISTER CHALLEN I REPRESENT LOS ANGELES COUNTY. SO WE CAN'T EXPLAIN WHY LA COUNTY ARE HERE TODAY. BUT WE WILL MAKE OUR SPECIAL EFFORTS TO COMMUNICATE. OUGHT TO THE LEADERSHIP AT THE COUNTY LEVEL. OF WHAT THE EXPECTATIONS ARE OF THE COMMITTEE -- AND TO ALSO COMMUNICATE ARTISTS -- APPOINTMENT THE FACT IT. THEY DID NOT SEND SOMEONE HERE TODAY TO REPRESENT THE COUNTY APPROPRIATELY -- SO I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL. AND I WILL COMPLEMENT OF THE MAYOR ELECT ON HER ASAP FOR CISCO GIANT COLORS THIS SEASON PURPORTING PROBABLY TODAY-- O. CHEN. AND AND THAT WILL NOT KEEP ME FROM. BUT VOTER THROUGHOUT OFTEN. REPRESENTING THE DODGERS THANK YOU [inaudible] NOTICE [inaudible] ALRIGHT. IT IN AND I WILL KNOW THAT. SENATOR STERN IS -- A JOINT AUTHORED THAT HE ASKED THAT LA BE IN IT. BUT WE HAVE HEARD THAT MUCH FROM LOS ANGELES I'M NOT SURE HOW MUCH THEY WANT TO TAKE IT ADVANTAGE OF THIS BUT IF THEY DO. AGAIN SINCE IT IS A PILOT PROGRAM THAT IS UP TO US. TO TO KEEP TRACK OF I THANK YOU. SENATOR YOU BECAUSE A COLLEAGUE THANK YOU VERY MUCH I THIS IS NOW THE FIFTH TIME THAT I'VE PRESENTED THE SPELLING COMMITTEE ALL WITHOUT MY FRIENDS HERE REALLY GO. WELL I GOT YOU KNOW REALLY GOING THROUGH WE GO AROUND TOGETHER AND WE DEBATED SOUTHERN AND AND IT'S ALL GOOD BECAUSE THEY ARE NORMALLY ALLIES ON EVERYTHING -- BUT I THIS WOODSTOCK I AM BY FAR -- THE MOST THOROUGH AND THOUGHTFUL DISCUSSION AND I ARE AN IMPERSONAL BECAUSE ULTIMATELY THIS IS ABOUT OUR THERE'S ABOUT PEOPLE. AND ARE AND THE PEOPLE WHO ARE. IN DEEP CRISIS AND I KNOW I KNOW I KNOW THAT TO EMOTIONAL. FOR A LOT OF US WE ALL LIVE IN NEIGHBORHOODS THEIR PEOPLE I SEE IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD IN THE CASTRO IN SAN FRANCISCO. WHO OVER YEARS I SEE THEM TO THE CLIENT IN THE CLIMB DECLINE IN THERE? ONE DAY THEY'RE NOT THERE ANYMORE I DON'T KNOW. TRIED TO GET HELP HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO AND THEY'RE GONE. I AND THIS IS A HUMAN -- TRAGEDY THAT PLAYS OUT EVERYDAY NOT JUST IN SAN FRANCISCO AND LA BUT IN SACRAMENTO IN FRESNO. AN ORANGE COUNTY AND REALLY EVERYWHERE IN OUR STATE OUR AND I DO THINK TRYING SOMETHING. ADDITIONAL TOOL AS A PILOT PROGRAM I WILL MAKE SENSE I I WANNA SAY WITH RESPECT TO LOS ANGELES I MISTER CHAIRMAN YOU'RE CORRECT THAT SENATOR STERN. HERE'S MY JOINT AUTHORED ON THE BILL AYE HE'S BEEN INVOLVED FROM THE BEGINNING ARGUE WITH THEM THEY WOULD BE HERE TODAY BECAUSE OF OTHER BILL PRESENTATIONS.

A HUGE OF FUNDING ARE MEASURE FOR HOUSING OF FOR HOMELESS PEOPLE AND I KNOW THAT ASSEMBLYMAN CHU HAS A BILL TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT MONEY ACTUALLY CAN GET SPENT IMPLEMENTED. AYE SO I DO I AM CONFIDENT THAT LA IS COMMITTED LIKE SAN FRANCISCO TO IMPLEMENTING THE BILL WHILE OTHER ARE OTHER COUNTIES THAT ARE INTERESTED IN WE'VE BEEN HEARING ABOUT THAT AND I CAN BE AN ONGOING DISCUSSION. I YOU KNOW I THINK OF THE OPPOSITION MADE UP POINT IN AND EACH OF THESE INDIVIDUALS LIVES. ARE THEY WERE. OUT. THERE WAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO HELP THEM IN A MUCH LESS RESTRICTIVE Y..
