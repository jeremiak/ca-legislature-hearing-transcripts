TREATMENT BY SIX MONTHS OF AGE.

00:13:16.996 --> 00:13:19.098
CALIFORNIA DOES A BEAUTIFUL JOB

00:13:19.165 --> 00:13:20.466
IN SCREENING AND IDENTIFYING

00:13:20.533 --> 00:13:22.234

00:13:23.836 --> 00:13:25.638
WHEN IT COMES TO TREATING THEM I

00:13:25.704 --> 00:13:27.406
SEE THIS EVERY DAY WHEN I TAKE

00:13:27.473 --> 00:13:28.908

00:13:31.610 --> 00:13:32.811
HEARING AID MAKES ANALYZE AND

00:13:32.878 --> 00:13:34.013

THE ACA REQUIRES A STATE TO

MILLION DOLLARS.

00:20:39.404 --> 00:20:40.472
AND THIS IS JUST SIMPLY THE

00:20:40.539 --> 00:20:44.109
WRONG TIME TO PASS NEW MANDATES --

00:20:44.176 --> 00:20:45.410
SEVERAL BENEFIT MANDATES HAVE

00:20:45.477 --> 00:20:46.778

00:20:59.725 --> 00:21:00.926
MY INSURANCE MARKET.

00:21:00.993 --> 00:21:02.427
THE TOTALITY OF MANDATES BEFORE

00:21:02.494 --> 00:21:04.696
THE LEGISLATURE EQUALS MORE THAN

00:21:04.763 --> 00:21:05.263
EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION

00:21:05.330 --> 00:21:06.398
DOLLARS THIS YEAR.

00:21:06.465 --> 00:21:07.833
THE COST OF THE MONTHLY PREMIUM

00:21:07.899 --> 00:21:10.235
AS THE PRIMARY CONSIDERATION FOR

00:21:10.302 --> 00:21:11.536
CONSUMERS WHEN SELECTING A PLAN.

00:21:11.603 --> 00:21:13.138
THUS FAR CALIFORNIA HAS DONE A

00:21:13.205 --> 00:21:14.272
BETTER JOB COMPARED TO MOST

00:21:14.339 --> 00:21:15.707

MAINTAINING A FOR A PREMIUMS AS

00:21:21.713 --> 00:21:23.248
CRITICAL AS POLICY MAKERS STRIVE

00:21:23.315 --> 00:21:24.016
TO DECREASE THE NUMBER OF

00:21:24.082 --> 00:21:26.218
UNINSURED IN CALIFORNIA.

00:21:26.284 --> 00:21:27.419
THIS IS NOT THE TIME FOR NEW

00:21:27.486 --> 00:21:30.155
BENEFIT MANDATES THAT DRIVE UP

00:21:30.222 --> 00:21:31.356
THE COST OF CARE. FOR THESE

00:21:31.423 --> 00:21:32.791
REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE

00:21:32.858 --> 00:21:33.659
THIS BILL.

LIFE AND HEALTH INSURANCE

00:21:40.565 --> 00:21:42.567
COMPANIES UNFORTUNATELY WE ARE

00:21:42.634 --> 00:21:44.269
TO HEAR TODAY IN OPPOSITION I

00:21:44.336 --> 00:21:45.470
THINK EVERYONE AT THIS TABLE

00:21:45.537 --> 00:21:46.972
INCLUDING EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM

00:21:47.039 --> 00:21:48.640
IS SYMPATHETIC TO THIS ISSUE.

00:21:48.707 --> 00:21:50.609
UNFORTUNATELY THIS WAS NOT A

00:21:50.676 --> 00:21:52.344
PART OF THE ORIGINAL BENCHMARK

00:21:52.411 --> 00:21:53.578
PLAN THAT WAS CHOSEN BY THE

00:21:53.645 --> 00:21:55.047
LEGISLATURE.

00:21:55.113 --> 00:21:57.649
IT WILL BE RE AUTHORIZED -- NEXT

00:21:57.716 --> 00:21:58.984
YEAR AND WE WOULD SUGGEST THAT

00:21:59.051 --> 00:22:00.919
THAT MAY BE A BETTER OPPORTUNITY

00:22:00.986 --> 00:22:01.953
TO HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT

00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:03.388
WHETHER OR NOT.

00:22:03.455 --> 00:22:05.157
THE INITIAL KAISER THIRTY PLUS

00:22:05.223 --> 00:22:06.658
PLAN SHOULD BE THE BENCHMARK OR

00:22:06.725 --> 00:22:07.993
WE SHOULD CONSIDER ALTERNATIVE

00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:10.095
OPTIONS THAT DO COVER OTHER

00:22:10.162 --> 00:22:11.830
BENEFITS BUT UNFORTUNATELY AS

00:22:11.897 --> 00:22:12.531
THIS.

00:22:12.597 --> 00:22:14.700
BILL WOULD EXCEEDS THE H. PIECES

00:22:14.766 --> 00:22:16.968
WOULD BE ADDITIONAL STATE COST

00:22:17.035 --> 00:22:18.470
TO THE SYSTEM AT A TIME WHEN

00:22:18.537 --> 00:22:20.172
WE'RE LOOKING AT IMPOSING AN

00:22:20.238 --> 00:22:21.640
INDIVIDUAL MANDATE.

00:22:21.707 --> 00:22:23.375
AT THE CALIFORNIA LEVEL AND ALSO

00:22:23.442 --> 00:22:24.976
LOOKING AT INCREASING SUBSIDIES

00:22:25.043 --> 00:22:26.478
TO HELP PEOPLE AFFORD THEIR

00:22:26.545 --> 00:22:27.579
CURRENT HEALTHCARE.

00:22:27.646 --> 00:22:28.880
WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT ADDING

00:22:28.947 --> 00:22:30.015
ADDITIONAL COSTS THAT WOULD

00:22:30.082 --> 00:22:31.483
IMPACT THE GREATER CONSUMER

00:22:31.550 --> 00:22:33.518

TIMELY FASHION -- THIS IS TOO

00:24:41.913 --> 00:24:43.982
IMPORTANT AN ISSUE FOR THESE

YOUNG CHILDREN INFANTS IN MANY

WANT TO HIGHLIGHT A FEW CRITICAL

00:44:14.485 --> 00:44:15.285
THINGS THAT I THINK ARE

00:44:15.352 --> 00:44:16.153
IMPORTANT.

00:44:16.220 --> 00:44:18.122
I SUPPORT A SIMILAR BILL LAST

00:44:18.188 --> 00:44:19.556

00:44:25.062 --> 00:44:28.499
THIS BILL ESTABLISHES A RATIO OF

00:44:28.565 --> 00:44:29.133
ONE FOR FOUR HUNDRED I GUESS THE

00:44:29.199 --> 00:44:30.501
DIFFERENCES IN THE TWO BILLS NO

00:44:30.567 --> 00:44:32.202
SHOW WE REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT

00:44:32.269 --> 00:44:33.771
THE APPROPRIATE RATIO IS IN MY

00:44:33.837 --> 00:44:36.440
MIND -- AND TO BE THAT WE SHOULD

00:44:36.507 --> 00:44:37.841
HAVE TO ENSURE EFFECTIVE

00:44:37.908 --> 00:44:39.543

00:44:41.078 --> 00:44:42.546
I THINK WE NEED TO STEP BACK AND

00:44:42.613 --> 00:44:44.081
AND LOOK AT THE RELATIONSHIP

00:44:44.148 --> 00:44:48.252
BETWEEN SCHOOLS.

00:44:48.318 --> 00:44:49.453

WORKING WHAT ISN'T WORKING AND

00:44:50.754 --> 00:44:51.855
AND THEN FIGURE OUT HOW TO PAY

00:44:51.922 --> 00:44:54.024
FOR IT WHICH IS ALSO CRITICAL --

00:44:54.091 --> 00:44:55.559
AND RATHER THAN ESTABLISHING A

00:44:55.626 --> 00:44:57.928
RATIO STATE LAW BUT I I I WANT

00:44:57.995 --> 00:44:58.729

00:44:58.796 --> 00:44:59.563

00:44:59.630 --> 00:45:01.932
I ALSO WILL SAY THAT I HAVE I

00:45:01.999 --> 00:45:03.834
HAVE CONCERNS AROUND WORKFORCE --

00:45:03.901 --> 00:45:07.704

00:45:10.474 --> 00:45:11.575
WORK WITH CHILDREN.

00:45:11.642 --> 00:45:13.544
NOW WE'RE GOING TO BE ASKING FOR

00:45:13.610 --> 00:45:14.878
MORE AND MORE TO BE IN SCHOOLS

00:45:14.945 --> 00:45:16.914

00:48:49.493 --> 00:48:51.295
THIS PROGRAM IS JUST SCRATCHING

00:48:51.361 --> 00:48:52.696
THE SURFACE OF ITS POTENTIAL AS

00:48:52.763 --> 00:48:53.764

LONG TERM SERVICES AND SUPPORTS

00:49:01.171 --> 00:49:03.040
A CONTINUUM OF CARE BUT GIVEN

00:49:03.106 --> 00:49:04.808
THAT SAN FRANCISCO HAS LOST 34%

00:49:04.875 --> 00:49:06.043

00:49:07.744 --> 00:49:09.579
WAS RESIDENTIAL CARE FACILITIES

FOR THE ELDERLY SINCE TWO

00:49:11.081 --> 00:49:11.581
THOUSAND TWELVE IT BEGS THE

00:49:11.648 --> 00:49:12.849
QUESTION OF WHETHER WE TRULY

00:49:12.916 --> 00:49:14.284
HAVE A CONTINUUM OF CARE.

00:49:14.351 --> 00:49:15.485
THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THAT

00:49:15.552 --> 00:49:16.753
FROM A MEDI CAL FUNDING

00:49:16.820 --> 00:49:18.188
PERSPECTIVE THERE IS NO TRUE

00:49:18.255 --> 00:49:20.290
CONTINUE ON WHAT WE HAVE INSTEAD

00:49:20.357 --> 00:49:21.725
IS A PATCHWORK OF SERVICES.

00:49:21.792 --> 00:49:22.859
ON ONE HAND WE HAVE A PROGRAM

00:49:22.926 --> 00:49:24.227

FOR CHRONICALLY HOMELESS THAT'S

00:49:27.397 --> 00:49:28.298
A VERY DIFFICULT SERVICE TO

00:49:28.899 --> 00:49:30.267
ON THE OTHER HAND WE HAVE

00:49:30.334 --> 00:49:31.702
INSTITUTIONAL SETTING SUCH AND

00:49:31.768 --> 00:49:33.270
SUCH A SNIFFS AND IN BETWEEN

00:49:33.337 --> 00:49:34.838
THESE TWO WE HAVE A GAPING HOLE

00:49:34.905 --> 00:49:36.106
THAT THE ALE W. WAS TRYING TO

00:49:36.173 --> 00:49:38.642
FILL WITH A MEAGER 500-070-0404

00:49:38.709 --> 00:49:40.110
SLOTS. TO PUT THAT IN

00:49:40.177 --> 00:49:41.311
PERSPECTIVE THAT JUST REPRESENTS

00:49:41.378 --> 00:49:42.879
2% OF THE TOTAL CAPACITY OF

00:49:42.946 --> 00:49:44.614

ADULTS AND SKILLED NURSING BEDS

00:49:46.917 --> 00:49:47.451
HENCE THE GAPING HOLE IN OUR

00:49:47.517 --> 00:49:49.386
SYSTEM. FOR PERSONS LIVING IN A

00:49:49.453 --> 00:49:51.054
BOARDING CARE ON SS I SS BE

00:49:51.121 --> 00:49:52.189
FUNDING IS LIMITED TO THE NON

MEDICAL OUT OF HOME CARE RATE

00:49:53.724 --> 00:49:55.092
WHICH IS ONE THOUSAND FIFTY

00:49:55.158 --> 00:49:55.859
EIGHT DOLLARS PER MONTH OR

00:49:55.926 --> 00:49:57.461
ROUGHLY THIRTY FIVE DOLLARS PER

00:49:57.527 --> 00:49:58.328
DAY.

00:49:58.395 --> 00:49:59.363
YOU CAN'T AFFORD A ROACH

00:49:59.429 --> 00:50:01.631
INFESTED MOTEL FOR THIRTY FIVE

00:50:01.698 --> 00:50:02.799
DOLLARS PER DAY THE BOARDING

00:50:02.866 --> 00:50:03.934
TEARS ARE SUPPOSED TO PROVIDE

00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:05.569
HOUSING UTILITIES.

00:50:05.635 --> 00:50:07.537
FOOD STAFF TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE

00:50:07.604 --> 00:50:09.539
WITH ACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIVING

00:50:09.606 --> 00:50:11.141
AS WELL AS MEDICATION MANAGEMENT.

00:50:11.208 --> 00:50:12.609
OF A BOARDING CARE HAS SIX

00:50:12.676 --> 00:50:14.411
RESIDENTS ALL ON SS I SS P. AND

00:50:14.478 --> 00:50:15.579
HAVE TO CONTEND WITH THE MINIMUM

00:50:15.645 --> 00:50:16.980
WAGE OF THIRTEEN TWENTY FIVE OR

00:50:17.047 --> 00:50:18.148
MORE IT WOULD BE MATHEMATICALLY

00:50:18.215 --> 00:50:19.616
IMPOSSIBLE TO FULLY PAY STAFF

00:50:19.683 --> 00:50:20.617
MINIMUM WAGE.

00:50:20.684 --> 00:50:22.252
MUCH LESS PAY FOR PAYROLL TAXES

00:50:22.319 --> 00:50:23.887
WORKERS COMP INSURANCE LIABILITY

00:50:23.954 --> 00:50:25.389
INSURANCE PROPERTY TAXES AND

00:50:25.455 --> 00:50:26.123
MORE.

00:50:26.189 --> 00:50:27.391
IT SHOULDN'T BE A SURPRISE AND

00:50:27.457 --> 00:50:29.059
TO SEE THE RATE AT WHICH SAN

00:50:29.126 --> 00:50:30.427
FRANCISCO LOSING BOARDING CARES

00:50:30.494 --> 00:50:32.396
OR THE LA COUNTY HAS LOST OVER

00:50:32.462 --> 00:50:36.199
ONE THOUSAND A. R. F. BEDS OVER

00:50:36.266 --> 00:50:37.067
THE LAST TWENTY FOUR MONTHS.

00:50:37.134 --> 00:50:37.934
SO WHY SHOULD WE CARE ABOUT

00:50:38.001 --> 00:50:38.568
THESE HOMES CLOSING WHILE THESE

00:50:38.635 --> 00:50:39.436
LOSSES COME DISPLACEMENT OF MANY

00:50:39.503 --> 00:50:41.071
LOW INCOME ADULTS THERE ARE

00:50:41.138 --> 00:50:41.872
SUFFERING FROM SEVERE MENTAL

00:50:41.938 --> 00:50:43.407
ILLNESS PUTTING THEM AT RISK OF

00:50:43.473 --> 00:50:45.275
INSTITUTIONALIZATION OR WORSE

00:50:45.342 --> 00:50:46.476
YET HOMELESSNESS.

00:50:46.543 --> 00:50:47.978
OF A CONTINUUM OF CARE IS TRULY

00:50:48.044 --> 00:50:49.279
TO WORK IT SHOULD HELP PROVIDE

00:50:49.346 --> 00:50:50.847
THE RIGHT HOUSING AND THE RIGHT

00:50:50.914 --> 00:50:52.382
CARE AT THE RIGHT TIME.

00:50:52.449 --> 00:50:53.917
WE CAN'T DISENTANGLE HOUSING

00:50:53.984 --> 00:50:55.886
FROM HEALTH AS HOUSING OR A LACK

00:50:55.952 --> 00:50:57.654
LACK THERE OF HAS A DIRECT

00:50:57.721 --> 00:50:59.022
IMPACT ON HEALTH.

00:50:59.089 --> 00:50:59.890
THE REASON WHY THESE HOMES ARE

00:50:59.956 --> 00:51:01.591
SO IMPORTANT AND WORTH SAVING IS

00:51:01.658 --> 00:51:02.692
BECAUSE THEY SAID AT THE VERY

00:51:02.759 --> 00:51:05.095
INTERSECTION OF HOUSING AND CARE.

00:51:05.162 --> 00:51:06.363
WHAT WE'RE SEEING NOW HOWEVER IS

00:51:06.430 --> 00:51:07.130
THAT THESE HOMES CAN'T BE

00:51:07.197 --> 00:51:09.533
ACCESSED EFFECTIVELY FOR THAT

00:51:09.599 --> 00:51:10.434
ONE THOUSAND FIFTY EIGHT A MONTH?

00:51:10.500 --> 00:51:12.169

01:07:42.391 --> 01:07:44.460
THAT TRAUMA IS PERVASIVE ASSUMED

01:07:44.527 --> 01:07:46.195

01:08:05.181 --> 01:08:07.016
TWO HUNDRED YOUNG PEOPLE -- WHO

01:08:07.082 --> 01:08:08.384
TALK TO THEIR PEERS ABOUT THEIR

01:08:08.451 --> 01:08:09.985
PRIMARY COPING STRATEGY WHICH

01:08:10.052 --> 01:08:12.054
WAS SMOKING WEED ONE OF THE MOST

01:08:12.121 --> 01:08:13.656
PAINFUL AND PROFOUND THINGS WE

01:08:13.722 --> 01:08:14.757
HEARD WAS THAT?

01:08:14.824 --> 01:08:17.359
YOUNG PEOPLE SHARE THE RISK OF

01:08:17.426 --> 01:08:18.494
GETTING CAUGHT WITH MARIJUANA.

01:08:18.561 --> 01:08:20.262
FELT LESS HARMFUL THAN THE RISK

01:08:20.329 --> 01:08:21.664
OF TRYING TO ACCESS AN ADULT WHO

01:08:21.730 --> 01:08:25.734
COULD HELP.

01:08:25.801 --> 01:08:28.103
SO THIS ATMOSPHERIC DISTRESS IS

01:08:28.170 --> 01:08:29.538
REFLECTED IN REINFORCED THROUGH

01:08:29.605 --> 01:08:31.073

RESPONSIBLE FOR THEM.

01:08:35.911 --> 01:08:37.046
SO RISE WE WORK WITH YOUNG

01:08:37.112 --> 01:08:38.714
PEOPLE WHO EXPERIENCE LEGAL

HOLES IN THEM AS NON COMPLIANT --

01:08:50.893 --> 01:08:52.061
ACTING AS BABIES.

01:08:52.127 --> 01:08:53.095
WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH PUBLIC

SAFETY AND SOCIAL SERVICE

01:08:54.430 --> 01:08:56.165
SYSTEMS THAT HOLD THEM CULPABLE

01:08:56.232 --> 01:08:57.633
FOR THEIR INJURY AND THEN LACK

RIGHTFULLY AND LEGALLY BEARS.

01:09:02.972 --> 01:09:04.240
SO WHEN WE ASK YOUNG PEOPLE WHAT

THEY NEEDED THE MOST RESPOND

01:09:06.041 --> 01:09:07.943
RESOUNDING RESPONSE WAS THE NEED

01:09:08.010 --> 01:09:09.678

01:09:13.716 --> 01:09:14.950
THEY SAID THEY NEED ADULTS AND

01:09:15.017 --> 01:09:16.719
SYSTEMS WHO CAN PROVIDE GUIDANCE

01:09:16.785 --> 01:09:19.188

GONNA AUTHOR IT.

01:39:46.013 --> 01:39:47.614
BUT I WOULD JUST TELL YOU THAT

01:40:00.294 --> 01:40:02.062
COUPLE OF THINGS THAT I'VE I

01:40:02.129 --> 01:40:03.263
THINK ARE IMPORTANT.

01:40:03.330 --> 01:40:04.732
WHEN WE WENT TO THE AGING

01:40:04.798 --> 01:40:09.069
COMMITTEE -- ONE OF THE MEMBERS.

01:40:09.136 --> 01:40:10.003
VEHEMENTLY I MEAN HE WAS SO

01:40:10.070 --> 01:40:11.739
STRONGLY IN SUPPORT OF THIS BUT

01:40:11.805 --> 01:40:13.640
HE SAYS YOU'VE GOT TO INCLUDE

01:40:13.707 --> 01:40:15.242
VETERANS.

01:40:15.309 --> 01:40:16.944
WITH THE HIGH SUICIDE RATES IN

01:40:17.010 --> 01:40:19.947
THE PTSD SITUATION YOU KNOW WITH

01:40:20.013 --> 01:40:21.648
VETERANS AND WHATNOT THEY NEED

01:40:21.715 --> 01:40:23.851
TO BE INCLUDED NOW CONSIDER THAT

01:40:23.917 --> 01:40:25.519
SOME OF OUR NOT IT NECESSARILY

01:40:25.586 --> 01:40:26.220
OLD.

01:40:26.286 --> 01:40:27.621
HERE THEY MAYBE FROM MORE

01:40:27.688 --> 01:40:30.424
COURAGE -- SITUATIONS BUT THEY

01:40:30.491 --> 01:40:32.693
STILL HAVE THE NEED FOR THESE

01:40:32.760 --> 01:40:37.164
SERVICES -- I SEE AN OPPORTUNITY

01:40:37.231 --> 01:40:38.432
TO ENGAGE AND ENCOURAGE

01:40:38.499 --> 01:40:40.901
STATEWIDE ORGANIZATIONS INTER

01:40:40.968 --> 01:40:43.237
PROVIDING INNOVATIVE AND

01:40:43.303 --> 01:40:44.705
CREATIVE PROGRAMS.

01:40:44.772 --> 01:40:45.973
THAT AT THAT ADDRESS SOME OF

01:40:46.039 --> 01:40:48.375
THEIR SPECIFIC ISSUES.

01:40:48.442 --> 01:40:50.344
THESE INNOVATIVE PROGRAMS CAN

01:40:50.411 --> 01:40:52.079
AND SHOULD BE BROUGHT TO THE

01:40:52.146 --> 01:40:54.348
ATTENTION OF OTHER AGENCIES FOR

01:40:54.415 --> 01:40:56.750
POSSIBLE IMPLEMENTATION.

01:40:56.817 --> 01:40:58.452
THIS IS WHERE I THINK ADVISORY

01:40:58.519 --> 01:41:00.053
BODIES SHOULD HAVE REGIONAL

01:41:00.120 --> 01:41:03.090
REPRESENTATION IN ADDITION TO

01:41:03.157 --> 01:41:04.425
STATE ORGANIZATIONS.

01:41:04.491 --> 01:41:07.127
SEEMS LIKE IF HE COUNTIES AROUND

01:41:07.194 --> 01:41:08.862
THE STATE HAVE BUILT SILOS

01:41:08.929 --> 01:41:11.331
AROUND WHAT THEY DO AND DON'T

01:41:11.398 --> 01:41:13.200
NECESSARILY SHARE WHAT THEY DO

01:41:13.267 --> 01:41:14.468
WITH OTHERS AND THERE'S A

01:41:14.535 --> 01:41:16.136
POSSIBILITY THAT THERE'S SOME

01:41:16.203 --> 01:41:18.338
INNOVATION AND CREATIVITY OUT

01:41:18.405 --> 01:41:18.939
THERE THAT WE'RE NOT HEARING

01:41:19.006 --> 01:41:19.606
ABOUT.

01:41:19.673 --> 01:41:22.476
THAT OTHERS COULD POSSIBLY USE.

01:41:22.543 --> 01:41:25.045
SO HOW OFTEN.

01:41:25.112 --> 01:41:26.947
ARE WE OR WILL THERE BE AN AUDIT

01:41:27.014 --> 01:41:28.882
LIKE INTERVENTION TO DETERMINE

01:41:28.949 --> 01:41:30.584
THE OUTCOME BEST PRACTICES

01:41:30.651 --> 01:41:33.754
EXPERIENCE LESSONS LEARNED NOT

01:41:33.821 --> 01:41:35.255
TO BE REPLICATED IN THE FUTURE.

01:41:35.322 --> 01:41:37.090
AND SPECIFICALLY HOW THE MONEY

01:41:37.157 --> 01:41:38.959
WAS ALLOCATED AND HOW IT WAS

01:41:39.026 --> 01:41:40.994
ACTUALLY USED ALONG WITH THE

01:41:41.061 --> 01:41:42.095
RESULTS.

01:41:42.162 --> 01:41:43.864
HAVING STATE LEVEL OVERSIGHT

01:41:43.931 --> 01:41:45.833
WILL ENSURE THAT THE BUDGET

01:41:45.899 --> 01:41:47.768
REQUESTED WAS ACTUALLY USED AS

01:41:47.835 --> 01:41:50.437
DESCRIBED IN THE REQUEST THIS IS

02:23:25.563 --> 02:23:26.864
THERE IS MUCH THAT NEEDS TO BE

02:23:26.931 --> 02:23:28.199
DONE IN THIS AREA AND THERE ARE

02:23:28.266 --> 02:23:29.467
A NUMBER OF BILLS MOVING THROUGH

02:23:50.688 --> 02:23:52.623
THIS HORROR STORY PLAYS OUT TIME

02:23:52.690 --> 02:23:53.458
AND AGAIN THE PATIENT IS

02:23:53.524 --> 02:23:55.460
RECRUITED OUT OF STATE BY A BODY

02:23:55.526 --> 02:23:56.694
BROKER.

02:23:56.761 --> 02:23:57.929
OUT OF NETWORK INSURANCE

02:23:57.996 --> 02:23:59.364
POLICIES ARE PURCHASED FOR THE

02:23:59.430 --> 02:24:01.032
PATIENT AND THEN RUN UP TO THE

02:24:01.099 --> 02:24:02.433
TUNE OF HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF

02:24:02.500 --> 02:24:03.267
DOLLARS.

02:24:03.334 --> 02:24:05.136
AFTER THIRTY SIXTY OR NINETY

02:24:05.203 --> 02:24:06.270

02:24:06.337 --> 02:24:07.939

FOR THE CYCLE TO BEGIN AGAIN.

02:24:19.484 --> 02:24:21.185
AND THE REASON THAT THE CYCLE IS

02:24:21.252 --> 02:24:22.720
POSSIBLE IS BECAUSE THERE'S A

02:24:22.787 --> 02:24:24.889
TOTAL LACK OF REGULATION AND

02:24:24.956 --> 02:24:25.790

UNDER CURRENT CALIFORNIA STATE

02:24:34.766 --> 02:24:36.034
LAW THESE FACILITIES ARE

IN ORDER TO FURTHER THEIR

02:24:45.343 --> 02:24:46.811
RECOVERY IT IS TOTALLY

02:24:46.878 --> 02:24:48.546
APPROPRIATE TO TREAT THIS AS A

02:24:48.613 --> 02:24:49.847
SINGLE FAMILY RESIDENCE.

02:24:49.914 --> 02:24:51.315

02:26:00.518 --> 02:26:02.053
CALIFORNIA CONSORTIUM OF

02:26:02.120 --> 02:26:02.520
ADDICTION PROGRAMS AND

02:26:02.587 --> 02:26:03.488
PROFESSIONALS.

02:26:03.554 --> 02:26:05.423
REPRESENTING OVER TWENTY

02:26:05.490 --> 02:26:05.923
THOUSAND DICTION FOCUSED

02:26:05.990 --> 02:26:06.891
COUNSELORS.

02:26:06.958 --> 02:26:08.392
AND OVER FIVE HUNDRED TRIP

PROGRAMS AND SOBER LIVING

02:26:09.193 --> 02:26:10.962
THROUGHOUT THE STATE ALTHOUGH WE

02:26:11.028 --> 02:26:12.497
ARE RESPECTFULLY AGREE WITH THE

02:26:12.563 --> 02:26:15.099
AUTHOR ON THE CONTENTIONS THAT.

02:26:15.166 --> 02:26:16.534
THERE ARE ABUSES IN THE PATIENT

02:26:16.601 --> 02:26:19.103
BROKERING ASPECT OF THE BUSINESS

02:26:19.170 --> 02:26:21.539
THAT NEED TO BE TAKEN CARE OF

02:26:21.606 --> 02:26:22.106
EIGHTY NINE TWENTY DOES NOT

02:26:22.173 --> 02:26:23.074
ADDRESS THOSE CONCERNS.

02:26:23.141 --> 02:26:24.909
WE MUST RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THE

02:26:24.976 --> 02:26:31.349
BILL WE CREATE OUR MEMBERS AND

02:26:31.415 --> 02:26:32.116
FOUND THAT OVER 90% OF THEM.

02:26:32.183 --> 02:26:33.751
OWN MORE THAN.

02:26:33.818 --> 02:26:35.953
ONE FACILITY OR TYPE OF FACILITY

02:26:36.020 --> 02:26:37.788
SO IF THIS WERE TO GO INTO A

02:26:37.855 --> 02:26:39.524
FACT WE WOULD BE LOOKING AT A

02:26:39.590 --> 02:26:41.425
MAJOR CATASTROPHE OF

02:26:41.492 --> 02:26:42.326
CONSTRUCTION.

02:26:42.393 --> 02:26:45.930
AND ACCESS TO THOSE SERVICES --

02:26:45.997 --> 02:26:47.465
IT DOES MAKE SENSE FOR

02:26:47.532 --> 02:26:49.667
BUSINESSES TO OWN MORE THAN ONE

02:26:49.734 --> 02:26:50.768
TREATMENT PROGRAM.

02:26:50.835 --> 02:26:51.836
IF THEY'RE GOOD AT IT IF THEY'RE

02:26:51.903 --> 02:26:53.804
EFFECTIVE THERE SHOULD BE NO

02:26:53.871 --> 02:26:54.405
REASON WHY THEY SHOULDN'T BE

02:26:54.472 --> 02:26:55.973
ABLE TO OWN.

02:26:56.040 --> 02:26:57.441
MORE THAN.

02:26:57.508 --> 02:26:57.975
ONE REMOVING THEIR EIGHTY

02:26:58.042 --> 02:26:59.911
PROTECTION IN MANY COMMUNITIES

02:26:59.977 --> 02:27:01.412
WOULD BASICALLY PUT THEM OUT OF

02:27:01.479 --> 02:27:02.446
BUSINESS.

02:27:02.513 --> 02:27:04.448
SO -- THAT WOULD NOT BE A GOOD

02:27:04.515 --> 02:27:06.851
IDEA ALSO THE CONSORTIUM OF CARE

02:27:06.918 --> 02:27:09.520
IS A CONTINUUM SO IT MAKES SENSE

02:27:09.587 --> 02:27:12.056
FOR A COMPANY.

02:27:12.123 --> 02:27:16.260
TO OWN A A DETOXIFICATION CENTER

02:27:16.327 --> 02:27:17.562
AND THEN PERHAPS AN INPATIENT

02:27:17.628 --> 02:27:19.564
CENTER AND THEN AN OUTPATIENT

02:27:19.630 --> 02:27:20.698
TREATMENT PROGRAM AND MAYBE A

02:27:20.765 --> 02:27:22.133
SOBER LIVING SO THAT THEY COULD

02:27:22.200 --> 02:27:23.935
GUIDE PATIENTS THROUGH THEIR

02:27:24.001 --> 02:27:26.337
CARE -- IN ORGANIZATIONS THEY

02:27:26.404 --> 02:27:27.572
TRUST.

02:27:27.638 --> 02:27:29.440
THERE'S BEEN NO STUDY TO SHOW.

02:27:29.507 --> 02:27:32.143
THAT DO OWNERSHIP OF PROGRAMS OR

02:27:32.210 --> 02:27:33.711
DIFFERENT TYPES OF MODALITIES IS

02:27:33.778 --> 02:27:35.446
A HARM TO THE CUSTOMERS.

02:27:35.513 --> 02:27:36.781
WE WOULD WELCOME -- WORKING WITH

02:27:36.847 --> 02:27:38.316
THE AUTHOR ON ADDRESSING SOME OF

02:27:38.382 --> 02:27:39.483
THE CONCERNS THAT SHE HAS

02:27:39.550 --> 02:27:43.888
PRESENTED TODAY BUT AS IT IS

02:27:43.955 --> 02:27:45.890
WRITTEN WE MUST POST THANK YOU.

02:27:45.957 --> 02:27:47.992
OR ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION.

02:27:48.059 --> 02:27:49.260
IN OUR PRE PACKED THE COMMITTEE

02:27:49.327 --> 02:27:51.095
FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS

02:27:51.162 --> 02:27:52.663
MISTAKE OCCUR.

02:27:52.730 --> 02:27:53.831
THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS

02:27:53.898 --> 02:27:55.967
FORWARD -- SO I I AGREE THAT

02:27:56.033 --> 02:27:57.868
THERE'S PROBABLY GOOD ACTORS OUT

02:27:57.935 --> 02:27:58.269
THERE.

02:27:58.336 --> 02:27:59.637
BUT THE BAD ACTORS ARE TAKING

OVARIAN DYSFUNCTION.

FAMILY MIGHT MY DOCTOR HAD

RECOMMEND FREEZING MY EGGS.

02:36:18.569 --> 02:36:19.069
BECAUSE I WAS LIVING IN THE

STATE OF ILLINOIS.

02:36:20.037 --> 02:36:22.039

SALANDER WENT EGG FREEZING I WAS

02:36:27.611 --> 02:36:30.280

AND THIS BILL AIMS TO CHANGE

02:36:38.288 --> 02:36:38.856
THAT.

02:36:38.922 --> 02:36:40.090
IN MOST CLINICAL CONTEXT

02:36:40.157 --> 02:36:41.225
INFERTILITY IS DEFINED AS THE

02:36:41.291 --> 02:36:42.292
INABILITY TO BECOME PREGNANT

02:36:42.359 --> 02:36:44.228

EVIDENCE THAT SUGGEST THAT IVF

COUNTRY.

02:37:32.142 --> 02:37:33.644
THIS BILL WOULD CHANGE THIS BY

02:37:33.710 --> 02:37:34.978
REQUIRING LARGE GROUP PLANS TO

CHAMBER OF ANALYSIS WE BELIEVE

02:37:42.052 --> 02:37:43.320

COUNTY REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER.

02:38:46.550 --> 02:38:47.751
I SPEAK TODAY AS A MEMBER OF THE

AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR

PROFESSIONAL MEMBER OF RESOLVE.

02:38:52.623 --> 02:38:54.558
AND I'M HERE TODAY TO EDUCATE

02:38:54.625 --> 02:38:56.827
THE MEMBERS ON SOME BASIC FACTS.

02:38:56.894 --> 02:38:58.996
FIRST INFERTILITY IS A

02:38:59.062 --> 02:39:00.864
RECOGNIZED DISEASE OF THE

02:39:00.931 --> 02:39:02.299
REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM.

02:39:02.366 --> 02:39:03.967
SECOND THE INFERTILITY IS

02:39:04.034 --> 02:39:05.969
PREVALENT IN THE UNITED STATES

02:39:06.036 --> 02:39:07.504
INFERTILITY AFFECTS ABOUT SEVEN

02:39:07.571 --> 02:39:09.606
POINT THREE MILLION PEOPLE OR

02:39:09.673 --> 02:39:12.342
12% OF THE REPRODUCTIVE AGE

02:39:12.409 --> 02:39:13.243
POPULATION.

02:39:13.310 --> 02:39:14.378
THERE IS AN EXTENSIVE LIST OF

02:39:14.444 --> 02:39:15.412
CONDITIONS THAT CAUSE

02:39:15.479 --> 02:39:18.081
INFERTILITY AFFECTING BOTH MEN.

02:39:18.148 --> 02:39:19.483
AND WOMEN.

02:39:19.549 --> 02:39:20.951
AND THEY HAVE A WIDE RANGING

02:39:21.018 --> 02:39:23.420
IMPLICATIONS OF HEALTH ISSUES

02:39:23.487 --> 02:39:25.756
THAT OVERLAP WITH INFERTILITY.

02:39:25.822 --> 02:39:27.090
THE PRESENT STATE OF OUR HEALTH

02:39:27.157 --> 02:39:28.792
INSURANCE COVERAGE IS THAT IT

02:39:28.859 --> 02:39:31.361
TREATS SOME MEDICAL CONSEQUENCES

02:39:31.428 --> 02:39:32.796
OF THESE CONDITIONS.

02:39:32.863 --> 02:39:34.631
BUT WHEN IT COMES TO INFERTILITY

02:39:34.698 --> 02:39:36.667
IT EXCLUDES THAT TREATMENT.

02:39:36.733 --> 02:39:37.834
IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU KNOW

02:39:37.901 --> 02:39:40.370
THAT IN VITRO FERTILIZATION IS

02:39:40.437 --> 02:39:42.239
THE STANDARD CARE FOR MEDICAL

02:39:42.306 --> 02:39:43.607
TREATMENT OF REFRACTORY

02:39:43.674 --> 02:39:44.708
INFERTILITY.

02:39:44.775 --> 02:39:47.177
AND IT IS HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL. FOR

02:39:47.244 --> 02:39:49.012
EXAMPLE FOR THIRTY YEAR OLD

02:39:49.079 --> 02:39:50.847
WOMAN WHO UNDERGOES IVF SHE HAS

02:39:50.914 --> 02:39:53.984
A 49% CHANCE OF LIFE BIRTH.

02:39:54.051 --> 02:39:56.653
IN THE SECOND TREATMENT CYCLE

02:39:56.720 --> 02:40:00.090
6169% AND A THIRD 81%.

02:40:00.157 --> 02:40:01.325
THERE ARE FEW MEDICAL

02:40:01.391 --> 02:40:03.593
INTERVENTIONS THAT REPORT SUCH A

02:40:03.660 --> 02:40:05.295
HIGH SUCCESS RATE.

02:40:05.362 --> 02:40:07.297
HOWEVER LACK INSURANCE FOR THIS

02:40:07.364 --> 02:40:09.266
MEDICAL CONDITION RELAYS THE

02:40:09.333 --> 02:40:11.501
RESULT IN A DELAY OF EFFECTIVE

02:40:11.568 --> 02:40:12.235
TREATMENT.

02:40:12.302 --> 02:40:13.503
BECAUSE A WOMAN'S REPRODUCTIVE

02:40:13.570 --> 02:40:15.772
POTENTIAL DECREASES WITH AGE

02:40:15.839 --> 02:40:17.374
DELAYING INTERVENTION DUE TO

02:40:17.441 --> 02:40:19.509
PERSONAL FINANCES RESULT IN A

02:40:19.576 --> 02:40:20.844
LOWER SUCCESS RATE AND AN

02:40:20.911 --> 02:40:22.512
OVERALL HIGHER COST PER LIVE

02:40:22.579 --> 02:40:23.814
BIRTH.

02:40:23.880 --> 02:40:25.015
WITHOUT INSURANCE COVERAGE

02:40:25.082 --> 02:40:26.550
PATIENTS OPERA LESS EXPENSIVE

02:40:26.616 --> 02:40:27.718
TREATMENTS BUT SINCE

02:40:27.784 --> 02:40:30.420
SIGNIFICANTLY LESS EFFECTIVE AND

02:40:30.487 --> 02:40:31.788
THOSE SECONDARY OPTIONS -- SO

02:40:31.855 --> 02:40:32.622
SEE WITH HIGHER RISK OF

02:40:32.689 --> 02:40:34.925
COMPLICATIONS SUCH AS THE TOPIC

02:40:34.992 --> 02:40:36.460
PREGNANCY AND MULTIPLE BIRTH.

02:40:36.526 --> 02:40:37.928
FINALLY INSURANCE COVERAGE IS

02:40:37.995 --> 02:40:39.329
ASSOCIATED WITH BETTER PREGNANCY

02:40:39.396 --> 02:40:41.431
OUTCOMES LOWER HEALTH CARE COSTS

OUR INSURANCE COVER NOTHING.

02:43:28.298 --> 02:43:29.866

02:47:40.617 --> 02:47:44.154
WRONG TIME TO ESTABLISH NEW

02:47:44.220 --> 02:47:47.590
MANDATES FOR COVERAGE THANK YOU.

02:47:47.657 --> 02:47:48.224
STEPHANIE WATKINS ON BEHALF OF

02:47:48.291 --> 02:47:49.426
THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA

02:47:49.492 --> 02:47:50.593
LIFE AND HEALTH INSURANCE

02:47:50.660 --> 02:47:52.495
COMPANIES WE TO WERE OPPOSED TO

02:47:52.562 --> 02:47:53.797
THE BILL AND FORTUNATELY.

02:47:53.863 --> 02:47:54.898
WELL WE HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF

02:47:54.964 --> 02:47:56.366
EMPATHY FOR THE STORIES THAT

02:47:56.433 --> 02:47:57.600
WE'VE ALL HEARD.

02:47:57.667 --> 02:47:58.635
I THINK PUTTING AN ADDITIONAL

02:47:58.701 --> 02:48:00.603
MANDATE ON LARGE GROUP EMPLOYERS

02:48:00.670 --> 02:48:01.938
WHO VOLUNTARILY CHOOSE TO

02:48:02.005 --> 02:48:03.406
PROVIDE HEALTHCARE TO THEIR

02:48:03.473 --> 02:48:04.340
EMPLOYEES.

02:48:04.407 --> 02:48:05.942
IS CERTAINLY AT THE WRONG TIME

02:48:06.009 --> 02:48:07.143
TO DO THAT I THINK THE ALSO

02:48:07.210 --> 02:48:08.478
THING THAT WE'D LIKE TO POINT

02:48:08.545 --> 02:48:09.479
OUT IS.

02:48:09.546 --> 02:48:11.781
IT ME ADDITIONALLY SUBJECT THEM

02:48:11.848 --> 02:48:13.750
TO THE EXCISE TAX IT'S DUE TO BE

02:48:13.817 --> 02:48:16.286
IMPLEMENTED IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO

02:48:16.352 --> 02:48:17.520
IT HAS BEEN DELAYED SEVERAL

02:48:17.587 --> 02:48:19.222
TIMES BUT THERE'S CERTAINLY A

02:48:19.289 --> 02:48:22.192
40% EXCISE TAX IN ADDITION TO

02:48:22.258 --> 02:48:23.359
THE CURRENT PRICES OF HEALTH

02:48:23.426 --> 02:48:24.894
CARE IN THE LARGE GROUP MARKET.

02:48:24.961 --> 02:48:26.429
WOULD FURTHER ENCOURAGE LARGE

02:48:26.496 --> 02:48:27.797
EMPLOYERS TO CONSIDER SELF

02:48:27.864 --> 02:48:29.699
INSURING AND THAT WOULD TAKE

02:48:29.766 --> 02:48:31.267
THEM OUT OF THE OVERSIGHT OF

02:48:31.334 --> 02:48:32.836
CALIFORNIAN PUT THEM UNDER THE

02:48:32.902 --> 02:48:34.037
FEDERAL RESERVE RULES SO

02:48:34.103 --> 02:48:35.371
CERTAINLY FOR THOSE REASONS WERE

02:48:35.438 --> 02:48:36.773
CONCERNED.

02:48:36.840 --> 02:48:37.307

02:53:58.494 --> 02:54:00.263
INCREASED THE NUMBER OF EMBRYOS

02:54:00.329 --> 02:54:02.632
TRANSFERRED HAS DECREASED.

02:54:02.698 --> 02:54:05.568
BUT IN NON MANDATED STATES OKAY

02:54:05.635 --> 02:54:07.303
THERE'S IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR

02:54:07.370 --> 02:54:09.705
A POSITION TO WORK AGAINST THAT

02:54:09.772 --> 02:54:11.274
PRESSURE FROM THE PATIENT WHO

02:54:11.340 --> 02:54:12.375
THINKS THAT.

02:54:12.441 --> 02:54:14.010
PUTTING TWO EMBRYOS BUT BACK IN

02:54:14.076 --> 02:54:15.478
THE UNIVERSE IS BETTER THAN.

02:54:15.545 --> 02:54:17.380
ONE BECAUSE THEY WANT THAT EXTRA

02:54:17.446 --> 02:54:19.382
FIVE OR 7% PREGNANCY RATE WHEN

02:54:19.448 --> 02:54:20.583
THEY'VE GOT INSURANCE COVERAGE

02:54:20.650 --> 02:54:22.051
AND THEY KNOW THAT THEY CAN TRY

02:54:22.118 --> 02:54:22.785
AGAIN.

02:54:22.852 --> 02:54:25.021
THEY'RE MUCH MORE WILLING TO

02:54:25.087 --> 02:54:26.289
SPACE OUT THOSE.

02:54:26.355 --> 02:54:28.291
THAT THAT TREATMENT OVER TIME

02:54:28.357 --> 02:54:29.992
BECAUSE THEY KNOW ULTIMATELY

02:54:30.059 --> 02:54:31.360
THEY'LL BECOME SUCCESSFUL.

02:54:31.427 --> 02:54:33.029
SEVERAL PUBLISHED REPORTS THAT

02:54:33.095 --> 02:54:35.264
CHAU PREGNANCY COMPLICATIONS ARE

02:54:35.331 --> 02:54:37.600
REDUCE HEALTHCARE COSTS REDUCE

02:54:37.667 --> 02:54:39.468
DIRECT DO.

02:54:39.535 --> 02:54:40.269
TO DECREASED RISK OF PRETERM

02:54:40.336 --> 02:54:42.805
DELIVERY AND THERE IS ADVANCE

02:54:42.872 --> 02:54:43.639
ADVANCES MADE WITH EMBRYO

02:54:43.706 --> 02:54:45.141
FREEZING.

02:54:45.208 --> 02:54:46.375
AND WE'RE FINDING IS THAT IF WE

02:54:46.442 --> 02:54:48.144
CAN FREE SURPLUS EMBRYOS

02:54:48.211 --> 02:54:49.178
ENTRANCE AND THEN FROZEN CYCLE

02:54:49.245 --> 02:54:54.283
LOWER RISK OF COMPLICATIONS IN

02:54:54.350 --> 02:54:55.618
PREGNANCY AS WELL.

02:54:55.685 --> 02:54:56.719
SO ARE THERE IS EXISTING STATE

02:54:56.786 --> 02:54:57.954
REGULATIONS AROUND IVF.

02:54:58.020 --> 02:54:59.021
THERE ARE NOT EXISTING STATE

02:54:59.088 --> 02:55:00.256
REGULATIONS I KNOW ABOUT NUMBERS

02:55:00.323 --> 02:55:01.390
OF ANDREAS TO TRANSFER THE

02:55:01.457 --> 02:55:03.059
MEDICAL COMMUNITY IS VERY

02:55:03.125 --> 02:55:04.560
SENSITIVE IT TO IT AND THEY

02:55:04.627 --> 02:55:07.330
PROMOTED AND WANTED VERY MUCH.

02:55:07.396 --> 02:55:09.332
AND WHEN THEY HAVE THE THE

02:55:09.398 --> 02:55:12.235
ABILITY TO ADVOCATE FOR THAT WAS

02:55:12.301 --> 02:55:13.469
SOUND MEDICAL PRACTICE THROUGH

02:55:13.536 --> 02:55:15.671
BETTER ABLE TO CONVINCE PATIENTS

02:55:15.738 --> 02:55:16.472
FOLLOW THAT.

02:55:16.539 --> 02:55:18.674
THAT SOUND MEDICAL ADVICE.

02:55:18.741 --> 02:55:22.245
SO THEY'RE ACTUALLY LOWER RISK.

02:55:22.311 --> 02:55:23.012
WHEN YOU HAVE A MANDATE COVERAGE

02:55:23.079 --> 02:55:25.014
FOR IDEA?

02:55:25.081 --> 02:55:27.950
THAT WILL TAKE TIME THOUGH --

02:55:28.017 --> 02:55:29.218
FOUR FOUR BEHAVIORS TO CHANGE

02:55:29.285 --> 02:55:31.454
NOW IT LOOKS IT DOESN'T IT

02:55:31.520 --> 02:55:33.890
DOESN'T TAKE TIME AT ALL.

02:55:33.956 --> 02:55:34.523
YEAH BUT THE FINISH OF YOU DON'T

02:55:34.590 --> 02:55:36.092
WANT -- SO I SO I'M ASKING YOU

02:55:36.158 --> 02:55:37.360
KNOW I KNOW THE SPONSORS OF THE

02:55:37.426 --> 02:55:39.562
BILL -- HAVE RECOMMENDED

02:55:39.629 --> 02:55:41.964
GUIDELINES SO YOU HAVE

02:55:42.031 --> 02:55:43.266
RECOMMENDED GUIDELINES FOR THIS.

02:55:43.332 --> 02:55:44.867
ARE THERE IS THERE ANY STATE

02:55:44.934 --> 02:55:48.304
OVERSIGHT -- FOR EXISTING --

02:55:48.371 --> 02:55:50.339
EXISTING FOR FERTILITY CLINICS

02:55:50.406 --> 02:55:52.275
AND CALIFORNIA BECAUSE I LOOK AT

02:55:52.341 --> 02:55:56.112
THE CASE WE HAD YOU KNOW. EIGHT

02:55:56.178 --> 02:55:57.346
EIGHT EIGHT BIRTH IN A A A BIRTH

02:55:57.413 --> 02:55:59.015
OF A BABY SO YOU KNOW.

02:55:59.081 --> 02:56:00.516
I JUST THINK YEAH SHE HAD

02:56:00.583 --> 02:56:02.184
INSURANCE COVERAGE -- BUT NO

02:56:02.251 --> 02:56:03.853
THIS IS ONE OF THE FEW AREAS OF

02:56:03.920 --> 02:56:04.854
MEDICINE THAT ACTUALLY IS

02:56:04.921 --> 02:56:08.658
REGULATED AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL.

02:56:08.724 --> 02:56:10.726
EVERY CYCLE OF IVF THAT THE

02:56:10.793 --> 02:56:12.795
START IS REPORTED TO THE CENTERS

02:56:12.862 --> 02:56:14.530
FOR DISEASE CONTROL WE HAVE A

02:56:14.597 --> 02:56:16.198
SISTER ORGANIZATION THE SOCIETY

02:56:16.265 --> 02:56:17.433
FOR ASSISTED REPRODUCTIVE

02:56:17.500 --> 02:56:18.567
TECHNOLOGY.

02:56:18.634 --> 02:56:20.169
THAT MONITORS ALL THIS AND IT IS

02:56:20.236 --> 02:56:21.771
AMAZING BECAUSE THAT THE DOCTORS

02:56:21.837 --> 02:56:23.472
IN THIS FIELD SPECIALIZED IN

02:56:23.539 --> 02:56:24.206
THIS.

02:56:24.273 --> 02:56:26.475
SO THE LEARNING CURVE IS SO

02:56:26.542 --> 02:56:28.110
DIFFERENT IN THIS AREA AND THE

02:56:28.177 --> 02:56:29.879
ACCEPTANCE AND THAT THE CHANGE

02:56:29.946 --> 02:56:31.047
IN PRACTICE.

02:56:31.113 --> 02:56:32.915
IS IS SO GREAT COMPARED TO OTHER

02:56:32.982 --> 02:56:34.250
AREAS OF MEDICINE IT DOESN'T

02:56:34.317 --> 02:56:36.319
TAKE TEN YEARS TO MAKE A CHANGE

02:56:36.385 --> 02:56:37.486
IN THEM THE PROFESSIONAL

02:56:37.553 --> 02:56:38.988
GUIDELINES SO THERE REALLY.

02:56:39.055 --> 02:56:40.790
PROBABLY ONE OF THE MORE DATA

02:56:40.856 --> 02:56:45.828
DRIVEN AREAS OF MEDICINE.

02:56:45.895 --> 02:56:47.430
THERE ARE THERE ARE RECOMMENDED

02:56:47.496 --> 02:56:49.332
GUIDELINES BY A SURROUND LIKE

02:56:49.398 --> 02:56:49.799
PERSONALLY.

02:56:49.865 --> 02:56:50.833
YEAH I WAS I BUT I WAS LOOKING

02:56:50.900 --> 02:56:52.635
ARE THERE ANY STATE REGULATIONS

02:56:52.702 --> 02:56:53.769
OR THE RAINY AND AND SORT YOUR

02:56:53.836 --> 02:56:55.037
FEDERAL.

02:56:55.104 --> 02:56:57.373
AND SO THAT MAKES ME GO BACK AND

02:56:57.440 --> 02:56:58.808
WONDER AT SOME POINT IF.

02:56:58.874 --> 02:57:00.176
YOU KNOW WE MOVE FORWARD WITH

02:57:00.242 --> 02:57:03.379
THIS -- THAT WE DO -- LOOK AT

02:57:03.446 --> 02:57:06.549
POTENTIAL STATE STATE GUIDELINES

02:57:06.615 --> 02:57:08.184
ON THIS.

02:57:08.250 --> 02:57:09.352
I'M SORRY I THIS THIS IS THE

02:57:09.418 --> 02:57:09.952
STATE OF CALIFORNIA WITH MY

02:57:10.019 --> 02:57:11.020

AND AND WE'RE ALSO HAPPY TO LOOK

02:57:15.257 --> 02:57:15.791
AT OTHER STATES AND SEE WHAT

02:57:15.858 --> 02:57:16.392
THEY'VE ADOPTED AND AND KEEP

02:57:16.459 --> 02:57:18.227

AND I GUESS AND I GUESS IT GOES

02:57:20.463 --> 02:57:22.064
BACK TO MY ORIGINAL COMMENTS

02:57:22.131 --> 02:57:24.333
ABOUT THE THE UNFORESEEN

02:57:24.400 --> 02:57:25.668
POTENTIAL COST OF CARE.

02:57:25.735 --> 02:57:27.036
OF OF OTHER CARE AS WE'RE

02:57:27.103 --> 02:57:29.739
TRANSITIONING TO A POINT WHERE

02:57:29.805 --> 02:57:31.607
YOU ACTUALLY HAVE MORE -- WE

02:57:31.674 --> 02:57:34.176
HAVE COVERAGE FOR THIS -- IT'S

02:57:34.243 --> 02:57:35.511
STILL GOING TO TAKE AWHILE

02:57:35.578 --> 02:57:36.779
BEHAVIOR DOESN'T TRACK.

02:57:36.846 --> 02:57:38.347
MEDICAL BEHAVIOR ISN'T CHANGED

03:07:22.998 --> 03:07:25.634
FAMILY BY MEANS OF ADOPTION.

03:07:25.701 --> 03:07:27.069
AFTER MANY CLASSES BACKGROUND

03:07:27.135 --> 03:07:28.170
CHECKS FROM STUDIES WE FINALLY

03:07:28.236 --> 03:07:29.204
RECEIVED THE CALL FROM THE

03:07:29.271 --> 03:07:30.472
SOCIAL WORKER THAT CHANGED OUR

03:07:30.539 --> 03:07:32.174
LIVES FOREVER.

03:07:32.240 --> 03:07:33.609
ABOUT A MONTH LATER WE FOUND

03:07:33.675 --> 03:07:34.643
OURSELVES IN A HOSPITAL ROOM

03:07:34.710 --> 03:07:36.945
HOLDING OUR ADOPTED NEWBORN.

03:07:37.012 --> 03:07:37.980
BABY BOY.

03:07:38.046 --> 03:07:39.548
WHO MEET TOGETHER NAMES AS AN

03:07:39.615 --> 03:07:40.916
ADOPTIVE FAMILY?

03:07:40.983 --> 03:07:43.151
ALONG WITH -- THE BIOLOGICAL

03:07:43.218 --> 03:07:45.320
MOTHER NICOLAS.

03:07:45.387 --> 03:07:47.723
NICOLAS CRIED UNCONTROLLABLY

03:07:47.789 --> 03:07:49.758
WHEN THE HOSPITAL AND HE SEEMS

03:07:49.825 --> 03:07:51.259
SLIGHTLY YELLOW.

03:07:51.326 --> 03:07:52.427
BUT WE WERE SURE THAT THIS IS

03:07:52.494 --> 03:07:54.329
NORMAL.

03:07:54.396 --> 03:07:55.764
ABOUT THREE MONTHS AFTER HE WAS

03:07:55.831 --> 03:07:56.531
BORN.

03:07:56.598 --> 03:07:58.300
NICHOLAS GOT REALLY SICK WITH A

03:07:58.367 --> 03:08:00.035
RESPIRATORY VIRUS.

03:08:00.102 --> 03:08:01.470
HE SEEMED TO HAVE NEVER FULLY

03:08:01.536 --> 03:08:03.639
RECOVERED AND CONTINUOUSLY BEING

03:08:03.705 --> 03:08:05.107
PRESCRIBED READING TREATMENTS.

03:08:05.173 --> 03:08:06.408
AS WELL AS NEVER ENDING

03:08:06.475 --> 03:08:09.111
ANTIBIOTICS.

03:08:09.177 --> 03:08:10.612
ORAL STEROIDS SEEM TO BE ENERGY

03:08:10.679 --> 03:08:12.314
SHORTLY AFTER AND IT SEEMED TO

03:08:12.381 --> 03:08:13.882
MAKE HIM MORE COMFORTABLE BUT

03:08:13.949 --> 03:08:15.183
THE CRYING AND SCREAMING

03:08:15.250 --> 03:08:17.552
CONTINUED.

03:08:17.619 --> 03:08:18.854
I CONTINUE TO QUESTION

03:08:18.920 --> 03:08:21.289
PEDIATRICIANS NURSES AND ANYONE

03:08:21.356 --> 03:08:23.091
WHO WOULD JUST LISTEN TO MY

03:08:23.158 --> 03:08:25.127
STORY.

03:08:25.193 --> 03:08:26.795
I WAS ADVISED THAT BECAUSE I'M A

03:08:26.862 --> 03:08:28.063
FIRST TIME MOM.

03:08:28.130 --> 03:08:31.533
THAT THIS IS NORMAL.

03:08:31.600 --> 03:08:33.201
WHEN NICHOLAS WAS CLOSE TO THREE

03:08:33.268 --> 03:08:34.036
YEARS OLD?

03:08:34.102 --> 03:08:36.371
I MADE THE DECISION TO FINALLY

03:08:36.438 --> 03:08:38.006
SWITCHED PEDIATRICIANS.

03:08:38.073 --> 03:08:40.075
IT WASN'T VERY LONG AFTER THAT

03:08:40.142 --> 03:08:44.613
WE FINALLY HEARD.

03:08:44.680 --> 03:08:46.314
A DIFFERENT DIAGNOSIS.

03:08:46.381 --> 03:08:47.783
HIS PEDIATRICIANS RAN LABS MADE

03:08:47.849 --> 03:08:49.418
CALLS TO HIS COLLEAGUES AND THEN

03:08:49.484 --> 03:08:50.385
REFERRED.

03:08:50.452 --> 03:08:52.654
US TO A GASTRO INTERNALLY JUST

03:08:52.721 --> 03:08:53.855
IN PALO ALTO.

03:08:53.922 --> 03:08:55.023
NICHOLAS WAS ADMITTED TO THE

03:08:55.090 --> 03:08:56.658
GOOD SAMARITAN HOSPITAL.

03:08:56.725 --> 03:08:58.360
INTEL HIS OXYGEN LEVELS BEGIN

03:08:58.427 --> 03:09:01.129
STABLE AND THEN WAS REFER TO

03:09:01.196 --> 03:09:01.697
LUCILLE PACKARD CHILDREN'S

03:09:01.763 --> 03:09:03.465
HOSPITAL.

03:09:03.532 --> 03:09:06.668
ONCOLOGY AND HEMATOLOGY.

03:09:06.735 --> 03:09:07.736
NICHOLAS WAS DIAGNOSED SOON

03:09:07.803 --> 03:09:09.104
AFTER WITH BETA THALASSEMIA

03:09:09.171 --> 03:09:11.173
INTERMEDIA A BLOOD DISORDER THAT

03:09:11.239 --> 03:09:12.774
IMPAIRS THE ABILITY.

03:09:12.841 --> 03:09:16.344
OF THE BODY TO DELIVER OXYGEN'S

03:09:16.411 --> 03:09:17.612
SELLS TO ITS TISSUES.

03:09:17.679 --> 03:09:19.214
BUT WE WERE TOLD THAT SOMETHING

03:09:19.281 --> 03:09:21.016
ELSE WASN'T RIGHT.

03:09:21.083 --> 03:09:22.117
WE WERE ASKED TO TAKE HIM BACK

03:09:22.184 --> 03:09:23.418
TO THE HOSPITAL FOR A LIVER

03:09:23.485 --> 03:09:24.986
BIOPSY.

03:09:25.053 --> 03:09:26.922
AND ANOTHER BLOOD DRAW DUE TO

03:09:26.988 --> 03:09:28.290
HIS HIGH ENZYMES.

03:09:28.356 --> 03:09:39.034
INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH HE WAS

03:09:39.101 --> 03:09:40.736
DIAGNOSED WITH JOE BEAR SYNDROME.

03:09:40.802 --> 03:09:45.207
BOB IS CAME BACK IN THREE DAYS.

03:09:45.273 --> 03:09:46.641
IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE FIRST

03:09:46.708 --> 03:09:49.344
IT REVEALED THAT HE HAD SOME

03:09:49.411 --> 03:09:51.012
SORT OF MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY.

03:09:51.079 --> 03:09:52.714
SO NOT CLEAR WHICH KIND HE'D

03:09:52.781 --> 03:09:55.250
BEEN REFERRED TO THE MDA CLINIC.

03:09:55.317 --> 03:09:57.853
FOR FURTHER TESTING WHICH INTEL

03:09:57.919 --> 03:09:59.287
GENETIC SEQUENCING.

03:09:59.354 --> 03:10:01.656
AT THAT TIME TO CLOSE WAS THREE

03:10:01.723 --> 03:10:02.991
AND A HALF YEARS OLD TO THE DATE.

03:10:03.058 --> 03:10:04.559
HE WAS FEELING BETTER BACK TO

03:10:04.626 --> 03:10:05.727
DAY CARE.

03:10:05.794 --> 03:10:07.295
AND I FOUND MYSELF GROCERY

03:10:07.362 --> 03:10:08.663
SHOPPING AND SAFE WAY.

03:10:08.730 --> 03:10:10.866
AND MY PHONE RANG.

03:10:10.932 --> 03:10:12.100
IT WAS THE NEUROLOGISTS TELLING

03:10:12.167 --> 03:10:14.603
ME MRS ARCHDEACON.

03:10:14.669 --> 03:10:15.937
YOUR SON HAS CHEN SKEWER

03:10:16.004 --> 03:10:17.639
DYSTROPHY.

03:10:17.706 --> 03:10:19.574
HE WILL START TO LOSE THE

03:10:19.641 --> 03:10:21.576
ABILITY TO WALK.

03:10:21.643 --> 03:10:24.279
HIS RESPIRATORY HOPE WILL FADE

03:10:24.346 --> 03:10:24.579
[inaudible]

03:10:24.646 --> 03:10:26.681
AND EVENTUALLY.

03:10:26.748 --> 03:10:27.282
HIS HEART WE'RE GOING TO FILL

03:10:27.349 --> 03:10:30.418
YOUR THERE IS NO CURE THERE'S NO

03:10:30.485 --> 03:10:31.353
THERAPY.

03:10:31.419 --> 03:10:33.321
AND ALL I CAN DO IS REFER YOU TO

03:10:33.388 --> 03:10:34.556
CCS.

03:10:34.623 --> 03:10:36.992
WITH THE HOPES TO BEGIN PHYSICAL

03:10:37.058 --> 03:10:38.059
THERAPY.

03:10:38.126 --> 03:10:40.095
JUST GO HOME AND ENJOY THE TIME

03:10:40.162 --> 03:10:41.496
YOU HAVE WITH THEM.

03:10:41.563 --> 03:10:43.598
THE AVERAGE LIFESPAN IS INTO THE

03:10:43.665 --> 03:10:45.167
LATE TEENS.

03:10:45.233 --> 03:10:46.668
CAN YOU IMAGINE BEING IN THE

03:10:46.735 --> 03:10:48.270
MIDDLE OF THE GROCERY STORE IN

03:10:48.336 --> 03:10:51.273
GETTING THAT CALL.

03:10:51.339 --> 03:10:53.074
I IMMEDIATELY FELT A LOSS FOR MY

03:10:53.141 --> 03:10:55.110
CHILD.

03:10:55.177 --> 03:10:57.045
AND THEN INGER.

03:10:57.112 --> 03:10:59.481
SO LONG BECAUSE I WAS DISMISSED

03:10:59.548 --> 03:11:03.018
AS BEING A FIRST TIME MOM.

03:11:03.084 --> 03:11:05.220
I WENT HOME TOGETHER MY THOUGHTS

03:11:05.287 --> 03:11:06.755
AND SORT OUT THE BEST YOU XIN

03:11:06.822 --> 03:11:08.623
NEUROLOGISTS WHO IS LOCATED UP

03:11:08.690 --> 03:11:10.425
ALL THE WAY ACROSS THE COUNTRY

03:11:10.492 --> 03:11:12.260
IN CINCINNATI.

03:11:12.327 --> 03:11:13.461
WE WERE GIVEN A WEALTH OF

03:11:13.528 --> 03:11:14.796
KNOWLEDGE AND HELP.

03:11:14.863 --> 03:11:16.164
BUT NOT EVERYONE HAS THE OPTION

03:11:16.231 --> 03:11:17.699
TO TRAVEL ACROSS THE UNITED

03:11:17.766 --> 03:11:19.267
STATES FOR CARE.

03:11:19.334 --> 03:11:20.569
MANY THINGS HAVE CHANGED OVER

03:11:20.635 --> 03:11:22.904
THE LAST FEW YEARS IN CALIFORNIA

03:11:22.971 --> 03:11:24.306
BUT IT'S STILL SLOW PROCESS.

03:11:24.372 --> 03:11:26.074
MANY SERVICES ARE DENIED BECAUSE

03:11:26.141 --> 03:11:28.443
OF LACK OF KNOWLEDGE.

03:11:28.510 --> 03:11:30.011
OF HIS COMPLEX MEDICAL NEEDS.

03:11:30.078 --> 03:11:31.680
NICHOLAS HAS A MULTIPLE

03:11:31.746 --> 03:11:32.881
SPECIALIST.

03:11:32.948 --> 03:11:34.516
WHO WERE NOT EASY TO FIND DUE TO

03:11:34.583 --> 03:11:36.318
LACK OF UNDERSTANDING OF THE

03:11:36.384 --> 03:11:37.786
NEEDS OF RARE DISEASE?

03:11:37.853 --> 03:11:39.187
AND DUE TO HIS NEVER ENDING

03:11:39.254 --> 03:11:40.188
PROCESS.

03:11:40.255 --> 03:11:41.723
IN THE NEVER ENDING PERSISTENCE

03:11:41.790 --> 03:11:43.825
AND CARE NICHOLAS IS DOING MUCH

03:11:43.892 --> 03:11:45.493
BETTER THAN THE AVERAGE CHILD

03:11:45.560 --> 03:11:46.595
WITH TO SHINE.

03:11:46.661 --> 03:11:48.230
WE WERE ACTUALLY TOLD BY THE

03:11:48.296 --> 03:11:49.798
TIME HE WAS TWELVE YEARS OLD HE

03:11:49.865 --> 03:11:52.467
WOULD BE ENOUGH POWER CHAIR FULL

03:11:52.534 --> 03:11:53.034
TIME.

03:11:53.101 --> 03:11:54.169
HE WOULD NEVER BE ABLE TO RUN

03:11:54.236 --> 03:11:55.704
JUMPERS GET.

03:11:55.770 --> 03:11:57.706
WITH EARLY INTERVENTION AND

03:11:57.772 --> 03:12:00.709
CONTINUE THERAPY NECKLACES

03:12:00.775 --> 03:12:01.309
TWELVE YEARS OLD TODAY AND CAN

03:12:01.376 --> 03:12:02.611
STILL WALK.

03:12:02.677 --> 03:12:05.113
HE CAN RUN HE CAN SKIP HE CAN

03:12:05.180 --> 03:12:06.214
JUMP.

03:12:06.281 --> 03:12:07.849
AND WE WERE EXTREMELY CAUTIOUS

03:12:07.916 --> 03:12:10.285
AS WE ARE WHERE WHAT TO LOOK FOR

03:12:10.352 --> 03:12:11.820
WHEN HE'S.

03:12:11.887 --> 03:12:13.388
FIFTEEN NEEDING CONSTANT BREAKS.

03:12:13.455 --> 03:12:14.956
WHAT THIS HE HAS LAST MEDICAL

03:12:15.023 --> 03:12:16.925
VISITS LESS NEED FOR IN HELD

03:12:16.992 --> 03:12:18.927
MEDICATIONS AND A STABLE WITH

03:12:18.994 --> 03:12:21.529
HIS WITH JUST A FEW MEDICATIONS?

03:12:21.596 --> 03:12:23.999
I OFTEN THINK ABOUT WHAT IF I

03:12:24.065 --> 03:12:26.434
WASN'T SO PERSISTENT.

03:12:26.501 --> 03:12:27.903
WHAT IF I HAD WAITED AND WHAT IF

03:12:27.969 --> 03:12:29.704
I LISTEN TO THESE MEDICAL

03:12:29.771 --> 03:12:31.606
PROFESSIONALS?

03:12:31.673 --> 03:12:33.708
WOULD HE BE ALIVE TODAY.

03:12:33.775 --> 03:12:34.976
WOULD HE BE WALKING.

03:12:35.043 --> 03:12:37.145
MOST LIKELY NOT.

03:12:37.212 --> 03:12:38.580
HAVING A CHILD WITH MULTIPLE

03:12:38.647 --> 03:12:40.081
RARE DISEASES IS EXTREMELY

03:12:40.148 --> 03:12:41.316
DIFFICULT WHEN THOSE WHO ARE

03:12:41.383 --> 03:12:42.817
MAKING THE DECISIONS.

03:12:42.884 --> 03:12:44.386
DO NOT UNDERSTAND THE MEDICAL

03:12:44.452 --> 03:12:45.954
COMPLEXITY OF LIVING WITH A RARE

03:12:46.021 --> 03:12:47.422
DISEASE.

03:12:47.489 --> 03:12:49.057
WE'VE BEEN TOLD MANY TIMES OVER

03:12:49.124 --> 03:12:50.592
AND OVER THAT IF THEY CAN'T SEE

03:12:50.659 --> 03:12:53.628
IMPROVEMENT HE WILL NO LONGER BE.

03:12:53.695 --> 03:12:54.529
WILL NO LONGER QUALIFY FOR

03:12:54.596 --> 03:12:56.698
THERAPY.

03:12:56.765 --> 03:12:58.066
HIS DISEASES ARE PROGRESSIVE

03:12:58.133 --> 03:13:00.001
THEY'RE NOT CURABLE BUT HE

03:13:00.068 --> 03:13:01.870
DESERVES A QUALITY LIFE LIKE

03:13:01.937 --> 03:13:03.538
EVERY OTHER PERSON.

03:13:03.605 --> 03:13:05.440
I'VE OFTEN WISHED THAT THERE WAS

03:13:05.507 --> 03:13:07.242
ANOTHER VOICE FOR MY SON.

03:13:07.309 --> 03:13:09.311
AND OTHERS WHEN MAKING DECISIONS

03:13:09.377 --> 03:13:11.880
ON SERVICES AND PROVIDED CARE.

03:13:11.947 --> 03:13:14.015
AND I TRULY HOPE THAT WE CAN SEE

03:13:14.082 --> 03:13:16.117
A DAY VERY SOON WHEN WE WILL

03:13:16.184 --> 03:13:17.552
HAVE A VOICE OF UNDERSTANDING

03:13:17.619 --> 03:13:18.753
THAT CHILDREN LIKE MINE ARE

03:13:18.820 --> 03:13:20.355
COOKIE CUTTER.

03:13:20.422 --> 03:13:21.856
MY HOPES ARE THAT WE CAN HAVE A

03:13:21.923 --> 03:13:23.124
RARE DISEASE.

OF THE STATE'S NO HEALTH

03:44:44.938 --> 03:44:46.840
COMMISSION -- THIS IS A A BILL

03:44:46.906 --> 03:44:48.675
THAT REALLY PUTS IN PLACE THREE

03:44:48.741 --> 03:44:49.542
STRATEGIES THAT WE THINK ARE

03:44:49.609 --> 03:44:51.177
VERY IMPORTANT IN TERMS OF OUR

03:44:51.244 --> 03:44:52.612
ABILITY TO SUPPORT THE

03:44:52.679 --> 03:44:54.514
TRANSFORMATIONAL CHANGE THAT WE

03:44:54.581 --> 03:44:55.915
NEED OUR MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM.

03:44:55.982 --> 03:44:58.218
FIRST IT REQUIRES THE COMMISSION

03:44:58.284 --> 03:44:59.219
TO PUT IN PLACE A PRETTY

03:44:59.285 --> 03:45:01.487
COMPREHENSIVE ACCOUNTABILITY AND

03:45:01.554 --> 03:45:04.224
TRANSPARENCY -- STRATEGY WE'VE

03:45:04.290 --> 03:45:05.625
BEGUN THAT WORK BUT IT'S WHAT

03:45:05.692 --> 03:45:07.393
WE'VE DONE IS VERY LIMITED TO

03:45:07.460 --> 03:45:09.462
THE M. HSA PORTION OF THE MENTAL

03:45:09.529 --> 03:45:10.363
HEALTH CERTAIN MENTAL HEALTH

03:45:10.430 --> 03:45:12.532
SYSTEM THAT'S ABOUT 25% OF OUR

03:45:12.599 --> 03:45:13.933
SYSTEM WE KNOW VERY LITTLE.

03:45:14.000 --> 03:45:16.102
ABOUT THE OTHER THREE QUARTERS

03:45:16.169 --> 03:45:17.203
OF OUR MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM.

03:45:17.270 --> 03:45:20.073
BUT IN ADDITION TO HAVING US --

03:45:20.139 --> 03:45:21.975
IMPROVE OUR ABILITY TO INFORM

03:45:22.041 --> 03:45:24.043
YOU AND THE PUBLIC ABOUT WHAT'S

03:45:24.110 --> 03:45:25.245
WORKING WHAT'S NOT WORKING IN

03:45:25.311 --> 03:45:26.446
THE MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM.

03:45:26.512 --> 03:45:29.048
IT ALSO EMPOWERS THE COMMISSION.

03:45:29.115 --> 03:45:30.617
TO PUT IN PLACE STRATEGIES TO

03:45:30.683 --> 03:45:32.185
DRIVE IMPROVEMENT.

03:45:32.252 --> 03:45:34.153
BY FIRST SUPPORTING OUR ABILITY

03:45:34.220 --> 03:45:35.922
TO FACILITATE INNOVATION ACROSS

03:45:35.989 --> 03:45:37.423
COUNTY SOMETHING THAT WE STARTED

03:45:37.490 --> 03:45:39.192
BUT THAT WE HAVE LIMITED ABILITY

03:45:39.259 --> 03:45:40.660
TO DO IN THIS BILL WOULD EXPAND

03:45:40.727 --> 03:45:41.628
UPON THAT.

03:45:41.694 --> 03:45:43.129
AND AND IN MANY WAYS MORE

03:45:43.196 --> 03:45:45.198
IMPORTANTLY -- IT WOULD PUT IN

03:45:45.265 --> 03:45:46.466
PLACE STRATEGIES FOR TECHNICAL

03:45:46.532 --> 03:45:47.767
ASSISTANCE FOR THE COUNTIES WE

03:45:47.834 --> 03:45:49.569

03:45:54.173 --> 03:45:55.141
HEALTH SYSTEM.

03:45:55.208 --> 03:45:56.109
AND WHAT MANY OF THOSE OFFICIALS

03:45:56.175 --> 03:45:58.511
SAID IS THAT THE STATE NEEDS TO

03:45:58.578 --> 03:45:59.445
PUT IN PLACE A TECHNICAL

03:45:59.512 --> 03:46:00.813
ASSISTANCE STRATEGY THAT CAN

03:46:00.880 --> 03:46:03.049
HELP THEM BUILD UPON SUCCESSES

03:46:03.116 --> 03:46:04.584
IN SOME PARTS OF THE STATE AND

03:46:04.651 --> 03:46:05.585
EXTENT OF SUCCESSES TO OTHER

03:46:05.652 --> 03:46:06.519
AREAS.

03:46:06.586 --> 03:46:07.854
SO WE REALLY LIKE THIS BILL

03:46:07.921 --> 03:46:09.255
BECAUSE IT COMBINES THE

03:46:09.322 --> 03:46:10.823
COMMISSION'S ABILITY TO REALLY

03:46:12.258 --> 03:46:13.359
WHAT'S NOT WORKING.

03:46:13.426 --> 03:46:15.061
BUT ALSO TO PUT IN PLACE THE

03:46:15.128 --> 03:46:16.596
STRATEGIES FOR IMPROVEMENTS IN

03:46:16.663 --> 03:46:17.563

STILL MAJOR HOLES IN THE LAW

03:55:35.054 --> 03:55:36.522
POTENTIALLY IMPACTING MILLIONS

03:55:36.589 --> 03:55:37.823

OUR BILL WOULD PROTECT PATIENTS

HOSPITAL IS OUT OF NETWORK.

03:56:05.918 --> 03:56:07.052
HOSPITALS WOULD NOT BE ALLOWED

03:56:07.119 --> 03:56:08.287

03:56:16.328 --> 03:56:17.396
OUT WITH THE INSURANCE COMPANY

03:56:17.463 --> 03:56:18.998
OUR BILL ALSO PROPOSES

03:56:19.064 --> 03:56:21.066
STANDARDIZING THOSE NEGOTIATIONS

03:56:21.133 --> 03:56:21.534
SO THAT THERE IS SOME

03:56:21.600 --> 03:56:22.735
PREDICTABILITY.

03:56:22.801 --> 03:56:24.036

HANDLED IN PREVIOUS LEGISLATION.

03:56:30.276 --> 03:56:31.277

ONLY THING A PATIENT SHOULD

WORRY ABOUT IS HOW TO GET BETTER

03:56:51.830 --> 03:56:53.465
NOT WHETHER HOSPITAL BILL COULD

03:56:53.532 --> 03:56:55.267

OF THE BALANCE BILLING --

04:03:07.572 --> 04:03:09.675
SITUATION OUT WE WOULD DO

04:03:09.741 --> 04:03:10.842
BELIEVE THAT WHEN PEOPLE ARE IN

04:03:10.909 --> 04:03:11.910
HOSPITAL THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE TO

04:03:11.977 --> 04:03:13.078

GOING TO RECEIVE THEY SHOULD

04:03:16.848 --> 04:03:17.349
WORRY ABOUT THE CARE THEY'RE

GOING TO GOT.

04:03:18.083 --> 04:03:18.684
AND THE SIMPLEST WAY TO DO THAT

04:03:18.750 --> 04:03:21.386
IS TO LEAVE THE BILL -- TO JUST

04:03:21.453 --> 04:03:23.555
REMOVE THAT PREVENT PROVISION --

04:03:23.622 --> 04:03:26.391

04:03:30.262 --> 04:03:30.696
OF THE DEFAULT RATE FOR

04:03:30.762 --> 04:03:32.965

04:03:33.031 --> 04:03:36.134
PREVIOUS COMMITTEES AB SEVENTY

04:03:36.201 --> 04:03:38.103
TWO MADE SOME I'D CHANGES IN THE

04:03:38.170 --> 04:03:39.871
SYSTEM CREATED DEFAULT RATE AND

04:03:39.938 --> 04:03:41.707
UNFORTUNATELY CRATED -- SOME

04:03:41.773 --> 04:03:43.742
ISSUES FOR PROVIDERS WE ARE

04:03:43.809 --> 04:03:45.544
TALKING ABOUT OUR FOUR HUNDRED

04:03:45.610 --> 04:03:46.979
HOSPITALS AND SYSTEM SO WE ARE

04:03:47.045 --> 04:03:48.413
CONCERNED THAT THE DEFAULT RATE

04:03:48.480 --> 04:03:49.648
COULD HAVE.

04:03:49.715 --> 04:03:51.950
CONSEQUENCES FOR THOSE HOSPITALS

04:03:52.017 --> 04:03:53.919
AS IT ROLLS FORWARD.

04:03:53.986 --> 04:03:56.088
WE AS AS WE STE -- SAID THOSE

04:03:56.154 --> 04:03:57.556
SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES COULD

04:03:57.622 --> 04:03:59.324
CREATE AT A RATE THAT COULD

04:03:59.391 --> 04:04:03.729
DECREASE OVER TIME I'M IN -- FOR

04:04:03.795 --> 04:04:05.330
FOR OUR HOSPITALS WERE 38% OF

04:04:05.397 --> 04:04:06.298
THEM ARE IN THE RED THAT'S ABOUT

04:04:06.365 --> 04:04:07.733
A HUNDRED AND FIFTY HOSPITALS WE

04:04:07.799 --> 04:04:09.768
ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE LONG

04:04:09.835 --> 04:04:11.837
TERM CONSEQUENCES OF THAT -- WE

04:04:11.903 --> 04:04:13.438
DO HAVE A WELL ESTABLISHED

04:04:13.505 --> 04:04:15.707
SYSTEM. TO MANAGE THE RATE

04:04:15.774 --> 04:04:18.210
NEGOTIATIONS THAT RELIES ON THE

04:04:18.276 --> 04:04:19.177
REASONABLE AND CUSTOMARY

04:04:19.244 --> 04:04:21.246
STANDARDS DEVELOPED OVER YEARS

04:04:21.313 --> 04:04:23.281
OF COURT CASES -- AND THAT IS

04:04:23.348 --> 04:04:25.150
USED CURRENTLY BETWEEN OUR

04:04:25.217 --> 04:04:26.685
INSURERS AND OUR HOSPITALS THESE

04:04:26.752 --> 04:04:28.954
ARE VERY SOPHISTICATED ENTITIES

04:04:29.021 --> 04:04:30.622
AND WE BELIEVE CONTINUING THAT

04:04:30.689 --> 04:04:32.624
WILL PROVIDE THE CONTINUITY

04:04:32.691 --> 04:04:36.328
WHILE STILL GETTING THE PATIENT

04:04:36.395 --> 04:04:37.262
OUT OF THE MIDDLE.

04:04:37.329 --> 04:04:38.263
WE DO UNDERSTAND THAT TAKING THE

04:04:38.330 --> 04:04:40.265
BENCH MARK MEDICARE RATE OUT --

04:04:40.332 --> 04:04:43.335

CONTRACT RATE REMAINING --

04:04:45.303 --> 04:04:47.172
UNFORTUNATELY COULD CONTINUE

04:04:47.239 --> 04:04:50.175
COULD DISCOURAGE HEALTH PLANS --

04:04:50.242 --> 04:04:51.977
FROM CONTRACTING ON A GOING

04:04:52.044 --> 04:04:54.379
FORWARD BASIS I'M AND WE ARE

04:04:54.446 --> 04:04:55.714
CONCERNED ABOUT THAT -- OUR

04:04:55.781 --> 04:04:57.616
HOSPITALS NEGOTIATE DISCOUNT

04:04:57.682 --> 04:04:59.317
RATES BASED ON PATIENT VOLUME

04:04:59.384 --> 04:05:01.219
BROUGHT BY THE PLAN -- AND WE

04:05:01.286 --> 04:05:03.922
WILL IN THIS BILL COULD ALLOW

04:05:03.989 --> 04:05:05.590
THOSE HOSPITALS I'M RIGHT IT

04:05:05.657 --> 04:05:09.394
COULD DISCONTINUE THAT -- SORRY

04:05:09.461 --> 04:05:11.763
COULD DISCONTINUE THE INCENTIVE

04:05:11.830 --> 04:05:13.165

04:05:13.231 --> 04:05:14.833
AND NEGOTIATE THOSE RATES BY

04:09:46.071 --> 04:09:47.672
INTENSE CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW

04:09:47.739 --> 04:09:48.406
TO DEAL WITH.

ATTEMPTED TO EMULATE FOR THIS

04:09:58.683 --> 04:10:00.785
BILL -- AND SO WHAT WE WANT TO

04:10:00.852 --> 04:10:02.487
DO IS TO PROTECT THE PATIENT BUT

04:10:02.554 --> 04:10:04.155
ALSO ENSURE THAT THERE WAS SOME

04:10:04.222 --> 04:10:06.157
PREDICTABILITY AS TO WITH

04:10:06.224 --> 04:10:07.058
REGARDS TO WHAT THE PAYMENTS

04:10:07.125 --> 04:10:09.594

THAT THE CHAIRMAN HAS ASKED AND

04:10:11.329 --> 04:10:12.497
AND BY THE WAY I WOULD SAY THAT

04:10:12.564 --> 04:10:13.598
WHEN WE STRUCTURED IT WE

04:10:13.665 --> 04:10:14.566
STRUCTURE TO TO GIVE THE

04:10:14.632 --> 04:10:16.000

HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS TO A

04:10:48.967 --> 04:10:51.102

04:11:33.077 --> 04:11:37.682
PREMISE AS FAR AS THE PATIENT

04:11:37.749 --> 04:11:37.882
SEEN.

04:11:37.949 --> 04:11:39.551
OUR THIS AMOUNT AFTER BEING

04:11:39.617 --> 04:11:40.852
TREATED IS SOMETHING THAT THAT

04:11:40.919 --> 04:11:41.886
WE'VE ALREADY THAT'S A PART THAT

04:11:41.953 --> 04:11:43.455
I AGREE -- THE PART THAT WE WANT

04:11:43.521 --> 04:11:45.256
TO LOOK AT IS THE RATE SETTING

04:11:45.323 --> 04:11:47.192
AND LOOKING AT THAT DEFAULT AND

04:11:47.258 --> 04:11:48.493
THEIR MEMBERS THAT WERE OFFERED

04:11:48.560 --> 04:11:50.195
AS FAR AS TAKING TAKING THAT

04:11:50.261 --> 04:11:51.095
BENCHMARK IN THOSE TYPES OF

04:11:51.162 --> 04:11:51.863
THINGS OUT.

04:11:51.930 --> 04:11:52.363
THING GOES IN THE RIGHT

04:11:52.430 --> 04:11:54.833
DIRECTION BUT CONTINUING TO LOOK

04:11:54.899 --> 04:11:55.967
AT THE DIALOGUE MOVING FORWARD.

04:11:56.034 --> 04:11:57.735
GREAT AND ONE OTHER THING I WANT

04:11:57.802 --> 04:11:58.736
TO MENTION -- WE'VE AMENDMENTS

04:11:58.803 --> 04:12:00.104
TO MAKE CLEAR THAT QUOTE IF

04:12:00.171 --> 04:12:02.073
DISSATISFIED EITHER PARTY MAY

04:12:02.140 --> 04:12:03.374
PURSUE ANY RIGHT REMEDY OR

04:12:03.441 --> 04:12:05.243
PENALTY ESTABLISH UNDER ANY

04:12:05.310 --> 04:12:06.478
OTHER APPLICABLE LAW SO IN OTHER

04:12:06.544 --> 04:12:06.945
WORDS.

04:12:07.011 --> 04:12:08.880
WE ENVISION IF THERE ARE ISSUES

04:12:08.947 --> 04:12:10.548
THAT THESE COULD BE RESOLVED IN

04:12:10.615 --> 04:12:11.216
A DIFFERENT SETTING BUT OUR HOPE

04:12:11.282 --> 04:12:12.717
IS AGAIN THIS CREATES A

04:12:12.784 --> 04:12:14.686
STRUCTURE -- TO RESOLVE THESE

04:12:14.752 --> 04:12:16.421
ISSUES QUICKLY BUT AGAIN POINT

04:12:16.488 --> 04:12:19.357
WELL TAKEN AND I WILL ABSOLUTELY --

04:12:19.424 --> 04:12:22.193
MAKE SURE THAT I KEEP YOU

04:12:22.260 --> 04:12:25.230

BRINGING THIS FORWARD I'LL BE

04:12:27.999 --> 04:12:29.901
VOTING FOR YOUR BILL TODAY --

04:12:29.968 --> 04:12:31.669
I'M A STRONG PROPONENT OF STRAW

04:12:31.736 --> 04:12:33.571
A STRONG SUPPORTER OF PROVISIONS

04:12:33.638 --> 04:12:35.306
TO PREVENT -- PROHIBIT BALANCE

04:12:35.373 --> 04:12:36.875
BILLING PROTECT PATIENTS FROM

04:12:36.941 --> 04:12:38.376
UNEXPECTED BILLS.

04:12:38.443 --> 04:12:40.078
I DO HAVE CONCERNS OF THE RAPE

04:12:40.144 --> 04:12:42.313
BILLING -- PIECE OF THE BILL

04:12:42.380 --> 04:12:43.448
HOWEVER THEN AMENDMENTS ARE NEW

04:12:43.515 --> 04:12:44.749
AND I REALLY WANT TO SPEND SOME

04:12:44.816 --> 04:12:46.217
TIME WITH MY LOCALS TO MAKE SURE

04:12:46.284 --> 04:12:47.886
THAT THEY FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH

04:12:47.952 --> 04:12:49.621
THOSE BEFORE.

04:12:49.687 --> 04:12:50.255
I MOVE ONCE ONCE WE GET TO THE

04:12:50.321 --> 04:12:51.923
FLOOR I WILL HAVE TO HAVE A

04:12:51.990 --> 04:12:53.057
DISCUSSION AT THAT POINT.

04:12:53.124 --> 04:12:57.762
I WILL ADD YOU TO THAT LIST

04:12:57.829 --> 04:13:03.268
THANK YOU.

04:13:03.334 --> 04:13:04.536
WE CAN WE CAN HEAR YOUR VOICE

04:13:04.602 --> 04:13:04.836
[inaudible]

04:13:04.903 --> 04:13:05.503
FOR CLEARLY.

04:13:05.570 --> 04:13:06.371
I DON'T WANT TO BELABOR THE

04:13:06.437 --> 04:13:07.038
POINT ANYTHING I JUST WILL THANK

04:13:07.105 --> 04:13:08.172
YOU FOR BEING WILLING TO

04:13:08.239 --> 04:13:09.674
CONSIDER A CONVERSATION ON THE

04:13:09.741 --> 04:13:10.875
RATE SETTING OUT I'LL JUST A

04:13:10.942 --> 04:13:13.177
LINE MY COMMENTS WITH MY

04:13:13.244 --> 04:13:14.812
COLLEAGUES HAVE ALREADY SPOKEN

04:13:14.879 --> 04:13:15.113
[inaudible]

04:13:15.179 --> 04:13:18.983
ANYONE ELSE -- JUST JUST COMMENT

04:13:19.050 --> 04:13:20.118
OR QUESTION YOU KNOW QUESTION

04:13:20.184 --> 04:13:22.420
HERE AND OBVIOUSLY WE WORK

04:13:22.487 --> 04:13:23.655
CLOSELY WITH YOU IN THIS BILL IS

04:13:23.721 --> 04:13:25.290
NOW SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT IN

04:13:25.356 --> 04:13:26.591
IN A COUPLE OF AREAS.

04:13:26.658 --> 04:13:28.493
SO I HEARD FROM MISTER PALES

04:13:28.560 --> 04:13:30.094
REGARDING TEN HOSPITALS IN THAT

04:13:30.161 --> 04:13:31.429
THE DESIRE TO TAKE THE PATIENT

04:13:31.496 --> 04:13:32.897
OUT OF THIS AND SOUNDS LIKE THE

04:13:32.964 --> 04:13:35.667
HOSPITAL THEN GOES AFTER WHOEVER

04:13:35.733 --> 04:13:36.634
TO GET PAID.

04:13:36.701 --> 04:13:37.535
IS THAT THE SAME GONNA BE THE

04:13:37.602 --> 04:13:39.771
SAME FOR ALL FOUR HUNDRED AND

04:13:39.837 --> 04:13:40.705
SOMETHING OTHER HOSPITALS IN

04:13:40.772 --> 04:13:42.073
CALIFORNIA WAS THAT COULD BE

04:13:42.140 --> 04:13:46.678
JUST PECULIAR -- TO MISTER TO

04:13:46.744 --> 04:13:47.011
MISTER THERE.

04:13:47.078 --> 04:13:48.846
THIS IS [inaudible]

04:13:48.913 --> 04:13:50.148
LANCE.

04:13:50.214 --> 04:13:51.749
SO AND SO AND IF WE IF THERE IS

04:13:51.816 --> 04:13:53.184
NO RATE COMPONENT.

04:13:53.251 --> 04:13:54.018
HOW AND HOW DO YOU TAKE THE

04:13:54.085 --> 04:13:55.486
PATIENT OUT TO PROTECT THE

04:13:55.553 --> 04:13:57.689
PATIENT?

04:13:57.755 --> 04:13:59.057
HOW DO YOU SO OUR OUR HOSPITALS

04:13:59.123 --> 04:14:01.392
WOULD GO AFTER THE INSURERS I

04:14:01.459 --> 04:14:04.629
THINK THAT QUESTION WE HAVE IN --

04:14:04.696 --> 04:14:06.197
TENANTS AMENDMENTS IS HOW YOU

04:14:06.264 --> 04:14:08.132
FIGURE OUT WHO THE INSURER IS IF

04:14:08.199 --> 04:14:09.500
THE PATIENT ISN'T AVAILABLE TO

04:14:09.567 --> 04:14:11.369
TELL YOU THAT SO I THINK WE NEED

04:14:11.436 --> 04:14:12.971
TO WORK THROUGH THAT TECHNICALLY

04:14:13.037 --> 04:14:14.138
AND I THINK WE'VE.

04:14:14.205 --> 04:14:16.474
SEEN OTHER BILLS IN THAT SPACE --

04:14:16.541 --> 04:14:19.444
BUT WE NOW GO AFTER.

04:14:19.510 --> 04:14:22.313
YOU KNOW IF WE HAVE IF WE HAVE A

04:14:22.380 --> 04:14:24.349
PLACE WHERE WE'RE NOT BILLING --

04:14:24.415 --> 04:14:25.984
THE PATIENTS WHICH THERE ARE

04:14:26.050 --> 04:14:27.085
THERE ARE THERE'S EXISTING LAW

04:14:27.151 --> 04:14:29.087
THEN WE GO TO THE INSURER AND

04:14:29.153 --> 04:14:30.855
USE THE CURRENT SYSTEM TO WORK

04:14:30.922 --> 04:14:31.422
THAT I THINK I'M TRYING TO

04:14:31.489 --> 04:14:32.390
UNDERSTAND.

04:14:32.457 --> 04:14:33.658
WHICH PATIENTS WERE TALKING

04:14:33.725 --> 04:14:34.792
ABOUT HERE AND THE ARREST SO WE

04:14:34.859 --> 04:14:36.127
WOULD GO AFTER THE PATIENT

04:14:36.194 --> 04:14:37.729
PROVIDES US WITH THEIR PLAN

04:14:37.795 --> 04:14:38.963
INFORMATION WE WOULD GO AFTER

04:14:39.030 --> 04:14:40.832
THAT BUT IF WE CAN'T BILL THE

04:14:40.898 --> 04:14:42.233
PATIENT AT ALL.

04:14:42.300 --> 04:14:44.369
THEN I GUESS I HAVE THE SAME

04:14:44.435 --> 04:14:46.037
QUESTION IS HOW DO YOU.

04:14:46.104 --> 04:14:47.105
HOW DO YOU FIND OUT WHO THE

04:14:47.171 --> 04:14:50.475
INSURED IT SURE IS?

04:14:50.541 --> 04:14:52.677
OTHER THAN THE PATIENT JUST

04:14:52.744 --> 04:14:54.078
LETTING YOU NOW.

04:14:54.145 --> 04:14:55.113
THE SERVICE AND THEN AND IN THIS

04:14:55.179 --> 04:14:56.214
CAPACITY I THINK THERE'SWAYS TO

04:14:56.280 --> 04:14:56.681
DO THAT.

04:14:56.748 --> 04:14:58.483
YEAH SO I THINK GENERALLY THE

04:14:58.549 --> 04:15:00.585
THE WAY WE ENVISION OPERATE AND

04:15:00.652 --> 04:15:02.353
BY THE WAY THIS IS THE WAY WE

04:15:02.420 --> 04:15:03.788
OPERATE CURRENTLY.

04:15:03.855 --> 04:15:06.057
IS WHAT WE'LL DO IS WE'LL HAVE

04:15:06.124 --> 04:15:09.360
TO FIND OUT FROM THE PATIENT.

04:15:09.427 --> 04:15:11.062
WHO THAT -- PAYER AS WE WILL

04:15:11.129 --> 04:15:12.196
FIND THE PAIR WE WILL FIND THE

04:15:12.263 --> 04:15:14.632
POLICY WE'LL FIND OUT WHAT

04:15:14.699 --> 04:15:16.467
RIGHTS THE PATIENT HAS.

04:15:16.534 --> 04:15:18.036
UNDER THAT POLICY RELATIVE TO

04:15:18.102 --> 04:15:20.405
EMERGENCY ROOM COVERAGE WE WILL

04:15:20.471 --> 04:15:24.909
BAND JUST BILL -- THAT PORTION

04:15:24.976 --> 04:15:27.378
THAT WOULD BE SPECIFIED IN THEIR

04:15:27.445 --> 04:15:28.746
POLICY IN OTHER WORDS IF THERE

04:15:28.813 --> 04:15:30.381
POLICY PROVIDES FOR AN IN

04:15:30.448 --> 04:15:33.951
NETWORK CHARGE NOT TO EXCEED.

04:15:34.018 --> 04:15:34.552
SEVEN FIFTY DOLLARS THAT'S ALL

04:15:34.619 --> 04:15:35.887
WE WOULD BILL.

04:15:35.953 --> 04:15:37.588
AND THEN WHAT WAS WE DON'T HAVE

04:15:37.655 --> 04:15:39.590
A PROBLEM WITH THAT BECAUSE WHAT

04:15:39.657 --> 04:15:41.125
WE WANT TO STILL BE ABLE TO DO.

04:15:41.192 --> 04:15:43.161
IS GO AFTER THE PAIR FOR EVER

04:15:43.227 --> 04:15:45.129
AMOUNTS WE BELIEVE ARE CURRENTLY

04:15:45.196 --> 04:15:46.664
DRIVEN BY THE GUIDELINES THE

04:15:46.731 --> 04:15:48.332
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN AB SEVENTY

04:15:48.399 --> 04:15:50.068
TWO IN THE DEFAULT RATE SENT SET

04:15:50.134 --> 04:15:50.802
THERE.

04:15:50.868 --> 04:15:52.003
IS THAT MATIN VARMINT YOU TALK

04:15:52.070 --> 04:15:53.471
ABOUT KNOCKS KEEN REGULATED

04:15:53.538 --> 04:15:54.672
PLANS.

04:15:54.739 --> 04:15:57.008
SO THOSE THOSE HALF OR OR

04:15:57.075 --> 04:15:58.509
PROVIDER SO THERE THERE YOU

04:15:58.576 --> 04:16:00.244
HAPPEN NETWORK OUT US ADEQUACY

04:16:00.311 --> 04:16:02.146
REQUIREMENTS. FOR A FOR EXAMPLE

04:16:02.213 --> 04:16:04.115
A RISA PLAN THERE'S NO NETWORK

04:16:04.182 --> 04:16:07.952
ADEQUACY REQUIREMENTS SO WITHOUT

04:16:08.019 --> 04:16:09.587
THAT STICK.

04:16:09.654 --> 04:16:10.321
WE WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE

04:16:10.388 --> 04:16:11.556
DEFAULT RATE IS.

04:16:11.622 --> 04:16:13.357
IS EFFECTIVE IN ENSURING THAT

04:16:13.424 --> 04:16:14.992
THERE'S CONTRACT CONTRACTS GOING

04:16:15.059 --> 04:16:17.795
BOTH WAYS WHICH ULTIMATELY ON

04:16:17.862 --> 04:16:20.398
THE BEST INTEREST OF THE PATIENT.

04:16:20.465 --> 04:16:21.365
SKIP.

04:16:21.432 --> 04:16:22.300
MISTER CHAIR IF I MAY.

04:16:22.366 --> 04:16:26.104
UM SEVERAL POINTS MUD BUT TO

04:16:26.170 --> 04:16:29.240
WOVEN TOGETHER HERE LET ME SAY

04:16:29.307 --> 04:16:31.676
IT THAT WAY -- MOST AS YOU

04:16:31.743 --> 04:16:33.244
PROBABLY KNOW BETTER THAN WE

04:16:33.311 --> 04:16:34.345
WE'VE DISCOVERED THAT MOST

04:16:34.412 --> 04:16:35.980
BILLING DONE.

04:16:36.047 --> 04:16:37.115
IN HEALTH CARE IS DONE

04:16:37.181 --> 04:16:39.984
ELECTRONICALLY AND IS DONE BY A

04:16:40.051 --> 04:16:41.319
HANDFUL OF COMPANIES.

04:16:41.385 --> 04:16:43.521
THERE IT IS POSSIBLE TO KNOW IF

04:16:43.588 --> 04:16:44.822
YOU KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT THE

04:16:44.889 --> 04:16:46.324
PATIENT WHO THEIR COVERAGE IS

04:16:46.390 --> 04:16:48.126
THROUGH SO I THINK THAT'S A

04:16:48.192 --> 04:16:49.761
WORKABLE PROBLEM BUT WE ARE

04:16:49.827 --> 04:16:51.863
ALWAYS WILLING TO SIT DOWN AND

04:16:51.929 --> 04:16:53.364
WORK THROUGH PRACTICAL PROBLEMS.

04:16:53.431 --> 04:16:57.935
WITH RESPECT TO THE DEFAULT RATE

04:16:58.002 --> 04:17:00.705
I THINK YOUR QUESTION WENT TO

04:17:00.772 --> 04:17:02.540
THE ISSUE OF WHAT IS THE LEAST

04:17:02.607 --> 04:17:04.108
IN A PIECE THE ONE OF THE THINGS

04:17:04.175 --> 04:17:05.676
WE DISCOVERED IN AB SEVENTY TWO

04:17:05.743 --> 04:17:06.711
THIS IS IN FACT.

04:17:06.778 --> 04:17:07.912
THAT THERE IS A LOT OF LUCK

04:17:07.979 --> 04:17:09.113
TRYING TO BILLING GOING ON

04:17:09.180 --> 04:17:12.784
ALREADY IN THE BILLING COMPANIES

04:17:12.850 --> 04:17:14.285
WITH RESPECT TO THE DEFAULT RATE

04:17:14.352 --> 04:17:16.254
IS WE'VE INVOKED AB SEVENTY TWO

04:17:16.320 --> 04:17:17.321
THE RATE THERE WAS A HUNDRED THE

04:17:17.388 --> 04:17:20.758
GREATER OF A 125% OF MEDICARE OR

04:17:20.825 --> 04:17:22.226
THE AVERAGE CONTRACTED RATE.

04:17:22.293 --> 04:17:23.728
WE ARE PROPOSED TO USE THE SAME

04:17:23.795 --> 04:17:25.062
METHODOLOGY FOR THE AVERAGE

04:17:25.129 --> 04:17:27.165
CONTRACTED RATE HERE WHICH IS

04:17:27.231 --> 04:17:29.133
THE AVERAGE CONTRACTED RATE. FOR

04:17:29.200 --> 04:17:30.701
THAT SERVICE FOR THAT HEALTH

04:17:30.768 --> 04:17:33.237
PLAN FOR THAT GEOGRAPHIC AREA WE

04:17:33.304 --> 04:17:34.605
ARE OF COURSE ALWAYS WILLING TO

04:17:34.672 --> 04:17:36.941
HAVE FURTHER CONVERSATION --

04:17:37.008 --> 04:17:39.577
WITH THE OPPOSITION ABOUT YOU

04:17:39.644 --> 04:17:44.515
KNOW AS WE MOVE FORWARD AS OUR

04:17:44.582 --> 04:17:47.518
AUTHOR HAS SENT.

04:17:47.585 --> 04:17:48.753
I'M STILL AND IN OBVIOUS IS A

04:17:48.820 --> 04:17:51.122
WORK IN PROGRESS AND IT'S IT'S

04:17:51.189 --> 04:17:52.456
COMPLICATED I'VE.

04:17:52.523 --> 04:17:53.958
LOOK I WE LIVE TO AB SEVENTY TWO

04:17:54.025 --> 04:17:55.493
THIS IS LIKE THE GIFT THAT KEEPS

04:17:55.560 --> 04:17:57.128
ON GIVING QUITE FRANKLY --

04:17:57.195 --> 04:17:58.329
BECAUSE IT IT IS HAS BECOME

04:17:58.396 --> 04:18:00.264
INCREDIBLY COMPLICATED AND THERE

04:18:00.331 --> 04:18:02.200
ARE OTHER CHALLENGES AND AND NOW

04:18:02.266 --> 04:18:03.634
WE'RE NOW WE'RE LOOKING AT THAT

04:18:03.701 --> 04:18:05.503
THIS ASPECT OF IT RELATED TO

04:18:05.570 --> 04:18:10.908
EMERGENCY CARE -- I'M JUST STILL.

04:18:10.975 --> 04:18:12.510
MAYBE IT'S LATE AB I MY BLOOD

04:18:12.577 --> 04:18:13.544
SUGAR IS LOW -- ALL OF THOSE

04:18:13.611 --> 04:18:15.513
THINGS BUT I'M STILL A LITTLE

04:18:15.580 --> 04:18:17.849
PUZZLED THAT YOU KNOW I I GUESS

04:18:17.915 --> 04:18:19.217
I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW.

04:18:19.283 --> 04:18:20.284
THAT.

04:18:20.351 --> 04:18:22.320
EVERY HOSPITAL IS GOING TO DO

04:18:22.386 --> 04:18:24.155
LIKEWISE.

04:18:24.222 --> 04:18:25.690
REGARDLESS AND TAKE THE PATIENT

04:18:25.756 --> 04:18:27.058
OUT OF THIS THAT'S THAT WILL

04:18:27.124 --> 04:18:28.526
THAT WOULD BE THE INTENT YES

04:18:28.593 --> 04:18:31.362
EXACTLY INTENT BUT IT BUT WHAT

04:18:31.429 --> 04:18:32.763
WE DON'T KNOW THAT ALL ALL

04:18:32.830 --> 04:18:34.265
HOSPITALS WILL ACTUALLY DO THAT.

04:18:34.332 --> 04:18:36.267
I I THINK THAT TO BOTH --

04:18:36.334 --> 04:18:38.302
SPONSORED BOTH THE SPONSOR AND

04:18:38.369 --> 04:18:39.670
THE OWES PERSPECTIVE AND THEN ON

04:18:39.737 --> 04:18:41.505
PREVIOUS WORK WE'VE DONE -- I

04:18:41.572 --> 04:18:43.307
DON'T KNOW MY HOSPITALS ALL OF

04:18:43.374 --> 04:18:45.543
THEIR ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS BUT THE

04:18:45.610 --> 04:18:46.878
IDEA WOULD YOU YOU KNOW THERE'S

04:18:46.944 --> 04:18:48.212
DIFFERENT WAYS IN WHICH YOU CAN

04:18:48.279 --> 04:18:50.581
FIGURE OUT IF THE PATIENT.

04:18:50.648 --> 04:18:52.450
HAS INSURANCE.

04:18:52.516 --> 04:18:53.684
SO AND IF THEY DON'T HAVE

04:18:53.751 --> 04:18:54.652
INSURANCE AND THERE'S CHARITY

04:18:54.719 --> 04:18:55.920
CARE POLITIES POLICIES THAT THEY

04:18:55.987 --> 04:18:57.455
CAN THEN VISIT BUT IF THERE

04:18:57.521 --> 04:18:58.589
THERE'S WAYS TO FIGURE I THINK

04:18:58.656 --> 04:19:00.091
WE WOULD WORK TO FIND THOSE WAYS

04:19:00.157 --> 04:19:01.692
OUT I I JUST CAN'T SPEAK FOR

04:19:01.759 --> 04:19:05.396
EVERY ELECTRONIC SYSTEM IN THAT --

04:19:05.463 --> 04:19:07.198
TO TO ASSURE YOU TODAY THAT THEY

04:19:07.265 --> 04:19:07.965
COULD LOOK AT ALTERNATIVE

04:19:08.032 --> 04:19:09.533
OPTIONS LIKE TEN IT DOES BUT I'M

04:19:09.600 --> 04:19:11.135
SURE MANY OF THEM BEHIND ME

04:19:11.202 --> 04:19:15.106
RIGHT NOW ARE NODDING THAT THEY

04:19:15.172 --> 04:19:16.607
DO THAT ALREADY.

04:19:16.674 --> 04:19:17.642
I GUESS BECAUSE THE INTENT OF

04:19:17.708 --> 04:19:19.010
THE BILL WE'RE TRYING TO ENSURE

04:19:19.076 --> 04:19:20.711
IS TO GET THE PAY IS NOT MAKE

04:19:20.778 --> 04:19:22.013
SURE THAT THE PAIN WE ARE OUT OF

04:19:22.079 --> 04:19:23.714
THIS AND AND SO -- SO I HEAR

04:19:23.781 --> 04:19:25.249
THAT ONE HOSPITAL SYSTEM.

04:19:25.316 --> 04:19:26.017
KIND OF DOES THAT ALREADY.

04:19:26.083 --> 04:19:26.584
YEAH SOUNDS LIKE IT I JUST

04:19:26.651 --> 04:19:28.052
DIDN'T HAVE ASSURANCE FROM EVERY

04:19:28.119 --> 04:19:30.021
SYSTEM AS I WALKED UP HERE THAT

04:19:30.087 --> 04:19:31.622
THEY HAVE THE SYSTEM BUT I I

04:19:31.689 --> 04:19:32.657
HAVE A HARD TIME BELIEVING THAT

04:19:32.723 --> 04:19:33.858
THEY HAVE THEY COULDN'T FIGURE

04:19:33.925 --> 04:19:35.226
IT OUT SO TO GET THE PATIENT ON

04:19:35.293 --> 04:19:35.760
THE METAL.

04:19:35.826 --> 04:19:36.961
I THINK OUR BIGGEST STRUGGLE

04:19:37.028 --> 04:19:38.296
LIKE WE SAID IS THAT DEFAULT

04:19:38.362 --> 04:19:39.764
RATE SO THEN WHEN SO NOW YOU'RE

04:19:39.830 --> 04:19:41.332
TALKING ABOUT THE HOSPITAL NOW

04:19:41.399 --> 04:19:42.333
TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THEIR

04:19:42.400 --> 04:19:46.070
REGIONAL RATE IS -- FOR THE PLAN

04:19:46.137 --> 04:19:48.239
AND THEN FIGURE OUT WHAT THAT

04:19:48.306 --> 04:19:49.840
BUILDING IS GOING TO BE IN A

04:19:49.907 --> 04:19:50.474
SIMILAR KNOWLEDGE I THINK THERE

04:19:50.541 --> 04:19:52.009
IS A MYTH METHODOLOGY FOR THAT

04:19:52.076 --> 04:19:54.111
AND AND I THINK OUR CONCERN IS

04:19:54.178 --> 04:19:54.745
THAT IT'S GOING TO DRIVE THREE

04:19:54.812 --> 04:20:00.184
TIMES BUT WE WE DON'T HAVE TO

04:20:00.251 --> 04:20:02.753
REHASH THAT.

04:20:02.820 --> 04:20:05.623
ONE SO OKAY WELL.

04:20:05.690 --> 04:20:06.223
BUT ALSO CASH OBVIOUSLY THERE

04:20:06.290 --> 04:20:07.591
ISN'T ANY RESIDUE AYE I KNOW THE

04:20:07.658 --> 04:20:09.126
AUTHORS COMMITTED TO AND I KNOW

04:20:09.193 --> 04:20:09.694
THAT THEIR WE CONTINUE COULD

04:20:09.760 --> 04:20:10.027
DISCUSSIONS.

04:20:10.094 --> 04:20:12.830
AND I PLAN TO FOLLOW THEM VERY

04:20:12.897 --> 04:20:14.231
CLOSELY.

04:20:14.298 --> 04:20:16.567
SO -- SO I THEBILL DOES HAVE A

04:20:16.634 --> 04:20:17.068
TO PASS AS AMENDED TO

04:20:17.134 --> 04:20:23.040

04:51:10.019 --> 04:51:12.021
INAPPROPRIATELY DETERMINED IN

04:51:12.087 --> 04:51:13.455

04:51:16.192 --> 04:51:17.760
MULTIPLE FACTORS ARE TAKEN INTO

04:51:17.827 --> 04:51:19.261
CONSIDERATION BY THE PLANT AND

04:51:19.328 --> 04:51:20.496
THIS BILL FAILS TO TAKE INTO

04:51:20.563 --> 04:51:21.297
ACCOUNT THE REDUCTION OF

04:51:21.363 --> 04:51:25.568

04:51:29.672 --> 04:51:30.906
AND SO IT AS I PRESENTED WITH

04:51:30.973 --> 04:51:31.407
EARLIER.

04:51:31.473 --> 04:51:32.575
BILLS EARLIER TODAY WE JUST

04:51:32.641 --> 04:51:33.175
DON'T SUPPORT.

04:51:33.242 --> 04:51:34.210
ON ANY BILLS ARE GOING TO

04:51:34.276 --> 04:51:35.511
INCREASE THE PREMIUMS ARE --

04:51:35.578 --> 04:51:37.413
COPAYMENTS FOR PARMALEE THANK

04:51:37.479 --> 04:51:41.150
YOU. SEVENTY ONE CAN FINALLY

04:51:41.217 --> 04:51:41.784
HAPPENED THE ASSOCIATION

04:51:41.851 --> 04:51:42.885
CALIFORNIA LIFE AND HEALTH

04:51:42.952 --> 04:51:44.620
INSURANCE COMPANIES WITH ECHO

04:51:44.687 --> 04:51:45.221
MANY OF THE COMMENTS FROM MY

04:51:45.287 --> 04:51:46.989
COLLEAGUE I THINK OUR MEMBERS

04:51:47.056 --> 04:51:48.591
ABSOLUTELY SUPPORT TELEHEALTH WE

04:51:48.657 --> 04:51:50.226
SEE IT AS A VITAL.

04:51:50.292 --> 04:51:52.995
INNOVATIVE OPTION FOR PATIENTS

04:51:53.062 --> 04:51:54.630
TO GET THEM A LOT OF TIME.

04:51:54.697 --> 04:51:55.831
A LOT OF FLEXIBILITY WITH PEOPLE

04:51:55.898 --> 04:51:57.600
WITH FAMILIES AND OTHER OPTIONS

04:51:57.666 --> 04:51:59.501
TO USE THAT UNFORTUNATELY THIS

04:51:59.568 --> 04:52:00.769
BILL REALLY DOES MANDATE

04:52:00.836 --> 04:52:02.938
CONTRACT NEGOTIATION TERMS IN

04:52:03.005 --> 04:52:04.306
STATUTE.

04:52:04.373 --> 04:52:05.674
AND WE WOULD LIKE TO ALSO POINT

04:52:05.741 --> 04:52:07.610
OUT THAT IT DOES PREVENT US FROM

04:52:07.676 --> 04:52:09.078
SO SOURCE CONTRACTING SOME OF

04:52:09.144 --> 04:52:10.412
OUR MEMBERS DO YOU USE THIRD

04:52:10.479 --> 04:52:11.947
PARTY VENDORS THEY'RE ABLE TO

04:52:12.014 --> 04:52:12.948
NEGOTIATE BETTER RATES WITH

04:52:13.015 --> 04:52:14.350
THOSE VENDORS PROVIDE THESE

04:52:14.416 --> 04:52:15.518
VITAL SERVICES.

04:52:15.584 --> 04:52:16.886
WHICH THEN EQUATES TO LOWER

04:52:16.952 --> 04:52:18.554
PREMIUMS FOR OUR MEMBERS SO YET

04:52:18.621 --> 04:52:20.189
AGAIN IN A TIME WHEN WE ARE

04:52:20.256 --> 04:52:23.158
INCREDIBLY PRICE SENSITIVE.

04:52:23.225 --> 04:52:24.126
WE WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT.

04:52:24.193 --> 04:52:26.362
THESE OPTIONS OF NEGOTIATING

04:52:26.428 --> 04:52:28.597
THESE PRICES DO. FOR WAR AT THAT

04:52:28.664 --> 04:52:31.934
CONSUMERS WITH LOWER PREMIUMS

04:52:32.001 --> 04:52:32.501
AND FOR THOSE REASONS WE ARE

04:52:32.568 --> 04:52:35.137
OPPOSED THE BILL.

04:52:35.204 --> 04:52:36.672
THANK YOU OTHERS IN OPPOSITION.

04:52:36.739 --> 04:52:37.473
JOHN WINGER ON BEHALF AMERICA'S

04:52:37.539 --> 04:52:39.074
HEALTH INSURANCE PLANS WOULD

04:52:39.141 --> 04:52:40.209
ECHO THE COMMENTS THAT CAPITA

04:52:40.276 --> 04:52:40.409
CLICK.

04:52:40.476 --> 04:52:42.378
HERE.

04:52:42.444 --> 04:52:43.812
KAREN SIR KISSING WITH THE

04:52:43.879 --> 04:52:45.180
CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE

04:52:45.247 --> 04:52:46.548
IN A BOOK IN OPPOSITION THANK

04:52:46.615 --> 04:52:47.516
YOU [inaudible]

04:52:47.583 --> 04:52:49.018
ANYONE ELSE.

04:52:49.084 --> 04:52:50.286
BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR

04:52:50.352 --> 04:52:52.621
QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS QUESTIONS

04:52:52.688 --> 04:52:56.825
COMES FROM COMING.

04:52:56.892 --> 04:52:58.460
MIKE I GUESS MY QUESTION IS I'M

04:52:58.527 --> 04:52:59.828
I I GUESS I'M STILL A LITTLE

04:52:59.895 --> 04:53:00.829
PUZZLED AS TO WHY.

04:53:00.896 --> 04:53:02.364
YOU THE HEALTH PLANS FEEL THIS

04:53:02.431 --> 04:53:06.602
IS GOING TO INCREASE COSTS.

04:53:06.669 --> 04:53:07.770
ON THE WAY THAT THE BILL WAS

04:53:07.836 --> 04:53:09.104
DRAFTED ACCORDING TO THE CHEAPER

04:53:09.171 --> 04:53:10.906
BUT NOW SAYS DO THE INCREASE

04:53:10.973 --> 04:53:12.675
UTILIZATION TELL HEALTH SERVICES

04:53:12.741 --> 04:53:14.310
AT THE RATE SPECIFIED IN THE

04:53:14.376 --> 04:53:14.944
BILL.

04:53:15.010 --> 04:53:16.312
IT'S ANTICIPATED INCREASE

04:53:16.378 --> 04:53:18.013
PREMIUMS BY TWO HUNDRED MILLION

04:53:18.080 --> 04:53:20.349
AN OUT OF POCKET EXPENSES FOR

04:53:20.416 --> 04:53:21.383
ENROLLEES FIFTY MILLION.

04:53:21.450 --> 04:53:22.918
SO THIS INCREASED UTILIZATION

04:53:22.985 --> 04:53:25.020
MIGHT BE FROM PEOPLE WHO MIGHT

04:53:25.087 --> 04:53:26.889
APPEAL TO ACCESS A DOCTOR.

04:53:26.956 --> 04:53:28.624
BECAUSE THEY LIVE IN A REALLY

04:53:28.691 --> 04:53:29.658
POOR COMMUNITY.

04:53:29.725 --> 04:53:30.693
OR THEY CAN'T THEY DON'T HAVE

04:53:30.759 --> 04:53:32.394
THE RESOURCES TO DRIVE TO THREE

04:53:32.461 --> 04:53:35.064
HOURS LIKE OUR HOSPITAL CEO DID.

04:53:35.130 --> 04:53:36.598
SO.

04:53:36.665 --> 04:53:40.235
IS THIS NOT POTENTIALLY.

04:53:40.302 --> 04:53:41.971
KIND OF A DIAL OF CARE.

04:53:42.037 --> 04:53:43.305
I'M I THINK OUR MEMBERS WOULD

04:53:43.372 --> 04:53:44.606
ABSOLUTELY SUGGEST THE THE

04:53:44.673 --> 04:53:46.542
INTENT IS NOT TO DENY CARE NOT

04:53:46.608 --> 04:53:47.743
TO GIVE PEOPLE ACCESS I MEAN WE

04:53:47.810 --> 04:53:48.911
REALLY APPRECIATE THE

04:53:48.978 --> 04:53:50.112
FLEXIBILITY THAT TELL HEALTH

04:53:50.179 --> 04:53:50.813
KIDS.

04:53:50.879 --> 04:53:52.214
I THINK THE CONCERN WOULD BE FOR

04:53:52.281 --> 04:53:54.883
US IS THAT AS WE NEGOTIATE THE

04:53:54.950 --> 04:53:56.085
CONTRACTS.

04:53:56.151 --> 04:53:57.653
SO SAFE WE USE A THIRD PARTY

04:53:57.720 --> 04:53:59.555
VENDOR AS AN OPTION WERE ABLE TO

04:53:59.621 --> 04:54:01.223
NEGOTIATE A BETTER CONTRACT IN

04:54:01.290 --> 04:54:02.825
THE CONTEXT THAT YOU'RE ACTUALLY

04:54:02.891 --> 04:54:04.126
GUARANTEEING THEM A CERTAIN SET

04:54:04.193 --> 04:54:05.327
OF ENROLLEES.

04:54:05.394 --> 04:54:06.562
THIS BILL WOULD TAKE AWAY THAT

04:54:06.628 --> 04:54:08.263
FLEXIBILITY FOR US TO DO THAT

04:54:08.330 --> 04:54:09.965
AND TÁI S. TO AN ESTABLISHED

04:54:10.032 --> 04:54:10.599
RATE.

04:54:10.666 --> 04:54:12.468
VERSUS US BEING ABLE TO

04:54:12.534 --> 04:54:14.103
NEGOTIATE A SECONDARY RATE WITH

04:54:14.169 --> 04:54:16.305
THE PROVIDER AND SO THAT THAT'S

04:54:16.372 --> 04:54:17.973
OUR CONCERN IS THAT WE THINK

04:54:18.040 --> 04:54:18.974
THAT THIS BILL REALLY DOES LIMIT

04:54:19.041 --> 04:54:20.976
OUR ABILITY TO NEGOTIATE RATES

04:54:21.043 --> 04:54:23.846
AND AND LOWER RATES FOR

04:54:23.912 --> 04:54:26.081
CONSUMERS.

04:54:26.148 --> 04:54:27.349
YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT.

04:54:27.416 --> 04:54:28.851
WELL -- SO THERE'S NO IN THE

04:54:28.917 --> 04:54:30.919
BILL LANGUAGE AB SEVEN FORTY

04:54:30.986 --> 04:54:32.388
FOUR ACTUALLY SET THE TELEHEALTH

04:54:32.454 --> 04:54:34.023
RATE REQUIRE THAT THE RATE BE --

04:54:34.089 --> 04:54:36.358
THE SAME AS AN IN PERSON RATE

04:54:36.425 --> 04:54:37.860
THIS BILL SEEKS TO ENSURE TELE

04:54:37.926 --> 04:54:39.661
HEALTH PARITY IT DOES NOT

04:54:39.728 --> 04:54:41.397
DICTATE RATE FOR SERVICES.

04:54:41.463 --> 04:54:43.565
SO.

04:54:43.632 --> 04:54:44.633
SOUNDS LIKE YOU AGREE TO

04:54:44.700 --> 04:54:48.804

PEOPLE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO

04:54:51.874 --> 04:54:52.941
HAVE HEALTH CARE.

04:54:53.008 --> 04:54:54.510

AMBIVALENT ABOUT THE BILL QUITE

05:04:30.819 --> 05:04:32.954
FRANKLY -- ON THE ONE HAND I

05:04:33.021 --> 05:04:35.323
UNDERSTAND THE NEED -- ACTUALLY

05:04:35.390 --> 05:04:36.891
I WAS THE ONE WHO COMMISSION THE

05:04:36.958 --> 05:04:38.994
AUDIT THAT WAS REFERENCED BY.

05:04:39.060 --> 05:04:40.929
BY BY HER BUT THAT ACTUALLY THAT

05:04:40.996 --> 05:04:42.998
ONLY YOUR POINTS WERE GERMANE TO

05:04:43.064 --> 05:04:44.799

05:04:48.903 --> 05:04:51.072
DELIVERED TO COUNTY MENTAL

05:04:51.139 --> 05:04:52.007
HEALTH PLANS.

05:04:52.073 --> 05:04:53.842
THAT'S HOW IT'S DONE -- COUNTIES

05:04:53.908 --> 05:04:54.976
RECEIVE DEDICATED REALIGNMENT

05:04:55.043 --> 05:04:56.811
REVENUE FOR THIS -- FOR THIS

05:04:56.878 --> 05:04:58.480
PURPOSE I KNOW THIS BILL LOCAL

05:04:58.546 --> 05:05:00.281
EDUCATION AGENCIES COULD ALSO

05:05:00.348 --> 05:05:01.616
USE PROP NINETY EIGHT MONEY

05:05:01.683 --> 05:05:03.652
WHICH WE TALKED ABOUT -- TO

05:05:03.718 --> 05:05:05.387
BUILD THE ACS THROUGH FEE FOR

05:05:05.453 --> 05:05:08.289
SERVICE OUTSIDE OF THE COUNTY

05:05:08.356 --> 05:05:09.658
MENTAL HEALTH PLAN STRUCTURE.

05:05:09.724 --> 05:05:10.258
SO MONEY IS SUPPOSED TO GO FOR

05:05:10.325 --> 05:05:12.027
EDUCATION WOULD GO FOR MENTAL

05:05:12.093 --> 05:05:13.061
HEALTH SERVICES AND MEDI CAL.

05:05:13.128 --> 05:05:14.863
AND THAT WERE ALREADY FUNDING

05:05:14.929 --> 05:05:16.598
WITH REALIGNMENT REVENUE.

05:05:16.665 --> 05:05:17.799
I UNDERSTAND SCHOOLS HAVE TO

05:05:17.866 --> 05:05:19.467
COMPLY WITH FEDERAL LAW AND

05:05:19.534 --> 05:05:21.302
ENCOURAGE THAT -- THAT REQUIRES

05:05:21.369 --> 05:05:22.103
MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES BE

05:05:22.170 --> 05:05:24.072
PROVIDED BUT I'DLIKE TO SEE A

05:05:24.139 --> 05:05:25.273
FIX ON THE ISSUE.

05:05:25.340 --> 05:05:28.143
AT ADDRESSES WHY SCHOOLS AND

05:05:28.209 --> 05:05:28.677
MENTAL HEALTH PLANS DON'T

05:05:28.743 --> 05:05:30.245
CONTRACT NOW.

05:05:30.311 --> 05:05:31.146
THAT WOULD BE MUCH SIMPLER.

05:05:31.212 --> 05:05:33.481
RATHER THAN SET UP A SEPARATE

05:05:33.548 --> 05:05:34.282
BILLING STRUCTURE.

05:05:34.349 --> 05:05:36.818
IN WHAT'S ALREADY A FRAGMENTED

05:05:36.885 --> 05:05:38.153
MENTAL HEALTH DELIVERY SYSTEM

05:05:38.219 --> 05:05:39.754
TRUST ME AS SOMEONE WHO BILL

05:05:39.821 --> 05:05:40.622
MEDI CAL.

05:05:40.689 --> 05:05:42.757
IT'S NOT EASY.

05:05:42.824 --> 05:05:44.359
IT'S NOT GONNA BE EASY I DON'T

05:05:44.426 --> 05:05:45.627
KNOW THAT THIS IS REALLY THE

05:05:45.694 --> 05:05:47.829
SOLUTION O HAVE SCHOOLS DO THIS.

05:05:47.896 --> 05:05:49.864
QUITE FRANKLY AND SO I I WON'T

05:05:49.931 --> 05:05:51.266
BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY I

05:05:51.332 --> 05:05:52.634
APPRECIATE THE INTENT.

05:05:52.701 --> 05:05:53.635
BUT I THINK WHAT WE'D REALLY

05:05:53.702 --> 05:05:55.136
LIKE TO SEE IS THAT SCHOOLS AND

05:05:55.203 --> 05:05:56.171
MENTAL HEALTH AND THE COUNTIES

05:05:56.237 --> 05:05:57.972
ACTUALLY WORK THIS OUT THE RIGHT

05:05:58.039 --> 05:06:01.142
WAY -- BUT THAT'S THAT THAT'S

05:06:01.209 --> 05:06:02.510
GONNA BE MY POSITION ON THE BILL

05:06:02.577 --> 05:06:06.414
TONIGHT SO.

05:06:06.481 --> 05:06:07.449
ANYBODY ELSE THE ACCOUNT

05:06:07.515 --> 05:06:07.749
[inaudible]

05:06:07.816 --> 05:06:09.751
RESPOND.

05:06:09.818 --> 05:06:10.752
IF I MAY ADD MISTER CHAIR I

05:06:10.819 --> 05:06:11.319
APPRECIATE THE THE CONCERN I

05:06:11.386 --> 05:06:12.253
THINK WHAT WE'RE FINDING WITH

05:06:12.320 --> 05:06:14.222
EXPERIENCE IS THAT -- THE

05:06:14.289 --> 05:06:15.290
ADDITIONAL HURDLE THAT IS

05:06:15.356 --> 05:06:17.158
REQUIRED BY CURRENT LAW IS

05:06:17.225 --> 05:06:18.626
SERVING AS A BARRIER TO ON

05:06:18.693 --> 05:06:20.862
WALKING FEDERAL FUNDS -- THAT

05:06:20.929 --> 05:06:22.097
THAT COULD BE AVAILABLE TO

05:06:22.163 --> 05:06:23.264
ACTUALLY HELP KIDS ARE K.

05:06:23.331 --> 05:06:25.667
THROUGH TWELVE SCHOOLS BUT IF IF

05:06:25.734 --> 05:06:26.835
YOU'LL ALLOW ME I'LL DEFER TO MY

05:06:26.901 --> 05:06:28.770
WITNESSES WATERSHED A LITTLE

05:06:28.837 --> 05:06:29.704
MORE COLOR WHITE ON THAT.

05:06:29.771 --> 05:06:31.439
CHAIR UNFORTUNATELY WHEN --

05:06:31.506 --> 05:06:33.141
COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH WORK COUNTY

05:06:33.208 --> 05:06:34.409
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND SCHOOL

05:06:34.476 --> 05:06:36.678
DISTRICTS DO NOT AGREED.

05:06:36.745 --> 05:06:37.946
THEM BASICALLY THERE IS NO

05:06:38.012 --> 05:06:40.148
APPEALS PROCESS SO.

05:06:40.215 --> 05:06:41.683
IF THERE IS NOT AGREEMENT

05:06:41.750 --> 05:06:43.885
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T AGREE ON THE

05:06:43.952 --> 05:06:45.987
YOUR IN -- DIRECT OF FEES YOU'RE

05:06:46.054 --> 05:06:47.856
GONNA CHARGE OR WHETHER -- THE

05:06:47.922 --> 05:06:50.058
STAFFING IS GOING TO BE OR ALL

05:06:50.125 --> 05:06:52.494
OF THOSE AREAS THAT YOU LOOK AT

05:06:52.560 --> 05:06:53.962
AN ANIMAL YOU.

05:06:54.028 --> 05:06:55.930
THEN THERE IS NO APPEALS SO

05:06:55.997 --> 05:06:58.767
BASICALLY THE TWO AGENCIES WALK

05:06:58.833 --> 05:07:00.935
AWAY AND UNFORTUNATELY THE KIDS

05:07:01.002 --> 05:07:03.238
IN THE MIDDLE ARE WHAT'S HURT.

05:07:03.304 --> 05:07:04.606
I AGREE WITH I THOUGHT I WE

05:07:04.672 --> 05:07:05.673
WOULD LOVE TO HAVE BETTER

05:07:05.740 --> 05:07:07.675
PARTNERSHIPS BUT WE HAVE HEARD

05:07:07.742 --> 05:07:09.711
OF UNFORTUNATELY VERY HIGH

05:07:09.778 --> 05:07:11.379
INDIRECT COSTS BEING CHARGED BY

05:07:11.446 --> 05:07:13.948
SOME COUNTIES OR PROPOSED TO BE

05:07:14.015 --> 05:07:15.416
CHARGED BY SOME COUNTIES.

05:07:15.483 --> 05:07:16.718
WE'VE HEARD OF ALSO THE

05:07:16.785 --> 05:07:18.186
REQUIREMENT THAT.

05:07:18.253 --> 05:07:19.888
VENDOR CERTAIN VENDORS BE USED

05:07:19.954 --> 05:07:21.556
TO COME INTO THE SCHOOLS THAT

05:07:21.623 --> 05:07:22.657
ISN'T THAT MAY NOT BE

05:07:22.724 --> 05:07:24.592
APPROPRIATE IT MAY NOT BE COST

05:07:24.659 --> 05:07:26.194
EFFECTIVE FOR THE DISTRICT TO TO

05:07:26.261 --> 05:07:28.396
FOLLOW THROUGH WITH THAT -- SO

05:07:28.463 --> 05:07:28.897
FROM A SCHOOL DISTRICT

05:07:28.963 --> 05:07:30.965
PERSPECTIVE WE HAVE TO LOOK AT

05:07:31.032 --> 05:07:32.534
THE LIMITED RESOURCES THAT WE

05:07:32.600 --> 05:07:35.470
HAVE AND HOW WE CAN USE THOSE

05:07:35.537 --> 05:07:37.272
BEST TO SERVE THOSE STUDENTS.

05:07:37.338 --> 05:07:38.606
I'M WORDY USING PROP NINETY

05:07:38.673 --> 05:07:39.674
EIGHT DOLLARS TO SERVE THOSE

05:07:39.741 --> 05:07:41.943
KIDS IN THIS AREA UNFORTUNATELY

05:07:42.010 --> 05:07:43.111
WE'RE NOT GETTING THAT EXTRA

05:07:43.178 --> 05:07:45.146
LITTLE MATCH TO GO WITH THE MEDI

05:07:45.213 --> 05:07:46.214
CAL.

05:07:46.281 --> 05:07:47.482
AND THE REASON WHY YOU PST TEA

05:07:47.549 --> 05:07:49.951
IS SO CRITICAL FOR SCHOOLS IS

05:07:50.018 --> 05:07:51.219
BECAUSE THEY'RE ABLE TO BILL FOR

05:07:51.286 --> 05:07:53.788
CERTAIN SERVICES RESIDENTIAL

05:07:53.855 --> 05:07:56.724
TREATMENT DAY -- SERVICES

05:07:56.791 --> 05:07:58.593
ADVANCED COUNSELING SERVICES AND

05:07:58.660 --> 05:08:00.061
OTHERS THAT ARE NOT ALLOWED

05:08:00.128 --> 05:08:02.197
UNDER THE ONLY A BILLING PROCESS

05:08:02.263 --> 05:08:04.132
THAT SCHOOLS CURRENTLY USE SO

05:08:04.199 --> 05:08:10.171
BASICALLY WHEN YOU HAVE THOSE

05:08:10.238 --> 05:08:12.173
HIGH COST PROGRAMS THAT I JUST

05:08:12.240 --> 05:08:12.740
LISTED.

05:08:12.807 --> 05:08:13.341
THOSE HIGH DOLLARS WHICH COULD

05:08:13.408 --> 05:08:14.242
BE UP TO A HUNDRED THOUSAND

05:08:14.309 --> 05:08:14.776
DOLLARS FOR A RESIDENTIAL

05:08:14.843 --> 05:08:15.443
TREATMENT ARE COMING OUT OF YOUR

05:08:15.510 --> 05:08:16.177
GENERAL FUND DOLLARS FOR THE

05:08:16.244 --> 05:08:16.578
SCHOOL DISTRICT.

05:08:16.644 --> 05:08:18.580
SO UNFORTUNATELY I AGREE THAT

05:08:18.646 --> 05:08:19.914
THE TWO AGENCIES AREN'T WORKING

05:08:19.981 --> 05:08:21.816
IT OUT THERE ARE A HANDFUL OF

05:08:21.883 --> 05:08:24.018
AGENCIES THAT DO HAVE AMMO USE

05:08:24.085 --> 05:08:25.553
AND THEY SEEM TO BE GOING WELL

05:08:25.620 --> 05:08:27.322
BUT THERE IS NO RECOURSE FOR

05:08:27.388 --> 05:08:30.024
SCHOOL DISTRICT TO GO FORWARD.

05:08:30.091 --> 05:08:32.994
AND GET ADDITIONAL DOLLARS IF

05:08:33.061 --> 05:08:34.896
THEY CAN AGREE WITH OUR COUNTY.

05:08:34.963 --> 05:08:36.998
SO I I GUESS I GUESS MY YOU

05:08:37.065 --> 05:08:39.200
KINDA ILLUSTRATED MY POINT A

05:08:39.267 --> 05:08:41.569
LITTLE BIT -- WHY ISN'T THE BILL

05:08:41.636 --> 05:08:43.771
FOCUSED ON THE AN APPEALS

05:08:43.838 --> 05:08:45.039
PROCESS WHY ISN'T THAT BECAUSE

05:08:45.106 --> 05:08:46.574
SETTING UP A SEPARATE BILLING

05:08:46.641 --> 05:08:49.277
SYSTEM TRUST ME BE CAREFUL WHAT

05:08:49.344 --> 05:08:50.545
YOU WISH?

05:08:50.612 --> 05:08:52.180
FOR IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT.

05:08:52.247 --> 05:08:53.514
AND YOU MIGHT FIND THAT IT'S

05:08:53.581 --> 05:08:55.083
ACTUALLY WORSE THAN WHAT YOU'RE

05:08:55.149 --> 05:08:56.084
DEALING WITH NOW BECAUSE YOU

05:08:56.150 --> 05:08:57.018
WANT TO SPEND MONEY ON

05:08:57.085 --> 05:08:58.519
ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS TO TRY TO

05:08:58.586 --> 05:08:59.687
BILL MEDICARE ON THESE

05:08:59.754 --> 05:09:01.589
COMPLICATED CASES.

05:09:01.656 --> 05:09:02.657
WE'VE HAD HEARINGS ON MENTAL

05:09:02.724 --> 05:09:04.225
HEALTH -- THROUGH THIS COMMITTEE

05:09:04.292 --> 05:09:05.727
AND FROM THIS COMMITTEE AND

05:09:05.793 --> 05:09:07.962
QUITE FRANKLY -- IT'S DIFFICULT

05:09:08.029 --> 05:09:09.130
ME WE'RE TRYING TO REDUCE

05:09:09.197 --> 05:09:10.665
PAPERWORK AND TRY TO FIND WAYS

05:09:10.732 --> 05:09:12.400
TO MAKE TO EXPEDITE SERVICES WE

05:09:12.467 --> 05:09:13.635
HAD A BILL ABOUT THAT EARLIER

05:09:13.701 --> 05:09:14.702
TODAY.

05:09:14.769 --> 05:09:16.170
I DO I JUST THINK I THINK THE

05:09:16.237 --> 05:09:17.639
BILLS AIMED AT THE WRONG PLACE

05:09:17.705 --> 05:09:18.907
QUITE FRANKLY TO SET UP A

05:09:18.973 --> 05:09:21.142
SEPARATE BILLING SYSTEM -- TO DO

05:09:21.209 --> 05:09:23.177
THIS DOESN'T MAKE SENSE WHEN THE

05:09:23.244 --> 05:09:25.179
PROBLEM APPEARS THAT THE THE THE

05:09:25.246 --> 05:09:27.015
THE THE TO PETE THE TWO PARTIES

05:09:27.081 --> 05:09:28.449
DON'T WANT TO DO THIS SO WHY

05:09:28.516 --> 05:09:29.784
ISN'T THIS BILL FOCUSED.

05:09:29.851 --> 05:09:32.620
ON A PROCESS AN APPEALS PROCESS

05:09:32.687 --> 05:09:34.722
SO THAT THE TWO PARTIES CAN WORK

05:09:34.789 --> 05:09:36.524
TOGETHER TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM.

05:09:36.591 --> 05:09:38.293
HELP ME UNDERSTAND WHY WHY IS

05:09:38.359 --> 05:09:42.030
THE FOCUS JUST SEEMS WRONG AND

05:09:42.096 --> 05:09:42.664
SO THAT'S WHY CAN'T SUPPORT THE

05:09:42.730 --> 05:09:43.331
BILL.

05:09:43.398 --> 05:09:45.133
DO YOU HAVE AN ANSWER FOR THAT.

05:09:45.199 --> 05:09:46.034
I'M.

05:09:46.100 --> 05:09:47.535
WE HAVE A TRIED IN IN PRIOR

05:09:47.602 --> 05:09:50.038
VERSIONS OF THE BILL THERE WAS A

05:09:50.104 --> 05:09:51.506
SUGGESTION OF APPEALS PROCESS

05:09:51.572 --> 05:09:53.675
UNFORTUNATELY THAT DIDN'T GO

05:09:53.741 --> 05:09:56.644
FORWARD EITHER.

05:09:56.711 --> 05:09:59.080
SO I YOU KNOW I I I I AGREE WITH

05:09:59.147 --> 05:10:00.748
YOU AND I AGREE THAT THE BILLING

05:10:00.815 --> 05:10:02.984
PROCESS IS A DIFFICULT THING IT

05:10:03.051 --> 05:10:04.585
IT DIFFICULT IS IT WOULD BE AN

05:10:04.652 --> 05:10:05.954

05:10:29.010 --> 05:10:30.044
IS ACTUALLY COOPERATION.

05:10:30.111 --> 05:10:30.678
BETTER CORPORATION AND LIKE THE

05:10:30.745 --> 05:10:31.879
BIKE I SAID THE BILL PROBABLY

05:10:31.946 --> 05:10:33.614
SHOULD BE MANDATING AN APPEALS

05:10:33.681 --> 05:10:35.550

WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC

NINETY TWO DAYS AND THAT'S THE

05:25:00.080 --> 05:25:02.583
AVERAGE -- IT'S UNSPEAKABLE THAT

05:25:02.649 --> 05:25:04.718
THAT ARE OWNERS THAT WANT TO

05:25:04.785 --> 05:25:05.419
TAKE OVER FACILITY THAT ACTUALLY

05:25:05.485 --> 05:25:07.921
ARE GOOD GOOD OWNERS AND WANT TO

05:25:07.988 --> 05:25:09.790
DO THAT -- AREN'T ABLE TO DO

05:25:16.029 --> 05:25:16.396
REALLY.

05:25:16.463 --> 05:25:17.598
THE LARGEST PROBLEM THAT WE'RE

05:25:17.664 --> 05:25:18.999

WORK WITH THEM.

05:25:24.872 --> 05:25:26.773
AND TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE SOLVE

05:25:26.840 --> 05:25:28.809
THIS BROKEN PROCESS WHEN WE HAVE

05:25:28.876 --> 05:25:31.178
OWNERS THAT ARE WAITING -- UP TO

05:25:31.245 --> 05:25:33.380
FOUR YEARS I MEAN THE FOLKS JUST

05:25:33.447 --> 05:25:34.314
TESTIFIED TO THE FACT THAT WE

05:25:34.381 --> 05:25:36.283

05:25:36.350 --> 05:25:37.150
WAITING THREE YEARS IF IT'S A

05:25:37.217 --> 05:25:39.786
KNOW IT NEEDS TO BE A NO QUICKLY --

05:25:39.853 --> 05:25:41.488
SO THE CURRENT OWNERS CAN FIND

05:25:41.555 --> 05:25:42.890
ANOTHER PERSON TO TAKE OVER THAT

05:25:42.956 --> 05:25:44.858
FACILITY -- WE THINK THAT THE

05:25:44.925 --> 05:25:46.693

05:25:52.766 --> 05:25:54.568
HAVE AN AGING POPULATION WE HAVE

05:25:54.635 --> 05:25:56.303
A LONG TERM CARE SYSTEM THAT'S

05:25:56.370 --> 05:25:58.805
THAT'S FRAGILE THAT NEEDS -- THE

05:25:58.872 --> 05:26:01.375
ABILITY TO CHANGE OWNERS A

05:26:01.441 --> 05:26:02.809
QUICKLY IF THERE'S A STRUGGLING

OVER THOSE FACILITIES.

05:26:08.248 --> 05:26:10.217
AND SO I THINK WE NEED TO ALL

05:26:10.284 --> 05:26:11.752
WORK COLLABORATIVELY TO FIND A A

05:26:11.818 --> 05:26:15.155
