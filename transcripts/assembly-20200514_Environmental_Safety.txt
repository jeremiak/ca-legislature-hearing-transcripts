OKAY WE HAVE NO PRIMARY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION PHONE MODERATOR DO YOU HAVE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION OF AB TWENTY TWO NINETY SIX. WITNESSES FROM OPPOSITION YOU MAY PRESS ONE THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME YOUR UP ONE MOMENT PLEASE. THANK YOU LINE THIRTEEN YOUR LINE IS OPEN. RIGHT YEAH MY APOLOGIES MY NAME IS MARYANN WARMER DAM I'M WITH RC RC GOOD AFTERNOON KEREN MEMBERS JUST WANT TO REITERATE SOME OF WHAT MR MY MINE HAD ARTICULATED THAT MANY OF OUR MEMBER COUNTIES ARE SMALL INSERT ECONOMICALLY DISTRESSED POPULATIONS. TWENTY TWO. CABLE REMEMBER COUNTIES TO OVERSEE THEIR WATER SYSTEM THROUGH LTA DON'T DELEGATION AGREEMENT. AS REQUIRED BY BOTH STATE AND FEDERAL LAW WITH A MORE EFFICIENT USE OF LIMITED RESOURCES. AB TWENTY TWO NINETY SIX DOES PROVIDE AN OPT IN OPTIONAL ALTERNATIVE FUNDING MECHANISM WHICH ALLOWS COUNTIES TO MAKE THE DECISION THAT BEST REFLECTS THE COMMUNITIES NEEDS WHILE MAINTAINING CAPACITY TO ADDRESS THE PORTFOLIO CONTINUITIES IN THIS AREA. FOR THESE REASONS WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY TWO NINETY SIX THANK YOU. THANK YOU. NO ONE ELSE PICK YOU UP AT THIS TIME. OKAY SO WE HAVE- WILL TURN TO. THE COMMITTEE IF THE COMMITTEE HAS ANY QUESTIONS. YES SIR OBERNOLTE I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR SO A CEMEX CONCERNS THAT I HAVE ABOUT THIS BILL IS THAT IF A LOCAL PRIMACY AGENCY. DELEGATES IT'S VIA FORTY TO THE STATE WATER BOARD I WITH THAT RESULT POTENTIALLY HIGHER FEES IN SOME AREAS BECAUSE THE WHOLE REASON FOR DAHLE JUSTIFICATION FOR THE BILL IS THAT NOT A FUNDING IS AVAILABLE SO MY QUESTION IS. IF WE'RE GOING TO STEER MORE FUNDING TO THESE RURAL COUNTY IS. THAT COMING FROM. DR DO YOU AN ANSWER. LET'S HEAR FROM OUR WITNESSES MISTER MALONE. YES THEY ARE. DOCTOR QUIRK ARE ASSEMBLY MEMBER OF IN ALL I CAN ADDRESS THAT YOU HEAR. WITH HER PLEASE PROCEED OKAY THANK YOU THE INTENT OF THE BILL IS AS I THINK YOU'VE CORRECTLY ASSESS. TO PROVIDE AN OPTIONAL FUNDING MECHANISM FOR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS. BECAUSE THE STRUCTURE OF THE STATE. ALLOWS FOR LOCALS TO CHARGE FIFTY THAT THEY DEEM. APPROPRIATE TO ADEQUATE THE AMOUNT OF AT LEAST THE AMOUNT IN EACH JURISDICTION IS VERY IS QUITE CONSIDERABLY AS A RESULT AND BECAUSE SOME OF THESE JURISDICTIONS HAVE A VERY VERY SMALL FEE BASED ON THE WITH A SMALL NUMBER OF. THE SYSTEM SOME OF THESE JURISDICTIONS ARE. TO CHARGE A REASONABLE ENOUGH FEED TO COVER THEIR COSTS THE FEDERAL AND STATE REQUIREMENTS. UNDER THS BILL. LOCAL JURISDICTIONAL ELECT. TO ARE THE CHARGE THEIR OWN FEE AS THEY DO NOW. ALL THEY WILL IF THE STATE ARCH THE FEET. A SINGLE STATEWIDE THAT THE- CHARGES ACROSS THE BOARD. AND THEY WILL. BASICALLY BE PAID BY THE STATE TO DO THE WORK THAT THEY HAVE TO DO. SO IT'S A WIN WIN FOR THE LOCAL. BECAUSE THEY HAVE AN OPTION OF EITHER HAVING THE STATE. IMPOSE THE STATE WIDE B. AND HAVE THE LOCALS PAID BY THE STATE PUT DOING THE WORK FOR. THAT DAY CAN KEEP THE STATUS QUO AND IT'S A WIN FOR THE STATE BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE TO GEAR UP AND TAKE OVER THOSE LOCAL PROGRAMS THAT ARE NOT ABLE TO PROVIDE THIS SERVICE WITH THE FEES THAT THEY ARE CURRENTLY CHARGING. SO WE SEE IS A WIN WIN AS AN OPTIONAL PROGRAM. IT ENHANCES AND RETAINS LOCAL CONTROL. BUT IT ALSO KEEPS THE- DELEGATION PROCESS FROM THE STATE WHICH IS SHOWS THAT A LOCAL JURISDICTION THAT WISHES TO BE AN LP A- STILL NEEDS THE NECESSARY REQUIREMENTS. THAT IS THAT ARE CAPABLE OF PERFORMING WHAT IT NEEDS TO PERFORM. RIGHT I LET ME LET ME ASK THE SAME QUESTION A DIFFERENT WAY I UNDERSTAND WHAT THE PURPOSE OF THE BILL IS AND THE MECHANICS- THAT ARE GOING INTO IT BUT MY QUESTION IS IF WE ARE TRYING TO STEER. MORE FUNDING TO. LOCAL PRIMACY AGENCY WHERE DOES THAT MONEY COME FROM. MONEY WILL COME FROM THE BOARD OF POTS OF MONEY THAT THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD HAS. AND THE THAT'S WHY INITIALLY THE WATER AGENCIES WERE CONCERNED. BECAUSE THE BILL WOULD COME FROM THE DRINKING WATERACCOUNT AT THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD. CURRENTLY MANAGES AND ADMINISTERS. AT ANY ADDITIONAL COST WOULD HAVE TO COME FROM THAT FOLDER ACCOUNT. AND MY EARLY- WHAT'S THAT THIS BILL IN OF ITSELF ISN'T. CAUSING AN INCREASE IN ANY OF THE FEES OR ANY OF THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT HAS TO BE PAID TO GET THIS JOB DONE BECAUSE THE LOCALS. CAN ACTUALLY DO THE WORK LESS THAN THE STATE. SO IF THE STATE WERE TO TAKE OVER THOSE CITY EL PA PROGRAMS. THEY WILL HAVE TO CHARGE THE SAME OR LACKEY MORE MONEY. FOR THE STATE TO DO THE WORK THAT THE LOCALS ARE DOING. SO THAT'S THE REASON THE LOCAL THE WATER AGENCIES ARE NOT NEUTRAL ON THE BILL. AT THE STATE THE BENEFIT. NXT SAID SHE'S. BUT BUT AT LEAST GETTING THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS THE CAPACITY TO CONTINUE THAT PROGRAM. OKAY I UNDERSTAND THANK YOU FOR THE RESPONSE- I STILL HAVE A CONCERN HERE THAT- BECAUSE THERE ISN'T ENOUGH MONEY COMING OUT IN FEES TO FUND. A CERTAIN LOCAL PRIVACY AGENCY THAT PRIVACY AGENT AGENCY WOULD DELEGATE ITS AUTHORITY TO THE STATE WATER BOARD GAME WE DECKED AXIS THEREBY TO A BROADER POOL OF FUNDS BUT I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHERE THOSE FUNDS ARE COMING FROM AND MY FEAR IS THAT- THE STATE WATER BOARD LED TO INCREASE FEES ON OTHER PARTS. STATE WOULD LEAD LEAD TO FIVE TWO USERS PAYING INTO A FUND THAT DIDN'T GET A DIRECT BENEFIT FROM SO THAT'S MY CONCERN I'M I'M OKAY ACOSTA- I'D LIKE TO SUPPORT THE BILL I'M GONNA STAY OFF IT FOR NOW JUST BECAUSE I'D LIKE TO GET AN ANSWER THAT QUESTION I'M SURE THE THIS BILL AGAIN OR SEE.

THE DTS HE OR ORIGINAL WATER BOARD HE IS FORCIBLY TAKING- OF TAKING CONTROL WHERE THE LOCAL HEALTH OFFICIALS.

OKAY SO I'M LOOKING AT A BILL THAT WAS AMENDED THE SIX SO THAT WAS A FEW DAYS AGO WAS THAT WAS AT THE CURRENT VERSION. YEAH OKAY BECAUSE THIS BILL SAYS. THE DEPARTMENT OR REGIONAL WATER CONTROL BOARD SHALL NOT ASSUME REGULATORY OVERSIGHT OVER A RELEASE AFTER REMEDIAL ACTION HAS BEEN OR ENTERED INTO UNLESS THE DEPARTMENT OR REGIONAL WATER QUALITY CONTROL BOARD MAKES ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING DETERMINATIONS ONE THREE MEDIAL SHIN BEING PROPOSED FOR THE SITE WILL BE INSUFFICIENT TO ADDRESS THE CONTAMINATION CAUSED BY THE RELEASED WAYS. SO MEANS TO ME THE WHAT THAT'S- WELL HEALTH OF OUR OFFICIAL HAD TO GO SHE ADDED. A MITIGATION AGREEMENT AND THE STATE DISAGREES WITH THE MEDICATION AGREEMENT THE STATE CAN TAKE OVER THAT MITIGATION WHICH I MEAN THAT SOUNDS VERY COURSE IT TO ME AND I. AM I MEAN I I'D LOVE TO SEE% THE FORM THAT THE BILL'S DELTA MEDLEY HAVE ALL I HAVE TO VOTE ON IS WHAT'S HERE IN PRINT AND WHAT'S HERE AND PRINT I THINK IT IS- IS SUFFICIENTLY CORROSIVE TOLD.

THROW THE NOTED DO YOU HAVE SOMETHING AGAINST DOCTOR COURT TODAY. I DON'T TO CITIES GO AHEAD BUT DOCTOR QUIRK LOVES HAVING ME ON THIS COMMITTEE BECAUSE I ALWAYS WAS SINCE I DON'T. SO I'M I'M OF SUPPORTER OF THIS BILL ARE ONE QUESTION I HAVE THOSE IS WHY OF THE THINGS THIS BILL DOES TO THE GRANT PROGRAM IS ADDS A NUMBER OF PROVISIONS. ARE FOR PENALTIES AND FINES FOR- FOR VIOLATIONS OF- OF THE PUBLIC TRUST WHICH I THINK A VERY APPROPRIATE- THERE IS A SECTION ON. REFUSAL TO FURNISH INFORMATION OR FURNISHING FALSE INFORMATION HERE. AND A PERSON CAN BE CHARGED- FIND UNDER THIS. SECTION FOR. ANY OF THE FOUR REASONS YOU'RE JUST A JUST HAVE TO ONE IF THE ALLEGED IS KNOWING WILLFUL INTENTIONAL IF YOU RECEIVE MATERIAL ECONOMIC BENEFIT FROM THE ACTION OR IF THE VIOLATION IS CHRONIC SO MY QUESTION IS I MEAN IT HAS TO BE ANY ONE OF THOSE THREE BUT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT. ANY ARE. A ANY ONE OF APPLYING FOR GRANT WOULD HAVE MATERIAL ECONOMIC BENEFIT BECAUSE IT'S A FINANCIAL GRANT SO I'M WONDERING WHAT THAT IS DOING IN THE SECTION BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO ME LIKE IT MAKES THE WHOLE THING MEANINGLESS- I WOULD SUGGEST THAT THAT. HE CHANGED TO WHAT IT IS IN OTHER PLACES IN THE BILL WHICH IS THAT NOW THAT'S ONE OF THE CONDITIONS THAT. THE BOARD WOULD CONSIDER IN SETTING THE AMOUNT OF THE FINE IS THE DEGREE TO WHICH THERE WAS MATERIAL ECONOMIC BENEFIT AND I JUST JUST AT HAT COMMENT. I WAS NOT REALLY QUESTION- BUT I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT THE BILL THAT JUST A SUGGESTION. FAIR ENOUGH. LET ME LET ME SAY I WILL LOOK INTO THAT JEFF THOROUGHLY. I'LL STILL HAVE A LITTLE BIT BETTER- INTRODUCED PREVIOUS QUESTION ON THE BALLOT TO ALREADY BEEN HEARD ON WHICH IS THAT THE STATE WOULD ONLY TAKE OVER IF THE- A LOCAL HEALTH OFFICERS DON'T HAVE THE APPROPRIATE RESOURCES-AND CANNOT EXERCISE ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY OVER THE RESPONSIBLE PARTY- SO. WELL I'M NOT DEAD AND I DO LOVE HAVING MISTER OBERNOLTE ON THIS COMMITTEE. THAT OUR QUESTION AND WE HAVE TO LOOK INTO THEM AND I GET REQUESTED TO BE ON IT AND I'M VERY GLAD TO HEAR. WE ALL ARE THANK YOU. I WE DO APPRECIATE THAT WE GIVE A ADDITIONAL DIFFERENCE PROVOCATIVE TO THE REALTOR THE COMMITTEE SO CAN HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE LATITUDE THAN MOST SO WE APPRECIATE THAT ADDITIONAL INSIGHT FROM THE PREVIOUS BILL- IS THERE A CLOSE THAT THE- AUTHOR- RIVERS OF.

WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE CHAIRMAN DOCTOR QUIRK WHO IS JOIN ME AS A JOINT AUTHOR ON THIS BILL LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FROM BOTH E. S. T. M. AS WELL AS THE HEALTH COMMITTEE FOR- SPENDING MANY HOURS ON THIS BILL I WANT TO GIVE SPECIAL THANKS TO PAGE BROKAW WITH THE S. HIM COMMITTEE WHO HAS WORKED ESPECIALLY HARD ON THIS BILL. THANKS TO ALL OF THE HOURS SPENT TOO MANY HOURS SPENT BETWEEN- COMMITTEE STAFF MY STAFF OF THE SPONSORS AND THE OPPOSITION OF THIS BILL- WORKING TOGETHER AFTER TWO YEARS OF WORK THEY COMMITTEE IS PROPOSING AMENDMENTS TODAY WHICH I WILL ACCEPT IN THEIR ENTIRETY. IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT WITH THESE AMENDMENTS ALL OPPOSITION WILL BE REMOVED AND IN I RECEIVED AN EMAIL INDICATE THAT THE PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS COUNCIL WITH EXCEPT THE AMENDMENTS WILL NOW MOVE TO A SUPPORT HAS BEEN FOR THE BELL BUT- LET. AS S. O. WILL BE TWENTY US THE VIRTUALLY WHAT WE SPEAK FOR HERSELF THIS BILL WILL BE COSMETICS AND CAL THAT CA TWELVE TOXIC CHEMICALS KNOWN AND ESTABLISHED BY SCIENCE TO CAUSE CANCER REPRODUCTIVE HARM OR HORMONE DISRUPTION. IN OVERALL HAVING THE EFFECT OF SUPPRESSING OUR IMMUNE SYSTEM WHICH MAKES THIS BILL NECESSRY DURING THIS COVER NINETEEN PANDEMIC THE SCIENCE IS CLEAR ON THE HARMFUL NATURE OF THESE CHEMICALS THESE CHEMICALS ARE ALREADY BANNED IN THE EUROPEAN UNION THE INTENT OF THIS BILL IS THAT THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS SHOULD HAVE THE SAME RIGHT THE SAME PROTECTIONS. SAME TOPIC FREE COSMETICS THAT ARE BEING SOLD IN EUROPE AND OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD WITH SIMILAR CONSUMER PROTECTIONS I HAVE TO I WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL DOCTOR TOP T&lt;c.cyan&gt; WELL IN&lt;/c&gt; EPIDEMIOLOGIST AND CO DIRECTOR OF THE UC DAVIS ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SCIENCE CENTER- COMMUTING GATES SPENT PROGRAM AND ALSO SUSAN LITTLE- WHAT THE ENVIRONMENTAL WORKING GROUP ONE OF THE SPONSORS OF THIS BACK. DOCTOR WHAT TYRONE YOU MAY PERCEIVE WITH YOUR TESTIMONY. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE MEMBERS- I AS- AS THE REPRESENTATIVE SAID THE FIND A DISPUTED ACTIVE HARM TO HUMAN HEALTH CAUSED BY THE TWELVE CHEMICALS THAT WOULD BE BANNED. BY THIS BILL AND PAN OF THE CHEMICALS ARE DIRECTLY LINKED TO BREAST CANCER AND NINE ARE LINKED TO A COMPROMISED IMMUNE SYSTEM. WHICH OF COURSE CAN- I'LL BE FINISHED ABOUT BUILDING. AND THE RECOVERY FROM COLBERT NINETEEN ALL OF THESE BILLS ARE CURRENTLY BANNED FROM COSMETIC PRODUCTS SOLD IN THE EUROPEAN UNION. SHALL DESPITE CLAIMS THAT A LITTLE BIT OF A TOXIC CHEMICAL IN A CONSUMER PRODUCT ID ACOSTA CONCERN THE EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT EVEN SMALL EXPOSURES CAN CAUSE HARM. HOPING FETUSES INFANTS AND CHILDREN. AND NONE OF US LIVE IN A BUBBLE WE ARE EXPOSED TO TOXIC CHEMICALS DALY AND HUMAN LOVE THE CUMULATIVE EXPOSURES INCREASE THE RISK OF HARM. SO EVIDENCE IS EMERGING THAT PEOPLE MOST AFFECTED BY TOXIC CHEMICAL EXPOSURES ARE MORE VULNERABLE TO CALL THE NINETEEN IN PERFECT ABILITY AND IN RECOVERY IMPORTANTLY NINE OF THE TWELVE CHEMICALS BANNED BY THE CELLS ARE LINKED TO DISRUPTION IN IMMUNE SYSTEM FUNCTION. WHICH CAN RESULT IN INFORMATION AND THE BACK CHRONIC INFLAMMATION IMPEDE PROPER FUNCTIONING OF THE IMMUNE SYSTEM. SO I JUST WANT TO SAY A LITTLE BIT OF WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT SOMEBODY'S TOXIC CHEMICALS- DEBTOR THAT THIS BILL WOULD BAN- STUDY SUBJECT THE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE P. FIVE EXPOSURE SUPPRESSED IMMUNE FUNCTION NORBIT DEVELOPMENTAL DELAYS AND GREATER RISK OF AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES. FORMALDEHYDE IS ANOTHER ONE AND A KNOWN CARCINOGEN MERCURY IS BLANK THE DEVELOPMENT OF REPRODUCTIVE HARM BOTH OF THOSE LAST TWO NEGATIVE NEGATIVELY IMPACT IMMUNE SYSTEM. SO THERE ON THE TRUCK HAMMOCK WHICH- DEVELOPING BRAIN. AND ALTERED LEVELS OF FRIDAY KIND WHICH ARE KEY PLAYERS IN IMMUNE RESPONSE TO CORONAVIRUS WHICH- HERE AGAIN. AMONG OTHER HEALTH IMPACT IMPACT THEIR NEW SYSTEM DEFENSE THIS AGAIN DEFECTION BY COLBERT NINETEEN. AND WHO IS AFFECTED MOST CHILDREN WOMEN OF CHILDBEARING AGE AND WOMEN OF COLOR WOMEN OF COLOR OVERLY EXPOSED TO TOXIC CHEMICALS IN THE COCKPIT PRODUCTS MARKETED TO THEM IN FACT- A RECENT AND I EIGHT STUDY. NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SCIENCES SHOW THAT BLACK WOMEN WHO FREQUENTLY DYE THEIR HAIR FACE OF 60% INCREASED RISK OF BREAST CANCER APPALLING BECAUSE WE AS A BLACK WOMAN MYSELF ALREADY FACE THE HIGHEST MORTALITY RATE FROM BREAST CANCER. ENDING YOUR U. S. RACIAL ETHNIC GROUP. SO KNOW IN A WOMEN WILL EXPERIENCE BREAST CANCER IN THEIR LIFETIME AND THIS IMPORTANT BILL TAKES US ONE STEP CLOSER TO PREVENTING BREAST CANCER. BY REMOVING A MAJOR SOURCE OF ONGOING EXPOSURE TO SOME OF THE MOST TOXIC CHEMICALS ON THE PLANET. I'M FINANCES AS A WOMAN OF COLOR AND THE MOTHER OF THREE DAUGHTERS. WE FACING THE STATISTICAL PROBABILITY THAT OUR RISK OF BREAST CANCER COULD BE INCREASED SIMPLY BECAUSE OF OUR PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS. I'M HERE TODAY TO TELL YOU THAT SIMPLY NOT OKAY. SPECIALLY SINCE THEY FOR ALTERNATIVE TO THESE CHEMICALS EXIST. AND THE COMPANIES SELLING THESE PRODUCTS HERE IN THE U. S. THEY'RE SELLING THE SAME PRODUCT WITHOUT THE TOXIC CHEMICALS IN EUROPE EXCUSE ME DOCTOR THOUGH THANKS SO MUCH. OKAY THANK YOU SO MUCH NOW. RIGHT APPRECIATE ABLE TO.

TO GET US HERE. WHEN OUR ORGANIZATIONS COMPARED THE NOMINAL COSMETICS REGULATION IN THE UNITED STATES THE ROBUST SAFETY REQUIREMENTS FOR COSMETICS. SOLD IN THE EUROPEAN UNION. WE WERE SURPRISED BY THE DISPARITY. THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION ONLY BANDS OR RESTRICTS ELEVEN INGREDIENTS FROM HOUSTON US COSMETICS. AND HAS VERY LITTLE AUTHORITY TO PROTECT CONSUMERS OTHERWISE. THE E. YOU ON THE OTHER HAND PROHIBITS THE USE OF THIRTEEN HUNDRED INGREDIENTS. AND FURTHER RESTRICT SEVERAL HUNDRED MORE OVERALL MORE THAN FORTY NATIONS HAVE TAKEN STEPS TO BAN INGREDIENTS. OF CONCERN FROM THESE VERY THESE EVERYDAY PRODUCTS.

LEGISLATION THIS DEAL IF YOU WELL BECAUSE- OUR INDUSTRY DESPERATELY NEEDS SHOW SHORT AND LONG TERM REGULATORY CERTAINTY SB RECOVER FROM THE ECONOMIC IMPACTS OF COVERT NINETEEN. AS WAS ELOQUENTLY OUTLINED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. THIS WAS FOUNDATIONAL AND US TO DETERMINING THAT WE COULD SUPPORT THE SPELL. WE REALLY SEE THIS AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO SHIFT THE NARRATIVE- WITH RESPECT TO OUR INDUSTRY WE ARE NOT OPERATING IN THE WILD WILD WEST ACCORDING TO SOME. WE DON'T MAKE PRODUCTS AT HER COST CONSUMERS WE SUPPORT SCIENCE AND SENSIBILITY. OUR INDUSTRY MAKES PRODUCTS THAT HELP CONSUMERS ON THE ROAD TO HELL. WE COMPLY WITH REGULAR A STATE AND FEDERAL LAWS WITH RESPECT TO SAFETY. AND HONESTLY SPEAKING THE REAL PUBLIC HEALTH THE REST PUBLIC HEALTH RISK LIES WITH A LIST OF PRODUCTS MADE BY WAY OF THE BLACK MARKET AND THE LEGITIMATE INDUSTRY CAN NO LONGER TAKE THE BRUNT FOR THE LIST OF MARKET.
