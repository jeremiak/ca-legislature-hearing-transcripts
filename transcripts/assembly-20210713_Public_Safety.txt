ONLY ONE SOLVERS ZERO OR TO THE. ONE BILL OF OUR RESIDENTS WERE DOING WHAT WE ARE. SO FOR EXCLUDES. CALIFORNIA THIS BILL MAYNARD PROBLEM UNIQUE STUDENT OF MINE WE WERE VIA SCHAGEN ABOUT OUR. THREE THOUSAND EIGHTEEN- WRONG FOR. THE MORE THE. I OFTEN VIA THEN OFFICER IF THE CERTIFICATION EVENT PLACE YOUR ONE BECAUSE THIS OFFICER WAS INVOLVED IN THREE OTHER QUESTIONABLE SHOOTINGS IN ANOTHER PART REMEMBER. TO THE CITY OF GARDENA UNFORTUNATELY CAN THE FROST UP WAS NOT UNIQUE. BUT IT'S REFLECTIVE THE PROBLEMS THAT WE HAVE THROUGHOUT OUR STATE AND HAPPENED ACROSS THE COUNTRY ON A REGULAR BASIS. THESE ARE PROBLEMATIC OFFICERS THAT COMMITMENTS CONDUCT. AND ONE DEPARTMENT. AND ARE YOU ARE NOT HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR CONTINUE TO BE A PROBLEMFOR THAT COMMUNITY OR THEY ARE HELD ACCOUNTABLE BUT THEY'RE ABLE TO FIND EMPLOYMENT AT ANOTHER APARTMENT IN ANOTHER CITY. USUALLY THESE PROBLEM OFFICERS FIND THEMSELVES IN COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. AND THE POOR COMMUNITIES THEY'RE NEVER IN A FLUENT COMMUNITIES OR AT LEAST YOU DON'T SEE THIS TYPE OF BEHAVIOR AND THOSE COMMUNITIES. DURCH OFTEN IS AN EXAMPLE ONE OF THESE OFFICERS WHO. LONG BEFORE HE MURDERED GEORGE FLOYD. ADDED EXTENSIVE HISTORY OF COMPLAINTS OF MISCONDUCT FILED AGAINST HIM. THIS INCLUDED HOLDING A FOURTEEN YEAR OLD BLACK CHILD DOWN. WHAT IS NAY SOUNDS FAMILIAR. NOW FOR NINE MINUTES AND THIRTY NINE SECONDS FOR SEVENTEEN MINUTES IGNORING COMPLAINTS BY THAT TEENAGER THAT PRODUCTS THE- DATED THE PHRASE I CAN'T BREATHE I'M PRETTY SURE YOU HEARD THAT BEFORE. ALTHOUGH HE WASN'T ULTIMATELY HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THIS PRIOR MISCONDUCT MINNESOTA DOES HAVE A MECHANISM AVAILABLE. IN THE STATE TO DECERTIFY. OFFICERS UNFORTUNATELY THEY DIDN'T USE IT HERE. BUT CALIFORNIA DOES NOT WE'RE ONE OF ONLY FOUR STATES IN THE NATION THAT DOESN'T HAVE THE CERTIFICATION PROCESS. SB TWO WILL DO TWO THINGS. THE BILL MAKES CHANGES TO STRENGTHEN THE TOM BANKS SO WE'RE RIGHTS ACT IT CLARIFIES THAT THREE OF THE MOST EGREGIOUS IMMUNITIES CALMLY ASSERTED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT ARE NOT APPLICABLES TO CLAIMS BROUGHT UNDER THE BAN ACT. AND THAT'S FOLLOWING A FOST OF OUR FALSIFYING ARRESTS. GOING TO PROVIDE MEDICAL CARE ARE CAUSING INJURY TO A PRISONER SECOND THE BILL CREATES A STATEWIDE PROCESS TO REVOKE THE CERTIFICATION OF OFFICER AFTER THE CONVICTION OF SERIOUS CRIMES FOR TERMINATION FROM EMPLOYMENT DUE TO MISCONDUCT CALIFORNIA'S ABLE TO REVOKE THE CERTIFICATION AND THE LICENSE ABOUT DOCTORS LAWYERS TEACHERS NURSES. BARBERS COSMETOLOGISTS WE CAN EVEN RECALL ELECTED OFFICIALS BUT WERE UNABLE TO DECERTIFY POLICE OFFICERS WHO HAVE BROKEN THE LAW AND VIOLATED PUBLIC TRUST AND THIS IS WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT NOT ABOUT A RADICAL EATING POLICE ARE DE FUNDING THE POLICE IT'S ABOUT GETTING RID OF THOSE BAD APPLES THAT WE KNOW EXIST AN ALL OF SOCIETY. THIS BILL WOULD CREATE A FAIR AND EFFECTIVE PROCESS TO ENSURE THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS WHO BREAK THE PUBLIC TRUST ARE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR ACTIONS. AND NOT ALLOW THE SIMPLY MOVED TO ANOTHER DEPARTMENT AS I STATED THE WASHED RINSE AND REPEAT CYCLE THAT WE'VE SEEN THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA AND THROUGHOUT THIS NATION ADDITIONALLY THIS BILL ALLOWS THE COMMISSION ON PEACE OFFICER. STANDERTON TRAINING TO INVESTIGATE GROUNDS FOR OFFICERS MISCONDUCT LET ME SAY THIS AGAIN IT ALLOWS THE COMMISSION PEACE OFFICER STANDARDS AND TRAINING COMMISSION THAT IS PRIMARILY MADE UP LAW ENFORCEMENT. TO INVESTIGATE THE GROUNDS FOR OFFERS MISCONDUCT THIS IS STORIES IMPORTANT IN ENSURING THAT WE ARE CREATING AN EFFECTIVE. THE CERTIFICATION SYSTEM. WOULD ALSO BE CREATING ADVISORY BOARD WITH THE IMPULSE THAT WOULD MAKE INITIAL RECOMMENDATIONS ON WHETHER POLL SHOULD DECERTIFY AN OFFICER. AND FIND THIS BILL ALLOWS THE COMMISSION TO DEFINE BY REGULATIONS THE SPECIFIC GROUNDS OF SERIOUS MISCONDUCT THAT WOULD BE CONSIDERED FOR DECERTIFICATION. SEVERAL SEVERAL THESE EGREGIOUS GROUNDS ARE LAID OUT IN THE BILL SUCH AS SEXUAL ASSAULT. THIS HONESTY AND ABUSE OF POWER AMONG OTHERS ALSO MADE THE COMMISSION HAS AUTHORITY AND DEFINING WHAT EXACTLY MISCONDUCT- CAN LEAD TO WHAT EXACT MISCONDUCT CAN LEAD TO DO CERTIFICATION. WE FEEL THIS IS A FAIR APPROACH. IS NOTHING RADICAL ABOUT THIS MANY OTHER STATES AS I STATED ARE CURRENTLY DOING THIS. WE RECENTLY MADE AMENDMENTS AFTER CONVERSATIONS WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND MANY OF THE STAKEHOLDERS. AND MAJOR CHANGE FOLLOWING THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE WAS TO BE MOVED ABILITY TO FILE A WRONGFUL DEATH CLAIM UNDER THOMAS PAINE ACT WILL ALSO MADE SEVERAL CHANGES RELATED TO THE TORY. OF THE ADVISORY BOARD. REMOVE THE LICENSING FEE. AND LIMIT THE EXTENT. TO WHICH POLLS CONDUCTED OWN INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATIONS THESE CHANGES WERE NOT EASY FOR US TO MAKE. BUT I THINK WE LEFT THE BILL THAT IS FAIR AND STRONG AND WILL ACHIEVE THE GOALS THAT WE'RE ALL TRYING TO. ACHIEVE HERE. IT WILL BE A PROCESS THAT IS EFFECTIVE IN REDDING DEPARTMENTS OF BAD OFFICERS. BUT STE STILL WORKABLE FOR THE POST COMMISSION. AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS BILL WITH AN ADMINISTRATION WITH COMMITTEE STAFF AS WE HAVE WORKED WITH THIS COMMITTEE STAFF AND ALL OF OUR STAKEHOLDERS. THE TIME IS NOW TO CREATE A POLICE TO CERTIFICATION SYSTEM AND CALIFORNIA. IF NOT NOW THEN WHEN IT MUST BE STRONG IT MUST BE A SYSTEM THAT OUR COMMUNITIES CAN TRUST CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO BE THE LEADER WE LEAD AND ENVIRONMENT WE LEADING TECHNOLOGY WE LEAD AND A COPY OF THE ECONOMY. AND ALL THOSE THINGS THAT ARE IMPORTANT. BUT WE FILLED THE LEAD WHEN WE TALK ABOUT REAL POLICE REFORM HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE DAY I'M HAPPY TO HAVE TWO AMAZING INDIVIDUALS TESTIFYING ON OUR BEHALF. FOR USE THAT. I'M A ROUTE YOU CHOOSE THE MOTHER OF KENNETH ROSS JUNIOR. AND DYING GOLDSTINE EXACT DIRECTOR OF LAW ENFORCEMENT ACTION. PARTNERSHIP AND WILL ALSO HAVE PETER BY BRING- FROM THE ACLU HERE TO ASK ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS THAT MIGHT BE A ROCK- MIGHT COME UP. AND I WILL IN THEIR AND OUR WHICH BERKELEY US FOR YOUR AYE VOTE TO APPROPRIATE TIME. THANK YOU SENATOR BRADFORD WAS LISTEN TO MISS ALMA RUTH FIRST AND THEN- DI&lt;c.cyan&gt; GHOSTING FROM BLACK&lt;/c&gt; LIVES MATTER. YOU HAVE TWO AND A HALF MINUTES A PIECE OR WHATEVER WAY YOU WANT TO SPLIT IT UP. YES MY NAME IS MELINA ABSOLUTE ONBLACK LIVES MATTER AND I'M REPRESENTING MY SCHOOL VIA ARMBAR RULE WHO IS HAVING AN URGENT MATTER WITH HER OTHER CHILDREN THIS MORNING BUT SHE ASKED ME TO READ HER STATEMENT IN HER STEAD- SO HERE'S YOUR STATEMENT. ROCKY JUNIOR WITH MY FIRSTBORN. HE WAS MY ROCK IN THIS WORLD ON APRIL ELEVENTH TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN SERGEANT MICHAEL WRAPPING OF THE GARDENA POLICE DEPARTMENT. WHICH USED TO BE CAN I SET MY SON AS A LOVING FATHER TO HIS SON. AS THE OLDER SIBLING IS A TALENTED YOUNG BLACK MAN YOU HAVE A GREAT POTENTIAL AND EVERY POSSIBILITY IN THIS WORLD. MICHAEL ROBBINS PUT IT TARGET ON MY SON'S BACK HE HUNTED IM LIKE CRAZY. AND SHOT HIM IN COLD BLOOD. HE TOLD HER ME AND STOLE FROM MY FAMILY SOMETHING THAT IS IRREPLACEABLE. YOU CAN'T BEGIN TO IMAGINE THE PAIN THAT I. WRESTLE WITH EVERY SINGLE DAY. WHAT I LEARN THAT IT WHAT I'M- IS THAT IT IS TRULY A GAME FOR TARGET MICHAEL WRAPPING. WELL FOR SURE SHOOTING KENNETH ROBIN SHOT SHOT THREE OTHER PEOPLE AND SEPARATE INCIDENTS IN A PREVIOUS POLICE FOR. BUT HE WAS STILL HIRED BY GARDENA POLICE DEPARTMENT YOU NEVER SHOULD HAVE BEEN ON THE FORCE IN THE FIRST PLACE HE NEVER SHOULD HAVE HAD A BADGE AND A GUN. AFTER THE FIRST SHOOTING HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN BARRED FROM BEING AN OFFICER ANYWHERE. THIS IS WHAT SB TWO WILL GET. THE CANNOT BROUGHT YOUNGER POLICE DECERTIFICATION BILL NAMED IN HONOR OF MY- WILL PREVENT OTHER MOTHERS FROM HAVING TO LIVE WITH THE PAIN AND RAGE THAT IDEA. IT WILL REMOVE OFFICER TO ALREADY PROVEN TO BE DANGEROUS. WE MUST PASS THIS BILL AND THE NAME OF MY SON. KENNETH ROCK JUNIOR. AND WE ALSO OFFER A BLACK LIVES MATTER THAT DAY IS THAT EACH ANNIVERSARY OF BLACK LIVES MATTER IN THE APPROPRIATE DAY IS SO MANY OF YOU HAVE LISTED THE WORD INSTEAD THE WORD. BLACK LIVES MATTER THAT WE ACTUALLY HAVE TO BUILD COMMITTEE CAN MAKE BLACK LIVES MATTER NOT JUST SAY THE WORD SO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HEARING ON AND- WE OFFER PRAYER OR- YEAH I'M A REAL AND THE FAMILY OF CANNOCK. JUNIOR PROPONENTS STILL LISTENING THANK YOU SO MUCH TO THE AUTHOR HE BRADFORD FOR HONORING CANISTERS. IN THIS WAY. THANK YOU DR. BED DISTINGUISHED OF THE MY NAME STAND I'M A RICH LEE AND THE EXACT DIRECTOR OF THE LAW ENFORCEMENT ACTION PARTNERSHIP A GROUP OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE PROFESSIONALS WHO SPEAK FROM FIRST HAND EXPERIENCE. WE ARE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF SB TWO AS AMENDED WHICH WOULD INCREASE ACCOUNTABILITY FOR OFFICERS WHO COMMIT SERIOUS MISCONDUCT AND VIOLATE A PERSON CIVIL RIGHTS SPECIFICALLY THE BILL WOULD CREATE A MULTI LAYER SYSTEM OF DUE PROCESS TO REVOKE PROFESSIONAL LICENSING ISSUE TWO OFFICERS FOR MISCONDUCT. ASIAN WIDE FORTY SIX STATES ALREADY HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO DECERTIFY THEIR COPS IN TWO THOUSAND AND THREE. UNDER PRESSURE FROM POLICE LOBBYIST THE LEGISLATURE REMOVE POSTS THE FORTY TO DENY OR CANCEL AN OFFICER CERTIFICATION. THIS LEFT THE DISCIPLINE OF OFFICERS ACCUSED OF MISCONDUCT TO LOCAL AGENCIES ALLOWING THE POLICE TO POLICE THEMSELVES. FOLLOWING THE ENACTMENT OF SB FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE THERE'S BEEN NUMEROUS STORIES OF OFFICERS COMMITTEE MISCONDUCT. THESE OFFICERS REMAIN EMPLOYED AFTER PLEADING DOWN TO LESSER CRIME IF THEY'RE PROSECUTED AND CONVICTED AT ALL OTHER TIMES THESE OFFICERS RESIGN OR ARE FIRED ONLY TO GET RE HIRED AT ANOTHER AGENCY WHERE THE MISCONDUCT CONTINUES. THE INABILITY TO REMOVE THESE OFFICERS UNDERMINES POLICE LEGITIMACY AND COMPROMISES PUBLIC SAFETY. I SERVED IN BOTH THE SUPERVISORY CAPACITY AS WELL AS COMMANDING MULTIPLE DIVISIONS THE SHOW ME EXACTLY WHY COMMUNITIES FEEL UNSAFE WHEN LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS ARE NOT HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR VIOLATING OUR OATH TO PROTECT AND SERVE. SB TWO IS A SIMPLE AND OBVIOUS SOLUTION BY PROVIDING ROBUST LAW ENFORCEMENT REPRESENTATION IT ENSURES THE PROCESS FOLLOWS THE MODEL OF OTHER LICENSING BOARD IN THE STATE AND CREATES A THOROUGH SYSTEM OF REVIEW THAT PROTECTS BOTH THE COMMUNITY AND POLICE OFFICERS RIGHTS. IN A RECENT EDITORIAL WRITTEN BY THE PRESIDENTS OF THE LAPD PROTECTIVELY THE SAN JOSE IN THE SAN FRANCISCO POLICE OFFICERS ASSOCIATION. THEY STATED ENACT POLICE REFORM STOP STUDYING. AND FRUSTRATION WITH THE LACK OF FEDERAL LEADERSHIP THAT WOULD IMPROVE THE POLICING PROFESSION. I WAS I WOULD SUGGEST THAT THEIR WORDS MATTER IN THIS CONTEXT AS WELL WHEN IT COMES TO IMPROVING POLICING IT'S TIME TO ACTUALLY DO SOMETHING. SB TWO WILL NOT FIX EVERYTHING THAT MUST BE ADDRESSED IN POLICING BUT IT IS A NECESSARY STEP THAT WILL SHORT CONSTITUENTS WE ARE LISTENING TO THEIR CONCERNS AND THAT THEY ARE INTEGRAL IN DEFINING WHAT COMMUNITY SAFETY MEANS. WE URGE YOU TO PASS SB TWO THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. NOW WE'LL GO INTO THE ROOM- THERE ANYONE IN FORTY TWO OH TWO.

GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS THAT COULD HAPPEN AND I'M THE PRESIDENT OF THE AND I AM PLEASED SITUATION AND AN EXECUTIVE BOARD MEMBER OF THE STATE WIDE PEACE OFFICERS RESEARCH ASSOCIATION. OF CALIFORNIA- PORAC ESTABLISHING THE LICENSURE PROGRAM CALIFORNIA IS A PRIORITY FOR POOR ACT NO ONE WANTS TO SEE THAT OPPOSITION FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT MORE THAN GOOD OFFICERS DO. WHEN I ALSO ACT IN A WAY THAT IS GROSSLY INCONSISTENT WITH THE MISSION AND GOALS OF OUR PROFESSION GIVES ALL LAW ENFORCEMENT A BAD NAME. ONLY HARMS OUR ABILITY TO BUILD BACK THE COMMUNITY TRUST ME TO CARRY OUT OUR SERVICE SAFELY AND EFFECTIVELY. HAVING SAID THAT HOWEVER. YES TWO THAT'S CURRENTLY RIGHT IS NOW THE RIGHT OF. WILL CREATE BIAS AND I'M PRICE WILL YOU KNOW. LIE FIRST. SB TWO INCLUDES WEAPON. TO OVER BROAD GET THE OF RISK. BUT OF PARTY. AND OPEN FOR INTERPRETATION. SECOND SB TO. PROVIDE THE COMMISSION WITH THE AUTHORITY TO INVESTIGATE AN OFFICER WHILE IGNORING THE OFFICERS CONSTITUTIONAL PROTECTIONS. AFFORDED BY THE PEACE OFFICERS PROCEDURAL BILL OF RIGHTS. THIRD SB TWO ESTABLISHES AN INHERENTLY BIASED 9% OVERSIGHT PANEL. THAT INCLUDES SEVEN MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC CORE REQUIRED I REPEAT REQUIRED. TO HAVE A PREDETERMINED BIAS. AGAINST THE OFFICER. AND ONLY TO MEMBERS WHO. HAVE PRIOR LAW ENFORCEMENT EXPERIENCE. WE CANNOT ALLOW OFF TO DEMONSTRATE MISCONDUCT TO BE MEMBERS OF THE LAW ENFORCEMENT. THEIR LIVES MUST BE WITH. ON AS WRITTEN SB TWO WOULD OVERRIDE PROCESS AND IGNORE THE BASIC TEN IN THE THIRD SUPPORTED TO ALL CITIZENS. IN CONCLUSION WE HAVE BEEN AND WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE GOVERNOR NEWSOME'S OFFICE AND THE LEADERSHIP OF BOTH HOUSES TO IMPROVE SENATE BILL TWO. WE ARE COMMITTED TO COMPLETING OUR GOAL OF ESTABLISHING A FAIR AND EFFECTIVE PEACE OFFICER LICENSE PROGRAM. THIS YEAR. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU NOT JONATHON FELDMAN. IT SURE MEMBERS THE MORNING JOHNSON SULEMAN ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA POLICE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION I'D LIKE TO FIRST THANK LEADERSHIP BOTH HOUSES THE COMMITTEE AND THE CHAIRMAN AUTHORS OFFICE AND GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND THE VERY STAKEHOLDERS FOR THE DISCUSSION BEGAN ON THIS MEASURE LEADING TO THIS POINT. IT'S CLEAR FROM THESE CONVERSATIONS WITH EVERYONE TO SEE A DECERTIFICATION TESTAMENT OPTED INCLUDING EACH OF CALIFORNIA'S THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY TWO POLICE CHIEFS. THE CONCERNS WE HAVE RAISED AN EXECUTION NOT BE MISCONSTRUED AS ANYTHING MORE THAN ISSUES WE'VE IDENTIFIED WITH A SPECIFIC PROPOSAL NOT IN A VERSION OR OPPOSITION TO PERMANENTLY REMOVING OFFICERS. WERE FOUND GUILTY OF SERIOUS MISCONDUCT. WELL APPRECIATE THEM TAKE AHEAD OF THE HEARING- SEVERAL CRITICAL ISSUES REMAINING THAT WE BELIEVE NEED TO BE ADDRESSED INCLUDING. A FAIR AND JUDICIOUS PROCESS FOR INSTANCES WHERE POST ME TO SIDE TO DECERTIFY AN OFFICER WHO HAD BEEN EXONERATED. OR WHO HAS HAD A COMPLAINT NOT SUSTAIN TO AN INTERNAL AFFAIRS INVESTIGATION. IF POST IS GOING TO CHALLENGE A LOCAL AGENCY THE STANDARD SHOULD BE HIGH ON THE PROCESS SHOULD CONCLUDE WITH THE COURTS. WE ALSO BELIEVE PRO SHOULD BE PRESENTED ALL THE FACTS BE ALLOWED TO MAKE AN INDEPENDENT DETERMINATION EACH CASE. NOT FORCED TO ADOPT THE RECOMMENDATION OF THE CIVILIAN REVIEW BOARD IN AN INSTANT. I BELIEVE THE DEFINITION OF SERIOUS MISCONDUCT OUTLINED IN THE BILL NEEDS TO BE MORE FOCUSED WELL WE UNDERSTAND POST WILL DEVELOP THE FULL DEFINITION DEREGULATION SB TWO REQUIRES QUOTE. WITHOUT LIMITATION. MANY BROAD AND SUBJECTIVE CATEGORIES. AND FINALLY THE MAKE UP OF THE CIVILIAN REVIEW BOARD NEEDS BALLOTING WE UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE INCLUDING THE MAJORITY CIVILIAN BOARD IN TERMS OF CREATING INTEGRITY WITHIN THE SYSTEM. WOULD MAKE IT CURRENTLY NOT SPEAK TO INCLUDE THOSE WHO WOULD BE FOUND IMPARTIAL AND CORPORATE. CALIFORNIA POLICE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION IS COMMITTED TO FINDING AN AGREEMENT ON DECERTIFICATION THIS YEAR AND WILL REMAIN FOCUSED ON THAT GOAL. UNFORTUNATELY WE ARE NOT THERE YET AND THEREFORE MUCH SPORTS ARE CONCERNED YOU CAN ASK FOR NOTEBOOK TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU WE NOW MOVE TO THE TO THE ROOM AND FORTY TWO OH TWO.

YES MY NAME IS ACTUALLY AND THEN A COMMUNITY ACTIVIST FOR POLICE ACCOUNTABILITY. THIS IS YOUR THERE IS NO ONE ELSE WHOSE WISHES TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU WE NOW BRING IT TO TOO MANY FOR ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. MR LACKEY. YES FIRST OF ALL I WOULD LIKE TO- SAY THAT WE SURE DO- SHARE A COMMON INTEREST. AND TRYING TO- ESTABLISH A DECERTIFICATION PROBLEM PROCESS THAT- WILL REMOVE TOXIC OFFICERS WE HAVE SEEN. THAT THE TRUST BETRAYED OVER AND OVER AND WE NEED A PROCESS GIVEN THAT WILL- FAIRLY ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM. HOWEVER I DO BELIEVE AS- MANY WE JUST HEARD FROM- IN THE LAW ENFORCEMENT PROFESSION. THAT- IN THIS PARTICULAR BILL THERE ARE TOO MANY OVERBROAD DEFINITIONS- AND THEIR CIRCUMSTANCES IN THIS BILL. THE LESSON OBJECTIVE LET ME GIVE YOU ONE OF THE MOST GLARING EXAMPLES. AND THIS IS THAT THE COMPOSITION OF THE PEACE OFFICER STANDARDS ACCOUNTABILITY ADVISORY BOARD. LET ME JUST A JUST REAL QUICKLY FIND OUT WHY I BELIEVE THERE'S AN INEQUITY HERE. SIX OR SEVEN OF NINE MEMBERS WILL PROBABLY OR DEFINITELY BE BIASED AGAINST LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS. NOR THE REGULATORY AGENCY CALIFORNIA. NO OTHER STATES DO CERTIFICATION LAW REQUIRES SUCH A SIMILAR COMPOSITION THE INCLUSION OF TWO MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WHO SHALL NOT BE FORMER PEACE OFFICERS HAVE BEEN SUBJECT. TO RUN FOR USE OF FORCE TO CAUSE DEATH OR SERIOUS BODILY INJURY TO A PEACE OFFICER OR WHO ARE SURVIVING FAMILY MEMBERS. ARE PERSECUTED BY THE WRONGFUL USE OF DEADLY FORCE IS ESPECIALLY EGREGIOUS. WE DON'T REQUIRE VICTIMS OF MALPRACTICE. TO HAVE SUBSTANTIAL REPRESENTATION ON ANY KIND OF MEDICAL BOARD. THIS IS THIS IS CLEARLY. UNFAIR IN MY OPINION AND THIS ADVISORY BOARD HAS SIGNIFICANT POWER IN THIS PROCESS IT'S NOT JUST A SUGGESTIVE- PERSPECTIVE THEY HAVE BINDING INFLUENCE ON THIS DETERMINATION AND SUCH AN ADVISORY BOARD SHOULD HAVE THAT. BUT IT SHOULD BE AT LEAST SOMEWHAT OBJECTIVE AND I I'VE I FEEL THAT. THIS IS MORE FOCUSED ON AN ANTI LAW ENFORCEMENT SENTIMENT. AND NON OBJECTIVE AND THEREFORE I CAN'T SUPPORT IT. THANK YOU MR CLARK. FIRST I'LL MOVE THE BELL. NOT HAVING PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS IS THE SMARTEST THING YOU'VE GOT. EVERY BOARD EVERY BOARD SHOULD NOT HAVE A MAJORITY OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE A. JUST POSITION TO SUPPORT OTHER PEOPLE IN THE SAME PROFESSION THIS IS A FEATURE OF FEATURE THAT IS SO IMPORTANT THAT WE OUGHT TO DO IT ON EVERY SINGLE BEFORE WE OUGHT TO HAVE ON THE MEDICAL BOARD PEOPLE WHO HAVE HAD. MEDICAL MALPRACTICE CLAIMS AND HUSSEIN HOW AWFUL THINGS CAN BE WHEN EVERYONE TRIES TO PROTECT THE DOCTOR. THE SAME THING HERE. AND I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW IMPORTANT THAT IS I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS IN THIS. NOW I DO SUGGEST SO IN THE COMMENTS SECTION FOUR FIVE SIX SEVEN EIGHT NINE. THERE ARE SUGGESTIONS ABOUT- ESSENTIALLY REFINING YOUR BILL FOR EXAMPLE CONFLICTS WITH CURRENT TEMPERATURES CENTER PROBAR DO YOU MEAN TO- YOU KNOW CHANGE THE LAW IN THAT AREA OR NOT- THURMOND WHICH YOU COULD TAKE- I KNOW THE COMMITTEE IS WORK WITH YOU- I'D SUGGEST THAT YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THAT SCALI HEARINGS. THERE'S A PROCEDURE WHERE AFTER THE FIRST GOLLY HEARING- YOU CAN APPEAL THE DETERMINATION TO SUPERIOR COURT. THEN AFTER YOU GO THROUGH THE POPE ARE PROCESS YOU CAN APPEAL AGAINST THE SUPERIOR COURT. IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE THAT THERE WOULD BE DIFFERENCES HERE SO THESE ARE SOME OF THE THINGS POINTED OUT THE ANALYSIS AND I THINK THAT THESE COULD BE- SIMPLY- TO FIND BETTER- JUST THOUGHT THROUGH A LITTLE BIT MORE YOU CAN DATE DRESS THESE IN YOUR CLOTHES IF YOU LIKE BUT OF COURSE I'LL BE SUPPORTING IT I CONSIDER THIS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT AND- SOMETHING THAT WE ABSOLUTELY NEED TO DO AND PARTICULARLY THE WAY THAT PORT IS CONSTRUCTED. I THINK IT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT FEATURE WE HAVE. THANK YOU OF. MR LEE THANK YOU CENTER BRADFORD- OBVIOUSLY I'M A PROUD CO AUTHOR OF THIS BILL ANY SPORT TODAY I DID HAVE A QUESTION THOUGH BUT WHEN THE ASPECTS I KNOW YOU TOOK A SERIES OF MOMENTS IS WHEN WOULD THIS- BOARD COMMISSION BE INITIATE WOULD BE AFTER CONCURRENTLY OR BEFORE SAY AN INTERNAL INVESTIGATION TO SAY THERE'S INCIDENT THAT HAPPENED MY HOME TOWN SATURDAY WITH THIS OCCURRED BEFORE INTERNAL INVESTIGATION OR THIS. OCCUR AFTER THEIR INTERNAL INVESTIGATION BY THE LOCAL AGENCY WE HAVE THE FIRST BITE AT THE APPLE THERE THE DETERMINING FACTOR ON WHETHER EIGHT- SERVICE DECERTIFICATION SHOULD MOVE FOR TILL THE BROUHAHA ABOUT GIVING THIS ADVISORY COMMITTEE. OVER REACHING AUTHORITIES JUST. FOOD FOOD AT BEST- THE LOW AGENCY HAS THE FIRST BITE AT IT THEN IT GOES TO THE POLLS COMMISSION THE POST COMMISSION THEN. DETERMINES ITS SIX STEPS THAT ONE HAS TO GO THROUGH BEFORE YOU EVEN GET TO THE CITING OF A OFFICER IS DECERTIFIED AND THEN AFTER THAT. HE STILL HAS THE RIGHT TO APPEAL BE- BEFORE ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE I WISH THE GENERAL PUBLIC AT THAT MANY BITES AT THE APPLE BEFORE THEY WERE FOUND GUILTY OF ANYTHING SO. THIS IS A FAIR TRANSPARENT PROCESS SO ITS FIRST STARTS WITH A LOCAL AIDS IF I'VE ANSWERED YOUR QUESTION THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ANSWER MY QUESTION AND I JUST WANNA ALSO SAY YOU KNOW IT IS IMPORTANT THAT. WE VIEW THIS NOT AS THAT CONCLUSION OF EFFORT TO POTENTIALLY MORE MORE TO COME I THINK THERE WILL BE THAT- HOPEFULLY WHEN WE PASS IT THROUGH OUR HOUSES THERE WILL BE THAT AFTER WHERE PEOPLE SAY WELL WE DID IT WE DON'T HAVE TO REVISIT IT. AND FRANKLY YOU KNOW WHAT WE'VE HAD THESE CONVERSATIONS I THOUGHT WE WOULD TACKLE POLICE'S FIRST BEAT PLEASE THE CERTIFICATION PROCESS BEFORE I EVEN GOT HERE LAST SUMMER WHEN I THINK THERE WAS A GREAT MOMENTUM. AND GREAT INTEREST IN THE PUBLIC AND NOW PEOPLE ARE ASKING WHY DID WE DO LAST YEAR SO NOW WE'RE BACK AT IT AGAIN AND I REALLY DO HOPE THAT WE MAKE THE STRONGER AND MAKE SURE THAT THIS PROCESS DOES WORK. IT'S GOT SIX STEP SO WE HAVE SOME TIME TO SEE IF IT REALLY WORKS OUT AND WE CAN WORK AND WORK IT OUT AND IRON IT OUT. BUT I DO ALSO HERE YOU KNOW THE CONCERNS OPPOSITION WAS IT'S TOO BROAD ISN'T WHAT WE WANT THAT IS ALWAYS WHAT WE ALWAYS HEAR RIGHT THE CITY SUPPORT THE GOAL IS FOR THE PRINCIPLE BUT NEVER BRING US ANYTHING SUBSTANTIAL. AND IF THE ACT OF THE BRING US ANYTHING IT'S ALWAYS MORE THE SAME POLICE POLICING THEMSELVES AND THAT'S WHY IT'S SMART TO HAVE THIS BOARD AND I'M GLAD TO SEE THAT IS PRESERVED IN THIS BILL- THAT IT HAS PEOPLE FROM DIFFERENT WALKS OF LIFE AND SO CALLED. SUPPORTED THANKS AND REFERENCE THANK YOU. BRITISH ACTOR. THANK YOU. SO A COUPLE OF THINGS ON THE ISSUE IT'S OF WHETHER WE NEED THIS OR NOT- WE OBVIOUSLY DO I THINK THERE IS NO- NO DIFFERENCES OF OPINION ON THAT- ONE OF THE REASONS WE NEED THIS IS BECAUSE THE CURRENT EMPLOYMENT LAWS THAT WE HAVE CREATED- MAKE IT VERY DIFFICULT WHEN YOU'RE HIRING SOMEBODY TO FIND OUT MORE ABOUT THEIR PAST AND FIND OUT IF THEY HAVE CHARACTER ISSUES. DIRECT CONFLICT WITH THE ORGANIZATIONAL VALUES THAT YOU HAVE. AND IT YOU CAN ASK CERTAIN QUESTIONS YOU CAN'T ASK OTHER QUESTIONS FORMER EMPLOYERS AREN'T ALLOWED TO GIVE BAD INFORMATION ABOUT TO GIVE NEGATIVE INFORMATION. ABOUT THEIR EMPLOYEES- OTHERWISE THEY CAN BE SUED. AND THIS CREATES THIS ENVIRONMENT WHERE- IT ONCE YOU'VE OFFLOADED AN EMPLOYEE THAT YOU FEEL IS GONE SOUTH. THEY'RE NOT YOUR PROBLEM ANYMORE THEY BECOME SOMEBODY ELSE'S. AND SO ESPECIALLY WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO HAVE. A MECHANISM TO IDENTIFY SOMEBODY THAT CAN NO LONGER UPHOLD THOSE VALUES. AND ON THAT SUBJECT IF YOU GUYS WANT TOLD ME JUST A LITTLE BIT- YOU KNOW I'VE HAD THE HONOR OF WORKING. WITH PEOPLE FROM THE BEGINNINGS OF THEIR CAREER IN LAW ENFORCEMENT. ALL THE WAY TO THE END AND THEN EVEN KNOWING THEM PASS THAT. WHAT HAPPENS IS THEY START OUT AND THEY'RE NOT BAD APPLES IN THAT CHARACTERIZATION KIND OF HURTS. BECAUSE THEY AREN'T BAD APPLES. BUT ALONG THE WAY DEPENDING UPON THE ENVIRONMENT THAT THEY'RE WORKING IN. THEY BECOME TAINTED AND SOMETIMES BY THE MIDDLE OF THEIR CAREERS YOU CAN TELL THAT THEY'RE NOT THE SAME PERSON THAT GOT HIRED WAY BACK WHEN. THEY'VE SEEN THINGS THAT WE SHOULDN'T SEE. OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND THEY DON'T HAVE THE LUXURY OF. LIKE WHEN I WENT TO WORK FOR THE COUNTY WHERE I WENT FROM ONE ENVIRONMENT TO AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT ONE. TO HELP REESTABLISH. THE GOOD THAT'S IN THE WORLD. AND SO BY THE END OF THEIR CAREERS YOU CAN TELL THAT THEY'RE BURNED OUT. AND SOME OF THOSE CAREERS ENDED TWENTY YEARS AND SOME OF THOSE CAREERS GO TO THIRTY AND SOME PEOPLE ACTUALLY MANAGED TO GET THROUGH THEIR ENTIRE CAREERS. AND THERE ARE TAINTED. AND NERVE THERE YOU CAN TELL THEY'RE PSYCHOLOGICALLY DAMAGED. AND THEY'VE GOT PTSD. AND YET. ONCE THEY RETIRE A FEW YEARS LATER. I I'VE RUN INTO PEOPLE THAT ARE DOING GREAT ONE OF THEM IS THE MAYOR OF THE CITY IN THE AREA OUR CITY OF INGLEWOOD. SO YOU KNOW THAT DID TO MAKE IT SOUND LIKE THESE GUYS GET ON BECAUSE THEY DON'T- THE PROCESS DOESN'T ALLOW THEM INITIALLY TO GET IN THERE. THAT THEY'RE JUST BAD APPLES WITH BAD INTENT FROM THE START I THINK IT'S A BAD CHARACTERIZATION OF WHAT IS GOING ON WITH THIS ISSUE. AND ONE OTHER THING. A LOT OF TIMES I'VE SEEN ALONG THE WAY. THAT THE OFFICERS THAT YOU THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. THEY DON'T EVEN LIKE THEMSELVES. AND THEY USUALLY FIX THAT THEMSELVES. AND THOSE ARE THE ONES THAT YOU DON'T READ ABOUT THOSE IN THE PAPER YOU JUST KNOW THEY DIED AND WERE HAVING A FUNERAL AND IT'S USUALLY A QUIET ONE BECAUSE THEY KILL THEMSELVES. SO THIS ISSUE IS A BIG ISSUE. AND HOW WE HANDLE IT IT IS REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT. AND WE HAVE TO GET IT RIGHT. NOW I AM HEARD FROM I'VE HEARD FROM LABOR I'VE HEARD FROM MANAGEMENT I'VE HEARD FROM THE PUBLIC I'VE HEARD FROM MY COLLEAGUES ON BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE. THEY ALL AGREED THAT WE NEED TO HAVE A PROCESS. BUT WE HAVE STAUNCH OPPOSITION TO THIS. NOT JUST FROM OTHER OFFICERS NOT JUST FROM THEM WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CITY'S LEAGUE BECAUSE THEY ARE CONCERNED WITH HOW SOME OF THE LANGUAGE CAN CREATE. ISSUES THAT WILL WIND UP IN COURT AND COSTING THE TAXPAYERS MONEY. BECAUSE IT'S NOT THEIR ORGANIZATIONS TO GET STUDENTS TO TAXPAYERS WHO GET SUED. AND SO THIS IS SO CLOSE. TO BEING THAT BILL. IT JUST NEEDS SOME MORE TWEAKING AND THOSE TWO TWEAKS ARE. THE THAT ONE THE ONE PART WHERE WE'RE LIKE AXE DEMONSTRATING BIAS ON RACE NATIONAL ORIGIN SEXUAL THAT IS SO BROAD IT HAS TO BE NARROWED DOWN IN ORDER TO GET. SUPPORT FOR THAT. THE OTHER ONE IS THE MAKEUP OF THE BOARD AND WHILE I AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUES. THAT THE MAKEUP OF THE BOARD NEEDS TO HAVE PEOPLE. FROM WITHOUT IN ORDER YOU KNOW FROM OUTSIDE THE ORGANIZATION. YOU CAN'T HAVE PEOPLE THAT ARE BIASED. WHEN YOU GO THROUGH A JURY SELECTION. THAT JURY SELECTION ISN'T IT YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE IN A RAPE TRIAL THEY'RE NOT GOING TO PUT SOMEBODY WHO HAS BEEN GREAT ON THE TRIAL TO DETERMINE WHETHER SOMEBODY BECAUSE THAT BIAS. NOW BIAS WILL TAKE THEIR OPINION ABOUT THIS SITUATION THEY'RE DEALING WITH. NOT NECESSARILY THE WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO THEM IN THE PAST WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO PEOPLE IN THE PAST IS IMPORTANT. WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT IN THE BOARD THAT WE MAKE UP. THAT'S WHERE THE OPPOSITION IS. AND THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE TO FIX BECAUSE RIGHT NOW ALTHOUGH YOU SAID IT WAS PRIMARILY FORMED OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. IT'S TWO TO NINE IN THOSE TO OUR GOVERNOR APPOINTED. ONE OF THE QUESTIONS I HAVE FOR YOU IS ONCE THE GOVERNOR MAKES AN APPOINTMENT. AND THEN SAY THE GOVERNOR CHANGES DOES THE NEW GOVERNOR COME IN AND CHANGE THE BOARD ACCORDING THOSE APPOINTMENTS DIZZY. HAVE THE RIGHT TO DECOMMISSION PEOPLE AND THEN APPOINT PEOPLE HE WANTS WOMEN TO TERMINAL LEVEL TERMS OF ONE. WOULD SURVIVE I'M I'M HOPING THAT WE WOULD HONOR JUST LIKE ANY OTHER COMMISSIONS YOU HAVE A TERM IN WHICH YOU SERVE. SERVICE DURING THAT TERM IN THE END THAT GOVERNOR OR- PERSON OR- GET THE SPEAKER THE PROTEOME ALSO WANTED TERM EXPIRES THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO APPOINT. THEIR OWN DESIGNATED INDIVIDUAL TO SERVE ON THE SPORTS BECAUSE THAT ALSO OPENS IT UP TO OBVIOUSLY POLITICS. WHICH A LOT OF THINGS. EVERYTHING ALLOWED I'M POLITICS EVERY POLITICS SENATOR CHARLES YEAH I HEAR YOU. SO. SO ANYWAY THOSE ARE MY CONCERNS WITH THIS BILL. AND IF YOU'RE THOSE THINGS CAN BE A TO. I WOULD BE. TO PUT MY NAME ON IT- GET TO ADD MY SUPPORT TO IT. EVERYBODY WANTS THIS TO HAPPEN. WE NEED TO TAKE CARE OF THE THINGS THAT ARE CAUSING IT NOT TO. SO THANK YOU I APPRECIATE I ALSO WANT TO APPROVE I TELL YOU THAT I JUST REALLY APPRECIATE. YOUR YEARS OF ADVOCACY IN TRYING TO ADDRESS THESE ARE DIFFICULT ISSUES AND I APPRECIATE THAT YOU'RE WORKING SO HARD TO DO TO ADDRESS THEM. IF WE CAN JUST GO A LITTLE BIT FURTHER ON THIS WE CAN PUT SOMETHING IN PLACE STOP TALKING ABOUT OF A PUT SOMETHING IN PLACE. THAT WILL ACTUALLY WORK. AND WORK INTO THE FUTURE AND I APPRECIATE ALSO THAT INTHE FUTURE WHEN WE DO HAVE SOMETHING LIKE THIS THAT IT CONTINUALLY GETS RE EVALUATED. TO ENSURE ITS EFFECTIVENESS IT'S FAIRNESS TO ALL OF THE PEOPLE NOT JUST THE PEOPLE WHO ARE POTENTIALLY THE VICTIMS. BUT ALSO THE POLICE OFFICERS INVOLVED. SO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR INDULGING AREA APPRECIATE THAT YOU BRING IN THE BILL FOR. YES THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN- CENTER I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR GREAT WORK IN THE SPACE THIS IS IT'S A TOUGH ISSUE BUT IT'S AN OBVIOUS ONE THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED THESE ARE HARD CONVERSATIONS- YOU'VE BEEN A TRUE CHAMPION I'M A CO AUTHOR OF PROUD SUPPORTER I'D LIKE TO MOVE THE BILL HAS BEEN MOVED ALREADY I JUST LET MY SUPPORT AND BE AN ALLY FOR YOU AND WHATEVER AS THIS PROCESS GOES THROUGH THANK YOU. RICHARD THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY MORE COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. SENATOR YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU AND LET ME SAY THANK YOU TO EVERYONE WHO IS LENT THEIR VOICE TO THIS MEASURE WHETHER YOU'RE IN SUPPORT OR IN OPPOSITION. BUT I GUESS THE ONE THING THAT TROUBLES ME THE MOST IS THE CONSTANT. CORES OF WE ALL WANT TO CERTIFICATION BUT NOT THIS BILL. AND WE HAVE WORKED FOR YEARS ON WHAT THAT B. O. SHOULD LOOK LIKE AND THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO ARE OPPOSED TO THIS OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND YOU CAN SAY WHAT YOU WANT ABOUT LOCAL GOVERNMENT I SERVED ON LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THE LIABILITIES. I SUIT A CITY. FOR FALSE ARREST A POLICE DEPARTMENT. SO WELL BEFORE THERE WAS THE S. B. TWO W. LISTS SIOUX CITY A GOOD LOCAL ENTITY OF- COUNTY FOR THE MISS ABUSE OF LAW ENFORCEMENT IS IN PLACE NOW FOR THIS BILL DOES NOT CREATE THAT. WE KEEP ONCE AND WE WANT TO WHAT WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE I'VE SAT DOWN WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT. SOME OF MY BEST FRIENDS WHILE LAW ENFORCEMENT SPENT THIRTY FIVE YEARS WITH LAPD WE WENT OVER THIS BILL ALL LAST YEAR ON HOW DO WE MAKE THIS. BILL BETTER HOW DO WE MAKE IT FAIR IF YOU SAW THE L. A. TIMES THIS WEEKEND IT WAS A AMAZING OP ED. BY CHERYL DORSEY FORMER SERGEANT LAPD TWENTY YEARS ON THE DEPARTMENT SHEET WHOLLY SUPPORTS THIS BILL AND SHE'S MMHM CAN'T FIND NO MORE MORE POLICE PER PERSON THAN SHE IS SHE'S NOT ANTI POLICE. SHE PUT HER LIFE ON THE LINE FOR TWENTY YEARS TO PROTECT AND SERVE PEOPLE AND SHE SAYS THIS IS A FAIR AND TRANSPARENT. WAY OF DEALING WITH. BAD OFFICERS AND I'M GONNA DISAGREE WITH YOU THERE ARE BAD APPLES. THERE ARE BAD INDIVIDUALS. AND WHETHER THEIR ELECTED OFFICIALS WHETHER THEIR TEACHERS WHETHER THEIR PRIEST THERE ARE BAD INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE NOT TAINTED BY THE PROCESS THEY'RE JUST BAD INDIVIDUALS. AND WE SEE THAT THE F. B. I.'S EVEN DID A- REPORT A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO ABOUT THE NUMBER OF RECRUITS A BAD INDIVIDUALS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT. FAR MORE THAN ANY OTHER. AGENCY OR EMPLOYMENT. GROUP IN THE STATE ARE IN THE COUNTRY SO THE REALITY IS THAT. AND WE'RE NOT HERE TO TARNISH LAW ENFORCEMENT BECAUSE I SAID I HAVE FAMILY MEMBERS WHO SERVED AS POLICE OFFICERS I HAVE FRIENDS WHO ARE SERVING NOW. MY CHILDHOOD FRIEND MICHAEL BROCK'S HOW THE BOOK OUT BEING BLACK AND BLUE THIRTY FIVE YEARS LAPD. HE'LL TELL YOU EVERYTHING THAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IN THIS BILL NEEDS TO BE DONE. BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE NOT GIVEN THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT. LAW ENFORCEMENT IS ALWAYS GIVEN THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT SO TO BE AFRAID OF SEVEN INDIVIDUALS. BEFORE YOU FEEL THAT THEY WOULD BE ANYMORE BIAS THAN IF THIS. COULD GO. OR BY REPORT WAS COMPRISED OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. I HAVE A NEIGHBOR WHEN A TOP CRIMINAL TO. OF ATTORNEYS IN THE COUNTY OF NOT IN THE STATE WAS APPOINTED TO THE BENCH A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO. AFTER TWO YEARS SITTING ON THE BENCH HE RESIGN. HE RESIGNED BECAUSE OF THE INCESTUOUS RELATIONSHIP THAT EXISTED BETWEEN THE DA THE INVESTIGATING AGENCIES AND THE JUDGES MOSTLY ALL JUDGES. ARE FORMER DA'S AND MOST EVERYBODY MY BEST TO GET FOR THE DA'S OR- FORMER POLICE OFFICERS AND HE SAYS TO GET AN INDICTMENT. ON A POLICE OFFICER LET ALONE. A CONVICTION IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE. IT IS TWO YEARS ON THE BENCH NOT ONE OFFICER WAS EVER IN DIED. SO THIS PROCESS IS NEEDED. THERE WERE THIRTEEN HUNDRED POLICE SHOOTINGS OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS. MOST THIRTEEN HUNDRED POLICE SHOOTINGS THIRTEEN OFFICERS WERE CHARGE. OF THOSE THIRTEEN ONE WAS CONVICTED. YOU TELL ME THAT'S NOT A BIASED STACKED. A REVIEW OF BY SOMEONE. COME ON WE WOULD GO TO VEGAS IN A HEART BEAT WE HAVE THOSE KIND OFF. THE ISSUE IS BEFORE US FOLKS IT'S CLEAR WE'VE DONE POLICING FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS THE SAME WAY. AND WE KEEP GETTING THE SAME RESULTS NOTHING. THIS IS A FAIR PROCESS IT'S A PROCESS IT'S LONG OVERDUE IT'S TIME HAS COME. AND WE MUST TRUST THE SAME PEOPLE WHO TRUST US TO COME HERE TO SACRAMENTO AND MAKE DECISIONS ON ALL ASPECTS OF THEIR LIFE THE BE UNBIASED AND BE FAIR WHY CAN'T WE GIVE THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT OF THOSE SAME CIVILIAN PEOPLE WHO MIGHT BE APPOINTED TO THIS BOARD. TO BE UNBIASED AND FAIR FOR THE SECTOR BIASES ASIDE WERE ASKED TO DO THAT EVERY DAY BUT SOME OF US CAN'T. SOME OF US COME HERE WHAT OUR MINDS MADE UP NO MATTER WHAT THE ISSUE IS AND WE'RE WHETHER TO THAT ISSUE. I'VE ALWAYS TRIED TO BE OPEN TO DISCUSSION AND DEBATE. I'VE LISTENED TO LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND THE ONLY SUGGESTION I HAVE IS NOT THIS BILL MISTER BRADFORD. THAT'S OKAY HOW DO WE MAKE IT BETTER. NOT ALL. EVERYTHING THEY HAVE SUCH A SUGGESTED INPUT PORT KEELS THIS MEASURE. I'M NOT IN THE OPTICS. I'M NOT HERE TO PASS SOMETHING JUST TO SAY I GOT A WIN AND IT DOES NOT THAT FAR TOO OFTEN WE PASS LEGISLATION. HERE IN THE SOUTH IT DOES ABSOLUTELY NOTHING AND WE WAVE OUR HANDS SO WE GOT A VICTORY WE GOT IT ACROSS THE FINISH LINE. YOU RUN FOR OFFICE OR ONE OR TWO REASONS. THE BE SOMETHING OR TO DO SOMETHING. I'M HERE TO DO SOMETHING. THIS IS A COMMON SENSE MEASURE AND I WILL CLOSE WITH A QUOTE FROM DR GRANT KING. HE SAYS. YOU MUST TAKE A POSITION IN LIFE. THAT'S NEITHER SAFE NO POLITICS NO POPULAR YOU TAKE THE POSITION BECAUSE YOU'RE CONSCIOUS TELL YOU IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO THIS IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER. THANK YOU MISTER BRADFORD- AND I KNOW HOW HARD YOU'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS- BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO COME TO THE- TO THE UNDERSTANDING. THAT THIS LEGISLATURE THIS GOVERNOR THE REASON WHERE AT THIS POINT. IS BECAUSE THE INTERNAL MECHANISMS WHETHER SAID INTERNAL AFFAIRS DEPARTMENT THAT DOESN'T GIVE IT ABOUT OFFICERS RESIDENTS SPECTOR GENERAL BEST EITHER. IGNORED WITH THEIR RECOMMENDATIONS ABOUT HOW TO GET RID OF BAD OFFICERS DISHER TOURNEY HAS GRAND JURIES WHICH THEY'VE GONE AND GRAND JURIES AND THEY HAVE NOT CONVICTED BAD OFFICERS. WE BEG. DEPARTMENTS POLICE CHIEFS TO DO THE SAME WE BACK THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. TO COME IN AND DO THE SAME BOTH FEDERAL AND LOCAL. AND WE DIDN'T GET. THE PUBLIC HAS GOTTEN SATISFACTION. AND WHEN IT COMES TO LIKE BACKGROUND CHECKS JUST BASIC BACKGROUND CHECKS ON BAD COPS BETWEEN DEPARTMENTS SMALL DEPARTMENTS DON'T HAVE THE CAPACITY. AS I'VE BEEN TOLD TO DO THAT SO THEY CAN MOVE FROM DEPARTMENT DEPARTMENT. AT THE END OF THE DAY THE BEST PEOPLE TO POLICE POLICE ARE POLICE AND THAT'S NOT BEING DONE. THAT'S WHY WE ARE FORCED. I MEAN I KNOW YOU DON'T WANT TO GO THROUGH ALL THAT HEADACHE BUT WE WERE FORCED. FORCED TO TAKE ACTION. AS A LEGISLATURE BECAUSE- ANYONE PAYING ATTENTION KNOWS THAT THERE HAS BEEN A BREAKDOWN OF TRUST BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND COMMUNITIES ACROSS THIS NATION TOO OFTEN IS BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE SUFFERED AT THE HANDS OF POLICE VIOLENCE AND TOO OFTEN POLICE OFFICERS SEEM TO ESCAPE ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THE VIOLENCE THEY COMMIT. WHETHER IT'S WITH A GUN WITH A CHOKEHOLD OR WITH THE BATON. THERE ARE ALSO OTHER MISCONDUCT CONDUCT THAT DON'T SHOW UP IN THE HEADLINES AS MUCH BUT THEY ALSO HEARD A COMMUNITY. LIKE LYING IN COURT. ADVOCATING POLICE REPORTS. AND COVERING UP EVIDENCE THESE ARE THINGS THAT INFLICT PAIN AND SUFFERING ON COMMUNITIES. WE CANNOT ALLOW THESE THOSE THAT ARE MEANT TO PROTECT THE SURPLUS TO CONTINUE INSPECT INFLICT PAIN AND SUFFERING. SO SENSIBLE DECERTIFICATION LAW SOMETHING THAT STANDS TO BENEFIT US ALL. IT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO HELP OUR COMMUNITIES HEAL AND REGAIN CONFIDENCE IN THE POLICE. IT ALSO SHOWED THAT THE OFFICE TO DO THEIR JOB PROPERLY. AND WITH RESPECT AND THAT THEY ARE THAT THEY ARE VALUED MEMBERS OF OUR SOCIETY WILL HELP MOVE US ALONG. CALIFORNIA QUITE FRANKLY WE'RE LATE TO THE GAME ON DECERTIFICATION. AND AS CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE- AND AS CALIFORNIA'S WE SHOULD BE EMBARRASSED. BUT I WILL SAY EMBARRASSED. FORTY SIX OTHER STATES HAVE ALREADY PASSED US DECERTIFICATION BILL WE BRAG ABOUT BEING AHEAD OF THE GAME ON POLICE REFORM. LOOK FORTY SIX OTHER STATES HAVE DONE. AND WE'RE HERE DEBATING IT RIGHT NOW WE SHOULD BE TO LEADERS IN THIS NOT TRYING TO CATCH UP. SO I BELIEVE IT IS TIME TO DO SOMETHING. THERE WAS ONCE A TIME WHEN LAW FORCED MARRIAGES ASIANS WOULD HAVE FOUGHT TOOTH AND NAIL AGAINST ANY KIND OF DESERTIFICATION BILL. BUT PER PROBLEM HAS BECOME BAD ENOUGH THAT I BELIEVE. THAT EVERY LAW ENFORCEMENT GROUP THAT I'VE SPOKEN TO SEEM TO BELIEVE THAT WE- WE DO IN FACT NEED SOME KIND OF THE CERTIFICATION PROCESS. THEY MAY NOT LIKE EVERY ASPECT OF HIS BILL BUT ON SOME LEVEL THEY KNOW THAT APPEARED TO CERTIFICATION PRODUCT BILL IS THE RIGHT DIRECTION TO GO IN. IT'S TIME FOR US TO TAKE ACTION. AND WE SAID IT AGAIN THIS TIME FOR US TO TAKE ACTION WE HAVE SEEN IN A VIOLENT TO DISMISS TRUST IN OUR COMMUNITIES. AGAIN I WANT TO THANK CENTER BRADFORD FOR BRING THIS IMPORTANT LEGISLATION I WANT TO COMMEND HIM FOR HIS PERSEVERANCE IN THE FACE OF IMPASSIONED PLEAS. AND CRITICISM FROM PEOPLE FROM BOTH SIDES. LET ME REPEAT THAT ON BOTH SIDES OF THIS DEBATE. BUT I ALSO HOPE THERE WILL BE ROBUST CONVERSATION ABOUT THIS BILL AND THAT NOT ONLY DO WE VOTE ON IT THAT WE GET IT DONE. THAT SB TWO- BEGINS THE PROCESS. THAT WE GET RID OF. OFFICERS WHO ARE GIVING CALIFORNIA THE POLICE DEPARTMENT AND JUST JUST MAKING IT DIFFICULT FOR RESIDENTS OF THIS OF THIS COMMUNITY- TO BE ABLE TO HAVE TRUST IN OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES WHO CHAIRS RECOMMENDING AND IBOOK. THANK MAY CALL THE ROLL. SB TWO BY SENATE BRADFORD THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE APPROPRIATIONS JONES SAWYER JONES SAWYER IRAQI LACKEY NEL BARAKAT LEAKED LEE HIGH COURT ALL RIGHT I SAN DIEGO. SENT I ARE TOO NO THE OUR TURN WICKS WICKS I. THE MEASURE PASSES THANK THANK YOU YOU NOW A ITEM TWO S. FIVE EIGHT SIX BRADFORD CRIMINAL FEES THANK YOU MISTER AWFULLY THIS WON'T BE AS CONTROVERSIAL- I'M HERE TO PRESENT PRESENT SB FIVE EIGHT SIX WHICH ELIMINATES CRIMINAL ADMINISTRATIVE FEES. FOR TOO LONG IN OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM WE HAVE MADE PEOPLE WHO ARE INVOLVED. TO BEAR THE COSTS CREATED BY GOVERNMENT PROCESSES TO FEES THAT CAN ADD UP TO BE THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS LEADING FOLKS IN GREAT DEBT THESE ADMINISTRATIVE FEES CREATE DEBT SEEM COLD IT MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE GET CAUGHT UP IN IT SCAPE FROM. THIS TO SUPPORT THIS PROPOTIONALLY IMPACT AGAIN PEOPLE OF COLOR- AND 80% OF THEM QUALIFY FOR ENDANGERED. INDIGENT SERVICES FROM OUR PUBLIC DEFENDERS WE NEED TO GIVE PEOPLE THEIR FAMILIES AND THEIR COMMUNITIES A CHANCE TO CLEAN WITH A FOURTH CLEAN START WITHOUT FIRST DROPPING THEM IN DEBT THESE FEES ARE REGRESSIVE TAXES THAT DO THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT THEY WERE INTENDED FOR. WELL WE CAN DO THIS WHILE STILL HOLDING PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE PEOPLE WHO NEED TO SERVE TIME ARE STILL REQUIRED TO DO THAT PEOPLE WHO NEED TO PAY FINES WILL STILL BE REQUIRED TO DO THIS THIS BILL SIMPLY ELIMINATES OR MODIFIES TWENTY SIX ADMINISTRATIVE FEES AND OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. THIS IS- NOT ON PRESIDENT AND LAST YEAR WE PASSED AB EIGHTEEN SIXTY NINE THE BUDGET TRAILER BILL THAT ELIMINATED TWENTY SIX FROM FEES EFFECTIVE. JANUARY ONE OF THIS YEAR. THIS YEAR'S BY BILL. A HUNDRED AND FIFTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS- IN THE FISCAL YEAR TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. AND SUBSEQUENT YEARS TO ELIMINATE ADDITIONAL CRIMINAL FEES THAT'S INCLUDING I MEAN THAT FUNDING IS CONTINGENT UPON FURTHER LEGISLATION- THE COMMITTEE ACT ANALYSIS RAISES A QUESTION AS TO WHETHER THIS BILL IS NEEDED BATTERIES YES. THUS FAR WE DO NOT HAVE A BUDGET TRAILER BILL TO ADDRESS WHAT FEES WILL BE ELIMINATED. THOUGH WE ANTICIPATE SOMETHING NOW WILL BE COMING ON HOPEFULLY THIS IN THE NEAR FUTURE. THIS BILL CREATES THE FOUNDATION FOR THAT CONVERSATION AND I STAND READY TO WORK. WITH THE BUDGET CHAIRS AN APPROPRIATIONS YEARS OF BOTH HOUSES TO HELP MOVE OUT FORD AND ELIMINATING THESE FEES. IN ADDITION EACH YEAR WE HAVE CHIPPED MORE MORE OF THE FEES AWAY USING- COMPLIMENT JERRY- BUDGET AND POLICY TOOL PROCESSES. AS IT IS THE STRONGEST WAY TO MOVE ANYTHING FORWARD INVOLVING A LOT OF MONEY. I HAVE TWO WITNESSES HERE TODAY ON TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT- FATIMA- MORE BOND- IS- WHO'S AN INDIVIDUAL WHO'S BEEN IMPACTED BY FEES. AND THEN OUR SECOND ONE I WOULD THIS WOULD BE ASK YOUR WEIGHT JONES A STAFF ATTORNEY AND CLINICAL SUPERVISOR IS EAST BAY COMMUNITY LAW CENTER.

IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN I RECEIVED THE TRAFFIC MISDEMEANOR WAS CHARGED HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS IN THE CRIMINAL FEES INCLUDING IF YOU TO GET ON A PAYMENT PLAN.

JOSH DUGGAR REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES IN ON BEHALF OF MY COLLEAGUES WITH URBAN COUNTIES OF CALIFORNIA AND RURAL COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES OF CALIFORNIA WE'RE NOT OPPOSED TO THE MEASURE OR THE UNDERLYING POLICY BUT HAVE CONCERNS WITH THE FISCAL IMPACT ON COUNTIES AND ARE GRATEFUL DOCTORS WORKING WITH US TO ADDRESS OUR CONCERNS THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. THERE IS NO ONE ELSE TO SIGNAL THAT THEY WISH TO SPEAK OKAY. BRING YOU BACK TO THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS ANYONE WITH ANY QUESTIONS CONCERNS. YES MISS WICKS JUST WHEN I THINK THE AUTHOR FOR THE BELOVED OF MYSELF AS A CO AUTHOR AND HAVING TO MOVE THE BILL TODAY THANK YOU. ANY OTHER MEMBER IS BARKEVIOUS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU FATHER FOR BRINGING THIS I THINK THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT STEP I KNOW THAT FOR YEARS WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS ISSUE- IN BOTH HOUSES TO ADDRESS THE INEQUITABLE FEES THAT ARE IN THE SYSTEM- I WANT TO REITERATE WHAT THE ONE PERSON WHO CALLED IN OPPOSITION THIS IS AN UNJUST WAY TO GET VICTIMS RESTITUTION AND THIS NEEDS TO CHANGE AND I'M EXCITED TO SUPPORT IT TODAY BUT I THINK WE AS A BODY NEED TO ENSURE WE'RE PROTECTING VICTIMS BY FUNDING THERE'S RESTITUTION FINES I KNOW- I THINK WE ALL AGREE ABOUT THAT BUT I JUST WANT TO. PUT IT ON THE RECORD THAT I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT WORK WE HAVE AHEAD OF US THANK YOU THANK YOU ANY ONE ELSE RESEARCHERS ARE THANK YOU. START MY A- WITH THIS IS THERE ARE. THAT HAVE THE- TO PAY. AND SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THAT- BECAUSE THERE ARE A LOT OF PROGRAMS THAT ARE GOOD PROGRAMS THAT ARE FUNDED BY THIS INCLUDING THE VICTIMS COMPENSATION FUND. WHICH IS RIGHT NOW SUFFERING BECAUSE THEY DON'T COLLECT ENOUGH OF THOSE FEES AND A LOT OF PEOPLE AREN'T PAYING. BUT YEAH YOU KNOW IT'S- A LIMITING FOR EVERYBODY. SIMPLY FINANCIALLY IMPACT THESE PROGRAMS- I THINK WHERE WE SHOULD SPEND OUR TIME IS ENSURING THAT PEOPLE THAT DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO PAY- THAT LIMITATION SHOULD BE RECOGNIZED. AND WE SHOULDN'T WASTE OUR TIME TRYING TO COLLECT FEES FROM PEOPLE LIKE THAT. THEY DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO PAY- IF I DECIDE TO ZIP DOWN THE FREEWAY AT A HUNDRED AND TEN MILES AN HOUR AND I GET PULLED OVER AND THEN I DON'T SHOW UP TO COURT. EVERYTHING THAT EVERY EVERY COST ALONG THE WAY. SHOULD BE BORNE BY ME BECAUSE I'M THE ONE WHO CREATED THAT THE NECESSITY FOR EVEN HAVING TO. CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM- SO. I WOULD RATHER SEE A BILL THAT. DEALS WITH THE PART WHERE THE PEOPLE THAT CAN'T PAY ARE NOT MADE TO HAVE TO PAY RESTITUTION WHEN THEY CAN'T AND IT DOESN'T AFFECT THEM GOING ON DOWN INTO THE FUTURE THE STARGATE YOU KNOW TO CHASE AND- CHASING SOMETHING THAT YOU NEED YOU CAN'T GET YOUR SPEND MORE MONEY CHASING IT THEN YOU CAN. RIGHT TO JUST SIMPLY WIPE IT OUT SO THAT EVERYBODY WHO. BY THEIR OWN ACTIONS WINDS UP ACCESSING A SYSTEM THAT IS MEANT TO PROTECT US- YEAH LAW BIDING CITIZENS. I IT TO ME IT'S DOING MORE HARM THAN GOOD. SO I STRUGGLE WITH THAT BECAUSE OF THIS THANKS. THANK YOU ANYMORE QUESTIONS CONCERNS. YOU MAY CLOSE WAS BRADFORD. THANK YOU IS SURE AND I WANT TO RESPOND AND LET ME BE VERY CLEAR. THIS BILL HAS NO IMPACT ON DOMESTIC VIOLENCE PROGRAMS THAT HAVE NO IMPACT ON VICTIMS IN THE RESTITUTION PROGRAM- AND IT HAS NO NEGATIVE IMPACT. ON ANY OF THE FUNDING OF VICTIMS PROGRAMS THIS BILL DEALS WITH THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE DESTITUTE WHO CANNOT AFFORD WE WOULD HOPE THAT THOSE ARE DOUBLE GOOD PEOPLE THAT WE ALL KNOW OUT THERE WHO COULD AFFORD TO PAY WILL PAY. JUST LIKE THEY WILL PAY THEIR SPEEDING TICKETS THEY WILL PAY THEIR FEES AND FINE JOB THAT WHOLE TO COURT BUT RIGHT NOW THESE FEES ARE ADDITIONAL WE'RE NOT SEEING PEOPLE ARE. ABSOLVED FROM PAYING THEIR FINE WE'RE SEEING DO NOT TACK ON ADDITIONAL FEES FOR POOR PEOPLE WHO STRUGGLED TO PAY THE FINE. IF YOU'RE GUILTY OF SPEEDING YOU STILL HAVE TO PAY THAT SPEEDING TICKET WERE SEEN IF YOU FAIL TO APPEAR IN COURT YOU SHOULDN'T BE TAPPED ON ADDITIONAL FEE FOR FAILING TO SHOULD SHOW UP IN COURT. YOUR PENALTY WILL BE YOU WILL BE FOUND GUILTY AND HAVE TO PAY THAT TICKET FOR FAILURE. TO APPEAR SO THIS IS WHAT THIS MEASURES TO COMMONSENSE MEASURE IT'S NOT NEW TO THIS LEGISLATURE AND WE'RE JUST EXPANDING UPON WHAT WE ALL KNOW IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO AND WE SHOULDN'T BE. BALANCING OUR GOVERNMENT- ON POOR PEOPLE AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. THANK YOU. BEEN PROPERLY MOVED AND SECONDED THE- JUDGE RECOMMEND I VOTE. CALL THE ROLL. ON SB FIVE.

ASSEMBLY MEMBER WICKS IS SUBSTITUTING FOR SENATOR WE. K. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY STEVEN COLLEAGUES I'M OF A PROUD CO AUTHOR AND I'M PRESENTING SP THREE FIFTY SEVEN ON BEHALF OF SENATOR SCOTT WIENER TODAY. SB THREE FIFTY SEVEN IS A SYMBOL BILL THAT WILL REPEAL PROVISIONS OF THE LAW THAT CRIMINALIZED LOITERING FOR THE INTENT TO ENGAGE IN SEX WORK. THIS LEGISLATION ALSO PERMITS THE SEALING OF RECORDS FOR ANYONE PREVIOUSLY CONVICTED OF THE SLAUGHTERING OFFENSE. AND PROVIDES RESENTENCING FOR ANYONE CURRENTLY INCARCERATED FOR THESE OFFENSES. SINCE ITS ENACTMENT IN NINETEEN NINETY FIVE THIS MISDEMEANOR OFFENSE HAS FAILED TO PROTECT PUBLIC SAFETY AND IS DISPROPORTIONATELY ENFORCED AGAINST BLACK AND BROWN TRANSGENDER WOMEN. DUE TO THE BROAD AND SUBJECTIVE NATURE OF THIS OFFENSE LAW ENFORCEMENT IS PERMITTED TO PROFILE PEOPLE AND STOP THEM FOR INHERENTLY DISCRIMINATORY REASONS. SUCH AS WEARING REVEALING CLOTHING WHILE TAKING WHILE TALKING TO PEOPLE IN AN AREA WHERE SEX WORK HAS OCCURRED BEFORE. CRIMINALIZING PEOPLE FOR LOITERING WITH INTENT TO ENGAGE IN SEX WORK SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASES THE MISTRUST BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND TARGETED COMMUNITIES. WHICH IS A TO SAFETY BECAUSE IT RAINED. THE LONG FOR IS NOT PROTECT INCREASE UNSAFE. WERE SEXUAL EXPLOITS VIA. OR MORE LIKELY TO OCCUR. WE ALL HAVE AN INTEREST IN PREVENTING HUMAN. BUT THE LAWYER LAW NOT AN EFFECTIVE WAY DO SO AND IS NOW USED TO ADDRESS TRAFFICKING. LAW ENFORCEMENT SHOULD NOT BE USING THE LOITERING STATUTE TO REST PERSONS SELLING SEX INCLUDING THOSE BEING TRAFFICKED AS A WAY TO PROVIDE THEM SERVICES ARE IDENTIFY HUMAN TRAFFICKING SURVIVORS. THIS PRACTICE RE VICTIMIZES PERSONS WHO'VE BEEN TRAFFICKED AND LEAVES THEM WITH CRIMINAL RECORDS THAT CREATE FURTHER BARRIERS TO SEEKING EMPLOYMENT HOUSING OR IMMIGRATION RELIEF. LEADING TRAUMA INFORMED AN ANTI TRAFFICKING ORGANIZATIONS LIKE COALITION TO ABOLISH SEX TRAFFICKING. ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDER LEGAL OUT REACH AND JUSTICE AT LAST UNDERSTAND THAT HUMAN TRAFFICKING SURVIVORS ARE HARMED BY THE ENFORCEMENT OF THIS LOITERING LAW WHICH IS WHY THEY STRONGLY SUPPORT. SB THREE FIFTY SEVEN. THIS BILL DOES NOT DECRIMINALIZE SOLICITATION OR SOLICITING OR ENGAGING IN SEX WORK. SB THREE FIFTY SEVEN SIMPLY ELIMINATES AN ANTI LITTERING OFFENCE THAT RESULTS IN THE LEGAL HARASSMENT OF THE L. G. B. T. Q. PLUS. BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES FOR SIMPLY EXISTING AND LOOKING LIKE A SEX WORKER TO LAW ENFORCEMENT. ON THE PHONE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF SB THREE FIFTY SEVEN ARE.

THANK YOU FOR HEARING ME I'M ANGIE BENNETT- I'M A CALIFORNIA INDIAN A TEACHER A LIBERAL A FEMINIST A DEMOCRAT AND ANTI HUMAN TRAFFICKING ADVOCATE THE STRAIGHT GAY ALLIANCE ADVISER AT MY SCHOOL. I OPPOSE THIS BILL THE BILL DOES NOTHING TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM OF HARASSMENT OF ILLEGAL SEX WORKERS BY LAW ENFORCEMENT INSTEAD IT REPEALS A LAW ORDERING ORDINANCE CIRCUM NAVIGATING AND UNDERMINING THE VALIDITY OF PENAL LAW AND TAKING SOMETHING AWAY BUT GETTING NOTHING BACK. WE HAVE A REPORT WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT IN OUR AREA BECAUSE LAW ENFORCEMENT IN KERN COUNTY IS TRAINED IN VICTIM CENTERED APPROACH TOWARDS PROSTITUTION. I PERSONALLY WORK WITH AT LEAST SEVEN WOMEN WHO ARE ABLE TO CHANGE THEIR LIVES BECAUSE LAW ENFORCEMENT DETAINED TO THEM BUT THEN CALLED US INSTEAD OF ARRESTING THEM WHY IS THE BREACH OF TRUST BETWEEN COPS AND SEX WORKERS NOT ADDRESSED WHEN THIS IS THE FOUNDATION OF THE ARGUMENT. AMENDMENTS TO SECTION NINE ON PAGES ELEVEN AND TWELVE OF THIS BILL PROMISED TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF EXPLOITED MINORS YET NOTHING TO RETRAIN LAW ENFORCEMENT REGARDING PROFILING ARE HELPING RACE BROWN OR- TGI ADULT. PROSTITUTION ISN'T ONLY A RACE OR GENDER ISSUE IT IS A POVERTY ISSUE. IT'S DISPROPORTIONATE STATISTICS REFLECT THE POOREST MEMBERS OF OUR SOCIETY THIS BILL LEAVES THEM WITH NOTHING WRITTEN INTO IT TO MAKE A CHANGE IN CULTURE OR CLIMATE. THE PROBLEMATIC SAFER STREETS FOR ALL ACT CLAIMS TO END DISCRIMINATION AGAINST AND VIOLENCE TOWARDS SEX WORKERS BUT THERE ARE NO SOLUTIONS IN THE BILL THAT ACTUALLY DO THAT. THERE ARE WAYS TO PROTECT SEX WORKERS BUT AT THIS TIME I DO NOT FEEL THAT THIS BILL IS YET PLEASE I ENCOURAGE YOU TO ABSTAIN OR VOTE NO ON SB THREE FIFTY SEVEN THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU NEXT. HI MY NAME IS MARYANN JACKSON ON THE FACILITY DIRECTOR OF RESTORATION RANCH WOMAN CHILDREN BAKERSFIELD CALIFORNIA. I HELP SURVIVORS OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING AND COMMERCIAL SEX INDUSTRY RESTORE THEIR LIVES AND I'M SURVIVORS MYSELF AS WELL. IT IS VERY DANGEROUS FOR WOMEN WORKING ON THE STREETS TO GET INTO A STRANGER'S VEHICLE BECAUSE THEY HAVE BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO IDEA WHERE THE DRIVER OF THE VEHICLE WILL BE TAKING THEM. AND THERE'S LITTLE OR NO WITNESSES AND I PERSONALLY HAVE HAD A COLLEAGUE WHERE SHE WAS A STREET WALKER. GOT INTO A VEHICLE WITH THE DOOR DID NOT OPEN SHE WAS TAKEN TO AN UNKNOWN LOCATION. AND ROBBED AND BEATEN AND RAPED. ACCORDING TO. THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT NEW YORK TIMES ARTICLE IN THE U. S. PROSECUTOR FIFTY ONE TIMES MORE LIKELY TO BE MURDERED. ON THE JOB THAN LIQUOR STORE EMPLOYEES. AT IT IS THE SECOND DEADLIEST WORK ENVIRONMENT FOR WOMEN AND FOR THAT REASON I OPPOSE SB THREE FIFTY SEVEN. THANK YOU THANK YOU. SIR. HELLO MY NAME IS DR DIAGRAM. I AM THE FOUNDER OF THE FIVE OH ONE C. THREE NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION MAGDELEINE HOPE WE FOUND THAT BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINE. ORGANIZATION IS CONDUCTED ST OUR REACH TO OVER TEN THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS IN THE COMMERCIAL SEX INDUSTRY. AND I PERSONALLY ASSISTED ONE HUNDRED TWENTY THREE WOMEN OUT OF SEX TRAFFICKING. SADISTIC SHOW THE AVERAGE AGE OF A CHILD. THAT ENTERS IN HUMAN TRAFFICKING IS ELEVEN TO FOURTEEN YEARS OLD ACCORDING TO THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY. OUR RESEARCH WE HAVE COMPILED OVER LAST TWELVE YEARS SHOWS THAT SEVEN OUT OF TEN PROSTITUTES ARE NOT WORKING BY CHOICE WITH THEIR ACTUALLY. SEXUALLY EXPLOITED AND SOMEONE IS PROFITING FROM THEM BY FORCE FRAUD OR COERCION. MAKING THEM A VICTIM OF SEX TRAFFICKING. WHENEVER THERE IS LEGALIZED PROSTITUTION THERE'S AN INCREASE IN HUMAN TRAFFICKING ACCORDING TO A HARVARD LOS OUR SCHOOL STUDY. WELL THERE'S RESEARCH THAT SUGGESTS OF LEGALIZATION OF PROSTITUTION CAN LOWER INCIDENCE OF VIOLENCE AND DISEASE. AFFLICTING CONSENTING SEX WORKERS IT WOULD INCREASE IN PREVALENCE OF SEX TRAFFICKING IN FURTHER INHIBIT LAW ENFORCEMENT'S EFFORTS TO INTERVENE. THE SERVER WAS MENTAL IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN OVER ONE WEEK PERIOD THE CARD TO CALIFORNIA DOES NOT REFLECT THE ISSUES AT LARGE IS TO LAW ENFORCEMENT'S EFFORTS OF INDIVIDUALS WORKING THE STREETS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. DUE TO OUR EFFORTS DAD AND FIRST HAND KNOWLEDGE OF WORKING WITH INDIVIDUALS IN THE COMMERCIAL SECTOR INDUSTRY. I BELIEVE THAT LEGALIZING LOITERING. FOR THE PURPOSE OF ENGAGING IN PROSTITUTION WOULD BE CATASTROPHIC. I WOULD ALLOW TRAFFICKERS THE ABILITY TO SELL MORE MINORS AND ADULTS ON THE STREETS OF CALIFORNIA. NOT MAKING OUR STREETS SAFER FOR ALL FOR THESE REASONS I'M ASKING FOR A NO A NAY VOTE QUARTER OF STAIN FROM PASSING. SB THREE FIVE SEVEN THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

THANK YOU NOW BRING ABOUT TO ARE BEING OUT. WE NOW BRING BETTER COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS AND- OR ROUTE. DISMISSES HERE TO ALL RIGHT SO M. I HAVE TO OPPOSE THE BILL AND SAY THAT RIGHT AWAY- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT KEEPS BEING BROUGHT UP IS BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES. AND IT JUST BARELY AFFECTED BROCKTON BROWN COMMUNITIES AND YOU KNOW I HAD THE HONOR OF SERVING A BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITY FOR A LONG MANY MANY MANY YEARS. AND THE FAMILIES THAT LIVE IN BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES DON'T WANT CRIME THEY DON'T WANT THEIR KIDS EXPOSED TO CRIME THEY DON'T WANT THEIR- KIDS EXPOSED TO THE NEGATIVE ELEMENTS THEY JUST WANT TO LIVE THEIR LIVES JUST LIKE EVERYONE ELSE DOES IN ANY OTHER COMMUNITY. AND YET WE'RE MAKING EXCUSES WHY IT'S OKAY FOR THEM TO HAVE TO TELL THEIR KID HEY WHEN YOU WALK TO SCHOOL OR COME HOME FROM SCHOOL. YOU NEED TO TAKE THE SECURED AS ROUTE TO GET HOME BECAUSE OTHERWISE YOU'RE GOING TO GO BY THE CORNER. THAT HAS FOLKS THAT ARE ENGAGE IN SEX WORK TRAFFIC AND A LOT OF TIMES THOSE FOLKS ARE ALSO HAVE DRUG PROBLEMS- AND THAT'S WHAT THEY DO TO SUPPORT THEIR DRUG HABITS. AND SO THEY HAVE. YOU KNOW SHIFTY CHARACTERS BETTER HANG AROUND. AND THIS IS ONE OF THOSE TYPE OF BILLS THAT IS ACTUALLY TAKING A TOOL AWAY. FROM PEOPLE THAT ARE ACTUALLY TRYING TO HELP THESE FOLKS. THEY'RE TRYING TO GIVE THEM THAT OUTLET. AND ARE DIFFERENT TO BE ABLE TO BE- ARE ARRESTED. AND THEN GIVEN THE CHOICE OF DO THEY WANT HELP AND THEY DON'T SPEND MUCH TIME IN IN JAIL THEY USUALLY GET CITED AND RELEASED. SO I DON'T KNOW HOW THIS HELPS. THOSE FOLKS THAT LIVE IN BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES I DON'T KNOW HOW THIS HELPS FOLKS THAT DON'T WANT TO BE HUMAN YOU KNOW HUMAN A PART OF THE HUMAN TRAFFICKING RINGS THAT ARE OUT THERE- I DON'T THINK REMOVING THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS IS GOING TO SOLVE A PROBLEM FOR THOSE COMMUNITIES. I THINK WE NEED TO HAVE MORE MORE ACTIVITY TO BE ABLE TO HELP THOSE FOLKS. THAT ARE BEING THERE ARE BEING HUMAN TRAFFICKED. AND THIS ISN'T IT. THIS IS GOING EXACTLY OPPOSITE DIRECTION THIS MAKING COMMUNITIES LESS SAFE IT'S EXPOSING KEEP FAMILIES THAT ARE GOOD LAW ABIDING FAMILIES. THIRD TO MORE OF THIS STUFF THAT THEY DON'T WANT IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. SO YEAH I HAVE TO OPPOSE IT- AND YOU KNOW I'VE I FOLKS BUT WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO HELP THEM. THANK YOU. FOR YOUR- INPUT MISTER POWER K. THANK YOU MR THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- SO I THINK THAT YOU KNOW I'M TERRY BILLS TO SUPPORT VICTIMS OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING I THINK HUMAN TRAFFICKING IS. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE AS A LEGISLATURE SHOULD CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON WITH EVERYTHING WE'VE GOT I SPEAKS AT THE DAYS THAT I HAVE A PRIVILEGE OF WORKING WITH AND THEY SAY THAT THE PROBLEM JUST CONTINUES TO EXACERBATE AND WHAT WE'RE DOING ISN'T WORKING AND SO. I THINK THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOWEVER HOW CRIMINALIZING THE VICTIMS OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING WHICH IS WHAT THIS LAW CURRENTLY DOES IT IS NOT A HUMAN TRAFFICKERS WHO ARE LOITERING IT IS THE VICTIMS OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING THAT ARE LOITERING HELPS THOSE VICTIMS AND SO I THINK WE NEED TO FIND REAL WAYS TO HELP THOSE VICTIMS RATHER THAN CRIMINALIZING THEM. ENSURING THEY GET THE SUPPORT THEY NEED. AND I WANT TO BE REALLY CLEAR ABOUT WHAT THIS BILL DOES NOT DO. THIS BILL DOES NOT LEGALIZE PROSTITUTION THE AFTER PROSTITUTION ITSELF WILL STILL BE A CRIME. IT IS MERELY THE PRECURSOR LOITERING THAT IS BEING DEALT WITH IN THIS LEGISLATION. AND SO AGAIN IF SOMEBODY ACTUALLY. COMMITTING THE ACTS OF PROSTITUTION THAT MADE OUT WITH UNDER THE RELEVANT SECTIONS- EVEN AFTER THIS BILL. IS ENACTED INTO LAW IF IT SO DOES SO I THINK THAT. YOU KNOW. I APPRECIATE THE OPPOSITION'S POINTS BUT I THINK THAT THERE ARE BETTER WAYS TO HELP VICTIMS THAN CRIMINALIZING THAT I PUSH IT THIS AND I. WILL MOVE THE BILL IF IT IS NOT ALREADY BEEN MOVED. OKAY ANY MORE COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS YOU MAY CLOSE WITH WICKS FOR THE WINNER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS BY BOTH OF MY COLLEAGUES HERE ON THE DYESS YOU KNOW. I CANNOT SPEAK FOR THE BLACK OR BROWN COMMUNITY BECAUSE I'M NOT BLACK OR BROWN- AND I HAVE NOT HAD THOSE EXPERIENCES AND MY UPBRINGING- BUT I CAN LOOK AT THE DATA. AND THE DATA SHOWS THAT BLACK ADULTS ACCOUNT FOR LOS ANGELES FIFTY SIX POINT 1% OF THE CHARGES DESPITE MAKING UP ONLY EIGHT POINT 9% OF THE CITY. CITY'S POPULATION. AND WHAT I VENTURE TO GUESS IS THAT THE BLACK AMERICAN DOES NOT LIKE TO BE SUBJECT TO DISCRIMINATORY POLICING POLICIES. AND THAT IS WHAT THIS BILL AIMS TO DO IS TO ADDRESS THOSE. AND BY ARRESTING THOSE THAT ARE FOR THESE LITTERING CHARGES THIS RE VICTIMIZE THE REMIX RE VICTIMIZES PERSONS WHO. ARE BEING TRAFFICKED AND LEAVES THEM WITH CRIMINAL RECORDS SO WHILE THEY MAY NOT SPENT A LOT OF TIME IN JAIL THEY DO HAVE CRIMINAL RECORDS TO. DEAL WITH- WHICH LEAD TO FURTHER BARRIERS FOR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING AND MANY OTHER SERVICES SO AS A SURPRISE A CO AUTHOR OF THE BILL I'M IN A SUPPORTER OF IT I APPRECIATE MY COLLEAGUES COMMENTS HERE HOW TO REALLY GET TO THIS. AND THAT'S WHY- THIRD NUMBER OF BOTH LGBTQ ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE SUPPORTING THIS BILL AS WELL AS ORGANIZATIONS THE WORKDAY NIGHT TO END HUMAN TRAFFICKING AND SO WE STAND WITH THEM AND I STAND WITH THEM AND I WOULD ASK YOU ALL DO AS WELL AND RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH- IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE LEGISLATURE PASSED SB FOURTEEN THIRTY SEVEN AUTHORED BY CENTER SKINNER WITH BIPARTISAN SUPPORT WHICH CHANGE THE LONG HELD AN UNJUST FELONY MURDER RULE. THAT WAS OVERLY PUNITIVE TO THOSE WHO DID NOT KILL OR INTENT TO KILL A LOT OF PATHWAY FOR PEOPLE WHO TOOK PLEA DEALS TO LESSER CHARGES SUCH AS MANSLAUGHTER SUPPLIED RESENTENCING. AND WAS A LANDMARK PIECE OF LEGISLATION. HOWEVER WHAT IS OCCURRED SINCE THEN IS THAT SOME COURTS INCORRECTLY REASON THAT ONLY APPLIED TO MURDER AND NOT ATTEMPTED MURDER THIS- THESE COURTS HAVE BARRED PEOPLE FROM APPLYING FOR RESENTENCING WHICH LED AN ABSURD AND- UNFAIR SITUATION WHERE PEOPLE ARE ELIGIBLE FOR RESENTENCING IF THE VICTIM DIED. BUT AN ELIGIBLE IF THE VICTIM DID NOT DIE THIS MEANS AT LEAST COUPLE PEOPLE ARE STILL SERVING DECADES IN PRISON EVEN THOUGH THEY SHOULD BE ELIGIBLE. FOR RELIEF. THIS BILL BUILDS ON FOURTEEN THIRTY SEVEN BY CLARIFYING EXISTING LAW TO INCLUDE VOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER AND ATTEMPTED MURDER CONVICTIONS. AS ELIGIBLE FOR RELIEF UNDER SB FOURTEEN THIRTY SEVEN. IT ALSO ALLOWS FOR COUNSEL BE APPOINTED IN PETITIONS FOR RESENTENCING. AND ESTABLISH A PROCESS FOR THOSE WHOSE MURDER ATTEMPTED MURDER OR MANSLAUGHTER CONVICTIONS HIS FINAL TO IN TO APPEAL. THIS WILL ASSIST HUNDREDS OF INCARCERATED PEOPLE THAT TELL COURSE TEAM HAVE BEEN EXCLUDED BY THE TECHNICAL LANGUAGE OF SB FOURTEEN THIRTY SEVEN. AND THOUSANDS OF SIMILAR PEOPLE WHO DID NOT PROPOSITIONS YET BECAUSE OF THE COURT RULINGS IT'S CO SPONSORED BY THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDER ASSOCIATION. AND CALIFORNIA ATTORNEYS FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE I HAVE SEVERAL PEOPLEONLINE TESTIFYING RESPECTFULLY URGE AN AYE VOTE. SECOND. OKAY AND NOW WE HEAR FROM YOUR WITNESS IS AV THE ERROR CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDER ASSOCIATION VIA TELEPHONE R. A. J. KITCHEN'S OFFICE OF STATE PUBLIC DEFENDER VIA TELEPHONE. YOUR FIVE MINUTES TOTAL BOTH. WHENEVER YOU'RE READY TO BEGIN OPERATOR OPEN UP THE LINE. THIS IS AJ CONNECTIONS FROM- THE OFFICE OF THE STATE PUBLIC DEFENDER- GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN HONORABLE MEMBERS- TO- AMPLIFY SOME WHAT WOULD THAT CENTER BACKERS SAID THE PURPOSE OF SENATE BILL FOURTEEN THIRTY SEVEN WAS TO ENSURE THAT THE PUNISHMENT INDIVIDUALS RECEIVE IS IN PROPORTION TO THE BLAME WORTHINESS OF THAT INDIVIDUAL'S OWN ACTIONS BUT SOME JUDICIAL INTERPRETATIONS HAVE CREATED- GAPS IN THE LAW AS SENATOR BAKER SAID THIS IS LED TO SOME UNFAIR IN TRULY ABSURD RESULTS- THE SENATOR INDICATED SOME COURTS ARE EXCLUDING FROM. SB FOURTEEN THIRTY SEVEN ANYONE CONVICTED OF ATTEMPTED MURDER WHICH MEANS THAT A NON SHOOTER WHO CAN NOT BE LIABLE FOR MURDER IF THE VICTIM IS SHOT AND KILLED WILL FACE HARSH PUNISHMENT IF THE SAME VICTIM SURVIVES SO I'D LIKE TO GIVE YOU A REAL LIFE EXAMPLE A CASE THAT IS. IN FACT IN THE COURTS A VERY YOUNG WOMAN WENT ALONG WITH A WOMAN FRIEND IN A MANNER TO PAINT GRAFFITI- WHEN PEOPLE TRIED TO STOP HER FROM TAGGING A BUILDING. THE MAN GOT OUT OF THE CAR THEY THEY WERE IN AND SHOT TWO PEOPLE. ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE DIED THE OTHER SURVIVED. THE YOUNG WOMAN. WITH THE DOING THE GRAFFITI DID NOT INTEND FOR EITHER VICTIM TO BE SHOT. MUCH LESS KILLED AND UNDER IT SB FOURTEEN THIRTY SEVEN SHE CAN NO LONGER BE CONVICTED OF THE MURDER OF THE ONE WHO DIED. BUT THE- TRIAL COURT SAID TAT AS TO THE VICTIM WHO SURVIVED SHE WAS PROPERLY CONVICTED OF ATTEMPTED MURDER. AND THE COURT OF APPEAL- CONFIRM THIS- AND THAT SHE CAN SPEND DECADES IN PRISON AS A RESULT SB SEVEN SEVEN FIVE CLARIFIES WHAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN OBVIOUS AT DEFENDANT SHOULD NOT BE IN A WORSE POSITION BECAUSE THE SHOOTER'S VICTIMS SURVIVE- THE OTHER POINT- IT IS SENATOR TOUCHED ON MANY MINOR PARTICIPANTS IN CRIMES. THE WENT BAD WERE ALLOWED TO PLEAD GUILTY TO MANSLAUGHTER IN ORDER TO AVOID BEING PROSECUTED FOR A MURDER THEY DIDN'T COMMIT. IF HE HAD PLED GUILTY TO MURDER. WRITTEN CURRENT VERSION OF SB FOURTEEN THIRTY SEVEN THEY'D BE ALLOWED TO FILE A PETITION TO GET THAT CONVICTION SET ASIDE BUT BECAUSE THEY PLAYED TO A LESSER CRIME. OF MANSLAUGHTER THEY CAN'T FILE A PETITION AND THEY'RE PUNISHED FOR THE KILLING. EXCUSE ME AND OFTEN- AS A SENATOR INDICATED THESE ARE- THE LEAST CULPABLE CULPABLE PEOPLE INVOLVED IN THE CASE- THAT'S ANOTHER INJUSTICE THE- SENATE BILL SEVEN SEVEN FIVE WILL REMEDY AND- OF. WE URGE YOU TO PASS IT. AND IT HAS AMY BE ERA BOARD MEMBER OF THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION AND A LIFETIME PUBLIC DEFENDER. THANK YOU FOR WIDELY PASSING SENATORS SCANNERS SB FOURTEEN THIRTY SEVEN BUILT IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT ARE NEEDLESSLY SERVING LENGTHY PRISON TERMS WHEN THEY WERE NOT THE KILLER AND DID NOT SHARE INTENT TO KILL THE DECEASED. SINCE TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE COURTS HAS CHOSEN TO STRICTLY INTERPRET FOURTEEN THIRTY SEVEN TO LEAVE THE LEAST CULPABLE PEOPLE IN PRISON. WHILE FOURTEEN THIRTY SEVEN DESCRIBED PEOPLE WHO SETTLED THEIR CASES WHAT THEY WERE FACING A FELONY MURDER OR NATURAL AND PROBABLE CONSEQUENCES PROSECUTION. IT DID NOT SPECIFICALLY STATE BOTH LESS CULPABLE PEOPLE WERE ELIGIBLE FOR RESENTENCING THE COURT'S RULINGS. MEAN THAT. HAVE BEEN THAT THE LEGISLATURE MEANT TO INCLUDE. THE LEGISLATURE WHAT IT SETS OUT MORE CLEARLY SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR WERE ASKING FOR IT I JUST CLARIFICATION BILL TO MAKE A FEW SMALL FIXES TO FOURTEEN THIRTY SEVEN TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT THOSE WHO WERE CONVICTED OF LESSER INCLUDED MANSLAUGHTER CHARGES ARE ELIGIBLE FOR RESENTENCING. ALSO FOURTEEN THIRTY SEVEN NARROWED HOMICIDE LAW RELATED TO NATURAL PROBABLE CONSEQUENCES AND YET THE COURTS HAVE DECIDED THOSE CHANGES IN THE HOMICIDE LIFE DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE ALREADY CONVICTED OF ATTEMPTED MURDER. SO WE NEED TO SPELL IT OUT CLEARLY THAT THESE LAST COUPLE PEOPLE READ THE VICTIM DID NOT DIE ARE ALSO ELIGIBLE FOR RESENTENCING JUST LIKE THE MORE SERIOUS HOMICIDE CASES. SB SEVEN SEVEN FIVE ALSO CLARIFIED WITH STRONGER LANGUAGE THAT A PERSON HAS A RIGHT TO A FULL HEARING OF THEIR PETITION WITH COUNSEL APPOINTED TO REPRESENT THEM IN THOSE INITIAL HEARINGS. NO SHORT CUTS THAT YOU KNOW AVOID COUNCIL BEING APPOINTED. WE PUBLIC DEFENDERS ARE READY AND WAITING PLEASE IT IS NOT CONNECTIONS CASES. AND THESE FEW SMALL CHANGES WILL LEAD TO HUGE BENEFITS FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS NOT JUST A HUNDRED TWO PETITIONS WERE DENIED BY THE COURTS OR THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG. BUT THE THOUSANDS WHO DID NOT YET APPLY FOR A POSITION BASED ON THE COURTS ARE RUNNING ITS RULINGS AND ALSO THE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHO NEED TO CLEAN UP THEIR RECORDS TO HELP THEM REINTEGRATE SUCCESSFULLY WITH SOCIETY AND THEIR FAMILIES. SB SEVEN SEVEN FIVE WILL BOOST RACIAL JUSTICE REFORMS NATURAL PROBABLE CONSEQUENCES AND FELONY MURDER THEORIES WERE USED DISPROPORTIONATELY PROSECUTE TO GROUPS OF BLACK. LET'S NOT NEXT AND AGING YOU AND WE'RE ALSO DISPROPORTIONATELY USED AGAINST WOMEN WHO ARE OFTEN LOVED ONES WRAPPED UP. INTO THE CRIME OF ANOTHER PERSON. THE FUNDING FAIRNESS OUR COULD LEGAL. WILL BE. OUR RESULT. BECAUSE WHAT IMPROVE EQUAL. NOT LEAVING OUT THE LESS CULPABLE PEOPLE DUE PROCESS AND MORE DEEPER SERRATION- BY ALLOWING A FAIR APPLICATION OF FOURTEEN THIRTY SEVEN TWO ARE LESS CULPABLE PEOPLE. CURRENTLY THOSE PEOPLE% WHO SETTLED EARLY IN THEIR CASE AND ACCEPTED RESPONSIBILITY HAVE BEEN LEFT OUT IN THE COLD WITHOUT THE RIGHT TO PETITION WELL THE BOLD PEOPLE WHO WENT TO TRIAL AND LYFT HAVE BEEN RESENTENCED AND RELEASED. ALL CALIFORNIANS WILL SEE A BUDGET SAVINGS OF AROUND EIGHTY ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS PER YEAR PER PERSON HIS RELEASED ACCORDING TO THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE MATH. I WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT WE'VE SEEN A LOT OF NEEDLESS BECAUSE OF THE DEATHS IN THE LAST YEAR WE'VE WITNESSED DEATH PENALTY BY NEGLECT. ACCORDING TO CDC OURS NUMBERS WE HAD TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY DEATHS OF INCARCERATED PEOPLE AND TWENTY SIX STAFF MEMBER DEATHS THAT'S TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY SIX LOST LIVES DUE TO NEGLECT DID YOU WRAP UP NOW CDA. YOUR CERTAINLY CITY A IS WRITTEN IN. THAT MURDER WILL NOT HELD AT. THAT AS FALSE THE KILLERS ARE NOT ELIGIBLE UNDER FOURTEEN THIRTY SEVEN AND NOT ELIGIBLE UNDER SEVEN SEVEN FIVE. AND THE PROSECUTORS THEY REACH THE SETTLEMENTS FOR MANSLAUGHTER LEICESTER'S ARE NOW TRYING TO DECIDE THAT THE DEFENDANTS THAT ARE LESS CULPABLE SHOULD STAY IN JAIL. NOW OBVIOUSLY THIS VIOLATE ALL CONTENTS OF FAIRNESS DUE PROCESS AND EQUAL PROTECTION THANK YOU SENATOR BAKER. THANK YOU.

THANK YOU CHAIR SAWYER JONES JOINS JONES SAWYER APOLOGIZE AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS LAURIE HOUGH I AM A PROSECUTOR WITH THE SAN DIEGO DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE. AND I AM TESTIFYING ON BEHALF OF OUR DISTRICT ATTORNEY SUMMER STEPHAN OVER THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY MEMBERS OF OUR SAN DIEGO DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S. ASSOCIATION AND THE SAN DIEGANS AGAINST CRIME OUR DISTRICT ATTORNEY CONTINUES TO PUT FORTH AN SUPPORT SMART REASONABLE REFORM EFFORTS WITHOUT SACRIFICING THE RIGHTS OF VICTIMS. AND TO THAT END WE REMAIN AVAILABLE READY AND WILLING TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THESE IMPORTANT ISSUES WHICH YOU. SENATE BILL SEVEN SEVEN FIVE WILL FURTHER EXPAND THE ELIMINATION OF CRIMINAL LIABILITY FOR THOSE CONVICTED OF ATTEMPTED MURDER UNDER A NATURAL AND PROBABLE CONSEQUENCES DOCTRINE AND MANSLAUGHTER UNDER EITHER A FELONY MURDER THEORY. OR UNDER THE NATURAL AND PROBABLE CONSEQUENCES DOCTRINES. IT IS SIMPLY THE RESULT OF THIS BILL WILL BE EXTENSIVE RE LITIGATION OF ALREADY RESOLVED CASES AND IT WILL INEVITABLY TRAMPLE ON VICTIMS RIGHT. PLEASE UNDERSTAND THAT WITH THE PASSAGE OF THIS BILL VICTIMS AND THEIR FAMILIES WILL BE NOTIFIED THAT THEIR CASES ARE NOT OVER. BUT THEY WILL BE FORCED TO COME BACK TO COURT FOR ADDITIONAL HEARINGS AND THAT THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS KILLER OR THE PERSON WHO ATTEMPTED TO KILL THEM. MAY GET OUT OF PRISON AND THE AGREED UPON SENTENCE OR THE SENTENCE DETERMINED BY A JUDGE BASED ON THE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES OF THAT PARTICULAR CASE. IS NO LONGER VALID THIS FLIES IN THE FACE OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS AFFORDED TO ALL VICTIMS BUT ESPECIALLY TO VICTIMS OF VIOLENT CRIME. IT WILL ALSO BE PROBLEMATIC TO SAY THE LEAST TO DETERMINE WHO IS ELIGIBLE FOR RELEASE. YOU SEE MANY ATTEMPTED MURDERS FOR EXAMPLE ARE DONE BY CHANGE OF PLEA. AND THERE'S NO WAY TO TELL ON A CHANGE OF PLEA FORM WHETHER AS A MATTER OF LAW THE ATTEMPTED MURDER WAS COMMITTEDUNDER AND AIDING AND ABETTING TERRY. OR UNNATURAL PROBABLE CONSEQUENCES. THIS WILL REQUIRE FURTHER LITIGATION. IN ORDER FOR THE PEOPLE TO TRACK DOWN AND SUBPOENA VICTIMS AND WITNESSES SOMETIMES YEARS LATER. IN ORDER TO PROVE WHAT THE DEFENDANT PLED TO IN THE FIRST PLACE FOR MANSLAUGHTER CONVICTIONS KEEP IN MIND THAT THESE ARE LESSER. CRIMES OF MURDER THAT DO NOT REQUIRE MALICE. IN OTHER WORDS WHEN A JURY CONVICTS SOMEONE OF MANSLAUGHTER OR A DEFENDANT PLEADS GUILTY TO MANSLAUGHTER WE ARE ALREADY. ACKNOWLEDGING THEIR REDUCED PARTICIPATION IN A KILLING OR MALICE IS NEGATED AND THE DEFENDANT IS SENTENCED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THEIR REDUCED LEVEL OF INVOLVEMENT. AGAIN IN A MANSLAUGHTER CHANGE OF PLEA FORM THERE IS OFTEN NO WAY TO TELL IF THE UNDERLYING THEORY WAS A NATURAL AND PROBABLE CONSEQUENCES FELONY MURDER OR EATING AND ABETTING JERRY. FINALLY THE SENTENCING. FOR VOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER AND ATTEMPTED MURDER. ARE ALREADY SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED. VOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER IT THAT LESSER FORM OF MURDER WHERE THERE IS NO MALICE. HAS A SENTENCING TRY OUT OF THREE SIX OR ELEVEN YEARS AND ATTEMPTED MURDER HAS A SENTENCING TRIAL OUT OF FIVE SEVEN OR NINE YEARS. BOTH ARE DETERMINANT NONLIFE TERMS. SO ANY RELIEF PROVIDED TWO ATTEMPTED MURDERS AND MANSLAUGHTER UNDER S. B. SEVEN SEVEN FIVE WILL RESULT IN THEIR IMMEDIATE RELEASE. BACK INTO THE SAME COMMUNITIES WITH THEIR VICTIMS AND WITHOUT ANY MANDATORY SUPERVISION PERIOD. THIS DOES NOT SERVE WHAT SHOULD BE ALL OF OUR STATED GOALS OF KEEPING OUR COMMUNITY SAFE AND PROTECTING VICTIMS OF CRIME. WE ARE MORE THAN CONCERNED THAT THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF THIS BILL FALLS SQUARELY ON VICTIMS IN THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICES ACROSS THE STATE THAT WILL HAVE TO PROVE. AFTER THE FACT IT WHAT HAS ALREADY BEEN PLAYED TO OR PRESENT TO A JURY. WE WILL BE RE TRAUMATIZING OUR MOST VULNERABLE AND A ROUTING VICTIMS TRUST AND CONFIDENCE IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. WE ASK FOR YOUR NO VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. NOW GO TO ROOM ARE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION OF- SB SEVEN SEVEN FIVE. C. NONE WILL GO TO THE- TELECONFERENCE FROM ERNIE WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. C.

THREE FOUR WILL PRIVATE FOR PRISONS AND DETENTION FACILITIES TO DO ONE AND HERE TO ALL APPROPRIATE STATE AND LOCAL HEALTH SAFETY FIRE AND JAIL STANDARDS TO MAINTAIN COMPREHENSIVE INSURANCE COVERAGE INCLUDING GENERAL LIABILITY AUTOMOBILE WORKERS COMP AN UMBRELLA LIABILITY. THREE REQUIRED DETENTION FACILITIES TO SUBMIT ANNUAL COMPLIANCE REPORTS TO BOTH INSURANCE PROVIDER- AND THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE. AND FOURTH IS TO REQUIRE INSURANCE COMPANIES PROVIDING COVERAGE TO DETENTION FACILITIES. BE AN ADMITTED INSURER RECOGNIZED BY THE STATE. THERE ARE NOW SEVERAL PRIVATE FOR PROFIT AND DETENTION FACILITIES IN CALIFORNIA INCLUDING SIX MAJOR CIVIL DETENTION FACILITIES. THE FOR PROFIT DETENTION FACILITIES HAVE A LONG HISTORY OF POOR CONDITIONS AND ABUSIVE TREATMENT IN VARIOUS FORMS INCLUDING CASES OF PHYSICAL ABUSE SEXUAL ASSAULT AND PSYCHOLOGICAL TORTURE. THERE ARE NUMEROUS REPORTS DETAILING ABUSE OF TREATMENT INCLUDING A TWENTY SEVENTEEN US DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY REPORT FINDING THAT THE ADELANTO DETENTION FACILITY FAILED TO MEET MANY OF THE GOVERNMENT'S OWN STANDARDS. AND THE OPERATORS DID NOT ADDRESS THE PROBLEMS DESPITE REPEATED WARNINGS. IN FACT THERE ARE REPORTS DURING THE CALL BUT NINETEEN PANDEMIC INCLUDED ACCOUNTS OF NOT HAVING ACCESS TO SANITATION AND PP RESOURCES. THE PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL APPLY EQUALLY TO FOR PROFIT FACILITIES ENGAGE IN CIVIL DETENTION AND CRIMINAL DETENTION BECAUSE WE EXPECT ALL FACILITIES OPERATING IN THE STATE TO ADHERE TO THE SAME STANDARDS AND GUIDELINES- WITH ME THE- IN SUPPORT AND ANSWER TECHNICAL QUESTIONS. I HAVE MICHAEL MARTINEZ LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE OFFICE OF INSURANCE COMMISSIONER RICARDO LARA AND ALSO SAYS A TESTIFIED IN SUPPORT ABIGAIL- BUT AS THE SUMMER LEGISLATIVE FELLOW FOR THE CALIFORNIA IMMIGRANT POLICY CENTER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU- FROM THE BOTTOM UP MISTER MARTINEZ- MISS ALVAREZ WHOEVER WANTS BEGIN FIRST YOU HAVE FIVE MINUTES TOTAL. GREAT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. GOOD MORNING CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MICHAEL MARTINEZ HERE ON BEHALF OF INSURANCE COMMISSIONER RICARDO LARA AND THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE. COMMISSIONER LOT IS VERY PROUD TO CO SPONSOR SENATE BILL THREE THREE FOUR AND WE THANK SENATOR ALSO FOR HER LEADERSHIP IN OFFERING THIS MEASURE. AS THE AUTHOR JUST MENTIONS IS WELL DOCUMENTED BY FEDERAL AND STATE AUTHORITIES NEWS REPORTS AND EVEN CALIFORNIA'S. STATE AUDITOR THAT THESE FOR PROFIT PRIVATE PRISONS AND DETENTION FACILITIES HAVE VIOLATED AND CONTINUE TO DISREGARD EXISTING HEALTH SAFETY JAIL LABOR AND CARE STANDARDS. FOR DETAINEES IN THEIR CUSTODY STANDARDS ARE CURRENTLY FOLLOWED BY CALIFORNIA'S OWN STATE AND LOCAL PUBLICLY MANAGE PRISONS LOCAL JAILS AND DETENTION FACILITIES TODAY. THIS BILL OFFERS A CRITICAL PIECE TO THE NEEDED OVERSIGHT OF THE FOR PROFIT PRIVATE PRISONS AND DETENTION FACILITIES BY EXPRESSLY MANDATING. THESE FACILITIES MEET THE STRINGENT STANDARDS AS WELL AS MAINTAIN BASIC INSURANCE COVERAGES FOR LIABILITY AND WORKERS COMPENSATION OBTAINED BY THE ADMITTED MARKET. WE BELIEVE THAT MANDATING BE CERTAIN INSURANCE COVERAGES ON THESE PERSONS AND FACILITIES IN ORDER TO PROTECT THE TEN PERSON PER PERSON SEND WORKING PERSONNEL. AS WELL AS REQUIRING THESE PRISONS AND FACILITIES TO SEND PERIODIC REPORTS ON THEM COMPLYING WITH THE STANDARDS TO BOTH THEIR INSURANCE COMPANY AND THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE. WILL CREATE A STRONGER FINANCIAL INCENTIVE FOR THESEPRESENTS AND FACILITIES TO ADHERE TO THESE PROP PUBLIC SAFETY STANDARDS. WE BELIEVE IN SENATE BILL THREE THREE FOUR IS A REASONABLE WAY TO FURTHER REGULATE FOR PROFIT PRIVATE PRISONS AND DETENTION FACILITIES IN OUR STATE. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY ENSURE THAT BASIC HEALTH SAFETY AND HUMAN RIGHTS ARE AFFORDED TO OUR MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS DETAINED IN OUR STATE. THANK YOU I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE ON THIS MEASURE. THANK YOU.

ACCORDING TO I WAS VERY OWN CULVERT NINETEEN TRACKER AT THE JULY EIGHTH ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND FOUR PEOPLE HAVE TESTED POSITIVE FOR COKE AT NINETEEN AND CALIFORNIA SEVEN IMMIGRATION DETENTION CENTER.

OF THE REST OF THE MEMBERS ARE ON THE WAY BUT WE ARE RESPECT FOR YOUR TIME. WE CAN BEGIN. THANK YOU. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I APPRECIATE VERY MUCH. WORKING ON THIS ISSUE SINCE TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN WITH THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION. WE SEE VARIOUS ITERATIONS OF THIS DISCUSSION IN CALIFORNIA AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY. I'M HERE TODAY BECAUSE ON MARCH TWENTY FIFTH TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE. THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN THE UNANIMOUS DECISION. HELD THAT THE COMMON PRACTICE OF CONDITIONING FREEDOM SOLELY ON WHETHER THE ARRESTEE CAN'T AFFORD BAIL. IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL PERIOD OF CASE ALL OF THE DISCUSSIONS IN ALL OF THE DEBATES ABOUT WHETHER ONE THING SHOULD BE ONE WAY OR THE OTHER. IS OVER THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT MADE THAT DETERMINATION AND THAT IS THE LAW OF OUR LAND AND THE COURTS MUST CONSIDER. THE ABILITY OF THE ARRESTEES TO PAY THAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE SO THE DISCUSSIONS THAT WE HAVE ENGAGED IN OVER THE YEARS. THE VARIOUS ITERATIONS INITIALLY IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN COPPING THE FEDERAL SYSTEM TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WOULD NOW TURN THE GENERAL BONTA AND MYSELF IN THOSE COUPLE OF YEARS OF DISCUSSIONS. ARE SUBSTANTIALLY DIFFERENT. THE. THE COURT HELD BASICALLY IF YOU READ THE CASE ALMOST VERBATIM WHAT. THEY WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT OVER THE YEARS BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE AND IN THESE DISCUSSIONS- WE TALKED ABOUT THE DISADVANTAGED. TO CARS RATED IN TERMS OF THEIR LIVES AND THEIR FAMILIES THE COURT TALKS ABOUT THE- FORCING THE STATE TO BEAR COSTS THAT WERE EXTRAORDINARY WHEN THERE WAS NO NEED TO BEAR THOSE COSTS BECAUSE THERE WASN'T FLIGHT RISK. OR PUBLIC SAFETY RISK YOU TALKED ABOUT THE UNFAIR IMPACT ON BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES AND PEOPLE WITHOUT MEANS. COURT INDICATED THAT THE PURPOSE OF BAIL IS NOT TO PUNISH IT IS THREE PURPOSES THREE PURPOSES WHICH INFORM THE CONSTITUTIONAL BASIS. FIRST TO ENSURE THE PEOPLE APPEAR IN THE SIMPLEST TERMS THE PEOPLE APPEAR IN COURT THE OLD RULE. YOU HEARD ME SAY WHEN MY DAD WAS AN OLD JAILHOUSE LAWYER BECAUSE JEWS COULDN'T GET LAWYER GETTING JOBS L. A. COUNTY. IN IN- THE FORTIES. HE WORKED IN IN BETTER PRESENTED FOLKS FROM JAIL AND SOMEBODY WOULD COME IN AND GIVE A HUNDRED DOLLARS TO THE BAILIFF AND THEY MADE SURE TO THE CLERK OF THE COURT. THEY MADE SURE THEY GOT THE HARD DOLLARS BACK- THE SECOND WAS TO PROTECT VICTIMS OF THE THIRD IS TO PROTECT PUBLIC SAFETY. THE COURT FOUND THAT THE- SYSTEM IS CURRENTLY CONSTITUTED IN CALIFORNIA. IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL. NO WHAT HAPPENED ALONG THE WAY THE FORM IF YOU WILL IS JUST ONCE WHEN ATTORNEY GENERAL BONTA NIGHT NOW ATTORNEY GENERAL BONSAI CARRIED LEGISLATION. WHICH BECAME S. B. TEN. ARE WE HELD UP IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN TO BE INFORMED THIS IMPORTANT I THINK CONTEXTUALLY BECAUSE IT. EVERY STEP OF THE WAY WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO COORDINATE WITH THE COURTS. THE ARGUMENTS THAT ARE MADE BY THE SIDES OR ITS UNCONSTITUTIONAL OR WHATEVER THE CASE MAY BE WE TRIED IN EVERY INSTANCE TO HARMONIZE OURSELVES AND SOMETIMES TO A- AN OX PLAIN THAT THE MINUTE. WITH THE COURTS. INTO OCTOBER TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN. A COMMITTEE APPOINTED BY THE CHIEF JUSTICE WROTE THIS REPORT PRE TRIAL DETENTION REFORM RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE CHIEF JUSTICE. WE HELD UP OUR BILL WE BASICALLY INFORMED SP TEN AROUND THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE COURTS. WHY DO WE DO THAT WE FELT IF THE CHIEF JUSTICE IN THE JUDGES FROM ALL DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FELT THAT THIS WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS CONSTITUTIONAL WE'RE PROBABLY A PRETTY SOLID GROUND. WHAT THEY DIDN'T QUITE AMAZING TO ME WHICH I REALLY WAS QUITE SURPRISED BY. IS THEY CAME UP WITH THE CONSTITUTIONAL THEORY THAT SAYS. NO BAIL YOU COULD HAVE AN APPROPRIATE PRE TRIAL DETENTION SYSTEM THE TO HAS BASICALLY ELIMINATES BAIL AS LONG AS YOU HAD A SYSTEMIC PROCESS IN PLACE THAT'S A SYSTEMIC PROCESS WAS THE FORM THE FOUNDATION OF S. B. TEN HAD TO DO WITH THESE ASSESSMENT TOOLS THESE ALGORITHMS FORTY SEVEN COUNTIES CURRENTLY CONTINUE TO USE THEM BUT THIS IDEA WAS THESE ALGORITHMS THAT WE'RE GOING TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT SOMEBODY. WOULD APPEAR WHETHER THEY WERE FOR THE REST OF THOSE ALGORITHMS PROVED TO HAVE SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES. FOR COMMUNITIES TO OVER POLICED AND OFTEN WERE CRITICIZED IN THE LATER YEARS NOT IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN. WHERE THEY WERE SUPPORTED BUT WERE ULTIMATELY CRITICIZES TOOLS OF PREJUDICE AND- DIDN'T REALLY GET TO THE ISSUE OF JUSTICE. AND SO WHEN THIS MEASURE WAS PASSED AND SB TELLING THE GOVERNOR SIGNED IT. IN BOTH HOUSES THE BAIL INDUSTRY SPENT MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO REFERENDA THE MEASURE. BUT THE REFERENDUM WASN'T BASED UPON THE ARGUMENTS THAT WERE APPEARED THIS COMMITTEE IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN ABOUT PUBLIC SAFETY. THOSE ARGUMENTS WARNED ABOUT. AT THE ISSUE OF THE BILL AGENTS BEING REAL COPS IN GOING OUT AND SAVING MONEY BECAUSE THEY WERE CHASING DOWN BUT WHAT'S THE DOG THE BOUNTY HUNTER CAME AND TESTIFIED BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE IT WAS CHASING FOLKS DOWN. IN SAVING FOLKS MONEY NO THEY HAD TO PUT THE HEAD OF THE N. DOUBLE ACP. THE TALKED ABOUT THE UNFAIRNESS OF THESE RISK ASSESSMENT TOOLS. THAT THE ELIMINATION OF BAIL. WAS BIAS. THAT THESE WERE. BLACK BOXES HOT IS WHAT SHE SAID IN THE COMMERCIAL JUST WATCH IT AGAIN THIS MORNING. IT'S A WITH THE VOTERS VOTED ON. SB TEN WHICH WAS PROP TWENTY FIVE AT THE END OF THE BALLOT. THEY VOTED ON THE NOT WHETHER OR NOT THEY BALK THE CURRENT BILL SYSTEM WAS FAIR OR NOT DID IT PRODUCE THE OUTCOME BEST THE RESULTS ARE NOT. THEY VOTED ON THE SYSTEM OF ALGORITHMS TO REPLACE BAIL. FAIR CALL WHAT HAVE WE DONE IN THIS BILL. WE'VE TAKEN THE FOUNDATION OF HUMPHRIES CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT. WE HAVE YOU HAD BEFORE YOU SENATOR- SOMEWHERE BONTA THE IN HIS BODY AT THE EXACT SAME BILL EXCEPT FOR TWO CHANGES WE ADDED ALL THE LANGUAGE OF HUMPHRIES INTO THE VERSION YOU HAVE BEFORE YOU NOW BECAUSE WE WANTED TO INCORPORATE THAT THINKING STATUTORILY INTO THE BILL. AND WE HAD SOME OTHER PROVISIONS THAT WILL TALK ABOUT IN A MINUTE THAT THAT- SOME OTHER GROUPS WANTED US TO INCLUDE. SO YOU HAVE BEFORE YOU NOW THE BLUEPRINT. OF HOW DO YOU TAKE THE SUPREME COURT'S DECISION. IN MAY NINETEEN FIFTY FOUR IN BROWN VERSUS BOARD OF EDUCATION UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT SAYS SEPARATE BUT EQUAL WAS UNCONSTITUTIONAL BUT DIDN'T TELL FOLKS HOW TO GET TO SEPARATE BUT EQUAL TO JUST SAID IT'S UNCONSTITUTIONAL SET FORTH THE CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLE. THAT WAS CRITICAL TO WHO WE ARE AS A PEOPLE. THIS COURT DID THE SAME THING WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE. WE ARE SETTING FORTH A BLUEPRINT. IN MOST INSTANCES NOT INCOMPLETE WOULDN'T TOUCH EVERYTHING THEY DID BUT THE CORE ISSUE OF THE ABILITY TO PAY. AND WE SET FORTH A BLUEPRINT NOW HOW DO WE MAKE THAT BLUEPRINT. WE DIDN'T WANT TO GET OUT THERE AND DO SOMETHING THAT WE'RE COMING UP WITH A BUNCH OF CRAZY IDEAS. WE DID THE SAME THING WE DID BEFORE WE COPY THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL. NOW WHO'S THE REGIONAL COUNCIL YOUR COUNCIL HEADED BY THE CHIEF JUSTICE OF CALIFORNIA'S REPORT IT IS THE BODY THAT. ACTUALLY IS YOU MINISTRY TO BODY FOR THE COURT SYSTEM FOR THE THIRD BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT. WE TOOK THE IDEA THAT THEY USE ZERO BAIL. DURING THE- PANDEMIC. AND WE JUST USE THEIR SAME STANDARDS THE ONLY THING WITH A DIFFERENT. AFTER DISCUSSING THIS WITH A FEW FOLKS WE CHANGE SOME OF THE EXCLUSIONS THAT THEY HAD IN THE VERY DOT LAW THAT WE CREATED BECAUSE WE GET. DIDN'T WANT TO GET OUT THERE ON A LIMB WE DIDN'T WANT TO GET OUT THERE AND BE STUPID. AND TELL EVERYBODY BEAT US UP AND SAY HERTZBERG YOUR INVENTION THAT THIS WORLD IT DOESN'T WORK WE WANT TO SHOW SOMETHING THAT WORKED. WE ADDED A FEW PROVISIONS WE SAID. AND IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OPPOSITION TALKS ABOUT THESE THINGS WHICH WE'VE ALREADY TAKEN OUT SO. IT A WEATHER UPDATE WE SAID THE VIOLATION OF A HATE CRIME IS EXCLUDED. WE SAID HUMAN TRAFFICKERS EXCLUDED ELDER ABUSE CHILD ABUSE ASSAULTS. WITH THE FORCE SHOULD LIKELY BECAUSE OF BODILY INJURY AND ALSO THE DA'S TALKED ABOUT ANOTHER ISSUE THEY COMPLAINED ABOUT THAT WE HAD OUT IN THE EARLY VERSION. WHICH WAS- KAREN WITH IT WAS- THAT WAS ANOTHER ISSUE I THINK- WITNESS INTIMIDATION THAT WAS IT WAS ALREADY OUT SO WE DEALT WITH THAT SECONDLY SOME OTHER FOLKS TALKED ABOUT AND WE THOUGHT IT WAS APPROPRIATE. TO MODIFY WHAT THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL DID. WAS THIS WHOLE IDEA THE REVOLVING DOOR. WHAT HAPPENS IN THE CASE WHERE SOMEBODY HAS A SMALL PETTY CRIME. THEY GET ARRESTED THEY GET RELEASED AND A WEEK LATER THEY DO IT AGAIN. DO YOU JUST LET HIM GO. SO WE PUT IN A PROVISION IN THE MODIFICATIONS THAT'S THE SECOND THING WE DO THAT'S DIFFERENT THAN WHAT BONTA HAD BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE. THAT SAID- NO REVOLVING DOOR IF YOU HAVE A FIRST TIME OUT YOU'RE YOU'RE OUT THERE AND YOU YOU GET RELEASED A SECOND TIME YOU GOTTA GO TO THE PROCESS THE PROCESS IS COURT LOOKS AT YOUR ABILITY TO PAY IS A LEAST RESTRICTIVE FACTOR AND THE FACTORS THAT WERE SET FORTH. IN THE COURT- SO LOOK YOU KNOW. WE'RE TRYING. THE OTHER ARGUMENT THAT WAS MADE I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT IN THE ASSEMBLY VERSUS DUKE MAGING CASE THAT SET STANDARDS AS TO WHAT THE RULES SHOULD BE BETWEEN WHEN SOMETHING IS REFERENDUM AND WHETHER OR NOT YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO DISCUSS IT AGAIN YOU CAN'T DO THE EXACT SAME THING WE'RE NOT DOING THE EXACT SAME THING THE LAST BILL ELIMINATED BAIL AND SET UP A STANDARD OF ALGORITHMS TO DO THE STANDARD THIS. ALLOWS FOR BAIL IT CREATES A STATE WIDE STANDARD WHY DO WE HAVE STATEWIDE STANDARDS BECAUSE IF YOU GET BUSTED IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA THINK IT'S IN THE HUMBOLDT COUNTY FOR A CRIME YOU GET BUSTED IN SAN DIEGO IT'S FIVE TIMES BIGGER IN SAN DIEGO FOR THE SAME CRIME THAT SHOULDN'T BE THE CASE THOSE STANDARDS SHOULD BE SET BY THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL ACROSS THE STATE IN FACT. WHAT YOU'LL FIND IN THE OPPOSITION LETTER WHICH IS OPPOSITE OF WHAT YOU FOUND IN THIS BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE BEFORE WAS A BILL MYSTERIES ARGUING WELL LOCAL JURISDICTION LOCAL HAVE CONTROL ASSEMBLY- COOPER HAD A BILL OF STATEWIDE- MEASURE THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BUY THESE WROTE. WHAT I FOUND IN THIS FIVE SIX YEAR ENDEAVOR IS THAT AND I SEE THIS WE'LL SEE THIS IN OUR LIVES WE SEE THIS IN OUR BILLS BEFORE THIS THIS LEGISLATURE IS WHEN SOMEBODY WANTS TO OPPOSE SOMETHING THEY'LL THROW ANYTHING ON THE WALL AND SEE WHAT STICKS WITH THE COPS WE'RE SAVING MONEY WE'RE THIS WE'RE THAT IT'S UNFAIR IT'S THIS IT'S WHATEVER THE REALITY IS THE CURRENT SYSTEM IS UNBELIEVABLY UNFAIR TO FOLKS IT DOESN'T WORK IT DOESN'T SOLVE THE PROBLEM WE CAN GO THROUGH KENTUCKY WE GO THROUGH THE JERSEY. WE GO TO NEW YORK WE CAN GO TO A NUMBER OF OTHER STATES OTHERS COUNTIES HERE IN CALIFORNIA WHERE THERE HAS BEEN THESE ALTERNATIVES. TO THE WORKED REASONABLY WELL. WHAT WE LOOK TO. THE PEOPLE CAN OTHER WHEN THERE ARE. AND DO THEY- NEED THEY SHOW UP IN COURT BECAUSE THAT'S THE PURPOSE OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO AND THEY DO. YOU DON'T HAVE TO TEAR SOMEONE'S LIFE APART YOU DON'T HAVE TO RUIN THEIR LIVES YOU CAN ACHIEVE THE UNDERLYING ARCHITECTURE AND OBJECTIVES THAT YOU NEED TO ACHIEVE. IN THIS IS JUST AND FAIR SOCIETY WITHOUT INSTITUTIONAL RACISM WHICH IS WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE. YEAH I UNDERSTAND THE INDUSTRY DOESN'T LIKE IT I SUSPECT THE BLOCKBUSTER PEOPLE WERE VERY HAPPY. WE WENT TO CD'S INSTEAD OF DVDS WHATEVER WAS. WHATEVER THOSE THESE VHS IS I SUSPECT THAT THAT. ALL KINDS OF INDUSTRIES DIDN'T LIKE IT WELCOME TO THE CLUB. THE INDUSTRY WAS CREATED. OUT OF A COMPLETELY DEAD OF CIRCUMSTANCES WHAT AREA HERTZBERG TRYING CASES THERE WERE NO BIG BAIL INDUSTRY DIDN'T HAPPEN. I HAVE COLDS HERE FROM ONE OF THE CEOS OF THE COMPANY. IS WE HAVE WRITTEN A CHECK IN SEVENTEEN YEARS WHY. BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE TO BECAUSE THEY GO OUT AND THE ARREST THE PERSON. IT'S HORRIBLE. SO COUPLE OF THE PARTS YOU WANT TO MAKE IT ALL ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT PEOPLE. HAVEN'T HEARD OVER THE WITNESSES. THE OTHER P. IS. ABOUT THIS INDUSTRY THAT I'VE LEARNED THROUGH THIS PROCESS IS ENGAGING THESE LEGAL FICTIONS WORDEN SURE A COMPANY WHERE THE HELL THAT IS WE'RE REGULATED BY PROPOSITION ONE OH THREE WE'RE REGULATED BY THIS DO YOU KNOW THAT THAT'S THE CASE RIGHT NOW PENDING IN OAKLAND. WITH THESE FOLKS ARE SAYING THAT THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO CHARGE 10% I LOVE TO DO THAT THE BASE IS GOING TO TRUST CASE I THINK YOU'RE GONNA GET THEY'RE GONNA GET BLOWN UP ON THE CASE. SECONDLY I DON'T OF THE KITCHEN FROM USERS A CASES WHERE THE BREEZE. THEY THINK THAT THEY'RE NOT LIABLE TO CONSUMER PROTECTION STANDARDS. THIS BECOME A PREDATORY LENDING BUSINESS. THEY DON'T OVER THESE RULES DON'T APPLY TO US AND SO WHAT DO WE SAY IN THIS BILL THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT. THAT'S GOT UNDER THEIR SKIN AND I UNDERSTAND WHY. BUT OUR JOB IS TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC IN A WAY. THAT MAKE SURE PEOPLE ARE SAFE THE PEOPLE GET TO COURT. AND THAT LIVES ARE TURNED UPSIDE DOWN. WE SAY IF YOU PAY. YOUR FEE. IT'S NOT. A FORFEITURE. IF A DAY AFTER. IF THE DAY AFTER YOU. ARE RESTED AND YOU PAID FIVE THOUSAND BECAUSE THE SUPREME COURT TALKS ABOUT WHAT THEY SAID IN A PRE TRIAL DETENTION REFORM. AND TALK ABOUT THE CASE. WE'RE FIVE TIMES HIGHER THAN THE PLACE SO SPACE FIVE JEEZ GUESS WHAT YOU'LL GET IT BACK. WHAT WE SAY HERE JUST LIKE A MORTGAGE OR CREDIT CARD. YOU PAID ADMINISTRATIVE FEE AND YOU PAY THE VALUE OF THAT MONEY FOR A PERIOD OF TIME. ARE THEY GOING TO STILL MAKE MONEY OF COURSE THEY ARE THEY GONNA MAKE LESS MONEY YOU'RE RIGHT THEY'RE GONNA LIKE THIS MONEY IS A COULD BE FAIRNESS IN THE PROCESS WORK. THE LAW THAT WE HAVE JUST PROVINCIALLY THAT WE HAVE CREATED IN CALIFORNIA FOR THE LAST SIXTY YEARS IN TERMS OF CONSUMER DEBT. GET SERVING ALL OF THE LAWS THAT WE ENGAGE TO PROTECT PEOPLE ON BUYING A CAR BUYING A HOUSE OR- BUYING CREDIT CARDS DOES APPLY TO THIS INDUSTRY. YOU'RE RIGHT THEY SHOULD. AND SO WE'VE JUST THE BOTTOM LINE OF THIS BILL IS WE HAVE FOUR IN THE INFORMED BY. THE COURTS EVERY STEP OF THE WAY. WE ARE HERE TODAY BECAUSE THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT HAS SPOKEN AND WE ARE TAKING THE NEXT STEPS. WE ARE HERE TODAY INFORMED BY THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL AND INFORMED BY A LEVEL OF COULD JURISPRUDENTIAL THEORY AROUND CONSUMER PROTECTION THAT IS ESSENTIAL TO EVERYTHING THAT WE ARE. AS CALIFORNIANS WE DON'T RIP PEOPLE OFF WE DON'T% ALLOW FOR THESE THINGS TO HAPPEN. SO IN MY PASSION ABOUT THIS YOU'RE RIGHT I AM I'M PASSIONATE ABOUT IT BECAUSE IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO I'M PASSIONATE ABOUT IT BECAUSE EVERY ARGUMENT HAS BEEN THROWN UP ON THE WALL. HIS IS HOCUS POCUS AND I'LL GO THROUGH THE REST OF THEM AS WE GO THROUGH THIS AND I'M PASSIONATE ABOUT IT BECAUSE THE BECAUSE ALL THAT HAVE PARTICIPATED. OUR SUBSTANTIVE PEOPLE THAT HAVE WORKED HARD. AND TRYING TO PROTECT FOLKS WHOSE LIVES HAVE BEEN DESTROYED I HAVE EXAMPLES OF PEOPLE SIT IN JAILS WHICH I CAN GIVE YOU AROUND THE STATE FOR A YEAR TWO YEARS BECAUSE I COULDN'T AFFORD TO PAY. THEIR BAIL THE SEVEN JAIL MAN. I MEAN IS THAT A FAIR WAY TO TREAT THIS AS A SOCIETY WE TALK ABOUT WHO WE ARE HELLO. SO I STAND HERE STRONG SUPPORT WE GOT SOME WITNESSES I HAVEN'T LOOKED IN THE PAPER SO I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY ARE WHAT WE HAVEN'T LOOKED ANYTHING. JUST TALKING OFF THE TOP. OF MY HEAD LIKE IT'S WHAT I USUALLY DO. BUT BUT- WITHOUT BEING SAID HAPPY DANCING AND- LISTEN TO THIS IMPORTANT AND NO THERE'S NO OPPOSITION THIS ANYWAY SO THAT'S OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH MATURE MEMBERS I APPRECIATE YOUR INDULGING MY- PASSION ON THIS ISSUE. THANK YOU CENTER HURTS BURKE- I HAVE A ESTEBAN UNIONS ANTI RECIDIVISM COALITION VIA TELEPHONE. AS A WITNESS IN SUPPORT OF SB TWO SIX TWO. OPERATOR YOU MAY BRING HIM IN. I THANK YOU CARE AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS BETHANY HAS I'M THE DIRECTOR OF ADVOCATES AND COMMUNITY ORGANIZING WITH ANTI RECIDIVISM COALITION ALSO KNOWN AS A. R. C. I'M ERIC HE HAD WORKED TIRELESSLY FOR MANY YEARS NEARLY FIVE NOW TO REFORM CALIFORNIA'S PRE TRIAL SYSTEM BECAUSE WE BELIEVE IN EQUITY FAIRNESS ACCOUNTABILITY AND ECONOMIC JUSTICE. I WOULD LIKE TO SHARE A STORY OF AN ERROR SEE MEMBER WHO SADLY IS UNABLE TO BE WITH US TODAY. RIGHT BEFORE GRAHAM RAN. AND IMPLEMENTED A ZERO BILLS GET YOU'LL FOR PEOPLE BEING CHARGED WITH LOW LEVEL OFFENSES AND A R. C. MEMBERS. WITH SUBSTANCE ABUSE ISSUES WAS ARRESTED AND CHARGED WITH VANDALISM. RATHER THAN RECEIVING THE HELP AND SUPPORT SERVICES HE NEEDED THIS YOUNG MAN RECEIVED A BELL THAT WAS WELL BEYOND IT MAY. BECAUSE YOU CANNOT AFFORD A BAIL HE WAS FORCED TO STAND JAIL AND WAS MURDERED WITHIN A WEEK. THE CONSEQUENCES OF INEQUITABLE BAIL ARE GREAT. NOT ONLY DO THEY- NOT ONLY DOES COUNTY JAIL RISK HUMAN LIVES IT TRAUMATIZED IS AN EXACERBATING UNDERLYING TRAUMAS AND CONDITIONS FURTHERMORE IT COST CALIFORNIA FOUR POINT FIVE SIX MILLION DOLLARS A DAY TO KEEP ROUGHLY FORTY THOUSAND PEOPLE LOCKED UP IN COUNTY JAIL. THE PRETRIAL JUSTICE INSTITUTE REPORTS THAT THE COSTS OF SUPERVISING A PERSON AND THE COMMUNITY WHILE SPENDING WHILE PENDING TRIAL IS AOUT 10% OF THE COST OF KEEPING THEM IN JAIL. THE PRIME ELIGIBLE FOR ZERO DOLLARS BAIL UNDER THAT FILL OUR LOW LEVEL OFFENSES CRIMES OF DESPERATION AND OUTCRY IF YOU WILL THEY ARE NOT CRIMES THAT SIGNAL A FUTURE LIFE OF CRIME OR DANGER TO OUR SOCIETY. BUT ONE THAT SIGNAL SOMEONE. BASIC NEEDS ARE NOT BEING MET. HOW DID YOUR IS NOT THE SOLUTION FOR THE VENDOR. IT'S NOT A THAT HE- REHABILITATE ARE RACE COUNTY JAIL AS PLACE YOUR COULD STRIPPED OF YOUR DAY. AND CONFIDENCE IT'S A NATURAL DEPRESSIVE RIDDLED WITH THE STAND. FEAR OF WHAT LIES AHEAD. LAWYER WILL HIRE PEOPLE OF YOU FOR NOT SHOWING FOR. SYRIAN CHILDREN WILL END UP IN THE SYSTEM HERE THAT YOU MAY BE FORCED INTO A PLEA BARGAIN BECAUSE YOU KNOW OUR SYSTEM HAS STACKED THE ODDS AGAINST YOU OUR WORST FEAR OF DEATH. BETWEEN APRIL AND JUNE TWENTY TWENTY CALIFORNIA IMPLEMENTED A ZERO BALANCE MERCHANTS THE ORDER BASED ON DIGNITY AND MEDIUM RISK PRESENTED BY THE CALL GOOD NINETEEN PANDEMIC. UNDER THE ORDER WE SAW A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN COUNTY JAIL POPULATIONS ACROSS CALIFORNIA AND WE FOUND NO REAL SPIKE IN CRIME FOR THOSE OFFENSES WHICH WERE ZERO. BAIL ELIGIBLE. THE FTC DATA SHOWS WHY DECREASE OF 30% IN COUNTY JAIL POPULATION BETWEEN. FEBRUARY AND MAY OF TWENTY TWENTY. ALTHOUGH CAL EUROPE SCHEDULE WAS MEANT IN JUNE. TWENTY TWENTY THIRTY ONE COUNTIES WHICH ACCOUNT FOR CLOSE 280% OF CALIFORNIA'S POPULATION KEPT SOME FORM OF GERALD DALE IN PLACE. WHY WOULD THEY DO THAT IF THERE WAS A SPIKE IN CRIMES ANY I WAS VOLATILITY. THERE WASN'T A REPORT PUBLISHED LAST OCTOBER BY THE PUBLIC POLICY INSTITUTE OF CALIFORNIA PROVES THAT THERE WAS NO MAJOR SPIKE IN CRIME FOR THOSE OFFENSES WHICH ARE ZERO BELL ELIGIBLE DURING THE JOB. ORDER IN FOR MAJOR CALIFORNIA CITIES. TO OTHER REPORTS BY THE CALIFORNIA LAW REVISION COMMISSION AND SAFETY AND JUSTICE CHALLENGE ALSO SUPPORT THAT ZERO DALE DID NOT LEAD TO A SPIKE IN CRIME AND ACTUALLY SHOWED. A DECLINE IN SOME CRIMES. FURTHERMORE OUT BY KEY. WHICH ANALYZED BEAR COUNTY ALAMY. SAN FRANCISCO BECAUSE COSTA SAN MATTEO AND SANTA CLARA COUNTIES THAT IN THE IME CALIFORNIA HAD INSTITUTED A-ZERO BILL POLICY. SOMEWHERE BETWEEN 88% 297% OF THE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE ALLOWED TO BAIL OUT FOR FREE. WE'RE NOT REARRESTED DURING A ROUGHLY ONE TO TWO MONTH PERIOD WITH DATA SHOWING THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE RELEASED PRETRIAL DO NOT BE OFFENDED AND THAT. VERY LITTLE IS NEEDED TO ENSURE THEY SHOW UP TO COURT ON TIME THESE COSTS BOTH HUMAN AND FINANCIAL ARE UNJUSTIFIABLE. OF THOSE WITH THIS A RECENT STUDY BY THE MILLION DOLLAR HOUSE PROJECT AT UCLA FOUND THAT IN LOS ANGELES CALIFORNIA. THE LAPD LEVIED OVER THREE POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS IN MONEY BAIL THIS DATA ONLY CAPTURE THE AMOUNT OF BILL LEVY AND PAID FOR PRIOR FIFTEEN A JUDGE FOR THE FIRST TIME. MOREOVER AN ESTIMATED FORTY MILLION DOLLARS IN NONREFUNDABLE BAIL BOND DEPOSITS WAS PAID TO. BAIL AGENTS SIMPLY DO NOT FALL VICTIM TO THE OPPOSITION SCAREMONGERING TACTICS EURODOLLAR BELT. DOES NOT LET DANGEROUS INDIVIDUALS GROUPS ON THE STREET BECAUSE- AND VIOLENT CRIME OR NOT ZERO BELT ELIGIBLE. WE ALSO TOOK A MENACING THE SENATE WHICH THE SENATOR- MOST ELOQUENTLY PUT. OUT BUT I'LL I'LL JUST REITERATE BRIEFLY- WE ENSURED THAT BALLOTS THAT WE CAN READ INTO SOMEBODY'S ABILITY TO PAY- WE ALSO PREVENTED. A PERSON FROM BEING ABLE TO ABUSE RELEASED UNDER YOUR BELT POSTED A REVOLVING DOOR- AND ALSO FURTHER LIMITED THE OFFENSIVE ELIGIBLE FOR ZERO BELL SO FOR THESE REASONS. WE ARE YOUR SUPPORT I.

LAST YEAR WE SAW THE DANGER AND ZERO DOLLAR BAIL SYSTEM AS DEFENDANTS IN JURISDICTIONS AROUND CALIFORNIA. WERE RELEASED AND SUBSEQUENTLY REARRESTED SOMETIMES WITHIN HOURS OF RELEASE ON ZERO DOLLAR BAIL. MORE RELEASES LIKELY MEAN MORE PEOPLE COMMITTING NEW CRIMES OR VIOLATING TERMS OF RELEASED WHICH LIKELY TRANSLATES INTO MORE VICTIMS. SHE AT THE AUTHORS AMENDMENTS. TO ADDRESS THE CRIMES THAT ARE COVERED BY THIS BILL- AND THE ATTEMPT TO- STOP THE REVOLVING DOOR OF PEOPLE CONTINUOUSLY BEING RELEASED UNDER A DOLLAR BILL BUT UNFORTUNATELY WE REMAIN IN OPPOSITION. COUNTIES ACROSS THE STATE HAVE IMPLEMENTED PRE TRIAL RELEASE AN ALTERNATIVE CUSTODY PROGRAMS TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF PERSONS BEING INCARCERATED DURING CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS. THIS BILL.

GOOD AFTERNOON ASSEMBLYMEMBERS LAWYER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS MARK FACT THAT I REPRESENT THE CALIFORNIA PROPERTY CATHOLIC CHURCH OF CERTIFICATION HI PAULA JONES FOR THE TECHNICAL TECHNICAL CHALLENGES ATVI NO POSITION ON THE FIRST SECTION THE BILL BUT HAS SERIOUS CONCERNS ABOUT SECTION FOUR OF THE BILL A BILL LOCATED THE PENAL CODE SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO RE WRITE INSURANCE CONTRACTS WITHOUT CONSIDERATION OF THE ASSEMBLY AND CHURCH COMMITTEE. A BAIL BOND IS A SHORTY POLITIK GREAT OBLIGATIONS UPON THE DAILY TO ENSURE IT THIS TYPE OF BOND LIKE ALL BOGGLES REGULATED BY THE CALIFORNIA ARCHITECTURE. LANGUAGEIN THE BILL WOULD MAKE IT ILLEGAL FOR SURE TO PROVIDE AVAIL PADA CALIFORNIA SURE THE COMPANY WOULD BE FINANCIALLY UNABLE TO POST THE RESERVE REQUIRED BY STATE LAW IN ADDITION THE SURETY COMPANY WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO COVER AT THE AGE OF COMMISSION OR OTHER. UPFRONT COSTS LIKE UNDERWRITING. THE BILL VIOLATES THE BASIC. THAN IN. IS ON THE SIMPLE. ALL THE OLDER BY ALL BY THE TRANSPORT LIKE A SURE YOU BOUGHT. IT IF THE INDIVIDUAL COVERAGE WHEN THE GIRLS COVERED BY THE POLICY THE INSURANCE POLICY. PAYS WHAT IS REQUIRED OF THE POLICY. THE POLICY HOLDER DOES NOT FILE A CLAIM THERE'S NO REFUND GIVEN. THIS WOULD COMPLETELY DESTROY THE UNDERLYING CONCEPT OF THE LOFT LARGE NUMBERS. CONCEPT A LOT OF THE INSURANCE MECHANISM TO SPREAD THE RISK AMONGST THE BROADER GROUP OF POLICY HOLDERS. FOR EXAMPLE A HOMEOWNER COULD PURCHASE HOMEOWNER'S. INSURANCE BUT DOES NOT GET A REFUND. HOUSES NOT BURNED DOWN PAUL YEAR. EVAN IT SURE AND WE POLICIES ONE OF. WAS THE PRICE WE NEED THIS GUY.

GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS PAUL BAUER ON BEHALF OF ALL PRO BAIL BONDS. IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL PARTICULARLY THE SECTION FOR- PART OF THE BILL THANK YOU THANK YOU. OKAY BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. DO YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS. YES MR BURKE WEBSTER SO ARM I'M GOING TO BE SUPPORTING YOUR BILL HAS HASN'T BEEN MOVED YET SO I'LL MOVE IT. OKAY ARM. THE MAIN QUESTION I HAVE AND I HOPE YOUR STAFF MY STAFFER SUPPOSED TO TALK TO YOUR STAFF TO GET THAT QUESTION SEE NO IT HAD A TIME. SO ZERO BAIL FOR MINOR OFFENSES SOME BAIL FOR LARGER FRANCIS AND I ASKED THE SAME QUESTION TO. BONTA WHEN HE BROUGHT THIS- MEASURE BEFORE HERE SO THEY'RE GOING TO BE SOME. PEOPLE HAVE TO PAY BOND. CORRECT OF NOW THE BAIL BONDS CORPORATION IF THEY ONLY GET TO KEEP 5% OF THE 10% SO ANOTHER WORDS- 5% I'M ASSUMING THAT IF IT'S A HUNDRED DOLLARS TO GET TO KEEP FIVE. HELLO THERE FIRST OF ALL THE WAY IT WORKS IS THAT OKAY TO KEEP FOR YOU KNOW HOW. TO CUT CAN JUST WITH ME IS THAT I HAD YEAH I MEAN THE IDEA JUST TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF THE HOMEOWNER'S INSURANCE IDEA IS YOU HAVE EXPOSURE FOR YOUR HOUSE BURNING DOWN FOR THREE AND SIXTY FIVE DAYS- IF YOU SOLD YOUR HOUSE ON DAY ONE AND IT YOU GET A REFUND BECAUSE IF SOMEBODY ELSE HAS IT AND THERE'S NO EXPOSURE. IN THIS MEASURE YOU GET FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS ON THE FIRST DAY YOU'RE PAID ON DAY TWO YOU'RE NEVER CHARGED SO YOU THERE'S NO RISK THAT'S DETERMINED IT'S JUST TO GET YOU OUT OF JAIL FOR TWENTY FOUR HOURS. ON THE ISSUE OF WHAT THEY GET FOR RATE OF RETURN. BUT I WANT TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM WELL ONE OF THREE ISSUE THAT WAS RAISED ALSO BY MARK. IS WHAT YOU GET IS YOU GET YOUR ADMINISTRATIVE FEE PLUS YOU GET A RATE OF RETURN. FOR YOUR MONEY THAT YOU'RE OUT JUST LIKE. YOUR BANKER YOU LEND MONEY OUT FOR CERTAIN TIME YOU HAVE EXPOSURE FOR THAT MONEY. RIGHT AND YOU GET A RATE OF RETURN ON THAT MONEY TO THAT'S IT THERE. YET SO WITH IF YOU WERE OUT FOR THIRTY OR SIXTY OR NINETY DAYS JUST LIKE A CREDIT CARD BILL HOW LONG DID YOU BORROW THE MONEY FOR. YOU GET ADMINISTRATIVE FEE PLUS A RATE OF RETURN. FOR YOUR RISK IT'S A COMMERCIAL TRANSACTION IT'S JUST NOT A- PREDATORY LENDING TRANSACTIONS. THAT I GET ARRESTED FOR SOMETHING ON DAY NUMBER ONE. I'M TO HAVE I'M COMPLEXING SITTING IN JAIL. I READ FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR CHECK TO A BOND COMPANY TO GET ME OUT. THE NEXT DAY THE COURTS AS WELL THERE WAS MISS IDENTITY. THERE'S NO RATIONAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE CHARGES AND ARRESTS. ALL RIGHT SO WHAT ON A HUNDRED DOLLARS. THAT FEATHER BAILS BONDSMEN. UP JUST TO MAKE THE MATH EASY. AND IF THE PERSON SAYS OUT FOR FIVE DAYS WHAT. HOW DO YOU FIGURE OUT WHAT THE BAIL BONDSMAN GET WILL BE THE MINISTRY OF FEE AND FOR PURPOSES OF THE ARGUMENTS THAT WERE MADE ABOUT ONE OR THREE THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER'S JOB IS RICARDO LARA HAS SUPPORTING THIS. IS IT'S THE WHOLE UNDERLYING PURPOSE IF YOU AROUND FOR THE WON ALL THREE DEBATES IS TO PROTECT CONSUMERS I WAS HERE YEAH OKAY I HATED IT DOES THAT'S ANOTHER STORY HOMERS AND SO AND THEY SET UP RATES AND WHAT YOUR RATE'S GOING TO BE AND WHAT THOSE CHARGES WILL BE JUST LIKE ANY OTHER RATES THAT ARE DETERMINED THROUGH INSURANCE WILL BE DETERMINED AND THEY'LL FIGURE OUT WHAT THOSE RATES ARE AND WHAT THOSE NUMBERS ARE. WHAT ADMINISTRATIVE FEE SHOULD BE I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE MYSTERY OF COSTS ARE MAYBE IT'S OUR USE OF THOUSAND DOLLARS A SIMPLE EXAMPLE MAYBE MISTER FEES A HUNDRED FIFTY BUCKS IN THE INTERESTS ON AND FIFTY BUCKS AND YOU GET THREE DOLLARS ALL RIGHT SO. WITH THE TRASH BUT IT SHOULD BE IN. YOU'RE SAYING THERE SHOULD BE ENOUGH. SUCH THAT. BAIL BOND INDUSTRY CAN ACTUALLY PROVIDE THE BOND. YES YOU JUST CAN'T BE SO. PROFITABLE AS IT IS NOW. WHEN WE HAVE COMPANIES THAT HAVE TESTIFIED. THAT THEY JUST DON'T PAY IT'S THE- YOU'VE GOT THIS INTERESTING RELATIONSHIP IF I COULD JUST TAKE A MOMENT BECAUSE IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT. IF YOU HAVE A TEN THOUSAND DOLLAR BOUGHT A HUNDRED THOUSAND UPON THE FEE IS TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS. WHICH IS RIGHT UP IN THE AIR. OF THE TEN THOUSAND THE BOND COMPANY PAYS THE BONDING COMPANY THE BAIL BONDS COMPANY PAYS TWENTY THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS. TO THE SURETY COMPANY TO GET THE SURETIES. SO THEY GET 23% RATE OF RETURN SO THEY GET THE CASH. THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE WHAT HAPPENS IS IN THE OLD DAYS YOU KNOW YOU PUT THE MONEY UP TODAY. NO ONE HAS A TEN THOUSAND SO IF I GO TO PUB HOURS COMPANY AND I SAY WELL I ONLY GOT SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS. THE SALE TAKE THE SIX THOUSAND THEY PAID THE TWENTY THREE HUNDRED. THE OTHER THIRTY SEVEN DOLLARS GOES TO IN THE POCKET THE BAIL AND THEY SET UP A PAYMENT PLAN THESE PAYMENT PLANS IS TO SET YOU UP ON. COULD LAST YEARS WE'VE SEEN STORIES WHERE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN PAID FORTY SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A TEN THOUSAND DOLLAR BAIL. WHICH IS WHOLE PREDATORY LENDING INDUSTRY THAT'S GROWN UP BECAUSE THE COST OF THESE BONDS. IN BECAUSE IT'S ALMOST LIKE AN AUTOMOBILE AS WITH THESE USED CAR DEALERS ARE FINANCING THESE THINGS AND THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENED. SO IT SHOULD BE A REASONABLE RATE OF RETURN BANKS TO IT ALL THE TIME. BANK IT'S A- COMPANY THAT'S ALREADY ANSWERED THE QUESTION SO IT'LL BE SET BY THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER. AND SATURATE THAT THE BAIL BONDS PEOPLE CAN. ACTUALLY DO IT YEAH. IT WILL PUT THEM OUT OF BUSINESS OKAY THAT'S THAT'S THE MAIN QUESTION I HAD BECAUSE IF THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE STILL PAYING BAIL. YOU NEED TO HAVE A BAIL BONDS INDUSTRY AND AS WE'VE TOLD ME THAT YES THE BE ENOUGH TO SUPPORT. FIVE I'M HAPPY YOU'VE ANSWERED THE QUESTION. THE ONE THING I WANT TO SAY THEY WANT TO MISLEAD YOU ON THIS IT WILL CHANGE THE UNDERLYING FINANCIAL- A- FRAMEWORK OF HOW THESE COMPANIES WORK. THEY WILL BE THEY WILL RUN DIFFERENTLY THEY WILL GET A RATE OF RETURN BANKS TO IT ALL THE TIME CREDIT CARD COMPANIES ALL SORTS OF COMPANIES. GET A RATE OF RETURN WE AS A GOVERNMENT SAY YOU CAN'T GET OUT TO PEOPLE. AND THE LIKE SO WE'LL GIVE A RATE OF RETURN NO ONE ONCE IN THE PAST PUT HIM OUT OF BUSINESS IN THAT SENSE. BUT WHAT'S REALLY GOING TO HAPPEN WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE HUMPHRIES CASE WITH HUMPHREY SAYS. YOU HAVE TO WHEN YOU SET THE BOND THE FIRST ARE THE ZERO BONDS FOR THE FOR THE CHARTER SMALL CRIMES. THEN IF YOU HAVE TO HAVE A BOND. AND THE COURT DETERMINES THAT THE COURT HAS TO LOOK AT THE ABILITY TO PAY. SO WHEN YOU SAY TO PUT ABOUT A BUSINESS THIS. COMPANIES CASE LARGELY PUTS ABOUT IT. JUST BECAUSE- BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENS IS IF I ONLY COULD AFFORD THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS. AND THAT'S WHAT THE COURT'S GOING TO CHARGE FOR BAIL. AND THERE'S NO INCENTIVE FOR THE BILL COMPANIES TO ENGAGE THE REASON THE BILL COMPANIES ARE STILL ENGAGING. DURING THE PANDEMIC IS THEY REALLY WERE GOING AFTER DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CASES. WE HAVE A REPORT HERE THAT SHOWS THAT THEY MADE A TON OF MONEY. BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENED A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CASES THEY WERE ABLE TO GET CHARGE PEOPLE OUT OF MONEY WHEN THEY WERE. GETTING IN FIGHTS WITH THEIR SPOUSES. GET OUT OF JAIL. AND MAKE MONEY ON THE FRONT END. AND SO THAT'S WHERE THEY WERE ABLE TO DO IT BUT SO I WOULD SUGGEST THAT. IT WOULDN'T BE AN UNDERSTATEMENT BY ME TO SAY THIS WOULD DRAMATICALLY IMPACT THE BUSINESS. BUT I WOULD SUGGEST IS GOING TO BE DRAMATICALLY IMPACTED JUST BY HUMPHRIES THAT SAYS ABILITY TO PAY. RIGHT SO YOU BAIL BONDS ARE ALL ABOUT. LEVERAGING SOMEBODY. GOING TO THEIR GRANDMOTHER TO THEIR SISTER TO THEIR- MOTHER TO ANYBODY TO GET. BORROW MONEY. TO THAT HAVE ENOUGH CASH TO PAY THE BAIL. OUT AT. OKAY JUST ONE MORE THING IT'S REALLY. NICE AND THAT IS THE RATE OF THE IDEAS ONE. STOP DALE. WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF BAIL. APOLOGIZE AND- VOTE. IT'S TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE SHOW UP IN SANTA CLARA 95% OF PRE TRIAL APPEARANCES. FOR DEFENDANTS. OKAY THAT WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO. SO YOU GO THROUGH J. JERSEY KENTUCKY YOU TRY TO GET TO GO TO JAIL COME UP HOW DO YOU DO THAT. TEXT YOU LITERALLY CAN TEXT PEOPLE. AND YOU GET THEM TO SHOW UP. SO YES YOUR POINT YOUR POINT IS WELL TAKEN I JUST WANTED TO GIVE YOU MORE NW ONES ON IT I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT. BECAUSE I DON'T HONESTLY CHIU THAT SOME OKAY NO YOU DON'T YOU ANSWER THE QUESTION THOROUGHLY AND I PARTICULARLY. APPRECIATE THE LAST PART WHERE YOU SAID. BASICALLY SOMEONE SHOULD BE ABLE TO PAY THEIR OWN BAIL AND WON'T HAVE TO GO TO THE BALLOT BOX WENT. FINE THANK YOU. THANK YOU SORRY FOR THE LONG ANSWER QUESTIONS ARE. THANK YOU MR VICE CHAIR AND THANK YOU MISTER HERTZBERG FOR YOUR- PASSIONATE PRESENTATION DAY I THINK WE CAN ALL SEE HOW MUCH YOU CARE ABOUT THIS ISSUE AND CLEARLY WORKED ON FOR MANY YEARS. AND SO I WANT TO START BY SAYING THAT THERE'S MANY PARTS OF THIS BILL THAT I. I REALLY APPRECIATE AND ONE IS ACTUALLY SECTION FOR. WHICH ADDRESSES EXACTLY WHAT. WE JUST HAD A LONG CONVERSATION WITH WHICH IS THAT IF YOU ARE. IF AN ACTION IS DISMISSED OR YOU WERE NEVER CHARGE THE YOU DO NOT OWE MONEY I MEAN MAKING MONEY OFF AS WE KNOW. PEOPLE OF COLOR ARE RESTED IN FAR HIGHER NUMBERS. AND THEN IF THEY'RE NOT CHARGER CASE THERE'S MISS THE FACT THAT SOMEBODY IS PROFITING. OF THOSE ARRESTS IS. I MEAN I'M JUST WOULD BE AN UNDERSTATEMENT SO I THINK THAT THAT PIECE OF THIS BILL IS ACTUALLY CRITICAL TO GETTING IT THE ISSUE WE HAVE. WITH FAILING CALIFORNIA. I ALSO AM A HUGE. SUPPORTER OF GETTING RID OF MONEY BAIL I THINK THAT THE FACT THAT OUR SYSTEM CURRENTLY INCARCERATE THOSE WHO ARE IMPOVERISHED MORE THAN THOSE WHO ARE ARRESTED SOCIETY IS ALSO UPSIDE DOWN RIGHT WHAT WE SHOULD BE. HOLDING THOSE WHO POSE A SAFETY RISK NOT THOSE WHO CAN'T PAY. AND I APPRECIATE YOU TRYING TO GET THAT I THINK THE ONE THING THAT I CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE WITH IS THAT. AS I UNDERSTAND IT THE HUMPHRIES CASE DID A LOT OF THINGS SOME OF WHICH ARE HERE I THINK IT'S A WONDERFUL THING TO SEE IF THERE ARE OTHER MEASURES BESIDES HOLDING SOMEONE. THAT CAN PROTECT THE PUBLIC SAFETY BEFORE WE EVER HOLD SOMEONE BECAUSE YOU KNOW THAT. WHEN SOMEONE ISN'T AT HOME TO CARRY ON THEIR JOB OR PAY THEIR RENTS THAT THAT AFFECTS THEIR ABILITY TO STAY. CLEAN AND NOT RUSTED OF EIGHT. BUT MY CONCERN IS THAT FOR SOMEONE WHO COMES IN. ON A LOW LEVEL OFFENSE. BUT FOR EXAMPLE THE OFFICERS FIND AN ARSENAL OF WEAPONS RIGHT BUT THAT'S- FINE. THAT'S NOT A FELON IN POSSESSION CASE- YOU KNOW THAT PERSON POSES A PUBLIC SAFETY THREAT AND UNDER THIS MODEL THE COURT WOULD HAVE NO JURISDICTION TO HOLD THAT INDIVIDUAL EVEN IF THE COURT AFTER THE HUMPHRIES ANALYSIS. FOUND CLEAR AND CONVINCING EVIDENCE THAT THEY ARE A PUBLIC SAFETY RISK AND THAT CONCERNS ME IF I JUST WANTED YOU TO ADDRESS THAT. PAGE NINETEEN OF THE HUMPHRIES CASE SAYS. THAT WE IN SIMILARLY INTERPRET THE CONSTITUTION TO BAR COURT FROM CAUSING INTERESTED TO BE DETAINED PRE TRIAL BASED ON- CONCERNS REGARDING THE SAFETY OF THE PUBLIC IN VICTIM UNLESS THE COURT FINDS FIRST FINDS CLEAR AND CONVINCING EVIDENCE THAT NO OTHER CONDITIONS OF RELEASE COULD MEANS WE PROTECT THOSE INTERESTS RIGHT GOES ON THE STATE ON REFLECTION WE AGREE WITH HUMPHRIES. THE HOBBIT THAT THE STANDARD OF PROOF SHOULD LIKEWISE BE CLEAR CONVINCING THERE'S NO COMPELLING REASON TO GO TO THE VERY STANDARD SO THE POINT IS I THINK THE CASE AND I DON'T WANT TO GET TO THE DEPRESSION HE RAISED FOR THE JUDGES JUST GAVE TO US- JUST. JUST RECENTLY. ON THIS IS REALLY A STICKY POIN IN THIS IN THIS WHOLE LARGER DISCUSSION BECAUSE THERE'S A SERIES OF DIFFERENT. THOUGHTS IN THIS WHOLE WORLD RIGHT. ONE OF THE BIG CHALLENGES IT YOU KNOW THE IDEA IS THAT. THERE'S NO DIRECT STATEMENT AS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THAT SAYS THE COURT HAS THE RIGHT TO DO THIS IT JUST BUT THERE'S A CONSTITUTIONAL STANDARD THAT'S IMPLICIT WHAT THE JUDGES TRADE ASSOCIATION AS OPPOSED TO JUDICIAL COUNCIL WE HAVE BEEN DEALING WITH THE JUDGES OF SITUATION. WE HAVE BEEN WORKING VERY LOSELY WITH THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL THEY HAVE NOT OPPOSE THIS IT'S REALLY THE JUDGES. AND THIS IS ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT WERE FEARFUL OF. AN EARLY ANSWER TO IT TO BE VERY FRANK BUT IT'S VERY HARD AND I AGREE WITH- SOME OF THE ADVOCATES ON THE OTHER SIDE THAT HAVE OPPOSED PROP TWENTY FIVE AND THE LIKE. THEY FEEL. THAT WHAT'S HAPPENED IN THE BILL INDUSTRY AND ONE OF THE REASONS WHY BAYLOR SO HIGH. IS THE JUDGE'S ARTIFICIALLY AGREE TO SETTING THESE THINGS HIGH WE HAVE EVIDENCE WITH A NO ATTENTION AT ALL. SO THAT WHAT THEY DO IS THEY CAN USE THE EXCUSE OF A HIGH BAIL TO KEEP SOMEBODY IN JAIL. WHO SHOULDN'T BE IN JAIL IS NOT A FLIGHT RISK IS NOT A PUBLIC RACES BUT THAT MIGHT RESULT IN A- IN A SITUATION FOR THEM LIKE. THE WILLIE HORTON CASE OR LIKE WHAT HAPPENED IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD WE REPRESENT. YOU KNOW WHERE JUDGE GETS TAKEN OUT. SO THEY'RE TRYING TO PROTECT THEMSELVES AND SO JUDGES IN THIS HAPPENED TO US IS ONE OF THE BIG DEBATES WE HAD WITH THE CHIEF JUSTICE. AND THIS GROUP. TOGETHER WITH THE ADVOCATES OF THE OF THE SITE. WAS WHAT'S THE POWER OF THE COURT THERE'S A FEAR. AMONG PEOPLE WHO ARE IMPACTED. THE JUDGES ARE GOING TO BE TOO EASILY. MANIPULATED THAT REGARD AND SO WE WERE VERY CAUTIOUS SO WHAT THE WAY WE WROTE THIS AND THE REASON WHY WE WORK THIS WAY AND LEFT A- CONSTITUTIONAL STANDARD. BASED UPON THAT THE COURT PURSES. PUTTING A SPECIFIC PROVISION THAT SAYS IF THIS IS THE CASE. WE WANT TO GO THERE WE FELT THAT THE CASE WAS CLEAR ENOUGHIN THAT REGARD AND THERE'S A NUMBER OF OTHER AREAS IN THE CASE. WHERE WE DID NOT SPECIFICALLY. REVISED BLUEPRINTS FOR EXAMPLE WE SAID WE HAVEN'T CODIFIED THE CONDITIONS WERE PRE TRIAL. RELEASE A COURT MUST CONSIDER WE DID NOT. LOOK AT WHAT A COURT MUST LOOK FOR REAL LAST RESTRICTIVE ALTERNATIVES WITHIN JUST FINE WITH THOSE WHERE WE DIDN'T DEFINE THE COURT NEEDS TO CONDUCT A DUE PROCESS EQUAL PROTECTION. HEARING IN EACH CASE SO MY POINT TO YOU IS. WE'RE TRYING TO BALANCE THIS IN A WAY. THAT IS SENSITIVE TO AND UNDERSTANDS THE ARGUMENTS. BY PEOPLE THAT FEEL THAT WERE OVER POLICE THAT WERE IN A SITUATION WHERE BLACK AND BROWN PEOPLE. ARE INAPPROPRIATELY PUT IN JAIL THAT THEY'RE HELD IN JAIL THAT THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM OFFICE UNFAIR TO THEM. WHERE WE STILL HAVE THE GUIDANCE ON THE OTHER HAND THE CONSTITUTIONAL GUIDANCE WHICH I THINK IS CLEAR. BUT JUDGES YOU KNOW WHAT THEY WANT IS THEY WANT THE STATUTES SO THEY DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT MAKING A DECISION. AND SO LOOK WHAT WE'RE STILL LOOKING AT THAT I'M NOT SUGGESTING THAT WE'RE NOT. BUT I'M NOT A ON SENSITIVE CHIU. THE ARGUMENTS I'VE HEARD OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN. ABOUT JUDGES OVER REACTING AND I WOULD SUGGEST THAT THERE'S A DISTINCTION IN THE PUBLIC GET KILLED BY A BUNCH OF JUDGES ON THIS BUT- BETWEEN THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL WHICH IS LOOKING TO THE GOVERNANCE OF THE- JUDICIAL BRANCH. AND THE JUDGES ASSOCIATION WHICH IS A TRADE ASSOCIATION AND THERE'S A SPOT THERE AND THAT'S WHY THIS LATE LETTER THE CAME IN FROM A JUDGE ASSOCIATION I JUST SAW. IS DIFFERENT FROM ALL THE HOMEWORK THAT WE'VE DONE TO JUDICIAL COUNCIL. I DON'T THAT HELPS BUT I WANTED TO TRY TO BE SENSITIVE TO. THE LARGER ARGUMENT INTO BRICKS PLANE YOU AN HONEST AND DIRECT WAY. WHY WE'RE DEBATING THIS THING BUT WE'RE STILL LOOKING AT IT. WILL BE MEETING WITH THE ADVOCATES DURING THE BREAK HOPEFULLY IF THIS PASSES. AND TRYING TO FIGURE IT OUT BUT I AM SENSITIVE TO THEIR POINT OF VIEW. THANK YOU AND I APPRECIATE THAT AND I THINK I ACTUALLY DID NOTICE THAT THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL IS NOT IN OPPOSITION TO THE JUDGE'S DECISION WITHIN FOUND THAT INTERESTING MYSELF- YOU KNOW I APPRECIATE YOU LEAVING BE. EXEMPTED ACT CRIMES TO. THE HUMPHREY STANDARD I THINK THAT'S APPROPRIATE I GUESS I STILL I JUST REMAIN CONCERNED ABOUT THAT. THE ONES THAT ARE COVERED BY THIS LAW FOR WHICH AND THERE WILL BE ZERO. FAIL AND THERE'S NO ANALYSIS A PUBLIC SAFETY THREAT I THINK WE REALLY NEED TO LOOK AT THAT. AND WE IN THIS COMMITTEE GIVE JUDICIAL DISCRETION. ALL THE TIME WE DECIDED ON MISS ROLLINS BILL A FEW MINUTES AGO AND SO. TO THE EXTENT OF THIS COMMITTEE OFTEN SAYS THE JUDICIAL DISCRETION IS APPROPRIATE IT'S HARD FOR ME TO SAY THAT IN THIS CONTEXT IT'S NOT. AND SO I STRUGGLE TO SAY THAT. ON ON THOSE LOW LEVEL. THERE'S NEVER AN OPERA. TO SOMEONE IS A THREAT THE COMMUNITY AND SO. I DON'T THINK I'M READY TO SUPPORT IT TODAY BUT I REALLY DO LOOK FORWARD TO GETTING THERE BECAUSE I THINK THE WORK YOU'RE DOING HERE IS SO CRITICAL. AND AGAIN I REALLY APPRECIATE A LOT OF THE NEW ONES AND STUFF. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE. OKAY CENTER YOUR TO YOUR OPPORTUNITY TO CLOSE THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I WANT TO THANK A STEP. ON KNOWN AS FOR IS ALWAYS BROUGHT TESTED ON THE MATT WE'VE- THIRTY ANY OTHER HOUSE THE MEASURE- AND- BOB THE RE IS BECAUSE I THINK IT'S DIFFERENT WHAT WE SEE BEFORE. IT ISN'T ONE THESE CLOSE TO THE LONG. IS FOR. REALLY ISN'T TO PROVIDE A BLUEPRINT THAT WORKS- BASED UPON. A BAIL SYSTEM WHERE WE KEEP BAILING PLACE WE DON'T MAKE IT ILLEGAL LIKE WE DID WITH TO ELIMINATE BAIL LIKE WAS DONE UNDER. S. B. TEN. ARMED AND WE HAVE TAKEN A NUMBER OF AMENDMENTS THAT RELATES TO EXEMPTING FURTHER CRIMES AND- DEALING WITH THE REVOLVING DOOR SITUATION. AND I THINK THE ARGUMENTS THAT WERE MADE BY THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY REALLY DON'T HOLD BECAUSE- THE WHOLE PURPOSE OF AS I SUGGESTED IN MY- LONG WINDED ANSWER TO ASSEMBLYMEMBER QUIRK. IS THAT ARMED. THE WHOLE PURPOSE OF THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER WHO SUPPORT OF THIS IS TO PROTECT CONSUMERS AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE WITH RESPECT TO THIS LIMITATION ON HOW MUCH MONEY- THESE COMPANIES CAN MAKE AND AGAIN IT'S A SITUATION WHERE I WOULD SUSPECT THAT IT WILL BE A MUCH SMALLER INDUSTRY FOR NO OTHER REASON THAN JUST PEOPLE'S ABILITY TO PAY VERSUS. YOU KNOW THE ABILITY TO GO OUT AND SQUEEZE THEM UP TO GET AS MUCH MONEY OUT OF THEM AS POSSIBLE AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT FROM THIS ESTEEMED COMMITTEE. OKAY THANK YOU SENATOR NIGHT I THINK THE CHAIR IS RECOMMENDING IT TO PASS. SO WE'LL GO AHEAD AND CALL FOR THE QUESTION. SB TWO SIX TWO BY SENATOR HERTZBERG THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER. LACKEY NO LACKING NO BARRICADE CAN. BACK BACK HE HAD NOT VOTING LEE LEE HI CORK.

THAT FIRST AMENDMENT DEMONSTRATIONS MARCHES PROTESTS AND RALLIES I CAN ADVANCE ON OBSTRUCTED AT THIS BILL SUPPORTED BY THE ACLU. CALIFORNIA BROADCASTERS ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA NEWS PUBLISHERS PUBLISHERS ASSOCIATION AS WELL AS ETHNIC MEDIA SERVICES IN TWO DAYS.

GOOD AFTERNOON- MY NAME IS ADAM ROSE AND I SERVE ON THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS FOR THE LOS ANGELES PRESS CLUB MY ORGANIZATION JOINT BEEN UNPRECEDENTED COALITION ACCORDING SB NINETY EIGHT AND THAT INCLUDES MORE THAN TWENTY PRESS GROUPS AND LABOR UNIONS. COLLECTIVELY WE REPRESENT THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIA JOURNALISTS WHO DON'T TYPICALLY ENDORSE LEGISLATION. JOURNALISM IS NOT A CRIME. YEAH IN A RECENT TWELVE MONTH PERIOD DOZENS OF JOURNALISTS WERE ARRESTED OR DETAINED DURING PROTESTS IN CALIFORNIA THEY WERE JUST DOING THEIR JOB AS THE EYES AND EARS OF THE PUBLIC. MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR YOUR STAFF MAY HAVE BEEN APPLIED TO WITH PHOTO AND VIDEO EVIDENCE THAT WAS GATHERED BY THE JOURNALIST COALITION. MUCH IT SHOWS LAW ENFORCEMENT ATTEMPTS TO REMOVE PEOPLE DURING UNLAWFUL ASSEMBLY- THE SHOULD HAVE EASILY RECOGNIZED AS CRASS. PREVENTING THEM FROM BEARING WITNESS TO THESE IMPORTANT PUBLIC EVENTS IN CRITICAL POLICE ACTIVITIES. WHOSE NAME. I'M SORRY DID YOU LOSE THEIR- HE FINISHED. OH NO SORRY I THINK WE I THINK WE A LOT SIGNAL THERE IS AN AWKWARD FINISH WHAT I THINK IS AROUND. NO NO THAT WASN'T WHAT I THINK IS IT WITH THIS PRESENTATION MUCH OF IT SHOWS LAW ENFORCEMENT X. TO REMOVE PEOPLE DURING UNLAWFUL ASSEMBLY. MANY SHOULD VERY EASILY RECOGNIZED AS PRESS PREVENTING THEM FROM BEARING WITNESS TO IMPORTANT PUBLIC EVENTS. IN CRITICAL POLICE ACTIVITIES. EVEN A BRIEF DETAINMENT CAN KILL THE G. DOT CHILL THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS OF THE PRESS. AND STOP THEM FROM DOING THEIR JOB. WE'VE SEEN PLENTY IN HAND BECAUSE IN THAT TIES. BUT THIS OFTEN GOES FURTHER. WE SEE OFFICER TO EXPLICITLY THREATENED TO BREAK CAMERAS. WE'VE SEEN SEVERAL ACTUALLY BROKEN. AND WE CAN OFFICERS MAKE INEXPLICABLE UNPROVOKED ASSAULT. WE'VE SEEN INJURIES. ONE REPORTER DO YOU HAVE THE FEELING. KNOCKED OUT OF HIS TEACHER. OFTEN WE SEE PEOPLE. A DISPROPORTIONATE WHO ARE BLOCKING BROWN JR. WHAT WE DO NOT. OUR JOURNALISTS. WITH POLICE TRYING TO ENTER COMMAND POST OR COMMITTING ANY CRIME. THE CULPRIT HERE IS NOT JOURNALISTS BUT A LEGAL GRAY AREA. SB NINETY EIGHT WILL FIX IT BUT CLEANING THE MODEST PROVISIONS- EXPLICIT PERMISSION THE PRESS CURRENTLY HAS TO BE PRESENT AT THE DOCTOR. AND APPLYING THEM TO UNLAWFUL ASSEMBLY. IT PUT CALIFORNIA PENAL CODE CLEARLY ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE FIRST AMENDMENTBUT MOST OF ALL IT AFFIRMS THAT JOURNALISM IS NOT A CRIME. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR NOW- HOPING TO HEAR FROM KEVIN BAKER FROM THE ACLU. YES MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS KEVIN BAKER DIRECTOR OF GOVERNMENTAL RELATIONS FOR ACLU CALIFORNIA ACTION IS NOT REALLY MUCH I CAN ADD TO THE ELOQUENT TESTIMONY OF MISTER THOSE. AS YOU KNOW THE ACLU HAS LONG ADVOCATED FOR THE RIGHTS OF THE MEDIA TO REPORT ON ISSUES OF PUBLIC INTEREST MORE RECENTLY WE'VE BEEN CALLED ON TO PROVIDE LEGAL REPRESENTATION TO REPORTERS WHO HAVE NOT ONLY BEEN WARMLY PROHIBITED OR RESTRICTED FROM DOING THEIR WORK. ASSEMBLY COURTED THE MISTREATMENT. BY LAW ENFORCEMENT OF THE PROTEST. THIS IS A MODEST BILL AND EVEN NARROWER THAN SIMILAR MEASURE YOU PASSED LAST YEAR. IT SIMPLY CLARIFIES BASIC PRESS FREEDOMS GUARANTEED BY THE FIRST AMENDMENT AND ALREADY RECOGNIZED BY STATUTE IN SIMILAR CONTEXTS. YOU MIGHT THINK THIS BILL SHOULD NOT BE NECESSARY THAT OUR EXPERIENCE UNFORTUNATELY HAS SHOWN THAT IT IS. AND WE ASK CLEARLY THANK YOU. THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY YOU OF WITNESSES IN THIS ROOM THAT WOULD LIKE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. THAT'S NOT THE OPERATOR COULD WE GO TO. THOSE WISH TO EXPRESS THEIR SUPPORT ON THE FALL. FOUR COMMENT INTO THE PORT PLEASE PRESS ONE THEN ZERO THAT COMMAND AGAIN ONE ZERO. LINE THREE HUNDRED FOUR YOU'RE MY KID UP. GOOD AFTERNOON DONNA THATCHER BEGINNING A LOT CHANGES FROM THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS THE PORTABLE MOBILE IN TWELVE THANK YOU. NINE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THREE.

SURE YOU TOMORROW HAPPEN IN A KITCHEN WORKER AMERICAN NINETEEN SUPPORT THANK YOU. WHY TWO HUNDRED NINETY SIX. OKAY GOOD AFTERNOON THIS IS BRITNEY BY SAUDI WITH THE CALIFORNIA NEWS PUBLISHERS ASSOCIATION IN STRONG SUPPORT AND SB NINETY EIGHT. THANK YOU. AND WE HAVE NO FURTHER COMMENT AT THIS TIME. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE WILL NOW GO TO JONATHON FELDMAN. WHO WAS THE WITNESS IN OPPOSITION. GOOD AFTERNOON CARE MEMBERS- THANK YOU- JOHN CONSULTING ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA POLICE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION I LIKE THE FIRST START BY SAYING THAT- WE DO NOT CONDONE OR DEFEND ANY OFFICER MISCONDUCT DIRECTED AT THE MEDIA. BUT WE ARE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSED SB NINETY EIGHT WHICH CONTAINS SOME OF THE SAME FLAWS WE IDENTIFIED IN THE PREVIOUS VERSION OF THIS MEASURE. WAS VETOED BY THE GOVERNOR LAST YEAR. SB NINETY EIGHT WOULD ALLOW MEDIA ACCESS TO ANY. IMMEDIATE AREA SURROUNDING ANY EMERGENCY FIELD COMMAND POST OR ANY OTHER COMMAND POST PLEASE FIND A ROLLING CLOSURE. AND EMERGENCY FEEL COMMAND POST AND ANY OTHER COMMAND POSTS ARE NOT DEFINED SO WHAT BECAUSE BROAD ACCENTS SB NINETY EIGHT. CREATES- HE NEW ACCESS TO CERTAIN AREAS DURING- OPERATIONS. AND ALSO A NEW PENAL CODE VIOLATION FOR ANY OFFICER THAT EITHER INTERFERES WITH OR OBSTRUCTING MEDIA COULD GUARD THE TO FIT IN IN THE COURSE AND SCOPE OF THEIR DUTY. IT'S UNCLEAR WHAT THE PENALTY WOULD BE FOR THE OFFICER IN THIS CASE BUT OUR LEGAL INTERPRETATION IS THAT ANY UNSPECIFIED PENALTY AND PENAL CODE REVERTS TO A MISDEMEANOR. BUT BECAUSE IT'S UNCLEAR WHAT THE PENALTY WOULD BE WE HAVE ASKED THE AUTHORS OFFICE LAST MONTH FOR A JOINT MEETING WITH LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL TO GET CLARITY ON THIS MATTER. SB NINETY EIGHT FURTHER COMPLICATES AND COMPROMISED THE OFFICERS BY STATING- NEWS REPORTERS SHALL NOT BE CITED FOR THE FAILURE TO DISPERSE A VIOLATION OF CURFEW OR A VIOLATION OF PARAGRAPH ONE. OF SUBDIVISION A OF SECTION ONE FORTY EIGHT. THIS IS SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE YOU KNOW CODE SECTION ONE FORTY EIGHT AT THE SECTION. LAW ENFORCEMENT AND OTHER EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROFESSIONALS USED TO CITE SOMEONE FOR OBSTRUCTING. AN OFFICER OR EMERGENCY MEDICAL TECHNICIAN IN THE DISCHARGE OF THEIR DUTIES. THEREFORE SB NINETY EIGHT IN OUR INTERPRETATION THOSE TWO THINGS THAT ARE PROBLEMATIC. IT POTENTIALLY CRIMINALIZES AN OFFICER FOR INTERFERING WITH THE MEDIA. AND IT PREVENTS AN OFFICER FROM MOVING REMOVING THE MEDIA FOR OBSTRUCTING THE OFFICER- THERE'S BEEN DISCUSSION ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT AN OFFICER CAN STILL CITE SOMEONE FOR ANOTHER CODE SECTION TO REMOVE THEM AT A CERTAIN POINT BUT IT'S UNCLEAR WHAT CODE SECTION THAT MIGHT BE TO US. AND REGARDLESS. REMOVING PT ONE FORTY EIGHT CREATE CON IN THE CAN. IN YOUR BILL OF THE OP. WE CLEAR UNDERSTAND THE NEED TO IMPORTANCE OF ALLOWING ME ACCESS TO COVER THE IMPORTANT. BUT AS NINETY EIGHT PUTS OFF IN A- AND ANTI POSITION- WE HOPE. WORK TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS BUT THE ALL. WHICH WE SHARED. WERE BUT HOPEFULLY CAN SO WITHOUT JEOPARDIZE THE SAFETY OF THE OFFICERS AND THE PUBLIC. UNFORTUNATES CURRENT FORM TODAY WE MUST RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR NOTEBOOK THANK YOU. THANK YOU DO WE HAVE ANY. OF PERSONS IN THE ROOM THAT WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. WE DO NOT. OKAY OPERATOR TO READ NOW LISTEN.

HE SHARES WE MAY HAVE SOMEBODY. DID YOU WANT TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION SPEAK THIS BILL AT ALL SIR OKAY. OKAY WE WILL THEN NOW COME BACK TO MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THERE ANY COMMENTS OR WISH TO BE SHARE. YES SIR SOME OF THE COURT. CHAU YOU'VE NARROWED THE BILL FROM LAST YEAR SO THAT IT SPECIFIC ABOUT KIND OF ORGANIZATION HAVE TO BE A REPORTER FOR HOW WOULD A POLICE OFFICER- RECOGNIZE THAT YOU'RE ONE OF THOSE- OUR PEOPLE IN A RECOGNIZED- REPORTING ARE. SO I ME AS THEY DO NOW- IS WHEN THERE IS A MEMBER OF THE PRESS- THERE THERE WOULD NOT BE ANY CHANGE IN THAT THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF DISCUSSION ABOUT- PRESS CREDENTIALS NINE ABOUT THIS ISSUE IT'S BEEN DEBATED IN THIS STATE FOR MANY YEARS IN FACT DECADES I DON'T THINK THERE WOULD BE ANY AGREEMENT IN REGARDS TO DOING A UNIVERSAL PRESS CREDENTIAL WE'RE STARTING NOW SEE SOME OF THE LARGEST AT CITIES ACROSS THE NATION DO AWAY WITH CHRIS PRESS CREDENTIALS- IN A- HAVE TO SAY I. THE MISDEMEANOR ISSUE IF IT'S ALL RIGHT MR QUIRK- AT THE DIRECTION OF THIS COMMITTEE LAST YEAR WE TOOK OUT THE LANGUAGE REGARDS THE MISDEMEANOR. SO WE TOOK THEM AS AUTHOR AND THEN MINCED LAST YEAR- AND WE REMOVED THAT DEFINITION SO- IN THIS IS NOT DEFAULT TO A MISDEMEANOR AS WELL- BECAUSE THE BILL DOES NOT CLARA A VIOLATION- PENAL CODE NINETY EIGHT HEY SO I'M HAPPY TO CONTINUE TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION BUT- OKAY SO IT MIGHT. BE DIFFICULT. I MEAN I DON'T THINK THERE IS ANY CHALLENGES NOW AND IN JUST BEING HONEST AND WE TAKE A LOOK TOOK A LOOK JUST RECENTLY IN LOS ANGELES. AN INDIVIDUAL WHO IS CLEARLY MARKED AS A OS ANGELES TIMES REPORTER WAS STILL ARRESTED. OKAY THEN THE SECOND PART- OF THIS IS- THERE SHOULD BE THERE PROBABLY ARE SOME AREAS WHERE THERE IS CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION GOING ON- AND THEY SUGGESTED IN THE ANALYSIS IS THAT PERHAPS YOU SHOULD PUT SOMETHING IN THERE THAT. I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT WOULD BE THAT THERE WAS A SUGGESTION AND ANALYSIS ABOUT- CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION REMAIN CONFIDENTIAL. YEAH I THINK THAT THERE WOULD BE CONCERN IN REGARDS TO ENTRY OF COMMAND POST SO FOR EXAMPLE- IF WE'RE LOOKING AT A MOBILE COMMAND POST WE'VE ALL SEEN THOSE REALLY LARGE- RV LOOKING VEHICLES- WHERE- THE HEART OF THE OPERATION WHETHER IT'S UP TO SIX HUNDRED. SO I THINK FOR US- FIRST AND FOREMOST THERE IS NO EXPECTATION WHEN AN INDIVIDUAL WALKS INTO THE LOBBY OF THE POLICE DEPARTMENT. THAT THAT INDIVIDUAL THE PUBLIC OR MEMBER OF THE PRESS IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO WALTZ THROUGH THE ENTIRE DEPARTMENT- IT'S JUST WON'T HAPPEN. SAME THING WITH THIS COMMAND POST- AND- INDIVIDUALS WHETHER IT'S A MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC OR THE PRESS WILL NOT BE GIVEN UNFETTERED ACCESS. AND IN FACT- THE POLICE HAVE THE FULL ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO SAY. THAT AND NUMBER THE PUBLIC OR THE PRESS NOT ALLOWED INTO THE COMMAND POST- SAME THING AS IT WOULD BE DONE YES IT IS. SO YOU FEEL THIS IS ALREADY COVERED AND YOU DON'T NEED TO BE MORE EXPLICIT ABOUT IT- WELL- THEN I'M GOING TO MOVE THE BILL. THANK THERE'S A SECOND OKAY THANK YOU I'LL BE VOTING FOR THE BILL THANK YOU SO MUCH AND THEY WERE VERY GRATEFUL. SOMEONE ELSE LIKE TO ON THE COMMITTEE LIKE TO SPEAK MISTER SHARAPOVA TWENTY. SO THE ANY NEW SERVICE. H. AWAY WRITING A NEWSLETTER DECIDED THEY WANTED TO GET IN ON SOME OF THIS MAY GO DOWN THERE AND TELL YOU I'M I'M A NEWS PERSON FOR THE H. AWAY. DO THEY GET TO GO IN. I KNOW THAT WE WANT TO GO DOWN THE ROAD JUST BEING CANDID ABOUT HYPOTHETICALS- BUT WE'RE GONNA BE TALKING ABOUT HYPOTHETICAL SO I'M I'M HAPPY- AS A MEMBER TO BE ABLE TO HEAR YOUR POINT- I'VE HEARD THIS POINT JUST BEING HONEST FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS OF WHAT IF WHAT IF- BUT IT IS A HYPOTHETICAL AT THIS POINT LET'S TALK ABOUT IT LET'S TALK ABOUT SOMETHING AND I'LL GIVE YOU LIKE WHAT WHAT WHAT TEN TWENTY WITH RIGHT NOW THAT'S A REAL. IS THAT WE HAVE JOURNALISTS HAVE BEEN DETAINED OVER SIX HUNDRED JOURNALISTS IN THE YEAR OF LAST YEAR WERE EITHER DETAINED. ASSAULTED OR ATTACKED. SO THAT'S WHERE THE ISSUE THAT I FEEL THAT WE NEED TO BE FOCUSING ON IT IS A HYPOTHETICAL IN THIS STATE THAT AN INDIVIDUAL BASED OFF OF PRIOR EXPERIENCE IS GOING TO FAKE THAT THEY ARE A MEMBER OF THE MEDIA SO I I'M I'M- HAPPY TO CONTINUE TO HAVE THIS OKAY NINE POINT IS ANYBODY WITH A CAMERA CAN CLAIM THEY ARE PART OF A NEWS SERVICE OF SOME SORT. AND GO INTO AN AREA THAT IS AN INCIDENT COMMANDER YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR. AS AN ELIGIBLE% FOR THE SAFETY WHEN I'M IN INCIDENT COMMANDER I'M RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SAFETY. OF EVERYBODY IN THE AREA. AND IF I'M TRYING TO CLEAR OUT AN AREA. BECAUSE THERE ARE SOME TYPE OF DANGER OR ITS ESCALATING INTO SOMETHING ELSE. WHAT HAPPENS TO THOSE PEOPLE. IS MY RESPONSIBILITY. AND IF I HAVE A SOMEBODY WHO SAYS THEY'RE PART OF A NEW SERVICE GOING IN. AND USING THAT TO STAY IN AN AREA AND THEN THEY GET HURT. WELL GUESS WHO'S NOT WHO GUESSES ON HOPE FOR THAT. THE INCIDENT COMMANDER IN THE AGENCY THAT THEY REPRESENT THE INCIDENT COMMANDER STILL HAS THE OPPORTUNITY UNDER THIS BILL TO BE ABLE TO GO UP AND ASK AN INDIVIDUAL TO LEAVE RIGHT WELL I CAN TELL YOU IS AN IN THAT WHEN YOU'RE IN AN INCIDENT COMMAND POSITION. YOU DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO GO THROUGH A CROWD AND START PICKING OUT PEOPLE THAT ASKING QUESTIONS YOU'RE JUST HAVING YOU GIVE THE ORDER TO GO CLEAR THE AREA. AND IF THAT AREAS NOT BEING CLEARED OR PEOPLE ARE BEING INTERVIEWED AND SO THEY'RE NOT CLEARING THAT CREATES A PROBLEM SO THERE IS A RETIRED FIRE CHIEF AND I'M GRATEFUL FOR YOUR SERVICE SIR- JUST FYI THIS SIMPLY RESORTS BACK TO CURRENT LAW SO WHEN THERE IS A FIRE AND EARTHQUAKE- I NASH AND NATURAL DISASTER. THERE IS UNFETTERED ACCESS EVEN DURING CURFEW FOR PRESS ZERO READY HAVE THAT THEY THEY DO BUT THEY DON'T HAVE A DURING THE FIRST AMENDMENT DEMONSTRATION IN THAT SAME IF SIMPLY REVERTS BACK TO WHAT'S ALREADY UNLOCK RIGHT IN FOR IT THAT'S RIGHT IT IS THE LAW ALREADY THAT THEY HAVE ACCESS IN SAFE LOCATIONS DETERMINED BY THE INCIDENT COMMANDER. THIS CHALLENGES THAT. WHEN YOU'RE IN THIS IS IT IS NOT A FIRST AMENDMENT EXERCISE AT THE POINT WHERE THEY'RE SAYING. YOU MUST DISBURSE NOW IT IS NOW THEY'RE TRYING TO PREVENT A RIOT. SITUATION OR- OR UNCONTROLLED CROWD. IN AN ADDON CONTROL CROWD IF IT DOESN'T DISBURSING IT STARTS. BEING MORE VIOLENT THAT'S WHEN THEY BREAK OUT THE OTHER MEASURES THAT EVERYBODY IS AGAINST. WHICH ARE LIKE RUBBER BULLETS AND THINGS LIKE THAT TO DISPERSE THEM. AND THEN WHEN PEOPLE GET HURT. BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT DISBURSED THEN GET TO GET BLANKED THE AGENCY THE OFFICER THAT THE INCIDENT COMMANDER WHOEVER IT IS. THE WAY WE HAVE IT NOW. ALREADY HAD IT HAS FLAWS BUT THIS IS GOING TO HELP REINFORCE THOSE FLAWS IN AND THAT'S WHY I'M OPPOSED TO IT THANK EIGHT EDGY IN JUST MISTER BASED HERE IT DOESN'T CHALLENGE THAT THIS SIMPLY EXTENDS ACCESS OF FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHT OF THE PRESS TWO DEMONSTRATIONS I JUST WANNA BE VERY CLEAR I KNOW THAT THERE MAY BE SOME DIFFERENCES OF OPINION IN REGARDS TO- UNFETTERED ACCESS- IN DULY AUTHORIZED BUT- I WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT DOESN'T CHANGE THE LAW THAT'S CURRENTLY IN PLACE THIS THIS BILL. AGAIN MISTER SOME NUMBER I JUST WANNA SAY THANK YOU AGAIN. FOR YOUR SERVICE ESPECIALLY IN FIRE SERVICER. THIS PARKING. THANK YOU MR VICE CHAIR AND I JUST WANT TO THANK MR BUYERS CENTER WIRE FOR THIS WORK I MEAN HE'S BEEN AT IT FOR AWHILE. REACHING HEARING THIS BILL THE SECOND TIME. IN THE REFORM- BUT I THINK THAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE SEE TODAY MORE THAN IN MY WHOLE LIFE IS JUST THE QUESTION OF. WHAT IS TRUE AND WHAT IS HAPPENING OUT THERE AND WHERE DOES THE TRUTH LIE AND- THESE AS DEFINED IN THIS BILL DO WE AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVES OF THE NEW SERVICE ARE THERE TO PROVIDE US WITH THE TRUTH. AND ACCESS TO INFORMATION OF WHAT IS HAPPENING. IN AREAS OF INCIDENTS AND I THINK THAT IS SUCH A CRITICAL WORK THAT YOUR EFFORT TO PROTECT IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT INTO YOUR POINT. THE CONSTITUTION ALREADY PROTECTS IT. OF AND WITH THIS IS JEFF TAKE A STEP FURTHER TO ENSURE THAT THOSE PROTECTIONS ARE MEANINGFUL SO- I'M EXCITED TO SUPPORT IT IT'S ALREADY BEEN MOVED SO I WON'T. THANK YOU SIMILAR. VERY GRATEFUL OKAY I WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK TO. I'M GLAD THEY'RE- THANK YOU SO MUCH SIR THANK YOU I JUST GUESS EIGHT I THANK THE SENATOR FOR TO WORK ON THIS AND HOPEFULLY THIS TIME IT DOES GET THE SIGNATURE OF THE GOVERNOR BECAUSE I THINK IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT. AND I THINK WHAT THIS BILL SIGNIFIES. THE IMPORTANCE OF OPEN AND FREE MEDIA AND ALSO INTERESTING OF THE HAVING THE TRUTH IN THE WORLD I THINK I REALLY INVITE MY COLLEAGUES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE TO REALLY CONTEMPLATE THIS YOU KNOW THE THINGS WE ALWAYS CHASTISE OTHER COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD WHEN THEY WERE THERE POLICE GO BEAT UP THE MEDIA AND HIDE THINGS FROM THEM THAT HAPPENED HERE THAT DOES HAPPEN HERE IN OUR STATE AND OUR NATION. AND WE CANNOT HIDE THE TRUTH FROM THE PEOPLE ESPECIALLY WHEN IT IS PLEASE RETALIATES SELF WHEN THEY SCARE OFF JOURNALISTS WITH TIVIDALE ARREST THEM THAT'S THE KIND OF THINGS WE SEE IN OTHER COUNTRIES MORE AUTHORITARIAN COUNTRIES WE DECRY AND TO HOLD OURSELVES ACCOUNTABILITY IS TO PROTECT OUR DEMOCRACY THAT'S ARE REALLY CLOSE TO BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL I'M GLAD FOR YOUR WORK ON IT THANK YOU THAT A LITTLE PERSPECTIVE TO- SOME OF THOSE REMARKS THAT WERE JUST MADE THAT THERE ARE TACTICALLY SENSITIVE AREAS THAT NEED TO BE GUARDED AGAINST- FOR THE SAFETY OF THE PUBLIC. AND I THINK THAT'S BEEN OVER NOT IN. IT'S NOT A HARPER. SENATOR IF I GET THIS TO COME BACK UP IN YOUR BILL. IT DOES STATE FIRST OF ALL YOUR SECTION. THAT- THE PRESS WOULD HAVE. UNFETTERED ACCESS TO EMERGENCY FIELD COMMAND POST IT SAYS THAT IN YOUR BILL. AND I FIND THAT TO BE VERY VERY TROUBLING. BECAUSE MANY OF THOSE COMMAND POST THEY TALK ABOUT HIGHLY SENSITIVE AREAS- THAT ARE PART OF THE OPERATION PROTECTING THE PUBLIC. AND ALSO STATES. IN YOUR- LANGUAGE OF YOUR BILL. THAT ANY A DULY AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE ANY NEW SERVICE ONLINE NEWS SERVICE NEWSPAPER. OR RADIO OR TELEVISION STATION OR NETWORK MAKE ENTERED THE CLOSED AREA. DESCRIBED AND SOLD IT DOESN'T LIKE THAT EXAMPLE THAT AT LEAST IT'S BIT MISLEADING TO SAY THAT WHEN YOU GO INTO A BUILDING YOU CAN HAVE ACCESS TO THE- ENTIRE. STATION HERE IT SAYS YOU CAN ENTER WITHIN THE CLOSED ACT. SECTION AND SO. THERE'S NO REGARD FOR TACTICALLY SENSITIVE AREAS. AND I THINK THAT. THE OTHER ISSUE THAT'S BEEN DISCUSSED THE AMBIGUITY ORDER- THE AMBIGUITY OVER THE OFFICER'S ABILITY TO RECOGNIZE ON A ORDER TO DISPERSE. I WISH THAT THE PEOPLE ON THIS COMMITTEE AND THOSE ARE ADVOCATING FOR THIS MEASURE. WOULD ACTUALLY EXPERIENCE A RIGHT AND UNDERSTAND HOW DIFFICULT AND HOW CHAOTIC SCENES ARE. AND THE OBLIGATION OF LAW ENFORCERS IS TO RESTORE ORDER AND TO TRY TO MAKE AN AREA SAFE BECAUSE VERY DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE WHO'S PRESSING WHO'S NOT PRESS WHEN YOU GIVE AN ORDER TO DISPERSE AND I FIND THAT TO BE VERY VERY TROUBLING AND THAT'S REASON I CAN'T SUPPORT THIS BILL. I'LL GIVE YOU THE OPPORTUNITY CLOSE IT THERE'S NO ONE ELSE ELECT SPEAK. YOU MAY CLOSER THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER VICE CHAIR- I. AM VERY GRATEFUL IN RESPECT THE VICE CHAIR HIS PROFESSION IN LINE OF WORK PRIOR TO BEING- IN THE LEGISLATURE OBVIOUSLY WAS SERVING THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA- WITH THE CHP. I'M THE ONLY NINE POLICE OFFICER MY FAMILY. THE ONLY ONE- AND I UNDERSTAND THE CONCERN THIS BILL LITERALLY WOULD MIRROR WHAT'S ALREADY IN EXISTING LAW. NUMBER TWO UNFETTERED ACCESS PRESS RIGHT NOW HAVE UNFETTERED ACCESS TO A POLICE STATION. NOT BEYOND THE LOBBY LET'S TALK COMMON SENSE OF COURSE THEY'RE NOT GONNA GET INTO A CONFIDENTIAL AREA IN I WANT TO END IT WITH THE NUMBERS. FORTY NINE ARRESTS AND DETAINMENT THUS FAR IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE A PRESS THE DEMONSTRATIONS. RIGHT NINE JOURNALISTS- AND NEWS ORGANIZATIONS HAVE BEEN SUBPOENAED. SEVENTY FIVE JOURNALISTS WERE ASSAULTED IN TWENTY TWO JOURNALISTS HAD THEIR EQUIPMENT DAMAGED I'M ALL BY LAW ENFORCEMENT I'M GOING TO BE THE FIRST TO SAY THIS IS A SMALL MINORITY A SMALL MINORITY OF THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO MAKE UP THE RANKS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THE STATE IN THIS NATION. AND WE HAVE A CONSTITUTION FOR A REASON AND ONE OF THE CORNERSTONES OF THE COURT'S CONSTITUTION IS THE FREEDOM OF THE PRESS AND THE FIRST AMENDMENT RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN IPHONE. THANK YOU CENTER AND I BELIEVE THE CHAIR HAS A DO% PASS RECOMMENDATION. THAT THERE'S NO FURTHER COMMENT WILL CALL FOR THE QUESTION. SB NINETY EIGHT BY SENATOR REQUIRE THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER. LACKEY NO LACKING NO BARRICADE HALF. PARA QUE HAN HI LEE. LEE HI CORK BY CORK I SAN DIEGO. SAN DIEGO I SEE YOUR ACCOUNT NOW THE R. TEN NOW WICKS. THAT'S A LONG ONE THANK YOU SIR. THANK YOU. PORTANTINO YOU RIGHT NOW. ADRESS COMMITTEE. SB SEVEN FIFTEEN I BELIEVE YES SIR. SECOND. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS AND THANK YOU FOR THAT QUICK MOTION TODAY I'M PRESENTING SB SEVEN FIFTEEN THE BILL THAT THIS COMMITTEE HAS SEEN BEFORE IN VARIOUS FORMS- WERE ACQUIRED A DEPARTMENT JUST TO VERIFY THE VALIDITY OF HUNTING LICENSE WHEN A PERSON UNDER THE AGE OF TWENTY ONE IS USING THE LICENSE TO PURCHASE FIREARMS UNDER CURRENT LAW AND TRANSFERRING OR PURCHASING A FIREARM WITHOUT A HUNTING LICENSE THERE'S NO VERIFICATION PROCESS WE RECENTLY SAW HOW THAT BREAK DOWN IN COMMUNICATION- LED TO THE HOW A SYNAGOGUE SHOOTING WHERE A TEENAGER WAS ABLE TO PURCHASE A FIREARM EVEN THOUGH THAT TEENAGER HAD AND- INVALID HUNTING LICENSE THIS BILL SEEKS TO CORRECT THAT SITUATION. IT ALSO DEALS WITH AN EXPANSION OF THE GOOD WORK OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY AND DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATIONS WHEN POLICE SHOOT AN UNARMED IT SHOULDN'T KILL AN UNARMED PERSON UNFORTUNATELY THAT BILL- DID NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT WHEN THERE'S A DISPUTE OVER WHETHER THERE IS A WEAPON AND THAT RECENTLY HAPPENED IN PASADENA WHERE GERMAN GOT OUT OF A CAR WAS SHOT AND BOTH THE FAMILY AND THE POLICE ARE ARGUING ABOUT WHETHER THERE WAS A PRESENCE OF A WEAPON THIS BILL WOULD LET THERE BE AN INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION IF THERE'S A CREDIBLE REASONABLE ARGUMENT OR DISCUSSION OR DISPUTE. OVER THE PRESENCE OF A WEAPON SO WITH THOSE TWO PIECES OF IT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. CAN WE DO. SEVENTY SUPPORT WINDOWS I DON'T THINK WE ARE WHEN IS HERE IF ANYBODY HAS TO NEED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE OKAY AND I KNOW HOW MUCH THIS COMMITTEE VALUES ARE ONCE PRESENCE SO WE WANTED TO BRING HIM BACK JUST FOR ASSEMBLY MEMBER. OUR K. AND. AS ANYBODY. ELSE IN THE ROOM THAT WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK TO THIS ISSUE- OR NEAR WELCOME TO ENLIGHTEN US IF YOU SO WISH OR HOW MY GOD. CAN'T THE NOVICES OF CANTON I WANT TO- WENT HERE FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE YEAH I JUST WANNA MAKE A POINT BECAUSE THE CONTROVERSY ON THIS BILL IS ABOUT MINORS. THE WAR ON THIS AS TO LONG GUNS IS A MAX AND THERE ARE DIFFERING OPINIONS. ON WHAT AND IS WHAT IS AND WHAT IS NOT ALLOWED WHAT THIS BILL TRIES TO DO IS BASED ON WHAT THE BEST UNDERSTANDING THE LAW IS. TO MAKE THE STATUTES CONSISTENT. WITHOUT ATTACKING C. R. PA IT'S PRESENT IN HIS BOOK WHICH- IS THERE BY. MAKE CERTAIN ASSERTIONS WHICH- ARE MUCH MORE RESTRICTIVE OF CURRENT LAW THEN THE GIFFORDS CAMPAIGN IN ITS BOOKS. SAYS AND AS A RESULT OF THAT TRYING TO GET TO AN EQUAL POINT WHERE MINORS CAN. HAUNT THAN DO THOSE OTHER THINGS WITHOUT HAVING UNRESTRICTED ON TRACTABLE SITUATIONS INVOLVING LONG GUNS AND MINERS IS WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT THE CAME UP BECAUSE OF THE HUNTING LICENCES ISSUE A COUPLE YEARS AGO WHERE IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THIS AREA OF THE LAW WAS A MASS AND WE'RE JUST TRYING TO. DO WHAT WE THINK IS COMMON SENSE AND WE WORK WITH THE VARIOUS HUNTING GROUPS ON THIS AND THEY ARE NOT OPPOSED TO THIS BILL OKAY THANK YOU SIR.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN ROY GRIFFIN SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA RIFLE PISTOL SOLICITATION ARE THIRTY SOME THOUSAND MEMBERS ROCK CALIFORNIA MANY OF YOU KNOW I MEAN OUR THIRTY TWO YEARS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT THE LAST TEN YEARS OF MY CAREER MY JOB WAS REVIEWING LEGISLATION AS IT IMPACTED THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA PARTICULAR DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE SO I'VE NEVER PROFESSED TO BE THE SHARPEST TOOL IN THE SHED BUT I HAVE REVIEWED LEGISLATION OVER THE YEARS. AND I'VE NEVER FACED ANYTHING IS CONVOLUTED AND JUST TWIST THIS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION OUR GOAL AND INSTALL RESPECT TO THIS DYESS AND ALL THE FOLKS ON THE DIESS IS TO MAKE LEGISLATION RULES THAT PEOPLE CAN UNDERSTAND AND FOLLOW THIS ONE MAKE SURE HEAD SPIN AND STARTED OUT WITH A GOOD IDEA JUST MAYBE FIGURE OUT WHAT I NEED A LAWFUL FISHING OR HUNTING LICENCES. TWENTY SEVEN YEARS OF THE GAME WARDEN I NEVER NEEDED A DATABASE TO COST MULTIMILLION. WE CAN APARTMENT FISHING WILDLIFE. AND APARTMENT A JUSTICE TO TELL ME WHAT A VALID HUNTING LICENCES I JUST WAS ABLE TO. PICK UP A LICENSE LOOK AT THE ISSUE DATE OR THE EXPIRATION DATE AND THAT WAS GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME. THIS TRAGEDY IN SAN DIEGO. WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO THE SENATOR. THIS BILL WOULD NOT CHANGE THAT THANK YOUNG TWISTED INDIVIDUAL JUST HAD TO IT WHO WAS TOLD SHE HAD BEEN TOLD THAT LICENSE WAS NOT VALID. BECAUSE HE BOUGHT NEXT YEAR'S LICENSE. ONLY HAD TO DO WAS WALK BACK INTO BIG FIVE. BY THIS YEAR'S LICENSE GO BACK INTO A GUN STORE THAT GOT TWISTED INDIVIDUAL COULD HAVE DID WHAT HE DID. OR COULD WAITED TWO WEEKS TOLD LICENSE WAS VALID AND THEN. PURCHASE THAT FAR. SO WITH ALL DUE RESPECT WE STAND IN STRONG OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL LET'S MAKE LEGISLATION OF X. RULES THAT ARE. THAT CAN BE UNDERSTOOD. AND FOLLOWED AND NOT JUST MAKE THE BOOK EVEN MORE COMPLICATED THANK. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS APPARATUS- ON BEHALF OF GUN OWNERS OF CALIFORNIA AND- THE NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION. WHAT I HAVE HERE IN MY HAND IS A- EXPIRED CALIFORNIA HUNTING LICENSE ON TAMPER PROOF- MATERIAL THAT IS ISSUED EVERY TIME SOMEBODY BUYS A HUNTING LICENSE RIGHT AT THE TOP IT SAYS VALID. 081-720-2206 THIRTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THERE IS NO NEED AT AND WE AGREE WITH THE GOVERNOR EVEN THOUGH A- HIGH GRADE FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION HAS BEEN SET FOR TWO POINT TWENTY FIVE. THERE IS NO NEED TO SPEND THAT KIND OF MONEY ANDTHE RESOURCES AND THE PERSONNEL THE P. WHY YOU'RE GOING TO BE REQUIRED. TO OPERATE A SYSTEM SO THAT EVERY TIME- SOMEONE NEEDS TO VERIFY A HUNTING LICENSE TO PURCHASE. FOR PURCHASING A FIREARM THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE SYSTEM. IT'S NOT NECESSARY THAT THAT IS A MASSIVE WASTE OF GOVERNMENT RESOURCES ANOTHER PROBLEM WE HAVE WITH THIS BILL IS THAT IT ALLOWS. FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TO CHARGE ADDITIONAL FEES- ON TOP OF THE- AMMUNITION AND PRECURSOR PARTS- LAST I SAW IT WAS OWNED BY THE WAY MR ONE. THE BIBLE IS MY BIBLE NOT SHOP WHICH SELLS BOOK SO- WORD STRONG OPPOSITION OFTENTIMES WE CALL THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND ASK THEM A QUESTION ABOUT A STATUTE THAT WAS PASSED AND SIGNED INTO LAW. AND WHAT IT MEANS AND HOW IT AFFECTS PEOPLE AND YOU KNOW WHAT THEY TELL US. A 100% OF THE TIME. CALL YOUR LAWYER. WELL WE CALLED OUR LAWYERS AND WE'VE ASKED THEM TO TAKE A LOOK AT THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION AND THEIR EYES ARE SWIMMING TRYING TO FIGURE OUT EVERYTHING ALL OF THE NUANCES ALL OF WHAT OF WHAT THIS MEANS IS HOW THIS IS GOING TO AFFECT PEOPLE. CALIFORNIA'S LAWS ALREADY CONFUSING ENOUGH AND THIS IS GONNA THROW THEM IN THE TERM ALL WE RESPECTFULLY ASK YOU TO OPPOSE THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. IT WOULD ANYONE ELSE IN FORTY TWO OH TWO- IN OPPOSITION WILL GO TO THE TELECONFERENCE LINE. NOT VERY DID OKAY I'M SO ARE WE NOW BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE I'M ALL CAUGHT UP NOW. WHO HAS A QUESTION CONCERNED COMMENT SEEING NONE YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I LIKE IT WHEN YOU'RE ALL CAUGHT UP. IF NOT YOU KNOW. THIS BILL IS BEEN THROUGH THIS COMMITTEE. I RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE WITH THE OPPOSITION. WE NEED TO DO EVERYTHING TO MAKE CALIFORNIA SAFE WE NEED TO DO EVERYTHING. WE CAN TO KEEP GUNS OUT OF THE WRONG HANDS- THIS BODY HAS SUPPORTED THOSE EFFORTS IN THE PAST- IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT THIS CONVERSATION GETS LOST I MEAN I FEEL LIKE SOMETIMES IF. THERE IS A BILL THAT SAYS YOU CAN'T BRING A BAZOOKA INTO FIRST GRADE PEOPLE WOULD OPPOSE IT BECAUSE THEY WOULD SAY IT WAS AN INFRINGEMENT. YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO BE REASONABLE WE HAVE TO TAKE PRUDENT STEPS AND I THINK THIS BILL TAKES PRUDENT STEPS IN BOTH AREAS. BOTH IN THE CONTINUATION OF ASSEMBLY MCCARTY SEPARATE AND THEN ALSO TO KEEP WEAPONS OUT OF THE HANDS OF THOSE FOLKS WHO DON'T HAVE ALLEN HUNTING LICENCES AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. IS USER BEEN A MOTION AND SECOND. OKAY THE JURORS RECOMMEND HIGH CALL THE ROLL. AND SB SEVEN FIFTEEN BY CENTER PORTANTINO THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER CONSIDER IRAQI LACKEY NOT VOTING BARRACK HE HAD BACKING AND I LEVY WE ARE A CORK HI MARK I SANTIAGO. C. R. TELL NO THEY ARE TURNOUT WICKS. BILLS ON CALL NEEDS ONE MORE THANK YOU THANK YOU. I BELIEVE WE ONLY HAVE TWO MORE PILLS AND I WE HAVE WANTED THE AUTHOR HERE'S SENATOR MA'AM. S. B. EIGHT SIX TWO FOUR MEN FIREARMS STATE PROPERTY SIX PEOPLE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I RISE TO PRESENT TO U. S. B. TWO SIXTY FOUR WHICH WILL ENSURE THAT THE STATE IS NOT PROFITING FROM THE SALE OF FIREARMS AMMUNITION AND FIREARM PRECURSOR PARTS ALSO KNOWN AS GHOST GUNS. OF ON STATE PROPERTY OR BY FACILITATING GUN SHOWS THAT COULD UNDERMINE CALIFORNIA STRONG FIREARM REGULATIONS. EARLY LAST YEAR YOU MAY REMEMBER THE WEEKEND WHEN WE HAD THE EL PASO SHOOTINGS- THAT WEEKEND WE HAD EXPLAINED THAT MY YOUNG CHILDREN. NOT YET AGAIN ABOUT THE TRAGEDIES AND DANGERS OF GUN VIOLENCE IN THIS COUNTRY- THE NEXT MORNING SUNDAY MORNING WE WOKE UP TO LEARN THERE'S BEEN ANOTHER MASS SHOOTING IN DAYTON OHIO- THIS IS PERSONAL TO ME BECAUSE MY WIFE HAS FAMILY IN DAYTON. AND A NUMBER OF COUSINS WHO ATTENDED THE UNIVERSITY OF DAYTON AND THEN ACTUALLY FREQUENT IN THE BAR WHERE THE SHOOTING TOOK PLACE. WE TO MAKE A NUMBER OF ANXIOUS PHONE CALLS THAT MORNING TO FAMILY TO MAKE SURE THAT SURE THEY'RE ALL OK. LUCKILY FOR US- THEY WERE. AS IT HAPPENED ON THAT MORNING THEIR SCHEDULE DO A FAMILY FUN RUN FIVE K. ON OUR LOCAL ORANGE COUNTY FAIRGROUNDS. AS WE PASSED THE FINISH LINE ALL OF US INCLUDING MY THEN EIGHT YEAR OLD SIX YEAR OLD AND THREE YEAR OLD. WERE HANDED FLYERS OFFERING US FREE ADMISSION TO THE GUN SHOWS HAPPENING THE FOLLOWING WEEKEND. NOW WHEN I WAS GROWING UP THE COUNTY FAIRGROUNDS WERE KNOWN FOR BEING FAMILY FRIENDLY. IN ADDITION TO THE COUNTY FAIR EACH YEAR THAT HAVE RODEOS THINGS LIKE FOUR H. EVENTS CONCERTS CIRCUSES. AND OTHER FAMILY FRIENDLY FARE. BUT TODAY GUN SHOWS IN THE CITY CAL I MEAN SORT COUNTY FAIRGROUNDS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. ARE KNOWN PRIMARILY FOR GUNSHOWS. THE AVERAGE COUNTY FAIRGROUNDS ACROSS THE STATE HOSTS FIVE GUN SHOWS A YEAR. MEINE ORANGE COUNTY TYPICALLY HOSTS EIGHT TO TWELVE GUN SHOWS EACH YEAR. AND CONTRARY TO THE CLAIMS OF PROPONENTS OF THESE GUN SHOWS. THEY'RE ANYTHING BUT FAMILY FRIENDLY. IF YOU'VE EVER BEEN TO ONE OF THESE YOU'LL KNOW THAT THEIR HOT BEDS OF EXTREMIST SENTIMENT. IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR T. SHIRTS EMBLAZONED WITH- A NOT SO SUBTLE VEILED THREATS AGAINST POLITICIANS- WITH A LOT OF F. BOMBS AND OTHER- OBSCENE LANGUAGE. THIS IS THE PLACE TO GO. AT THAT TIME I WAS RUNNING FOR THIS SEAT I NOW HOLD AND IF I VOWED THAT IF I ENDED UP BEING ELECTED I WOULD WORK TO END GUN SHOWS. ON SAY PROPERTY ORANGE COUNTY AND ACROSS THE STATE. I PROPONENTS OF THESE COUNTRIES CLAIM THAT THEY'RE SAFE AND DON'T SELL ANY ILLEGAL FIREARMS BUT THIS IS SIMPLY NOT TRUE. GUN SHOWS ARE SENSUALLY A FLEA MARKET FOR FIREARMS THEIR PRIMARY MECHANISM BY WHICH UNLICENSED UNREGISTERED AND ILLEGAL FIREARMS. OR TRAFFIC THROUGH SECONDARY MARKETS. MY STAFF AND I ATTENDED A GUN SHOW-IN THE DISTRICT A FEW MONTHS AGO AND WHILE THEY'RE WAITING IN LINE TO GET IN THEY WERE INUNDATED WITH OFFERS TO PURCHASE DIFFERENT TYPES OF WEAPONS BY PEOPLE WORKING THE LINES. AND THIS IS NOT UNIQUE TO MY STAFF ORANGE COUNTY. ACCORDING TO GIFFORDS LAW CENTER TO PREVENT GUN VIOLENCE. GUN SHOWS OFTEN CREATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO CIRCUMVENT GUN SAFETY LAWS AND ARE COMMON VENUE FOR STRAW PURCHASES AND LEGAL GUN TRANSFERS. AN ATF REPORT ALSO THIS HAS DESCRIBED GUN SHOWS AS A MAJOR TRAFFICKING CHANNEL. FOUND THE GUN SHOWS WERE THE SECOND LARGEST SOURCE OF ILLEGALLY TRAFFICKED FIREARMS. IT'S WORTH NOTING THAT WHILE I WISH I COULD CITE MORE STATISTICS UNITED STATES SIGNIFICANT RESTRICTS LAW ENFORCEMENT'S ABILITY TO INVESTIGATE GUN CRIMES AND PROSECUTE DO THAT HI HOW ARE AMENDMENTS. IT IS WIDELY BELIEVED THOUGH THAT GUN SHOWS ARE MAJOR CONDUIT PERHAPS THE MAJOR CONDUIT NOT ONLY FOR THESE ON LICENSE AND LEGAL GUNS BUT ALSO FOR THE SALE OF GHOST GUNS. PRECURSOR GUN PARTS DESIGNED TO BE ASSEMBLED INTO A WORKING FIREARM. BECAUSE THESE GHOST GUNS ARE NOT TECHNICALLY FIREARMS THEY DON'T HAVE SERIAL NUMBERS AND ARE NOT REGISTERED AT THE TIME OF SALE. IN THE WHEN I VISITED GUN SHOW A FEW MONTHS AGO THE MOST POPULAR VENDORS BY FAR WITH ONE SELLING GHOST GUN KITS. DESIGNED TO TURN IN A FIREARMS AKIN TO GLOCK PISTOLS AND A R. FIFTEEN RIFLES. THEY WERE THEY COULD BE PURCHASED CASHIN KERRY AND TAKEN RIGHT OFF OF THE LOT. BUT I WILL ALSO SUBMIT TO YOU THAT EVEN IF THEY WERE ZERO SALES OF ILLEGAL OR UNLICENSED GUNS. OR GHOST GUNS. WE SHOULD STILL SUPPORT THIS BILL. AND THAT IS BECAUSE GUN SHOWS ARE DESIGNED FOR ONE PURPOSE. TO SELL GUNS IN OUR COMMUNITIES. AND THEY ARE INCREDIBLY EFFECTIVE AT THAT PURPOSE. AND THIS IS SUCH A DEADLY DEADLY PROBLEM. AS STUDY AFTER STUDY HAS SHOWN. MORE GUNS MEANS MORE GUN VIOLENCE. YOU CAN LOOK THIS UP THE HARVARD HARVARD BUREAU OF INJURY CONTROL- JOURNAL INTERCOLLEGIATE STUDIES AND MANY OTHER STUDIES. COUNTRIES WITH MORE GUNS HAVE MORE GUN VIOLENCE. STATES WITH MORE GUNS HAVE MORE GUN VIOLENCE. HOUSEHOLDS WITH MORE GUNS ARE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE GUN VIOLENCE. NOW SINCE THAT WEEKEND WHEN WE HAD THE EL PASO IN DAYTON SHOOTINGS THAT WEEKEND WHEN I VOWED TO END GUN SHOWS. IN THE STATE AND COUNTY FAIRGROUNDS WE'VE HAD HUNDREDS OF MASS SHOOTINGS. INCLUDING THE MASS SHOOTING PREVIOUSLY IN SAN JOSE. THE MASS SHOOTING IN ORANGE IN MY DISTRICT EARLIER THIS YEAR. OVER FIFTY THOUSAND AMERICANS HAVE LOST THEIR LIVES INCLUDING THE NINE VICTIMS OF THE RECENT MASS SHOOTING IN SAN JOSE. THE SHOOTINGS OF FOUR PEOPLE ANYONE SHOOTING I MENTIONED AND SIX YEAR OLD ETAN LEOS WHO WAS MURDERED IN MY DISTRICT BY SOMEONE WHO IS APPARENTLY HAVING ROAD RAGE ON THE FIFTY FIVE. EACH OF THESE VIOLENT DEATHS FOR A MASSIVE HOLE IN THEIR FAMILIES. IN THEIR COMMUNITIES AMONG THEIR LOVED ONES. NOW PROPONENTS OF GUN SHOWS ARGUE THAT ENDING GUN SHOWS WILL DEPRIVE THEM OF REVENUE BUT I WILL POINT OUT THAT THIS IS JUST A SMALL FRACTION OF THE REVENUE GENERATED BY THE FAIRGROUNDS. AND IT IS INDISPUTABLE THAT THE COSTS OF GUN VIOLENCE ARE ASTRONOMICALLY HIGHER. IN FACT- THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM ESTIMATED THE COST ANNUAL COSTS OF GUN VIOLENCE IN CALIFORNIA OR SIX POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR THAT IS EXPONENTIALLY MORE THAN THE REVENUE THE SMALL AMOUNT OF REVENUE THAT WE RECEIVED FROM THESE GUN SHOWS IN THE STATE. THE OPPOSITION ALSO CLAIMS THAT THIS BILL GOES TOO FAR AND THAT WE SHOULD LEAVE THIS UP TO COUNTY FAIRGROUNDS. AS A MATTER OF LOCAL CONTROL. THAT WOULD BE GREAT IF IT AS TRUE BUT IF YOU TALK TO BOARD MEMBERS OF COUNTY FAIRGROUNDS. THEY WILL TELL YOU THEY HAVE NO FIDUCIARY DUTIES TO THE LOCAL COMMUNITY. THEIR SOLE FIDUCIARY DUTY LIES WITH ENSURING THE SOLVENCY THERE DROUGHT FAIRGROUNDS AND MAXIMIZING REVENUE. AS THEY WILL TELL YOU THEY'RE OBLIGATED TO CONTRACT WITH GUN SHOW OPERATORS NO MATTER WHAT THE PREFERENCES OF LOCAL COMMUNITY. AND THAT THEREFORE THE ONLY SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM IS SAY REGULATION. I ALSO WANT TO PUSH BACK ON THIS OR EVEN A LOCAL CONTROL AS A MATTER OF PRINCIPLE BECAUSE THERE ARE MANY INSTANCES WHERE WE DECIDE THERE ARE CERTAIN STATEWIDE VALUES. THAT WE WANT TO PROMOTE REGARDLESS OF WHAT LOCALS MAY THINK. WE REQUIRE THAT CHILDREN BE VACCINATED REQUIRES THAT WORKPLACES BE SAFE FROM DANGEROUS CONDITIONS OR SEXUAL HARASSMENT OR ASSAULT. REQUIRE THE CERTAIN HEALTH ND LABOR STANDARDS BE MET. AND WE DO THIS DESPITE THE FACT THAT SOME LOCAL JURISDICTIONS MAY DISAGREE WITH OUR STATEWIDE STANDARDS AND MANDATES. WELL I THINK THIS IS AN IMPORTANT VALUE THAT WE'RE MAKING TODAY VALUE STATEMENT. WHAT WE'RE SAYING TODAY IS THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS NOT GOING TO CONTINUE SANCTIONING. AND ENDORSING THE DISTRIBUTION OF GUNS INTO OUR COMMUNITIES OUT OF STATE PROPERTY. NOW A NUMBER OF FOLKS HAVE ALSO RAISED THE SECOND AMENDMENT IS A CONCERN AND I JUST WANNA BE CLEAR. I BELIEVE THIS BILL IS ENTIRELY CONSISTENT WITH THE SECOND AMENDMENT. THIS IS NOT AFFECT THE RIGHT TO BEAR ARMS BY INDIVIDUALS- IT MERELY SAYS THAT THE STATE WILL NOT BE PART OF THAT DISSEMINATION OF GUNS IN OUR COMMUNITY. THE SECOND AMENDMENT EXISTS IN OUR CONSTITUTION IT ALLOWS FOR THE REASONABLE REGULATION OF GUNS- THE RIGHT TO BEAR ARMS. BUT THERE'S ALSO THE TENTH AMENDMENT THAT PRESERVES THE RIGHTS THOSE RIGHTS OF THE STATES. THAT ARE NOT EXPLICITLY RESERVE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND CERTAINLY IT IS WITHIN THE AUSPICES THE TENTH AMENDMENT TO SAY THAT WE CAN DO WHAT WE WANT WITH OUR OWN. PROPERTY AND I THINK THAT THIS THE VIOLENCE THAT MENTION WHICH IS RAVAGING OUR STATE WEATHER IN. SANTA BARBARA SAN FRANCISCO OAKLAND SANTA ANA. SAN DIEGO COMPTON YUBA CITY STOCKTON ORANGE CITRUS HEIGHTS. SAN JOSE AND MANY OTHERS. GIVES US GOOD REASON TO MAKE THIS WHAT HAPPENED TO DRAW A LINE IN THE SAND. AND SAY THAT THE GREAT STATE OF CALIFORNIA WILL NOT PROFIT OFF THE SALE OF GUNS. IT WILL NOT AID IN DISSEMINATING MORE GUNS AND THE RESULTING GUN VIOLENCE IN OUR COMMUNITIES. WITH ME TODAY I'VE STEVE LANGLEY FORMER CHIEF OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE'S BUREAU FIREARMS. AND A MEMBER OF BRADY ORANGE COUNTY AS WELL AS CHARLIE BLACK. WHO IS PERSONALLY AFFECTED BY GUN VIOLENCE ALSO MEMBER BRADY ORANGE COUNTY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU JOHN YOU HAVE OF FIVE MINUTES TOTAL- WHOEVER MUST BEGIN FIRST. WELL GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS CHARLES BLACK. I'M A PAST PRESIDENT AND CURRENT BOARD MEMBER OF BRADY ORANGE COUNTY. WHO MY REPRESENTED. I AM RETIRED ATTORNEY THANK INTO THIS ISSUE FOR THE GUN DEATH OF MY SON. WE WISH TO THANK SATURDAY MAN FOR HIS PLEDGE TO ADDRESS THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE. WHY IN THE WORLD OR RE SUPPORTING GUN SHOWS THAT STATE OWNED PROPERTY THE TAXPAYERS MONEY WELL WE ARE DEALING WITH THE GRIEF OF GUN VIOLENCE VICTIMS IN COMMUNITIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA. WE BELIEVE THAT THE PURCHASE OF A FIREARM IS LITERALLY A GREAT DECISION AND SHOULD BE DONE IN A MORE APPROPRIATE SHETTY. PLAN SHOWS ARE A NOISY WITH OUR NOISY WITH A CARNIVAL LIKE ATMOSPHERE. THE MASS. SHOWING A FIREARMS AND THE PROMOTION OF SAYING THAT THESE EVENTS AT STATE OWNED PROPERTIES FOR FAMILY ENTERTAINMENT OFTEN TAKES PLACE CREATES THE APPEARANCE THE STATE GIVES THEM LESS OF THE PRINCIPAL OF SUCH SALES. CERTAINLY THE PRE ADMISSION OF OFTEN OFFERED HER CHILDREN TO ATTEND WITH A PARENT GIVES ONE PAUSE. PUBLISHED RESEARCH HAS BEEN AVAILABLE FOR YEARS AND BRINGING A FIREARM INTO THE HOME CONCRETIONS THE RISK OF SUICIDE HOMICIDE AND UNINTENTIONAL SHOOTINGS- THAT HOME. AND YET HERE WE ARE WITH THE GUN SHOWS AND LOCAL COMMUNITIES TO PROVIDE MASS SELLING THE FIREARMS AMMUNITION AND PRECURSOR FIREARMS. THE GENERAL PUBLIC ADDITIONALLY AND NOT PARADOXICALLY THE SAME TAXPAYERS PICK UP THE TAB OF SIX POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN ANNUAL COSTS OF GUN VIOLENCE IN CALIFORNIA THERE ENSUES. THEREFORE WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS THEN THE MASS SELLING AND PROMOTION OF FIREARMS PRECURSOR GUN PARTS AMMUNITION AMMUNITION ON STATE OWNED PROPERTIES THE STATE SHOULD NOT BE COMPLICIT WITH SUCH ACTIVITIES. THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

WOW MISTER CHAIR THERE'S NO OTHER PARTICIPANTS QUEUED UP AT THIS TIME OKAY WE NOW TO HEAR FROM OPPOSITION WITNESSES. IN THE INNER IN THE ROOM- RIGHT GRIFFIN'S CALIFORNIA RIFLE PISTOL ASSOCIATION IN PERSON AND SAMPRAS GUN OWNERS OF CALIFORNIA BOTH IN PERSON. MISTER CHAIRMAN SAMPRAS- EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF GUN OWNERS OF CALIFORNIAN ALSO REPRESENTING THE NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION AND IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO FIGURE OUT WHERE TO START FIRST OF ALL THE SENATOR- SHOULD I THINK REALIZE THAT THE- FAIRGROUNDS ARE NOT OWNED BY THE STATE THEY ARE OWNED BY ALL THE TAXPAYERS NOT JUST THE LOCAL TAXPAYERS BUT ALL THE TAXPAYERS OF UNITED OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO IF WE GO ALONG THE LINE THAT YOU'RE GOING WE SHOULD BE BANNING CAR SHOWS SINCE THEY ARE THE NUMBER ONE- THE MIRRORS OF GOAL OF GLOBAL WARMING WE SHOULD BE BANNING CONCERTS THAT HAVE OFFENSIVE LANGUAGE THAT HAVE- THAT ARE ARE ARE. ARE AT HELD AT THE SHOWS. THE ONLY FRIENDLY TO SOMEONE IT IS TO SOMEONE IT ISN'T- WITH REGARDS TO GUN SHOWS GUN SHOWS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHICH HAS BEEN PRESENTED. AND TESTIFY TO IN THIS COMMITTEE MANY TIMES FOR MANY YEARS. ARE THE SAFEST GUN SHOWS IN THE ENTIRE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE WOULD COME HERE IN THE PAST AND TESTIFIED. THAT THEY HAVE HAD AGENTS AT GUN SHOWS AND WE HAVEN'T HAD A CRIME COMMITTED IN A GUN SHOW IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IN A VERY LONG TIME ALL OF THE STUDIES THAT YOU THAT YOU MENTION NONE OF THEM REFER TO CALIFORNIA ANY INCIDENCES IN CALIFORNIA. NOT A SINGLE ONE AND THEY ARE. THEY ARE A FOR LACK OF BETTER TERMS EPIDEMIOLOGY LOGICAL. IN THE SENSE THAT THEY SHOW A CORRELATION OR ASSOCIATION BUT THEY DO NOT SHOW CAUSATION THAT'S LIKE SAYING THAT YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO INVESTIGATE FIREFIGHTERS BECAUSE THEY SHOW UP EVERY TIME THERE'S A FIRE THERE'S A FIREFIGHTER AROUND YES THERE'S A CORRELATION BUT THAT ISN'T THE COST THE SAME IS TRUE WITH THIS. ONE POINT TWO MILLION PEOPLE BOUGHT NEW PEOPLE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA PURCHASE FIREARMS BECAUSE THEY WANTED TO NOT BECAUSE THEY WERE FORCED TO BECAUSE THEY WANTED TO EVERY SALE AT A GUN SHOW GOES THROUGH EXACTLY THE SAME PROCESS THAT THEY GO THROUGH A BRICK AND MORTAR STORE. WHETHER IT'S FOR PRECURSOR PARTS AMMUNITION OR FIREARMS. THIS IS WAY TOO LONG WE HAVE SIGNIFICAN NIGHT- I THINK THE ANALYSIS DOES A PRETTY GOOD JOB OF POINTING OUT. SOME OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUES THAT YOU HAVEN'T IF YOU HAVEN'T HEARD OF MCDONALD VERSUS CHICAGO THAT'S A CASE THAT INCORPORATED THE SECOND AMENDMENT. AGAINST CITIES AND STATES WHICH IN ESSENCE TOOK IT OUT OF THE PURVIEW OF THE TENTH AMENDMENT.

IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE CALIFORNIA NOT TO THE NATION'S BROADEST WAS A LEGISLATION TO ENSURE REASONABLE BUSINESS PRACTICES AGAIN SHOWS THE SEMINAL TWO NINETY FIVE. THE CALIFORNIA ALL CHOIR AND TRANSFER THEGUN SHOWS MUST BE PROCESSED THROUGH A LICENSED FIREARM DEALER.

AND THEY'RE NOT THERE THESE INVESTIGATIONS TAKE TIME THEY COULD TAKE HOURS DAYS TO WEEKS AFTER FOUR CALIFORNIA. APARTMENT JUST ACTUALLY- MIXER CASE AND MAKE YOUR LAST. I THANK YOU FOR THE TIME TODAY THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK AND I ASK HER. AYE VOTE. THANK YOU- I BELIEVE WE'VE HEARD SOME AND I. NOW WILL BRING IT TO COMMITTEE FOR QUESTION COMMON. MISTER CLARK. MY FIRM BELIEF IS THAT A GUN IS THE MOST DANGEROUS THING YOU CAN HAVE IN YOUR HOUSE- THE MOST LIKELY USE OF A GUN IS TO pBY SUICIDE- OR ACCIDENT OR- THROUGH. AN ARGUMENT FOR EXAMPLE THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED TO MARVIN GAYE'S FATHER SHOT HIM IN THE HEART. AT ANY RATE SO I I'M DEFINITELY NOT PRO GUN BUT MY CONCERN ABOUT THIS BILL IS ALL YOU'RE DOINGIS MOVING THEM OFF THE COUNTY FAIRGROUNDS TO SOMEWHERE ELSE- I WOULD BE MUCH MORE IN FAVOR OF A BILL THAT SIMPLY. IF YOU FEEL THERE'S ILLEGAL ACTIVITY GOING ON THAT EITHER DOES SOMETHING TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT DOES NOT HAPPEN AT STATE FAIRGROUNDS OUR DOES NOT HAPPEN IN THE STATE AS A WHOLE. I JUST DON'T SEE WHERE THIS MOVES THE BOOK THE BALL FORWARD IN TERMS OF MAKING CALIFORNIANS FOR SAFE. IS THAT A QUESTION ARE. YOU CAN ANSWERED IN YOUR CLOTHES. OKAY ARE YOU COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. CENA YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU SHARE AND I JUST WANTED TO RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE WITH THE OPPOSITION- I DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE BE TRUTHFUL AS THEY REPEATEDLY STATED- BUT I IT IS NOT TRUTHFUL TO STATE THAT THERE ARE NO ILLEGAL FIREARMS ARE UNLICENSED FIREARMS SOLD AT GUN SHOWS. AS YOU HEARD FROM THE FORMER CHIEF OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE'S BUREAU FIREARMS THERE ARE MANY INSTANCES OF THIS IN FACT I BELIEVE THAT IN A RECENT SENATE REPORT I WAS TOLD THIS ANECDOTALLY- THE SAME CONCLUSIONS REACH WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE MANY INSTANCES. OF ILLEGAL AND UNLICENSED FIREARMS BEING SOLD AT GUN SHOWS- I ALSO WANT TO DISAGREE RESPECTFULLY WITH THE- ASSESSMENT ON THE SEVEN MINUTE WE'VE REFERRED TO COUNCIL I WE DO NOT BELIEVE THERE'S A SECOND AMENDMENT ISSUE I APPRECIATE THE CONSTITUTIONAL WHILE LAST NIGHT WAS A FORMER LAW PROFESSOR BUT I TAUGHT CONTRACTS SO I'M NOT A CONSTITUTIONAL LAW EXPERT MYSELF- BUT THE DECISION THOSE REFERENCE MCDONALD V. CHICAGO. SIMPLY STATES AS I UNDERSTAND IT THAT THE SECOND AMENDMENT APPLIES TO STATES AND LOCALITIES THAT'S SIMPLY SAYS THAT WE HAVE TO RESPECT THE RIGHT TO BEAR ARMS WITH AS PART OF A RIGHT WELL REGULATED MILITIA. IT DOES NOT SAY ANYWHERE IN THE SECOND AMENDMENT THE STATE'S MUST USE THEIR PROPERTY TO SELL GUNS THAT WE MUST BE COMPLICIT IN THIS AND THIS GETS ME TO SOMEONE RECORDS QUESTION. I BELIEVE RIGHT NOW LOOK HERE'S AFFECT. GUN SHOWS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR A HIGH PROPORTION.OF GUNS BEING SOLD IN THE STATE SO THERE'S ALWAYS THE WHAT IF WILL THAT. BE LIKE A COMPRESSION WE'RE JUST MOVING GUNS INTO. LESS REGULATED PARTS I DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER TO THAT- OTHER THAN RIGHT NOW THEY'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR INORDINATE NUMBER OF GUNS I WE DON'T HAVE STATISTICS I ASKED- IN ORANGE COUNTY DO WE KNOW WHERE THE GUN THAT WAS USED TO KILL A LEO'S THE SIX YEAR OLD BOY WHO WAS KILLED IN ACT ROAD RAGE CAME FROM. AND I TOLD ME WE WOULD GET BACK TO ME. BUT WE KNOW IT WAS LEGALLY PURCHASED WHICH MEANS PROBABLY IS A FIFTY FIFTY CHANCE THAT WAS PURCHASED AT A GUN SHOW IN ORANGE COUNTY SINCE I BELIEVE. THAT ROUGHLY 50% OF GUNS IN MY AREA ARE ARE PURCHASED AT THE GUN SHOWS. THAT THAT IS JUST AN UNACCEPTABLE CROSS TO BEAR AND WE SOLVE THAT PROBLEM NOW BUT I ALSO THINK WE ESTABLISH A LINE IN THE SAND. THAT SAYS THE STATE SHALL NOT BE COMPLICIT THAT WERE THE ARGUMENTS BEING MADE IN FAVOR GUN SHOWS OTHER THAN I THINK THE- FACTUALLY WRONG ONCE ABOUT THE SECOND AMENDMENT OR LOCAL CONTROL. OUR ARGUMENTS AROUND REVENUES ESSENTIALLY BUT THE REVENUES THAT THESE COUNTY FAIRGROUNDS RECEIVED FROM THESE GUN SHOWS IS A SMALL FRACTION. OF THE TERRIFYING COSTS OF GUN VIOLENCE SO WITH ALL THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. MOTIONS SECOND. AB MEDAL SECTOR CALL THE ROLL. I'M SB TWO SIX FOUR BY MEN THE MOTION TO PASS TO THE UPPER COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER JONES SAWYER IRAQ. BAUER-KAHAN LEAD. COURT NOT QUICK NOT VOTING SANTA C. R. TELL NO C. OUR TURN NOW WICKS.

YOU MAY BEGIN BUT I THINK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I REALLY APPRECIATE TO TEN AFTER THE OF THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE IF IT'S BEEN A VERY LONG MEETING BUT VERY INTERESTING- I BEGIN BY AFFIRMING THAT YEAR PCA IS SUPPORTIVE OF ANY EFFORTS TO ENSURE THAT VOTERS ARE NOT HE- SAID VOTER PRIVACY IS PROTECTED AND INTEGRITY PRESERVED. AND MANY TENANTS OF SB THIRTY FIVE SEEK THOSE BANDS AND WE ABSOLUTELY SUPPORT DEVELOPMENT BUT SB THIRTY FIVE PROPOSED CHANGE TO SECTION SIX OF ELECTION CODE EIGHTEEN FIVE SIXTY EIGHT REGARDING OFFICIAL VERSUS UNOFFICIAL BALLOT COLLECTION BOXES THIS IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO WRITE A PREVIOUS WRONG AND GREATLY INCREASE VOTER PROTECTION. WHEN AB NINETEEN TWENTY ONE WITH PASSED ALLOWING UNRESTRICTED AND UNREGULATED BALLOT HARVESTING IT DID MORE THAN JUST PROVIDE VOTERS WITH ONE MORE WAY TO SUBMIT THEIR BALLOT WITHOUT LIFTING A FINGER IT ALSO UNLEASHED VAST OPPORTUNITIES FOR VOTERS TO BE HARASSED CAJOLED PRESSURED REMUNERATED OR ILLEGALLY HELPED AND THEIR BALLOTS TO BE SUBJECTED TO OUTSIDE FILTERING THROUGH WELL FUNDED DOOR TO DOOR CAMPAIGNS. YOUR PCA HAS CLEAR DOCUMENTATION THAT ALL OF THE ABOVE HAS OCCURRED EACH ELECTION SINCE AND SO TO LEGAL AUTHORITY TO ACTUALLY PROSECUTE IT OUT OF CONTROL BALLOT COLLECTORS IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN AB NINETEEN TWENTY ONE PRESENTED AND CONTINUES TO PRESENT A THREAT NOT ONLY TO ELECTION INTEGRITY BUT THE PUBLIC SAFETY AND CITIZENS RIGHTS THE CAPTAIN I'M INFLUENCED VOTE. AB NINETEEN TWENTY ONE ALSO OBLITERATED CHAIN OF CUSTODY WHEN BALLOT FALL OUTSIDE IN THE CUSTODY OF FEDERAL A U. S. P. S. OFFICIALS AND COUNTY ELECTIONS OFFICIAL LOSING CHAIN OF CUSTODY NAME OF ALL PROTECTION AND SECURITY INTERDICTING SERIOUS THE LEGITIMATE DOUBT INTO ELECTION RESULTS. LAST WEEK THE FOOTPRINT PART OF THE UNITED STATES ISSUED A SIX TO THREE RULING THEY CONSIDERED THE MOST IMPORTANT OF THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE SESSION BY RELEASING. IT LAST AND WITH GREAT POMP AND SAN. WITH RESPECT TO- RIGHT TO PER. BALLOT HARPER THEY RULED THAT STATES HAVE A- INTEREST. IN PREVENTING VOTER AND THAT THE POLICIES WERE. TO PREVENT SUCH STRONG. THEY CONTINUE TO SAY THAT IN. THAT EVERY VOTER CASTS BREEDING WITHOUT INTENDED OR UNDUE INFLUENCE IS A VALID AND IMPORTANT STATE INTERESTS. CALIFORNIA IS REALLY OUT OF STEP WITH THE SCOTUS RULING CALIFORNIA SHOULD CONTINUE TO SEEK TO MAKE IT EASIER IF POSSIBLE FOR CITIZENS TO REGISTER AND VOTE. AT THE SAME TIME PROTECTING BOTH VOTERS AND THE ABSOLUTE INTEGRITY THOSE VOTE. IF THE LEGISLATURE HOLD ELECTION INTEGRITY AND PUBLIC TRUST IN ANY REGARD IT SHOULD NOT JUST SPEAK TO PASS A TINY LEAK IN THE BALLOT HARVESTING THEN. IT SHOULD AMANDA SB THIRTY FIVE TO REFORM THE BALLOT HARVESTING ALL TOGETHER AND RE INSTITUTE BALLOT CHAIN OF CUSTODY THEN AFTER THE THIRTY FIVE WOULD BE A STRONG VOTER PROTECTION BILL WORTHY OF SUPPORT. THANK YOU. SO MUCH FOR LISTENING THANK YOU. NOW LOOKING TO ROOM FOR ANY WITNESS. IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE WILL GO TO TELE CONFERENCE A REDESIGN C.
