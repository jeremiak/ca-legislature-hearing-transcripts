BELL CABALLERO DAWALY FURTADO JONES LEYVA. MCGUIRE MONNING MORLOCK PAN. SKINNER STERN STONE NUMBER URUGUAY KASKI WE HAVE A- THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF THE SECRETARY NOTICES THE PRESENCE OF A QUORUM GOOD MORNING EVERYONE WE'VE JUST GOT ONE ITEM BEFORE US TODAY WHICH IS A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT TO CHANGE HOW WE BUDGET FOR THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE MISTER OBERNOLTE IS HERE TO PRESENT THAT BIPARTISAN MEHSUD MEASURE AC ELEVEN. WE WILL THEN ALLOW TIME FOR QUESTIONS AND PUBLIC COMMENT BUT BEFORE MR OBERNOLTE BEGINS IF YOU DON'T MIND SIR I'D LIKE TO BRIEFLY REFLECTED SOME OF THE CONVERSATION THAT I WAS A PART OF THAT LED TO THIS MEASURE LAST YEAR YOU ALL WILL RECALL THAT THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE CONDUCTED AN EXTENSIVE EXECUTIVE SEARCH FOR THE NEW ALBUM ALLEN. THIS WAS A BI PARTISAN A BY CAMEL PROCESS THAT RESULTED IN THE HIRING OF MR PADDICK THE NEW ALLEN WHO'S HERE WITH US TODAY. IN ADDITION THE SEARCH PROCESS ALLOWED FOR DIALOGUE ABOUT OUR EXPECTATIONS OF THE LA AND THEIR GROWING WORKLOADS AS WELL AS THE NEED TO REINVEST IN THE OFFICE. THE CAP ON THE LEGISLATURE'S BUDGET HAS ARTIFICIALLY PREVENTED THE NONPARTISAN LA L. STAFF FROM KEEPING PACE WITH THE GROWTH OF THE STATE BUDGET AND THE ADMINISTRATION'S OF FISCAL STAFF. THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE FOLLOW UP ON THESE DISCUSSIONS BY HOLDING A HEARING REGARDING THE LA L. EARLIER THIS YEAR. I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH MR OLD BANALITY AND APPRECIATE YOU ALLOWING ME TO SIGN ONAS A CO AUTHOR OF THE MEASURE. THAT IT'S TIME TO GIVE THE VOTERS AN OPPORTUNITY TO ALLOW FOR REINVESTMENT IN THE AUDIO. I APPRECIATE HIS OFFICE SHIP OF THIS MEASURE AND THEM AGAIN PROP CO AUTHOR WITH THAT. CITY TO NIELSEN IS IT HERE I'M GONNA GO AHEAD AND GET STARTED. WITH MR OBERNOLTE PRESENTING A C. ELEVEN GOOD MORNING SIR MORNING THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS. BY THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE HAS BEEN AN INTEGRAL PART OF STATE GOVERNMENT FOR ALMOST EIGHTY YEARS NOW OTHER ESTABLISHED IN NINETEEN FORTY ONE. TO PROVIDE NONPARTISAN UNBIASED FINANCIAL ADVICE TO THE LEGISLATURE THEY'RE MEANT TO BE THE COUNTER WEIGHT TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. AND THEY HAVE PERFORMED ADMIRABLY IN THAT ROLE THEY'VE BEEN A VERY VALUABLE ADDITION. IN NINETEEN NINETY PROP ONE FORTY WAS PASSED BY THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA THAT WAS VERY SPECIAL INTERESTS TO TERM LIMITS. STRICT LIMITS ON EXPENDITURES BY THE LEGISLATURE BUT ONE OF THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF PROP ONE FORTY. IS THAT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE BUDGET WAS CUT BECAUSE TECHNICALLY THERE UNDERNEATH THE SAME BUDGET ITEM AS THE LEGISLATURE AS A DEPARTMENT OF THE LEGISLATURE'S. NINE NINETY. YOUR PROP ON. THE LA OWES STAFF WAS PRODUCED BY 60% THINK ABOUT THAT OVER HALF. PRIOR TO NINE NINETY. BUT WAIT NOT JUST A BUT IT WAS DONE IN THE BILL. CREATION AND THEY WOULD GIVE A PRICE OF THOSE BILLS SINCE THEN THEY'VE BEEN THEY HAD TO LIMIT THE SCOPE OF THEIR ACTIVITIES TO ONLY. BETTING ADVICE ON BUDGET ITEMS ON THE VERY LARGEST APPROPRIATIONS AND BILLS. SO I DON'T THINK THAT THAT'S A GOOD THING FOR THE LEGISLATURE RIGHT NOW THE LA HAS ROUGHLY THE SAME NUMBER OF ANALYSTS AS THEY DID IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES AND TO GIVE YOU SOME CONTEXT. THE STATE BUDGET HAS GROWN BY OVER 5000% SINCE THEN IN OTHER WORDS AND OVER FIFTY TIMES AND THEY'RE DOING THAT ANALYSIS WITH THE SAME NUMBER. OF ANALYSTS SO NO I'M A SMALL GOVERNMENT GUY WANT TO KEEP THE SIZE OF GOVERNMENT AS SMALL AS POSSIBLE BUT I MAKE AN EXCEPTION WHEN IT COMES TO. THE AGENCY THAT WERE TRUSTING HELP US MAKE GOOD DECISIONS WHEN I COME TO FISCAL EXPENDITURES. BY THIS CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT ECA ELEVEN WOULD PROTECT AND BACK BEFORE THE VOTE. WHETHER OR NOT THE LA SHOULD BE WITHIN THE SAME BUDGET. LINE UP I'M AS THE- TEACHER WHETHER NOT THEY SHOULD HAVE. THEIR SAY. THEIR OWN. I STRUCK BELIEVE IT SHOULDN'T MATTER I THINK THE WILL OF WITH US I WOULD REQUEST RIVAL NACA ELEVEN HAPPY HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE. QUESTION ANY QUESTIONS FOR THE AUTHOR THE BILL. A GOOD WE HAVE A MOTION A MISTER THIS ONE OFTEN DO YOU HAVE ANY COMMENT ON BEHALF OF THE ADMINISTRATION. YES. VEGAS WOULD OFTEN DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WE'LL MAKE A COUPLE OF BRIEF COMMENTS AND THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU MISTER MOORE OBERNOLTE. TO THE PART OF FINANCE WORKS VERY CLOSELY WITH LA OUT THROUGHOUT THE BUDGET PROCESS AND THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. ON THIS PROPOSED CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS AND SEND THE MINISTRATION HAVE NOT TAKEN A POSITION. HOWEVER BEFORE THE COMMITTEE VOTES WE DO WANT TO NOTE THREE KEY ISSUES. FIRST WE NOTE THAT IF THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE IF THIS AMENDMENT WERE TO PASS A IT'S UNCLEAR WHERE EXACTLY IT WOULD BE FUNDED BY THERE WOULD STILL BE FUNDED. WITHIN THE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET OR WHETHER IT WOULD BE A SEPARATE GENERAL FUND ITEM AND IF IT WERE A SEPARATE GENERAL FUND ITEM OR IF THERE WERE A MARGINAL INCREASE. IN THE LA BUDGET BEYOND WHAT'S IN THE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET RIGHT NOW THAT FUNDING WOULD NO LONGER BE AVAILABLE FOR OTHER GENERAL FUND PURPOSES. THE SECOND POINT I WANT TO MAKE IT IF THE COMES A SEPARATE GENERAL FUND ITEM. DÃ¢N EIGHT LEVEL FUNDING THERE WOULD BE CONTINGENT ON THE OVERALL BUDGET PROCESS. AND AS A RESULT IN A POSSIBLE FUTURE YEAR FUTURE ADMINISTRATION. FUNDING FOR THE L. L. MAY NOT BE GUARANTEED UNDER THAT SCENARIO. AND FINANCE NOTES THAT DURING THE NINETEEN NINETIES AT THE GOVERNOR AT THE TIME IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES. VETOED FUNDING FOR THE COMMISSION ON STATE FINANCE WHICH PERFORMED REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE FORECASTING AND THAT FIND A FUNDING WAS NOT SUBSEQUENTLY. RESTORED AND FINALLY FINANCE ONE OF THE PROPOSED AMENDMENT. DOES NOT CHANGE THE CAP ON TOTAL AGGREGATE EXPENDITURES OF THE LEGISLATURE. RATHER IT STATES THAT LA EXPENDITURES SHALL NOT BE INCLUDED IN CALCULATING THOSE EXPENDITURES FOR THE LEGISLATURE. AND SO THIS IS JUST TO SAY THAT IN THE FUTURE SUBJECT TO THE CELL. APPROPRIATIONS WOMEN IN THE TOTAL AT AVERAGE EXPENDITURE LIMITS BUT THAT WOULD STILL BE SUBJECT TO LEGISLATIVE BUDGET TO NEGOTIATIONS. BETWEEN THE LEGISLATURE AND THE ADMINISTRATION. THANK YOU ARE WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE AND PROVIDE ANY COMMENTS OR ANY RESPONSE THE MINISTRATION. THANK YOU FOR THE COMMENTARY I THOUGHT I'M IN AGREEMENT WITH EVERYTHING THAT WAS SAID I THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE FOR THAT TO BE A BUDGETARY DISCUSSION. WE HAVE HAD HISTORICALLY OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF DECADES VERY PRODUCTIVE RELATIONSHIPS WITH BOTH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND THE ADMINISTRATION. I THINK THE POINT THAT YOU'RE MAKING IS IN THE FUTURE IF MAYBE THE RELATIONSHIP WAS NOT SO HARMONIOUS THAT THIS MIGHT BE A CONTENTIOUS ISSUE. AND I THINK THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD DEAL WITH WHEN THE TIME COMES BUT FOR THE MEAN TIME I DON'T THINK IT'S HEALTHY. FOR US TO BE IN A SITUATION WHERE WE GOT 60% FEWER ANALYSTS THAN WE DID. BEFORE NINETEEN NINETY IN A BUDGET THAT CONTINUES TO GROW IN COMPLEXITY STATE GOVERNMENT THE CONTINUES TO GROSS. THIS IS A GOOD FOR ONLY CAL ABOUT OUR LEGISLATIVE I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST RIGHT. THAT NUMBER JUST. QUICK THINGS BEFORE I GO TO DOCTOR PAN AND SENATOR ROBB. THE FALL I DON'T KNOW IF YOU TO THE OPENING. ASSEMBLY MEMBER BUT YOU KNOW THERE'S ADDITIONAL WORK THAT WE HAVE PUT ON THE BACKS FRANKLY THEY'LL ANNOUNCE THEIR- ANALYSIS OF ALL THE BALLOT. IT IS RENDON THAT'S IN. THE NUMBER OF. KIDS THAT ARE ON. ALAN GROSS THAT. WHATEVER FUTURE ADMINISTRATION WOULD BE WILLING TO UNDERSTAND ON THE IMPORTANCE OF THE LA L. TO THE LEGISLATURE AND NOT PUSH BACK ON FUNDING FOR LA EITHER WITH THAT SENATOR PAN. THANK YOU AND OF THE SENATE OBERNOLTE THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD CERTAINLY AND SUPPORT I JUST. WANTED CLEAR FIGHTS AS A THIRD FINANCES TESTIMONY AND MAYBE JUST A MISPERCEPTION MY PART BUT- BASICALLY ANY CURRENTLY THE LA ANY DALY AS WITHIN THE CAP RIGHT NOW. WE STILL HAVE TO BUDGET FOR HOW MUCH THE LA ACT I MEAN IT'S NOT LIKE THEY HAVE A GUARANTEED AMOUNT OF MONEY. IS THAT YES SAID THAT THAT IT THAT IS CORRECT THE ONE DIFFERENCE IS THAT RIGHT NOW IN THE BUDGET ACT THAT'S ENACTED. DE APPROPRIATIONS FOR THE LA IS A TRANSFER FROM THE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET SO THEN THE OVERALL IT IT'LL SHOW WAS ZERO IN THE BUDGET ACT AND DAN IT'S BASICALLY FROM THE OVERALL LEGISLATIVE BUDGET MONEY GOES FROM THERE. TO THE LA OUT RIGHT BUT IN IN BUT I MEAN IT IS PART OF THE BUDGET SO IT'S- SO IS A UNILATERAL DECISION BY THE LEGISLATURE HOW MUCH. GETS OUT OF OUR ALLOCATION OR AS PART OF THE BUDGET AGREEMENT THAT THE GOVERNOR ALSO SIGNED SAID THIS IS HOW MUCH WENT TO THE L. L. SO IT IS IN THE OVERALL BUDGET AGREEMENT BUT IT IS PART OF THE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET RIGHT AND IN FACT ACTUALLY AS SOON OBERNOLTE JUST TO CLARIFY. THERE'S IS THERE ANY PROVISION IN THIS PARTICULAR A CPA THAT PREVENTS THE LEGISLATURE IF WE WISH TO ACTUALLY DESIGNATE PART OF ALLOCATION TO THE LA IF FOR SOME REASON NOW DURING A DOWNTURN THAT WAS GONNA BE PART OF THE BUDGET SOLUTION TO FULLY FUND THE ALE CERTAIN. ABOUT THAT JUST THIS IS VERY SIMPLE IT SIMPLY REMOVES THE LA FROM THAT CAPITA IS NOT SAY WHERE THE FUNDING FOR THE LA COMES FROM RIGHT SO THEREFORE IT'S BASICALLY BE DISCUSSION BETWEEN THE LEGISLATURE THE GOVERNOR OF COURSE THE LEGISLATURE LEGISLATORS AND THE GOVERNOR WILL SIDES SIGNED SO. I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THAT ISSUE JUST TO. THAT I MEAN I DON'T THINK THERE'S I DON'T SEE THIS AS BEING A CREATING AN- INCREASE OF OWN ABILITY TO THE L. L. IN TERMS OF THE FUNDING. THANK YOU. SENATOR ROBB THING THEN I'M FEATURES DELIGHTED TO EVEN THOUGH I DON'T RECOGNIZE YOU ANYMORE. I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT I'M DELIGHTED TO SUPPORT THIS I CERTAINLY HOPE. CERTAINLY HOPE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION. RECOGNIZES THE IMPORTANCE OF THE WORK IS PERFORMED BY THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE BUT NOT ONLY TO US. BUT ALSO TO THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE IN THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IN TERMS OF FLUSHING OUT AND MAKING RICH% THE CONVERSATION IN THE DIALOGUE OVER THE- SOMETIMES VERY HEAVY BUDGET ISSUES. THERE WE HAVE TO GRAPPLE WITH HERE. JUST AS WE RECOGNIZE THAT IN TIMES OF A BUDGET CRUNCH WHEN THINGS ARE TOUGH IN CALIFORNIA. WE MAY HAVE TO MAKE IT JUST WE WILL MAKE ADJUSTMENTS OBVIOUSLY TO OUR BUDGET. AND WE MAY HAVE TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS TO THE OFFICE OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AND DEPARTMENT OF FINANCES BUDGET AT THE SAME TIME AS WE TAKE A LOOK AT THE LA SO IT'S JUST IT'S NOT A ONE SIDED THING HERE. IN TIMES OF DIFFICULTY WE ALL MAY HAVE TO TAKE A HER CUT HOPEFULLY NOT SO I'LL BE SUPPORTING THIS THANK YOU SIR FOR BRINGING IT. IF YOU OF ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS.
